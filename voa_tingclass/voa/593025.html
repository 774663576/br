<p style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: center"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 宋体, SimSun;"><img alt="121723.jpg" src="http://online2.tingclass.net//fuwenben/upload/image/20241217/1734408163224054.jpg" title="1734408163224054.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 2em"><span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong><span style="font-family: 宋体, SimSun;">英文原文</span></strong></span></p><p style="text-indent: 2em"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 宋体, SimSun;">Cold weather has a great effect on how our minds and our bodies work. Perhaps that is why we have so many expressions that combine the word "cold" with body parts. The most straightforward example is the adjective "coldhearted." Just as it sounds, a coldhearted person is distant and, well, cold. An action can be cold-hearted as well. This would be one that shows no love or sympathy. There are many songs about cold-hearted men or cold-hearted women who, without feeling, broke the hearts of their lovers.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 2em"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 宋体, SimSun;">寒冷天气对我们的思维方式和身体机能有着巨大的影响。也许这就是为什么我们有很多将“冷”这个词与身体部位结合的表达方式。最直接的例子就是形容词“冷酷的”。顾名思义，冷酷的人就是冷漠无情的。行为也可以很冷酷。这指的是不表现出任何爱意或同情心的行为。有很多歌曲是关于冷酷的男性或女性，他们无情地伤害了恋人的心。</span></p><p style="text-indent: 2em"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 宋体, SimSun;">In the 1988 song "Coldhearted," Paula Abdul sings about the coldhearted man who broke her heart. The song was a huge hit. It seems a trend may have been set. In 2010, the Zack Brown Band released a song with the exact same name.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 2em"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 宋体, SimSun;">在1988年的歌曲《冷酷无情》中，Paula Abdul唱出了那个让她心碎的冷酷无情之人。这首歌取得了巨大的成功。似乎已经成为了一种潮流。2010年，Zack Brown Band发行了一首同名歌曲。</span></p><p style="text-indent: 2em"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 宋体, SimSun;">Other similar adjectives often get a hyphen, like "cold-blooded." Reptiles, amphibians, and most fish are cold-blooded animals. This means they are unable to control their own body temperature. Mammals, on the other hand, are warm-blooded—well, for the most part. There are some people in the world you could call cold-blooded. People who show no emotions or feelings are often described as cold-blooded. Cold-blooded people are hard to get close to, and they often do terrible things on purpose. For example, the police might look for someone they call a cold-blooded killer. The person killed someone without any understandable cause, not in self-defense, fear, or even anger. Killing for no reason is often called cold-blooded.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 2em"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 宋体, SimSun;">其他类似的形容词常常带有连字符，比如“冷血的”。爬行动物、两栖动物和大多数鱼类都是冷血动物。这意味着它们无法控制自己的体温。而哺乳动物，在大多数情况下，是温血动物。世界上有些人可以被称作冷血。那些没有感情的人通常被描述为冷血。冷血的人很难接近，而且常常故意做可怕的事情。例如，警察可能会寻找他们所说的冷血杀手。这个杀手没有任何可以理解的原因就杀了人，既不是自卫，也不是出于恐惧，甚至不是出于愤怒。无缘无故的杀戮通常被称为冷血。</span></p><p style="text-indent: 2em"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 宋体, SimSun;">Okay, enough of cold-blooded people. Let's go back to fish. As we said earlier, most are cold-blooded. So calling a striped bass or rainbow trout a "cold fish" is fine. They would not be insulted if they could be insulted. But calling a person a "cold fish" is an insult. A cold fish is a person who is unfriendly, unemotional, and shows no love or warmth. Cold fish do not offer much of themselves to anyone. However, not everyone who doesn't show their feelings is a cold fish. Some people keep their feelings to themselves until they know you better. We could describe these people with the phrase "cold hands, warm heart." This means that a person may be very kind and warm, but they just don't show their feelings very easily. Take my friend Celeste as an example. She doesn't normally show her feelings, but she is always ready to help and is very kind. She is a classic case of "cold hands, warm heart."</span></p><p style="text-indent: 2em"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 宋体, SimSun;">好了，关于冷血的人就说到这里。让我们回到鱼类。如前所述，大多数鱼类都是冷血动物。所以把条纹鲈鱼或虹鳟鱼称为“冷血鱼”是可以的。如果它们能被冒犯的话，它们也不会被冒犯。但是把一个人称为“冷血鱼”是一种侮辱。冷血鱼是指那些不友好、没有感情、没有爱和温暖的人。冷血鱼不会对任何人付出太多。然而，并不是所有不表达感情的人都是冷血鱼。有些人会把感情藏在心里，直到他们更了解你。我们可以用“面冷心热”来形容这些人。这意味着一个人可能非常善良和热情，但他们就是不太容易表达感情。以我的朋友Celeste为例。她通常不表达感情，但她总是乐于助人，非常善良。她是“面冷心热”的典型代表。</span></p><p style="text-indent: 2em"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 宋体, SimSun;">Speaking of hands, the hands and feet are some of the first body parts to feel the cold. Getting cold feet is no fun, outdoors or in conversation. To get cold feet means to become afraid to do something you had already decided to do. We use this expression in situations that make us nervous or afraid, from leading a big meeting at work to singing on stage in front of strangers. But we commonly use it in connection with weddings. People who are about to get married may begin to feel nervous as the day nears. They begin to question if they should take such a big step. If a bride shares these feelings of nervousness and uncertainty, a relative or friend might answer with, "Don't worry, this is a classic case of cold feet."</span></p><p style="text-indent: 2em"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 宋体, SimSun;">说到手，手和脚是最先感受到寒冷的身体部位之一。感到畏缩（退缩）可不好玩，无论是在户外还是交谈中。感到畏缩意味着你害怕去做已经决定要做的事情。我们在感到紧张或害怕的情况下会使用这个表达，从主持工作中的大型会议到在陌生人面前登台演唱。但我们通常把它与婚礼联系起来。即将结婚的人可能会随着日子的临近而感到紧张。他们开始怀疑自己是否应该迈出这么重要的一步。如果新娘有紧张和不确定的感觉，亲戚或朋友可能会回答说：“别担心，这是典型的婚前恐惧症。”</span></p><p style="text-indent: 2em"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 宋体, SimSun;">Another body part involved in our cold expressions today is the shoulder. You give someone the cold shoulder when you refuse to speak to them; you ignore them. The expression probably comes from the physical act of turning your back towards someone. You may give a cold shoulder to a friend who has broken a promise or to someone who has said mean things about others.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 2em"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 宋体, SimSun;">今天另一个“寒冷（cold）”表达中涉及到的身体部位是肩膀。当你拒绝和某人说话时，你对那人是冷淡（cold shoulder）的；你无视他们。这个表达可能源于转身背对着某人的这种身体行为。你也许会对不守信的朋友或是说别人坏话的人很冷淡。</span></p> </div>
