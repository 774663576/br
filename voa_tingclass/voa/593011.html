<p style="text-indent: 2em; text-align: center"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 宋体, SimSun;"><img alt="121523.jpg" src="http://online2.tingclass.net//fuwenben/upload/image/20241213/1734069457574702.jpg" title="1734069457574702.jpg"/></span></p><p style="text-indent: 2em"><span style="font-size: 16px;"><strong><span style="font-family: 宋体, SimSun;">英文原文</span></strong></span></p><p style="text-indent: 2em"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 宋体, SimSun;">You just need to make a choice, a choice that you're going to stop being bitter, a choice that you're going to stop looking back, a choice that you are not going to waste one more day of your life feeling sorry for yourself. And I know you may have issues in you, but you're doing better than you think you are. Somebody needs to know that today you're gonna make it. Somebody needs to know today that you're doing all right. And you may not be what you ought to be, but you're not what you used to be, and you're gonna get there. </span></p><p style="text-indent: 2em"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 宋体, SimSun;">你只需要做出一个选择，一个选择停止怨恨的决定，一个选择不再回首的决定，一个决定不再浪费生命中的任何一天为自己感到抱歉的决定。我知道你可能有一些问题，但你做得比你自己认为的要好。有人需要知道，今天你将成功。有人需要知道，今天你做得很好。你可能还没有达到你应该达到的高度，但你也不再是过去的你了，你将会到达那里。</span></p><p style="text-indent: 2em"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 宋体, SimSun;">Don't you give up. Don't quit, and don't you keep putting yourself down. You're doing better than you think you are. This is not how your story ends. Look again, there's another. There's a new beginning. You just know that you need to keep growing. Be disciplined, be committed, and have heart to be consistent. </span></p><p style="text-indent: 2em"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 宋体, SimSun;">不要放弃。不要退缩，也不要再贬低自己。你做得比你自己认为的要好。你的故事不会这样结束。再看看，还有另一个可能。还有一个新的开始。你知道你需要不断成长。要有自律，要有承诺，并有心保持一致性。</span></p><p style="text-indent: 2em"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 宋体, SimSun;">If you get up and you just have no discipline whatsoever, you get no value out of anything. Your diets don't work when you don't do them. Exercise doesn't work when you don't do it. Like, what is the fire that stirs you? That you wake up saying, "I will do this, even when I don't feel like it. I will do whatever it takes to overcome my temptation for mediocrity, my temptation for excuses, my temptation for reasons and circumstances that hold me back. I won't allow those to be in my way." And if you have that within you, you'll achieve whatever you choose. Nothing will be different until you think differently. Nothing will be different until we think differently.</span></p><p style="text-indent: 2em"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 宋体, SimSun;">如果你起床后毫无自律，那么你将一事无成。如果你不执行，你的饮食计划就不会起作用。如果你不锻炼，锻炼就不会起作用。那么，是什么激励了你呢？让你醒来时说：“我会去做，即使我不想。我会尽一切努力克服平庸的诱惑，借口的诱惑，以及阻碍我的理由和环境的诱惑。我不会让这些成为我的绊脚石。”如果你内心有这样的力量，你就能实现你所选择的任何事情。除非你改变想法，否则一切都会保持不变。除非我们改变想法，否则一切都会保持不变。</span></p> </div>
