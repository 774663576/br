<p>你记得总公司的John吗?</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>记得。</p>
<p>Have you heard what happened to him?</p>
<p>你有没有听说他出了什么事?</p>
<p>No, what?</p>
<p>没有。怎么了?</p>
<p>He had his car stolen.</p>
<p>他的车被偷了。</p>
<p>Actually he was kidnapped while he was in the car.</p>
<p>他等于是被绑架了，因为他当时在车里。</p>
<p>What do you mean?</p>
<p>你的意思是?</p>
<p>Well, apparently, he was just getting into his car,</p>
<p>哦，他显然是才刚上车。</p>
<p>He'd parked it in one of those underground multi-story things-he was just getting in andsuddenly three guys with guns opened the back doors of the car and got in.</p>
<p>他把车停在那些多层式地下停车场的其中一层，他一上车，就有三个持枪的歹徒突然打开后车门跳进去。</p>
<p>Crikey. Where did this happen?</p>
<p>哎哟。这件事在哪里发生的?</p>
<p>In Taichung, I think.</p>
<p>我想是在台中。</p>
<p>Oh, right, I hear they have a lot of this kind of problem down there.</p>
<p>嗅，对，我听说当地有很多这类问题。</p>
<p>Really? Well anyway, they pointed their guns at him and said, you know, keep calm and driveout.</p>
<p>真的吗?反正他们就拿枪指着他说，静静把车开出去就对了。</p>
<p>We don't want to hurt you...we just want your car.</p>
<p>我们不想伤害你，我们只是要你的车而已。</p>
<p>So what happened?</p>
<p>所以结果呢?</p>
<p>Well, he drove out, and when he got to the booth to pay the attendant, he pretended to havean epileptic fit, you know, to scare the thieves away.</p>
<p>哦，他把车开出去，等开到票亭要缴钱给收费员时，便假装羊癫疯发作，你知道，以便把歹徒吓跑。</p>
<p>The attendant was no help at all: even though the guys were holding guns in plain view, hedid nothing.</p>
<p>但收费员根本置之不理，虽然眼睁睁看着那些人拿着枪，他却袖手旁观。</p>
<p>That's terrible.</p>
<p>太可怕了。</p>
<p>Yes, makes you think, doesn't it.</p>
<p>是啊，你连想都不敢想。</p>
<p>So what happened next?</p>
<p>所以接下来呢?</p>
<p>Well, he kept on pretending to have a fit, so they freaked out and just ran away.</p>
<p>额，他一直假装发病，于是他们便吓得逃走了。</p>
<p>Well, he sure was lucky.</p>
<p>噢，他真是走运。</p>
<p>I'll say.</p>
<p>我也这么觉得。</p>
