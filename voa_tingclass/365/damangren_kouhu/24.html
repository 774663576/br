<p>你听说财务部的Mike出事了吗?</p>
<p>No. What?</p>
<p>不知道。他怎么了?</p>
<p>He got arrested on Friday night and spent the nightin jail.</p>
<p>他星期五晚上被捕，而且被关了一个晚上。</p>
<p>No. Really, what happened?</p>
<p>不会吧。到底是怎么回事?</p>
<p>Well, it was all a big mistake, actually.</p>
<p>哦，其实是个大误会。</p>
<p>He got home on Friday night really late, and apparently he'd been out drinking with someclients, so he was really drunk.</p>
<p>他星期五晚上很晚才回家，他显然是和几个客户出去喝了几杯，而且喝得烂醉。</p>
<p>Was he out with the guys from the bank?</p>
<p>他是跟银行的那些人出去吗?</p>
<p>Yes, I think so.</p>
<p>我想是吧。</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, they always get really drunk.</p>
<p>噢，是啊，他们老是喝得烂醉。</p>
<p>Well, anyway, he'd somehow lost his wallet and his house keys, so he couldn't get in.</p>
<p>噢，反正他就是弄丢了钱包和家里的钥匙，所以没办法进门。</p>
<p>He lives alone, you know.</p>
<p>你也知道，他是一个人住。</p>
<p>Oh, really. I thought he lived with his wife.</p>
<p>真的嗅。我以为他跟老婆住在一起。</p>
<p>No, she left him last year.</p>
<p>并没有，她去年离开他了。</p>
<p>Oh, really? Do you know why?</p>
<p>嗅，真的吗?你知道是为什么吗?</p>
<p>Hang on, let me finish telling you what happened.</p>
<p>等等，先让我把事情的经过说完。</p>
<p>Where was I?</p>
<p>我说到哪儿了?</p>
<p>He lost his wallet and keys.</p>
<p>他弄丢了钱包和钥匙。</p>
<p>Oh yes, well, he tried to climb in through the bathroom window, but apparently he slipped andbroke the glass with his foot.</p>
<p>噢，对。他想从浴室的窗户爬进去，可是显然摔了一跤，脚踢碎了玻璃。</p>
<p>The neighbors heard him and thought a robbery was in progress, so they called the police.</p>
<p>邻居听到了声音，以为有人要闯入，于是叫警察来。</p>
<p>Oh, no.</p>
<p>噢，不会吧。</p>
<p>Yes. So when the cops arrived, they didn't believe his story:</p>
<p>是啊，结果警察来了以后，并不相信他的说法。</p>
<p>you know, he lost his wallet so he had no ID;</p>
<p>你也知道，他弄丢了钱包，所以身上没有身份证。</p>
<p>the neighbors were new and didn't know him, so he couldn't get the police to believe his story.</p>
<p>邻居是新来的，也不认识他，所以他没办法让警察相信他的说法。</p>
<p>So they arrested him and put him in a cell until the morning.</p>
<p>结果警察就逮捕了他，并把他关在构留所里，直到第二天早上。</p>
<p>So then what happened?</p>
<p>结果后来又怎么了?</p>
<p>Well, when he sobered up, he called someone from work to come and bail him out.</p>
<p>哦，等他酒醒以后，他打电话请公司的人来保他出去。</p>
<p>Well, that's a bit of a tricky situation.</p>
<p>俄，这种情况不太好处理。</p>
<p>Yes, I know.</p>
<p>是啊，我知道。</p>
