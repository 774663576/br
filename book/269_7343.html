<div class="line_en">School and work were the only exceptions, and the dreary, dull yellow walls of my classrooms had become oddly inviting to me of late. That had a lot to do with the person who sat in the desk beside me.</div>

<div class="line_en">Almost everything was back to normal -- The good, pre-zombie normal -- in less time than I would have believed possible. The hospital welcomed Carlisle back with eager arms, not even bothering to conceal their delight that Esme had found life in L. A. so little to her liking. Thanks to the Calculus test I'd missed while abroad, Alice and Edward were in better to shape to graduate than I was at the moment. Suddenly, college was a priority (college was still plan B, on the off chance that Edward's offer swayed me from the post-graduation Carlisle option). Many deadlines had passed me by, but Edward had a new stack of applications for me to fill out every day. He'd already done the Harvard route, so it didn't bother him that, thanks to my procrastination, we might both end up at Peninsula Community College next year.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几乎一切都回到了原来的轨道上——那些善良的吸血鬼们也一如往常——比我预想的快。医院热烈欢迎卡莱尔的归来，毫不掩饰他们的欣喜——埃斯梅并不太喜欢洛杉矶的生活。多亏我不在的时候误掉的微积分考试，爱丽丝和爱德华比我以前更期盼毕业了。突然之间，大学成了重点（大学仍是B计划，以防万一爱德华动摇了我毕业后由卡莱尔转变的想法）。我已经度过了许多个最后期限，但是爱德华每天都有一大堆的申请表格让我填。他已经投递了哈佛大学，因此由于我的拖延，我们可能明年都要以在半岛社区学院而告终的事没有让他烦恼。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Almost, but not quite. There was the house arrest situation, for one thing. And for another, before the fall, I hadn't been best friends with Jacob Black. So, of course, I hadn't missed him then.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几乎是。但也不绝对。一则我受到了软禁；另一则，在秋天之前，我还不是雅各布 布雷克最好的朋友。因此，当然了，我至少没有错过他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Edward had resumed his schedule from the beginning of the year, which put him in most of my classes again. My behavior had been such last fall, after the Cullens' supposed move to L. A., that the seat beside me had never been filled. Even Mike, always eager to take any advantage, had kept a safe distance. With Edward back in place, it was almost as if the last eight months were just a disturbing nightmare.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从年初开始，我就幻想着爱德华还和以前一样继续他的日程安排，出现在我大多数的课堂上。从去年秋天开始，我就这么做了。自从库伦家搬到了洛杉矶，当然是假的了，我身边的座位就一直空着。即使是见缝插针的麦克也和我保持了一定距离。随着爱德华的归来，过去的那八个月简直就是一场噩梦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I made these calls mostly at night, after Edward had been kicked out -- promptly at nine by a grimly gleeful Charlie -- and before Edward snuck back through my window when Charlie was asleep. I chose that time to make my fruitless calls because I'd noticed that Edward made a certain face every time I mentioned Jacob's name. Sort of disapproving and wary… maybe even angry. I guessed that he had some reciprocal prejudice against the werewolves, though he wasn't as vocal as Jacob had been about the "bloodsuckers."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我多数在晚上打那些电话，就在爱德华被赶走之后——迅速的在酒店被严厉而又愉快的查理赶走——赶在查理睡觉之后爱德华从窗户溜回来之前。我挑好时间打那些无用的电话是因为我注意到每次我提到雅各布时，爱德华总会很敏感，有点不情愿，并且总是小心翼翼的。。。或许甚至时生气了。我猜他和狼人之间都有成见，尽管他不是雅各布所想的“鲜血猎食者”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">With Edward near me, it was hard to think about unhappy things -- even my former besi fnend, who was probably very unhappy right now, due to me. When I did think of Jake, I always felt guilty for not thinking of him more.</div>

He lounged against a mossy tree trunk as he waited, his face hard and bitter, exactly the way I knew it would be. He looked at me, and then at Edward. Jacob's mouth stretched into a humorless sneer, and he shrugged away from the tree. He stood on the balls of his bare feet, leaning slightly forward, with his trembling hands clenched into fists.
