<div class="line_en">As always, Winston was lying flat on his back. But of late his bonds were looser. They still held him to the bed, but he could move his knees a little and could turn his head from side to side and raise his arms from the elbow. The dial, also, had grown to be less of a terror. He could evade its pangs if he was quick-witted enough: it was chiefly when he showed stupidity that O'Brien pulled the lever. Sometimes they got through a whole session without use of the dial. He could not remember how many sessions there had been. The whole process seemed to stretch out over a long, indefinite time -- weeks, possibly -- and the intervals between the sessions might sometimes have been days, sometimes only an hour or two.</div>

Do you remember writing in your diary, 'I understand HOW: I do not understand WHY?' It was when you thought about 'why' that you doubted your own sanity.

<div class="line_en">Nevertheless Winston did not speak for another moment or two. A feeling of weariness had overwhelmed him. The faint, mad gleam of enthusiasm had come back into O'Brien's face. He knew in advance what O'Brien would say. That the Party did not seek power for its own ends, but only for the good of the majority. That it sought power because men in the mass were frail, cowardly creatures who could not endure liberty or face the truth, and must be ruled over and systematically deceived by others who were stronger than themselves. That the choice for mankind lay between freedom and happiness, and that, for the great bulk of mankind, happiness was better. That the party was the eternal guardian of the weak, a dedicated sect doing evil that good might come, sacrificing its own happiness to that of others. The terrible thing, thought Winston, the terrible thing was that when O'Brien said this he would believe it. You could see it in his face. O'Brien knew everything. A thousand times better than Winston he knew what the world was really like, in what degradation the mass of human beings lived and by what lies and barbarities the Party kept them there. He had understood it all, weighed it all, and it made no difference: all was justified by the ultimate purpose. What can you do, thought Winston, against the lunatic who is more intelligent than yourself, who gives your arguments a fair hearing and then simply persists in his lunacy?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，温斯顿一时没有说话。疲惫感压倒了他。狂热的神情又隐隐出现在奥布莱恩的脸上。他已经知道奥布莱恩要说什么。党不是为自己的利益寻求权力，而是为了大多数人的利益。党寻求权力，是因为人民大众软弱胆小，不能忍受自由和面对真理，必定被统治，并系统地受比他们更强的人的欺骗。人类的选择介于自由与幸福之间，对绝大部分人来说，幸福更好。党永远是弱者的卫士，是一个有奉献精神的宗派，作恶而带来善，为了他人的幸福而牺牲自己的幸福。温斯顿想，可怕的事情是当奥布莱恩这么说的时候，他会相信这些话。你可以从他脸上看出来。奥布莱恩什么都知道。他的见识比温斯顿高出一千倍。他知道这个世界实际是什么，人民大众生活在什么样的境况中，党如何通过谎言和暴力使他们处于那种地位。他理解这一切，权衡这一切，但这无关紧要，为了最终目标，一切都可以得到合理的解释。你能做什么，温斯顿想，反对一个比你有才智的疯子？他耐心地听你的辩解，接着固执己见。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Now I will tell you the answer to my question. It is this. The Party seeks power entirely for its own sake. We are not interested in the good of others; we are interested solely in power. Not wealth or luxury or long life or happiness: only power, pure power. What pure power means you will understand presently. We are different from all the oligarchies of the past, in that we know what we are doing. All the others, even those who resembled ourselves, were cowards and hypocrites. The German Nazis and the Russian Communists came very close to us in their methods, but they never had the courage to recognize their own motives. They pretended, perhaps they even believed, that they had seized power unwillingly and for a limited time, and that just round the corner there lay a paradise where human beings would be free and equal. We are not like that. We know that no one ever seizes power with the intention of relinquishing it. Power is not a means, it is an end. One does not establish a dictatorship in order to safeguard a revolution; one makes the revolution in order to establish the dictatorship. The object of persecution is persecution. The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power. Now do you begin to understand me?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“现在，我来告诉你对这个问题的回答。回答是这样的。党寻求权力完全是为了他自己。我们对别人的利益不感兴趣；我们只对权力感兴趣。我们对财富或奢华、长寿或幸福不感兴趣，只对权力、纯粹的权力感兴趣。纯粹的权力意味着什么，你很快会理解的。我们不同于过去所有的寡头政治，我们知道我们在做什么。而所有其他的人，甚至那些与我们相似的人，都是胆小鬼和伪君子。德国纳粹和俄国共产党人在方法上与我们相仿，但他们从不敢于承认他们的行为动机。他们假装，也许他们真的相信，他们夺取权力是迫不得已的、暂时的，不久的将来，他们将建设一个乐园，人类将获得自由和平等。我们与此不同。我们知道，没有人获得权力后会愿意放弃权力。权力不是一种手段，它就是目的。人们不是为了保卫革命而进行独裁；人们进行革命是为了建立独裁。迫害的目的就是迫害。酷刑的目的就是酷刑。权力的目的就是权力。现在，你开始理解我的话了吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Winston was struck, as he had been struck before, by the tiredness of O'Brien's face. It was strong and fleshy and brutal, it was full of intelligence and a sort of controlled passion before which he felt himself helpless; but it was tired. There were pouches under the eyes, the skin sagged from the cheekbones. O'Brien leaned over him, deliberately bringing the worn face nearer.</div>

<div class="line_en">"We are the priests of power," he said. "God is power. But at present power is only a word so far as you are concerned. It is time for you to gather some idea of what power means. The first thing you must realize is that power is collective. The individual only has power in so far as he ceases to be an individual. You know the Party slogan: 'Freedom is Slavery'. Has it ever occurred to you that it is reversible? Slavery is freedom. Alone -- free -- the human being is always defeated. It must be so, because every human being is doomed to die, which is the greatest of all failures. But if he can make complete, utter submission, if he can escape from his identity, if he can merge himself in the Party so that he IS the Party, then he is all-powerful and immortal. The second thing for you to realize is that power is power over human beings. Over the body -- but, above all, over the mind. Power over matter -- external reality, as you would call it -- is not important. Already our control over matter is absolute."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们是权力的祭司，”他说，“上帝就是权力。但如今，权力只是你关注的一个词。现在是你把握权力的意义的时候了。首先，你必须意识到，权力是集体性的。至今为止，个人只有当他不再是个人的时候才有权力。你知道党的口号：‘自由即奴隶。’你想过把它倒过来吗？奴隶即自由。人单独，即自由的时候，注定会被打败。之所以如此，是因为每个人注定会死去，这是最大的失败。但如果他能完全彻底地顺从，如果他能逃离他的身份，如果他能将自己与党融为一体，他就是党，那么他就是无所不能并不朽的了。其次，你要意识到，权力是对人的权力。对肉体，更是对心灵的权力。对物质——外部现实，如你所说——并不重要。我们已经对物质行使绝对的权力。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Collective solipsism, if you like. But that is a different thing: in fact, the opposite thing. All this is a digression," he added in a different tone. "The real power, the power we have to fight for night and day, is not power over things, but over men."

<div class="line_en">"Exactly. By making him suffer. Obedience is not enough. Unless he is suffering, how can you be sure that he is obeying your will and not his own? Power is in inflicting pain and humiliation. Power is in tearing human minds to pieces and putting them together again in new shapes of your own choosing. Do you begin to see, then, what kind of world we are creating? It is the exact opposite of the stupid hedonistic Utopias that the old reformers imagined. A world of fear and treachery and torment, a world of trampling and being trampled upon, a world which will grow not less but MORE merciless as it refines itself. Progress in our world will be progress towards more pain. The old civilizations claimed that they were founded on love or justice. Ours is founded upon hatred. In our world there will be no emotions except fear, rage, triumph, and self-abasement. Everything else we shall destroy -- everything. Already we are breaking down the habits of thought which have survived from before the Revolution. We have cut the links between child and parent, and between man and man, and between man and woman. No one dares trust a wife or a child or a friend any longer. But in the future there will be no wives and no friends. Children will be taken from their mothers at birth, as one takes eggs from a hen. The sex instinct will be eradicated. Procreation will be an annual formality like the renewal of a ration card. We shall abolish the orgasm. Our neurologists are at work upon it now. There will be no loyalty, except loyalty towards the Party. There will be no love, except the love of Big Brother. There will be no laughter, except the laugh of triumph over a defeated enemy. There will be no art, no literature, no science. When we are omnipotent we shall have no more need of science. There will be no distinction between beauty and ugliness. There will be no curiosity, no enjoyment of the process of life. All competing pleasures will be destroyed.

The heretic, the enemy of society, will always be there, so that he can be defeated and humiliated over again. Everything that you have undergone since you have been in our hands -- all that will continue, and worse. The espionage, the betrayals, the arrests, the tortures, the executions, the disappearances will never cease. It will be a world of terror as much as a world of triumph. The more the Party is powerful, the less it will be tolerant: the weaker the opposition, the tighter the despotism. Goldstein and his heresies will live for ever. Every day, at every moment, they will be defeated, discredited, ridiculed, spat upon and yet they will always survive. This drama that I have played out with you during seven years will be played out over and over again generation after generation, always in subtler forms. Always we shall have the heretic here at our mercy, screaming with pain, broken up, contemptible -- and in the end utterly penitent, saved from himself, crawling to our feet of his own accord. That is the world that we are preparing, Winston. A world of victory after victory, triumph after triumph after triumph: an endless pressing, pressing, pressing upon the nerve of power. You are beginning, I can see, to realize what that world will be like. But in the end you will do more than understand it. You will accept it, welcome it, become part of it."</div>

Its actual appearance was frightening, and not merely the fact that he knew it to be himself. He moved closer to the glass. The creature's face seemed to be protruded, because of its bent carriage. A forlorn, jailbird's face with a nobby forehead running back into a bald scalp, a crooked nose, and battered-looking cheekbones above which his eyes were fierce and watchful. The cheeks were seamed, the mouth had a drawn-in look. Certainly it was his own face, but it seemed to him that it had changed more than he had changed inside. The emotions it registered would be different from the ones he felt. He had gone partially bald. For the first moment he had thought that he had gone grey as well, but it was only the scalp that was grey. Except for his hands and a circle of his face, his body was grey all over with ancient, ingrained dirt. Here and there under the dirt there were the red scars of wounds, and near the ankle the varicose ulcer was an inflamed mass with flakes of skin peeling off it. But the truly frightening thing was the emaciation of his body. The barrel of the ribs was as narrow as that of a skeleton: the legs had shrunk so that the knees were thicker than the thighs. He saw now what O'Brien had meant about seeing the side view. The curvature of the spine was astonishing. The thin shoulders were hunched forward so as to make a cavity of the chest, the scraggy neck seemed to be bending double under the weight of the skull. At a guess he would have said that it was the body of a man of sixty, suffering from some malignant disease.</div>
