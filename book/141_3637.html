<div class="line_en">An hour after, the Henrietta passed the lighthouse which marks the entrance of the Hudson, turned the point of Sandy Hook, and put to sea. During the day she skirted Long Island, passed Fire Island, and directed her course rapidly eastward.</div>

<div class="line_en">At noon the next day, a man mounted the bridge to ascertain the vessel's position. It might be thought that this was Captain Speedy. Not the least in the world. It was Phileas Fogg, Esquire. As for Captain Speedy, he was shut up in his cabin under lock and key, and was uttering loud cries, which signified an anger at once pardonable and excessive.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天是12月13号，中午，只见一个人走上舰桥测定方位。人们猜想那准是船长斯皮蒂。可是一点也没有猜对。那是斐利亚·福克。至于船长斯皮蒂呢，他已经被十分稳妥地关在船长室里了，门外还上了锁。他在里头大喊大叫，几乎都气得发疯了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What had happened was very simple. Phileas Fogg wished to go to Liverpool, but the captain would not carry him there. Then Phileas Fogg had taken passage for Bordeaux, and, during the thirty hours he had been on board, had so shrewdly managed with his banknotes that the sailors and stokers, who were only an occasional crew, and were not on the best terms with the captain, went over to him in a body. This was why Phileas Fogg was in command instead of Captain Speedy; why the captain was a prisoner in his cabin; and why, in short, the Henrietta was directing her course towards Liverpool. It was very clear, to see Mr. Fogg manage the craft, that he had been a sailor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="事情的经过很简单。斐利亚·福克要到利物浦，船长就是不肯去，于是斐利亚·福克就答应去波尔多。上船之后，福克在这三十个小时当中，很成功地发动了他的英镑攻势。船上的船员从水手到司炉，都难免有点营私舞弊，何况他们本来跟船长就不大对劲，现在自然都站到福克一边了。这就说明了为什么斐利亚·福克会站在船长斯皮蒂的位子上发号施令，为什么斯皮蒂会被关在船长室里，以及为什么亨利埃塔号会开往利物浦。不过从福克先生在船上的操作来看，显然可以看出他过去一定当过海员。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">How the adventure ended will be seen anon. Aouda was anxious, though she said nothing. As for Passepartout, he thought Mr. Fogg's manoeuvre simply glorious. The captain had said "between eleven and twelve knots," and the Henrietta confirmed his prediction.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这事的结局如何，留待后面再说。这时，艾娥达夫人虽然一句话没说，但心里少不了要替福克先生担忧；费克斯呢，他早就给搞得莫名其妙了，至于路路通，他倒觉得这件事办得太漂亮了。船长斯皮蒂说过，亨利埃塔号的时速是十一至十二海里，实际上也确实保持了这样的平均速度。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">If, then -- for there were "ifs" still -- the sea did not become too boisterous, if the wind did not veer round to the east, if no accident happened to the boat or its machinery, the Henrietta might cross the three thousand miles from New York to Liverpool in the nine days, between the 12th and the 21st of December. It is true that, once arrived, the affair on board the Henrietta, added to that of the Bank of England, might create more difficulties for Mr. Fogg than he imagined or could desire.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果——天晓得！现在还有这么多的“如果”！——如果气候不太坏，如果不起东风，如果船不出毛病，机器不发生障碍，亨利埃塔号从12月12号到21号这九天以内准能走完从纽约到利物浦的这三千海里的路程。不过，说老实话，一旦到了英国，要是把福克强夺亨利埃塔号这案件和英国银行失窃的案件加到一块儿，那准会叫这位绅士狼狈不堪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">During the first days, they went along smoothly enough. The sea was not very unpropitious, the wind seemed stationary in the north-east, the sails were hoisted, and the Henrietta ploughed across the waves like a real trans-Atlantic steamer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最初几天，亨利埃塔号航行得非常顺利。海上风浪不大，一直是刮着西南风，亨利埃塔号张起群帆，有了前后樯两张大帆推动，它走得简直跟一艘横渡大西洋的客船一模一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Passepartout was delighted. His master's last exploit, the consequences of which he ignored, enchanted him. Never had the crew seen so jolly and dexterous a fellow. He formed warm friendships with the sailors, and amazed them with his acrobatic feats. He thought they managed the vessel like gentlemen, and that the stokers fired up like heroes. His loquacious good-humour infected everyone. He had forgotten the past, its vexations and delays. He only thought of the end, so nearly accomplished; and sometimes he boiled over with impatience, as if heated by the furnaces of the Henrietta. Often, also, the worthy fellow revolved around Fix, looking at him with a keen, distrustful eye; but he did not speak to him, for their old intimacy no longer existed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="路路通高兴死了。他主人的这条妙计简直使他太高兴了。至于后果如何，他根本连想都没想。船员们从来也没见过一个象路路通这样兴高采烈、活蹦乱跳的小伙子。他对水手们无限殷勤，他那翻跟斗的绝技更使他们吃惊。他一个劲儿跟他们说好话，请他们喝好酒。为了不辜负路路通的好意，水手们干起活来都象绅士一样非常认真。司炉们烧起火来象英雄一样不顾疲劳。路路通的这种乐观情绪使大家都受到感染。他这时已经把过去那些烦恼和危险都忘了。他一心只想到那个就要到达的目的地。有时他也会急不可耐，仿佛亨利埃塔号的锅炉就在他心里燃烧似的。这个好小伙子有时候也常在费克斯身旁走动，他看着费克斯，好象他有一肚子话想跟对方谈！但是他没有开腔，因为在这两个老朋友之间现在已经毫无交情可言了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As for Captain Speedy, he continued to howl and growl in his cabin; and Passepartout, whose duty it was to carry him his meals, courageous as he was, took the greatest precautions. Mr. Fogg did not seem even to know that there was a captain on board.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="至于船长斯皮蒂，他还在他的船长室里发他的脾气；路路通负责照料船长的饮食，尽管这小伙子性格倔强，但是他对于这件差事还是做得小心翼翼的。再看看福克先生吧，他好象想也没想过在这条船上还有一个船长。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Fix, it must be confessed, understood nothing of what was going on. The conquest of the Henrietta, the bribery of the crew, Fogg managing the boat like a skilled seaman, amazed and confused him. He did not know what to think. For, after all, a man who began by stealing fifty-five thousand pounds might end by stealing a vessel; and Fix was not unnaturally inclined to conclude that the Henrietta under Fogg's command, was not going to Liverpool at all, but to some part of the world where the robber, turned into a pirate, would quietly put himself in safety. The conjecture was at least a plausible one, and the detective began to seriously regret that he had embarked on the affair.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而费克斯呢，说真的他现在简直是给弄得莫名其妙了！亨利埃塔号被强夺了，船上的船员被收买了，这个福克在船上干起活来完全象是个老水手。这一连串的怪事弄得他如堕五里雾中。他真不知道该怎么想才好！但是，不论如何，这位绅士既然过去能盗窃五万五千英镑，今天他当然也能抢夺一条船。因此费克斯很自然地会认为福克掌握了这条亨利埃塔号也绝不会去利物浦，而只会去一个什么地方，到了那里，这个贼摇身一变就成了海盗，永远逍遥法外！应当承认，他这样猜测确实是很合情理的，侦探现在感到万分悔恨，悔不该上了福克的贼船。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On the 13th they passed the edge of the Banks of Newfoundland, a dangerous locality; during the winter, especially, there are frequent fogs and heavy gales of wind. Ever since the evening before the barometer, suddenly falling, had indicated an approaching change in the atmosphere; and during the night the temperature varied, the cold became sharper, and the wind veered to the south-east.</div>

<div class="line_en">This was a misfortune. Mr. Fogg, in order not to deviate from his course, furled his sails and increased the force of the steam; but the vessel's speed slackened, owing to the state of the sea, the long waves of which broke against the stern. She pitched violently, and this retarded her progress. The breeze little by little swelled into a tempest, and it was to be feared that the Henrietta might not be able to maintain herself upright on the waves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这真是“急行船偏遇打头风”。福克先生为了使船不离开原来的航线，只好卷起船帆，加大马力前进。由于海上气候的变化，无论如何，航行的速度总是减低了。滚滚的巨浪不停地冲击着船头，船身随着风浪前后颠簸，大大影响了前进的速度。海风越刮越凶，就要变成一阵飓风，眼看亨利埃塔号就会被海浪打得站不住了。可是，如果必须开船逃避飓风，那一切可能发生的不幸都会无法预测。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The wind, however, did not grow as boisterous as might have been feared; it was not one of those tempests which burst, and rush on with a speed of ninety miles an hour. It continued fresh, but, unhappily, it remained obstinately in the south-east, rendering the sails useless.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其实，大风并没有象人们预料的那样凶猛。这次刮的并不是那种时速高达九十英里的飓风。它只是一种强风。但是很糟糕的是风向不变，一直是从东南往西北刮，船帆一点也使不上。从眼前和今后的情况看来，都说明船上的机器极需要船帆的帮助！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Passepartout's visage darkened with the skies, and for two days the poor fellow experienced constant fright. But Phileas Fogg was a bold mariner, and knew how to maintain headway against the sea; and he kept on his course, without even decreasing his steam. The Henrietta, when she could not rise upon the waves, crossed them, swamping her deck, but passing safely. Sometinies the screw rose out of the water, beating its protruding end, when a mountain of water raised the stern above the waves; but the craft always kept straight ahead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="路路通的脸色随着天气的阴暗也变得非常忧郁了。两天以来，这个诚实的小伙子一直是在提心吊胆。但是，斐利亚·福克真不愧是一位勇敢的海员，他善于跟大海搏斗，他一直指挥着船前进，甚至连速度也不肯降低。每当大浪卷来，亨利埃塔号无力冲上浪峰时，就从巨浪下穿行，整个甲板都受到了海水的冲洗，但是船却照样过去了。有时，巨浪象大山一样将船尾高高抬起，这时，螺旋推进器就露出了水面，立刻发生剧烈的空转，但是船却照样一直不停地前进。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The 16th of December was the seventy-fifth day since Phileas Fogg's departure from London, and the Henrietta had not yet been seriously delayed. Half of the voyage was almost accomplished, and the worst localities had been passed. In summer, success would have been well-nigh certain. In winter, they were at the mercy of the bad season. Passepartout said nothing; but he cherished hope in secret, and comforted himself with the reflection that, if the wind failed them, they might still count on the steam.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="12月16号，这是福克先生离开伦敦的第七十五天。总的说来亨利埃塔号还没有发生令人忧虑的耽搁。一半的航程已经差不多走完了，那些最难航行的地方也已经过去了。现在如果是夏天，那就可以说成功在望了，但现在是冬天，那还得听凭这个坏季节摆布。路路通一句话不说，但他心里却觉得很有希望。他认为即使没有顺风，还可以依靠机器。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On this day the engineer came on deck, went up to Mr. Fogg, and began to speak earnestly with him. Without knowing why it was a presentiment, perhaps Passepartout became vaguely uneasy. He would have given one of his ears to hear with the other what the engineer was saying. He finally managed to catch a few words, and was sure he heard his master say, "You are certain of what you tell me?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是，就在这一天，船上的机务员到甲板上来找福克先生，他很激动地跟福克先生谈了半天。路路通不知道为什么，很可能是由于一种预感，使他觉得有点莫名其妙的担心。他真恨不得把两只耳朵的听力都集中到一个耳朵上，好听听他们谈些什么。他到底还是听见了几句，其中有这么一句，那是他主人说的：“你刚才说的这些，你都拿得准吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Certain, sir," replied the engineer. "You must remember that, since we started, we have kept up hot fires in all our furnaces, and, though we had coal enough to go on short steam from New York to Bordeaux, we haven't enough to go with all steam from New York to Liverpool."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然拿得准了，先生，”机务员回答说，“您别忘了，我们从开船到现在所有的锅炉都是烧满火。如果说我们的煤烧小火足够从纽约开到波尔多，那么我们就没有足够的煤烧大火从纽约开到利物浦！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Passepartout was on the point of vigorously resenting the epithet, the reason of which he could not for the life of him comprehend; but he reflected that the unfortunate Fix was probably very much disappointed and humiliated in his self-esteem, after having so awkwardly followed a false scent around the world, and refrained.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="路路通当时就要认真地质问费克斯“傻瓜”是什么意思，他确实不知道费克斯这句话是指什么说的，但是，他心里想，这个倒霉蛋费克斯现在一定是很懊丧，他愚笨地盯着一个自己假想的小偷在地球上兜了一圈，临了还得自己认错，这一定使他的自尊心受到了很大的打击。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Passepartout understood it all; he was seized with mortal anxiety. The coal was giving out! "Ah, if my master can get over that," muttered he, "he'll be a famous man!" He could not help imparting to Fix what he had overheard.</div>

<div class="line_en">The railings, fittings, the greater part of the deck, and top sides disappeared on the 20th, and the Henrietta was now only a flat hulk. But on this day they sighted the Irish coast and Fastnet Light. By ten in the evening they were passing Queenstown. Phileas Fogg had only twenty-four hours more in which to get to London; that length of time was necessary to reach Liverpool, with all steam on. And the steam was about to give out altogether!</div>

<div class="line_en">It was necessary to have dry wood to keep the steam up to the adequate pressure, and on that day the poop, cabins, bunks, and the spare deck were sacrificed. On the next day, the 19th of December, the masts, rafts, and spars were burned; the crew worked lustily, keeping up the fires. Passepartout hewed, cut, and sawed away with all his might. There was a perfect rage for demolition.</div>
