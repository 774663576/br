<div class="line_en">He could hear the warrior's voice below him, appealing to him to climb more slowly, but Edwin ignored it. Wistan was too slow, and in general appeared not to appreciate the urgency of their situation. When they were still not halfway up the cliff, he had asked Edwin: "Can that be a hawk just flew past us, young comrade?" What did it matter what it was? His fever had made the warrior soft, both in mind and body.</div>

<div class="line_en">Only a little further to climb, then he at least would be over the edge and standing on firm ground. He could then run -- how he longed to run!-- but to where? Their destination had, for the moment, drifted beyond his recall. What was more, there had been something important to tell the warrior: he had been deceiving Wistan about something, and now it was almost time to confess. When they had started their climb, leaving the exhausted mare tied to a shrub beside the mountain path, he had resolved to make a clean breast of it once they reached the top. Yet now he was almost there, his mind held nothing but confused wisps.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="再爬一会儿就到了，至少他就翻过了山崖，能站到结实的地面上。那他就能奔跑了——他多么渴望奔跑啊！——可朝哪儿跑呢？这一下子，他们的目的地好像从脑海中飘走了一样。何况，还有更重要的事情要跟维斯坦说：他欺骗过维斯坦，现在差不多是坦白的时候了。他们把那匹筋疲力尽的母马系在山路旁一株小灌木上，然后开始爬山，那时候他就下定了决心，等到了山顶，就把一切和盘托出。可现在他就快到那儿了，脑海中却空空如也，思绪纷乱，像一团团烟雾。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Though out of breath from the climb, Edwin pushed himself forward into a run. For those trees, surely, were where he had to be, and once there he would remember everything. Wistan's voice was shouting again somewhere behind him -- the warrior must finally have arrived at the top -- but Edwin, not glancing back, ran all the faster. He would leave his confession until those trees. Within their shelter, he would be able to remember more clearly, and they could talk without the wind's howl.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃德温气喘吁吁，但还是发力向前跑去。那片树林，肯定就是他该去的地方，一到那儿，他什么都会记起来。维斯坦的声音又在身后什么地方叫喊——武士肯定也爬上了崖顶——但埃德温不回头，跑得更快了。他要到那树林之中才开始坦白。在大树的遮掩之下，他会记得更清楚，两人谈话时也不会有呼啸的大风。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The ground came up to meet him and knocked the breath from him. It happened so unexpectedly he was obliged to lie there a moment, quite dazed, and when he tried to spring back to his feet something soft but forceful kept him down. He realised then that Wistan's knee was on his back, and that his hands were being tied behind him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大地突然立起，迎面而来，撞得他差点儿闭过气去。这来得太突然，他头晕目眩，只能在地上躺一会儿，等他想跳起来的时候，背后却有个柔软而有力的东西摁住了他。这时他意识到，维斯坦用膝盖抵住了自己的后背，正在捆绑自己的双手。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He clambered over the last rocks and pulled himself up over the precipice. The land before him was bare and wind-scarred, rising gradually towards the pale peaks on the horizon. Nearby were patches of heather and mountain grass, but nothing taller than a man's ankle. Yet strangely, there in the mid-distance, was what appeared to be a wood, its lush trees standing calmly against the battling wind. Had some god, on a whim, picked up in his fingers a section of rich forest and set it down in this inhospitable terrain?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他攀过最后几块岩石，起身站在悬崖的边缘。眼前的土地空阔荒凉，缓缓向上与地平线上灰白的山峰相连。附近有一块块的石楠地和野草地，不过成人的脚踝那么高。奇怪的是，在不远不近的某个地方，似乎有一片树林，树木葱翠，在大风中静静地立着。难道是某位神仙一时兴起，从密林中抓出一小撮来，放在这块荒凉的土地上？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He pulled and pulled, occasionally managing several steps at a run before the rope jerked him to a halt. A voice was in his ears -- a familiar voice -- half-singing, half-chanting a children's rhyme, one he knew well from when he was younger. It was comforting and disturbing in equal measure and he found if he chanted along while tugging on the rope, the voice lost something of its unsettling edge. So he chanted, at first under his breath, then with less inhibition into the wind: "Who knocked over the cup of ale? Who cut off the dragon's tail? Who left the snake inside the pail? 'Twas your Cousin Adny." There were further lines he did not remember, but he was surprised to find that he had but to chant along with the voice and the words would come out correctly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他走着、走着，偶尔一口气能迈出好几步，然后绳子就把他拉停了。他耳朵里有一个声音——熟悉的声音——半是歌唱，半是吟诵，那是一首童谣，他从小就很熟悉。这声音令人又舒心又担忧，而且他发现，如果一边拽绳子，一边跟着唱，那声音就不再那么令人心烦。于是他就跟着唱，一开始声音很低，然后他嗓子逐渐放开，迎风而歌：“谁打翻了麦酒杯？谁砍断了龙的尾？谁把蛇留在桶内？是你的表兄艾德尼？”还有一些词他记不起来了，但让他惊讶的是，他只要跟着那声音吟唱，正确的歌词就会自动出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The trees were near now and the warrior tugged him back again. "Slowly, young comrade. We need more than courage to enter this strange grove. Look there. Pine trees at this height's no mystery, but aren't those oaks and elms beside them?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="树林很近了，武士又一次把他拉住。“慢点儿啊，小战友。进入这片奇怪的树林，光靠勇气是不够的。你看那边。这么高的山上有松树倒也没什么，但是旁边的难道不是橡树和榆树吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They entered the wood and the ground changed beneath them: there was soft moss, nettles, even ferns. The leaves above them were dense enough to form a ceiling, so that for a while they wandered in a grey half-light. Yet this was no forest, for soon they could see before them a clearing with its circle of open sky above it. The thought came to Edwin that if this was indeed the work of a god, the intention must have been to conceal with these trees whatever lay ahead. He pulled angrily at the rope, saying:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们进了树林，脚下的地变了：有柔软的苔藓、荨麻甚至蕨类。头顶树叶浓密，像屋顶一样，所以他们在半明半暗之中走了一会儿。但是，这却不是真正意义上的森林，因为不久他们就看到一处空地，上方露出圆形的天空来。埃德温想，如果这真是某位神祇的杰作，那么他肯定是想用树来隐藏前方的什么东西。他愤怒地拉着绳子，说道：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“磨蹭什么呢，武士？难道你是害怕了吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

Several times he lost his balance, for trussed as he was he had no hand to put out to steady himself.

<div class="line_cn" title="这次，维斯坦放开了他，埃德温从蓟草和交错的树根上跑过去。他绊了几跤，因为他被绑着，不能伸出手去保持平衡。不过，到达空地的时候，他并没有受伤。他在空地边缘停下脚步，看着眼前的景象。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The patch of sky above the pond cast a strange light down on the ogre, and Edwin stared at it for a while, almost expecting it to return to life, bringing up a ghastly and flushed face. Then, with a start, he realised there was a second creature in an identical posture on the far right-hand edge of the pond. And there!-- yet a third, not far before him, on the near bank, half-concealed by the ferns.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="池塘上方那块天空，将奇怪的光射在那食人兽身上，埃德温盯着它看了一会儿，简直觉得这食人兽会活过来，突然抬起一张可怖、涨红的脸。然后，他吃惊地发现，池塘右手边远处，还有一头野兽，姿势一模一样。那儿还有！——第三只，就在他面前不远，在这边的岸上，身体被蕨类遮住了一部分。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At the centre of the clearing was a pond. It was frozen over, so a man -- were he brave or foolish enough -- might cross it in twenty or so strides. The smoothness of the ice's surface was interrupted only near the far side, where the hollowed-out trunk of a dead tree burst up through it. Along the bank, not far from the ruined tree, a large ogre was crouching down on its knees and elbows at the water's very edge, its head completely submerged. Perhaps the creature had been drinking -- or searching for something beneath the surface -- and had been overtaken by the sudden freeze. To a careless observer, the ogre might have been a headless corpse, decapitated as it crawled to quench its thirst.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="空地中央有个池塘。水面冻住了，如果有人很勇敢或很愚蠢的话，可以在上面走，二十来步就能到对岸。冰面平滑如镜，只在靠近对岸的地方，一棵死树树干中空，从上面冒出来。岸上，离枯树不远的地方，有一只巨大的食人兽，手肘和膝盖着地，蹲在水边，脑袋全部没在水中。也许这野兽正在喝水——或者在找水面下方的什么东西——后来水突然结冰，把他冻在里面了。如果不注意看，那食人兽像具无头尸体，爬到池塘边喝水的时候被人砍掉了脑袋。">查看中文翻译</div>
