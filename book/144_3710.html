<div class="line_en">It was as important to her as it was to the Studio. Messalina was her first truly original script; her other work had been adaptations of novels, rewrites or doctoring of other scripts, or collaborations.</div>

<div class="line_en">Also, she was a coproducer of Messalina, which gave her a power she had never previously enjoyed. Plus an adjusted gross of the profits. She would see some really big money. And she could then take the next step, to producer-writer. She was perhaps the only person west of the Mississippi who did not want to direct; that required a cruelty in human relationships that she could not tolerate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不仅如此，她还是《梅莎琳娜》的联合制片人，她从没有过这么大的权力。而且还有票房分成。这回她可真正能见识到什么才叫一大笔钱了。而且，以后她还可以再接再厉，成为编剧兼制片人。整个密西西比河西岸，估计也只有她不想当导演。因为当导演就得六亲不认，她可受不了这一点。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Claudia's relationship with Athena was a true intimacy, not the professional friendship of fellow workers in the movie industry. Athena would know how much the picture meant to her career. Athena was intelligent. What really puzzled Claudia was Athena's fear of Boz Skannet. Athena had never been afraid of anything or anyone.</div>

<div class="line_en">Because she was witty and vivacious and talented, she soon made many friends in Los Angeles. She enrolled in a movie-script writing course at UCLA and met a young man whose father was a famous plastic surgeon. She and the young man became lovers, and he was bewitched by her body and intelligence. He revised her status from comradely bed partner to "serious relationship." He brought her home to his family for dinner. His father, the plastic surgeon, was enchanted by her. After dinner the surgeon put his hands around her face. "It's unfair that a girl like you is not as pretty as you should be," he said. "Don't take offense, it's a perfectly natural misfortune. And it's my business. I can fix it if you let me."</div>

<div class="line_en">"All the good in the world," the surgeon said. "And when I get through with you, you'll be too good for my son. You are a sweet and intelligent girl, but looks are power. Do you really want to spend the rest of your life standing around while men flock to good-looking women who have not one tenth of your intelligence? And you have to sit around like a dummy because your nose is too thick and you have a chin like a Mafia hood." As he said this he patted her cheek and said gently, "It won't take much doing.

Just think of it as a professional move, not some male-female thing. Though of course it is." He saw that she still hesitated. "I'll do it without a fee," he said. "I'll do it for you and for my son. Even though I fear that once you're as pretty as I think you will be, he will lose a girlfriend."</div>

<div class="line_en">The professional results were magical. Claudia, despite her youth, obtained a personal interview with Melo Stuart, who became her agent. He got her minor rewrites on scripts and invited her to parties where she met producers, directors, and stars. They were enchanted by her. In the next five years, despite her youth, she was ranked as a Class A writer on A films. In her personal life the effect was equally magical. The surgeon had been right. His son could not meet the competition. Claudia had a string of sexual conquests -- some really submissions -- that would have made a film star proud.</div>

<div class="line_en">Claudia loved the movie business. She loved working with other writers, she loved arguing with producers, cajoling directors: the first with how to save money doing the script a certain way, the other with how a script could be done on the highest artistic level. She was in awe of actresses and actors, how they were attuned to her words, making them sound better and more touching. She loved the magic of the set, which most people found boring, she enjoyed the camaraderie of the crew and had no compunction about screwing "below the line." She was thrilled with the whole process of opening a movie and watching its success or failure. She believed in movies as a great art form, and when called in to do a rewrite, she fancied herself a healer and did not look to make changes solely to get screen credit. At the age of twenty-five she had an enormous reputation and friendships with many stars, the closest one being with Athena Aquitane.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克劳迪娅喜欢电影行业。她喜欢跟其他作家合作，喜欢挑战制片人，告诉他怎么拍一个场景才最省钱，她劝说导演拍出艺术水准。男女演员都佩服她写出的对话更契合他们，让他们演得更出色、表演更真挚。大部分人都觉得片场无聊，她却喜欢片场的魔力，她喜欢与剧组打成一片，从来不会担心“有失身份”。看着一部电影开机，最后无论成功或失败，她都感到兴奋无比。她信仰电影这种伟大的艺术形式。她改编剧本的时候，总是把自己想象成一位医者，从不为了在演职员表上留个名而应付差事。二十五岁，她已经有点名气了，跟许多明星都成了好朋友，其中最亲密的就要数安提娜·阿奎坦内了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What was more of a surprise to her was her ebullient sexuality. Going to bed with a man she liked was as natural to her as any act of friendship. She never did it for advantage, she was too talented; she sometimes joked that stars slept with her to get her next script.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她情欲旺盛到出乎自己的预料。在她看来，跟喜欢的男人上床，这是很自然的事情，跟其他形式的友谊没什么区别。她才华横溢，用不着出卖色相；相反，有时候她开玩笑说，男明星们为了出演她的下一部剧本，才会跟她上床。">查看中文翻译</div>

Claudia refused good-humoredly and said, "I thought there was no fee."</div>

<div class="line_en">In the bedroom of the downstairs apartment of the Beverly Hills Hotel bungalow, she observed with amusement that he was shy. Claudia rejected any coyness, she helped him undress, and while he folded his clothes over a stuffed chair, she got herself naked, gave him a hug, and followed him beneath the bedcovers. Marrion tried to joke, "When King Solomon was dying, they sent virgins to his bed to keep him warm."</div>

<div class="line_en">Eli Marrion had given up sex the last few years. It was more work than fun, since he was nearly impotent. When he invited Claudia to come with him to the Beverly Hills bungalow owned by LoddStone, he assumed that she accepted because of his power. He had no idea that it was her sexual curiosity. What would it be like to go to bed with so powerful a man who was so old? That would not have been enough, but in addition she found Marrion attractive despite his age. His gorilla-like face could actually turn handsome when he smiled, which he did when he told her that everyone called him Eli, including his grandchildren. His intelligence and his natural charm intrigued her because she had heard about his ruthlessness. It would be interesting.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Okay, Eli," Claudia said. "Now I'll tell you in detail why your movie is lousy from a money standpoint and an artistic one." Still gently fondling him, she delivered a penetrating analysis of the script, the director, and the actors. "It's not that it's just a bad movie," Claudia said. "It's an unwatchable movie. Because it has no story sense and so all you have is some fucking director giving you a slide show of what he thinks is a story. And the actors just go through the motions because they know it's bullshit."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，伊莱，”克劳迪娅说，“那我就说说，为什么你的电影无论从票房角度还是从艺术角度都很烂。”她一边爱抚他，一边针对剧本、导演和演员作了一番单刀直入的分析。“不只是烂，”克劳迪娅说，“根本没法看。完全不能算是个故事，只是一个破导演拍了一堆幻灯片，以为这就是故事。演员只是走走过场，因为他们都知道，这片子根本就是扯淡。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, then, I'm not going to help you much," Claudia said. She kissed him and fondled him. His lips were pleasantly warm. His skin had a dryness and waxiness that was not distasteful. She had been surprised by his tinyness when he shed his clothing and shoes, and she considered for a moment what a three-thousand-dollar suit could do for a man in power. But his smallness with the huge head was also endearing. She was not at all put off. After ten minutes of fondling and kissing (the great Marrion kissed with the innocence of a child), they both realized that he was now fully impotent. Marrion thought, This is the last time I will ever be in bed with a woman. He sighed and relaxed as she cradled him in her arms.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那我可帮不了你了。”克劳迪娅说。她亲吻他、爱抚他。他的嘴唇很温暖、很舒服。他的皮肤光滑干燥，并不让人反感。当他脱下衣服和鞋子的时候，她感到十分惊讶：原来他竟然这么瘦小，三千美元的西装果然没有白花钱。他身材虽小，脑袋却大，让人忍俊不禁，她完全没有抗拒感。可互相爱抚和亲吻了十分钟之后（马林这样的大人物，接起吻来却像个小孩子），两个人终于意识到，他已彻底不能人道。马林想，这是我最后一次跟女人上床了。她把他抱在臂弯里，他叹了口气，反倒释然了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Marrion listened to her with a benign smile. He felt very comfortable. He realized that an essential part of his life was over, finished by an approaching death. That he would never again make love to a woman, or even try, was not humiliating. He knew Claudia would not talk about this night, and if she did, what would it matter?

Then this latest book had broken through and become an enormous bestseller and was now being made into a movie by LoddStone Studios. Vail had written the script, and now Bobby Bantz and Skippy Deere were telling him how wonderful it was. And to Claudia's astonishment, Vail was swallowing their praise like some starlet headed for the casting couch. What the hell did Vail think Claudia was doing at this meeting?

His articles in magazines addressed sensitive national issues and were always politically incorrect, but ironically this angered both sides. He jeered at the American democratic process; writing about feminism, he declared that women would always be subjugated by men until they became physically equal, and advised feminists to set up paramilitary training groups. On racial problems, he wrote an essay on language in which he insisted the blacks should call themselves "coloreds" because "black" was used in so many pejorative ways -- black thoughts, black as hell, black countenance -- and that the word always had a negative connotation except when used in the phrase "simple black dress."</div>

Also, he was as greedy as a monkey, clutching her naked body as if she were a fruit hanging from a tree. His appetite amused Claudia. She relished the inherent comedy of sex. And she loved that he was famous all over the world, that she had seen him on TV and thought him a little pompous on literature, the grievous moral state of the world, so dignified clutching the pipe he rarely smoked and looking very professorial in his tweed jacket with sewn-leather elbow patches.

<div class="line_en">Claudia De Lena wrote her original screenplay of Messalina as a witty propaganda piece for feminism. But after five years in the movie business she knew that any message had to be coated with more basic ingredients, such as greed, sex, murder, and a belief in humanity. She knew she had to write great parts not only for her first choice, Athena Aquitane, but for at least three other female stars in lesser roles. Good female roles were so scarce that the script would attract top-name stars. And then, absolutely essential, the great villain -- charming, ruthless, handsome, and witty.

In the Palisades Park that separated Ocean Avenue from Pacific Coast High-way, she saw the homeless men and women of Santa Monica gathering for their Sunday brunch.

Claudia always took this route to watch them, to remind herself of that other world where people did not have Mercedeses and swimming pools and did not shop on Rodeo Drive. In the early years she often volunteered to serve food in the park, now she just sent a check to the church that fed them. It had become too painful to go from one world to the other, it blunted her desire to succeed. She could not avoid watching the men, so shabbily dressed, their lives in ruins, yet some of them curiously dignified.

<div class="line_en">It is so rare to find a human being so beautiful in physical form and so virtuous in other parts of her nature. And so he thought of Thena. Everybody had called her Thena in those days of her girlhood.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="同时拥有美丽的外表和善良的品质的人实在是少见。他想起了安提娜还是花季少女的时候，大家都叫她提娜。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">How did she dare to be so perfect? How did she dare to be so demanding of love? How did she dare to make so many people love her? Didn't she know how dangerous that would be?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她怎么敢如此完美？她怎么敢如此苛求爱情？她怎么敢让那么多人倾心于她？难道她不知道这有多危险吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Boz Skannet took off his slacks and T-shirt and stretched out on his blanket, staring over the sand and the blue sheet of the Pacific Ocean beyond. The warmth of the sun made him drowsy. He thought of Athena.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="博兹·斯堪尼特脱下T恤和长裤，铺开毯子。他出神地看着沙滩和蔚蓝的太平洋。温暖的阳光让他昏昏欲睡。他又想起了安提娜。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In college he had heard a professor lecturing on Emerson's essays and quoting, "Beauty is its own excuse." Was it Emerson, was it Beauty? But he had thought of Athena.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="上学的时候他听教授讲爱默生的时候引用过一句诗：“美因美而在。”是爱默生写的吧？写的是“美”吧？但他又想起了安提娜。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He had loved her so much in his youth that he lived in a dream of happiness that she loved him. He could not believe that life could be so sweet. And little by little everything had been tarnished with decay.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他年轻时如此爱她，他一直活在她爱他的美梦里。他无法相信生活还能如此美妙，可一点一点地，一切都不复当年。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And Boz wondered at himself. Why had his own love turned to hate? It was simple really. Because he knew he could not possess her to the end of their lives; that one day he must lose her. That one day she would lie down with other men, that one day she would disappear from his Heaven. And never think of him again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="博兹又想到了自己。他的爱怎么变成了恨呢？其实很简单。因为他知道，他不可能天长地久地拥有她；他早晚有一天要失去她，早晚有一天她会躺在其他男人的身边，早晚有一天她会从他的世界消失，永远不再想他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Boz squinted up at him. "What a coincidence, both of us swimming on the same beach. What the fuck do you want?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="博兹眯起眼睛抬头看着他：“多巧啊，我竟然有幸跟你在同一片海滩游泳。你他妈想怎么样？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He felt the sun's warmth move off his face and opened his eyes. Looming above him was a very large, well-dressed man who was carrying a folding chair. Boz recognized him. It was Jim Losey, the detective who had interrogated him after he threw the water in Thena's face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他察觉到阳光的温暖从他脸上消失了。他睁开眼睛，看到一个身材高大、穿着得体的男人，拎着一把沙滩椅在居高临下地打量他。博兹认得他，吉姆·洛西。他往安提娜脸上泼水那次，审他的探员就是吉姆·洛西。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm on a public beach, there's a fence in between us, and I'm in a bathing suit. Do I look like I'm harassing her?" Boz said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我在公共海滩上，中间隔着栅栏，我还穿着泳裤，你觉得我看着像是要骚扰她吗？”博兹说道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Losey had a sympathetic smile on his face. "Hey, look," he said, "if I was married to that broad, I couldn't stay away from her either. How about if I take a look in your beach bag?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="洛西的脸上露出了同情的笑。“我明白，”他说，“我要是能娶她，我也离不开。让我看看你的沙滩包里都有什么，怎么样？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Losey unfolded the chair and sat on it. "My ex-wife gave me this chair. I was interrogating and arresting so many surfers she said I might as well be comfortable." He looked down at Boz Skannet almost kindly. "I just wanted to ask you a few questions. One, what are you doing so close to Miss Aquitane's house? You're violating the judge's restraining order."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="洛西展开椅子坐上去：“这把椅子是我前妻给我的。我抓的人里有不少都是玩冲浪的，所以她说我也该让自己舒服一点儿。”他颇为和善地俯视着博兹·斯堪尼特，“我只是想问你几个问题而已。第一个，你离安提娜·阿奎坦内小姐的房子这么近干什么？你违反了人身限制令。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Losey gave him a friendly smile. "Don't make me arrest you," he said. "Or just beat the shit out of you and take the bag."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="洛西和善地笑了笑。“别逼我抓你，”他说，“或者揍你一顿才把包拿过来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Losey admired the man's perceptiveness. In a physical struggle the issue might be in doubt. And there was no cause to draw a weapon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="洛西很佩服这个男人的洞察力。真要是打起来，他未必打得赢。要掏枪又确实没理由。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This aroused Boz. He stood up, he offered the bag to Losey, but then he held it away from him. "Try and take it," he said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这句话挑动了博兹。他站起来，伸手作势把包递给洛西，随即又把手缩回来。“来拿啊。”他说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jim Losey was startled. In his own estimation he had never met anybody tougher than himself. In any other situation he would have drawn his blackjack or his gun and beaten the man to a pulp. Perhaps it was the sand under his feet that made him uncertain, or perhaps it was the utter fearlessness of Skannet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉姆·洛西很诧异。他没想到有人会比他更加强硬。换了别人，他早就抽出警棍或者手枪，把对方痛揍一顿。这一次，也许是脚下的沙地，也许是斯堪尼特的无谓，他觉得不妥。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Boz put the beach bag beneath his head. "No," he said. "Unless you have a warrant."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="博兹把沙滩包拉过来枕在头下。“不行，”他说，“除非你有搜查令。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Boz was smiling at him. "You'll have to shoot me," he said. "I'm stronger than you. Big as you are. And if you shoot me, you won't have probable cause."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="博兹笑着说：“你只能开枪了。”他说，“我比你壮，跟你一样高。如果你开枪，你又没有正当理由。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Okay," he said. He folded up his chair and started to walk away. Then he turned and said admiringly, "You're really a tough guy. You win. But don't give me a good probable cause. You see I haven't measured your distance from the house, you may be just out of range of the judge's order…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧。”说罢，他收起椅子起身离开。然后又回头，用一种赞许的口吻说道：“算你狠。你赢了。但是，可别给我找到什么理由。我没测量你距离房子有多远，也许你正好超过了法官限定的范围…”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He watched Jim Losey walk off the beach to his car and drive away. Boz put his blanket into the beach bag and returned to his own car. He put the beach bag in the trunk, took the car key off its ring, and hid it under the front seat. Then he went back to the beach for his swim around the fence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他注视着吉姆·洛西离开沙滩、上车离开了。博兹把毯子塞进沙滩包里，找到了自己的车。他把沙滩包放进车的后座，拔下钥匙塞在前座底下。然后回到海滩，准备游过栅栏。">查看中文翻译</div>
