<div class="line_en">Far down the mountain in Arendelle, the air was still frigid and snow blanketed the land. People wondered if warm weather would ever return. The fjord was frozen solid, and all the dignitaries who had arrived for Elsa's coronation were forced to stay since their ships were stuck. In the meantime, men and women were working hard to unload supplies from the marooned boats and haul them to the castle, where they could be stored and distributed.</div>

<div class="line_en">The ice on the floor began to change and grow into a series of sharp spikes. Alarmed, she glanced out the window. The wind was rising as the weather whipped up to match her feelings of worry.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="暴风雪在他们周围变得更加猛烈了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Suddenly, a mass of snow rose from the ground behind Hans. It was Marshmallow! The huge snowman refused to move away from the palace entrance. As the volunteers pressed forward, Marshmallow reacted quickly, knocking men to the ground. Hans rolled to safety and grabbed his sword.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然，汉斯身后刮起了一阵风雪。棉花糖出现了！雪巨人挡在了宫殿门口。护卫们冲上前去，棉花糖一下子就把他们击倒在地。汉斯滚到了安全的地方，一把拿起了他的剑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then Elsa, still upset from Anna's visit, stepped out onto her balcony to see what was happening. She was spotted by one of the Duke's guards. They ducked around Marshmallow's legs, raced into the palace, and charged up the stairs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="艾莎对于安娜的来访仍有些不安，她走出房间来到阳台看到了外面发生的事。她被公爵的一名护卫发现了。他们从棉花糖的腿下钻过去，溜进宫殿，冲上了台阶。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At the top of mountain, Hans led the group around the rocky cliffs, and eventually they came upon the ice palace. He turned to the men as they all gaped at the spectacular structure. "We're here to find Princess Anna," he reminded them. "Be on guard, but no harm is to come to the queen."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在山顶上，汉斯带领大家爬上了峭壁，最终来到了冰雪宫殿。所有人都惊叹于眼前的这座壮观的建筑，汉斯提醒他们说：“我们是来找安娜公主的。大家提高警惕，但不要伤害到女王。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But the Duke's guards kept coming. Desperate to keep them away, she waved her arms, and the wall of ice forced one of the attackers onto the balcony. He teetered on the edge, trapped.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是公爵的护卫紧追不舍。情急之下，她扬起手，冰墙将一名护卫推到了阳台边缘。他踉踉跄跄地站在悬崖边上，被困住了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Outside the palace, Hans and his fighters continued to battle the powerful snowman. Hans swept Marshmallow's leg with his sword, forcing the snow giant to fall. Marshmallow rolled away and off a cliff. Hans and his men raced into the ice palace.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="宫殿外面，汉斯和护卫们继续和强大的巨雪人搏斗着。汉斯挥剑砍中了棉花糖的腿，巨雪人倒下来，滚下了悬崖。汉斯和手下立刻冲进了宫殿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There, he immediately spotted the guard trapped against the wall and the other one pushed to the very edge of the balcony. The man was just inches from falling to his death!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他一眼就看到了被钉在墙上的一名护卫，而另一名被困在阳台边缘的护卫差一点就要摔下去了！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The other guard was still coming after Elsa, with his crossbow ready to shoot. With another wave, Elsa created a series of icy spikes, pinning the man in place against the wall. The spikes came right up to his jaw, barely allowing him to breathe.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="另一名护卫仍然追着艾莎，并且准备用弩射击。艾莎又挥了一下手，变出了几根尖锐的冰柱，将他钉在了墙上。冰柱尖直指他的下巴，使得他快喘不过气了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Elsa saw the fright in the guard's eyes and hesitated. With a start, she realized she had gone too far; this was exactly what she had worked so long to avoid. As she looked down at her hands, the wall of ice retreated. She had always tried to keep people safe, not put them in more danger -- and now her self-control seemed to be dissolving entirely.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="艾莎看见了护卫眼中的恐惧，迟疑了。她发现自己正在慢慢变成这些年自己最害怕变成的样子。她低头看着自己的双手，冰墙后退了。她一直都尽力不伤害别人，不给别人造成危险——但现在她似乎完全无法自我控制了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Queen Elsa, no, please!" Hans called out. "Don't be the monster they fear you are!"</div>

<div class="line_en">But as the icy spikes melted away from the Duke's other guard, he aimed his crossbow at Elsa. Hans acted quickly. He pushed the man's crossbow aside, causing it to shoot at the ceiling. The loose arrow hit the chandelier above Elsa, sending it crashing to the floor. Shards of ice through the air… and Elsa fell, knocked unconscious.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但就在冰柱从伯爵的另一名护卫身边消退的时候，他举起弩瞄准艾莎。汉斯立刻扑上前去推开了弩，一支箭射向了天花板。射出的箭击中了艾莎正上方的吊灯，吊灯碎了一地。冰花四溅…艾莎被击中倒了下来，瞬间失去了意识。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hours later, Elsa's eyes fluttered open. She was in a stone room with one tiny window high on the wall letting a cold light into the room. Elsa rose from the bench where she lay -- and realized that she could not bring her arms forward. Her hands were encased in thick coverings, which were connected to long chains and bolted to the floor. She could see out the window well enough, though, to know that she was back in Arendelle. She was imprisoned in the castle dungeon and could see the snow continuing to fall over the kingdom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几个小时以后，艾莎微微睁开眼睛。她发现自己正躺在一间冰冷的小石屋里，冰冷的光线透过高墙上的一扇小窗照进房间。艾莎从躺着的长椅上站起来，发现手臂抬不起来了。她的双手戴上了沉重的镣铐，长长的链条紧紧锁在了地上。她可以清楚地看见窗外的景象，知道自己被带回了艾伦戴尔。她被关在了城堡的地牢里，眼睁睁地看着冰雪继续席卷着整个王国。">查看中文翻译</div>
