<div class="line_en">At the new year Philip became dresser in the surgical out-patients' department. The work was of the same character as that which he had just been engaged on, but with the greater directness which surgery has than medicine; and a larger proportion of the patients suffered from those two diseases which a supine public allows, in its prudishness, to be spread broadcast. The assistant-surgeon for whom Philip dressed was called Jacobs. He was a short, fat man, with an exuberant joviality, a bald head, and a loud voice; he had a cockney accent, and was generally described by the students as an `awful bounder'; but his cleverness, both as a surgeon and as a teacher, caused some of them to overlook this. He had also a considerable facetiousness, which he exercised impartially on the patients and on the students. He took a great pleasure in making his dressers look foolish. Since they were ignorant, nervous, and could not answer as if he were their equal, this was not very difficult. He enjoyed his afternoons, with the home truths he permitted himself, much more than the students who had to put up with them with a smile. One day a case came up of a boy with a club-foot. His parents wanted to know whether anything could be done. Mr. Jacobs turned to Philip.</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip flushed, all the more because the surgeon spoke obviously with a humorous intention, and his brow-beaten dressers laughed obsequiously. It was in point of fact a subject which Philip, since coming to the hospital, had studied with anxious attention. He had read everything in the library which treated of talipes in its various forms. He made the boy take off his boot and stocking. He was fourteen, with a snub nose, blue eyes, and a freckled face. His father explained that they wanted something done if possible, it was such a hindrance to the kid in earning his living. Philip looked at him curiously. He was a jolly boy, not at all shy, but talkative and with a cheekiness which his father reproved. He was much interested in his foot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普羞得面红耳赤，不仅仅是因为自己的残疾，更是因为医生说话时那种嘲弄调侃的语气。其他包扎员缓过神来，也开始附上谄媚的大笑。事实上，从进医院学习开始，他就对这个课题格外上心，把图书馆里关于各种形态畸形足的书都读了一遍。他让男孩把靴袜脱下来。男孩十四岁，小鼻子翘翘的，蓝眼珠，脸上有星星雀斑。他父亲解释说如果有可能的话，希望能给他治一治，这只跛脚对孩子以后谋个好的生计影响太大了。菲利普好奇地看着男孩。他是个活泼的孩子，一点也不怕生，很爱说话，腆着脸和谁都能聊起来，父亲因此一直在呵斥他。他对自己的跛足很感兴趣。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip examined the foot and passed his hand slowly over the shapelessness of it. He could not understand why the boy felt none of the humiliation which always oppressed himself. He wondered why he could not take his deformity with that philosophic indifference. Presently Mr. Jacobs came up to him. The boy was sitting on the edge of a couch, the surgeon and Philip stood on each side of him; and in a semi-circle, crowding round, were students. With accustomed brilliancy Jacobs gave a graphic little discourse upon the club-foot: he spoke of its varieties and of the forms which followed upon different anatomical conditions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普检查了这只脚，用手慢慢触摸着变形的部位。他不知道为什么男孩没有感受到那种一直压迫着他的屈辱，也不明白他怎么就不能以一种通达淡漠的态度对待残疾。雅各布先生朝他走过来。男孩坐在沙发边上，医生和菲利普各站一侧，其他学生纷纷挤过来，围成一个半圆。雅各布医生谈吐机智，一如往常，生动形象地把这只跛足描述了一遍：讲了各种跛足的类型和不同畸形的解剖特征。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip had often asked himself whether anything could be done, but his distaste for any reference to the subject had prevented him from consulting any of the surgeons at the hospital. His reading told him that whatever might have been done when he was a small boy, and then treatment of talipes was not as skilful as in the present day, there was small chance now of any great benefit. Still it would be worth while if an operation made it possible for him to wear a more ordinary boot and to limp less. He remembered how passionately he had prayed for the miracle which his uncle had assured him was possible to omnipotence. He smiled ruefully.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普过去常问自己，难道对于他的跛脚，真的没有什么能做的了？可他不愿谈起自己的残疾，所以迟迟没有找院里的医生问询。他通过读书才知道，就算小时候做了什么治疗估计也不会有太大改善。因为那个时候治疗畸形足的技术还不如现在发达。可要是能让他穿上正常的靴子，走路不要一瘸一拐，做场手术也还是值得的。他还记得自己曾经多么虔诚地向上帝祈祷，恳求奇迹降临，只因伯父跟自己保证只要诚心诚意，就能感动上天。他苦涩地一笑，心想：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Leonard Upjohn blew in two or three times a week, and there was something of the dead leaf in his appearance which made the word exactly descriptive of the manner of his appearance. He was a weedy-looking fellow of five-and-thirty, with long pale hair and a white face; he had the look of a man who lived too little in the open air. He wore a hat like a dissenting minister's. Philip disliked him for his patronising manner and was bored by his fluent conversation. Leonard Upjohn liked to hear himself talk. He was not sensitive to the interest of his listeners, which is the first requisite of the good talker; and he never realised that he was telling people what they knew already. With measured words he told Philip what to think of Rodin, Albert Samain, and Caesar Franck. Philip's charwoman only came in for an hour in the morning, and since Philip was obliged to be at the hospital all day Cronshaw was left much alone. Upjohn told Philip that he thought someone should remain with him, but did not offer to make it possible.</div>

<div class="line_en">Next day Philip went to Dr. Tyrell. He felt that he was the sort of man to be interested by the story, and as soon as Tyrell was free of his day's work he accompanied Philip to Kennington. He could only agree with what Philip had told him. The case was hopeless.</div>
