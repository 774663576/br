<div class="line_en">Imagine to yourselves a little, fat man, much wider than he was long, round and shiny as a ball of butter, with a face beaming like an apple, a little mouth that always smiled, and a voice small and wheedling like that of a cat begging for food.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="请诸位想象那么个小个子，横里宽，直里短，软扑扑，油腻腻，像一球黄油，苹果脸，嘴巴很小，老是笑嘻嘻的，声音又尖又嗲，似猫向主人讨吃时的叫声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In fact the wagon was so closely packed with boys of all ages that it looked like a box of sardines. They were uncomfortable, they were piled one on top of the other, they could hardly breathe; yet not one word of complaint was heard. The thought that in a few hours they would reach a country where there were no schools, no books, no teachers, made these boys so happy that they felt neither hunger, nor thirst, nor sleep, nor discomfort.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说实在的，车上八岁到十二岁的孩子都已经挤满了，一个叠一个，活像一堆腌鳀鱼。他们给挤得够呛，连气都几乎透不过来，可是没人叫一声“唉呀！”没人说一句埋怨话。他们感到安慰，因为他们知道，过几个钟头他们就要到一个国家，那儿没有书本，没有学校，没有老师。他们高兴得什么都能忍耐，他们不觉得苦，不觉得累，不觉得饿，不觉得渴，甚至不觉得瞌睡。">查看中文翻译</div>

How well I can prove it to you! A day will come when you will weep bitterly, even as I am weeping now -- but it will be too late!"</div>

<div class="line_en">This great land was entirely different from any other place in the world. Its population, large though it was, was composed wholly of boys. The oldest were about fourteen years of age, the youngest, eight. In the street, there was such a racket, such shouting, such blowing of trumpets, that it was deafening. Everywhere groups of boys were gathered together. Some played at marbles, at hopscotch, at ball. Others rode on bicycles or on wooden horses. Some played at blindman's buff, others at tag. Here a group played circus, there another sang and recited. A few turned somersaults, others walked on their hands with their feet in the air. Generals in full uniform leading regiments of cardboard soldiers passed by. Laughter, shrieks, howls, catcalls, hand-clapping followed this parade. One boy made a noise like a hen, another like a rooster, and a third imitated a lion in his den. All together they created such a pandemonium that it would have been necessary for you to put cotton in your ears. The squares were filled with small wooden theaters, overflowing with boys from morning till night, and on the walls of the houses, written with charcoal, were words like these: HURRAH FOR THE LAND OF TOYS! DOWN WITH ARITHMETIC! NO MORE SCHOOL!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个国家跟世界上任何国家不同。它全国都是小孩子，最大的十四岁，最小的才八岁。满街都是嘻嘻哈哈声，吵闹声，叫喊声，叫人头都搞昏了！到处是一群群的小捣蛋：有的打弹子，有的扔石片，有的打球，有的蹬自行车，有的骑木马，有的捉迷藏，有的玩追人，有的扮小丑吃火，有的朗诵，有的唱歌，有的翻跟头，有的竖蜻蜓，有的滚铁环，有的身穿将军装，装戴纸头盔，骑一只硬纸板做的马，有的笑，有的叫，有的喊，有的拍手，有的吹口哨，有的学母鸡生蛋咯咯叫。总而言之是一片乱七八糟，大吵大闹，叫人得用棉花塞住耳朵，别让耳朵给震聋了。所有的广场都只见小戏棚，从早到晚挤满了孩子。所有的墙上都可以读到用炭写的最好玩的东西，像：“完具万水：”（应该是“玩具万岁！”）“我们不在要学小！”（应该是我们不再要学校！”）“打到算树！”（应该是“打倒算术！”）等等，等等。">查看中文翻译</div>
