<div class="line_en">Only at the arrival of a small but haunting noise did he stir, his eyelids lifting heavily. He had already been to four pockets of heaven, met four people, and while each had been mystifying upon arrival, he sensed that this was something altogether different.</div>

<div class="line_en">White was all Eddie saw. All he heard was his own labored breathing, followed by an echo of that breathing. He inhaled and heard a louder inhale. He exhaled, and it exhaled, too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱迪所能看见的就是这一片白色。他唯一听到的声音，是自己吃力的喘息声和它的回响。他一吸气，便会听到一个更响的吸气声。他一呼气，周围也跟着呼气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">White. There was only white now. No earth, no sky, no horizon between the two. Only a pure and silent white, as noiseless as the deepest snowfall at the quietest sunrise.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="白色，四周是一片白色。没天，没地，也没有两者之间的地平线。只有一片纯洁、寂静的白色，无声无息，宛如静谧的破晓时分，一场铺天盖地的大雪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Eddie squeezed his eyes shut. Silence is worse when you know it won't be broken, and Eddie knew. His wife was gone. He wanted her desperately, one more minute, half a minute, five more seconds, but there was no way to reach or call or wave or even look at her picture. He felt as if he'd tumbled down steps and was crumpled at the bottom. His soul was vacant. He had no impulse. He hung limp and lifeless in the void, as if on a hook, as if all the fluids had been gored out of him. He might have hung there a day or a month. It might have been a century.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱迪紧紧地闭上眼睛。那沉静，当你知道无法打破的时候，会觉得更难忍受。爱迪知道自己无能为力。他的妻子去了。他不顾一切地想挽留她，哪怕一分钟，半分钟，甚至五秒钟，但是，他无法再够到她，无法呼唤，无法招手，甚至无法再看到她的照片。他感到自己好像从楼梯上滚下来，瘫倒在地上。他的灵魂是一片空虚。他万念俱灰。他被吞没在这虚无中，了无生气，好像被挂在一个钩子上，身体里所有的液体都流尽了。他可能已经挂在那里一天了，一个月了，也可能已经一个世纪了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He clenched his teeth, as if that might make it stop, but it continued on, like an unheeded alarm, until Eddie yelled into the choking whiteness: "What is it? What do you want?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱迪咬紧牙关，好像这样就可以让那个声音停止，但是，那个声音还在，像一个没人理会的警报器，爱迪终于朝着令人窒息的白茫茫的空间叫道，“这是什么东西呀？你要怎么样？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In human accounting, his body was near its end.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在世人的眼里，他的身体已经陈腐不堪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The tremor of noise came again, louder now, and Eddie, in a lifelong defense instinct, clenched his fists, only to find his right hand squeezing a cane. His forearms were pocked with liver spots. His fingernails were small and yellowish. His bare legs carried the reddish rash -- shingles -- that had come during his final weeks on earth. He looked away from his hastening decay.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那个颤抖的声音又传过来，清晰了一些，爱迪出于自卫的本能，攥紧了拳头，结果发现右手上正抓着一根拐杖。他的前臂布满了褐斑。他的指甲细小且泛黄。他裸露着的两腿上是那些红疹子－－带状疱疹－－他在人世间最后几个星期里得的毛病。他把目光移开，不想再看自己正在迅速衰朽的身体。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">With that, the high-pitched noise moved to the background, layered atop a second noise, a loose, relentless rumble -- the sound of a running river -- and the whiteness shrank to a sun spot reflecting off shimmering waters. Ground appeared beneath Eddie's feet. His cane touched something solid. He was high up on an embankment, where a breeze blew across his face and a mist brought his skin to a moist glaze. He looked down and saw, in the river, the source of those haunting screeches, and he was flushed with the relief of a man who finds, while gripping the baseball bat, that there is no intruder in his house. The sound, this screaming, whistling, thrumming screak, was merely the cacophony of children's voices, thousands of them at play, splashing in the river and shrieking with innocent laughter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随着他的叫喊，那个尖锐的声音退到了远处，然而，另一个声音，一个哗啦啦奔流不息的声音却隆隆地传过来－－原来是一条流动的河－－四周白茫茫的空间开始收缩，凝聚成了粼粼河面上的反射的一点阳光。大地出现在爱迪的脚下。他的拐杖触到了坚硬的上地。他高高地站在河岸上，微风吹拂着他的面颊，薄雾将他的皮肤滋润得光滑闪亮。他低头去看，发现原来那个萦绕不散的尖叫声是从这河里传出来的，他如释重负，像一个手抓棒球棍的男人，发现家里并没有人闯进来。那个声音，似尖叫，似哨子，似单调的琴音，其实只不过是～群孩子在乱喊乱叫，成千上万个孩子在玩耍，他们在河水里嬉戏着，天真无邪地大声欢笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now came the sound again, a high-pitched rolling of irregular shrieks and lulls. In life, Eddie had heard this sound in his nightmares, and he shuddered with the memory: the village, the fire, Smitty and this noise, this squealing cackle that, in the end, emerged from his own throat when he tried to speak.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那个声音又传过来，是一阵断断续续、起伏不定、尖锐刺耳的叫声。爱迪活着的时候，一旦在噩梦里听到这个声音，记忆便令他不寒而栗：村子、大火、史密迪，还有这个声音，这个尖声叫唤，末了，他一旦开口，这声音便会从他自己的喉咙里发出来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Was this what I'd been dreaming? he thought. All this time? Why?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我一直梦到的就是这个吗？他心想。这么久？为什么？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And then Eddie's eyes were drawn to a white boulder. A slender young girl stood upon it, apart from the others, facing his direction.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后，爱迪的目光被吸引到一块白色巨石上。一个身材纤细的小女孩站在上面，离其他孩子远远的，面朝着他的方向。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He studied the small bodies, some jumping, some wading, some carrying buckets while others rolled in the high grass. He noticed a certain calmness to it all, no rough-housing, which you usually saw with kids. He noticed something else. There were no adults. Not even teenagers. These were all small children, with skin the color of dark wood, seemingly monitoring themselves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他望着那些小小的身影，有的在跳跃，有的在蹬水，有的拎着水桶，有的在茂盛的草地上打滚。但是，他注意到其中有一种相对的平静。他见不到通常孩子们在一起时的推搡打闹。他还注意到另一个现象。这里没有成人，甚至连少年也没有。这些都是小孩子，皮肤黝黑得像黑木头，似乎是在自己照看自己。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Eddie lowered his cane to navigate the downward slope. He slipped, his bad knee buckling, his legs giving way. But before he hit the earth, he felt a sudden blast of wind at his back and he was whipped forward and straightened on his feet, and there he was, standing before the little girl as if he'd been there all the time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱迪放下拐杖，试探着朝坡下走去。他脚下一滑，坏膝一瘸，两腿瘫软下去。但是，在他倒地之前，他感到一阵疾风从背后吹来，将他向前托起，然后，他直直地站到了双腿上，他站在那里，站在那个小女孩面前，好像他一直就站在那里一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She motioned with both her hands, waving him in. He hesitated. She smiled. She waved again and nodded, as if to say, Yes, you.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她两于挥动着，示意他过去。他踌躇着。她微笑一下。她又挥挥手，点点头，好像在说，对，就是你。">查看中文翻译</div>
