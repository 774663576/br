He posted the letters and turned to hurry home again. As he was running past a pub in the main street, he accidentally bumped into a tall man in black coming out. The man stared at Oliver. "What the devil's this?" he said, stepping back.</div>

He was no longer a beadle but the manager of the workhouse, and his wife, formerly Mrs Corney, scolded and argued with him day and night. One evening, after a particularly violent fight, when she threw things at him and chased him out of the house, he went for a walk alone through the town. He felt very sorry for himself, and finally went into a pub to find comfort in gin-and-water. A tall dark man, sitting in the corner, watched Mr Bumble while he drank.

<div class="line_en">"Nothing. It was only a receipt from a pawnbroker. I went to the pawnbroker and got back a little gold locket. Inside was a gold wedding ring and on the locket itself, the name Agnes." She put the locket on the table in front of Monks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“什么都没有，是一家当铺的收条。我找到了这家当铺，赎回的是一个挂在项链上面的小金盒子，里面放着一枚金的结婚戒指，金盒子上写的人名是 ‘阿格尼丝’。”她把小金盒子放在了桌子上蒙克斯的面前。">查看中文翻译</div>
