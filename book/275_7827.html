<div class="line_en">It was on a Sunday morning at harvest time, just when the buckwheat was in bloom. The sun was shining bright in the heaven, the morning wind was blowing warmly across the stubble, the larks were singing in the air, the bees were buzzing in the buckwheat, and the people in their Sunday best were on their way to church, and all the creatures were happy, including the hedgehog.</div>

<div class="line_en">This story was actually made up, young ones, but it really is true, for my grandfather, who told it to me, always said whenever he told it, "it must be true, my son, otherwise it couldn't be told." Anyway, this is how the story goes:</div>

<div class="line_en">The hedgehog was standing before his door with his arms crossed, humming a little song to himself, neither better nor worse than hedgehogs usually sing on a nice Sunday morning. Singing there to himself, half silently, it suddenly occurred to him that while his wife was washing and drying the children, he could take a little walk into the field and see how his turnips were doing. The turnips were close by his house, and he and his family were accustomed to eating them, so he considered them his own.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="刺蝟正双手叉腰，靠门站着，享受这清晨的和风，悠闲地哼着小曲，这首歌和他平时星期天早上唱的歌没有甚么两样。他悠闲地半哼半唱着，突然想起了要趁自己的女人正给孩子们洗澡的当儿，去看看他的萝蔔长势如何。这些萝蔔其实并不是他的，只是离他家很近，他和他的家人就习以为常地靠吃这些萝蔔度日，他也理所当然地把它当成是他自己的了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'm taking a walk," said the hedgehog.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「我在散步。」刺蝟说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This answer made the hedgehog terribly angry, for he could stand anything except remarks about his legs, for by nature they were crooked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="刺蝟听到这回答非常气愤，他一切都可忍受，只有自己的腿不能提，因为大自然给了他一双短短的弯腿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">No sooner said than done. The hedgehog closed the house door behind him and started down the path to the field. He hadn't gone very far away from his house at all, only as far as the blackthorn bush which stands at the front of the field, near the turnip patch, when he met up with the hare, who had gone out for a similar purpose, namely to examine his cabbage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说干就干，只见他关上身后的门，随即就踏上了去萝蔔地的路。他在离家不远的地方绕过了地边仅有的一丛灌木，正准备到地里去时，他看到了为同样目的出门的野兔，他也想去看看自己的白菜长得怎样了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Taking a walk?" laughed the hare. "I should think that you could better use your legs for other purposes."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「散步？」野兔微微一笑，「我想你可以用你的腿干点更好的事吧。」">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Do you imagine," said the hedgehog to the hare, "that you can accomplish more with your legs?"</div>

<div class="line_en">When the hedgehog saw the hare, he wished him a friendly good morning. The hare, however, who was in his own way a distinguished gentleman, and terribly arrogant about it, did not answer the hedgehog's greeting, but instead said to the hedgehog, in a terribly sarcastic manner, "How is it that you are running around in the field so early in the morning?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="刺蝟看到野兔时友好地和他道了声早安，但野兔自以为是位不同寻常的绅士，表现得非常傲慢无礼，连刺蝟的问候也不搭理，只是以一种很轻蔑的态度对刺蝟说：「你怎么这么一大清早就在地边跑？」">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We'll begin running from up there. All you have to do is to stand here in the furrow, and when the hare approaches from the other side, just call out to him, 'I'm already here.'"</div>

In other words, a hedgehog should always take care that his wife is also a hedgehog, and so forth.</div>
