<div class="line_en">The other woman" is what it's called, but Britt-Marie always had difficulties viewing Kent's other woman as that. Maybe because she herself knew how it felt to be that woman. Admittedly Kent had already divorced when he came back to the house that day, a lifetime earlier, after Britt-Marie had buried her mother, but his children never saw it that way. Children never see it that way. As far as David and Pernilla were concerned, Britt-Marie was the other woman regardless of how many fairy tales she read them and how many dinners she cooked -- and maybe Kent also regarded her as such. And despite the number of shirts she had washed, maybe Britt-Marie never quite felt like the primary woman herself.</div>

Britt-Marie pushes them as far as they'll go into a corner, puts out kitchen roll as a tablecloth, and then sits there on her own eating pizza that Somebody has baked for her.

Liverpool were up against Milan in the Champions League final. Britt-Marie asks whether this is a competition, and Sami answers that it's a cup, and Britt-Marie asks what a cup is, and Sami says it's a sort of competition, whereupon Britt-Marie points out that he could just have said that from the start instead of giving himself airs and graces.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后他给她讲了一段关于足球的历史。这段历史始于十年前，那时薇卡和奥马尔还围着尿布，不过萨米和疯子经常带这两个小东西去披萨店坐着。那一年的欧冠决赛上，利物浦队和AC米兰对踢。听到这儿，布里特—玛丽问“欧冠”是不是一种比赛，萨米回答说是杯赛，布里特—玛丽又问什么是杯赛，萨米回答说那是一种比赛，布里特—玛丽于是一针见血地抱怨道，为什么他一上来不说那就是一种比赛，还扯什么“杯赛”的概念，绕这么大的圈子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then he explains that Milan were in the lead by 3-0 at half-time, and no team in any final of any soccer competition for as long as Sami can remember had ever been so exposed and outplayed as Liverpool in this match. But in the changing rooms, one of the players from the Liverpool team stood yelling like a madman at the others, because he would not go along with a world where there were certain things that could not be turned around. In the second half he headed in a goal to make it 3-1, then waved his arms like crazy and ran back down the pitch. When his team scored again to make it 3-2 he was on his way to heaven, because he and all the others saw it now, saw that there was an avalanche in motion and no one could stop them from turning it around. Not with walls, moats, and ten thousand wild horses would it be possible to hold them back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后他继续说，上半场米兰3∶0领先。据他所知，在任何足球决赛的历史上，从来没有像利物浦队这样在上半场就输得这么惨的。中场休息时，利物浦队的一个球员在更衣室里嚎叫起来，像个神经病，因为他觉得比分还能扳回来，谁不相信他就和谁绝交。后来到了下半场，他踢进了一个球，比分变成3∶1，然后他又像个神经病那样摇晃着胳膊在球场里乱窜。当利物浦队又进了一个球，比分变成3∶2的时候，他嗨得简直像进了天堂，因为大家亲眼见证了奇迹的发生：没人能阻止他们让对手好看，连石头墙、壕沟，甚至一万匹野马都挡不住他们。">查看中文翻译</div>
