<div class="line_en">Mr. Burke had begun to repair the old Perkins place. After Christmas, Mrs. Burke was right in the middle of writing a book, so she wasn't available to help, which left Leslie the jobs of hunting and fetching. For all his smartness with politics and music, Mr. Burke was inclined to be absent-minded. He would put down the hammer to pick up the "How to' book and then lose the hammer between there and the project he was working on. Leslie was good at finding things for him, and he liked her company as well. When she came home from school and on the weekends, he wanted her around. Leslie explained all this to Jess.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jess tried going to Terabithia alone, but it was no good. It needed Leslie to make the magic. He was afraid he would destroy everything by trying to force the magic on his own, when it was plain that the magic was reluctant to come for him.</div>

<div class="line_en">If he went home, either his mother was after him to do some chore or May Belle wanted him to play Barbie. Lord, he wished a million times he'd never helped buy that stupid doll. He'd no more than lie down on the floor to paint than May Belle would be after him to put an arm back on or snap up a dress. Joyce Ann was worse. She got a devilish delight out of sitting smack down on his rump when he was stretched out working. If he yelled at her to get the heck off him, she'd stick her index finger in the corner of her mouth and holler. Which would, of course, crank up his mother.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sometimes he would sneak down to the old Perkins place and find Prince Terrien crying on the porch, where Mr. Burke had exiled him. You couldn't blame the man. No one could get anything done with that animal grabbing his hand or jumping up to lick his face. He'd take P. T. for a romp in the Burkes' upper field. If it was a mild day, Miss Bessie would be mooing nervously from across the fence. She couldn't seem to get used to the yipping and snapping. Or maybe it was the time of year -- the last dregs of winter spoiling the taste of everything. Nobody, human or animal, seemed happy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有时候，他会偷偷跑到老帕金斯家，看见被伯克先生流放在外面的泰伦王子在走廊里哀嚎。你也不能责怪他。如果有那只动物在你的手里乱抓或跳着想要舔你的脸，那就没法干活了。他会带着P.T。到伯克家地势高的田野里嬉闹。如果天气温和，贝茜小姐会在栅栏的那头紧张地哞哞叫。看来她是永远也无法适应狗叫了。又或许是因为正好处在一年的这个时段——冬天的残余破坏了一切事物的美味。所有的，包括人和动物，都不会感到高兴。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Except Leslie. She was crazy about fixing up that broken-down old wreck of a house. She loved being needed by her father. Half the time they were supposed to be working they were just yakking away. She was learning, she related glowingly at recess, to "understand" her father. It had never occurred to Jess that parents were meant to be understood any more than the safe at the Millsburg First National was sitting around begging him to crack it. Parents were what they were; it wasn't up to you to try to puzzle them out. There was something weird about a grown man wanting to be friends with his own child. He ought to have friends his own age and let her have hers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="除了莱斯利。她对修好那个又旧又破的房子非常着迷。她喜欢被她爸爸需要的感觉。在他们本来应该工作的时候，有一半时间他们只是在一起没完没了地聊天。她在学习，正如她在课间时热切地对杰斯说过的，去“理解”她的爸爸。杰斯从来没想过，父母需要被理解的就跟米尔斯堡的元首坐在他身边，哀求着想要被他打。父母就是父母，根本就不需要靠你去为他们答疑解惑。一个成年人想和自己的孩子成为朋友确实有些怪异。他需要跟他的同龄人交朋友，也让她跟她的同龄人交朋友。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jess's feelings about Leslie's father poked up like a canker sore. You keep biting it, and it gets bigger and worse instead of better. You spend a lot of time trying to keep your teeth away from it. Then sure as Christmas you forget the silly thing and chomp right down on it. Lord, that man got in his way. It even poisoned what time he did have with Leslie. She'd be sitting there bubbling away at recess, and it would be almost like the old times; then without warning, she'd say, "Bill thinks so and so." Chomp. Right down on the old sore.</div>

<div class="line_en">First they ripped out the boards that covered the ancient fireplace, coming upon the rusty bricks like prospectors upon the mother lode. Next they got the old wallpaper off the living-room wall -- all five garish layers of it. Sometimes as they lovingly patched and painted, they listened to Bill's records or sang, Leslie and Jess teaching Bill some of Miss Edmunds' songs and Bill teaching them some he knew. At other times they would talk. Jess listened wonderingly as Bill explained things that were going on in the world. If Momma could hear him, she'd swear he was another Walter Cronkite instead of "some hippie." All the Burkes were smart. Not smart, maybe, about fixing things or growing things, but smart in a way Jess had never known real live people to be. Like one day while they were working, Judy came down and read out loud to them, mostly poetry and some of it in Italian which, of course, Jess couldn't understand, but he buried his head in the rich sound of the words and let himself be wrapped warmly around in the feel of the Burkes' brilliance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="首先，他们剥下了覆盖着古老的壁炉的木板，露出腐蚀掉的砖头，就像勘探者寻找矿脉一样。之后，他们把客厅里的老旧的墙纸也撕了下来——五层艳俗的墙纸都撕掉。有时候，他们一边热切地修补和粉刷，一边听着比尔收集的唱片或声乐。莱斯利和杰斯会教比尔一些艾徳梦丝小姐的歌，比尔也会教他们一些他知道的歌。其他时间他们会聊聊天儿。杰斯惊异地听着比尔解释那些发生在世界各个角落的事。如果妈妈能听到他说的话，她会发誓他是又一个沃尔特·克朗凯特，而不是什么“嬉皮士”。伯克家的人都很聪明，也许在找东西和种地方面并非如此，但是杰斯确实没有见过哪一个活着的人有他这样的聪明。比如说，有一天他们正在工作时，朱蒂走下楼来大声地向他们朗读，读的大多数都是诗歌，有的还是意大利文，当然，杰斯听不懂，但他还是沉醉在了这丰富而动听的音韵中，让自己暖暖地包裹在伯克一家人的才华里。【注：Walter Leland Cronkite，记者、久负盛名的新闻主持人，被称为最可信任的美国人。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Leslie gave a deep satisfied sigh. "I love this room," she said. "Don't you feel the golden enchantment of it? It is worthy to be"-- Jess looked up in sudden alarm --"in a palace." Relief. In such a mood, a person might even let a sworn secret slip. But she hadn't, not even to Bill and Judy, and he knew how she felt about her parents. She must have seen his anxiety because she winked at him across Bill and Judy just as he sometimes winked at May Belle over Joyce Ann's head. Terabithia was still just for the two of them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱斯利满足地深深叹了口气。“我喜欢这个房间，”她说，“难道你感觉不到它金色的魔力吗？它配得上”——杰斯突然警觉地抬起头——“一座宫殿。”杰斯松了一口气。在这种情绪下，一个人可能把发誓不说的秘密说漏了嘴。但她没有，即使是对比尔和朱蒂，即使她是这样地爱他们。她一定看出了他的不安，因为她隔着比尔和朱蒂朝他眨了眨眼，就像有的时候他越过乔伊丝·安的头顶向梅宝眨眼一样。特雷比西亚还是只属于他们两个人的。">查看中文翻译</div>
