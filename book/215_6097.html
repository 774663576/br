<div class="line_en">My father doesn't have a studio or anything, and since the garage is stuffed with things that everyone thinks they need but no one ever uses, he paints outside.</div>

<div class="line_en">Outside is where the best landscapes are, only they're nowhere near our house. So what he does is keep a camera in his truck. His job as a mason takes him to lots of different locations, and he's always on the lookout for a great sunrise or sunset, or even just a nice field with sheep or cows. Then he picks out one of the snapshots, clips it to his easel, and paints.</div>

<div class="line_en">I love to watch my father paint. Or really, I love to hear him talk while he paints. The words always come out soft and somehow heavy when he's brushing on the layers of a landscape. Not sad. Weary, maybe, but peaceful.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我很爱看我爸爸画画。真的，我也喜欢一边看他画画一边听他讲话。不知为什么，那些词汇会在他的刷子蘸在风景画上时温柔而沉重地冒出来。并不是忧伤。也许有些疲乏，但是很平静。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The paintings come out fine, but I've always felt a little sorry for him, having to paint beautiful scenes in our backyard, which is not exactly picturesque. It never was much of a yard, but after I started raising chickens, things didn't exactly improve.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="画总是很好看，但是我总是为他感到一点遗憾，必须要在我们的并不美丽的后院画美丽的东西。它看起来并不像个院子，而且自从我开始养鸡，情况更没有什么好转。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dad doesn't seem to see the backyard or the chickens when he's painting, though. It's not just the snapshot or the canvas he sees either. It's something much bigger. He gets this look in his eye like he's transcended the yard, the neighborhood, the world. And as his big, callused hands sweep a tiny brush against the canvas, it's almost like his body has been possessed by some graceful spiritual being.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是爸爸似乎并不能在画画的时候看见院子或鸡。而他能看见的似乎不仅仅是照片和画布。而是什么更大的东西。他的眼睛里有某种东西让他看起来已经脱离了院子，街区，甚至世界。当他结满老茧的大手拿着小小的刷子扫过画布时，这看起来几乎像是他的身体被什么优美的灵魂占据了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When I was little, my dad would let me sit beside him on the porch while he painted, as long as I'd be quiet. I don't do quiet easily, but I discovered that after five or ten minutes without a peep, he'd start talking.</div>

<div class="line_en">Proper lighting? What was that supposed to mean? I sat there wondering, but I was afraid that by asking I'd be admitting that I wasn't mature enough to understand, and for some reason it felt obvious. Like I should understand.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mostly the things he talked about floated around me, but once in a while something would happen and I would understand exactly what he had meant. "A painting is more than the sum of its parts," he would tell me, and then go on to explain how the cow by itself is just a cow, and the meadow by itself is just grass and flowers, and the sun peeking through the trees is just a beam of light, but put them all together and you've got magic.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大部分时间他说的话我都没听进去，但是一段时间过后会发生一些事，我就能够完全理解他的意思。“一幅画并不仅仅是它各个部分的简单组合。”他会告诉我，然后继续解释一头牛只是一头牛，草地只是一片长满青草和花朵的土地，透过树枝的阳光也只不过是一束光线而已，但是将它们组合在一起，你却会发现奇迹。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I've flown kites before and I know -- sometimes they're gone forever, and sometimes they're just waiting in the middle of the road for you to rescue them. Kites can be lucky or they can be ornery. I've had both kinds, and a lucky kite is definitely worth chasing after.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我以前放过风筝所以我知道——有的时候它们永远地飞走了，有的时候它们会等待在路中央等你去救它们。风筝可以很幸运或者坏脾气。两种类型的我都有过，幸运的风筝总是值得被追逐。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The sycamore tree had been at the top of the hill forever. It was on a big vacant lot, giving shade in the summer and a place for birds to nest in the spring. It had a built-in slide for us, too. Its trunk bent up and around in almost a complete spiral, and it was so much fun to ride down. My mom told me she thought the tree must have been damaged as a sapling but survived, and now, maybe a hundred years later, it was still there, the biggest tree she'd ever seen. "A testimony to endurance" is what she called it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那棵梧桐树一直以来就在山坡的高处。那是块很大的空地，在夏天洒下绿荫，给鸟儿一个栖息地。我们还有一个建造的滑道。它的树干几乎弯曲成一个完整的螺旋形，从上面滑下来非常有趣。妈妈对我说，这棵树还是幼苗的时候可能被损害过，但它活了下来，现在，可能是一百年之后，她还在那儿，是她所见过的最大的树。她把她叫做“一个忍耐的证明”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I had always played in the tree, but I didn't become a serious climber until the fifth grade, when I went up to rescue a kite that was stuck in its branches. I'd first spotted the kite floating free through the air and then saw it dive-bomb somewhere up the hill by the sycamore tree.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我经常在树上玩，但是我没有成为一个真正的爬树高手，直到五年级，我爬上去解救了一个被树梢挂住的风筝。我先发现一只风筝在空中飘浮，接下去，它一个俯冲就栽在了山坡的梧桐树上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ornery kites dive-bomb out of spite. They never get exhausted because they won't stay up long enough to poop out. Thirty feet up they just sort of smirk at you and crash for the fun of it.</div>

<div class="line_en">This kite looked lucky to me. It wasn't anything fancy, just an old-fashioned diamond with blue and yellow stripes. But it stuttered along in a friendly way, and when it dive-bombed, it seemed to do so from exhaustion as opposed to spite.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个风筝对我来说挺幸运。它并不华丽，只是老式的菱形风筝，上面有蓝黄相间的条纹。但是它以一种很友好的方式飞行，而且它栽在树上也只是因为筋疲力尽，而并不是出于恶意。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was a long ways up, but I thought I'd give it a shot. I shinnied up the trunk, took a shortcut across the slide, and started climbing. Champ kept a good eye on me, barking me along, and soon I was higher than I'd ever been. But still the kite seemed forever away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爬上去会是很长一段路，但是我认为我能做到。我攀上了树干，从滑道的地方抄近路，然后开始向上爬。钱普一直注视着我，冲着我叫，没一会儿我就爬到了以前从没到过的高度。但是风筝看起来还是遥不可及。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then a few months ago I found myself talking to the tree. An entire conversation, just me and a tree. And on the climb down I felt like crying. Why didn't I have someone real to talk to? Why didn't I have a best friend like everyone else seemed to? Sure, there were kids I knew at school, but none of them were close friends. They'd have no interest in climbing the tree. In smelling the sunshine.</div>
