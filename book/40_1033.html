<div class="line_en">Mariam had never before worn a burqa. Rasheed had to help her put it on. The padded headpiece felt tight and heavy on her skull, and it was strange seeing the world through a mesh screen. She practiced walking around her room in it and kept stepping on the hem and stumbling. The loss of peripheral vision was unnerving, and she did not like the suffocating way the pleated cloth kept pressing against her mouth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽雅姆此前从未穿过布卡。拉希德只好帮她穿上。加了衬垫的头套很沉重，紧紧裹着她的脑壳；隔着一层网状的屏障看世界也是很奇怪的体验。她穿着布卡，在她的房间里练习走路，老是踩到裙边，步履蹒跚。由于看不到周边的境况，她变得很紧张，而且她也讨厌那褶皱的布料总是不断地以令人窒息的方式盖住她的嘴巴。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You'll get used to it," Rasheed said. "With time, I bet you'll even like it."</div>

<div class="line_en">They took a bus to a place Rasheed called the Shar-e-Nau Park, where children pushed each other on swings and slapped volleyballs over ragged nets tied to tree trunks. They strolled together and watched boys fly kites, Mariam walking beside Rasheed, tripping now and then on the burqa's hem. For lunch, Rasheed took her to eat in a small kebab house near a mosque he called the Haji Yaghoub. The floor was sticky and the air smoky. The walls smelled faintly of raw meat and the music, which Rasheed described to her as logari, was loud. The cooks were thin boys who fanned skewers with one hand and swatted gnats with the other. Mariam, who had never been inside a restaurant, found it odd at first to sit in a crowded room with so many strangers, to lift her burqa to put morsels of food into her mouth. A hint of the same anxiety as the day at the tandoor stirred in her stomach, but Rasheed's presence was of some comfort, and, after a while, she did not mind so much the music, the smoke, even the people. And the burqa, she learned to her surprise, was also comforting. It was like a one-way window. Inside it, she was an observer, buffered from the scrutinizing eyes of strangers. She no longer worried that people knew, with a single glance, all the shameful secrets of her past.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们乘坐公共汽车去一个地方，拉希德说那儿叫沙里诺公园。一些孩子在公园里荡秋千，把排球拍过几张系在树上的破烂球网。他们一起散步，看男孩们放风筝。玛丽雅姆走在拉希德身边，时不时踩到布卡的裙边。中午时分，拉希德带她去一家小小的烤肉店吃饭；烤肉店附近有一座清真寺，他管它叫哈吉雅霍。烤肉店的地板脏兮兮，空气弥漫着烟雾。墙壁散发出一股淡淡的生肉味道，音乐放得很响，拉希德说它是用一种叫洛戈里[1]的乐器伴奏的。厨师是几个瘦弱的男孩，他们一只手给烤肉串煽火，一只手猛拍小虫子。玛丽雅姆从未到过饭店，开始的时候，她觉得和这么多陌生人在一个拥挤的房间里坐在一起真古怪，把布卡抬起，一小口、一小口地吃东西也很奇怪。她有点担心会碰到前一天在烤炉前发生的情况，但拉希德的在场多少带来了一些宽慰；没隔多久，她已经不介意这么吵的音乐，这么呛的烟雾，甚至也不害怕有这么多的人。而且，出乎她意料的是，布卡也让她安心。它就像一面只能看出不能看进的窗户。在这面窗户之内，她是一个旁观者，陌生人评头品足的眼光统统被挡住了。她再也不担心人们一眼就能看穿她过去所有那些耻辱的秘密。【注：[1]Logari，一种类似吉他的阿富汗民族乐器。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On the streets, Rasheed named various buildings with authority; this is the American Embassy, he said, that the Foreign Ministry. He pointed to cars, said their names and where they were made: Soviet Volgas, American Chevrolets, German Opels.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在街道上，拉希德准确地说出各座建筑物的名字；这是美国大使馆，他说，那是外交部。他指着一些轿车，说出它们的名字和出产地：苏联的伏尔加，美国的雪佛兰，德国的欧宝。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">From a street vendor, Rasheed bought her ice cream. It was the first time she'd eaten ice cream and Mariam had never imagined that such tricks could be played on a palate. She devoured the entire bowl, the crushed-pistachio topping, the tiny rice noodles at the bottom. She marveled at the bewitching texture, the lapping sweetness of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拉希德在马路边的一个小摊给她买了冰淇淋。这是玛丽雅姆第一次吃冰淇淋，她从未想像到人世间竟有如此美味的东西。她把整个冰淇淋都吃下去了，包括上面撒的碎开心果，还有底部那些细小的米线。她对冰淇淋迷人的口感和香甜惊奇不已。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Kabul was far more crowded than the little that Mariam had seen of Herat. There were fewer trees and fewer garis pulled by horses, but more cars, taller buildings, more traffic lights and more paved roads. And everywhere Mariam heard the city's peculiar dialect: "Dear" was jan instead of jo, "sister" became hamshira instead of hamshireh, and so on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="比起玛丽雅姆曾在赫拉特街头见过的那点景象来说，喀布尔的街头热闹多了。这儿的树比较少，骡马拉的车也更少，但是轿车、高楼、红绿灯和铺了石板的人行道都比赫拉特多。无论走到哪里，玛丽雅姆都能听到这座城市特有的方言，和赫拉特的方言稍微有点区别。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The street was lined with shops and little stalls that sold lambskin hats and rainbow-colored chapans.

<div class="line_cn" title="街道两旁都是店铺和小摊，出售羊皮毛和五颜六色的长袍。拉希德在一间店铺停下来，观看一把雕花的银匕首，又在另外一间看了看一把来复枪，店主信誓旦旦地跟拉希德说那是第一次抗英战争[2]时遗留下来的枪支。【注：[2]指1838～1842年的第一次英阿战争。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They strolled past carpet shops, handicraft shops, pastry shops, flower shops, and shops that sold suits for men and dresses for women, and, in them, behind lace curtains, Mariam saw young girls sewing buttons and ironing collars. From time to time, Rasheed greeted a shopkeeper he knew, sometimes in Farsi, other times in Pashto. As they shook hands and kissed on the cheek, Mariam stood a few feet away. Rasheed did not wave her over, did not introduce her.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="但最吸引玛丽雅姆注意的还是女人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mariam waited outside on the crowded sidewalk. She watched the cars crawling up Chicken Street, threading through the horde of hawkers and pedestrians, honking at children and donkeys who wouldn't move. She watched the bored-looking merchants inside their tiny stalls, smoking, or spitting into brass spittoons, their faces emerging from the shadows now and then to peddle textiles and fur-collared poostin coats to passersby.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽雅姆在外面拥挤的人行道上等他。她看着那些轿车慢慢驶进小鸡街道，在兜售东西的小贩和行人之间蜿蜒前进，朝那些没有及时让路的小孩和毛驴鸣喇叭。她见到那些小摊里面的商人满脸疲惫，或者吞云吐雾，或者朝黄铜痰盂吐痰，他们的脸时不时从阴凉处露出来，向过往行人推销纺织品和皮领大衣。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He asked her to wait outside an embroidery shop. "I know the owner," he said. "I'll just go in for a minute, say my salaam."</div>

<div class="line_en">The women in this part of Kabul were a different breed from the women in the poorer neighborhoods -- like the one where she and Rasheed lived, where so many of the women covered fully. These women were -- what was the word Rasheed had used?—"modern." Yes, modern Afghan women married to modern Afghan men who did not mind that their wives walked among strangers with makeup on their faces and nothing on their heads. Mariam watched them cantering uninhibited down the street, sometimes with a man, sometimes alone, sometimes with rosy-cheeked children who wore shiny shoes and watches with leather bands, who walked bicycles with high-rise handlebars and gold-colored spokes -- unlike the children in Deh-Mazang, who bore sand-fly scars on their cheeks and rolled old bicycle tires with sticks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她和拉希德居住的那片城区比较破落，那儿很多女人的头和脸都蒙得严严实实的，但喀布尔这片城区的女人就不同了。这些女人很——拉希德用过那个词是什么来着？——“现代”。是的，现代的阿富汗女人嫁给现代的阿富汗男人，他们并不介意自己的妻子化了妆，头上什么也没戴，独自行走在一群陌生人之间。玛丽雅姆看着她们无拘无束地沿着街道闲逛，有的身边跟着一个男人，有的单身一人，有的带着脸颊红扑扑的孩子。那些孩子穿着闪亮的皮鞋，戴着皮质表带的手表，踩着有金色轮辐和高高把手的自行车，他们和德马赞区的孩子不一样——后者的脸颊上都是白蛉叮咬出来的伤疤，用棍子滚破旧的自行车轮胎。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a dark maroon silk shawl with beaded fringes and edges embroidered with gold thread.</div>

<div class="line_en">These women were all swinging handbags and rustling skirts. Mariam even spotted one smoking behind the wheel of a car. Their nails were long, polished pink or orange, their lips red as tulips. They walked in high heels, and quickly, as if on perpetually urgent business. They wore dark sunglasses, and, when they breezed by, Mariam caught a whiff of their perfume. She imagined that they all had university degrees, that they worked in office buildings, behind desks of their own, where they typed and smoked and made important telephone calls to important people. These women mystified Mariam. They made her aware of her own lowliness, her plain looks, her lack of aspirations, her ignorance of so many things.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些女人都提着晃来荡去的手提包，穿着沙沙作响的裙子。玛丽雅姆甚至还看到有个开着轿车的女人在吸烟。她们的指甲很长，涂上红色或者橙色，她们的嘴唇红得像郁金香。她们穿着高跟鞋，永远步履匆匆，好像有什么急事。她们戴着黑色的太阳镜，每当她们一阵风似的从身边走过，玛丽雅姆还能闻到她们的香水味。在她的想像中，这些女人全都念过大学，在写字楼上班，在属于她们自己的办公桌后面打字、吸烟，打重要的电话给重要的人物。玛丽雅姆觉得这些女人很神秘。她们让她意识到自己出身寒微、姿色平庸、胸无大志、知识贫乏。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mariam thought of Jalil, of the emphatic, jovial way in which he'd pushed his jewelry at her, the overpowering cheerfulness that left room for no response but meek gratitude. Nana had been right about Jalil's gifts. They had been halfhearted tokens of penance, insincere, corrupt gestures meant more for his own appeasement than hers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽雅姆想起了扎里勒，想起了他把珠宝送给她时那副喜形于色的样子。他总是兴高采烈，让她除了温顺地表示感谢之外，再也无法作出别的回应。关于扎里勒的礼物，娜娜说的没错。它们都是并非真心实意的礼物，而是一些赎罪的象征，一些虚伪的、无耻的姿态，与其说是为了让她快乐，毋宁说是为了使他自己心安理得。">查看中文翻译</div>
