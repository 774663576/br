<div class="line_en">"Now, concerning this post of warden," he began, "of course you know the income would be very much reduced. In addition, you would be expected to have the house painted inside every seven years and outside every three years. And the duties -- well, I believe, if I am correctly informed, there were hardly any duties to speak of in the past." He gave a scornful laugh. "Things are a great deal changed, not only in Barchester, Mr Harding, but also in the wider world. Work is now required from every man who receives wages, and new men are needed in the Church, as in other professions. For example, the bishop is anxious to have a Sunday school attached to the Hospital, for the children of the poor, and the teachers would be under your control and care."</div>

<div class="line_en">Two days later Mr Harding was called to the palace to discuss the wardenship of Hiram's Hospital with Mr Slope.

<div class="line_en">He went first to Eleanor's house, to tell her his troubles, but found that Mr Slope had visited her the day before. The chaplain had made a very different speech to her from the one he had made to her father, full of flattery and heartfelt hopes that Mr Harding would take the wardenship.

<div class="line_en">Now Mr Harding had something else to worry about. To have as a son-in-law, the husband of his favourite child, the only man in the world whom he really disliked, would be a misfortune he felt he could not bear. In fact, if the truth were known, Eleanor had no more idea of marrying Mr Slope than of marrying the bishop. But it was true she had forgiven him his sermon, his pride, and even his shiny face and oily manners, so in time might she not accept him as an admirer? Strangely enough, Mr Slope was innocent of the crime he was being accused of. This man whose eyes were generally so wide open to everything around him had not yet discovered that the young widow was rich as well as beautiful. It was an error which he was soon to correct.</div>

<div class="line_en">Francis Arabin was an old Oxford friend of Dr Grantly's, a clergyman of the highest reputation, and also a gentleman. He and Mr Slope had been carrying on a long battle on spiritual matters in the letters pages of The Jupiter for some months now, and Dr Grantly thought his friend's intelligence and deep religious knowledge would be extremely useful in the fight against the Proudies. Mr Arabin had therefore been offered, and had accepted, the post of vicar of a small church near Plumstead. Dr Grantly was delighted that Arabin would be so near at hand, for advice and support, and amused that Mr Slope would come face to face with his spiritual enemy very soon.</div>

<div class="line_en">And so the matter was arranged between them. Dr Grantly's good humour continued till bedtime, when, in the privacy of their room, Mrs Grantly gave him her opinion of what Eleanor might do. His face looked stern, and he said, "If she does, I'll never speak to her again. I won't be connected to such dirt as that," and he gave a shudder which shook the whole room.</div>

<div class="line_en">"The bishop has no power to appoint a new man as warden, or indeed to make the warden a Sunday school teacher! All of Barchester expects you to return to Hiram's Hospital, and that's what you will do. I tell you what, my friend, I shall see the bishop when he has neither his wife nor his chaplain beside him, and I think you'll find the matter will end with you becoming warden without any conditions whatever.

<div class="line_en">Mr Slope lost no time in visiting Mr Quiverful to ask if he would like to be warden of the Hospital. Mr Quiverful, in giving his enthusiastic reply, happened to mention that Mr Harding might not need the post because his daughter Eleanor had an income of a thousand a year. This unexpected information caused Mr Slope to cut short his visit, and he rode home, thinking hard. Why should he not marry the widow, and make the thousand pounds a year his own? And then it struck him that perhaps it would be easier to gain her approval, if he did all in his power to help her father become warden, instead of Quiverful.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯洛普先生一刻也没耽搁，就去拜访了奎沃夫先生，问他愿不愿意担任养老院院长。奎沃夫先生给出了热情的回答，还顺口提了一句，哈丁先生可能不需要这个职位，因为他女儿埃莉诺每年有一千英镑的收入。这始料未及的信息让斯洛普先生提早告辞。骑马回家的路上，他冥思苦想。自己干吗不娶了这个寡妇，把那一千英镑的年收入据为己有呢？他突然想到，如果自己竭尽所能帮助她父亲而不是奎沃夫当上院长，可能会更容易赢得她的芳心。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He was confident he could manage this, although it would involve a complete change of direction, but he knew he must step cautiously. If he quarrelled with the Proudies and was then refused by the widow, he would have lost all his influence and power. He also remembered that Mrs Bold's brother-in-law was his enemy, the archdeacon, and swore he would never bow the knee to that man, not even for a thousand pounds a year.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管需要彻底扭转事态的发展方向，他还是相信自己能把这件事情办妥，但他清楚自己必须谨慎行事。要是这边跟普劳蒂夫妇起了争执，那边又遭到寡妇拒绝，他的影响力和权势会荡然无存。他还想了起来，博尔德太太那个当执事长的姐夫是他的敌人，于是暗自发誓，哪怕是为了一千英镑的年收入也绝不向此人屈膝。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Another circumstance influenced him. The vision of the signora was continually before his eyes. It would be too much to say Mr Slope was lost in love, but yet he thought he had never seen so beautiful a woman.

<div class="line_en">The chaplain then went on to call on Eleanor Bold, who was playing with baby Johnny in her sitting room. When Mr Slope was announced, Eleanor quickly pushed back her long dark hair, which the baby had pulled down from her widow's cap. Mr Slope stopped for a moment in the doorway, realizing at once how lovely she was, and thinking that, even if she had no fortune at all, she would bring comfort and joy to any man's home.</div>

Eleanor moved her head slightly; it looked more like a shake than a nod, but Mr Slope took no notice of it. "To you I can speak openly, and express the feelings of my heart. When I spoke to your father about the post of warden, he gave me the impression he would refuse it, and so the bishop, perhaps mistakenly, has offered it to Mr Quiverful."</div>

She had no suspicion that Mr Slope was planning to court her; nor did she notice how much time he spent at the signora's side, or even the guilty looks he sent in her direction. For most of the evening she was left alone with Bertie, and the time simply flew by. Bertie did not flatter her, or sigh like a lover, but he was amusing and friendly, yet at the same time respectful.
