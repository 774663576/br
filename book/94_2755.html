<div class="line_en">In Miamas you celebrate Christmas the evening before, just like in Sweden, but it's because that's when the Christmas tales are told. All tales are regarded as treasures in Miamas, but the Christmas tales are something truly special. A normal story can either be funny or sad or exciting or scary or dramatic or sentimental, but a Christmas tale has to be all those things. "A Christmas tale has to be written with every pen you own," Granny used to say. And they have to have happy endings, which is something that Elsa has decided completely on her own.</div>

Granny was full of nonsense, of course, but Elsa went along with it, because she likes pizza and Christmas food kind of sucks if you're a vegetarian.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她下楼时怀念起披萨的香味。外婆说，在密阿玛斯，圣诞节吃披萨是一条法律。这显然是外婆的瞎话，但爱莎还是随她去了。因为她喜欢披萨，而对一名素食主义者来说，圣诞食物其实很糟糕。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The pizza also had the added bonus of making a cooking smell in the stairwell that drove Britt-Marie into a fury. Because Britt-Marie hangs Christmas decorations on her and Ken's front door, because Kent's children always come for Christmas and Britt-Marie wants to "make the stairs look nice for everyone!" And then the Christmas decorations smell of pizza all year, which provokes Britt-Marie and makes her condemn Granny as "uncivilized."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="还有一个好处，烤披萨的香味蔓延到整个楼道，这让布里特—玛丽特别生气。布里特—玛丽会在她和肯特的家门前挂上圣诞装饰，因为肯特的孩子们会来过圣诞，而布里特—玛丽想“让每个人都觉得楼梯看上去很漂亮”。她的圣诞装饰整年都会闻上去有股披萨味儿，这惹怒了布里特—玛丽，因而她宣称外婆“未经文明教化”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"As if THAT old bat can talk about being uncivilized?! No one is more damned civilized than I am!" Granny would snort every year while she sneaked about, as was the tradition, hanging little pieces of calzone all over Britt-Marie's Christmas decorations. And when Britt-Marie appeared at Mum and George's flat on Christmas Eve morning in such a foul mood, in that way of hers, that she said everything twice, Granny defended herself by saying that they were "pizza Christmas decorations" and that Granny actually just wanted to "make things look nice for everyone!" On one occasion she actually dropped the whole calzone through Britt-Marie and Kent's mail slot, and then Britt-Marie got so angry on Christmas morning that she forgot to put on her floral-print jacket.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那个老女人自以为知道什么是‘文明教化’？没人比我更讲文明了！”外婆总会不屑地评论。作为一项传统，她每年都会偷偷把小块的面饼挂到布里特—玛丽的圣诞装饰上。当布里特—玛丽在圣诞节早上暴躁地出现在妈妈和乔治的门前时，她每句话都要说两遍。外婆辩解说那些是“披萨圣诞装饰”，而她只是想“让每个人都觉得这些很漂亮”。有一次，她甚至把整张面饼从布里特—玛丽和肯特的投信口里塞了进去。那个圣诞节早晨，布里特—玛丽气得都忘记穿她的印花外套了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But Elsa can't say no to Mum right now, because Mum, after a lot of nagging, has agreed to let the wurse hide in Granny's flat over Christmas. It's quite difficult saying no to a mum who lets you bring a wurse home, even if Mum still sighs about Elsa "exaggerating" when Elsa says Kent is trying to kill it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但现在爱莎不能跟妈妈说不，因为妈妈终于没抵挡住女儿的软磨硬泡，同意让呜嘶在圣诞节期间藏在外婆的公寓里。当爱莎说肯特还想杀了它时，妈妈叹着气说这是“夸大其词”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Elsa takes a couple of deep, controlled breaths on the stairs, because that's what Mum has told her to do when she gets angry. Mum really does everything that Granny never did. Such as asking Elsa to invite Britt-Marie and Kent for Christmas dinner with all the other neighbors, for example. Granny would never have done that. "Over my dead body!" Granny would have roared if Mum had suggested it. Which she couldn't have done now that her body was actually dead, Elsa realizes, but still. It's about the principle. That's what Granny would have said if she'd been here.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱莎在楼梯上深吸了几口气来稳定情绪，妈妈告诉她生气时要这样做。妈妈真的总是做外婆从不做的事情。比如让爱莎邀请布里特—玛丽、肯特和其他所有邻居一起吃圣诞晚餐。外婆绝不会这么做。“除非我死了！”如果妈妈提出这样的建议，外婆一定会冲她这么吼。她现在做不到了，因为她的确已经死了，爱莎意识到这点。但不管怎么说，这是原则问题。外婆如果在这里，她就会那么说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On the other hand, Elsa is happy that the wurse took an instant dislike to George. Not that Elsa feels anyone should hate George, but really no one ever has, so it's nice just for a change.</div>

<div class="line_en">Elsa knows they're talking about Granny's flat being easier to defend if Sam comes here. She knows that Sam will come sooner or later, and that Mum is going to assemble Granny's army on the top floor. Elsa was in Lennart and Maud's flat with the wurse when Mum told Maud to just "pack the essentials" and tried to sound as if it wasn't at all serious. And then Maud and the wurse packed all the cookie tins they could find into big bags, and when Mum saw that she sighed and said: "Please, Maud, I said just the essentials!" And then Maud looked at Mum in a puzzled way and replied: "Cookies are the essentials."</div>

Elsa knows that because she played hide-the-key with the boy all afternoon while Mum, George, Alf, Lennart, Maud, and the boy's mother sat in the kitchen talking about secrets. They deny it, of course, but Elsa knows how secretive voices sound. You know that when you're almost eight. She hates that Mum has secrets from her. When you know someone is keeping secrets from you it makes you feel like an idiot, and no one likes feeling like an idiot. Mum of all people should know that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="生病男孩和他妈妈将搬到外婆的公寓里。爱莎下午和男孩玩“藏钥匙”游戏时，妈妈、乔治、阿尔夫、莱纳特、莫德和男孩的妈妈坐在厨房里说悄悄话。他们当然对此表示否认，但爱莎知道悄悄话听上去是什么样子的。当你即将八岁时，你就会知道。她讨厌妈妈有秘密瞒着她。有人瞒着你秘密时，你会觉得自己被当成了白痴，没人喜欢被当成个白痴。妈妈应该最清楚这点。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Although Britt-Marie and Kent's door is full of Christmas decorations, no one answers when Elsa rings the doorbell. She finds Britt-Marie in the corridor downstairs, just inside the entrance. She stands with her hands clasped together on her stomach, staring disconsolately at the stroller, which is still locked to the banister. She's wearing the floral-print jacket and the brooch. And there's a new notice on the wall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然布里特—玛丽和肯特的门前挂满了圣诞装饰，但爱莎按门铃时，没人应答。她发现布里特—玛丽在楼下的走廊，就站在大门内侧。她双手叠放在腹部，愁苦地盯着那辆婴儿车，它还锁在栏杆上。她穿着印花外套，戴着胸针。墙上有一张新告示。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The wurse growled happily at that statement, then looked at Mum as if it was more disappointed than angry and pointedly pushed an extra tin of chocolate and peanut cookies into the bag. Then they carried it all upstairs to Granny's flat and George invited everyone for mulled wine. The wurse drank the most mulled wine of them all. And now all the grown-ups are sitting in Mum and George's kitchen, having secrets together.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="呜嘶听见这话，开心地低吼了一声，然后用失望而不是生气的眼神看着妈妈，示威地将另一罐巧克力花生饼干推进袋子里。然后他们把这些都带上楼，去了外婆的公寓，乔治请大家喝香料热红酒。呜嘶把所有的酒全喝光了。现在，所有的大人都坐在妈妈和乔治的厨房里，说着悄悄话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="爱莎不太清楚当时自己心里在想些什么，但也许就是“不是傻瓜”和“背后说坏话”这两句话结合而产生的。爱莎的喉咙里涌出一种不悦、酸涩、恶臭的感觉，花了很长时间，她才极不情愿地承认，那是同情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I suppose you find this funny," she starts, "you and your family. Making the rest of us look foolish in this house.

It's actually a fire risk to have strollers in the stairwell and to keep taping up notices on the walls! The paper can actually start burning!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你是不是觉得这很有趣？”她说，“你和你那一家子，让我们其他住在楼里的人看上去像傻瓜。但我一定会查清楚到底是谁干的，我向你保证。在楼梯井放置婴儿车，还有在墙上贴告示，这些都是火灾隐患！纸有可能烧起来的！”">查看中文翻译</div>

Elsa wonders if he's waiting for the real Santa, who isn't made of chocolate. Obviously, Elsa doesn't believe in Santa, but she has a lot of faith in people who do believe in him. She used to write letters to Santa every Christmas, not just wish lists but whole letters. They weren't very much about Christmas, mainly about politics. Because Elsa mostly felt that Santa wasn't involving himself enough in social questions, and believed he needed to be informed about that, in the midst of the floods of greedy letters that she knew he must be receiving from all the other children every year. Someone had to take a bit of responsibility. One year she'd seen the Coca-Cola ad, and that time her letter was quite a lot about how Santa was a "soulless sellout." Another year she'd seen a TV documentary about child labor and, immediately after that, quite a few American Christmas comedies, and because she was unsure whether Santa's definition of "elf" should be classified as the same as the elves that exist in Old Norse mythology or the ones that live in forests in Tolkien's world, or just in the general sense of a short person, sort of thing, she demanded that Santa immediately get back to her with a precise definition.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mum didn't laugh at all about that, which didn't bother Granny, but on the other hand Elsa did laugh a good deal, and that pleased Granny immeasurably. And the day before Christmas, Elsa had a letter from Santa in which he gave her a right ticking-off because she'd "got herself an attitude," and then there followed a long haranguing passage that started with "you ungrateful bloody brat" and went on to say that because Elsa had stopped believing in Santa, the elves hadn't been able to reach a proper collective agreement on salaries that year.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="妈妈没有因此大笑，外婆也不在意。爱莎倒是笑了好半天，这让外婆乐坏了。那年圣诞的前一天，爱莎收到了圣诞老人的一封信，信上好好地责备了一番爱莎，因为她“态度不好”，然后是一长段高谈阔论，开始于“你这个不知好歹的小混蛋”，紧接着说因为爱莎不再相信圣诞老人，所以小精灵们今年“对公资不满了”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Santa never did, so Elsa sent another letter that was very long and angry. The year after, Elsa had learned how to use Google, so then she knew the reason for Santa never answering was that he didn't exist. So she didn't write any more letters. She mentioned to Mum and Granny the next day that Santa didn't exist, and Mum got so upset that she choked on her mulled wine, and when Granny saw this she immediately turned dramatically to Elsa and pretended to be even more upset, and burst out: "DON'T you talk like that, Elsa! If you do, you're just reality-challenged!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="圣诞老人没有回复，所以爱莎又写了另一封充满愤怒的长信。第二年，爱莎学会了如何用谷歌，她终于知道圣诞老人不回信的原因是他根本不存在。于是她再也不写信了。第二天她对妈妈和外婆说圣诞老人不存在时，妈妈沮丧得被香料热红酒给呛到了，外婆见状立马做作地转向爱莎，装作更沮丧的样子，大吼道：“不要这么说，爱莎！你这是在歪曲事实！”">查看中文翻译</div>

When the boy catches sight of a bowl of chocolate Santas and disappears from view, Elsa slips into the flat's front hall, opens the chest in there, and pulls out the Santa suit. She goes back onto the landing and presses it into Alf's arms.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱莎看了看男孩，又看向阿尔夫，双眼紧锁在他身上。趁着男孩看见一碗巧克力兔子而跑进公寓时，爱莎溜进玄关，打开那里的箱子，找出圣诞老人装。她回到楼梯，把它按在阿尔夫的怀里。">查看中文翻译</div>

Granny went around all day telling fairy tales to children with terrible diseases and Elsa followed behind her, distributing toys. That was Elsa's best-ever Christmas. They would make a tradition of it, Granny promised, but it was a really crappy tradition because they only had time to do it one year before she went and died.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后来，外婆气呼呼地拿出她新买的圣诞老人装，她们去了外婆朋友工作的儿童医院。外婆在那儿待了一整天，给得了重病的孩子们讲故事，爱莎则跟在她身后分发玩具。那是爱莎度过的最棒的圣诞节。外婆保证，她们会把这个当作传统，年年都做，然而这个传统很烂，因为她们才遵循了一年，外婆就死了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Alf squints at Elsa. Then he reluctantly mutters that that's true enough. Because Maud really couldn't keep a secret even if it was glued to the insides of her hands. While George was playing hide-the-key with Elsa and the boy with a syndrome earlier, Maud had walked behind them and repeatedly whispered, "Maybe you should look in the flowerpot in the bookshelf," and when Elsa's mum explained to Maud that the whole point of the game was sort of to find out for yourself where the key was hidden, Maud looked disconsolate and said, "The children look so sad while they're searching, I don't want them to be sad."</div>
