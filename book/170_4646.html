<div class="line_en">"I do not like this place," Haldon Halfmaester muttered. "Frightened of a little fog?" mocked Tyrion, though in truth there was quite a lot of fog. At the prow of the Shy Maid, Young Griff stood with the third pole, to push them away from hazards as they loomed up through the mists. The lanterns had been lit fore and aft, but the fog was so thick that all the dwarf could see from amidships was a light floating out ahead of him and another following behind. His own task was to tend the brazier and make certain that the fire did not go out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我真心对这个地方没好感，”‘半学士’哈尔顿嘀咕。“怕一场小雾？”提利昂嘲笑，但是其实那是很大一场雾。在害羞小姐号的穿透，小格里夫站在第三个撑杆边，将在雾霭中摸索的众人推离危险。船首船尾都点着灯笼但是雾实在太浓以至于站在船中央的侏儒只能隐隐看到一点光亮漂浮在前面而后面一点光亮的追随。他的任务是照顾火盆确保不会熄灭。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Septa Lemore was praying. The mists muffled the sound of her voice, making it seem small and hushed. Griff paced the deck, mail clinking softly beneath his wolfskin cloak. From time to time he touched his sword, as if to make certain that it still hung at his side. Rolly Duckfield was pushing at the starboard pole, Yandry at the larboard. Ysilla had the tiller.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="修女莱莫尔在祈祷，浓雾掩盖了她的声音让它听起来细小安静。格里夫在甲板上踱步，铠甲在他狼皮斗篷下轻轻碰撞。不时的他会摸一摸他的剑好像想确定它是不是还好好挂在腰间。洛里·达克菲尔德则推着右舷的撑杆，杨恩德里在左舷，伊西拉掌舵。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"This is no common fog, Hugor Hill," Ysilla insisted. "It stinks of sorcery, as you would know if you had a nose to smell it. Many a voyager has been lost here, poleboats and pirates and great river galleys too. They wander forlorn through the mists, searching for a sun they cannot find until madness or hunger claim their lives. There are restless spirits in the air here and tormented souls below the water."</div>

<div class="line_en">"There's one now," said Tyrion. Off to starboard a hand large enough to crush the boat was reaching up from the murky depths. Only the tops of two fingers broke the river's surface, but as the Shy Maid eased on past he could see the rest of the hand rippling below the water and a pale face looking up. Though his tone was light, he was uneasy. This was a bad place, rank with despair and death. Ysilla is not wrong. This fog is not natural. Something foul grew in the waters here, and festered in the air. Small wonder the stone men go mad.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“现在又来了，”提利昂说。在右舷边一只足以捏碎穿体的巨手从浊浪深处伸出。只有它的两个手指头露出了水面，但是缓慢漂过它旁边的害羞小姐号还是能看到手的其他部分在水下被扭曲，而后有一张苍白的巨脸注视。但是提利昂的语调并不愉快而他也不太自在，这是个不祥的地方，与死亡和绝望相伴。伊西拉没说错，这种浓雾绝非自然产生，有些灵魂在水中滋生，在空气中腐化。这也不奇怪石人们都疯了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Hatred does not stir the stone men half so much as hunger." Haldon Halfmaester had wrapped a yellow scarf around his mouth and nose, muffling his voice.

<div class="line_en">The only way not to breathe the fog is not to breathe. "Garin's Curse is only greyscale," said Tyrion. The curse was oft seen in children, especially in damp, cold climes. The afflicted flesh stiffened, calcified, and cracked, though the dwarf had read that greyscale's progress could be stayed by limes, mustard poultices, and scalding-hot baths (the maesters said) or by prayer, sacrifice, and fasting (the septons insisted). Then the disease passed, leaving its young victims disfigured but alive. Maesters and sep-tons alike agreed that children marked by greyscale could never be touched by the rarer mortal form of the affliction, nor by its terrible swift cousin, the grey plague. "Damp is said to be the culprit," he said. "Foul humors in the air. Not curses."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="唯一不吸入这些雾的方法就是别呼吸。“加林的诅咒只是灰死病而已，”提利昂说。那种诅咒在孩童身上比较常见，尤其是潮湿寒冷的气候里。那些痛苦的肉体逐渐僵硬，钙化然后碎裂，虽然侏儒读过关于灰死病可以被控制：用酸橙、芥末膏、滚水浴（这是学士说的）或者祈祷，献祭和斋戒（修士们的论调）。接着病魔就会消退，让那个年轻的受害者毫无人形的生存。学士和修士们都认为被灰死病标记过的孩童不会再被别的世间灾祸困扰，也不会被它恐怖迅猛的表兄灰瘟侵害。“潮湿被归咎于罪魁祸首，”他说。“空气中的肮脏液体。不是什么诅咒。”">查看中文翻译</div>

"The men of Volantis and Valyria hung Garin in a golden cage and made mock as he called upon his Mother to destroy them. But in the night the waters rose and drowned them, and from that day to this they have not rested. They are down there still beneath the water, they who were once the lords of fire. Their cold breath rises from the murk to make these fogs, and their flesh has turned as stony as their hearts."</div>

A wooden keep could be seen beside the water, rotted and overgrown. Slender spires took form above it, some of them snapped off like broken spears. Roofless towers appeared and disappeared, thrusting blindly upward. Halls and galleries drifted past: graceful buttresses, delicate arches, fluted columns, terraces and bowers.</div>

There were gardens bright with flowers and fountains sparkling golden in the sun. These steps once rang to the sound of lovers' footsteps, and beneath that broken dome marriages beyond count were sealed with a kiss. His thoughts turned to Tysha, who had so briefly been his lady wife. It was Jaime, he thought, despairing. He was my own blood, my big strong brother. When I was small he brought me toys, barrel hoops and blocks and a carved wooden lion. He gave me my first pony and taught me how to ride him. When he said that he had bought you for me, I never doubted him. Why would I? He was Jaime, and you were just some girl who'd played a part. I had feared it from the start, from the moment you first smiled at me and let me touch your hand. My own father could not love me. Why would you if not for gold?</div>

<div class="line_en">Stone eyes are blind eyes, thought Tyrion. The mortal form of greyscale began in the extremities, he knew: a tingling in a fingertip, a toenail turning black, a loss of feeling. As the numbness crept into the hand, or stole past the foot and up the leg, the flesh stiffened and grew cold and the victim's skin took on a greyish hue, resembling stone. He had heard it said that there were three good cures for greyscale: axe and sword and cleaver. Hacking off afflicted parts did sometimes stop the spread of the disease, Tyrion knew, but not always. Many a man had sacrificed one arm or foot, only to find the other going grey. Once that happened, hope was gone. Blindness was common when the stone reached the face. In the final stages the curse turned inward, to muscles, bones, and inner organs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="石化的眼睛是瞎的，提利昂想。他知道，灰死病致命的脚步开始于尖端：手指尖先会发麻，脚趾头变黑并且失去知觉。接着麻木感顺着手开始延伸，或者从足部开始侵蚀腿部，血肉逐渐变硬变冷接着受害者的皮肤染成了类似于石头的灰色。他听说过三种治愈灰死病的方法：斧头、剑或者屠刀。砍掉感染的部位有时的确会阻止疾病的蔓延，提利昂知道，但是例外来的少。许多人牺牲了一条手臂或者一只脚结果却发现其他的地方变灰了。一旦如此，希望泯灭。当石化蔓延至脸部时，失明常常接踵而至。到了最后阶段，诅咒侵入体内，肌肉，骨骼和内脏在劫难逃。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ahead of them, the bridge grew larger. The Bridge of Dream, Griff called it, but this dream was smashed and broken. Pale stone arches marched off into the fog, reaching from the Palace of Sorrow to the river's western bank. Half of them had collapsed, pulled down by the weight of the grey moss that draped them and the thick black vines that snaked upward from the water. The broad wooden span of the bridge had rotted through, but some of the lamps that lined the way were still aglow. As the Shy Maid drew closer, Tyrion could see the shapes of stone men moving in the light, shuffling aimlessly around the lamps like slow grey moths. Some were naked, others clad in shrouds.</div>

Forty feet above, the stone men moaned and muttered beneath a flickering lamp. Most took no more notice of the Shy Maid than of a drifting log. Tyrion clutched his torch tighter and found that he was holding his breath. And then they were beneath the bridge, white walls heavy with curtains of grey fungus looming to either side, water foaming angrily around them.

A trickle of moisture ran down his spine and made him shudder. The Sorrows drifted by them.

<div class="line_en">Griff was on the second man the instant he shambled down off the cabin roof. With a sword in his right hand and a torch in his left, he drove the creature backwards. As the current swept the Shy Maid beneath the bridge, their shifting shadows danced upon the mossy walls. When the stone man moved aft, Duck blocked his way, pole in hand. When he went forward, Haldon Halfmaester waved a second torch at him and drove him back. He had no choice but to come straight at Griff. The captain slid aside, his blade flashing. A spark flew where the steel bit into the stone man's calcified grey flesh, but his arm tumbled to the deck all the same. Griff kicked the limb aside. Yandry and Duck had come up with their poles. Together they forced the creature over the side and into the black waters of the Rhoyne.</div>

<div class="line_en">The leap had shattered one of his legs, and a jagged piece of pale bone jutted out through the rotted cloth of his breeches and the grey meat beneath. The broken bone was speckled with brown blood, but still he lurched forward, reaching for Young Griff. His hand was grey and stiff, but blood oozed between his knuckles as he tried to close his fingers to grasp. The boy stood staring, as still as if he too were made of stone. His hand was on his sword hilt, but he seemed to have forgotten why.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="之前的条约弄碎了他的双腿，有一块苍白粗糙的骨头自他臀部的破烂衣衫下的灰色肉体中刺出。断骨上粘着褐色的血斑但是他依旧蹒跚向前，直指小格里夫。他的手又灰又硬，但当他试图握拳紧抓时血从他的关节里渗出。男孩一动不动的站着，仅仅想石头似的盯着他看。他的手依旧按着剑柄但是他似乎忘掉了他这么做的目的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tyrion kicked the lad's leg out from under him and leapt over him when he fell, thrusting his torch into the stone man's face to send him stumbling backwards on his shattered leg, flailing at the flames with stiff grey hands. The dwarf waddled after him, slashing with the torch, jabbing it at the stone man's eyes. A little farther. Back, one more step, another. They were at the edge of the deck when the creature rushed him, grabbed the torch, and ripped it from his hands. Bugger me, thought Tyrion.</div>

<div class="line_en">The stone man flung the torch away. There was a soft hiss as the black waters quenched the flames. The stone man howled. He had been a Summer Islander, before; his jaw and half his cheek had turned to stone, but his skin was black as midnight where it was not grey. Where he had grasped the torch, his skin had cracked and split. Blood was seeping from his knuckles though he did not seem to feel it. That was some small mercy, Tyrion supposed. Though mortal, greyscale was supposedly not painful.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="石人将火炬扔到一边，当黑水碰到火焰时发出了轻微的嘶嘶声。石人咆哮了。他曾是个盛夏群岛人；他的下巴和半边脸颊都已经石化，但是他的皮肤没变灰的地方是如夜的黑色。他刚刚抓住火炬的皮肤开始分崩离析。血从他的关节中渗出但是他看起来并没什么感觉。这得算是点小小的仁慈了，提利昂想。虽然致死，但是灰死病据称并不疼痛。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The sudden cold hit Tyrion like a hammer. As he sank he felt a stone hand fumbling at his face. Another closed around his arm, dragging him down into darkness. Blind, his nose full of river, choking, sinking, he kicked and twisted and fought to pry the clutching fingers off his arm, but the stone fingers were unyielding. Air bubbled from his lips. The world was black and growing blacker. He could not breathe.</div>

It was only his revenant who remained, the small vengeful ghost who throttled Shae and put a cross-bow bolt through the great Lord Tywin's bowels. No man would mourn the thing that he'd become.
