<div class="line_en">I've been lackadaisical since I was a kid. When I lived at boarding school, I never washed the dishes or made the bed. I never got excited about anything. Too lazy to study, too lazy to even play, I dawdled my way through the days without any clear goals. But I knew that I had some special talents others lacked. For example, if you drew a line, I could always draw another line that would divide it into the golden ratio: 1.618. My classmates told me that I should be a carpenter, but I thought it was more than that, a kind of intuition about numbers and shapes. But my math grades were just as bad as my grades in other classes. I was too lazy to bother showing my work. On tests, I just wrote out my guesses as answers. I got them right about eighty to ninety percent of the time, but I still got mediocre scores.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我是个懒散的人，从小就是，住校时碗从来不洗．被子从来不叠，对什么都提不起兴趣，懒得学习，甚至懒得玩，每天迷迷糊糊地混日子。但我知道自己有一些超过常人的才能，比如你画一根线，我在线上划一道，位置肯定在0.618的黄金分割处。同学们说我适合当木匠，但我觉得这是更高级的才能，是对数和形的一种直觉。其实我的数学同其他课程一样，成绩一团糟，我懒得推导，考试时就将自己蒙出来的答案直接写上去，也能蒙对百分之八九十，但这样拿不到高分。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">My teacher took out a book, The Collected Cases of Sherlock Holmes. He turned to one story -- "A Study in Scarlet," I think. There's a scene in it where Watson sees a plainly dressed messenger downstairs and points him out to Holmes. Holmes says, "Oh, you mean the retired sergeant of marines?" Watson is amazed by how Holmes could deduce the man's history, but Holmes can't articulate his reasoning and has to think for a while to figure out his chain of deductions. It was based on the man's hand, his movements, and so on. He tells Watson that there is nothing strange about this: Most people would have difficulty explaining how they know two and two make four.</div>

<div class="line_en">When I was a second-year student in high school, a math teacher noticed me. Back then, many high school teachers had impressive academic credentials, because during the Cultural Revolution many talented scholars ended up teaching in high schools. My teacher was like that. One day, he kept me after class. He wrote out a dozen or so numerical sequences on the blackboard and asked me to write out the summation formula for each. I wrote out the formulas for some of them almost instantaneously and could tell at a glance that the rest of them were divergent.</div>

"But people like you don't cherish your gift." After thinking for a while, he seemed to give up, saying, "Why don't you sign up for the district math competition next month? I'm not going to tutor you. I'd just be wasting my time with your sort. But when you give your answers, make sure to write out your derivations." So I went to the competition.

<div class="line_en">Oh, I didn't go to become a monk. Too lazy for that. I just wanted to find a truly peaceful place to live for a while. The abbot there was my father's old friend -- very intellectual, but became a monk in his old age. The way my father told it, at his level, this was about the only way out. The abbot asked me to stay. I told him, "I want to find a peaceful, easy way to just muddle through the rest of my life." The abbot said, "This place isn't really peaceful. There are lots of tourists, and many pilgrims too. The truly peaceful can find peace in a bustling city. And to attain that state, you need to empty yourself." I said, "I'm empty enough. Fame and fortune are nothing to me. Many of the monks in this temple are worldlier than me." The abbot shook his head and said, "No, emptiness is not nothingness. Emptiness is a type of existence. You must use this existential emptiness to fill yourself." His words were very enlightening to me. Later, after I thought about it a bit, I realized that it wasn't Buddhist philosophy at all, but was more akin to some modern physics theories. The abbot also told me he wasn't going to discuss Buddhism with me. His reason was the same as my high school teacher's: With my sort, he'd just be wasting his time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哦，我不是去出家，我懒得出家，只是想找个真正清静的地方住一阵儿。那里的长老是我父亲的一个老友，学问很深，却在晚年遁入空门，照父亲说吧，到他这层次，也就这一条路了。那位长老收留我住下，我对他说，想找个清静省心的方式混完这辈子算了。长老说，这里并不清静，是旅游区，进香的人也很多；大隐隐于市，要清静省心，自己就得空。我说我够空了，名利于我连浮云都算不上，你庙里那些僧人都比我有更多的凡心。长老摇摇头：空不是无，空是一种存在，你得用空这种存在填满自己。这话对我很有启发，后来想想，这根本不是佛家理念，倒像现代的某种物理学理论。长老也说了，他不会同我谈佛，理由与那位中学老师一样：对我这号人没用。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">You're not bored by my talking all this time? Ah, good. Well, to make sense of what happened later, I have to tell you all this. That high school math teacher was right. I didn't cherish my talent. Bachelor's, master's, Ph. D.-- I never put much effort into any of them, but I did manage to get through them all. However, once I graduated and went back to the real world, I realized that I was completely useless. Other than math, I knew nothing. I was half asleep when it came to the complexities of relationships between people. The longer I worked, the worse my career. Eventually I became a lecturer at a college, but I couldn't survive there either. I just couldn't take teaching seriously. I'd write on the blackboard, "easy to prove," and my students would still struggle for a long while. Later, when they began to eliminate the worst teachers, I was fired. By then I was sick of everything. I packed a bag and went to a Buddhist temple deep in the mountains somewhere in southern China.</div>

<div class="line_en">So I created a sphere in this infinite space for myself: not too big, though possessing mass. My mental state didn't improve, however. The sphere floated in the middle of "emptiness"-- in infinite space, anywhere could be the middle. The universe had nothing that could act on it, and it could act on nothing. It hung there, never moving, never changing, like a perfect interpretation for death.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是我给自己在这无限的空间中创造了一个球体，不大的、有质量的球体。但感觉并没有好起来，那球体悬浮在“空”的正中（对于无限的空间，任何一处都是正中），那个宇宙中没有任何东西作用于它，它也没有任何东西可以作用。它悬在那里，永远不会做丝毫的运动，永远不会有丝毫的变化，真是对死亡最到位的诠释。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That first night, I couldn't sleep in the tiny room in the temple. I didn't realize that this refuge from the world would be so uncomfortable. My blanket and sheet both became damp in the mountain fog, and the bed was so hard. In order to make myself sleep, I tried to follow the abbot's advice and fill myself with "emptiness." In my mind, the first "emptiness" I created was the infinity of space. There was nothing in it, not even light. But soon I knew that this empty universe could not make me feel peace. Instead, it filled me with a nameless anxiety, like a drowning man wanting to grab on to anything at hand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第一天晚上，在寺院的小屋里我睡不看，没想到这世外桃源是如此的不舒服，被褥都在山雾中变潮了，床硬邦邦的。于是，为了催眠，我便试图按长老说的那样，用“空”来填充自己：我在意识中创造的第一个“空”是无际的太空，其中什么都没有，连光都没有，空空的。很快觉得这空无一物的宇宙根本不能使自己感到宁静，身处其中反而会感到一种莫名的焦躁不安．有一种落水者想随便抓住些什么东西的欲望。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I created a second sphere whose mass was equal to the first one's. Both had perfectly reflective surfaces. They reflected each other's images, displaying the only existence in the universe other than itself. But the situation didn't improve much. If the spheres had no initial movement -- that is, if I didn't push them at first -- they would be quickly pulled together by their own gravitational attraction. Then the two spheres would stay together and hang there without moving, a symbol for death. If they did have initial movement and didn't collide, then they would revolve around each other under the influence of gravity. No matter what the initial conditions, the revolutions would eventually stabilize and become unchanging: the dance of death.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我创造了第二个球，与原来的球大小质量相等，它们的表面都是全反射的镜面，互相映着对方的像，映着除它自己之外宇宙中唯一的一个存在。但情况并没有好多少：如果球没有初始运动，也就是我的第一推动，它们很快会被各自的引力拉到一块，然后两个球互相靠着悬在那里一动不动，还是一个死亡的符号。如果有初始运动且不相撞，它们就会在各自引力作用下相互围绕着对方旋转，不管你怎样初始化，那旋转最后都会固定下来，永远不变，死亡的舞蹈。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I then introduced a third sphere, and to my astonishment, the situation changed completely. Like I said, any geometric figure turns into numbers in the depths of my mind. The sphereless, one-sphere, and two-sphere universes all showed up as a single equation or a few equations, like a few lonesome leaves in late fall. But this third sphere gave "emptiness" life. The three spheres, given initial movements, went through complex, seemingly never-repeating movements. The descriptive equations rained down in a thunderstorm without end. Just like that, I fell asleep. The three spheres continued to dance in my dream, a patternless, never-repeating dance. Yet, in the depths of my mind, the dance did possess a rhythm; it was just that its period of repetition was infinitely long. This mesmerized me. I wanted to describe the whole period, or at least a part of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我又引入了第三个球体，情况发生了令我震惊的变化。前面说过，任何图形在我的意识深处都是数字化的，前面的无球、一球和二球宇宙表现为一条或寥寥几条描述它的方程，像几片晚秋的落叶。但这第三个球体是点上了“空”之睛的龙，三球宇宙一下子变得复杂起来，三个被赋予了初始运动的球体在太空中进行着复杂的、似乎永不重复的运动，描述方程如暴雨般涌现，无休无止。我就这样进入梦乡，三球在梦中一直舞蹈着，无规律的永不重复的舞蹈。但在我的意识深处，这舞蹈是有节奏的，只是重复的周期无限长而已，这让我着迷，我要描述出这个周期的一部分或全部。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The next day I kept on thinking about the three spheres dancing in "emptiness." My attention had never been so completely engaged. It got to the point where one of the monks asked the abbot whether I was having mental health issues. The abbot laughed and said, "Don't worry. He has found emptiness." Yes, I had found emptiness. Now I could be at peace in a bustling city. Even in the midst of a noisy crowd, my heart would be completely tranquil. For the first time, I enjoyed math. I felt like a libertine who has always fluttered carelessly from one woman to another suddenly finding himself in love. The physics principles behind the three-body problem are very simple.

<div class="line_en">Back then, I thought of one thing: Have you heard of the Monte Carlo method? Ah, it's a computer algorithm often used for calculating the area of irregular shapes. Specifically, the software puts the figure of interest in a figure of known area, such as a circle, and randomly strikes it with many tiny balls, never targeting the same spot twice. After a large number of balls, the proportion of balls that fall within the irregular shape compared to the total number of balls used to hit the circle will yield the area of the shape. Of course, the smaller the balls used, the more accurate the result.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当时我立刻想到了一样东西：你听说过‘蒙特卡洛法’吗？哦，那是一种计算不规则图形面积的计算机程序算法，具体做法是在软件中用大量的小球随机击打那块不规则图形，被击中的地方不再重复打击，这样，达到一定的数量后，图形的所有部分就会都被击中一次，这时统计图形区域内小球的数量，就得到了图形的面积，当然，球越小结果越精确。">查看中文翻译</div>

It's just that the solution contains a greater number of different forms. What's needed is a new algorithm.</div>

<div class="line_en">Although the method is simple, it shows how, mathematically, random brute force can overcome precise logic. It's a numerical approach that uses quantity to derive quality. This is my strategy for solving the three-body problem. I study the system moment by moment. At each moment, the spheres' motion vectors can combine in infinite ways. I treat each combination like a life form. The key is to set up some rules: which combinations of motion vectors are "healthy" and "beneficial," and which combinations are "detrimental" and "harmful."

<div class="line_en">But my evolutionary algorithm has already discovered more than a hundred stable configurations.

<div class="line_en">Compared with the general state of the field, my progress could be said to be a breakthrough. Some years ago, Richard Montgomery of UCSC and Alain Chenciner of Université Paris Diderot discovered another stable, periodic solution to the three-body problem.30 Under appropriate initial conditions, the three bodies will chase each other around a fixed figure-eight curve. After that, everyone was keen to find such special stable configurations, and every discovery was greeted with joy. Only three or four such configurations have been found so far.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="汪淼刚走下车，立刻听到了楼上发出的声音，连着几声，像是什么东西在拍墙。刚下车的大史听到这声音后立刻警觉起来，一脚踹开虚掩着的院门，以与他那壮硕的身躯不相称的敏捷飞速冲进别墅，他的三名同事随后跟进。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Wang and Wei followed them into the house. They went upstairs and entered the room with a light on, their shoes splashing in a pool of blood. Shen lay in the middle of the room, blood still oozing from two bullet wounds in her chest. A third bullet had gone through her left brow, causing her whole face to be covered in red. Not far from her, a gun lay in a crimson pool.</div>
