<div class="line_en">Apparently it was still very early morning. The sun had only just risen, and it had risen out of the forests which he saw low down and far away on his right. The country j which he was looking at was absolutely new to him. It was t a green valley-land dotted with trees through which he caught the gleam of a river that wound away roughly to the North-West. On the far side of the valley there were high and even rocky hills, but they were lower than the mountains he had seen yesterday. Then he began to guess where he was. He turned and looked behind him and saw that the slope on which he was standing belonged to a range of far higher mountains.</div>

<div class="line_en">Shasta stooped and drank -- a very long drink -- and then dipped his face in and splashed his head. It was extremely cold, and clear as glass, and refreshed him very much. After that he stood up, shaking the water out of his ears and flinging the wet hair back from his forehead, and began to take stock of his surroundings.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="沙斯塔俯下身去喝水——喝了好久——然后把脸浸在水里，把水泼在头上。水极冷，清澄如玻璃，他喝了神清气爽。这之后，他站起身来，把耳朵里的水甩掉，把潮湿的头发从前额上撩到后面去，开始观察周围环境。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Was it all a dream?" wondered Shasta. But it couldn't have been a dream for there in the grass before him he saw the deep, large print of the Lion's front right paw. It took one's breath away to think of the weight that could make a footprint like that. But there was something more remarkable than the size about it. As he looked at it, water had already filled the bottom of it. Soon it was full to the brim, and then overflowing, and a little stream was running downhill, past him, over the grass.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这一切是个梦？”沙斯塔心中疑惑。但这不可能是个梦，因为他看到前面草地上有个狮子右前蹄的又深又大的印子，能造成这样的蹄印的重量，想想也叫人透不过气来。但还有比蹄印大小深浅更令人奇怪的事哩。当他瞧着那蹄印时，水已经铺满它的底部了。不多一会儿，水就漫到边上来了，往外溢出来了，一条小小溪水，流过青草，经过他的身边，奔流下山去了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I wish I could eat grass!" thought Shasta. "It's no good going back to Anvard, it'll all be besieged. I'd better get lower down into the valley and see if I can get anything to eat."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我但愿我能吃草啊！”沙斯塔心中想道，”回到安瓦德去毫无用处，这城将被团团围攻。我还不如到下边儿的山谷里去，瞧瞧能否弄到点儿东西吃。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He turned and unsaddled his horse and took off its bridle -- "Though you are a perfectly horrid horse," he said. It took no notice of this remark and immediately began eating grass. That horse had a very low opinion of Shasta.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他再转过身去，给马儿卸下了鞍子，取下了马勒——”尽管你是一匹完全令人厌恶的马儿。”他说道。马儿不理会他的批评，立刻开始吃起青草来了。那马儿对沙斯塔的评价不高。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I see," said Shasta to himself. "Those are the big mountains between Archenland and Narnia. I was on the? other side of them yesterday. I must have come through the pass in the night. What luck that I hit it! -- at least it wasn't luck at all really, it was Him. And now I'm in Narnia."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我明白了，”沙斯塔跟他自己说道，”这些就是介乎阿钦兰和纳尼亚之间的大山大岭。我昨天是在大山的那一边。我必定是在夜间穿过山隘的。我碰巧走对了，运道真好！——实际上，这压根儿不是运道好，这是它帮了大忙。现在我是在纳尼亚境内了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So he went on downhill (the thick dew was cruelly cold to his bare feet) till he came into a wood. There was a kind of track running through it and he had not followed this for many minutes when he heard a thick and rather wheezy voice saying to him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以他就走下山去（浓重的露水，让他的光脚丫子冷极了），一直走进一个树林。有一条踏出来的小路贯穿树林，他沿着这小路走了没有几分钟，就听到一个沙哑而呼哧呼哧的声音同他说话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Shasta looked round eagerly to find the speaker and presently saw a small, prickly person with a dark face who had just come out from among the trees. At least, it was small for a person but very big indeed for a hedgehog, which was what it was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="沙斯塔热切地向四周打量，想要找到说话的人，他立刻看见了刚从树林里出来的一个身材短小、黑脸多刺的人。至少，作为一个人，它是太小了，但作为一只刺猬，却是很大的了：它就是一只刺猬。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“啊？”刺猬询问地说道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The last words were addressed to an immense biscuitcoloured rabbit whose head had just popped up from somewhere beside the path. The Hedgehog immediately told the Rabbit what it had just learned from Shasta. The Rabbit agreed that this was very remarkable news and that somebody ought to tell someone about it with a view to doing something.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后一句话是对一只巨大的淡褐色兔子说的，兔子的脑袋刚从小径旁的地底下突然冒出来。刺猬立刻把它从沙斯塔那里听来的事情告诉兔子。兔子同意这是个惊人的消息，应该有人去告诉别人，以便为此干点儿事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Lion alive!" roared the Dwarf as soon as he had heard the news. "And if that's so, why are we all standing still, chattering? Enemies at Anvard! News must be sent to Cair Paravel at once. The army must be called out. Narnia must go to the aid of King Lune."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“狮子还活着！”小矮人听到消息就大声嚷嚷，”如果真是这么一回事，咱们大家为什么仍旧站着闲谈呢？敌人猛攻安瓦德！必须立刻把消息送到凯尔帕拉维尔去。必须把军队动员起来。纳尼亚必须去支援国王伦恩。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Presently, however, two more practical people arrived in the little wood. One was a Red Dwarf whose name appeared to be Duffle. The other was a stag, a beautiful lordly creature with wide liquid eyes, dappled flanks and legs so thin and graceful that they looked as if you could break them with two fingers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，又有两个小树林里比较实际的居民来了。一个是红色小矮人，名叫德夫尔。另一个是一头牡鹿，一只美丽华贵的生物，眼睛大大的水汪汪的，两胁斑斑点点，两腿又纤细又雅致，看上去仿佛用两个手指就能把那腿折断似的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And so it went on. Every few minutes they were joined by other creatures, some from the branches overhead and some from little underground houses at their feet, till the party consisted of five rabbits, a squirrel, two magpies, a goat-foot faun, and a mouse, who all talked at the same time and all agreed with the Hedgehog. For the truth was that in that golden age when the Witch and the Winter had gone and Peter the High King ruled at Cair Paravel, the smaller woodland people of Narnia were so safe and happy that they were getting a little careless.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是就这样纷纷传开去了。每隔几分钟，就有别的生物参加进来，有的来自头上的树枝，有的来自脚下的地底小屋：这一帮子，终于包含了五只兔子、一只松鼠、两只喜鹊、一个羊脚怪物以及一只耗子，它们大家同时说着话儿，大家都同意刺猬的意见。因为，事情的真相是：在那黄金时代里，女巫和冬天已经被赶走，至尊王彼得治理着凯尔帕拉维尔，纳尼亚较小林地里的居民们是那么安宁和幸福，所以它们有点儿麻痹大意了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">With a great deal' of bustle, muttering reproaches to itself, the Dwarf half led and half supported Shasta at a great speed further into the wood and a little downhill. It was a longer walk than Shasta wanted at that moment and his legs had begun to feel very shaky before they came out from the trees on to bare hillside. There they found a little house with a smoking chimney and an open door, and as they came to the doorway Duffle called out,</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小矮人大大的一阵忙乱，喃喃地责备着自己，半搀半扶地赶快把沙斯塔带进树林，稍稍走下山去一点儿。走的这段路比沙斯塔此刻所愿意走的要长得多，他们还没有走出树林，还没有到达光秃秃的山坡上，他已经开始感觉到两腿在发抖了。他们在山坡上找到一个小屋子，烟囱里在冒烟，门户洞开，当他们来到门口时，德夫尔喊道：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And immediately, mixed with a sizzling sound, there came to Shasta a simply delightful smell. It was one he had never smelled in his life before, but I hope you have. It was, in fact, the smell of bacon and eggs and mushrooms all frying in a pan.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伴随着咝咝的油炸之声，立刻向沙斯塔飘来了令人垂涎欲滴的香味。这是一种他生平从未闻到过的香味，但我希望你是闻到过的。事实上，这是咸猪肉、鸡蛋和蘑菇在锅里油炸的香味。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Mind your head, lad," said Duffle a moment too late, for Shasta had already bashed his forehead against the low lintel of the door. "Now," continued the Dwarf, "sit you down. The table's a bit low for you, but then the stool's low too. That's right. And here's porridge -- and here's a jug of cream -- and here's a spoon."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“留神你的脑袋，孩子。”德夫尔说得晚了一点儿，因为沙斯塔的前额已经撞在低低的门楣上了。”现在，”小矮人继续说道，”你坐下吧。对于你，桌子是低了一点儿，凳子也低了一点儿。这就行了。这儿是粥——这儿是壶奶油——这儿是个调羹。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">By the time Shasta had finished his porridge, the Dwarf's two brothers (whose names were Rogin and Bricklethumb) were putting the dish of bacon and eggs and mushrooms, and the coffee pot and the hot milk, and the toast, on the table.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="沙斯塔喝完粥时，小矮人的两个兄弟（他们叫罗金和布里克尔森姆）正在把咸猪肉、鸡蛋和蘑菇，以及咖啡壶、热牛奶和吐司放到桌子上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was all new and wonderful to Shasta for Calormene food is quite different. He didn't even know what the slices of brown stuff were, for he had never seen toast before. He didn't know what the yellow soft thing they smeared on the toast was, because in Calormen you nearly always get oil instead of butter. And the house itself was quite different from the dark, frowsty, fish-smelling but of Arsheesh and from the pillared and carpeted halls in the palaces of Tashbaan. The roof was very low, and everything was made of wood, and there was a cuckoo-clock and a red-and-white checked table-cloth and a bowl of wild flowers and little curtains on the thick-paned windows. It was also rather troublesome having to use dwarf cups and plates and knives and forks. This meant that helpings were very small, but then there were a great many helpings, so that Shasta's plate or cup was being filled every moment, and every moment the Dwarfs themselves were saying, "Butter please", or "Another cup of coffee," or "I'd like a few more mushrooms," or "What about frying another egg or so?" And when at last they had all eaten as much as they possibly could the three Dwarfs drew lots for who would do the washing-up, and Rogin was the unlucky one. Then Duffle and Bricklethumb took Shasta outside to a bench which ran against the cottage wall, and they all stretched out their legs and gave a great sigh of contentment and the two Dwarfs lit their pipes. The dew was off the grass now and the sun was warm; indeed, if there hadn't been a light breeze, it would have been too hot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对沙斯塔来说，这顿早餐全然是新奇的、了不起的，因为卡乐门的食物是完全不同的。他甚至不知道这一片片棕色的东西是什么玩意儿，因为他以前从未见过吐司。他不知道涂在吐司上的黄色柔软的东西是什么玩意儿，因为在卡乐门几乎总是用油来代替白脱的。而这屋子本身也跟阿什伊什黑暗、霉臭、鱼腥的小屋不同，跟塔什班城王宫里圆柱耸立、毯子铺地的大厅截然不同。屋顶很低，一切都是木头做的，有一只以杜鹃叫声报时的钟，一块红白格子台布，一碗野花，厚玻璃窗上还挂着小小的白色窗帘。不得不用小矮人的杯子、盘子、刀叉，也是很麻烦的事。这意味着每份食品都很少，却又有许多份，所以沙斯塔的盘子或是杯子，时时刻刻都在重新添盛，而小矮人们自己也时时刻刻在说：”请来点儿白脱”，”再来一杯咖啡”，或是”我再要些蘑菇”，或是”再来一份煎鸡蛋好吗？”最后，当大家尽量吃饱以后，三个小矮人便拈阄决定由谁洗盘子，结果是罗金倒霉。于是德夫尔和布里克尔森姆便领沙斯塔到屋子外的一条长凳上坐下，那长凳靠着小屋的墙垣；于是他们大家都伸直了腿，心满意足地吁出一口气来，两个小矮人还点上了烟斗。现在青草上的露水不见了，太阳是温暖的，确实，如果没有一阵阵清风的话，天气就会显得太热了“">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The trumpets sounded again: a new noise to Shasta, not huge and solemn like the horns of Tashbaan nor gay and merry like King Lune's hunting horn, but clear and sharp and valiant. The noise was coming from the woods to the East, and soon there was a noise of horse-hoofs mixed with it. A moment later the head of the column came into sight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="喇叭声又响起来了：对沙斯塔说来，的确是个崭新的声音，既不像塔什班城的号角那么洪亮庄重，又不像国王伦恩的狩猎号角那么轻快欢乐，却清晰、尖厉、豪迈。喇叭声是从树林传到东边来的，不久又有马蹄嘚嘚声同喇叭声混合在一起。一会儿之后，纵队的先锋就看得见了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">First came the Lord Peridan on a bay horse carrying the great banner of Narnia -- a red lion on a green ground. Shasta knew him at once. Then came three people riding abreast, two on great chargers and one on a pony. The two on the chargers were King Edmund and a fair-haired lady with a very merry face who wore a helmet and a mail shirt and carried a bow across her shoulder and a quiver full of arrows at her side. ("The Queen Lucy," whispered Duffle.) But the one on the pony was Corin. After that came the main body of the army: men on ordinary horses, men on Talking Horses (who didn't mind being ridden on proper occasions, as when Narnia went to war), centaurs, stern, hard-bitten bears, great Talking Dogs, and last of all six giants. For there are good giants in Narnia. But though he knew they were on the right side Shasta at first could hardly bear to look at them; there are some things that take a lot of getting used to.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="走在第一个的是珀里丹勋爵，骑一匹栗色马，手执纳尼亚大旗——青绿底色上一头红狮子。沙斯塔立刻认出他来了。接着是三个并驾齐驱的人，两个人跨着战马，一个人骑着马驹子。骑在战马上的一个是爱德蒙国王，另一个是金发女郎，满脸兴高采烈的神色，头戴头盔，身穿锁子甲，肩上背着一只弓，身边挂着装满箭的箭袋。（“露茜女王。”德夫尔低声说道。）骑在马驹子上的是科林。这三人之后，是军队的主体：骑在寻常马儿身上的士卒、骑在会说人话的马儿身上的军人（遇到正当情况，例如纳尼亚要作战时，这种马儿并不在意被人骑）、人头马、咬起来凶狠的板着脸的熊、了不得的会说人话的狗，最后是六个巨人。然而，尽管他知道他们是站在正义一边的，沙斯塔开头还是不大敢看他们：有些事情要经过很多时间才能看得惯哩。">查看中文翻译</div>
