<div class="line_en">The preserved duck eggs were served as an hors d'oeuvre in a fashionable Hong Kong restaurant, sliced in half, with a ginger-and-vinegar dip. It was my first trip to Asia, and I had rarely seen anything so revolting on a dinner table. They leered up at me like the eyeballs of some nightmarish monster, dark and threatening. Their albumens were a filthy, translucent brown, their yolks an oozy black, ringed with a layer of greenish, mouldy grey. About them hung a faintly sulphurous haze. I tried one, just to be polite, but its noxious aroma made me feel nauseous and I found it hard to swallow. Afterwards, a slick of toxic black slime from the yolk clung to my chopsticks, threatening to pollute everything else I ate. Surreptitiously, I tried to wipe them on the tablecloth.</div>

<div class="line_en">My food explorations had begun at an early age. I was brought up in a household that was always filled with exotic flavours. My mother taught English as a foreign language in Oxford, and when I was small, her students -- among them Turks, Sudanese, Iranians, Sicilians, Colombians, Libyans and Japanese -- often took over our kitchen to cook up feasts that reminded them of home. Our Japanese au pair girl made riceballs for my sister and me for breakfast, and our Spanish au pair boy telephoned his mother for the details of her famous paella. As for my mother, she cooked curries she'd been taught by my unofficial Hindu godfather, Vijay, while my father experimented with surrealist dishes like purple mashed potatoes with green scrambled eggs. When my Austrian grandfather visited, he prepared recipes he'd learned during his time as a wartime commando in Burma and Ceylon. At a time when most English people were living on toad in the hole, corned-beef hash and macaroni cheese, we were eating hummus, lentil curry, cacik and caponata. I certainly wasn't the kind of girl who would blanch at the sight of a snail or a kidney.</div>

<div class="line_en">Yet Chinese food was something different. Of course I'd had the occasional Chinese takeaway as a child, deep-fried pork balls served with a bright-red sweet-and-sour sauce, chicken with bamboo shoots and egg-fried rice. Later, I had visited a few Chinese restaurants in London. But nothing had prepared me for the gastronomic assaults of that first trip to Hong Kong and China in the autumn of 1992.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但中国菜还是很不一样。小时候我当然也偶尔吃过中餐外卖：油炸猪肉丸子配上鲜红的酸甜酱，还有冬笋炒鸡肉、蛋炒饭之类的。后来，我也去过伦敦的几家中餐馆。但是一九九二年秋天，我第一次去中国，落脚香港，面前的这道菜还是叫我猝不及防。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I went there because of my job. I was working in the Monitoring department of the BBC, sub-editing news reports from the Asia-Pacific region. After a few months of immersion in the strange, twilight world of Chinese politics, I had decided I wanted to see the country for myself, and Hong Kong, where I had a few friends, was my first port of call. I was immediately drawn to the food. Sebastian, who was working in the territory as a graphic designer, showed me around the wet markets of Wanchai on Hong Kong Island. Other expatriate friends took me out to restaurants and ordered their favourite dishes. There were many delightful surprises: exquisite roast goose, sparklingly fresh seafood and myriad delicate dim sum dumplings. Even the cheapest and most nondescript restaurants served stir-fries and soups more delicious than any I had tasted in England, and the sheer variety of the food on offer was dazzling. But I was also faced with many new ingredients that I found disconcerting -- or disgusting.</div>

<div class="line_en">Soon after that dinner with Sebastian and his friends, I crossed the border into Mainland China and took the slow train to Guangzhou. There I visited the notorious Qingping market, where badgers, cats and tapirs languished in cages in the meat section, and the medicine stalls displayed sacks filled with dried snakes and lizards, scorpions and flies. For dinner, I was offered 'roasted piggy', frog casserole and stir-fried snake, its flesh still edged in reptilian skin. Some of these things -- such as that stir-fried snake -- turned out to be unexpectedly palatable. Others, like the loathsome preserved duck eggs (or 'thousand-year-old eggs' as they are called in the West), had tastes or textures that made my flesh crawl.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="和塞巴斯蒂安他们吃完那顿饭后不久，我过了口岸，进入内地，从火车站搭了列慢车去广州。我去了“臭名昭著”的清平市场，肉类那片区域的笼子里关着獾、猫、貘等动物，它们的样子都相当痛苦。药材摊上摆着一麻袋一麻袋晒干的蛇、蜥蜴、蝎子和苍蝇。晚饭给我上了牛蛙干锅和爆炒蛇肉，肉边上还留着一点皮，能看出是个爬行动物。有些菜还真是出乎意料的美味，比如那道爆炒蛇肉。有的嘛，就像那道恶心的皮蛋（西方人称之为“千年老蛋”），无论味道还是口感，都让我全身发麻。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But I have never been one to turn down a taste of something new. Although in some ways I'm a cautious person, I have a streak of recklessness that tends to land me regularly in situations outside my zone of comfort. By the time I reached China, I had travelled widely in Europe and Turkey, and I was used to being shocked and challenged. My parents had also brought me up to eat whatever I was offered, in that polite English way, and it would have seemed unforgiveably rude to leave anything in my ricebowl in China, even if it had six legs or a sulphurous aroma. So from the beginning of that first trip, almost without thinking about it, I braced myself to eat whatever the Chinese might put in front of me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而我从来不是拒绝品尝新口味的人。某些方面来说我算是比较谨慎，但也经常会鲁莽冲动，让自己陷入从前没怎么遇到过的情况。去中国之前，我已经遍访欧洲（包括土耳其），震惊和挑战都算是家常便饭了。从小爸妈养我，就是给什么吃什么，而且总教育我要做一个礼貌的英国人。所以，在中国，要是我的饭碗里剩下了什么，简直是不可原谅，就算那菜有六条腿或者硫磺一样的味道。所以，在这个国家，初来乍到的我从一开始就几乎不假思索地吃下中国人摆在我面前的任何东西。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Since the first European merchants and missionaries began recording their impressions of life in China, foreigners have been astounded by the Chinese diet. In the late thirteenth century, Marco Polo noted with distaste that Chinese people liked eating snakes and dogs and even, in some places, he claimed, human flesh. The French Jesuit historian Jean-Baptiste du Halde adopted a tone of wonder in his description of the exotic Chinese diet in 1736: 'Stags-Pizzles… Bears-Paws… nay they do not scruple eating Cats, Rats, and such like animals.' Chinese banquets have always been a cause for trepidation for outsiders because of the use of shark's fin, sea cucumbers and other rubbery delicacies, and because so many of the ingredients are simply unrecognisable. The British surgeon C. Toogood Downing, writing in the nineteenth century, described British sailors in the trading port of Guangzhou picking carefully at their food, 'lest they should detect themselves in the act of devouring an earthworm, or picking the delicate bones of a cat.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过去来到中国的那些欧洲商人和传教士记录下了他们的中国生活和印象。在这些最初的记录里，外国人就开始表达对中国菜的震惊了。十三世纪末，马可·波罗不无厌恶地写道，中国人喜欢吃蛇肉和狗肉。他还宣称，有些地方会吃人肉。一七三六年，法国耶稣会历史学家杜赫德（3）描述奇异的中国菜，用的则是一种“世界真奇妙”的口吻：“鹿鞭……熊掌……他们吃起猫啊、老鼠啊之类的动物，也是毫不犹豫。”中国的宴会总会让初来乍到的外国人觉得惊恐，因为有鱼翅、海参和别的看着跟橡胶一样的“佳肴”，还因为很多食材佐料根本就认不出来。十九世纪，英国外科医生图古德·唐宁就写了英国水手在广州的通商港口歇脚，吃个饭也得小心翼翼地挑来挑去，“免得不知不觉就吃了条蚯蚓，或者啃着猫儿小小的骨头”。【注：（3）全名是让·巴普蒂斯特·杜赫德（Jean Baptiste du Halde）。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Nearly two centuries later, in the early twenty-first century, Chinese food has become part of the fabric of British and American life. In Britain, even the smallest towns have Chinese restaurants; supermarket shelves are lined with Chinese ready meals and stir-fry sauces; and 65 per cent of British households now own a wok. In 2002, Chinese food even overtook Indian as the country's favourite 'ethnic' cuisine. Yet still a dark, muscular fear of the unknown lurks beneath the surface. In a notorious article published in 2002 under the headline 'Chop Phooey!', the Daily Mail denounced Chinese food as 'the dodgiest in the world, created by a nation that eats bats, snakes, monkeys, bears' paws, birds' nests, sharks' fins, ducks' tongues and chickens' feet.' Echoing the fears of the early European travellers, it said you could never be sure what the 'oozing Day-Glo foodstuff balanced between your chopsticks' actually was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="将近两个世纪过去了，现在已是二十一世纪初，中国菜早已渗透进了英美人的日常生活。英国最小的城镇也有中国餐馆。超市的货架上摆满了中国的方便速食餐和炒菜配料。如今的英国，百分之六十五的家庭都有一口中华炒锅。二零零二年，中国菜甚至超越印度菜，成为全英国最爱的“民族”菜。然而，大受欢迎的表象之下，仍然暗藏着未知产生的强烈恐惧。同样是二零零二年，英国销量极大的报纸《每日邮报》刊登了一篇题为“呸！切个屁！”的著名文章，公开抨击中国菜，说“（中国菜是）全世界最具有欺骗性的。做中国菜的中国人，会吃蝙蝠、蛇、猴子、熊掌、燕窝、鱼翅、鸭舌和鸡爪”。这篇文章里表达的情绪，恰好应和了最初那些去中国的欧洲旅行者的恐惧，说你永远没法确定“筷子上夹着的那黏糊糊的荧光色的东西”到底是什么。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There is nothing the British press prefers to publish or, apparently, the public to read, than a juicy story about a Chinese restaurant serving dog hotpot or penis stew. These disgusting delicacies seem to exert an irresistible pull. A story about a penis restaurant in Beijing was one of the most popular on the BBC news website for a long period in 2006. The following year, British television broadcast a four-part series about the comedian Paul Merton's travels in China. One of the aspects of Chinese culture the series covered was food, and what delicacies did they feature? Dog meat and penises! Seven centuries after Marco Polo wrote about the Chinese penchant for dog, nearly three centuries after Du Halde exclaimed at stags' pizzles, Westerners remain fixated, obsessed even, with the weird fringes of Chinese gastronomy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="英国媒体最爱刊登这种故事，显然读者也是喜闻乐见。总有文章绘声绘色地描述中国餐馆里有狗肉火锅啊、炖牛羊鹿鞭啊什么的。这些令人恶心的“美味佳肴”似乎有股不可抗拒的力量。二零零六年，BBC（英国广播公司）新闻网上，一篇关于北京“锅里壮”鞭锅鞭菜餐厅的报道，长时间占据着最受欢迎文章的地位。第二年，英国的电视上播出了喜剧演员保罗·莫顿游中国的四集系列片，涉及中国文化的方方面面，饮食当然是其中之一。那么他们去拍了什么菜呢？狗肉和鞭锅啊！离马可·波罗写中国人嗜吃狗肉已经七个世纪了，离杜赫德对着鹿鞭惊叹已经将近三个世纪了，西方人还是对中国美食中这些怪异的元素念念不忘，甚至有点走火入魔了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Chinese communities have, on the whole, been strangely silent in the face of these disparaging stereotypes. Perhaps it's because they see 'eating everything' as unremarkable. Although a typical Chinese meal consists largely of grains, pork and vegetables, with a bit of fish or seafood thrown in, depending on the region, there is little that can't be considered a potential ingredient. Most people eat dog meat and donkey penis rarely, if at all, but there is no taboo in China about the idea of eating them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="面对这些充满毁谤意味的成见，中国人整体上保持了惊人的沉默。可能是因为他们觉得“啥都吃”本来就是见惯不惊的小事情。虽然中国普通家庭常吃的饭菜也基本上就是主食、猪肉和蔬菜，根据地方的不同可能来个鱼或者海鲜。但在中国人的概念里，很少有东西不能拿来作食材的。其实吃狗肉、驴鞭的人很少，从来没吃过的大有人在。不过从观念上来说，吃这些东西也不是什么禁忌。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Chinese don't generally divide the animal world into the separate realms of pets and edible creatures: unless you are a strict Buddhist (and bearing in mind certain regional preferences), you might as well eat them all. Likewise, there is no conceptual divide between 'meat' and 'inedible rubbery bits' when butchering an animal carcass: in China they traditionally favour the kind of nose-to-tail eating of which restaurateur Fergus Henderson, the notorious English purveyor of offal, could only dream. As the poet Christopher Isherwood memorably wrote during his travels in China in the late 1930s: 'Nothing is specifically either eatable or uneatable. You could begin munching a hat, or bite a mouthful out of a wall; equally you could build a hut with the food provided at lunch.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="传统上，中国人不会把动物分成“宠物”和“可食用的动物”，除非你是很虔诚的佛教徒（不同区域也可能会有地方性的好恶），不然会觉得什么动物都能吃。同样的，在宰杀动物的时候，也不会从概念上区分“肉”和“咬不动不能吃的部分”。中国人从古至今都比较喜欢头、身子、尾巴连着一起吃，这种吃法就连英国那个特别爱做内脏的著名主厨弗格斯·亨德森也只能望尘莫及。二十世纪三十年代末，诗人克里斯多夫·伊舍伍在中国旅行时，夸张地记录了难忘的经历：“没有什么东西具体地归类为能吃或者不能吃。你可能会嚼着一顶帽子，或者咬下一口墙；同样的，你也可以用午饭时吃的食材盖个小屋。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For me, the height of Chinese omnivorousness is to be found in a cookery book written by a chef and restaurateur I know from Hunan Province. It is a nice-looking, full-colour book that cheerfully enacts the worst nightmares of every foreigner who might be squeamish about Chinese food. The heads and feet of various fowl loll over the rims of soup tureens and serving dishes. Ten fishheads peer up out of a 'sea' of mashed beancurd and eggwhite, their open mouths stuffed with fishballs made from their own cooked flesh. Eleven lizards have been partially skinned and then deep-fried, so their bodies, golden and crisp like chicken nuggets, are sandwiched between scaly tails and heads in which the ruined eyeballs have been replaced by fresh green peas. One grand platter holds ten whole turtles which look as though they might wake up and shuffle away at any moment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对我来说，中国这种杂食性特色最鲜明的体现，是一本烹饪书，作者是我在湖南认识的一位厨师兼餐馆老板。书是全彩页的，装帧很不错，欢欣愉悦、图文并茂地展示了每个外国人最糟糕的噩梦，都是些可能让他们一看便呕吐不止的中国菜。各种各样禽类的头和爪懒洋洋地靠在汤锅边缘或者菜盘子上。捣碎的豆腐和蛋白汇成一片“海”，十个鱼头从里面诡异地探出来，嘴巴张着，里面含着鱼丸，用的就是它们自己的鱼肉。十一只蛤蚧（大壁虎）被剥了部分的皮后下锅炸，身体炸得金黄酥脆，像炸鸡块，一头一尾的鳞还保留着，眼珠子被掏出来换成了新鲜的青豆。还有个巨大的盘子上趴着十只完整的鳖，感觉随时可能醒过来，窸窸窣窣地爬走。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My favourite photograph in the book depicts a whippy egg-white pudding decorated with maraschino cherries and chocolate sprinkles. How unfortunate, I thought, that it has been photographed in such a way that the sprinkles look like ants -- until I peered at the small print and discovered the 'pudding' was in fact sprinkled with ants, which, the notes say, are good for dispelling rheumatism. And then, on page forty-five, the pièce de résistance, a whole puppy, roasted crisp, splayed out on a plate after having been attacked with a cleaver, so its skull is split in half, an eye and a nostril on each side, served with an elegant garnish of coriander, and flowers made from pink radish. Could any racist cartoonist have created a better stereotype of the disgustingly omnivorous Chinese?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="书里我最喜欢的一张图片，是一碗软软的蛋白布丁上装饰着酒渍樱桃、撒着巧克力碎片。看到这图片的时候我心想，哎，真遗憾，拍得不好，那些巧克力碎片看着跟蚂蚁似的。结果我仔细看了看下面小小的说明文字，发现这道“布丁”的大名叫“雪山神蜉”，上面撒的还真是蚂蚁，还备注说有祛风湿、通经络之功效。书的第四十五页介绍了一道很隆重的大菜，整只的乳狗，烤得外焦里嫩，前后腿儿趴开在一个大盘子上。它之前先被刀劈过，头骨被砍成两半，一边一只眼睛、一个鼻孔，旁边装饰着香菜和小红萝卜雕的花，摆得挺好看的。还有哪位带种族偏见的漫画家能用更好的画面来说明中国这些“杂食人种”有多恶心吗？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That first visit of mine to China in 1992 was a revelation. The country was so vibrant and disorganised, so unlike the monochrome, totalitarian place I'd been expecting -- those indelible images of crowds in Mao suits brandishing Little Red Books. Through train windows I gazed out at vivid landscapes of rice paddies and fish ponds, where farmers worked and water buffalo grazed. I visited an incredible circus in Guangzhou where people put snakes up their noses and danced barefoot on broken glass. I cycled along the beautiful Li River near Guilin; and discussed the Cultural Revolution with a group of elderly political delegates on a passenger ship sailing through the Three Gorges of the Yangtze River. I was charmed and enthralled by almost everything I saw. Back in London, I enrolled in evening classes in Mandarin and started writing quarterly round-ups of Chinese news for the magazine China Now. I even began to experiment with a few Chinese recipes, from Yan-Kit So's Classic Chinese Cookbook. All this was just the beginning of a fascination with China that would take over my life. And as my involvement with China gained pace, so did my explorations of Chinese food.</div>

<div class="line_en">It is not an easy thing for a traveller to go completely native in her tastes. What we eat is an essential part of who we are and how we define ourselves. Keeping up cultural traditions when abroad is no trivial matter; it is a deeply felt way of protecting ourselves from the threat of the unknown. We take holiday vaccinations to shield our bodies from the risk of invasion by foreign diseases; similarly, we may eat familiar foods while abroad to shield ourselves from the threat of exposure to different cultures. It wasn't just for their amusement that the British colonialists who lived in Asia in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries dressed for dinner and drank cocktails every evening. They knew that if they didn't, they risked losing themselves, like those English eccentrics in India who threw themselves so wholeheartedly into the local culture that they forgot where they really belonged.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="旅行在异邦，要完全适应当地口味并不容易。我们吃的东西，代表了我们做人和自我认知非常核心的一部分。保持自己的文化传统也不是一件小事，而是一种自我保护的手段，让我免受未知事物的威胁。我们外出度假时会接种疫苗，免得在国外染上什么病；类似的，在国外我们也可能只吃自己熟悉的食物，免得陌生的文化猝不及防地暴露在眼前。十九世纪末和二十世纪初，身在亚洲的英国殖民者晚餐时会换上正式的礼服，每晚还要喝鸡尾酒，这不仅是为了消遣。他们知道，要是不这么做，就会有迷失自我的风险，就会像驻守印度的那些英国怪人一样全心全意地投入到当地文化中，都忘了自己真正的归属。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the nineteenth century, many of the British residents in Shanghai and the other treaty ports avoided Chinese food as far as possible, living on 'metallic' meals of tinned and bottled foods imported from home. The Anglo-Chinese Cookbook, published in the 1920s (in two volumes, one in English for the mistress, one in Chinese for the cook), lists classic recipes for lobster bisque and pigeon pie, and though it includes some exotic dishes such as 'Hungarian Goulasch' and 'Indian Curry', it makes no mention whatsoever of Chinese cuisine. The authors' fear of the omnivorous Chinese, hovering in the shadows, waiting to pounce, is almost palpable.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="十九世纪，住在上海和其他按照条约开放的港口城市的英国人都对中国菜避之唯恐不及，完全靠从家乡进口来的罐装和瓶装的所谓“金属”餐食活着。二十世纪二十年代出版了一部《英华烹饪学全书》（分两卷，一卷英文，给英国人家的女主人看；一卷中文，给厨子看）。书里有一些经典的菜谱，比如龙虾汤和鸽肉饼。里面也提到了一些异域菜，比如“匈牙利炖菜”和“印度咖喱”，但对中国菜却只字未提。几乎能感觉到这套书的作者们对中国人的恐惧，他们可能觉得，这些“杂食动物”就匍匐在阴影中，随时可能伸着爪子猛扑过来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Somehow, it seems that the more foreign a country, and the more alien the diet of its natives, the more rigidly expatriates living there want to adhere to the rituals of their homelands. It's safer that way. Even now, many of my expatriate European friends in China live largely on European food at home. You take on the food of another country at your peril. Do it, and you inevitably loosen your own cultural moorings, and destabilise your fundamental sense of identity. It's a risky business.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不知为什么，一个国家越陌生，当地人的饮食越怪异，居住在这个国家的外国人就越想要严格地坚持自己故国的规矩。或许这样比较安全。就算是现在，我在中国的很多欧洲朋友也基本上是自己在家做欧洲菜吃。吃别国的菜，是很危险的。一筷子下肚，你就不可避免地失去自己的文化归属、动摇最根本的身份认同。这是多大的冒险呀。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So this is a book about the unexpected wonders of Chinese cuisine. It is also the tale of an English girl who went to China, ate everything, and was sometimes surprised at the consequences.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以，这本书写的就是中国菜带给我的出乎意料和不可思议。故事的主人公是一个英国女孩，去了中国，啥都吃了，后果嘛，有时候还真是令人惊讶呢。">查看中文翻译</div>
