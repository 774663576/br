<div class="line_cn" title="“她是我的婶婶，住在堪萨斯州，我就是从那里来的。”北方的女巫低下了头，眼睛看在地面上，似乎想了一会儿，随后抬起头来说道：“我不知道堪萨斯州在哪里，因为我以前从来没有听说过这个地方。但是请你告诉我，那里是一个文明的地方吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

But, you see, the Land of Oz has never been civilized, for we are cut off from all the rest of the world. Therefore we still have witches and wizards amongst us."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那么就是这个理由了。在文明的地方，我相信都没有女巫留下来，也没有男巫，也没有女魔术家，也没有男魔术家。但是，你得明白，奥芝地方还没有文明起来，因为我们和世界其他各个地方隔离开来了。所以在我们中间，仍旧有女巫和男巫。”">查看中文翻译</div>
