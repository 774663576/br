<div class="line_en">That night, la Esmeralda had fallen asleep in her cell, full of oblivion, of hope, and of sweet thoughts. She had already been asleep for some time, dreaming as always, of Phoebus, when it seemed to her that she heard a noise near her. She slept lightly and uneasily, the sleep of a bird; a mere nothing waked her. She opened her eyes. The night was very dark. Nevertheless, she saw a figure gazing at her through the window; a lamp lighted up this apparition. The moment that the figure saw that la Esmeralda had perceived it, it blew out the lamp. But the young girl had had time to catch a glimpse of it; her eyes closed again with terror.</div>

<div class="line_en">All at once, as she struggled and crawled on the floor, the gypsy's hand came in contact with something cold and metal-lic-it was Quasimodo's whistle. She seized it with a convulsive hope, raised it to her lips and blew with all the strength that she had left. The whistle gave a clear, piercing sound.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她在挣扎中，在地上爬着，忽然手碰着一样东西，冰凉，像是金属的。那是卡席莫多的哨子。她心怀希望，一个抽搐，抓住了哨子，送到嘴边，使尽残余的力气猛然吹响。哨子发出清脆、尖锐刺耳的呼啸。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Nothing came. Djali alone was awake and bleating with anguish.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="什么也没有出现。只有佳利惊醒了，焦急地号叫。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What is that?" said the priest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“怎么回事？”教士说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Hush!" said the panting priest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“别出声！”教士气喘吁吁地说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Almost at the same instant he felt himself raised by a vigorous arm. The cell was dark; he could not distinguish clearly who it was that held him thus; but he heard teeth chattering with rage, and there was just sufficient light scattered among the gloom to allow him to see above his head the blade of a large knife.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几乎就在这一刹那，他觉得自己被一只健壮有力的手臂举了起来。小室里漆黑，他看不清是谁这样揪住了他，但是他听见对方牙齿因狂怒而咬得轧轧响，黑暗中略有星散微光，恰好让他瞥见自己头顶上有一把刀，宽大的刀叶闪闪发亮。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The priest fancied that he perceived the form of Quasimodo. He assumed that it could be no one but he. He remembered to have stumbled, as he entered, over a bundle which was stretched across the door on the outside. But, as the newcomer did not utter a word, he knew not what to think. He flung himself on the arm which held the knife, crying: "Quasimodo!" He forgot, at that moment of distress, that Quasimodo was deaf.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="教士好像看见的是卡席莫多的身影。他猜想只能是他。他想起刚才进来的时候，在门口外面碰着了一个横卧着的什么包袱，几乎绊了一交。但是，既然对方不出一声，他就无法断定。他全身扑向举刀待下的胳臂，叫着：“卡席莫多！”他在这千钧一发的时刻忘记了卡席莫多是个聋子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In a twinkling, the priest was overthrown and a leaden knee rested on his breast.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一眨眼的工夫，教士被扔倒在地，感到一只沉重的膝盖抵着他的胸口。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">From the angular imprint of that knee he recognized Quasimodo; but what was to be done? how could he make the other recognize him? the darkness rendered the deaf man blind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这膝盖给他以多棱多角的印象，他知道这就是卡席莫多。可是，怎么办呢？怎样才能使卡席莫多认出是他呢？黑夜使聋子也成了瞎子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was lost. The young girl, pitiless as an enraged tigress, did not intervene to save him. The knife was approaching his head; the moment was critical. All at once, his adversary seemed stricken with hesitation. "No blood on her!" he said in a dull voice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他算是完了。吉卜赛姑娘毫不怜悯，就跟雌虎暴怒似的。她不想救他。眼看着刀就要向他头上砍下来。真是危急万分。忽然，对方好像犹豫起来，以嘶哑的嗓音说：“不要把血溅到她身上！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The gypsy, who had advanced to the threshold of her cell, beheld with surprise their roles abruptly changed. It was now the priest who menaced, Quasimodo who was the suppliant.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃及姑娘这时也跨出了门槛，十分惊讶地发现两人的地位猝然颠倒了。现在是教士气势汹汹，而卡席莫多直哀告。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was, in fact, Quasimodo's voice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="果真是卡席莫多的嗓音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When they had passed through the door of the cell, its pale rays fell upon the priest's countenance. Quasimodo looked him full in the face, a trembling seized him, and he released the priest and shrank back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们刚刚出了房门，苍白的月光正好落在教士的脸上。卡席莫多直视他细看，一阵哆嗦，放开了教士，往后直退。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then the priest felt a large hand dragging him feet first out of the cell; it was there that he was to die. Fortunately for him, the moon had risen a few moments before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着，教士感觉到一只大手拽住他的脚，把他拖到室外。得叫他在外面去死。算他运气，月亮已经出来一会了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So saying, he presented his knife to the priest. The priest, beside himself, was about to seize it. But the young girl was quicker than be; she wrenched the knife from Quasimodo's hands and burst into a frantic laugh,—"Approach," she said to the priest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说着，他把刀递给教士。教士怒气冲天，向刀扑了过去，可是姑娘比他还快。她一把从卡席莫多手里夺去了刀，狂笑道：“你过来！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The deaf man dropped his head, then he came and knelt at the gypsy's door,—"Monseigneur," he said, in a grave and resigned voice, "you shall do all that you please afterwards, but kill me first."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="聋子低下头去，接着，他跑到埃及姑娘的房门口跪了下来，以顺从然而庄严的声音说：“大人，您愿意怎样您以后再干，您先把我杀掉吧！”">查看中文翻译</div>
