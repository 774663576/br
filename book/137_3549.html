<div class="line_en">Claude Frollo was no longer in Notre-Dame when his adopted son so abruptly cut the fatal web in which the archdeacon and the gypsy were entangled. On returning to the sacristy he had torn off his alb, cope, and stole, had flung all into the hands of the stupefied beadle, had made his escape through the private door of the cloister, had ordered a boatman of the Terrain to transport him to the left bank of the Seine, and had plunged into the hilly streets of the University, not knowing whither he was going, encountering at every step groups of men and women who were hurrying joyously towards the Pont Saint-Michel, in the hope of still arriving in time to see the witch hung there,-- pale, wild, more troubled, more blind and more fierce than a night bird let loose and pursued by a troop of children in broad daylight. He no longer knew where he was, what he thought, or whether he were dreaming. He went forward, walking, running, taking any street at haphazard, making no choice, only urged ever onward away from the Grève, the horrible Grève, which he felt confusedly, to be behind him.</div>

<div class="line_en">In this manner he skirted Mount Sainte-Geneviève, and finally emerged from the town by the Porte Saint-Victor. He continued his flight as long as he could see, when he turned round, the turreted enclosure of the University, and the rare houses of the suburb; but, when, at length, a rise of ground had completely concealed from him that odious Paris, when he could believe himself to be a hundred leagues distant from it, in the fields, in the desert, he halted, and it seemed to him that he breathed more freely.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就这样，他沿着圣日内维埃芙山麓，终于从圣维克多门出了城。只要他扭头还能瞅见大学城的塔楼耸立的城垣和关厢的少数几间房屋，他就不断往前直奔。终于，走下一个坡以后，他完全看不见那狰狞的巴黎，当他自认为已经距离巴黎千百里，到了野外，到了荒漠的地方的时候，他才站住脚步，好像可以呼吸了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then frightful ideas thronged his mind. Once more he could see clearly into his soul, and he shuddered. He thought of that unhappy girl who had destroyed him, and whom he had destroyed. He cast a haggard eye over the double, tortuous way which fate had caused their two destinies to pursue up to their point of intersection, where it had dashed them against each other without mercy. He meditated on the folly of eternal vows, on the vanity of chastity, of science, of religion, of virtue, on the uselessness of God. He plunged to his heart's content in evil thoughts, and in proportion as he sank deeper, he felt a Satanic laugh burst forth within him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，种种使他惊恐的念头一齐涌现在心头。他清清楚楚地审视自己的心灵，不由得一阵哆嗦。他想到那不幸的姑娘，是她毁灭了他，又被他毁灭。他失魂落魄地顾视命运让他们两人各自走过的曲折而并行的道路，直至在交会点上，由于造化的无情播弄，两个命运互相撞击而粉碎。他想，永恒誓愿侍奉上帝是多么疯狂，守身独处是多么无聊，求知、宗教、修身养性尽皆虚空，而上帝又是那样百无一用。他满心舒畅地沉湎于邪恶思想之中，他越沉陷进去，就越清楚地听见灵魂深处撒旦在狞笑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And as he thus sifted his soul to the bottom, when he perceived how large a space nature had prepared there for the passions, he sneered still more bitterly. He stirred up in the depths of his heart all his hatred, all his malevolence; and, with the cold glance of a physician who examines a patient, he recognized the fact that this malevolence was nothing but vitiated love; that love, that source of every virtue in man, turned to horrible things in the heart of a priest, and that a man constituted like himself, in making himself a priest, made himself a demon. Then he laughed frightfully, and suddenly became pale again, when he considered the most sinister side of his fatal passion, of that corrosive, venomous malignant, implacable love, which had ended only in the gibbet for one of them and in hell for the other; condemnation for her, damnation for him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这样深入挖掘自己的心灵，他看见自然天性给了人多么广阔的天地去纵欲贪欢，于是，他更加辛酸地冷笑了。他在自己内心深处翻腾着，抖落出他的全部仇恨、全部邪恶；他以医生诊视病人的冷静眼光，发现原来这种仇恨、这种邪恶，只是污化了的爱欲；他又发现，人的一切美德之源——爱，在教士心中转化为可憎之物，而像他这样气质的人成为教士，也就是变成恶魔。于是，他狞笑了。猝然，他又脸色煞白，因为他看见了他那致命情欲的最阴森的一面：这腐蚀心灵的、恶毒的、丑恶的、冥顽不治的爱，结果只是把一个人送上绞刑台，把另一人送进地狱，她被处决，而他受天谴！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And then his laughter came again, when he reflected that Phoebus was alive; that after all, the captain lived, was gay and happy, had handsomer doublets than ever, and a new mistress whom he was conducting to see the old one hanged. His sneer redoubled its bitterness when he reflected that out of the living beings whose death he had desired, the gypsy, the only creature whom he did not hate, was the only one who had not escaped him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随即，他又冷笑起来，因为想起了孚比斯还活着，毕竟卫队长还活着，活得自在如意，穿的军服比以往更华丽，还有一个新情妇，他带去看绞死旧情妇。他冷笑得更为辛酸：想起了在他迄今必欲处死的人们中间，只有埃及姑娘是他并不仇恨的，然而，正是这唯一的一个，没有逃脱他的打击。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then from the captain, his thought passed to the people, and there came to him a jealousy of an unprecedented sort. He reflected that the people also, the entire populace, had had before their eyes the woman whom he loved exposed almost naked. He writhed his arms with agony as he thought that the woman whose form, caught by him alone in the darkness would have been supreme happiness, had been delivered up in broad daylight at full noonday, to a whole people, clad as for a night of voluptuousness. He wept with rage over all these mysteries of love, profaned, soiled, laid bare, withered forever. He wept with rage as he pictured to himself how many impure looks had been gratified at the sight of that badly fastened shift, and that this beautiful girl, this virgin lily, this cup of modesty and delight, to which he would have dared to place his lips only trembling, had just been transformed into a sort of public bowl, whereat the vilest populace of Paris, thieves, beggars, lackeys, had come to quaff in common an audacious, impure, and depraved pleasure.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后，他从卫队长又想到了民众，感到前所未知的嫉恨：整个的民众，他们居然也看见了他心爱的女人只穿着内衣，几乎赤身露体。他痛心疾首地想到：这个女人，只有他才在黑暗中隐约见过她的肉体，原本是他的最高福祉，现在却仅仅穿着供淫欲之夜用的衣衫，暴露在大中午光天化日之下，交由全体贱民玩赏。他狂怒地痛哭失声，悲悼他自己爱情的一切神秘竟然这样受到玷辱、污损、剥露而永远凋残。他狂怒地痛哭，想象着该有多少双龌龊的眼睛从那无法扣好的衬衫里尽情享受，而这位美貌少女，百合花般的处女，娇羞和福祉盈怀的美酒，即使他也只敢战栗着略略沾唇，现在却变成了一种公用食盆（1），甚至最卑贱的巴黎贱民、盗贼、乞丐、仆役都来一同享受无耻的、淫秽的、道德沦丧的乐趣。【注：（1）兵士、教士等等共同用勺或其他食具从中取食的盆子。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And when he sought to picture to himself the happiness which he might have found upon earth, if she had not been a gypsy, and if he had not been a priest, if Phoebus had not existed and if she had loved him; when he pictured to himself that a life of serenity and love would have been possible to him also, even to him; that there were at that very moment, here and there upon the earth, happy couples spending the hours in sweet converse beneath orange trees, on the banks of brooks, in the presence of a setting sun, of a starry night; and that if God had so willed, he might have formed with her one of those blessed couples,-- his heart melted in tenderness and despair.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他竭力想象他本可以在地上获致的幸福——假如她不是吉卜赛女人，假如他自己不是教士，假如孚比斯并不存在，假如她不爱他；他想象着他本来也可能享受到安详的爱情生活：就在此刻，就在地面上，随时可见对对情侣，在柑子树下，在小溪边，观赏着夕阳余辉，期待着灿烂星空，情话绵绵，说个没完，如果上帝允许，他原可以同她两人成为其中受祝福的一对，——当他这样想象的时候，他的心因柔情和绝望而销蚀了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Oh! she! still she! It was this fixed idea which returned incessantly, which tortured him, which ate into his brain, and rent his vitals. He did not regret, he did not repent; all that he had done he was ready to do again; he preferred to behold her in the hands of the executioner rather than in the arms of the captain. But he suffered; he suffered so that at intervals he tore out handfuls of his hair to see whether it were not turning white.</div>

<div class="line_en">Among other moments there came one, when it occurred to him that it was perhaps the very minute when the hideous chain which he had seen that morning, was pressing its iron noose closer about that frail and graceful neck. This thought caused the perspiration to start from every pore.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有那么一阵子，他想起也许正是此刻，他早上看见的那条狞恶的铁链收紧活结，死死缠住了那样柔弱、那样优美的颈项。顿时，他感到每个毛孔都沁出了冷汗。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">While this hurricane of despair overturned, broke, tore up, bent, uprooted everything in his soul, he gazed at nature around him. At his feet, some chickens were searching the thickets and pecking, enamelled beetles ran about in the sun; overhead, some groups of dappled gray clouds were floating across the blue sky; on the horizon, the spire of the Abbey Saint-Victor pierced the ridge of the hill with its slate obelisk; and the miller of the Copeaue hillock was whistling as he watched the laborious wings of his mill turning. All this active, organized, tranquil life, recurring around him under a thousand forms, hurt him. He resumed his flight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管伤心失意的风暴扰乱着、粉碎着、撕裂着、扭曲着、拔除着他灵魂中的一切，他偶尔也瞥见了四周的自然景物。在他脚下，几只鸡在草丛里啄食，金龟子迎着阳光飞舞；在他头顶上，几堆灰斑云朵在湛蓝天空中飘逸而去，天边的圣维克多教堂的尖塔以它那石板方碑刺破了山丘起伏的曲线；科波山墩上的磨坊主吹着口哨，瞅着风磨的翅翼转动。一切都生意盎然，井然有序，安详恬静，在他周围以千姿万态繁衍，这一切使他更加痛苦。于是，他又赶紧逃跑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was another moment when, while laughing diabolically at himself, he represented to himself la Esmeralda as he had seen her on that first day, lively, careless, joyous, gayly attired, dancing, winged, harmonious, and la Esmeralda of the last day, in her scanty shift, with a rope about her neck, mounting slowly with her bare feet, the angular ladder of the gallows; he figured to himself this double picture in such a manner that he gave vent to a terrible cry.</div>

<div class="line_en">Towards the hour of sunset, he examined himself again, and found himself nearly mad. The tempest which had raged within him ever since the instant when he had lost the hope and the will to save the gypsy,-- that tempest had not left in his conscience a single healthy idea, a single thought which maintained its upright position. His reason lay there almost entirely destroyed. There remained but two distinct images in his mind, la Esmeralda and the gallows; all the rest was blank. Those two images united, presented to him a frightful group; and the more he concentrated what attention and thought was left to him, the more he beheld them grow, in accordance with a fantastic progression, the one in grace, in charm, in beauty, in light, the other in deformity and horror; so that at last la Esmeralda appeared to him like a star, the gibbet like an enormous, fleshless arm.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="将近日暮，他再次自省，觉得自己几乎已经疯了。自从他失去救出埃及姑娘的任何希望和意愿以来，就在内心中爆发的暴风骤雨，使他心灵中不再剩下健全的思想，再也没有丝毫合情合理的念头。他的理性已经埋葬，几近全盘摧毁。他心中只剩下两个清晰的形象：爱斯美腊达和绞刑架。其他是一片漆黑。这两个联系在一起的形象向他呈现为可怕的联想，他越凝目审视心中还能注意、还能思考的一切，就越感到这两个形象以奇幻的速度增长不已：一个愈益优雅、妩媚、姣好、光华夺目，而另一个愈益狰狞可怖；终而，爱斯美腊达灿烂明星般出现在他眼前，而绞刑架好像一只瘦削无肉的巨臂。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He sped thus across the fields until evening. This flight from nature, life, himself, man, God, everything, lasted all day long. Sometimes he flung himself face downward on the earth, and tore up the young blades of wheat with his nails. Sometimes he halted in the deserted street of a village, and his thoughts were so intolerable that he grasped his head in both hands and tried to tear it from his shoulders in order to dash it upon the pavement.</div>

<div class="line_en">Meanwhile, the day continued to decline. The living being which still existed in him reflected vaguely on retracing its steps. He believed himself to be far away from Paris; on taking his bearings, he perceived that he had only circled the enclosure of the University. The spire of Saint-Sulpice, and the three lofty needles of Saint Germain-des-Prés, rose above the horizon on his right. He turned his steps in that direction. When he heard the brisk challenge of the men-at-arms of the abbey, around the crenelated, circumscribing wall of Saint-Germain, he turned aside, took a path which presented itself between the abbey and the lazar-house of the bourg, and at the expiration of a few minutes found himself on the verge of the Pré-aux-Clercs. This meadow was celebrated by reason of the brawls which went on there night and day; it was the hydra of the poor monks of Saint-Germain: quod mouachis Sancti-Germaini pratensis hydra fuit, clericis nova semper dissidiorum capita suscitantibus. The archdeacon was afraid of meeting some one there; he feared every human countenance; he had just avoided the University and the Bourg Saint-Germain; he wished to re-enter the streets as late as possible. He skirted the Pré-aux-Clercs, took the deserted path which separated it from the Dieu-Neuf, and at last reached the water's edge. There Dom Claude found a boatman, who, for a few farthings in Parisian coinage, rowed him up the Seine as far as the point of the city, and landed him on that tongue of abandoned land where the reader has already beheld Gringoire dreaming, and which was prolonged beyond the king's gardens, parallel to the Ile du Passeur-aux-Vaches.</div>

<div class="line_en">The sun had set behind the lofty Tour-de-Nesle. It was the twilight hour. The sky was white, the water of the river was white. Between these two white expanses, the left bank of the Seine, on which his eyes were fixed, projected its gloomy mass and, rendered ever thinner and thinner by perspective, it plunged into the gloom of the horizon like a black spire. It was loaded with houses, of which only the obscure outline could be distinguished, sharply brought out in shadows against the light background of the sky and the water. Here and there windows began to gleam, like the holes in a brazier. That immense black obelisk thus isolated between the two white expanses of the sky and the river, which was very broad at this point, produced upon Dom Claude a singular effect, comparable to that which would be experienced by a man who, reclining on his back at the foot of the tower of Strasburg, should gaze at the enormous spire plunging into the shadows of the twilight above his head. Only, in this case, it was Claude who was erect and the obelisk which was lying down; but, as the river, reflecting the sky, prolonged the abyss below him, the immense promontory seemed to be as boldly launched into space as any cathedral spire; and the impression was the same. This impression had even one stronger and more profound point about it, that it was indeed the tower of Strasbourg, but the tower of Strasbourg two leagues in height; something unheard of, gigantic, immeasurable; an edifice such as no human eye has ever seen; a tower of Babel. The chimneys of the houses, the battlements of the walls, the faceted gables of the roofs, the spire of the Augustines, the tower of Nesle, all these projections which broke the profile of the colossal obelisk added to the illusion by displaying in eccentric fashion to the eye the indentations of a luxuriant and fantastic sculpture.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="夕阳西下，坠落到纳勒高塔的背后。正是薄暮时分。天上白茫茫，水上白茫茫。水天两白之间，是他凝目呆望的塞纳河左岸：这时整个左岸以庞大的阴影投射过来，向远方延伸，越远越细薄，像一支黑箭插入天际雾霭之中。那边房屋成堆，只看见黝黑的侧影，在明亮的水光天色衬托下，越发显得黑糊糊的一片。到处有窗子开始闪亮，像是一个个炉口。水天两苍茫，中间这样突出着的这伟岸方碑似的阴影，在这里看尤为宽阔，给予堂克洛德的印象是奇特的：好似一个人仰卧在斯特拉斯堡钟楼脚下，仰望那巨大尖塔在头顶上高耸入云，为若明若暗的暮色所掩映。只是，克洛德是站着的，却是方碑在那里躺着；但是，既然河水反映天空，他脚下的深渊也就更加深不可测，那伟岸的尖角也就像任何主教堂的尖塔一样泼辣挺拔，刺入空间了。给人的印象正是这样。这种印象奇特而愈益深刻之处，还在于纵然好似斯特拉斯堡尖塔，而这一座的高度却达两法里，真是闻所未闻，如此雄伟，如此不可测度，这是人的眼睛从未见过的，是一座巴别塔。房屋的烟突、墙垣的雉堞、为屋顶所切削的山墙、圣奥古斯坦的尖塔、纳勒的塔楼，所有这些突角刺破了那伟岸方碑的侧影，以丰富而奇幻的雕塑，奇特地巧饰以种种剪影，平添了幻想翩翩的色彩。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The monotonous rocking of the boat and the ripple of the water had, in some sort, quieted the unhappy Claude. When the boatman had taken his departure, he remained standing stupidly on the strand, staring straight before him and perceiving objects only through magnifying oscillations which rendered everything a sort of phantasmagoria to him. The fatigue of a great grief not infrequently produces this effect on the mind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小船单调的摇晃和潺潺流水声，多少也麻痹了不幸的克洛德的知觉。小船离去之后，他仍然呆呆地站立在滩头，直瞪瞪看着前方，所见之物无一不在摇晃，又像放大镜一般，使他看一切事物都像是鬼影幢幢。过度痛苦以致精疲力竭，对我们心智产生这种作用，其实是常有的事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Claude, in the state of hallucination in which he found himself, believed that he saw, that he saw with his actual eyes, the bell tower of hell; the thousand lights scattered over the whole height of the terrible tower seemed to him so many porches of the immense interior furnace; the voices and noises which escaped from it seemed so many shrieks, so many death groans.

<div class="line_en">When he re-entered the streets, the passers-by elbowing each other by the light of the shop-fronts, produced upon him the effect of a constant going and coming of spectres about him. There were strange noises in his ears; extraordinary fancies disturbed his brain. He saw neither houses, nor pavements, nor chariots, nor men and women, but a chaos of indeterminate objects whose edges melted into each other. At the corner of the Rue de la Barillerie, there was a grocer's shop whose porch was garnished all about, according to immemorial custom, with hoops of tin from which hung a circle of wooden candles, which came in contact with each other in the wind, and rattled like castanets. He thought he heard a cluster of skeletons at Montfauçon clashing together in the gloom.</div>

There was a light in the window of a ground-floor room; he approached. Through a cracked window he beheld a mean chamber which recalled some confused memory to his mind. In that room, badly lighted by a meagre lamp, there was a fresh, light-haired young man, with a merry face, who amid loud bursts of laughter was embracing a very audaciously attired young girl; and near the lamp sat an old crone spinning and singing in a quavering voice.

<div class="line_en">In the church he found the gloom and silence of a cavern. By the deep shadows which fell in broad sheets from all directions, he recognized the fact that the hangings for the ceremony of the morning had not yet been removed. The great silver cross shone from the depths of the gloom, powdered with some sparkling points, like the milky way of that sepulchral night. The long windows of the choir showed the upper extremities of their arches above the black draperies, and their painted panes, traversed by a ray of moonlight had no longer any hues but the doubtful colors of night, a sort of violet, white and blue, whose tint is found only on the faces of the dead. The archdeacon, on perceiving these wan spots all around the choir, thought he beheld the mitres of damned bishops. He shut his eyes, and when he opened them again, he thought they were a circle of pale visages gazing at him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他发现教堂里面像地穴一般黑暗死寂。到处都有大块大块的黑影，他知道这是为上午的死刑典礼张挂的帷幔还没有拆除。那银制大十字架在黑暗中以点点光斑闪亮，就像这坟墓似的夜空中的银河。唱诗班后面那几扇长窗的尖拱窗顶露出在黑色帷幕上面，一线月光透过窗子的彩色玻璃，玻璃窗显出可疑的颜色如同这黑夜一般：紫中泛白，白里透青，只应为死人脸上所有。副主教看看唱诗班席次四周窗顶的这些惨白尖拱，感到好像是看见了那些受天谴下地狱的主教们的法冠。他闭上眼睛，等他把眼睛重新睁开，又觉得这是一圈白如死灰的面孔在凝视他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Still, he ventured to glance at the church. The front was sombre; the sky behind was glittering with stars. The crescent of the moon, in her flight upward from the horizon, had paused at the moment, on the summit of the light hand tower, and seemed to have perched itself, like a luminous bird, on the edge of the balustrade, cut out in black trefoils.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="终于，他硬着头皮看看主教堂。门脸是阴森森的。它背后是灿烂的星空。一弯月亮刚从地平线上跃起不久，这时正滞留在右边钟楼顶上，像一只发光的鸟雀栖息在剪影呈一个个黑色梅花状的栏杆边上。">查看中文翻译</div>

Then it seemed to him that the church also was shaking, moving, becoming endued with animation, that it was alive; that each of the great columns was turning into an enormous paw, which was beating the earth with its big stone spatula, and that the gigantic cathedral was no longer anything but a sort of prodigious elephant, which was breathing and marching with its pillars for feet, its two towers for trunks and the immense black cloth for its housings.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他赶紧穿过教堂飞奔。这时，他好像感觉到教堂本身也在摇晃，动荡，有了生命，活起来了，每根粗大的圆柱变成一个巨爪，用它那扁平的足趾拍击地面，庞大的主教堂仿佛只是一头怪异惊人的巨象，呼呼喘气，行走着，以柱子作腿，两座钟楼是大象的鼻子，张挂的黑幕就是大象身上的鞍衣。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For one moment, he was relieved. As he plunged into the side aisles, he perceived a reddish light behind a cluster of pillars. He ran towards it as to a star. It was the poor lamp which lighted the public breviary of Notre-Dame night and day, beneath its iron grating. He flung himself eagerly upon the holy book in the hope of finding some consolation, or some encouragement there. The hook lay open at this passage of Job, over which his staring eye glanced,—</div>

At length some strength returned to him; it occurred to him to take refuge in his tower beside his faithful Quasimodo.
