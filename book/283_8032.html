<div class="line_en">Emma could not feel a doubt of having given Harriet's fancy a proper direction and raised the gratitude of her young vanity to a very good purpose, for she found her decidedly more sensible than before of Mr. Elton's being a remarkably handsome man, with most agreeable manners; and as she had no hesitation in following up the assurance of his admiration by agreeable hints, she was soon pretty confident of creating as much liking on Harriet's side, as there could be any occasion for. She was quite convinced of Mr. Elton's being in the fairest way of falling in love, if not in love already. She had no scruple with regard to him. He talked of Harriet, and praised her so warmly, that she could not suppose any thing wanting which a little time would not add. His perception of the striking improvement of Harriet's manner, since her introduction at Hartfield, was not one of the least agreeable proofs of his growing attachment.</div>

<div class="line_en">Harriet was soon back again, and the proposal almost immediately made; and she had no scruples which could stand many minutes against the earnest pressing of both the others. Emma wished to go to work directly, and therefore produced the portfolio containing her various attempts at portraits, for not one of them had ever been finished, that they might decide together on the best size for Harriet. Her many beginnings were displayed. Miniatures, half-lengths, whole-lengths, pencil, crayon, and water-colours had been all tried in turn. She had always wanted to do every thing, and had made more progress both in drawing and music than many might have done with so little labour as she would ever submit to. She played and sang; -- and drew in almost every style; but steadiness had always been wanting; and in nothing had she approached the degree of excellence which she would have been glad to command, and ought not to have failed of. She was not much deceived as to her own skill either as an artist or a musician, but she was not unwilling to have others deceived, or sorry to know her reputation for accomplishment often higher than it deserved.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不一会工夫，哈丽特又进来了，两人马上提出了给她画像的事。哈丽特虽然有些顾虑，但经不住两人的再三劝说，没过多久就同意了。爱玛想要马上动笔，因此便取出画夹，里面夹着她好多的习作，却没有一张画完的，他们准备一起挑选一下，看给哈丽特画多大的比较合适。她把一张张画摆开，都是刚开了个头，什么小画像、半身像、全身像、铅笔画、蜡笔画、水笔画，全都试过了。她总是什么都想试试，无论绘画还是音乐，都能少出力气多长进，让许多人望尘莫及。她又弹琴又唱歌，还画各种风格的图画，可就是缺乏恒心。她什么都想精通，按理说也该精通，可惜什么都没精通过。她对自己的绘画和弹唱技艺并没看得太高，不过要是别人把她的技艺看得很高，她也不会不愿意，知道自己的才艺往往被人高估，她也并不感到不安。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">`No great variety of faces for you,' said Emma. `I had only my own family to study from. There is my father -- another of my father -- but the idea of sitting for his picture made him so nervous, that I could only take him by stealth; neither of them very like therefore. Mrs. Weston again, and again, and again, you see. Dear Mrs. Weston! always my kindest friend on every occasion. She would sit whenever I asked her. There is my sister; and really quite her own little elegant figure! -- and the face not unlike. I should have made a good likeness of her, if she would have sat longer, but she was in such a hurry to have me draw her four children that she would not be quiet. Then, here come all my attempts at three of those four children; -- there they are, Henry and John and Bella, from one end of the sheet to the other, and any one of them might do for any one of the rest. She was so eager to have them drawn that I could not refuse; but there is no making children of three or four years old stand still you know; nor can it be very easy to take any likeness of them, beyond the air and complexion, unless they are coarser featured than any of mama's children ever were. Here is my sketch of the fourth, who was a baby. I took him as he was sleeping on the sofa, and it is as strong a likeness of his cockade as you would wish to see. He had nestled down his head most conveniently. That's very like. I am rather proud of little George. The corner of the sofa is very good. Then here is my last,' -- unclosing a pretty sketch of a gentleman in small size, whole-length -- `my last and my best -- my brother, Mr. John Knightley. -- This did not want much of being finished, when I put it away in a pet, and vowed I would never take another likeness. I could not help being provoked; for after all my pains, and when I had really made a very good likeness of it -- (Mrs. Weston and I were quite agreed in thinking it very like) -- only too handsome -- too flattering -- but that was a fault on the right side -- after all this, came poor dear Isabella's cold approbation of -- `Yes, it was a little like -- but to be sure it did not do him justice.' We had had a great deal of trouble in persuading him to sit at all. It was made a great favour of; and altogether it was more than I could bear; and so I never would finish it, to have it apologised over as an unfavourable likeness, to every morning visitor in Brunswick Square; -- and, as I said, I did then forswear ever drawing any body again. But for Harriet's sake, or rather for my own, and as there are no husbands and wives in the case at present, I will break my resolution now.'</div>

<div class="line_en">The sitting began; and Harriet, smiling and blushing, and afraid of not keeping her attitude and countenance, presented a very sweet mixture of youthful expression to the steady eyes of the artist. But there was no doing any thing, with Mr. Elton fidgeting behind her and watching every touch. She gave him credit for stationing himself where he might gaze and gaze again without offence; but was really obliged to put an end to it, and request him to place himself elsewhere.

She could not respect his eye, but his love and his complaisance were unexceptionable.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃尔顿先生十分乐意。哈丽特听他念书，爱玛静静地作画。她得允许他不时地过来看一眼，否则就太没有情人味了。他随时留心，画笔稍一停顿，就跳起来看看画得怎么样了，为之倾倒一番。有这样一个人在旁边鼓气，倒也没有什么令人不快的，因为他心里情意绵绵，在几乎还看不出像不像的时候，就能发觉画得很逼真了。爱玛并不欣赏他的眼力，他的痴情和殷勤却是无可挑剔的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“画得很好，”伍德豪斯先生说。“画得好极啦！亲爱的，你画的画总是这么好看。我看谁也没有你画得好。只有一点我不是很欣赏：她似乎坐在户外，肩上只披了一条披巾——让人担心她要着凉。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Emma knew that she had, but would not own it; and Mr. Elton warmly added, `Oh no! certainly not too tall; not in the least too tall. Consider, she is sitting down -- which naturally presents a different -- which in short gives exactly the idea -- and the proportions must be preserved, you know. Proportions, fore-shortening. -- Oh no! it gives one exactly the idea of such a height as Miss Smith's. Exactly so indeed!'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱玛知道确实如此，可她又不愿承认，这时埃尔顿先生情绪激昂地说道：“哦，没有的事！根本就不过高，一点也不过高。想想看，她是坐着的——这当然与站着不一样啦——总而言之，跟她真人丝毫不差——你知道，还要保持一定的比例。按比例缩短。哦，没有的事！画的就是史密斯小姐的身高，分毫不差。确实分毫不差！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">`You, sir, may say any thing,' cried Mr. Elton, `but I must confess that I regard it as a most happy thought, the placing of Miss Smith out of doors; and the tree is touched with such inimitable spirit! Any other situation would have been much less in character. The na? veté of Miss Smith's manners -- and altogether -- Oh, it is most admirable! I cannot keep my eyes from it. I never saw such a likeness.'</div>

<div class="line_en">The next thing wanted was to get the picture framed; and here were a few difficulties. It must be done directly; it must be done in London; the order must go through the hands of some intelligent person whose taste could be depended on; and Isabella, the usual doer of all commissions, must not be applied to, because it was December, and Mr. Woodhouse could not bear the idea of her stirring out of her house in the fogs of December. But no sooner was the distress known to Mr. Elton, than it was removed. His gallantry was always on the alert. `Might he be trusted with the commission, what infinite pleasure should he have in executing it! he could ride to London at any time. It was impossible to say how much he should be gratified by being employed on such an errand.'</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr. Elton was to take the drawing to London, chuse the frame, and give the directions; and Emma thought she could so pack it as to ensure its safety without much incommoding him, while he seemed mostly fearful of not being incommoded enough.</div>

<div class="line_en">`This man is almost too gallant to be in love,' thought Emma. `I should say so, but that I suppose there may be a hundred different ways of being in love. He is an excellent young man, and will suit Harriet exactly; it will be an ``Exactly so,'' as he says himself; but he does sigh and languish, and study for compliments rather more than I could endure as a principal. I come in for a pretty good share as a second. But it is his gratitude on Harriet's account.'</div>
