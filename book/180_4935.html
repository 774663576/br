<div class="line_en">What was she dreaming about, Mrs Ramsay wondered, seeing her engrossed, as she stood there, with some thought of her own, so that she had to repeat the message twice -- ask Mildred if Andrew, Miss Doyle, and Mr Rayley have come back?-- The words seemed to be dropped into a well, where, if the waters were clear, they were also so extraordinarily distorting that, even as they descended, one saw them twisting about to make Heaven knows what pattern on the floor of the child's mind. What message would Cam give the cook? Mrs Ramsay wondered. And indeed it was only by waiting patiently, and hearing that there was an old woman in the kitchen with very red cheeks, drinking soup out of a basin, that Mrs Ramsay at last prompted that parrot-like instinct which had picked up Mildred's words quite accurately and could now produce them, if one waited, in a colourless singsong. Shifting from foot to foot, Cam repeated the words, "No, they haven't, and I've told Ellen to clear away tea."</div>

I want you a moment!" as she dashed past. She was off like a bird, bullet, or arrow, impelled by what desire, shot by whom, at what directed, who could say? What, what? Mrs Ramsay pondered, watching her. It might be a vision -- of a shell, of a wheelbarrow, of a fairy kingdom on the far side of the hedge; or it might be the glory of speed; no one knew.

This going off after luncheon for a walk, even though Andrew was with them -- what could it mean? except that she had decided, rightly, Mrs Ramsay thought (and she was very, very fond of Minta), to accept that good fellow, who might not be brilliant, but then, thought Mrs Ramsay, realising that James was tugging at her, to make her go on reading aloud the Fisherman and his Wife, she did in her own heart infinitely prefer boobies to clever men who wrote dissertations; Charles Tansley, for instance. Anyhow it must have happened, one way or the other, by now.</div>

<div class="line_en">'Well, what does she want then?' said the Flounder." And where were they now? Mrs Ramsay wondered, reading and thinking, quite easily, both at the same time; for the story of the Fisherman and his Wife was like the bass gently accompanying a tune, which now and then ran up unexpectedly into the melody. And when should she be told? If nothing happened, she would have to speak seriously to Minta. For she could not go trapesing about all over the country, even if Nancy were with them (she tried again, unsuccessfully, to visualize their backs going down the path, and to count them). She was responsible to Minta's parents -- the Owl and the Poker. Her nicknames for them shot into her mind as she read. The Owl and the Poker -- yes, they would be annoyed if they heard -- and they were certain to hear -- that Minta, staying with the Ramsays, had been seen etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. "He wore a wig in the House of Commons and she ably assisted him at the head of the stairs," she repeated, fishing them up out of her mind by a phrase which, coming back from some party, she had made to amuse her husband. Dear, dear, Mrs Ramsay said to herself, how did they produce this incongruous daughter? this tomboy Minta, with a hole in her stocking? How did she exist in that portentous atmosphere where the maid was always removing in a dust-pan the sand that the parrot had scattered, and conversation was almost entirely reduced to the exploits -- interesting perhaps, but limited after all -- of that bird? Naturally, one had asked her to lunch, tea, dinner, finally to stay with them up at Finlay, which had resulted in some friction with the Owl, her mother, and more calling, and more conversation, and more sand, and really at the end of it, she had told enough lies about parrots to last her a lifetime (so she had said to her husband that night, coming back from the party). However, Minta came…Yes, she came, Mrs Ramsay thought, suspecting some thorn in the tangle of this thought; and disengaging it found it to be this: a woman had once accused her of "robbing her of her daughter's affections"; something Mrs Doyle had said made her remember that charge again. Wishing to dominate, wishing to interfere, making people do what she wished -- that was the charge against her, and she thought it most unjust. How could she help being "like that" to look at? No one could accuse her of taking pains to impress. She was often ashamed of her own shabbiness. Nor was she domineering, nor was she tyrannical. It was more true about hospitals and drains and the dairy. About things like that she did feel passionately, and would, if she had the chance, have liked to take people by the scruff of their necks and make them see. No hospital on the whole island. It was a disgrace. Milk delivered at your door in London positively brown with dirt. It should be made illegal. A model dairy and a hospital up here -- those two things she would have liked to do, herself. But how? With all these children? When they were older, then perhaps she would have time; when they were all at school.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，那么她想要什么呢？”比目鱼问道。他们现在在什么地方？拉姆齐夫人一面念一面在心里琢磨。她—心二用起来很是轻松，因为渔夫和他妻子的故事就像轻柔地给一支曲子伴奏的低音部分，时不时地会突然响起在旋律之中。应该什么时候对她说？如果什么事情也没有发生。她就得和明塔严肃地谈一谈。因为她不能这样在乡下到处闲逛，即使有南希和他们在一起也不行（她又—次试图回想他们沿小路走去时的背影，数数是几个人，但是还是想不起来）。她要对明塔的父母——猫头鹰和拨火棍——负责。她念着念着故事，她给他们起的绰号噌地窜进了脑子里。猫头鹰和拨火棍——是的，他们要是听见了会生气的——他们肯定会听到的——说明塔呆在拉姆齐家时被人看见如何如何，等等。“他在下议院当上了议员，她能干地在楼梯头上帮助他往上爬。”她重复着一次从某个宴会上回家时为给丈夫逗乐说过的一句话，这勾起了对他们的记忆。哎呀，哎呀，拉姆齐夫人对自己说，他们怎么会生出这样一个和他们完全不相称的女儿来的？这个假小子明塔，袜子上还破了一个洞？她是如何在她的家庭那样一个环境里生存的？那里女仆整天拿着簸箕清扫鹦鹉洒在地上的沙子，而谈话几乎完全缩减到那只鸟的本事上——也许很有趣，但毕竟太局限了。很自然你开始请她来吃午饭、茶点、晚餐，最后请她到芬莱和他们住上几天。这件事造成了她和母亲猫头鹰之间的一些摩擦，于是更多的拜访，更多的谈话，更多的沙子，最后她关于鹦鹉的谎话说得多到真够她用一辈子的了（那晚他们从宴会上回家时她就是这么对她丈夫说的）。不管怎样，明塔总算来了…—是的，她来了，拉姆齐夫人想道，她怀疑在这缠结成一团的思绪中隐藏着某种不安；她理清思绪，发现原来是这么回事：有一个女人曾经指责她“夺走了女儿对她的爱”；多伊尔夫人说过的一些话使她又想起了那个指责。爱支配人，爱干涉人，让别人按她的愿望做事——这些就是对她的指责，而她认为这极不公平。她看上去是“这个样子”，她有什么办法？没人能够指责她在费尽心机地去引人注目。她常为自己的寒酸而感到难堪。她也不盛气凌人、专横跋扈。牵涉到医院、下水道和牛奶场，这话还有几分道理。有关这一类的事情，她确实很容易动感情，要是她有机会，她真想一把抓住人们的颈背好让他们看到—切。整个岛上没有一家医院。真是个耻辱。在伦敦，送到家门口的牛奶整个被尘土污染成了棕黄色。应该宣布这种事情为非法。在这儿建一家模范奶牛场和一 家医院——这两件事情她很想亲自去做。但是怎么做？带着这么一大群孩子？等他们大一点，也许那时候她会有时间；等他们都上了学以后。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Oh, but she never wanted James to grow a day older! or Cam either. These two she would have liked to keep for ever just as they were, demons of wickedness, angels of delight, never to see them grow up into long-legged monsters. Nothing made up up for the loss. When she read just now to James, "and there were numbers of soldiers with kettledrums and trumpets," and his eyes darkened, she thought, why should they grow up and lose all that? He was the most gifted, the most sensitive of her children. But all, she thought, were full of promise. Prue, a perfect angel with the others, and sometimes now, at night especially, she took one's breath away with her beauty. Andrew -- even her husband admitted that his gift for mathematics was extraordinary. And Nancy and Roger, they were both wild creatures now, scampering about over the country all day long. As for Rose, her mouth was too big, but she had a wonderful gift with her hands. If they had charades, Rose made the dresses; made everything; liked best arranging tables, flowers, anything. She did not like it that Jasper should shoot birds; but it was only a stage; they all went through stages. Why, she asked, pressing her chin on James's head, should they grow up so fast? Why should they go to school? She would have liked always to have had a baby. She was happiest carrying one in her arms. Then people might say she was tyrannical, domineering, masterful, if they chose; she did not mind. And, touching his hair with her lips, she thought, he will never be so happy again, but stopped herself, remembering how it angered her husband that she should say that. Still, it was true. They were happier now than they would ever be again. A tenpenny tea set made Cam happy for days. She heard them stamping and crowing on the floor above her head the moment they awoke. They came bustling along the passage. Then the door sprang open and in they came, fresh as roses, staring, wide awake, as if this coming into the dining-room after breakfast, which they did every day of their lives, was a positive event to them, and so on, with one thing after another, all day long, until she went up to say good-night to them, and found them netted in their cots like birds among cherries and raspberries, still making up stories about some little bit of rubbish -- something they had heard, something they had picked up in the garden. They all had their little treasures… And so she went down and said to her husband, Why must they grow up and lose it all? Never will they be so happy again. And he was angry. Why take such a gloomy view of life? he said. It is not sensible. For it was odd; and she believed it to be true; that with all his gloom and desperation he was happier, more hopeful on the whole, than she was. Less exposed to human worries -- perhaps that was it. He had always his work to fall back on. Not that she herself was "pessimistic," as he accused her of being. Only she thought life -- and a little strip of time presented itself to her eyes -- her fifty years. There it was before her -- life. Life, she thought -- but she did not finish her thought. She took a look at life, for she had a clear sense of it there, something real, something private, which she shared neither with her children nor with her husband. A sort of transaction went on between them, in which she was on one side, and life was on another, and she was always trying to get the better of it, as it was of her; and sometimes they parleyed (when she sat alone); there were, she remembered, great reconciliation scenes; but for the most part, oddly enough, she must admit that she felt this thing that she called life terrible, hostile, and quick to pounce on you if you gave it a chance. There were eternal problems: suffering; death; the poor. There was always a woman dying of cancer even here. And yet she had said to all these children, You shall go through it all. To eight people she had said relentlessly that (and the bill for the greenhouse would be fifty pounds). For that reason, knowing what was before them -- love and ambition and being wretched alone in dreary places -- she had often the feeling, Why must they grow up and lose it all? And then she said to herself, brandishing her sword at life, Nonsense. They will be perfectly happy. And here she was, she reflected, feeling life rather sinister again, making Minta marry Paul Rayley; because whatever she might feel about her own transaction, she had had experiences which need not happen to every one (she did not name them to herself); she was driven on, too quickly she knew, almost as if it were an escape for her too, to say that people must marry; people must have children.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="啊，可是她永远也不希望詹姆斯长大—天，卡姆也一样。她希望这两个孩子永远保持现在这样，是淘气的小鬼，快乐的天使，她永远不想看到他们长成长腿的怪物。无论什么也弥补不了这个损失。当她现在给詹姆斯念，“有许多带着铜鼓和喇叭的士兵”，他的目光变得阴沉时，她心里想，他们为什么要长大，从而失去这一切？在她的子女中，他是最有天赋、最敏感的—个。但是，她心里想，他们全部会有很好的前途。普鲁在和别的孩子相处时简直是个天使，现在有些时候，特别是在晚上，她的美丽已令人感到惊羡。安德鲁——就连她的丈大也承认他在数学方面有非凡的天才。南希和罗杰现在还都野得很，整天在乡间乱跑。至于说萝丝，她的嘴太大，但是她手巧极了。要是他们演猜字谜的哑剧，总足萝丝做服装；做所有的东西；她最喜欢布置餐桌、摆花，不管布置什么都喜欢。她不喜欢贾斯珀老爱打鸟；但这只是他成长中的—个阶段；他们都经过各种阶段。为什么，她把下巴贴在詹姆斯的头上，问自己道，他们这么快就长大了？他们为什么要去上学？她很希望身边永远有—个小娃娃。怀里抱着小娃娃她感到最幸福。人们会说她专横跋扈，盛气凌人，好支配人，他们愿意说就说吧，她不在乎。她用嘴唇轻抚着詹姆斯的头发、心里在想，他以后再也不会这么幸福了，但她想起了这样说使丈夫多么生气，便立刻制止了自己的这个念头。不过，这是真的。他们以后再也不会像现在这样幸福了。一套十个便士的茶具让卡姆高兴了好几天。他们一醒过来她就能听见他们在她头顶上面的地板上跺脚、欢闹。他们喧闹着跑过走廊。于是门猛地打开，他们一拥而入，像玫瑰花一样清新，机警地瞪大着眼睛，好像他们天天都要做的到餐厅来吃早饭对于他们是一件肯定无疑的大事情；如此等等整天事情一件连一件，直到她上楼去和他们说晚安，看见他们像小鸟站在樱桃和山莓之间般钻在挂着蚊帐的小床里，还在就一些鸡毛蒜皮的小事编故事——他们听来的，或在花园里无意得到的 他们都有自己小小的宝贝……于是她走下楼对丈夫说，他们为什么非得长大，失去这一切？他们永远也不会再这样幸福了。他生气了。为什么对生活抱这样悲观的态度？他说。这种看法不合情理。因为这—点很古怪；她相信这是事实；尽管他也悲观绝望，总的来说却比她更快活，更怀有希望。比她经受的人生烦恼要少——也许原因就在于此。他总能够从工作中找到支持。并不是说她如他所指责的那样很“悲观”，只不过是她想到生活时——眼前就出现了一小段岁月，她的五十年生活。就这样呈现在她眼前——生活，生活：她想道，但她并没有结束自己的思维。她看了一眼生活，因为在这一点上她有着清楚的观念，生活是某种真实、私密的东西，她既不和儿女也不和丈夫分享。在他们之间进行着一种交易，其中她是一方，生活是另一方，她总想占上风，生活也想占她的上风；有时候他们谈判（当她一人独坐时）；她记得有过一些了不起的和解场面；但奇怪的是，她必须承认，大多数时候她感到她叫做生活的这东西很可怕，充满敌意，一有机会就很快向你猛扑过来。还有那些永恒的问题：痛苦、死亡、穷人。即使在这儿，也总有一个女人因患癌症而不久人世。可是她却对所有的孩子说，你们将经历这一切。她曾对八个人无情地说过这话（修理温室的账单将会是五十镑）。她知道他们面临着什么——爱情和抱负以及在凄惨的地方独自忍受痛苦——因此才常有这种感觉：为什么他们非得长大，失去这一切？可是她又会向生活挥舞着剑对自己说，胡扯。他们会非常幸福。她沉思道，瞧她在这儿要让明塔和保罗·雷勒结婚，又感到生活充满了凶险；因为无论她对于自己的交易有什么感觉以及有过并非人人都经历过的遭遇（她并没有向自己具体列举这些遭遇）；她不由自主地说人应该结婚，人应该生孩子，她知道自己话说得太急促了，几乎像是自己的一种摆脱。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She turned the page; there were only a few lines more, so that she would finish the story, though it was past bed-time. It was getting late. The light in the garden told her that; and the whitening of the flowers and something grey in the leaves conspired together, to rouse in her a feeling of anxiety. What it was about she could not think at first. Then she remembered; Paul and Minta and Andrew had not come back. She summoned before her again the little group on the terrace in front of the hall door, standing looking up into the sky. Andrew had his net and basket. That meant he was going to catch crabs and things. That meant he would climb out on to a rock; he would be cut off. Or coming back single file on one of those little paths above the cliff one of them might slip. He would roll and then crash. It was growing quite dark.</div>

Turning, she looked across the bay, and there, sure enough, coming regularly across the waves first two quick strokes and then one long steady stroke, was the light of the Lighthouse.

<div class="line_cn" title="他很快就会问她，“咱们去灯塔吗？”而她只得说，“不去；明天不去；你父亲说不去。”恰好这时米尔德里得进来叫他们，忙乱使他们分散了注意力。但是米尔德里得抱着他出去的时候他仍不断回头看着。她肯定他在想，我们明天不去灯塔了；她想，他—生都会记得这件事的。">查看中文翻译</div>
