<div class="line_en">Jill ought to have been back at the white rock already but she had quite forgotten that part of her orders in the excitement of watching the fight. Now she remembered. She turned at once and ran to it, and arrived there barely a second before the others. It thus happened that all of them, for a moment, had their backs to the enemy. They all wheeled round the moment they had reached it. A terrible sight met their eyes.</div>

There was no getting at it now.</div>

<div class="line_en">Everyone ducked and pulled his helmet well over his nose. The Dogs crouched behind. But though a few arrows came their way it soon became clear that they were not being shot at. Griffle and his Dwarfs were at their archery again. This time they were coolly shooting at the Calormenes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大家都低下头来，把头盔拉得遮住鼻子。狗儿们蹲伏在他们的背后。然而，尽管有几支箭向他们这边射来，不久就弄明白了：他们并不是对方要射杀的对象。格里夫尔和他的小矮人们又在摆弄弓箭了，这一次他们正在冷静地射杀卡乐门士兵。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Whatever that fight may have been like, it did not last long. The noise of it died away. Then Jill saw the Tarkaan coming back to the stable: eleven men followed him, dragging eleven bound Dwarfs. (Whether the others had all been killed, or whether some of them had got away, was never known.)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不论这场战斗是怎么打的，打的时间可不长。鼓噪声逐渐消失了。于是吉尔便看到泰坎回到马厩这边来了；有十一个兵跟着他，拖着十一个擒获后绑起来的小矮人。（其他的小矮人是否都被杀死了，其中是否有些已经逃走了，那可永远不知道了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tirian and his friends, still panting from their fight and thankful for a few minutes' rest, stood and looked on while the Tarkaan led his men against the Dwarfs. It was a strange scene by now. The fire had sunk lower: the light it gave was now less and of a darker red. As far as one could see, the whole place of assembly was now empty except for the Dwarf and the Calormenes. In that light one couldn't make out much of what was happening. It sounded as if the Dwarfs were putting up a good fight. Tirian could hear Griffle using dreadful language, and every now and then the Tarkaan calling, "Take all you can alive! Take them alive!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="蒂莲和他的朋友们，作战后喘息未止，倒很感谢有几分钟休息，泰坎带领他的人马向小矮人们冲击时，他们站在一旁观看。眼前是一片奇怪的景象。篝火的火焰往下落了，它发出的光亮度也减低了，颜色也变为暗红色了。人们能够看得出的是：整个集会的地方现在空荡荡的，只剩下小矮人和卡乐门士兵。在这种暗淡的光线里，人们对正在发生的事情，已经看不到看不清多少了。听上去小矮人们正在进行一场激烈的拼搏。蒂莲听得见格里夫尔正在使用可怕的语言骂人，而泰坎间歇地叫喊：“要尽力把他们全都活捉过来！活捉他们！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The little party by the white rock watched these doings and whispered to one another. They had found a trickle of water coming down the rock and all had drunk eagerly -- Jill and Poggin and the King in their hands, while the four-footed ones lapped from the little pool which it had made at the foot of the stone. Such was their thirst that it seemed the most delicious drink they had ever had in their lives, and while they were drinking they were perfectly happy and could not think of anything else.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="白石头旁的这一小群人马瞧着这些行动，互相窃窃私语。他们发现一道涓滴细流正从白石头上淌下来，大家便迫不及待地喝水——吉尔、波金和国王都用双手捧水喝，四条腿的动物则从白石头底下积起来的小小水潭中舔水吃。他们是那么口渴得厉害，因而这水就仿佛是他们平生所喝的最美味的饮料；他们喝水时开心得很，因而其他事情都想不起来了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">What made it hopeless, even apart from the numbers of the enemy, was the spears. The Calormenes who had been with the Ape almost from the beginning had had no spears: that was because they had come into Narnia by ones and twos, pretending to be peaceful merchants, and of course they had carried no spears for a spear is not a thing you can hide. The new ones must have come in later, after the Ape was already strong and they could march openly. The spears made all the difference. With a long spear you can kill a boar before you are in reach of his tusks and a unicorn before you are in reach of his horn; if you are very quick and keep your head. And now the levelled spears were closing in on Tirian and his last friends. Next minute they were all fighting for their lives.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="除了敌人人多势众外，使战斗胜利无望的，乃是敌人的长矛。几乎从开头起一直跟无尾猿沆瀣一气的卡乐门人是没有长矛的：因为他们是一个两个地乔装成商人进入纳尼亚的，他们当然不带长矛，长矛可不是件能藏起来的东西。新的卡乐门人必定是以后才来的，那时无尾猿已经强大，卡乐门人可以公开地行军了。有了长矛，情况就截然不同。如果你动作敏捷，头脑镇静的话，手持长矛，你便可以在獠牙还够不着你时把野猪刺死，在独角还够不着你时把独角兽刺死。如今并举的许多长矛都在向蒂莲和他最后的朋友们逼拢来了。他们不久都在为保全生命而战斗拼搏了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In a way it wasn't quite so bad as you might think. When you are using every muscle to the full -- ducking under a spear-point here, leaping over it there, lunging forward, drawing back, wheeling round -- you haven't much time to feel either frightened or sad. Tirian knew he could do nothing for the others now; they were all doomed together. He vaguely saw the Boar go down on one side of him, and Jewel fighting furiously on the other. Out of the corner of one eye he saw, but only just saw, a big Calormene pulling Jill away somewhere by her hair. But he hardly thought about any of these things. His only thought now was to sell his life as dearly as he could. The worst of it was that he couldn't keep to the position in which he had started, under the white rock. A man who is fighting a dozen enemies at once must take his chances wherever he can; must dart in wherever he sees an enemy's breast or neck unguarded. In a very few strokes this may get you quite a distance from the spot where you began. Tirian soon found that he was getting further and further to the right, nearer to the stable. He had a vague idea in his mind that there was some good reason for keeping away from it. But he couldn't now remember what the reason was. And anyway, he couldn't help it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说不定你会认为：从某一方面看来，这样拼命战斗倒也不坏。当你充分运用全身的肌肉——这儿低头避过矛尖，那儿跳过矛尖，忽而猛烈前冲，忽而往后退缩，忽而旋转又旋转——你就没有时间感到惊惶或悲哀了。蒂莲知道现在他对其他的人马无能为力了：他们大家都在劫难逃。他模糊地看到野猪在他的身边倒下了，珍宝在另一边猛烈地战斗。他从一只眼睛的眼角上望见，只是勉强望见，一个卡乐门大个儿揪住吉尔的头发，把她拉到什么地方去了。但他很难考虑这些事情，哪一件也考虑不起来。他现在惟一的思想是尽其所能为自己的生命索取高昂的代价。最糟糕的是他不能固守住白石头下他最初所选定的阵地。一个人同时与十几个敌人作战，必须利用他能在任何地方碰到的机会；他在任何地方看到敌人的未曾保护的胸膛或颈子，就必须冲过去。而刚砍了几刀，就会使你离你出发的地点相当远了。蒂莲不久就发现自己愈来愈往右边儿前进，离马厩更近了。他脑子里有个朦朦胧胧的概念：远离马厩是大有道理的。但他没法儿把这道理记起来了。无论如何，他身不由己，无可奈何。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">All at once everything came quite clear. He found he was fighting the Tarkaan himself. The bonfire (what was left of it) was straight in front. He was in fact fighting in the very doorway of the stable, for it had been opened and two Calormenes were holding the door, ready to slam it shut the moment he was inside. He remembered everything now, and he realized that the enemy had been edging him to the stable on purpose ever since the fight began. And while he was thinking this he was still fighting the Tarkaan as hard as he could.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然之间，一切又变得相当清楚了。他发现自己正在跟那泰坎作战。篝火（残余的那点儿火焰）在他的正前方。事实上，他正在马厩的门口作战，因为马厩的门洞开着，两个卡乐门士兵掌握着门，准备在他刚进门的瞬间立刻把门关上。现在他把一切都记起来了，他认识到敌人从战斗刚开始时起，便一直存心要把他逐渐逼到马厩那儿去。他想到这一点时，仍在同泰坎作战，他尽力拼搏。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Seven Kings and Queens stood before him, all with crowns on their heads and all in glittering clothes, but the Kings wore fine mail as well and had their swords drawn in their hands. Tirian bowed courteously and was about to speak when the youngest of the Queens laughed. He stared hard at her face, and then gasped with amazement, for he knew her. It was Jill: but not Jill as he had last seen her, with her face all dirt and tears and an old drill dress half slipping off one shoulder. Now she looked cool and fresh, as fresh as if she had just come from bathing. And at first he thought she looked older, but then didn't, and he could never make up his mind on that point. And then he saw that the youngest of the Kings was Eustace: but he also was changed as Jill was changed.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="然而，从塔什的背后，突然响起了一个声音，洪大而又平静，犹如夏天的海涛。这声音说道：“我们以阿斯兰和阿斯兰的祖父海外皇帝的名义命令你：来吧，妖怪，带着你合法的牺牲品回到你自己的地方去吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tirian had no need to ask which was the High King, for he remembered his face (though here it was far nobler) from his dream. He stepped forward, sank on one knee and kissed Peter's hand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="蒂莲无需问谁是至尊王，因为他记得他梦中所见的脸，尽管现在见到的脸更加雍容华贵。他走上一步，跪下一膝，吻彼得的手。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tirian suddenly felt awkward about coming among these people with the blood and dust and sweat of a battle still on him. Next moment he realized that he was not in that state at all. He was fresh and cool and clean, and dressed in such clothes as he would have worn for a great feast at Cair Paravel. (But in Narnia your good clothes were never your uncomfortable ones. They knew how to make things that felt beautiful as well as looking beautiful in Narnia: and there was no such thing as starch or flannel or elastic to be found from one end of the country to the other.)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="蒂莲突然觉得：身上还留着战争的血、汗和尘土来到这些国王与女王面前，真是尴尬，但转瞬之间他就发觉自己压根儿不是处在这种境况里。他也是清洁凉爽、气色极好，身上穿着他在凯尔帕拉维尔赴宴时穿的那种衣服。（但，在纳尼亚，好衣服绝不是你们那种口叫人不舒服的衣服。在纳尼亚，他们懂得怎样把衣服做得外观美丽而又感觉舒适。从国内这一头到那一头，你找不到像浆衣服的淀粉、法兰绒以及松紧带之类的东西。）">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And the High King raised him and kissed him on both cheeks as a High King should. Then he led him to the eldest of the Queens -- but even she was not old, and there were no grey hairs on her head and no wrinkles on her cheek -- and said, "Sir, this is that Lady Polly who came into Narnia on the First Day, when Aslan made the trees grow and the Beasts talk." He brought him next to a man whose golden beard flowed over his breast and whose face was full of wisdom. "And this," he said, "is the Lord Digory who was with her on that day. And this is my brother, King Edmund: and this my sister, the Queen Lucy."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="至尊王扶他起来，吻他的双颊；按规矩，至尊王应该如此。然后至尊王引他觐见最老的女王——但，连她也年纪不大，她的头上没有白发，她的面颊上没有皱纹——他说：“阁下，这位是波莉夫人，阿斯兰使树木生长、野兽说人话的第一天，她就到纳尼亚来了。”其次，至尊王引他去见一个男子汉，金色长须飘拂在胸前，脸上充满智慧。“这位是我的弟弟，爱德蒙国王，这一位是我的妹妹，露茜女王。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes," said Eustace, "and whenever you've tried to get her to come and talk about Narnia or do anything about Narnia, she says, `What wonderful memories you have! Fancy your still thinking about all those funny games we used to play when we were children.'"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，”尤斯塔斯说，“不论什么时候，你试图叫她来谈谈纳尼亚或者为纳尼亚做点儿什么事情，她总是说：‘你们的记忆何等神奇！真想不到你们竞仍旧想着我们在儿童时期经常玩的那些个有趣的游戏。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Grown-up, indeed," said the Lady Polly. "I wish she would grow up. She wasted all her school time wanting to be the age she is now, and she'll waste all the rest of her life trying to stay that age. Her whole idea is to race on to the silliest time of one's life as quick as she can and then stop there as long as she can."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“长大成人，真是的，”波莉夫人说道，“我但愿她会长大成人。她浪费了她所有的在学校里读书的光阴，一心要达到她现在的年龄，并且竭力要停止在现在的年龄而将会浪费她一生其余的光阴。她的整个儿意图是：尽其所能地赶快跑到人生最傻里傻气的阶段，而且尽其所能地长久停留在这个阶段里。”">查看中文翻译</div>
