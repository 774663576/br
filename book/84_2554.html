<div class="line_en">"She must have glimpsed something slithering in the weeds," Mother would say when she told the story, "because she chucked Grandpa clean off." There was an old set of harrows behind him. Grandpa flew into them and a disc caved in his forehead.</div>

<div class="line_en">When Grandpa was a younger man, he had spent a hot summer on the mountain, riding the white mare he used for cowboy work. She was a tall horse, calmed with age. To hear Mother tell it that mare was steady as a rock, and Grandpa didn't pay much attention when he rode her. He'd drop the knotted reins if he felt like it, maybe to pick a burr out of his boot or sweep off his red cap and wipe his face with his shirtsleeve. The mare stood still. But tranquil as she was, she was terrified of snakes.</div>

<div class="line_en">What exactly it was that shattered Grandpa's skull changed every time I heard the story. In some tellings it was harrows, but in others it was a rock.

<div class="line_en">From the upper pasture to the house is a distance of a mile -- rocky terrain with steep, unforgiving hills, which Grandpa could not have managed in his condition. But there he was. Grandma heard a faint scratching at the door, and when she opened it there was Grandpa, lying in a heap, his brains dripping out of his head. She rushed him to town and they fitted him with a metal plate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从山上的牧场到家有一英里的距离——岩石地形，山丘陡峭无情——在爷爷当时的状态下不可能办到。但他办到了。奶奶听到一阵微弱的抓门声，当她打开门，爷爷蜷缩成一团躺在那里，他的脑浆正从脑袋里滴出来。她急忙把他送到镇上，他们给他安装了一块金属板。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After Grandpa was home and recovering, Grandma went looking for the white mare. She walked all over the mountain but found her tied to the fence behind the corral, tethered with an intricate knot that nobody used except her father, Lott.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sometimes, when I was at Grandma's eating the forbidden cornflakes and milk, I'd ask Grandpa to tell me how he got off the mountain. He always said he didn't know. Then he'd take a deep breath -- long and slow, like he was settling into a mood rather than a story -- and he'd tell the whole tale from start to finish. Grandpa was a quiet man, near silent. You could pass a whole afternoon clearing fields with him and never hear ten words strung together. Just "Yep" and "Not that one" and "I reckon so."</div>

<div class="line_en">"But I tell you this," Grandpa would say, taking off his hat and running his fingers over the dent in his skull. "I heard things while I was lyin' in them weeds. Voices, and they was talking. I recognized one, because it was Grandpa Lott. He was a tellin' somebody that Albert's son was in trouble. It was Lott sayin' that, I know it sure as I know I'm standing here." Grandpa's eyes would shine a bit, then he'd say, "Only thing is, Lott had been dead near ten years."</div>

<div class="line_en">The dent was unsightly, a two-inch crater in his forehead. As a child, when I looked at it, sometimes I imagined a tall doctor in a white coat banging on a sheet of metal with a hammer.

<div class="line_en">This part of the story called for reverence. Mother and Grandma both loved to tell it but I liked Mother's telling best. Her voice hushed in the right places.

<div class="line_en">The car crusher was coming. I suppose he wanted to remove that last fuel tank, but I can't imagine what possessed him to light his torch without first draining the fuel. I don't know how far he got, how many of the iron belts he managed to sever, before a spark from the torch made it into the tank. But I know Dad was standing next to the car, his body pressed against the frame, when the tank exploded.</div>

<div class="line_en">He was wearing a long-sleeved shirt, leather gloves and a welding shield. His face and fingers took the brunt of the blast. The heat from the explosion melted through the shield as if it were a plastic spoon. The lower half of his face liquefied: the fire consumed plastic, then skin, then muscle. The same process was repeated with his fingers -- the leather gloves were no match for the inferno that passed over and through them -- then tongues of flame licked across his shoulders and chest. When he crawled away from the flaming wreckage, I imagine he looked more like a corpse than a living man.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他穿着长袖衬衫，戴着皮手套和焊接防护罩。他的脸和手指在爆炸中首当其冲。爆炸产生的热量让防护罩像塑料勺一样熔化了。他的下半张脸液化了：火先吞噬了塑料，接着是皮肤，然后是肌肉。手指也一样——皮手套根本抵挡不住吞噬一切的地狱之火——火舌舔过他的肩膀和胸膛。当他从燃烧的残骸中爬出来时，我猜他看起来更像一具尸体，而不是一个活人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">My cousin Kylie was working for my mother that day, filling vials of essential oil. A few other women worked nearby, weighing dried leaves or straining tinctures. Kylie heard a soft tap on the back door, as if someone was bumping it with their elbow. She opened it but has no memory of what was on the other side. "I've blocked it out," she would later tell me. "I can't remember what I saw. I only remember what I thought, which was, He has no skin."</div>

<div class="line_en">Like Kylie, I don't remember what I saw when I first looked at my father. I know that when Mother had removed the gauze that morning, she'd found that his ears were so burned, the skin so glutinous, they had fused to the syrupy tissue behind them. When I walked through the back door, the first thing I saw was Mother grasping a butter knife, which she was using to pry my father's ears from his skull. I can still picture her gripping the knife, her eyes fixed, focused, but where my father should be, there's an aperture in my memory.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="和凯莉一样，我也不记得第一眼见到父亲时的情景了。我知道那天早上母亲摘下纱布时，发现他的耳朵烧伤严重，皮肤很黏，已经和后面的糖浆状组织粘在了一起。当我走进后门，首先映入眼帘的是母亲手拿一把黄油刀，正用它把父亲的耳朵从头骨里撬出来。我仍清楚地记得她手握刀子两眼专注的样子，但关于我父亲的样子，我的记忆出现了一个空洞。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The smell in the room was powerful -- of charred flesh, and of comfrey, mullein and plantain. I watched Mother and Audrey change his remaining bandages. They began with his hands. His fingers were slimy, coated in a pale ooze that was either melted skin or pus. His arms were not burned and neither were his shoulders or back, but a thick swath of gauze ran over his stomach and chest. When they removed it, I was pleased to see large patches of raw, angry skin. There were a few craters from where the flames must have concentrated in jets. They gave off a pungent smell, like meat gone to rot, and were filled with white pools.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="房间里气味浓烈——烧焦的肉、紫草、毛蕊花和车前草的气味混合在一起。我看着母亲和奥黛丽给他换剩余的绷带。她们从他的手开始。他的手指黏糊糊的，裹着一层灰白的泥状物，不是熔化的皮肤就是脓。他的手臂没有烧伤，肩膀和背部也没事，但腹部和胸部裹了厚厚一层纱布。她们把纱布拿掉时，我很欣慰地看到里面还有大片粗糙发红的皮肤。那里有几个火山口样的伤口，一定是火苗集中燃烧的地方。它们散发出一股刺鼻的气味，就像腐烂的肉，里面全是白色的脓水。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Once, an hour before dawn, his breath left him and I was sure it was the end: he was dead and would not be raised. I rested my hand on a small patch of bandages while Audrey and Mother rushed around me, chanting and tapping. The room was not at peace, or maybe it's just that I wasn't. For years my father and I had been locked in conflict, an endless battle of wills. I thought I had accepted it, accepted our relationship for what it was.

<div class="line_en">I watched his chest, prayed for him to breathe, but he didn't. Then too much time had passed. I was preparing to move away, to let my mother and sister say goodbye, when he coughed -- a brittle, rasping hack that sounded like crepe paper being crinkled. Then, like Lazarus reanimated, his chest began to rise and fall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我看着他的胸膛，祈祷他能再次呼吸，但他没有。很长时间过去了，我正准备离开，让母亲和姐姐前来告别，这时他咳嗽了一声——一声沙哑、粗涩的轻咳，听上去像绉纸被弄皱的声音。接着，像拉撒路[15]复活一样，他的胸部开始起伏。【注：[15]Lazarus，《圣经·约翰福音》中记载的人物，他病危时没等到耶稣的救治就死了，但耶稣断言他将复活。四天后拉撒路果然从山洞里走出来，证明了耶稣的神迹。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tyler flew in from Purdue. He took over for Mother, changing the bandages on Dad's fingers every morning, scraping away the layers of skin and muscle that had necrotized during the night. It didn't hurt. The nerves were dead. "I scraped off so many layers," Tyler told me, "I was sure that one morning I'd hit bone."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="泰勒从普渡坐飞机赶来。他接替了母亲的工作，每天早上给爸爸的手指换绷带，刮掉夜里坏死的皮肤和肌肉。神经已经坏死，并不疼。“我刮掉了那么多层，”泰勒告诉我说，“某天早上肯定会刮到骨头。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I told Mother I was leaving. Dad might survive, I said. And if he does, strep can't be what kills him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dad's fingers began to bow, bending unnaturally backward at the joint. This was because the tendons had begun to shrivel and contract. Tyler tried to curl Dad's fingers, to elongate the tendons and prevent the deformity from becoming permanent, but Dad couldn't bear the pain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爸爸的手指开始扭曲，关节处不自然地向后弯。这是因为肌腱开始萎缩。泰勒试着卷曲爸爸的手指，以拉伸肌腱，防止永久性畸形，但爸爸忍受不了疼痛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mother's business came to a halt. The women who worked for her stopped concocting tinctures and bottling oils and instead made vats of salve -- a new recipe, of comfrey, lobelia and plantain, that Mother had concocted specifically for my father. Mother smeared the salve over Dad's upper body twice a day. I don't remember what other treatments they used, and I don't know enough about the energy work to give an account. I know they went through seventeen gallons of salve in the first two weeks, and that Mother was ordering gauze in bulk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="母亲的生意陷入停顿。为她工作的妇女不再调制酊剂、给精油装瓶，转而制作桶装药膏——母亲专门为父亲调制的一种新配方，由紫草、半边莲和车前草制成。母亲每日两次用药膏涂满爸爸的上半身。我不记得她们是否还用过其他疗法，我对能量疗法也不够了解，无法给出解释。我只知道她们在前两周就用掉了十七加仑的药膏，母亲还订购了大批纱布。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I came back to Buck's Peak when I was sure the strep was gone. I sat by Dad's bed, dripping teaspoons of water into his mouth with a medical dropper and feeding him pureed vegetables as if he were a toddler. He rarely spoke. The pain made it difficult for him to focus; he could hardly get through a sentence before his mind surrendered to it. Mother offered to buy him pharmaceuticals, the strongest analgesics she could get her hands on, but he declined them. This was the Lord's pain, he said, and he would feel every part of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在确信链球菌已经消失后，我又回到了巴克峰。我坐在爸爸的床边，用滴管将几茶匙水滴到他嘴里，喂他吃蔬菜泥，仿佛他还是个蹒跚学步的孩子。他很少说话。疼痛使他难以集中注意力；不等他说完一句话，他的脑子就让步了。母亲提议去给他买药，买她能买到的最强劲的止痛药，但他拒绝了。这是上帝的痛苦，他说，他要全部感受到。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">While I was away, I had scoured every video store within a hundred miles until I'd found the complete box set of The Honeymooners. I held it up for Dad. He blinked to show me he'd seen it. I asked if he wanted to watch an episode. He blinked again. I pushed the first tape into the VCR and sat beside him, searching his warped face, listening to his soft whimpers, while on the screen Alice Kramden outfoxed her husband again and again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不在家时，我搜遍了方圆一百英里内的所有音像店，终于找到了全套的《蜜月期》。我举起它给爸爸看。他眨眨眼示意看到了。我问他是否想看一集。他又眨了眨眼。我将第一盘录像带塞进录像机，坐在他旁边，打量着他那张扭曲的脸，听着他轻柔的呜咽。与此同时，屏幕上的爱丽丝·卡拉门登一次又一次智胜了丈夫。">查看中文翻译</div>
