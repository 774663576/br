<div class="line_en">She had got up very early in the morning and had worked hard in the garden and she was tired and sleepy, so as soon as Martha had brought her supper and she had eaten it, she was glad to go to bed. As she laid her head on the pillow she murmured to herself :</div>

Even when she pressed her hands more tightly over her ears she could not keep the awful sounds out. She hated them so and was so terrified by them that suddenly they began to make her angry and she felt as if she should like to fly into a tantrum herself and frighten him as he was frightening her. She was not used to any one's tempers but her own. She took her hands from her ears and sprang up and stamped her foot.</div>

Every rib could be counted and every joint of the spine, though Mistress Mary did not count them as she bent over and examined them with a solemn savage little face. She looked so sour and old-fashioned that the nurse turned her head aside to hide the twitching of her mouth. There was just a minute's silence, for even Colin tried to hold his breath while Mary looked up and down his spine, and down and up, as intently as if she had been the great doctor from London.</div>

<div class="line_en">"There's not a single lump there!" she said at last. "There's not a lump as big as a pin -- except backbone lumps, and you can only feel them because you're thin.

If you ever say there is again, I shall laugh!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“一个包都没有！”最后她说，“针尖大的包都没有——除了背脊骨上的包，你能摸到它们因为你太瘦了。我自己背脊骨上也有包，过去和你的一样凸出，直到我开始长肉，我的肉还不够把它们盖起来。针尖大的包都没有！要是你再说有，我就要笑了！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">No one but Colin himself knew what effect those crossly spoken childish words had on him. If he had ever had any one to talk to about his secret terrors-if he had ever dared to let himself ask questions-if he had had childish companions and had not lain on his back in the huge closed house, breathing an atmosphere heavy with the fears of people who were most of them ignorant and tired of him, he would have found out that most of his fright and illness was created by himself But he had lain and thought of himself and his aches and weariness for hours and days and months and years. And now that an angry unsympathetic little girl insisted obstinately that he was not as ill as he thought he was he actually felt as if she might be speaking the truth.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh, Mary!" he said. "Oh, Mary! If I could get into it I think I should live to grow up! Do you suppose that instead of singing the Ayah song-you could just tell me softly as you did that first day what you imagine it looks like inside? I am sure it will make me go to sleep."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，玛丽！”他说，“噢，玛丽！要是我能进去，我想我就能活到长大！你觉得能不能不唱奶妈的歌——你可以告诉我，你想像里面看起来是什么样？就像你第一天那样轻声告诉我。我肯定这能让我睡着。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I think it has been left alone so long-that it has grown all into a lovely tangle. I think the roses have climbed and climbed and climbed until they hang from the branches and walls and creep over the ground-almost like a strange gray mist. Some of them have died but many-are alive and when the summer comes there will be curtains and fountains of roses. I think the ground is full of daffodils and snowdrops and lilies and iris working their way out of the dark. Now the spring has begun -- perhaps -- perhaps --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我想它被孤零零放了那么久——到处都长成了好看的缠结。我想玫瑰都已经爬啊爬啊爬啊，直到它们从树枝和墙头上垂挂下来，爬满地上——几乎像是一层奇特的灰雾。有些已经死了，可是很多——还活着，等夏天来了，会有一道道玫瑰帘子、玫瑰喷泉。我想地上满是旱水仙、雪花莲、百合花、鸢尾花，再黑暗里起劲往外长。现在春天已经开始了——也许——也许——”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Perhaps they are coming up through the grass -- perhaps there are clusters of purple crocuses and gold ones -- even now. Perhaps the leaves are beginning to break out and uncurl-and perhaps-the gray is changing and a green gauze veil is creeping -- and creeping over-everything. And the birds are coming to look at it -- because it is-so safe and still. And perhaps -- perhaps -- perhaps --" very softly and slowly indeed, "the robin has found a mate-and is building a nest."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“也许它们会从草里长出来——也许会有一簇簇的紫色番红花，还有红色的——甚至现在就有。也许叶子刚刚开始冒出来，舒展开——也许——灰色在变化，绿色的薄薄面正在爬着——爬满了——每样东西。鸟儿来看秘密花园——因为那里——那么安全又安宁。也许——也许——也许——”实在很温柔很缓慢，“知更鸟找到了媳妇——正在筑巢。”">查看中文翻译</div>
