<div class="line_en">If the Milk Men thought her such a savage, she would dress the part for them. When she went to the stables, she wore faded sandsilk pants and woven grass sandals. Her small breasts moved freely beneath a painted Dothraki vest, and a curved dagger hung from her medallion belt. Jhiqui had braided her hair Dothraki fashion, and fastened a silver bell to the end of the braid. "I have won no victories," she tried telling her handmaid when the bell tinkled softly.</div>

<div class="line_en">That was Drogon's victory, not mine, Dany wanted to say, but she held her tongue. The Dothraki would esteem her all the more for a few bells in her hair. She chimed as she mounted her silver mare, and again with every stride, but neither Ser Jorah nor her bloodriders made mention of it. To guard her people and her dragons in her absence, she chose Rakharo. Jhogo and Aggo would ride with her to the waterfront.</div>

<div class="line_en">They left the marble palaces and fragrant gardens behind and made their way through a poorer part of the city where modest brick houses turned blind walls to the street. There were fewer horses and camels to be seen, and a dearth of palanquins, but the streets teemed with children, beggars, and skinny dogs the color of sand. Pale men in dusty linen skirts stood beneath arched doorways to watch them pass. They know who I am, and they do not love me. Dany could tell from the way they looked at her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们将大理石宫殿和芬芳花园抛在身后，穿过城市的贫民区。这里只有朴素的砖瓦房，临街一面连窗户也无。马匹和骆驼尚且稀罕，舆车自不必说。街上多的是儿童、乞丐和骨瘦如柴的沙色狗。肤色白皙的居民穿着灰尘仆仆的亚麻裙站在拱门下目送他们经过。他们知道我是谁，并且不爱我，丹妮从他们的眼神里看得出。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was not by choice that she sought the waterfront. She was fleeing again. Her whole life had been one long flight, it seemed. She had begun running in her mother's womb, and never once stopped. How often had she and Viserys stolen away in the black of night, a bare step ahead of the Usurper's hired knives? But it was run or die. Xaro had learned that Pyat Pree was gathering the surviving warlocks together to work ill on her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="去码头并非她自愿，而是另一次逃亡。她的人生就是一场漫长的逃亡。打从娘胎起，就没有休止，不曾停下。有多少次，她和韦赛里斯在漆黑的夜晚偷偷溜走，仅仅领先篡夺者的刺客一步之遥？不逃就是死。札罗获悉，俳雅·菩厉把幸存的男巫招集到一起，要对她不利。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ser Jorah would sooner have tucked her inside her palanquin, safely hidden behind silken curtains, but she refused him. She had reclined too long on satin cushions, letting oxen bear her hither and yon. At least when she rode she felt as though she was getting somewhere.</div>

<div class="line_en">Xaro looked troubled. "And so it was, then. But now? I am less certain. It is said that the glass candles are burning in the house of Urrathon Night-Walker, that have not burned in a hundred years. Ghost grass grows in the Garden of Gehane, phantom tortoises have been seen carrying messages between the windowless houses on Warlock's Way, and all the rats in the city are chewing off their tails. The wife of Mathos Mallarawan, who once mocked a warlock's drab moth-eaten robe, has gone mad and will wear no clothes at all. Even fresh-washed silks make her feel as though a thousand insects were crawling on her skin. And Blind Sybassion the Eater of Eyes can see again, or so his slaves do swear. A man must wonder." He sighed. "These are strange times in Qarth. And strange times are bad for trade. It grieves me to say so, yet it might be best if you left Qarth entirely, and sooner rather than later." Xaro stroked her fingers reassuringly. "You need not go alone, though. You have seen dark visions in the Palace of Dust, but Xaro has dreamed brighter dreams. I see you happily abed, with our child at your breast. Sail with me around the jade Sea, and we can yet make it so! It is not too late. Give me a son, my sweet song of joy!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="札罗却忧心忡忡，“本来确实如此，但现在起了变化。据说熄灭一百年之久的玻璃蜡烛又在‘夜行者’厄拉松的宅子里重新燃烧，鬼草在吉海因花园中生长。人们看见幻影龟在男巫大道的无窗房子之间传递消息，而城里所有老鼠纷纷咬掉自己的尾巴。马索斯·马拉若文的老婆曾经嘲笑一个男巫虫蛀的袍子，可现在她发了疯，什么衣服都不肯穿，因为最新鲜的丝绸都让她感觉有成千只虫子在上面爬。人称‘食眼者’的瞎子赛比欣又能视物了，至少他的奴隶们如此发誓。这些情况怎不让人疑惑呢？”他叹口气。“魁尔斯处于非常时期，非常时期对贸易不利。我很难过地奉劝您，彻底地离开魁尔斯，宜早不宜迟。”札罗抚摸她的手指，以示安慰。“但您不会孤单。你在尘埃之殿看到黑暗的景象，札罗的梦境却一片光明。我梦见您喜乐地躺在床上，将我们的孩子抱在胸口。现在还不晚，跟我一起去玉海航行，让美梦成真！给我一个儿子吧，我可爱的天堂之星！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Well, perhaps it was time. The people of her khalasar had welcomed the chance to recover from the ravages of the red waste, but now that they were plump and rested once again, they began to grow unruly. Dothraki were not accustomed to staying long in one place. They were a warrior people, not made for cities. Perhaps she had lingered in Qarth too long, seduced by its comforts and its beauties. It was a city that always promised more than it would give you, it seemed to her, and her welcome here had turned sour since the House of the Undying had collapsed in a great gout of smoke and flame. Overnight the Qartheen had come to remember that dragons were dangerous. No longer did they vie with each other to give her gifts. Instead the Tourmaline Brotherhood had called openly for her expulsion, and the Ancient Guild of Spicers for her death. It was all Xaro could do to keep the Thirteen from joining them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="好吧，是时候了。从前她的卡拉萨在红色荒原饱受折磨，需要时间恢复元气，而今他们精力充沛，已经开始不耐烦了。多斯拉克人不习惯在一地久留，他们是马上民族，不适合居住城市。也许她沉溺于魁尔斯的舒适和美丽，违背了初衷，逗留得太久。在她看来，这座城市的人总是说得多做得少，而且自从不朽之殿在巨大的烟雾与火焰中倾覆以来，之前受的欢迎也开始改变。一夜之间，魁尔斯人忆起龙的危险，便不再竞相献礼。相反，碧玺兄弟会公开呼吁把她驱逐，香料古公会则要将她处死。札罗竭尽全力才制止十三巨子加入他们的行列。">查看中文翻译</div>

Winesinks, warehouses, and gaming dens lined the streets, cheek by jowl with cheap brothels and the temples of peculiar gods. Cutpurses, cutthroats, spellsellers, and moneychangers mingled with every crowd. The waterfront was one great marketplace where the buying and selling went on all day and all night, and goods might be had for a fraction of what they cost at the bazaar, if a man did not ask where they came from. Wizened old women bent like hunchbacks sold flavored waters and goat's milk from glazed ceramic jugs strapped to their shoulders.

Beside her, casks of wine, bales of sourleaf, and pallets of striped hides were being trundled up the gangplank onto the Bride in Azure, to sail on the evening tide. Farther along, a crowd had gathered around the Spicer galley Sunblaze to bid on slaves.

The cargomaster of the Myrish galley Silken Spirit opined that dragons were too dangerous at sea, where any stray breath of flame might set the rigging afire. The owner of Lord Faro's Belly would risk dragons, but not Dothraki. "I'll have no such godless savages in my Belly, I'll not." The two brothers who captained the sister ships Quicksilver and Greyhound seemed sympathetic and invited them into the cabin for a glass of Arbor red. They were so courteous that Dany was hopeful for a time, but in the end the price they asked was far beyond her means, and might have been beyond Xaro's.
