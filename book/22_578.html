<div class="line_en">I didn't care much for the detail of my travelling down there, and arriving at the house, all on my own. I had never been much further west before than the Cremorne Gardens, where I sometimes went with Mr Ibbs's nephews, to watch the dancing on a Saturday night. I saw the French girl cross the river on a wire from there, and almost drop -- that was something. They say she wore stockings; her legs looked bare enough to me, though. But I recall standing on Battersea Bridge as she walked her rope, and looking out, past Hammersmith, to all the countryside beyond it, that was just trees and hills and not a chimney or the spire of a church in sight -- and oh! that was a very chilling thing to see. If you had said to me then, that I would one day leave the Borough, with all my pals in it, and Mrs Sucksby and Mr Ibbs, and go quite alone, to a maid's place in a house the other side of those dark hills, I should have laughed in your face.</div>

<div class="line_en">The bookish old man, it turned out, was called Christopher Lilly. The niece's name was Maud. They lived west of London, out Maidenhead-way, near a village named Marlow, and in a house they called Briar. Gentleman's plan was to send me there alone, by train, in two days' time. He himself, he said, must stay in London for another week at least, to do the old man's business over the bindings of his books.</div>

<div class="line_en">But he answered, that there were about a hundred girls between the Strand and Piccadilly, who dined very handsomely off that story, five nights a week; and if the hard swells of London could be separated from their shillings by it, then how much kinder wasn't Miss Maud Lilly likely to be, all alone and unknowing and sad as she was, and with no-one to tell her any better?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是他回答说，在史得街和皮卡迪利大街之间至少有100个女孩子就是靠着这种谎言每周能吃上五顿不错的晚餐；如果伦敦的富豪们能从他们拥有的先令数被识别，对于一个像莫德小姐这样的女孩子，一个孤独无知悲伤而且没有人会对她说真心话的女孩子，你无法想象她能有多么的善良。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But Gentleman said I must go soon, in case the lady -- Miss Lilly -- should spoil our plot, by accidentally taking another girl to be her servant. The day after he came to Lant Street he sat and wrote her out a letter. He said he hoped she would pardon the liberty of his writing, but he had been on a visit to his old nurse -- that had been like a mother to him, when he was a boy -- and he had found her quite demented with grief, over the fate of her dead sister's daughter. Of course, the dead sister's daughter was meant to be me: the story was, that I had been maiding for a lady who was marrying and heading off for India, and had lost my place; that I was looking out for another mistress, but was meanwhile being tempted on every side to go to the bad; and that if only some soft-hearted lady would give me the chance of a situation far away from the evils of the city -- and so on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是绅说我必须立即动身，因为不这样的话李小姐可能会找到另一个女仆，那样我们的计划就泡汤了。在到兰特街的第二天，他给她写了一封信，说什么虽然贸然写信很失礼，但是还是想告诉她自己看望了自己曾经的一位年长护士——在他童年的时候，就如同母亲一般的一个人——她的心情很糟糕，为了死去的姐姐的女儿发愁。当然，这个所谓死去的姐姐的女儿就是我：他们为我安排的故事是，我曾经是一个女仆，但是呢，我以前的女主人嫁到印度去了，于是呢，我就丢了工作；我只有再设法找到另外一个女主人，但是求职的结果并不理想；这样呢，只要有一位好心的女士能够给我一个远离这个倒霉城市的女仆职位——等等云云。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">First, they washed my hair. I wore my hair then, like lots of the Borough girls wore theirs, divided in three, with a comb at the back and, at the sides, a few fat curls. If you turned the curls with a very hot iron, having first made the hair wet with sugar-and-water, you could make them hard as anything; they would last for a week like that, or longer. Gentleman, however, said he thought the style too fast for a country lady: he made me wash my hair till it was perfectly smooth, then had me divide it once -- just the once -- then pin it in a plain knot at the back of my head. He had Dainty wash her hair, too, and when I had combed and re-combed mine, and pinned and re-pinned it, until he was satisfied, he made me comb and pin hers in a matching style, as if hers was the lady's, Miss Lilly's. He fussed about us like a regular girl. When we had finished, Dainty and I looked that plain and bacon-faced, we might have been trying for places in a nunnery. John said if they would only put pictures of us in the dairies, it would be a new way of curdling milk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="首先，他们帮我洗了头发。我以前的发型是波柔女孩子的流行发式——分成三块，分别在两侧和脑后插上梳子。然后还弄了一些大卷，你先用糖水弄湿头发，再用烧红的铁烫一下，就可以得到这样的卷；这样的卷定型效果非常好，至少一个星期不会走样。但是绅说这种发型对一个乡下女孩来说太时髦了：他把我的头发洗得非常柔软，然后要我在脑后用过时的绳结揪成一团。在我反复的梳阿，揪阿，直到他满意的这段时间里，他也要戴蒂洗了头发，然后要我给她弄个和李小姐一样的发型。他教我们如何去做这些，好像他自己就是一个小姑娘。完成之后，我和戴蒂互相看着对方土里巴叽的打扮，由此我猜想我要去的大概是一个类似修道院的地方。约翰说如果把咱两的照片放在牛奶里，那些牛奶自己都会凝固起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But he was quite caught up in Gentleman's plot, despite himself. We all were. For the first time I ever knew, Mr Ibbs kept the blind pulled down on his shop door and let his brazier go cold. When people came knocking with keys to be cut, he sent them away. To the two or three thieves that brought poke, he shook his head. "Can't do it, my son. Not to-day. Got a little something cooking."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过他对绅的阴谋很感兴趣，其实不只是他，我们所有人都很感兴趣。埃比斯先生关上了店门，熄灭了火盆，这在以前是从未发生过的事情。他打发走了来配钥匙的人，摇着头对两三个来购买食物的盗贼说，“今天不成，孩子。我们这里也没什么吃的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He only had Phil come, early in the morning. He sat him down and ran him through the points of a list that Gentleman had drawn up the night before; then Phil pulled his cap down over his eyes, and left.

<div class="line_en">I had not thought of this. I wondered how it would be to have to stand and hand a pair of drawers to a strange bare girl. A strange bare girl had once run, shrieking, down Lant Street, with a policeman and a nurse behind her. Suppose Miss Lilly took fright like that, and I had to grab her? I blushed, and Gentleman saw. "Come now," he said, almost smiling. "Don't say you're squeamish?"</div>

<div class="line_en">We laughed at that; and then, when I had walked about the room to grow used to the skirt (which was narrow), and to let Dainty see where the cut was too large and needed stitching, he had me stand and try a curtsey. This was harder than it sounds. Say what you like about the kind of life I was used to, it was a life without masters: I had never curtseyed before to anyone. Now Gentleman had me dipping up and down until I thought I should be sick. He said curtseying came as natural to ladies' maids, as passing wind. He said if I would only get the trick, I should never forget it -- and he was right about that, at least, for I can still dip a proper curtsey, even now. -- Or could, if I cared to.</div>

<div class="line_en">The supper was a pig's head, stuffed at the ears -- a favourite of mine, and got in my honour. Mr Ibbs took the carving-knife to the back-door step, put up his sleeves, and stooped to sharpen the blade. He leaned with his hand on the doorpost, and I watched him do it with a queer sensation at the roots of my hair: for all up the post were cuts from where, each Christmas Day when I was a girl, he had laid the knife upon my head to see how high I'd grown. Now he drew the blade back and forth across the stone, until it sang; then he handed it to Mrs Sucksby and she dished out the meat. She always carved, in our house. An ear apiece, for Mr Ibbs and Gentleman; the snout for John and Dainty; and the cheeks, that were the tenderest parts, for herself and for me. It was all got, as I've said, in my honour. But, I don't know -- perhaps it was seeing the marks on the door-post; perhaps it was thinking of the soup that Mrs Sucksby would make, when I wouldn't be there to eat it, with the bones of the roast pig's head; perhaps it was the head itself -- which seemed to me to be grimacing, rather, the lashes of its eyes and the bristles of its snout gummed brown with treacly tears -- but as we sat about the table, I grew sad. John and Dainty wolfed their dinner down, laughing and quarrelling, now and then firing up when Gentleman teased, and now and then sulking. Mr Ibbs went neatly to work on his plate, and Mrs Sucksby went neatly to work on hers; and I picked over my bit of pork and had no appetite.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="晚餐是个猪头，佐料从耳朵处填入——这是我的最爱，也是专门为我做的。埃比斯先生把切肉刀拿到后门处，撩起袖子，弯下腰开始磨。他用一只手撑着门边梃，我看着他做这一切，全身充斥着一种奇怪的感觉：从我还是个孩子开始，每一个圣诞节他都会让我站在门梃边，把刀放在我的头顶上，看我又长了多少，并且用刀在门梃上留下记号。现在他在石头上反复拉动着刀锋，直到锋利无比；然后他把刀递给莎克斯比太太切肉。在这个屋子里，切肉永远是莎克斯比太太的工作。埃比斯先生和绅分了耳朵；猪嘴分给了约翰和戴蒂；最好的部分，猪脸，给了我和她自己。我说过，都是因为我，大家才能吃到如此美味。可是，我不知道——也许是因为看到了门梃上的记号，也许是因为想到了莎克斯比太太煮的汤，此时我并不想这里吃这个带着骨头的烤猪头；也许是因为这个猪头本身——在我看来它似乎扮着鬼脸，甚至是它愤怒的眼神或者猪嘴上的毛——由于泪水凝结在其上而呈褐色——无论如何当我们一起坐在餐桌边的时候，我变得很沮丧。约翰和戴蒂很快就狼吞虎咽的消灭了他们的晚餐，开始吵吵闹闹，偶尔由于绅的奚落而大发雷霆，偶尔小怒。埃比斯先生和莎克斯比太太动作优雅地享用着他们的晚餐；我反复拨弄着自己盘子里的肉，毫无胃口。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I gave half to Dainty. She gave it to John. He snapped his jaws and howled, like a dog. And then, when the plates were cleared away Mr Ibbs beat the eggs and the sugar and the rum, to make flip. He filled seven glasses, took the irons from the brazier, waved them for a second to take the sting of the heat off, then plunged them in. Heating the flip was like setting fire to the brandy on a plum pudding -- everyone liked to see it done and hear the drinks go hiss. John said, "Can I do one, Mr Ibbs?" -- his face red from the supper, and shiny like paint, like the face of a boy in a picture in a toy-shop window.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was like stepping out of heaven, I always thought, to leave our kitchen on a winter's night. Even so, when I had left the food beside Mr Ibbs's sleeping sister and seen to one or two of the babies, that had woken with the sounds of the dancing below, I did not go back to join the others. I walked the little way along the landing, to the door of the room I shared with Mrs Sucksby; and then I went up the next pair of stairs, to the little attic I had been born in.</div>

He always slept here, when he came to visit; though he might have made a bed with Mr Ibbs, down in the kitchen. I know which place I would have chosen. On the floor sagged his high leather boots, that he had scraped the mud from and shined. Beside them was his bag, with more white linen spilling from it. On the seat of a chair were some coins from his pocket, a packet of cigarettes, and sealing-wax. The coins were light. The wax was brittle, like toffee.</div>

I could still catch Mr Ibbs's whistle and the bounce of Dainty's feet, but before me the streets of the Borough were dark. There was only here and there a feeble light at a window like mine, and then the lantern of a coach, throwing shadows; and then a person, running hard against the cold, quick and dark as the shadows, and as quickly come and gone. I thought of all the thieves that must be there, and all the thieves' children; and then of all the regular men and women who lived their lives -- their strange and ordinary lives -- in other houses, other streets, in the brighter parts of London. I thought of Maud Lilly, in her great house. She did not know my name -- I had not known hers, three days before.

I heard her walk to the bedrooms below, and look for me there; then there was a silence, then her feet again, upon the attic stairs, and then came the light of her candle.

Come up!", and Mr Ibbs stopping once to rub a bit of butter on his lips, to keep the whistle sweet.</div>

<div class="line_en">Next day, at midday, was when I left them. I packed all my bits of stuff into the canvas-covered trunk and wore the plain brown dress and the cloak and, over my flat hair, a bonnet. I had learned as much as Gentleman could teach me after three days' work. I knew my story and my new name -- Susan Smith. There was only one more thing that needed to be done, and as I sat taking my last meal in that kitchen -- which was bread and dried meat, the meat rather too dried, and clinging to my gums -- Gentleman did it. He brought from his bag a piece of paper and a pen and some ink, and wrote me out a character. He wrote it off in a moment. Of course, he was used to faking papers. He held it up for the ink to dry, then read it out. It began:</div>

We stood beneath the ticking clock, fidgeting and blowing on our hands. They had lit the great lamps there, but the fog having come in and mixed with the steam, it drifted from arch to arch and made the light very poor. The walls were hung with black, from the death of Prince Albert; the crape had got streaked by birds. I thought it very gloomy, for so grand a place. And of course, there was a vast press of people beside us, all waiting and cursing, or jostling by, or letting their children and their dogs run into our legs.</div>

I heard a whistle blown as I was tidying my skirts; and when I got back, I found the guard had sent out the word and half the crowd had started up and was making in a great sweating rush for the waiting train. We went with them, Gentleman leading me to a second-class coach, then handing up my trunk to the man who was fixing the bags and boxes on the roof. I took a place beside a white-faced woman with a baby on her arm; across from her were two stout farmer-types. I think she was glad to see me get on, for of course, me being dressed so neat and comely, she couldn't tell -- ha ha! -- that I was a thieving Borough girl. Behind me came a boy and his old dad, with a canary in a cage. The boy sat beside the farmers. The old dad sat by me.

And when the trees and the bushes seemed just about at their thickest, and the sky was blacker than I should have thought a sky naturally could be, the train stopped a final time; and that was Marlow.</div>

<div class="line_en">The building I had thought was Briar was only the lodge! I stared, saying nothing, and we drove on past it, between two rows of bare dark trees, that curved as the road curved, then dipped into a kind of hollow, where the air -- that had seemed to clear a little, on the open country lanes -- grew thick again.

<div class="line_en">Then the dampness passed away. I looked, and stared again. The road had risen, we had broken out from between the lines of trees into a gravel clearing, and here -- rising vast and straight and stark out of the woolly fog, with all its windows black or shuttered, and its walls with a dead kind of ivy clinging to them, and a couple of its chimneys sending up threads of a feeble-looking grey smoke -- here was Briar, Maud Lilly's great house, that I must now call my home.</div>

High in one of the buildings was the round white face and great black hands of the clock I had heard striking across the fields. Beneath it, William Inker pulled the horse up, then helped me down. A door was opened in one of the walls and a woman stood gazing at us, her arms folded against the cold.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then she said that if I had finished my supper she would be pleased to show me to my room. But she would have to ask me to be very quiet as we went, for Mr Lilly liked a silent house and couldn't bear upset, and Miss Maud had a set of nerves that were just like his, that wouldn't allow of her being kept from her rest or made fretful.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后她说如果我吃完了，她很乐意带我去我的房间。但是呢，她希望我在这段路程中能够保持安静，因为李先生喜欢安静而无法忍受被打扰，而且莫德小姐也有这种习惯，不允许任何人打扰她的休息或者让她感到烦躁。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her voice and her tread grew softer the higher we went. At last, when we had climbed three pairs of stairs, she took me to a door, that she said in a whisper was the door to my room. Putting her finger before her lips, she slowly turned the handle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="越往上走，她的脚步和声音越轻柔。最后，当我们最终爬完了三套楼梯，她把我带到一扇门前，用一种耳语的声音告诉我这就是通往我卧房的门。把手指竖在唇前，她慢慢地扭开门把。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So she said; and then she took up her lamp, and I took up my candle, and she led me out into the passage and up a dark staircase. "This is the servants' way," she said as we walked, "that you must always take, unless Miss Maud directs you otherwise."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她就是这样说的；然后她拿起她的灯，我拿起我的蜡烛，她带着我穿过一条过道到达一个黑暗的楼梯前。“这是仆人通道，”她边走边说，“你必须走这条道，除非莫德小姐有其它指示。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I had never had a room of my own before. I did not particularly want one, now. But, since I must have one, this one I supposed would do. It was small and plain -- would have looked better, perhaps, for a paper garland or two, or a few plaster dogs. But there was a looking-glass upon the mantel and, before the fire, a rug. Beside the bed -- William Inker must have brought it up -- was my canvas trunk.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then I sat upon the bed. It was hard. I wondered if the sheets and blankets had been changed since the last maid left with the scarlatina. It was too dark to see. Mrs Stiles had taken her lamp and I had set my candle down in a draught: the flame of it plunged about and made great black shadows. I unfastened my cloak, but kept it draped about my shoulders. I ached, from the cold and the travelling; and the mince I had eaten had come too late -- it sat in my stomach and hurt. It was ten o'clock. We laughed at people who went to bed before midnight, at home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后我坐在床上。床很硬。我很怀疑在上一个女仆离开之后，这些床单和毯子是否被换过。屋子很黑，能见度很低。斯泰尔斯太太带走了她的灯，而我把自己的蜡烛放到地上：它的光投射到地板上成了一个大黑影。我解开斗篷，但是还是把它搭在肩上。由于寒冷和长途跋涉，我感到浑身酸痛；晚饭来的太晚了——它堵在我的胃里，很难受。现在是晚上十点。在家的时候，十二点以前上床睡觉都会遭到嘲笑的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I thought that her needle had left the scent there, of John Vroom's dog-skin coat.

<div class="line_en">I opened my trunk, to look at all the things that I had brought with me from Lant Street -- but then, none of them were really mine, they were only the petticoats and shimmies that Gentleman had made me take.

<div class="line_en">But I was never a girl for tears. I changed into my nightgown, put my cloak back on above it, and stood in my stockings and my unbuttoned shoes. I looked at the shut door at the head of the bed, and at the key-hole in it. I wondered if Maud kept a key on her side and had it turned. I wondered what I would see, if I went and bent and looked -- and who can think a thing like that, and not go and do it? But when I did go, on tiptoe, and stoop to the lock, I saw a dim light, a shadow -- nothing clearer than that, no sign of any kind of sleeping or wakeful or fretful girl, or anything.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是我从来就不是那种好哭得女孩子。我换上睡衣，重新在外面套上斗篷，穿着长袜，鞋带松散着，站立着。我看着床头附近那扇紧闭着的门，看着上面的锁孔。我想莫德小姐是不是会有一把钥匙可以打开它呢。我在想，如果从那个小孔看过去，我能看到什么呢——不去试试，是不会知道的。于是我蹑着脚走到那，趴在锁孔前，窥视，光线很暗，一切都是阴影——什么也看不清，没有睡着的或者醒着的女孩，什么也没有。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Beyond that, there was nothing -- though I listened for a minute, maybe two. Then I gave it up. I took off my shoes and my garters and got into bed: the sheets were cold and felt damp, like sheets of pastry. I put my cloak over the bed-clothes -- for extra warmth; and also so that I might quickly seize it, if someone came at me in the night and I wanted to run. You never knew. The candle I left burning. If Mr Way was to complain that that was one stub less, too bad. Even a thief has her weak points. The shadows still danced about. The pastry sheets stayed cold. The great clock sounded half-past ten -- eleven -- halfpast eleven -- twelve. I lay and shivered, and longed with all my heart for Mrs Sucksby, Lant Street, home.</div>
