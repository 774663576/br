<div class="line_en">Her fancy plunged recklessly into privileges and amusements which would have been much more becoming had she been cradled a child of fortune. With ready will and quick mental selection she scattered her meagre four-fifty per week with a swift and graceful hand. Indeed, as she sat in her rocking-chair these several evenings before going to bed and looked out upon the pleasantly lighted street, this money cleared for its prospective possessor the way to every joy and every bauble which the heart of woman may desire. "I will have a fine time," she thought.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她幻想着种种特权和享乐。要是她出身高贵人家，这些想法还切实际一些。在她的想象中，她那可怜巴巴的周薪4块半大洋已经大方潇洒地花了出去，为她买来了种种她想要的东西，种种她一眼看中的东西。真的，那几天夜里临上床前，当她坐在摇椅里愉快地看着下面灯火通明的大街时，这些还没到手的钱似乎已为未来的主人获取种种欢乐和种种女人想要的小玩意开辟了道路。“我会非常开心的，”她想道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her sister Minnie knew nothing of these rather wild cerebrations, though they exhausted the markets of delight. She was too busy scrubbing the kitchen woodwork and calculating the purchasing power of eighty cents for Sunday's dinner. When Carrie had returned home, flushed with her first success and ready, for all her weariness, to discuss the now interesting events which led up to her achievement, the former had merely smiled approvingly and inquired whether she would have to spend any of it for car fare. This consideration had not entered in before, and it did not now for long affect the glow of Carrie's enthusiasm. Disposed as she then was to calculate upon that vague basis which allows the subtraction of one sum from another without any perceptible diminution, she was happy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然嘉莉把一切可以买到的欢乐都想遍了，她姐姐敏妮一点也不知道她的这些想入非非。她忙着擦洗厨房里的木器和门窗，计算着星期天80美分的开销可以买些什么。那天嘉莉兴冲冲地回到家，因为初次成功而容光焕发。虽然很累，她很想聊聊那些现在感到很有趣的求职经过。可是敏妮只赞许地微微一笑，问她是不是在车费上要花掉一点钱。这是嘉莉没有想到的，不过这一点并没有长久地影响她的情绪。在她当时的心境下，当她模模糊糊算这笔钱的用途时，抽出一笔钱用在别的事情上，一点不让她感到总数有什么减少。她太高兴了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When Hanson came home at seven o'clock, he was inclined to be a little crusty -- his usual demeanour before supper. This never showed so much in anything he said as in a certain solemnity of countenance and the silent manner in which he slopped about. He had a pair of yellow carpet slippers which he enjoyed wearing, and these he would immediately substitute for his solid pair of shoes. This, and washing his face with the aid of common washing soap until it glowed a shiny red, constituted his only preparation for his evening meal. He would then get his evening paper and read in silence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汉生7点钟回到家时，脾气不太好——吃晚饭前他通常是这样的。他并没有说什么难听的话，但是当他在房间走动时，他板着一张脸，一言不发，他的神气流露出他的恶劣情绪。他有一双心爱的黄色拖鞋。一到家，他就脱下那双结实的皮鞋，换上拖鞋。换鞋和洗脸是他晚饭前的唯一准备工作。他用普通的洗衣皂洗脸，一直洗到脸发出红光才罢手。然后他就拿起晚报，一声不响地看起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For a young man, this was rather a morbid turn of character, and so affected Carrie. Indeed, it affected the entire atmosphere of the flat, as such things are inclined to do, and gave to his wife's mind its subdued and tactful turn, anxious to avoid taciturn replies. Under the influence of Carrie's announcement he brightened up somewhat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对于一个年轻人来说，这实在是一种不正常的性格。这使嘉莉的情绪也受到影响。其实他还影响了整个屋子的气氛。这种事往往都是这样的。在这种气氛里，他的妻子性格变得谨小慎微，处事圆活，竭力避免自讨没趣。嘉莉宣布找到了工作，才使他心情开朗了一点。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At this there was a slight halt in the natural reply. Thoughts are a strangely permeating factor. At her suggestion of going to the theatre, the unspoken shade of disapproval to the doing of those things which involved the expenditure of money -- shades of feeling which arose in the mind of Hanson and then in Minnie -- slightly affected the atmosphere of the table.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="谈话到了这里略有停顿，没人立即回答她。思想真是一种会蔓延的奇怪东西。一听到她说起戏院，先是汉生的脑子里对这种花钱的玩意大不以为然，于是敏妮的脑子里也产生了同样的想法。感情的这种无声的微妙变化影响了饭桌上的气氛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Minnie answered "yes," but Carrie could feel that going to the theatre was poorly advocated here. The subject was put off for a little while until Hanson, through with his meal, took his paper and went into the front room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="敏妮回答了一声“是的”，但是嘉莉可以感觉到看戏这想法在这个家中是不受欢迎的。这话题就暂时撇下不谈了。直到汉生吃完晚饭，拿上报纸去前屋，她们才重新提起看戏的事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Carrie wants us to go to the theatre," she said, looking in upon her husband. Hanson looked up from his paper, and they exchanged a mild look, which said as plainly as anything: "This isn't what we expected."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你去问问他嘛，”她轻声恳求道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Minnie was thinking of the resource which Carrie's board would add. It would pay the rent and would make the subject of expenditure a little less difficult to talk about with her husband. But if Carrie was going to think of running around in the beginning there would be a hitch somewhere. Unless Carrie submitted to a solemn round of industry and saw the need of hard work without longing for play, how was her coming to the city to profit them? These thoughts were not those of a cold, hard nature at all. They were the serious reflections of a mind which invariably adjusted itself, without much complaining, to such surroundings as its industry could make for it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="敏妮想的却是嘉莉在他们家搭伙，可以增加些家里的收入。这点钱可以付房租，在和她丈夫谈家庭开销时也要容易些。可是如果嘉莉一开始就想着到处去玩，事情就有点不妙了。如果嘉莉不肯吃苦耐劳，埋头干活，只想着玩乐，那么她到城里来，对他们家又有什么好处呢？她这么想并非出自天性冷漠。她是一个任劳任怨，勤勤恳恳，竭力顺应环境维持生计的人。这些想法是处在这种境遇里的人认真思索的结果。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At last she yielded enough to ask Hanson. It was a half-hearted procedure without a shade of desire on her part.</div>

<div class="line_en">On Saturday Carrie went out by herself -- first toward the river, which interested her, and then back along Jackson Street, which was then lined by the pretty houses and fine lawns which subsequently caused it to be made into a boulevard. She was struck with the evidences of wealth, although there was, perhaps, not a person on the street worth more than a hundred thousand dollars. She was glad to be out of the flat, because already she felt that it was a narrow, humdrum place, and that interest and joy lay elsewhere. Her thoughts now were of a more liberal character, and she punctuated them with speculations as to the whereabouts of Drouet. She was not sure but that he might call anyhow Monday night, and, while she felt a little disturbed at the possibility, there was, nevertheless, just the shade of a wish that he would.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="星期六嘉莉一个人出去——先朝她感兴趣的河边走去，然后沿杰克生大街回来。大街两侧是漂亮的住宅和草坪，所以这条街后来改成了林荫大道。这些象征财富的房子给她留下了深刻印象，尽管这街上没有一家财产在十万以上。离开公寓到外面走走，使她心情舒畅，因为她已经感到那个家狭隘单调，毫无趣味和欢乐可言。她的思想自由自在地飘浮，当中还不时想到杜洛埃身上，猜测着他现在会在哪里。她不能肯定他星期一晚上是否会来。她一方面担心他会来，一方面又有点盼他来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On Monday she arose early and prepared to go to work. She dressed herself in a worn shirt-waist of dotted blue percale, a skirt of light-brown serge rather faded, and a small straw hat which she had worn all summer at Columbia City. Her shoes were old, and her necktie was in that crumpled, flattened state which time and much wearing impart. She made a very average looking shop-girl with the exception of her features. These were slightly more even than common, and gave her a sweet, reserved, and pleasing appearance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="星期一她早早起来，准备去上班。她穿上了一件蓝点子细布旧上衣，一条褪了色的淡咖啡哔叽裙子，和一顶她在哥伦比亚城戴了一夏天的小草帽。她的鞋子也是旧的，领带已经又皱又扁。除了相貌以外，她看上去就像一个普通女工。她比一般姑娘来得美貌。给人一种可爱甜美，端庄动人的印象。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It is no easy thing to get up early in the morning when one is used to sleeping until seven and eight, as Carrie had been at home. She gained some inkling of the character of Hanson's life when, half asleep, she looked out into the dining-room at six o'clock and saw him silently finishing his breakfast. By the time she was dressed he was gone, and she, Minnie, and the baby ate together, the latter being just old enough to sit in a high chair and disturb the dishes with a spoon. Her spirits were greatly subdued now when the fact of entering upon strange and untried duties confronted her. Only the ashes of all her fine fancies were remaining -- ashes still concealing, nevertheless, a few red embers of hope. So subdued was she by her weakening nerves, that she ate quite in silence going over imaginary conceptions of the character of the shoe company, the nature of the work, her employer's attitude. She was vaguely feeling that she would come in contact with the great owners, that her work would be where grave, stylishly dressed men occasionally look on.</div>

<div class="line_en">Carrie went straight forward until she crossed the river, and then turned into Fifth Avenue. The thoroughfare, in this part, was like a walled canon of brown stone and dark red brick. The big windows looked shiny and clean. Trucks were rumbling in increasing numbers; men and women, girls and boys were moving onward in all directions. She met girls of her own age, who looked at her as if with contempt for her diffidence. She wondered at the magnitude of this life and at the importance of knowing much in order to do anything in it at all. Dread at her own inefficiency crept upon her.

<div class="line_en">Once in the sunlit street, with labourers tramping by in either direction, the horse-cars passing crowded to the rails with the small clerks and floor help in the great wholesale houses, and men and women generally coming out of doors and passing about the neighbourhood, Carrie felt slightly reassured. In the sunshine of the morning, beneath the wide, blue heavens, with a fresh wind astir, what fears, except the most desperate, can find a harbourage? In the night, or the gloomy chambers of the day, fears and misgivings wax strong, but out in the sunlight there is, for a time, cessation even of the terror of death.</div>

<div class="line_en">Carrie at last could scarcely sit still. Her legs began to tire and she wanted to get up and stretch. Would noon never come? It seemed as if she had worked an entire day. She was not hungry at all, but weak, and her eyes were tired, straining at the one point where the eye-punch came down. The girl at the right noticed her squirmings and felt sorry for her. She was concentrating herself too thoroughly -- what she did really required less mental and physical strain. There was nothing to be done, however. The halves of the uppers came piling steadily down. Her hands began to ache at the wrists and then in the fingers, and towards the last she seemed one mass of dull, complaining muscles, fixed in an eternal position and performing a single mechanical movement which became more and more distasteful, until as last it was absolutely nauseating. When she was wondering whether the strain would ever cease, a dull- sounding bell clanged somewhere down an elevator shaft, and the end came. In an instant there was a buzz of action and conversation. All the girls instantly left their stools and hurried away in an adjoining room, men passed through, coming from some department which opened on the right. The whirling wheels began to sing in a steadily modifying key, until at last they died away in a low buzz. There was an audible stillness, in which the common voice sounded strange.</div>

The other girls had ranged themselves about the windows or the work- benches of those of the men who had gone out. She saw no place which did not hold a couple or a group of girls, and being too timid to think of intruding herself, she sought out her machine and, seated upon her stool, opened her lunch on her lap.

By three o'clock she was sure it must be six, and by four it seemed as if they had forgotten to note the hour and were letting all work overtime. The foreman became a true ogre, prowling constantly about, keeping her tied down to her miserable task. What she heard of the conversation about her only made her feel sure that she did not want to make friends with any of these. When six o'clock came she hurried eagerly away, her arms aching and her limbs stiff from sitting in one position.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="嘉莉什么也没说，低头开始工作。她感到她几乎无法忍受这样的生活。她原来想象的工作和这一切天差地远。整个长长的下午，她想到外面的城市，那壮观的市容和人群，那些漂亮的大楼。她又想到了哥伦比亚城，想到老家的好处。3点钟时，她肯定已是6点了。到了4点，她怀疑他们忘了看钟，让大家在加班加点了。工头成了一个魔鬼，不断在旁边巡睃，使她一动不敢动，钉在她那个倒霉的活上。她听到周围人们的谈话，这些话只让她肯定她不想和他们中的任何一个交朋友。6点钟到了，她急忙回家。她的胳膊酸痛，四肢因为坐的姿势不变已经僵硬。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She was glad when the short half hour was over and the wheels began to whirr again. Though wearied, she would be inconspicuous. This illusion ended when another young man passed along the aisle and poked her indifferently in the ribs with his thumb. She turned about, indignation leaping to her eyes, but he had gone on and only once turned to grin. She found it difficult to conquer an inclination to cry.</div>

<div class="line_en">Carrie turned her face to the west with a subdued heart. As she turned the corner, she saw through the great shiny window the small desk at which she had applied. There were the crowds, hurrying with the same buzz and energy-yielding enthusiasm. She felt a slight relief, but it was only at her escape. She felt ashamed in the face of better dressed girls who went by. She felt as though she should be better served, and her heart revolted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="嘉莉情绪低落地朝西走。转过街角，她透过大而明亮的玻璃窗又看到了那张小办公桌，她当初就是在那里申请工作的。路上到处是嘈杂的人流，他们急急走着，步履中照旧透出充沛的精力和热情。她感到稍稍松了一口气，庆幸自己逃离了那地方。她看见穿着比自己漂亮的姑娘从身边走过，就感到羞愧。她认为自己该享有更好的待遇，所以心里很不平。">查看中文翻译</div>
