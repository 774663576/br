<div class="line_en">About six years ago, I took my father into business with me, hoping it would straighten him out. I think the pressure of the job just made him worse. He's been an alcoholic for as long as I can remember. He drinks, he insults customers, and he costs me a lot of business. I've got to get him out of there, but I'm terrified. How the hell do you fire your own father? It would destroy him. Whenever I try to talk to him about it, all he says is: "You talk to me with respect or you don't talk to me at all." I'm going nuts.</div>

<div class="line_en">Glenn, a tall, rugged-looking man who owns a small manufacturing company, came to me for help primarily because his timidity and lack of assertiveness were affecting both his personal and professional relationships. He said he felt nervous and restless a great deal of the time. He had overheard someone at work call him "whiny" and "depressing." He sensed that people were uneasy when they met him, which made it difficult for him to turn acquaintances into friends.</div>

<div class="line_en">The emotional and psychological climate in alcoholic families is much the same as in families where parents abuse drugs, whether illegal or prescription. Though the cases I've chosen in this chapter focus on alcoholic parents, the painful experiences of children of drug abusers are quite similar.</div>

<div class="line_en">If Richard Nixon's White House staff had taken cover-up lessons from anyone in an alcoholic's family, "Watergate" would still be just a Washington hotel. Denial takes on gargantuan proportions for everyone living in an alcoholic household. Alcoholism is like a dinosaur in the living room. To an outsider the dinosaur is impossible to ignore, but for those within the home, the hopelessness of evicting the beast forces them to pretend it isn't there. That's the only way they can coexist. Lies, excuses, and secrets are as common as air in these homes, creating tremendous emotional chaos for children.</div>

<div class="line_en">Glenn learned early on that his father's drinking was a Big Secret. Though his mother told him not to tell people about "Daddy's problem," his shame alone would have been enough to keep his mouth shut. The family put on an "everything is fine" face to the outside world. They were united by their need to deal with their common enemy. The secret became the glue that kept the tortured family intact.</div>

<div class="line_en">My earliest memory is of my father coming home from work and heading straight for the liquor cabinet. It was his nightly ritual. After downing a few, he'd come to dinner with a glass in his hand, and the damned thing was never empty. After dinner, he'd get down to some serious drinking. We all had to be very quiet so we wouldn't disturb him. I mean, for Christ's sake, you'd think that he was doing something really important, but the son of a bitch was just getting juiced. On lots of nights, I remember my sister, my mother, and I had to drag him to bed. My job was to take off his shoes and socks. The damnedest thing was that no one in the family ever mentioned what we were doing. I mean, we did it night after night. Until I got a little older, I honestly thought that dragging Dad to bed was a normal family activity. Something every family did.</div>

<div class="line_en">The denial of the problem by the alcoholic's partner and frequently by other members of the family. They commonly excuse the drinker with excuses such as, "Mom just drinks to relax,"</div>

<div class="line_en">The charade of the "normal family," a facade that the family presents to one another and to the world.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Dad tripped on the carpet," or, "Dad lost his job because he had a mean boss."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The charade of the normal family" is especially damaging to a child because it forces him to deny the validity of his own feelings and perceptions. It is almost impossible for a child to develop a strong sense of self-confidence if he must constantly lie about what he is thinking and feeling. His guilt makes him wonder whether people believe him. When he grows older, this sense that people doubt him can continue, causing him to shy away from revealing anything of himself or venturing an opinion. Like Glenn, many adult children of alcoholics become painfully shy.</div>

<div class="line_en">This loneliness drags him deeper into the family morass. He develops an enormous and distorted sense of loyalty to the only people who share his secret: his family co-conspirators. Intense, uncritical loyalty to his parents becomes second nature. When he grows to adulthood, his blind loyalty remains a destructive, controlling element in his life. This is what prevented Glenn from asking his father to leave the company, despite the fact that his business was suffering because of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Because so much energy is expended on futile attempts to rescue the drinker and maintain the cover-up, there is little time or attention left for the basic needs of the alcoholic's children. Like children of deficient and inadequate parents, children of alcoholics often feel invisible. This becomes an especially painful catch-22 because the more troubled the home, the more the children need emotional support.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It takes a tremendous amount of energy to keep the charade going. The child must always be on guard. He lives in constant fear that he may accidentally expose and betray the family. To avoid that, he often avoids making friends and thereby becomes isolated and lonely.</div>

<div class="line_en">My father never did any of the things that my friends' fathers did with them. We never tossed a football around or even watched games together. He would always say, "I don't have time -- maybe later," but he always had time to sit around and get drunk. My mother would say, "Don't bother me all the time with your problems. Why don't you just go off with your friends." But I didn't have any friends. I was afraid to bring anybody home. My folks just ignored me and didn't seem to care what kind of trouble I got into just as long as they didn't have to deal with it.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was awful. I felt like an orphan most of the time. I would do anything to get their attention. Once, when I was around eleven, I was over at a friend's house, and his dad had left his wallet out on a table in the hallway. So I took five dollars, hoping I'd get caught. I didn't care if my parents gave me hell, as long as they'd know I was there.</div>

<div class="line_en">My dad put me down whenever I spoke up. If I dared raise my voice to him, he'd slug me. It didn't take me long to learn not to cross him. If I stood up to my mom, she'd start bawling like a baby, then he'd get mad and belt somebody, and I'd feel twice as bad for the trouble I'd caused. So I learned to stay away out of the house as much as I could. I got an after-school job when I was twelve, and I would lie about what time I got off so I could come home as late as possible every night. Then I'd leave for school an hour early in the morning, just so I could get out before he woke up. I can still feel that loneliness, sitting by myself in the schoolyard every morning, waiting for somebody to show up. The funny thing is, I don't think my parents even noticed I was never around.</div>

<div class="line_en">Glenn got the message early in life that his existence was more an aggravation than a blessing to his parents. His emotional invisibility was reinforced by the fact that it was his safest haven from his father's frequent violence. He recalled:</div>

<div class="line_en">I guess so. I can't ever say anything that offends anybody, no matter how much I want to. I swallow so many words, I think I'm going to throw up sometimes. I just can't stand up to people. Even people I couldn't care less about. If I think what I want to say is going to hurt somebody's feelings, I just can't say it. Period.</div>

<div class="line_en">I asked Glenn if he thought the same fears that had kept him from asserting himself as a child were now controlling him as an adult. Glenn admitted sadly:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As with many adult children of alcoholics, Glenn felt responsible for everyone else's feelings, just as he took responsibility for his father's and mother's feelings when he was young. He went to heroic lengths to avoid confrontations with his parents because he didn't want to be responsible for causing anyone (including himself) pain. He could not express his emotions as a child should be able to. He had to suppress them, and he continued that pattern in his adult life. When Glenn helped put his father to bed, when he took responsibility for keeping his father from getting upset, he was acting as a parent, not a child. When a child is forced to adopt the role of parent, he loses his role models, threatening his developing identity. This destructive role reversal is common in alcoholic families.</div>

<div class="line_en">As we have seen, and will continue to see, role reversal occurs in almost all families where there are toxic parents. In the alcoholic family, the drinking parent actively usurps the child's role through his pathetic, needy, irrational behavior. He's such a handful of a child himself that he leaves no room for any other children in the family.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I remember how my mother would come running to me when Dad got out of control and she'd cry about how unhappy she was. She'd say, "What am I going to do? You kids need a father, and I can't go out to work." It upsets me, just talking about it. I used to dream about taking her away to an island where my father couldn't find us. I'd promise her that as soon as I could I'd take care of her. And that's what I'm doing now. I give her money all the time, even though I can't afford it. And I'm taking care of Dad, even though it's killing my business. Why can't I find somebody to take care of me for a change?</div>

<div class="line_en">Glenn is still burdened with guilt over his inability both as a child and as an adult to fix his parents' lives. Despite his dream of finding a woman to take care of him, the woman he finally settled down with was needy and helpless. Glenn sensed that she wasn't right for him when he married her, but his need to play out the rescue fantasies of his childhood overwhelmed his better judgment.</div>

<div class="line_en">It didn't take long for Glenn to learn that he had married a secret drinker. If he had known before he married her, he probably would have married her anyway. He would simply have convinced himself that he could change her. Adult children of alcoholics frequently marry alcoholics. Many people find it bewildering that someone who grew up in the chaos of an alcoholic family would choose to relive the trauma. But the drive to repeat familiar patterns of feelings is common to all people, no matter how painful or self-defeating those feelings may be. The familiar provides a sense of comfort and structure for our lives. We know what the rules are, and we know what to expect.</div>

<div class="line_en">When I met Denise, I didn't even know she drank. When I found out, she gave up trying to hide it. I'd see her drunk three, four times a week. I begged her to stop. I took her to doctors. I pleaded with her to go to AA. I locked up all the liquor, but you know how drunks are… she'd always find a way. The only time she'd stop is when I'd threaten to leave. But after a while she'd fall off the wagon, and we'd be back to square one.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">More important, we reenact past conflicts because this time we hope to make it come out right -- we're going to win the battle. This reenactment of old, painful experiences is called a "repetition compulsion."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I can't emphasize strongly enough how much this particular compulsion dominates our lives. Almost all self-defeating behaviors, particularly those involved in establishing and maintaining intimate relationships, begin to make a lot more sense when seen in the light of repetition compulsion. Glenn provides a perfect example:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Since denial and cover-up seemed normal during his growing-up years, Glenn moved easily into an adult relationship where the same elements recurred. Only this time he thought he might succeed at rescuing his wife where he had failed, as a child, to rescue his parents. Glenn, like almost all adult children of alcoholics, had made a fervent promise to himself: he would never have another alcoholic in his life. But a deeply ingrained repetition compulsion is a lot stronger than any conscious promise can ever be.</div>

I would fuckin' plead with him to stop, but he was like a crazy man. I don't want to give you the idea that he was some kind of monster, because when he wasn't drinking, he could be cool.

At first it was exciting, but after a while I'd get pretty scared. I mean, I was just a kid, but I could tell he didn't have such great control of the car. I kept doing it because it was something I had with him that nobody else had. It was this special thing between us. I really got to like drinking because it made Dad like me more. It got worse and worse until I finally drank myself right off the deep end.</div>

<div class="line_en">Even if a child has not been actively recruited by the alcoholic, he or she remains especially vulnerable to eventually becoming an alcoholic. We don't know exactly why this happens -- there may be a genetic predisposition to addictive behavior or a biochemical disorder. I also suspect a strong factor is that many behaviors and beliefs are formed through imitation of, and identification with, our parents. Adult children of alcoholics have been handed a legacy of rage, depression, loss of joy, suspiciousness, damaged relationships, and overdeveloped sense of responsibility. They have also been handed a method of trying to deal with this twisted legacy: drinking.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At least one out of four children of alcoholic parents become alcoholics themselves, and many of these adults were given their first drink at a very young age by the alcoholic parent. The drinking creates a special and often secret bond between parent and child. This particular type of conspiracy feels like camaraderie to a child. It is often as close as the child can get to something approaching love and approval.</div>

<div class="line_en">Because their first and most important relationship taught them that the people they love will hurt them and be terrifyingly unpredictable, most adult children of alcoholics are terrified of becoming close to another person. Successful adult relationships, whether between lovers or friends, require a significant degree of vulnerability, trust, and openness -- the very elements that an alcoholic household destroys. As a result, many adult children of alcoholics are drawn to people who are emotionally unavailable because of deep conflicts of their own. In this way, the adult child can create an illusion of a relationship without confronting his or her terror of true intimacy.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jody's Jekyll and Hyde boyfriend was a repeat of her father -- sometimes wonderful, sometimes terrible. By picking a volatile and abusive man, Jody was both repeating the familiar experiences of her childhood and guaranteeing that she would never have to risk entering the uncharted waters of true intimacy. She clung desperately to the myth that her father was still the only man who really understood her. Her unwillingness to confront this myth contaminated her relationships not only with her friends but with me and with other members of her therapy group. In fact, the myth was so powerful that she eventually gave up on herself.</div>

I could tell she'd been drinking because her speech was real slurry, and she sounded like she'd been crying. She told me my dad had gone on a two-week fishing trip, and she was real depressed… and could I just stay with her for a few days. I told her I had this vacation planned and she started to cry.

I remember getting a D in history and being afraid to come home. A D was good for about four hours of being told that I was a worthless, ungrateful failure, and no man would ever want me. When I finally got home, it turned out she was in a good mood. She just signed my report card and said, "You're smart; you don't have to worry about grades." I couldn't believe it. But then she had her usual four cocktails before dinner that night. I set the table and forgot to put out the salt and pepper.

<div class="line_en">All parents are inconsistent to some degree, but the "it's right one day and wrong the next" syndrome is dramatically intensified by alcohol. Because the signals and rules change so often and unexpectedly, the child always falls short. The parent uses criticism as a means of control, so no matter what the child does, the parent will find something to criticize. The child becomes an outlet for frustration, a scapegoat for all that is wrong with his parents. This is an insidious way for alcoholic parents to justify and ventilate their own inadequacies. The message becomes: "If you wouldn't do everything wrong, Mommy wouldn't have to drink." As Carla put it:</div>

<div class="line_en">While some children of alcoholics are forced to be the scapegoat, others are cast in the role of the family hero -- the "golden child." This child is showered with approval from both parents and the outside world because of the enormous responsibility he or she is forced to assume. On the surface, this approbation would seem to put the heroic child in a much more positive environment than that of the family scapegoat, but in reality, the deprivation and the personal demons are very much the same. The golden child drives himself mercilessly to achieve unobtainable goals of perfection both in childhood and in adult life.</div>

Alcoholic families operate in a precarious balance, with everyone acting out their assigned roles. Once Carla and her mother both started actively working on their own problems, it drastically rocked the family boat. Carla's father was admired in the community as a model of devotion and loyalty. Carla remembers more than one family member saying that her father should be a candidate for sainthood because he was so forgiving and tolerant. In reality, he was a classic co-dependent who, through his denial, gave his wife permission to remain a pitiful alcoholic. He, in turn, gained power by this. As she disappeared into a drunken haze, he was free to run the family as he saw fit.</div>

Despite the powerful facade he put on for the outside world, Carla's father -- like many co-dependents -- was terribly insecure. As most of us do, he picked a partner who mirrored his true feelings about himself. Choosing an inadequate partner allowed him to feel superior by comparison.</div>

<div class="line_en">Unlike Carla's father, Glenn's mother was a co-dependent who fully acknowledged the horrors of her husband's alcoholism and the child abuse that went along with it. Nevertheless, she was no more able or willing to initiate an effective course of action. As Glenn told me:</div>

<div class="line_en">Carla's mother is now a recovering alcoholic and is making some very positive changes in her relationship with her daughter and her husband. Predictably, her husband's gastrointestinal problems continue.</div>

<div class="line_en">Glenn's mother was simply overwhelmed by the family turmoil. Her helplessness, combined with her distorted sense of loyalty, gave her husband permission to continue his outrageous behavior. Glenn's mother, like many co-dependents, in essence became a child herself, leaving the real children unprotected. To this day, Glenn is caught between his need to rescue his childlike mother and his resentment of her failure to mother him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Fairy tale endings are rare for families of alcoholics. In the best of all possible worlds, your parents would take full responsibility for their drinking, enter a treatment program, and become sober. They would validate and acknowledge the horrors of your childhood and would make an attempt to become responsible, loving parents.</div>

<div class="line_en">Glenn finally got his long-sought-after "I love you," but it wasn't enough. It left him with a sense of emptiness. It was all talk and no action. His father was still drinking. Glenn's mistake was that he was waiting for his father to change.</div>

<div class="line_en">About a year ago, my dad told me for the first time that he loved me. I gave him a hug and thanked him, but somehow it just didn't make up for all the years that he told me I was rotten. It was ironic because I'd dreamed of that day all my life.</div>

<div class="line_en">Unfortunately, the reality usually falls far short of the ideal. The drinking, the denial, and the distortion of reality often continue until one or both parents die. Many adult children of alcoholics cling to the hope that their family life will magically evolve into "Ozzie and Harriet," but holding on to this hope can only set you up for a tremendous fall. Glenn found this out in a particularly poignant way:</div>

<div class="line_en">If you're the adult child of an alcoholic, the key to taking control of your life is to remember that you can change without changing your parents. Your well-being does not have to be dependent on your parents. You can overcome the traumas of your childhood and their power over your adult life, even if your parents stay exactly the way they've always been. You just have to commit yourself to doing the work.</div>

<div class="line_en">I suggest to all my clients who came from homes where alcohol or drugs were abused that our work together could be greatly accelerated by their joining Adult Children of Alcoholics or a similar organization. These groups provide excellent support, and through the exchange of experiences and feelings, children of alcoholics and drug abusers come to realize that they are not alone. They can face up to the dinosaur in the living room, which is the first step toward driving it out.</div>
