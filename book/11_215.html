<div class="line_en">"If only that dratted wizard will leave young Frodo alone, perhaps he'll settle down and grow some hobbit-sense," they said. And to all appearance the wizard did leave Frodo alone, and he did settle down, but the growth of hobbit-sense was not very noticeable. Indeed, he at once began to carry on Bilbo's reputation for oddity. He refused to go into mourning; and the next year he gave a party in honour of Bilbo's hundred-and-twelfth birthday, which he called Hundred-weight Feast. But that was short of the mark, for twenty guests were invited and there were several meals at which it snowed food and rained drink, as hobbits say.</div>

<div class="line_en">The talk did not die down in nine or even ninety-nine days. The second disappearance of Mr. Bilbo Baggins was discussed in Hobbiton, and indeed all over the Shire, for a year and a day, and was remembered much longer than that. It became a fireside-story for young hobbits; and eventually Mad Baggins, who used to vanish with a bang and a flash and reappear with bags of jewels and gold, became a favourite character of legend and lived on long after all the true events were forgotten.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有关这事件的讨论不只持续了一周，更超过了三个月。比尔博—巴金斯第二次的神秘失踪让人在哈比屯讨论了一年多，更让人们念念不忘了好长的一段时间。这成了年轻哈比人最爱的饭后话题。到了最后，当一切的真相都已经隐入历史中时，“疯狂巴金斯”这个人物成了民间故事中最著名的角色。在故事中，他会在一声巨响和强光中消失，然后再带着装满珠宝和黄金的袋子出现。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But in the meantime, the general opinion in the neighbourhood was that Bilbo, who had always been rather cracked, had at last gone quite mad, and had run off into the Blue. There he had undoubtedly fallen into a pool or a river and come to a tragic, but hardly an untimely, end. The blame was mostly laid on Gandalf.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但在此同时，邻居们对他的观感则大有不同。他们都认为这个本来就有点疯疯癫癫的老头子这下终于崩溃了，可能跑到荒野里去了。他可能在那里跌进某个池塘或是小河里，就这样结束了一生。大多数的人都把这怪罪到甘道夫身上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As time went on, people began to notice that Frodo also showed signs of good "preservation": outwardly he retained the appearance of a robust and energetic hobbit just out of his tweens. "Some folk have all the luck," they said; but it was not until Frodo approached the usually more sober age of fifty that they began to think it queer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随着时光的流逝，人们开始注意到佛罗多似乎也继承了“养生有道”的秘诀。他外表看起来依旧像是精力充沛的少年。“有些人就是得天独厚，”他们说；但一直到了佛罗多五十岁的时候，他们才真的觉得这很诡异。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Some people were rather shocked; but Frodo kept up the custom of giving Bilbo's Birthday Party year after year until they got used to it. He said that he did not think Bilbo was dead. When they asked: "Where is he then?" he shrugged his shoulders.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有些人觉得相当吃惊，但佛罗多还是年复一年的坚持举办宴会，直到大家也见怪不怪为止。他表示自己不认为比尔博已经死了。当众人质问他比尔博的去向时，他也只能耸耸肩。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He lived alone, as Bilbo had done; but he had a good many friends, especially among the younger hobbits (mostly descendants of the Old Took) who had as children been fond of Bilbo and often in and out of Bag End. Folco Boffin and Fredegar Bolger were two of these; but his closest friends were Peregrin Took (usually called Pippin), and Merry Brandybuck (his real name was Meriadoc, but that was seldom remembered). Frodo went tramping all over the Shire with them; but more often he wandered by himself, and to the amazement of sensible folk he was sometimes seen far from home walking in the hills and woods under the starlight. Merry and Pippin suspected that he visited the Elves at times, as Bilbo had done.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他和比尔博一样都一个人住，但他依旧有许多年轻的哈比朋友。（大多数是老图克的子孙）这些人小时候就很喜欢比尔博，经常喜欢找理由往袋底洞跑。法哥—波芬和佛瑞德加—博格就是两个典型的例子。不过，他最亲近的朋友是皮瑞格林—图克（通常匿称他为皮聘），梅里—烈酒鹿（他的真名其实是梅里—雅达克，但大家都记不太起来）。佛罗多经常和他们在夏尔四处探索，但更常自己一个人四处乱逛。让一般人吃惊的是，佛罗多有时竟然会在星光下远离家门，去附近的山丘和森林散步。梅里和皮聘怀疑他和比尔博一样，都会悄悄的去拜访精灵。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Frodo himself, after the first shock, found that being his own master and the Mr. Baggins of Bag End was rather pleasant. For some years he was quite happy and did not worry much about the future. But half unknown to himself the regret that he had not gone with Bilbo was steadily growing. He found himself wondering at times, especially in the autumn, about the wild lands, and strange visions of mountains that he had never seen came into his dreams. He began to say to himself: "Perhaps I shall cross the River myself one day." To which the other half of his mind always replied: "Not yet."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在一开始的不安之后，佛罗多开始享受继承巴金斯家和袋底洞的生活。他有好几年的时间安逸的过活，丝毫不担心未来。但慢慢的，他开始后悔当初没有跟比尔博一起离开。他有时脑中会浮现一些景象，特别是在暮秋时节，他会开始想起外面的荒野、梦中会出现以往从未见过的高山峻岭。他开始对自己说：“或许有天我该亲身渡河去看看。”他脑中的另外一部份会回答：“时候还没到。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So it went on, until his forties were running out, and his fiftieth birthday was drawing near: fifty was a number that he felt was somehow significant (or ominous); it was at any rate at that age that adventure had suddenly befallen Bilbo. Frodo began to feel restless, and the old paths seemed too well-trodden. He looked at maps, and wondered what lay beyond their edges: maps made in the Shire showed mostly white spaces beyond its borders. He took to wandering further afield and more often by himself; and Merry and his other friends watched him anxiously. Often he was seen walking and talking with the strange wayfarers that began at this time to appear in the Shire.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="日子就这么继续过下去。一眨眼，他的五十岁生日就快到了。五十这个数字让他觉得十分特殊（或有些“太过”特殊了）比尔博就是在这个岁数突然间经历了许多奇遇。佛罗多开始觉得坐立难安，平日散步的小径也变得让人厌烦。他阅读地图时会思索地图的边缘之外是什么：在夏尔地区绘制的地图多半会把边境之外留白。他散步的范围越来越广，也更常单槍匹马的乱跑。梅里和其他的朋友都很担心他。他们常常看见他精力充沛的散步，或是和此时开始出现在夏尔的陌生旅人聊天。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There were rumours of strange things happening in the world outside; and as Gandalf had not at that time appeared or sent any message for several years, Frodo gathered all the news he could. Elves, who seldom walked in the Shire, could now be seen passing westward through the woods in the evening, passing and not returning; but they were leaving Middle-earth and were no longer concerned with its troubles. There were, however, dwarves on the road in unusual numbers. The ancient East-West Road ran through the Shire to its end at the Grey Havens, and dwarves had always used it on their way to their mines in the Blue Mountains.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="据说外面的世界有了许多的变化，流言跟着四起，甘道夫那时已经有好多年没有任何消息；佛罗多只好尽可能的靠自己收集一切的情报。极少踏入夏尔的精灵现在也会于傍晚取道此地，沿着森林头也不回的往西走。他们准备离开中土世界，再也不插手凡间的争端。除此之外，路上的矮人也比往常要多。历史悠久的西东路穿越夏尔，通往灰港岸，矮人们一向利用这条路跋涉前往蓝山脉中的矿坑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They were the hobbits' chief source of news from distant parts -- if they wanted any: as a rule dwarves said little and hobbits asked no more. But now Frodo often met strange dwarves of far countries, seeking refuge in the West. They were troubled, and some spoke in whispers of the Enemy and of the Land of Mordor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们是任何有需要的哈比人对外界最可靠的情报来源。一般来说，矮人都不愿多说，而哈比人也不会追问。不过，现在，佛罗多经常会遇到从遥远异乡赶来的矮人，准备往西方避难。他们每个人都心事重重，间或有人提到魔王和魔多之境的消息。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That name the hobbits only knew in legends of the dark past, like a shadow in the background of their memories; but it was ominous and disquieting. It seemed that the evil power in Mirkwood had been driven out by the White Council only to reappear in greater strength in the old strongholds of Mordor. The Dark Tower had been rebuilt, it was said. From there the power was spreading far and wide, and away far east and south there were wars and growing fear. Orcs were multiplying again in the mountains. Trolls were abroad, no longer dull-witted, but cunning and armed with dreadful weapons. And there were murmured hints of creatures more terrible than all these, but they had no name.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些名字都只出现在过去的黑暗历史中，对哈比人来说就像是记忆中久未得见的一样：但这样不祥的消息的确让人感到不安。看来被圣白议会从幽暗密林中所驱逐的敌人现在又以更强大的形体重生在魔多的要塞中。根据流言，邪黑塔已经被重建。以邪黑塔为中心，邪恶的势力如燎原野火般向外扩展，极东和极南边的战火及恐惧都在不停的蔓延。半兽人又再度肆虐于群山间。食人妖的踪迹再现，这次他们不再是传说中那种愚蠢的食肉兽，反而摇身一变成为诡诈的武装战士。还有更多恐怖的耳语述说着比这些都更恐怖的生物，但它们都没有名字。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Little of all this, of course, reached the ears of ordinary hobbits. But even the deafest and most stay-at-home began to hear queer tales; and those whose business took them to the borders saw strange things. The conversation in The Green Dragon at Bywater, one evening in the spring of Frodo's fiftieth year, showed that even in the comfortable heart of the Shire rumours had been heard, though most hobbits still laughed at them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，一般正常过活的哈比人根本不可能知道这些谣言。但即使是最深居简出的哈比人也开始听到奇怪的故事，因工作所需而必须前往边境的哈比人更看到许多诡异的迹象。在佛罗多五十岁那年春天的一个傍晚，临水区的“绿龙旅店”里面的对话让人明白，即使是夏尔这与世隔绝的地区也开始流传这些四起的流言；不过大多数的哈比人依旧嗤之以鼻。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"And I've heard tell that Elves are moving west. They do say they are going to the harbours, out away beyond the White Towers." Sam waved his arm vaguely: neither he nor any of them knew how far it was to the Sea, past the old towers beyond the western borders of the Shire. But it was an old tradition that away over there stood the Grey Havens, from which at times elven-ships set sail, never to return.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我还听说精灵们开始往西方迁徙。他们说他们准备要去港口，暂时还不准备到白塔之外去。”山姆含糊的挥舞着手臂，他和其他人都不知道离开夏尔西方边境和旧塔之后还离海有多远。他们只知道在那边有个叫做灰港岸的地方，精灵的船只从那边出港之后就再也不会回来了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, that isn't anything new, if you believe the old tales. And I don't see what it matters to me or you. Let them sail! But I warrant you haven't seen them doing it; nor any one else in the Shire."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“如果你相信古代的传说，这又不是什么新鲜事。我也看不出来这和你我有什么关系。就让他们开船走啊！我保证你和夏尔的其他人都不会看见这情形的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well I don't know," said Sam thoughtfully. He believed he had once seen an Elf in the woods, and still hoped to see more one day. Of all the legends that he had heard in his early years such fragments of tales and half-remembered stories about the Elves as the hobbits knew, had always moved him most deeply. "There are some, even in these parts, as know the Fair Folk and get news of them," he said. "There's Mr. Baggins now, that I work for. He told me that they were sailing and he knows a bit about Elves. And old Mr. Bilbo knew more: many's the talk I had with him when I was a little lad."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我可没那么确定，”山姆若有所思的说。他认为自己以前曾经在森林里面看过一名精灵，很希望以后还有机会可以再看到。在他所有儿时听过的故事中（仅止于哈比人对精灵贫乏的了解），每个精灵的故事都让他大为感动。“即使在我们这边也有人认识那些高贵人种，”他说。“我的老板巴金斯就是一个例子。他告诉我他们远航的故事，他也知道不少关于精灵的事情。比尔博老先生知道的更多：我小时候听他说话的时候就听到不少。”">查看中文翻译</div>

For one thing, there was a lot to do up in the Bag End garden, and he would have a busy day tomorrow, if the weather cleared. The grass was growing fast. But Sam had more on his mind than gardening. After a while he sighed, and got up and went out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆沉默的坐着，不再多言。他有很多东西要考虑。举例来说，他在袋底洞的花园里面就还有很多工作，如果明天天气好一点，他可能要忙上一整天。草皮最近长得很快。不过，山姆烦心的不只是种花割草这类的事情。他又继续沉思了片刻，最后还是叹口气，悄悄的走出门外。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"In Eregion long ago many Elven-rings were made, magic rings as you call them, and they were, of course, of various kinds: some more potent and some less. The lesser rings were only essays in the craft before it was full-grown, and to the Elven-smiths they were but trifles -- yet still to my mind dangerous for mortals. But the Great Rings, the Rings of Power, they were perilous.</div>

Yes, sooner or later -- later, if he is strong or well-meaning to begin with, but neither strength nor good purpose will last -- sooner or later the dark power will devour him."</div>

He said that it was "growing on his mind", and he was always worrying about it; but he did not suspect that the ring itself was to blame.

<div class="line_en">"When did I first begin to guess?" he mused, searching back in memory. "Let me see -- it was in the year that the White Council drove the dark power from Mirkwood, just before the Battle of Five Armies, that Bilbo found his ring. A shadow fell on my heart then, though I did not know yet what I feared. I wondered often how Gollum came by a Great Ring, as plainly it was -- that at least was clear from the first. Then I heard Bilbo's strange story of how he had "won" it, and I could not believe it. When I at last got the truth out of him, I saw at once that he had been trying to put his claim to the ring beyond doubt. Much like Gollum with his "birthday present". The lies were too much alike for my comfort. Clearly the ring had an unwholesome power that set to work on its keeper at once. That was the first real warning I had that all was not well. I told Bilbo often that such rings were better left unused; but he resented it, and soon got angry. There was little else that I could do. I could not take it from him without doing greater harm; and I had no right to do so anyway. I could only watch and wait. I might perhaps have consulted Saruman the White, but something always held me back."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我是什么时候开始怀疑的呢？”他沉吟着，搜寻着脑中的回忆。“让我想想，是在圣白议会驱逐幽暗密林中邪恶势力的那一年，就正好在五军之战（译注一），比尔博找到这枚戒指之前。我那时就觉得有些不安，却浑然不知自己在畏惧些什么。我经常想到咕鲁怎么可能会这么简单就拥有统御魔戒，至少一开始的时候看起来很简单。然后我又听说了比尔博说他是怎么‘赢得’这戒指的诡异故事，打从一开始我就不相信这个说法。在我终于从他口中逼问出实情后，我立刻明白他想要将这魔戒据为己有。就像咕鲁声称这是他的‘生日礼物’一样。这两个谎言的近似让我的不安日益加深。很明显的，这魔戒拥有某种可以影响它持有者的力量。我警告比尔博最好不要使用这种戒指，但他置之不理，甚至很快就被激怒了。我对此也束手无策。我不可能强行将魔戒从他手中夺走，又让他毫发无伤，而且我也没有立场这样做。我只能够袖手旁观，等待时机的到来。我本来应该去请益白袍萨鲁曼，但我的第六感让我迟疑了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

His knowledge is deep, but his pride has grown with it, and he takes ill any meddling. The lore of the Elven-rings, great and small, is his province. He has long studied it, seeking the lost secrets of their making; but when the Rings were debated in the Council, all that he would reveal to us of his ring-lore told against my fears. So my doubt slept -- but uneasily. Still I watched and I waited.</div>

Among the Wise I am the only one that goes in for hobbit-lore: an obscure branch of knowledge, but full of surprises. Soft as butter they can be, and yet sometimes as tough as old tree-roots.

<div class="line_en">"Of course, he possessed the ring for many years, and used it, so it might take a long while for the influence to wear off -- before it was safe for him to see it again, for instance.

I guess they were of hobbit-kind; akin to the fathers of the fathers of the Stoors, for they loved the River, and often swam in it, or made little boats of reeds. There was among them a family of high repute, for it was large and wealthier than most, and it was ruled by a grandmother of the folk, stern and wise in old lore, such as they had. The most inquisitive and curious-minded of that family was called Smeagol. He was interested in roots and beginnings; he dived into deep pools; he burrowed under trees and growing plants; he tunnelled into green mounds; and he ceased to look up at the hill-tops, or the leaves on trees, or the flowers opening in the air: his head and his eyes were downward.</div>

He became sharp-eyed and keen-eared for all that was hurtful. The ring had given him power according to his stature. It is not to be wondered at that he became very unpopular and was shunned (when visible) by all his relations. They kicked him, and he bit their feet.

<div class="line_en">"There was more than one power at work, Frodo. The Ring was trying to get back to its master. It had slipped from Isildur's hand and betrayed him; then when a chance came it caught poor Deagol, and he was murdered; and after that Gollum, and it had devoured him. It could make no further use of him: he was too small and mean; and as long as it stayed with him he would never leave his deep pool again. So now, when its master was awake once more and sending out his dark thought from Mirkwood, it abandoned Gollum. Only to be picked up by the most unlikely person imaginable: Bilbo from the Shire!</div>

<div class="line_en">"Not so clearly. What I have told you is what Gollum was willing to tell -- though not, of course, in the way I have reported it. Gollum is a liar, and you have to sift his words. For instance, he called the Ring his "birthday present", and he stuck to that. He said it came from his grandmother, who had lots of beautiful things of that kind. A ridiculous story. I have no doubt that Smeagol's grandmother was a matriarch, a great person in her way, but to talk of her possessing many Elven-rings was absurd, and as for giving them away, it was a lie.

I put the fear of fire on him, and wrung the true story out of him, bit by bit, together with much snivelling and snarling. He thought he was misunderstood and ill-used. But when he had at last told me his history, as far as the end of the Riddle-game and Bilbo's escape, he would not say any more, except in dark hints. Some other fear was on him greater than mine. He muttered that he was going to gel his own back. People would see if he would stand being kicked, and driven into a hole and then robbed. Gollum had good friends now, good friends and very strong. They would help him. Baggins would pay for it. That was his chief thought. He hated Bilbo and cursed his name. What is more, he knew where he came from."</div>

Well, the news of the great events went far and wide in Wilderland, and many had heard Bilbo's name and knew where he came from. We had made no secret of our return journey to his home in the West.

For even the very wise cannot see all ends. I have not much hope that Gollum can be cured before he dies, but there is a chance of it. And he is bound up with the fate of the Ring. My heart tells me that he has some part to play yet, for good or ill, before the end; and when that comes, the pity of Bilbo may rule the fate of many -- yours not least. In any case we did not kill him: he is very old and very wretched. The Wood-elves have him in prison, but they treat him with such kindness as they can find in their wise hearts."</div>

When he took it out he had intended to fling it from him into the very hottest part of the fire. But he found now that he could not do so, not without a great struggle.

It has been said that dragon-fire could melt and consume the Rings of Power, but there is not now any dragon left on earth in which the old fire is hot enough; nor was there ever any dragon, not even Ancalagon the Black, who could have harmed the One Ring, the Ruling Ring, for that was made by Sauron himself.

But Bilbo made no mistake in choosing his heir, though he little thought how important it would prove. I am afraid you are right. The Ring will not be able to stay hidden in the Shire much longer; and for your own sake, as well as for others, you will have to go, and leave the name of Baggins behind you.
