<div class="line_cn" title="“我还是过去看看为好。”我说，“我知道他不想让人再去打扰，但这出恶作剧太古怪，搅得我坐立不安。只有确定他没事我才能安心。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Where is Mr Ackroyd?" I asked suddenly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“艾克罗伊德先生呢？”我突然问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I passed through the door on the right, Parker on my heels, traversed the little lobby where a small flight of stairs led upstairs to Ackroyd's bedroom, and tapped on the study door.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Key is in the lock all right, sir," he said, rising. "On the inside. Mr Ackroyd must have locked himself in and possibly just dropped off to sleep."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“钥匙好好地插在锁孔里，先生，”他站起身来，“是从里面锁上的。艾克罗伊德先生肯定是把自己锁在屋里睡着了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我不想惊动家里的人。”我有些犹豫。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="没有回应。我转动门把手，但门已锁上了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="可屋里依然毫无动静。我回头看了看。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It seems all right," I said, "but, all the same, Parker, I'm going to wake your master up. I shouldn't be satisfied to go home without hearing from his own lips that he's quite all right."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“看来没什么不对劲。”我松了口气，“不过话说回来，帕克，还是得把你主人叫醒。除非他亲口证实自己平安，否则我还是不能放心回去。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“让我来，先生。”帕克说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And still -- silence. Not a sign of life from within the locked room. Parker and I glanced at each other.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但屋里依然死一般寂静。紧锁的房门后完全不像有活人在内。帕克和我对视一眼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I nodded comprehendingly. Then I banged once more frantically on the door, and stooping down, fairly bawled through the keyhole: "Ackroyd, Ackroyd! It's Sheppard. Let me in."</div>

<div class="line_en">I looked round the small lobby and picked up a heavy oak chair. Parker and I held it between us and advanced to the assault. Once, twice, and three times we hurled it against the lock. At the third blow it gave, and we staggered into the room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我环视逼仄的门廊，搬起一把沉重的橡木椅子。帕克和我一左一右端起椅子对准门锁撞去。一次，两次，第三次终于撞开了，我们俩踉跄着冲进房内。">查看中文翻译</div>
