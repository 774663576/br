<div class="line_en">That evening, when Frith brought in the local paper, there were great headlines right across the top of the page. He brought the paper and laid it down on the table. Maxim was not there; he had gone up early to change for dinner.

<div class="line_en">Frith went out of the room after that, and I glanced quickly at the paper before Maxim came down. There was a great column, all down the front page, and an awful blurred photograph of Maxim that must have been taken at least fifteen years ago. It was dreadful, seeing it there on the front page staring at me. And the little line about myself at the bottom, saying whom Maxim had married as his second wife, and how we had just given the fancy dress ball at Manderley. It sounded so crude and callous, in the dark print of the newspaper. Rebecca, whom they described as beautiful, talented, and loved by all who knew her, having been drowned a year ago, and then Maxim marrying again the following spring, bringing his bride straight to Manderley (so it said) and giving the big fancy dress ball in her honour. And then the following morning the body of his first wife being found, trapped in the cabin of her sailing boat, at the bottom of the bay.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弗里思说完走出房间去。我乘迈克西姆还没下楼，飞快朝报纸扫了一眼。头版上有通版一大栏文字，还登了迈克西姆的一张照片。那张照片很难看，又模糊不清，大概至少是十五年前拍的。看见这样一张照片赫然登在头版，真叫人难受。版面的底部还有短短一行文字写到我本人，说我是迈克西姆的第二个妻子，接着又提到出事前不久他刚在曼陀丽举行了化装舞会。这些事经报纸的黑体铅字一张扬，听上去多少不近人情，又多么残酷。报上说吕蓓卡才貌双全，认识她的人无不喜欢她，可是在一年前淹死了。不料，迈克西姆到了第二年春天马上续弦，而且直接把新娘子带回曼陀丽来（报上就是这么说的），还为她举行了大型化装舞会。翌日早晨，他前妻的尸体被发现，就在她那艘帆船的船舱里，帆船沉没在海湾的海底。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was true of course, though sprinkled with the little inaccuracies that added to the story, making it strong meat for the hundreds of readers who wanted value for their pennies. Maxim sounded vile in it, a sort of satyr. Bringing back his "young bride", as it described me, to Manderley, and giving the dance, as though we wanted to display ourselves before the world.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="整个报道当然全是事实，某几处稍有失真，那也是为了给数以百计的读者一些刺激，这些读者花了钱订阅报纸，都想读到有价值的内容。报道把迈克西姆写得心术不正，简直是耽于淫乐的搞女人的老手：带着“年轻的新娘”——报道的原话——回了曼陀丽，举行舞会，听上去好像我们想在世人面前炫耀自己。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I hid the paper under the cushion of the chair so that Maxim should not see it. But I could not keep the morning editions from him. The story was in our London papers too. There was a picture of Manderley, and the story underneath. Manderley was news, and so was Maxim. They talked about him as Max de Winter. It sounded racy, horrible. Each paper made great play of the fact that Rebecca's body had been found the day after the fancy dress ball, as though there was something deliberate about it. Both papers used the same word, "ironic". Yes, I suppose it was ironic. It made a good story. I watched Maxim at the breakfast table getting whiter and whiter as he read the papers, one after the other, and then the local one as well. He did not say anything. He just looked across at me, and I stretched out my hand to him. "Damn them," he whispered, "damn them, damn them."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我把报纸塞在一只椅垫底下，免得迈克西姆看到。可是我没法把晨报也藏起来。我们订阅的伦敦报纸也登载了这事，上方是一张曼陀丽的照片，底下是文字报道。曼陀丽成了新闻；迈克西姆也不例外。报上把他称为迈克斯—德温特，这名字听上去多么油滑而有失尊严。化装舞会的次日发现了吕蓓卡的尸体，各报对此都大肆渲染，就好像两者是某种人为的安排。那两份报纸都用上了“有讽刺意味”这个字眼。不错，事实确实有讽刺意味，因此报上才大登特登。早饭时，我看到迈克西姆读着一份又一份的报纸，最后连那份当地报纸也没漏过，读着读着，脸色越来越难看。我赶快把手伸过去。“见他们的鬼去，”他低声咒骂。“见他们的鬼，见他们的鬼去吧！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Frank came up after breakfast. He looked pale and tired, as though he had not slept. "I've told the exchange to put all calls for Manderley through to the office," he said to Maxim. "It doesn't matter who it is. If reporters ring up I can deal with them. And anyone else too. I don't want either of you to be worried at all. We've had several calls already from locals. I gave the same answer to each. Mr and Mrs de Winter were grateful for all sympathetic inquiries, and they hoped their friends would understand that they were not receiving calls during the next few days. Mrs Lacy rang up about eight-thirty. Wanted to come over at once."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="早饭后，弗兰克来访。他脸色苍白，一副疲惫不堪的样子，像是一夜没睡。“我对电话局说过了，请他们把所有打到曼陀雨来的电话接到我办事处去，”他对迈克西姆说。“不管电话是谁打来的。要是记者打电话来探听消息，由我出面对付好了。任何其他人也一概由我来应付。我不希望你们俩被人吵得没法安生。已经接到好几个本地人打来的电话。我一律以同样的话答复：德温特先生和德温特夫人对于诸亲好友的慰问不胜感激，并请各位能够谅解，这几天他们不能接听电话。莱西夫人在八点半钟光景打来电话，说是准备立刻来看望你们。”">查看中文翻译</div>

If they don't get a story the editor probably sacks them. If the editor does not produce a saleable edition the proprietor sacks him. And if the paper doesn't sell, the proprietor loses all his money. You won't have to see them or speak to them, Maxim. I'm going to do all that for you. All you have to concentrate on is your statement at the inquest."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我明白你的意思，”弗兰克说。“我们大家都巴不得把这些家伙的脖子扭下来，可是这些人的出发点你也得理解。这是他们的生计。当记者的，总得为自己的报纸干事。要是干不出什么名堂，编辑会砸了他们的饭碗；同样，要是编辑搞不出一张销路很广的报纸，老板就会砸他的饭碗；而如果报纸没有销路，老板就得赔钱。你不必接受采访，向记者发表谈话，迈克西姆。这事我会代你出面的。你得集中精力搞出一份证词，以备传讯时用。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I still avoided his eye, but I was more convinced than ever that he knew the truth. He had always known it. From the very first. I remembered the first time I met him, that first day of mine at Manderley, when he, and Beatrice, and Giles had all been at lunch, and Beatrice had been tactless about Maxim's health. I remembered Frank, his quiet turning of the subject, the way he had come to Maxim's aid in his quiet unobtrusive manner if there was ever any question of difficulty. That strange reluctance of his to talk about Rebecca, his stiff, funny, pompous way of making conversation whenever we had approached anything like intimacy. I understood it all. Frank knew, but Maxim did not know that he knew. And Frank did not want Maxim to know that he knew. And we all stood there, looking at one another, keeping up these little barriers between us.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我仍旧不敢看他的眼睛，不过在心里却进一步肯定，他了解事情的底细。他自始至终是知情者，打一开始就知道。我又记起第一次见到他的情景。那是我在曼陀丽度过的第一天，他同比阿特丽斯和贾尔斯这对夫妻一起来吃中饭。那次，比阿特丽斯对于迈克西姆的健康状况说了几句很不得体的蠢话。我记得弗兰克曾如何不动声色地扭转了话题，又如何在一旦出现困难时毫不引人注目地帮助迈克西姆摆脱窘境。无怪乎弗兰克会那么反常，老是不愿提起吕蓓卡，而每当我们刚要谈得投机，他总是马上变得十分拘谨刻板，以古怪的庄重神态没话找话地拉扯。这一切我现在全明白了。弗兰克知道底细，但是迈克西姆对此还蒙在鼓里，而弗兰克又并不希望迈克西姆知道他了解事情的底细，我们三人就这样站在那里，你看我，我看你，不肯撤除彼此之间微妙的屏障。">查看中文翻译</div>

We stayed in Manderley, in the gardens close to the house. We did not even walk in the woods. The weather had not broken yet. It was still hot, oppressive.

<div class="line_en">Lunch was a hurried, nervous meal. We none of us talked very much. I had that nagging pain again. I did not want anything to eat. I could not swallow. It was a relief when the farce of the meal was over, and I heard Maxim go out on to the drive and start up the car. The sound of the engine steadied me. It meant we had to go, we had to be doing something. Not just sitting at Manderley. Frank followed us in his own car. I had my hand on Maxim's knee all the way as he drove. He seemed quite calm. Not nervous in any way. It was like going with someone to a nursing home, someone who was to have an operation. And not knowing what would happen. Whether the operation would be successful. My hands were very cold. My heart was beating in a funny, jerky way. And all the time that little nagging pain beneath my heart. The inquest was to be held at Lanyon, the market town six miles the other side of Kerrith. We had to park the cars in the big cobbled square by the market-place. Doctor Phillips' car was there already, and also Colonel Julyan's. Other cars too. I saw a passer-by stare curiously at Maxim, and then nudge her companion's arm.</div>

<div class="line_en">"She was when I fitted her out in April of last year," said Tabb. "Mrs de Winter laid her up as usual at my yard in the October, and then in March I had word from her to fit her up as usual, which I did. That would be Mrs de Winter's fourth season with the boat since I did the conversion job for her."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“去年四月我装修这条船时，它完全可以出海，”泰勃说。“德温特夫人同往年一样，在十月把船送进我的船坞，三月份她通知我对那艘船作例行装修，我照办了。自从替她改装这艘船以来，那是德温特夫人第四年送船来装修。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, sir, everyone has to have their wits about them, when they go sailing boats, I won't deny it. But Mrs de Winter's boat wasn't one of those cranky little craft that you can't leave for a moment, like some of the boats you see in Kerrith. She was a stout seaworthy boat, and could stand a lot of wind. Mrs de Winter had sailed her in worse weather than she ever found that night. Why, it was only blowing in fits and starts at the time. That's what I've said all along. I couldn't understand Mrs de Winter's boat being lost on a night like that."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这个嘛，阁下，说到驾船，谁都得保持头脑冷静，这一点我不否认。不过，德温特夫人的船可不是那种人们在克里斯见到的小船，驾船人一刻也不得离开舵位，否则就要倾覆。那船很坚固，完全经得起风浪，吃风能力特别强。德温特夫人在比那天夜晚糟糕得多的天气也照样驾着船出海航行。不是吗？那天夜里只不过有阵风。我一直说，我弄不明白德温特夫人的船怎么会在这样一个夜晚失事。”">查看中文翻译</div>

You fitted the boat out at the beginning of the season, you reported her sound and seaworthy, and that's all I want to know. Unfortunately the late Mrs de Winter relaxed her watchfulness for a moment and she lost her life, the boat sinking with her aboard. Such accidents have happened before. I repeat again we are not blaming you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可是我看事情的经过可能就是这样，”验尸官说。“我不认为德温特先生或我们中间的任何人在这儿把事故归咎于你的手艺。航海季节开始时，你装修了那条船，并报告说船舶情况良好，经得起风浪。我想知道的就是这些。不幸得很，已故的德温特夫人一时疏忽，这样就发生了沉船事故，陪着丢了性命。这类事故以前有过。我再说一遍。本庭并不归咎于你。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's like this, sir. After the accident last year a lot of people in Kerrith made unpleasantness about my work. Some said I had let Mrs de Winter start the season in a leaky, rotten boat. I lost two or three orders because of it. It was very unfair, but the boat had sunk, and there was nothing I could say to clear myself. Then that steamer went ashore, as we all know, and Mrs de Winter's little boat was found, and brought to the surface. Captain Searle himself gave me permission yesterday to go and look at her, and I did. I wanted to satisfy myself that the work I had put in to her was sound, in spite of the fact that she had been waterlogged for twelve months or more."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是这么回事，阁下。去年出了事故以后，克里斯城好多人都说我手艺不行，有的还说我让德温特夫人驾着一条漏水的破船出海，真可谓开门不吉！为此，有两三位主顾退了货。这实在不公平喔！可是船沉了，我找不出任何自我辩白的理由。接着，正如各位所知，发生了轮船搁浅的事，随之德温特夫人的小船被发现，并被打捞上水面。塞尔海军上校昨天亲自下令，允许我去看一看那条船。我去了。我想亲眼看一看，以证实尽管船在水里浸泡了十二个月或更长时间，但我的装修活儿可没问题。”">查看中文翻译</div>

She had not touched the ridge at all. The ridge was a clear five feet away. She was lying on sand, and there wasn't the mark of a rock on her."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，阁下，我完全满意。就装修活计而论，这艘船毫无问题。塞尔海军上校已把它拖上驳船，泊在海口，我就在现场检查了全船的每一个角落。船沉的地点恰好是海底沙地；我问过潜水员，是他告诉我的。船根本没撞上礁岩；那礁岩离船足足有五英尺距离。船沉在沙砾上，船体没有岩石撞击的痕迹。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Oh, yes, with Mrs Danvers. The time Mrs Danvers stood with me by the window. Mrs Danvers was in this place now, listening to the Coroner. Maxim was standing up over there. The heat was coming up at me from the floor, rising in slow waves. It reached my hands, wet and slippery, it touched my neck, my chin, my face.</div>

<div class="line_en">"With those holes in her planking, sir, and the seacocks not closed, it wouldn't take long for a small boat like her to sink. Not much more than ten minutes, I should say. Those holes weren't there when the boat left my yard. I was proud of my work and so was Mrs de Winter. It's my opinion, sir, that the boat never capsized at all. She was deliberately scuttled."</div>
