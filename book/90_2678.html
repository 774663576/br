<div class="line_en">What right have I to write on Prudence, whereof I have little, and that of the negative sort? My prudence consists in avoiding and going without, not in the inventing of means and methods, not in adroit steering, not in gentle repairing. I have no skill to make money spend well, no genius in my economy, and whoever sees my garden discovers that I must have some other garden. Yet I love facts, and hate lubricity, and people without perception. Then I have the same title to write on prudence, that I have to write on poetry or holiness. We write from aspiration and antagonism, as well as from experience. We paint those qualities which we do not possess. The poet admires the man of energy and tactics; the merchant breeds his son for the church or the bar: and where a man is not vain and egotistic, you shall find what he has not by his praise. Moreover, it would be hardly honest in me not to balance these fine lyric words of Love and Friendship with words of coarser sound, and, whilst my debt to my senses is real and constant, not to own it in passing.</div>

<div class="line_en">The world of the senses is a world of shows; it does not exist for itself, but has a symbolic character; and a true prudence or law of shows recognizes the copresence of other laws, and knows that its own office is subaltern; knows that it is surface and not centre where it works. Prudence is false when detached. It is legitimate when it is the Natural History of the soul incarnate; when it unfolds the beauty of laws within the narrow scope of the senses.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="感官的世界不是为自己而存在的，仅仅是一种象征，起展览作用的。只有一种真正的谨慎或展览法则是承认自己与其他法则是共存的，明白它自己只是附带的，起辅助作用，不是事件的主导。只有当它是作为实体化的灵魂的自然史存在时，在它自己的感觉空间里去彰显法则的魅力时才是合理的存在。而被孤立的谨慎是不真实的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There are all degrees of proficiency in knowledge of the world. It is sufficient, to our present purpose, to indicate three. One class live to the utility of the symbol; esteeming health and wealth a final good. Another class live above this mark to the beauty of the symbol; as the poet, and artist, and the naturalist, and man of science. A third class live above the beauty of the symbol to the beauty of the thing signified; these are wise men. The first class have common sense; the second, taste; and the third, spiritual perception. Once in a long time, a man traverses the whole scale, and sees and enjoys the symbol solidly; then also has a clear eye for its beauty, and, lastly, whilst he pitches his tent on this sacred volcanic isle of nature, does not offer to build houses and barns thereon, reverencing the splendor of the God which he sees bursting through each chink and cranny.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对世界知识的了解分为许多等级。我们这里分为三个级别也就足够了：第一类人为了象征而活着，终生为了地位财富健康而奋斗。第二类人的目标比第一类人要远大一些，他们是为了美，这些人中包括艺术家、诗人、科学家。第三类人的理想又高于第二类人，是为了所表示事物的美而活着。第一类人是聪明人，第二类人懂得在生活中寻找乐趣，第三类人有精神上的悟性。只要人类越过了所有的等级，能够无障碍地观察那种象征，他也就能从自己的角度去看象征的美，到后来，他不会对自然进行不适当地改造，他从那些原有的景物里看到了上帝的光芒。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The world is filled with the proverbs and acts and winkings of a base prudence, which is a devotion to matter, as if we possessed no other faculties than the palate, the nose, the touch, the eye and ear; a prudence which adores the Rule of Three, which never subscribes, which never gives, which seldom lends, and asks but one question of any project, -- Will it bake bread? This is a disease like a thickening of the skin until the vital organs are destroyed. But culture, revealing the high origin of the apparent world, and aiming at the perfection of the man as the end, degrades every thing else, as health and bodily life, into means. It sees prudence not to be a several faculty, but a name for wisdom and virtue conversing with the body and its wants. Cultivated men always feel and speak so, as if a great fortune, the achievement of a civil or social measure, great personal influence, a graceful and commanding address, had their value as proofs of the energy of the spirit. If a man lose his balance, and immerse himself in any trades or pleasures for their own sake, he may be a good wheel or pin, but he is not a cultivated man.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一种劣质谨慎的各种格言、举动和眼神充斥在世界之中，这种谨慎只关注于物质需求。它不会舍与，没有慈善的举动。对任何事，它只关心一个问题——对自己是否有利。这就如同一种疾病，会让充满活力的器官衰竭而死。可是，由于文化把表面世界的源头揭露了出来，为了让人更加趋于完美，所以把别的所有健康的当肉体的生命降格为工具的存在。它把谨慎看成是肉体的需要和一种智慧与美的名望，而不是一种单独存在的能力。在那些有教养的人看来，他们的行事风格，他们那财富与地位就是精神力量的价值证明。要是一个人沉迷在自身的事业或愉悦上，失去了自己的平衡，那他就不是个富于教养的人，而只是一个“配件”罢了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Prudence does not go behind nature, and ask whence it is. It takes the laws of the world, whereby man's being is conditioned, as they are, and keeps these laws, that it may enjoy their proper good. It respects space and time, climate, want, sleep, the law of polarity, growth, and death. There revolve to give bound and period to his being, on all sides, the sun and moon, the great formalists in the sky: here lies stubborn matter, and will not swerve from its chemical routine. Here is a planted globe, pierced and belted with natural laws, and fenced and distributed externally with civil partitions and properties which impose new restraints on the young inhabitant.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="谨慎不会对自然深入考察。它按部就班地执行着自然界的各种规则，这些规则限制着人类。只要人们遵守这些法则，就能为自己带来好处。空间与时间、天气、需求、睡眠、极性法则、生老病死这些法则，谨慎都是尊敬的。就算是一个难以解离的物质也不会违背化学规律。太阳与月亮的规律周期使人类产生了自己的活动时间与范围。人类在一个可供居住的星球上受到各种自然法则的限制，在他们的部落内年轻人又因新的部族法则而被制约。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The spurious prudence, making the senses final, is the god of sots and cowards, and is the subject of all comedy. It is nature's joke, and therefore literature's. The true prudence limits this sensualism by admitting the knowledge of an internal and real world. This recognition once made, -- the order of the world and the distribution of affairs and times being studied with the co-perception of their subordinate place, will reward any degree of attention. For our existence, thus apparently attached in nature to the sun and the returning moon and the periods which they mark, -- so susceptible to climate and to country, so alive to social good and evil, so fond of splendor, and so tender to hunger and cold and debt, -- reads all its primary lessons out of these books.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因为过分强调感官的作用，虚假的谨慎就只是酒鬼和孱头的偶像，是让人发笑的调料。真正的谨慎不承认感官起决定性作用，它相信一个内在的真正世界。对于世界的规范、事务和境况，用这种“相信”作为辅佐地位的共同知性来研究，这就让各方的注意力都得到了善意的回馈。我们在自然界和社会中会学到书本里所有的教训，对日月的依赖、对善恶的感觉、对美好事物的爱恋、对困苦生活的忧虑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We eat of the bread which grows in the field. We live by the air which blows around us, and we are poisoned by the air that is too cold or too hot, too dry or too wet. Time, which shows so vacant, indivisible, and divine in its coming, is slit and peddled into trifles and tatters. A door is to be painted, a lock to be repaired. I want wood, or oil, or meal, or salt; the house smokes, or I have a headache; then the tax; and an affair to be transacted with a man without heart or brains; and the stinging recollection of an injurious or very awkward word, -- these eat up the hours. Do what we can, summer will have its flies: if we walk in the woods, we must feed mosquitos: if we go a-fishing, we must expect a wet coat. Then climate is a great impediment to idle persons: we often resolve to give up the care of the weather, but still we regard the clouds and the rain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们以土地长出的粮食为食。周围的空气有时也会伤害我们。那些来时还很神圣虚幻的时间，却一下子被撕得粉碎丢掉了，时间都被生活的细枝末节蚕食了。门需要粉刷、锁必须修理、要储存生活的必需品、要灭火、要交税、要去为鸡毛蒜皮的事烦恼。去做我们能做的事吧。在林中行走我们必然会被蚊蝇叮咬，在河边钓鱼就要有打湿衣服的觉悟。我们决心不关注天气，只有在没有行动的人眼里，气候才是限制条件，不过我们依然要留意是否下雨。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We are instructed by these petty experiences which usurp the hours and years. The hard soil and four months of snow make the inhabitant of the northern temperate zone wiser and abler than his fellow who enjoys the fixed smile of the tropics. The islander may ramble all day at will. At night, he may sleep on a mat under the moon, and wherever a wild date-tree grows, nature has, without a prayer even, spread a table for his morning meal. The northerner is perforce a householder. He must brew, bake, salt, and preserve his food, and pile wood and coal. But as it happens that not one stroke can labor lay to, without some new acquaintance with nature; and as nature is inexhaustibly significant, the inhabitants of these climates have always excelled the southerner in force. Such is the value of these matters, that a man who knows other things can never know too much of these. Let him have accurate perceptions. Let him, if he have hands, handle; if eyes, measure and discriminate; let him accept and hive every fact of chemistry, natural history, and economics; the more he has, the less is he willing to spare any one. Time is always bringing the occasions that disclose their value. Some wisdom comes out of every natural and innocent action. The domestic man, who loves no music so well as his kitchen clock, and the airs which the logs sing to him as they burn on the hearth, has solaces which others never dream of. The application of means to ends insures victory and the songs of victory, not less in a farm or a shop than in the tactics of party or of war. The good husband finds method as efficient in the packing of fire-wood in a shed, or in the harvesting of fruits in the cellar, as in Peninsular campaigns or the files of the Department of State. In the rainy day, he builds a work-bench, or gets his tool-box set in the corner of the barn-chamber, and stored with nails, gimlet, pincers, screwdriver, and chisel. Herein he tastes an old joy of youth and childhood, the cat-like love of garrets, presses, and corn-chambers, and of the conveniences of long housekeeping. His garden or his poultry-yard tells him many pleasant anecdotes. One might find argument for optimism in the abundant flow of this saccharine element of pleasure in every suburb and extremity of the good world. Let a man keep the law, -- any law, -- and his way will be strown with satisfactions. There is more difference in the quality of our pleasures than in the amount.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些吞噬掉大量时间的琐碎小事引导着我们。寒苦之地的居民在聪敏能干这点上要胜过热带地区的人们。海岛上的居民可以无所事事地到各处行走。大自然为他们做好了一切，哪里都可以安逸地休息，食物随处可见。北方的民众被寒冷困在家里。他们必须为保暖和获取食物使出浑身解数。他们的一切活动都会让他们对大自然多一点了解，所以通过与自然的频繁接触他们远远胜过了南方人。一些了解别的事情的人也不知道这种事情，可见这种事情是多么具有价值。让他的知觉变得精确吧。让他用眼睛观察，用手行动吧，让他接受更多的知识吧，当他有的越多也就越节俭。随着时间的流逝，他们也会遇到揭示价值的机会。一些自然而简单的行动也会带来某种智慧。每个人都会对自己热爱的事业情有独钟，别人是无法体会到其中的乐趣的。那些为了目的的实现而采取的手段没有高低之别，只要是为了胜利，就是小酒馆里的行为也不差于军事家的决断。管家使用的储藏生活用品的方法不会比档案室的整理工作逊色。雨天的时候，他把工具摆到谷仓的角落里或在那建个工作台。在这里他重拾了童年时的愉悦时光，体会到了对阁楼、橱柜和谷仓的喜爱，感受到了对管家工作的喜爱。在他的农场他能知道许多有趣的小事。世界的每个角落都能发现愉悦的碎片，人们能在其中找到乐观主义的论证。只要循规蹈矩就会一帆风顺。量与质的不同在我们的欢乐中更加明显。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On the other hand, nature punishes any neglect of prudence. If you think the senses final, obey their law. If you believe in the soul, do not clutch at sensual sweetness before it is ripe on the slow tree of cause and effect. It is vinegar to the eyes, to deal with men of loose and imperfect perception. Dr. Johnson is reported to have said, -- "If the child says he looked out of this window, when he looked out of that, -- whip him." Our American character is marked by a more than average delight in accurate perception, which is shown by the currency of the byword, "No mistake." But the discomfort of unpunctuality, of confusion of thought about facts, of inattention to the wants of to-morrow, is of no nation. The beautiful laws of time and space, once dislocated by our inaptitude, are holes and dens. If the hive be disturbed by rash and stupid hands, instead of honey, it will yield us bees. Our words and actions to be fair must be timely. A gay and pleasant sound is the whetting of the scythe in the mornings of June; yet what is more lonesome and sad than the sound of a whetstone or mower's rifle, when it is too late in the season to make hay? Scatter-brained and "afternoon men" spoil much more than their own affair, in spoiling the temper of those who deal with them. I have seen a criticism on some paintings, of which I am reminded when I see the shiftless and unhappy men who are not true to their senses. The last Grand Duke of Weimar, a man of superior understanding, said:-- "I have sometimes remarked in the presence of great works of art, and just now especially, in Dresden, how much a certain property contributes to the effect which gives life to the figures, and to the life an irresistible truth. This property is the hitting, in all the figures we draw, the right centre of gravity. I mean, the placing the figures firm upon their feet, making the hands grasp, and fastening the eyes on the spot where they should look. Even lifeless figures, as vessels and stools, -- let them be drawn ever so correctly, -- lose all effect so soon as they lack the resting upon their centre of gravity, and have a certain swimming and oscillating appearance. The Raphael, in the Dresden gallery, (the only greatly affecting picture which I have seen,) is the quietest and most passionless piece you can imagine; a couple of saints who worship the Virgin and Child. Nevertheless, it awakens a deeper impression than the contortions of ten crucified martyrs. For, beside all the resistless beauty of form, it possesses in the highest degree the property of the perpendicularity of all the figures." This perpendicularity we demand of all the figures in this picture of life. Let them stand on their feet, and not float and swing. Let us know where to find them. Let them discriminate between what they remember and what they dreamed, call a spade a spade, give us facts, and honor their own senses with trust.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对于忽视谨慎的做法，大自然都会给予惩戒。要是你认为感官的作用是最重要的，那你就遵循这种法则好了。要是你信仰灵魂，就不要去因果之树上摘取那未成熟的感官之果。与那些知性有缺憾的人来往，就如同把沙子揉进了眼里一样难受。“要是孩子说他看到了这个窗外的风景，而事实上他看的却是另一扇窗外的风景，这时就要鞭笞他。”书里面写着这样一句约翰生博士的话语。“不错”这句话在各地都很常见，这也从一个侧面说明美国人非常喜欢准确的感知。然而在全国并没有普遍存在那些对不准时、对于事实的紊乱思维、对明天的漠然态度所产生的不安情绪。要是我们冒失地捅坏了蜂窝，那等待我们的不是美味的蜂蜜，而将是蜜蜂们的尖刺。因此，我们不当的行为破坏了时空美好的法则，就会产生不良的后果。只有在适当的时候采取行动才是合理的。六月时未雨绸缪的磨刀声是嘹亮的军号，可是到了收割后的九月再去磨刀，那声音听起来简直就像是哀嚎了。那些懒惰者毁掉的不光是他们的工作，他们还弄糟了与其交往之人的心性。当我看见那些不遵从并且抱怨自己感官的人时，我就想到那句对某些绘画作品的批评，那个具有高深理解力的末代魏玛大公说过的话：“某些时候，我看着一些美术品，特别是刚才在德累斯顿发表的意见，作品到底在真实的画面下注入了多强的生命，这都是那些特性的作用。这种特性就是我们的作品都要突出去表达事物的特点。就是让那些人物的举动合理，一切都是适当的表达。就算那些没有生命的事物也要表达出对中心的依托，不然会显得漂浮不定。我在德累斯顿美术馆看到了一副让人思想宁静怡然的作品——拉斐尔的作品，画着一双膜拜圣母圣子的圣徒。这幅画给人的感觉比十字架上那个不实的人物要深刻得多。因为画上不仅是人物形象美，而且一切都是如此的协调一致。”我们人生所需要的也正是这种协调感。让我们不要无力地浮在混沌里，应该坚实地站在大地之上。让我们懂得去哪里寻找这种协调感，用它们将记忆中与梦想中的东西统一起来，把信赖的勋章给予自己的感官。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But what man shall dare tax another with imprudence? Who is prudent? The men we call greatest are least in this kingdom. There is a certain fatal dislocation in our relation to nature, distorting our modes of living, and making every law our enemy, which seems at last to have aroused all the wit and virtue in the world to ponder the question of Reform. We must call the highest prudence to counsel, and ask why health and beauty and genius should now be the exception, rather than the rule, of human nature? We do not know the properties of plants and animals and the laws of nature through our sympathy with the same; but this remains the dream of poets. Poetry and prudence should be coincident. Poets should be lawgivers; that is, the boldest lyric inspiration should not chide and insult, but should announce and lead, the civil code, and the day's work. But now the two things seem irreconcilably parted. We have violated law upon law, until we stand amidst ruins, and when by chance we espy a coincidence between reason and the phenomena, we are surprised. Beauty should be the dowry of every man and woman, as invariably as sensation; but it is rare. Health or sound organization should be universal. Genius should be the child of genius, and every child should be inspired; but now it is not to be predicted of any child, and nowhere is it pure. We call partial half-lights, by courtesy, genius; talent which converts itself to money; talent which glitters to-day, that it may dine and sleep well to-morrow; and society is officered by men of parts, as they are properly called, and not by divine men. These use their gifts to refine luxury, not to abolish it. Genius is always ascetic; and piety and love. Appetite shows to the finer souls as a disease, and they find beauty in rites and bounds that resist it.</div>

<div class="line_en">We have found out fine names to cover our sensuality withal, but no gifts can raise intemperance. The man of talent affects to call his transgressions of the laws of the senses trivial, and to count them nothing considered with his devotion to his art. His art never taught him lewdness, nor the love of wine, nor the wish to reap where he had not sowed. His art is less for every deduction from his holiness, and less for every defect of common sense. On him who scorned the world, as he said, the scorned world wreaks its revenge. He that despiseth small things will perish by little and little. Goethe's Tasso is very likely to be a pretty fair historical portrait, and that is true tragedy. It does not seem to me so genuine grief when some tyrannous Richard the Third oppresses and slays a score of innocent persons, as when Antonio and Tasso, both apparently right, wrong each other. One living after the maxims of this world, and consistent and true to them, the other fired with all divine sentiments, yet grasping also at the pleasures of sense, without submitting to their law. That is a grief we all feel, a knot we cannot untie. Tasso's is no infrequent case in modern biography. A man of genius, of an ardent temperament, reckless of physical laws, self-indulgent, becomes presently unfortunate, querulous, a "discomfortable cousin," a thorn to himself and to others.</div>

<div class="line_en">The scholar shames us by his bifold life. Whilst something higher than prudence is active, he is admirable; when common sense is wanted, he is an encumbrance. Yesterday, Caesar was not so great; to-day, the felon at the gallows' foot is not more miserable. Yesterday, radiant with the light of an ideal world, in which he lives, the first of men; and now oppressed by wants and by sickness, for which he must thank himself. He resembles the pitiful drivellers, whom travellers describe as frequenting the bazaars of Constantinople, who skulk about all day, yellow, emaciated, ragged, sneaking; and at evening, when the bazaars are open, slink to the opium-shop, swallow their morsel, and become tranquil and glorified seers. And who has not seen the tragedy of imprudent genius, struggling for years with paltry pecuniary difficulties, at last sinking, chilled, exhausted, and fruitless, like a giant slaughtered by pins?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们因为学者的双重生活而承担屈辱。这样的学者在某种胜过谨慎的东西活跃时令人敬佩，可是在需要常识时他就成了个负担。从前他是思想世界里的光芒，是人类里的领袖；如今他却只能自饮苦酒，贫困潦倒而终了。以前的凯撒不会如此伟大，现在刑场上的犯人也不会更加可怜。这些学者就如同旅行者口里的那些衣衫褴褛、营养不良、行为鬼祟的可怜虫，一到晚上这些人吞食了鸦片后就俨然成了一个先知的模样。那些不谨慎的天才的悲剧我们都目睹过：他们与贫困搏斗到身心俱疲也毫无建树，就如同神话中那个被小针刺死的巨人一般。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Is it not better that a man should accept the first pains and mortifications of this sort, which nature is not slack in sending him, as hints that he must expect no other good than the just fruit of his own labor and self-denial? Health, bread, climate, social position, have their importance, and he will give them their due. Let him esteem Nature a perpetual counsellor, and her perfections the exact measure of our deviations. Let him make the night night, and the day day. Let him control the habit of expense. Let him see that as much wisdom may be expended on a private economy as on an empire, and as much wisdom may be drawn from it. The laws of the world are written out for him on every piece of money in his hand. There is nothing he will not be the better for knowing, were it only the wisdom of Poor Richard; or the State-Street prudence of buying by the acre to sell by the foot; or the thrift of the agriculturist, to stick a tree between whiles, because it will grow whilst he sleeps; or the prudence which consists in husbanding little strokes of the tool, little portions of time, particles of stock, and small gains. The eye of prudence may never shut. Iron, if kept at the ironmonger's, will rust; beer, if not brewed in the right state of the atmosphere, will sour; timber of ships will rot at sea, or, if laid up high and dry, will strain, warp, and dry-rot; money, if kept by us, yields no rent, and is liable to loss; if invested, is liable to depreciation of the particular kind of stock. Strike, says the smith, the iron is white; keep the rake, says the haymaker, as nigh the scythe as you can, and the cart as nigh the rake. Our Yankee trade is reputed to be very much on the extreme of this prudence. It takes bank-notes, -- good, bad, clean, ragged, -- and saves itself by the speed with which it passes them off. Iron cannot rust, nor beer sour, nor timber rot, nor calicoes go out of fashion, nor money stocks depreciate, in the few swift moments in which the Yankee suffers any one of them to remain in his possession. In skating over thin ice, our safety is in our speed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这类最开始的痛苦与委屈我们应该接受下来，这是大自然馈赠的暗示。让我们只期待自己劳动的成果，而不去期待其他的利益，这对我们来说是最好的提醒。世界上的一切东西都有其重要的作用，对待它们，我们会采取公正的态度的。让我们用大自然的完美检查自己的缺失，一生都去接受大自然的忠告。让我们知道帝国上运用的智慧与个人用在经济上的智慧是一样多的，而且在行事时吸取的知识也是同样多的。我们手里拿的每元钱都写着世界的法则。让我们黑白分明。让我们变得合理消费。哪怕仅仅是穷理查的才智、商人的谨慎、农夫的节俭等等一些点滴小事，这对我们也是有所教益的。谨慎永远不会被蒙蔽。一切东西长久置于不恰当的地方就会失去其功用。如同五金店里存放的铁会生锈、金钱不投资就没有增值而且还得提防人偷。让我们工作时离草把更近吧，靠打草为生的人会这样说；铁越打越好，这是铁匠的经验之谈。北方的商业活动就是因为谨慎而广为人知。那些事物不会因囤积而失去价值，靠的就是北方人高效的周转。生意的盈利，靠的就是钱流通的效率。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Let him learn a prudence of a higher strain. Let him learn that every thing in nature, even motes and feathers, go by law and not by luck, and that what he sows he reaps. By diligence and self-command, let him put the bread he eats at his own disposal, that he may not stand in bitter and false relations to other men; for the best good of wealth is freedom. Let him practise the minor virtues. How much of human life is lost in waiting! let him not make his fellow-creatures wait. How many words and promises are promises of conversation! let his be words of fate. When he sees a folded and sealed scrap of paper float round the globe in a pine ship, and come safe to the eye for which it was written, amidst a swarming population, let him likewise feel the admonition to integrate his being across all these distracting forces, and keep a slender human word among the storms, distances, and accidents that drive us hither and thither, and, by persistency, make the paltry force of one man reappear to redeem its pledge, after months and years, in the most distant climates.</div>

<div class="line_en">We must not try to write the laws of any one virtue, looking at that only. Human nature loves no contradictions, but is symmetrical. The prudence which secures an outward well-being is not to be studied by one set of men, whilst heroism and holiness are studied by another, but they are reconcilable. Prudence concerns the present time, persons, property, and existing forms. But as every fact hath its roots in the soul, and, if the soul were changed, would cease to be, or would become some other thing, the proper administration of outward things will always rest on a just apprehension of their cause and origin, that is, the good man will be the wise man, and the single-hearted, the politic man. Every violation of truth is not only a sort of suicide in the liar, but is a stab at the health of human society. On the most profitable lie, the course of events presently lays a destructive tax; whilst frankness invites frankness, puts the parties on a convenient footing, and makes their business a friendship. Trust men, and they will be true to you; treat them greatly, and they will show themselves great, though they make an exception in your favor to all their rules of trade.</div>

<div class="line_en">So, in regard to disagreeable and formidable things, prudence does not consist in evasion, or in flight, but in courage. He who wishes to walk in the most peaceful parts of life with any serenity must screw himself up to resolution. Let him front the object of his worst apprehension, and his stoutness will commonly make his fear groundless. The Latin proverb says, that "in battles the eye is first overcome." Entire self-possession may make a battle very little more dangerous to life than a match at foils or at football. Examples are cited by soldiers, of men who have seen the cannon pointed, and the fire given to it, and who have stepped aside from the path of the ball. The terrors of the storm are chiefly confined to the parlour and the cabin. The drover, the sailor, buffets it all day, and his health renews itself at as vigorous a pulse under the sleet, as under the sun of June.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="谨慎不会逃避那些难办或是讨厌的事情，它会表现出勇气。只有提起精神，下定决心才能宁静地在人生的坦途上前行。在直面恐惧时，个人害怕的一面，在其坚定的态度面前，就会变得软弱无力。“你的眼睛会在战场最先败下阵来”，一句拉丁俗语如是说。要是你安然处之，没有恐惧之心，一场战争不会比踢一场足球赛更凶险。战士们这样讲叙他们的经验：“只要勇敢地看到炮火的方向，你就可以避开大炮的袭击。”那些在外面讨生活的水手，游商每天都与暴风雨搏斗，因此他们不会觉得暴风雨可怕。只有躲在屋里的人，才会认为它是可怕的。经常在暴风雨中奔波的人，在各种气候中都显得活力充沛，就算是受伤了，也比普通的人恢复得快。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the occurrence of unpleasant things among neighbours, fear comes readily to heart, and magnifies the consequence of the other party; but it is a bad counsellor. Every man is actually weak, and apparently strong. To himself, he seems weak; to others, formidable. You are afraid of Grim; but Grim also is afraid of you. You are solicitous of the good-will of the meanest person, uneasy at his ill-will. But the sturdiest offender of your peace and of the neighbourhood, if you rip up his claims, is as thin and timid as any; and the peace of society is often kept, because, as children say, one is afraid, and the other dares not. Far off, men swell, bully, and threaten; bring them hand to hand, and they are a feeble folk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="同伴遇到的悲剧会让我们感受到恐惧，远比受害者本人还要大。每个人都是外表强大，内心软弱。别人眼中的凶横，在他自己这不过是软弱的特征。你希望得到最卑鄙之人的善意，可却为他的恶意提心吊胆。你害怕的东西也害怕你。哪怕是那看上去无所顾忌的凶恶歹徒，只要你拒绝他的要求，他也会不知所措起来。那些凶横无礼的恶霸们，只要与之动手，就会发现都是些软蛋。就如同孩子的纯真话语，一个胆怯，另一个也没勇气，社会也就如此维持了安宁的状态。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It is a proverb, that 'courtesy costs nothing'; but calculation might come to value love for its profit. Love is fabled to be blind; but kindness is necessary to perception; love is not a hood, but an eye-water. If you meet a sectary, or a hostile partisan, never recognize the dividing lines; but meet on what common ground remains, -- if only that the sun shines, and the rain rains for both; the area will widen very fast, and ere you know it the boundary mountains, on which the eye had fastened, have melted into air. If they set out to contend, Saint Paul will lie, and Saint John will hate. What low, poor, paltry, hypocritical people an argument on religion will make of the pure and chosen souls! They will shuffle, and crow, crook, and hide, feign to confess here, only that they may brag and conquer there, and not a thought has enriched either party, and not an emotion of bravery, modesty, or hope. So neither should you put yourself in a false position with your contemporaries, by indulging a vein of hostility and bitterness. Though your views are in straight antagonism to theirs, assume an identity of sentiment, assume that you are saying precisely that which all think, and in the flow of wit and love roll out your paradoxes in solid column, with not the infirmity of a doubt. So at least shall you get an adequate deliverance. The natural motions of the soul are so much better than the voluntary ones, that you will never do yourself justice in dispute. The thought is not then taken hold of by the right handle, does not show itself proportioned, and in its true bearings, but bears extorted, hoarse, and half witness. But assume a consent, and it shall presently be granted, since, really, and underneath their external diversities, all men are of one heart and mind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“礼貌不需要任何成本”，俗语里有这么一句话。可是爱也会被计入利益的范畴。传言爱是难以预计的。对于仁慈来说知觉是必需的。爱是一滴眼药水，它让你在不经意间看到那慢慢消融的界限；爱不是一块头巾，它不是让你在表面与其他党派结成虚伪的同盟。宗派主义分子之间的抗争会让圣徒变得忌恨而又虚伪。灵魂在宗教辩论里会由纯洁变成卑贱、虚伪、可憎。那些灵魂的宿主会自以为是，遮遮掩掩。虚伪地忏悔，就是为了在这辩论里夸夸其谈获得优胜，在这里无论是哪一方都不会获得如勇敢、谦虚那样的优秀品质。所以你们互相不要用那敌意去抱怨同时代的人。你就算有不同的意见，却还要假装赞同他们的思想，你在说着他们爱听的话语时，不被他们发现地加入了许多违抗他们观点的悖论。这让你至少获得了一种解脱。你在争论里不能竭尽全力，这是因为灵魂的自然表现要高于蓄意的谋划。思想在那时是矫揉造作的表现，失去了原有的作用，只是个强颜欢笑的半吊子旁证。可是用虚伪的赞同就能获得它的认同，即便表象各不相同，可是心里都是同一个目标。我们可以轻而易举地数落出朋友的缺点，可以非常容易地把所有名字读得高贵，但这毋庸置疑地会使我们变得更加狂妄。每个人都幻想拥有自己的朋友，那些朋友会使他的生命看起来更加可贵。要是你无法与之和谐共处，你就会失去他们。要是只是我们的妄想在制造这种全新的关系，他们的德行就会被吓跑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Wisdom will never let us stand with any man or men on an unfriendly footing. We refuse sympathy and intimacy with people, as if we waited for some better sympathy and intimacy to come. But whence and when? To-morrow will be like to-day. Life wastes itself whilst we are preparing to live. Our friends and fellow-workers die off from us. Scarcely can we say, we see new men, new women, approaching us. We are too old to regard fashion, too old to expect patronage of any greater or more powerful. Let us suck the sweetness of those affections and consuetudes that grow near us. These old shoes are easy to the feet. Undoubtedly, we can easily pick faults in our company, can easily whisper names prouder, and that tickle the fancy more. Every man's imagination hath its friends; and life would be dearer with such companions. But, if you cannot have them on good mutual terms, you cannot have them. If not the Deity, but our ambition, hews and shapes the new relations, their virtue escapes, as strawberries lose their flavor in garden-beds.</div>
