<div class="line_en">Would that I could enrich this sketch with the names of all those who have ministered to my happiness! Some of them would be found written in our literature and dear to the hearts of many, while others would be wholly unknown to most of my readers. But their influence, though it escapes fame, shall live immortal in the lives that have been sweetened and ennobled by it. Those are red-letter days in our lives when we meet people who thrill us like a fine poem, people whose handshake is brimful of unspoken sympathy, and whose sweet, rich natures impart to our eager, impatient spirits a wonderful restfulness which, in its essence, is divine. The perplexities, irritations and worries that have absorbed us pass like unpleasant dreams, and we wake to see with new eyes and hear with new ears the beauty and harmony of God's real world. The solemn nothings that fill our everyday life blossom suddenly into bright possibilities. In a word, while such friends are near us we feel that all is well. Perhaps we never saw them before, and they may never cross our life's path again; but the influence of their calm, mellow natures is a libation poured upon our discontent, and we feel its healing touch, as the ocean feels the mountain stream freshening its brine.</div>

<div class="line_en">I have often been asked, "Do not people bore you?" I do not understand quite what that means. I suppose the calls of the stupid and curious, especially of newspaper reporters, are always inopportune. I also dislike people who try to talk down to my understanding. They are like people who when walking with you try to shorten their steps to suit yours; the hypocrisy in both cases is equally exasperating.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我经常被人问及这样的问题：“难道人们不会令你心烦吗？”我实在不明白这是什么意思。我猜想这种愚蠢而怪异的声音可能来自新闻记者的报道。当然，这类报道往往是不合时宜的。我也不喜欢那些对我的理解力品头论足的人，他们在和你一起走路时，总是试图缩短他们自己的步幅，只为了迎合你行走的速度。事实上，这两类虚伪的人同样令人无法容忍。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The hands of those I meet are dumbly eloquent to me. The touch of some hands is an impertinence. I have met people so empty of joy, that when I clasped their frosty finger tips, it seemed as if I were shaking hands with a northeast storm. Others there are whose hands have sunbeams in them, so that their grasp warms my heart. It may be only the clinging touch of a child's hand; but there is as much potential sunshine in it for me as there is in a loving glance for others. A hearty handshake or a friendly letter gives me genuine pleasure.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我所接触的那一双双手虽然默默无语，但是它们却对我有着非比寻常的意义。其中，有一些手的触摸是傲慢而无礼的。我曾遇到过一些相当缺少快乐的人，当我紧紧握住他们那冷若冰霜的指尖时，我的感觉就好像正在同一场来自东北的暴风雪握手。而另外有一些人，他们的双手似乎存有阳光的余温，所以，同他们握手可以温暖我的心。也许只有小孩子的手才会抓住你不放，因为他们对你有一种强烈的信任感；我可以感觉到，他们（小孩子）的手中为我储藏了大量的阳光，正如他们为别人预备了充满爱意的眼神一样。总之，一次热情的握手，或者一封表达友情的书信，都会带给我最真切的快乐。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I count it one of the sweetest privileges of my life to have known and conversed with many men of genius. Only those who knew Bishop Brooks can appreciate the joy his friendship was to those who possessed it. As a child I loved to sit on his knee and clasp his great hand with one of mine, while Miss Sullivan spelled into the other his beautiful words about God and the spiritual world. I heard him with a child's wonder and delight. My spirit could not reach up to his, but he gave me a real sense of joy in life, and I never left him without carrying away a fine thought that grew in beauty and depth of meaning as I grew. Once, when I was puzzled to know why there were so many religions, he said: "There is one universal religion, Helen -- the religion of love. Love your Heavenly Father with your whole heart and soul, love every child of God as much as ever you can, and remember that the possibilities of good are greater than the possibilities of evil; and you have the key to Heaven." And his life was a happy illustration of this great truth. In his noble soul love and widest knowledge were blended with faith that had become insight. He saw</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="布鲁克斯主教传授给我的并非特殊的信条或教义，但是他把两种伟大的观念赐给了我——神的父亲般的慈爱，以及人的兄弟般的情谊。我以为，这些真理正是构成一切信条和崇拜形式的基础。神是爱，神是我们的父，我们是他的孩子。有了这样的信念，即使是最黑暗的云也会被吹散，而且，这里也不会有罪恶与不义的容身之地。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Since Bishop Brooks died I have read the Bible through; also some philosophical works on religion, among them Swedenborg's "Heaven and Hell" and Drummond's "Ascent of Man," and I have found no creed or system more soul-satisfying than Bishop Brooks's creed of love. I knew Mr. Henry Drummond, and the memory of his strong, warm hand-clasp is like a benediction. He was the most sympathetic of companions. He knew so much and was so genial that it was impossible to feel dull in his presence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="自从布鲁克斯主教去世后，我通读了整部《圣经》，还有其他的一些宗教哲学著作。这其中就包括斯韦登伯格的《天堂与地狱》和遮蒙德的《人类的阶梯》，可是我发现，同布鲁克斯主教“爱的信念”相比，这些人所持的信条或教理都无法令人获得心灵上的满足。我认识亨利·遮蒙德先生，印象中，他那双有力、温暖的手如同一句热情的祝福语。他是最富有同情心的良友，他是如此地和蔼可亲，只要有他在身边，你就不会感到枯燥乏味。">查看中文翻译</div>

After that I saw Dr. Holmes many times and learned to love the man as well as the poet.</div>

<div class="line_en">One beautiful summer day, not long after my meeting with Dr. Holmes, Miss Sullivan and I visited Whittier in his quiet home on the Merrimac. His gentle courtesy and quaint speech won my heart. He had a book of his poems in raised print from which I read "In School Days." He was delighted that I could pronounce the words so well, and said that he had no difficulty in understanding me. Then I asked many questions about the poem, and read his answers by placing my fingers on his lips. He said he was the little boy in the poem, and that the girl's name was Sally, and more which I have forgotten. I also recited "Laus Deo," and as I spoke the concluding verses, he placed in my hands a statue of a slave from whose crouching figure the fetters were falling, even as they fell from Peter's limbs when the angel led him forth out of prison. Afterward we went into his study, and he wrote his autograph for my teacher and expressed his admiration of her work, saying to me, "She is thy spiritual liberator." Then he led me to the gate and kissed me tenderly on my forehead. I promised to visit him again the following summer; but he died before the promise was fulfilled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在会见霍尔姆斯博士不久之后的一个阳光明媚的夏日，我和苏立文小姐在“梅里麦克”号上拜访了惠蒂尔先生。他温文尔雅的举止和不俗的谈吐赢得了我的好感。他曾出版过一本凸版印刷的诗集，我选读了其中的一首《校园时光》。他惊讶于我的读音是如此地准确，还说理解起来毫无困难。随后我又问了他很多关于诗歌的问题。我把手指放在他的嘴唇上，这样就可以“读出”他的回答。他说他自己就是诗中的那个小男孩，而那个女孩的名字叫萨莉，他当然不只说了这些，但是我大都不记得了。我还为他背诵了《洛斯迪奥》，当我吟诵到最后的诗句时，他把一个奴隶的雕像放在了我的手中，奴隶身体蜷曲，脚踝拴着脚镣，就像刚被天使从监狱中解救出来的样子——奴隶一下子瘫倒在彼得的翅膀之下。后来，我们走进了他的书房，他不但为我的老师亲笔签名，还向她表达了钦佩之意。他对我说：“她是你灵魂的拯救者。”最后，他领我来到门口，并且轻柔地吻了吻我的额头。我答应他来年夏天还去拜访他，可是不等我履行诺言，他便去世了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I have already written of my first meeting with Dr. Alexander Graham Bell. Since then I have spent many happy days with him at Washington and at his beautiful home in the heart of Cape Breton Island, near Baddeck, the village made famous by Charles Dudley Warner's book. Here in Dr. Bell's laboratory, or in the fields on the shore of the great Bras d'Or, I have spent many delightful hours listening to what he had to tell me about his experiments, and helping him fly kites by means of which he expects to discover the laws that shall govern the future air-ship. Dr. Bell is proficient in many fields of science, and has the art of making every subject he touches interesting, even the most abstruse theories. He makes you feel that if you only had a little more time, you, too, might be an inventor. He has a humorous and poetic side, too. His dominating passion is his love for children. He is never quite so happy as when he has a little deaf child in his arms. His labours in behalf of the deaf will live on and bless generations of children yet to come; and we love him alike for what he himself has achieved and for what he has evoked from others.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我已经描述过我同亚历山大·格雷厄姆·贝尔博士初次会面时的情景。自那以后，我又在他华盛顿的家中度过了很多个愉快的日子。他美丽的家坐落在布赖顿岛海角的腹地，毗邻巴代克，这个小村因被查尔斯·达德利·沃纳写进书里而闻名。无论在贝尔博士的实验室，还是在辽阔的巴拉斯德奥尔海岸，我兴味盎然地听他讲述自己的试验，有时一听就是好几个小时。我还帮他放风筝——博士期望借此发现控制未来飞行器飞行的规律。贝尔博士不但精通各类学科，而且具有把那些知识化腐朽为神奇的本事，即便是最深奥的理论，他也能够轻松限免。同他在一起，你不禁会产生出这样的感觉，假如你只有有限的一点时间，那么，你也有可能成为一个发明家。当然，他的身上也具有幽默和诗情画意的一面。不妨说，他对孩子们的那份爱是发自肺腑的。当他把一个失聪的小孩抱在怀里时，他简直高兴得无以复加。他为了聋哑人的利益而付出的劳动，将保佑一代又一代儿童健康成长。我们爱他，不只是因为他所取得的伟大成就，还因为他唤醒了他人心中的希望。">查看中文翻译</div>

His wise, tender sympathy has been the support of Miss Sullivan and me in times of trial and sorrow, and his strong hand has helped us over many rough places; and what he has done for us he has done for thousands of those who have difficult tasks to accomplish. He has filled the old skins of dogma with the new wine of love, and shown men what it is to believe, live and be free. What he has taught we have seen beautifully expressed in his own life -- love of country, kindness to the least of his brethren, and a sincere desire to live upward and onward. He has been a prophet and an inspirer of men, and a mighty doer of the Word, the friend of all his race -- God bless him!</div>

<div class="line_en">During the two years I spent in New York I had many opportunities to talk with distinguished people whose names I had often heard, but whom I had never expected to meet. Most of them I met first in the house of my good friend, Mr. Laurence Hutton. It was a great privilege to visit him and dear Mrs. Hutton in their lovely home, and see their library and read the beautiful sentiments and bright thoughts gifted friends had written for them. It has been truly said that Mr. Hutton has the faculty of bringing out in every one the best thoughts and kindest sentiments.

<div class="line_en">Mr. Hutton introduced me to many of his literary friends, greatest of whom are Mr. William Dean Howells and Mark Twain. I also met Mr. Richard Watson Gilder and Mr. Edmund Clarence Stedman. I also knew Mr. Charles Dudley Warner, the most delightful of story-tellers and the most beloved friend, whose sympathy was so broad that it may be truly said of him, he loved all living things and his neighbour as himself. Once Mr. Warner brought to see me the dear poet of the woodlands -- Mr. John Burroughs. They were all gentle and sympathetic and I felt the charm of their manner as much as I had felt the brilliancy of their essays and poems. I could not keep pace with all these literary folk as they glanced from subject to subject and entered into deep dispute, or made conversation sparkle with epigrams and happy witticisms. I was like little Ascanius, who followed with unequal steps the heroic strides of Aeneas on his march toward mighty destinies. But they spoke many gracious words to me. Mr. Gilder told me about his moonlight journeys across the vast desert to the Pyramids, and in a letter he wrote me he made his mark under his signature deep in the paper so that I could feel it. This reminds me that Dr. Hale used to give a personal touch to his letters to me by pricking his signature in braille. I read from Mark Twain's lips one or two of his good stories. He has his own way of thinking, saying and doing everything. I feel the twinkle of his eye in his handshake. Even while he utters his cynical wisdom in an indescribably droll voice, he makes you feel that his heart is a tender Iliad of human sympathy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="休顿先生还把他很多文学界的朋友介绍给我，包括大名鼎鼎的威廉·迪安·豪厄尔斯和马克·吐温。我见到了理查德·沃特森·吉尔德先生和埃德蒙德·克拉伦斯·斯泰德曼先生，还结识了查尔斯·达德利·沃纳先生。他是最讨人喜欢的“说书人”，也是我最钟爱的友人；他有着无比深切的同情心，爱人如己。记得有一次，沃纳先生带我拜会了可敬的“林地诗人”——约翰·巴勒斯先生。在我看来，他们都是些心地善良而富于同情心的人，他们的人格魅力正如他们笔下的散文和诗歌一样散发着璀璨的光芒。当然，我是无法同这些文学大家盘经论道的，尤其是当他们在不同话题之间纵横捭阖，或者辩论正酣、妙语连珠的时候。我就像小阿斯卡涅斯一样，他步履蹒跚地跟在英雄父亲埃涅阿斯身后，无怨无悔地迎接命运的安排。他们热情地同我谈天说地，吉尔德先生向我讲述了他月夜旅行的经历，他曾穿越浩瀚的大沙漠前往金字塔。在给我写的信中，他特意在落款后面留下一个深深的标记，这样我就可以在纸上摸到它了。而黑尔博士自有他私人的问候方式，他会把落款签名用盲文刺在纸上。我还通过触摸马克·吐温的嘴唇而“阅读”了他的一两篇小说。马克·吐温有着自己独特的思维方式，无论讲话做事都个性鲜明。在同他握手时，我能感觉到他那炯炯有神的目光。他经常会以一种难以描述的机智而诙谐的语言针砭时弊，即使在这种时候，他依然会令你感觉到他那如同伊利亚特一样的慈悲心肠。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I shall mention only two other friends. One is Mrs. William Thaw, of Pittsburgh, whom I have often visited in her home, Lyndhurst. She is always doing something to make some one happy, and her generosity and wise counsel have never failed my teacher and me in all the years we have known her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我还应该在这里提一提我的另外两个朋友。一位是匹兹堡的威廉·肖夫人，我经常去她在林德赫斯特的家做客。她为人热情，总是做一些让人开心的事。在同她交往的这些年里，她的循循善诱和从未间断的慷慨援助令我和我的老师永生难忘。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">To the other friend I am also deeply indebted. He is well known for the powerful hand with which he guides vast enterprises, and his wonderful abilities have gained for him the respect of all. Kind to every one, he goes about doing good, silent and unseen. Again I touch upon the circle of honoured names I must not mention; but I would fain acknowledge his generosity and affectionate interest which make it possible for me to go to college.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我当然不会忘记另一位于我有恩的朋友。他以强有力的手段统领着巨大的产业帝国，他杰出的（经营）才能为他赢得了世人的赞誉。他待人友善，在不为人知的状态下默默地做着善事。作为承诺，我不能在这些令人尊敬的人士中说出他的名字；但是，我一定要感谢他慷慨无私的资助，否则，我是不可能迈入大学校门的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There are a host of other interesting people I met in New York: Mrs. Mary Mapes Dodge, the beloved editor of St. Nicholas, and Mrs. Riggs (Kate Douglas Wiggin), the sweet author of "Patsy." I received from them gifts that have the gentle concurrence of the heart, books containing their own thoughts, soul-illumined letters, and photographs that I love to have described again and again. But there is not space to mention all my friends, and indeed there are things about them hidden behind the wings of cherubim, things too sacred to set forth in cold print. It is with hesitancy that I have spoken even of Mrs. Laurence Hutton.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在纽约时，我同样遇到了许多有趣的人物：比如玛丽·曼普斯·道奇夫人，就是那位可爱的《圣·尼古拉斯》杂志社的编辑。还有里格斯夫人（即凯特·道格拉斯·维津），她是《帕特希》一书的作者。我不但感受到了她们的爱心，还收到了包含了她们个人思想的书籍、启迪心灵的书信，以及那些让我爱不释手，描述了一遍又一遍的照片。当然，在这里不可能把我所有的朋友逐一提及，但是关于他们的点点滴滴，全都无一例外地被珍藏在天使的翅膀之下，这些记忆是如此地庄严神圣，远非文字所能表达清楚。因此，我是怀着犹豫不决的心情来（向你们）介绍劳伦斯·休顿夫人的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Thus it is that my friends have made the story of my life. In a thousand ways they have turned my limitations into beautiful privileges, and enabled me to walk serene and happy in the shadow cast by my deprivation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不妨这样说，正是我的朋友们成就了我的生活和我的故事。他们想方设法地把我的缺陷转变成一种荣耀（神）的特权，使我在丧失光明的黑暗中也能平静而愉快地行走。">查看中文翻译</div>
