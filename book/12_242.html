<div class="line_en">Night closed about them. At last they halted to make their camp. They had ridden for some five hours and were far out upon the western plain, yet more than half their journey lay still before them. In a great circle, under the starry sky and the waxing moon, they now made their bivouac. They lit no fires, for they were uncertain of events; but they set a ring of mounted guards about them, and scouts rode out far ahead, passing like shadows in the folds of the land. The slow night passed without tidings or alarm. At dawn the horns sounded, and within an hour they took the road again.</div>

<div class="line_en">The sun was already westering as they rode from Edoras, and the light of it was in their eyes, turning all the rolling fields of Rohan to a golden haze. There was a beaten way, north-westward along the foot-hills of the White Mountains, and this they followed, up and down in a green country, crossing small swift streams by many fords. Far ahead and to their right the Misty Mountains loomed; ever darker and taller they grew as the miles went by. The sun went slowly down before them. Evening came behind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他们离开伊多拉斯的时候，太阳已经开始西沉，落日的光芒让眼前洛汗的大草原染上了黄金的火焰。他们沿着一条西北方靠着白色山脉的大路前进，越过许多条细小的河流。他们的右方极远处是耸立的迷雾山脉，随着他们的脚步，它变得越来越高大、越来越黑暗。太阳在他们面前缓缓沉坠，暮色也跟着降临。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The host rode on. Need drove them. Fearing to come too late, they rode with all the speed they could, pausing seldom. Swift and enduring were the steeds of Rohan, but there were many leagues to go. Forty leagues and more it was, as a bird flies, from Edoras to the fords of the Isen, where they hoped to find the king's men that held back the hosts of Saruman.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="甘道夫策马奔回勒苟拉斯和伊欧墨身边，“勒苟拉斯，你拥有精灵的敏锐视觉，”他说：“可以在数哩之内分辨麻雀和幼雏的分别。告诉我，你在往艾辛格的方向看见了任何异常吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Many miles lie between," said Legolas, gazing thither and shading his eyes with his long hand. "I can see a darkness. There are shapes moving in it, great shapes far away upon the bank of the river; but what they are I cannot tell. It is not mist or cloud that defeats my eyes: there is a veiling shadow that some power lays upon the land, and it marches slowly down stream. It is as if the twilight under endless trees were flowing downwards from the hills."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“距离那边还有很远的距离，”勒苟拉斯用手遮住日光，边观察道：“我看见一道黑影，里面有一些生物在移动；在河边有许多高大的身影在移动，但我看不出来那是什么。遮蔽我视线的并非是云雾，而是某种笼罩大地的力量，它正沿着那河流往下扩散；感觉上，好象是树林之中的阴影都从山丘上集体流泻而出。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There were no clouds overhead yet, but a heaviness was in the air; it was hot for the season of the year. The rising sun was hazy, and behind it, following it slowly up the sky, there was a growing darkness, as of a great storm moving out of the East. And away in the North-west there seemed to be another darkness brooding about the feet of the Misty Mountains, a shadow that crept down slowly from the Wizard's Vale.</div>

<div class="line_en">He came, a weary man with dinted helm and cloven shield. Slowly he climbed from his horse and stood there a while gasping. At length he spoke. "Is Éomer here?" he asked. "You come at last, but too late, and with too little strength. Things have gone evilly since Théodred fell. We were driven back yesterday over the Isen with great loss; many perished at the crossing. Then at night fresh forces came over the river against our camp. All Isengard must be emptied; and Saruman has armed the wild hillmen and herd-folk of Dunland beyond the rivers, and these also he loosed upon us. We were overmastered. The shield-wall was broken. Erkenbrand of Westfold has drawn off those men he could gather towards his fastness in Helm's Deep. The rest are scattered. Where is Éomer? Tell him there is no hope ahead. He should return to Edoras before the wolves of Isengard come there."</div>

<div class="line_en">As the second day of their riding drew on, the heaviness in the air increased. In the afternoon the dark clouds began to overtake them: a sombre canopy with great billowing edges flecked with dazzling light. The sun went down, blood-red in a smoking haze. The spears of the Riders were tipped with fire as the last shafts of light kindled the steep faces of the peaks of Thrihyrne: now very near they stood on the northernmost arm of the White Mountains, three jagged horns staring at the sunset. In the last red glow men in the vanguard saw a black speck, a horseman riding back towards them. They halted awaiting him.</div>

<div class="line_en">The host turned away now from the road to the Fords of Isen and bent their course southward. Night fell, and still they rode on. The hills drew near, but the tall peaks of Thrihyrne were already dim against the darkening sky. Still some miles away, on the far side of the Westfold Vale, a great bay in the mountains, lay a green coomb, out of which a gorge opened in the hills. Men of that land called it Helm's Deep, after a hero of old wars who had made his refuge there. Ever steeper and narrower it wound inward from the north under the shadow of the Thrihyrne, till the crowhaunted cliffs rose like mighty towers on either side, shutting out the light.</div>

<div class="line_en">At Helm's Gate, before the mouth of the Deep, there was a heel of rock thrust outward by the northern cliff. There upon its spur stood high walls of ancient stone, and within them was a lofty tower. Men said that in the far-off days of the glory of Gondor the sea-kings had built here this fastness with the hands of giants. The Hornburg it was called, for a trumpet sounded upon the tower echoed in the Deep behind, as if armies long-forgotten were issuing to war from caves beneath the hills. A wall, too, the men of old had made from the Hornburg to the southern cliff, barring the entrance to the gorge. Beneath it by a wide culvert the Deeping-stream passed out. About the feet of the Hornrock it wound, and flowed then in a gully through the midst of a wide green gore, sloping gently down from Helm's Gate to Helm's Dike. Thence it fell into the Deeping-coomb and out into the Westfold Vale. There in the Hornburg at Helm's Gate Erkenbrand, master of Westfold on the borders of the Mark, now dwelt. As the days darkened with threat of war, being wise, he had repaired the wall and made the fastness strong.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在圣盔谷的入口、圣盔之门前，北方的峭壁上有一座巨石伸出；在那底下有一道远古所建造的高墙，墙内则是一座耸立的高塔。人类有传说在刚铎全盛之时，海上之王藉由巨人之手建造了这座要塞。这里被称为号角堡，因为在塔上吹响的号角会在后方的深谷中回绕，彷佛古代的战将从深谷的洞穴中苏醒而战。古代的人类也将这道高墙，从号角堡延伸到南边的峭壁，完全阻挡住峡谷的入口。深溪从底下的渠道中流出，它在号角岩的位置转了个弯，从圣盔之门流向圣盔渠，再从那边落入深溪谷，最后流进西谷中。西谷的领主鄂肯布兰德，就驻守于位在圣盔之门的号角堡中，在这危机四伏的年代中，有远见的他修复了城墙，并且更强化了堡垒的防御能力。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The sky now was quickly clearing and the sinking moon was shining brightly. But the light brought little hope to the Riders of the Mark. The enemy before them seemed to have grown rather than diminished, and still more were pressing up from the valley through the breach. The sortie upon the Rock gained only a brief respite. The assault on the gates was redoubled. Against the Deeping Wall the hosts of Isengard roared like a sea. Orcs and hillmen swarmed about its feet from end to end. Ropes with grappling hooks were hurled over the parapet faster than men could cut them or fling them back. Hundreds of long ladders were lifted up. Many were cast down in ruin, but many more replaced them, and Orcs sprang up them like apes in the dark forests of the South. Before the wall's foot the dead and broken were piled like shingle in a storm; ever higher rose the hideous mounds, and still the enemy came on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="天空此时变得十分清朗，缓缓西沉的月亮发出耀眼的光芒，但这光芒并无法给骠骑们带来任何的希望，他们眼前的敌人似乎越来越多，而且远方的山谷中还有更多的敌军正在集结，从号角岩上的突袭只争取到极为短暂的时间；稍后，对城门的攻击变得加倍猛烈，艾辛格的部队如同怒潮一般不停地拍打深溪墙，半兽人和野人把城墙前面的空地挤得水泄不通。底下不停丢上的抓钩让守军们疲于奔命，砍断绳索的动作，几乎赶不上它们丢上来的速度。数以百计的长梯也在墙边架了起来，许多梯子被守军给砸烂，但又有更多的梯子冲了上来；半兽人飞快地在梯子上攀爬，如同南方森林中的猿猴一般矫健。墙角的尸体堆积如山，但敌人却视若无睹地蜂涌而来。">查看中文翻译</div>

Hark! They hate us, and they are glad; for our doom seems certain to them. 'The king, the king!' they cry. 'We will take their king. Death to the Forgoil! Death to the Strawheads! Death to the robbers of the North!' Such names they have for us. Not in half a thousand years have they forgotten their grievance that the lords of Gondor gave the Mark to Eorl the Young and made alliance with him. That old hatred Saruman has inflamed.

Over the wall and under the wall the last assault came sweeping like a dark wave upon a hill of sand. The defence was swept away.

<div class="line_en">"It is said that the Hornburg has never fallen to assault," said Théoden; "but now my heart is doubtful. The world changes, and all that once was strong now proves unsure. How shall any tower withstand such numbers and such reckless hate? Had I known that the strength of Isengard was grown so great, maybe I should not so rashly have ridden forth to meet it, for all the arts of Gandalf. His counsel seems not now so good as it did under the morning sun."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“据说号角堡从未被攻陷过，”希优顿说：“但我现在也不禁感到有些动摇，世事多变化，一度强胜的国家可能在转眼间崩溃，世界上怎么可能有任何建筑，能够抵御这种狂暴的攻势和无边无际的仇恨？如果我早知道艾辛格的势力已经如此坐大，或许我就不敢这么狂妄地上战场，就算有甘道夫的所有魔法在背后支持也一样。他的建议现在看起来并没有白天时那么的妥当！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Do not judge the counsel of Gandalf, until all is over, lord," said Aragorn.</div>

<div class="line_en">"The end will not be long," said the king. "But I will not end here, taken like an old badger in a trap. Snowmane and Hasufel and the horses of my guard are in the inner court. When dawn comes, I will bid men sound Helm's horn, and I will ride forth. Will you ride with me then, son of Arathorn? Maybe we shall cleave a road, or make such an end as will be worth a song -- if any be left to sing of us hereafter."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不久一切就会结束了，”国王说：“但我可不愿意像是只鼠辈一样被困在这牢笼中。雪鬃和哈苏风以及禁卫军的座骑都在内院里，只要天一亮，我就会下令部属吹起圣盔谷的迎战号角，亲自策马出阵。亚拉冈，你愿意和我一起上战场吗？或许我们可以杀出一条血路来，或至少来上一场可歌可泣的战斗──希望到时还会有人活下来，记载我们的事迹。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Taking his leave, he returned to the walls, and passed round all their circuit, enheartening the men, and lending aid wherever the assault was hot. Legolas went with him. Blasts of fire leaped up from below shaking the stones. Grappling-hooks were hurled, and ladders raised. Again and again the Orcs gained the summit of the outer wall, and again the defenders cast them down.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他向国王告退，回到城墙上，把握每一个机会激励守军，哪里战况最激烈，他就奋不顾身地前去支持，勒苟拉斯和他一同冒险犯难。城下不停爆炸的火焰一次又一次撼动城墙，敌方又丢出了许多抓勾和攻城梯；半兽人一次又一次的意图冲进城内，而守军也一次次将他们击退。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a roar and a blast of fire. The archway of the gate above which he had stood a moment before crumbled and crashed in smoke and dust. The barricade was scattered as if by a thunderbolt. Aragorn ran to the king's tower.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一声震耳欲聋的巨响和刺眼的火光爆射，亚拉冈之前所站立的地方，一瞬间在浓烟中崩塌了下来，城门底下的防御工事似乎受到闪电击打一般地崩溃了。亚拉冈狂奔向国王所在的高塔，">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So great a power and royalty was revealed in Aragorn, as he stood there alone above the ruined gates before the host of his enemies, that many of the wild men paused, and looked back over their shoulders to the valley, and some looked up doubtfully at the sky. But the Orcs laughed with loud voices; and a hail of darts and arrows whistled over the wall, as Aragorn leaped down.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="亚拉冈身上散发出举世无匹的王者之气，让地面上的野人停下动作，不安地回头看着山谷的入口，有些甚至抬头看着天空。但半兽人们则是毫不留情地哈哈大笑，亚拉冈从高墙一跃而下，身后的箭矢如雨激射。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But even as the gate fell, and the Orcs about it yelled, preparing to charge, a murmur arose behind them, like a wind in the distance, and it grew to a clamour of many voices crying strange news in the dawn. The Orcs upon the Rock, hearing the rumour of dismay, wavered and looked back. And then, sudden and terrible, from the tower above, the sound of the great horn of Helm rang out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，就在大门被攻陷、半兽人们狂吼着准备冲锋时，他们的身后忽然响起了低语的声音，仿佛是远方的和风带来了不祥的预兆。号角岩上的半兽人听见这声音，不禁转头回顾；就在那时，从要塞中的高塔响起了圣盔谷的迎战号角。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Forth Eorlingas!" With a cry and a great noise they charged. Down from the gates they roared, over the causeway they swept, and they drove through the hosts of Isengard as a wind among grass. Behind them from the Deep came the stern cries of men issuing from the caves, driving forth the enemy. Out poured all the men that were left upon the Rock. And ever the sound of blowing horns echoed in the hills.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“骠骑们，冲啊！”一声大吼，所有的马队全都朝敌人冲锋。他们冲出了倒塌的大门，一路所向披靡，像是狂风吹过草原一般席卷过艾辛格的部队。在圣盔谷中则是传来之前幸存者的回应，他们从洞穴中杀出，赶走了流连在该处的敌人。号角岩所有残存的守军全都一涌而出，震耳的号角声依旧在山丘中不停地四处回响。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">All that heard that sound trembled. Many of the Orcs cast themselves on their faces and covered their ears with their claws. Back from the Deep the echoes came, blast upon blast, as if on every cliff and hill a mighty herald stood. But on the walls men looked up, listening with wonder; for the echoes did not die. Ever the hornblasts wound on among the hills; nearer now and louder they answered one to another, blowing fierce and free.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所有听见这声音的人都不禁浑身颤抖，许多半兽人伏倒在地，用爪子捂住耳朵。从圣盔谷中传来了不断的回响，一声接一声，仿佛每座山峰上都有一名号手回应这呼唤。守军们专注地倾听着，号角声不停地在山谷中回响，不但没有减弱，更显得越来越狂野奔放、越来越高昂振奋。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On they rode, the king and his companions. Captains and champions fell or fled before them. Neither orc nor man withstood them. Their backs were to the swords and spears of the Riders, and their faces to the valley. They cried and wailed, for fear and great wonder had come upon them with the rising of the day.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="国王带领着禁卫军奋勇冲杀，敌人的统帅和军官，不是死于长枪之下就是四散奔逃，没有任何的半兽人或是人类可以阻挡他们的攻势。骠骑不停地追赶，敌人没命的奔逃，艾辛格的部队溃不成军──黎明的确给他们带来了意想不到的致命打击。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So King Théoden rode from Helm's Gate and clove his path to the great Dike. There the company halted. Light grew bright about them. Shafts of the sun flared above the eastern hills and glimmered on their spears. But they sat silent on their horses, and they gazed down upon the Deeping-coomb.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="希优顿王就这样，一路从圣盔之门冲杀到圣盔渠，部队在那边停了下来，天色越来越明亮。阳光开始从东方的山丘后一道道的跃出，反射在他们的枪尖上。但他们只能沉默不语地坐在马上，目瞪口呆望着深溪谷的景象。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The land had changed. Where before the green dale had lain, its grassy slopes lapping the ever-mounting hills, there now a forest loomed. Great trees, bare and silent, stood, rank on rank, with tangled bough and hoary head; their twisted roots were buried in the long green grass. Darkness was under them. Between the Dike and the eaves of that nameless wood only two open furlongs lay. There now cowered the proud hosts of Saruman, in terror of the king and in terror of the trees. They streamed down from Helm's Gate until all above the Dike was empty of them, but below it they were packed like swarming flies. Vainly they crawled and clambered about the walls of the coomb, seeking to escape. Upon the east too sheer and stony was the valley's side; upon the left, from the west, their final doom approached.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大地的容貌已经完全改变了，原先那里是一块倾斜的大草原，现在却出现了一座森林。这些树木沉默地矗立在草原上，纠缠的枝丫间几乎没有任何的空隙，它们扭曲的根部深深钻入土壤中，森林中则是漆黑一片。在圣盔渠和这座无名的森林之间，只有不到一哩的空隙，萨鲁曼引以为豪的大军就被困在该处，因为骠骑的威力加上恐怖的树林而无法动弹。他们没命地奔逃，却被困在深溪谷中；他们徒劳无功地攀爬着峭壁，想要逃开这困局，却只是白费力气；而他们真正的致命一击，则是从西方出现了。">查看中文翻译</div>

Behind him, hastening down the long slopes, were a thousand men on foot; their swords were in their hands. Amid them strode a man tall and strong. His shield was red.

Down through the breach of the Dike charged the king's company. Down from the hills leaped Erkenbrand, lord of Westfold. Down leaped Shadowfax, like a deer that runs surefooted in the mountains. The White Rider was upon them, and the terror of his coming filled the enemy with madness. The wild men fell on their faces before him. The Orcs reeled and screamed and cast aside both sword and spear. Like a black smoke driven by a mounting wind they fled. Wailing they passed under the waiting shadow of the trees; and from that shadow none ever came again.</div>
