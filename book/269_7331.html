<div class="line_en">I couldn't condone what Jacob and his friends, his pack, were doing. I understood now what he'd said last night -- that I might not want to see him again -- and I could have called him as he'd suggested, but that felt cowardly. I owed him a face-to-face conversation, at least. I would tell him to his face that I couldn't just overlook what was going on. I couldn't be friends with a killer and say nothing, let the killing continue… That would make me a monster, too.</div>

<div class="line_en">I twisted the knob; it was unlocked. Billy was leaning around an open doorway just off the little kitchen, a bathrobe around his shoulders, not in his chair yet. When he saw who it was, his eyes widened briefly, and then his face turned stoic.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我转动门把，门没锁。比利没有坐在轮椅上，而是倚靠在厨房的门口，肩上搭着一条浴巾，他看到进来的人是我，一下子瞪大了眼睛，但很快恢复了平常的漠然。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“轮到我打扰他休息了。”我嘟囔道，怒冲冲地朝走廊走去，比利叹了口气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jacob's tiny closet of a room was the only door in the yard-long hallway. I didn't bother to knock. I threw the door open; it slammed against the wall with a bang.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雅各布的卧室是个狭小的储藏室，是一码长的走廊上唯一的房间。我没敲门，狠狠地将门推开，房门撞到墙上发出呯的响声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jacob -- still wearing just the same black cut-off sweats he'd worn last night -- was stretched diagonally across the double bed that took up all of his room but a few inches around the edges. Even on a slant, it wasn't long enough; his feet hung off the one end and his head off the other. He was fast asleep, snoring lightly with his mouth hanging open. The sound of the door hadn't even made him twitch.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雅各布还穿着昨晚那套黑色的运动服——斜躺在双人床上。这张床占据了房间的大部分空间，床边和墙壁之间留着一点空隙。尽管他是斜躺着，但床还是不够长，他的头和脚都撑到了床外……他睡得正熟，张着嘴巴，微微地打鼾，根本没听到房门撞击墙壁的声响。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I stepped back out, and shut the door quietly behind me.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“当然，当然。”比利满口答应。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Billy nodded, and then we gazed at each other for a minute. I was dying to ask him about his part in this. What did he think of what his son had become? But I knew how he'd supported Sam from the very beginning, and so I supposed the murders must not bother him. How he justified that to himself I couldn't imagine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="比利点点头，我们注视着前方，我很想质问他在整件事中承担的责任，他对儿子的变化有什么想法呢？但是，我知道他从一开始就站在山姆那边，对于杀人犯他一定也不以为然，我无法想象他如何能够坦然面对这件事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I drove down to First Beach and parked in the empty dirt lot. It was still dark -- the gloomy predawn of a cloudy day -- and when I cut the headlights it was hard to see. I had to let my eyes adjust before I could find the path that led through the tall hedge of weeds. It was colder here, with the wind whipping off the black water, and I shoved my hands deep into the pockets of my winter jacket. At least the rain had stopped.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我把车开到第一海滩，停在空无一人的泥地上。天还是灰蒙蒙的——阴天天亮前的阴郁——我关了车灯，几乎什么也看不见。我的眼睛逐渐适应了四周的黑暗，在杂草丛生的荒地上寻找道路。海滩边很冷，海风一阵阵刮过来，我把手塞进外套口袋，所幸的是雨已经停了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Look," I said, breaking the loud silence. "I'll be down at the beach for a while. When he wakes up, tell him I'm waiting for him, okay?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Seeing Jacob like that -- innocent and vulnerable in sleep -- had stolen all my revulsion, dissolved all my anger. I still couldn't turn a blind sye to what was happening, like Billy seemed to, but I couldn't condemn Jacob for it either. Love didn't work that way, I decided. Once you cared about a person, it was impossible to be logical about them anymore. Jacob was my friend whether he killed people or not. And I didn't know what I was going to do about that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="回想起雅各布的模样——熟睡时无辜、柔弱的模样——我的憎恶和愤怒全都烟消云散了。我不能像比利一样对发生的一切视而不见，但我也不能将所有的过错都怪罪到雅各布身上。爱不是这个样子的，如果你在乎一个人，就没有办法理性地对待他的所作所为。不管雅各布有没有杀人，他始终都是我的朋友，我自己也不清楚应该如何是好。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I found what I was looking for before I realized I was looking for it. It materialized out of the gloom when it was just a few feet away: a long bone-white driftwood tree stranded deep on the rocks. The roots twisted up at the seaward end, like a hundred brittle tentacles. I couldn't be sure that it was the same tree where Jacob and I had had our first conversation -- a conversation that had begun so many different, tangled threads of my life -- but it seemed to be in about the same place I sat down where I'd sat before, and stared out across the invisible sea.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="终于到了，我没意识到自己是在寻找这个地方。在不远处的昏暗之中，它朦胧可见：一棵高大、灰白的浮木深深插入岩石地中，朝向大海的树根纠结在一起，好像无数脆弱的触角。我不确定这就是雅各布和我第一次交谈的地方——从那次谈话以后，我的生活发生了翻天覆地的变化，变得错综复杂——但是，大概就是在这附近。我在我曾经坐过的地方坐下，望着若隐若现的大海。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I paced down the beach toward the north seawall. I couldn't see St. James or the other islands, just the vague shape of the water's edge. I picked my way carefully across the rocks, watching out for driftwood that might trip me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我沿着海滩向北面的海堤走去。我望不见圣詹姆斯和其他岛屿，只能隐隐约约地看到海上的波浪。我小心翼翼地穿过岩石，生怕被浮木绊倒。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jacob's voice came from the darkness and made me jump. It was soft, almost shy, but I'd been expecting some forewarning from the noisy rocks, and so it still startled me. I could see his silhouette against the coming sunrise -- it looked enormous.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="灰暗中传来雅各布的声音，我吓了一跳。他的声音温柔，甚至带有一丝羞怯，但他靠进时没发出一点声响，着实吓坏了我。借着日出前的光亮，我看见了他的轮廓——高达壮实。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was quiet for a long moment and, though it was still too dark to see well, my skin prickled as if his eyes were searching my face. There must have been enough light for him to read my expression, because when he spoke again, his voice was suddenly acidic.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们沉默了许久，尽管四周很暗，什么也看不清楚，但我觉得他似乎在仔细观察着我的脸色。我感到浑身不自在，针刺般的难受。他一定是看清楚了我的表情，因为他再次开口说话时，声音变得尖酸。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I squeezed my midsection, trying to ignore the throbbing around the edges of my chest. "Not really, no."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我不这么认为，”我想了想，叹了口气，“如果有的话，他应该会提起。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"How do you know me so well, Jacob? Sometimes it's like you can read my mind."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你怎么这么了解我，雅各布？有时候，我觉得你似乎也能读着我的心思。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“这如何？”我问道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“他？哦，你是说爱德华——哎呀，对不起，我忘了，你不喜欢说起或者听到他的名字。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I pulled over and cut the engine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我开到路边，关掉发动机。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I inhaled slowly, and then let my breath out. "No."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我慢慢地吸了口气，然后缓缓地呼了出来。“没有。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I nodded, staring unseeingly into the gloomy forest.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你还是非常不开心，对吗？”他低声问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Please, Jacob," I interrupted, begging in a whisper. "Could we please not talk about this? I can't stand it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“求你了，雅各布，”我打断了他。轻声地请求道，“我们能不能不谈这个？我受不了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Don't feel bad. If things were different, it would be nice to finally be able to talk to someone about it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“别自责了。能够找人诉说苦恼、分担心事是再好不过的事情，只是我的情况不同。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jacob sucked in a sharp breath. "They're here. Let's go."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雅各布猛吸一口气：“他们来了，我们走吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He nodded. "Yeah, I had a hard time keeping a secret from you for two weeks. It must be hell to not be able to talk to anyone."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他点点头：“的确如此，向你保守秘密的那两个星期实在不好过。找不到任何人倾诉，就像在地狱里受煎熬一样。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Hell," I agreed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“确实是煎熬。”我赞同道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Ha ha," I said. But I got out of the truck, hurrying around the front end to stand close beside Jacob. I remembered only too clearly the giant monsters in the meadow. My hands were trembling like Jacob's had been before, but with fear rather than rage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哈哈。”我笑了笑。我从车里下来，快速地绕过车头，紧挨在雅各布身边站着。在草地上见到的巨型怪兽的样子至今历历在目。我的双手同之前雅各布的手一样颤抖不停，不同的是，我是因为恐惧而不是愤怒。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Are you sure?" I asked while he popped his door open. "Maybe I shouldn't be here."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你确定吗？”他推开车门时我问道，“也许我不应该来这里。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"They'll deal with it," he said, and then he grinned. "Who's afraid of the big, bad wolf?"</div>
