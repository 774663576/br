<div class="line_en">Control is not necessarily a dirty word. If a mother restrains her toddler instead of letting him wander into the street, we don't call her a controller, we call her prudent. She is exercising control that is in tune with reality, motivated by her child's need for protection and guidance.</div>

<div class="line_en">Let's listen in on an imaginary conversation between an adult child and one of his controlling parents. I can guarantee you this conversation would never take place, but if these two people were capable of honestly expressing their deeply hidden feelings, they might say the following.</div>

<div class="line_en">CONTROLLING MOTHER: I can't describe the pain I feel when you pull away from me. I need you to need me. I can't stand the thought of losing you. You're my whole life. I'm terrified that you're going to make some horrible mistakes. It would rip me apart to see you get hurt. I'd rather die than feel like a failure as a mother.</div>

<div class="line_en">The fear of not being needed motivates many controlling parents to perpetuate this sense of powerlessness in their children. These parents have an unhealthy fear of the "empty nest syndrome," the inevitable sense of loss that all parents experience when their children finally leave home. So much of a controlling parent's identity is tied up in the parental role that he or she feels betrayed and abandoned when the child becomes independent.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Appropriate control becomes overcontrol when the mother restrains her child ten years later, long after the child is perfectly able to cross the street alone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Children who are not encouraged to do, to try, to explore, to master, and to risk failure, often feel helpless and inadequate. Over-controlled by anxious, fearful parents, these children often become anxious and fearful themselves. This makes it difficult for them to mature. When they develop through adolescence and adulthood, many of them never outgrow the need for ongoing parental guidance and control. As a result, their parents continue to invade, manipulate, and frequently dominate their lives.</div>

<div class="line_en">What makes a controlling parent so insidious is that the domination usually comes in the guise of concern. Phrases such as, "this is for your own good,"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There's nothing fancy about direct control. It's overt, tangible, right out in the open. "Do as I say or I'll never speak to you again"; "Do as I say or I'll cut off your money"; "If you don't do as I say you'll no longer be a member of this family"; "If you go against my wishes you'll give me a heart attack." There's nothing subtle about it.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'm only doing this for you," and, "only because I love you so much," all mean the same thing: "I'm doing this because I'm so afraid of losing you that I'm willing to make you miserable."</div>

<div class="line_en">Michael, a charming, sweet-faced, 36-year-old advertising executive, provides a good example of this. He came to see me because his six-year marriage to a woman he deeply loved had become extremely shaky as a result of a tug-of-war between his wife and his parents.</div>

<div class="line_en">Direct Control</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Direct control usually involves intimidation and is frequently humiliating. Your feelings and needs must be subordinated to those of your parents. You are dragged into a bottomless pit of ultimatums. Your opinion is worthless; your needs and desires are irrelevant. The imbalance of power is tremendous.</div>

<div class="line_en">The worst incident was about a year after the wedding. We were planning to go out to Boston for my folks' anniversary party when my wife came down with this horrible flu. She was really sick. I didn't want to just leave her, so I called my mother to cancel. Well, first off she bursts into tears. Then she tells me, "If you don't come for our anniversary, I'm going to die." So, I caved in and went to Boston. I got there the morning of the party, but right off the plane, they start in that I should stay the whole week. I didn't say yes or no, but I left the next morning. A day later I get a call from my father: "You're killing your mother. She was up all night crying. I'm afraid she's going to have a stroke." What the hell do they want me to do? Divorce my wife, come back to Boston, and move back into my old room?</div>

<div class="line_en">The real problems didn't start until I moved to California. I think my mother thought it was a temporary move. But when I told her I'd fallen in love and planned to get married, it hit her that I wanted to settle down here. That's when she really started turning on the pressure to bring me back home.</div>

<div class="line_en">Michael's parents could pull his strings from three thousand miles away. I asked him if his parents had ever come around to accepting his wife. Michael became visibly flushed with anger.</div>

<div class="line_en">Michael's crime was that he had become independent. In response, his parents had become desperate, and lashed out with the tactics they knew best: withdrawing love and predicting catastrophe.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Like most controlling parents, Michael's were incredibly self-centered. They felt threatened by Michael's happiness, instead of seeing it as a validation of their parenting skills. Michael's interests were insignificant to them. According to them, he hadn't moved to California for a career opportunity, he had moved to punish them. He hadn't married for love, he had married to spite them. His wife hadn't gotten sick because she contracted a virus, she had gotten sick to deprive them.</div>

<div class="line_en">I wish I had. Every time she'd get clobbered by my parents, I'd expect her to take it. When she'd complain, I'd ask her to be understanding. God, was I an idiot! My parents are slugging away at my wife, and I just keep letting them hurt her.</div>

<div class="line_en">When Michael first came to me, he thought his marriage was the major problem. It didn't take him long to realize that his marriage was merely a victim of the struggle for control that had begun when he moved away from home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Michael's parents were always forcing him to choose between themselves and his wife. And they made every choice an all-or-nothing decision. With directly controlling parents, there is no middle ground. If the adult child tries to gain some control over his own life, he pays the price in guilt, frustrated rage, and a deep sense of disloyalty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Some parents will attack the new relationship with criticism, sarcasm, and predictions of failure. Others, as in Michael's case, will refuse to accept the new partner or even ignore the spouse's very existence. And still others will directly persecute the new partner. It is not unusual for these tactics to create such upheaval that the marriage is undermined.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A child's marriage can be extremely threatening to controlling parents. They see the new spouse as a competitor for their child's devotion. This leads to horrendous battles between parents and spouse, with the adult child caught in a crossfire of divided loyalties.</div>

<div class="line_en">Kim came to see me with a variety of concerns. At 41 she was overweight, unhappy with her work, and divorced with two teenage children. She felt stuck in a rut: she wanted to lose weight, to take some risks in her career, and to find some direction in her life. She was convinced that her problems could all be solved if she could only find Mr. Right.</div>

<div class="line_en">Well, certainly not from my husband. It was more like I had to take care of him. I met him when I was right out of college. He was twenty-seven, still living with his parents, and really floundering about what he was going to do for a living. But he was sensitive and romantic and I fell for him. My father totally disapproved, but I think he was secretly pleased that I picked someone who couldn't get it together. When I insisted on marrying him, my father told me he would support us for a while, and if worse came to worse, he'd give my husband a job in his company. Of course this makes my father sound like a terrific guy, but it gave him an incredible hold over us. Even though I was married, I was still Daddy's little girl. My father kept bailing us out financially, but in return for that, he got to tell us how to live our lives. I was playing house and raising babies and yet…</div>

<div class="line_en">There's no question that my father was the most powerful person in my life. He was really adoring when I was little, but when I started to have a mind of my own, he couldn't handle it. He'd have these screaming fits if I dared to disagree with him. He'd call me terrible names. He was really loud and scary. When I was a teenager, he started using money to keep me in line. Sometimes he'd be incredibly generous, which made me feel really loved and safe. But other times he'd humiliate me by making me beg and cry for anything from movie money to schoolbooks. I was never sure what my crimes were. I just know I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to please him. It was never the same two days in a row. He kept making it tougher.</div>

<div class="line_en">For Kim, trying to please her father was like running a race in which he was always moving the finish line. The harder she ran, the farther he moved it. She couldn't win. He used money for both reward and punishment, without logic or consistency. He was alternately generous and stingy with money, just as he was with love and affection. His mixed messages confused her. Her dependency became entangled with his approval. This confusion continued into Kim's adult life.</div>

<div class="line_en">I encouraged my husband to go to work for my father. What a mistake that was! Now he really had us under his thumb. Everything had to be done his way -- from choosing an apartment to toilet training the kids. He made Jim's life a living hell at work, so Jim finally quit. My father saw this as another example of Jim's worthlessness, even though Jim got another job. My father really lit into me about that and threatened to stop helping us, but then he did a complete about-face and, for Christmas, he bought me a new car. When he handed me the keys, he said, "Don't you wish your husband was rich like me?"</div>

<div class="line_en">All of us manipulate others to varying degrees. Few of us are confident enough to just ask for everything we want in this world, so we develop indirect ways of asking. We don't ask our spouse for a glass of wine, we ask if there's any open; we don't ask our guests to leave at the end of the evening, we yawn; we don't ask an attractive stranger for a phone number, we engage in small talk. Children manipulate parents as much as parents do children. Spouses, friends, and relatives all manipulate one another. Salesmen make a living out of manipulating. There's nothing inherently evil about it; in fact, it's a normal mode of human communication.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But when it becomes a tool for consistent control, manipulation can be exceedingly destructive, especially in a parent-child relationship. Because manipulative parents are so adept at hiding their true motives, their children live in a world of confusion. They know they're being had, but they can't figure out how.</div>

<div class="line_en">One of the most common types of toxic manipulators is the "helper." Instead of letting go, the helper creates situations to make him- or herself "needed" in the adult child's life. This manipulation often comes packaged as well-meaning but unwanted assistance.</div>

<div class="line_en">My mother always made a big deal about all of us coming home for Christmas. Last year, I won a radio contest and got a free trip to Aspen over the holidays. I was really excited since I could never afford a trip like this myself. I love skiing, and it was an incredible chance for me to take my girlfriend someplace great. We'd both been working so hard, this vacation sounded like heaven. But when I broke the news to my mom, she looked like somebody just died. Her eyes glazed up and her lip started trembling, you know, like she was going to cry? Then she said, "It's okay, honey. You have a good time. Maybe we just won't have Christmas dinner this year," which really made me feel like a real turd.</div>

And then my other brother really laid one on me. He said, "Us kids are all she's got. How many more Christmases do you think Mom has left?" Like I'm abandoning her on her deathbed or something. Is that fair, Susan? She's not even sixty, she's in perfect health. I'm sure he got that line straight from my mother's mouth. I'll never miss Christmas again, I'll tell you that.</div>

<div class="line_en">Many toxic parents compare one sibling unfavorably with another to make the target child feel that he's not doing enough to gain parental affection. This motivates the child to do whatever the parents want in order to regain their favor. This divide-and-conquer technique is often unleashed against children who become a little too independent, threatening the balance of the family system.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Whether consciously or unconsciously, these parents manipulate an otherwise normal sibling rivalry into a cruel competition that inhibits the growth of healthy sibling bonds. The effects are far-reaching. In addition to the obvious damage to the child's self-image, negative comparisons create resentments and jealousies between siblings that can color their relationship for a lifetime.</div>

<div class="line_en">I call this "self-defeating rebellion." It is the flip side of capitulation. Healthy rebellion is an active exercise of free choice.

He'd always be giving me the third degree about what I was spending on things and what I bought. And when I made the mistake of telling him, his standard response was, "You idiot! You waste money on luxuries. You should be saving every penny. Hard times will come, they always do, and then you'll need that money." It got to the point that I was terrified to spend a penny.

<div class="line_en">All parents control their children until those children gain control of their own lives. In normal families, the transition occurs soon after adolescence. In toxic families, this healthy separation is delayed for years -- or forever. It can only occur after you have made the changes that will enable you to gain mastery over your own life.</div>

<div class="line_en">Parents who feel good about themselves do not have to control their adult children. But the toxic parents we've met in this chapter operate from a deep sense of dissatisfaction with their lives and a fear of abandonment. Their child's independence is like the loss of a limb to them. As the child grows older, it becomes ever more important for the parent to pull the strings that keep the child dependent. As long as toxic parents can make their son or daughter feel like a child, they can maintain control.</div>
