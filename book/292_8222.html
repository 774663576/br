<div class="line_en">THEY waited patiently for what seemed a very long time, stamping in the snow to keep their feet warm.

<div class="line_en">The Badger, who wore a long dressing-gown, and whose slippers were indeed very down at heel, carried a flat candlestick in his paw and had probably been on his way to bed when their summons sounded. He looked kindly down on them and patted both their heads. 'This is not the sort of night for small animals to be out,' he said paternally. 'I'm afraid you've been up to some of your pranks again, Ratty. But come along; come into the kitchen. There's a first-rate fire there, and supper and everything.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="獾穿着一件长长的晨衣，脚上趿的拖鞋，果然十分破旧。他爪子里擎着一个扁平的烛台，大概在他们敲门时，正要回卧室睡觉。他亲切地低头看着他们，拍拍他俩的脑袋。“这样的夜晚，不是小动物们该出门的时候，”他慈爱地说，“鼠儿，恐怕你又在玩什么鬼把戏了吧。跟我来，上厨房。那儿有一炉好火，还有晚餐，应有尽有。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He shuffled on in front of them, carrying the light, and they followed him, nudging each other in an anticipating sort of way, down a long, gloomy, and, to tell the truth, decidedly shabby passage, into a sort of a central hall; out of which they could dimly see other long tunnel-like passages branching, passages mysterious and without apparent end. But there were doors in the hall as well-stout oaken comfortable-looking doors. One of these the Badger flung open, and at once they found themselves in all the glow and warmth of a large fire-lit kitchen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="獾举着蜡烛，踢里趿拉走在前面，他俩紧随在后，互相会心地触触胳臂肘，表示有好事将临，走进了一条长长的幽暗的破败不堪的过道，来到一间中央大厅模样的房间。从这里，可以看到另一些隧道，是树枝状分岔出去，显得幽深神秘，望不到尽头。不过大厅里也有许多门——厚重的橡木门，看起来很安逸。獾推开了其中的一扇门，霎时间，他们发现自己来到了一间炉火通红暖意融融的大厨房。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The floor was well-worn red brick, and on the wide hearth burnt a fire of logs, between two attractive chimney-corners tucked away in the wall, well out of any suspicion of draught. A couple of high-backed settles, facing each other on either side of the fire, gave further sitting accommodations for the sociably disposed. In the middle of the room stood a long table of plain boards placed on trestles, with benches down each side. At one end of it, where an arm-chair stood pushed back, were spread the remains of the Badger's plain but ample supper. Rows of spotless plates winked from the shelves of the dresser at the far end of the room, and from the rafters overhead hung hams, bundles of dried herbs, nets of onions, and baskets of eggs. It seemed a place where heroes could fitly feast after victory, where weary harvesters could line up in scores along the table and keep their Harvest Home with mirth and song, or where two or three friends of simple tastes could sit about as they pleased and eat and smoke and talk in comfort and contentment. The ruddy brick floor smiled up at the smoky ceiling; the oaken settles, shiny with long wear, exchanged cheerful glances with each other; plates on the dresser grinned at pots on the shelf, and the merry firelight flickered and played over everything without distinction.</div>

<div class="line_en">When at last they were thoroughly toasted, the Badger summoned them to the table, where he had been busy laying a repast. They had felt pretty hungry before, but when they actually saw at last the supper that was spread for them, really it seemed only a question of what they should attack first where all was so attractive, and whether the other things would obligingly wait for them till they had time to give them attention. Conversation was impossible for a long time; and when it was slowly resumed, it was that regrettable sort of conversation that results from talking with your mouth full. The Badger did not mind that sort of thing at all, nor did he take any notice of elbows on the table, or everybody speaking at once. As he did not go into Society himself, he had got an idea that these things belonged to the things that didn't really matter. (We know of course that he was wrong, and took too narrow a view; because they do matter very much, though it would take too long to explain why.) He sat in his arm-chair at the head of the table, and nodded gravely at intervals as the animals told their story; and he did not seem surprised or shocked at anything, and he never said, 'I told you so,' or, 'Just what I always said,' or remarked that they ought to have done so-and-so, or ought not to have done something else. The Mole began to feel very friendly towards him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等他们完全烘干了，獾就请他们去餐桌吃饭，他已为他们备好了一顿美餐。他们早就饥肠辘辘了，可是看到晚饭真的摆在面前时，却不知从哪下手，因为样样食物都叫人馋涎欲滴，吃了这样，不知别样会不会乖乖地等着他们去光顾。好半晌，谈话是根本顾不上了。等到谈话慢慢开始时，又因为嘴里塞满了食物，说起话来也怪为难的。好在獾对这类事毫不介意，也不注意他们是否把胳臂肘撑在桌上，或者是不是几张嘴同时说话。他自己既不参与社交生活，也就形成了一个观念，认为这类事无足轻重。（当然，我们知道他的看法不对，太狭隘了；因为这类事还是必要的，不过要解释清楚为什么重要，太费时间了。）他坐在桌首一张扶手椅上，听两只动物谈他们的遭遇，不时严肃地点点头。不管他们讲什么，他都不露出诧异或震惊的神色，也从不说“我关照过你们”，或者“我一直都这么说的”，或者指出他们本该干什么，不该干什么。鼹鼠对他很抱好感。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The kindly Badger thrust them down on a settle to toast themselves at the fire, and bade them remove their wet coats and boots. Then he fetched them dressing-gowns and slippers, and himself bathed the Mole's shin with warm water and mended the cut with sticking-plaster till the whole thing was just as good as new, if not better. In the embracing light and warmth, warm and dry at last, with weary legs propped up in front of them, and a suggestive clink of plates being arranged on the table behind, it seemed to the storm-driven animals, now in safe anchorage, that the cold and trackless Wild Wood just left outside was miles and miles away, and all that they had suffered in it a half-forgotten dream.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="和善的獾把他俩推到一张高背长凳上坐下，让他们向火，又叫他们脱下湿衣湿靴。他给他们拿来晨衣和拖鞋，并且亲自用温水给鼹鼠洗小腿，用胶布贴住伤口，直到小腿变得完好如初。在光和热的怀抱里，他们终于感到干爽暖和了。他们把疲乏的腿高高伸在前面，听着背后的餐桌上杯盘诱人的丁当声，这两只饱受暴风雪袭击的动物，现在稳坐在安全的避风港。他们刚刚摆脱的又冷又没出路的野林，仿佛已经离他们老远老远，他们遭受的种种磨难，似乎都成了一个几乎忘掉的梦。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When supper was really finished at last, and each animal felt that his skin was now as tight as was decently safe, and that by this time he didn't care a hang for anybody or anything, they gathered round the glowing embers of the great wood fire, and thought how jolly it was to be sitting up SO late, and SO independent, and SO full; and after they had chatted for a time about things in general, the Badger said heartily, 'Now then! tell us the news from your part of the world. How's old Toad going on?'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="晚饭终于吃完了，每只动物现在都感到肚子饱饱的，又十分安全，不必惧怕任何人或任何事，于是他们围坐在红光熠熠的一大炉柴火余烬旁，心想，这么晚的时光，吃得这么饱，这么无拘无束地坐着，多么开心啊。他们泛泛地闲聊了一阵以后，獾便亲切地说：“好吧，给我说说你们那边的新闻吧。老蟾怎样啦？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'Oh, from bad to worse,' said the Rat gravely, while the Mole, cocked up on a settle and basking in the firelight, his heels higher than his head, tried to look properly mournful. 'Another smash-up only last week, and a bad one. You see, he will insist on driving himself, and he's hopelessly incapable. If he'd only employ a decent, steady, well-trained animal, pay him good wages, and leave everything to him, he'd get on all right. But no; he's convinced he's a heaven-born driver, and nobody can teach him anything; and all the rest follows.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“唉，越来越糟啦，”河鼠心情沉重地说。鼹鼠这时蜷缩在高背凳上，烤着火，把脚后跟翘得比头还高，也竭力做出悲伤的样子。“就在上星期，又出了一次车祸，而且撞得很重。你瞧，他硬要亲自开车，可他又特无能。要是雇一个正经、稳重、训练有素的动物为他开车，付给高薪，把一切交给他，那就什么问题也没有了。可他偏不，他自以为是个天生的、无师自通的好驾驶员，这么一来，车祸就接连不断了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">His two friends assented, quite understanding his point. No animal, according to the rules of animal-etiquette, is ever expected to do anything strenuous, or heroic, or even moderately active during the off-season of winter. All are sleepy-some actually asleep. All are weather-bound, more or less; and all are resting from arduous days and nights, during which every muscle in them has been severely tested, and every energy kept at full stretch.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两位朋友都同意他的话，因为他们理解他的苦衷。按照动物界的规矩，在冬闲季节，不能指望任何动物去做任何费劲的或者英勇的举动，哪怕只是比较活跃的举动。所有的动物都昏昏欲睡，有的真的在睡。所有的动物，多多少少都由于气候的关系，呆在家里，闭门不出。在前一段时间，所有的动物全身的肌肉都绷得紧紧的，体力都耗费到极度。所以，经过前一段日日夜夜的辛勤劳动后，所有的动物都歇了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">'Smashes, or machines?' asked the Rat. 'Oh, well, after all, it's the same thing-with Toad. This is the seventh. As for the others-you know that coach-house of his? Well, it's piled up-literally piled up to the roof-with fragments of motor-cars, none of them bigger than your hat! That accounts for the other six-so far as they can be accounted for.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你是说——出的车祸，还是买的车？”河鼠问。 “噢，对蟾蜍来说，反正都是一回事。这已是第七回了。至于另外的——你见过他那间车库吧？哼，全堆满了——半点也不夸张，一直堆到天花板——全是汽车碎片，没有一块有你的帽子大！这就是另外那六次的归宿——如果算得上是归宿。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Badger went through a bit of hard thinking. 'Now look here!' he said at last, rather severely; 'of course you know I can't do anything NOW?'</div>

Badger! we're his friends-oughtn't we to do something?'</div>

The reason was, of course, that he being naturally an underground animal by birth and breeding, the situation of Badger's house exactly suited him and made him feel at home; while the Rat, who slept every night in a bedroom the windows of which opened on a breezy river, naturally felt the atmosphere still and oppressive.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“打吃过晚饭，他都睡过两三次啦，”鼹鼠笑着说。他自己却挺清醒，甚至挺精神，虽然他也不明白为什么会这样。当然，这是因为，他原本就是一只地下生地下长的动物，獾的住宅的位置正合他心意，所以他感到舒适自在。而河鼠呢，他夜夜都睡在敞开窗户的卧室里，窗外就是一条微风习习的河，自然会觉得这里的空气静止而憋闷啰。">查看中文翻译</div>

The hedgehogs dropped their spoons, rose to their feet, and ducked their heads respectfully as the two entered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="遵照关怀备至的獾的嘱咐，两只困乏的动物第二天很晚才下楼去吃早饭。他们看到，炉里已经升起明灿灿的火，有两只小刺猬正坐在餐桌旁的板凳上，就着木碗吃麦片粥。一见他们进来，刺猬立刻放下匙子，站起来，恭恭敬敬向他们深鞠一躬。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This explanation, of course, was thoroughly understood by every one present. The fact is, as already set forth, when you live a life of intense activity for six months in the year, and of comparative or actual somnolence for the other six, during the latter period you cannot be continually pleading sleepiness when there are people about or things to be done. The excuse gets monotonous. The animals well knew that Badger, having eaten a hearty breakfast, had retired to his study and settled himself in an arm-chair with his legs up on another and a red cotton handkerchief over his face, and was being 'busy' in the usual way at this time of the year.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个解释，在场的每一位自然都心领神会。事实上，就像我们前面提到过的，一年当中你有半年过着极度紧张活跃的生活，而另外半年处在半睡或全睡的状态，在后一段时间里，如果家里来了客人，或者有事需要办理，你总不好老是推说自己犯困吧。这样的解释说多了，会叫人厌烦。几只动物都明白，獾饱饱地吃过一顿早饭以后，回到书房，就会倒在一张扶手椅上，双腿架在另一张扶手椅上，脸上盖着条红手帕，忙他在这个季节照例要“忙”的事去了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">'Thought I should find you here all right,' said the Otter cheerfully. 'They were all in a great state of alarm along River Bank when I arrived this morning. Rat never been home all night-nor Mole either-something dreadful must have happened, they said; and the snow had covered up all your tracks, of course. But I knew that when people were in any fix they mostly went to Badger, or else Badger got to know of it somehow, so I came straight off here, through the Wild Wood and the snow! My! it was fine, coming through the snow as the red sun was rising and showing against the black tree-trunks! As you went along in the stillness, every now and then masses of snow slid off the branches suddenly with a flop! making you jump and run for cover. Snow-castles and snow-caverns had sprung up out of nowhere in the night-and snow bridges, terraces, ramparts-I could have stayed and played with them for hours. Here and there great branches had been torn away by the sheer weight of the snow, and robins perched and hopped on them in their perky conceited way, just as if they had done it themselves. A ragged string of wild geese passed overhead, high on the grey sky, and a few rooks whirled over the trees, inspected, and flapped off homewards with a disgusted expression; but I met no sensible being to ask the news of. About halfway across I came on a rabbit sitting on a stump, cleaning his silly face with his paws. He was a pretty scared animal when I crept up behind him and placed a heavy forepaw on his shoulder. I had to cuff his head once or twice to get any sense out of it at all. At last I managed to extract from him that Mole had been seen in the Wild Wood last night by one of them. It was the talk of the burrows, he said, how Mole, Mr. Rat's particular friend, was in a bad fix; how he had lost his way, and "They" were up and out hunting, and were chivvying him round and round. "Then why didn't any of you DO something?" I asked. "You mayn't be blest with brains, but there are hundreds and hundreds of you, big, stout fellows, as fat as butter, and your burrows running in all directions, and you could have taken him in and made him safe and comfortable, or tried to, at all events." "What, US?" he merely said: "DO something? us rabbits?" So I cuffed him again and left him. There was nothing else to be done. At any rate, I had learnt something; and if I had had the luck to meet any of "Them" I'd have learnt something more-or THEY would.'</div>

<div class="line_en">The Badger simply beamed on him. 'That's exactly what I say,' he replied. 'There's no security, or peace and tranquillity, except underground. And then, if your ideas get larger and you want to expand-why, a dig and a scrape, and there you are! If you feel your house is a bit too big, you stop up a hole or two, and there you are again! No builders, no tradesmen, no remarks passed on you by fellows looking over your wall, and, above all, no WEATHER. Look at Rat, now. A couple of feet of flood water, and he's got to move into hired lodgings; uncomfortable, inconveniently situated, and horribly expensive. Take Toad. I say nothing against Toad Hall; quite the best house in these parts, AS a house. But supposing a fire breaks out-where's Toad? Supposing tiles are blown off, or walls sink or crack, or windows get broken-where's Toad? Supposing the rooms are draughty-I HATE a draught myself-where's Toad? No, up and out of doors is good enough to roam about and get one's living in; but underground to come back to at last-that's my idea of HOME'</div>

<div class="line_en">After luncheon, accordingly, when the other two had settled themselves into the chimney-corner and had started a heated argument on the subject of EELS, the Badger lighted a lantern and bade the Mole follow him. Crossing the hall, they passed down one of the principal tunnels, and the wavering light of the lantern gave glimpses on either side of rooms both large and small, some mere cupboards, others nearly as broad and imposing as Toad's dining-hall. A narrow passage at right angles led them into another corridor, and here the same thing was repeated. The Mole was staggered at the size, the extent, the ramifications of it all; at the length of the dim passages, the solid vaultings of the crammed store-chambers, the masonry everywhere, the pillars, the arches, the pavements. 'How on earth, Badger,' he said at last, 'did you ever find time and strength to do all this? It's astonishing!'</div>

I see you don't understand, and I must explain it to you. Well, very long ago, on the spot where the Wild Wood waves now, before ever it had planted itself and grown up to what it now is, there was a city-a city of people, you know. Here, where we are standing, they lived, and walked, and talked, and slept, and carried on their business. Here they stabled their horses and feasted, from here they rode out to fight or drove out to trade. They were a powerful people, and rich, and great builders. They built to last, for they thought their city would last for ever.'</div>

<div class="line_en">'When they went,' continued the Badger, 'the strong winds and persistent rains took the matter in hand, patiently, ceaselessly, year after year. Perhaps we badgers too, in our small way, helped a little-who knows? It was all down, down, down, gradually-ruin and levelling and disappearance. Then it was all up, up, up, gradually, as seeds grew to saplings, and saplings to forest trees, and bramble and fern came creeping in to help. Leaf-mould rose and obliterated, streams in their winter freshets brought sand and soil to clog and to cover, and in course of time our home was ready for us again, and we moved in. Up above us, on the surface, the same thing happened. Animals arrived, liked the look of the place, took up their quarters, settled down, spread, and flourished. They didn't bother themselves about the past-they never do; they're too busy. The place was a bit humpy and hillocky, naturally, and full of holes; but that was rather an advantage. And they don't bother about the future, either-the future when perhaps the people will move in again-for a time-as may very well be. The Wild Wood is pretty well populated by now; with all the usual lot, good, bad, and indifferent-I name no names. It takes all sorts to make a world.

<div class="line_en">The Rat was nevertheless still anxious to be off and attend to his river, so the Badger, taking up his lantern again, led the way along a damp and airless tunnel that wound and dipped, part vaulted, part hewn through solid rock, for a weary distance that seemed to be miles. At last daylight began to show itself confusedly through tangled growth overhanging the mouth of the passage; and the Badger, bidding them a hasty good-bye, pushed them hurriedly through the opening, made everything look as natural as possible again, with creepers, brushwood, and dead leaves, and retreated.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，河鼠还是急着要回去照看他的河，于是獾又打起灯笼，在前面领路，穿过一条曲曲弯弯的隧道，洞里潮湿气闷，滴着水，一部分有穹顶，一部分是从坚硬的岩石里凿开的。走了很累人的一段长路，似乎有好几里长，末了，透过悬在隧道出口处杂乱的草木，终于看到了零碎的天光。獾向他们匆匆道了别，快快地把他们推出洞口，然后用藤蔓、断枝、枯叶把洞口隐蔽好，尽可能不露痕迹，就转身回去了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They found themselves standing on the very edge of the Wild Wood. Rocks and brambles and tree-roots behind them, confusedly heaped and tangled; in front, a great space of quiet fields, hemmed by lines of hedges black on the snow, and, far ahead, a glint of the familiar old river, while the wintry sun hung red and low on the horizon. The Otter, as knowing all the paths, took charge of the party, and they trailed out on a bee-line for a distant stile. Pausing there a moment and looking back, they saw the whole mass of the Wild Wood, dense, menacing, compact, grimly set in vast white surroundings; simultaneously they turned and made swiftly for home, for firelight and the familiar things it played on, for the voice, sounding cheerily outside their window, of the river that they knew and trusted in all its moods, that never made them afraid with any amazement.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们发现自己已站在野林的边边上。后面，岩石、荆棘、树根，杂乱无章地互相堆砌缠绕，前面，是一望无际的宁静的田野，被雪地衬得黑黝黝的一行行树篱，镶着田野的边。再往前，就见那条老河在闪闪发光，冬天的太阳红彤彤的，低悬在天边。水獭熟悉所有的小道，他负责带领他们走一条直线，来到远处的一个栅栏门。他们在那儿歇了歇脚，回头眺望，只见那座庞然大物的野林，密密层层，严严实实，阴阴森森，嵌在一望无际的白色原野当中，显得好怕人。他们不约而同掉转身来，急忙赶路回家，奔向炉火和火光映照下熟悉的东西，奔向窗外那条欢唱的河。他们熟悉那条河的种种脾性，他们信赖它，因为它绝不会做出使他们惊恐的怪异行径。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As he hurried along, eagerly anticipating the moment when he would be at home again among the things he knew and liked, the Mole saw clearly that he was an animal of tilled field and hedge-row, linked to the ploughed furrow, the frequented pasture, the lane of evening lingerings, the cultivated garden-plot. For others the asperities, the stubborn endurance, or the clash of actual conflict, that went with Nature in the rough; he must be wise, must keep to the pleasant places in which his lines were laid and which held adventure enough, in their way, to last for a lifetime.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="鼹鼠匆匆赶路，急切巴望着到家，回到他熟悉和喜爱的事物中去。这时，他才清楚地看到，他原是一只属于耕地和树篱的动物，与他息息相关的是犁沟，是他常来常往的牧场，是他在暮色留连忘返的树夹道，是人们培植的花园草坪。至于严酷的环境，顽强的忍受，或者同狂暴的大自然进行的货真价实的冲突较量，让别的动物去承受吧。他必须放聪明些，老老实实厮守着他的乐土。那是他祖祖辈辈繁衍生息的所在，那里也自有它的种种探险奇遇，足够他消遣解闷一辈子的了。">查看中文翻译</div>
