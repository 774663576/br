<div class="line_en">Thankfully they made it to the next safe house well before the sun went down. It was another stone cottage, and Dylan began to wonder if that was her doing as well. Almost all of the safe houses were the same. Were they supposed to be her idea of sanctuary, of home? She tried to think about where she might have made that connection. The flat she lived in -- had lived in, she corrected herself -- with Joan was a red sandstone apartment surrounded by countless other identical buildings. Her gran had lived in the countryside in an isolated place before she died, but that had been a modern bungalow with over-fussy landscaped gardens dotted with ridiculous stone lions and gnomes. She couldn't think of anywhere else that had been like home.</div>

<div class="line_en">Except, well, her dad had mentioned his place when they'd talked on the phone. A small stone house, he'd called it. Old-fashioned, with just enough room for him and Anna, the dog. Was this the image her mind had conjured up of that place? Perhaps her subconscious was trying to give her a little of the thing she'd hoped for but had never managed to attain.</div>

<div class="line_en">Although slightly tumble-down, there was something comforting about the place, it felt almost like coming home after a long, hard journey. The front door was solid oak, weather-beaten but strong. The windows were encrusted with the sort of grime that accumulates through long-term exposure to the fierce Scottish weather, but they were wooden sash and looked in good repair despite the paint peeling from them. There was no defined garden, but a little paved path had been laid, leading up to the front door. Weeds and grass were peeking up through the cracks, but had not yet reclaimed the ground.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这房子虽然有些轻微的破败，但还是让人感到舒适安慰，就像是经过了漫长而艰难的旅程回到了家里一样。前门是硬橡木做的，尽管历经风霜雨雪，但仍然很坚固。窗子长期暴露在苏格兰恶劣的天气中，外面结了一层灰尘与污垢。虽然上面的漆正在剥落，但木质窗框看上去依然完好。这里没有精致的花园，但门前铺了一条小路。地面的缝隙里已经悄然钻出了一些杂草，但总算还没有完全占领地面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For a moment she imagined the door opening and a man walking out. In her imagination he was handsome, strong and kind-looking. She smiled at the thought, then realised that was all it was. She had never even seen a picture of her dad, couldn't remember what he'd looked like before he left. Shaking her head to chase these hard thoughts away, she followed Tristan towards the front door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有时候，她会想象着门开了，一个男人走了出来。在她的想象中，他面容英俊、身体强壮、慈祥和善。想到这些她自己也不禁笑了，然后意识到自己对父亲的想象也就仅此而已了。她从来没有见过一张父亲的照片，也实在回忆不起来他离开之前的样子。她摇摇头，把这些冥思苦想全都驱散到一旁，跟着崔斯坦向前门走去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tristan led the way inside and the cosy feel continued. This cottage did not have the same abandoned, disordered look the others had had, and Dylan wondered idly if it was because she was becoming more at home in the wasteland. There was a bed at one end with a table beside that which held a large but half-burned candle and an old chest of drawers. A table and chairs sat in the middle of the room, in front of the fireplace, and at the other end was a small kitchen with a chipped and grubby Belfast sink. Dylan approached it, eyeing the old-fashioned taps and wondering whether they worked. Her jeans were still encrusted with mud and the grey zippy top that she had chosen back in the flat before any of this craziness had started was now a patchwork of stains, mud splashes and little tears. She didn't even want to think about what her face looked like.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="崔斯坦带头进了屋子，温馨安逸的感觉还在延续。这间小屋没有其他小屋那种荒废已久、乱七八糟的样子。迪伦瞎想道，莫不是自己已经在荒原上越待越自在了？屋子的一头有一张床，旁边是张桌子，上面放着一截已经燃了一半的大蜡烛，桌子上还配有破旧的五斗橱。屋子的正中、壁炉前摆着桌椅。在屋子的另一端是间小厨房，里面有一个带着豁口的、脏兮兮的水槽。迪伦上前观瞧，看着老式的水龙头，不知道现在它们还能不能用。她的牛仔裤上还沾着一层泥。在这一切蠢事发生之前，她返回公寓换上了一件灰色罩衫。现在衣服的风帽上已经被污迹染得斑斑点点，还有些被撕破的小口子。她甚至不愿意去想自己此时看上去是什么“尊容”了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Although the taps were rusted and the sink was caked in mud, Dylan felt optimistic as she turned the cold tap. At first nothing happened and she frowned, disappointed, but then a groaning and gurgling came from under the sink. She stepped back warily, just as the tap spurted out a torrent of brown water. It bounced off the sides of the sink and just missed Dylan as she jumped further back. After a few seconds of spewing, the flow settled down into a trickle that looked fairly clean.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管水管锈迹斑斑，水槽上结了一层污泥，但迪伦拧开冷水管的时候还是满心期待的。一开始水管里什么也没出来，她皱了皱眉，感到有些失望。但紧接着水槽下面传来了嘎嘎吱吱的声音，她小心翼翼地退了几步，此时水管中喷出了一股棕色的水。水流撞在水槽壁上弹射起来，要不是迪伦及时往后跳了两步，差点又被脏水溅到。在喷射了几秒钟之后，水流开始平稳下来，变成了看上去很清澈的涓涓细流。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh yes," said Dylan, looking forward to being able to have a wash for the first time in days. She splashed the water on her face, shivering at the icy temperature. Playfully she scooped up a handful of the water and turned to throw it at Tristan. She stopped short, the water falling through her slackened fingers to bounce off the flagstoned floor. The room was empty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“太好了。”迪伦说，指望着这次能洗这么多天来头一个澡。她用水洗了把脸，被冰水激得打了个寒噤。她顽皮地捧起水，转身想对崔斯坦来个突然袭击。可是她却突然停住了，水顺着她松开的指缝落在了石板地面上，水花四溅。屋子里空无一人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Tristan!" she screamed, panic-filled. The door was standing open and, though it was still light, night was fast approaching. Did she dare go outside? She could not be alone again. That thought was her deciding factor and she started purposefully forward, just as Tristan appeared in the doorway.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“崔斯坦！”她大喊起来，声音里充满了惊恐。屋门洞开，尽管仍有亮光，可黑夜正在迅速逼近。她敢冒险出去吗？可她不能再孤身一人了。一想到这些，她马上拿定了主意，开始决然地向前走去，正撞见了出现在门口的崔斯坦。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"What?" he asked innocently.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“怎么了？”他一脸无辜地问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There's still twenty minutes of light left. I'll stay outside and give you some privacy. I'll be just by the front door," he promised. "You'll be able to talk to me if you want to." He smiled reassuringly and walked back outside. She wandered over to the doorway and peeked outside. He was seated on a rock. He glanced up and caught her looking at him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“离天黑还有二十分钟，我去外面待一会儿给你留点儿私密空间。我就在前门旁边，”他保证说，“你要是想和我说话随时都行。”他安慰地一笑，走出门去。她溜达到门口，偷偷往外观瞧，只见他坐在一块岩石上。他抬眼一瞥，看到她在看着自己。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You can shut the door if you want. I promise not to look if you want to leave it open, though." He winked, embarrassing her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你愿意的话也可以把门关上。不过即使你想让门这样开着，我也保证不偷看。”他眨巴眨巴眼睛，迪伦顿时大窘。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I was just outside." He looked at her stricken face. "Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我就在外面。”他看着她那张霜打了似的脸说，“对不起，我不是故意要吓你的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She huffed and went to shut the door, but then thought better of it and left it open. Fidgeting where she stood, she thought about the idea of washing -- and she was desperate for a proper wash -- with the door open and him just outside. Uncomfortable. But then she thought about shutting the door and being alone inside. The terror of being abandoned was still too raw. Even the thought made her heart flutter with alarm. She decided to leave it slightly ajar, and closed it on his smirking face, leaving a small gap. Just in case.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦气鼓鼓地关上了门，但转念一想又把门打开了。她急不可耐要好好洗个澡，但想到要开着门洗澡，而且门外还有个人，就又站在那里焦躁不安起来，太不舒服了。然后她想到了关上门一个人在屋里，被抛弃的恐惧感还记忆犹新，哪怕这样想想也让她的心脏惊惧狂跳。于是她决定微微开道门缝，挡住他扬扬得意的笑脸，以备万一。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You done?" he asked, sneaking a quick look through the door. "It's just that it's getting dark."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“完事了吗？”他问着，从门缝偷偷往里面瞥了一眼，“天要黑了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan nodded gratefully. She was still cold from washing in the freezing water. Again it took him a ridiculously short time and flames were roaring in the grate. He stood up and observed her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦感激地点点头。她刚洗了冷水澡，现在还在瑟瑟发抖。他又一次不可思议地只用了一点点时间，就让火苗从壁炉里蹿了上来。他站起来，仔细打量着她。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Eyeing the door uncomfortably, she stripped off her clothes and, using a sliver of soap that she found by the sink, began to wash as quickly as possible. It was absolutely freezing and she considered getting Tristan to start the fire, but knew that by the time it got going, it would be so dark that they'd both have to be inside for safety. Gritting her teeth to stop them chattering, she tried to be as thorough and as speedy as possible. There was no option but to put her dirty clothes back on. Dylan wrinkled her nose as she yanked on her mud-caked jeans. She was just pulling her T-shirt over her head when Tristan knocked on the door. Although the T-shirt was fairly baggy and not at all see-through, she snatched up her grey jumper and yanked it quickly on, zipping it right up to her chin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她不安地看了一眼门，然后脱掉衣服，将就用在水槽里找到的一小块肥皂，飞快地洗起来。屋里的寒气快把人冻僵了，她想到了让崔斯坦回来生火，但清楚等火好了天也黑了，那时候他们为安全起见都必须待在屋里。她为了不让牙齿打战咬紧牙关，尽量洗得又快又彻底。洗完澡后，她只得重新穿上了脏衣服。迪伦提上那件满是污泥的牛仔裤时，不由皱了一下鼻子。她刚把T恤衫套过头顶，崔斯坦的敲门声就响了。尽管那件T恤很宽松，而且布料一点也不透，她还是抓起了灰色的外套，急忙把衣服穿上，把拉链一直拉到了下巴。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tristan smiled wryly and walked over to the chest of drawers. "There's some stuff in here. Not sure how good the fit will be, but we could try and wash your clothes if you want. Here." He tossed a T-shirt and some tracksuit bottoms at her. They were a little big, but the thought of being able to wash her own clothes was very appealing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="崔斯坦莞尔一笑，走到五斗橱那里，“这里倒有些衣服，就是不知道穿着合不合身。不过我们可以试一试。你愿意的话，就在这儿把你的衣服也洗了。”他给她扔过来一件T恤和几件运动裤。衣裤都有点大，但是她想到能把自己的脏衣服给洗了还是很愿意的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She nodded. "Wish I had a change of clothes, though," she sighed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她点点头，“不过，真想换换衣服啊。”她叹了口气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan mulled it over and decided that going commando for one night was a fair price to pay for some clean clothes. She was going to have to change, though, and it was too dark to ask Tristan to go outside. She squirmed from foot to foot, holding the clothes against her chest. Tristan spotted her discomfort.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦仔细想了想，拿定了主意，只要能有干净衣服穿，一晚上不穿内裤也值了。她这就要开始换衣服，但天已经黑了，不能再把崔斯坦请到外面去了。她的两只脚来回扭来扭去，把衣服捂在胸口。崔斯坦也看出了她的尴尬。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"How was the wash? Better?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“澡洗得怎么样？舒服多了吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'll go and stand over here," he said, crossing the room and taking up position in front of the sink. "You can change by the bed." He looked away from her and stared out of the small kitchen window. Dylan scurried over to the bed and, after a quick glance at Tristan to confirm that he was indeed staring in the opposite direction, she whipped off her clothes as fast as possible.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我会站到那边去的。”他一边说着，一边穿过了屋子，站到了水槽边，“你可以在窗边换衣服。”他的目光从她身上移开，从小厨房的窗子向外看去。迪伦急忙走到床边，匆忙瞟了一眼崔斯坦，确定他的确是盯着另一个方向看，这才以最快的速度匆匆脱掉衣服。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tristan remained resolutely staring at the glass, but the dark outside and the firelight inside turned the window into a mirror. He could see Dylan pull first her jumper, then her T-shirt over her head. Her skin was smooth and pale, her outline travelling down from strong shoulders to a narrow, delicate waist. As she shrugged out of her jeans he squeezed his eyes shut, trying to hold on to some vestige of chivalry. He counted to thirty in his head -- slowly, making each number match a breath -- and when he opened his eyes again she stood there in the too big clothes staring at his back. He turned to face her and smiled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="崔斯坦依然坚定地盯着那块玻璃，然而漆黑的户外和火光闪烁的室内把玻璃变成了一面镜子。他能看到迪伦先脱掉了外套，然后又褪掉了T恤。她的皮肤光滑而白皙，肩膀结实，腰窄而纤细。当她把牛仔裤抖掉的时候，他闭紧了眼，尽量想保持一点绅士风度。他在头脑里慢慢数了三十下—每数一下正好呼吸一次—等他再次睁开眼睛时，只见她穿着那件过于宽大的衣服站在那儿，正盯着他的后背。他扭过头冲她一笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan widened her eyes, mortified at the thought of him getting a peek at her natty underwear. Why, oh why, hadn't she died in some glorious Victoria's Secrets ensemble?</div>

<div class="line_en">"Nice," he commented.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“漂亮。”他评论道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She flushed and tugged at the T-shirt. She felt very awkward being braless. She folded her arms across her chest as extra protection.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“要我帮忙洗衣服吗？”他主动提出申请。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, s'okay," she replied. She grabbed the dirty clothes from the bed and held them tightly against her body as she crossed the room, trying to keep her bra and knickers hidden in the centre of the ball. She plonked them down on the counter and spent five minutes scrubbing the sink with an old scouring pad to try and clean off the muck before uncoiling the rusty plug chain and stuffing in the plug. She turned both taps on full -- although the stream from the hot tap remained icy cold -- but couldn't get more than a dribble. The sink was going to take an age to fill.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，我可以自己来。”她回答道。迪伦从床上抓起了那堆脏衣服，穿过屋子的时候把它们紧紧贴身抱着，尽量把她的文胸和内裤藏在这堆衣服中间。她把它们丢在台子上，花了五分钟时间先用一块陈年的百洁布清洗水槽除去淤泥，然后展开生锈的水槽塞链，把塞子塞紧。她把两个龙头同时开到最大，不过那“热水管”里流出的水依然冰冷无比，两只龙头的水量不过也只有涓涓细流而已。看来想要把水槽填满得等上一阵子了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dylan stood at the counter for a moment, but the heat of the fire lured her over to the middle of the room. Tristan was already seated at one of the chairs, leaning back comfortably with his feet propped on a stool. Dylan sat on the second chair and drew her knees up to her chest, balancing her feet on the edge of the seat. She wrapped her arms around her legs and looked over at Tristan. Now was the time to get the rest of the story.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦在台子旁边站了一会儿，然而壁炉的热力却把她吸引到了屋子中间。崔斯坦已经在一把椅子上坐定，舒服地向后靠着，脚还跷在一只小凳子上。迪伦也找了把椅子坐下，脚蹬在椅子的边缘，膝盖靠着胸口。她双臂抱腿，注视着崔斯坦。现在该把剩下的故事讲完了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“那个……”她的声音很轻。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He looked over at her. "So?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他望着她，“什么？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It was dark," he began. His voice was low, hypnotic, and Dylan was instantly entranced by his words, seeing in her mind's eye everything he described. "They pulled me down through the ground, and I couldn't breathe. The dirt filled my mouth and nose. If I hadn't known better, I would have thought I was dying. It seemed to last for ever, just going down and down deeper into the earth. Gravel and stones scraped at me, but the force of the demons kept me tunnelling down. Finally, they pulled me through something and then I was falling. The demons were slashing at me again, cackling in delight and diving close to me so that I was twisting and somersaulting through the air. Then I hit something, something hard. I crashed into it and felt like I'd broken every bone in my body. Of course I hadn't, but the pain was excruciating. I couldn't move. The agony… I've never felt anything like it. The demons were swarming all over me, but I couldn't even defend myself." Tristan broke off suddenly, looking over towards the kitchen. "The sink's about to overflow."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“一片漆黑。”他开始讲自己的遭遇，他的声音有一种催眠师似的低沉。迪伦很快就听得入了迷，随着他的描述在头脑中想象着那些画面，“它们拖着我穿过地面，我根本无法呼吸，嘴里和鼻子里都是泥土。如果事先不清楚状况的话，我还以为自己马上要死了。就这样过了很久，不停地朝地下越坠越深。我的身体蹭过沙砾和石块，但魔鬼们还是合力把我往下拖。最后，它们的利爪又开始对准我连劈带砍，兴奋地发出狂笑，朝我俯冲过来，于是我就在空中扭动翻滚。然后我撞到了某个东西，一个坚硬的东西。这一撞让我感觉浑身每块骨头都碎了。当然，这只是我的感觉而已，但是钻心的疼痛让我动弹不得。那种痛感……我以前从来没有体验过。魔鬼们把我团团围住，但我却无力自保。”崔斯坦突然停下来，转头看着厨房，“水槽里的水快溢出来了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He stared into the flames as he answered. Dylan felt that he wasn't seeing the fire, but was back outside with the demons.</div>

<div class="line_en">He needed to take a break, to pause and gather his thoughts. It disconcerted him. Tristan had never been caught before, had never been overpowered by the demons. He'd told Dylan that protecting the soul came first, and that was true, but only to a point. Self-preservation always took over, and so sometimes souls were lost. Not this one, though, she was too special. He would sacrifice himself to keep her safe, and these pains were a small price to pay.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他需要休息一下，停下来整理一下思绪。这次的事让他非常困惑不安，之前他还从没有被捉住过，也从没有被魔鬼击败过。他曾告诉迪伦保护灵魂优先，这当然是真的，但只有在某种程度上来说才是如此。自保经常会占据上风，所以有时灵魂会因此被魔鬼抓住。但眼前的这个灵魂太特殊了。他就算牺牲了自己也要保证她的安全，那些伤痛跟这个相比算不了什么。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh." Dylan had been mesmerised by his words and the look in his eyes, and had forgotten about the trickle of water slowly filling up the sink. She scurried out of the chair and, with some difficulty, twisted the rusty tap until the water stopped. She dipped the soap into the freezing water and rubbed it vigorously between her palms, trying to coax some suds out of it. She managed to make a decent lather before the slither gave up and crumbled into tiny pieces in her hands. Next she grabbed her clothes and dunked them in the water. She left them to soak and skipped back across the room, plonking herself down opposite Tristan and looking at him expectantly. He smiled slightly. Was this how it felt to be a parent, telling a story at bedtime? Only this story was more likely to give nightmares.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦。”迪伦刚才被他的话语和眼神深深吸引住了，完全忘掉了正在慢慢灌满水槽的涓涓细流。她急忙跳下椅子，费了很大的劲才把生锈的水龙头拧紧。她把肥皂在冰水里浸了浸，然后把它在手掌间使劲搓了搓，尽量在肥皂块失去光滑在手上脆裂之前搓出了一些像模像样的肥皂泡。紧接着，她抓起衣服，把它们泡在水里。趁着衣服吸水的工夫，她又蹦蹦跳跳地折返回来，一屁股坐在崔斯坦对面，眼含期待地看着他。他淡然一笑，家长给孩子讲睡前故事就是这种感觉吧？只不过他的这个故事很可能会让人做噩梦。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You needed me. That brought me back. I… I didn't know that could happen -- it never has before -- but you called to me. I heard you. I heard you, and the next thing I knew, I was back at the entrance to the valley. You saved me, Dylan." He stared at her, eyes warm and full of wonder.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你需要我，就是这个想法把我带了回来。我……我不知道会发生这种事—以前从没发生过—但你当时在召唤我。我听到了，我听到了你的召唤。等我再次清醒过来时，就已经在谷口了。是你救了我，迪伦。”他注视着她，眼神温暖，其中写满了惊叹。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'm sorry," he murmured softly. "I came back at the other side of the valley. I…" he shifted uncomfortably. "I was moving a little slower. It took all day to walk to you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对不起，”他轻声低语，“我回到的是山谷另一端的入口。我……”他很不自在地转开了话题，“我走得有点慢，走了一天才到你这儿。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan opened her mouth, but shock robbed her of speech. An image flashed into her mind of herself, cowed on the floor, her back holding the door closed and crying for Tristan. Is that what had done it? That was insane, impossible. But then she thought about the odd things that had happened in the last few days. Clearly things could happen in this world that bent the laws of reality.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦张大了嘴，因为太吃惊，竟一时说不出话来。她脑海里立即浮现出一幅画面—自己坐在地板上心惊胆战，背靠着紧闭的屋门，哭喊着崔斯坦的名字。就是她这个举动救了崔斯坦吗？简直太疯狂、太不可思议了。不过，接下来她又想到了过去几天里发生的那些怪事，很明显不合现实世界法则的事却可以在这里发生。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I was so glad to see you. It was terrifying being alone. But more than that…" Dylan blushed and looked away from him into the flames. "I was frightened that they were hurting you, wherever you were. And they did." She reached out to touch his battered face, but he pulled away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“见到你真是太好了，一个人孤孤单单真可怕。而且……”迪伦说着突然红了脸，转过眼不去看他，注视起炉火来，“不管你在哪儿，我都害怕它们伤害你。它们也真的对你下毒手了。”她伸出手抚摸他那张伤痕累累的脸，可他却躲开了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was no clothes horse, so Dylan turned the chairs so their backs faced the flames and she hung her clothes over the backs and arms to dry. She tried to find a discreet place to hang her knickers, but in the end gave up and settled for a spot that at least ensured they would be dry. With the chairs taken up, there was nowhere to sit except the bed. Tristan was already there, lounging lazily and watching her with a strange expression on his face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="屋里没有晾衣架。迪伦把椅子转过来，椅背对着炉火，然后把衣服搭在椅背和扶手上晾干。她努力想找一个稳妥、不打眼的地方挂她的内裤，不过最终还是只得放弃这样的想法。现在这个地方起码能保证它们会干，也算差强人意了。现在椅子都被衣服占了，所以除了床再没有可坐的地方。崔斯坦已经懒洋洋地躺在那儿了，脸上带着一种奇怪的表情看着她。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Thanks, but I can manage," she mumbled, pushing past him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“谢谢，但我能行的。”她低声说着，侧身从他旁边挤了过去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'll help you hang them." Tristan wandered up behind her and his voice in her ear made her jump, dropping her bra on the stone floor. He bent to pick it up for her, but she snatched it out of his reaching hand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我帮你晾衣服吧。”崔斯坦徘徊到了她身后，他突然的一句话把迪伦吓了一跳，手上的文胸也掉在了石地板上。他弯腰把它拾起来，却被她一把夺了过去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We need to get your clothes out of the water or they won't dry in time," he said. Dylan pulled her arm back quickly and dropped it in her lap. She stared down at her knees as her cheeks burned and her stomach twisted. Tristan saw the embarrassment and rejection on her face and felt a stab of regret. He opened his mouth to say something comforting, but Dylan had already spun away and hurried over to the sink, hiding her humiliation by pounding the dirt viciously out of her clothes. Thankful to have a task that would keep her eyes away from him, she took her time wringing every drop of water out of each item.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们得把你的衣服从水里捞出来了，不然它们一时半会儿干不了。”他说。迪伦很快把胳膊收了回来，垂在大腿上。她低头看着自己的膝盖，面庞发烫，心中痛楚。崔斯坦看出了她的尴尬和遭到拒绝的痛苦，感到一阵后悔。他张嘴想说一些安慰的话，但迪伦已经跑开绕到水槽那里去了。她奋力搓洗着衣服上的污渍，以此掩饰内心的耻辱感。幸亏手里的活可以让她的眼睛从他身上移开，于是她慢吞吞地拧着衣服，好像要把每一滴水都拧干一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was one final consideration, and it was a clincher. He could not follow where she was going. He would have to leave her at the border, or, more correctly, she would have to leave him. If she did feel for him, then to give now what he would soon have to take away was cruel. He would not put her through that. He must not act on what he felt. He looked at her, saw her watching him with those green eyes, dark as the forest, and felt his throat constrict. He was her guide and protector. Nothing more. Still, he could comfort her. That much he could allow himself. He smiled at her and held out his arms.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，他们还必须面对一个重要事实—他不可能跟她一起去目的地。他必须把她独自留在荒原与地狱的交界处，或者更准确地说，是她将不得不离开他。如果她对自己确实有好感，那么现在给予她那种很快又会收回的东西无疑是残忍的。他不愿她经历这种残忍，他不能感情用事。他看着她，发现她的一双碧眼也在看着自己，那双眼现在如森林一样黯淡幽深，他感到喉咙发紧。他只是她的向导和保护者，除此无他。不过，他还可以安慰她，他允许自己做的也就是这么多了。他冲着她笑笑，伸出了胳膊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In fact, he was fighting with his conscience. Dylan was only a child, compared to him little more than a baby, really. The feelings he had for her were inappropriate, wrong. As her protector, he would be taking advantage of her vulnerability if he acted on them. But was he so much older when he lived in a world where he never experienced, never grew? And what was age to a soul that would think and feel for eternity?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="实际上，他正在跟自己的良心缠斗。迪伦还是个孩子，跟他比起来真的不过是个婴儿而已，他对她产生的感情是不正常的、错误的。身为她的保护人，如果他由着自己的感情来，那就是在利用她的脆弱占便宜。但他生活在这个世界中，却从未体验过什么，从未长大过，他的年纪真的有那么大吗？而对于一个思考和感知保持永恒状态的灵魂来说，年龄又算什么呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was sure she had feelings for him, he thought he read it in her eyes. But he could be wrong. The care she showed for him could be nothing more than fear of being alone. The trust she put in him could be merely borne out of necessity -- for what other choice did she have? Her need to be close to him, the way she wanted to touch him, could be nothing more than the comfort a child yearns for from an adult when they are afraid. But he could not be sure.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他确信她对自己也是有好感的，他觉得这是自己从她的眼神中读出来的。但他也可能会误判，她对他表现出的关切可能只是因为不愿承受孤身一人的恐惧。她对他的信任可能也只不过是出于无奈—她还有别的选择吗？她对他的亲近，她试图抚摸他时的样子，可能不过是像孩童害怕时向成年人寻求慰藉的那种感觉。但他也不能确定。">查看中文翻译</div>
