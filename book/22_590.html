<div class="line_en">I shrieked. I shrieked and shrieked. I struggled like a fiend. But the more I twisted, the tighter I was held. I saw Gentleman fall back in his seat and the coach start up and begin to turn. I saw Maud put her face to the window of cloudy glass. At sight of her eyes, I shrieked again.</div>

<div class="line_en">But the coach drove on, the wheels throwing up dust and gravel as the horse got up its speed; and the faster it went, the harder I think I fought. Now the other doctor came forward, to help Dr Christie. The woman in the apron came, too. They were trying to pull me closer to the house. I wouldn't let them.</div>

<div class="line_en">The coach was speeding, growing smaller. "They're getting away!" I cried. Then the woman got behind me and seized my waist. She had a grip on her like a man's.

<div class="line_en">Her mouth was close to my ear, her face behind me. I hardly knew what I was doing. All I knew was, she had me there, and Gentleman and Maud were escaping. I felt her speak, bent my head forward, then took it sharply back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她嘴巴就贴着我耳朵，她的脸就在我身后。我都不知道自己在干什么。我心里就知道，她把我按在那儿，绅士和莫德正在跑路。我觉察到她在讲话，我脑袋先弯到前面，再猛地甩到后面。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The woman grabbed me again -- about the throat, this time; and as I turned in her arms she hit me hard, with the points of her fingers, in my stomach.

<div class="line_cn" title="那个女人又钳住我——这回是钳住我喉咙；当我在她怀里扭动挣扎时，她用指尖狠狠地戳到我的胃上。我想她这么做，医生都没看到。我身子一僵，猛吸了一口气。然后她再来一下。“就这儿！”她说道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Meanwhile, they had got me into the hall of the house and the sound of the whistle had brought another two men. They were pulling on brown paper cuffs over their coat-sleeves. They did not look like doctors. They came and caught hold of my ankles.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Hold her tight," said Dr Christie. He had brought out a thing like a great flat spoon, made of horn. He came to my side and held my head, and put the spoon to my mouth, between my teeth. It was smooth, but he pushed it hard and it hurt me. I thought I should be choked: I bit it, to keep it from going down my throat. It tasted bad. I still think of all the other people's mouths it must have gone in, before mine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“抓紧她，”克里斯蒂医生说道。他拿出一个又大又平的板条，牛角做的，像把勺子一样。他走到我身边，捏住我下巴，把那个板条放进我嘴里，压住我的舌头。那板条很光滑，可是他使劲压着我的舌头，那玩意弄得我很痛。我觉得我要上不来气了：我咬住那个板条，不让它进我的喉咙。那玩意味道特不好。我还想到，在我之前，这玩意光顾过的别人的嘴巴。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Keep her steady," said Dr Graves. "She's in a convulsion. She may put out her joints."</div>

<div class="line_en">I was not thinking, now, of Gentleman and Maud. I was thinking of myself. I was growing horribly afraid. My stomach ached from the nurse's fingers. My mouth was cut by the spoon. I had an idea that, once they got me into a room, they would kill me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这会儿我再没去想绅士和莫德了，我在想我自个儿。我渐渐变得非常恐惧。我的胃在护士指尖下依旧疼痛不止。我的嘴被那板条塞住。等他们把我抬进一个房间，我心里冒出一个念头，他们要杀了我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"A thrasher, ain't she?" said one of the men, as he worked for a better grip on my ankle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其中一位男子奋力抓着我的脚脖子，他说道，“她个鸟人。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“一个非常糟糕的病例，”克里斯蒂医生说道。他审视着我的脸。“癫狂终于要过去了。”他提高了声音。“别害怕，瑞富斯太太！我们对你的情况了如指掌。我们是你的朋友。我们带你来这里，是为了让你好起来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I tried to speak. "Help! Help!" I tried to say. But the spoon made me gobble like a bird. It also made me dribble; and a bit of dribble flew out of my mouth and struck Dr Christie's cheek. Perhaps he thought I had spat it. Anyway, he moved quickly back, and his face grew grim. He took out his handkerchief.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我努力想说话。我想说“救命！救命！”，可那板条令我咕噜咕噜地像只鸟儿。那玩意还让我流口水；一串口水从我嘴里飞出来，飞到克里斯蒂医生脸上。他或许以为是我啐了他。反正，他迅速退后，面孔也变得冷酷无情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That was the woman that held me by the throat. I saw her nod to him, and then to the men in the cuffs, and they turned so that they might walk with me, further into the house. I felt them do it and began to struggle again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他问的正是卡住我咽喉的那个女人，我看到她先跟他点点头，又跟带袖套的两个男子点点头，于是他们俩转过身去，要抬着我往病院深处行进。我察觉到他们要如此，便又开始挣扎。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Finally, one of the men began to whistle a tune, and to beat out the time of it, with his finger-ends, on my leg. Then we reached another room, with a ceiling of a paler shade of drab; and here they stopped.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他们抬着我径直穿过一条走廊，穿过一连串房门和一个房间；然后到了一个平台，走上另一条走廊，另一个房间——我想记下路线，可他们将我面朝上抬着：我只看得到一连串浅褐色的天花板和墙壁。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Very good," he said to the men and the nurse, as he wiped his cheek. "That will do. Now you may take her."</div>

<div class="line_en">After about a minute I knew they had got me deep into the house, and that I was lost. I could not cry out. The nurse kept her arm about my throat, and I still had the spoon of horn in my mouth. When we reached a staircase they took me down it, saying, "To you, Mr Bates," and, "Watch this turn, it's a tight one!" -- as if I might be, not a sack of feathers now, but a trunk or a piano. Not once did they look me in the face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过了一分钟，我知道他们已将我抬到屋子深处，我迷了路。我也没法子喊出声来。护士的胳膊一直钳着我的喉咙，那片牛角板条还在我嘴里。等我们到了楼梯口，他们抬着我走下楼梯，嘴里还说着，“说你呢，贝特斯先生，”还有，“当心这个弯儿，这弯儿拐得很急！”——此刻，仿佛我不再是一包鸡毛，而是一个大皮箱或一架钢琴。他们看也不看我的脸。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The men put down my legs. The woman took her arm from my neck and gave me a push. It was only a little push and yet, they had so pulled and shaken me about, I found I staggered and fell. I fell upon my hands. I opened my mouth and the spoon fell out. One of the men reached, quick, to take it. He shook the spit from it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两个男子放下我的腿。那女人放开钳着我脖子的胳膊，还推了我一把。虽说只是轻轻一推，可他们先前一直撕扯着我，摇晃着我，我感觉脚步踉跄，不由跌倒在地。我双手支撑着身子，嘴巴张开了，那板条也掉落出来。其中一个男子迅速伸过手，捡起那玩意儿，甩掉上面的口水。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And she drew back her hand and curled her fingers into a fist, and she hit me. I had grown up in the Borough, surrounded by every kind of desperate dodger and thief; but I had had Mrs Sucksby for a mother, and had never been hit. The blow knocked me almost out of my head. I put my hands to my face, and lay down in a crouch; but she got the gown off me anyway -- I suppose she was used to getting gowns off lunatics, and had a trick for it; and next she got hold of my corset and took that. Then she took my garters, and then my shoes and stockings, and finally my hair-pins.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她收回手，握成拳头，给了我一拳。我是在镇子上长大的，身边围着各种各样铤而走险的骗子和小偷；可我有萨克丝贝太太，像我母亲一样，我还从来没挨过打呢。那一拳打得我元神飞出脑壳。我双手捂着脸，倒在地上，蜷起身体；可她就把我的衣裳剥下来——我猜她经常剥疯子们的衣裳，已经摸到其中窍门了；接下来她抓住我的胸衣，也剥下来了。然后她脱了我的吊袜带，然后是鞋和袜子，最后是我的发卡。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She said all that, and she made a bundle of my clothes and swung them over her shoulder; and then she left me. The men went with her. They had seen her hit me, and done nothing.

Nurse Spiller closed the door and locked it, and the whistling grew very much fainter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她说了这番话，将我的衣裳卷成一卷，甩在肩膀上；然后就走了。两个男子跟她一道走了。他们都看到她打我，却袖手旁观。他们也眼见她脱掉我的袜子和胸衣。我听到他们拽掉纸袖套。其中一个又开始吹口哨。斯皮乐护士关了房门，上了锁，口哨声变得越来越模糊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When it had grown so faint I could no longer hear it, I got to my feet. Then I fell down again. My legs had been pulled so hard they shook like things of rubber, and my head was ringing, from the punch. My hands were trembling. I was, not to put too fine a point on it, properly funked. I went, on my knees, to the door, to look at the key-hole. There was no handle. The door itself was covered in a dirty canvas, padded with straw; the walls were covered in padded canvas, too. The floor had oil-cloth on it. There was a single blanket, very much torn and stained. There was a little tin pot I was meant to piddle in. There was a window, high up, with bars on. Beyond the bars were curling leaves of ivy. The light came in green and dark, like the water in a pond.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等到口哨声模糊到耳不可闻时，我便站起身来。随后我又颓然倒地。我的腿被他们扯的太狠，直发抖，象是橡皮做的，我脑壳里也为那一拳而丁冬作响。我的双手不住颤抖。我当时，坦率地说吧，完全吓坏了。我杵着膝盖爬到门边，想凑到钥匙孔上察看一番。门上没有把手。门板上包着脏兮兮的帆布，里面垫着麦草。四周墙壁也包着麦草和帆布。地板上过蜡。房里只有一条毯子，非常非常破，非常非常脏。还有一个小铁皮罐，给我小便用的。有一扇窗户，高高在上，钉着铁条。铁条外边是卷曲的爬山虎叶子。照进来的光线变得又绿又暗，就好象池塘里的水。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then I turned back to the door and put my fingers to it -- to the key-hole, to the canvas, to the edge, anywhere -- to try and pull it. But it was tight as a clam -- and, what was worse, as I stood plucking at it I began to make out little dints and tears in the dirty canvas -- little crescents, where the weave was worn -- that I understood all at once must be the marks left by the finger-nails of all the other lunatics -- all the real lunatics, I mean -- who had been put in that room before me.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="于是，后来我又去弄四周的墙壁。墙都很厚实。等我放弃了敲打和喊叫，我把毯子和小铁皮罐放在一块儿，斜靠着墙，放在窗户下面，我站到上面，想跳起来摸到窗玻璃；可那个小铁皮罐给我踩瘪了，毯子打了滑，我就摔下来了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At last I sat on the oil-cloth floor and cried. I cried, and my own tears stung me. I put my finger-tips to my cheek and felt about my swelling face. I felt my hair. The woman had pulled it to take the pins out, and it lay all about my shoulders; and when I took up a length of it, meaning to comb it, some of it came away in my hands. That made me cry worse than ever. I don't say I was much of a beauty; but I thought of a girl I knew, who had lost her hair to a wheel in a workshop -- that hair had never grown back. Suppose I should be bald? I went over my head, taking out the hair that was loose, wondering if I ought to keep it, perhaps for making a wig with later; but there was not much of it, after all. In the end I rolled it up and put it in a corner.</div>

<div class="line_en">And as I did that, I saw something, pale upon the floor. It looked like a crumpled white hand, and it gave me a start, at first; then I saw what it was. It had fallen out of my bosom when the nurse had got the gown off me, and been kicked out of sight. There was the mark of a shoe upon it, and one of its buttons was crushed. It was that glove of Maud's, that I had taken that morning from her things and meant to hold on to, as a keepsake of her.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then I walked faster, to be nearer Nurse Bacon. She led us to the dining-room. They were ringing a bell there, and as we went our line was joined by other nurses, with ladies from the rooms they watched in. I should say there were sixty or so ladies kept in that house; and they seemed to me now, after my spell in the pads, a vast and horrible crowd. They were dressed as I was -- I mean badly, in all sorts of fashions; and this -- and the fact that some had had their hair cut to their heads; and some had lost teeth, or had their teeth taken from them; and some had cuts and bruises, and others wore canvas bracelets or muffs -- this made them look queerer than perhaps they really were. I'm not saying they weren't all mad, in their own fashions; and to me, just then, they looked mad as horse-flies. But there are as many different ways of being mad, after all, as there are of being crooked. Some were perfect maniacs. Two or three, like Betty, were only simpletons. One liked to shout bad words. Another threw fits. The rest were only miserable: they walked, with their eyes on the floor, and sat and turned their hands in their laps, and mumbled, and sighed.</div>

<div class="line_en">I sat among them, and ate the dinner I was served. It was soup, as Miss Wilson had said, and I saw her looking at me, nodding her head, as I supped it; but I would not catch her eye. I would not catch anyone's eye. I had been drugged and stupid, before; now I was back in a sort of fright -- a sort of fever of fright -- sweating, and twitching, and wild. I looked at the doors and windows -- I think, if I had seen a window of plain glass, I should have run through it. But the windows all had bars on. I don't know what we should have done in a fire. The doors had ordinary locks, and with the right sort of tools I suppose I might have picked them. But I hadn't any kind of tool -- not so much as a hair-pin -- and nothing to make one with. The spoons we ate our soup with were made of tin, and so soft, they might have been rubber. You could not have picked your nose with them.</div>

There were many trees there, some of them close to the great park wall. I made a note of that. I had never climbed a tree in my life, but how hard could it be?

<div class="line_cn" title="“二十二年，”培根护士还在听我们说话。“因为你的确是个老病号——不是吗？——从我年轻的时候，刚来到这儿，你就是老病号了。有十四年了，到今年秋天。——啊，使点劲儿，贝蒂，就那儿！好姑娘。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"That is hard for you," said Miss Wilson, shaking her head and sighing. "That is the worst of all."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这可真难为你了。”威尔森小姐摇摇头，叹道。“这是最倒霉的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The man," I said, "that has put me here, is a dreadful villain; and only pretends to be my husband."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我摸到她的胳膊。我沉下去的心，此时像小船似的又浮起来了——如此有力，让我异常疼痛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Don't make anything of that," she said, in a comfortable voice. "Miss Wilson believes all sorts of nonsense. Only ask her, now, what creatures live in the moon."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可别当真啊，”她说道，话音舒适自在。“威尔森小姐相信一切无稽之谈。现在只需要问问她，月亮上住着什么人（creatures）。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You believe it," I said. I looked at Nurse Bacon; but she had heard me and opened her eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你相信我的话，”我说道。我看看培根护士；而她已睁开眼睛，正听我说话呢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Curse you!" said Miss Wilson. "I told you that as a confidence! -- You may see, Mrs Rivers, how they work to diminish my standing. -- Does my brother pay a guinea a week for you to abuse me? Thieves! Devils!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我咒你！”威尔森小姐说道。“我是当私房话讲给你听的！——你看到吧，他们如何损毁我的心志。——我兄弟是不是一周付你们一个几尼，专让你们辱骂我诽谤我？都是小偷！都是恶魔！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Nurse Bacon made a show of rising from her chair and making her hands into fists; and Miss Wilson grew quiet again. I said, after a moment, "You may think what you like about the moon, Miss Wilson. Why shouldn't you? But when I tell you I have been put in here by swindlers and am perfectly right in my head, I say no more than the truth. Dr Christie shall find it out, in time."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="培根护士站起身，两手捏成拳头，作势要打，威尔森小姐却又默不作声了。过了一会儿，我说道，“威尔森小姐，关于月亮，你喜欢怎么想，就怎么想。凭什么你不能那么想呢？不过，当我跟你说我是被骗子骗到这里，我说我脑袋里神志非常清楚时，我说的全是真话。克里斯蒂医生会发现这一点的，很快。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I stared at her. Then I looked at Nurse Bacon. "Is that true?" I asked. Nurse Bacon nodded. I began to weep again. "Then, God help me, I'm done for!" I cried. "For that shyster never, never will!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我瞪着她。然后我又看看培根护士。“是真的吗？”我问道。培根护士点点头。我又开始哭。“那么，上帝救救我吧，我完蛋了！”我哭道。“因为那个混蛋永远永远也不会签字！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Miss Wilson shook her head. "So hard! So hard! But perhaps he will visit, and take a change of heart? They must let us see our visitors, you know; that is the law."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="威尔森小姐摇摇头。“很难！很难！不过，说不定他会来探视，就改了主意呢？他们必须让我们会见我们的探视者，你知道；这是法律。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So then we all fell silent. Betty worked the grease in for another minute or two, then put the jar away and went back to her bed. Miss Wilson bent her head and her gaze grew dark. Mrs Price now and then let out a murmur or a moan from behind her veil of hair.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，我们都陷入静默。贝蒂抹油膏，又忙了一两分钟，然后将罐子放在一边，回到床上去了。威尔森小姐弓着脖子，目光变得暗淡。皮瑞斯太太头发盖在脸上，时不时从头发后面发出嘟囔声或呻吟。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I got to my feet and walked from one wall of the room to the other, and back. "If only there was a window!" I said. "If only we might see out." And then: "If only I had never left the Borough!"</div>

<div class="line_en">Then she cursed. There had come a knocking at the door, and she must get up from her chair to answer it. It was another nurse, with a paper. I waited until their heads were close together, then stole back to Miss Wilson. Desperation was beginning to make me sly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后她口吐怨言。房门上传来敲门声，她必须从椅子上站起来去应门。来者是另一个护士，拿着一张纸。我等到他俩的脑袋挨到一块儿了，才偷偷摸摸凑到威尔森小姐身边。绝望开始令我鬼鬼祟祟。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">From the room next door there came a burst of ragged shrieking. I thought of Mr Ibbs's sister. I thought of all my home, and all the people in it. I began, again, to sweat. I felt suddenly I think as a fly must feel, when wrapped in the thread of a spider.</div>

<div class="line_en">I supposed she guessed I had been trying to escape. I went back to my bed. She stood at the door with the other nurse, and said something to her in a murmur. The other nurse wrinkled her nose. Then they looked me over in the same cool, nasty way that I had seen other nurses look at me, before. I was still too ignorant then, of course, to know what the nasty look meant. God help me, though! -- for I was to find out, soon enough.</div>
