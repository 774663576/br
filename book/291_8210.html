<div class="line_en">"Drown!" answered Pinocchio from afar, happy at his escape.</div>

<div class="line_en">During that wild chase, Pinocchio lived through a terrible moment when he almost gave himself up as lost. This was when Alidoro (that was the Mastiff's name), in a frenzy of running, came so near that he was on the very point of reaching him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这场你死我活的赛跑，已经到了千钧一发的时刻，皮诺乔心想，这回准定要输了，因为要知道，阿利多罗（就是那条猛犬的名字）使劲地跑啊，跑啊，差不多就要追上他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Marionette heard, close behind him, the labored breathing of the beast who was fast on his trail, and now and again even felt his hot breath blow over him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="只说一点就够了：木偶已经听到这条恶犬在他身后一巴掌远的地方很急促的喘气声，甚至感觉到了它呼吸的热气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As soon as he set foot on the beach, Pinocchio gave a leap and fell into the water. Alidoro tried to stop, but as he was running very fast, he couldn't, and he, too, landed far out in the sea. Strange though it may seem, the Dog could not swim. He beat the water with his paws to hold himself up, but the harder he tried, the deeper he sank. As he stuck his head out once more, the poor fellow's eyes were bulging and he barked out wildly, "I drown! I drown!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="木偶一到海边，就像小青蛙似的，很利落地扑通一声，跳到了水里。阿利多罗正好相反，想马上停住脚步，可跑得太快了，脚步收不住，跟着也扑通一声落到了水里。这只倒霉的狗不会游泳，因此两条脚马上乱划，想要浮在水面。可它越划越往下沉，连头都沉到水底下去了。等到这条可怜的狗把头伸出来，它吓得两眼瞪大，汪汪叫着说：“我要淹死了！我要淹死了！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Pinocchio hesitated still another minute. Then, remembering how his father had often told him that a kind deed is never lost, he swam to Alidoro and, catching hold of his tail, dragged him to the shore.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮诺乔先还犹豫了一下，可终于记起他爸爸一再说过的话，做好事永远不吃亏，就游到阿利多罗身边，伸出两手，一把抓住了它的尾巴，把它活生生拉上干燥的沙滩。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At those cries of suffering, the Marionette, who after all had a very kind heart, was moved to compassion. He turned toward the poor animal and said to him:</div>

<div class="line_en">His mind made up, Pinocchio swam to the rocks, but as he started to climb, he felt something under him lifting him up higher and higher. He tried to escape, but he was too late. To his great surprise, he found himself in a huge net, amid a crowd of fish of all kinds and sizes, who were fighting and struggling desperately to free themselves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他拿定了主意，就向礁石游过去。可他到了那里正要上岸，忽然觉得水底下有样东西升起来，升啊，升啊，把他一直托到空中，他马上打算逃走，可已经来不及了，因为使他惊奇万分的是，他竟在一个大鱼网里，夹在一大堆鱼中间。这些鱼形形色色，有大有小，正拼了命啪哒啪哒摇着尾巴挣扎。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Pinocchio went on swimming close to shore. At last he thought he had reached a safe place. Glancing up and down the beach, he saw the opening of a cave out of which rose a spiral of smoke.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮诺乔继续紧靠着岸边游。最后他觉得已经到了安全的地方，朝岸上看看，看见礁石上有个山洞，山洞里冒出烟来，飘得高高的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At the same time, he saw a Fisherman come out of the cave, a Fisherman so ugly that Pinocchio thought he was a sea monster. In place of hair, his head was covered by a thick bush of green grass. Green was the skin of his body, green were his eyes, green was the long, long beard that reached down to his feet. He looked like a giant lizard with legs and arms.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正在这时候，他看见山洞里走出一个渔夫，样子太难看了，难看得简直像个海怪。他的头发不是头发，是一大蓬绿草。他身上的皮肤是绿的，眼睛是绿的，胡子老长老长，一直垂到脚上，也是绿的。他活像一条用后脚直立的绿色大晰蜴。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我来看看捉到了什么鱼！”绿莹莹的渔夫说着，把烘炉铲子似的一只大手伸进鱼网，抓出一把火鱼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Fisherman took the net and the fish to the cave, a dark, gloomy, smoky place. In the middle of it, a pan full of oil sizzled over a smoky fire, sending out a repelling odor of tallow that took away one's breath.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then he pulled a wooden bowl full of flour out of a cupboard and started to roll the fish into it, one by one. When they were white with it, he threw them into the pan.
