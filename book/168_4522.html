<div class="line_en">The maester who cared for him was a young man, thankfully. After the old knight had drifted to sleep in his chair, he took them aside and said, "I fear you seek a ghost. We had a bird, ages ago, half a year at least. The Lannisters caught Lord Beric near the Gods Eye. He was hanged."</div>

<div class="line_en">"You'd know for certain if there was a song," said Tom Sevenstrings. "One good song, and we'd know who Ser Maynard used to be and why he wanted to cross this bridge so bad.

<div class="line_en">Three days later, as they rode through a yellow wood, Jack-Be-Lucky unslung his hom and blew a signal, a different one than before. The sounds had scarcely died away when rope ladders unrolled from the limbs of trees. "Hobble the horses and up we go," said Tom, half singing the words. They climbed to a hidden village in the upper branches, a maze of rope walkways and little moss-covered houses concealed behind walls of red and gold, and were taken to the Lady of the Leaves, a stick-thin white-haired woman dressed in roughspun. "We cannot stay here much longer, with autumn on us," she told them. "A dozen wolves went down the Hayford road nine days past, hunting. If they'd chanced to look up they might have seen us."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="三天之后，他们骑过一株黄桑树，幸运杰克取下猎号，吹出一种独特的节奏。余音尚未消尽，树上便放下绳梯。“系好马儿呵，我们上去，”汤姆半唱半白地说。枝杈高处有座隐藏的村落，一座由绳索走道和青苔小屋构成的迷宫，房屋隐藏在红色和金色的树叶之墙后。他们被带到树叶夫人面前，她是个白发老妪，瘦得像竹竿，穿着粗布衣。“秋天了，不能再在这儿呆下去，”她告诉他们，“九天前，十来个狼仔沿着哈佛大道过来搜刮。如果他们抬头，也许就会发现我们。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The next night they found shelter beneath the scorched shell of a sept, in a burned village called Sallydance. Only shards remained of its windows of leaded glass, and the aged septon who greeted them said the looters had even made off with the Mother's costly robes, the Crone's gilded lantern, and the silver crown the Father had worn. "They hacked the Maiden's breasts off too, though those were only wood," he told them. "And the eyes, the eyes were jet and lapis and mother-of-pearl, they pried them out with their knives.

<div class="line_en">High Heart had been sacred to the children of the forest, Tom Sevenstrings told her, and some of their magic lingered here still. "No harm can ever come to those as sleep here," the singer said. Arya thought that must be true; the hill was so high and the surrounding lands so flat that no enemy could approach unseen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="七弦汤姆告诉她，高尚之心曾是森林之子的圣地，他们的魔法仍在此存留。“睡这儿的人不会受伤害，”歌手道。艾莉亚认为这是真的：这座山好高哦，周围土地又平坦，敌人决不可能悄悄接近。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That much was true, Arya knew. Knights were captured and ransomed all the time, and sometimes women were too. But what if Robb won't pay their price? She wasn't a famous knight, and kings were supposed to put the realm before their sisters. And her lady mother, what would she say? Would she still want her back, after all the things she'd done? Arya chewed her lip and wondered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这倒是，艾莉亚明白，古往今来，骑士被俘后就是用来交换赎金的，有些女士也可以。如果罗柏不愿付钱呢？她不能打仗，而国王理应将国家置于亲属之上。还有母亲大人，她会怎么说？我闯了这么多祸，母亲还要我吗？艾莉亚咬紧嘴唇寻思。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The next day they rode to a place called High Heart, a hill so lofty that from atop it Arya felt as though she could see half the world. Around its brow stood a ring of huge pale stumps, all that remained of a circle of once-mighty weirwoods. Arya and Gendry walked around the hill to count them. There were thirty-one, some so wide that she could have used them for a bed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天，他们骑到一个叫“高尚之心”的地方，那是一座高山，其顶蜂好似能看到半个世界。环绕顶峰的是一圈巨大苍白的树墩，原本都为高耸雄壮的鱼梁木。艾莉亚和詹德利围着山头边走边数，一共三十一个，有些大得她可以当床睡。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Yet even so, the hair on the back of her neck stood up that night. She had been asleep, but the storm woke her. The wind pulled the coverlet right off her and sent it swirling into the bushes. When she went after it she heard voices.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="即便如此，入夜之后，她仍旧觉得毛骨悚然。好容易睡着，一阵突来的风雨又将她惊醒，被单被一下子掀掉，旋转着飞入灌木丛中。她追赶过去时，听到了说话声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The smallfolk hereabouts shunned the place, Tom told her; it was said to be haunted by the ghosts of the children of the forest who had died here when the Andal king named Erreg the Kinslayer had cut down their grove. Arya knew about the children of the forest, and about the Andals too, but ghosts did not frighten her. She used to hide in the crypts of Winterfell when she was little, and play games of come-into-my-castle and monsters and maidens amongst the stone kings on their thrones.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汤姆续道，附近百姓都回避此处，因为传说有森林之子的鬼魂出没。当年安达尔人的国王“弑亲者”艾瑞格砍倒树林，杀死了他们，他们一直没得到安息。艾莉亚却不怕，她从小就听说森林之子和安达尔人的故事，自己还当过赫伦堡的鬼魂呢。就小时候吧，她也曾躲进临冬城的墓窖，在王座上的国王石像间玩城堡游戏，玩美女与怪兽。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Beside the embers of their campfire, she saw Tom, Lem, and Greenbeard talking to a tiny little woman, a foot shorter than Arya and older than Old Nan, all stooped and wrinkled and leaning on a gnarled black cane. Her white hair was so long it came almost to the ground. When the wind gusted it blew about her head in a fine cloud. Her flesh was whiter, the color of milk, and it seemed to Arya that her eyes were red, though it was hard to tell from thebushes. "The old gods stir and will not let me sleep," she heard the woman say. "I dreamt I saw a shadow with a burning heart butchering a golden stag, aye. I dreamt of a man without a face, waiting on a bridge that swayed and swung. On his shoulder perched a drowned crow with seaweed hanging from his wings. I dreamt of a roaring river and a woman that was a fish. Dead she drifted, with red tears on her cheeks, but when her eyes did open, oh, I woke from terror. All this I dreamt, and more. Do you have gifts for me, to pay me for my dreams?"</div>

"I wouldn't call it hiding, milady, but it's true, Lord Beric moves about a lot, and seldom lets on what his plans are. That way no one can betray him. By now there must be hundreds of us sworn to him, maybe thousands, but it wouldn't do for us all to trail along behind him. We'd eat the country bare, or get butchered in a battle by some bigger host. The way we're scattered in little bands, we can strike in a dozen places at once, and be off somewhere else before they know.

I've heard his lordship say this war began when the Hand sent him out to bring the king's justice to Gregor Clegane, and that's how he means for it to end." He gave her shoulder a reassuring pat.

She told them about the village by the Gods Eye where she and Gendry had been caught, and the questions that the Tickler had asked. "Is there gold hidden in the village?" he would always begin. "Silver, gems? Is there food? Where is Lord Beric? Which of you village folk helped him? Where did he go? How many men did he have with him? How many knights? How many bowmen? How many were horsed? How are they armed? How many wounded? Where did they go, did you say?" just thinking of it, she could hear the shrieks again, and smell the stench of blood and shit and burning flesh.

<div class="line_en">It was a long day's ride, but as dusk was settling they forded a brook and came up on Acorn Hall, with its stone curtain walls and great oaken keep. Its master was away fighting in the retinue of his master, Lord Vance, the castle gates closed and barred in his absence. But his lady wife was an old friend of Tom Sevenstrings, and Anguy said they'd once been lovers. Anguy often rode beside her; he was closer to her in age than any of them but Gendry, and he told her droll tales of the Dornish Marches. He never fooled her, though. He's not my friend. He's only staying close to watch me and make sure I don't ride off again. Well, Arya could watch as well. Syrio Forel had taught her how.</div>

<div class="line_en">Lady Smallwood welcomed the outlaws kindly enough, though she gave them a tongue lashing for dragging a young girl through the war. She became even more wroth when Lem let slip that Arya was highborn. "Who dressed the poor child in those Bolton rags?" she demanded of them. "That badge… there's many a man who would hang her in half a heartbeat for wearing a flayed man on her breast." Arya promptly found herself marched upstairs, forced into a tub, and doused with scalding hot water. Lady Smallwood's maidservants scrubbed her so hard it felt like they were flaying her themselves. They even dumped in some stinkysweet stuff that smelled like flowers.</div>

He gave me a sweet piece of steel, and I knew just how I wanted to shape the blade. Only Yoren came, and took me away for the Night's Watch."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“但你高雅，很高雅，你是一棵高雅的橡树，”他走上前嗅嗅她，“连气味也变得高雅。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You don't. You stink." Arya shoved him back against the anvil and made to run, but Gendry caught her arm. She stuck a foot between his legs and tripped him, but he yanked her down with him, and they rolled across the floor of the smithy. He was very strong, but she was quicker. Every time he tried to hold her still she wriggled free and punched him. Gendry only laughed at the blows, which made her mad. He finally caught both her wrists in one hand and started to tickle her with the other, so Arya slammed her knee between his legs, and wrenched free. Both of them were covered in dirt, and one sleeve was tom. on her stupid acorn dress. "I bet I don't look so nice now," she shouted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你却不是。你臭烘烘的。”艾莉亚将他朝砧板推去，然后拔腿就跑，不料胳膊却被一把拽住。她踢他胯下，并把他绊倒，然而詹德利将她一起拽翻，两人在铁匠铺的地板上打闹翻滚。詹德利强壮，艾莉亚灵活，每次男孩想抓她，都被她扭动挣脱。她使劲打他，他却哈哈大笑，把她气坏了。最终，詹德利用一只手擒住她两个手腕，另一只手挠她痒痒，艾莉亚便顺势拿膝盖顶他胯下，再次挣脱。等她站起来，发现两人混身灰尘，而那笨乎乎的橡果裙有只袖子撕裂了。“我打赌，现在我看上去不那么高雅了，”她喊道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I have no gowns of leaves," said Lady Smallwood with a small fond smile, "but Carellen left some other dresses that might serve. Come, child, let us go upstairs and see what we can find."</div>

<div class="line_en">It was even worse than before; Lady Smallwood insisted that Arya take another bath, and cut and comb her hair besides; the dress she put her in this time was sort of lilac-colored, and decorated with little baby pearls. The only good thing about it was that it was so delicate that no one could expect her to ride in it. So the next morning as they broke their fast, Lady Smallwood gave her breeches, belt, and tunic to wear, and a brown doeskin jerkin dotted with iron studs. "They were my son's things," she said. "He died when he was seven."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这回比上回更糟；斯莫伍德坚持让艾莉亚再洗一遍澡，然后修剪梳理头发，换上的裙服乃是淡紫色，饰有细小珍珠。惟一的好处是，它如此精致，没有人认为她能穿这身衣服骑马。所以第二天早晨用餐时，斯莫伍德夫人给她拿来马裤、皮带和束腰短装，以及一件镶铁钉棕色鹿皮背心。“这是我儿子的，”她说，“他七岁时死了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
