<div class="line_en">Shawn worked long days cleaning, cutting and welding the raw materials for the granaries, and once construction began he was usually on-site in Malad. When he and Dad came home, hours after sunset, they were nearly always cussing. Shawn wanted to professionalize the operation, to invest the profits from the Malad job in new equipment; Dad wanted things to stay the same. Shawn said Dad didn't understand that construction was more competitive than scrapping, and that if they wanted to land real contracts, they needed to spend real money on real equipment -- specifically, a new welder and a man lift with a basket.</div>

<div class="line_en">Every evening, as the crew was leaving Malad, Dad would phone the house so Mother could have dinner waiting when the truck bumped up the hill. I listened for that call, and when it came I would get in Mother's car and drive away. I didn't know why. I would go to Worm Creek, where I'd sit in the balcony and watch rehearsals, my feet on the ledge, a math book open in front of me. I hadn't studied math since long division, and the concepts were unfamiliar. I understood the theory of fractions but struggled to manipulate them, and seeing a decimal on the page made my heart race. Every night for a month I sat in the opera house, in a chair of red velvet, and practiced the most basic operations -- how to multiply fractions, how to use a reciprocal, how to add and multiply and divide with decimals -- while on the stage, characters recited their lines.</div>

<div class="line_en">The misery began when I moved beyond the Pythagorean theorem to sine, cosine and tangent. I couldn't grasp such abstractions. I could feel the logic in them, could sense their power to bestow order and symmetry, but I couldn't unlock it. They kept their secrets, becoming a kind of gateway beyond which I believed there was a world of law and reason. But I could not pass through the gate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我从勾股定理转向学习正弦、余弦和正切时，痛苦开始了。我无法理解如此抽象的概念。我能感知其中的逻辑，能感觉到它们赋予秩序和对称的力量，但我无法限免其中的奥秘。它们严守秘密，成为一扇大门。我相信这扇门外是一个规则而理性的世界，但是我无法通过那扇门。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I began to study trigonometry. There was solace in its strange formulas and equations. I was drawn to the Pythagorean theorem and its promise of a universal -- the ability to predict the nature of any three points containing a right angle, anywhere, always. What I knew of physics I had learned in the junkyard, where the physical world often seemed unstable, capricious. But here was a principle through which the dimensions of life could be defined, captured. Perhaps reality was not wholly volatile. Perhaps it could be explained, predicted. Perhaps it could be made to make sense.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我开始学习三角学。奇怪的公式和方程让人安心。我被勾股定理及其通用性深深吸引——它始终能预测任意一个直角三角形三边的关系。我对物理的认知全部来自废料场，那里的物质世界似乎极不稳定、反复无常。但有一个原理可以定义和捕捉生命的维度。也许现实并非完全变化无常。也许它能被解释和预测。也许它能用常理理解。">查看中文翻译</div>

He'd said a lot more, of course, about how I was whoring after man's knowledge instead of God's, but still I decided to ask him about trigonometry. Here was a sliver of man's knowledge I was certain he possessed.</div>

<div class="line_en">I've heard conflicting accounts of why Shawn fell. Someone said Dad moved the boom unexpectedly and Shawn pitched over the edge. But the general consensus is that Shawn was standing near the brink, and for no reason at all stepped backward and lost his footing. He plunged twelve feet, his body revolving slowly in the air, so that when he struck the concrete wall with its outcropping of rebar, he hit headfirst, then tumbled the last eight feet to the dirt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="关于肖恩坠落的原因我听过互相矛盾的说法。有人说爸爸意外地移动了吊杆，肖恩从边缘仰面摔了下去。但普遍的共识是肖恩站在托盘边缘，不知为何后退一步，失足了。他的身体在空中慢慢旋转，往下跌落了十二英尺，于是当他碰到钢筋裸露的混凝土墙时，头先撞了一下，然后继续下落八英尺才摔到地上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The story I heard was that fifteen minutes later Shawn wandered onto the site. Dad thought he was ready to work and told him to climb onto the pallet, and Shawn, who never liked being told what to do, started screaming at Dad about everything -- the equipment, the granary designs, his pay. He screamed himself hoarse, then just when Dad thought he had calmed down, he gripped Dad around the waist and flung him like a sack of grain. Before Dad could scramble to his feet Shawn took off, leaping and howling and laughing, and Luke and Benjamin, now sure something was very wrong, chased after him. Luke reached him first but couldn't hold him; then Benjamin added his weight and Shawn slowed a little. But it wasn't until all three men tackled him -- throwing his body to the ground, where, because he was resisting, his head hit hard -- that he finally lay still.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我听到的版本是十五分钟后肖恩又漫步回到了工地。爸爸以为他准备好继续工作了，便让他爬上托盘，而从不喜欢别人指手画脚的肖恩开始针对周围的一切朝爸爸尖叫——从设备，到仓库设计，再到他的工资。他喊得嗓子都哑了，就在爸爸以为他已经平静下来时，他一把抱住爸爸的腰，像扔一袋粮食一样把他扔了出去。爸爸还没来得及爬起来，肖恩就跑了，边跑边咆哮和大笑。卢克和本杰明这才意识到事情有点儿不对头，于是追了上去。卢克先追上他，但逮不住他；后来加上本杰明的力量，肖恩才稍微放慢了速度。直到三个男人一起抓住他——将他放倒在地，由于他一味反抗，头部又重重碰了一下——他才终于一动不动了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">No one has ever described to me what happened when Shawn's head struck that second time. Whether he had a seizure, or vomited, or lost consciousness, I'm not sure. But it was so chilling that someone -- maybe Dad, probably Benjamin -- dialed 911, which no member of my family had ever done before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没人向我描述过肖恩头部第二次被撞时发生了什么。我不确定他是否癫痫发作，呕吐，或是失去了知觉。但令人寒心的是，有人——也许是爸爸，很可能是本杰明——拨打了911，之前我的家人从没这么做过。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I struggle to imagine the scene while they waited for the chopper. Dad said that when the paramedics arrived, Shawn was sobbing, begging for Mother. By the time he reached the hospital, his state of mind had shifted. He stood naked on the gurney, eyes bulging, bloodshot, screaming that he would rip out the eyes of the next bastard who came near him. Then he collapsed into sobs and finally lost consciousness.</div>

<div class="line_en">He lived on the sofa in the front room for two months. He was physically weak -- it was all he had in him to make it to the bathroom and back. He'd lost his hearing completely in one ear and had trouble hearing with the other, so he often turned his head when people spoke to him, orienting his better ear toward them, rather than his eyes. Except for this strange movement and the bandages from the surgery, he looked normal, no swelling, no bruises. According to the doctors, this was because the damage was very serious: a lack of external injuries meant the damage was all internal.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他在起居室沙发上待了两个月。他身体仍然虚弱——去趟卫生间便能耗尽所有力气。他一只耳朵完全失聪，另一只耳朵听力受损，所以有人对他说话时，他常常把头转过来，将能听见的那只耳朵对准那人，而不是用眼睛看着对方。除了这个奇怪的举动和手术后的绷带，他看上去很正常，没有肿胀，也没有瘀青。根据医生的说法，这是因为受伤极为严重：外部未见损伤，意味着损伤都在内里。">查看中文翻译</div>

Mother thought it was important that I stay with Shawn, so no one interrupted me. For the first time in my life I had long stretches in which to learn -- without having to scrap, or strain tinctures, or check inventory for Randy. I examined Tyler's notes, read and reread his careful explanations. After a few weeks of this, by magic or miracle, the concepts took hold. I retook the practice test. The advanced algebra was still indecipherable -- it came from a world beyond my ability to perceive -- but the trigonometry had become intelligible, messages written in a language I could understand, from a world of logic and order that only existed in black ink and on white paper.</div>

<div class="line_en">He did succumb to rages, moments of blind anger when all he wanted was to hurt someone. He had an intuition for nastiness, for saying the single most devastating thing, that left Mother in tears more nights than not. These rages changed, and worsened, as his physical strength improved, and I found myself cleaning the toilet every morning, knowing my head might be inside it before lunch.
