<div class="line_en">"Her Grace does not wish to be disturbed," Ser Mandon repeated slowly, as if Tyrion were a dullard who had not heard him the first time.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the chilly white raiment of the Kingsguard, Ser Mandon Moore looked like a corpse in a shroud. "Her Grace left orders, the council in session is not to be disturbed."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="曼登·穆尔爵士一身御林铁卫的雪白制服，活像一具裹布的尸体。“太后有令：会议途中不得打扰。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jaime had once told him that Moore was the most dangerous of the Kingsguard -- excepting himself, always -- because his face gave no hint as what he might do next. Tyrion would have welcomed a hint. Bronn and Timett could likely kill the knight if it came to swords, but it would scarcely bode well if he began by slaying one of Joffrey's protectors. Yet if he let the man turn him away, where was his authority? He made himself smile. "Ser Mandon, you have not met my companions. This is Timett son of Timett, a red hand of the Burned Men. And this is Bronn. Perchance you recall Ser Vardis Egen, who was captain of Lord Arryn's household guard?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="詹姆曾说，御林铁卫中最危险的角色非穆尔莫属——当然，除了他自己——因为这家伙面无表情，谁也料不透他心中的打算。提利昂此刻真想从他脸上看出一点端倪。倘若真要刀剑相向，此人当然不是波隆和提魅的对手，但刚一上任就宰了乔佛里的护卫，以后怎么得了？但话说回来，假如就这么让他得逞，自己还有何权威可言？于是他逼自己露出微笑。“曼登爵士，我想您一定还没见过我的伙伴。这位是提魅之子提魅，他是明月山脉灼人部的‘红手’将军。这位则是波隆，您应该还记得艾林大人的侍卫队长瓦狄斯·伊根爵士吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A small victory, he thought, but sweet. He had passed his first test. Tyrion Lannister shouldered through the door, feeling almost tall.

<div class="line_en">Tyrion watched her read. His sister had taken the king's seat for herself -- he gathered Joffrey did not often trouble to attend council meetings, no more than Robert had -- so Tyrion climbed up into the Hand's chair. It seemed only appropriate.</div>

All that about the thunder of the drums, sunlight flashing on armor, magnificent destriers snorting and prancing? Well, the drums gave me headaches, the sunlight flashing on my armor cooked me up like a harvest day goose, and those magnificent destriers shit everywhere. Not that I am complaining. Compared to the hospitality I enjoyed in the Vale of Arryn, drums, horseshit, and fly bites are my favorite things."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他笑了，“不不不，我杀敌杀够了，还是敬谢不敏的好。坐椅子，总比骑马安稳得多，更何况我宁愿端酒杯，也不要拿战斧。不是都说战场上鼓声雷动，金甲夺目，马鸣萧萧吗？唉，战鼓敲得我头疼，穿盔甲都快被太阳烤焦，简直跟丰收宴会上的烤鹅没两样，至于马嘛，它们就知道四处拉屎！不过呢，我也不该抱怨，跟在艾林谷受到的盛情款待相比，鼓声、马粪和苍蝇已经没话说啦。”">查看中文翻译</div>

The streets of King's Landing had always been teeming and raucous and noisy, but now they reeked of danger in a way that he did not recall from past visits. A naked corpse sprawled in the gutter near the Street of Looms, being torn at by a pack of feral dogs, yet no one seemed to care. Watchmen were much in evidence, moving in pairs through the alleys in their gold cloaks and shirts of black ringmail, iron cudgels never far from their hands. The markets were crowded with ragged men selling their household goods for any price they could get… and conspicuously empty of farmers selling food. What little produce he did see was three times as costly as it had been a year ago. One peddler was hawking rats roasted on a skewer. "Fresh rats," he cried loudly, "fresh rats." Doubtless fresh rats were to be preferred to old stale rotten rats. The frightening thing was, the rats looked more appetizing than most of what the butchers were selling. On the Street of Flour, Tyrion saw guards at every other shop door. When times grew lean, even bakers found sellswords cheaper than bread, he reflected.</div>
