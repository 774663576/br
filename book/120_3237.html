<div class="line_en">The little man now spoke to the judge for the first time. "Sir," he said, "I must explain. I've done nothing wrong -- my only crime is that the prisoner is my brother. Today I was on my way to visit him in Casterbridge prison for the last time, when I got lost in the dark. I stopped here to ask the way, and when I opened the door, I saw my brother sitting by the fire. Right next to him was the hangman who'd come to take his life!
