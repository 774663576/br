<div class="line_en">Harry got up on Sunday morning and dressed so inattentively that it was a while before he realized he was trying to pull his hat onto his foot instead of his sock. When he'd finally got all his clothes on the right parts of his body, he hurried off to find Hermione, locating her at the Gryffindor table in the Great Hall, where she was eating breakfast with Ginny. Feeling too queasy to eat, Harry waited until Hermione had swallowed her last spoonful of porridge, then dragged her out onto the grounds. There, he told her all about the dragons, and about everything Sirius had said, while they took another long walk around the lake.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="星期日早晨，哈利一觉醒来，心不在焉地穿着衣服，过了一会儿他才意识到自己正把帽子当袜子往脚上套呢。他终于把每件衣服都穿在了合适的部位，便匆匆出来寻找赫敏，最后在礼堂里格兰芬多的桌子旁找到了她。赫敏正和金妮一起吃早饭呢。哈利觉得胃不舒服，吃不下东西，就在一旁等着。赫敏刚咽下最后一勺粥，他就拉着她来到外面的场地上。他们沿着湖边走了很长时间，他把火龙的事和小天狼星所说的话一股脑儿都告诉了赫敏。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They walked three times around the lake, trying all the way to think of a simple spell that would subdue a dragon. Nothing whatsoever occurred to them, so they retired to the library instead. Here, Harry pulled down every book he could find on dragons, and both of them set to work searching through the large pile.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们沿着湖边走了三圈，绞尽脑汁，苦苦思索着一个能降服火龙的简单咒语，结果一无所获，于是他们又退回到图书馆内。在这里，哈利把他所能找到的每一本跟龙有关的书都抽了出来，两人像大海捞针一样，开始在一大摞书中搜寻。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But all that happened, when Hermione fell silent, was that Harry's brain filled with a sort of blank buzzing, which didn't seem to allow room for concentration. He stared hopelessly down the index of Basic Hexes for the Busy and Vexed. Instant scalping… but dragons had no hair… pepper breath… that would probably increase a dragon's firepower… horn tongue… just what he needed, to give it an extra weapon…</div>

But as he looked around the Great Hall at breakfast time, and thought about what leaving the castle would mean, he knew he couldn't do it. It was the only place he had ever been happy… well, he supposed he must have been happy with his parents too, but he couldn't remember that.</div>

<div class="line_en">Somehow, the knowledge that he would rather be here and facing a dragon than back on Privet Drive with Dudley was good to know; it made him feel slightly calmer. He finished his bacon with difficulty (his throat wasn't working too well), and as he and Hermione got up, he saw Cedric Diggory leaving the Hufflepuff table.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不知怎的，想到自己宁愿待在这里面对火龙，也不愿回到女贞路去和德思礼一家相处，他觉得很宽慰，心情也平静了一些。他费力地咽下他那份熏咸肉（他的嗓子好像出了点儿毛病），然后和赫敏一起站起身来。就在这时，他看见塞德里克·迪戈里正准备离开赫奇帕奇桌子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">By the time Harry reached the bottom of the marble staircase, Cedric was at the top. He was with a load of sixth-year friends. Harry didn't want to talk to Cedric in front of them; they were among those who had been quoting Rita Skeeter's article at him every time he went near them. He followed Cedric at a distance and saw that he was heading toward the Charms corridor. This gave Harry an idea. Pausing at a distance from them, he pulled out his wand, and took careful aim.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当哈利来到大理石楼梯底部时，塞德里克已经和他那一大帮六年级同学们一起到了顶上。哈利不想当着那些人的面跟塞德里克说话。每次他走近他们时，都有人引用丽塔·斯基特文章里的话来嘲笑他，这些人也在其中。他远远地跟着塞德里克，看见他朝魔咒课教室的走廊走去。这使哈利有了主意。他远远地停下脚步，抽出魔杖，仔细地瞄准。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="塞德里克站直身子，怀里抱着一大堆沾染了墨水的羽毛笔、羊皮纸和书本，撕裂的书包从一个肩膀上耷拉了下来。他盯着哈利，眼睛里有一种困惑的、几乎可以说是怀疑的神情。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He had visited this office under two of its previous occupants. In Professor Lockhart's day, the walls had been plastered with beaming, winking pictures of Professor Lockhart himself. When Lupin had lived here, you were more likely to come across a specimen of some fascinating new Dark creature he had procured for them to study in class. Now, however, the office was full of a number of exceptionally odd objects that Harry supposed Moody had used in the days when he had been an Auror.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="办公室的前两位主人在的时候，哈利曾经来过这里。洛哈特教授在的那些日子，墙上贴满了洛哈特教授本人笑眯眯的眨着眼睛的照片。卢平在这里的时候，你经常会碰到一些十分奇妙和新鲜的黑魔法生物，那是卢平弄来让他们在课学堂上学习用的。现在，办公室里放着一大堆稀奇古怪的玩艺儿，哈利猜想这些都是穆迪当傲罗时用过的东西。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On his desk stood what looked hike a large, cracked, glass spinning top; Harry recognized it at once as a Sneakoscope, because he owned one himself, though it was much smaller than Moody's. In the corner on a small table stood an object that looked something like an extra-squiggly, golden television aerial. It was humming slightly. What appeared to be a mirror hung opposite Harry on the wall, but it was not reflecting the room. Shadowy figures were moving around inside it, none of them clearly in focus.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在穆迪的办公桌上，有一只像是裂了缝的玻璃大陀螺般的东西。哈利一眼就认出来了，这是一个窥镜，因为他自己也有一只，不过比穆迪的这只要小得多。在一张小桌子的角上，放着一个古怪的东西，看上去有点像金色的电视天线，不过扭曲得特别厉害，不停地发出轻轻的嗡嗡声。哈利对面的墙上挂着一面类似镜子的东西，但照出的不是房间里的情景，里面有许多黑乎乎的人影晃来晃去，却都模模糊糊，看不真切。">查看中文翻译</div>

Vibrates when it detects concealment and lies… no use here, of course, too much interference -- students in every direction lying about why they haven't done their homework.

Of course, it could be picking up more than kid stuff," he added in a growl.</div>

<div class="line_en">"That was excellent, Potter!" cried Professor McGonagall as he got off the Firebolt -- which from her was extravagant praise. He noticed that her hand shook as she pointed at his shoulder. "You'll need to see Madam Pomfrey before the judges give out your score… Over there, she's had to mop up Diggory already…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“真是太精彩了，波特！”他刚从火弩箭上下来，麦格教授就大声说——这话从她嘴里说出来，已经是很高的赞扬了。哈利注意到她指着他肩膀的手在微微颤抖。“在裁判打分前，你需要去找一下庞弗雷夫人…就在那儿，已经有迪戈里需要她照料…”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry saw the dragon keepers rushing forward to subdue the Horntail, and, over at the entrance to the enclosure, Professor McGonagall, Professor Moody, and Hagrid hurrying to meet him, all of them waving him toward them, their smiles evident even from this distance. He flew back over the stands, the noise of the crowd pounding his eardrums, and came in smoothly to land, his heart lighter than it had been in weeks… He had got through the first task, he had survived…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利看见驯龙者纷纷冲过去，平息树蜂的怒火。在场地的入口处那边，麦格教授、穆迪教授和海格匆匆走过来迎接他。他们都在朝他招手，要他过去，即使隔着这么远的距离，他们脸上的笑容也清晰可见。哈利飞回到看台上方，人群的喧哗声敲击着他的隔膜。他平稳地降落到地面，几个月来，心情第一次这么轻松…他通过了第一个项目，他活了下来…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Dragons!" she said, in a disgusted tone, pulling Harry inside. The tent was divided into cubicles; he could make out Cedric's shadow through the canvas, but Cedric didn't seem to be badly injured; he was sitting up, at least. Madam Pomfrey examined Harry's shoulder, talking furiously all the while. "Last year dementors, this year dragons, what are they going to bring into this school next? You're very lucky… this is quite shallow… it'll need cleaning before I heal it up, though…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“火龙！”她用一种厌恶的口吻说，一把将哈利拉了进去。帐篷里分成了几个小隔间，他隔着帆布辨认出塞德里克的身影。看来塞德里克伤得并不严重，至少他已经坐了起来。庞弗雷夫人仔细察看着哈利的肩膀，一边气呼呼地说个不停。“去年是摄魂怪，今年是火龙，接下来他们还要把什么东西带进这所学校？你还算幸运…伤口很浅…不过先要清洗一下，我再给你治疗…”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry didn't want to sit still. He was too full of adrenaline. He got to his feet, wanting to see what was going on outside, but before he'd reached the mouth of the tent, two people had come darting inside -- Hermione, followed closely by Ron.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利不想一动不动地坐着：他太兴奋了。他站了起来，想看看外面的情况，但没等他走到帐篷口，就有两个人迎面冲了进来——是赫敏，后面紧跟着罗恩。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You were the best, you know, no competition. Cedric did this weird thing where he Transfigured a rock on the ground… turned it into a dog… he was trying to make the dragon go for the dog instead of him. Well, it was a pretty cool bit of Transfiguration, and it sort of worked, because he did get the egg, but he got burned as well -- the dragon changed its mind halfway through and decided it would rather have him than the Labrador; he only just got away. And that Fleur girl tried this sort of charm, I think she was trying to put it into a trance -- well, that kind of worked too, it went all sleepy, but then it snored, and this great jet of flame shot out, and her skirt caught fire -- she put it out with a bit of water out of her wand. And Krum -- you won't believe this, but he didn't even think of flying! He was probably the best after you, though. Hit it with some sort of spell right in the eye. Only thing is, it went trampling around in agony and squashed half the real eggs -- they took marks off for that, he wasn't supposed to do any damage to them."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你知道吗，你是最棒的，谁也比不上你。塞德里克做了件古怪的事，他给地上的一块岩石念了变形咒…把它变成了一条狗…他想转移火龙的注意力，让它去追狗。啊，那真是一个很厉害的变形咒，而且真的有点管用，塞德里克拿到了金蛋，但他还是被烧伤了——火龙半途改变了主意，觉得情愿先抓住他，而不是那条纽芬兰猎狗；他差一点儿就逃不掉了。那个叫芙蓉的姑娘施了一种魔法，我想她大概是想使火龙陷入一种催眠状态——不错，那也差不多成功了，火龙一下子就昏昏欲睡了，可是接着它打起呼噜来，喷出好厉害的一道火焰，芙蓉的裙子着了火——她从魔杖里变出水来，把火浇灭了。还有克鲁姆——你简直不会相信，他居然没有想到飞！不过他也很棒，大概仅次于你了。他用一种魔咒直接击中了火龙的眼睛。可惜的是，火龙痛苦地挣扎着，脚踩来踩去，把那些真蛋踩碎了一半——晕个他们要扣分的，他不应该破坏那些蛋。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's marks out of ten from each one," Ron said, and Harry squinting up the field, saw the first judge -- Madame Maxime -- raise her wand in the air. What looked like a long silver ribbon shot out of it, which twisted itself into a large figure eight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“每个人的最高评分不超过十分。”罗恩说，哈利咪着眼睛朝场地眺望，看见第一位裁判——马克西姆夫人——把她的魔杖举向空中。一缕长长的银丝带般的东西从魔杖里喷了出来，扭曲着形成一个大大的“8”字。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What?" Ron bellowed furiously. "Four? You lousy, biased scum-bag, you gave Krum ten!"</div>

<div class="line_en">Ron said he would wait, so Harry reentered the tent, which somehow looked quite different now: friendly and welcoming.

<div class="line_cn" title="罗恩说愿意等他，哈利便再次走进帐篷，现在那帐篷给人的感觉完全不一样了：变得亲切而温馨了。他回想着他躲避树蜂攻击时的感觉，再拿这种感觉与他刚才出去面对树蜂前漫长的等待相比…那种等待的滋味痛苦万分，是没有什么能够比拟的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But Harry didn't care, he wouldn't have cared if Karkaroff had given him zero; Ron's indignation on his behalf was worth about a hundred points to him. He didn't tell Ron this, of course, but his heart felt lighter than air as he turned to leave the enclosure. And it wasn't just Ron… those weren't only Gryffindors cheering in the crowd. When it had come to it, when they had seen what he was facing, most of the school had been on his side as well as Cedric's… He didn't care about the Slytherins, he could stand whatever they threw at him now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是哈利并不在乎，即使卡卡洛夫给他零分，他也不会在乎。罗恩为他打抱不平，这对他来说比一百分还宝贵。当然啦，他没有把这个想法告诉罗恩，但当他转身离开场地时，他觉得自己的心情比空气还要轻盈。而且，为他高兴的不仅是罗恩…人群里为他欢呼的不仅是格兰芬多的学生们。事到临头，当他们看到哈利所面对的挑战时，学校的大多数同学都开始支持他，就像支持塞德里克一样…他不在乎斯莱特林的学生，现在不管他们朝他泼什么脏水，他都能够忍受。">查看中文翻译</div>
