<div class="line_en">Emma's pensive meditations, as she walked home, were not interrupted; but on entering the parlour, she found those who must rouse her. Mr. Knightley and Harriet had arrived during her absence, and were sitting with her father. -- Mr. Knightley immediately got up, and in a manner decidedly graver than usual, said,"I would not go away without seeing you, but I have no time to spare, and therefore must now be gone directly. I am going to London, to spend a few days with John and Isabella. Have you any thing to send or say, besides the `love,' which nobody carries?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Emma's colour was heightened by this unjust praise; and with a smile, and shake of the head, which spoke much, she looked at Mr. Knightley. -- It seemed as if there were an instantaneous impression in her favour, as if his eyes received the truth from her's, and all that had passed of good in her feelings were at once caught and honoured. -- He looked at her with a glow of regard. She was warmly gratified -- and in another moment still more so, by a little movement of more than common friendliness on his part. -- He took her hand; -- whether she had not herself made the first motion, she could not say -- she might, perhaps, have rather offered it-but he took her hand, pressed it, and certainly was on the point of carrying it to his lips -- when, from some fancy or other, he suddenly let it go. -- Why he should feel such a scruple, why he should change his mind when it was all but done, she could not perceive. -- He would have judged better, she thought, if he had not stopped. -- The intention, however, was indubitable; and whether it was that his manners had in general so little gallantry, or however else it happened, but she thought nothing became him more. -- It was with him, of so simple, yet so dignified a nature. -- She could not but recall the attempt with great satisfaction. It spoke such perfect amity. -- He left them immediately afterwards -- gone in a moment. He always moved with the alertness of a mind which could neither be undecided nor dilatory, but now he seemed more sudden than usual in his disappearance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱玛听到这番溢美之词，不由得脸红起来。她意味深长地笑了笑，摇了摇头，望着奈特利先生。奈特利先生似乎立即对她产生了好感，从她的眼里看出了她的一片真情，她心头闪过的美好情感一下被他捕捉住了，赢得了他的尊重。他用热切的目光注视着她。爱玛心里洋洋得意——又了一会，奈特利先生做出了一个异乎寻常的、小小的友好举动，使她越发高兴。他抓住了她的手。爱玛说不清楚，究竟是不是她自己先伸出手来——也许是她先伸出了手——但他一抓住了，握得紧紧的，无疑是要拉到他的嘴唇上——恰在这时，他又转念一想，突然把她的手放下了。他为什么要犹豫，为什么在要吻之前又改变了主意，她也琢磨不透。她心想，他若是不停下来，岂不是更好一些。然而，他的意图是毋庸置疑的，究竟是因为他一向不爱向女人献殷勤，还是由于什么别的原因，她都觉得他这样做是再自然不过了。他生性又纯朴又庄重。她一想起他那个意图，就满心高兴。这说明他们已经完全和好了。接着，他就离开了他们——转眼间就走掉了。他行动一向果断，既不迟疑，也不拖拉，可这一次似乎比平时走得还突然。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Emma could not regret her having gone to Miss Bates, but she wished she had left her ten minutes earlier; -- it would have been a great pleasure to talk over Jane Fairfax's situation with Mr. Knightley. -- Neither would she regret that he should be going to Brunswick Square, for she knew how much his visit would be enjoyed-but it might have happened at a better time-and to have had longer notice of it, would have been pleasanter. -- They parted thorough friends, however; she could not be deceived as to the meaning of his countenance, and his unfinished gallantry; -- it was all done to assure her that she had fully recovered his good opinion. -- He had been sitting with them half an hour, she found. It was a pity that she had not come back earlier!</div>

Mrs. Elton is very good-natured and agreeable, and I dare say her acquaintance are just what they ought to be. I hope it is a dry situation, and that her health will be taken good care of. It ought to be a first object, as I am sure poor Miss Taylor's always was with me. You know, my dear, she is going to be to this new lady what Miss Taylor was to us.

<div class="line_en">"Poor Mrs. Churchill! no doubt she had been suffering a great deal: more than any body had ever supposed-and continual pain would try the temper. It was a sad event-a great shock-with all her faults, what would Mr. Churchill do without her? Mr. Churchill's loss would be dreadful indeed. Mr. Churchill would never get over it." -- Even Mr. Weston shook his head, and looked solemn, and said, "Ah! poor woman, who would have thought it!" and resolved, that his mourning should be as handsome as possible; and his wife sat sighing and moralising over her broad hems with a commiseration and good sense, true and steady. How it would affect Frank was among the earliest thoughts of both. It was also a very early speculation with Emma. The character of Mrs. Churchill, the grief of her husband-her mind glanced over them both with awe and compassion-and then rested with lightened feelings on how Frank might be affected by the event, how benefited, how freed. She saw in a moment all the possible good. Now, an attachment to Harriet Smith would have nothing to encounter. Mr. Churchill, independent of his wife, was feared by nobody; an easy, guidable man, to be persuaded into any thing by his nephew. All that remained to be wished was, that the nephew should form the attachment, as, with all her goodwill in the cause, Emma could feel no certainty of its being already formed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可怜的邱吉尔太太！毫无疑问，她一定受了不少的罪：谁也想象不到有多大的罪——不停地受罪把脾气也折腾坏了。这是件令人悲伤的事——令人震惊——尽避她有不少缺点，可是邱吉尔先生没有了她可怎么办呀？邱吉尔先生真是损失惨重。他会伤心一辈子的。”甚至连韦斯顿先生也摇摇头，神情严肃地说：“哎！可怜的女人，谁想得到啊！”他决定把他的丧服做得尽可能漂亮些。他太太坐在那里一边做着宽折边，一边怀着真挚而深沉的哀思和理念，又是叹息，又是评说。这件事对弗兰克会产生怎样的影响，他们俩从一开始就想过了。爱玛也早就有所考虑。邱吉尔太太的人品，她丈夫的悲哀——在她脑海里掠过，使她又敬畏又同情——随即再想想这件事将给弗兰克带来什么影响，他会怎样得到好处，怎么获得自由，心里不禁高兴起来。她顿时看出了可能带来的种种好处。现在，他要是对哈丽特·史密斯有了情意，就不会遇到什么阻力了。邱吉尔先生了妻子，谁也不会怕他。他这个人脾气随和，容易让人牵着鼻子走，他外甥说什么他都会依从。爱玛只希望那个外甥真的有了情意，因为她虽然抱着一片好意，但却不敢肯定他确已有了情意。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was felt as such things must be felt. Every body had a degree of gravity and sorrow; tenderness towards the departed, solicitude for the surviving friends; and, in a reasonable time, curiosity to know where she would be buried. Goldsmith tells us, that when lovely woman stoops to folly, she has nothing to do but to die; and when she stoops to be disagreeable, it is equally to be recommended as a clearer of ill-fame. Mrs. Churchill, after being disliked at least twenty-five years, was now spoken of with compassionate allowances. In one point she was fully justified. She had never been admitted before to be seriously ill. The event acquitted her of all the fancifulness, and all the selfishness of imaginary complaints.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a more pressing concern to shew attention to Jane Fairfax, whose prospects were closing, while Harriet's opened, and whose engagements now allowed of no delay in any one at Highbury, who wished to shew her kindness-and with Emma it was grown into a first wish. She had scarcely a stronger regret than for her past coldness; and the person, whom she had been so many months neglecting, was now the very one on whom she would have lavished every distinction of regard or sympathy. She wanted to be of use to her; wanted to shew a value for her society, and testify respect and consideration. She resolved to prevail on her to spend a day at Hartfield. A note was written to urge it. The invitation was refused, and by a verbal message. "Miss Fairfax was not well enough to write;" and when Mr. Perry called at Hartfield, the same morning, it appeared that she was so much indisposed as to have been visited, though against her own consent, by himself, and that she was suffering under severe headaches, and a nervous fever to a degree, which made him doubt the possibility of her going to Mrs. Smallridge's at the time proposed. Her health seemed for the moment completely deranged -- appetite quite gone-and though there were no absolutely alarming symptoms, nothing touching the pulmonary complaint, which was the standing apprehension of the family, Mr. Perry was uneasy about her. He thought she had undertaken more than she was equal to, and that she felt it so herself, though she would not own it. Her spirits seemed overcome. Her present home, he could not but observe, was unfavourable to a nervous disorder: -- confined always to one room; -- he could have wished it otherwise -- and her good aunt, though his very old friend, he must acknowledge to be not the best companion for an invalid of that description. Her care and attention could not be questioned; they were, in fact, only too great. He very much feared that Miss Fairfax derived more evil than good from them. Emma listened with the warmest concern; grieved for her more and more, and looked around eager to discover some way of being useful. To take her-be it only an hour or two-from her aunt, to give her change of air and scene, and quiet rational conversation, even for an hour or two, might do her good; and the following morning she wrote again to say, in the most feeling language she could command, that she would call for her in the carriage at any hour that Jane would name -- mentioning that she had Mr. Perry's decided opinion, in favour of such exercise for his patient. The answer was only in this short note:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="更迫切的事，是要关心简·费尔法克斯。在哈丽特的人生出现光明前景时，简的好景却结束了。现在她接受了聘请，海伯里那些一心想关怀她的人，已经到了刻不容缓的地步——而这已成为爱玛的首要愿望。一想起过去冷淡了她，她就比什么都感到后悔。几个月来她一直怠慢的一个人，如今却成了她要百般关怀、深表同情的对象。她要为简做点好事，表示自己珍惜与她的交情，证明自己尊重她、体谅她。她打定主意要动员她到哈特菲尔德来玩一天，于是便写了封信请简来。不想邀请被拒绝了，而且是通过口信：“费尔法克斯小姐身体欠佳，无法写信。”那天上午，佩里先生来到哈特菲尔德时，看来简病得不轻，他没经她本人同意就去看了她。她头痛得厉害，还发着高烧，他怀疑她能否如期去斯莫尔里奇太太家。这一次她的身体似乎全垮了——胃口全然没有了——虽说没有什么令人惊骇的症状，没有全家一直担心的肺病的迹象，佩里先生还是为她担忧。他觉得她承受的负担太重，她自己也感觉到了，只不过不肯承认罢了。她的精神似乎支撑不住了。佩里先生看得出来，她目前的家对一个神经出了毛病的人是不利的：老是守在一间屋子里，但愿能改变这种情况——而她那好小的姨妈，虽然是她多年的老朋友，却不得不承认，并不是这种病人的最佳伴侣。她的关心照料是不成问题的，其实倒是过分了些，他担心反而对费尔法克斯小姐弊多利少。爱玛怀着极其热切的心情听着，越听越为她着急，便四下张望，急于想找个办法帮帮她的忙。把她接出来——哪怕只是一两个小时——离开她姨妈，换换空气和环境，安安静静、合情合理地说说话，哪怕是一两个小时，也许会对她有好处。第二天早上，她又写了封信，以最动情的语言说，不管简说个什么时间，她都可以坐车去接她——并且说佩里先生明确表示，这种活动对病人有好处。回答只是这样一个短简：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Short letters from Frank were received at Randalls, communicating all that was immediately important of their state and plans. Mr. Churchill was better than could be expected; and their first removal, on the departure of the funeral for Yorkshire, was to be to the house of a very old friend in Windsor, to whom Mr. Churchill had been promising a visit the last ten years. At present, there was nothing to be done for Harriet; good wishes for the future were all that could yet be possible on Emma's side.</div>

<div class="line_en">Emma felt that her own note had deserved something better; but it was impossible to quarrel with words, whose tremulous inequality shewed indisposition so plainly, and she thought only of how she might best counteract this unwillingness to be seen or assisted. In spite of the answer, therefore, she ordered the carriage, and drove to Mrs. Bates's, in the hope that Jane would be induced to join her -- but it would not do; -- Miss Bates came to the carriage door, all gratitude, and agreeing with her most earnestly in thinking an airing might be of the greatest service-and every thing that message could do was tried -- but all in vain. Miss Bates was obliged to return without success; Jane was quite unpersuadable; the mere proposal of going out seemed to make her worse. -- Emma wished she could have seen her, and tried her own powers; but, almost before she could hint the wish, Miss Bates made it appear that she had promised her niece on no account to let Miss Woodhouse in. "Indeed, the truth was, that poor dear Jane could not bear to see any body-any body at all -- Mrs. Elton, indeed, could not be denied-and Mrs. Cole had made such a point-and Mrs. Perry had said so much-but, except them, Jane would really see nobody."</div>

Her heart was grieved for a state which seemed but the more pitiable from this sort of irritation of spirits, inconsistency of action, and inequality of powers; and it mortified her that she was given so little credit for proper feeling, or esteemed so little worthy as a friend: but she had the consolation of knowing that her intentions were good, and of being able to say to herself, that could Mr. Knightley have been privy to all her attempts of assisting Jane Fairfax, could he even have seen into her heart, he would not, on this occasion, have found any thing to reprove.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱玛事后听说，就在简。费尔法克斯推说不能活动，断然拒绝同她一起乘车出去的那天下午，却有人看见她在海伯里附近的草场上散步。爱玛把一件件事情串联起来，深深意识到，简是下定决心不肯接受她的情意。爱玛很难过，非常难过。简精神收到刺激，行动前后不一致，力量分配不均衡。这就使她目前的状况比以前更加可怜，爱玛为此感到很伤心。而且，简并不相信她的一片真情，不把她视为朋友，她也感到很委屈，然后她可以聊以的是，她知道自己的用心是好的，她可以对自己说：如果奈特利先生知道她一次次试图帮助简．费尔法克斯，甚至能看透她的一片真心，那他这一次对她就没有什么可指责的了。">查看中文翻译</div>
