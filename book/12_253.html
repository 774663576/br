<div class="line_en">Frodo and Sam returned to their beds and lay there in silence resting for a little, while men bestirred themselves and the business of the day began. After a while water was brought to them, and then they were led to a table where food was set for three. Faramir broke his fast with them. He had not slept since the battle on the day before, yet he did not look weary.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佛罗多和山姆又再度回到床上，沉默地休息了片刻，身旁的人类则是忙着处理跟随新的一天到来的工作。过了不久之后，他们又送上清水让他们盥洗，并且带他们来到另一张打理好的餐桌边。桌旁有三个人的位置，法拉墨和他们一起用早餐。自从前天的战斗之后，他就未曾阖眼，但看来并没有疲态。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When they had finished they stood up. "May no hunger trouble you on the road," said Faramir. "You have little provision, but some small store of food fit for travellers I have ordered to be stowed in your packs. You will have no lack of water as you walk in Ithilien, but do not drink of any stream that flows from Imlad Morgul, the Valley of Living Death. This also I must tell you. My scouts and watchers have all returned, even some that have crept within sight of the Morannon. They all find a strange thing. The land is empty. Nothing is on the road, and no sound of foot, or horn, or bowstring is anywhere to be heard. A waiting silence broods above the Nameless Land. I do not know what this portends. But the time draws swiftly to some great conclusion. Storm is coming. Hasten while you may! If you are ready, let us go. The Sun will soon rise above the shadow."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当三人吃完早餐之后，一起站了起来。“愿你一路不受饥饿所扰！”法拉墨说：“你们的补给实在不是很多，所以，我又命令部下将一些适合长途旅行的食物放进你们的行李中，当你们还在伊西立安之中的时候，就不会有饮水的问题；但是，千万别饮用伊玛拉德魔窟──活死谷中流出的泉水，你们必须切记这一点。我所有的斥候和哨兵都已经回来了，有些甚至曾潜到魔多大门前。他们都发现了一个奇怪的迹象，四处都空无一人，道路上没有任何移防的迹象，也没有脚步声、号角声或是弓弦声，无名之地似乎在等待些什么。我不知道这代表了什么意思。但是似乎一切就快有了定论，风暴将临，趁这个机会赶路吧！如果你们准备好了，就马上出发。太阳很快就会驱赶走阴影的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The hobbits' packs were brought to them (a little heavier than they had been), and also two stout staves of polished wood, shod with iron, and with carven heads through which ran plaited leathern thongs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="旁人将哈比人的背包送了上来（比之前重了一些），另外还有两柄打磨过的坚固手杖，底端包着生铁，上面还有着紧紧绑覆的皮绳。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The hobbits bowed low. "Most gracious host," said Frodo, "it was said to me by Elrond Halfelven that I should find friendship upon the way, secret and unlooked for. Certainly I looked for no such friendship as you have shown. To have found it turns evil to great good."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈比人深深一鞠躬。“您真是太客气了！”佛罗多说：“半精灵爱隆曾经说过，我会在路上找到出乎意料之外的友谊。我的确没有料想到会有你这样的情谊，能够获得你的友谊，就足以将邪恶转为善良。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I have no fitting gifts to give you at our parting," said Faramir; "but take these staves. They may be of service to those who walk or climb in the wild. The men of the White Mountains use them; though these have been cut down to your height and newly shod. They are made of the fair tree lebethron, beloved of the woodwrights of Gondor, and a virtue has been set upon them of finding and returning. May that virtue not wholly fail under the Shadow into which you go!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我没有什么适当的礼物，可以送给即将分别的你们，”法拉墨说：“但是，请你收下这些手杖。它们对于在野外行走的人或许有些帮助。白色山脉中的居民经常使用这种手杖，不过，这是我们刚为了配合你们的身高所削出来的。它们是用美丽的拉比西隆树所打造的，也是刚铎的木匠最爱用的木材，我们对它加上了寻找和物归原主的功效，愿这功能在黑暗的大地中并不会完全失效！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now they made ready to depart. Gollum was brought out of some corner or hiding-hole, and he seemed better pleased with himself than he had been, though he kept close to Frodo and avoided the glance of Faramir.</div>

<div class="line_en">They stood under the boughs of the woods again. No noise of the falls could be heard, for a long southward slope lay now between them and the ravine in which the stream flowed. To the west they could see light through the trees, as if the world came there to a sudden end, at a brink looking out only on to sky.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们又再度站在树林中。在这里听不到瀑布的声音，因为他们现在眼前是一座小溪流过的山谷，他们可以看见西方有光芒穿过树林，仿佛世界突然到了终点，众人面对着空旷的天空。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This was done, and they were led from the cave of Henneth Annûn. After they had passed the passages and stairs they felt the cool morning air, fresh and sweet, about them. Still blind they went on for some little time, up and then gently down. At last the voice of Faramir ordered them to be uncovered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们照做了，被领着离开汉那斯安南的洞穴。在那之后，他们通过了许多的走道和阶梯，感受到晨间清新的空气吹拂在脸上；他们继续被蒙住眼，又上上下下了一段时间。最后，法拉墨命令众人将他们的眼罩除去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Here is the last parting of our ways," said Faramir. "If you take my counsel, you will not turn eastward yet. Go straight on, for thus you will have the cover of the woodland for many miles. On your west is an edge where the land falls into the great vales, sometimes suddenly and sheer, sometimes in long hillsides. Keep near to this edge and the skirts of the forest. In the beginning of your journey you may walk under daylight, I think. The land dreams in a false peace, and for a while all evil is withdrawn. Fare you well, while you may!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们在此必须分离了，”法拉墨说：“如果你愿意接受我的忠告，你们最好还不要往东走，你们可以直接往前走，这样至少还有很长的一段距离可以在森林的掩蔽之下。在你的西方是一座巨大的山谷，有些地方十分陡峭，有些地方则是相当的和缓，靠着悬崖边和森林的边缘走。我想，在你们刚开始赶路的时候可以在白天前进，这块土地处在一种虚伪的安祥中，所有的邪恶都暂时离开此地。再会了，好好保重！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Gollum squealed, and squirmed, and clutched at Frodo, when they came to bind his eyes; and Frodo said: "Blindfold us all three, and cover up my eyes first, and then perhaps he will see that no harm is meant."</div>

The forest where Faramir had stood seemed empty and drear, as if a dream had passed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们以最虔敬的姿态深深一鞠躬，然后法拉墨转过身，头也不回地带着两名侍卫走到一段距离之外。他们惊讶看着这些披着绿衣的人们，竟可以用这么快速的动作前进，几乎一眨眼的功夫就消失了。法拉墨之前所站立的位置显得空荡荡的，彷佛渡过了一场幻梦一般。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Frodo sighed and turned back southward. As if to mark his disregard of all such courtesy, Gollum was scrabbling in the mould at the foot of a tree. "Hungry again already?" thought Sam. "Well, now for it again!"</div>

<div class="line_en">Frodo lay and slept away the night on the deep mould beneath an ancient tree. Sam beside him was more uneasy: he woke many times, but there was never a sign of Gollum, who had slipped off as soon as the others had settled to rest. Whether he had slept by himself in some hole nearby, or had wandered restlessly prowling through the night, he did not say; but he returned with the first glimmer of light, and roused his companions.</div>

<div class="line_en">As the third stage of their day's march drew on and afternoon waned, the forest opened out, and the trees became larger and more scattered. Great ilexes of huge girth stood dark and solemn in wide glades with here and there among them hoary ash-trees, and giant oaks just putting out their brown-green buds. About them lay long launds of green grass dappled with celandine and anemones, white and blue, now folded for sleep; and there were acres populous with the leaves of woodland hyacinths: already their sleek bell-stems were thrusting through the mould. No living creature, beast or bird, was to be seen, but in these open places Gollum grew afraid, and they walked now with caution, flitting from one long shadow to another.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等到他们来到了跋涉的第三阶段时，下午已经快要过完了，森林变得比较开阔，树木也都变得更大、更松散了些。高大的冬青树矗立在宽广的草原上，中间还间或穿插着白杨木，以及一些刚冒出绿芽的古老橡树；草地上则是散布着白屈菜和银莲花，白色和蓝色的花瓣都闭了起来，陷入沉睡之中。在草地上还有许多盖满了落叶的地方，中间生长着风信子，它们小小的钟型花朵已经开始穿透这些落叶，茂盛地生长着。四周看不见任何的飞禽走兽，不过，在这些空旷的地方，咕鲁会变得相当害怕，他们现在必须小心翼翼地走着，从阴影中躲到另一个阴影内。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That day passed much as the day before had gone, except that the silence seemed deeper; the air grew heavy, and it began to be stifling under the trees. It felt as if thunder was brewing. Gollum often paused, sniffing the air, and then he would mutter to himself and urge them to greater speed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天和前一天过的几乎没有什么两样，唯一的差别是那种沉默的感觉变得更深沉了，空气变得更凝重，树下开始有种让人呼吸紧迫的感觉。彷佛远方开始有雷雨在凝聚。咕鲁经常停下脚步，嗅闻着空气，他会自言自语，并且催促大家赶快前进。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Light was fading fast when they came to the forest-end. There they sat under an old gnarled oak that sent its roots twisting like snakes down a steep crumbling bank. A deep dim valley lay before them. On its further side the woods gathered again, blue and grey under the sullen evening, and marched on southwards. To the right the Mountains of Gondor glowed, remote in the West, under a fire-flecked sky. To the left lay darkness: the towering walls of Mordor; and out of that darkness the long valley came, falling steeply in an ever-widening trough towards the Anduin. At its bottom ran a hurrying stream: Frodo could hear its stony voice coming up through the silence; and beside it on the hither side a road went winding down like a pale ribbon, down into chill grey mists that no gleam of sunset touched. There it seemed to Frodo that he descried far off, floating as it were on a shadowy sea, the high dim tops and broken pinnacles of old towers forlorn and dark.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="光线很快的开始消逝，他们这才走到森林的边缘。他们坐在一株苍老的橡树底下，看着它伸出纠结的树根攀爬于悬崖边。他们眼前则是一个深邃、幽暗的山谷，在另外一边，森林又再度茂密起来，在暮色下透露出灰蓝色的光芒，继续往南边延伸。在他们的右边，刚铎的山脉在火红的天空下反射着光芒；左边则是无尽的黑暗，那是魔多的高墙，狭长的山谷就正是穿破那黑暗，极端倾斜地落入安都因的河谷中。山谷底部有一道激流，在这一片寂静中，佛罗多可以听见底下传来水流撞击岩石的声音，在附近则有一条道路蜿蜒而下，切穿没有任何夕阳的光芒可以照到的灰色迷雾中。佛罗多认为远远的似乎看见有些古老的高塔和残破建筑，隐隐漂浮在那一片迷雾中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Frodo looked down on to the road. At any rate nothing was moving on it now. It appeared lonely and forsaken, running down to empty ruins in the mist. But there was an evil feeling in the air, as if things might indeed be passing up and down that eyes could not see. Frodo shuddered as he looked again at the distant pinnacles now dwindling into night, and the sound of the water seemed cold and cruel: the voice of Morgulduin, the polluted stream that flowed from the Valley of the Wraiths.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佛罗多低头看着那路，至少，目前路上没有任何的旅客。它看起来十分的孤单，一路通往云雾中的废墟。不过，空气中有股邪恶的感觉，仿佛似乎有什么隐而不见的邪恶事物在搞鬼。佛罗多看着远方夜色中的高塔，不禁又打了个寒颤，底下的水声似乎变得十分冰冷而残酷，那是魔窟都因河的声音，来自死灵之谷的邪恶之河。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Gollum reluctantly agreed to this, and he turned back towards the trees, working eastward for a while along the straggling edges of the wood. He would not rest on the ground so near the evil road, and after some debate they all climbed up into the crotch of a large holm-oak, whose thick branches springing together from the trunk made a good hiding-place and a fairly comfortable refuge. Night fell and it grew altogether dark under the canopy of the tree. Frodo and Sam drank a little water and ate some bread and dried fruit, but Gollum at once curled up and went to sleep. The hobbits did not shut their eyes.</div>

<div class="line_en">As soon as they were down they went on again with Gollum leading, eastwards, up the dark sloping land. They could see little, for the night was now so deep that they were hardly aware of the stems of trees before they stumbled against them. The ground became more broken and walking was more difficult, but Gollum seemed in no way troubled. He led them through thickets and wastes of brambles; sometimes round the lip of a deep cleft or dark pit, sometimes down into black bush-shrouded hollows and out again; but if ever they went a little downward, always the further slope was longer and steeper. They were climbing steadily. At their first halt they looked back, and they could dimly perceive the roofs of the forest they had left behind, lying like a vast dense shadow, a darker night under the dark blank sky.

<div class="line_en">He quickened his pace, and they followed him wearily. Soon they began to climb up on to a great hog-back of land. For the most part it was covered with a thick growth of gorse and whortleberry, and low tough thorns, though here and there clearings opened, the scars of recent fires. The gorse-bushes became more frequent as they got nearer the top; very old and tall they were, gaunt and leggy below but thick above, and already putting out yellow flowers that glimmered in the gloom and gave a faint sweet scent. So tall were the spiny thickets that the hobbits could walk upright under them, passing through long dry aisles carpeted with a deep prickly mould.</div>

Their twisted boughs, stooping to the ground, were overridden by a clambering maze of old briars. Deep inside there was a hollow hall, raftered with dead branch and bramble, and roofed with the first leaves and shoots of spring. There they lay for a while, too tired yet to eat; and peering out through the holes in the covert they watched for the slow growth of day.</div>

Presently, not far ahead, looming up like a black wall, they saw a belt of trees. As they drew nearer they became aware that these were of vast size, very ancient it seemed, and still towering high, though their tops were gaunt and broken, as if tempest and lightning-blast had swept across them, but had failed to kill them or to shake their fathomless roots.</div>

<div class="line_en">Standing there for a moment filled with dread Frodo became aware that a light was shining; he saw it glowing on Sam's face beside him. Turning towards it, he saw, beyond an arch of boughs, the road to Osgiliath running almost as straight as a stretched ribbon down, down, into the West. There, far away, beyond sad Gondor now overwhelmed in shade, the Sun was sinking, finding at last the hem of the great slow-rolling pall of cloud, and falling in an ominous fire towards the yet unsullied Sea. The brief glow fell upon a huge sitting figure, still and solemn as the great stone kings of Argonath. The years had gnawed it, and violent hands had maimed it. Its head was gone, and in its place was set in mockery a round rough-hewn stone, rudely painted by savage hands in the likeness of a grinning face with one large red eye in the midst of its forehead. Upon its knees and mighty chair, and all about the pedestal, were idle scrawls mixed with the foul symbols that the maggot-folk of Mordor used.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佛罗多满心恐惧地站在该处，这才意识到有种光芒开始闪烁，他看见那光芒照在身旁山姆的脸上。他转过身，透过众多的树木，看见那条通往奥斯吉力亚斯的道路，像是一条缎带一般绵延往西方。在那个方向，越过被暗影笼罩的阴郁刚铎，太阳正在缓缓坠落，终于找到云朵的边缘，散发出它最后的光芒，又彷佛落入燃烧著邪恶之火的大海中。这短暂的光芒照在一个巨大的盘坐雕像之上，这雕像看起来十分庄严，如同之前在亚苟那斯峡谷中所看到的一样。岁月侵蚀了它的外表，邪恶的手也在其上留下了痕迹。它的脑袋被砍掉了，却被放上一颗粗糙的原石，上面用著十分简陋的颜料，绘制出一张咧嘴大笑的邪恶脸孔，额头中央还有一枚红色的眼睛。在它的膝盖和宝座上，四处都刻满了魔多爪牙所使用的粗鲁原始文字。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As furtively as scouts within the campment of their enemies, they crept down on to the road, and stole along its westward edge under the stony bank, grey as the stones themselves, and soft-footed as hunting cats. At length they reached the trees, and found that they stood in a great roofless ring, open in the middle to the sombre sky; and the spaces between their immense boles were like the great dark arches of some ruined hall. In the very centre four ways met. Behind them lay the road to the Morannon; before them it ran out again upon its long journey south; to their right the road from old Osgiliath came climbing up, and crossing, passed out eastward into darkness: the fourth way, the road they were to take.</div>
