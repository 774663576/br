<div class="line_en">"Just stay away from me! Stay away!" Elsa cried. She held her hands up, causing the castle steps to ice over. The Duke's guards slipped and tumbled down to the ground.</div>

<div class="line_en">Elsa looked over her shoulder as she neared the water. When she turned, her foot touched the lapping waves -- and the water in the fjord immediately froze. She took another cautious step… and another sheet of ice bloomed under her foot.</div>

<div class="line_en">Feeling her panic grow, Elsa ran across the fjord. With each step, more water froze underneath her. Soon she was moving at full speed, heading toward the mountains on the other side of the lake. As she passed, the ships belonging to the visiting dignitaries creaked and locked into place, frozen in the ice. The gorgeous summer day had turned into a growing winter storm.</div>

<div class="line_en">Elsa trudged up the steep North Mountain. Ever since she was a child, she had been taught to conceal her powers. Now that was all over. She felt sad and worried as she gazed back at Arendelle far below. She knew no one in Arendelle would ever see her in the same way again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="艾莎沿着北山山坡艰难地行进。自从她儿时起，父母就告诉她要隐藏魔法。然而这一切都结束了。她回头看着越来越远的艾伦戴尔，沮丧而忧伤。她知道艾伦戴尔的所有人以后都会用异样的眼光看她。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"She's my sister," Anna said. "She'd never hurt me." Urging her horse into a gallop, Anna took off over the frozen fjord toward the mountains as snow continued to fall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“她是我姐姐，”安娜说，“她绝对不会伤害我。”雪继续下着，安娜骑马从冰冻的峡湾向山林一路狂奔。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">With a wave of her hand, Elsa started to experiment with her magic. Snow and ice whirled around her as she created snowmen and icy patterns in the air. The farther she got from Arendelle, the more confident she felt. As she took each step, her ability to draw forth ice and cold grew stronger and more powerful.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="艾莎挥了挥手，尝试着使用自己的魔法。她在空中变出了雪人和雪花，冰雪在她身边飞旋。她离艾伦戴尔越远，越发自信。她每走一步，她的冰雪魔力就变得更加强大。">查看中文翻译</div>
