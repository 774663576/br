<div class="line_en">Naïve, idealistic hopes had been shattered. Scholars found that, contrary to the happy wishes of most people, it was not a good idea for the human race as a whole to make contact with extraterrestrials. The impact of such contact on human society would be divisive rather than uniting, and would exacerbate rather than mitigate the conflicts between different cultures. In summary, if contact were to occur, the internal divisions within Earth civilization would be magnified and likely lead to disaster. The most shocking conclusion of all was that the impact would have nothing at all to do with the degree and type of contact (unidirectional or bidirectional), or the form and degree of advancement of the alien civilization.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="以前天真的理想主义愿望破灭了，学者们发现，与大多数人美好的愿望相反，人类不可能作为一个整体与外星文明接触，这种接触对人类文化产生的效应不是融合而是割裂，对人类不同文明间的冲突不是消解而是加剧。总之，接触一旦发生，地球文明的内部差异将急剧拉大，后果可能是灾难性的。最惊人的结论是：这种效应与接触的程度和方式（单向或双向），以及所接触的外星文明的形态和进化程度，没有任何关系！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Wang knew that it was only within the last couple of years that serious and systematic consideration had been given to the question of how and to what degree human societies would be influenced by establishing contact with extraterrestrial intelligence, but the research had rapidly gained interest, and the conclusions were shocking.</div>

<div class="line_en">This was the theory of "contact as symbol" proposed by sociologist Bill Mathers of RAND Corporation in his book, The 100,000-Light-Year Iron Curtain: SETI Sociology. Mathers believed that contact with an alien civilization is only a symbol or a switch. Regardless of the content of the encounter, the results would be the same.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这就是兰德思想库社会学学者比尔·马修在《十万光年铁幕：SETI社会学》一书中提出的“接触符号”理论。他认为，与外星文明的接触，只是一个符号或开关，不管其内容如何，将产生相同的效应。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Suppose that the nature of the contact is such that only the existence of extraterrestrial intelligence is confirmed, with no other substantive information -- what Mathers called elementary contact. The impact would be magnified by the lens of human mass psychology and culture until it resulted in huge, substantive influences on the progress of civilization. If such contact were monopolized by one country or political force, the significance would be comparable to an overwhelming advantage in economic and military power.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="假如发生一个仅仅证明外星文明的存在而没有任何实质内容的接触——马修称其为元接触——其效应也能通过人类群体的心理和文化透镜被放大，对文明的进程产生巨大的实质性的影响。这种接触一旦被某个国家或者政治力量所垄断，其意义与经济和军事实力相当。">查看中文翻译</div>

To comfort Ye, he said, "It's still too early to tell if it succeeded or not. The radio waves sent out by Red Coast haven't gone very far in the universe yet."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汪淼又点点头，他当然知道，如果红岸成功了，世界就不是今天的世界了，但他还是说了一句安慰的话：“其实成功与否现在还不得而知，红岸发出的电波，到现在在宇宙中也没走多远呀。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ye shook her head. "The farther the signals travel, the weaker they become, and the less likely that any extraterrestrial civilization will receive them. Of course, if aliens have already detected the Earth's existence and its oxygen-rich atmosphere and decided to focus powerful equipment specifically at us, the story would be different. But, in general, research shows that in order for extraterrestrials to detect our signals, we must broadcast at a power level equal to the energy output of a midsized star. Soviet astrophysicist Nicolai Kardashev once proposed that civilizations can be divided into three types based on the power they can command -- for communication purposes, let's say. A Type I civilization can muster an amount of energy equivalent to the total energy output of the Earth. Based on his estimates, the energy output of the Earth is about 1015 to 1016 watts. A Type II civilization can marshal the energy equivalent to the output of a typical star --1026 watts. A Type III civilization's communication energy can reach 1036 watts, approximately equal to the energy output of a galaxy. Civilization on Earth is currently about a Type 0.7, not even a full Type I. And the transmissions from Red Coast used only about one ten-millionth of the amount of power the Earth could muster. Our call was like the buzzing of a mosquito in the sky. No one could hear it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="叶文洁摇摇头：“电波信号传得越远越微弱，太空中干扰太多，外星文明收到的可能性很小。研究发现：为了使宇宙中的外星文明接收到我们的电波信号，我们的发射功率应该与一颗中等恒星的辐射功率相当。苏联天体物理学家卡达谢夫曾建议，可以根据宇宙中不同文明用于通讯的能量，来对它们分级。他将想象中的文明分为Ⅰ、Ⅱ、Ⅲ三种类型；Ⅰ型文明能够调集与地球整个输出功率相当的能量用于通讯。当时他的估计，地球的功率输出约为1015～16瓦。Ⅱ型文明能够把相当于一颗典型恒星的输出功率，1026瓦用于通讯。Ⅲ型文明用于通讯的功率达1036瓦，约等于整个星系的功率输出。目前的地球文明只能大致定为0.7型——连Ⅰ型都未达到，而红岸的发射功率又仅仅是地球能调集的输出功率的千万分之一，这一声呼唤，就像万里长空中的一只蚊子在嗡嗡叫，不会有谁听见的！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ye gave a light sigh. "Theoretically, there may never be a definitive answer to that question. But my sense, and the sense of everyone who went through Red Coast, is that that is the case."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="叶文洁轻轻叹息一声：“从理论上讲，这可能是一件永远没有结论的事，但从感觉上，我，还有每一个经历过红岸的人，都认同这点了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“红岸项目被撤销真的很可惜，既然建了，就应该运作下去，这是一项真正伟大的事业啊！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Red Coast's decline was gradual. At the beginning of the eighties, there was a large-scale renovation. Mainly, the transmission and monitoring computer systems were partially upgraded. The transmission system was automated, and the monitoring system incorporated two IBM minicomputers. The data processing capability became far more advanced, and it was able to simultaneously monitor forty thousand channels. But later, as people gained perspective, they had a better appreciation of the difficulty of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, and the leadership lost interest in Red Coast. The first change was reducing the base's security rating. The consensus was that the extreme secrecy around Red Coast was unnecessary, and the security detail at the base was reduced from a company to a squad, until eventually only a group of five security guards were left. Also, after that renovation, although Red Coast remained administratively within the Second Artillery Corps, management of its scientific activities was turned over to the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Astronomy Institute, and it took on some research projects that had nothing to do with the search for extraterrestrial intelligence or the military."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“红岸是逐渐衰落的。上个世纪八十年代初，还进行过次大规模改造，主要是升级了发射和监听部分的计算机系统，发射系统实现了自动化。监听系统引进了两台IBM中型计算机，数据处理能力提高了很多。能同时监听四万个频道。但后来，随着眼界的开阔，人们也清楚了外星文明探索的难度，上级对红岸工程渐渐失去了兴趣。最先看到的变化是基地的密级降低了，当时普遍认为红岸如此高的保密级别是小题大作，基地警卫兵力由一个连减少到一个班，再到后来，只剩下一个五人保卫组了。也是在那次改造以后。红岸的编制虽然仍在二炮，科研管理却移交到中科院天文所，于是承担了一些与外星文明搜索没有关系的研究项目。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Initially, Red Coast also took on some radio astronomy projects. At the time, it was the largest radio telescope in the country. Later, as other radio astronomy observatories were built, Red Coast's research turned to the observation and analysis of solar electromagnetic activity. For this, they added a solar telescope. The mathematical model we built for solar electromagnetic activity was at the forefront of the field back then, and had many practical applications. With these later research results, the large amount invested in Red Coast had at least a little return. Actually, much of the credit should be given to Commissar Lei. Of course he had his own agenda. He realized that as a political officer in a technical unit, his future wasn't bright. Before joining the army, he had studied astrophysics as well, so he wanted to return to doing science. The research projects that Red Coast took on outside of the search for extraterrestrial intelligence were all due to his efforts."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“红岸系统最初是承担了一些射电天文观测项目。那时它是国内最大的射电望远镜。后来，随着其他射电天文观测基地的建立，红岸的研究主要集中在对太阳电磁活动的观测和分析上，为此还加装了一台太阳望远镜，我们建立的太阳电磁活动数学模型当时在那个领域是领先的，也有了许多实际应用。有了后来的这些研究和成果，红岸的巨额投资总算是有了一点点回报。其实这一切有相当部分要归功于雷政委，当然他是有个人目的的。那时他发现，在技术部队搞政工前景不太好，他入伍前也是学天体物理学的，于是就想回到科研上来。红岸基地后来引进的外星文明探索之外的项目，都是他努力的结果。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ye smiled forgivingly. "Without Lei, Red Coast Base would have been finished even earlier. After Red Coast was designated for conversion to civilian use, the military basically abandoned it. Eventually, the Chinese Academy of Sciences couldn't maintain the funds necessary for Red Coast's operation, and it was shut down."</div>

Everything just happened naturally, without any drama. Later, an accident at the base killed both Yang and Lei, and Yang Dong was born after her father's death. The mother and daughter only left Radar Peak in the mid-eighties, when Red Coast Base was finally decommissioned. Ye later returned to Tsinghua, her alma mater, to teach astrophysics until retirement. All this Wang had heard from Sha Ruishan at the Miyun Radio Astronomy Observatory.</div>

The universe was an empty palace, and humankind the only ant in the entire palace. This kind of thinking infused the second half of my life with a conflicted mentality: Sometimes I thought life was precious, and everything was so important; but other times I thought humans were insignificant, and nothing was worthwhile.
