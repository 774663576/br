<div class="line_en">It is the first step that counts. The Rubicon passed, one lends himself to pears, a loaf of hard bread, some wafers, and a full cup of pickled gherkins and onions, of which crudities Ball-of-Fat, like all women, was extremely fond.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Count decided the question. He turned toward the fat, intimidated girl and, taking on a grand air of condescension, he said to her:"We accept with gratitude, Madame."</div>

<div class="line_en">Then Ball-of-Bat, blushing and embarrassed, looked at the four travelers who had fasted and stammered:"Goodness knows! if I cared to offer anything to these gentlemen and ladies, I would --" Then she was silent, as if fearing an insult. Loiseau took up the word:"Ah! certainly, in times like these all the world are brothers and ought to aid each other. Come, ladies, without ceremony; why the devil not accept? We do not know whether we shall even find a house where we can pass the night. At the pace we are going now, we shall not reach Tôtes before noon tomorrow --"</div>

<div class="line_en">"I believed at first that I could remain,"she said. "I had my house full of provisions, and I preferred to feed a few soldiers rather than expatriate myself, to go I knew not where. But as soon as I saw them, those Prussians, that was too much for me! They made my blood boil with anger, and I wept for very shame all day long. Oh! if I were only a man! I watched them from my windows, the great porkers with their pointed helmets, and my maid held my hands to keep me from throwing the furniture down upon them. Then one of them came to lodge at my house; I sprang at his throat the first thing; they are no more difficult to strangle than other people. And I should have put an end to that one then and there had they not pulled me away by the hair. After that, it was necessary to keep out of sight. And finally, when I found an opportunity, I left town and-here I am!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“开初我以为自己能够待下去。家里本来满是吃的东西，甘愿养几个兵士，决不离开家乡跑到旁的地方去。不过等到我看见了那些家伙，那些普鲁士人，我真不由自主了！他们使得我满肚子全是怒气了，我惭愧得哭了一天。哈！倘若我是个男子汉，上前去吧！我从窗子里望着他们，那些戴着尖顶铁盔的肥猪，于是我的女佣人抓住我的双手，免得我把我的桌子椅子扔到他们的脊梁上。随后有几个到我家里来住宿了；那时候，我扑到了其中第一个的脖子上。掐死他们并不比掐死其余的人格外难！倘若没有人抓着我的头发，我是可以结果那一个的。事后我不得不躲藏了。到末了，我找着了机会就动身了，现在我在这儿。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They could not eat this girl's provisions without speaking to her. And so they chatted, with reserve at first; then, as she carried herself well, with more abandon. The ladies De Breville and Carré-Lamadon, who were acquainted with all the ins and outs of good-breed-ing, were gracious with a certain delicacy. The Countess, especially, showed that amiable condescension of very noble ladies who do not fear being spoiled by con-tact with anyone, and was charming. But the great Madame Loiseau, who had the soul of a plebeian, remained crabbed, saying little and eating much.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吃了这个“姑娘”的东西自然不能不和她说话。所以大家谈天了，开初，姿态是慎重的，随后，因为她的态度很好，大家也就随便得多。卜来韦和迦来－辣马东两位夫人本来都很懂得处世之道，现在都妙曼地显出和颜悦色的样子，尤其是伯爵夫人，她显出了那种一尘不染的高级贵妇人的和蔼的谦虚样子，并且来得娇媚。不过那个高大的鸟夫人素来怀着保安警察的心理，所以仍旧是顽梗不化，话说得少而东西吃得多。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The conversation was about the war, naturally. They related the horrible deeds of the Prussians, the brave acts of the French; and all of them, although running away, did homage to those who stayed behind. Then personal stories began to be told, and Ball-of-Fat related, with sincere emotion, and in the heated words that such girls sometimes use in expressing their natural feelings, how she had left Rouen:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大家自然谈到战事了。叙述到普鲁士人的种种骇人的事实，法国人的种种英勇的行动；而这些逃难的男男女女对于旁人的勇气都表示尊敬，不久大家开始说到个人的经历了，羊脂球用一种真正的愤慨，用那种在姑娘们表现天然怒气的时候往往使用的热烈语言，叙述自己怎样离开卢昂，她说：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They congratulated her. She grew in the estimation of her companions, who had not shown themselves so hot-brained, and Cornudet, while listening to her, took on the approving, benevolent smile of an apostle, as a priest would if he heard a devotee praise God, for the long-bearded democrats have a monopoly of patriotism, as the men in cassocks have a religion. In his turn he spoke, in a doctrinal tone, with the emphasis of a proclamation such as we see pasted on the walls about town, and finished by a bit of eloquence whereby he gave that"scamp of a Badinguet"a good lashing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大家称赞她了。在这些没有表示那么猛干的旅伴的评价中间，她的地位增高了；戈尔弩兑静听着她，一面保持一种心悦诚服者的赞叹而且亲切的微笑；甚至于就像一个教士听见一个信徒赞美上帝，因为长胡子的民主朋友都有爱国主义专卖权，正和穿道袍的汉子们都有宗教专卖权一样。轮到他发言，他用一种理论家的语调，用那种从每天粘在墙上的宣言里学得来的夸张口吻发言了，末后他用一段雄辩作了结论，用威严的态度攻击那个“流氓样的巴丹盖。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then Ball-of-Fat was angry, for she was a Bona-partist. She grew redder than a cherry and, stammering with indignation, said:"I would like to have seen you in his place, you other people. Then everything would have been quite right; oh, yes! It is you who have betrayed this man! One would never have had to leave France if it had been governed by blackguards like you!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过羊脂球立刻生气了，因为她是波拿巴党，她的脸蛋儿红得像是一颗樱桃，噘着嘴巴气忿地说：“我真要看看你们坐在他的位子上会怎么干，你们这些人。那大概是很像样的，对呀！这回正是你们出卖了他，这个人！倘若人都被你们这样胡作非为的人统治，那么只好离开法国了！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Cornudet, undisturbed, preserved a disdainful, superior smile, but all felt that the high note had been struck, until the Count, not without some difficulty, calmed the exasperated girl and proclaimed with a manner of authority that all sincere opinions should be respected. But the Countess and the manufacturer's wife, who had in their souls an unreasonable hatred for the people that favor a Republic, and the same instinctive tenderness that all women have for a decorative, despotic government, felt themselves drawn, in spite of them-selves, toward this prostitute so full of dignity, whose sentiments so strongly resembled their own.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="戈尔弩兑是意气自若的，始终保持一种高高在上的轻蔑微笑，不过大家觉得骂街的字眼差不多要出口了，这时候，伯爵插入中间费着劲儿安定那个怒气冲天的“姑娘”，一面用权威的态度声言一切诚实的见解都是可以敬重的。伯爵夫人和厂长夫人，她们的脑子里素来怀着正经人对于共和国而起的无理憎恨，以及一切妇女对于神气活现实行专制的政府而抱的天然爱惜，都不由自主地觉得自己倾向于这个难能可贵的卖淫妇了：她的情感和她们的真很相像。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The night fell, the darkness little by little became profound, and the cold, felt more during digestion, made Ball-of-Fat shiver in spite of her plumpness. Then Madame de Breville offered her the little footstove, in which the fuel had been renewed many times since morning; she accepted it immediately, for her feet were becoming numb with cold. The ladies Carré-Lamadon and Loiseau gave theirs to the two religious sisters.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="夜色下来了，黑暗渐渐变成了深沉的，寒气在人消化食物的时候是更其使人觉得的，羊脂球尽管富于脂肪，寒气也有些使得她发噤，于是卜来韦夫人把自己的袖珍手炉送给她用，那里边的炭从早上到现在已经换了好几回，羊脂球立刻接受了这种好意，因为她觉得自己的脚冻木了。迦来－辣马东夫人和鸟夫人把她俩的借给了两个嬷嬷。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The driver had lighted his lanterns. They shone out with lively glimmer showing a cloud of foam beyond, the sweat of the horses; and, on both sides of the way, the snow seemed to roll itself along under the moving reflection of the lights.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="赶车的点燃了车外的风灯。灯光是明亮而闪动的，照见辕子两边的牲口臀部的汗气像云气一样飘浮；大路两边的雪仿佛在移动的亮光底下伸展。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The basket was empty. By ten o'clock they had easily exhausted the contents and regretted that there was not more. Conversation continued for some time, but a little more coldly since they had finished eating.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="提篮空了。十个人不用费事吃空了它，一面认为它当初没有编得更大一点未免可惜。谈话又继续了一会，不过自从吃完了以后却多少冷落一些。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Inside the carriage one could distinguish nothing. But a sudden movement seemed to be made between Ball-of-Fat and Cornudet; and Loiseau, whose eye penetrated the shadow, believed that he saw the big-bearded man start back quickly as if he had received a swift, noiseless blow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="车子里什么也分辨不出来了，不过在羊脂球和戈尔弩兑中间忽然起了一种动作；鸟老板的眼睛正在暗中窥探，他相信看见那个大胡子突然向旁一偏，如同沉重地接受了什么没有声音的打击。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The carriage door opened! A well-known sound gave the travelers a start; it was the scabbard of a sword hitting the ground. Immediately a German voice was heard in the darkness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="车门开了！一阵听惯了的声音教所有的旅客感到心惊肉跳；那正是军刀鞘子接接连接撞着路面。立刻就有一个日耳曼人的声音嚷着几句话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Although the diligence was not moving, no one offered to alight, fearing some one might be waiting to murder them as they stepped out. Then the conductor appeared, holding in his hand one of the lanterns which lighted the carriage to its depth, and showed the two rows of frightened faces, whose mouths were open and whose eyes were wide with surprise and fear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="车子虽然停了，不过谁也没有下来，仿佛正有人等着旅客一下车就来屠杀。这时候，赶车的出面了，他从车外取下一盏风灯拿着向车里一照，登时照明了车子内部那两行神色张皇的脸儿，因为惊惧交集，眼睛都是睁大的，嘴巴全是张开的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Outside beside the driver, in plain sight, stood a German officer, an excessively tall young man, thin and blond, squeezed into his uniform like a girl in a corset, and wearing on his head a flat, oilclotn cap which made him resemble the porter of an English hotel. His enormous mustache, of long straight hairs, growing gradually thin at each side and terminating in a single blond thread so fine that one could not perceive where it ended, seemed to weigh heavily on the corners of his mouth and, drawing down the cheeks, left a decided wrinkle about the lips.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在赶车的旁边，灯光当中站着一个日耳曼军官，一个非常之瘦的长个儿青年人，头发是金黄的，军服紧紧地缚着他的腰身仿佛是一个女孩子缚着腰甲，平顶的漆皮军帽歪歪地偏向一边，使人觉得他很像一家英国旅馆里的小使。他两撇长得过度的髭须直挺挺地翘起，不断地向上收束，最后只有一茎金黄色的毫毛，纤细得教人望不见它的杪末，那像是压着他的嘴角儿，牵着他的腮帮子，在嘴唇上印出一道下坠的折纹。">查看中文翻译</div>
