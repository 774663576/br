<div class="line_en">His instinct was to reach for his cane. He had kept it by his bed the last few years, because there were mornings when he no longer had the strength to get up without it. This embarrassed Eddie, who used to punch men in the shoulders when he greeted them.</div>

<div class="line_en">Eddie awoke in a teacup.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱迪在一个茶杯里醒了过来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was a part of some old amusement park ride -- a large teacup, made of dark, polished wood, with a cushioned seat and a steel-hinged door. Eddie's arms and legs dangled over the edges. The sky continued to change colors, from a shoe-leather brown to a deep scarlet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是一座老式游乐车——一个硕大的茶杯，用乌黑发亮的木头做成，有一个贴着坐垫的椅子和一扇带钢折叶的门。爱迪的胳膊和腿搭在茶杯沿上。天空不断地变幻着色调，从皮鞋的棕色，变成了殷红色。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">First, he felt wonderful.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第一，他感觉好极了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But now there was no cane, so Eddie exhaled and tried to pull himself up. Surprisingly, his back did not hurt. His leg did not throb. He yanked harder and hoisted himself easily over the edge of the teacup, landing awkwardly on the ground, where he was struck by three quick thoughts.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，这会儿，拐杖不见了，爱迪嘘了口气，试着站起身来。令人吃惊的是，他的背不痛了，腿也不痛了。他再一使劲，结果，他轻松地翻过了茶杯沿，脚跟不稳地站到了地上。他脑子里忽然闪过三个念头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Second, he was all alone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二，他独自一人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But it was a different Ruby Pier now. There were canvas tents and vacant grassy sections and so few obstructions you could see the mossy breakwater out in the ocean. The colors of the attractions were firehouse reds and creamy whites -- no teals or maroons -- and each ride had its own wooden ticket booth. The teacup he had awoken in was part of a primitive attraction called Spin-O-Rama. Its sign was plywood, as were the other low-slung signs, hinged on storefronts that lined the promenade: El Tiempo Cigars! Now, That's a Smoke!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，这是一个截然不同的“红宝石码头”。帆布帐篷，宽阔的草坪，你几乎可以眼无遮蔽地看到海里长满青苔的防浪堤。游乐设施是消防站的红色和乳白色——没有蓝绿或棕紫——而且，每座游乐设施都有自己用木板搭成的售票厅。爱迪醒来时坐的茶杯，是一座很原始的游乐车，叫做“旋转茶杯”。游乐车招牌是用胶合板做成的，红宝石码头大街两旁的铺面前，都低低地挂着这样的招牌：阿尔典雪茄！货真价实！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Eddie blinked hard. This was the Ruby Pier of his childhood, some 75 years ago, only everything was new, freshly scrubbed. Over there was the Loop-the-Loop ride -- which had been torn down decades ago -- and over there the bathhouses and the saltwater swimming pools that had been razed in the 1950s. Over there, jutting into the sky, was the original Ferris wheel -- in its pristine white paint -- and beyond that, the streets of his old neighborhood and the rooftops of the crowded brick tenements, with laundry lines hanging from the windows. Eddie tried to yell, but his voice was raspy air. He mouthed a "Hey!" but nothing came from his throat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱迪使劲地眨了眨眼睛。这是他童年时代的“红宝石码头”，大约七十五年前，惟一不同的是，一切都是崭新的，刚被刷过。那边是“螺旋滑行车”——几十年前已被拆除了的——那边是公共澡堂和海水游泳池，五十年代那会儿已经夷为平地了。再往那边，那高耸入云的，是最早的“阜氏摩天巨轮”——仍然涂着原先的白漆——再过去，便是他童年时的老街区和拥挤的砖结构出租公寓的房顶，窗前扯着一道道晒衣服的绳子。爱迪想喊，但是他的声音只是一团粗糙的气息。他用嘴做成一个“嘿”的形状，喉咙里却没有发出任何声音。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He grabbed at his arms and legs. Aside from his lack of voice, he felt incredible. He walked in a circle. He jumped. No pain. In the last ten years, he had forgotten what it was like to walk without wincing or to sit without struggling to find comfort for his lower back. On the outside, he looked the same as he had that morning: a squat barrel-chested old man in a cap and shorts and a brown maintenance jersey. But he was limber. So limber, in fact, he could touch behind his ankles, and raise a leg to his belly. He explored his body like an infant, fascinated by the new mechanics, a rubber man doing a rubber man stretch.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他抓了抓自己的胳膊和腿。除了发不出声音之外，他感觉好极了。他走了一圈。他跳了跳。不觉得痛。在过去的十年里，他已经忘记了走路不痛是什么滋味，每次坐下时都要选好角度避免腰背痛。从外表看去，他同那天早晨没什么两样：胖墩墩的阔胸老人，戴了顶帽子，穿着短裤和棕色工作衫。但是，他现在灵敏多了。实际上，他灵敏得可以伸手够到脚踝骨后面，可以把一条腿抬到腹部。他像婴儿一样探索着自己的身体，被身体的新功能给迷住了，就像一个橡胶人在做伸展表演。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He ran down the heart of the old midway, where the weight guessers, fortune-tellers, and dancing gypsies had once worked. He lowered his chin and held his arms out like a glider, and every few steps he would jump, the way children do, hoping running will turn to flying. It might have seemed ridiculous to anyone watching, this white-haired maintenaance worker, all alone, making like an airplane. But the running boy is inside every man, no matter how old he gets.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他从旧游艺场的中心跑过，这里过去曾经是猜体重的人，算命的人和跳舞的吉普赛人工作的地方。他像一架滑翔机那样，收拢下颏，伸出双臂，每跑几步便跳一下，像孩子那样，仿佛跑着跑着就能飞起来了。若是有人看见，可能会觉得滑稽，这个白发苍苍的维修工，独自一人，模仿着飞机在滑翔。话说回来，每一个男人身上都有一个正在奔跑的男孩子，不管他变得多么苍老。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ha-ha! Running! Eddie had not truly run in more than 60 years, not since the war, but he was running now, starting with a few gingerly steps, then accelerating into a full gait, faster, faster, like the running boy of his youth. He ran along the boardwalk, past a bait-and-tackle stand for fishermen (five cents) and a bathing suit rental stand for swimmers (three cents). He ran past a chute ride called The Dipsy Doodle. He ran along the Ruby Pier Promenade, beneath magnificent buildings of moorish design with spires and minarets and onion-shaped domes. He ran past the Parisian Carousel, with its carved wooden horses, glass mirrors, and Wurlitzer organ, all shiny and new. Only an hour ago, it seemed, he had been scraping rust from its pieces in the shop.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈——哈！跑哇！六十多年了，自从战争结束以后，爱迪就没有真正地跑过，但是，他现在跑起了，先是战战兢兢地试探了几步，然后，大踏步加速，快了，更快了，就像他年轻时那个奔跑的小伙子。他沿着海滨走道一路奔跑，经过玩钓鱼游戏的摊位（五分钱）和出租游泳衣的摊位（三分钱）。他跑过一架叫做“悠悠滑”的大滑梯。他沿着红宝石码头大街奔跑，头顶上是摩尔式的雄伟建筑，有尖尖的塔顶和洋葱形的圆屋顶。他跑过“巴黎式旋转木马”，一匹匹雕刻出的木马，玻璃镜子和乌力册风琴，全部簇新锃亮。似乎仅在一个小时之前，他还在车间里从旋转木马的零配件上刮铁锈来着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Eddie peered into the entrance. He had encountered some odd people here. There was Jolly Jane, who weighed over 500 pounds and needed two men to push her up the stairs. There were conjoined twin sisters, who shared a spine and played musical instruments. There were men who swallowed swords, women with beards, and a pair of Indian brothers whose skin went rubbery from being stretched and soaked in oils, until it hung in bunches from their limbs.</div>

<div class="line_en">There, sitting in a chair, alone on the stage, was a middle-aged man with narrow, stooped shoulders, naked from the waist up. His belly sagged over his belt.

<div class="line_en">Eddie, as a child, had felt sorry for the sideshow cast. They were forced to sit in booths or on stages, sometimes behind bars, as patrons walked past them, leering and pointing. A barker would ballyhoo the oddity, and it was a barker's voice that Eddie heard now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱迪小的时候，曾经为那些杂耍演员感到难过。他们被迫坐在小棚子里或者舞台上，有时还被关在铁笼里，人们打旁边走过，斜着眼睛，又是指点又是嘲弄。一个喊场人还会大吹大擂，指出这些人的怪异之处，爱迪这会儿听到的正是喊场人的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>
