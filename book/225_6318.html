<div class="line_en">Up the broad flight of shallow steps, Monsieur the Marquis, flambeau preceded, went from his carriage, sufficiently disturbing the darkness to elicit loud remonstrance from an owl in the roof of the great pile of stable building away among the trees. All else was so quiet, that the flambeau carried up the steps, and the other flambeau held at the great door, burnt as if they were in a close room of state, instead of being in the open night-air. Other sound than the owl's voice there was none, save the falling of a fountain into its stone basin; for, it was one of those dark nights that hold their breath by the hour together, and then heave a long low sigh, and hold their breath again.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a heavy mass of building, that chateau of Monsieur the Marquis, with a large stone courtyard before it, and two stone sweeps of staircase meeting in a stone terrace before the principal door. A stony business altogether, with heavy stone balustrades, and stone urns, and stone flowers, and stone faces of men, and stone heads of lions, in all directions. As if the Gorgon's head had surveyed it, when it was finished, two centuries ago.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="侯爵的庄园是一座巍峨的建筑，前面是一片巨大的石砌庭院。大门左右两道石级在门前的平台上会合，这是个石工的世界。巨大的石阶梯，四面八方的石雕耳瓶、石雕花朵、石雕人面、石雕狮头，仿佛两百年前刚竣工时曾被果刚的脑袋望过一眼。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The great door clanged behind him, and Monsieur the Marquis crossed a hall grim with certain old boar-spears, swords, and knives of the chase; grimmer with certain heavy riding-rods and riding-whips, of which many a peasant, gone to his benefactor Death, had felt the weight when his lord was angry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="沉重的大门在他身后哐当地关上，候爵大人走进了一间阴森森的大厅。那里有狩猎用的野猪矛、长剑和短刀，还有马鞭和棍子。这些东西更阴森，好些农民因为触怒了老爷曾领教过它们的分量，有的索性到解脱痛苦的恩主死亡那儿去了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Avoiding the larger rooms, which were dark and made fast for the night, Monsieur the Marquis, with his flambeau-bearer going on before, went up the staircase to a door in a corridor. This thrown open, admitted him to his own private apartment of three rooms: his bed-chamber and two others. High vaulted rooms with cool uncarpeted floors, great dogs upon the hearths for the burning of wood in winter time, and all luxuries befitting the state of a marquis in a luxurious age and country. The fashion of the last Louis but one, of the line that was never to break -- the fourteenth Louis -- was conspicuous in their rich furniture; but, it was diversified by many objects that were illustrations of old pages in the history of France.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="侯爵避开黑魈魈的已经关闭过夜的大房间，在火炬手引导下走上石阶，来到走廊中的一道门前。门敞开了，他进入了自己的居室。那是一套三间的房屋，一间卧室，两间住房，有着高大的拱门和没铺地毯的冰凉的地板。壁炉上有堆放冬季劈柴的薪架，还有适合于一个奢侈时代中奢侈国家的侯爵身份的一切奢侈品。上一代的路易王，万世不绝的王家世系的路易十四朝的风格在这些华丽的家具上表现得很明显。其中也间杂了许多例证，反映出法兰西历史中一些其它的古老篇章。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I perceive that, happily for me, the Reception of the day before yesterday was, as usual, a cold one," observed the nephew.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我很高兴地发现，前天的官廷接见仍然—如既往，态度冷淡，”侄子说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I believe that if you were not in disgrace with the Court, and had not been overshadowed by that cloud for years past, a letter de cachet would have sent me to some fortress indefinitely."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我相信你若不是在宫廷失宠，也不曾在多年前那片阴云的笼罩之下，你可能早就用一张空白逮捕证把我送到某个要塞无限期地幽囚起来了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I would not say happily, my friend," returned the uncle, with refined politeness; "I would not be sure of that. A good opportunity for consideration, surrounded by the advantages of solitude, might influence your destiny to far greater advantage than you influence it for yourself. But it is useless to discuss the question. I am, as you say, at a disadvantage. These little instruments of correction, these gentle aids to the power and honour of families, these slight favours that might so incommode you, are only to be obtained now by interest and importunity. They are sought by so many, and they are granted (comparatively) to so few! It used not to be so, but France in all such things is changed for the worse. Our not remote ancestors held the right of life and death over the surrounding vulgar. From this room, many such dogs have been taken out to be hanged; in the next room (my bedroom), one fellow, to our knowledge, was poniarded on the spot for professing some insolent delicacy respecting his daughter -- his daughter? We have lost many privileges; a new philosophy has become the mode; and the assertion of our station, in these days, might (I do not go so far as to say would, but might) cause us real inconvenience. All very bad, very bad!"</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“镇压是唯一经久耐用的哲学。恐怖与奴役造成阴沉的尊敬，我的朋友，”侯爵说，“可以让狗听从鞭子的命令——只要房顶还能遮挡住天空。”说时他望了望房顶。">查看中文翻译</div>

If a picture of the chateau as it was to be a very few years hence, and of fifty like it as they too were to be a very few years hence, could have been shown to him that night, he might have been at a loss to claim his own from the ghastly, fire-charred, plunder-wrecked rains. As for the roof he vaunted, he might have found that shutting out the sky in a new way -- to wit, for ever, from the eyes of the bodies into which its lead was fired, out of the barrels of a hundred thousand muskets.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="房顶未必能如侯爵设想的那么长久地遮挡住天空。若是那天晚上侯爵能看到几年后那所庄园和其它五十个类似庄园的画面的话，他恐怕难以想象那片抢掠一空的烧成焦炭的废墟竟会是他今天的庄园。至于他刚才吹嘘的屋顶，他可能发现它将用另一种方式遮挡住天空——就是说，让屋顶化作铅弹，从十万支毛瑟枪枪管射出，使人们的眼睛永远对天空闭上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Lighter and lighter, until at last the sun touched the tops of the still trees, and poured its radiance over the hill. In the glow, the water of the chateau fountain seemed to turn to blood, and the stone faces crimsoned. The carol of the birds was loud and high, and, on the weather-beaten sill of the great window of the bed-chamber of Monsieur the Marquis, one little bird sang its sweetest song with all its might. At this, the nearest stone face seemed to stare amazed, and, with open mouth and dropped under-jaw, looked awe-stricken.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="晨曦渐明，太阳终于触到了平静的树梢，把它的光芒浇注在山上。朝霞里，庄园的喷泉似乎变成了血，石像的脸染成了猩红。鸟儿欢乐地高奏出一片喧哗。侯爵卧室那饱经风霜的巨大窗户的窗棂上一只小鸟正竭尽全力唱出最甜美的歌。靠窗最近的石雕人像似乎听得呆了，张大了嘴，垂下了下巴，听得心惊胆战。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For three heavy hours, the stone faces of the chateau, lion and human, stared blindly at the night. Dead darkness lay on all the landscape, dead darkness added its own hush to the hushing dust on all the roads. The burial-place had got to the pass that its little heaps of poor grass were undistinguishable from one another; the figure on the Cross might have come down, for anything that could be seen of it. In the village, taxers and taxed were fast asleep. Dreaming, perhaps, of banquets, as the starved usually do, and of ease and rest, as the driven slave and the yoked ox may, its lean inhabitants slept soundly, and were fed and freed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="庄园里的石面孔（狮子的面孔，人的面孔）茫然地望着黑夜，望了三个沉重的小时。死沉沉的黑暗笼罩了一切；死沉沉的黑暗使道路上死寂的灰尘更加死寂，坟地里蔓草凄迷，可怜的一小片一小片的草皮彼此已无法区分。十字架上的耶稣见到任何东西都可能走下来。村子里的人（收税的和交税的）都睡着了。枯瘦的村民也许梦见了饥饿者常梦见的筵席，也许梦见了被驱赶干活的奴隶和牛马常梦见的轻松和休息。总之睡得很香，在梦里吃得很饱，而且自由自在。">查看中文翻译</div>

Then, the grey water of both began to be ghostly in the light, and the eyes of the stone faces of the chateau were opened.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="村里，泉水奔流着，看不见，也听不到；庄园里，喷泉喷溅着，看不见，也听不到；两者都像从时间之泉喷出的分分秒秒，喷出便消失，喷了三个黑暗的小时。然后两者的灰白的水都在晨曦里闪着幽灵似的光，庄园的石头面孔睁开了眼睛。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The chateau awoke later, as became its quality, but awoke gradually and surely. First, the lonely boar-spears and knives of the chase had been reddened as of old; then, had gleamed trenchant in the morning sunshine; now, doors and windows were thrown open, horses in their stables looked round over their shoulders at the light and freshness pouring in at doorways, leaves sparkled and rustled at iron-grated windows, dogs pulled hard at their chains, and reared impatient to be loosed.</div>

Casement windows opened, crazy doors were unbarred, and people came forth shivering -- chilled, as yet, by the new sweet air. Then began the rarely lightened toil of the day among the village population. Some, to the fountain; some, to the fields; men and women here, to dig and delve; men and women there, to see to the poor live stock, and lead the bony cows out, to such pasture as could be found by the roadside. In the church and at the Cross, a kneeling figure or two; attendant on the latter prayers, the led cow, trying for a breakfast among the weeds at its foot.</div>

Had the birds, carrying some grains of it to a distance, dropped one over him as they sow chance seeds? Whether or no, the mender of roads ran, on the sultry morning, as if for his life, down the hill, knee-high in dust, and never stopped till he got to the fountain.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="这一切琐碎的活动都是晨光再现时的生活常规。可是庄园的大钟却敲起来了，台阶上步履上下，人影闪动，然后是杂沓的脚步声四处响起，马匹匆匆地配好鞍离开了。这一切难道也是生活常规么？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">All the people of the village were at the fountain, standing about in their depressed manner, and whispering low, but showing no other emotions than grim curiosity and surprise. The led cows, hastily brought in and tethered to anything that would hold them, were looking stupidly on, or lying down chewing the cud of nothing particularly repaying their trouble, which they had picked up in their interrupted saunter. Some of the people of the chateau, and some of those of the posting-house, and all the taxing authorities, were armed more or less, and were crowded on the other side of the little street in a purposeless way, that was highly fraught with nothing. Already, the mender of roads had penetrated into the midst of a group of fifty particular friends, and was smiting himself in the breast with his blue cap. What did all this portend, and what portended the swift hoisting-up of Monsieur Gabelle behind a servant on horseback, and the conveying away of the said Gabelle (double-laden though the horse was), at a gallop, like a new version of the German ballad of Leonora?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="村里的人全在泉水边神态沮丧地站着，悄悄谈话，除了表现出忧心忡忡的好奇与惊讶外，没有露出别的感情。匆匆牵来、就便拴住的母牛有的傻望着，有的躺着反刍，咀嚼着在它们被停止漫游时啃到嘴里的并不可口的东西。一部分庄园的人、一部分驿站的人和全部税务入员都多少武装了起来，无目的地挤在小街的另一边，都很紧张，却都闲着没事。补路工已经挤进了五十个特别好的朋友群里，一面用蓝帽子抽打着自己的胸脯。这一切预示着什么？加伯尔先生此时又在一个已骑在马上的仆入身后匆匆上了马，那马虽有了双重负担却也飞快地跑开了，像是德国民歌利昂诺拉的另一个版本。这又预示着什么？">查看中文翻译</div>
