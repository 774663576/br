<div class="line_en">The program ended and I returned to BYU. Campus looked the way it always had, and it would have been easy to forget Cambridge and settle back into the life I'd had there. But Professor Steinberg was determined that I not forget. He sent me an application for something called the Gates Cambridge Scholarship, which, he explained, was a little like the Rhodes Scholarship, but for Cambridge instead of Oxford. It would provide full funding for me to study at Cambridge, including tuition, room and board. As far as I was concerned it was comically out of reach for someone like me, but he insisted that it was not, so I applied.</div>

<div class="line_en">Perhaps both of us were thinking of our history, or perhaps only I was. I thought of Joseph Smith, who'd had as many as forty wives. Brigham Young had had fifty-five wives and fifty-six children. The church had ended the temporal practice of polygamy in 1890, but it had never recanted the doctrine. As a child I'd been taught -- by my father but also in Sunday school -- that in the fullness of time God would restore polygamy, and in the afterlife, I would be a plural wife. The number of my sister wives would depend on my husband's righteousness: the more nobly he lived, the more wives he would be given.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="也许我们俩都在思考我们的历史，也许只是我一个人在思考。我想起了约瑟夫·史密斯，他有四十多个妻子。杨百翰有五十五个妻子和五十六个孩子。教会在一八九〇年结束了一夫多妻制，但从未放弃这一教义。从小父亲就教导我——主日学校也教导过——时机成熟时上帝会恢复一夫多妻制；来世我将成为某个男人的若干妻子之一。我丈夫有几个妻子，将取决于他的义：他活得越尊贵，所娶的妻就越多。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I had never made my peace with it. As a girl I had often imagined myself in heaven, dressed in a white gown, standing in a pearly mist across from my husband. But when the camera zoomed out there were ten women standing behind us, wearing the same white dress. In my fantasy I was the first wife but I knew there was no guarantee of that; I might be hidden anywhere in the long chain of wives. For as long as I could remember, this image had been at the core of my idea of paradise: my husband, and his wives. There was a sting in this arithmetic: in knowing that in the divine calculus of heaven, one man could balance the equation for countless women.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我从未平心静气地接受这一点。作为一个女孩，我时常想象自己置身天堂，一袭白色长裙，站在一片白雾中，对面是我的丈夫。但是当镜头拉近，我们身后还站着十个女人，穿着同样的白色衣裙。在我的幻想中，我是第一任妻子，但我知道这一点根本无从保证；我可能是长长的妻子链中最不起眼的一个。从我记事起，这个画面就一直居于我对天堂想象的核心：我丈夫和他的妻子们。在这道算术题中，存在一种刺痛：在神圣的天国演算中，一个男人可以为无数的女人平衡等式。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It was her voice that brought our family to the church," Mother said. "She heard Mormon missionaries preaching in the streets of Norway. She prayed, and God blessed her with faith, with the knowledge that Joseph Smith was His prophet. She told her father, but he'd heard stories about the Mormons and wouldn't allow her to be baptized. So she sang for him. She sang him a Mormon hymn called 'O My Father.' When she finished singing, her father had tears in his eyes. He said that any religion with music so beautiful must be the work of God. They were baptized together."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“正是她的声音把我们一家带进了教堂，”母亲说，“她听到摩门教传教士在挪威的街头布道。她祈祷，于是上帝用信仰赐福她，让她知道约瑟夫·史密斯是上帝的先知。她把这告诉了她的父亲，但他听过摩门教的一些故事，不允许她受洗。于是她为他唱歌。她给他唱了一首摩门教赞美诗，名叫‘哦，我的父亲’。她唱完后，她的父亲热泪盈眶。他说，任何拥有如此美妙音乐的宗教必定是上帝的杰作。于是他们一起受洗。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I remembered my great-great-grandmother. I had first heard her name when I was twelve, which is the year that, in Mormonism, you cease to be a child and become a woman. Twelve was the age when lessons in Sunday school began to include words like purity and chastity. It was also the age that I was asked, as part of a church assignment, to learn about one of my ancestors. I asked Mother which ancestor I should choose, and without thinking she said, "Anna Mathea." I said the name aloud. It floated off my tongue like the beginning of a fairy tale. Mother said I should honor Anna Mathea because she had given me a gift: her voice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我想起我的外高祖母。第一次听到她的名字是在我十二岁时。在摩门教中，十二岁意味着你不再是一个孩子，而是变成了一个女人。十二岁时，主日学校的课程也开始包括“纯洁”和“贞节”之类的词汇。也是在这个年龄，作为教会任务的一部分，我被要求去了解我的一位祖先。我问母亲该选择哪一位祖先，她不假思索地说：“安娜·玛西亚。”我大声说出这个名字，它就像童话故事开头一样从我的舌尖飘过。母亲说我应该铭记安娜·玛西亚，因为她留给我一份礼物：她的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The journey was long and harsh, and by the time they made it to Idaho, to a Mormon settlement called Worm Creek, Anna's mother was sick, dying. It was her last wish to see her daughter again, so her father wrote to Anna, begging her to take what money she had and come to America. Anna had fallen in love and was to be married, but she left her fiancé in Norway and crossed the ocean. Her mother died before she reached the American shore.</div>

<div class="line_en">The family was now destitute; there was no money to send Anna to her fiancé, to the marriage she had given up. Anna was a financial burden on her father, so a bishop persuaded her to marry a rich farmer as his second wife. His first wife was barren, and she flew into a jealous rage when Anna became pregnant. Anna worried the first wife might hurt her baby, so she returned to her father, where she gave birth to twins, though only one would survive the harsh winter on the frontier.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此时这家人一贫如洗，没有钱再把安娜送回未婚夫身边，她也就无法履行婚约。安娜成了父亲的经济负担，于是一位主教说服她嫁给一个富农，做他的第二个妻子。他的第一个妻子不能生育，安娜怀孕后，她醋意大发。安娜担心第一个妻子会伤害她的孩子，于是回到她父亲身边，在那里生了一对双胞胎。可是边境冬季严寒，只有一个婴儿活了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>

I said the words, then braced myself for a wave of humiliation -- for that image to invade my thoughts, of me, one of many wives standing behind a solitary, faceless man -- but it didn't come.

I asked. You wouldn't do it, the voice answered. And I knew it was true.</div>

<div class="line_en">We waited for the food, and Dad asked about my classes. I said I was studying French. "That's a socialist language," he said, then he lectured for twenty minutes on twentieth-century history. He said Jewish bankers in Europe had signed secret agreements to start World War II, and that they had colluded with Jews in America to pay for it. They had engineered the Holocaust, he said, because they would benefit financially from worldwide disorder. They had sent their own people to the gas chambers for money.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等候上菜的间隙，父亲问起我的学业。我说我在学习法语。“你竟然学这种语言。”他说，接着讲了二十分钟的二十世纪历史。他说，欧洲的犹太银行家签署秘密协议，发动了第二次世界大战，他们还为了获得经济支持与美国的犹太人串通一气。他说，是他们策划了大屠杀，因为全世界的动荡不安将使他们获得经济利益。为了钱，他们还把自己人送进了毒气室。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">These ideas were familiar to me, but it took me a moment to remember where I'd heard them: in a lecture Dr. Kerry had given on The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. The Protocols, published in 1903, purported to be a record of a secret meeting of powerful Jews planning world domination. The document was discredited as a fabrication but still it spread, fueling anti-Semitism in the decades before World War II. Adolf Hitler had written about the Protocols in Mein Kampf, claiming they were authentic, that they revealed the true nature of the Jewish people.</div>

The mere fact of them had never shocked me before. Everything they did had always made sense to me, adhering to a logic I understood.

<div class="line_en">My interview for the Gates scholarship took place at St. John's College in Annapolis. The campus was intimidating, with its immaculate lawns and crisp colonial architecture. I sat nervously in the corridor, waiting to be called in for my interview; I felt stiff in the pantsuit and clung awkwardly to Robin's handbag. But in the end, Professor Steinberg had written such a powerful letter of recommendation that there was little left for me to do.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="盖茨奖学金的面试是在安纳波利斯的圣约翰学院进行的。校园令人生畏，有完美无瑕的草坪和干净利落的殖民时期风格建筑。我紧张地坐在走廊里，等候被叫去面试；我身着套装，抓着罗宾的手提包，感到笨手笨脚，浑身僵硬。但最终，我几乎没有什么可做的，因为斯坦伯格教授已为我写了一封有力的推荐信。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The phone calls began -- from BYU's student paper and the local news. I did half a dozen interviews. I was on TV. I awoke one morning to find my picture plastered on BYU's home page. I was the third BYU student ever to win a Gates scholarship, and the university was taking full advantage of the press. I was asked about my high school experience, and which of my grade school teachers had prepared me for my success. I dodged, I parried, I lied when I had to. I didn't tell a single reporter that I'd never gone to school.</div>

<div class="line_en">A month before my graduation, I visited Buck's Peak. Dad had read the articles about my scholarship, and what he said was, "You didn't mention home school. I'd think you'd be more grateful that your mother and I took you out of them schools, seeing how it's worked out. You should be telling people that's what done it: home school."</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a dinner the night before my graduation where I was to receive the "most outstanding undergraduate" award from the history department. I waited for my parents at the entrance, but they never appeared. I called Mother, thinking they were running late. She said they weren't coming. I went to the dinner and was presented with a plaque. My table had the only empty seats in the hall. The next day there was a luncheon for honors graduates, and I was seated with the college dean and the director of the honors program. Again, there were two empty seats. I said my parents had had car trouble.</div>
