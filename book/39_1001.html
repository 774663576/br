<div class="line_en">In 1933, the year Baba was born and the year Zahir Shah began his forty-year reign of Afghanistan, two brothers, young men from a wealthy and reputable family in Kabul, got behind the wheel of their father's Ford roadster. High on hashish and "mast" on French wine, they struck and killed a Hazara husband and wife on the road to Paghman. The police brought the somewhat contrite young men and the dead couple's five-year-old orphan boy before my grandfather, who was a highly regarded judge and a man of impeccable reputation. After hearing the brothers' account and their father's plea for mercy, my grandfather ordered the two young men to go to Kandahar at once and enlist in the army for one year -- this despite the fact that their family had somehow managed to obtain them exemptions from the draft. Their father argued, but not too vehemently, and in the end, everyone agreed that the punishment had been perhaps harsh but fair. As for the orphan, my grandfather adopted him into his own household, and told the other servants to tutor him, but to be kind to him. That boy was Ali.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ali and Baba grew up together as childhood playmates -- at least until polio crippled Ali's leg -- just like Hassan and I grew up a generation later. Baba was always telling us about the mischief he and Ali used to cause, and Ali would shake his head and say, "But, Agha sahib, tell them who was the architect of the mischief and who the poor laborer?" Baba would laugh and throw his arm around Ali.</div>

Never mind that we spent entire winters flying kites, running kites.

<div class="line_en">We chased the "Kochi", the nomads who passed through Kabul on their way to the mountains of the north. We would hear their caravans approaching our neighborhood, the mewling of their sheep, the "baaing" of their goats, the jingle of bells around their camels' necks. We'd run outside to watch the caravan plod through our street, men with dusty, weather-beaten faces and women dressed in long, colorful shawls, beads, and silver bracelets around their wrists and ankles. We hurled pebbles at their goats. We squirted water on their mules. I'd make Hassan sit on the Wall of Ailing Corn and fire pebbles with his slingshot at the camels' rears.</div>

<div class="line_en">But we were kids who had learned to crawl together, and no history, ethnicity, society, or religion was going to change that either. I spent most of the first twelve years of my life playing with Hassan. Sometimes, my entire childhood seems like one long lazy summer day with Hassan, chasing each other between tangles of trees in my father's yard, playing hide-and-seek, cops and robbers, cowboys and Indians, insect torture -- with our crowning achievement undeniably the time we plucked the stinger off a bee and tied a string around the poor thing to yank it back every time it took flight.</div>

<div class="line_en">We saw our first Western together, "Rio Bravo" with John Wayne, at the Cinema Park, across the street from my favorite bookstore. I remember begging Baba to take us to Iran so we could meet John Wayne. Baba burst out in gales of his deepthroated laughter -- a sound not unlike a truck engine revving up -- and, when he could talk again, explained to us the concept of voice dubbing. Hassan and I were stunned. Dazed. John Wayne didn't really speak Farsi and he wasn't Iranian! He was American, just like the friendly, longhaired men and women we always saw hanging around in Kabul, dressed in their tattered, brightly colored shirts. We saw "Rio Bravo" three times, but we saw our favorite Western, "The Magnificent Seven", thirteen times. With each viewing, we cried at the end when the Mexican kids buried Charles Bronson -- who, as it turned out, wasn't Iranian either.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们第一次看西部电影也是两个人，在与那家我最喜欢的书店一街之隔的电影院公园，看的是约翰·韦恩的《赤胆屠龙》。我记得当时我求爸爸带我们到伊朗去，那样我们就可以见到约翰·韦恩了。爸爸爆发出一阵爽朗的狂笑——与汽车引擎加速的声音颇为相像，等他能说得出话的时候，告诉我们电影配音是怎么回事。哈桑跟我目瞪口呆，愣住了。原来约翰·韦恩不是真的说法尔西语，也不是伊朗人！他是美国人，就像那些我们经常看到的男男女女一样，他们神情友善，留着长发，吊儿郎当地穿着五颜六色的衣服，在喀布尔城里游荡。我们看了三遍《赤胆屠龙》，但我们最喜欢的西部片是《七侠荡寇志》，看了十三遍。每次电影快结束的时候，我们哭着观看那些墨西哥小孩埋葬查尔斯·勃朗森——结果他也不是伊朗人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We took strolls in the musty-smelling bazaars of the Shar-e-Nau section of Kabul, or the new city, west of the Wazir Akbar Khan district. We talked about whatever film we had just seen and walked amid the bustling crowds of "bazarris". We snaked our way among the merchants and the beggars, wandered through narrow alleys cramped with rows of tiny, tightly packed stalls. Baba gave us each a weekly allowance of ten Afghanis and we spent it on warm Coca-Cola and rosewater ice cream topped with crushed pistachios.</div>

<div class="line_en">During the school year, we had a daily routine. By the time I dragged myself out of bed and lumbered to the bathroom, Hassan had already washed up, prayed the morning "namaz" with Ali, and prepared my breakfast: hot black tea with three sugar cubes and a slice of toasted "naan" topped with my favorite sour cherry marmalade, all neatly placed on the dining table. While I ate and complained about homework, Hassan made my bed, polished my shoes, ironed my outfit for the day, packed my books and pencils. I'd hear him singing to himself in the foyer as he ironed, singing old Hazara songs in his nasal voice. Then, Baba and I drove off in his black Ford Mustang -- a car that drew envious looks everywhere because it was the same car Steve McQueen had driven in "Bullitt", a film that played in one theater for six months. Hassan stayed Home and helped Ali with the day's chores: hand-washing dirty clothes and hanging them to dry in the yard, sweeping the floors, buying fresh "naan" from the bazaar, marinating meat for dinner, watering the lawn.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="上学那些年，我们每日有固定的程式。每当我从床上爬起来，拖拖沓沓走向卫生间，哈桑早已洗漱完毕，跟阿里做完早晨的祈祷，帮我弄好早餐：加了三块方糖的热红茶，一片涂着我最爱吃的樱桃酱的馕饼，所有这些整整齐齐地摆在桌子上。我边吃边抱怨功课，哈桑收拾我的床铺，擦亮我的鞋子，熨好我那天要穿的衣服，替我放好课本和铅笔。我听见他在门廊边熨衣服边唱歌，用他那带鼻音的嗓子唱着古老的哈扎拉歌曲。然后，爸爸和我出发，开着他的福特野马轿车——会引来艳羡的目光，因为当时有部叫《警网铁金刚》的电影在电影院已经上映了半年，主角史蒂夫·麦奎因在影片中就开这种车。哈桑留在家里，帮阿里做些杂务：用手将脏衣服洗干净，然后在院子里晾干；拖地板；去市场买刚出炉的馕饼；给晚餐准备腌肉；浇灌草坪。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After school, Hassan and I met up, grabbed a book, and trotted up a bowl-shaped hill just north of my father's property in Wazir Akbar Khan. There was an old abandoned cemetery atop the hill with rows of unmarked headstones and tangles of brushwood clogging the aisles. Seasons of rain and snow had turned the iron gate rusty and left the cemetery's low white stone walls in decay. There was a pomegranate tree near the entrance to the cemetery. One summer day, I used one of Ali's kitchen knives to carve our names on it: "Amir and Hassan, the sultans of Kabul." Those words made it formal: the tree was ours. After school, Hassan and I climbed its branches and snatched its bloodred pomegranates. After we'd eaten the fruit and wiped our hands on the grass, I would read to Hassan.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="放学后，我跟哈桑碰头，抓起书本，一溜小跑，爬上瓦兹尔·阿克巴·汗区那座就在爸爸房子北边的碗状山丘。山顶有久已废弃的墓园，各条小径灌木丛生，还有成排成排的空白墓碑。多年的风霜雨雪锈蚀了墓园的铁门，也让那低矮的白色石墙摇摇欲坠。墓园的入口边上有株石榴树。某个夏日，我用阿里厨房的小刀在树干刻下我们的名字：“阿米尔和哈桑，喀布尔的苏丹。”这些字正式宣告：这棵树属于我们。放学后，哈桑和我爬上它的枝桠，摘下一些血红色的石榴果实。吃过石榴，用杂草把手擦干净之后，我会念书给哈桑听。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sitting cross-legged, sunlight and shadows of pomegranate leaves dancing on his face, Hassan absently plucked blades of grass from the ground as I read him stories he couldn't read for himself. That Hassan would grow up illiterate like Ali and most Hazaras had been decided the minute he had been born, perhaps even the moment he had been conceived in Sanaubar's unwelcoming womb -- after all, what use did a servant have for the written word? But despite his illiteracy, or maybe because of it, Hassan was drawn to the mystery of words, seduced by a secret world forbidden to him. I read him poems and stories, sometimes riddles -- though I stopped reading those when I saw he was far better at solving them than I was. So I read him unchallenging things, like the misadventures of the bumbling Mullah Nasruddin and his donkey. We sat for hours under that tree, sat there until the sun faded in the west, and still Hassan insisted we had enough daylight for one more story, one more chapter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈桑盘腿坐着，阳光和石榴叶的阴影在他脸上翩翩起舞。我念那些他看不懂的故事给他听，他心不在焉地摘着地上杂草的叶片。哈桑长大后，会跟阿里和多数哈扎拉人一样，自出生之日起，甚至自莎娜芭不情不愿地怀上他那天起，就注定要成为文盲——毕竟，仆人要读书识字干吗呢？但尽管他目不识丁，兴许正因为如此，哈桑对那些谜一样的文字十分入迷，那个他无法接触的世界深深吸引了他。我给他念诗歌和故事，有时也念谜语——不过后来我不念了，因为我发现他解谜语的本领远比我高强。所以我念些不那么有挑战性的东西，比如装腔作势的纳斯鲁丁毛拉和他那头驴子出洋相的故事。我们在树下一坐就是几个钟头，直到太阳在西边黯淡下去，哈桑还会说，日光还足够亮堂，我们可以多念一个故事、多读一章。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Hassan's favorite book by far was the _Shahnamah_, the tenth-century epic of ancient Persian heroes. He liked all of the chapters, the shahs of old, Feridoun, Zal, and Rudabeh. But his favorite story, and mine, was "Rostam and Sohrab," the tale of the great warrior Rostam and his fleet-footed horse, Rakhsh.

<div class="line_en">"Read it again please, Amir agha," Hassan would say. Sometimes tears pooled in Hassan's eyes as I read him this passage, and I always wondered whom he wept for, the grief-stricken Rostam who tears his clothes and covers his head with ashes, or the dying Sohrab who only longed for his father's love? Personally, I couldn't see the tragedy in Rostam's fate. After all, didn't all fathers in their secret hearts harbor a desire to kill their sons?</div>

<div class="line_en">One day, in July 1973, I played another little trick on Hassan. I was reading to him, and suddenly I strayed from the written story. I pretended I was reading from the book, flipping pages regularly, but I had abandoned the text altogether, taken over the story, and made up my own. Hassan, of course, was oblivious to this. To him, the words on the page were a scramble of codes, indecipherable, mysterious. Words were secret doorways and I held all the keys. After, I started to ask him if he'd liked the story, a giggle rising in my throat, when Hassan began to clap.</div>

<div class="line_en">That same night, I wrote my first short story. It took me thirty minutes. It was a dark little tale about a man who found a magic cup and learned that if he wept into the cup, his tears turned into pearls. But even though he had always been poor, he was a happy man and rarely shed a tear. So he found ways to make himself sad so that his tears could make him rich. As the pearls piled up, so did his greed grow. The story ended with the man sitting on a mountain of pearls, knife in hand, weeping helplessly into the cup with his beloved wife's slain body in his arms.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当天夜里，我写了自己第一篇短篇小说，花了我半个小时。那是个悲伤的小故事，讲的是有个男人发现了一个魔法杯，得知如果他对着杯子哭泣，掉进杯里的眼泪会变成珍珠。可尽管一贫如洗，他却是个快乐的家伙，罕得流泪。于是他想方设法，让自己悲伤，以便那些眼泪会变成他的财富。珍珠越积越多，他越来越贪婪。小说的结尾是，那男人坐在一座珠宝山上，手里提着刀，怀中抱着他深爱着的妻子死于非命的尸体，无助地将眼泪滴进魔法杯。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Baba nodded and gave a thin smile that conveyed little more than feigned interest. "Well, that's very good, isn't it?" he said. Then nothing more. He just looked at me through the cloud of smoke.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“那是什么，阿米尔？”爸爸说，他斜靠在沙发上，双手放在脑后。蓝色的烟雾环绕着他的脸庞，他的眼光让我唇干舌燥。我清清喉咙，告诉他我创作了一篇小说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That evening, I climbed the stairs and walked into Baba's smoking room, in my hands the two sheets of paper on which I had scribbled the story. Baba and Rahim Khan were smoking pipes and sipping brandy when I came in.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="一如既往，仍是拉辛汗救了我。他伸出手，给我一个毫不造作的微笑：“可以让我看看吗，亲爱的阿米尔？我会很高兴能读你写的故事。”爸爸称呼我的时候，几乎从来不用这个表示亲昵的“亲爱的”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I probably stood there for under a minute, but, to this day, it was one of the longest minutes of my life. Seconds plodded by, each separated from the next by an eternity.

<div class="line_en">An hour later, as the evening sky dimmed, the two of them drove off in my father's car to attend a party. On his way out, Rahim Khan hunkered before me and handed me my story and another folded piece of paper. He flashed a smile and winked. "For you. Read it later." Then he paused and added a single word that did more to encourage me to pursue writing than any compliment any editor has ever paid me. That word was "Bravo".</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过了一个钟头，夜色更加黯淡了。他们两个开着爸爸的轿车去参加派对。拉辛汗快出门的时候，在我身前蹲下来，递给我那篇故事，还有另外一张折好的纸。他亮起微笑，还眨眨眼。“给你，等会再看。”然后他停下来，加了一个词：太棒了！就鼓励我写作而言，这个词比如今任何编辑的恭维给了我更多的勇气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Baba shrugged and stood up. He looked relieved, as if he too had been rescued by Rahim Khan. "Yes, give it to Kaka Rahim. I'm going upstairs to get ready." And with that, he left the room. Most days I worshiped Baba with an intensity approaching the religious. But right then, I wished I could open my veins and drain his cursed blood from my body.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爸爸耸耸肩，站起来。他看上去浑身轻松，仿佛拉辛汗也解放了他。“这就对了，把它给拉辛汗。我要上楼去准备了。”他扔下这句话，转身离开。在我生命的大部分时光，我对爸爸敬若神明。可是那一刻，我恨不得能扯开自己的血管，让他那些该死的血统统流出我的身体。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When they left, I sat on my bed and wished Rahim Khan had been my father. Then I thought of Baba and his great big chest and how good it felt when he held me against it, how he smelled of Brut in the morning, and how his beard tickled my face. I was overcome with such sudden guilt that I bolted to the bathroom and vomited in the sink.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们离开了，我坐在自己的床上，心里想要是拉辛汗是我父亲就好了。随后我想起爸爸，还有他宽广的胸膛，他抱着我的时候，靠着它感觉多好啊。我想起每天早晨他身上甜甜的酒味，想起他用胡子扎我的脸蛋。一阵突如其来的罪恶感将我淹没，我跑进卫生间，在水槽里吐了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I enjoyed your story very much. "Mashallah", God has granted you a special talent. It is now your duty to hone that talent, because a person who wastes his God-given talents is a donkey. You have written your story with sound grammar and interesting style. But the most impressive thing about your story is that it has irony. You may not even know what that word means. But you will someday. It is something that some writers reach for their entire careers and never attain. You have achieved it with your first story.</div>
