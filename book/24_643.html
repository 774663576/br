<div class="line_en">There came the time when the world of Jeffrey's dreams was no longer sharply divided from his everyday existence. He no longer went to school, and for Jean and George also the routine of life was completely broken, as it was soon to break down throughout the world.</div>

<div class="line_en">They avoided all their friends, as if already conscious that soon no one would have sympathy to spare for them. Sometimes, in the quietness of the night when there were few people about, they would go for long walks together. They were closer now than they had been since the first days of their marriage, united again in the face of the still unknown tragedy that soon would overwhelm them. At first it had given them a feeling of guilt to leave the sleeping children alone in the house, but now they realized that Jeff and Jenny could look after themselves in ways beyond the knowledge of their parents. And, of course, the Overlords would be watching too. That thought was reassuring: they felt that they were not alone with their problem, but that wise and sympathetic eyes shared their vigil.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was no need to do so. The entity that had been Jennifer Anne Greggson was not yet fully developed, but even in its sleeping chrysalis state it already had enough control of its environment to take care of all its needs. Jean had only once attempted to feed it, without success. It chose to take nourishment in its own time, and in its own manner. For food vanished from the freezer in a slow, steady stream: yet Jennifer Anne never moved from her cot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="实际上她也没有必要进去。那个小家伙，就是在这种蝶蛹般的睡眠状态下，也知道利用周围的一切来满足自己的种种需要。简曾试着给她喂饭，她不吃，她喜欢按自己的时间以自己的方式补充营养。冰箱里的食物慢慢地、持续不断地在消失，而她依然躺在摇床上一动不动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jennifer slept: there was no other word to describe the state she had entered. To all outward appearances, she was still a baby, but round her now was a sense of latent power so terrifying that Jean could no longer bear to enter the nursery.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="詹妮“睡着”了（实在找不到别的词来形容她所进入的状态），从外表上看，她还是婴儿，但她潜在的能力太可怕了，简几乎不敢走进儿童房。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The rattling had ceased, and the discarded toy lay on the nursery floor where no one dared to touch it, lest Jennifer Anne might need it again. Sometimes she caused the furniture to stir itself into peculiar patterns, and it seemed to George that the fluoro-paint on the wall was glowing more brilliantly than it had ever done before.</div>

<div class="line_en">He was changing too, but he still knew them. The boy whose growth they had watched from the formless mists of babyhood was losing his personality, dissolving hour by hour before their very eyes. Yet sometimes he still spoke to them as he had always done, and talked of his toys and friends as if unconscious of what lay ahead. But much of the time he did not see them, or show any awareness of their presence. He no longer slept, as they were forced to do, despite their overwhelming need to waste as few as possible of these last remaining hours.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰弗也在变，但还认识他们，这个他们从小看着长大的孩子正在迷失自己，一个又一个小时，他变得越来越陌生。有时他也和以前一样跟他们谈玩具，谈朋友，好像不知道将来会发生什么，但绝大多数时候他都对他们视而不见，或者根本就没有意识到他们的存在。他不再睡觉，尽管简和乔治不愿浪费所剩不多的时间中的几个小时去睡觉，但他们实在支撑不住。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Unlike Jenny, he seemed to possess no abnormal powers over physical objects -- perhaps because, being already partly grown, he had less need for them. His strangeness was entirely in his mental life, of which the dreams were now only a small part. He would stay quite still for hours on end, his eyes tightly closed, as if listening to sounds which no one else could hear. Into his mind was flooding knowledge -- from somewhere or somewhen -- which soon would overwhelm and destroy the half-formed creature who had been Jeffrey Angus Greggson.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="和詹妮不同的是，杰弗对周围的物品没有任何特异功能，也许他年龄大些，不需要那些东西。他的奇怪之处是思想上的，梦境现在只占了其中很小一部分。他静静地一坐就是几个小时，双目紧闭，好像在倾听其他人无法听到的什么声音，无数信息从不同时间、不同地点涌入他的头脑中，很快，这个未成年的孩子就要承受不了，就要崩溃了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She gave no trouble; she was beyond their assistance, and beyond their love. It could not last much longer, and in the time that was left they clung desperately to Jeff.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jeff and Jenny had been the first in all the world, but soon they were no longer alone. Like an epidemic spreading swiftly from land to land, the metamorphosis infected the entire human race. It touched practically no one above the age of ten, and practically no one below that age escaped.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was the end of civilization, the end of all that men had striven for since the beginning of time. In the space of a few days, humanity had lost its future, for the heart of any race is destroyed, and its will to survive is utterly broken, when its children are taken from it.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was no panic, as there would have been a century before. The world was numbed, the great cities stilled and silent. Only the vital industries continued to function. It was as though the planet was in mourning, lamenting all that now could never be.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果在一百年前，人们肯定会惊慌失措，但现在，整个世界都麻木了，所有大城市都静悄悄的，没有任何动静，只有各大工厂还在继续生产。整个地球似乎在默默哀悼那些已经变得不可能的一切。">查看中文翻译</div>
