<div class="line_en">The doorbell at 1238 Coldwater Canyon Drive in Beverly Hills rang at 10:15 a. m. on Saturday, October 29, 2011. The gated one-story Italian villa shrouded by palm trees belonged to Richard and Lorraine Fuisz. The couple had purchased it two years earlier to live closer to their children, who had both moved from Washington, D. C., to Los Angeles after graduating from Georgetown University.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="二〇一一年十月二十九日上午十点十五分，比佛利山冷水峡谷街（Coldwater Canyon Drive）一二三八号的门铃响起，这栋覆盖于棕榈树下、大门深锁的一层楼义式别墅，属于理查．傅伊兹夫妇所有。他们两年前购入，为了住在离孩子比较近的地方，两个小孩从乔治城大学（Georgetown University）毕业后都从华盛顿特区搬到洛杉矶。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Richard Fuisz opened the door, a process server tried to hand him a stack of legal papers. "I'm here to serve a lawsuit on Fuisz Technologies," the man said.</div>

<div class="line_en">Fuisz told him he couldn't accept service because the company, though it bore his name, was no longer his. He had sold it more than a decade earlier. It was now part of Canadian drugmaker Valeant Pharmaceuticals, he explained. The man placed a call and repeated what Fuisz had said. The response, conveyed by someone shouting on the other end of the line, was that he was at the right address and to just serve the papers. But Fuisz continued to refuse to take them. Losing his patience, the process server threw them at his feet and left. Fuisz took out his cell phone and snapped a photo of the pile scattered across the sidewalk. He knew very well what this was about. As a codefendant in the lawsuit, he'd been personally served with a similar set of papers two days earlier. After mulling things over for a minute, he crouched down and picked up the mess. He decided he didn't want the neighbors to see it.</div>

<div class="line_en">Fuisz and his sons were angered by the suit, but they weren't overly worried about it at first. They were confident in the knowledge that its allegations were false. The first and only time Fuisz had brought up Elizabeth Holmes's startup with John was in an email he had sent his son in July 2006 with a link to a Theranos patent application he'd spotted in the patent office's public database. The email, which was sent more than two months after Fuisz filed his own provisional patent, asked if John knew who at McDermott had worked on the Theranos application. John replied that McDermott was a large firm and that he had no idea. The exchange had scarcely registered with John. More than five years later, he had no memory of it. As far as he was concerned, this lawsuit was the first time he'd seen or heard the word "Theranos."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="傅伊兹和两个儿子对这起官司很生气，但一开始并不过于担心，他们很确定那是不实指控。傅伊兹第一次也是唯一一次向约翰提到伊莉莎白．霍姆斯的新创公司，是在二〇〇六年七月他寄给儿子的电邮中，里面附有Theranos一项专利申请的网页链接，是他在专利局公开数据库看到的。那封信的寄出日期，比傅伊兹提出自己的专利申请晚了两个多月，信里询问约翰是否知道McDermott事务所处理Theranos专利申请的人是谁，约翰回复说McDermott是家大型事务所，他不知道是谁经手。约翰对这封电邮往来几乎没有印象，时间过了六年，更是完全不复记忆，对他来说，这起官司是他第一次看到、听到Theranos这个字。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The lawsuit had been filed by Theranos in federal court in San Francisco. It alleged that he had conspired with Joe and John Fuisz, his sons from his first marriage, to steal confidential patent information from the company and used it to file his own rival patent. The theft, the suit alleged, had been carried out by John on behalf of his father while he was employed at Theranos's former patent counsel, McDermott Will &amp; Emery.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这起诉讼是Theranos向旧金山联邦法院提起，指控他和乔．傅伊兹、约翰．傅伊兹（他第一段婚姻的两个儿子）共谋窃取Theranos机密专利数据，并拿去申请专利与Theranos竞争。诉讼书上指控，约翰任职于Theranos以前的专利律师事务所McDermott Will &amp; Emery（以下称McDermott）期间，替父亲窃取该数据。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The top of the complaint's first page showed that Theranos had hired the famous lawyer David Boies to represent it. However, as renowned as Boies was, someone at his firm had fumbled their research and named the wrong Fuisz company. It was Fuisz Pharma, Richard and Joe's new firm -- not Fuisz Technologies -- that the patent in question had been assigned to. Fuisz had refused service because he wanted to make Boies sweat his mistake.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="控告书第一页最上方显示，Theranos聘请了知名律师大卫．波伊斯（David Boies）代表它。不过，波伊斯如此鼎鼎大名，他事务所人员的研究工作竟然做得七零八落，连傅伊兹的公司名字都搞错。理查和乔的新公司是傅伊兹制药（Fuisz Pharma），现在有争议的专利权就是以这个公司名字申请，不是傅伊兹科技公司。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Moreover, Richard and John Fuisz weren't close. John thought his father was an overbearing megalomaniac and tried to keep their interactions to a bare minimum. In 2004, he'd even dropped him as a McDermott client because he was being difficult and slow to pay his bills. The notion that John had willingly jeopardized his legal career to steal information for his father betrayed a fundamental misunderstanding of their frosty relationship.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="更何况，理查和约翰父子并不亲。约翰觉得父亲是个傲慢自大狂，一直尽可能减少两人的交互往来，二〇〇四年甚至把父亲从McDermott的客户名单除名，因为他难搞、付款又拖拖拉拉。如果认为约翰会愿意危及自己的律师生涯而替父亲偷窃数据，是完全不了解这对父子冷若冰霜的关系。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">John had no reason to wish Elizabeth or her family ill; on the contrary. When he was in his early twenties, Chris Holmes had written him a letter of recommendation that helped him gain admission to Catholic University's law school. Later, John's first wife had gotten to know Noel Holmes through Lorraine Fuisz and become friendly with her. Noel had even dropped by their house when John's first son was born to bring the baby a gift.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="约翰没有理由希望伊莉莎白或她的家人过得不好。他二十岁出头时，伊莉莎白的爸爸帮他写了封推荐信，帮助他取得天主教大学（Catholic University）法学院入学许可。后来，约翰第一任太太因为婆婆的关系认识伊莉莎白的妈妈诺儿，结为好友，约翰的大儿子出生时，诺儿甚至带礼物到他们家送给小婴儿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But Elizabeth was understandably furious at Richard Fuisz. The patent application he had filed in April 2006 had matured into U. S. Patent 7,824,612 in November 2010 and now stood in the way of her vision of putting the Theranos device in people's homes. If that vision was someday realized, she would have to license the bar code mechanism Fuisz had thought up to alert doctors to patients' abnormal blood-test results. Fuisz had rubbed that fact in her face the day his patent was issued by sending a Fuisz Pharma press release to info@theranos. com, the email address the company provided on its website for general queries. Rather than give in to what she saw as blackmail, Elizabeth had decided to steamroll her old neighbor by hiring one of the country's best and most feared attorneys to go after him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，伊莉莎白会对理查．傅伊兹这么抓狂，倒是可以理解。傅伊兹二〇〇六年四月申请的专利，在二〇一〇年十一月正式成立，专利编号为七八二四六一二，这下他阻挡了伊莉莎白想把Theranos设备放入大众家中的愿景。如果那个愿景有朝一日成真，她就得取得傅伊兹的条码机制授权，才能向医师警示病人的检测结果异常。专利正式成立那天，傅伊兹还故意寄了傅伊兹制药公司的新闻稿到info@theranos.com（Theranos放在网站供人询问的电邮地址）耀武扬威。伊莉莎白不愿屈服于这种「勒索」，她决定把这个老邻居碾压个粉碎，聘请美国最厉害、最可怕的律师缉拿他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">David Boies's legend preceded him. He had risen to national prominence in the 1990s when the Justice Department hired him to handle its antitrust suit against Microsoft. On his way to a resounding courtroom victory, Boies had grilled Bill Gates for twenty hours in a videotaped deposition that proved devastating to the software giant's defense. He had gone on to represent Al Gore before the Supreme Court during the contested 2000 presidential election, cementing his status as a legal celebrity. More recently, he'd successfully led the charge to overturn Proposition 8, California's ban on gay marriage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大卫．波伊斯的传奇故事比他本人还有名。他在一九九〇年代声名鹊起，成为全国性人物，当时司法部聘请他向微软提起反托拉斯诉讼。在他迈向一场轰动美国的法庭胜利中，波伊斯在录像作证中拷问了比尔．盖兹长达二十小时，彻底瓦解这位软件巨人的防卫。接着，二〇〇〇年竞争激烈的总统大选中，他代表艾尔．高尔（Al Gore）走进最高法院，他的法律名人地位随之确立。更晚近一点，他成功带头推翻了加州禁止同性婚姻的「八号提案」（Proposition 8）。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Boies was a master litigator who could be ruthless when he felt the situation required it. In one case that illustrated his no-holds-barred ethos, he had escalated a business dispute between a client and the owner of a small Palm Beach lawn-care company into a federal racketeering lawsuit in which he'd accused the man and three of his gardeners of conspiracy, fraud, extortion, and -- last but not least -- violating antitrust law. After a judge in Miami dismissed the suit, Boies appealed the verdict to the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit in Atlanta. Only after that appeal failed did he drop the case.</div>

<div class="line_en">Boies's law firm, Boies, Schiller &amp; Flexner, had gained a reputation for aggressive tactics. It didn't take the Fuiszes long to find out why. In the weeks before Theranos sued, all three had picked up clues that they were under surveillance. Richard Fuisz noticed a car tailing him when he drove to Van Nuys Airport to board a flight to Las Vegas. Joe, who lived in Miami, was warned by his neighbor, a retired cop who acted like his block's self-appointed captain, that someone was watching his house. John and his wife spotted a man taking pictures of their home in Georgetown. The Fuiszes now felt sure those had been private investigators hired by Boies.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="波伊斯隶属的法律事务所Boies， Schiller &amp; Flexner（以下称BSF），以手段激进闻名，傅伊兹一家不用多久就明白个中原因。Theranos提起告诉前的几个星期，傅伊兹父子三人都发现自己被监视的蛛丝马迹。理查．傅伊兹开车到凡奈斯机场（Van Nuys Airport）搭机前往拉斯维加斯，发现有车子尾随；住在迈阿密的乔则是有邻居警告他（邻居是退休警察，自认为是邻里一带的队长），有人在监视他家；约翰和太太则发现，有个男子在拍摄他们乔治城住家的照片。现在，傅伊兹父子已经确定那些是波伊斯雇用的私家侦探。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The surveillance continued after the suit was filed and unnerved Fuisz's wife, Lorraine. Cars were frequently parked across the street from their Beverly Hills house, a driver sitting idle inside. One day, Lorraine noticed that the person behind the wheel was a blond woman and became convinced that it was her old friend, Noel Holmes. Fuisz thought that was unlikely but grabbed his camera and a telephoto lens and took a picture of the car, a gray Toyota Camry, from inside the house. He then walked outside to confront the driver. As he approached the car, it sped off. When he later took a closer look at the photo, he couldn't make out the woman's face well enough to rule Noel out. That upset Lorraine even more. She felt sure the Holmeses were out to bankrupt them and take possession of their house. She became nearly hysterical.</div>

<div class="line_en">Two months after Theranos filed its lawsuit, Keker &amp; Van Nest, the law firm John Fuisz hired to defend him, sent Boies several documents that went a long way toward disproving Theranos's accusations. One of them was a declaration by Brian McCauley, McDermott's records manager, stating that a thorough search of the firm's records management and email systems had shown that neither John nor his secretary had ever accessed any Theranos files. Attached to the declaration were exhibits showing all the steps McCauley had taken to arrive at his conclusion. But in a response five days later, Boies dismissed the documents as "self serving" and "not… very persuasive."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="Theranos提出告诉两个月后，约翰．傅伊兹聘请的Keker &amp; Van Nest法律事务所寄给波伊斯好几份文档，对于反驳Theranos的指控很有帮助。其中一份是McDermott文件经理布莱恩．麦考利（Brian McCauley）的声明，说明他们彻底调查了McDermott的文件管理和电邮系统，没有迹象显示约翰或其秘书曾经取用任何Theranos文件，声明还附上各项物证，说明麦考利采取了哪些步骤才做成此项结论。不过，波伊斯五天后在回信中将那些文档斥为「只是利己陈述」、「说服力薄弱」。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Boies's use of private investigators wasn't just an intimidation tactic, it was the product of a singular paranoia that shaped Elizabeth and Sunny's view of the world. That paranoia centered on the belief that the lab industry's two dominant players, Quest Diagnostics and Laboratory Corporation of America, would stop at nothing to undermine Theranos and its technology. When Boies had first been approached about representing Theranos by Larry Ellison and another investor, it was that overarching concern that had been communicated to him. In other words, Boies's assignment wasn't just to sue Fuisz, it was to investigate whether he was in league with Quest and LabCorp. The reality was that Theranos was on neither company's radar at that stage and that, as colorful and filled with intrigue as Fuisz's life had been, he had no connection to them whatsoever.</div>

<div class="line_en">In 1992, when John was fresh out of law school, he had acted as a courier between his father and a college friend who worked at the law firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &amp; Flom. The college friend had given John a stack of Skadden billing documents to pass on to his dad. At the time, Richard Fuisz was in a legal battle with a Skadden client, the heavy-equipment maker Terex Corporation, which had sued him for libel for telling a congressional committee that it sold Scud missile launchers to Iraq. Even though the incident was twenty years old and the libel suit had been settled without any court finding that John had done anything wrong, Boies intended to use it to suggest he had a history of funneling stolen information to his father.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was something else Boies planned to exploit that was both more recent and potentially more damaging: McDermott had forced John to resign in 2009 after he clashed with the firm's brass in an unrelated matter. The cause of the dispute had been John's insistence that the firm withdraw its reliance on a forged document in a case before the International Trade Commission in which McDermott was representing a Chinese state-owned company against the U. S. government's Office of Unfair Import Investigations. McDermott's leadership had agreed to withdraw the document, but the move had severely weakened the Chinese client's defense and angered the firm's senior partners. The firm had subsequently asked John to leave, citing a list of other incidents that it said showed a pattern of behavior unbecoming of a partner. One of the reasons cited was a complaint a client had made about John. At the time, the firm had refused to tell John who the client was or what the complaint was about, but he now figured it must have been Elizabeth's September 2008 complaint to Chuck Work about his father's patent.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="波伊斯打算好好利用的数据中，有些较为近期，杀伤力也可能比较大：McDermott曾在二〇〇九年强迫约翰辞职，因为他在一起不相关的事件上跟事务所不同调。事件起因是，约翰坚持事务所在国际贸易委员会（USITC）一起诉讼中，应该撤回一份伪造文档。该起诉讼中，McDermott代表中国一家国营企业，对抗美国政府的「不公平进口调查室」（OUII），McDermott领导阶层同意撤回那份文档，但此举严重削弱中国客户的辩护力，激怒了McDermott资深合伙人。随后McDermott要求约翰辞职，列出多起事件做为他不适任合伙人的证明，其中所列的理由之一是有客户投诉他，当时McDermott拒绝告诉约翰投诉者是谁、投诉内容为何，但是现在他猜想一定是二〇〇八年九月伊莉莎白向恰克．沃克投诉他父亲专利那一次。">查看中文翻译</div>

By the time Boies Schiller attorneys deposed John in the spring of 2013, his anger was made rawer by another source of stress: his wife, Amanda, had been diagnosed with a vasa previa, a complication of pregnancy in which the fetus's blood vessels are exposed and at risk of rupture. She and John were in anxious limbo until the baby reached thirty-four weeks and doctors could deliver her and place her in the neonatal intensive care unit.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随着诉讼拖到秋天，约翰一开始对官司的不快也演变成对伊莉莎白的盛怒。离开McDermott后，他自己成立事务所执业，Theranos的案子和指控害他失去好几位客户，手上两件案子的交手律师也引用Theranos案件抹黑他。二〇一三年春天，BSF事务所的律师要求他出庭作证时，他的怒气因为另一个压力而更加生猛：太太雅曼达（Amanda）诊断出血管前置（vasa previa，一种怀孕并发症，胎儿的血管外露，有破裂危险）。她和约翰一直处于焦虑状态，直到胎儿长到三十四周、可以接生放入新生儿加护病房。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Boies's strategy of painting John Fuisz in a bad light was dealt a setback in June 2012 when the judge overseeing the case dismissed all the claims against John on the grounds that California's one-year statute of limitations for legal malpractice had expired. Boies turned around and sued McDermott in state court in Washington, D. C., but that suit was soon dismissed when the court ruled that Theranos's allegations against John and the firm were completely speculative. "Simply because attorneys within the firm had access [to the Theranos documents] does not mean the firm did not maintain confidentiality," the judge wrote.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="波伊斯试图把约翰．傅伊兹描绘成坏人的策略，在二〇一二年六月踢到铁板，因为那些对约翰不利的主张都被主审法官驳回，理由是加州对律师不当执业的一年追诉期已过。接着，波伊斯反手把McDermott告上华盛顿特区地方法院，不过很快就被驳回，法院裁定Theranos对约翰和McDermott事务所的指控纯属臆测，「不能只因为律师在这家事务所工作有管道（取得Theranos文档），就认定该事务所未尽到保密之责，」法官写道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Even in the best of times, John had a short fuse. Growing up, he often got into fights with other boys. Under the questioning of one of Boies's partners that day, he became combative and ornery, using foul language and letting his temper flare. At the end of the six-and-a-half-hour deposition, he made a threat that played right into Boies's hands. Asked by one of his father's lawyers whether the case had caused him reputational harm and, if so, whether that had affected his demeanor during the deposition, he responded:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="即使在最好的状态，约翰也是个十分易怒的人，从小到大常跟其他男生打架。那天在法庭上接受波伊斯一位合伙律师质问时，他斗志满点又暴躁易怒，不仅出口成脏，脾气也大爆发。长达六个半小时作证的最后，他语出威胁，正中波伊斯下怀。他父亲的律师问他，这起官司是否造成其名誉受损，如果有，是不是也影响到他这次在法庭上的行为举止，他回答：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Absolutely, I am more than pissed off at these people. I intend to seek my revenge and sue the fuck out of them when this is over, and you can guarantee I will not let Elizabeth Holmes have another fucking company as long as she lives. I will use my ability to file patents and fuck with her till she dies, absolutely.</div>

<div class="line_en">While John Fuisz's anger was boiling over, his father and brother were becoming concerned with how expensive the litigation was getting. They had hired the Los Angeles law firm Kendall Brill &amp; Klieger to represent them at a cost of about $150,000 a month. Laura Brill, the partner who was handling their case, wanted to file an anti-SLAPP motion to try to get the Theranos suit thrown out as frivolous, which would have cost an additional $500,000 with little assurance that it would succeed. They decided to switch to a smaller and less expensive Northern California firm called Banie &amp; Ishimoto and hired the George Washington University Law School professor Stephen Saltzburg, who had done legal work for Fuisz in the past, to oversee its work.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="约翰．傅伊兹怒气沸腾的同时，他的父亲和弟弟愈来愈担心这起官司的花费。他们聘请了洛杉矶法律事务所Kendall Brill &amp; Klieger，代价是一个月十五万美元左右，经手此案的合伙律师萝拉．布莉尔（Laura Brill）想提出「反策略性诉讼动议」（anti-SLAPP；译按：SLAPP是一种策略性诉讼，目的是以庞大诉讼费用恫吓批评者，使其放弃对抗），意图让这起诉讼看似很无谓，但得另外花费五十万美元，而且不保证成功。父子俩决定改聘规模较小、没那么贵的北加州事务所Banie &amp; Ishimoto，同时聘请乔治华盛顿大学（George Washington University）法学院教授史蒂芬．萨兹伯格（Stephen Saltzburg，傅伊兹以前的法律工作都由他经手）监督事务所的处理。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It wasn't the first time Boies had worked out an alternative fee arrangement with a client and taken stock for payment. During the dot-com boom, he had accepted shares to represent WebMD, the website that provides medical information to consumers. Boies had a venture capitalist's approach to cases and figured he and his firm stood to earn a lot more money by getting paid in stock. But it also meant he had a vested financial interest in Theranos that made him more than just its legal advocate. It helped explain why, in early 2013, Boies began attending all of the company's board meetings.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这不是波伊斯第一次向客户采取另类收费方式，以股票付款。互联网泡沫年代，他曾经收取股票替WebMD（提供医疗消息给消费者的网站）打官司，他把自己当成创投来接案，盘算长期来看收取股票可让他和事务所赚更多。不过这也代表他在Theranos拥有财务利益，不只是Theranos的律师，这也是为什么二〇一三年初波伊斯开始出席Theranos每次董事会。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On the other side, they knew they were up against one of the most expensive lawyers in the world. Boies charged clients nearly a thousand dollars an hour and was reputed to earn more than $10 million a year. What they didn't know, however, was that in this instance he had accepted stock in lieu of his regular fees. Elizabeth had granted his firm 300,000 Theranos shares at a price of $15 a share, which put a sticker price of $4.5 million on Boies's services.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="另外一边，傅伊兹父子知道他们对抗的是全世界最昂贵的律师之一。波伊斯向客户收取一小时将近一千美元的报酬，据说年收入超过一千万美元。不过，父子俩不知道的是，这次波伊斯以股票取代收费，伊莉莎白给他的事务所三十万股Theranos股份，一股十五美元，算起来波伊斯的服务要价四百五十万美元。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As the two sides prepared for trial, Fuisz noticed one name that appeared as a co-inventor on many of Elizabeth's patents: Ian Gibbons. With a little research, he learned a few basic facts about the man. Gibbons was a Brit who had a Ph. D. in biochemistry from the University of Cambridge, and he was credited as an inventor on some fifty U. S. patents, including nineteen stemming from his work at a company called Biotrack Laboratories in the 1980s and 1990s.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两造双方为审判做准备时，傅伊兹注意到，伊莉莎白很多专利都有一个名字挂名共同发明人：伊恩．吉本斯（Ian Gibbons）。做了点研究后，他知道这个人的一些基本数据。吉本斯是英国人，有剑桥大学生物化学博士学位，在大约五十个美国专利挂名发明人，其中有十九件是他一九八〇、一九九〇年代在生物轨迹实验室（Biotrack Laboratories）工作时的发明。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Fuisz presumed that Gibbons was a legitimate scientist and that, like most scientists, he was an honest person. If he could get him to admit under oath that there was nothing in his patent that borrowed from, or was similar to, Elizabeth's early patent applications, it would deal a big blow to Theranos's case. He and Joe had also noticed that some of Gibbons's Biotrack patents were similar to the Theranos ones, opening the company up to charges that it had improperly recycled some of his past work. They added Gibbons's name to the list of witnesses they wanted to depose. But then something strange happened: over the next five weeks, the Boies Schiller attorneys kept ignoring their request to schedule Gibbons's deposition. Suspicious, the Fuiszes asked their lawyers to press the matter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="傅伊兹推测他是个正统科学家，跟大多数科学家一样是诚实的人，如果可以请他在法庭宣誓作证，承认他的专利没有取自或类似伊莉莎白早期专利申请之处，将会重击Theranos。他和乔也注意到，吉本斯在「生物轨迹」时代的部分专利跟Theranos的专利很类似，这可能是可以指控Theranos的地方，指控它不当再利用吉本斯过去的发明。他们把吉本斯加进想传唤的证人名单中，不过发生了奇怪的事：接下来五个星期，BSF的律师群持续不理会他们传唤吉本斯出庭的请求，心生疑窦的傅伊兹父子请律师去催一下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Even though Elizabeth's name was on all of Theranos's patents, Richard Fuisz was highly skeptical that a college dropout with no medical or scientific training had done much real inventing. What was more likely, he thought, was that other employees with advanced degrees had done the work she'd patented.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然，Theranos所有专利都有伊莉莎白挂名，但理查．傅伊兹非常怀疑没有医学或科学训练的大学中辍生，能有什么货真价实的发明，他心里猜想，比较可能的情况是，她那些专利其实出自其他学历更高的员工。">查看中文翻译</div>
