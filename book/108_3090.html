<div class="line_en">Ove gives her the plants. Two of them. Of course, there weren't supposed to be two of them. But somewhere along the line there has to be a limit. It was a question of principle, Ove explains to her. That's why he got two flowers in the end.</div>

<div class="line_en">They said on the news there wouldn't be snow, but, as Ove often points out, whatever they predict is bound not to happen. He tells her this; she doesn't answer. He puts his hands in his pockets and gives her a brief nod.</div>

<div class="line_en">He nods and kicks the ground again. He can't understand people who long to retire. How can anyone spend their whole life longing for the day when they become superfluous? Wandering about, a burden on society, what sort of man would ever wish for that? Staying at home, waiting to die. Or even worse: waiting for them to come and fetch you and put you in a home. Being dependent on other people to get to the toilet. Ove can't think of anything worse. His wife often teases him, says he's the only man she knows who'd rather be laid out in a coffin than travel in a mobility service van. And she may have a point there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他点点头，又踹了一脚泥土。他无法理解那些说自己想要退休的人。怎么能整天盼着自己成为多余的人？作为社会的负担四处游荡，什么人会有这样的梦想？回家只能等死。或者更糟糕：等他们来接你去那些不能自理的人住的地方。欧维都不敢再往下想。上个厕所都得别人插手。欧维的太太从前总是逗他说，要是来那么一场葬礼，他是她认识的人中唯一宁可躺在棺材里都不愿意被人推着去参加的那个。也不是完全没有道理。可能吧。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ove had risen at quarter to six. Made coffee for his wife and himself, went around checking the radiators to make sure she hadn't sneakily turned them up. They were all unchanged from yesterday, but he turned them down a little more just to be on the safe side. Then he took his jacket from the hook in the hall, the only hook of all six that wasn't burgeoning with her clothes, and set off for his inspection. It had started getting cold, he noticed. Almost time to change his navy autumn jacket for his navy winter jacket.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维在差一刻到六点的时候起床。给他的太太和自己沏上咖啡。四处检查暖气片，确认太太没有悄悄把它们又打开。它们当然都和昨天完全一样，但他还是把它们的旋钮又调低了一挡。以防万一。客厅里，仅剩六个挂钩没挂她的衣服，他从其中一个钩子上取下自己的外套，出门巡逻。记录车牌号，检查车库门。他注意到天开始凉了起来。快到把蓝色秋季外套换成蓝色冬季外套的时候了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He always knows when it's about to snow because his wife starts nagging about turning up the heat in the bedroom. Lunacy, Ove reaffirms every year. Why should the power company directors feather their nests because of a bit of seasonality? Turning up the heat five degrees costs thousands of kronor per year. He knows because he's calculated it himself. So every winter he drags down an old diesel generator from the attic that he swapped at a rummage sale for a gramophone. He's connected this to a fan heater he bought at a sale for thirty-nine kronor. Once the generator has charged up the fan heater, it runs for thirty minutes on the little battery Ove has hooked it up to, and his wife keeps it on her side of the bed. She can run it a couple of times before they go to bed, but only a couple -- no need to be lavish about it ("Diesel isn't free, you know"). And Ove's wife does what she always does: nods and agrees that Ove is probably right. Then she goes around all winter sneakily turning up the radiators. Every year the same bloody thing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他总是知道什么时候会下雪，因为一到时候，他的太太就会开始念叨要把卧室暖一暖。疯了，每年这时候欧维都一口咬定。电力公司老板休想因为一点季节更替的小事就坐享其成。暖个五度，一年就得多花几千克朗，这个欧维算得出来。所以每年冬天他都会从阁楼上取下那台他在跳蚤市场上用一台老式留声机换来的柴油发电机，然后接上以清仓价三十九克朗买来的暖风机。用发电机启动之后，暖风机能在欧维安装的小电池上跑上半个小时，这样欧维的太太就能在躺下睡觉前让靠自己这边的床暖和上几次。不过欧维还是叫她不要太浪费，柴油也不是白给的。太太就像往常一样，点头表示欧维说的有道理。然后整个冬天，她都会趁他不注意，偷偷把暖气片打开。每年都是这样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ove kicks the ground again. He's considering telling her about the cat. If you can even call that mangy, half-bald creature a cat. It was sitting there again when he came back from his inspection, practically right outside their front door. He pointed at it and shouted so loudly that his voice echoed between the houses. The cat just sat there, looking at Ove. Then it stood up elaborately, as if making a point of demonstrating that it wasn't leaving because of Ove, but rather because there were better things to do, and disappeared around the corner.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维又踹踹泥土。他考虑着要不要把猫咪的事告诉她。他巡逻回来的时候，它又出现在那里。欧维瞪着它，它瞪着欧维。欧维指着它大喝一声走开，声音之大，就像一枚疯狂的塑胶球在房子之间回荡。猫又瞪了一会儿欧维，不紧不慢地站起身，仿佛在表示它不是因为欧维的威吓走开的，而是因为有更好玩的事等着，然后就这样消失在储藏室的拐角处。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ove decides not to mention the cat to her. He assumes she'll only be disgruntled with him for driving it away. If she was in charge the whole house would be full of tramps, whether of the furred variety or not.</div>

She tells him to leave the top button undone if he's not wearing a tie; he protests that he's not some urchin who's renting out deck chairs, before defiantly buttoning it up. He's got his dented old wristwatch on, the one that his dad inherited from his father when he was nineteen, the one that was passed on to Ove after his sixteenth birthday, a few days after his father died.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ove's wife likes that suit. She always says he looks so handsome in it. Like any sensible person, Ove is obviously of the opinion that only posers wear their best suits on weekdays. But this morning he decided to make an exception. He even put on his black going-out shoes and polished them with a responsible amount of boot shine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维的太太喜欢这件蓝西装，总说他这么穿看上去很帅。而欧维自己，像每个明智的人一样，认为只有公子哥才每天穿西装。但早上他决定，今天可以是个例外。他甚至穿上了那双出客穿的黑色皮鞋，还很负责任地上了适量的鞋油。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He walked out of the house before anyone on the street had even woken up. Strolled up to the parking area. Opened his garage with a key. He had a remote control for the door, but had never understood the point of it. An honest person could just as well open the door manually. He unlocked the Saab, also with a key: the system had always worked perfectly well, there was no reason to change it. He sat in the driver's seat and twisted the tuning dial half forward and then half back before adjusting each of the mirrors, as he did every time he got into the Saab. As if someone routinely broke into the Saab and mischievously changed Ove's mirrors and radio channels.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="出门的时候，小区里还没有人起床。他走到停车场，用钥匙打开车库门。他其实有个遥控器，但从来不明白这有什么好处，本来每个老实人就都可以亲手打开车库门。他也用钥匙打开萨博的车门。这车多年来一直很好使，没有理由把车换掉。他坐进驾驶座，把电台的频道旋钮朝前拧半圈，再朝后拧半圈。调整所有的后视镜。每次坐上萨博都要这么来一圈，就像有什么破坏分子每天按时闯进来恶意调过后视镜和电台调频。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As he took his autumn jacket from the hook in the hall before he went out, he threw a thoughtful eye on his wife's collection of coats. He wondered how such a small human being could have so many winter coats. "You almost expect if you stepped through this lot you'd find yourself in Narnia," a friend of Ove's wife had once joked. Ove didn't have a clue what she was talking about, but he did agree there were a hell of a lot of coats.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="出门前，从大厅的挂钩上取秋季外套时，他最后回头若有所思地看了一眼太太的那堆外套，思考着为什么个子这么小的人会有这么多冬季大衣。“几乎可以期待一下穿过这堆衣服就能进入纳尼亚了。”欧维太太的某个女朋友曾经开玩笑说。欧维到现在还不知道她到底是什么意思，反正大衣多到吓死人就是了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As he drove across the parking area he passed that Pregnant Foreign Woman from next door. She was holding her three-year-old by the hand. The big blond Lanky One was walking beside her. All three of them caught sight of Ove and waved cheerfully. Ove didn't wave back. At first he was going to stop and give her a dressing-down about letting children run about in the parking area as if it were some municipal playground. But he decided he didn't have the time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他开车穿过停车场的时候，遇到了隔壁那个外国孕妇。她牵着三岁女孩的手，那个高个子金发盲流走在她身边。看见欧维后，他们三个人一起兴高采烈地冲他挥手。欧维没有回礼。他首先想到停车教育一下那个女人，这个小区里没有谁家的小孩会在停车场周围跑来跑去，这儿又不是公共游乐场。但他想了想，觉得自己没那个时间。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He drove along, passing row after row of houses identical to his own. When they'd first moved in here there were only six houses; now there were hundreds of them. There used to be a forest here but now there were only houses. Everything paid for with loans, of course. That was how you did it nowadays. Shopping on credit and driving electric cars and hiring tradesmen to change a lightbulb. Laying click-on floors and fitting electric fireplaces and carrying on. A society that apparently could not see the difference between the correct anchor bolt for a concrete wall and a smack in the face. Clearly this was how it was meant to be.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是他开到排屋外的大路上，经过一排又一排和自己的房子长得一模一样的房子。欧维和太太搬来的时候，这里只有六幢房子。现在房子数以百计。曾经，这里只有树林，但现在到处都是房子。肯定都是贷款买的。现在的人会的就是这个。信用卡消费，开电动车，换个电灯泡都得雇人。安装简易地板和电子壁炉，年复一年，日复一日。没人分得清普通混凝土膨胀螺栓和当头一棒之间的区别，这就是当今的社会。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It took him exactly fourteen minutes to drive to the florist's in the shopping center. Ove kept exactly to every speed limit, even on that 35 mph road where the recently arrived idiots in suits came tanking along at 55. Among their own houses they put up speed bumps and damnable numbers of signs about "Children Playing," but when driving past other people's houses it was apparently less important. Ove had repeated this to his wife every time they drove past over the last ten years.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他花了十四分钟开到购物中心的鲜花店。欧维牢牢卡着限速，哪怕是限速五十的区域，那些初来乍到、领带飘飘的傻逼总是开到九字打头。他们在自己的房子周围竖起“儿童嬉戏”的警示牌，铺上要命的限速带，但一旦开到别人的地盘立马不当一回事。最近十年，每次经过这里，欧维就要对太太这么说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And it's getting worse and worse," he liked to add, just in case by some miracle she hadn't heard him the first time.</div>

<div class="line_en">Today he'd barely gone a mile before a black Mercedes positioned itself a forearm's length behind his Saab. Ove signaled with his brake lights three times. The Mercedes flashed its high beams at him in an agitated manner. Ove snorted at his rearview mirror. As if it was his duty to fling himself out of the way as soon as these morons decided speed restrictions didn't apply to them. Honestly. Ove didn't move. The Mercedes gave him a burst of its high beams again. Ove slowed down. The Mercedes sounded its horn. Ove lowered his speed to 15 mph. When they reached the top of a hill the Mercedes overtook him with a roar. The driver, a man in his forties in a tie and with white cables trailing from his ears, held up his finger through the window at Ove. Ove responded to the gesture in the manner of all men of a certain age who've been properly raised: by slowly tapping the tip of his finger against the side of his head. The man in the Mercedes shouted until his saliva spattered against the inside of his windshield, then put his foot down and disappeared.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="今天他还没开出两公里远，后面就有一辆黑色的奔驰顶到了只剩一个胳膊肘的距离。欧维用刹车灯闪了他三次。奔驰愤怒地用亮瞎眼的远光灯回应。欧维冲着后视镜哼了一声，就好像一旦有人自作主张决定无视限速标志，他就有义务挡在路中央加以阻拦。欧维没有移动，奔驰又闪了一下远光灯。欧维减速，奔驰摁喇叭。欧维再减速，奔驰把喇叭摁得更响。欧维把速度减到二十，靠近坡顶的时候，奔驰轰隆一声超了过去。车里四十岁左右、扎着领带、耳朵里挂着白色塑料线的男人透过车窗冲欧维竖起中指。欧维用一个所有五十九岁有教养的男人都会做的动作回应：缓缓地用食指点点太阳穴。奔驰里的男人破口大骂，车窗内侧溅满了唾沫，然后一脚油门冲出了视野。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The man in the Mercedes gave a blast on his horn. Idiot, thought Ove. In the same moment the traffic started moving. The cars in front of Ove moved off. The car behind him, a Volkswagen, beeped at him. The driver waved impatiently at Ove. Ove glared back. He got back into the Saab and leisurely closed the door. "Amazing what a rush we're in," he scoffed into the rearview mirror and drove on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="奔驰男狂摁喇叭。“傻逼。”欧维心想。就在此刻，队伍挪动起来。欧维前面的车已经开动，后面的车——一辆大众——开始摁喇叭。车里的司机不耐烦地朝欧维挥手，欧维回头瞪了一眼，悠悠地坐回萨博里，关上车门。“这是着的什么急。”他大声对着后视镜说，然后上路。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The light turned green. The line didn't move. Ove sounded his horn. Nothing happened. Ove shook his head. Must be a woman driver. Or roadwork. Or an Audi. When thirty seconds had passed without anything happening, Ove put the car into neutral, opened the door, and stepped out of the Saab with the engine still running. Stood in the road and peered ahead with his hands on his hips, filled with a kind of Herculean irritation: the way Superman might have stood if he'd got stuck in a traffic jam.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="信号灯转绿，队伍却没有动。欧维摁喇叭，没有动静。欧维摇头。前面一定有个女司机，或者在修路，要不就是有辆奥迪。三十秒过去还是没有动静，欧维挂上空挡，开门走出还转着发动机的萨博。他双手叉腰站在路中央朝队伍前方张望，有点像钢铁侠遭遇堵车会怒气冲冲双手叉腰站到路中央的样子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Two minutes later Ove came to a red light. The Mercedes was at the back of the line. Ove flashed his lights at it. He saw the driver craning his neck around. The white earpieces dropped out and fell against the dashboard. Ove nodded with satisfaction.</div>

<div class="line_en">At the next red light he ended up behind the Mercedes again. Another line. Ove checked his watch and took a left turn down a smaller, quiet road. This entailed a longer route to the shopping center, but there were fewer traffic lights. Not that Ove was mean. But as anyone who knows anything knows, cars use less fuel if they keep moving rather than stopping all the time. And, as Ove's wife often says: "If there's one thing you could write in Ove's obituary, it's 'At least he was economical with gas.'"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="下一个红灯，他又停在了奔驰后面。又堵上了。欧维看看手表，向左转上了另一条路。其实，去购物中心，这条路更长，但是红灯少一些。并不是因为欧维小心眼，但懂事的人都知道，车开动的时候比转着发动机堵着省油。就像欧维太太常说的那样：“要是有什么值得写进欧维的讣告，那就是‘无论如何，此人还算省油’。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As Ove approached the shopping center from his little side road, he could just make out that there were only two parking spaces left.

<div class="line_en">Ove's wife usually starts sighing as soon as they even get close to a parking lot like this. Ove wants to park close to the entrance. "As if there's a competition about who can find the best parking spot," she always says as he completes circuit after circuit and swears at all the imbeciles getting in his way in their foreign cars. Sometimes they end up doing six or seven loops before they find a good spot, and if Ove in the end has to concede defeat and content himself with a slot twenty yards farther away, he's in a bad mood for the rest of the day. His wife has never understood it. Then again, she never was very good at grasping questions of principle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维的太太曾经一靠近这样一个停车场就开始叹气，欧维总是想停在商场入口处。“就像要参加一场比赛，看谁抢到最好的位置。”每当他一圈又一圈地转，冲着每辆占了地儿的外国车咒骂的时候，她都会这么说。经常得转上六七圈才能找到一个好位置，要是最后欧维不得不放弃而停在二十米开外，这一天他都没好气。他的太太从来就不理解，不过她也不是很清楚什么叫原则问题。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ove figured he would go around slowly a couple of times just to check the lay of the land, but then suddenly caught sight of the Mercedes thundering along the main road towards the shopping center. So this was where he'd been heading, that suit with the plastic cables in his ears. Ove didn't hesitate for a second. He put his foot down and barged his way out of the intersection into the road. The Mercedes slammed on its brakes, firmly pressing down on the horn and following close behind. The race was on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="本来今天欧维也想转上两圈，察看一下地形。但就在这时，他又看见那辆奔驰由南向北开过来。那个扎领带、耳朵里挂塑料线的男人，原来是要来这儿。欧维一秒钟都没有犹豫，一脚油门挤进了十字路口。奔驰急刹车，猛按一下喇叭跟了上来。决斗正式开始。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The signs at the parking lot entrance led the traffic to the right, but when they got there the Mercedes must also have seen the two empty slots, because he tried to slip past Ove on the left. Ove only just managed to maneuver himself in front of him to block his path. The two men started hunting each other across the tarmac.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="停车场入口处的指示牌指向右侧，但奔驰显然也看到了那两个空车位，试图从左侧超过欧维。然而欧维闪电般一拧方向盘堵住了去路。两个男人开始在柏油路上较起劲来。">查看中文翻译</div>

Ove's eyes followed it while he hurtled forward in the opposite direction, with the Mercedes on his tail. Of course, he could have taken one of the free slots, the one closest to the entrance, and then had the kindness of letting the Mercedes take the other. But what sort of victory would that have been?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从后视镜里，欧维看见一辆小丰田从大路上拐到他们身后，跟着指示牌沿停车场缓缓朝右拐了个大弯。欧维用余光跟着它，同时朝反方向猛冲，奔驰紧随其后。他当然可以抢下两个空位中更靠近商场入口的那个，然后大方地把另一个让给奔驰。可这又算哪门子胜利？">查看中文翻译</div>

The little Toyota approached from the far right. The Mercedes also caught sight of it and, too late, understood Ove's devilish plan. Its horn wailed furiously as it tried to push past the Saab, but it never stood a chance: Ove had already waved the Toyota into one of the free slots. Only once it was safely in did Ove nonchalantly swing into the other space.</div>

<div class="line_en">He moved on from the supermarket and stepped into the florist's. And there it didn't take long for a "rumble" to start up, as Ove's wife would have described it. Or a "discussion," as Ove always insisted on calling it. Ove put down a coupon on the counter on which it said: "2 plants for 50 kronor." Given that Ove only wanted one plant, he explained to the shop assistant, with all rhyme and reason on his side, he should be able to buy it for 25 kronor. Because that was half of 50. However, the assistant, a brain-dead phone-texting nineteen-year-old, would not go along with it. She maintained that a single flower cost 39 kronor and "2 for 50" only applied if one bought two. The manager had to be summoned. It took Ove fifteen minutes to make him see sense and agree that Ove was right.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他沿着食品店继续向前走，来到花店。在那儿理所当然会有一场“争吵”，欧维太太一定会用这个词。但欧维总会辩解说那其实只是“讨论”。欧维取出一张优惠券来，上面写着“两支五十”。既然只需要买一支，他对柜员一通摆事实讲道理，要只付二十五。因为五十的一半是二十五。那个手机贴闪片、脑子粘了口香糖的柜员当然不同意。她反复强调一支三十九，优惠券只有买两支的时候才能用。店长不得不登场。然后欧维花了三刻钟才让店长幡然醒悟，原来欧维是对的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Or, to be honest about it, the manager mumbled something that sounded a little like "bloody old sod" into his hand and hammered 25 kronor so hard into the cash register that anyone would have thought it was the machine's fault. It made no difference to Ove. He knew these retailers were always trying to screw you out of money, and no one screwed Ove and got away with it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其实，老实说店长还是在自己手掌心里嘟囔了一句，听起来像“老浑蛋”，然后在柜员机上狠狠地打上二十五克朗，就好像这都是柜员机的错。其实欧维心里多多少少也是这么想的。他知道这帮商贩葫芦里卖的什么药，砍上一刀是一刀，但在欧维这儿可没门。他可是说一不二的人。">查看中文翻译</div>
