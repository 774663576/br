<div class="line_en">This frozen state can last for hours, and then, like dawn breaking, she'll wake to my presence. At these times I've learned to wait and see which way the cat jumps, because she's so unpredictable. Sometimes she's pensive, just wanting to be held, sometimes she's as sullen and spiteful as a child. When she wants sex, she reaches for me. After four days and nights at sea, this has become a raw, feral business. We need the water that we have for drinking, washing is impossible, and our bodies are rank. Not that either of us cares. Villanelle knows what she wants and goes straight for it, and with the last of my inhibitions dispelled by the darkness and the desperate uncertainty of our situation, I'm soon giving as good as I get. Villanelle likes this. She's much stronger than me, and could easily throw me off when I pin her down and roll on top of her, but she lets it happen, and lies there as I stroke her breast, and my tongue and my teeth probe for the scar tissue on her lip. And then she grabs my hand and pulls it downwards, cramming my fingers inside her, and grinds against the heel of my palm until she's gasping, and sometimes laughing, and I can feel the muscles of her thighs twitching and shuddering.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She withdraws. She locks herself into the secret citadel of her mind. I'm sitting there next to her, her leg warm against mine, our breath mingling, but she could be a thousand miles away, so arctic is her solitude. Sometimes it happens when we lie down to sleep and she burrows into me for warmth. Part of her is just not there. I long to tell her that she's not alone, but the truth is that she's utterly alone.</div>

I saved your life, and I risked my own, which to be very honest with you was a fucking stupid thing to do.

<div class="line_en">She's such a jagged cluster of contradictions. I had no idea that anyone could be so ferociously self-sufficient, and at the same time so emotionally unstable. One moment she's flirtatious and tender, covering my face with kisses, the next she's spitting the most wounding things at me that she can think of. I know her cruelty is just a front, a way of protecting her fragile sense of self, but it pierces me like a knife every time. Because right now, if I don't have her I don't have anything. And she knows it.</div>

<div class="line_en">We talk. In fits and starts to begin with, but soon for hours on end. Talking distracts me from the painful stomach contractions I've started experiencing. When they started, like a snake coiling tighter and tighter in my guts, I was afraid I had gastroenteritis or a knotted intestine. I told Villanelle and she laughed, prodded my stomach with a hard finger, and told me I was hungry. "I had this often when I was a child. It will be bad for a day or two then it will go."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Why is she doing it? The staging of my death and our escape from London was so bold, so meticulously executed. Why is Villanelle going to so much trouble on my behalf? Does she really care for me, or am I just a fixation, an itch that she has to scratch? And what about me? What do I feel, beyond the fact that I want her, desperately, and live for the moments when we reach for each other in the darkness?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Perhaps I shouldn't be surprised at Villanelle's behavior, because although it's crazy to get upset about Rinse-Aid, it makes me realize just how utterly solitary her existence has been. She's never used a dishwasher because she's never needed one: she's always lived and eaten alone. In choosing to save my life, and in doing so risking her own, she went against her own nature.</div>

<div class="line_en">Her tendency to fictionalize her life makes it hard to establish a definitive story, but I already know the basic facts, and gradually I fit the pieces together. She was born Oxana Borisovna Vorontsova in Perm, a second-tier industrial city near the Urals. Her mother died of cancer when she was young, her father was a soldier, often absent. Diagnosed with an antisocial personality disorder, Oxana endured a lonely and friendless childhood. She excelled at her studies but was often in trouble for violent and disruptive behavior. While at secondary school she formed a close attachment to her French teacher, a woman named Anna Leonova. One night, after school, Anna was sexually assaulted at a bus stop. A local youth was suspected of carrying out the attack, and shortly afterward he was discovered incoherent and suffering from massive blood loss. "I castrated him," Villanelle tells me with a touch of smugness. "I pretended I was going to give him a blow job, then cut off his balls with a knife. No one guessed it was me."</div>

</div>
</div>
<div class="line_en">In fact, the local police had a pretty good idea who was responsible. They already had a juvenile file on Oxana Vorontsova, but abandoned the investigation for lack of evidence. They would be more tenacious when Oxana, by now at university, was arrested for murder. The victims were three local gangsters who, she claimed, had killed her father. This accords with what I was told by Vadim Tikhomirov of the FSB, although Villanelle's version of events differs substantially from the official report. According to her, her father was working undercover for the security services, and had infiltrated the gang. According to the police, he was a low-grade enforcer for the gang and had been caught stealing from his bosses.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">While she awaited trial, Oxana's release from prison was engineered by a man named Konstantin. She never knew his full name, but it's probable that this was Konstantin Orlov, a former intelligence officer of considerable distinction and reputation. Orlov had for some years run the FSB's Directorate S, a secretive bureau whose operational remit included the elimination of foreign enemies of the Russian state. By the time that Oxana encountered Orlov, it appears that he was performing a similar service for an organization called the Twelve. "He knew everything about me, right back to my childhood," Villanelle remembers with pride. "He told me that I had been born to change history."</div>

</div>
<div class="line_en">What this meant in practical terms was that she became a paid assassin for the Twelve. Orlov supervised her training, and later became her handler, installing her in the apartment in Paris, and at intervals dispatching her on kill missions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Villanelle loved her new life. The airy apartment overlooking the Bois de Boulogne, the money, the beautiful clothes. She even made a friend, a wealthy young woman named Anne-Laure, with whom she shared lunches at fashionable restaurants, shopping trips and occasional ménages à trois. I think that what she loved even more than this gilded existence, though, was the secret thrill of knowing that she wasn't the person the world thought she was. When she looked in the mirror, she saw not a chic young socialite, but a dark angel, a bringer of death. She was addicted as much to the secrecy as to the killing itself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She still is. She doesn't tell me her plans for when we get to Russia because withholding this knowledge gives her power over me. Whether I can persuade her to relax her grip, I don't know. I hope so, because if we can't trust each other we're not going to make it.</div>

I lie there unmoving, her arm heavy on mine, her breath whistling across my ear. Careful not to wake her, I maneuver myself into a position where I can see my watch. It's gone 6 a. m., Baltic time. Outside the day is dawning, cold and dangerous.</div>

<div class="line_en">The last night in the container is the worst. The wind screams across our bow, pounding against the container stacks so that they creak and groan. In the darkness, my hunger pangs and the vessel's pitch and roll join forces to nauseating effect. I draw my knees up against my chest and lie open-eyed as acid rises into my throat. Then I'm on my hands and knees, retching uncontrollably, but there's nothing in my stomach to come up. The wind continues its assault for hours, until my body is wrung out and my throat raw from dry heaving.</div>

<div class="line_en">"But I didn't know how you were feeling." She gets to her feet and stumbles across the clothing bales to the safety hatch. A minute later the interior of the container is illuminated with a thin morning light. Pulling down her leggings and pants, Villanelle squats over the bucket. In her thick sweater she looks shapeless and bedraggled, her hair standing out from her head in spikes. I follow her to the bucket, pee in my turn, then carry it over to the hatch and pour it out. The urine freezes immediately, thickening the cascade of yellowish ice streaking the container's exterior.</div>

<div class="line_en">Bracing myself against the sub-zero blast of the wind, I search the horizon. Slicing between sea and sky is a faint, gray knife blade. I'm not sure if it's a trick of the light, so I find my glasses in my bike-jacket pocket and look again. It's land. Russia. I stare out of the hatch, trying to focus my thoughts, and then Villanelle is beside me, her cold cheek pressed to mine.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes."</div>

<div class="line_en">I turn to her, and we hold each other, my fingers in her greasy hair, hers in mine. "It's been a good honeymoon, hasn't it?" she says.</div>

<div class="line_en">"OK." I watch as the silhouette of St. Petersburg slowly hardens. "Villanelle?"</div>

<div class="line_en">She slips a hand under my sweater and over my heart. "It's not a problem. Being scared when you're in danger is normal."</div>
