<div class="line_en">Jack found the scrapbook on the first of November, while his wife and son were hiking up the rutted old road that ran from behind the roque court to a deserted sawmill two miles further up. The fine weather still held, and all three of them had acquired improbable autumn suntans.</div>

<div class="line_en">He flickered the light around, whistling tunelessly between his teeth. There was a scale-model Andes range down here: dozens of boxes and crates stuffed with papers, most of them white and shapeless with age and damp. Others had broken open and spilled yellowed sheaves of paper onto the stone floor. There were bales of newspaper tied up with hayrope. Some boxes contained what looked like ledgers, and others contained invoices bound with rubber bands. Jack pulled one out and put the flashlight beam on it.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ullman's explanations of the Overlook's checkered career still didn't ring quite true to him. It seemed that the Overlooks spectacular location alone should have guaranteed its continuing success. There had always been an American jetset, even before jets were invented, and it seemed to Jack that the Overlook should have been one of the bases they touched in their migrations. It even sounded right. The Waldorf in May, the Bar Harbor House in June and July, the Overlook in August and early September, before moving on to Bermuda, Havana, Rio, wherever. He found a pile of old desk registers and they bore him out.</div>

<div class="line_en">He supposed he was fascinated by that commonplace sense of history that anyone can feel glancing through the fresh news of ten or twenty years ago.

When it had been between suckers grabbing for the brass ring.</div>

<div class="line_en">He walked slowly between the mountains of paper, his mind alive and ticking over possibilities in a speedy way that was exhilarating. He hadn't felt this way in years. It suddenly seemed that the book he had semi-jokingly promised himself might really happen. It might even be right here, buried in these untidy heaps of paper. It could be a work of fiction, or history, or both -- a long book exploding out of this central place in a hundred directions.</div>

<div class="line_en">A pile of five boxes stood on his left like some tottering Pisa. The one on top was stuffed with more invoices and ledgers.

<div class="line_en">Curious, he went over and took it down. The top cover was thick with dust. He held it on a plane at lip level, blew the dust off in a cloud, and opened it. As he did so a card fluttered out and he grabbed it in mid-air before it could fall to the stone floor. It was rich and creamy, dominated by a raised engraving of the Overlook with every window alight. The lawn and playground were decorated with glowing Japanese lanterns. It looked almost as though you could step right into it, an Overlook Hotel that had existed thirty years ago.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="出于好奇，杰克走过去将剪报簿取了下来，簿子封面蒙了一层厚厚的灰尘。他把簿子举到嘴唇的高度，猛吹一口，灰尘像云团一样飘散而去。杰克打开剪报簿，一张请帖飞了出来，他在半空中抓住了它。请帖光滑润泽，灯火通明的远望饭店凸版画占据了它的大部分版面。饭店所有的窗户都透射着光亮，草坪和游戏场装饰着熠熠生辉的日本灯笼。画面立体感很强，仿佛人们可以直接步入其中似的。这是三十年前的远望饭店。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Derwent, who makes no secret of having sunk more than one million dollars into his newest venture -- and some say the figure is closer to three million -- says that "The new Overlook will be one of the world's showplaces, the kind of hotel you will remember overnigbting in thirty years later." When Derwent, who is rumored to have substantial Las Vegas holdings, was asked if his purchase and refurbishing of the Overlook signaled the opening gun in a battle to legalize casino-style gambling in Colorado, the aircraft, movie, munitions, and shipping magnate denied it… with a smile. "The Overlook would be cheapened by gambling," he said, "and don't think I'm knocking Vegas! They've got too many of my markers out there for me to do that! I have no interest in lobbying for legalized gambling in Colorado. It would be spitting into the wind."

Born poor in St. Paul, never finished high school, joined the Navy instead. Rose rapidly, then left in a bitter wrangle over the patent on a new type of propeller that he had designed. In the tug of war between the Navy and an unknown young man named Horace Derwent, Uncle Sam came off the predictable winner. But Uncle Sam had never gotten another patent, and there had been a lot of them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰克匆匆地浏览了一遍文章内容。他熟知过去一年里《新闻周刊》上差不多每一篇关于德文特的报道。生于圣保罗，中学肄业，曾在海军服役。他在海军颇受赏识，后来因为他设计的一种新型推进装置的专利权纠纷离开了海军。在海军与无名小卒贺拉斯·德文特之间的较量中，山姆大叔成为可以预见的赢家，但山姆大叔从此再也没有获得本可以得到的任何一项专利。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Smiling bemusedly, Jack turned the page. Now he was looking at a full-page ad from the New York Sunday Times travel section. On the page after that a story on Derwent himself, a balding man with eyes that pierced you even from an old newsprint photo. He was wearing rimless spectacles and a forties-style pencil-line mustache that did nothing at all to make him look like Errol Flynn. His face was that of an accountant. It was the eyes that made him look like someone or something else.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the late twenties and early thirties, Derwent turned to aviation. He bought out a bankrupt cropdusting company, turned it into an airmail service, and prospered. More patents followed: a new monoplane wing design, a bomb carriage used on the Flying Fortresses that had rained fire on Hamburg and Dresden and Berlin, a machine gun that was cooled by alcohol, a prototype of the ejection seat later used in United States jets.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="20年代末、30年代初，德文特转而涉足航空界。他买下一家破产的农药飞喷公司，继而把它改造成了一家航空邮递公司，从此便发了财。后来他又获得多项专利：一种全新的单翼飞机机翼设计，一种用在轰炸汉堡、德累斯顿和柏林的“飞行堡垒”上的炸弹舱托架，一种酒精散热机关枪，以及后来用在美国喷气机上的一种弹射座椅的样椅。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And along the line, the accountant who lived in the same skin as the inventor kept piling up the investments. A piddling string of munition factories in New York and New Jersey. Five textile mills in New England. Chemical factories in the bankrupt and groaning South. At the end of the Depression his wealth had been nothing but a handful of controlling interests, bought at abysmally low prices, salable only at lower prices still. At one point Derwent boasted that he could liquidate completely and realize the price of a three year-old Chevrolet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="与此同时，这位会计师兼发明家的生意也日益红火起来。他在纽约和新泽西州两地拥有多家军火工厂，在新英格兰有五家纺织厂，在苟延残喘的南方有几家化工厂。不过，大萧条结束时，他的财产还仅限于以极其低廉的价格收购而且只能以更低价格才能出手的不多的几家控股公司。有一次，德文特吹嘘说他所有的资产变卖后够得上一辆已用了3年的旧雪弗莱轿车的价钱。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Probably Derwent's most famous investment was the purchase of the foundering Top Mark Studios, which had not had a bit since their child star, Little Margery Morris, had died of a heroin overdose in 1934. She was fourteen. Little Margery, who had specialized in sweet seven-year-olds who saved marriages and the lives of dogs unjustly accused of killing chickens, had been given the biggest Hollywood funeral in history by Top Mark -- the official story was that Little Margery had contracted a "wasting disease" while entertaining at a New York orphanage -- and some cynics suggested the studio had laid out all that long green because it knew it was burying itself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="德文特最引人注目的一宗买卖也许当属收购濒临倒闭的托普马克制片公司，这家制片厂自从它的童星小玛格莉·莫丽丝1934年死于过量服用海洛因后便一蹶不振，从未拍出过引起轰动的影片。小玛格莉死时刚满14岁，她善于扮演七岁的小甜妞——专门拯救婚姻和被冤枉为杀害小鸡的凶手的小狗们的生命。托普马克制片厂为她举行了好莱坞历史上最隆重的葬礼——官方报道说她在纽约一家孤儿院演出时染上了某种“痨病”——而某些刻薄的好事者则称制片厂之所以如此慷慨，是因为它知道自己的末日即将来临。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There had been rumors, Jack recalled, that some of the means employed by Derwent to keep his head above water were less than savory. Involvement with bootlegging. Prostitution in the Midwest. Smuggling in the coastal areas of the South where his fertilizer factories were. Finally an association with the nascent western gambling interests.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰克记得曾有传言说德文特为使自己免遭灭顶之灾曾使用了不那么体面的手段。他涉嫌参与酿造私酒；在中西部从事淫业；在其化工厂所在的南部沿海地带从事走私活动；另外，他还与方兴未艾的西部赌博业不无牵连。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The feature films were huge successes. During one of them an unnamed costume designer had juryrigged a strapless bra for the heroine to appear in during the Grand Ball scene, where she revealed everything except possibly the birthmark just below the cleft of her buttocks. Derwent received credit for this invention as well, and his reputation -- or notoriety -- grew.</div>
