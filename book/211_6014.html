<div class="line_en">The basket was heavy and the bundle was large, but she lugged them along like a person who did not find her especial burden in material things. Occasionally she stopped to rest in a mechanical way by some gate or post; and then, giving the baggage another hitch upon her full round arm, went steadily on again.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a Sunday morning in late October, about four months after Tess Durbeyfield's arrival at Trantridge, and some few weeks subsequent to the night ride in The Chase. The time was not long past daybreak, and the yellow luminosity upon the horizon behind her back lighted the ridge towards which her face was set -- the barrier of the vale wherein she had of late been a stranger -- which she would have to climb over to reach her birthplace. The ascent was gradual on this side, and the soil and scenery differed much from those within Blakemore Vale. Even the character and accent of the two peoples had shades of difference, despite the amalgamating effects of a roundabout railway; so that, though less than twenty miles from the place of her sojourn at Trantridge, her native village had seemed a far-away spot. The field-folk shut in there traded northward and westward, travelled, courted, and married northward and westward, thought northward and westward; those on this side mainly directed their energies and attention to the east and south.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是十月末一个礼拜天的早晨，大约在苔丝·德北菲尔德来到特兰里奇四个月以后，离他们骑马在猎苑走夜路有几个礼拜。天刚亮不久，她背后的地平线上出现的黄色光辉，照亮了她面前的那道山梁——这道山梁把山谷隔开，最近以来，她一直是山谷里的一个外来人——她只要翻过这道山梁，就可以回到她出生的地方了。在山梁的这一边，上坡的路是舒缓的，土壤和景物也同布莱克莫尔谷的土壤和景物大不相同。尽管那条蜿蜒而过的铁路起到了一些同化的作用，但是两边的人甚至在性格和口音方面也有细微的差别；因此，虽然她的故乡离她在特兰里奇的短暂居处还不到二十英里，但是已经似乎变成了一个很遥远的地方。封闭在那边的乡民到北边和西边去做买卖、旅行、求婚，同北边和西边的人结婚，一心想着西边和北边；而这边的人则把他们的精力和心思都放在东边和南边。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The incline was the same down which d'Urberville had driven with her so wildly on that day in June. Tess went up the remainder of its length without stopping, and on reaching the edge of the escarpment gazed over the familiar green world beyond, now half-veiled in mist. It was always beautiful from here; it was terribly beautiful to Tess to day, for since her eyes last fell upon it she had learnt that the serpent hisses where the sweet birds sing, and her views of life had been totally changed for her by the lesson. Verily another girl than the simple one she had been at home was she who, bowed by thought, stood still here, and turned to look behind her. She could not bear to look forward into the Vale.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这道斜坡就是在六月里那一天德贝维尔接她时疯狂驾车的同一道坡。苔丝没有休息，一口气走完了这道坡上还没有走完的路，到了山崖的边上，她向前面那个她所熟悉的绿色世界望去，只见它在雾霭中半隐半现。从这儿望去，它总是美丽的；今天在苔丝看来它极其美丽，因为自从上一次看见它以来，她已经懂得，在可爱的鸟儿歌唱的地方，也会有毒蛇咝叫，因为这次教训，她的人生观已经被完全改变了。以前还在家里的时候，她是一个天真的孩子，而与此相比她现在变成了另一个姑娘，她满腹心事地垂着头，静静地站在那儿，然后又转过身去看看身后。望着前面的山谷，她心里忍受不了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">'Why did you slip away by stealth like this?' said d'Urberville, with upbraiding breathlessness; 'on a Sunday morning, too, when people were all in bed! I only discovered it by accident, and I have been driving like the deuce to overtake you. Just look at the mare. Why go off like this? You know that nobody wished to hinder your going. And how unnecessary it has been for you to toll along on foot, and encumber yourself with this heavy load! I have followed like a madman, simply to drive you the rest of the distance, if you won't come back.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你为什么要这样偷偷地溜走呢？”德贝维尔上气不接下气地责备她说：“又是在礼拜天的早晨，大家都还在睡觉呀！我是碰巧发现你走了的，所以像鬼似地驾着车拼命地追，才赶上了你。你看看这匹母马就知道啦。为什么要像这样离开呢？你也知道，没有谁会阻拦你的。你这是何苦，要费力地步行走路，自己还带着这样沉重的行李！我像疯子一样地追了来，只是想赶车送你走完剩下的一段路，假使你不想回去的话。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">D'Urberville mechanically lit a cigar, and the journey was continued with broken unemotional conversation on the commonplace objects by the wayside. He had quite forgotten his struggle to kiss her when, in the early summer, they had driven in the opposite direction along the same road. But she had not, and she sat now, like a puppet, replying to his remarks in monosyllables. After some miles they came in view of the clump of trees beyond which the village of Marlott stood. It was only then that her still face showed the least emotion, a tear or two beginning to trickle down.</div>

<div class="line_en">Against the peaceful landscape, the pale, decaying tints of the copses, the blue air of the horizon, and the lichened stile-boards, these staring vermilion words shone forth. They seemed to shout themselves out and make the atmosphere ring. Some people might have cried 'Alas, poor Theology!' at the hideous defacement -- the last grotesque phase of a creed which had served mankind well in its time. But the words entered Tess with accusatory horror. It was as if this man had known her recent history; yet he was a total stranger.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="映衬着宁静的风景、矮树林灰白的枯黄色调、天边的蔚蓝色空气和长满苔藓的栅栏木板，那些鲜红的大字闪闪发光。每一个字都似乎在大声喊叫，连空气都被震得发响。也许有人会对这些讨厌的涂抹说“唉，可怜的神学！”——这种宗教当年也曾为人类服务过，现在是它最后的古怪一幕了。但是苔丝读到这些字，却感到有一种遭到指控的恐惧。就好像那个人已经知道了她最近的历史；但是他对苔丝的确是一无所知。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A plume of smoke soared up suddenly from her father's chimney, the sight of which made her heart ache. The aspect of the interior, when she reached it, made her heart ache more. Her mother, who had just come down stairs, turned to greet her from the fireplace, where she was kindling barked-oak twigs under the breakfast kettle.

<div class="line_en">Get Alec d'Urberville in the mind to marry her! He marry her! On matrimony he had never once said a word. And what if he had? How a convulsive snatching at social salvation might have impelled her to answer him she could not say. But her poor foolish mother little knew her present feeling towards this man. Perhaps it was unusual in the circumstances, unlucky, unaccountable; but there it was; and this, as she had said, was what made her detest herself. She had never wholly cared for him, she did not at all care for him now. She had dreaded him, winced before him, succumbed to adroit advantages he took of her helplessness; then, temporarily blinded by his ardent manners, had been stirred to confused surrender awhile: had suddenly despised and disliked him, and had run away. That was all. Hate him she did not quite; but he was dust and ashes to her, and even for her name's sake she scarcely wished to marry him.</div>
