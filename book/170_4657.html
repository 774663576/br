<div class="line_en">The onion knight had not forgotten Wyman Manderly's last words to him. Take this creature to the Wolf's Den and cut off head and hands, the fat lord had commanded. I shall not be able to eat a bite until I see this smuggler's head upon a spike, with an onion shoved between his lying teeth. Every night Davos went to sleep with those words in his head, and every morn he woke to them. And should he forget, Garth was always pleased to remind him. Dead man was his name for Davos. When he came by in the morning, it was always, "Here, porridge for the dead man." At night it was, "Blow out the candle, dead man."</div>

<div class="line_en">He woke to the sound of voices and crept to the door of his cell, but the wood was too thick and he could not make out the words. Dawn had come, but not the porridge Garth brought him every morn to break his fast. That made him anxious.

Garth may be sitting with a whetstone even now, to put an edge on Lady Lu.</div>

<div class="line_en">Once Garth brought his ladies by to introduce them to the dead man. "The Whore don't look like much," he said, fondling a rod of cold black iron, "but when I heat her up red-hot and let her touch your cock, you'll cry for mother. And this here's my Lady Lu. It's her who'll take your head and hands, when Lord Wyman sends down word." Davos had never seen a bigger axe than Lady Lu, nor one with a sharper edge. Garth spent his days honing her, the other keepers said. I will not plead for mercy, Davos resolved. He would go to his death a knight, asking only that they take his head before his hands. Even Garth would not be so cruel as to deny him that, he hoped.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一次加尔斯带着他的夫人们去向死人展示。“婊子貌不惊人，”他一边说一边爱抚着一条冰冷的黑铁，“但是当我把她弄到红热再让他摸摸你的老二，你准会哭着找妈妈。这是我的卢夫人。只要威曼伯爵一声令下，她就会砍掉你的头和手。”戴佛斯从没见过比卢夫人还大还锋利的斧子。加尔斯整天都在打磨她，另一个守卫说。我绝不会乞求怜悯，戴佛斯下定决心。他将会像个骑士一样死去，只求他们在砍掉他的手之前能先砍掉他的头。即使是加尔斯也不会残忍到拒绝这点要求吧，他希望。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The sounds coming through the door were faint and muffled. Davos rose and paced his cell. As cells went, it was large and queerly comfortable. He suspected it might once have been some lordling's bedchamber. It was thrice the size of his captain's cabin on Black Bessa, and even larger than the cabin Salladhor Saan enjoyed on his Valyrian. Though its only window had been bricked in years before, one wall still boasted a hearth big enough to hold a kettle, and there was an actual privy built into a corner nook. The floor was made of warped planks full of splinters, and his sleeping pallet smelled of mildew, but those discomforts were mild compared to what Davos had expected.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="穿过大门传来的声音微弱而又低沉。戴佛斯站起来，在囚室里踱来踱去。作为一间囚室，这里相当宽敞并且有种奇妙的舒适感。他怀疑这里可能曾是某位贵族的卧室。它的大小是他在黑贝塞号上那间船长舱的整整三倍，甚至比萨拉多？桑恩在他的瓦雷利亚号上享有的小舱还大。然而，唯一的窗户在多年前就已经被砖封死，一面墙上仍然有一个大的足够容纳一只茶壶的灶台，在墙角的隐蔽处修建了一个还能用的厕所。地板是用满是裂纹的弯曲厚木板铺就，而他睡觉的小床闻起来尽是霉味，但这些不舒适之处比戴佛斯预计的还是温和多了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The food had come as a surprise as well. In place of gruel and stale bread and rotten meat, the usual dungeon fare, his keepers brought him fresh-caught fish, bread still warm from the oven, spiced mutton, turnips, carrots, even crabs. Garth was none too pleased by that. "The dead should not eat better than the living," he complained, more than once. Davos had furs to keep him warm by night, wood to feed his fire, clean clothing, a greasy tallow candle. When he asked for paper, quill, and ink, Therry brought them the next day. When he asked for a book, so he might keep at his reading, Therry turned up with The Seven-Pointed Star.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="送来的食物也令他惊讶。不再是通常作为牢饭的稀粥、剩面包和烂肉，看守给他拿来了新鲜捕获的鱼，新鲜出炉的热面包，无香羊肉，芜菁，胡萝卜，甚至还有些螃蟹。加尔斯对此并不太高兴，“死人不该比活人吃的还好。”他不只一次抱怨到。戴佛斯有了能在夜间御寒的毛皮被子，能生火的木柴，干净的衣服，和一支动物油脂蜡烛。当他要求纸、鹅毛笔和墨水，Therry第二天就拿给了他。当他要求一本书，好让他坚持阅读，Therry就带回了一本七星圣典。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For all its comforts, though, his cell remained a cell. Its walls were solid stone, so thick that he could hear nothing of the outside world. The door was oak and iron, and his keepers kept it barred. Four sets of heavy iron fetters dangled from the ceiling, waiting for the day Lord Manderly decided to chain him up and give him over to the Whore. Today may be that day. The next time Garth opens my door, it may not be to bring me porridge.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管这一切让他觉得舒适，但牢房仍然是牢房。墙壁由坚固的石头砌成，厚的足以隔绝外界的任何声音。门是用橡木和铁制成，而守卫一直把它闩起来。四套沉重的铁镣铐从天花板上垂下，等着有一天曼德拉伯爵决定将他锁起来，让“婊子”送他上路。也许就是今天。下一次加尔斯打开门，也许就不是给我来送饭。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He knew there were true dungeons down in the castle cellars -- oubliettes and torture chambers and dank pits where huge black rats scrab-bled in the darkness. His gaolers claimed all of them were unoccupied at present. "Only us here, Onion," Ser Bartimus had told him. He was the chief gaoler, a cadaverous one-legged knight, with a scarred face and a blind eye. When Ser Bartimus was in his cups (and Ser Bartimus was in his cups most every day), he liked to boast of how he had saved Lord Wyman's life at the Battle of the Trident. The Wolf's Den was his reward.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他知道城堡地下确实有地牢——密牢、刑讯室和黑暗中大黑老鼠跑来跑去的阴湿洼地。在看守的要求之下，它们此刻全部空了出来。“这儿只有咱们，洋葱。”Bartimus爵士对他说过。他是牢头，一个形容枯槁的独腿骑士，脸上有伤疤还瞎了一只眼。当Bartimus爵士端着酒杯的时候（而他几乎每天都端着酒杯），总是喜欢吹嘘自己当年是如何在三叉戟河战役中救了威曼伯爵的性命。狼穴就是对他的奖赏。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His belly was rumbling, a sure sign that the morning was creeping past, and still no sign of food. The worst part is not the dying, it's not knowing when or how. He had seen the inside of a few gaols and dungeons in his smuggling days, but those he'd shared with other prisoners, so there was always someone to talk with, to share your fears and hopes. Not here. Aside from his keepers, Davos Seaworth had the Wolf's Den to himself.</div>

<div class="line_en">The rest of "us" consisted of a cook Davos never saw, six guardsmen in the ground-floor barracks, a pair of washerwomen, and the two turnkeys who looked after the prisoner. Therry was the young one, the son of one of the washerwomen, a boy of ten-and-four.

<div class="line_en">Neither man would speak about Lord Manderly or King Stannis or the Freys, but they would talk of other things. Therry wanted to go off to war when he was old enough, to fight in battles and become a knight. He liked to complain about his mother too. She was bedding two of the guardsmen, he confided. The men were on different watches and neither knew about the other, but one day one man or t'other would puzzle it out, and then there would be blood. Some nights the boy would even bring a skin of wine to the cell and ask Davos about the smuggler's life as they drank.</div>

<div class="line_en">His years as a smuggler had given Davos Seaworth a sense of when a man was wrong, and Garth was wrong. The onion knight took care to hold his tongue in Garth's presence. With Therry and Ser Bartimus he was less reticent. He thanked them for his food, encouraged them to talk about their hopes and histories, answered their questions politely, and never pressed too hard with queries of his own. When he made requests, they were small ones: a basin of water and a bit of soap, a book to read, more candles. Most such favors were granted, and Davos was duly grateful.</div>

<div class="line_en">After their fall, the castle had passed through many other hands. House Flint held it for a century, House Locke for almost two. Slates, Longs, Holts, and Ashwoods had held sway here, charged by Winterfell to keep the river safe. Reavers from the Three Sisters took the castle once, making it their toehold in the north. During the wars between Winterfell and the Vale, it was besieged by Osgood Arryn, the Old Falcon, and burned by his son, the one remembered as the Talon. When old King Edrick Stark had grown too feeble to defend his realm, the Wolf's Den was captured by slavers from the Stepstones. They would brand their captives with hot irons and break them to the whip before shipping them off across the sea, and these same black stone walls bore witness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们衰败之后，城堡由其他很多人经手过。菲林特家族占据了一个世纪，洛克家族占据了快两个世纪。Slates， Longs， Holts， and Ashwoods曾在此当道，效忠于临冬城以确保河道平安。三姐妹岛的Reavers曾经夺走城堡，把这里当做他们在北境的据点。在临冬城与谷地的战争期间，这里被“老猎鹰”奥斯古？艾林所包围，还被他以“魔爪”著称的儿子所焚毁。当老国王艾德瑞克？史塔克太过软弱无力保卫国家的时候，狼穴一度为石阶列岛的奴隶贩子们所占有。他们会用烧红的烙铁为俘虏打上印记，然后用鞭子抽打他们，把他们漂洋过海倒卖出去，而这些同样由黑石墙见证。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ser Bartimus had no interest in the world outside, or indeed anything that had happened since he lost his leg to a riderless horse and a maester's saw. He had come to love the Wolf's Den, however, and liked nothing more than to talk about its long and bloody history. The Den was much older than White Harbor, the knight told Davos. It had been raised by King Jon Stark to defend the mouth of the White Knife against raiders from the sea. Many a younger son of the King in the North had made his seat there, many a brother, many an uncle, many a cousin. Some passed the castle to their own sons and grandsons, and offshoot branches of House Stark had arisen; the Greystarks had lasted the longest, holding the Wolf's Den for five centuries, until they presumed to join the Dreadfort in rebellion against the Starks of Winterfell.</div>

<div class="line_en">Davos could not argue with the truth of that. From what he had seen at Eastwatch-by-the-Sea, he did not care to know winter either. "What gods do you keep?" he asked the one-legged knight.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Then a long cruel winter fell," said Ser Bartimus. "The White Knife froze hard, and even the firth was icing up. The winds came howling from the north and drove them slavers inside to huddle round their fires, and whilst they warmed themselves the new king come down on them. Brandon Stark this was, Edrick Snowbeard's great-grandson, him that men called Ice Eyes. He took the Wolf's Den back, stripped the slavers naked, and gave them to the slaves he'd found chained up in the dungeons. It's said they hung their entrails in the branches of the heart tree, as an offering to the gods. The old gods, not these new ones from the south. Your Seven don't know winter, and winter don't know them."</div>

I was a better smuggler than a knight, he had written to his wife, a better knight than a King's Hand, a better King's Hand than a husband. I am so sorry. Marya, I have loved you. Please forgive the wrongs I did you. Should Stannis lose his war, our lands will be lost as well. Take the boys across the narrow sea to Braavos and teach them to think kindly of me, if you would. Should Stannis gain the Iron Throne, House Seaworth will survive and Devan will remain at court. He will help you place the other boys with noble lords, where they can serve as pages and squires and win their knighthoods.

<div class="line_en">He had written to each of his three surviving sons as well, to help them remember the father who had bought them names with his fingertips. His notes to Steffon and young Stannis were short and stiff and awkward; if truth be told, he did not know them half as well as he had his older boys, the ones who'd burned or drowned upon the Blackwater. To Devan he wrote more, telling him how proud he was to see his own son as a king's squire and reminding him that as the eldest it was his duty to protect his lady mother and his younger brothers. Tell His Grace I did my best, he ended. I am sorry that I failed him. I lost my luck when I lost my finger-bones, the day the river burned below King's Landing.</div>

<div class="line_en">Glover led him along a darkened hall and down a flight of worn steps. They crossed the castle's godswood, where the heart tree had grown so huge and tangled that it had choked out all the oaks and elms and birch and sent its thick, pale limbs crashing through the walls and windows that looked down on it. Its roots were as thick around as a man's waist, its trunk so wide that the face carved into it looked fat and angry. Beyond the weir-wood, Glover opened a rusted iron gate and paused to light a torch. When it was blazing red and hot, he took Davos down more steps into a barrel-vaulted cellar where the weeping walls were crusted white with salt, and seawater sloshed beneath their feet with every step. They passed through several cellars, and rows of small, damp, foul-smelling cells very different from the room where Davos had been confined. Then there was a blank stone wall that turned when Glover pushed on it. Beyond was a long narrow tunnel and still more steps. These led up.</div>

Behind them both stands Symond, clinking coins. That one has bought and paid for several of my servants and two of my knights. One of his wife's handmaids has found her way into the bed of my own fool. If Stannis wonders that my letters say so little, it is because I dare not even trust my maester. Theomore is all head and no heart. You heard him in my hall. Maesters are supposed to put aside old loyalties when they don their chains, but I cannot forget that Theomore was born a Lannister of Lannisport and claims some distant kinship to the Lannisters of Casterly Rock. Foes and false friends are all around me, Lord Davos. They infest my city like roaches, and at night I feel them crawling over me." The fat man's fingers coiled into a fist, and all his chins trembled. "My son Wendel came to the Twins a guest. He ate Lord Walder's bread and salt, and hung his sword upon the wall to feast with friends. And they murdered him. Murdered, I say, and may the Freys choke upon their fables. I drink with Jared, jape with Symond, promise Rhaegar the hand of my own beloved granddaughter… but never think that means I have forgotten. The north remembers, Lord Davos.

When the northmen came to oust him, he put the entire castle to sword, down to the last child, before he himself was slain by Lord Bolton's bastard."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="戴佛斯回想着他们听说的故事。“临冬城被席恩？葛雷乔伊攻占，他过去是史塔克大人的养子。他杀了史塔克家两个年幼的儿子，把他们的脑袋挂在城墙上。当北境人民去撵走他时，他把城堡里所有的人都杀了，包括最小的孩子，然后他自己被波顿的私生子干掉了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Lord Wyman nodded. "The tale you tell is one we all have heard, as full of lies as a pudding's full of raisins. It was the Bastard of Bolton who put Winterfell to the sword… Ramsay Snow, he was called then, before the boy king made him a Bolton. Snow did not kill them all. He spared the women, roped them together, and marched them to the Dreadfort for his sport."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="威曼伯爵点着头。“你说的故事是我们都听说过的版本，里面谎言的含量就像布丁里的葡萄干一样多。是波顿的私生子把临冬城的所有人杀掉的…拉姆斯？雪诺，在男孩国王把波顿的姓赐给他之前，他还叫这个名字。雪诺没杀了所有人，他留下了女人们，用绳子绑在一起，赶回恐怖堡为他的体育运动服务。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He is a great hunter," said Wyman Manderly, "and women are his favorite prey. He strips them naked and sets them loose in the woods. They have a half day's start before he sets out after them with hounds and horns. From time to time some wench escapes and lives to tell the tale. Most are less fortunate. When Ramsay catches them he rapes them, flays them, feeds their corpses to his dogs, and brings their skins back to the Dreadfort as trophies. If they have given him good sport, he slits their throats before he skins them. Elsewise, t'other way around."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他是个好猎手，”威曼曼德勒说，“而女人是他最喜欢的猎物。他把她们的衣服扒光，把她们放到树林中。她们先行半日，然后他就派出猎狗，吹着号角追袭她们。有时候，有些妞儿逃脱了追捕，传播开了这个故事。但是大部分的妞儿没这么幸运。当拉姆斯抓住她们的时候，把她们都强奸了，剥皮了，把她们的尸体喂给狗吃，然后把她们的人皮带回恐怖堡作为战利品。如果她们在体育运动中让他满意，他就在剥皮之前先割了她们的喉咙。否则，反之。”">查看中文翻译</div>

As a boy I loved to ride, and as a young man I handled a mount well enough to win some small acclaim in the lists, but those days are done. My body has become a prison more dire than the Wolf's Den. Even so, I must go to Winterfell. Roose Bolton wants me on my knees, and beneath the velvet courtesy he shows the iron mail. I shall go by barge and litter, attended by a hundred knights and my good friends from the Twins. The Freys came here by sea.
