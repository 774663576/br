<div class="line_en">Lucy, who had been talking to Rhince on the poop, came pattering down the ladder and raced forward. As she went she was joined by Edmund, and they found Caspian, Drinian and Reepicheep already on the forecastle. It was a coldish morning, the sky very pale and the sea very dark blue with little white caps of foam, and there, a little way off on the starboard bow, was the nearest of the Lone Islands, Felimath, like a low green hill in the sea, and behind it, further off, the grey slopes of its sister Doorn.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I shouldn't think it would be much good landing on Felimath," said Edmund. "It was almost uninhabited in our days and it looks as if it was the same still. The people lived mostly on Doorn and a little on Avra -- that's the third one; you can't see it yet. They only kept sheep on Felimath."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我看费利梅斯不见得有什么好码头，”爱德蒙说，“我们那时候这里几乎没人住，看来现在仍然如此。人们多半住在多恩岛，还有些住在阿芙拉岛——那是第三个小岛；你们现在还看不见。人们只是在费利梅斯岛上放放羊罢了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我也喜欢活动活动双腿，”凯斯宾说，“我来告诉你。我们何不划小船上岸，再让小船划回大船，那我们就可以走过费利梅斯岛，让黎明踏浪者号在另一边接我们？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="国王、老鼠、佩文西兄妹和尤斯塔斯一行五人上了救生艇，划到费利梅斯岛的海滩边。救生艇把他们留在岸上后又划回大船那儿去，他们都回过头去看看。只见黎明踏浪者号看上去这么小，不禁感到诧异。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Lucy was of course barefoot, having kicked off her shoes while swimming, but that is no hardship if one is going to walk on downy turf. It was delightful to be ashore again and to smell the earth and grass, even if at first the ground seemed to be pitching up and down like a ship, as it usually does for a while if one has been at sea. It was much warmer here than it had been on board and Lucy found the sand pleasant to her feet as they crossed it. There was a lark singing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="露茜在掉下水游泳时已经踢掉了鞋子，当然光着脚，不过你要是打算在毛茸茸的草皮上走路，那也没什么苦。能再次上岸，闻到土地和野草的香味，真叫人心里高兴，哪怕开头踏在土地上好像还在船里那样上下颠簸也高兴啊，如果你在海上，往往有一阵子会有这种感觉。这里比起船上要暖和得多了，他们走过沙地时，露茜觉得沙地很舒服。有一只云雀在歌唱。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Caspian thanked him, though neither he nor the others much liked the look of their new acquaintance, and all of them sat down. But hardly had they raised their cups to their lips when the black-haired man nodded to his companions and, as quick as lightning, all the five visitors found themselves wrapped in strong arms. There was a moment's struggle but all the advantages were on one side, and soon everyone was disarmed and had their hands tied behind their backs except Reepicheep, writhing in his captor's grip and biting furiously.</div>

He had stopped biting on a threat of having his mouth tied up, but he had a great deal to say, and Lucy really wondered how any man could bear to have the things said to him which were said to the slave dealer by the Mouse. But the slave dealer, far from objecting, only said "Go on" whenever Reepicheep paused for breath, occasionally adding, "It's as good as a play," or, "Blimey, you can't help almost thinking it knows what it's saying!" or "Was it one of you what trained it?"

<div class="line_en">Then they were rowed out to the slave-ship and taken below into a long, rather dark place, none too clean, where they found many other unfortunate prisoners; for Pug was of course a pirate and had just returned from cruising among the islands and capturing what he could. The children didn't meet anyone whom they knew; the prisoners were mostly Galmians and Terebinthians. And there they sat in the straw and wondered what was happening to Caspian and tried to stop Eustace talking as if everyone except himself was to blame.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是这些人被划到奴隶船上，把他们带到船下面一长条挺黑的地方，一点也不干净，他们在那儿看见还有不少倒霉的人被关着，因为普格当然是个海盗，出没在附近各岛屿一带，肆意抓人，才刚回来。这几个孩子没碰到哪个认识的人，被抓的多半是加尔马人和特里宾西亚人。他们就地坐在稻草堆上，暗暗纳闷，不知凯斯宾有什么好歹，还想法阻止尤斯塔斯说怪话，仿佛除了他自己，别人个个都不好似的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Meanwhile Caspian was having a much more interesting time. The man who had bought him led him down a little lane between two of the village houses and so out into an open place behind the village. Then he turned and faced him.</div>

And finally, if your Lordship will give me a sword I will prove on any man's body in clean battle that I am Caspian the son of Caspian, lawful King of Narnia, Lord of Cair Paravel, and Emperor of the Lone Islands."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“首先，看我的长相，”凯斯宾说。“其次，因为我猜六回就能猜中你是谁。你准是我叔叔弥若兹派到海外的七位爵爷中的一位，我这次出来就是寻找他们的——阿尔戈兹、伯恩、奥克特西安、雷斯蒂玛、马夫拉蒙，还有，还有——另外两个人忘了。最后一点，如果您大人肯给我一把剑，我就可以在光明正大的决斗中，在任何人身上证明我是凯斯宾，孤独岛的皇帝、凯尔帕拉维尔的君主、纳尼亚的合法国王老凯斯宾的儿子。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After a little more conversation Caspian and Bern walked down to the coast a little west of the village and there Caspian winded his horn. (This was not the great magic horn of Narnia, Queen Susan's Horn: he had left that at home for his regent Trumpkin to use if any great need fell upon the land in the King's absence.) Drinian, who was on the look-out for a signal, recognized the royal horn at once and the Dawn Treader began standing in to shore. Then the boat put off again and in a few moments Caspian and the Lord Bern were on deck explaining the situation to Drinian. He, just like Caspian, wanted to lay the Dawn Treader alongside the slave-ship at once and board her, but Bern made the same objection.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="再谈了一会儿，凯斯宾和伯恩就走到村子稍北一点的海岸边，凯斯宾当场吹起了号角。（这不是苏珊女王用过的纳尼亚那支魔法无边的号角：他把那支号角留在国内给摄政王杜鲁普金使用，以防国王不在期间，万一有什么急需。）德里宁原来就在瞭望，等着信号，他立即听出这是国王的号角，黎明踏浪者号就开始驶向海岸了。然后又派出救生艇，不一会儿，凯斯宾和伯恩爵爷就在甲板上向德里宁说明了情况。他同凯斯宾一样，也想立刻把黎明踏浪者号靠到那条奴隶船边上，登上船去，但伯恩还是照样不同意。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Not by my counsel," said Bern. "As soon as there was a fight two or three ships would put out from Narrowhaven to rescue Pug. Your Majesty must work by a show of more power than you really have, and by the terror of the King's name. It must not come to plain battle. Gumpas is a chicken-hearted man and can be over-awed."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“依我之见，这不行，”伯恩说，“一旦打起来，狭港方面就会开来两三条船来救普格。陛下必须摆出一副比实际上强大的架势，靠国王名义的威慑力量。千万不要真打。冈帕斯是个胆小鬼，一吓就吓住了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Caspian was sorry for the others languishing in the hold of Pug's slave-ship, but he could not help finding the rest of that day enjoyable. Late in the afternoon (for they had to do all by oar), having turned to starboard round the northeast end of Doorn and port again round the point of Avra, they entered into a good harbour on Avra's southern shore where Bern's pleasant lands sloped down to the water's edge. Bern's people, many of whom they saw working in the fields, were all freemen and it was a happy and prosperous fief. Here they all went ashore and were royally feasted in a low, pillared house overlooking the bay. Bern and his gracious wife and merry daughters made them good cheer. But after dark Bern sent a messenger over by boat to Doorn to order some preparations (he did not say exactly what) for the following day.</div>
