<div class="line_en">Elizabeth needed a new device, one that could perform more than just one class of test. In November 2010, she hired a young engineer named Kent Frankovich and put him in charge of designing it. Kent had just obtained a master's degree in mechanical engineering from Stanford. Before that, he'd spent two years working for NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena where he'd helped build Curiosity, the Mars rover. Kent in turn recruited Greg Baney, a friend he'd met at NASA who'd gone on to work for SpaceX, Elon Musk's Los Angeles-based rocket company. At six feet five and 260 pounds, Greg was built like an NFL lineman, but his physique belied a sharp intellect and a keen sense of observation.</div>

<div class="line_en">With Walgreens and Safeway on board as retail partners, Elizabeth suddenly faced a problem of her own making: she had told both companies her technology could perform hundreds of tests on small blood samples. The truth was that the Edison system could only do immunoassays, a type of test that uses antibodies to measure substances in the blood. Immunoassays included some commonly ordered lab tests such as tests to measure vitamin D or to detect prostate cancer. But many other routine blood tests, ranging from cholesterol to blood sugar, required completely different laboratory techniques.</div>

<div class="line_en">Elizabeth christened the machine she assigned them to build the "miniLab." As its name suggested, her overarching concern was its size: she still nurtured the vision of someday putting it in people's homes and wanted something that could fit on a desk or a shelf. This posed engineering challenges because, in order to run all the tests she wanted, the miniLab would need to have many more components than the Edison. In addition to the Edison's photomultiplier tube, the new device would need to cram three other laboratory instruments in one small space: a spectrophotometer, a cytometer, and an isothermal amplifier.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伊莉莎白把要他们打造的机器取名为迷你实验室（miniLab）。从名称就看得出来，尺寸是首要考量，她仍然怀抱同样的愿景，希望有朝一日进入民众家里，而且尺寸小到可以放在书桌或架上。这是工程上很大的挑战，因为里面的零组件势必比爱迪生多很多，才能运行她所希望的种种检测。除了爱迪生的光电倍增管，还得把另外三种实验室仪器塞进小小空间里：光谱仪（spectrophotometer）、血细胞计数器（cytometer）、等温放大器（isothermal amplifier）。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For a period of several months, Kent and Greg became Elizabeth's favorite employees. She sat in on their brainstorming sessions and made suggestions about what robotics systems they should consider using. She gave them company credit cards and let them charge whatever equipment and supplies they wanted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有好几个月，肯特和葛雷成为伊莉莎白的新宠。她会坐在他们的动脑会议上，建议他们采用哪种机器人系统；她把公司的信用卡交给他们，不管想要什么仪器或设备，直接刷卡付帐就是。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">None of these were new inventions. The first commercial spectrophotometer was developed in 1941 by the American chemist Arnold Beckman, founder of the lab equipment maker Beckman Coulter. It works by beaming rays of colored light through a blood sample and measuring how much of the light the sample absorbs. The concentration of a molecule in the blood is then inferred from the level of light absorption. Spectrophotometers are used to measure substances like cholesterol, glucose, and hemoglobin. Cytometry, a way of counting blood cells, was invented in the nineteenth century. It's used to diagnose anemia and blood cancers, among other disorders.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这三种仪器都不是新发明。第一台商用光谱仪在一九四一年由美国化学家阿诺．贝克曼（Arnold Beckman）所研发，阿诺．贝克曼是实验室器材制造商贝克曼库尔特（Beckman Coulter）创办人。其运作原理是对着血液样本发射彩色光线，测量样本吸收了多少光线，再根据光线吸收的多寡来推断血液中的分子浓度，这种方法可用于检测胆固醇、葡萄糖、血红素等物质。血细胞计数器则是计算血球数量的方法，发明于十九世纪，用于诊断贫血症和血癌等疾病。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Greg spent a lot of time studying commercial instruments made by diagnostics equipment makers to reverse engineer them and make them smaller. He ordered a spectrophotometer from a company called Ocean Optics and broke it apart to understand how it worked. It turned into an interesting project, but it made him question their approach.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="葛雷花了很多时间研究诊疗设备厂商所制造的商用仪器，以反向工程拆解研究，再设法缩小。他向海洋光学（Ocean Optics）订购了一台光谱仪，然后将它拆解开来了解内部运作，这变成很有趣的工作，但也让他开始质疑他们的方法。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Laboratories all over the world had been using these instruments for decades. In other words, Theranos wasn't pioneering any new ways to test blood. Rather, the miniLab's value would lie in the miniaturization of existing lab technology. While that might not amount to groundbreaking science, it made sense in the context of Elizabeth's vision of taking blood testing out of central laboratories and bringing it to drugstores, supermarkets, and, eventually, people's homes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些仪器在全球各地实验室已使用数十年，换句话说，Theranos并没有开创什么新方法。「迷你实验室」的价值只在于将现有技术微型化。话又说回来，虽然称不上开创性科学，但是以伊莉莎白的愿景脉络来看——把血液检测从实验室带出来，引进药局、超市，最终进入家庭——仍然很有意义。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">To be sure, there were already portable blood analyzers on the market. One of them, a device that looked like a small ATM called the Piccolo Xpress, could perform thirty-one different blood tests and produce results in as little as twelve minutes. It required only three or four drops of blood for a panel of a half dozen commonly ordered tests. However, neither the Piccolo nor other existing portable analyzers could do the entire range of laboratory tests. In Elizabeth's mind, that was going to be the miniLab's selling point.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没错，市场上已经有可携式血液分析仪，其中一个外型类似ATM设备，称为Piccolo Xpress，可运行三十一种血液检测，十二分钟就有结果，其中有五、六种常见检测只需要三、四滴血液就能进行。不过，Piccolo Xpress和其他现有可携式分析仪并不能运行实验室所有检测，伊莉莎白认为这是「迷你实验室」的卖点。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Instead of building new instruments from scratch to fit the arbitrary dimensions Elizabeth had laid out, Greg felt they would do better to take the off-the-shelf components they were laboring to miniaturize and integrate them together to test how the overall system worked. Once they had a working prototype, they could then worry about shrinking it. Emphasizing the system's size first and how it worked later was putting the cart before the horse. But Elizabeth wouldn't budge.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="葛雷认为，与其从无到有打造新仪器来满足伊莉莎白任性订下的规格，不如把他们现在费尽心思要微型化的现成零组件组合起来，测试看看能不能用，等到做出能用的原型机，再来伤脑筋如何缩小。先强调尺寸再研究能不能用，是本末倒置的做法。但是伊莉莎白不会让步。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Greg was in the midst of a breakup with the girl he'd dated in L. A., so he came to the office on Saturdays to get his mind off it. He could see that Elizabeth really appreciated that. She saw it as a sign of loyalty and dedication. She told Greg she wanted to see Kent come in on weekends too; it bothered her that his friend didn't. Keeping a work-life balance seemed a foreign concept to her. She was at work all the time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当时，葛雷刚跟住在洛杉矶的女友分手，为了转移心思，他每周六都会进公司。他看得出来伊莉莎白很喜欢他周末上班，她视之为忠诚和投入的表现，她跟葛雷说希望肯特也能跟进，无奈他的朋友并没有。这点很令她恼怒，工作和生活取得平衡对她似乎是个外来观念，她随时在工作。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Like most people, Greg had been taken aback by Elizabeth's deep voice when he'd first met her. He soon began to suspect it was affected. One evening, as they wrapped up a meeting in her office shortly after he joined the company, she lapsed into a more natural-sounding young woman's voice. "I'm really glad you're here," she told him as she got up from her chair, her pitch several octaves higher than usual.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="跟多数人一样，葛雷第一次见到伊莉莎白也很惊讶她低沉的嗓音，但没多久他就开始怀疑那是装的。刚加入公司不久的某天晚上，他们刚结束在她办公室的会议，她不知不觉用起年轻女子较自然的嗓音说「很高兴你加入」，一面从椅子上起身，声音比平常高了好几个八度。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A few weeks after the voice incident, Greg picked up another clue that Theranos wasn't your usual workplace. He had become friendly with Gary Frenzel. Although Gary looked like a slob -- he weighed three hundred pounds and walked around the office in baggy jeans, an oversized T-shirt, and Crocs -- Greg found him to be one of the smartest people at the company.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="嗓音事件过了几周后，葛雷注意到另一个迹象，透露出Theranos并非寻常公司。当时，他和盖瑞．法兰佐已经成为好友。盖瑞虽然外表邋遢，拖着一百三十六公斤的庞大身躯，穿着大一号的T恤、松垮牛仔裤和布希鞋（Crocs）在办公室晃来晃去，但葛雷发现他是这家公司最聪明的人之一。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As they walked out of the office together one day, Gary lowered his voice and in a conspiratorial tone told Greg something that startled the younger man: Elizabeth and Sunny were in a romantic relationship. Greg felt blindsided. He thought it was inappropriate for the CEO of a company and its number-two executive to be sleeping together, but what bothered him more was the fact they were hiding it. This was a crucial piece of information that he felt should have been disclosed to new recruits. For Greg, the revelation cast everything about Theranos in a new light: If Elizabeth wasn't being forthright about that, what else might she be lying about?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="某天他们一同走出办公室，盖瑞压低嗓音用鬼鬼祟祟的语气跟葛雷说了一件事，令这位小老弟惊讶不已：伊莉莎白和桑尼是恋人。葛雷觉得仿佛被人偷袭，他认为公司首席执行官和第二号高层相拥而眠是不妥的，不过他们的隐瞒用心更令他不舒服，他觉得这种重要消息应该跟新进同事透露才对。对葛雷来说，这次发现给了他一个新角度来看Theranos：如果伊莉莎白对这件事并不坦诚，那她是不是还瞒着其他事？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Gary had a bad case of sleep apnea and, more than once during meetings, Greg had watched him doze off only to suddenly snap awake to refute a dumb idea someone had put forward and suggest a brilliant alternative.</div>

<div class="line_en">In her excitement, she seemed to have momentarily forgotten to turn on the baritone. When Greg thought about it, there was a certain logic to her act: Silicon Valley was overwhelmingly a man's world. The VCs were all male and he couldn't think of any prominent female startup founder. At some point, she must have decided the deep voice was necessary to get people's attention and be taken seriously.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="由于太过兴奋，她似乎暂时忘了换上男中音嗓音。对此，葛雷认为她的行为背后有一定的逻辑。硅谷毕竟是男性主导的世界，创投清一色是男性，他也想不出有哪位杰出创业家是女性，伊莉莎白想必在某个时刻做了决定，必须这样做才能引人注意、被当一回事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">NEPOTISM AT THERANOS took on a new dimension in the spring of 2011 when Elizabeth hired her younger brother, Christian, as associate director of product management. Christian Holmes was two years out of college and had no clear qualifications to work at a blood diagnostics company, but that mattered little to Elizabeth. What mattered far more was that her brother was someone she could trust.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="二〇一一年春天，Theranos的裙带关系来到新境界，伊莉莎白雇用弟弟克利斯勤担任产品管理部副理。克利斯勤大学毕业刚两年，学经历明显不够资格在血液诊断公司工作，不过这对伊莉莎白并不重要，重点是弟弟是她可以信任的人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Christian was a handsome young man with eyes the same deep shade of blue as his sister's, but that was where the similarities between them began and ended. Christian had none of his sister's ambition and drive; he was a regular guy who liked to watch sports, chase girls, and party with friends. After graduating from Duke University in 2009, he'd worked as an analyst at a Washington, D. C., firm that advised corporations about best practices.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克利斯勤英俊年轻，跟姊姊一样有着湛蓝双眼，不过两人相似之处仅止于此。克利斯勤丝毫没有姊姊的野心和动力，他是个很普通的男生，喜欢看运动比赛、把妹、跟朋友跑趴。二〇〇九年从杜克大学（Duke University）毕业后，在华盛顿特区一家企管顾问公司做过分析师。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When he first arrived at the company, Christian didn't have much to do, so he spent part of his days reading about sports. He hid it by cutting and pasting articles from the ESPN website into empty emails so that, from afar, it looked like he was absorbed in work-related correspondence. Christian soon recruited four of his fraternity brothers from Duke: Jeff Blickman, Nick Menchel, Dan Edlin, and Sani Hadziahmetovic. They were later joined by a fifth Duke friend, Max Fosque. They rented a house together near the Palo Alto country club and became known inside Theranos as "the Frat Pack." Like Christian, none of the other Duke boys had any experience or training relevant to blood testing or medical devices, but their friendship with Elizabeth's brother vaulted them above most other employees in the company hierarchy.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Frat Pack endeared itself to Sunny and Elizabeth by working long days. Sunny was constantly questioning employees' commitment to the company -- the number of hours a person put in at the office, whether he or she was doing productive work or not, was his ultimate gauge of that commitment.

To elude Sunny's watchful gaze, they ducked out of the building at different times using different exits. They were also careful never to return at the same time or together.

<div class="line_en">Several members of the Frat Pack joined Greg and two of his colleagues from the engineering department for lunch on the big terrace overlooking the parking lot one day. A discussion about the low IQs of some of the world's top soccer players led them to debate the question, Would you rather be smart and poor or dumb and rich? The three engineers all chose smart and poor, while the Frat Pack voted unanimously for dumb and rich. Greg was struck by how clearly the line was drawn between the two groups.

At one point, she'd told him that a documentary espousing a 9/11 conspiracy theory wouldn't have been available on iTunes if "Steve" hadn't believed there was something to it.

Their eagerness to please was on display when news broke that Steve Jobs had died on the evening of October 5, 2011. Elizabeth and Sunny wanted to pay Jobs a tribute by flying an Apple flag at half-mast on the grounds of the Hillview Avenue building. The next morning, Jeff Blickman, a tall redhead who'd played varsity baseball at Duke, volunteered for the mission. He couldn't locate any suitable Apple flag for sale, so Blickman had one custom made out of vinyl. It featured the famous Apple logo in white against a black background. The store he went to took a while to make it. Blickman didn't return with it until late in the day.

After interviewing with both Elizabeth and Sunny in April 2011, she received an offer to join the product management team the following month but decided to turn it down and stay with her employer, the accounting firm PwC. The next day, a Saturday, Greg was at the office working. Elizabeth was there too but wouldn't acknowledge his presence, which he found odd since she usually made a point to, especially on weekends. The following week, Greg stopped being invited to her brainstorming sessions with Kent. It dawned on him that she'd taken his sister's decision personally and that he was now paying the price for it.</div>

<div class="line_en">Not long after, a chill descended on Kent's own relationship with Elizabeth. For all intents and purposes, Kent was the chief architect of the miniLab. A talented engineer who loved to build stuff, he was also dabbling with a side project in his spare time: bicycle lights that lit up both wheels and the road, providing improved visibility and safety for the rider at night. He'd pitched the concept on Kickstarter and, much to his surprise, was able to raise $215,000 in forty-five days. It was the seventh-largest sum raised on the crowdfunding platform that year. What had been a hobby suddenly looked like it could become a viable business.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过没多久，肯特和伊莉莎白的关系也陷入急冻。实际上，肯特是「迷你实验室」的总工程师，天资聪颖的他，喜欢动手做东西，私下空闲时也有设计案在进行：可照亮车轮和道路的脚踏车灯，增强夜间骑士的能见度和安全。他把这个概念推销到Kickstarter群众募资平台，四十五天就募到二十一万五千美元，是Kickstarter那一年募资金额第七高，令他又惊又喜，原本只是一个嗜好，却突然有可能成为一项生意。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Kent told Elizabeth about his successful Kickstarter campaign, thinking she wouldn't mind. But he badly miscalculated: she and Sunny were furious. They viewed it as a major conflict of interest and asked him to transfer his bike-lights patent to Theranos. The paperwork Kent had signed when he joined the company entitled them to any intellectual property he produced while employed there, they contended. Kent disagreed. He'd worked on his little venture during his free time and felt he had done nothing wrong. He also failed to see how a new type of bicycle light posed a threat to a maker of blood-testing equipment. But Elizabeth and Sunny wouldn't let it go. In meeting after meeting, they tried to get him to turn over the patent. They ratcheted up the pressure by bringing Theranos's new senior counsel, David Doyle, to some of the meetings.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="肯特把他成功募资的消息告诉伊莉莎白，以为她不会介意，没想到他严重错估。伊莉莎白和桑尼气炸了，他们认为这是严重的利益冲突，要求他把脚踏车灯的专利移转给Theranos。他们坚决主张，肯特进公司时签了文档，同意他任职期间产出的智能财产全部授予他们。肯特不认同，他的小事业是利用空闲时间做的，没有任何不对，更何况，他看不出一种新的脚踏车灯会对血液检测仪器制造商产生什么威胁。但是伊莉莎白和桑尼不肯罢手，经过一次又一次会议，他们不断试图要他交出专利权，甚至有几次会议还请来公司新聘任的资深律师大卫．道伊尔（David Doyle），加大施压力道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Kent's departure put Elizabeth in a foul mood. She now looked to Greg and others to pick up the slack. Greg also sensed a growing urgency in Elizabeth and Sunny's behavior. They seemed to be squeezing the engineering team to meet some sort of deadline without communicating to them what that deadline was. They must have promised someone something, he thought.</div>

<div class="line_en">As he watched the standoff unfold, Greg became convinced that it wasn't so much about the patent as it was about punishing Kent for his perceived disloyalty. Elizabeth expected her employees to give their all to Theranos, especially ones like Kent whom she entrusted with big responsibilities. Not only had Kent not given his all, he'd devoted part of his time and energy to another engineering project. It explained why he hadn't been coming in on weekends like she wanted him to. As she saw it, Kent had betrayed her. In the end, a fragile compromise was reached: Kent would go on a leave of absence to give his bicycle-light venture a shot. When he was done indulging his pet project, they'd have a conversation about whether, and under what conditions, he could return.</div>

<div class="line_en">Six weeks later, they were back at the Fogarty Winery, this time to celebrate the Safeway alliance. Standing on the deck of the open-air events house, Elizabeth harangued employees for forty-five minutes as the fog rolled in, like General Patton addressing his troops before the Allied landings. The sweeping view before them was appropriate, she said, because Theranos was about to become Silicon Valley's dominant company. Toward the end she boasted, "I'm not afraid of anything," adding after a brief pause, "except needles."</div>

<div class="line_en">Part of the problem was that Elizabeth and Sunny seemed unable, or unwilling, to distinguish between a prototype and a finished product. The miniLab Greg was helping build was a prototype, nothing more. It needed to be tested thoroughly and fine-tuned, which would require time. A lot of time. Most companies went through three cycles of prototyping before they went to market with a product. But Sunny was already placing orders for components to build one hundred miniLabs, based on a first, untested prototype. It was as if Boeing built one plane and, without doing a single flight test, told airline passengers, "Hop aboard."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="问题之一是，伊莉莎白和桑尼似乎无法（或不愿意）区别原型机和完成品的差别。葛雷协助建造的「迷你实验室」是原型机，仅此而已，还需要彻底周全的测试和微调，这需要时间，很多时间。大多数公司会经过三轮原型机阶段，才将产品上市，但是桑尼却已经下单购买零组件，打算以第一台未经测试的原型机为蓝图，制造一百台「迷你实验室」。这就好像波音公司建造出一架飞机，连一次试飞都没有就告诉乘客：「来登机吧！」">查看中文翻译</div>

Instead, he'd focused his advice on the merits of a career in Silicon Valley.</div>
