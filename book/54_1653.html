<div class="line_en">"Cassie, what's the matter with you, girl!" Big Ma asked as she thrust three sticks of dried pine into the stove to rekindle the dying morning fire. "You sure are takin' a sorrowful long time to churn that butter."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“凯西，你怎么啦？”奶奶一边把三根树枝放到火炉里，点燃火焰，一边担心着我，“你搅拌奶油的时候看起来好痛苦。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Big Ma reached out and felt my forehead, then my cheeks. Frowning, she pulled her hand away as Mama entered the kitchen. "Mary, feel this child's face," she said. "She seem warm to you!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="奶奶走过来，探了探我额头的温度，又摸了摸我的脸颊。她皱了皱眉，放开了手。这时妈妈正好走进了厨房。“玛丽，你过来摸摸她的脸，”奶奶说，“她是不是发烧了？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I was on the verge of blurting out the awful truth about the bus and the men in the night, but then I remembered the pact Stacey had made us all swear to when I had told him, Christopher-John, and Little Man about the caravan and I said instead, "No, ma'am," and began to churn again. Abruptly, Mama took hold of the churning stick, her eyes searching mine. As she studied me, she seemed about to ask me something, then the question faded and she pulled away, lifting the lid of the churn."It looks ready now," she said with a sigh. "Dip out the butter like I showed you and wash it down. I'll take care of the milk."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我差点儿就跟妈妈说昨晚车队的事情了。但我想到昨晚我和男孩们说起这件事，斯泰西让我们守口如瓶时，我就忍住了。“没有啊。”我含糊过去，继续搅拌着奶油。妈妈突然抓住我搅拌奶油的棒子，望向我的眼睛，似乎想问我些什么。但最后，她还是一句话也没说。“看起来好了。”她掀开奶油盖子，“像我之前教你的，把奶油舀出来，放到模子里。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh, Lord, no, child," Big Ma exclaimed hastily. "I checked in there right after they passed and she was sound asleep. She couldn't've seen them old devils. The boys neither."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，天哪，不会的！”奶奶急忙否定了妈妈的这个想法，“那天他们一走，我就去看凯西，她睡得很沉，不是吗？她不可能看到那些恶魔的，男孩们也是。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I scooped the butter from the churning lid onto a plate and went through the curtain to the small pantry off the kitchen to get the molding dish. It had been placed on a high shelf under several other dishes and I had to stand on a stool to get it. As I eased it out, Mama and Big Ma spoke softly in worried tones on the other side of the curtain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我把奶油舀到盘子里，然后穿过帘子到厨房里取模具。模具放在很高的架子上，压在其他盘子下面，我必须站在凳子上才能拿到它。我刚站上去，就听到妈妈和奶奶隔着帘子用担忧的语气轻声说话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No'm," I mumbled, feeling very clumsy and close to tears. I knew that if I let the tears fall.

So instead of crying, I jumped up quickly and began to pick up the broken pieces of the dish.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没事。”我喃喃道，感觉到一阵难过，快要哭出来了。但是我知道，如果我哭了，妈妈一定会怀疑我的。我可不是个爱哭鬼，才不会为摔倒这种傻事哭呢。我很快爬了起来，去捡盘子的碎片。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“可是，妈妈——”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I stared up at Mama, wondering if she would ever know what we had done, then joined the boys who were sitting listlessly around the fire absently listening to T. J.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我注视着妈妈，心想她是不是知道些什么。我走到男孩们那里，他们正在心不在焉地听着提杰讲话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"See, fellows, there's a system to getting out of work," T. J. was expounding as I sat down. "Jus' don't be 'round when it's got to be done. Only thing is, you can't let your folks know that's what you're doin'. See, you should do like me. Like this mornin' when Mama wanted to bring back them scissors she borrowed from Miz Logan, I ups and volunteers so she don't have to make this long trip down here, she bein' so busy and all. And naturally when I got here, y'all wanted me to stay awhile and talk to y'all, so what could I do! I couldn't be impolite, could I! And by the time I finally convince y'all I gotta go, all the work'll be done at home." T. J. chuckled with satisfaction. "Yeah, you just have to use the old brain, that's all."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嘿，哥们儿，告诉你们一个逃避工作的法子吧。”当我坐下时，提杰正在口若悬河，“即使有工作，也不要在那里转悠。还有，别让别人知道你在做什么。看看我吧，今天早上妈妈想把剪刀还给洛根太太，我就自告奋勇说要帮忙去送。然后我就来了这里，你们总会留下我来聊聊天，我怎么办？总不能没礼貌吧？等到我回去的时候，家里的活基本上都被做完了。”提杰露出得意的笑容，“多动动脑筋吧，你们。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Then don't!" said Stacey with smooth finality, turning back toward the fire as if he cared not at all about the night men.

<div class="line_cn" title="“那算了！”斯泰西一副满不在乎的模样，把头转向了火炉。我知道斯泰西是故意的，便用手肘碰了碰克里斯托弗，克里斯托弗碰了碰小家伙，我们三个人都装作毫无兴趣地看着炉火。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Without a captive audience. T. J. had to reinterest us by getting to the point. "Well, 'bout a week ago, they rode down to Mr. Sam Tatum's place -- you know, down the Jackson Road toward Strawberry -- and you know what they done!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没人认真听，提杰只能先说一些重点来吸引我们：“好吧，一个星期前，他们去了山姆·泰纳姆那里——你们知道吧？从杰克逊路下去，到斯特罗贝里那儿，你知道他们做了什么吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
