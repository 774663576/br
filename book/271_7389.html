<div class="line_en">We took a winding path through the eastern mountains. It was a familiar route. We'd run these mountains when the vampires had left a year ago, making it part of our patrol route to better protect the people here. Then we'd pulled back the lines when the Cullens returned. This was their treaty land.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们迂回着向东面的山头跑去。这条路线我们并不陌生。一年前为了把入侵的吸血鬼扫地出门，我们跑遍了这些山头，为了更好地保护这里的人们，还把这条路线做为日常巡逻的一部分。当Cullen一家回来以后，我们才撤了出去。因为根据契约这里是他们的地盘。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But that fact would probably mean nothing to Sam now. The treaty was dead. The question today was how thin he was willing to spread his force.

<div class="line_en">Not to be outdone, I swooped down on the next largest deer, snapping her neck between my jaws quickly, so she wouldn't feel unnecessary pain. I could feel Leah's disgust warring with her hunger, and I tried to make it easier for her by letting the wolf in me have my head. I'd lived all-wolf for long enough that I knew how to be the animal completely, to see his way and think his way. I let the practical instincts take over, letting her feel that, too. She hesitated for a second, but then, tentatively, she seemed to reach out with her mind and try to see my way. It felt very strange -- our minds were more closely linked than they had ever been before, because we both were trying to think together.</div>
