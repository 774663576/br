<div class="line_en">The first thing to attract Wang's attention was the strange device at the center of the cafeteria. Three silver spheres, each slightly smaller than a bowling ball, hovered and swirled over a metal base. Wang guessed the device was probably based on magnetic levitation.

The factory had already been moved elsewhere, and the interior of the building, which was about to be demolished, was worn out but spacious.

I had his kidney donated to a Palestinian girl suffering kidney failure as an expression of my hope that the two peoples could live together in peace. For this ideal, I was willing to give my life. Many, many Israelis and Palestinians sincerely strove toward the same goal by my side. But all this was useless. Our home remained trapped in the quagmire of cycles of vengeance. Eventually, I lost hope in the human race and joined the ETO. Desperation turned me from a pacifist into an extremist. Also, probably because I donated so much money to the Organization, I became a core member of the Adventists. Let me tell you now, the Adventists have their own secret agenda. And it is this: The human race is an evil species. Human civilization has committed unforgivable crimes against the Earth and must be punished. The ultimate goal of the Adventists is to ask our Lord to carry out this divine punishment: the destruction of all humankind."</div>

<div class="line_en">"You can see that most people attending this meeting are comrades from the Redemptionist faction. I trust that the few Adventists who are here will stand on the side of the Organization. But men like Evans and you can no longer be saved. To protect the program and ideals of the ETO, we must completely solve the problem of the Adventists."</div>

<div class="line_en">Pan's face changed. He stuck a hand inside the lapel of his jacket, but the young woman dashed quicker than the eye could follow. Before anyone could react, she wrapped one of her slender arms around Pan's neck, placed her other hand on top of his head, and, by applying her unexpected strength at just the right angle, she twisted Pan's head 180 degrees with practiced ease. The cracks from his cervical vertebrae breaking stood out against the complete silence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="潘寒脸色骤变，一手伸进胸前的外衣里，但那少女闪电般冲过来，旁人还没明白怎么回事，她已经用一条看上去如春藤般柔软的玉臂夹住了潘寒的脖颈，另一只手放在他的头顶上，以她不可能具有的力量和极其精巧的受力角度，熟练地将潘寒的头颅扭转了一百八十度，寂静中颈椎折断的咔嚓声清晰可闻。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Ah, Xiao Wang, you're here too. How have you been?" Ye's gaze fell on Wang Miao. She smiled kindly at him and nodded. Then she turned to the others. "This is Professor Wang, a member of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and my friend. He researches nanomaterials. This is the first technology our Lord wishes to extinguish from the Earth."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，小汪也来了，你好。”叶文洁的目光落到了汪森身上，向他亲切地散笑着点点头，然后对其他人说，“这是国家科学院院士汪淼教授，我的朋友。他研究纳米材料，这是主首先要在地球扑灭的技术。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Silence returned. A few moments later, one of the bodyguards near Ye, a young woman, smiled. She walked toward Pan Han casually.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="沉默再次降临。两三分钟后，叶文洁护卫中的一员，一名苗条美丽的少女动人地笑了笑，那笑容是鄢么醒目，将很多人的目光引向了她。少女袅袅婷婷地向潘寒走去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The young woman's hands immediately let go, as though Pan's head was too hot. Pan fell to the ground, and the gun that had killed Shen Yufei slid under the table. His body still spasmed, and his eyes remained open, his tongue sticking out. But his head no longer moved, as though it were never a part of the rest of his body. Several men came and dragged him away, the blood oozing from his mouth leaving a long trail.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="少女两手同时快速松开，好像那个头颅发烫似的。潘寒倒在地上，那枝杀死了申玉菲的手枪滑到了桌子下面。他的躯体仍在抽搐，双眼暴出舌头吐了好长，但头颅却一动不动，仿佛从来就没有属于过那个躯体。几个人把他拖了出去，他口中吐出的血在地上拖了长长的—道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ye slowly approached the three-body model, seemingly absorbed by the swirling silver spheres. Through the broken window, the setting sun's light fell on the model, and the flying spheres intermittently reflected the light onto the rebel commander, like sparks from a bonfire.</div>
