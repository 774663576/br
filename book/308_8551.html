<div class="line_en">I was to have a further proof that day of the success of Poirot's tactics. That challenge of his had been a subtle touch born of his knowledge of human nature. A mixture of fear and guilt had wrung the truth from Mrs Ackroyd. She was the first to react.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I tried to make him wait," said Caroline, "but he said he would call back at The Larches in half an hour, and went away down the village. A great pity, because M. Poirot came in practically the minute after he left."</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a most subtle parting shot. I wanted dreadfully to understand the enigma of the boots. When the old lady with the Breton cap opened the door to me, I found myself asking if M. Poirot was in, quite automatically.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这招不可谓不高明。我也迫不及待地想解开靴子之谜。那位头戴布列塔尼帽的老妇人前来开门，我忍不住问波洛先生在不在家。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“卡洛琳小姐真是太客气了，答应过的事记得这么牢。那第二件呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It clears the ground," he said thoughtfully. "And it has a certain value as confirming the evidence of the housekeeper. She said, you remember, that she found the silver table lid open and closed it down in passing."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这就说得通了，”他沉吟道，“而且也有助于核实女管家的证词。还记得吗，她自称路过时发现银桌的盖子敞开着，于是顺手关上了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“她还说去客厅是为了查看鲜花的新鲜程度，你觉得呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Ah! we never took that very seriously, did we, my friend? It was patently an excuse, trumped up in a hurry, by a woman who felt it urgent to explain her presence -- which, by the way, you would probably never have thought of questioning. I considered it possible that her agitation might arise from the fact that she had been tampering with the silver table, but I think now that we must look for another cause."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，对这一段我们从没当真，对吧，我的朋友？她显然急于解释出现在客厅的理由，情急之下才捏造出这个借口——不过话说回来，你可能没把这事放在心上。我原本揣测，她那么紧张是因为对银桌动过手脚，但现在看来另有隐情。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“对了，”我说，“我姐姐托我捎条口信。拉尔夫·佩顿的靴子是黑色的，不是棕色的。”我边说边审视着他。不知是不是幻觉，一瞬间，他的神情有些不安。但即便是真的，那一丝不安也稍纵即逝了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For answer, the little man rose and crossed the room to where newspapers were filed. He brought me a copy of the Daily Budget, dated Friday, 16th September, and showed me an article dealing with the smuggling of cocaine. It was a somewhat lurid article, written with an eye to picturesque effect.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他没有直接回答，而是起身走到房间另一头归档的报纸前，拿过来一份九月十六日星期五的《每日预算报》，示意我读一读上面一篇关于可卡因走私的文章。文章的内容骇人听闻，描写也很生动。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，其实不算什么大事，真的。但是，说真心话，我从昨天下午开始就饱受良心的折磨。您指责我们大家都有所隐瞒，波洛先生，我认错。我的确有隐情没坦白。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I would have catechized him further, for I did not quite understand his meaning, but at that moment the door opened and Geoffrey Raymond was announced.</div>

But I was a fool, really, because Blunt and I were in the billiard room from a quarter to ten onwards, so I've got a watertight alibi and nothing to fear. Still, when you thundered out that stuff about concealing things, I felt a nasty prick of conscience, and I thought I'd like to get it off my mind." He got up again and stood smiling at us.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“您也明白，警察的疑心都很重——我不想承认自己缺钱花——要不肯定会被他们盯上。可我实在是冒傻气，从九点四十五分开始我一直和布兰特待在台球室，我的不在场证明无懈可击，没什么好怕的。但是，既然您对我隐瞒实情这么生气，我受不了良心的谴责，还是坦白交代为好。”他又站起身，冲我们一笑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You are a very wise young man," said Poirot, nodding at him with approval. "See you, when I know that anyone is hiding things from me, I suspect that the thing hidden may be something very bad indeed. You have done well."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes," agreed Poirot. "A mere bagatelle -- but if he had not been in the billiard room -- who knows? After all, many crimes have been committed for the sake of less than five hundred pounds. It all depends on what sum is sufficient to break a man. A question of relativity, is it not so? Have you reflected, my friend, that many people in that house stood to benefit by Mr Ackroyd's death? Mrs Ackroyd, Miss Flora, young Mr Raymond, the housekeeper. Miss Russell. Only one, in fact, does not. Major Blunt." His tone in uttering that name was so peculiar that I looked up, puzzled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嗯，”波洛也说，“几乎不值一提。但如果他不在台球室里，天知道会怎样？许多凶杀案背后的动机还不足五百镑。这取决于多少钱才足以令人铤而走险，钱多钱少都是相对的，是吧？你想过吗，我的朋友，那座大宅里的很多人都从艾克罗伊德先生之死中获得了好处。艾克罗伊德太太，弗洛拉小姐，年轻的雷蒙德先生，女管家拉塞尔小姐。事实上，没能从中受益的只有一个人，就是布兰特少校。”他提到布兰特时的语气相当反常，我不由抬头看了看他，有点糊涂。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Poirot nodded energetically. "Very good. Very good indeed. I wondered if that idea would come to you. Of course it is possible. But we must remember one point. The letter disappeared. Still, that, as you say, may not necessarily mean that the murderer took it. When you first found the body, Parker may have abstracted the letter unnoticed by you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="波洛使劲点头。“非常好，实在太好了。我还以为你想不到这一层。这当然有可能。但必须牢记一点：那封信失踪了。当然，你说得没错，拿走那封信的人未必是凶手。当你首先发现尸体时，帕克就有可能趁你不注意把信拿走。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Parker might have taken the letter," I admitted. "It wasn't till later that I noticed it was gone."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“过了多久才发现？是在布兰特和雷蒙德进屋之前还是之后？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, Parker. I always come back to Parker -- not as the murderer -- no, he did not commit the murder; but who is more suitable than he as the mysterious scoundrel who terrorized Mrs Ferrars? He may have got his information about Mr Ferrars's death from one of the King's Paddock servants. At any rate, he is more likely to have come upon it than a casual guest such as Blunt, for instance."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对，帕克。我总免不了想到帕克，虽然我并不认为他是凶手。不，人不是他杀的，但还有谁比他更像是勒索弗拉尔斯太太的那个神秘恶棍呢？他很可能从金斯帕多克的某个仆人口中打探出了弗拉尔斯先生的死因。无论如何，比起偶然来访的客人，比方说布兰特这样的，帕克的可能性更大。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Perhaps you would fetch the tray or whatever it was you were carrying?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Mademoiselle Flora," said Poirot, "I have to confide in you a little secret. I am not yet satisfied of the innocence of Parker. I propose to make a little experiment with your assistance. I want to reconstruct some of his actions on that night. But we must think of something to tell him -- ah! I have it. I wish to satisfy myself as to whether voices in the little lobby could have been heard outside on the terrace. Now, ring for Parker, if you will be so good." I did so, and presently the butler appeared, suave as ever.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“弗洛拉小姐，”波洛说，“我不得不向您透露一个小秘密。我仍然不相信帕克是清白的，所以想请您配合做个小实验。我准备重建他当晚的部分行动，但得编个故事来骗他——啊！有了，就说我们想确认在外面的露台上能不能听见小门廊里的声音。好吧，麻烦你按铃找帕克来。”我按吩咐行事，男管家很快就出现了，一如既往地殷勤。">查看中文翻译</div>
