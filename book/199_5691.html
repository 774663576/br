<div class="line_en">Harry had no idea how long a bath he would need to work out the secret of the golden egg, he decided to do it at night, when he would be able to take as much time as he wanted. Reluctant though he was to accept more favors from Cedric, he also decided to use the prefects' bathroom; far fewer people were allowed in there, so it was much less likely that he would be disturbed.</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry planned his excursion carefully, because he had been caught out of bed and out-of-bounds by Filch the caretaker in the middle of the night once before, and had no desire to repeat the experience. The Invisibility Cloak would, of course, be essential, and as an added precaution, Harry thought he would take the Marauders Map, which, next to the cloak, was the most useful aid to rule-breaking Harry owned. The map showed the whole of Hogwarts, including its many shortcuts and secret passageways and, most important of all, it revealed the people inside the castle as minuscule, labeled dots, moving around the corridors, so that Harry would be forewarned if somebody was approaching the bathroom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利仔细筹划着他的这次行动，以前他因为半夜起床到处乱逛被看门人费尔奇抓住过一回，他不希望这种经历重演。隐形衣自然是不可缺少的，但为了保险起见，哈利还想带上活点地图。活点地图重要性仅次于隐形衣，是哈利违反校规时最有用的铺助工具。地图上显示出霍格沃茨的全景，包括许多错综复杂的捷径和秘密通道。最重要的一点，它还用标着名字的小点显示城堡里的人在走廊里走动的情况，这样，如果有人走近洗澡间，哈利就会预先得到警告。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The door creaked open. Harry slipped inside, bolted the door behind him, and pulled off the Invisibility Cloak, looking around.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was awkward moving under the cloak tonight, because Harry had the heavy egg under one arm and the map held in front of his nose with the other. However, the moonlit corridors were empty and silent, and by checking the map at strategic intervals, Harry was able to ensure that he wouldn't run into anyone he wanted to avoid. When he reached the statue of Boris the Bewildered, a lost-looking wizard with his gloves on the wrong hands, he located the right door, leaned close to it, and muttered the password, "Pine fresh," just as Cedric had told him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="今天夜里，哈利穿着隐形衣行动非常别扭，因为他一只胳膊下夹着沉重的金蛋，另一只胳膊还要举着地图凑到鼻子底下。还好，月光映照在走廊里空荡荡的，非常安静，哈利在几个关键的地方都查看了地图，确保自己不会撞见任何人。他来到糊涂波里斯的雕像前——这是一个表情茫然的巫师，两只手上的手套戴反了。哈利像塞德里克告诉他的那样，找到雕像旁边的那扇门，靠上去低声说出了那个口令：“新鲜凤梨。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On Thursday night, Harry sneaked up to bed, put on the cloak, crept back downstairs, and, just as he had done on the night when Hagrid had shown him the dragons, waited for the portrait hole to open. This time it was Ron who waited outside to give the Fat Lady the password ("banana fritters"), "Good luck," Ron muttered, climbing into the room as Harry crept out past him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="星期四夜里，哈利偷偷从床上起来，穿上隐形衣，蹑手蹑脚地溜下楼梯，然后就像海格带他去看火龙的那天夜里一样，等着肖像画洞口打开。这次等在外面的是罗恩，他对胖夫人说了口令（“香蕉炸面团”）。“祝你好运。”罗恩低声说，一边钻进了公共休息室，哈利与他擦身而过。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry moved forward, looking around, his footsteps echoing off the walls. Magnificent though the bathroom was -- and quite keen though he was to try out a few of those taps -- now he was here he couldn't quite suppress the feeling that Cedric might have been having him on. How on earth was this supposed to help solve the mystery of the egg? Nevertheless, he put one of the Huffy towels, the cloak, the map, and the egg at the side of the swimming-pool-sized bath, then knelt down and turned on a few of the taps.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利走上前去，左右张望着，他的脚步声在四壁间回响。这个泛滥间确实豪华漂亮——他也确实渴望试一试其中的几个龙头——但他此刻站在这里，却忍不住感到塞德里克是在捉弄他。这个洗澡间对他解开金蛋的奥秘会有什么帮助呢？他尽管这么想着，还是把一条松软的毛巾、隐形衣、活点地图和金蛋放在游泳池一般大的浴池边，然后跪下去，拧开了几个龙头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His immediate reaction was that it would be worth becoming a prefect just to be able to use this bathroom. It was softly lit by a splendid candle-filled chandelier, and everything was made of white marble, including what looked like an empty, rectangular swimming pool sunk into the middle of the floor. About a hundred golden taps stood all around the pools edges, each with a differently colored Jewel set into its handle. There was also a diving board. Long white linen curtains hung at the windows; a large pile of fluffy white towels sat in a corner, and there was a single golden-framed painting on the wall. It featured a blonde mermaid who was fast asleep on a rock, her long hair over her face. It fluttered every time she snored.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的第一反应是，当一个级长真不赖，单是能够使用这个洗澡间就值了。一个点着蜡烛的豪华枝形吊灯给房间里投下温馨的柔光，每件东西都是用雪白的大理石做成的，包括中间的那个陷入地面的浴池，它就像一个长方形的游泳池。浴池边上大约有一百个金色的龙头，每个龙头的把手上都镶着一块不同颜色的宝石。此外还有一个跳水板。窗户上挂着雪白的亚麻窗帘；一大堆松软的白毛巾放在一个墙角，墙上只挂着一幅画，镶在镀金的镜框里。画上是一个金发的美人鱼，躺在岩石上睡得正香，长长的秀发拂在脸上，随着她的每一次呼吸微微颤抖着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He could tell at once that they carried different sorts of bubble bath mixed with the water, though it wasn't bubble bath as Harry had ever experienced it. One tap gushed pink and blue bubbles the size of footballs; another poured ice-white foam so thick that Harry thought it would have supported his weight if he'd cared to test it; a third sent heavily perfumed purple clouds hovering over the surface of the water. Harry amused himself for awhile turning the taps on and off, particularly enjoying the effect of one whose jet bounced off the surface of the water in large arcs. Then, when the deep pool was full of hot water, foam, and bubbles, which took a very short time considering its size, Harry turned off all the taps, pulled off his pajamas, slippers, and dressing gown, and slid into the water.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他立刻发现，这些龙头喷出的是各种各样混着热水的泡泡浴液，但它们又和哈利以前接触过的泡泡浴完全不同。其中一个龙头喷出足球那么大的粉红色和蓝色的泡泡；另一个喷出晶莹剔透的、又密又厚的泡沫——哈利觉得如果他愿意试一下，这些泡沫准会把他托在水面，沉不下去；第三个龙头喷出香味浓郁的紫色雾气，在水面上弥漫着。哈利玩弄着这些龙头，一会儿开，一会儿关，他特别欣赏一个龙头喷出弧形水柱、从水面划过的奇妙景象。一转眼间，深深的浴池就放满了热水、泡沫和泡泡，这么大的浴池这么快就满了，真是神速。哈利关掉所有的龙头，脱去睡衣、拖鞋和晨衣，钻进了水里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was so deep that his feet barely touched the bottom, and he actually did a couple of lengths before swimming back to the side and treading water, staring at the egg. Highly enjoyable though it was to swim in hot and foamy water with clouds of different-colored steam wafting all around him, no stroke of brilliance came to him, no sudden burst of understanding.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="水真深啊，他的脚勉强够到池底，他在水里游了两个来回，才回到池边，一边踩着水，一边仔细端着金蛋。在热腾腾的、浮着泡沫的水里游泳，周围漂浮着一团团五颜六色的雾气，这滋味真是妙不可言，但是他并没有因此而产生灵感，脑子里也没有灵光一现，豁然开窍。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry stretched out his arms, lifted the egg in his wet hands, and opened it. The wailing, screeching sound filled the bathroom, echoing and reverberating off the marble walls, but it sounded just as incomprehensible as ever, if not more so with all the echoes. He snapped it shut again, worried that the sound would attract Filch, wondering whether that hadn't been Cedric's plan -- and then, making him jump so badly that he dropped the egg, which clattered away across the bathroom floor, someone spoke.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利伸出手臂，用湿漉漉的双手托起金蛋，把它打开。顿时，刺耳的惨叫声充斥了洗澡间，在大理石的墙壁间回响，振荡，但这声音还是那样莫名其妙，而且和所有的回音混在一起，更加令人费解。他啪地一下把它合上，担心这声音会把费尔奇招引过来。他甚至怀疑这就是塞德里克的阴谋——就在这时，突然有人说起话来，吓得他灵魂出窍，金蛋从手里掉落，在洗澡间的地上当啷啷地滚远了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry had swallowed a considerable amount of bubbles in shock. He stood up, sputtering, and saw the ghost of a very glum-looking girl sitting cross-legged on top of one of the taps. It was Moaning Myrtle, who was usually to be heard sobbing in the S-bend of a toilet three floors below.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利一惊之下，吞下了几大口泡泡。他站起来呸呸地吐着，这时才看见一个愁眉苦脸的女鬼跷着二郎腿，坐在一个龙头上面。是哭泣的桃金娘，人们常常听见她在二楼的一个盥洗室的下水管道里伤心哭泣。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This was true, though only because Harry, Ron, and Hermione had found Myrtle's out-of-order toilets a convenient place to brew Polyjuice Potion in secret -- a forbidden potion that had turned him and Ron into living replicas of Crabbe and Goyle for an hour, so that they could sneak into the Slytherin common room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这倒是事实，不过那是因为哈利、罗恩和赫敏发现桃金娘那个失修的厕所非常安全，他们可以在里面偷偷熬制复方汤剂——那是一种禁止使用的魔药，曾把他和罗恩变成了克拉布和高尔的活生生的复制品，持续了一个小时，使他们能够混进斯莱特林的公共休息室。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry walked down the stairs as quietly as possible, though the faces in some of the portraits still turned curiously at the squeak of a floorboard, the rustle of his pajamas. He crept along the corridor below, pushed aside a tapestry about halfway along, and proceeded down a narrower staircase, a shortcut that would take him down two floors.

He lurched forward to try and catch it, but too late; the egg fell down the long staircase with a bang as loud as a bass drum on every step -- the Invisibility Cloak slipped -- Harry snatched at it, and the Marauder's Map fluttered out of his hand and slid down six stairs, where, sunk in the step to above his knee, he couldn't reach it.</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry walked slowly back to Gryffindor Tower, lost in thought about Snape, and Crouch, and what it all meant… Why was Crouch pretending to be ill, if he could manage to get to Hogwarts when he wanted to? What did he think Snape was concealing in his office?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利慢慢地走回格兰芬多塔楼，一路沉思着：斯内普、克劳奇，这一切都意味着什么呢…克劳奇既然能够随心所欲地溜进霍格沃茨，那为什么又要装病呢？他认为斯内普在办公室里藏了什么呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
