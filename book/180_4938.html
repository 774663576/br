<div class="line_en">He had been to Amsterdam, Mr Bankes was saying as he strolled across the lawn with Lily Briscoe. He had seen the Rembrandts. He had been to Madrid. Unfortunately, it was Good Friday and the Prado was shut. He had been to Rome. Had Miss Briscoe never been to Rome? Oh, she should -- It would be a wonderful experience for her -- the Sistine Chapel; Michael Angelo; and Padua, with its Giottos. His wife had been in bad health for many years, so that their sight-seeing had been on a modest scale.</div>

<div class="line_en">She had been to Brussels; she had been to Paris but only for a flying visit to see an aunt who was ill. She had been to Dresden; there were masses of pictures she had not seen; however, Lily Briscoe reflected, perhaps it was better not to see pictures: they only made one hopelessly discontented with one's own work. Mr Bankes thought one could carry that point of view too far. We can't all be Titians and we can't all be Darwins, he said; at the same time he doubted whether you could have your Darwin and your Titian if it weren't for humble people like ourselves. Lily would have liked to pay him a compliment; you're not humble, Mr Bankes, she would have liked to have said. But he did not want compliments (most men do, she thought), and she was a little ashamed of her impulse and said nothing while he remarked that perhaps what he was saying did not apply to pictures. Anyhow, said Lily, tossing off her little insincerity, she would always go on painting, because it interested her. Yes, said Mr Bankes, he was sure she would, and, as they reached the end of the lawn he was asking her whether she had difficulty in finding subjects in London when they turned and saw the Ramsays. So that is marriage, Lily thought, a man and a woman looking at a girl throwing a ball. That is what Mrs Ramsay tried to tell me wearing a green shawl, and they were standing close together watching Prue and Jasper throwing catches. And suddenly the meaning which, for no reason at all, as perhaps they are stepping out of the Tube or ringing a doorbell, descends on people, making them symbolical, making them representative, came upon them, and made them in the dusk standing, looking, the symbols of marriage, husband and wife. Then, after an instant, the symbolical outline which transcended the real figures sank down again, and they became, as they met them, Mr and Mrs Ramsay watching the children throwing catches. But still for a moment, though Mrs Ramsay greeted them with her usual smile (oh, she's thinking we're going to get married, Lily thought) and said, "I have triumphed tonight," meaning that for once Mr Bankes had agreed to dine with them and not run off to his own lodging where his man cooked vegetables properly; still, for one moment, there was a sense of things having been blown apart, of space, of irresponsibility as the ball soared high, and they followed it and lost it and saw the one star and the draped branches. In the failing light they all looked sharp-edged and ethereal and divided by great distances. Then, darting backwards over the vast space (for it seemed as if solidity had vanished altogether), Prue ran full tilt into them and caught the ball brilliantly high up in her left hand, and her mother said, "Haven't they come back yet?" whereupon the spell was broken. Mr Ramsay felt free now to laugh out loud at the thought that Hume had stuck in a bog and an old woman rescued him on condition he said the Lord's Prayer, and chuckling to himself he strolled off to his study. Mrs Ramsay, bringing Prue back into throwing catches again, from which she had escaped, asked,</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她去过布鲁塞尔；她去过出黎，但那只是一次仓促短暂的停留，是去看生病的姑妈的。她去过德累斯顿；有许许多多的画她还没有看到过；不道，莉莉·布里斯柯心里想，也许不看更好：看了只能使你对自己的作品感到不满绝望。班克斯先生认为这种想法可不能过了头。我们不可能人人都成为提香，也不可能人人都成为达尔文，他说；同时他也怀疑，如果没有像我们这样的芸芸众生，会不会有你的达尔义和提香。莉莉很想恭维他几句；你不是芸芸众生，班克斯先生，她很想这样说。但是他不要别人恭维（大多数男人都要的，她想），她对自己的冲动觉得有点不好意思，就没有开口，他却在说也许他刚才的话并不适用于绘画。无论如何，莉莉扔开了刚才不很诚恳的想法，说道，她会继续画下去的，因为她对绘画感兴趣。是的，班克斯先生说，他相信她会的。他们来到了草坪的尽头，他问她在伦敦找绘画的题材有没有困难，这时他们转过身来，看见了拉姆齐夫妇。这么说，这就是婚姻，莉莉心想，一个男人和一个女人看着一个女孩子扔球。这就是那天晚上拉姆齐夫人想给我说的，她想道。拉姆齐夫人围着一条绿披巾，他们紧挨着站在一起看普鲁和贾斯珀扔接球。突然，没有任何原因，他们悟到了其意义，就像人们正走出地铁或按响门铃时会突然感到的那样，使这对夫妇具有了象征性，具有了代表性。使得站在暮色之中观看的他们成了婚姻的象征，丈夫和妻子。然而，瞬间以后，超越了真实形象的象征性外形消失了，重新变成了他们相遇时的看着孩子们扔接球的拉姆齐先生和夫人。但是仍有片刻时间，尽管拉姆齐夫人带着惯常的笑容和他们打招呼（啊，她在想我们要结婚了。莉莉想）并说，“今晚我胜利了。”意思是说这回班克斯先生可算答应和他们一起吃晚饭，而不是跑回自己的住处去，他的佣人蔬菜做得很地道；尽管如此，仍有片刻时间，当球被抛入高空，他们的目光跟着它直到球消失。他们看见了那颗惟一的星星和悬垂的树枝，莉莉产生了一种事物在分崩离析的感觉，一种距离感，一种不可靠感。在越来越浓的暮色中，他们都显得棱角分明，飘渺，相互间隔着很大的距离。这时，普鲁突然从广阔的空间里冲了回来，全速跑到他们身边用左手漂亮地高高地接住了球。她的母亲说道，“他们还没有回来吗？”于是使人入魔的境界被打破了。拉姆齐先生感到又可以毫无顾忌地放声大笑，笑陷在泥沼里的休谟，以及一个要他念完主祷文才肯救他的老太婆；他轻声暗笑着慢慢向书房走去。拉姆齐夫人把从家庭生活的阵线中逃开去玩扔接球的普鲁叫了回来，问她，">查看中文翻译</div>
