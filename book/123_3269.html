<div class="line_en">The Reverend Casy and young Tom stood on the hill and looked down on the Joad place. The small unpainted house was mashed at one corner, and it had been pushed off its foundations so that it slumped at an angle, its blind front windows pointing at a spot of sky well above the horizon. The fences were gone and the cotton grew in the dooryard and up against the house, and the cotton was about the shed barn. The outhouse lay on its side, and the cotton grew close against it. Where the dooryard had been pounded hard by the bare feet of children and by stamping horses' hooves and by the broad wagon wheels, it was cultivated now, and the dark green, dusty cotton grew. Young Tom stared for a long time at the ragged willow beside the dry horse trough, at the concrete base where the pump had been. "Jesus!" he said at last. "Hell musta popped here. There ain't nobody livin' there." At last he moved quickly down the hill, and Casy followed him. He looked into the barn shed, deserted, a little ground straw on the floor, and at the mule stall in the corner. And as he looked in, there was a skittering on the floor and a family of mice faded in under the straw. Joad paused at the entrance to the tool-shed leanto, and no tools were there -- a broken plow point, a mess of hay wire in the corner, an iron wheel from a hayrake and a rat-gnawed mule collar, a flat gallon oil can crusted with dirt and oil, and a pair of torn overalls hanging on a nail. "There ain't nothin' left," said Joad. "We had pretty nice tools. There ain't nothin' left."</div>

<div class="line_en">"We never planted here," Joad said. "We always kept this clear. Why, you can't get a horse in now without he tromps the cotton." They paused at the dry watering trough, and the proper weeds that should grow under a trough were gone and the old thick wood of the trough was dry and cracked. On the well-cap the bolts that had held the pump stuck up, their threads rusty and the nuts gone. Joad looked into the tube of the well and spat and listened. He dropped a clod down the well and listened. "She was a good well," he said. "I can't hear water." He seemed reluctant to go to the house. He dropped clod after clod down the well. "Maybe they're all dead," he said. "But somebody'd a told me. I'd a got word some way."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Le's look in the house. She's all pushed out a shape. Something knocked the hell out of her." They walked slowly toward the sagging house. Two of the supports of the porch roof were pushed out so that the roof flopped down on one end. And the house-corner was crushed in. Through a maze of splintered wood the room at the corner was visible. The front door hung open inward, and a low strong gate across the front door hung outward on leather hinges.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们且到屋里去看看吧。这屋子坍塌得不成样子了。不知是给什么东西捣毁的。”他们慢慢地走向那所倒塌的房子。门廊的撑柱撞倒了两根，屋顶向一头耷拉下来。屋角也撞倒了。从一大堆碎木片看过去，可以看到屋角上的一个房间。前门向里开着，一扇坚实的矮栅门系着皮铰链向外开着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Joad stopped at the step, a twelve-by-twelve timber. "Doorstep's here," he said. "But they're gone -- or Ma's dead." He pointed to the low gate across the front door. "If Ma was anywheres about, that gate'd be shut an' hooked. That's one thing she always done -- seen that gate was shut." His eyes were warm. "Ever since the pig got in over to Jacobs' an' et the baby. Milly Jacobs was jus' out in the barn. She come in while the pig was still eatin' it. Well, Milly Jacobs was in a family way, an' she went ravin'. Never did get over it. Touched ever since. But Ma took a lesson from it. She never lef' that pig gate open 'less she was in the house herself. Never did forget. No -- they're gone -- or dead." He climbed to the split porch and looked into the kitchen. The windows were broken out, and throwing rocks lay on the floor, and the floor and walls sagged steeply away from the door, and the sifted dust was on the boards. Joad pointed to the broken glass and the rocks. "Kids," he said."They'll go twenty miles to bust a window. I done it myself. They know when a house is empty, they know. That's the fust thing kids do when folks move out." The kitchen was empty of furniture, stove gone and the round stovepipe hole in the wall showing light. On the sink shelf lay an old beer opener and a broken fork with its wooden handle gone. Joad slipped cautiously into the room, and the floor groaned under his weight. An old copy of the Philadelphia Ledger was on the floor against the wall, its pages yellow and curling. Joad looked into the bedroom -- no bed, no chairs, nothing. On the wall a picture of an Indian girl in color, labeled Red Wing. A bed slat leaning against the wall, and in one corner a woman's high button shoe, curled up at the toe and broken over the instep. Joad picked it up and looked at it. "I remember this," he said. "This was Ma's. It's all wore out now. Ma liked them shoes. Had 'em for years. No, they've went -- an' took ever'thing."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乔德在一块十二英寸见方的木踏板上站住。“门口的台阶还在，”他说。“可是人都不见了——只怕妈是死了。”他指着前门外边的矮栅门。“如果妈在附近什么地方，这扇栅门就一定会关好扣好。她有一个老习惯——总要把那扇栅门关好才放心。”他的眼睛发酸了。“从前有只猪闯进了雅各布的屋里，吃了他家的小毛娃娃。米莉·雅各布正好到仓棚里去了。她进来的时候，那只猪还在吃呢。哎，米莉·雅各布肚里正怀着孕，她心疼得发疯了。一直没好。从那以后老是疯疯癫癫的。妈却从这件事得到了教训。她自己不在屋里的时候，从不让猪圈的栅门开着。从来不忘记这件事。唉！——他们走了——也许都死了。”他爬上破裂了的门廊，向厨房里望了一望。窗户都砸掉了，外边抛来的石头留在地板上，地板和墙壁都陷下去了，跟屋门成了倾斜的角度，尘沙蒙在木板上。乔德指着破碎的玻璃和石头。“孩子们，”他说，“往往会跑二十英里路去砸人家的窗户。我自己就干过。每逢谁家屋里搬空了，他们都知道。人家搬家的时候，孩子们最喜欢干这一手。”厨房里家具都没有了，炉子也不见了，墙上圆圆的烟囱洞里透着光。污水槽的架子上放着一支开啤酒瓶的旧起子和一把掉了木柄的叉子。乔德小心地溜进屋里，地板在他体重的压力下嘎嘎地直响。一份旧的费城《纪事报》靠墙丢在地板上，每页都已经发黄，卷起了角。乔德向卧室里看了看——没有床，没有椅子，什么都没有了。墙上有一幅彩色的印第安姑娘的画片，标题是《红翼》。一块床板靠在墙边，一个角落里有一只带纽扣的高统女鞋，趾尖跷起，鞋背裂开了。乔德拾起来一看，“这我记得，”他说，“这是妈的鞋。现在全穿破了。妈喜欢这种鞋，穿了许多年。不，他们是搬走了——什么都带走了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The sun had lowered until it came through the angled end windows now, and it flashed on the edges of the broken glass. Joad turned at last and went out and crossed the porch. He sat down on the edge of it and rested his bare feet on the twelve-by-twelve step. The evening light was on the fields, and the cotton plants threw long shadows on the ground, and the molting willow tree threw a long shadow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="太阳现在已经落得很低，射进房屋尽头那些塌了的窗子，照在碎玻璃的边上发出闪光。乔德终于转身走了出来，穿过了门廊。他在门廊边上坐下，把两只光脚踏在那块十二英寸见方的台阶木板上。夕阳的余光照在田野上，棉花秆在地面上投下了很长的影子，那棵凋零的柳树也投下了一道长影。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No. Like I said, they wasn't people to write. Pa could write, but he wouldn'. Didn't like to. It give him the shivers to write. He could work out a catalogue order as good as the nex' fella, but he wouldn' write no letters just for ducks." They sat side by side, staring off into the distance. Joad laid his rolled coat on the porch beside him. His independent hands rolled a cigarette, smoothed it and lighted it, and he inhaled deeply and blew the smoke out through his nose. "Somepin's wrong," he said. "I can't put my finger on her. I got an itch that somepin's wronger'n hell. Just this house pushed aroun' an' my folks gone."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没有。刚才我说过，他们都是不爱写信的人。爸会写信，可就是不肯写。不高兴写。他写起信来就得捏把汗。他能勉强写一封订货清单的信，不比别人差，可是他却不肯随便为了一点小事写信。”他们并排坐在那里，眼睁睁地望着远处。乔德把他那卷着的上衣放在身边的门廊上。他用两只空出来的手卷好一支纸烟，摩平了一下，点上火，深深地吸了一口，使烟从鼻孔里喷出来。“准是出了什么事了，”他说，“我简直莫名其妙。我很担心这里出了天翻地覆的大乱子。只要看看这座房子也撞塌了，家里的人也走掉了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The cat crept close between the men again, and its tail lay flat and its whiskers jerked now and then. The sun dropped low toward the horizon and the dusty air was red and golden. The cat reached out a gray questioning paw and touched Joad's coat. He looked around. "Hell, I forgot the turtle. I ain't gonna pack it all over hell." He unwrapped the land turtle and pushed it under the house. But in a moment it was out, headed southwest as it had been from the first.

The cat lifted a paw and inspected it, flicked its claws out and in again experimentally, and licked its pads with a shell-pink tongue. The red sun touched the horizon and spread out like a jellyfish, and the sky above it seemed much brighter and more alive than it had been. Joad unrolled his new yellow shoes from his coat, and he brushed his dusty feet with his hand before he slipped them on.</div>

"There ain't nothin' so easy to get ready as a rabbit," he said. He lifted the skin of the back, slit it, put his fingers in the hole, and tore the skin off. It slipped off like a stocking, slipped off the body to the neck, and off the legs to the paws. Joad picked up the knife again and cut off head and feet. He laid the skin down, slit the rabbit along the ribs, shook out the intestines onto the skin, and then threw the mess off into the cotton field. And the clean-muscled little body was ready. Joad cut off the legs and cut the meaty back into two pieces. He was picking up the second rabbit when Casy came back with a snarl of bale wire in his hand. "Now build up a fire and put some stakes up," said Joad. "Jesus Christ, I'm hungry for these here creatures!" He cleaned and cut up the rest of the rabbits and strung them on the wire.

<div class="line_en">"He got a gun," said Muley. "He'll use it 'cause he's a deputy. Then he either got to kill you or you got to get his gun away an' kill him. Come on, Tommy. You can easy tell yourself you're foolin' them lyin' out like that. An' it all just amounts to what you tell yourself." The strong lights angled up into the sky now, and the even drone of a motor could be heard. "Come on, Tommy. Don't have to go far, jus' fourteen-fifteen rows over, an' we can watch what they do."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他带着枪呢，”缪利说，“他是警长代理，可以开枪。到那时候，不是他开枪打死你，就是你夺了他的枪来打死他。走吧，汤米。你还是那样躺在外头，捉弄捉弄他们，很容易心满意足。那才真解恨呢。”强烈的亮光现在又向上照射着天空，汽车发动机轰隆轰隆的响声也听得到了。“走吧，汤米。用不着走远，只要走过十四五行就行了，我们可以看看他们怎么办。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Come on, then, over this way." Muley moved around the house and out into the cotton field about fifty yards. "This is good," he said, "Now lay down. You on'y got to pull your head down if they start the spotlight goin'. It's kinda fun." The three men stretched out at full length and propped themselves on their elbows. Muley sprang up and ran toward the house, and in a few moments he came back and threw a bundle of coats and shoes down. "They'd of taken 'em along just to get even," he said. The lights topped the rise and bore down on the house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“来，走这边。”缪利绕过房子，在棉花地里走了五十码左右。“这地方很好，”他说，“快躺下吧。等他们开始拿电筒照过来的时候，你只要把头缩下去就行了。这挺有趣的。”三个人伸直身子躺下来，用胳膊肘支着上身。缪利跳起来，向房子那边跑去，不一会儿他就回来了，把抱来的一堆衣服和鞋子扔在地上。“他们会把这些东西拿去，报复我们，”他说。亮光从山冈上照下来，照到那所房子上了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The car drew up to the house and a spotlight snapped on. "Duck," said Muley. The bar of cold white light swung over their heads and crisscrossed the field. The hiding men could not see any movement, but they heard a car door slam and they heard voices. "Scairt to get in the light," Muley whispered. "Once-twice I've took a shot at the headlights. That keeps Willy careful. He got somebody with 'im tonight." They heard footsteps on wood, and then from inside the house they saw the glow of a flashlight. "Shall I shoot through the house?" Muley whispered. "They couldn't see where it come from. Give 'em somepin to think about."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汽车向房子这边开过来，车灯突然开亮了。“把头钻下去，”缪利说。一道冷森森的白光从他们头上掠过，扫射着田野。躲着的三个人看不见有什么动静，但是他们听见车门砰地响了一声，还有人说话。“当心避开这道光，”缪利轻轻地说，“我扔石头打过一两次车灯。威利这才提防了。今天晚上他还带了一个伴来呢。”他们听到木板上的脚步声，后来就看见房子里照着一道电筒光。“我扔块石头到房子里去好不好？”缪利轻轻地说，“他们不会知道那是从什么地方丢来的。也好给他们一些教训。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A scratching sound came from near the house. "Puttin' out the fire," Muley whispered. "Kickin' dust over it." The car doors slammed, the headlights swung around and faced the road again. "Now duck!" said Muley. They dropped their heads and the spotlight swept over them and crossed and recrossed the cotton field, and then the car started and slipped away and topped the rise and disappeared.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="房子近处传来一阵拨动的声音。“他们把火弄灭了，踢了一些沙土在火上，”缪利轻轻地说。车门砰地响了一声，车灯的光转了方向，又照着那条路了。“快把头埋下去！”缪利说。他们都低下了头，电筒的光扫过他们身上，向棉花地里四处探照了一番，接着汽车就开动起来，上了山冈的顶，消失了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Maybe. You fellas wait here. I know this game." He walked quietly away, and only a slight crunching of clods could be heard from his passage. The two waiting men tried to hear him, but he had gone. In a moment he called from the house. "They didn't leave nobody. Come on back." Casey and Joad struggled up and walked back toward the black bulk of the house. Muley met them near the smoking dust pile which had been their fire. "I didn' think they'd leave nobody," he said proudly. "Me knockin' Willy over an' takin' a shot at the lights once-twice keeps 'em careful. They ain't sure who it is, an' I ain't gonna let 'em catch me. I don't sleep near no house.

<div class="line_cn" title="“这也难说。你们两人在这儿等着吧。我知道这套把戏。”他悄悄地走去，经过的地方只有泥土被踏碎的微微的响声传来。等着的两个人尖着耳朵听他的动静，可是他已经走远了。不一会儿，他从房子里喊道：“没有人。回来吧。”凯西和乔德吃力地爬起来，向那黑黝黝的房子走回去。缪利在那堆还在冒烟的灰烬附近迎接他们。“我没想到他们没留下什么人，”他得意地说，“我揍过威利一顿，还对车灯扔过一两次石头，这就使他们小心了。他们弄不清是谁干的，我可不让他们抓住我。我并不睡在房子附近。如果你们两人愿意跟我去，我可以把睡的地方指给你们看，到了那儿，保险谁也不会在你身上绊倒。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Joad yawned and brought one hand back under his head. They were silent, and gradually the skittering life of the ground, of holes and burrows, of the brush, began again; the gophers moved, and the rabbits crept to green things, the mice scampered over clods, and the winged hunters moved soundlessly overhead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不想睡，”凯西说，“我心里转的念头太多了。”他缩拢两只脚，把双腿交叉起来。他仰起头来，看看晃亮的星星。乔德打了个呵欠，把一只手伸到后面枕着头。他们都默不作声，于是地面、洞穴、草丛里的生物又渐渐开始活跃起来了；土拨鼠爬动着，兔子向有绿叶的东西当中钻过去，耗子在泥土上来回地窜着，猎食的飞虫在头上无声地掠过。">查看中文翻译</div>
