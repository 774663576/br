<div class="line_en">"No. No way!" I shook my head fiercely and then shot a glance at the smug smile on my seventeen-year-old husband's face. "No, this doesn't count. I stopped aging three days ago. I am eighteen forever."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你准备好拆我的礼物了吗？”爱丽丝吟唱着说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I struggled to keep from rolling my eyes. I knew immediately what this key was to -- the "after car." I wondered if I should feel excited. It seemed the vampire conversion hadn't given me any sudden interest in sports cars.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我忍着没给他一个白眼，就知道是这个——那辆“以后的车”。我想我是不是应该表现的兴奋点呢。不过看来变成吸血鬼也没能让我一下子喜欢上运动型车。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Mine first," Alice said, and then stuck her tongue out, foreseeing his answer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“先看我的，”爱丽丝说，目光接着变得呆滞，预判着他的回答。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="爱丽丝绽放出大大的笑容说：“我赢了，非常棒！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My eyebrows pulled together as I wondered how a key could get me into new clothes. Had she gotten me a whole trunkful?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我皱紧了眉头思考着，一把钥匙怎么帮我换上新衣服。不会吧……难道她要送我一卡车的衣服？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Why you don't you just tell me who wins?" Edward said wryly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“为什么你不干脆直接告诉我谁赢了？”爱德华挖苦道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's probably better that I wait for morning, anyway." Edward smiled crookedly at me and then nodded toward Jacob and Seth, who looked like they were crashed for the night; I wonder how long they'd stayed up this time. "I think it might be more fun if Jacob was awake for the big reveal, don't you agree? So that someone there is able to express the right level of enthusiasm?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，可能等到天亮再看更好。”爱德华自我安慰着说，边朝那边点点头。雅各布和塞思，两个人都像疯玩了一个通宵一样，真不知道他们还能清醒几分钟。“我想如果最精彩的时刻雅各布还醒着会好玩多了，不是吗？那样就有人能把最狂热的兴奋表现出来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I grinned back. He knew me well.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我回笑着，他真的了解我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yay," Alice sang. "Bella, give Ness -- Renesmee to Rosalie."</div>

<div class="line_en">Alice shrugged. "In Rose's arms. Or Jacob's. Or Esme's. You get the picture. She has never been set down in her entire life. She's going to be the most spoiled half-vampire in existence."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="罗莎莉说：“她值得这一切，两族的美丽混合。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Rosalie grinned at me, and I was glad to see that the new comradeship between us was still there in her smile. I hadn't been entirely sure it would last after Renesmee's life was no longer tied to mine. But maybe we had fought together on the same side long enough that we would always be friends now. I'd finally made the same choice she would have if she'd been in my shoes. That seemed to have washed away her resentment for all my other choices.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗莎莉对我笑着，我很开心的看到我们之间的友谊并没有消失。我本来还不是很确定它能不能继续，在蕾妮斯梅的生命跟我不再联系的那么紧密之后。不过或许我们一起奋斗了足够长的时间，让我们现在能一直是好朋友。最终，我的选择跟她处在我的境地是会作的一样。这似乎让她忘记了我作的其他的选择。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Is it outside?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“放在外面吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Sort of," Alice said, pushing me forward.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嗯，某种意义上是。”爱丽丝心急的说，推着我往前走。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="即便爱丽丝拽着我的手肘往前冲，我还是不能停止微笑着跟她走进夜色中。只有爱德华跟随我们而来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I realized that lots of things about me -- like truly hating surprises, and not liking gifts in general much more -- had not changed one bit. It was a relief and revelation to discover how much of my essential core traits had come with me into this new body.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我又发现自己一样特性没变了——我还是很讨厌“惊喜”，连礼物都跟着没那么期待了。这让我的压力似乎没那么大了，发现自己还有那么多的内在本质跟着自己来到这个新的身体。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Emmett guffawed. Something about his laugh made me feel like blushing, though I wasn't sure why.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃美特捧腹大笑起来，虽然不知道为什么，但是他笑声中的揶揄让我有点害羞。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Alice took off with us on her heels, heading due north. It was easier to follow the sound of her feet whispering against the ground and the fresh path of her scent than it was to keep my eyes on her through the thick vegetation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱丽丝穿着她的高跟鞋，率领着我们直奔北方而去。跟着她的脚步声和一路留下的新鲜气味而行，要比在浓密的植被中用眼睛锁紧她的身影要简单得多。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It belonged here so absolutely that it seemed as if it must have grown from the rock, a natural formation. Honeysuckle climbed up one wall like a lattice, winding all the way up and over the thick wooden shingles. Late summer roses bloomed in a handkerchief -- sized garden under the dark, deep-set windows. There was a little path of flat stones, amethyst in the night, that led up to the quaint arched wooden door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="它那么自然的坐在那里，属于着这个森林，简直像是从地上长出来的一样。金银花从地上长起来，像画着油画般爬满了整个墙面，一直延伸到房子上方的木瓦下。手帕大小的窗台上盛开着暮夏的玫瑰。奇形怪状的木门前用鹅卵石铺着一条小路，夜色之下，如同紫水晶般闪闪发亮。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"So, after ten years, then?" I was pretty sure that Rosalie and Emmett had nothing on us, but it might sound cocky if I went higher than a decade. "Everybody is normal again? Like they are now?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那么，十年后呢？”我很确定罗莎莉和埃美特的故事跟我们没什么关系，但是如果我们需要比十年更长的时间，我会有点小骄傲的：“所有人都正常了？跟他们现在一样？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He smiled, wrinkling his nose a little. "Rosalie and Emmett were the worst. It took a solid decade before I could stand to be within a five-mile radius of them. Even Carlisle and Esme had a difficult time stomaching it. They kicked the happy couple out eventually. Esme built them a house, too. It was grander than this one, but then, Esme knows what Rose likes, and she knows what you like."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他微笑，皱了下鼻子：“罗莎莉和埃美特是最严重的，花了整整十年我才能出现在他们五里范围内。即使是卡莱尔和埃斯梅也花了很长时间来适应。最后他们还是把这对‘幸福’的夫妻赶了出去。埃斯梅给他们也建了一栋房子，比这栋要显赫得多。但接着，埃斯梅就发现罗莎喜欢什么，她也知道你喜欢什么。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Edward smiled again. "Well, I'm not sure what you mean by normal. You've seen my family going about life in a fairly human way, but you've been sleeping nights." He winked at me. "There's a tremendous amount of time left over when you don't have to sleep. It makes balancing your… interests quite easy. There's a reason why I'm the best musician in the family, why -- besides Carlisle -- I've read the most books, studied the most sciences, become fluent in the most languages… Emmett would have you believe that I'm such a know-it-all because of the mind reading, but the truth is that I've just had a lot of free time."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱德华又笑起来：“嗯，我不知道你说的正常具体是什么意思。你原来已经见过我的家人是怎么过正常的人类日子的，但是你晚上都在睡觉。”他朝我眨了眨眼：“如果你不需要睡觉的话，那你就要挨过一段长的恐怖的无聊时间。它很容易就会改变你的……兴趣。这也是为什么我是家里最好的音乐家，为什么除了卡莱尔，我读了最多的书，学了最多的知识，能流利的讲最多国的语言……埃美特肯定会告诉你，我之所以这么‘无所不知’是因为我心灵感应的能力，但是事实是，我只是有太多空闲时间了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We laughed together, and the motion of our laughter did interesting things to the way our bodies were connected, effectively ending that conversation.</div>
