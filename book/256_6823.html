<div class="line_en">When Mrs. Strickland introduced me to her husband, he gave me a rather indifferent hand to shake. Turning to him gaily, she attempted a small jest.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was only neighbourly to accept.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我不能不帮她这个忙；我接受了她的邀请。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But when at last I met Charles Strickland, it was under circumstances which allowed me to do no more than just make his acquaintance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是最后我同查理斯•思特里克兰德见面，并不是在思特里克兰德太太说的那种情况下。她请我吃饭的那天晚上，除了她丈夫以外，我还结识了另外几个人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Strickland gave the polite little laugh with which people acknowledge a facetiousness in which they see nothing funny, but did not speak.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="思特里克兰德很有礼貌地笑了笑，就象那些承认你说了一个笑话而又不觉得有什么可笑的人一样，他并没有说什么。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's only decent to warn you that you will be bored to extinction. It was a thoroughly dull party from the beginning, but if you will come I shall be uncommonly grateful. And you and I can have a little chat by ourselves."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我要预先声明，你将会厌烦得要命。从一开始我就知道这是一次枯燥乏味的宴客。但是如果你能来的话，我是非常感激的。咱们两个人总还可以谈一谈。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">New arrivals claimed my host's attention, and I was left to myself. When at last we were all assembled, waiting for dinner to be announced, I reflected, while I chatted with the woman I had been asked to "take in," that civilised man practises a strange ingenuity in wasting on tedious exercises the brief span of his life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="又来了别的客人，需要主人去周旋，我被丢在一边。当最后客人都已到齐，只等着宣布开饭的时候，我一边和一位叫我“陪同”的女客随便闲谈，一边思忖：文明社会这样消磨自己的心智，把短促的生命浪费在无聊的应酬上实在令人莫解。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Stricklands "owed" dinners to a number of persons, whom they took no interest in, and so had asked them; these persons had accepted. Why? To avoid the tedium of dining tete-a-tete, to give their servants a rest, because there was no reason to refuse, because they were "owed" a dinner.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="思特里克兰德夫妇在人家吃过饭，“欠下”许多人情，对这些人他们本来是丝毫不感兴趣的。但是他们还是不得不回请这些人，而这些人也都应邀而来了。为什么这样做？是为了避免吃饭时总是夫妻对坐的厌烦，为了让仆人休息半天，还是因为没有理由谢绝，因为该着吃别人一顿饭？谁也说不清。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There were ten people. They met with indifference, and would part with relief. It was, of course, a purely social function.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当天一共有十位宾客。这些人见面时冷冷淡淡，分手时更有一种如释重负的感觉。当然了，这只是完成一次社交义务。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was the kind of party which makes you wonder why the hostess has troubled to bid her guests, and why the guests have troubled to come.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拿这一天的宴会来说，你不能不感到奇怪为什么女主人要请这些客人来，而为什么这些客人也会不嫌麻烦，接受邀请。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The respectability of the party was portentous. The women were too nice to be well dressed, and too sure of their position to be amusing. The men were solid. There was about all of them an air of well-satisfied prosperity.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些客人的身份都非常高贵。女太太们因为知道自己的气派，所以并不太讲究衣着，而且因为知道自己的地位，也不想去讨人高兴。男人们个个雍容华贵。总之，所有这里的人都带着一种殷实富足、踌躇满志的神色。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The dining-room was inconveniently crowded. There was a K. C. and his wife, a Government official and his wife, Mrs. Strickland's sister and her husband, Colonel MacAndrew, and the wife of a Member of Parliament. It was because the Member of Parliament found that he could not leave the House that I had been invited.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="餐厅非常拥挤，让人感到很不舒服。这些人中有一位皇家法律顾问和夫人，一位政府官员和夫人，思特里克兰德太太的姐姐和姐夫麦克安德鲁上校，还有一位议员的妻子。正是因为议员发现自己不能离开议院我才临时被请来补缺。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But there was no general conversation. Each one talked to his neighbour; to his neighbour on the right during the soup, fish, and entree; to his neighbour on the left during the roast, sweet, and savoury. They talked of the political situation and of golf, of their children and the latest play, of the pictures at the Royal Academy, of the weather and their plans for the holidays.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是从来没有大家共同谈一件事的时候，每个人都在同他的邻座谈话，吃汤、鱼和小菜的当儿同右边的人谈，吃烤肉、甜食和开胃小吃的当儿同左边的人谈。他们谈政治形势，谈高尔夫球，谈孩子和新上演的戏，谈皇家艺术学院展出的绘画，谈天气，谈度假的计划。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="她的丈夫举止非常得体。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Perhaps he did not talk very much, and I fancied there was towards the end a look of fatigue in the faces of the women on either side of him.</div>

<div class="line_en">He was a man of forty, not good-looking, and yet not ugly, for his features were rather good; but they were all a little larger than life-size, and the effect was ungainly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他年纪约四十岁，相貌谈不上漂亮，但也不难看，因为他的五官都很端正，只不过都比一般人大了一号，所以显得有些粗笨。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I had nothing to say and so sat silent, trying politely to show interest in the conversation; and because I thought no one was in the least concerned with me, examined Strickland at my ease.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我没有什么事好说，所以只是坐在那里，装作很有礼貌地津津有味地听着别人谈话的样子。因为我知道这些人谁都和我无关，所以就从从容容地仔细打量起思特里克兰德来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was bigger than I expected: I do not know why I had imagined him slender and of insignificant appearance; in point of fact he was broad and heavy, with large hands and feet, and he wore his evening clothes clumsily.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他比我想象中的要高大一些；我不知道为什么我以前会认为他比较纤弱，貌不出众。实际上他生得魁梧壮实，大手大脚，晚礼服穿在身上有些笨拙。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was clean shaven, and his large face looked uncomfortably naked. His hair was reddish, cut very short, and his eyes were small, blue or grey. He looked commonplace.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的胡须刮得很干净，一张大脸光秃秃的让人看着很不舒服。他的头发颜色发红，剪得很短，眼睛比较小，是蓝色或者灰色的。他的相貌很平凡。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He was null. He was probably a worthy member of society, a good husband and father, an honest broker; but there was no reason to waste one's time over him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他是一个毫不引人注意的人。他可能是一个令人起敬的社会成员，一个诚实的经纪人，一个恪尽职责的丈夫和父亲，但是在他身上你没有任何必要浪费时间。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was obvious that he had no social gifts, but these a man can do without; he had no eccentricity even, to take him out of the common run; he was just a good, dull, honest, plain man. One would admire his excellent qualities, but avoid his company.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="显然，他一点儿也没有社交的本领，但这也不一定人人都要有的。他甚至没有什么奇行怪癖，使他免于平凡庸俗之嫌。他只不过是一个忠厚老实、索然无味的普通人。一个人可以钦佩他的为人，却不愿意同他待在一起。">查看中文翻译</div>
