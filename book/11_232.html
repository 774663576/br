<div class="line_en">Suddenly they came out into the open again and found themselves under a pale evening sky pricked by a few early stars. There was a wide treeless space before them, running in a great circle and bending away on either hand. Beyond it was a deep fosse lost in soft shadow, but the grass upon its brink was green, as if it glowed still in memory of the sun that had gone. Upon the further side there rose to a great height a green wall encircling a green hill thronged with mallorn-trees taller than any they had yet seen in all the land. Their height could not be guessed, but they stood up in the twilight like living towers. In their, many-tiered branches and amid their ever-moving leaves countless lights were gleaming, green and gold and silver. Haldir turned towards the Company.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Welcome to Caras Galadhon!" he said. "Here is the city of the Galadhrim where dwell the Lord Celeborn and Galadriel the Lady of Lorien. But we cannot enter here, for the gates do not look northward. We must go round to the southern side, and the way is not short, for the city is great."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“欢迎来到卡拉斯加拉顿！”他说：“这就是树民之城，里面居住着塞勒鹏大人和罗瑞安女皇凯兰崔尔。我们得要从南边绕进去，因为城很大，所以路途并不近。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Haldir knocked and spoke, and the gates opened soundlessly; but of guards Frodo could see no sign. The travellers passed within, and the gates shut behind them. They were in a deep lane between the ends of the wall, and passing quickly through it they entered the City of the Trees. No folk could they see, nor hear any feet upon the paths; but there were many voices, about them, and in the air above. Far away up on the hill they could hear the sound of singing falling from on high like soft rain upon leaves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈尔达敲了敲门，说了几句话，门就无声地敝开了。佛罗多没看见任何关于守卫的迹象。一行人就这么走进城内，大门跟着自动关上。他们走在两座墙之间的道路上，很快地进入了树木之城。他们看不见任何居民，也没听到任何的脚步声，只能听见有许多声音充斥在空气中和飘浮在他们头上。他们可以听见很远的山丘上悦耳的笑语声，如同银铃般地落到树叶上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a road paved with white stone running on the outer brink of the fosse. Along this they went westward, with the city ever climbing up like a green cloud upon their left; and as the night deepened more lights sprang forth, until all the hill seemed afire with stars. They came at last to a white bridge, and crossing found the great gates of the city: they faced south-west, set between the ends of the encircling wall that here overlapped, and they were tall and strong, and hung with many lamps.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这丛林之外，有一条铺满白色石头的小径，他们沿着这条路往西走，看着左边的城市越来越高，如同飘浮在绿云之上一般。随着夜色渐浓，灯光也变得越来越多，最后整个山丘彷佛掩没在星海之中。最后，他们来到一座白色的桥上，对面就是城市的大门，大门面对着西南方，两边则是坚固且悬挂许多灯火的城墙。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They went along many paths and climbed many stairs, until they came to the high places and saw before them amid a wide lawn a fountain shimmering. It was lit by silver lamps that swung from the boughs of trees, and it fell into a basin of silver, from which a white stream spilled. Upon the south side of the lawn there stood the mightiest of all the trees; its great smooth bole gleamed like grey silk, and up it towered, until its first branches, far above, opened their huge limbs under shadowy clouds of leaves. Beside it a broad white ladder stood, and at its foot three Elves were seated. They sprang up as the travellers approached, and Frodo saw that they were tall and clad in grey mail, and from their shoulders hung long white cloaks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们走了许多的路，爬了许多层楼梯，这才来到一块草坪，看见眼前有一个闪闪发光的喷泉。这喷泉被悬挂在附近枝丫上的许多油灯所照亮，落进一个银盆中，银盆中还汨汨地流出一道清澈的泉水。在草坪的南边则是所有的神木中最高大的，它巨大的树干如同灰色的丝绸一样闪烁着光芒，一路往上延伸，直到第一次分岔的枝丫掩没在如同云雾般的树叶之中为止。树干上有一道白色的阶梯，有三名精灵坐在那边，一看见有人靠近，他们立刻跳了起来。佛罗多注意到他们都穿着灰色的锁子甲，披着长长的白色斗篷。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The chamber was filled with a soft light; its walls were green and silver and its roof of gold. Many Elves were seated there. On two chairs beneath the bole of the tree and canopied by a living bough there sat, side by side, Celeborn and Galadriel. They stood up to greet their guests, after the manner of Elves, even those who were accounted mighty kings. Very tall they were, and the Lady no less tall than the Lord; and they were grave and beautiful. They were clad wholly in white; and the hair of the Lady was of deep gold, and the hair of the Lord Celeborn was of silver long and bright; but no sign of age was upon them, unless it were in the depths of their eyes; for these were keen as lances in the starlight, and yet profound, the wells of deep memory.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大厅内充满了柔和的光芒，墙壁是绿色和银色的，屋顶则是黄金色的，许多精灵坐在这里。有两张靠近树干的椅子，上面还有着活生生的树叶作为遮盖，上面坐着塞勒鹏和凯兰崔尔。两人站起来依照精灵的礼仪恭迎客人，用如同接待帝王一般的礼节欢迎远征队的到来。他们非常地高大，女皇并不会比皇帝高出多少；他们都十分严肃，极端美丽。两个人都穿着一身白，女皇的发色是深金色，塞勒鹏的头发则是丰润的亮银色。不过，两人脸上没有任何岁月的痕迹，唯一的线索仅在他们的眼中；两双眼睛都如同月夜中的槍尖一样锐利、闪闪发光，但也都蕴藏着极深的回忆。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As he climbed slowly up Frodo passed many flets: some on one side, some on another, and some set about the bole of the tree, so that the ladder passed through them. At a great height above the ground he came to a wide talan, like the deck of a great ship. On it was built a house, so large that almost it would have served for a hall of Men upon the earth. He entered behind Haldir, and found that he was in a chamber of oval shape, in the midst of which grew the trunk of the great mallorn, now tapering towards its crown, and yet making still a pillar of wide girth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当佛罗多慢慢爬上绳梯的时候，一路上经过许多的了望台，了望台建造的位置都互有不同；有些就环绕着树干建造，绳梯会穿过他们。到距离地面很高的地方时，他来到了一座宽大的了望台，好像一艘巨舰的甲板一样宽大，在上面建了一座屋子，大小竟然大到可以作为地面上人类的大会堂。他跟着哈尔达走了进去，发现自己站在一个椭圆形的大厅中，正中央则是巨大的梅隆树干；虽然都已经快到顶了，但这株树的树干在此看来还是很壮观。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At these words all the Elves in the hall cried aloud in grief and amazement. "These are evil tidings," said Celeborn, "the most evil that have been spoken here in long years full of grievous deeds." He turned to Haldir. "Why has nothing of this been told to me before?" he asked in the Elven-tongue.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Nay, there was no change of counsel," said the Lady Galadriel speaking for the first time. Her voice was clear and musical, but deeper than woman's wont. "Gandalf the Grey set out with the Company, but he did not pass the borders of this land. Now tell us where he is; for I much desired to speak with him again. But I cannot see him from afar, unless he comes within the fences of Lothlorien: a grey mist is about him, and the ways of his feet and of his mind are hidden from me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，爱隆的建议并没有更改，”凯兰崔尔女皇第一次开口了，她的声音如同诗歌般悦耳，但却十分低沉：“灰袍甘道夫和远征队一起出发，但他却没有进入森林的边界，请告诉我们他人在哪里，因为我十分想要和他谈谈。但是，除非他踏进罗斯洛立安的藩篱，否则我是看不到他的。他的四周有团灰色的迷雾，他的脚步和心智都不是我能窥探的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

And if it were possible, one would say that at the last Gandalf fell from wisdom into folly, going needlessly into the net of Moria."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“唉！”塞勒鹏说：“我们早就担心卡拉霍拉斯底下有着邪恶沉睡着。如果我知道矮人再度吵醒了这邪恶，我会阻止你和所有的人进入北方疆界。我这么觉得，甘道夫这次所做的是不必要的牺牲，真是聪明一世，糊涂一时，他不该踏入摩瑞亚的！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"He would be rash indeed that said that thing," said Galadriel gravely. "Needless were none of the deeds of Gandalf in life. Those that followed him knew not his mind and cannot report his full purpose. But however it may be with the guide, the followers are blameless. Do not repent of your welcome to the Dwarf. If our folk had been exiled long and far from Lothlorien, who of the Galadhrim, even Celeborn the Wise, would pass nigh and would not wish to look upon their ancient home, though it had become an abode of dragons?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这么说未免太过武断了，”凯兰崔尔神情凝重地说：“甘道夫这辈子从来不做不必要的事情，跟随他的人不知道他的计划，更无法替他内心所想的辩护。不过，不管他们的向导怎么样，这些人都是无辜的，不要收回你对矮人的贺语。如果我们树之民被长年流放在家园外，即使这里成了恶龙的巢穴，难道你不会想要再度回来这里看看吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Dark is the water of Kheled-zaram, and cold are the springs of Kibil-nala, and fair were the many-pillared halls of Khazad-dum in Elder Days before the fall of mighty kings beneath the stone." She looked upon Gimli, who sat glowering and sad, and she smiled. And the Dwarf, hearing the names given in his own ancient tongue, looked up and met her eyes; and it seemed to him that he looked suddenly into the heart of an enemy and saw there love and understanding. Wonder came into his face, and then he smiled in answer.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Your quest is known to us," said Galadriel, looking at Frodo. "But we will not here speak of it more openly. Yet not in vain will it prove, maybe, that you came to this land seeking aid, as Gandalf himself plainly purposed. For the Lord of the Galadhrim is accounted the wisest of the Elves of Middle-earth, and a giver of gifts beyond the power of kings. He has dwelt in the West since the days of dawn, and I have dwelt with him years uncounted; for ere the fall of Nargothrond or Gondolin I passed over the mountains, and together through ages of the world we have fought the long defeat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们知道你的任务，”凯兰崔尔看着佛罗多：“但我们不会公开讨论它。但或许，你们正如同甘道夫原先计划的一般，前来此地寻求协助，这计划并没有失败。因为树民之皇帝是中土世界中最睿智的精灵，他也有能力赐给你们胜过凡人国王的珍贵礼物。自从天地初开他就居住在西方之境，我和他一起经历了数不尽的年头。在贡多林陷落之后，我就越过了山脉，和他一起并肩抵抗这世界。”">查看中文翻译</div>

And if my designs had not gone amiss, it would have been governed by Gandalf the Grey, and then mayhap things would have gone otherwise. But even now there is hope left. I will not give you counsel, saying do this, or do that. For not in doing or contriving, nor in choosing between this course and another, can I avail; but only in knowing what was and is, and in part also what shall be.

<div class="line_en">That night the Company slept upon the ground, much to the satisfaction of the hobbits. The Elves spread for them a pavilion among the trees near the fountain, and in it they laid soft couches; then speaking words of peace with fair elvish voices they left them. For a little while the travellers talked of their night before in the tree-tops, and of their day's journey, and of the Lord and Lady; for they had not yet the heart to look further back.</div>

<div class="line_en">"There's only stars, as I thought," he said. Then he gave a low gasp, for the stars went out. As if a dark veil had been withdrawn, the Mirror grew grey, and then clear. There was sun shining, and the branches of trees were waving and tossing in the wind. But before Sam could make up his mind what it was that he saw, the light faded; and now he thought he saw Frodo with a pale face lying fast asleep under a great dark cliff. Then he seemed to see himself going along a dim passage, and climbing an endless winding stair. It came to him suddenly that he was looking urgently for something, but what it was he did not know. Like a dream the vision shifted and went back, and he saw the trees again. But this time they were not so close, and he could see what was going on: they were not waving in the wind, they were falling, crashing to the ground.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“果然，正如同我猜测的一样，里面只有星星。”山姆吃了一惊，因为星辰开始消隐。彷佛揭开了一面黑暗的面纱一般，上面的东西渐渐隐匿，变得灰色，随即又变得澄清，里面有着太陽照耀的大地，还有摇曳的树木。在山姆来得及下定决心之前，画面又突然改变了。里面的人物变成了脸色死白，躺在黑暗悬崖上的佛罗多。而他似乎正不停的爬着永无止尽的楼梯。他突然之间发现自己的影像正急着寻找什么东西，但是他一时之间不能够确定自己要找些什么。彷佛如梦一般，他又看到了那些树木；但是这次变得更近，他这才看清楚那些树不是在摇曳，而是被砍倒，跌落在地面。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I will look," said Frodo, and he climbed on the pedestal and bent over the dark water. At once the Mirror cleared and he saw a twilit land. Mountains loomed dark in the distance against a pale sky. A long grey road wound back out of sight. Far away a figure came slowly down the road, faint and small at first, but growing larger and clearer as it approached. Suddenly Frodo realized that it reminded him of Gandalf. He almost called aloud the wizard's name, and then he saw that the figure was clothed not in grey but in white, in a white that shone faintly in the dusk; and in its hand there was a white staff. The head was so bowed that he could see no face, and presently the figure turned aside round a bend in the road and went out of the Mirror's view. Doubt came into Frodo's mind: was this a vision of Gandalf on one of his many lonely journeys long ago, or was it Saruman?</div>

<div class="line_en">Then there was a pause, and after it many swift scenes followed that Frodo in some way knew to be parts of a great history in which he had become involved. The mist cleared and he saw a sight which he had never seen before but knew at once: the Sea. Darkness fell. The sea rose and raged in a great storm. Then he saw against the Sun, sinking blood-red into a wrack of clouds, the black outline of a tall ship with torn sails riding up out of the West. Then a wide river flowing through a populous city. Then a white fortress with seven towers. And then again a ship with black sails, but now it was morning again, and the water rippled with light, and a banner bearing the emblem of a white tree shone in the sun. A smoke as of fire and battle arose, and again the sun went down in a burning red that faded into a grey mist; and into the mist a small ship passed away, twinkling with lights. It vanished, and Frodo sighed and prepared to draw away.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then the Eye began to rove, searching this way and that; and Frodo knew with certainty and horror that among the many things that it sought he himself was one. But he also knew that it could not see him-not yet, not unless he willed it. The Ring that hung upon its chain about his neck grew heavy, heavier than a great stone, and his head was dragged downwards. The Mirror seemed to be growing hot and curls of steam were rising from the water. He was slipping forward.</div>
