<div class="line_en">"Alas! I Fear we cannot stay here longer," said Aragorn. He looked towards the mountains and held up his sword. "Farewell, Gandalf!" he cried. "Did I not say to you: if you pass the doors of Moria, beware? Alas that I spoke true! What hope have we without you?"</div>

<div class="line_en">They rose and looked about them. Northward the dale ran up into a glen of shadows between two great arms of the mountains, above which three white peaks were shining: Celebdil, Fanuidhol, Caradhras. the Mountains of Moria. At the head of the glen a torrent flowed like a white lace over an endless ladder of short falls, and a mist of foam hung in the air about the mountains' feet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们站起身，环顾四周。谷地北方延伸入两座山之间的陰影中，在其上则是三座光辉闪耀的山峰：赛拉布迪尔、法怒德何、卡拉霍拉斯，这些就是构成摩瑞亚外观的三大山峰。在陰影之间的山脚下水气缭绕，如同薄纱包围着一连串如同阶梯般不断上升的瀑布。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">To the east the outflung arm of the mountains marched to a sudden end, and far lands could be descried beyond them, wide and vague. To the south the Misty Mountains receded endlessly as far as sight could reach. Less than a mile away, and a little below them, for they still stood high up on the west side of the dale, there lay a mere. It was long and oval, shaped like a great spear-head thrust deep into the northern glen; but its southern end was beyond the shadows under the sunlit sky. Yet its waters were dark: a deep blue like clear evening sky seen from a lamp-lit room. Its face was still and unruffled. About it lay a smooth sward, shelving down on all sides to its bare unbroken rim.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="往东方看去，山脉的延伸突然间终止了，众人可以看见远方模糊的地形轮廓，在南边则是极目所见绵延不绝的迷雾山脉。不到一哩之外，略低于他们脚底的地方有另一座湖，那是座圆长形的大湖，看起来如同一支刺进北方谷地的槍尖一般。湖水的南半部已经脱离了山脉投射下的陰影，露出在陽光下。但湖水依旧十分幽暗，就像是从通火通明的房间，往外观看万里无云的暮色一样。湖水四周有着美丽的草地，将它包围成一个完整的弧形。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There lies the Mirrormere, deep Kheled-zaram!" said Gimli sadly. "I remember that he said: "May you have joy of the sight! But we cannot linger there." Now long shall I journey ere I have joy again. It is I that must hasten away, and he that must remain."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这就是镜影湖，幽深的卡雷德——萨雷姆！”金雳哀伤地说：“我还记得他告诉我：‘愿你见到它的时候能够获得平安喜乐！但我们没办法在那边耽搁太久的时间。’现在，我想我很久都不会再有平安喜乐了。不能耽搁的是我，他却必须永远留在那个鬼地方。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Company now went down the road from the Gates. It was rough and broken, fading to a winding track between heather and whin that thrust amid the cracking stones. But still it could be seen that once long ago a great paved way had wound upwards from the lowlands of the Dwarf-kingdom. In places there were ruined works of stone beside the path, and mounds of green topped with slender birches, or fir-trees sighing in the wind. An eastward bend led them hard by the sward of Mirrormere, and there not far from the roadside stood a single column broken at the top.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="众人沿着大门外的小径继续往下走。小径十分狭窄，又因为年久失修而支离破碎，许多地方都掩没在杂草中。不过，依旧看得出来这里曾经是通往矮人王国的一条主要干道。在道路旁的许多地方还有岩石雕刻的作品，以及翠绿的桦树和迎风飘逸的枞树。一个往东的大转弯，让他们来到了镜影湖旁边的草地上，离小径不远的地方，矗立着一个顶端断裂的石柱。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Beside the standing stone Gimli halted and looked up. It was cracked and weather-worn, and the faint runes upon its side could not be read. "This pillar marks the spot where Durin first looked in the Mirrormere," said the dwarf. "Let us look ourselves once, ere we go!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在那块都灵之础石旁，金雳停了下来，抬头看着。石柱历经风吹雨打，上面的符文也已经无法阅读。“这根石柱，是纪念是都灵第一次在这里俯瞰镜影湖。”矮人说：“在我们离开之前，绝对不可以错过这景象！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Come with me, Frodo!" cried the dwarf, springing from the road. "I would not have you go without seeing Kheled-zaram." He ran down the long green slope. Frodo followed slowly, drawn by the still blue water in spite of hurt and weariness; Sam came up behind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“跟我来吧，佛罗多！”矮人大喊着离开小径：“我可不能让你离开前没看过卡雷德——萨雷姆。”他沿着绿色的长坡往下跑，即使佛罗多又累又难过，他还是被那蓝色的湖水所深深吸引，山姆跟在他后面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Be swift then!" said Aragorn, looking back towards the Gates. "The Sun sinks early. The Orcs will not, maybe, come out till after dusk, but we must be far away before nightfall. The Moon is almost spent, and it will be dark tonight."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那就快一点吧！”阿拉贡回头看着摩瑞亚的大门：“太陽西沉得很快，或许在天黑之前那些半兽人不会出现，但我们一定得在日落前远离这个地方。今晚应该会是新月，大地会很黑暗的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They stooped over the dark water. At first they could see nothing. Then slowly they saw the forms of the encircling mountains mirrored in a profound blue, and the peaks were like plumes of white flame above them; beyond there was a space of sky. There like jewels sunk in the deep shone glinting stars, though sunlight was in the sky above. Of their own stooping forms no shadow could be seen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们弯腰看着黑色的湖水，一开始什么都看不到，接着慢慢地，他们看见了倒影在蓝色镜面中壮丽的群山，山峰如同顶端套上白色火焰一样雄伟，除此之外还有一大块蓝色的天空。即使天空中太陽依旧炙热，他们还是可以看见幽深的湖水中有着星辰闪烁，从他们低头的身影中看不见任何的陰影。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The road now turned south and went quickly downwards, running out from between the arms of the dale. Some way below the mere they came on a deep well of water, clear as crystal, from which a freshet fell over a stone lip and ran glistening and gurgling down a steep rocky channel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这条路现在转向南，开始急速地下降，穿过了山谷两边合拢的臂弯。在距离镜影湖不远的地方，他们又找到了一池如同水晶一样清澈的清水，它们从池水的边缘一滴滴流下，落入一条深邃多岩的河道上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What did you see?" said Pippin to Sam, but Sam was too deep in thought to answer.</div>

<div class="line_en">"O Kheled-zaram fair and wonderful!" said Gimli. "There lies the Crown of Durin till he wakes. Farewell!" He bowed, and turned away, and hastened back up the green-sward to the road again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“喔，美丽壮观的卡雷德——萨雷姆！”金雳说。“里面沉眠着都灵的皇冠，直到他苏醒为止。再会了！”他鞠躬为礼，接着急忙跑上山坡，再度回到路上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Soon it becomes a swift river, and it gathers water from many other mountain-streams," said Aragorn. "Our road leads beside it for many miles. For I shall take you by the road that Gandalf chose, and first I hope to come to the woods where the Silverlode flows into the Great River-out yonder." They looked as he pointed, and before them they could see the stream leaping down to the trough of the valley, and then running on and away into the lower lands, until it was lost in a golden haze.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“很快的，它就会变成一条湍急的河流，汇聚许多其他的山泉，”阿拉贡说：“我们的道路和它的路径有很长一段距离是相合的。因为我必须遵照甘道夫的遗志，率领各位沿着银光河往森林前进，前往它和大河安都因汇流的地方。”众人看着他指的方向，注意到小溪跳跃进山谷中，一路流向泛着金光的遥远彼端。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"There lie the woods of Lothlorien!" said Legolas. "That is the fairest of all the dwellings of my people. There are no trees like the trees of that land. For in the autumn their leaves fall not, but turn to gold. Not till the spring comes and the new green opens do they fall, and then the boughs are laden with yellow flowers; and the floor of the wood is golden, and golden is the roof, and its pillars are of silver, for the bark of the trees is smooth and grey. So still our songs in Mirkwood say. My heart would be glad if I were beneath the eaves of that wood, and it were springtime! "</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那里就是罗斯洛立安森林！”勒苟拉斯惊叹道：“那是我族同胞所居住的最美丽地方，没有其他地方的树木能够生长得如同这里一样。即使是到了秋天，树叶也只是转成金黄，并不落下。只有到了春天新叶长出时，这些老叶才会落下，让枝丫上挂满黄花，森林的地面一片金黄；由于树干都是灰白色的，到了那时会构成一片金顶银柱的绝顶壮丽景象。我们幽暗密林的歌谣中依旧赞颂着这个地方，如果我们能够在春天站在那些树下，我的心必定会雀跃不已！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For some time Frodo and Sam managed to keep up with the others; but Aragorn was leading them at a great pace, and after a while they lagged behind. They had eaten nothing since the early morning. Sam's cut was burning like fire, and his head felt light. In spite of the shining sun the wind seemed chill after the warm darkness of Moria. He shivered. Frodo felt every step more painful and he gasped for breath.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="刚开始，佛罗多和山姆还勉强可以跟上众人，但阿拉贡的步伐越来越快，不久之后他们就开始脱队。自从今天早上以后，他们就什么东西都没吃。山姆的割伤如同火烧一样热辣辣地疼痛，他觉得头重脚轻。即使天空高挂着太陽，但在经历过摩瑞亚的闷热之后，这里的空气似乎还是冷冰冰的，他忍不住打了个寒颤。佛罗多则是觉得每一步都很勉强，必须经常大口吸气才能跟上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I am sorry, Frodo!" he cried, full of concern. "So much has happened this day and we have such need of haste, that I have forgotten that you were hurt; and Sam too. You should have spoken. We have done nothing to ease you, as we ought, though all the orcs of Moria were after us. Come now! A little further on there is a place where we can rest for a little. There I will do what I can for you. Come, Boromir! We will carry them."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对不起，佛罗多，”他满怀关切地说：“今天发生了好多事情，我们又急着赶路，我根本忘记你和山姆都受伤了。即使摩瑞亚所有的半兽人都在后面追赶，我们也不该忘记这件事情。来吧！前面有块我们可以暂时休息的地方，我会在那边尽力帮助你的。来吧，波罗莫，我们抱他们走。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Soon afterwards they came upon another stream that ran down from the west, and joined its bubbling water with the hurrying Silverlode. Together they plunged over a fall of green-hued stone, and foamed down into a dell. About it stood fir-trees, short and bent, and its sides were steep and clothed with harts-tongue and shrubs of whortle-berry. At the bottom there was a level space through which the stream flowed noisily over shining pebbles. Here they rested. It was now nearly three hours after noon, and they had come only a few miles from the Gates. Already the sun was westering.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="很快地，他们又遇上了另外一条从西边而来，和奔流的银光河会合的小溪。它们沿着一道泛着绿光的瀑布往下流，流进一座小山谷。山谷之中有许多弯曲、低矮的枞树，小河两旁陡峭的山壁上长满了野生的莓子和许多苔藓。在河谷底则有一块平坦的区域，小河从旁边喧闹地流过，众人就在那一区停下脚步休息。现在大概是下午三点，他们只不过远离摩瑞亚的大门几哩左右，太陽也已经开始西沉了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Good luck, Sam!" he said. "Many have received worse than this in payment for the slaying of their first orc. The cut is not poisoned, as the wounds of orc-blades too often are. It should heal well when I have tended it. Bathe it when Gimli has heated water."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“山姆，你运气真不错！”他说：“许多人为了斩杀手下的第一名半兽人，受到了比你严重很多倍的伤。幸好对方的刀剑没有像一般半兽人一样淬毒。在我处理过之后，它应该可以很轻易地愈合。等金雳把水热开之后，你先用热水冲冲伤口。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He opened his pouch and drew out some withered leaves. "They are dry and some of their virtue has one, he said, but here I have still some of the leaves of athelas that I gathered near Weathertop. Crush one in the water, and wash the wound clean, and I will bind it. Now it is your turn. Frodo! "</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他打开背包，掏出一些干枯的叶子：“这些已经干掉了，一部分的药效也变得比较弱。”他说：“但是我身上还带着这些在风云顶附近找到的阿夕拉斯。把一片撕碎丢在水中，将伤口洗净，我就可以把它包扎起来。佛罗多，现在轮到你了！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No!" said Aragorn. "We must have a look and see what the hammer and the anvil have done to you. I still marvel that you are alive at all." Gently he stripped off Frodo's old jacket and worn tunic, and gave a gasp of wonder. Then he laughed. The silver corslet shimmered before his eyes like the light upon a rippling sea. Carefully he took it off and held it up, and the gems on it glittered like stars. and the sound of the shaken rings was like the tinkle of rain in a pool.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不行！”阿拉贡坚持道：“我们一定得看看你之前所说的铁锤和铁砧，对你造成了什么伤害。我还是很惊讶你竟然可以活下来。”他小心翼翼地脱下佛罗多的旧夹克和破衬衫，接着倒抽一口冷气，然后他笑了，那银色的背心如同银色的海浪一般在他眼中波动。他小心地脱下那件背心，将缀满如星辰般白色宝石的锁子甲高举，只要一晃动，就可以听见如同骤雨落入池水般的清脆金属撞击声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">While Gimli and the two younger hobbits kindled a fire of brush -- and fir-wood, and drew water, Aragorn tended Sam and Frodo. Sam's wound was not deep, but it looked ugly, and Aragorn's face was grave as he examined it. After a moment he looked up with relief.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a dark and blackened bruise on Frodo's right side and breast. Under the mail there was a shirt of soft leather, but at one point the rings had been driven through it into the flesh. Frodo's left side also was scored and bruised where he had been hurled against the wall. While the others set the food ready. Aragorn bathed the hurts with water in which athelas was steeped. The pungent fragrance filled the dell, and all those who stooped over the steaming water felt refreshed and strengthened. Soon Frodo felt the pain leave him, and his breath grew easy: though he was stiff and sore to the touch for many days. Aragorn bound some soft pads of cloth at his side.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佛罗多的腰际和右胸全都是黑紫色的淤青。在锁子甲底下有垫着一层软皮甲，不过，有个地方锁子甲还是承受不住这怪力，因而咬进肉里。佛罗多的左边身体因为撞上洞壁，也全都是擦伤和淤青。在其他人处理午餐的时候，阿拉贡用泡过阿夕拉斯的热水浸洗两人的伤口。一股让人神清气爽的香气飘满了整个河谷，围拢在沸水旁边的人们都觉得焕然一新、精力充沛。很快地，佛罗多觉得伤口不再疼痛，也不需要那么用力呼吸了；不过，被撞伤的地方接下来好几天，还是会很僵硬和酸痛，阿拉贡又在他的两侧腰际多绑了些软布。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Not a sound but the wind," he said. "There are no goblins near, or my ears are made of wood. It is to be hoped that the Orcs will be content with driving us from Moria. And maybe that was all their purpose, and they had nothing else to do with us-with the Ring. Though Orcs will often pursue foes for many leagues into the plain, if they have a fallen captain to avenge."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“除了风声之外什么都没有，”他说：“除非我的耳朵是木头做的，我想附近应该根本没有任何敌人。希望半兽人把我们赶出摩瑞亚就满足了。或许，这一直都是他们的目的，和我们的魔戒没有关系。不过，如果半兽人是为了酋长复仇，他们会在平原上追杀敌人好几十哩之遥。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Frodo did not answer. He looked at Sting, and the blade was dull. Yet he had heard something, or thought he had. As soon as the shadows had fallen about them and the road behind was dim, he had heard again the quick patter of feet. Even now he heard it. He turned swiftly. There were two tiny gleams of light behind, or for a moment he thought he saw them, but at once they slipped aside and vanished.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佛罗多没有回答。他看着刺针，宝剑黯沉无光，但他觉得自己彷佛听到了某些声响。随着陰影落下，身后陷入一片黑暗，他又再度听见了赤脚快速奔跑的声音。即使是在两人说话的时候，他还是听得见这声音。他猛地转过头，他觉得自己似乎看见了两个微小的光源，但很快就消失了。">查看中文翻译</div>

But lore wanes in Gondor, Boromir, if in the city of those who once were wise they now speak evil of Lothlorien.

<div class="line_cn" title="“他们的确居住在很远的地方。”阿拉贡说道，他叹了口气，彷佛记起什么美丽的回忆：“我们今晚必须要照顾好自己才行，。我们必须继续往森林走一段距离，直到树木都将我们包围为止。然后我们会离开小径，找寻一个可以过夜的安全地方。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One by one they climbed down and followed Legolas. For a moment Frodo stood near the brink and let the water flow over his tired feet.

<div class="line_en">"I will climb up," said Legolas. "I am at home among trees, by root or bough, though these trees are of a kind strange to me, save as a name in song. Mellyrn they are called, and are those that bear the yellow blossom, but I have never climbed in one. I will see now what is their shape and way of growth."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“由我来爬上去，”勒苟拉斯说：“不管是树下或是树上，都是我的老家。虽然这些树木对我有些陌生，只出现在歌谣的记载中。他们叫作梅隆树，意思是说它们会结黄花。但我从来没爬过这类树木，让我先看看它们的形状和生长的方向。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Then dig a hole in the ground," said Legolas, "if that is more after the fashion of your kind. But you must dig swift and deep, if you wish to hide from Orcs."

<div class="line_en">There was a sound of soft laughter over their heads, and then another clear voice spoke in an elven-tongue. Frodo could understand little of what was said, for the speech that the Silvan folk east of the mountains used among themselves was unlike that of the West. Legolas looked up and answered in the same language.*</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们头上的树顶传来轻笑声，以及另外一个操精灵口音的声音。佛罗多听不太懂对方在说些什么，因为迷雾山脉东边的森林精灵和西边的精灵所使用的语言并不相同。勒苟拉斯抬起头，用同样的语言回答。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes, they are Elves," said Legolas; "and they say that you breathe so loud that they could shoot you in the dark." Sam hastily put his hand over his mouth. "But they say also that you need have no fear. They have been aware of us for a long while. They heard my voice across the Nimrodel, and knew that I was one of their Northern kindred, and therefore they did not hinder our crossing; and afterwards they heard my song. Now they bid me climb up with Frodo; for they seem to have had some tidings of him and of our journey. The others they ask to wait a little and to keep watch at the foot of the tree, until they have decided what is to be done."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没错，他们是精灵，”勒苟拉斯说：“他们还说你们的呼吸声大到让他们可以在黑暗中瞄准你们。”山姆急忙用手捂住嘴巴。“但他们也说你们不需要害怕，他们已经发现我们很长的一段时间了。他们在宁若戴尔的对岸就听见我的声音，知道我是他们北方的同胞，因此他们没有阻挡我们过河；在那之后他又听到了我的歌声。现在，他们要求我和佛罗多一起爬上去，因为他们似乎有些关于他和我们冒险相关的消息。他要求其他人在树底下暂时等一下，等他们决定到底该怎么做。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When Frodo came at last up on to the flet he found Legolas seated with three other Elves. They were clad in shadowy-grey, and could not be seen among the tree-stems, unless they moved suddenly. They stood up, and one of them uncovered a small lamp that gave out a slender silver beam. He held it up, looking at Frodo's face, and Sam's. Then he shut off the light again, and spoke words of welcome in his elven-tongue. Frodo spoke haltingly in return.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当佛罗多最后终于上到了望台时，他发现勒苟拉斯和另外三名精灵坐在一起。这些精灵都穿着暗灰色的衣服，除非他们突然行动，否则在树木的陰影中是完全没办法发现他们的。他们站了起来，其中一人拿出一盏发出银光的油灯。他举着油灯，照着山姆和佛罗多的脸。然后他把油灯的机关关上，用精灵语欢迎他们的到来，佛罗多有些迟疑地回应他们。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Out of the shadows a ladder was let down: it was made of rope, silver-grey and glimmering in the dark, and though it looked slender it proved strong enough to bear many men. Legolas ran lightly up, and Frodo followed slowly; behind came Sam trying not to breathe loudly. The branches of the mallorn-tree grew out nearly straight from the trunk, and then swept upward; but near the top the main stem divided into a crown of many boughs, and among these they found that there had been built a wooden platform, or flet as such things were called in those days: the Elves called it a talan. It was reached by a round hole in the centre through which the ladder passed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从陰影中降下一条绳梯，那是由一种银灰色，在黑暗中闪闪发光的材料所做的。虽然它看起来很纤细，但却可以承受好几个人的体重。勒苟拉斯飞快地爬上去，佛罗多则是小心翼翼地跟在后面。山姆是屏住呼吸，十分谨慎地跟着。梅隆树的枝丫几乎和树木本身垂直，因此他们上去的时候必须小心不被枝丫撞到。不过，到了顶端，枝干分岔开来，构成了一个许多分枝的平坦区域，在这一块区域上他们又看到有人造了一块木制的平台，过去被叫作了望台，精灵们则是称呼它为塔兰。他们透过平台中央的的一个孔穴出入，绳梯就是从这边垂下来的。">查看中文翻译</div>

Hobbits do not like heights, and do not sleep upstairs, even when they have any stairs. The flet was not at all to their liking as a bedroom.

He was thankful that they had not been caught on the ground; but he felt that the trees offered little protection, except concealment. Orcs were as keen as hounds on a scent, it was said, but they could also climb. He drew out Sting: it flashed and glittered like a blue flame and then slowly faded again and grew dull. In spite of the fading of his sword the feeling of immediate danger did not leave Frodo, rather it grew stronger. He got up and crawled to the opening and peered down. He was almost certain that he could hear stealthy movements at the tree's foot far below.</div>

High amid the branches of a towering tree that stood in the centre of all there gleamed a white flet. At the feet of the trees, and all about the green hillsides the grass was studded with small golden flowers shaped like stars.

It seemed to him that he had stepped through a high window that looked on a vanished world. A light was upon it for which his language had no name. All that he saw was shapely, but the shapes seemed at once clear cut, as if they had been first conceived and drawn at the uncovering of his eyes, and ancient as if they had endured for ever. He saw no colour but those he knew, gold and white and blue and green, but they were fresh and poignant, as if he had at that moment first perceived them and made for them names new and wonderful. In winter here no heart could mourn for summer or for spring. No blemish or sickness or deformity could be seen in anything that grew upon the earth. On the land of Lorien there was no stain.</div>

<div class="line_en">He turned and saw that Sam was now standing beside him, looking round with a puzzled expression, and rubbing his eyes as if he was not sure that he was awake. "It's sunlight and bright day, right enough," he said. "I thought that Elves were all for moon and stars: but this is more elvish than anything I ever heard tell of. I feel as if I was inside a song. if you take my meaning."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他转过身，看见山姆站在他身边，脸上挂着疑惑的表情，不停地揉着眼睛，彷佛想要确定这是否是真的。“这的确是在陽光下，”他说：“我本来以为精灵都是在月亮和星光下的，但这比我所曾听过的都还要更为精灵化。我觉得自己彷佛身处在歌谣中，如果您能够了解我的意思。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They followed him as he stepped lightly up the grass-clad slopes. Though he walked and breathed, and about him living leaves and flowers were stirred by the same cool wind as fanned his face, Frodo felt that he was in a timeless land that did not fade or change or fall into forgetfulness. When he had gone and passed again into the outer world, still Frodo the wanderer from the Shire would walk there, upon the grass among elanor and niphredil in fair Lothlorien.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们跟着他一起踏上绿草遍布的小丘。佛罗多觉得自己的一呼一吸和所有的行动，都被包围在一种同样不受时间影响的空气中，让人永远不能忘怀这如梦一般的处境；即使后来当他离开了这里，他还是会常在梦中回到这个地方，观看着这个长满了伊拉诺和宁芙瑞迪尔的罗斯洛立安。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They entered the circle of white trees. As they did so the South Wind blew upon Cerin Amroth and sighed among the branches. Frodo stood still, hearing far off_ great seas upon beaches that had long ago been washed away, and sea-birds crying whose race had perished from the earth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们踏入了白树的内围，此时南风吹进白树间，发出悠远的叹息声，佛罗多感觉自己听到了远方海洋的浪潮声，以及早已绝种的海鸟鸣叫声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Haldir had gone on and was now climbing to the high flet. As Frodo prepared to follow him, he laid his hand upon the tree beside the ladder: never before had he been so suddenly and so keenly aware of the feel and texture of a tree's skin and of the life within it. He felt a delight in wood and the touch of it, neither as forester nor as carpenter; it was the delight of the living tree itself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈尔达现在已经爬上了了望台，佛罗多准备紧跟其后，当他刚把手放到梯旁树上时，突然间无比清晰地感受到树木生命力，和它细致的纹理。他觉得自己很高兴能够摸到这株森林中的树，这和伐木工人和木匠的感受不一样，他是为了这株活生生的树而高兴。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Haldir looked at them, and he seemed indeed to take the meaning of both thought and word. He smiled. "You feel the power of the Lady of the Galadhrim," he said. "Would it please you to climb with me up Cerin Amroth? "</div>

<div class="line_en">"There lies the fastness of Southern Mirkwood," said Haldir. "It is clad in a forest of dark fir, where the trees strive one against another and their branches rot and wither. In the midst upon a stony height stands Dol Guldur, where long the hidden Enemy had his dwelling. We fear that now it is inhabited again, and with power sevenfold. A black cloud lies often over it of late. In this high place you may see the two powers that are opposed one to another; and ever they strive now in thought, but whereas the light perceives the very heart of the darkness, its own secret has not been discovered. Not yet." He turned and climbed swiftly down, and they followed him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那就是幽暗密林南方的边境，”哈尔达说：“它是个长满了黑暗枞树的地方，那里一株接一株枞树紧接着生长，也一起腐烂、枯萎。在其中的一块岩石高地上是加尔哥多，也就是魔王许多以前蛰伏的地方。我们担心邪恶势力可能再度滋长，而且其力量不只增加了七八倍。进来它的上空经常飘浮着黑色的云朵。在这里，你们可以看见光明与黑暗彼此争斗的过程，但即使光明感应到了黑暗的内心，它自己真正的秘密尚未被揭露，时候还没到。”他转身，快速地爬下绳梯，其他人紧跟在后。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Frodo looked and saw, still at some distance, a hill of many mighty trees, or a city of green towers: which it was he could not tell. Out of it, it seemed to him that the power and light came that held all the land in sway. He longed suddenly to fly like a bird to rest in the green city. Then he looked eastward and saw all the land of Lorien running down to the pale gleam of Anduin, the Great River. He lifted his eyes across the river and all the light went out, and he was back again in the world he knew. Beyond the river the land appeared flat and empty, formless and vague, until far away it rose again like a wall, dark and drear. The sun that lay on Lothlorien had no power to enlighten the shadow of that distant height.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佛罗多看见一段距离之外，有一座长有许多高大树木的山丘，或者那是一个拥有绿色高塔的城市？他看不出来，他只能够感受到似乎一切守护此地的光明和力量，都是从其中溢流而出。他突然间想要长出翅膀，赶快飞到那个绿色的城市中休息。然后，他看向东方，看见罗瑞安的领土一路延伸到安都因大河的河光之下。他将目光移过大河，却发现所有的光芒都消失了。在河的另外一边，大地看来十分的平坦、空旷，没有任何的特征；但更远处，它却像是一个深井一样升起，流露出黝黑的外表，照耀在罗斯洛立安上的陽光无力照亮该处。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Here is the heart of Elvendom on earth," he said, "and here my heart dwells ever, unless there be a light beyond the dark roads that we still must tread, you and I. Come with me!" And taking Frodo's hand in his, he left the hill of Cerin Amroth and came there never again as living man.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这是世界上精灵国度的正中心，”他说：“我的心永远停驻在此地。除非，你我的黑暗的旅程之后还有光明，否则恐怕是没有机会再看到此景。跟我来吧！”他牵着佛罗多的手，离开瑟林—安罗斯的山丘，从此再也没有活着回来过。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At the hill's foot Frodo found Aragorn, standing still and silent as a tree; but in his hand was a small golden bloom of elanor, and a light was in his eyes. He was wrapped in some fair memory: and as Frodo looked at him he knew that he beheld things as they once had been in this same place. For the grim years were removed from the face of Aragorn, and he seemed clothed in white, a young lord tall and fair; and he spoke words in the Elvish tongue to one whom Frodo could not see. Arwen vanimelda, namarie! he said, and then he drew a breath, and returning out of his thought he looked at Frodo and smiled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在土丘底下，佛罗多看见阿拉贡楞楞地站在那里，如同树木一样沉默；但他手中拿着一朵小小的金色伊拉诺，眼中闪烁着光芒，他似乎陷入了美丽的回忆中。佛罗多看着他脸上露出迷蒙的表情，那神行客才有的浪迹天涯之沧桑，都在这美丽的环境中被抚平；他似乎穿着白袍，恢复成一名高大英挺的王者，他似乎对一名佛罗多看不见的人说着精灵语。Arwen vanimelda， namarie！呢喃着，然后深吸一口气，突然间回到现实世界，看着眼前的佛罗多，露出微笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
