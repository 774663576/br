<div class="line_en">All this time Bathsheba was aware of his eyes on her. At last she had made him look at her! But she would have preferred him to admire her from the beginning, without the encouragement of her valentine. She felt sorry she had disturbed the usual calmness of a man she respected, but considered she could not apologize to him without either offending or encouraging him.</div>

<div class="line_en">On Saturday at Casterbridge market Boldwood saw the woman who was disturbing his dreams. For the first time he turned his head and looked at her. It was in fact the first time in his life that he had looked at any woman. Up to now he had considered women to be distant, almost foreign creatures who had nothing to do with him. Now he saw Bathsheba's hair, and every detail of her face. He noticed her figure, her dress, and even her feet. She seemed very beautiful to him, and his heart began to move within him. "And this woman, this lovely young woman, has asked me to marry her!" he thought. As he was watching Bathsheba selling wheat to another farmer, he was filled with jealousy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="星期六，在卡斯特桥的集市上，伯德伍德看到了那个搅乱了他的梦的女人。第一次他扭过头来看她。实际上，这是他有生以来头一次盯着看女人。到目前为止，他一直都把女人当作是遥远的，甚至是陌生的、与他无关的生物。现在，他看到了芭丝谢芭的头发，看到了她脸上的每一处。他注意到了她的身材、她的穿着，甚至她的脚。在他看来她似乎是很美的，他的心开始跳动。“这个女人，这个漂亮、年轻的女人要我和他结婚！”他心想。当他看到芭丝谢芭把麦子卖给另一个农场主时，内心充满嫉妒。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As he stopped at the gate of the field, Bathsheba looked up and noticed him. Gabriel was watching her face and saw her blush. He immediately thought of the envelope, with the valentine, that Boldwood had shown him, and suspected Bathsheba of encouraging the farmer to fall in love with her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他在田地的大门口停住了脚，这时芭丝谢芭抬起头来，注意到了她。盖伯瑞尔看着她，发现她红了脸。他立刻想到伯德伍德给他看的那个装着情人卡的信封，估计是芭丝谢芭引得这位农场主爱上了她。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mr Boldwood did not try to speak to her, and returned home to his farm. He was a man of strong feelings, which normally lay hidden deep inside him. Because he was serious, and did not joke with his neighbours, people thought he was cold But when he loved or hated, it was with his whole heart. If Bathsheba had known how strong the feelings of this dark and silent figure were, she would have blamed herself terribly for her thoughtlessness. But nobody guessed what lay behind his calm appearance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伯德伍德先生没有和她说话，他回到了农场的家里。他是一个感情强烈的人，他的情感通常都深深地埋在心底。他严肃，不和邻居们开玩笑，所以人们都觉得他很冷漠。可他爱谁或是恨谁时，却是全心全意的。如果芭丝谢芭知道这个黝黑、沉静的人的感情是多么强烈的话，她一定会为自己的不慎重而自责不已。不过，谁也不知道在他沉静的外表后面藏着什么。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A few days later Mr Boldwood was looking at Bathsheba's fields, which were next to his own, when he saw her helping Gabriel Oak with the sheep. To Boldwood, Bathsheba shone like the moon on a dark night. His heart, which had never been touched before, was filled completely with his love for her. He decided to go and speak to her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几天后，伯德伍德先生望着与他的地挨着的芭丝谢芭的田地，他看见她在帮着盖伯瑞尔·奥克照料羊群。伯德伍德觉得芭丝谢芭象黑夜的月亮发着光。他的那颗从不为什么所动的心充满了对她的爱意。他决定去对她表明心声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Bathsheba, however, knew that he had come to see her, and felt extremely guilty. She promised herself never again to disturb the peace of this man's life. Unfortunately her promise was made too late, as such promises often are.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was not until the end of May that Boldwood was brave enough to declare his love. He went to Bathsheba's house, where the maids told him their mistress was watching the sheep-washing. Every spring the sheep were washed in a special pool, to keep their wool clean and to get rid of insects on their skin. Boldwood walked across the fields to the pool, where he found the farm workers busily washing the sheep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="直到五月底，伯德伍德才鼓起勇气宣布了他的爱情。他来到芭丝谢芭的家，女仆告诉他女主人去看给羊洗澡了。每年春天都在一个特别的池子里给羊洗澡，这样可以清洁羊毛，也可去除羊身上的寄生虫。伯德伍德穿过田地走向池塘，他发现农场工人们都在那里忙着给羊洗澡。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Boldwood realized they had noticed him, and suddenly felt unsure of himself. He did not know enough about women to discover from Bathsheba's manner whether she wanted to see him or not. And so he did not enter the field, but walked on, past the gate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伯德伍德意识到他们在注意自己，他突然感到没有信心。他不很了解女人，所以无法从芭丝谢芭的态度上弄清她是否愿意见他。所以他没有进地里去，而是一直走过了大门。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Bathsheba was standing near them, and saw Boldwood coming towards her. She moved away, walking beside the river, but she could hear footsteps behind her in the grass, and felt love all around her, like perfume in the air Boldwood caught up with her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="芭丝谢芭站在他们跟前，她看到伯德伍德向她走来。她走开了，沿着河边走去，她能听到身后草里的脚步声。她感到她的四周弥漫着爱意，象空气中的香味。伯德伍德追上了她。">查看中文翻译</div>
