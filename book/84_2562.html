<div class="line_en">Audrey asked me to stay. Shawn was too strong, she said, too persuasive, for her to confront him alone. I told her she wasn't alone, she had Mother. Audrey said I didn't understand. No one had believed us after all. If we asked Dad for help, she was sure he'd call us both liars. I told her our parents had changed and we should trust them. Then I boarded a plane and took myself five thousand miles away.</div>

<div class="line_en">I didn't stay long on Buck's Peak, maybe a week. On the day I left the mountain, Audrey asked me not to go. I have no memory of the conversation, but I remember writing the journal entry about it. I wrote it my first night back in Cambridge, while sitting on a stone bridge and staring up at King's College Chapel. I remember the river, which was calm; I remember the slow drift of autumn leaves resting on the glassy surface. I remember the scratch of my pen moving across the page, recounting in detail, for a full eight pages, precisely what my sister had said. But the memory of her saying it is gone: it is as if I wrote in order to forget.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我在巴克峰待的时间不长，大概一个星期。离开山的那天，奥黛丽叫我不要走。那次谈话的内容我不记得了，但我记得写过关于这件事的日记。回到剑桥后的第一晚，我坐在石桥上，凝视着国王学院的教堂，写下了那则日记。我记得那条平静的河流，记得秋日落叶在波光粼粼的河面上缓缓漂流。我记得钢笔在纸上沙沙写字的声音，准确详细地记下了姐姐说过的话，有整整八页的篇幅。但我对她说那番话的记忆消失了，似乎我是为了忘却才写下来的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">If I felt guilty to be documenting my sister's fears from such a safe distance, surrounded by grand libraries and ancient chapels, I gave only one indication of it, in the last line I wrote that night: Cambridge is less beautiful tonight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果我为在如此安全的距离——在宏伟的图书馆和古老的教堂的环绕下——记录下姐姐的恐惧而感到内疚，只有一个迹象可以表明这点。那一晚，在日记的最后一行，我写道：今晚的剑桥不如以前美丽。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But to write what? While reading for my master's thesis, I'd been surprised to discover echoes of Mormon theology in the great philosophers of the nineteenth century. I mentioned this to David Runciman, my supervisor. "That's your project," he said. "You can do something no one has done: you can examine Mormonism not just as a religious movement, but as an intellectual one."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是写什么呢？在为撰写硕士论文而阅读时，我惊讶地发现，十九世纪的伟大哲学家们身上有摩门教神学的影子。我向导师大卫·朗西曼提出这一点。“那就是你的研究项目，”他说，“你可以做前人没研究过的东西：你不仅可以把摩门教视为一场宗教运动，也可以将它作为一场学术运动来研究。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The first term passed in a flurry of dinners and late-night parties, punctuated by even later nights in the library. To qualify for a PhD, I had to produce a piece of original academic research. In other words, having spent five years reading history, I was now being asked to write it.</div>

<div class="line_en">Drew had come with me to Cambridge, having been admitted to a master's program in Middle Eastern studies. I told him about my conversation with Audrey. He was the first boyfriend in whom I confided about my family -- really confided, the truth and not just amusing anecdotes. Of course all that is in the past, I said. My family is different now. But you should know. So you can watch me. In case I do something crazy.</div>

<div class="line_en">But although I wished it were otherwise, I did not want to go home. I preferred the family I had chosen to the one I had been given, so the happier I became in Cambridge, the more my happiness was made fetid by my feeling that I had betrayed Buck's Peak. That feeling became a physical part of me, something I could taste on my tongue or smell on my own breath.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管这并非我所愿，我还是不想回家。我更喜欢自己选择的家庭，而不是被给予的家庭，所以我在剑桥越开心，我的开心就越因为觉得自己背叛了巴克峰而散发着恶臭。这种感觉变成了我身体的一部分，一种我可以在舌头上品尝、在呼吸中闻到的东西。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I began to reread the letters of Joseph Smith and Brigham Young. As a child I'd read those letters as an act of worship; now I read them with different eyes, not the eyes of a critic, but also not the eyes of a disciple. I examined polygamy, not as a doctrine but as a social policy. I measured it against its own aims, as well as against other movements and theories from the same period. It felt like a radical act.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我开始重读约瑟夫·史密斯和杨百翰的信件。小时候读这些信时，我怀着崇拜之情；现在我用不同的眼光重读它们，不是用批评家的眼光，也不是用信徒的眼光。我将一夫多妻制作为一项社会政策，而不是一种教条来解读。我将它与其自身的目标，以及同时期的其他运动和理论进行比较。这感觉就像一种激进的行为。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My friends in Cambridge had become a kind of family, and I felt a sense of belonging with them that, for many years, had been absent on Buck's Peak. Sometimes I felt damned for those feelings. No natural sister should love a stranger more than a brother, I thought, and what sort of daughter prefers a teacher to her own father?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我在剑桥的朋友已经成为家人，与他们在一起让我有一种归属感，这种归属感在巴克峰已经消失了多年。有时这种感觉让我痛苦。我想，没有哪个亲妹妹爱陌生人会胜过爱自己的哥哥，又是什么样的女儿比起父亲会更喜爱自己的老师？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I bought a ticket to Idaho for Christmas. The night before my flight, there was a feast in my college. One of my friends had formed a chamber choir that was to sing carols during dinner. The choir had been rehearsing for weeks, but on the day of the feast the soprano fell ill with bronchitis. My phone rang late that afternoon. It was my friend. "Please tell me you know someone who can sing," he said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="圣诞节我买了一张回爱达荷州的机票。启程前一天晚上，我们学院举办了一次晚宴。我的一位朋友组织了一个室内唱诗班，要在晚宴上唱圣诞颂歌。唱诗班已排练了好几个星期，但在宴会那天，女高音得了支气管炎。那天下午，我的电话响了，是我的那个朋友。“麻烦告诉我，你认识会唱歌的人吗？”他说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I had not sung for years, and never without my father to hear me, but a few hours later I joined the chamber choir on a platform near the rafters, above the massive Christmas tree that dominated the hall. I treasured the moment, taking pleasure in the lightness I felt to have music once again floating up from my chest, and wondering whether Dad, if he were here, would have braved the university and all its socialism to hear me sing. I believed he would.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我已经多年不唱歌了，而且从没在爸爸不在场时唱过，但几个小时后，我加入了室内唱诗班，登上了大厅里巨大的圣诞树上方的椽子附近的平台。我珍惜那一刻，很高兴能再一次感受音乐从胸口浮上来的轻盈感。我也想知道爸爸会不会冒着进入大学和这个国家的风险，来到这里听我唱歌。我相信他会的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Buck's peak was unchanged. The Princess was buried in snow but I could see the deep contours of her legs. Mother was in the kitchen when I arrived, stirring a stew with one hand and with the other holding the phone and explaining the properties of motherwort. Dad's desk was still empty. He was in the basement, Mother said, in bed. Something had hold of his lungs.</div>

<div class="line_en">Two days passed. Dad came upstairs every evening and settled himself into a sofa in the Chapel, where he would cough and watch TV or read the Old Testament. I spent my days studying or helping Mother.</div>

<div class="line_en">A burly stranger shuffled through the back door. Several seconds passed before I recognized my brother. Luke's beard was so thick, he looked like one of his goats. His left eye was white and dead: he'd been shot in the face with a paintball gun a few months before. He crossed the room and clapped me on the back, and I stared into his remaining eye, looking for something familiar. But it wasn't until I saw the raised scar on his forearm, a curved check mark two inches wide from where the Shear had bitten his flesh, that I was sure this man was my brother. He told me he was living with his wife and a pack of kids in a mobile home behind the barn, making his money working oil rigs in North Dakota.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个身材魁梧的陌生人慢吞吞地从后门走了进来。过了几秒钟我才认出那是哥哥卢克。他的胡子那么浓密，看上去和他养的山羊一样。他的左眼是白色的，已经瞎了：几个月前，他的脸被彩弹枪击中。他穿过房间，拍了拍我的背，我盯着他剩下的那只眼睛，寻找熟悉的东西。直到看到他前臂上凸起的伤疤——一个两英寸宽的对勾，正是被大剪刀伤到的地方——我才确定这个人就是我的哥哥。他告诉我，他和妻子还有一群孩子住在谷仓后面的一间活动房里，他在北达科他州的石油钻塔上工作赚钱。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On the third evening I was at the kitchen table, reading, when Shawn and Benjamin shuffled through the back door. Benjamin was telling Shawn about a punch he'd thrown after a fender bender in town. He said that before climbing out of his truck to confront the other driver, he'd slipped his handgun into the waistband of his jeans. "The guy didn't know what he was getting into," Benjamin said, grinning.</div>

<div class="line_en">Shawn spoke calmly, thoughtfully. His blond hair was filthy and uncut, growing wild, and his face was covered in stubble the color of shale. His eyes shone from under the oil and dirt, blazes of blue in clouds of ash. His expression, as well as his words, seemed to belong to a much older man, a man whose hot blood had cooled, who was at peace.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="肖恩平静地说着，面带沉思。他那头金发又脏又乱，也该修剪了。他脸上布满了泥灰色的胡茬，眼睛在油污和尘土下闪闪发光，好像灰云中闪烁的蓝色火焰。他的表情和言谈似乎来自一个比他年纪大得多的人，一个热血已经冷却，与世无争的人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Shawn turned to me. I had been avoiding him, but suddenly that seemed unfair. He had changed; it was cruel to pretend he hadn't. He asked if I'd like to go for a drive, and I said I would. Shawn wanted ice cream so we got milkshakes. The conversation was calm, comfortable, like it had been years before on those dusky evenings in the corral. He told me about running the crew without Dad, about Peter's frail lungs -- about the surgeries and the oxygen tubes he still wore at night.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="肖恩转向我。我一直在躲着他，但突然间，这么做似乎很不公平。他已经变了，假装他没有改变是很残忍的。他问我是否愿意跟他开车兜风，我说好。肖恩想吃冰激凌，于是我们买了冰沙。谈话平静、舒适，就像多年前在畜栏里那些昏暗的夜晚一样。他跟我谈了很多：爸爸不在时他负责管理工作小队；儿子彼得肺部虚弱，做过几次手术，晚上仍戴着氧气管。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Shawn circled the lot, then parked near the main entrance. He switched off the ignition and the headlights faded. I could barely make out the curve of his face in the dark.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他似乎放松了下来，然后说：“奥黛丽就是个爱说谎的贱人。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was crucial that I not look at him. As long as I kept my eyes on the spire, I almost believed he couldn't touch me. Almost. Because even while I clung to this belief, I waited to feel his hands on my neck. I knew I would feel them, and soon, but I didn't dare do anything that might break the spell of waiting. In that moment part of me believed, as I had always believed, that it would be me who broke the spell, who caused it to break. When the stillness shattered and his fury rushed at me, I would know that something I had done was the catalyst, the cause. There is hope in such a superstition; there is the illusion of control.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="绝对不能看他。我几乎相信，只要我的眼睛一直盯着教堂尖顶，他就不会动我。只是几乎相信，因为即使我紧抓这个念头不放，我也等待感受到他的手落在我的脖子上。我知道很快就会感受到他的双手，但我一动不敢动，不敢打破这个等待的魔咒。那一刻某种程度上我相信，就像我一直相信的那样，打破魔咒、解除魔法的人会是我。当寂静被打破，他愤怒地冲向我，我就会知道肯定是我做了什么，成了催化剂和导火索。这种迷信中透露着希望，给人能掌控局面的错觉。">查看中文翻译</div>
