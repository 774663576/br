<div class="line_en">Neither Hans Hubermann nor Alex Steiner was sent to fight. Alex was sent to Austria, to an army hospital outside Vienna. Given his expertise in tailoring, he was given a job that at least resembled his profession. Cartloads of uniforms and socks and shirts would come in every week and he would mend what needed mending, even if they could only be used as underclothes for the suffering soldiers in Russia.</div>

<div class="line_en">Hans was about to ask the obvious question when a voice arrived from behind. Attached to it was the slender face of a young man with a smile like a sneer. Reinhold Zucker. "With us," he said, "the enemy isn't over the hill or in any specific direction. It's all around." He returned his focus to the letter he was writing. "You'll see."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汉斯正打算顺着他的话问下去，身后突然传来一个声音。声音的主人是一位脸形瘦长的年轻人，无论怎么笑都像是在冷嘲热讽。他叫赖因霍尔德·楚克尔。他说：“我们的敌人可不在山上，也不在任何特定的方向。他们就在我们左右。”他又低下头写手头的信。“你会明白的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As the war flew into Germany with more intensity, Hans would learn that every one of his shifts started in the same fashion. The men would gather at the truck to be briefed on what had been hit during their break, what was most likely to be hit next, and who was working with whom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="战争愈发猛烈地向德国本土推进，在汉斯眼里，每一次轮班都大同小异。大家在卡车边上集合，听取报告，比如他们休息的时候有哪些地方遭受了空袭，接下来又有哪些地方可能遭受袭击，以及谁和谁分到一组。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When he arrived, Hans could only guess what those men had done to deserve such a task, and in turn, they wondered the same of him. Their leader, Sergeant Boris Schipper, asked him straight out. When Hans explained the bread, the Jews, and the whip, the round-faced sergeant gave out a short spurt of laughter. "You're lucky to be alive." His eyes were also round and he was constantly wiping them. They were either tired or itchy or full of smoke and dust. "Just remember that the enemy here is not in front of you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="初来乍到的时候，汉斯很好奇这些战友到底是因为做了什么，才被分配到这种岗位上，他们对他也同样好奇。他们的头头鲍里斯·席佩中士就直截了当地问了他。当汉斯一五一十地把面包、犹太人和挨鞭子的经过讲给他听时，圆脸的中士竟然哈哈大笑，“能活下来都算你运气好了。”他有一双圆眼睛，时常用手去抹，要么是因为痒，要么是因为劳累，也可能是因为眼睛里沾了烟尘。“你只要记住，在这里，敌人可不会跟你面对面。”">查看中文翻译</div>
