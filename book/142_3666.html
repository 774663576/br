<div class="line_en">The Sicilian sun, early-morning lemon-colored, filled Michael's bedroom. He awoke and, feeling Apollonia's satiny body against his own sleep-warm skin, made her come awake with love. When they were done, even all the months of complete possession could not stop him from marveling at her beauty and her passion.</div>

<div class="line_en">She left the bedroom to wash and dress in the bathroom down the hall. Michael, still naked, the morning sun refreshing his body, lit a cigarette and relaxed on the bed. This was the last morning they would spend in this house and the villa. Don Tommasino had arranged for him to be transferred to another town on the southern coast of Sicily. Apollonia, in the first month of pregnancy, wanted to visit with her family for a few weeks and would join him at the new hiding place after the visit.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她离开了卧室，到楼下洗澡间去洗澡，穿衣服去了。迈克尔仍然赤棵裸的，清晨的阳光照在他身上，使他感到很清新，便点了一支香烟，轻轻松松地躺在床上。这是他们俩在这幢房子里，在这个别墅度过的最后一个早晨。托马辛诺老头子已经安排好了，要把他转移到西西里南海岸去。阿波罗妮娅刚好是怀孕的第一个月，想回娘家待上几个星期，再到新的秘密避难所同他团聚。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The night before, Don Tommasino had sat with Michael in the garden after Apollonia had gone to bed. The Don had been worried and tired, and admitted that he was concerned about Michael's safety. "Your marriage brought you into sight," he told Michael: "I'm surprised your father hasn't made arrangements for you to go someplace else. In any case I'm having my own troubles with the young Turks in Palermo. I've offered some fair arrangements so that they can wet their beaks more than they deserve, but those scum want everything. I can't understand their attitude. They've tried a few little tricks but I'm not so easy to kill. They must know I'm too strong for them to hold me so cheaply. But that's the trouble with young people, no matter how talented. They don't reason things out and they want all the water in the well."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="头一天晚上，在阿波罗妮娅上床后，托马辛诺老头子同迈克尔在花园里聊天。老头子愁容满面，精神不振，坦率地说，他对迈克尔的安全很担心。“你结了婚，就公开露面了，”他对迈克尔说，“我感到诧异的是，你爸爸没有安排你到别的地方去躲一躲。说来说去问题就在于我本人目前正同巴勒莫新音出来的野心家闹矛盾。我主动提出了一些公平合理的安排，这样他们就可以从中捞到比他们应得的还要多的油水。但是那伙地痞流氓贪得无厌，寸利必得，他们已经玩弄了一些鬼把戏，设置了一些圈套，但要杀害我这个人可不那么容易。他们必须明白，我也不是好惹的，要制服我可也不那么容易。年轻人都有这种初生牛犊不怕虎的毛病。他们不讲道理，想把公井里的水全部攫为己有。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Michael had known Don Tommasino was in trouble. Armed guards patrolled the walls of the villa at night and a few faithful shepherds with their luparas were always in the house. Don Tommasino himself went heavily armed and a personal bodyguard attended him at all times.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔也旱知道托马辛诺老头子处境困难。武装警卫通宵巡视别墅围墙，另有几个带着滑膛枪的忠诚牧民昼夜守卫在房子里面。托马辛诺老头子本人也全副武装，另外还有一个保镖时刻跟随着他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And then Don Tommasino had told Michael that the two shepherds, Fabrizzio and Calo, would go with him as bodyguards in the Alfa Romeo. Don Tommasino would say his good-byes tonight since he would be off early in the morning, at dawn, to see to his affairs in Palermo. Also, Michael was not to tell Dr. Taza about the move, since the doctor planned to spend the evening in Palermo and might blab.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着，托马辛诺老头子告诉迈克尔说，法布里吉奥和加洛打算同他一道坐“小罗密欧”，去给他当保镖。托马辛诺老头子就在今晚给他送行，因为明天一大早，他就得动身到巴勒莫去。迈克尔没有把这次搬动的事告诉塔查大夫，因为这位大夫当晚要到巴勒莫去过夜，怕他乱说话而走漏消息。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The morning sun was now too strong. Michael stubbed out his cigarette and put on work pants, work shirt and the peaked cap most Sicilian men wore. Still barefooted, he leaned out his bedroom window and saw Fabrizzio sitting in one of the garden chairs. Fabrizzio was lazily combing his thick dark hair, his lupara was carelessly thrown acres the garden table. Michael whistled and Fabrizzio looked up to his window.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="上午的太阳太晒人了。迈克尔掐灭了香烟头，穿上了工作裤，工作衫，戴上了大多数西西里男子常戴的那种鸭嘴帽。他还赤着脚，把身子探出窗外，看到法布里吉臭在花园里的一把椅子上坐着。他正懒洋洋地梳理他那浓密的黑头发，他那支滑膛枪随随便便地斜着放在花园里的桌面上。迈克尔吹了一声口哨，法布里吉奥抬头望着迈克尔的窗口。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Fabrizzio stood up. His shirt was open, exposing the blue and red lines of the tattoo on his chest. "Calo is having a cup of coffee in the kitchen," Fabrizzio said. "Is your wife coming with you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="法布里吉奥站了起来。他的衬衫前襟是敞开的，胸前的蓝、红两色线条所构成的刺花露了出来。“加洛到厨房里去喝咖啡去了，”法布里吉奥说。“你的妻子打算同你一道去吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Michael went down the hall to wash. Apollonia was gone. She was most likely in the kitchen preparing his breakfast with her own hands to wash out the guilt she felt because she wanted to see her family one more time before going so far away to the other end of Sicily. Don Tommasino would arrange transportation for her to where Michael would be.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔下楼洗澡去了。阿彼罗妮娅已经不在洗澡间。她很可能是在厨房。她想用亲手给他做早餐的办法来减轻她的罪过。她感到自己有罪是因为她在去西西里边远地区之前，又想要回一趟娘家而不得不让他过一段单身汉生活。托马辛诺老头子将负责安排把她转送到迈克尔拟定要去的地方。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Michael squinted down at him. It occurred to him that Fabrizzio had been following Apollonia too much with his eyes the last few weeks. Not that he would dare ever to make an advance toward the wife of a friend of the Don's. In Sicily there was no surerroad to death. Michael said coldly, "No, she's going home to her family first, she'll join us in a few days." He watched Fabrizzio hurry into the stone hut that served as a garage for the Alfa Romeo.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔眯着眼打量着他，蓦地感到最近好几个星期以来，法布里吉奥的目光过分地盯着阿波罗妮娅。迈克尔冷冰冰地说，“眼下不去。她要先回娘家住几天，过后再会。”他注视着法布里吉奥急急忙忙走进了用作“小罗密欧”停车的小屋。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Down in the kitchen the old woman Filomena brought him his coffee and shyly bid him a good bye. 'I'll remember you to my father," Michael said and she nodded.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在楼下厨房里，那个叫作斐洛必娜的老太婆给他端来了咖啡，并祝他一路平安。“将来我向我爸爸转达你的问候，”迈克尔说。她点了点头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Calo came into the kitchen and said to Michael, "The car's outside, shall I get your bag?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="加洛来到厨房，对迈克尔说：“汽车就在外面等着，要我去拿你的皮包吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Calo's face broke into an amused grin. "She's sitting in the driver's seat of the car, dying to step on the gas. She'll be a real American woman before she gets to America." It was unheard of for one of the peasant women in Sicily to attempt driving a car. But Michael sometimes let Apollonia guide the Alfa Romeo around the inside of the villa walls, always beside her however because she sometimes stepped on the gas when she meant to step on the brake.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="加洛笑了：“她正坐在驾驶室想开车，想得要命。她在回到美国之前，就会成为一个地道的美国太太。”在西西里，一个农村妇女想开汽车，这是从来没有听说过的今古奇谈。但是，迈克尔有时就让阿波罗妮姬驾驶“小罗密欧”，绕着别墅围墙里侧转圈子，不过每次他都坐在她身旁，因为她有时候踏刹车，心里一急就踩到油门上了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Michael said to Calo, "Get Fabrizzio and wait for me in the car." He went out of the kitchen and ran up the stairs to the bedroom. His bag was already packed. Before picking it up he looked out the window and saw the car parked in front of the portico steps rather than the kitchen entrance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔对加洛说：“快找法布里吉奥去，就在汽车里等着我。”他走出厨房，跑上楼，到了卧室。他的皮包早已装好了，在拿皮包之前，他从窗口朝外张望了一下，看到汽车是停在门廊台阶下面而不是停在厨房门口。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Filomena's wrinkled face was sly. "Old roosters can't greet the sun. The doctor went to Palermo last night."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斐洛必娜皮笑肉不笑地说：“老公鸡不能报晓了，不能欢呼太阳初升了。大夫昨晚上就到巴勒莫去了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Apollonia was sitting in the car, her hands on the wheel like a child playing. Calo was just putting the lunch basket in the rear seat. And then Michael was annoyed to see Fabrizzio disappearing through the gates of the villa on some errand outside. What the hell was he doing? He saw Fabrizzio take a look over his shoulder, a look that was somehow furtive. He'd have to straighten that damn shepherd out. Michael went down the stairs and decided to go through the kitchen to see Filomena again and give her a final farewell. He asked the old woman, "Is Dr. Taza still sleeping?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿波罗妮娅在汽车里坐着，她的双手好像小孩子在玩耍似地在方向盘上动来动去。加洛正在给后面座位上放午餐提篮。接着，迈克尔看到法布里吉奥出了别墅大门。他究竟为什么要出去？他还看到法市里吉奥回头看了一下，神色莫名其妙，有点鬼鬼祟祟。他得把那个该死的牧民教训教训才行。迈克尔下了楼梯，决定顺便穿过厨房，再看看斐洛必娜，向她最后告别一下。他问那个老太婆：“塔查大夫还在睡觉吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Michael laughed. He went out the kitchen entrance and the smell of lemon blossoms penetrated even his sinus-filled nose. He saw Apollonia wave to him from the car just ten paces up the villa's driveway and then he realized she was motioning him to stay where he was, that she meant to drive the car to where he stood. Calo stood grinning beside the car, his lupara dangling in his hand. But there was still no sign of Fabrizzio. At that moment; without any conscious reasoning process, everything came together in his mind, and Michael shouted to the girl, "No! No!" But his shout was drowned in the roar of the tremendous explosion as Apollonia switched on the ignition. The kitchen door shattered into fragments and Michael was hurled along the wall of the villa for a good ten feet. Stones tumbling from the villa roof hit him on the shoulders and one glanced off his skull as he was lying on the ground. He was conscious just long enough to see that nothing remained of the Alfa Romeo but its four wheels and the steel shafts which held them together.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔哈哈大笑起来。他走出厨房门，一阵柠檬花香扑鼻而来，即使他那鼻窦是塞着的，也还是能闻出香气。他看到阿波罗妮娅在十步远的停车道上从汽车里向他招手。他马上明白了她的意思就是要他待在那儿，她想把汽车开过来，开到他跟前。加洛站在汽车旁边，呲牙咧嘴地笑着，他一只手提着滑膛枪的背带，枪在下面一甩一甩的。但是，仍然不见法布里吉奥的影子，此刻，没有经过任何推理过程，他恍然大悟，于是对他妻子大声喊道：“别开！别开车！”但是，阿彼罗妮娅刚踩油门，搭上火，只听得轰隆了一阵巨响，他的喊声早被淹没在强烈的爆炸声中了。厨房门也给炸成了碎片；迈克尔被冲击波扔出足足十步远。别墅屋顶上的石头塌了下来，打在他的肩膀上，一块石头从他的脑壳上擦了过去，他栽倒在地了。他在昏过去之前，刚好看到“小罗密欧”只剩下了四个轮子和连接轮子的钢轴大梁，别的全都无影无踪了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Let me look at you a minute and I'll put the light out," Dr,. Taza said gently. He was busy shining a small pencil flashlight into Michael's eyes. "You'll be all right," Dr. Taza said and turned to someone else in the room. "You can speak to him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“让我瞧瞧你，过一会儿就熄灯，”塔查大夫温柔地说。他用一支小得像铅笔一样的电筒照了照迈克尔的眼睛。“你很快就会好的。”塔查大夫说罢，回头对屋子里的另一个人说：“如今你可以同他说话了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He came to consciousness in a room that seemed very dark and heard voices that were so low that they were pure sound rather than words. Out of animal instinct he tried to pretend he was still unconscious but the voices stopped and someone was leaning from a chair close to his bed and the voice was distinct now, saying, "Well, he's with us finally." A lamp went on, its light like white fire on his eyeballs and Michael turned his head. It felt very heavy, numb. And then he could see the face over his bed was that of Dr. Taza.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他醒过来了，发现自己睡在一间非常黑暗的屋子里，同时也听到了人声，声音非常低，与其说是说话声，还不如说是唧唧喳喳声。出于本能，他竭力装做仍然昏迷的样子。但声音停止了，那个坐在椅子上的人，把身子侧过来，紧挨着他的床。“好啦，他终于同意我们的意见了。”一盏灯亮了，灯光照射在他的眼睛上就像白色的火光。迈克尔把头转了过来，头非常沉重、麻木。接着，他就可以看到扑到他床上面的塔查大夫的脸。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Michael, without knowing he did so, smiled. It was in some strange way, a chilling smile, of assent. Don Tommasino said, "Fabrizzio has vanished. Listen to me, Michael. You've been unconscious for nearly a week. Do you understand? Everybody thinks you're dead, so you're safe now, they've stopped looking for you. I've sent messages to your father and he's sent back instructions. It won't be long now, you'll be back in America. Meanwhile you'll rest here quietly. You're safe up in the mountains, in a special farmhouse I own. The Palermo people have made their peace with me now that you're supposed to be dead, so it was you they were after all the time. They wanted to kill you while making people think it was me they were after. That's something you should know. As for everything else, leave it all to me. You recover your strength and be tranquil."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔不知道是不是他把汽车从停车房里开出来的，只是笑了一下。他这一笑，是一种令人毛骨悚然的冷笑，是一种表示默认的冷笑。托马辛诺老头子说：“法布里吉奥溜掉了。听我说，迈克尔，你昏迷了差不多一星期，你懂吗？大家都认为你早已死了，因此你如今也就安全了，人家不会再打听你了。我已经捎信给你爸爸，他也把命令送来了。目前看来，用不着多久你就可回美国去，在等待回美国的同时，你就安安静静地在这儿休息吧。你待在山区里，待在我自己农场的特别住房里，是安全的。因为外面都认为你死了，所以巴勒莫那些家伙也同我讲和了。这样看来，人家原来挖空心思想干掉的始终都是你。人家想杀害的本来也是你，但却故弄玄虚，让人们认为他们想干掉我。这一点你应该知道，至于别的一切，你甭管，由我负责好了。你就好好将息着，安心将息着。”">查看中文翻译</div>
