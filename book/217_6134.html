<div class="line_en">They swarmed up towards Sherburn's house, awhooping and raging like Injuns, and everything had to clear the way or get run over and tromped to mush, and it was awful to see. Children was heeling it ahead of the mob, screaming and trying to get out of the way; and every window along the road was full of women's heads, and there was nigger boys in every tree, and bucks and wenches looking over every fence; and as soon as the mob would get nearly to them they would break and skaddle back out of reach. Lots of the women and girls was crying and taking on, scared most to death.</div>

Sherburn run his eye slow along the crowd; and wherever it struck the people tried a little to outgaze him, but they couldn't; they dropped their eyes and looked sneaky.

<div class="line_en">"The idea of YOU lynching anybody! It's amusing. The idea of you thinking you had pluck enough to lynch a MAN! Because you're brave enough to tar and feather poor friendless cast-out women that come along here, did that make you think you had grit enough to lay your hands on a MAN? Why, a MAN'S safe in the hands of ten thousand of your kind – as long as it's daytime and you're not behind him.</div>

In the North he lets anybody walk over him that wants to, and goes home and prays for a humble spirit to bear it. In the South one man all by himself, has stopped a stage full of men in the daytime, and robbed the lot. Your newspapers call you a brave people so much that you think you are braver than any other people – whereas you're just AS brave, and no braver. Why don't your juries hang murderers? Because they're afraid the man's friends will shoot them in the back, in the dark – and it's just what they WOULD do.</div>

But if only HALF a man – like Buck Harkness, there – shouts 'Lynch him! lynch him!' you're afraid to back down – afraid you'll be found out to be what you are – COWARDS – and so you raise a yell, and hang yourselves on to that half-a-man's coat-tail, and come raging up here, swearing what big things you're going to do. The pitifulest thing out is a mob; that's what an army is – a mob; they don't fight with courage that's born in them, but with courage that's borrowed from their mass, and from their officers. But a mob without any MAN at the head of it is BENEATH pitifulness. Now the thing for YOU to do is to droop your tails and go home and crawl in a hole. If any real lynching's going to be done it will be done in the dark, Southern fashion; and when they come they'll bring their masks, and fetch a MAN along. Now LEAVE – and take your half-a-man with you" – tossing his gun up across his left arm and cocking it when he says this.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a real bully circus. It was the splendidest sight that ever was when they all come riding in, two and two, a gentleman and lady, side by side, the men just in their drawers and undershirts, and no shoes nor stirrups, and resting their hands on their thighs easy and comfortable – there must a been twenty of them – and every lady with a lovely complexion, and perfectly beautiful, and looking just like a gang of real sure-enough queens, and dressed in clothes that cost millions of dollars, and just littered with diamonds. It was a powerful fine sight; I never see anything so lovely. And then one by one they got up and stood, and went a-weaving around the ring so gentle and wavy and graceful, the men looking ever so tall and airy and straight, with their heads bobbing and skimming along, away up there under the tent-roof, and every lady's rose-leafy dress flapping soft and silky around her hips, and she looking like the most loveliest parasol.</div>

<div class="line_en">And then faster and faster they went, all of them dancing, first one foot out in the air and then the other, the horses leaning more and more, and the ringmaster going round and round the center-pole, cracking his whip and shouting "Hi! – hi!" and the clown cracking jokes behind him; and by and by all hands dropped the reins, and every lady put her knuckles on her hips and every gentleman folded his arms, and then how the horses did lean over and hump themselves! And so one after the other they all skipped off into the ring, and made the sweetest bow I ever see, and then scampered out, and everybody clapped their hands and went just about wild.</div>

<div class="line_en">Well, all through the circus they done the most astonishing things; and all the time that clown carried on so it most killed the people. The ringmaster couldn't ever say a word to him but he was back at him quick as a wink with the funniest things a body ever said; and how he ever COULD think of so many of them, and so sudden and so pat, was what I couldn't noway understand. Why, I couldn't a thought of them in a year. And by and by a drunk man tried to get into the ring – said he wanted to ride; said he could ride as well as anybody that ever was. They argued and tried to keep him out, but he wouldn't listen, and the whole show come to a standstill. Then the people begun to holler at him and make fun of him, and that made him mad, and he begun to rip and tear; so that stirred up the people, and a lot of men begun to pile down off of the benches and swarm towards the ring, saying, "Knock him down! throw him out!" and one or two women begun to scream. So, then, the ringmaster he made a little speech, and said he hoped there wouldn't be no disturbance, and if the man would promise he wouldn't make no more trouble he would let him ride if he thought he could stay on the horse. So everybody laughed and said all right, and the man got on. The minute he was on, the horse begun to rip and tear and jump and cavort around, with two circus men hanging on to his bridle trying to hold him, and the drunk man hanging on to his neck, and his heels flying in the air every jump, and the whole crowd of people standing up shouting and laughing till tears rolled down. And at last, sure enough, all the circus men could do, the horse broke loose, and away he went like the very nation, round and round the ring, with that sot laying down on him and hanging to his neck, with first one leg hanging most to the ground on one side, and then t'other one on t'other side, and the people just crazy. It warn't funny to me, though; I was all of a tremble to see his danger. But pretty soon he struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridle, a-reeling this way and that; and the next minute he sprung up and dropped the bridle and stood! and the horse a-going like a house afire too. He just stood up there, a-sailing around as easy and comfortable as if he warn't ever drunk in his life – and then he begun to pull off his clothes and sling them. He shed them so thick they kind of clogged up the air, and altogether he shed seventeen suits. And, then, there he was, slim and handsome, and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest you ever saw, and he lit into that horse with his whip and made him fairly hum – and finally skipped off, and made his bow and danced off to the dressing-room, and everybody just a-howling with pleasure and astonishment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="马戏团的表演，从开头到末了，全都叫人惊心动魄，那小丑从中的插科打诨，又差点儿叫人笑死。领班每说一句，一眨眼间，他总能回敬他一些好笑透顶的话。他怎么能想得出那么多的笑话，又能说得那么突如其来，那么恰到好处，真叫我弄不明白，哈，换了是我的话，花一年时间，我也想不出来啊。隔了一会儿，一个醉鬼要闯进场子里去——说自己要骑马，还说自己能骑得跟别人一样高明。人家就跟他争论起来，想不让他进去。他偏偏不听，整个儿的演出便停了下来。大家伙儿就对他起哄，开他的玩笑，这下子可把他惹火了，惹得他乱蹦乱骂。这样一来，大家伙儿也火了，便纷纷从长凳上站起来，朝场上涌过去，一边喊“揍得他躺下来！把他给扔出去！”有一两个女的尖声叫了起来。这时，领班演说了几句，说他希望不要闹出乱子来。还说只要这个男子保证不闹出乱子，他就可以让他骑马，只要他认为自己能骑在马上坐得稳稳当当。这样，在场的一个个都乐了，说这样也行。那个人便骑上了马。他一骑上马背，马便乱蹦乱跳，一边绕着圈儿撩蹶子，马戏班的两个人使劲拖住马鞍子，想扶住他。那个醉鬼呢，使劲抓住了马脖子。马每跳一回，他的脚后跟便被抛向空中一回。全场观众乐得站立起来，大喊大笑，笑得眼泪直流。临了，尽管马戏班的人想尽法子，那匹马还是挣脱开了，疯了似地绕着场飞奔起来，醉鬼伏在马背上，使劲抓住脖子，一只脚几乎在一边拖到了地上，接着另一只脚也差点儿拖到地上了，观众就乐得几乎发了疯似的。对这一些，我倒并不觉得什么好玩。只是看到他这么危险，我不禁为他捏了一把汗。不过并没有多久，他就用力一挣，跨上了马鞍，抓住缰绳，晃到这一边，又晃到那一边，坐立不稳。再歇了一会儿，他又一跃而起，撒开了缰绳，站立在马背上啦！那只马呢，仿佛象屋子着了火似地飞奔了起来。他笔挺地站在马背上，绕着圈子走，神态自自然然，似乎此人平生滴酒不沾——随后他把身上衣服脱掉，然后摔掉。他脱下的衣服那么多，扔得那么快，一时只见空中尽是一团团的衣服，他一共脱了十六件衣服。这时刻，但见他站在马背之上，英俊，漂亮，一身打扮花哨、华丽得见所未见。他这时马鞭子一挥，在马身上使劲地抽，逼着马拼命地跑——最后他跳下马来，一鞠躬，翩然退场，回到更衣室去，全场观众又喜又惊，发狂地吼叫。">查看中文翻译</div>

Well, I felt sheepish enough to be took in so, but I wouldn't a been in that ringmaster's place, not for a thousand dollars.

So the duke said these Arkansaw lunkheads couldn't come up to Shakespeare; what they wanted was low comedy – and maybe something ruther worse than low comedy, he reckoned.
