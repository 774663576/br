<div class="line_en">"Where do you think we're going?" Charlie asks me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The clothes arrive the next morning. Boxes of weatherproof jackets and parkas, winter hats, trousers, thermal underwear and boots. None of it ostentatious, but all designer-branded and clearly expensive. Then a cabin suitcase for each of us, and folders containing used Russian international passports, driving licenses, credit cards and other identifying papers in the same names.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We drive northwest, following the signs to Sheremetyevo airport. Visibility is limited, and the road surface treacherous. The outlines of broken-down vehicles are visible on the hard shoulder, hazard lights winking. I'm nervous, but glad that Oxana is at my side. I'm even glad, in a perverse sort of way, that Charlie's there.</div>

<div class="line_en">We leave at midday, and as we step out of the lift in our designer outfits and follow Richard through the building's endless succession of lobbies, no one gives us a second glance. We could be an upscale tour group, or prosperous Russians setting off on holiday. Outside, it's wonderfully cold, and I turn into the wind for a moment so that the snowflakes fly into my face. Then, all too soon, we're climbing into a Porsche SUV with dark-tinted windows. Anton drives, Richard takes the front seat, and I sit between Oxana and Charlie.</div>

<div class="line_en">We're crossing the outer ring road when a police vehicle swings in front of us, blue lights flashing. "Fuck's sake," Anton mutters, bringing the Porsche to a halt in the slush. "What now?"</div>

<div class="line_en">There's a sharp tap on the passenger-side window and Richard lowers it. The features of the uniformed figure outside are obscured by his helmet and face mask, but his shoulder patch identifies him as an officer of the FSB, Russia's internal security service. Ahead of us, other vehicles similar to ours have been stopped. Several drivers and passengers have been ordered out of their cars and directed, documents in hand, to an armored truck with iron-grille windows and FSB insignia, parked on the side of the highway.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Security check. Passports please?"</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We hand them over, he checks them carefully, and peers at us one by one through the passenger window. Then he returns all the passports except mine. "Out please," he tells me, pointing to the truck with a gloved hand.</div>

<div class="line_en">It's freezing outside, and I pull the hood of my parka over my head as I join the line outside the truck. "Must be looking for someone important," I say to the woman in front of me, a grandmotherly figure in a pink woolen headscarf.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Eventually, it's my turn. I climb the steps into the truck, and when I get inside stand for a few seconds, eyes narrowed. It's dark in there after the snow-brightness. Two officers are sitting on metal benches opposite me, and one is in the shadows to my left. At a signal from the man in the shadows the others leave.</div>

<div class="line_en">Vadim Tikhomirov is a senior officer of the FSB. A general, in fact, although he's not the kind of man to advertise his rank. We first met in complicated circumstances after Charlie -- or Lara as they were then -- tried and failed to shoot me in the VDNKh Metro station in Moscow. On that occasion Tikhomirov not only got me out of Russia, he discreetly alerted me to the fact that my boss, Richard Edwards, was an asset of the Twelve.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tikhomirov is the refined face of an often brutally uncompromising organization, and where his own loyalties lie I'm not sure. Is he, as he appears to be, a dedicated servant of the Russian state, and if so, what does that actually entail? Unquestioning obedience to the diktats of the Kremlin, or the playing of longer, more ambiguous games?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He leans toward me on the bench. "Eve, we have very little time. If we don't keep this short your friends outside are going to be suspicious. First, you've done brilliantly to insert yourself into a Twelve operation."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I saw the photograph. It was good, and would have fooled most people but… what do they say? Don't bullshit a bullshitter. In our world, as you know, nothing is what it looks like, even life and death. Everything's a simulacrum."</div>

<div class="line_en">"How do I know this? Let's just say that we have a friend in common in St. Petersburg. But it's imperative that we discover what the Twelve are planning, because if what I suspect is true the consequences will be catastrophic, and not just for Russia. So you absolutely have to find out, Eve. And you have to tell me."</div>

<div class="line_en">"This is the Twelve we're dealing with, Eve. We need to take down the whole organization, and if we're going to do that we need to aim a lot higher than Edwards. He's useful to them but he's replaceable, and probably doesn't know that much anyway."</div>

<div class="line_en">"So, we need to keep our nerve, let them think it's safe to go ahead, and wait for the key players to reveal themselves. Then, and only then, can we make our move. First we have to know what they've been planning."</div>

<div class="line_en">Richard leaves us on the tarmac at Sheremetyevo airport, beneath a bruise-dark sky. He shakes our hands through the driver's window of the Porsche, and gives us each a taut, crinkle-eyed smile that doesn't quite mask his relief that he's not coming with us. How did I work for him for so long without spotting that phony manner?</div>

<div class="line_en">Oxana sits next to me, her head on my shoulder, and we talk about the things we'll do, and the places we'll visit, when all of this is over. We both know it's a fantasy, that we'll probably never walk hand in hand by the River Neva in St. Petersburg, watching the ice floes drift past, or sit in the sun on a spring morning in the courtyard of Oxana's favorite café in Paris, but we promise ourselves these things and more. I say nothing about my conversation with Tikhomirov. I try not to think about it at all, and to ignore the ghastly sensation that we are sleepwalking toward a cliff edge. Instead, I lose myself in the moment, feeling the soft weight of Oxana's head on my shoulder.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Learjet lifts off shortly afterward, heading westwards. Our immediate destination, Anton tells us, is Ostend, in Belgium. No one inquires further.</div>

<div class="line_en">After forty-five minutes we start our descent. The helicopter's spotlights illuminate dark, wrinkling waves. "We're there," Oxana mouths at me. "Look." She jabs a finger downwards.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Oxana tucks in next to me again, but with the engine noise and the headsets conversation is impossible. Where we're going, I have no idea, although Oxana's pensive expression suggests that she may have figured it out. We hold a roughly northwestern course toward England, but why would we be traveling there by helicopter? If our destination is London, we could have flown there directly from Moscow. Are we going to be landing on a ship?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After three and a half hours we land at Ostend-Bruges airport. The light has almost gone, and as we leave the warmly upholstered interior of the Learjet we're met with a bitter wind and driving sleet. A minibus is waiting for us on the tarmac, and we're driven a few hundred meters to a waiting Super Puma helicopter, where the pilot hands us noise-canceling headsets. The helicopter's rotors are already swinging as we board, and the lights of the airport vanish behind us as we gain height over desolate beaches and the wind-blurred expanse of the North Sea.</div>

<div class="line_en">We walk the length of the platform, heads down, to where three converted shipping containers are lashed to the decking with steel hawsers. Anton guides us inside the nearest of these, flicks on an electric light, and when we're all inside, including the two men who guided in the helicopter, closes the steel door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At first I see only the surface of the sea. Then a gray rectangle swings into view, and the Super Puma's spotlights lock on to it. A marine platform, its size hard to estimate, supported by two trunk-like columns. As we approach the platform I see that there's a helipad at one end, which two tiny human figures are illuminating with torches. Never in my life have I seen anything so unforgivingly harsh. "Fucking hell," I mouth at Oxana, and she nods.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We touch down, and the Super Puma rests on the helipad for no more than thirty seconds as we climb out into the bitter, sleeting wind. It's so ferocious, I'm afraid that if I lose my footing I'll be swept away, and I cling to the arm of the nearest person, who happens to be Anton. He shouts something to me, but it's whipped away in the wind.</div>

They're former E Squadron sniper team leaders, so they know their stuff. Lara and Villanelle, I know you have experience as solo operatives, but this project poses unique challenges.

<div class="line_en">It's not much, but it's a lot more homey than the last container I was in. Two double-glazed windows have been let in to the lengthways wall, framing views of the sea and the sky. At one end there's a trestle table and six folding chairs, at the other a microwave, a chest freezer, and a kettle. A tray on the table holds jars of honey, Marmite, and strawberry jam. Above it, there's a bookshelf stocked with well-thumbed paperback thrillers by Mick Herron, Andrei Kivinov, and others, and a hardback copy of Mangan and Proctor's Birds of the North Sea.</div>

<div class="line_en">It's at this point that I lose hope. There's no way to contact Tikhomirov, and as I have no clue as to the identity of the target, or targets, there's no point in thinking about how to do so. Anton, moreover, clearly has no intention of telling us the details of the hit until the absolute last moment. Maybe he doesn't even know them. The fact that we have been flown all the way to the middle of the North Sea, rather than to a secure facility in Russia, tells me how concerned the Twelve are that no word of this operation should get out. We're confined to this tiny, isolated, storm-battered platform with no possibility of escape, and no way of contacting the outside world.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The two teams will be training separately," Anton continues. "Villanelle and I with Nobby, Charlie and Eve with Ginge. Neither team will discuss the details of their mission with the other team. You all have separate quarters, three in the north leg of the platform, three in the south, and there will be no doubling up." He looks balefully from me to Oxana. "This is not a request, it's an order."</div>

<div class="line_en">Watching Anton, with his too-pale eyes, wolfish jaw and thin, fastidious mouth, I can't suppress a shiver. He's one of those men whose hatred of women is so deep, so central to his being, that it almost defines him. He knows where he stands with men. With Richard he's subtly obsequious; with Nobby and Ginge matey but superior. He's pretty sure where he stands with me, too, as I'm too much of a scaredy-cat to give him much trouble. But he has no idea how to deal with Charlie and Oxana, who are every bit as hardcore as he is, and not frightened to let him know it. I turn to Oxana but she is staring expressionlessly into space. Impossible to tell what she thinks of the sleeping arrangements.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This briefing is followed by a meal of warm baked beans and luncheon meat prepared by Nobby, during which Oxana remains wordless and withdrawn, refusing to meet my eye. As hurtful as this is, it no longer surprises me. I'm familiar with her mood cycle. I know that when I say good night to her, she will look straight through me, and she does.</div>

<div class="line_en">At breakfast -- tea, bacon sandwiches -- I team up with Charlie and Ginge, a stocky, balding Welshman with a twinkling smile. "Lovely day for it," he grins, as the wind screams across the platform deck outside. He leads us to one end of the deck, where two makeshift hides, about ten meters apart, have been constructed from oil drums and tarpaulin. On the ground beneath the tarpaulin is a low mattress, and on the mattress is a sniper rifle with scope attachment, a metal ammunition box, and a waterproof rucksack. The edge of the platform is no more than two meters in front of us. Far below, the sea churns and boils, dashing itself against the platform's concrete legs.</div>

It's tiny but it's private, and there's a freshwater shower heated by a generator. I try very hard to enjoy the sixty-odd seconds of steaming hot water I allow myself. I suspect I'm going to spend most of the day feeling very cold indeed.</div>

<div class="line_en">I see Charlie tense up at being called a girl, and then deliberately relax. We settle into our places on the mattress.

<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"In that case you'll probably know a lot of what I've got to tell you, but listen up anyway. This job is going to be a very tricky one. I'm not aware of the location of the firing point, or the identity of the target. But I do know that the window of opportunity is going to be very small, probably just seconds, the target will be moving, and the range will be in excess of seven hundred meters. So Charlie, you are going to have to act very fast and very decisively, while remaining very calm. Eve, your job is to make sure that she can do that.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"So first, your weapon. It's a British-made AX sniper rifle with a Nightforce scope. The rifle's light, it's smooth-firing and it's very accurate. Altogether a tidy piece of kit." He opens the ammunition box to reveal rows of shining, brass-cased cartridges. "Caliber is.338 Lapua Magnum. High power. Send one of these your target's way and he's a mess. So, Charlie, what would you normally take into account when lining up a five-hundred-meter-plus shot?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Wind is also a factor. A strong crosswind will take a bullet off-course laterally, and a headwind will add drag. Cold air is denser than hot air, so that increases drag as well."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Right."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Righto then." Ginge twinkles at me. I'm guessing that as a Special Forces sniper, working with Anton, he took out human targets with exactly the same merry smile on his face. "In the old days, when I was in the game, we had to calculate all of these variables and adjust our sights accordingly. Fine if time was on your side, but awkward if it wasn't. Today we've got a laser system that makes all these calculations automatically. You just look through the scope, and there's your corrected aiming point."</div>

<div class="line_en">I've never thought of them as a particularly dextrous person, but watching Charlie calmly set the rifle on its bipod, fit their face to the cheekpiece, check the scope and work the bolt, I know immediately that I'm watching someone who's very, very good at what they do. As I watch, the weapon becomes an extension of their body.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Eve, you get a lovely piece of kit too." Ginge opens the waterproof rucksack and takes out an object like a truncated telescope.

<div class="line_en">As Charlie and I rehearse the spoken procedure, Ginge sets up the targets. In the rucksack there's a box of yellow party balloons, a ball of twine, scissors, a bag of small plumb-weights, and an air canister. Ginge inflates a balloon, ties it off with a length of twine, attaches a weight and slings the whole thing off the edge of the platform. A minute later it drifts into view, blown by the wind toward the buoy. Ginge, meanwhile, is preparing the next balloon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I let the first one drift for about a hundred meters, then pick it up in the spotter scope. The waves are not high, perhaps half a meter, but the rise and fall of the water is quite enough to make the balloon a hard target. At moments it disappears altogether. Beside me Charlie seems to draw into themself, and becomes almost preternaturally still. Cheek to cheekpiece, eye to eyepiece, finger to trigger.</div>

<div class="line_en">We continue to pop them, nevertheless, and so do Oxana and Anton. Ginge starts counting off our hits against theirs, yellow against pink, but there's really nothing in it. At midday we make our way to the canteen for tea and microwaved shepherd's pie, which we eat with plastic spoons. Oxana doesn't speak to me at lunch, or even look in my direction. Instead she hunkers down in her chair next to Anton, eating swiftly and in glowering silence. Nobby and Ginge sit together with their backs to me, comparing notes in an audible undertone. "Yours might be more of a natural marksman," Ginge murmurs. "But long-term I'd back mine. She's --"</div>

Am I training to take part in a political assassination for the Twelve, or working as an undercover agent for Tikhomirov and the FSB? My compass is spinning.

<div class="line_en">That night, as Nobby and Ginge exchange banter over the food preparation -- impossible to call it cooking -- and Oxana and I studiously ignore each other, Anton informs us that it's Christmas Day. Pulling a liter bottle of brandy and six paper cups from a locker, he pours a large shot into each and hands them out.</div>

<div class="line_en">We look at each other awkwardly. Oxana bolts her brandy straight down and holds out her cup for more, which Anton hesitantly gives her. She knocks that back too, and retreats into sullen silence.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ginge, Charlie and I return to the firing point, and continue until dark. The wind gets angrier as the light goes, and the desolation of the place seeps into my soul, or what's left of it. Charlie, meanwhile, is calm, patiently sending bullets to targets as I call the shots. I learn how to choose the moment to speak, how to align my breathing with Charlie's so that they're exhaling as the balloon is lifted by the swell, and squeezing off the shot as it achieves a millisecond of stillness at the peak of the wave. For all the differences between us, we're a good team.</div>

After a moment I follow her onto the unlit platform deck, where she's still flailing around, her combat clothes flattened to her body by the salt wind. I grab her, terrified she's going to go too close to the edge, and she twists violently in my arms.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The question takes me by surprise. For all Charlie's lethal proficiency, they can be almost childlike at moments. I'm about to answer when Oxana starts to dance.

<div class="line_en">I leave her there, her eyes streaming, her hair a crown of spikes around her face. Back in the container, the ping of the microwave announces that the food's ready.

And it may well be that audiences would overlook the homicide charge, the jail time, and the bizarre English accent. The problem, I suspect, would be the actual acting. Subtlety is not Charlie's forte. Witness the way that they're staring with frank, open-mouthed lust at Oxana, who's licking the last of the curry sauce from her paper plate.</div>

<div class="line_en">The next morning I wake at dawn, my anger dissipated, and make my way to the deck. Around me the sea heaves itself into blue-black peaks and furrows, marbled with foam. The sky is a soft gray, the wind sighs. At the westward end of the platform Nobby and Ginge are having a smoke, roll-ups cupped in their hands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I've grown cautiously fond of our desolate outpost. Its physical boundaries are hard and unambiguous. For as long as we're here, we're alive. In the unlikely event that we stay that way, do Oxana and I have a future together?</div>

<div class="line_en">I think that this is why she acts up so obnoxiously, demanding my attention at the same time as rejecting it. She knows that I love her, but she also knows that the usual psychopathic love narrative, the one ending in my obliteration and her savage triumph, will not play out. Instead, it seems, we're moving toward a tentative equilibrium. I know that there's a place where I can't follow her. Where she has always been alone, and always will be. I tell myself that I can live with that. That all I have to do is be patient. Be waiting there with open arms when she returns.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Most relationships with psychopaths come to an end when the psychopath knows that their latest victim has succumbed, and so is no longer of interest. That's not how it is with us. We play with the notion of Oxana as the predator and me as her prey, but that's a game, and both of us know it. Right from the start, when she first looked into my eyes as Villanelle, Oxana recognized something that it would take time for me to understand. That we were fundamentally the same, and that in consequence neither of us could ever fully possess or control the other.</div>

<div class="line_en">The whole thing is so flagrant, so bare-faced and unapologetic, that for a moment I just stand there. How have I never noticed Charlie's fingers?

<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This fragile optimism endures precisely until the moment when I walk into the canteen and see Charlie and Oxana sitting there, side by side. They have the sated, sleepy-eyed smugness of people who've been fucking all night. Charlie's fingers are splayed nonchalantly across Oxana's upper thigh, and Oxana's head is tilted proprietorially toward Charlie's.</div>

Instead, as I make the range and trace calls, my voice emptied of expression, Charlie puts round after round through the sniper rifle. Visibility is good, the sea is calm and there's almost no crosswind. I can't have done Charlie any serious damage because we're soon knocking out the balloon targets at ranges of close to a kilometer.</div>
