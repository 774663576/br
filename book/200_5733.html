<div class="line_en">Fred and George had made sure nobody was likely to forget them too soon. For one thing, they had not left instructions on how to remove the swamp that now filled the corridor on the fifth floor of the east wing. Umbridge and Filch had been observed trying different means of removing it but without success. Eventually, the area was roped off and Filch, gnashing his teeth furiously, was given the task of punting students across it to their classrooms. Harry was certain that teachers like McGonagall or Flitwick could have removed the swamp in an instant but, just as in the case of Fred and George's Wildfire Whiz-bangs, they seemed to prefer to watch Umbridge struggle.</div>

<div class="line_en">The story of Fred and George's flight to freedom was retold so often over the next few days that Harry could tell it would soon become the stuff of Hogwart's legend: within a week, even those who had been eye-witnesses were half-convinced they had seen the twins dive-bomb Umbridge on their brooms and pelt her with Dungbombs before zooming out of the doors. In the immediate aftermath of their departure there was a great wave of talk about copying them. Harry frequently heard students saying things like, "Honestly, some days I just feel like jumping on my broom and leaving this place," or else, "One more lesson like that and I might just do a Weasley."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在接下来的几天里，弗雷德和乔治飞向自由的故事被复述了无数遍，哈利都敢说，这很快就要成为霍格沃茨传奇的一部分了。一周以后，连那些现场的目击者都有几分相信，他们曾经看到双胞胎骑着飞天扫帚向乌姆里奇俯冲过去，朝她投掷了几颗大粪弹，接着急速飞出了大门。他们俩离去的直接后果就是，打算仿效他们的言论高涨了起来。哈利常常听到学生们说起这样的话：“说真的，有时候我真想跳上自己的飞天扫帚离开这个鬼地方。”或者是，“再多上一节这样的课，我可能就要当一回韦斯莱了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Inspired by Fred and George's example, a great number of students were now vying for the newly vacant positions of Troublemakers-in-Chief. In spite of the new door, somebody managed to slip a hairy-snouted Niffler into Umbridge's office, which promptly tore the place apart in its search for shiny objects, leapt on Umbridge when she entered and tried to gnaw the rings off her stubby fingers. Dungbombs and Stink Pellets were dropped so frequently in the corridors that it became the new fashion for students to perform Bubble-Head Charms on themselves before leaving lessons, which ensured them a supply of fresh air, even though it gave them all the peculiar appearance of wearing upside-down goldfish bowls on their heads.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在弗雷德和乔治这两个榜样的鼓舞下，眼下一大批学生正在激烈竞争新近空缺出来的捣蛋大王的位子。尽管换上了新门，可还是有人设法把一只长着毛茸茸长鼻子的嗅嗅偷偷塞进了乌姆里奇的办公室。它立刻把办公室里弄得一团糟，寻找闪闪发亮的东西，还跳到乌姆里奇身上，想咬下她短粗手指上的几枚戒指。大粪弹和臭弹接二连三地被扔进走廊，结果下课后给自己念泡头咒成了学生们的新时尚，这么做能确保供给他们自己新鲜空气，不过也让他们显得怪头怪脑的，就像在脑袋上倒扣了一只金鱼缸。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then there were the two large broom-shaped holes in Umbridge's office door, through which Fred and George's Cleansweeps had smashed to rejoin their masters. Filch fitted a new door and removed Harry's Firebolt to the dungeons where, it was rumoured, Umbridge had set an armed security troll to guard it. However, her troubles were far from over.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其次就是乌姆里奇办公室门上那两个飞天扫帚形的大洞，那是弗雷德和乔治的横扫赶去和主人重逢时撞出来的。费尔奇给她装上了一扇新门，还把哈利的火弩箭搬进了地下室，有传言说，乌姆里奇安置了一个携带武装的巨怪保安在看守火弩箭。不过，她的麻烦还远远没有结束呢。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Filch prowled the corridors with a horsewhip ready in his hands, desperate to catch miscreants, but the problem was that there were now so many of them he never knew which way to turn. The Inquisitorial Squad was attempting to help him, but odd things kept happening to its members. Warrington of the Slytherin Quidditch team reported to the hospital wing with a horrible skin complaint that made him look as though he had been coated in cornflakes; Pansy Parkinson, to Hermione's delight, missed all her lessons the following day as she had sprouted antlers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="费尔奇手中拎着马鞭，在走廊里到处转悠，急盼着抓到那些捣蛋鬼，可问题是，眼下这种人太多了，他根本不知道该朝哪个方向去找。调查行动小组想帮帮他，可他们的成员总是出些怪事。据说斯莱特林魁地奇球队的沃林顿进了学校医院，他得了一种可怕的皮肤病，看起来就像身上长满了一层玉米片。让赫敏高兴的是，接下来的几天里潘西帕金森长出了鹿角，错过了所有的课程。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Meanwhile, it became clear just how many Skiving Snackboxes Fred and George had managed to sell before leaving Hogwarts. Umbridge only had to enter her classroom for the students assembled there to faint, vomit, develop dangerous fevers or else spout blood from both nostrils. Shrieking with rage and frustration, she attempted to trace the mysterious symptoms to their source, but the students told her stubbornly they were suffering from "Umbridge -- itis'. After putting four successive classes in detention and failing to discover their secret, she was forced to give up and allow the bleeding, swooning, sweating and vomiting students to leave her classes in droves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在，可以很清楚地看出来弗雷德和乔治在离开霍格沃茨之前究竟卖出了多少速效逃课糖。乌姆里奇刚刚进入自己的教室，里面的学生就全都开始昏倒、呕吐、发起严重的高烧，或者从两个鼻孔里喷出鼻血。她气急败坏地尖叫着，想追查这些神秘病症的根源，但是学生们坚持对她说自己是得了“乌姆里奇综合病”。在一连关了四个班的禁闭，可还是不能发现他们的秘密之后，她只好认输，允许那些流血、昏倒和呕吐的学生成群结队地离开她的教室。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But not even the users of the Snackboxes could compete with that master of chaos, Peeves, who seemed to have taken Fred's parting words deeply to heart. Cackling madly, he soared through the school, upending tables, bursting out of blackboards, toppling statues and vases; twice he shut Mrs. Norris inside a suit of armour, from which she was rescued, yowling loudly, by the furious caretaker. Peeves smashed lanterns and snuffed out candles, juggled burning torches over the heads of screaming students, caused neatly stacked piles of parchment to topple into fires or out of windows; flooded the second floor when he pulled off all the taps in the bathrooms, dropped a bag of tarantulas in the middle of the Great Hall during breakfast and, whenever he fancied a break, spent hours at a time floating along after Umbridge and blowing loud raspberries every time she spoke.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可即便是那些使用逃课糖的学生，也无法和捣乱大师皮皮鬼相提并论，他好像把弗雷德的临别赠言深深记在了心里。他尖声狂笑着，飞过学校，掀翻桌子，突然从黑板里冲出来，推倒雕像和花瓶；有两回，他把洛丽丝夫人关进了一副盔甲，当狂怒的管理员把它救出来时，它还在大声号叫。皮皮鬼打碎灯笼，熄灭蜡烛，在尖叫着的学生头顶用正在燃烧的火把玩杂耍，把一堆堆码放整齐的羊皮纸推进炉火或者扔出窗外；他还拔掉了盥洗室里所有的水龙头，让整个三楼都泡了汤，在早饭时间朝礼堂中央扔了一包狼蛛。每当他想暂停一下的时候，他就会花上几个小时紧跟在乌姆里奇身后，只要她一开口他就大声发出嘲笑声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">None of the staff but Filch seemed to be stirring themselves to help her. Indeed, a week after Fred and George's departure Harry witnessed Professor McGonagall walking right past Peeves, who was determinedly loosening a crystal chandelier, and could have sworn he heard her tell the poltergeist out of the corner of her mouth, "It unscrews the other way."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="除了费尔奇以外，在教职员工里好像没有谁肯积极帮助乌姆里奇。其实，在弗雷德和乔治离开一个星期后，哈利亲眼看到麦格教授正好从皮皮鬼旁边走过，当时皮皮鬼正决心拧松一盏枝形水晶吊灯，哈利可以发誓，他自己亲耳听到麦格教授从嘴角对喜欢恶作剧的皮皮鬼说：“应该往另一边拧。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="最妙的事情是，蒙太自从在马桶里待了一阵以后，始终没有恢复正常；他还是糊里糊涂、不知所措，在星期二的上午，有人看到他父母正迈上城堡前的大道，表情非常生气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Should we say something?" said Hermione in a worried voice, pressing her cheek against the Charms window so that she could see Mr. and Mrs. Montague marching inside. "About what happened to him? In case it helps Madam Pomfrey cure him?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们是不是应该说一说？”赫敏担忧地说，把脸颊贴紧在魔咒课教室的窗户上，以便看到蒙太夫妇大步走进城堡里面，“说说他发生了什么事？万一这样能帮助庞弗雷夫人治好他呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“当妈妈的下一封信最终通过乌姆里奇的审查程序时，”罗恩苦恼地说，托起了自己的茶杯，它那双纤弱的腿已经没力气支撑自己的重量了，“我的麻烦就大了。要是她又寄来一封吼叫信的话，我一点儿都不会觉得奇怪。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你？”她一边说一边抓住了自己的茶杯，把它重新摆在自己面前，刚才它正迈开四条健壮的带着柳树图案的细腿，乐颠颠地横跑过桌子，“我为什么应该为你担心啊？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Because --" Harry hesitated, but the moment to confess finally seemed to have come. There was no good to be gained in keeping silent if it meant anyone suspected that Fred and George were criminals. "Because they got the gold from me. I gave them my Triwizard winnings last June."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“因为——”哈利犹豫了一下，也许是时候该坦白出来了，要是让人怀疑弗雷德和乔治犯了法，那么再沉默下去可就不是件好事了，“因为他们从我这里拿到了金子。我把去年六月三强争霸赛的奖金给他们了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“他没有。”哈利简短地说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, yes, that occurred to me, too," said Hermione, allowing her teacup to jog in neat little circles around Harry's, whose stubby little legs were still unable to touch the desktop, "I've been wondering whether Mundungus has persuaded them to sell stolen goods or something awful."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对，是啊，这倒是提醒了我，”赫敏说着让自己的茶杯绕着哈利的茶杯一小圈一小圈有规则地慢跑起来，哈利的茶杯短粗的小腿还是够不着桌面，“我一直怀疑蒙顿格斯可能在说服他们卖掉偷来的货物，或者是别的什么糟糕的东西。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yeah, but that's another thing, how did they get premises?" said Ron, hitting his teacup so hard with his wand that its legs collapsed again and it lay twitching before him. "It's a bit dodgy, isn't it? They'll need loads of Galleons to afford the rent on a place in Diagon Alley. She'll want to know what they've been up to, to get their hands on that sort of gold."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊，可是话又说回来，他们是怎么弄到门面的？”罗恩说着用力地敲打自己的茶杯，结果它两腿又一瘫躺在他面前抽搐着。“这有点儿奇怪，是不是？他们需要成堆的加隆才付得起对角巷那种地方的租金。我妈妈肯定想知道他们干了些什么才把那么多钱弄到手的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The problem was that with just under a month to go until the exams and every free moment devoted to revision, his mind seemed so saturated with information when he went to bed he found it very difficult to get to sleep at all; and when he did, his overwrought brain presented him most nights with stupid dreams about the exams.

<div class="line_en">It was a great struggle to keep up with Hagrid, what with branches and thickets of thorn through which Hagrid marched as easily as if they were cobwebs, but which snagged Harry and Hermione's robes, frequently entangling them so severely that they had to stop for minutes at a time to free themselves. Harry's arms and legs were soon covered in small cuts and scratches. They were so deep in the Forest now that sometimes all Harry could see of Hagrid in the gloom was a massive dark shape ahead of him. Any sound seemed threatening in the muffled silence. The breaking of a twig echoed loudly and the tiniest rustle of movement, even though it might have been made by an innocent sparrow, caused Harry to peer through the gloom for a culprit. It occurred to him that he had never managed to get this far into the Forest without meeting some kind of creature; their absence struck him as rather ominous.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="跟上海格非常费力，海格穿过那些树枝和灌木丛时，轻松得就像在穿过蜘蛛网，但是它们却拄住了哈利和赫敏的长袍，老是把他们缠得紧紧的，他们只得停下来几分钟，好让自己解脱出来。才一会儿工夫，哈利的手臂和腿上就布满了细小的口子和划痕。现在他们已经深入禁林，有时哈利在阴暗中只能看到前面海格巨大的黑色身影。在一片寂静的笼罩下，任何声音好像都会带来危险。一根细树枝折断的声音回响着，还有什么东西移动时发生了轻微的沙沙声，尽管那也许是一只不会带来任何伤害的麻雀发出的，也会使哈利在黑暗中仔细张望，看看是不是有什么坏人。这使他想到，自己从来没有这样深入禁林后，还看不到任何动物；它们的消失突然使他产生了不祥的感觉。">查看中文翻译</div>

Unlike Hagrid, who simply looked like an oversized human, Grawp looked strangely misshapen. What Harry had taken to be a vast mossy boulder to the left of the great earthen mound he now recognised as Grawp's head. It was much larger in proportion to the body than a human head, and was almost perfectly round and covered with tightly curling, close-growing hair the colour of bracken. The rim of a single large, fleshy ear was visible on top of the head, which seemed to sit, rather like Uncle Vernon's, directly upon the shoulders with little or no neck in between. The back, under what looked like a dirty brownish smock comprised of animal skins sewn roughly together, was very broad; and as Grawp slept, it seemed to strain a little at the rough seams of the skins. The legs were curled up under the body. Harry could see the soles of enormous, filthy, bare feet, large as sledges, resting one on top of the other on the earthy Forest floor.</div>

<div class="line_en">The giant gave a roar that echoed around the silent Forest; birds in the treetops overhead rose twittering from their perches and soared away. In front of Harry and Hermione, meanwhile, the gigantic Grawp was rising from the ground, which shuddered as he placed an enormous hand upon it to push himself on to his knees. He turned his head to see who and what had disturbed him.</div>

<div class="line_en">But Hagrid had already stepped over the great tree trunk in front of them and was proceeding towards Grawp.

<div class="line_cn" title="可是海格已经跨过他们面前粗大的树干，走近格洛普。离格洛普大约十英尺远时，他从地上捡起了一根被折断的大树枝，他回头朝哈利和赫敏笑了笑让他们安心，然后用大树枝尖端用力捅了捅格洛普后背的正中问。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry and Hermione retreated as far as they could while still keeping the giant within their sights. Grawp knelt between two trees he had not yet uprooted. They looked up into his startlingly huge face that resembled a grey full moon swimming in the gloom of the clearing. It was as though the features had been hewn on to a great stone ball. The nose was stubby and shapeless, the mouth lopsided and full of misshapen yellow teeth the size of half-bricks; the eyes, small by giant standards, were a muddy greenish-brown and just now were half-gummed together with sleep. Grawp raised dirty knuckles, each as big as a cricket ball, to his eyes, rubbed vigorously, then, without warning, pushed himself to his feet with surprising speed and agility.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利和赫敏尽量往后退，同时仍然使巨人保持在自己的视野里。格洛普跪在两棵还没有被他连根拔掉的树之问。他们俩抬起头，望着他大得惊人的脸盘，那就像是浮现在阴暗的空地上的一轮灰白色的满月。他的五官就像是在一个大石头圆球上粗粗劈凿出来的。短粗的鼻子几乎不成形状，嘴巴歪斜着，长满了半块砖头大小的奇形怪状的黄色牙齿；双眼是浑浊的褐绿色，按巨人的标准来看很小，而且因为刚刚睡醒，所以几乎还没睁开。格洛普抬起肮脏的指关节，每个都有板球那么大，伸向眼睛使劲揉了揉，然后，没有任何预兆地用惊人的速度敏捷地站了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The trees to which the other ends of the ropes around Grawp's wrists and ankles were attached creaked ominously. He was, as Hagrid had said, at least sixteen feet tall. Gazing blearily around, Grawp reached out a hand the size of a beach umbrella, seized a bird's nest from the upper branches of a towering pine and turned it upside-down with a roar of apparent displeasure that there was no bird in it; eggs fell like grenades towards the ground and Hagrid threw his arms over his head to protect himself.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I reckon it's over, yeh know!" said Hagrid, still squinting towards the stadium. "Look -- there's people coming out already -- if yeh two hurry yeh'll be able ter blend in with the crowd and no one'll know yeh weren't there!"</div>

<div class="line_en">"I don't know," said Hermione miserably. Harry saw that she looked much the worse for wear; her hair was full of twigs and leaves, her robes were ripped in several places and there were numerous scratches on her face and arms. He knew he must look little better.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不知道。”赫敏难过地说。哈利看到她显得衣衫凌乱，头发里满是小枝条和树叶，长袍被扯破了几个地方，脸上和胳膊上有许多划痕。哈利知道自己看起来肯定也好不到哪儿去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Was that another goal?" asked Hagrid, pausing in the shelter of the trees as the Quidditch stadium came into view. "Or d'yeh reckon the match is over?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"We haven't got to do anything yet!" Harry tried to reassure her in a quiet voice, as they joined a stream of jabbering Hufflepuffs heading back towards the castle. "He's not asking us to do anything unless he gets chucked out and that might not even happen."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们还什么事情都没做呢！”哈利想用沉着的语气让她安下心来，这时候他们与一群叽叽喳喳叫着的赫奇帕奇们会合在一起，朝城堡走去，“除非他被赶走了，不然他不会要求我们做任何事情，也许他根本就不会被赶走。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，别胡扯了，哈利！”赫敏生气地说，她突然原地停了下来，后面的人只好绕开她走，“他当然会被赶走，说实话，在我们刚才看到那一切之后，谁还能指责乌姆里奇呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They beamed up at him as he passed. There was a scrum at the door of the castle and Ron's head got rather badly bumped on the lintel, but nobody seemed to want to put him down. Still singing, the crowd squeezed itself into the Entrance Hall and out of sight. Harry and Hermione watched them go, beaming, until the last echoing strains of 'Weasley is our King' died away. Then they turned to each other, their smiles fading.</div>

<div class="line_en">They climbed the steps together. At the front doors both instinctively looked back at the Forbidden Forest.
