<div class="line_en">Mrs. John Dashwood now installed herself mistress of Norland; and her mother and sisters-in-law were degraded to the condition of visitors. As such, however, they were treated by her with quiet civility; and by her husband with as much kindness as he could feel towards anybody beyond himself, his wife, and their child. He really pressed them, with some earnestness, to consider Norland as their home; and, as no plan appeared so eligible to Mrs. Dashwood as remaining there till she could accommodate herself with a house in the neighbourhood, his invitation was accepted.</div>

<div class="line_en">A continuance in a place where everything reminded her of former delight, was exactly what suited her mind. In seasons of cheerfulness, no temper could be more cheerful than hers, or possess, in a greater degree, that sanguine expectation of happiness which is happiness itself. But in sorrow she must be equally carried away by her fancy, and as far beyond consolation as in pleasure she was beyond alloy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对于达什伍德太太来说，呆在个老地方，随时随地都能回想起昔日的欢乐，倒也再称心不过了。碰到高兴的时候，谁也没有她那样开心，那样乐观地期待着幸福的到来，仿佛期待本身就是一种幸福似的。可是一遇到伤心事，她也同样胡思乱想，失去常态，同她高兴时不能自己一样，她伤心起来也是无法解脱的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mrs. John Dashwood did not at all approve of what her husband intended to do for his sisters. To take three thousand pounds from the fortune of their dear little boy would be impoverishing him to the most dreadful degree. She begged him to think again on the subject. How could he answer it to himself to rob his child, and his only child too, of so large a sum? And what possible claim could the Miss Dashwoods, who were related to him only by half blood, which she considered as no relationship at all, have on his generosity to so large an amount. It was very well known that no affection was ever supposed to exist between the children of any man by different marriages; and why was he to ruin himself, and their poor little Harry, by giving away all his money to his half sisters?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="约翰。达什伍德夫人根本不赞成丈夫资助他几个妹妹，从他们小宝贝的财产中挖掉三千镑，岂不是把他刮成穷光蛋了吗？她请丈夫重新考虑这件事。自己的孩子，而且是独生子，他怎么忍心剥夺他这么一大笔钱呀？几位达什伍德小姐与他只是同父异母兄妹，她认为这根本算不上什么亲属关系，她们有什么权利领受他这样慷慨的资助？人所周知，同父异母子女之间历来不存在什么感情，可他为什么偏要把自己的钱财送给同父异母妹妹，毁自已，也毁他们可怜的小哈里？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"He did not stipulate for any particular sum, my dear Fanny; he only requested me, in general terms, to assist them, and make their situation more comfortable than it was in his power to do. Perhaps it would have been as well if he had left it wholly to myself. He could hardly suppose I should neglect them. But as he required the promise, I could not do less than give it; at least I thought so at the time. The promise, therefore, was given, and must be performed. Something must be done for them whenever they leave Norland and settle in a new home."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“亲爱的范妮，他倒没有规定具体数目，只是笼统地要求我帮助她们，使她们的境况好一些，他是无能为力啦。也许他不如索性把事情全部交给我。他总不会认为我会怠慢她们吧。可他让我许诺时，我又不能不应承；起码在当时，我是这么想的。于是，我许诺了，而且还必须兑现。她们早晚要离开诺兰庄园，到别处安家，总得帮她们一把吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，当然，”丈夫一本正经地说道，“那可就了不得啦。有朝一日，哈里会怨恨我们给他送掉这么一大笔钱。他一旦人丁兴旺起来，这笔款子可就派大用场了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"That is very true, and, therefore, I do not know whether, upon the whole, it would not be more advisable to do something for their mother while she lives, rather than for them-something of the annuity kind I mean. -- My sisters would feel the good effects of it as well as herself. A hundred a year would make them all perfectly comfortable."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Certainly not; but if you observe, people always live for ever when there is an annuity to be paid them; and she is very stout and healthy, and hardly forty. An annuity is a very serious business; it comes over and over every year, and there is no getting rid of it. You are not aware of what you are doing. I have known a great deal of the trouble of annuities; for my mother was clogged with the payment of three to old superannuated servants by my father's will, and it is amazing how disagreeable she found it. Twice every year these annuities were to be paid; and then there was the trouble of getting it to them; and then one of them was said to have died, and afterwards it turned out to be no such thing. My mother was quite sick of it. Her income was not her own, she said, with such perpetual claims on it; and it was the more unkind in my father, because, otherwise, the money would have been entirely at my mother's disposal, without any restriction whatever. It has given me such an abhorrence of annuities, that I am sure I would not pin myself down to the payment of one for all the world."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然活不到。不过，你留心观察一下，人要是能领到一点年金的话，总是活个没完没了。她身强力壮的，还不到四十岁。年金可不是闹着玩的，一年一年地给下去，到时想甩都甩不掉。你不懂这种事，我可体验到给年金的不少苦楚，因为我母亲遵照我父亲的遗嘱，年年要向三个老仆人支付退休金，她发现这事讨厌极了。这些退休金每年支付两次，要送到仆人手里可麻烦了。此后听说有一个仆人死了，可后来发现并没有这回事。我母亲伤透了脑筋。她说，她的财产被这样长久刮下去，她哪里还做得了主？这都怪我父亲太狠心，不然这钱还不都是我母亲的，爱怎么用就怎么用。加今，我对年金憎恶透了，要是叫我给哪个人付年金，我说什么也不干。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I believe you are right, my love; it will be better that there should be no annuity in the case; whatever I may give them occasionally will be of far greater assistance than a yearly allowance, because they would only enlarge their style of living if they felt sure of a larger income, and would not be sixpence the richer for it at the end of the year. It will certainly be much the best way. A present of fifty pounds, now and then, will prevent their ever being distressed for money, and will, I think, be amply discharging my promise to my father."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“亲爱的，我看你说得对，这事还是不搞年金为好。偶尔给她们几个钱，比给年金有益得多，因为钱给多了，她们只会变得大手大脚，到了年底。一个小钱也多不出来。这是个最好不过的办法。不定时地送她们五十镑，这样她们什么时候也不会缺钱用，我还能充分履行我对父亲的诺言。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It is certainly an unpleasant thing," replied Mr. Dashwood, "to have those kind of yearly drains on one's income. One's fortune, as your mother justly says, is not one's own. To be tied down to the regular payment of such a sum, on every rent day, is by no means desirable: it takes away one's independence."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“一个人的收入年年这样消耗下去，”达什伍德先生说，“这当然是件不偷快的事情。你母亲说得对，这财产就不由自己做主了。一到年金支付日，都要照例支出一笔钱，这着实有些讨厌：它剥夺了一个人的自主权。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Undoubtedly; and after all you have no thanks for it. They think themselves secure, you do no more than what is expected, and it raises no gratitude at all. If I were you, whatever I did should be done at my own discretion entirely. I would not bind myself to allow them any thing yearly. It may be very inconvenient some years to spare a hundred, or even fifty pounds from our own expenses."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那还用说。尽管如此，你还不讨好。她们觉得自己到期领取，万无一失，而你又不会再多给，所以对你压根儿不领情。我要是你呀，不管做什么事，一定自作裁夺。我决不会作茧自缚，去给她们什么年金。逢到某些年头，你要从自己的花销中抽声一百镑，甚至五十镑，可不那么容易。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"To be sure it will. Indeed, to say the truth, I am convinced within myself that your father had no idea of your giving them any money at all. The assistance he thought of, I dare say, was only such as might be reasonably expected of you; for instance, such as looking out for a comfortable small house for them, helping them to move their things, and sending them presents of fish and game, and so forth, whenever they are in season. I'll lay my life that he meant nothing farther; indeed, it would be very strange and unreasonable if he did. Do but consider, my dear Mr. Dashwood, how excessively comfortable your mother-in-law and her daughters may live on the interest of seven thousand pounds, besides the thousand pounds belonging to each of the girls, which brings them in fifty pounds a year a-piece, and, of course, they will pay their mother for their board out of it. Altogether, they will have five hundred a-year amongst them, and what on earth can four women want for more than that? -- They will live so cheap! Their housekeeping will be nothing at all. They will have no carriage, no horses, and hardly any servants; they will keep no company, and can have no expenses of any kind! Only conceive how comfortable they will be! Five hundred a year! I am sure I cannot imagine how they will spend half of it; and as to your giving them more, it is quite absurd to think of it. They will be much more able to give you something."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然如此。说实在话，我认为你父亲根本没有让你资助她们的意思。我敢说，他所谓的帮助，不过是让你合情合理地帮点忙，比方替她们找座舒适的小房子啦，帮她们搬搬东西啦，等季节到了给她们送点鲜鱼野味啦，等等。我敢以性命担保，他没有别的意思；要不然，岂不成了咄咄怪事。亲爱的达什伍德先生，你只要想一想，你继母和她的女儿们靠着那七千镑得来的利息，会过上多么舒适的日子啊。况且每个女儿还有一千镑，每年能给每人带来五十镑的收益。当然啦，她们会从中拿来向母亲缴纳伙食费的。总计起来，她们一年有五百镑的收入，就那么四个女人家，这些钱还不够吗？她们的花销少得很！管理家务不成问题。她们一无马车，二无马匹，也不用雇仆人。她们不跟外人来往，什么开支也没有！你看她们有多舒服！一年五百镑啊！我简直无法想象她们哪能花掉一半。至于说你想再给她们钱，未免太荒诞了吧，论财力，她们给你点倒差不多。”">查看中文翻译</div>
