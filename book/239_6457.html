<div class="line_en">Alice looked round quickly, and saw that it was the Red Queen. "She's grown a lot," Alice thought. When she had seen her by the fireplace, the Queen had been only eight centimetres high. Now she was taller than Alice herself!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱丽丝马上看了看周围，原来是红方王后。她想：“她长大了不少。”那次在壁炉边看见王后时，她只有8厘米高，而今竟比爱丽丝还高些。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This sounded nonsense to Alice, so she began to walk towards the Red Queen. To her surprise, she found herself a minute later walking in through the front door of the house. She turned round crossly, and saw the Queen again, on the other side of the garden. This time she tried walking the other way, away from the Queen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在爱丽丝听来，这似乎是无稽之谈，于是她开始朝红方王后走过去。令她惊讶的是，一分钟后，她发现自己又踏进那幢房子的正门。她气恼地转过身来，又瞧见王后在花园的另一头。这次，她试着走另一条路，远离王后。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You can't possibly do that," said the Rose. "You must walk the other way if you want to meet her."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Where do you come from?" said the Red Queen. "Where are you going? And why are you here at all? Look up, speak nicely, keep your hands still. And curtsy while you're thinking what to say. It saves time."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="红方王后问：“你从哪里来？要到哪里去？你来这儿究竟干什么？讲话要抬头，要有礼貌，手要放好。在考虑下一句该讲什么时，要行屈膝礼。这样会节省时间。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I only wanted to look at the garden, your Majesty, from the top of that hill," she began.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她开了言：“王后陛下，我只是想站在山顶看看底下的花园。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But a hill can't be a valley," said Alice."That would be nonsense."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱丽丝应了声：“但山决不会是峡谷。这是无稽之谈。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Hill!" cried the Queen. "Some people would call that a valley."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“山！有人称那为峡谷。”王后高喊了一句。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's just like a large chess-board!" Alice said at last. "Oh, and I can see some chessmen down there!" Her heart began to beat fast with excitement. "It's a great game of chess, as big as the world itself -- if this is the world at all. Oh, what fun! I wish I could be in it, even as a Pawn. Although I would love to be a Queen, of course."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱丽丝最后说：“多像一个大棋盘！啊，我还看见了那儿站着些棋子哪！”她激动得心蹦蹦直跳，“这是一场大型的象棋游戏。如果世界就在我们眼前，那么它就跟整个世界一样大。啊，多有趣！真希望我能在那里面，做一个小卒也行。当然，我更喜欢当一个王后。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Red Queen shook her head. "You can call it nonsense if you like. Some people would say it was sensible!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="王后摇了摇头，“你可以把这种讲法称作无稽之谈，但有人却认为很有道理。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Alice curtsied again, and decided it would be safer not to argue any more. Together, they walked on in silence up the hill. At the top Alice could see right across the country -- and a very strange country it was. There were lots of little brooks running across from side to side, and there were long lines of hedges, going the other way. It was a country of squares.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱丽丝又行了一个礼，拿定主意还是别争辩的好。他们双双一言不发地上了山。从山顶，爱丽丝可以俯瞰整个原野，这真是片奇特的原野。有条条小溪与排排的小树林，在其间纵横交错。整个原野被分割成一个个方块格子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She looked a little worriedly at the real Queen as she said this. But the Red Queen smiled kindly, and said, "You can be the White Queen's Pawn, if you like. Lily is too young to play. You're in the Second Square now, and when you get to the Eighth Square, you'll be a Queen --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="讲到这里，她有点不安地看了眼真正的王后。可是，红方王后好心地微笑着说：“如果你愿意，你可以做白方王后前面的卒子。百合太小，玩不了棋。现在你站在第二格，当你走到第八格时，就升变为王后了——”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Faster! Faster!" cried the Queen, pulling Alice's hand. They ran like the wind, but the strange thing was that they never seemed to pass anything. The trees and other things round them never changed their places at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="王后拉着爱丽丝的手，叫喊着：“跑快点！快点！”她们像一阵风似地跑过，但奇怪的是，她们似乎从未把什么景物甩在后面。两边的树木及周围其他物体根本没有改变位置。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's polite," said the Queen, "to say thank you for all this information. But never mind. Let's pretend you said it. The Seventh Square is all forest -- one of the Knights will show you the way-and in the Eighth Square we shall be Queens together, and it's all parties and fun!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="王后说：“告诉你这么多详情，道声感谢就显得礼貌。不过没关系。就当你讲过了吧。第七格全是森林——一枚马将做你的向导——到了第八格，我们就都是王后了，那时我们有享受不完的欢乐时光！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What a slow kind of country!" said the Queen. "Here, you see, you have to run very fast, just to keep in the same place. If you want to go somewhere different, you must run twice as fast. Now," she went on, "I shall tell you what to do. While I'm speaking, I shall take five steps, and at the fifth step, I shall go."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="王后却说：“你那地方可真‘慢’！在我们这儿，要保持原地不动，你得跑得飞快。如果你要到别处去，至少得跑刚才两倍的速度。”她又接着说：“我这就告诉你怎么个走法。在我讲话的同时，我将迈出五步，到了第五步，我就走了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She took two steps away from the tree and turned round. "A pawn goes two squares in its first move. So you'll go very quickly through the Third Square -- by railway, probably.
