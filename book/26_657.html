<div class="line_en">The postbag, that evening -- it came late -- contained a letter for me, which, however, in the hand of my employer, I found to be composed but of a few words enclosing another, addressed to himself, with a seal still unbroken.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天晚上，有个邮包到了，它来得晚了些，里面有我的信，却是我雇主写给我的，打开后发现只有几行字，还附了另一封邮给他的信，尚未打开。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"This, I recognize, is from the headmaster, and the headmaster's an awful bore. Read him, please; deal with him; but mind you don't report. Not a word. I'm off!" I broke the seal with a great effort -- so great a one that I was a long time coming to it; took the unopened missive at last up to my room and only attacked it just before going to bed. I had better have let it wait till morning, for it gave me a second sleepless night.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我认出这是校长写来的信，他是个可怕的傻瓜。读他的信，应付下他，但请记住不要跟我汇报。一个字也不行。我不在！”我拆封条拆得颇为费劲，过了好长时间才缓过劲来。我最后拿着这封未打开的信走到我的房间，在睡前才开始读它。我真应该等到早上再读这封信，因为它给我带来了第二个不眠之夜。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The first day had been, on the whole, as I have expressed, reassuring; but I was to see it wind up in keen apprehension.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mrs. Grose listened with dumb emotion; she forbore to ask me what this meaning might be; so that, presently, to put the thing with some coherence and with the mere aid of her presence to my own mind, I went on: "That he's an injury to the others."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="格罗斯太太沉默不语，只是听着，她忍耐着不问我这到底意味着什么。所以后来，我把事情理了下头绪，而她在这里就是对我唯一的帮助，我继续道：“他对别人是一种伤害。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I found myself, to meet my friend the better, offering it, on the spot, sarcastically. "To his poor little innocent mates!"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes, yes; it would be incredible." She was evidently grateful for such a profession.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊，是啊，简直令人无法相信。”显而易见，她对我的这句话流露出感激的神色。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"See him, miss, first. THEN believe it!" I felt forthwith a new impatience to see him; it was the beginning of a curiosity that, for all the next hours, was to deepen almost to pain. Mrs. Grose was aware, I could judge, of what she had produced in me, and she followed it up with assurance. "You might as well believe it of the little lady. Bless her!" she added the next moment --"LOOK at her!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“小姐，先见一下他。然后你就会相信的。”我立刻又有一种迫不及待想见到他的心情。一开始只是好奇，在接下来的时间，这感觉加深到几乎成为一种痛苦。我可以看出，格罗斯太太意识到了她所说的话影响到了我，她接着很肯定地说：“你也可以相信那位年轻女士的话。上帝保佑她！”紧接着她加了句，“瞧她！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Nonetheless, the rest of the day I watched for further occasion to approach my colleague, especially as, toward evening, I began to fancy she rather sought to avoid me. I overtook her, I remember, on the staircase; we went down together, and at the bottom I detained her, holding her there with a hand on her arm.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管如此，在那天余下的时间里，我都想进一步找机会接近我的同事格罗斯太太。尤其是快到晚上时，我开始猜想到她是故意躲着我。我记得在楼梯上我追上了她，我们一起朝楼下走着。在楼下我留住了她，伸出一只手抓住了她的胳膊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I take what you said to me at noon as a declaration that YOU'VE never known him to be bad." She threw back her head; she had clearly, by this time, and very honestly, adopted an attitude. "Oh, never known him -- I don't pretend THAT!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你中午对我说的话让我觉得，你从来都不知道他是个坏孩子。”她转过头，这回，她以很清晰、坦诚的态度说道：“哦，我从不知道——也从不假装那样！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I needed nothing more than this to feel the full force of Mrs. Grose's comparison, and, catching my pupil in my arms, covered her with kisses in which there was a sob of atonement.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这使我强烈体会到了格罗斯太太的比较显现出来的强大威力。我抱起我的学生，吻着她，内疚地哽咽着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I turned and saw that Flora, whom, ten minutes before, I had established in the schoolroom with a sheet of white paper, a pencil, and a copy of nice 'round o's," now presented herself to view at the open door. She expressed in her little way an extraordinary detachment from disagreeable duties, looking to me, however, with a great childish light that seemed to offer it as a mere result of the affection she had conceived for my person, which had rendered necessary that she should follow me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我转身看到了弗洛拉，现在，她就站在开着的门口。十分钟前，我让她在教室里，给了她一张白纸和一支铅笔，让她临摹书上那个漂亮的、圆圆的字母O。她用她自己的方式从这个无趣的任务中分心跑出来，然而她用稚气的目光注视着我，好像在说这仅仅因为她对我本人的喜爱，所以提出必须跟着我才对。">查看中文翻译</div>
