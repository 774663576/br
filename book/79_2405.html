<div class="line_en">And he didn't know the right words to express the creeping, lassitudinous sense of terror he had felt when he heard the dead aspen leaves begin to crackle furtively down there in the cold darkness. But he told them about the soft sound of snow falling in clumps. About the lion with its head and its bunched shoulders working its way up and out of the snow to chase him. He even told them about how the rabbit had turned its head to watch near the end.</div>

<div class="line_en">The three of them were in the lobby. Jack had built a roaring blaze in the fireplace. Danny was bundled up in a blanket on the small sofa where once, a million years ago, three nuns had sat laughing like girls while they waited for the line at the desk to thin out. He was sipping hot noodle soup from a mug.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们坐在门厅里。杰克把壁炉烧得旺旺的。丹尼裹在一床毛毯里，坐在那张小沙发上，曾经，仿佛在100万年前，有三个修女坐在这张沙发上，等着排得长长的队伍变短，当时她们笑得跟小姑娘似的。他端着大杯子喝着热面条汤。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="期间有两次，他从后裤袋抽出手帕揩他那看上去微微发肿的嘴唇。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And he thought he could do that, but he couldn't stop shaking. He looked into the fire and waited for Daddy to say something. High yellow flames danced on the dark stone hearth. A pine-knot exploded with a bang and sparks rushed up the flue.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他相信自己能做到这一点，但他还是忍不住要发抖。他盯着火，等爸爸开口说话。高高的橙黄色火苗在黑色的石头砌成的火炉里跃动着。一个松节疤砰地一声炸开了，火星子顺着烟道腾了上去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Then they chased me," he finished. Jack got up and went over to the window, his back to them. He looked at his mommy. "They chased me all the way up to the porch." He was struggling to keep his voice calm, because if he stayed calm maybe they would believe him. Mr. Stenger hadn't stayed calm. He had started to cry and hadn't been able to stop SO THE MEN IN THE WHITE COATS had come to take him away because if you couldn't stop crying it meant you had LOST YOUR MARBLES and when would you be back? NO ONE KNOWS. His parka and snowpants and the clotted snowshoes lay on the rug just inside the big double doors.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“然后，它们开始追我，”他最后讲道。杰克站起来，走到窗前，背对着他们。丹尼看着妈妈。“一直追到门廊。”他尽量让自己的声音保持冷静，因为这样他们也许才会相信他。斯登格先生没有保持冷静，他哭了起来，而且止不住，所以“穿白大褂的”才来把他带走了，因为，如果你不能止住哭叫，那就意味着你“失去了玻璃弹子”。他们什么时候放你出来？没人知道。他的风雪衣、风雪裤和沾满积雪的雪鞋丢在刚进大门的地毯上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Danny, come over here." Jack turned around. His face still had that pinched, deathly look. Danny didn't like to look at it.</div>

<div class="line_en">Danny had known what he would see even before he got to the window. Below the clutter of boot tracks, sled tracks, and snowshoe tracks that marked their usual exercise area, the snowfield that covered the Overlook's lawns sloped down to the topiary and the playground beyond. It was marred by two sets of tracks, one of them in a straight line from the porch to the playground, the other a long, looping line coming back up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹尼还没走到窗前就知道他会看见什么了。远望饭店的草坪是他们往常活动的地方，现在是一片雪地，雪上留下了零乱的靴印、雪橇印和雪地鞋印迹。雪地延伸开去，至树篱、游戏场以及更远的地方，上面踩出了两条印迹，一条直线从门廊到游戏场，另一条长长的迂回的线路往回走。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The strangeness in his eyes seemed to break then. "I'm trying to help him find the difference between something real and something that was only an hallucination, that's all." He squatted by Danny so they were on an eye-to-eye level, and then hugged him tight. "Danny, it didn't really happen. Okay? It was like one of those trances you have sometimes. That's all."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他眼睛里的陌生神色消散了。“我想让他分清真实的东西和幻觉，仅此而已。”他在丹尼身边蹲下，这样他们的眼睛便处在同一水平线上了，然后紧紧搂抱着他。“丹尼，那些都不是真的，就像你有时候进入的恍惚状态一样。就这么回事。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then Wendy was between them, her face pale and angry. "What are you trying to make him do?" she asked him. "Confess to murder? What's wrong with you?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"I didn't cut my leg on the crust. There isn't any crust. It's all powdery snow. It won't even stick together to make snowballs. Remember we tried to have a snowball fight and couldn't?" He felt his father stiffen against him. "The porch step, then." Danny pulled away. Suddenly he had it. It had flashed into his mind all at once, the way things sometimes did, the way it had about the woman wanting to be in that gray man's pants. He stared at his father with widening eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我的腿不是在硬雪块上划破的，没有硬雪块。全是雪粉，粘不到一起去，连雪球都捏不成。记得我们想打雪仗都打不成吗？”他感觉到爸爸的身体僵硬起来了。“那么，一定是在门廊台阶上划破的。”丹尼抽出身来。突然，他捕捉到了那个信息。它一下子闪进了他脑子里，就像有的时候那样，就像那次他觉察到那个女人想进那个穿灰制服的男人的裤裆一样。他瞪大眼睛，盯着他父亲。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh please stop pulling me!" he screamed at them, and there was such agony in his voice that they both let go of him, and then the tears had to come and he collapsed, weeping, between the sofa and the window, his parents staring at him helplessly, the way children might stare at a toy broken in a furious tussle over to whom it belonged. In the fireplace another pine-knot exploded like a hand grenade, making them all jump.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，求你们别扯我！”他尖叫道，声音里充满了痛苦。他们俩放开了他，接着，他再也抑制不住泪水，呜呜哭了起来。在沙发和窗户之间，他父母手足无措地看着他，正如孩子们在一场激烈的争抢之后盯着那已经残破的玩具一样。壁炉里又有一块松节像颗手雷一样爆炸了，惊得他们跳了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

The same way he had always meant it on those mornings after, looking at his pale and haggard face in the bathroom mirror. I'm going to stop, going to cut it off flat. But morning gave way to afternoon, and in the afternoons he felt a little better. And afternoon gave way to night. As some great twentieth-century thinker had said, night must fall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好的，”杰克说，至少此时此刻他是这么想的。同样，早晨在浴室的镜子里看到自己苍白、憔悴的面容之后，他也是这样想的。我不干了，我要直截了当地离开这里。可是，到了下午，他的感觉就好一些了。到了晚上——正如某位20世纪思想家所说的那样，黑夜必将降临——他就打消了想走的念头。">查看中文翻译</div>
