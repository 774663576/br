<div class="line_en">Queer! I who was jealous of every male we met -- queer, how I misinterpreted the designations of doom. Perhaps I had been lulled by Lo's modest behavior in winter, and anyway it would have been too foolish even for a lunatic to suppose another Humbert was avidly following Humbert and Humbert's nymphet with Jovian fireworks, over the great and ugly plains. I surmised, donc, that the Red Yak keeping behind us at a discreet distance mile after mile was operated by a detective whom some busybody had hired to see what exactly Humbert Humbert was doing with that minor stepdaughter of his. As happens with me at periods of electrical disturbance and crepitating lightnings, I had hallucinations. Maybe they were more than hallucinations. I do not know what she or he, or both had put into my liquor but one night I felt sure somebody was tapping on the door of our cabin, and I flung it open, and noticed two things -- that I was stark naked and that, white-glistening in the rain-dripping darkness, there stood a man holding before his face the mask of Jutting Chin, a grotesque sleuth in the funnies. He emitted a muffled guffaw and scurried away, and I reeled back into the room, and fell asleep again, and am not sure even to this day that the visit was not a drug-provoked dream: I have thoroughly studied Trapp's type of humor, and this might have been a plausible sample. Oh, crude and absolutely ruthless! Somebody, I imagined, was making money on those masks of popular monsters and morons. Did I see next morning two urchins rummaging in a garbage can and trying on Jutting Chin? I wonder. It may all have been a coincidence -- due to atmospheric conditions, I suppose.</div>

The following days were marked by a number of great thunderstorms -- or perhaps, there was but one single storm which progressed across country in ponderous frog-leaps and which we could not shake off just as we could not shake off detective Trapp: for it was during those days that the problem of the Aztec Red Convertible presented itself to me, and quite overshadowed the theme of Lo's lovers.</div>

<div class="line_en">Being a murderer with a sensational but incomplete and unorthodox memory, I cannot tell you, ladies and gentlemen, the exact day when I first knew with utter certainty that the red convertible was following us. I do remember, however, the first time I saw its driver quite clearly. I was proceeding slowly one afternoon through torrents of rain and kept seeing that red ghost swimming and shivering with lust in my mirror, when presently the deluge dwindled to a patter, and then was suspended altogether. With a swishing sound a sunburst swept the highway, and needing a pair of new sunglasses, I pulled up at a filling station. What was happening was a sickness, a cancer, that could not be helped, so I simply ignored the fact that our quiet pursuer, in his converted state, stopped a little behind us at a café or bar bearing the idiotic sign: The Bustle: A Deceitful Seatful. Having seen to the needs of my car, I walked into the office to get those glasses and pay for the gas.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="作为一个感觉敏锐、但无完整、系统记忆的杀人犯，女士们先生们不能告诉你们，究竟是哪一天我第一次确定那辆红色敞篷车正在尾随我们。但我确实记得，我第一次一清二楚看见车子驾驶人的那一天。有天下午我正在倾盆大雨中缓缓前进，不住盯着我照后镜中那个摇来躲去的红色幽灵，后来大雨减弱，淅淅沥沥，再后来便风停雨歇了。瑟瑟声中，太阳也挤出云隙，洒向高速公路。我需要一副新太阳镜，就停在一家供应站。那时发生的事是疾病，是癌症，叫人无能为力，因此我只能略去这一事实：即我们不声不响的追随者，也改变了主意，停在我们后边不远的一家咖啡店或酒馆边，那儿有这么个蠢招牌，巴期特尔：骗人的地方。注意到满足了我汽车的需求，我又走进屋买了太阳镜，付了汽油费。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As I was in the act of signing a traveller's check and wondered about my exact whereabouts, I happened to glance through a side window, and saw a terrible thing. A broad-backed man, baldish, in an oatmeal coat and dark-brown trousers, was listening to Lo who was leaning out of the car and talking to him very rapidly, her hand with outspread fingers going up and down as it did when she was very serious and emphatic. What struck me with sickening force was -- how should I put it?-- the voluble familiarity of her way, as if they had known each other -- oh, for weeks and weeks. I saw him scratch his cheek and nod, and turn, and walk back to his convertible, a broad and thickish man of my age, somewhat resembling Gustave Trapp, a cousin of my father's in Switzerland -- same smoothly tanned face, fuller than mine, with a small dark mustache and a rosebud degenerate mouth. Lolita was studying a road map when I got back into the car.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正在我签一张旅客支票，并疑惑自己究竟身在何处，我偶然从侧窗往外瞥了一眼，便看见了一幕可怕的景象。洛从车里探出身正急火火地对一个阔背、秃顶，穿一件灰黄色上衣和深褐色长裤的男士说着什么，还伸出一只手上上下下一通比划，只有她讲到严肃处想强调什么的时候，才这样举止。几欲将我击昏的是——我该怎么讲呢？——是她口若悬河的熟识样，好象他们早就彼此相知——唉，总有很多星期、很多星期了。我看见他挠脸，点点头，而后掉转身，又回到他的敞篷车上。这男人的肩阔胸厚，年龄与我相仿，酷象我父亲在瑞士的一位表亲古斯塔夫·特拉普——同样光滑，日光浴过的脸，比我的丰满，一小撇黑色八字胡，一张小口如衰败了的樱桃。等我回到车上，洛丽塔已在看一张公路地图。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But next day, like pain in a fatal disease that comes back as the drug and hope wear off, there it was again behind us, that glossy red beast. The traffic on the highway was light that day; nobody passed anybody; and nobody attempted to get in between our humble blue car and its imperious red shadow -- as if there were some spell cast on that interspace, a zone of evil mirth and magic, a zone whose very precision and stability had a glass-like virtue that was almost artistic. The driver behind me, with his stuffed shoulders and Trappish mustache, looked like a display dummy, and his convertible seemed to move only because an invisible rope of silent silk connected it with our shabby vehicle. We were many times weaker than his splendid, lacquered machine, so that I did not even attempt to outspeed him. O lente currite noctis equi! O softly run, nightmares! We climbed long grades and rolled downhill again, and heeded speed limits, and spared slow children, and reproduced in sweeping terms the black wiggles of curves on their yellow shields, and no matter how and where we drove, the enchanted interspace slid on intact, mathematical, mirage-like, the viatic counterpart of a magic carpet. And all the time I was aware of a private blaze on my right: her joyful eye, her flaming cheek.</div>

<div class="line_en">Oh, disaster. Some confusion had occurred, she had misread a date in the Tour Book, and the Magic Cave ceremonies were over! She took it bravely, I must admit -- and, when we discovered there was in kurortish Wace a summer theatre in full swing, we naturally drifted toward it one fair mid-June evening. I really could not tell you the plot of the play we saw. A trivial affair, no doubt, with self-conscious light effects and a mediocre leading lady. The only detail that pleased me was a garland of seven little graces, more or less immobile, prettily painted, bare-limbed -- seven bemused pubescent girls in colored gauze that had been recruited locally (judging by the partisan flurry here and there among the audience) and were supposed to represent a living rainbow, which lingered throughout the last act, and rather teasingly faded behind a series of multiplied veils. I remember thinking that this idea of children-colors had been lifted by authors Clare Quilty and Vivian Darkbloom from a passage in James Joyce, and that two of the colors were quite exasperatingly lovely -- Orange who kept fidgeting all the time, and Emerald who, when her eyes got used to the pitch-black pit where we all heavily sat, suddenly smiled at her mother or her protector.</div>

<div class="line_en">As soon as the thing was over, and manual applause -- a sound my nerves cannot stand -- began to crash all around me, I started to pull and push Lo toward the exit, in my so natural amorous impatience to get her back to our neon-blue cottage in the stunned, starry night: I always say nature is stunned by the sights she sees. Dolly-Lo, however, lagged behind, in a rosy daze, her pleased eyes narrowed, her sense of vision swamping the rest of her senses to such an extent that her limp hands hardly came together at all in the mechanical action of clapping they still went through. I had seen that kind of thing in children before but, by God, this was a special child, myopically beaming at the already remote stage where I glimpsed something of the joint authors -- a man's tuxedo and the bare shoulders of a hawk-like, black-haired, strikingly tall woman.</div>
