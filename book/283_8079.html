<div class="line_en">Mrs. Weston's friends were all made happy by her safety; and if the satisfaction of her well-doing could be increased to Emma, it was by knowing her to be the mother of a little girl. She had been decided in wishing for a Miss Weston. She would not acknowledge that it was with any view of making a match for her, hereafter, with either of Isabella's sons; but she was convinced that a daughter would suit both father and mother best. It would be a great comfort to Mr. Weston, as he grew older -- and even Mr. Weston might be growing older ten years hence -- to have his fireside enlivened by the sports and the nonsense, the freaks and the fancies of a child never banished from home; and Mrs. Weston -- no one could doubt that a daughter would be most to her; and it would be quite a pity that any one who so well knew how to teach, should not have their powers in exercise again.</div>

It was very natural for you to say, what right has he to lecture me?-- and I am afraid very natural for you to feel that it was done in a disagreeable manner. I do not believe I did you any good. The good was all to myself, by making you an object of the tenderest affection to me. I could not think about you so much without doating on you, faults and all; and by dint of fancying so many errors, have been in love with you ever since you were thirteen at least."</div>

<div class="line_en">Emma grieved that she could not be more openly just to one important service which his better sense would have rendered her, to the advice which would have saved her from the worst of all her womanly follies -- her wilful intimacy with Harriet Smith; but it was too tender a subject.-- She could not enter on it.-- Harriet was very seldom mentioned between them. This, on his side, might merely proceed from her not being thought of; but Emma was rather inclined to attribute it to delicacy, and a suspicion, from some appearances, that their friendship were declining. She was aware herself, that, parting under any other circumstances, they certainly should have corresponded more, and that her intelligence would not have rested, as it now almost wholly did, on Isabella's letters. He might observe that it was so. The pain of being obliged to practise concealment towards him, was very little inferior to the pain of having made Harriet unhappy.</div>

<div class="line_en">Isabella sent quite as good an account of her visitor as could be expected; on her first arrival she had thought her out of spirits, which appeared perfectly natural, as there was a dentist to be consulted; but, since that business had been over, she did not appear to find Harriet different from what she had known her before.-- Isabella, to be sure, was no very quick observer; yet if Harriet had not been equal to playing with the children, it would not have escaped her. Emma's comforts and hopes were most agreeably carried on, by Harriet's being to stay longer; her fortnight was likely to be a month at least. Mr. and Mrs. John Knightley were to come down in August, and she was invited to remain till they could bring her back.</div>

As soon as Mrs. Weston was sufficiently recovered to admit Mr. Woodhouse's visits, Emma having it in view that her gentle reasonings should be employed in the cause, resolved first to announce it at home, and then at Randalls.-- But how to break it to her father at last!-- She had bound herself to do it, in such an hour of Mr. Knightley's absence, or when it came to the point her heart would have failed her, and she must have put it off; but Mr. Knightley was to come at such a time, and follow up the beginning she was to make.-- She was forced to speak, and to speak cheerfully too. She must not make it a more decided subject of misery to him, by a melancholy tone herself. She must not appear to think it a misfortune.-- With all the spirits she could command, she prepared him first for something strange, and then, in a few words, said, that if his consent and approbation could be obtained -- which, she trusted, would be attended with no difficulty, since it was a plan to promote the happiness of all -- she and Mr. Knightley meant to marry; by which means Hartfield would receive the constant addition of that person's company whom she knew he loved, next to his daughters and Mrs. Weston, best in the world.</div>

She was reminded, more than once, of having always said she would never marry, and assured that it would be a great deal better for her to remain single; and told of poor Isabella, and poor Miss Taylor.-- But it would not do. Emma hung about him affectionately, and smiled, and said it must be so; and that he must not class her with Isabella and Mrs. Weston, whose marriages taking them from Hartfield, had, indeed, made a melancholy change: but she was not going from Hartfield; she should be always there; she was introducing no change in their numbers or their comforts but for the better; and she was very sure that he would be a great deal the happier for having Mr. Knightley always at hand, when he were once got used to the idea.-- Did he not love Mr. Knightley very much?-- He would not deny that he did, she was sure.-- Whom did he ever want to consult on business but Mr. Knightley?-- Who was so useful to him, who so ready to write his letters, who so glad to assist him?-- Who so cheerful, so attentive, so attached to him?-- Would not he like to have him always on the spot?-- Yes.

<div class="line_en">Mr. Woodhouse could not be soon reconciled; but the worst was overcome, the idea was given; time and continual repetition must do the rest.-- To Emma's entreaties and assurances succeeded Mr. Knightley's, whose fond praise of her gave the subject even a kind of welcome; and he was soon used to be talked to by each, on every fair occasion.-- They had all the assistance which Isabella could give, by letters of the strongest approbation; and Mrs. Weston was ready, on the first meeting, to consider the subject in the most serviceable light -- first, as a settled, and, secondly, as a good one -- well aware of the nearly equal importance of the two recommendations to Mr. Woodhouse's mind.-- It was agreed upon, as what was to be; and every body by whom he was used to be guided assuring him that it would be for his happiness; and having some feelings himself which almost admitted it, he began to think that some time or other -- in another year or two, perhaps -- it might not be so very bad if the marriage did take place.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mrs. Weston was acting no part, feigning no feelings in all that she said to him in favour of the event.-- She had been extremely surprized, never more so, than when Emma first opened the affair to her; but she saw in it only increase of happiness to all, and had no scruple in urging him to the utmost.-- She had such a regard for Mr. Knightley, as to think he deserved even her dearest Emma; and it was in every respect so proper, suitable, and unexceptionable a connexion, and in one respect, one point of the highest importance, so peculiarly eligible, so singularly fortunate, that now it seemed as if Emma could not safely have attached herself to any other creature, and that she had herself been the stupidest of beings in not having thought of it, and wished it long ago.-- How very few of those men in a rank of life to address Emma would have renounced their own home for Hartfield! And who but Mr. Knightley could know and bear with Mr. Woodhouse, so as to make such an arrangement desirable!-- The difficulty of disposing of poor Mr. Woodhouse had been always felt in her husband's plans and her own, for a marriage between Frank and Emma. How to settle the claims of Enscombe and Hartfield had been a continual impediment -- less acknowledged by Mr. Weston than by herself -- but even he had never been able to finish the subject better than by saying --"Those matters will take care of themselves; the young people will find a way." But here there was nothing to be shifted off in a wild speculation on the future. It was all right, all open, all equal. No sacrifice on any side worth the name. It was a union of the highest promise of felicity in itself, and without one real, rational difficulty to oppose or delay it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="韦斯顿太太劝说他时并没有装假，流露出的都是真情实意。爱玛第一次向她透露这件事时，她不禁大吃一惊，真是从未这么惊奇过。但是转念一想，她觉得这件事只会使大家更为幸福，因此便毫不迟疑地极力鼓动伍德豪斯先生答应。她很器重奈特利先生，认为他甚至配得上她最亲爱的爱玛。无论从哪一方面看，这都是一门最合适、最般配、最完美的亲事，而且在某一点上，在最重要的一点上，更是特别妥当，特别，爱玛要是爱上了别人，那就不可能这么稳妥，她觉得自己真是天下最大的傻瓜，居然没有早想到这件事，早向他们祝福。一个有地位的人向爱玛求婚，愿意舍弃自己的家住到哈特菲尔德来，这多么难能可贵啊！除了奈特利先生，有谁能够了解并容忍伍德豪斯先生，做出这样理想的安排！她和丈夫有心撮合弗兰克和爱玛，但总觉得不好安排可怜的伍德豪斯先生。如何兼顾恩斯库姆和哈特菲尔德的利益，一直是个难题——而对这个困难，韦斯顿先生比他太太还缺乏认识——可是每次一谈到这件事，就连韦斯顿先生最终至多也只能这么说：“这些事情自会解决的，年轻人总会想出办法的。”可是现在不能凭胡思乱想来考虑问题。这件事合情合理、光明正大，又完全般配，双方谁也不吃亏。这是一门十分美满的亲事，没有任何真正的、站得住脚的理由来阻挠，来推迟。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He went to Highbury the next morning, and satisfied himself on that point. He told her the news. Was not she like a daughter, his eldest daughter?-- he must tell her; and Miss Bates being present, it passed, of course, to Mrs. Cole, Mrs. Perry, and Mrs. Elton, immediately afterwards. It was no more than the principals were prepared for; they had calculated from the time of its being known at Randalls, how soon it would be over Highbury; and were thinking of themselves, as the evening wonder in many a family circle, with great sagacity.</div>

<div class="line_en">The news was universally a surprize wherever it spread; and Mr. Weston had his five minutes share of it; but five minutes were enough to familiarise the idea to his quickness of mind.-- He saw the advantages of the match, and rejoiced in them with all the constancy of his wife; but the wonder of it was very soon nothing; and by the end of an hour he was not far from believing that he had always foreseen it.</div>

<div class="line_en">In general, it was a very well approved match. Some might think him, and others might think her, the most in luck. One set might recommend their all removing to Donwell, and leaving Hartfield for the John Knightleys; and another might predict disagreements among their servants; but yet, upon the whole, there was no serious objection raised, except in one habitation, the Vicarage.-- There, the surprize was not softened by any satisfaction. Mr. Elton cared little about it, compared with his wife; he only hoped "the young lady's pride would now be contented;" and supposed "she had always meant to catch Knightley if she could;" and, on the point of living at Hartfield, could daringly exclaim, "Rather he than I!"-- But Mrs. Elton was very much discomposed indeed.--"Poor Knightley! poor fellow!-- sad business for him.-- She was extremely concerned; for, though very eccentric, he had a thousand good qualities.-- How could he be so taken in?-- Did not think him at all in love -- not in the least.-- Poor Knightley!-- There would be an end of all pleasant intercourse with him.-- How happy he had been to come and dine with them whenever they asked him! But that would be all over now.-- Poor fellow!-- No more exploring parties to Donwell made for her. Oh! no; there would be a Mrs. Knightley to throw cold water on every thing.-- Extremely disagreeable! But she was not at all sorry that she had abused the housekeeper the other day.-- Shocking plan, living together. It would never do. She knew a family near Maple Grove who had tried it, and been obliged to separate before the end of the first quarter.</div>
