<div class="line_en">Never had such joy reigned in the nursery of the Large Family. Never had they dreamed of such delights as resulted from an intimate acquaintance with the little-girl-who-was-not-a-beggar. The mere fact of her sufferings and adventures made her a priceless possession. Everybody wanted to be told over and over again the things which had happened to her. When one was sitting by a warm fire in a big, glowing room, it was quite delightful to hear how cold it could be in an attic. It must be admitted that the attic was rather delighted in, and that its coldness and bareness quite sank into insignificance when Melchisedec was remembered, and one heard about the sparrows and things one could see if one climbed on the table and stuck one's head and shoulders out of the skylight.</div>

<div class="line_en">Of course the thing loved best was the story of the banquet and the dream which was true. Sara told it for the first time the day after she had been found. Several members of the Large Family came to take tea with her, and as they sat or curled up on the hearth-rug she told the story in her own way, and the Indian gentleman listened and watched her. When she had finished she looked up at him and put her hand on his knee.</div>

<div class="line_en">So he told them how, when he sat alone, ill and dull and irritable, Ram Dass had tried to distract him by describing the passers by, and there was one child who passed oftener than any one else; he had begun to be interested in her -- partly perhaps because he was thinking a great deal of a little girl, and partly because Ram Dass had been able to relate the incident of his visit to the attic in chase of the monkey. He had described its cheerless look, and the bearing of the child, who seemed as if she was not of the class of those who were treated as drudges and servants. Bit by bit, Ram Dass had made discoveries concerning the wretchedness of her life. He had found out how easy a matter it was to climb across the few yards of roof to the skylight, and this fact had been the beginning of all that followed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是他讲给大家听是怎么回事：当他病恹恹地凄然独坐，心情烦躁之时，拉姆·达斯就描述那些过路人来给他解闷儿，其中有个孩子来往得比谁都频繁。他开始对她感兴趣——或许一部分是由于他正苦思冥想着一个小女孩的缘故，一部分是由于拉姆·达斯曾讲过他追逐猴子进阁楼的那次意外造访。他描述了阁楼的惨淡面貌以及那孩子的举止，她似乎并不属于被当作苦工或仆人对待的那类人。拉姆·达斯一点一滴地发现了关于她生活中的不幸遭遇的情况，还发现爬过几码远的房顶到那天窗是件多么容易的事，这就引出了后来发生的一切。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The idea had been so fanciful that Mr. Carrisford's sad face had lighted with a smile, and Ram Dass had been so filled with rapture that he had enlarged upon it and explained to his master how simple it would be to accomplish numbers of other things. He had shown a childlike pleasure and invention, and the preparations for the carrying out of the plan had filled many a day with interest which would otherwise have dragged wearily. On the night of the frustrated banquet Ram Dass had kept watch, all his packages being in readiness in the attic which was his own; and the person who was to help him had waited with him, as interested as himself in the odd adventure. Ram Dass had been lying flat upon the slates, looking in at the skylight, when the banquet had come to its disastrous conclusion; he had been sure of the pro{}foundness of Sara's wearied sleep; and then, with a dark lantern, he had crept into the room, while his companion remained outside and handed the things to him. When Sara had stirred ever so faintly, Ram Dass had closed the lantern-slide and lain flat upon the floor. These and many other exciting things the children found out by asking a thousand questions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这主意着实富于幻想色彩，使卡里斯福特先生愁苦的面庞闪现了笑容，于是拉姆·达斯满心欢喜地详述一番，向他主人说明要完成许多其他的事是何等容易。他显示出孩子般的欢欣和想象，于是实施这计划所作的忙碌的准备工作使原本令人厌倦的漫长日子变得生趣盎然。在宴会被阻挠的那天夜里，拉姆·达斯一直在监视着，所有的包裹都在他自己住的阁楼里准备就绪，而他的助手也同他一起等着，对这个奇特的冒险计划同样深感兴趣。拉姆·达斯平卧在石板瓦上从天窗往里看，那时宴会已灾难性地被打断了。他相信疲惫的萨拉肯定会睡得很沉，于是带着一盏昏暗的提灯，偷偷爬进房间，他的同伴留在外面给他递东西。萨拉在睡梦中略一翻身，拉姆·达斯就拉上提灯的遮光罩，平卧在地板上。这些情况以及许多其他令人兴奋的事经过无数次的提问，使孩子们都明白了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There never were such friends as these two became. Somehow, they seemed to suit each other in a wonderful way. The Indian gentleman had never had a companion he liked quite as much as he liked Sara. In a month's time he was, as Mr. Carmichael had prophesied he would be, a new man. He was always amused and interested, and he began to find an actual pleasure in the possession of the wealth he had imagined that he loathed the burden of. There were so many charming things to plan for Sara. There was a little joke between them that he was a magician, and it was one of his pleasures to invent things to surprise her. She found beautiful new flowers growing in her room, whimsical little gifts tucked under pillows, and once, as they sat together in the evening, they heard the scratch of a heavy paw on the door, and when Sara went to find out what it was, there stood a great dog -- a splendid Russian boarhound -- with a grand silver and gold collar bearing an inscription. "I am Boris," it read; "I serve the Princess Sara."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从来没有像他们俩这般的朋友。不知怎的，他们似乎出奇地合得来。印度绅士还从没有过像萨拉这样心爱的伙伴。正像卡迈克尔先生所预言的那样，他在一个月内变成了一个新人。他总是乐呵呵的、兴致勃勃，并开始发现拥有那笔财富的真正乐趣，而原来却以为会是讨厌的负担。有好多可爱有趣的事要为萨拉筹划。他们俩之间常开个无伤大雅的玩笑，说他是个魔法师，而他的乐趣之一就是想出一些事情来使她惊奇。例如她会发现她房里开着美丽的鲜花，或者枕头下塞着稀奇古怪的小礼品。有一天傍晚，他们俩坐在一起，听到门上有沉重的爪子搔抓的声音，等萨拉跑过去看看是什么，发现有只大狗站在那儿——一只漂亮的俄国大猎犬——豪华的金银项圈上有凸起的题字：“我叫鲍里斯，我侍奉萨拉公主。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The next morning, Miss Minchin, in looking out of her window, saw the things she perhaps least enjoyed seeing. The Indian gentleman's carriage, with its tall horses, drew up before the door of the next house, and its owner and a little figure, warm with soft, rich furs, descended the steps to get into it. The little figure was a familiar one, and reminded Miss Minchin of days in the past. It was followed by another as familiar -- the sight of which she found very irritating. It was Becky, who, in the character of delighted attendant, always accompanied her young mistress to her carriage, carrying wraps and belongings. Already Becky had a pink, round face.</div>

<div class="line_en">"You see," said the woman, "I told her to come when she was hungry, and when she'd come I'd give her odd jobs to do; an' I found she was willing, and somehow I got to like her; and the end of it was, I've given her a place an' a home, and she helps me, an' behaves well, an' is as thankful as a girl can be. Her name's Anne. She has no other."</div>
