<div class="line_en">We have two nights left on the North Sea platform, then we return to Russia. At least I'm assuming that that's the case, as my passport contains no visa for any other country. Over the course of the day, I run through possible ways of contacting Tikhomirov. My only chance to do this will be when we've landed in Russia, and are making our way through the border controls. It will be impossible beforehand, while we are under the eye of Anton, and almost certainly impossible afterward.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The next day passes swiftly. I speak only when spoken to, ignore Oxana completely, and limit my exchanges with Charlie to calling the shots for them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I consider different scenarios. A diversion of some kind, in the course of which I throw myself on the mercy of customs or security officials. A medical emergency, perhaps, with me writhing on the arrivals' hall floor with simulated gastroenteritis. Could I carry that off? Unlikely. Anton will be looking out for any hint of weird or erratic behavior. He will keep us on a very short leash, and he's undoubtedly practiced in dealing with the kind of functionaries you find at Russian airports.</div>

<div class="line_en">We've been working our way through our evening meal for the best part of fifteen minutes when I realize what's happening right in front of my eyes. Anton's watching us from the head of the table, and making entries in a small spiral notebook.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He's writing. With a pencil.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When he's finished Anton shoves the notebook in his trouser pocket and tosses the pencil onto a worktop, between a box of plastic spoons and a glass jar filled with teabags. Looking up, he catches my eye, and we exchange tight, non-committal smiles. Neither of us has quite worked out how we should conduct ourselves with each other. He's tried to have me killed at least twice, and I've never disguised the fact that I find him repulsive. It's not the ideal basis for a relationship.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Maybe I could try to steal a phone? The passport queue would be a possible place to lift one from a fellow traveler's back pocket or bag. All I would have to do would be to input Tikhomirov's number and let it ring. He would know it was me and be able to identify my location and track the phone. The penalty if I was discovered, however, would be severe, and given how closely we would all be watched, discovery was the probable outcome.</div>

<div class="line_en">I glance at the pencil. It's almost hidden behind the cardboard spoon-box, and as I look away a plan comes to me fully formed. It's dangerous, so dangerous that I can't bring myself to think of it in too much detail, but it's all I have. And weirdly, it brings me a sort of peace.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sliding out of my bunk in combat clothes and socks, I open the door inch by inch, terrified that a squeak of hinges will betray me. Outside the cabin it's dark, but I've learned the layout. I'm on a small landing, inside one of the platform's cylindrical legs. Bolted to the wall opposite me is a ladder, which runs upward to the deck and downwards to the level of the sea. Below me is Ginge's cabin. Above me is Anton's. I've got to get past his door without him hearing me if I'm to get to the deck.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Taking a deep breath, I begin to climb the ladder. My socks are slippery on the cold steel rungs, and I can feel my heart pounding fearfully in my chest, but I force myself to keep going. There's no sound from Anton's cabin. I move upward, and now I can hear the faint hum of the generator that provides the platform with power; it's housed in a hut next to the canteen.</div>

<div class="line_en">As I haul myself through the hatch onto the platform deck, a gale-force wind whips my hair into my eyes. Above me the sky is a streaky blue-black, around me the sea is a roiling gray, faintly illuminated by the warning lights at each corner of the platform. I crouch there for a moment. I can no longer hear the generator, only the scream of the wind and the crashing of the waves. Then, keeping low, I run to the canteen and close the door behind me. Inside it's quieter, but no less cold. A couple of steps take me to the worktop, and I reach around the box of spoons for the pencil.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A moment later it's in my hand, and just as I feel its hexagonal shape between my fingers the door swings open and a torch shines in my face. The shock is so great that I stop breathing, and stare open-mouthed into the light.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You deceitful cunt," Anton says. "I knew I was right about you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I can't see his face behind the torch beam, but I can imagine the sneer. There's no way I can escape. He's standing between me and the door.</div>

<div class="line_en">"You were going to try and get a message out, weren't you? You saw me writing notes with a pencil and you thought, I'll have that. Well you know what, you dumb dyke, that's exactly what you were supposed to think. I left the pencil there knowing you'd come looking for it. You fucking women, honestly."</div>

<div class="line_en">I continue to pull away from Anton with all my strength, grunting with the effort, and then I jump forward, unbalancing him so that he falls heavily backward and cracks his head on the steel door jamb. As he lies there, half-stunned and blinking in the raking torch beam, I shove the pencil as hard as I can up his left nostril.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I wish I'd saved everyone's time and killed you in St. Petersburg. You and your psycho girlfriend. But hey, better late than never." He reaches out with his free hand and grabs my arm, wrenching me toward the open door. I resist, pulling back hard, and as I do so I have the surreal impression that my body has been occupied by someone else. Someone strong, and ruthlessly efficient. Someone like Oxana.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Waves of fury wash through me. I feel weirdly focused and light-headed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Anton's eyes widen, his fingers writhe, and a quavering sound issues from his throat. He tries to lift his head, but I keep hold of the protruding end of the pencil and push downwards, forcing it further and further up his nose. The pencil sticks fast after about ten centimeters, so I put my weight behind it, and it slips in another couple of centimeters. Taking the torch from Anton's hand, I shine it in his face. His eyes have rolled back into his head, his lips are fluttering, and a worm of blood is crawling from his open nostril into his mouth.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Fucking women," I murmur. "What can you do, eh?" The point of the pencil has almost certainly penetrated Anton's brain, but not lethally. I need something hard and heavy. "Stay there," I order him, and shine the torch around the canteen. Lying on the bookshelf is a substantial hardback volume. I'm reaching for this, when Anton half-rises to his feet, his eyes staring wildly. Grabbing the book with both hands I draw it back, take aim, and smack the pencil in another inch. He sinks to the floor, his legs moving feebly.</div>

<div class="line_en">I've forgotten that securing the pencil was the point of the whole exercise. I nod and, kneeling beside Anton, try to pull it out of his nose with my fingertips. Anton's eyes roll in his head but I can't budge it, it's stuck tight.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Do you still want that pencil?" Oxana shouts, as the wind screams in our ears.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We do it. Oxana locks her fingers under Anton's jaw, and I lean sideways into his face and close my teeth on the end of the pencil. His lips are dry, his stubble rasps against my cheek, and his breath, now coming in shallow gasps, smells of brandy and curry. I pull at the pencil as hard as I can, but it doesn't move, and I'm afraid of snapping the end off with my teeth. Eventually I lift my head, gagging, and drag sea air into my lungs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Oxana tries, but does no better. She looks at me. "The only way we're going to do this is if I hold his head, and you take the end of the pencil between your teeth and pull it out."</div>

<div class="line_en">We spend the next ten minutes tidying up. While I wash off the worst of the blood with water from the canteen, Oxana creeps into Anton's room and finds me a clean T-shirt and combat shirt. I pull these on, then we locate the Napoleon bottle, which is still half full, and take it outside. Oxana pours the remaining brandy over the edge of the platform, and leaves the empty bottle standing on deck. I knot my bloody clothes into a bundle and, using the torch as a sinker, throw them out to sea. Then, with the night's work completed, we depart the deck. Behind me, Oxana closes the hatch.</div>

I turn on the light, we stand there for a moment, and then I pull back my arm and punch her in the mouth, as hard as I can.

<div class="line_en">When Anton doesn't show up for breakfast the next morning, no one takes much notice. The empty brandy bottle at the edge of the platform has been noted, and Nobby and Ginge make sympathetic references to hangovers and mornings after. By eight-thirty, however, the two men are looking at their watches and exchanging concerned glances. Ginge offers to go to Anton's cabin and wake him, and when he returns he looks grave.</div>

<div class="line_en">We return to the firing points. The sea and the sky are calmer today, and visibility much improved. Charlie's nailing pretty much every target at seven hundred meters plus, now. One shot, one kill, as Ginge continually impresses on us. From what I can see, Oxana's hit rate is every bit as consistent.</div>

<div class="line_en">We spend our last night on the platform in my cabin. I tell Oxana about the encounter with Tikhomirov, and how he asked me to contact him if I discover what the Twelve are planning, and I say that, if possible, I intend to do exactly this. The more important our target is, I argue, the less likely it is that the Twelve will let us walk away when the job's done. We're more than expendable, we're a liability.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">If I can make contact with Tikhomirov, on the other hand, and provide him with enough information to intercept us before we fire a shot, he may see an advantage in keeping us alive, and letting it be known that we were acting as his agents all along. Oxana is briefly angry that I didn't tell her earlier and deeply suspicious of any alliance with the FSB, but agrees that in the long run we are probably marginally better off relying on the state security service than the Twelve.</div>
