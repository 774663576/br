<div class="line_en">He looked out the window, although there wasn't much to see -- mostly fields of hay and cotton. He was on a long bus ride to nowhere. The bus wasn't air-conditioned, and the hot, heavy air was almost as stifling as the handcuffs.</div>

<div class="line_en">Stanley was sitting about ten rows back, handcuffed to his armrest. His backpack lay on the seat next to him. It contained his toothbrush, toothpaste, and a box of stationery his mother had given him. He'd promised to write to her at least once a week.</div>

<div class="line_en">Stanley and his parents had tried to pretend that he was just going away to camp for a while, just like rich kids do. When Stanley was younger he used to play with stuffed animals, and pretend the animals were at camp. Camp Fun and Games he called it. Sometimes he'd have them play soccer with a marble. Other times they'd run an obstacle course, or go bungee jumping off a table, tied to broken rubber bands. Now Stanley tried to pretend he was going to Camp Fun and Games. Maybe he'd make some friends, he thought. At least he'd get to swim in the lake.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利和他的父母都竭力装作斯坦利只是去野营一阵子，就像有钱人家的孩子那样。斯坦利小的时候，经常拿着一些毛绒动物玩具玩野营的游戏，他管那种游戏叫妙趣运动营。有时候他把弹珠当足球让动物们踢，有时候他让那些动物参加障碍跑，有时候还让动物们玩蹦极——把它们系在断了的橡皮筋上，让它们从桌子上纵身跳下。这会儿，斯坦利就装作是去参加妙趣运动营，他心想没准还能交上几个朋友，至少能在湖里游游泳吧。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He didn't have any friends at home. He was overweight and the kids at his middle school often teased him about his size. Even his teachers sometimes made cruel comments without realizing it. On his last day of school, his math teacher, Mrs. Bell, taught ratios. As an example, she chose the heaviest kid in the class and the lightest kid in the class, and had them weigh themselves. Stanley weighed three times as much as the other boy. Mrs. Bell wrote the ratio on the board, 3:1, unaware of how much embarrassment she had caused both of them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利没什么朋友。他太胖了，个头很大，学校里的其他孩子经常因此取笑他，就连老师有时候也会不知不觉说几句刻薄的话。在学校的最后一天，斯坦利的数学老师贝尔夫人在课堂上教比率。为了举例，她挑出全班最重的孩子和最轻的孩子，让他们各自量出体重。斯坦利的体重是另外那个男孩的三倍。于是贝尔夫人在黑板上写下了比率3：1。她根本没有意识到自己的做法令两个男孩多么羞臊。">查看中文翻译</div>

Stanley and his parents didn't believe in curses, of course, but whenever anything went wrong, it felt good to be able to blame someone.</div>
