<div class="line_en">For this reason the master had been slightly suspicious about taking him on board. He was well known to all the Customs officers along the coast, engaging with these gentlemen in a mutual exchange of stratagems, each more cunning than the last, so he had at first thought that Dantès was an emissary of my lords the excisemen, who were using this ingenious method to root out some of the secrets of his trade. But the brilliance with which Dantès had succeeded in the test of fine navigation had entirely convinced him. Then, at the sight of the puff of smoke rising like a plume over the Château d'If and the distant sound of the explosion, he momentarily guessed that he had just taken on board one of those men -- in this respect like kings -- whose entrances and exits are honoured by the firing of cannon. This bothered him less, it must be said, than if the newcomer had been a Customs officer, and this new suspicion vanished like its predecessor when he saw how perfectly calm his latest recruit remained.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dantès had not been a day on board before he realized the sort of people he was dealing with. Without ever having had lessons from Abbé Faria, the worthy master of the Jeune-Amélie (as the Genoese tartan was called) was acquainted with more or less every language spoken around the great lake known as the Mediterranean, from Arabic to Provençal. This relieved him of the need to employ an interpreter -- a class of people who are always bothersome and sometimes indiscreet -- and made it easy for him to communicate, whether with any ships that he might encounter at sea, or with the little boats that he met along the coasts, or finally with those people, without name, nationality or evident profession, who are always to be found on the paved quaysides of seaports, living on mysterious and secret resources which one can only believe must come to them directly from Providence, since they have no other visible means of support: the reader may have guessed that Dantès was on a smugglers' ship.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓蒂斯上船不到一天，他和同航的人们就搞得很熟了。宙纳·阿米里号（这艘热那亚独桅船的船名）的这位可敬的船长，虽然没有受过法利亚长老的教导，但对于所谓地中海这个大湖沿岸的各种语言，从阿拉伯语到普罗旺斯语，却都能一知半解的说几句，所以他不必雇用翻译，多一个人总是多一个累赘，而且常常多一个泄漏秘密的机会。这种语言的能力，使他和人交换消息非常方便，不论是和他在海上所遇到的帆船，和那些沿着海岸航行的小舟，或和那些来历不明的人，这种人，没有姓名，没有国籍，没有明白的称呼，在海口的码头上老是可以看到他们，他们凭着那种秘密的收入过活，而由于看不出他们收入的来源，我们只能称他们是靠天过活的。我们可以下结论说，邓蒂斯是碰到了一艘走私船。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In this way, Edmond had the advantage of knowing what his master was, while his master did not know the same about him. Whenever the old seaman and his crew questioned him, and on whatever subject, he held firm and confessed nothing, giving a wealth of details about Naples or Malta, both of which he knew as well as he knew Marseille, and sticking to his first story with a consistency that was a credit to his memory. Thus the Genoan, wily as he was, let himself be taken in by Edmond, thanks to the young man's gentle manner, his experience of the sea and, above all, his unusual skill at deception.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以爱德蒙倒占了一着便宜，他可以知道船长是何等样人，而可不被船长知道他。不论那个老水手和他的船员用什么方法来进攻他，他总是防御得很坚固，丝毫没有泄漏真情，只坚持着他最初的一番话，正确地描绘出那不勒斯和马耳他的详细情形，这些地方他原知道得象马赛一样清楚。所以这个热那亚人虽然精明，却被邓蒂斯用温和的态度和熟练的航海技术蒙骗了过去。">查看中文翻译</div>

He could remember the young man quite clearly; now he would discover what he had become as a mature one. As far as his companions were concerned, he had fulfilled his vow. He had already been twenty times to Leghorn and knew a barber in the Rue Saint-Fernand. That was where he went to have his beard shaved and his hair cut.</div>

At that time it was not yet the fashion to wear one's beard and hair long; nowadays a barber would rather be surprised that a man who could enjoy such physical attributes should wish to deprive himself of them. He said nothing and set about his work.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dantès was now thirty-three years old, as we have said, and his fourteen years in prison had brought what might be described as a great spiritual change to his features. He had entered the Château d'If with the round, full, radiant face of a contented young man whose first steps in life have been easy and who looks to the future as a natural extension of the past. All that had changed utterly.</div>

<div class="line_en">His oval face had lengthened and his once merry lips had adopted a fixed, firm line that spoke of stern resolve. His eyebrows arched under a single, pensive line and his eyes themselves were imprinted with deep sadness, behind which from time to time could be seen dark flashes of misanthropy and hatred. His complexion, kept so long from daylight and the sun, had taken on the dull tones that give such aristocratic beauty to men of the north when black hair frames their faces. Moreover the knowledge that he had acquired gave a look of intelligent self-confidence to his whole face. Though naturally quite tall, his body had taken on the compact vigour of one that has learnt to concentrate all its strength within itself.</div>

<div class="line_en">The elegance of lean, nervous limbs had been replaced by the solidity of a well-built, muscular man. His voice, accustomed to prayers, sobs and curses, had at times a strangely soft resonance, at others a rough edge that was almost husky. In addition, having been constantly in darkness or half-light, his eyes had acquired the remarkable ability of seeing in the dark, like those of wolves and hyenas.</div>

<div class="line_en">The master of the Jeune-Amélie, who was very keen to keep someone of Edmond's ability in his crew, had offered him an advance on his share of future profits and Edmond had accepted, so the first thing he did on leaving the barber's where he had undergone this preliminary metamorphosis was to find a shop where he could buy a complete set of seaman's clothes. Of course, this is very simple, consisting of white trousers, a striped shirt and a Phrygian cap.</div>

<div class="line_en">The crew of the Jeune-Amélie was a very busy one and subject to a master who was not used to wasting time. They had been hardly a week in Leghorn before the ship's swelling hold was full of coloured muslin, forbidden cotton cloth, English powder, and tobacco on which the state monopoly had forgotten to put its stamp. They had to get all this out of Leghorn, duty paid, and unload it on the Corsican coast, from where certain speculators would take charge of conveying it to France.</div>

<div class="line_en">Edmond returned the trousers and shirt that Jacopo had lent him, and appeared in his new dress before the master of the Jeune-Amélie, who asked him to repeat his story. The master could hardly recognize the heavily bearded man, half drowned and with seaweed in his hair, whom he had brought, naked and dying, on to the deck of his ship, in this smartly dressed and stylish sailor. Encouraged by this change in appearance, he repeated his offer to take Dantès on, but Dantès would accept it for only three months; he had plans of his own.</div>

<div class="line_en">Waiting, fortunately, was something that he knew how to do. He had waited fourteen years for his freedom and, now that he was free, he could easily wait for six months or a year to obtain his wealth. Would he not have chosen freedom without wealth if he had been offered it? In any case, was the wealth not an illusion, which had been born in poor Abbé Faria's sick brain and died with him? Yet Cardinal Spada's letter was oddly precise -- and Dantès repeated it in his head from beginning to end. He had not forgotten a single word.</div>

So Edmond wanted to tempt Jacopo: as a reward for his care, he offered him his share of the bounty, but Jacopo refused indignantly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="幸而，我们已经说过，爱德蒙只是受伤，在敷上了撒地尼亚老太婆卖给走私贩子的某种草药（这些草药是在某些季节采集来的）以后，伤口不久就合拢了。爱德蒙为了想试一试贾可布，就拿出他所得的红利的一部分来，以报偿他的照顾之情，但贾可布愤愤地拒绝了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In short, could it be that the world was neither as good as Doctor Pangloss pretended, nor as bad as it seemed to Dantès, since this man, who had nothing to expect from his friend except to inherit his part of the bounty, had felt such distress at seeing him fall dead?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那末，这个世界虽没有象班格罗斯医生①所相信的那样好，却也没有象邓蒂斯所认为的那样坏，因为这个人，除了能从他伙伴的身上可以承袭那一份红利以外再没有什么可希冀的，但当他看见他倒下的时候，却表示了这样深重的悲哀。【注：①伏尔泰小说《老实人》中的人物。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In this way, during the long days on board, when the ship was safely gliding across an azure sea with a favourable wind swelling its sails and needing no more than the attention of its helmsman, Edmond would take a chart of the coast and make himself Jacopo's instructor as poor Abbé Faria had become Edmond's. He showed him how to take bearings in coastal waters, explained the compass to him and taught him to read in that great open book above our heads which is called the sky and in which God writes on the blue firmament in diamond letters.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，当那帆船在浅蓝色的海面上平稳地滑行，当他们感谢顺风吹涨了它的帆，除了舵手以外其他一无所需的时候，爱德蒙就利用船上这漫长的时日，手里拿了一张地图，做起贾可布的导师来，就象可怜的法利亚长老做他的导师一样。他向他指出海岸线的位置，向他解释罗盘的各种变化，教他读那本摊开在我们头上，上帝用钻石做成的字写在蓝空上的，所谓“天”的大书。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As a result of this kind of sympathetic devotion that Jacopo had accorded to Edmond from the first moment that they met, Edmond conceded a certain degree of affection to Jacopo. The latter asked for nothing better: he had perceived in Edmond a great superiority to his present state, something that Edmond had managed to conceal from the others; so the good sailor was satisfied with the little that Edmond gave him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是一种同情爱，贾可布在第一次遇见爱德蒙的时候就把这种爱给了他，结果是爱德蒙对贾可布也发生了某种程度的情感，贾可布觉得这已经够了。他已经本能地觉察到爱德蒙的卓越，一种别人都没有觉察到的卓越；而用了那一点来衡量爱德蒙所赐于他的情意，那勇敢的水手也就满足了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Twenty times he had sailed one way or the other past his island of Monte Cristo, but not once had he found an opportunity to land there. So he made a resolution, which was that, as soon as his contract with the master of the Jeune-Amélie came to an end, he would hire a little boat on his own account (which he could well do, having saved around a hundred piastres on his different voyages) and, on some pretext or other, sail to Monte Cristo.</div>

<div class="line_en">This time, an important matter was under discussion. There was a ship loaded with Turkish carpets and cloth from the Levant and Kashmir.

The bounty was so large that, if they were successful, each man should have fifty or sixty piastres.</div>

<div class="line_en">When he returned to the discussion, it had been decided that they would land on Monte Cristo, setting off on this expedition the following night.

<div class="line_en">The master of the Jeune-Amélie proposed disembarking on the island of Monte Cristo: since it was deserted and there were no soldiers or Customs men on it, it seemed to have been set down in the midst of the sea in the days of the pagan Olympus by Mercury, God of Tradesmen and Thieves -- two sorts of people whom we consider separate, if not entirely distinct, but whom Antiquity appears to have classed together.</div>
