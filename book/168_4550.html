<div class="line_en">"Keep your head down and your mouth shut," the Hound warned her as the three spurred toward them; a knight and two squires, lightly armored and mounted on fast palfreys. Clegane cracked his whip at the team, a pair of old drays that had known better days. The wayn was creaking and swaying, its two huge wooden wheels squeezing mud up out of the deep ruts in the road with every turn. Stranger followed, tied to the wagon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“低头，闭上嘴巴。”猎狗警告她。对方一行三人：一个骑士和两个侍从，轻便装甲，骑乘快马。克里冈朝拉车的牲口一甩鞭子，这对老马无疑有过风光岁月，而今却颇有些疲态。马车吱嘎摇晃，两只巨大木轮一边转动，一边挤压路上的烂泥，刻出深深的车辙。陌客被绳索系于马车上，跟在后面。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The big bad-tempered courser wore neither armor, barding, nor harness, and the Hound himself was garbed in splotchy green roughspun and a soot-grey mantle with a hood that swallowed his head. So long as he kept his eyes down you could not see his face, only the whites of his eyes peering out. He looked like some down-at-heels farmer. A big farmer, though. And under the roughspun was boiled leather and oiled mail, Arya knew. She looked like a farmer's son, or maybe a swineherd. And behind them were four squat casks of salt pork and one of pickled pigs' feet.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Salt pork never pleases me." The pitchfork knight gave Clegane only the most cursory glance, and paid no attention at all to Arya, but he looked long and hard at Stranger. The stallion was no plow horse, that was plain at a glance. One of the squires almost wound up in the mud when the big black courser bit at his own mount. "How did you come by this beast?" the pitchfork knight demanded.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“咸肉才不会让我满意。”草叉骑士极粗略地扫了克里冈一眼，对艾莉亚则根本没留意，但他狠狠瞪了陌客良久。显而易见，这不是犁地的马，一眼就看得出来。大黑马咬向一位侍从的坐骑，差点害他摔到泥地上。“你打哪儿搞到这家伙的？”草叉骑士提问。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The riders split and circled them for a look before they came up close. Clegane drew the wayn to a halt and waited patiently on their pleasure. The knight bore spear and sword while his squires carried longbows. The badges on their jerkins were smaller versions of the sigil sewn on their master's surcoat; a black pitchfork on a golden bar sinister, upon a russet field. Arya had thought of revealing herself to the first outriders they encountered, but she had always pictured grey-cloaked men with the direwolf on their breasts. She might have risked it even if they'd worn the Umber giant or the Glover fist, but she did not know this pitchfork knight or whom he served. The closest thing to a pitchfork she had ever seen at Winterfell was the trident in the hand of Lord Manderly's merman.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="骑兵们分散开来，包围了他们，打量片刻后方才靠近。克里冈停住马车，耐心等待，毫无违拗。骑士装备矛和剑，侍从们则拿长弓，其衣服上的徽纹比主人外套上缝的小一号：褐底上一条金色对角斜纹，上有一柄草叉。照艾莉亚的打算，一碰上巡逻队就该立刻揭露身份，但她以为能遇上胸口绣有冰原狼的灰袍武士，哪怕是安柏家的碎链巨人或葛洛佛家的钢甲铁拳，都会冒险一试，但自己实在不认识这位草叉骑士，也不知他为谁效力。曼德勒伯爵的旗帜上白色人鱼手握三叉戟，这是她在临冬城所见过最接近草叉的纹章。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Aye, m'lord." The Hound snapped his whip again, and the old drays resumed their weary trek. The wheels had settled deep into the mud during the halt, and it took several moments for the team to pull them free again. By then the outriders were riding off. Clegane gave them one last look and snorted. "Ser Donnel Haigh," he said. "I've taken more horses off him than I can count. Armor as well. Once I near killed him in a melee."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是，大人。”猎狗一甩鞭子，两匹牲口便继续踏上疲惫的旅程。先前马车停下时，轮子深深陷入泥沼里，老马花了好一会儿时间才将它们重新拉出来。这时骑手们已走得远了，克里冈看了他们最后一眼，哼了一声。“唐纳尔·海伊爵士，”他说，“他输给我的马和铠甲数都数不清，有回我差点在团体比武中杀死他。”">查看中文翻译</div>

He might have known Stranger if he'd ever seen me ride him."</div>

<div class="line_en">Evenfall found them still trudging toward the Green Fork and Lord Frey's twin castles. I am almost there, Arya thought. She knew she ought to be excited, but her belly was all knotted up tight. Maybe that was just the fever she'd been fighting, but maybe not. Last night she'd had a bad dream, a terrible dream. She couldn't remember what she'd dreamed of now, but the feeling had lingered all day. If anything, it had only gotten stronger. Fear cuts deeper than swords. She had to be strong now, the way her father told her. There was nothing between her and her mother but a castle gate, a river, and an army… but it was Robb's army, so there was no real danger there. Was there?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="走到傍晚，他们离绿叉河和佛雷侯爵的双子城堡仍有一段距离。快到了，艾莉亚心想，她知道自己应该兴奋，不料肚内却绞作一团。这或许代表她仍在跟感冒抗争，或许不是。她记得昨晚做了个梦，一个可怕的噩梦，现在虽不清楚具体内容，但那种朦胧恍惚的感觉始终徘徊不去。不，变得越来越强烈了。恐惧比利剑更伤人。她必须变得坚强，就像父亲说的那样，不能当个哭哭啼啼的小女孩。在她和母亲之间别无他物，只有一道城门，一条大河和一支军队罢了…但那是罗柏的军队，所以没有真正的危险。不是吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He would have known your face, though. Arya had no doubt of that. Sandor Clegane's burns would not be easy to forget, once you saw them. He couldn't hide the scars behind a helm, either; not so long as the helm was made in the shape of a snarling dog.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="本该认出你，艾莉亚心想。无论谁见过桑铎·克里冈的灼伤，都不会轻易忘记。他也无法把伤疤隐藏在头盔后，因为头盔的形状是咆哮的狗。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A farmer chance-met on the kingsroad had provided them with wayn, horses, garb, and casks, though not willingly. The Hound had taken them at swordpoint. When the farmer cursed him for a robber, he said, "No, a forager. Be grateful you get to keep your smallclothes. Now take those boots off. Or I'll take your legs off. Your choice." The farmer was as big as Clegane, but all the same he chose to give up his boots and keep his legs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="国王大道上偶遇的一位农夫提供了车、马、衣服和木桶——当然并非自愿，而是猎狗仗剑抢劫所得。农夫咒骂他是强盗，他道，“不对，我是征集队的，让你留着内衣，还不快谢天谢地。发什么愣？要靴子还是要腿，你自己选。”那农夫个子跟克里冈一样高大，但还是乖乖地脱了靴子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That was why they'd needed the wayn and the pickled pigs' feet. "I'm not going to be dragged before your brother in chains," the Hound had told her, "and I'd just as soon not have to cut through his men to get to him. So we play a little game."</div>

<div class="line_en">Roose Bolton was one of them, though. The Leech Lord, as the outlaws called him. That made her uneasy. She had fled Harrenhal to get away from Bolton as much as from the Bloody Mummers, and she'd had to cut the throat of one of his guards to escape. Did he know she'd done that? Or did he blame Gendry or Hot Pie? Would he have told her mother? What would he do if he saw her? He probably won't even know me. She looked more like a drowned rat than a lord's cupbearer these days. A drowned boy rat. The Hound had hacked handfuls of her hair off only two days past. He was an even worse barber than Yoren, and he'd left her half bald on one side. Robb won't know me either, I bet. Or even Mother. She had been a little girl the last time she saw them, the day Lord Eddard Stark left Winterfell.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而还有卢斯·波顿呢。土匪们称他为“水蛭大人”，他让她很不安。她逃出赫伦堡不仅为了摆脱血戏班，也是为了摆脱波顿，而且在逃跑途中，还不得不割了他一个守卫的喉咙。他知道是她干的吗？他会责怪詹德利或热派吗？他会不会告诉她母亲呢？如果他看到她，会怎么做呀？也许他根本认不出我来。如今的她哪像领主的侍酒，简直是一只快淹死的老鼠。一只快淹死的公老鼠。两天前猎狗刚为她理了发，只是手段比尤伦更糟糕，将她一侧脑袋几乎弄成了秃顶。我敢打赌，罗柏，甚至母亲也认不出我。她最后一次见到他们是在艾德·史塔克公爵离开临冬城那天，一身小女孩打扮。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They heard the music before they saw the castle; the distant rattle of drums, the brazen blare of horns, the thin skirling of pipes faint beneath the growl of the river and the sound of the rain beating on their heads. "We've missed the wedding," the Hound said, "but it sounds as though the feast is still going. I'll be rid of you soon."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="未见城堡，先听到了音乐：在河流的咆哮和雨点的敲打之下，远处传来咚咚的鼓点、吼叫的号角和尖细的笛子声。“看来我们错过了婚礼，”猎狗道，“但宴会还在进行中。我很快就能摆脱你了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The music from the castles was louder here. The sound of the drums and horns rolled across the camp. The musicians in the nearer castle were playing a different song than the ones in the castle on the far bank, though, so it sounded more like a battle than a song. "They're not very good," Arya observed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="走近后，城堡里传出的乐音更加嘈杂，鼓号之声席卷营寨，而且近处城堡演奏的跟对岸还不一样，听起来简直像在打仗而非乐谣。“不怎么样。”艾莉亚评论。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The road had been running mostly northwest, but now it turned due west between an apple orchard and a field of drowned corn beaten down by the rain. They passed the last of the apple trees and crested a rise, and the castles, river, and camps all appeared at once. There were hundreds of horses and thousands of men, most of them milling about the three huge feast tents that stood side by side facing the castle gates, like three great canvas longhalls. Robb had made his camp well back from the walls, on higher, drier ground, but the Green Fork had overflown its bank and even claimed a few carelessly placed tents.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="之前道路基本朝西北延伸，这会儿却转向正西，穿过一个苹果园和一片饱受雨水蹂躏的玉米地，登上一段山坡，河流、城堡与营寨突然全部出现。成百上千的人和马聚在三座硕大的帐篷周围。这三座大帐并排而立，面对城堡大门，如同三个帆布大厅。罗柏将自己的军营设在远离城堡，地势较高，相对干燥的地方，但绿叉河水溢出堤岸，甚至淹没了某些搭建位置不够小心的帐篷。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Hound made a sound that might have been a laugh. "There's old deaf women in Lannisport complaining of the din, I'll warrant. I'd heard Walder Frey's eyes were failing, but no one mentioned his bloody ears."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="猎狗哼了一哼，也许是发笑。“我敢保证，连兰尼斯港里的聋子老太婆都会抱怨这没来由的噪声。听说瓦德·佛雷眼睛不行，怎么没人提他那该死的耳朵呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A hedge of wagons and carts had been drawn up along the perimeter to make a crude wooden wall against any attack. That was where the guards stopped them. The lantern their sergeant carried shed enough light for Arya to see that his cloak was a pale pink, spotted with red teardrops. The men under him had the Leech Lord's badge sewn over their hearts, the flayed man of the Dreadfort. Sandor Clegane gave them the same tale he'd used on the outriders, but the Bolton sergeant was a harder sort of nut than Ser Donnel Haigh had been. "Salt pork's no fit meat for a lord's wedding feast," he said scornfully.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Hound's whip spurred the team toward the tents. No one seemed to pay them any mind. They splashed past rows of brightly colored pavilions, their walls of wet silk lit up like magic lanterns by lamps and braziers inside; pink and gold and green they glimmered, striped and fretty and chequy, emblazoned with birds and beasts, chevrons and stars, wheels and weapons. Arya spotted a yellow tent with six acorns on its panels, three over two over one. Lord Smallwood, she knew, remembering Acorn Hall so far away, and the lady who'd said she was pretty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="猎狗扬鞭催马朝帐篷而去，没人施以任何关注。人马溅起水花，经过排排色彩明亮的帐篷，潮湿的丝墙被里面的油灯和火盆映照得如同魔法灯笼：粉色、金色和绿色，条纹、波浪与方格，飞鸟、野兽、尖角、星星、车轮和武器。艾莉亚发现一个镶有六颗橡果的黄帐篷，上面三颗，中间两颗，最下面一颗。这定是斯莫伍德伯爵，她心想，忽然记起遥远的橡果厅，还有赞她美丽的斯莫伍德夫人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But for every shimmering silk pavilion there were two dozen of felt or canvas, opaque and dark. There were barracks tents too, big enough to shelter two score footsoldiers, though even those were dwarfed by the three great feast tents. The drinking had been going on for hours, it seemed. Arya heard shouted toasts and the clash of cups, mixed in with all the usual camp sounds, horses whinnying and dogs barking, wagons rumbling through the dark, laughter and curses, the clank and clatter of steel and wood. The music grew still louder as they approached the castle, but under that was a deeper, darker sound: the river, the swollen Green Fork, growling like a lion in its den.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="闪耀的丝绸帐篷周围，有二十多倍的毡皮和帆布帐篷，黑乎乎的不透光。此外还有军用帐篷，每个都足以容纳四十名士兵，然而这些比起那三座婚宴大帐来，简直和侏儒无异。宴会似乎已进行了几个钟头，到处都是高声祝酒、杯盏碰撞，混杂着常有的马嘶、狗吠，车辆隆隆声、笑骂、钢铁和木头咔哒哐当的撞击声。随着城堡的接近，音乐越来越响，底下又有一层更为黑暗更为阴郁的声音——那条河，那条高涨的绿叉河，仿佛一头在巢穴里咆哮的狮子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Arya twisted and turned, trying to look everywhere at once, hoping for a glimpse of a direwolf badge, for a tent done up in grey and white, for a face she knew from Winterfell. All she saw were strangers. She stared at a man relieving himself in the reeds, but he wasn't Alebelly. She saw a half-dressed girl burst from a tent laughing, but the tent was pale blue, not grey like she'd thought at first, and the man who went running after her wore a treecat on his doublet, not a wolf. Beneath a tree, four archers were slipping waxed strings over the notches of their longbows, but they were not her father's archers. A maester crossed their path, but he was too young and thin to be Maester Luwin. Arya gazed up at the Twins, their high tower windows glowing softly wherever a light was burning. Through the haze of rain, the castles looked spooky and mysterious, like something from one of Old Nan's tales, but they weren't Winterfell.</div>

Arya glanced inside as the Hound drove past the first of the three, and saw hundreds of men crowding the benches and jostling around the casks of mead and ale and wine. There was hardly room to move inside, but none of them seemed to mind. At least they were warm and dry. Cold wet Arya envied them. Some were even singing. The fine misty rain was steaming all around the door from the heat escaping from inside. "Here's to Lord Edmure and Lady Roslin," she heard a voice shout. They all drank, and someone yelled, "Here's to the Young Wolf and Queen Jeyne."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="婚宴大帐里人群最为稠密。宽大的帐门被高高系起，人们忙碌进出，手拿酒盅酒杯，有的还带着营妓。经过三座中的第一座时，艾莉亚趁机朝里面瞥了一眼，只见数百人挤在长凳上，竟相推搡桶桶蜜酒、麦酒和葡萄酒，几乎没有活动空间，但大家都喝得兴高采烈。至少他们温暖干燥，而我又冷又湿，艾莉亚羡慕地想。有些人甚至放声歌唱，帐门口，细柔若丝的雨点被溢出的热气蒸发。“敬艾德幕老爷与萝丝琳夫人！”一个声音叫喊。他们全喝醉了，又有人叫道，“敬少狼主和简妮王后！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Firepits had been dug outside the feast tents, sheltered beneath rude canopies of woven wood and hides that kept the rain out, so long as it fell straight down. The wind was blowing off the river, though, so the drizzle came in anyway, enough to make the fires hiss and swirl. Serving men were turning joints of meat on spits above the flames. The smells made Arya's mouth water. "Shouldn't we stop?" she asked Sandor Clegane. "There's northmen in the tents." She knew them by their beards, by their faces, by their cloaks of bearskin and sealskin, by their half-heard toasts and the songs they sang; Karstarks and Umbers and men of the mountain clans. "I bet there are Winterfell men too." Her father's men, the Young Wolf's men, the direwolves of Stark.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大帐外面挖了火坑，用木头和兽皮编织的粗糙顶篷遮盖，足以挡住垂直而降的雨水。然而风从河面斜斜地吹来，因此雨丝终究还是飘了进去，让火焰嘶嘶作响，盘旋跳跃。仆人们在火上翻转大块烤肉，香味让艾莉亚直流口水。“我们停下吧？”她问桑铎·克里冈，“帐篷里有北方人呢。”她知道，凭他们的胡子、他们的面孔、他们的熊皮和海豹皮斗篷，他们若隐若现的祝酒声与唱的歌就知道，这是卡史塔克家、安柏家和山地氏族的人。“我敢打赌其中也有临冬城的人。”她父亲的人，少狼主的人，史塔克家的狼仔。">查看中文翻译</div>
