<div class="line_en">Neither hears me. Perhaps it's the hiss of the rain or is it their age seals their ears? I call again, and now the old man looks about him and sees me at last. Finally she slides down into his arms, and though she's but a thin sparrow, I see he's barely strength left to hold her. So I leave my shelter, and the old man turns in alarm to see me splash across the grass. But he accepts my assistance, for wasn't he about to sink to the earth, his good wife's arms still circling his neck? I take her from him and hurry back to the trees, she no burden to me at all. I hear the old man panting at my heels. Perhaps he fears for his wife in the arms of a stranger. So I set her down with care, to show I mean them only friendship. I place her head against the soft bark, and well sheltered above, even if a drop or two still falls around her.</div>

<div class="line_en">They came riding through the rainstorm as I sheltered under the pines. No weather for a pair so long in years and the sagging horse no less weary. Does the old man fear for the animal's heart with one more step? Why else halt in the mud with twenty paces still to the nearest tree? Yet the horse stands with patience under the downpour as the old man lifts her down. Could they perform the task more slowly were they painted figures in a picture? "Come, friends," I call to them. "Hurry and take shelter."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我不能撒谎，而且我有自己的职责。“巧得很，”我回答，“海湾上就有个休息的小地方。是我自己搭的，用树枝和破布盖了个简单的屋顶。不到一个小时前，我留了个火堆在旁边，应该还可以重新点着。”">查看中文翻译</div>

The reddish hues of evening all across the shore, a foggy sun falling towards the sea, and my boat rocking out in the waves. With another show of gentleness, I laid her down under the rude cover of dried skins and branches, placing her head against a cushion of mossy rock. He comes fussing about her even before I can step away.</div>

<div class="line_en">Can I allow this? It will make my task no easier. "These pebbles make hard walking, friend," I say. "What will be the cost of your stumbling as you carry her?

<div class="line_en">"Don't worry, friend. What you told me merely echoes what I saw when you and your wife first came through the rain on that weary steed. Well, sir, no more talk, for who knows if another storm will come our way. Let's hurry to her and carry her to the boat."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不要担心，朋友。你对我说的话，只让我想起你和妻子骑着疲惫的马在雨中走来的场景。好啦，先生，不用再说了，谁知道下一场风暴会不会来呢。我们快点到她那儿去，抱她上船吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He walks at my side, muttering encouragement to her. Do I stride too swiftly? For now he lags behind, and as I carry her into the sea I feel his hand grasp desperately at my back. Yet this is no place to loiter, for my feet must discover the quay where it hides beneath the chilly water's surface. I step onto the stones, the lapping waves grow shallow again, and I enter the boat, hardly tilting though I carry her in my arms. My rugs near the stern wet from the rain. I kick away the soaked early layers and lay her down gently. I leave her sitting up, her head just beneath the gunwale, and search the chest for dry blankets against the sea wind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他在我身旁走着，一边低声说些鼓励她的话。我步子迈得太快了吗？因为他现在落到后面了，抱她走进海水的时候，我感觉他一只手死死抓着我的后背。但是，这可不是停留的地方，因为码头藏在冰冷的水面之下，我的脚必须找准位置。我踩到水下的石头上，海水又变浅了，在脚下涌动。我上了船，我怀里抱着她，但船身几乎没有倾斜。船尾的垫子淋了雨，已经湿了。我踢开上面几层湿透了的垫子，把她轻轻放下来。我让她自己慢慢坐起来，头就靠在船舷下方，然后到柜子里找毯子，帮她挡一挡海风。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I see the fire in him well enough now, for it blazes through his eyes. "I thought it well understood, boatman," he says, "my wife and I would cross to the island unseparated. Didn't you say so repeatedly, and this the purpose of your questions?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时候我能清楚地看出他内心的火，因为火苗都快从他眼里喷出来了。“我还以为我们都说好了呢，船夫，”他说，“我和妻子不能分开，要一起上岛。我不是已经说了很多遍吗？你问问题不也是为了这个目的吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Please don't misunderstand, friend," I say. "I speak only of the practical matter of crossing this water. It's beyond question the two of you will dwell on the island together, going arm in arm as you've always done. And if your son's burial place is found in some shaded spot, you may think of placing wild flowers about it, such as you'll find growing around the island. There'll be bell heather, even marigold in the woodland. Yet for this crossing today, I ask you to wait a while longer back on the shore. I'll see to it the good lady's comfortable on the opposite one, for I know a spot close to the boat's landing where three ancient rocks face one another like old companions. I'll leave her there well sheltered, yet with a view of the waves, and hasten back to fetch you. But leave us for now and wait on the shore a moment longer."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“请不要误会，朋友，”我说。“我只是说坐船渡海的实际操作问题。你们两人会一起住在岛上，手挽着手，和你们以前一样，这一点毫无疑问。如果在某个阴凉的地方找到你儿子的墓地，你可以考虑在周围放些野花，岛上有，你能找到。林地里有紫铃石楠，说不定还有金盏花呢。但是，今天渡海，我请你回到海滩上再等一会儿。我会保证好心的女士在对岸舒舒服服的，因为我知道船靠岸后不远处有个地方，三块古老的岩石面对面，像老朋友一样。我让她先在那儿待着，有石头遮风挡雨，还能看见海，然后我就尽快回来接你。但是，现在请你离开，回到岸上再等一会儿。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I feel him climb into the boat even as I wrap her and the floor rocks with his tread. "Friend," I say, "you see the waters grow more restless. And this is but a small vessel. I daren't carry more than one passenger at a time."</div>
