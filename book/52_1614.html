<div class="line_en">"No!" I yell, hurling myself at Finnick, for surely he intends to make certain that Peeta's dead, to keep any hope of life from returning to him. Finnick's hand comes up and hits me so hard, so squarely in the chest that I go flying back into a nearby tree trunk. I'm stunned for a moment, by the pain, by trying to regain my wind, as I see Finnick close off Peeta's nose again. From where I sit, I pull an arrow, whip the notch into place, and am about to let it fly when I'm stopped by the sight of Finnick kissing Peeta. And it's so bizarre, even for Finnick, that I stay my hand. No, he's not kissing him. He's got Peeta's nose blocked off but his mouth tilted open, and he's blowing air into his lungs. I can see this, I can actually see Peeta's chest rising and falling. Then Finnick unzips the top of Peeta's jumpsuit and begins to pump the spot over his heart with the heels of his hands. Now that I've gotten through my shock, I understand what he's trying to do.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不！”我大喊道，朝芬尼克扑过去，他肯定是想置皮塔于死地，而且绝不让他再活过来。芬尼克手臂一挥，正好打在我胸口上，我一下子被打飞了，撞在身后的的树干上。这一撞让我疼痛难忍，我喘着粗气，缓不过劲来，这时我看到芬尼克又去捏皮塔的鼻子。我坐在地上，拉开弓箭，正要把箭射出去，却看到芬尼克在亲皮塔的嘴。即使是芬尼克，这么做也太奇怪了，我停住了手。不，他不是在亲他，他捏住皮塔的鼻子，却张开了他的嘴，往他的嘴里费力地吹气。我可以看到皮塔的胸脯一起一伏。然后芬尼克打开皮塔的衣服拉链，用手掌按压他心脏的部位。我惊魂甫定，终于明白了他在干什么。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Once in a blue moon, I've seen my mother try something similar, but not often. If your heart fails in District 12, it's unlikely your family could get you to my mother in time, anyway. So her usual patients are burned or wounded or ill. Or starving, of course.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="以前，在一个明亮的月夜，我曾经看到妈妈这样做过，但不经常。毕竟，在十二区，如果一个人的心跳停止，他的家人就不会再来找妈妈了。所以，通常她的病人都是被烧伤的、砸伤的或生病的。或者，当然，也有过度饥饿的。">查看中文翻译</div>

Around the time that I'm deciding it's too late, that Peeta's dead, moved on, unreachable forever, he gives a small cough and Finnick sits back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但芬尼克生活的地方肯定不一样。无论他此时在做什么，以前肯定这么做过。他做得很有节奏，方法娴熟。我的箭渐渐垂向地面，也趴到跟前去看。我焦急万分，希望他能成功。痛苦而漫长的几分钟过去了，我的希望也破灭了。我正在想，太晚了，皮塔死了，永远地去了，这时，他轻咳了一下，芬尼克也挺直了身体。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's okay. It's just her hormones," says Finnick. "From the baby." I look up and see him, sitting back on his knees but still panting a bit from the climb and the heat and the effort of bringing Peeta back from the dead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没事，那只是她的荷尔蒙在起作用。”芬尼克说，“是因为怀孕的缘故。”我抬起头来看着他，因为爬山的疲劳、天气闷热、还有救皮塔的紧张，他仍然是气喘吁吁。">查看中文翻译</div>

He meets my eyes and I glare at him through my tears. It's stupid, I know, that his efforts make me so vexed. All I wanted was to keep Peeta alive, and I couldn't and Finnick could, and I should be nothing but grateful. And I am. But I am also furious because it means that I will never stop owing Finnick Odair. Ever. So how can I kill him in his sleep?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，不是——”我说着，却更加大声地、歇斯底里地哭了起来，来证明芬尼克有关孩子说法的正确。他看着我，我也泪眼朦胧地看着他。这很愚蠢，我知道，他刚才的举动让我无比懊恼。我想要的一切就是让皮塔活着，而我做不到，芬尼克做到了，我应该感激他。是的，我很感激他。可我也很生气，因为我永远都欠了芬尼克奥迪尔的人情。永远。那么，我怎么可能趁他睡着时杀死他？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No, he has to rest," I say. My nose is running like crazy and I don't even have a shred of fabric to use as a handkerchief. Mags rips off a handful of hanging moss from a tree limb and gives it to me. I'm too much of a mess to even question it. I blow my nose loudly and mop the tears off my face. It's nice, the moss. Absorbent and surprisingly soft.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，他需要休息。”我说。我一直在流鼻涕，可这里一条都没有，我没法擦鼻子。玛格丝把垂吊在树枝上的苔藓拽下了一团，递给我。我内心烦乱，想都没想，大声地擤鼻涕，擦掉满脸的泪痕。苔藓很好，吸干泪水，还很柔软。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I expect to see a smug or sarcastic expression on his face, but his look is strangely quizzical. He glances between Peeta and me, as if trying to figure something out, then gives his head a slight shake as if to clear it. "How are you?" he asks Peeta. "Do you think you can move on?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我预备要看到他脸上得意或者嘲讽的表情，可他的表情却怪怪的。他看看我，又看看皮塔，好像要看出点什么，之后又轻轻摇了摇头，好像说别再想这些了。“你怎么样？”他问皮塔“你觉得还能走吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, of course I don't mind." I force a smile. Peeta showing up in the arena wearing a mockingjay is both a blessing and a curse. On the one hand, it should give a boost to the rebels in the district. On the other, it's hard to imagine President Snow will overlook it, and that makes the job of keeping Peeta alive harder.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，当然不介意。”我勉强笑了笑。皮塔戴着嘲笑鸟图案出现在竞技场，这可能是一种祝福，也可能是一种不幸。一方面，它会给各区的反抗者以鼓励，另一方面，斯诺总统也绝不；忽视它的存在。这样，让皮塔活下去就更难了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I hesitate. To reveal that I know Beetee and Wiress's trick of recognizing a force field could be dangerous. I don't know if the Gamemakers made note of that moment during training when the two pointed it out to me or not. One way or the other, I have a very valuable piece of information. And if they know I have it, they might do something to alter the force field so I can't see the aberration anymore. So I lie. "I don't know. It's almost as if I could hear it. Listen."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我犹豫着，不知如何作答。比特和韦莉丝知道电磁力场的事，这要传出去，是很危险的。我不清楚在训练场当他们指出电磁力场的位置时，是否引起了极限赛组织者的注意。不管怎样，我得到的信息很有用。如果凯匹特人得知我掌握了这个信息，他们就会采取措施改变电磁力场，这样我就有可能无法辨认电磁力场周围的微妙变化。因而，我撒谎说：“我不知道。我好像能听到细微的声音。听。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Slowly would be better than not at all." Finnick helps Peeta to his feet while I pull myself together. Since I got up this morning I've watched Cinna beaten to a pulp, landed in another arena, and seen Peeta die. Still, I'm glad Finnick keeps playing the pregnancy card for me, because from a sponsor's point of view, I'm not handling things all that well.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“慢也比不走强。”芬尼克扶着皮塔站起来，我也振作了一下精神。自从今早起床，我经历了一连串可怕的事情：目睹了西纳被打得血肉模糊、进入到一个陌生的竞技场、眼看着皮塔死去。还好，芬尼克还打着我怀有身孕的牌，为了吸引赞助者，这是最妙的一招。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I walk with the force field on my left, because that's supposed to be the side with my superhuman ear. But since that's all made up, I cut down a bunch of hard nuts that hang like grapes from a nearby tree and toss them ahead of me as I go. It's good I do, too, because I have a feeling I'm missing the patches that indicate the force field more often than I'm spotting them. Whenever a nut hits the force field, there's a puff of smoke before the nut lands, blackened and with a cracked shell, on the ground at my feet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="左耳是我谎称超灵敏的耳朵，所以我走路时，把左耳朝向磁力场的位置。但这些都是骗人的，所以我从附近的树上摘一串像葡萄一样垂下的坚果，每走一段，就把它抛到前面去。这样很管用，我感觉多数时候并看不到电磁力场。每当树枝碰到电磁力场时，就会在树枝落地前冒出一股烟雾，坚果也随即被烧焦、果壳开裂，弹回到我的脚下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You," says Mags, nudging me forward, so I take the lead. Since we're to be moving slowly, Mags prefers to walk with the aid of a branch Finnick quickly fashions into a cane for her. He makes a staff for Peeta as well, which is good because, despite his protestations, I think all Peeta really wants to do is lie down.

But after another hour or so of this I realize it's futile. We're not making any progress to the left. In fact, the force field seems to be herding us along a curved path.

<div class="line_en">The tree I choose seems to jut higher into the air than the others. I make my way up the twisting boughs, staying as close to the trunk as possible. No telling how easily these rubbery branches will snap. Still I climb beyond good sense because there's something I have to see. As I cling to a stretch of trunk no wider than a sapling, swaying back and forth in the humid breeze, my suspicions are confirmed. There's a reason we can't turn to the left, will never be able to. From this precarious vantage point, I can see the shape of the whole arena for the first time. A perfect circle. With a perfect wheel in the middle. The sky above the circumference of the jungle is tinged a uniform pink. And I think I can make out one or two of those wavy squares, chinks in the armor, Wiress and Beetee called them, because they reveal what was meant to be hidden and are therefore a weakness. Just to make absolutely sure, I shoot an arrow into the empty space above the tree line. There's a spurt of light, a flash of real blue sky, and the arrow's thrown back into the jungle. I climb down to give the others the bad news.</div>

<div class="line_en">Finnick chooses a campsite about ten yards below the force field, saying we can use it as a weapon by deflecting our enemies into it if attacked. Then he and Mags pull blades of the sharp grass that grows in five-foot-high tufts and begin to weave them together into mats. Since Mags seems to have no ill effects from the nuts, Peeta collects bunches of them and fries them by bouncing them off the force field.

<div class="line_en">The white sun sinks in the rosy sky as we gather in the hut. I'm still leery about the nuts, but Finnick says Mags recognized them from another Games. I didn't bother spending time at the edible-plants station in training because it was so effortless for me last year. Now I wish I had. For surely there would have been some of the unfamiliar plants surrounding me. And I might have guessed a bit more about where I was headed. Mags seems fine, though, and she's been eating the nuts for hours. So I pick one up and take a small bite. It has a mild, slightly sweet flavor that reminds me of a chestnut. I decide it's all right. The rodent's strong and gamey but surprisingly juicy. Really, it's not a bad meal for our first night in the arena. If only we had something to wash it down with.</div>

<div class="line_en">We're all on our feet at once. Our thirst. The lack of springs. The tree rat's sharp front teeth and wet muzzle. There can only be one thing worth having inside these trees. Finnick goes to hammer the spile into the green bark of a massive tree with a rock, but I stop him. "Wait. You might damage it. We need to drill a hole first," I say.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们都站立起来。我们很渴。这里没有泉水。树鼠的嘴是湿的。这一切都说明树干里应该有一种有价值的东西。芬尼克拿起一块石头，正准备把插管楔到粗大的树干里，我拦住了他。“等一下，这样有可能把它弄坏。咱们得先在树上钻个孔。”我说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There's nothing to drill with, so Mags offers her awl and Peeta drives it straight into the bark, burying the spike two inches deep. He and Finnick take turns opening up the hole with the awl and the knives until it can hold the spile. I wedge it in carefully and we all stand back in anticipation. At first nothing happens. Then a drop of water rolls down the lip and lands in Mags's palm. She licks it off and holds out her hand for more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没有东西可以拿来钻孔，所以玛格丝把她的锥子拿出釆，皮塔一下子就把树皮穿透了，把锥子头插到两英寸深的地方。芬尼克和皮塔轮流在树上钻孔，最后开的口够大，完全可以把插管放进去。我小心翼翼地把插管楔进去，然后大家都往后退了一步，等待着结果。一开始，没什么动静。接着，一滴水珠从插管的小舌片上滴下来，滴在玛格丝的手心里，她随即用舌头把水添了，又伸出手去接。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">By wiggling and adjusting the spile, we get a thin stream running out. We take turns holding our mouths under the tap, wetting our parched tongues. Mags brings over a basket, and the grass is so tightly woven it holds water. We fill the basket and pass it around, taking deep gulps and, later, luxuriously, splashing our faces clean. Like everything here, the water's on the warm side, but this is no time to be picky.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们又拧了拧插管，重新调整了一下位置，接着一小溜水从管里流出来。我们大家轮流在插管下面用嘴接水，我们焦渴的舌面得到了滋润。玛格丝拿来一只篮子，篮子编织得很密，可以用来盛水。我们把篮子接满水后，大家就传着喝，大口大口地喝，接着，我们很奢侈地把水泼到脸上，把脸洗干净。像这里所有的东西一样，水也是温热的，但我们也顾不上去挑剔了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Finnick offers to take the first watch and I let him, knowing it has to be one of the two of us until Peeta's rested up. I lie down beside Peeta on the floor of the hut, telling Finnick to wake me when he's tired. Instead I find myself jarred from sleep a few hours later by what seems to be the tolling of a bell. Bong! Bong! It's not exactly like the one they ring in the Justice Building on New Year's but close enough for me to recognize it. Peeta and Mags sleep through it, but Finnick has the same look of attentiveness I feel. The tolling stops.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="芬尼克提出先由他放哨，我同意了，知道放哨的也只有我们两个人，皮塔要等休整好了才行。我躺在雨棚里的地上，紧挨着皮塔，告诉芬尼克如果他累了就叫醒我。几个小时后，我被一个声音惊醒，好像是鸣钟的声音，当！当！这不太像法院大楼发出的新年钟声，但很接近。皮塔和玛格丝还睡着，没听见，但芬尼克和我一样在注意听。接着钟声停了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Without our thirst to distract us, we're all aware of how exhausted we are and make preparations for the night. Last year, I always tried to have my gear ready in case I had to make a speedy retreat in the night. This year, there's no backpack to prepare. Just my weapons, which won't leave my grasp, anyway. Then I think of the spile and wrest it from the tree trunk. I strip a tough vine of its leaves, thread it through the hollow center, and tie the spile securely to my belt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="赶走了焦渴的困扰，疲劳又接踵而至。我们准备在此过夜。去年，我总是把自己的背囊备好，时刻准备着紧急撤退。但今年，已经没有什么背囊了，只有我的武器，而武器我是时刻不会离手的。然后我想起了插管。我把它小心地从树孔里拧出来，从树上摘下一根结实的藤条，穿在孔里，然后把插管牢牢地拴在腰带上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Moments after it stops, I see the fog sliding softly in from the direction of the recent downpour. Just a reaction. Cool rain on the steaming ground, I think. It continues to approach at a steady pace. Tendrils reach forward and then curl like fingers, as if they are pulling the rest behind them. As I watch, I feel the hairs on my neck begin to rise. Something's wrong with this fog. The progression of the front line is too uniform to be natural. And if it's not natural…</div>
