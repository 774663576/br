<div class="line_en">Barton Park was about half a mile from the cottage. The ladies had passed near it in their way along the valley, but it was screened from their view at home by the projection of a hill. The house was large and handsome; and the Middletons lived in a style of equal hospitality and elegance. The former was for Sir John's gratification, the latter for that of his lady. They were scarcely ever without some friends staying with them in the house, and they kept more company of every kind than any other family in the neighbourhood. It was necessary to the happiness of both; for however dissimilar in temper and outward behaviour, they strongly resembled each other in that total want of talent and taste which confined their employments, unconnected with such as society produced, within a very narrow compass. Sir John was a sportsman, Lady Middleton a mother. He hunted and shot, and she humoured her children; and these were their only resources. Lady Middleton had the advantage of being able to spoil her children all the year round, while Sir John's independent employments were in existence only half the time. Continual engagements at home and abroad, however, supplied all the deficiencies of nature and education; supported the good spirits of Sir John, and gave exercise to the good breeding of his wife.</div>

<div class="line_en">The arrival of a new family in the country was always a matter of joy to him, and in every point of view he was charmed with the inhabitants he had now procured for his cottage at Barton. The Miss Dashwoods were young, pretty, and unaffected. It was enough to secure his good opinion; for to be unaffected was all that a pretty girl could want to make her mind as captivating as her person. The friendliness of his disposition made him happy in accommodating those, whose situation might be considered, in comparison with the past, as unfortunate. In showing kindness to his cousins therefore he had the real satisfaction of a good heart; and in settling a family of females only in his cottage, he had all the satisfaction of a sportsman; for a sportsman, though he esteems only those of his sex who are sportsmen likewise, is not often desirous of encouraging their taste by admitting them to a residence within his own manor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乡里新来了一户人家，这对约翰爵士总是一件喜幸事儿。不管从哪个角度看，他给巴顿乡舍招来的新房客都使他着迷。三位达什伍德小姐年轻漂亮，毫不做作，这就足以博得他的好评，因为不屑做作正是年轻姑娘所缺乏的东西，装腔作势使其心灵不能像外貌一样具有魅力。爵士性情善良，每逢谁遭到不幸，总是提供方便。因此，能对几个表侄女表明一番好意，使他感到一个好心人的由衷喜悦；而能让一家女眷住进他的乡舍，却又使他感到一个行猎爱好者的由衷喜悦。因为对于一个行猎爱好者来说（虽然他只敬佩那些与他属于同一性别、也爱好打猎的人们），他并不是经常愿意把女人们引进自己的庄园居住，纵容她们得寸进尺。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Lady Middleton piqued herself upon the elegance of her table, and of all her domestic arrangements; and from this kind of vanity was her greatest enjoyment in any of their parties. But Sir John's satisfaction in society was much more real; he delighted in collecting about him more young people than his house would hold, and the noisier they were the better was he pleased. He was a blessing to all the juvenile part of the neighbourhood, for in summer he was for ever forming parties to eat cold ham and chicken out of doors, and in winter his private balls were numerous enough for any young lady who was not suffering under the unsatiable appetite of fifteen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="米德尔顿夫人素以做得一手好菜和善于料理家务为荣，出于这种虚荣心，她才对家里举行的每次宴会感到其乐无穷。不过，约翰爵士对社交活动的兴致却真诚多了。他喜欢招来一大帮年轻人，屋里都容纳不下，他们越吵闹，他越觉得高兴。他成了附近青少年一代的福星，因为一到夏天，他就接连不断地把大伙儿聚集起来，在室外吃冷冻火腿和烧鸡；到了冬天，他的家庭舞会多得不计其数，对于年轻姑娘来说，只要不是百跳不厌的十五岁少女，谁都会感觉心满意足。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mrs. Dashwood and her daughters were met at the door of the house by Sir John, who welcomed them to Barton Park with unaffected sincerity; and as he attended them to the drawing room repeated to the young ladies the concern which the same subject had drawn from him the day before, at being unable to get any smart young men to meet them. They would see, he said, only one gentleman there besides himself; a particular friend who was staying at the park, but who was neither very young nor very gay. He hoped they would all excuse the smallness of the party, and could assure them it should never happen so again. He had been to several families that morning in hopes of procuring some addition to their number, but it was moonlight and every body was full of engagements. Luckily Lady Middleton's mother had arrived at Barton within the last hour, and as she was a very cheerful agreeable woman, he hoped the young ladies would not find it so very dull as they might imagine. The young ladies, as well as their mother, were perfectly satisfied with having two entire strangers of the party, and wished for no more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="约翰爵士在门口迎接达什伍德母女，真诚地欢迎她们光临巴顿庄园。他陪着客人步入客厅，一再向几位小姐表示，没有找来几位漂亮小伙子来欢迎她们，他深感不安；前一天目的因见“四因”。，这个问题已经引起了他的不安。他说，除他之外，她们在这里只能见到一位男客。这是他的一位特别要好的朋友，现在就住在他的宅第里，不过他既不年轻，也不活跃。宾客这么少，希望小姐们见谅，并且向她们保证：以后决不会再发生类似情况。那天上午，他跑了好几家，想多拉几个人来，怎奈今宵是月明之夜，大家都有约会。幸运的是，米德尔顿夫人的母亲才来到巴顿不久。她是个非常快乐、非常和蔼的女人，爵士希望小姐们不会像她们想象的那样感到枯燥无味。几位小姐和她们的母亲见席上有两位素不相识的客人，也就心满意足，并没有别的奢望。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Colonel Brandon, the friend of Sir John, seemed no more adapted by resemblance of manner to be his friend, than Lady Middleton was to be his wife, or Mrs. Jennings to be Lady Middleton's mother. He was silent and grave. His appearance however was not unpleasing, in spite of his being in the opinion of Marianne and Margaret an absolute old bachelor, for he was on the wrong side of five and thirty; but though his face was not handsome, his countenance was sensible, and his address was particularly gentlemanlike.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从风度上看，客人布兰登上校似乎并不适合做约翰爵士的朋友，就如同米德尔顿夫人不适合做他的妻子、詹宁斯太太不适合做米德尔顿夫人的母亲一样。他沉默严肃，不过外貌倒不令人讨厌，尽管玛丽安和玛格丽特认为他一定是个老光棍，因为他已经过了三十五岁。虽说他的面孔不算漂亮，却显得神情明善，颇有绅士气派。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mrs. Jennings, Lady Middleton's mother, was a good-humoured, merry, fat, elderly woman, who talked a great deal, seemed very happy, and rather vulgar. She was full of jokes and laughter, and before dinner was over had said many witty things on the subject of lovers and husbands; hoped they had not left their hearts behind them in Sussex, and pretended to see them blush whether they did or not. Marianne was vexed at it for her sister's sake, and turned her eyes towards Elinor to see how she bore these attacks, with an earnestness which gave Elinor far more pain than could arise from such common-place raillery as Mrs. Jennings's.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="米德尔顿夫人的母亲詹宁斯太太是个上了年纪的女人，性情和悦，体态肥胖。她唠唠叨叨地说个不停，看样子很开心，也相当粗俗。她很能说笑话，自己也跟着哈哈大笑。到晚饭结束时，她已经情人长、情人短地说了不少俏皮话。她希望小姐们没把自己的心上人留在苏塞克斯，还假装看见她们羞红了脸，也不管是否真有其事。玛丽安为姐姐抱不平，感到十分恼火。她将目光转向埃丽诺，想看看她如何忍受这番攻击，谁想埃丽诺看见妹妹那副一本正经的神气，比听到詹宁斯太太那陈腐不堪的戏谑还感觉痛苦。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was nothing in any of the party which could recommend them as companions to the Dashwoods; but the cold insipidity of Lady Middleton was so particularly repulsive, that in comparison of it the gravity of Colonel Brandon, and even the boisterous mirth of Sir John and his mother-in-law was interesting. Lady Middleton seemed to be roused to enjoyment only by the entrance of her four noisy children after dinner, who pulled her about, tore her clothes, and put an end to every kind of discourse except what related to themselves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这伙人中，哪一位也没有任何与达什伍德母女志趣相投之处。不过，米德尔顿夫人过于阴沉，让人反感至极，相形之下能性和儿童的语言创造能力作了较充分的说明，目前已被运，严肃的布兰登上校、兴高采烈的约翰爵士及其岳母，倒还有趣一些。米德尔顿夫人好像只是饭后见她四个孩子吵吵嚷嚷地跑进来，兴致才高起来。这些孩子把她拖来拖去，扯她的衣服，于是，大伙除了谈论他们，别的话题全部停止。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the evening, as Marianne was discovered to be musical, she was invited to play. The instrument was unlocked, every body prepared to be charmed, and Marianne, who sang very well, at their request went through the chief of the songs which Lady Middleton had brought into the family on her marriage, and which perhaps had lain ever since in the same position on the pianoforte, for her ladyship had celebrated that event by giving up music, although by her mother's account, she had played extremely well, and by her own was very fond of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到了晚上，人们发现玛丽安很有音乐才能，便邀请她当场表演。钢琴打开了，大家都准备陶醉一番，玛丽安的歌喉非常优美，在众人的要求下，她演唱了乐谱里最动听的几首歌曲。这些乐谱都是米德尔顿夫人出嫁时带来的，后来放在钢琴上可能一直没有挪动过，因为米德尔顿夫人为了庆贺她的婚姻大事，便放弃了音乐。不过，照她母亲的话说，她弹得好极了；照她自己的话说，她非常喜爱音乐。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Marianne's performance was highly applauded. Sir John was loud in his admiration at the end of every song, and as loud in his conversation with the others while every song lasted. Lady Middleton frequently called him to order, wondered how any one's attention could be diverted from music for a moment, and asked Marianne to sing a particular song which Marianne had just finished. Colonel Brandon alone, of all the party, heard her without being in raptures. He paid her only the compliment of attention; and she felt a respect for him on the occasion, which the others had reasonably forfeited by their shameless want of taste. His pleasure in music, though it amounted not to that ecstatic delight which alone could sympathize with her own, was estimable when contrasted against the horrible insensibility of the others; and she was reasonable enough to allow that a man of five and thirty might well have outlived all acuteness of feeling and every exquisite power of enjoyment. She was perfectly disposed to make every allowance for the colonel's advanced state of life which humanity required.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽安的演唱受到热烈欢迎。每演唱完一支歌曲，约翰爵士便高声赞叹，而在表演的过程中，他又和人高声交谈。米德尔顿夫人一次次地叫他安静，不知道他听歌曲怎么能有哪怕是片刻的分心，而她自己却要求玛丽安演唱一支刚刚唱完的歌曲。宾主之间，唯独布兰登上校没有听得欣喜若狂。上校只是怀有敬意地听着；玛丽安当时对他也深表尊敬，因为其他人表现出来的庸俗趣味，理所当然地失去了她的敬意。上校对音乐的爱好虽然没有达到着迷的程度，没有与她自己等同，但是与其他人的麻木不仁相对照，却显得十分难能可贵。玛丽安非常通情达理地认为，一个三十五岁的男人可能早已失去了感情的敏锐性和对欢乐的强烈感受。她完全可以理解上校的老成持重，这是人类所必需的。">查看中文翻译</div>
