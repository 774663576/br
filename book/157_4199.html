Side by side for seven years we had mined, ranched, sold patent churns, herded sheep, took photographs and other things, built wire fences, and picked prunes. Thinks I, neither homocide nor flattery nor riches nor sophistry nor drink can make trouble between me and Paisley Fish. We was friends an amount you could hardly guess at. We was friends in business, and we let our amicable qualities lap over and season our hours of recreation and folly. We certainly had days of Damon and nights of Pythias.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Now, from the start of that courtship I had Paisley Fish hobbled and tied to a post. Each one of us had a different system of reaching out for the easy places in the female heart. Paisley's scheme was to petrify 'em with wonderful relations of events that he had either come across personally or in large print. I think he must have got his idea of subjugation from one of Shakespeare's shows I see once called 'Othello.' There is a coloured man in it who acquires a duke's daughter by disbursing to her a mixture of the talk turned out by Rider Haggard, Lew Dockstader, and Dr. Parkhurst. But that style of courting don't work well off the stage.</div>

Learn how to pick up her hand and hold it, and she's yours. It ain't so easy. Some men grab at it so much like they was going to set a dislocation of the shoulder that you can smell the arnica and hear 'em tearing off bandages. Some take it up like a hot horseshoe, and hold it off at arm's length like a druggist pouring tincture of asafoetida in a bottle. And most of 'em catch hold of it and drag it right out before the lady's eyes like a boy finding a baseball in the grass, without giving her a chance to forget that the hand is growing on the end of her arm. Them ways are all wrong.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“现在，我告诉你，我自己是怎样迷住一个女人，使她落到改姓的地步的。你只要懂得怎么抓起她的手，把它握住，她就成了你的人。讲讲固然容易，做起来并不简单。有的男人使劲拉住女人的手，仿佛要把脱臼的肩胛骨复位一样，简直叫你可以闻到山金车酊剂的气味，听到撕绷带的声音了。有的男人像拿一块烧烫的马蹄铁那样握着女人的手，又像药剂师把阿魏酊往瓶里灌时那样，伸直手臂，隔得远远的。大多数男人握到了女人的手，便把它拉到她眼皮下面，像小孩在草里寻找棒球似的，不让她忘掉她的手长在胳臂上。这种种方式都是错误的。">查看中文翻译</div>

He pretends he hasn't got a thing in his hand, and that the cat don't see him, and that he don't see the cat. That's the idea. Never drag her hand out where she'll have to take notice of it. Don't let her know that you think she knows you have the least idea she is aware you are holding her hand. That was my rule of tactics; and as far as Paisley's serenade about hostilities and misadventure went, he might as well have been reading to her a time- table of the Sunday trains that stop at Ocean Grove, New Jersey.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我把正确的方式告诉你吧。你可曾见过一个人偷偷地溜进后院，捡起一块石头，想扔一只蹲在篱笆上盯着他直瞧的公猫？他假装手里没有东西，假装猫没有看见他，他也没有看见猫。就是那么一回事。千万别把她的手拉到她自己注意得到的地方。你虽然清楚她知道你握着她的手，可是你得装出没事的样子，别露痕迹。那就是我的策略。至于佩斯利用战争和灾祸的故事来博得她的欢心，正像把星期日的火车时刻表念给她听一样。那天的火车连新泽西州欧欣格罗夫之类的小地方也要停站的。（注：欧欣格罗夫：新泽西州的滨海小镇，当时人口只有三千左右。）">查看中文翻译</div>

He explains that the only dry-goods store in town was closed for the wedding, and he couldn't get the kind of a boiled shirt that his taste called for until he had broke open the back window of the store and helped himself. Then he ranges up on the other side of the bride, and the wedding goes on. I always imagined that Paisley calculated as a last chance that the preacher might marry him to the widow by mistake.</div>
