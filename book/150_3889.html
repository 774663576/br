<div class="line_en">She had known him but a little while and had never taken much notice of him. She had no idea when or where they had first met till after their engagement he told her that it was at a dance to which some friends had brought him. She certainly paid no attention to him then and if she danced with him it was because she was good-natured and was glad to dance with any one who asked her. She didn't know him from Adam when a day or two later at another dance he came up and spoke to her. Then she she remarked that he was at every dance she went to.</div>

<div class="line_en">She was faintly amused; she wondered why he thought it could in the least interest her; but she liked to please, so she looked at him with that dazzling smile of hers and her beautiful eyes, dewy ponds under forest trees, held an enchanting kindness.</div>

<div class="line_en">She did not know why he came to dances, he did not dance very well, and he seemed to know few people. She had a passing thought that he was in love with her: but she dismissed it with a shrug of the shoulders: she had known girls who thought every man they met was in love with them and had always found them absurd. But she gave Walter Fane just a little more of her attention. He certainly did not behave like any of the other youths who had been in love with her. Most of them told her so frankly and wanted to kiss her: a good many did. But Walter Fane never talked of her and very little of himself. He was rather silent; she did not mind that because she had plenty to say and it pleased her to see him laugh when she made a facetious remark; but when he talked it was not stupidly. He was evidently shy. It appeared that he lived in the East and was home on leave.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她不知道他为什么要参加舞会，他的舞跳得差极了，而且他好像谁也不认识。她忽然想到他会不会爱上她了，但是马上耸耸肩打消了这个念头。她知道好多女孩一厢情 愿地认为她们遇见的每个男人都爱上了她们，事实证明她们荒谬极了。不过，她对瓦尔特的注意比以前多了一些。他不像其他爱上她的男孩。他们大都大胆地向她表 白，告诉她他们想亲吻她。这样的人的确不少。但是瓦尔特·费恩从不说她的好话，也很少谈起自己的心迹。他实在太少言寡语了，但她倒不是很在意，因为她的话 滔滔不绝，要是他被她的哪个小幽默逗笑，就会把她乐翻了。但是他说起话来倒并不愚蠢，他只是非常地害羞。他好像是住在东方某地，现在在家休假。">查看中文翻译</div>
