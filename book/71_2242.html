<div class="line_en">Dantès stayed no longer than was necessary to take a breath, before diving once more: the first precaution that he had to take was to avoid being seen.</div>

<div class="line_en">Though stunned and almost suffocated, Dantès still had the presence of mind to hold his breath and since, as we have said, his right hand was prepared for any eventuality, holding the open knife, he quickly slit the cloth and put out his arm, then his head. But then, despite his attempts to raise the cannonball, he felt himself being continually dragged down, so he bent over to search for the rope restraining his legs and, with one last despairing effort, cut it just as he was suffocating. Kicking powerfully, he rose, free, to the surface of the sea, while the weight dragged the coarse linen that had almost become his shroud down into the unknown depths.</div>

<div class="line_en">When he emerged a second time, he was already at least fifty yards from the place where he had fallen. Above him, he saw a black, lowering sky, across which the clouds were being rapidly swept by the wind, from time to time revealing a small patch of blue from which a star shone. In front of him was a dark, roaring plain, its waves starting to seethe as at the approach of a storm; while behind him, blacker than the sea, blacker than the sky, like a threatening phantom, rose the granite giant, its sombre peak like a hand outstretched to grasp its prey. On the topmost rock was a lantern lighting two human forms.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他第二次浮起来的时候，他离第一次沉下去的地方已有五十步了。他看到天空是一片黑暗，预示着大风暴的来临，风在驱赶着疾驰的云雾，时而露出一颗闪烁的星星。在他的前面，是一片无边无际，阴沉可怕的海面，浪头吐着白沫，吼叫着，象是预示一次风暴的到来。在他的后面，耸立着一座比海更黑，比天更黑，象一个巨魔似的花岗岩，它那凸出的巉岩象是伸出来捕人的手臂。在那最高的岩石上，一支火炬照出了两个人影。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Now he must find his bearings. Of all the islands around the Château d'If, Ratonneau and Pomègue are the nearest; but Ratonneau and Pomègue are inhabited; so is the little island of Daume. The safest landfall was therefore on either Tiboulen or Lemaire, and these two islands lie a league away from the Château d'If.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="游泳的方向是必须确定的。兰顿纽和波米琪是伊夫堡周围最近的小岛，但兰顿纽和波米琪是有居民的，大魔小岛也是如此。狄波伦或黎玛最保险。这两个岛离伊夫堡有三哩路，邓蒂斯决定游到那儿去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It seemed to him that the two forms were bending uneasily over the sea: the strange gravediggers must indeed have heard the cry that escaped him as he flew through the air. So Dantès dived again and swam underwater for a considerable distance; he had once been quite used to doing this and would formerly, in the cove of the Pharo, have attracted many admirers around him, who often proclaimed him the most accomplished swimmer in Marseille.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他想这两个人是在望海，这两个奇怪的掘墓人肯定已听到了他的喊声。邓蒂斯又潜下去，在水下停留了一个很长的时间。这种动作他是做惯了的，他过去在马赛灯塔前的海湾游泳的时候，常常可以吸引许多观众，他们一致称颂他是港内最好的游泳家。">查看中文翻译</div>

But then, shining like a star, he noticed the Planier lighthouse. If he swam directly towards the light, he would leave Tiboulen a little to his left; so if he were to swing a small distance to the left, he would be heading for the island.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但他在黑夜里怎么能辨别方向呢？这时，他看到了伯兰尼亚灯塔象一颗灿烂的明星照耀在他的前面。假如这个灯光在右面，则狄波伦岛就在左面，所以他只要向左转就可以找到它了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Beneath the heavy, bitter swell, Dantès once more heard these words in his ears, and he hurried back to the surface to plough through the waves and test whether he had indeed lost his power. He was overjoyed to find that his enforced idleness had deprived him of none of his strength and agility, and to find that he was still master of this element in which he had gambolled as a child.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些话甚至在海浪的冲击下依旧在邓蒂斯的耳边响着。他加紧划水前进，看自己的体力有没有丧失。他很高兴地发觉牢狱生活并未夺去他的力量，他以前常常在海的怀抱里象一个孩子似的嬉戏，而他现在还是这方面的一个老手。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Often, in their prison, Faria had told the young man, when he saw him depressed and languid: "Dantès, you must not give way to this debility. If you do manage to escape and you have failed to keep up your strength, you will drown."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在狱中的时候，法利亚每见他露出怠倦懒惰的神色，就常常对他说：“邓蒂斯，你决不能老是这样无精打采。要是你不好好地锻炼你的体力，准备奋斗，你就是逃了出去，也会溺死的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In any event, fear, that swift tormentor, doubled his vigour. Rising on the crest of the waves, he listened to find out if he could hear any noise. Each time that he reached the highest point of a wave, he quickly surveyed the visible horizon and tried to penetrate the blackness. Every wave that climbed a little higher than the rest looked to him like a boat pursuing him, so he strove all the harder, which certainly took him further onward but also threatened to exhaust him more quickly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="恐惧是一个无情的追逐者，它倍增了邓蒂斯的力量。他侧耳倾听，看听不听得到什么声音。每一次浮出浪头时，他的目光就向地平线上搜索，努力在黑暗中望出去。每一个较高的浪头都象是一艘来追赶他的小船，于是他就加倍用力来增加他和小船之间的距离，但这样反复做了几次以后，他的气力渐渐衰弱了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">An hour passed, during which Dantès, buoyed up by the sense of freedom that had spread through his whole body, continued to drive on through the waves on the course he had set himself.</div>

<div class="line_en">The swimmer felt a shudder pass through him. He tried to float for a moment to give himself a rest, but the sea was getting heavier all the time, and he soon realized that such respite, which he had counted on having, was impossible.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他打了一阵寒颤。他想浮在海面上，休息一下，但海面波动得太猛烈，不能用这种方法来休息。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, so be it," he said. "I shall go on until the end… until my arms fail, until cramp seizes my whole body… and then I shall sink!" And he began to swim with the energy and urgency of despair.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，”他说，“我要游到精疲力尽为止，或是游到痉挛，那时就只好溺死了。”于是他拚着命地用力向前游。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Suddenly it seemed that the sky, already so dark, grew still darker and that a thick, heavy, impenetrable cloud was coming down over him. At the same time he felt a sharp pain in his knee. His imagination immediately told him that this must be the shock of a bullet and that he would instantly hear the report of a rifle; but there was no explosion. Dantès put out his hand and felt something. He brought up his other leg, and touched solid ground. It was then that he saw what it was he had taken for a cloud.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然间，他觉得天空似乎更黑更阴沉了，稠密的云块向他压下来，同时，他感到膝头发生一阵剧痛。他的想象力告诉他已中了一颗子弹，在一刹那间，他就会听到枪声，但他却什么都没有听到。他伸出手，觉得有东西挡住了他，于是他垂下脚去，踏到了地面，他那时才看清了自己错认为云的那个物体。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Now, let's see," he thought. "I have been swimming for almost an hour, but with a contrary wind I must have lost a quarter of my speed. However, unless I have mistaken the direction, I must now be close to the island of Tiboulen… But what if I am mistaken?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我来算算看，”他说，“我差不多已游了一个钟头了，但我是逆风游的，速度不免要减慢，但无论如何，要是我没有弄错的话，我离狄波伦岛一定很近了。但要是我弄错了呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Twenty yards ahead of him rose a mass of oddly shaped rocks that looked like a vast fire, solidified just at the moment when it was burning most fiercely. This was the island of Tiboulen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在他的面前二十码，耸立着一大堆奇形怪状的岩石，活象是经过了一场猛烈的大火以后所结成的东西。这就是狄波伦岛了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dantès, with his sailor's eye, had judged rightly. He had landed on the first of the two islands, which is Tiboulen. He knew that it was a naked rock, open to the elements and shelterless. When the storm was over, he would plunge back into the sea and make for the island of Lemaire, no less deserted but wider and consequently more welcoming.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓蒂斯没有弄错，他已到达了两个小岛中的第一个，这的确是狄波伦。他知道这个地方是草木不生，无处隐藏的，但要是海能稍微平静一些，他可以跳到波浪里，再游到黎玛岛去，那儿也和这儿一样的荒芜，但地方比较大，因此也较容易躲藏。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dantès stood up and took a few steps forward, then he lay down, thanking God, on these points of granite that seemed softer to him at that moment than the softest bed. Then, despite the wind, despite the storm, despite the rain that was starting to fall, exhausted as he was, he fell asleep with that delicious sleep of the man whose body is numbed but whose mind is awake to the knowledge of unhoped-for good fortune.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓蒂斯站起身来，向前走了几步，一面热烈地做了一个感恩的祷告，一面就直挺挺地在花岗石上躺下来，似乎觉得比睡在鸭绒上还更柔软。然后，也不管刮风下雨，他就象那些疲倦到极点的人那样沉入了甜蜜的睡乡。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After an hour, Edmond woke to the sound of an immense clap of thunder. The storm had broken in the heavens and was beating the air with its flashing flight. From time to time a shaft of lightning shot from the sky like a fiery snake, illuminating the waves and the clouds that plunged headlong after each other like the breakers of a vast abyss.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一小时以后，爱德蒙被雷声震醒。大风暴已脱了缰，正在以雷霆万钧之势奔驰，闪电一次接着一次，象一条浑身带火的赤炼蛇，飞过天空，照亮了那浑沌汹涌的浪潮卷滚着的云层。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">An overhanging rock did offer him some temporary shelter and he took refuge under it. At almost the same moment the storm broke in all its fury.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一块悬空的岩石给他作了暂时的躲避处，他刚躲到它下面，大风暴就又以万马奔腾之势发作了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Edmond felt the rock beneath which he was hiding tremble and the waves, breaking against the base of the huge pyramid, reached his hiding-place. Safe as he was, in the midst of this shattering noise and these blinding flashes of light, he was seized with a sort of dizziness. He felt as though the very island were shaking beneath him and, from one moment to the next, would break its moorings like a vessel at anchor and drag him down with it into the midst of the huge maelstrom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱德蒙觉得他身下的岩石都在震动，浪头凶猛地冲到花岗岩上，泼了他一身的浪花。他虽然很安全，却在这耀眼的雷电交战之中开始感到晕眩。他似乎觉得整个岛已在连根震动，象一艘下了锚的船在断缆以后那样被带入风暴的中心。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At this, he remembered that he had not eaten for twenty-four hours: he was hungry and thirsty. He stretched out his hands and his neck, and drank some rainwater from a hollow in the rock.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是他想起自己已有二十四小时没有吃喝了。他伸出手去，贪婪地捧饮着积贮在一个岩洞里的雨水。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As he was lifting his head, a shaft of lightning, which seemed to crack open the heavens as far as the foot of God's radiant throne, lit up the scene. By its light Dantès saw a little fishing boat appear, like a phantom slipping from the crest of a wave into the abyss, driven forward both by the waves and by the storm, between the Ile Lemaire and the Cap Croisille, a quarter of a league away from him. A second later the phantom reappeared on the crest of another wave, coming towards him at fearful speed. Dantès wanted to shout; he looked for a scrap of cloth that he could wave in the air, to show them that they were heading for destruction, but they could see it perfectly well for themselves. In the light of another shaft of lightning the young man saw four men hanging on to the masts and the rigging, while a fifth held the bar of a broken helm.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他站起身来的时候，正巧一道闪电，这一道闪电划破了天空，驱走了黑暗，直射到了上帝灿烂的宝座脚下。借着这道电光，邓蒂斯看到，在黎玛岛和克罗斯里岬之间，还不到一哩远的海面上，有一艘渔船，象一个魅影似的，正被风浪驱迫着疾驶。一秒钟以后，他又看到它，而且更近了。邓蒂斯用尽气力大喊，警告他们所处的危险，但他们自己也已发现这种危险。又一次闪电使他看到有四个人紧紧地抱住了折断的桅柱和帆索，而第五个人则紧抱着那破碎的舵。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Little by little, the wind subsided. Westwards across the sky rolled huge grey clouds which seemed to have been discoloured by the storm. Patches of blue sky reappeared with stars that shone brighter than ever. Soon, in the east, a long reddish band lit up the undulating blue-black line of the horizon. The waves danced and instantly a light sped across their crests; transforming each one into a mane of gold. Day was breaking.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="风渐渐息了，大块灰色的云片向西方卷去，蓝色的苍穹显露了出来，上面点缀着明亮的星星。不久，地平线上现出一道红色的条纹，波浪渐渐变成白色，一道光线掠到波浪上面，把吐着白沫的浪尖染成金黄色。白天来了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At the same time he heard a fearful crack and cries of agony. Grasping his rock like a sphinx above the abyss, Dantès glimpsed the little boat in the light of another flash, broken; amid its wreckage, heads with terrified faces and hands reached for the sky. Then darkness returned; the awful scene had lasted the lifetime of a lightning bolt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="同时，他听到一声猛烈的撞击声，痛苦的喊声也传进了他的耳朵。在岩石顶上的邓蒂斯借闪电的光看到那艘帆船碎成了一片片，在破片之中，又看到了面色绝望的人头和伸向天空的手臂。接着一切复归于黑暗。那副可怕的景象象闪电一样的短暂。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dantès hastened down the slippery rocks, at the risk of himself falling into the sea. He looked, listened, but could hear and see nothing: no more cries, no more human struggle. Only the storm, that great act of God, continued to roar with the wind and to foam with the waves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓蒂斯冒着粉身碎骨的危险奔下岩石。他侧耳倾听，尽力察看，但什么都听不到，什么都看不到。一切人类的呼声都已停止，只有风暴还独自在继续施威。">查看中文翻译</div>

Then they will find the hole and the tunnel. They will question the men who threw me into the sea, who must have heard me cry out. Immediately, ships full of soldiers will set out in pursuit of the unfortunate fugitive, who cannot have gone far. The cannon will be fired to warn everyone on the coast not to give shelter to any man who appears, naked and starving. The spies and alguazils of Marseille will be informed: they will search the coast while the governor of the Château d'If will be searching the sea. So, hunted down at sea, hemmed in on land, what will become of me? I am hungry and thirsty, I have even lost my life-saving knife, because it hampered me while I was swimming. I am at the mercy of the first peasant who wants to earn twenty francs by handing me in. I have no strength, no ideas, no resolve left. Oh, my God, my God! Haven't I suffered enough? Now, can you do more for me than I can do for myself?"</div>

Indeed, in all the years that he had been at the Château d'If he had forgotten it. He turned back to look at the fortress, sweeping his eyes across the whole arc of the land and the sea. The dark pile rose out of the midst of the waves with the imposing majesty common to all motionless objects which seem at once to watch and to command. It must have been about five o'clock. The sea was growing calmer all the time.</div>

<div class="line_en">Just as Edmond was uttering this ardent prayer, in a sort of delirium due to his exhaustion and the lightness of his head, and anxiously turning towards the Château d'If, he saw off the point of the Ile de Pomègue, its lateen sail against the horizon like a seagull skimming the waves, a little ship which only the eye of a sailor would have recognized as a Genoese tartan which appeared on the still indistinct line of the sea. It was coming from the port of Marseille and heading out to sea, driving the shining spray in front of a sharp prow that cut the sea ahead of its swelling sides.</div>

I can pretend to be one of the sailors from that little boat which sank last night. This is a plausible enough story. No one will be able to contradict me, since the whole crew is drowned.

<div class="line_cn" title="“但我不能了，我饿极啦。再过几小时，我的气力要一点都没有了，此外，或许堡里还未发现我已失踪了吧。我可以冒充昨天晚上沉船的一个水手。这个故事正巧合时，也不会有人来拆穿我。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As he said these words, Dantès looked towards the place where the little ship had foundered, and shuddered. The Phrygian cap of one of the drowned sailors was hanging from the jagged edge of a rock and near it some wreckage from the ship's hull was floating, dead beams that the sea drove against the base of the island which they hammered like powerless battering-rams.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓蒂斯一面说，一面向那渔船撞破的地方张望，这一望不由得使他吃了一惊。岩石尖上挂着一顶水手的红帽子，巉岩的脚下浮动着几块帆船龙骨的碎片。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">However, the ship and the swimmer were gradually converging. As it tacked in one direction, the little ship even came to about a quarter of a league from Dantès. He rose up in the sea and waved his cap as a distress signal, but no one on the ship saw him and it went about to begin tacking in the other direction. Dantès thought of calling out, but he assessed the distance and realized that his voice would not reach the ship, but would be carried away on the sea breeze and covered by the noise of the waves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="总之，帆船和游泳者已慢慢的在接近了，只要它再往岸边靠近一次，帆船就会接近到离他四分之一哩以内。他浮出到浪面上，做着痛苦求救的表示，但船上没有人看到他，船又折了一个弯。邓蒂斯本来可以大声喊叫，但他想到他的喊声会被风吞没。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He soon saw the tartan which, as it was sailing almost directly into the wind, was tacking between the Château d'If and the Tour de Planier. For a moment, Dantès was afraid that, instead of hugging the coast, the little ship would head out to sea, as it would have done, for example, had it been bound for Corsica or Sardinia. But from the way it was manoeuvring, the swimmer soon realized that it intended to pass between the islands of Jarre and Calseraigne.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱德蒙不久就发觉，那艘帆船因为正遇着顶头风，所以正在伊夫堡和伯兰尼亚灯塔之间抢风斜驶。在一刹那间，他怕那帆船会不沿岸航行，而径自驶出海去。但他不久就从它的行动上看出象大多数到意大利去的船只一样，它也想从杰罗斯屿和卡拉沙林屿之间通过。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Pretending that he was tired, Dantès asked if he could sit at the helm. The helmsman, delighted to be relieved of his job, looked at the master, who nodded to let him know that he could hand the bar over to his new companion. From this vantage point, Dantès could remain with his eyes fixed towards Marseille.</div>

<div class="line_en">A pained smile crossed his lips: he was wondering what had become of Mercédès during this time, when she must have thought him dead. Then a spark of hatred lit up in his eyes, when he thought of the three men who were responsible for his long, cruel captivity. And once more he vowed that same, implacable oath of vengeance that he had already taken in prison against Danglars, Fernand and Villefort.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个悲哀的微笑掠过他的脸。他自己问自己，美茜蒂丝不知究竟怎么样了，她一定以为他已经死了吧。接着他想到那三个使他囚居了这么久，使他受尽了这么多苦楚的人，他的眼睛里射出仇恨的光芒。他重新对邓格拉司，弗南和维尔福发了一个他在黑牢里发过的誓言，誓必要向他们作不共戴天的复仇。">查看中文翻译</div>
