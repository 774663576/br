<div class="line_en">They traveled dawn to dusk, past woods and orchards and neatly tended fields, through small villages, crowded market towns, and stout holdfasts. Come dark, they would make camp and eat by the light of the Red Sword. The men took turns standing watch. Arya would glimpse firelight flickering through the trees from the camps of other travelers. There seemed to be more camps every night, and more traffic on the kingsroad by day.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们黎明即起，经过森林、果园和平整的农地，穿越小村落、拥挤市镇，以及建筑坚固的庄园，赶路直到黄昏。入夜之后，他们扎营休息，就着“红剑”的光进餐。成年人轮班值守。透过树林，艾莉亚常瞥见其他旅人的营火晃动。夜间的营火似乎越来越多，白天里国王大道上的人潮也日渐汹涌。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Morn, noon, and night they came, old folks and little children, big men and small ones, barefoot girls and women with babes at their breasts. Some drove farm wagons or bumped along in the back of ox carts. More rode: draft horses, ponies, mules, donkeys, anything that would walk or run or roll. One woman led a milk cow with a little girl on its back. Arya saw a smith pushing a wheelbarrow with his tools inside, hammers and tongs and even an anvil, and a little while later a different man with a different wheelbarrow, only inside this one were two babies in a blanket. Most came on foot, with their goods on their shoulders and weary, wary looks upon their faces. They walked south, toward the city, toward King's Landing, and only one in a hundred spared so much as a word for Yoren and his charges, traveling north. She wondered why no one else was going the same way as them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不分昼夜，人们源源不绝地出现，有老有少，有大有小，有赤脚的女孩，还有怀抱婴儿的妇人。有人驾着马车，或是坐在牛拉的板车上颠簸行进，但更多的人骑乘动物：犁马、小马、骡子或驴子，只要能走能跑能打滚的都行。有个女人牵着一头奶牛，并把她的小女儿放在牛背上。艾莉亚看见一位铁匠推着轮车，车上装了他的全套工具：铁锤、火钳，甚至还有铁砧。没过多久，她又见另一人推着轮车经过，不过躺在里面的却是两个用毛毯包裹的小婴儿。多数人徒步，肩膀扛着家当，脸上挂着疲惫而警戒的神情。他们都向南去，朝着君临的方向，只有极少数人愿意跟北上的尤伦一行搭两句话。她不知为何无人与他们同路。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Many of the travelers were armed; Arya saw daggers and dirks, scythes and axes, and here and there a sword. Some had made clubs from tree limbs, or carved knobby staffs. They fingered their weapons and gave lingering looks at the wagons as they rolled by, yet in the end they let the column pass. Thirty was too many, no matter what they had in those wagons.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="旅人们多少都带着武器，匕首、短刀、镰刀和斧头，艾莉亚时而还看到有人配剑。还有的人把树枝削成棍棒，或做成粗手杖。他们经过时，这些人往往会摸着武器，把视线停留在马车上，但最终还是相安无事。马车上的东西再好，一次对付三十个人还是不好办。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The next morning, a sleek merchant on a grey mare reined up by Yoren and offered to buy his wagons and everything in them for a quarter of their worth. "It's war, they'll take what they want, you'll do better selling to me, my friend." Yoren turned away with a twist of his crooked shoulders, and spat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="翌日清晨，有个油腔滑调的商人骑着一匹灰母马，在尤伦面前停下，表示愿用四分之一的价值买下马车和上面所有的货品。“我说朋友啊，外面在打仗，他们抢了你东西可是不会给钱的，还不如把东西卖给我。”尤伦扭扭他的驼肩膀，别过头去，啐了一口。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Arya noticed the first grave that same day; a small mound beside the road, dug for a child. A crystal had been set in the soft earth, and Lommy wanted to take it until the Bull told him he'd better leave the dead alone. A few leagues farther on, Praed pointed out more graves, a whole row freshly dug. After that, a day hardly passed without one.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="同一天，艾莉亚发现路边有个小土堆，专用来埋葬小孩，这是他们上路以来见到的第一座坟墓。软泥堆上放了一颗水晶，罗米本想据为己有，但大牛要他别打搅死人。再往前走十里，普雷德发现了一整排新挖的坟墓。从那之后，他们每天都会发现新坟。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One time Arya woke in the dark, frightened for no reason she could name. Above, the Red Sword shared the sky with half a thousand stars. The night seemed oddly quiet to her, though she could hear Yoren's muttered snores, the crackle of the fire, even the muffled stirrings of the donkeys. Yet somehow it felt as though the world were holding its breath, and the silence made her shiver. She went back to sleep clutching Needle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有天夜里，艾莉亚突然惊醒，只觉一种莫名的恐惧。头顶，“红剑”与千颗繁星装饰着夜空。她虽听得见尤伦沉闷的打呼，营火的哔啪，甚至远处驴子的骚动，却觉得夜晚奇特地宁静，彷佛全世界都屏住了气息。这种静谧使她禁不住发抖，抓紧缝衣针，她才继续睡去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That evening they stopped in a village at an ivy-covered inn. Yoren counted the coins in his purse and decided they had enough for a hot meal. "We'll sleep outside, same as ever, but they got a bathhouse here, if any of you feels the need o' hot water and a lick o' soap."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当天傍晚，他们在村庄稍事休息，住进一个外墙爬满长春藤的旅店。尤伦数数钱包里的铜板，决定让他们吃一顿热餐。“咱们还是老规矩，晚上睡外面；不过这儿有间澡堂，你们要是想抹点肥皂洗个热水澡，就自己动手。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Come morning, when Praed did not awaken, Arya realized that it had been his coughing she had missed. They dug a grave of their own then, burying the sellsword where he'd slept. Yoren stripped him of his valuables before they threw the dirt on him. One man claimed his boots, another his dagger. His mail shirt and helm were parceled out. His longsword Yoren handed to the Bull. "Arms like yours, might be you can learn to use this," he told him. A boy called Tarber tossed a handful of acorns on top of Praed's body, so an oak might grow to mark his place.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天早上，普雷德没有醒来，艾莉亚方才明白，昨晚没听见的是他的咳嗽。于是他们也挖了个坟，把这位佣兵埋在他昨晚入睡的地方。入土之前，尤伦先把他身上值钱的东西都扒了下来。有人要了他的靴子，有人拿了匕首，锁甲和头盔也各归新主。尤伦特地把他的长剑交给大牛，对他说：“看你这双胳膊，大概可以学学用这个。”有个叫塔柏的男孩在普雷德的尸体上洒了把种子，这里以后便会长出一棵橡树，标记他葬身之地。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Washed and unwashed alike supped on hot pork pies and baked apples. The innkeeper gave them a round of beer on the house. "I had a brother took the black, years ago. Serving boy, clever, but one day he got seen filching pepper from m'lord's table. He liked the taste of it, is all. Just a pinch o' pepper, but Ser Malcolm was a hard man. You get pepper on the Wall?" When Yoren shook his head, the man sighed. "Shame. Lync loved that pepper."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="之后，洗澡和没洗澡的人都凑在一起吃热腾腾的猪肉派和烤苹果，旅店老板还额外请大家喝了一杯啤酒。“我有个弟弟也穿了黑衣，不过那是好多年前的事了。他本是个跑堂小弟，聪明得很哪，可惜有天他被人瞧见从大人桌上偷胡椒。唉，他就喜欢那味道，也就偷了那么一小撮，但马尔寇爵士是个严厉的人。你们长城那儿可有胡椒？”看尤伦摇头，老板便叹气，“可惜了，林克就好这口。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Arya did not dare, even though she smelled as bad as Yoren by now, all sour and stinky. Some of the creatures living in her clothes had come all the way from Flea Bottom with her; it didn't seem right to drown them. Tarber and Hot Pie and the Bull joined the line of men headed for the tubs. Others settled down in front of the bathhouse. The rest crowded into the common room. Yoren even sent Lommy out with tankards for the three in fetters, who'd been left chained up in the back of their wagon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然艾莉亚全身又酸又臭，味道跟尤伦一样难闻，她却不敢去洗。唉，住在她衣服里的好些东西可是从跳蚤窝一路跟着她呢，现在把它们淹死太也说不过去。塔柏、热派和大牛加入到排队洗澡的行列，他们在澡堂前停下来，其他人则全部挤进旅店大厅。尤伦还叫罗米拿了几大杯酒给那三个死囚，他们手脚上铐，被栓在车后面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Arya sipped at her tankard cautiously, between spoonfuls of pie still warm from the oven. Her father sometimes let them have a cup of beer, she remembered. Sansa used to make a face at the taste and say that wine was ever so much finer, but Arya had liked it well enough. It made her sad to think of Sansa and her father. The inn was full of people moving south, and the common room erupted in scorn when Yoren said they were traveling the other way. "You'll be back soon enough," the innkeeper vowed. "There's no going north. Half the fields are burnt, and what folks are left are walled up inside their holdfasts. One bunch rides off at dawn and another one shows up by dusk."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="艾莉亚一匙一匙地吃着热烘烘的派，不时小口啜饮杯中的啤酒。记得父亲以前偶尔会让他们喝一杯啤酒，珊莎喝了每次都会扮鬼脸，说葡萄酒比这好多了，但艾莉亚挺喜欢啤酒的味道。想到珊莎和父亲，她又难过起来旅店里都是往南走的人，大家一听说尤伦他们朝北去，顿时不屑之声四起。“走不出几步你就会回头，”老板发誓，“往北是不成的，田野给烧了大半，留下来的人全躲在庄园里。无法无天的家伙早上刚走一茬，晚上就又来一批。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The man in the green cloak said, "I heard how this hellbitch walked into a village one day… a market day, people everywhere, and she walks in bold as you please and tears a baby from his mother's arms. When the tale reached Lord Mooton, him and his sons swore they'd put an end to her. They tracked her to her lair with a pack of wolfhounds, and barely escaped with their skins. Not one of those dogs came back, not one."</div>

<div class="line_en">A she-wolf. Arya sloshed her beer, wondering. Was the Gods Eye near the Trident? She wished she had a map. It had been near the Trident that she'd left Nymeria. She hadn't wanted to, but Jory said they had no choice, that if the wolf came back with them she'd be killed for biting Joffrey, even though he'd deserved it. They'd had to shout and scream and throw stones, and it wasn't until a few of Arya's stones struck home that the direwolf had finally stopped following them. She probably wouldn't even know me now, Arya thought. Or if she did, she'd hate me.</div>
