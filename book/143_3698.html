<div class="line_en">Guiliano had not seen her for perhaps six months, and she had grown taller and slimmer in that time. She was tall for a Sicilian woman, with long legs that tottered on newly bought high-heeled shoes. She was only sixteen years of age, but her face and form had flowered in the subtropical earth of Sicily and she was a mature woman physically. Her hair was pulled into a jet black crown studded with three gemlike combs, exposing a neck as long and golden as that of an Egyptian woman on a vase. Her eyes were enormous, questioning; her mouth sensuous, yet the only part of her face that betrayed her extreme youth. She wore a white dress with a slash of red ribbon running across the front.</div>

<div class="line_en">Before the coming of Luca's army, when Guiliano could enter Montelepre as he pleased, he had often seen Justina Ferra. Sometimes she had come to the Guiliano house on an errand or to receive the money Guiliano gave to her parents. Guiliano had never really noticed her growing into a beautiful young woman until one day he had seen her on the streets of Palermo with her parents. They had gone into the city to buy finery for the Festa not available in the small town of Montelepre. Guiliano and members of his band had gone to Palermo to buy supplies.</div>

<div class="line_en">A month later, Guiliano found that his mind was obsessed with the memory of Justina Ferra standing in that pool of golden sunlight on the street in Palermo. He assumed it was merely sexual appetite, that he missed his passionate nights with La Venera. Then in his reveries he found himself not only dreaming of making love to Justina, but of spending time with her roaming around the mountains, showing her his caves, the narrow valleys filled with flowers, cooking meals for her over the open campfires. He still had his guitar in his mother's house and dreamed of playing for her. He would show her the poems he had written over the years, some of which had been published in the Sicilian newspapers. He even thought of sneaking into Montelepre and visiting her in her home, despite the two thousand soldiers of Colonel Luca's Special Force. At this time he came to his senses and knew something dangerous was going on inside him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个月之后，吉里安诺发现，尤斯蒂娜·费拉站在巴勒莫大街上、沐浴着金色阳光的形象依然萦绕在自己的脑际。他认为这仅仅是一种性的欲望，是他怀念与拉韦内拉在一起的激情夜晚。接着他就想入非非，不仅幻想着和尤斯蒂娜做爱，还幻想着花时间陪她在山里漫游，让她看那些藏身的洞穴，看那些开满鲜花的狭长山谷，并在篝火上为她做饭。他那把吉他还在母亲的房子里，他幻想着为她弹奏吉他。他愿意把这几年写的诗歌拿给她看，其中有一些已经发表在西西里的报纸上。他甚至想到置卢卡上校特种部队的两千人于不顾，悄悄潜入蒙特莱普雷，到她家里去找她。想到这里，他变得理智起来，他知道他正在孕育着一些危险的想法。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She was such a picture of loveliness that Guiliano stared at her for a long time. He was sitting in an open cafe, his men scattered at the tables around him, when she walked by accompanied by her mother and father. They saw him. Justina's father kept his face stony and made no sign of recognition. The mother glanced quickly away. Only Justina stared at him as she went by. She was Sicilian enough not to greet him, but she stared directly into his eyes and he could see her mouth quivering to restrain a smile. In the sun-drenched street she was a pool of shimmering light, of the sensual Sicilian beauty that blooms at an early age. Since becoming an outlaw Guiliano had always distrusted love. To him it was an act of submission and held the seed for a fatal treachery, but in that moment he felt what he had never felt before -- a suffusion in his body to kneel before another human being and willingly swear himself into an alien slavery. He did not identify this as love.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她简直就像画上的美人。吉里安诺盯着她看了好一会儿。她在父母陪同下从他眼前走过的时候，他正坐在一家露天餐馆，他的手下人分散坐在他四周的几张桌子旁边。他们三人都看见了他。尤斯蒂娜的父亲脸上没有表情，好像根本不认识他。她母亲赶紧把目光转向别处。只有尤斯蒂娜的眼睛一直在看着他。她不愧是西西里人，没有和他打招呼，但却一直注视着他的眼睛，他可以看出她的嘴唇在哆嗦，在抑制自己的微笑。在烈日炎炎的街上，她显得光彩照人。她是一个早熟的西西里性感美人。成为土匪之后，吉里安诺不再相信爱情。对他来说，爱是屈从于人的行为，孕育着致命的背信弃义的种子，但是这时候他却产生了一种从未有过的感觉——他的内心真想跪在一个人的面前，心甘情愿地发誓做这个人的奴隶。他并没有把这个看成是爱。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But it was merely his tactical mind that explored his options. He had already decided on his course of action. He would marry the girl. In secret. Nobody except her family would know and of course Aspanu Pisciotta and a few trusted members of his band. Whenever it was safe to see her, he would have her escorted into the mountains so that they could spend a day or two together. It would be dangerous for her to be the wife of Turi Guiliano, but he could arrange to have her sent to America, and she would be waiting for him when he made his escape there. There was only one problem. What did Justina think of him?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，这只是他在头脑中对这些选择进行的战术探究。他早就决定了自己的行动方案。他要和这个姑娘结婚。秘密结婚。除了她的家人，谁也不会知道。当然这不包括皮肖塔以及他手下几个可以信赖的成员。无论什么时候，只要能够安全地见到她，他就会派人把她护送到山上来，这样他们就可以有一两天时间待在一起。对于她来说，做图里·吉里安诺的妻子是很危险的，但是他可以安排把她送到美国去，让她在那里等他设法逃出去。只有一个问题：尤斯蒂娜对他是什么看法？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This was all foolishness. There were only two alternatives in his life. That he would be killed by the carabinieri, or that he would find sanctuary in America, and if he kept dreaming about this girl it would not be America. He had to get her out of his mind. If he seduced her or carried her off, her father would become his deadly enemy, and he had plenty of those already. He had once flogged Aspanu for seducing an innocent girl and over the years had executed three of his men for rape. This feeling he had for Justina was that he wanted to make her happy, to make her love and admire him and see him as he once saw himself. He wanted her eyes to be filled with love and trust.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一切都是胡思乱想。其实他的生活中只有两种选择，不是被宪兵打死，就是到美国去避难。如果他继续这样想入非非，那是去不了美国的。他必须把她从自己的头脑中清除出去。如果他勾引她或者把她带走，就会使她父亲成为他的死敌，而他的死敌已经够多的了。吉里安诺曾经因为阿斯帕努诱奸一个纯洁的女孩用鞭子狠狠地抽过他；这些年他的手下有三个人因强奸妇女被他处死。他对尤斯蒂娜的这份情感是想使她幸福，让她爱慕他，让她像他曾经看待自己的方式来看待他。他想让她的眼睛中充满了对他的爱和信任。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Caesero Ferra had been a secret member of Guiliano's band for the last five years, strictly as a gatherer of information, never in its operations. He and his wife had known Guiliano's parents and had been neighbors; they lived ten houses down the Via Bella from the Guiliano house. He was more educated than most of the people in Montelepre and was dissatisfied with farming. Then when Justina as a child had lost the money and Guiliano had replaced it and sent her home with the note that the family was under his protection, Caesero Ferra visited Maria Lombardo and offered his services. He gathered information in Palermo and Montelepre as to the movements of carabinieri patrols, the movements of rich merchants who were to be kidnapped by Guiliano's band, the identity of police informers. He received a share of the loot from these kidnappings and opened a small tavern in Montelepre, which also helped his secret activities.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡塞罗·费拉五年前就成了吉里安诺队伍的秘密成员，只进行情报收集工作，不参加他们的任何行动。他和他妻子了解吉里安诺的父母，而且是邻里，都住在贝拉大街上，离吉里安诺家只隔十幢房子。与蒙特莱普雷的大多数人相比，他受过比较多的教育，不甘心务农。尤斯蒂娜小时候把钱弄丢了，吉里安诺又给了她一份，而且还让她带回一张字条，说他们家将受到他的保护，所以卡塞罗·费拉去拜访了玛丽亚·隆巴尔多，并主动提出帮助吉里安诺。他在巴勒莫和蒙特莱普雷收集有关宪兵巡逻队的动向、吉里安诺准备绑架的富商的动向、向警察告密的人的身份特征等方面的情报。他也从这些绑架中得到一定的实惠，在蒙特莱普雷开起了一家小饭馆，这也有助于他收集情报。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When his son Silvio had returned from the war a Socialist agitator, Caesero Ferra ordered him out of the house. Not because he disapproved of his son's beliefs, but because of the danger to the rest of the family. He had no illusions about democracy or the rulers in Rome. He had reminded Turi Guiliano of his promise to protect the Ferra family and Guiliano had done his best to protect Silvio. And after Silvio was murdered, it was Guiliano who promised him that the murder would be avenged.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大战结束后，他儿子西尔韦奥退伍回家，成了一名社会主义的鼓动者，卡塞罗·费拉把他逐出了家门。这倒不是因为他不赞同儿子的信仰，而是因为怕他给家里的其他人带来危险。对于民主党和罗马的统治者，他都不抱幻想。他提醒图里要信守承诺，保护费拉一家，而吉里安诺则尽了最大的努力来保护西尔韦奥。西尔韦奥被杀害后，吉里安诺答应为他儿子报仇。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ferra had never blamed Guiliano. He knew that the massacre at Ginestra had profoundly disturbed Turi Guiliano, had caused him to grieve, that it still tormented him. He heard this from his wife who had listened for hours to Maria Lombardo talking about her son. How happy they had all been before that terrible day years ago when her son was shot down by the carabinieri and he had been forced against his better nature to kill in return. And of course every killing since then had been necessary, forced upon him by evil men. Maria Lombardo excused every killing, every crime, but she faltered when she spoke about the massacre at the Portella della Ginestra. Oh, the little children torn by machine-gun fire, the defenseless women killed. How could people think her son would do such a thing? Was he not the protector of the poor, the Champion of Sicily? Had he not given fortunes to help all the Sicilians in need of bread and homes? Her Turi could never have given the orders for such a massacre. So he had sworn to her on the statue of the black Madonna, and they had wept in each other's arms.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="费拉从来没有责备过吉里安诺。他知道吉里斯特拉的大屠杀彻底影响了图里·吉里安诺，让他非常悲伤，至今还感到痛苦。这是他听他妻子说的，因为玛丽亚·隆巴尔多跟她谈起过她的儿子吉里安诺，而且谈了好几个钟头。几年前的一天，她儿子遭到了宪兵的枪击，心地善良的他被迫还击，开了杀戒。当然，自那以后的每一次杀人都是迫不得已，都是被那些坏人逼的。玛丽亚·隆巴尔多对于每一次杀人和每一次犯罪都采取了原谅态度，可是当她谈到吉里斯特拉山口的屠杀事件时，就有些支支吾吾。哦，天真无邪的儿童被机枪子弹打死，手无寸铁的妇女惨遭杀戮。人们怎么能相信他儿子会做这样的事呢？难道他不是穷人的保护者，不是西西里的斗士了？难道他没有用劫来的财富帮助西西里所有挨饿的个人和家庭？她的儿子不可能下令进行这样的屠杀。为此，儿子曾在黑圣母像前对她发过誓，为此，母子二人曾抱头痛哭。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And so over the years Caesero had pursued the mystery of what had really happened at the Portella della Ginestra. Had Passatempo's machine-gunners made an honest mistake in the elevation of their fire? Had Passatempo, out of the sheer bloodthirstiness for which he was famous, slaughtered those people for his pleasure? Could the whole thing have been engineered to damage Guiliano? Was there perhaps even another band of men who had opened fire with their machine guns, men not under Guiliano's orders but perhaps sent by the Friends of the Friends or even by a branch of the Security Police? Caesero left nobody off his list of suspects except Turi Guiliano. For if Guiliano were guilty the whole world he lived in would collapse. He loved Guiliano as he had loved his son. He had seen him grow from a child to a man, and there had never been a moment when he had showed any meanness of spirit, any viciousness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些年来，卡塞罗·费拉一直在试图限免一个谜团：在吉里斯特拉山口究竟发生了什么？难道真的是帕萨藤珀的机枪手在射击的时候把仰角弄错了？难道真的是嗜血成性的帕萨藤珀为了一时的痛快而对这些人大开杀戒？整个事件会不会是有人故意策划来诬陷吉里安诺呢？用机枪扫射的会不会还有另外一拨人——这些人不是在执行吉里安诺的命令，而是由友中友或者警察部队派去的？除了对吉里安诺，卡塞罗没有排除对任何人的怀疑。因为如果吉里安诺是罪魁祸首，他所生活的这个世界就会崩溃。他喜欢吉里安诺，就像喜欢自己的儿子一样。他是看着他长大成人的，他从未表现出丝毫卑鄙或邪恶的念头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So Caesero Ferra kept his eyes and ears open. He bought drinks for other secret members of the band who had not been thrown into jail by Colonel Luca. He caught scraps of conversation among the Friends of the Friends who lived in town anc occasionally came to his tavern to drink wine and play cards. On one night he heard them talking laughingly about "The Animal" and "The Devil" visiting with Don Croce, and how the great Don had turned those two feared men into whispering angels. Ferra pondered on this and with that unerring Sicilian paranoia made the connection. Passatempo and Stefano Andolini had at some time met with the Don. Passatempo was often called "The Brute" and Fra Diavalo was Andolini's bandit name. What were they doing holding a private conversation with Don Croce at his house in Villaba, which was far from the bandits' mountain base? He sent his teenaged son to the Guiliano house with an urgent message and two days later was given a rendezvous in the mountains to meet with Guiliano. He told Guiliano his story. The young man showed no emotion and only swore him to secrecy. Ferra heard no more. Now three months later he received another summons from Guiliano and expected to hear the rest of the story.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以卡塞罗·费拉一直睁大眼睛看着，竖起耳朵听着。对于吉里安诺组织中那些没有被卢卡上校投进监狱的秘密成员，他请他们喝酒。从住在镇上、偶尔到他的小酒馆喝酒、打牌的友中友成员的交谈中，他听到一些只言片语。有一天晚上，从他们谈笑中，他听见他们说“野兽”和“魔鬼”与唐·克罗切进行过秘谈，以及克罗切是如何把这两个令人害怕的家伙变成了传播流言蜚语的能手。费拉陷入了沉思，借助西西里人准确的想象力展开联想。帕萨藤珀和斯特凡·安多里尼曾经和克罗切有过接触。帕萨藤珀常常被称为“野兽”，而“魔鬼修士”则是安多里尼当土匪的名字。他们到远离大山基地的维拉巴去，在唐·克罗切家里和他进行密谈，为的是什么呢？他让十来岁的儿子给吉里安诺家里送去一封急信，两天后他接到指令，要他到山里的一个接头地点去见吉里安诺。他把自己的想法告诉了吉里安诺。年轻人的脸上没有任何表情，只是叫他要绝对保密。他对费拉没有再说什么。现在，时隔三个月，吉里安诺再次要他上山，说他想听听这件事的下文。">查看中文翻译</div>

When he began to speak it was with the utmost respect. "I would rather have you for a husband to my daughter than any man in the world. And I know my son Silvio, God rest his soul, would agree with me." Again he stuttered when he spoke. "I worry only about my daughter's safety. If Justina was your wife, Colonel Luca would surely take any excuse to put her under arrest. The Friends are now your enemies and might do her some harm. And you must escape to America or die here in the mountains. I would not want her to be a widow so young, please forgive me for speaking so frankly. But it also complicates life for you and that worries me most. A happy bridegroom is not so aware of traps, he is not wary of his enemies. A marriage could cause your death. I speak so frankly only because of my affection and respect for you.

<div class="line_en">Guiliano sighed. "I've thought of all of those things. My plan is this. I would marry your daughter in secret. The Abbot Manfredi would perform the ceremony. We would be married here in the mountains. It would be too dangerous for me anyplace else. But I could arrange for you and your wife to accompany your daughter so that you could witness the marriage. She would stay with me for three days, and then I would send her back to your house. If your daughter becomes a widow she will have enough money to start a new life. So you need not fear for her future. I love your daughter and will cherish and protect her all of her life. I will provide for her future if the worst should happen.

<div class="line_en">Before he left, Ferra said he was happy that the information he had given had proven useful. And he was astonished at the change in Guiliano's face. The eyes seemed to open wider, the beauty of the face seemed to harden into white marble.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="费拉临走的时候说，他感到很高兴，因为他所提供的情报有价值。他很惊讶地发现吉里安诺的脸色突然阴沉下来。那双眼睛似乎睁得更大，那张英俊的脸似乎凝固成了白色的大理石。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I will invite Stefano Andolini and Passatempo to my wedding," he said. "We can settle the matter then." It only occurred to Ferra later that this was a curious thing to do if the marriage was to be kept secret.</div>

<div class="line_en">Caesero Ferra was immensely moved. The young man had spoken with such simplicity and directness. And with such wistful hope. But best of all he had been to the point. He had made provisions against the calamities of life and the future well-being of his daughter. Ferra rose from the table to embrace Guiliano. "You have my blessing," he said. "I will speak to Justina."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡塞罗·费拉极为感动。这个年轻人说话简明扼要，开门见山，而且满怀着希望。但最重要的是，他说得句句在理。为使他女儿能应对生活的磨难，为了她未来生活过得幸福，他作出了种种安排。费拉从桌子边上站起来拥抱吉里安诺。“我为你祝福，”他说，“我去跟尤斯蒂娜说。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In Sicily it was not uncommon for a girl to marry a man with whom she had never spent a moment alone. When the women sat outside their houses, those unwed had to sit always in profile, never staring full out into the street, lest they be called wanton. The young men going by would never get an opportunity to speak to them except at church, where young girls were protected by the statues of the Virgin Mary and their cold-eyed mothers. If a young man fell madly in love with the profile or the few words of respectful chatter, he had to put it in writing, in a well-composed letter declaring his intentions. This was a serious matter. Many times a professional writer was employed. The wrong tone might conceivably bring about a funeral rather than a marriage. And so Turi Guiliano's proposal through the father was not unusual, despite the fact that he had given Justina herself no sign of his interest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在西西里，一个姑娘结婚前从来没有和自己的男人单独在一起待过的情况并不少见。如果女人坐在自己家门外，没结婚的总是侧身而坐，眼睛从来不盯着大街看，否则就会被说成是轻浮。路过的年轻小伙子根本没有机会和她们搭话，但在教堂的时候情况就不同了，因为她们处于圣母玛利亚的神像和她们目光冷峻的母亲的保护之下。如果一个青年男子疯狂地爱上一个侧身而坐的姑娘，或者有几句倾心爱慕的话要说，就必须用文字写下来，写成一封像模像样的信来表达自己的心意。这是一件严肃的事情。很多人都雇请专业人士代笔，因为万一说错了话，结局可能就不是婚礼而是葬礼，这是可想而知的。所以图里·吉里安诺通过女孩的父亲求婚并非不正常，尽管他自己并没有直接向尤斯蒂娜表达过对她的爱慕。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Caesero Ferra was in no doubt about what Justina's answer would be. When she was a little girl she had ended her prayers with, "And save Turi Guiliano from the carabinieri. " She was always anxious to run messages over to the mother, Maria Lombardo. And then when the news had come out about the tunnel that ran to La Venera's house, Justina had been wild with rage. At first her father and mother had thought it was rage at the arrest of the woman and Guiliano's parents, but then they realized that it was jealousy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对于尤斯蒂娜会怎样回答，卡塞罗·费拉没有丝毫的疑问。她还是个小姑娘的时候，每次做祈祷她总要说一句“保佑图里·吉里安诺不受宪兵的伤害”。每次碰上给吉里安诺的母亲玛丽亚·隆巴尔多送信的事，她总是很积极。当通往拉韦内拉家有一条地道的消息传开之后，尤斯蒂娜简直气疯了。起初她父母亲还以为她是对那个女人和吉里安诺父母被捕的事感到愤怒，后来才意识到那是她的妒忌。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So Caesero Ferra could anticipate his daughter's answer; that was no surprise. But the way she received the news was a shock. She smiled wickedly at her father as if she had planned the seduction, as if she had known she could vanquish Guiliano.</div>

<div class="line_en">Deep in the mountains was a small Norman castle, almost in ruins, that had not been occupied for twenty years. Guiliano decided to celebrate his wedding and honeymoon there. He ordered Aspanu Pisciotta to establish a perimeter of armed men so the couple would be guarded against any surprise attack. Abbot Manfredi left his monastery in a donkey cart and then was carried in a litter over the mountain trails by members of Guiliano's band. In the old castle he was delighted to find a private chapel, though all its valuable statues and woodwork had long since been stolen. But the bare stones were beautiful, as was the stone altar. The Abbot did not really approve of Guiliano getting married, and after they had embraced he said jokingly to Guiliano, "You should have heeded the old proverb, 'The man who plays alone never loses.'"</div>

<div class="line_en">Aspanu Pisciotta, Stefano Andolini, Passatempo, Corporal Silvestro and Terranova were the only ones attending the wedding. Justina had changed from her traveling clothes into the white dress she had worn with such success in Palermo. She smiled at Guiliano, and he was stunned by the radiance of that smile. The Abbot made short work of the ceremony, and then they went out on the lawn of the castle where a table had been set with wine and cold meat and bread. They all ate quickly and drank a toast to the bride and groom. The trip back for the Abbot and the Ferras would be long and dangerous. There was anxiety that a patrol of carabinieri might wander into the area and the perimeter of armed bandit guards would have to engage them in battle. The Abbot wanted to be on his way quickly, but Guiliano detained him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Guiliano laughed and said, "But I have to think of my own happiness." And then added one of the Abbot's most beloved peasant sayings, which he always used to excuse his moneymaking schemes: "Remember, Saint Joseph shaved his own beard before he shaved the Apostles." This put the Abbot into a better humor, and he had his casket of documents opened and handed Guiliano his marriage certificate. It was a beautiful document, with medieval calligraphy written in gold ink.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉里安诺哈哈一笑说：“但是我也得考虑自己的幸福。”接着他又加了一句，“不要忘记，圣约瑟是先剃自己的胡须，然后才给使徒们剃的。”这是农民常说的话，院长很喜欢这句话并经常引用它替自己那些赚钱的计划开脱。吉里安诺这句话使院长情绪好了不少，他打开自己的文件箱，把结婚证书递给吉里安诺。这份证书制作精美，上面印的是烫金的中世纪花体字。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The bride and groom spent their nuptial night in the main bedchamber of the castle. This room had been stripped bare but Turi Guiliano had had a huge mattress brought in by donkey, with silken sheets and a goose-down quilt and pillows bought from the finest store in Palermo. There was a bathroom as huge as the bedroom with marble tub and a vast washing sink. Of course it had no running water and had to be supplied by buckets which Guiliano himself hauled in from the sparkling stream that ran beside the castle.

<div class="line_en">Naked, she was shy at first, holding her hands down between her legs. Her skin was golden. She was slim but with the full breasts of a mature woman. When he kissed her, she averted her head slightly so he touched only a corner of her mouth. He was patient, not with a lover's skill but with the tactical sense that had served him so well when he waged his guerrilla wars. She had let down her long jet black hair so that it screened her full breasts and he stroked her hair and talked about the first time he had seen her as a woman that fateful day in Palermo. How beautiful she had been then. He recited from memory some of the poems he had written about her when he was alone in the mountains and dreamed about her beauty. She relaxed in the bed, the goose quilt over her body. Guiliano rested on top of the cover, but she averted her eyes.</div>

Turi Guiliano had an extraordinary feeling of happiness listening to her tell this. That she loved him, that she thought and dreamed of him while he was alone in the mountains.

He started to shiver, and Justina threw back the goose quilt so that he could come into the bed with her.

But then she put her hand between his legs, very lightly, and he almost literally lost his senses. He made love to her with a fierce yet gentle passion and she returned his caresses, slowly, tentatively and then after a time with equal passion. They made love for the rest of the night without speaking except for short exclamations of love, and when dawn broke, Justina fell into an exhausted sleep.</div>

He never betrayed his wariness, and he had ordered his men to stay out of sight. But shortly after the gunfire Aspanu Pisciotta appeared with a brace of bloody rabbits over his shoulder. He threw them at Justina's feet and said, "Cook these for your husband, it's his favorite dish. And if you ruin them we have twenty more."

Passatempo had threatened that if Andolini said anything about this to Guiliano he would swear that Andolini had been in the room with Don Croce when the bargain was struck. Andolini had been too afraid to tell anyone except his father, the Abbot Manfredi. Manfredi had counseled him to keep his mouth shut.

<div class="line_en">Guiliano knew that Passatempo was like a wild animal -- he could sense changes in the atmosphere and the smell of danger as it came off other people. Guiliano was careful to behave exactly as he always had with Passatempo. He had always kept more of a distance between them than with the others. In fact he had assigned Passatempo and his band far away to control the area near Trapani, for Passatempo's savagery disgusted him. He used Passatempo to perform executions of informers and also to threaten stubborn "invited guests" until they paid their ransoms. Just the sight of Passatempo would usually frighten prisoners and shorten negotiations, but if that was not enough, Passatempo would tell them what he would do to them and their families if the ransom was not paid, and tell them with such relish that the "guests" would stop haggling to be released as quickly as possible.</div>
