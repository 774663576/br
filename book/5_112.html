<div class="line_en">By 2000, Kate rarely paused in the whirlwind chaos of her everyday life to wonder where the years had gone. Contemplation and reflection, like relaxation, were thoughts from another era, ideas from another life. The road not taken, as they used to say. A woman with three children -- a ten-year-old girl who was fast approaching puberty and twin boys under two -- simply didn't have time to think about herself much, and the number of years that separated her kids' ages created almost two families. She knew now why women had their children closer together. Starting over doubled a mother's exhaustion level.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到了2000年，凯蒂每天的生活都有如龙卷风过境，她再也没时间纳闷光阴流逝何方。回顾与反省成了属于另一段时光、另一段人生的东西，休息也是，就像人们常说的，是当初没有选的那条路。女儿十岁了，即将进入青春期，两个儿子还不满一岁，身为三个孩子的妈妈，她不可能有时间考虑自己，加上姐弟之间年纪差距太大，感觉像两个不同的家庭。一般女人都会将生育时间集中，她完全能体会为什么，从头来过感觉加倍疲累。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her days were consumed by details, and this surprisingly sunny morning in March was no exception. The chores stacked up, one on top of another, until she found herself running from sunrise to well past sunset. The crappy part was that she never seemed to accomplish anything substantial, yet she almost never had an hour to herself. The at-home mother's life: it was a race with no finish line. That was what they talked about in the carpool line as they waited for their kids to leave school. That, and divorce. Every month lately it seemed that one seemingly solid marriage had shown its crumbling clay foundation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的每一天都被各种小事吞噬，这个出奇晴朗的三月早晨也一样，杂务一件接着一件，从日出到日落她都在不停东奔西走。最可悲的是，她似乎没有任何实质的成就，却又连一个小时的私人时间也没有，家庭主妇的生活就是一场没有终点的赛跑。一群妈妈在接送区等小孩放学，聊的话题除了这个就是离婚，许多看似坚不可摧的婚姻，最近纷纷暴露出其实基底早已腐蚀崩坏。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Except today wasn't just another ordinary bead in the strand of her life. Today, Tully was coming to Seattle for a promotional tour. It would be the first time they'd seen each other in months, and Kate couldn't wait. She needed some girlfriend time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过今天并非平凡忙碌的另一天，今天塔莉要来西雅图宣传。她们好几个月没见面了，凯蒂等不及想与好友相聚，她需要闺密畅聊的时间。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She hurried through her To Do list -- dropped Marah off at school, spent too long at Safeway, bought all-new makeup at Rite Aid, made it to the library in time for reading hour, picked up Johnny's dry cleaning, got the boys down for their naps, and cleaned the house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她急匆匆完成所有事情：送玛拉上学，在超市大排长龙结账，去药妆店买新的化妆品，及时赶到图书馆说故事，去干洗店领回强尼的衣物，哄两个小的午睡，最后还要打扫。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">By two-thirty, as she pulled out of the carpool lane -- again -- she was exhausted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两点半，她再度来到学校接送区，整个人都快累瘫了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Aunt Tully's coming to spend the night tonight, right, Mommy?" Marah said from the backseat. She looked tiny, wedged in as she was between the boys' dump-truck-sized car seats.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“塔莉阿姨今天要来家里住，对不对，妈妈？”玛拉在后座问，夹在两个巨大的安全座椅中间，她显得非常娇小。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That's right."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Are you gonna wear makeup?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你要化妆吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Kate couldn't help smiling at that. She wasn't quite sure how it had happened, but somehow she'd raised a tiny beauty queen. At ten, Marah already had more fashion sense and style sensibility than Kate ever had. She watched in amazement as her tall, slim ten-year-old daughter poured over the teen fashion magazines and memorized designer names. School shopping was a terror. If Marah didn't find exactly what she wanted, she went ballistic. There was rarely any doubt in Kate's mind that her daughter was judging her appearance. More often than not, she knew she was found lacking. "I will definitely wear makeup. I'll even curl my hair, how's that?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯蒂忍不住笑了。她不太清楚怎么会这样，但她好像生了个小小爱美女王。玛拉虽然才十岁，但她对时尚非常敏锐，搭配衣服的眼光也很好，凯蒂一辈子都没那么厉害过。每次看到高挑苗条的十岁女儿抱着少女杂志背诵设计师的名字，凯蒂总是感觉很不可思议，不过每次开学买新衣服都是一场噩梦，要是玛拉找不到和预期中一模一样的款式，她就会哭闹使性子。凯蒂十分确定女儿开始为她的外表打分数，而她知道自己常常完全没打扮，“我当然会化妆，我甚至会上发卷，可以了吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Marah was out of the car and into the house before Kate had time to ask her to help carry stuff in. "Thanks for the help," she muttered, releasing her boys from the car seats. As toddlers, Lucas and William were wild separately; together they were a tornado.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛拉一转眼就下车跑进屋里，凯蒂来不及叫她帮忙拿东西。“多谢啦，真是帮了大忙。”她嘀咕着解开双胞胎的安全座椅，在这种学步的年纪，路卡和威廉各自都是疯狂的小捣蛋，凑在一起时更是凡走过必留下灾难。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For the next few hours, she did more afternoon chores: in addition to all the regular things, she arranged vases of flowers and placed them throughout the house, positioned and lit scented candles on dressers too high for the boys to reach, and thoroughly cleaned the guest room in case Tully decided she had time to say. Then, with dinner in the oven and the boys trailing along behind her, she went upstairs to get ready. As she passed Marah's room she could hear the patter of feet that meant her daughter was pulling one outfit after another from her closet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接下来几个小时，她迎战更多下午要处理的杂务，除了一般家事，她还插了几瓶花摆在各处装饰，点燃香氛蜡烛放在双胞胎碰不到的五斗柜上，接着彻底清理客房，以备塔莉临时决定留下来过夜。晚餐放进烤箱，双胞胎紧跟在她屁股后面，她上楼去梳妆打扮。经过玛拉的房间时，她听到赤脚跑来跑去的声音，这表示女儿正忙着把衣橱里的衣服一件件搬出来挑选。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Smiling, Kate went to her own room, parked the boys in the playpen, and, ignoring their screams, took a shower. When she finished drying her hair (trying not to notice how dark her roots were), she opened the bathroom door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯蒂微笑着回到房间，将双胞胎放进游戏围栏里，不理会他们的哭闹，径自去浴室洗澡。洗完澡，吹干头发（努力不去看深色的发根有多长），她打开浴室门。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In her closet, she sighed. Everything she owned was either out of date or too small. She still had some baby weight to lose -- the twins had turned her stomach into the Kingdome; that kind of stretching didn't bounce back easily.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="站在衣橱前，她不由得叹了口气。她的衣服不是过时就是穿不下。她怀孕时增加的体重还没减掉，双胞胎将她的肚子撑得像巨蛋，那种程度要缩回去不是简单的事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="运动绝对有帮助，她极度希望今年冬天能有时间去健身。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She chose a nice pair of her favorite broken-in Levi's and a pretty black angora sweater that Johnny had given her for Christmas a few years ago, right after he'd taken the job at KLUE. It was one of her only designer garments.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她选了心爱的抓破牛仔裤，搭配黑色安哥拉毛衣，这是几年前强尼送的圣诞礼物，当时他才刚回KLUE上班。这是她仅有的一件名牌服饰。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="现在想这些已经太迟了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Come on, boys," she said, scooping them up with practiced ease. Settling one on each hip, she carried them to their bedroom, changed their diapers, and dressed them in the darling sailor boy outfits Tully had sent for their birthday. Then, because it took forever to let them walk down the stairs, she carried them, plopped them on the living room floor with a pile of toys in front of them, and popped in a Winnie-the-Pooh tape. That gave her twenty minutes if she was lucky.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“来吧，你们两个。”她以熟练的动作轻松捞起双胞胎，一边一个靠在髋骨上抱回他们的房间，换好尿布，给他们穿上可爱的水手装——这是塔莉送他们的生日礼物。因为让他们自己走下楼太花时间，所以她再次抱起他们，到了客厅，她将双胞胎放在地上，找来一堆玩具，然后播放小熊维尼录像带。如果运气不错，这样应该能争取到二十分钟。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tully emerged slowly, as if she knew she was making an entrance. Dressed in low-rise designer jeans and a crisp white men's-style blouse beneath a navy blazer, she was the very definition of casual chic. Her hair, cut in layers and probably styled by the best hairdresser in Manhattan, was a gorgeous auburn hue that shone in the light from the garage.</div>

<div class="line_en">When Tully had exhausted the celebrity fashion topics, she turned to world politics. She and Johnny debated the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal and the press coverage of it in fierce detail; Marah jumped in at every lull with endless questions about teenage celebrities Tully knew personally and Kate had never heard of. Frankly, the boys were such a handful it took all of her concentration and effort to keep them quiet. Kate kept meaning to say something, add a comment or two, but the boys picked tonight to throw food at each other, and she had to be vigilant to keep them in check.</div>

How the hell am I supposed to do all that, make dinner, do the laundry, clean the house, and write a book at the same time?" She looked at them. "I know what you both think. What everyone seems to think. I'm supposed to make time to search for my authentic self.

In the years of their on again/off again relationship, they'd been all over the world together, attended dozens of glittering parties and black-tie charity events.

<div class="line_en">In her early thirties, it had been easy to keep up the schedule. Back then, she'd been able to work long hours, sleep all afternoon, party all night, and wake up looking and feeling great. But she was approaching forty now, and she was beginning to feel tired, a little old to be running from one job to the next, and in heels, no less. More and more often when she came home from work, she curled up on her sofa and called Kate or Mrs. M. or Edna. Being seen -- and photographed -- at the It new club or at some red carpet premiere had lost its appeal. Rather, she found herself longing to be with people who really knew her, really cared.</div>

<div class="line_en">For more years than she wanted to count, she'd lived this routine. Almost from her first day in New York, she'd been waking up at three-thirty A. M. for work. Success had only made long days longer. Since CBS had lured her over, she'd had to include afternoon meetings in addition to her morning broadcasts. Fame and celebrity and money should have allowed her to slow down and enjoy her career, but the opposite had occurred. The more she got, the more she wanted, the more afraid she was of losing it, and the harder she worked. Every job that came her way, she took -- narrating a documentary on breast cancer, guest-hosting a super new game show, even being a judge for the Miss Universe contest. And then there were her guest appearances on Leno, Letterman, Rosie, etc. And holiday parades that needed a grand marshal. She made sure no one could forget her.</div>
