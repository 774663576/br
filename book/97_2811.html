<div class="line_en">To add to the excitement, the fjord was filled with ships from other kingdoms, bringing dignitaries from far away. One by one, important people stepped onto Arendelle's docks.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Welcome to our humble Arendelle," the royal handler called to the visitors. One of the visiting dignitaries was the Duke of Weselton, a small man with white whiskers. Two huge guards followed close behind him, carrying his luggage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“欢迎来到敝国艾伦戴尔。”迎宾大臣向来访者表示欢迎。其中一位来访的贵族是威斯顿公爵，他身材矮小，留着两撇大白胡子。两名健壮的护卫提着公爵的行李，紧紧跟在他后面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On the morning of Elsa's coronation, the heavy gates to the castle were finally opened. All of Arendelle wanted to celebrate the grand occasion. The streets in front of the castle were crowded with townspeople eager to see the new queen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在加冕日的早上，城堡厚重的大门终于打开。整个艾伦戴尔王国都沉浸在庆祝的喜悦中。城堡前的街道挤满了国民，他们迫不及待地想一睹新女王的风采。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the distance, Kristoff was making his way down a mountain path. Now grown-up and strong, he and Sven had become true ice harvesters, masters at hauling ice blocks down the mountain. To Kristoff, the coronation was a perfect opportunity to sell ice to the crowds who filled Arendelle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="远处，克斯托夫正沿着山路往山下走。如今他已长成了高大魁梧的小伙子，他和斯特也成了真正的采冰人，是采冰运冰的行家了。对于克斯托夫而言，加冕典礼是一个千载难逢的好机会，可以向这熙熙攘攘的人群售卖冰块。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Ah, Arendelle, our most mysterious trade partner," the Duke said breezily. "Open those gates so I may unlock your secrets and exploit your riches!"</div>

<div class="line_en">The reindeer raised his eyebrows. Sven couldn't talk, but that wasn't a problem for Kristoff. He often spoke for Sven, changing his voice to sound deeper and more reindeer-y.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="驯鹿挑了挑眉。斯特虽然不能说话，但这对克斯托夫来说不是问题。他经常压低嗓音，以斯特的口吻说话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"A coronation on a hot July day, you know what that means?" he asked Sven, who was harnessed to their rickety ice cart.</div>

<div class="line_en">For Anna, the new people and the excitement were a dream come true. For the first time in years, every door in Arendelle was open. No one was shutting her out! She burst through the busy courtyard in front of the castle and practically skipped into town. People everywhere were getting ready for the coronation. She saw banners, a maypole, and flowers -- all celebrating her sister, the new queen. There were dancing groups, musical bands, and food stalls. Everything looked so interesting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对于安娜来说，见到这么多新鲜的面孔，参加热闹的庆典就像梦想成真一样。这么多年来，艾伦戴尔第一次打开了每一扇门。没人将她拒之门外！她穿过城堡前面热闹的花园，一蹦一跳地溜进了城里。所有人都为加冕仪式做好了准备。她所到之处，尽是彩旗、花柱和鲜花——都在庆祝她姐姐成为新女王。有舞蹈团、乐队和卖美食的小摊，一切看上去都有趣极了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, you will," Kristoff said, talking normally again. He grinned. "But also, people will be needing ice. Lots of ice." He pulled Sven's rope, and the two continued down into the town.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，肯定会这样。”克斯托夫又恢复了正常的语气，他呵呵地笑了。“人们到时候会需要冰块，很多冰块。”他拉着斯特的绳子，继续向城里走去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I sure do, Kristoff," he declared, as Sven. "By noon I'm going to smell like a barrel of rabid skunks."</div>

<div class="line_en">As a test, she slipped off her gloves and picked up a candlestick and a little jar from the table. She concentrated, holding both with her bare hands. "Be the good girl," Elsa whispered to herself. "Make one wrong move and everyone will know…" She was nervous. As she stood there, ice formed on her palms and moved onto the objects, turning them to ice. She hurriedly dropped them and tugged her gloves back on, concealing her hands -- and her icy magic.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她试着脱下手套，从桌上拿起一个烛台和一只小罐。她聚精会神，徒手拿着这两样东西。“好好的，”艾莎自言自语道，“一步出错，所有人就会知道…”她很紧张。她站在那里，手掌上开始结冰，冰雪慢慢转移到手里的东西上，快把它们冻住了。她急忙丢下东西，重新戴上手套，极力把双手隐藏起来，当然，还有她的冰雪魔力。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In her room upstairs in the castle, Elsa did not share the happiness that pulsed through the kingdom. She worried about controlling her powers, and hoped she could just get through the ceremony without anyone learning about her magic.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在城堡楼上的房间里，艾莎并没有感受到弥漫在整个王国里的快乐气氛。她担心自己控制不了魔力，一心只希望能够顺利完成庆典，而不被任何人发现她的魔力。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's only for today," Elsa reminded herself. After that, the gates would be closed again and she could go back into hiding.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“就这一天。”艾莎不断提醒自己。以后，城门又会关闭，她就可以像以前那样隐居。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I can't wait to meet everyone!" Anna exclaimed out loud. Then she stopped short as a thought occurred to her. "What if I meet the one?" Anna knew she wasn't likely to meet someone special, especially since the castle gates would be open for one day only, exactly twenty-four hours. Still, she couldn't help daydreaming just a bit. Today might be her only chance to meet new friends, have new experiences, and maybe, just maybe, find love.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我迫不及待地想要见所有人！”安娜兴奋地喊道。这时她突然停了一下，脑中闪过一个念头。“如果遇到命中注定的那个人将会怎么样？”安娜知道不会见到什么特殊人物，尤其因为城堡大门只开放一天，仅仅24小时。然而，她还是不禁浮想联翩。今天也许是她唯一的机会去认识新朋友，体验新事物，又或许，仅仅是或许还可以找到真爱。">查看中文翻译</div>
