<div class="line_en">"No one wants rain," said Cersei. For herself, she wanted sleet and ice, howling winds, thunder to shake the very stones of the Red Keep. She wanted a storm to match her rage. To Jocelyn she said, "Tighter. Cinch it tighter, you simpering little fool."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没人想下雨。”瑟曦答道。就自己而言，她要的是冰雹大雪，狂风呼啸，雷霆万钧，将红堡砸个粉碎，她要一场足以体现她怒气的风暴。但她对乔斯琳说的却是，“紧点，再收紧点，你这只会傻笑的小白痴。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was the wedding that enraged her, though the slow-witted Swyft girl made a safer target. Tommen's hold upon the Iron Throne was not secure enough for her to risk offending Highgarden. Not so long as Stannis Baratheon held Dragonstone and Storm's End, so long as Riverrun continued in defiance, so long as ironmen prowled the seas like wolves. So Jocelyn must needs eat the meal Cersei would sooner have served to Margaery Tyrell and her hideous wrinkled grandmother.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="婚礼让她怒火万丈，弱智的史威佛女孩因而成了发泄对象。没办法，为了托曼的王位巩固，她不敢冒犯高庭——只要史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩还盘踞着龙石岛与风息堡，只要奔流城还在负隅顽抗，只要铁民还虎视眈眈地横行于海洋，她就不敢这么做。只能由乔斯琳来忍受瑟曦对玛格丽·提利尔和她那丑恶祖母的轻蔑了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">To break her fast the queen sent to the kitchens for two boiled eggs, a loaf of bread, and a pot of honey. But when she cracked the first egg and found a bloody half-formed chick inside, her stomach roiled. "Take this away and bring me hot spiced wine," she told Senelle. The chill in the air was settling in her bones, and she had a long nasty day ahead of her.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Suppose he was," said Jaime. "Whatever plans he makes, he will still be small and stunted. Tommen will be surrounded by the finest knights in Westeros. The Kingsguard will protect him."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Safe." The word tasted bitter on her tongue. Jaime did not understand. No one understood. Only Melara had been in the tent to hear the old hag's croaking threats, and Melara was long dead. "Tyrion will not kill the same way twice. He is too cunning for that. He could be under the floor even now, listening to every word we say and making plans to open Tommen's throat."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“绝对安全。”这个词让她万分苦涩。詹姆不懂，谁都不懂。只有梅拉雅在那个帐篷里和她一起听过老巫婆嘶哑的诅咒，而梅拉雅早死了。“提利昂不会再下毒，他太狡猾，同样的招数不会使用两次。此时此刻，他很可能就藏在地板下面，听着我们说的每句话，然后计划好如何割托曼的喉咙。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Nor did Jaime help her mood when he turned up all in white and still unshaven, to tell her how he meant to keep her son from being poisoned. "I will have men in the kitchens watching as each dish is prepared," he said. "Ser Addam's gold cloaks will escort the servants as they bring the food to table, to make certain no tampering takes place along the way. Ser Boros will be tasting every course before Tommen puts a bite into his mouth. And if all that should fail, Maester Ballabar will be seated in the back of the hall, with purges and antidotes for twenty common poisons on his person. Tommen will be safe, I promise you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="连詹姆也没给她带来好心情。弟弟全身白甲，依然没刮胡子，他保证她儿子不会再被毒害。“我派人去厨房，监督每道工序，”他解释，“亚当爵士的金袍子则负责监视每个上菜的仆人，确保从厨房到大厅途中决无意外发生。柏洛斯爵士将在托曼用餐之前先行尝试——如果一切预防措施终归无效，还有巴拉拔学士，他坐在大厅背后，随身带着清肠剂和二十味剧毒的解药。总之，我向你保证，托曼他绝对安全。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"As will you. I command it, in the king's name." Cersei had not wanted Tommen and his wife to share a bed at all, but the Tyrells had insisted. "Husband and wife should sleep together," the Queen of Thorns had said, "even if they do no more than sleep. His Grace's bed is big enough for two, surely." Lady Alerie had echoed her good-mother. "Let the children warm each other in the night. It will bring them closer. Margaery oft shares her blankets with her cousins. They sing and play games and whisper secrets to each other when the candles are snuffed out."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“还有你，以国王的名义，我命令你必须在场。”事实上，瑟曦根本不想让托曼和他的妻子同床共枕，但提利尔家非常坚持这点。“丈夫妻子当然得睡在一起，”荆棘女王如是宣称，“即便他们俩除了睡觉别的不会做也罢。自然喽，国王陛下的床铺应该睡得下两个人吧？”艾勒莉夫人应和她丈母娘，“就让孩子们在夜里彼此温暖吧，这会让他们之间更为亲密。您知道，玛格丽经常邀请她的表亲与她同睡，当蜡烛熄灭之后，她们一起唱歌、玩游戏、低声倾诉小秘密呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“若他们还在塔内，早给发现了。我派士兵拿着铁镐和铁锤进去搜查，敲开墙壁，凿穿地板，发现了好几十条秘密通道。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And for all you know there may be half a hundred more." Some of the secret crawlways had turned out to be so small that Jaime had needed pages and stableboys to explore them. A passage to the black cells had been found, and a stone well that seemed to have no bottom. They had found a chamber full of skulls and yellowed bones, and four sacks of tarnished silver coins from the reign of the first King Viserys. They had found a thousand rats as well… but neither Tyrion nor Varys had been amongst them, and Jaime had finally insisted on putting an end to the search. One boy had gotten stuck in a narrow passage and had to be pulled out by his feet, shrieking. Another fell down a shaft and broke his legs. And two guardsmen vanished exploring a side tunnel. Some of the other guards swore they could hear them calling faintly through the stone, but when Jaime's men tore down the wall they found only earth and rubble on the far side. "The Imp is small and cunning. He may still be in the walls. If he is, the fire will smoke him out."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你明知道也许还有几十条没发现的！”事实上，有的通道如此狭小，詹姆只能派小侍酒或马童爬进去探索。他们找到一条直通黑牢的地道，一口犹如无底深渊的石井，有一个房间堆满了头骨与焦黄的骨骸，外加四大口袋来自于韦赛里斯一世时期、已然失去光泽的银币。他们还遇到了上千只老鼠…但既没找到提利昂，更没发现瓦里斯的踪迹，詹姆最终决定停止无益的行动。期间，一个男孩曾被一条狭窄的通道卡住，费尽辛苦才拖出来；另一个男孩从天梯上摔下去，摔断了腿；还有两名卫兵在探索某条岔道时双双失踪，其他卫兵声称隔着石墙听到微弱的呼喊，但等詹姆派人推翻墙壁，对面唯有泥土和碎石而已。“小恶魔是个狡猾的小怪物，他很可能还躲在墙里面，烟火能把他熏出来现身。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Would that we could do the same to the rest of this foul castle," said Cersei. "After the war I mean to build a new palace beyond the river." She had dreamed of it the night before last, a magnificent white castle surrounded by woods and gardens, long leagues from the stinks and noise of King's Landing. "This city is a cesspit. For half a groat I would move the court to Lannisport and rule the realm from Casterly Rock."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“把这座肮脏的城堡全砸碎就好了。”瑟曦宣称，“战争结束之后，我打算在河边新修宫殿。”昨晚她还在梦想这个，那将是一座雄伟的白城堡，周围有树林与花园环绕，远离君临的喧嚣和臭气。“这座城市就像个大粪坑，若条件允许，我宁愿把宫廷搬到兰尼斯港，在凯岩城治理国家。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“这比烧毁首相塔的愚行更蠢。听着，只要托曼还坐在铁王座上，全国的人心向背就会把他当做真正的国王；如果将他藏在岩石底下，他便成了觊觎王位的地方诸侯，和史坦尼斯同一级别。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Compared to the magnificence of Joffrey's nuptials, the wedding of King Tommen was a modest affair, and small. No one wanted another lavish ceremony, least of all the queen, and no one wanted to pay for one, least of all the Tyrells.

He recited his vows in a high, childish voice, promising his love and devotion to Mace Tyrell's twice-widowed daughter.

<div class="line_en">When it was time for the changing of the cloaks, the bride sank gracefully to her knees and Tommen covered her with the heavy cloth-of-gold monstrosity that Robert had cloaked Cersei in on their own wedding day, with the crowned stag of Baratheon worked upon its back in beads of onyx. Cersei had wanted to use the fine red silk cloak Joffrey had used. "It was the cloak my lord father used when he wed my lady mother," she explained to the Tyrells, but the Queen of Thorns had balked her in that as well. "That old thing?" the crone had said. "It looks a bit threadbare to me… and dare I say, unlucky? And wouldn't a stag be more fitting for King Robert's trueborn son? In my day a bride donned her husband's colors, not his lady mother's."</div>

<div class="line_en">When all the vows were spoken, the king and his new queen stepped outside the sept to accept congratulations. "Westeros has two queens now, and the young one is as beautiful as the old one," boomed Lyle Crakehall, an oaf of a knight who oft reminded Cersei of her late and unlamented husband. She could have slapped him. Gyles Rosby made to kiss her hand, and only succeeded in coughing on her fingers. Lord Redwyne kissed her on one cheek and Mace Tyrell on both. Grand Maester Pycelle told Cersei that she had not lost a son, but rather gained a daughter. At least she was spared Lady Tanda's tearful embraces. None of the Stokeworth women had appeared, and for that much the queen was grateful.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="誓词说完后，国王和王后走出圣堂，接受祝贺。“看哪！现在有两位美人戴上了维斯特洛的后冠，无论年轻的还是年长的，都是绝世容颜。”李勒·克雷赫爵士呼喝道——这是个莽夫、呆子，跟她前夫一个德行。两顶后冠？她真想给他一巴掌。盖尔斯·罗斯比想吻她的手，结果把她的指头当成了咳嗽用的方巾；雷德温伯爵吻了她一边脸颊，梅斯·提利尔吻了两边；派席尔大学士告诉她她不是失去了一个儿子，而是多了一个女儿；欣慰的是，她避免了坦妲伯爵夫人热情的拥抱——史铎渥斯堡的三个女人齐齐缺席，太后为此甚是感激。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Thanks to Stannis and his filthy letter, there were already too many rumors concerning Tommen's parentage. Cersei dared not fan the fires by insisting that he drape his bride in Lannister crimson, so she yielded as gracefully as she could. But the sight of all that gold and onyx still filled her with resentment. The more we give these Tyrells, the more they demand of us.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="该死，由于史坦尼斯和他下流的指控信件，现在王国上下传遍了关于托曼身世的谣言。瑟曦不能因为坚持使用兰尼斯特的绯红色从而为这事火上浇油，所以她尽可能保持尊严地退让了。现下看到这件玛瑙装饰的金色斗篷，太后不禁怒从中来。不识好歹的提利尔们，真爬树上墙了！">查看中文翻译</div>

The nearby town of Saltpans had been savagely raided by a band of outlaws, and some of the survivors claimed a roaring brute in a hound's head helm was amongst the raiders.

Lady Alerie had made all the arrangements; Cersei had not had the stomach to face that daunting task again, after the way Joffrey's wedding had ended. Only seven courses were served. Butterbumps and Moon Boy entertained the guests between dishes, and musicians played as they ate. They listened to pipers and fiddlers, a lute and a flute, a high harp. The only singer was some favorite of Lady Margaery's, a dashing young cock-a-whoop clad all in shades of azure who called himself the Blue Bard. He sang a few love songs and retired. "What a disappointment," Lady Olenna complained loudly. "I was hoping for 'The Rains of Castamere.'"</div>

<div class="line_en">Cersei glanced past Tommen, to where Margaery sat laughing with her father. She is pretty enough, she had to admit, but most of that is youth. Even peasant girls are pretty at a certain age, when they are still fresh and innocent and unspoiled, and most of them have the same brown hair and brown eyes as she does. Only a fool would ever claim she was more beautiful than I. The world was full of fools, however. So was her son's court.</div>

<div class="line_en">Whenever Cersei looked at the old crone, the face of Maggy the Frog seemed to float before her eyes, wrinkled and terrible and wise. All old women look alike, she tried to tell herself, that's all it is. In truth, the bent-back sorceress had looked nothing like the Queen of Thorns, yet somehow the sight of Lady Olenna's nasty little smile was enough to put her back in Maggy's tent again. She could still remember the smell of it, redolent with queer eastern spices, and the softness of Maggy's gums as she sucked the blood from Cersei's finger. Queen you shall be, the old woman had promised, with her lips still wet and red and glistening, until there comes another, younger and more beautiful, to cast you down and take all that you hold dear.</div>

<div class="line_en">Cersei drank several cups of wine and pushed her food around a golden plate. Jaime ate even less, and seldom deigned to occupy his seat upon the dais. He is as anxious as I am, the queen realized as she watched him prowl the hall, twitching aside the tapestries with his good hand to assure himself that no one was hiding behind them. There were Lannister spearmen posted around the building, she knew. Ser Osmund Kettleblack guarded one door, Ser Meryn Trant the other. Balon Swann stood behind the king's chair, Loras Tyrell behind the queen's. No swords had been allowed inside the feast save for those the white knights bore.</div>

<div class="line_en">Her mood was not improved when Mace Tyrell arose to lead the toasts. He raised a golden goblet high, smiling at his pretty little daughter, and in a booming voice said, "To the king and queen!" The other sheep all baaaaaaed along with him. "The king and queen!" they cried, smashing their cups together. "The king and queen!" She had no choice but to drink along with them, all the time wishing that the guests had but a single face, so she could throw her wine into their eyes and remind them that she was the true queen. The only one of Tyrell's lickspittles who seemed to remember her at all was Paxter Redwyne, who rose to make his own toast, swaying slightly. "To both our queens!" he chirruped. "To the young queen and the old!"</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我明白了。”在寒冷的走廊里，太后闻到密尔女人身上的香味，那是麝香的气息，混合了苔藓、泥土和野花的味道，而在这些味道下面，她嗅出勃勃野心。她在提利昂的审判上作过证，瑟曦突然想起，她亲眼看见小恶魔将毒药放进小乔的杯子里，而且有勇气说出口。“此事我会仔细调查，”太后承诺，“若你所言不假，一定重重有赏。”若你敢欺骗我，我就拔掉你的舌头，还要剥夺你丈夫的领地与财产。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Fool. No one who wears a crown is ever safe." She looked about the hall. Mace Tyrell laughed amongst his knights. Lords Redwyne and Rowan were talking furtively. Ser Kevan sat brooding over his wine at the back of the hall, whilst Lancel whispered something to a septon. Senelle was moving down the table, filling the cups of the bride's cousins with wine as red as blood. Grand Maester Pycelle had fallen asleep. There is no one I can rely upon, not even Jaime, she realized grimly. I will need to sweep them all away and surround the king with mine own people.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“笨蛋，戴上王冠的人永远不会安全。”她扫视大厅：梅斯·提利尔正和他的骑士们谈笑风生；雷德温伯爵和罗宛伯爵在窃窃私语；凯冯爵士在大厅后面就着一杯酒默默思考，而蓝赛尔正跟一位修士说着什么；塞蕾娜在席间服务，她满上新娘的一位表亲的杯子，酒液殷红如血；派席尔大学士睡着了。这里我谁都不能依靠，即便唐姆也不行，她阴沉地意识到，我要把他们统统换掉，国王驾前应该都是我的亲信。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Later, after sweets and nuts and cheese had been served and cleared away, Margaery and Tommen began the dancing, looking more than a bit ridiculous as they whirled about the floor. The Tyrell girl stood a good foot and a half taller than her little husband, and Tommen was a clumsy dancer at best, with none of Joffrey's easy grace. He did his earnest best, though, and seemed oblivious to the spectacle he was making of himself. And no sooner was Maid Margaery done with him than her cousins swooped in, one after the other, insisting that His Grace must dance with them as well. They will have him stumbling and shuffling like a fool by the time they're done, Cersei thought resentfully as she watched. Half the court will be laughing at him behind his back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随着甜品、干果和奶酪上桌又被清掉，玛格丽与托曼开始跳舞。他俩在席间旋身的模样，颇有几分荒谬可笑。提利尔女孩比她的小丈夫足足高了一尺半，而托曼原本不擅舞技，没有乔佛里的优雅灵巧。不过，他还是竭尽全力，不在乎失误多少。等这所谓的“处女”玛格丽跟他跳完，她的表亲又轮番上前，缠着要陛下也与她们跳。她们是故意的，故意用车轮战耗尽托曼的体力，好让他步履踉跄，在群臣面前出丑，瑟曦一边目不转睛地盯着儿子，一边愤恨地想，半个宫廷都在国王背后指指戳戳。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Whilst Alla, Elinor, and Megga took their turns with Tommen, Margaery took a turn around the floor with her father, then another with her brother Loras. The Knight of Flowers was in white silk, with a belt of golden roses about his waist and a jade rose fastening his cloak. They could be twins, Cersei thought as she watched them. Ser Loras was a year older than his sister, but they had the same big brown eyes, the same thick brown hair falling in lazy ringlets to their shoulders, the same smooth unblemished skin. A ripe crop of pimples would teach them some humility. Loras was taller and had a few wisps of soft brown fuzz on his face, and Margaery had a woman's shape, but elsewise they were more alike than she and Jaime. That annoyed her too.</div>

The other cousin, Elinor, was sharing a cup of wine with the handsome young Bastard of Driftmark, Aurane Waters. It was not the first time the queen had made note of Waters, a lean young man with grey-green eyes and long silver-gold hair. The first time she had seen him, for half a heartbeat she had almost thought Rhaegar Targaryen had returned from the ashes. It is his hair, she told herself. He is not half as comely as Rhaegar was. His face is too narrow, and he has that cleft in his chin. The Velaryons came from old Valyrian stock, however, and some had the same silvery hair as the dragonkings of old.</div>

What do they have to talk about? The Reach might call Ser Garlan gallant, but she trusted him no more than Margaery or Loras. She had not forgotten the gold coin that Qyburn had discovered beneath the gaoler's chamber pot. A golden hand from Highgarden. And Margaery is spying on me.

Yet even ruined and slighted, it loomed above the outer ward. As the wedding guests filed out of the Small Hall, they passed beneath its shadow. When Cersei looked up she saw the tower's crenellated battlements gnawing at a hunter's moon, and wondered for a moment how many Hands of how many kings had made their home there over the past three centuries.</div>
