<div class="line_en">In the years that followed, up to his eleventh or twelfth year when he could no longer travel on half fares, Eugene voyaged year by year into the rich mysterious South. Eliza, who, during her first winter at Dixieland, had been stricken by severe attacks of rheumatism, induced partly by kidney trouble, which caused her flesh to swell puffily, and which was diagnosed by the doctor as Blight's Disease, began to make extensive, although economical, voyages into Florida and Arkansas in search of health and, rather vaguely, in search of wealth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后来的几年里，一直到他十一二岁不能再买半票之前，尤金每年还总要到神秘而又富庶的南方去旅行一次。刚到南都旅馆的第一个冬天，伊丽莎就饱受了严重风湿病带来的痛苦和折磨。肾病是引起这个病的部分原因，她的肾病导致她浑身浮肿，医生诊断为肾炎。从健康的角度出发，她每年都要出门去佛罗里达、阿肯色等州旅行。其实她是有意无意地想多赚点钱。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She always spoke hopefully of the possibility of opening a boarding-house at some tropical winter resort, during the seasons there and in Altamont. In winter now, she rented Dixieland for a few months, sometimes for a year, although she really had no intention of allowing the place to slip through her fingers during the profitable summer season: usually, she let the place go, more or less deliberately, to some unscrupulous adventuress of lodging houses, good for a month's or two months' rent, but incapable of the sustained effort that would support it for a longer time. On her return from her journey, with rents in arrears, or with some other violation of the contract as an entering wedge, Eliza would surge triumphantly into battle, making a forced entrance with police, plain-clothes men, warrants, summonses, writs, injunctions, and all the other artillery of legal warfare, possessing herself forcibly, and with vindictive pleasure, of her property.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她经常满怀希望地说，如有可能会去南部能够避寒的热带地区开一所公寓。同时，阿尔特蒙的南都旅馆在夏季仍开门迎客。现在每年冬天她把南都旅馆租出去好几个月，有时甚至是一年，虽然她并不打算随随便便让有利可图的夏季生意从手里漏过去。通常情况下，她会多少有些故意地把房子租给那些不大靠得住的房客，这些人虽然能支付得起一两个月的房租，但是却没法长久住下去。这样，等到她旅行回来的时候，就能以拖欠房租为名，或者抓住他们其他违反租约的方面作为借口，气势汹汹地和他们争论。她的身边常带着警察、便衣、拘票、传票、书面文件等一些法律手段，不由分说、名正言顺地把自己的财产收回来，身心充满报复性的快感。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But she turned always into the South -- the North for her was a land which she threatened often to explore, but which secretly she held in suspicion: there was in her no deep animosity because of an old war, her feeling was rather one of fear, distrust, alienation -- the "Yankee" to whom she humorously referred was foreign and remote. So, she turned always into the South, the South that burned like Dark Helen in Eugene's blood, and she always took him with her. They still slept together.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她每次出门总是朝南方走——虽然她嘴上常说要去北方看一看，但是内心难免会有些疑虑。倒不是因为以前内战中南方吃了败仗而有什么旧恨，只是对北方佬有点恐惧、不信任，觉得他们既陌生又遥远。因此，她永远向着南方跑，每次都会把儿子尤金也带上。对尤金而言，南方就像“模糊的海伦”在他的血液里沸腾。直到现在，母子二人仍然同睡一张床。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His feeling for the South was not so much historic as it was of the core and desire of dark romanticism -- that unlimited and inexplicable drunkenness, the magnetism of some men's blood that takes them into the heart of the heat, and beyond that, into the polar and emerald cold of the South as swiftly as it took the heart of that incomparable romanticist who wrote The Rime of the Ancient Mariner, beyond which there is nothing. And this desire of his was unquestionably enhanced by all he had read and visioned, by the romantic halo that his school history cast over the section, by the whole fantastic distortion of that period where people were said to live in "mansions," and slavery was a benevolent institution, conducted to a constant banjo-strumming, the strewn largesses of the colonel and the shuffle-dance of his happy dependents, where all women were pure, gentle, and beautiful, all men chivalrous and brave, and the Rebel horde a company of swagger, death-mocking cavaliers. Years later, when he could no longer think of the barren spiritual wilderness, the hostile and murderous intrenchment against all new life -- when their cheap mythology, their legend of the charm of their manner, the aristocratic culture of their lives, the quaint sweetness of their drawl, made him writhe -- when he could think of no return to their life and its swarming superstition without weariness and horror, so great was his fear of the legend, his fear of their antagonism, that he still pretended the most fanatic devotion to them, excusing his Northern residence on grounds of necessity rather than desire.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他对南方的情感，与其说是历史性的倒不如说是出于内心深藏的一种浪漫欲望——一种永无休止、一种无法理解的沉醉感，就像某些人血液的磁力，吸引着他们投身于火热的中心，投身于南极冰冷、碧绿的水泽之中，就如同那位写就“古舟子咏”战无不胜的浪漫主义者，义无反顾地交出心来，走到无法再走的地方为止。毫无疑问，他的这个欲望在他读过的诸多书籍和读书之后产生的想象中更为加强。其他因素还包括：他接受教育的历史为这一部分投射的浪漫光环，当时传说人们都住在深宅大院这种荒诞的歪曲，奴隶制是最为仁慈的制度形式，在这种制度下号称“上校”的贵族们宽宏大度；天真烂漫的黑奴们快乐地弹奏着班卓琴，拖着步子跳舞；所有的女士们都纯洁、温柔、美丽，所有的男士都富有骑士风度、英勇善战，所有的叛军都是狂妄自大、视死如归的武士。许多年以后，尤金不愿意再提起那片荒芜的精神原野，也不能再想象这片精神原野的荒芜，那种根深蒂固仇视一切新生的态度，那些庸俗廉价的神话和自鸣得意的斯文传统，他们的所谓贵族文化，那些人说话时那种怪声怪气又软又甜的口音，简直让他无地自容——如果没有疲倦和恐惧，他就难以想象还会重返那种虚伪迷信的生活。他多么惧怕那些神奇传说，惧怕他们的敌视，所以他依然假装对一切都充满了热忱的态度，并为自己并非出于自愿而住在北方寻找借口。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She took him to Florida in the late winter following Gant's return from Augusta: they went to Tampa first, and, a few days later, to Saint Petersburg. He plowed through the loose deep sand of the streets, fished interminably with jolly old men at the end of the long pier, devoured a chest full of dime novels that he found in the rooms she had rented in a private house. They left abruptly, after a terrific quarrel with the old Cracker who ran the place, who thought himself tricked out of the best part of a season's rent, and hurried off to South Carolina on receipt of a hysterical message from Daisy which bade her mother to "come at once." They arrived in the dingy little town, which was sticky with wet clay, and clammy with rain, in late March: Daisy's first child, a boy, had been born the day before. Eliza, annoyed at what she considered the useless disruption of her holiday, quarrelled bitterly with her daughter a day or two after her arrival, and departed for Altamont with the declaration, which Daisy ironically applauded, that she would never return again. But she did.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在甘特从奥古斯塔返回的那个冬天，伊丽莎带着他去了佛罗里达。他们首先抵达坦帕，几天后又来到圣彼得斯堡。他在那些铺了细沙的街头走了很多路，偶尔也会坐在长长的桥头，和几个乐悠悠的老头一起钓鱼，饱览出租屋里一整柜情节动人但文学价值不高的文学作品。后来不知什么原因，房东说租金太便宜，认为他在这个季节里蒙受了巨大的损失，吃了亏，因此双方大吵了一通。恰巧在这个时候，他们接到了黛西发来的一封急电，要求母亲“速来”。于是他们母子二人便匆匆赶往南卡罗来纳州。在3月下旬的一天，他们赶到了黛西所在的那个阴雨泥泞的邋遢小城，发现黛西在头一天刚刚生下她的第一个孩子，她生了个男孩。伊丽莎觉得这样一件无关紧要的事打断了她的旅行，一脸的不高兴，刚到没几天就跟女儿激烈地吵起架来，说要马上返回阿尔特蒙，并声称以后再也不来了，而黛西也毫不示弱，她干脆不无讽刺地说不来也罢，正中下怀。但事后伊丽莎还是会去女儿那儿的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So did his boundaries stretch into enchantment -- into fabulous and solitary wonder broken only by Eliza's stingy practicality, by her lack of magnificence in a magnificent world, by the meals of sweet rolls and milk and butter in an untidy room, by the shoe boxes of luncheon carried on the trains and opened in the diner, after a lengthy inspection of the menu had led to the ordering of coffee, by the interminable quarrels over price and charges in almost every place they went, by her commands to him to "scrooch up" when the conductor came through for the tickets, for he was a tall lank boy, and his half-fare age might be called to question.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的视野的确延伸到迷人的仙境中去了——延伸到神奇、孤独的惊讶中去了，只不过这一切常被伊丽莎的抠门和算计破坏了，被这样一个壮美世界中的小气母亲破坏掉了。还有许许多多的因素：住在破破烂烂的屋子里，在零乱屋子里总是以牛奶、甜面包和黄油为伙食，乘坐火车的时候总用鞋盒子自备午餐，在餐车里坐下后还要认真地观察、研究菜单，最后只点来一杯咖啡，走到任何地方都没完没了地跟别人讨价还价，每次查票员过来时都要慌忙叫他“蹲下去”，因为他长得人高马大，买的半价票可能会引起对方的怀疑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Finally, it occurred to him that these people had given him nothing, that neither their love not their hatred could injure him, that he owed them nothing, and he determined that he would say so, and repay their insolence with a curse. And he did.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一直到最后他才想起，这些人并没有带给他任何好处。他们对他深爱也好，仇恨也罢，都无关痛痒，他并不欠他们任何东西。他下定决心要把这些话告诉他们，来个以怨报怨。他的确这么做了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The following winter she went to New Orleans at the season of the Mardi Gras, taking her youngest with her. Eugene remembered the huge cisterns for rain-water, in the back yard of Aunt Mary's house, the heavy window-rattling thunder of Mary's snores at night, and the vast pageantry of carnival on Canal Street: the storied floats, the smiling beauties, the marching troops, the masks grotesque and fantastical. And once more he saw ships at anchor at the foot of Canal Street; and their tall keels looked over on the street behind the sea walls; and in the cemeteries all the graves were raised above the ground "because," said Oll, Gant's nephew, "the water rots 'em."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二年冬天，她在狂欢节期间到新奥尔良去，也带了小儿子同去。尤金还记得玛丽姑妈家后院里有一口蓄积雨水的巨型水缸；还记得晚上睡觉时姑妈雷鸣般的呼噜声震得窗户哗啦啦直响；还有在运河街张灯结彩、盛大的狂欢盛会：多层的彩车、微笑的美女、整齐行进的方阵，各种各样古怪、荒诞的面具。在那个地方，他再次看到了许多停泊在运河街尽头的船只，那些船身高大的龙骨巍巍地俯视着堤岸这边的大街；他在小镇的墓地里看见所有的坟墓都高出了地面，有些迷惑不解，而甘特的侄儿奥尔解释说，“如果不高出地面就会被水淹掉了”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And he remembered the smells of the French market, the heavy fragrance of the coffee he drank there, and the foreign Sunday gaiety of the city's life -- the theatres open, the sound of hammer and saw, the gay festivity of crowds. He visited the Boyles, old guests at Dixieland, who lived in the old French quarter, sleeping at night with Frank Boyle in a vast dark room lighted dimly with tapers: they had as cook an ancient negress who spoke only French, and who returned from the Market early in the morning bearing a huge basket loaded with vegetables, tropical fruits, fowls, meats. She cooked strange delicious food that he had never tasted before -- heavy gumbo, garnished steaks, sauced fowls.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他还能回忆起法兰西市场上的各种味道，还有曾在那里喝过的浓咖啡的香味，以及那儿的星期天里充满欢娱的都市生活——剧院开放、木工工具杂乱的声音、沉浸在节日喜庆中的人群。他也到波尔家做过客，他是南都旅馆的老主顾了，家就在城中古老的法国区。当时尤金和他家的小孩弗兰克·波尔同睡在一间大而黑暗的屋子里，室内点着昏暗的蜡烛。他们家的厨师是个黑人老太婆，她只会讲法语。她每天一大早就会从菜场返回，带着一大篮蔬菜、热带水果、鸡鸭鱼肉。她做的饭菜具有一股奇特的香味，他一辈子也没有吃过那么好吃的饭菜——浓重的大烩汤、精制牛排、卤鸡卤鸭。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They had but shortly returned from Mardi Gras when, one howling night in winter, as he lay asleep at Gant's, the house was wakened by his father's terrible cries. Gant had been drinking heavily, day after fearful day. Eugene had been sent in the afternoons to his shop to fetch him home, and at sundown, with Jannadeau's aid, had brought him, behind the negro's spavined horse, roaring drunk to his house. There followed the usual routine of soup-feeding, undressing, and holding him in check until Doctor McGuire arrived, thrust his needle deeply into Gant's stringy arm, left sleeping-powders, and departed. The girl was exhausted: Gant himself had ravaged his strength, and had been brought down by two or three painful attacks of rheumatism.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们从新奥尔良的狂欢节返回没多久，在一个寒风怒吼的冬夜里，尤金睡在他父亲甘特那里，全家人都忽然被甘特的大声喊叫声吵醒了。甘特近来酒喝得特别多，一天比一天醉得厉害。每天下午尤金都被派去从甘特的店里把他接回家，总要弄到太阳落山的时候，才会在简那度的帮助下，用黑人那辆跛脚马车把他载回来。到家的时候早已酩酊大醉了。接下来他经常做的事情就是给父亲喂汤、脱衣，然后牢牢地控制住他，等待麦奎尔医生尽快赶来，在他精瘦的胳臂上打一针，留下安眠药粉才会离去。此刻，女儿已经精疲力竭了，而甘特自己早先闹过两三次风湿病，饱受了折磨，所以他的体力也已经消耗得差不多了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And he looked upon the huge yellow snake of the river, dreaming of its distant shores, the myriad estuaries lush with tropical growth that fed it, all the romantic life of plantation and canefields that fringed it, of moonlight, of dancing darkies on the levee, of slow lights on the gilded river boat, and the perfumed flesh of black-haired women, musical wraiths below the phantom drooping trees.</div>

<div class="line_en">Now, he awoke in the dark, possessed by his terror and agony, for the whole right side of his body was paralyzed by such pain as he did not know existed. He cursed and supplicated God alternately in his pain and terror. For days doctor and nurse strove with him, hoping that the leaping inflammation would not strike at his heart. He was gnarled, twisted, and bent with a savage attack of inflammatory rheumatism. As soon as he had recovered sufficiently to travel, he departed, under Helen's care, for Hot Springs. Almost savagely, she drove all other assistance from him, devoting every minute of the day to his care: they were gone six weeks -- occasionally post-cards and letters describing a life of hotels, mineral baths, sickness and lameness, and the sport of the blooded rich, came to add new colors to Eugene's horizon: when they returned Gant was able again to walk, the rheumatism had been boiled from his limbs, but his right hand, gnarled and stiff, was permanently crippled. He was never again able to close it, and there was something strangely chastened in his manner, a gleam of awe and terror in his eyes.</div>

<div class="line_en">Eliza boiled herself out at the baths daily; sometimes, he went along with her, leaving her with a sensation of drunken independence, while he went into the men's quarters, stripping himself in a cool room, entering thence a hot one lined with couches, shutting himself in a steam-closet where he felt himself momentarily dwindling into the raining puddle of sweat at his feet, to emerge presently on trembling legs and to be rolled and kneaded about magnificently in a huge tub by a powerful grinning negro. Later, languorous, but with a feeling of deep purification, he lay out on one of the couches, victoriously his own man in a man's world. They talked from couch to couch, or walked pot-belliedly about, sashed coyly with bath towels -- malarial Southerners with malarial drawls, paunch-eyed alcoholics, purple-skinned gamblers, and broken down prize-fighters.

<div class="line_en">"You've got to help me drum up some trade, if we're to live, boy," she said again, with the lip-pursing, mouth-tremulous jocularity that was coming to wound him so deeply, because he felt it was only an obvious mask for a more obvious insincerity.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“孩子，要想过好日子，你就得帮我多拉些生意来。”她老是这句话，说话的时候噘着嘴，双唇微微地颤动着，想强挤出点笑容来。这使他非常难受，因为他明知母亲假意这样说，还想做虚伪的掩饰。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He writhed as he saw himself finally a toughened pachyderm in Eliza's world -- sprucing up confidently, throwing his shoulders back proudly, making people "think he was somebody" as he cordially acknowledged an introduction by producing a card setting forth the joys of life in Altamont and at Dixieland, and seized every opening in social relations for the purpose of "drumming up trade." He hated the jargon of the profession, which she had picked up somewhere long before, and which she used constantly with such satisfaction -- smacking her lips as she spoke of "transients," or of "drumming up trade." In him, as in Gant, there was a silent horror of selling for money the bread of one's table, the shelter of one's walls, to the guest, the stranger, the unknown friend from out the world; to the sick, the weary, the lonely, the broken, the knave, the harlot, and the fool.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后来他终于明白自己在伊丽莎的世界里扮演的是怎样一个厚脸皮的角色——打起精神、腰身笔直、挺起胸脯，让别人一看就知道“他是个有能耐的人”，一面逢人就自我介绍，掏出一张卡片来宣传阿尔特蒙和南都旅馆的美好之处，为了“多拉点生意”，他绝不放过每一个与人打交道的场合。他母亲早就学会了一套行业术语，同时还得意地把这些术语挂在嘴边——什么“短期客”啦、“揽客”啦，而他最不喜欢这些行话。他和甘特一样，非常不喜欢把家里桌上的面包拿去赚钱，也不喜欢把自家的房间租给那些房客、陌生人、来自世界各地的朋友，或者病人、疲惫不堪者、孤独者、潦倒者、流氓、妓女和笨蛋。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And he gazed for hours into the entrances of the fashionable hotels, staring at the ladies' legs upon the verandas, watching the great ones of the land at their recreations, thinking, with a pang of wonder, that here were the people of Chambers, of Phillips, of all the society novelists, leading their godlike lives in flesh, recording their fiction. He was deeply reverential before the grand manner of these books, particularly before the grand manner of the English books: there people loved, but not as other people, elegantly; their speech was subtle, delicate, exquisite; even in their passions there was no gross lust or strong appetite -- they were incapable of the vile thoughts or the meaty desire of common people. As he looked at the comely thighs of the young women on horses, fascinated to see their shapely legs split over the strong good smell of a horse, he wondered if the warm sinuous vibration of the great horse-back excited them, and what their love was like. The preposterous elegance of their manner in the books awed him: he saw seduction consummated in kid gloves, to the accompaniment of subtle repartee. Such thoughts, when he had them, filled him with shame at his own baseness -- he imagined for these people a love conducted beyond all the laws of nature, achieving the delight of animals or of common men by the electrical touch of a finger, the flicker of an eye, the intonation of a phrase -- exquisitely and incorruptibly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他会一连好几个钟头盯着豪华旅馆的入口，瞪目凝视着阳台上女客们的大腿，观察那些休闲的大人物，他又惊又痛，觉得他们就是各类小说中钱伯斯和菲利普式的人物，他们过着神仙般的生活，编织着自己的故事。他深深地折服于这些小说了不起的气魄，尤其是那些英国出版的书籍。这些书中的人物也谈情说爱，但和一般人并不同，他们的举止高雅，他们说出的话含蓄而微妙；甚至在他们激情迸发的时候也没有半点的粗俗或者贪欲——他们不具备凡夫俗子的龌龊思想和肉欲邪念。他的眼睛紧紧地盯着骑马女士秀美的大腿，看着她们优美的大腿夹住坐骑，直看得他神魂颠倒，心里很想知道那雄伟的马背温暖起伏的颤动会不会使她们兴奋起来，也想知道她们爱起来的滋味如何。那些书里所形容的这些高贵、典雅的言谈举止差点儿把他唬住了：他所见的男女人物连偷情都会戴着手套、温文尔雅地进行。一想到这些，他不禁自惭形秽，觉得自己竟如此下流——在他的想象中，书中人物的谈情说爱全都超越了一切自然法则，只要轻轻一碰、眨一下眼、声音的语调一变就能达到动物或者普通人所追求的快乐。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Thus, lost in the remote Ozarks, he wandered up Central Avenue, fringed on both sides by the swift-sloping hills, for him, by the borders of enchantment, the immediate portals of a land of timeless and never-ending faery. He drank endlessly the water that came smoking from the earth, hoping somehow to wash himself clean from all pollution, beginning his everlasting fantasy of the miraculous spring, or the bath, neck-high, of curative mud, which would draw out of a man's veins each drop of corrupted blood, dry up in him a cancerous growth, dwindle and absorb a cyst, remove all scorbutic blemishes, scoop and suck and thread away the fibrous slime of all disease, leaving him again with the perfect flesh of an animal.</div>

<div class="line_en">And later, again, along the sandy coast of Florida, with Eliza, he wandered down the narrow lanes of Saint Augustine, raced along the hard packed beach of Daytona, scoured the green lawns of Palm Beach, before the hotels, for cocoanuts, which Eliza desired as souvenirs, filling a brown tow sack with them and walking, with the bag hung from his shoulders, down the interminable aisles of the Royal Poinciana or the Breakers, target of scorn, and scandal, and amusement from slave and prince; or traversed the spacious palm-cool walks that cut the peninsula, to see, sprawled in the sensual loose sand the ladies' silken legs, the brown lean bodies of the men, the long seaplunges in the unending scroll-work of the emerald and infinite sea, which had beat in his brain from his father's shells, which had played at his mountain heart, but which never, until now, had he seen. Through the spattered sunlight of the palms, in the smooth walks, princess and lord were wheeled: in latticed bar-rooms, droning with the buzzing fans, men drank from glacéd tall glasses.</div>

<div class="line_en">Thus did he see first, he the hill-bound, the sky-girt, of whom the mountains were his masters, the fabulous South. The picture of flashing field, of wood, and hill, stayed in his heart forever: lost in the dark land, he lay the night-long through within his berth, watching the shadowy and phantom South flash by, sleeping at length, and waking suddenly, to see cool lakes in Florida at dawn, standing quietly as if they had waited from eternity for this meeting; or hearing, as the train in the dark hours of morning slid into Savannah, the strange quiet voices of the men upon the platform, the boding faint echoes of the station, or seeing, in pale dawn, the phantom woods, a rutted lane, a cow, a boy, a drab, dull-eyed against a cottage door, glimpsed, at this moment of rushing time, for which all life had been aplot, to flash upon the window and be gone.</div>
