<div class="line_en">But Park hadn't done anything. Not since the eyeliner -- which he knew wasn't dead, but it seemed in remission. Maybe his parents knew somehow about yesterday…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="帕克没做什么啊。眼线风波虽然没有完全过去，至少是暂时赦免了。那之后他没干过什么啊，除非他们不知怎么地知道了昨天的事…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Even if they did, Park hadn't done anything with Eleanor that he'd ever been explicitly told not to do. His mom never talked to him about that kind of thing. And his dad hadn't said anything more than "Don't get anybody pregnant" since he told Park about sex in the fifth grade. (He'd told Josh at the same time, which was insulting.)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就算他们知道了，他和埃莉诺也没做他们明确告诫不可以做的事。妈妈从来不讲那方面的事；爸爸在帕克五年级（乔许也在场，那简直是侮辱）时告诉他那码子事，后来就只说过“别搞大人家肚子”这类话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="埃莉诺心想：哪有什么底，就是提娜。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tina had watched Eleanor get on the bus that morning with her tongue on her top lip, like she was waiting for Eleanor to spaz out -- or like she was trying to see whether Eleanor was wearing any toilet clothes. But Park was right there, practically pulling Eleanor into his lap -- so it was easy to ignore Tina and everybody else. He looked so cute this morning. Instead of his usual scary black band T-shirt, he was wearing a green shirt that said "Kiss Me, I'm Irish."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天上午埃莉诺一上校车，就看到提娜用舌头舔着上唇，好像在等着看埃莉诺失控，或者想知道埃莉诺是不是穿了马桶里的衣服。但是帕克就在车上，几乎是一把把埃莉诺拉到大腿上，很容易就让她忽略提娜与其他人。帕克看起来很可爱，一反平日恐怖的黑色乐队T恤，今天他穿了一件绿T恤，上面写“吻我，我是爱尔兰人”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They hung out in his bedroom after dinner (Tater Tot casserole) and managed to sneak kisses while they looked through all of Park's old school pictures.
