<div class="line_en">When I next returned to Buck's Peak, it was autumn and Grandma-down-the-hill was dying. For nine years she had battled the cancer in her bone marrow; now the contest was ending. I had just learned that I'd won a place at Cambridge to study for a PhD when Mother wrote to me. "Grandma is in the hospital again," she said. "Come quick. I think this will be the last time."</div>

<div class="line_en">When I landed in Salt Lake, Grandma was drifting in and out of consciousness. Drew met me at the airport. We were more than friends by then, and Drew said he would drive me to Idaho, to the hospital in town.</div>

<div class="line_en">I hadn't been back there since I'd taken Shawn years before, and as I walked down its white, antiseptic hallway, it was difficult not to think of him. We found Grandma's room. Grandpa was seated at her bedside, holding her speckled hand. Her eyes were open and she looked at me. "It's my little Tara, come all the way from England," she said, then her eyes closed. Grandpa squeezed her hand but she was asleep. A nurse told us she would likely sleep for hours.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="自从几年前送肖恩来医院那次，我就再也没来过这里。穿过弥漫着消毒水味的白色走廊时，我很难不想起他。我们找到奶奶的病房。爷爷正坐在她的床边，握着她长满老年斑的手。她睁开眼睛看着我。“是我的小塔拉，大老远从英国回来啦。”说完，她闭上了眼睛。爷爷捏了捏她的手，但她睡着了。一位护士告诉我们，她可能会睡上几小时。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Drew said he would drive me to Buck's Peak. I agreed, and it wasn't until the mountain came into view that I wondered whether I'd made a mistake. Drew had heard my stories, but still there was a risk in bringing him here: this was not a story, and I doubted whether anyone would play the part I had written for them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="德鲁说他会开车送我到巴克峰，我同意了。直到那座山映入眼帘时，我才怀疑这是否是个错误的决定。德鲁听过我的故事，但将他带到这里来还是颇有风险：毕竟这不是一个故事，我不确定是否有人会按照我为他们写就的剧本扮演角色。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The house was in chaos. There were women everywhere, some taking orders over the phone, others mixing oils or straining tinctures. There was a new annex on the south side of the house, where younger women were filling bottles and packaging orders for shipment. I left Drew in the living room and went to the bathroom, which was the only room in the house that still looked the way I remembered it. When I came out I walked straight into a thin old woman with wiry hair and large, square glasses.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="房子里一片混乱。到处都是女人，有的在打电话接订单，有的在调制精油，有的在过滤酊剂。房子南面又扩建了一个新房间，更年轻点儿的女人在那里装瓶、打包订单、等待发货。我让德鲁待在起居室，去了卫生间，那是家中唯一看起来与我的记忆保持一致的房间。当我从里面出来时，一头撞在一个瘦瘦的老妇人身上。她头发硬直，戴一副大方框眼镜。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I still hadn't seen either of my parents. I weaved my way back through the house and found Drew on the sofa, listening to a woman explain that aspirin can cause infertility. I grasped his hand and pulled him behind me, cutting a path through the strangers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我仍然没见到父母的身影。我穿过屋子走回去，发现德鲁坐在沙发上，正在听一个女人向他解释阿司匹林会导致不孕不育。我一把抓起他的手，拉着他越过陌生人往前走。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I found Mother in a windowless room in the basement. I had the impression that she was hiding there. I introduced her to Drew and she smiled warmly. "Where's Dad?" I said.

<div class="line_cn" title="我在地下室一间没有窗户的房间里找到了母亲。我已感觉到她是故意躲在那里的。我向她介绍了德鲁，她热情地微笑。“爸爸呢？”我问。我怀疑他卧病在床，自从爆炸烧焦了他的肺，他经常患肺病。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mother came with us upstairs. The moment she appeared on the landing, she was hailed by several of her employees with questions from clients. Everyone seemed to want her opinion -- about their burns, their heart tremors, their underweight infants. She waved them off and pressed forward. The impression she gave as she moved through her own house was of a celebrity in a crowded restaurant, trying not to be recognized.</div>

<div class="line_en">My father's desk was the size of a car. It was parked in the center of the chaos. He was on the phone, which he'd wedged between his cheek and shoulder so it wouldn't slip through his waxy hands. "Doctors can't help with them diabetes," he said, much too loudly. "But the Lord can!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="父亲的书桌和一辆汽车一样大，处于一片混乱的正中央。他正在接电话。他把电话夹在脸颊和肩膀之间，这样它就不会从他蜡状的手中滑落。“医生治不好糖尿病，”他用大嗓门说，“但上帝能！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I looked sideways at Drew, who was smiling. Dad hung up and turned toward us. He greeted Drew with a large grin. He radiated energy, feeding off the general bedlam of the house. Drew said he was impressed with the business, and Dad seemed to grow six inches. "We've been blessed for doing the Lord's work," he said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我斜眼看看德鲁，他在微笑。爸爸挂断电话，转向我们，咧嘴一笑，跟德鲁打了招呼。他活力四射，从一屋子的混乱中汲取能量。德鲁说这门生意令他印象深刻，爸爸听了似乎一下子长高了六英寸。“我们因行上帝的工作而受到祝福。”他说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The phone rang again. There were at least three employees tasked with answering it, but Dad leapt for the receiver as if he'd been waiting for an important call. I'd never seen him so full of life.</div>

<div class="line_en">The noise in the house was disorienting, so I took Drew up the mountain. We strolled through fields of wild wheat and from there into the skirt of pines at the mountain base. The fall colors were soothing and we stayed for hours, gazing down at the quiet valley. It was late afternoon when we finally made our way back to the house and Drew left for Salt Lake City.</div>

<div class="line_en">My father lost his appetite for the business. He started getting out of bed later and later, and when he did, it seemed it was only to insult or accuse. He shouted at Shawn about the junkyard and lectured Mother about her management of the employees. He snapped at Audrey when she tried to make him lunch, and barked at me for typing too loudly. It was as if he wanted to fight, to punish himself for the old woman's death. Or perhaps the punishment was for her life, for the conflict that had been between them, which had only ended now she was dead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="父亲对生意失去了兴致。他起床越来越晚，当他起来，似乎也只是为了辱骂或指责别人。因为废料场的事他对肖恩大嚷，因为员工管理问题他教训母亲，奥黛丽想给他做午饭被他厉声呵斥，嫌我打字声音太吵朝我咆哮。他似乎想要打架，因为老人的死而惩罚自己。或者这种惩罚是因为她的一生中他们之间从未停歇的冲突。现在她死了，冲突才结束。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The house slowly filled again. The phones were reconnected, and women materialized to answer them. Dad's desk remained empty. He spent his days in bed, gazing up at the stucco ceiling. I brought him supper, as I had as a child, and wondered now, as I'd wondered then, whether he knew I was there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="房子里慢慢地又填满了人。电话重新接通了，又有女人接起了电话。爸爸的桌前仍然是空的。他整天躺在床上，凝视着灰泥天花板。我像小时候那样给他送晚饭，现在也和过去一样，我甚至在想，他是否知道我在那里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mother moved about the house with the vitality of ten people, mixing tinctures and essential oils, directing her employees between making funeral arrangements and cooking for every cousin and aunt who dropped in unannounced to reminisce about Grandma. As often as not I'd find her in an apron, hovering over a roast with a phone in each hand, one a client, the other an uncle or friend calling to offer condolences. Through all this my father remained in bed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="母亲带着十个人的活力在房子里走动，在安排葬礼与为每一位不请自来悼念奶奶的表亲和姑妈做饭的间隙，混合酊剂和精油、指导手下的员工。我常常发现她系着围裙，在烤肉架前转来转去，两手各持一部电话，一头是客户，另一头是某个表示哀悼的叔叔或朋友。在此期间父亲一直躺在床上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dad spoke at the funeral. His speech was a twenty-minute sermon on God's promises to Abraham. He mentioned my grandmother twice. To strangers it must have seemed he was hardly affected by the loss of his mother, but we knew better, we who could see the devastation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爸爸在葬礼上发言，念了二十分钟上帝对亚伯拉罕的应许的布道词。他只提到奶奶两次。在外人看来，似乎丧母并未影响到他，但我们深知此事对他的毁灭性打击。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When we arrived home from the service, Dad was incensed that lunch wasn't ready. Mother scrambled to serve the stew she'd left to slow-cook, but after the meal Dad seemed equally frustrated by the dishes, which Mother hurriedly cleaned, and then by his grandchildren, who played noisily while Mother dashed about trying to hush them.</div>

<div class="line_en">He had said the exact wrong thing. For ten years, Mother had been the primary breadwinner, while continuing to cook meals, clean the house, do the laundry, and I had never once heard her express anything like resentment. Until now.</div>

<div class="line_en">Soon they were both shouting. Dad tried to corral her, to subdue her with a show of anger, the way he always had, but this only made her more stubborn. Eventually she tossed the cards on the table and said, "Fill them out or don't. But if you don't, no one will." Then she marched downstairs. Dad followed, and for an hour their shouts rose up through the floor. I'd never heard my parents shout like that -- at least, not my mother. I'd never seen her refuse to give way.</div>

<div class="line_en">The next morning I found Dad in the kitchen, dumping flour into a glue-like substance I assumed was supposed to be pancake batter. When he saw me, he dropped the flour and sat at the table. "You're a woman, ain'tcha?" he said. "Well, this here's a kitchen." We stared at each other and I contemplated the distance that had sprung up between us -- how natural those words sounded to his ears, how grating to mine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天早上我发现爸爸在厨房里，将面粉倒进像胶水一样的东西里，我猜那应该是煎薄饼用的面糊。他一看见我，便放下面粉，坐在桌旁。“你是女人，对吧？”他说，“喏，厨房是你的了。”我们盯着彼此，我思索着我们之间已然出现的距离——这些话在他听来是如此自然，于我是何等刺耳。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It wasn't like Mother to leave Dad to make his own breakfast. I thought she might be ill and went downstairs to check on her. I'd barely made it to the landing when I heard it: deep sobs coming from the bathroom, muffled by the steady drone of a blow-dryer. I stood outside the door and listened for more than a minute, paralyzed. Would she want me to leave, to pretend I hadn't heard? I waited for her to catch her breath, but her sobs only grew more desperate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="让爸爸自己做早餐，这可不像母亲的做法。我以为她病了，于是下楼去看她。我刚下楼梯就听到了声音：卫生间里隐约传来深沉的呜咽，被吹风机持续的嗡鸣声所掩盖。我站在门外，呆呆地听了逾一分钟。她会不会想让我走开，让我假装什么都没听见？我等着她停下来歇口气，但她的啜泣声越来越绝望。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I knocked. "It's me," I said.</div>

<div class="line_en">The door opened, a sliver at first, then wider, and there was my mother, her skin glistening from the shower, wrapped in a towel that was too small to cover her. I had never seen my mother this way, and instinctively I closed my eyes. The world went black. I heard a thud, the cracking of plastic, and opened my eyes. Mother had dropped the blow-dryer and it had struck the floor, its roar now doubled as it rebounded off the exposed concrete. I looked at her, and as I did she pulled me to her and held me. The wet from her body seeped into my clothes, and I felt droplets slide from her hair and onto my shoulder.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="门开了，一开始只是一条缝，接着又宽了一些。是我的母亲，她刚洗完澡，皮肤闪闪发光。她裹着一块毛巾，但毛巾太小，没有将她全部包裹住。我从没见过母亲这样，本能地闭上眼睛。世界一片黑暗。我听见砰的一声，是塑料破碎的声音，于是我睁开眼。吹风机从母亲的手里掉落在地上，在裸露的水泥地板上弹了一下，嗡鸣声大了一倍。我看着她，就在我这么做的时候，她将我拉到身边，抱住了我。她身上的湿气渗进我的衣服，我感觉到水珠从她的头发上滴落至我的肩膀。">查看中文翻译</div>
