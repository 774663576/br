<div class="line_en">Kitty turned round and saw a face which at the first moment she did not recognize. Then her heart gave a sudden quick beat and she flushed. It was Dorothy Townsend. Kitty so little expected to see her that she knew neither what to do nor what to say. But Mrs. Townsend came into the cabin and with an impulsive gesture took Kitty in her arms…</div>

<div class="line_en">When the boat docked at Hong Kong, Kitty, who had been standing on deck to look at the coloured, gay and vivacious traffic of the river, went into her cabin to see that the amah had left nothing behind. She gave herself a look in the glass. She wore black, the nuns had dyed a dress for her, but not mourning; and the thought crossed her mind that the first thing she must do was to see to this. The habiliments of woe could not but serve as an effective disguise to her unexpected feelings. There was a knock on her cabin door. The amah opened it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汽船在香港的码头靠了岸，凯蒂一直站在甲板上，观望着河面上熙来攘往的船只。这时她跑回自己的客舱，女佣已经把行李都打点完毕了。她照了照镜子，此时她正穿着一身黑色的衣服，是嬷嬷们此前给她染过的，权当作丧服穿。她脑子里想到的第一件事就是衣服，居丧的装束可以很好地遮掩住她现在如流泄堤的情绪。有人敲了敲客舱的门，女佣过去将门打开。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“到甲板上去吧。让佣人来拿你的东西，我把童仆带来了。”她拉起了凯蒂的手，凯蒂便由她前面引路。她发现这个女人晒黑了的、和善的脸上，的确是有一种关切的神情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Kitty turned away. She had a lump in her throat. It was funny that a little unexpected kindness should so affect her. She did not want to cry; she wished Dorothy Townsend would go away. But Dorothy took the hand that was hanging by Kitty's side and pressed it. It embarrassed Kitty that this shy woman should be so demonstrative.</div>

<div class="line_en">"But you must. You can't go and live all by yourself in your own house. It would be dreadful for you. I've prepared everything. You shall have your own sitting-room. You can have your meals there if you don't care to have them with us. We both want you to come."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可是你必须来。你不能单独一个人住在自己家里，那对你来说太可怕了。我已经都打理妥当了，你会有自己的起居室。如果你不介意的话，可以和我们共进晚餐。我们两个都盼着你来。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I don't know why you should be so kind to me." Kitty was getting a little short of excuses; she could not bring herself to utter a blunt and definite no. "I'm afraid I'm not very good company among strangers just now."</div>

<div class="line_en">"But need we be strangers to you? Oh, I do so want not to be, I so want you to allow me to be your friend." Dorothy clasped her hands and her voice, her cool, deliberate and distinguished voice, was tremulous with tears. "I so awfully want you to come. You see, I want to make amends to you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“难道我们和你不熟吗？呃，我绝不希望是这样，我希望你能允许我做你的朋友。”多萝西两手相握于胸前，那平稳、沉着、高贵的声调颤抖了，眼泪也流了下来。“我热烈期盼着你能来。你知道，我要弥补我对你犯下的过错。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"And when I heard that you'd gone with your husband into the jaws of death, without a moment's hesitation, I felt such a frightful cad. I felt so humiliated. You've been so wonderful, you've been so brave, you make all the rest of us look so dreadfully cheap and second-rate." Now the tears were pouring down her kind, homely face. "I can't tell you how much I admire you and what a respect I have for you. I know I can do nothing to make up for your terrible loss, but I want you to know how deeply, how sincerely I feel for you. And if you'll only allow me to do a little something for you it will be a privilege. Don't bear me a grudge because I misjudged you. You're heroic and I'm just a silly fool of a woman."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当我听说你毫不犹豫地和你丈夫去了那个危险的地方，我简直觉得自己就是一个下流胚。我羞愧极了。你是如此地伟大，如此地勇敢，你使我们所有人都成了小人、胆小鬼。”现在她那张亲切、端庄的脸上已经是泪如泉涌了。“我说不出来我有多么地钦佩你，多么地尊敬你。我知道，对于你痛失亲人我无能为力，但是我希望你能明白，我对你是真心诚意的。如果你能允许我为你做哪怕一点点小事，那就是赦免了我的罪过。不要因为我曾经错看了你就怨恨我，你是一个杰出的女人，而我是那么地愚蠢。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Kitty gave her a passing glance. What she meant was that at first she had thought Kitty vulgar. Though Kitty allowed no shadow of it to show on her face in her heart she laughed. Much she cared for what any one thought ofher now!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯蒂飞快地看了她一眼。多萝西起初认为她粗鄙而缺乏教养，那是什么意思？但是很快，虽然凯蒂的脸上没有什么变化，却在心里笑了起来：她现在还会在乎谁对她怎么想吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
