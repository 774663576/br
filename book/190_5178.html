<div class="line_en">Seated by the window was Nancy, repairing Sikes' old jacket. She, too, was thin and pale. At Sikes' voice she raised her head from her work. "Not long past seven," she said. "How do you feel now, Bill?"</div>

<div class="line_en">The room he was lying in was very small and dirty. It was a different room from the one he had occupied before the Chertsey expedition, but it was in the same poor part of London. there were so few possessions or comforts in the room that it was clear Mr Sikes had met hard times. He himself was thin and pale from illness, and was lying on the bed, wrapped in an old coat. The white dog lay on the floor next to him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他躺在一间脏乱狭小的屋子里。这已不是他去切特赛远征之前住的那间房子了，但仍旧是在伦敦原先的那个贫民区。屋里没有什么家什和用具，很明显，赛克斯先生遇上艰难的日子了。由于得了一场病，他非常瘦弱、苍白，身上裹着一件破旧的大衣，缩在床上。那条白色的狗趴在旁边的地上。">查看中文翻译</div>

When They saw Nancy, They hurried to help her. Charley rubbed her hand s and the Dodger gave her a drink from the bottle he carried. Gradually, Nancy recovered her senses.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这里究竟出了什么事？”从门外传来了一个人的声音，原来是费金走了进来，后面跟着插翅神偷和查理·贝茨。他们看到南希，连忙过去帮助她。查理不停地搓着她的两只手，神偷拿出自己带在身上的一瓶酒给她灌了一口。慢慢地，南希恢复了知觉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="到了家里，费金对那姑娘说：“亲爱的，我上楼去给比尔找点现钱。这行当没多少油水，南希，钱又少，又不落好——可我就是喜欢看着年轻人在我身边。”突然，前门外传来了一个男人的声音，南希一听见这声音，立刻在椅子上挺直了身子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As soon as They had left the room, Nancy took off her shoes and crept silently up the stairs to listen in the passage -- as she had done once before. She was gone for a quarter of an hour, then, like a ghost, she reappeared in the downstairs room and sat down. Immediately afterwards, the two men descended the stairs.</div>

<div class="line_en">At first when she returned, Sikes noticed nothing unusual about her. Fagin, with his sharp, suspicious eyes, would have noticed something at once.

<div class="line_en">As Nancy said these words, she left the room and ran down the stairs and out into the street once more. Rose was left alone, her thoughts in great confusion, as she wondered desperately what to do and who to ask for advice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="南希说完这些话，出了房间，跑下楼，到了马路上。屋里只剩下罗斯，她的思想陷入了混乱之中。她极力地想着应该怎么办，应该向谁去请求帮助。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In less than five minutes They were in the coach on their way to the address. Rose went in first to talk to Mr Brown low alone. She was taken into his study, and polite greetings were exchanged. When They were seated again, Rose said,</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不到五分钟，他们便坐上了马车，朝着那个地址赶去。罗斯首先自己进去，单独和布朗洛先生谈话。罗斯被带进了他的书房，一番客气的寒暄之后，都落了座，这时罗斯说：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The idea came to Rose that perhaps Mr Brown low would advise her. She had been afraid to tell Nancy's story to Dr Losberne, since the good doctor was very excitable and often acted with more enthusiasm than wisdom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗斯突然想到，布朗洛先生可能会给她出点主意。她先前不敢把南希的话告诉罗斯伯恩医生，因为这个好心的老头易于激动，他往往热情有余，而考虑不周。">查看中文翻译</div>
