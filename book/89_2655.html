<div class="line_en">Bank comes home spectacularly drunk somewhere between midnight and dawn. She is carrying a pizza box from Somebody's pizzeria, and is singing songs so uncivilized that they'd make a sailor blush. Britt-Marie sits on the balcony and the dog seems to look up at her, establishing eye contact as Bank stands there swearing and fidgeting with the key in the lock. The dog almost appears to shrug its shoulders in weary resignation. Britt-Marie can empathize.</div>

<div class="line_en">The first thump from downstairs is the sound of a picture frame being knocked off the wall by Bank's stick. The second thump is followed by a splintering sound, when the frame hits the floor and the sheet of glass on a photograph of a soccer-playing girl and her father is broken and scatters all over the floor. This continues methodically for almost an hour. Bank wanders about on the ground floor, here and there, then here again, smashing all her memories, not furiously and violently but with the simple, systematic approach of grief. One by one the pictures are broken, until only empty walls and abandoned nails remain. Britt-Marie sits motionless on the balcony and wishes she could call the police. But she doesn't have Sven's telephone number.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="楼梯上传来的第一阵响动并非银行的脚步声，而是墙上的照片被银行的棍子扒拉下来的声音，接着便是相框坠地的碎裂声，蒙在足球女孩和她老爹的合影上的玻璃板摔成了碎碴，满地板都是。几乎一个小时之后，混乱的杂音才逐渐消失。银行在一楼到处乱转，一会儿这边，一会儿那边，一会儿又这边，把保留她记忆的所有照片砸个粉碎，然而手法并不暴力，也不像是在泄愤，更像是一个悲伤的人试图用简单有序的方式消灭那些引起她悲伤的回忆。相框一个接一个地碎裂，只剩空荡荡的墙壁和曾经挂着照片的钉子。布里特—玛丽静静地坐在阳台上，很想打电话报警，然而她没有斯文的电话号码。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When Britt-Marie and the dog finally dare to come downstairs, Bank is sitting on the floor in the hall, leaning against the wall. She smells of alcohol. Britt-Marie doesn't know if she's sleeping, but she's certainly not about to lift her sunglasses to check, so instead she just fetches a broom and starts sweeping up the glass. Collects all the photographs and puts them in a neat pile. Stacks the frames one against the other in a corner. Gives the dog breakfast.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布里特—玛丽和白狗终于敢下楼的时候，银行正倚着墙坐在门厅的地板上，浑身酒气。布里特—玛丽不知道她是不是睡着了，但肯定不打算掀起银行的墨镜来瞧上一瞧，所以她拿了把扫帚，开始扫地上的玻璃碴子，把破相框摞起来堆在墙角，给狗喂吃的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And then finally the noise stops. Britt-Marie stays on the balcony until she realizes Bank must have given up and gone to sleep. Shortly afterwards she hears soft steps on the stairs, a creak of her door, and then feels something touching the tips of her fingers. The dog's nose. It lies beside her, sufficiently far away not to be intrusive, but close enough for each to sense the other's presence in case of movement. After that everything is quiet until morning comes to Borg, to the extent that morning comes at all to Borg.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="噪音终于停止。确定银行放弃了破坏并且去睡觉之后，布里特—玛丽才离开阳台。过了不久，她听到楼梯上传来轻软的脚步声，接着门“吱呀”一声开了，有个东西过来碰了碰她的指尖。狗的鼻子。白狗在离她不远不近的地方躺下，距离拿捏得刚刚好，没有近到互相打扰，也没有远到感觉不到彼此的存在。此后，在晨曦再度笼罩博格之前，一切都安静得不能再安静，直到天光大亮。">查看中文翻译</div>

Britt-Marie blinks and straightens up and suddenly hears herself saying the following:</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="坐轮椅的女人在披萨店的厨房里，身上的味道和银行的一模一样，但心情比她好多了。不知道她是否注意到了布里特—玛丽手上的绷带，反正她什么都没说。她递给布里特—玛丽一封信，说是“几个镇上来的家伙”送来的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She is far too busy to concern herself with some silly letter, so she stuffs it in her bag and sets about serving coffee to the men with caps and beards, who have their heads buried in their newspapers. She doesn't ask for the crossword supplements and they don't offer her any either. Karl picks up a parcel and has some coffee. When he's done, he takes his cup to the counter, nods at Britt-Marie without looking at her and mumbles, "Thanks, that was nice."</div>

Those parcels could have anything in them. Maybe he's building a bomb. That's the sort of thing you read about. Admittedly Karl seems a taciturn sort of man who mostly keeps himself to himself and doesn't bother other people, but in fact this is precisely the sort of person neighbors describe whenever a bit of bomb-making has been going on.</div>
