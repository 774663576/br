<div class="line_en">The rain fell all that night. It made rivers of water that ran beneath the basement doors, into the kitchen, the still-room and the Pantries. We had to cut short our supper so that Mr Way and Charles might lay down sacks. I stood with Mrs Stiles at a back-stairs window, watching the bouncing raindrops and the flashes of lightning. She rubbed her arms and gazed at the sky.</div>

<div class="line_en">I went up early to Maud's rooms, and sat in the darkness, and when she came she did not know, for a minute, that I was there: she stood and put her hands to her face. Then the lightning flashed again, and she saw me, and jumped.</div>

<div class="line_en">Her eyes seemed large. She had been with her uncle, and with Gentleman. I thought, "She'll tell me now." But she only stood gazing at me, and when the thunder sounded she turned and moved away. I went with her to her bedroom. She stood as weakly for me to undress her as she had stood in Gentleman's arms, and the hand he had kissed she held off a little from her side, as if to guard it. In her bed she lay very still, but lifted her head, now and then, from her pillow. There was a steady drip, drip in one of the attics.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她眼睛大大地瞪着。刚才她跟他舅舅和绅士在一起。我想着，“她要跟你说了。”可她就是站在那儿瞪着我，当雷声响起，她转身跑开。我跟她进了卧室。她站着让我帮她更衣，跟在绅士怀里时一样柔弱。她微微扬起那只他吻过的手，仿佛想护着那只手。她静静地躺在床上，脑袋在枕头上不时地抬起来，倾听连绵不断的雨滴声，那是雨点落在一间阁楼上的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When I woke, the rain had stopped and the house was still. Maud lay, as pale as milk: her breakfast came and she put it aside and would not eat it. She spoke quietly, about nothing. She did not look or act like a lover. I thought she would say something lover-like soon, though. I supposed her feelings had dazed her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我醒来时，雨已经停了，屋子里静悄悄的。莫德躺着，象牛奶一样苍白：早餐送上来了，她不吃，推到一边。她轻言细语，说着无关紧要的话。她的样子和举动不象个恋爱中人。尽管我觉得她会用恋爱腔说些什么。我以为是她的感情令她不知所措。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But after all, she said nothing.</div>

<div class="line_en">She watched Gentleman walk and smoke his cigarette, as she always did; and then, when he had gone to Mr Lilly, she said she would like to walk, herself. The sun had come up weak. The sky was grey again, and the ground was filled with what seemed puddles of lead. The air was so washed and pure, it made me bilious. But we went, as usual, to the wood and the ice-house, and then to the chapel and the graves. When we reached her mother's grave she sat a little near it, and gazed at the stone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她一如既往地望着绅士度步，吸烟；他去见李先生后，她说她想散步。太阳升起来，天空又是灰蒙蒙的，地上都是铅色泥浆。空气清新如洗，这让我肝火旺盛。可我们还是出去了，如往常一样，我们去了树林，冰室，又去了礼拜堂和墓地。我们到她母亲的墓地后，她坐在旁边，凝视着墓碑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was dark with rain. The grass between the graves was thin and beaten. Two or three great black birds walked carefully about us, looking for worms. I watched them peck. Then I think I must have sighed, for Maud looked at me and her face -- that had been hard, through frowning -- grew gentle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="天色昏暗，快下雨了，墓地间的小草稀稀疏疏，都耷拉着。两三只大个儿的黑鸟逡巡在我们周围，它们在捉虫子吃。我看着鸟儿啄食。我想我肯定是叹了一口气，因为莫德看着我，她的表情——原本坚忍，随即变得柔和了，尽管还皱着眉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I thought of my mother, dying game on the scaffold; and I suddenly wished -- what I had never wished before -- that she had been some ordinary girl, that had died in a regular way.

<div class="line_cn" title="我还真不知道有哪个女人是让别针憋死的。莫德凝视着我，手捂着喉咙，然后她目光转向她母亲的墓。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I wish I had been stopped!" she said. She almost cried it. One of the dark birds started up from between the stones, its wings beating the air -- it sounded like a carpet being snapped out of a window. We both turned our heads to see it fly; and when I looked at her again, her eyes had tears in them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我希望我没有出生！”她说道，她几乎在叫喊。一只黑鸟在墓碑间飞起来了，翅膀呼扇着空气——听上去，象窗户里扔出来一块地毯。我们不约而同地扭头去看那只飞鸟；当我又转过来看她时，她眼里含着泪水。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Put your cloak about you," I said. Now the rain fell quick and hard. She let me lift her hood and fasten it, as a child might; and I think, if I had not drawn her from the grave, she would have stayed there and been soaked. But I made her stumble with me to the door of the little chapel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“披上斗篷，”我说道。这会儿雨点落得又急又密。她任我把她裹起来，帮她系好斗篷，象个孩子一样。我觉得，如果我不把她从墓地拽走，她还要待在那儿，全身淋湿。我带着她跌跌撞撞地奔向小礼拜堂门口。">查看中文翻译</div>

He got a special licence for the wedding there -- that meant they should not have to put out the banns -- and then he went about the county, looking out for the right kind of church. He found one, in a place so small and broken-down it had no name -- or anyway, that's what he told us. He said the vicar was a drunkard.

<div class="line_en">It made a change in me. It made me nervous and afraid. I thought she would look at me and see it -- or Gentleman would, or Margaret, or Mrs Stiles. I imagined word of it getting back to Lant Street, reaching John -- I thought of John, more than any of them. I thought of his look, his laugh. "What have I done?" I imagined I'd say. "I haven't done anything!" And I hadn't. It was only, as I've said, that I thought of her so, that I felt her so. Her very clothes seemed changed to me, her shoes and stockings: they seemed to keep her shape, the warmth and scent of her -- I didn't like to fold them up and make them flat. Her rooms seemed changed. I took to going about them -- just as I had done, on my first day at Briar -- and looking at all the things I knew she had taken up and touched. Her box, and her mother's picture. Her books. Would there be books for her, at the madhouse? Her comb, with hairs snagged in it. Would there be anyone to dress her hair? Her looking-glass. I began to stand where she liked to stand, close to the fire, and I'd study my face as I'd seen her studying hers.</div>

<div class="line_en">I knew how to do it all right, for Dainty had shown me, once. Kissing Maud, however, was not like kissing her. It was like kissing the darkness. As if the darkness had life, had a shape, had taste, was warm and glib. Her mouth was still, at first. Then it moved against mine. Then it opened. I felt her tongue. I felt her swallow. I felt -- I had done it, only to show her. But I lay with my mouth on hers and felt, starting up in me, everything I had said would start in her, when Gentleman kissed her. It made me giddy. It made me blush, worse than before. It was like liquor. It made me drunk. I drew away. When her breath came now upon my mouth, it came very cold. My mouth was wet, from hers. I said, in a whisper, "Do you feel it?"</div>

<div class="line_en">It was easy to say, in the darkness. It was easy to do. But next morning I woke, saw the strips of grey light between the curtains of the bed, remembered what I had done, and thought, My God. Maud lay, still sleeping, her brows drawn together in a frown. Her mouth was open. Her lip had grown dry. My lip was dry, too, and I brought up my hand, to touch it. Then I took the hand away. It smelt of her. The smell made me shiver, inside. The shiver was a ghost of the shiver that had seized me -- seized us both -- as I'd moved against her, in the night. Being fetched, the girls of the Borough call it. Did he fetch you --? They will tell you it comes on you like a sneeze; but a sneeze is nothing to it, nothing at all -- I shivered again, remembering. I put the tip of one finger to my tongue.

Perhaps the beer I had had with my supper had been brewed bad. Perhaps I had a fever. I washed my hands and my face. The water was so cold it seemed to sting. I washed between my legs. Then I dressed. Then I waited. I heard Maud wake, and move; and went slowly in to her. I saw her, through the space between her curtains. She had raised herself up from her pillow.

Upon her breast there was a crimson bruise, from where I had kissed too hard. I covered it up. She might have stopped me. She might have put her hands upon mine. She was the mistress, after all! But, she did nothing. I made her go with me to the silvery looking-glass above her fire, and she stood with her eyes cast down while I combed and pinned her hair. If she felt the trembling of my fingers against her face, she didn't say. Only when I had almost finished did she lift her head and catch my gaze.
