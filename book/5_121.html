<div class="line_en">The house was quiet and dark. She didn't bother turning on lights as she went from room to room, picking up toys and putting them away. She still couldn't quite believe today was going to happen. She'd waited so long, and prayed so hard, for a change in her relationship with Marah that she'd almost given up hope. Tully, and this program, had given it back to her. Even Johnny seemed optimistic. He'd done as Tully asked -- or demanded, actually -- and relinquished control over the segment. For this one broadcast, he was going to be simply an audience member, a father supporting his family.</div>
