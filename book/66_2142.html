<div class="line_en">A few seconds later, we stepped into the backyard to get Petey. He was as glad to see us as ever, leaping on us with his muddy paws, yapping excitedly, running in frantic circles through the leaves. It cheered me up just to see him.</div>

<div class="line_en">We headed down the gravel driveway toward the street, our sneakers kicking at the dead, brown leaves, Petey running in zigzags at our sides, first in front of us, then behind. "At least Dad hasn't asked us to rake all these old leaves," Josh said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们沿着碎石车道朝街走去，我们的运动鞋踢着枯叶，棕色的树叶，皮皮在我们身边曲折地跑，先在我们前面，然后在后面。乔西说：“至少爸爸没有让我们把这些老叶子都耙掉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The house next door, I noticed for the first time, was about the same size as ours, except it was shingle instead of brick. The curtains in the living room were drawn shut. Some of the upstairs windows were shuttered. Tall trees cast the neighbors' house in darkness, too.</div>

<div class="line_en">The boy had short, wavy blond hair and very pale blue eyes. He had a funny turned-up nose that seemed out of place on his serious-looking face. He was wearing a maroon long-sleeved sweatshirt despite the mugginess of the day, and black straight-legged jeans. He had a blue baseball cap stuffed into the back pocket of his jeans.</div>
