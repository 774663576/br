<div class="line_en">She could hear the dead man coming up the steps. The slow, measured sound of footsteps went before him, echoing amongst the purple pillars of her hall. Daenerys Targaryen awaited him upon the ebon bench that she had made her throne. Her eyes were soft with sleep, her silver-gold hair all tousled.</div>

<div class="line_en">"He died for me." Dany clutched her lion pelt to her chest. Underneath, a sheer white linen tunic covered her to midthigh. She had been dreaming of a house with a red door when Missandei woke her. There had been no time to dress.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dothraki were wise where horses were concerned, but could be utter fools about much else. They are only girls, besides. Her handmaids were of an age with her -- women grown to look at them, with their black hair, copper skin, and almond-shaped eyes, but girls all the same. They had been given to her when she wed Khal Drogo. It was Drogo who had given her the pelt she wore, the head and hide of a hrakkar, the white lion of the Dothraki sea. It was too big for her and had a musty smell, but it made her feel as if her sun-and-stars was still near her.</div>

<div class="line_en">The dead man's face was smooth and hairless, though his cheeks had been slashed open ear to ear. He had been a tall man, blue-eyed and fair of face. Some child of Lys or Old Volantis, snatched off a ship by corsairs and sold into bondage in red Astapor. Though his eyes were open, it was his wounds that wept. There were more wounds than she could count.</div>

Behind him followed four of his Unsullied, bearing the dead man on their shoulders. Their caps had only one spike each, and their faces showed so little they might have been cast of bronze as well.

Brothels had sprouted up like mushrooms all over Meereen. It is all they know. They need to survive. Food was more costly every day, whilst the price of flesh grew cheaper.

His hair was white, and there were crow's-feet at the corners of his pale blue eyes. Yet his back was still un-bent, and the years had not yet robbed him of his skill at arms.

<div class="line_en">"Then who, if not Unsullied? Dothraki would be even worse." Dothraki fought from horseback. Mounted men were of more use in open fields and hills than in the narrow streets and alleys of the city. Beyond Meereen's walls of many-colored brick, Dany's rule was tenuous at best. Thousands of slaves still toiled on vast estates in the hills, growing wheat and olives, herding sheep and goats, and mining salt and copper. Meereen's storehouses held ample supplies of grain, oil, olives, dried fruit, and salted meat, but the stores were dwindling. So Dany had dispatched her tiny khalasar to subdue the hinterlands, under the command of her three bloodriders, whilst Brown Ben Plumm took his Second Sons south to guard against Yunkish incursions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可若非无垢者，还能有谁？多斯拉克人只会更糟。”多斯拉克人只擅长骑马作战，更合用于旷野，而不是城中狭巷。弥林多彩的城墙之外的地界只能勉强算作她的领地。数以千计的奴隶仍在山中辛苦地放羊、采盐、挖矿、种植小麦和橄榄。城中的库房虽然储备着尚算充足的粮油、橄榄、干果和腌肉，但店中的货物却在不断减少。为此丹妮已命三位血盟卫率领卡拉萨前去征服这片腹地，并令“褐面”本·普拉姆率领“次子”佣兵团南下防范渊凯的侵袭。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The most crucial task of all she had entrusted to Daario Naharis, glib-tongued Daario with his gold tooth and trident beard, smiling his wicked smile through purple whiskers. Beyond the eastern hills was a range of rounded sandstone mountains, the Khyzai Pass, and Lhazar. If Daario could convince the Lhazarene to reopen the overland trade routes, grains could be brought down the river or over the hills at need… but the Lamb Men had no reason to love Meereen. "When the Stormcrows return from Lhazar, perhaps I can use them in the streets," she told Ser Barristan, "but until then I have only the Unsullied." Dany rose. "You must excuse me, ser. The petitioners will soon be at my gates. I must don my floppy ears and become their queen again. Summon Reznak and the Shavepate, I'll see them when I'm dressed."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="至于最重要的任务，她已交给达阿里奥·纳哈里斯——那个镶着金牙、留着三尖胡须、紫髯下一脸坏笑、口舌如簧的达阿里奥。东部丘陵以外，横亘着一条环状沙石山脉，那是雷哈撒之地，世称“凯塞通道”。如果达阿里奥能够成功说服雷哈撒人重开这条贸易通道，粮食便可经由丘陵或是沿河顺流运抵弥林。但被称为“羔羊之民”的雷哈撒人对弥林可是殊无好感。“等‘风暴之鸦’佣兵团从雷哈撒归来，或许我可以让他们在城中布防，”她对巴利斯坦爵士说道。“但在此之前，我能用的只有这些无垢者。”她转过话题道。“抱歉，爵士。请愿者们很快将至门下。我得戴上我的兔子耳朵，再次扮成他们的女王。替我把雷兹纳克和‘剃顶大人’召来，我着装之后要见他们。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Great Pyramid shouldered eight hundred feet into the sky, from its huge square base to the lofty apex where the queen kept her private chambers, surrounded by greenery and fragrant pools. As a cool blue dawn broke over the city, Dany walked out onto the terrace. To the west sunlight blazed off the golden domes of the Temple of the Graces, and etched deep shadows behind the stepped pyramids of the mighty. In some of those pyramids, the Sons of the Harpy are plotting new murders even now, and I am powerless to stop them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="八百尺高的大金字塔从雄浑的方形石基上拔地而起，直耸云霄。女王的闺房便坐落在傲立的塔顶，四周的葱葱绿意中点缀着几个芳香四溢的池塘。天刚拂晓，晴朗而清凉，丹妮信步走到露台之上。西面，阳光将仁者大殿的金色圆顶照得一片辉煌，也在贵族金字塔群身后刻下浓黑的阴影。即便此刻，“鹰身女妖之子”也一定在某座梯状金字塔内策划新的谋杀，她寻思道，我却无力制止。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Viserion sensed her disquiet. The white dragon lay coiled around a pear tree, his head resting on his tail. When Dany passed his eyes came open, two pools of molten gold. His horns were gold as well, and the scales that ran down his back from head to tail. "You're lazy," she told him, scratching under his jaw. His scales were hot to the touch, like armor left too long in the sun. Dragons are fire made flesh. She had read that in one of the books Ser Jorah had given her as a wedding gift. "You should be hunting with your brothers. Have you and Drogon been fighting again?" Her dragons were growing wild of late. Rhaegal had snapped at Irri, and Viserion had set Reznak's tokar ablaze the last time the seneschal had called. I have left them too much to themselves, but where am I to find the time for them?</div>

<div class="line_en">The garment was a clumsy thing, a long loose shapeless sheet that had to be wound around her hips and under an arm and over a shoulder, its dangling fringes carefully layered and displayed. Wound too loose, it was like to fall off; wound too tight, it would tangle, trip, and bind. Even wound properly, the tokar required its wearer to hold it in place with the left hand. Walking in a tokar demanded small, mincing steps and exquisite balance, lest one tread upon those heavy trailing fringes. It was not a garment meant for any man who had to work. The tokar was a master's garment, a sign of wealth and power.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是件非常笨拙的衣物，一块又长又松、毫无样式的布片。丹妮必须将其缠在腰上，再从腋下绕到一侧肩头，而其上晃个不停的流苏也得仔仔细细地分层展开。缠得太松，它会滑落；缠得太紧，又会显得凌乱，并且束手束脚。即便缠得不松不紧，也得一直用左手加以保持。穿着这种礼服走路只能用小碎步，否则会绊上沉重的裙裾。这不是便于工作的衣裳，而是贵族的礼服，财富和权力的象征。">查看中文翻译</div>

With Jhiqui's help, she wound the tokar about herself correctly on her third attempt. Irri fetched her crown, wrought in the shape of the three-headed dragon of her House. Its coils were gold, its wings silver, its three heads ivory, onyx, and jade. Dany's neck and shoulders would be stiff and sore from the weight of it before the day was done.

Yet some days she feared that she had not gone far enough. These Meereenese were a sly and stubborn people who resisted her at every turn. They had freed their slaves, yes… only to hire them back as servants at wages so meagre that most could scarce afford to eat. Those too old or young to be of use had been cast into the streets, along with the infirm and the crippled.

<div class="line_en">"It is your cause I find wanting, not your courtesies. I have heard your arguments so often I could plead your case myself. Shall I?" Dany leaned forward. "The fighting pits have been a part of Meereen since the city was founded. The combats are profoundly religious in nature, a blood sacrifice to the gods of Ghis. The mortal art of Ghis is not mere butchery but a display of courage, skill, and strength most pleasing to your gods. Victorious fighters are pampered and acclaimed, and the slain are honored and remembered. By reopening the pits I would show the people of Meereen that I respect their ways and customs. The pits are far-famed across the world. They draw trade to Meereen, and fill the city's coffers with coin from the ends of the earth. All men share a taste for blood, a taste the pits help slake. In that way they make Meereen more tranquil. For criminals condemned to die upon the sands, the pits represent a judgment by battle, a last chance for a man to prove his innocence." She leaned back again, with a toss of her head. "There. How have I done?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我想听的是你的理由，而不是你的恭敬。你的理由我听得太多，多得我都可以替你复述。要我试试么？”她把身子向前倾了倾。“自弥林建立之初，角斗场便是这座城市的一部分。就本质而言，此类格斗完全是宗教仪式，是献与吉斯诸神的血祭。这门艺术并非纯粹的杀戮，它展示的是勇气、技艺和力量，那些最令诸神愉悦的东西。胜者拥有盛宴、享乐与荣耀，而英勇战死的人也会得到敬意、被人怀念。如果重开角斗场，我可以向弥林人表明，我尊重他们的生活与习俗。这些角斗场举世闻名，可以为弥林带来贸易，让国库内装满世界各地的钱币。世人都有好斗之欲，角斗场可以让他们得以满足，从而使弥林更加安宁。对于死囚而言，角斗场则是血光审判之地，是还其清白的最后机会。”说到这里，丹妮拂了拂头发。“好了。我讲得如何？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">What he desired turned out to be gold. Dany had refused to compensate any of the Great Masters for the value of their slaves, but the Meereenese kept devising other ways to squeeze coin from her. The noble Grazdan had once owned a slave woman who was a very fine weaver, it seemed; the fruits of her loom were greatly valued, not only in Meereen, but in New Ghis and Astapor and Qarth. When this woman had grown old, Grazdan had purchased half a dozen young girls and commanded the crone to instruct them in the secrets of her craft. The old woman was dead now. The young ones, freed, had opened a shop by the harbor wall to sell their weavings. Grazdan zo Galare asked that he be granted a portion of their earnings. "They owe their skill to me," he insisted.

Her new husband wanted the noble gelded for the crime of rape, and he wanted a purse of gold as well, to pay him for raising the noble's bastard as his own. Dany granted him the gold, but not the gelding. "When he lay with her, your wife was his property, to do with as he would. By law, there was no rape."

<div class="line_en">In the afternoon a sculptor came, proposing to replace the head of the great bronze harpy in the Plaza of Purification with one cast in Dany's image. She denied him with as much courtesy as she could muster. A pike of unprecedented size had been caught in the Skahazadhan, and the fisherman wished to give it to the queen. She admired the fish extravagantly, rewarded the fisherman with a purse of silver, and sent the pike to her kitchens. A coppersmith had fashioned her a suit of burnished rings to wear to war. She accepted it with fulsome thanks; it was lovely to behold, and all that burnished copper would flash prettily in the sun, though if actual battle threatened, she would sooner be clad in steel.

<div class="line_en">By midday Daenerys was feeling the weight of the crown upon her head, and the hardness of the bench beneath her. With so many still waiting on her pleasure, she did not stop to eat. Instead she dispatched Jhiqui to the kitchens for a platter of flatbread, olives, figs, and cheese. She nibbled whilst she listened, and sipped from a cup of watered wine. The figs were fine, the olives even finer, but the wine left a tart metallic aftertaste in her mouth. The small pale yellow grapes native to these regions produced a notably inferior vintage. We shall have no trade in wine.
