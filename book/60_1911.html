<div class="line_en">All Franz's friends knew about Marie-Claude; they all knew about the girl with the oversized glasses. But no one knew about Sabina. Franz was wrong when he thought his wife had told her friends about her. Sabina was a beautiful woman, and Marie-Claude did not want people going about comparing their faces.</div>

<div class="line_en">Because Franz was so afraid of being found out, he had never asked for any of Sabina's paintings or drawings or even a snapshot of her. As a result, she disappeared from his life without a trace. There was not a scrap of tangible evidence to show that he had spent the most wonderful year of his life with her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因为生怕暴露，他从未向萨比娜要过油画或是素描，甚至连张证件照也没有。就这样，她从他的生活里彻底消失，不留一丝痕迹。他与她在一起度过了一生中最美好的岁月，却没有遗存任何触摸得到的证据。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a perfectly innocent form of infidelity and one eminently suited to Franz, who would never have done his bespectacled student-mistress any harm. He nourished the cult of Sabina more as religion than as love.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这种毫无恶意的不忠，正适合弗兰茨，既然他决不能伤害他那位戴眼镜的女学生。他继续崇拜着萨比娜，但那更像是一种宗教，而不是爱情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The student-mistress was much younger than Sabina, and the musical composition of her life had scarcely been outlined; she was grateful to Franz for the motifs he gave her to insert. Franz's Grand March was now her creed as well. Music was now her Dionysian intoxication. They often went dancing together. They lived in truth, and nothing they did was secret. They sought out the company of friends, colleagues, students, and strangers, and enjoyed sitting, drinking, and chatting with them. They took frequent excursions to the Alps. Franz would bend over, the girl hopped onto his back, and off he ran through the meadows, declaiming at the top of his voice a long German poem his mother had taught him as a child. The girl laughed with glee, admiring his legs, shoulders, and lungs as she clasped his neck.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="女学生比萨比娜年轻许多，她的生命乐章才刚开始，而她心怀感激之情，在其中加入了从弗兰茨身上借取的动机。弗兰茨所崇敬的伟大进军也成了她信念的一部分。同弗兰茨一样，对于她来说，音乐是狂欢式的迷醉。他们经常去跳舞。他们活在真实中，他们所做的一切不对任何人保密。他们呼朋引类，不论同事、学生还是陌生人，都高高兴兴地在一道吃饭，喝酒，聊天。他们常常去阿尔卑斯山远足。弗兰茨弯下腰，女孩跳到他背上，然后他背着她在草地上奔跑，高声吟诵着幼年时他母亲教给他的一首德文长诗。小女孩咯咯直笑，搂着他的脖子，欣赏着他的长腿、肩膀和他洪亮的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Indeed, according to the theology of that religion it was Sabina who had sent him the girl. Between his earthly love and his unearthly love, therefore, there was perfect peace. And if unearthly love must (for theological reasons) contain a strong dose of the inexplicable and incomprehensible (we have only to recall the dictionary of misunderstood words and the long lexicon of misunderstandings!), his earthly love rested on true understanding.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此外，在这一宗教里他获得了一种信义，即他年轻的情人是由萨比娜赐予他的。他的尘世之爱与超凡之爱和谐而完美。如果说超凡之爱中必然有着（就因为它是超凡的）极多难以解释和不可理解之处（请记住那些不解之词，还有那一系列的误会！），那么，他的尘世之爱则建立在真正的相互理解之上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The girl with the glasses could barely suppress her yawns, while Franz smiled blissfully at her side. The longer he looked at the pleasing gray-haired man with the admirable index finger, the more he saw him as a secret messenger, an angelic intermediary between him and his goddess. He closed his eyes and dreamed. He closed his eyes as he had closed them on Sabina's body in fifteen European hotels and one in America.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="戴眼镜的女学生坐在弗兰茨旁边，强忍着呵欠。弗兰茨却傻傻地挂着微笑。他两眼紧盯着那个头发花白的家伙，他那惊人的食指让弗兰茨倍感亲切。他心想，这个男人定是个秘密信使，是保持他与他的女神之间沟通的天使。他闭起眼睛，浮想联翩。他紧闭双眼，如同他在欧洲的十五家旅馆和美国的一家饭店的房间里，在萨比娜身上闭着双眼。">查看中文翻译</div>
