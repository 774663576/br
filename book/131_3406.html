<div class="line_en">Hannah knows nothing about that summer, of her mother's long-ago disappearance. For as long as she's been alive, the family has never spoken of it, and even if they had, it would have changed nothing. She is furious with her sister for vanishing, bewildered that Lydia would leave them all behind; knowing would only have made her more furious, more bewildered. How could you, she would have thought, when you knew what it was like? As it is, imagining her sister sinking into the lake, all she can think now is: How? And: What was it like?</div>

<div class="line_en">Tonight she will find out. Again it is two A. M. by her glow-in-the-dark clock; all night she has lain patiently, watching the numbers tick by. Today, June 1, should have been her last day of school; tomorrow Nath was supposed to walk across the stage in his blue robe and mortarboard and collect his diploma. But they're not going to Nath's commencement; neither of them has gone back to school since -- Her mind silences the thought.</div>

Although upstairs Marilyn and James and Nath all lie awake, searching for sleep, no one hears: Hannah's body knows all the secrets of silence. In the dark, her fingers slide back the bolt, then grasp the safety chain and unfasten it without rattling. This last is a new trick. Before the funeral, there was no chain.</div>

<div class="line_en">She's been practicing this for three weeks now, toying with the lock whenever her mother wasn't looking. Now Hannah oozes her body around the door and steps barefoot onto the lawn, where Lydia must have been on her last night alive. Overhead, the moon hovers behind tree branches, and the yard and the walkway and the other houses slowly appear out of the grainy dark. This is what her sister would have seen that night: glints of moonlight reflected in Mrs. Allen's windowpanes, the mailboxes all leaning slightly away. The faint glimmer of the streetlamp on the corner, where the main road loops around the lake.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她已经演习了三个星期，母亲不注意的时候，她就抓起门锁研究摆弄。汉娜慢慢溜出门去，赤着脚踏上草坪，莉迪亚生命里的最后一晚也来过这里。月亮挂在树梢后面，院子、走道和邻居家的房子缓缓消失在模糊的黑影里。那天晚上，她姐姐看到的就是这些。艾伦夫人的窗玻璃反射着点点月光，街角处的路灯昏暗朦胧，那里是环绕湖岸的大路起始的地方。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At the edge of the lawn Hannah stops, toes on the sidewalk, heels still on the grass, and pictures that thin figure marching into the shadows. She had not looked afraid. So Hannah heads straight down the middle of the road too, where the yellow line would be if their street were busy enough to need one. Through the darkened windows, the pale linings of curtains glow. There are no lights anywhere on their street, except for Mrs. Allen's front-door light, which she leaves on all the time, even during the day. When Hannah was younger, she had thought adults stayed up late every night, until two or three perhaps. She adds this to the list of things she's learned are untrue.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汉娜在草坪边缘停住脚步，脚趾踩在人行道上，脚跟还在草地上，想起那天晚上那个消失在黑暗中的瘦小身影——她看上去并不害怕。所以，汉娜也像她一样，直接走在路中间，如果这条小街足够拥挤，人们一定会在中间这里划上一条黄线。那些昏暗的窗户后面透出窗帘的模糊轮廓，小街上没有灯，只有艾伦夫人家的前门灯亮着——她总是开着这盏灯，大白天都不关。汉娜更小一些的时候，曾经以为大人每天晚上都会熬夜，直到两三点钟才睡觉。现在她知道，这种揣测并不属实。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"A beautiful location," the realtor had told James and Marilyn when they had first moved to Middlewood. Hannah has heard this story many times. "Five minutes to the grocery store and the bank. And think of it, the lake practically at your doorstep." He had glanced at Marilyn's rounded belly. "You and the kiddos can swim all summer. Like having your own private beach." James, charmed, had agreed. All her life, Hannah has loved this lake. Now it is a new place.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“一个美丽的地方。”詹姆斯和玛丽琳刚搬到米德伍德时，房地产经纪人这样对他们说。这段往事汉娜听过很多次。“五分钟就能走到湖岸，去杂货店也同样只需五分钟。想想吧，这个湖基本上就在你家门口。”他看了一眼玛丽琳浑圆的肚子，“整个夏天，你和孩子们都可以在里面游泳，好像拥有自己的私人海滩一样。”詹姆斯向往不已，欣然同意。汉娜一直爱这个湖，现在，它却变成了一个完全不同的地方。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At the corner she stops, but sees only darkness both ways, no cars. Her eyes are used to the dark now, and she darts across the main road and onto the grassy bank of the lake, but she still can't see it. Only the slope of the ground tells her that she's getting close. She passes a clump of birches, all holding their stiff arms above their heads as if in surrender. Then, suddenly, her toes find the water. Below the low thrum of a high-up airplane she hears it: a faint lapping against her ankles, soft as the sound of her own tongue in her mouth. If she looks very hard, she can see a faint shimmer, like silver tulle. Except for that, she would not have known that this was water.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她又在街角停下来，路的两个方向都黑漆漆的，没有车。她的眼睛现在已经适应了黑暗，她迅速越过大路，来到青草覆盖的湖岸，但眼睛看不到湖面，唯有脚下倾斜的地势说明她已经接近了湖水。她经过几棵桦树，它们把僵硬的胳膊伸过头顶，摆出投降一样的姿势。接着，突然之间，她的脚趾触到了水。这时，她听到有架飞机从头顶飞过，湖水拍打着她的脚踝，像舌头舔舐自己的嘴唇一样轻柔。如果非常仔细地观察，能看到水面黯淡的微光，如同一层银纱。除此之外，她不会知道这是水。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">If this were another summer, the lake would still be a lovely place. Nath and Lydia would don swimsuits and spread towels across the grass. Lydia, gleaming with baby oil, would stretch out in the sun. If Hannah were very lucky, she would be allowed to rub a squirt of oil on her own arms, to retie the strings of Lydia's bikini after she had tanned her back. Nath would cannonball off the dock, spraying a fine mist that would bead up on their skin like pearls. On the very best days -- though those were very, very rare -- their parents would come, too. Their father would practice his breaststroke and his Australian crawl, and if he was in a good mood, he'd take Hannah out over her head, steadying her as she kicked. Their mother, shaded by a huge sun hat, would look up from her New Yorker when Hannah returned to the towel and let her curl quietly against her shoulder to peep at the cartoons. These things happened only at the lake.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果放在过去的夏天，这个湖将是一如既往的可爱。内斯和莉迪亚会穿上泳衣，在草地上铺上毛巾，身上涂着婴儿护肤油的莉迪亚会躺在上面晒太阳。如果汉娜非常幸运的话，莉迪亚会允许她在自己的胳膊上也涂一些油，等莉迪亚把脊背晒黑以后，让自己帮她重新系好比基尼的带子。内斯会从码头上发射“炮弹”，溅起一片水雾，让珍珠般的水滴砸在她们的皮肤上。在最晴朗的天气——尽管这样的机会非常非常罕见，他们的父母也会来。父亲会在湖里练习蛙泳和澳大利亚式爬泳，要是他心情好，还会教汉娜游泳，在她乱踢的时候稳住她的身体。他们的母亲，戴着一顶巨大的太阳帽，当汉娜回到毛巾这儿时，她会从《纽约客》上抬起头来，让汉娜安静地靠着她的肩膀，看杂志里的漫画。这些场景只会在湖边发生。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The dock, smoothed by years of use, is the same silvery-gray by moonlight that it is in the day. At the end one small lamp, set on a post, stretches its light over a thin circle of the water. She will set out in the boat, as Lydia must have. She will row to the middle of the lake, where her sister somehow ended up, and peer down into the water. Maybe then she'll understand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="经年使用使得码头表面已经变得非常光滑，月光也给它笼上了一层银辉。码头一端的木桩上面有一盏灯，在水面上投射出一个光圈。她要到船上去，像莉迪亚那样。她会划着船到湖中央，她姐姐就是在那里终结生命的。她要凝视湖水深处，也许这样试试，她就能够明白一切。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hannah sinks back onto her heels and imagines her sister kneeling to unknot the rope, then pushing the boat away from the shore, so far out you couldn't tell the water from the darkness around it. At last she lies down on the dock, rocking herself gently, looking up into the night sky. It is as close to her sister's last night as she can get.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汉娜跪坐在脚跟上，想象着姐姐跪下来解开缆绳，然后把船推离岸边，推出很远很远，以至于根本看不清小船周围黑暗的水面。最后，她躺在码头上，轻轻地摇晃着身子，望着头顶的夜空。那天晚上，这片夜幕和她姐姐的距离应该也是如此接近。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She lies still for a long time, picturing her sister on the lake bed. Her face would point straight up, like this, studying the underside of the water. Her arms would stretch out, like this, as if she were embracing the whole world. She would listen and listen, waiting for them to come and find her. We didn't know, Hannah thinks. We would have come.</div>

<div class="line_en">They won't go to the lake this summer at all; they will never go again. She knows without having to ask. Her father has spent the past three weeks in his office, although the university had offered to have someone else finish out the term. Her mother has spent hours and hours in Lydia's room, looking and looking at everything but touching nothing. Nath roams the house like a caged beast, opening cupboards and shutting them, picking up one book after another, then tossing them down again. Hannah doesn't say a word. These are the new rules, which no one has outlined but which she already knows: Don't talk about Lydia. Don't talk about the lake. Don't ask questions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="今年夏天他们不会来湖边了，而且永远都不会来了——不用问她也知道。尽管大学已经找人代替詹姆斯完成这学期的工作，但是过去三周，她父亲天天都在办公室。她母亲在莉迪亚房间里一待就是好几个小时，盯着每一样东西看，却什么都不碰。内斯在房子里踱来踱去，仿佛笼中的困兽，他打开碗橱再猛地关上，拿起一本本的书，再把它们扔到地上。对于这些，汉娜一言不发。虽然没人刻意制定规矩，但她已经知道，家里的新规矩是：别提莉迪亚，别提那个湖，别问问题。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Back home, Hannah tiptoes into Lydia's room and shuts the door. Then she lifts the dust ruffle and pulls out the slim velvet box hidden beneath the bed. Under the tent of Lydia's blanket, she opens the box and pulls out a silver locket. Their father had given it to Lydia for her birthday, but she had tucked it under her bed, letting the velvet grow shaggy with dust.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="回到家，汉娜踮着脚走进莉迪亚房间，关上门。她掀起床围子，从床底拖出一只细长的丝绒盒子，然后用莉迪亚的毯子支了个帐篷，躲在里面打开盒子，拿出一个银挂坠，这是父亲送给莉迪亚的生日礼物，但她把它塞到了床底下，丝绒盒子上逐渐落满了灰尘。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The necklace is broken now but, anyway, Hannah has promised Lydia that she will never put it on, and she does not break promises to people she loves. Even if they aren't alive anymore. Instead she rubs the fine chain between her fingers like a rosary. The bed smells like her sister sleeping: a warm and musky and sharp smell -- like a wild animal -- that emerged only when she was deep in slumber. She can almost feel the imprint of her sister's body in the mattress, wrapping her like a hug. In the morning, when the sunlight comes through the window, she remakes the bed and replaces the locket and returns to her room. Without thinking, she knows she will do this again the next night, and the next, and the next, smoothing the blanket when she wakes, stepping carefully over the scattered shoes and clothes as she makes her way to the door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="与挂坠相连的项链已经脱落了，但汉娜答应过莉迪亚，她不会把它再接回挂坠上，她从来信守对自己爱的人许下的承诺，即使他们已经不在世上。她摩挲着精细的链子，仿佛那是一条玫瑰念珠。床上的味道和她姐姐睡着了的时候一样，暖烘烘的麝香味——犹如野生动物——只在熟睡时散发出来。她几乎能够感觉到莉迪亚的身体在床垫上压出的凹陷，像是在拥抱她。早晨，阳光从窗户照射进来，她整理了床铺，把挂坠放回原处，返回自己房间。她想也没想就明白，今天晚上自己还要再试一次，还有明晚、明晚的明晚。她睁开眼睛，把毯子推到一边，小心地越过散落在地上的鞋子和衣服，向门口走去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He had wanted to say what had been growing in his mind for days: what had happened to Lydia was nothing they could lock out or scare away. Then the look on Marilyn's face stopped him: sad, and frightened, but angry too, as if he were to blame for something. For a moment she seemed like a different woman, a stranger. He had swallowed hard and touched his collar, buttoning it over his throat. "Well," he said, "I'm going in to school. My summer class." When he leaned in to kiss her, she flinched away as if his touch burned. On the front porch, the paperboy had deposited a newspaper. Local Family Lays Daughter to Rest.</div>

<div class="line_en">James sighs, a deep trembling sigh, as if he's struggling to lift a very heavy weight. For the past three weeks Marilyn has been saying things like this. The morning after the funeral he woke up just after sunrise and everything came rushing back to him -- the glossy casket, Louisa's skin slick against his, the soft little moan she had made as he climbed atop her -- and he suddenly felt grimy, as if he were caked with mud. He turned the shower on hot, so hot he couldn't stand still beneath it and had to keep turning, like something on a spit, offering the steaming spray a new patch of flesh again and again. It hadn't helped. And when he came out of the bathroom, a faint scratching noise led him to the bottom of the stairs, where Marilyn was installing the chain on the front door.</div>

He has been wrestling with the idea of calling the police himself, of telling them about Jack and how he must be responsible. In another town, or another time, they might have shared Nath's suspicions already. Or if Lydia herself had been different: a Shelley Brierley, a Pam Saunders, a Karen Adler, a normal teenage girl, a girl they understood. The police might have looked at Jack more closely, pieced together a history of small complaints: teachers protesting graffitied desks and insolent remarks, other brothers taking umbrage at his liberties with their sisters. They might have listened to Nath's complaints -- after school all spring every day -- and come to similar conclusions. A girl and a boy, so much time together, alone -- it would not be so hard to understand, after all, why Nath eyed Jack so closely and bitterly. They, like Nath, might have found suspicious signs in everything Jack has ever said or done.</div>

<div class="line_en">But they won't. It complicates the story, and the story -- as it emerges from the teachers and the kids at school -- is so obvious. Lydia's quietness, her lack of friends. Her recent sinking grades. And, in truth, the strangeness of her family. A family with no friends, a family of misfits. All this shines so brightly that, in the eyes of the police, Jack falls into shadow. A girl like that and a boy like him, who can have -- does have -- any girl he wants? It is impossible for them to imagine what Nath knows to be true, let alone what he himself imagines. To his men, Officer Fiske often says, "When you hear hoofbeats, think horses, not zebras." Nath, they would have said, is only hysterical. Hearing zebras everywhere. Now, face-to-face with the police, Nath can see that there is no point in mentioning Jack at all: they have already decided who is to blame.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但他们不会这样做，这样只会使简单的事实复杂化，根据老师和学生所说的，可以得出非常明显的结论：莉迪亚安静孤僻，缺少朋友，她最近的成绩直线下降。她的家庭也很奇怪，没有朋友，与环境格格不入。这些金光闪闪的事实蒙蔽了警察的眼睛，让他们看不到阴影中的杰克。他们觉得，她那样一个女孩，他这样一个男孩，怎么可能在一起？他想要什么样的女孩会没有？所以，警察根本没有顺着内斯的思路去想的必要，更何况，那些只是他的想象，没有证据。菲斯克警官经常对下属说：“如果你听到蹄子响，要想到马，而不是斑马。”所以，他们只会觉得内斯得了臆想症，以为斑马到处都有。现在，面对警察，内斯发现根本没有必要提到杰克，警察已经决定了谁该负责。">查看中文翻译</div>

Sometimes they bicker over who forgot to screw the cap back onto the toothpaste, or who left the kitchen light on all night, but afterward her mother squeezes her father's hand, or her father kisses her mother's cheek, and all is well again.

From those two syllables -- kowtow -- explode bent-backed coolies in cone hats, pigtailed Chinamen with sandwiched palms. Squinty and servile. Bowing and belittled.

<div class="line_en">He drops his crumpled napkin at his empty place and pushes his chair from the table with a screech. "I have class at ten," he says. Below the hem of the tablecloth, Hannah watches her father's stocking feet -- a tiny hole just forming at one heel -- retreat toward the garage stairs. There's a pause as he slips on his shoes, and a moment later, the garage door rumbles open. Then, as the car starts, Marilyn snatches the teacup from the sink and hurls it to the floor. Shards of china skitter across the linoleum. Hannah stays absolutely still as her mother runs upstairs and slams her bedroom door, as her father's car backs out of the driveway with a mechanical little whine and growls away. Only when everything is completely quiet does she dare to crawl out from under the tablecloth, to pick the fragments of porcelain from the puddle of soapy water.</div>

Somewhere in the center of this circle his daughter, friendless and alone, must have dived into the water in despair. Lydia was very happy, Marilyn had said. Someone is responsible. Someone, James thinks, and a deep spike carves its way down his throat. He cannot bear to see the lake again. And then he knows where he wants to be.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而汉娜的直觉总是准确的。开出车道以后，詹姆斯也被那个湖吸引了过去。他围着它转了好几圈，玛丽琳的话言犹在耳。对着警察叩头。这句话在他的脑子里不断回响，他听得出她语气里不加掩饰的厌恶和藐视。但他不能怪她。莉迪亚怎么会快乐？李在学校里非常显眼，然而，似乎很少有人了解她。不排除自杀的可能。他经过那个码头——莉迪亚可能就是从那里爬上了船——经过他家所在的那条小街，街那头是死胡同，又经过码头……这个圈中间的某个地方，站着他的女儿，没有朋友，形单影只，她一定是绝望地跳进了水里。“莉迪亚很快乐，”玛丽琳说，“总得有人负责。”总得有人，詹姆斯想，他觉得喉咙里仿佛楔进了一根木桩，再也不想看到那个湖，然后，他才想起自己要去哪里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">What Marilyn has been doing is pacing Lydia's room, tingling with fury. It's obvious what the police think, with all their hinting: No evidence of anyone in the boat with her. Would you say Lydia was a lonely girl? It's obvious, too, that James agrees. But her daughter could not have been so unhappy. Her Lydia, always smiling, always so eager to please? Sure, Mom. I'd love to, Mom. To say she could have done such a thing to herself -- no, she had loved them too much for that. Every single night, before she went up to bed, she found Marilyn wherever she was -- in the kitchen, in the study, in the laundry room -- and looked her full in the face: I love you, Mom. See you tomorrow. Even that last night she had said it -- tomorrow -- and Marilyn had given her a quick squeeze and a little smack on the shoulder and said, "Hurry up now, it's late." At this thought, Marilyn sinks to the carpet. If she had known, she'd have held Lydia a little longer. She would have kissed her. She would have put her arms around her daughter and never let go.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽琳在家做的是在莉迪亚房间里愤怒地走来走去。警察显然是这样想的：“没有证据说明船上除了她还有过别的人”“你们觉得莉迪亚是个孤独的孩子吗？”这很明显，詹姆斯也同意。但是，她女儿或许没有那么不快乐。她的莉迪亚总是面带微笑，总是热切地想要取悦她。当然，妈妈。我愿意，妈妈。至于说她会自己做出那样的事——不，她太爱他们了，不可能那样做。每天晚上，莉迪亚上床之前都会先去找玛丽琳，无论她在哪里——厨房、书房、洗衣间——然后看着她的脸说：“我爱你，妈妈。明天见。”连最后那天晚上，她也说了——“明天见”——玛丽琳迅速拥抱了她一下，拍拍她的肩：“快睡吧，不早了。”想到这些，玛丽琳瘫倒在地毯上。要是她知道，她会多拥抱莉迪亚一会儿。她会亲吻她，胳膊搂着她，永远不放她走。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In Louisa's bed, he can stop thinking -- about Lydia, about the headlines, about the lake. About what Marilyn must be doing at home. About who is responsible. He focuses on the curve of Louisa's back and the pale silk of her thighs and the dark sweep of her hair, which brushes his face again and again and again. Afterward, Louisa wraps her arms around him from behind, as if he is a child, and says, "Stay." And he does.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在路易莎的床上，他无法不想到莉迪亚——想到那些新闻标题，那个湖，玛丽琳在家做什么，谁又该负责。他试图把注意力放在路易莎肩背的曲线、苍白光滑的大腿和乌黑的头发上，她的头发不停地扫着他的脸。事后，路易莎从后面拥抱着他，把他当成孩子一样，说：“留下。”他同意了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She drops both, as if she has found a snake, and pushes the bookbag out of her lap with a thud. They must belong to someone else, she thinks; they could not be Lydia's. Her Lydia did not smoke. As for the condoms --</div>

<div class="line_en">Lydia's bookbag lies slouched against her desk, where the police had left it after they'd searched it, and Marilyn pulls it into her lap. It smells of rubber erasers, of pencil shavings, of spearmint gum -- precious, schoolgirl smells. In her embrace, books and binders shift under the canvas like bones under skin. She cradles the bag, sliding the straps over her shoulders, letting its weight hug her tight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莉迪亚的书包依旧摊放在桌子上，警察调查完情况后，把它原封不动留在了那里。玛丽琳把书包拿到自己膝盖上，它有一股橡皮擦、铅笔屑和薄荷口香糖的味道——可爱的女学生的味道。在玛丽琳的怀抱中，帆布包里的书本和活页夹仿佛变成皮肤下的骨骼血肉，她摇晃着书包，把包带缠在肩膀上，让它的重量紧紧拥抱着自己。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then, in the half-unzipped front pocket, she spots something: a flash of red and white. Hidden beneath Lydia's pencil case and a bundle of index cards, a slit gapes in the lining of the bag. A small tear, small enough to slip by the busy policemen, intended to escape an even sharper eye: a mother's. Marilyn works her hand inside and pulls out an open package of Marlboros. And, beneath that, she finds something else: an open box of condoms.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，她在书包前面那个拉链半开的口袋里看到了什么东西，一道红白相间的闪光。莉迪亚的铅笔盒和一捆索引卡下面，书包的衬里出现了一道裂口。这条裂缝很小，足以逃过警察的眼睛，但躲不过母亲的审视。玛丽琳把手伸进去，掏出一包开了封的万宝路香烟，烟盒下面还有其他东西：一盒打开过的安全套。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At the lake, Nath and Hannah settle on the grass and stare out over the water in silence, hoping for the same enlightenment. On a normal summer day, at least half a dozen kids would be splashing in the water or jumping off the pier, but today, the lake is deserted. Maybe the kids are afraid to swim now, Nath thinks. What happened to bodies in the water? Did they dissolve, like tablets? He doesn't know, and as he contemplates the possibilities, he is glad that his father allowed no one to see Lydia's body but himself.</div>

<div class="line_en">Inside, Marilyn cannot quite convince herself. That first afternoon, the police had asked, "Does Lydia have a boyfriend?" and she had answered, without hesitation, "She's barely sixteen." Now she looks down at the two tiny boxes, caught in the hammock of her skirt, and the outlines of Lydia's life -- so sharp and clear before -- begin to waver. Dizzy, she rests her head against the side of Lydia's desk. She will find out everything she doesn't know.

<div class="line_en">"To talk to Jack." In truth he's not sure what he's going to do. He's never been in a fight before -- he's skinnier and shorter than most of the boys in his class -- but he has vague visions of grabbing Jack by the front of his T-shirt and pinning him to a wall, of Jack suddenly admitting his culpability. It was my fault: I lured her, I persuaded her, I tempted her, I disappointed her. Hannah lunges forward and grabs his wrist.</div>

Only when Hannah sits up and waves to someone does he emerge from his daze, his attention slowly centering on the street: Jack, in a faded blue T-shirt and jeans, walking home from graduation with a robe slung over his arm -- as if it were just an ordinary day. Nath hasn't seen him since the funeral, though he's been peeking out at Jack's house two or three times a day. As Jack spots Nath, his face changes. He looks away, quickly, as if pretending he hasn't seen either of them, and walks faster. Nath pushes himself to his feet.</div>
