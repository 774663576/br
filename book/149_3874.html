<div class="line_en">He made a sweeping gesture. "Here in this house a great number of my family had gathered. It was the loathsome annual dinner. It was a tradition which my father's father introduced and which generally turned into pretty detestable affairs. The tradition came to an end in the eighties, when Martin simply decreed that all discussions about the business would take place at regular board meetings and by voting. That's the best decision he ever made."</div>

<div class="line_en">"At 2:15, a few minutes after Harriet came home, a dramatic accident occurred out there on the bridge. A man called Gustav Aronsson, brother of a farmer at Östergården -- a smallholding on Hedeby Island -- turned on to the bridge and crashed head-on with an oil truck. Evidently both were going too fast and what should have been a minor collision proved a catastrophe. The driver of the truck, presumably instinctively, turned his wheel away from the car, hit the railing of the bridge and the tanker flipped over; it ended up across the bridge with its trailer hanging over the edge. One of the railings had been driven into the oil tank and flammable heating oil began spurting out. In the meantime Aronsson sat pinned inside his car, screaming in pain. The tanker driver was also injured but managed to scramble out of his cabin."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“两点十五分，海莉刚回家不久，那桥上发生一桩可怕的意外。出事的是一个叫古斯塔·阿朗松的人，他哥哥是海泽比岛上一块小自耕农地‘东园’的农夫。他上桥之后和一辆油罐车相撞，双方显然都开得太快，原本应该只是小擦撞却酿成大祸。油罐车司机大概是出于本能想闪车，不料撞上桥的护栏，整辆车翻覆，最后横切到桥面另一侧，拖车垂挂在桥的边缘。有一段护栏撞穿油槽，易燃的高温油料开始往外喷。这时候阿朗松被困在车内，痛得大喊。油罐车司机也受了伤，但好不容易从驾驶座爬出来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Wait. Let me tell you what happened. It was a Saturday, as I said. It was also the day of the party, with the Children's Day parade that was arranged by the sports club in Hedestad. Harriet had gone into the town during the day and watched the parade with some of her schoolfriends. She came back here to Hedeby Island just after 2:00 in the afternoon. Dinner was supposed to begin at 5:00, and she was expected to take part along with the other young people in the family."</div>

<div class="line_en">"We tried to prise him loose with our bare hands, and that didn't work. He would have to be cut or sawed out, but we couldn't do anything that risked striking a spark; we were standing in the middle of a sea of oil next to a tanker truck lying on its side. If it had exploded we would have all been killed. It took a long time before we could get help from the mainland side; the truck was wedged right across the bridge, and climbing over it would have been the same as climbing over a bomb."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们试着徒手把他拖出来，但行不通，只能用切或锯的方法，偏偏又不能冒险擦出任何火花。我们就站在一片油海当中，货车侧翻在旁，万一爆炸，我们全都死定了。要获得大陆方面的援助必须花费很长的时间；货车横卡在桥面，要想爬过去无异于爬过一颗炸弹。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The accident actually had nothing to do with Harriet. But it was significant in a crucial way. A shambles ensued: people on both sides of the bridge hurried to try to help; the risk of fire was significant and a major alarm was sounded. Police officers, an ambulance, the rescue squad, the fire brigade, reporters and sightseers arrived in rapid succession. Naturally all of them assembled on the mainland side; here on the island side we did what we could to get Aronsson out of the wreck, which proved to be damnably difficult. He was pinned in and seriously injured.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这桩意外其实与海莉无关，却扮演着非常关键的角色。当下现场乱成一团：桥两端的民众都赶来想要帮忙；由于火灾随时可能一触即发，因此警局发出紧急警报声。警员、救护车、救援小组、消防队、记者全都迅速地陆续抵达，还有许多旁观群众。当然了，他们全都聚集在大陆那端，至于在岛上这端，我们则尽力想把阿朗松拖出损毁的车，但实在非常困难。他根本动弹不得而且受了重伤。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"What matters about the accident is that the bridge was blocked for twenty-four hours. Not until Sunday evening was the last of the oil pumped out, and then the truck could be lifted up by crane and the bridge opened for traffic. During these twenty-four hours Hedeby Island was to all intents and purposes cut off from the rest of the world. The only way to get across to the mainland was on a fireboat that was brought in to transport people from the small-boat harbour on this side to the old harbour below the church. For several hours the boat was used only by rescue crews -- it wasn't until quite late on Saturday night that stranded islanders began to be ferried across. Do you understand the significance of this?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这桩意外的重点是桥面有二十四小时不能通行。直到星期日傍晚抽出最后一滴油之后，才能用吊车将油罐车吊起，桥也才开放通行。在这二十四小时当中，海泽比岛几乎可以说完全对外隔绝，若想到对岸大陆只能搭消防艇，那是专门载人从这头的游艇码头到教堂底下的旧码头去的。有好几个小时，消防艇都只供救难人员使用，直到星期六夜深之后才开始载运受困的岛民。你明白这意味着什么吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Harriet had previously lived in a house across the road, but given that neither Gottfried nor Isabella was consistently stable, and one could clearly see how that upset the girl, undermined her studies and so on, in 1964, when she was fourteen, I arranged for her to move into my house. Isabella probably thought that it was just fine to be spared the responsibility for her daughter. Harriet had been living here for the past two years. So this is where she came that day. We know that she met and exchanged some words with Harald in the courtyard -- he's one of my older brothers. Then she came up the stairs, to this room, and said hello to me. She said that she wanted to talk to me about something. Right then I had some other family members with me and I couldn't spare the time for her. But she seemed anxious and I promised I'd come to her room when I was free. She left through that door, and that was the last time I saw her. A minute or so later there was the crash on the bridge and the bedlam that followed upset all our plans for the day."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“海莉原本住在马路对面的屋子里，但因为戈弗里和伊莎贝拉情绪都不稳定，那孩子的心情明显受到影响，学业成绩也退步，所以一九六四年她十四岁时，我便让她搬来和我同住。这么做很可能正中伊莎贝拉下怀，让她不必再尽母亲之责。这两年来，海莉都住在这里，所以那天她是回这里来。我们知道她在院子碰见哈洛德聊了几句——他是我另一个哥哥。后来她上楼到这个房间跟我打招呼，她说有话跟我讲，当时有几个亲戚跟我在一起，我脱不了身，但她似乎很心急，于是我答应她一忙完就到她房间去。她从那扇门离开，之后我再也没见到她。约莫一分钟后，桥上便出车祸，接下来的骚动把我们那天的计划全打乱了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

If we also include children and unmarried guests, all in all about forty family members arrived in the course of the day. Along with servants and residents, there were sixty-four people either here or near the farm. Some of them -- the ones who were going to spend the night -- were busy getting settled in neighbouring farms or in guest rooms.</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's more complicated than that, and I have to tell the story in chronological order. When the accident occurred, people dropped whatever they were doing and ran to the scene. I was…I suppose I took charge and was feverishly occupied for the next few hours. Harriet came down to the bridge right away -- several people saw her -- but the danger of an explosion made me instruct anyone who wasn't involved in getting Aronsson out of his car to stay well back. Five of us remained. There were myself and my brother Harald. There was a man named Magnus Nilsson, one of my workers. There was a sawmill worker named Sixten Nordlander who had a house down by the fishing harbour. And there was a fellow named Jerker Aronsson. He was only sixteen, and I should really have sent him away, but he was the nephew of Gustav in the car.</div>

<div class="line_en">"At 2:55 Harriet crossed the courtyard. She was seen by Isabella. About a minute later she ran into Otto Falk, the pastor in Hedeby. At that time the parsonage was where Martin Vanger has his villa today, and the pastor lived on this side of the bridge. He had been in bed, nursing a cold, when the accident took place; he had missed the drama, but someone had telephoned and he was on his way to the bridge. Harriet stopped him on the road and apparently wanted to say something to him, but he waved her off and hurried past. Falk was the last person to see her alive."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“两点五十五分，海莉穿过院子，伊莎贝拉看到她。大约一分钟后，她遇上海泽比的牧师奥图·法尔克。当时的牧师住所就在今天马丁的别墅所在地，因此牧师住在桥的这一头。车祸发生时，他因为感冒正躺在床上养病；他没见到惨剧，不过接到电话通知后，正要前往桥边。海莉半路将他拦下，显然想说些什么，但他挥挥手没有多加理会便匆匆离去。法尔克是最后见到她活着的人。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don't know," Vanger said with a troubled expression. "We didn't get Aronsson out of his car until around 5:00-- he survived, by the way, although he was not in good shape -- and sometime after 6:00 the threat of fire was considered past. The island was still cut off, but things began to calm down. It wasn't until we sat down at the table to have our longdelayed dinner around 8:00 that we discovered Harriet was missing. I sent one of the cousins to get Harriet from her room, but she came back to say that she couldn't find her. I didn't think much about it; I probably assumed she had gone for a walk or she hadn't been told that dinner was served. And during the evening I had to deal with various discussions and arguments with the family. So it wasn't until the next morning, when Isabella went to find her, that we realised that nobody knew where Harriet was and that no-one had seen her since the day before." He spread his arms out wide. "And from that day, she has been missing without a trace."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不知道。”范耶尔神情痛苦地说：“我们直到五点才把阿朗松弄出车外——顺带一提，他没死，不过情况不太好。六点过后，火灾威胁才被视为解除。岛的对外交通仍然中断，但情况已渐渐恢复平静。一直到八点左右，我们终于坐下来吃那顿延误许久的晚餐时，才发现海莉不见了。我叫海莉的一个表姐妹到她房间叫她，她回来却说找不到人。我也没多想，以为她出去散步或是没人告诉她要吃晚饭了。整个晚上，我还得和亲戚们进行各式各样的讨论与争辩，所以直到隔天早上伊莎贝拉去找她，我们才发现没人知道海莉在哪里，而且从前一天起就没人见过她。”他将两只手臂伸展开来。“从那天起，她便消失得无影无踪。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Hedeby Island was an irregularly shaped land mass about two miles long with a maximum width of about one mile. A large part of the island was covered by forest. There was a built-up area by the bridge and around the little summer-house harbour. On the other side of the island was the smallholding, Östergården, from which the unfortunate Aronsson had started out in his car.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Remember that she couldn't have left the island," Vanger said. "Here on Hedeby Island you could die in an accident just like anywhere else. You could be struck by lightning -- but there was no thunderstorm that day. You could be trampled to death by a horse, fall down a well, or tumble into a rock crevice.

When I wasn't tending to my work I began going for walks back and forth across the island. Winter came on and we still hadn't found a trace of her. In the spring I kept on looking until I realised how preposterous my search was. When summer came I hired three experienced woodsmen who did the entire search over again with dogs. They combed every square foot of the island. By that time I had begun to think that someone must have killed her. So they also searched for a grave. They worked at it for three months. We found not the slightest vestige of the girl. It was as if she had dissolved into thin air."</div>

Consider the following: if Harriet met with an accident and drowned, logically it must have occurred somewhere in the immediate vicinity of the village.

We dragged almost all the spots where she could conceivably have gone down to the water. I also hired young men from a scuba-diving club here in Hedestad.

Below the parsonage one rowing boat was on shore and one in the water. By Östergården there was a rowing boat and a motorboat.

<div class="line_en">The first chapter was a sort of declaration of war in which Blomkvist did not mince words. In the last twenty years, Swedish financial journalists had developed into a group of incompetent lackeys who were puffed up with self-importance and who had no record of thinking critically. He drew this conclusion because time after time, without the least objection, so many financial reporters seemed content to regurgitate the statements issued by CEOs and stock-market speculators -- even when this information was plainly misleading or wrong. These reporters were thus either so naive and gullible that they ought to be packed off to other assignments, or they were people who quite consciously betrayed their journalistic function. Blomkvist claimed that he had often been ashamed to be called a financial reporter, since then he would risk being lumped together with people whom he did not rate as reporters at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第一章开门见山，有点宣战的味道。过去二十年间，瑞典财经记者成了一群自以为是、毫无批判思考能力的无能马屁精。他之所以下此结论，是因为有太多财经记者一次又一次毫无异议地直接引述各公司总裁与股市投机客的发言，即使该讯息根本是误导或错误也无所谓。这些记者若非过于天真容易受骗——那么理应被分配其他采访任务——就是故意违背记者的职责。布隆维斯特声称自己经常因为被称为财经记者感到羞耻，在他眼里，这些人根本不配当记者，而他却可能被当成同一伙人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He compared the efforts of financial journalists with the way crime reporters or foreign correspondents worked. He painted a picture of the outcry that would result if a legal correspondent began uncritically reproducing the prosecutor's case as gospel in a murder trial, without consulting the defence arguments or interviewing the victim's family before forming an opinion of what was likely or unlikely. According to Blomkvist the same rules had to apply to financial journalists.</div>

<div class="line_en">The rest of the book consisted of a chain of evidence to support his case. One long chapter examined the reporting of a famous dot-com in six daily papers, as well as in the Financial Journal, Dagens Industri, and "A-ekonomi," the business report on Swedish TV. He first quoted and summarised what the reporters had said and written. Then he made a comparison with the actual situation. In describing the development of the company he listed time after time the simple questions that a serious reporter would have asked but which the whole corps of financial reporters had neglected to ask. It was a neat move.</div>

<div class="line_en">If a parliamentary reporter handled his assignment by uncritically taking up a lance in support of every decision that was pushed through, no matter how preposterous, or if a political reporter were to show a similar lack of judgement -- that reporter would be fired or at the least reassigned to a department where he or she could not do so much damage. In the world of financial reporting, however, the normal journalistic mandate to undertake critical investigations and objectively report findings to the readers appears not to apply. Instead the most successful rogue is applauded. In this way the future of Sweden is also being created, and all remaining trust in journalists as a corps of professionals is being compromised.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="假如国会记者不分青红皂白，不管国会强行通过多么荒谬的提案都毫无异议地予以支持，又或是政治记者也同样缺乏判断力，该记者若非被解雇也至少会被转往其他部门，以免造成太大的损害。然而在财经新闻界，记者严密调查、客观报道的正常职责却似乎并不适用，受表扬的反而是最成功的恶棍。这不只决定了瑞典的未来，也破坏了其他记者的专业形象与民众仅剩的信任。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Another chapter dealt with the IPO of Telia stock -- it was the book's most jocular and ironic section, in which some financial writers were castigated by name, including one William Borg, to whom Blomkvist seemed to be particularly hostile. A chapter near the end of the book compared the level of competence of Swedish and foreign financial reporters. He described how serious reporters at London's Financial Times, the Economist, and some German financial newspapers had reported similar subjects in their own countries. The comparison was not favourable to the Swedish journalists. The final chapter contained a sketch with suggestions as to how this deplorable situation could be remedied. The conclusion of the book echoed the introduction:</div>
