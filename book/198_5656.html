<div class="line_en">Ron was furious with Hermione too. As far as he was concerned, the stripping-down of a brand -- new Firebolt was nothing less than criminal damage. Hermione, who remained convinced that she had acted for the best, started avoiding the common room. Harry and Ron supposed she had taken refuge in the library and didn't try to persuade her to come back. All in all, they were glad when the rest of the school returned shortly after New Year, and Gryffindor Tower became crowded and noisy again.</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry knew that Hermione had meant well, but that didn't stop him from being angry with her. He had been the owner of the best broom in the world for a few short hours, and now, because of her interference, he didn't know whether he would ever see it again.

<div class="line_en">Classes started again the next day. The last thing anyone felt like doing was spending two hours on the grounds on a raw January morning, but Hagrid had provided a bonfire full of salamanders for their enjoyment, and they spent an unusually good lesson collecting dry wood and leaves to keep the fire blazing while the flame-loving lizards scampered up and down the crumbling, white-hot logs. The first Divination lesson of the new term was much less fun; Professor Trelawney was now teaching them palmistry, and she lost no time in informing Harry that he had the shortest life line she had ever seen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天，学校开始上课了。寒冷的一月份上午在操场上待两个小时，这是大家最不愿意做的事了；但海格升起了一堆大火，里面都是火怪，让大家取乐，而且学生们上了一节好得非同寻常的课，收集枯枝败叶来保持火势，喜爱火焰的蜥蜴在烧得碎裂、白热的木块上蹿来跳去。新学期的第一节占卜课可就比这差劲多了：特里劳妮教授现在教他们手相学，她不失时机地告诉哈利，他手上的生命线是她所曾见过的最短的。">查看中文翻译</div>

Professor Lupin continued, "The Patronus is a kind of positive force, a projection of the very things that the dementor feeds upon -- hope, happiness, the desire to survive -- but it cannot feel despair, as real humans can, so the dementors can't hurt it. But I must warn you, Harry, that the charm might be too advanced for you. Many qualified wizards have difficulty with it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利突然想象自己蹲在海格那样的巨人后面，手里拿着一根大棒。卢平教授继续说道：“守护神是一种正面力量，它所倡导的东西正是摄魂怪的食粮——希望、快乐、活下去的愿望——但它不能像真正的人那样感到绝望，因此摄魂怪就没法伤害它。不过我必须警告你，哈利，这种咒语对你来说可能过于高深。许多资深巫师使用这种咒语时都感到困难。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Even so, he was showing the strain nearly as much as Hermione, whose immense workload finally seemed to be getting to her.
