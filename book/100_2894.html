<div class="line_en">Emma Morley eats well and drinks only in moderation. She gets eight good hours sleep, then wakes promptly and of her own accord at just before six-thirty and drinks a large glass of water -- the first 250ml of a daily 1.5 litres, which she pours from the matching glass and carafe set that stands in a shaft of morning sunlight by her double bed.</div>

<div class="line_en">The clock radio clicks on and she allows herself to lie in bed and listen to the news headlines. The Labour leader John Smith has died, and there's a report on his memorial service at Westminster Abbey; respectful cross-party tributes, "the greatest Prime Minister we never had", discreet speculation on who will replace him. Once again she reminds herself to look into the possibility of joining the Labour Party, now that her CND membership has long since lapsed.</div>

Eventually he appears in the doorway, red-faced and martyred. He is wearing no underwear and a black t-shirt that stops a little above his hips. There isn't a man in the world that can carry off this look, but even so Emma makes a conscious effort to keep her eyes focussed on his face, as he slowly blows air out through his mouth.</div>

<div class="line_en">It's a big day for Dexter Mayhew too. He lies in a tangle of damp sheets, eyes wide, and imagines all of the things that might go wrong. Tonight he is appearing on live national television in his very own TV show. A vehicle. It's a vehicle for his talents, and he is suddenly not sure that he possesses any.</div>

<div class="line_en">The previous evening he went to bed early like a small boy, alone and sober while it was still light outside in the hope of being fresh-faced and quick-witted this morning. But he has been awake for seven of the nine hours now, and is exhausted and nauseous with anxiety. The phone rings and he sits up sharply and listens to his own voice on the answering machine. "So -- talk to me!" the voice says, urbane and confident, and he thinks Idiot. Must change message.</div>

<div class="line_en">He has tried, really he has. The three of them have sat together in cinemas and cheap restaurants and dingy old boozers, Dexter meeting Emma's eyes and smiling his approval as Ian snuffles at her neck; love's young dream with a pair of pints. He has sat at the tiny kitchen table of her tiny Earls Court flat and played a game of Trivial Pursuit so savagely competitive that it was like bare-knuckle boxing. He has even joined the blokes from Sonicotronics at The Laughter Lab in Mortlake to watch Ian's observational stand-up, Emma grinning nervously at his side and nudging him so that he knows when to laugh.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他曾试着去改变，也的确努力过。他们三个曾一起坐在电影院、廉价餐厅以及邋遢的老酒馆里，伊恩嗅着爱玛的头颈时，德克斯特与她四目相交，投以赞许的笑；爱情不就是年轻的梦伴着几杯酒精？他曾坐在她伯爵宫狭小公寓里的厨房餐桌前起劲地玩棋盘游戏Trivial Pursuit，最后都恨不得发展成一场野蛮的拳击赛。他甚至还和一帮在“桑尼克电子”工作的男性为伍，一道去看了伊恩在莫雷克的话剧演出，爱玛坐在身边神情紧张地冷笑着，在爆笑场面时使劲用胳膊捅他以提醒。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But even on his best behaviour the hostility is tangible, and mutual too. Ian takes every opportunity to imply that Dexter is a fake because he happens to be in the public eye, a snob, a fop just because he prefers taxis to night buses, members' clubs to saloon bars, good restaurants to take-away. And the worst of it is that Emma joins in with the constant belittling, the reminders of his failings. Don't they appreciate how hard it is, staying decent, keeping your head on straight when so much is happening to you and your life is so full and eventful? If Dexter picks up the bill at dinner, or offers to pay for a taxi instead of the bus, the two of them mumble and mope as if he has insulted them in some way. Why can't people be pleased that he's doing so well, grateful for his generosity? That last excruciating evening -- a "vid night" on a decrepit sofa, watching Star Trek: Wrath of Khan and drinking "tinnies" while a curry leaked fluorescent ghee onto his Dries van Noten trousers -- that was the last straw. From now on if he's going to see Emma, then he's going to see her alone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而即使掩饰得再好，敌意还是会不由得流露，这敌意当然也是互相的。伊恩抓住一切机会暗示德克斯特名不副实，为人所知也全靠运气，是个自命不凡的花花公子，半夜打车而不坐公交车，偏爱会员制俱乐部而不去雅座酒吧，爱高级餐厅而拒绝外卖。最为火上浇油的是，还常来嘲笑丑化他，并且也会导致爱玛加人其中，加深了他的挫败感。（他的生活过得紧锣密鼓，也可谓历经世事，他还是能这样勇往直前，这难道不该得到赞许？）每次德克斯特打算给晚餐埋单，或是提出大家不坐公交车，出租车费他来承担时，总会惹得他们俩嘟哝，或是表现得闷闷不乐，好像他冒犯了他们。而他明明那么友好那么慷慨，怎么人家还不开心，不领情呢？他终于受不了的那个夜晚，是他们一起看夜场《星际迷航：可汗之怒》，一边喝着“网球鞋”鸡尾酒，而咖喱主菜里发亮的酥油弄脏了他的名牌裤子——成了压死骆驼的最后一根稻草。从此，他无论如何都只单独找爱玛。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Irrationally, unreasonably, he has become -- what? Jealous? No, not jealous, but resentful perhaps. He has always expected Emma to be there, a resource he can call upon at any time like the emergency services. Since the cataclysm of his mother's death last Christmas he has found himself more and more reliant on her at exactly the point that she has become less available to him. She used to return phone-calls immediately, now days go by without a word. She's been "away with Ian" she says, but where do they go? What do they do? Buy furniture together? Watch "vids"? Go to pub quizzes? Ian has even met Emma's parents, Jim and Sue. They love him, she says. Why has Dexter never met Jim and Sue? Wouldn't they love him more?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不可理喻地，毫无道理地，他变得——什么？忌妒？不，不是忌妒，也许算是憎恶。他总是希望爱玛能在场，把她当作一项呼之即来的资源、可以求助的热线。去年圣诞节时期他的母亲过世，不窗为一场大灾变，此后他发觉自己越来越依赖爱玛，偏偏她却变得忙碌而疏远。以往她总是立刻就回电话的，如今是几大也没一句回话。“和伊恩出门去了”，她会这么说，可有什么地方好去的？买家具？看“片子”？去酒馆玩竞猜游戏？她甚至带伊恩见自己的父母吉姆和苏了。他们喜欢他，她这么说。为什么德克斯特从没去见见吉姆和苏？他会不会史讨他们喜欢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Most annoyingly of all, Emma seems to be relishing this newfound independence from Dexter. He feels as if he's being taught a lesson, as if he's being slapped round the face with her newfound contentment. "You can't expect people to build their lives around you, Dexter," she has told him, gloatingly, and now they've argued once again, and all because she won't be there in the studio for the live broadcast of his show.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最让人恼火的是，对于近来摆脱了德克斯特的状态，爱玛颇有几分享受，让他有被人教训了一顿的感觉，仿佛是她新近获得的满足感在他脸上抽了一记耳光。“你不能指望别人绕着你打转，德克斯特，”她得意扬扬地对他说，如今他们又吵了一架，都是因为她不去他节目的直播现场。">查看中文翻译</div>

The newsagent smiles at his celebrity customer with a due sense of occasion, and Dexter trots home with his arms full of newspapers.

One hand picks at her BCG scar, her small, hard, pretty face bunched up tight as a fist as if to warn Emma off trying any of that seize-the-day crap. The other kids are frightened of Sonya Richards, and even Emma sometimes fears for her dinner money. It's the level stare, the rage. "I'm not saying sorry," she snaps.</div>

He treats the kids, the teachers, the whole comprehensive system as if he were a missionary who has deigned to walk among them. Last night at the dress rehearsal he had cried real tears during "Where is Love?", squeezing the high notes out like kidney stones, and Emma had found herself idly wondering what it would feel like to walk on stage, place one hand over his face and push him firmly backwards. The peasant remark is entirely in character, but even so -</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我会向他问清楚的。不过哪怕他真是说了，也只能表明他有多无知，而你也一样愚笨，因为你居然火冒三丈了。”说到“思笨”时她顿了一下，这是伊尔克利矿野上的人用的词。话要说得再市井些，“不过，嘿，要是咱们解决不了这个。牢骚，就没法演出了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

"You are smart, Sonya, so so smart, but people set these traps for you and you walk right into them." Sonya sighs, sets her face and looks out at the small rectangle of parched grass outside the science block. "You could do so well, not just in the play but in class too. Your work this term's been really intelligent and sensitive and thoughtful." Unsure how to deal with praise, Sonya sniffs and scowls. "Next term you could do even better, but you've got to control your temper, Sonya, you've got to show people you're better than that." It's another speech, and Emma sometimes thinks she expends too much energy making speeches like this. She had hoped that it might have some kind of inspirational effect, but Sonya's gaze has drifted over Emma's shoulder now, towards the classroom door. "Sonya, are you listening to me?"</div>

He's the headmaster," she tells Sonya, then beckons him in. But it's true, the first, and second words that enter her head whenever she sees Mr Godalming are "beard". It's one of those startling full-face affairs: not straggly, cut very close and neat but very, very black, a Conquistador, his blue eyes peeping out like holes cut in carpet. So he is The Beard.

<div class="line_en">When Dexter's sure he's alone he pours himself that drink and checks himself in the mirror. Bright red t-shirt worn under black dinner jacket over washed out jeans over pointed black shoes, his hair cut short and sharp, he is meant to be the picture of metropolitan male youth but suddenly he feels old and tired and impossibly sad. He presses two fingers against each eye and attempts to account for this crippling melancholy, but is having trouble with rational thought. It feels as if someone has taken his head and shaken it. Words are turning to mush and he can see no plausible way of getting through this. Don't fall apart, he tells himself, not here, not now. Hold it together.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="确信没有别人的时候，德克斯特倒上惦记了一会儿的液体，又细细地盯着镜子里的自己。黑色的正装夹克里衬着鲜红的T恤衫，洗旧的牛仔裤，尖头的黑皮鞋，一头利落的短发，这本是都市青年的模范形象，然而一瞬间他觉得自己又老又倦，而且莫名地觉得悲哀。他伸出两根手指按压双眼，试图化解忧郁，然而清醒的思维却难以唤起。感觉就好比被人揪住了脑袋摇晃。脑中的语词变得支离，他没法绕过这一切。别崩溃，他告诉自己，别在这里、这当口。打起精神。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But an hour is an impossibly long time on live TV, and he decides that he might need a little help. There's a small water bottle on his dressing table, and he empties it into the sink then, glancing at the door, takes the bottle of vodka from the drawer once again and pours three, no, four inches of the viscous liquid into the bottle and replaces the lid. He holds it up to the light. No-one would ever tell the difference and of course he's not going to drink it all, but it's there, in his hand, to help him out and get him through. The deceit makes him feel excited and confident again, ready to show the viewing public, and Emma, and his father at home just what he can do. He is not just some presenter. He is a broadcaster.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个小时的直播节目无比漫长，他觉得不妨打个盹儿，兴许会有益处。化妆台上有个小水瓶，他将里面的水倒进水池，向门口瞥了一眼后再次从抽屉里拿出伏特加酒瓶，将那黏稠的液体往水瓶里倒了三，不，四英寸高的一截，又换了个新瓶盖。他举着瓶对着光照了照，看不出同清水有何分别。他当然不会全部喝尽，不过它就在这儿，握在他手中帮他振作，帮他熬过这一关。这个小主意让他兴奋并恢复了信心，他准备好好表现一番了，面向观众以及爱玛，还有父亲。他不只是个主持人，更是个传媒人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"AWWWW! COME HERE YOU!" She wraps her arm around his head and holds it like a football. Suki Meadows is pretty and what used to be called petite, and fizzes and bubbles like a fan-heater dropped into a bath. There has been some flirtation between them recently, if you can call this flirtation, Suki pushing his face into her breast like this. Like a head-boy and head-girl, there has been some pressure for the two stars to get together, and it does sort of make sense from a professional, if not emotional point of view. She squeezes his head beneath her arm -- "YOU'RE GOING TO BE GREAT" -- then suddenly holds onto his ears and jerks his face towards her. "LISTEN TO ME. YOU'RE GORGEOUS, YOU KNOW THAT, AND WE ARE GOING TO BE SUCH A GREAT TEAM, YOU AND ME. MY MUM'S HERE TONIGHT AND SHE WANTS TO MEET YOU AFTERWARDS. BETWEEN ME AND YOU I THINK SHE FANCIES YOU. I FANCY YOU, SO SHE MUST FANCY YOU TOO. SHE WANTS YOUR AUTOGRAPH BUT YOU HAVE TO PROMISE NOT TO GET OFF WITH HER!"</div>

MAKE SOME NOISE!" Dexter stands mute on the gantry next to her, the microphone dead in his hand as he realises that he is drunk. His big break on live national television and he is sodden with vodka, dizzy with it.

There have been ovations and encores and now people are stamping on the benches and hanging off the climbing apparatus and Emma is being dragged on stage by Sonya who is crying, God, actually crying, clutching Emma's hand and saying well done, Miss, amazing, amazing. A school production, it is the smallest imaginable triumph but Emma's heart is beating in her chest and she can't stop grinning as the band play a cacophonous "Consider Yourself" and she holds the hands of fourteen-year-olds and bows and bows again. She feels the elation of doing something well, and for the first time in ten weeks she no longer wants to kick Lionel Bart.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="喝彩！似乎是她从没听过的喝彩，在整个体育馆里回荡。是的，乐队平庸，歌声嘈杂；是的，出现了几个技术问题：道具丢了、布景塌了：然而观众的宽容让人难以想象，演出大获全胜。南希之死甚至让化学部的劳特利奇先生擦鼻子抹眼洞，伦敦屋顶追逐的那一段成为整出戏的高潮，演员留下了隽永的舞台剪影，让观众屏息赞叹——那可是放焰火时才有的待遇。不出所料，索尼亚·理查兹大放光彩，被最热烈的欢呼声淹没，而马丁·道森只有冷笑切齿的份儿。喝彩声震耳，返场连连，有人踩在凳子上，有人在扶梯边流连。爱玛被热泪满面的索尼亚拽上舞台，天哪，她紧攥着爱玛的手哭着说，老师，干得漂亮，太棒了，太棒了。一出校园剧的凯歌，微不足道，然而爱玛的心还是因此狂跳，乐队荒腔走板地奏着《想想自己》时，她合不拢嘴地笑着。她同这群十四岁的孩子牵着手，一次次地鞠躬谢幕。她感到了事有所成的喜悦，她对莱昂内尔·巴特①十个星期以来的抱怨烟消云散。【注：①Lionel Bart（1930—1999），英国现代音乐剧之父， 音乐剧《奥利弗！》（根据狄更斯的状雾都孤儿》改编）的词曲作家。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Unlike most showbusiness parties it's all over by nine forty-five, and instead of a stretch limo, Emma and Ian take the 55, the 19 and the Piccadilly Line home. "I'm so proud of you --" says Ian, his head resting against hers "-- but I think it's settled on my lungs."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这次演出后的派对与众不同，九点四十五分就完全结束了。爱玛和伊恩也没有加长豪华车可坐，他们搭坐了55路和19路公交车，又换乘地铁皮卡迪里线。“我真为你骄傲…”伊恩说着，额头顶住了她的额头。“…不过我想我的肺部也感染了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At the drinks afterwards, own-brand cola flows like wine, and there are also five bottles of sparkling perry to share among the adults. Ian sits in a corner of the sports hall with a plate of mini kievs and a plastic cup of Beecham's Powders that he has brought to the party specially, and he massages his sinuses, smiles and waits patiently as Emma soaks up the praise. "Good enough for the West End!" someone says, somewhat unrealistically, and she doesn't even mind when Rodney Chance, her Fagin, boozy on spiked Panda Pops, tells her that she's "pretty fit for a teacher". Mr Godalming ("please, call me Phil") congratulates her while Fiona, ruddy-cheeked like a farmer's wife, looks on, bored and bad tempered. "We should talk, in September, about your future here," says Phil, leaning in and kissing her goodbye, causing some of the kids, and some of the staff, to make a "whoooo' noise.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="之后的酒水会上，自制的可乐美酒般流泻，还有五瓶梨子汽酒供成人饮用。伊恩坐在体育馆的一角，眼前放着一盘炸鸡肉丸和特地带来的一塑料杯抗感冒药粉。他揉着鼻翼。微笑着耐心等候。此刻的爱玛沉浸在赞美声中。“足可以到西区上演了！”有人不无夸张地说道。教唆犯费金的饰演者罗德尼·钱斯已被洒精软饮料弄得有几分醉意，跑过来对她说：“你很适合干教师这一行。”她听了丝毫不觉被冒犯。戈德尔明先生（“请你叫我菲尔吧”）向她道贺，他的太太菲奥娜板着张农家媳妇般的红扑扑的脸，一副焦躁不悦的模样。“咱们九月份得谈谈，你在这里的发展。”菲尔说着俯身吻她作别，引来一些孩子和员工的侧目、“哇哦”地起哄。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Forty-five minutes later, as the final credits roll, she frowns and tries to make sense of what she has just seen. She doesn't know much about television, but she is pretty sure that Dexter hasn't shone. He has looked shaky, actually frightened sometimes. Fluffing lines, looking at the wrong camera, he has seemed amateurish and inept and as if sensing his unease the people he has interviewed -- the rapper on tour, the four cocky young Mancunians -- have responded with disdain or sarcasm. The studio audience glares too, like surly teenagers at a pantomime, arms crossed high on their chests. For the first time since she met him he appears to be making an effort. Might he be, well, drunk? She doesn't know much about the media, but she can recognise a car crashing. By the time the last band plays out her hand has come to cover her face, and she knows enough about TV to know this is not ideal. There's a lot of irony about these days, but surely not to the extent that booing is good.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="四十五分钟后，演职人员表滚动起来，她皱着眉回味着方才的节目。尽管对电视行业知之甚少，不过她可以肯定，德克斯特没有发挥出实力。他看上去虚弱不安，有时简直流露出恐惧，说错台词，对错镜头—表现得业余而笨拙。采访的对象，四个来自曼彻斯特的盛气凌人的青年说唱歌手，正在巡演途中——似乎感到了他的不安，他们带着轻视和嘲弄应对提问。现场观众也不好伺候，像群桀骜的青少年在看哑剧，一个个抱着手臂。她头一次看到了他奋力挣扎的姿态。他会不会是，哦：喝多了？以她一个外行人的身份都能看出这无异于一场车祸。告别曲奏起来的时候，她单手掩面，感叹这节目的不理想。这年头有些事虽真假难辨，不过嘘声还不至于等同于赞美。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She turns the TV off. From the bathroom comes the sound of Ian honking into a flannel. She closes the door and picks up the phone, moulding her mouth into a congratulatory smile and in an empty flat in Belsize Park the answering machine picks up. "So -- talk to me!" says Dexter, and Emma goes into her act. "Hey you! Hiya! I know you're at the party so just wanted to say, well first of all, thank you for the flowers. So beautiful, Dex, you shouldn't have. But mainly -- Well! Done! You! You were fantastic, just really relaxed and funny, I thought it was fantastic, just a really, really, great, great show, really." She hesitates: don't say "really". If you say "really" too often it sounds like "not-really". She continues. "I'm still not sure about that t-shirt-under-suit-jacket-thing, and it's always refreshing to see women dancing in cages, but Dexter, apart from that, it was just excellent. Really. I'm really so proud of you, Dex. In case you're interested, Oliver! went alright too."</div>

People cross to congratulate him but no-one lingers long and the pats on the shoulder have come to feel like consolation or, at best, well done on missing that penalty. He has continued to drink steadily but the champagne seems stale in his mouth and nothing seems to lift the sense of disappointment, anti-climax, creeping shame.</div>
