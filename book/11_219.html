<div class="line_en">Soon after six o'clock the five hobbits were ready to start. Fatty Bolger was still yawning. They stole quietly out of the house. Merry went in front leading a laden pony, and took his way along a path that went through a spinney behind the house, and then cut across several fields. The leaves of trees were glistening, and every twig was dripping; the grass was grey with cold dew. Everything was still, and far-away noises seemed near and clear: fowls chattering in a yard, someone closing a door of a distant house.</div>

<div class="line_en">Frodo woke suddenly. It was still dark in the room. Merry was standing there with a candle in one hand, and banging on the door with the other. "All right! What is it?" said Frodo, still shaken and bewildered. "What is it!" cried Merry. "It is time to get up. It is half past four and very foggy. Come on! Sam is already getting breakfast ready. Even Pippin is up. I am just going to saddle the ponies, and fetch the one that is to be the baggage-carrier. Wake that sluggard Fatty! At least he must get up and see us off."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Follow me!" said Merry, "and you will see." He turned to the left along the Hedge, and soon they came to a point where it bent inwards, running along the lip of a hollow. A cutting had been made, at some distance from the Hedge, and went sloping gently down into the ground. It had walls of brick at the sides, which rose steadily, until suddenly they arched over and formed a tunnel that dived deep under the Hedge and came out in the hollow on the other side.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“跟我来！”梅里说，“你们就会知道了。”他转过身，沿着高篱往左走，很快就来到一个篱笆沿着一座谷地往内弯的地方。距离高篱不远的地方有条小路蜿蜒的朝着高篱延伸，缓缓往下倾。这条小路两边有着缓缓升高的砖墙，走到一半，两边的砖墙就在小路上会合，底下是一个钻过高篱的隧道，通往另一边的谷地。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In their shed they found the ponies; sturdy little beasts of the kind loved by hobbits, not speedy, but good for a long day's work. They mounted, and soon they were riding off into the mist, which seemed to open reluctantly before them and close forbiddingly behind them. After riding for about an hour, slowly and without talking, they saw the Hedge looming suddenly ahead. It was tall and netted over with silver cobwebs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们到马厩里面牵出小马：这些正是哈比人喜欢的结实马种。它们虽然跑得不快，却耐操劳，适合整天的劳动。一行人骑上马，头也不回的骑进大雾中。浓密的雾气似乎不情愿的在他们面前分开，又迫不及待的在他们身后阖上。在沉默了一小时之后，高篱突然间出现在他们面前。结实的篱笆上挂着挂着许多银色的蜘蛛网。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was dark and damp. At the far end it was closed by a gate of thick-set iron bars. Merry got down and unlocked the gate, and when they had all passed through he pushed it to again. It shut with a clang, and the lock clicked. The sound was ominous.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="隧道里面又黑又湿。另一端则是一扇由厚重铁条所打造的栅门。梅里下了马，打开门锁，当所有人通过之后，他将门一拉，锁喀达一声的扣上了。这声音听起来充满了不祥的感觉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There!" said Merry. "You have left the Shire, and are now outside, and on the edge of the Old Forest."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你们看！”梅里说。“你们离开了夏尔，来到外面的世界了。这里就是老林的边缘。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"If there are no worse things ahead than the Old Forest, I shall be lucky," said Frodo. "Tell Gandalf to hurry along the East Road: we shall soon be back on it and going as fast as we can."</div>

<div class="line_en">"I don't know what stories you mean," Merry answered. "If you mean the old bogey-stories Fatty's nurses used to tell him, about goblins and wolves and things of that sort, I should say no. At any rate I don't believe them. But the Forest is queer. Everything in it is very much more alive, more aware of what is going on, so to speak, than things are in the Shire. And the trees do not like strangers. They watch you. They are usually content merely to watch you, as long as daylight lasts, and don't do much. Occasionally the most unfriendly ones may drop a branch, or stick a root out, or grasp at you with a long trailer. But at night things can be most alarming, or so I am told. I have only once or twice been in here after dark, and then only near the hedge. I thought all the trees were whispering to each other, passing news and plots along in an unintelligible language; and the branches swayed and groped without any wind. They do say the trees do actually move, and can surround strangers and hem them in. In fact long ago they attacked the Hedge: they came and planted themselves right by it, and leaned over it. But the hobbits came and cut down hundreds of trees, and made a great bonfire in the Forest, and burned all the ground in a long strip east of the Hedge. After that the trees gave up the attack, but they became very unfriendly. There is still a wide bare space not far inside where the bonfire was made."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不知道你指的是哪些故事，”梅里回答。“如果你说的是小胖的保母常说的鬼故事，有关什么地精和恶狼之类的传说；那我的答案是否定的。至少我不相信这些鬼故事。但这座森林的确有些古怪。这么说吧，这里的一切事物都彷佛自有主张，对外界的变动更敏感，和夏尔的环境大不相同。这里的树木不喜欢陌生人。它们会注意着你。通常，只要天还是亮着的，它们就只会看着你。偶尔，对动物最有敌意的老树可能会刻意丢下枝干、伸出树根绊人、或是用须根缠住你。但人家告诉我，晚上事情就没这么简单了。如果是以晚上来说，我只有来过这边一两次，而且都不敢离高篱太远。我感觉所有的树木好像都在窃窃私语，用无法辨认的语言交谈着各种陰谋和计划。几乎每一株树的枝丫都鬼气森森的无风自动。我听人说，这些树木真的会移动，而且会把陌生人团团围住。事实上，很久以前它们曾经攻击过高篱。它们将自己根深蒂固的移植到篱笆旁边，以树干的重量压上去。后来，哈比人为了保护家园，砍掉了成百的树木，在老林里面放大火清地，在高篱东边烧出了一条长长的空地来。在那之后，树木就放弃了攻击的行动，变得更不友善。距离那场大火不远的地方至今都是寸草不生。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"There are various queer things living deep in the Forest, and on the far side," said Merry, "or at least I have heard so; but I have never seen any of them. But something makes paths. Whenever one comes inside one finds open tracks; but they seem to shift and change from time to time in a queer fashion. Not far from this tunnel there is, or was for a long time, the beginning of quite a broad path leading to the Bonfire Glade, and then on more or less in our direction, east and a little north. That is the path I am going to try and find."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“在另一边住着很多奇怪的生物，”梅里说，“至少人家是跟我这样说的。不过，我从来没有看过这些家伙。我只能确定，这里有些生物会制造出足迹和兽径。随时随地只要进来这座森林，你都可以找到明显的痕迹。但这些痕迹和兽径似乎会照着奇怪的规律进行变动。离这隧道不远的地方以前有条很宽的大路，通往篝火草原，然后它会再往我们要走的方向延伸，往东，再往北。我要找的就是这条路。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The hobbits now left the tunnel-gate and rode across the wide hollow. On the far side was a faint path leading up on to the floor of the Forest, a hundred yards and more beyond the Hedge; but it vanished as soon as it brought them under the trees. Looking back they could see the dark line of the Hedge through the stems of trees that were already thick about them. Looking ahead they could see only tree-trunks of innumerable sizes and shapes: straight or bent, twisted, leaning, squat or slender, smooth or gnarled and branched; and all the stems were green or grey with moss and slimy, shaggy growths.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一行人离开了隧道口，骑上空旷的谷地。在谷地的对面有条不太明显的小径通往森林中。这条路大概长几百码左右，但一到森林边缘路就消失了。穿过森林中浓密的枝丫往回看，众人还依稀看得见高篱的位置。在他们前方则只剩下各式各样的树干：有直的、有弯的、扭曲的、斜的、瘦的、宽大的、纤细的、光滑或是充满树瘤的。唯一的共通点就是所有的树皮上都长满了黏呼呼的苔藓。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They picked a way among the trees, and their ponies plodded along, carefully avoiding the many writhing and interlacing roots. There was no undergrowth. The ground was rising steadily, and as they went forward it seemed that the trees became taller, darker, and thicker. There was no sound, except an occasional drip of moisture falling through the still leaves. For the moment there was no whispering or movement among the branches; but they all got an uncomfortable feeling that they were being watched with disapproval, deepening to dislike and even enmity. The feeling steadily grew, until they found themselves looking up quickly, or glancing back over their shoulders, as if they expected a sudden blow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们骑着马在树林中穿梭，小心的躲开地面交错的树根。地上寸草不生，地势也变得越来越高。随着他们越来越深入林中，树木看来也变得更黑暗、更高耸、更密集。除了树叶上凝结水气滴下的声音外，整座森林没有任何其它的动静。暂时，这些树木还不会窃窃私语、轻举妄动；但是，所有人都有种不安的感觉，彷佛正被人以敌视的眼光监视着。这种让人毛骨悚然的感觉不断滋长，不久之后，每个人都开始疑神疑鬼的四下打量，彷佛担心会遭到神秘力量的攻击。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The light grew clearer as they went forward. Suddenly they came out of the trees and found themselves in a wide circular space. There was sky above them, blue and clear to their surprise, for down under the Forest-roof they had not been able to see the rising morning and the lifting of the mist. The sun was not, however, high enough yet to shine down into the clearing, though its light was on the tree-tops. The leaves were all thicker and greener about the edges of the glade, enclosing it with an almost solid wall. No tree grew there, only rough grass and many tall plants: stalky and faded hemlocks and wood-parsley, fire-weed seeding into fluffy ashes, and rampant nettles and thistles. A dreary place: but it seemed a charming and cheerful garden after the close Forest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随着他们朝着草原前进的脚步，附近的天色变得越来越亮。他们接着走出了树林的包围，来到了一块圆形的空旷草地上。他们抬头一看，惊讶的发现天空竟然是清澄的蓝色。因为，原先他们在森林的茂密植物阻挡之下，连大雾的消失和升起的太陽都无法得见。不过，太陽这时还没有高到足以越过四周的植物，照进这块空地中。在靠近这块草地周围的地方，树叶显得额外茂密和集中，似乎想要滴水不露的阻隔这块土地。这块空地上几乎都是低矮的杂草和一些较高的野生植物，包括了：茎叶特别发达的毒胡萝卜、木茎的西洋芹，在散布四处的灰烬中茂密生长的火迹地杂草、猖獗的荨麻和蓟类植物。这地方看来确曾饱经劫火，但和四周的森林比较起来，却成了一座让人轻松许多的美丽花园。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The hobbits felt encouraged, and looked up hopefully at the broadening daylight in the sky. At the far side of the glade there was a break in the wall of trees, and a clear path beyond it. They could see it running on into the wood, wide in places and open above, though every now and again the trees drew in and overshadowed it with their dark boughs. Up this path they rode. They were still climbing gently, but they now went much quicker, and with better heart; for it seemed to them that the Forest had relented, and was going to let them pass unhindered after all.</div>

<div class="line_en">But after a while the air began to get hot and stuffy. The trees drew close again on either side, and they could no longer see far ahead. Now stronger than ever they felt again the ill will of the wood pressing on them. So silent was it that the fall of their ponies' hoofs, rustling on dead leaves and occasionally stumbling on hidden roots, seemed to thud in their ears. Frodo tried to sing a song to encourage them, but his voice sank to a murmur.</div>

A heavy weight was settling steadily on Frodo's heart, and he regretted now with every step forward that he had ever thought of challenging the menace of the trees. He was, indeed, just about to stop and propose going back (if that was still possible), when things took a new turn. The path stopped climbing, and became for a while nearly level. The dark trees drew aside, and ahead they could see the path going almost straight forward.

<div class="line_en">The hobbits led their ponies up, winding round and round until they reached the top. There they stood and gazed about them. The air was gleaming and sunlit, but hazy; and they could not see to any great distance. Near at hand the mist was now almost gone; though here and there it lay in hollows of the wood, and to the south of them, out of a deep fold cutting right across the Forest, the fog still rose like steam or wisps of white smoke.</div>

<div class="line_en">They now hurried forward again, delighted with the thought of climbing out for a while above the roof of the Forest. The path dipped, and then again began to climb upwards, leading them at last to the foot of the steep hillside. There it left the trees and faded into the turf. The wood stood all round the hill like thick hair that ended sharply in a circle round a shaven crown.</div>

<div class="line_en">The sun on the hill-top was now getting hot. It must have been about eleven o'clock; but the autumn haze still prevented them from seeing much in other directions. In the west they could not make out either the line of the Hedge or the valley of the Brandywine beyond it. Northward, where they looked most hopefully, they could see nothing that might be the line of the great East Road, for which they were making. They were on an island in a sea of trees, and the horizon was veiled.</div>

<div class="line_en">On the south-eastern side the ground fell very steeply, as if the slopes of the hill were continued far down under the trees, like island-shores that really are the sides of a mountain rising out of deep waters. They sat on the green edge and looked out over the woods below them, while they ate their mid-day meal. As the sun rose and passed noon they glimpsed far off in the east the grey-green lines of the Downs that lay beyond the Old Forest on that side. That cheered them greatly; for it was good to see a sight of anything beyond the wood's borders, though they did not mean to go that way, if they could help it: the Barrow-downs had as sinister a reputation in hobbit-legend as the Forest itself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="东南方的地势则是十分陡峭，山坡似乎一直延续到浓密的森林中；这真的就像从海中升起的海岸一样。他们就这样坐在坡上，俯瞰着这一片绿色的密林，吃起了午餐。等到太陽越过了天顶之后，他们终于可以看见东方老林边缘外的山丘轮廓。这让他们大为振奋，能看见森林边境之外任何的事物都是好的；不过，如果有别的选择，他们是不会往那个方向靠近的。古墓岗在哈比人的传说中是个比森林更邪恶的地方。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At first their choice seemed to be good: they got along at a fair speed, though whenever they got a glimpse of the sun in an open glade they seemed unaccountably to have veered eastwards. But after a time the trees began to close in again, just where they had appeared from a distance to be thinner and less tangled. Then deep folds in the ground were discovered unexpectedly, like the ruts of great giant-wheels or wide moats and sunken roads long disused and choked with brambles. These lay usually right across their line of march, and could only be crossed by scrambling down and out again, which was troublesome and difficult with their ponies. Each time they climbed down they found the hollow filled with thick bushes and matted undergrowth, which somehow would not yield to the left, but only gave way when they turned to the right; and they had to go some distance along the bottom before they could find a way up the further bank. Each time they clambered out, the trees seemed deeper and darker; and always to the left and upwards it was most difficult to find a way, and they were forced to the right and downwards.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一开始这决定似乎非常正确：众人前进的速度很不错，唯一让人有些担心的问题是每当他们看到太陽的方位时，都会有种道路持续往东方偏的感觉。不过，不久之后，树木却又开始合拢起来。怪异的是，这正是从远处看来树林开始变得稀疏的同一个位置。道路上更开始出现了一道又一道的深沟，彷佛是被巨大车轮碾过的痕迹一样，在这些深沟中还长满了大量的荆棘。而这些深沟每每都是毫不留情的切过他们所走的道路，导致每次一行人都必须牵着马匹狼狈的走下，再艰辛的爬出。小马们非常不适应这样的跋涉和地形。每当他们好不容易下到深沟中时，眼前都一定会是浓密的矮灌木和纠结的野生植物。不知道为什么，如果他们往左边走，所有的植物就会纠缠在一起，让他们无法通过；只有当他们往右边走的时候，这些植物才会让步。往往他们还必须在深沟中跋涉相当的距离之后才能够找到路爬上对岸去。每一次他们爬出深沟之后，眼前的树木就显得更为蓊郁、更为幽暗；只要一往左、往上坡走，眼前的路就会显得难以通过。最后，他们只得照着这股莫名的意志不停的往右、往下坡走。大概过了一两个小时之后，他们完全失去了方向感，只知道从很久以前一行人就已经偏离了北方的方向。他们只能够照着一条安排好的道路向东南前进；而这是由外来的意志替他们决定好的。他们只能别无选择的朝着森林的中心而去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At length they made up their minds to go on again. The path that had brought them to the hill reappeared on the northward side; but they had not followed it far before they became aware that it was bending steadily to the right. Soon it began to descend rapidly and they guessed that it must actually be heading towards the Withywindle valley: not at all the direction they wished lo take. After some discussion they decided to leave this misleading path and strike northward; for although they had not been able to see it from the hill-top, the Road must lie that way, and it could not be many miles off. Also northward, and to the left of the path, the land seemed lo be drier and more open, climbing up to slopes where the trees were thinner, and pines and firs replaced the oaks and ashes and other strange and nameless trees of the denser wood.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不久之后，他们终于下定决心继续前进。带着他们来到这座小丘的道路又再度出现在山的北边。不过，他们没走多久就发现这条路一直往右偏，很明显的是通往柳条河谷：这可不是他们想要去的地方。经过一段讨论之后，他们决定离开这条路，直接往北边走：因为他们虽然在山丘上看不见东方大道，但它一定就在那个方向，距离也不应该太远才对。除此之外，北边看起来也比较干燥、比较开阔，山坡上的树木似乎也少一点；在那边松树和柏树取代了这里的橡树和白杨木，看来让人安心许多。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The afternoon was wearing away when they scrambled and stumbled into a fold that was wider and deeper than any they had yet met. It was so sleep and overhung that it proved impossible to climb out of it again, either forwards or backwards, without leaving their ponies and their baggage behind. All they could do was to follow the fold -- downwards. The ground grew soft, and in places boggy; springs appeared in the banks, and soon they found themselves following a brook that trickled and babbled through a weedy bed. Then the ground began to fall rapidly, and the brook growing strong and noisy, flowed and leaped swiftly downhill. They were in a deep dim-lit gully over-arched by trees high above them.</div>

Coming to the opening they found that they had made their way down through a cleft in a high sleep bank, almost a cliff. At its feet was a wide space of grass and reeds; and in the distance could be glimpsed another bank almost as steep. A golden afternoon of late sunshine lay warm and drowsy upon the hidden land between. In the midst of it there wound lazily a dark river of brown water, bordered with ancient willows, arched over with willows, blocked with fallen willows, and flecked with thousands of faded willow-leaves. The air was thick with them, fluttering yellow from the branches; for there was a warm and gentle breeze blowing softly in the valley, and the reeds were rustling, and the willow-boughs were creaking.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Put it out! Put it out!" begged Merry. The branches of the willow began to sway violently. There was a sound as of a wind rising and spreading outwards to the branches of all the other trees round about, as though they had dropped a stone into the quiet slumber of the river-valley and set up ripples of anger that ran out over the whole Forest. Sam kicked at the little fire and stamped out the sparks. But Frodo, without any clear idea of why he did so, or what he hoped for, ran along the path crying help! help! help! It seemed to him that he could hardly hear the sound of his own shrill voice: it was blown away from him by the willow-wind and drowned in a clamour of leaves, as soon as the words left his mouth. He felt desperate: lost and witless.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“快灭火！快灭火！”梅里哀求道。柳树的枝丫开始不停的晃动。四周的树木突然间纷纷开始颤动，彷佛有阵愤怒的微风从老柳树为中心往外扩散，让整座森林都陷入了暴怒之中。山姆立刻踢散了柴火，踏熄了火焰。佛罗多慌乱中下意识的沿着小径狂奔，大喊着“救命！救命！救命！”连他自己都听不太清楚这呼救的声音，柳树枝叶所掀起的狂怒之风几乎将它完全掩盖住了。他觉得走投无路，感到无比绝望。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Suddenly he slopped. There was an answer, or so he thought; but it seemed to come from behind him, away down the path further back in the Forest.

<div class="line_en">Frodo and Sam stood as if enchanted. The wind puffed out. The leaves hung silently again on stiff branches. There was another burst of song, and then suddenly, hopping and dancing along the path, there appeared above the reeds an old battered hat with a tall crown and a long blue feather stuck in the band. With another hop and a bound there came into view a man, or so it seemed. At any rate he was too large and heavy for a hobbit, if not quite tall enough for one of the Big People, though he made noise enough for one, slumping along with great yellow boots on his thick legs, and charging through grass and rushes like a cow going down to drink. He had a blue coat and a long brown beard; his eyes were blue and bright, and his face was red as a ripe apple, but creased into a hundred wrinkles of laughter. In his hands he carried on a large leaf as on a tray a small pile of white water-lilies.</div>

<div class="line_en">Setting down his lilies carefully on the grass, he ran to the tree. There he saw Merry's feet still sticking out -- the rest had already been drawn further inside.

Tom sprang away, and breaking off a hanging branch smote the side of the willow with it. "You let them out again, Old Man Willow!" he said. "What be you a-thinking of? You should not be waking. Eat earth! Dig deep! Drink water! Go to sleep! Bombadil is talking!" He then seized Merry's feet and drew him out of the suddenly widening crack.</div>

Great shadows fell across them; trunks and branches of trees hung dark and threatening over the path.

They began to feel that all this country was unreal, and that they were stumbling through an ominous dream that led to no awakening.</div>

The path was now plain before them, well-tended and bordered with stone. It wound up on to the top of a grassy knoll, now grey under the pale starry night; and there, still high above them on a further slope, they saw the twinkling lights of a house. Down again the path went, and then up again, up a long smooth hillside of turf, towards the light. Suddenly a wide yellow beam flowed out brightly from a door that was opened. There was Tom Bombadil's house before them, up, down, under hill. Behind it a steep shoulder of the land lay grey and bare, and beyond that the dark shapes of the Barrow-downs stalked away into the eastern night.</div>

They stepped out from the Forest, and found a wide sweep of grass welling up before them. The river, now small and swift, was leaping merrily down to meet them, glinting here and there in the light of the stars, which were already shining in the sky.</div>
