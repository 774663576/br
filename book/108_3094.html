<div class="line_en">She believed in destiny. That all the roads you walk in life, in one way or another, "lead to what has been predetermined for you." Ove, of course, just started muttering under his breath and got very busy fiddling about with a screw or something whenever she started going on like this. But he never disagreed with her. Maybe to her destiny was "something"; that was none of his business. But to him, destiny was "someone."</div>

<div class="line_en">Ove, conscientious and dutiful, completed his two-week stint on the railways. And to his own surprise he found that he liked it. There was a certain liberation in doing a job. Grabbing hold of things with his own two hands and seeing the fruit of his efforts. Ove hadn't ever disliked school, but he hadn't quite seen the point of it either. He liked mathematics, and was two academic years ahead of his classmates. As for the other subjects, quite honestly he was not so concerned about them.</div>

<div class="line_en">When he clocked off from his last shift on the last day he was downcast. Not only because he had to go back to school, but because it had only occurred to him now that he didn't know how to earn a living. Dad had been good in many ways, of course, but Ove had to admit he hadn't left much of an estate except a run-down house, an old Saab, and a dented wristwatch. Alms from the church were out of the question, God should be bloody clear about that. Ove said as much to himself while he stood there in the changing rooms, maybe as much for his own benefit as God's.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到最后一天下班的时候，他才开始陷入悲伤。并不只是因为他必须回学校，还因为这是他第一次意识到，从今往后，他不知道该怎么养活自己。父亲怎么说都是个好人，但除了一套破旧不堪的房子、一辆老爷萨博车和一块变形的腕表之外，什么都没留下。教会的捐助就不用再提了，上帝应该他妈的心里有数。欧维一个人站在更衣室里的时候这么说出了声，可能更多的是对他自己而非上帝说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then he packed up his stuff and left. Whether God or anyone else was listening he never found out. But when Ove came out of the changing rooms, a man from the managing director's office was standing there waiting for him.</div>

<div class="line_en">And that's how he ended up in his father's old boots. He worked hard, never complained, and was never ill. The old boys on his shift found him a little on the quiet side and a little odd on top of that. He never wanted to join them for a beer after work and he seemed uninterested in women as well, which was more than weird in its own right. But he was a chip off the old block and had never given them anything to complain about. If anyone asked Ove for a hand, he got on with it; if anyone asked him to cover a shift for them, he did it without any fuss. As time went by, more or less all of them owed him a favor or two. So they accepted him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后他就自然而然地接了父亲的班。他工作努力，从不抱怨，从不生病。班上的那些老家伙们可能会觉得他沉默寡言，有时甚至有些孤僻，下班后他不跟他们一起去喝啤酒，而且他好像对女人也完全不感兴趣，这本身就够古怪的。但他是他父亲的小家伙，从来没人和他父亲拌过嘴。谁让搭把手他就搭把手，谁让顶个班他就顶个班，毫无怨言。慢慢地，几乎班上的所有人都欠他一两个人情，所以他们接纳了他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When the old truck, the one they used to drive up and down the railway track, broke down one night more than ten miles outside of town, in one of the worst downpours of the whole year, Ove managed to repair it with nothing but a screwdriver and half a roll of gauze tape. After that, as far as the old boys on the tracks were concerned, Ove was okay.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那年最恶劣的暴风雨夜，他们那辆沿铁轨来来回回的老爷卡车在离城市两英里的地方抛了锚，欧维仅凭一把螺丝刀和半卷胶带就把它修好了。从此以后，只要是铁道上的那些老家伙都会说，欧维这孩子不错。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He had no friends. But on the other hand he hardly had any enemies either, apart from Tom, who since his promotion to foreman took every opportunity to make Ove's life as difficult as possible. He gave him the dirtiest and heaviest jobs, shouted at him, tripped him up at breakfast, sent him under railway carriages for inspections and set them in motion while Ove lay unprotected on the cross ties. When Ove, startled, threw himself out of the way just in time, Tom laughed contemptuously and roared: "Look out or you'll end up like your old man!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他没有朋友，但换句话说，也没有什么直接的敌人。反正没有比汤姆更糟糕的敌人，如今已经升做工头的汤姆总是一有机会就给欧维找碴。他给欧维最脏最累的活，没事就冲他吼，领早饭的时候拿脚绊他，派他钻到车厢底下，然后在毫无保护措施的情况下发动列车。当欧维惊恐地闪开的时候，汤姆就大声地责难：“小心着点，不然就跟你爸爸一样！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the evenings he'd boil his sausages and potatoes, staring out the kitchen window as he ate. And the next morning he'd go to work again. He liked the routine, liked always knowing what to expect. Since his father's death he had begun more and more to differentiate between people who did what they should, and those who didn't. People who did and people who just talked. Ove talked less and less and did more and more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="晚上欧维烧香肠和土豆，坐在厨房操作台前透过玻璃窗向外张望，盛出晚餐。最后他站起身，端着盘子出门，坐到萨博里吃。第二天他继续出门上班。这成了他的生活。他喜欢规律，喜欢总是有盼头的感觉。父亲死后，他渐渐开始把安分守己的人和不这么做的人区分开，把做事的人和干说不练的人区分开，所以欧维少言寡语却勤奋努力。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ove kept his head down, though, and his mouth shut. He saw no purpose in challenging a man who was twice his own size. He went to work every day and did justice to himself -- that had been good enough for his father and so it would also have to do for Ove. His colleagues learned to appreciate him for it. "When people don't talk so much they don't dish out the crap either," one of his older workmates said to him one afternoon down on the track. And Ove nodded. Some got it and some didn't.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维只是低下头闭上嘴，他觉得没有必要和比自己大一倍的人正面冲突。他每天上班洁身自好，父亲能做到，所以他也可以，欧维想。其他同事也开始学着欣赏他这一点。“话少挺好，祸从口出嘛。”某个午后，一个老同事在铁道边对他说。欧维点点头。有人理解，但也有人不理解。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was almost two years after his father's funeral. Ove had just turned eighteen. Tom had been caught out stealing money from the cash box in one of the carriages. Admittedly no one but Ove saw him take it, but Tom and Ove had been the only two people in the carriage when the money went missing. And, as a serious man from the director's office explained when Tom and Ove were ordered to present themselves, no one could believe Ove was the guilty party. And he wasn't, of course.</div>

<div class="line_en">He had plenty of time to think his life over as he walked one last time to the office, a bundle of work clothes clutched in his arms. He had liked working here. Proper tasks, proper tools, a real job. He decided that once the police had gone through the motions of whatever they did with thieves in this situation, he'd try to go somewhere where he could get himself another job like this one. He might have to travel far, he imagined. Most likely a criminal record needed a reasonable geographical distance before it started to pale and become uninteresting.

<div class="line_en">He had to sit on the wooden chair in the corridor for almost forty minutes before a middle-aged woman in a tight-fitting black skirt and pointy glasses came and told him he could come into the office. She closed the door behind him. He stood there, still with his work clothes in his arms. The director sat behind his desk with his hands clasped together in front of him. The two men submitted one another to such a long examination that either of them could have been an unusually interesting painting in a museum.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他在走廊的靠背椅上坐了将近四十分钟，直到一个穿紧身黑裙戴尖框眼镜的老女人对他说，他可以进办公室了。她在他背后关上门。他孤零零地站在房间中央，工作服还揣在怀里。总经理坐在办公桌后，双手握在眼前。他们彼此注视了很久，就像彼此都是博物馆墙上一幅有趣的油画。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It was Tom who took that money," said the director.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是汤姆拿的钱。”总经理说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He did not say it as a question, just a short confirming statement. Ove didn't answer. The director nodded.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的语气不是在提问，只是简短的陈述。欧维没有回答。总经理点点头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That was not a question either. And Ove didn't reply.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这也不是在提问。欧维还是没有回答。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The director nodded again. Put on a pair of glasses, looked through a pile of papers, and started writing something. As if in that very moment Ove had disappeared from the room. Ove stood in front of him for so long that he quite seriously began to doubt whether the director was aware of his presence. The director looked up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="总经理再次点点头，戴上眼镜，低头看看一厚摞纸，然后开始在其中一张上写字。就像欧维从房间里消失了一般。欧维久久地站在他面前，以至于他真开始怀疑总经理没有意识到他的存在。最后他轻轻咳嗽了一声。总经理抬起头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The director looked at him with surprise. It was the longest sequence of words anyone at the railway depot had heard the boy say since he started working there two years ago. In all honesty, Ove did not know where they came from. He just felt they had to be said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="总经理惊讶地看着他。自从这个男孩在铁道上工作两年来，这儿还没人听见过他一口气说这么一长串话。说老实话，欧维也不知道这些话是从哪儿冒出来的。他只是觉得应该说出来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="总经理再次低下头面对那摞纸，在其中一张纸上又写了几笔，递到桌前，指着某处让欧维签字。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ove turned around. Went into the corridor. Closed the door behind him. Felt light-headed. Just as he reached the front door the woman who had first let him in caught up with energetic steps, and before he had time to protest she pressed a paper into his hands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维转过身，关上身后的门，走到过道上，感到一阵晕眩。正当他要走出大门的时候，那个领他进去的女人快步追了上来，还没等他反应过来就往他手里塞了一张纸。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The director asked me to pass on another message: You did not take that wallet when you were nine years old. And he'll be deuced if you took anything now. And it would be a damned pity for him to be responsible for kicking a decent man's son into the street just because the son has some principles."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“总经理还说，你九岁那年没有拿那个钱包，现在他也不相信你会偷任何东西。让他把一个正人君子的孩子送到大街上就因为那孩子也是个正人君子，这简直就是造孽。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And so it turned out that Ove became a night cleaner instead. And if this hadn't happened, he would never have come off his shift that morning and caught sight of her. With those red shoes and the gold brooch and all her burnished brown hair. And that laughter of hers, which, for the rest of his life, would make him feel as if someone was running around barefoot on the inside of his breast.</div>
