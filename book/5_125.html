<div class="line_en">For the next week Kate soaked in the early summer sun; her days were spent huddled under her treasured afghans in a chair by the beach, writing furiously in her journal, or talking with her kids or her husband or Tully. Evenings were taken up by conversation; Lucas and William told the longest, most run-on stories in the world. By the end of them, everyone was laughing. Afterward, the adults sat around the fire. More and more often they talked about the old days, back when they'd been too young to know that they were young, when the whole world had seemed open to them and dreams were as easy to pick as daisies. The funniest part of all was watching Tully try to take over the household duties. She burned dinners, bitched about an island world where no one delivered food to your home, ruined laundry, and repeatedly received instructions about how to operate the vacuum. Kate especially loved it when she heard her friend mutter, "This at-home shit is hard. Why didn't you ever tell me? No wonder you looked tired for fifteen years."</div>

<div class="line_en">But no matter how hard they all tried to be normal, their life was a dirty window that couldn't be wiped clean. Everything, every moment, was coated by illness. As always, it fell to Kate to lead the way, to be the smiling, optimistic one. They were all okay as long as she remained strong and resilient. Then they could talk and laugh and carry on the pretense of ordinary life.</div>

<div class="line_en">And then there was the pain. By late July, when the nights began to grow longer and had the sweet sultry taste of a ripe peach, she had nearly doubled her morphine dosage and no one cared. As her doctor said, "Addiction isn't your problem now."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此外还有疼痛。到了七月下旬，当夜晚越来越长，空气中弥漫着过熟桃子般甜腻闷热的气味，她的吗啡用量已经增加将近一倍，完全没有人制止她。正如医生所说：“比起你身体的状况，药瘾只是小问题。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As the weeks passed, Kate felt herself weakening. Despite her best efforts and her purposely optimistic attitude, her body began to fail in a dozen little ways. A word she couldn't find, a sentence she couldn't finish, a trembling weakness in her fingers that wouldn't still, a nausea that all too often became unbearable, and the cold. She was always chilled to the bone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一周周过去，凯蒂感觉自己越来越衰弱。尽管她努力硬撑，并刻意保持乐观的态度，但她的身体有许多小地方开始失能。她会想不起字词，无法说完一个句子，手指虚弱抖个不停，恶心反胃的感觉经常强烈到无法忍受，而且很冷，她经常觉得冷到骨子里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She was a good enough actress that no one seemed to notice how weak she was becoming. Oh, they knew she had to use the wheelchair to get to the beach, and that she often fell asleep well before the nightly movie started, but in these days of summer, the household was in a constant state of flux. Tully had taken over Kate's daytime routine as best she could, which left Kate time to work on her journal. Sometimes, lately, she worried that she wouldn't have time to finish it, and the thought scared her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的演技很不错，所以没人察觉她变得多么虚弱。噢，他们知道她必须坐轮椅才能去海滩，往往晚上的影片还没播放她就睡着了，而在夏季的日子里，这个家经常处于变动状态。塔莉尽可能接手凯蒂白天的杂务，于是凯蒂有很多时间可以写回忆录，最近她开始担心可能来不及写完，这个想法让她很害怕。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"And I figured out why. We all need it." She reached over to the end table and picked up the paperback copy of The Hobbit Kate had given her. It felt like a lifetime ago now, the day she'd given this favorite novel to her daughter, passed it on. A lifetime ago, and an instant.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“后来我想通原因了，我们大家都需要这本书。”她伸手从沙发旁的小茶几上拿起《霍比特人》，就是凯蒂从前送她的那一本。感觉像是无比久远以前的事了，她将自己最喜欢的小说传承给女儿，既像是上辈子，也像是上一秒。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Marah took her by the arm and steadied her, becoming for a moment the mother; she led her into the living room, where, despite the heat of the day, a fire burned in the fireplace. Lucas and William, still in their jammies, sat together on the couch.</div>

<div class="line_en">After he left, the house behind her settled into an unfamiliar silence. She stared out at the glittering blue Sound and the tiara of a city on the opposite shore, remembering suddenly when she'd lived over there, near the Public Market; a young career girl with shoulder pads and cinch belts and slouch boots. That was when she first saw Johnny and tumbled into love. She still remembered so many of their moments -- when he'd first kissed her and called her Katie and said he didn't want to hurt her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他出门后，身后的屋子陷入陌生的寂静。她望着波光潋滟的碧蓝海湾，以及对岸城市如王冠般的天际线，忽然想起当年住在那里的往事。帕克市场附近的公寓，她是个穿着垫肩上衣、腰封和抓皱皮靴的年轻上班族；她对强尼一见钟情，她依然记得他们之间许多重要的时刻，第一次接吻后他唤她的名字，然后说不想伤害她。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That's the funny thing about writing your life story. You start out trying to remember dates and times and names. You think it's about facts, your life; that what you'll look back on and remember are the successes and failures, the time line of your youth and middle age, but that isn't it at all.</div>

<div class="line_en">Love. Family. Laughter. That's what I remember when it's all said and done. For so much of my life I thought I didn't do enough or want enough. I guess I can be forgiven my stupidity. I was young. I want my children to know how proud I am of them, and how proud I am of me. We were everything we needed -- you and Daddy and I. I had everything I ever wanted.</div>
