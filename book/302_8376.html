<div class="line_en">As Elinor and Marianne were walking together the next morning the latter communicated a piece of news to her sister, which in spite of all that she knew before of Marianne's imprudence and want of thought, surprised her by its extravagant testimony of both. Marianne told her, with the greatest delight, that Willoughby had given her a horse, one that he had bred himself on his estate in Somersetshire, and which was exactly calculated to carry a woman. Without considering that it was not in her mother's plan to keep any horse, that if she were to alter her resolution in favour of this gift, she must buy another for the servant, and keep a servant to ride it, and after all, build a stable to receive them, she had accepted the present without hesitation, and told her sister of it in raptures.</div>

<div class="line_en">"You are mistaken, Elinor," said she warmly, "in supposing I know very little of Willoughby. I have not known him long indeed, but I am much better acquainted with him, than I am with any other creature in the world, except yourself and mama. It is not time or opportunity that is to determine intimacy; -- it is disposition alone. Seven years would be insufficient to make some people acquainted with each other, and seven days are more than enough for others. I should hold myself guilty of greater impropriety in accepting a horse from my brother, than from Willoughby. Of John I know very little, though we have lived together for years; but of Willoughby my judgment has long been formed."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你想错了，埃丽诺，”她激动地说道，“你认为我不很了解威洛比。的确，我认识他时间不长人们认识的逐步深入或提高的阶段。这是黑格尔哲学史观的，可是天下人除了你和妈妈之外，我最了解的就是他了。熟悉不熟悉，不取决于时间和机缘，而只取决于性情。对某些人来说，七年也达不到相互了解，而对另些人来说，七天就绰绰有余了。我倘若接受的是我哥哥的马，而不是威洛比的马，我会觉得更不恰当，那才问心有愧呢。我对约翰很不了解，虽然我们在一起生活了许多年；但对威洛比，我早就有了定见。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Most unwilling was she to awaken from such a dream of felicity to comprehend all the unhappy truths which attended the affair; and for some time she refused to submit to them. As to an additional servant, the expense would be a trifle; Mama she was sure would never object to it; and any horse would do for HIM; he might always get one at the park; as to a stable, the merest shed would be sufficient. Elinor then ventured to doubt the propriety of her receiving such a present from a man so little, or at least so lately known to her. This was too much.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她很不愿意从这幸福的迷梦中惊醒，更不愿意去领悟这桩事所包含的不幸现实。有好长时间，她拒不承认这些现实。再雇一个佣人，那花不了几个钱，她相信母亲决不会反对。佣人骑什么马都可以，随时都可以到巴顿庄园去牵。至于马厩，只要有个棚子就行。随后埃丽诺大胆地表示，从一个自己并不了解、或者至少是最近才了解的男人那里接受礼物，她怀疑是否恰当。这话可叫玛丽安受不了啦。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Elinor thought it wisest to touch that point no more. She knew her sister's temper. Opposition on so tender a subject would only attach her the more to her own opinion. But by an appeal to her affection for her mother, by representing the inconveniences which that indulgent mother must draw on herself, if (as would probably be the case) she consented to this increase of establishment, Marianne was shortly subdued; and she promised not to tempt her mother to such imprudent kindness by mentioning the offer, and to tell Willoughby when she saw him next, that it must be declined.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃丽诺觉得，最好别再触及那个话题。她知道她妹妹的脾气。在如此敏感的一个问题上与她针锋相对，只会使她更加固执己见。于是，她便转而设法激起她的母女之请，向她摆明：母亲是很溺爱子女的，倘使她同意增加这份家产（这是很可能的），那一定会给她招来诸多不便。这么一讲，玛丽安当即软了下来。她答应不向母亲提起送礼的事，以免惹得她好心好意地贸然应允。她还答应下次见到威洛比时告诉他，不能收他的礼物了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She was faithful to her word; and when Willoughby called at the cottage, the same day, Elinor heard her express her disappointment to him in a low voice, on being obliged to forego the acceptance of his present. The reasons for this alteration were at the same time related, and they were such as to make further entreaty on his side impossible. His concern however was very apparent; and after expressing it with earnestness, he added, in the same low voice, --"But, Marianne, the horse is still yours, though you cannot use it now. I shall keep it only till you can claim it. When you leave Barton to form your own establishment in a more lasting home, Queen Mab shall receive you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽安信守诺言，威洛比当天来访时，埃丽诺听她低声向他表示：她很失望，不得不拒绝接受他的礼物。她同时申述了她之所以改变主意的缘由，说得他不好再作恳求。但是威洛比显然十分关切，并且一本正经地做了表白，然后以同样低微的声音接着说道：“不过，玛丽安，这马虽然你现在不能使用，却仍然归你所有。我先保养着，直至你领走为止。等你离开巴顿去建立自己的家庭时，‘麦布皇后’会来接你的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This was all overheard by Miss Dashwood; and in the whole of the sentence, in his manner of pronouncing it, and in his addressing her sister by her Christian name alone, she instantly saw an intimacy so decided, a meaning so direct, as marked a perfect agreement between them. From that moment she doubted not of their being engaged to each other; and the belief of it created no other surprise than that she, or any of their friends, should be left by tempers so frank, to discover it by accident.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一席活都被达什伍德小姐无意中听到了。她从威洛比的整个说话内容，从他说话时的那副神气，从他直称她妹妹的教名，当即发现他们两人如此亲密，如此直率的危害性。提出历史唯物主义和辩证唯物主义是“一整块钢，真可谓情投意合极了。从此刻起，她不再怀疑他们之间已经许定终身。唯一使她感到意外的是，他们两人性情如此坦率，她（或他们的朋友）竟因此而受骗，以至于在无意中她才发现这一秘密。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Margaret related something to her the next day, which placed this matter in a still clearer light. Willoughby had spent the preceding evening with them, and Margaret, by being left some time in the parlour with only him and Marianne, had had opportunity for observations, which, with a most important face, she communicated to her eldest sister, when they were next by themselves.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“自从他们在高派教会丘地邂逅以来，”埃丽诺答道，“你几乎天天都这么说。我想他们认识还不到一个星期，你就一口咬定玛丽安脖子上挂着他的相片，谁想那原来是伯祖父的微型画像。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Margaret's sagacity was not always displayed in a way so satisfactory to her sister. When Mrs. Jennings attacked her one evening at the park, to give the name of the young man who was Elinor's particular favourite, which had been long a matter of great curiosity to her, Margaret answered by looking at her sister, and saying, "I must not tell, may I, Elinor?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛格丽特并非总是显得十分机灵，有时难免引起姐姐的不快。一天晚上，詹宁斯太太在巴顿庄园硬逼着她说出谁是埃丽诺的意中人（长久以来，她一直对此兴致勃勃），玛格丽特瞅了瞅姐姐，然后回答说：“我不能说，是吧，埃丽诺？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"But, indeed, Elinor, it is Marianne's. I am almost sure it is, for I saw him cut it off. Last night after tea, when you and mama went out of the room, they were whispering and talking together as fast as could be, and he seemed to be begging something of her, and presently he took up her scissors and cut off a long lock of her hair, for it was all tumbled down her back; and he kissed it, and folded it up in a piece of white paper; and put it into his pocket-book."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“埃丽诺，那的确是玛丽安的头发。我几乎可以肯定，因为我亲眼见他剪下来的。昨晚用过茶，你和妈妈都走出了房间，他们在窃窃私语，说起话来要多快有多快。威洛比像是在向玛丽安央求什么东西，随即只见他拿起姐姐的剪刀，剪下她一长绺头发，因为她的头发都散落在背后。他把头发亲了亲，然后卷起来包在一张白纸里，装进他的皮夹。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A party was formed this evening for going on the following day to see a very fine place about twelve miles from Barton, belonging to a brother-in-law of Colonel Brandon, without whose interest it could not be seen, as the proprietor, who was then abroad, had left strict orders on that head. The grounds were declared to be highly beautiful, and Sir John, who was particularly warm in their praise, might be allowed to be a tolerable judge, for he had formed parties to visit them, at least, twice every summer for the last ten years. They contained a noble piece of water; a sail on which was to a form a great part of the morning's amusement; cold provisions were to be taken, open carriages only to be employed, and every thing conducted in the usual style of a complete party of pleasure.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当晚，大家组成一个观光团，准备第二天去参观一个景色十分优美的地方。此地离巴顿约有十二英里，归布兰登上校的姐夫所有，若是上校没有兴致，别人谁也别想去随意游览，因为主人当时出门在外，对此曾有言在先，十分严格，据说，这地方美极了，约翰爵士大为赞赏。近十年来，爵士每年夏天至少要组织两次游览，因而可以说是很有发言权。这里小湖风光旖旎，上午主要用来乘船游览。大家带上冷餐，乘上敞篷马车，一切都按观光团的通常规格行事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Most grateful did Elinor feel to Lady Middleton for observing, at this moment, "that it rained very hard," though she believed the interruption to proceed less from any attention to her, than from her ladyship's great dislike of all such inelegant subjects of raillery as delighted her husband and mother. The idea however started by her, was immediately pursued by Colonel Brandon, who was on every occasion mindful of the feelings of others; and much was said on the subject of rain by both of them. Willoughby opened the piano-forte, and asked Marianne to sit down to it; and thus amidst the various endeavours of different people to quit the topic, it fell to the ground. But not so easily did Elinor recover from the alarm into which it had thrown her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="使埃丽诺感激不尽的是，恰在这时，米德尔顿夫人说了一句话：“雨下得好大呀！”不过她知道，夫人之所以打岔，并非出于对自己的关心，而是因为她对她丈夫和母亲热衷于这种低级趣味，深为厌恶。她提出的这个话头当即被布兰登上校接了过去，因为他在任何场合都很照顾别人的情绪。于是，两人下雨长下雨短地说了一大堆。威洛比打开钢琴，要求玛丽安坐下来弹一支曲子。由于大家都想结束这个话题，这样一来，谈话就不了了之。但是埃丽诺受了这场虚惊，却不那么容易恢复镇静。">查看中文翻译</div>
