<div class="line_en">If he does return. Jon feared for Sam and Maester Aemon. Cotter Pyke had written from Eastwatch to report that the Storm Crow had sighted the wreckage of a galley along the coast of Skagos. Whether the broken ship was Blackbird, one of Stannis Baratheon's sellsails, or some passing trader, the crew of the Storm Crow had not been able to discern. I meant to send Gilly and the babe to safety. Did I send them to their graves instead?</div>

<div class="line_en">His candle had guttered out in a pool of wax, but morning light was shining through the shutters of his window. Jon had fallen asleep over his work again. Books covered his table, tall stacks of them. He'd fetched them up himself, after spending half the night searching through dusty vaults by lantern light. Sam was right, the books desperately needed to be sorted, listed, and put in order, but that was no task for stewards who could neither read nor write. It would need to wait for Sam's return.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="蜡烛渐渐溶化燃尽，而曙光正在窗户的百叶上闪耀着。琼恩再次在工作时睡着了。书籍覆盖了他的桌子，堆积如山。他借着提灯的光搜遍了灰尘弥漫的地下室，花了半个夜晚的时间才把它们带上来。山姆是对的，这些书极需分类、列表和整理，然而这项工作无法交给一个既不能读也不能写的事务官。这也许需要等到山姆归来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Last night's supper had congealed beside his elbow, scarce touched. Dolorous Edd had filled his trencher almost to overflowing to allow Three-Finger Hobb's infamous three-meat stew to soften the stale bread. The jest among the brothers was that the three meats were mutton, mutton, and mutton, but carrot, onion, and turnip would have been closer to the mark. A film of cold grease glistened atop the remains of the stew.</div>

<div class="line_en">Bowen Marsh had urged him to move into the Old Bear's former chambers in the King's Tower after Stannis vacated them, but Jon had declined. Moving into the king's chambers could too easily be taken to mean he did not expect the king to return.</div>

<div class="line_en">A strange listlessness had settled over Castle Black since Stannis had marched south, as if the free folk and the black brothers alike were holding their breath, waiting to see what would come. The yards and dining hall were empty more oft than not, the Lord Commander's Tower was a shell, the old common hall a pile of blackened timbers, and Hardin's Tower looked as if the next gust of wind would knock it over. The only sound of life that Jon could hear was the faint clash of swords coming from the yard outside the armory. Iron Emmett was shouting at Hop-Robin to keep his shield up. We had all best keep our shields up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="自斯坦尼斯向东进军以来，一种异乎寻常的精神萎靡便降临在了黑堡，仿佛自由民和黑衣人兄弟同样在屏息而待，究竟会有什么即将到来。院子和餐厅经常是空的，司令塔是个外壳，古老的公共大厅堆叠着漆黑的木材，而哈丁塔看上去仿佛再来一阵强风就能将它吹到。军械库外的院子里传来剑与剑之间微弱的撞击声，这是琼恩唯一能够听到的生命之声。艾伦·艾米特正冲着跳脚罗宾（Hop-Robin）大喊，让他保持防御。我们必须保持良好的防御。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jon washed and dressed and left the armory, stopping in the yard outside just long enough to say a few words of encouragement to Hop-Robin and Emmett's other charges.

<div class="line_en">It was at times like this that Jon missed Maester Aemon the most. Clydas tended to the ravens well enough, but he had not a tenth of Aemon Targaryen's knowledge or experience, and even less of his wisdom. Bowen was a good man in his way, but the wound he had taken at the Bridge of Skulls had hardened his attitudes, and the only song he ever sang now was his familiar refrain about sealing the gates. Othell Yarwyck was as stolid and unimaginative as he was taciturn, and the First Rangers seemed to die as quick as they were named. The Night's Watch has lost too many of its best men, Jon reflected, as the wagons began to move. The Old Bear, Qhorin Halfhand, Donal Noye, Jarmen Buckwell, my uncle…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这种时候，琼恩总会非常想念伊蒙学士。Clydas把渡鸦们照顾的很好，可他的学问和经历还不及伊蒙·坦格利安的十分之一，更别提他的智慧了。鲍文用自己的方式做着好人，但在颅骨桥受到的创伤让他变得顽固不化，如今他唯一的论调就是封上大门。欧塞尔·亚维克因为沉默寡言而显得冷漠无趣，而首席游骑兵死的如同命名一样迅速。守夜人失去了太多优秀的伙伴，当马车开始移动时，琼恩想道。熊老，断掌科林，唐纳·诺伊，贾曼·巴克威尔，我的叔叔…">查看中文翻译</div>

The last few trips had seen some ugliness at Mole's Town, a little pushing and shoving, some muttered curses, a lot of sullen looks. Bowen Marsh felt it best not to take chances, and for once he and Jon were agreed.</div>

<div class="line_en">The wagons continued on their slow way south through frozen mud and blowing snow. A mile farther on, they came upon a second face, carved into a chestnut tree that grew beside an icy stream, where its eyes could watch the old plank bridge that spanned its flow. "Twice as much trouble," announced Dolorous Edd.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="马车穿过冻土和吹雪，继续缓慢的向南前进。在一英里更远处，他们遇到刻在栗树上的第二张脸，它生长在结冰的小河边，眼睛能看到跨河而建的古木桥。“两倍的麻烦，”忧郁的艾迪宣布。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jon glanced back at the face, wondering who had carved it. He had posted guards around Mole's Town, both to keep his crows away from the wildling women and to keep the free folk from slipping off southward to raid. Whoever had carved up the ash had eluded his sentries, plainly. And if one man could slip through the cordon, others could as well. I could double the guard again, he thought sourly. Waste twice as many men, men who might otherwise be walking the Wall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="琼恩回头瞥了一眼树脸，思考是谁把它雕刻出来。他在鼹鼠村周围布置了警戒，不仅为了让他的乌鸦远离野人妇女，也为了避免自由民溜向南方展开偷袭。很显然，无论在灰树上雕刻的人是谁，他都避开了哨兵。如果有一个人能溜出警戒线，那么其他人也同样可以。我要再次把守卫的数量翻倍，他郁闷的想。如大多数人那样把他们杀死两次，否则这些人可能会成为长城的尸鬼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The chestnut was leafless and skeletal, but its bare brown limbs were not empty. On a low branch overhanging the stream a raven sat hunched, its feathers ruffled up against the cold. When it spied Jon it spread its wings and gave a scream. When he raised his fist and whistled, the big black bird came flapping down, crying, "Corn, corn, corn."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="栗树光秃秃并且瘦骨嶙峋，然而它裸露的棕色主枝却没有变空。在悬于溪流的低矮的树枝上，停着一只驼背的渡鸦，竖着羽毛抵御寒冷。当它发现琼恩时便展开翅膀发出一阵尖叫。他刚举起拳头呼啸，这个黑色大鸟便鸣叫着振翅飞下，“玉米，玉米，玉米。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Just north of Mole's Town they came upon the third watcher, carved into the huge oak that marked the village perimeter, its deep eyes fixed upon the kingsroad. That is not a friendly face, Jon Snow reflected. The faces that the First Men and the children of the forest had carved into the weirwoods in eons past had stern or savage visages more oft than not, but the great oak looked especially angry, as if it were about to tear its roots from the earth and come roaring after them. Its wounds are as fresh as the wounds of the men who carved it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="仅仅在鼹鼠村的北面，他们就发现了第三个观察者。它被刻在一颗巨大的橡树上，标志村庄的周围，深陷的眼睛注视着国王大道。那不是张友好的脸，琼恩·雪诺思索到。在过去的数个世纪里，先民与森林之子在鱼梁木上刻画的面孔表情严肃，或者多半是些野蛮的面容，然而这颗巨大的橡树看起来却格外的生气，仿佛它正要将自己的根从地底中拔出并在他们身后咆哮。它的创伤如同刻画它的人一样新鲜。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Corn for the free folk," Jon told him. "None for you." He wondered if they would all be reduced to eating ravens before the coming winter had run its course.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“玉米是给自由民的，”琼恩对他说，“没东西给你。”他想假如按现在的发展他们也许会在凛冬到来之前就沦落到吃渡鸦为生了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The brothers on the wagons had seen this face as well, Jon did not doubt. No one spoke of it, but the message was plain to read for any man with eyes. Jon had once heard Mance Rayder say that most kneelers were sheep. "Now, a dog can herd a flock of sheep," the King-Beyond-the-Wall had said, "but free folk, well, some are shadowcats and some are stones. One kind prowls where they please and will tear your dogs to pieces. The other will not move at all unless you kick them." Neither shadowcats nor stones were like to give up the gods they had worshiped all their lives to bow down before one they hardly knew.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="马车上的兄弟同样看到了这张脸。琼恩毫不怀疑。没人谈论它，然而无论谁的眼中都透露出可以清晰读懂的讯息。琼恩曾今听曼斯·雷德说过，大部分的屈膝者是绵羊。“一条狗可以看管一群羊，”塞外之王说，“而自由民，好吧，他们有一些是影子山猫，有一些是石头。一种在他们想要的地方潜行并且会把你的狗撕成碎片，另一种除非你踢他们否则动也不动。”影子山猫和石头都不愿意放弃他们一生崇拜的神直到在一个他们几乎不知道的神面前屈服。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mole's Town had always been larger than it seemed; most of it was underground, sheltered from the cold and snow. That was more true than ever now. The Magnar of Thenn had put the empty village to the torch when he passed through on his way to attack Castle Black, and only heaps of blackened beams and old scorched stones remained aboveground… but down beneath the frozen earth, the vaults and tunnels and deep cellars still endured, and that was where the free folk had taken refuge, huddled together in the dark like the moles from which the village took its name.</div>

<div class="line_en">The wagons drew up in a crescent in front of what had once been the village smithy. Nearby a swarm of red-faced children were building a snow fort, but they scattered at the sight of the black-cloaked brothers, vanishing down one hole or another. A few moments later the adults began to emerge from the earth. A stench came with them, the smell of unwashed bodies and soiled clothing, of nightsoil and urine. Jon saw one of his men wrinkle his nose and say something to the man beside him. Some jape about the smell of freedom, he guessed. Too many of his brothers were making japes about the stench of the savages in Mole's Town.</div>

Fifty, sixty, maybe as many as a hundred. Fell's count had included men who had suffered wounds, Jon knew. He saw a score of those -- men on crude crutches, men with empty sleeves and missing hands, men with one eye or half a face, a legless man carried between two friends.
