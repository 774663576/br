<div class="line_en">Fortunately, Mr. Pendanski delivered the water more often than Mr. Sir. Mr. Pendanski was obviously aware of what Mr. Sir was doing, because he always gave Stanley a little extra. He'd fill Stanley's canteen, then let Stanley take a long drink, then top it off for him.</div>

<div class="line_en">He glanced at his canteen lying beside his hole. He knew it was half full, but he didn't take a drink just yet. He had to drink sparingly, because he didn't know who would be driving the water truck the next time it came.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他瞥了一眼躺在洞旁的水壶，明知道还有半壶水，他还是没有喝一口。他得省着点水，天知道下一次来送水的会是谁。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It helped, too, that Zero was digging some of Stanley's hole for him. Although, as Stanley had expected, the other boys didn't like to see Stanley sitting around while they were working. They'd say things like "Who died and made you king?" or "It must be nice to have your own personal slave."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="零蛋替斯坦利挖一部分，这也帮了大忙。尽管果然不出斯坦利所料，干活时看到斯坦利坐在一旁休息，别的男孩都很不满。他们会说“谁死了，轮到你当老大啊”或者“有个私人的奴隶可真不错啊”之类的话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stanley dug his shovel into the ground. His hole was about three and a half feet deep in the center. He grunted as he pried up some dirt, then flung it off to the side. The sun was almost directly overhead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利把铲子插进土里。洞的正中央已经有三英尺半深了。他哼哼着铲起一些土，抛到一旁。太阳已经快爬到正当空了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Three days had passed since the Warden had scratched Mr. Sir. Every time Mr. Sir delivered water, he poured Stanley's straight onto the ground.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“不，不是那样的。”X光应声道，“一定不是那样的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Same old story, ain't it, Armpit?" X-Ray had said. "The white boy sits around while the black boy does all the work. Ain't that right, Caveman?"</div>

<div class="line_en">When he tried pointing out that he was the one who took the blame for the sunflower seeds, the other boys said it was his fault because he was the one who spilled them. "I risked my life for those seeds," Magnet had said, "and all I got was one lousy handful."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当斯坦利指出在葵花子的事情上是他一个人承担了全部责任时，其他男孩却说那就是他的错，因为他把葵花子弄撒了。“我冒着生命危险才搞到那些葵花子，”吸铁石说，“可我却只捞到了一小把。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stanley dug out another shovelful of dirt. He knew X-Ray wouldn't have been talking like that if he was the one teaching Zero to read. Then X-Ray would be talking about how important it was that he got his rest, right? So he could be a better teacher, right?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利又挖了一铲土。他知道如果是X光教零蛋识字，他就不会这么说了。X光会说休息对他来说非常重要，对不对？这样他才能做一个更好的老师，对不对？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stanley had also tried to explain that he needed to save his energy so he could teach Zero how to read, but the other boys just mocked him.</div>

<div class="line_en">"No, that's not right," Stanley replied.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，不是那样的。”斯坦利回应。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And that was true. He did need to save his strength so he could be a better teacher, although Zero was a quick learner. Sometimes, in fact, Stanley hoped the Warden was watching them, with her secret cameras and microphones, so she'd know that Zero wasn't as stupid as everyone thought.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="完全没错。尽管零蛋学得很快，但斯坦利还是需要保存体力，这样才能成为更好的老师。实际上，有时候斯坦利希望管理员大人正通过秘密摄像头和话筒监视他们，这样她就会明白零蛋并不像大家想的那么愚蠢。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The swelling on Mr. Sir's face had gone down, but it was still a little puffy. There had been three scratch marks down his cheek. Two of the marks had faded, but the middle scratch must have been the deepest, because it still remained. It was a jagged purple line running from below his eye to below his mouth, like a tattoo of a scar.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="长官先生脸上的红肿已经有点消了，但还是没有完全退去。他的脸上原先有三道抓痕，现在有两道已经消了，中间那道应该是抓得最狠的，因为至今还没有消失。那道锯齿状的青紫色疤痕从眼睛下方一直延伸到嘴巴下面，就像是文上去的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He brought the canteen back to his hole. For a long time, he left it beside his hole as he continued to dig. Then, when he was so thirsty that he could hardly stand it anymore, he unscrewed the cap, turned the canteen over, and poured it all out onto the dirt. He was afraid that if he'd waited another second, he might have taken a drink.</div>
