<div class="line_en">Early the next morning, Theresa was sleeping soundly when the sound of a ringing phone jarred her awake. Fumbling for the phone, she recognized Garrett's voice instantly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Did you make it home okay?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes. I stayed up late last night waiting for your call. I started to wonder if you'd forgotten your promise."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Good. Tired, but good."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I didn't forget. I just figured you needed a little time to settle in."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Garrett laughed. "Sorry about that. How was the flight? How are you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But you were confident I'd be up at the crack of dawn, right?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"A little after six. Did I wake you?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"I miss you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yeah, I did," she replied groggily. "What time is it?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"You do?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yeah-I went in to do work yesterday even though the shop was closed, hoping to get some paperwork done, but I couldn't do much because I kept thinking about you."</div>

<div class="line_en">Entering the office later than usual, Theresa felt the effects of her whirlwind adventure finally catching up with her. She hadn't slept much, and when she'd looked in the mirror after talking to Garrett on the phone, she'd felt sure that she looked at least a decade older than she was. As usual, the first place she went once she got to work was the break room for a cup of coffee, and on this morning she added a second packet of sugar to give her an extra jolt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I hope so. I'd hate to think I was the only one who felt this way."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm sitting on the back deck, watching the sun come up. Why?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Because you're not here with me to enjoy it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She paused. "Where are you now?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Theresa thought about the view she was missing. "Is it beautiful?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Why not?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It always is, but this morning, I'm not enjoying it as much as I usually do."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She lay back on the bed, making herself comfortable. "Hey-I miss you, too."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'll try to keep it in check, then."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, you'll manage."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She smiled, holding the phone to her ear with one hand and absently twirling a strand of her hair with the other, until they finally said a reluctant good-bye twenty minutes later and hung up the phone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's the truth. I don't know how I'm going to get any work done over the next couple of weeks."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I might not be able to sleep, either."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She laughed, knowing he was teasing. "Now, don't go that far. I'm not into those superdependent guys, you know. I like my men to be men."</div>

<div class="line_en">Barely listening to what Deanna had said, Theresa reached for the card leaning against the vase and opened it immediately. Deanna stood behind her, craning over her shoulder. It read:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, hello, Theresa," Deanna said happily, striding in behind her. "I thought you'd never get here. I've been dying to hear everything that happened."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm just glad you made it at all. I almost ran over to your apartment last night to talk to you, but I didn't know what time you got in."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Deanna leaned against the counter. "Well, that's not a surprise. I've already put two and two together."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm sorry for not calling, but I was a little worn out from my week," she said.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">To the most beautiful woman I know-Now that I'm alone again, nothing is as it once was. The sky is grayer, the ocean is more forbidding. Will you make it right? The only way is to see me again.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I think," Theresa said, glancing around the newsroom at all the people watching her discreetly, "that I'd rather talk to you about it later, when we're alone. I don't need the whole office gossiping about it."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Of course not. To be honest, I kind of like leaving them in suspense." She gave a small wink after looking around the newsroom. "Listen, Theresa, I've got some work to do. Do you think we could have lunch today? Then we can talk."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That sounds great. And Deanna… thanks for keeping it a secret."</div>

<div class="line_en">"No problem."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Tell him it's someone who wants to schedule some dive lessons in a couple of weeks." She tried to sound as distant as she could, not sure if Ian knew about them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Deanna patted Theresa's shoulder gently and headed back to her office. Theresa leaned over her desk and smelled the roses again before moving the vase to the corner of her desk. She began to sort through her mail for a couple of minutes, pretending not to notice the flowers until the newsroom resumed its chaotic patterns. Making sure that no one was paying attention, she picked up the phone and dialed Garrett at work.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ian put her on hold, and there was silence for a short moment. Then the line clicked and Garrett came on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Can I help you?" he asked, sounding a little frazzled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I did. I told them you were sixty-eight and with a horrible lisp that made it impossible to understand you. But since you were so pitiful, I went ahead and had lunch with you. And now, unfortunately, you're stalking me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After they had hung up, Theresa sat quietly for a moment, reaching for the card again. She read it once more, and this time, instead of putting it back with the flowers, she placed it in her purse for safekeeping. Knowing this crowd, she was sure someone would read it when she wasn't looking.</div>

<div class="line_en">Deanna sat across from Theresa at the table in the restaurant. Theresa handed Deanna the pictures from her vacation.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Since Theresa had already told her about meeting Garrett at the docks, she picked up her story from the evening they spent sailing. She told Deanna how she had purposely left her jacket on board as an excuse to see him again-to which Deanna replied, "Marvelous!" -- moving on to their lunch the next day and finally to their dinner. Recapping the final four days they spent together, she left very little out as Deanna listened with rapt attention.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You are, Theresa. What did you expect? You knew he was still struggling with Catherine before you went down there.

<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Though you knew something about Garrett, he knew absolutely nothing about you. Yet he was the one who asked you to go sailing. So something between you two must have clicked right away. Next, you see him again when you pick up your jacket, and he asks you to lunch. He tells you about Catherine and then asks you to come over for dinner. After that, you spend four wonderful days together getting to know-and care for-each other. Had you told me before you'd left that this is what would have happened, I wouldn't have believed it possible. But it did-that's the thing. And now, you two are planning to see each other again. To me, it sounds like the whole thing was a smashing success."</div>

<div class="line_en">Deanna shook her head. "Not exactly. But look-you've got to take this one step at a time. The fact is, you only spent a few days together so far-that's not enough time to make a decision about something like this. If I were you, I'd see how you both feel over the next couple of weeks, and when you see him the next time, you're bound to know a lot more than you know now."</div>

<div class="line_en">While Theresa and Deanna were eating, Garrett was working in his office behind a giant stack of papers when the door opened. Jeb Blake entered, making sure that his son was alone before closing the door behind him.

<div class="line_en">Theresa didn't want to send him flowers or candy, so instead she sent him a light blue oxford shirt she thought would look good his jeans, along with a couple of cards.</div>

<div class="line_en">Later that night, with the remnants of his father's comments rolling through his head, Garrett couldn't sleep. He rose from his bed and went to the kitchen, knowing what needed to be done. In the drawer, he found the stationery he always used when his mind was conflicted, and he sat down with the hopes of putting his thoughts into words.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Kevin arrived home a few days later, and it made the next week pass much more quickly for Theresa than for Garrett. His first night home, Kevin ate dinner with Theresa, telling her about his vacation in fits and starts before collapsing into a deep sleep for almost fifteen hours. When he woke, there was already a long list of things that needed to be done. He needed new clothes for school-he'd already outgrown most of what he'd worn the previous year-and he had to sign up for fall league soccer, which ended up taking almost an entire Saturday. In addition, he'd come home with a suitcase full of dirty laundry that needed to be washed, he wanted to develop the pictures he'd taken on his vacation, and he had a Tuesday afternoon appointment with the orthodontist to see if he needed braces.</div>

<div class="line_en">Over the next two weeks, Garrett and Theresa spoke on the phone every night, sometimes for hours. Garrett also sent a couple of letters-short notes, really-to let her know that he missed her, and he had another dozen roses delivered the following week, this time with a box of candy.</div>

<div class="line_en">In other words, life was back to normal at the Osborne household. On Kevin's second night back, Theresa told him about her vacation at the Cape, then about her trip to Wilmington. She mentioned Garrett, trying to convey how she felt about him without alarming Kevin. At first, when she explained how they were going to visit him the following weekend, Kevin didn't sound so sure about it. But after she told him what Garrett did for a living, Kevin began to show some signs of interest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You mean he might teach me how to scuba dive?" he asked as she was vacuuming the house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He said that he would, if you wanted to."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A few nights later she took him to the store to get him a few magazines about diving. By the time they were ready to leave, Kevin knew the name of every piece of equipment it was possible to own, obviously dreaming about his upcoming adventure. Garrett, meanwhile, plunged ahead with work. He worked late, thinking about Theresa while he did so, acting much the same way he had after Catherine's death. When he mentioned to his father how much he missed Theresa, his father only nodded and smiled. Something in his father's assessing gaze made Garrett wonder what exactly was going through the old man's mind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Cool," he said, returning to whatever he'd been doing before.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the last two weeks his feelings for Theresa had grown. He knew now that whatever happened between him and Theresa wasn't based simply on physical attraction-his longing hinted at something much deeper, more lasting. As he craned his neck for a glimpse of her among the passengers, he felt a pang of anxiety. It had been so long since he'd felt this way about anyone-and where was it all going?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Theresa stepped off the plane with Kevin beside her, all his nervousness suddenly faded away. She was beautiful-more so than he remembered. And Kevin-he looked exactly like his picture and a lot like his mother. He was a little over five feet, with Theresa's dark hair and eyes, and gangly-both his arms and his legs seemed to have grown a little faster than the rest of him. He was wearing long Bermuda shorts, Nike shoes, and a shirt from a concert by Hootie and the Blowfish. His choice of apparel was clearly inspired by MTV and Garrett couldn't help but smile to himself. Boston, Wilmington… it really didn't matter, did it? Kids would be kids.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">By prior agreement, both Theresa and Garrett had decided it would be best if she and Kevin didn't stay at Garrett's house, but because it was still summer, nearly every room in town was booked. Luckily Garrett knew the owner of a small motel a mile up the beach from Garrett's house, and he had been able to make arrangements for their stay.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When the day finally came for Theresa and Kevin to visit, Garrett bought some groceries, washed his truck inside and out, and showered before heading to the airport. Dressed in khaki pants, Top-Siders, and the shirt that Theresa had bought him, he waited nervously at the gate.</div>

<div class="line_en">Three hours later, long after Kevin was asleep, Theresa quietly led Garrett to the door. After stepping out into the hall and closing the door behind them, they kissed for a long time, both of them finding it hard to let each other go. In his arms Theresa felt like a teenager again, as if she were sneaking a kiss on her parents' porch, and it somehow added to the excitement she was feeling.</div>

She heard his feet thumping as he raced down the hall. After standing and stretching her arms above her head, she made her way to the small table. She picked up the book and started in on the first chapter just as he returned with two Cokes. "Here you go," he said, putting one on the table beside her. "I'm going to shower and get ready. Where'd you put my swimsuit?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Luckily Garrett had been right when he'd told her that the information wasn't difficult. It was easy reading with pictures describing the equipment, and she was finished by the time Kevin was dressed. After finding her test, she set it in front of her. Kevin walked over and stood behind her as she glanced at the first question. Remembering where she'd read about it, she began to flip back through the book to the appropriate page.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Okay," he said, pulling the drawer open, "got it." He went to the bathroom and Theresa listened as the shower was turned on. Opening her Coke, she returned to the book.</div>

<div class="line_en">Throughout the morning and early afternoon, Garrett taught them the basics of scuba diving. They learned how the equipment worked, how to put it on and test it, and finally how to breathe through the mouthpiece, first on the side of the pool, then underwater. "The most important thing to remember," Garrett explained, "is to breathe normally. Don't hold your breath, don't breathe too quickly or slowly. Just let it come naturally." Of course, nothing seemed natural about it to Theresa, and she ended up having more trouble with it than Kevin. Kevin, always the adventurer, thought that after a few minutes underwater he knew all there was to know.</div>

<div class="line_en">They made love tenderly, quietly, and afterward they lay beside each other. For a long time, neither of them spoke. When the faintest hint of light began to brush the horizon, they kissed good night and she returned to the bedroom. Within a few minutes she was sleeping soundly, and Garrett watched her from the doorway.</div>

This time the lessons were a little more advanced, covering a number of different skills. Theresa and Kevin practiced "buddy breathing" in the event that either one of them ran out of air when underwater and had to share one tank, and Garrett warned of the dangers of panicking while diving and rushing to the surface too quickly. "If you do that, you'll get what's called 'the bends.' It's not only painful-it can be life-threatening."</div>

<div class="line_en">They also spent time in the deep end of the pool, swimming underwater for extended periods, getting used to the equipment and practicing how to clear their ears.

Garrett taught Kevin the basics of sailing-from how and when to tack to anticipating the direction of the wind based on the clouds. As on their first date together, they had sandwiches and salads, but this time they were treated to a family of porpoises that frolicked around the boat as they ate.</div>

Since all three of them were exhausted, Theresa and Garrett said good-bye quickly, and both Theresa and Kevin were in bed by the time Garrett arrived back at his house. The following day, Garrett took them out for their first ocean dive. After the initial nervousness wore off, they began to enjoy themselves and ended up going through two tanks each over the course of the afternoon. Thanks to the calm, coastal weather, the water was clear, with excellent visibility. Garrett took a few photos of them as they explored one of the shallow-water wrecks off the North Carolina coast. He promised to have them developed that week and to send them up as soon as he could.</div>
