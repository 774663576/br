<div class="line_en">It's one of those places that are supposed to be very sophisticated and all, and the phonies are coming in the window. They used to have these two French babes, Tina and Janine, come out and play the piano and sing about three times every night. One of them played the piano -- strictly lousy -- and the other one sang, and most of the songs were either pretty dirty or in French. The one that sang, old Janine, was always whispering into the goddam microphone before she sang. She'd say, "And now we like to geeve you our impression of Vooly Voo Fransay. Eet ees the story of a leetle Fransh girl who comes to a beeg ceety, just like New York, and falls een love wees a leetle boy from Brookleen. We hope you like eet." Then, when she was all done whispering and being cute as hell, she'd sing some dopey song, half in English and half in French, and drive all the phonies in the place mad with joy. If you sat around there long enough and heard all the phonies applauding and all, you got to hate everybody in the world, I swear you did. The bartender was a louse, too. He was a big snob. He didn't talk to you at all hardly unless you were a big shot or a celebrity or something. If you were a big shot or a celebrity or something, then he was even more nauseating. He'd go up to you and say, with this big charming smile, like he was a helluva swell guy if you knew him, "Well! How's Connecticut?" or "How's Florida?" It was a terrible place, I'm not kidding. I cut out going there entirely, gradually.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was pretty early when I got there. I sat down at the bar -- it was pretty crowded -- and had a couple of Scotch and sodas before old Luce even showed up. I stood up when I ordered them so they could see how tall I was and all and not think I was a goddam minor. Then I watched the phonies for a while. Some guy next to me was snowing hell out of the babe he was with. He kept telling her she had aristocratic hands. That killed me. The other end of the bar was full of flits. They weren't too flitty-looking -- I mean they didn't have their hair too long or anything -- but you could tell they were flits anyway. Finally old Luce showed up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我到那儿时间还早，就在酒柜边坐下――酒吧里挤得很――在老路斯没来之前先喝两杯掺苏打水的威士忌。我要酒的时候，还特地站起来，让他们看看我的身材有多高，免得他们怀疑我是个未成年的混帐娃娃。这以后，我就观察一会儿那些假模假式的男女。我旁边的一个家伙正在用甜言蜜语一个劲儿哄骗跟他在一起的姑娘。他口口声声说她的那双手很象贵族。差点儿笑死我了。酒柜的另一头坐的全是些搞同性爱的性变态者。看他们的样子倒不太象那样的人――我是说他们的头发并不过于长，也没有其它怪相――可你总看得出他们是搞同性爱的。最后老路斯来了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Old Luce. What a guy. He was supposed to be my Student Adviser when I was at Whooton. The only thing he ever did, though, was give these sex talks and all, late at night when there was a bunch of guys in his room. He knew quite a bit about sex, especially perverts and all. He was always telling us about a lot of creepy guys that go around having affairs with sheep, and guys that go around with girls' pants sewed in the lining of their hats and all. And flits and Lesbians. Old Luce knew who every flit and Lesbian in the United States was. All you had to do was mention somebody -- anybody -- and old Luce'd tell you if he was a flit or not. Sometimes it was hard to believe, the people he said were flits and Lesbians and all, movie actors and like that. Some of the ones he said were flits were even married, for God's sake. You'd keep saying to him, "You mean Joe Blow's a flit? Joe Blow? That big, tough guy that plays gangsters and cowboys all the time?" Old Luce'd say, "Certainly." He was always saying "Certainly." He said it didn't matter if a guy was married or not. He said half the married guys in the world were flits and didn't even know it. He said you could turn into one practically overnight, if you had all the traits and all. He used to scare the hell out of us. I kept waiting to turn into a flit or something. The funny thing about old Luce, I used to think he was sort of flitty himself, in a way. He was always saying, "Try this for size," and then he'd goose the hell out of you while you were going down the corridor. And whenever he went to the can, he always left the goddam door open and talked to you while you were brushing your teeth or something. That stuff's sort of flitty. It really is. I've known quite a few real flits, at schools and all, and they're always doing stuff like that, and that's why I always had my doubts about old Luce. He was a pretty intelligent guy, though. He really was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="老路斯，了不起的家伙。我在胡敦念书的时候，他本应该是我的辅导员。可他只做一件事，就是在夜深人静的时候在他的房间里纠集一帮人大谈其性问题。他对性问题颇有研究，特别是性变态者之类。他老讲给我们听有些可怕的家伙怎样胡来，以及怎样把女人的裤子当作衬里缝在自己的帽子上。还有搞同性爱的男男女女。老路斯知道在美国搞同性爱的每一个男女。只要你提出一个人的名字――任何一个人的名字――老路斯就会告诉你他是不是搞同性爱的。有时候你简直很难相信，他把那些电影明星之流的男女都说成是搞同性爱的。有几个据他说是搞同性爱的男人甚至都结了婚，我的老天爷。你这么问他：“你说乔。勃罗是个搞同性爱的？乔。勃罗？那个老在电影里演流氓和牛仔的又魁伟又神气的家伙？”老路斯就会说：“当然啦。”他老是说“当然啦”。他说在这件事上结婚不结婚无关紧要。他说世界上有一半结了婚的男子都是搞同性爱的，可他们自己不知道。他还说只要你有那迹象，简直一夜之间就可以变成一个搞同性爱的。他常常把我们吓得魂不附体。我就一直等着自己突然变成一个搞同性爱的。说起老路斯来，有一点倒是很好笑，我心里老怀疑他本人就搞同性爱。他老是说，“这件事你可以实地干一下拭试。”你走到走廊上的时候，他还会在你后面拼命呵痒。……这类玩艺儿就有搞同性爱的迹象。一点不假。我在学校里认识一些搞同性爱的家伙，他们就老是搞这一套玩艺儿，所以我不免要疑心起老路斯来。不过他为人的确很聪明。一点儿不假。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I was getting a little too personal. I realize that. But that was one of the annoying things about Luce. When we were at Whooton, he'd make you describe the most personal stuff that happened to you, but if you started asking him questions about himself, he got sore. These intellectual guys don't like to have an intellectual conversation with you unless they're running the whole thing. They always want you to shut up when they shut up, and go back to your room when they go back to their room. When I was at Whooton old Luce used to hate it -- you really could tell he did -- when after he was finished giving his sex talk to a bunch of us in his room we stuck around and chewed the fat by ourselves for a while. I mean the other guys and myself. In somebody else's room. Old Luce hated that. He always wanted everybody to go back to their own room and shut up when he was finished being the big shot. The thing he was afraid of, he was afraid somebody'd say something smarter than he had. He really amused me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我问的都有点儿涉及私人隐事了。我明白这一点。可老路斯就是这些地方让你觉得不痛快。我在胡敦的时候，他会叫你把你自己最最隐秘的事情形容给他听，可你只要一问起有关他自己的事情，他就会生起气来。这般聪明人就是这样，如果不是他们自己在发号施令，就不高兴跟你进行一场有意思的谈话。他们自己一住嘴，也就要你住嘴，他们一回到他们自己的房间，也就要你回到你自己的房间。我在胡敦的时候，老路斯一向痛恨这样的事――那就是他在他自己的房间里向我们一伙人谈完性问题后，我们还聚集在一起继续聊一会儿天。我是说另外那些家伙跟我自己。在别人的房间里。老路斯痛恨这类事情。他只喜欢自己一个人当大亨，等他把话说完，就希望每个人都回到自己的房间里不再言语。他最害怕的，就是怕有人说出来的话比他高明。他的确引得我很开心。">查看中文翻译</div>
