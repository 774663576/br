<div class="line_en">He sat on the floor of the pantry with his legs out in front of him, a box of Triscuit crackers between them, looking at the door. He was eating the crackers one by one, not tasting them, only eating them because he had to eat something. When he got out of here, he was going to need his strength. All of it.</div>

<div class="line_en">At this precise instant, he thought he had never felt quite so miserable in his entire life. His mind and body together made up a large-writ scripture of pain. His head ached terribly, the sick throb of a hangover. The attendant symptoms were there, too: his mouth tasted like a manure rake had taken a swing through it, his ears rung, his heart had an extra-heavy, thudding beat, like a tom-tom. In addition, both shoulders ached fiercely from throwing himself against the door and his throat felt raw and peeled from useless shouting. He had cut his right hand on the doorlatch.</div>

<div class="line_en">He munched the Triscuits one by one, refusing to give in to his wretched stomach, which wanted to vomit up everything. He thought of the Excedrins in his pocket and decided to wait until his stomach had quieted a bit. No sense swallowing a painkiller if you were going to throw it right back up.

<div class="line_en">The thing he'd never asked himself, Jack realized now, was exactly what had driven his daddy to drink in the first place. And really… when you came right down to what his old students had been pleased to call the nifty-gritty… hadn't it been the woman he was married to? A milksop sponge of a woman, always dragging silently around the house with an expression of doomed martyrdom on her face? A ball and chain around Daddy's ankle? No, not ball and chain. She had never actively tried to make Daddy a prisoner, the way Wendy had done to him. For Jack's father it must have been more like the fate of McTeague the dentist at the end of Frank Norris's great novel: handcuffed to a dead man in the wasteland. Yes, that was better. Mentally and spiritually dead, his mother had been handcuffed to his father by matrimony. Still, Daddy had tried to do right as he dragged her rotting corpse through life. He had tried to bring the four children up to know right from wrong, to understand discipline, and above all, to respect their father.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰克现在认识到，他从来没有问过自己：到底一开始是什么驱使父亲去喝酒的。确实…当你追根溯源到他过去的学生喜欢称为“本质”的东西的时候…难道那不正是那个和他同床共枕的女人吗？一个逆来顺受的女人，总是不声不响地在家里四处转悠，脸上带着受尽委屈的表情？她是父亲脚脖子上的锁链和铁球？不，不是铁球和锁链。她从来没有像温迪对他这样把他父亲囚禁起来。父亲的情形一定更像弗兰克·诺里斯的那部伟大的小说的结尾处牙医麦克蒂格的命运：在荒野里与一具死尸铐在一起。是的，这样说更好些。在心理上和精神上已经死去的母亲通过婚姻与他父亲铐在一起。但是，拖着她日益腐烂的尸体苦苦度日的同时，父亲仍然努力尽到了职责。他尽其所能把四个孩子培养成明辨是非、懂规矩守纪律的人，最重要的是，他们尊重自己的父亲。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Well, they had been ingrates, all of them, himself included. And now he was paying the price; his own son had turned out to be an ingrate, too. But there was hope. He would get out of here somehow. He would chastise them both, and harshly. He would set Danny an example, so that the day might come when Danny was grown, a day when Danny would know what to do better than he himself had known.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，他们都是忘恩负义的人，他们全部，包括杰克自己。现在，轮到他还账了，自己的儿子原来也是个不知感恩的不肖子。但是还有希望，无论如何，他必须出去。他要惩罚他们俩，狠狠地惩罚。他要给丹尼树一个榜样，这样那一天才会到来——丹尼比他本人更知道何为上策的那一天。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He remembered the Sunday dinner when his father had caned his mother at the table… how horrified he and the others had been. Now he could see how necessary that had been, how his father had only been feigning drunkenness, how his wits had been sharp and alive underneath all along, watching for the slightest sign of disrespect.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他记起了他父亲在桌边用手杖打他母亲的那个周日晚餐…他和其他人被吓成了什么样子。现在他终于看出那是多么地必要，他父亲是如何在装醉，他父亲是何等地高明，他洞察到了最细微的不敬的迹象。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jack crawled after the Triscuits and began to eat them again, sitting by the door she had so treacherously bolted. He wondered exactly what his father had seen, and how he had caught her out by his playacting. Had she been sneering at him behind her hand? Sticking her tongue out? Making obscene finger gestures? Or only looking at him insolently and arrogantly, convinced that he was too stupidly drunk to see? Whatever it had been, he had caught her at it, and he had chastised her sharply. And now, twenty years later, he could finally appreciate Daddy's wisdom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰克爬过去捡饼干，然后又开始吃起来，坐在门边——温迪竟如此无情无义地把它闩上了。他不知道父亲究竟发现了什么，不知道他是用什么花招觉察到母亲的错误的。她捂着嘴在嘲笑他吗？她对他伸出了舌头？用指头做了下流动作？或者仅仅是傲慢无礼地看着他，以为他醉得任人不屑一顾了？不管是什么，他发现了她的毛病，并狠狠地惩罚了她。而如今，20年过后，他终于能欣赏他父亲的睿智了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He wasn't going to be able to reason with her, he could see that now. He had tried to reason with her in the Colorado Lounge, and she had refused to listen, had hit him over the head with a bottle for his pains. But there would be another time, and soon. He would get out of here.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他现在明白了，他跟她讲不清道理。在科罗拉多休息厅他曾试图跟她理论，可让他伤心的是，她不但不听，还用酒瓶打伤了他的脑袋。但是，会有第二次的，很快。他会出去的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Of course you could say Daddy had been foolish to marry such a woman, to have handcuffed himself to that corpse in the first place… and a disrespectful corpse at that. But when the young marry in haste they must repent in leisure, and perhaps Daddy's daddy had married the same type of woman, so that unconsciously Jack's daddy had also married one, as Jack himself had. Except that his wife, instead of being satisfied with the passive role of having wrecked one career and crippled another, had opted for the poisonously active task of trying to destroy his last and best chance: to become a member of the Overlook's staff, and possibly to rise… all the way to the position of manager, in time. She was trying to deny him Danny, and Danny was his ticket of admission. That was foolish, of course -- why would they want the son when they could have the father? -- but employers often had foolish ideas and that was the condition that had been made.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，你可以说父亲很愚蠢，他竟跟这样一个女人结了婚，竟把自己跟这具尸体铐在了一起…而且是一具无礼的尸体。但是，年轻人草草结婚事后后悔的情况屡见不鲜，也许父亲的父亲就跟这类女人结了婚，结果杰克的父亲下意识地也和这类女人结了婚，杰克也如法仿效了。仅有一点不同之处：他自己的女人，不是满足于扮演毁掉丈夫的一个前程再掣肘另一个的消极角色，而是选择了恶毒的积极行动，摧毁他的最后也是最好的机会——成为一名远望饭店职员，也许…平步青云，并且有朝一日登上经理宝座。她拒绝把丹尼交给他，而丹尼却是他的入场券。当然，这有点愚蠢——他们能要去父亲为什么还要儿子？——但是，雇主通常都有些愚蠢的想法。交出丹尼是他们订立的条件。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He suddenly held his breath and cocked his head. Somewhere a piano was playing boogie-woogie and people were laughing and clapping along. The sound was muffled through the heavy wooden door, but audible. The song was "There'll Be a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight." His hands curled helplessly into fists; he had to restrain himself from battering at the door with them. The party had begun again. The liquor would be flowing freely. Somewhere, dancing with someone else, would be the girl who had felt so maddeningly nude under her white silk gown.</div>
