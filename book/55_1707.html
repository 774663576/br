<div class="line_en">Luard designates 1789 as the start of the Age of Nationalism. The players in the preceding Age of Sovereignty had been sprawling dynastic empires that were not pinned to a "nation" in the sense of a group of people sharing a homeland, a language, and a culture. This new age was populated by states that were better aligned with nations and that competed with other nation-states for preeminence. Nationalist yearnings set off thirty wars of independence in Europe and led to autonomy for Belgium, Greece, Bulgaria, Albania, and Serbia. They also inspired the wars of national unification of Italy and of Germany. The peoples of Asia and Africa were not yet deemed worthy of national self-expression, so the European nation-states enhanced their own glory by colonizing them.</div>

<div class="line_en">World War I, in this scheme, was a culmination of these nationalist longings. It was ignited by Serbian nationalism against the Habsburg Empire, inflamed by nationalist loyalties that pitted Germanic peoples against Slavic ones (and soon against the British and the French), and ended with the dismemberment of the multiethnic Habsburg and Ottoman empires into the new nation-states of Central and Eastern Europe.</div>

<div class="line_en">The concept of an Age of Nationalism is a bit procrustean. The age begins with the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars because they were inflamed by the national spirit of France, but these wars were just as inflamed by the ideological residue of the French Revolution, well before the so-called Age of Ideology. Also, the age is an unwieldy sandwich, with massively destructive wars at each end and two record-breaking intervals of peace (1815-54 and 1871-1914) in the middle.</div>

<div class="line_en">A better way to make sense of the past two centuries, Michael Howard has argued, is to see them as a battle for influence among four forces -- Enlightenment humanism, conservatism, nationalism, and utopian ideologies -- which sometimes joined up in temporary coalitions. Napoleonic France, because it emerged from the French Revolution, became associated in Europe with the French Enlightenment. In fact it is better classified as the first implementation of fascism. Though Napoleon did implement a few rational reforms such as the metric system and codes of civil law (which survive in many French-influenced regions today), in most ways he wrenched the clock back from the humanistic advances of the Enlightenment. He seized power in a coup, stamped out constitutional government, reinstituted slavery, glorified war, had the Pope crown him emperor, restored Catholicism as the state religion, installed three brothers and a brother-in-law on foreign thrones, and waged ruthless campaigns of territorial aggrandizement with a criminal disregard for human life.</div>

<div class="line_en">Revolutionary and Napoleonic France, Bell has shown, were consumed by a combination of French nationalism and utopian ideology. The ideology, like the versions of Christianity that came before it and the fascism and communism that would follow it, was messianic, apocalyptic, expansionist, and certain of its own rectitude. And it viewed its opponents as irredeemably evil: as existential threats that had to be eliminated in pursuit of a holy cause. Bell notes that the militant utopianism was a disfigurement of the Enlightenment ideal of humanitarian progress. To the revolutionaries, Kant's "goal of perpetual peace had value not because it conformed to a fundamental moral law but because it conformed to the historical progress of civilization… And so they opened the door to the idea that in the name of future peace, any and all means might be justified -- including even exterminatory war." Kant himself despised this turn, noting that such a war "would allow perpetual peace only upon the graveyard of the whole human race." And the American framers, equally aware of the crooked timber of humanity, were positively phobic about the prospect of imperial or messianic leaders.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="贝尔说过，拿破仑时代的法国崇尚法兰西民族主义和乌托邦思想的混合物。这种意识形态，就像它之前的基督教教义以及后来的法西斯主义等，都是弥撒亚式的，充满终极审判的狂热，坚定地追求领土扩张，并且坚信自己是正义的化身。它们都将自己的敌人视为不可救赎的恶魔：为了追求神圣的目标，必须彻底消灭这些恶魔的威胁。贝尔还说，激进好战的乌托邦主义是对启蒙主义人文理想的倒行逆施。对于革命而言，康德“追求永久和平这一目标的价值不仅在于它符合最基本的道德律，而且在于它符合人类文明的历史进步…因此，理所当然地，为了未来的和平，任何以及所有的手段都是正当的——甚至包括灭绝性的战争”。康德本人对这种阐释深恶痛绝，他认为，这样的战争将“永久和平埋葬在全人类的坟场上”。美国的建国之父们同样意识到人性中扭曲的成分，因此对具有帝国倾向和弥撒亚救世情结的领袖人物充满恐惧而予以坚决的抵制。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After the French ideology had been disseminated across Europe at the point of a bayonet and driven back at enormous cost, it elicited a slew of reactions, which as we saw in chapter 4 are often lumped together as counter-Enlightenments. Howard sees the common denominator as "the view that man is not simply an individual who by the light of reason and observation can formulate laws on the basis of which he can create a just and peaceful society, but rather a member of a community that has moulded him in a fashion he himself cannot fully comprehend, and which has a primary claim on his loyalties."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="法国革命的思想先是被拿破仑挂在刺刀上传遍欧洲，接着又在血雨腥风中被赶了出去，此后，正如我们在第4章中已经看到的，欧洲出现了一系列“反启蒙运动”的新思潮。霍华德将它们的共同之处归结为“个人作为一个个体，其所具有的理性和观察能力，不足以创造一种成为社会和平和公正基石的法律制度，相反，个人是一个社会的成员，社会塑造了个人，其塑造方式甚至是个人无法完全理解的，而社会有权要求个人对其保持忠诚”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Recall that there were two counter-Enlightenments, which reacted to the French disruptions in opposite ways. The first was Edmund Burke's conservatism, which held that a society's customs were time-tested implementations of a civilizing process that had tamed humanity's dark side and as such deserved respect alongside the explicit formal propositions of intellectuals and reformers. Burkean conservatism, itself a fine application of reason, represented a small tweaking of Enlightenment humanism. But that ideal was blown to bits in Johann Gottfried von Herder's romantic nationalism, which held that an ethnic group -- in the case of Herder, the German Volk -- had unique qualities that could not be submerged into the supposed universality of humankind, and that were held together by ties of blood and soil rather than by a reasoned social contract.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我在前面曾经提到两种反启蒙运动思想，从相反的两个方向抵制法国革命的观念。第一种是埃德蒙·伯克的保守主义，他认为社会习俗是文明进程久经考验的成就，它驯服了人性中的阴暗面，因此值得我们像对待知识分子和改革家们的措辞严谨的著述一样予以尊重。伯克式的保守主义，其本身就是理性的优美应用，它代表了对启蒙运动的小修正。但是，约翰·格特弗里德·冯·赫尔德的浪漫民族主义，让反启蒙运动思想极度膨胀，他的观点是，一个民族集团——在赫尔德这里，就是日耳曼人民——有着非同寻常的品质，完全不可能被所谓人类的普遍性所涵盖，这个民族的整合不是靠什么理性的社会契约，而是被鲜血和土地紧紧地联结在一起。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Congress of Vienna in 1815, when statesmen from the great powers engineered a system of international relations that would last a century, was a triumph of Burkean conservatism, aiming for stability above all else. Nonetheless, Howard observes, its architects "were as much the heirs of the Enlightenment as had been the French revolutionary leaders. They believed neither in the divine right of kings nor the divine authority of the church; but since church and king were necessary tools in the restoration and maintenance of the domestic order that the revolution had so rudely disturbed, their authority had everywhere to be restored and upheld." More important, "they no longer accepted war between major states as an ineluctable element in the international system. The events of the past twenty-five years had shown that it was too dangerous." The great powers took on the responsibility of preserving peace and order (which they pretty much equated), and their Concert of Europe was a forerunner of the League of Nations, the United Nations, and the European Union. This international Leviathan deserves much of the credit for the long intervals of peace in 19th-century Europe.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在1815年的维也纳会议上，大国的政治家们构造了一种延续了一个世纪的国际关系体系，维也纳会议是伯克保守主义思想的胜利，即稳定压倒一切。尽管如此，霍华德还是观察到，“这个新体系的建筑师们既是启蒙运动的继承人，也是法国革命领袖的追随者。他们既不相信神圣王权，也不相信神圣神权，但如果教会和国王是在革命的狂风暴雨后重建和维护国家秩序的必要工具，那么也只好在各地重整他们的权威了”。更重要的是，“他们不再认为大国之间的战争是国际关系中不可避免的组成部分。以往25年的一系列事件证明，战争实在是过于残酷了”。大国承担起维护和平和秩序的责任，他们组建的“欧洲同盟”（Concert of Europe）可以说是国联、联合国和欧盟的前驱。19世纪的欧洲得以有较长时间的和平间歇，“欧洲同盟”这个国际利维坦功不可没。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">According to Howard, "this dialectic between Enlightenment and Counter-Enlightenment, between the individual and the tribe, was to pervade, and to a large extent shape, the history of Europe throughout the nineteenth century, and of the world the century after that." During those two centuries Burkean conservatism, Enlightenment liberalism, and romantic nationalism played off one another in shifting alliances (and sometimes became strange bedfellows).</div>

<div class="line_en">But the stability was enforced by monarchs who ruled over lumpy amalgams of ethnic groups, which began to clamor for a say in how their affairs were run. The result was a nationalism that, according to Howard, was "based not so much on universal human rights as on the rights of nations to fight their way into existence and to defend themselves once they existed." Peace was not particularly desirable in the short term; it would come about "only when all nations were free. Meanwhile, [nations] claimed the right to use such force as was necessary to free themselves, by fighting precisely the wars of national liberation that the Vienna system had been set up to prevent."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，君主们一边要维持欧洲的稳定，另一边要对付内部的民族纠纷，各个民族开始强烈地要求管理自己的事务。霍华德说：“结果，民族主义与其说是来自于普世的人权，不如说是民族首先为争取生存而战，继而为维护生存而战。”从短期看，对和平的渴望并不是特别强烈，因为很多人得出的结论是“只有当所有的民族都得到自由的时候才会有和平。同时，很多民族宣称有权在必要的时候使用武力争取自由，而‘维也纳同盟’体系正是要力图防止这种民族解放战争”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Nationalist sentiments soon intermixed with every other political movement. Once nation-states emerged, they became the new establishment, which the conservatives strove to conserve. As monarchs became icons of their nations, conservatism and nationalism gradually merged. And among many intellectuals, romantic nationalism became entwined with the Hegelian doctrine that history was an inexorable dialectic of progress. As Luard summarized the doctrine, "All history represents the working out of some divine plan; war is the way that sovereign states, through which that plan manifested itself, must resolve their differences, leading to the emergence of superior states (such as the Prussian state), representing the fulfillment of the divine purpose." Eventually the doctrine spawned the messianic, militant, romantic nationalist movements of fascism and Nazism. A similar construction of history as an unstoppable dialectic of violent liberation, but with classes substituted for nations, became the foundation of 20th-century communism.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="民族主义情感很快融入所有的政治运动。一旦民族国家得以确立，它立即成为新的、为保守派所竭力维护的权势集团。当王室成为民族国家的象征，保守主义和民族主义也就渐渐开始合流。许多知识分子将浪漫民族主义与黑格尔的辩证历史观——历史不可阻挡地向前发展——交织在一起。卢亚德这样总结黑格尔的历史观：“全部的历史都是在执行一个神圣计划。战争是主权国家解决它们之间纠纷的途径，这正是神圣计划宣示自身的过程，主权国家中出现超级国家（比如普鲁士），代表着神圣意志得以实现。”一步接一步地，黑格尔哲学最后孵化出了法西斯主义和纳粹主义。法西斯和纳粹运动具有弥撒亚式的、军国主义的和浪漫民族主义的特质。作为与此相似的另一个历史建构——暴力解放不可阻挡的辩证历史观，成为20世纪共产主义运动的基石。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One might think that the liberal heirs of the British, American, and Kantian Enlightenment would have been opposed to the increasingly militant nationalism. But they found themselves in a pickle: they could hardly defend autocratic monarchies and empires. So liberalism signed on to nationalism in the guise of "self-determination of peoples," which has a vaguely democratic aroma. Unfortunately, the whiff of humanism emanating from that phrase depended on a fatal synecdoche. The term "nation" or "people" came to stand for the individual men, women, and children who made up that nation, and then the political leaders came to stand for the nation. A ruler, a flag, an army, a territory, a language, came to be cognitively equated with millions of fleshand-blood individuals. The liberal doctrine of self-determination of peoples was enshrined by Woodrow Wilson in a 1916 speech and became the basis for the world order after World War I. One of the people who immediately saw the inherent contradiction in the "self-determination of peoples' was Wilson's own secretary of state, Robert Lansing, who wrote in his diary:</div>

One of the dangers of "self-determination" is that there is really no such thing as a "nation" in the sense of an ethnocultural group that coincides with a patch of real estate. Unlike features of a landscape like trees and mountains, people have feet. They move to places where the opportunities are best, and they soon invite their friends and relatives to join them. This demographic mixing turns the landscape into a fractal, with minorities inside minorities inside minorities. A government with sovereignty over a territory which claims to embody a "nation" will in fact fail to embody the interests of many of the individuals living within that territory, while taking a proprietary interest in individuals living in other territories. If utopia is a world in which political boundaries coincide with ethnic boundaries, leaders will be tempted to hasten it along with campaigns of ethnic cleansing and irredentism. Also, in the absence of liberal democracy and a robust commitment to human rights, the synecdoche in which a people is equated with its political ruler will turn any international confederation (such as the General Assembly of the United Nations) into a travesty. Tinpot dictators are welcomed into the family of nations and given carte blanche to starve, imprison, and murder their citizens.</div>

<div class="line_en">Peace, in contrast, was "a dream and not a pleasant one at that," wrote the German military strategist Helmuth von Moltke; "without war, the world would wallow in materialism." Friedrich Nietzsche agreed: "It is mere illusion and pretty sentiment to expect much (even anything at all) from mankind if it forgets how to make war." According to the British historian J. A. Cramb, peace would mean "a world sunk in bovine content… a nightmare which shall be realized only when the ice has crept to the heart of the sun, and the stars, left black and trackless, start from their orbits."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="相反，和平则成为“一种梦想，而且不是一个美妙的梦想”，德国军事战略家赫尔穆特·冯·毛奇（Helmuth von Moltke）说，“如果没有战争，世界就会在物质主义中沉沦。”弗里德里希·尼采（Friedrich Nietzsche）对此表示同意，他说：“如果人类忘记了如何制造战争，他们就只剩下些幻想和漂亮的情感，除此之外还能期待的所余无几（甚至是荡然无存了）。”依照英国历史学家J·A·克拉姆（J. A。 Cramb）的解释，和平的意思是“世界在迟钝之中沉沦…一场噩梦成真，如同太阳变成冰块，留下行星在一片黑暗的空寂中默默地沿着轨道运行”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Even thinkers who opposed war, such as Kant, Adam Smith, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Oliver Wendell Holmes, H. G. Wells, and William James, had nice things to say about it. The title of James's 1906 essay "The Moral Equivalent of War" referred not to something that was as bad as war but to something that would be as good as it. He began, to be sure, by satirizing the military romantic's view of war:</div>

<div class="line_en">But then he conceded that "we must make new energies and hardihoods continue the manliness to which the military mind so faithfully clings. Martial virtues must be the enduring cement; intrepidity, contempt of softness, surrender of private interest, obedience to command, must still remain the rock upon which states are built." And so he proposed a program of compulsory national service in which "our gilded youths [would] be drafted off… to get the childishness knocked out of them" in coal mines, foundries, fishing vessels, and construction sites.</div>

<div class="line_en">Romantic nationalism and romantic militarism fed off each other, particularly in Germany, which came late to the party of European states and felt that it deserved an empire too. In England and France, romantic militarism ensured that the prospect of war was not as terrifying as it should have been. On the contrary, Hillaire Belloc wrote, "How I long for the Great War! It will sweep Europe like a broom!" Paul Valéry felt the same way: "I almost desire a monstrous war." Even Sherlock Holmes got into the act; in 1914 Arthur Conan Doyle had him say, "It will be cold and bitter, Watson, and a good many of us may wither before its blast. But it's God's own wind none the less, and a cleaner, better, stronger land will lie in the sunshine when the storm has cleared." Metaphors proliferated: the sweeping broom, the bracing wind, the pruning shears, the cleansing storm, the purifying fire. Shortly before he joined the British navy, the poet Rupert Brooke wrote:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="浪漫民族主义和浪漫军国主义互为营养，在德国表现得尤为突出。德国是欧洲国家晚宴的迟到者，但自认为也配得上拥有一个帝国。在英国和法国，浪漫军国主义信誓旦旦地说，战争的景象绝不应该是它所显现的那样恐怖。相反，西莱尔·贝洛克（Hillaire Belloc）这样写道：“我多么渴望一场大战！它将像扫帚一样横扫欧洲的污泥浊水！”保罗·瓦莱里（Paul Valéry）心里有着同样的念头：“我几乎在盼望一场毁灭性的战争。”甚至夏洛克·福尔摩斯也忍不住发表了自己的意见。阿瑟·柯南道尔在1914年让福尔摩斯感叹说：“这会是冰冷和苦涩的，华生，在它大爆发之前，我们中间不少人可能就已经枯萎了。但是，说到底这是上帝的狂风，风暴过去后，阳光下会有一片更干净、更美好、更坚实的大地。”各色隐喻不胜枚举：清扫灰尘的扫帚，振奋人心的清风，修枝裁叶的剪刀，荡涤污泥浊水的风暴，还有提纯精练的火焰。英国诗人鲁伯特·布鲁克（Rupert Brooke）写道：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Of course, the swimmers weren't leaping into clean water but wading into blood." So commented the critic Adam Gopnik in a 2004 review of seven new books that were still, almost a century later, trying to figure out exactly how World War I happened. The carnage was stupefying --8.5 million deaths in combat, and perhaps 15 million deaths overall, in just four years. Romantic militarism by itself cannot explain the orgy of slaughter. Writers had been glorifying war at least the since the 18th century, but the post-Napoleonic 19th had had two unprecedented stretches without a great power war. The war was a perfect storm of destructive currents, brought suddenly together by the iron dice of Mars: an ideological background of militarism and nationalism, a sudden contest of honor that threatened the credibility of each of the great powers, a Hobbesian trap that frightened leaders into attacking before they were attacked first, an overconfidence that deluded each of them into thinking that victory would come swiftly, military machines that could deliver massive quantities of men to a front that could mow them down as quickly as they arrived, and a game of attrition that locked the two sides into sinking exponentially greater costs into a ruinous situation -- all set off by a Serbian nationalist who had a lucky day.</div>
