<div class="line_en">The hottest day of the summer so far was drawing to a close and a drowsy silence lay over the large, square houses of Privet Drive. Cars that were usually gleaming stood dusty in their drives and lawns that were once emerald green lay parched and yellowing -- for the use of hosepipes had been banned due to drought. Deprived of their usual car-washing and lawn-mowing pursuits, the inhabitants of Privet Drive had retreated into the shade of their cool houses, windows thrown wide in the hope of tempting in a nonexistent breeze. The only person left outdoors was a teenage boy who was lying flat on his back in a flowerbed outside number four.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="夏季以来最炎热的一天终于快要结束了，女贞路上那些方方正正的大房子笼罩在一片令人昏昏欲睡的寂静中。平日里光亮照人的汽车，这会儿全都灰扑扑地停在车道上，曾经葱翠欲滴的草地，已变得枯黄——由于旱情，浇水软管已被禁止使用。女贞路上的居民，乎常的消遣就是擦车和割草，现在这两件事都做不成了，只好躲进他们阴凉的房子里，把窗户开得大大的，指望能吹进一丝并不存在的凉风。只有一个人还待在户外，这是一个十多岁的男孩，这时他正平躺在女贞路4号外面的花坛里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was a skinny, black-haired, bespectacled boy who had the pinched, slightly unhealthy look of someone who has grown a lot in a short space of time. His jeans were torn and dirty, his T-shirt baggy and faded, and the soles of his trainers were peeling away from the uppers. Harry Potter's appearance did not endear him to the neighbours, who were the sort of people who thought scruffiness ought to be punishable by law, but as he had hidden himself behind a large hydrangea bush this evening he was quite invisible to passers-by. In fact, the only way he would be spotted was if his Uncle Vernon or Aunt Petunia stuck their heads out of the living-room window and looked straight down into the flowerbed below.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他是一个瘦瘦的男孩，黑头发，戴着眼镜，看上去有些赢弱，略带病态，似乎是因为在很短的时间里个头蹿得太快。他身上的牛仔裤又破又脏，T恤衫松松垮垮，已经褪了颜色，运动鞋的鞋底与鞋帮分了家。哈利波特的这副模样，是无法讨得邻居们喜欢的。他们那些人认为，破旧邋遢应该受到法律制裁。不过他这天傍晚藏在一大丛绣球花后面，过路人都不会看见他。实际上，只要他的姨父弗农或姨妈佩妮从起居室的窗户探出脑袋，径直朝下面的花坛里望，他还是有司能被他们看见的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On the whole, Harry thought he was to be congratulated on his idea of hiding here. He was not, perhaps, very comfortable lying on the hot, hard earth but, on the other hand, nobody was glaring at him, grinding their teeth so loudly that he could not hear the news, or shooting nasty questions at him, as had happened every time he had tried sitting down in the living room to watch television with his aunt and uncle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="总的来说，哈利觉得他能想到藏在这里真是值得庆幸。躺在炎热的硬邦邦的泥土上也许并不舒服，但另一方面，这里不会有人狠狠地瞪着他，把牙齿咬得咯咯直响，害得他听不清新闻里讲的是什么，也不会有人连珠炮似的问他一些颊人的问题。每次他想坐在客厅里跟姨妈姨父一块儿看看电视，他们总是搅得他不得安宁。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Dursleys fell silent. Harry listened to a jingle about Fruit "n" Bran breakfast cereal while he watched Mrs. Figg, a batty cat-loving old lady from nearby Wisteria Walk, amble slowly past. She was frowning and muttering to herself. Harry was very pleased he was concealed behind the bush, as Mrs. Figg had recently taken to asking him round for tea whenever she met him in the street. She had rounded the corner and vanished from view before Uncle Vernon's voice floated out of the window again.</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry suppressed a snort with difficulty. The Dursleys really were astonishingly stupid about their son, Dudley. They had swallowed all his dim-witted lies about having tea with a different member of his gang every night of the summer holidays. Harry knew perfectly well that Dudley had not been to tea anywhere; he and his gang spent every evening vandalising the play park, smoking on street corners and throwing stones at passing cars and children. Harry had seen them at it during his evening walks around Little Whinging; he had spent most of the holidays wandering the streets, scavenging newspapers from bins along the way.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Give 'em a lifelong siesta, I would," snarled Uncle Vernon over the end of the newsreader's sentence, but no matter: outside in the flowerbed, Harry's stomach seemed to unclench.

<div class="line_cn" title="“要是我，就让他们终身享受午睡。”新闻广播员的话音刚落，弗农姨父就恶狠狠地吼道，但是没关系，外面花坛里的哈利心里一块石头已经落了地。如果真的发生了什么事，肯定是头条新闻，死亡和灾难远比滞留机场的度假者重要得多。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He let out a long, slow breath and stared up at the brilliant blue sky. Every day this summer had been the same: the tension, the expectation, the temporary relief, and then mounting tension again… and always, growing more insistent all the time, the question of why nothing had happened yet…</div>

<div class="line_en">He kept listening, just in case there was some small clue, not recognised for what it really was by the Muggles -- an unexplained disappearance, perhaps, or some strange accident… but the baggage-handlers' strike was followed by news about the drought in the Southeast ('I hope he's listening next door!" bellowed Uncle Vernon. "Him with his sprinklers on at three in the morning!'), then a helicopter that had almost crashed in a field in Surrey, then a famous actress's divorce from her famous husband ('As if we're interested in their sordid affairs," sniffed Aunt Petunia, who had followed the case obsessively in every magazine she could lay her bony hands on).</div>

<div class="line_en">A loud, echoing crack broke the sleepy silence like a gunshot; a cat streaked out from under a parked car and flew out of sight; a shriek, a bellowed oath and the sound of breaking china came from the Dursleys' living room, and as though this was the signal Harry had been waiting for he jumped to his feet, at the same time pulling from the waistband of his jeans a thin wooden wand as if he were unsheathing a sword -- but before he could draw himself up to full height, the top of his head collided with the Dursleys' open window. The resultant crash made Aunt Petunia scream even louder.</div>

Some invisible force seemed to have surged through his nephew, making him impossible to hold.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“放——开——我！”哈利喘着气说。他们扭打了几秒钟，哈利用左手去掰姨父香肠般粗大的手指，右手还牢牢地握着举起的魔杖。接着，哈利本来就疼痛难忍的头顶猛的一阵钻心的剧痛，弗农姨父大叫一声，就像遭到电击一般，松开了哈利。似乎他外甥体内涌起一股看不见的力量，使他没法抓住他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Well, thought Harry, as he crossed Magnolia Crescent, turned into Magnolia Road and headed towards the darkening play park, he had (by and large) done as Sirius advised. He had at least resisted the temptation to tie his trunk to his broomstick and set off for The Burrow by himself. In fact, Harry thought his behaviour had been very good considering how frustrated and angry he felt at being stuck in Privet Drive so long, reduced to hiding in flowerbeds in the hope of hearing something that might point to what Lord Voldemort was doing. Nevertheless, it was quite galling to be told not to be rash by a man who had served twelve years in the wizard prison, Azkaban, escaped, attempted to commit the murder he had been convicted for in the first place, then gone on the run with a stolen hippogriff…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="是啊，他（基本上）还是照小天狼星的叮嘱去做的，哈利这么想着，一边穿过木兰花新月街，拐进了木兰花路，朝逐渐变得昏暗的游乐场走去。是啊，他至少抵挡住了诱惑，没有索性把箱子绑在飞天扫帚上，直接飞到陋居去。实际上，哈利认为自己的表现一直是非常好的，要知道他被困在女贞路这么长时间，为了能听见一点透露伏地魔所作所为的只言片语，不得不藏在花坛里，这让他感到多么沮丧和生气啊。然而，居然是小天狼星叮嘱他不要鲁莽行事，这真是叫人恼怒。要知道小天狼星自己就是在阿兹卡班巫师监狱里被关了十二年，然后逃出来，试图完成他原先被指控的那个谋杀罪，最后骑着一只偷来的鹰头马身有翼兽逃之天天的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry vaulted over the locked park gate and set off across the parched grass. The park was as empty as the surrounding streets. When he reached the swings he sank on to the only one that Dudley and his friends had not yet managed to break, coiled one arm around the chain and stared moodily at the ground. He would not be able to hide in the Dursleys' flowerbed again. Tomorrow, he would have to think of some fresh way of listening to the news. In the meantime, he had nothing to look forward to but another restless, disturbed night, because even when he escaped the nightmares about Cedric he had unsettling dreams about long dark corridors, all finishing in dead ends and locked doors, which he supposed had something to do with the trapped feeling he had when he was awake. Often the old scar on his forehead prickled uncomfortably, but he did not fool himself that Ron or Hermione or Sirius would find that very interesting any more. In the past, his scar hurting had warned that Voldemort was getting stronger again, but now that Voldemort was back they would probably remind him that its regular irritation was only to be expected… nothing to worry about… old news…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="游乐场的门锁着，哈利一跃而过，踏着于枯的草地往前走去。游乐场里和周围的街道一样空荡荡的。他来到秋千所在的地方，找到一架达力和他那些朋友还没来得及毁坏的秋千坐了上去，一只胳膊挽着铁链，目光忧郁地望着地面。他再也不能藏在德思礼家的花坛里了。明天，他必须想出另外的办法去偷听新闻。与此同时，他没有什么可指望的，摆在他面前的又是一个混乱不安的夜晚。就算他侥幸逃过关于塞德里克的噩梦，他也会梦见一条条漫长而昏暗的走廊，每一条走廊的尽头都是死胡同或紧锁的房门，这些梦境弄得他心神不宁，他猜想这大概和他醒着时产生的困兽般的情绪有关。他额头上的伤疤经常刺痛，很不舒服，但他知道，罗恩、赫敏和小天狼星不会对这件事很感兴趣了。过去，他的伤疤疼痛发作预示着伏地魔的力量正在再次变得强大起来，但现在伏地魔已经回来了，他们大概会提醒他说早就料到会有这种定期发作的疼痛，没什么可担心的，已经不是什么新闻了。">查看中文翻译</div>

And. his reward was to be stuck in Little Whinging for four solid weeks, completely cut off from the magical world, reduced to squatting among dying begonias so hat he could hear about water-skiing budgerigars! How could Dumbledore have forgotten him so easily? Why had Ron and Hermione got together without inviting him along, too? How much longer was he supposed to endure Sirius telling him to sit tight and be a good boy; or resist the temptation to write to the stupid Daily Prophet and point out that Voldemort had returned?

<div class="line_cn" title="可是他内心已经没有丝毫喜悦，摄魂怪冰冷的手指就要掐住他的喉咙了——那尖厉、刺耳的笑声越来越响，他的脑海里有一个声音在说：“朝死亡屈服吧，哈利，甚至不会有任何痛苦…我不会知道…我从来没有死过…”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">An enormous silver stag erupted from the tip of Harry's wand; it's antlers caught the Dementor in the place where the heart should have been; it was thrown backwards, weightless as darkness, and as the stag charged, the Dementor swooped away, bat-like and defeated.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一头巨大的银色牡鹿从哈利的魔杖头上喷了出来，两根鹿角直刺向摄魂怪的心脏所在的地方。摄魂怪被撞得连连后退，像周围的黑暗一样没有重量。牡鹿冲上前去，摄魂怪像蝙蝠一样扑闪到一边，匆匆逃走了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"THIS WAY!" Harry shouted at the stag. Wheeling around, he sprinted down the alleyway, holding the lit wand aloft. "DUDLEY? DUDLEY!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这边！”哈利朝牡鹿喊道。他转身拔腿在小巷里奔跑，手里高高举着点亮的魔杖。“达力？达力！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He had run barely a dozen steps when he reached them: Dudley was curled up on the ground, his arms clamped over his face. A second Dementor was crouching low over him, gripping his wrists in its slimy hands, prising them slowly, almost lovingly apart, lowering its hooded head towards Dudley's face as though about to kiss him…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他跑了十几步就赶到了他们跟前。达力蜷缩在地上，两只胳膊死死地护着脸。第二个摄魂怪正矮身蹲在他身边，用两只黏糊糊的手抓住达力的手腕，几乎很温柔地把两只胳膊慢慢地掰开了，那颗戴兜帽的脑袋朝达力的脸垂下去，似乎要去亲吻他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"GET IT!" Harry bellowed, and with a rushing, roaring sound, the silver stag he had conjured came galloping past him. The Dementor's eyeless face was barely an inch from Dudley's when the silver antlers caught it; the thing was thrown up into the air and, like its fellow, it soared away and was absorbed into the darkness; the stag cantered to the end of the alleyway and dissolved into silver mist.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“抓住它！”哈利喊道，随着一阵快速的呼啸声，他变出来的那头银色牡鹿从他的身边跑过。摄魂怪那没有眼睛的脸离达力的脸只差不到一英寸了，说时迟那时快，银色的鹿角刺中了它，把它挑起来抛到半空。它像刚才它的那个同伴一样，腾空逃走，被黑暗吞没了。牡鹿慢跑到小巷尽头，化为一股银色烟雾消失了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Moon, stars and streetlamps burst back into life. A warm breeze swept the alleyway. Trees rustled in neighbouring gardens and the mundane rumble of cars in Magnolia Crescent filled the air again.</div>
