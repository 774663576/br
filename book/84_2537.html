<div class="line_en">I wanted to get away from the junkyard and there was only one way to do that, which was the way Audrey had done it: by getting a job so I wouldn't be at the house when Dad rounded up his crew. The trouble was, I was eleven.</div>

<div class="line_en">I biked a mile into the dusty center of our little village. There wasn't much there, just a church, a post office and a gas station called Papa Jay's. I went into the post office. Behind the counter was an older lady whose name I knew was Myrna Moyle, because Myrna and her husband Jay (Papa Jay) owned the gas station. Dad said they'd been behind the city ordinance limiting dog ownership to two dogs per family. They'd proposed other ordinances, too, and now every Sunday Dad came home from church shouting about Myrna and Jay Moyle, and how they were from Monterey or Seattle or wherever and thought they could impose West Coast socialism on the good people of Idaho.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mary taught nursing at the school, which Dad said was just about as brainwashed as a person could get, to be working for the Medical Establishment and the Government both. I thought maybe he wouldn't let me work for her, but he did, and pretty soon I was babysitting Mary's daughter every Monday, Wednesday and Friday morning. Then Mary had a friend, Eve, who needed a babysitter for her three children on Tuesdays and Thursdays.</div>

<div class="line_en">The next day, when Mary returned from the school, I asked her if instead of money she would give me lessons. We perched on the piano bench and she showed me a few finger exercises. Then she asked what else I was learning besides the piano. Dad had told me what to say when people asked about my schooling. "I do school every day," I said.</div>

I didn't know what that meant until one Sunday when Mary played a piano solo for the congregation. The music stopped my breath. I'd heard the piano played countless times before, to accompany hymns, but when Mary played it, the sound was nothing like that formless clunking. It was liquid, it was air. It was rock one moment and wind the next.</div>

<div class="line_en">That Wednesday, I wore the leotard and tights with my gray T-shirt over the top. The T-shirt reached almost to my knees, but even so I was ashamed to see so much of my legs. Dad said a righteous woman never shows anything above her ankle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那个周三，我穿着紧身连衣裤、紧身裤袜，外面套着那件灰色T恤。T恤几乎遮住了我的膝盖，即便如此，我也为露出腿而感到羞愧。爸爸说过，正派的女人永远都不能露出脚踝以上的任何部位。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A few days later, Mother drove me forty miles to a small shop whose shelves were lined with exotic shoes and strange acrylic costumes. Not one was modest. Mother went straight to the counter and told the attendant we needed a black leotard, white tights and jazz shoes.</div>

<div class="line_en">The other girls rarely spoke to me, but I loved being there with them. I loved the sensation of conformity. Learning to dance felt like learning to belong. I could memorize the movements and, in doing so, step into their minds, lunging when they lunged, reaching my arms upward in time with theirs. Sometimes, when I glanced at the mirror and saw the tangle of our twirling forms, I couldn't immediately discern myself in the crowd. It didn't matter that I was wearing a gray T-shirt -- a goose among swans. We moved together, a single flock.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其他女孩很少和我说话，但我喜欢和她们在一起。我喜欢保持一致的感觉。学跳舞就像在学习有所归属。我能记住动作，做这些动作时，我能进入她们的大脑，与她们一同呼吸，一齐伸出双臂。有时我瞥一眼镜子，看见我们聚成团快速旋转的身体，无法立刻在人群中认出自己。身穿灰色T恤的我虽然像天鹅群中的一只家鹅，但这不重要。重要的是我们是一个群体，共同行动。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On the Wednesday after Caroline called Mother, I arrived at Papa Jay's a few minutes early. The younger class had just finished, and the store was flooded with six-year-olds, prancing for their mothers in red velvet hats and skirts sparkling with sequins of deep scarlet. I watched them wiggle and leap through the aisles, their thin legs covered only by sheer tights. I thought they looked like tiny harlots.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在卡洛琳打电话给母亲后的星期三，我提前几分钟到了杰伊老爹加油站。小班刚下课，到处是六岁左右的小女孩，头戴红色天鹅绒帽，裙子上闪烁着深红色亮片，欢蹦乱跳地找她们的母亲。我看着她们扭动着腰肢，蹦蹦跳跳地穿过走廊，纤细的腿上只穿着透明紧身连裤袜。我觉得她们看上去像小妓女。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The rest of my class arrived. When they saw the outfits, they rushed into the studio to see what Caroline had for them. Caroline was standing next to a cardboard box full of large gray sweatshirts. She began handing them out. "Here are your costumes!" she said. The girls held up their sweatshirts, eyebrows raised in disbelief. They had expected chiffon or ribbon, not Fruit of the Loom. Caroline had tried to make the sweatshirts more appealing by sewing large Santas, bordered with glitter, on the fronts, but this only made the dingy cotton seem dingier.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="班里的其他同学陆续来了。她们看到这些服装，立刻冲进工作室，想看看卡洛琳为她们准备了什么样的服装。卡洛琳站在一个纸箱旁，箱子里装满了宽大的灰色运动衫。她开始分发。“这就是你们的服装！”她说。女孩们举起运动衫，扬起眉毛，难以置信。她们期待的是雪纺或缎带，而不是鲜果布衣[10]。为了让运动衫漂亮一些，卡洛琳在胸前缝上了镶有亮边的硕大的圣诞老人，但这只是让脏兮兮的棉布显得更脏。【注：[10]Fruit of the Loom，美国内衣品牌，也生产T恤。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We began rehearsals for the Christmas recital, and Caroline called Mother to discuss the costume. "The skirt will be how long?" Mother said. "And sheer? No, that's not going to work." I heard Caroline say something about what the other girls in the class would want to wear. "Tara can't wear that," Mother said. "If that's what the other girls are wearing, she will stay home."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们开始为圣诞演奏会进行排练，卡洛琳打电话给母亲讨论服装的事。“裙子有多长？”母亲说，“透明吗？不，这可不行。”我听见卡洛琳谈起舞蹈班里的其他女孩想穿什么。“塔拉不能穿那个。”母亲说，“如果别的女孩就要穿成那样，她就待在家里不去了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The recital was held at the church. Everyone was there, with flashing cameras and bulky camcorders. I changed into my costume in the same room where I attended Sunday school. The other girls chatted cheerfully; I pulled on my sweatshirt, trying to stretch the material a few more inches. I was still tugging it downward when we lined up on the stage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="演奏会在教堂举行。所有人都来了，照相机不停闪烁，大大的摄像机红灯亮起。我在一间房里换上表演服（我也在那里上主日学校的课程）。别的女孩在开心地聊天；我套上运动衫，使劲把布料往下拉了几英寸。我们在舞台上排好队时，我还在往下拽衣服。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mother hadn't told Dad about the recital, and neither had I. I didn't ask him to come. There was an instinct at work in me, a learned intuition. The day of the recital, Mother told Dad I had a "thing" that night. Dad asked a lot of questions, which surprised Mother, and after a few minutes she admitted it was a dance recital. Dad grimaced when Mother told him I'd been taking lessons from Caroline Moyle, and I thought he was going to start talking about California socialism again, but he didn't. Instead he got his coat and the three of us walked to the car.</div>

<div class="line_en">Music played from a stereo on the piano and we began to dance, our feet tapping in sequence. Next we were supposed to leap, reach upward and spin. My feet remained planted. Instead of flinging my arms above my head, I lifted them only to my shoulders.

<div class="line_en">The rest of the night was taken up by my father's lecture. He said Caroline's class was one of Satan's deceptions, like the public school, because it claimed to be one thing when really it was another. It claimed to teach dance, but instead it taught immodesty, promiscuity. Satan was shrewd, Dad said. By calling it "dance," he had convinced good Mormons to accept the sight of their daughters jumping about like whores in the Lord's house. That fact offended Dad more than anything else: that such a lewd display had taken place in a church.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mother must have felt guilty after the recital, because in the weeks that followed she searched for something else I could do, something Dad wouldn't forbid. She'd noticed the hours I spent in my room with Tyler's old boom box, listening to the Mormon Tabernacle Choir, so she began looking for a voice teacher. It took a few weeks to find one, and another few weeks to persuade the teacher to take me. The lessons were much more expensive than the dance class had been, but Mother paid for them with the money she made selling oils.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在演奏会后，母亲一定是颇感内疚，因为接下来的几个星期，她努力寻找其他我能做的而父亲也不会禁止的事。她注意到我经常用泰勒的旧音箱听摩门教礼拜合唱团的音乐，于是开始给我找声乐老师。几周后老师找到了，她又花了几周时间说服那位老师教我。这些课程比舞蹈课贵多了，但是母亲用卖精油赚来的钱付了学费。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After a few lessons, she announced that I was ready to sing in church. It was arranged, she said. I would sing a hymn in front of the congregation that Sunday.</div>

<div class="line_en">The teacher was tall and thin, with long fingernails that clicked as they flew across the piano keys. She straightened my posture by pulling the hair at the base of my neck until I'd tucked in my chin, then she stretched me out on the floor and stepped on my stomach to strengthen my diaphragm. She was obsessed with balance and often slapped my knees to remind me to stand powerfully, to take up my own space.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="老师又高又瘦，修长的指甲掠过钢琴琴键时叮当作响。她先纠正我的仪态，拉着我脖后根的头发，让我收紧下巴，然后在地板上给我拉伸，踩我的肚子以加强横膈膜的力量。她非常重视平衡，经常拍打我的膝盖，提醒我站立时要挺拔有力。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The days slipped away quickly, as days do when you're dreading something. On Sunday morning, I stood at the pulpit and stared into the faces of the people below. There was Myrna and Papa Jay, and behind them Mary and Caroline. They looked sorry for me, like they thought I might humiliate myself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="日子过得很快，你越害怕某事，时间流逝得越快。周日早上，我站在布道台前，盯着下面人们的脸。有默娜和杰伊老爹，他们后面是玛丽和卡洛琳。他们看上去为我难过，似乎觉得我会出洋相。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mother played the introduction. The music paused; it was time to sing. I might have had any number of thoughts at that moment. I might have thought of my teacher and her techniques -- square stance, straight back, dropped jaw. Instead I thought of Tyler, and of lying on the carpet next to his desk, staring at his woolen-socked feet while the Mormon Tabernacle Choir chanted and trilled. He'd filled my head with their voices, which to me were more beautiful than anything except Buck's Peak.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="母亲弹了序曲部分，音乐暂停，轮到我唱了。那一刻我本该思绪万千。也许我本该记起我的老师和她教授的技巧——挺胸抬头，腰背挺直，下巴收紧。可是我却想起了泰勒，想起我躺在他书桌旁的地毯上，盯着他穿着羊毛袜子的脚，聆听摩门教礼拜合唱团用颤音高歌的情景。他让我的脑海充满了合唱的声音，对我来说，这声音美妙至极，世上除了巴克峰，再没有什么能与之相媲美。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mother's fingers hovered over the keys. The pause had become awkward; the congregation shifted uncomfortably. I thought of the voices, of their strange contradictions -- of the way they made sound float on air, of how that sound was soft like a warm wind, but so sharp it pierced. I reached for those voices, reached into my mind -- and there they were. Nothing had ever felt so natural; it was as if I thought the sound, and by thinking it brought it into being. But reality had never yielded to my thoughts before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="母亲的手指悬停在琴键上。这个停顿变得尴尬；教堂会众不自在地动了动。我想起那些声音，想起它们充满奇异的矛盾——想起它们使音符那样飘浮在空气之上，像暖风一样柔软，但又如此尖锐有力。我去内心深处寻求那些声音——它们就在那里。一切感觉那么自然，就好像我想出了那些声音，我用想的方式唱出了它们。但之前现实从未曾屈服于我的想法。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dad smiled at everyone. There was scarcely a person in the church that Dad hadn't called a gentile -- for visiting a doctor or for sending their kids to the public school -- but that day he seemed to forget about California socialism and the Illuminati. He stood next to me, a hand on my shoulder, graciously collecting compliments. "We're very blessed," he kept saying. "Very blessed." Papa Jay crossed the chapel and paused in front of our pew. He said I sang like one of God's own angels. Dad looked at him for a moment, then his eyes began to shine and he shook Papa Jay's hand like they were old friends.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爸爸朝每个人微笑。因为看医生或者送孩子上学的问题，教堂里几乎所有人之前都被爸爸称为“异教徒”，但那天他似乎把加州左派和光明会抛诸脑后。他站在我旁边，一只手搭在我肩膀上，亲切地回应人们的赞美之词。“我们受神眷顾，”他不停地说，“非常有福。”杰伊老爹穿过教堂，在我们的座位前停下。他说我唱起歌来就像上帝的天使。爸爸看了他一会儿，然后眼睛发亮，紧握杰伊老爹的手，就像两人是多年的老朋友。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The song finished and I returned to our pew. A prayer was offered to close the service, then the crowd rushed me. Women in floral prints smiled and clasped my hand, men in square black suits clapped my shoulder. The choir director invited me to join the choir, Brother Davis asked me to sing for the Rotary Club, and the bishop -- the Mormon equivalent of a pastor -- said he'd like me to sing my song at a funeral. I said yes to all of them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="歌唱完了，我回到座位上。最后是祈祷仪式，之后人们朝我涌来。穿碎花裙子的女人微笑着和我握手，穿方格黑西装的男人过来拍拍我的肩膀。合唱团主管邀请我加入唱诗班，戴维斯兄弟请我为扶轮社[11]唱歌，主教——在摩门教中相当于牧师——说，他想请我在一场葬礼上唱歌。我答应了所有人的请求。【注：[11]Rotary Club，职业人士的国际性组织，提供慈善服务，鼓励崇高的职业道德，并致力于世界亲善及和平。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I'd never seen this side of my father, but I would see it many times after -- every time I sang. However long he'd worked in the junkyard, he was never too tired to drive across the valley to hear me. However bitter his feelings toward socialists like Papa Jay, they were never so bitter that, should those people praise my voice, Dad wouldn't put aside the great battle he was fighting against the Illuminati long enough to say, "Yes, God has blessed us, we're very blessed." It was as if, when I sang, Dad forgot for a moment that the world was a frightening place, that it would corrupt me, that I should be kept safe, sheltered, at home. He wanted my voice to be heard.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我从未见过父亲的这一面，但之后又见了许多次——每次都是在我唱歌后。不管他在废料场工作了多久，不管他有多累，他都会开车翻山越岭去听我唱歌。不管他多么痛恨像杰伊老爹那样的人，只要那些人赞扬我的声音，爸爸就会把他与光明会的战斗搁置一边，不再充满仇恨，他说：“是的，上帝保佑我们，我们非常有福。”就好像我唱歌时，爸爸一时忘记了世界是一个可怕的地方，它会使我堕落，忘记了我应该待在家里受到庇护。他想让人听见我的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The theater in town was putting on a play, Annie, and my teacher said that if the director heard me sing, he would give me the lead. Mother warned me not to get my hopes up.
