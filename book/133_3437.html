<div class="line_en">That's why you did it. You wanted your world to collapse around you. You wanted everything to get as dark as possible. And Bryce, you knew, could help you do that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这才是理由。你想让自己的世界在你身边垮掉。你想让所有的一切变得漆黑一团。而你知道，布莱斯能帮你做到这点。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Now there was a coincidence. She's the one who used me as a chauffer to attend a party. And there I was, crashing her after-party.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="真是无巧不成书。正是利用我给她当司机去参加聚会的那位。现在我来了，破坏她的派对余兴。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He said you were all just relaxing a bit. Then you, Courtney, offered to give me a ride home when we were done, not realizing "home" was only two houses away. And you sounded so genuine, which surprised me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他说你俩就是在休息。接着，你，考特妮，主动提出等会送我家，都忘了“家”只隔着两幢房子。你说得那么真诚，我都吃惊了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I walked across the wet grass and pulled a latch on the fence, popping the gate open a few inches. And behind it, the source of the steam… a redwood hot tub.</div>
