<div class="line_en">He said nothing. He took opium. The children said he had stained his beard yellow with it. Perhaps. What was obvious to her was that the poor man was unhappy, came to them every year as an escape; and yet every year she felt the same thing; he did not trust her. She said, "I am going to the town. Shall I get you stamps, paper, tobacco?" and she felt him wince. He did not trust her. It was his wife's doing. She remembered that iniquity of his wife's towards him, which had made her turn to steel and adamant there, in the horrible little room in St John's Wood, when with her own eyes she had seen that odious woman turn him out of the house. He was unkempt; he dropped things on his coat; he had the tiresomeness of an old man with nothing in the world to do; and she turned him out of the room. She said, in her odious way, "Now, Mrs Ramsay and I want to have a little talk together," and Mrs Ramsay could see, as if before her eyes, the innumerable miseries of his life. Had he money enough to buy tobacco? Did he have to ask her for it? half a crown? eighteenpence? Oh, she could not bear to think of the little indignities she made him suffer. And always now (why, she could not guess, except that it came probably from that woman somehow) he shrank from her. He never told her anything. But what more could she have done? There was a sunny room given up to him. The children were good to him. Never did she show a sign of not wanting him. She went out of her way indeed to be friendly. Do you want stamps, do you want tobacco? Here's a book you might like and so on. And after all -- after all (here insensibly she drew herself together, physically, the sense of her own beauty becoming, as it did so seldom, present to her) after all, she had not generally any difficulty in making people like her; for instance, George Manning; Mr Wallace; famous as they were, they would come to her of an evening, quietly, and talk alone over her fire. She bore about with her, she could not help knowing it, the torch of her beauty; she carried it erect into any room that she entered; and after all, veil it as she might, and shrink from the monotony of bearing that it imposed on her, her beauty was apparent. She had been admired. She had been loved. She had entered rooms where mourners sat. Tears had flown in her presence. Men, and women too, letting go to the multiplicity of things, had allowed themselves with her the relief of simplicity. It injured her that he should shrink. It hurt her. And yet not cleanly, not rightly. That was what she minded, coming as it did on top of her discontent with her husband; the sense she had now when Mr Carmichael shuffled past, just nodding to her question, with a book beneath his arm, in his yellow slippers, that she was suspected; and that all this desire of hers to give, to help, was vanity. For her own self-satisfaction was it that she wished so instinctively to help, to give, that people might say of her, "O Mrs Ramsay! dear Mrs Ramsay… Mrs Ramsay, of course!" and need her and send for her and admire her? Was it not secretly this that she wanted, and therefore when Mr Carmichael shrank away from her, as he did at this moment, making off to some corner where he did acrostics endlessly, she did not feel merely snubbed back in her instinct, but made aware of the pettiness of some part of her, and of human relations, how flawed they are, how despicable, how self-seeking, at their best. Shabby and worn out, and not presumably (her cheeks were hollow, her hair was white) any longer a sight that filled the eyes with joy, she had better devote her mind to the story of the Fisherman and his Wife and so pacify that bundle of sensitiveness (none of her children was as sensitive as he was), her son James.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mrs Ramsay could have wished that her husband had not chosen that moment to stop. Why had he not gone as he said to watch the children playing cricket? But he did not speak; he looked; he nodded; he approved; he went on. He slipped, seeing before him that hedge which had over and over again rounded some pause, signified some conclusion, seeing his wife and child, seeing again the urns with the trailing of red geraniums which had so often decorated processes of thought, and bore, written up among their leaves, as if they were scraps of paper on which one scribbles notes in the rush of reading -- he slipped, seeing all this, smoothly into speculation suggested by an article in THE TIMES about the number of Americans who visit Shakespeare's house every year. If Shakespeare had never existed, he asked, would the world have differed much from what it is today? Does the progress of civilization depend upon great men? Is the lot of the average human being better now than in the time of the Pharaohs? Is the lot of the average human being, however, he asked himself, the criterion by which we judge the measure of civilization? Possibly not. Possibly the greatest good requires the existence of a slave class. The liftman in the Tube is an eternal necessity. The thought was distasteful to him. He tossed his head. To avoid it, he would find some way of snubbing the predominance of the arts. He would argue that the world exists for the average human being; that the arts are merely a decoration imposed on the top of human life; they do not express it. Nor is Shakespeare necessary to it. Not knowing precisely why it was that he wanted to disparage Shakespeare and come to the rescue of the man who stands eternally in the door of the lift, he picked a leaf sharply from the hedge. All this would have to be dished up for the young men at Cardiff next month, he thought; here, on his terrace, he was merely foraging and picnicking (he threw away the leaf that he had picked so peevishly) like a man who reaches from his horse to pick a bunch of roses, or stuffs his pockets with nuts as he ambles at his ease through the lanes and fields of a country known to him from boyhood. It was all familiar; this turning, that stile, that cut across the fields. Hours he would spend thus, with his pipe, of an evening, thinking up and down and in and out of the old familiar lanes and commons, which were all stuck about with the history of that campaign there, the life of this statesman here, with poems and with anecdotes, with figures too, this thinker, that soldier; all very brisk and clear; but at length the lane, the field, the common, the fruitful nut-tree and the flowering hedge led him on to that further turn of the road where he dismounted always, tied his horse to a tree, and proceeded on foot alone. He reached the edge of the lawn and looked out on the bay beneath.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拉姆齐夫人真希望她的丈夫没有选择这个时候停下来。他为什么没有如他所说去看孩子们打板球？但是他没有说话；他看了看；他点点头；他称赞；他继续往前走。他的思想滑了开去，看到面前那一次又一次使他停顿下来的树篱，象征着某种结论；看到他的妻子和孩子，又—次看到那些垂着红色天竺葵的石瓮，这些花经常点缀他的思想进程，并在叶片上把它们记载下来，好像叶子就是张张纸片，人们在匆忙阅读时在上面草草写下笔记——他的思想滑了开去，看到这一切，《泰晤士报》上的一篇关于每年参观莎士比亚故居的美国人的数目的文章使他平静地陷入了沉思。他自问，如果莎士比亚从来没有存在过，那个世界会和今天的世界有很大的不同吗？文明的进步取决于伟人吗？是否今天普通人的命运比古埃及法老时代的人要好一些？然而，普通人的命运，他自问道，是否就是我们判断文明程度的标准呢？也许不是。也许最伟大的优秀事物的存在需要一个奴隶阶级的存在。伦敦地铁里的电梯工就是个永恒的需要。这个念头令他不快。他把头猛地往后一仰。为了摆脱它，他得找到一个办法来压制艺术的优越地位。他要证明，世界是为普通人存在的；艺术只不过是一种强加在人类生活之上的装饰；艺术并不表现生活的本质；对于人类生活来说，莎士比亚也并不是不可缺少的。他不明白究竟为了什么他要贬低莎士比亚，去挽救永远站在电梯门口的工人。他猛地从树篱上摘下一片叶子。这一切都得在下个月在加的夫的年轻人面前好好阐述一番，他想：在这儿，在他的阶地上，他只不过在随意搜索，轻松品尝（他扔掉了刚才气冲冲地摘下的叶子），就像一个人骑着马缓缓行走在从童年时起就熟知的乡间小路和田野上，从马背上弯身摘一束玫瑰，或采下坚果塞满口袋。一切都是熟悉的，这儿一个拐弯，那儿一个篱墙边的阶梯，那条穿过田间的近路。傍晚他常常一连几个小时就这样度过，抽着烟斗，思路沿着那古老而熟悉的小路和公地上上下下、进进出出，在这些地方。不是那儿留有那场战役的历史，就是这儿留有这个政治家的生平，还有诗歌和软事，而且还有图像，这个思想家，那个军事家；一切都非常生动清晰；但是最后那小路、田野，公地，结着果实的坚果树和开满鲜花的树篱把他带到了路的下一个拐弯处，他总是在那儿下马，把马拴在一棵树上，然后独自徒步前行。他走到草坪的边缘，俯瞰下面的海湾。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was his fate, his peculiarity, whether he wished it or not, to come out thus on a spit of land which the sea is slowly eating away, and there to stand, like a desolate sea-bird, alone. It was his power, his gift, suddenly to shed all superfluities, to shrink and diminish so that he looked barer and felt sparer, even physically, yet lost none of his intensity of mind, and so to stand on his little ledge facing the dark of human ignorance, how we know nothing and the sea eats away the ground we stand on -- that was his fate, his gift. But having thrown away, when he dismounted, all gestures and fripperies, all trophies of nuts and roses, and shrunk so that not only fame kept even in that desolation a vigilance which spared no phantom and luxuriated in no vision, and it was in this guise that he inspired in William Bankes (intermittently) and in Charles Tansley (obsequiously) and in his wife now, when she looked up and saw him standing at the edge of the lawn, profoundly, reverence, and pity, and gratitude too, as a stake driven into the bed of a channel upon which the gulls perch and the waves beat inspires in merry boat-loads a feeling of gratitude for the duty it is taking upon itself of marking the channel out there in the floods alone.</div>

<div class="line_en">"But the father of eight children has no choice." Muttering half aloud, so he broke off, turned, sighed, raised his eyes, sought the figure of his wife reading stories to his little boy, filled his pipe. He turned from the sight of human ignorance and human fate and the sea eating the ground we stand on, which, had he been able to contemplate it fixedly might have led to something; and found consolation in trifles so slight compared with the august theme just now before him that he was disposed to slur that comfort over, to deprecate it, as if to be caught happy in a world of misery was for an honest man the most despicable of crimes. It was true; he was for the most part happy; he had his wife; he had his children; he had promised in six weeks' time to talk "some nonsense" to the young men of Cardiff about Locke, Hume, Berkeley, and the causes of the French Revolution. But this and his pleasure in it, his glory in the phrases he made, in the ardour of youth, in his wife's beauty, in the tributes that reached him from Swansea, Cardiff, Exeter, Southampton, Kidderminster, Oxford, Cambridge -- all had to be deprecated and concealed under the phrase "talking nonsense," because, in effect, he had not done the thing he might have done. It was a disguise; it was the refuge of a man afraid to own his own feelings, who could not say, This is what I like -- this is what I am; and rather pitiable anddistasteful to William Bankes and Lily Briscoe, who wondered why such concealments should be necessary; why he needed always praise; why so brave a man in thought should be so timid in life; how strangely he was venerable and laughable at one and the same time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但是八个孩子的父亲没有别的选择……”他低声咕哝道，于是他猛然打断了思绪，转过身子，叹了口气，抬起眼睛寻找给小儿子念故事的妻子的身影；他装上了烟斗。他转过身来，不再去注意人类的蒙昧无知和人类的命运和大海侵蚀我们脚下的土地，如果他执着地思考这一切的话，他本来是可能会有所发现的；但他却从与他刚才面对的庄严主题相比如此微不足道的琐事上寻求安慰，使他颇想将此种安慰看得无足轻重，不屑一顾，仿佛对于一个诚实可敬的男人来说，被发现在一个苦难的世界上感到幸福是件最为卑鄙的罪行；不错；总的说来他是幸福的；他有妻子；他有儿女；他已经答应六周后给加的夫的年轻人就洛克、休谟、贝克莱等哲学家及法国大革命的起因等“讲几句废话”。但是这一切以及他从中得到的乐趣，从他的警句中；从青年人的热情中；从他妻于的美貌；以及他从斯旺西、加的夫、艾克赛德、南安普顿、基德明斯特、牛津、剑桥等大学给予他的赞美中所获得的乐趣——一日都不得不用“讲几句废话”一语加以掩饰和贬低，因为，实际上，他并没有去做他本可能做的事情。这是个伪装；是一个害怕承认自己感情的人的避难所，这个人不能说，这是我所喜欢的——我就是这样的人；这一点对于威廉·班克斯和莉莉·布里斯柯来说是既可怜又可厌，他们不明白为什么他需要这样掩饰；为什么他总需要赞扬；为什么一个在思想上如此大胆的人在生活上却如此怯弱；他可敬而同时却又可笑，这是多么奇怪的事。">查看中文翻译</div>
