<div class="line_en">The classroom floor had become springily mossy and trees were growing out of it; their leafy branches fanned across the ceiling and windows, so that the room was full of slanting shafts of soft, dappled, green light. The students who had already arrived were sitting on the earthy floor with their backs resting against tree trunks or boulders, arms wrapped around their knees or folded tightly across their chests, and all looking rather nervous. In the middle of the clearing, where there were no trees, stood Firenze.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="教室的地板变成了满地绵软的苔藓，树木就是从它下面长出来的；它们的枝条长满繁茂的树叶，成扇形从天花板和窗户上横贯而过，于是一束束柔和、斑驳的绿色光线倾泻在整间屋子里。先到的学生们背靠树干或大石头坐在泥地上，有的用胳膊搂着膝盖，有的两臂紧紧交叉在胸前，都显得挺紧张。费伦泽就站在没有树木的空地中央。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Er -- hi," said Harry, shaking hands with the centaur, who surveyed him unblinkingly through those astonishingly blue eyes but did not smile. "Er -- good to see you,"</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="哈利想起将近四年前，马人贝恩朝费伦泽大声嚷嚷的情形，那是因为费伦泽允许哈利骑在自己背上，好把他驮到安全的地方；当时贝恩说费伦泽是头“普通的骡子”。哈利怀疑可能就是贝恩当胸踢了费伦泽一蹄子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was the most unusual lesson Harry had ever attended. They did indeed burn sage and mallowsweet there on the classroom floor, and Firenze told them to look for certain shapes and symbols in the pungent fumes, but he seemed perfectly unconcerned that not one of them could see any of the signs he described, telling them that humans were hardly ever good at this, that it took centaurs years and years to become competent, and finished by telling them that it was foolish to put too much faith in such things, anyway, because even centaurs sometimes read them wrongly. He was nothing like any human teacher Harry had ever had. His priority did not seem to be to teach them what he knew, but rather to impress upon them that nothing, not even centaurs' knowledge, was foolproof.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利从来没上过这么奇特的课。他们居然真的在教室地板上点燃了鼠尾草和香锦葵，费伦泽要求他们观察呛人的烟雾，从中找出某些形状和征象，虽然谁都看不出他描述的那些迹象，可他好像一点也不在乎。他对他们说，人类向来不怎么擅长做这种事，就连马人都是经过漫长的岁月才拥有了这种能力。最后他还告诉他们，反正有时连马人都会看走眼，所以过于相信这一类事物是很愚蠢的。他和哈利见过的人类老师没有一点相似之处。他优先考虑的好像并不是把自己的学识传授给他们，而是让他们牢牢记住，没有任何事物是万无一失的，即便是马人的学问也不例外。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He's not very definite on anything, is he?" said Ron in a low voice, as they put out their mallowsweet fire. "I mean, I could do with a few more details about this war we're about to have, couldn't you?"</div>
