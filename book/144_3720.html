<div class="line_cn" title="斯基比·迪尔冲他笑了笑。“没问题，”他说，“这片子导演是洛伦佐·塔卢福。他要求他的人要坐头等舱；配角和跑龙套之所以能在剧本里，是因为他们勾搭上那些明星；游艇要租两周，因为洛伦佐想要坐游艇去参加戛纳电影节。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Hollywood funeral of Eli Marrion was more newsworthy than even that of a Bankable Star. He had been revered by studio heads, producers, and agents, he had even been respected and sometimes loved by Bankable Stars, directors, and even screenplay writers. What had inspired this was his civility and an overpowering intelligence that had solved many problems in the movie business. He also had had the reputation of being fair, within reason.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在好莱坞，伊莱·马林的葬礼甚至比一线红星的葬礼更有报道价值。他德高望重，在电影公司的高层、制片人、经纪人、红演员、导演甚至是电影编剧中间，没谁不尊敬他，而且不少明星、导演和编剧还喜欢他。他能有这样的地位，因为他彬彬有礼、老谋深算，给电影行业解决了不少问题。而且他还是个公正讲理的人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In his later years, he was an ascetic, did not wallow in power, did not command sexual favors from starlets. Also, LoddStone had made more great movies than any other studio, and there was nothing more precious to people who actually made movies.</div>

<div class="line_en">The eulogies began. First a male Bankable Star, then a female Bankable Star, then an A director; even a writer, Benny Sly, gave Marrion tribute. Then the president's chief of staff. Then, just so the show would not be judged pretentious, two of the movie's greatest comics made jokes about Eli Marrion's power and business acumen. Finally, Eli's son, Kevin, and his daughter, Dora, and Bobby Bantz.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="仪式开始。致悼词的先是一名当红男星，然后是位当红女星，接着是一位主流大制作的导演，甚至编剧宾尼·斯莱都为马林献上了哀思。幕僚长讲完后，为了使场面看上去不至于太假惺惺，电影界两名最伟大的滑稽演员讲了几个笑话，都是关于伊莱·马林的权力和商业嗅觉的。最后是伊莱的儿子凯文、女儿朵拉，以及鲍比·邦茨。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She got her laugh and it was Bobby Bantz's turn. Secretly he resented Dora's joke. "I spent thirty years building LoddStone Studios with Eli Marrion," he said. "He was the most intelligent, the kindest man I have ever known. Under him, my service of thirty years has been the happiest time of my life. And I will continue to serve his dream. He showed his faith in me by leaving me in control of the Studio for the next five years and I will not fail him. I cannot hope to equal Eli's achievements. He gave dreams to billions of people all over the world. He shared his wealth and love with his family and all the people of America. He was indeed a lodestone."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="众人大笑。最后轮到鲍比·邦茨致辞，他暗恨朵拉拿他开玩笑，上台后说：“三十年来，我和伊莱·马林共同建起了罗德斯通，他是我生平仅见的最聪明、最善良的人。在他手下工作的这三十年，是我人生中最快乐的三十年。而从今以后，我会继续完成他的梦想。他信任我，让我在之后的五年内掌管公司，我不会让他失望。我不敢指望自己能做到伊莱那么好。他把梦想播洒给了全世界无数的人。他将财富和爱分享给了家人和美国的民众。他的确是块磁石。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Two days after the funeral, Bantz summoned Skippy Deere to the studio and offered him the job of head of production of LoddStone, the job he had held himself. Now he was moving up to Marrion's job as chairman. The rewards he offered Deere were irresistible. Deere would get a share of profits of every movie made by the Studio. He would be able to green-light any picture budgeted for less than thirty million dollars. He would be able to fold his own production company into LoddStone as an independent, and name the head of that company.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="葬礼后两天，邦茨把斯基比·迪尔叫到公司，升任他为罗德斯通的制作总监，也就是邦茨自己曾经的职位。而他现在则接替了马林的位子，做了董事长。他给迪尔提供的薪水很丰厚，迪尔可以从公司拍的每一部电影的票房里抽提成。少于三千万预算的片子，他都能自己决定。他甚至可以把自己的制片公司并入罗德斯通，但保持独立性，由他自己指派这家下属公司的负责人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The assembled mourners knew that Bobby Bantz had written the speech himself, because he had given an important message to the whole movie industry. That he was to rule LoddStone Studios for the next five years and that he expected everyone to give him the same respect they had given Eli Marrion. Bobby Bantz was no longer a Number Two man, he was a Number One.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在场来宾都知道，这是鲍比·邦茨亲手执笔的悼词，因为他向全行业传达了一个重要信息：之后五年内，罗德斯通他说了算，他希望所有人能像尊敬伊莱·马林一样尊敬他。鲍比·邦茨不再是二把手了。他现在是第一把交椅。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Skippy Deere was astounded by the richness of the offer. He analyzed this as a mark of insecurity on Bantz's part. Bantz knew he was weak on the creative side and counted on Deere to cover him.</div>

<div class="line_en">It gave Skippy Deere a glow to think of how rich they would all become. For Deere had been around long enough to know that even Bankable Stars sometimes came to old age in semipoverty. Deere was already very wealthy, but he thought that there were ten levels of being rich and he was only on the first level. Certainly he could live in luxury the rest of his life, but he could not have his own private jet, he could not have five homes and keep them up. He could not keep a harem. He could not afford to be a degenerate gambler. He could not afford another five divorces. He could not afford to keep a hundred servants. He could not even afford to finance his own pictures over any period of time. And he couldn't afford an expensive collection of art, a major Monet or Picasso, as Eli had done. But now someday he would move up from the first level to perhaps as high as the fifth level. He would have to work very hard and be very cunning, and most important, study Bantz very carefully.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯基比·迪尔整天想着他能变得多有钱。迪尔早就知道，即使是卖座明星，老了以后也有不少人生活变得拮据。迪尔已经很有钱了，但是他觉得富有程度排十个档次的话，他自己不过是在第一档罢了。当然，他下半辈子能活得奢侈富足，但他还买不起私家飞机，置不了五座豪宅，养不起情人。他也没钱做个烂赌棍，没法离五次婚，雇不起一百个仆人。甚至没钱给自己的电影投资。他也收藏不起太贵的艺术品，伊莱能为收藏莫奈或是毕加索的名作而伤脑筋，这种事他却做不了。不过从现在开始，说不定哪一天，他就能从第一档升级到第五档呢？要更有钱，他必须得工作得非常努力，同时也得动足脑筋，最重要的是，得摸透邦茨这个人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Deere accepted the offer and appointed Claudia De Lena to head his production company. Not only because she was creative, not only because she really knew movie making, but because he knew she was too honest to undercut him. With her, he would not have to watch his back. In addition, and this was no small thing in making movies, he always enjoyed her company, her good humor. And their sex thing had been gotten out of the way a long time ago.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪尔接受了这份工作，然后指定克劳迪娅·德·莱纳主管他的制片公司。因为她有创意、谙熟电影制作，还因为她很老实，不会瞒着他做小动作。他可以放心大胆地把事情交给她。有她在，他就有了一个得力助手。此外，他也喜欢她的陪伴和她的温和，这两点在电影制片这一行是宝贵的品质。他们早就不是床伴的关系了。">查看中文翻译</div>

He pulled out the cable that held the two plugs, one for oxygen and one for the nitrous oxide. Then he plugged back only one. Nitrous. He sat in the dental chair, reached over and turned the dial.

He had not published a book for five years, and his personality had become less pleasant even to himself. He was always whining about his fate. He was like a sore tooth in the face of society. And this image itself depressed him. What kind of soapy metaphor was this for a writer of his talent? A wave of melancholy swept over him; he was completely powerless.</div>

<div class="line_en">Petie said in his joker's voice, "David my old buddy, you can get your mitts on ten billion? The man whose life I saved? The man who said he could never repay me?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佩蒂耶开玩笑道：“大卫，我的老伙计，你能搞到一百亿元吗？你的小命还是我救下的呢，你不是还说过，这辈子都还不清欠我的债吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Cross said, "The problem is how to get Bantz out of the way. He controls the Studio and whatever his faults, he is loyal to Marrion's wishes. He would never agree to selling the Studio."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克罗斯说道：“问题是怎么让邦茨出局，他控制着公司，不管他能犯什么错，他一直奉行马林的遗愿。他绝不会同意卖掉公司的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Redfellow waved him away. "You don't understand how big money works. It's like whipped cream, you get a small amount and whip it up into a big froth with bonds, loans, stock shares. Money is not the problem."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雷德菲洛不理他的玩笑。“你不懂大宗资金是怎么运转的，那就像生奶油一样，拿一点小钱，然后用债券、贷款和股票把这笔钱搅成越来越蓬松。钱不是问题。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now the Don made his decision. He said to Redfellow, "Carry out your plan. Get it done. But with all caution. Pippi and Croccifixio will be at your command."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="唐作了决定。他对雷德菲洛说：“按你的计划来吧。放手做。但是要小心。皮皮和克罗斯归你指挥。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'll go out there and give him a kiss," Petie said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我去和他谈谈。”佩蒂耶说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"One more thing," Giorgio said to Redfellow. "Bobby Bantz, by the terms of Eli Marrion's will, has total command over the Studio for the next five years. But Marrion's son and daughter have more stock in the company than Bantz. Bantz can't get fired but if the Studio is sold, the new owners will have to pay him off. So that's the problem you have to solve."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“还有一件事，”乔治对雷德菲洛说，“按照伊莱·马林的遗愿，鲍比·邦茨管理电影公司五年。但是马林的儿子和女儿在公司里所持有的股份比邦茨要多。邦茨不会被炒，但如果电影公司出售，要打发掉他还得再花一笔钱。这事儿你也得解决了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Don't worry," the Don said. "I have a lot of money in those banks."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“别担心，”唐说，“我在那些银行里有很多钱。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">David Redfellow smiled and puffed on his cigar. "Just like the old days. Don Clericuzio, the only help I need is yours. Some of those banks in Italy may be reluctant to gamble on such a venture. Remember, we will have to pay a big premium over the actual worth of the Studio."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大卫·雷德菲洛微笑着吐出一口雪茄：“跟那个时候一样。我只需要你——唐·克莱里库齐奥的帮助就够了。意大利有一部分银行也许不愿冒这种险赌一把。要知道，我们花的钱肯定会大于电影公司真正的价值。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Pippi De Lena had watched all this with a wary eye. What disturbed him was the openness of this meeting. By procedure only the Don, Giorgio, and David Redfellow should have been present. Pippi and Cross could have been given orders separately to help Redfellow. Why had they been let in on these secrets? Even more important, why were Dante, Petie, and Vincent brought into the circle? All this was not like the Don Clericuzio he knew, who always kept his plans as secret as possible.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮皮·德·莱纳警惕留意着周围。这次会面有太多人在场，按道理，应该只有唐、乔治和大卫·雷德菲洛在场。皮皮和克罗斯本应该在其他场合受命去协助雷德菲洛。为什么他们要被卷进这个秘密里面来呢？更重要的是，为什么丹特、佩蒂耶和文森特也在？这一切不像是他所认识的唐·克莱里库齐奥的所作所为，他所知道的唐一向是尽可能地把计划内容隐藏起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As soon as they were out of sight, Dante turned to Giorgio and said furiously, "And who gets the Studio when we own it? Cross?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等到他俩离开后，丹特嬉皮笑脸地问乔治：“我们买下电影公司后，谁来管理？克罗斯吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Vincent and Rose Marie were helping the Don up the stairs to go to bed. He had stubbornly refused to have a lift chair installed on the railings.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="文森特和萝塞·玛丽耶扶唐上楼睡觉。他坚决不同意在楼梯上装升降椅。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">David Redfellow interrupted coolly. "I will own the Studio. I will run it. Your grandfather will have a financial interest. This will be documented."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大卫·雷德菲洛淡淡地插了话：“我持有，我经营。有你祖父一笔收入。这些都写入法律文件。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Cross drove their rented car to the airport. During the drive, Pippi said to Cross, "I'm going to spend some time in New York City. I'll just keep the car when we get to the airport."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克罗斯开着租来的车去机场。途中，皮皮对克罗斯说：“我要在纽约市待一段时间。等到了机场，把车给我。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Giorgio agreed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乔治表示认同。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Petie drove Redfellow back to Kennedy Airport where his private jet waited. Cross and Pippi had used a chartered jet from Vegas. Don Clericuzio absolutely forbade the owning of a jet by the Xanadu or any of his enterprises.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佩蒂耶载着雷德菲洛去肯尼迪机场，他的私人飞机停在那里。克罗斯和皮皮包了一家飞机从拉斯维加斯飞过来。唐·克莱里库齐奥严禁桃源酒店或他名下任何产业买飞机。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Pippi studied all of them. He was good at scenting danger. That's why he had lived so long. But this he couldn't figure out. Maybe the Don was just getting old.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮皮看着他们所有人。他对危险一直都很敏感，这也是他能活那么久的原因。但是这次他也弄不明白，也许只是因为唐老了吧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You were OK," Pippi said. "But the Don was right. You can't let anybody screw you twice."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你还好，”皮皮说，“但唐说的没错，你不能让任何人一而再地占你便宜。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Cross saw that his father was worried. "I didn't do well in there," he said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克罗斯看着紧张的父亲。“我表现得不好。”他说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Cross said laughing, "Dante, neither one of us can run a movie studio. We're not ruthless enough."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克罗斯笑道：“丹特，我们俩谁也不适合经营电影公司。我们还没冷血到那个程度啊。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When they arrived at Kennedy, Cross got out and Pippi slid across the seat to get behind the wheel. Through the open window, they shook hands. In that moment Pippi looked up at his son's handsome face and felt an enormous wave of affection. He tried to smile as he slapped Cross gently on the cheek and said, "Be careful."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们抵达肯尼迪机场的时候，克罗斯下车，皮皮从副驾驶钻到了驾驶位。车窗摇下来，他们握了握手。皮皮抬头看着他儿子英俊的脸庞，满是欣慰。他轻柔地拍了拍克罗斯，试图挤出一个微笑，说：“要小心。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“所有的东西。”皮皮说，然后，说了一句让克罗斯震惊的话，“也许我该让你跟着你的妈妈，但是我太自私了，我想把你留在身边。”">查看中文翻译</div>
