<div class="line_en">Again he shook his head. "I'm sorry. I know that would have answered some questions for you. Only two direct lines of Merovingians remain. Their family names are Plantard and Saint-Clair. Both families live in hiding, probably protected by the Priory."</div>

<div class="line_en">He had torn open old wounds that felt as painful now as ever. They are dead, Sophie. They are not coming back. She thought of her mother singing her to sleep at night, of her father giving her rides on his shoulders, and of her grandmother and younger brother smiling at her with their fervent green eyes. All that was stolen. And all she had left was her grandfather.</div>

<div class="line_en">"The Grail story is everywhere, but it is hidden. When the Church outlawed speaking of the shunned Mary Magdalene, her story and importance had to be passed on through more discreet channels… channels that supported metaphor and symbolism."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title='"圣杯的故事无处不在，只不过被隐藏了起来，不易被发现罢了。罗马教廷不许人们公开谈论逃亡的玛利亚，于是人们便以隐秘的方法记录她的故事。这些方法包括比喻和象征等。"'>查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title='"我不明白。"'>查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Of course. The arts." Langdon motioned to The Last Supper. "A perfect example. Some of today's most enduring art, literature, and music secretly tell the history of Mary Magdalene and Jesus." Langdon quickly told her about works by Da Vinci, Botticelli, Poussin, Bernini, Mozart, and Victor Hugo that all whispered of the quest to restore the banished sacred feminine. Enduring legends like Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, King Arthur, and Sleeping Beauty were Grail allegories. Victor Hugo's Hunchback of Notre Dame and Mozart's Magic Flute were filled with Masonic symbolism and Grail secrets.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title='"当然了，是通过艺术作品。"兰登指着墙上的《最后的晚餐》，说道："这就是一个完美的例子。许多不朽的文学、音乐作品中都暗含着玛利亚。抹大拉和耶稣的故事。"兰登简要地向索菲介绍了达·芬奇、波提切利、莫扎特和维克多。雨果的一些作品。那些作品都以隐秘的方法表达了恢复圣女玛利亚地位的希望。那些美丽的传说——如圆桌骑士、亚瑟王和睡美人等——都源于圣杯的故事。维克多。雨果的《巴黎圣母院》和莫扎特的《魔笛》都运用了象征手法来将圣杯的故事暗含其中。'>查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Once you open your eyes to the Holy Grail," Langdon said, "you see her everywhere. Paintings. Music. Books. Even in cartoons, theme parks, and popular movies."Langdon held up his Mickey Mouse watch and told her that Walt Disney had made it his quiet life's work to pass on the Grail story to future generations. Throughout his entire life, Disney had been hailed as "the Modern-Day Leonardo da Vinci." Both men were generations ahead of their times, uniquely gifted artists, members of secret societies, and, most notably, avid pranksters. Like Leonardo, Walt Disney loved infusing hidden messages and symbolism in his art. For the trained symbologist, watching an early Disney movie was like being barraged by an avalanche of allusion and metaphor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title='"一旦你睁开眼睛寻找圣杯。"兰登说道。"你就会发现她无处不在。绘画、音乐、书籍，甚至是卡通片、主题公园和卖座的电影里都有她的身影。"兰顿举起手腕上的米奇手表，告诉索菲："沃尔特。迪斯尼一生都在默默地致力于圣杯故事的保存和宣扬。他被人们誉为"当代的列昂纳多。达·芬奇"。"这两个人都是时代的先锋，都是举世无双的天才艺术家，都是隐修会成员，而且都以喜欢恶作剧而闻名。像达·芬奇一样，沃尔特。迪斯尼也喜欢运用象征手法并在其作品中藏人秘密。对于一个训练有素的符号学家来说，观看迪斯尼早期的电影就像是在观看欣赏无数的暗示和比喻。'>查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Most of Disney's hidden messages dealt with religion, pagan myth, and stories of the subjugated goddess. It was no mistake that Disney retold tales like Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, and Snow White -- all of which dealt with the incarceration of the sacred feminine. Nor did one need a background in symbolism to understand that Snow White -- a princess who fell from grace after partaking of a poisoned apple -- was a clear allusion to the downfall of Eve in the Garden of Eden. Or that Sleeping Beauty's Princess Aurora -- code-named "Rose" and hidden deep in the forest to protect her from the clutches of the evil witch -- was the Grail story for children.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title='迪斯尼的大部分电影里都有异教传说、圣杯故事的影子。迪斯尼公司将"灰姑娘"、"睡美人"和"白雪公主"的故事搬上银幕，就是因为它们描述的都是遭受迫害的神圣女性的故事。人们无需象征学的知识就能明白，那里公主吃了毒苹果变成丑八怪的情节明显地影射了夏娃的堕落。人们也很容易看出，人称"玫瑰"的奥罗拉公主和躲避追杀的"睡美人"的故事，实际上就是儿童版的圣杯故事。'>查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Despite its corporate image, Disney still had a savvy, playful element among its employees, and their artists still amused themselves by inserting hidden symbolism in Disney products. Langdon would never forget one of his students bringing in a DVD of The Lion King and pausing the film to reveal a freeze-frame in which the word SEX was clearly visible, spelled out by floating dust particles over Simba's head. Although Langdon suspected this was more of a cartoonist's sophomoric prank than any kind of enlightened allusion to pagan human sexuality, he had learned not to underestimate Disney's grasp of symbolism. The Little Mermaid was a spellbinding tapestry of spiritual symbols so specifically goddess-related that they could not be coincidence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title='迪斯尼公司的工作人员常常会在电影制作中掺进一些隐含的象征意义。兰登还记得，有一次，一个学生带来了一盘《狮子王》DVD。在播放碟片时，那个学生突然按了暂停键，给大家看了一个定格画面。画面上，飘浮在"辛巴"头上的尘土组成了"SEX"（性）的字样。在兰登看来，这与其说这是制作者对享受性生活的暗示，倒不如说是他们的恶作剧。兰登还发现迪斯尼对象征手法的运用能力不可低估。电影《美人鱼》中的多彩画面包含了大量象征元素，这些象征大多都跟女神有关，这绝对不可能是巧合。'>查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When Langdon had first seen The Little Mermaid, he had actually gasped aloud when he noticed that the painting in Ariel's underwater home was none other than seventeenth-century artist Georges de la Tour's The Penitent Magdalene -- a famous homage to the banished Mary Magdalene -- fitting decor considering the movie turned out to be a ninety-minute collage of blatant symbolic references to the lost sanctity of Isis, Eve, Pisces the fish goddess, and, repeatedly, Mary Magdalene. The Little Mermaid's name, Ariel, possessed powerful ties to the sacred feminine and, in the Book of Isaiah, was synonymous with "the Holy City besieged." Of course, the Little Mermaid's flowing red hair was certainly no coincidence either.</div>

<div class="line_en">兰登第一次看到《美人鱼》时,大吃一惊.他发现电影中"水下住宅"的样子跟十七世纪画家乔治.德拉.图尔所画的《悔过的抹大拉》上的建筑一模一样.那幅画是为被驱逐的玛利亚.抹大拉而作的,只不过与原作相比,电影中的画面有些艳丽.小美人鱼的名字--阿日耳--跟神圣的女性也有紧密的联系,它在《伊沙梅尔的书》中表示"被围困的圣城".当然了,小美人鱼那一头飘动的红发也有独特的象征意义.</div>
