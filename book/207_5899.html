<div class="line_en">I both wished and feared to see Mr. Rochester on the day which followed this sleepless night: I wanted to hear his voice again, yet feared to meet his eye. During the early part of the morning, I momentarily expected his coming; he was not in the frequent habit of entering the schoolroom, but he did step in for a few minutes sometimes, and I had the impression that he was sure to visit it that day.</div>

<div class="line_en">But the morning passed just as usual: nothing happened to interrupt the quiet course of Adèle's studies; only soon after breakfast, I heard some bustle in the neighbourhood of Mr. Rochester's chamber, Mrs. Fairfax's voice, and Leah's, and the cook's -- that is, John's wife -- and even John's own gruff tones. There were exclamations of "What a mercy master was not burnt in his bed!" "It is always dangerous to keep a candle lit at night." "How providential that he had presence of mind to think of the water-jug!" "I wonder he waked nobody!" "It is to be hoped he will not take cold with sleeping on the library sofa," &amp;c.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，早上像往常那么过去了。没有发生什么影响阿黛勒宁静学习课程的事情。只是早饭后不久，我听到罗切斯特先生卧室附近一阵喧闹，有费尔法克斯太太的嗓音，还有莉娅的和厨师的——也就是约翰妻子的嗓音，甚至还有约翰本人粗哑的调门，有人大惊小怪地叫着：“真幸运呀，老爷没有给烧死在床上！”“点蜡烛过夜总归是危险的。”“真是上帝保佑，他还能那么清醒，想起了水罐！”“真奇怪，他谁都没有吵醒！”“但愿他睡在图书室沙发上不会着凉！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There she sat, staid and taciturn-looking, as usual, in her brown stuff gown, her check apron, white handkerchief, and cap. She was intent on her work, in which her whole thoughts seemed absorbed: on her hard forehead, and in her commonplace features, was nothing either of the paleness or desperation one would have expected to see marking the countenance of a woman who had attempted murder, and whose intended victim had followed her last night to her lair, and (as I believed), charged her with the crime she wished to perpetrate. I was amazed -- confounded. She looked up, while I still gazed at her: no start, no increase or failure of colour betrayed emotion, consciousness of guilt, or fear of detection. She said "Good morning, Miss," in her usual phlegmatic and brief manner; and taking up another ring and more tape, went on with her sewing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她坐在那里，还是往常那付沉默寡言的样子，穿着褐色料子服，系着格子围裙，揣着白手帕，戴着帽子。她专心致志地忙着手头的活儿，似乎全身心都扑上去了。她冷漠的额头和普普通通的五官，既不显得苍白，也不见绝望的表情，那种人们期望在一个蓄谋杀人的女人脸上看到的表情特征，而且那位受害者昨晚跟踪到了她的藏身之处，并（如我所相信）指控她蓄意犯罪。我十分惊讶，甚至感到惶惑。我继续盯着她看时，她抬起了头来，没有惊慌之态，没有变脸色，而因此泄露她的情绪和负罪感，以及害怕被发现的恐惧心理。她以平时那种冷淡和简慢的态度说了声：“早安，小姐，”又拿起一个挂环和一圈线带，继续缝了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">To much confabulation succeeded a sound of scrubbing and setting to rights; and when I passed the room, in going downstairs to dinner, I saw through the open door that all was again restored to complete order; only the bed was stripped of its hangings. Leah stood up in the window-seat, rubbing the panes of glass dimmed with smoke. I was about to address her, for I wished to know what account had been given of the affair: but, on advancing, I saw a second person in the chamber -- a woman sitting on a chair by the bedside, and sewing rings to new curtains. That woman was no other than Grace Poole.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一番闲聊之后，响起了擦擦洗洗，收拾整理的声音。我下楼吃饭经过这间房子，从开着的门后进去，只见一切都又恢复得井井有条。只有床上的帐幔都已拆除，莉娅站在窗台上，擦着被烟薰黑的玻璃。我希望知道这件事是怎么解释的，正要同她讲话，但往前一看，只见房里还有第二个人——一个女人，坐在床边的椅子上，缝着新窗帘的挂环。那女人正是格雷斯·普尔。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The servants sleep so far off, you know, Miss, they would not be likely to hear. Mrs. Fairfax's room and yours are the nearest to master's; but Mrs. Fairfax said she heard nothing: when people get elderly, they often sleep heavy." She paused, and then added, with a sort of assumed indifference, but still in a marked and significant tone -- "But you are young, Miss; and I should say a light sleeper: perhaps you may have heard a noise?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“仆人们睡的地方离得很远，你知道的，小姐，她们不可能听到。费尔法克斯太太的房间和你的离老爷的卧室最近，但费尔法克斯太太说她没有听到什么，人老了，总是睡得很死，”她顿了一顿，随后装作若无其事的样子，却以清楚而意味深长的语调补充说：“不过你很年轻，小姐，而且应当说睡得不熟，也许你听到了什么声音。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Then you are not in the habit of bolting your door every night before you get into bed?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那你每天睡觉之前没有拴门的习惯吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It will be wise so to do," was her answer: "this neighbourhood is as quiet as any I know, and I never heard of the hall being attempted by robbers since it was a house; though there are hundreds of pounds' worth of plate in the plate-closet, as is well known. And you see, for such a large house, there are very few servants, because master has never lived here much; and when he does come, being a bachelor, he needs little waiting on: but I always think it best to err on the safe side; a door is soon fastened, and it is as well to have a drawn bolt between one and any mischief that may be about. A deal of people, Miss, are for trusting all to Providence; but I say Providence will not dispense with the means, though He often blesses them when they are used discreetly." And here she closed her harangue: a long one for her, and uttered with the demureness of a Quakeress.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这样做才聪明呢，”她回答，“这一带跟我知道的任何地方都一样安静，打从府宅建成以来、我还没有听说过有强盗上门呢。尽管谁都知道，盘子柜里有价值几百英镑的盘子，而且你知道，老爷不在这里长住，就是来住，因为是单身汉也不大要人服侍，所以这么大的房子，只有很少几个仆人。不过我总认为过份注意安全总比不注意安全好，门一下子就能拴上，还是拴上门，把自己和可能发生的祸害隔开为好。小姐，很多人都把一切托付给上帝，但要我说呀，上帝不会排斥采取措施，尽管他只常常祝福那些谨慎采取的措施，”说到这里她结束了长篇演说。这番话对地来说是够长的了，而且口气里带着贵格会女教徒的假正经。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Fiend! she wants to know my habits, that she may lay her plans accordingly!" Indignation again prevailed over prudence: I replied sharply, "Hitherto I have often omitted to fasten the bolt: I did not think it necessary. I was not aware any danger or annoyance was to be dreaded at Thornfield Hall: but in future" (and I laid marked stress on the words) "I shall take good care to make all secure before I venture to lie down."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这恶魔！她想知道我的习惯，好以此来算计我：”愤怒再次压倒谨慎，我尖刻地回答：“到目前为止我还是常常忽略了拴门，我认为没有这必要，我以前没有意识到在桑菲尔德还要担心什么危险或者烦恼，不过将来（我特别强调了这几个字），我要小心谨慎，弄得一切都安安全全了才敢躺下睡觉。”">查看中文翻译</div>

He had almost as much as declared his conviction of her criminality last night: what mysterious cause withheld him from accusing her? Why had he enjoined me, too, to secrecy? It was strange: a bold, vindictive, and haughty gentleman seemed somehow in the power of one of the meanest of his dependants; so much in her power, that even when she lifted her hand against his life, he dared not openly charge her with the attempt, much less punish her for it.</div>

<div class="line_en">Had Grace been young and handsome, I should have been tempted to think that tenderer feelings than prudence or fear influenced Mr. Rochester in her behalf; but, hard-favoured and matronly as she was, the idea could not be admitted. "Yet," I reflected, "she has been young once; her youth would be contemporary with her master's: Mrs. Fairfax told me once, she had lived here many years. I don't think she can ever have been pretty; but, for aught I know, she may possess originality and strength of character to compensate for the want of personal advantages. Mr. Rochester is an amateur of the decided and eccentric: Grace is eccentric at least. What if a former caprice (a freak very possible to a nature so sudden and headstrong as his) has delivered him into her power, and she now exercises over his actions a secret influence, the result of his own indiscretion, which he cannot shake off, and dare not disregard?" But, having reached this point of conjecture, Mrs. Poole's square, flat figure, and uncomely, dry, even coarse face, recurred so distinctly to my mind's eye, that I thought, "No; impossible! My supposition cannot be correct. Yet," suggested the secret voice which talks to us in our own hearts, "you are not beautiful either, and perhaps Mr. Rochester approves you: at any rate, you have often felt as if he did; and last night -- remember his words; remember his look; remember his voice!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="要是格雷斯年轻漂亮，我会不由得认为，那种比谨慎或忧虑更为温存的情感左右了罗切斯特先生，使他偏袒于她。可是她面貌丑陋，又是一付管家婆样子，这种想法也就站不住脚了。“不过，”我思忖道，“她曾有过青春年华，那时主人也跟她一样年轻。费尔法克斯太太曾告诉我，她在这里已住了很多年。我认为她从来就没有姿色，但是也许她性格的力量和独特之处弥补了外貌上的不足。罗切斯特先生喜欢果断和古怪的人，格雷斯至少很古怪。要是从前一时的荒唐（像他那种刚愎自用、反复无常的个性，完全有可能干出轻率的事来）使他落入了她的掌中，行为上的不检点酿成了恶果，使他如今对格雷斯所施加给自己的秘密影响，既无法摆脱，又不能漠视，那又有什么奇怪呢？但是，一想到这里，普尔太太宽阔、结实、扁平的身材和丑陋干瘪甚至粗糙的面容，便清晰地浮现在我眼前，于是我想：“不，不可能！我的猜想不可能是对的。不过，”一个在我心里悄悄说话的声音建议道：“你自己也并不漂亮，而罗切斯特先生却赞赏你，至少你总是觉得好像他是这样，而且昨天晚上——别忘了他的话，别忘了他的神态，别忘了他的嗓音！”">查看中文翻译</div>

Bessie Leaven had said I was quite a lady; and she spoke truth -- I was a lady.

<div class="line_en">When dusk actually closed, and when Adèle left me to go and play in the nursery with Sophie, I did most keenly desire it. I listened for the bell to ring below; I listened for Leah coming up with a message; I fancied sometimes I heard Mr. Rochester's own tread, and I turned to the door, expecting it to open and admit him. The door remained shut; darkness only came in through the window. Still it was not late; he often sent for me at seven and eight o'clock, and it was yet but six. Surely I should not be wholly disappointed to-night, when I had so many things to say to him! I wanted again to introduce the subject of Grace Poole, and to hear what he would answer; I wanted to ask him plainly if he really believed it was she who had made last night's hideous attempt; and if so, why he kept her wickedness a secret. It little mattered whether my curiosity irritated him; I knew the pleasure of vexing and soothing him by turns; it was one I chiefly delighted in, and a sure instinct always prevented me from going too far; beyond the verge of provocation I never ventured; on the extreme brink I liked well to try my skill. Retaining every minute form of respect, every propriety of my station, I could still meet him in argument without fear or uneasy restraint; this suited both him and me.</div>

<div class="line_en">A tread creaked on the stairs at last. Leah made her appearance; but it was only to intimate that tea was ready in Mrs. Fairfax's room. Thither I repaired, glad at least to go downstairs; for that brought me, I imagined, nearer to Mr. Rochester's presence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="楼梯上终于响起了吱格的脚步声，莉娅来了，但她不过是来通知茶点己在费尔法克斯太太房间里摆好，我朝那走去，心里很是高兴，至少可以到楼下去了。我想这么一来离罗切斯特先生更近了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You must want your tea," said the good lady, as I joined her; "you ate so little at dinner. I am afraid," she continued, "you are not well to-day: you look flushed and feverish."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，他吃好早饭就出去了！他去了里斯。埃希顿先生那儿，在米尔科特的另一边，离这儿十英里，我想那儿聚集了一大批人，英格拉姆勋爵、乔治·林恩爵士、登特上校等都在。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"There are Mrs. Eshton and her three daughters -- very elegant young ladies indeed; and there are the Honourable Blanche and Mary Ingram, most beautiful women, I suppose: indeed I have seen Blanche, six or seven years since, when she was a girl of eighteen. She came here to a Christmas ball and party Mr. Rochester gave. You should have seen the dining-room that day -- how richly it was decorated, how brilliantly lit up! I should think there were fifty ladies and gentlemen present -- all of the first county families; and Miss Ingram was considered the belle of the evening."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“有伊希顿太太和她的三个女儿——真还都是举止文雅的年轻小姐。还有可尊敬的布兰奇和玛丽·英格拉姆，我想都是非常漂亮的女人。说实在我是六七年前见到布兰奇的，当时她才十八岁。她来这里参加罗切斯特先生举办的圣诞舞会和聚会。你真该看一看那一天的餐室——布置得那么豪华，点得又那么灯火辉煌！我想有五十位女士和先生在场——都是出身于郡里的上等人家。英格拉姆小姐是那天晚上公认的美女。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No -- nor to-morrow either; I should think he is very likely to stay a week or more: when these fine, fashionable people get together, they are so surrounded by elegance and gaiety, so well provided with all that can please and entertain, they are in no hurry to separate. Gentlemen especially are often in request on such occasions; and Mr. Rochester is so talented and so lively in society, that I believe he is a general favourite: the ladies are very fond of him; though you would not think his appearance calculated to recommend him particularly in their eyes: but I suppose his acquirements and abilities, perhaps his wealth and good blood, make amends for any little fault of look."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，——明天也不会回来。我想他很可能呆上一个礼拜，或者更长一点。这些杰出的上流社会的人物相聚，气氛欢快，格调高雅，娱乐款待，应有尽有，所以他们不急于散伙。而在这样的场合，尤其需要有教养有身份的人。罗切斯特先生既有才能，在社交场中又很活跃，我想他一定受到大家的欢迎。女士们都很喜欢他，尽管你会认为，在她们眼里他的外貌并没有特别值得赞许的地方。不过我猜想，他的学识、能力，也许还有他的财富和血统，弥补了他外貌上的小小缺陷。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes, I saw her. The dining-room doors were thrown open; and, as it was Christmas-time, the servants were allowed to assemble in the hall, to hear some of the ladies sing and play. Mr. Rochester would have me to come in, and I sat down in a quiet corner and watched them. I never saw a more splendid scene: the ladies were magnificently dressed; most of them -- at least most of the younger ones -- looked handsome; but Miss Ingram was certainly the queen."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是呀、我看到她了，餐室的门敞开着，而且因为圣诞期间，允许佣人们聚在大厅里，听一些女士们演唱和弹奏。罗切斯特先生要我进去，我就在一个安静的角落里坐下来看她们。我从来没有见过这么光彩夺目的景象。女士们穿戴得富丽堂皇，大多数——至少是大多数年轻女子，长得很标致，而英格拉姆小姐当然是女皇了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Tall, fine bust, sloping shoulders; long, graceful neck: olive complexion, dark and clear; noble features; eyes rather like Mr. Rochester's: large and black, and as brilliant as her jewels. And then she had such a fine head of hair; raven-black and so becomingly arranged: a crown of thick plaits behind, and in front the longest, the glossiest curls I ever saw. She was dressed in pure white; an amber-coloured scarf was passed over her shoulder and across her breast, tied at the side, and descending in long, fringed ends below her knee. She wore an amber-coloured flower, too, in her hair: it contrasted well with the jetty mass of her curls."</div>

Poor stupid dupe! -- Could not even self-interest make you wiser? You repeated to yourself this morning the brief scene of last night? -- Cover your face and be ashamed! He said something in praise of your eyes, did he? Blind puppy! Open their bleared lids and look on your own accursed senselessness! It does good to no woman to be flattered by her superior, who cannot possibly intend to marry her; and it is madness in all women to let a secret love kindle within them, which, if unreturned and unknown, must devour the life that feeds it; and, if discovered and responded to, must lead, ignis-fatus-like, into miry wilds whence there is no extrication.</div>
