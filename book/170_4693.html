<div class="line_en">Cersei paced her cell, restless as the caged lions that had lived in the bowels of Casterly Rock when she was a girl, a legacy of her grandfather's time. She and Jaime used to dare each other to climb into their cage, and once she worked up enough courage to slip her hand between two bars and touch one of the great tawny beasts. She was always bolder than her brother. The lion had turned his head to stare at her with huge golden eyes. Then he licked her fingers. His tongue was as rough as a rasp, but even so she would not pull her hand back, not until Jaime took her by the shoulders and yanked her away from the cage.</div>

<div class="line_en">Even so, she was afraid. On the day Myrcella sailed for Dorne, the day of the bread riots, gold cloaks had been posted all along the route of the procession, but the mob had broken through their lines to tear the old fat High Septon into pieces and rape Lollys Stokeworth half a hundred times. And if that pale soft stupid creature could incite the animals when fully clothed, how much more lust would a queen inspire?</div>

<div class="line_en">Barefoot and shivering she paced, a thin blanket draped about her shoulders. She was anxious for the day to come. By evening it would all be done. A little walk and I'll be home, I'll be back with Tommen, in my own chambers inside Maegor's Holdfast. Her uncle said it was the only way to save herself. Was it, though? She could not trust her uncle, no more than she trusted this High Septon. I could still refuse. I could still insist upon my innocence and hazard all upon a trial.</div>

<div class="line_en">But she dare not let the Faith sit in judgment on her, as that Margaery Tyrell meant to do. That might serve the little rose well enough, but Cersei had few friends amongst the septas and sparrows around this new High Septon. Her only hope was trial by battle, and for that she must needs have a champion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是她不敢让教会审判她，就像玛格丽·提利尔即将面对的审判那样。小玫瑰也许能顺利过关，但是在这些围绕在新任大主教身边的主教和麻雀之中，几乎没有人是瑟曦的朋友。她唯一的希望是比武审判，那样的话她就必须有一个代理骑士。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That road led nowhere, though. Jaime's sword hand was gone, and so was he, vanished with the woman Brienne somewhere in the riverlands. The queen had to find another defender or today's ordeal would be the least of her travails. Her enemies were accusing her of treason. She had to reach Tommen, no matter the costs. He loves me. He will not refuse his own mother. Joff was stubborn and unpredictable, but Tommen is a good little boy, a good little king. He will do as he is told. If she stayed here, she was doomed, and the only way she would return to the Red Keep was by walking. The High Sparrow had been adamant, and Ser Kevan refused to lift a finger against him.</div>

<div class="line_en">When her gaolers came for her, Septa Unella, Septa Moelle, and Septa Scolera led the procession. With them were four novices and two of the silent sisters.

<div class="line_en">"Nor will it." Septa Unella beckoned to the novices. They brought lye soap, a basin of warm water, a pair of shears, and a long straightrazor. The sight of the steel sent a shiver through her. They mean to shave me. A little more humiliation, a raisin for my porridge. She would not give them the pleasure of hearing her beg.

<div class="line_en">The elder of the two silent sisters took up the shears. A practiced barber, no doubt; her order often cleaned the corpses of the noble slain before returning them to their kin, and trimming beards and cutting hair was part of that. The woman bared the queen's head first. Cersei sat as still as a stone statue as the shears clicked. Drifts of golden hair fell to the floor. She had not been allowed to tend it properly penned up in this cell, but even unwashed and tangled it shone where the sun touched it. My crown, the queen thought. They took the other crown away from me, and now they are stealing this one as well. When her locks and curls were piled up around her feet, one of the novices soaped her head and the silent sister scraped away the stubble with a razor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两个年老的静默姐妹拿起大剪刀，她们手艺纯熟，这点毋庸置疑；她们经常要把被杀死的大贵族的尸体在送还给亲戚之前清理干净，而剃须和理发正是其中的一环。她们首先剃光了太后的脑袋。剪刀咔嚓咔嚓的时候，瑟曦静静坐着如同一尊石像。金发飘落在地上。在牢房里的时候，她没有机会好好保养头发，但即使没有洗过，并且已经纠结在一起，当阳光照射在这些头发上，依然闪闪发光。我的王冠，太后想，她们已经拿走了我的另一顶王冠，现在又来抢我这顶了。当打结卷曲的长发在脚边堆积起来之后，一个见习修女为她打上肥皂沫，静默姐妹接着用剃刀刮去了剩下短发茬。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then it was the soap again, the warm water, and the razor. The hair beneath her arms went next, then her legs, and last of all the fine golden down that covered her mound. When the silent sister crept between her legs with the razor, Cersei found herself remembering all the times that Jaime had knelt where she was kneeling now, planting kisses on the inside of her thighs, making her wet. His kisses were always warm. The razor was ice-cold.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着又是肥皂，热水，和剃刀。先是腋窝下的毛，然后是腿上的，最后剃掉了原本覆盖在私处的美丽的金色。当静默姐妹用剃刀在她双腿间剃毛的时候，瑟曦发觉自己正在回想，每次詹姆像她现在这样跪着，把吻种进她的大腿深处，让她变湿。他的吻总是那么温暖，而剃刀却是那么冰冷。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One of the novices had brought a robe for her, a soft white septa's robe to cover her as she made her way down the tower steps and through the sept, so any worshipers they met along the way might be spared the sight of naked flesh.

<div class="line_en">It came to her suddenly that she had stood in this very spot before, on the day Lord Eddard Stark had lost his head. That was not supposed to happen. Joff was supposed to spare his life and send him to the Wall. Stark's eldest son would have followed him as Lord of Winterfell, but Sansa would have stayed at court, a hostage. Varys and Littlefinger had worked out the terms, and Ned Stark had swallowed his precious honor and confessed his treason to save his daughter's empty little head. I would have made Sansa a good marriage. A Lannister marriage. Not Joff, of course, but Lancel might have suited, or one of his younger brothers. Petyr Baelish had offered to wed the girl himself, she recalled, but of course that was impossible; he was much too lowborn. If Joff had only done as he was told, Winterfell would never have gone to war, and Father would have dealt with Robert's brothers.</div>

The mob seemed to be equal parts men and women. Some had children on their shoulders. Beggars and thieves, taverners and tradesfolk, tanners and stableboys and mummers, the poorer sort of whore, all the scum had come out to see a queen brought low. And mingled in with them were the Poor Fellows, filthy, unshaven creatures armed with spears and axes and clad in bits of dinted plate, rusted mail, and cracked leather, under roughspun surcoats bleached white and blazoned with the seven-pointed star of the Faith. The High Sparrow's ragged army.</div>

<div class="line_en">Though she had been too young to witness the spectacle herself, Cersei had heard the stories growing up from the mouths of washerwomen and guardsmen who had been there. They spoke of how the woman had wept and begged, of the desperate way she clung to her garments when she was commanded to disrobe, of her futile efforts to cover her breasts and her sex with her hands as she hobbled barefoot and naked through the streets to exile. "Vain and proud she was, before," she remembered one guard saying, "so haughty you'd think she'd forgot she come from dirt. Once we got her clothes off her, though, she was just another whore."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然那时她太小，没能亲眼看到当时的场景，但瑟曦是从亲眼目睹的洗衣妇和守卫那里听着这个故事长大的。他们讲述那女人如何哭泣和乞求，当被勒令脱下衣服的时候，她是怎样绝望的紧紧抱着衣服，当她遭到驱逐赤身裸体跌跌撞撞地穿过大街小巷的时候，又是如何无力的用手遮掩胸口和私处。“她曾是那么虚荣和骄傲。”她想起来一个守卫说过，“那么傲慢，让你觉得她是不是忘记了自己出身低微。但是一旦我们把她的衣服扒下来，她也就不过是个普通的婊子。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She bared herself in one smooth, unhurried motion, as if she were back in her own chambers disrobing for her bath with no one but her bedmaids looking on. When the cold wind touched her skin, she shivered violently. It took all her strength of will not to try and hide herself with her hands, as her grandfather's whore had done. Her fingers tightened into fists, her nails digging into her palms. They were looking at her, all the hungry eyes. But what were they seeing? I am beautiful, she reminded himself. How many times had Jaime told her that? Even Robert had given her that much, when he came to her bed in his cups to pay her drunken homage with his cock.</div>

<div class="line_en">Septa Unella and Septa Moelle kept pace with her, with Septa Scolera scurrying behind, ringing a bell. "Shame," the old hag called, "shame upon the sinner, shame, shame." Somewhere off to the right, another voice sang counterpoint to hers, some baker's boy shouting, "Meat pies, three pence, hot meat pies here." The marble underfoot was cold and slick, and Cersei had to step carefully for fear of slipping. Their path took them past the statue of Baelor the Blessed, standing tall and serene upon his plinth, his face a study in benevolence. To look at him, you would never guess what a fool he'd been. The Targaryen dynasty had produced kings both bad and good, but none as beloved as Baelor, that pious gentle septon-king who loved the smallfolk and the gods in equal parts, yet imprisoned his own sisters. It was a wonder that his statue did not crumble at the sight of her bare breasts. Tyrion used to say that King Baelor was terrified of his own cock. Once, she recalled, he had expelled all the whores from King's Landing. He prayed for them as they were driven from the city gates, the histories said, but would not look at them.</div>

Brown and oozing, it sailed above her head to splash at the foot of one of the Poor Fellows. I am not afraid. I am a lioness. She walked on. "Hot pies," the baker's boy was crying. "Getcha hot pies here." Septa Scolera rang her bell, singing, "Shame, shame, shame upon the sinner, shame, shame."

She looked for the Red Keep, but it was hidden now, walled off from her gaze by the tall timbered buildings to either side. "Shame, shame," sang Septa Scolera, her bell clanging. Cersei tried to walk faster, but soon came up against the backs of the Stars in front of her and had to slow her steps again. A man just ahead was selling skewers of roast meat from a cart, and the procession halted as the Poor Fellows moved him out of the way. The meat looked suspiciously like rat to Cersei's eyes, but the smell of it filled the air, and half the men around them were gnawing away with sticks in hand by the time the street was clear enough for her to resume her trek. "Want some, Your Grace?" one man called out. He was a big, burly brute with pig eyes, a massive gut, and an unkempt black beard that reminded her of Robert. When she looked away in disgust, he flung the skewer at her. It struck her on the leg and tumbled to the street, and the half-cooked meat left a smear of grease and blood down her thigh.</div>

A bald man with bushy side-whiskers frowned down from a window with her father's frown, and for an instant looked so much like Lord Tywin that she stumbled. A young girl sat beneath a fountain, drenched in spray, and stared at her with Melara Hetherspoon's accusing eyes. She saw Ned Stark, and beside him little Sansa with her auburn hair and a shaggy grey dog that might have been her wolf. Every child squirming through the crowd became her brother Tyrion, jeering at her as he had jeered when Joffrey died. And there was Joff as well, her son, her firstborn, her beautiful bright boy with his golden curls and his sweet smile, he had such lovely lips, he…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="太后开始看到一些熟悉的面孔。一个两鬓胡须浓密的秃头男人在窗边像他父亲一样皱眉往下看，有那么一瞬间看起来像极了泰温公爵，让她脚下踉跄。一个年轻姑娘坐在喷泉之下，浑身淋得湿透，用梅拉雅·赫斯班一样责备的眼神盯着她。她看到了奈德·史塔克，他旁边是红发的小珊莎和一条长毛灰狗，那很可能是她的狼。每个在人群中钻来钻去的小孩都成了她弟弟提利昂，就像乔佛里死时一样嘲讽地看着她。而她也看见了小乔，她的儿子，她的长子，她那一头金色卷发的漂亮聪明儿子和他甜美的微笑，他有着那么可爱的嘴唇，他…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">If anything, the jeers and shouts were cruder here. Her walk had not taken her through Flea Bottom, so its denizens had packed onto the lower slopes of Aegon's High Hill to see the show. The faces leering out at her from behind the shields and spears of the Poor Fellows seemed twisted, monstrous, hideous. Pigs and naked children were everywhere underfoot, crippled beggars and cutpurses swarmed like roaches through the press. She saw men whose teeth had been filed into points, hags with goiters as big as their heads, a whore with a huge striped snake draped about breasts and shoulders, a man whose cheeks and brow were covered with open sores that wept grey pus. They grinned and licked their lips and hooted at her as she went limping past, her breasts heaving with the effort of the climb. Some shouted obscene proposals, others insults. Words are wind, she thought, words cannot hurt me. I am beautiful, the most beautiful woman in all Westeros, Jaime says so, Jaime would never lie to me. Even Robert, Robert never loved me, but he saw that I was beautiful, he wanted me.</div>

<div class="line_en">She did not feel beautiful, though. She felt old, used, filthy, ugly. There were stretch marks on her belly from the children she had borne, and her breasts were not as firm as they had been when she was younger. Without a gown to hold them up, they sagged against her chest. I should not have done this. I was their queen, but now they've seen, they've seen, they've seen. I should never have let them see. Gowned and crowned, she was a queen. Naked, bloody, limping, she was only a woman, not so very different from their wives, more like their mothers than their pretty little maiden daughters.

<div class="line_en">And then there was no stopping the tears. They burned down the queen's cheeks like acid. Cersei gave a sharp cry, covered her nipples with one arm, slid her other hand down to hide her slit, and began to run, shoving her way past the line of Poor Fellows, crouching as she scrambled crab-legged up the hill. Partway up she stumbled and fell, rose, then fell again ten yards farther on. The next thing she knew she was crawling, scrambling uphill on all fours like a dog as the good folks of King's Landing made way for her, laughing and jeering and applauding her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后泪水止不住地流下，就像酸液一样灼伤太后的脸颊。瑟曦发出一声尖叫，用一只手臂挡住乳头，另一只手滑下遮住她的私处，她开始狂奔，从穷人集会中间挤出一条路，弯下腰手忙脚乱地爬上小山。中途她绊倒，爬起来，却又再次摔倒在十码之外。接下来她只知道自己在爬，像君临城里的好人家养的给她让过路的狗一样，四肢并用沿着上坡的路爬，四周爆发出大笑、嘲笑和欢呼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then all at once the crowd parted and seemed to dissolve, and there were the castle gates before her, and a line of spearmen in gilded half-helms and crimson cloaks. Cersei heard the gruff, familiar sound of her uncle growling orders and glimpsed a flash of white to either side as Ser Boros Blount and Ser Meryn Trant strode toward her in their pale plate and snowy cloaks. "My son," she cried. "Where is my son? Where is Tommen?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Then Jocelyn was bending over her, wrapping her in a soft clean blanket of green wool to cover her nakedness. A shadow fell across them both, blotting out the sun. The queen felt cold steel slide beneath her, a pair of great armored arms lifting her off the ground, lifting her up into the air as easily as she had lifted Joffrey when he was still a babe. A giant, thought Cersei, dizzy, as he carried her with great strides toward the gatehouse. She had heard that giants could still be found in the godless wild beyond the Wall. That is just a tale. Am I dreaming?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着乔斯琳跪在她面前，用一张柔软洁净的绿色羊毛毯盖住她赤裸的身体。一道黑影落在他们之间，遮住了阳光。太后感觉到冰冷的钢铁滑到她身下，一双装甲的巨大手臂环绕身下抱起了她，非常轻松地将她举向空中，就像乔佛里还是婴儿时她抱他一样。巨人，瑟曦想，当他带着她大步迈向门房的时候，她甚至感到一阵晕眩。她曾听说在长城以外，无信仰的蛮荒之地仍然可以找到巨人。那不过是个故事。我在做梦吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">No. Her savior was real. Eight feet tall or maybe taller, with legs as thick around as trees, he had a chest worthy of a plow horse and shoulders that would not disgrace an ox. His armor was plate steel, enameled white and bright as a maiden's hopes, and worn over gilded mail. A greathelm hid his face. From its crest streamed seven silken plumes in the rainbow colors of the Faith. A pair of golden seven-pointed stars clasped his billowing cloak at the shoulders. A white cloak.</div>
