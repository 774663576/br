<div class="line_en">So I told the Phelpses that I would go into town to get my bags, which were at the boat station. I hurried up the road and before I was halfway to town, there was Tom Sawyer coming along.</div>

<div class="line_en">We all sat there talking and I could answer all their questions about the Sawyer family. I was feeling really happy about this when suddenly I heard a boat on the river. "Tom could be on that boat," I thought, "and he's going to walk in here and call out my name before I can stop him. I've got to go and meet him."</div>

<div class="line_en">When I heard that, I nearly fell through the floor, but it was a big piece of luck. It was easy for me to be Tom Sawyer because Tom was my best friend. He and his brother Sid lived with their Aunt Polly up in St Petersburg, and I knew all about them. Now I learnt that Aunt Polly had a sister, who was Mrs Phelps. She and her husband were Tom's Aunt Sally and Uncle Silas. And Tom was coming down south by boat to stay with them for a bit.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当我听到这话时，我差点儿没掉进地板缝里去，不过，这可是太幸运了。冒充汤姆·索亚对我来说是件容易事，因为，汤姆是我最好的朋友。他和他的弟弟锡德和他们的菠莉姨妈一起住在圣彼得斯堡，他们的事我都知道，现在，我知道了菠莉姨妈有一个妹妹，她是斐尔普斯太太。她和她的丈夫是汤姆的萨莉姨妈和赛拉斯姨夫。汤姆要乘船南下和他们小住一阵。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When he saw me, his mouth fell open and he looked a bit white in the lace. "Aren't you dead?" he said. "Everybody said that you were murdered!"</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'm not dead yet," I said, "but listen…" I told him about my adventures, and Tom loved all that. Then I told him about the Phelpses and that they thought I was Tom Sawyer. "What shall we do?" I asked him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我还没死呢，”我说道，“可你听着……”我对他讲了我的冒险，汤姆非常喜爱这一切。然后，我跟他讲了斐尔普斯一家的事，并告诉他，他们以为我是汤姆·索亚。“我们该怎么办呢？”我问他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="于是，我拿着包回去了，汤姆半小时后来了。他敲了敲门，萨莉姨妈开门时，他说，他是锡德，汤姆的弟弟。他想使他的来访给他那亲爱的萨莉姨妈一个惊喜，他说道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"All right," I said, "but there's another thing. You know old Miss Watson's slave Jim, who ran away? Well, he's a prisoner here, and I'm going to help him escape."</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's a good plan," he said when I finished. "But it's too easy! It's got to be a real escape, like a real adventure in a story book. So we want something difficult and dangerous. Now, listen to this…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这是一个好计划，”我讲完后他说道，“可太容易了！得像个真正的逃跑，像故事书中的真正的冒险。所以，我们要让这冒险困难点，危险点。听听这个……”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And we sure had a lot of fun with that plan! We knew that Jim was locked up in a hut outside the house. Every night we got out through our bedroom window and dug a hole right under the wall of the hut. It took us a week, and it was hard work. We talked to Jim secretly and told him about the plan, and he was really pleased.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="执行那计划肯定会给我们带来许多的乐趣！我们知道，吉姆被锁在屋外的一个小屋里。每天夜里，我们都从卧室的窗户钻出去，就在小屋墙下挖洞。挖洞花费了我们一星期的时间，这是一件苦差事。我们秘密地同吉姆交谈，并告诉他我们的计划，他高兴极了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We also wrote secret letters to everybody. Tom said that people always do this in books. We wrote that there was a gang of slave-thieves coming up from the south. They wanted to steal Jim and get the three hundred dollars from his owner. Well, the Phelpses and their friends got very excited, and on the night of the escape I went into the sitting-room, and there was a crowd of men in there -- all with guns!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们也给大家写密信。汤姆说，书中人们总是这样做。我们写道，有一群盗奴贼从南方来。他们想偷走吉姆，从他的主人那儿得到300美元。斐尔普斯一家和他们的朋友很兴奋，逃跑的那天夜里，我走进起居室，那儿有一大群男人——都拿着枪！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Well, there wasn't time to think about it because it all happened so quickly. We got Jim out through the hole under the wall, and began to run down to the river. But the men heard us and came after us. They began to shoot, and so we ran as fast as we could to the canoe. We got in it and went over to Spanish Island. My raft was there, and our plan was to escape on that and go on down river.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没有时间考虑了，因为，这一切发生得太快了。我们把吉姆从墙下的洞里弄出来，开始往河边跑去。但是，那些人听到了我们的声音，追了过来，他们开始开枪，我们尽快地往独木舟那儿跑去。我们上了独木舟，前往西班牙岛，我的木筏停在那儿，我们的计划就是逃到那岛上，然后继续顺流而下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I ran and told Tom, and he said that this was really good. "It's a real adventure now, all right," he said, very excited. "Perhaps they'll come after us, and shoot, and we'll all get killed!"</div>
