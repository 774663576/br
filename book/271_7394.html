<div class="line_en">Right. I was the monster now. I had to keep away from scents that might trigger my wild side. From the people that I loved in particular. Even the ones I didn't really know yet.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Is Renesmee… okay… with Jacob there?" I whispered. I realized belatedly that it must have been Jacob's heart I'd heard below. I listened hard again, but I could only hear the one steady pulse. "He doesn't like her much."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那……蕾妮斯梅……和雅各布……在一起没问题吗？”我犹疑的问着，迟钝的意识到刚才楼下的心跳声原来是雅各布的。我再次仔细的听着，不过只能听见一串平稳的脉搏。“他不喜欢她吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Also, this dress -- that Alice must have put me in sometime when I was too lost in the burning to notice -- was not what I would have picked out for either jumping or hunting. Tightly fitted ice-blue silk? What did she think I would need it for? Was there a cocktail party later?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="还有，当我受体内火焰煎熬失去知觉的时候爱丽丝给我穿的裙子——肯定不是我会在运动或打猎的时候穿的。刚好合身的冰蓝色真丝裙？她以为我待会儿要干嘛？鸡尾酒会？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And I was very conscious of my family behind me, watching silently. Mostly silently. Emmett had already chuckled under his breath once. One mistake, and he'd be rolling on the floor. Then the jokes about the world's only clumsy vampire would start…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我知道我的家人们都在我身后等着，安静的看着，至少大部分是安静的。埃美特肯定已经准备好要大笑了。只要我犯一个错，他肯定马上躺到地上滚来滚去的，关于世界上最笨手笨脚的吸血鬼的笑话就会开始了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I watched carefully, analyzing the angle at which he bent his knees to absorb the impact. The sound of his landing was very low -- a muted thud that could have been a door softly closed, or a book gently laid on a table.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我仔细的观察着，分析着他怎样弯曲膝盖来抵消落地的冲击力。他落地时的声音非常小——低沉的砰地一声，就像轻轻的关门或慢慢的把书放在桌上的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I absorbed the impact in the balls of my feet, not wanting to snap off the thin heels. My landing seemed just as quiet as his. I grinned at him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我一心一意的注意着对脚掌的冲击力，不想折断那细小的高跟。我的落地看上去跟他的一样安静。我冲他笑了笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Right. Easy."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“很好，非常简单嘛。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ha! The ground seemed to move toward me so slowly that it was nothing at all to place my feet -- what shoes had Alice put me in? Stilettos? She'd lost her mind -- to place my silly shoes exactly right so that landing was no different than stepping one foot forward on a flat surface.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哇！地面非常缓慢的靠近我，但我找不到落脚的地方——爱丽丝到底给我穿了什么鞋啊？细高跟？她一定是疯了——穿着这白痴鞋子，我小心的降落，就像原来在平地上迈出的一步一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He smiled back. "Bella?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他回了我一个微笑，“贝拉？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That was quite graceful -- even for a vampire."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“即便是对吸血鬼来说，这也非常优雅哦。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Thank you," I told him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我能跟上你。”我告诉他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I considered that for a moment, and then I beamed. If he'd just been saying that, then Emmett would have laughed. No one found his remark humorous, so it must have been true. It was the first time anyone had ever applied the word graceful to me in my entire life… or, well, existence anyway.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我想了一会儿，眉开眼笑。如果刚才他不是这么说，那埃美特肯定早就笑出来了。没人发现过他深藏的小幽默，所以这应该是真的喽。在我整个人生中，这是第一次有人把优雅这个词用在我身上啊。还是……不管了，反正他已经说出口了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And then I hooked the silver satin shoes off my feet one by one and lobbed them together back through the open window. A little too hard, maybe, but I heard someone catch them before they could damage the paneling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后，我把脚上银色的缎带鞋一只一只的脱下来，把他们系在一起扔到楼上打开的窗户里面。可能有点太用力了，但是我听见有人接住它们了，在打坏天花板之前。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I pursed my lips, considering. The river was about fifty yards wide here.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我撅起嘴，想了想。在这里，这条河有50码宽。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Edward took my hand -- I couldn't stop marveling at the smoothness, the comfortable temperature of his skin -- and darted through the backyard to the edge of the river. I went along with him effortlessly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱德华握住我的手——我无法停止为这柔滑的皮肤、舒适的体温所惊讶——然后拉着我冲出后花园，来到河边。我毫不费力的就能跟上他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Show-off," I muttered, and heard his invisible laugh.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“就是爱炫耀，”我嘟哝着，树林里传来他的笑声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Everything physical seemed very simple.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="只要是身体上的运动都变得非常简单。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Are we swimming?" I asked him when we stopped beside the water.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们游过去吗？”我问他，当我们停在河边的时候。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Alice grumbled, "Her fashion sense hasn't improved as much as her balance."</div>

<div class="line_en">He touched my cheek, took two quick backward strides, and then ran back those two steps, launching himself from a flat stone firmly embedded in the riverbank. I studied the flash of movement as he arced over the water, finally turning a somersault just before he disappeared into the thick trees on the other side of the river.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他摸了摸我的脸颊，向后迈了两大步，然后向前猛的冲了两步，从一块平坦坚硬深植在河岸里的石头上起跳。我学习着这一系列动作，随着他划过一条漂亮的弧线，翻了个筋斗，然后消失在河那边茂密的树丛中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You first," I said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你先跳。”我说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And ruin your pretty dress? No. We're jumping."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“然后毁了你那条可爱的裙子？当然不是，我们跳过去。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I backed up five paces, just in case, and took a deep breath.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我向后退了五步，以防万一，深吸了口气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Suddenly, I was anxious again. Not about falling or getting hurt -- I was more worried about the forest getting hurt.</div>

<div class="line_en">Hoping very much that Esme was not particularly fond of any specific trees across the river, I began my first stride. And then stopped when the tight satin split six inches up my thigh. Alice!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="暗自祈祷埃斯梅对河边的树木没什么特别的偏好，但我刚迈出第一步就不得不停下来，发觉自己大腿边的真丝裙子已经裂开了六英寸。爱丽丝！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Much better.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这下好多了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I could hear the muffled laughter in the house, and even the sound of someone gritting her teeth. The laughter came from upstairs and down, and I very easily recognized the much different, rough, throaty chuckle from the first floor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我能听见屋子那边隐约传来的笑声，和某人咬牙切齿的声音。楼上楼下都有，但我毫不费力的就能认出一楼那与众不同的粗哑的低笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It had come on slowly, but I could feel it now -- the raw, massive strength thrilling in my limbs. I was suddenly sure that if I wanted to tunnel under the river, to claw or beat my way straight through the bedrock, it wouldn't take me very long. The objects around me -- the trees, the shrubs, the rocks… the house -- had all begun to look very fragile.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然来得比较慢，但是我还是能感觉到——那新生的、强大的的力量，蕴含在我四肢里。我想，就算我突发奇想的想用爪子在河床下钻个隧道过去，也不会浪费很多时间——所有的树木、地上的灌丛、石头……房子——对我来说都像易碎品一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Well, Alice always seemed to treat clothes as if they were disposable and meant for one -- time usage, so she shouldn't mind this. I bent to carefully grasp the hem at the undamaged right seam between my fingers and, exerting the tiniest amount of pressure possible, I ripped the dress open to the top of my thigh. Then I fixed the other side to match.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过还好，反正对于爱丽丝来说衣服都是随时可弃的一次性物品，她应该不会在意吧。弯下腰小心翼翼的把没事的那边裙子也撕开，打了各结，再把另一边也作了同样处理。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I didn't turn to look at him now, wary of my mood swings. It wouldn't be good to let any emotion take too strong a hold on my frame of mind. Jasper's fears had me on edge, too. I had to hunt before I dealt with anything else. I tried to forget everything else so I could concentrate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我没有转过身看他，怕我的情绪会不受控制。相信让任何强烈的情感夺去我思维的控制权都不是件好事。贾斯帕的担忧让我也变得谨慎起来。在处理其他任何事情之前，我得先去打猎。于是我努力让自己忘记其它所有事，好集中精力。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So Jacob was watching, too? I couldn't imagine what he was thinking now, or what he was still doing here. I'd envisioned our reunion -- if he could ever forgive me -- taking place far in the future, when I was more stable, and time had healed the wounds I'd inflicted in his heart.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="啊，雅各布也在看吗？简直不敢想象他现在在想什么，还有为什么他还在这里。以前，我曾在脑海中幻想过我们的团聚——如果他能原谅我的话——在更远的未来，当我变得稳定能控制自己，而那时，时间也治好了我带给他的伤害。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Bella?" Edward called from the woods, his voice moving closer. "Do you want to watch again?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Unhindered by my skirt, it took only one long bound to reach the water's edge. Just an eighty-fourth of a second, and yet it was plenty of time -- my eyes and my mind moved so quickly that one step was enough.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没了衣服的阻挡，我跨了一步就到达水边。只用了五分之一秒，也已经不短了——眼睛和思维飞快的运动着，告诉我一步就已足够。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But I remembered everything perfectly, of course, and I didn't want to give Emmett a reason to find more humor in my education. This was physical -- it should be instinctive. So I took a deep breath and ran for the river.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可我记得所有的细节，而且更重要的是，我才不想给埃美特又一次在我学习的时候找乐子的机会。既然是身体上的动作，那就应该是靠本能就可以完成的。于是我深吸了一口气，然后冲向河岸。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a strange, giddy, electrifying thing, but a short thing. An entire second had yet to pass, and I was across.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有点奇妙，有点让人晕眩、又有点震惊，还很短暂，一秒钟以后，我就到了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was simple to position my right foot just so against the flat stone and exert the adequate pressure to send my body wheeling up into the air. I was paying more attention to aim than force, and I erred on the amount of power necessary -- but at least I didn't err on the side that would have gotten me wet. The fifty yard width was slightly too easy a distance…</div>

<div class="line_en">Over the sound of my peals of delighted laughter, I could hear Edward racing to find me. My jump had been twice as long as his. When he reached my tree, his eyes were wide. I leaped nimbly from the branch to his side, soundlessly landing again on the balls of my feet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伴随着自己钟声般开心的笑声，我能听见爱德华正向这边跑来，我跳的有他两倍远。当他来到我的树下，他的眼睛睁得大大的，我敏捷的从树枝上跳到他身边。脚掌无声的落地。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I was expecting the close-packed trees to be a problem, but they were surprisingly helpful. It was a simple matter to reach out with one sure hand as I fell back toward the earth again deep inside the forest and catch myself on a convenient branch; I swung lightly from the limb and landed on my toes, still fifteen feet from the ground on the wide bough of a Sitka spruce.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="本来以为那茂密的树林会是个麻烦，让我惊讶的是它们却很有帮助。当我准备落地的时候，随便抓住一枝树桠就停下来了。吊在这棵西卡云杉的树枝荡了两下，然后翻身站在上面。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Very good." He smiled approvingly, but his casual tone didn't match the surprised expression in his eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“很不错。”他赞赏的微笑着，即使面部表情很悠闲，但他惊讶的眼神出卖了他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I could finally understand why Edward never hit the trees when he ran -- a question that had always been a mystery to me. It was a peculiar sensation, the balance between the speed and the clarity. For, while I rocketed over, under, and through the thick jade maze at a rate that should have reduced everything around me to a streaky green blur, I could plainly see each tiny leaf on all the small branches of every insignificant shrub that I passed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在终于明白为什么Edward跑步的时候从来不怕会撞到树上——以前这对我来说一直是解不开的迷。这就像有一个特殊的第六感，在平衡着速度和视觉。为什么说是视觉呢？当我像火箭般在这被浓雾笼罩的迷宫中穿行时，所有周围的事物照理来说在我眼里都应该变成一片条纹一样的绿色光带，但我却能清晰明了的看到任何一棵树最小的枝桠上的绿芽。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He was faster than me. I couldn't imagine how he moved his legs with such blinding speed, but it was beyond me. However, I was stronger, and every stride of mine matched the length of three of his. And so I flew with him through the living green web, by his side, not following at all. As I ran, I couldn't help laughing quietly at the thrill of it; the laughter neither slowed me nor upset my focus.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的步伐比我快多了，简直无法想象他怎么能把手臂甩到连我都看不清的速度，远远超过我的能力范围。然而，我却比他要强壮一些，每步都有他三步长。就这样，我紧紧的跟着他穿过这片绿色的树海。当我奔跑的时候，那种痛快的感受让我不能自已的绽放着笑容。这无声的微笑既没有减慢我的速度，更别说分散我的注意力。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The forest was much more alive than I'd ever known -- small creatures whose existence I'd never guessed at teemed in the leaves around me. They all grew silent after we passed, their breath quickening in fear. The animals had a much wiser reaction to our scent than humans seemed to. Certainly, it'd had the opposite effect on me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="森林像活过来了一样——各种细小的生物成堆成堆的生活在四周的每片树叶下。在我们经过的后，它们都变得沉默了，因为恐惧而呼吸加速。相对于人类来说，动物们似乎对我们的气味更加敏感。当然，这对我来说没有什么好处。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The wind of my speed blew my hair and my torn dress out behind me, and, though I knew it shouldn't, it felt warm against my skin. Just as the rough forest floor shouldn't feel like velvet beneath my bare soles, and the limbs that whipped against my skin shouldn't feel like caressing feathers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凉风吹起了我的头发，让裙裾在我身后飞扬，当它流过我的肌肤时我觉得是那么违背常理的温暖，森林粗糙的地面似乎不应该像天鹅绒般铺垫在我赤裸的脚下，更别说树叶锋利的边缘像羽毛般轻抚着我的肌肤。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I kept waiting to feel winded, but my breath came effortlessly. I waited for the burn to begin in my muscles, but my strength only seemed to increase as I grew accustomed to my stride. My leaping bounds stretched longer, and soon he was trying to keep up with me.

I couldn't get away from it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“在哪里？”我问，不耐烦的扫视着森林，试图忘记这种干渴，但是它似乎感染了我脑子里所有的思想，我试着去想开心的事，奔跑还有爱德华的嘴唇，爱德华的吻，还有……灼热的干渴。我就是不能摆脱它。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Everything, I could have said; his perfect voice, his breath, his lips brushing together as he spoke, the whisper of birds preening their feathers in the treetops, their fluttering heartbeats, the maple leaves scraping together, the faint clicking of ants following each other in a long line up the bark of the nearest tree. But I knew he meant something specific, so I let my ears range outward, seeking something different than the small hum of life that surrounded me. There was an open space near us -- the wind had a different sound across the exposed grass -- and a small creek, with a rocky bed. And there, near the noise of the water, was the splash of lapping tongues, the loud thudding of heavy hearts, pumping thick streams of blood…</div>

<div class="line_en">Mostly him -- his strange honey-lilac-and-sun perfume. But also the rich, earthy smell of rot and moss, the resin in the evergreens, the warm, almost nutty aroma of the small rodents cowering beneath the tree roots. And then, reaching out again, the clean smell of the water, which was surprisingly unappealing despite my thirst. I focused toward the water and found the scent that must have gone with the lapping noise and the pounding heart. Another warm smell, rich and tangy, stronger than the others. And yet nearly as unappealing as the brook. I wrinkled my nose.</div>

<div class="line_en">The scent ruled completely. I was single-minded as I traced it, aware only of the thirst and the smell that promised to quench it. The thirst got worse, so painful now that it confused all my other thoughts and began to remind me of the burn of venom in my veins.</div>

<div class="line_en">The vegetation thinned as we climbed higher; the scent of pitch and resin grew more powerful, as did the trail I followed -- it was a warm scent, sharper than the smell of the elk and more appealing. A few seconds more and I could hear the muted padding of immense feet, so much subtler than the crunch of hooves. The sound was up -- in the branches rather than on the ground. Automatically I darted into the boughs as well, gaining the strategic higher position, halfway up a towering silver fir.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当我们越爬越高后，植物变得稀疏起来。松香的味道变强烈了，我跟着气味的指引前进着——那种温暖的气味，比雄鹿的味道更强烈也更具有诱惑力。几秒后，我听见了一个大脚掌走路时才能发出的低哑的声音，比蹄子落地时哒哒的声音要小的多。那声音慢慢升高像是在爬树而不是在地上。我马上冲到更高的枝桠上，站在塔般的银杉的半腰处，从而获得战略上的制高点。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The soft thud of paws continued stealthily beneath me now; the rich scent was very close. My eyes pinpointed the movement linked with the sound, and I saw the tawny hide of the great cat slinking along the wide branch of a spruce just down and to the left of my perch. He was big -- easily four times my mass. His eyes were intent on the ground beneath; the cat hunted, too. I caught the smell of something smaller, bland next to the aroma of my prey, cowering in brush below the tree. The lion's tail twitched spasmodically as he prepared to spring.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那柔软的脚掌落地时发出的响声还在下面，但那强烈的气味离我很近了。我的眼睛紧紧的跟随着这声音的每一次移动，看见一只黄褐色的山狮小心翼翼的在我左边不远的云杉上移动。它体型非常大有我的四倍重，眼睛正盯着它身下的地面，原来它也在捕猎。接着我闻到我可爱的捕猎者旁边那微弱的颤抖的小动物的气味。山狮的尾巴抬起直立着，它准备扑过去了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">With a light bound, I sailed through the air and landed on the lion's branch. He felt the shiver of the wood and whirled, shrieking surprise and defiance. He clawed the space between us, his eyes bright with fury. Half-crazed with thirst, I ignored the exposed fangs and the hooked claws and launched myself at him, knocking us both to the forest floor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="轻轻一跳，我在空气中飘过落在刚才山狮等候时的树枝上。它马上感觉到树枝的抖动，飞快的转过头，发出惊讶的警告和威胁的尖叫声。他用爪子刨了下地，眼睛里满是愤怒，但我被那干渴的感觉刺激的半疯，完全忽略了它暴露在空气中的牙齿和尖锐的爪子，扑向它，把我们俩都撞倒在林地上。">查看中文翻译</div>

My jaws locked easily over the precise point where the heat flow concentrated.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="它尖锐的爪子狠狠的抓向我，我却只像被挠了一下；牙齿在我的肩膀和喉咙上找不到下嘴之处；庞大的身躯像是没有重量一样。我的牙齿准确无误的咬向它的喉咙，而它本能的挣扎在我的力量下毫无作用。我的下巴紧紧的锁定在它鲜血流淌的中心。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The flavor was wrong, but the blood was hot and wet and it soothed the ragged, itching thirst as I drank in an eager rush.
