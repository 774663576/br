<div class="line_en">I know any move I would make toward Darius, any act of recognition, would only result in punishment for him. So we just stare into each other's eyes. Darius, now a mute slave; me, now headed to death. What would we say, anyway? That we're sorry for the other's lot? That we ache for the other's pain? That we're glad we had the chance to know each other?</div>

<div class="line_en">No, Darius shouldn't be glad he knew me. If I had been there to stop Thread, he wouldn't have stepped forward to save Gale. Wouldn't be an Avox. And more specifically, wouldn't be my Avox, because President Snow has so obviously had him placed here for my benefit.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不，认识我，大流士不该高兴。如果我当时在场，去制止斯瑞德，那他就不必站出来救盖尔，不会成为艾瓦克斯，特别是不会成为我的艾瓦克斯。显然，斯诺总统是有意把他安排来服侍我的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Haymitch grips my wrist as if anticipating my next move, but I am as speechless as the Capitol's torturers have rendered Darius. Haymitch once told me they did something to Avoxes' tongues so they could never talk again. In my head I hear Darius's voice, playful and bright, ringing across the Hob to tease me. Not as my fellow victors make fun of me now, but because we genuinely liked each other. If Gale could see him…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黑密斯赶紧抓住我的手腕，好像料到我下一步要干什么。可我却保持沉默，就像遭受凯匹特折磨后的大流士一样。黑密斯曾告诉过我凯匹特人把艾瓦克斯的舌头割掉，这样他们就再也不能说话了。在我的心里，我仍能听到大流士的话语，轻松、顽皮，在霍伯市场跟我开玩笑逗我。他的玩笑和其他胜利者拿我寻开心不同，我们真诚地对待彼此。假如盖尔看到了他，又会怎么想呢…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When Effie eventually knocks on the door to summon me to dinner, I get up and take off my suit, fold it neatly, and set it on the table with my crown. In the bathroom, I wash the dark streaks of makeup from my face. I dress in a simple shirt and pants and go down the hall to the dining room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="艾菲终于来敲门叫我去吃饭，我站起身，脱掉衣服，把它叠整齐，和王冠一起放在桌子上。在浴室，我洗掉了脸上的一道道的浓妆，穿上朴素的衬衣、裤子，穿过大厅走向餐厅。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I'm not aware of much at dinner except that Darius and the redheaded Avox girl are our servers. Effie, Haymitch, Cinna, Portia, and Peeta are all there, talking about the opening ceremonies, I suppose. But the only time I really feel present is when I purposely knock a dish of peas to the floor and, before anyone can stop me, crouch down to clean them up. Darius is right by me when I send the dish over, and we two are briefly side by side, obscured from view, as we scoop up the peas. For just one moment our hands meet. I can feel his skin, rough under the buttery sauce from the dish. In the tight, desperate clench of our fingers are all the words we will never be able to say. Then Effie's clucking at me from behind about how "That isn't your job, Katniss!" and he lets go.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吃饭时，我心绪不宁，脑子里只想着我们的侍者，大流士和红发女孩。艾菲、黑密斯、西纳、波西娅、皮塔，所有的人都似乎在餐桌旁讨论着开幕式的事情。我故意将一盘豌豆打翻在地，趁着还没人拦我，我赶快弯下身去捡。吃饭时，我一直心不在焉，只有这个动作是有意识的。我打翻盘子的当儿，大流士就站在我身旁，在俯身捡豆子时，我们并排蹲在地上，但我没敢正眼看他。在一个短暂的瞬间，我们的手握在一起。菜里的黄油汁溅了他一手，我可以感觉到他的皮肤很粗糙。在我们不顾一切紧握着的手指间蕴含着一切未能吐露的话语。这时，我听到艾菲在我身后大声说：“这不是你该干的，凯特尼斯！”随即，他松开了我的手。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I twist my wrist from Haymitch's grasp and head down to my old bedroom, locking the door behind me. I sit on the side of my bed, elbows on my knees, forehead on my fists, and watch my glowing suit in the darkness, imagining I am in my old home in District 12, huddled beside the fire. It slowly fades back to black as the power pack dies out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我挣开黑密斯的手，跑回到我以前居住的房间，把门锁上。我坐在床边，胳膊肘支在膝盖上，用手托着前额，在幽暗的房间看着身上闪烁着光亮的衣服。我想象着自己正待在十二区的家中，蜷缩在壁炉旁。衣服上的光亮渐渐退去，直至电量全部用完，灯光消失为止。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When we go in to watch the recap of the opening cere-monies, I wedge myself in between Cinna and Haymitch on the couch because I don't want to be next to Peeta. This awfulness with Darius belongs to me and Gale and maybe even Haymitch, but not to Peeta. He might've known Darius to nod hello, but Peeta wasn't Hob the way the rest of us were. Besides, I'm still angry with him for laughing at me along with the other victors, and the last thing I want is his sympathy and comfort. I haven't changed my mind about saving him in the arena, but I don't owe him more than that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随后我们回到大厅，观看开幕式录像，我挤在西纳和黑密斯中间，因为我不想坐在皮塔身边。大流士的事让我难过，可这事属于盖尔和我，也许还有黑密斯，但却和皮塔无关。他也许认识大流士，已对他点头致意，但皮塔不像我们，在霍伯黑市混的人之间有着特殊的联系。另外，他和其他胜利者一起嘲笑我也让我生气，我最不需要别人的同情和安慰。我决计在竞技场保住他的想法没有变，可除此之外，我也不欠他什么。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As I watch the procession to the City Circle, I think how it's bad enough that they dress us all up in costumes and parade us through the streets in chariots on a regular year. Kids in costumes are silly, but aging victors, it turns out, are pitiful. A few who are on the younger side, like Johanna and Finnick, or whose bodies haven't fallen into disrepair, like Seeder and Brutus, can still manage to maintain a little dignity. But the majority, who are in the clutches of drink or morphling or illness, look grotesque in their costumes, depicting cows and trees and loaves of bread. Last year we chattered away about each contestant, but tonight there's only the occasional comment. Small wonder the crowd goes wild when Peeta and I appear, looking so young and strong and beautiful in our brilliant costumes. The very image of what tributes should be.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当我看到游行的彩车驶向城市广场的画面时，我觉得每年都让我们穿着彩装在街市穿行十分糟糕。如果说孩子们穿着彩装很傻的话，那么让年龄很大的胜利者穿着彩装则令人同情。一些稍微年轻些的人，例如约翰娜和芬尼克，或者一些形体没有发生太大变化的人，像希德尔和布鲁托，还没有失去尊严。可大多数人，那些毒品上瘾、疾病缠身的人，装扮成奶牛、大树、面包，就显得很怪异。去年我们仔细讨论每一个参赛者，而今年，仅有一两句简单的评论。难怪我和皮塔出现时人们会如此疯狂，因为我们穿上服装后显得那么的年轻、健美，符合选手应有的形象。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Soon after I go to bed, there's a quiet knock on my door, but I ignore it. I don't want Peeta tonight. Especially not with Darius around. It's almost as bad as if Gale were here. Gale. How am I supposed to let him go with Darius haunting the hallways?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我上床后不久，听到轻轻的敲门声，我没理睬。我今晚不想皮塔来，特别是在大流士就在附近的时候。这就跟盖尔在身边感觉差不多。噢，盖尔。大流士就在外面，我怎么可能不想起他呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tongues figure prominently in my nightmares. First I watch frozen and helpless while gloved hands carry out the bloody dissection in Darius's mouth. Then I'm at a party where everyone wears masks and someone with a flicking, wet tongue, who I suppose is Finnick, stalks me, but when he catches me and pulls off his mask, it's President Snow, and his puffy lips are dripping in bloody saliva. Finally I'm back in the arena, my own tongue as dry as sandpaper, while I try to reach a pool of water that recedes every time I'm about to touch it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我梦里出现的竟是舌头。大流土的舌头已经冻僵，不能动弹，一只戴胶皮手套的手把血淋淋的舌头从他嘴里取出来。之后，我来到一个晚会上，每个人都戴着面具，一些人的面具上有上下摆动的湿乎乎的舌头，一个人悄悄走近我，在梦中，我觉得这个人就是芬尼克，他抓住我并摘下面具，可出现在我面前的却是斯诺总统，他肥厚的嘴唇正滴着血红的口水。最后，我出现在竞技场，我的舌头干得像砂纸，想来到水塘边，可每当我快要靠近时，水塘却总是向后退去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As soon as it's over, I stand up and thank Cinna and Portia for their amazing work and head off to bed. Effie calls a reminder to meet early for breakfast to work out our training strategy, but even her voice sounds hollow. Poor Effie. She finally had a decent year in the Games with Peeta and me, and now it's all broken down into a mess that even she can't put a positive spin on. In Capitol terms, I'm guessing this counts as a true tragedy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="录像一结束，我就站起来，感谢西纳和波西娅所做的一切，然后我回到卧室，艾菲定了早叫醒服务，以便第二天早餐时大家碰头，商量训练计划。可即使艾菲的声音都显得空洞无力。可怜的艾菲。她终于遇到我和皮塔这样的好选手，露了把脸，可现在—切都乱成一团糟，她想都不敢往好处想。用凯匹特的话说，这就是真正的悲剧。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我从梦中醒来，跌跌撞撞地冲到盥洗室，对着水龙头狂喝，直到我再也喝不下去为止。我脱下浸满汗水的衣服，光着身子躺回到床上，迷迷糊糊地又睡着了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I delay going down to breakfast as long as possible the next morning because I really don't want to discuss our training strategy. What's to discuss? Every victor already knows what everybody else can do. Or used to be able to do, anyway. So Peeta and I will continue to act in love and that's that. Somehow I'm just not up to talking about it, especially with Darius standing mutely by. I take a long shower, dress slowly in the outfit Cinna has left for training, and order food from the menu in my room by speaking into a mouthpiece. In a minute, sausage, eggs, potatoes, bread, juice, and hot chocolate appear. I eat my fill, trying to drag out the minutes until ten o'clock, when we have to go down to the Training Center. By nine-thirty, Haymitch is pounding on my door, obviously fed up with me, ordering me to the dining room NOW! Still, I brush my teeth before meandering down the hall, effectively killing another five minutes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天早饭时我尽量拖着不想下楼，实在不想讨论训练计划了。有什么可讨论的？每一个胜利者都清楚其他人有什么技能，或者至少过去有什么技能。皮塔和我还要扮作恋人，不过尔尔。不知怎的，我就是不想谈论这些，特别是在哑然无声的大流士站在一旁时。我洗了个长长的澡，慢条斯理地穿上西纳为我准备的训练服，然后通过对讲话筒定了早餐。一分钟后，香肠、鸡蛋、土豆、面包、果汁和热巧克力送到了我的房间。我吃了个饱，一点点地消磨时间，想尽量拖到十点钟，这是我们到训练中心集合的时间。九点三十分，黑密斯砰砰地敲我的门，他显然已经等烦了。他命令我赶快到餐厅集合。马上！可是，我还是不慌不忙地刷了刷牙，之后才慢腾腾地来到大厅，又成功地拖延了五分钟。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The dining room's empty except for Peeta and Haymitch, whose face is flushed with drink and anger. On his wrist he wears a solid-gold bangle with a pattern of flames -- this must be his concession to Effie's matching-token plan -- that he twists unhappily. It's a very handsome bangle, really, but the movement makes it seem like something confining, a shackle, rather than a piece of jewelry. "You're late," he snarls at me.</div>

<div class="line_en">I tell Peeta I think we'd do best to split up, thus covering more territory. When he goes off to chuck spears with Brutus and Chaff, I head over to the knot-tying station. Hardly anyone ever bothers to visit it. I like the trainer and he remembers me fondly, maybe because I spent time with him last year. He's pleased when I show him I can still set the trap that leaves an enemy dangling by a leg from a tree. Clearly he took note of my snares in the arena last year and now sees me as an advanced pupil, so I ask him to review every kind of knot that might come in handy and a few that I'll probably never use. I'd be content to spend the morning alone with him, but after about an hour and a half, someone puts his arms around me from behind, his fingers easily finishing the complicated knot I've been sweating over. Of course it's Finnick, who seems to have spent his childhood doing nothing but wielding tridents and manipulating ropes into fancy knots for nets, I guess. I watch for a minute while he picks up a length of rope, makes a noose, and then pretends to hang himself for my amusement.</div>

<div class="line_en">The two tributes from District 3 are beside me, struggling to start a decent fire with matches. I think about leaving, but I really want to try using the flint again, and if I have to report back to Haymitch that I tried to make friends, these two might be a bearable choice. Both are small in stature with ashen skin and black hair. The woman, Wiress, is probably around my mother's age and speaks in a quiet, intelligent voice. But right away I notice she has a habit of dropping off her words in mid-sentence, as if she's forgotten you're there. Beetee, the man, is older and somewhat fidgety. He wears glasses but spends a lot of time looking under them. They're a little strange, but I'm pretty sure neither of them is going to try to make me uncomfortable by stripping naked. And they're from District 3. Maybe they can even confirm my suspicions of an uprising there.</div>

<div class="line_en">Rolling my eyes, I head over to another vacant station where tributes can learn to build fires. I already make excellent fires, but I'm still pretty dependent on matches for starting them. So the trainer has me work with flint, steel, and some charred cloth. This is much harder than it looks, and even working as intently as I can, it takes me about an hour to get a fire going. I look up with a triumphant smile only to find I have company.</div>

After lunch I do the edible-insect station with the District 8 tributes -- Cecelia, who's got three kids at home, and Woof, a really old guy who's hard of hearing and doesn't seem to know what's going on since he keeps trying to stuff poisonous bugs in his mouth. I wish I could mention meeting Twill and Bonnie in the woods, but I can't figure out how. Cashmere and Gloss, the sister and brother from District 1, invite me over and we make hammocks for a while. They're polite but cool, and I spend the whole time thinking about how I killed both the tributes from their district, Glimmer and Marvel, last year, and that they probably knew them and might even have been their mentors. Both my hammock and my attempt to connect with them are mediocre at best. I join Enobaria at sword training and exchange a few comments, but it's clear neither of us wants to team up. Finnick appears again when I'm picking up fishing tips, but mostly just to introduce me to Mags, the elderly woman who's also from District 4. Between her district accent and her garbled speech -- possibly she's had a stroke -- I can't make out more than one in four words. But I swear she can make a decent fishhook out of anything -- a thorn, a wishbone, an earring. After a while I tune out the trainer and simply try to copy whatever Mags does. When I make a pretty good hook out of a bent nail and fasten it to some strands of my hair, she gives me a toothless smile and an unintelligible comment I think might be praise. Suddenly I remember how she volunteered to replace the young, hysterical woman in her district. It couldn't be because she thought she had any chance of winning. She did it to save the girl, just like I volunteered last year to save Prim. And I decide I want her on my team.</div>

<div class="line_en">So I give up trying to make friends and go over to the archery range for some sanity. It's wonderful there, getting to try out all the different bows and arrows. The trainer, Tax, seeing that the standing targets offer no challenge for me, begins to launch these silly fake birds high into the air for me to hit. At first it seems stupid, but it turns out to be kind of fun. Much more like hunting a moving creature. Since I'm hitting everything he throws up, he starts increasing the number of birds he sends airborne. I forget the rest of the gym and the victors and how miserable I am and lose myself in the shooting. When I manage to take down five birds in one round, I realize it's so quiet I can hear each one hit the floor. I turn and see the majority of the victors have stopped to watch me.

<div class="line_en">After my shooting exhibition, I still get teased some, but I no longer feel like I'm being mocked. In fact, I feel as if I've somehow been initiated into the victors' circle. During the next two days, I spend time with almost everybody headed for the arena. Even the morphlings, who, with Peeta's help, paint me into a field of yellow flowers. Even Finnick, who gives me an hour of trident lessons in exchange for an hour of archery instruction. And the more I come to know these people, the worse it is. Because, on the whole, I don't hate them. And some I like. And a lot of them are so damaged that my natural instinct would be to protect them. But all of them must die if I'm to save Peeta.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在我射箭表演之后，还时不时会有人拿我调侃，但我已经不觉得那是讽刺了，事实上，我觉得自己已经开始被列入胜利者的小圈子。在接下来的两天里，我几乎和所有的选手都有接触，甚至吗啡瘾君子。他们和皮塔一起，把我画成了田野里黄色的花朵，甚至芬尼克也花了一小时教我使用鱼叉，作为交换，我也用了一小时教他箭术。而我对这些人的了解越深入，情况就越糟。因为，总的来说，我不讨厌他们，有些人我挺喜欢，而多数人自身情况很糟，甚至激发了我要保护他们的本能。但是，要想救皮塔，他们都不得不毙命。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As the girl from 12, I'm scheduled to go last. The dining room gets quieter and quieter as the tributes file out to go perform. It's easier to keep up the irreverent, invincible manner we've all adopted when there are more of us. As people disappear through the door, all I can think is that they have a matter of days to live.</div>

<div class="line_en">The final day of training ends with our private sessions. We each get fifteen minutes before the Gamemakers to amaze them with our skills, but I don't know what any of us might have to show them. There's a lot of kidding about it at lunch. What we might do. Sing, dance, strip, tell jokes. Mags, who I can understand a little better now, decides she's just going to take a nap. I don't know what I'm going to do. Shoot some arrows, I guess. Haymitch said to surprise them if we could, but I'm fresh out of ideas.</div>

<div class="line_en">I try to catch Plutarch Heavensbee's eye, but he seems to be intentionally ignoring me, as he has the entire training period. I remember how he sought me out for a dance, how pleased he was to show me the mockingjay on his watch. His friendly manner has no place here. How could it, when I'm a mere tribute and he's the Head Gamemaker? So powerful, so removed, so safe…</div>

<div class="line_en">Suddenly I know just what I'm going to do. Something that will blow anything Peeta did right out of the water. I go over to the knot-tying station and get a length of rope. I start to manipulate it, but it's hard because I've never made this actual knot myself. I've only watched Finnick's clever fingers, and they moved so fast. After about ten minutes, I've come up with a respectable noose. I drag one of the target dummies out into the middle of the room and, using some chinning bars, hang it so it dangles by the neck. Tying its hands behind its back would be a nice touch, but I think I might be running out of time. I hurry over to the camouflage station, where some of the other tributes, undoubtedly the morphlings, have made a colossal mess. But I find a partial container of bloodred berry juice that will serve my needs. The flesh-colored fabric of the dummy's skin makes a good, absorbent canvas. I carefully finger paint the words on its body, concealing them from view. Then I step away quickly to watch the reaction on the Gamemakers' faces as they read the name on the dummy. SENECA CRANE.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然，我有了主意。只要我这么做，无论皮塔做了什么大逆不道之事，都是小巫见大巫，我也就可以救他于水火之中。我走到结绳训练站，拿起一截绳索，打起了绳结。以前只看过芬尼克灵巧的手指快速地弄过，而我没打过这种结，所以挺费力气。大约十分钟之后，我把绳结打好了，还可以。我把假人拖到场地中央，借助双杠，把它从脖子那吊起来。如果能把假人的手反剪效果更好，可我想时间恐怕不够了。我又快速跑到迷彩训练站。看来这里有人来过，肯定是吗啡瘾君子，他们把这里弄得一团糟。我我到一个坛子，里面盛着血红的浆果汁。我用手指蘸上果汁，小心翼翼地把字写在假人身上，同时用身体遮住不让评委看到，包裹假人的肉色的布料很吸水，字很好写…写好后，我快速走开，然后观察评委们的反应。假人的身上写着：塞内卡，克林。">查看中文翻译</div>
