<div class="line_en">He went into the maze once, to show a friend the way. He had studied a map of the maze, and so he knew it was very easy to get out of it again. Harris said to his friend,'We'll just go in and walk around for ten minutes, and then we'll come out and get some lunch. It's easy, you see. You just keep taking the first turning to the right.

<div class="line_en">At Kingston our boat was waiting for us. Harris and I put all our things into it, and we moved off along the River Thames. Montmorency was at the front of the boat. We travelled along the river without any accidents. Well, there was only one little accident. That was when the boat hit the river bank, and Harris fell over backwards. When we came to Hampton Court Palace, Harris asked me if I had ever been in the maze there. He told me a story about it…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="船在金斯顿等我们。哈里斯和我把行李搬上船，然后沿着泰晤士河出发了，“元帅”站在船头。一路上没有什么意外。嗯，只有一个小小的意外：小船撞到了岸上，哈里斯仰面摔了一跤。当我们经过汉普顿宫，哈里斯问我有没有到过那里的迷宫，还给我讲起以前的故事……">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As they were going along, they collected other people who wanted to get out. In the end, all the people in the maze were following Harris. There were about twenty of them. Some of them had thought that they were never going to see their friends and their families again. One woman was carrying a baby. She held on to Harris's arm because she did not want to lose him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们一边绕，一路上又带上了不少人，也是想走出迷宫的。后来迷宫里所有的人都跟着哈里斯走，至少有二十人，其中有的人甚至担心今生今世再也见不到自己的朋友和家人了。一个妇女抱着孩子，紧紧揪着哈里斯的胳膊，生怕把他丢了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After that, every time they tried again, they arrived back in the centre. Harris took out his map again, but this made the crowd angry. They told him what to do with his map. Harris felt that the crowd was not very grateful to him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后来，每一次努力都是以回到迷宫的中心而告终。哈里斯又拿出地图来看，这下子大家全火了，他们叫他拿了这幅地图见鬼去吧！哈里斯觉得这群人真不知道感恩戴德。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But he was a young keeper, and he was new to the job, so when he got into the maze, he could not find them. Then he got lost. From time to time, they saw him as he ran past, on the other side of the hedge. He shouted,'Wait there! I'm coming!'</div>
