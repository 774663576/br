<div class="line_en">After the talk with the man from the Ministry, Tomas fell into a deep depression. How could he have gone along with the jovial tone of the conversation? If he hadn't refused to have anything at all to do with the man (he was not prepared for what happened and did not know what was condoned by law and what was not), he could at least have refused to drink wine with him as if they were friends! Supposing someone had seen him, someone who knew the man.</div>

<div class="line_en">He could only have inferred that Tomas was working with the police! And why did he even tell him that the article had been cut? Why did he throw in that piece of information? He was extremely displeased with himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那他一定会认为托马斯是警方的耳目！为什么要跟这警察说他的文章被砍了呢！根本没有道理嘛，为什么要告诉他这一情况？他对自己深为不满。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Two weeks later, the man from the Ministry paid him another visit. Once more he invited him out for a drink, but this time Tomas requested that they stay in his office.</div>

<div class="line_en">Whether you meant to or not, you fanned the flames of anti-Communist hysteria with your article. I must tell you there was even a proposal to take you to court for that article. There's a law against public incitement to violence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无论是您有意还是无意，您那篇文章正好为反共的歇斯底里助了力。我就不相瞒了，已经有人向我们提出，因为您那篇文章，要把您送上法庭，法律中就有那么一条，叫公开煽动暴力罪。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The man from the Ministry of the Interior paused to look Tomas in the eye. Tomas shrugged his shoulders. The man assumed his comforting tone again. We voted down the proposal. No matter what your responsibility in the affair, society has an interest in seeing you use your abilities to the utmost. The chief surgeon of your hospital speaks very highly of you. We have reports from your patients as well. You are a fine specialist. Nobody requires a doctor to understand politics. You let yourself be carried away. It's high time we settled this thing once and for all. That's why we've put together a sample statement for you. All you have to do is make it available to the press, and we'll make sure it comes out at the proper time. He handed Tomas a piece of paper.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="内务部的人说完停了一下，盯着托马斯的眼睛。托马斯耸耸肩。那人又以安慰的口吻说：“当然我们没有接受这个主意。无论您的责任有多大，社会都需要您待在能让您发挥才能的位置上。您以前的那个主任非常器重您。我们还找您的病人做了调查，您是位非常了不起的专家，大夫！谁也不能非要求医生懂政治，您是被人愚弄了，大夫。必须想个办法弥补。所以我们给您草拟了个声明，我们觉得您应该把它交给媒体。然后，我们会尽可能让它在适当的时候刊登。”说着，他将一张纸递给了托马斯。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They sat opposite each other, Tomas at his desk. After about ten minutes, during which they talked about the flu epidemic raging at the time, the man said, We've given your case a lot of thought. If we were the only ones involved, there would be nothing to it. But we have public opinion to take into account.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们面对面地，各自坐在一张椅子上，中间隔着托马斯的桌子。开始十分钟，他们只聊流感的事，说到处都在闹流感，然后，那人换了话题，说：“我们已经研究了您的情况，大夫，如果不是您，那么事情就简单多了。不过我们必须考虑到公众舆论。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tomas read what was in it and panicked. It was much worse than what the chief surgeon had asked him to sign two years before. It did not stop at a retraction of the Oedipus article. It contained words of love for the Soviet Union, vows of fidelity to the Communist Party; it condemned the intelligentsia, which wanted to push the country into civil war; and, above all, it denounced the editors of the writers' weekly (with special emphasis on the tall, stooped editor; Tomas had never met him, though he knew his name and had seen pictures of him), who had consciously distorted his article and used it for their own devices, turning it into a call for counterrevolution: too cowardly to write such an article themselves, they had hid behind a naive doctor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="托马斯看了上面写的，猛吃一惊。这比两年前主任要他写的那份东西糟糕得多！纸上所写的，再不只是关于收回关于俄狄浦斯一文的声明，还有热爱苏联以及忠于共产党等等句子，上面还有对某些知识分子的谴责，说他们一心想将国家引入内战，尤其是对作家周刊编辑部和那个背有点驼的记者（托马斯从没跟他说过话，只是见过他的名字和照片）的揭发，说他有意欺骗作者，篡改作者文章的意思，把文章改成一篇反革命宣言；上面还写道，那些人都太怯懦，不敢自己站出来写那样的文章，于是就存心把一个天真幼稚的大夫当挡箭牌。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The man from the Ministry saw the panic in Tomas's eyes. He leaned over and gave his knee a friendly pat under the table. Remember now, Doctor, it's only a sample! Think it over, and if there's something you want to change, I'm sure we can come to an agreement. After all, it's your statement!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="内务部的人看出了托马斯眼中的惊恐。他向前探了探身子，很友善地拍了拍桌子下面托马斯的膝盖，说道：“大夫，这不过是草稿！您可以考虑一下，如果想换个方式什么的，也未尝不可，完全可以再商量。说到底，这是您的文字！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Very well, then, Doctor. Let's do it your way. You write it up yourself, and we'll go over it together. You can use what you've just read as a model.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tomas held the paper out to the secret policeman as if he were afraid to keep it in his hands another second, as if he were worried someone would find his fingerprints on it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="托马斯立刻把纸片递给警察，好像害怕多留在手中一秒钟似的。他几乎已经想象着人们会在纸上发现他的指纹。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tomas was on the point of telling him emphatically that he would neither write nor sign any text whatever, but at the last moment he changed his tone and said mildly, I'm no illiterate, am I? Why should I sign something I didn't write myself?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="托马斯想跟他斩钉截铁，把话挑明，绝不会写一个字，也绝不会在纸上签名。不过话临出口前，他还是改了语气，平静地说：“我又不是文盲。为什么非要在不是我写的东西上签名？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But instead of taking the paper, the man from the Ministry spread his arms in feigned amazement (the same gesture the Pope uses to bless the crowds from his balcony). Now why do a thing like that, Doctor? Keep it. Think it over calmly at home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="内务部的人没有伸手去接，而是张开双臂，装作很吃惊的样子（就像教皇站在阳台上为子民祝福时一般），说：“可是，大夫，为什么要把它还给我呢？得留下。回家去再好好考虑一下。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tomas shook his head and patiently held the paper in his outstretched hand. In the end, the man from the Ministry was forced to abandon his papal gesture and take the paper back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="托马斯摇摇头，仍然耐着性子伸着手，手里捏着那张纸片。内务部的人终于不再做出一副教皇祝福子民的模样，作了让步，接过纸片。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">No newspaper would dare publish his denial. No one in the world would believe that he hadn't written or signed it. People derived too much pleasure from seeing their fellow man morally humiliated to spoil that pleasure by hearing out an explanation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到时不会有报纸再刊登他的否认声明！再也不会有人相信托马斯没有写过那篇文章，没有在声明上签过字！他已经很清楚人们的心理，他们从别人的精神耻辱中得到无比的快乐，根本不愿意有什么解释来糟蹋这份快乐。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">By giving the police the hope that he would write a text of his own, he gained a bit of time. The very next day he resigned from the clinic, assuming (correctly) that after he had descended voluntarily to the lowest rung of the social ladder (a descent being made by thousands of intellectuals in other fields at the time), the police would have no more hold over him and he would cease to interest them. Once he had reached the lowest rung on the ladder, they would no longer be able to publish a statement in his name, for the simple reason that no one would accept it as genuine. Humiliating public statements are associated exclusively with the signatories' rise, not fall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是托马斯给警方一丝希望，表示自己去写声明，以此争取时间。第二天，他就开始着手写辞职信。他设想（设想得很正确）自己一旦自愿沦落到社会最底层（那时已有别的学科成千上万的知识分子都降到了社会最底层），警察就再也不会抓着他不放，不会再对他有什么兴趣。那样的话，他们便不会去发表所谓由他自己签名的声明，也绝对不会有人相信。谁发表这种无耻的公开声明只会高升，而不是沦落。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This is what probably went through his head: Besides using a statement like that to demoralize the nation in general (which is clearly the Russian strategy), the police could have a concrete goal in his case: they might be gathering evidence for a trial against the editors of the weekly that had published Tomas's article. If that was so, they would need his statement for the hearing and for the smear campaign the press would conduct against them. Were he to refuse flatly, on principle, there was always the danger that the police would print the prepared statement over his signature, whether he gave his consent or not.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他很快作出了推断：这样的声明除了用来灭整个民族的志气（这也正是俄国人的基本战略发展方向），警察在他的这个案子上恐怕还有更明确的目的：也许他们正准备对托马斯寄去文章的那家周刊的记者提起公诉。在这种情况下，托马斯的声明便成了他们的一项证据，他们可以用来发动新闻媒体的攻势来整那些记者。如果托马斯当场就断然拒绝，他就面临危险，警方就有可能把他们早就准备好的声明加上托马斯的假签名刊登出来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But in Tomas's country, doctors are state employees, and the state may or may not release them from its service. The official with whom Tomas negotiated his resignation knew him by name and reputation and tried to talk him into staying on. Tomas suddenly realized that he was not at all sure he had made the proper choice, but he felt bound to it by then by an unspoken vow of fidelity, so he stood fast. And that is how he became a window washer.</div>
