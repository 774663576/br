<div class="line_en">When he left the Athelnys' Philip walked down Chancery Lane and along the Strand to get a 'bus at the top of Parliament Street. One Sunday, when he had known them about six weeks, he did this as usual, but he found the Kennington 'bus full. It was June, but it had rained during the day and the night was raw and cold. He walked up to Piccadilly Circus in order to get a seat; the 'bus waited at the fountain, and when it arrived there seldom had more than two or three people in it. This service ran every quarter of an hour, and he had some time to wait. He looked idly at the crowd. The public-houses were closing, and there were many people about. His mind was busy with the ideas Athelny had the charming gift of suggesting.</div>

<div class="line_en">Suddenly his heart stood still. He saw Mildred. He had not thought of her for weeks. She was crossing over from the corner of Shaftesbury Avenue and stopped at the shelter till a string of cabs passed by. She was watching her opportunity and had no eyes for anything else. She wore a large black straw hat with a mass of feathers on it and a black silk dress; at that time it was fashionable for women to wear trains; the road was clear, and Mildred crossed, her skirt trailing on the ground, and walked down Piccadilly. Philip, his heart beating excitedly, followed her. He did not wish to speak to her, but he wondered where she was going at that hour; he wanted to get a look at her face. She walked slowly along and turned down Air Street and so got through into Regent Street. She walked up again towards the Circus. Philip was puzzled. He could not make out what she was doing. Perhaps she was waiting for somebody, and he felt a great curiosity to know who it was. She overtook a short man in a bowler hat, who was strolling very slowly in the same direction as herself; she gave him a sidelong glance as she passed. She walked a few steps more till she came to Swan and Edgar's, then stopped and waited, facing the road. When the man came up she smiled. The man stared at her for a moment, turned away his head, and sauntered on. Then Philip understood.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="忽然，他的一颗心猛地提了起来。他看到了米尔德里德。有好几个礼拜的时间他都没有想过她了。米尔德里德正从沙夫茨伯里大道的一角准备过马路，她站在避雨棚下，等着马车驶过。她准备一有机会就跑过马路，完全没注意别的。她戴着一顶宽大的黑色草帽，插着很多羽毛；穿了件黑色丝裙（带裙摆的裙子很是时髦）。路上没车了，米尔德里德裙摆曳地，缓缓而过，往皮卡迪利走去。菲利普的心怦怦乱跳，紧跟在她身后。他并不想上前搭话，只是想再看一眼她的脸，想看看都这么晚了，她究竟要到哪里去。她沿着道边慢慢地走，拐进艾尔街，又一路走到摄政街，继续朝马戏团的方向前进。菲利普有点迷糊了，搞不懂她这是在做什么。也许她在等着什么人吧。他很好奇这个人究竟是谁。前头有个个子矮矮的男人，戴了顶圆顶礼貌，走得很慢。她赶上他，从他身边经过的时候侧头看了看他。又走了几步，到了斯旺德加商店的大门口，面朝大街等了片刻，一有男人经过就抛出个媚笑。有个男人盯着她看了一会儿，然后把脸转过去，慢悠悠地走开了。菲利普忽然明白了这是怎么一回事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They were the first words either of them had spoken since getting into the cab. They walked a few yards and Mildred knocked three times, sharply, at a door. Philip noticed in the fanlight a cardboard on which was an announcement that apartments were to let. The door was opened quietly, and an elderly, tall woman let them in. She gave Philip a stare and then spoke to Mildred in an undertone. Mildred led Philip along a passage to a room at the back. It was quite dark; she asked him for a match, and lit the gas; there was no globe, and the gas flared shrilly. Philip saw that he was in a dingy little bed-room with a suite of furniture, painted to look like pine much too large for it; the lace curtains were very dirty; the grate was hidden by a large paper fan. Mildred sank on the chair which stood by the side of the chimney-piece. Philip sat on the edge of the bed. He felt ashamed. He saw now that Mildred's cheeks were thick with rouge, her eyebrows were blackened; but she looked thin and ill, and the red on her cheeks exaggerated the greenish pallor of her skin. She stared at the paper fan in a listless fashion. Philip could not think what to say, and he had a choking in his throat as if he were going to cry. He covered his eyes with his hands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="上了马车，两个人就再没说过一句。走了几步路，到一扇门前，米尔德里德重重敲了三下。菲利普看见房子的气窗上有块写着招租启事的板子。门静静打开，一个上了年纪的高个儿女人请他们进屋。她瞅了菲利普一眼，压低声音和米尔德里德嘀咕两句。米尔德里德带着菲利普穿过走廊，来到一间朝阴的房间。屋里伸手不见五指，她跟菲利普要了根火柴，点着汽灯。灯上没有玻璃罩，火光烧得很旺。菲利普四下看了看。这是间脏兮兮的小卧室，里面有一套家具，刷成松木的颜色，和狭小的房间比起来未免有点太大。带花边的窗帘脏得要命，一把大纸扇子堵着壁炉口。米尔德里德往壁炉架旁边的扶手椅上一坐，身子整个儿陷了进去。菲利普坐在床沿，尴尬得手都不知道往哪搁。他现在能清楚地看到米尔德里德的脸：两颊涂了厚厚的胭脂，眉毛描得乌黑，看上去干瘦干瘦，像生过一场重病。胭脂的红反倒衬得皮肤更加发青。她没精打采地看着那把纸扇子。菲利普想不出说些什么，嗓子好像被哽住了，眼泪随时都要夺眶而出。他拿手捂住眼睛。">查看中文翻译</div>
