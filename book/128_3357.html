<div class="line_en">It was too late to call up for a cab or anything, so I walked the whole way to the station. It wasn't too far, but it was cold as hell, and the snow made it hard for walking, and my Gladstones kept banging hell out of my legs. I sort of enjoyed the air and all, though. The only trouble was, the cold made my nose hurt, and right under my upper lip, where old Stradlater'd laid one on me. He'd smacked my lip right on my teeth, and it was pretty sore. My ears were nice and warm, though. That hat I bought had earlaps in it, and I put them on -- I didn't give a damn how I looked. Nobody was around anyway. Everybody was in the sack.</div>

<div class="line_en">I was quite lucky when I got to the station, because I only had to wait about ten minutes for a train. While I waited, I got some snow in my hand and washed my face with it. I still had quite a bit of blood on.</div>

<div class="line_en">Usually I like riding on trains, especially at night, with the lights on and the windows so black, and one of those guys coming up the aisle selling coffee and sandwiches and magazines. I usually buy a ham sandwich and about four magazines. If I'm on a train at night, I can usually even read one of those dumb stories in a magazine without puking. You know. One of those stories with a lot of phony, lean-jawed guys named David in it, and a lot of phony girls named Linda or Marcia that are always lighting all the goddam Davids' pipes for them. I can even read one of those lousy stories on a train at night, usually. But this time, it was different. I just didn't feel like it. I just sort of sat and not did anything. All I did was take off my hunting hat and put it in my pocket.</div>

<div class="line_en">All of a sudden, this lady got on at Trenton and sat down next to me. Practically the whole car was empty, because it was pretty late and all, but she sat down next to me, instead of an empty seat, because she had this big bag with her and I was sitting in the front seat. She stuck the bag right out in the middle of the aisle, where the conductor and everybody could trip over it. She had these orchids on, like she'd just been to a big party or something. She was around forty or forty-five, I guess, but she was very good-looking. Women kill me. They really do. I don't mean I'm oversexed or anything like that -- although I am quite sexy. I just like them, I mean. They're always leaving their goddam bags out in the middle of the aisle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一霎时，有位太太从特兰敦上来，坐在我身旁。几乎整个车厢都空着，因为时间已经很晚，可她不去独坐个空位置，却一径坐到我身旁，原因是她带着一只大旅行袋，我又正好占着前面座位。她把那只旅行袋往过道中央一放，也不管列车员或者什么人走过都可能绊一交。她身上戴着兰花，好象刚赴了什么重大宴会出来。她年纪约在四十到四十五左右，我揣摩，可她长得十分漂亮。女人能要我的命。她们的确能。我并不是说我这人有色情狂之类的毛病――虽然我倒是十分好色。我只是喜欢女人，我是说。她们老是把她们的混帐旅行袋放在过道中央。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Anyway, we were sitting there, and all of a sudden she said to me, "Excuse me, but isn't that a Pencey Prep sticker?" She was looking up at my suitcases, up on the rack.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="嗯，我们这么坐着，忽然她对我说：“对不起，这不是一张潘西中学的签条吗？”她正拿眼望着上面行李架上我的两只手提箱。">查看中文翻译</div>

She said their house was right on the beach, and they had a tennis court and all, but I just thanked her and told her I was going to South America with my grandmother.
