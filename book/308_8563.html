<div class="line_en">A strange end to my manuscript. I meant it to be published some day as the history of one of Poirot's failures!</div>

<div class="line_en">All along I've had a premonition of disaster, from the moment I saw Ralph Paton and Mrs Ferrars with their heads together. I thought then that she was confiding in him, as it happened I was quite wrong there, but the idea persisted even after I went into the study with Ackroyd that night, until he told me the truth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="自从看见拉尔夫·佩顿和弗拉尔斯太太并肩走在一起那一刻开始，我就有大难临头的预感。当时我以为她正对他推心置腹，后来才知道根本不是这么回事。但那天晚上和艾克罗伊德一起走进书房时，我脑海中依然盘旋着这个念头，直至他告诉我实情时才明白过来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The dagger was an afterthought. I'd brought up a very handy little weapon of my own, but when I saw the dagger lying in the silver table, it occurred to me at once how much better it would be to use a weapon that couldn't be traced to me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一开始我没打算用那柄短剑，当时我已携带了一把非常轻便的凶器。但一看到银桌里躺着的那柄短剑时，我立刻想到，如果使用无法追查到我头上的凶器，自然是上上之策。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Or let me be honest -- didn't I subconsciously realize that with a pig-headed chap like him, it was my best chance of getting him not to read it? His nervousness that night was interesting psychologically. He knew danger was close at hand. And yet he never suspected me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="或者坦白说，可能是潜意识在提醒我，像他那种老顽固，越催他读，他就越不肯读。从心理学角度剖析当晚他的紧张情绪，倒是很有意思。他明明知道危险近在眼前，却从未怀疑到我头上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Poor old Ackroyd. I'm always glad that I gave him a chance. I urged him to read that letter before it was too late.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可怜的老艾克罗伊德。我一直很高兴毕竟还给过他一次机会。我催促他赶紧把信读完，否则一定会后悔。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I suppose I must have meant to murder him all along. As soon as I heard of Mrs Ferrars's death, I felt convinced that she would have told him everything before she died. When I met him and he seemed so agitated, I thought that perhaps he knew the truth, but that he couldn't bring himself to believe it, and was going to give me the chance of refuting it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我早已计划除掉艾克罗伊德。一听到弗拉尔斯太太的死讯，我便相信她死前肯定已经将一切都告诉了艾克罗伊德。遇到他的时候，见他焦躁不安，我还以为他已经获悉真相，只是不敢相信，准备给我一次申辩的机会而已。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I am rather pleased with myself as a writer. What could be neater, for instance, than the following: "The letters were brought in at twenty minutes to nine. It was just on ten minutes to nine when I left him, the letter still unread. I hesitated with my hand on the door handle, looking back and wondering if there was anything I had left undone."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我对自己的写作功力相当满意。比如下面这个段落写得就特别聪明：信是八点四十分送进来的。而当我八点五十分离开他的时候，那封信仍然没读完。我的手搭在门把上，彷徨不定，回头望了望，寻思着是否还有什么事情没处理。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So I went home and took my precautions. If the trouble were after all only something to do with Ralph -- well, no harm would have been done. The dictaphone he had given me two days ago to adjust. Something had gone a little wrong with it, and I persuaded him to let me have a go at it, instead of sending it back. I did what I wanted to, and took it up with me in my bag that evening.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是我回家之后就做了种种准备。如果他焦躁的原因只不过是拉尔夫的事情——唔，那做点准备也不会有害处。两天之前，艾克罗伊德的口述录音机出了点小毛病，我劝他先让我试着修一修，没用的话再退货。我在录音机上做了点儿手脚，那天晚上就藏在包里带去了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I must admit that it gave me rather a shock to run into Parker just outside the door. I have faithfully recorded that fact.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不得不承认，在门口撞上帕克，真是吓得我魂飞魄散。这一事实我也如实记录下来了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">All true, you see. But suppose I had put a row of stars after the first sentence! Would somebody then have wondered what exactly happened in that blank ten minutes?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看见没有，全是实话。但如果我在第一句话后面加上一个省略号呢？有人怀疑过那十分钟空白时间里发生了什么吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When I looked round the room from the door, I was quite satisfied. Nothing had been left undone. The dictaphone was on the table by the window, timed to go off at ninethirty (the mechanism of that little device was rather clever -- based on the principle of an alarm clock), and the armchair was pulled out so as to hide it from the door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当我从门口回望书房时，心中十分满意。该办的都办妥了。口述录音机放在窗前的桌子上，时间定为九点半（那小小的机械装置十分巧妙，是根据闹钟的原理制成的），我还把扶手椅拖了出来，这样从门口就看不到口述录音机了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then later, when the body was discovered, and I sent Parker to telephone for the police, what a judicious use of words: "I did what little had to be done!" It was quite little just to shove the dictaphone into my bag and push back the chair against the wall in its proper place. I never dreamed that Parker would have noticed that chair. Logically, he ought to have been so agog over the body as to be blind to everything else. But I hadn't reckoned with the trained servant complex.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后来，发现尸体后，我派帕克去打电话报警。此处我在手稿中的用词十分严谨：“我做了点非做不可的小事。”的确是小事——只是把口述录音机藏进包里，将椅子推回墙边原来的位置而已。我做梦也没想到帕克竟会注意到椅子的位置。从逻辑上说，发现尸体后的震惊和慌乱，应该令他无暇顾及其他东西才对。但我忽略了训练有素的仆人所拥有的本能反应，实属失策。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">My greatest fear all through has been Caroline. I have fancied she might guess. Curious the way she spoke that day of my "strain of weakness."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="她的话彻底把我搞蒙了。事实上，整个案子从头到尾层出不穷的种种谜团几乎令我绝望。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="那么就让安眠药为一切画上句号吧。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And then -- what shall it be? Veronal? There would be a kind of poetic justice. Not that I take any responsibility for Mrs Ferrars's death. It was the direct consequence of her own actions. I feel no pity for her.</div>
