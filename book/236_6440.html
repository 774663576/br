<div class="line_en">It was already seven o'clock in the evening, and there was a freezing wind. Molly did not know she was very near Raveloe. Her legs were tired and the gin was beginning to make her feel sleepy. She thought she would rest for a while, and, still holding her child, she lay down on the snow. She did not notice that the ground was cold.</div>

<div class="line_en">For some time now she had planned to come to Raveloe on New Year's Eve. She knew that her husband would be at the centre of a happy, smiling group of friends, and she had chosen this moment to appear in front of all his family and guests at the Red House dance. "I don't care if Godfrey is ashamed of mes!" she thought bitterly. "I want people to know we're married!" sometimes she hated her husband, because he was still handsome, and had money, while she was no longer pretty, and very poor. She blamed him for her miserable life, but in her heart she knew she should blame her drinking. It had become a habit with her to spend most of the money Godfrey gave her on gin. She had a bottle in her pocket now, which she had lifted to her lips several times during her journey.</div>

<div class="line_en">In a few moments the child woke up, crying, "Mummy!" But the mother did not seem to hear. Suddenly, as the child fell gently out of its mother's arms on to the soft snow, it noticed a bright, dancing light on the white ground. Interested, the child stood up to see where the brightness came from, and followed the light to an open door, the door of Silas Marner's cottage. The little one toddled right in through the door and sat down by the bright fire. After a few minutes the child felt pleasantly warm, and fell asleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一会儿孩子醒了，开始哭着喊妈妈。可妈妈好像没有听见。孩子从妈妈的臂中滑落到松软的雪地上时，忽然看到白白的雪地上跳动着一点小小的亮光。出于好奇，孩子站起来想看看光是从哪儿来的。向着亮光，孩子走进了一扇开着的门，这是西拉斯·马南的小草屋。小家伙蹒跚着直进门里走到明亮的炉火前坐下。没过几分钟，孩子暖和过来，甜甜地睡着了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But where was Silas while this was happening? In the evenings he sometimes used to open his door and look out. He had some idea that his money would come back, or that some-one would come with information about the thief Tonight was New Year's Eve, and the villagers had told him to stay awake until midnight, because it would bring him good luck if he saw the beginning of the new year. So tonight he was more restless than usual. He opened his door several times during the evening, and stared out, but he saw and heard nothing in the silent, freezing night. The last time, as he was standing at the door, he had one of his fits, and stood there completely unconscious, holding the door open.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时西拉斯在哪儿呢？他晚上有时会打开门看看外面，总觉得有一天他的金子会回来，或者什么人会给他带来关于贼的消息。今晚是新年夜，村里人告诉他今天午夜前不要睡觉，因为看着新的一年到来会给人带来好运。所以今晚他比平时更坐立不安。他几次打开门向外面看，可是在这个静静的寒冷的冬夜，他什么也看不见，什么也听不见。最后一次站到门口的时候，他又犯病了，站在那儿完全失去了知觉。门开着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Just then the child woke up, and began to cry. Silas held it in his arms, and spoke softly to quieten it. He remembered that he had made some porridge earlier, and gave a little to the child to eat. She stopped crying, and lifted her blue eyes with a smile to Silas's face as she ate. But then she pulled at her wet shoes, trying to take them off, and Silas suddenly realized she had come to the cottage through the snow. So he picked her up and went to the door. As he opened it and went out into the dark, the child cried"Mummy!"and reached forward, almost jumping out of his arms. A few steps away, Silas found a young woman's body, half-covered with snow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时候孩子醒了，开始哭。西拉斯把孩子抱在怀里，轻声地哄着。他想起来自己做的麦片粥，就拿出来喂孩子。孩子不再哭了，一边吃一边抬起蓝眼睛看着西拉斯的脸甜甜地笑。当她使劲想把那双湿湿的鞋子拽掉时，西拉斯想到她一定是从雪里走来的，于是就抱着孩子走向屋门。他打开门走进黑暗中时，孩子喊着妈妈向前挣去，险些从西拉斯的胳膊里跳到地上。几步之外，西拉斯看见一个半埋在雪里的年轻女人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When he became conscious again, he closed the door and turned back to the fire. But when his shortsighted eyes looked at the floor in front of the fire, he seemed to see gold there! Gold -- his own gold -- taken and then brought back to him in the same strange way! His heart beat excitedly, and for a few moments he was unable to move. At last he reached out his hand to touch the gold, but instead of hard, metal coins his fingers felt soft, warm curls.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="恢复知觉以后，他关上门回到炉火前，但当他的近视眼看到炉前的地板时，他好像发现了金子！金子——他的金子——奇怪地离他而去又以同样的方式奇怪地回到了他的身边！他的心剧烈地跳动起来，好一会儿他都不能移动。终于他伸手去摸那金子，可是没有摸到硬硬的金币，却摸到了软软的暖暖的鬈发。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">With great surprise Silas fell on his knees to look at this wonderful thing. It was a sleeping child. Was he dreaming? Could it be his little sister, who had died when he was a child himself? If it wasn't a dream, how had the child entered the cottage? But thinking of his sister made him remember the past, and his life at the Light Street chapel. He wondered if this child was some kind of message from his past, sent perhaps by the God he had once trusted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="西拉斯惊奇地跪到地上去看这神奇的东西。这是一个熟睡着的孩子。是不是在做梦？这是不是自己小时候死去的小妹妹？如果不是梦，这孩子怎么到屋里来的？想到妹妹使他想到了自己的过去，想到在日光街小教堂的事。他怀疑这孩子会不会是那他曾经信任过的上帝派来向他传递关于他过去生活的什么信息的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At the Red House, everybody was enjoying the party. Some people were still eating, while others were dancing or playing cards. Godfrey was looking forward to his next dance with Nancy. He was watching her dreamily across the room, when suddenly he saw something that made his lips go white and his whole body tremble. It was his own child, carried in Silas Marner's arms. The weaver had come straight into the hall, where the dancing was going on.</div>

<div class="line_en">When he and Dolly arrived at the quarry, the doctor had moved the woman into Silas's cottage, and Godfrey had to wait outside. He walked up and down in the snow, for what seemed like hours. He knew he should tell the truth about the woman and the child, but he could not make himself do what he knew was right. "Is she dead?" the voice inside his head asked. "If she is, I can marry Nancy. And then I'll be good, and have no more secrets. And I'll make sure the child is taken care of, of course.</div>

<div class="line_en">That week the dead woman was buried in Raveloe, and the child stayed at the weaver's cottage.

<div class="line_en">"I am," replied Silas firmly. "The mother's dead, and I suppose the child hasn't got a father. She's alone in the world, and so am I. My money's gone, I don't know where, and she's come, I don't know where from. I don't understand it at all, but I'm going to keep her."</div>

When he was working and living only for his gold, he had not been interested in the world outside his cottage, or the people he sometimes met. But now that he had another reason for living, he had to look outward. He spent hours in the fields with Eppie, happily rediscovering the plants he used to know so well. Together they visited his neighbours, who were always delighted to see him and his adopted child. His days and evenings were full, taking care of a trusting, loving child.</div>
