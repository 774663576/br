<div class="line_en">Ben just glanced at her, and Maisie -- Maisie was sitting on Richie's lap. Which would have made Eleanor throw right up if she hadn't just promised her mom that she'd be on her best behavior for the rest of her life.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Hey, Mouse," she said. They'd called him that since he was a baby, she couldn't remember why. He reminded her more of a big, sloppy puppy -- always excited, always trying to jump into your lap.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嗨，鼠鼠。”埃莉诺说。鼠鼠还是个小婴儿时他们这就么叫他，埃莉诺不记得为什么了。鼠鼠让她联想起胖胖的、懒散的小狗，永远那么兴奋，永远想跳到你的腿上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Richie pretended not to hear. Maisie watched and sucked her thumb. Eleanor hadn't seen her do that in years. She was eight now, but with her thumb in her mouth, she looked just like a baby.</div>

<div class="line_en">When she woke up in the middle of the night, all three of her brothers were asleep on the floor. There was no way to get up without stepping on one of them, and she didn't even know where the bathroom was…</div>

<div class="line_en">There wasn't room in this room to readjust. (Which Eleanor decided not to mention.) She went to bed as soon as she could, so she wouldn't have to go back out to the living room.</div>

<div class="line_en">Their mom carried the duffel bag with Eleanor's stuff into a bedroom off the living room, and Eleanor followed her. The room was tiny, just big enough for a dresser and some bunk beds. Mouse ran into the room after them. "You get the top bunk," he said, "and Ben has to sleep on the floor with me. Mom already told us, and Ben started to cry."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="妈妈提着装了埃莉诺物品的行李袋，走向客厅旁的卧室，埃莉诺跟在后面。那房间很小，只够放一个五斗柜和一张上下铺的床。鼠鼠跟着跑进来，说：“你睡上铺，班恩得跟我一起睡地板。妈咪已经说过了，班恩听了就哭了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When she got home from school, Eleanor let herself in with her new key. The house was possibly even more depressing in daylight -- dingy and bare -- but at least Eleanor had the place, and her mom, to herself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="放学后，埃莉诺用新钥匙打开家门。白天里，这屋子可能显得更压抑、寒碜、家徒四壁。但这个家和妈妈是专属于她的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She found it. There were only five rooms in the house, and the bathroom just barely counted. It was attached to the kitchen -- like literally attached, without a door. This house was designed by cave trolls, Eleanor thought. Somebody, probably her mom, had hung a flowered sheet between the refrigerator and the toilet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="找到了。这房子只有五间房，浴室勉强算一间，因为没有门，几乎跟厨房是相连的。这房子肯定是穴居的矮人设计的。不知道是谁（大概是她妈妈）用花床单当门帘，隔开了马桶与冰箱。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"How was school?" her mom asked.</div>

<div class="line_en">When Eleanor was a little girl, she'd thought her mom looked like a queen, like the star of some fairy tale.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃莉诺小时候觉得妈妈像皇后，像仙女故事里的闪亮明星。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Not a princess -- princesses are just pretty. Eleanor's mother was beautiful. She was tall and stately, with broad shoulders and an elegant waist. All of her bones seemed more purposeful than other people's. Like they weren't just there to hold her up, they were there to make a point.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不是公主——公主只是漂亮。而她妈妈是绝色！她高个子，宽肩膀，腰身优雅，气度高贵。身上的每根骨头都仿佛比别人的更具意义，不只是撑起身体，似乎还表达着某种态度。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She had a strong nose and a sharp chin, and her cheekbones were high and thick. You'd look at Eleanor's mom and think she must be carved into the prow of a Viking ship somewhere or maybe painted on the side of a plane…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她鼻子坚挺，下巴尖瘦，颧骨高而厚重。当你看着埃莉诺的妈妈，不禁会想到某艘维京海盗船的船头就刻着她的肖像，或者某架飞机的机身就画着她的面容…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Eleanor looked a lot like her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃莉诺跟她长得很像。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But not enough.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是不够像。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Eleanor looked like her mother through a fish tank. Rounder and softer. Slurred. Where her mother was statuesque, Eleanor was heavy. Where her mother was finely drawn, Eleanor was smudged.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果透过水族箱看她妈妈的脸，就是埃莉诺的模样。她整体要圆胖些，线条柔和些。简而言之，就是更模糊。她妈妈像雕像，而她是肥胖。她妈妈是妙笔偶成，她则是画笔脏了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After five kids, her mother had breasts and hips like a woman in a cigarette ad. At sixteen, Eleanor was already built like she ran a medieval pub.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她妈妈是在生了五个孩子后，才有了香烟广告里那种妇人的丰乳肥臀。埃莉诺才十六岁，看起来却已经像中世纪的酒馆老板娘。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She had too much of everything and too little height to hide it. Her breasts started just below her chin, her hips were… a parody. Even her mom's hair, long and wavy and auburn, was a more legitimate version of Eleanor's bright red curls.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她各个部位都很丰满，但又没有足够的身高来掩饰。她的胸部从下巴处就高耸而起，她的屁股则根本就是…胡闹。就连妈妈的红褐色波浪卷发都比她那一头鲜红色卷发显得更正统。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I couldn't bring all your things when we moved," she said. "Obviously we don't have as much room here as we had in the old house…" She reached into the closet and pulled out a black plastic garbage bag. "But I packed as much as I could."</div>

<div class="line_en">Her mom reached out and touched Eleanor's shoulder, just for a second. "The little kids will be home in twenty minutes or so," she said, "and we'll eat dinner around 4:30. I like to have everything settled before Richie comes home."</div>

<div class="line_en">The first thing she recognized were the paper dolls. They were loose in the bag and wrinkled; a few were marked with crayons. It had been years since Eleanor had played with them, but she was still happy to see them there. She pressed them flat and laid them in a pile.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第一个是纸娃娃，散放在垃圾袋里，有的还有蜡笔痕迹。埃莉诺已经好多年没玩这些娃娃了，但是能与它们重逢，还是很开心。她抚平这些娃娃，堆成一堆。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She wondered where the rest of the stuff from the old house had ended up. Not just her stuff, but everybody's. Like the furniture and the toys, and all of her mom's plants and paintings. Her grandma's Danish wedding plates… The little red "Uff da!" horse that always used to hang above the sink.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不知道老房子的其他东西去哪了。不光是她的私人物品，还有大家共有的，比如家具、玩具、妈妈的植物，还有画、外婆那套丹麦瓷盘嫁妆，以及一直挂在水槽上的那只红色瑞典达拉木马。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Under the dolls were books, a dozen or so that her mother must have grabbed at random; she wouldn't have known which were Eleanor's favorites. Eleanor was glad to see Garp and Watership Down. It sucked that Oliver's Story had made the cut, but Love Story hadn't. And Little Men was there, but not Little Women or Jo's Boys.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="娃娃下面放着十几本书，显然是她妈妈随手拿的，她绝对不知道哪些是埃莉诺最爱的书。埃莉诺很高兴里面有《盖普眼中的世界》《瓦特希普高原》、可是有《爱的故事续集》却没有《爱的故事》，糟透了。还有啊，有《小绅士》却居然没有《小妇人》与《乔的男孩们》。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a bunch more papers in the bag. She'd had a file cabinet in her old room, and it looked like her mom had grabbed most of the folders. Eleanor tried to get everything into a neat stack, all the report cards and school pictures and letters from pen pals.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="垃圾袋里还有更多的纸。埃莉诺以前的房间有个文件柜，看来妈妈抓来了大部分的文件夹，成绩单啦，毕业照啦，笔友的信啦，埃莉诺把它们堆成一堆。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Eleanor opened it carefully. Nothing inside had been touched. There was her stationery, her colored pencils and her Prismacolor markers (another Christmas present from her uncle). There was a stack of promotional cards from the mall that still smelled like expensive perfumes. And there was her Walkman. Untouched. Un-batteried, too, but nevertheless, there. And where there was a Walkman, there was the possibility of music.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃莉诺小心地打开盒子，里面的东西完好如初。她的文具盒、彩色笔和油性彩色马克笔（也是舅舅送的圣诞礼物）。还有一叠购物中心的促销卡片，闻起来仍有昂贵香水的味道。以及她的随身听，没坏，但是也没电池，不过有总比没有好。只要有随身听，就代表有机会听音乐。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Maybe it was packed away somewhere. Maybe her mom was hoping the cave-troll house was just temporary.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可能都塞在某个地方吧。或许她妈妈也希望这个矮人洞穴般的房子只是暂时的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At the bottom of the black trash bag was a box. Her heart jumped a little when she saw it. Her uncle in Minnesota used to send her family a Fruit of the Month Club membership every Christmas, and Eleanor and her brothers and sister would always fight over the boxes that the fruit came in. It was stupid, but they were good boxes -- solid, with nice lids. This one was a grapefruit box, soft from wear at the edges.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黑色垃圾袋的底部有个盒子。看见时，她的心怦地一跳。每年圣诞节，明尼苏达州的舅舅都会寄来一盒“本月水果俱乐部”的会员水果，埃莉诺和弟弟妹妹们总是抢着要装水果的盒子。想想就好笑，不过那盒子很好，很坚固，又有盖子。这个是装葡萄柚的，年代久远，盒子边缘有点软了。">查看中文翻译</div>

Then she pushed the bag back as far as she could on the highest shelf in the closet, behind the towels and a humidifier.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就算她把东西都分类整理好了又能怎么样呢？五斗柜连放她衣服的地方都没有。她把盒子和书本挑出来放在一边，小心翼翼地把其他东西一一放回垃圾袋，塞到衣柜最高层的角落，放在毛巾和加湿器的后面。">查看中文翻译</div>
