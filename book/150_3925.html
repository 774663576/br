<div class="line_en">But after all it was the nuns that had most deeply touched her. Sister St Joseph, with her merry face and apple-red cheeks; she had been one of the little band that came out to China with the Mother Superior ten years before and she had seen one after another of her companions die of disease, privations, and homesickness; and yet she remained cheerful and happy. What was it that gave her that naive and charming humour? And the Mother Superior. Kitty in fancy stood again in her presence and once more she felt humble and ashamed. Though she was so simple and unaffected she had a native dignity which inspired awe, and you could not imagine that any one could treat her without respect. Sister St Joseph by the way she stood, by every small gesture and the intonation of her answers, had shown the deep submission in which she held herself; and Waddington, frivolous and impertinent, had shown by his tone that he was not quite at his ease. Kitty thought it unnecessary to have told her that the Mother Superior belonged to one of the great families of France; there was that in her bearing which suggested ancient race, and she had the authority of one who has never known that it is possible to be disobeyed. She had the condescension of a great lady and the humility of a saint. There was in her strong, handsome, and ravaged face an austerity that was passionate; and at the same time she had a solicitude and a gentleness which permitted those little children to cluster, noisy and unafraid, in the assurance of her deep affection. When she had looked at the four new-born babies she had worn a smile that was sweet and yet profound: it was like a ray of sunshine on a wild and desolate heath. What Sister St Joseph had said so carelessly of Walter moved Kitty strangely; she knew that he had desperately wanted her to bear a child, but she had never suspected from his reticence that he was capable with a baby of showing without embarrassment a charming and playful tenderness. Most men were silly and awkward with babies. How strange he was!</div>

<div class="line_en">But to all that moving experience there had been a shadow (a dark lining to the silver cloud), insistent and plain, which disconcerted her. In the sober gaiety of Sister St Joseph, and much more in the beautiful courtesy of the Mother Superior, she had felt an aloofness which oppressed her. They were friendly and even cordial, but at the same time they held something back, she knew not what, so that she was conscious that she was nothing but a casual stranger. There was a barrier between her and them. They spoke a different language not only of the tongue but of the heart. And when the door was closed upon her she felt that they had put her out of their minds so completely, going about their neglected work again without delay, that for them she might never have existed. She felt shut out not only from that poor little convent, but from some mysterious garden of the spirit after which with all her soul she hankered. She felt on a sudden alone as she had never felt alone before. That was why she had wept.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而除了这一幕幕感人的回忆外，在她心头似乎还潜藏着一层阴影（如同银色的云彩边缘镶了一圈儿黑色的乌云），怎么也挥之不去。在圣约瑟姐妹的欢声笑语中，更多的是在修道院长优雅的待客之道上，凯蒂始终感受到了一种漠然。不消说，她们今天对她是友善乃至热情的，但同时她们还另有所保留，具体是什么凯蒂也说不上来。她觉得对她们来说，她只不过是随便哪一位初来乍到的客人。她们不仅说了一种和凯蒂完全不同的语言，其心思也是和凯蒂相隔万里。修道院的门关上的一刹那，她们会把她忘得一干二净，然后一刻也不耽搁地去忙刚刚落下的活计，就跟她这个人根本没有来过一样。她觉得她不仅是被关在那所小修道院的门外，而且被关在了她一直孜孜追求的神秘精神花园的大门外。她忽然感到前所未有的孤独。那就是她哭泣的原因。">查看中文翻译</div>
