<div class="line_en">Our city, tho' laid out with a beautiful regularity, the streets large, strait, and crossing each other at right angles, had the disgrace of suffering those streets to remain long unpav'd, and in wet weather the wheels of heavy carriages plough'd them into a quagmire, so that it was difficult to cross them; and in dry weather the dust was offensive. I had liv'd near what was call'd the Jersey Market, and saw with pain the inhabitants wading in mud while purchasing their provisions. A strip of ground down the middle of that market was at length pav'd with brick, so that, being once in the market, they had firm footing, but were often over shoes in dirt to get there.</div>

This, for some time, gave an easy access to the market dry-shod; but, the rest of the street not being pav'd, whenever a carriage came out of the mud upon this pavement, it shook off and left its dirt upon it, and it was soon cover'd with mire, which was not remov'd, the city as yet having no scavengers.</div>

<div class="line_en">After some inquiry I found a poor industrious man, who was willing to undertake keeping the pavement clean, by sweeping it twice a week, carrying off the dirt from before all the neighbours' doors, for the sum of sixpence per month, to be paid by each house. I then wrote and printed a paper setting forth the advantages to the neighbourhood that might be obtain'd by this small expense; the greater ease in keeping our houses clean, so much dirt not being brought in by people's feet; the benefit to the shops by more custom, etc., etc., as buyers could more easily get at them; and by not having, in windy weather, the dust blown in upon their goods, etc., etc. I sent one of these papers to each house, and in a day or two went round to see who would subscribe an agreement to pay these sixpences; it was unanimously sign'd, and for a time well executed. All the inhabitants of the city were delighted with the cleanliness of the pavement that surrounded the market, it being a convenience to all, and this rais'd a general desire to have all the streets paved, and made the people more willing to submit to a tax for that purpose.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="经过了一番调查以后，我找到一个贫穷勤劳的人，他愿意做清道工作，每周扫街两次并把每家门前的垃圾搬走，每家每月出资六便士。接着我就写了一张传单，把它印了出来，指出这一笔小小的费用可能替邻近的人们带来的好处。例如，由人们脚上带进来的泥泞减少了，我们家里就可以比较容易弄干净了；街道清洁后，顾客更容易到店铺来，顾客增多可以增加商店的营业等；在刮风的时候，灰沙不致吹到他们的货物上去等等。我每家分发一张传单，一两天后我跑到各家去访问，看究竟有多少人愿意签订合同支付这六便士。各家毫无例外地都签了合同，在一个时期内这个计划进行得顺利。全市居民对于市场附近街道的清洁，因为它便利了大家，都感到很高兴。这就使得人们普遍地要求把所有街道都修铺起来，同时也使得他们更愿意为铺路而纳税。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After some time I drew a bill for paving the city, and brought it into the Assembly. It was just before I went to England, in 1757, and did not pass till I was gone. and then with an alteration in the mode of assessment, which I thought not for the better, but with an additional provision for lighting as well as paving the streets, which was a great improvement. It was by a private person, the late Mr. John Clifton, his giving a sample of the utility of lamps, by placing one at his door, that the people were first impress'd with the idea of enlighting all the city. The honour of this public benefit has also been ascrib'd to me but it belongs truly to that gentleman. I did but follow his example, and have only some merit to claim respecting the form of our lamps, as differing from the globe lamps we were at first supply'd with from London. Those we found inconvenient in these respects: they admitted no air below; the smoke, therefore, did not readily go out above, but circulated in the globe, lodg'd on its inside, and soon obstructed the light they were intended to afford; giving, besides, the daily trouble of wiping them clean; and an accidental stroke on one of them would demolish it, and render it totally useless. I therefore suggested the composing them of four flat panes, with a long funnel above to draw up the smoke, and crevices admitting air below, to facilitate the ascent of the smoke; by this means they were kept clean, and did not grow dark in a few hours, as the London lamps do, but continu'd bright till morning, and an accidental stroke would generally break but a single pane, easily repair'd.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过了一些时候，我起草了一个替费城铺路的议案，并在州议会中提了出来。这件事发生在一七五七年，刚在我去英国之前，等我离开美洲后，这议案才获得通过，当时在估定税额的方式方面做了某些变更，这些变动我认为是不好的，但通过的议案还附有关于路灯的条款，这倒是一个很大的改进。一个普通老百姓，已故的约翰·克利夫敦先生，曾经把一盏灯装在他门口，这样他就用实际的榜样说明了路灯的效用，人们是从他的实例中首先想到在全城各处点灯的念头的。有人把首创这一件公益事业的光荣归于我，但实在是属于那位先生的。我只是模仿了他的榜样，我只是在改进路灯的形状方面略有微功。我们的路灯跟起初我们从伦敦买来的球状路灯是不同的。这些圆形的路灯有下列缺点：空气不能从下面进去，因此烟煤不能迅速地从上面出去，烟煤只在圆球内打转，黏附在球壁上，不久就阻塞了路灯应发的光线，而且每天需要去擦拭灯罩，如果一不小心碰一下就破了，整个灯罩就变成无用了。因此我建议用四块平玻璃拼凑起来，上面装一长烟囱以便烟煤上升，灯下开裂缝以便空气进去，促进烟煤的上升。这样，灯罩就可保持干净，不至于像伦敦的路灯那样，在几小时内就变成昏暗无光了，路灯就可以不断地光明灿烂直到天明。即使偶然碰一下，一般也只敲破一块玻璃，重配也很方便。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The mention of these improvements puts me in mind of one I propos'd, when in London, to Dr. Fothergill, who was among the best men I have known, and a great promoter of useful projects. I had observ'd that the streets, when dry, were never swept, and the light dust carried away; but it was suffer'd to accumulate till wet weather reduc'd it to mud, and then, after lying some days so deep on the pavement that there was no crossing but in paths kept clean by poor people with brooms, it was with great labour rak'd together and thrown up into carts open above, the sides of which suffer'd some of the slush at every jolt on the pavement to shake out and fall, sometimes to the annoyance of foot-passengers. The reason given for not sweeping the dusty streets was, that the dust would fly into the windows of shops and houses.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="提起这些改进，使我想起我在伦敦时曾向方寿节博士建议的一件事。方寿节博士是我认识的人中间最优秀的人之一，是公益事业的一个伟大首创者。我看到在天晴的时候，伦敦的街道是从来没有人去扫的，尘土随风飘扬，听其自然积储起来，一下雨尘土就变成了泥浆，满街泥泞，不堪涉足，除了由穷人拿着扫帚开辟出来的一条小道外，连穿越街道都不可能。这样过了几天后，人们花了很艰巨的劳动把泥浆耙起来，倒进上端敞开的马车中。但是当马车在马路上颠簸时，车身两侧会震出烂泥来，掉在路上，有时使路人感到烦恼。伦敦市民之所以不扫除街上尘土的理由据说是因为怕尘土会飞进商店和住宅的窗户。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I have sometimes wonder'd that the Londoners did not, from the effect holes in the bottom of the globe lamps us'd at Vauxhall have in keeping them clean, learn to have such holes in their street lamps. But, these holes being made for another purpose, viz., to communicate flame more suddenly to the wick by a little flax hanging down thro' them, the other use, of letting in air, seems not to have been thought of; and therefore, after the lamps have been lit a few hours, the streets of London are very poorly illuminated.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伦敦伏克斯可花园的球状灯底下的孔洞使得灯罩干净，我有时候觉得很奇怪为什么伦敦市民没有想到在他们的路灯底下同样地也开几个孔。果然他们的路灯底下也有孔，但是这些孔洞是别有用途的，那就是，用麻线穿过这些孔洞悬挂下来，使得火焰能够迅速地传递到灯心。至于放入空气的用途，他们好像并没有想到，因此，路灯点了几小时以后，伦敦街上已经暗淡无光了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I then judg'd that, if that feeble woman could sweep such a street in three hours, a strong, active man might have done it in half the time. And here let me remark the convenience of having but one gutter in such a narrow street, running down its middle, instead of two, one on each side, near the footway; for where all the rain that falls on a street runs from the sides and meets in the middle, it forms there a current strong enough to wash away all the mud it meets with; but when divided into two channels, it is often too weak to cleanse either, and only makes the mud it finds more fluid, so that the wheels of carriages and feet of horses throw and dash it upon the foot-pavement, which is thereby rendered foul and slippery, and sometimes splash it upon those who are walking. My proposal, communicated to the good doctor, was as follows:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当时我认为假如一个虚弱的妇人可以在三小时内扫这样一条街，一个强壮敏捷的男子或许只要一半的时间就可以办到。在这里让我说明，在这样狭窄的街道中，与其两边靠近人行道处各有明沟一条，不如在街道中央开一条沟较为便利，因为当一条街上的全部雨水从两边集中在中央时，它在中央形成一股急流，有足够的力量可以冲洗掉它所接触到的全部泥土。但是如果把它分成两路，水流就常常太弱，不能冲洗掉两边的泥土，只不过使它所接触到的泥土更加稀烂，所以车轮和马脚就把它泼溅在人行道上，因此使得人行道肮脏泞滑，有时也会把泥浆溅在路人身上。我曾向这位善良的博士提出了如下的建议：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">An accidental occurrence had instructed me how much sweeping might be done in a little time. I found at my door in Craven-street, one morning, a poor woman sweeping my pavement with a birch broom; she appeared very pale and feeble, as just come out of a fit of sickness. I ask'd who employ'd her to sweep there; she said, "Nobody, but I am very poor and in distress, and I sweeps before gentlefolkses doors, and hopes they will give me something." I bid her sweep the whole street clean, and I would give her a shilling; this was at nine o'clock; at 12 she came for the shilling. From the slowness I saw at first in her working, I could scarce believe that the work was done so soon, and sent my servant to examine it, who reported that the whole street was swept perfectly clean, and all the dust plac'd in the gutter, which was in the middle; and the next rain wash'd it quite away, so that the pavement and even the kennel were perfectly clean.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一件偶然发生的事情使我知道扫街原花不了多少时间。一天早晨，在我克雷文街寓所的门口，我看见一个穷苦的妇人拿着一把桦树枝扫帚在扫我门前的人行道，她看上去很苍白很软弱，好像大病初愈的样子。我问她谁雇用她来扫街，她说：“谁也没有雇用我，但是我穷苦不堪，我在富贵人家门前扫地，我希望他们会给我一点钱。”我要她把整条街扫干净，我愿意给她一先令。当时是九时整，在十二点钟时她来要钱了。我起初看她动作很迟缓，我简直不能相信这件事那么快就做完了。我派我的仆人去看个究竟，他回来报告说整条街扫得一干二净，所有尘土都放在路中央的明沟中了。下一次下雨的时候，就把尘土冲走，所以人行道，甚至陰沟，都十分干净了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I have since had doubts of the practicability of the latter part of this proposal, on account of the narrowness of some streets, and the difficulty of placing the draining-sleds so as not to encumber too much the passage; but I am still of opinion that the former, requiring the dust to be swept up and carry'd away before the shops are open, is very practicable in the summer, when the days are long; for, in walking thro' the Strand and Fleet-street one morning at seven o'clock, I observ'd there was not one shop open, tho' it had been daylight and the sun up above three hours; the inhabitants of London chusing voluntarily to live much by candle-light, and sleep by sunshine, and yet often complain, a little absurdly, of the duty on candles and the high price of tallow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从那时以后我对这个建议的后半部是否切实可行，有点怀疑了，因为有些街道很狭窄，泥车放在那里就不能不占去太多的地位，以致阻塞交通，但是我还以为那前半部（主张在商店营业前扫清街道运走垃圾），在夏天是切实可行的，因为夏天日子长。有一天早晨七点钟，我走过伦敦河滨街和佛里特街，看见虽然天已经亮了，太陽已经出来三小时多了，可是还没有一家店铺开门。伦敦的市民宁愿在烛光下生活，在白天睡觉，但是在另一方面，他们常常抱怨烛税太高，烛价过昂，真有点荒唐哩。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Some may think these trifling matters not worth minding or relating; but when they consider that tho' dust blown into the eyes of a single person, or into a single shop on a windy day, is but of small importance, yet the great number of the instances in a populous city, and its frequent repetitions give it weight and consequence, perhaps they will not censure very severely those who bestow some attention to affairs of this seemingly low nature. Human felicity is produc'd not so much by great pieces of good fortune that seldom happen, as by little advantages that occur every day. Thus, if you teach a poor young man to shave himself, and keep his razor in order, you may contribute more to the happiness of his life than in giving him a thousand guineas. The money may be soon spent, the regret only remaining of having foolishly consumed it; but in the other case, he escapes the frequent vexation of waiting for barbers, and of their sometimes dirty fingers, offensive breaths, and dull razors; he shaves when most convenient to him, and enjoys daily the pleasure of its being done with a good instrument. With these sentiments I have hazarded the few preceding pages, hoping they may afford hints which some time or other may be useful to a city I love, having lived many years in it very happily, and perhaps to some of our towns in America.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="也许有人以为这些小事不值得留心或加以叙述。虽然在刮风的时候，灰沙吹进一个人的眼睛或是一家店铺，那是小事，但是假如他们考虑到在人口众多的城市里有千千万万的人或店铺受到灰沙的袭击以及这些袭击的经常反复，他们就会觉得这是一件重要的大事，可能他们就不会过分地非难那些留意这些似乎微不足道的事项的人了。造成人类幸福的与其说是千载难逢的巨大的幸运，倒不如说是每日发生的细小的方便。所以如果你教会一个贫穷的年轻人自己修面，保养他的剃刀，你对他一生幸福所做的贡献可能比给他一千金币还大。钱可能很快地花光，只留下了用钱不当的懊恨。但是假如教会他自己修面，他就可以避免经常等待理发师修面的麻烦，避免理发师有时候肮脏的手指，令人不快的呼吸和迟钝的剃刀。他可以在最方便的时候修面，每天享受用锋利剃刀修面的快乐。在这种思想的支配之下，我冒昧地写下了前面这几页，希望它们包含了一些启发性的东西。这些东西可能有时对我亲爱的城市（我在这城里快乐地住了许多年了），或许对我们美洲的其他城市不无参考的价值。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Having been for some time employed by the postmaster-general of America as his comptroller in regulating several offices, and bringing the officers to account, I was, upon his death in 1753, appointed, jointly with Mr. William Hunter, to succeed him, by a commission from the postmaster-general in England. The American office never had hitherto paid any thing to that of Britain. We were to have six hundred pounds a year between us, if we could make that sum out of the profits of the office. To do this, a variety of improvements were necessary; some of these were inevitably at first expensive, so that in the first four years the office became above nine hundred pounds in debt to us. But it soon after began to repay us; and before I was displac'd by a freak of the ministers, of which I shall speak hereafter, we had brought it to yield three times as much clear revenue to the crown as the postoffice of Ireland.

The debates upon it in Congress went on daily, hand in hand with the Indian business. Many objections and difficulties were started, but at length they were all overcome, and the plan was unanimously agreed to, and copies ordered to be transmitted to the Board of Trade and to the assemblies of the several provinces. Its fate was singular: the assemblies did not adopt it, as they all thought there was too much prerogative in it, and in England it was judg'd to have too much of the democratic.</div>

<div class="line_en">Being the winter following in Boston, I had much conversation with Governor Shirley upon both the plans. Part of what passed between us on the occasion may also be seen among those papers. The different and contrary reasons of dislike to my plan makes me suspect that it was really the true medium; and I am still of opinion it would have been happy for both sides the water if it had been adopted. The colonies, so united, would have been sufficiently strong to have defended themselves; there would then have been no need of troops from England; of course, the subsequent pretence for taxing America, and the bloody contest it occasioned, would have been avoided.

He brought a commission to supersede Mr. Hamilton, who, tir'd with the disputes his proprietary instructions subjected him to, had resign'd. Mr. Morris ask'd me if I thought he must expect as uncomfortable an administration. I said, "No; you may, on the contrary, have a very comfortable one, if you will only take care not to enter into any dispute with the Assembly." "My dear friend," says he, pleasantly, "how can you advise my avoiding disputes? You know I love disputing; it is one of my greatest pleasures; however, to show the regard I have for your counsel, I promise you I will, if possible, avoid them." He had some reason for loving to dispute, being eloquent, an acute sophister, and, therefore, generally successful in argumentative conversation. He had been brought up to it from a boy, his father, as I have heard, accustoming his children to dispute with one another for his diversion, while sitting at table after dinner; but I think the practice was not wise; for, in the course of my observation, these disputing, contradicting, and confuting people are generally unfortunate in their affairs. They get victory sometimes, but they never get good will, which would be of more use to them. We parted, he going to Philadelphia, and I to Boston.</div>

<div class="line_en">One afternoon, in the height of this public quarrel, we met in the street. "Franklin," says he, "you must go home with me and spend the evening; I am to have some company that you will like;" and, taking me by the arm, he led me to his house. In gay conversation over our wine, after supper, he told us, jokingly, that he much admir'd the idea of Sancho Panza, who, when it was proposed to give him a government, requested it might be a government of blacks, as then, if he could not agree with his people, he might sell them. One of his friends, who sat next to me, says, "Franklin, why do you continue to side with these damn'd Quakers? Had not you better sell them? The proprietor would give you a good price." "The governor," says I, "has not yet blacked them enough." He, indeed, had labored hard to blacken the Assembly in all his messages, but they wip'd off his coloring as fast as he laid it on, and plac'd it, in return, thick upon his own face; so that, finding he was likely to be negrofied himself, he, as well as Mr. Hamilton, grew tir'd of the contest, and quitted the government.</div>

I had my share of it; for, as soon as I got back to my seat in the Assembly, I was put on every committee for answering his speeches and messages, and by the committees always desired to make the drafts. Our answers, as well as his messages, were often tart, and sometimes indecently abusive; and, as he knew I wrote for the Assembly, one might have imagined that, when we met, we could hardly avoid cutting throats; but he was so good-natur'd a man that no personal difference between him and me was occasion'd by the contest, and we often din'd together.</div>

<div class="line_en">These public quarrels were all at bottom owing to the proprietaries, our hereditary governors, who, when any expense was to be incurred for the defense of their province, with incredible meanness instructed their deputies to pass no act for levying the necessary taxes, unless their vast estates were in the same act expressly excused; and they had even taken bonds of these deputies to observe such instructions. The Assemblies for three years held out against this injustice, tho' constrained to bend at last.

There was, indeed, little or no money at that time in the office, and therefore I propos'd that the orders should be payable in a year, and to bear an interest of five per cent. With these orders I suppos'd the provisions might easily be purchas'd. The Assembly, with very little hesitation, adopted the proposal. The orders were immediately printed, and I was one of the committee directed to sign and dispose of them. The fund for paying them was the interest of all the paper currency then extant in the province upon loan, together with the revenue arising from the excise, which being known to be more than sufficient, they obtain'd instant credit, and were not only receiv'd in payment for the provisions, but many money'd people, who had cash lying by them, vested it in those orders, which they found advantageous, as they bore interest while upon hand, and might on any occasion be used as money; so that they were eagerly all bought up, and in a few weeks none of them were to be seen.
