<div class="line_en">"Carl" Mikael Blomkvist saw them through the doorway and slowed his step. He had no wish to discuss the verdict, but questions were unavoidable, and he -- of all people -- knew that they had to be asked and answered. This is how it is to be a criminal, he thought. On the other side of the microphone. He straightened up and tried to smile. The reporters gave him friendly, almost embarrassed greetings.</div>

<div class="line_en">Blomkvist, hearing the nickname, forced himself as always not to roll his eyes. Once, when he was twenty-three and had just started his first summer job as a journalist, Blomkvist had chanced upon a gang which had pulled off five bank robberies over the past two years. There was no doubt that it was the same gang in every instance. Their trademark was to hold up two banks at a time with military precision. They wore masks from Disney World, so inevitably police logic dubbed them the Donald Duck Gang. The newspapers renamed them the Bear Gang, which sounded more sinister, more appropriate to the fact that on two occasions they had recklessly fired warning shots and threatened curious passersby.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布隆维斯特听到这个绰号，一如往常地按捺住不翻白眼。当他二十三岁，刚开始记者工作的第一个夏天，碰巧撞上一帮在过去两年内成功抢劫了五家银行的劫匪。毫无疑问，每宗案子都是同一伙人干的，他们的特点就是以军事化的精准行动一次同时抢两家银行。劫匪戴着迪斯尼卡通人物的面具，依警方的逻辑难免会给他们冠上“唐老鸭党”的称号。报章则为他们另起封号为“熊党”，听起来较邪恶也较贴近事实，因为其中两次作案时，他们都不顾一切地开枪警告并威胁好奇的路人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Blomkvist was spending several days with a girlfriend at her parents' summer cabin near Katrineholm. Exactly why he made the connection he could not explain, even to the police, but as he was listening to the news report he remembered a group of four men in a summer cabin a few hundred feet down the road. He had seen them playing badminton out in the yard: four blond, athletic types in shorts with their shirts off. They were obviously bodybuilders, and there had been something about them that had made him look twice -- maybe it was because the game was being played in blazing sunshine with what he recognised as intensely focused energy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那时布隆维斯特正与女友在她父母位于卡特琳娜霍尔姆的避暑小屋度假。他究竟如何产生联想，就连对警方他也无从解释，只不过当他听到新闻报道，便想起在同一条路上几百米外的避暑小屋里那四名男子。他看过他们在院子里打羽毛球：四名健壮灵活的金发男子穿着短裤、光着上身。他们显然都锻炼过肌肉，而且散发出某种特质让他多看了一眼——也许是因为他们在炽热的阳光下，以一种他认为火力十足的劲道打球吧！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Their sixth outing was at a bank in Östergötland at the height of the holiday season. A reporter from the local radio station happened to be in the bank at the time. As soon as the robbers were gone he went to a public telephone and dictated his story for live broadcast.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们第六次出动是在假期旺季，目标是东约特兰的一家银行，当时刚好有个当地广播电台的记者在现场。劫匪一离开，他立刻找公共电话以直播方式口述事发经过。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There had been no good reason to suspect them of being the bank robbers, but nevertheless he had gone to a hill overlooking their cabin. It seemed empty. It was about forty minutes before a Volvo drove up and parked in the yard. The young men got out, in a hurry, and were each carrying a sports bag, so they might have been doing nothing more than coming back from a swim. But one of them returned to the car and took out from the boot something which he hurriedly covered with his jacket. Even from Blomkvist's relatively distant observation post he could tell that it was a good old AK4, the rifle that had been his constant companion for the year of his military service.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其实没有合理的原因怀疑他们是银行劫匪，但他还是爬到小丘上观察他们的小屋。屋里似乎没人。约莫四十分钟后，一辆沃尔沃开进院子停下，那些年轻人匆匆下车，每个人各拿着一个运动提袋，很可能只是刚游泳回来。但其中一人又回到车旁，从后备箱拿出一样东西并很快用夹克遮住。尽管布隆维斯特距离颇远，仍看得出那是一把旧式AK4步枪——他当兵那年这曾是他寸步不离的伙伴。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He called the police and that was the start of a three-day siege of the cabin, blanket coverage by the media, with Blomkvist in a front-row seat and collecting a gratifyingly large fee from an evening paper. The police set up their headquarters in a caravan in the garden of the cabin where Blomkvist was staying.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他打电话报警，随即对小屋展开为期三天的包围，一面有媒体作地毯式的报道，而布隆维斯特就坐在第一排，还从一家晚报拿到令人满意的丰厚报酬。警方则将一截活动房屋拖进布隆维斯特住的小屋院子里，当作总部。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The fall of the Bear Gang gave him the star billing that launched him as a young journalist. The downside of his celebrity was that the other evening newspaper could not resist using the headline "Kalle Blomkvist solves the case." The tongue-in-cheek story was written by an older female columnist and contained references to the young detective in Astrid Lindgren's books for children. To make matters worse, the paper had run the story with a grainy photograph of Blomkvist with his mouth half open even as he raised an index finger to point.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“熊党”的落网使他一炮而红，也开启了他的记者生涯。但成名的负面效应是，另一家晚报忍不住下了这样的标题：“小侦探卡莱·布隆维斯特破案记”。写这篇讽刺报道的是一个年纪较长的专栏女作家，文中提到阿斯特丽德·林格伦书中那个小侦探①更糟的是，报上还刊登了他嘴巴微张、伸出食指指着方向的模糊照片。【注：①阿斯特丽德·林格伦（Astrid Lindgren，1907—2002），是瑞典著名的儿童文学作家，曾写过《大侦探小卡莱》一书，书中主角是一名少年侦探，名叫卡莱·布隆维斯特，与本书主角姓名卡尔·布隆维斯特极为相似。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It made no difference that Blomkvist had never in life used the name Carl. From that moment on, to his dismay, he was nicknamed Kalle Blomkvist by his peers -- an epithet employed with taunting provocation, not unfriendly but not really friendly either. In spite of his respect for Astrid Lindgren -- whose books he loved -- he detested the nickname. It took him several years and far weightier journalistic successes before the nickname began to fade, but he still cringed if ever the name was used in his hearing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管布隆维斯特一辈子没用过卡莱这个名字，却惊愕地发现从那时起，同僚们都昵称他为“小侦探”——一个带着嘲弄与挑衅的绰号，虽无恶意却也不全然友善。尽管他很敬重林格伦，也爱看她的书，却很讨厌这个外号。他花了几年时间，在新闻界有了许多更重要的成就后，这个绰号才逐渐被人淡忘，但每当再次听见仍不免生厌。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Blomkvist said nothing. Borg and Blomkvist had known each other for fifteen years. They had worked together as cub reporters for the financial section of a morning paper. Maybe it was a question of chemistry, but the foundation had been laid there for a lifelong enmity. In Blomkvist's eyes, Borg had been a third-rate reporter and a troublesome person who annoyed everyone around him with crass jokes and made disparaging remarks about the more experienced, older reporters. He seemed to dislike the older female reporters in particular. They had their first quarrel, then others, and anon the antagonism turned personal.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布隆维斯特一语不发。他和博格已经相识十五年，曾一起在某日报担任财经版的菜鸟记者。也许是磁场不合，从那时起便已奠定一辈子的敌意。在布隆维斯特看来，博格是个三流记者，也是个喜欢说无聊笑话并狂妄地批评资深前辈而惹人厌的家伙，而且他似乎特别不喜欢较年长的女记者。他们吵过一次架，后来又吵了几次，不久对彼此的敌视便转变成个人因素。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Over the years, they had run into each other regularly, but it was not until the late nineties that they became serious enemies. Blomkvist had published a book about financial journalism and quoted extensively a number of idiotic articles written by Borg. Borg came across as a pompous ass who got many of his facts upside down and wrote homages to dot-com companies that were on the brink of going under. When thereafter they met by chance in a bar in Söder they had all but come to blows. Borg left journalism, and now he worked in PR -- for a considerably higher salary -- at a firm that, to make things worse, was part of industrialist Hans-Erik Wennerström's sphere of influence.</div>

At the end of the go-go eighties, during a period when he had a steady job and a pretty good salary, he had looked around for a permanent place to live. He ran from one apartment showing to another before he stumbled on an attic flat of 700 square feet right at the end of Bellmansgatan.

<div class="line_en">This was the first time that Blomkvist had faced any charge. The judgement was a trifle, relatively speaking. A lightweight crime. Not armed robbery, murder, or rape after all. From a financial point of view, however, it was serious -- Millennium was not a flagship of the media world with unlimited resources, the magazine barely broke even -- but the judgement did not spell catastrophe. The problem was that Blomkvist was one of Millennium's part owners, and at the same time, idiotically enough, he was both a writer and the magazine's publisher.

He put money into fixing up the bathroom and the kitchen area, but instead of putting in a parquet floor and interior walls to make it into the planned two-room apartment, he sanded the floor-boards, whitewashed the rough walls, and hid the worst patches behind two watercolours by Emanuel Bernstone. The result was an open living space, with the bedroom area behind a bookshelf, and the dining area and the living room next to the small kitchen behind a counter. The apartment had two dormer windows and a gable window with a view of the rooftops towards Gamla Stan, Stockholm's oldest section, and the water of Riddarfjärden.

<div class="line_en">The Wennerström affair had started out with such promise in the cockpit of a thirty-seven-foot Mälar-30 on Midsummer Eve a year and a half earlier. It began by chance, all because a former journalist colleague, now a PR flunky at the county council, wanted to impress his new girlfriend. He had rashly hired a Scampi for a few days of romantic sailing in the Stockholm archipelago. The girlfriend, just arrived from Hallstahammar to study in Stockholm, had agreed to the outing after putting up token resistance, but only if her sister and her sister's boyfriend could come too. None of the trio from Hallstahammar had any sailing experience, and unfortunately Blomkvist's old colleague had more enthusiasm than experience.

<div class="line_en">Blomkvist had not thought much of the proposal, but he came around when promised a few days of relaxation in the archipelago with good food and pleasant company. These promises came to naught, and the expedition turned into more of a disaster than he could have imagined. They had sailed the beautiful but not very dramatic route from Bullandö up through Furusund Strait at barely 9 knots, but the new girlfriend was instantly seasick. Her sister started arguing with her boyfriend, and none of them showed the slightest interest in learning the least little thing about sailing. It quickly became clear that Blomkvist was expected to take charge of the boat while the others gave him well-intentioned but basically meaningless advice. After the first night in a bay on Ängsö he was ready to dock the boat at Furusund and take the bus home. Only their desperate appeals persuaded him to stay.</div>

<div class="line_en">At noon the next day, early enough that there were still a few spaces available, they tied up at the visitors' wharf on the picturesque island of Arholma. They had thrown some lunch together and had just finished when Blomkvist noticed a yellow fibreglass M-30 gliding into the bay using only its mainsail. The boat made a graceful tack while the helmsman looked for a spot at the wharf. Blomkvist too scanned the space around and saw that the gap between their Scampi and an H-boat on the starboard side was the only slot left. The narrow M-30 would just fit. He stood up in the stern and pointed; the man in the M-30 raised a hand in thanks and steered towards the wharf. A lone sailor who was not going to bother starting up the engine, Blomkvist noticed. He heard the rattle of the anchor chain and seconds later the main came down, while the skipper moved like a scalded cat to guide the rudder straight for the slot and at the same time ready the line from the bow.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sometime that evening, after they had given up the battle with Arholma's notorious mosquitoes and moved down to the cabin, and after quite a few shots of aquavit, the conversation turned to friendly banter about ethics in the corporate world. Lindberg had gone from school to the Stockholm School of Economics and into the banking business. Blomkvist had graduated from the Stockholm School of Journalism and devoted much of his professional life to exposing corruption in the banking and business world.

In theory, it was an assistance project that built on the principle of offering help for self-help, and it was supposed to give the regimes in the East the opportunity to restructure their economies. In practice, however, it meant that Swedish companies would get state subventions for going in and establishing themselves as part owners in companies in Eastern European countries. That goddammed minister in the Christian party was an ardent advocate of the AIA, which was going to set up a paper mill in Krakow and provide new equipment for a metals industry in Riga, a cement factory in Tallinn, and so on.

<div class="line_en">As he sat there in the boat, Blomkvist filled his glass with Reimersholms brandy and leaned back, trying to remember what little he knew about Wennerström. Born up in Norrland, where in the seventies he set up an investment company. He made money and moved to Stockholm, and there his career took off in the eighties. He created Wennerström-gruppen, the Wennerström Group, when they set up offices in London and New York and the company started to get mentioned in the same articles as Beijer. He traded stock and options and liked to make quick deals, and he emerged in the celebrity press as one of Sweden's numerous billionaires with a city home on Strandvägen, a fabulous summer villa on the island of Värmdö, and an eighty-two-foot motor yacht that he bought from a bankrupt former tennis star. He was a bean counter, naturally, but the eighties was the decade of the bean counters and property speculators, and Wennerström had not made a significantly big splash. On the contrary, he had remained something of a man in the shadows among his peers. He lacked Jan Stenbeck's flamboyance and did not spread himself all over the tabloids like Percy Barnevik. He said goodbye to real estate and instead made massive investments in the former Eastern Bloc. When the bubble burst in the nineties and one managing director after another was forced to cash in his golden parachute, Wennerström's company came out of it in remarkably good shape.

<div class="line_en">"Be patient. When the project started there was no problem with financing. Sweden hadn't yet been hit by the interest-rate shock. The government was happy to plug AIA as one of the biggest Swedish efforts to promote democracy in the East."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“耐心一点。计划一开始并没有资金的问题，因为瑞典尚未遭受利率冲击，政府很乐于为AIA大力宣传，说这是瑞典为促进东欧民主所尽的最大努力之一。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Don't get politics mixed up in this. It's all about money and it makes no difference if the Social Democrats or the moderates appoint the ministers. So, full speed ahead. Then came the foreign-exchange problems, and after that some crazy New Democrats -- remember them?-- started whining that there was a shortage of oversight in what AIA was into. One of their henchmen had confused AIA with the Swedish International Development Authority and thought it was all some damn do-gooder project like the one in Tanzania. In the spring of 1994 a commission was appointed to investigate. At that time there were concerns about several projects, but one of the first to be investigated was Minos."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“别把政治给扯进来。这一切只和钱有关，不管委员会头脑是由社会民主党还是温和派人士指派，结果都一样。所以呢，全速前进就对了。后来外汇问题出现了，接着便有一些新民主党的疯子开始埋怨政府对AIA疏于监督——还记得他们吧？其中有个跳梁小丑还把AIA和瑞典国际发展合作署搞混，以为这不外乎又是一个该死的行善计划，和援助坦桑尼亚一样。一九九四年，政府派出调查小组。当时有几个计划受到关注，但首先受到调查的计划之一便是迈诺斯。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Believe me, it was a capitalist's wet dream. Russia and Eastern Europe may be the world's biggest untapped markets after China. Industry had no problem joining hands with the government, especially when the companies were required to put up only a token investment. In all, AIA swallowed about thirty billion kronor of the taxpayers' money. It was supposed to come back in future profits. Formally, AIA was the government's initiative, but the influence of industry was so great that in actual fact the AIA board was operating independently."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“相信我，资本家会为此梦遗。俄国与东欧可能是全世界仅次于中国的最大的未开发市场，产业界与政府联手并无问题，尤其是这些公司只需出点微薄资金意思意思。前前后后，AIA大概吞了纳税人三百亿克朗，这些钱以后应该都得赚回来。形式上，AIA由政府主导，但企业界的影响力太大，以至于AIA委员会实际上是独立运作。”">查看中文翻译</div>

In practice their factory was shut out by the competition from a similar German project. The Germans were doing their best to buy up the entire Eastern Bloc."</div>

But Minos had gone under and Wennerström could not be blamed for it. Here the state guarantees kicked in, and Wennerström was indemnified. All he needed to do was pay back the money that was lost when Minos went under, and he could also show that he had lost a corresponding amount of his own money."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没错，这笔钱成了无息贷款。最初当然认为这些公司会在几年内分期偿还部分金额，但迈诺斯经营失败却怪不得温纳斯壮。因为有政府的保证，免除了温纳斯壮的责任，他只需归还迈诺斯破产时亏损的钱，而且他还可以证明自己也损失了一笔数目相当的钱。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“当然。但你想想：温纳斯壮集团是个投资公司，凡是能短期获利的，如房地产、有价证券、期权、外汇等等，都属于它的业务范围。温纳斯壮在一九九二年找上AIA时，正是股市即将跌到谷底之际。你还记得一九九二年秋天吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"All right, every speculator had cash-flow problems. Look at it this way: Wennerström got sixty million kronor. He paid back six mil, but only after three years. The real cost of Minos didn't come to more than two million. The interest alone on sixty million for three years, that's quite a bit. Depending on how he invested the money, he might have doubled the AIA money, or maybe grown it ten times over. Then we're no longer talking about cat shit. Skål, by the way."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧。每个投机商都有现金流的问题。我们从这个角度来看：温纳斯壮拿到六千万克朗，虽然还了六百万，却已事隔三年。迈诺斯的实际开销不会超过两百万。光是六千万三年的利息，已经相当可观。其余的就看他怎么投资，可能让AIA的钱加倍，甚至赚了十倍以上，这可就不是什么芝麻绿豆的小事啰。干杯！”">查看中文翻译</div>
