<div class="line_en">As time went on Philip's deformity ceased to interest. It was accepted like one boy's red hair and another's unreasonable corpulence. But meanwhile he had grown horribly sensitive. He never ran if he could help it, because he knew it made his limp more conspicuous, and he adopted a peculiar walk. He stood still as much as he could, with his club-foot behind the other, so that it should not attract notice, and he was constantly on the look out for any reference to it. Because he could not join in the games which other boys played, their life remained strange to him; he only interested himself from the outside in their doings; and it seemed to him that there was a barrier between them and him. Sometimes they seemed to think that it was his fault if he could not play football, and he was unable to make them understand. He was left a good deal to himself. He had been inclined to talkativeness, but gradually he became silent. He began to think of the difference between himself and others.</div>

<div class="line_en">The biggest boy in his dormitory, Singer, took a dislike to him, and Philip, small for his age, had to put up with a good deal of hard treatment. About half-way through the term a mania ran through the school for a game called Nibs. It was a game for two, played on a table or a form with steel pens. You had to push your nib with the finger-nail so as to get the point of it over your opponent's, while he manoeuvred to prevent this and to get the point of his nib over the back of yours; when this result was achieved you breathed on the ball of your thumb, pressed it hard on the two nibs, and if you were able then to lift them without dropping either, both nibs became yours. Soon nothing was seen but boys playing this game, and the more skilful acquired vast stores of nibs. But in a little while Mr. Watson made up his mind that it was a form of gambling, forbade the game, and confiscated all the nibs in the boys" possession. Philip had been very adroit, and it was with a heavy heart that he gave up his winning; but his fingers itched to play still, and a few days later, on his way to the football field, he went into a shop and bought a pennyworth of J pens. He carried them loose in his pocket and enjoyed feeling them. Presently Singer found out that he had them. Singer had given up his nibs too, but he had kept back a very large one, called a Jumbo, which was almost unconquerable, and he could not resist the opportunity of getting Philip's Js out of him. Though Philip knew that he was at a disadvantage with his small nibs, he had an adventurous disposition and was willing to take the risk; besides, he was aware that Singer would not allow him to refuse. He had not played for a week and sat down to the game now with a thrill of excitement. He lost two of his small nibs quickly, and Singer was jubilant, but the third time by some chance the Jumbo slipped round and Philip was able to push his J across it. He crowed with triumph. At that moment Mr. Watson came in.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="宿舍里最大的孩子辛格不喜欢菲利普。就年龄来说，菲利普的个儿算是矮小的，他得经常忍受各种虐待。大约过了半个学期，学校里出现一股“笔”游戏的热潮。这是种双人游戏，用钢笔尖在桌子或长凳上斗着玩。玩的人须用指甲推动自己的一只笔尖，设法让它迎着对手的笔尖头爬上去；而对手一面招架防备，一面也竭力设法使自己的笔尖迎头爬上对方的笔尖背。谁成功了，就在自己拇指向球上呵口气，然后用力按这两只笔尖，假如能把它们粘住，同时提起来，那么，这两只笔尖就属于赢者的了。没多久，学校里净看见学生们在玩这种游戏，那些心灵手巧的孩子赢得了大量笔尖。过了一阵子，沃森先生认定这是一种赌博，断然禁止这种游戏，并把学生手里的笔尖全部充公。这种游戏菲利普玩得挺得心应手，结果也只好忍痛割爱，交出全部战利品。但是，他手指痒痒的，总想再过过痛。几天以后，他在去足球场途中，跑进一家商店，花了一个便士，买了几枚丁字形钢笔尖。他把这些笔尖散放在口袋里，摸着过瘾。辛格很快发现菲利普手头有这些笔尖。辛格的笔尖也上缴了，但是他偷偷留下一只封号“大”的特大笔尖，这只笔尖几乎是常胜将军。这会儿，他怎么也不愿坐失良机，非要把菲利普的丁字形笔尖赢到手不可。菲利普尽管明明知道用自己的小笔尖和他对阵，无异是以卵击石，但他生性爱冒险，所以还是愿意背水一战。再说他也明白，要是自己拒绝比赛，辛格决不肯善罢甘休。他已经歇手了一个星期，现在坐下来重新挥戈上阵，心头止不住一阵兴奋。菲利普一下子就输掉了两只小笔尖，辛格乐得眉开眼笑。可是第三次交锋时，辛格“大”不知怎么地突然一个滑转，菲利普乘机把他的丁字形笔尖推上“大”脊背。他由于得胜而欢呼起来。就在这时，沃森先生一脚跨了进来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For the rest of the term he tormented Philip cruelly, and, though Philip tried to keep out of his way, the school was so small that it was impossible; he tried being friendly and jolly with him; he abased himself, so far as to buy him a knife; but though Singer took the knife he was not placated. Once or twice, driven beyond endurance, he hit and kicked the bigger boy, but Singer was so much stronger that Philip was helpless, and he was always forced after more or less torture to beg his pardon. It was that which rankled with Philip: he could not bear the humiliation of apologies, which were wrung from him by pain greater than he could bear. And what made it worse was that there seemed no end to his wretchedness; Singer was only eleven and would not go to the upper school till he was thirteen. Philip realised that he must live two years with a tormentor from whom there was no escape. He was only happy while he was working and when he got into bed. And often there recurred to him then that queer feeling that his life with all its misery was nothing but a dream, and that he would awake in the morning in his own little bed in London.</div>
