Pa, he 'lowed he'd break up and go down and live with Uncle Ben, who's got a little one-horse place on the river, forty-four mile below Orleans. Pa was pretty poor, and had some debts; so when he'd squared up there warn't nothing left but sixteen dollars and our nigger, Jim. That warn't enough to take us fourteen hundred mile, deck passage nor no other way. Well, when the river rose pa had a streak of luck one day; he ketched this piece of a raft; so we reckoned we'd go down to Orleans on it. Pa's luck didn't hold out; a steamboat run over the forrard corner of the raft one night, and we all went overboard and dove under the wheel; Jim and me come up all right, but pa was drunk, and Ike was only four years old, so they never come up no more. Well, for the next day or two we had considerable trouble, because people was always coming out in skiffs and trying to take Jim away from me, saying they believed he was a runaway nigger. We don't run daytimes no more now; nights they don't bother us."</div>

My bed was a straw tickÑbetter than Jim's, which was a cornshuck tick; there's always cobs around about in a shuck tick, and they poke into you and hurt; and when you roll over the dry shucks sound like you was rolling over in a pile of dead leaves; it makes such a rustling that you wake up.

<div class="line_en">We got away as soon as it was good and dark. The king told us to stand well out towards the middle of the river, and not show a light till we got a long ways below the town. We come in sight of the little bunch of lights by and by – that was the town, you know – and slid by, about a half a mile out, all right. When we was three-quarters of a mile below we hoisted up our signal lantern; and about ten o'clock it come on to rain and blow and thunder and lighten like everything; so the king told us to both stay on watch till the weather got better; then him and the duke crawled into the wigwam and turned in for the night. It was my watch below till twelve, but I wouldn't a turned in anyway if I'd had a bed, because a body don't see such a storm as that every day in the week, not by a long sight. My souls, how the wind did scream along! And every second or two there'd come a glare that lit up the white-caps for a half a mile around, and you'd see the islands looking dusty through the rain, and the trees thrashing around in the wind; then comes a H-WHACK! – bum! bum! bumble-umble-um-bum-bum-bum-bum – and the thunder would go rumbling and grumbling away, and quit – and then RIP comes another flash and another sockdolager. The waves most washed me off the raft sometimes, but I hadn't any clothes on, and didn't mind. We didn't have no trouble about snags; the lightning was glaring and flittering around so constant that we could see them plenty soon enough to throw her head this way or that and miss them.</div>

<div class="line_en">The king got out an old ratty deck of cards after breakfast, and him and the duke played seven-up a while, five cents a game. Then they got tired of it, and allowed they would "lay out a campaign," as they called it. The duke went down into his carpetbag, and fetched up a lot of little printed bills and read them out loud. One bill said, "The celebrated Dr. Armand de Montalban, of Paris," would "lecture on the Science of Phrenology" at such and such a place, on the blank day of blank, at ten cents admission, and "furnish charts of character at twenty-five cents apiece." The duke said that was HIM. In another bill he was the "world-renowned Shakespearian tragedian, Garrick the Younger, of Drury Lane, London." In other bills he had a lot of other names and done other wonderful things, like finding water and gold with a "divining-rod," "dissipating witch spells," and so on. By and by he says:</div>

I crawled into the wigwam, but the king and the duke had their legs sprawled around so there warn't no show for me; so I laid outside – I didn't mind the rain, because it was warm, and the waves warn't running so high now. About two they come up again, though, and Jim was going to call me; but he changed his mind, because he reckoned they warn't high enough yet to do any harm; but he was mistaken about that, for pretty soon all of a sudden along comes a regular ripper and washed me overboard. It most killed Jim a-laughing. He was the easiest nigger to laugh that ever was, anyway.</div>

<div class="line_en">The first shed we come to the preacher was lining out a hymn. He lined out two lines, everybody sung it, and it was kind of grand to hear it, there was so many of them and they done it in such a rousing way; then he lined out two more for them to sing – and so on. The people woke up more and more, and sung louder and louder; and towards the end some begun to groan, and some begun to shout. Then the preacher begun to preach, and begun in earnest, too; and went weaving first to one side of the platform and then the other, and then a-leaning down over the front of it, with his arms and his body going all the time, and shouting his words out with all his might; and every now and then he would hold up his Bible and spread it open, and kind of pass it around this way and that, shouting, "It's the brazen serpent in the wilderness! Look upon it and live!" And people would shout out, "Glory! – A-a-MEN!" And so he went on, and the people groaning and crying and saying amen:</div>

<div class="line_en">Well, the first I knowed the king got a-going, and you could hear him over everybody; and next he went a-charging up on to the platform, and the preacher he begged him to speak to the people, and he done it. He told them he was a pirate – been a pirate for thirty years out in the Indian Ocean – and his crew was thinned out considerable last spring in a fight, and he was home now to take out some fresh men, and thanks to goodness he'd been robbed last night and put ashore off of a steamboat without a cent, and he was glad of it; it was the blessedest thing that ever happened to him, because he was a changed man now, and happy for the first time in his life; and, poor as he was, he was going to start right off and work his way back to the Indian Ocean, and put in the rest of his life trying to turn the pirates into the true path; for he could do it better than anybody else, being acquainted with all pirate crews in that ocean; and though it would take him a long time to get there without money, he would get there anyway, and every time he convinced a pirate he would say to him, "Don't you thank me, don't you give me no credit; it all belongs to them dear people in Pokeville campmeeting, natural brothers and benefactors of the race, and that dear preacher there, the truest friend a pirate ever had!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="啊，我一眼就看到国王正在跑过去。你听得到他那压倒一切人的声音。接着，他一抬腿就走上了讲台，牧师请他对大家讲话，他也就讲了。他对大家说，他是一个海盗——已有三十年历史的海盗，远在印度洋之上。在春天一次战斗中，他部下的人损失惨重。如今他已回了国，想招募一批新人。昨晚上，他不幸遭到了抢劫，被赶下了轮船，落得身无分文。他对这个遭遇倒是很高兴，认为该谢天谢地，看作是平生一大好事。因为，如今嘛，他已经是变了一个人，平生第一回真正感到了什么叫做幸福。尽管他如今确实很穷，但是他主意已定，要立即设法返回印度洋，以此余生，尽力劝导那些海盗走上正道。干这样的一件事，他能比任何人做得更好，因为他和纵横印度洋上的海盗全都非常熟悉。尽管他远途前往，要花很多时间，加上自己又身无分文，他反正要到达那里的。他要不放过每一个机会，对被他劝说悔改过来的每一个海盗说，“你们不必感谢我，你们不用把功劳记在我的名下，一切功劳归于朴克维尔露营布道会的亲人们，人类中天生的兄弟和恩人们——还应归功于那里亲爱的传教师，一个海盗们最最真诚的朋友！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And so on. You couldn't make out what the preacher said any more, on account of the shouting and crying. Folks got up everywheres in the crowd, and worked their way just by main strength to the mourners' bench, with the tears running down their faces; and when all the mourners had got up there to the front benches in a crowd, they sung and shouted and flung themselves down on the straw, just crazy and wild.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布道会就是如此这般地进行着。由于一片吼叫、哭喊声，布道的人在说些什么，你就无法听清。一堆堆人群里，人们站起身来，全凭力气，挤着出来，挤到了那一排悔罪的板凳这边来，脸上流着泪水。等到一群悔罪的人全都到了这排悔罪的板凳那里，他们就唱了起来，吼了起来，并且扑倒在面前的稻草上，简直就疯狂了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And then he busted into tears, and so did everybody. Then somebody sings out, "Take up a collection for him, take up a collection!" Well, a half a dozen made a jump to do it, but somebody sings out, "Let HIM pass the hat around!" Then everybody said it, the preacher too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说着说着，他哇哇地哭了，大家也一个个哭了。这时有人高声叫喊：“给他凑一笔钱，凑一笔钱！”刚说过，就有五六个人争着干开了，不过有一个人喊道：“让他托一顶帽子转一圈凑这笔钱吧！”接着一个个都这么说，传教师也这么说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So the king went all through the crowd with his hat swabbing his eyes, and blessing the people and praising them and thanking them for being so good to the poor pirates away off there; and every little while the prettiest kind of girls, with the tears running down their cheeks, would up and ask him would he let them kiss him for to remember him by; and he always done it; and some of them he hugged and kissed as many as five or six times – and he was invited to stay a week; and everybody wanted him to live in their houses, and said they'd think it was an honor; but he said as this was the last day of the camp-meeting he couldn't do no good, and besides he was in a sweat to get to the Indian Ocean right off and go to work on the pirates.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以国王就托着他的帽子在人群前走了一圈，一边抹眼睛，一边为大伙儿祝福，并且感谢大家对远在海上的海盗如此仁义。每隔一会儿，就会有最美丽的姑娘泪流满面，走上前来，问他能不能让她亲亲他，作为对他的一个永久的纪念。他呢，有求必应。有些漂亮姑娘，他又搂又亲了五六回之多。——人家又邀请他多留一个星期，大家一个个都愿邀请他到他们家住，还说，他们认为这是一个光荣。不过他说，既然今天已是露营布道会的最后一天，他留下来没有什么用了。再说，他恨不得马上到印度洋去，好感化那些海盗。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When we got back to the raft and he come to count up he found he had collected eighty-seven dollars and seventy-five cents. And then he had fetched away a three-gallon jug of whisky, too, that he found under a wagon when he was starting home through the woods. The king said, take it all around, it laid over any day he'd ever put in in the missionarying line. He said it warn't no use talking, heathens don't amount to shucks alongside of pirates to work a camp-meeting with.</div>

<div class="line_en">The duke was thinking HE'D been doing pretty well till the king come to show up, but after that he didn't think so so much. He had set up and printed off two little jobs for farmers in that printing-office – horse bills – and took the money, four dollars. And he had got in ten dollars' worth of advertisements for the paper, which he said he would put in for four dollars if they would pay in advance – so they done it. The price of the paper was two dollars a year, but he took in three subscriptions for half a dollar apiece on condition of them paying him in advance; they were going to pay in cordwood and onions as usual, but he said he had just bought the concern and knocked down the price as low as he could afford it, and was going to run it for cash. He set up a little piece of poetry, which he made, himself, out of his own head – three verses – kind of sweet and saddish – the name of it was, "Yes, crush, cold world, this breaking heart" – and he left that all set up and ready to print in the paper, and didn't charge nothing for it. Well, he took in nine dollars and a half, and said he'd done a pretty square day's work for it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="公爵呢，本来自以为他干得挺不错。等到国王讲了他怎样露了一手以后，他这才不那么想了。他在那家印刷店接了活，为农民干了两件小小的活，——印了出售马匹的招贴。还收了钱：四块钱。他还代收了报纸广告费十元。他还宣传说，如果预付，四元即可，人家也就按此办法付了钱。报费原是两块钱一年，他收了三个订户，按照他的规定，凡是预付，只收五角钱一年。订户原本想按老规矩，用木柴、洋葱头折现付款。可是他说，他刚盘下这家店，把价钱定得低而又低，无法再低了，所以贷款一律付现。他还写了一首小诗，是他自己发了诗兴写的——一共三首——是那种既甜美又带点儿悲凉的——有一首诗的题目是：“啊，冷酷的世界，碾碎这颗伤透了的心吧”。他临走前，把这首诗排好了铅字，随时可以印出，登在报上，分文不取。他得了九块半大洋，还说，为了这点儿钱，他干了整整一天。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then he showed us another little job he'd printed and hadn't charged for, because it was for us. It had a picture of a runaway nigger with a bundle on a stick over his shoulder, and "$200 reward" under it. The reading was all about Jim, and just described him to a dot. It said he run away from St. Jacques' plantation, forty mile below New Orleans, last winter, and likely went north, and whoever would catch him and send him back he could have the reward and expenses.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随后他给我们看了他印的另一件小小的活计，也不要钱，因为这是为我们印的。那是一幅画，画的是一个逃亡的黑奴，肩膀上杠一根木棍，上面挑着一只包裹。黑奴像下面写着“悬赏大洋两百元”。这都是写的杰姆，写得一丝一毫也不差。上面写道，此人从圣·雅克农庄潜逃，农庄在新奥尔良下游四十英里地，潜逃时间是去年冬天。说很可能是往北逃，凡能捉拿住并送回者，当付重酬云云。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Now," says the duke, "after to-night we can run in the daytime if we want to. Whenever we see anybody coming we can tie Jim hand and foot with a rope, and lay him in the wigwam and show this handbill and say we captured him up the river, and were too poor to travel on a steamboat, so we got this little raft on credit from our friends and are going down to get the reward. Handcuffs and chains would look still better on Jim, but it wouldn't go well with the story of us being so poor. Too much like jewelry. Ropes are the correct thing – we must preserve the unities, as we say on the boards."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“如今啊”，公爵说道，“在今晚上以后，只要我们高兴，就不妨在白天行驶了。见到有人来，我们就用一根绳子，把杰姆从头到脚捆绑好，放在窝棚里，把这张招贴给人家看看，说我们是在上游把他给抓住的，说我们太穷，坐不起轮船，所以凭我们的朋友作保，买下了这个木筏子，正开往下游去领那个赏金。给杰姆戴上个脚镣手铐，也许更象个样子，不过和我们很穷这个说法不很相称。那就象戴上珠宝一类很不相称了。用绳子，那是恰到好处——正如我们在戏台上说的，‘三一律’非得遵守不可啊。”">查看中文翻译</div>
