<div class="line_en">Bod wandered over to the northwestern part of the graveyard, to the tangle of ivy that hung from a yew tree and half-blocked the far exit from the Egyptian Walk. He saw a red fox and a large black cat, with a white collar and paws, who sat conversing together in the middle of the path. At Bod's approach they looked up, startled, then fled into the undergrowth, as if they had been caught conspiring.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伯蒂晃悠到坟场西北边，走向紫杉树下挡住埃及路出口的一大丛常春藤。他看见一只红色狐狸和一只黑色大猫，猫颈部和爪子上的毛是白色的。正在路中间交头接耳的狐狸和猫一见伯蒂靠近，吓得立马蹿进灌木丛，仿佛被人撞破了密谋。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Bod started to slip through the ivy but he found his way blocked. He bent down, pushed the ivy out of the way and squeezed through. He walked down the path carefully, avoiding the ruts and holes until he reached the impressive stone that marked the final resting place of Alonso Tomás Garcia Jones (1837-1905, Traveler Lay Down Thy Staff).</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伯蒂想穿过缠结的常春藤，却过不去。他弯下腰，推开挡道的常春藤，用力挤了过去。他小心翼翼地走在路上，避开车辙和坑洞，来到一块华丽的墓碑前。这块墓碑标志着阿隆索·托马斯·加西亚·琼斯（1837—1905，旅人放下了旅杖）的安息之地。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Bod walked over to the pointed stone -- tall, carved with upside-down torches, and he waited, but saw no one. He called to Alonso Jones, even knocked on the side of the stone, but there was no response. Bod leaned down, to push his head into the grave and call his friend, but instead of his head slipping though the solid matter like a shadow passing through a deeper shadow, his head met the ground with a hard and painful thump. He called again, but saw nothing and no one, and, carefully, he made his way out of the tangle of greenery and of grey stones and back to the path. Three magpies perched in a hawthorn tree took wing as he passed them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伯蒂走向高大耸立，带尖顶，雕刻有许多束朝下的火炬的墓碑，等啊等，可一个人也没看到。他呼喊“阿隆索·琼斯”的名字，甚至敲了敲墓碑侧面，也没听到回应。伯蒂弯下腰，想探进墓室喊他的朋友，可他的脑袋没有像过去那样，如同一片阴影穿透一片更深的阴影般顺畅无阻地穿过固体，而是狠狠地撞在地上，疼得要命。他又喊了一声，可什么都没看见。他再度小心翼翼地穿过那片绿植和灰色墓碑纠缠在一起的地带，回到原路上，惊动了停在山楂树上的三只喜鹊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Bod had been coming down here every few days for several months: Alonso Jones had been all over the world, and he took great pleasure in telling Bod stories of his travels. He would begin by saying, "Nothing interesting has ever happened to me," then would add, gloomily, "and I have told you all my tales," and then his eyes would flash, and he would remark, "Except… did I ever tell you about…?" And whatever the next words were: "The time I had to escape from Moscow?" or "The time I lost an Alaskan gold mine, worth a fortune?" or "The cattle stampede on the pampas?," Bod would always shake his head and look expectant and soon enough his head would be swimming with tales of derring-do and high adventure, tales of beautiful maidens kissed, of evildoers shot with pistols or fought with swords, of bags of gold, of diamonds as big as the tip of your thumb, of lost cities and of vast mountains, of steam-trains and clipper ships, of pampas, oceans, deserts, tundra.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这几个月，他隔三岔五会来这里：阿隆索·琼斯游历过世界各地，他很喜欢给伯蒂讲自己的旅行见闻。一开始他会说：“其实我也没遇到过什么有趣的事…”接着他会忧郁地说：“我所有的故事都和你讲过了。”之后，他会眼睛一亮，话锋一转：“不过…我有没有和你讲过…”无论他接下来要讲什么，无论是“我从莫斯科逃走的故事？”或“我失去了阿拉斯加一处价值连城的金矿？”或“潘帕斯草原上狂奔的野牛？”伯蒂都会摇摇头，一脸期待地听他往下讲。过不了多久，他的小脑袋瓜就会填满勇往直前的故事、激动人心的冒险、被亲吻的美丽少女、与子弹或兵刃缠斗的坏蛋、一袋袋金子、拇指那么大的钻石、失落的城市、崇山峻岭、蒸汽火车、飞剪帆船、潘帕斯草原、海洋、沙漠和苔原。">查看中文翻译</div>

Though I still feel the same as I always did," Bod said, but Mother Slaughter interrupted, "And I still feels like I done when I was a tiny slip of a thing, making daisy chains in the old pasture. You're always you, and that don't change, and you're always changing, and there's nothing you can do about it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“大概十五岁吧，但我仍觉得我和以前一个样。”屠杀之母打断了他：“我也依然觉得自己是那个在老牧场上编织雏菊花环的小姑娘。你还是你，这一点没有改变，但你又一直在变化，对此你怎么做都无法阻止。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She sat down on her broken stone, and said, "I remember you the night you came here, boy. I says, 'We can't let the little fellow leave,' and your mother agrees, and all of them starts argufying and what-not until the Lady on the Grey rides up. 'People of the Graveyard,' she says, 'Listen to Mother Slaughter. Have you not got any charity in your bones?' and then all of them agreed with me." She trailed off, shook her little head, "There's not much happens here to make one day unlike the next. The seasons change. The ivy grows. Stones fall over. But you coming here… well, I'm glad you did, that's all."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="屠杀之母坐到自己残破的墓碑上，说：“孩子，我记得你来这里的那一夜。我说‘我们不能丢下这个小不点不管’，你妈妈和我看法一致，其他人则就要不要留下你开始争论不休，直到骑灰马的女士到来。她说‘坟场的各位，请听屠杀之母的话，你们骨子里还有一点慈悲之心吗？’接着所有人都赞同了我的看法。”屠杀之母顿了下，摇了摇头，“这儿不会发生什么特别的事，日复一日，每天都一个样。四季交替，常春藤生长，墓碑倒塌。可你到来了…你能来，我很高兴，我想说的仅此而已。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She stood up and pulled a grubby piece of linen from her sleeve, spat on it, and reached up as high as she could and scrubbed the blood from Bod's forehead.

<div class="line_en">"Already?" said Silas. He sighed. Bod heard a velvet rustle, then a match was struck, and it flamed, and was used to light two huge candles that sat on great carved wooden candlesticks at the back of the room. In the candlelight, Bod could see his guardian standing beside a large leather chest, of the kind they call a steamer trunk -- big enough that a tall man could have curled up and slept inside it. Beside it was Silas's black leather bag, which Bod had seen before, on a handful of occasions, but which he still found impressive.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“已经什么都看不见了吗？”赛拉斯叹了口气。伯蒂听到天鹅绒的摩挲声，接着一根火柴被擦亮，闪动的火苗点亮了屋子内部精雕细刻的烛台上的两根大蜡烛。借着烛光，伯蒂看到赛拉斯站在一个大皮箱边上，这种款式的皮箱被人们称作轮船衣箱——大到能容下一个人蜷在里面睡觉。大皮箱边是赛拉斯日常携带的黑色皮箱，伯蒂见过几次，仍觉得这个箱子不同寻常。">查看中文翻译</div>

Her voice said, "I will miss you too. Always."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你真傻，”丽萨低语，伯蒂感觉到她握住了自己的手，“傻到对不起生命。”丽萨吻了吻他的脸颊、他的嘴角。她吻得那么温柔，让伯蒂困惑不解，不知所措。丽萨的声音说：“我也会想你，永远。”">查看中文翻译</div>
