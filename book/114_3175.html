<div class="line_en">Our coffee and cigars were finished. I knew that tomorrow -- or was it today? It was well past midnight -- the inquiry judges would take up the weapon of the law and punish Jim. I told myself repeatedly that the young man was guilty, but I wanted to help him get away. My friends, if you can't understand my reasons, you haven't been listening to me all this time.</div>

<div class="line_en">So I suggested Brierly's plan of escape to Jim. I would lend him some money -- he could pay it back when he liked -- and I would also write a letter to a friend of mine in Rangoon, who would give him a job. Jim could leave that same day, and save himself the shame of the final day in the crowded courthouse. I was impatient to begin writing the letter immediately. But Jim refused.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我向吉姆建议了布赖尔利的逃跑计划。我表示能借给他一些钱——他什么时候还都可以——我还会给仰光的一个朋友写信，请他给吉姆一份工作，吉姆可以在当天离开，逃过最后一天在法庭上众目睽睽下蒙受的屈辱。我迫不及待想马上动笔写信，但吉姆拒绝了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I am sure that things looked terribly uncertain to him at that moment, but he did not hesitate. He was young and strong, and there was something fine in his wild hope that he would survive.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes, it is, it is," he whispered, his eyes fixed on the floor. The way he spoke touched me to the heart. "The captain escaped -- the others went to hospital -- they all got away…" He waved them scornfully away with his hand. "But I've got to accept this thing. I'm not going to avoid any of it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对，是的，是的。”他低声说，眼睛盯着地面。他说话的样子触动了我。“船长逃走了——其余人都躲进了医院——他们都跑了……”他轻蔑地挥着手，“但我必须承担这件事。我不会逃避任何处罚。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You don't understand," he replied, looking straight into my eyes. "I jumped, but I don't run away."</div>

<div class="line_en">And then, as we said goodbye, he stupidly imagined that I did not want to shake hands with him. First he offered his hand, then pulled back, then hesitated, then -- it was too awful for words. I had to shout at him, "Jim! Shake hands with me, man!" Finally it was over, and he disappeared into the night. I heard his heavy footsteps. He was running, with nowhere to go to. And he was only twenty-three.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是我们道别，他傻傻地认为我不想和他握手。他先主动伸出手，然后又缩了回去，犹豫了一会儿，然后——真是说不出的别扭。我不得不对他喊道：“吉姆！和我握握手吧，小伙子！”一切结束后，他消失在夜色中。我听见他沉重的脚步声。他奔跑着，却无处可去，而他才23岁。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Next morning, the last day of the inquiry, I was in court again. It was really very wrong of me, because my chief mate was expecting me to visit my ship, but I had to know what would happen to Jim. Outside, the streets were full of colour and bright sunshine, but the courtroom was dark and airless. Jim stood there, pink and fair and serious, while the judge spoke. "This court has decided that the officers of the Patna, who were responsible for all the ship's passengers, were guilty of forgetting their clear duty, when they left the ship in the moment of danger. The court has therefore decided to take away the master's certificates of the captain and chief mate."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="次日是审判的最后一天，我一大早就到了法庭。我不该这么做，因为我的大副在等我去船上看看，但是我必须知道吉姆会怎么样。法庭外阳光灿烂，街道上五彩斑斓，但法庭里光线很暗，空气也不畅通。吉姆站在那儿，白皙的脸涨红了，一副严肃的表情。法官宣判：“法庭判决帕特纳号的船员有罪，他们对船上所有的乘客负有责任，然而在船只遇险时，他们却忘记了自己明确的职责，弃船而去，法庭因此决定吊销船长和大副的执照。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I stared at him in horror. I knew the place he was talking about. There was no water on the island and very little rain fell there. I had a sudden picture of Jim on a shadowless rock, up to his knees in guano, with the screams of seabirds in his ears, and the sun beating down on his head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我惊恐地看着他。我知道他说的地方。那个岛上没有水，也很少下雨。我的眼前突然出现了一个画面：吉姆站在光秃秃的礁石上，踩着没膝的鸟粪，耳边是海鸟的尖叫，烈日照在他的头上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That young man's no good, is he?" he said. "But I can give him a job. I've discovered a guano island among the Walpole rocks which is going to make me rich. It's rocky, and a bit dangerous to land there. I can't get anybody to take the job, but I need a man to do the work there for me. I don't care if he's a bit of a coward, or hasn't got his certificate. He'll have forty natives to collect the guano, and I'll give him a couple of guns, of course. You could persuade him to take the job, Marlow, couldn't you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那个年轻人不怎么样，对吧？”他说，“但是我能给他一份工作。我在沃波尔暗礁区发现了一个鸟粪岛，它能让我发财。那里暗礁很多，在那儿登陆有点儿危险。我找不到愿意做这份工作的人，但是我需要一个人在那儿为我工作。我不介意他是不是懦夫，有没有执照。他要带着四十个当地人去收集鸟粪，当然我还会给他几杆枪。你能劝说他接受这份工作吗，马洛？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The room was silent, then people started to leave. I saw Jim, his face as black as thunder, walking out slowly and a little uncertainly. As I was watching him, a man called Chester spoke to me. I knew him a little. He was a West Australian who normally traded in the Pacific, but had come here looking for a cheap ship to buy. He watched Jim walking away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="屋子里静悄悄的，人们渐渐散去。我看见了吉姆，他脸色阴沉，脚步迟疑地慢慢朝外走去。当我正看着吉姆的时候，一个名叫切斯特的人跟我说起了话。我对此人略知一二，他是澳大利亚西部人，常在太平洋一带做生意，他来这儿是想买一只便宜的船。他看着吉姆走出去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He spent the rest of the day in my room, where he stood looking out on the veranda, while I sat at my desk, busily writing letters. We did not speak to each other. I wrote all the letters I owed people, and then I wrote to people who would certainly be surprised to receive a letter from me. It became dark, and still I went on writing. It was clear that he was very unhappy. Occasionally I saw his strong shoulders shaking, and I was glad his family could not see him like that. Suddenly, with a crash, he pushed open the glass door on to the veranda, and stepped out into the blackness, standing there like a lonely figure by a dark and hopeless sea. I began to think he was taking it all too seriously. Should I persuade him to accept Chester's offer? I knew there was nothing except myself between him and the dark sea. But I said nothing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他在我的房间度过了那一天余下的时光，他站在那里看着外面的阳台；我坐在桌前忙着写信。我们相互没有说话。我把欠着别人的信全写完了，之后又写了几封信给其他几个人，这些人收到我的信一定会无比惊讶。我一直写到天黑。吉姆显然很不开心。我不时看见他宽厚的肩膀颤抖着，幸好他的家人看不到他这个样子。突然，“砰”的一声，他推开通往阳台的玻璃门，走到黑暗中，站在那儿，像黑暗、无望的大海上的一个孤影。我感觉他把这一切看得太严重了。我应该劝他接受切斯特提供的机会吗？我知道，在他和黑暗的大海之间，除了我再没有别的了。但我什么都没说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I hurried down to the waterside, and found Jim looking miserably at the sea. He didn't hear me come up, but turned quickly when I touched his shoulder. He followed me back to the hotel obediently. I realized that he had nowhere in the whole world where he could be alone with his suffering.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我快步走到海边，发现吉姆正忧郁地望着大海。他没听见我走过来，但我碰了碰他的肩膀，他很快就转过身。他顺从地跟着我回到酒店。我知道，他在这个世界上找不到什么地方去独自承受他的痛苦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's just the job for him." Chester smiled unpleasantly. "I can promise the island wouldn't sink under him -- and I believe he's a bit sensitive on that question."</div>

<div class="line_en">The time was coming when I would hear him described as a hero. It's true, I tell you. Towards the end, he found honour and a perfect happiness in the Malaysian jungle. When I saw him for the last time, a few years later, he was completely in control, strong and successful, loved and trusted by the natives of Patusan. But that is not the way I remember him. I shall always see his lonely, shaking figure on that hotel veranda, suffering in the darkness.</div>

"Thank you -- for letting me -- here in your room -- nowhere else to go." The rain was falling heavily on the veranda by now. "Well -- goodbye," he said, and turned to go.</div>

<div class="line_en">My friend not only employed Jim, but welcomed him into his house. Unfortunately, only a year later, the second engineer from the Patna arrived unexpectedly in Rangoon, and Jim decided to leave the port at once. I was extremely disappointed to hear this, but helped Jim to find a second job in a port a thousand kilometres south of there. His new employers thought a lot of Jim, and trusted him with all their business. But one day the name of the Patna was mentioned, and Jim was too sensitive to bear it. Again, he left the place immediately. From now on, he moved from port to port to find work, trying to hide his terrible secret, until someone who knew the story spoke of it, and then he moved on again. I felt responsible for him, and helped and encouraged him as much as I could, but I knew that he was losing confidence in himself, although he was always cheerful and polite to me. What would be the end of it all? How long could Jim go on running away from his past?</div>

<div class="line_en">I decided to ask for advice from someone I trusted more than most men. He was a rich German trader called Stein, who had a large business buying and selling all kinds of things in the islands, ports and jungle villages of the East. He was tall and thin, with a sympathetic, intelligent face, and white hair brushed back from a high forehead. Although his life had been long and adventurous, he now spent most of his time studying and collecting butterflies. In fact, by now he had become a world-famous collector. He was liked by everyone, for the bravery of his past, and the kindness he showed to all of us.</div>

And so it is painful when he opens his eyes, to find he cannot make his dream come true. It is terrible for him. But you ask me -- how to live?" His voice sounded suddenly strong and confident.
