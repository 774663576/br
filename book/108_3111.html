<div class="line_en">Ove waits till after breakfast, once he's let the cat out. Only then does he take down a plastic bottle from the top shelf in the bathroom. He weighs it in his hand as if he's about to throw it somewhere, rattles it lightly to see if many pills are left.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维一直等到早餐后，猫咪自觉地出了门，去解决生理需要。这时候，他从浴室一个柜子的最上方拿下一个塑料瓶子。他用手掂量着，就像要把它往哪儿一扔。轻轻上下晃了几下，想要判断里面有多少粒。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He hears something outside the front door -- the cat is back surprisingly quickly, scraping its paws by the threshold and sounding like it's been caught in a steel trap. As if it knows what's going through Ove's mind. Ove can understand that it's disappointed in him. He can't possibly expect it to understand his actions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他听见门外有动静。猫回来早了，站在那儿喵呜，见没人给它开门，就开始在门槛上磨爪子，就好像它有什么预感。欧维明白它是对他失望了，他也不指望它能理解。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Towards the end the doctors prescribed so many painkillers for Sonja. Their bathroom still looks like a storage facility for the Colombian mafia. Ove obviously doesn't trust medicine, has always been convinced its only real effects are psychological and, as a result, it only works on people with feeble brains.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到后来，医生给索雅开了那么多止疼片。到现在，他们的浴室看起来还像某个哥伦比亚毒枭的储藏室。欧维其实一点都不喜欢药物，他不信任它们，总是觉得它们唯一的疗效就是心理安慰，所以只对那些意志薄弱的人才有效。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He thinks about how it would feel, doing it this way. He has never taken any narcotics. Has hardly even been affected by alcohol. Has never liked the feeling of losing control. He's come to realize over the years that it's this very feeling that normal folk like and strive for, but as far as Ove is concerned only a complete bloody airhead could find loss of control a state worth aiming for. He wonders if he'll feel nauseated, if he'll feel pain when his body's organs give up and stop functioning. Or will he just go to sleep when his body becomes unfit for use?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他揣测着止疼药过量会是什么感觉。他从来没吸过毒，连喝酒都从没醉过哪怕一次，从来不喜欢失去控制的感觉。这些年来，他渐渐明白这正是大部分普通人喜欢并追求的感觉，但就欧维看来，只有他妈十足的笨蛋才会把失控作为一种体验来追求。他不知道自己会不会难受，当身体器官开始衰竭并停止工作的时候，他是会有所感觉还是会麻木地昏睡过去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He unscrews the lid and distributes the pills along the edge of the washbasin. Watches them as if expecting them to transform into little murderous robots. Of course they don't. Ove is unimpressed. He finds it quite inexplicable how those little white dots could do him any harm, regardless of how many of them he takes. The cat sounds as if it's spitting snow all over Ove's front door. But then it's interrupted by another, quite different sound.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他拧下瓶盖，把药片倒到手掌边缘，注视着，就像在等它们变形为杀手机器人。它们就是不肯变。欧维不满意。他不理解这些小白点子怎么可能伤害到他，不管吞多少片。猫听上去在往欧维的门上扔雪球，但响动被另一种声音打断了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">By now, the cat is howling out there in the snow. Ove closes his eyes and thinks of Sonja. It's not that he's the sort of man who gives up and dies; he doesn't want her to think that. But it's actually wrong, all this. She married him. And now he doesn't quite know how to carry on without the tip of her nose in the pit between his throat and his shoulder. That's all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="猫在门外的雪地上哀号着。欧维闭上眼睛想着索雅。他并不是那种轻言放弃寻死觅活的人，他可不想让她这样以为。但这其实是她的错，是她嫁给了他。如今，他不知道没有她的鼻尖抵在他的脖子和肩膀间该怎么入睡。仅此而已。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ove stands there gripping the washbasin. Closes his eyes as if he could blink the sound out. It doesn't work. Then at last he sighs and straightens up. Unscrews the lid of the bottle, pushes the pills back into it. Goes down the stairs. As he crosses the living room he puts the jar on the windowsill. And through the window he sees Blond Weed in the road, taking aim and then rushing towards the cat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维站在那儿，抓紧洗手池，闭上眼睛，好像这样做就可以把声音关在思想之外。做不到。最后他叹了口气，站直身体，打开瓶盖，倒回那些药片。下楼梯穿过客厅时，顺手把药瓶放在了窗框上。透过窗户，他看见金发霉女站在两幢房子之间。她瞅准目标，朝猫咪冲了过去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ove opens the door exactly as she's about to kick the animal in the head with all her strength. The cat quickly dodges her needle-sharp heel and backs away towards Ove's toolshed. Mutt growls hysterically, saliva flying around its head as if it were a rabies-infected beast. There's fur in its jaws. This is the first time Ove can remember having seen Weed without her sunglasses. Malevolence glitters in her green eyes. She pulls back, preparing for another kick, then catches sight of Ove and stops herself midflow. Her lower lip is trembling with anger.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维打开门那一刹那，正赶上她全力想朝小畜生头上飞一脚。说时迟，那时快，猫咪一低头，恰躲过她芒刺般的鞋跟，赶紧朝欧维的储藏室撤退。霉女的“雪地靴”号得那叫一个惨烈，口水在脸盘周围飞溅，跟染了狂犬病似的。它的嘴角有些毛皮。欧维意识到，这是他第一次看到不戴墨镜的霉女。恶意在那双碧眼中闪烁，她摆开架势，打算再来上一脚，但就在这时看见了欧维，动作僵在中途。她的下嘴唇因气愤颤抖不止。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="欧维站在原地喘大气。他把紧握的拳头放到胸口，感觉心脏失控地怦动着，短促地哼了一声。他看看猫，猫也看看他。它的侧面多了处新伤，皮毛又沾上了血。">查看中文翻译</div>

Only now does it strike him that he's positioned the photographs so they follow him through the house wherever he goes. She's on the table in the kitchen, hangs on the wall in the hall and halfway up the stairs. She's on the window shelf in the living room, where the cat has now jumped up and sits right beside her.

<div class="line_cn" title="欧维穿上那件蓝色冬季外套，踏上木屐，让猫先从门缝里钻了出去。他看看门厅墙壁上索雅的照片，她冲他笑。死或许也没那么重要，再等个把小时无妨，欧维心想，然后跟上猫咪。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“欧维？”他开口道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Rune gives him a concentrated stare for a second or two, as if his brain is fighting desperately to produce a memory.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="鲁尼专心致志地看了他几秒钟，就像头脑正与什么外部干扰奋力斗争以便强挤出一片记忆来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你家有波形铁皮吗？”欧维也不寒暄，开门见山地问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Rune looks at him, or rather he looks straight through him. His eyes have the gleam of a newly waxed car hood. He's emaciated and hunchbacked; his beard is gray, bordering on white. This used to be a solid bloke commanding a bit of respect, but now his clothes hang on his body in rags. He's grown old: very, very old, Ove realizes, and it hits him with a force he hadn't quite counted on. Rune's gaze flickers for a moment. Then his mouth starts twitching.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="鲁尼看着他，就像能直直地看穿他似的，一双闪着光芒的眼睛，像新打了蜡的引擎盖。他瘦削而佝偻，胡子灰得几乎发白。他曾经是个魁梧且有几分威严的家伙，如今已是衣衫褴褛。他老了，非常非常老，这一点对欧维的打击难以估量。鲁尼的视线游移了片刻，嘴角突然抽动了一下。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ove stands there with his hands in his pockets. The cat beside him looks as if it would do the same, if it had pockets. Or hands. Anita is small and colorless in her gray trousers, gray knitted cardigan, gray hair, and gray skin. But Ove notices that her face is slightly red-eyed and swollen. Quickly she wipes her eyes and blinks away the pain. As women of that generation do. As if they stood in the doorway every morning, determinedly driving sorrow out of the house with a broom. Tenderly she takes Rune by the shoulders and leads him to his wheelchair by the window in the living room.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="安妮塔点头表示理解，就像在认可一个没有铁皮屋顶的人毫不费劲就把波形铁皮用完了这件事一点都不奇怪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A minute later, Ove turns up triumphantly in the doorway, dragging a gigantic piece of corrugated iron, as big as a living room rug. Anita honestly has no idea how such a large piece of metal has even fitted in there without her knowing about it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一分钟之后，欧维得意地拽着一块巨大的波形铁皮出现在门廊外，那铁皮跟客厅用的地毯差不多大。安妮塔根本搞不明白，这么大一块铁皮是怎么在她不知情的情况下被塞进储藏室的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Told you," Ove says with a nod, giving her back the key.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ove turns to the window. Rune looks back. And just as Anita turns around to go back into the house, Rune grins again, and lifts his hand in a brief wave. As if right there, just for a second, he knew exactly who Ove was and what he was doing there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维朝窗口张望，鲁尼回望过来。正当安妮塔转身准备进屋的时候，鲁尼又笑了，举起手轻轻挥了挥。就像此时此刻，就这一秒钟，他完全知道欧维是谁，他来干什么。欧维捣弄出一种在瓷砖地板上拖钢琴的时候会发出的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"They say I'm not capable of taking care of him. With his illness and everything. They say he has to go into a home," she says.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他们说，以他的病和身体状况，我照顾不了，必须把他送去疗养院。”她说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He'll die if I put him in a home, Ove. You know that…" she whispers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“要是我把他留在养老院里，他会死，欧维，你知道的。”她喃喃道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ove nods and looks at the remains of a cigarette butt, frozen into the crack between two paving stones. Out of the corner of his eye he notices how Anita is sort of leaning slightly to one side. Sonja explained about a year ago that it was the hip replacement operation, he remembers. Her hands shake as well, these days. "The first stage of multiple sclerosis," Sonja had also explained. And a few years ago Rune got Alzheimer's as well.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维点点头，瞪着冻在两块地砖之间的一小截烟蒂。眼角的余光中，他看到安妮塔好像往一侧轻轻倚靠着。索雅几年前解释过，这是骨盆手术的结果，他记得。现在她的手也开始颤抖起来。“多发性硬化症第一阶段”，索雅解释过。几年之后，鲁尼也得上了老年痴呆症。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Your lad can come and give you a hand, then," he mumbles in a low voice.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ove doesn't answer. Anita says "America" as if it were the kingdom of heaven where her egotistical son has moved. Not once has Ove seen that brat here on the street since Rune sickened. Grown man now, but no time for his parents.</div>

<div class="line_en">She goes back into the house. Ove stays where he is with the sheet of corrugated iron in his hand and the cat at his side. He mutters something to himself just before the door is closed. Anita turns around in surprise, peers out of the crack, and looks at him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她回到屋里。欧维手里拿着铁皮和猫一起留在原地，门合上的时候，他自言自语般地说了句什么。安妮塔惊讶地转过身，从门缝中再次探出头来看着他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ove twists without meeting her eyes. Then he turns and starts to leave, while his words slip out of him involuntarily.</div>

<div class="line_en">Anita's furrowed face pulls itself into a surprised smile. She takes half a step out the door, as if she wants to say something more. Maybe something about Sonja, how deeply she misses her best friend. How she misses what they had, all four of them, when they first moved onto this street almost forty years ago. How she even misses the way Rune and Ove used to argue. But Ove has already disappeared around the corner.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="安妮塔布满皱纹的脸露出惊讶的笑容来。她朝门外迈出半步，看上去就像还有话要说。或许是关于索雅，比如她对她最好的朋友有多么深沉的思念。她多怀念差不多将近四十年以前他们刚刚搬来这个小区时四个人在一起的时光，她甚至怀念鲁尼和欧维之间的争执，但欧维已经在拐角处消失了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="猫歪着脑袋打量着铁皮。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He stands next to the cat, evaluating his creation for a long time. A perfect dog trap, hidden under snow, bursting with electricity, ready to bite. It seems a wholly proportionate revenge. The next time Blond Weed passes by with that bloody mutt of hers and the latter gets the idea of peeing on Ove's paving, it'll do so onto an electrified, conductive metal plate. And then let's see how amusing they find it, Ove thinks to himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他站在猫身边，仔细检验了自己的杰作好一会儿。一个完美的陷阱，隐藏在冰雪下，通电待命。看上去是非常合情理的报复。下次那个霉女再牵着狗崽子来欧维这边地上撒尿，就会尿在这块通了电的铁皮上。到时候，看看他们到底会觉得这多有趣，欧维想。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Back in his toolshed, Ove fetches the spare battery for the Saab and two large metal clips. He lays out the sheet of corrugated iron across the paving stones between the shed and the house and carefully covers it with snow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维和猫回到储藏室，取出萨博的备用电池和两把大金属钳。然后他把那片大铁皮铺在储藏室和房子之间的地上，仔细地在上面盖上一层雪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The cat looks at him for a long time. As if to say: "You're not serious, are you?" Eventually Ove sticks his hands in his pockets and shakes his head.</div>

<div class="line_en">And then he packs up the battery and clamps and corrugated iron and puts everything in the garage. Not because he doesn't think those morons deserve a proper electric shock.

<div class="line_cn" title="接着他收起电池、钳子和铁皮，把它们塞进车库。他并不觉得霉女和狗崽子不该遭到电击的报应，而是完全活该。但他意识到，很久以前，有人提醒过他好心干坏事和存心干坏事的区别。">查看中文翻译</div>
