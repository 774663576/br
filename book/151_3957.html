<div class="line_en">Mom homeschools me. She used to be a children's-book illustrator. She draws really great fairies and mermaids. Her boy stuff isn't so hot, though. She once tried to draw me a Darth Vader, but it ended up looking like some weird mushroom-shaped robot. I haven't seen her draw anything in a long time. I think she's too busy taking care of me and Via.</div>

<div class="line_en">Next week I start fifth grade. Since I've never been to a real school before, I am pretty much totally and completely petrified. People think I haven't gone to school because of the way I look, but it's not that. It's because of all the surgeries I've had. Twenty-seven since I was born. The bigger ones happened before I was even four years old, so I don't remember those. But I've had two or three surgeries every year since then (some big, some small), and because I'm little for my age, and I have some other medical mysteries that doctors never really figured out, I used to get sick a lot. That's why my parents decided it was better if I didn't go to school. I'm much stronger now, though. The last surgery I had was eight months ago, and I probably won't have to have any more for another couple of years.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="下周我开始上五年级。因为从来没有真正上过学，所以我整个人提心吊胆。大家以为我不上学是因为我的长相，其实并非如此。真实原因是我所做的所有手术，从出生起迄今有二十七次了。大手术都是在四岁以前做的，所以我都记不得了。但从那以后我每年都要动两三次手术（或大，或小），因为我长得比实际年龄小，身上还带着一些医生永远不得其解的医学奥秘，所以我总是在生病。这也是父母决定我最好不上学的原因。不过，我现在强壮多了。我最后一次动手术是在八个月前，而且也许未来几年内都不需要再动手术了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I can't say I always wanted to go to school because that wouldn't be exactly true. What I wanted was to go to school, but only if I could be like every other kid going to school. Have lots of friends and hang out after school and stuff like that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我不能说自己一直都希望上学，因为事实不全是这样。我想上学，前提是我能够跟别的孩子一样，有许许多多的朋友，放学后一起闲逛，诸如此类。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I have a few really good friends now. Christopher is my best friend, followed by Zachary and Alex. We've known each other since we were babies. And since they've always known me the way I am, they're used to me. When we were little, we used to have playdates all the time, but then Christopher moved to Bridgeport in Connecticut. That's more than an hour away from where I live in North River Heights, which is at the top tip of Manhattan. And Zachary and Alex started going to school. It's funny: even though Christopher's the one who moved far away, I still see him more than I see Zachary and Alex. They have all these new friends now. If we bump into each other on the street, they're still nice to me, though. They always say hello.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我有几个很不错的朋友。克里斯托弗是最铁的，然后是扎克利和阿历克斯。我们是发小。因此他们知道这就是我真实的样子，对我已经习以为常。小的时候，我们常常一起聚会，但后来克里斯托弗搬到康涅狄格州的布里奇波特。那地方离我住的位于曼哈顿岛北端的北河高地有一小时路程。扎克利和阿历克斯也上学去了。他们现在也有了新朋友。不过，如果我们在街上碰见，他们依然对我不错。他们总是和我打招呼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I have other friends, too, but not as good as Christopher and Zack and Alex were. For instance, Zack and Alex always invited me to their birthday parties when we were little, but Joel and Eamonn and Gabe never did. Emma invited me once, but I haven't seen her in a long time. And, of course, I always go to Christopher's birthday. Maybe I'm making too big a deal about birthday parties.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我也有别的朋友，但都不如跟克里斯托弗、扎克利和阿历克斯那么铁。比如，小时候扎克利和阿历克斯总是会邀请我去参加他们的生日派对，但是乔尔、伊蒙和加布从来没有。艾玛邀请过我一次，但我已经很久没见她了。当然，我还一直去参加克里斯托弗的生日聚会。也许我把生日派对看得太重了。">查看中文翻译</div>
