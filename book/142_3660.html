<div class="line_en">Now at supper with his wife in their solidly furnished apartment, gilt statues of the Virgin Mary with their red-glassed candles flickering on the sideboard, Bonasera lit a Camel cigarette and took a relaxing glass of American whiskey. His wife brought steaming plates of soup to the table. The two of them were alone now; he had sent his daughter to live in Boston with her mother's sister, where she could forget her terrible experience and her injuries at the hands of the two ruffians Don Corleone had punished.</div>

<div class="line_en">He always resented the jokes made about his profession, the macabre technical details which were so unimportant.

<div class="line_en">Amerigo Bonasera nodded. His wife respected his work but did not understand it. She did not understand that the technical part of his profession was the least important. She thought, like most other people, that he was paid for his skill in making the dead look so lifelike in their coffins. And indeed his skill in this was legendary. But even more important, even more necessary was his physical presence at the wake. When the bereaved family came at night to receive their blood relatives and their friends beside the coffin of their loved one, they needed Amerigo Bonasera with them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="亚美利哥·勃纳瑟拉点了点头。老婆尊重他的工作，但却不理解他的工作。他的职业的技术其实是最不足挂齿的，这一点她是不理解的。像大多数人一样，她也认为他赚钱凭的就是他能够使死者在棺材里看上去像活人一样。说实在的，他在这方面的技术的确是名不虚传的。但是他职业中更重要的，甚至更必要的一面，乃是他守灵时全神贯注的表情。当死者的家属夜间在死者的棺材旁边接待他们的亲戚朋友时，他们很需要亚美利哥·勃纳瑟拉陪着他们。原因就是他能很认真地陪伴死人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For he was a strict chaperone to death. His face always grave, yet strong and comforting, his voice unwavering, yet muted to a low register, he commanded the mourning ritual. He could quiet grief that was too unseemly, he could rebuke unruly children whose parents had not the heart to chastise. Never cloying in the tender of his condolences, yet never was he offhand. Once a family used Amerigo Bonasera to speed a loved one on, they came back to him again and again. And he never, never, deserted one of his clients on that terrible last night above ground.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的面容一直很庄重、很坚强、很能安慰人。他的声音很平稳，很低沉。他的情绪控制着整个追悼会的气氛。他能够把过分的悲伤情绪缓和下来。当父母没有心思教训小孩子的时候，他能够把不守规矩的小孩子加以约束。他吊唁时绝不悲哀过度，但是也绝不表现得吊儿郎当。一旦一个家庭使用过亚美利哥·勃纳瑟拉的殡仪馆，下次他们家死了人，一定还要来找他。而他呢，绝不会丢下那个在人间过最后一夜的“顾客”不管。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Usually he allowed himself a little nap after supper. Then he washed and shaved afresh, talcum powder generously used to shroud the heavy black beard. A mouthwash always. He respectfully changed into fresh linen, white gleaming shirt, the black tie, a freshly pressed dark suit, dull black shoes and black socks. And yet the effect was comforting instead of somber. He also kept his hair dyed black, an unheard-of frivolity in an Italian male of his generation; but not out of vanity. Simply because his hair had turned a lively pepper and salt, a color which struck him as unseemly for his profession.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他通常在晚饭后要小睡一会儿，醒来，就洗一洗，刮一刮脸，然后往脸上擦大量的爽身粉，想把他那刚刮的但仍然乌黑的胡子盖住。他每次都要用漱口剂漱漱口，慢条斯理地换上新衣服：白得发亮的衬衫、黑领带、刚烫过的黑服装、暗黑色的鞋袜。但是，总的效果是使人感到安慰，而不是使人感到忧郁。另外，他经常把自己的头发染得黑黑的，这种爱俏的轻浮习惯，在他那一代意大利男子中是绝无仅有的。但他染头发可不是出于虚荣。原因很简单，他的头发黑白相问而呈现灰色，这种颜色显得活泼，但同他的职业有点不相称。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After he finished his soup, his wife placed a small steak before him with a few forkfuls of green spinach oozing yellow oil. He was a light eater. When he finished this he drank a cup of coffee and smoked another Camel cigarette. Over his coffee he thought about his poor daughter. She would never be the same. Her outward beauty had been restored but there was the look of a frightened animal in her eyes that had made him unable to bear the sight of her. And so they had sent her to live in Boston for a time. Time would heal her wounds. Pain and terror was not so final as death, as he well knew. His work made him an optimist.</div>

His wife never answered it when he was home, so he got up and drained his cup and stubbed out his cigarette.

<div class="line_en">Amerigo Bonasera felt the coffee churning sourly in his stomach, felt himself going a little sick. It was more than a year since he had put himself in the debt of the Don to avenge his daughter's honor and in that time the knowledge that he must pay that debt had receded. He had been so grateful seeing the bloody faces of those two ruffians that he would have done anything for the Don. But time erodes gratitude more quickly than it does beauty. Now Bonasera felt the sickness of a man faced with disaster. His voice faltered as he answered, "Yes, I understand. I'm listening."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="黑根的声音变得比较温和了，但是仍有点阴阳怪气。“谢谢你，”他说。“老头子从来没有怀疑过你，问题是我对你有点不放心。今天晚上你就满足他的要求吧，以后你有什么困难随时找我好了。只要你满足他的要求，你就会赢得我的友谊。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was surprised at the coldness in Hagen's voice. The Consigliere had always been a courteous man, though not Italian, but now he was being rudely brusque. "You owe the Don a service," Hagen said. "He has no doubt that you will repay him. That you will be happy to have this opportunity. In one hour, not before, perhaps later, he will be at your funeral parlor to ask for your help. Be there to greet him. Don't have any people who work for you there. Send them home.

<div class="line_en">This building stood by itself on a large lot with a white picket fence running all around it. There was a narrow roadway leading from the street to the rear, just wide enough for ambulances and hearses. Bonasera unlocked the gate and left it open. Then he walked to the rear of the building and entered it through the wide door there. As he did so he could see mourners already entering the front door of the funeral parlor to pay their respects to the current corpse.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="殡仪馆的房子孤零零地耸立在一片很大的空地上，周围有白色栅栏。从大街到这座房子后面，有一条很狭窄的车道。只能通过救护车和灵车。勃纳瑟拉把大门上的锁打开，把门开得大大的，然后，他走到房子后面，从宽大的后门进了屋子。当他向房子后面走去的时候，他看到许多吊唁的人正在从前门进入殡仪馆，向亲友的遗体告别。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Many years ago when Bonasgra had bought this building from an undertaker planning to retire, there had been a stoop of about ten steps that mourners had to mount before entering the funeral parlor. This had posed a problem. Old and crippled mourners determined to pay their respects had found the steps almost impossible to mount, so the former undertaker had used the freight elevator for these people, a small metal platform, that rose out of the ground beside the building. The elevator was for coffins and bodies. It would descend underground, then rise into the funeral parlor itself, so that a crippled mourner would find himself rising through the floor beside the coffin as other mourners moved their black chairs aside to let the elevator rise throngh the trapdoor. Then when the crippled or aged mourner had finished paying his respects, the elevator would again come up through the polished floor to take him down and out again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="许多年以前，勃纳瑟拉从一个退休的殡仪馆老板那里购买了这座房子，那时门前的一段台阶有十来个阶梯，吊唁的人要爬十来个梯级才能进入殡仪馆，这就产生了一个问题：吊唁者中的老弱病残者有心同死者见最后一面，但却爬不上去。原来的老板就给这类吊唁者使用行李吊车。所谓行李吊车，就是一个小小的铁板平台，设在房子旁边，同地面一样高，能够升起来。这个行李吊车本来是专门运送棺材和尸体的：先是降到地下，然后上升，就到吊唁厅里面了。这样，病残的吊唁者就会发现自己从棺材旁边的地板下面钻了上来。当这些吊唁者向死者告别之后，吊车又接他们下去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Amerigo Bonasera had found this solution to the problem upseernly and penny-pinching.

<div class="line_cn" title="亚美利哥·勃纳瑟拉认为这不像话，像是舍不得花钱。因此。他把房子前院整修了一下，台阶去掉了，改修成坡度很小的人行道。但吊车仍然保留着，专门用于运送棺材和尸体。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the rear of the building, cut off from the funeral parlor and reception rooms by a massive soundproof door, was the business office, the embalming room, a storeroom for coffins, and a carefully locked closet holding chemicals and the awful tools of his trade. Bonasera went to the office, sat at his desk and lit up a Camel,, one of the few times he had ever smoked in this building. Then he waited for Don Corleone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="房子后半部同前半部的吊唁厅与接待室是隔开的，中间有个很大的门，是隔音的；业务办公室、给尸体涂防腐剂的屋子、棺材仓库、锁得很牢的贮藏化学药品和可怕的整容器械的密室，都在后半部。勃纳瑟拉走进办公室，坐在办公桌旁，点着一支香烟。他难得在这栋房子里抽一次香烟。他在等候考利昂老头子的到来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He waited with a feeling of the utmost despair. For, he had no doubt as to what services he would be called upon to perform. For the last year the Corleone Family had waged war against the five great Mafia Families of New York and the carnage had filled the newspapers. Many men on both sides had been killed. Now the Corleone Family had killed somebody so important that they wished to hide his body, make it disappear, and what better way than to have it officially buried by a registered undertaker? And Amerigo Bonasera had no illusions about the act he was to commit. He would be an accessory to murder. If it came out, he would spend years in jail. His daughter and wife would be disgraced, his good name, the respected name of Amerigo Bonasera, dragged through the bloody, mud of the Mafia war.</div>

When the other Mafia Families found out that he had aided the Corleones they would treat him as an enemy. They would murder him. And now he cursed the day he had gone to the Godfather and begged for his vengeance. He cursed the day his wife and the wife of Don Corleone had become friends. He cursed his daughter and America and his own success. And then his optimism returned. It could all go well. Don Corleone was a clever man. Certainly everything had been arranged to keep the secret. He had only to keep his nerve. For of course the one thing more fatal than any other was to earn the Don's displeasure.</div>
