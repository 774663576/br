<div class="line_en">Thus, the boys had gone out to work, after school hours, and in the vacations, since they were very young. Unhappily, neither Eliza nor Gant were at any pains to examine the kind of work their children did, contenting themselves vaguely with the comfortable assurance that all work which earned money was honest, commendable, and formative of character.</div>

<div class="line_en">But this freedom, this isolation in print, this dreaming and unlimited time of fantasy, was not to last unbroken. Both Gant and Eliza were fluent apologists for economic independence: all the boys had been sent out to earn money at a very early age.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Pshaw!" said Eliza. "It won't do them a bit of harm. If they don't learn now, they won't do a stroke of work later on. Besides, they can earn their own pocket money." This, undoubtedly, was a consideration of the greatest importance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“一点没错！”伊丽莎说，“这样做对他们一点坏处都没有。他们要是现在不学着干点儿活，将来可就什么都干不了了。还有，他们也能给自己挣点零花钱嘛。”毫无疑问，这一条才是最重要的方面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">By this time Ben, sullen, silent, alone, had withdrawn more closely than ever into his heart: in the brawling house he came and went, and was remembered, like a phantom. Each morning at three o'clock, when his fragile unfurnished body should have been soaked in sleep, he got up under the morning stars, departed silently from the sleeping house, and went down to the roaring morning presses and the inksmell that he loved, to begin the delivery of his route. Almost without consideration by Gant and Eliza he slipped quietly away from school after the eighth grade, took on extra duties at the paper's office and lived, in sufficient bitter pride, upon his earnings. He slept at home, ate perhaps one meal a day there, loping home gauntly at night, with his father's stride, thin long shoulders, bent prematurely by the weight of the heavy paper bag, pathetically, hungrily Gantian.</div>

<div class="line_en">He bore encysted in him the evidence of their tragic fault: he walked alone in the darkness, death and the dark angels hovered, and no one saw him. At three-thirty in the morning, with his loaded bag beside him, he sat with other route boys in a lunch room, with a cup of coffee in one hand and a cigarette in the other, laughing softly, almost noiselessly, with his flickering exquisitely sensitive mouth, his scowling gray eyes.</div>

<div class="line_en">At home he spent hours quietly absorbed in his life with Eugene, playing with him, cuffing him with his white hard hands from time to time, establishing with him a secret communication to which the life of the family had neither access nor understanding. From his small wages he gave the boy sums of spending-money, bought him expensive presents on his birthdays, at Christmas, or some special occasion, inwardly moved and pleased when he saw how like Mæcenas he seemed to Eugene, how deep and inexhaustible to the younger boy were his meagre resources. What he earned, all the history of his life away from home, he kept in jealous secrecy.</div>

<div class="line_en">Perhaps, as pigeon-toed, well creased, brushed, white-collared, Ben loped through the streets, or prowled softly and restlessly about the house, his dark angel wept, but no one else saw, and no one knew. He was a stranger, and as he sought through the house, he was always aprowl to find some entrance into life, some secret undiscovered door -- a stone, a leaf -- that might admit him into light and fellowship. His passion for home was fundamental, in that jangled and clamorous household his sullen and contained quiet was like some soothing opiate on their nerves: with quiet authority, white-handed skill, he sought about repairing old scars, joining with delicate carpentry old broken things, prying quietly about a short-circuited wire, a defective socket.</div>

He had a deep scowling affection for them all: he never forgot their birthdays, he always placed where they might find it, some gift, small, inexpensive, selected with the most discriminating taste. When, with their fervent over-emphasis, they went through long ecstasies of admiration, embroidering their thanks with florid decorations, he would jerk his head sideways to some imaginary listener, laughing softly and irritably, as he said:</div>

Tarkinton told me the other day that Rafe has given him five dollars a week for his food ever since he was sixteen. Do you think I could look for such treatment from one of mine? Do you? Not until Hell freezes over -- and not then!" And he would refer to the hardships of his own youth, cast out, so he said, to earn his living, at an age which varied, according to his temper, at from six to eleven years, contrasting his poverty to the luxury in which his own children wallowed.</div>

<div class="line_en">Eugene was initiated to the ethics of success. It was not enough that a man work, though work was fundamental; it was even more important that he make money -- a great deal if he was to be a great success -- but at least enough to "support himself." This was for both Gant and Eliza the base of worth. Of so and so, they might say:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尤金早就领悟了成功的真谛。虽然说工作是基本要素，但是一个人光有工作还不够；一个人还得赚到钱才行——越要成功就越要赚更多的钱——至少要能“养活自己”。对于这一点，甘特和伊丽莎两人都深信不疑。一提起某某人，他们可能会说：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the fresh sweet mornings of Spring now, Eugene was howled out of bed at six-thirty by his father, descended to the cool garden, and there, assisted by Gant, filled small strawberry baskets with great crinkled lettuces, radishes, plums, and green apples -- somewhat later, with cherries. With these packed in a great hamper, he would peddle his wares through the neighborhood, selling them easily and delightfully, in a world of fragrant morning cookery, at five or ten cents a basket. He would return home gleefully with empty hamper in time for breakfast: he liked the work, the smell of gardens, of fresh wet vegetables; he loved the romantic structure of the earth which filled his pocket with chinking coins.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这个阶段，正是春意盎然、空气清新的时候，尤金六点半就被父亲从床上叫了起来。他来到下面阴凉的菜园里，手提着篮子，协助父亲采摘果菜。一个个大篮子里装满了皱皮的生菜、小萝卜、李子、青苹果，再过几天还会有樱桃。他把这果菜装进一个大篓子里，然后提着来到左邻右舍去推销，每篮子卖5至10分钱。这时候正是早饭飘香的时候，他卖得轻松、愉快，很快一篓子东西就卖得净光。然后他会高高兴兴地拎着空篓子回家吃早饭。他很喜欢干这项活儿，也喜欢菜园子里的味道和蔬菜湿而新鲜的味道；他喜欢这块神奇的土地，因为它使他的口袋里装满了叮当作响的硬币。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He was permitted to keep the money of his sales, although Eliza was annoyingly insistent that he should not squander it, but open a bank account with it with which, one day, he might establish himself in business, or buy a good piece of property. And she bought him a little bank, into which his reluctant fingers dropped a portion of his earnings, and from which he got a certain dreary satisfaction from time to time by shaking it close to his ear and dwelling hungrily on all the purchasable delight that was locked away from him in the small heavy bullion-clinking vault. There was a key, but Eliza kept it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他可以自己保留赚来的钱，但是伊丽莎却喋喋不休地叮嘱他不要乱花钱，最好拿到银行里开个户头，等将来做生意或者购地置业的时候能派上用场。她还给儿子买了一个小小的储蓄罐。尤金手里捏着赚来的小分币，很不情愿地丢了进去。只要有空他就会拿起小罐子，放到耳边轻轻地摇一摇，幻想着打开这个装着巨额财富的罐子以后，自己能够尽情地享受金钱换来的快乐。但是罐子的钥匙一直由伊丽莎保管着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But, as the months passed, and the sturdy child's body of his infancy lengthened rapidly to some interior chemical expansion, and he became fragile, thin, pallid, but remarkably tall for his age, Eliza began to say: "That boy's big enough to do a little work."</div>

He lived absolutely in event: there was in him no secret place, nothing withheld and guarded -- he had an instinctive horror of all loneliness.</div>

<div class="line_en">He wanted above all else to be esteemed and liked by the world, and the need for the affection and esteem of his family was desperately essential. The fulsome praise, the heartiness of hand and tongue, the liberal display of sentiment were as the breath of life to him: he was overwhelmingly insistent in the payment of drinks at the fountain, the bringer-home of packed ice-cream for Eliza, and of cigars to Gant and, as Gant gave publication to his generosity, the boy's need for it increased -- he built up an image of himself as the Good Fellow, witty, unselfish, laughed at but liked by all -- as Big-Hearted Unselfish Luke. And this was the opinion people had of him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="首先，他渴望得到全世界的尊重和喜爱，而家庭的温暖和尊重是他内心最基本的需要。那些令人生厌的称赞、对他表示喜欢和友好的言行，都像生命里的呼吸一天都不能缺少。在冷饮店里，他常会态度坚决地争着付款，回家的时候总会给伊丽莎买来冰淇淋，给甘特带去香烟。所以甘特逢人就夸这个慷慨大方的儿子，这样一来，他就越发想听到别人的表扬了——他就这样为自己树立了热诚、亲切、诙谐、无私的形象。有些人可能会笑话他，但是人人都很喜欢他。人们都把他称作“善良、无私的卢克”。人们对他的看法就是这样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Many times in the years that followed, when Eugene's pockets were empty, Luke thrust a coin roughly and impatiently in them, but, hard as the younger boy's need might be, there was always an awkward scene -- painful, embarrassed protestations, a distressful confusion because Eugene, having accurately and intuitively gauged his brother's hunger for gratitude and esteem, felt sharply that he was yielding up his independence to a bludgeoning desire.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在那几年里，很多次当尤金的口袋里缺钱的时候，卢克总会不由分说地硬塞给他一枚硬币。但即使他真的需要钱，每次拿到钱的时候总觉得很不自在——他推推让让地不肯接受，弄得双方都很难为情。因为尤金凭直觉感觉到哥哥的慷慨纯粹是要别人的感谢和尊重，所以他强烈地感受到这种胁迫的愿望使他丧失了自我的独立性。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Thus, before he was ten, Eugene's brooding spirit was nettled in the complexity of truth and seeming. He could find no words, no answers to the puzzles that baffled and maddened him: he found himself loathing that which bore the stamp of virtue, sick with weariness and horror at what was considered noble. He was hurled, at eight years, against the torturing paradox of the ungenerous-generous, the selfish-unselfish, the noble-base, and unable to fathom or define those deep springs of desire in the human spirit that seek public gratification by virtuous pretension, he was made wretched by the conviction of his own sinfulness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就这样，在还不到十岁的时候，尤金的精神便处在事实与表面不相一致的复杂状态中。对那些令人困惑的疑团，他表达不了也无法解释。他发现自己对普遍认可的德行十分厌恶，对那些人们十分推崇的善行既害怕又恶心。8岁的时候，他就不得不面对那些令他伤透脑筋的矛盾：吝啬与慷慨、自私与无私、高尚与卑鄙。他无法理解，也无法解释人类精神中那些虚伪地取悦公众心理的根源究竟是什么。他深信自己难免也会犯上这种罪过，于是内心会十分痛苦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He had never felt the slightest shame at Ben's bounty: his enormously sensitized perception had told him long since that he might get the curse of annoyance, the cuff of anger, from his brother, but that past indulgences would not be brandished over him, and that even the thought of having bestowed gifts would give Ben inward shame. In this, he was like Ben: the thought of a gift he made, with its self-congratulatory implications, made him writhe.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是面对本恩的慷慨，他却从没有感到过不好意思。他非常敏锐地感觉到，这个哥哥不耐烦的时候可能会骂他，发火的时候可能会揍他，但是他绝不会在他面前提起曾经给过他什么东西，即使在内心里想一想曾给过他什么东西都会令本恩羞愧难当。在这一点上，尤金跟本恩很相似：一想起给别人送过的礼物，不免会产生自鸣得意的心理，这总令他心里很不平静。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was in him a savage honesty, which exercised an uncontrollable domination over him when his heart or head were deeply involved. Thus, at the funeral of some remote kinsman, or of some acquaintance of the family, for whom he had never acquired any considerable affection, he would grow bitterly shamefast if, while listening to the solemn drone of the minister, or the sorrowful chanting of the singers, he felt his face had assumed an expression of unfelt and counterfeited grief: as a consequence he would shift about matter-of-factly, cross his legs, gaze indifferently at the ceiling, or look out of the window with a smile, until he was conscious his conduct had attracted the attention of people, and that they were looking on him with disfavor.

The generous one, who had never in all his life had the power to fasten his mind upon the pages of a book, or the logic of number, for an hour together, resented, as he see-sawed comically from one leg to another, stammering quaintly, whistling for the word that stuck in his throat, the brooding abstraction of the youngest.</div>

And the older boy, too, smarting from his own dismal performances at school, convinced himself that the deep inward turning of the spirit, the brooding retreat into the secret place, which he recognized in the mysterious hypnotic power of language over Eugene, was not only a species of indolence, for the only work he recognized was that which strained at weight or sweated in the facile waggery of the tongue, but that it was moreover the indulgence of a "selfish" family-forgetting spirit.

There was, in fact, no excess of suggestion that Gant did not use upon his youngest son -- he had felt, long since, the vibration to every tremor of feeling of the million-noted little instrument, and it pleased him to see the child wince, gulp, tortured with remorse.

When Eugene was six, Gant had promised him carelessly a pony for Christmas, without any intention of fulfilling his promise. As Christmas neared he had begun to speak touchingly of "Little Jimmy," of the countless advantages of Eugene's lot and, after a mighty struggle, the boy had renounced the pony, in a scrawled message to Elfland, in favor of the cripple. Eugene never forgot: even when he had reached manhood the deception of "Little Jimmy" returned to him, without rancor, without ugliness, only with pain for all the blind waste, the stupid perjury, the thoughtless dishonor, the crippling dull deceit.</div>

They were two young men bored with the hills, the town, the deadly regime of their treatment, and it occurred to him years later that they had concocted the business, days ahead, in their dull lives, living for the excitement and terror they would arouse in him. His response was more violent than they had bargained for: he went mad with fear, screamed, and fought insanely. They were weak as cats, he squirmed out of their grasp and off the bed cuffing and clawing tigerishly, striking and kicking them with blind and mounting rage.

<div class="line_en">Eugene's face was of no use to him as a mask: it was a dark pool in which every pebble of thought and feeling left its circle -- his shame, his distaste for his employment was obvious, although he tried to conceal it: he was accused of false pride, told that he was "afraid of a little honest work," and reminded of the rich benefits he had received from his big-hearted parents.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尤金的脸皮很薄，什么也挂不住，就像一个黑水池，任何一点想法和感受都会在上面泛起一圈圈的涟漪——他对这份差事的厌恶和羞愧一览无遗地体现在脸上。他虽然老想掩饰这一点，但是大家都说这是虚荣，说他不敢做“有意义的事”，并提醒他不要忘记父母给他的各种利益。">查看中文翻译</div>

Sometimes Ben, loping along the streets of the town, met him, hot, tired, dirty, wearing his loaded canvas bag, scowled fiercely at him, upbraided him for his unkempt appearance, and took him into a lunch-room for something to eat -- rich foaming milk, fat steaming kidney-beans, thick apple-pie.</div>

<div class="line_en">But the little mound of nickels and dimes and quarters chinked pleasantly in his pockets: leg-weary and exhausted he would stand before a gleaming fountain burying his hot face in an iced drink.

Listen to that, won't you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是本恩却毫不惧怕那些伪善的嘲讽，也不会被他们的胡说八道轻易糊弄过去。他能够非常清楚地看透他们的心理，他们一旦言语轻蔑，就会得到他嘲弄的冷笑；有时候他会对头顶之上，或者对身旁的同伴——那个神秘、愤世嫉俗的天使快速地点一点头，说：“噢，上帝啊！你听一听，你听到了吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Both Ben and Eugene were by nature aristocrats. Eugene had just begun to feel his social status -- or rather his lack of one; Ben had felt it for years. The feeling at bottom might have resolved itself simply into a desire for the companionship of elegant and lovely women: neither was able, nor would have dared, to confess this, and Eugene was unable to confess that he was susceptible to the social snub, or the pain of caste inferiority: any suggestion that the companionship of elegant people was preferable to the fellowship of a world of Tarkintons, and its blousy daughters, would have been hailed with heavy ridicule by the family, as another indication of false and undemocratic pride. He would have been called "Mr. Vanderbilt" or "the Prince of Wales."</div>
