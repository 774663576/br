<div class="line_en">They dined in Soho. Philip was tremulous with joy. It was not one of the more crowded of those cheap restaurants where the respectable and needy dine in the belief that it is bohemian and the assurance that it is economical. It was a humble establishment, kept by a good man from Rouen and his wife, that Philip had discovered by accident. He had been attracted by the Gallic look of the window, in which was generally an uncooked steak on one plate and on each side two dishes of raw vegetables. There was one seedy French waiter, who was attempting to learn English in a house where he never heard anything but French; and the customers were a few ladies of easy virtue, a menage or two, who had their own napkins reserved for them, and a few queer men who came in for hurried, scanty meals.</div>

<div class="line_en">Here Mildred and Philip were able to get a table to themselves. Philip sent the waiter for a bottle of Burgundy from the neighbouring tavern, and they had a potage aux herbes, a steak from the window aux pommes, and an omelette au kirsch. There was really an air of romance in the meal and in the place. Mildred, at first a little reserved in her appreciation --"I never quite trust these foreign places, you never know what there is in these messed up dishes"-- was insensibly moved by it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普和米尔德里德在这儿独占了一张桌子。菲利普叫侍者去隔壁的酒馆买瓶勃艮第。他点了蔬菜汤，要了块陈列在橱窗里的上好牛排配土豆，还有樱桃白兰地炒蛋。不论是这里的菜色还是气氛都颇有几分浪漫情调。米尔德里德最初还有些不适应——“我可不大信得过这种外国人开的小店，谁知道盘子里堆得乱七八糟的都是些什么东西”——可后来也被这种微妙的浪漫气氛所打动了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A tall fellow came in, with a mane of gray hair and a ragged thin beard. He wore a dilapidated cloak and a wide-awake hat. He nodded to Philip, who had met him there before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个高个子男人走了进来。灰色的头发粗硬油亮，稀稀拉拉的胡子乱糟糟地在脸上长成一片。他穿着一件破烂外套，戴一顶宽边软毡帽。这人朝菲利普点头示意，他们两个之前就在这儿见过。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"He is, one of the most dangerous in Europe. He's been in every prison on the Continent and has assassinated more persons than any gentleman unhung.

<div class="line_cn" title="“千真万确，他是欧洲数一数二的危险人物。这片土地上就没有他没蹲过的大牢，杀的人比所有上了绞刑架的衣冠禽兽都要多。他走南闯北，口袋里一直揣着颗炸弹，和他说话可要很小心，一句没说对就要恶狠狠地掏出炸弹往桌上一放。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They had finished their dinner and were drinking coffee. Philip, throwing economy to the winds, smoked a three-penny cigar.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你真的无法想象，能坐在对面这样看着你，我就已经幸福得要升天了。我太想见到你了。见不到你，我都害了相思病。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The greenish pallor of her skin intoxicated him, and her thin white lips had an extraordinary fascination. Her anaemia made her rather short of breath, and she held her mouth slightly open. it seemed to add somehow to the attractiveness of her face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她淡青色的肌肤让菲利普心神荡漾，毫无血色的薄唇对他来说也出奇地诱人。因为贫血的缘故，她总是喘不过气来，微张的双唇让美丽的脸蛋更添俏媚。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mildred smiled a little and faintly flushed. She was not then suffering from the dyspepsia which generally attacked her immediately after a meal. She felt more kindly disposed to Philip than ever before, and the unaccustomed tenderness in her eyes filled him with joy. He knew instinctively that it was madness to give himself into her hands; his only chance was to treat her casually and never allow her to see the untamed passions that seethed in his breast; she would only take advantage of his weakness; but he could not be prudent now: he told her all the agony he had endured during the separation from her; he told her of his struggles with himself, how he had tried to get over his passion, thought he had succeeded, and how he found out that it was as strong as ever. He knew that he had never really wanted to get over it. He loved her so much that he did not mind suffering. He bared his heart to her. He showed her proudly all his weakness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="米尔德里德轻轻一笑，几丝红晕飞上脸颊。今天没有像往常一样饭后觉得肠胃不适，看着菲利普也比过去更顺眼了些。她眼波里罕见的温柔让菲利普飘飘欲仙，尽管知道完全向她臣服无异于发疯；尽管知道自己应该与她若即若离，不让心中蠢蠢欲动的激情暴露；尽管知道她会狡猾地利用自己的软弱，但这一刻，他什么也顾不上。他向她倾诉见不到她的这些日子是多么难熬，他在心里和自己打了无数次架，想要把那种难以抑制的冲动生生压下去，可尽管他打赢了，胜利了，却只发现想见她的冲动更加强烈。其实自己从未打算放弃这股冲动，因为爱她已经爱到不怕疼痛，愿意把心掏出来，赤裸裸地让她检视，把所有弱点都昂首挺胸地呈现在她面前。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He thought rapidly that if she cared for him at all she would say she preferred to stay there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="只要米尔德里德能有那么一点点喜欢他，就一定会说想多待一会儿吧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Nothing would have pleased him more than to sit on in the cosy, shabby restaurant, but he knew that Mildred wanted entertainment. She was restless and, wherever she was, wanted after a while to go somewhere else. He dared not bore her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管对他而言，没有什么比坐在这家惬意、简陋的餐馆里更幸福的了，但他知道米尔德里德喜欢寻求刺激。她是个闲不下来的姑娘，在哪儿都不愿逗留很久。而他又不敢让她觉得无聊。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我说，去杂耍剧院看看戏怎么样？”他问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I was just thinking we ought to be going if we are going," she answered.</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip waited impatiently for the end of the performance. He had made up his mind exactly what to do, and when they got into the cab he passed his arm, as though almost by accident, round her waist. But he drew it back quickly with a little cry. He had pricked himself. She laughed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="好不容易熬到演出结束，菲利普早就想好了一会儿应该怎么干。一上马车，他就假装作不经意地伸手揽住米尔德里德的腰，可他不知被什么扎了一下，大叫一声又抽回手来。米尔德里德笑了起来：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There, that comes of putting your arm where it's got no business to be," she said. "I always know when men try and put their arm round my waist. That pin always catches them."</div>

<div class="line_en">They drove down St. James' Street into the Park, and Philip quickly kissed her. He was strangely afraid of her, and it required all his courage. She turned her lips to him without speaking. She neither seemed to mind nor to like it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="马车沿着圣詹姆士街驶向公园，菲利普鼓足勇气，飞快地亲她一下。他有些没来由的恐慌。她没有说话，只把嘴唇转向他，好像对这个吻既不在意，也不满意。">查看中文翻译</div>
