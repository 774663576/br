<div class="line_en">He pulled out his wand and moved forward between the serpentine columns. Every careful footstep echoed loudly off the shadowy walls. He kept his eyes narrowed, ready to clamp them shut at the smallest sign of movement. The hollow eye sockets of the stone snakes seemed to be following him. More than once, with a jolt of the stomach, he thought he saw one stir.</div>

<div class="line_en">He was standing at the end of a very long, dimly lit chamber. Towering stone pillars entwined with more carved serpents rose to support a ceiling lost in darkness, casting long, black shadows through the odd, greenish gloom that filled the place.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他也站在一间长长的、光线昏暗的房间的一侧。许多刻着盘绕纠缠的大蛇的石柱，高耸着支撑起消融在高处黑暗中的天花板，给弥漫着绿盈盈神秘氤氲的整个房间投下一道道长长的诡谲的黑影。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then, as he drew level with the last pair of pillars, a statue high as the Chamber itself loomed into view, standing against the back wall.当他走到与最后一对石柱平行时,眼前赫然出现了一座和房间本身一样高的雕像,紧贴在后面黑乎乎的墙壁上.</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry had to crane his neck to look up into the giant face above: It was ancient and monkeyish, with a long, thin beard that fell almost to the bottom of the wizard's sweeping stone robes, where two enormous gray feet stood on the smooth Chamber floor. And between the feet, facedown, lay a small, black-robed figure with flaming-red hair.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利必须高高地仰起脖子，才能看见上面那副巨大的面孔——那是一张老态龙钟的、猴子般的脸，一把稀稀拉拉的长胡须，几乎一直拖到石头刻成的巫师长袍的下摆上，两只灰乎乎的大脚板站在房间光滑的地板上。在那两只脚之间，脸朝下躺着一个穿黑色长袍的小身影，头发红得像火焰一般。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“日记，”里德尔说，“我的日记。好几个月来，小金妮一直在上面写她的心里话，向我诉说她令人心疼的烦恼和悲哀——她怎样被哥哥们取笑，怎样不得不穿着旧长袍、拿着旧书来上学，还有，她认为——”里德尔的眼睛狡猾地闪烁着，“——认为大名鼎鼎的、善良的、伟大的哈利波特永远也不会喜欢她…”">查看中文翻译</div>

There are rooster feathers all over my robes and I don't know how they got there. Dear Tom, I can't remember what I did on the night of Halloween, but a cat was attacked and I've got paint all down my front. Dear Tom, Percy keeps telling me I'm pale and I'm not myself.

What if you found out how to work it, and I repeated all her secrets to you? What if, even worse, I told you who'd been strangling roosters? So the foolish little brat waited until your dormitory was deserted and stole it back. But I knew what I must do. It was clear to me that you were on the trail of Slytherin's heir. From everything Ginny had told me about you, I knew you would go to any lengths to solve the mystery -- particularly if one of your best friends was attacked. And Ginny had told me the whole school was buzzing because you could speak Parseltongue…</div>
