<div class="line_en">He woke. Cold air blew on his face. He was lying on his back. Evening was coming and the sky above was growing dim. He turned and found that the dream was little worse than the waking. His wrists, legs, and ankles were tied with cords. Beside him Merry lay, white-faced, with a dirty rag bound across his brows. All about them sat or stood a great company of Orcs.</div>

<div class="line_en">Slowly in Pippin's aching head memory pieced itself together and became separated from dream-shadows. Of course: he and Merry had run off into the woods. What had come over them? Why had they dashed off like that, taking no notice of old Strider? They had run a long way shouting -- he could not remember how far or how long; and then suddenly they had crashed right into a group of Orcs: they were standing listening, and they did not appear to see Merry and Pippin until they were almost in their arms. Then they yelled and dozens of other goblins had sprung out of the trees. Merry and he had drawn their swords, but the Orcs did not wish to fight, and had tried only to lay hold of them, even when Merry had cut off several of their arms and hands. Good old Merry!</div>

<div class="line_en">He could not answer the questions. He felt cold and sick. "I wish Gandalf had never persuaded Elrond to let us come," he thought. "What good have I been? Just a nuisance: a passenger, a piece of luggage. And now I have been stolen and I am just a piece of luggage for the Orcs. I hope Strider or someone will come and claim us! But ought I to hope for it? Won't that throw out all the plans? I wish I could get free!"</div>

<div class="line_en">Then Boromir had come leaping through the trees. He had made them fight. He slew many of them and the rest fled. But they had not gone far on the way back when they were attacked again, by a hundred Orcs at least, some of them very large, and they shot a rain of arrows: always at Boromir. Boromir had blown his great horn till the woods rang, and at first the Orcs had been dismayed and had drawn back; but when no answer but the echoes came, they had attacked more fiercely than ever. Pippin did not remember much more. His last memory was of Boromir leaning against a tree, plucking out an arrow; then darkness fell suddenly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后波罗莫就冲了出来，他逼迫对方动手，杀死了许多敌人，其它的半兽人都逃了开来。三人刚跑没多远，又被至少一百名以上的半兽人攻击；他们的身形非常壮硕，不停地瞄准波罗莫射箭。波罗莫奋命吹号，让森林也为之震动；一开始半兽人因恐惧而退却了，但是，等到他们发现只有回音，而没有任何援军赶来时，他们发动了更猛烈的攻击。皮聘接下来什么也不记得了，他眼前最后的景象是波罗莫靠在树上，拔出一根箭，然后一切就陷入黑暗中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Terrified Pippin lay still, though the pain at his wrists and ankles was growing, and the stones beneath him were boring into his back. To take his mind off himself he listened intently to all that he could hear. There were many voices round about, and though orc-speech sounded at all times full of hate and anger, it seemed plain that something like a quarrel had begun, and was getting hotter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="恐惧的皮聘动也不敢动，虽然他的手腕和脚踝都越来越痛，背后的石头也十分扎人，但他还是不敢动弹；为了让自己分心，他让自己专心倾听所有的声音。四周有各式各样的声音，虽然半兽人的语言本来就充满了仇恨，但皮聘还是听得出来，他们似乎陷入了越来越激烈的争执中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"If I had my way, you'd wish you were dead now," said the other. "I'd make you squeak, you miserable rat." He stooped over Pippin, bringing his yellow fangs close to his face. He had a black knife with a long jagged blade in his hand. "Lie quiet, or I'll tickle you with this," he hissed. "Don't draw attention to yourself, or I may forget my orders. Curse the Isengarders! Uglúk u bagronk sha pushdug Saruman-glob búbhosh skai": he passed into a long angry speech in his own tongue that slowly died away into muttering and snarling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“如果照我的方法做，你会希望现在自己已经死了，”另一个半兽人说：“你这只臭老鼠，我会让你吱吱叫个不停。”他走到皮聘身边，露出黄色的獠牙看着他，同时从腰间掏出一把黑色的锯齿小刀。“安静躺着，不然我就要用这个替你搔痒了！”他带着嘶声说道：“不要吵到其它人，否则我会忘记上级是怎么吩咐我的。该死的艾辛格士兵！乌骨陆bagronkshapush-dug萨鲁曼—globbbhoshskai”他紧接着用自己的语言咒骂了好长一串，最后才停歇下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He struggled a little, quite uselessly. One of the Orcs sitting near laughed and said something to a companion in their abominable tongue. "Rest while you can, little fool!" he said then to Pippin, in the Common Speech, which he made almost as hideous as his own language. "Rest while you can! We'll find a use for your legs before long. You'll wish you had got none before we get home."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他徒劳无功地挣扎了片刻，一名坐在附近的半兽人哈哈大笑，用他们的语言和伙伴嘀嘀咕咕不知道在说什么。“趁有机会的时候赶快休息吧，小笨蛋！”他接着用通用语对皮聘说，他的口音几乎让这变得和那邪恶的语言一样恶心。“把握机会休息！等下有得你走哩！在我们到家之前，你会希望老妈根本没生下你这双腿。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Many loud yells in orc-speech answered him, and the ringing clash of weapons being drawn. Cautiously Pippin rolled over, hoping to see what would happen. His guards had gone to join in the fray. In the twilight he saw a large black Orc, probably Uglúk, standing facing Grishnákh, a short crook-legged creature, very broad and with long arms that hung almost to the ground. Round them were many smaller goblins. Pippin supposed that these were the ones from the North. They had drawn their knives and swords, but hesitated to attack Uglúk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="许多半兽人开始大吼回应对方的羞辱，许多人拔剑相向，一时间陷入了剑拔弩张的紧张局面。皮聘小心翼翼地翻过身，希望看清楚到底发生了什么事情。看守他的卫兵已经迫不及待加入这场争辩。在微光中他看见一名高大的黑色半兽人，八成是乌骨陆，他面对着葛力斯那克，一个肩膀宽阔、短腿，手几乎可以碰到地面的家伙。有许多身形矮小的半兽人包围着两人。皮聘猜测这些家伙应该是从北方来的半兽人，他们都已经拔出了武器，但不敢贸然攻击乌骨陆。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Uglúk shouted, and a number of other Orcs of nearly his own size ran up. Then suddenly, without warning, Uglúk sprang forwards, and with two swift strokes swept the heads off two of his opponents. Grishnákh stepped aside and vanished into the shadows. The others gave way, and one stepped backwards and fell over Merry's prostrate form with a curse. Yet that probably saved his life, for Uglúk's followers leaped over him and cut down another with their broad-bladed swords. It was the yellow-fanged guard. His body fell right on top of Pippin, still clutching its long saw-edged knife.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乌骨陆大喝一声，几名和他同样身材的半兽人很快跑了过来。突然间，在毫无预警的状况下，乌骨陆一跃向前，两刀就砍倒了两名对手。葛力斯那克往旁边一退，消失在阴影中，其它人纷纷往四下散开，有一人后退时还不小心被躺在地上的梅里给绊倒了；不过，这可能反而救了他一命，因为乌骨陆的手下这时正好从他身上跃过，砍倒了另外一个对手，刚好就是那个长着黄色獠牙的守卫，他的身体一软，倒在皮聘身上，手上还紧握着那把锯齿小刀。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Orcs were getting ready to march again, but some of the Northerners were still unwilling, and the Isengarders slew two more before the rest were cowed. There was much cursing and confusion. For the moment Pippin was unwatched. His legs were securely bound, but his arms were only tied about the wrists, and his hands were in front of him. He could move them both together, though the bonds were cruelly tight. He pushed the dead Orc to one side, then hardly daring to breathe, he drew the knot of the wrist-cord up and down against the blade of the knife. It was sharp and the dead hand held it fast. The cord was cut! Quickly Pippin took it in his fingers and knotted it again into a loose bracelet of two loops and slipped it over his hands. Then he lay very still.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="半兽人正准备再度上路，但有些北方来的半兽人依旧不肯妥协，艾辛格的士兵又再杀了两个人，他们才终于低头，整个部队陷入咒骂和混乱的状态中。此时，没有任何人看守皮聘，他的腿被绑得很紧，但手臂只有在手腕的地方受到束缚，而且还是被绑在身前的；不过，下手的人也绑得非常紧。他将半兽人的尸体推到一边去，大气也不敢喘一口，小心翼翼地将手腕的绳子在刀刃上摩擦。刀刃本身很锋利，而死者又把小刀握得很紧，最后，绳子终于被割断了！皮聘很快地握住断绳，将它松松绑成原来的样子，重新套在手上，然后就躺了回去。">查看中文翻译</div>

Then he saw that the sun was sinking, falling behind the Misty Mountains; shadows reached over the land. The soldiers of Mordor lifted their heads and also began to put on speed. The forest was dark and close. Already they had passed a few outlying trees. The land was beginning to slope upwards, ever more steeply; but the Orcs did not halt.

It did indeed become very dark again; for the moon passed westward into thick cloud, and Pippin could not see anything a few feet away. The fires brought no light to the hillock. The riders were not, however, content merely to wait for the dawn and let their enemies rest. A sudden outcry on the east side of the knoll showed that something was wrong. It seemed that some of the Men had ridden in close, slipped off their horses, crawled to the edge of the camp and killed several Orcs, and then had faded away again.

<div class="line_en">Grishnákh flung himself on the ground flat, dragging the hobbits under him; then he drew his sword. No doubt he meant to kill his captives, rather than allow them to escape or to be rescued; but it was his undoing. The sword rang faintly, and glinted a little in the light of the fire away to his left. An arrow came whistling out of the gloom: it was aimed with skill, or guided by fate, and it pierced his right hand. He dropped the sword and shrieked. There was a quick beat of hoofs, and even as Grishnákh leaped up and ran, he was ridden down and a spear passed through him. He gave a hideous shivering cry and lay still.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="葛力斯那克立刻趴在地上，将哈比人跟着一起拉倒；然后，他拔出了剑，毫无疑问是准备杀死这两名俘虏，不想让他们被救走或是逃脱，但这也给他带来了厄运。那把长剑在黑暗中反射出他左方篝火的光芒，一支羽箭从黑暗中呼啸而至，不知是命运的安排还是对方的神技使然，这支箭正中他的右手。他惨叫着丢下剑，急促的马啼声随即赶到，正当葛力斯那克站起来准备逃跑的时候，一柄长枪应声刺穿了他的身躯，他狂嚎一声倒在地上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The hobbits remained flat on the ground, as Grishnákh had left them. Another horseman came riding swiftly to his comrade's aid. Whether because of some special keenness of sight, or because of some other sense, the horse lifted and sprang lightly over them; but its rider did not see them, lying covered in their elven-cloaks, too crushed for the moment, and too afraid to move.</div>

<div class="line_en">The answer came almost immediately. The cries of Grishnákh had roused the Orcs. From the yells and screeches that came from the knoll the hobbits guessed that their disappearance had been discovered: Uglúk was probably knocking off a few more heads. Then suddenly the answering cries of orc-voices came from the right, outside the circle of watch-fires, from the direction of the forest and the mountains. Mauhúr had apparently arrived and was attacking the besiegers. There was the sound of galloping horses. The Riders were drawing in their ring close round the knoll, risking the orc-arrows, so as to prevent any sortie, while a company rode off to deal with the newcomers. Suddenly Merry and Pippin realized that without moving they were now outside the circle: there was nothing between them and escape.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="答案很快就出现了，葛力斯那克的惨叫声惊醒了半兽人，从高地上发出的吵杂声来看，他们的失踪已经被发现了，乌骨陆搞不好正在找人发泄他的怒气。然后，突然间，半兽人回应的呼喊声从右方包围圈之外传来，约莫是在山脉和森林的方向；很明显的，毛赫终于赶到了，现在正在攻击洛汗国的部队。随即传来的是急驰的马蹄声，骑士们冒着半兽人的箭矢缩小包围圈，避免有人趁机突围，另一队骑士则出面对付这些攻击者。在一阵兵荒马乱之后，皮聘和梅里才意识到他们竟然已经脱离了包围圈，已经没有任何力量可以阻止他们逃出这场战斗了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They crawled. The turf was deep and yielding, and that helped them; but it seemed a long slow business. They gave the watch-fire a wide berth, and wormed their way forward bit by bit, until they came to the edge of the river, gurgling away in the black shadows under its deep banks. Then they looked back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们就这样开始在草地上匍匐前进。这块草地的植物长得很高，正好帮助他们隐藏行迹，但这样爬起来似乎永远都爬不完似的。他们尽量远离四周的篝火，一寸一寸地往外爬，直到他们来到河边，可以听见黑暗中潺潺的水声为止，他们这才敢回头打量。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We must be off," he said. "Half a moment!" Grishnákh's sword was lying close at hand, but it was too heavy and clumsy for him to use; so he crawled forward, and finding the body of the goblin he drew from its sheath a long sharp knife. With this he quickly cut their bonds.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们必须立刻出发了，”他说：“等等！”葛力斯那克的长剑虽然就在他们脚边，但却沉重得让他们拿不动。因此，他悄悄地爬向前，找到半兽人腰间的一把锋利小刀；借着这柄工具的帮助，他俐落地割断了两人身上的束缚。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He slipped the cords off his wrists, and fished out a packet. The cakes were broken, but good, still in their leaf-wrappings. The hobbits each ate two or three pieces. The taste brought back to them the memory of fair faces, and laughter, and wholesome food in quiet days now far away. For a while they ate thoughtfully, sitting in the dark, heedless of the cries and sounds of battle nearby. Pippin was the first to come back to the present.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他挣脱了手腕上的绳子，掏出一块精灵的干粮，这块干粮虽然已经被压碎了，但它的叶子包装还完好如初。哈比人吃了几口，这味道立刻让他们回忆起那些美丽的面孔和笑语，以及许多天前所吃过的山珍海味。他们坐在黑暗中，若有所思地吃着，身边的战斗和惨呼似乎都与他们无关，皮聘是第一个恢复镇定的人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The sounds had died away. Evidently Mauhúr and his "lads" had been killed or driven off. The Riders had returned to their silent ominous vigil.

<div class="line_en">They turned and walked side by side slowly along the line of the river. Behind them the light grew in the East. As they walked they compared notes, talking lightly in hobbit-fashion of the things that had happened since their capture.

The Sun's limb was lifted, an arc of fire, above the margin of the world. Then with a great cry the Riders charged from the East; the red light gleamed on mail and spear. The Orcs yelled and shot all the arrows that remained to them. The hobbits saw several horsemen fall; but their line held on up the hill and over it, and wheeled round and charged again. Most of the raiders that were left alive then broke and fled, this way and that, pursued one by one to the death. But one band, holding together in a black wedge, drove forward resolutely in the direction of the forest. Straight up the slope they charged towards the watchers. Now they were drawing near, and it seemed certain that they would escape: they had already hewn down three Riders that barred their way.</div>
