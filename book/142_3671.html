<div class="line_en">On one sunny Sunday morning, while the women were at church, Don Vito Corleone dressed in his gardening uniform: baggy gray trousers, a faded blue shirt, battered dirty-brown fedora decorated by a stained gray silk hatband. The Don had gained considerable weight in his few years and worked on his tomato vines, he said, for the sake of his health. But he deceived no one.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在一个阳光明媚的星期天上午，娘儿们还在教堂里祷告的时候，维托·考利昂老头子穿的是他在菜园里劳动的那套服装：宽大的灰色裤子、褪了色的蓝衬衫、一顶显得很肮脏的褐色浅顶软呢帽。他这几年大大地发胖了：据他说，修剪修剪番前藤就是为了他的健康。但是，他不接见人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Michael Corleone had taken precautions against every eventuality. His planning was faultless, his security impeccable. He was patient, hoping to use the full year to prepare. But he was not to get his necessary year because fate itself took a stand against him, and in the most surprising fashion. For it was the Godfather, the great Don himself, who failed Michael Corleone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔·考利昂对一切变故事前都采取了预防措施。他的计划是万无一失的；他的安全防卫措施是无懈可击的。他很有能耐，希望用一年的时间做准备工作。但是他却得不到他所需要的一年时间，因为命运在同他作对，而且来得极其突然。使迈克尔·考利昂感到失望的恰恰就是教父——伟大的老头子本人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The truth was, he loved tending his garden; he loved the sight of it early on a morning. It brought back his childhood in Sicily sixty years ago, brought it back without the terror, the sorrow of his own father's death. Now the beans in their rows grew little white flowers on top; strong green stalks of scallion fenced everything in. At the foot of the garden a spouted barrel stood guard. It was filled with liquidy cow manure, the finest garden fertilizer. Also in that lower part of the garden were the square wooden frames he had built with his own hands, the sticks cross-tied with thick white string. Over these frames crawled the tomato vines.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="实际情况是他喜欢在菜园里劳动，喜欢菜园清晨的那种生机勃勃的景象，这往往使他回忆起小时候的情景。如今，一眼望去，一行行豆秧上开着小小的白花；周围种着亚实基隆葱，这种大葱的绿色主于很结实，像篱笆一样把菜园子围了起来。在菜园子的那一头放着一个有喷嘴的大木桶，屹立在那儿像个卫兵。桶里面装的是稀牛粪，这是菜园最理想的肥料。另外，在菜园较低的那一部分还有一片他亲手搭起来的方形枝条架，交叉着的枝条用绳子扎得紧紧的，枝条架上面爬着番前藤。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Don hastened to water his garden. It must be done before the sun waxed too hot and turned the water into a prism of fire that could burn his lettuce leaves like paper. Sun was more important than water, water also was important; but the two, imprudently mixed, could cause great misfortune.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="老头子忙着给菜园子浇水。浇水这个任务必须在太阳升起之前完成，不然的话，会把窝苣叶烧毁。阳光比水还重要，而水也是非常重要的，但要是这两者调配得不适当，就会造成严重后果。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Don moved through his garden hunting for ants. If ants were present, it meant that lice were in his vegetables and the ants were going after the lice and he would have to spray.</div>

<div class="line_en">He had watered just in time. The sun was becoming hot and the Don thought, "Prudence. Prudence." But there were just a few more plants to be supported by sticks and he bent down again. He would go back into the house when he finished this last row.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他及时完成了浇水工作。太阳变得越来越热，老头子心里想：“小心为是。小心为是。”他站起来想回家休息，但还有些菜秧需要用枝条撑起来，于是他又伏下身子继续干。他想给最后一行菜秧搭好枝条架就回家休息。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Quite suddenly it felt as if the sun had come down very close to his head. The air filled with dancing golden specks. Michael's oldest boy came running through the garden toward where the Don knelt and the boy was enveloped by a yellow shield of blinding light. But the Don was not to be tricked, he was too old a hand. Death hid behind that flaming yellow shield ready to pounce out on him and the Don with a wave of his hand warned the boy away from his presence. Just in time. The sledgehammer blow inside his chest made him choke for air. The Don pitched forward into the earth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然问，他感到好像太阳降下来了，离他的头很近很近，天空中充满了跳动的金色火花。迈克尔最大的男孩字穿过菜园子跑来了，向着老头子跪着的地方跑过来了，男孩子给一团耀眼的黄光包围起来了。但是，老头子并没有受到迷惑；他太老练了。死神就躲在那团像火焰一样的黄光背后，准备冲出来，向他扑过去。老头子挥手让男孩离开。刚好，不迟也不早，他蓦地一下感到胸腔里似乎有个大锤嘭嘭啪啪地打了起来，打得他喘不过气。老头子朝前一晃，一头栽倒在地。">查看中文翻译</div>

They lifted the Don up and carried him to the shade of his stone-flagged patio. Michael knelt beside his father, holding his hand, while the other men called for an ambulance and doctor.</div>

<div class="line_en">With a great effort the Don opened his eyes to see his son once more. The massive heart attack had turned his ruddy face almost blue. He was in extremis. He smelled the garden, the yellow shield of light smote his eyes, and he whispered, "Life is so beautiful."</div>

<div class="line_en">The funeral was royal. The Five Families sent their Dons and caporegimes, as did the Tessio and Clemenza Families. Johnny Fontane made the tabloid headlines by attending the funeral despite the advice of Michael not to appear. Fontane gave a statement to the newspapers that Vito Corleone was his Godfather and the finest man he had ever known and that he was honored to be permitted to pay his last respects to such a man and didn't give a damn who knew it.</div>

<div class="line_en">The wake was held in the house of the mall, in the old-fashioned style. Amerigo Bonasera had never done finer work, had discharged all obligations, by preparing his old friend and Godfather as lovingly as a mother prepares a bride for her wedding. Everyone commented on how not even death itself had been able to erase the nobility and the dignity of the great Don's countenance and such remarks made Amerigo Bonasera fill with knowing pride, a curious sense of power. Only he knew what a terrible massacre death had perpetrated on the Don's appearance.</div>

<div class="line_en">Outside the gates of the mall were the newspapermen and photographers and a small truck that was known to contain FBI men with their movie cameras recording this epic. Some newspapermen who tried to crash the funeral inside found that the gate and fence were manned with security guards who demanded identification and an invitation card. And though they were treated with the utmost courtesy, refreshment sent out to them, they were not permitted inside. They tried to speak with some of the people coming out but were met with stony stares and not a syllable.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was nearly ten years since there had been such a celebration of people in this house, nearly ten years since the wedding of Constanzia Corleone and Carlo Rizzi, so somebody said. Michael walked to the window that looked out on the garden. That long time ago he had sat in the garden with Kay never dreaming that so curious a destiny was to be his.

Michael could never remember his father ever having uttered a word about death, as if the Don respected death too much to philosophize about it.</div>

The baker Nazorine, the widow Colombo and her sons and all the countless others of his world he had ruled so firmly but justly.

<div class="line_en">Michael observed all this with a tight, polite smile. He was not impressed. Yet, he thought, if I can die saying, "Life is so beautiful," then nothing else is important. If I can believe in myself that much, nothing else matters. He would follow his father. He would care for his children, his family, his world. But his children would grow in a different world. They would be doctors, artists, scientists. Governors. Presidents. Anything at all. He would see to it that they joined the general family of humanity, but he, as a powerful and prudent parent would most certainly keep a wary eye on that general family.</div>

But I've got all the judges, we did that first, and some of the more important people in Congress. And the big party boys here in New York were no problem, of course. The Corleone Family is a lot stronger than anybody thinks, but I hoped to make it foolproof."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔懊丧地摇摇头。“还没有接通，我还需要四个月才行，老头子和我本来一直都在联系政治后门接头的移交工作。目前我已经同所有的法官都接上了头。这是我们首先抓的一项工作；再就是同国会中的一些头面人物接头。纽约市的大党魁，当然是不成问题的。其实，考利昂家族比任何人所想象的都要强大得多，不过我希望把事情办得万无一失。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And so the day before the meeting with the Barzini Family, Michael Corleone stood Godfather to the son of Carlo and Connie Rizzi. He presented the boy with an extremely expensive wristwatch and gold band. There was a small party in Carlo's house, to which were invited the caporegimes, Hagen, Lampone and everyone who lived on the mall, including, of course, the Don's widow. Connie was so overcome with emotion that she hugged and kissed her brother and Kay all during the evening. And even Carlo Rizzi became sentimental, wringing Michael's hand and calling him Godfather at every excuse -- old country style. Michael himself had never been so affable, so outgoing. Connie whispered to Kay, "I think Carlo and Mike are going to be real friends now. Something like this always brings people together."</div>
