<div class="line_en">The morning of Halloween I woke up thinking about Grans, which made me really sad and weepy. Dad kept telling me to hurry up and get dressed, which just stressed me out even more, and suddenly I started crying. I just wanted to stay home.</div>

<div class="line_en">This year was no different. August really wanted to be a Star Wars character called Boba Fett, so Mom looked for a Boba Fett costume in August's size, which, strangely enough, was out of stock everywhere. She went to every online store, found a few on eBay that were going for an outrageous amount, and finally ended up buying a Jango Fett costume that she then converted into a Boba Fett costume by painting it green. I would say, in all, she must have spent two weeks working on the stupid costume. And no, I won't mention the fact that Mom has never made any of my costumes, because it really has no bearing on anything at all.</div>

<div class="line_en">Grans had died the night before Halloween. Since then, even though it's been four years, this has always been a sad time of year for me. For Mom, too, though she doesn't always say it. Instead, she immerses herself in getting August's costume ready, since we all know Halloween is his favorite time of year.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="外婆是在感恩节前夜去世的。从那以后，虽然已经过去四年了，但这一天对我来说依然是一年中最悲伤的日子。妈妈也是，但她不怎么说。相反，她在全心全意地为奥古斯特准备万圣节服装，因为我们都知道，万圣节是他一年中最开心的日子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mom picked August up, and the moment he came home, he went straight to the bathroom and threw up. Then he went to his bed and pulled the covers over his head. Mom took his temperature, brought him some hot tea, and assumed the "August's mom" role again. "Via's mom," who had come out for a little while, was put away. I understood, though: August was in bad shape.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="妈妈把奥古斯特接了回来，他一进家门，就径自冲进卫生间呕吐了一番。然后，他上了床，用被子蒙住头。妈妈给他量了体温，为他送去热茶，又担当起“奥古斯特的妈妈”的角色。“维娅的妈妈”只出现了一小会儿就回去了。不过，我很理解：奥古斯特情绪很糟。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So Dad took August to school that morning and Mom said I could stay home, and the two of us cried together for a while. One thing I knew for sure: however much I missed Grans, Mom must have missed her more. All those times August was clinging to life after a surgery, all those rush trips to the ER: Grans had always been there for Mom. It felt good to cry with Mom. For both of us. At some point, Mom had the idea of our watching The Ghost and Mrs. Muir together, which was one of our all-time favorite black-and-white movies. I agreed that that was a great idea. I think I probably would have used this weeping session as an opportunity to tell Mom everything that was going on at school with Miranda and Ella, but just as we were sitting down in front of the DVD player, the phone rang. It was the nurse from August's school calling to tell Mom that August had a stomach ache and should be picked up. So much for the old movies and the mother-daughter bonding.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天早晨结果是爸爸送奥古斯特去上的学，妈妈说，我可以待在家里，我们俩一起哭了一会儿。有一件事我很确定：不管我有多么想念外婆，妈妈一定更想念她。多少次奥古斯特做完手术，命悬一线，多少次匆匆忙忙赶往急救室，外婆总是陪伴在妈妈身边。能跟妈妈一起哭一场，感觉很不错。这对我们俩来讲都是好事。哭着哭着，妈妈提议一起看《幽灵与未亡人》，这一直是我们最喜爱的黑白电影。我觉得这个主意很棒。我想，也许我会利用这个同哭的机会向妈妈倾诉在学校里跟米兰达和艾拉的所有过节。但是我们刚刚在DVD前坐下来，电话响了。是奥古斯特学校的护士打来的，她告诉妈妈，奥古斯特肚子疼，最好把他接回家。于是，“老电影和母女情深”到此为止。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Neither one of us asked him why he had worn his Bleeding Scream costume to school instead of the Boba Fett costume Mom had made for him. If it annoyed Mom to see the costume she had worked on for two weeks tossed on the floor, unused, she didn't show it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们俩都没有问他为什么穿骷髅幽灵服，而不是妈妈为他特制的波巴·费特的衣服去上学。不知道妈妈看见自己用两个星期做的衣服穿都没穿就被扔在地上会不会生气——她没有表露出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
