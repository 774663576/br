<div class="line_en">Dying would be easier, he knew. All he had to do was crawl inside his cave and let the ship pass by, and death would find him. For days now the fever had been burning through him, turning his bowels to brown water and making him shiver in his restless sleep. Each morning found him weaker. It will not be much longer, he had taken to telling himself.</div>

<div class="line_en">If the fever did not kill him, thirst surely would. He had no fresh water here, but for the occasional rainfall that pooled in hollows on the rock. Only three days past (or had it been four? On his rock, it was hard to tell the days apart) his pools had been dry as old bone, and the sight of the bay rippling green and grey all around him had been almost more than he could bear. Once he began to drink seawater the end would come swiftly, he knew, but all the same he had almost taken that first swallow, so parched was his throat. A sudden squall had saved him. He had grown so feeble by then that it was all he could do to lie in the rain with his eyes closed and his mouth open, and let the water splash down on his cracked lips and swollen tongue. But afterward he felt a little stronger, and the island's pools and cracks and crevices once more had brimmed with life.</div>

<div class="line_en">And if not thirst or fever, starvation would kill him. His island was no more than a barren spire jutting up out of the immensity of Blackwater Bay. When the tide was low, he could sometimes find tiny crabs along the stony strand where he had washed ashore after the battle. They nipped his fingers painfully before he smashed them apart on the rocks to suck the meat from their claws and the guts from their shells.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="退一万步讲，就算没有高烧和干渴，饥饿同样会要命。他所在之地不过是辽阔的黑水湾中一块突出的荒石。潮落之时，会有细小的螃蟹吸附在石滩上——他在战斗过后也是被冲刷到这里来的。他在岩石上撞碎它们，吮吸爪子里的肉和壳里的内脏。螃蟹们总把他的手夹得生痛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But the strand vanished whenever the tide came rushing in, and Davos had to scramble up the rock to keep from being swept out into the bay once more. The point of the spire was fifteen feet above the water at high tide, but when the bay grew rough the spray went even higher, so there was no way to keep dry, even in his cave (which was really no more than a hollow in the rock beneath an overhang). Nothing grew on the rock but lichen, and even the seabirds shunned the place. Now and again some gulls would land atop the spire and Davos would try to catch one, but they were too quick for him to get close. He took to flinging stones at them, but he was too weak to throw with much force, so even when his stones hit the gulls would only scream at him in annoyance and then take to the air.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="潮起之时，石滩会消失，戴佛斯不得不慌忙爬上岩石，以免再次被冲进海湾。满潮时分，岩石顶端比海平面高出十五尺，但海湾里的浪很高，因而无法保持身上干燥，就算躲进洞里也没用（说真的，所谓的洞不过是岩石中的大窟窿）。石礁上除了青苔之外什么也不长，海鸥也不来这儿。时而有些幼鸟会停在尖顶上，戴佛斯不断尝试抓它们的方法，可每当他靠拢，它们便飞快地离开。他扔石子，却虚弱得发不上力，即便击中目标，也只能惹得海鸟对他恼怒尖叫，接着拍拍翅膀远走高飞。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But that had been three days ago (or maybe four), and most of the water was gone now. Some had evaporated, and he had sucked up the rest. By the morrow he would be tasting the mud again, and licking the damp cold stones at the bottom of the depressions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但这是三天（或四天？）前的事了，而今水已消失殆尽。有些被蒸发，剩下的他吮了个干净，等到明天，又得吮吸污泥，以及从洼穴底部挖到的潮湿冷硬的石头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There were other rocks visible from his refuge, distant stony spires taller than his own. The nearest stood a good forty feet above the water, he guessed, though it was hard to be sure at this distance. A cloud of gulls swirled about it constantly, and often Davos thought of crossing over to raid their nests. But the water was cold here, the currents strong and treacherous, and he knew he did not have the strength for such a swim. That would kill him as sure as drinking seawater.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从他的避难所，可以望见其他石礁，有的似乎比他这块要高。别的不说，虽然目测可能出现误差，但他认为最近那块至少比海平面高出四十尺。更诱人的是，那儿常盘旋着一大群海鸥，戴佛斯幻想游过去侵夺它们的巢穴。可海水冰凉，潮流多变而剧烈，自己又没力气。如此的举动和喝海水无异，同样会要命。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Autumn in the narrow sea could often be wet and rainy, he remembered from years past. The days were not bad so long as the sun was shining, but the nights were growing colder and sometimes the wind would come gusting across the bay, driving a line of whitecaps before it, and before long Davos would be soaked and shivering. Fever and chills assaulted him in turn, and of late he had developed a persistent racking cough.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="多年的海上生涯使他明白狭海的秋季总是潮湿而多雨。因为日照转弱，白天倒不太难过，可夜里却越来越冷。海风不时刮过海湾，卷起道道白色的浪涛，湿透了戴佛斯，让他浑身颤抖。在高烧和寒冷的轮番攻击下，很快他便开始持续而痛苦的咳嗽。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His cave was all the shelter he had, and that was little enough. Driftwood and bits of charred debris would wash up on the strand during low tide, but he had no way to strike a spark or start a fire. Once, in desperation, he had tried rubbing two pieces of driftwood against each other, but the wood was rotted, and his efforts earned him only blisters. His clothes were sodden as well, and he had lost one of his boots somewhere in the bay before he washed up here.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="洞穴是他唯一的遮蔽所，却远远不够。退潮之际，漂流的木头和烧焦的残骸不时被冲刷到石滩上来，可它们无法打出火花。曾有一次，在绝望中，他试着摩擦两片浮木，但木头业已彻底腐朽，他的努力只换回几大块水疱。衣服没有干过，而来此之前一只鞋就已在海湾中遗失。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But now there was a sail; only a speck on the horizon, but growing larger. A ship where no ship should be. He knew where his rock lay, more or less; it was one of a series of sea monts that rose from the floor of Blackwater Bay. The tallest of them jutted a hundred feet above the tide, and a dozen lesser monts stood thirty to sixty feet high. Sailors called them spears of the merling king, and knew that for every one that broke the surface, a dozen lurked treacherously just below it. Any captain with sense kept his course well away from them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="偏偏这时，远方却出现了那只帆，起初还只是地平线上一个斑点，而今却越变越大。这里不该有船的。他知道石礁的位置，此地乃黑水湾中一系列海底山脉突出的地方，称为美人鱼礁。其中最高的比海面高出一百尺，还有十来个高出三十至六十尺的小型尖顶，水手们呼作“人鱼王之矛”。这里每块尖顶都有详细记录，水手们更互相警告潜藏于水下、范围更广的暗礁，总而言之，任何有理智的船长都会远远避开。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Thirst; hunger; exposure. They were his companions, with him every hour of every day, and in time he had come to think of them as his friends. Soon enough, one or the other of his friends would take pity on him and free him from this endless misery. Or perhaps he would simply walk into the water one day, and strike out for the shore that he knew lay somewhere to the north, beyond his sight. It was too far to swim, as weak as he was, but that did not matter. Davos had always been a sailor; he was meant to die at sea. The gods beneath the waters have been waiting for me, he told himself. It's past time I went to them.</div>

<div class="line_en">They had sailed up the Blackwater Rush flying the fiery heart of the Lord of Light. Davos and Black Betha had been in the second line of battle, between Dale's Wraith and Allard on Lady Marya. Maric his thirdborn was oarmaster on Fury, at the center of the first line, while Matthos served as his father's second. Beneath the walls of the Red Keep Stannis Baratheon's galleys had joined in battle with the boy king Joffrey's smaller fleet, and for a few moments the river had rung to the thrum of bowstrings and the crash of iron rams shattering oars and hulls alike.</div>

<div class="line_en">And then some vast beast had let out a roar, and green flames were all around them: wildfire, pyromancer's piss, the jade demon. Matthos had been standing at his elbow on the deck of Black Betha when the ship seemed to lift from the water. Davos found himself in the river, flailing as the current took him and spun him around and around. Upstream, the flames had ripped at the sky, fifty feet high. He had seen Black Betha afire, and Fury, and a dozen other ships, had seen burning men leaping into the water to drown. Wraith and Lady Marya were gone, sunk or shattered or vanished behind a veil of wildfire, and there was no time to look for them, because the mouth of the river was almost upon him, and across the mouth of the river the Lannisters had raised a great iron chain. From bank to bank there was nothing but burning ships and wildfire. The sight of it seemed to stop his heart for a moment, and he could still remember the sound of it, the crackle of flames, the hiss of steam, the shrieks of dying men, and the beat of that terrible heat against his face as the current swept him down toward hell.</div>

<div class="line_en">Instead he sucked in a great gulp of air and dove, kicking for the bottom of the river. His only hope was to pass under the chain and the burning ships and the wildfire that floated on the surface of the water, to swim hard for the safety of the bay beyond. Davos had always been a strong swimmer, and he'd wom no steel that day, but for the helm he'd lost when he'd lost Black Betha. As he knifed through the green murk, he saw other men struggling beneath the water, pulled down to drown beneath the weight of plate and mail. Davos swam past them, kicking with all the strength left in his legs, giving himself up to the current, the water filling his eyes. Deeper he went, and deeper, and deeper still. With every stroke it grew harder to hold his breath. He remembered seeing the bottom, soft and dim, as a stream of bubbles burst from his lips. Something touched his leg… a snag or a fish or a drowning man, he could not tell.</div>

<div class="line_en">He needed air by then, but he was afraid. Was he past the chain yet, was he out in the bay? If he came up under a ship he would drown, and if he surfaced amidst the floating patches of wildfire his first breath would sear his lungs to ash. He twisted in the water to look up, but there was nothing to see but green darkness and then he spun too far and suddenly he could no longer tell up from down. Panic took hold of him. His hands flailed against the bottom of the river and sent up a cloud of mud that blinded him. His chest was growing tighter by the instant. He clawed at the water, kicking, pushing himself, turning, his lungs screaming for air, kicking, kicking, lost now in the river murk, kicking, kicking, kicking until he could kick no longer. When he opened his mouth to scream, the water came rushing in, tasting of salt, and Davos Seaworth knew that he was drowning.</div>

When they find me dead here, if ever they do, perhaps they will name the rock for me, he thought. Onion Rock, they'll call it; it will be my tombstone and my legacy. He deserved no more.

Inside he kept the bones of the four fingers his king had shortened for him, on the day he made Davos a knight. My luck. His shortened fingers patted at his chest, groping, finding nothing. The pouch was gone, and the fingerbones with them. Stannis could never understand why he'd kept the bones. "To remind me of my king's justice," he whispered through cracked lips. But now they were gone. The fire took my luck as well as my sons. In his dreams the river was still aflame and demons danced upon the waters with fiery whips in their hands, while men blackened and burned beneath the lash. "Mother, have mercy," Davos prayed. "Save me, gentle Mother, save us all. My luck is gone, and my sons." He was weeping freely now, salt tears streaming down his cheeks. "The fire took it all… the fire…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的手伸向咽喉，摸索着一直戴在颈项上的小皮袋，里面保留着他的国王册封他为骑士当天，削下的四根指节。我的幸运符。短指在胸前拍打、摸索，什么也没找到。袋子不见了，连同里面的指骨一起。史坦尼斯一直不理解他为何要留着这些骨头。“提醒我谨记吾王的公正，”他用破裂的嘴唇低语。而今连它们也不见了，大火像带走我的孩子们一样带走了我的幸运符。在梦中，河上的火焰从未熄灭，手持火鞭的魔鬼在水面舞蹈，活人在抽打下燃烧，化为焦炭。“圣母啊，发发慈悲吧，”戴佛斯祈求，“救救我，温柔的圣母，救救我们大家。我的幸运符丢了，我的孩子们死了。”他无法抑制地嚎啕大哭，咸咸的泪水在面颊积成小溪。“火带走了一切…火…”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Perhaps it was only wind blowing against the rock, or the sound of the sea on the shore, but for an instant Davos Seaworth heard her answer.

<div class="line_en">"It was her!" Davos cried. "Mother, don't forsake us. It was her who burned you, the red woman, Melisandre, her!" He could see her; the heart-shaped face, the red eyes, the long coppery hair, her red gowns moving like flames as she walked, a swirl of silk and satin. She had come from Asshai in the east, she had come to Dragonstone and won Selsye and her queen's men for her alien god, and then the king, Stannis Baratheon himself. He had gone so far as to put the fiery heart on his banners, the fiery heart of R'hllor, Lord of Light and God of Flame and Shadow. At Melisandre's urging, he had dragged the Seven from their sept at Dragonstone and burned them before the castle gates, and later he had burned the godswood at Storm's End as well, even the heart tree, a huge white weirwood with a solemn face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是她干的！”戴佛斯哭喊，“圣母啊，请不要将我们抛弃。是她干的，那红袍女，梅丽珊卓，是她！”她仿佛出现在眼前：心形的脸蛋、红色的眼睛、红铜的长发，她穿着红色的长礼服，由丝绸和缎子所制，走起路来有如火焰在移动。她来自东方的亚夏，在龙石岛上，用异乡的神灵俘获了赛丽丝和王后门下的贵族，接着又俘获了国王史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩的心。国王走得太远，竟把烈焰红心当成自己的旗帜，侍侯光之王拉赫洛，圣焰之心，影子与烈火的真主。在梅丽珊卓的力促下，他把龙石岛圣堂里的七神神像全拖出来，在城门口焚烧；后来还烧毁了风息堡的神木林，甚至那棵刻着庄重面容的巨大白色鱼梁木也没能逃脱厄运。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It was her work," Davos said again, more weakly. Her work, and yours, onion knight. You rowed her into Storm's End in the black of night, so she might loose her shadow child. You are not guiltless, no. You rode beneath her banner and flew it from your mast. You watched the Seven burn at Dragonstone, and did nothing. She gave the Father's justice to the fire, and the Mother's mercy, and the wisdom of the Crone. Smith and Stranger, Maid and Warrior, she burnt them all to the glory of her cruel god, and you stood and held your tongue. Even when she killed old Maester Cressen, even then, you did nothing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是她干的，”戴佛斯重复，只觉言语加倍地无力。是她干的，可你是帮凶，洋葱骑士。在那个漆黑的夜晚，是你载她潜进风息堡，放出阴影之子。你不是无辜，你怎么可能无辜？你在她的旗帜下骑行，在她的旗帜下航海，你眼睁睁看着七神在龙石岛被焚烧，什么也没做。公正的天父、慈悲的圣母、睿智的老妪，铁匠和陌客，少女与战士，统统被她奉献给那残酷的神灵，而你只是静静地站着，闭上嘴巴。即便她杀害了克礼森老师傅，即便目睹了如此暴行，你仍旧什么也没做。">查看中文翻译</div>

There was something he had to do.</div>

<div class="line_en">A crewman on her forecastle saw him and pointed. He watched as other sailors moved to the gunwale to gape at him. A short while later the galley's sail came down, her oars slid out, and she swept around toward his refuge. She was too big to approach the rock closely, but thirty yards away she launched a small boat. Davos clung to his rock and watched it creep toward him. Four men were rowing, while a fifth sat in the prow. "You," the fifth man called out when they were only a few feet from his island, "you up on the rock. Who are you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="艏楼上一名水手发现了他，指指点点。他看见其他船员奔向船舷，目瞪口呆地打量他。帆降下来，桨也收起，她开始朝他的避难所转舵。来船很大，不可能靠近，于是在三十码的距离外，她放出一艘小艇。戴佛斯趴在岩石上，盯着小艇靠拢。四个人在划，第五个人站在船首。“你，”当小艇离石礁只剩几尺时，对方发话道，“岩石上的这个人。你是谁？”">查看中文翻译</div>

She was Lysene, she was Salladhor Saan's. The Mother sent her here, the Mother in her mercy. She had a task for him. Stannis lives, he knew then. I have a king still. And sons, I have other sons, and a wife loyal and loving. How could he have forgotten? The Mother was merciful indeed. "Stannis," he shouted back at the Lyseni.
