<div class="line_en">Most of all, of course, I thought about Laura. Many letters came from her, but she said very little in them. She told me she was well, but hardly mentioned her husband, and wrote not a word about Count Fosco, whom they had met in Austria, not Italy. I understood from her silence that she did not like him. All she said was that her Aunt Eleanor, Madame Fosco, was quieter and more sensible than she had used to be.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我最思念的当然是劳拉。她来过许多信，但是内容都非常简单。她说她挺好的，却只字不提她丈夫，也不提福斯科伯爵。他们是在奥地利相见的，而不是在意大利。从她的沉默我看得出，她不喜欢他。她只是说到埃莉诺姑妈，就是福斯科夫人，比以前话少了，也更理智了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Six long, lonely months passed, and I had little to do but think of absent friends. I received a cheerful letter from Walter Hartright after he arrived in Honduras, and just before he set off with the expedition into the forest. Since then, I have heard nothing. There was no news of Anne Catherick or Mrs Clements. Poor Mr Gilmore fell very ill and had to give up work, but his business is continued by his partner, Mr Kyrle. Mrs Vesey has moved to London to live with her sister, and Mr Fairlie, I believe, is secretly delighted to have his house free of women.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="漫长、孤寂的六个月过去了。除去思念不在身边的朋友们，我无所事事。我收到一封沃尔特·哈特里特的来信，是他到达洪都拉斯，进入林地之前写的。从那以后，他就没有了任何消息。安妮·凯瑟里克和克莱门茨太太没有任何音信。可怜的吉尔摩先生病得很厉害，不得不停止工作。他的工作由他的合伙人克尔先生代理。维西太太搬到了伦敦，和她妹妹住在一起。我想费尔利先生一定暗自高兴这庄园里没有了女人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On 11th June I arrived at Blackwater Park, Sir Percival's family home in Hampshire. The waiting was nearly over, and how happy I was! The next day Laura and her husband would return home, together with Count Fosco and his wife, who were going to spend the summer at Blackwater.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="6月11日，我来到布莱克沃特庄园，珀西瓦尔爵士在汉普郡的家。等待终于快结束了，我异常兴奋。第二天，劳拉同她丈夫就要回来了，一同来的还有福斯科伯爵夫妇，他们要在布莱克沃特度过这个夏天。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the morning the housekeeper, Mrs Michelson, showed me round the house. It is very old, and much of it is dusty and unused; only one part of the enormous building is comfortable enough to live in.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="早上，管家米切尔森太太领我参观了房子。这是一幢很古老的房子，多处是厚厚的尘土，没有人住。偌大的房子只有一部分还比较舒适，可以住人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Later I explored the gardens and the park. The gardens are small and not well kept, and there are so many trees that the house feels shut in by them. I found a path through the trees, which after half a mile brought me to a lake. It was a damp, lonely place. The still dark waters of the lake and the long shadows from the tall trees gave it a gloomy air. Near the lake there was an old boat-house with some seats in it, so I went in and sat down for a rest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="之后，我去看了看花园和园林。花园很小，维护得也不好。这周围树木非常多，遮蔽了房子。我发现了树林中的一条小路，沿着小路走了半英里之后是一个湖。这是一个潮湿僻静的地方。平静漆黑的湖水和长长的树影使这里笼上了一层阴暗、凄凉的色彩。湖的附近有一个破旧的船屋，里面有几个座位，我走进去坐下休息。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I am not a nervous person generally but when I heard the sound of quick breathing under my seat, I jumped to my feet in alarm.

<div class="line_cn" title="我并不是一个胆小的人，但是听见座位底下传来急促的喘息声，我还是惊得一下子跳了起来。其实，那是只狗——一只黑白相间的小狗，身子的一侧有子弹的伤痕。我把可怜的小东西带回房子里，叫来米切尔森太太帮我。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Later that evening the travellers returned. After my first happiness at meeting Laura, I felt there was a strangeness between us and I realized she had changed. I was sure we would soon get back to normal, but she had lost her innocent openness. She was unwilling to talk about her married life, and I saw that there were no warm feelings between her husband and her. It wasn't long before she asked me about Walter -- "Have you heard from him? Is he well and happy?" -- and it was clear to me that she loved him as deeply as ever.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当天晚上，旅行者们都回来了。我见到劳拉的高兴劲儿刚过，就觉得我们之间有一种奇怪的感觉，我意识到她变了。我相信，我们之间很快就会像从前一样。但是她好像失去了原来的纯真和坦诚。她不愿谈自己的婚后生活，而且我发现她同她丈夫之间毫无亲密可言。她很快就向我问起沃尔特：“你收到他的信了吗？他好吗？”显而易见，她还在深深地爱着他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As for Sir Percival, his manners are sharper and less pleasant. On meeting me he simply said, "Hello, Miss Halcombe. Glad to see you again," -- and then walked past me. Little things seem to annoy him a great deal. For example, the housekeeper told him a man had called to speak to him a week ago but had left no name. Sir Percival demanded a description of the man, which poor Mrs Michelson was unable to give, and Sir Percival stormed out of the room in great anger.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="至于珀西瓦尔爵士，他的脾气变得越发暴躁，越发不讨人喜欢。见到我，他只是简单地说了声“你好，哈尔库姆小姐。很高兴又见到你。”然后就从我身边走过去了。一点点小事也会让他大为恼火。举个例子，米切尔森太太告诉他一个星期前有个男人来找他，但没有留下姓名。珀西瓦尔爵士问那人什么模样，可怜的米切尔森太太说不上来，于是珀西瓦尔爵士勃然大怒，气急败坏地走出房间。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And the man who has achieved this extraordinary change, the man who has tamed this wild Englishwoman? Yes, what can I say about the Count? He looks like a man who could tame anything. If he had married me, I would have made his cigarettes, as his wife does. I would have held my tongue when he looked at me, as she holds hers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那么，那个导致了如此变化，驯服了这么一个桀骜不驯的英国女人的男人呢？对，我该怎么描述伯爵呢？他好像可以驯服一切。假如他娶了我，我也会像他妻子一样给他卷烟，我也会像她一样被他看一眼就闭上嘴。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Laura was certainly right about Madame Fosco. Never have I seen such a change in a woman. As Eleanor Fairlie (aged thirty-seven), she wore bright clothes, was silly and foolish, and always talked nonsense. As Madame Fosco (aged forty-three), she wears only grey or black, and sits for hours in silence, doing needlework, rolling up cigarettes for the Count, or just looking at him with the eyes of a loyal dog.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="关于福斯科夫人，劳拉说得很对。我从未见过哪个女人身上会发生如此大的变化。她是埃莉诺·费尔利小姐的时候（当时她37岁），经常穿鲜亮的衣服，说傻话，做傻事。她成了福斯科夫人以后（现在她43岁），只穿灰色和黑色的衣服，而且经常几个小时坐在那里一声不吭地做针线，给伯爵卷烟或者像一条忠诚的狗一样望着伯爵。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Count seemed fascinated by Mrs Catherick and wanted to know all about her visit. I tried to say as little as possible, but Laura asked questions too, and in the end the Count knew as much as we did about Mrs Catherick and her daughter Anne. I was quite sure, from his surprise at the story, that the Count had known nothing of Anne Catherick, and uneasily I wondered why Sir Percival had not told his closest friend.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伯爵似乎对凯瑟里克太太非常感兴趣，想了解她那次来的所有情况。我尽量少透露信息，可是劳拉也问这问那。最后，我们知道的关于凯瑟里克太太以及她女儿安妮的情况，伯爵全都知道了。从伯爵惊讶的表情我可以断定，在这之前他对安妮·凯瑟里克一无所知。我很纳闷，为什么珀西瓦尔爵士不告诉他的好朋友这些事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I had begun to realize that I could not hope to remain at Blackwater Park now without the influence and support of the Count, so I answered by thanking him warmly. Then I led Laura out and took her up to my room for a rest.</div>

<div class="line_en">While we were there, she told me how cruel Sir Percival had been to her since their marriage and how unhappy she was. I tried to calm her and to find a solution to the problem of the signature. Suddenly I had the idea of writing to Mr Gilmore's partner, Mr Kyrle, and asking for his advice. In my letter I also asked him to get a messenger to bring the reply by one o'clock the next day. I then put the letter in the post-bag in the hall. Just at that moment Madame Fosco appeared and asked to speak to me in the garden. She spoke to me for a full half-hour about how much sympathy she had for me. I found this very odd indeed since she had shown very little interest in me before.</div>
