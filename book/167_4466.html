<div class="line_en">Varys stood over the brazier, warming his soft hands. "It would appear Renly was murdered most fearfully in the very midst of his army. His throat was opened from ear to ear by a blade that passed through steel and bone as if they were soft cheese."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Have you ever considered that too many answers are the same as no answer at all? My informers are not always as highly placed as we might like. When a king dies, fancies sprout like mushrooms in the dark. A groom says that Renly was slain by a knight of his own Rainbow Guard. A washerwoman claims Stannis stole through the heart of his brother's army with his magic sword. Several men-at-arms believe a woman did the fell deed, but cannot agree on which woman. A maid that Renly had spurned, claims one. A camp follower brought in to serve his pleasure on the eve of battle, says a second. The third ventures that it might have been the Lady Catelyn Stark."</div>

<div class="line_en">Tyrion had heard enough. "Joff will be so disappointed," he said. "He was saving such a nice spike for Renly's head. But whoever did the deed, we must assume Stannis was behind it. The gain is clearly his." He did not like this news; he had counted on the brothers Baratheon decimating each other in bloody battle. He could feel his elbow throbbing where the morningstar had laid it open. It did that sometimes in the damp. He squeezed it uselessly in his hand and asked, "What of Renly's host?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="提利昂听够了。“只怕小乔要失望了，”他说，“他为蓝礼的脑袋准备了那么锋利的长枪。总之呢，不管谁下的手，幕后策划都该是史坦尼斯。事情很明显，他是得益者。”这实在不是个好消息，他原指望拜拉席恩兄弟血战一场，两败俱伤。肘部从前被流星锤砸中的地方隐隐作痛，每当天气潮湿，就会这样犯病。他一边徒劳地揉搓，一边问，“蓝礼的军队呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“许多，”提利昂强调，“不是全部？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Not all," agreed the eunuch. "Not Loras Tyrell, nor Randyll Tarly, nor Mathis Rowan. And Storm's End itself has not yielded. Ser Cortnay Penrose holds the castle in Renly's name, and will not believe his liege is dead. He demands to see the mortal remains before he opens his gates, but it seems that Renly's corpse has unaccountably vanished. Carried away, most likely. A fifth of Renly's knights departed with Ser Loras rather than bend the knee to Stannis. It's said the Knight of Flowers went mad when he saw his king's body, and slew three of Renly's guards in his wrath, among them Emmon Cuy and Robar Royce."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不是全部，”太监确认。“不包括洛拉斯·提利尔，不包括蓝道·塔利，也不包括马图斯·罗宛。此外，风息堡的守军没有投降，科塔奈·庞洛斯爵士以蓝礼之名坚守城堡，拒绝相信主君已死。他坚持要亲眼目睹遗体方肯打开城门，但蓝礼的尸体竟莫名其妙失踪了，很可能被谁藏了起来。蓝礼麾下的骑士约有五分之一跟洛拉斯爵士一同离开，不愿效忠史坦尼斯。据说百花骑士一见国王的尸体就发了疯，盛怒之下连斩三名蓝礼的护卫，其中包括埃蒙·库伊和罗拔·罗伊斯。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The greater part of his foot remains at Bitterbridge." Varys abandoned the brazier to take his seat at the table. "Most of the lords who rode with Lord Renly to Storm's End have gone over banner-and-blade to Stannis, with all their chivalry."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他把大队步兵留在苦桥。”瓦里斯离开火盆，坐回议事桌边的座位。“但那些跟随蓝礼大人星夜奔赴风息堡的领主们，大都降旗投靠了史坦尼斯，请注意，这几乎代表着全南境的骑兵。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="可惜，他才杀三个就住了手，提利昂心想。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Ser Loras is likely making for Bitterbridge," Varys went on. "His sister is there, Renly's queen, as well as a great many soldiers who suddenly find themselves kingless. Which side will they take now? A ticklish question. Many serve the lords who remained at Storm's End, and those lords now belong to Stannis."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“洛拉斯爵士应是往苦桥去了，”瓦里斯续道，“他的妹妹——蓝礼的王后——还留在那里。现在的情况是，留在当地的众多士兵突然失去了国王，不知何去何从。他们所侍奉的领主有不少在风息堡投靠了史坦尼斯。而这些小卒该怎么走？他们自己也不明白。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Is their love for us any greater?" asked Cersei.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“难道他们比较喜欢我们？”瑟曦反问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tyrion leaned forward. "There is a chance here, it seems to me. Win Loras Tyrell to our cause and Lord Mace Tyrell and his bannermen might join us as well. They may have sworn their swords to Stannis for the moment, yet they cannot love the man, or they would have been his from the start."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="提利昂倾身向前，“依我看，这正是我们的机会。只需把洛拉斯·提利尔争取过来，就有机会吸纳梅斯·提利尔和高庭的势力。他们或许暂时倾向史坦尼斯，但不可能喜欢那个人，否则从一开始就追随他了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Scarcely," said Tyrion. "They loved Renly, clearly, but Renly is slain. Perhaps we can give them good and sufficient reasons to prefer Joffrey to Stannis… if we move quickly."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Have you been to our markets of late, Lord Varys?" asked Littlefinger. "You'd find it easier to buy a lord than a chicken, I daresay. Of course, lords cluck prouder than chickens, and take it ill if you offer them coin like a tradesman, but they are seldom adverse to taking gifts… honors, lands, castles…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你最近上市场吗，瓦里斯大人？”小指头问，“我敢说，买个诸侯绝对比买只鸡容易。当然了，诸侯的叫声比鸡高傲，而且你要是像商人一样直接标价做买卖，他们会很反感，但对于到手的礼物…以及荣誉，土地，城堡等等…他们可是却之不恭。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yes, Tyrion thought. "It seems to me we should take a lesson from the late Lord Renly. We can win the Tyrell alliance as he did. With a marriage."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不谋而舍，提利昂心想。“我认为，已故的蓝礼大人给我们好好上了一课，应该像他一样利用联姻争取提利尔的同盟。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I do." Renly's young queen was no more than fifteen, sixteen, he seemed to recall… older than Joffrey, but a few years were nothing, it was so neat and sweet he could taste it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对。”他依稀记得蓝礼的年轻王后不过十五六岁…比乔佛里稍大，但也就大几岁，况且她是那么美丽迷人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">No, it was a matter of some pretty teats. After that business in the yard, Tyrion had spoken with Varys about how they might arrange for Joffrey to visit Chataya's. A taste of honey might sweeten the boy, he hoped. He might even be grateful, gods forbid, and Tyrion could do with a shade more gratitude from his sovereign. It would need to be done secretly, of course. The tricky bit would be parting him from the Hound. "The dog is never far from his master's heels," he'd observed to Varys, "but all men sleep. And some gamble and whore and visit winesinks as well."</div>

<div class="line_en">"The Hand speaks with the king's voice." Candlelight gleamed green as wildfire in Cersei's eyes. "If we send you, Tyrion, it will be as if Joffrey went himself. And who better, You wield words as skillfully as Jaime wields a sword."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“首相正是国王的代言人。”烛光在瑟曦眼中如碧绿的野火一样燃烧，“我们该派你去，提利昂，如此便和乔佛里亲临没有分别。哪里有更好的人选呢？你说话就跟詹姆使剑一般厉害。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He has us. Tyrion did not trust Petyr Baelish, nor did he want the man out of his sight, yet what other choice was left him? It must be Littlefinger or Tyrion himself, and he knew full well that if he left King's Landing for any length of time, all that he had managed to accomplish would be undone. "There is fighting between here and Bitterbridge," he said cautiously. "And you can be past certain that Lord Stannis will be dispatching his own shepherds to gather in his brother's wayward lambs."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他能说服我们。提利昂不信任培提尔·贝里席，不想让他离开视线范围，但他有别的选择吗？此事非他自己或小指头出面不可，而他完全清楚，只要他踏出君临，不论时间长短，所有的苦心全得半途而废。“此去苦桥路途凶险，”他谨慎地说，“可以肯定，史坦尼斯公爵会放出自己的牧羊犬来接管弟弟手下任性的羔羊。”">查看中文翻译</div>
