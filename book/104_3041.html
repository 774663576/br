<div class="line_en">Ramsdale revisited. I approached it from the side of the lake. The sunny noon was all eyes. As I rode by in my mud-flecked car, I could distinguish scintillas of diamond water between the far pines. I turned into the cemetery and walked among the long and short stone monuments. Bonzhur, Charlotte. On some of the graves there were pale, transparent little national flags slumped in the windless air under the evergreens. Gee, Ed, that was bad luck -- referring to G. Edward Grammar, a thirty-five-year-old New York office manager who had just been arrayed on a charge of murdering his thirty-three-year-old wife, Dorothy. Bidding for the perfect crime, Ed had bludgeoned his wife and put her into a car. The case came to light when two county policemen on patrol saw Mrs. Grammar's new big blue Chrysler, an anniversary present from her husband, speeding crazily down a hill, just inside their jurisdiction (God bless our good cops!). The car sideswiped a pole, ran up an embankment covered with beard grass, wild strawberry and cinquefoil, and overturned. The wheels were still gently spinning in the mellow sunlight when the officers removed Mrs. G's body. It appeared to be a routine highway accident at first. Alas, the woman's battered body did not match up with only minor damage suffered by the car. I did better.</div>

<div class="line_en">Should I enter my old house? As in a Turgenev story, a torrent of Italian music came from an open window -- that of the living room: what romantic soul was playing the piano where no piano had plunged and plashed on that bewitched Sunday with the sun on her beloved legs? All at once I noticed that from the lawn I had mown a golden-skinned, brown-haired nymphet of nine or ten, in white shorts, was looking at me with wild fascination in her large blue-black eyes. I said something pleasant to her, meaning no harm, an old-world compliment, what nice eyes you have, but she retreated in haste and the music stopped abruptly, and a violent-looking dark man, glistening with sweat, came out and glared at me. I was on the point of identifying myself when, with a pang of dream-embarrassment, I became aware of my mud-caked dungarees, my filthy and torn sweater, my bristly chin, my bum's bloodshot eyes. Without saying a word, I turned and plodded back the way I had come. An aster-like anemic flower grew out of a remembered chink in the sidewalk. Quietly resurrected, Miss Opposite was being wheeled out by her nieces, onto her porch, as if it were a stage and I the star performer. Praying she would not call to me, I hurried to my car. What a steep little street. What a profound avenue. A red ticket showed between wiper and windshield; I carefully tore it into two, four, eight pieces.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我该不该走进我的旧居？象屠格涅夫一部小说里写的，一首激烈的意大利钢琴曲从一扇敞开的窗子里涌出——是卧室的窗子：是什么浪漫的灵魂在这今人销魂的星期日，当阳光照耀在她可爱的腿上，在从未有钢琴淙淙作响的房中弹琴？忽然间，我发现，在我曾修剪过均草坪上，一个金色皮肤、棕色头发的性感少女，九岁或十岁，穿着白色短裤，正用她那充满野性魅力、深蓝色的大眼睛看着我。我说了句讨好的话，表示我没有恶意，一句老派的赞美辞，你有多么美丽的眼睛；但她却迟迟疑疑往后退去，音乐也戛然而止，而后一个面容黑粗、全身汗水淋漓的男人走出来，愤怒地瞪着我。我刚要解释，猛然间，一阵极度的窘迫袭来，我意识到我满是泥巴的祖布工作服，我肮脏破烂的毛农，我胡子拉茬的下巴，我叫化子一样充血的眼睛。一句话也没说，我扭转身，步履艰难地沿来路走回去。人行道上一条熟识的裂缝里长出了一株翠菊模样苍白的花。这时悄悄地，“对门”小姐又复活了，由她的两个侄女推到了门廊里，仿佛这是个舞台，而我是个名星演员。我飞快地奔向我的车，心里祷告她千万别叫我。那是怎样一条陡峭又窄小的街道，是怎样一条深远的长街。一张红色的罚款票夹在刮水器与挡风玻璃之间；我小心翼翼地把它撕成两片、四片、八片。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I rolled on. It was funny to see again the slender white church and the enormous elms. Forgetting that in an American suburban street a lone pedestrian is more conspicuous than a lone motorist, I left the car in the avenue to walk unobtrusively past 342 Lawn Street. Before the great bloodshed, I was entitled to a little relief, to a cathartic spasm of mental regurgitation. Closed were the white shutters of the Junk mansion, and somebody had attached a found black velvet hair ribbon to the white FOR SALE sign which was leaning toward the sidewalk. No dog barked. No gardener telephoned. No Miss Opposite sat on the vined porch -- where to the lone pedestrian's annoyance two pony-tailed young women in identical polka-dotted pinafores stopped doing whatever they were doing to stare at him: she was long dead, no doubt, these might be her twin nieces from Philadelphia.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我继续往前开。又看见那座白色教堂细长的顶尖和那片广阔茂盛的榆木林，真有意思。我忘记了，在美国郊区的街道上独自一人步行比独自一人开车更惹人眼目，竟把车扔在路上，谨慎地徒步走过草坪街342号。在伟大的流血事件发生之前，我有权放松一下自己，有权来一次精神反当的感情解放。琼克大愿已关上了它白色的窗板；朝向人行道的一个“此屋出售”的白色招牌上面，不知谁系了一条深黑色丝绒发带。没有狗在叫。没有园林工人在打电话。爬满藤枝的门廊里，也没有坐在那儿的“对门”小姐——而今孤独的步行人气恼的是两个梳马尾辫，系着同样圆点花纹围裙的年轻女子停下手里的活，直盯着他看：无疑她早就死了，这两个可能是从费城来的她的两个双胞胎侄女。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Feeling I was losing my time, I drove energetically to the downtown hotel where I had arrived with a new bag more than five years before. I took a room, made two appointments by telephone, shaved, bathed, put on black clothes and went down for a drink in the bar. Nothing had changed. The barroom was suffused with the same dim, impossible garnet-red light that in Europe years ago went with low haunts, but here meant a bit of atmosphere in a family hotel. I sat at the same little table where at the very start of my stay, immediately after becoming Charlotte's lodger, I had thought fit to celebrate the occasion by suavely sharing with her half a bottle of champagne, which had fatally conquered her poor brimming heart. As then, a moonfaced waiter was arranging with stellar care fifty sherries on a round tray for a wedding party. Murphy-Fantasia, this time. It was eight minutes to three. As I walked through the lobby, I had to skirt a group of ladies who with mille grâces were taking leave of each other after a luncheon party. With a harsh cry of recognition, one pounced upon me. She was a stout, short woman in pearl-gray, with a long, gray, slim plume to her small hat. It was Mrs. Chatfield. She attacked me with a fake smile, all aglow with evil curiosity. (Had I done to Dolly, perhaps, what Frank Lasalle, a fifty-year-old mechanic, had done to eleven-year-old Sally Horner in 1948?) Very soon I had that avid glee well under control. She thought I was in California. How was --? With exquisite pleasure I informed her that my stepdaughter had just married a brilliant young mining engineer with a hush-hush job in the Northwest. She said she disapproved of such early marriages, she would never let her Phyllis, who was now eighteen --</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我觉得我是在浪费时间，就又抖擞精神，往闹市区那家我五年以前曾提着一只新箱子去过的旅馆驶去。我定了一间房，用电话订了两个约会，刮了脸，洗了澡，穿上一身黑衣服，下楼到酒吧喝了点酒。一切如故。酒吧里仍旧弥漫着那深暗、压抑的石榴红色灯光；多年以前，这样的灯在欧洲就仅出现于低级旅馆里；不过这里是为制造一种融融的家庭气氛。我仍坐在那张小桌旁；从前，我刚做上夏洛特的房客时，曾想过，要温雅地与她共饮半瓶香槟以示庆祝；谁知这竟征服了她那凄楚可怜的心。一个圆脸盘的男侍者正在万分小心地将婚宴用的五十杯雪利酒摆在一个圆形托盘上面，这也还跟从前一样。这次演奏的是土豆幻想曲。差八分钟三点。过门厅时，我得绕过午饭聚餐后正千恩万谢彼此道别的一群夫人们。突然其中一个大叫了一声，认出了我，向我猛扑过来。她是个胖妇人，穿着银灰色的衣服，小帽上有一根细长的灰色羽饰。是查特菲尔德夫人。她面带假惺惺的微笑向我袭来，因怀着那恶的好奇心，面孔闪闪发亮（我是不是对多丽做了弗兰克。拉萨尔，一个五十岁的机器工，在一九四八年对十一岁的萨莉。霍纳做的事？）很快，我就把她那劲头十足的欢欣压了下去。她以为我在加利福尼亚。怎么会——？我特别欣慰地告诉她，我的继女刚刚嫁了一位聪明又年轻的采矿工程师，他在西北部做秘密工作。她说她不赞成早婚，她就决不会同意她的菲立斯，现在十八岁了——。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Now that everything had been put out of the way, I could dedicate myself freely to the main object of my visit to Ramsdale. In the methodical manner on which I have always prided myself, I had been keeping Clare Quilty's face masked in my dark dungeon, where he was waiting for me to come with barber and priest: "Réveillez-vous, Laqueue, il est temps de mourir!" I have no time right now to discuss the mnemonics of physiognomization -- I am on my way to his uncle and walking fast -- but let me jot down this: I had preserved in the alcohol of a clouded memory the toad of a face. In the course of a few glimpses, I had noticed its slight resemblance to a cheery and rather repulsive wine dealer, a relative of mine in Switzerland. With his dumbbells and stinking tricot, and fat hairy arms, and bald patch, and pig-faced servant-concubine, he was on the whole a harmless old rascal. Too harmless, in fact, to be confused with my prey. In the state of mind I now found myself, I had lost contact with Trapp's image. It had become completely engulfed by the face of Clare Quilty -- as represented, with artistic precision, by an easeled photograph of him that stood on his uncle's desk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="既然一切障碍都己消除，我就能够毫无顾忌地为我来拉姆斯代尔的主要目的而全力以赴。我一直以我为之骄傲的那种有条不紊将克莱尔。奎尔蒂的面孔掩蔽在我黑漆漆的城堡里，他在那儿等着我带理发师和牧师去：“醒来吧，你的死期已经到了！”我此时已没有时间讨论人相学的记忆法——我正在找他叔叔的路上大步如飞——但还是让我草草记下这一点：在我朦胧、晕沉沉的记忆里，保留着他的一张可恶的面孔。瞥了几眼，我发现它同一个乐呵呵、令人讨厌的酒商很象，他是我在瑞士的一个亲戚，手持哑铃，穿着有臭味的斜纹毛衣，肥胖的手臂上汗毛浓密，还有一小块秃顶；有一个长着一张猪脸、又做佣人又当情妇的小娘儿们路伴他。总之，他是个于人无害的老流氓。实际上，他是太无害了；与我的猎物不能混为一谈。这么想着，特拉普形象在我心中模糊了。它完全被克莱尔。奎尔蒂的面孔吞没了——那面孔是一张镶在相框里、摆在他叔叔桌上的照片，逼真极了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In Beardsley, at the hands of charming Dr. Molnar, I had undergone a rather serious dental operation, retaining only a few upper and lower front teeth. The substitutes were dependent on a system of plates with an inconspicuous wire affair running along my upper gums. The whole arrangement was a masterpiece of comfort, and my canines were in perfect health. However, to garnish my secret purpose with a plausible pretext, I told Dr. Quilty that, in hope of alleviating facial neuralgia, I had decided to have all my teeth removed. What would a complete set of dentures cost? How long would the process take, assuming we fixed our first appointment for some time in November? Where was his famous nephew now? Would it be possible to have them all out in one dramatic session?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在比尔兹利，医术高明的莫尔纳大夫曾给我做了一次牙科大手术，仅留下了我的几颗上牙和几颗下牙。换上的假牙依附于假牙托，后者又靠一根纤细的金属我固定在上牙床上。整个安排是一个杰作，我的虎牙仍完好无损。然而，为了掩饰我秘密的目的，找一个合理的托辞，我又对奎尔蒂大夫说，为了减轻面部神经痛，我决定把剩下的几颗牙也拔干净。一整副假牙得花多少钱？假定我们把第一次约会订在十一月某一天，手术得需要多长时间？他那名声很响的侄子现在哪儿？有可能戏剧性地一次就把它们统统拔光吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A white-smocked, gray-haired man, with a crew cut and the big flat cheeks of a politician, Dr. Quilty perched on the corner of his desk, one foot dreamily and seductively rocking as he launched on a glorious long-range plan. He would first provide me with provisional plates until the gums settled. Then he would make me a permanent set. He would like to have a look at that mouth of mine. He wore perforated pied shoes. He had not visited with the rascal since 1946, but supposed he could be found at his ancestral home, Grimm Road, not far from Parkington. It was a noble dream. His foot rocked, his gaze was inspired. It would cost me around six hundred. He suggested he take measurements right away, and make the first set before starting operations. My mouth was to him a splendid cave full of priceless treasures, but I denied him entrance.</div>
