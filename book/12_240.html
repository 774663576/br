<div class="line_en">"My very bones are chilled," said Gimli, flapping his arms and stamping his feet. Day had come at last. At dawn the companions had made such breakfast as they could; now in the growing light they were getting ready to search the ground again for signs of the hobbits.</div>

<div class="line_en">"That would not baffle a Ranger," said Gimli. "A bent blade is enough for Aragorn to read. But I do not expect him to find any traces. It was an evil phantom of Saruman that we saw last night. I am sure of it, even under the light of morning. His eyes are looking out on us from Fangorn even now, maybe."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这应该难不倒游侠的，”金雳说：“亚拉冈可以轻易地从弯倒的杂草中判读出线索来，不过，我也不期望他能够找到什么蛛丝马迹。我们昨天晚上看到的是萨鲁曼的影像。即使在大白天，我也敢这么说，或许他还正从法贡森林里瞪着我们呢！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"So I thought," said Aragorn; "but I cannot read the riddle, unless they return. Come! The light is growing fast. Let us look first and guess later! We should begin here, near to our own camping-ground, searching carefully all about, and working up the slope towards the forest. To find the hobbits is our errand, whatever we may think of our visitor in the night. If they escaped by some chance, then they must have hidden in the trees, or they would have been seen. If we find nothing between here and the eaves of the wood, then we will make a last search upon the battle-field and among the ashes. But there is little hope there: the horsemen of Rohan did their work too well."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我也是这么想！”亚拉冈说：“但除非它们回到我们身边来，否则我搞不清楚其中的谜团。来吧！天色已经很亮了，还是先看看到底发生了什么事情，稍后再来猜测吧！我们应该从营地附近往四下仔细搜寻，不要漏掉任何可能的线索，沿着斜坡往森林的方向找。不管我们对于昨晚的访客有什么看法，我们的任务还是找到那些哈比人；如果他们真的凑巧逃了出来，应该会躲在树林间，至少我们也可以看到一些线索。如果在这里和森林的前缘都找不到任何的痕迹，那么就必须在战场的焚灰之间找寻线索。但是，洛汗国的骠骑手段实在太俐落了，我们在那边恐怕找不到多少痕迹的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For some time the companions crawled and groped upon the ground. The tree stood mournfully above them, its dry leaves now hanging limp, and rattling in the chill easterly wind. Aragorn moved slowly away. He came to the ashes of the watch-fire near the river-bank, and then began to retrace the ground back towards the knoll where the battle had been fought. Suddenly he stooped and bent low with his face almost in the grass. Then he called to the others. They came running up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="三人在四周的地面仔细搜寻了一阵子，树木静静矗立着，仿佛也在为他们哀悼一般。亚拉冈慢慢地往外走，他来到了河岸边那些篝火的残迹旁，沿着地上的脚印走回战斗开始的地方。突然间，他停下脚步，脸几乎贴到草丛中。然后，他发出一声大喊，其它人连忙跑了过来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No," said Legolas. "I heard them clearly. But for the darkness and our own fear I should have guessed that they were beasts wild with some sudden gladness. They spoke as horses will when they meet a friend that they have long missed."</div>

<div class="line_en">"And here is the knife that cut them!" said Gimli. He stooped and drew out of a tussock, into which some heavy foot had trampled it, a short jagged blade. The haft from which it had been snapped was beside it. "It was an orc-weapon," he said, holding it gingerly, and looking with disgust at the carved handle: it had been shaped like a hideous head with squinting eyes and leering mouth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这是割断绳索的小刀！”金雳说。他弯下腰，从一丛曾经被践踏的草丛中，拿起一根短的锯齿刀刃，被踩断的刀柄就落在旁边。“这是半兽人的武器！”他小心翼翼地捏着刀柄，看着它弯曲的形状，面露恶心之色。刀柄的形状是一个丑恶的脑袋，脸上露出邪淫的笑容。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Here at last we find news!" said Aragorn. He lifted up a broken leaf for them to see, a large pale leaf of golden hue, now fading and turning brown. "Here is a mallorn-leaf of Lórien, and there are small crumbs on it, and a few more crumbs in the grass. And see! there are some pieces of cut cord lying nearby!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“终于，我们在这边找到了新的线索！”亚拉冈从地面上捡起一片破碎的叶子给大家看，那是个有着金色色泽的苍白叶片，已经开始缓缓地变成枯萎的褐色。“这是罗瑞安的树叶，上面还有一些干粮的碎屑，地面上也有一些。你们看！附近还有几段被切断的绳索！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, here is the strangest riddle that we have yet found!" exclaimed Legolas. "A bound prisoner escapes both from the Orcs and from the surrounding horsemen. He then stops, while still in the open, and cuts his bonds with an orc-knife. But how and why? For if his legs were tied, how did he walk? And if his arms were tied, how did he use the knife? And if neither were tied, why did he cut the cords at all? Being pleased with his skill, he then sat down and quietly ate some waybread! That at least is enough to show that he was a hobbit, without the mallorn-leaf. After that, I suppose, he turned his arms into wings and flew away singing into the trees. It should be easy to find him: we only need wings ourselves!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，这真是最大的谜团了！”勒苟拉斯抱怨道：“一个被绑住的俘虏，竟然从半兽人和骑士的包围圈中逃了出来；然后他在没有任何掩护的地方停了下来，利用半兽人的小刀割断绳索。可是他们是怎么办到的？如果他们的脚被绑住，要怎么走路呢？如果他的手被绑住，又要怎么使用小刀呢？如果他的手和脚都没有被绑，那他又为何割断绳索？就算他对于自己惊人的表现很满意，竟然又坐下来舒舒服服的吃干粮？光从这点，就算没有罗瑞安的树叶，我们也可以推断这家伙一定是哈比人。在那之后，我想他们应该就长出翅膀来，高高兴兴地飞进树林里面去了。要找到他应该很简单，我们只要也跟着长出翅膀就好了！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Maybe, I could," said Aragorn, smiling. "There are some other signs near at hand that you have not considered. I agree that the prisoner was a hobbit and must have had either legs or hands free, before he came here. I guess that it was hands, because the riddle then becomes easier, and also because, as I read the marks, he was carried to this point by an Orc. Blood was spilled there, a few paces away, orc-blood. There are deep prints of hoofs all about this spot, and signs that a heavy thing was dragged away. The Orc was slain by horsemen, and later his body was hauled to the fire. But the hobbit was not seen: he was not "in the open", for it was night and he still had his elven-cloak. He was exhausted and hungry, and it is not to be wondered at that, when he had cut his bonds with the knife of his fallen enemy, he rested and ate a little before he crept away. But it is a comfort to know that he had some lembas in his pocket, even though he ran away without gear or pack; that, perhaps, is like a hobbit. I say he, though I hope and guess that both Merry and Pippin were here together. There is, however, nothing to show that for certain."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“或许吧！”亚拉冈脸上挂着诡异的笑容：“手边还有一些细微的线索你们没有考虑到：我同意这名俘虏一定是哈比人，在他抵达这边之前，手或腿一定已经挣脱了束缚，我猜是他的手，因为这样让这个谜题变得比较容易，而且，从其它的线索看起来，他是被半兽人抱到这边来的。你们看，几步之外有血迹；那是半兽人的血迹。在这一带有很深的蹄印，又有重物被拖走的痕迹。这名半兽人是被骠骑杀死的，后来他的尸体又被拖去焚化。但他们并没有发现哈比人，他并非‘毫无掩护’，因为当时还是晚上，他又穿着精灵斗篷。他觉得又饿又累，因此，我们可以推测，在他利用死去敌人的小刀割断绳索之后，就顺便休息了一下，吃掉一些东西。不过，幸好，即使他逃跑的时候没有携带任何装备，身上至少还有一些兰巴斯，这种在口袋随身携带食物的习惯也是哈比人的特色之一。我虽然都是用他来描述，但我希望梅里和皮聘是一起行动的；很遗憾的，现场没有其它的线索可以支持我的这个想法。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I do not know how it happened," answered Aragorn. "Nor do I know why an Orc was carrying them away. Not to help them to escape, we may be sure. Nay, rather I think that I now begin to understand a matter that has puzzled me from the beginning: why when Boromir had fallen were the Orcs content with the capture of Merry and Pippin? They did not seek out the rest of us, nor attack our camp; but instead they went with all speed towards Isengard. Did they suppose they had captured the Ring-bearer and his faithful comrade? I think not. Their masters would not dare to give such plain orders to Orcs, even if they knew so much themselves; they would not speak openly to them of the Ring: they are not trusty servants. But I think the Orcs had been commanded to capture hobbits, alive, at all costs. An attempt was made to slip out with the precious prisoners before the battle. Treachery perhaps, likely enough with such folk; some large and bold Orc may have been trying to escape with the prize alone, for his own ends. There, that is my tale. Others might be devised. But on this we may count in any case: one at least of our friends escaped. It is our task to find him and help him before we return to Rohan. We must not be daunted by Fangorn, since need drove him into that dark place."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不知道那是怎么发生的，”亚拉冈回答：“同样的，我也不知道为什么会有半兽人要把他们抱走；我们可以合理的假设，他绝对不是想帮助他们逃跑。因为如此，我似乎明白了一个从开始就让我大惑不解的情况：为什么在波罗莫战死后，半兽人们甘于只抓走梅里和皮聘就好了？他们并没有试图找出我们，也没有攻击我们的营地；相反的，他们全速朝着艾辛格前进。他们是否有可能以为：自己已经俘虏了魔戒持有者和他忠实的仆人？恐怕不是。即使他们的主人知道真相，应该也不敢就这样把这机密说得这么清楚。他们绝不可能对属下公开提及魔戒，半兽人不是那么忠实的仆人；但我想，半兽人的命令应该是不计一切代价俘虏哈比人。在战斗开始前，有人试着想把俘虏偷带走，对于这些人来说，阵前叛变是家常便饭；某些强壮、大胆的半兽人或许想要独自带着这奖赏逃跑，获取利益。这就是我的推断，也许还有别的可能性，但我一时之间想不出来。我们可以确定一点：我们的朋友至少逃出了一名，现在的任务则是在回到洛汗之前找到他。我们不能够因法贡森林而退却，因为他一定被迫躲入了这座森林。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was not long before Aragorn found fresh signs. At one point, near the bank of the Entwash, he came upon footprints: hobbit-prints, but too light for much to be made of them. Then again beneath the bole of a great tree on the very edge of the wood more prints were discovered. The earth was bare and dry, and did not reveal much.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过不了多久，亚拉冈又找到新的线索，在靠近树沐河的地方，他找到了脚印；那些是哈比人的脚印，但对方的脚步太轻，无法确认有多少人。接着，他们又在森林边缘的一株大树旁找到了一些痕迹，但该处的泥土太硬了，找不到进一步的线索。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I do not think the wood feels evil, whatever tales may say," said Legolas. He stood under the eaves of the forest, stooping forward, as if he were listening, and peering with wide eyes into the shadows. "No, it is not evil; or what evil is in it is far away. I catch only the faintest echoes of dark places where the hearts of the trees are black. There is no malice near us; but there is watchfulness, and anger."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不管传说是怎么说的，我并不认为这座森林有邪恶的气息，”勒苟拉斯说。他站在森林的边缘，弯身向前，仿佛正在倾听着森林中的声响和游动的暗影。“不，这不是邪气，就算是，也距离我们很远。我只能依稀听到黑暗之处有着黑色树木的动静。我们附近没有任何的威胁，但我可以感觉到提防小心和愤怒的气息。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">With that the three hunters plunged into the forest of Fangorn. Legolas and Gimli left the tracking to Aragorn. There was little for him to see. The floor of the forest was dry and covered with a drift of leaves; but guessing that the fugitives would stay near the water, he returned often to the banks of the stream. So it was that he came upon the place where Merry and Pippin had drunk and bathed their feet. There plain for all to see were the footprints of two hobbits, one somewhat smaller than the other.</div>

<div class="line_en">"What then shall I say?" said Gandalf, and paused for a while in thought. "This in brief is how I see things at the moment, if you wish to have a piece of my mind as plain as possible. The Enemy, of course, has long known that the Ring is abroad, and that it is borne by a hobbit. He knows now the number of our Company that set out from Rivendell, and the kind of each of us. But he does not yet perceive our purpose clearly. He supposes that we were all going to Minas Tirith; for that is what he would himself have done in our place. And according to his wisdom it would have been a heavy stroke against his power. Indeed he is in great fear, not knowing what mighty one may suddenly appear, wielding the Ring, and assailing him with war, seeking to cast him down and take his place. That we should wish to cast him down and have no one in his place is not a thought that occurs to his mind. That we should try to destroy the Ring itself has not yet entered into his darkest dream. In which no doubt you will see our good fortune and our hope. For imagining war he has let loose war, believing that he has no time to waste; for he that strikes the first blow, if he strikes it hard enough, may need to strike no more. So the forces that he has long been preparing he is now setting in motion, sooner than he intended. Wise fool. For if he had used all his power to guard Mordor, so that none could enter, and bent all his guile to the hunting of the Ring, then indeed hope would have faded: neither Ring nor bearer could long have eluded him. But now his eye gazes abroad rather than near at home; and mostly he looks towards Minas Tirith. Very soon now his strength will fall upon it like a storm."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我又该说些什么？”甘道夫暂停片刻，思索着：“如果你想要知道我到底在想什么，我只能说，刚刚所讲的都是我对于目前局势的看法。当然，魔王也早就知道魔戒已经离开了夏尔，而它目前的持有者是一名哈比人。他现在也知道离开瑞文戴尔的远征队人数，以及每个人的种族，但是，他依旧还不确定我们的目的和用意。他推测我们都会前往米那斯提力斯，因为如果是他，他也会这么做。根据他的思考模式，我们这样的计划会对他造成极为沉重的打击。他目前正惶惶不可终日，不知道会有哪个掌握权柄的伟人出现，拿着魔戒挑战他、以战争推翻他，取代他的地位。他根本没想过我们只想推翻他，不想找人取而代之；我们竟然想摧毁魔戒的这个计划，也根本从未出现在他最黑暗的噩梦中。毫无疑问的，你也看得出来我们的幸运和希望之所在。由于他幻想中的战争，他被迫仓促掀起战争，认为自己必须要把握时机。他相信如果是自己先发制人，只要伤害够大，或许可以不用发动接下来的攻击，因此，他为最终战争所准备的兵力，必须比计划中更早开始行动。真是聪明反被聪明误！如果他把所有的力量用来守卫魔多，倾全力搜寻魔戒，那我们才真正只能臣服于他；不管我们使用什么样的方法，最后魔戒和持有者都无法躲过他的搜寻。幸好，他的目光在世界各地犹疑，却没有注意到自己的家门，大部分的时间都花在米那斯提力斯之上。不久之后，他就会发动全部的兵力攻打该处。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Indeed yes," said Gandalf. "Doubly. And is not that strange? Nothing that we have endured of late has seemed so grievous as the treason of Isengard. Even reckoned as a lord and captain Saruman has grown very strong. He threatens the Men of Rohan and draws off their help from Minas Tirith, even as the main blow is approaching from the East. Yet a treacherous weapon is ever a danger to the hand. Saruman also had a mind to capture the Ring, for himself, or at least to snare some hobbits for his evil purposes. So between them our enemies have contrived only to bring Merry and Pippin with marvellous speed, and in the nick of time, to Fangorn, where otherwise they would never have come at all!"</div>

That he will never do now. He does not yet know his peril. There is much that he does not know. He was so eager to lay his hands on his prey that he could not wait at home, and he came forth to meet and to spy on his messengers. But he came too late, for once, and the battle was over and beyond his help before he reached these parts. He did not remain here long. I look into his mind and I see his doubt. He has no woodcraft. He believes that the horsemen slew and burned all upon the field of battle; but he does not know whether the Orcs were bringing any prisoners or not. And he does not know of the quarrel between his servants and the Orcs of Mordor; nor does he know of the Winged Messenger."</div>

But they have not yet been allowed to cross the River, and Saruman does not know of this new shape in which the Ringwraiths have been clad. His thought is ever on the Ring. Was it present in the battle? Was it found? What if Théoden, Lord of the Mark, should come by it and learn of its power? That is the danger that he sees, and he has fled back to Isengard to double and treble his assault on Rohan.

I hope indeed, Legolas, that you may yet meet him. Merry and Pippin have been fortunate: they met him here, even where we sit. For he came here two days ago and bore them away to his dwelling far off by the roots of the mountains. He often comes here, especially when his mind is uneasy, and rumours of the world outside trouble him. I saw him four days ago striding among the trees, and I think he saw me, for he paused; but I did not speak, for I was heavy with thought, and weary after my struggle with the Eye of Mordor; and he did not speak either, nor call my name."</div>

Certainly the forest of Fangorn is perilous -- not least to those that are too ready with their axes; and Fangorn himself, he is perilous too; yet he is wise and kindly nonetheless.

There was none to see, or perhaps in after ages songs would still be sung of the Battle of the Peak." Suddenly Gandalf laughed. "But what would they say in song? Those that looked up from afar thought that the mountain was crowned with storm. Thunder they heard, and lightning, they said, smote upon Celebdil, and leaped back broken into tongues of fire. Is not that enough? A great smoke rose about us, vapour and steam. Ice fell like rain.

<div class="line_en">"Now I understand a part of last night's riddle," said Legolas as he sprang lightly upon Arod's back. "Whether they fled at first in fear, or not, our horses met Shadowfax, their chieftain, and greeted him with joy. Did you know that he was at hand, Gandalf?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我这才明白昨晚是怎么一回事，”勒苟拉斯身轻如燕地跃上阿罗德的背：“不管它们一开始是不是因为恐惧而逃跑，最后它们都遇到了族长影疾，因此高兴地和它会合。甘道夫，你知道它就徘徊在附近吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, I knew," said the wizard. "I bent my thought upon him, bidding him to make haste; for yesterday he was far away in the south of this land. Swiftly may he bear me back again!"</div>

<div class="line_en">"He is steering a straight course now for the halls of Théoden under the slopes of the White Mountains," said Gandalf. "It will be quicker so. The ground is firmer in the Eastemnet, where the chief northward track lies, across the river, but Shadowfax knows the way through every fen and hollow."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“它正朝着希优顿在白色山脉下的皇宫前进，”甘道夫说：“这样子会比较快。东洛汗的道路比较明显，主要的大路在河的另一边，但影疾知道这块土地上的每一条捷径。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For many hours they rode on through the meads and riverlands. Often the grass was so high that it reached above the knees of the riders, and their steeds seemed to be swimming in a grey-green sea. They came upon many hidden pools, and broad acres of sedge waving above wet and treacherous bogs; but Shadowfax found the way, and the other horses followed in his swath. Slowly the sun fell from the sky down into the West. Looking out over the great plain, far away the riders saw it for a moment like a red fire sinking into the grass. Low upon the edge of sight shoulders of the mountains glinted red upon either side. A smoke seemed to rise up and darken the sun's disc to the hue of blood, as if it had kindled the grass as it passed down under the rim of earth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接下来的许多个小时，他们都在草原和河谷间奔驰着。绿草的高度有时甚至达到骑士的膝盖，众人的座骑似乎泅泳于绿色的大海中。他们一路上遇到许多泥塘，甚至包括潮湿危险的沼泽，但影疾都带领众人安全通过。慢慢的，太阳开始往西方落下，看着这块辽阔的平原，骑士们目睹太阳如同烈火一般落入地平线的另一端。在远方的山脉两边都有着红色的光芒，一道黑烟将落日掩盖了部分，把夕阳化成了血色的黄昏。">查看中文翻译</div>
