<div class="line_en">Josiah, my father, married young, and carried his wife with three children into New England, about 1682. The conventicles having been forbidden by law, and frequently disturbed, induced some considerable men of his acquaintance to remove to that country, and he was prevailed with to accompany them thither, where they expected to enjoy their mode of religion with freedom. By the same wife he had four children more born there, and by a second wife ten more, in all seventeen; of which I remember thirteen sitting at one time at his table, who all grew up to be men and women, and married; I was the youngest son, and the youngest child but two, and was born in Boston, New England. My mother, the second wife, was Abiah Folger, daughter of Peter Folger, one of the first settlers of New England, of whom honorable mention is made by Cotton Mather in his church history of that country, entitled Magnalia Christi Americana, as 'a godly, learned Englishman," if I remember the words rightly. I have heard that he wrote sundry small occasional pieces, but only one of them was printed, which I saw now many years since. It was written in 1675, in the home-spun verse of that time and people, and addressed to those then concerned in the government there. It was in favor of liberty of conscience, and in behalf of the Baptists, uakers, and other sectaries that had been under persecution, ascribing the Indian wars, and other distresses that had befallen the country, to that persecution, as so many judgments of God to punish so heinous an offense, and exhorting a repeal of those uncharitable laws. The whole appeared to me as written with a good deal of decent plainness and manly freedom. The six concluding lines I remember, though I have forgotten the two first of the stanza; but the purport of them was, that his censures proceeded from good-will, and, therefore, he would be known to be the author.</div>

<div class="line_en">My elder brothers were all put apprentices to different trades. I was put to the grammar-school at eight years of age, my father intending to devote me, as the tithe of his sons, to the service of the Church. My early readiness in learning to read (which must have been very early, as I do not remember when I could not read), and the opinion of all his friends, that I should certainly make a good scholar, encouraged him in this purpose of his. My uncle Benjamin, too, approved of it, and proposed to give me all his short-hand volumes of sermons, I suppose as a stock to set up with, if I would learn his character. I continued, however, at the grammar-school not quite one year, though in that time I had risen gradually from the middle of the class of that year to be the head of it, and farther was removed into the next class above it, in order to go with that into the third at the end of the year. But my father, in the meantime, from a view of the expense of a college education, which having so large a family he could not well afford, and the mean living many so educated were afterwards able to obtain-reasons that be gave to his friends in my hearing -- altered his first intention, took me from the grammar-school, and sent me to a school for writing and arithmetic, kept by a then famous man, Mr. George Brownell, very successful in his profession generally, and that by mild, encouraging methods. Under him I acquired fair writing pretty soon, but I failed in the arithmetic, and made no progress in it. At ten years old I was taken home to assist my father in his business, which was that of a tallow-chandler and sope-boiler; a business he was not bred to, but had assumed on his arrival in New England, and on finding his dying trade would not maintain his family, being in little request.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我的哥哥们都拜师学了各种不同的行业。我父亲打算把我当作儿子中的什一税捐奉献给教会，所以在八岁上就把我送到语法学校去念书。我早年读书颖悟（我一定很早就识字，因为我记不起我曾经有过不识字的时期），他的朋友们又都说我将来读书一定很有成就，这一切都鼓励了我父亲把我送到学校去念书。我伯父本杰明也赞成我念书，并且提议把他全部说教的速记本赠送给我（我想大概是作为开业的资本罢），如果我肯学习他的速记术的话。但是我在语法学校里念了不到一年，虽然在这一年中我逐步地从该班的中等生升到全班的优等生，接着就升入了二年级，好让我在那年年终随班升入三年级。但是这时候我父亲因为家庭人口多，负担不起大学求学的费用，同时他看到许多受过大学教育的人日后穷困潦倒（这是他在我面前对他的朋友们讲的），他改变了他原先的主张，叫我离开语法学校，把我送到一所书算学校去。这所学校是当时著名的乔治·布朗纳先生主持的，一般说来他办学很有成绩，并且能够循循善诱，春风化雨。在他的教导之下，我很快地学会了一手清晰的书法，但是算术我考不及格，并且毫无进步。在十岁上我父亲把我接回家来，帮助他营业。他经营的是油烛和肥皂制造业。这原不是他的本行，但是到了新英格兰，他发现染色业生意清淡，不能维持一家的生活。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a salt-marsh that bounded part of the mill-pond, on the edge of which, at high water, we used to stand to fish for minnows. By much trampling, we had made it a mere quagmire. My proposal was to build a wharff there fit for us to stand upon, and I showed my comrades a large heap of stones, which were intended for a new house near the marsh, and which would very well suit our purpose. Accordingly, in the evening, when the workmen were gone, I assembled a number of my play-fellows, and working with them diligently like so many emmets, sometimes two or three to a stone, we brought them all away and built our little wharff. The next morning the workmen were surprised at missing the stones, which were found in our wharff. Inquiry was made after the removers; we were discovered and complained of; several of us were corrected by our fathers; and though I pleaded the usefulness of the work, mine convinced me that nothing was useful which was not honest.</div>

<div class="line_en">I think you may like to know something of his person and character. He had an excellent constitution of body, was of middle stature, but well set, and very strong; he was ingenious, could draw prettily, was skilled a little in music, and had a clear pleasing voice, so that when he played psalm tunes on his violin and sung withal, as he sometimesdid in an evening after the business of the day was over, it was extremely agreeable to hear. He had a mechanical genius too, and, on occasion, was very handy in the use of other tradesmen's tools; but his great excellence lay in a sound understanding and solid judgment in prudential matters, both in private and publick affairs. In the latter, indeed, he was never employed, the numerous family he had to educate and the straitness of his circumstances keeping him close to his trade; but I remember well his being frequently visited by leading people, who consulted him for his opinion in affairs of the town or of the church he belonged to, and showed a good deal of respect for his judgment and advice: he was also much consulted by private persons about their affairs when any difficulty occurred, and frequently chosen an arbitrator between contending parties.</div>

<div class="line_en">At his table he liked to have, as often as he could, some sensible friend or neighbor to converse with, and always took care to start some ingenious or useful topic for discourse, which might tend to improve the minds of his children. By this means he turned our attention to what was good, just, and prudent in the conduct of life; and little or no notice was ever taken of what related to the victuals on the table, whether it was well or ill dressed, in or out of season, of good or bad flavor, referable or inferior to this or that other thing of the kind, so that I was bro't up in such a perfect inattention to those matters as to be quite indifferent what kind of food was set before me, and so unobservant of it, that to this day if I am asked I can scarce tell a few hours after dinner what I dined upon. This has been a convenience to me in travelling, where my companions have been sometimes very unhappy for want of a suitable gratification of their more delicate, because better instructed, tastes and appetites.</div>

<div class="line_en">But my dislike to the trade continuing, my father was under apprehensions that if he did not find one for me more agreeable, I should break away and get to sea, as his son Josiah had done, to his great vexation. He therefore sometimes took me to walk with him, and see joiners, bricklayers, turners, braziers, etc., at their work, that he might observe my inclination, and endeavor to fix it on some trade or other on land. It has ever since been a pleasure to me to see good workmen handle their tools; and it has been useful to me, having learnt so much by it as to be able to do little jobs myself in my house when a workman could not readily be got, and to construct little machines for my experiments, while the intention of making the experiment was fresh and warm in my mind. My father at last fixed upon the cutler's trade, and my uncle Benjamin's son Samuel, who was bred to that business in London, being about that time established in Boston, I was sent to be with him some time on liking.

<div class="line_en">From a child I was fond of reading, and all the little money that came into my hands was ever laid out in books. Pleased with the Pilgrim's Progress, my first collection was of John Bunyan's works in separate little volumes. I afterward sold them to enable me to buy R. Burton's Historical Collections; they were small chapmen's books, and cheap, 40 or 50 in all. My father's little library consisted chiefly of books in polemic divinity, most of which I read, and have since often regretted that, at a time when I had such a thirst for knowledge, more proper books had not fallen in my way since it was now resolved I should not be a clergyman.</div>

<div class="line_en">And after some time an ingenious tradesman, Mr. Matthew Adams, who had a pretty collection of books, and who frequented our printing-house, took notice of me, invited me to his library, and very kindly lent me such books as I chose to read. I now took a fancy to poetry, and made some little pieces; my brother, thinking it might turn to account, encouraged me, and put me on composing occasional ballads. One was called The Lighthouse Tragedy, and contained an account of the drowning of Captain Worthilake, with his two daughters: the other was a sailor's song, on the taking of Teach (or Blackbeard) the pirate. They were wretched stuff, in the Grub-street-ballad style; and when they were printed he sent me about the town to sell them. The first sold wonderfully, the event being recent, having made a great noise. This flattered my vanity; but my father discouraged me by ridiculing my performances, and telling me verse-makers were generally beggars. So I escaped being a poet, most probably a very bad one; but as prose writing bad been of great use to me in the course of my life, and was a principal means of my advancement, I shall tell you how, in such a situation, I acquired what little ability I have in that way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过了一些时候，有一个很聪明的商人，名叫马太·亚当先生，经常到我们的印刷铺里来。他家藏书颇多，他注意到了我，邀我到他的藏书室里去，欣然借给我一些我要读的书籍，这时我爱上了诗歌，写了几首小诗。我哥哥认为写诗可能以后有用，所以鼓励我并且命我编写两首应时故事诗。一首叫做《灯塔悲剧》，叙述华萨雷船长和他的两个女儿溺毙的故事。另一首是水手歌，叙述捉拿海盗铁契（或叫做“黑胡子”）的经过。这两首都是毫无价值的东西，是用低级小调的格式写成的。印好了以后，我哥哥叫我到镇上各处去叫卖。第一首销路很好，因为它所叙述的是新近发生的、曾经轰动一时的事件。这事使我沾沾自喜；但是我父亲却反对，他嘲笑我的诗歌，他说诗人一般都是穷光蛋。这样我幸免成为一个诗人，很可能成为一个十分低劣的诗人，但是由于在我一生中散文的写作对我十分有用，而且是我发迹的一种主要手段，因此我将告诉你，在这种情况下，我是如何在这一方面获得我现有的一点小小才能的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">To prevent the apprehended effect of such an inclination, my father was impatient to have me bound to my brother. I stood out some time, but at last was persuaded, and signed the indentures when I was yet but twelve years old. I was to serve as an apprentice till I was twenty-one years of age, only I was to be allowed journeyman's wages during the last year. In a little time I made great proficiency in the business, and became a useful hand to my brother. I now had access to better books. An acquaintance with the apprentices of booksellers enabled me sometimes to borrow a small one, which I was careful to return soon and clean. Often I sat up in my room reading the greatest part of the night, when the book was borrowed in the evening and to be returned early in the morning, lest it should be missed or wanted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="为了预防这种渴望产生忧惧的后果，我父亲急欲叫我跟我哥哥学徒。我反对了一些时候，但是最后我同意了，签订了师徒合同，当时我只有十二岁。按照合同，我将充当学徒直到我二十一岁时为止，但在最后一年中我将按照合同获得出师职工的工资。在很短的时期内，我熟悉了印刷业，成为我哥哥的得力助手。这时我有机会阅读较好的书籍了。我跟一些书铺的学徒们打交道，这种相识有时使我能够从他们那里借到一本小书，但是我很小心，很快地交还给他们，并且保持书本的整洁。有时候在晚间借到一本书，为了怕被人发现缺书或是怕有人要买这本书，第二天一清早即须归还，因此我常常坐在房间阅读到深夜。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A question was once, somehow or other, started between Collins and me, of the propriety of educating the female sex in learning, and their abilities for study. He was of opinion that it was improper, and that they were naturally unequal to it. I took the contrary side, perhaps a little for dispute's sake.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不知怎样高令斯和我开始辩论起妇女应否受高深教育和妇女有否从事研究工作能力的问题。他认为妇女不应受高深的教育，她们的天赋低劣，不能胜任。我站在另一面，也许有点儿仅仅是为了争辩而争辩罢了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was another bookish lad in the town, John Collins by name, with whom I was intimately acquainted. We sometimes disputed, and very fond we were of argument, and very desirous of confuting one another, which disputatious turn, by the way, is apt to become a very bad habit, making people often extremely disagreeable in company by the contradiction that is necessary to bring it into practice; and thence, besides souring and spoiling the conversation, is productive of disgusts and, perhaps enmities where you may have occasion for friendship. I had caught it by reading my father's books of dispute about religion. Persons of good sense, I have since observed, seldom fall into it, except lawyers, university men, and men of all sorts that have been bred at Edinborough.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在镇上另外有一个爱好读书的孩子，叫做约翰·高令斯，我和他往来甚密，有时我们有争论，我们的确十分爱好争辩，很想驳倒对方。这种爱争辩的癖好，让我顺便说一说，很容易发展成为一种很坏的习惯。为了争辩人们必须提出反对的意见，这种抗辩常常使人在他人面前变成十分讨厌。因此，它不但使人们的交谈变成别扭和遭到破坏，并且会产生厌恶，甚至使本来可能发生融洽友情的场合产生了敌意。我这种爱好争辩的习气是从阅读我父亲的那些有关宗教论辩的书籍中得来的。从那时起我发现，除了律师、大学生以及在爱丁堡受过训练的各式各样的人以外，明达的人很少染上这种习气的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He answered, and I replied. Three or four letters of a side had passed, when my father happened to find my papers and read them. Without entering into the discussion, he took occasion to talk to me about the manner of my writing; observed that, though I had the advantage of my antagonist in correct spelling and pointing (which I ow'd to the printing-house), I fell far short in elegance of expression, in method and in perspicuity, of which he convinced me by several instances. I saw the justice of his remark, and thence grew more attentive to the manner in writing, and determined to endeavor at improvement.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他回信，我又答辩，这样双方交换了三四次信件。碰巧这时我父亲看见了我的信札，读了一遍，他虽不参加我们的论战，但是他趁机和我讨论我的文章体裁问题，他说：虽然在正字和标点方面我胜过我的论敌（这点得归功于印刷所），但在措辞的典雅、叙述的条理清晰方面我远不如对方，他并举了几个实例来使我信服。我看出了他的话是公平合理的，所以从此以后更注意文章的风格，决心力求改进。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was naturally more eloquent, had a ready plenty of words; and sometimes, as I thought, bore me down more by his fluency than by the strength of his reasons. As we parted without settling the point, and were not to see one another again for some time, I sat down to put my arguments in writing, which I copied fair and sent to him.</div>

<div class="line_en">About this time I met with an odd volume of the Spectator. It was the third. I had never before seen any of them. I bought it, read it over and over, and was much delighted with it. I thought the writing excellent, and wished, if possible, to imitate it. With this view I took some of the papers, and, making short hints of the sentiment in each sentence, laid them by a few days, and then, without looking at the book, try'd to compleat the papers again, by expressing each hinted sentiment at length, and as fully as it had been expressed before, in any suitable words that should come to hand. Then I compared my Spectator with the original, discovered some of my faults, and corrected them. But I found I wanted a stock of words, or a readiness in recollecting and using them, which I thought I should have acquired before that time if I had gone on making verses; since the continual occasion for words of the same import, but of different length, to suit the measure, or of different sound for the rhyme, would have laid me under a constant necessity of searching for variety, and also have tended to fix that variety in my mind, and make me master of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大约在这时候，我偶然看到了一本《旁观者》的零本，是第三册，在这以前，我从未曾看见过这个刊物。我买了这本散册，反复读了几遍，十分中意，我认为文章写得好极了，如果可能的话，我想模仿它的风格。因此我拿了几篇论文把每一句的思想作一个简单的摘要，接着把它搁置几天，然后不看原书，用我自己想得起来的合适辞句，把每一点摘录下来的思想用完整的句子表达出来，又凑成整篇的论文，使它表达得像以前一样地完整。然后我把我的《旁观者》与原来的比较，发现一些我的缺点，作了修正。但是我发现我的词汇贫乏，或是说我不能很快地想起适当的词来用，我想假如我以前没有放弃写诗的话，到那时候我的词汇一定会丰富得多了，因为经常不断地有机会寻找具有同样意义而有不同长度的词去适合诗的韵律，或是不同音素的词去凑韵脚，会迫使我不断地搜索具有不同形式的同义词，会有助于我记忆这些不同的词并使我掌握它们。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Therefore I took some of the tales and turned them into verse; and, after a time, when I had pretty well forgotten the prose, turned them back again. I also sometimes jumbled my collections of hints into confusion, and after some weeks endeavored to reduce them into the best order, before I began to form the full sentences and compleat the paper. This was to teach me method in the arrangement of thoughts. By comparing my work afterwards with the original, I discovered many faults and amended them; but I sometimes had the pleasure of fancying that, in certain particulars of small import, I had been lucky enough to improve the method or the language, and this encouraged me to think I might possibly in time come to be a tolerable English writer, of which I was extremely ambitious. My time for these exercises and for reading was at night, after work or before it began in the morning, or on Sundays, when I contrived to be in the printing-house alone, evading as much as I could the common attendance on public worship which my father used to exact on me when I was under his care, and which indeed I still thought a duty, though I could not, as it seemed to me, afford time to practise it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因此，我把其中的一些故事改写成了诗，过一些时候，当我差不多已经遗忘了原来的散文的时候，我又把它们重新还原。有时候我也把我摘录的思想搞乱了，经过几个星期以后，设法把它们用最好的次序排列起来，然后再把它们写成完整的句子，拼成论文。这样做是为了教我如何排列思想的方法，在复原后与原文比较时，我发现了许多缺点，就加以改正。但是有时候我喜欢幻想：在某些次要的地方我侥幸改进原文的条理和语言，这种幻想鼓励了我，使我相信在将来我或许可能成为一个不十分坏的英文作家，在这方面，我原是颇有奢望的。我阅读书籍和做这类练习的时间是在晚间工作完毕后或是早晨工作开始以前，或是在星期日。在星期日尽管我父亲在我还是在他管教之下的时候惯常逼我去做礼拜，尽管我当时确实还认为做礼拜是我们应尽的义务（虽然我好像无暇参加礼拜），我总是尽可能地躲避参加这种普遍遵守的崇拜仪式，设法独自一人留在印刷所里。">查看中文翻译</div>
