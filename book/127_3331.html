<div class="line_en">Once on a dark winter's day, when the yellow fog hung so thick and heavy in the streets of London that the lamps were lighted and the shop windows blazed with gas as they do at night, an odd-looking little girl sat in a cab with her father and was driven rather slowly through the big thoroughfares.</div>

<div class="line_en">She was such a little girl that one did not expect to see such a look on her small face. It would have been an old look for a child of twelve, and Sara Crewe was only seven. The fact was, however, that she was always dreaming and thinking odd things and could not herself remember any time when she had not been thinking things about grown-up people and the world they belonged to. She felt as if she had lived a long, long time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她年纪还小，人们料想不到能在她的小脸上看到这样的眼神。即使对一个十二岁的孩子说来，这样的眼神也显得老气横秋，何况萨拉·克鲁仅仅只有七岁！可是，事实上她总是在梦幻着、思考着一些古怪的事情，她自己也不知道有什么时候不在想关于成人们的事情和他们所属的那个世界。她觉得好像已经活得很久很久了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At this moment she was remembering the voyage she had just made from Bombay with her father, Captain Crewe. She was thinking of the big ship, of the Lascars passing silently to and fro on it, of the children playing about on the hot deck, and of some young officers' wives who used to try to make her talk to them and laugh at the things she said.</div>

<div class="line_en">Principally, she was thinking of what a queer thing it was that at one time one was in India in the blazing sun, and then in the middle of the ocean, and then driving in a strange vehicle through strange streets where the day was as dark as the night. She found this so puzzling that she moved closer to her father.</div>

<div class="line_en">It seemed to her many years since he had begun to prepare her mind for "the place," as she always called it. Her mother had died when she was born, so she had never known or missed her. Her young, handsome, rich, petting father seemed to be the only relation she had in the world. They had always played together and been fond of each other. She only knew he was rich because she had heard people say so when they thought she was not listening, and she had also heard them say that when she grew up she would be rich, too. She did not know all that being rich meant. She had always lived in a beautiful bungalow, and had been used to seeing many servants who made salaams to her and called her "Missee Sahib," and gave her her own way in everything. She had had toys and pets and an ayah who worshipped her, and she had gradually learned that people who were rich had these things. That, however, was all she knew about it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她觉得父亲让她在思想上“那地”（她总是这样称呼那个将来要去的地方）有所准备以来，好像已有好多年了。萨拉一生下来母亲就死了，所以她一点也不知道妈妈是什么样子，也不想念她。她那年轻、英俊、富裕、亲昵的父亲似乎是这世界上唯一的亲人。他们常常一起游玩，彼此感情深厚。她所以知道他很富裕，是因为听人们这样说过，当时他们还以为她没在听，她还听到他们说，将来她长大后也会是个富人。她并不知道作为富人的全部含义― 直住在一座漂亮的有凉台的平房内，惯于看到那许多仆人向她行额手礼，称呼“小姐，您”，并且凡事都由着她的性子。她有玩具与小宠物，还有一个崇拜她的印度保姆，于是她渐渐地明白了，富人们才拥有这些东西。不过，她所知道的也仅此而已。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">During her short life only one thing had troubled her, and that thing was "the place" she was to be taken to some day. The climate of India was very bad for children, and as soon as possible they were sent away from it -- generally to England and to school. She had seen other children go away, and had heard their fathers and mothers talk about the letters they received from them. She had known that she would be obliged to go also, and though sometimes her father's stories of the voyage and the new country had attracted her, she had been troubled by the thought that he could not stay with her.</div>

<div class="line_en">She had liked to think of that. To keep the house for her father; to ride with him, and sit at the head of his table when he had dinner parties; to talk to him and read his books -- that would be what she would like most in the world, and if one must go away to "the place" in England to attain it, she must make up her mind to go. She did not care very much for other little girls, but if she had plenty of books she could console herself. She liked books more than anything else, and was, in fact, always inventing stories of beautiful things and telling them to herself. Sometimes she had told them to her father, and he had liked them as much as she did.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她喜欢那样想：终有一天她能够替爸爸管家，和他一起驾车出去，设晚宴时坐在他餐桌的首席，和他谈话，读他的书― 这将是世界上她最爱干的事，如果说必须离开此地到英格兰“那地”去了才能如愿以偿，她一定下决心去。她不很在意是否有其他女孩作伴，只要有很多书便能自得其乐了。她爱书胜于其他，实际上她总是在编造美丽的故事，自讲自听，有时也讲给父亲听，他和她一样喜欢这些故事。">查看中文翻译</div>

His quaint little Sara had been a great companion to him, and he felt he should be a lonely fellow when, on his return to India, he went into his bungalow knowing he need not expect to see the small figure in its white frock come forward to meet him. So he held her very closely in his arms as the cab rolled into the big, dull square in which stood the house which was their destination.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Here we are, Sara," said Captain Crewe, making his voice sound as cheerful as possible. Then he lifted her out of the cab and they mounted the steps and rang the bell. Sara often thought afterward that the house was somehow exactly like Miss Minchin. It was respectable and well furnished, but everything in it was ugly; and the very armchairs seemed to have hard bones in them. In the hall everything was hard and polished -- even the red cheeks of the moon face on the tall clock in the corner had a severe varnished look. The drawing room into which they were ushered was covered by a carpet with a square pattern upon it, the chairs were square, and a heavy marble timepiece stood upon the heavy marble mantel.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was just then that Miss Minchin entered the room. She was very like her house, Sara felt: tall and dull, and respectable and ugly.

She was not in the least like Isobel Grange, who had been the beauty of the regiment, but she had an odd charm of her own.

Her hair was heavy and quite black and only curled at the tips; her eyes were greenish gray, it is true, but they were big, wonderful eyes with long, black lashes, and though she herself did not like the color of them, many other people did. Still she was very firm in her belief that she was an ugly little girl, and she was not at all elated by Miss Minchin's flattery.</div>

She had been brought to the seminary because Lady Meredith's two little girls had been educated there, and Captain Crewe had a great respect for Lady Meredith's experience. Sara was to be what was known as "a parlor boarder," and she was to enjoy even greater privileges than parlor boarders usually did.

She doesn't read them, Miss Minchin; she gobbles them up as if she were a little wolf instead of a little girl. She is always starving for new books to gobble, and she wants grown-up books -- great, big, fat ones -- French and German as well as English -- history and biography and poets, and all sorts of things. Drag her away from her books when she reads too much. Make her ride her pony in the Row or go out and buy a new doll. She ought to play more with dolls."</div>

<div class="line_en">Sara stayed with her father at his hotel for several days; in fact, she remained with him until he sailed away again to India. They went out and visited many big shops together, and bought a great many things. They bought, indeed, a great many more things than Sara needed; but Captain Crewe was a rash, innocent young man and wanted his little girl to have everything she admired and everything he admired himself, so between them they collected a wardrobe much too grand for a child of seven. There were velvet dresses trimmed with costly furs, and lace dresses, and embroidered ones, and hats with great, soft ostrich feathers, and ermine coats and muffs, and boxes of tiny gloves and handkerchiefs and silk stockings in such abundant supplies that the polite young women behind the counters whispered to each other that the odd little girl with the big, solemn eyes must be at least some foreign princess -- perhaps the little daughter of an Indian rajah.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I want her to look as if she wasn't a doll really," Sara said. "I want her to look as if she LISTENS when I talk to her. The trouble with dolls, papa" -- and she put her head on one side and reflected as she said it -- "the trouble with dolls is that they never seem to HEAR." So they looked at big ones and little ones -- at dolls with black eyes and dolls with blue -- at dolls with brown curls and dolls with golden braids, dolls dressed and dolls undressed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我要她看上去好像并不是个洋娃娃”萨拉说“我要她看上去好像正在倾听我对她说话。洋娃娃的缺点，爸爸”她歪着头沉思着说“洋娃娃的缺点是她们似乎从来都不会听”于是父女俩看了大大小小许多洋娃娃，黑眼睛的、蓝眼睛的、棕色容发的、梳金色辫子的、穿衣服的和不穿衣服的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You see," Sara said when they were examining one who had no clothes. "If, when I find her, she has no frocks, we can take her to a dressmaker and have her things made to fit. They will fit better if they are tried on."</div>

<div class="line_en">After a number of disappointments they decided to walk and look in at the shop windows and let the cab follow them.

<div class="line_cn" title="经过多次失望后，父女俩决定一边走一边浏览商店的橱窗，让马车跟在后面。他们走过了两三家铺子，甚至没进去。这时他俩走近一家实在算不上很大的商店，萨拉突然跳起来，一把抓住父亲的胳臂。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="也许埃米莉早就认识萨拉。当萨拉把她搂到怀里时，埃米莉眼睛里的确有一种富有灵性的神情。她是个大洋娃娃，但并不大得难以携带；她有天然鬈曲的金褐色头发，下垂如帷幔，她的眼睛深陷，清澈，灰蓝色，柔软而浓密的睫毛是真的，而不是画上去的。">查看中文翻译</div>
