<div class="line_en">Philip could not get the unhappy event out of his head. What troubled him most was the uselessness of Fanny's effort. No one could have worked harder than she, nor with more sincerity; she believed in herself with all her heart; but it was plain that self-confidence meant very little, all his friends had it, Miguel Ajuria among the rest; and Philip was shocked by the contrast between the Spaniard's heroic endeavour and the triviality of the thing he attempted. The unhappiness of Philip's life at school had called up in him the power of self-analysis; and this vice, as subtle as drug-taking, had taken possession of him so that he had now a peculiar keenness in the dissection of his feelings. He could not help seeing that art affected him differently from others. A fine picture gave Lawson an immediate thrill. His appreciation was instinctive. Even Flanagan felt certain things which Philip was obliged to think out. His own appreciation was intellectual. He could not help thinking that if he had in him the artistic temperament (he hated the phrase, but could discover no other) he would feel beauty in the emotional, unreasoning way in which they did. He began to wonder whether he had anything more than a superficial cleverness of the hand which enabled him to copy objects with accuracy. That was nothing. He had learned to despise technical dexterity. The important thing was to feel in terms of paint. Lawson painted in a certain way because it was his nature to, and through the imitativeness of a student sensitive to every influence, there pierced individuality. Philip looked at his own portrait of Ruth Chalice, and now that three months had passed he realised that it was no more than a servile copy of Lawson. He felt himself barren. He painted with the brain, and he could not help knowing that the only painting worth anything was done with the heart.</div>

<div class="line_en">He had very little money, barely sixteen hundred pounds, and it would be necessary for him to practise the severest economy. He could not count on earning anything for ten years. The history of painting was full of artists who had earned nothing at all. He must resign himself to penury; and it was worth while if he produced work which was immortal; but he had a terrible fear that he would never be more than second-rate. Was it worth while for that to give up one's youth, and the gaiety of life, and the manifold chances of being? He knew the existence of foreign painters in Paris enough to see that the lives they led were narrowly provincial. He knew some who had dragged along for twenty years in the pursuit of a fame which always escaped them till they sunk into sordidness and alcoholism. Fanny's suicide had aroused memories, and Philip heard ghastly stories of the way in which one person or another had escaped from despair. He remembered the scornful advice which the master had given poor Fanny: it would have been well for her if she had taken it and given up an attempt which was hopeless.</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip finished his portrait of Miguel Ajuria and made up his mind to send it to the Salon. Flanagan was sending two pictures, and he thought he could paint as well as Flanagan. He had worked so hard on the portrait that he could not help feeling it must have merit. It was true that when he looked at it he felt that there was something wrong, though he could not tell what; but when he was away from it his spirits went up and he was not dissatisfied. He sent it to the Salon and it was refused. He did not mind much, since he had done all he could to persuade himself that there was little chance that it would be taken, till Flanagan a few days later rushed in to tell Lawson and Philip that one of his pictures was accepted. With a blank face Philip offered his congratulations, and Flanagan was so busy congratulating himself that he did not catch the note of irony which Philip could not prevent from coming into his voice. Lawson, quicker-witted, observed it and looked at Philip curiously. His own picture was all right, he knew that a day or two before, and he was vaguely resentful of Philip's attitude. But he was surprised at the sudden question which Philip put him as soon as the American was gone.</div>

<div class="line_en">Lawson was fond of Philip and, as soon as he thought he was seriously distressed by the refusal of his picture, he set himself to console him. It was notorious that the Salon had refused pictures which were afterwards famous; it was the first time Philip had sent, and he must expect a rebuff; Flanagan's success was explicable, his picture was showy and superficial: it was just the sort of thing a languid jury would see merit in. Philip grew impatient; it was humiliating that Lawson should think him capable of being seriously disturbed by so trivial a calamity and would not realise that his dejection was due to a deep-seated distrust of his powers.</div>

<div class="line_en">Of late Clutton had withdrawn himself somewhat from the group who took their meals at Gravier's, and lived very much by himself. Flanagan said he was in love with a girl, but Clutton's austere countenance did not suggest passion; and Philip thought it more probable that he separated himself from his friends so that he might grow clear with the new ideas which were in him. But that evening, when the others had left the restaurant to go to a play and Philip was sitting alone, Clutton came in and ordered dinner. They began to talk, and finding Clutton more loquacious and less sardonic than usual, Philip determined to take advantage of his good humour.</div>

One paints for oneself: otherwise one would commit suicide. Just think of it, you spend God knows how long trying to get something on to canvas, putting the sweat of your soul into it, and what is the result? Ten to one it will be refused at the Salon; if it's accepted, people glance at it for ten seconds as they pass; if you're lucky some ignorant fool will buy it and put it on his walls and look at it as little as he looks at his dining-room table. Criticism has nothing to do with the artist. It judges objectively, but the objective doesn't concern the artist."</div>

<div class="line_en">"The artist gets a peculiar sensation from something he sees, and is impelled to express it and, he doesn't know why, he can only express his feeling by lines and colours. It's like a musician; he'll read a line or two, and a certain combination of notes presents itself to him: he doesn't know why such and such words call forth in him such and such notes; they just do. And I'll tell you another reason why criticism is meaningless: a great painter forces the world to see nature as he sees it; but in the next generation another painter sees the world in another way, and then the public judges him not by himself but by his predecessor. So the Barbizon people taught our fathers to look at trees in a certain manner, and when Monet came along and painted differently, people said: But trees aren't like that. It never struck them that trees are exactly how a painter chooses to see them. We paint from within outwards -- if we force our vision on the world it calls us great painters; if we don't it ignores us; but we are the same. We don't attach any meaning to greatness or to smallness. What happens to our work afterwards is unimportant; we have got all we could out of it while we were doing it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“画家能从所见之物里获得一种奇特的感受，而且还迫不及待地想要把它表现出来。不知为何，他只能通过线条和色彩来描述心中所想。就像音乐家一样，他只要读上两行字，头脑里就会浮现出一串音符。他也不知道为什么眼前看到的字儿能让他脑海里浮现出那样的音符，但事情就是这么发生了。我再来告诉你为什么批评指正一点用处都没有吧。伟大的画家能强迫所有人透过他的眼睛看世界，可也许几十年后出现了一个视角不同的画家。大家评判他的作品时考虑的不是他的角度，还是按照老一辈的规矩来。巴比松画派教导我们的父辈用某种特定方法来观察树，但后来莫奈出现了，他画的树和之前的不一样。人们都说：‘树不长这样啊。’可他们从没想过，画家看到的树是什么样他画出来的就是什么样。画画是从里到外的艺术——要是能强迫所有人用我们的方式看世界，那我们就称得上是伟大的画家了。但假如做不到，别人就不会把我们当回事儿。可我们自始至终都是一样的。伟大或是渺小都不在乎。日后我们的作品成名也好，不成名也罢，都无所谓。因为我们已经从画画的过程中得到一切了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a pause while Clutton with voracious appetite devoured the food that was set before him. Philip, smoking a cheap cigar, observed him closely. The ruggedness of the head, which looked as though it were carved from a stone refractory to the sculptor's chisel, the rough mane of dark hair, the great nose, and the massive bones of the jaw, suggested a man of strength; and yet Philip wondered whether perhaps the mask concealed a strange weakness. Clutton's refusal to show his work might be sheer vanity: he could not bear the thought of anyone's criticism, and he would not expose himself to the chance of a refusal from the Salon; he wanted to be received as a master and would not risk comparisons with other work which might force him to diminish his own opinion of himself. During the eighteen months Philip had known him Clutton had grown more harsh and bitter; though he would not come out into the open and compete with his fellows, he was indignant with the facile success of those who did. He had no patience with Lawson, and the pair were no longer on the intimate terms upon which they had been when Philip first knew them.</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip, too, looked into the future, and he saw Clutton in twenty years, bitter, lonely, savage, and unknown; still in Paris, for the life there had got into his bones, ruling a small cenacle with a savage tongue, at war with himself and the world, producing little in his increasing passion for a perfection he could not reach; and perhaps sinking at last into drunkenness. Of late Philip had been captivated by an idea that since one had only one life it was important to make a success of it, but he did not count success by the acquiring of money or the achieving of fame; he did not quite know yet what he meant by it, perhaps variety of experience and the making the most of his abilities. It was plain anyway that the life which Clutton seemed destined to was failure. Its only justification would be the painting of imperishable masterpieces. He recollected Cronshaw's whimsical metaphor of the Persian carpet; he had thought of it often; but Cronshaw with his faun-like humour had refused to make his meaning clear: he repeated that it had none unless one discovered it for oneself. It was this desire to make a success of life which was at the bottom of Philip's uncertainty about continuing his artistic career. But Clutton began to talk again.</div>

<div class="line_en">Thinking of Cronshaw recalled to him the fact that he had not seen him for a week, and so, when Clutton left him, he wandered along to the cafe in which he was certain to find the writer. During the first few months of his stay in Paris Philip had accepted as gospel all that Cronshaw said, but Philip had a practical outlook and he grew impatient with the theories which resulted in no action. Cronshaw's slim bundle of poetry did not seem a substantial result for a life which was sordid. Philip could not wrench out of his nature the instincts of the middle-class from which he came; and the penury, the hack work which Cronshaw did to keep body and soul together, the monotony of existence between the slovenly attic and the cafe table, jarred with his respectability. Cronshaw was astute enough to know that the young man disapproved of him, and he attacked his philistinism with an irony which was sometimes playful but often very keen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="想到克朗肖的事，菲利普才发觉自己已经又一个礼拜没见过他了。等克拉顿走了之后，他转悠着去了那家一定能找到克朗肖的咖啡馆。刚来巴黎的几个月里，他一直把克朗肖的话奉为金科玉律，可他看待事物的眼光非常现实，对克朗肖那些无法付诸于实践的空泛理论渐渐失去了耐心。光有那一沓薄薄的诗稿总不能证明克朗肖这悲惨的一生收获颇丰吧。菲利普出身于中产阶级，他的性格中自然有着难以摒弃的阶级本能。他觉得克朗肖的穷困潦倒、为了混口饭吃所做的苦工、从咖啡馆到破阁楼两点一线的单调生活都与他心中“体面”的定义格格不入。克朗肖够机灵，他知道菲利普看不上自己，所以常用幽默却不失犀利的话来讽刺菲利普的世俗。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But is your friend a good painter?" asked Philip.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那你的朋友画得很好吗？”菲利普问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, not yet, he paints just like Pissarro. He hasn't found himself, but he's got a sense of colour and a sense of decoration. But that isn't the question. it's the feeling, and that he's got. He's behaved like a perfect cad to his wife and children, he's always behaving like a perfect cad; the way he treats the people who've helped him -- and sometimes he's been saved from starvation merely by the kindness of his friends -- is simply beastly. He just happens to be a great artist."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，现在水平还一般。他的画和毕沙罗很像。他还没有找到自己的风格，但他色彩感不错，审美水平也很好。这些都是雕虫小技，最重要的是要有感觉，他已经有了画画的感觉了。他对待老婆孩子简直禽兽不如。对待那些帮过他的人——要不是朋友们心软可怜他，他早就饿死不知道多少次了——也禽兽不如！可他却恰恰是位伟大的艺术家。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Philip pondered over the man who was willing to sacrifice everything, comfort, home, money, love, honour, duty, for the sake of getting on to canvas with paint the emotion which the world gave him. it was magnificent, and yet his courage failed him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普默默在脑海中构思出这样一个男人：牺牲一切，将舒适的生活、温暖的家庭、金钱、爱情、荣誉、责任统统撇下了，选择一意孤行，只为将世界予他的万千情感用油彩呈现在画布之上。这是多么了不起的行为啊！可是菲利普却没有如此胆量。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The metaphor irritated Philip, because it assumed for the speaker a romantic attitude and cast a slur upon the position which Philip instinctively felt had more to say for it than he could think of at the moment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克朗肖打的这个比方把菲利普惹急眼了。他把自己说得特别不食人间烟火，却掉过头来诋毁了菲利普一顿。菲利普想说点什么回击一通，但当时竟一时语塞，什么也没想出来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A change came over Cronshaw's placid, round face. The corners of the mouth were suddenly depressed, the eyes sunk dully in their orbits; he seemed to become strangely bowed and old.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克朗肖神色忽变，原本平静的大圆脸上微微起了些波澜。嘴角突然沮丧地垂了下去，眼睛也深深陷到眼眶当中，神采尽失。他的背一下子驼了，整个人缩成一团，看上去好像老了几岁。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"This?" he cried, looking round the cafe in which they sat. His voice really trembled a little. "If you can get out of it, do while there's time."</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip stared at him with astonishment, but the sight of emotion always made him feel shy, and he dropped his eyes. He knew that he was looking upon the tragedy of failure. There was silence. Philip thought that Cronshaw was looking upon his own life; and perhaps he considered his youth with its bright hopes and the disappointments which wore out the radiancy; the wretched monotony of pleasure, and the black future. Philip's eyes rested on the little pile of saucers, and he knew that Cronshaw's were on them too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普吃惊地看着他，很快又垂下了眼睛。这样慷慨激昂的场合总会让他特别害羞。他知道眼前这个男人的一生是出以失败而告终的悲剧。两个人都沉默了。菲利普心想，克朗肖现在一定也在思考着自己的人生——曾几何时，他也曾有着美好的设想和无尽的希望，但挫折和打击却一点点消磨了他的锐气，让生活变得晦暗无光。日复一日的推杯换盏变成了快乐的唯一来源，未来也漆黑一片，没有光亮。菲利普的眼神落到了面前的一摞杯碟上，他知道克朗肖也在怔怔盯着它们发呆。">查看中文翻译</div>
