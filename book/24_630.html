<div class="line_en">"The operative word is correct. You have never possessed real power, or the knowledge necessary to apply it. As in all problems, there are efficient and inefficient approaches. Suppose, for example, that one of your nations, led by some fanatical ruler, tried to revolt against me. The highly inefficient answer to such a threat would be some billions of horsepower in the shape of atomic bombs. If I used enough bombs, the solution would be complete and final. It would also, as I remarked, be inefficient -- even if it possessed no other defects."</div>

<div class="line_en">Fifty years is ample time in which to change a world and its people almost beyond recognition. All that is required for the task are a sound knowledge of social engineering, a clear sight of the intended goal -- and power. These things the Overlords possessed. Though their goal was hidden, their knowledge was obvious -- and so was their power.</div>

<div class="line_en">"That sounds a rather cynical remark," Stormgren had replied doubtfully. "It's a little too much like 'Might is Right'. In our own past, the use of power has been notably unsuccessful in solving anything."</div>

<div class="line_en">"That requires about as much power as a small radio transmitter -- and rather similar skills to operate. For it's the application of the power, not its amount, that matters. How long do you think Hitler's career as dictator of Germany would have lasted, if wherever he went a voice was talking quietly in his ear? Or if' a steady musical note, loud enough to drown all other sounds and to prevent sleep, filled his brain night and day? Nothing brutal, you appreciate. Yet, in the final analysis, just as irresistible as a tritium bomb."</div>

<div class="line_en">Karellen's calculations had been accurate. The shock of revulsion had passed swiftly, though there were many who prided themselves on their freedom from superstition yet would never be able to face one of the Overlords. There was something strange here, something beyond all reason or logic.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正如卡瑞林的估计，人类的震惊很快过去了，但还有不少人始终难以接受这些外星人，另外还出现了一个没有任何来由、也没有任何逻辑的猜测。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was, of course, universally assumed that the Overlords, or beings of the same species, had come into violent conflict with ancient man. The meeting must have lain in the remote past, for it had left no traces in recorded history. Here was another puzzle, and Karellen would give no help in its solution.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="显然没有任何历史记载，但几乎所有的人都相信这些外星人——或者是他们的同类曾和地球上的原始人类发生过激烈冲突。这个谜，卡瑞林不愿解答。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Overlords, though they had now shown themselves to man, seldom left their one remaining ship. Perhaps they found it physically uncomfortable on Earth, for their size, and the existence of their wings, indicated that they came from a world of much lower gravity. They were never seen without a belt adorned with complex mechanisms which, it was generally believed, controlled their weight and enabled them to communicate with each other. Direct sunlight was painful to them, and they never stayed in it for more than a few seconds. When they had to go into the open for any length of time, they wore dark glasses which gave them a somewhat incongruous appearance. Though they seemed able to breathe terrestrial air, they sometimes carried small cylinders of gas from which they refreshed themselves occasionally.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些外星人很少离开飞船，也许因为在地面上，他们感到身体不适。他们的个头和翅膀都表明在他们的星球上，重力要比地球小得多。他们总是系着一条腰带，上面有好些复杂的仪器，估计是用来调节体重和相互联络的。他们不能忍受阳光的直接照射，待在太阳地里不会超过几秒钟时间，必须外出时，就戴上一副让他们显得非常古怪的太阳镜。他们好像能够呼吸地球上的空气，但有时也带个气罐，不时用一用。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In many ways, the appearance of the Overlords had raised more problems than it had solved. Their origin was still unknown, their biology a source of endless speculation. On many matters they would give information freely, but on others their behaviour could only be described as secretive. On the whole, however, this did not annoy anyone except the scientists. The average man, though he might prefer not to meet the Overlords, was grateful to them for what they had done to his world.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在很多方面，外星人露面带来的问题远比他解决的问题要多。没有人知道他们从哪里来，他们的身体更是人们热衷的话题。这些外星人对有些问题有问必答，对有些问题就只能用“神秘”二字来形容。总的来说，除了科学家，其余的人并不因为他们的出现而恼羞成怒。一般人虽说不愿看见他们，但也感激他们对地球的贡献。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Perhaps these purely physical problems accounted for their aloofness. Only a small fraction of the human race had ever actually met an Overlord in the flesh, and no one could guess how many of them were aboard Karellen's ship. No more than five had ever been seen together at one time, but there might be hundreds, even thousands of them aboard that tremendous vessel.</div>

The cities that had been good enough for earlier generations had been rebuilt -- or deserted and left as museum specimens when they had ceased to serve any useful purpose. Many cities had already been abandoned in this manner, for the whole pattern of industry and commerce had changed completely. Production had become largely automatic: the robot factories poured forth consumer goods in such unending streams that all the ordinary necessities of life were virtually free. Men worked for the sake of the luxuries they desired; or they did not work at all.</div>

<div class="line_en">Crime had practically vanished. It had become both not necessary and impossible. When no one lacks anything, there is no point in stealing. Moreover, all potential criminals knew that there could be no escape from the surveillance of the Overlords. In the early days of their rule, they had intervened so effectively on behalf of law and order that the lesson had never been forgotten.</div>

<div class="line_en">One of the most noticeable changes had been a slowing-down of the mad tempo that had so characterized the twentieth century. Life was more leisurely than it had been for generations. It therefore had less zest for the few, but more tranquillity for the many. Western man had relearned -- what the rest of the world had never forgotten -- that there was nothing sinful in leisure as long as it did not degenerate into mere sloth.</div>

<div class="line_en">Whatever problems the future might bring, time did not yet hang heavy on humanity's hands. Education was now much more thorough and much more protracted. Few people left college before twenty -- and that was merely the first stage, since they normally returned again at twenty-five for at least three more years, after travel and experience had broadened their minds. Even then, they would probably take refresher courses at intervals for the remainder of their lives in the subjects that particularly interested them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不管将来会出现什么样的问题，时间总在人们指间匆匆流过。教育比以前更彻底，时间也更长了。几乎没有人会在二十岁前离开大学，大学还只是第一步，接着他们会去旅游，去体验生活，增长见识，二十五岁时再回到学校，学习三年，毕业后还会不时修一些自己感兴趣的课程充实自己。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This extension of human apprenticeship so far past the beginning of physical maturity had given rise to many social changes. Some of these had been necessary for generations, but earlier periods had refused to face the challenge -- or had pretended that it did not exist. In particular, the pattern of sexual mores -- insofar as there had ever been a single pattern -- had altered radically. It had been virtually shattered by two inventions, which were, ironically enough, of purely human origin and owed nothing to the Overlords. The first was a completely reliable oral contraceptive; the second was an equally infallible method -- as certain as fingerprinting, and based on a very detailed analysis of the blood -- of identifying the father of any child. The effect of these two inventions upon human society could only be described as devastating, and they had swept away the last remnants of the Puritan aberration.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迄今为止，人类学徒制的这种延伸已经超过了身体成熟的开始，已经引起了许多社会变化。其中一些是几代人所必需的，但早期拒绝面对挑战，或者假装挑战不存在。特别是，性习俗的模式——就曾经有过的单一模式而言——已经发生了根本性的改变。它几乎被两项发明所摧毁，讽刺的是，这两项发明都是纯人类的，与外星人毫无瓜葛。第一种是一种完全可靠的口服避孕药；第二种是同样可靠的方法——就像指纹一样确定，并且基于对血液的非常详细的分析——来确定任何孩子的父亲。这两项发明对人类社会的影响只能说是毁灭性的，它们已经扫除了清教徒的最后残余。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Another great change was the extreme mobility of the new society. Thanks to the perfection of air-transport, everyone was free to go anywhere at a moment's notice. There was more room in the skies than there had ever been on the roads, and the, twenty-first century had repeated, on a larger scale, the great American achievement of putting a nation on wheels. It had given wings to the world.</div>

<div class="line_en">Though not literally. The ordinary private flyer or air-car had no wings at all, or indeed any visible control surfaces. Even the clumsy rotor blades of the old helicopters had been banished. Yet Man had not discovered anti-gravity; only the Overlords possessed that ultimate secret. His air-cars were propelled by forces which the Wright brothers would have understood. Jet reaction, used both directly and in the more subtle form of boundary layer control, drove his flyers forward and held them in the air. As no laws or edicts of the Overlords could have done, the ubiquitous little air-cars had washed away the last barriers between the different tribes of mankind.</div>

It was known that the Overlords had access to the past, and more than once historians had appealed to Karellen to settle some ancient contro- versy. It may have been that he had grown tired of such questions, but it is more likely that he knew perfectly well what the outcome of his generosity would be…</div>

<div class="line_en">Profounder things had also passed. It was a completely secular age. Of the faiths that had existed before the coming of the Overlords, only a form of purified Buddhism -- perhaps the most austere of all religions -- still survived. The creeds that had been based upon miracles and revelations had collapsed utterly. With the rise of education, they had already been slowly dissolving, but for a while the Overlords had taken no sides in the matter. Though Karellen was often asked to express his views on religion, all that he would say was that a man's beliefs were his own affair, so long as they did not interfere with the liberty of others.</div>

<div class="line_en">Though it had always been obvious to any rational mind that all the world's religious writings could not be true, the shock was nevertheless profound. Here was a revelation which no one could doubt or deny: here, seen by some unknown magic of Overlord science, were the true beginnings of all the world's great faiths. Most of them were noble and inspiring -- but that was not enough. Within a few days, all mankind's multitudinous messiahs had lost their divinity. Beneath the fierce and passionless light of truth, faiths that had sustained millions for twice a thousand years vanished like morning dew. All the good and all the evil they had wrought were swept suddenly into the past, and could touch the minds of men no more.</div>

<div class="line_en">The instrument he handed over on permanent loan to the World History Foundation was nothing more than a television receiver with an elaborate set of controls for determining coordinates in time and space. It must have been linked somehow to a far more complex machine, operating on principles that no one could imagine, aboard Karellen's ship. One had merely to adjust the controls, and a window into the past was opened up. Almost the whole of human history for the past five thousand years became accessible in an instant. Earlier than that the machine would not go, and there were baffling blanks all down the ages. They might have had some natural cause, or they might be due to deliberate censorship by the Overlords.</div>

<div class="line_en">No one worried except a few philosophers. The race was too intent upon savouring its new-found freedom to look beyond the pleasures of the present. Utopia was here at last; its novelty had not yet been assailed by the supreme enemy of all Utopias -- boredom.</div>

<div class="line_en">If, indeed, it was altruism. For there were still some who wondered if the policies of the Overlords would always coincide with the true welfare of humanity.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="是无私帮助吗？他们制定的政策始终符合人类的真正利益吗？还是有少数人对此表示怀疑。">查看中文翻译</div>
