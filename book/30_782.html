<div class="line_en">Among the crowd of Olympian gods the one most widely admired was Apollo. He was the son of Zeus and Leto. According to Greek mythology, Leto was driven by Hera from land to land at last Poseidon took pity on her and brought the island of Delos out of water for her to live on. There she gave birth to the twins, Apollo and Artemis.</div>

<div class="line_en">Apollo was me sun-god. He wore a purple robe. He usually sat in his bright eastern palace early in the morning and madeready to start his daily journey across the sky. During the day he drove his carriage of gold and ivory, and brought light, life and love to the great world below. Late in the afternoon he came to the end of his journey in the far western sea and got on his golden boat to return to his eastern home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿波罗是太阳神。清晨他身着紫色长袍，坐在明亮的东方宫殿上，准备开始每日穿越天空的旅行。白天，他驾着用金子和象牙制成的战车，给广阔无垠的大地带来光明、生命和爱。黄昏时分，他在遥远的西海抵达旅行的终点，然后就乘上金船返回东方的家中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Apollo was the god of music and poetry. He could stir up all feelings. These feelings are expressed in lofty songs. With his lyre of gold and the sweet accents of his godlike voice heled the choir of the Muses at Olympus. The pleasant music from his lyre was so exciting that stones marched into their places in rhythmic time and of their own will when he helped Poseidon build up the walls of Troy. On one occasion, invited to a contest by the human musician Marsyas, he won and then flayed him to death for his pride. On another occasion, he lost out to Pan at a musical contest and turned the ears of the judge, King Midas, into those of an ass.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿波罗是音乐神和诗神。他可以唤起人们倾注于圣歌中的各种情感。在奥林匹斯山上，他手持金质里拉，用悦耳的音调指挥缪斯的唱诗班。当他帮助波塞冬建造特洛伊城墙时，里拉奏出的令人愉快的音乐如此动听，以致石头有节奏地自动各就其位。有一次，他接受人类音乐家马斯亚斯的邀请，参加了一次比赛。战胜对方后，他将对手剥皮致死以惩罚他的狂妄自大。在另外一次音乐比赛中，他输给了潘神，他就将裁判迈尔斯国王的耳朵变成了驴耳朵。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Apollo stood for youthful and manly beauty. His golden hair, stately manner and air all combined to make him the admiration of the world. A beautiful girl, by the name of Clytle, was so fond of his beauty and glory that from dawn to dusk she knelt on the ground, her hands outstretched towards the sungod, and her eyes looked at his golden wheeled carriage racing across the blue sky. Though her love was not returned, she had never changed her mind about Apollo. The gods were moved at the sad sight, and changed her into a sunflower.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿波罗象征着青春和阳刚之美。他那金色的头发、高贵的举止和容光焕发的神态巧妙地结合在一起，这些足以使他受到世人的青睐。一位名叫克里提的美丽少女迷恋于他的英俊潇洒，从黎明到黄昏，她都跪在地上，双手伸向太阳神。她凝视着那辆金质马车在蔚蓝的天空驰骋。虽然她的爱并未得到回报，但她对阿波罗的痴情却从未改变。目睹这一悲伤的场面，众神都深受感动，将她变成了一株向日葵。">查看中文翻译</div>
