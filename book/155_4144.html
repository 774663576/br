<div class="line_en">Our father didn't do anything. He worked in an office, not in a drugstore. Atticus did not drive a dump-truck for the county, he was not the sheriff, he did not farm, work in a garage, or do anything that could possibly arouse the admiration of anyone.</div>

<div class="line_en">With these attributes, however, he would not remain as inconspicuous as we wished him to: that year, the school buzzed with talk about him defending Tom Robinson, none of which was complimentary. After my bout with Cecil Jacobs when I committed myself to a policy of cowardice, word got around that Scout Finch wouldn't fight any more, her daddy wouldn't let her. This was not entirely correct: I wouldn't fight publicly for Atticus, but the family was private ground. I would fight anyone from a third cousin upwards tooth and nail. Francis Hancock, for example, knew that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管有这样的性格，他并不像我们希望的那样默默无闻：那一年，对他为汤姆·鲁宾逊辩护一事，学校里淡论纷纷，没一句话是说他好的。和塞西尔·雅各布较量后，我决定采取骂不还口打不还手的策略。于是有人说斯各特·芬奇再不会打架了，她爸爸不让她打。这并不完全对：我不会为阿迪克斯在外面打架，但家里是私人场所。从远房表兄弟算起，我谁都会打，决不手软。举例说吧，弗朗西斯·汉考克就知道这一点。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When he gave us our air-rifles Atticus wouldn't teach us to shoot. Uncle Jack instructed us in the rudiments thereof; he said Atticus wasn't interested in guns. Atticus said to Jem one day, "I'd rather you shot at tin cans in the back yard, but I know you'll go after birds. Shoot all the bluejays you want, if you can hit 'em, but remember it's a sin to kill a mockingbird."</div>
