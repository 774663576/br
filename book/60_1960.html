<div class="line_en">That afternoon, he had another interesting encounter. He was washing the display window of a large shoe shop when a young man came to a halt right next to him, leaned up close to the window, and began scrutinizing the prices.</div>

<div class="line_en">Prices are up, said Tomas without interrupting his pursuit of the rivulets trickling down the glass.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“全都涨价。”托马斯说，手里仍然拿海绵擦着滴水的玻璃。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">To clear the air Tomas came out with as sprightly a Fine, just fine! as he could muster, but he immediately felt that no matter how hard he tried (in fact, because he tried so hard), his fine sounded bitterly ironic. And so he quickly added, What's new at the hospital?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好得不能再好了。”托马斯用世上最开心的语气回答说，以减轻S的尴尬，但他马上意识到虽然他这样说（恰是因为他强作轻松），可这句“好得不能再好了”，却可能被解释为一种苦涩的讽刺。因此，他又马上补了一句：“医院里有什么新鲜事吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The man looked over at him. He was a hospital colleague of Tomas's, the one I have designated S., the very one who had sneered at Tomas while under the impression that Tomas had written a statement of self-criticism. Tomas was delighted to see him (naively so, as we delight in unexpected events), but what he saw in his former colleague's eyes (before S. had a chance to pull himself together) was a look of none-too-pleasant surprise.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个男人转过头来。原来是托马斯在医院的一个同事，我称之为S，一想到托马斯曾写过自我批评，他就感到气愤，但却始终带着微笑。碰到他让托马斯很高兴（不期而遇的事情给我们带来的是天真的快乐），但他在他同事的眼神中抓住了（在第一秒的时候，这时S还没来得及控制自己的反应）一种不舒服的惊诧表情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">How are you? S. asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“最近怎么样？”S问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Before Tomas could respond, he realized that S. was ashamed of having asked. It was patently ridiculous for a doctor practicing his profession to ask a doctor washing windows how he was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="还没有想好怎样回答，托马斯就意识到S对自己的提问很难为情。一个仍在从事原来职业的医生却去问一个如今在擦玻璃的医生“最近怎么样？”，这显然是愚蠢的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">How's the chief? asked Tomas.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“主任怎么样了？”托马斯询问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Same as always. His response, too, though meant to be as neutral as possible, was completely inappropriate, and they both knew it. And they knew they both knew it. How can things be the same as always when one of them is washing windows?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="即使这个尽量想做到完全中性的回答，也极不恰当。每个人都知道，也都知道别人也知道：当两个医生中的一个去擦玻璃了，一切又怎么可能正常呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was true. From the day he left, he had not seen the chief surgeon even once.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是真的。自从他离开医院以后，他再也没有见过主任。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Nothing, S. answered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“什么也没有，一切正常。”S回答说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">You mean you don't see him? asked S.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你没有看到他吗？”S问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And they had worked so well together; they had even tended to think of themselves as friends. So no matter how he said it, his no had a sad ring, and Tomas suspected that S. was angry with him for bringing up the subject: like the chief surgeon, S. had never dropped by to ask Tomas how he was doing or whether he needed anything.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管他们以前曾是优秀的合作伙伴，几乎都把对方当作朋友看待。不管他怎么说，刚才他那个“没”字都有着几许悲哀。托马斯猜想S一定怪他不该提这个问题，因为S自己就像主任一样，从未打探过托马斯的消息，关心他需要些什么。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">All conversation between the two former colleagues had become impossible, even though they both regretted it, Tomas especially. He was not angry with his colleagues for having forgotten him. If only he could make that clear to the young man beside him. What he really wanted to say was There's nothing to be ashamed of! It's perfectly normal for our paths not to cross. There's nothing to get upset about! I'm glad to see you! But he was afraid to say it, because everything he had said so far failed to come out as intended, and these sincere words, too, would sound sarcastic to his colleague.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这两个旧同事之间的谈话变得无法进行下去，即使这两个人，尤其是托马斯，对此感到很懊恼。他并没有因为他的同事们忘记了他而心存怨恨。他原本很想马上向这位年轻的医生解释清楚。他想对他说：“不要一副尴尬的样子。你们没有设法和我联系，这很正常，完全在理！不要把这放在心上！我很高兴见到你！”但即使是这些话，他也不敢说出来，因为到此为止，他说的话没有一句反映了他本来的意思，如果他说出来了，他的老同事也可能怀疑这句原本真诚的话后面隐藏着讥讽。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">No, said Tomas.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then again, even his old patients had stopped sending for him, to say nothing of greeting him with champagne. The situation of the declasse intellectual was no longer exceptional; it had turned into something permanent and unpleasant to confront.</div>

<div class="line_en">During the period when his colleagues turned their noses up at him for his supposed cowardice, they all smiled at him. Now that they could no longer scorn him, now that they were constrained to respect him, they gave him a wide berth.</div>
