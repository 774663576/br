<div class="line_en">Although she was an aerospace engineer from the Common Era, Cheng Xin had never been in space until this day, three centuries later. It no longer required special training to ride any space vehicles, but in consideration for her lack of experience, the technical support staff suggested that she ascend in the space elevator. Since the entirety of the ride was conducted at the same speed, there would be no hypergravity. And the gravity inside the elevator car now wasn't noticeably lower -- gravity would diminish gradually, until she achieved complete weightlessness at the terminal station in geosynchronous orbit. At this altitude, one would experience weightlessness only when orbiting the Earth, not when going up in a space elevator. Occasionally, Cheng Xin saw tiny dots sweep past in the distance -- probably from satellites coasting at first cosmic velocity.</div>

<div class="line_en">Viewed through the portholes in the elevator, Cheng Xin's entire world consisted of an eighty-centimeter-thick guide rail. The guide rail extended endlessly both above and below her, shrinking into invisibility in each direction. She had been riding for an hour already and was more than a thousand kilometers above sea level, outside the atmosphere. The Earth below her was in the shadow of night, and the continents were mere hazy outlines with no substance. The space above her was inky blackness, and the terminal station, thirty thousand kilometers away, was invisible. One felt as though the guide rail pointed to a road from which there was no return.</div>

<div class="line_en">The guide rail's surface was very smooth, and it was almost impossible to see motion. The elevator car seemed to be sitting still on the rail. In reality, her velocity was fifteen hundred kilometers per hour, equivalent to a supersonic jet. Reaching geosynchronous orbit would take about twenty hours, which made this a very slow journey in the context of space. Cheng Xin recalled a conversation during college where Tianming had pointed out that in principle, it was perfectly possible to achieve spaceflight at low speeds. As long as one maintained an ever-upward speed, one could go into space going as slow as a car or even walking. One could even walk up to the orbit of the moon in this manner, though it would be impossible to step onto the moon -- by then, the relative velocity of the moon with respect to the climber would be more than three thousand kilometers per hour, and if one were to attempt to remain at rest with respect to the moon, the result would once again be high-speed astronautics. Cheng Xin clearly recalled that he had said at the end that it would be an amazing sight to be in the vicinity of the moon's orbit and watch the gigantic satellite sweep overhead. She was now experiencing the low-speed spaceflight he had imagined.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="导轨表面很光滑。几乎看不出运动。运载舱仿佛静止地悬在导轨上。其实这时运载舱的运行速度是每小时一千五百千米左右。相当于一架超音速飞机，到达同步轨道需要大约二十个小时，这在太空中确实是一个很低的速度。程心想起在大学时的一次什么讨论中，云天明曾说。从原理上讲低速航天是完全可能的，只要能维持恒定上升的动力，以汽车的速度，甚至以步行的速度也可以走到太空，甚至可以走到月球执道，但不可能登上月球，因为那时月球与走过去的人有着每小时三十多千米的相对速度，如果试图消除这种速度与月球保持静止，那就又成高速航天了。程心还清楚地记得他最后说：在月球轨道附近，看着庞大的月亮从头顶飞速凉过，肯定很震撼。现在她就是在他说过的低速航天中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The elevator car was shaped like a capsule, but divided into four decks. She was in the top deck, and those who accompanied her were in the lower three decks. No one came up to bother her. She was in the luxurious business-class cabin, like a room in a five-star hotel. There was a comfortable bed and a shower, but the suite was small, about the size of a college dorm room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="运载舱呈胶囊形，一共有四层，程心在从最上一层，陪同她的人都在下面三层，没人来打扰她。她所在的是豪华商务舱，像五星酒店的房问，有很舒服的床，有沐浴间，但窄小许多，大小相当于大宿舍吧。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At this altitude, the Earth's umbral cone was narrower, and the Sun thus became visible. Everything outside was submerged in the powerful, bright light, and the portholes automatically adjusted to decrease their transparency. Cheng Xin lay on the sofa and watched the guide rail above her through the porthole overhead. The endless straight line seemed to descend directly from the Milky Way. She wanted to see signs of motion against the guide rail, or at least to imagine it. The sight was hypnotic, and eventually she fell asleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这个高度，地球的阴影去很小，太阳出现了，外面的一切都淹没在强光重，周围的舷窗自动调低了透明度。程心仰躺在沙发上，透过上方的舷窗继续看着导轨，那根漫无尽头的长线仿佛是从银河系垂下来的，她极力想从轨道上看出运动，想象出运动来，这种凝视具有催眠作用，她渐渐睡着了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She heard someone call her name softly, a man's voice. She saw that she was in a college dorm sleeping in the bottom bunk of a bunk bed. But the room was otherwise empty. A streak of light moved across the wall, like streetlights inside a moving car. She looked outside the window and saw that, behind the familiar Chinese parasol tree, the Sun swept across the sky rapidly, rising and setting every few seconds. Even when the Sun was up, however, the sky behind it remained inky black, and the stars shone along with the Sun. The voice continued to call her name. She wanted to get up to look around, but found her body floating up from the bed. Books, cups, her notebook computer, and other objects floated around her…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="朦胧中，程心听到有人在轻唤她的名字。是一个男声，她发现自己置身于大学宿舍中，躺在下铺，但房间里空无一人。她看到墙上有光影移动，就像路灯照进行驶的车内，看看窗外，发现在那颗熟悉的梧桐树后，太阳飞快地划过天空，几秒钟就升降一次，即使太阳升起时，它背后的天空也是漆黑的，星星和太阳一起出现。那声音仍在呼唤她的名字，她想起身看看，却发现自己的身体从床面上漂浮起来，书本、水杯和笔记本电脑等也漂浮在周围……">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Cheng Xin woke up with a start, and found herself truly floating in air, hovering a small distance above the sofa. She reached out to pull herself back onto the sofa, but inadvertently pushed herself away. She rose until she was next to the porthole in the ceiling, where she turned around weightlessly and pushed against the glass, successfully sending herself back to the sofa. Everything looked the same in the cabin, except that the weightlessness released some of the settled dust motes, and they sparkled in the sunlight.</div>

<div class="line_en">Cheng Xin looked up. She saw the guide rail again, but now she could tell they were moving by its surface -- a sign that they were slowing down. At the end of the rail, the geosynchronous terminal station was coming into view. It was formed of multiple concentric rings connected together by five radial spokes. The original terminal station was just a small part in the center. The concentric rings were later additions, with the outer rings being newer. The entire structure slowly rotated in place.</div>

<div class="line_en">Cheng Xin also saw other space buildings appear around her. The dense cluster of buildings in this region was the result of engineers taking advantage of proximity to the space elevator terminal station for transportation of construction materials. The buildings were of different shapes and appeared from the distance as a bunch of intricate toys -- only when one swept past at close range could their immensity be felt. Cheng Xin knew that one of these housed the headquarters of the Halo Group, her space construction company. AA was working in it right now, but she couldn't tell which building it was.</div>

<div class="line_en">The elevator car passed through a massive frame. The dense struts in the frame made the sunlight flicker. By the time the car emerged from the other end of the frame, the terminal station took up most of the view, and the Milky Way twinkled only from the space between the concentric rings. The immense structure pressed down, and as the car entered the station, everything dimmed as though the car was entering a tunnel. A few minutes later, bright lights illuminated the outside: The car was in the terminal hall. The hall spun around the car, and for the first time Cheng Xin felt dizzy. But as the car detached from the guide rail, it was clamped by the platform. After a slight jolt, the car began to spin along with the station, and everything around her seemed to be still again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="运载舱从一个巨大的框架结构中穿过，阳光被密集的框架切碎，从另一端升出时，终端站已经占据了上方的大部分太空，银河只是透过圆环间的缝隙闪烁。这巨大的结构从上方扑天盖地压下，运载舱进入终端站时四周暗了下来，如同火车进人隧洞。几分钟后，外面出现明亮的灯光，运载舱进入终端大厅停住了。周围的大厅在旋转，程心第一次感到有些头晕，但运载舱与导轨脱离后，被一个夹具在中部固定，一阵轻微的震动后。它也随终端站整体一起旋转，周围的一切静止了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Cheng Xin, accompanied by four others, emerged into the circular hall from the car. As their car was the only one at the platform, the hall seemed very empty. Cheng Xin felt a sense of familiarity right away: Although information windows floated everywhere, the main structure of the hall was built from metallic materials that were rare in this age, mainly stainless steel and lead alloys. She could see the marks left by the passage of years everywhere, and she felt herself situated in an old train station instead of in space. The elevator she had ridden was the first space elevator ever built, and this terminal station, completed in Year 15 of the Crisis Era, had been in continuous operation for more than two centuries, even through the Great Ravine. Cheng Xin noticed the guardrails crisscrossing the hall, installed to help people move around in weightlessness. The guardrails were mainly made of stainless steel, though some were made from copper. Observing their surfaces, bearing the marks of countless hands through more than two centuries of service, Cheng Xin was reminded of the deep ruts left in front of ancient city doors.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="程心与四名陪同人员一起走出运载舱，进人圆形的终端大厅。由于他们是这一时段到来的唯一一架运载舱，大厅里显得很空旷。程心对这里的第一印象就是熟悉，虽然这里也到处飘浮着信息窗口，但大厅的主体是用现在早已不再使用的金属材料建造的，主要是不锈钢和铅合金，到处都可以看到岁月的痕迹，她仿佛不是置身于太空，而是在一个旧火车站的候车大厅里。他们乘坐的是人类建成的第一部太空电梯，这个终端站建于危机纪元15年，已经连续使用了两个多世纪，即使在大低谷时期也没有关闭过。程心注意到大厅中纵横交错的栏杆，那是为人员在失重环境中移动设置的。这显然是早期的设施，因为现在都使用个人失重推进器，它体积很小，使用时固定在腰带或肩上，可以在失重中对人产生推力，由一个手持控制器控制移动方向。那些栏杆大部分是不锈钢制造，甚至还有一部分是铜制的，看着它们经过两个多世纪中无数只手磨损的表面，程心竟想到了古老城门前深深的车辙印。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The rails were leftovers from an earlier age, since everyone now relied on individual tiny thrusters which could be worn on the belt or over the shoulders. They generated enough thrust to propel people around in weightlessness, controlled by a handheld remote. Cheng Xin's companions tried to give her a first lesson in space -- how to use the weightless thrusters. But Cheng Xin preferred to navigate around by grabbing on to the guardrails. As they arrived at the exit to the main hall, Cheng Xin paused to admire a few propaganda posters on the wall. These were ancient, and most of them dealt with the construction of the Solar System defense system. In one of the posters, a soldier's figure filled most of the image. He was dressed in a uniform unfamiliar to Cheng Xin, and his fiery eyes stared at the viewer. Below him was a line of large text: The Earth needs you! Next to it was an even larger poster in which people of all races and nationalities stood, arms linked, to form a dense wall. Behind them, the blue flag of the UN took up most of the picture. The text on the poster read: Let us build a new Great Wall for the Solar System with our flesh! Although Cheng Xin was interested in the posters, they didn't feel familiar. They seemed to harken back to an older style, reminding people of an age before she had even been born.</div>

<div class="line_en">Cheng Xin and the others exited the main hall into a long corridor, whose cross section was also circular. The corridor extended ahead of her for some distance, and she couldn't see to the end. She knew that this was one of the five radial spokes of the station. At first, they moved in total weightlessness, but soon, "gravity" appeared, in the form of centrifugal force. At first, the force was very weak, but it was enough to induce a sense of up and down: the corridor suddenly turned into a deep well, and instead of floating, they were falling. Cheng Xin felt dizzy, but many guardrails protruded from the wall of the "well." If she felt she was falling too fast, she could decelerate by grabbing on to one of the rails.</div>

<div class="line_en">They passed the intersection between the spoke and the first ring. Cheng Xin looked to the right and left, and saw that the ground rose up on both sides, as though she were at the bottom of a valley. Over the entrances to the ring on both sides were red-glowing signs: First Ring, Gravity 0.15G. The wall of the curved corridor of the ring was punctuated by multiple doors, which opened and closed from time to time. Cheng Xin saw many pedestrians. They stood on the floor of the ring due to the microgravity, but they still moved by leaping ahead with the aid of the weightless thrusters.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们很快经过了第一个十字路口，程心向垂直交叉的另一条走廊看去，发现在两个方向上地面都向上升起，像一座小山谷一样，显然这是终端站的第一个圆环。程心看到走廊的两个人口都有一个发红光的标志，上面写着：终端一环，重力0.15G。向上弯曲的走廊两侧都有一排整齐的密封门，不时开启关闭。有很多行人，他们虽然在微重力下可以直立着地，但显然还得借助失重推进器进行跳跃行进。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After passing through the first ring, the weight increased further, and free-falling was no longer safe. Escalators appeared on the wall of the "well," one going up and one going down.

The wall of the well had many information windows of different sizes, and more than a few of them were broadcasting the image of Cheng Xin stepping onto the space elevator more than twenty hours ago.

<div class="line_en">As they descended, they passed through seven more concentric rings. As the diameter of each successive ring grew, the curvature of the corridors to the sides became less noticeable. Cheng Xin felt as though she was passing through strata of history. Each ring used different construction material from the rings before it, and looked newer. Each ring's method of construction and decorative style formed a time capsule of an age: the repressive militaristic uniformity of the Great Ravine; the optimism and romanticism of the latter half of the Crisis Era; the hedonistic freedom and indolence of the Deterrence Era. Before the fourth ring, the cabins in the rings were integrated into the structure of the rings, but starting with the fifth ring, the rings only provided construction spaces, and the buildings in the rings were planned and constructed later as additional fixtures, showing a rich variety of styles. As Cheng Xin descended through the rings, signs of this being a space station gradually faded, and the environment resembled daily life on the surface more. By the time they reached the eighth ring, the outermost ring of the station, the construction style and scenery were indistinguishable from a small city on the surface.

Next to it stood a group of people who had apparently been waiting for her.

The entrance to the flat hall was marked with "Port A225," and a few dozen small spacecraft of various designs parked on the smooth, plazalike floor. One side of the hall was completely open to space and the stars spinning around the station. Not too far away from them, a bright light started to glow, illuminating the whole port. Gradually, the light turned from orange to pure blue, and the spaceship that had turned on its engines lifted off the floor, accelerated, and shot into space from the open side of the port. Cheng Xin was witnessing a technological miracle that had become commonplace for others, but she couldn't figure out how it was possible to maintain atmosphere and pressure in space without the area being completely enclosed.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ten minutes later, Cheng Xin got to see a sunrise in space. The Sun slowly rose over the curved edge of the Earth. From such distance, the waves over the Pacific were invisible, and the ocean was like a mirror reflecting sunlight. The clouds appeared as soapy foam over the mirror. From this vantage point, the Sun appeared much smaller than the Earth, like a shining golden egg being birthed by this dark blue world. By the time the Sun had completely emerged from the curved horizon, the side of the Earth facing the Sun turned into a giant crescent. The crescent was so bright that the rest of the Earth merged into dark shadow, and the Sun and the crescent seemed to form a giant symbol hovering in space.

<div class="line_en">The special team had told Cheng Xin again and again that the flight itself would be routine, no more special than the airplane rides she used to take. The distance between the terminal station and the Lagrangian point was about 1.5 million kilometers, or one hundredth of an astronomical unit. This was considered an extremely short spaceflight, and the craft she rode in was well suited for such brief trips. Cheng Xin recalled that three centuries ago, one of the things that had lured her into aerospace engineering was a great accomplishment by humankind during the twentieth century: fifteen men had managed to step onto the moon. Their voyage had only been a fifth as long as the journey she was about to undertake.</div>

As the hypergravity disappeared, Cheng Xin felt as though a pair of arms hugging her tightly had relaxed. The dinghy coasted toward the Sun, and the light from the Sun overwhelmed all the stars. The transparent hull adjusted and dimmed until the Sun was a disc whose brightness was no longer blinding. Cheng Xin reached out to adjust it even more, until the Sun resembled the full moon. She still had six more hours to travel. She drifted in weightlessness, drifted in the moonlight-like sun.</div>

<div class="line_en">She imagined the corner of space she happened to be in. Here, the Sun's gravity overcame the Earth's, reaching balance, so this place held an extra measure of emptiness compared to other spots in space. She was in this emptiness of zero, a lonely, independent presence that had no connections to any other part of the cosmos… In this way, she managed to drive her complicated emotions out of her consciousness, until she achieved the blank, transcendent state she wanted.</div>

Cheng Xin saw a sphere about three or four meters in diameter appear a few meters in front of the dinghy. The sphere blocked the Earth and took up most of her view.

<div class="line_en">Above this dark-soiled scene was an alien sky -- a dome, to be exact, formed of a knotty mess of intertwined pipes, some thick, some thin, all of which were leaden gray in color. Among the thousands of pipes, two or three glowed red. The light from them was very bright, making them appear as incandescent filaments. The exposed portions of these pipes illuminated the fields and apparently provided the source of energy for the crops. Each illuminated pipe only shone briefly before dimming, to be replaced by another pipe that lit up elsewhere. At each moment, two or three pipes were on. The shifting lights caused the shadows in the field to shift constantly as well, as though the sun were weaving in and out of clouds.</div>

<div class="line_en">Cheng Xin was taken aback by the chaotic arrangement of the pipes. It wasn't the result of carelessness; on the contrary, to create this kind of utter chaos required great effort and design. The arrangement seemed to find even the hint of a pattern to be taboo. This suggested an aesthetic utterly at odds with human values: Patterns were ugly, but the lack of order was beautiful. Those glowing pipes gave the entire knotty mess a kind of liveliness, like sunlight glanced through clouds. Cheng Xin even wondered whether the arrangement was meant to be an artistic representation of the sun and clouds. But the next moment, she felt the arrangement evoking a giant model of the human brain, and the flickering, glowing pipes represented the formation of each neural feedback loop…</div>

A far more likely explanation was that the entire system was nothing more than a heat dissipation device, and the farm fields below only took advantage of the lights as a side effect. Going by appearance alone, and without understanding its operation, Cheng Xin intuited that the system showed a kind of engineering ideal that could not be understood by humanity. She felt mystified, but also mesmerized.</div>

He looked young, about the same age as when they had parted three centuries ago. But his physique looked more fit, and his face was tanned. He wasn't gazing in Cheng Xin's direction; instead, he pulled off an ear of wheat, rubbed it in his fingers, blew away the husk, and then tossed the grains into his mouth.

During the Staircase Project, he was a haggard, weak, terminal patient; before then, he was a solitary, alienated college student.

The Tianming of the present revealed only maturity. One couldn't read his story at all, though he certainly had stories, stories that probably offered more twists, strange events, and spectacular sights than ten Odysseys. Three centuries of drifting alone in the depths of space, an unimaginable life among aliens, the countless tribulations and trials endured in body and spirit -- none of these had left any mark on his body.
