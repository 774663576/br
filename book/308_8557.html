<div class="line_en">Caroline, of course, had not failed to see Miss Russell come to the surgery door. I had anticipated this, and had ready an elaborate account of the lady's bad knee.

I should hope that I never screw confidences out of anybody. For instance, ifM. Poirot comes in this afternoon, as he said he might do, I shall not dream of asking him who it was arrived at his house early this morning."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你太自私了，詹姆斯，”她说，“你讨厌说闲话，自己把嘴封得严严实实，却以为人人都得跟你学。我可从不强迫别人透露隐私。比如，如果波洛先生今天下午过来的话——他之前说要来我们家的——我才不会追问今天一早谁进了他家门。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Very early," said Caroline. "Before the milk came. I just happened to be looking out of the window -- the blind was flapping. It was a man.

<div class="line_en">I was amused to see Caroline's manoeuvres that afternoon when Poirot duly arrived. My sister, without asking a direct question, skirted the subject of the mysterious guest in every way imaginable. By the twinkle in Poirot's eyes, I saw that he realized her object. He remained blandly impervious, and blocked her bowling so successfully that she herself was at a loss how to proceed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="下午波洛如约而来，卡洛琳使出浑身解数刺探情报，我不禁暗自好笑。姐姐没有直接发问，而是运用所能想出来的种种伎俩，拐弯抹角地把话题引向波洛的神秘客人。从波洛眼中的光芒，我知道他早已识破了卡洛琳的意图。他一一回应，无形中化解了卡洛琳的攻势。到最后卡洛琳自感无趣，接不下去了。">查看中文翻译</div>
