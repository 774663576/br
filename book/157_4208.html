<div class="line_en">One day I received a letter from the editor of a famous weekly publication. He suggested that I submit to him a humorous composition to fill a column of space; hinting that he would make it a regular feature of each issue if the work proved satisfactory. I did so, and at the end of two weeks he offered to make a contract with me for a year at a figure that was considerably higher than the amount paid me by the hardware firm.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我成功了。我在周刊上的专栏引起了小小的轰动，评论界也低声议论着我的名字，说我是幽默家队伍中的新秀。我又向其他刊物投稿，收入大为增加。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I picked up the tricks of the trade. I could take a funny idea and make a two-line joke of it, earning a dollar. With false whiskers on, it would serve up cold as a quatrain, doubling its producing value. By turning the skirt and adding a ruffle of rhyme you would hardly recognize it as vers de societe with neatly shod feet and a fashion-plate illustration.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我找到了这一行的诀窍。我可以抓住一个有趣的想法，写成一则两行文字的笑话，挣一块钱。然后稍加改动，改头换面，凑把假胡子，就能把它拉成四行，我就可以把它当做冷盘上桌，从而使产值翻了一倍。在此基础上，再经过乔装打扮，用韵脚镶上花边，配上一幅漂亮的插图，它便成了一首诙谐的讽刺诗，保证你根本认不出它的本来面目。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After five or six months the spontaniety seemed to depart from my humor. Quips and droll sayings no longer fell carelessly from my lips. I was sometimes hard run for material. I found myself listening to catch available ideas from the conversation of my friends. Sometimes I chewed my pencil and gazed at the wall paper for hours trying to build up some gay little bubble of unstudied fun.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="五六个月之后，那种信手拈来的幽默感仿佛远离了我，双关妙语和隽永言辞不再脱口而出。有时我才思枯竭，找不到创作的素材。我开始注意倾听朋友们的交谈，希望从中汲取一些可以利用的东西。有时，我咬着铅笔，一连好几个小时瞪着墙纸，想编造出一些不那么矫揉造作又愉快诙谐的泡沫。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And then I became a harpy, a Moloch, a Jonah, a vampire, to my acquaintances. Anxious, haggard, greedy, I stood among them like a veritable killjoy. Let a bright saying, a witty comparison, a piquant phrase fall from their lips and I was after it like a hound springing upon a bone. I dared not trust my memory; but, turning aside guiltily and meanly, I would make a note of it in my ever-present memorandum book or upon my cuff for my own future use.</div>

<div class="line_en">The day was chill and rainy. We went into the back room, where a fire burned, in a little stove. A customer came, and Peter left me alone for a while. Presently I felt a new feeling stealing over me -- a sense of beautiful calm and content, I looked around the place. There were rows of shining rosewood caskets, black palls, trestles, hearse plumes, mourning streamers, and all the paraphernalia of the solemn trade. Here was peace, order, silence, the abode of grave and dignified reflections. Here, on the brink of life, was a little niche pervaded by the spirit of eternal rest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天天气阴冷，还下着雨，我们走进他后面的房间，那儿的一个小炉子生着火。有位顾客来了，彼得让我独自待了一会儿。我立刻产生了一种崭新的感觉——一种美妙的宁谧与满足感。我环顾四周，房间里是一排排闪闪发亮的黑黄檀木棺材、黑色的棺衣、棺材架、装饰灵车的羽毛、灵幡以及从事这一庄重行业的一切配备。这里的气氛安详、宁静、沉寂，是庄严肃穆的沉思场所。这里处于生命的边缘，是永恒的安静所笼罩的安息之所。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One day a man spoke to me, with a pleasant and friendly smile. Not in months had the thing happened. I was passing the undertaking establishment of Peter Heffelbower. Peter stood in the door and saluted me. I stopped, strangely wrung in my heart by his greeting. He asked me inside.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天，有个人面带愉快而友好的微笑，向我打招呼。这是我几个月以来第一次遇到这种情形。当时，我正从彼得·赫弗尔鲍尔殡仪馆门前走过，彼得站在门里，向我打招呼。我感到一阵莫名的难过，停住了脚步。他请我进去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When I entered it, the follies of the world abandoned me at the door. I felt no inclination to wrest a humorous idea from those sombre and stately trappings. My mind seemed to stretch itself to grateful repose upon a couch draped with gentle thoughts.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我步入屋子的瞬间，尘世间一切愚昧便与我分道扬镳了。身处这个阴沉庄严的环境中，我再也没有兴趣去思索什么幽默的东西。我的心灵仿佛舒服地躺在卧榻之上，四周还悬挂着温柔的思绪。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But, no. He chimed truly. I gave a long sigh of happiness. Never have I known a man's talk to be as magnificently dull as Peter's was. Compared with it the Dead Sea is a geyser. Never a sparkle or a glimmer of wit marred his words. Commonplaces as trite and as plentiful as blackberries flowed from his lips no more stirring in quality than a last week's tape running from a ticker. Quaking a little, I tried upon him one of my best pointed jokes. It fell back ineffectual, with the point broken. I loved that man from then on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是，他没有。他的谈吐与这里的气氛非常和谐。我宽慰地长长舒了一口气。我生平从未遇到有谁能像他一样，言谈之间平淡、质朴至极。同他相比，死海都可以算是喷泉了。没有一丝风趣的火花或闪光冒出来破坏他的语言，他嘴里吐出的字句皆为陈词滥调，像黑莓那般随处可见，像股票行情自动收录器送出来的一星期之前的股票行情一般，丝毫不能引起别人的注意。我激动得微微颤抖，拿我最得意的笑话试探他。不料，它被无声无息地弹了回来，锋芒尽失。从那一刻起，我就喜欢上了这个人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I had not known Heffelbower well. When he came back, I let him talk, fearful that he might prove to be a jarring note in the sweet, dirgelike harmony of his establishment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="以前我对赫弗尔鲍尔不太熟悉，所以他回来时，我就让他先说话。我唯恐他一开口就破坏了气氛，成为这里甜蜜挽歌般美妙的和谐气氛中刺耳的音符。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A quarter of an hour ago I was an abandoned humorist. Now I was a philosopher, full of serenity and ease. I had found a refuge from humor, from the hot chase of the shy quip, from the degrading pursuit of the panting joke, from the restless reach after the nimble repartee.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一刻钟之前，我还是一位众叛亲离的幽默家。而此刻，我却成了一名怡然自得的哲学家。我找到了一个庇护所，在这里，可以逃避幽默，不必绞尽脑汁去搜寻一句嘲弄的笑话，也不必为追寻一句令人发笑的噱头而斯文扫地，更不必费尽周折，永不停止地去找佳句妙语。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Two or three evenings each week I would steal down to Heffelbower's and revel in his back room. That was my only joy. I began to rise early and hurry through my work, that I might spend more time in my haven. In no other place could I throw off my habit of extracting humorous ideas from my surroundings. Peter's talk left me no opening had I besieged it ever so hard.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每星期总有两三个晚上，我要溜到赫弗尔鲍尔那里去，沉湎在他后面的房间里。那里成了我唯一的乐趣。我开始早早起床，匆匆忙忙做完工作，以便留出更多的时间让我在我的庇护所里消磨。在别的任何地方，我都没法抛弃从周围环境榨取幽默素材的习惯，只有和彼得的谈话除外，任凭我如何围攻纠缠，他都滴水不漏。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I went home with feelings of delirious joy, mingled with a certain amount of doubt. I was dreading to tell my wife about it. But I walked on air. To give up the writing of humorous stuff, once more to enjoy the apples of life, instead of squeezing them to a pulp for a few drops of hard cider to make the pubic feel funny -- what a boon that would be!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我欣喜若狂地回到家里，欣喜中还掺杂着些许顾虑：我不敢把这件事告诉妻子，可是心里总有说不出的高兴。因为我可以放弃幽默创作，再度享受生活的果实，而不必把它们榨得稀烂，从中挤出几滴博人一笑的果汁——那将是何等地畅快！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One day Peter Heffelbower laid before me a temptation that swept me off my feet. In his sensible, uninspired way he showed me his books, and explained that his profits and his business were increasing rapidly. He had thought of taking in a partner with some cash. He would rather have me than any one he knew. When I left his place that afternoon Peter had my check for the thousand dollars I had in the bank, and I was a partner in his undertaking business.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一天，彼得·赫弗尔鲍尔向我提出了一个诱人的建议，使我喜出望外。他以贯有的理智平实的态度把他的账册拿给我看，向我解释说，他的收益和事业正在蒸蒸日上，他打算找一个愿意投资的股东。在他认识的人中间，他觉得我最为理想。那天下午我离开他的殡仪馆的时候，彼得已经拿到了我原本存在银行的一千美元支票，我也成了他殡葬生意的合伙人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I loved to see them on my desk, and think of the beloved back room down at Heffelbower's. But Louisa found them, and she shrieked with horror.

<div class="line_en">As you are aware, our contract for the year expires with the present month. While regretting the necessity for so doing, we must say that we do not care to renew same for the coming year. We were quite pleased with your style of humor, which seems to have delighted quite a large proportion of our readers. But for the past two months we have noticed a decided falling off in its quality. Your earlier work showed a spontaneous, easy, natural flow of fun and wit. Of late it is labored, studied, and unconvincing, giving painful evidence of hard toil and drudging mechanism.</div>
