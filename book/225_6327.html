<div class="line_en">The marriage-day was shining brightly, and they were ready outside the closed door of the Doctor's room, where he was speaking with Charles Darnay. They were ready to go to church; the beautiful bride, Mr. Lorry, and Miss Pross -- to whom the event, through a gradual process of reconcilement to the inevitable, would have been one of absolute bliss, but for the yet lingering consideration that her brother Solomon should have been the bridegroom.</div>

Now, my dear Lucie," drawing his arm soothingly round her waist, "I hear them moving in the next room, and Miss Pross and I, as two formal folks of business, are anxious not to lose the final opportunity of saying something to you that you wish to hear. You leave your good father, my dear, in hands as earnest and as loving as your own; he shall be taken every conceivable care of; during the next fortnight, while you are in Warwickshire and thereabouts, even Tellson's shall go to the wall (comparatively speaking) before him. And when, at the fortnight's end, he comes to join you and your beloved husband, on your other fortnight's trip in Wales, you shall say that we have sent him to you in the best health and in the happiest frame. Now, I hear Somebody's step coming to the door. Let me kiss my dear girl with an old-fashioned bachelor blessing, before Somebody comes to claim his own."</div>

<div class="line_en">He gave his arm to his daughter, and took her down-stairs to the chariot which Mr. Lorry had hired in honour of the day. The rest followed in another carriage, and soon, in a neighbouring church, where no strange eyes looked on, Charles Darnay and Lucie Manette were happily married.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他把手臂伸给了女儿，带她下了楼，进了罗瑞先生为祝贺这一天雇好的四轮轻便马车，其他的人坐在另一部车里随后。不久之后，查尔斯。达尔内和露西。曼内特便在附近的教堂里举行了幸福的婚礼，没有陌生的眼睛看热闹。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For a moment, he held the fair face from him to look at the well-remembered expression on the forehead, and then laid the bright golden hair against his little brown wig, with a genuine tenderness and delicacy which, if such things be old-fashioned, were as old as Adam.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他捧住那美丽的脸儿，推到一定的距离，观察她额上那令人难忘的表情，然后带着真诚的温柔和体贴把她那明亮的金发跟自己那褐色的小假发搂到了一起。如果这样做应当叫作老派的话，那么它就老得跟亚当一样了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The door of the Doctor's room opened, and he came out with Charles Darnay. He was so deadly pale -- which had not been the case when they went in together -- that no vestige of colour was to be seen in his face. But, in the composure of his manner he was unaltered, except that to the shrewd glance of Mr. Lorry it disclosed some shadowy indication that the old air of avoidance and dread had lately passed over him, like a cold wind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="门开了，医生和查尔斯。达尔内走了出来。医生脸色惨白，一丝血色也没有——他俩进屋去时他并不如此。但是，他态度镇定，神色如常，不过罗瑞先生精明的目光却也看出了一些模糊的迹象，表明过去的回避与畏惧的神气又曾如一道寒风在他身上刮过。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Besides the glancing tears that shone among the smiles of the little group when it was done, some diamonds, very bright and sparkling, glanced on the bride's hand, which were newly released from the dark obscurity of one of Mr. Lorry's pockets. They returned home to breakfast, and all went well, and in due course the golden hair that had mingled with the poor shoemaker's white locks in the Paris garret, were mingled with them again in the morning sunlight, on the threshold of the door at parting.</div>

It was when they turned into the welcome shade of the cool old hall, that Mr. Lorry observed a great change to have come over the Doctor; as if the golden arm uplifted there, had struck him a poisoned blow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那街角距离闲逛和好奇的人很远，婚礼的准备又极简单朴素，因此不一会儿工夫医生、罗瑞先生和普洛丝小姐就发现只剩下自己了。他们进人古老的厅堂那清凉可人的阴影中时，罗瑞先生注意到医生已发生了巨大的变化，仿佛高举在那儿的金胳膊给了他狠命的一击。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He had naturally repressed much, and some revulsion might have been expected in him when the occasion for repression was gone. But, it was the old scared lost look that troubled Mr. Lorry; and through his absent manner of clasping his head and drearily wandering away into his own room when they got up-stairs, Mr. Lorry was reminded of Defarge the wine-shop keeper, and the starlight ride.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他自然曾狠狠地压抑过自己，压抑一放松免不了会产生反弹。但叫罗瑞先生着急的却是他以往那副恐惧而茫然的样子又出现了。他们上楼时他那心不在焉地抱住头和凄凉地里进自己房间的模样使罗瑞先生想起了酒店老板德伐日和星光之下的马车旅行。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was easier for Mr. Lorry to look in at Tellson's, than to look out of Tellson's. He was detained two hours. When he came back, he ascended the old staircase alone, having asked no question of the servant; going thus into the Doctor's rooms, he was stopped by a low sound of knocking.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗瑞先生进台尔森容易，出来却难，他在那儿耽误了两个小时。回来时他没有向仆人询问情况就径直爬上了古老的楼梯，走进了医生的房间。一阵低低的敲打声却阻止了他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Nothing would induce him to speak more. He looked up, for an instant at a time, when he was requested to do so; but, no persuasion would extract a word from him. He worked, and worked, and worked, in silence, and words fell on him as they would have fallen on an echoless wall, or on the air. The only ray of hope that Mr. Lorry could discover, was, that he sometimes furtively looked up without being asked. In that, there seemed a faint expression of curiosity or perplexity -- as though he were trying to reconcile some doubts in his mind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="要让他多说一句话都是办不到的。要他抬头，他倒偶然抬头望望，但是无论怎样劝说，他也不说一句话。他老是干活儿，干活儿，干活儿，一声不响。话语落到他身上就像落到没有回声就墙壁上或是进入了虚空。罗瑞先生能够发现的仅有的希望是有时他会自己抬起头来，脸上似乎有一种好奇或惶感的表情——仿佛想回答心里的某些疑问。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Two things at once impressed themselves on Mr. Lorry, as important above all others; the first, that this must be kept secret from Lucie; the second, that it must be kept secret from all who knew him. In conjunction with Miss Pross, he took immediate steps towards the latter precaution, by giving out that the Doctor was not well, and required a few days of complete rest. In aid of the kind deception to be practised on his daughter, Miss Pross was to write, describing his having been called away professionally, and referring to an imaginary letter of two or three hurried lines in his own hand, represented to have been addressed to her by the same post.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗瑞先生感到有两件事比任何其它的事都重要：第一，一定要对露西保密；第二，一定要对所有认识他的人保密。他立即跟普洛丝小姐合作采取措施解决了第二个问题，对了外宣称医生身体欠安，需要彻底休养几天。为了对他的女儿进行善意的欺骗，普洛丝小姐必须写一封信去，说是医生到外地出诊去了，还提到他一封并不存在的亲笔信，说是只有潦潦草草的两三行与此信同一班邮车寄给她。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">These measures, advisable to be taken in any case, Mr. Lorry took in the hope of his coming to himself. If that should happen soon, he kept another course in reserve; which was, to have a certain opinion that he thought the best, on the Doctor's case.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the hope of his recovery, and of resort to this third course being thereby rendered practicable, Mr. Lorry resolved to watch him attentively, with as little appearance as possible of doing so.

<div class="line_en">Doctor Manette took what was given him to eat and drink, and worked on, that first day, until it was too dark to see -- worked on, half an hour after Mr. Lorry could not have seen, for his life, to read or write.

He remained, therefore, in his seat near the window, reading and writing, and expressing in as many pleasant and natural ways as he could think of, that it was a free place.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不久，他就发现跟医生说话不但无益而且有害，因为一逼他说话，他就烦恼，从第一天起他就放弃了那种打算，决定只让自已一直留在他面前，作为对他所落入或正要落入的幻觉的一种无声的对抗。因此他一直在窗前的座位上读书写字，而且用种种他想得出的自然而愉快的方式表示这屋子并不是牢房。">查看中文翻译</div>

He returned no reply, but it was evident that he heard what was said, and that he thought about it, however confusedly. This encouraged Mr. Lorry to have Miss Pross in with her work, several times during the day; at those times, they quietly spoke of Lucie, and of her father then present, precisely in the usual manner, and as if there were nothing amiss. This was done without any demonstrative accompaniment, not long enough, or often enough to harass him; and it lightened Mr. Lorry's friendly heart to believe that he looked up oftener, and that he appeared to be stirred by some perception of inconsistencies surrounding him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天罗瑞先生叫着他的名字向他欢欢喜喜打了个招呼，而且跟他谈起双方近来都熟悉的问题。他并未回答，但显然听见了他的话，而且思考着，尽管头脑不清楚。这就鼓舞了罗瑞先生。他让普洛丝小姐白天进屋好几趟来干家务活儿…那时他们很快地谈起露西，谈起露西的父亲（他就在旁边），跟平时完全一样，仿佛并无异常。这一切都做得很自然，并没有故意表现什么，每次时间很短，也不太频繁，不致令他心烦。罗瑞先生那友好的心感到了轻松，他相信医生抬头听他说话的次数增加了，也好像看出了周围有许多跟他的感觉不一致的东西，受到了刺激。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The time went very slowly on, and Mr. Lorry's hope darkened, and his heart grew heavier again, and grew yet heavier and heavier every day. The third day came and went, the fourth, the fifth. Five days, six days, seven days, eight days, nine days.</div>

<div class="line_en">With a hope ever darkening, and with a heart always growing heavier and heavier, Mr. Lorry passed through this anxious time. The secret was well kept, and Lucie was unconscious and happy; but he could not fail to observe that the shoemaker, whose hand had been a little out at first, was growing dreadfully skilful, and that he had never been so intent on his work, and that his hands had never been so nimble and expert, as in the dusk of the ninth evening.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗瑞先生带着日益渺茫的希望和越来越沉重的心情度过了这段好不令人焦灼的日子。两人守口如瓶，露西很快乐，一点也没有觉察。但是罗瑞先生却不能不注意到那鞋匠多少已经生疏的双手又变得可怕地熟练起来，而且到了第九天的黄昏，他不但比以往任何时候都更热中于工作，而且那双手也比以往任何时候都灵巧熟练了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This time, Mr. Lorry feigned to go out when he could extract no answer from him, and, after remaining absent for an hour, returned. In the meanwhile, the Doctor had removed to the seat in the window, and had sat there looking down at the plane-tree; but, on Mr. Lorry's return, he slipped away to his bench.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一次罗瑞先生在诱导他回答失败之后就假装出门去了。他在外面呆了一个小时才回来。在这段时间里医生已来到窗户下的座位上坐下，望着窗下的梧桐树。但罗瑞先生一回来，他又悄悄溜回原来的凳子边去了。">查看中文翻译</div>
