<div class="line_en">Yesterday, I heard a car engine getting closer, and climbed up to hide in the beams of the patched roof. But the men just looked in quickly through the worn-out windows and broken doors before they left. I clung to the dusty wooden beam, feeling it would bend under my weight, and tried to make no noise. My arms and legs grew numb, then began to tremble. I longed to move, but I waited until I heard the policemen drive off.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="昨天，我听到一个汽车引擎声越来越近，于是爬上车躲进补丁屋顶的横梁里。但是在他们离开之前，这些人只是从破旧的窗户和破碎的门里快速地往里看。我紧紧抓住积满灰尘的木梁，感觉它会被我的重量压弯，尽量不发出声音。我的胳膊和腿麻木了，然后开始发抖。我很想动一下，但我一直等到警车开走了才敢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I know that they will return. When we began the final part of our journey, we were warned that the police patrolled the land around here regularly. They are always searching for us, or others like us; the coast of Morocco and the Presidio of Ceuta are only ten miles away across the Straits.</div>

<div class="line_en">That is how I got here: squeezed in with fifteen other men in a shallow boat meant for eight, with the cold waves reaching over the sides and the night deep and black as a tomb. I have never been more scared. I prayed all the way across, and thought about my family. I told myself, over and over, that I was doing it for them. That trip took almost all of my money. All of the money I had saved in Ecuador. The boatmen left us on a beach in the middle of the night. We lost sight of them but we could still hear their small engine across the waves. Six of us started walking inland but the others waited for the contacts, the friends of the boatmen, as they had been told.</div>

<div class="line_en">We were lucky: we met Paulo. We found the town and waited until the first bar opened; I went in alone while the others hid in the orchard nearby. When I asked for a cup of coffee, the young barman looked at me and nodded. He made the coffee, then disappeared into the back room. Cold and without strength, I wrapped my hands around the warm cup, not caring whether the barman had called the police, not caring about the next moment, just about the present.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们很幸运：我们遇到了 Paulo。我们找到了小镇，一直等到第一家酒吧开门；我一个人进去，其他人躲在附近的果园里。当我要一杯咖啡时，年轻的酒保看着我点了点头。他煮了咖啡，然后消失在后面的房间里。寒冷而没有力量，我裹着我的手放在温暖的杯子上，不在乎酒保是否报了警，不在乎下一刻，只在乎现在。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But the man had called Paulo, who came and helped us. Paulo was always smiling, always happy. He was from Seville, a busy city of many people, and he knew many people. Paulo found work for us. I made good money on the farms. I picked cabbages, beans, cucumbers and peas. I picked great round yellow squashes that smelled of rich perfume when you broke them. The farmers hired us by the day, and were content. The local people would never work for the wages we are paid. But there were many farms, and many crops to be picked. We were welcomed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是那个人给保罗打了电话，保罗来帮助了我们。保罗总是面带微笑，总是很开心。他来自塞维利亚，那是一个人口众多的繁忙城市，他认识很多人。保罗为我们找到了工作。我在农场上赚了不少钱。我采了卷心菜，豆子，黄瓜和豌豆。我摘了一些很棒的黄色南瓜，当你打碎它们的时候，它们散发着浓郁的香味。农民们每天雇用我们，他们很满意。当地人决不会为了我们的工资而工作。但是那里有许多农场，还有许多可以采摘的庄稼。我们受到了欢迎。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I shared a small clean house in the town with seven other workers. We had journeyed from Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, even Argentina. Paulo found the house for us -- he knew the landlord and arranged a good price. We lived well, with enough food and sometimes wine. I earned more in a week than I could in three months back home if there had been work to do there. I sent most of the money that was left to my wife and parents, and wrote many letters to them. Then the government changed the rules so that we needed work permits.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我和另外七个工人一起住在镇上一个干净的小房子里。我们从厄瓜多尔、哥伦比亚、委内瑞拉甚至阿根廷旅行过。保罗为我们找到了房子——他认识房东，并且安排了一个好价钱。我们生活得很好，有足够的食物，有时还有酒。如果有工作要做的话，我一个星期挣的钱比回家三个月挣的钱还多。我把剩下的大部分钱都寄给了我的妻子和父母，并给他们写了很多信。后来政府改变了规定，我们需要工作许可证。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I queued with hundreds of other workers, waiting for the application forms. We sat on the stone benches beneath the trees and read the forms. Some of the other workers are from small villages and towns, and cannot read as well as I can, so I explained to them that the government wanted our birth certificates, driving licenses, passports and many other documents. Many of the workers had perhaps one or two of these documents, but most had none. I helped the others complete the forms and we gave them to the clerk. He looked at our documents, stamped the forms many times and told us that they would be sent to Madrid, and our permits would be returned in two or three months if the forms were approved.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我和其他几百名工人一起排队等候申请表。我们坐在树下的石凳上，阅读形式。其他一些工人来自小村庄和城镇，不能像我一样阅读，所以我向他们解释说，政府想要我们的出生证明，驾驶执照，护照和许多其他文件。许多工人可能有一个或两个这样的文件，但大多数没有。我帮助其他人完成了表格，我们把它们交给了职员。他看了我们的文件，在表格上多次盖章，并告诉我们，这些表格将送到马德里，如果表格得到批准，我们的许可证将在两三个月内退回。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The first month was not too bad as most of the farmers continued to use us; their crops were rich, waiting to be picked.

<div class="line_cn" title="第一个月还不算太糟，因为大多数农民继续使用我们；他们的庄稼很丰富，等待采摘。然后一些来自马德里的男人参观了所有的农场，也许一半的农民不再使用我们。农民们告诉我们他们很抱歉，我们理解他们。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So the second month was worse: only a few of the farmers would use us, and those that did pay very poor wages. We shared what we had, and ate once a day: rice, porridge, bread, cheap food that would fill our stomachs. We began to stare at each other, and wonder which of us would find work. There were fights in the morning, between different groups of workers, when the farms' supervisors came to choose who would work that day. But still we had some hope.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以第二个月更糟糕：只有少数农民愿意雇用我们，而那些确实支付非常低的工资的农民。我们分享我们所拥有的，每天吃一次：大米，粥，面包，能填饱我们肚子的便宜食物。我们开始互相凝视，想知道谁能找到工作。当农场的主管来挑选当天的工作人员时，上午不同工人群体之间发生了争斗。但我们仍然抱有一些希望。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We lost the house in the third month, as we had no money for rent. We were able to get some food from the charity kitchens around the town, and the church, but we found always a long queue and very little food. We took our bags and blankets and slept in the fields. Then the weather became cold and we slept where we could, huddled together, in old forgotten buildings and alleys. Sometimes I dreamed of my family, and when I awoke, I wished the dream could continue.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们在第三个月失去了房子，因为我们没有钱付房租。我们可以从镇上的慈善厨房和教堂里得到一些食物，但是我们发现总是有很长的队伍和很少的食物。我们拿上包和毯子，在田野里睡觉。然后天气变冷了，我们就在那些被遗忘的老房子和小巷里挤作一团睡觉。有时我会梦见我的家人，当我醒来时，我希望这个梦能继续下去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The people of the town stared at us from the sides of their eyes as they passed us. They clenched their hands and muttered, and some of them spat on the pavement. A few of us were attacked and beaten in the dark, and driven from the parks and streets. All of the time, the Police told us to move on, move on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当镇上的人们从我们身边经过时，他们的眼睛从两侧注视着我们。他们握紧双手，喃喃自语，有些人还在人行道上吐口水。我们中的一些人在黑暗中受到攻击和殴打，被赶出了公园和街道。一直以来，警察都告诉我们要向前看，向前看。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You have the permit?"he asked me. He was broad, stout and filled the doorway of the coach. His fat neck spilt from the upturned collar of his leather jacket. His hair was shaven close to his head. I explain to him that my application was rejected but I would try again.</div>
