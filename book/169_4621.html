Do not trouble to deny it. You began to dance attendance on Maid Margaery before Ser Loras went to Dragonstone, so spare me further fables about how you want only to console our good-daughter in her grief.

<div class="line_en">"… not of his blood." Cersei dismissed that annoyance with a flick of her hand. "Gyles knew of our dire need for gold. No doubt he told you of his wish to leave all his lands and wealth to Tommen." Rosby's gold would help refresh their coffers, and Rosby's lands and castle could be bestowed upon one of her own as a reward for leal service. Lord Waters, perhaps. Aurane had been hinting at his need for a seat; his lordship was only an empty honor without one. He had his eye on Dragonstone, Cersei knew, but there he aimed too high. Rosby would be more suitable to his birth and station.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“…此人不是他的血脉，”瑟曦挥挥手，表示不在意这点小麻烦，“盖尔斯最清楚我们当下资金的缺口有多大，毫无疑问，他临终前会把自己的领地和财富统统捐献给托曼国王。”罗斯比的金子可解燃眉之急，罗斯比的领地和城堡则可封赏给效忠她的人。或许，就赏给维水大人吧。奥雷恩曾暗示想要有座家堡，否则伯爵只是个虚衔——他盯着龙石岛呢，但瑟曦不会把这个给他，罗斯比城更适合他的出身与地位。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The little queen has appetites that Tommen is as yet too young to satisfy." That was always a danger, when a grown woman was married to a child. Even more so with a widow. She may claim that Renly never touched her, but I will not believe it. Women only drank moon tea for one reason; maidens had no need for it at all. "My son has been betrayed. Margaery has a lover. That is high treason, punishable by death." She could only hope that Mace Tyrell's prune-faced harridan of a mother lived long enough to see the trial. By insisting that Tommen and Margaery be wed at once, Lady Olenna had condemned her precious rose to a headsman's sword. "Jaime made off with Ser Ilyn Payne. I suppose I shall need to find a new King's Justice to snick her head off."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“咱们的小王后嫌托曼太‘小’了吧。”教成年女人嫁给孩子，总是会发生这种事。对寡妇而言就更要命了。她说蓝礼没碰她，我可不信。月茶对女人来说只有一个用途，反正处女是绝不需要的。“我儿子被人欺骗了。玛格丽有了情人。这是叛国，理当处死。”她希望玛格丽·提利尔那老不死的丑陋祖母能亲眼目睹这场审判——你以为逼托曼尽快迎娶玛格丽就是高招？哼，你把你心爱的小玫瑰送上了断头台。“詹姆把伊林·派恩带走了，我们得再找个刽子手。”">查看中文翻译</div>
