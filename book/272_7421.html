<div class="line_en">It got to the point where Mrs. Thompson would actually take delight in making his papers with a broad red pen, making bold Xs and then putting a "F" at the top of his papers. At the school where Mrs. Thompson taught, she was required to relieve each child's past records and she put Teddy's off until last.</div>

<div class="line_en">But that was impossible because there in the front row, slumped in his seat, was a little boy named Teddy Stoddard.</div>

<div class="line_en">There is a story from many years ago of a primary school teacher. Her name was Mrs. Thompson. And as she stood in front of the 5th grade class on the very first day of school, she told the children a lie. Like most teachers, she looked her students and said that she loved them all the same.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个故事说的是多年前一名叫汤普森夫人的小学老师，在开学第一天的时候，她站在五年级全班学生面前，对孩子们撒了一个谎。像大多数老师一样，她看着同学们，说她会一视同仁地爱他们每一个人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">However, when she relieved his file, she was in a surprise, Teddy's first grade teacher wrote,"Teddy is a bright child with a ready laugh. He does his work neatly and has good manners… he is a joy to be around."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是，她翻阅特迪的档案时，不禁大吃一惊。特迪一年级老师的评语是：“特迪是一个聪明的孩子，笑口常开，作业工整，礼貌待人……与他在一起很开心。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他四年级老师的评语是：“特迪性格孤僻，有厌学情绪。他朋友不多，有时候上课睡觉。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">By now, Mrs. Thompson realized the problem and she was ashamed of herself. She felt even worse when her students brought her Christmas presents, wrapped in beautiful paper and tied with pretty ribbons, except for Teddy's. His present was clumsily wrapped in the heavy, brown paper that he got from a grocery bag.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看到这里，汤普森夫人明白了问题所在，她为自己感到羞愧。当同学们送给她圣诞礼物时，她更无地自容了。那些礼物都用漂亮的包装纸包着，扎着美丽的彩带，惟有特迪的例外。他的礼物是用杂货袋上弄下来的厚厚的棕色纸粗陋地包着的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His third grade teacher wrote, "His mother's death has been hard on him. He tried to do his best but his father doesn't show much interest in him, and his home life will steps aren't taken."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他三年级老师的评语是：“他母亲去世对他打击很大。尽管他试图努力表现，但他父亲不大理会，家庭问题失控加剧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mrs. Thompson opened it in the middle of the other presents. Some of the children started to laugh when she found a rhinestone bracelet with some of the stones missing, and a bottle that was one-quarter full of perfume. But she stifled the children's laughter when she exclaimed how pretty the bracelet was, putting it on, and dabbing some of the perfume on her wrist. Teddy stayed after school that day just long enough to say, "Mrs. Thompson, today you smelled just like my mom used to."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在一堆礼物中间，汤普森夫人拆开了特迪送的礼物。当她看到里面放的是一串少了珠子的莱茵石手镯，还有1/4瓶香水的时候，有些孩子开始笑出声来。汤普森夫人制止了孩子们的嘲笑，并大声赞叹手镯是多么漂亮。她戴上手镯，还在手腕处喷了点儿香水。那天放学以后，特迪·斯托达德留下来对汤普森夫人说：“汤普森夫人，您今天身上的味道像我妈妈。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mrs. Thompson paid particular attention to Teddy. As she worked with him, his mind seemed to come alive. The more she encouraged him, the faster he responded. By the end of the year, Teddy had become one of the smartest children in the class.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="孩子们走后，她哭了至少一个小时。也从那天起，她不再单纯教阅读、写作和算术，而是开始教孩子们如何做人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Four years after that, she got another letter, saying that he would soon graduate from college with the highest of honors. Then four more years past and yet another letter came. This time he explained that after he got his bachelor's degree, he decided to go a little further. The letter explained that she was still the best and favorite teacher he ever had. But now his name was a little longer-the letter was signed, Theodore F. Stoddard, MD.</div>

<div class="line_en">At the wedding ceremony, they hugged each other, and Dr. Stoddard whispered in Mrs. Thompson's ear, "Thank you Mrs. Thompson for believing in me, thank you so much for making me feel important and showing me that I could make a difference."</div>

<div class="line_en">The story doesn't end there. You see, there was yet another letter that spring. Teddy said he'd met his girl and was going to be married. He explained that his father had died a couple of yeas ago and he was wondering if Mrs. Thompson might agree to sit in the place at the wedding that was usually reserved for the mother of the groom. Of course Mrs. Thompson did.</div>
