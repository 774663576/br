But at about five o'clock Friday afternoon I agreed with him about one thing -- we should've barbecued. A barbecue is more, you know, low-key.

<div class="line_en">This is not the way you want to feel about your father. When I was little, I'd always thought that my dad was right about everything and that there wasn't a man on earth he couldn't take. But standing there looking in, I realized that Mr. Baker could squash him like a bug.</div>

<div class="line_en">You know, civil? Why did he have to put on such a phony show? This went way beyond keeping the peace with my mother. This was disgusting.
