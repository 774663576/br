<div class="line_en">He was thinking all the time that the subject of his desire was being delayed. He was anxious to turn the talk to his own feelings. All was ripe for it. His Carrie was beside him. He wanted to plunge in and expostulate with her, and yet he found himself fishing for words and feeling for a way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这期间他一直在想，他现在这样是在推迟实现自己的欲望。他急于要把谈话引到他的情感上去。现在时机已经成熟了，他的嘉莉正走在他身旁。他想直截了当地劝嘉莉离开杜洛埃，但是不知道该如何措辞，还在思索怎么开口的问题。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He took his lower lip between his teeth for a moment, and then let it go. He stopped by the walk side and kicked the grass with his toe. He searched her face with a tender, appealing glance.</div>

<div class="line_en">And yet she was not without thoughts which were disturbing. What did he know? What had Drouet told him? Was she a wife in his eyes, or what? Would he marry her? Even while he talked, and she softened, and her eyes were lighted with a tender glow, she was asking herself if Drouet had told him they were not married. There was never anything at all convincing about what Drouet said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是她还有令人不安的担心。关于她，他知道些什么？杜洛埃和他说了些什么？在他眼里，她是别人的妻子呢，还是别的什么？他会娶她吗？他的话使她心软，她的眼睛不觉露出温情脉脉的光辉。但是在他说话的时候，她心里一直在想，杜洛埃是不是已经告诉他，他们并没有结婚。杜洛埃的话总是让人不敢相信。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As a matter of fact, she was in a most hopeless quandary. Here was a man whom she thoroughly liked, who exercised an influence over her, sufficient almost to delude her into the belief that she was possessed of a lively passion for him. She was still the victim of his keen eyes, his suave manners, his fine clothes. She looked and saw before her a man who was most gracious and sympathetic, who leaned toward her with a feeling that was a delight to observe. She could not resist the glow of his temperament, the light of his eye. She could hardly keep from feeling what he felt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="事实上，她正陷入进退两难的困境。眼前这男人是她非常喜欢的。他对她的影响之大，足以使她误以为自己对他一往情深。他的敏锐的目光，温文尔雅的举止和考究精美的衣服仍然让她昏头。她觉得眼前这个男人非常和蔼可亲，富于同情心，对她非常倾心，这份情意令人欣喜。她无法抗拒他的气质和他的明亮的眼睛。她几乎无法不产生和他同样的感觉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don't know," returned Carrie, still illogically drifting and finding nothing at which to catch.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不知道，”嘉莉回答。她思绪仍然很乱，游移不定，不知如何是好。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And yet she was not grieved at Hurstwood's love. No strain of bitterness was in it for her, whatever he knew. He was evidently sincere. His passion was real and warm. There was power in what he said. What should she do? She went on thinking this, answering vaguely, languishing affectionately, and altogether drifting, until she was on a borderless sea of speculation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过她并不为赫斯渥的爱情感到担心。不管他知道些什么，他对她的爱没有一点勉强或苦涩。他显然是诚挚的，他的爱真切而热烈，他的话让人信服。她该怎么办呢？她继续这么想着，含糊地回答着，情意绵绵地痛苦着，总的来说她在犹豫不决，陷入了无边无际的臆测之海。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a look of confusion and pain in her face. She was wondering why that miserable thought must be brought in. She was struck as by a blade with the miserable provision which was outside the pale of marriage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的脸上露出狼狈和痛苦的表情。她想，为什么要提出这个令人难堪的话题。这种婚姻以外靠男人赡养的可悲生活像刀一样刺痛了她的心。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He himself realized that it was a wretched thing to have dragged in. He wanted to weigh the effects of it, and yet he could not see. He went beating on, flushed by her presence, clearly awakened, intensely enlisted in his plan.</div>

<div class="line_en">The manager looked at his lovely prize, so beautiful, so winsome, so difficult to be won, and made strange resolutions. His passion had gotten to that stage now where it was no longer coloured with reason. He did not trouble over little barriers of this sort in the face of so much loveliness. He would accept the situation with all its difficulties; he would not try to answer the objections which cold truth thrust upon him. He would promise anything, everything, and trust to fortune to disentangle him. He would make a try for Paradise, whatever might be the result. He would be happy, by the Lord, if it cost all honesty of statement, all abandonment of truth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="经理看着他可爱的情人，那么美丽，那么迷人，又那么难以到手，他就下了荒唐的决心。他的欲火已经到了不再受理智左右的地步。面对着如此美色，他已经顾不得这一类的小小障碍。不管有多少困难，他也不会退却。他不打算去回答冷酷的事实摆在他面前的难题。他什么都答应，一切的一切他都答应。让命运去解决这些难题吧。他要千方百计进入爱的乐园，不管前面有什么结果等着他。天哪，他一定要得到幸福，哪怕需要他说谎，哪怕要他不顾事实。">查看中文翻译</div>
