<div class="line_en">Back in Poli, All was quiet. At the mission there was a brooding silence. Jon's crops had been ravaged by unidentified beasts. The town-chief's cattle were deeply suspected. Somehow. I felt sure it was baboons. Had Jon's wife been a Dowayo lady, she would have expected to be beaten for adultery -- the inevitable cause of damage to a man's crops.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the village, Zuuldibo, when unearthed from under my bed, proclaimed that preparations were continuing for the circumcision but that nothing interesting could happen for some time yet. I knew from previous experience that it was the brewing of the beer that would be the real point of no return. When I heard that it was brewing, I would know that the time had come. Just to make sure, I sent Matthieu over to the village where it was to be held with a present of tobacco for one of his relatives who lived there. They would be sure to send word in good time.</div>

<div class="line_en">From one of the male nurses at the hospital, I had learned that the chief of the Ninga was in Poli and resolved to track him down. It took hours of wandering round the outlying huts. Once again, it was clear to everyone what a white man wanted despite his protestations and pathetic pretences. I had not previously realized that commercial vice existed as such in such a small town. But exist it certainly did and I was tirelessly offered most of it. There was also an awkward encounter with a member of the police who emerged from one compound in a dishevelled state and explained with great insistence that he was investigating illegal drinking.</div>

<div class="line_en">We seated ourselves on two upturned crates and we began our audience, the urchin acting as interpreter. I announced my delight at seeing the chief and explained my mission in these parts was to study 'customs'. He nodded sagely. I had heard many interesting things about the Ninga and my heart longed to visit him in his village to learn about Ninga ways. On the whole this approach seemed preferable to simply saying, 'Look, about male nipples…'</div>

<div class="line_en">It was only at nightfall, tired, hot and deeply resentful, that I finally discovered the chief of the Ninga, being beckoned into his presence by an urchin I had hired as a guide. Clearly his avoidance techniques were every bit as good as Zuuldibo's. The chief was a dwarf, clothed entirely in a bright red robe of thick flannel rather like Father Christmas's assistants. From under the robe, peeked out saucily the toes of glossy white shoes. As I entered his compound, he rushed at me rather like an over-enthusiastic terrier, hugged me fiercely, burying his face in my stomach, and declared his joy at seeing me.</div>

<div class="line_en">He smiled benevolently at the translation of my words. He had heard of me among the Dowayos -- always his friends. His heart yearned to take me to his village. He would gladly discuss with me Ninga ways. He had heard that I was a man of straight words. He looked coy. There was only one problem. He was a poor man. He could not entertain me as I would wish. Yet he was proud. He could not bear to receive me and disappoint my expectations. He sighed. There was only one way round it. I would have to buy a goat. A thousand francs would be quite sufficient. I might as well pass over the money now. I baulked. This was as straightforward a demand for cash as I had ever encountered. It was difficult to know whether this was a moment appropriate to no-nonsense, man-to-man toughness or to spontaneous generosity, devoid of haggling. Anthropology, alas, requires always a measure of hypocrisy and calculation. A swift check of my pockets revealed a total of some five hundred francs so generosity was out.</div>

<div class="line_en">Alas, I explained, I too was a poor man. Not being a chief, I was unaccustomed to eating whole goats, so I would give the chief the price of half a goat -- five hundred francs. He looked very disappointed. Having come so far and discovered a phenomenon as vital as the excision of male nipples, it seemed ridiculous to haggle over slightly more than a pound. Somehow, this was an argument I always used on myself before giving in. I added that I would, of course, expect to give the chief a present when I visited him. 'A guest does not come with empty hands.'</div>

<div class="line_en">Nine days later, there had been no further sign from the chief of the Ninga. African notions of time are somewhat looser than our own.

<div class="line_en">It was difficult to know quite how to respond to that. Having just been parted from all my money, I did not feel particularly clever, so we let the matter lie.

<div class="line_en">The chief brightened visibly and we agreed that in a week's time our urchin interpreter would come to the village to fetch me and we would climb the mountain together.

<div class="line_en">The compact figure of the sous-préfet was already crouched over his desk, a stack of papers spread out before him. As we shook hands, a broad grin spread over his face.

<div class="line_en">Still, it looked as though a visit to the chief of the nippleless Ninga would not go amiss. I set off with Matthieu as soon as it got light -- he predicting doom as usual. Once more we had to go through a great deal of wandering about. In polygynous households there is often a nomadic element in sleeping arrangements.

<div class="line_en">The conversation got round to the subject of circumcision. The sous-préfet's approach was plagued by all the unresolved discomforts of any administrator from one culture who rules over members of another. As a Muslim, he, of course, regarded circumcision as a good thing in itself. It was inherently civilizing and was therefore to be encouraged among the pagans. He was aware, however, that it was disruptive, dangerous and expensive. He was therefore in the habit of sending out the male nurses to perform the operation in the villages, instead of letting the local people do it, 'with a dirty hoe'. They were at least more moderate in their excisions and relatively hygienic, though the stipulation that all wounds be doused in alcohol must have greatly increased the pain involved. What the sous-préfet did not know was that some of the elders, dissatisfied with this arrangement, circumcised the boys a second time once the nurses had left: humanitarian measures of a good administrator had thus greatly increased the pain, suffering and mortality of the boys -- in the best traditions of colonial rule.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="话题转到割礼。身为统治异文化子民的行政官，无法释怀的不安感破坏了副县长的割礼措施。他是穆斯林，当然认为割礼是好事。割礼的本质乃教化之事，应在异教徒间广为推动，但他也知道割包皮危险且昂贵。因此他习惯派遣男护上到村落里帮人割包皮，以免当地居民用“肮脏锄头”乱搞。男护士做的包皮割除手术比较温和，也比较卫生，但是他规定伤口必须以酒精清洗，显然会大大增加疼痛程度。副县长不知道许多多瓦悠长者不满意此种安排，在护士离去后，又给男孩割了一次包皮。因此行政官的人道之举却大大增加男孩的疼痛、受苦，甚至死亡率提高——完全符合殖民统治的传统。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The more I denied it, the more he delightedly refused to believe anything but the worst of me. We finally got round to the question of the chief of the Ninga. 'The chief of the Ninga? But I can tell you where he is.' He leaned back in his chair and assumed his most cherubic expression. 'I sent him back to his village. He is a bad example, lying around in town, drinking, fornicating. How are young men to respect their chiefs with such behaviour? I have sent him back to collect the tax properly.' He waved a reproachful finger at me. 'You had better behave yourself or I will be sending you back to yours.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我越是否认，他越是兴高采烈拒绝釆信。我们终于谈到尼加酋长的事。“尼加酋长？我可以告诉你他上哪儿去了。”他往椅背一靠，露出天真无邪的表情：“我勒令他回村子去。他是个坏榜样，成日在镇上鬼混、喝酒、通奸。酋长这个样子，叫族里的年轻人如何尊敬他？我叫他回村子，乖乖给我收税去。”他谴责地朝我摇摇手指：“你最好守规矩点，否则我也送你回自己的村子。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One of the principles of the British Army has always been, 'When in doubt -- Charge!' It seemed the moment to apply it to my own fieldwork. Zuuldibo confirmed that several men in the village knew the paths to the Ninga which involved dangerous climbing. He would send me one who was strong, intelligent, honest and so on. I resolved to leave at first light for the Ninga. Matthieu was much displeased. If Ninga in town had been bad enough, Ninga up a mountain were even worse. 'It is the wrong season to climb the mountain,' he declared. 'It will rain. We shall be washed off. There will be no drinking-water.'</div>

<div class="line_en">It was during this talk that I first heard of the water project that was to prove a major problem of the future. The sous-préfet, in collaboration with the American Peace Corps, had determined that the town needed a pure water supply. As I walked back to my village, I little realized what a tangled issue this would become. I was more interested in my search for the missing mastectomy.</div>

<div class="line_en">The next morning, before daybreak, there was a polite coughing outside my hut too genteel to be that of a goat. Outside stood a shivering waif in torn shorts and a magnificent red Beatles hat. In his hand, he bore a pet bird of many colours, not a parrot but rather resembling a kingfisher. It was the guide Zuuldibo had sent -- a boy of about eight. We drank coffee and sat on the cold rocks talking. It appeared that the boy's mother was Ninga -- married to a Dowayo man -- and that he had served on a number of cattle drives from the high plateau to the valley. His knowledge was not to be called into question. With some difficulty Matthieu was roused. An hour later, we set off with camera, notebooks, tobacco -- all the standard elements of the ethnographic trade.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="翌日，天未破晓，我的茅屋外传来一声轻咳，彬彬有礼，绝不可能是山羊咳嗽。门外是个穿着破烂短裤、浑身冻得发抖的流浪儿戴了一顶非常棒的红色“披头士”帽子。他手上站着一只色彩斑斓的宠物鸟，不是鹦鹉，像是翠鸟鱼狗。他就是祖帝保派来的向导一八岁小孩。我们喝咖啡、坐在冰冷石头上聊天。原来，男孩的妈妈是尼加人，嫁给多瓦悠男人，他曾好几次参与赶牛队伍，从高原赶到山谷。因此，他的知识不容怀疑。我好不容易把马修挖起来。一小时后，我们带着相机、笔记本、烟草——全是人类学这行的基本配备——出发前往尼加村。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After half an hour, we met a party bound for a funeral beyond Kongle. They bore bubbling pots of beer and dry, crackling cattle-skins to wrap the corpse and were clearly in high good spirits at the prospect of meat from the cattle that would be slaughtered. I was glad that Zuuldibo had not come with us. He would never have allowed the beer to pass untasted. The 'mourners' made cheerful jokes about my constant attendance, vulture-like, at Dowayo funerals. We exchanged tobacco for mountain bananas and they went on their way puffing happily -- the cigarettes being rolled in a page of my notebook. Our little guide fed some banana to his bird, set it back on his cap at a festive tilt and we began to climb.</div>

Startled cattle would suddenly loom up out of the mist and crash off snorting into the long grass.

<div class="line_en">The climb is not pleasant. The path is often very narrow, its thin, crumbly edges sloping down towards the rocks below. When wet‚ the granite is very slippery and unforgiving towards anyone who loses his footing. As we climbed, drops of heavy dew slithered coldly down our necks and arms whenever we touched the vegetation that sprouted rankly in the crevices. Soon, we came upon a deep cleft littered with broken bottles and smashed calabashes. Our small guide paused here and pointed it out as a place where dwelt a strong spirit of the earth and urged us to make an offering of any food we were carrying. I gave up a banana and a piece of chocolate, Matthieu somewhat grudgingly yielded up a pinch of instant coffee and some smoked meat that he had secreted in the bottom of his pack against contingencies. Our guide nodded approvingly and set off again, the bird bobbing and shuffling as he heaved himself over the rocks.

I nodded agreement. He would assign a hut to Matthieu and myself and we should meet later in the evening when I had rested. There was just one small problem. I had paid for half a goat when we had met in the town. It was impossible, however, to kill just half a goat. Could I perhaps see my way clear to paying for the other half?

As I struggled to my feet, I saw Matthieu, out of the corner of my eye, mouthing distaste. Two bottles of shop-bought beer were produced. After a little pantomime between Matthieu and myself as to whether we should share a bottle, a third bottle was summoned forth and was given, to the chief's visible distress, to Matthieu.

The roof beams, eaten away by termites on one side, had collapsed and the whole rotting thatch hung down over the walls, leaving the other side bare. I hoped it would not rain. Our young guide made his farewells, but promised to return later that day to act as interpreter. 'Before you go,' I asked, 'how many Ninga are there?'

In the past they had been more numerous. There had been disease. Some had moved following a disagreement. Some had intermarried with other peoples. Fulani families had installed themselves around the Ninga to take advantage of the dry-season grazing for there was always water up the mountain. Many of the empty compounds we had seen belonged to Fulani who were away with their cattle. It seemed that in a very few years, the Ninga would be no more.</div>

<div class="line_en">At dinner that evening with the chief our promised goat was indeed produced. Unfortunately, there are goats and goats. Young goats are tender and succulent. Female goats can be good though stringy eating. Old male goats are quite a different matter. Male goats are so malodorous that it is possible when going along a mountain path to tell whether a male goat has passed that way within the last ten minutes. The flesh of a male goat is imbued with a taste of old armpits. Few spices are pungent enough even to attenuate its odour. The taste comes through loud and clear.</div>

<div class="line_en">This all came as rather a blow. It is true that some of the peoples studied by anthropologists in South America are scarcely more numerous. Disease, dispossession and warfare have reduced them to tiny fragments of their former selves. To work on a people as depleted as this would be as much a work of archaeology as of anthropology. Given the importance of the missing mastectomy, it was as well that I was there at such a critical moment. For when a people loses its identity what the anthropologist regrets most is the loss of a unique vision of the world, the product of thousands of years of interaction and thought. Hereafter our view of the range of human possibilities is diminished. The anthropological importance of a people has nothing to do with numbers.</div>

It was fortunate, indeed, that there were many Fulani near his village since -- he said -- they were great herdsmen. Their cattle gave good milk for drinking, unlike the dwarf cattle of the Dowayos. Moreover, it kept fresh since the Fulani ladies urinated in it to prevent curdling. Thereafter, I drank less than before.</div>

There were constant movements of cattle through the compound, sidling moodily first in one direction and then the other. It began to rain in great, wet. sticky drops. Matthieu and I huddled up at one end of the hut while cattle thudded and banged against the walls outside and a steadily growing puddle of water advanced across the floor towards us. Finally, the grass mat closing off the doorway of the hut was burst in and a mêlée of frantic goats crowded in to get out of the rain. From the stench, it was clear that they were preponderantly male. The village clearly specialized in male goats. Possibly this hut was a habitual haunt of theirs and we were the interlopers. Our shouts and blows failed to move them. We were rewarded with a tossing of wicked-looking horns and a stamping of hooves. We raged at them. They glared malevolently at us.

I paid them only passing heed. In the hunt for the missing mastectomy, it seemed especially important to avoid leading questions. I wanted unsolicited data and so Matthieu and I sat and watched and waited. At the first group of ancestral skulls, all apparently split with an axe, luck smiled on us. In common with many other pagan groups of the area, the Ninga undress to approach the sacred. As he limped along to the remains of his forefathers, the chief slipped off his long, shapeless robe. There, finally, for all the world to see, were two flat discoloured patches where male nipples should have been. I confess to a moment of great glee which Matthieu was incapable of sharing.

The toes and fingers, it seemed, were particularly prone to cause trouble in 'old men' -- anyone over forty. The drastic response of the afflicted was often simply to lop off troublesome joints with an axe or hoe. In his readings of the previous night‚ Matthieu had come across the passage: 'If thy hand offend thee‚ cut it off.' He could not understand how ignorant pagans such as the Ninga had adopted a practice clearly derived from knowledge of the Bible when they were still rooted in unmitigated heathendom. The problem seemed to become a sort of obsession with him, challenging the sharp line he had drawn between bad, old heathen ways and good, new Christian ways. He expounded the difficulty to me while the chief was muttering and whispering to the dead and sloshing beer over the skulls. We seemed like a ridiculous model of the world in microcosm. The pagan fussed over his skulls, oblivious to my obsession with male nipples, while Matthieu's religion was challenged by amputated fingers and toes.

<div class="line_en">As we walked back to the huts, I tried to work the subject round to amputations via questions on circumcision, hoping to find evidence that the Ninga connected them in their minds. Had the chief given me a full description? Yes. Was there nothing he had left out? No. What about the scarification of the body?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="返回茅屋途中，我试图迂回试探此一问题，从割礼谈到切除，希望发现尼加人的思维里是将这两件事联结在一起。您对仪式的描述完整吗？是的。有没什么遗漏的地方？没有。身体的牺牲呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Dowayos, for example, often cut geometric patterns in their skin. Did the Ninga do this? No, they only cut off fingers and toes. (Matthieu looked downcast.) Did the Ninga perhaps file their teeth at circumcision? Perhaps some did. At this point, we encountered a bare-breasted woman who was introduced as the chief's sister. Her breasts too appeared to have undergone surgery. A horrible truth began to dawn. Throwing discretion to the winds, I indicated her breasts. Had she been born with breasts like this or (cunningly) had this been done to make her more beautiful? Everyone laughed. Of course she had been born like this. Who would cut their breasts? Such a thing would be painful.</div>

<div class="line_en">We were led across the village to a compound even more decrepit than our own. Outside, in the first tentative rays of the sun, crouched an old woman, her breasts shrunken and empty, her face greatly lined and in curious contrast to her hair -- thick and cropped like an adolescent. She clung to my knees and addressed me in Dowayo. She had heard that the white men had returned and had wanted to see one again before she died.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was clear that whatever else had happened to the Ninga. they were subject to genetic malformation. The club-foot and dwarfishness of the chief, the hump of the brother, the malformed nipples of all were part and parcel of the same congenital abnormality and not cultural symbolism as I had assumed. Bitter disappointment rapidly gave way, however, to a sense of the ridiculous. Matthieu and the Ninga stared at me as I sat on a rock in the incipient rain and laughed without apparent cause for several minutes.</div>

<div class="line_en">In a wavering, reedy voice, she embarked on the story of her life. It seemed that she had been born a Dowayo. She did not know how many years ago. As a young girl she had been the mistress of a soldier, a white man. She disappeared into her hut and began digging in a battered tin trunk. Her son, who had doubtless heard all this many times before, looked profoundly bored. After a search of some duration, she reappeared with a faded photograph of a rather pudgy young man in the uniform of a sergeant of the French Army. An inscription on the back revealed that this was for 'Black Héloïse' from Henri. She looked infinitely sad to hear the name again after all these years. What happened to Henri? He returned to his village but they had two sons. Alas, they both had died. Then, she was taken by a native trooper, a Ninga. She disappeared again and dug yet deeper into the trunk, returning with a certificate of good conduct in French and a metal disc that seemed to be a receipt for obligatory work on the road. She held it out to me with pride. It was from her Henri -- a present. They had given it to Henri because he had been brave and he had given it to her. I wondered if her son, who could speak French and therefore possibly read, knew of Henri's rather shabby deception of all those years ago. From his pleading expression, I guessed that he did. I admired the cheap aluminium disc and passed it back to her. As we parted, she declared how good white men had always been to her and gave me to understand with her looks that were she a few years younger I might not escape so easily.</div>

<div class="line_en">It is one of the marks of people who have lived in the bush that they are seldom in awe of the skills of others. They are quite prepared to build houses, plan whole villages and execute minor surgical operations with a verve and self-confidence egotistical in the extreme. Given that the skills of any available dentist would be extraordinarily basic, self-treatment looked a much more viable option. As so often when in trouble‚ Matthieu and I headed for the mission.</div>

<div class="line_en">The teeth being made of some sort of plastic, it was deemed sensible to effect a repair with some sort of resin glue. Fortunately, my mission friends, Jon and Jeannie, had a tube in their tool-kit. Unluckily, it took six hours to harden. A hope-inspiring footnote on the label warned that the resin hardened faster if heat was applied. A solution was quickly devised. The teeth were smeared with glue, held in place by two clothes-pegs and heated with a hair dryer. On the whole, the procedure was only slightly more uncomfortable than normal dental practice, though one did tend to get rather thirsty. Two attempts failed owing to the dampness of the surfaces. Again, a solution was devised. We would heat the teeth in the oven to dry them. This was a hazardous operation. Jon and Jeannie only possessed an ancient wood-burning stove whose temperature was virtually uncontrollable. I had a ghastly vision of the teeth melting. The cook stoked away manfully, flashing his own excellent dentition. Luck was with us. With a deft flick of the wrist, Jon whipped out the hot teeth, slapped on glue and clipped on the clothes-pegs. A blast of hot air from the hair dryer completed the treatment. The next few minutes were not pleasant. We had forgotten to allow for the fact that the heat in the teeth would percolate through to the roots. But they stayed in place and lasted till the end of the trip. The only problem was that they rapidly turned green as if in emulation of my monkey friend.</div>
