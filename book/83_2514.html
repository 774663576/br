<div class="line_en">Taggart Wilde, the District Attorney, lived at the corner of Fourth and Lafayette Park, in a white frame house the size of a carbarn, with a red sandstone porte-cochere built on to one side and a couple of acres of soft rolling lawn in front. It was one of those solid old-fashioned houses which it used to be the thing to move bodily to new locations as the city grew westward.

<div class="line_en">Taggart Wilde sat behind a desk, a middle-aged plump man with clear blue eyes that managed to have a friendly expression without really having any expression at all. He had a cup of black coffee in front of him and he held a dappled thin cigar between the neat careful fingers of his left hand. Another man sat at the corner of the desk in a blue leather chair, a cold-eyed hatchet-faced man, as lean as a rake and as hard as the manager of a loan office. His neat well-kept face looked as if it had been shaved within the hour. He wore a well-pressed brown suit and there was a black pearl in his tie. He had the long nervous fingers of a man with a quick brain. He looked ready for a fight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="塔格尔特·王尔德端坐在书桌后面。他是个肥硕的中年男人，一双明亮的蓝眼睛，总能摆出一副友善的表情，其实压根面无表情。他面前放着一杯清咖，左手整洁精致的手指里夹着一根带斑点的细雪茄烟。书桌一角的蓝色皮椅子里还坐着一个男的，他眼神冷峻、脸庞棱角分明，瘦得像一把耙子，冷酷得像借贷处的经理。他的脸修得整整齐齐，好像胡子刮了还不到一个钟头。他穿着一身熨得很平整的棕色套装，领带上有一颗黑色珍珠。他手指细长，略带神经质，一看就头脑敏捷。他看起来随时准备跟你干架。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We went up to the house and rang the bell. A slick-haired blond man opened the door and led us down the hall and through a huge sunken living room crowded with heavy dark furniture and along another hall on the far side of it. He knocked at a door and stepped inside, then held the door wide and we went into a paneled study with an open French door at the end and a view of dark garden and mysterious trees. A smell of wet earth and flowers came in at the window. There were large dim oils on the walls, easy chairs, books, a smell of good cigar smoke which blended with the smell of wet earth and flowers.</div>

<div class="line_en">"That kind of thinking is police business, Marlowe. If Geiger's death had been reported last night, the books could never have been moved from the store to Brody's apartment. The kid wouldn't have been led to Brody and wouldn't have killed him. Say Brody was living on borrowed time. His kind usually are. But a life is a life."</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's physically possible," I said, "but morally impossible. It assumes too much coincidence and too much that's out of character for Brody and his girl, and out of character for what he was trying to do. I talked to Brody for a long time. He was a crook, but not a killer type. He had two guns, but he wasn't wearing either of them. He was trying to find a way to cut in on Geiger's racket, which naturally he knew all about from the girl. He says he was watching Geiger off and on to see if he had any tough backers. I believe him. To suppose he killed Geiger in order to get his books, then scrammed with the nude photo Geiger had just taken of Carmen Sternwood, then planted the gun on Owen Taylor and pushed Taylor into the Ocean off Lido, is to suppose a hell of a lot too much. Taylor had the motive, jealous rage, and the opportunity to kill Geiger. He was out in one of the family cars without permission. He killed Geiger right in front of the girl, which Brody would never have done, even if he had been a killer. I can't see anybody with a purely commercial interest in Geiger doing that. But Taylor would have done it. The nude photo business was just what would have made him do it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“操作起来是可能的，”我说，“但不符合当事人的心理。需要假设太多巧合，很不符合布罗迪和他女友的性格，也违背他行动的目的。我跟布罗迪聊了很久。他是个恶人，却不是杀人行凶的那一类恶人。他有两把枪，可一把也不带在身上。他一心想插手盖革的买卖，具体情况当然都是通过那姑娘了解的。他说他在远处监视着盖革的一举一动，看有没有厉害的人帮衬他。我相信他说的话。先假设他为了夺书杀了盖革，再假设他逃跑时拿了盖革刚拍的卡门·斯特恩伍德的照片，随后把枪栽赃给欧文·泰勒，将他推入里多外面的海里，这他妈也假设得太多了些。泰勒有动机，他妒火中烧，也有杀害盖革的时机。他未经允许开走了主人家的一辆车。他当着那女孩的面杀了盖革，哪怕布罗迪嗜杀成性，也绝对做不出来。我不知道有哪个单纯图盖革钱的人会这么做。可泰勒会。那些裸照恰恰就会刺激他这么干。”">查看中文翻译</div>

The gun might have been planted -- say by Brody, the actual killer."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="王尔德放下两只手，结结实实拍了一下桌子。“够了，”他厉声道，“马洛，你为什么这么确定是那个叫泰勒的小伙子杀了盖革？就算在泰勒的身上或是车里找到了打死盖革的那把枪，也不能说他必然是凶手。枪也许是别人栽赃给他的——比如说布罗迪，没准他才是真凶。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I said: "The kid hasn't told us, but he must have done it. Brody wouldn't have gone into the house after Geiger was shot. The boy must have got home when I was away taking Carmen to her house. He was afraid of the police, of course, being what he is, and he probably thought it a good idea to have the body hidden until he had removed his effects from the house. He dragged it out of the front door, judging by the marks on the rug, and very likely put it in the garage. Then he packed up whatever belongings he had there and took them away. And later on, sometime in the night and before the body stiffened, he had a revulsion of feeling and thought he hadn't treated his dead friend very nicely. So he went back and laid him out on the bed. That's all guessing, of course."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我说：“那孩子没承认，但肯定是他干的。布罗迪不会杀完盖革再回他家去。我送卡门回去的时候，那孩子肯定正好到家。像他那类人，自然害怕警察，他也许觉得，在从屋里搬走个人财物之前先把尸体藏起来为好。根据地毯上的印子判断，他把尸体拖出了大门，很可能放进了车库。接着他把自己的家当都打包搬走了。之后，在晚上的某个时候，他心生悔意，觉得自己不该那样对待自己死去的朋友，所以回去把他放到了床上。当然，这些都是猜测。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Wilde nodded. "Then this morning he goes down to the store as if nothing had happened and keeps his eyes open. And when Brody moved the books out he found out where they were going and assumed that whoever got them had killed Geiger just for that purpose. He may even have known more about Brody and the girl than they suspected. What do you think, Ohls?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="王尔德点点头。“然后今天早上他没事人儿似的去了店里，时刻警惕着。当布罗迪把书运走后，他发现了那些书的去处，心想谁拿了书谁就是为了这个目的杀盖革的凶手。也许他对盖革和他女友的了解要比他俩认为的深入。你怎么看，奥尔斯？”">查看中文翻译</div>
