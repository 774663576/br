<div class="line_en">The ship's AI led AA and Cheng Xin on a tour of the ship to familiarize them with it. Like its predecessor, this new Halo was still a small stellar yacht with a maximum capacity of four. Most of the space on the ship was taken up by the ecological cycling system. By conventional measures, the ecological cycling system was extremely redundant -- a volume of space that would have supported forty was used to provide for only four. The system was divided into four identical subsystems, linked together and acting as each other's backups. If any of the four failed accidentally, the other three could bring it back to life. Halo's other distinguishing characteristic was the ability to land directly on a medium-sized solid planet. This was a rare design choice among stellar ships -- similar ships typically used shuttles to carry landing parties onto planets. Directly descending into a planet's deep gravity well required the ship to have a very strong hull, which greatly increased the cost. Moreover, the need for atmospheric flight required a streamlined profile, which was also very rare among stellar ships. All of these design features meant that if Halo could find another Earthlike planet in outer space, it could act as a habitable base for the crew on the surface of the planet for a considerable amount of time. Maybe it was these characteristics of Halo that led to it being chosen for the artifact-rescuing mission to Pluto.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="起航后，程心和AA在飞船A.I。的引导下开始熟悉“星环”号。与它的前身一样，这一代“星环”号仍然是一艘小型恒星际飞船，最大的乘员数是四人。飞船上的大部分空间被生态循环系统所占据，按照常规计算，生态系统具有很大的冗余量，几乎是用可以维持四十个人的容量来支持四个人的生活。生态系统做成相同的四个，联通运行并互为备份，如果其中一个意外坏死，可由其余的资源再次激活。“星环”号的另一个特点是可以直接在中等质量的固态行星上降落，在恒星际飞船中，这是极其罕见的设计。同类飞船一般都使用随船的太空穿梭机登陆行星，直接进入行星的引力深井要求飞船具有极高的强度，这使得制造成本大大增加。另外因为要出入大气层，“星环”号具有全流线型的外形，这在星际飞船中也十分罕见。基于这样的设计，如果“星环”号在外太空找到一颗类地行星，它可以在相当长的时间里成为行星表面的一个生存基地。也许正是由于这个特点，“星环”号被派往冥王星运出文物。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There were numerous other unusual features on the yacht. For instance, it had six small courtyards, each about twenty to thirty square meters in size. Each courtyard automatically adjusted to the direction of gravity under acceleration, and, during coasting, spun independently within the ship to generate artificial gravity. Each courtyard displayed a different natural scene: a green lawn with a babbling brook running through the grass; a small copse with a spring in the middle; a beach with waves of clear water throwing up surf… These scenes were small but exquisite, like a string of pearls made of the best parts of the Earth. On a small stellar spaceship, such a design was extremely luxurious.</div>

Their initial impression of the dwarf planet was one of darkness, like an eye that remained perpetually shut. This far from the Sun, the light was extremely dim.

The black was rocks -- not necessarily black in color, but the light was too dim to tell otherwise. The blue was solidified nitrogen and methane.

<div class="line_en">Cheng Xin and AA headed for the monolith. Pluto's gravity was only one-tenth of the Earth's, and so they proceeded by leaping. Along the way, they noticed a row of arrows pointing toward the monolith on the ground. Only when they reached the monolith did its immensity impress itself on their minds. When they looked up, it was as though a chunk had been taken out of the starry sky. They looked around and saw that there were rows of arrows coming from other directions, all pointing toward the monolith. At the foot of the monolith was another prominent protuberance: a metal wheel about a meter in diameter. To their surprise, they found the wheel to be hand-operated. Above the wheel was a diagram formed from white lines against the black surface of the monolith. Two curved arrows indicated the directions in which the wheel could be turned. Next to one of the arrows was a drawing of a half-open door, while the other bore a drawing of a shut door. Cheng Xin turned to survey the arrows on the ground pointing to the monolith.

Some gas escaped, and the water vapor within quickly deposited into ice crystals that glinted in the searchlight. They entered the door and saw another door facing them, also operated by a wheel. This time, there were simple written instructions above the wheel, informing them that they were in an air lock and needed to close the first door before opening the second.

<div class="line_en">Cheng Xin walked to one of the walls. In the dim light, she saw that it was covered with dense, carved text, as well as images in relief. The wall was not the original rock, but seemed to have been infused with metal, or perhaps the surface had been coated with some durable titanium alloy or gold. Fundamentally, however, it was no different from carving words into stone. The carved text wasn't small: each character or letter was about a square centimeter. This was another feature intended to help with information longevity, as smaller text tended to be harder to preserve.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="程心走到洞壁前，在黯淡的灯光下，她看到洞壁上密密麻麻地刻满了字，还有浮雕的图形。洞壁应该不是原始岩石，可能经过了金属注入之类的处理，甚至可能表面完全换成钛合金或黄金一类的耐久金属，但从本质上讲，仍是把字刻在石头上。刻的字不是太小，每个约有一厘米见方，这应该也是为长久保存考虑，字越小越难保存。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Cheng Xin looked at the lamp on the cave wall. First, she noticed its shape: an arm poking out of the wall holding a torch. She thought this was a familiar design, but clearly that wasn't what AA meant. The torch-shaped lamp seemed very clumsy. The size and structure resembled an ancient searchlight, but the light it emitted was very weak, about the same as an ancient twenty-watt incandescent light bulb. After passing through the thick lampshade, the light was not much brighter than a candle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="程心看看旁边洞壁上的一盏灯，首先注意到它的造型：一只伸出洞壁的手擎着一支火炬。她觉得这造型很熟悉。但AA显然指的不是这个，这盏火炬形的灯十分笨重，体积和结构都像古代的探照灯一般，但发出的光却很弱，大约只相当于古代的二十瓦白炽灯泡，透过厚厚的灯罩，只比烛光稍亮一点。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Cheng Xin took off a space suit glove and caressed the characters carved into the cold stone. Then she leaned against the cave wall and stared woodenly at the lamps. She realized where she had seen this design: the Panthéon in Paris. A hand holding a torch just like the one on Rousseau's tomb. The faint yellow lights before her now didn't seem to be electric, but like tiny flames about to go out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="程心摘下宇宙服的手套，抚摸着那寒冷石壁上的字迹，然后她背靠着洞壁，看着壁上的灯发呆。她现在想起来在哪里见过这造型：那是法国先贤祠中的卢梭墓，从墓中就伸出一只这样擎着火炬的手，现在这些灯发出昏黄的弱光，这光不像是电发出的，更像奄奄一息的小火苗。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Luo Ji said, "Back that way is the machinery dedicated to providing electricity to this complex, like a power plant. This lamp is an amazing accomplishment. There's no filament or excitable gas inside, and I don't know what the luminous element is, but it can continue to glow for a hundred thousand years. The doors you came through should continue to be operable under normal conditions for five hundred thousand years. After that, the doors will deform and whoever wants to come in will have to break them down. By then, these lamps will have gone out more than four hundred thousand years earlier, and darkness will reign here. But that will be but the start of the journey of a hundred million years."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗辑说：“后面专门为这些灯供电的部分就更大了，像一座发电厂。这灯可是一项了不起的成果，它内部没有灯丝，也没有激发气体，我不知道发亮的是什么，但能够连续亮十万年！还有你们进来时的那两扇大门，在静止状态下，预计在五十万年的时间里能够正常开启，时间再长就不行了，变形了，那时要再有人进来，就得把门破坏掉。在那时。这些灯都已经灭了有四十万年了，这里一片黑暗。但对于一亿年而言，那只是开始……”">查看中文翻译</div>

They began with the relief carving of a man and a woman, perhaps an attempt to show future discoverers what humans looked like.

After the man and the woman came some hieroglyphs and cuneiforms, probably copied from ancient artifacts -- it was possible that some of them were not even intelligible to modern men and women, and if so, how would future extraterrestrial discoverers understand them?

<div class="line_en">"I often stroll around here thinking my own crazy thoughts." Luo Ji paused and pointed at a relief carving of an ancient soldier in armor and wielding a spear. "This is about the conquests of Alexander the Great. If he had kept on going a bit farther east, he would have encountered the Qin at the end of the Warring States Period -- what would have happened then? And how would history have changed?" They walked some more, and he pointed at the cave wall again. By now, the characters carved on the wall had turned from Small Seal Script to Clerical Script. "Ah, we've reached the Han Dynasty. From here to later, China completed two unifications. Are a unified territory and a unified system of thought good things for civilization as a whole? The Han Dynasty ended up endorsing Confucianism above all, but if the multiplicity of schools of thinking during the Spring and Autumn Period had continued, what would have happened later?

Four centuries ago, right after she had started working at the PIA, she had visited New York's Museum of Modern Art on a weekend and saw a few of Van Gogh's paintings. Van Gogh's representation of space had left a deep impression on her. In his subconscious, space seemed to have structure. Cheng Xin wasn't an expert in theoretical physics back then, but she knew that according to string theory, space, like material objects, was made up of many microscopic vibrating strings. Van Gogh had painted these strings: In his paintings, space -- like mountains, wheat fields, houses, and trees -- was filled with minute vibrations. Starry Night had left an indelible mark in her mind, and she was amazed to see it again four centuries later on Pluto.</div>
