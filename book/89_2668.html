<div class="line_en">This is no slow grief. It does not emerge at the tail end of denial, anger, negotiation, depression, or acceptance. It flares up at once, like an all-consuming fire within her, a fire that takes all the oxygen from the air until she's lying on the ground, lashing at the gravel and panting for air. Her body tries to twist into itself, as if there's no spine, as if it is desperately trying to quench the flames inside.</div>

Sven's fingers are curled so hard around the steering wheel it must surely be hurting him. As if he has to keep the pain in some place. He speeds up when he sees the other car. The only car that has any reason to leave Borg at this time of morning. The only brother left for Vega to save.</div>

A man's eyes in the body of a boy. Is this the end of a childhood?</div>

Sven's neck doesn't seem capable of holding up all his thoughts any longer. The woman sits with them all at the kitchen table, speaking slowly and softly, but no one is able to concentrate.

<div class="line_en">Britt-Marie doesn't know how the hours turn into days, or how many of them pass by. By night, she sleeps between the children in Sami's bed. The beating of their hearts in her hands. She stays there for several nights. It is not something she plans, no decision has been made, she just stays there. One dawn after another seems to merge with dusk. Looking back, she has a vague memory of having spoken to Kent on the telephone, but she can't remember what was said. She thinks she may have asked him to arrange some practical things, possibly she asks him to make some telephone calls, he's good at those things. Everyone says Kent is good at those things.</div>

Mechanically shakes their hands. Her eyes are empty, as if someone has turned off a switch inside her. Something is making a thumping noise outside in the parking area but no one listens to it. Britt-Marie tries to get Vega to eat, but Vega doesn't even answer when spoken to. She allows herself to be led to the table and lowered into a chair, but her body reacts as if it's sleeping. It turns so that she faces the wall, as though she wants to avoid any possible physical contact. The thumping gets louder.</div>
