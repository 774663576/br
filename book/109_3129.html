<div class="line_en">Jack crouched with his face a few inches away from this clue, then stared forward into the semi-darkness of the undergrowth. His sandy hair, considerably longer than it had been when they dropped in, was lighter now; and his bare back was a mass of dark freckles and peeling sunburn. A sharpened stick about five feet long trailed from his right hand, and except for a pair of tattered shorts held up by his knife-belt he was naked. He closed his eyes, raised his head and breathed in gently with flared nostrils, assessing the current of warm air for information. The forest and he were very still.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jack was bent double. He was down like a sprinter, his nose only a few inches from the humid earth. The tree trunks and the creepers that festooned them lost themlves in a green dusk thirty feet above him, and all about was the undergrowth. There was only the faintest indication of a trail here; a cracked twig and what might be the impression of one side of a hoof. He lowered his chin and stared at the traces as though he would force them to speak to him. Then dog-like, uncomfortably on all fours yet unheeding his discomfort, he stole forward five yards and stopped. Here was loop of creeper with a tendril pendant from a node. The tendril was polished on the underside; pigs, passing through the loop, brushed it with their bristly hide.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰克弓着身子。他像个短跑选手似的蹲在地上，鼻子离潮湿的地面只有几英寸。在他头上三十英尺光景，树干以及交织着垂挂下来的藤蔓在绿蒙蒙的暮色中混成一片；四周全是矮灌木林丛。踪迹到这儿只有蛛丝马迹可寻：一根断裂的树枝呀，一个可能是蹄子的一侧留下的印记呀。他低着下巴，目不转睛地盯着这些痕迹，似乎想要迫使它们对他说出什么秘密。随后杰克像狗似的四肢着地——这怪不舒服，可他并不觉得，又悄悄地朝前爬了五码停下。在这儿有个成圈圈形状的藤蔓，茎节上垂荡着卷须。卷须的下沿被磨得光光：那是硬毛密生的野猪在穿过藤圈时磨擦所成的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The silence of the forest was more oppressive than the heat, and at this hour of the day there was not even the whine of insects. Only when Jack himself roused a gaudy bird from a primitive nest of sticks was the silence shattered and echoes set ringing by a harsh cry that seemed to come out of the abyss of ages. Jack himself shrank at this cry with a hiss of indrawn breath, and for a minute became less a hunter than a furtive thing, ape-like among the tangle of trees. Then the trail, the frustration, claimed him again and he searched the ground avidly. By the trunk of a vast tree that grew pale flowers on its grey bark he checked, closed his eyes, and once more drew in the warm air; and this time his breath came short, there was even a passing pallor in his face, and then the surge of blood again. He passed like a shadow under the darkness of the tree and crouched, looking down at the trodden ground at his feet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="森林的静谧比起暑热来更为逼人，在这个时刻，甚至连各种昆虫的哀鸣都听不见。只是当杰克从一个枝条搭成的老鸟窠里惊起一只花哨的鸟儿，才打破了宁静，似乎从无限久远的年代里发出一声尖厉的鸟叫，又引起了阵阵的回声。这声怪叫使杰克倒抽一口冷气，缩作一团；片刻之间，与其说他是个猎手，倒不如说是个在乱树丛中鬼头鬼脑的猴样的东西。随后，痕迹和挫折促使他继续前进，他又贪婪地在地面上搜索起来。在一棵灰树干上长着浅色花朵的大树旁，杰克突然停了下来，闭上眼睛，又吸了一口暖和的空气：这一次他呼吸有点儿急促，脸上甚至一阵苍白，随后热血又涌上来。他像幽灵似的穿过树下的黑暗处，蹲着身子，低头察看脚下被踩踏过的土地。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At length he let out his breath in a long sigh and opened his eyes. They were bright blue, eyes that in this frustration seemed bolting and nearly mad. He passed his tongue across dry lips and scanned the uncommunicative forest. Then again he stole forward and cast this way and that over the ground.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他终于长长地叹了口气，睁开了眼睛。蓝莹莹的眼睛这当口儿仿佛因受到挫折而闪着怒火，有点儿发狂。他伸出舌头舔舔干裂的双唇，察看着默默无言的森林。然后又悄悄地向前，边在地上东寻西找。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The droppings were warm. They lay piled among turned earth. They were olive green, smooth, and they steamed a little. Jack lifted his head and stared at the inscrutable masses of creeper that lay across the trail. Then he raised his spear and sneaked forward. Beyond the creeper, the trail joined a pig-run that was wide enough and trodden enough to be a path. The ground was hardened by an accustomed tread and as Jack rose to his full height he heard something moving on it. He swung back his right arm and hurled the spear with all his strength. From the pig-run came the quick, hard patter of hoofs, a castanet sound, seductive, maddening -- the promise of meat. He rushed out of the undergrowth and snatched up his spear. The pattering of pig's trotters died away in the distance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="热乎乎的粪便堆在翻起的土中，光溜溜的，呈橄榄青色，还有点儿在冒气。杰克抬起头来，睁大眼睛看着痕迹上面绕作一团的藤蔓。然后他提起长矛悄悄地前进。穿出这团藤蔓，痕迹与一条野猪出没的路径相交；这条路径被踩踏得足以成为一条小道，宽度也够了。地面因经常被踩踏变得挺硬，杰克站直身子，他听见有东西在小道上走动。他右臂朝后一摆，用尽浑身力气投出长矛。从野猪出没的路径传来一阵急促而猛烈的嗒嗒的蹄子声，一种响板似的声音，引人入胜又令人发狂——吃肉有盼头了。他冲出矮灌木林丛，一把抓起长矛。野猪的快步声却已经消失在远处。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jack stood there, streaming with sweat, streaked with brown earth, stained by all the vicissitudes of a day's hunting. Swearing, he turned off the trail and pushed his way through until the forest opened a little and instead of bald trunks supporting a dark roof there were light grey trunks and crowns of feathery palm. Beyond these was the glitter of the sea and he could hear voices. Ralph was standing by a contraption of palm trunks and leaves, a rude shelter that faced the lagoon and seemed very near to falling down. He did not notice when Jack spoke.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰克站在那儿，汗如雨下，褐色的泥土横一条竖一条地沾在身上，一副打了一天猎的样子。他嘴里嘟囔着骂人话，绕过痕迹处，在树丛中费力地往前走，直走到一处稍微开阔一点的地方；支撑着浓黑树顶的光树干被淡褐色树干和叶冠茂盛的棕榈树所代替。之外是银波闪闪的大海，他又能听见其他孩子们的声音了。拉尔夫正站在一个用棕榈枝叶搭起来的新鲜玩意儿旁边，这是个面朝环礁湖的简陋的窝棚，似乎摇摇欲坠。杰克开口说话时，拉尔夫还没注意到他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When the other two had trotted down the beach to look back at the mountain he had followed them for a few yards and then stopped. He had stood frowing down at a pile of sand on the beach where somebody had been trying to build a little house or hut. Then he turned his back on this and walked into the forest with an air of purpose. He was a small, skinny boy, his chin pointed, and his eyes so bright they had deceived Ralph into thinking him delightfully gay and wicked. The coarse mop of black hair was long and swung down, almost concealing a low, broad forehead. He wore the remains of shorts and his feet were bare like Jack's. Always darkish in color, Simon was burned by the sun to a deep tan that glistened with sweat.</div>

<div class="line_en">He picked his way up the scar, passed the great rock where Ralph had climbed on the first morning, then turned off to his right among the trees. He walked with an accustomed tread through the acres of fruit trees, where the least energetic could find an easy if unsatisfying meal. Flower and fruit grew together on the same tree and everywhere was the scent of ripeness and the booming of a million bees at pasture. Here the littluns who had run after him caught up with him. They talked, cried out unintelligibly, lugged him toward the trees. Then, amid the roar of bees in the afternoon sunlight, Simon found for them the fruit they could not reach, pulled off the choicest from up in the foliage, passed them back down to the endless, outstretched hands. When he had satisfied them he paused and looked round. The littluns watched him inscrutably over double handfuls of ripe fruit.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他择路爬上孤岩，翻过第一天清晨拉尔夫曾爬过的那块大岩石，然后朝右折进树林子。他踏着熟悉的小道穿过成片的野果树，那儿不费力气就可找到吃的，虽然并不尽如人意。同一棵树上又长花儿又长果子，到处都是野果成熟的香味和草地上无数蜜蜂的嗡嗡声。本来在他身后跟着跑的小家伙们，在这儿追上了他。他们七嘴八舌地簇拥着他朝野果树走去，嘴里不知道在叫点什么。接着，在下午的阳光下，在蜜蜂的嗡嗡声中，西蒙为小家伙们找到了他们够不着的野果，他把簇叶高处最好的摘下来，向下丢到许许多多向前伸出的手里。满足了小家伙们以后，他停了停，四下张望一番。小家伙们双手满捧着熟透的野果，莫名其妙地望着他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Simon turned away from them and went where the just perceptible path led him. Soon high jungle closed in. Tall trunks bore unexpected pale flowers all the way up to the dark canopy where life went on clamorously. The air here was dark too, and the creepers dropped their ropes like the rigging of foundered ships. His feet left prints in the soft soil and the creepers shivered throughout their lengths when he bumped them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="西蒙转身离开了他们，沿着勉强辨认得出的小路走去。不久他就进入了高高的丛林之中。高大的树身上满是意想之外的淡雅的花朵，一直长到密不透光的树叶形成了华盖，树林里的小动物在那上面喧闹。这儿的空间也是黑洞洞的，藤蔓垂下了无数的枝条，就像从沉没的船上垂下的索具。柔软的泥土里留下了西蒙的脚印；而当他一碰到藤蔓，它们就从上到下整个儿颤动起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He came at last to a place where more sunshine fell. Since they had not so far to go for light the creepers had woven a great mat that hung at the side of an open space in the jungle; for here a patch of rock came close to the surface and would not allow more than little plants and ferns to grow. The whole space was walled with dark aromatic bushes, and was a bowl of heat and light. A great tree, fallen across one corner, leaned against the trees that still stood and a rapid climber flaunted red and yellow sprays right to the top.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他终于来到了一个阳光更充裕的地方。这儿的藤蔓用不着长得太远就能照到阳光，它们平织成一块大“毯子”，悬挂在丛林中一块空地的一侧；在这儿，有一方岩石压着地面，只有小树苗和凤尾草才能稍稍生长。整个空地的周围都是芳香扑鼻的深色矮灌木丛，就像一个满装着暑热和阳光的碗钵。一棵参天的大树倾倒在这空地的一角，靠在亭亭直立的树木上，一种生长迅速的攀缘植物一直爬到了大树顶上，随风摇曳着它那红色和黄色的小树枝。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Simon paused. He looked over his shoulder as Jack had done at the close ways behind him and glanced swiftly round to confirm that he was utterly alone. For a moment his movements were almost furtive. Then he bent down and wormed his way into the center of the mat. The creepers and the bushes were so close that he left his sweat on them and they pulled together behind him. When he was secure in the middle he was in a little cabin screened off from the open space by a few leaves. He squatted down, parted the leaves and looked out into the clearing. Nothing moved but a pair of gaudy butterflies that danced round each other in the hot air. Holding his breath he cocked a critical ear at the sounds of the island. Evening was advancing toward the island; the sounds of the bright fantastic birds, the bee-sounds, even the crying of the gulls that were returning to their roosts among the square rocks, were fainter. The deep sea breaking miles away on the reef made an undertone less perceptible than the susurration of the blood.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="西蒙停住脚。他像杰克所做过的那样，扭头看看靠近身后的地方，迅速地瞥了瞥四周，肯定周围没有别人。刹那间他几乎是在鬼鬼祟祟地行动。随后他弯下腰扭动着身子往那“毯子”当中钻了进去。藤蔓和矮灌木丛长得如此稠密，西蒙往前挤着，汗水都被刮到枝条上；他身子刚一过去，身后的枝条就又合拢了。他终于安然地到达了正中，到了一个叶子稀疏、又跟林中空地隔开的小角里。他蹲下来，分开树叶，朝外窥测着空地。热烘烘的空中只有一对华丽的花蝴蝶在上下扑飞，别的什么也没有。他竖起警觉的耳朵，屏气静息地倾听着岛上的各种声音。夜幕正在降落；毛色艳丽的怪鸟的啁啾声，蜜蜂的嗡嗡声，正在飞回到筑在方岩石上窝巢的海鸥的哑哑声，都变得越来越轻。几英里之外，深沉的海水撞击着礁石，发出低微的声音，轻得简直令人难以觉察。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Now the sunlight had lifted clear of the open space and withdrawn from the sky. Darkness poured out, submerging the ways between the trees till they were dim and strange as the bottom of the sea. The candle-buds opened their wide white flowers glimmering under the light that pricked down from the first stars. Their scent spilled out into the air and took possession of the island.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此刻阳光已经高得完全照不到空地，并渐渐地从空中褪去。夜色倾泻开来，淹没了林间的通道，使它们变得像海底那样昏暗而陌生。初升的群星投下了清光，星光下，无数蜡烛似的花蕾怒放出一朵朵大白花微微闪烁，幽香弥漫，慢慢地笼罩了整个海岛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Simon dropped the screen of leaves back into place. The slope of the bars of honey-colored sunlight decreased; they slid up the bushes, passed over the green candle-like buds, moved up toward the canopy, and darkness thickened under the trees. With the fading of the light the riotous colors died and the heat and urgency cooled away. The candlebuds stirred. Their green sepals drew back a little and the white tips of the flowers rose delicately to meet the open air.</div>
