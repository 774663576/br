<div class="line_en">I met the inspector just coming from the door which led into the kitchen quarters.</div>

<div class="line_en">"How's the young lady, doctor?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那姑娘怎么样了，医生？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Coming round nicely. Her mother's with her."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“已经苏醒了。她母亲正陪着她。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm afraid not," I said regretfully. "It was a dark night, you. see, and the fellow had his coat collar well pulled up and his hat squashed down over his eyes."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“恐怕没办法，”我只得道歉，“您瞧，今晚外头伸手不见五指，那家伙又把领子高高竖起，帽檐压得挡住了眼睛。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"H'm," said the inspector. "Looked as though he wanted to conceal his face. Sure it was no one you know?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嗯，”警督说，“看来他好像故意把脸遮住。肯定不是你认识的人？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That's good. I've been questioning the servants. They all declare that no one has been to the back door tonight. Your description of that stranger was rather vague. Can't you give us something more definite to go upon?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那就好。我刚才询问了仆人们，他们都声称今晚没人去过后门。你对那陌生人的描述很模糊，能提供更具体些的描绘好让我们去查吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I agreed, but it occurred to me that the roughness had been of an almost exaggerated quality. If, as the inspector thought, the man had wished to hide his face, he might equally well have tried to disguise his voice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我虽然表示同意，却忽然忆起那种粗鲁的语气似乎有些刻意造作。如果像警督说的那样，那人特意要隐蔽真容，那么他也就同样很可能故意伪装声音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I replied in the negative, but not as decidedly as I might have done. I remembered my impression that the stranger's voice was not unfamiliar to me. I explained this rather haltingly to the inspector.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我给了否定的答复，但却没多少把握。印象中那怪人的声音并不陌生，于是我支支吾吾地把这一情况告诉警督。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Do you mind coming into the study with me again, doctor? There are one or two things I want to ask you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“再去书房走一趟好吗，医生？我还有一两个问题要请教。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Davis nodded. "Nothing more likely. You see, I've been instituting a few inquiries as to what Parker has been doing with himself this evening. To tell the truth, I didn't like his manner. The man knows something. When I began to question him, he got the wind up, and plumped out some garbled story of blackmail."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="戴维斯点点头：“可能性非常大。瞧，我刚才一直在调查帕克今晚的行踪。说实在的，我看不惯他那副德行。这家伙肯定知道些什么。当我开始盘问他时，他就乱了阵脚，前言不搭后语地供出有人敲诈之类的话。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I acquiesced. Inspector Davis unlocked the door of the lobby, we passed through, and he locked the door again behind him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我同意了。戴维斯警督打开门廊的锁，我们进门后，他又把门锁上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We don't want to be disturbed," he said grimly. "And we don't want any eavesdropping either. What's all this about blackmail?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不希望有谁碍手碍脚，”他正色道，“更不想让人窃听。敲诈到底是怎么回事？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"If Parker heard anything about blackmail," I said slowly, "he must have been listening outside this door with his ear glued against the keyhole."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“如果帕克听到了关于敲诈的只言片语，”我缓缓答道，“那他肯定是贴着锁孔在门外偷听。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Blackmail!" I exclaimed, very much startled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“敲诈！”我猝不及防，不由得惊呼一声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm rather glad you've brought the matter up," I said. "I've been trying to decide whether to make a clean breast of things or not. I'd already practically decided to tell you everything, but I was going to wait for a favourable opportunity. You might as well have it now." And then and there I narrated the whole events of the evening as I have set them down here. The inspector listened keenly, occasionally interjecting a question.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“多亏你翻出这件事。”我说，“我犹豫了好久，不知该不该坦白。其实我早就准备一吐为快了，但还想等待更适当的时机。不过既然到了这个地步，也没必要再遮遮掩掩。”于是我一五一十将今晚的所有事情从头讲了一遍。警督听得十分认真，不时提几个问题打断我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Is it an effort of Parker's imagination? Or is there something in it?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“究竟只是帕克凭空臆想，还是真有蛛丝马迹？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I took an instant decision.</div>

<div class="line_en">I nodded. "I realize that."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我点点头。“我也意识到了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You say that Mr Ackroyd hinted at a suspicion he had that some member of his household was involved? Household's rather an elastic term."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你说艾克罗伊德先生暗示他怀疑是自己家里人？‘家里人’是个相当暧昧的词。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There's only one thing against it," I said slowly. "If Ackroyd went on reading that letter as soon as I left, as he intended to do. don't see him continuing to sit on here and tum things over in his mind for another hour. He'd have had Parker in at once, accused him then and there, and there would have been a fine old uproar. Remember, Ackroyd was a man of choleric temper."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“只有一处漏洞，”我慢慢地说，“如果我走后艾克罗伊德马上就按计划继续读完那封信，我不相信他会干坐在那儿翻来覆去思考整整一小时。他应该会即刻召见帕克，当场痛骂他一顿，那么呵斥声势必响彻整座房子。还记得吗，艾克罗伊德可是个极易动怒的人。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It looks very like it. He was obviously listening at the door when you came out. Then Miss Ackroyd came across him later bent on entering the study. Say he tried again when she was safely out of the way. He stabbed Ackroyd, locked the door on the inside, opened the window, and got out that way, and went round to a side door which he had previously left open. How's that?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“十有八九。你从书房出来时，他明显就在门口偷听；后来艾克罗伊德小姐又撞见他正要进书房。假设她走远之后，帕克又溜回来，进屋刺死艾克罗伊德，从里面锁上门，打开窗户爬出去，然后绕到他事先打开的边门从那里返回。能说得通吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You don't think that Parker himself might be the man we're after?" I suggested.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“难道您不认为我们要找的人就是帕克？”我建议道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Most extraordinary story I ever heard," he said, when I had finished. "And you say that letter has completely disappeared? It looks bad -- it looks very bad indeed. It gives us what we've been looking for -- a motive for the murder."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“从没听过如此古怪的事。”听完以后警督说，“照你的说法，那封信失踪了？那就麻烦了。我们苦苦搜寻的谋杀动机就藏在里面。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"And the telephone call?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那通电话又怎么说？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Parker sent that all right -- perhaps before he thought of the locked door and open window. Then he changed his mind -- or got in a panic -- and decided to deny all knowledge of it. That was it, depend upon it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“就是帕克自导自演的——也许当时他还没想到门是反锁的，窗子是开着的。后来他又改变了主意——也可能是一时慌乱——便索性说不知道电话的事。就是这样，错不了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Mightn't have had time to go on with the letter just then, suggested the inspector." We know someone was with him a half-past nine. If that visitor turned up as soon as you left, and after he went, Miss Ackroyd came in to say good-night -- well, he wouldn't be able to go on with the letter until close upon ten o'clock."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“也许他当时没来得及把信看完。”警督提出自己的看法，“我们已经知道九点半的时候有人和他在一起。如果你一走，这位神秘人就上门拜访；而此人前脚刚走，艾克罗伊德小姐后脚又进来道晚安——唔，那他一直到将近十点都没有机会继续读那封信。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Ye -- es." I said rather doubtfully.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“也⋯⋯也对。”我将信将疑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Anyway, we can find out the truth about the telephone call from the exchange. If it was put through from here, I don't see how anyone else but Parker could have sent it. Depend upon it, he's our man. But keep it dark -- we don't want to alarm him just yet, till we've got all the evidence. I'll see to it he doesn't give us the slip. To all appearances we'll be concentrating on your mysterious stranger."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“无论如何，我们到电话局一查就能弄清那通电话的真相。如果确实是从这里打出去的，我想不出除了帕克还能是谁。基于这一点，他就是我们要找的人。但暂且别声张——在掌握全部证据之前，还不能打草惊蛇。我会派人紧盯住他。表面上呢，我们就装作全力侦缉你遇见的那个神秘陌生人。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He rose from where he had been sitting astride the chair belonging to the desk, and crossed over to the still form in the arm-chair.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes," he said, nodding at it. "Quite a work of art. There can't be many of them about."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不错，”他点头称赞，“确实是件艺术品。这种东西现在可不多见了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The weapon ought to give us clue," he remarked, looking up. "It's something quite unique -- a curio, I should think, by the look of it."</div>

<div class="line_en">He bent down, surveying the handle attentively, and I heard him give a grunt of satisfaction. Then, very gingerly he pressed his hands down below the hilt and drew the blade out from the wound. Still carrying it so as not to touch the handle, he placed it a wide china mug which adomed the mantelpiece.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他俯下身聚精会神地检查着剑柄，随即满意地哼了一声，小心翼翼地将双手伸到剑柄下方，缓缓从伤口里拔出剑刃。他格外小心，不去触碰剑柄，将短剑放进壁炉台上一只装饰用的敞口瓷杯中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was indeed a beautiful object. A narrow, tapering blade, and a hilt of elaborately intertwined metals of curious and careful workmanship. He touched the blade gingerly with his finger, testing its sharpness, and made an appreciative grimace.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这把剑的确相当漂亮。剑身呈狭长的锥形，剑柄上缠绕着精致的金属纹路，工艺新奇考究。他小心地用手指碰触剑刃，试了试锋利程度，不禁扮了个大大的鬼脸。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"May I examine the body properly now?" I asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“现在我可以仔细验尸吗？”我问道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我望了一眼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He stood off a few steps to judge of his effect.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他后退几步，以进一步鉴定他的发现。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I'll spare you the technical language," I said. "We'll keep that for the inquest. The blow was delivered by a right-handed man standing behind him, and death must have been instantaneous. By the expression on the dead man's face, I should say that the blow was quite unexpected. He may have died without knowing who his assailant was."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“专业术语我就直接跳过了，”我说，“等验尸审讯时再用不迟。这一剑是惯用右手的人从他背后刺进去的，当场毙命。从死者的面部表情来看，应该毫无防备。他死时多半都没来得及看清行刺者是谁。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I dare say they're not apparent to you, but can see them clearly enough." He lowered his voice. "Fingerprints!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我敢说你多半看不出什么，但却瞒不过我的眼睛。”他压低嗓门，“有指纹！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I do not see why I should be supposed to be totally devoid of intelligence. After all, I read detective stories, and the newspapers, and am a man of quite average ability. If there had been toe marks on the dagger handle, now, that would had been quite a different thing. I would then have registered any amount of surprise and awe.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="真不知为什么他会觉得我智商不够。毕竟我也常读侦探小说，也会看报纸，水平不比别人低。如果剑柄上有脚趾印的话那就是另一码事了，那我一定会表现得大为惊讶。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Nice young fellow that," said the inspector. "Something honest and ingenuous about him." I agreed. In the two years that Geoffrey Raymond has been secretary to Ackroyd, I have never seen him ruffled or out of temper. And he has been, I know, a most efficient secretary.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“真是个好小伙子，”警督评价道，“有种诚实正直的气质。”我也有同感。杰弗里·雷蒙德在担任艾克罗伊德的秘书的两年中，我从未见他生气或者失态。而且据我所知，他是一位工作效率极高的秘书。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Why -- I believe -- I'm almost sure that is a curio given to Mr Ackroyd by Major Blunt. It comes from Morocco -- no, Tunis. So the crime was committed with that? What an extraordinary thing. It seems almost impossible, and yet there could hardly be two daggers the same. May I fetch Major Blunt?" Without waiting for an answer, he hurried off.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I can't say I'm sure," she replied. "I didn't stop to look. I knew the family would be down any minute, and I wanted to get away."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Thank you," said the inspector. There was just a trace of hesitation in his manner, as though he would have liked to question her further, but Miss Russell clearly accepted the words as a dismissal, and glided from the room.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, I don't think we need go into the question much further. Somebody -- I'll just say somebody -- could get that dagger any time he liked, and exactly when he got it doesn't matter in the least. I'll be coming up in the morning with the chief constable, Mr Raymond. Until then, I'll keep the key of that door. I want Colonel Melrose to see everything exactly as it is. I happen to know that he's dining out the other side of the county, and, I believe, staying the night…"</div>

<div class="line_en">"A little obvious," murmured my companion. "So Parker is the suspect, is he? Shall we oblige Inspector Davis with a set of our fingerprints also?" He took two cards from the card tray, wiped them with his silk handkerchief, then handed one to me and took the other himself. Then, with a grin, he handed them to the police inspector.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这也有点太欲盖弥彰了，”雷蒙德附耳言道，“可见嫌疑人就是帕克，对不对？我们是不是也该为戴维斯警督留一组指纹啊？”他从放纸牌的托盘中抽出两张牌，用丝绸手帕擦了擦，递给我一张，自己拿了一张。然后他露齿一笑，将它们呈交给警督。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A few minutes later as I came out of the billiard room with Raymond, the latter gave a low chuckle of amusement.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Souvenirs," he said. "No. 1. Dr Sheppard, No. 2, my humble self. One from Major Blunt will be forthcoming in the morning." Youth is very buoyant. Even the brutal murder of his friend and employer could not dim Geoffrey Raymond's spirits for long. Perhaps that is as it should be. I do not know. I have lost the quality of resilience long since myself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“权当纪念品，”他笑道，“一号，谢泼德医生；二号，正是在下。布兰特少校那一份明早送上。”年轻人总是轻浮，就连朋友兼雇主惨遭谋杀，也没让杰弗里·雷蒙德的悲痛之情延续多久。或许这才是人之常情吧，我也不明白。我早就丧失了迅速平复心绪的能力。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I felt the pressure of his hand on my arm, and followed the direction of his eyes. Inspector Davis seemed to be inviting Parker's opinion of a small pocket diary.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他轻轻拧了拧我的胳膊，用目光示意。我循着他看的方向望去，只见戴维斯警督似乎正在拿给帕克一本袖珍日记，询问他的看法。">查看中文翻译</div>
