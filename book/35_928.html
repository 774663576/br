<div class="line_en">Those dark widows. For what purpose did God place them on this mountain path before me? Does he wish to test my humility? Is it not enough he watches me save that gentle couple, the wounded boy also, slay a devil dog, sleep barely an hour on dew-soaked leaves before rising to learn my tasks are yet far from done, that Horace and I must set off again, not down to some sheltering village, but up another steep path beneath a grey sky? Yet he placed those widows there in my way, no doubt about it, and I did well to address them courteously. Even as they sank to foolish insults and throwing clumps of earth at Horace's hindquarters -- as though Horace could be panicked into an unseemly gallop!-- I gave them not so much as a backward glance, speaking instead into Horace's ear, reminding him we must bear all such trials well, for a far greater one awaited us up in those distant peaks where storm clouds now gathered. Besides, those weathered women with their flapping rags were once innocent maidens, some possessing beauty and grace, or at least the freshness that will often serve as well in a man's eye. Was she not that way, the one I sometimes remember when there stretches before me as much land, empty and companionless, as I could ride on a dreary autumn's day? No beauty was she, yet delightful enough for me. I only glimpsed her once, when I was young, and did I even speak to her then? Yet she returns sometimes in my mind's eye, and I believe she has visited me in my sleep, for I often awake with a mysterious contentment even as my dreams fade from me.</div>

<div class="line_en">I felt the lingering joys of just such a feeling as Horace woke me this morning, stamping the soft forest ground where I had lain down after the night's exertions. He knows full well I no longer have the old stamina, that after such a night it is no easy thing for me to sleep but a short hour before setting off once more. Yet seeing the sun already high over the shady roof of the forest, he would not let me sleep on. He stamped his feet until I rose, chainmail complaining. I curse this armour more and more. Has it really saved me from much? A small wound or two at best. It is the sword, not the armour, I have to thank for this abiding health. I rose and observed the leaves around me. Why so many fallen and the summer not yet old? Do these trees ail, even as they shelter us? A shaft of sun breaking through the high foliage fell across Horace's muzzle, and I watched him shake his nose from side to side, as though that beam were a fly sent to torment him. He had no pleasant night either, listening to noises of the forest all about him, wondering to what dangers his knight had gone. Displeased though I was that he aroused me so soon, when I stepped towards him, it was only to hold his neck gently in both my arms, and for a brief moment rest my head in his mane. A hard master he has, I know that. I push him on when I know him to be weary, curse him when he has done no wrong. And all this metal as much burden for him as for me. How much further will we ride together? I patted him gently, saying, "We'll find a friendly village soon, and you'll have a better breakfast than the one you just had."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="今天早上霍拉斯把我喊醒的时候，我就有这种感觉，醒来还感到快乐。我累了一晚上，就睡在树林里松软的地上，霍拉斯踩踏着地面，要把我喊醒。他很清楚，我已经没有以前的精力啦，折腾了一个晚上，睡一个小时就爬起来继续赶路，对我可不是容易的事情。但是，看到太阳已经高挂在阴凉的树林上方，他就不能让我继续睡觉了。他不停地踏脚，最后我只好起来，锁子甲都喀喀作响，好像不愿意。我越来越讨厌这盔甲了。它真的帮我挡过什么吗？最多少受一两次小伤而已。我身体一直健康，要感谢的是这把剑，不是盔甲。我站起身，观察周围的树叶。夏天还没过去，怎么落了这么多呢？这些树为我们遮风挡雨，难道生病了吗？一缕阳光从高高的枝叶间穿透下来，落在霍拉斯的鼻子上，我看着他鼻子晃来晃去，好像那缕光是只苍蝇，飞下来要折磨他。他晚上过得也不好，一直听着周围树林里的声音，心里担心他的骑士不知道上哪儿冒险去了。他那么早叫醒我，我有点不开心，但我还是走过去，双手轻轻抱住他的脖子，把头贴在他的鬃毛上歇了一会儿。他这个主人心狠着呢，这我知道。我知道他累了，可还是逼他继续走；他什么错误也没犯，可我还要骂他。还有这一大堆铁家伙，我穿着累，他驮着也累。我们还要一起走多久呢？我轻轻拍着他，说：“我们很快就能找到一个友好的村子，你就能吃顿早餐，比你刚才吃的好。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I spoke this way believing the problem of Master Wistan settled. But we were hardly down the path, not yet out of the woods, when we came across the bedraggled monk, his shoes broken, hurrying before us to Lord Brennus's camp, and what does he tell us but that Master Wistan has escaped the monastery, leaving his pursuers of the night dead, many no more than charred bones. What a fellow! Strange how my heart fills with joy to hear the news, even though it brings back a heavy task I thought behind us. So Horace and I put aside our thoughts of hay and roast meat and good company, and now we climb uphill once more. Thankfully, at least, we travel further from that cursed monastery. In my heart, it is true, I am relieved Master Wistan did not perish at the hands of those monks and the wretched Brennus. But what a fellow! The blood he sheds each day would make the Severn overflow! He was wounded, the bedraggled monk thought, but who can rely on one such as Master Wistan to lie down and die easily? How foolish I was to let the boy Edwin run off that way, and now who will wager against the two of them finding each other? So foolish, yet I was weary then, and besides, little imagined Master Wistan could escape. What a fellow! Had he been a man of our day, Saxon though he is, he would have won Arthur's admiration. Even the best of us would have feared to meet him as a foe. Yet yesterday, when I saw him meet Brennus's soldier in combat, I might have seen a small weakness on his left side. Or was it his clever ploy of the moment? If I watch him fight once more, I will know better. A skilful warrior all the same, and it would take a knight of Arthur to suspect it, but I thought it so, as I watched the fight. I said to myself, look there, a small lapse on the left side. One a canny opponent might just exploit. Yet which of us would not have respected him?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我这样说，是因为我相信维斯坦阁下的问题已经解决了。但是，我们没走多少路，还没出树林呢，就碰上了那名衣衫破烂的僧侣，鞋子都破了，在我们前面匆匆忙忙赶往布雷纳斯爵爷的营地，他还能告诉我们什么消息呢，无非是维斯坦阁下逃出了修道院，晚上来抓他的人都死了，很多都成了焦黑的骨头。真是个人物啊！奇怪的是，听到这个消息，我心里很高兴，尽管我原以为不必完成的那项艰巨任务，现在又要去完成了。所以，我和霍拉斯也不去想什么干草、烤肉和友好的伙伴啦，现在又在这儿爬山。谢天谢地，至少我们离那该死的修道院越来越远。没错，那些僧侣和令人憎恶的布雷纳斯没杀死维斯坦阁下，我心里感到欣慰。但是，他可真是个人物啊！每天他手上流的血，都要让塞文河泛滥啦！那个穿着破烂的僧侣说，他受伤了，但谁能指望像维斯坦阁下这样的人物会轻易倒下来，说死就死呢？让那个男孩埃德温就那样跑走，我真傻啊，现在，谁敢说他们两人会找不到对方呢？真傻，可我当时很累，而且，也没想到维斯坦阁下竟能逃掉。真是个人物啊！他要是生在我们那个年代，虽然是个撒克逊人，也能赢得亚瑟的赞赏。我们当中最优秀的，也不愿意与他正面为敌。不过，昨天他和布雷纳斯的士兵战斗时，我发现他左侧也许有个小小的弱点。或者是他当时卖了个破绽？如果再看他战斗一次，我就能搞清楚。不过他仍旧是个本领很高的武士，也只有亚瑟王的骑士才能看出问题来。看他战斗的时候，我的确是这么想的，我对自己说，你看那儿，左侧有个小小的弱点。聪明的对手可以利用。但是，我们哪个会不尊重他呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Why choose such a barren spot to gather? Not a cairn, nor a dry well to mark it. No thin tree nor shrub to comfort a wayfarer from sun or rain. Just these chalky rocks from which they rose, sunk into the earth on either side of the road. Let's be sure, I said to Horace, let's be sure my old eyes don't let me down and these are not bandits come to set upon us. But there was no need to draw the sword -- its blade still stinks of that devil dog's slime, no matter I thrust it deep in the ground before I slept -- for they were old women sure enough, though we might have made good use of a shield or two against them. Ladies, let us remember them as ladies, Horace, now we are finally beyond them, for are they not to be pitied? We will not call them hags, even if their manners tempt us to. Let us remember that once, some among them at least possessed grace and beauty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="为什么要在这么个荒凉的地方聚会？没有石头堆，没有干枯的井，什么标记也没有。没有一棵小树，没有一片灌木丛，不能给行路的人遮太阳挡雨。只有她们从上面起身的那些白石头，嵌在路两边的土里。我们要确定一下，我对霍拉斯说，我们要确定一下，我老眼昏花，有没有看错，是不是土匪朝我们扑过来了。但是，没有必要拔剑——剑刃上还有那只恶魔狗的黏液的气味，尽管睡觉前我把剑深深插在地里——因为她们肯定是上了年纪的女人，不过，如果有一两面盾牌抵挡一下，倒是很不错的。女士们——霍拉斯，既然我们终于甩开了她们，就称她们为女士吧，她们不也值得同情吗？我们不要称她们为泼妇吧，虽然她们极不礼貌，让人真想这么称呼。让我们再提醒一下自己，至少她们中的有些曾经容貌美丽、举止优雅。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yet these dark widows, why do they cross our path? Is our day not busy enough? Our patience not yet sufficiently taxed? We'll stop at the next crest, I was saying to Horace as we came up the slope. We'll stop and rest even though black clouds gather and we most likely face a storm. And if there be no trees I'll still sit down right there on the scrubbed heather and we shall rest all the same. Yet when the road finally levelled, what do we see but great birds perched on their rocks, and they rise as one, not to fly into the darkening sky, but towards us. Then I saw they were no birds, but old women in flapping cloaks, assembling on the path before us.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可这些讨厌的寡妇，她们怎么跑到我们的路上了呢？我们这一天难道还不够忙吗？耐心还没有耗尽？我们到下一个山顶停一下吧，上坡的时候我对霍拉斯说。我们要停一下，休息一会儿，虽然天上起了乌云，可能有风暴。如果没树，我也要在那矮石楠上坐下来，我们还是要休息休息。可等路平坦下来，我们看到了什么呢？一群大鸟蹲在石头上，都一起飞起来，不是飞到越来越暗的天空，而是朝我们飞。后来我才看明白，那不是鸟，而是一帮上了年纪的女人，披着大斗篷，聚到我们面前的路上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Here he comes," cried one, "the impostor knight!" Others took up the cry as I came closer, and we might have trotted through their ranks, but I am not one to shy from adversity. So I brought Horace to a halt right in their midst, though gazing towards the next peak as if studying the gathering clouds. Only when their rags flapped around me, and I could feel the blast of their shouts, did I gaze down from the saddle at them. Were there fifteen? Twenty? Hands reached to touch Horace's flanks, and I whispered to calm him. Then I straightened and said, "Ladies, if we are to talk, you must cease this noise!" To which they quietened, but their looks stayed angry, and I said then, "What do you want of me, ladies? Why come upon me this way?" To which one woman calls up, "We know you for the foolish knight too timid to complete the task given him." And another, "If you'd done long ago what God asked of you, would we be wandering the land in woe this way?" And yet another, "He dreads his duty! See it on his face. He dreads his duty!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他来啦，”其中一个喊道，“那个假骑士！”我走近的时候，其他人也跟着喊起来，本来我们可以从她们当中直接走过去，但我可不是一遇到逆境就躲开的那种人。于是我让霍拉斯停下来，就在她们当中，但我的眼睛却凝视着下一座山峰，好像在打量那聚集的云一样。她们的破衣服在我们身边扇动，我能感觉到她们的叫喊声扑面而来，这时候我才从马上低头看着她们。有十五个吗？二十？有人伸手去碰霍拉斯的肚腹，我低声让他不要烦躁。然后我挺直身体，说道，“女士们，如果我们要说话，你们就必须停止叫嚷！”听到这话，她们安静下来，但她们的目光仍然很愤怒。我说：“你们想要怎么样，女士们？为什么要这样拦住我？”一个女人喊道：“我们认识你，你就是那个愚蠢的骑士，胆小如鼠，不敢完成交给你的任务。”另一个说，“如果你很早以前就完成了上帝交给你的任务，我们这时候还会痛苦地到处流浪吗？”又有一个说，“他害怕他的职责！你们看他的脸色。他害怕他的职责！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This shook me, and I cried out, "What do you know of it? What do you know of Querig?" but saw in time the need for restraint. And so I spoke calmly: "Explain it, ladies, what compels you to walk the roads this way?" To which a parched voice behind said, "If you ask why I wander, knight, I'll happily tell you. When the boatman put to me his questions, my beloved already in the boat and reaching out to help me in, I found my most treasured memories robbed from me. I didn't know then but know now, Querig's breath was the thief robbed me, the very creature you were to have slain long ago."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这让我震惊，我喊道：“你们知道什么？魁瑞格，你们知道什么？”但我及时意识到，必须克制。于是我平静地说：“请解释一下，女士们，是什么迫使你们在路上流浪？”人群后面有个干涩的声音说，“你问我们为什么流浪，骑士，我很高兴跟你说说。那个船夫问我问题，我的爱人已经在船里了，正伸手扶我上船呢，可这时候我发现，我最宝贵的记忆都被夺走了。当时我不知道，但现在我知道了，偷走我记忆的贼，就是魁瑞格的呼吸，你很久以前就该杀死她。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Only then do I feel Horace give a tremble, and I hear myself ask, "What are you, ladies? Are you living or dead?" To which the women once more break into laughter, a jeering sound to it that makes Horace shift a hoof uneasily. I pat him gently while I say, "Ladies, why do you laugh? Was that so foolish a question?" And the raspy voice behind says, "See how fearful he is! Now he fears us as readily as he does the dragon!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时候我才感觉到霍拉斯颤抖了一下，我听见自己问，“女士们，你们是什么？是人还是鬼？”她们又一次大笑起来，那嘲讽的声音让霍拉斯不安地挪动着一只蹄子。我轻轻拍着他，说：“女士们，你们为什么笑？这个问题很傻吗？”人群后面那个嘶哑的声音说道：“看他有多害怕！现在他害怕我们，就像害怕龙一样！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"How can you know this, mistress?" I demanded, no longer able to hide my consternation. For how can it be such vagabonds know a secret so well guarded? To which the civil one then smiles strangely and says, "We're widows, knight. There's little can be hidden from us now."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这你怎么知道呢，夫人？”我质问道。我没法隐藏内心的惊恐。这样一个流浪者，怎么可能知道如此严守的秘密呢？那个礼貌的女人奇怪地笑了笑，说道：“我们是寡妇，骑士。现在能瞒住我们的事情不多了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What nonsense is this, lady?" I shout more forcefully, as Horace takes a step back against my wishes, and I have to tug to steady him. "I fear no dragon, and fierce though Querig is, I've faced far greater evils in my time. If I've been slow to slay her, it's only because she hides herself with great cunning in those high rocks. You rebuke me, madam, but what do we hear of Querig now? A time was she thought nothing of raiding a village or more each month, yet boys have grown into men since we last heard of the like. She knows I close in, so she dares not show herself beyond these hills."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“女士，这是什么废话？”我更加用力地喊道，霍拉斯却违背我的意愿，往后退了一步，我使劲拉缰绳才让他稳住。“我不害怕龙。虽然魁瑞格很凶悍，但是我这辈子也面对过更加邪恶的东西。如果说我没有早点杀死她，那是因为她非常狡猾，躲在那些高山的岩石里面。你谴责我，女士，但是现在我们还听得到魁瑞格的风声吗？有段时间，人们只知道她每个月至少都要攻击一个村庄，但是我们已经很久没有听说过类似的事情了吧，小男孩都长成了大人。她知道被我盯住了，所以不敢出来，只躲在那些山里。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Even as I spoke, one woman opened her raggy cloak and a clump of mud struck Horace's neck. Intolerable, I told Horace, we must go on. What can these old crones know of our mission? I nudged him to move forward but he was strangely frozen, and I had to dig in my spur to make him push forward. Thankfully the dark figures parted before us and I was gazing again at the distant peaks. My heart sank at the thought of those desolate high grounds. Even the company of these unholy hags, I thought, might be preferable to those bleak winds. But as though to disabuse me of such sentiments, the women started up their chant behind me, and I felt more mud flung our way. But what do they chant? Do they dare cry "coward"? I had a mind to turn and show my wrath, yet remembered myself in time. Coward, coward. What do they know? Were they there? Were they there that day long ago we rode out to face Querig? Would they have called me coward then, or any of us five? And even after that great mission -- from which only three returned -- did I not then, ladies, with hardly a rest, hurry to the valley's edge to make good my promise to the young maid?</div>

<div class="line_en">Were these the words of a coward, ladies, uttered that very day, even as I rode out to face Querig? And once we were done with our task, and I saw I had been spared -- though two of us five had not -- I hastened back, weary as I was, to that valley's edge and the elder tree where the maid still waited, her hoe in her arms. She sprang to her feet, and the sight of her again tugged my heart. Yet when I tried once more to sway her from her intent, for I dreaded to see her enter that valley, she said angrily, "Are you false, sir? Will you not keep your promise to me?" So I placed her on the saddle -- she held the rein even as she clasped the hoe to her bosom -- and I led on foot both horse and maiden down the valley slopes. Did she blanch as we first heard the din? Or when on the outskirts of the battle we met desperate Saxons, their pursuers on their heels? Did she wilt when exhausted warriors groped across our path trailing wounds along the ground? Small tears appeared and I saw her hoe tremble, but she did not turn away. For her eyes had their task, searching that bloody field left and right, far and near. Then I mounted the horse myself, and carrying her before me as if she were some gentle lamb, we rode together into the thick. Did I look timid then, thrashing with my sword, covering her with my shield, turning the horse this way and that until finally the battle tossed us both into the mud? But she was quickly on her feet, and recovering her hoe, began to tread a path through the mashed and quartered heaps. Our ears filled with the strange cries, but she seemed not to hear, the way a good Christian maid refuses the lewd shouts of the coarse men she passes. I was young then and nimble of foot, so ran about her with my sword, cutting down any who would do her harm, sheltering her with my shield from the arrows that regularly fell among us. Then she saw at last the one she sought, yet it was as if we were adrift on choppy waves and though an isle seems near, the tides somehow keep it beyond reach. It was that way for us that day. I fought and battered and kept her safe, yet it seemed an eternity till we stood before him, and even then three men specially to guard him. I passed my shield to the maid, saying, "Shelter well, for your prize is almost yours," and though I faced three, and I saw they were warriors of skill, I defeated them one by one till I faced the Saxon lord she so hated. His knees were thick with the gore he waded through, but I saw this was no warrior, and I brought him down till he lay breathing on the earth, his legs no more use to him, staring his hatred up at the sky. So she came then and stood above him, the shield tossed aside, and the look in her eyes chilled my blood over all else to be seen across that ghastly field. Then she brought the hoe down not with a swing, but a small prod, then another, the way she is searching for potatoes in the soil, until I am made to cry, "Finish it, maiden, or I'll do it myself!" to which she says, "Leave me now, sir. I thank you for your service, but now it's done." "Only half done, maiden," I cry, "till I see you safe from this valley," but she no longer listens and goes on with her foul work. I would have quarrelled further, but it was then he appeared from the crowd. I mean Master Axl, as I now know him, a younger man that day to be sure, but a wise countenance even then, and when I saw him it was as if the noise of battle receded to a hush around us.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是懦夫的话吗，女士们，就在那天说的，就在我骑马去对付魁瑞格那天？任务完成了，我知道自己侥幸活了下来——我们五个人，有两个没回来——便立即往回赶，虽然我很疲惫，我要回到山谷边缘，回到那棵接骨木下，姑娘还在那儿等着，双手抱着锄头。她跳了起来，再次看到她，又让我心动。我又一次试图说服她不要去，因为我害怕看到她进入山谷，她却愤怒地说：“先生，难道你是骗人的？你不履行对我的承诺？”于是我把她放到马鞍上——她拉着缰绳，怀里还抱着锄头——我在前面步行，领着马和姑娘往山谷里走。她脸色变白了吗，当我们刚听到那喧闹声的时候？还是当我们在战场外围遇到被人紧紧追赶、走投无路的撒克逊人的时候？那些筋疲力尽的武士，从我们前面爬过，伤口的血一路洒在地上，她畏缩了吗？她眼里有泪花，我看见她的锄头在抖动，但她没有扭过头去。她的眼睛忙个不停，在血淋淋的战场上前后左右搜索。然后我自己上了马，把她放在我身前，好像她是只温驯的羊羔一样，我们一起骑马进了战场最深处。那时候我有过怯懦之色吗？我挥舞着剑，用盾牌遮挡她，骑着马东奔西突，直到最后两人都摔在泥浆里？她马上站起身来，找回了锄头，开始在一堆堆残肢断臂之间辟出一条路来。我们耳里全是奇怪的叫喊声，但她似乎没有听到，就像一位信奉基督教的正经好姑娘，只管自己走路，不理会粗俗男人们的下流叫喊。我那时候年轻，脚下灵活，拿着剑在她周围跑来跑去，砍倒所有想伤害她的人，用盾牌遮挡不时飞过来的箭。最后，她终于看到了她要找的人，然而，我们好像漂浮在惊涛骇浪中一样，虽然岛屿就在眼前，却总被浪推开，无法靠近。我们两人那天就是这样。我战斗着、砍杀着，保护着她，但是过了很久我们才来到那人跟前，而且有三个人专门守卫着他。我把盾牌交给那姑娘，说：“挡好自己，他就快是你的了。”我以一对三，也知道他们都是本领很高的武士，但我还是一个一个打败了他们，最后我直接面对她恨之入骨的那位撒克逊领主。他在血流成河的战场上走，腿上全是血，但我能看出来，他不是武士，我把他打倒，他躺在地上喘着气，腿已经没用了，眼睛充满仇恨地瞪着天空。这时候她来了，站到他跟前，盾牌丢在一边，她的眼神让我脊背发凉，超过那可怕战场上的一切。然后她的锄头下来了，不是抡起胳膊甩下来，而是轻轻地锄一下，接着是第二下，好像她是在地里刨庄稼一样。我看不下去，喊道：“了结了吧，姑娘，要不我自己来啦！”她说：“别管我了，先生。我谢谢你帮忙，但现在结束了。”“才结束一半呢，姑娘，”我喊道，“我还要让你安全地离开山谷。”但她不再听我说话，又去做她那可怕的事。我本来会继续争辩下去，可就在这时候，他从人群中出来了。我说的是埃克索阁下，这是他现在的身份，那天他当然更年轻，但那时候他就有一副智慧的样子，我一看到他，好像战场的喧闹立即退去，成了我们周围低低的背景声音一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
