<div class="line_en">Edward didn't seem to disagree. "It's over now," he said, rubbing my arm soothingly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱德华似乎不同意我的看法，“现在已经结束了。”他说道，抚慰地摸摸我的胳膊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Because I was the only one who needed soothing. Edward was fine now -- all the Cullens were fine.</div>

<div class="line_en">They'd all reassured me; Alice reaching up to pat my head as I left, eyeing Jasper meaningfully until a flood of peace swirled around me, Esme kissing my forehead and promising me everything was all right, Emmett laughing boisterously and asking why I was the only one who was allowed to fight with werewolves… Jacob's solution had them all relaxed, almost euphoric after the long weeks of stress. Doubt had been replaced with confidence. The party had ended on a note of true celebration.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们都安慰着我：我走的时候爱丽丝跑过来拍拍我的头，意味深长地看着贾斯帕，直到我被一阵平静的旋涡包围了；埃斯梅吻了我的额头，并且保证不会有事的；埃美特兴高采烈地大笑着问我为什么是唯一一个被允许与狼人们一起作战的人……雅各布的解决方案使他们全都放松下来，经过漫长的几个星期的紧张不安之后几乎变成了一种欣快症。怀疑被自信所取代，派对在一种真正意义上的庆祝曲调中结束。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Not for me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对我而言不是。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Not Jacob, too. Not his foolish, eager brothers -- most of them even younger than I was. They were just oversized, over-muscled children, and they looked forward to this like it was picnic on the beach. I could not have them in danger, too. My nerves felt frayed and exposed. I didn't know how much longer I could restrain the urge to scream out loud.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对雅各布也不好。还有他那些愚蠢而又急不可耐的兄弟——他们大多数人比我年纪还要小，他们只不过是个头过大、肌肉过于发达的孩子，而且他们对这种事情的向往就好像要去沙滩上野餐一样。我不能让他们也身处险境，我的神经感到害怕，就快爆炸了。我不知道我还能撑多久，不让自己大声叫出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Bad enough -- horrible -- that the Cullens would fight for me. It was already too much that I would have to allow that. It already felt like more than I could bear.</div>

<div class="line_en">It took a few more shakes, and his eyes never did open all the way, but I managed to get him off the couch. I helped him up to his bed, where he collapsed on top of the covers, fully dressed, and started snoring again.</div>

<div class="line_en">He could tell I was about to lose it. "Listen to me, Bella. This is going to be easy. The newborns will be completely taken by surprise. They'll have no more idea that werewolves even exist than you did. I've seen how they act in a group, the way Jasper remembers. I truly believe that the wolves' hunting techniques will work flawlessly against them. And with them divided and confused, there won't be enough for the rest of us to do. Someone may have to sit out," he teased.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他明白我就要睡着了：“听我说，贝拉，这样会很容易的。新生的吸血鬼完全不会设防，他们不知道狼人的存在，比你知道的还要少。我看见过他们是怎样集体行动的，按照贾斯帕记得的那种方式，我真的相信狼人们的狩猎技巧用来对付他们是完美无瑕的。他们被分散、被迷惑之后，就不会有足够的事情让我们其他人来做了，有人说不定还得坐在这里呢。”他开玩笑地说道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">People -- well, vampires and werewolves really, but still -- people I loved were going to get hurt. Hurt because of me. Again. I wished my bad luck would focus a little more carefully. I felt like yelling up at the empty sky: It's me you want -- over here! Just me!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="人们——好吧，其实是吸血鬼和狼人，但是仍然——是我所爱的人，他们会受伤。会因为我受伤，又一次，我希望我的霉运能够来得更集中一点。我感觉我就像要对着空洞的天空大叫了：你想要的人是我——就在这儿！只是我！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Victoria had always seemed like a force of nature to me -- like a hurricane moving toward the coast in a straight line -- unavoidable, implacable, but predictable. Maybe it was wrong to limit her that way. She had to be capable of adaptation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="维多利亚对我而言总像一股自然的力量——就像一阵飓风以直线的方式朝海岸移动——不可避免，不能驯服，但是却可以预测。或许用这样的方式解释她的行为是错误的，她一定有能力调整对策。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yes, someone had broken out of their pattern. Was it possible that the Volturi were the flexible ones in this equation?</div>

<div class="line_en">When we got to the big open field, his family was there, talking casually, relaxed. Emmett's booming laugh echoed through the wide space now and then. Edward set me down and we walked hand in hand toward them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当我们来到一块宽广的空地时，他的家人都在那儿，他们随意地交谈着，感觉很放松，埃美特雷鸣般的大笑声时不时地在宽阔的空间里回荡。爱德华把我放下来，我们手牵着手朝他们走去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It took me a minute, because it was so dark with the moon hidden behind the clouds, but I realized that we were in the baseball clearing. It was the same place where, more than a year ago, that first lighthearted evening with the Cullens had been interrupted by James and his coven. It felt strange to be here again -- as if this gathering wouldn't be complete until James and Laurent and Victoria joined us. But James and Laurent were never coming back. That pattern wouldn't be repeated. Maybe all the patterns were broken.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过了足足有一分钟，月亮躲在乌云后面，天顿时暗了下来，周遭一片漆黑，但是我意识到我们到了那块棒球场一样的空地。这是相同的地方，一年以前，在这里我第一次和卡伦家的人一起度过了一个轻松愉快的夜晚，却被詹姆斯和他的党羽们打断了。故地重游让我感到有些奇怪——好像这次聚会在詹姆斯、劳伦特、维多利亚参与进来之前是不完整的，但是詹姆斯和劳伦特永远都不会回来了，这种常规再也不会重复，或许所有的常规都被打破了。">查看中文翻译</div>

Your theory suits her personality perfectly. She's shown a remarkable gift for self-preservation from the start -- maybe it's a talent of hers. In any case, this plot would put her in no danger at all from us, if she sits safely behind and lets the newborns wreak their havoc here. And maybe little danger from the Volturi, either. Perhaps she's counting on us to win, in the end, though certainly not without heavy casualties of our own. But no survivors from her little army to bear witness against her. In fact," he continued, thinking it through, "if there were survivors, I'd bet she'd be planning to destroy them herself… Hmm. Still, she'd have to have at least one friend who was a bit more mature. No fresh-made newborn left your father alive…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嗯，”他终于说道，“这是可能的。我仍然认为沃尔图里家族最可能……但是你的理论——也很有道理。维多利亚的个性，你的理论完全符合她的个性。她从一开始就表现出自保的天赋——或许这是她的才华。不管如何，这个阴谋不会使她面临来自我们这边的任何危险，如果她安全地躲在后面，袖手旁观，让新生儿在这里引起祸害。也许，来自沃尔图里家族的危险也微乎其微。很可能她确信我们最终会赢，尽管并不是没有对我们造成很大的伤亡。但是她的小军队中不会有幸存者来指证她。实际上，”他得出结论继续说道。“如果有幸存者的话，我打赌她会计划自己亲自摧毁他们……嗯，不过，她至少有一个稍微成熟一些的新朋友。没有哪个毫无经验的新生儿会让你的父亲活着……”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="尽管他这么说，他的眼睛却小心翼翼地扫视着黑黢黢的树林，他在树影里搜索的时候脸上露出非常古怪的表情。他的嘴唇向后拉露出牙齿，眼睛则冒着奇怪的光芒——一种充满狂野而又凶猛的希望光芒。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Edward shook his head. "Her scent is too strong and, combined with mine, especially distinct. Even if I carried her, it would leave a trail. Our trace is all over the range, but in conjunction with Bella's scent, it would catch their attention. We're not sure exactly which path they'll take, because they don't know yet. If they crossed her scent before they found us…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱德华摇摇头：“她的气味太强烈了，和我的在一起，特别明显。即使我背着她，还是会留下蛛丝马迹。我们的踪迹遍布在山脉上，但是和贝拉的混合在一起的话，他们就会注意到。我们不确定他们要走的到底是哪条路线，因为他们自己也还不知道。如果他们在找到我们之前就遇到她的气味……”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jacob turned away from them and paced swiftly into the woods. I didn't say anything as the dark closed around us. I was pouting, uncomfortable in Jacob's arms. It felt too intimate to me -- surely he didn't need to hold me quite so tightly -- and I couldn't help but wonder what it felt like to him. It reminded me of my last afternoon in La Push, and I didn't want to think about that. I folded my arms, annoyed when the brace on my hand intensified the memory.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雅各布从他们身边走开，迅速地朝森林跑去。我一言不发，看着黑暗把我们包围起来。我绷着脸，在雅各布的怀抱里感到非常不舒服。这对我而言太亲密了些——当然他没有必要把我抱得这么紧——而且我不得不好奇他有什么样的感觉。这使塑謇到上一次我在拉普西的那个下午，我不愿想起那件事情。我抱着胳膊，手上的链子增强了我的记忆，使我感到烦躁不安。">查看中文翻译</div>
