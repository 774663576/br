<div class="line_en">There were fine sunsets even in the square, sometimes. One could only see parts of them, however, between the chimneys and over the roofs. From the kitchen windows one could not see them at all, and could only guess that they were going on because the bricks looked warm and the air rosy or yellow for a while, or perhaps one saw a blazing glow strike a particular pane of glass somewhere. There was, however, one place from which one could see all the splendor of them: the piles of red or gold clouds in the west; or the purple ones edged with dazzling brightness; or the little fleecy, floating ones, tinged with rose-color and looking like flights of pink doves scurrying across the blue in a great hurry if there was a wind. The place where one could see all this, and seem at the same time to breathe a purer air, was, of course, the attic window. When the square suddenly seemed to begin to glow in an enchanted way and look wonderful in spite of its sooty trees and railings, Sara knew something was going on in the sky; and when it was at all possible to leave the kitchen without being missed or called back, she invariably stole away and crept up the flights of stairs, and, climbing on the old table, got her head and body as far out of the window as possible. When she had accomplished this, she always drew a long breath and looked all round her. It used to seem as if she had all the sky and the world to herself. No one else ever looked out of the other attics. Generally the skylights were closed; but even if they were propped open to admit air, no one seemed to come near them. And there Sara would stand, sometimes turning her face upward to the blue which seemed so friendly and near -- just like a lovely vaulted ceiling -- sometimes watching the west and all the wonderful things that happened there: the clouds melting or drifting or waiting softly to be changed pink or crimson or snow-white or purple or pale dove-gray. Sometimes they made islands or great mountains enclosing lakes of deep turquoise-blue, or liquid amber, or chrysoprase-green; sometimes dark headlands jutted into strange, lost seas; sometimes slender strips of wonderful lands joined other wonderful lands together. There were places where it seemed that one could run or climb or stand and wait to see what next was coming -- until, perhaps, as it all melted, one could float away. At least it seemed so to Sara, and nothing had ever been quite so beautiful to her as the things she saw as she stood on the table -- her body half out of the skylight -- the sparrows twittering with sunset softness on the slates. The sparrows always seemed to her to twitter with a sort of subdued softness just when these marvels were going on.</div>

<div class="line_en">She mounted her table and stood looking out. It was a wonderful moment. There were floods of molten gold covering the west, as if a glorious tide was sweeping over the world. A deep, rich yellow light filled the air; the birds flying across the tops of the houses showed quite black against it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她登上桌子站着向外看。真是个美妙的时刻。一片洪水般的黄金熔液遮住了西天，好像有一阵光辉灿烂的潮水在扫荡着这世界。空间充满了鲜艳的深黄色光辉，鸟儿飞过屋顶，在光亮的背景上，显得黑黑的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She suddenly turned her head because she heard a sound a few yards away from her. It was an odd sound like a queer little squeaky chattering. It came from the window of the next attic. Someone had come to look at the sunset as she had. There was a head and a part of a body emerging from the skylight, but it was not the head or body of a little girl or a housemaid; it was the picturesque white-swathed form and dark-faced, gleaming-eyed, white-turbaned head of a native Indian man-servant -- "a Lascar," Sara said to herself quickly -- and the sound she had heard came from a small monkey he held in his arms as if he were fond of it, and which was snuggling and chattering against his breast.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她突然转过头来，因为听到在几码外有一种声音。那是个奇特的声音，像是种古隆、刺耳的吱吱叫声。它从隔壁阁楼的窗口传来。有人也像她那样在看日落。有个脑袋和一部分身体从天窗里露出来，可那并不是小女孩或女仆的，而是个很别致的、一身白的身影，一个脸色黝黑、双眸闪光、扎着白头巾的印度籍男仆——“一位印度水手，”萨拉立即自语道，而她听到的声音是他抱着的一只小猴子所发出的，看来他很宠爱它，它偎依在他胸前吱吱叫着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was such a sunset as this a few days after the Indian gentleman was brought to his new home; and, as it fortunately happened that the afternoon's work was done in the kitchen and nobody had ordered her to go anywhere or perform any task, Sara found it easier than usual to slip away and go upstairs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那位印度绅士搬进新居几天以后，就出现了像这样的日落奇景，而幸运的是，碰巧那天厨房里下午的活儿已经做完，并且没人支使她到哪儿去，或者去干什么苦差使，因此萨拉发现比平常容易溜到楼上去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As Sara looked toward him he looked toward her. The first thing she thought was that his dark face looked sorrowful and homesick. She felt absolutely sure he had come up to look at the sun, because he had seen it so seldom in England that he longed for a sight of it. She looked at him interestedly for a second, and then smiled across the slates. She had learned to know how comforting a smile, even from a stranger, may be.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当萨拉向他望去的时候，他也向她望着。她首先想到的是他那张黑脸带着忧伤，像是害了思乡病。她绝对相信他是上来看太阳的，因为他在英国很少看到太阳，所以巴不得看一眼。她饶有兴趣地看了他片刻，隔着石板瓦冲着对方微笑。她知道微笑是多么令人欣慰，即使出自陌生人也罢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hers was evidently a pleasure to him. His whole expression altered, and he showed such gleaming white teeth as he smiled back that it was as if a light had been illuminated in his dusky face. The friendly look in Sara's eyes was always very effective when people felt tired or dull.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的笑容显然使他愉快。他的整个表情都变了，他也报之以微笑，露出一口光亮的白牙齿，好像有道光照亮了他那黑黝黝的脸庞。萨拉眼中的友好目光对于感到疲劳或消沉的人总能十分奏效。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was perhaps in making his salute to her that he loosened his hold on the monkey. He was an impish monkey and always ready for adventure, and it is probable that the sight of a little girl excited him. He suddenly broke loose, jumped on to the slates, ran across them chattering, and actually leaped on to Sara's shoulder, and from there down into her attic room. It made her laugh and delighted her; but she knew he must be restored to his master -- if the Lascar was his master -- and she wondered how this was to be done. Would he let her catch him, or would he be naughty and refuse to be caught, and perhaps get away and run off over the roofs and be lost? That would not do at all. Perhaps he belonged to the Indian gentleman, and the poor man was fond of him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="也许是为了向她敬礼，他才放松了那只猴子。这是只顽皮的小猴子，随时准备干冒险的事儿，大概是看到了个小姑娘，才使它兴奋起来。它突然挣出身来，跳上石板瓦，一边吱吱叫着，一边跑过来。竟跃到萨拉肩上，又跳下来进入她的阁楼。这使她高兴得笑起来，但她知道必须把它还给他的主人——如果那位印度水手是它的主人的话——她心想不知道该怎么办。它会让她捉住吗？会不会淘气得不让她捉住，也许还会从屋]页上逃跑，再也找不到。这可绝对不行。或许它属于那位印度绅士，而那个可怜人是喜爱它的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She thought she had never seen more surprise and delight than the dark face expressed when she spoke in the familiar tongue. The truth was that the poor fellow felt as if his gods had intervened, and the kind little voice came from heaven itself. At once Sara saw that he had been accustomed to European children. He poured forth a flood of respectful thanks. He was the servant of Missee Sahib. The monkey was a good monkey and would not bite; but, unfortunately, he was difficult to catch. He would flee from one spot to another, like the lightning. He was disobedient, though not evil. Ram Dass knew him as if he were his child, and Ram Dass he would sometimes obey, but not always. If Missee Sahib would permit Ram Dass, he himself could cross the roof to her room, enter the windows, and regain the unworthy little animal. But he was evidently afraid Sara might think he was taking a great liberty and perhaps would not let him come.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她想，当她用他熟悉的语言说话时，那张黑脸上流露出的惊讶和喜悦之强烈是她从未见过的。实际上，这可怜的家伙感到主宰他的那些神灵前来介入，这亲切微弱的语音是从天上传来的。萨拉立即明白了他习惯相处的是欧洲儿童。他滔滔不绝地恭敬道谢。他是你这位小姐的仆人。那猴子是不咬人的好猴子，但不幸的是，要逮住它可不容易。它会像闪电般东逃西窜。它虽然并不可恶，却不肯听话。拉姆。达斯了解它，如同自己的孩子，而它有时会服从拉姆·达斯，但乒不每一次卻]艮从。只要你这位小姐允许，拉姆·达斯愿意越过房顶，钻进她屋子的窗户，把这不足道的小东物抓回去。但他显然担心萨拉可能会认为他太鲁莽也许不让他过去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ram Dass slipped through his attic window and crossed to hers as steadily and lightly as if he had walked on roofs all his life. He slipped through the skylight and dropped upon his feet without a sound. Then he turned to Sara and salaamed again. The monkey saw him and uttered a little scream. Ram Dass hastily took the precaution of shutting the skylight, and then went in chase of him. It was not a very long chase. The monkey prolonged it a few minutes evidently for the mere fun of it, but presently he sprang chattering on to Ram Dass's shoulder and sat there chattering and clinging to his neck with a weird little skinny arm.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拉姆·达斯溜出他的阁楼窗子，轻巧而稳当地越过房顶，好像他生来就在房顶上行走似的。他溜进天窗，悄无声息地落了地，然后转向萨拉，又行了个额乒礼。那猴子看见了他，发出一声轻轻的尖叫。拉姆·达断为了小心起见，连忙关上天窗，然后去追逐猴子。介只追了不多一会儿。那猴子只拖了几分钟，显然只不过是寻寻开心，不久就吱吱叫着跳上了拉姆·达斯的月膀，坐在那儿，用一条古怪的瘦小胳膊搂住拉姆·达斯的脖子，继续吱吱叫。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ram Dass thanked Sara profoundly. She had seen that his quick native eyes had taken in at a glance all the bare shabbiness of the room, but he spoke to her as if he were speaking to the little daughter of a rajah, and pretended that he observed nothing. He did not presume to remain more than a few moments after he had caught the monkey, and those moments were given to further deep and grateful obeisance to her in return for her indulgence. This little evil one, he said, stroking the monkey, was, in truth, not so evil as he seemed, and his master, who was ill, was sometimes amused by him. He would have been made sad if his favorite had run away and been lost. Then he salaamed once more and got through the skylight and across the slates again with as much agility as the monkey himself had displayed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拉姆·达斯深深感谢萨拉。她看得出他那敏锐的土著人的眼睛对室内的破烂不堪已一目了然，但也对她讲话的样子像是对印度土邦主的小女儿一样，装作什么也没看见。他逮住了那猴子，打算只呆几分钟就走，利用这点时间进一步向她深深致礼，以感谢她的宽容，他抚摸着那猴子说，这个小坏蛋实际上并不像它看上去那样坏，他那生病的主人有时候拿它逗乐。要是这宝贝儿跑掉了，主人会伤心的的。随后他再次行额手礼，钻出天窗，又顺着石板瓦屋顶爬过去，敏捷得就像那只猴子一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When he had gone Sara stood in the middle of her attic and thought of many things his face and his manner had brought back to her. The sight of his native costume and the profound reverence of his manner stirred all her past memories. It seemed a strange thing to remember that she -- the drudge whom the cook had said insulting things to an hour ago -- had only a few years ago been surrounded by people who all treated her as Ram Dass had treated her; who salaamed when she went by, whose foreheads almost touched the ground when she spoke to them, who were her servants and her slaves. It was like a sort of dream. It was all over, and it could never come back. It certainly seemed that there was no way in which any change could take place. She knew what Miss Minchin intended that her future should be. So long as she was too young to be used as a regular teacher, she would be used as an errand girl and servant and yet expected to remember what she had learned and in some mysterious way to learn more. The greater number of her evenings she was supposed to spend at study, and at various indefinite intervals she was examined and knew she would have been severely admonished if she had not advanced as was expected of her. The truth, indeed, was that Miss Minchin knew that she was too anxious to learn to require teachers. Give her books, and she would devour them and end by knowing them by heart. She might be trusted to be equal to teaching a good deal in the course of a few years. This was what would happen: when she was older she would be expected to drudge in the schoolroom as she drudged now in various parts of the house; they would be obliged to give her more respectable clothes, but they would be sure to be plain and ugly and to make her look somehow like a servant. That was all there seemed to be to look forward to, and Sara stood quite still for several minutes and thought it over.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他走后，萨拉站在阁楼中央，浮想联翩，都是拉姆·达斯的脸庞和举止所勾起的。看到了他的土著服装和毕恭毕敬的态度，激起了她对往昔的所有回忆。想想也觉得奇怪，她这个在一小时前厨子曾恶语相加的苦工，仅仅在几年前还被人包围着，像拉姆·达斯刚才对她那样对待她，当她走过时，他们向她行额手礼，对他们讲活时，他们的前额几乎触及地面，他们是她的仆人和奴隶。真像是一场梦。一切都一去不复返了。看来肯定没有什么转机了。她知道铭钦女士存心要给地安排什么样的未来。只要她还太小，不能当正规教师使用，就可以拿她当跑腿丫头和仆人使唤，然而还要指望她牢记所学过的功课，并且以某种秘密方式学到更多的知识。大多数夜晚她都得用在学习上，还要不定期地接受检查，如果没有获得预期的进步，就会受到严厉的警告。实际上铭钦女士明知道她那种如饥似渴的学习是无需老师教的。给了她书本，她就会拚命读，直到牢记在心中。只消几年工夫，她无疑便能胜任教很多课程。未来的前景是：等她长大了一些，就可以指望她完成教室里的艰苦任务，一如她现在在干家中的各项苦差事一样。他们将不得不给她穿较体面的衣服，但必须是朴索、难看的，使她看起来多少像个仆人。这似乎就是她能盼望的一切，于是萨拉一动不动地站住了几分钟，反复思索着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Whatever comes," she said, "cannot alter one thing. If I am a princess in rags and tatters, I can be a princess inside. It would be easy to be a princess if I were dressed in cloth of gold, but it is a great deal more of a triumph to be one all the time when no one knows it. There was Marie Antoinette when she was in prison and her throne was gone and she had only a black gown on, and her hair was white, and they insulted her and called her Widow Capet. She was a great deal more like a queen then than when she was so gay and everything was so grand. I like her best then. Those howling mobs of people did not frighten her. She was stronger than they were, even when they cut her head off."</div>

<div class="line_en">This was not a new thought, but quite an old one, by this time. It had consoled her through many a bitter day, and she had gone about the house with an expression in her face which Miss Minchin could not understand and which was a source of great annoyance to her, as it seemed as if the child were mentally living a life which held her above he rest of the world. It was as if she scarcely heard the rude and acid things said to her; or, if she heard them, did not care for them at all. Sometimes, when she was in the midst of some harsh, domineering speech, Miss Minchin would find the still, unchildish eyes fixed upon her with something like a proud smile in them.

<div class="line_en">The morning after the interview with Ram Dass and his monkey, Sara was in the schoolroom with her small pupils. Having finished giving them their lessons, she was putting the French exercise-books together and thinking, as she did it, of the various things royal personages in disguise were called upon to do: Alfred the Great, for instance, burning the cakes and getting his ears boxed by the wife of the neat-herd. How frightened she must have been when she found out what she had done. If Miss Minchin should find out that she -- Sara, whose toes were almost sticking out of her boots -- was a princess -- a real one! The look in her eyes was exactly the look which Miss Minchin most disliked. She would not have it; she was quite near her and was so enraged that she actually flew at her and boxed her ears -- exactly as the neat-herd's wife had boxed King Alfred's. It made Sara start. She wakened from her dream at the shock, and, catching her breath, stood still a second. Then, not knowing she was going to do it, she broke into a little laugh.</div>
