<div class="line_en">They started again before the day was broad. Not that most of the Company were eager to hurry southwards: they were content that the decision, which they must make at latest when they came to Rauros and the Tindrock Isle, still lay some days ahead; and they let the River bear them on at its own pace, having no desire to hasten towards the perils that lay beyond, whichever course they took in the end. Aragorn let them drift with the stream as they wished, husbanding their strength against weariness to come. But he insisted that at least they should start early each day and journey on far into the evening; for he felt in his heart that time was pressing, and he feared that the Dark Lord had not been idle while they lingered in Lorien.</div>

<div class="line_en">Frodo was roused by Sam. He found that he was lying, well wrapped, under tall grey-skinned trees in a quiet corner of the woodlands on the west bank of the Great River, Anduin. He had slept the night away, and the grey of morning was dim among the bare branches. Gimli was busy with a small fire near at hand.</div>

<div class="line_en">Upon the west to their right the land was treeless also, but it was flat, and in many places green with wide plains of grass. On this side of the River they passed forests of great reeds, so tall that they shut out all view to the west, as the little boats went rustling by along their fluttering borders. Their dark withered plumes bent and tossed in the light cold airs, hissing softly and sadly. Here and there through openings Frodo could catch sudden glimpses of rolling meads, and far beyond them hills in the sunset, and away on the edge of sight a dark line, where marched the southernmost ranks of the Misty Mountains.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们看见西方，右边的土地也同样是光秃秃的，但唯一的差别是至少这里很平坦，间或交杂着大片绿油油的草地。河的这边有许多的杂草和森林，几乎遮蔽了整个西方的视线，因此小舟靠近的时候什么也看不见。偶尔在这一堆杂草中还有着开口，佛罗多突然间会看见许多绵延不绝的牧草地，在极远方的地平线有一道黑色的轮廓，那里就是迷雾山脉最南缘的区域。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Nonetheless they saw no sign of an enemy that day, nor the next. The dull grey hours passed without event. As the third day of their voyage wore on the lands changed slowly: the trees thinned and then failed altogether. On the eastern bank to their left they saw long formless slopes stretching up and away toward the sky; brown and withered they looked, as if fire had passed over them, leaving no living blade of green: an unfriendly waste without even a broken tree or a bold stone to relieve the emptiness. They had come to the Brown Lands that lay, vast and desolate, between Southern Mirkwood and the hills of the Emyn Muil. What pestilence or war or evil deed of the Enemy had so blasted all that region even Aragorn could not tell.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不用说，当天他们自然什么敌人的踪影也没看见，第二天也是一样，他们就这样一天天的过着，旅程中没有任何起伏。他们可以看见东边的岸上，是许多外貌模糊的斜坡绵延伸展；它们看起来黄褐、枯萎，彷佛刚被野火烧过，没有留下任何的翠绿之色。在这块邪异的荒地中，甚至没有任何一株站立的树木或是岩石。他们已经来到了介于南幽暗密林和艾明莫尔之间的广大荒地，被称作褐地的区域，连阿拉贡也不知道是什么样的疫病、战争或是魔王的伎俩，才把此地变得如此恐怖。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"But we have not journeyed far south yet," answered Aragorn. "It is still winter, and we are far from the sea. Here the world is cold until the sudden spring, and we may yet have snow again. Far away down in the Bay of Belfalas, to which Anduin runs, it is warm and merry, maybe, or would be but for the Enemy. But here we are not above sixty leagues, I guess, south of the Southfarthing away in your Shire, hundreds of long miles yonder. You are looking now south-west across the north plains of the Riddermark, Rohan the land of the Horse-lords. Ere long we shall come to the mouth of the Limlight that runs down from Fangorn to join the Great River. That is the north boundary of Rohan; and of old all that lay between Limlight and the White Mountains belonged to the Rohirrim. It is a rich and pleasant land, and its grass has no rival; but in these evil days folk do not dwell by the River or ride often to its shores. Anduin is wide, yet the orcs can shoot their arrows far across the stream; and of late, it is said, they have dared to cross the water and raid the herds and studs of Rohan."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这是因为我们走得还不够南，”阿拉贡回答：“现在还是冬天，我们又离海很远。在早春之前，这里都会很冷，甚至可能会再看见雪花。到了远方的贝尔法拉斯湾，如果没有魔王的影响，或许会又暖又快乐，但是，根据我的推测，这里距离你们夏尔的南区可能不到一百八十哩。你眼前的是骠骑国北端的大平原，也就是洛汗国，牧马王的家园。不久之后，我们应该就可以来到林莱河汇流口，看到法贡森林，那就是洛汗国北边的边境，在古代，林莱河和白色山脉之间的所有土地都是属于洛汗国的。这是块丰美、富饶的大地，草原也是最富庶的；不过，在这乱世时，人们不敢居住在大河边，也不敢骑马靠近这附近。安都因的确很宽，但半兽人的箭矢也可以轻易飞过她的河面。近来，甚至有半兽人大胆地越过安都因，直接劫掠洛汗国放牧的马匹和牲畜。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sam looked from bank to bank uneasily. The trees had seemed hostile before, as if they harboured secret eyes and lurking dangers; now he wished that the trees were still there. He felt that the Company was too naked, afloat in little open boats in the midst of shelterless lands, and on a river that was the frontier of war.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆不安地看着两边的河岸。原先的树木在他眼中看来虎视眈眈，彷佛隐藏着无数个敌人。现在，他反而希望树木还在那边，至少可以遮掩敌人的视线；不要让大家曝露在大河的正中央，甚至是处在两军交战的边界上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the next day or two, as they went on, borne steadily southwards, this feeling of insecurity grew on all the Company. For a whole day they took to their paddles and hastened forward. The banks slid by. Soon the River broadened and grew more shallow; long stony beaches lay upon the east, and there were gravel-shoals in the water, so that careful steering was needed. The Brown Lands rose into bleak wolds, over which flowed a chill air from the East. On the other side the meads had become rolling downs of withered grass amidst a land of fen and tussock. Frodo shivered, thinking of the lawns and fountains, the clear sun and gentle rains of Lothlorien. There was little speech and no laughter in any of the boats. Each member of the Company was busy with his own thoughts.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在接下来的一两天之内，他们继续朝南走，所有的队员现在都开始有了那种不安的感觉，他们一整天都会下意识地拿起桨拼命往前划。很快地，河面就变得更宽、更浅，东岸是多岩的滩头，水面底下还有隐藏的漩涡，因此驾船者必须格外小心。褐地则变成高地起伏的荒原，其中飘汤着东方吹来的阵阵冷风。在草原另一边的景物也有所变化，慢慢地转化成丛草聚集的沼泽。佛罗多一想到几日前还居住在罗斯洛立安的草地和喷泉之间，不禁怀念起那里的太陽和温柔的阵雨来。每一艘船上都极少有人交谈或是谈笑，每个成员的时间都花在沉思上面。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As dusk drew down on the fourth day, he was looking back over the bowed heads of Frodo and Aragorn and the following boats; he was drowsy and longed for camp and the feel of earth under his toes. Suddenly something caught his sight: at first he stared at it listlessly, then he sat up and rubbed his eyes; but when he looked again he could not see it any more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到了第四天的傍晚，他坐在船首，回头看着佛罗多、阿拉贡和其他的小舟，一心只想要赶快上岸，活动活动筋骨。突然间，他看见了某种东西，一开始他目瞪口呆地看着这景象，接着，他揉揉眼睛，定睛一看，那景象却已经消失了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The heart of Legolas was running under the stars of a summer night in some northern glade amid the beech-woods; Gimli was fingering gold in his mind, and wondering if it were fit to be wrought into the housing of the Lady's gift. Merry and Pippin in the middle boat were ill at ease, for Boromir sat muttering to himself, sometimes biting his nails, as if some restlessness or doubt consumed him, sometimes seizing a paddle and driving the boat close behind Aragorn's. Then Pippin, who sat in the bow looking back, caught a queer gleam in his eye, as he peered forward gazing at Frodo. Sam had long ago made up his mind that, though boats were maybe not as dangerous as he had been brought up to believe, they were far more uncomfortable than even he had imagined. He was cramped and miserable, having nothing to do but stare at the winter-lands crawling by and the grey water on either side of him. Even when the paddles were in use they did not trust Sam with one.</div>

<div class="line_en">That night they camped on a small eyot close to the western bank. Sam lay rolled in blankets beside Frodo. "I had a funny dream an hour or two before we stopped, Mr. Frodo," he said. "Or maybe it wasn't a dream. Funny it was anyway."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天晚上，他们一群人挤在一个靠近东岸的小岛上。山姆裹在毯子里，睡在佛罗多身边。“在我们停船之前一两个小时我作了个怪梦，佛罗多先生，”他说：“或者那不是梦，但真的很好笑。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That I won't," said Sam." "Twas the eyes as made me sit up, so to speak. I saw what I took to be a log floating along in the half-light behind Gimli's boat; but I didn't give much heed to it. Then it seemed as if the log was slowly catching us up. And that was peculiar, as you might say, seeing as we were all floating on the stream together. Just then I saw the eyes: two pale sort of points, shiny-like, on a hump at the near end of the log. What's more, it wasn't a log, for it had paddle-feet, like a swan's almost, only they seemed bigger, and kept dipping in and out of the water.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我可不会这么做，”山姆说：“就是那双眼睛让我寒毛直竖，我看见了有个浮木漂在水面上，紧跟在金雳的小舟之后，我本来没有注意。然后，我发现那浮木似乎慢慢地追上我们。这实在太不合常理了，因为你知道我们都一起浮在同一条河上，没道理它的水会流得比较快……就在那个时候我看到了那双眼睛：一对白点，有着某种特殊的光芒，就在靠近浮木尾端树瘤的地方。而且，这好像又不是浮木，因为它有一双长蹼的脚，几乎像是天鹅的脚一样，只是看起来更大，一直在水中起起伏伏。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It wasn't funny that way, Mr. Frodo. It was queer. All wrong, if it wasn't a dream. And you had best hear it. It was like this: I saw a log with eyes! "</div>

Frodo was just yielding to the temptation to lie down again when a dark shape, hardly visible, floated close to one of the moored boats. A long whitish hand could be dimly seen as it shot out and grabbed the gunwale; two pale lamplike eyes shone coldly as they peered inside, and then they lifted and gazed up at Frodo on the eyot. They were not more than a yard or two away, and Frodo heard the soft hiss of intaken breath. He stood up, drawing Sting from its sheath, and faced the eyes. Immediately their light was shut off. There was another hiss and a splash, and the dark log-shape shot away downstream into the night. Aragorn stirred in his sleep, turned over, and sat up"</div>

If he was still following, he was very wary and cunning. At Aragorn's bidding they paddled now for long spells, and the banks went swiftly by. But they saw little of the country, for they journeyed mostly by night and twilight, resting by day, and lying as hidden as the land allowed.

<div class="line_en">The next day the country on either side began to change rapidly. The banks began to rise and grow stony. Soon they were passing through a hilly rocky land, and on both shores there were steep slopes buried in deep brakes of thorn and sloe, tangled with brambles and creepers. Behind them stood low crumbling cliffs, and chimneys of grey weathered stone dark with ivy; and beyond these again there rose high ridges crowned with wind-writhen firs. They were drawing near to the grey hill-country of the Emyn Muil, the southern march of Wilderland.</div>

Soon it appeared as a great winged creature, blacker than the pits in the night. Fierce voices rose up to greet it from across the water.

The distance is not great: the head of the Rapids is but half a mile below us, and they are little more than a mile long. Not far beyond them the stream becomes clear and smooth again, though it runs swiftly. Our hardest task will be to get our boats and baggage to the old portage-way. We have found it, but it lies well back from the water-side here, and runs under the lee of a rock-wall, a furlong or more from the shore. We did not find where the northward landing lies. If it still remains, we must have passed it yesterday night. We might labour far upstream and yet miss it in the fog.

<div class="line_en">The task proved hard indeed, yet in the end it was done. The goods were taken out of the boats and brought to the top of the bank, where there was a level space. Then the boats were drawn out of the water and carried up. They were far less heavy than any had expected. Of what tree growing in the elvish country they were made not even Legolas knew; but the wood was tough and yet strangely light. Merry and Pippin alone could carry their boat with ease along the flat. Nonetheless it needed the strength of the two Men to lift and haul them over the ground that the Company now had to cross. It sloped up away from the River, a tumbled waste of grey limestone-boulders, with many hidden holes shrouded with weeds and bushes; there were thickets of brambles, and sheer dells; and here and there boggy pools fed by waters trickling from the terraces further inland.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个任务果然十分艰难，但最后还是完成了。他们先将东西全都搬到岸上的平地，然后再把船只拖出水面，送到岸边，小舟本身比预料中的要轻多了。连勒苟拉斯都不知道这是用精灵国度中的什么木头雕凿的，但它们既坚韧、又轻，只要梅里和皮聘两人，就可以轻松地抬着它在平地跑。当然，要越过目前这样崎岖的地形，它们得要靠两名人类运送才行。一路上的坡度都很陡，还有诸多的岩石碎块挡住去路，两旁还有许多的杂草和荆棘构成浓密的遮蔽，中间穿有陡峭的河谷，以及许多装满了臭水的坑洞。">查看中文翻译</div>

Then with little further hindrance, save from sprawling briars and many fallen stones, they moved forward all together. Fog still hung in veils upon the crumbling rock-wall, and to their left mist shrouded the River: they could hear it rushing and foaming over the sharp shelves and stony teeth of Sarn Gebir, but they could not see it. Twice they made the journey, before all was brought safe to the southern landing.</div>

In the mid-morning the clouds drew down lower, and it began to rain heavily.

<div class="line_en">The rain, however, did not last long. Slowly the sky above grew lighter, and then suddenly the clouds broke, and their draggled fringes trailed away northward up the River. The fogs and mists were gone. Before the travellers lay a wide ravine, with great rocky sides to which clung, upon shelves and in narrow crevices, a few thrawn trees. The channel grew narrower and the River swifter. Now they were speeding along with little hope of stopping or turning, whatever they might meet ahead. Over them was a lane of pale-blue sky, around them the dark overshadowed River, and before them black, shutting out the sun, the hills of Emyn Muil, in which no opening could be seen.</div>

Then he saw that they were indeed shaped and fashioned: the craft and power of old had wrought upon them, and still they preserved through the suns and rains of forgotten years the mighty likenesses in which they had been hewn. Upon great pedestals founded in the deep waters stood two great kings of stone: still with blurred eyes and crannied brows they frowned upon the North. The left hand of each was raised palm outwards in gesture of warning; in each right hand there was an axe; upon each head there was a crumbling helm and crown. Great power and majesty they still wore, the silent wardens of a long-vanished kingdom. Awe and fear fell upon Frodo, and he cowered down, shutting his eyes and not daring to look up as the boat drew near. Even Boromir bowed his head as the boats whirled by. frail and fleeting as little leaves, under the enduring shadow of the sentinels of Numenor. So they passed into the dark chasm of the Gates.</div>

<div class="line_en">The chasm was long and dark, and filled with the noise of wind and rushing water and echoing stone. It bent somewhat towards the west so that at first all was dark ahead; but soon Frodo saw a tall gap of light before him, ever growing. Swiftly it drew near, and suddenly the boats shot through, out into a wide clear light.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="峡谷又长又黑暗，充斥着强风与潮水的奔腾声。它朝向西弯，一切突然变得黑暗，但很快地，佛罗多看见一道光芒射入，并且不断增强。突然间，小舟渡过了亚苟那斯峡，进入了明亮的天光照耀下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Behold Tol Brandir!" said Aragorn, pointing south to the tall peak. "Upon the left stands Amon Lhaw, and upon the right is Amon Hen the Hills of Hearing and of Sight. In the days of the great kings there were high seats upon them, and watch was kept there. But it is said that no foot of man or beast has ever been set upon Tol Brandir. Ere the shade of night falls we shall come to them. I hear the endless voice of Rauros calling."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这就是托尔布兰达！”阿拉贡指着南方的高大山峰说：“左边是阿蒙罗山，右边是阿蒙汉山——千里观听之山。在远古的年代里，国王们在其上建造座，并且时时驻守兵员在其上。但是，据说没有任何人或兽的脚步曾经踏上托尔布兰达。在黑夜降临之前，我们应该就可以走到山前，我已经听到拉洛斯瀑布呼唤的声音了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The sun, already long fallen from the noon, was shining in a windy sky. The pent waters spread out into a long oval lake, pale Nen Hithoel, fenced by steep grey hills whose sides were clad with trees, but their heads were bare, cold-gleaming in the sunlight. At the far southern end rose three peaks. The midmost stood somewhat forward from the others and sundered from them, an island in the waters, about which the flowing River flung pale shimmering arms. Distant but deep there came up on the wind a roaring sound like the roll of thunder heard far away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="太陽已经越过天顶，在微风吹拂的大地上照耀着。原先汹涌的河水现在流入一个椭圆形的湖中，那是苍白的兰西索湖，它的四周被山丘所环绕。山丘的四周生长着许多的树木，但顶端却光秃秃的沐浴在陽光下。在极南方有三座山峰升起，最中间的山峰有些前倾，距离其他的山峰也有段距离，大河绕过这座山峰分离开来。从遥远的地方传来轰隆隆的巨响，如同雷声一般。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The tenth day of their journey was over. Wilderland was behind them. They could go no further without choice between the east-way and the west. The last stage of the Quest was before them.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Company rested now for a while, drifting south on the current that flowed through the middle of the lake. They ate some food, and then they took to their paddles and hastened on their way. The sides of the westward hills fell into shadow, and the Sun grew round and red. Here and there a misty star peered out. The three peaks loomed before them, darkling in the twilight. Rauros was roaring with a great voice. Already night was laid on the flowing waters when the travellers came at last under the shadow of the hills.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一行人暂时休息了一下，沿着水流往南漂向湖中央。他们吃了一些食物，很快地又拿起桨，继续朝着目标前进。西方的山丘渐渐被陰影遮蔽，太陽开始慢慢落下，不甘寂寞的星辰悄悄跳出。三座山峰在暮色中依旧孤傲的挺立着，拉洛斯的怒吼并没有稍歇，当远征队终于来到山下的时候，夜色已然降临。">查看中文翻译</div>
