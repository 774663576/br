<div class="line_en">His mother, whom he loved, wearied of him sometimes. He thought only of himself. When he wanted amusement, all that stood in his way he hated, even if it were she. When he was in trouble he moaned to her ceaselessly.</div>

<div class="line_en">In appearance he remained the flower of the family, being well made, graceful, and full of life. His dark brown hair and fresh colouring, and his exquisite dark blue eyes shaded with long lashes, together with his generous manner and fiery temper, made him a favourite. But as he grew older his temper became uncertain. He flew into rages over nothing, seemed unbearably raw and irritable.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="论外表，他是家中的精华，身材匀称，风度优雅、充满活力，深棕色的头发、红润的脸色，敏锐的深蓝色的眼睛映衬着长长的睫毛，再加上慷慨大方的举止，暴躁的脾气，使他在家中倍受欢迎。但是，当他长大一点之后，他的脾气变的令人捉摸不定了。他无缘无故的大发脾气，粗暴无理，几乎让人不能忍受。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Arthur Morel was growing up. He was a quick, careless, impulsive boy, a good deal like his father. He hated study, made a great moan if he had to work, and escaped as soon as possible to his sport again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="亚瑟·莫瑞尔逐渐长大了。他是一个粗心大意、性情急躁、容易冲动的男孩，极像他的父亲。他讨厌学问，如果他不得不去干活，他就嘟囔半天，而且一有机会，他就溜出去玩。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Goodness, boy!" she said, when he groaned about a master who, he said, hated him, "if you don't like it, alter it, and if you can't alter it, put up with it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一次，当他抱怨说老师恨他时，母亲说：“天哪！孩子，如果你不想被别人恨，就改了吧；要是不能改变，你就忍着吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And his father, whom he had loved and who had worshipped him, he came to detest. As he grew older Morel fell into a slow ruin. His body, which had been beautiful in movement and in being, shrank, did not seem to ripen with the years, but to get mean and rather despicable. There came over him a look of meanness and of paltriness. And when the mean-looking elderly man bullied or ordered the boy about, Arthur was furious. Moreover, Morel's manners got worse and worse, his habits somewhat disgusting. When the children were growing up and in the crucial stage of adolescence, the father was like some ugly irritant to their souls. His manners in the house were the same as he used among the colliers down pit.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他过去爱父亲，父亲也疼爱过他。但现在他开始厌恶父亲了。在他渐渐地长大时，莫瑞尔也开始慢慢地衰弱了。他的身体，过去一举一动都那么优美，如今却萎缩了，似乎不是随着日月而成熟稳重，而是日趋卑鄙和无赖了。每当这个面目可憎的老头对亚瑟呼来喝去时，亚瑟就忍不住要发作。而且，莫瑞尔的举止变的越来越无所顾忌，他的一举一动也让人看不顺眼。孩子们长大了，正处在关键的青春期，父亲对他们的心灵来说是一种丑恶的刺激。他在家里的举止和他在井下和矿工们在一起时一个样，丝毫不变。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But for the threat and the fact that he did not try so hard as be imagined, they would have felt sorry. As it was, the battle now went on nearly all between father and children, he persisting in his dirty and disgusting ways, just to assert his independence. They loathed him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="实际上，他们对他并没有那么坏，而他也不是像他说的那么勤奋地工作。如果真是那样，他们倒会同情他的。现在，这几乎成了父亲和孩子们之间的争执，他坚持着自己不良的习惯和令人厌恶的生活方式，以此来表明他是独立不羁的，不受旁人支配的。因而，孩子们更加痛恨他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Dirty nuisance!" Arthur would cry, jumping up and going straight out of the house when his father disgusted him. And Morel persisted the more because his children hated it. He seemed to take a kind of satisfaction in disgusting them, and driving them nearly mad, while they were so irritably sensitive at the age of fourteen or fifteen. So that Arthur, who was growing up when his father was degenerate and elderly, hated him worst of all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“肮脏讨厌的东西！”亚瑟被父亲惹怒的时候，他就会这么大喊着，冲出屋子。而莫瑞尔因为孩子们讨厌他，他就越赌气胡来。惹得孩子们发狂的厌恶和愤怒，莫瑞尔似乎从中得到了一种满足。孩子们在十四、五岁时都特别容易冲动，而亚瑟就是在父亲堕落衰弱的过程中明白事理的，因此最恨他。">查看中文翻译</div>

The two shared lives.</div>

Morel sat all the time smoking his thick twist tobacco, watching her, and listening to her glib London speech, as he puffed. Mrs. Morel, dressed up in her best black silk blouse, answered quietly and rather briefly. The three children sat round in silence and admiration. Miss Western was the princess. Everything of the best was got out for her: the best cups, the best spoons, the best table cloth, the best coffee-jug. The children thought she must find it quite grand. She felt strange, not able to realise the people, not knowing how to treat them. William joked, and was slightly uncomfortable.</div>

As a rule, William and Lily and Paul went out in the morning together for a walk. William did not talk to his beloved much, except to tell her things from his boyhood. Paul talked endlessly to both of them. They lay down, all three, in a meadow by Minton Church. On one side, by the Castle Farm, was a beautiful quivering screen of poplars. Hawthorn was dropping from the hedges; penny daisies and ragged robin were in the field, like laughter. William, a big fellow of twenty-three, thinner now and even a bit gaunt, lay back in the sunshine and dreamed, while she fingered with his hair. Paul went gathering the big daisies. She had taken off her hat; her hair was black as a horse's mane. Paul came back and threaded daisies in her jet-black hair -- big spangles of white and yellow, and just a pink touch of ragged robin.</div>

I HAD to take her and get some warm things. Well, mother, I shouldn't mind the money if we had any.

At King's Cross still no one could tell her how to get to Elmers End. Carrying her string bag, that contained her nightdress, a comb and brush, she went from person to person.
