<div class="line_en">Standing in their bright and shiny new gowns, Anastasia and Drisella pretended to admire each other. The sisters had gotten dresses that matched in every way besides color. Anastasia's was a bright pink, Drisella's a loud yellow. Both had elaborate corsets that Ella had been forced to tie as tightly as possible.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Would you not like to know a bit about him before you marry him?" Ella asked, thinking of Kit and the way his dark brown hair had waved gently about his face.

<div class="line_cn" title="“你嫁给他之前都不想了解他一点儿吗？”瑞拉问道，她想着基特，想着他深褐色的头发轻拂着脸庞，想着他的微笑，想着他在自己面前紧张时结结巴巴的样子。她想多了解基特一些，她想了解他的一切。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A short while later, Lady Tremaine made her appearance at the top of the stairs. Unlike her daughters, whose bright dresses seemed garish and tacky, Lady Tremaine was the picture of refined elegance. Her emerald-green gown complemented her red hair, which was stylishly coiffed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不一会儿，特曼妮夫人出现在了楼梯顶端。和穿得花里胡哨、俗气十足的女儿们不同，特曼妮夫人显得高贵优雅。她翠绿色的礼服和红色的头发非常相配，她头上戴着时髦的帽子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She gracefully descended the staircase and came to a stop in front of her daughters. Looking them up and down, she appraised them with a critical eye. "My dear girls," she said, "to see you like this… it makes me believe that one of you may just snare the prince. And to think I have two horses in the race…" She kissed each of them on the cheek, then added, "I dare say no one in the kingdom will outshine my daughters."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她仪态万方地走下楼梯，在女儿们面前停住了。她用评判的眼光上下打量着她们。“亲爱的女儿们，”她说，“看到你们这样的打扮…我相信你们其中一位肯定能俘获王子的心。想到这场比赛中我有两匹赛马…”她亲了亲女儿们的脸颊说：“我敢说这个王国里谁也不会比我的女儿们更光彩照人。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then, from the landing at the top of the stairs, there came a rustle. As Lady Tremaine turned, her eyes grew narrow and her face flushed. Standing there, in a gown that was old-fashioned but infinitely more elegant than her daughters' new gowns, was Ella. Her face glowed with excitement, her eyes sparkling and her hair falling about her shoulders in perfect waves. She was, in a word, stunning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，楼梯顶端的转台上传来一阵窸窸窣窣的衣裙声。特曼妮夫人转过身，眯起眼睛，她的脸变得通红。上面站着的是瑞拉，她穿着一件礼服，虽然款式陈旧，但比她女儿们的新礼服优雅得多。瑞拉兴奋得满面红光，眼睛闪闪发亮，波浪形的长发垂落在肩头。总之，她美得惊人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Lady Tremaine took a deep breath and collected herself. The girl was far too beautiful. She needed to make sure Ella did not attend the ball under any circumstances, or Ella would undoubtedly outshine her daughters. After living with Ella for some time, she was not so foolish as to think anger would get through to the girl. No, she needed to manipulate Ella. Bringing a hand to her heart, Lady Tremaine said, "After all I've done -- feeding you, clothing you, resisting every impulse to turn you out of doors, you try to… to embarrass me in front of the court?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特曼妮夫人深吸了一口气，恢复了平静。这个女孩太漂亮了，她必须确保瑞拉无论如何都参加不了舞会，要不然她一定会抢了她女儿们的风头。和瑞拉一起生活了这么久，她知道发火是不会奏效的。不，她要巧妙地操纵她。特曼妮夫人一只手放到胸前说：“我为你做了这么多——给你饭吃，给你衣服穿，忍耐着没把你赶出家门，你就…就这么让我到王宫里出洋相吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Smiling nervously, Ella walked down the stairs. "It cost you nothing," she explained. "It's my mother's old dress, you see. And I took it up myself." She lifted the skirt of the dress to prove her point. She had spent every evening after her chores were done laboring over the dress. It had been painstaking work, but when she had finally seen herself in the small looking glass in her room, she had known it was worth it. She had only wished at that moment that her mother could have been there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="瑞拉紧张地笑着走下了楼梯。“没花你们一分钱，”她解释道，“你看，这是我母亲的旧衣服。我自己改了改。”她提起裙子证明自己说的不是假话。为了这件衣服，她每天晚上做完家里的杂活后都会缝缝补补。她确实费了不少功夫，但当她在房间里的小镜子里看到自己穿着它的样子，她觉得自己的心血没有白费。她只希望母亲此刻能在这里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="瑞拉吃了一惊。“我…我…我没想让你出洋相，”她支支吾吾地说，“我不是要去见王子——”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It is the king I am thinking of," Lady Tremaine shot back. "It would be an insult to the royal personage to take you to the palace in those old rags."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我就是想到国王才这么说的，”特曼妮夫人回道，“你穿得这样破破烂烂到王宫里去只会让王室蒙羞。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Lady Tremaine cut her off. "There's no question of you going… at all."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特曼妮夫人打断了她。“你根本就不能去。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But all of the maidens in the land are invited," Ella protested feebly. "By order of the king."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可是王国所有的少女都被邀请了，”瑞拉无力地抗议道，“这是国王的命令。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Rags," Ella repeated, the word sticking in her throat. She looked down at her mother's dress. It was one of the few reminders left of the woman who had filled this house with so much love. Bitter tears welled up in Ella's eyes and she rubbed them away. She didn't want them to see her cry. She needed to stay strong, in honor of the promises she'd made and the dress she wore.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“破破烂烂，”瑞拉重复着，这个词让她说不出话来。她低头看着母亲的衣服。母亲活着的时候让整个家充满了爱。她留下的东西不多，这衣服就是其中一件。瑞拉眼里满是痛苦的泪水，但她很快就把眼泪擦干了。她不想让她们看到自己流泪。她要坚强，为了自己许下的诺言，也为了身上的这件衣服。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Lady Tremaine seemed unbothered by the emotions racing across Ella's face. "This… thing…" she sneered, "is so out of style that it's practically falling to pieces. Look, the shoulder is frayed." Reaching out, Lady Tremaine pulled on the sleeve, hard. There was a loud rip and Ella gasped. But her stepmother wasn't done. She grabbed the shawl Ella had wrapped around her shoulders. Then she ripped that, too. Taking the cue from their mother, Anastasia and Drisella began to pull and tug at Ella as well. When they were done, the dress was destroyed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特曼妮夫人可没有被瑞拉难过的表情打动。“这个…东西…”她冷笑道，“太过时了，都快成碎片了。看，肩膀都磨破了。”她伸手抓住瑞拉的袖子，用力撕扯着。只听刺啦一声，瑞拉倒吸了一口气。但是继母还没有住手。她抓住瑞拉肩上披着的披肩，把它也撕碎了。安泰西亚和崔西里亚明白了母亲的提示，也冲上来开始又撕又扯。等他们停下的时候，瑞拉的衣服早已被撕得粉碎。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="瑞拉用胳膊护住自己的身体，心里又羞又恼。“你们怎么能这么做？”她用颤抖的声音问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"How could I otherwise?" Lady Tremaine retorted. "I will not have anyone associate my daughters with you. It would ruin their prospects to be seen arriving next to a ragged servant girl." She paused, leaning in close to Ella. "Mark my words. You shall not go to the ball."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我还能怎么做？”特曼妮夫人不依不饶地说。“我不允许任何人把你和我的女儿们扯在一起。和一个穿得破破烂烂的女仆一起参加舞会只会毁掉她们的前程。”她停下来，凑到瑞拉面前。“记住我的话：你不能去参加舞会。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Later, as her stepfamily's carriage faded from view, tears filled Ella's eyes and she sank to the ground. She would never see Kit again. And she knew that after that day, her stepmother's hold on her would only tighten. Ella shuddered. Her fate seemed locked. And for once, she couldn't find the courage to smile through her pain.</div>

<div class="line_en">Hearing footsteps behind her, Ella quickly wiped away her tears and turned. An old beggar woman stood there, leaning heavily on a gnarled wooden cane. The woman's clothes were rags and she looked ravenous. Ella felt a pang of guilt. This woman knew true hardship.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes, I think I can find something for you," Ella said, pushing herself to her feet. But the action made her mother's dress, already in shreds, rip further, and the tears she had been fighting to stop started again. Focusing on the task at hand, she rushed into the house and poured a large serving of milk into a bowl. Then she carried it out to the beggar woman.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好的，我应该能给你找点吃的。”瑞拉说着站了起来。但是母亲的衣服本来就被撕成了布条，这一起身又扯碎了一些，刚才强忍着的泪水又夺眶而出。但是想到要做的事情，她冲进门去倒了一大碗牛奶，然后端出来给了乞丐婆婆。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The old woman shook her head. "Nothing? What is a bowl of milk? Nothing. And everything. Kindness is so rare these days," she said, taking the bowl. She sipped the milk and smiled in satisfaction. "Thank you. Now, I don't mean to hurry you, but we haven't got long, Ella." The beggar woman began to walk around to the back of the house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="老婆婆摇摇头。“没什么？区区一碗牛奶算什么？也没什么，但又是一切。现在善良的人可不多。”说着她接过了碗，喝了一小口牛奶，满意地笑了。“谢谢你。好了，我不想催你，不过我们剩下的时间不多了，瑞拉。”乞丐婆婆开始朝屋后走去。">查看中文翻译</div>
