<div class="line_en">"That law was created to stop wizards passing on Dark artifacts," said Hermione, "and the Ministry is supposed to have powerful evidence that the deceased's possessions are illegal before seizing them!

<div class="line_cn" title="罗恩转脸看看哈利和赫敏，却见赫敏朝他丢了个“赶紧闭嘴！”的眼神，但是危害已经造成：斯克林杰似乎听到了他所期待和需要的话。他像饿鸟扑食似的扑向罗恩的回答。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This was stretching the truth to breaking point; as far as Harry knew, Ron and Dumbledore had never been alone together, and direct contact between them had been negligible. However, Scrimgeour did not seem to be listening. He put his hand inside his cloak and drew out a drawstring pouch much larger than the one Hagrid had given Harry. From it, he removed a scroll of parchment which he unrolled and read aloud.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这其实是夸大事实了。据哈利所知，罗恩和邓布利多从来没有单独在一起待过，他们之间的直接接触少得可怜。然而，斯克林杰似乎并没在听。他把手伸进斗篷里掏出一个拉绳小袋，比海格送给哈利的那个要大得多。他从里面抽出一卷羊皮纸，展开来大声读道：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Correct," said Scrimgeour. "A Snitch is not touched by bare skin before it is released, not even by the maker, who wears gloves. It carries an enchantment by which it can identify the first human to lay hands upon it, in case of a disputed capture. This Snitch" -- he held up the tiny golden ball -- "will remember your touch, Potter. It occurs to me that Dumbledore, who had prodigious magical skill, whatever his other faults, might have enchanted this Snitch so that it will open only for you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“正确，”斯克林杰说，“飞贼被放出来前，没有被裸露的皮肤触摸过，就连制造者也没有摸过，他们都戴着手套。飞贼身上带有一种魔法，它能辨认第一个用手触摸它的人，以防抓球时产生争议。这个飞贼——”他举起小小的金球，“——会记得你的触摸，波特。我突然想起，邓布利多虽然有这样那样的缺点，但魔法技艺却十分高超，他大概给这个飞贼施了魔法，只有你才能打开。”">查看中文翻译</div>
