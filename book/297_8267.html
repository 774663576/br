He had won his fight with Spitz and he wanted to be lead－dog.</div>

<div class="line_en">For an hour the two men tried to harness him. Buck did not run away, but he did not let them catch him. Finally, Francois sat down, and Perrault looked at his watch. It was getting late. The two men looked at one another and smiled Francois walked up to Sol-leks, took off his harness, led him back and harnessed him in his old place. Then he called Buck. All the other dogs were harnessed and the only empty place was now the one at the front But Buck did not move.</div>

<div class="line_en">Buck was an excellent leader. He moved and thought quick－ly and led the other dogs well. A new leader made no differ－ence to Dave and Sol-leks; they continued to pull hard. But the other dogs had had an easy life when Spitz was leading. They were surprised when Buck made them work hard and punished them for their mistakes Pike, the second dog, was usually lazy; but by the end of the first day he was pulling harder than he had ever pulled in his life. The first night in camp Buck fought Joe, another difficult dog, and after that there were no more problems with him. The team started to pull together, and to move faster and faster.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="巴克是个优秀的领队，他拉得很快而且反应敏捷，把别的狗也领导得很好。对戴夫和索拉克斯来说，新的领队对他们来说没有什么不同，他们仍然很卖力地拉着。但其余的狗在斯皮兹做领队时不卖力气，现在却惊奇地发现巴克迫使他们卖力工作，而一旦犯错就会受到惩罚。跑在第二位的狗派克总是偷懒。当第一天的工作结束时，他感觉在整整一生里都没这么卖过力气地拉过雪撬。宿营的第一个晚上，巴克对付了另一条总惹事的狗，乔。自此，他再也没找过麻烦。整个狗队齐心合力拉雪撬，越跑越快。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Two new men took Buck and his team back north on the long journey to Dawson, travelling with several other dog－teams. It was heavy work; the sledge was loaded with letters for the gold miners of Dawson. Buck did not like it, but he worked hard, and made the other dogs work hard, too. Each day was the same. They started early, before it was light, and at night they stopped and camped and the dogs ate. For the dogs this was the best part of the day, first eating, then resting by the fire.</div>

<div class="line_en">Buck liked to lie by the fire, looking at the burning wood. Sometimes he thought about Mr Miller's house in California. More of ten he remembered the man in the red coat and his club, the death of Curly, the fight with Spitz, and the good things that he had eaten But sometimes he remembered other things These were things that he remembered through his parents, and his parents parents, and all the dogs which had lived before him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sometimes as he lay there, he seemed to see, in a waking dream, a different fire. And he saw next to him, not the Indian cook, but another man, a man with shorter legs, and longer arms. This man had long hair and deep eyes, and madestrange noises in his throat He was very frightened of the dark, and looked around him all the time, holding a heavy stone in his hand. He wore the skin of an animal on his back, and Buck could see thick hair all over his body.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有时候他躺在那儿。他似乎在清醒的遐想中看到了另一堆火焰。他看见身边并不是那个印第安厨子而是另一个人。那个人腿短而臂长，深目长发，喉咙中发出古怪的声音。他非常惧怕黑暗，手里握着一块沉重的石头，左顾右盼。他的背上裹着兽皮，巴克可以看到他周身浓密的毛发。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Buck sat by the fire with this hairy man, and in the circling darkness beyond the fire he could see many eyes-the eyes of hungry animals waiting to attack.

<div class="line_en">When they reached Dawson, the dogs were tired, and needed a week's rest But in two days they were moving south again, with another heavy load of letters.

<div class="line_en">One day he started to fall down while in his harness. The sledge stopped, and the driver took him out of his harness. He wanted to give him a rest, and let him run free behind the sledge. But Dave did not want to stop working. He hated to see another dog doing his work, so he ran along beside the sledge, trying to push Sol-leks out of his place. When the sledge made its next stop, Dave bit through Sol-leks" harness and pushed him away. Then he stood there, in his old place in front of the sledge, waiting for his harness and the order to start pulling.</div>
