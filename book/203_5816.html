<div class="line_en">Haw looked down the dark passageway and was aware of his fear. What lay ahead? Was it empty? Or worse, were there dangers lurking? He began to imagine all kinds of frightening things that could happen to him. He was scaring himself to death.</div>

<div class="line_en">As he started running down the dark corridor he began to smile. Haw didn't realize it yet, but he was discovering what nourished his soul. He was letting go and trusting what lay ahead for him, even though he did not know exactly what it was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他跑向这条黑暗的走廊时，他笑了起来。唧唧还没有认识到这一点，但他觉得他的灵魂得到了丰富。他正在放开自己，对前景充满了信心，尽管他并不能确切地知道前面究竟有些什么。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then he laughed at himself. He realized his fears were making things worse. So he did what he would do if he wasn't afraid. He moved in a new direction.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="忽然，他又觉得自己真是可笑。他意识到，他的畏惧只会使事情变得更糟糕。于是，他采取了当他无所畏惧的时候会采取的行动。他朝一个新的方向跑去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Now he felt the cool breeze that was blowing in this part of the maze and it was refreshing. He took in some deep breaths and felt invigorated by the movement. Once he had gotten past his fear, it turned out to be more enjoyable than he once believed it could be.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，从迷宫中吹来习习的凉风，使人感到神清气爽。他深吸了一口气，不觉振作起来。一旦克服了自己的恐惧感，他觉得一切比原来自己想像的要好得多。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then he raced through the maze with greater strength and agility. Before long he spotted a Cheese Station and became excited as he noticed little pieces of New Cheese near the entrance.</div>

<div class="line_en">To make things even better, Haw started to paint a picture in his mind. He saw himself in great realistic detail, sitting in the middle of a pile of all his favorite cheeses-from Cheddar to Brie! He saw himself eating the many cheeses he liked, and he enjoyed what he saw. Then he imagined how much he would enjoy all their great tastes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="为了使事情更顺利地进行，他又开始在头脑中描绘一种景象。想像中，他在一种很棒的现实环境，坐在各种他喜欢的奶酪中间——有切达奶酪还有布里奶酪！他看见自己在吃许多他喜欢吃的奶酪。这样的景象使他获得一种享受，他想像着这些奶酪的滋味该是多么美啊！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They were types of Cheeses he had never seen before, but they looked great. He tried them and found that they were delicious. He ate most of the New Cheese bits that were available and put a few in his pocket to have later and perhaps share with Hem. He began to regain his strength.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是一些他从未见过的奶酪，但看起来挺不错。他尝了尝，真是美味啊！他吃掉了大部分能找到的小块奶酪，把剩下的放进口袋，以后也许可以和哼哼分享。他的体力也开始得到恢复。">查看中文翻译</div>
