<div class="line_en">He sat as still as he could on the narrow bench, with his hands crossed on his knee. He had already learned to sit still. If you made unexpected movements they yelled at you from the telescreen. But the craving for food was growing upon him. What he longed for above all was a piece of bread. He had an idea that there were a few breadcrumbs in the pocket of his overalls. It was even possible -- he thought this because from time to time something seemed to tickle his leg -- that there might be a sizeable bit of crust there. In the end the temptation to find out overcame his fear; he slipped a hand into his pocket.</div>

<div class="line_en">He was in a high-ceilinged windowless cell with walls of glittering white porcelain. Concealed lamps flooded it with cold light, and there was a low, steady humming sound which he supposed had something to do with the air supply. A bench, or shelf, just wide enough to sit on ran round the wall, broken only by the door and, at the end opposite the door, a lavatory pan with no wooden seat. There were four telescreens, one in each wall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他在一间天花板很高，但没有窗户的囚室里，墙面闪着白瓷一样的光。隐蔽着的灯发出冷冷的光线，有一种低沉持久的嗡嗡声，他以为多半跟换气装置有关。有一张长凳，或者一个支架，宽度刚好够坐，几乎绕墙一圈，只是到门口才断开，在门的对面，有个坐便器，但没有木头座位。室内有四个电幕，一面墙一个。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a dull aching in his belly. It had been there ever since they had bundled him into the closed van and driven him away.

He still did not know, probably never would know, whether it had been morning or evening when they arrested him. Since he was arrested he had not been fed.</div>

<div class="line_en">He sat still again, his hands crossed on his knee. Before being brought here he had been taken to another place which must have been an ordinary prison or a temporary lock-up used by the patrols. He did not know how long he had been there; some hours at any rate; with no clocks and no daylight it was hard to gauge the time. It was a noisy, evil-smelling place. They had put him into a cell similar to the one he was now in, but filthily dirty and at all times crowded by ten or fifteen people. The majority of them were common criminals, but there were a few political prisoners among them. He had sat silent against the wall, jostled by dirty bodies, too preoccupied by fear and the pain in his belly to take much interest in his surroundings, but still noticing the astonishing difference in demeanour between the Party prisoners and the others. The Party prisoners were always silent and terrified, but the ordinary criminals seemed to care nothing for anybody. They yelled insults at the guards, fought back fiercely when their belongings were impounded, wrote obscene words on the floor, ate smuggled food which they produced from mysterious hiding-places in their clothes, and even shouted down the telescreen when it tried to restore order. On the other hand some of them seemed to be on good terms with the guards, called them by nicknames, and tried to wheedle cigarettes through the spyhole in the door. The guards, too, treated the common criminals with a certain forbearance, even when they had to handle them roughly. There was much talk about the forced-labour camps to which most of the prisoners expected to be sent. It was "all right" in the camps, he gathered, so long as you had good contacts and knew the ropes. There was bribery, favouritism, and racketeering of every kind, there was homosexuality and prostitution, there was even illicit alcohol distilled from potatoes. The positions of trust were given only to the common criminals, especially the gangsters and the murderers, who formed a sort of aristocracy. All the dirty jobs were done by the politicals.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a constant come-and-go of prisoners of every description: drug-peddlers, thieves, bandits, black-marketeers, drunks, prostitutes. Some of the drunks were so violent that the other prisoners had to combine to suppress them. An enormous wreck of a woman, aged about sixty, with great tumbling breasts and thick coils of white hair which had come down in her struggles, was carried in, kicking and shouting, by four guards, who had hold of her one at each corner. They wrenched off the boots with which she had been trying to kick them, and dumped her down across Winston's lap, almost breaking his thigh-bones. The woman hoisted herself upright and followed them out with a yell of "F -- bastards!" Then, noticing that she was sitting on something uneven, she slid off Winston's knees on to the bench.</div>

<div class="line_en">It might be two or three hours ago that they had brought him here. The dull pain in his belly never went away, but sometimes it grew better and sometimes worse, and his thoughts expanded or contracted accordingly. When it grew worse he thought only of the pain itself, and of his desire for food. When it grew better, panic took hold of him. There were moments when he foresaw the things that would happen to him with such actuality that his heart galloped and his breath stopped. He felt the smash of truncheons on his elbows and iron-shod boots on his shins; he saw himself grovelling on the floor, screaming for mercy through broken teeth. He hardly thought of Julia. He could not fix his mind on her. He loved her and would not betray her; but that was only a fact, known as he knew the rules of arithmetic. He felt no love for her, and he hardly even wondered what was happening to her. He thought oftener of O'Brien, with a flickering hope. O'Brien might know that he had been arrested. The Brotherhood, he had said, never tried to save its members. But there was the razor blade; they would send the razor blade if they could. There would be perhaps five seconds before the guard could rush into the cell. The blade would bite into him with a sort of burning coldness, and even the fingers that held it would be cut to the bone. Everything came back to his sick body, which shrank trembling from the smallest pain. He was not certain that he would use the razor blade even if he got the chance. It was more natural to exist from moment to moment, accepting another ten minutes' life even with the certainty that there was torture at the end of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大约两三个小时前，他们被带到这儿。他肚子的隐痛没有消失，但时而和缓时而加剧，他的思绪也随之起伏。肚子疼得厉害时，他只想到疼痛本身，也渴望食物。不那么疼痛时，他就感到恐慌。有时候，他预想将要发生的事情，想得很逼真，以致心跳加速，呼吸困难。他感觉到警棍击碎了他的手关节，钉了铁掌的皮靴踢他的小腿；他看见自己在地上打滚，含着碎牙喊救命。他几乎没有想到朱丽亚。他无法在她身上集中心思。他爱她，不会出卖她；但那只是一个事实，他知道这一点，就像他知道算术规则一样。他感觉不到对她的爱，甚至都想不到她怎么样了。他更多地想到奥布莱恩，怀着一丝希望。奥布莱恩肯定知道他被捕了。他说过，兄弟会从不设法保护它的成员。但有刀片，如果有可能，他们会送刀片进来。在卫兵冲进牢房时，也许会有五秒钟的时间。冰冷的刀片割进肉里，甚至拿刀片的手指也会被伤到骨头。他不适的身体要承受一切，就是最小的疼痛也会让他颤抖退缩。他不能肯定他是否会使用这刀片，即使他有机会。最好是任其自然，活一刻是一刻，接受哪怕只有十分钟的生命，即使生命的尽头肯定会有酷刑。">查看中文翻译</div>

A young officer, a trim black-uniformed figure who seemed to glitter all over with polished leather, and whose pale, straight-featured face was like a wax mask, stepped smartly through the doorway. He motioned to the guards outside to bring in the prisoner they were leading. The poet Ampleforth shambled into the cell. The door clanged shut again.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sometimes he tried to calculate the number of porcelain bricks in the walls of the cell. It should have been easy, but he always lost count at some point or another. More often he wondered where he was, and what time of day it was. At one moment he felt certain that it was broad daylight outside, and at the next equally certain that it was pitch darkness. In this place, he knew instinctively, the lights would never be turned out. It was the place with no darkness: he saw now why O'Brien had seemed to recognize the allusion. In the Ministry of Love there were no windows. His cell might be at the heart of the building or against its outer wall; it might be ten floors below ground, or thirty above it. He moved himself mentally from place to place, and tried to determine by the feeling of his body whether he was perched high in the air or buried deep underground.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ampleforth made one or two uncertain movements from side to side, as though having some idea that there was another door to go out of, and then began to wander up and down the cell. He had not yet noticed Winston's presence. His troubled eyes were gazing at the wall about a metre above the level of Winston's head. He was shoeless; large, dirty toes were sticking out of the holes in his socks. He was also several days away from a shave. A scrubby beard covered his face to the cheekbones, giving him an air of ruffianism that went oddly with his large weak frame and nervous movements.</div>

I could not help it!" he added almost indignantly, raising his face to look at Winston. "It was impossible to change the line. The rhyme was 'rod'.

<div class="line_en">They talked desultorily for some minutes, then, without apparent reason, a yell from the telescreen bade them be silent. Winston sat quietly, his hands crossed. Ampleforth, too large to sit in comfort on the narrow bench, fidgeted from side to side, clasping his lank hands first round one knee, then round the other. The telescreen barked at him to keep still. Time passed. Twenty minutes, an hour -- it was difficult to judge. Once more there was a sound of boots outside. Winston's entrails contracted. Soon, very soon, perhaps in five minutes, perhaps now, the tramp of boots would mean that his own turn had come.</div>

His mind sagged round and round on the same trick, like a ball falling again and again into the same series of slots. He had only six thoughts. The pain in his belly; a piece of bread; the blood and the screaming; O'Brien; Julia; the razor blade. There was another spasm in his entrails, the heavy boots were approaching.

<div class="line_en">The man sat down on the bench at a little distance from Winston. Winston did not look at him again, but the tormented, skull-like face was as vivid in his mind as though it had been straight in front of his eyes. Suddenly he realized what was the matter. The man was dying of starvation. The same thought seemed to occur almost simultaneously to everyone in the cell. There was a very faint stirring all the way round the bench. The eyes of the chinless man kept flitting towards the skull-faced man, then turning guiltily away, then being dragged back by an irresistible attraction. Presently he began to fidget on his seat. At last he stood up, waddled clumsily across the cell, dug down into the pocket of his overalls, and, with an abashed air, held out a grimy piece of bread to the skull-faced man.</div>

He took his stand opposite the chinless man, and then, at a signal from the officer, let free a frightful blow, with all the weight of his body behind it, full in the chinless man's mouth. The force of it seemed almost to knock him clear of the floor. His body was flung across the cell and fetched up against the base of the lavatory seat. For a moment he lay as though stunned, with dark blood oozing from his mouth and nose. A very faint whimpering or squeaking, which seemed unconscious, came out of him.

<div class="line_en">A long time passed. If it had been midnight when the skull-faced man was taken away, it was morning: if morning, it was afternoon. Winston was alone, and had been alone for hours. The pain of sitting on the narrow bench was such that often he got up and walked about, unreproved by the telescreen. The piece of bread still lay where the chinless man had dropped it. At the beginning it needed a hard effort not to look at it, but presently hunger gave way to thirst. His mouth was sticky and evil-tasting. The humming sound and the unvarying white light induced a sort of faintness, an empty feeling inside his head. He would get up because the ache in his bones was no longer bearable, and then would sit down again almost at once because he was too dizzy to make sure of staying on his feet. Whenever his physical sensations were a little under control the terror returned. Sometimes with a fading hope he thought of O'Brien and the razor blade. It was thinkable that the razor blade might arrive concealed in his food, if he were ever fed. More dimly he thought of Julia. Somewhere or other she was suffering perhaps far worse than he. She might be screaming with pain at this moment. He thought: "If I could save Julia by doubling my own pain, would I do it? Yes, I would." But that was merely an intellectual decision, taken because he knew that he ought to take it. He did not feel it. In this place you could not feel anything, except pain and foreknowledge of pain. Besides, was it possible, when you were actually suffering it, to wish for any reason that your own pain should increase? But that question was not answerable yet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="又过了很久。如果骷髅脸男人被带走是半夜的话，现在就是上午了，如果他被带走时是上午的话，现在就是下午。温斯顿一个人，他独自一人已经几个小时了。坐在窄凳上坐得屁股疼，他不得不时不时站起，走动一下，尽管遭到电幕的反对。尖下巴男人丢下的那片面包仍在地板上。起先需要很大的努力才能不看它，但现在饥饿让位于干渴。他口里黏黏的，味道难闻。嗡嗡的声音和没有变化的白晃晃的灯光令他眩晕，脑子里空空荡荡。他想站起来，因为骨头的疼痛难以忍受，接着，他又会几乎马上就坐下来，因为他头晕目眩，支撑不住。每当他身体的感觉可以控制一些，恐惧又回来了。有时，带着朦胧的希望，他想起奥布莱恩和刀片。他猜想刀片可能会藏在他的饭食中，如果他还有饭吃的话。他也模糊地想到了朱丽亚。她正在某个地方受罪，也许比他更糟糕。此刻，她可能正痛得大声哭喊。他想：“如果我的痛苦加倍能救她的话，我愿意吗？是的，我愿意。”但那只是一个精神上的决定，他之所以能作这个决定，只因为他知道他应该作这个决定。但他并没有具体的感觉。在这个地方，你感觉不到什么，除了疼痛和对疼痛的预感。另外，当你实际上经受痛苦时，有可能出于任何理由让你自己的痛苦增加吗？但这个问题一时没有答案。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The two sturdy guards had stooped to take him by the arms. But just at this moment he flung himself across the floor of the cell and grabbed one of the iron legs that supported the bench. He had set up a wordless howling, like an animal. The guards took hold of him to wrench him loose, but he clung on with astonishing strength. For perhaps twenty seconds they were hauling at him. The prisoners sat quiet, their hands crossed on their knees, looking straight in front of them. The howling stopped; the man had no breath left for anything except hanging on. Then there was a different kind of cry. A kick from a guard's boot had broken the fingers of one of his hands. They dragged him to his feet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那两个强壮的卫兵弯腰抓住他的胳膊。但就在这时，他猛地摔在牢房的地板上，抓住了支撑长凳的一条铁腿。他像动物一样发出无声的嚎叫。卫兵抓住他想把他拧松，但他以惊人的力量紧紧抓住。他们朝他拖了大概二十秒钟。囚犯们安静地坐着，双手交叉放在膝盖上，直视着他们的前方。嚎叫声停止了，那人除了坚持住什么也没有了呼吸。然后是另一种哭泣。一个警卫的靴子踢断了他的一只手的手指。他们把他拖起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Winston started to his feet. The shock of the sight had driven all caution out of him. For the first time in many years he forgot the presence of the telescreen.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“他们把你也抓起来了！”他叫道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"They got me a long time ago," said O'Brien with a mild, almost regretful irony. He stepped aside. From behind him there emerged a broad-chested guard with a long black truncheon in his hand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他们很久以前就抓住我了，”奥布莱恩以一种平淡的、几乎是遗憾的讽刺语气说。他走到一边，从他身后出现一个魁梧的警卫，手里拿着一根黑色的长警棍。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The elbow! He had slumped to his knees, almost paralysed, clasping the stricken elbow with his other hand. Everything had exploded into yellow light. Inconceivable, inconceivable that one blow could cause such pain! The light cleared and he could see the other two looking down at him. The guard was laughing at his contortions. One question at any rate was answered. Never, for any reason on earth, could you wish for an increase of pain. Of pain you could wish only one thing: that it should stop. Nothing in the world was so bad as physical pain. In the face of pain there are no heroes, no heroes, he thought over and over as he writhed on the floor, clutching uselessly at his disabled left arm.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="手关节！他猛地蹲了下来，几乎瘫掉，用另一只手紧紧护着被打的手关节。一切都炸开化为一道黄光。不可思议，真是不可思议，一只手关节会痛成这样！黄光消失了，他看见那两个人低头看着他。警卫嘲笑他扭歪的脸。不管怎样，一个问题得到了回答。不管出于什么理由，你永远不希望增加痛苦。对于痛苦，你所希望的只有一件事：不再痛苦。世界上没有比肉体的痛苦更坏的事了。面对痛苦，没有英雄，没有英雄。当他在地上扭动身子时，他反复这么想，徒劳地抓住那只打残了的左臂。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yes, he saw now, he had always known it. But there was no time to think of that. All he had eyes for was the truncheon in the guard's hand. It might fall anywhere; on the crown, on the tip of the ear, on the upper arm, on the elbow --</div>
