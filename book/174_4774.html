<div class="line_en">But you simply must fit, and Peter measures you for your tree as carefully as for a suit of clothes: the only difference being that the clothes are made to fit you, while you have to be made to fit the tree. Usually it is done quite easily, as by your wearing too many garments or too few, but if you are bumpy in awkward places or the only available tree is an odd shape, Peter does some things to you, and after that you fit. Once you fit, great care must be taken to go on fitting, and this, as Wendy was to discover to her delight, keeps a whole family in perfect condition.</div>

<div class="line_en">One of the first things Peter did next day was to measure Wendy and John and Michael for hollow trees. Hook, you remember, had sneered at the boys for thinking they needed a tree apiece, but this was ignorance, for unless your tree fitted you it was difficult to go up and down, and no two of the boys were quite the same size. Once you fitted, you drew in (let out) your breath at the top, and down you went at exactly the right speed, while to ascend you drew in and let out alternately, and so wriggled up. Of course, when you have mastered the action you are able to do these things without thinking of them, and nothing can be more graceful.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天，彼得做的头一件事是给温迪、约翰和迈克尔量身材，好给他们几个找合适的空心树。你也许还记得，胡克曾经嘲笑孩子们每人有一株空心树；其实，糊涂的是他。因为，除非那株树适合你的身材，上下是很困难的；而孩子的身材没有两个是相同的。树要是合适，下去时，你只消吸一口气，就能不快不慢地往下滑；上来时，你只消交替着一呼一吸，就能蠕动着爬上来。当然，你熟悉了这套动作后，就能不假思索地上下自如，姿态真是再优美不过了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After a few days' practice they could go up and down as gaily as buckets in a well. And how ardently they grew to love their home under the ground; especially Wendy. It consisted of one large room, as all houses should do, with a floor in which you could dig (for worms) if you wanted to go fishing, and in this floor grew stout mushrooms of a charming colour, which were used as stools. A Never tree tried hard to grow in the centre of the room, but every morning they sawed the trunk through, level with the floor. By tea-time it was always about two feet high, and then they put a door on top of it, the whole thus becoming a table; as soon as they cleared away, they sawed off the trunk again, and thus there was more room to play. There was an enourmous fireplace which was in almost any part of the room where you cared to light it, and across this Wendy stretched strings, made of fibre, from which she suspended her washing. The bed was tilted against the wall by day, and let down at 6:30, when it filled nearly half the room; and all the boys slept in it, except Michael, lying like sardines in a tin. There was a strict rule against turning round until one gave the signal, when all turned at once. Michael should have used it also, but Wendy would have (desired) a baby, and he was the littlest, and you know what women are, and the short and long of it is that he was hung up in a basket.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="练了几天以后，他们就能像井里的水桶一样上下自如了。他们渐渐地都热烈地爱上了这个地下的家，特别是温迪。这个家像所有的家一样，有一间大厅；大厅的地面，要是你想钓鱼，就可以挖一个坑；地上还长着五颜六色的蘑菇，可以当凳子坐。有一棵永无树死气白赖要在房中央长出来，可是，每天早晨，孩子们把它齐地面锯掉。到吃茶点的时候，它已经长到两英尺高，他们在树干上支上一块门板，正好当作一张大桌子；茶点一吃完，他们又把树干锯掉，于是，屋子里又有宽敞的地方来做游戏了。屋里有一个极大的壁炉，几乎占满了整个屋子的各个部分，你愿意在哪儿生火都行。温迪在炉前拴上许多用植物纤维搓成的绳子，她把洗净的衣裳晾在上面。床铺白天就靠墙斜立着，到六点半钟时才放下来，这时候，床铺几乎占去了半间屋子。除迈克尔外，所有的孩子都睡在这张床上，一个挨一个躺着，像罐头里的沙丁鱼一样。翻身有严重的规定，由一个人发号令，大家一齐翻身。迈克尔本也可以睡在床上，但是温迪要有一个男婴，他最小，女人的心意你们是知道的；末了，迈克尔就给放在一只篮子里，挂了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was rough and simple, and not unlike what baby bears would have made of an underground house in the same circumstances. But there was one recess in the wall, no larger than a bird-cage, which was the private apartment of Tinker Bell. It could be shut off from the rest of the house by a tiny curtain, which Tink, who was most fastidious (particular), always kept drawn when dressing or undressing. No woman, however large, could have had a more exquisite boudoir (dressing room) and bed-chamber combined. The couch, as she always called it, was a genuine Queen Mab, with club legs; and she varied the bedspreads according to what fruit- blossom was in season. Her mirror was a Puss-in-Boots, of which there are now only three, unchipped, known to fairy dealers; the washstand was Pie-crust and reversible, the chest of drawers an authentic Charming the Sixth, and the carpet and rugs the best (the early) period of Margery and Robin. There was a chandelier from Tiddlywinks for the look of the thing, but of course she lit the residence herself. Tink was very contemptuous of the rest of the house, as indeed was perhaps inevitable, and her chamber, though beautiful, looked rather conceited, having the appearance of a nose permanently turned up.</div>

<div class="line_en">I suppose it was all especially entrancing to Wendy, because those rampagious boys of hers gave her so much to do. Really there were whole weeks when, except perhaps with a stocking in the evening, she was never above ground. The cooking, I can tell you, kept her nose to the pot, and even if there was nothing in it, even if there was no pot, she had to keep watching that it came aboil just the same. You never exactly knew whether there would be a real meal or just a make-believe, it all depended upon Peter's whim: he could eat, really eat, if it was part of a game, but he could not stodge (cram down the food) just to feel stodgy (stuffed with food), which is what most children like better than anything else; the next best thing being to talk about it. Make-believe was so real to him that during a meal of it you could see him getting rounder. Of course it was trying, but you simply had to follow his lead, and if you could prove to him that you were getting loose for your tree he let you stodge.</div>

<div class="line_en">As time wore on did she think much about the beloved parents she had left behind her? This is a difficult question, because it is quite impossible to say how time does wear on in the Neverland, where it is calculated by moons and suns, and there are ever so many more of them than on the mainland. But I am afraid that Wendy did not really worry about her father and mother; she was absolutely confident that they would always keep the window open for her to fly back by, and this gave her complete ease of mind. What did disturb her at times was that John remembered his parents vaguely only, as people he had once known, while Michael was quite willing to believe that she was really his mother. These things scared her a little, and nobly anxious to do her duty, she tried to fix the old life in their minds by setting them examination papers on it, as like as possible to the ones she used to do at school. The other boys thought this awfully interesting, and insisted on joining, and they made slates for themselves, and sat round the table, writing and thinking hard about the questions she had written on another slate and passed round. They were the most ordinary questions -- "What was the colour of Mother's eyes? Which was taller, Father or Mother? Was Mother blonde or brunette? Answer all three questions if possible." "(A) Write an essay of not less than 40 words on How I spent my last Holidays, or The Carakters of Father and Mother compared. Only one of these to be attempted." Or "(1) Describe Mother's laugh; (2) Describe Father's laugh; (3) Describe Mother's Party Dress; (4) Describe the Kennel and its Inmate."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="时光一天天过去，温迪难道不想念远离的亲爱的父母吗？这个问题很难回答，因为在永无乡到底过了多少时光，谁也说不清，时光是按月亮和太阳计算的；而岛上的太阳和月亮，比在内陆多得多。不过，我估摸温迪不会十分挂念她的父母，她有绝对的信心，他们一定会随时打开窗子，等着她飞回去，因此，她觉得很安心。她感到有点不安的是，约翰只是模模糊糊地记得父母，就像他们是他曾经认识的什么人；迈克尔呢，他倒很情愿相信，温迪真的是他的母亲。对这事她有点害怕了，于是她英勇地负起了责任。她用考试的方法，尽可能仿照她过去在学校里考试的情况，想在他们心里唤起对旧日的回忆。别的孩子觉得这有趣极了，硬是要参加考试。他们自备了石板，围坐在桌旁。温迪用另一块石板写下问题，给他们传看。他们看了问题，都用心想，用心写。这些问题都很平常：——“母亲的眼睛是什么颜色？母亲和父亲谁高？母亲的头发是浅色还是深色？可能的话，三题都答。” ——“写一篇不少于四十个字的文章，题目是：我怎样度过上次的假期，或比较父亲和母亲的性格。两题任答一题。”——“1．描写母亲的笑；2．描写父亲的笑；3．描写母亲的宴会礼服；4．描写狗舍和舍内的狗。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Adventures, of course, as we shall see, were of daily occurrence; but about this time Peter invented, with Wendy's help, a new game that fascinated him enormously, until he suddenly had no more interest in it, which, as you have been told, was what always happened with his games. It consisted in pretending not to have adventures, in doing the sort of thing John and Michael had been doing all their lives, sitting on stools flinging balls in the air, pushing each other, going out for walks and coming back without having killed so much as a grizzly. To see Peter doing nothing on a stool was a great sight; he could not help looking solemn at such times, to sit still seemed to him such a comic thing to do. He boasted that he had gone walking for the good of his health. For several suns these were the most novel of all adventures to him; and John and Michael had to pretend to be delighted also; otherwise he would have treated them severely.</div>

<div class="line_en">He often went out alone, and when he came back you were never absolutely certain whether he had had an adventure or not. He might have forgotten it so completely that he said nothing about it; and then when you went out you found the body; and, on the other hand, he might say a great deal about it, and yet you could not find the body. Sometimes he came home with his head bandaged, and then Wendy cooed over him and bathed it in lukewarm water, while he told a dazzling tale. But she was never quite sure, you know. There were, however, many adventures which she knew to be true because she was in them herself, and there were still more that were at least partly true, for the other boys were in them and said they were wholly true. To describe them all would require a book as large as an English-Latin, Latin- English Dictionary, and the most we can do is to give one as a specimen of an average hour on the island. The difficulty is which one to choose. Should we take the brush with the redskins at Slightly Gulch? It was a sanguinary (cheerful) affair, and especially interesting as showing one of Peter's peculiarities, which was that in the middle of a fight he would suddenly change sides. At the Gulch, when victory was still in the balance, sometimes leaning this way and sometimes that, he called out, "I'm redskin to-day; what are you, Tootles?" And Tootles answered, "Redskin; what are you, Nibs?" and Nibs said, "Redskin; what are you Twin?" and so on; and they were all redskins; and of course this would have ended the fight had not the real redskins fascinated by Peter's methods, agreed to be lost boys for that once, and so at it they all went again, more fiercly than ever.</div>

That is a pretty story, and the end shows how grateful a bird cam be; but if we tell it we must also tell the whole adventure of the lagoon, which would of course be telling two adventures rather than just one. A shorter adventure, and quite as exciting, was Tinker Bell's attempt, with the help of some street fairies, to have the sleeping Wendy conveyed on a great floating leaf to the mainland. Fortunately the leaf gave way and Wendy woke, thinking it was bath-time, and swam back. Or again, we might choose Peter's defiance of the lions, when he drew a circle round him on the ground with an arrow and dared them to cross it; and though he waited for hours, with the other boys and Wendy looking on breathlessly from trees, not one of them dared to accept his challenge.</div>
