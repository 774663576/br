<div class="line_cn" title="警官梅因笑了。“要是您认识莫里斯，您就知道这是根本不可能的事情！他惯会做假账，连全国最好的会计师都能被他蒙骗过去。我们在本尼托那个案子里已经领教过了。他把他雇主的账面简直搞得天衣无缝。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，是的，阁下。我们知道点儿他的事。他的名声不很好。三年以前和本尼托公司那次兜售假股票的案子有牵连——虽然我们没能找到确凿的证据，但这一点还是肯定的。他还参与过贩毒，但同样我们也没能抓住他什么把柄。莫里斯这个人办这种事非常小心。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Maine shrugged his shoulders. He said: "You're forgetting, sir, that Indian Island previously belonged to young Elmer Robson, the American. He had the most extraordinary parties down there. I've no doubt the local people's eyes fairly popped out over them. But they got used to it and they'd begun to feel that anything to do with Indian Island would necessarily be incredible. It's natural, that, sir, when you come to think of it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="梅因耸耸肩说：“阁下，您忽略了一件事：印第安岛本来是艾尔默·罗伯逊先生的财产。那个美国人什么样奇特的宴会都举办过。开始的时候，毫无疑问，当地的人看到岛上的事感到眼花缭乱，可是慢慢地他们也就习惯了。岛上再发生什么奇特古怪的花样他们也都熟视无睹了。您如果仔细想一想，阁下，这倒也是很自然的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The other man sighed. Inspector Maine went on: "It was Morris who made all the arrangements down at Sticklehaven, Represented himself as acting for 'Mr. Owen.' And it was he who explained to the people down there that there was some experiment on -- some bet about living on a 'desert island' for a week -- and that no notice was to be taken of any appeal for help from out there."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="副专员叹了口气。警官梅因继续说道：“同斯蒂克尔海文联系、实排各项事务都是莫里斯。也正是他，作为欧文先生的代理人，向那里的人们解释，岛上正进行一场赌赛，看看能不能在这个荒岛上住一个星期。因此岛上如果发出任何求援信号，斯蒂克尔海文镇的居民都不要理会。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Maine said: "Fred Narracott -- that's the man who took the party out there -- did say one thing that was illuminating. He said he was surprised to see what sort of people these were. 'Not at all like Mr. Robson's parties.' I think it was the fact that they were all so normal and so quiet that made him override Morris' orders and take out a boat to the island after he'd heard about the SOS signals."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="梅因说：“弗雷德·纳拉科特——就是把这群人送上岛去的那个开摩托艇的人——他倒说了一件对我们有些启发的事。他说他看见这群人的时候大吃一惊，完全不像罗伯逊先生的客人。我想正是因为他觉得这些人都是普普通通的人，都很不起眼，所以在他听到求援的信号的事以后，才违背了莫里斯先生的指示，驾着船到岛上去了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

There was a big sea on after the storm."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“信号是一群童子军在十一日早晨发现的。那天不可能出海。他们是在十二日下午风暴刚刚平息一点以后马上就出海的。他们一点都没耽搁，所以绝对不会有人在他们登岸之前从岛上溜走。暴风雨过后海上总是波涛汹涌。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Maine took a deep breath. "Dr. Armstrong now. Well-known man. Had a consulting room in Harley Street. Absolutely straight and aboveboard in his profession. Haven't been able to trace any record of an illegal operation or anything of that kind. It's true that there was a woman called Clees who was operated on by him way back in 1925 at Leithmore, when he was attached to the hospital there. Peritonitis and she died on the operating table. Maybe he wasn't very skillful over the op. -- after all he hadn't much experience -- but after all clumsiness isn't a criminal offence. There was certainly no motive."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="梅因深深吸了口气：“阿姆斯特朗是位名医，在哈里大街有个诊所。职业方面无可指摘。没能发现唱片上指控的那种医疗事故。不过追溯到一九二五年，他确实在莱特莫尔医院给一个叫做克利斯的女人动过手术。她得的是腹膜炎，死在手术台上了。或许他当时对这种手术不够熟练——经验不多——技艺不精，终究算不上是犯罪。这里面肯定不存有动机的问题。”">查看中文翻译</div>

"Young Marston was a fairly reckless car driver -- had his license endorsed twice and he ought to have been prohibited from driving, in my opinion. That's all there is to him.

<div class="line_en">Maine said earnestly: "We thought of that, sir. We went into it. Now, to begin with, we're not quite in the dark as to what happened on Indian Island. Vera Claythorne kept a diary, so did Emily Brent. Old Wargrave made some notes -- dry legal cryptic stuff, but quite clear. And Blore made notes too. All those accounts tally. The deaths occurred in this order: Marston, Mrs. Rogers, Macarthur, Rogers, Miss Brent, Wargrave. After his death Vera Claythorne's diary states that Armstrong left the house in the night and that Blore and Lombard had gone after him. Blore has one more entry in his notebook. Just two words: 'Armstrong disappeared.'"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Now, sir, it seemed to me, taking everything into account, that we might find here a perfectly good solution. Armstrong was drowned, you remember. Granting that Armstrong was mad, what was to prevent him having killed off all the others and then committed suicide by throwing himself over the cliff, or perhaps while trying to swim to the mainland?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“阁下，根据这些记载，我们似乎可以得出这样一个可以解释这一疑案的结论。阿姆斯特朗是淹死的，这一点谅您还记得。假定阿姆斯特朗是疯子，他完全有可能杀死其余的那些人以后自己跳崖自杀。或者死于泅水游往陆地的途中。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That was a good solution -- but it won't do. No, sir, it won't do. First of all there's the police surgeon's evidence. He got to the island early on the morning of August 13th. He couldn't say much to help us. All he could say was that all the people had been dead at least thirty-six hours and probably a good deal longer. But he was fairly definite about Armstrong. Said he must have been from eight to ten hours in the water before his body was washed up. That works out at this, that Armstrong must have gone into the sea sometime during the night of the 10th-11th -- and I'll explain why. We found the point where the body was washed up -- it had been wedged between two rocks and there were bits of cloth, hair, etc. on them. It must have been deposited there at high water on the 11th -- that's to say round about 11 o'clock A. M. After that, the storm subsided, and succeeding high water marks are considerably lower."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这个结论看来还说得过去——但可惜它不能成立。是的，阁下，完全不能成立。首先，根据法医的检验结果，法医是在八月十三日清晨到达岛上的——这些人至少都死了三十六小时以上了，或许比三十六小时更长些。法医所能判定的也就是这个。但是他肯定认为阿姆斯特朗的尸体是在水中浸泡了八至十个小时以后才冲刷到岸上来的。由此可以推断，阿姆斯特朗一定是在十日至十一日夜间某一时刻掉进大海的。我来解释一下为什么要这么说。我们找到了尸体冲上来的地方——尸体卡在两块礁石之间，石头上还挂着一些碎衣服和头发等等。他一定是在十一号夜间涨潮时搁置到这里来的，也就是说在十一点左右。在这以后，风暴就停了，后来最高的水印要比这里低得多。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He paused and then went on."And that leaves -- just what exactly? Here's the position early on the morning of the 11th. Armstrong has 'disappeared' (drowned). That leaves us three people. Lombard, Blore and Vera Claythorne. Lombard was shot. His body was down by the sea -- near Armstrong's. Vera Claythorne was found hanged in her own bedroom. Blore's body was on the terrace. His head was crushed in by a heavy marble clock that it seems reasonable to suppose fell on him from the window above."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他停顿了一下继续说：“这件事究竟该怎样解释呢？十一日清晨的情况是这样的：阿姆斯特朗失踪（淹死）了，还剩下三个人，隆巴德、布洛尔和维拉·克莱索恩。隆巴德是被枪杀的。他的尸体也在海边。就在阿姆斯特朗尸体的近旁。维拉·克莱索恩被发现吊死在自己的房间里。布洛尔的尸体在露台上，脑袋被一大块大理石砸碎，大理石显然是从上面窗户里扔下来的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
