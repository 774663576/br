<div class="line_en">Wendy ran down the hall in her stocking feet and ran down the main stairs to the lobby two at a time. She didn't look up at the carpeted flight that led to the second floor, but if she had, she would have seen Danny standing at the top of them, still and silent, his unfocused eyes directed out into indifferent space, his thumb in his mouth, the collar and shoulders of his shirt damp. There were puffy bruises on his neck and just below his chin.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jack's cries had ceased, but that did nothing to ease her fear. Ripped out of her sleep by his voice, raised in that old hectoring pitch she remembered so well, she still felt that she was dreaming-but another part knew she was awake, and that terrified her more. She half-expected to burst into the office and find him standing over Danny's sprawled-out body, drunk and confused.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰克的叫声停止了，但她的恐惧并未因此而缓解。他的叫声打破了她的睡梦，她很熟悉那种令人惊惧的调门，醒来时以为自己仍在梦中——但另一部分意识知道她醒了，她因此感到更加恐怖，心想，撞进办公室后，她也许会发现杰克站在丹尼瘫倒的尸体旁，酩酊大醉，茫然无措。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The bewilderment seemed to grow and for a moment she saw his true face, the one he ordinarily kept so well hidden, and it was a face of desperate unhappiness, the face of an animal caught in a snare beyond its ability to decipher and render harmless. Then the muscles began to work, began to writhe under the skin, the mouth began to tremble infirmly, the Adam's apple began to rise and fall.</div>

<div class="line_en">She had seen him cry before, but never since he stopped drinking… and never in those days unless he was very drunk and pathetically remorseful. He was a tight man, drum-tight, and his loss of control frightened her all over again.</div>

His feet, clad in Hush Puppies, stumbled over the wreck of the radio and he almost fell into her arms, making her stagger back with his weight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他向她走过来，眼睛里噙满了泪水，头不由自主地摇晃着，好像在为摆脱这场感情风暴做徒劳的努力，他的胸脯剧烈地起伏着，伴随着不可阻遏的哽咽和抽泣。他趿着拖鞋的双脚绊在电台残骸上，他扑倒在她怀里，她一时承受不了他的体重，不禁向后打了几个趔趄。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他目送她走出去，愣了一会儿，然后将手里拿着的一张撒满碎玻璃碴子的吸墨纸丢进废纸篓，跟了上去，在门厅登记台赶上了她。他两手搭在她肩上，把她转过来面向自己。她仍然板着脸。">查看中文翻译</div>

He only sucked his thumb and stared with indifferent blankness out into the stairwell beyond both of them.</div>

<div class="line_en">He started up the stairs without waiting for her. She followed him, half- running, but he was taking the risers two at a time. She almost crashed into his back when he came to a dead stop on the first-floor landing. He was rooted there, looking up, his eyes wide.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰克往楼梯走去，没有等她。她小跑着跟了上去，他已经开始爬楼梯了。他突然在二楼楼梯平台停了下来，温迪差点撞上了他。他纹丝不动地钉在那里，望着上面，眼睛睁着大大的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was really only one question, and it was asked in a mental voice of utter coldness and pragmatism, the voice of her maternity, a cold and passionless voice once it was directed away from the closed circle of mother and child and out toward Jack. It was a voice that spoke of self-preservation only after son-preservation and its question was: (Exactly how dangerous is he?) He had denied doing it. He had been horrified at the bruises, at Danny's soft and implacable disconnection. If he had done it, a separate section of himself had been responsible. The fact that he had done it when he was asleep was-in a terrible, twisted way-encouraging. Wasn't it possible that he could be trusted to get them out of here? To get them down and away.

Her fingers, on his shoulder, had noticed that his T-shirt was damp, but they had not bothered reporting the information to her brain in more than a cursory way. If it had been reported, she might have remembered that Jack's hands, as he had hugged her in the office and sobbed against her neck, had been dry. It might have given her pause. But her mind was still on other things. The decision had to be made-to approach Jack or not?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她小声哼着，轻轻摇着，丹尼的头偎在她的乳房上。她的手指感觉到了他的T恤衫是湿的，但手指没有费事去把这个信息略微详细地报告给她的大脑。如果报告了，她也许会记起杰克的手是干的，因为他在办公室拥抱过她，还倚在她脖子上抽泣过。这也许会使她有所踌躇，但她的心思仍然停留在别的事情上。必须做出决定——找不找杰克帮忙？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Actually it was not much of a decision. There was nothing she could do alone, not even carry Danny down to the office and call for help on the CB radio. He had suffered a great shock. He ought to be taken out quickly before any permanent damage could be done. She refused to let herself believe that permanent damage might already have been done.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="实际上这算不上什么决定。她独自一人什么也干不了，甚至带丹尼到楼下办公室去用民用电台发出呼救信号她都做不到。他受了巨大的惊吓，在造成任何永久性伤害之前应该尽快把他送出去。她不相信永久性伤害已经造成了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And still she agonized over it, looking for another alternative. She did not want to put Danny back within Jack's reach. She was aware now that she had made one bad decision when she had gone against her feelings (and Danny's) and allowed the snow to close them in… for Jack's sake. Another bad decision when she had shelved the idea of divorce. Now she was nearly paralyzed by the idea that she might be making another mistake, one she would regret every minute of every day of the rest of her life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但她仍然为此十分苦恼，寻找着另一个替代办法。她不想把丹尼放到杰克够得着的地方去。她终于意识到，她违背她自己和丹尼的直觉而…为了杰克，同意上山来让大雪把他们隔离在这里的时候做出了一个很糟糕的决定；另一个错误决定是她搁置了离婚的念头。现在，想到自己可能犯另一个错误，一个她从今往后每时每刻都会追悔莫及的错误，她便感到全身瘫软。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At last she stood up with Danny in her arms, her legs trembling. There was no other way. She would have to assume that Jack awake was Jack sane, and that he would help her get Danny down to Sidewinder and Dr. Edmonds. And if Jack tried to do anything but help, God help him.</div>
