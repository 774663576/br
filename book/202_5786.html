<div class="line_en">Harry and Hermione felt that it was best not to stay anywhere too long, and Ron agreed, with the sole proviso that their next move took them within reach of a bacon sandwich. Hermione therefore removed the enchantments she had placed around the clearing, while Harry and Ron obliterated all the marks and impressions on the ground that might show they had camped there. Then they Disapparated to the outskirts of a small market town.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利和赫敏认为最好不要在一个地方待得太久，罗恩也同意，只是提出到了下一个宿营地必须能吃到咸肉三明治。于是赫敏解除了她在空地上设的防护魔法，哈利和罗恩消去了地上他们宿营过的痕迹，三人幻影移形到了一个小集镇。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Early next morning, before the other two were awake, Harry left the tent to search the woods around them for the oldest, most gnarled, and resilient-looking tree he could find. There in its shadow he buried Mad-Eye Moody's eye and marked the spot by gouging a small cross in the bark with his wand. It was not much, but Harry felt that Mad-Eye would have much preferred this to being stuck on Dolores Umbridge's door. Then he returned to the tent to wait for the others to wake, and discuss what they were going to do next.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天一大早，在另外两人醒来之前，哈利走出帐篷，在林子里找到了一棵最苍老虬曲、看上去最坚韧的大树，把疯眼汉穆迪的魔眼埋在树荫下，用魔杖在树皮上刻了个小十字作为记号。这不算什么，但哈利想疯眼汉会觉得这比安在乌姆里奇的门上好得多。他回到帐篷里，等两个伙伴醒来讨论下一步怎么办。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Once they had pitched the tent in the shelter of a small copse of trees and surrounded it with freshly cast defensive enchantments, Harry ventured out under the Invisibility Cloak to find sustenance. This, however, did not go as planned. He had barely entered the town when an unnatural chill, a descending mist, and a sudden darkening of the skies made him freeze where he stood.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他们在一小片幽僻的矮林子里搭好帐篷，又在周围设了新的防护魔法之后，哈利便披着隐形衣出去找吃的。但此行并不顺利，他刚进集镇，就感到了一阵不正常的寒意，弥漫的雾气和突然的天昏地暗使他僵立在那里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"But you can make a brilliant Patronus!" protested Ron, when Harry arrived back at the tent empty-handed, out of breath, and mouthing the single word, dementors.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但你可以召出那么棒的守护神啊！”当哈利空着手回到帐篷里，气喘吁吁地用口型说出“摄魂怪”时，罗恩不甘心地说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"So we still haven't got any food."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这么说我们还是没有吃的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Shut up, Ron," snapped Hermione. "Harry, what happened? Why do you think you couldn't make your Patronus? You managed perfectly yesterday!"</div>

<div class="line_en">Their expressions of consternation and disappointment made Harry feel ashamed. It had been a nightmarish experience, seeing the dementors gliding out of the mist in the distance and realizing, as the paralyzing cold choked his lungs and a distant screaming filled his ears, that he was not going to be able to protect himself. It had taken all Harry's willpower to uproot himself from the spot and run, leaving the eyeless dementors to glide amongst the Muggles who might not be able to see them, but would assuredly feel the despair they cast wherever they went.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们震惊和失望的表情让哈利感到羞耻。这是噩梦般的感受，眼看着摄魂怪从远处雾中飘出，令人麻木的寒气使他肺部窒息，远处的尖叫灌进他的耳朵，却意识到他无法保护自己。哈利用了全部的意志力才拔起腿来，逃出了那个地方，那些没有眼睛的摄魂怪还在麻瓜中间飘行，麻瓜或许看不到它们，但一定也会感觉到它们所到之处散发的绝望。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He sat low in one of Perkins's old armchairs, feeling more humiliated by the moment. He was afraid that something had gone wrong inside him.

<div class="line_cn" title="他低低地坐在珀金斯的旧扶手椅上，此刻感觉更加羞耻。他担心自己内心出了什么问题，昨天好像已是很久以前：今天他似乎又回到了十三岁，是惟一一个在霍格沃茨特快列车上昏倒的学生。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“怎么回事啊？”他对赫敏吼道，“我饿死了！我从差点失血而死到现在，只吃了几块毒蘑菇！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Harry," she said, crouching down in front of him and using the kind of voice he associated with visiting the very sick, "you don't think you've been possessed, do you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哈利，”她在他面前蹲下来，用令他联想想探望危重病人的语气说，“你没有被附身吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“很讨巧嘛。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She held out her hands, and Harry lifted the golden chain over his head. The moment it parted contact with Harry's skin he felt free and oddly light. He had not even realized that he was clammy or that there was a heavy weight pressing on his stomach until both sensations lifted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她伸出双手，哈利把金链子从脑袋上脱下来。那玩意儿一离开他的皮肤，哈利立刻感到了自由和出奇的轻松，这才意识到自己刚才已被冷汗黏湿，胃里像压着一块巨石。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Of course!" CRIed Hermione, clapping a hand to her forehead and startling both of them into silence. "Harry, give me the locket! Come on," she said impatiently, clicking her fingers at him when he did not react, "the Horcrux, Harry, you're still wearing it!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对了！”赫敏一拍额头，叫了起来，两人都惊讶地沉默了，“哈利，给我那个挂坠盒！快，”见他没有反应，她朝他打着响指，急躁地说，“那个魂器，哈利，你还戴着它呢！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh, all right, all right," said Hermione, and she placed it around her own neck and tucked it out of sight down the front of her shirt. "But we'll take turns wearing it, so nobody keeps it on too long."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，好吧，好吧，”赫敏说着，把它挂到自己的脖子上，塞进衬衫领子里，“但我们要轮流戴它，谁都不要戴得太久。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What? No!" he said defensively. "I remember everything we've done while I've been wearing it. I wouldn't know what I'd done if I'd been possessed, would I? Ginny told me there were times when she couldn't remember anything."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“什么？没有！”他辩白道，“我戴着它时做过的事情我都记得，如果被附身了，我是不会记得的，对不对？金妮告诉我说，有些时候她什么都不记得。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And, indeed, it was much easier to relax when they were comfortably well fed: The argument about the dementors was forgotten in laughter that night, and Harry felt cheerful, even hopeful, as he took the first of the three night watches.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="舒舒服服吃饱之后，确实容易放松。关于摄魂怪的争吵在笑声中被遗忘了。晚上分三班放哨，哈利值第一班时，心情是很愉快，甚至是很乐观的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This was their first encounter with the fact that a full stomach meant good spirits; an empty one, bickering and gloom. Harry was least surprised by this, because he had suffered periods of near starvation at the Dursleys'. Hermione bore up reasonably well on those nights when they managed to scavenge nothing but berries or stale biscuits, her temper perhaps a little shorter than usual and her silences rather dour. Ron, however, had always been used to three delicious meals a day, courtesy of his mother or of the Hogwarts house-elves, and hunger made him both unreasonable and irascible. Whenever lack of food coincided with Ron's turn to wear the Horcrux, he became downright unpleasant.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是他们第一次体会到饱肚子会带来好心情，而空肚子会引起争吵和沮丧。哈利对此最不意外，因为他在德思礼家多次尝过忍饥挨饿的滋味。在那些只找到桨果或陈饼干的夜晚，赫敏风度还不错，虽然脾气或许比平时急躁一些，沉默时脸色也阴沉一些。罗恩却是习惯于一日三餐都能享用他妈妈或霍格沃茨家养小精灵提供的可口饭菜，饥饿使他失去了理智，暴躁易怒。每当缺少吃的又赶上佩戴魂器时，他就变得简直令人讨厌了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"So where next?" was his constant refrain. He did not seem to have any ideas himself, but expected Harry and Hermione to come up with plans while he sat and brooded over the low food supplies. Accordingly Harry and Hermione spent fruitless hours trying to decide where they might find the other Horcruxes, and how to destroy the one they had already got, their conversations becoming increasingly repetitive as they had no new information.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“下面去哪儿？”成了他的口头禅，他自己似乎一点主意也没有，全指望哈利、赫敏拿出计划，而他只坐在那里为食物不足而闷闷不乐。哈利和赫敏长时间地合计去哪儿可能找到其他魂器，讨论如何摧毁已经找到的这一个，但毫无结果。他们的对话越来越单调，因为得不到新的信息。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yeah, let's go to Albania. Shouldn't take more than an afternoon to search an entire country," said Ron sarcastically.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊，去阿尔巴尼亚吧，搜索整个国家只要花一下午。”罗恩讽刺地说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As Dumbledore had told Harry that he believed Voldemort had hidden the Horcruxes in places important to him, they kept reciting, in a sort of dreary litany, those locations they knew that Voldemort had lived or visited. The orphanage where he had been born and raised; Hogwarts, where he had been educated; Borgin and Burkes, where he had worked after completing school; then Albania, where he had spent his years of exile: These formed the basis of their speculations.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I can't see him hiding anything at Borgin and Burkes," said Harry, who had made this point many times before, but said it again simply to break the nasty silence. "Borgin and Burke were experts at Dark objects, they would've recognized a Horcrux straightaway."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我看他不会在博金－博克藏什么东西。”哈利说，他已经多次表达过这一观点，但又说了一遍，只为打破那不愉快的沉默，“博金和博克都是黑魔法专家，他们一下就会发现魂器的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我们可以试试到地基里挖一挖？”赫敏热情不高地说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He wouldn't have hidden a Horcrux here," Harry said. He had known it all along: The orphanage had been the place Voldemort had been determined to escape; he would never have hidden a part of his soul there. Dumbledore had shown Harry that Voldemort sought grandeur or mystique in his hiding places; this dismal gray corner of London was as far removed as you could imagine from Hogwarts or the Ministry or a building like Gringotts, the Wizarding bank, with its golden doors and marble floors.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他不会把魂器藏在这里的。”哈利说。他早就知道：孤儿院是伏地魔决心要逃离的地方，他绝不会把自己灵魂的一部分藏在那儿。邓布利多曾提示哈利，伏地魔选择藏身之处时追求庄严或神秘的气氛。伦敦的这个阴郁灰暗的角落，与霍格沃茨、魔法部或是巫师银行古灵阁的金门和大理石地面，可以说有天壤之别。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Even without any new ideas, they continued to move through the countryside, pitching the tent in a different place each night for security. Every morning they made sure that they had removed all clues to their presence, then set off to find another lonely and secluded spot, traveling by Apparition to more woods, to the shadowy crevices of cliffs, to purple moors, gorse-covered mountainsides, and once a sheltered and pebbly cove. Every twelve hours or so they passed the Horcrux between them as though they were playing some perverse, slow-motion game of pass-the-parcel, where they dreaded the music stopping because the reward was twelve hours of increased fear and anxiety.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管没有新主意，他们仍然在野外流浪。为安全起见，他们每天晚上都在不同的地方宿营，早晨消去留下的所有痕迹，然后出发去寻找另一个偏僻隐蔽的地方，幻影显形到森林、幽暗的崖缝、紫色的沼地、开满金雀花的山坡，还有一次到了一个隐蔽的卵石小湾。他们轮流佩戴魂器，大约每十二小时一换，好像在玩一种邪恶的、慢动作的击鼓传花游戏，每个人都害怕鼓声停止，因为惩罚是十二个小时的更强烈的恐惧和焦虑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And Ron would turn away, making no effort to hide his disappointment. Harry knew that Ron was hoping to hear news of his family or of the rest of the Order of the Phoenix, but after all, he, Harry, was not a television aerial; he could only see what Voldemort was thinking at the time, not tune in to whatever took his fancy. Apparently Voldemort was dwelling endlessly on the unknown youth with the gleeful face, whose name and whereabouts, Harry felt sure, Voldemort knew no better than he did. As Harry's scar continued to burn and the merry, blond-haired boy swam tantalizingly in his memory, he learned to suppress any sign of pain or discomfort, for the other two showed nothing but impatience at the mention of the thief. He could not entirely blame them, when they were so desperate for a lead on the Horcruxes.</div>

<div class="line_en">As the days stretched into weeks, Harry began to suspect that Ron and Hermione were having conversations without, and about, him. Several times they stopped talking abruptly when Harry entered the tent, and twice he came accidentally upon them, huddled a little distance away, heads together and talking fast; both times they fell silent when they realized he was approaching them and hastened to appear busy collecting wood or water.</div>

<div class="line_en">Autumn rolled over the countryside as they moved through it: They were now pitching the tent on mulches of fallen leaves. Natural mists joined those cast by the dementors; wind and rain added to their troubles.

<div class="line_en">Harry could not help wondering whether they had only agreed to come on what now felt like a pointless and rambling journey because they thought he had some secret plan that they would learn in due course. Ron was making no effort to hide his bad mood, and Harry was starting to fear that Hermione too was disappointed by his poor leadership. In desperation he tried to think of further Horcrux locations, but the only one that continued to occur to him was Hogwarts, and as neither of the others thought this at all likely, he stopped suggesting it.</div>

<div class="line_en">There were several distinct splashes and then the slapping sounds of fish against flesh. Somebody grunted appreciatively. Harry pressed the Extendable Ear deeper into his own: Over the murmur of the river he could make out more voices, but they were not speaking English or any human language he had ever heard. It was a rough and unmelodious tongue, a string of rattling, guttural noises, and there seemed to be two speakers, one with a slightly lower, slower voice than the other.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几处泼剌剌的溅水声，接着是鱼撞到皮肤上的啪唧声。有人赞赏地嘟囔着。哈利把伸缩耳往自己耳朵里塞得更深一点，在潺潺的水声中他又听到了一些说话声，但说的不是英语，也不是他听过的任何人类语言。那是一种粗哑刺耳的说话声，一连串嘎嘎的喉音，听起来好像有两个人，一个声音稍微低一些、慢一些。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The voices became louder but no more intelligible as the group of men reached the bank. Harry estimated that their owners were fewer than twenty feet away, but the cascading river made it impossible to tell for sure.

<div class="line_en">Plunk, plunk, plunk. The rain was falling harder and heavier; it pattered on the leaf-strewn bank all around them and into the river chattering through the dark. Dread doused Harry's jubilation: Ron was saying exactly what he had suspected and feared him to be thinking.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="啪嗒，啪嗒，啪嗒：雨越来越急，越来越大。打在周围落叶覆盖的河岸上，打在黑暗中潺潺的河水上。恐惧浇灭了哈利的欢乐：罗恩说的正是哈利怀疑并害怕他会有的想法。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's not like I'm not having the time of my life here," said Ron, "you know, with my arm mangled and nothing to eat and freezing my backside off every night. I just hoped, you know, after we'd been running round a few weeks, we'd have achieved something."</div>
