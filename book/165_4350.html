<div class="line_en">Hibernation wasn't like regular sleep. A hibernator didn't feel the passage of time. Throughout the entire process, one could only feel time during the hour spent entering hibernation and the hour emerging from it. No matter how much time passed during hibernation, subjectively, the hibernator only felt that he or she had slept no more than two hours. Thus, waking up always involved a sharp break, a feeling that the self had passed through a door in time and emerged into a new world.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="冬眠与睡眠不同，感觉不到时间的流逝。在整个过程中，只有在进入冬眠和苏醒时的不到两个小时有时间感，不管冬眠了多么漫长的岁月，感觉只是睡了不到两个小时，所以苏醒时总是有一种切换感，感觉自己通过了一道时空门，一下子进入了另一个世界。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Cheng Xin found herself in a white spherical space. She saw that 艾 AA was floating nearby, dressed in the same skintight hibernation suit. Her hair was wet and her limbs were spread out powerlessly; clearly, she had just been awakened as well. As their eyes met, Cheng Xin wanted to speak, but the numbness caused by the cold had still not left her, and she couldn't make any noise. AA shook her head, meaning that she was in the same state and didn't know anything.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="程心现在身处的世界是一个白色的球形空间，她看到艾AA飘浮在附近，和她一样身穿冬眠时的紧身服，头发湿漉漉的，四肢无力地摊开，显然也是刚刚醒来。她们目光相遇时，程心想说话，但低温造成的麻痹还没有过去，她发不出声来。AA对她吃力地摇摇头，意思是：我和你一样，什么都不知道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Cheng Xin noticed that the space was filled with a golden light like the setting sun. The light came in through a circular window -- a porthole. Outside the porthole, Cheng Xin could see only blurred streaks and swirling lines. The lines were arranged into parallel bands of blue and yellow, revealing a world covered by raging storms and torrents, clearly the surface of Jupiter. Cheng Xin saw that the surface of Jupiter looked much brighter than she remembered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="程心发现这个空间中充满了夕照一般的黄色光，这光是从一处像气窗的圆形窗口透进来的。在窗外，程心看到迷离的流线状和旋涡状的气纹充满了视野，这些条纹呈平行的蓝黄相间的带状分布，显示出一个被年野的风暴和激流覆盖的世界。这显然是木星表面。程心现在看到的木星表面与半个世纪前看到的有明显不同，亮了许多。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She discovered another amazing fact as well: The place they were in stayed at rest relative to the combined space city, but Jupiter was slowly moving in the background. Based on the brightness of Jupiter, they were now on the side facing the Sun, and she could see the shadow of the combined space city against the gaseous surface of Jupiter. After a while, the Jovian terminator appeared, dividing Jupiter's day from night, and she saw the monstrous eye that was the Great Red Spot drifting into view. Everything confirmed the fact that both the place they were in and the combined space city were not in Jupiter's shadow and did not orbit the Sun in parallel with Jupiter; instead, they were Jupiter's satellites and revolved around the gas giant.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="程心还发现了一个惊人的事实：她们所在的地方与太空城组合体相对静止，但背景的木星表面却在缓缓移动！从木星表面的亮度看，现在显然处于向阳面，甚至可以看到阳光在木星的气态表而投下的太空城组合体的影子。又过了一会儿，木星的日夜交界线出现了，怪眼一样的大红斑也缓缓移入视野。这一切都证明。她们虽在的地方与太空城组合体并没有处于木星背阳阴影中，也没有与木星在太阳轨道上平行运行，两者现在都是木星的卫星，在围绕木星运行。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Strangely, the wide, raging cloud band in the middle reminded her of the Yellow River. She knew, of course, that an eddy in this "Yellow River" was big enough to contain the Earth. Against this background, Cheng Xin saw an object. The main body of the object was a long column whose sections were of different diameters. Three short cylinders were perpendicularly attached to the main column at different locations. The entire assembly slowly rotated around the axis of the column. Cheng Xin decided that she was looking at a combined space city formed from eight separate space cities docked together.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="很奇怪，中间那一条宽阔汹涌的云带，竟让她想到了黄河。她当然知道，这条“黄河中的一个旋涡可能容得下一个地球。在这个背景上，程心看到一个物体，主体是一根长长的圆柱，各段粗细不同，在圆柱的不同部位还附着有三个短柱体，它们联结为一个整体以圆往为轴心缓缓旋转着。程心确定这是一个太空城组合体，由八座太空城组合而成。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="AA又摇摇头，“不知道，好像在飞船上。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Where are we?" Cheng Xin asked. She was finally able to speak in a hoarse voice, but she still couldn't move her body.</div>

<div class="line_en">The voice came from an information window that had just popped up next to them. In the window was an old man with a head full of white hair. Cheng Xin recognized him as Cao Bin. Based on his age, she realized that she had leapt across another long stretch of years. Cao Bin told her that it was now May 19 of Year 67 of the Bunker Era. She realized that fifty-six more years had passed since her last brief awakening.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这声音来自她们旁边刚刚弹出的一个信息窗口，窗口中显示着一个白发苍苍的老人，程心一眼就认出了他是曹彬。看到他的老态，她意识到自己又跨越了一大段岁月。曹彬告诉她，现在是掩体纪元67年5月19日，她才知道自上次短暂的苏醒后，五十六年又过去了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She avoided life by staying outside of time, and she watched as others aged, seemingly in an instant. Her heart was filled with regret and guilt. She decided that no matter what happened from now on, this was her last hibernation.</div>

<div class="line_en">Cao Bin told them that they were on the latest ship to bear the Halo name. It had been constructed only three years ago. After the Halo City Incident, more than half a century earlier, he and Bi Yunfeng had both been convicted, though both had served short sentences and then been released. Bi Yunfeng had died more than ten years earlier, and Cao Bin brought along his well wishes for her and AA. Cheng Xin's eyes moistened.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="曹彬告诉她们，她们所在的飞船是“星环”号的最新一代型号，三年前才建造完成。他说在半个世纪前的星环城事件后，他和毕云峰都被判有罪，但都在服刑后不久即被释放。毕云峰已经在十多年前去世，曹彬带来了他临终前对她们的问候，这让程心的双眼湿润了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Life in the cities is once again like being in paradise. It's too bad that you won't get to see it, because there's no time." Cao Bin paused. Cheng Xin and AA exchanged uneasy glances. They realized that he had been so loquacious until now because he was trying to delay this moment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“城市中的生活又变得像天堂一样了，可惜你们不能去看，没有时间了。”曹彬说到这里突然停了下来。程心和AA交换了一个不安的眼神，她们现在知道他之前的滔滔不绝可能就是为了推迟这一时刻。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Cao Bin also told them that there were now fifty-two large space cities in the Jupiter cluster, most of which had been combined into bigger cities. What they could see was Jupiter Combination II. Since the advance warning system had been refined twenty years ago, all cities had decided to become Jovian satellites. Only after an alert was issued would the cities change orbit and go into hiding.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="曹彬告诉她们，现在木星群落的大型太空城已经增加到五十二座，大部分都形成了组合体，她们能看到的是木星二号组合体。由于太阳系防御系统的完善，所有的城市在二十年前都成为了木星的卫星，只有在出现打击警报后才会改变轨道躲进掩体区。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Cheng Xin's heart tensed. It wasn't because the attack had arrived -- humanity had been preparing for this moment for more than a century. Rather, she sensed that something was wrong. She and AA had been awakened by contract. It would have taken at least four to five hours for them to recover to this stage, which meant that the alert had been issued some time ago. But outside the porthole, Jupiter Combination II had not disassembled nor changed its orbit, but continued to drift as a Jovian satellite, as though nothing had happened. They turned to Cao Bin: The centenarian's expression was too placid, as though hiding utter despair.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="程心的心骤然紧缩，不是因为打击的降临，一个多世纪以来，人类世界已经为此做好了一切准备，但她却敏感地觉察到事情不对。她们按照约定被唤醒了，恢复到这种状态至少需要四五个小时，就是说警报发出已经有一段时间了。可窗外的木星组合体二号既没有紧急解体，也没有改变轨道，仍若无其事地作为木星的卫星运行着。再看看曹彬，这个一百多岁的老人表情也太平静了，似乎还隐含着绝望。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Was there an attack alert?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“打击警报出现了吗？”程心问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Cao Bin nodded. "Yes, there's been an alert. During the last half century, there were two false alarms, and each time, we almost awakened you. But this time it's real. Children -- I'm already one hundred and twelve years of age, so I think I can call you that -- the dark forest strike is finally here."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="曹彬点点头，“是的，警报出现了，在半个世纪中有过两次误报，都差点把你们唤醒、但这一次是真的。孩子们——我已经一百一十二岁了，可以这么叫你们了吧——孩子们，黑暗森林打击终于降临了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Cheng Xin saw a hall behind him that looked like a control center. Information windows filled almost every bit of space. The windows drifted around the hall, but new windows kept on popping open before them, only to be covered in turn by still newer windows -- like the flood after a burst dam. But the people in the hall seemed to be doing nothing. Half of them were in military uniforms, but they all either stood leaning against a desk or sat still. Everyone had dull eyes, and all had the same ominous calm expression that was on Cao Bin's face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="程心看到曹彬身后是一个控制中心之类的大厅，空间几乎被泛滥的信息窗口所淹没。那些窗口在大厅中到处飘浮，不断有新出现的窗口挤到前面，但很快又被后来的窗口遮盖，像溃堤后涌出的洪水一般。但大厅中的人们似乎什么也没做。那里的人有一半穿着军装，他们或者靠着办公桌站立，或者静坐着，所有人都目光呆滞，脸上呈现着与曹彬一样的不祥的平静。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This didn't look like a world hunkered down inside a bunker, certain it could survive the attack. It looked more like three centuries ago -- no, four centuries ago now -- when the Trisolar Crisis had first developed. Back then, at the offices of the PIA and the PDC, Cheng Xin had seen this kind of atmosphere and expression everywhere: despair against some superpowerful force in the universe, a kind of numbness and indifference that said We give up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这不像一个已经进入掩体、面对打击胸有成竹的世界，倒是很像三个多世纪前，不，已经是四个世纪前，三体危机刚出现时的状态。那时，在PLA和PDC各种机构的办公室里，程心到处都能见到这样的气氛和表情，显示着一种面对宇宙中超强力量的绝望，一种放弃一切的麻木和漠然。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Most of the people in the control center were quiet, but a few whispered to each other with somber faces. Cheng Xin saw a man sitting numbly. A cup had fallen over on the table in front of him, and a blue liquid spilled off the table onto his pants, but he ignored it. On the other side, in front of a large information window that seemed to show some complicated, evolving situation, a man in military uniform embraced a woman dressed as a civilian. The woman's face seemed wet…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大厅中的人们大部分沉默着，但也有少数人正脸色黯然地低声交谈着什么。程心看到一个呆坐的男人，桌上一只杯子倒了，蓝色的饮料从桌面一直流到裤子上，但他全然没有理会。在另一侧，在一个被永远置顶的显示着复杂趋势图的大面积信息窗口，前一名军人和一个平民女性拥抱在一起，那女人的脸上有隐隐的泪光……">查看中文翻译</div>
