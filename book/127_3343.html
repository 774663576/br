<div class="line_en">The winter was a wretched one. There were days on which Sara tramped through snow when she went on her errands; there were worse days when the snow melted and combined itself with mud to form slush; there were others when the fog was so thick that the lamps in the street were lighted all day and London looked as it had looked the afternoon, several years ago, when the cab had driven through the thoroughfares with Sara tucked up on its seat, leaning against her father's shoulder. On such days the windows of the house of the Large Family always looked delightfully cozy and alluring, and the study in which the Indian gentleman sat glowed with warmth and rich color. But the attic was dismal beyond words. There were no longer sunsets or sunrises to look at, and scarcely ever any stars, it seemed to Sara. The clouds hung low over the skylight and were either gray or mud-color, or dropping heavy rain. At four o'clock in the afternoon, even when there was no special fog, the daylight was at an end. If it was necessary to go to her attic for anything, Sara was obliged to light a candle. The women in the kitchen were depressed, and that made them more ill-tempered than ever. Becky was driven like a little slave.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'll tell you something warmer," shivered Sara. "Get your coverlet and wrap it round you, and I'll get mine, and we will huddle close together on the bed, and I'll tell you about the tropical forest where the Indian gentleman's monkey used to live. When I see him sitting on the table near the window and looking out into the street with that mournful expression, I always feel sure he is thinking about the tropical forest where he used to swing by his tail from coconut trees. I wonder who caught him, and if he left a family behind who had depended on him for coconuts."</div>

Tell me some more, please, miss -- tell me about the subt'ranean passage we've dug under the walls."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Sometimes I can and sometimes I can't," she said stoutly. "But when I CAN I'm all right. And what I believe is that we always could -- if we practiced enough. I've been practicing a good deal lately, and it's beginning to be easier than it used to be. When things are horrible -- just horrible -- I think as hard as ever I can of being a princess. I say to myself, `I am a princess, and I am a fairy one, and because I am a fairy nothing can hurt me or make me uncomfortable.' You don't know how it makes you forget" -- with a laugh.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“有时能，有时不能，”她断然地说。“但当我能做到时，我就挺好。而我相信我们总是能做到的——只要我们练习得足够多。近来我练习了好多次，开始觉得比过去容易做到了。当情况险恶时——真的险恶时——我就像从前那样苦思冥想我是位公主。我对自己说，‘我是位公主，是位仙女公主，并且因为我是位仙女，所以没有什么东西能伤害我或者使我困苦。’你不知道这样做了能怎样使你忘记不幸。”她笑了一声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For several days it had rained continuously; the streets were chilly and sloppy and full of dreary, cold mist; there was mud everywhere -- sticky London mud -- and over everything the pall of drizzle and fog. Of course there were several long and tiresome errands to be done -- there always were on days like this -- and Sara was sent out again and again, until her shabby clothes were damp through. The absurd old feathers on her forlorn hat were more draggled and absurd than ever, and her downtrodden shoes were so wet that they could not hold any more water. Added to this, she had been deprived of her dinner, because Miss Minchin had chosen to punish her. She was so cold and hungry and tired that her face began to have a pinched look, and now and then some kind-hearted person passing her in the street glanced at her with sudden sympathy. But she did not know that. She hurried on, trying to make her mind think of something else. It was really very necessary. Her way of doing it was to "pretend" and "suppose" with all the strength that was left in her. But really this time it was harder than she had ever found it, and once or twice she thought it almost made her more cold and hungry instead of less so. But she persevered obstinately, and as the muddy water squelched through her broken shoes and the wind seemed trying to drag her thin jacket from her, she talked to herself as she walked, though she did not speak aloud or even move her lips.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="已经连下了几天雨，街上又寒冷又泥泞，充满了凄凉的寒雾，到处是泥浆——粘糊糊的伦敦泥浆——蒙蒙细雨和雾笼罩着一切。当然啦，有几件费时费力的差事得去做——在这种日子里总是这样的——萨拉一次次地被差遣出去，直到她的破衣服都湿透了。那顶破帽上可笑的旧羽毛泡了水后就更肮脏可笑了，那双踏倒了后跟的鞋已湿得不能再湿了。这还不算，还不准她吃晚饭，因为铭钦女士决意要惩罚她。她又冷又饿又累，脸庞看上去开始带着萎缩的样子。街上不时有些好心人走过她的身边，会怀着同情突然对她倏地望上一眼。但她并不知道，只顾匆匆地朝前走，竭力使自己的头脑去想一些别的事。这确实十分必要。她这样做的方法就是用尽身上的全部力量去“假装”，去“假定”。但这回可确实比以前更难。有那么一两次，她觉得这样做了几乎使她的饥寒之感有增无减。但她顽强地坚持着，泥水在她的破鞋中咯吱作响，风好像要从她身上把薄薄的外衣卷走，她边走边自言自语，虽然没有大声说，甚至连嘴唇都没动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She had many opportunities of making her mind think of something else, and many opportunities of proving to herself whether or not she was a princess.

<div class="line_en">It certainly was an odd thing that happened to Sara. She had to cross the street just when she was saying this to herself The mud was dreadful -- she almost had to wade. She picked her way as carefully as she could, but she could not save herself much; only, in picking her way, she had to look down at her feet and the mud, and in looking down -- just as she reached the pavement -- she saw something shining in the gutter. It was actually a piece of silver -- a tiny piece trodden upon by many feet, but still with spirit enough left to shine a little. Not quite a sixpence, but the next thing to it -- a fourpenny piece.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="萨拉遭遇到的确实是桩怪事。正当她对自己说这些话时，她必须横穿过街道。泥泞实在可怕——她几乎不得不躺着泥浆过去。她尽量小心地挑路走，但这也帮不了她什么忙，但在挑略走吋，她必须向下望着双脚和泥浆，而在向下望时——就在刚踏上人行道时——她看到了有什么东西在街沟里闪着亮。确实是一枚银币——一枚小银币，已被许多脚践踏过，可仍然留下些灵气足以闪出一点儿光。它不是六便士的，而是比它小一档的——是个四便士的银币。">查看中文翻译</div>

SUPPOSE if I did, I should go into the shop and buy six of the hottest buns and eat them all without stopping."</div>

<div class="line_en">It was dark when she reached the square where the Select Seminary was situated. The lights in the houses were all lighted. The blinds were not yet drawn in the windows of the room where she nearly always caught glimpses of members of the Large Family. Frequently at this hour she could see the gentleman she called Mr. Montmorency sitting in a big chair, with a small swarm round him, talking, laughing, perching on the arms of his seat or on his knees or leaning against them. This evening the swarm was about him, but he was not seated. On the contrary, there was a good deal of excitement going on. It was evident that a journey was to be taken, and it was Mr. Montmorency who was to take it. A brougham stood before the door, and a big portmanteau had been strapped upon it. The children were dancing about, chattering and hanging on to their father. The pretty rosy mother was standing near him, talking as if she was asking final questions. Sara paused a moment to see the little ones lifted up and kissed and the bigger ones bent over and kissed also.</div>
