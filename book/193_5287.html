<div class="line_en">Cardinal Mortati was sweating now in his black robe. Not only was the Sistine Chapel starting to feel like a sauna, but conclave was scheduled to begin in twenty minutes, and there was still no word on the four missing cardinals. In their absence, the initial whispers of confusion among the other cardinals had turned to outspoken anxiety.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="穿著黑色袍子的莫塔提枢机主教现在流汗了。不光是因为西斯汀礼拜堂开始让人感觉像三温暖，也是因为闭门会议再过二十分钟就要开始，但那四名失踪的枢机主教却毫无音讯。对于他们的缺席，其他枢机主教原先只是困惑地交头接耳，现在已经转变为坦率直言的焦虑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mortati could not imagine where the truant men could be. With the camerlegno perhaps? He knew the camerlegno had held the traditional private tea for the four preferiti earlier that afternoon, but that had been hours ago. Were they ill? Something they ate? Mortati doubted it. Even on the verge of death the preferiti would be here. It was once in a lifetime, usually never, that a cardinal had the chance to be elected Supreme Pontiff, and by Vatican Law the cardinal had to be inside the Sistine Chapel when the vote took place. Otherwise, he was ineligible.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莫塔提无法想像这四个人会跑到哪裡去。或许是跟总司库在一起？他知道今天下午稍早，总司库曾依照传统邀四位候选人私下茶叙，但那已经是好几个小时前了。他们会是生病了吗？因为吃了什么东西？莫塔提不太相信。就算是病得快死了，四位候选人也一定会到场的。一个枢机主教能被选为最高司祭，是一生只有一次的机会，通常还连这一次都没有，而且按照梵蒂冈的法律，投票时枢机主教必须在西斯汀礼拜堂内，否则就失去被选举资格。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Although there were four preferiti, few cardinals had any doubt who the next Pope would be. The past fifteen days had seen a blizzard of faxes and phone calls discussing potential candidates. As was the custom, four names had been chosen as preferiti, each of them fulfilling the unspoken requisites for becoming Pope:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然有四个候选人，但大部分人对于下一任教宗会是谁都已毫无疑问。过去十五天有大量的传真和电话讨论适当人选。根据传统，会有四个人被选为候选人，每个人都符合在默契上成为教宗的必要条件：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Cardinals often joked that being appointed The Great Elector was the cruelest honor in Christendom. The appointment made one ineligible as a candidate during the election, and it also required one spend many days prior to conclave poring over the pages of the Universi Dominici Gregis reviewing the subtleties of conclave's arcane rituals to ensure the election was properly administered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="枢机主教间常常开玩笑说，被指定为大选举官是基督宗教界最残酷的荣誉。这个职位会让一个枢机主教丧失了成为候选人的资格，而且在闭门会议之前得花很多天熟读《天主全体羊群》宗座宪章，复习闭门会议中种种神祕仪式的细节，以确保选举能够照章进行。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mortati was particularly unnerved by the missing cardinals because the task of supervising this conclave had fallen to him. A week ago, the College of Cardinals had unanimously chosen Mortati for the office known as The Great Elector -- the conclave's internal master of ceremonies. Even though the camerlegno was the church's ranking official, the camerlegno was only a priest and had little familiarity with the complex election process, so one cardinal was selected to oversee the ceremony from within the Sistine Chapel.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mortati, many believed, could have been Pope in his younger days had he not been so broad-minded. When it came to pursuing the papacy, there was a Holy Trinity-Conservative. Conservative. Conservative.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="很多人相信，要不是心胸过于宽大，早些年莫塔提是有可能成为教宗的。想要成为教宗有个「三位一体」定律──保守，保守，保守。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mortati had always found it pleasantly ironic that the late Pope, God rest his soul, had revealed himself as surprisingly liberal once he had taken office. Perhaps sensing the modern world progressing away from the church, the Pope had made overtures, softening the church's position on the sciences, even donating money to selective scientific causes. Sadly, it had been political suicide. Conservative Catholics declared the Pope "senile," while scientific purists accused him of trying to spread the church's influence where it did not belong.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莫塔提总觉得，已故教宗──愿他的灵魂安息──上任后便展现出令人意外的自由派作风，虽然讽刺，但令人开心。或许是感觉到现代社会已经和教会渐行渐远，这位教宗主动表示要放鬆教会在科学方面的立场，甚至捐款赞助某些科学研究。可悲的是，这成了政治自杀之举。保守的天主教徒宣称教宗已经「老糊涂」；而科学纯粹论者则指控他是想捞过界，扩展教会势力。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mortati held no grudge, though. He knew he was the logical choice. Not only was he the senior cardinal, but he had also been a confidant of the late Pope, a fact that elevated his esteem. Although Mortati was technically still within the legal age window for election, he was getting a bit old to be a serious candidate. At seventy-nine years old he had crossed the unspoken threshold beyond which the college no longer trusted one's health to withstand the rigorous schedule of the papacy. A Pope usually worked fourteen-hour days, seven days a week, and died of exhaustion in an average of 6.3 years. The inside joke was that accepting the papacy was a cardinal's "fastest route to heaven."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但莫塔提并没有不情愿，他知道自己是合理人选。不光因为他是资深的枢机主教，同时他也是已故教宗的至交，因而使他备受敬重。虽然莫塔提的年龄依法仍有被选举资格，但毕竟是有点太老，不会被认真考虑。现年七十九岁的他，已经超过了一条不成文的界限，枢机团无法再信赖这么一个老人的健康能禁得起教宗职位的严酷作息安排。身为教宗，通常每天要工作十四个小时，全年无休，而且在任平均六点三年就会因过于劳累而去世。有个内部笑话就说，接受教宗职位是一个枢机主教「通往天堂最快的路」。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Throughout his tenure, the camerlegno's steadfast devotion had become legendary. Many attributed it to the miraculous event in his childhood… an event that would have left a permanent impression on any man's heart. The miracle and wonder of it, Mortati thought, often wishing his own childhood had presented an event that fostered that kind of doubtless faith.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在任期内，总司库坚定不摇的虔诚奉献已经广为人知。许多人归因于他童年时代的那桩奇蹟事件……任何人碰上那样的事情，都会在心中留下永难磨灭的印象。不可思议的奇蹟，莫塔提心想，真希望小时候也碰到过让自己产生如此坚定信仰的事情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One of the cardinals was tapping him nervously on the shoulder. "You know where they are, don't you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有位枢机主教紧张兮兮地拍他肩膀。「你知道他们在哪裡，对吧？」">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"So where are they?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「他们人呢？」">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mortati tried not to show too much concern. "Perhaps still with the camerlegno."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莫塔提尽量不要表现得太过担心。「或许还跟总司库在一起吧。」">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"At this hour? That would be highly unorthodox!" The cardinal frowned mistrustingly. "Perhaps the camerlegno lost track of time?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「这个时间？那也未免太荒唐了！」那名枢机主教疑惑地皱起眉头。「或许总司库忘了时间？」">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mortati sincerely doubted it, but he said nothing. He was well aware that most cardinals did not much care for the camerlegno, feeling he was too young to serve the Pope so closely. Mortati suspected much of the cardinals" dislike was jealousy, and Mortati actually admired the young man, secretly applauding the late Pope's selection for chamberlain. Mortati saw only conviction when he looked in the camerlegno's eyes, and unlike many of the cardinals, the camerlegno put church and faith before petty politics. He was truly a man of God.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莫塔提实在不认为会是如此，但他什么也没说。他很清楚大部分枢机主教根本不把总司库当回事，觉得他太年轻，没资格当教宗的贴身助理。莫塔提怀疑很多枢机主教不喜欢总司库是出于嫉妒，而莫塔提自己倒是很欣赏这位年轻人，对已故教宗所挑的总司库人选暗自叫好。从总司库的双眼裡，莫塔提只看到一股坚定的信念；而且不同于许多枢机主教，总司库重视教会和信仰胜于琐碎的政治手腕。他确实是属于天主的人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Unfortunately for the church, Mortati knew, the camerlegno would never become Pope in his elder years. Attaining the papacy required a certain amount of political ambition, something the young camerlegno apparently lacked; he had refused his Pope's offers for higher clerical stations many times, saying he preferred to serve the church as a simple man.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但莫塔提知道，对教会来说，不幸的是，总司库未来也不可能成为教宗。要接掌教宗职位，就必须具备某种程度的政治野心，但这显然是年轻的总司库所缺乏的；他屡次拒绝教宗给予他更高的职位，说他比较喜欢以单纯的身分服事教会。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What next?" The cardinal tapped Mortati, waiting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「那接下来呢？」那个枢机主教又拍拍莫塔提，等著他回答。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mortati stood a moment, dabbing his temples and trying to clear his mind. Indeed, what shall we do? He gazed past the altar up to Michelangelo's renowned fresco, "The Last Judgment." The painting did nothing to soothe his anxiety. It was a horrifying, fifty-foot-tall depiction of Jesus Christ separating mankind into the righteous and sinners, casting the sinners into hell. There was flayed flesh, burning bodies, and even one of Michelangelo's rivals sitting in hell wearing ass's ears. Guy de Maupassant had once written that the painting looked like something painted for a carnival wrestling booth by an ignorant coal heaver.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莫塔提站在那裡一会儿，擦了擦太阳穴的汗，努力想理清思绪。的确，我们该怎么办？他的眼光掠过祭坛，往上看著米开朗基罗著名的溼壁画〈最后的审判〉。那幅画作丝毫不能抚平他的焦虑。那是一幅五十迟高的作品，令人惊骇地描绘出耶稣基督将人类分为义人与罪人，并将罪人掷入地狱。有人被剥皮，有人被焚烧，甚至还有个米开朗基罗的死对头被画上驴耳坐在地狱裡。法国小说家莫泊桑曾写道，这幅画看起来就像是一个无知运煤工替流动游艺团的摔角场所画的布幕。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Looking entirely unsatisfied with Mortati's response, the cardinal shrunk back into the shadows.</div>
