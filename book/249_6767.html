<div class="line_en">However, these thinkings and projects of their were private, and did not show on the surface, and therefore threw no shadow upon the celebration. What showed upon the surface was a serene and lofty contentment and a dignity of carriage and gravity of deportment which compelled the admiration and likewise the wonder of the company. All noticed it and all commented upon it, but none was able to divine the secret of it. It was a marvel and a mystery. Three several persons remarked, without suspecting what clever shots they were making:</div>

<div class="line_en">The celebration went off well. The friends were all present, both the young and the old. Among the young were Flossie and Gracie Peanut and their brother Adelbert, who was a rising young journeyman tinner, also Hosannah Dilkins, Jr., journeyman plasterer, just out of his apprenticeship. For many months Adelbert and Hosannah had been showing interest in Gwendolen and Clytemnestra Foster, and the parents of the girls had noticed this with private satisfaction. But they suddenly realized now that that feeling had passed. They recognized that the changed financial conditions had raised up a social bar between their daughters and the young mechanics. The daughters could now look higher -- and must. Yes, must. They need marry nothing below the grade of lawyer or merchant; poppa and momma would take care of this; there must be no m'esalliances.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="庆祝会开得很顺利。朋友们老少咸集，济济一堂。年轻人有弗萝酋·皮纳特、格蕾丝·皮纳特以及她们的哥哥阿得尔伯特·皮纳特，他是一个满了师的年轻补锅匠，生意正红火。还有小霍萨纳·迪尔金斯，他是一个刚刚满师的泥瓦匠。阿得尔伯特和霍萨纳已经对克莱藤内斯特拉和格雯德伦·福斯特献了好几个月的殷勤，两个女孩的父母察觉以后，心中暗喜。现在他们突然发觉喜不起来了。他们意识到经济状况的改变已经在他们的女儿和两个小工匠之间筑起了一道社会地位的屏障。两个女儿如今可以往高处走了——一定要往高处走。不错，一定要往高处走。她们不必嫁给级别比律师或者商人低的男人了；老爸和老妈操着心呢，决不能让她们下嫁。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">No, she hadn't. They must look the market over -- which they did. To start with, they considered and discussed Brandish, rising young lawyer, and Fulton, rising young dentist. Sally must invite them to dinner. But not right away; there was no hurry, Aleck said. Keep an eye on the pair, and wait; nothing would be lost by going slowly in so important a matter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没有，她还没有选好。他们必须在市场上巡视一遍——他们就这么办了。他们首先把两个人提上了议事日程，他们是正在崛起的年轻律师布雷迪什和年轻牙医福尔顿。萨利一定要请他们来吃饭。然而不是马上就请；艾莱柯说，这事不急。留意这两个小伙子，等等看；如此重要的大事，要慢慢来才不会有闪失。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Most mothers would have taken hold of the matrimonial matter in the old regulation way; they would have given the girls a talking to, of a solemn sort and untactful -- a lecture calculated to defeat its own purpose, by producing tears and secret rebellion; and the said mothers would have further damaged the business by requesting the young mechanics to discontinue their attentions. But this mother was different. She was practical. She said nothing to any of the young people concerned, nor to any one else except Sally. He listened to her and understood; understood and admired. He said:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="多数母亲都会按照老规矩包办儿女的婚姻大事，她们会向女儿训话，讲一通莫测高深却又不着边际的大道理——这种训活往往事与愿违，只会把女儿训得泪水涟涟，引起她们内心的反感；如果这些母亲还要教训那些小工匠不要再打女儿的主意，就会把事情弄得更糟。然而，这位母亲却与众不同。她很务实。她既没有教训那两个年轻人，也没有对其他人提及此事，只告诉了萨利一个人。萨利听完了表示理解，不光理解，还赞不绝口。他说：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I get the idea. Instead of finding fault with the samples on view, thus hurting feelings and obstructing trade without occasion, you merely offer a higher class of goods for the money, and leave nature to take her course. It's wisdom, Aleck, solid wisdom, and sound as a nut. Who's your fish? Have you nominated him yet?"</div>

<div class="line_en">It turned out that this was wisdom, too; for inside of three weeks Aleck made a wonderful strike which swelled her imaginary hundred thousand to four hundred thousand of the same quality. She and Sally were in the clouds that evening. For the first time they introduced champagne at dinner. Not real champagne, but plenty real enough for the amount of imagination expended on it. It was Sally that did it, and Aleck weakly submitted. At bottom both were troubled and ashamed, for he was a high-up Son of Temperance, and at funerals wore an apron which no dog could look upon and retain his reason and his opinion; and she was a W. C. T. U., with all that that implies of boiler-iron virtue and unendurable holiness. But there is was; the pride of riches was beginning its disintegrating work. They had lived to prove, once more, a sad truth which had been proven many times before in the world: that whereas principle is a great and noble protection against showy and degrading vanities and vices, poverty is worth six of it. More than four hundred thousand dollars to the good. They took up the matrimonial matter again. Neither the dentist nor the lawyer was mentioned; there was no occasion, they were out of the running. Disqualified. They discussed the son of the pork-packer and the son of the village banker. But finally, as in the previous case, they concluded to wait and think, and go cautiously and sure.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="事实证明这一次也很有先见之明；因为在三个星期之内，艾莱柯大发利市，她想像中的那十万块钱又变成了足色足两的四十万块。那天晚上，他们就如腾云驾雾一般。吃晚饭的时候，他们破天荒地上了香按。也不是真有香按，而是运用了充分的想像力弄假成真了。这是萨利提议的，艾莱柯心一软就顺从了。两个人心底里都惴惴不安，羞愧难当，因为萨利是戒酒会的积极分子，参加葬礼时，总是系着一条围裙，连狗都不敢多瞧他一眼。他立场坚定，。洛守自己的主张。艾莱柯是基督教妇女戒酒会的会员，该会会员的坚定意志和嫉恶如仇的神圣信念她应有尽有。然而时过境迁，炫耀财富的心理开始挖墙角了。他们的生活再次证明了一条可悲的真理，这条真理已经在人世间反复证明过：尽管信念是抵御浮华堕落伤风败德的强大而崇高的力量，但是它的力量远不及贫穷。何况拥有了四十万块钱的财富呢！他们重新审议女儿的婚事。这一次牙医和律师已经名落孙山；他们的机遇已经丧失，退出了候选人之列，不够格了。他们讨论了猪肉批发商的儿子和镇上银行老板的儿子。可是和以往一样，他们最终的结论仍然是：再等等，再考虑考虑，走一步，看一步，力求万无一失。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Luck came their way again. Aleck, ever watchful saw a great and risky chance, and took a daring flyer. A time of trembling, of doubt, of awful uneasiness followed, for non-success meant absolute ruin and nothing short of it. Then came the result, and Aleck, faint with joy, could hardly control her voice when she said:</div>
