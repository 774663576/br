<div class="line_en">It's tempting, then, to use the 10,000-year horizon as a boundary between two major eras of human existence: a hunter-gatherer era, in which we did most of our biological evolving and which may still be glimpsed in extant hunter-gatherers, and the era of civilization thereafter. That is the dividing line that figures in theories of the ecological niche to which humans are biologically adapted, which evolutionary psychologists call "the environment of evolutionary adaptedness." But that is not the cut that is most relevant to the Leviathan hypothesis.</div>

<div class="line_en">The species we belong to, "anatomically modern Homo sapiens," is said to be 200,000 years old. But "behaviorally modern" humans, with art, ritual, clothing, complex tools, and the ability to live in different ecosystems, probably evolved closer to 75,000 years ago in Africa before setting out to people the rest of the world. When the species emerged, people lived in small, nomadic, egalitarian bands of kinsmen, subsisted by hunting and gathering, and had no written language or government. Today the vast majority of humans are settled in stratified societies numbering in the millions, eat foods cultivated by agriculture, and are governed by states. The transition, sometimes called the Neolithic (new stone age) Revolution, began around 10,000 years ago with the emergence of agriculture in the Fertile Crescent, China, India, West Africa, Mesoamerica, and the Andes.</div>

<div class="line_en">For one thing, the 10,000-year milestone applies only to the first societies that farmed. Agriculture developed in other parts of the world later and spread outward from those cradles only gradually. Ireland, for example, was not lapped by the wave of farming that emanated from the Near East until around 6,000 years ago. Many parts of the Americas, Australia, Asia, and Africa were populated by hunter-gatherers until a few centuries ago, and of course a few still are.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="首先，1万年的界限仅仅适用于第一个农耕社会。在世界其他地方，农业是从那些摇篮地区逐渐地传播出来的。比如，近东的农耕浪潮一直要到6000年前才波及爱尔兰。美洲、大洋洲、亚洲和非洲的许多地区直到几百年前还都是狩猎—采集者的家园，当然，有少数地方至今仍然如此。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Also, societies cannot be dichotomized into hunter-gatherer bands and agricultural civilizations. The nonstate peoples we are most familiar with are the hunters and gatherers living in small bands like the! Kung San of the Kalahari Desert and the Inuit of the Arctic. But these people have survived as hunter-gatherers only because they inhabit remote parts of the globe that no one else wants. As such they are not a representative sample of our anarchic ancestors, who may have enjoyed flusher environments. Until recently other foragers parked themselves in valleys and rivers that were teeming with fish and game and that supported a more affluent, complex, and sedentary lifestyle. The Indians of the Pacific Northwest, known for their totem poles and potlatches, are a familiar example. Also beyond the reach of states are hunter-horticulturalists, such as peoples in Amazonia and New Guinea who supplement their hunting and gathering by slashing and burning patches of forest and growing bananas or sweet potatoes in small gardens. Their lives are not as austere as those of pure hunter-gatherers, but they are far closer to them than they are to sedentary, full-time farmers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而且，狩猎—采集群体和农业文明是格格不入的两种社会形态。我们最熟知的非国家形态的狩猎—采集群体是喀拉哈里沙漠里的布须曼人（！Kung San），也称昆申人或桑人，以及北极圈内的因纽特人。但是，他们之所以能够以狩猎—采集的方式生存，完全是因为他们居住在没有其他人愿意涉足的地球极地。所以，他们不能代表我们的无政府社会祖先。我们的先人很可能享受着丰腴肥美的环境。直到不久之前，还有一些觅食者徜徉在山谷中、河流畔，那里丰富的鱼类和禽兽，让他们能够维持富足和复杂的定居生活方式。太平洋西北海岸的美洲印第安人就是人们熟悉的样板，他们的图腾柱和炫财冬节都非常出名。此外，还有一些人生活在亚马孙和新几内亚这些国家鞭长莫及的地带。他们是猎人兼栽种者，在狩猎和采集之外，他们刀耕火种，在森林中的小片空地上开辟菜园，种植香蕉或红薯。他们的生活虽然不像单纯的狩猎—采集者那样严峻艰苦，但也远远没有完全定居的农民那样舒适。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It took around five thousand years after the origin of agriculture for true states to appear on the scene. That happened when the more powerful chiefdoms used their armed retinues to bring other chiefdoms and tribes under their control, further centralizing their power and supporting niches for specialized classes of artisans and soldiers. The emerging states built strongholds, cities, and other defensible settlements, and they developed writing systems that allowed them to keep records, exact taxes and tributes from their subjects, and codify laws to keep them in line. Petty states with designs on their neighbors' assets sometimes forced them to become states in defense, and bigger states often swallowed smaller states.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在农耕文明历时5000年之后，才出现了第一个真正意义上的国家。开始是实力比较雄厚的酋长率领武装扈从，征服了其他酋邦和部落，进一步集中权力，并开始供养专业化的艺术家和士兵集团。新兴的国家开始修建堡垒、城市和其他防御设施。他们也开始发明书写文字，记录并明确属民上缴的税收和贡品，并编纂法典约束人民。有些国家垂涎邻邦的产业，这些国家不得不奋起自卫，结局往往是大国吞并小国。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When the first farmers settled down to grow grains and legumes and keep domesticated animals, their numbers exploded and they began to divide their labors, so that some of them lived off the food grown by others. But they didn't develop complex states and governments right away. They first coalesced into tribes connected by kinship and culture, and the tribes sometimes merged into chiefdoms, which had a centralized leader and a permanent entourage supporting him. Some of the tribes took up pastoralism, wandering with their livestock and trading animal products with sedentary farmers. The Israelites of the Hebrew Bible were tribal pastoralists who developed into chiefdoms around the time of the judges.</div>

<div class="line_en">For all these reasons, it makes no sense to test for historical changes in violence by plotting deaths against a time line from the calendar. If we discover that violence has declined in a given people, it is because their mode of social organization has changed, not because the historical clock has struck a certain hour, and that change can happen at different times, if it happens at all. Nor should we expect a smooth reduction in violence along the continuum from simple, nomadic hunter-gatherers to complex, sedentary hunter-gatherers to farming tribes and chiefdoms to petty states to large states. The major transition we should expect is at the appearance of the first form of social organization that shows signs of design for reducing violence within its borders. That would be the centralized state, the Leviathan.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们可以在日历上做一条死亡数量时间线，但对于检测暴力的历史演变，这根线毫无意义。如果我们发现某个人群中的暴力开始下降，那是因为他们的社会组织形态发生了变化，而不是历史时钟的指针走到了某个钟点。如果这个变化要发生，它可能发生在不同的时间。我们也不应该期待暴力是沿着从简单的狩猎—采集游牧社会，到复杂的狩猎—采集定居社会，到农耕部落和酋长制，到小国家，再到大国家这样一条直线平滑地下降的。我们可以期待的主要变迁，是第一个带来内部暴力下降的社会组织形式的出现，即中央集权的国家——利维坦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Anthropologists have proposed many subtypes and intermediate cases among these kinds of societies, and have noted that there is no cultural escalator that inevitably turns simpler societies into more complex ones. Tribes and chiefdoms can maintain their ways indefinitely, such as the Montenegrin tribes in Europe that lasted into the 20th century. And when a state breaks down, it can be taken over by tribes, as in the Greek dark ages (which followed the collapse of the Mycenaean civilization and in which the Homeric epics were set) and the European dark ages (which came after the fall of the Roman Empire). Even today, many parts of failed states, such as Somalia, Sudan, Afghanistan, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, are essentially chiefdoms; we call the chiefs warlords.</div>

<div class="line_en">The topic of violence in nonstate societies has a long and politicized history. For centuries it was conventional wisdom that native peoples were ferocious barbarians. The Declaration of Independence, for instance, complained that the king of England "endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="关于非国家形态社会的暴力，这是一个早已高度政治化的话题。在几百年间，一般人都认为土著人非常残忍。比如，美国《独立宣言》控诉说，英王“竭力挑唆残酷无情的印第安蛮族来对付我们边疆的居民，而众所周知，印第安人作战的准则是不分男女老幼、是非曲直，格杀勿论”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It's not that any early state was (as Hobbes theorized) a commonwealth vested with power by a social contract that had been negotiated by its citizens. Early states were more like protection rackets, in which powerful Mafiosi extorted resources from the locals and offered them safety from hostile neighbors and from each other. Any ensuing reduction in violence benefited the overlords as much as the protectees. Just as a farmer tries to prevent his animals from killing one another, so a ruler will try to keep his subjects from cycles of raiding and feuding that just shuffle resources or settle scores among them but from his point of view are a dead loss.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="早期的国家并不都是（比如霍布斯理论总结的）公民的共同体，其所拥有的权力来自公民协议产生的社会契约。早期的国家更像是勒索保护费的黑帮组织，蛮横的头领从本地人手里收取钱物，然后保护他们免受外人的欺侮，同时防止他们彼此之间争斗。首领和受他保护的人一样，受益于暴力的下降。就像一个农民要防止他饲养的动物彼此伤害一样，一个统治者也会尽力阻止他的属民卷入无休止的掠夺和对抗。对百姓来说，这些冲突不过是欠债还钱、报仇雪恨；但是对统治者而言，这是纯粹的净亏损。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Today the passage seems archaic, indeed offensive. Dictionaries warn against using the word savage (related to sylvan, "of the forest") to refer to native peoples, and our awareness of the genocides of Native Americans perpetrated by European colonists makes the signatories seem like a black pot in a glass house casting the first stone. A modern concern with the dignity and rights of all peoples inhibits us from speaking too frankly about rates of violence in preliterate peoples, and the "anthropologists of peace" have worked to give them a Rousseauian image makeover. Margaret Mead, for example, described the Chambri of New Guinea as a sex-reversed culture because the men were adorned with makeup and curls, omitting the fact that they had to earn the right to these supposedly effeminate decorations by killing a member of an enemy tribe. Anthropologists who did not get with the program found themselves barred from the territories in which they had worked, denounced in manifestoes by their professional societies, slapped with libel lawsuits, and even accused of genocide.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在今天来看，这段话的措辞太落后，也太冒犯了。字典已经开始警告说，不应使用“蛮族”（savage源于sylvan，意思是“森林中的”）来称指原住民。我们已经认识到欧洲殖民者对美洲原住民施行的种族灭绝，因此，《独立宣言》的签署者们看起来就像一口黑锅，自己满身污渍，偏偏要跳起来数落别人不干净。尊重他人的尊严和权利这种现代观念，让我们无法对史前人类的暴力程度做坦白的讨论，此外，“和平派人类学家们”还要为古人涂抹上一层卢梭主义彩妆。比如，玛格丽特·米德（Margaret Mead）将新几内亚的坎布里人（Chambri of New Guinea）描绘成为一种逆性别文化，她只看到那里的男性涂脂抹粉、弄卷毛发，而完全无视这些男子是在杀死敌对部落的成员之后，才有资格给自己装扮上这些我们认为女性化的装饰。那些不愿随波逐流的人类学家发现自己被同行排挤，被专业学社联合宣言所谴责，被以诽谤罪起诉，甚至被指控犯有种族屠杀罪。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">To be sure, it is easy to come away from tribal battles with the impression that they are fairly harmless in comparison with modern warfare. Men with a grievance against a neighboring village challenge its men to appear at a given time and place. The two sides face off at a distance at which their missiles can barely reach each other. They talk trash, cursing and insulting and boasting, and fire arrows or chuck spears while dodging those from the other side. When a warrior or two are injured or killed, they call it a day. These noisy spectacles led observers to conclude that warfare among primitive peoples was ritualistic and symbolic, very different from the glorious carnage of more advanced peoples. The historian William Eckhardt, who is often cited for his claim that violence has vastly increased over the course of history, wrote, "Bands of gathering-hunters, numbering about 25 to 50 people each, could hardly have made much of a war. There would not have been enough people to fight, few weapons with which to fight, little to fight about, and no surplus to pay for the fighting."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="确实，与现代战争相比，人们很容易产生部落战斗杀伤力有限的印象。一伙对邻村怀有怨愤的家伙，只能在遭遇仇家的那个特定时间和特定地点动手。而双方隔空叫阵，距离之远，他们的“导弹”一般很难落到对方的阵地。双方恶语相向，诅咒、叫骂、侮辱、吹牛皮，外加张弓搭箭，或者投出几只梭镖，同时自己也不会忘记避闪对方发射过来的利器。每当有一两个武士负伤或是阵亡，就到了他们叫停的时候了。这种喧闹的场面，让观察者认为原始人的战争是一种仪式和象征，同后来场面宏大的战争屠杀完全不同。历史学家威廉·埃克哈特（William Eckhardt）写过：“采集狩猎团伙，通常25人到50人一伙，很难发动像样的战争。既缺乏战斗人员和像样的武器，也没有多少理由开战，更没有剩余支付战斗的费用。”他认为历史上的暴力正在剧增的观点，经常被人所引用。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But the main distortion comes from a failure to distinguish the two kinds of violence that turned out to be so important in studies of chimpanzees: battles and raids. It is the sneaky raids, not the noisy battles, that kill in large numbers. A party of men will slink into an enemy village before dawn, fire arrows into the first men who emerge from their huts in the morning to pee, and then shoot the others as they rush out of their huts to see what the commotion is about. They may thrust their spears through walls, shoot arrows through doorways or chimneys, and set the huts on fire. They can kill a lot of drowsy people before the villagers organize themselves in defense, by which time the attackers have melted back into the forest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最主要的扭曲还是在于没有区别两种不同的暴力：战斗和偷袭。对黑猩猩的研究说明，这种区分是十分重要的。偷偷摸摸的袭击所造成的伤亡数量远远大于喧嚣的战斗。一伙男人在凌晨潜入敌人的村庄，射杀第一个从茅屋中出来解手的男人，接着向涌出茅屋察看动静的其他村民放箭。他们可以用梭镖刺穿茅屋的草墙，也可以从门口或烟囱口向屋内放箭，并放火烧屋。在村民们能够组织自卫之前，很多睡眼惺忪的人已经被撂倒，而偷袭者迅即溜回森林。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Only in the past fifteen years have scholars with no political ax to grind, such as Lawrence Keeley, Steven LeBlanc, Azar Gat, and Johan van der Dennen, begun to compile systematic reviews of the frequency and damage of fighting in large samples of nonstate peoples. The actual death counts from primitive warfare show that the apparent harmlessness of a single battle is deceptive. For one thing, a skirmish may escalate into all-out combat that leaves the battlefield strewn with bodies. Also, when bands of a few dozen men confront each other on a regular basis, even one or two deaths per battle can add up to a rate of casualties that is high by any standard.</div>

<div class="line_en">Men in nonstate societies (and they are almost always men) are deadly serious about war, not just in their tactics but in their armaments, which include chemical, biological, and antipersonnel weapons. Arrowheads may be coated with toxins extracted from venomous animals, or with putrefied tissue that causes the wound to fester. The arrowhead may be designed to break away from its shaft, making it difficult for the victim to pull it out. Warriors often reward themselves with trophies, especially heads, scalps, and genitals. They literally take no prisoners, though occasionally they will drag one back to the village to be tortured to death. William Bradford of the Mayflower pilgrims observed of the natives of Massachusetts, "Not being content only to kill and take away life, [they] delight to torment men in the most bloody manner that may be, flaying some alive with the shells of fishes, cutting off members and joints of others by piecemeal and broiling on the coals, eat collops of their flesh in their sight while they live."</div>

Another stealthy but effective way to decimate an enemy is by ambuscade: a war party can hide in the forest along a hunting route and dispatch enemy men as they walk by. Still another tactic is treachery: the men can pretend to make peace with an enemy, invite them to a feast, and at a prearranged signal stab the unsuspecting guests. As for any solitary man who blunders into their territory, the policy is the same as it is with chimpanzees: shoot on sight.</div>

<div class="line_en">On approaching the enemy's quarters, they laid themselves down in ambush until all was quiet, and finding most of them asleep, laying about in groups, our party rushed upon them, killing three on the spot and wounding several others. The enemy fled precipitately, leaving their war implements in the hands of their assailants and their wounded to be beaten to death by boomerangs, three loud shouts closing the victors' triumph. The bodies of the dead they mutilated in a shocking manner, cutting the arms and legs off, with flints, and shells, and tomahawks.</div>

<div class="line_en">Some weeks later, the Kobuk caribou hunters returned home to find the rotting remains of their wives and children and vowed revenge. A year or two after that, they headed north to the upper Noatak to seek it. They soon located a large body of Nuataagmiut and secretly followed them. One morning the men in the Nuataagmiut camp spotted a large band of caribou and went off in pursuit. While they were gone, the Kobuk raiders killed every woman in the camp. Then they cut off their vulvas, strung them on a line, and headed quickly toward home.</div>

<div class="line_en">Cannibalism has long been treated as the quintessence of primitive savagery, and in reaction many anthropologists used to dismiss reports of cannibalism as blood libels by neighboring tribes. But forensic archaeology has recently shown that cannibalism was widespread in human prehistory. The evidence includes human bones that bear human teethmarks or that had been cracked and cooked like those of animals and thrown out in the kitchen trash.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="人们一直认为吃人是原始野人习俗的精髓，但许多人类学家对有关人类相食的报道嗤之以鼻，认为是部落间的血腥诽谤。但最新的法医考古发现显示，食人在史前人类中广泛存在。证据包括，有人齿啃咬痕迹的人类骨骼，还有和其他动物骨头一样被敲碎和烹煮过的人类骨骼，而且被丢弃在厨房的垃圾中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Some of the butchered bones date back 800,000 years, to the time when Homo heidelbergensis, a common ancestor of modern humans and Neanderthals, first appears on the evolutionary stage. Traces of human blood proteins have also been found in cooking pots and in ancient human excrement. Cannibalism may have been so common in prehistory as to have affected our evolution: our genomes contain genes that appear to be defenses against the prion diseases transmitted by cannibalism. All this is consistent with eyewitness accounts, such as this transcription by a missionary of a Maori warrior taunting the preserved head of an enemy chief:</div>

<div class="line_en">Foraging peoples can invade to gain territory, such as hunting grounds, watering holes, the banks or mouths of rivers, and sources of valued minerals like flint, obsidian, salt, or ochre. They may raid livestock or caches of stored food. And very often they fight over women. Men may raid a neighboring village for the express purpose of kidnapping women, whom they gang-rape and distribute as wives. They may raid for some other reason and take the women as a bonus. Or they may raid to claim women who had been promised to them in marriage but were not delivered at the agreed-upon time. And sometimes young men attack for trophies, coups, and other signs of aggressive prowess, especially in societies where they are a prerequisite to attaining adult status.</div>

<div class="line_en">Many scholars have found the image of harmless foragers to be plausible because they had trouble imagining the means and motives that could drive them to war. Recall, for example, Eckhardt's claim that hunter-gatherers had "little to fight about." But organisms that have evolved by natural selection always have something to fight about (which doesn't, of course, mean that they will always fight). Hobbes noted that humans in particular have three reasons for quarrel: gain, safety, and credible deterrence. People in nonstate societies fight about all three.</div>

<div class="line_en">People in nonstate societies also invade for safety. The security dilemma or Hobbesian trap is very much on their minds, and they may form an alliance with nearby villages if they fear they are too small, or launch a preemptive strike if they fear that an enemy alliance is getting too big. One Yanomamö man in Amazonia told an anthropologist, "We are tired of fighting. We don't want to kill anymore. But the others are treacherous and cannot be trusted."</div>

<div class="line_en">But in most surveys the most commonly cited motive for warfare is vengeance, which serves as a crude deterrent to potential enemies by raising the anticipated long-term costs of an attack. In the Iliad, Achilles describes a feature of human psychology that can be found in cultures throughout the world: revenge "far sweeter than flowing honey wells up like smoke in the breasts of man." Foraging and tribal people avenge theft, adultery, vandalism, poaching, abduction of women, soured deals, alleged sorcery, and previous acts of violence. One cross-cultural survey found that in 95 percent of societies, people explicitly endorse the idea of taking a life for a life. Tribal people not only feel the smoke welling up in their breasts but know that their enemies feel it too. That is why they sometimes massacre every last member of a village they raid: they anticipate that any survivors would seek revenge for their slain kinsmen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在大部分调查中，最经常提到的战争动机是复仇，其本质是要增加敌人对进犯的预期成本，向潜在的对手显示凶狠的威慑力。在《荷马史诗·伊利亚特》中，阿喀琉斯对人类这一心理特性进行了描述。世界上没有一种文化会对他的话感到陌生，他说，复仇“远比流淌的蜂蜜还要甜美，从男子的胸中奔涌而出”。觅食群组和部落人对盗窃、通奸、破坏、偷猎、抢劫妇女、背信弃义、疑似巫术以及以往的暴行等等进行报复。一项跨文化的研究发现，95%的人类社会都接受一命偿一命的观念。部落民不仅感到复仇在自己的胸中奔涌，而且知道复仇也翻滚在敌人的心中。这也就是为什么他们要一个不留地杀光所有的敌人，因为幸存者一定要为被杀的族人复仇。">查看中文翻译</div>
