<div class="line_en">I could hear the murmur of Maxim's voice in the little room beyond. I had a sick expectant feeling at the pit of my stomach. The sound of the telephone ringing seemed to have woken every nerve in my body. I had sat there on the floor beside Maxim in a sort of dream, his hand in mine, my face against his shoulder. I had listened to his story, and part of me went with him like a shadow in his tracks. I too had killed Rebecca, I too had sunk the boat there in the bay. I had listened beside him to the wind and water. I had waited for Mrs Danvers' knocking on the door. All this I had suffered with him, all this and more beside. But the rest of me sat there on the carpet, unmoved and detached, thinking and caring for one thing only, repeating a phrase over and over again, "He did not love Rebecca, he did not love Rebecca." Now, at the ringing of the telephone, these two selves merged and became one again. I was the self that I had always been, I was not changed. But something new had come upon me that had not been before. My heart, for all its anxiety and doubt, was light and free. I knew then that I was no longer afraid of Rebecca. I did not hate her any more. Now that I knew her to have been evil and vicious and rotten I did not hate her any more. She could not hurt me. I could go to the morning-room and sit down at her desk and touch her pen and look at her writing on the pigeon-holes, and I should not mind. I could go to her room in the west wing, stand by the window even as I had done this morning, and I should not be afraid.</div>

<div class="line_en">Maxim went into the little room and shut the door. Robert came in a few minutes afterwards to clear away the tea. I stood up, my back turned to him so that he should not see my face. I wondered when they would begin to know, on the estate, in the servants' hall, in Kerrith itself. I wondered how long it took for news to trickle through.</div>

<div class="line_en">I was free now to be with Maxim, to touch him, and hold him, and love him. I would never be a child again. It would not be I, I, I any longer; it would be we, it would be us. We would be together. We would face this trouble together, he and I. Captain Searle, and the diver, and Frank, and Mrs Danvers, and Beatrice, and the men and women of Kerrith reading their newspapers, could not break us now. Our happiness had not come too late. I was not young any more. I was not shy. I was not afraid. I would fight for Maxim. I would lie and perjure and swear, I would blaspheme and pray. Rebecca had not won. Rebecca had lost.</div>

<div class="line_en">Rebecca's power had dissolved into the air, like the mist had done. She would never haunt me again. She would never stand behind me on the stairs, sit beside me in the dining-room, lean down from the gallery and watch me standing in the hall. Maxim had never loved her. I did not hate her any more. Her body had come back, her boat had been found with its queer prophetic name, Je Reviens, but I was free of her for ever.</div>

<div class="line_en">The telephone began ringing again from the little room. There was something sickening about the shrill urgent summons of the bell. Maxim and I looked at one another. Then he went into the room to answer it, shutting the door behind him as he had done before. The queer nagging pain had not left me yet. It returned again in greater force with the ringing of the bell. The feel of it took me back across the years to my childhood. This was the pain I had known when I was very small and the maroons had sounded in the streets of London, and I had sat, shivering, not understanding, under a little cupboard beneath the stairs. It was the same feeling, the same pain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小房间里，电话铃声再次响起。那刺耳、急促的声音委实有点怕人。迈克西姆同我交换了一个眼色，接着走进小房间去听电话。同刚才那次一样，他一进屋就随手把门带上。那阵异样的揪心的痛楚本来就还没消失，电话铃一响，痛得更凶了。这时的感觉使我回想起久远的童年。当年，我还是个小孩，每听到伦敦街头传来鞭炮声，总是感受到此刻的这种痛楚。我会莫名其妙地钻到楼梯下面的碗橱底下，坐在那儿吓得发抖。当时当地的痛苦感觉同此刻一模一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We went on sitting in the library. Maxim picked up a book but I know he did not read. Now and again I saw him lift his head and listen, as though he heard the telephone again. But it did not ring again. No one disturbed us. We dressed for dinner as usual. It seemed incredible to me that this time last night I had been putting on my white dress, sitting before the mirror at my dressing-table, arranging the curled wig. It was like an old forgotten nightmare, something remembered months afterwards with doubt and disbelief. We had dinner. Frith served us, returned from his afternoon. His face was solemn, expressionless. I wondered if he had been in Kerrith, if he had heard anything.</div>

<div class="line_en">After dinner we went back again to the library. We did not talk much. I sat on the floor at Maxim's feet, my head against his knees. He ran his fingers through my hair. Different from his old abstracted way. It was not like stroking Jasper any more. I felt his finger tips on the scalp of my head. Sometimes he kissed me. Sometimes he said things to me. There were no shadows between us any more, and when we were silent it was because the silence came to us of our own asking. I wondered how it was I could be so happy when our little world about us was so black. It was a strange sort of happiness. Not what I had dreamt about or expected. It was not the sort of happiness I had imagined in the lonely hours. There was nothing feverish or urgent about this. It was a quiet, still happiness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="晚饭后，我们又回到藏书室。两人没多交谈。我在迈克西姆的脚旁席地而坐，头倚在他膝上。他用手指梳理我的头发，与过去那种心不在焉的样子大不相同，不能再同爱抚长耳狗杰斯珀相提并论了。我感觉到他的手指尖在我头皮上移动。我时而吻我，时而对我说话。我俩之间已不再横隔着谁的阴影。有时两人都不说话，那是因为两人都希望沉默一会儿。我弄不明白，当周围的圈子危机四伏的时候，我怎么如此心满意足。这种心满意足的情绪很有点不寻常哩，并不是我梦寐以求、翘首期待的那种幸福，也不像子身独处时凭想象描绘的那种美满生活。这种满足的心境既不带狂热，也不给人任何转瞬即逝的威胁。这是一种无声无息的宁静的幸福。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It must have rained in the night, for when I woke the next morning, just after seven, and got up, and looked out of the window, I saw the roses in the garden below were folded and drooping, and the grass banks leading to the woods were wet and silver. There was a little smell in the air of mist and damp, the smell that comes with the first fall of the leaf. I wondered if autumn would come upon us two months before her time.</div>

<div class="line_en">Maxim had not woken me when he got up at five. He must have crept from his bed and gone through the bathroom to his dressing-room without a sound. He would be down there now, in the bay, with Colonel Julyan, and Captain Searle, and the men from the lighter. The lighter would be there, the crane and the chain, and Rebecca's boat coming to the surface. I thought about it calmly, coolly, without feeling. I pictured them all down there in the bay, and the little dark hull of the boat rising slowly to the surface, sodden, dripping, the grass-green seaweed and shells clinging to her sides. When they lifted her on to the lighter the water would stream from her sides, back into the sea again. The wood of the little boat would look soft and grey, pulpy in places.

<div class="line_en">I got up and had my bath and dressed, and went down to breakfast at nine o'clock as usual. There were a lot of letters on my plate. Letters from people thanking us for the dance. I skimmed through them, I did not read them all. Frith wanted to know whether to keep the breakfast hot for Maxim. I told him I did not know when he would be back. He had to go out very early, I said. Frith did not say anything. He looked very solemn, very grave. I wondered again if he knew.</div>

Presently Maxim would come back and tell me. Whatever happened I must be calm and quiet. Whatever happened I must not be afraid. I cut my roses and took them back into the morning-room. The carpet had been dusted, and the fallen petals removed. I began to arrange the flowers in the vases that Robert had filled with water.

I suppose Frith was thinking about it too, and I thought how much easier it would be if we cast aside convention and let him join in with us, if he had anything to say. Robert came with the drinks. Our plates were changed. The second course was handed. Mrs Danvers had not forgotten my wish for hot food. I took something out of a casserole covered in mushroom sauce.</div>

I wanted to go with him, but he insisted on going alone. He was not in a fit state to undertake anything of the sort."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“鉴于当时的情况，认错尸体再自然也没有了，”弗兰克赶忙接嘴说。“行政当局写信给迈克西姆，要他到埃奇库姆比走一趟。还没等他到场，大家已有先入之见，都说那就是她的尸体，再说，迈克西姆当时正生病。我提出跟他同行，可他坚持要独个儿去。他当时的精神状态实在不宜去处理这类事情。”">查看中文翻译</div>

"It's just a case of you re-affirming identification, and then getting Tabb, who you say converted the boat when your wife brought her from France, just to give his piece of evidence that the boat was seaworthy and in good order when he last had her in his yard. It's just red-tape, you know. But it has to be done. No, what bothers me is the wretched publicity of the affair. So sad and unpleasant for you and your wife."</div>

Mrs de Winter must have known how the wind comes down like a funnel in that bay, and that it was not safe to leave the helm of a small boat like that. She must have sailed alone over that spot scores of times. And then the moment came, she took a chance -- and the chance killed her. It's a lesson to all of us."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我想我们大家迟早都会犯这样那样的判断错误，”朱利安上校说。“接着，就得为此付出代价。德温特夫人一定了解海湾里的风势，狂风如何像透过漏斗一样吹下；她也明白，就这样离开一艘小船的舵位是不安全的。在那一带的海面上，她一定独自航行过数十次。然而，生死攸关的时刻到了，她冒了个险，这一冒险就送了命。这事对我们大家都是个教训。”">查看中文翻译</div>

It's the sort of thing a novice would do. In that particular place too, just by the ridge."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Of course. Of course. Well, we shall never know. And I don't suppose we should be any the better for it if we did. As I said before, I wish I could stop this inquest but I can't. I'm trying to arrange it for Tuesday morning, and it will be as short as possible. Just a formal matter. But I'm afraid we shan't be able to keep the reporters out of it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然，当然。嗯，至于真相，咱们大概永远无从知道了。不过，我认为即使了解当时的经过情形。也于事无补，还是我刚才说过的那句话，我但愿能阻止当局举行传讯，可我又实在无能为力。我正在安排日程，准备把传讯放在星期二上午举行。另外，我会尽可能使传讯在最短时间之内结束。就这么走一个过场。不过，我们恐怕没法不让记者到场。”">查看中文翻译</div>
