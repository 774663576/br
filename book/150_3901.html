<div class="line_en">All through the afternoon she thought of what Charlie had said about Walter. They were dining out that evening and when he came back from the Club she was dressing. He knocked at her door.</div>

<div class="line_en">He said nothing more, but went to his own room. His voice had that constrained note which she had heard in it the night before. She felt fairly sure of herself now. She was ready before he was and when he came downstairs she was already seated in the car.</div>

<div class="line_en">She made an observation or two as they drove down the hill, but he answered curtly. She shrugged her shoulders; she was growing a trifle impatient: if he wanted to sulk, let him, she didn't care. They drove in silence till they reached their destination. It was a large dinner party. There were too many people and too many courses. While Kitty chatted gaily with her neighbours she watched Walter. He was deathly pale and his face was pinched.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="车子开向山下的时候，她发表了一两项评论，但只得到了他草草的回应。她耸起了肩头，她的耐性也是有限度的，要是他意在表示愠怒，请他随便好了，她会奉陪的。剩下的旅程全部被沉默替代。宴会场面颇为壮观，人头攒动，菜式新颖。凯蒂兴高采烈地与临桌攀谈，同时不忘了观察瓦尔特两眼。他脸如死灰，脸上的肌肉扭曲到了一起。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Walter did not as usual when they were dining out give her a smiling glance now and then. He never looked at her. She had noticed that when he came down to the car he kept his eyes averted, and he did the same when, with his usual politeness, he gave her his hand to alight. Now, talking with the women on either side of him, he did not smile, but looked at them with steady and unblinking eyes; and really his eyes looked enormous and in that pale face coal black. His face was set and stern.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="进餐的当儿，瓦尔特不像往常时不时投来微笑的目光，他始终没向她这边瞟过一眼。她记得上车那会儿他的眼睛就有意回避，等车门一开，他虽照旧绅士地擎起手臂挽她下车，然而却不敢用正脸看她。他正与两边的女士翘首交谈，脸上不但毫无笑容，还对她们投以一对死鱼一般从不眨巴的眼睛。那双眼睛可谓令人胆寒，在那张惨白的脸上俨然似一对黑洞。他的表情像是冻结在了脸上，既严酷又苛刻。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The idea of those unfortunate ladies trying to indulge in small talk with that grim mask not a little diverted her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几位命运不济的女士正想方设法维持与一张苦相脸的闲谈，想到这儿凯蒂就觉得好笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Of course he knew; there was no doubt about that, and he was furious with her. Why hadn't he said anything? Was it really because, though angry and hurt, he loved her so much that he was afraid she would leave him? The thought made her ever so slightly despise him, but good- naturedly: after all, he was her husband and he provided her with board and lodging; so long as he didn't interfere with her and let her do as she liked she would be quite nice to him. On the other hand perhaps his silence was due merely to a morbid timidity. Charlie was right when he said that no one would hate a scandal more than Walter. He never made a speech if he could help it. He had told her once that when he was subpoenaed as a witness on a case where he was to give expert evidence he had hardly slept for a week before. His shyness was a disease.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他显然已经知道真相，这一点是毋庸置疑的。他也必然对她心生怨堵，但是又为什么至今缄口不提？难道他是爱她太深，怕此事一旦闹开，她就可能离他而去，因此不惜忍下怨恨和伤痛？但这只会让凯蒂对他更加不敢高看，不过他毕竟身为自己的丈夫，膳食日用、宿住出行还都得靠他。但凡他不对她的事横加干涉，能叫她随心所愿，还是应该对他好点儿。但是话说回来，他闭了嘴也可能仅仅出于胆小怕事。查理就说过，谈到害怕惹火生事之人，无人能与瓦尔特相比，这话怕是说到点子上了。开口发言对他来说能避则避。他就曾对她讲过，有一回被法庭传唤作为证人提供专家证词，害得他之前的一个礼拜没睡过一次好觉。他的害羞已经到了病态的地步。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And there was another thing: men were very vain, and so long as no one knew what had happened it might be that Walter would be content to ignore it. Then she wondered whether by any possibility Charlie was right when he suggested that Walter knew which side his bread was buttered. Charlie was the most popular man in the Colony and soon would be Colonial Secretary. He could be very useful to Walter: on the other hand he could make himself very unpleasant if Walter put his back up. Her heart exulted as she thought of her lover's strength and determination; she felt so defenceless in his virile arms. Men were strange: it would never have occurred to her that Walter was capable of such baseness, and yet you never knew; perhaps his seriousness was merely a mask for a mean and pettifogging nature. The more she considered it the more likely it seemed that Charlie was right; and she turned her glance once more on her husband. There was no indulgence in it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="除此之外还不能忘了男人都是爱要面子的。这事如果没有传到别人的耳朵里，瓦尔特求之不得想要忘了它呢。接下来她还要揣摩一下查理的另一番话：瓦尔特会不会为了饭碗而取悦查理。不错，查理是这块殖民地上最受欢迎的人，且不久就会荣任布政司。这个人对瓦尔特来说大有用处，要是把他的老底抖搂出来，恐怕不会捞到一点好处。想到有这样一位坚定、果敢的情人，她不禁为之陶醉。每当他强壮有力的手臂将她搂在怀里，她的身体就会顷刻变得绵软无力。男人们总是叫你捉摸不透，看看瓦尔特，无论如何也不会想到他会是个见风使舵、见利忘义的人，然而知面不知心。说不定他貌似庄重的外表之下隐藏着低贱卑劣的企图。她越想越觉得查理的话有道理。这时她朝她的丈夫瞧了一眼，他正一个人晾在那儿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It happened that just then the women on either side of him were talking with their neighbours and he was left alone. He was staring straight in front of him, forgetful of the party, and his eyes were filled with a mortal sadness. It gave Kitty a shock.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="身边的女士正巧在和另一边的邻座谈得火热，没人跟他搭腔。他呆呆地望着前面，似乎已经把晚会忘得一干二净。他的眼神看上去悲痛欲绝。这让凯蒂浑身一震。">查看中文翻译</div>
