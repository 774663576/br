<div class="line_en">Hasina had wanted to come too, had begged her father, but he wouldn't allow it. The trip was Babi's idea. Though he could hardly afford it on his salary, he'd hired a driver for the day. He wouldn't disclose anything to Laila about their destination except to say that, with it, he was contributing to her education.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈西娜本来也想去，求了她父亲，但他不肯答应。是爸爸提议出来玩的。尽管他薪水微薄，出来玩又需要很多钱，但他还是在这一天请了个司机。至于他们要去哪里，他半点都没跟莱拉透露，只说要去的那个地方很有教育意义。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Through Laila's window, the landscape shifted from snowcapped peaks to deserts to canyons and sun-scorched outcroppings of rocks. Along the way, they passed mud houses with thatched roofs and fields dotted with bundles of wheat. Pitched out in the dusty fields, here and there, Laila recognized the black tents of Koochi nomads. And, frequently, the carcasses of burned-out Soviet tanks and wrecked helicopters. This, she thought, was Ahmad and Noor's Afghanistan. This, here in the provinces, was where the war was being fought, after all. Not in Kabul. Kabul was largely at peace. Back in Kabul, if not for the occasional bursts of gunfire, if not for the Soviet soldiers smoking on the sidewalks and the Soviet jeeps always bumping through the streets, war might as well have been a rumor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱拉坐在窗边，看着车外的景色从峰顶覆盖着白雪的山脉变成沙漠、峡谷，再变成被太阳烤得干裂的、盘踞在地面上的大岩石。一路上，他们经过一些用茅草搭成屋顶的泥屋和散落着一捆捆小麦的田地。莱拉时不时还能见到游牧部落的黑色帐篷，安扎在尘土飞扬的泥地上。更为常见的是被烧毁的苏联坦克和坠毁的直升飞机的残骸。她心里想，这就是艾哈迈德和努尔的阿富汗了。原来真的发生过一场战争，就在这儿，在这些乡下地方。喀布尔没有战争。喀布尔大体上平安无事。在喀布尔，如果不是那些时不时爆发的枪声，如果不是人行道上总是有苏联的士兵在吸烟，街道上总是能见到苏联的吉普摇摇晃晃地前进，战争可能也只是一段传闻而已。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The two Buddhas were enormous, soaring much higher than she had imagined from all the photos she'd seen of them. Chiseled into a sun-bleached rock cliff, they peered down at them, as they had nearly two thousand years before, Laila imagined, at caravans crossing the valley on the Silk Road. On either side of them, along the overhanging niche, the cliff was pocked with myriad caves.</div>

<div class="line_en">As they climbed, Babi told them that Bamiyan had once been a thriving Buddhist center until it had fallen under Islamic Arab rule in the ninth century. The sandstone cliffs were home to Buddhist monks who carved caves in them to use as living quarters and as sanctuary for weary traveling pilgrims. The monks, Babi said, painted beautiful frescoes along the walls and roofs of their caves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="向上爬的时候，爸爸告诉他们，巴米扬曾经是昌盛繁荣的佛教中心，后来在九世纪的时候，它落进了信奉伊斯兰教的阿拉伯人手里。这儿的砂岩峭壁过去是很多和尚的家园，他们在峭壁上凿开洞穴，当成自己的住所，也供过往的香客暂住。爸爸说，这些和尚在洞穴的墙壁和洞顶上绘了很多美丽的画。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We're standing atop its head," he said, wiping his brow with a handkerchief. "There's a niche over here where we can look out."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“有一段时间，”他说，“有五千个和尚在这些洞穴中隐居修行。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They inched over to the craggy overhang and, standing side by side, with Babi in the middle, gazed down on the valley.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们沿着那条崎岖的悬道走过去，并排站着，爸爸在中间，俯视着下方的峡谷。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tariq was badly out of breath when they reached the top. Babi was panting too. But his eyes shone with excitement.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们登顶的时候，塔里克几乎喘不过气来。爸爸也在喘息。但他眼里闪烁着兴奋的光芒。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Bamiyan Valley below was carpeted by lush farming fields. Babi said they were green winter wheat and alfalfa, potatoes too. The fields were bordered by poplars and crisscrossed by streams and irrigation ditches, on the banks of which tiny female figures squatted and washed clothes. Babi pointed to rice paddies and barley fields draping the slopes. It was autumn, and Laila could make out people in bright tunics on the roofs of mud brick dwellings laying out the harvest to dry. The main road going through the town was poplar-lined too. There were small shops and teahouses and street-side barbers on either side of it. Beyond the village, beyond the river and the streams, Laila saw foothills, bare and dusty brown, and, beyond those, as beyond everything else in Afghanistan, the snowcapped Hindu Kush.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="下方的巴米扬峡谷遍布着长势繁茂的农田。爸爸说它们是绿色的冬小麦和紫花苜蓿，也有一些是土豆。田地四周是高耸的白杨树，中间纵横交错的是溪流和沟渠，几个细小的女性身影蹲在岸边洗衣服。爸爸指着一片水稻田和几乎没有种植什么作物的山坡。已是入秋天气，莱拉能够看见一些人穿着颜色鲜艳的束腰外衣，站在泥砖屋的屋顶上晾晒谷物。通往城里的大路两旁也种着白杨树。路的两边有小店铺、茶馆和在路边给人剪头发的理发师。莱拉的眼光越过小山村，越过河流和沟渠，看到一片低矮的褐色土丘，光秃秃的；而在这片土丘之外，在阿富汗的一切之外，是白雪覆顶的兴都库什山脉。">查看中文翻译</div>

But I also wanted you to see your country's heritage, children, to learn of its rich past. You see, some things I can teach you. Some you learn from books. But there are things that, well, you just have to see and feel."</div>

<div class="line_en">A wave of affection overcame Laila. From then on, she would always remember Babi this way: reminiscing about Mammy, with his elbows on the rock, hands cupping his chin, his hair ruffled by the wind, eyes crinkled against the sun.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh, many times. Before the boys were born. After too. Your mother, she used to be adventurous then, and… so alive. She was just about the liveliest, happiest person I'd ever met." He smiled at the memory. "She had this laugh. I swear it's why I married her, Laila, for that laugh. It bulldozed you. You stood no chance against it."</div>

She can't hide either. She never could. Me, I suppose I'm different. I tend to… But it broke me too, the boys dying. I miss them too. Not a day passes that I… It's very hard, Laila. So very hard." He squeezed the inner corners of his eyes with his thumb and forefinger. When he tried to talk, his voice broke. He pulled his lips over his teeth and waited. He took a long, deep breath, looked at her. "But I'm glad I have you. Every day, I thank God for you. Every single day.

<div class="line_en">Laila remembered Mammy telling Babi once that she had married a man who had no convictions. Mammy didn't understand. She didn't understand that if she looked into a mirror, she would find the one unfailing conviction of his life looking right back at her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱拉记得妈妈有一次对爸爸说，说她嫁了一个没有信念的男人。妈妈不明白。她并不明白，其实她自己就是他生命中最为坚定不移的信念。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And Babi would never leave without her, Laila knew, even though Mammy was no more a wife to him now than she was a mother to Laila. For Mammy, he would brush aside this daydream of his the way he flicked specks of flour from his coat when he got home from work. And so they would stay. They would stay until the war ended. And they would stay for whatever came after war.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而她不走，爸爸也不会离开，这一点莱拉很清楚，即使妈妈现在既不像是她的母亲，也不像是他的妻子。为了妈妈，他会像他下班回家之后弹开外套上的面粉一样，把自己的白日梦抛开。所以他们会留下来。他们会留下来，直到战争结束。而且不管战争结束之后发生什么事情，他们都会留下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">LATER, after they'd eaten a lunch of boiled eggs and potatoes with bread, Tariq napped beneath a tree on the banks of a gurgling stream. He slept with his coat neatly folded into a pillow, his hands crossed on his chest. The driver went to the village to buy almonds. Babi sat at the foot of a thick-trunked acacia tree reading a paperback. Laila knew the book; he'd read it to her once. It told the story of an old fisherman named Santiago who catches an enormous fish. But by the time he sails his boat to safety, there is nothing left of his prize fish; the sharks have torn it to pieces.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="中午到了，他们吃了水煮蛋、土豆和面包；午饭后，他们来到一条水声潺潺的沟渠旁边，塔里克在岸上的一棵树下面打盹。他把外套整整齐齐地叠成枕头，双手交叉在胸口，呼呼睡去。司机到村里去买杏仁。爸爸坐在一株粗壮的金合欢树下面看着一本平装书。莱拉知道那本书，他曾经读给她听。它讲的是一个叫圣地亚哥的老人抓住一条大鱼的故事。等到他安然返航时，他获得的那条大鱼已经没什么剩下的了，鲨鱼已经把它撕成碎片。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Laila thought again about Babi's little dream. Somewhere near the sea.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱拉又想起了爸爸的小小梦想。靠近海边的某个地方。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Laila watched its wings catch glints of sunlight as it buzzed from one blade of grass to another. They flashed purple, then green, orange. Across the stream, a group of local Hazara boys were picking patties of dried cow dung from the ground and stowing them into burlap sacks tethered to their backs. Somewhere, a donkey brayed. A generator sputtered to life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱拉看见它的翅膀上闪耀着太阳的光芒，嗡嗡地从一片草叶飞向另一片草叶。蜻蜓的翅膀反射出紫色、绿色、橙色的光线。小河彼岸，一群本地的哈扎拉男孩从地面上拾起晒干的小块牛粪，将牛粪丢进系在他们背上的粗麻袋。不知道从哪儿传来一声驴叫。发动机突突开动的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Laila sat on the edge of the stream, dipping her feet into the cool water. Overhead, mosquitoes hummed and cottonwood seeds danced. A dragonfly whirred nearby.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱拉坐在小河边，双脚浸泡在冰冷的河水中。在她头顶，蚊子嗡嗡叫，三叶杨的花絮飘来飘去。一只蜻蜓在旁边飞舞。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was something she hadn't told Babi up there atop the Buddha: that, in one important way, she was glad they couldn't go. She would miss Giti and her pinch-faced earnestness, yes, and Hasina too, with her wicked laugh and reckless clowning around. But, mostly, Laila remembered all too well the inescapable drudgery of those four weeks without Tariq when he had gone to Ghazni. She remembered all too well how time had dragged without him, how she had shuffled about feeling waylaid, out of balance. How could she ever cope with his permanent absence?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在大佛上面，她有些话没跟爸爸说：有一个非常重要的原因，让她为他们走不成而高兴。她会怀念吉提和她那张紧绷的、真诚的脸庞，是的，她也会想起哈西娜，怀念她那肆无忌惮的笑声和到处寻人开心的作风。但是，最重要的是，莱拉非常清楚地记得，在塔里克离开她去加兹尼的那四个星期中她的日子变得多么难熬。她非常清楚地记得在没有他的日子里，时间过得有多么慢，她自己有多么心烦意乱。她如何能够忍受永远和他分离？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"But the communist regime is staying," she said. "Najibullah is the Soviets' puppet president. He's not going anywhere. No, the war will go on. This is not the end."</div>

<div class="line_en">"They signed a treaty!" he said. "In Geneva. It's official! They're leaving. Within nine months, there won't be any more Soviets in Afghanistan!"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Najibullah won't last," said Babi.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“纳吉布拉的日子不会长久的。”爸爸说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Maybe it was senseless to want to be near a person so badly here in a country where bullets had shredded her own brothers to pieces. But all Laila had to do was picture Tariq going at Khadim with his leg and then nothing in the world seemed more sensible to her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这个自己的哥哥被炮弹炸得粉身碎骨的国家，也许像她这样如此渴望和某个人相处是毫无意义的。但莱拉总是忍不住想起塔里克扛着他的假腿向卡迪姆走去的画面，然后，世界上再也没有能让她觉得更有意义的事情了。">查看中文翻译</div>
