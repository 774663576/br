<meta content="父母在我九年级前的夏天离了婚。父亲很快就有了新欢。虽然母亲从来没明说过，但我想实际上这就是他们离婚的原因。他们离婚后，我几乎没见过父亲。母亲的举止比以前任何时候都更陌生。她还不是情绪不稳定，她就是冷漠。疏离。我母亲是那种把笑脸给全世界但对我却没什么好脸色的人。她从来不跟我多说话——不说她的感受，她的生活。她在我这个年龄是什么样子，我知之甚少。她喜欢什么或不喜欢什么，我也不太清楚。有几次她提到她的父母——我从来没见过他们——讲得最多的是她一长大就如何尽可能地远离他们。她从来不跟我说为什么。我问过几次，但她都装作没听见。" name="description"/>

<div class="line_en">After the divorce, I hardly ever saw my father. And my mother acted stranger than ever. It's not that she was unstable or anything: just distant. Remote. My mother is the kind of person who has a happy face for the rest of the world but not a lot left over for me. She's never talked to me much -- not about her feelings, her life. I don't know much about what she was like when she was my age. Don't know much about the things she liked or didn't like. The few times she mentioned her own parents, who I've never met, it was mostly about how she wanted to get as far away from them as she could once she'd grown up. She never told me why. I asked a few times, but she would pretend she hadn't heard me.</div>

<div class="line_en">I didn't want to go to camp that summer. I had wanted to stay with her, to help her through the divorce. But she insisted I go away. I figured she wanted the alone time, so I gave it to her.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then one day I blurted out that I had a little brother who was deformed. I have absolutely no idea why I said this: it just seemed like an interesting thing to say. And, of course, the reaction I got from the little girls in the bungalow was dramatic. Really? So sorry! That must be tough! Et cetera. Et cetera. I regretted saying this the moment it escaped from my lips, of course: I felt like such a fake. If Via ever found out, I thought, she'd think I was such a weirdo. And I felt like a weirdo. But, I have to admit, there was a part of me that felt a little entitled to this lie. I've known Auggie since I was six years old. I've watched him grow up. I've played with him. I've watched all six episodes of Star Wars for his sake, so I could talk to him about the aliens and bounty hunters and all that. I'm the one that gave him the astronaut helmet he wouldn't take off for two years. I mean, I've kind of earned the right to think of him as my brother.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一天我脱口而出说我有一个畸形的弟弟。我压根儿不知道自己为什么要这么说，也许是觉得有趣。当然，营房里小女孩们的反应非常夸张。真的吗？非常抱歉！肯定很艰难吧！等等。毫无疑问，话一出口我就后悔莫及。我觉得这也太假了。我想，如果维娅知道的话，她一定会觉得我非常奇怪。不过必须承认，我觉得自己还是有点资格撒这个谎的。我从六岁起就认识奥吉了。我一直看着他长大。一直跟他玩。为了他，我看了六部《星球大战》，这样我就可以跟他聊外星人和赏金猎人什么的了。我送了一顶宇航员头盔给他，他戴了两年都不肯脱下来。我的意思是，把他当我的弟弟，这是我的殊荣。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Camp was awful. I hated it. I thought it would be better being a junior counselor, but it wasn't. No one I knew from the previous year had come back, so I didn't know anyone -- not a single person. I'm not even sure why, but I started playing this little make-believe game with the girls in the camp. They'd ask me stuff about myself, and I'd make things up: my parents are in Europe, I told them. I live in a huge townhouse on the nicest street in North River Heights. I have a dog named Daisy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="夏令营很糟糕。我一点都不喜欢。我原本以为做初级辅导员会好一些，但并非如此。上一年我认识的同学一个也没来夏令营，因此我不认识任何人——一个也不认识。莫名其妙地，我跟同营的女孩子玩起了自欺欺人的小游戏。她们对我问东问西，于是我就信口开河：我告诉她们，我的父母在欧洲，我住在北河高地最繁华的一条大街上的一幢豪宅里。我有一条狗，名字叫黛西。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When I got home from camp, I called Ella right away to make plans with her. I don't know why I didn't call Via. I guess I just didn't feel like talking about stuff with her. She would have asked me about my parents, about camp. Ella never really asked me about things. She was an easier friend to have in that way. She wasn't serious like Via. She was fun. She thought it was cool when I dyed my hair pink. She wanted to hear all about those trips through the woods late at night.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从夏令营回到家，我马上给艾拉打电话，约她一起制定计划。不知道为什么，我没有打给维娅。我想我不喜欢跟她聊琐碎的事情。她会问我父母的情况，还有夏令营的情况。艾拉从来不过问我的事情。跟她做朋友更容易一些。她不像维娅那么严肃。她很有趣。她觉得我把头发染成粉色很酷。她愿意听所有那些半夜穿过树林的故事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And the strangest thing is that these lies I told, these fictions, did wonders for my popularity. The other junior counselors heard it from the campers, and they were all over it. Never in my life have I ever been considered one of the "popular" girls in anything, but that summer in camp, for whatever reason, I was the girl everybody wanted to hang out with. Even the girls in bungalow 32 were totally into me. These were the girls at the top of the food chain. They said they liked my hair (though they changed it). They said they liked the way I did my makeup (though they changed that, too). They showed me how to turn my T-shirts into halter tops. We smoked. We snuck out late at night and took the path through the woods to the boys' camp. We hung out with boys.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最奇怪的是，这些谎话，这些杜撰的事情竟然给我带来了惊人的人气。别的初级辅导员从营员们嘴里听说了，他们全都信以为真。在我一生中，从来没有在任何场合被看作“人气女孩”，但这个夏天的夏令营除外，不管出于何种原因，每个人都想跟我在一起。甚至连住在32号营房的女孩们都对我青睐有加。她们都是些人精。她们说喜欢我的头发（不过她们帮我改了发型）。她们说喜欢我化的妆（不过她们也帮我改了）。她们教我怎么把T恤衫塞到吊带背心里面。我们一起抽烟。我们半夜溜出去，穿过林间小路跑到男生夏令营。我们跟男孩子们约会。">查看中文翻译</div>
