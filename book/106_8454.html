<div class="line_en">"Good-bye, Noah," she said quietly. He nodded without speaking. There wasn't anything else to say; they both knew that. She turned from him and left, closing the door behind her. Noah watched her walk to her car, get in, and drive away without looking back. She was a strong woman, he thought to himself, and he knew where Allie got it from.</div>

<div class="line_en">Noah opened the door for Anne Nelson as she went out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After what seemed like an eternity he heard the back door open. He didn't turn to look at her just then -- for some reason he couldn't -- and he listened as she sat in the chair beside him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Noah peeked in the living room, saw Allie sitting with her head down, then went to the back porch, knowing that she needed to be alone. He sat quietly in his rocker and watched the water drifting by as the minutes passed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm sorry," Allie said. "I had no idea this would happen."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Noah shook his head. "Don't be sorry. We both knew it was coming in some form or another."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's still hard."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I know." He finally turned to her, reaching for her hand. "Is there anything I can do to make it easier?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Noah felt a tightness in his stomach. When he finally spoke his voice was steady, but she could hear the pain in it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She shook her head. "No. Not really. I have to do this alone. Besides, I'm not sure what I'm going to say to him yet." She looked down and her voice became softer and a little more distant, as if she were talking to herself. "I guess it depends on him and how much he knows. If my mother was right, he may have suspicions, but he doesn't know anything for sure."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She took a deep breath before going on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You're not going to tell him about us, are you?" "I don't know. I really don't. While I was in the living room, I kept asking myself what I really wanted in my life." She squeezed his hand. "And do you know what the answer was? The answer was that I wanted two things. First, I want you. I want us. I love you and I always have."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But I also want a happy ending without hurting anyone. And I know that if I stayed, people would be hurt. Especially Lon. I wasn't lying when I told you that I love him. He doesn't make me feel the same way you do, but I care for him, and this wouldn't be fair to him. But staying here would also hurt my family and friends. I would be betraying everyone I know.</div>

<div class="line_en">He shook his head and tried to keep his voice steady. "Not really. Not if it means losing you. I can't do that again."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She didn't answer right away. Instead she stood, wiped her face, and walked to the edge of the porch where she leaned against the post. She crossed her arms and watched the water before answering quietly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She bit her lip as she answered. Her voice was beginning to crack. "I don't know. Probably not."</div>

<div class="line_en">"You can't live your life for other people. You've got to do what's right for you, even if it hurts some people you love."</div>

<div class="line_en">"No."</div>

<div class="line_en">She didn't say anything but lowered her head. Noah went on:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I know," she said, "but no matter what I choose I have to live with it. Forever. I have to be able to go forward and not look back anymore. Can you understand that?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It doesn't have to be like this, Allie," he said. "We're adults now, we have the choice we didn't have before. We're meant to be together. We always have been."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Would that be fair to Lon?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Tears began to fill her eyes. "I don't know if I can," she finally whispered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He walked to her side and put his hand on her shoulder. "I don't want to live the rest of my life thinking about you and dreaming of what might have been. Stay with me, Allie."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You're not going to stay, are you?" He smiled weakly. "You want to, but you can't."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, Noah," she said as the tears began again, "please try to understand…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You can. Allie… I can't live my life happily knowing you're with someone else. That would kill a part of me. What we have is rare. It's too beautiful to just throw it away."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She didn't respond. After a moment he gently turned her toward him, took her hands, and stared at her, willing her to look at him. Allie finally faced him with moist eyes. After a long silence, Noah brushed the tears from her cheeks with his fingers, a look of tenderness on his face. His voice caught as he saw what her eyes were telling him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He shook his head to stop her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I know what you're trying to say -- I can see it in your eyes. But I don't want to understand it, Allie. I don't want it to end this way. I don't want it to end at all. But if you leave, we both know we'll never see each other again."</div>

<div class="line_en">He wrapped his arms around her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He kissed her gently, and they embraced as they had when she first got out of her car two days ago. Finally Allie let him go and wiped her tears.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She leaned into him and began to cry harder as Noah fought back his own tears.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I have to get my things, Noah."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Allie, I can't force you to stay with me. But no matter what happens in my life, I'll never forget these last couple of days with you. I've been dreaming about this for years."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Here, Noah. I made this for you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Noah took the drawing and unrolled it slowly, careful not to tear it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He didn't go inside with her. Instead he sat down in the rocker, spent. He watched her go into the house and listened as the sound of her movements faded into nothing. She emerged from the house minutes later with everything she'd brought and walked toward him with her head down. She handed him the drawing she had done yesterday morning. As he took it, he noticed that she hadn't stopped crying.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There were dual images, one overlapping the other. The image in the foreground, which occupied most of the page, was a picture of how he looked now, not fourteen years ago. Noah noticed that she had penciled in every detail of his face, including the scar. It was almost as if she'd copied it from a recent photograph.</div>

</div>
<div class="line_en">Noah opened her car door, and they kissed one more time. Then she slid behind the wheel, never taking her eyes from him. She put the packet of letters and the pocketbook next to her on the seat and fumbled for the keys, then turned the ignition. It started easily, and the engine began to turn over impatiently. It was almost time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's beautiful, Allie. Thank you." He attempted a smile. "I told you that you were an artist." She nodded, her face cast downward, her lips pressed together. It was time for her to go.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The second image was that of the front of the house. The detail there was also incredible, as if she had sketched it while sitting beneath the oak tree.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I love you, Allie."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They walked to her car slowly, without speaking. When they reached it, Noah embraced her again until he could feel the tears welling up in his own eyes. He kissed her lips and both cheeks, then with his finger softly brushed the places he'd kissed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Noah pushed her door closed with both hands, and Allie rolled down the window. She could see the muscles in his arms, the easy smile, the tanned face. She reached out her hand and Noah took it for just a moment, moving his fingers softly against her skin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I love you, too."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Stay with me," Noah mouthed without sound, and this for some reason hurt more than Allie would have expected. The tears began to fall hard now, but she couldn't speak. Finally, reluctantly, she looked away and pulled her hand from his. She put the car in gear and eased the pedal down just a bit. If she didn't leave now, she never would. Noah backed up just a bit as the car started to roll away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He fell into an almost trancelike state as he felt the reality of the situation. He watched the car roll slowly forward; he heard the gravel crunching under the wheels. Slowly the car began to turn from him, toward the road that would take her back to town. Leaving -- she was leaving!-- and Noah felt dizzy at the sight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Edging forward… past him now…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She waved one last time without smiling before she began to accelerate, and he waved back weakly. "Don't go!" he wanted to shout as the car moved farther away. But he didn't say anything, and a minute later the car was gone and the only remaining signs of her were the tracks that her car had left behind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He stood there without moving for a long time. As quickly as she had come, she was gone. Forever this time. Forever.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But, like her mother, he realized sadly, she never looked back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He closed his eyes then and watched her leave once more, her car moving steadily away from him, taking his heart with her.</div>
