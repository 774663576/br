<div class="line_en">It looked like a good thing: but wait till I tell you. We were down South, in Alabama -- Bill Driscoll and myself -- when this kidnapping idea struck us. It was, as Bill afterward expressed it, "during a moment of temporary mental apparition"; but we didn't find that out till later.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a town down there, as flat as a flannel-cake, and called Summit, of course. It contained inhabitants Of as undeleterious and self-satisfied a class of peasantry as ever clustered around a Maypole.</div>

<div class="line_en">Bill and me had a joint capital of about six hundred dollars, and we needed just two thousand dollars more to pull off a fraudulent town-lot scheme in Western Illinois with. We talked it over on the front steps of the hotel. Philoprogenitiveness, says we, is strong in semi-rural communities; therefore and for other reasons, a kidnapping project ought to do better there than in the radius of newspapers that send reporters out in plain clothes to stir up talk about such things. We knew that Summit couldn't get after us with anything stronger than constables and maybe some lackadaisical bloodhounds and a diatribe or two in the Weekly Farmers' Budget. So, it looked good.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我和比尔想合伙在伊利诺斯西部地区买块黑市地，但我俩总共只有六百来块钱资金，要实现这一计划，少不得还需要两千块钱。我们在旅馆门口的台阶上坐下来商量。我们说，乡村集镇上的居民特别疼爱孩子；因此，再加上另外一些因素，在这里绑票比较容易得手，不像那些附近有报纸出版的地方，出了点事就被派去的记者搅得沸沸扬扬。我们知道，顶峰镇有几名警察，或许还有几条懒狗，案发后《农民周报》也可能登出一两篇文章，然而就凭这么点力量是抓不住我们的。如此看来，是个好买卖。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We selected for our victim the only child of a prominent citizen named Ebenezer Dorset. The father was respectable and tight, a mortgage fancier and a stern, upright collection-plate passer and forecloser. The kid was a boy of ten, with bas-relief freckles, and hair the colour of the cover of the magazine you buy at the news-stand when you want to catch a train. Bill and me figured that Ebenezer would melt down for a ransom of two thousand dollars to a cent. But wait till I tell you.</div>

Rats ate up sixteen of Jimmy Talbot's aunt's speckled hen's eggs. Are there any real Indians in these woods? I want some more gravy. Does the trees moving make the wind blow? We had five puppies. What makes your nose so red, Hank? My father has lots of money. Are the stars hot? I whipped Ed Walker twice, Saturday. I don't like girls. You dassent catch toads unless with a string.

He kept us awake for three hours, jumping up and reaching for his rifle and screeching: "Hist! pard," in mine and Bill's ears, as the fancied crackle of a twig or the rustle of a leaf revealed to his young imagination the stealthy approach of the outlaw band.

<div class="line_en">Just at daybreak, I was awakened by a series of awful screams from Bill. They weren't yells, or howls, or shouts, or whoops, or yalps, such as you'd expect from a manly set of vocal organs -- they were simply indecent, terrifying, humiliating screams, such as women emit when they see ghosts or caterpillars. It's an awful thing to hear a strong, desperate, fat man scream incontinently in a cave at daybreak.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="天刚蒙蒙亮，我被比尔的一阵极其尖利的叫声惊醒。你怎么也想不到一个男性发音器官里竟会发出这样的声音——既不是一阵吼叫，也不是一声长嚎，简直就像女人见了鬼或毛毛虫时发出的那种歇斯底里的、让人害怕的而又难堪的一声声尖叫。一大早，又是在一个山洞里，突然听到一个壮汉如此尖声尖气没命似的叫喊，实在是不舒服。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I jumped up to see what the matter was. Red Chief was sitting on Bill's chest, with one hand twined in Bill's hair. In the other he had the sharp case-knife we used for slicing, bacon; and he was industriously and realistically trying to take Bill's scalp, according to the sentence that had been pronounced upon him the evening before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我翻身起床，看看到底出了什么事。原来是红毛酋长已经骑在比尔的胸口上，一只手揪着比尔的头发，一只手我着我们切肉的快刀，正在为如何执行昨晚对比尔的判决而大伤脑筋，不知怎样才能完成完整地割下他的头皮。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I got the knife away from the kid and made him lie down again. But, from that moment, Bill's spirit was broken. He laid down on his side of the bed, but he never closed an eye again in sleep as long as that boy was with us. I dozed off for a while, but along toward sun-up I remembered that Red Chief had said I was to be burned at the stake at the rising of the sun. I wasn't nervous or afraid; but I sat up and lit my pipe and leaned against a rock.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我一把抢过孩子手中的刀，并强迫他重新躺下。但比尔从此变得丧魂落魄似的，在他的那一侧躺下后，因为有这孩子跟我们在一起，就再也没有敢合眼。我虽然睡了一会儿，在太陽快要出来时却想起了红毛酋长的话，日出时就要被绑在火刑柱上烧死。我倒不感到紧张，也不害怕；不过还是坐了起来，点上烟斗，倚在身后的一块石头上抽烟。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I went up on the peak of the little mountain and ran my eye over the contiguous vicinity. Over toward Summit I expected to see the sturdy yeomanry of the village armed with scythes and pitchforks beating the countryside for the dastardly kidnappers. But what I saw was a peaceful landscape dotted with one man ploughing with a dun mule. Nobody was dragging the creek; no couriers dashed hither and yon, bringing tidings of no news to the distracted parents. There was a sylvan attitude of somnolent sleepiness pervading that section of the external outward surface of Alabama that lay exposed to my view. "Perhaps," says I to myself, "it has not yet been discovered that the wolves have home away the tender lambkin from the fold. Heaven help the wolves!" says I, and I went down the mountain to breakfast.</div>
