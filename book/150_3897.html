<div class="line_en">Of course it was not certain yet that Walter knew the truth, and if he didn't it was better perhaps to leave well alone; but if he did, well, in the end it would be the best thing for all of them. At first she had been, if not satisfied, at least resigned to seeing Charlie only by stealth; but time had increased her passion and for some while now she had been increasingly impatient of the obstacles which prevented them from being always together. He had told her so often that he cursed his position which forced him to be so discreet, the ties which bound him, and the ties which bound her: how marvellous it would have been, he said, if they were both free! She saw his point of view; no one wanted a scandal, and of course it required a good deal of thinking over before you changed the course of your life; but if freedom were thrust upon them, ah, then, how simple everything would be!</div>

<div class="line_en">It was not as though any one would suffer very much. She knew exactly what his relations were with his wife. She was a cold woman and there had been no love between them for years. It was habit that held them together, convenience, and of course the children. It was easier for Charlie than for her: Walter loved her; but after all, he was absorbed in his work; and a man always had his club; he might be upset at first, but he would get over it; there was no reason why he should not marry someone else. Charlie had told her that he could not make out how she came to throw herself away on Walter Fane.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看上去谁也不会从这场变故中损失太多。她早看透了他和他妻子之间的关系。她是个冷漠的女人，这么多年来他们之间根本毫无爱情可言，是长久的习惯、生活上的便利和孩子还把他们留在一起。凯蒂这边要比查理难一点。瓦尔特爱她，不过毕竟他的工作会让他分不开心，况且男人还有俱乐部可去。刚开始他会有点心烦意乱，不久就会挺过来的。谁也说不准他不会再娶个妻子。查理曾纳闷，瓦尔特·费恩用了什么高明手段，叫她甘心把下半辈子交给了他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Walter was a gentleman, she would do him the justice to acknowledge that, and he loved her; he would do the right thing and allow her to divorce him. They had made a mistake and the lucky thing was that they had found it out before it was too late. She made up her mind exactly what she was going to say to him and how she would treat him. She would be kind, smiling, and firm. There was no need for them to quarrel. Later on she would always be glad to see him. She hoped honestly that the two years they had spent together would remain with him as a priceless memory.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="瓦尔特是个绅士，这点她凭良心承认。他还爱她，他一定会显示出他的风度，同意跟她离婚。他们的结合是个错误，幸运的是现在发现还为时不晚。她想好了到时要跟他说的话以及事后两人的关系如何。她将做到平和，微笑，但态度坚定。他们没必要争吵。在此之后她依然乐意和他保持友好的往来。她衷心希望一起度过的两年时光会成为他弥足珍贵的回忆。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She wondered, half smiling, why a little while before she had been terrified at the thought that Walter had caught them. Of course it was startling to see the handle of the door slowly turn. But after all they knew the worst that Walter could do, and they were ready for it. Charlie would feel as great a relief as she that what they both desired more than anything in the world should be thus forced upon them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她奇怪自己刚才还怕瓦尔特看见了他们呢，这会儿脸上居然又笑了起来。门把手慢慢转动那一幕虽然挺吓人，不过瓦尔特能做什么呢？他们不怕他。查理会跟她一起如释重负，他们即将得到这个世界上他们最想要的东西。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don't suppose Dorothy Townsend will mind divorcing Charlie a bit," she thought. "Now the youngest boy is going back to England it will be much nicer for her to be in England too. There's absolutely nothing for her to do in Hong Kong. She'll be able to spend all the holidays with her boys. And then she's got her father and mother in England."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“多萝西·唐生不会在乎跟查理离婚的。”她想，“现在她最小的儿子马上要回英格兰，她跟着一起回去会是个好主意。她在香港一点挂念也没有了。她会跟儿子们一起度假，然后搬到英格兰的父母家里去住。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But through all these day-dreams ran a current of apprehension. It was funny: it was as though the wood and the strings of the orchestra played Arcadian melodies and in the bass the drums, softly but with foreboding, beat a grim tattoo. Sooner or later Walter must come home and her heart beat fast at the thought of meeting him; it was strange that he had gone away that afternoon without saying a word to her. Of course she was not frightened of him; after all what could he do, she repeated to herself; but she could not quite allay her uneasiness. Once more she repeated what she would say to him. What was the good of making a scene? She was very sorry, Heaven knew she didn't want to cause him pain, but she couldn't help it if she didn't love him. It was no good pretending and it was always better to tell the truth. She hoped he wouldn't be unhappy, but they had made a mistake and the only sensible thing was to acknowledge it. She would always think kindly of him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是在这些白日梦浮光掠影般一一闪现的时候，她的心底似乎朦朦胧胧潜藏着忧虑。这种感觉相当古怪，就好像一支管弦乐队在旋律声部由木管与弦乐谱写着牧歌般的田园曲，而鼓组却在低音声部隐约地敲击出不祥的节奏。瓦尔特迟早要回来的，一想到将要跟他碰面她就心跳加速。那天下午他话也没说就离开了，总让她觉得奇怪。她当然不是怕他，他做不出什么来的，她反复这样对自己说。然而心中的不安却很难完全驱散。她把要对付他的话又在心里重申了一遍。吵架将无济于事。她很抱歉，上天知道她不是故意叫他痛苦；她不爱他，对此她无能为力。假装没事儿也将毫无益处，不如直接告诉他真相。她希望他不要太难过，他们已经犯了一个错误，现在唯一明智的做法就是承认它。她会怀着好印象回忆他的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was all very simple and everything could be managed without scandal or ill-feeling. And then she and Charlie could marry. Kitty drew a long sigh. They would be very happy. It was worth going through a certain amount of bother to achieve that. Confusedly, one picture jostling another, she thought of the life they would lead together, of the fun they would have and the little journeys they would take together, the house they would live in, the positions he would rise to and the help she would be to him. He would be very proud of her and she, she adored him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="事情将会变得极其简单，不会有丑闻，结局将皆大欢喜。接着她就和查理完婚。凯蒂长长地舒了一口气。快乐的日子即将来临，此前的担惊受怕是值得的。未来生活的画面一幅幅地呈现在她的脑海里，他们将会四处旅行，将会住进新的房子，他的仕途一帆风顺，而她将会是他得力的贤内助。他以她为荣，他是她的偶像。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Fed up," she repeated aloud, trembling with anger. "Fed up! Fed up!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“受够了。”她大声地重复着，怒火使声音都颤抖了，“受够啦！受够啦！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But even as she said this to herself a sudden gust of fear made the sweat start out in the palms of her hands. And because she was frightened she grew angry with him. If he wanted to make a scene, that was his lookout; he must not be surprised if he got more than he bargained for. She would tell him that she had never cared two pins for him and that not a day had passed since their marriage without her regretting it. He was dull. Oh, how he'd bored her, bored her, bored her! He thought himself so much better than any one else, it was laughable; he had no sense of humour; she hated his supercilious air, his coldness, and his self-control. It was easy to be self-controlled when you were interested in nothing and nobody but yourself. He was repulsive to her. She hated to let him kiss her. What had he to be so conceited about? He danced rottenly, he was a wet blanket at a party, he couldn't play or sing, he couldn't play polo and his tennis was no better than anybody else's. Bridge? Who cared about bridge?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她对自己默念了这些话，然而一阵突如其来的恐惧吓得她手心里冒出了汗。她还是害怕，这让她感到愤怒。要是他愿意闹，那他就要小心了。等他吃不消了可别见怪。她要告诉他，她从来也没关心过他，从他们结婚那天起她就后悔了，天天后悔。他是个老古董，让她厌恶、厌恶、厌恶！他自命天高，谁也比不上他，这太可笑了。他身上没有一点幽默感。她讨厌他孤芳自赏，讨厌他冷漠自制。要是一个人只对自己感兴趣，那自制就太易如反掌了。他令她感到恶心。他的吻让她无比厌恶。他凭什么那么自以为是？他跳舞跳得糟糕透顶，到了晚会上他尽会泼冷水，他既不会弹奏乐器也不会唱歌，他不会打马球，他的网球打得比谁都差。他会玩桥牌？谁稀罕桥牌。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Kitty worked herself up into a towering passion. Let him dare to reproach her. All that had happened was his own fault. She was thankful that he knew the truth at last. She hated him and wished never to see him again. Yes, she was thankful that it was all over. Why couldn't he leave her alone? He had pestered her into marrying him and now she was fed up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯蒂歇斯底里地在心里狂喊。叫他敢来责备她，一切全是他的错。他知道真相了，她谢天谢地。她讨厌他，永远不想再见到他。是的，都结束了，她万分感谢。为什么他不离她远点儿，他缠着她，最终她把自己嫁给了他，现在她受够了。">查看中文翻译</div>
