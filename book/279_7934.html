<div class="line_en">Close upon the hour of noon the whole village was suddenly electrified with the ghastly news. No need of the as yet undreamed–of telegraph; the tale flew from man to man, from group to group, from house to house, with little less than telegraphic speed. Of course the schoolmaster gave holiday for that afternoon; the town would have thought strangely of him if he had not.</div>

<div class="line_en">A gory knife had been found close to the murdered man, and it had been recognized by somebody as belonging to Muff Potter-so the story ran. And it was said that a belated citizen had come upon Potter washing himself in the "branch" about one or two o'clock in the morning, and that Potter had at once sneaked off-suspicious circumstances, especially the washing which was not a habit with Potter. It was also said that the town had been ransacked for this "murderer" (the public are not slow in the matter of sifting evidence and arriving at a verdict), but that he could not be found. Horsemen had departed down all the roads in every direction, and the Sheriff "was confident" that he would be captured before night.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="据传闻，人们在死人的附近发现了一把带血的刀，经人辨认说它是莫夫·波特的。另外，一个晚上赶路的人，在凌晨一两点钟左右碰巧看见波特在小河里冲洗自己，见有人来，他马上溜掉。这确实令人怀疑，尤其是冲洗这件事根本不符合波特的习惯。还有，他们说镇上的人已经开始搜寻这个“杀人犯”了（在细查证据并以此定罪方面，人们从不怠慢），可是却没有找到。骑马的人沿着四面八方的路去追捕他，镇上的司法官“深信”：天黑之前就会逮到他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Poor fellow!" "Poor young fellow!" "This ought to be a lesson to grave robbers!" "Muff Potter'll hang for this if they catch him!" This was the drift of remark; and the minister said, "It was a judgment; His hand is here."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可怜的人呀！”“不幸的年青人呀！”“这对盗墓者来说该是个教训！”“莫夫·波特要是给逮住了，一定会被绞死！”人群中时不时地传出这样的话语。牧师却说：“这是他应得的惩罚。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">All the town was drifting toward the graveyard. Tom's heartbreak vanished and he joined the procession, not because he would not a thousand times rather go anywhere else, but because an awful, unaccountable fascination drew him on. Arrived at the dreadful place, he wormed his small body through the crowd and saw the dismal spectacle. It seemed to him an age since he was there before. Somebody pinched his arm. He turned, and his eyes met Huckleberry's. Then both looked elsewhere at once, and wondered if anybody had noticed anything in their mutual glance. But everybody was talking, and intent upon the grisly spectacle before them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="全镇的人潮水般涌向坟地，汤姆突然不伤心了，也跟在后面。实际上，他很想到别的地方去，但是却被一种可怕的、不可言状的魔力吸引到这里。到了这个可怕的地方后，他矮小的身体在人群中拱来拱去挤到了前场，看见了悲凉的场面。他觉得头一天晚上到这里来过后，好像过了许多年似的。这时有人在他胳膊上拧了一下，他转过身来发现是哈克贝利。他俩目光刚一对视就立即转向别的地方，生怕旁人从中看出什么破绽来。可是大家都在谈话，一心关注的是眼前的这个惨状。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now Tom shivered from head to heel; for his eye fell upon the stolid face of Injun Joe. At this moment the crowd began to sway and struggle, and voices shouted, "It's him! it's him! he's coming himself!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，汤姆的目光落到了印第安·乔的脸上，发现他无动于衷。汤姆从头到尾，吓得直打冷颤。人群开始骚动起来，有人大呼：“就是他！就是他！他自己竟来了！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The crowd fell apart, now, and the Sheriff came through, ostentatiously leading Potter by the arm. The poor fellow's face was haggard, and his eyes showed the fear that was upon him. When he stood before the murdered man, he shook as with a palsy, and he put his face in his hands and burst into tears.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="人群闪开，让出了一条路。司法官揪着波特的胳膊，炫耀似地走过来。这个可怜的家伙脸色憔悴，眼中流露出恐惧的神色。到了死人面前，他像中了风，手捂着脸，突然哭起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then Huckleberry and Tom stood dumb and staring, and heard the stony–hearted liar reel off his serene statement, they expecting every moment that the clear sky would deliver God's lightnings upon his head, and wondering to see how long the stroke was delayed. And when he had finished and still stood alive and whole, their wavering impulse to break their oath and save the poor betrayed prisoner's life faded and vanished away, for plainly this miscreant had sold himself to Satan and it would be fatal to meddle with the property of such a power as that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是哈克贝利和汤姆目瞪口呆地站在那里，听着那个铁石心肠的家伙滔滔不绝对大家编了一通谎言。他俩希望老天有眼，立即当头一雷劈死这个骗子。可是恰恰相反，那个骗子却神气活现，安然无恙。他们原打算把誓言抛到一边，去救那个遭陷害的可怜人，见此情景，却更加犹豫不决了。再加上那个坏蛋一定卖身投靠了魔鬼撒旦，很显然同他们斗无异于螳臂当车，不自量力。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Injun Joe repeated his statement, just as calmly, a few minutes afterward on the inquest, under oath; and the boys, seeing that the lightnings were still withheld, were confirmed in their belief that Joe had sold himself to the devil.

<div class="line_en">Mary said she had been affected much the same way. Sid seemed satisfied. Tom got out of the presence as quick as he plausibly could, and after that he complained of toothache for a week, and tied up his jaws every night. He never knew that Sid lay nightly watching, and frequently slipped the bandage free and then leaned on his elbow listening a good while at a time, and afterward slipped the bandage back to its place again. Tom's distress of mind wore off gradually and the toothache grew irksome and was discarded. If Sid really managed to make anything out of Tom's disjointed mutterings, he kept it to himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽说谋杀案这事，她也有同样的感觉。这下希德才不再问东问西了。汤姆的花言巧语使希德感到满意，随后他就溜之大吉。接下来的一周里，他说得了牙疼病，每天晚上睡觉都把嘴扎起来。可是希德夜里总是盯着他，时常解开他扎嘴的带子，然后侧着身子听上好一阵子，再把带子扎上。这一切，汤姆都被蒙在鼓里，渐渐地汤姆的心情平静了许多，对装牙疼也感到没劲，所以就恢复了常态。即使希德从汤姆夜里的支言片语中理出个头绪来，他自己知道就是了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Every day or two, during this time of sorrow, Tom watched his opportunity and went to the little grated jail–window and smuggled such small comforts through to the "murderer" as he could get hold of. The jail was a trifling little brick den that stood in a marsh at the edge of the village, and no guards were afforded for it; indeed, it was seldom occupied. These offerings greatly helped to ease Tom's conscience.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汤姆一直感到很难过，过一两天，他就把能弄到手的小慰问品送到那个“杀人犯”那里，瞅个机会从小栅栏窗户给递进去。牢房很小，是个砖砌的小屋，位于村边的沼泽地上，没派看守，实际上，这里经常空着。汤姆觉得这样做，心灵上得到很大的宽慰。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It seemed to Tom that his schoolmates never would get done holding inquests on dead cats, and thus keeping his trouble present to his mind. Sid noticed that Tom never was coroner at one of these inquiries, though it had been his habit to take the lead in all new enterprises; he noticed, too, that Tom never acted as a witness-and that was strange; and Sid did not overlook the fact that Tom even showed a marked aversion to these inquests, and always avoided them when he could. Sid marvelled, but said nothing. However, even inquests went out of vogue at last, and ceased to torture Tom's conscience.</div>
