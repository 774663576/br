<div class="line_en">It was the girlfriend hour -- a family tradition. Georgia had devised it years ago -- before there were any kids to care about, or so family legend had it. Every holiday, for one hour, while the men were watching football, the women gathered in the living room to have cocktails and catch up on the news. They all knew that soon enough there would be a Herculean amount of work to do in the kitchen, but for sixty minutes, no one cared.</div>

<div class="line_en">Kate sat on the threadbare arm of the cherry-red sofa that had been the centerpiece of this living room for as long as she could remember. Tully sat cross-legged on the floor at Mom's feet. It was her usual spot on holidays. Tully rarely liked to be too far from the woman she considered the perfect mother. Mom, in Dad's La-Z-Boy, was across from Georgia, who sat on the sofa.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯蒂坐在樱桃红沙发的破扶手上，打从她有记忆以来，这张沙发一直是客厅的重心。塔莉盘腿坐在妈妈腿边的地上，每逢节庆她都会固定坐那个位子，在塔莉眼中，她是最完美的妈妈，所以舍不得离她太远。妈妈坐在安乐椅上，乔治雅阿姨坐在对面的沙发上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Thanksgiving in the Mularkey household was always a spectacle. Aunt Georgia and Uncle Ralph drove over from eastern Washington, bringing enough food with them to feed an entire community. In years past, they'd had their four children with them, but now those kids were adults themselves and sometimes had other families to visit on the holiday. This year, Georgia and Ralph were alone, and looking a little dazed by their situation. Georgia had poured herself a drink before she even bothered saying hello to anyone in the house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="穆勒齐家的感恩节向来热闹非凡。乔治雅阿姨和瑞夫姨丈由华盛顿州东部来访，带来的食物足够喂饱整个小区。以前他们的四个孩子都在身边，但他们长大以后有时必须去配偶老家过节。今年四个孩子都没有回来，这样的状况让阿姨和姨丈有些迷惘失措，阿姨一进门还没打招呼便先倒了一杯酒。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You should see what I got to do this week," Tully said, rising to her knees in her excitement. Kate couldn't help noticing that she looked like a supplicant, waiting for Mom's blessing. "You know the Spokane rapist case? Well," she said dramatically, luring them in, "the guy they arrested? His mother hired someone to kill the judge and prosecutor. Can you believe it? And Johnny -- that's my boss -- he let me do a first draft of the copy. They even used a sentence I wrote. It was so cool. Next week he's letting me tag along to an interview with a guy who invented some new kind of computer."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你们绝对不敢相信这个星期我有多好运。”塔莉兴奋地跪起身，凯蒂不禁觉得她像个信徒，等候妈妈的赐福。“你们知道斯波肯之狼吧？听好啰。”她以戏剧化的语气吸引她们的注意，“他妈妈买凶暗杀法官和检察官，很扯吧？我老板强尼让我写那篇报道的草稿，甚至采用了我写的一个句子，酷毙了。下星期要访问一个发明新计算机的人，他答应让我跟去。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was funny how an album, or even just a song, could remind you of so many moments in your life. Kate didn't think there had ever been any family event -- Christmas, Thanksgiving, Easter, the yearly camping trip -- that had been Elvis-free. It just wasn't a Mularkey family moment without him. Mom and Georgia made sure of that. His death hadn't changed the tradition at all, but sometimes, if they drank enough, they'd hug each other and cry for the loss of him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="多么奇妙，一张唱片，甚至是一首歌，就能勾起那么多回忆。在凯蒂的印象中，所有家庭活动都少不了猫王，圣诞节、感恩节、复活节，甚至年度露营，没有他就不是穆勒齐家的欢聚时刻了。妈妈和乔治雅阿姨绝不会忘记他，即使他过世了这个传统也不曾动摇，但她们喝醉的时候会抱在一起哭着悼念。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This year, for the first time ever, Mom had poured glasses of white wine for Kate and Tully. It made Kate feel very grown up to sit here on the arm of the sofa, sipping her wine. Already the first Christmas album of the year was on the turntable. Elvis, naturally, singing about the little boy in the ghetto.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="今年妈妈第一次帮凯蒂和塔莉倒了白酒。凯蒂坐在沙发扶手上啜着酒，感觉自己真的是大人了。今年第一张圣诞专辑已经放上了唱盘，可想而知绝对是猫王，他正唱着贫民窟小男孩的故事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“不只是我，穆勒齐伯母，”塔莉说，“凯蒂也会成功。我一定能帮她争取到实习机会，等着瞧吧，我已经开始放话暗示了。迟早有一天你会在电视上看到我们两个，第一对在联播网主持新闻节目的女性双主播。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Kate sighed. Once again she'd lost her chance. Getting up, she walked across the room, past the corner where soon the Christmas tree would be placed, and stood at the window, looking out over the pasture. A blanket of glittery white coated the field, created sparkly mounds on the fence posts. Moonlight turned everything a beautiful frosty blue and white; with the black velvet sky, it looked like a greeting card. As a girl, she'd waited impatiently for this unexpected weather, prayed for it for months, and no wonder. Covered in snow, Firefly Lane looked like something out of a fairy tale. The kind of place where nothing could ever go wrong, where a girl should be able to simply tell her family that she'd changed her mind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯蒂叹息，又错过了一次好机会。她站起来走向客厅另一头，角落的空间很快会摆上圣诞树，她站在窗前望着外面的牧草地。晶莹白雪笼罩大地，篱笆柱子上也堆着尖尖一层；朦胧月光下，万物蒙上一层美丽的霜蓝与洁白，衬着黑丝绒般的天空，画面有如圣诞卡。小时候，她总是迫不及待地希望赶紧下雪，甚至连续好几个月诚心祈求。白雪皑皑的萤火虫巷仿佛童话故事的场景，在那里，一切都顺心如意，就算志向改变了也不会觉得难以告诉家人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The last few months of their senior year were perfection. Although Tully spent more than twenty-five hours a week at the station where she was interning, and Kate spent an equal number of hours working at Starbucks, the new designer coffee shop in the Pike Place Market, they made sure to spend a lot of their weekend time together, playing pool and drinking beer at Goldies or listening to music at the Blue Moon Tavern. Tully spent a lot of her nights at Chad's, but Kate didn't say much about that. Truthfully, she was having too much fun dating to hassle Tully about her choices.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大四最后的几个月完美至极。塔莉每星期花二十五个小时在电视台实习，凯蒂则花同样的时间在星巴克打工，那是“帕克市场”里新开的时髦咖啡店，尽管如此，她们周末的时间总是一起度过，去“歌蒂酒吧”喝酒、打桌球，或者去“蓝月酒馆”听音乐。塔莉晚上大多睡在查德家，但凯蒂没有表示意见，老实说，她自己都为了约会忙得不亦乐乎，没时间去唠叨塔莉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The only problem in Kate's life -- and it was a biggie -- was her upcoming graduation. She was going to graduate next month with honors, with a degree in communications/broadcast journalism, and she still hadn't told anyone that it wasn't her dream job.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“什么样子？”凯蒂拖延时间，心不在焉地听着妈妈描述。妈妈说到垫肩和亮片时，凯蒂鼓起勇气说，“妈，我寄了履历表去‘诺斯庄百货公司’，他们的广告部门在征人。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Kate tried to put her indecision into words. She just didn't know what she wanted to do with the rest of her life. She believed there had to be something special out there for her, a path that was hers alone and held happiness at its end, but where was the start of it? "I'm not like Tully," she finally said, admitting the truth she'd known for a long time. "I don't eat, sleep, and breathe the news. Sure, I'm good enough to get all A's and my profs love me because I'm never late with an assignment, but journalism -- TV or print -- is a jungle.
