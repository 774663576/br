<div class="line_cn" title="那天是个阴沉的秋日，吉尔；波尔在体育馆后面哭泣。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She was crying because they had been bullying her. This is not going to be a school story, so I shall say as little as possible about Jill's school, which is not a pleasant subject. It was "Co-educational," a school for both boys and girls, what used to be called a "mixed" school; some said it was not nearly so mixed as the minds of the people who ran it. These people had the idea that boys and girls should be allowed to do what they liked.</div>

<div class="line_en">And unfortunately what ten or fifteen of the biggest boys and girls liked best was bullying the others. All sorts of things, horrid things, went on which at an ordinary school would have been found out and stopped in half a term; but at this school they weren't. Or even if they were, the people who did them were not expelled or punished. The Head said they were interesting psychological cases and sent for them and talked to them for hours. And if you knew the right sort of things to say to the Head, the main result was that you became rather a favourite than otherwise.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不幸的是有那么十个到十五个大龄男女生最喜欢干的就是欺侮同学。各种各样的事，各种各样可怕的事，要出在一所普通学校里，不消半学期就会查出来，加以制止，可在这所学校里却没这么办。或者，即使这些事被查出了，干这些事的人也没被开除或受处分。校长说他们是些有趣的心理学方面的实例，派人去找他们，跟他们谈上几个小时。如果你懂得跟校长说些投合他心意的话，其结果是你就此成了个宠儿。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That was why Jill Pole was crying on that dull autumn day on the damp little path which runs between the back of the gym and the shrubbery. And she hadn't nearly finished her cry when a boy came round the corner of the gym whistling, with his hands in his pockets. He nearly ran into her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这就是吉尔；波尔在那个阴沉的秋日，在体育馆后面和灌木丛之间那条湿漉漉的小路上哭的原因。她还没哭完，就有一个男生双手插在口袋里，绕过体育馆墙角，吹着口哨走来几乎撞上了她。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"If only the door was open again!" said Scrubb as they went on, and Jill nodded. For at the top of the shrubbery was a high stone wall and in that wall a door by which you could get out on to open moor. This door was nearly always locked. But there had been times when people had found it open; or perhaps there had been only one time. But you may imagine how the memory of even one time kept people hoping, and trying the door; for if it should happen to be unlocked it would be a splendid way of getting outside the school grounds without being seen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“只要那扇门再开开就好了I”他们一路爬着，斯克罗布说，吉尔点点头。因为灌木丛上方有一道高高的石墙，墙上有扇门，穿过这扇门你就可以出去，到开阔的荒野去。这扇门几乎老是锁着。不过人们有时也发现门开着；也许只有过那么一次。不过你可以想像，即使记得只有一次，也就让人们抱有希望，打算试试那扇门；因为要是那扇门正巧没锁，那倒是一个神不知鬼不觉走出校园的绝妙办法。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jill and Eustace, now both very hot and very grubby from going along bent almost double under the laurels, panted up to the wall. And there was the door, shut as usual.</div>

<div class="line_en">They had expected to see the grey, heathery slope of the moor going up and up to join the dull autumn sky. Instead, a blaze of sunshine met them. It poured through the doorway as the light of a June day pours into a garage when you open the door. It made the drops of water on the grass glitter like beads and showed up the dirtiness of Jill's tear-stained face. And the sunlight was coming from what certainly did look like a different world -- what they could see of it. They saw smooth turf, smoother and brighter than Jill had ever seen before, and blue sky, and, darting to and fro, things so bright that they might have been jewels or huge butterflies.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们原以为会看见荒原上灰不溜秋、长满石南的山坡越来越高，一直通向阴沉沉的秋日的天空，没料到迎面却看见了一片强烈的阳光。阳光照进门口，就像你打开汽车间门，六月里大白天的太阳照进来一样。阳光照得草地上的水珠像珍珠一样闪闪发亮，也使吉尔满是泪痕的脸显得一副脏相。而且据他们判断这阳光一定来自一个不同的世界。他们看见柔嫩的草地，比吉尔以前所见过的更柔嫩，更明亮，还有蓝蓝的天，还有一些发亮的东西在空中飞来飞去，很可能是珠宝或是大蝴蝶。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The sound of Edith Jackle's voice stopped as suddenly as the voice on the radio when it is switched off. Instantly there was a quite different sound all about them. It came from those bright things overhead, which now turned out to be birds. They were making a riotous noise, but it was much more like music -- rather advanced music which you don't quite take in at the first hearing -- than birds' songs ever are in our world. Yet, in spite of the singing, there was a sort of background of immense silence. That silence, combined with the freshness of the air, made Jill think they must be on the top of a very high mountain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伊迪丝；杰克尔的声音突然没了，正如你一关上收音机，里面的声音就突然消失一样。他们周围顿时响起一种完全不同的声音。声音是从他们头顶上那些发亮的东西发出来的，他们马上看出原来是鸟。它们正发出喧闹的声音，不过这种声音比起我们世界里鸟儿的歌声更像音乐——相当先进的音乐，乍一听你还不大领会得了。然而，尽管有歌声，背景却是无比寂静。那份寂静，加上空气新鲜，使吉尔想到他们一定是在一座很高的山顶上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Scrubb still had her by the hand and they were walking forward, staring about them on every side. Jill saw that huge trees, rather like cedars but bigger, grew in every direction. But as they did not grow close together, and as there was no undergrowth, this did not prevent one from seeing a long way into the forest to left and right. And as far as Jill's eye could reach, it was all the same -- level turf, darting birds with yellow, or dragonfly blue, or rainbow plumage, blue shadows, and emptiness. There was not a breath of wind in that cool, bright air. It was a very lonely forest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯克罗布仍然拉着她的手，他们向前走着，一面朝四周张望。吉尔看见四面八方都长着那种参天大树，很像雪松，但更大些口不过这些树木长得并不密，树下也没有矮树丛，无遮无拦，树林左右老远老远都看得清。吉尔放眼望去，看到的景色全是一样的——平坦的草地，五颜六色的鸟儿飞来飞去，有黄的，有蜻蜓蓝的，有彩虹色的，蓝森森的阴影，一片空荡荡。那凉爽清新的空气中连一丝风也没有。真是一座非常冷清的森林。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Right ahead there were no trees: only blue sky. They went straight on without speaking till suddenly Jill heard Scrubb say, "Look out!" and felt herself jerked back. They were at the very edge of a cliff.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正前方那边没有树木，只有蓝天。他们一言不发，笔直地朝前走，走啊走的，突然间吉尔听见斯克罗布说“小心！”接着就觉得自己猛地朝后收住脚步。他们正站在悬崖边上呢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jill was one of those lucky people who have a good head for heights. She didn't mind in the least standing on the edge of a precipice. She was rather annoyed with Scrubb for pulling her back -- "just as if I was a kid", she said and she wrenched her hand out of his. When she saw how very white he had turned, she despised him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="碰巧吉尔对高地很有头脑。站在悬崖边上，她竟毫不在意。她对斯克罗布把她拉回来相当恼火——“就当我是个小娃娃似的。”她说——说着猛地挣脱了他的手。她看见他脸色变得非常苍白，就瞧不起他了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What's the matter?" she said. And to show that she was not afraid, she stood very near the edge indeed; in fact, a good deal nearer than even she liked. Then she looked down.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“怎么啦？”她说。接着为了显示她并不害怕，居然真的站得离悬崖边很近；事实上，比她心里想站的地方近多了。然后她朝下面望望。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She now realized that Scrubb had some excuse for looking white, for no cliff in our world is to be compared with this. Imagine yourself at the top of the very highest cliff you know. And imagine yourself looking down to the very bottom. And then imagine that the precipice goes on below that, as far again, ten times as far, twenty times as far. And when you've looked down all that distance imagine little white things that might, at first glance, be mistaken for sheep, but presently you realize that they are clouds -- not little wreaths of mist but the enormous white, puffy clouds which are themselves as big as most mountains. And at last, in between those clouds, you get your first glimpse of the real bottom, so far away that you can't make out whether it's field or wood, or land or water: farther below those clouds than you are above them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如今她才明白斯克罗布脸色发白是有道理的，因为在我们世界里没有一座悬崖能与这座相比。想像一下你自己站在据你所知是最高的一座悬崖顶上。再想像一下你自己正朝崖底看。再想像一下悬崖继续一直往下，往下，十倍于此，二十倍于此。而当你朝那么远的下面看去，第一眼你可能在想像中把那些小白点错认为羊群吧，但不久你就知道那是白云——不是雾气形成的小云卷，而是又大又白，蓬蓬松松的云层，一片片大得像群山一样。透过这些云层之间，你才终于第一眼看到了那真正的崖底，那么远，那么远，远得你都看不出下面究竟是田野还是树林，是陆地还是水面。你在崖顶上离云层上面还不算远，崖底离云层下面更远。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jill stared at it. Then she thought that perhaps, after all, she would step back afoot or so from the edge; but she didn't like to for fear of what Scrubb would think. Then she suddenly decided that she didn't care what he thought, and that she would jolly well get away from that horrible edge and never laugh at anyone for not liking heights again. But when she tried to move, she found she couldn't. Her legs seemed to have turned into putty. Everything was swimming before her eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔目不转睛地望着下面。她这才想到也许自己毕竟该从悬崖边上往后退一两步的，可她生怕斯克罗布会怎么想，又不愿退。后来她突然决定，不管他怎么想，她巴不得赶快离开这可怕的崖边，再也不取笑任何不喜欢高地的人了。但等到她想动弹的时候，却发现自己动不了啦。她两条腿似乎都被捆住了口眼前一切都在旋转。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What are you doing, Pole? Come back-blithering little idiot!" shouted Scrubb. But his voice seemed to he coming from a long way off. She felt him grabbing at her. But by now she had no control over her own arms and legs. There was a moment's struggling on the cliff edge. Jill was too frightened and dizzy to know quite what she was doing, but two things she remembered as long as she lived (they often came back to her in dreams). One was that she had wrenched herself free of Scrubb's clutches; the other was that, at the same moment, Scrubb himself, with a terrified scream, had lost his balance and gone hurtling to the depths.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你在干什么呀，波尔？回来——头号小傻瓜I”斯克罗布大声喊道。可他的声音似乎来自很远很远的地方。她感到他在拉她。可这会儿她已经控制不了自己的手脚。在悬崖边上挣扎了一会儿。吉尔心里太害怕了，头太晕了，都不大记得自己干了什么，不过有两件事是她这辈子都忘不了的（她还经常梦见这两件事呢）。一件是她挣脱了斯克罗布的手；另一件事是与此同时，斯克罗布本人惊恐地尖叫一声，失去平衡，一头滚下深渊。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Fortunately, she was given no time to think over what she had done. Some huge, brightly coloured animal had rushed to the edge of the cliff. It was lying down, leaning over, and (this was the odd thing) blowing. Not roaring or snorting, but just blowing from its wide-opened mouth; blowing out as steadily as a vacuum cleaner sucks in. Jill was lying so close to the creature that she could feel the breath vibrating steadily through its body. She was lying still because she couldn't get up. She was nearly fainting: indeed, she wished she could really faint, but faints don't come for the asking. At last she saw, far away below her, a tiny black speck floating away from the cliff and slightly upwards. As it rose, it also got farther away. By the time it was nearly on a level with the cliff-top it was so far off that she lost sight of it. It was obviously moving away from them at a great speed. Jill couldn't help thinking that the creature at her side was blowing it away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="幸亏她还来不及想想自己干了些什么。一只颜色鲜艳的巨兽已经冲到悬崖边上。它躺下，探出身子，吹着气（这可真是怪事）。不是怒吼，也不是喷鼻息，而是张大嘴巴吹气；悠悠地不断吹啊吹啊，就像吸尘器在吸一样。吉尔躺着的地方离这只动物那么近，都感觉得到这股气在它身体里沉稳的震动。她躺着一动不动是因为起不来口她差点晕过去了：其实，她但愿自己真的晕过去，不过不是想晕倒就能晕倒的。后来她终于看见了，在她下面很远的地方，一个小黑点正从悬崖飘开，而且稍微往上飘了一点。黑点一升起，就飘远了。等到黑点升到和悬崖差不多高的时候，已经飘得远远的，她就此看不见了。显然这个黑点已飞快地离开了他们。吉尔不禁认为就是她身边这动物把那个黑点吹走的。">查看中文翻译</div>
