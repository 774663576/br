There's not even a proper motif, as far as Ove can see, just a lot of patterns. Is that something an adult person in a healthy state of mind would consent to? Going about with his arms looking like a pair of pajamas?</div>

<div class="line_en">For the last twenty years practically every human being he's met has done nothing but drone on at Ove about how he should be paying for everything by card.

<div class="line_en">But his wife insisted on getting hold of one of those prepaid cards in spite of it all, even though Ove warned her against it. And when she died the bank simply sent Ove a new card in his name, connected to her account. And now, after he's been buying flowers for her grave for the past six months, there's a sum of 136 kronor and 54 öre left on it. And Ove knows very well that this money will disappear into the pocket of some bank director if Ove dies without spending it first.</div>

<div class="line_en">He had gone out this morning long before the sun had drummed up the energy to rise over the horizon, much less any of his neighbors. He had carefully studied the train timetable in the hall. Then he'd turned out the lights, switched off the radiators, locked his front door, and left the envelope with all the instructions on the hall mat inside the door. He assumed that someone would find it when they came to take the house.</div>

<div class="line_en">He fetched the snow shovel, cleared the snow away from the front of the house, put the shovel back in the shed. Locked the shed. Had Ove been a bit more attentive he would have noticed the fairly large cat-shaped cavity in the quite large snowdrift just outside his shed as he started heading off towards the parking area. But because he had more important things on his mind he did not.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他拿雪铲铲掉了家门口的雪，把铲子放回储藏室，锁好储藏室的门。要是更仔细一些，往停车场走的时候，他很可能会注意到，储藏室门口挺大的一堆积雪上有个挺大的猫形窟窿。但他现在有更重要的事情要做，所以他没有留意。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He checked the train timetable once more. He hated being late. It ruined the planning. Made everything out of step. His wife had been utterly useless at it, keeping to plans. But it was always like that with women. They couldn't stick to a plan even if you glued them to it, Ove had learned. When he was driving somewhere he drew up schedules and plans and decided where they'd fill up and when they'd stop for coffee, all in the interest of making the trip as time-efficient as possible. He studied maps and estimated exactly how long each leg of the journey would take and how they should avoid rush-hour traffic and the shortcuts to take that people with GPS systems wouldn't be able to make head nor tail of. Ove always had a clear travel strategy. His wife, on the other hand, always came up with insanities like "going by a sense of feel" and "taking it easy." As if that was a way for an adult person to get anywhere in life. And then she always remembered that she had to make a call or had forgotten some scarf or other. Or she didn't know which coat to pack at the last moment. Or something else. She always forgot the thermos of coffee on the draining board, which was actually the only important thing. There were four coats in those damned bags but no coffee. As if one could just turn off into a gas station every hour and buy the burned fox piss they were selling in there. And get even more delayed. And when Ove got disgruntled she always had to challenge the importance of having a time plan when driving somewhere. "We're not in a hurry anyway," she'd say. As if that had anything to do with it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他又检查了一遍火车时刻表。他讨厌迟到。这样会打乱整个计划，之后就会乱套。在遵守计划这方面，他的太太一窍不通，但这是女人的专利。哪怕把她们和计划粘在一块儿，她们也跟不上，这是生活教给欧维的。假如要出远门，他会规划行程定时间表，根据时间效率决定在哪里加油、在哪里喝咖啡。他研究地图，精确估算出每一步需要花的时间，以及如何避开高峰车流，走那些用GPS的人不可能发现的捷径。欧维总是有一套清晰的旅行策略，但他的太太恰恰相反，总是说什么“跟着感觉走”和“悠着点儿”之类的疯话，就好像作为一个成年人，这样就能过日子了。她总是会突然要打个电话或者忘了一条围巾，或者最后一刻还无法决定要打包哪件大衣。非此即彼不一而足。然后她总是把装咖啡的保温杯忘在厨房操作台上，那可是“唯一”重要的东西。该死的行李箱里装了四件大衣，但是没有咖啡，就好像每小时可以随意找个加油站买那里提供的滚烫狐狸尿，于是就会迟到更久。每次欧维生气的时候，她总会问，可以自驾，时间表为什么还那么重要。“反正我们又不着急。”她说，就好像这跟此事有任何关系似的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Chastened by recent experiences, he did not take the Saab, but walked instead to the station. Because this time neither Pregnant Foreign Woman, Blond Weed, Rune's wife, nor low-quality rope would be given any opportunity of ruining Ove's morning. He'd bled these people's radiators, loaned them his things, given them lifts to the hospital. But now he was finally on his way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="出于事与愿违的经验，他没有开萨博，而是步行去的火车站。这次不管外国孕妇、金发霉女、鲁尼的夫人还是质量不过关的绳子，都休想打扰欧维的早晨。他为这些人的暖气通风，借给他们自己的东西，送他们去医院。他已经受够了。这下欧维终于可以上路了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Now, standing at the station platform, he presses his hands into his pockets. He isn't wearing his suit jacket. It's much too stained and smells too strongly of car exhaust, so he feels she'd probably have a crack at him if he were to turn up in that. She doesn't like the shirt and sweater he's wearing now, but at least they're clean and in decent condition. It's about ten degrees outside. He hasn't yet changed the blue autumn jacket for the blue winter coat, and the cold is blowing straight through it. He's been a bit distracted of late, he has to admit. He hasn't given any real thought to how one is supposed to present oneself when arriving upstairs. Initially he thought one should be all spruced up and formal. Most likely there'll be some kind of uniform up there, to avoid confusion. He supposes there will be all sorts of people -- foreigners, for instance, each one wearing a stranger outfit than the next. Presumably it will be possible to organize your clothes once you get there -- surely there will even be some sort of wardrobe department?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他站在站台上，把手往口袋里一插。他没有穿那套西装。太脏了，而且全是汽油味，要是他穿着那身出现，她又要大嗓门了。他也不喜欢现在穿的这身衬衣和毛衣，但至少是干净的。气温接近零下十五摄氏度。他还没有把那件蓝色秋装换成蓝色冬装，寒气直接穿透进来。最近他确实有些心不在焉，这他承认。他没怎么考虑过该打扮成什么样子上天。他原来一直以为应该衣冠楚楚地走。但仔细想想，他觉得，往生后，为避免混淆，应该有制服。什么样的人都会死，这谁都知道。外国人什么的，穿得一个比一个古怪。所以得有人管管这事，那儿一定有个什么服装部。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The platform is almost empty. On the other side of the track are some sleepy-looking youths with oversize backpacks which, Ove decides, are most likely filled with drugs. Alongside them is a man in his forties in a gray suit and a black overcoat. He's reading the newspaper. A little farther off are some small-talking women in their best years with county council logos on their chests and purple tresses of hair. They're chain-smoking long menthol cigarettes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="站台上几乎没有人。对面站台站着个睡眼惺忪的年轻人，背硕大的背包，欧维认为里面装的肯定都是毒品。他身边不远处，站着个四十岁左右穿灰色西装套黑色大衣的男人，正在读报。更远处，有几个妙龄女子正在攀谈，胸口都戴着郡徽，头发挑染成紫色，轮番抽着一根超长的薄荷烟。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On Ove's side of the track it's empty but for three overdimensioned municipal employees in their midthirties in workmen's trousers and hard hats, standing in a ring and staring down into a hole. Around them is a carelessly erected loop of cordon tape. One of them has a mug of coffee from 7-Eleven; another is eating a banana; the third is trying to poke his cell phone without removing his gloves. It's not going so well. And the hole stays where it is. And still we're surprised when the whole world comes crashing down in a financial crisis, Ove thinks. When people do little more than standing around eating bananas and looking into holes in the ground all day.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维这边的站台没有乘客，只有三个超重的工作人员，三十五岁左右，穿着工作裤，戴着安全帽，围成一个圈，低头瞪着个窟窿。他们周围凌乱地挂着几条橙色的路障带。其中一人手里拿着一杯7—11的咖啡，另一个人站在那儿吃香蕉，第三个人正试着用戴着手套的手按手机，不太成功。窟窿还在原地。全世界陷入经济危机不是迟早的事儿吗，欧维想。现在，人们只会一边吃香蕉一边往地上的窟窿里看上一整天。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He checks his watch. One minute left. He stands at the edge of the platform. Balancing the soles of his shoes over the edge. It's a fall of no more than five feet, he estimates. Five and a half, possibly. There's a certain symbolism in a train taking his life and he doesn't like this much. He doesn't think the train driver should have to see the awfulness of it. For this reason he has decided to jump when the train is very close, so it's rather the side of the first carriage that throws him onto the rails than the big windshield at the front. He looks in the direction the train is coming from and slowly starts counting. It's important that the timing is absolutely right, he determines. The sun is just up; it shines obstinately into his eyes like a child who has just been given a flashlight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他看看表，还剩一分钟。他迈步走到站台边，鞋底压着边缘。站台上下，他目测高差不到一米半。一米六，大概。对他来说，丧命于车轮下有些象征意义，但他并不喜欢这种方式。他不喜欢列车司机目睹惨剧，所以他决定等火车非常近了再跳，这样把他撞下铁轨的就是第一节车厢的边缘，而不是正面的大玻璃窗。他瞪着火车的方向开始计算。准确的时间点非常重要，他心想。太阳正缓缓升起，倔强地照进他的眼睛里，好似刚拿到一柄手电的孩子。">查看中文翻译</div>

It continues for a second or so, then the suit-wearing man looks up blindly and his whole body is struck with some form of nervous twitching. His arms shake convulsively. And then, as if the moment is a long sequence of still photographs, the newspaper falls out of his hands and he passes out, falling off the edge onto the track with a thump, as if he were a sack of cement mixture.</div>

Ove hoists up the suit-wearing man in a way that men who have never put their foot in a gym yet have spent their entire lives carrying a concrete plinth under each arm tend to be able to do. He heaves up the body into the backpacker's arms in a way that Audi-driving men wearing neon-bright jogging pants are often incapable of doing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“真他妈倒霉。”最后欧维自言自语道。然后他就跳下了铁道。“过来拉一把！”他朝站台边的长发背包客喊。背包客慢慢朝边缘挪。欧维举起那个西装男，那身手只有那些从来没去过健身房却一辈子整天双臂各夹两砣混凝土块的人才能做得到。那动作，一般开奥迪、买彩色紧身运动衣穿的年轻人是做不出来的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ove stares into the puppy's face. Clenches his fists in his pockets as if he's cursing himself for what he's about to do. But it can't be helped, he thinks. There's a right way of doing things. And a wrong way.</div>

<div class="line_en">To Ove, the moments that follow are elongated as if time itself has applied its brakes and made everything around him travel in slow motion. The explosion of sounds is muted into a low hiss in his ears, the train approaching so slowly that it's as if it's being pulled along by two decrepit oxen. The headlights flash despairingly at him. And in the interval between two of the flashes, while he isn't blinded, he finds himself establishing eye contact with the train driver. He can't be more than twenty years old. One of those who still gets called "the puppy" by his older colleagues.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="下一刻，欧维感觉时间像刹了车似的被拉长，周围的一切都因此在慢动作中进行。巨响在他耳朵里化成一片呢喃，火车慢慢靠近他，就像拉车的是两头老黄牛，绝望地用车头灯照着他。欧维直视着灯光，他并没有被强光迷了眼，就在两束光之间，他居然捕捉到了列车司机的视线。他肯定不到二十岁，还是同事们依然叫他狗仔的年纪。">查看中文翻译</div>
