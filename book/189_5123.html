<div class="line_en">It was late next morning when Oliver awoke, from a sound, long sleep. There was no other person in the room but the old Jew, who was boiling some coffee in a saucepan for breakfast, and whistling softly to himself as he stirred it round and round, with an iron spoon. He would stop every now and then to listen when there was the least noise below: and when he had satistified himself, he would go on whistling and stirring again, as before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天上午，奥立弗从酣然沉睡中醒来，天已经不早了。屋子里没有别的人，犹太老头正在用一口耳锅煮早餐的咖啡。他匀匀缓缓地用铁匙搅动着咖啡，一边悠闲地打着口哨。时不时地，只要楼下有响动，他便要停下来听一听，直待放心了，才又继续在口哨的伴奏下，像刚才一样搅拌咖啡。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Although Oliver had roused himself from sleep, he was not thoroughly awake. There is a drowsy state, between sleeping and waking, when you dream more in five minutes with your eyes half open, and yourself half conscious of everything that is passing around you, than you would in five nights with your eyes fast closed, and your senses wrapt in perfect unconsciousness. At such time, a mortal knows just enough of what his mind is doing, to form some glimmering conception of its mighty powers, its bounding from earth and spurning time and space, when freed from the restraint of its corporeal associate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="奥立弗已经醒了，却还没有完全清醒过来。一般说来，在沉睡和清醒中间存在着一种困盹恍惚的状态，眼睛半睁半闭，对周围发生的事情似醒非醒，在短短五分钟里梦见的东西比起五个晚上紧闭双眼，对一切浑然不觉中所梦见的还要多。在这种时候，人对于自己的内心活动理应十分明了，并且对于它的巨大威力形成某种模糊的意识，它一旦从肉体躯壳的桎桔中挣脱出来便可以超脱尘世，不受时间、空间的限制。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When the coffee was done, the Jew drew the saucepan to the hob. Standing, then in an irresolute attitude for a few minutes, as if he did not well know how to employ himself, he turned round and looked at Oliver, and called him by his name. He did not answer, and was to all appearances asleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="咖啡煮好了，费金把锅放到炉台上，站在那里，犹豫了一会儿，像是不知如何是好的样子。接着他转过身来望着奥立弗，叫了几声他的名字，他没有回答，叫谁看了都会以为他还在睡觉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Oliver was precisely in this condition. He saw the Jew with his half-closed eyes; heard his low whistling; and recognised the sound of the spoon grating against the saucepan's sides: and yet the self-same senses were mentally engaged, at the same time, in busy action with almost everybody he had ever known.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="奥立弗恰好处于这么一种状态。他睡眼朦胧地望着费金，听他低声吹着口哨，连汤匙碰撞锅边的响声都能辨别。与此同时，在他的内心，同样的感觉却与他认识的几乎每一个人都产生了无数的联想。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Aha!" said the Jew, shrugging up his shoulders, and distorting every feature with a hideous grin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊哈。”费金耸了耸肩，令人恶心地咧着嘴笑起来，把脸整个扭歪了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After satisfying himself upon this head, the Jew stepped gently to the door: which he fastened. He then drew forth: as it seemed to Oliver, from some trap in the floor: a small box, which he placed carefully on the table. His eyes glistened as he raised the lid, and looked in. Dragging an old chair to the table, he sat down; and took from it a magnificent gold watch, sparkling with jewels.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="费金心里踏实了，他轻手轻脚地走到门边，把门锁上。接着，奥立弗感觉他好像是从地板上某个暗处抽出一个小盒子，小心翼翼地放在桌上。他打开盒盖，朝里边看去，眼睛里闪出了光彩。他把一张旧椅子扯到桌前，坐下来，从盒子里取出一只贵重的金表，上边的珠宝钻石亮光闪闪。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">With these, and other muttered reflections of the like nature, the Jew once more deposited the watch in its place of safety. At least half a dozen more were severally drawn forth from the same box, and surveyed with equal pleasure; besides rings, brooches, bracelets, and other articles of jewellery, of such magnificent materials, and costly workmanship, that Oliver had no idea, even of their names.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="费金这样那样叽哩咕噜地念叨着，骨子里说的都是一回事，他重新把表放回原处，又接连从盒子里拿出至少半打别的东西，以同样的兴趣观赏着，除了戒指、胸针、手镯，还有几样珠宝首饰质地考究，做工精细，奥立弗连名字也叫不出来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Having replaced these trinkets, the Jew took out another: so small that it lay in the palm of his hand. There seemed to be some very minute inscription on it; for the Jew laid it flat upon the table, and shading it with his hand, pored over it, long and earnestly. At length he put it down, as if despairing of success; and, leaning back in his chair, muttered:</div>

<div class="line_en">He closed the lid of the box with a loud crash; and, laying his hand on a bread knife which was on the table, started furiously up. He trembled very much though; for, even in his terror, Oliver could see that the knife quivered in the air.</div>

<div class="line_en">As the Jew uttered these words, his bright dark eyes, which had been staring vacantly before him, fell on Oliver's face; the boy's eyes were fixed on his in mute curiousity; and although the recognition was only for an instant -- for the briefest space of time that can possibly be conceived -- it was enough to show the old man that he had been observed.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Tush, tush, my dear!" said the Jew, abruptly resuming his old manner, and playing with the knife a little, before he laid it down; as if to induce the belief that he had caught it up, in mere sport. "Of course I know that, my dear. I only tried to frighten you. You're a brave boy. Ha! ha! you're a brave boy, Oliver." The Jew rubbed his hands with a chuckle, but glanced uneasily at the box, notwithstanding.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啐，啐，我亲爱的。”费金骤然恢复了常态，把切刀拿在手里晃了几下，放回桌子上，似乎想借此表明他拿起刀来不过是玩玩。“亲爱的，我当然有数罗，我只是想吓唬吓唬你。你胆子不小，哈哈！胆子不小啊，奥立弗。”犹太人嘻嘻一笑，搓了搓手，眼睛却依然不很放心地朝那只盒子看了一眼。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He had scarcely washed himself, and made everything tidy, by emptying the basin out of the window, agreeably to the Jew's directions, when the Dodger returned: accompanied by a very sprightly young friend, whom Oliver had seen smoking on the previous night, and who was now formally introduced to him as Charley Bates. The four sat down, to breakfast, on the coffee, and some hot rolls and ham which the Dodger had brought home in the crown of his hat.</div>

<div class="line_en">Oliver thought the old gentleman must be a decided miser to live in such a dirty place, with so many watches; but, thinking that perhaps his fondness for the Dodger and the other boys, cost him a good deal of money, he only cast a deferential look at the Jew, and asked if he might get up.</div>

<div class="line_en">When the breakfast was cleared away; the merry old gentlman and the two boys played at a very curious and uncommon game, which was performed in this way. The merry old gentleman, placing a snuff-box in one pocket of his trousers, a note-case in the other, and a watch in his waistcoat pocket, with a guard-chain round his neck, and sticking a mock diamond pin in his shirt: buttoned his coat tight round him, and putting his spectacle-case and handkerchief in his pockets, trotted up and down the room with a stick, in imitation of the manner in which old gentlemen walk about the streets any hour in the day. Sometimes he stopped at the fire-place, and sometimes at the door, making believe that he was staring with all his might into shop-windows. At such times, he would look constantly round him, for fear of thieves, and would keep slapping all his pockets in turn, to see that he hadn't lost anything, in such a very funny and natural manner, that Oliver laughed till the tears ran down his face. All this time, the two boys followed him closely about: getting out of his sight, so nimbly, every time he turned round, that it was impossible to follow their motions. At last, the Dodger trod upon his toes, or ran upon his boot accidently, while Charley Bates stumbled up against him behind; and in that one moment they took from him, with the most extraordinary rapidity, snuff-box, note-case, watch-guard, chain, shirt-pin, pocket-handkerchief, even the spectacle-case. If the old gentlman felt a hand in any one of his pockets, he cried out where it was; and then the game began all over again.</div>

They wore a good deal of hair, not very neatly turned up behind, and were rather untidy about the shoes and stockings. They were not exactly pretty, perhaps; but they had a great deal of colour in their faces, and looked quite stout and hearty. Being remarkably free and agreeable in their manners, Oliver thought them very nice girls indeed. As there is no doubt they were.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这套游戏翻来覆去做了无数次，这时，有两位小姐前来看望小绅士们，其中一个叫蓓特，一个叫南希。她们都长着浓密的头发，乱蓬蓬地挽在脑后，鞋袜也颇不整洁。她俩或许并不特别漂亮，可脸上红扑扑的，显得非常丰满、健康。两位姑娘举止洒脱大方，奥立弗觉得她们的确算得上非常出色的姑娘了，这一点倒是毋容置疑的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The visitors stopped a long time. Spirits were produced, in consequence of one of the young ladies complaining of a coldness in her inside; and the conversation took a very convivial and improving turn. At length, Charley Bates expressed his opinion that it was time to pad the hoof. This, it occurred to Oliver, must be French for going out; for directly afterwards, the Dodger, and Charley, and the two young ladies, went away together, having been kindly furnished by the amiable old Jew with money to spend.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两位来客逗留了好一会儿，有一个姑娘抱怨说，她身体里边冷得慌，酒立刻端了出来，谈话转而变得十分欢乐，富有教益。最后，查理贝兹提出，该去遛遛蹄子了。奥立弗猜出这肯定是法语“出去逛一会”的意思，因为紧接着，机灵鬼和查理便与两位女郎一块儿出去了，那位和蔼的老犹太人还体贴地给了他们零花钱。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes," said the Jew; "that is, unless they should unexpectedly come across any, when they are out; and they won't neglect it, if they do, my dear, depend upon it. Make "em your models, my dear. Make "em your models," tapping the fire-shovel on the hearth to add force to his words; "do everything they bid you, and take their advice in all matters -- especially the Dodger's, my dear. He'll be a great man himself, and will make you one too, if you take pattern by him.-- Is my handkerchief hanging out of my pocket, my dear?" said the Jew, stopping short.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对呀，”费金说，“是那么回事，除非他们在外边碰巧找到什么活了。他们才不会白白放过呢，亲爱的，你放心好了。跟他们学着点儿，你得学几招，”他用煤铲在炉子边上敲打着，为的是增加话的分量。“他们要你做什么你就做什么，所有的事都要听他们的指点――尤其是机灵鬼，我的宝贝儿。往后他自个儿会成为一个大人物的，只要你学他的样，他也会让你成为大人物的――亲爱的，我的手绢是在口袋外边吗？”费金说着骤然停了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Oliver wondered what picking the old gentleman's pocket in play, had to do with his chances of being a great man. But, thinking that the Jew, being so much his senior, must know best, he followed him quietly to the table, and was soon deeply involved in his new study.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="奥立弗弄不懂了，做做游戏，扒这位老绅士的衣袋，为何将来就有机会成为大人物。不过，他又一想，老犹太年纪比自己大得多，肯定什么都懂，便温驯地跟着他走到桌子跟前，不多一会儿就专心致志地投身于新的学业之中了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You're a clever boy, my dear," said the playful old gentleman, patting Oliver on the head approvingly. "I never saw a sharper lad. Here's a shilling for you.
