<div class="line_en">Sitting at the table she gazed at her students while thinking of what she would do after work. Maybe I'll go to the gym or stop at the market for something to eat tonight. Mechanically she continued with her lesson on the short letter "a" with her students. "The letter 'a' makes what sound?" "A, a, a…" the students sang together going through the empty motions. The clock dragged away the minutes teasing her with the tediousness of the day.</div>

<div class="line_en">What day is it today? Is it Tuesday or Thursday? This thought raced through her mind as she sat back with her students going over the lesson that never seemed to end. Didn't I just do this yesterday? Or was it a year ago? Hell, everything seemed to jumble together anymore. "Miss Smith, can I go to the bathroom?"Jorge asked, as he proceeded to jump from one foot to another, holding himself. How many times have I heard this? She wondered as she abruptly said, "Yes" and watched as he raced out of the room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="今天周几，周二还是周四？她一直带着学生们进行那似乎永无休止的复习。这件事我好像昨天刚刚做过？或者去年做过？烦死了，怎么都赶到一块儿了。“史密斯小姐，我可以去下洗手间吗？”正要迈腿跑出去的乔治，停下来问道。我是第几次听到这样的话了？她想着，随口答道，“好。”然后她看着他跑出了教室。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Won't it end? She thought as the phone rang out its morse code for her room. Sighing she stood up and walked through the maze of students desks to get to the phone. Picking up the receiver the other voice seemed a hundred miles away. Oh, how I wish I were anywhere but here. Her mind wandered to the hot exotic beach of Cabo, Mexico, where she had spent her last summer break. She still remembered the cool breezes that caressed her skin as she lay on the gritty sand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="该下课了吧？正想着，教室的电话响了。她叹了一口气，站起来，走过学生迷宫一样的课桌去接电话。话筒那端的声音似乎传自百里之外。哦，我多希望我现在不在这里啊。她的思绪飞到了异国情调浓郁的墨西哥卡波海滩，去年她在那儿度过了愉快的暑假。她慵懒地躺在沙滩上，阵阵微风轻吻她的肌肤，那种惬意的感觉，至今记忆犹新。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Miss Smith, did you hear me?" the secretary annoyingly asked her. "Oh, sorry. What did you say?" "Can you send Carla to the office?" the secretary impatiently asked. "Oh, course." she replied as she hung up the phone. She turned from the phone and yelled out Carla's name. Carla, who was one of the many who always seemed so needy that were in her class this year. Carla looked up from her desk, her hair hanging like a matted displaced doll. Her face was lined with dirt that gave her the appearance of one of those munchkins from the Wizard of Oz. "You need to go to the office." She said while Carla slowly rose from her desk. "Why do I have to go?" whined Carla. "It's between you and the office -- just go up." She hastily turned her back as Carla walked out of the room. Like having free school uniforms is the answer. It would be nice if just once someone called saying something nice or thanking me for all the endless crap I have to deal with. With a sigh she walked back to her other students who were clustered at the back table patiently waiting her return.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“史密斯小姐，你在听我讲话吗？”秘书不耐烦地问道。“哦，抱歉。刚才你说什么了？”“麻烦你让卡拉来我办公室一趟。”秘书更加不耐烦地说。“哦，当然可以。”说着，她挂断了电话。她转过身来叫卡拉的名字。卡拉是这个班上本年众多的贫困生之一。卡拉抬起头，松散的头发像一蓬乱草，满脸污垢，活像《绿野仙踪》里的一个稻草人。“你到办公室去一趟。”她对慢慢抬起头的卡拉说道。“为什么让我去？”卡拉嘀咕道。“让你去你就去——快去吧！”卡拉出去了，她匆忙地转回身。卡拉看样子是去领免费校服的。如果有人打电话来说些好话，或是对我做的这些令人讨厌的工作表示感谢，那该多好。她叹了口气，走回去，学生们都聚在后面的桌边耐心地等着她。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Senora, un momento por favor?" she turned her head and noticed the small shriveled man, his brown face lined with a map to places only he knew. "Thanks for helping my grandson Julio to read." the gentleman said in his faltering broken English. She immediately thought of Julio, who once as unreachable as a hardened walnut, slowly cracked opened to reveal the eager child inside. She thought of the inner struggle Julio must have had as he tried to make sense of the foreign letters and the sudden joy when he had unbroken the mysterious code. Was the grandfather the same? She looked up at this elderly gentleman, probably his grandfather, and quickly recognized the sameness of the two. "Gracias Senora" a weathered hand came out and firmly grasped hers with warmth that radiated from his soul to hers. Just as abruptly he removed his hand and left her. As he walked away she thought of that exotic sun and realized maybe it was closer to her than she thought.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“夫人，您好，可以打扰您几分钟吗？”她转过头来，一个窘迫的小个子男子出现在她面前，他那棕色的面庞布满皱纹。“谢谢您教我孙子胡里奥读书。”他用蹩脚的英语说道。她马上想起了胡里奥，外表看起来就像一个坚硬的核桃那么不易接近，后来渐渐地敞开了他充满渴盼的内心世界。她想胡里奥一定在暗下决心努力学好外语，并为自己能限免这神奇的密码而欢欣鼓舞。这位祖父也一样吗？她抬头看了看这位老人，也许是祖父，很快便找到了两人的共同之处。“谢谢您，夫人！”一只饱经沧桑的手，紧紧握住她的手，他的热情深深地感染了她。很快，他把手缩了回去，走开了。当他离开时，她想到了异国的阳光，而且也意识到，异国的阳光其实就近在咫尺。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The rest of the afternoon blurred into one long endless repetition. Finally the bell rang as a relief. As she led her students out the door they walked behind her as baby chicks returning to their fold. She noticed that their mother hens clucked to them behind the iron gate. As she proceeded to walk down the corridor, the air, which rose with the musical tingle of Spanish coloring everything that touched it, greeted her. She watched with a touch of envy as the children left her to return to those homes that probably were filled with laughter and warmth while she would once again return to the same endless march of boredom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这极其单调的工作重复了一下午。最后，解放的铃声终于响了。她带着学生走出教室，就像母鸡带着鸡崽儿回窝似的。她看到学生的妈妈们都在铁门外热切地期待着。当她路过走廊时，满载西班牙音乐气息的空气迎面扑来。她欣慰地看着孩子们离开，也许是回到充满欢声笑语的家，而自己却不得不再次回到那无尽的单调乏味中。">查看中文翻译</div>
