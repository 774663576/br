<div class="line_en">The third person in the trio was Lottie. She was a small thing and did not know what adversity meant, and was much bewildered by the alteration she saw in her young adopted mother. She had heard it rumored that strange things had happened to Sara, but she could not understand why she looked different -- why she wore an old black frock and came into the schoolroom only to teach instead of to sit in her place of honor and learn lessons herself. There had been much whispering among the little ones when it had been discovered that Sara no longer lived in the rooms in which Emily had so long sat in state. Lottie's chief difficulty was that Sara said so little when one asked her questions. At seven mysteries must be made very clear if one is to understand them.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Are you very poor now, Sara?" she had asked confidentially the first morning her friend took charge of the small French class. "Are you as poor as a beggar?" She thrust a fat hand into the slim one and opened round, tearful eyes. "I don't want you to be as poor as a beggar."</div>

<div class="line_en">But Lottie was a determined little person. If Sara would not tell her where she lived, she would find out in some other way. She talked to her small companions and hung about the elder girls and listened when they were gossiping; and acting upon certain information they had unconsciously let drop, she started late one afternoon on a voyage of discovery, climbing stairs she had never known the existence of, until she reached the attic floor. There she found two doors near each other, and opening one, she saw her beloved Sara standing upon an old table and looking out of a window.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是洛蒂是个有决心的小家伙。如果萨拉不告诉她住在哪儿，她会想别的办法找到那地方。她和小伙伴们交谈，紧跟着大女孩们，听她们闲谈，根据她们无意中泄露的消息采取行动，因此在有天傍晚开始四处寻找，爬上她从不知其存在的楼梯，来到阁楼那一层。她发现有两扇门紧挨在一起，打开其中的一扇，看见她所热爱的萨拉站在一张旧桌子上，眺望着窗外。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Isn't it?" gasped Lottie, and as she looked round it she bit her lip. She was a spoiled child yet, but she was fond enough of her adopted parent to make an effort to control herself for her sake. Then, somehow, it was quite possible that any place in which Sara lived might turn out to be nice. "Why isn't it, Sara?" she almost whispered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不坏吗？”洛蒂喘着气说，她咬着嘴唇环顾了一下四周。她眼下依然是个娇惯的孩子，不过为了她深深爱着的养母，她努力控制住了自己。这么说，凡是萨拉住的地方不晓得什么缘故都完全可能变成好地方落啦。“为什么不算太坏，萨拉？”声音轻得几乎像耳语。">查看中文翻译</div>

The sparrows, being at home there, twittered and hopped about quite without fear. Two of them perched on the chimney top nearest and quarrelled with each other fiercely until one pecked the other and drove him away. The garret window next to theirs was shut because the house next door was empty.</div>

<div class="line_en">The sky seemed so much nearer than when one saw it from the street, that Lottie was enchanted. From the attic window, among the chimney pots, the things which were happening in the world below seemed almost unreal.

<div class="line_cn" title="天空似乎比从街道上看去近得多，这使洛蒂着迷。从阁楼窗子穿过烟囱管之间望去，下面的世界正在发生的事情显得几乎并不真实。你很难相信有铭钦女士、阿米莉亚小姐以及教室的存在，而场院里的隆隆车轮声似乎是属于另一个世界的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When they threw out a few crumbs the sparrow jumped and flew away to an adjacent chimney top. He was evidently not accustomed to intimates in attics, and unexpected crumbs startled him. But when Lottie remained quite still and Sara chirped very softly -- almost as if she were a sparrow herself -- he saw that the thing which had alarmed him represented hospitality, after all. He put his head on one side, and from his perch on the chimney looked down at the crumbs with twinkling eyes. Lottie could scarcely keep still.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她俩刚把一些面包屑扔出去，那只麻雀就跳起来飞到邻近的烟囱顶上。它显然不习惯于阁楼中的亲密朋友，被意外出现的面包屑吓着了。但是那时洛蒂保持着绝对安静，而萨拉非常轻柔地学着小鸟的啁啾声一一好像她自己简直就是一只麻雀一一那麻雀看清了刚才把它吓一跳的东西原来是对它的款待。它把头 一侧，从烟囱上栖息的地方眨巴着眼睛朝下望着面包屑。洛蒂几乎没法再保持不动了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He flew down and hopped toward the crumbs, but stopped a few inches away from them, putting his head on one side again, as if reflecting on the chances that Sara and Lottie might turn out to be big cats and jump on him.

Lottie was so delighted that she quite forgot her first shocked impression of the attic.

<div class="line_en">"It is so little and so high above everything," she said, "that it is almost like a nest in a tree. The slanting ceiling is so funny. See, you can scarcely stand up at this end of the room; and when the morning begins to come I can lie in bed and look right up into the sky through that flat window in the roof. It is like a square patch of light. If the sun is going to shine, little pink clouds float about, and I feel as if I could touch them. And if it rains, the drops patter and patter as if they were saying something nice. Then if there are stars, you can lie and try to count how many go into the patch. It takes such a lot. And just look at that tiny, rusty grate in the corner. If it was polished and there was a fire in it, just think how nice it would be. You see, it's really a beautiful little room."</div>

<div class="line_en">When Sara had persuaded her to go downstairs again, and, after setting her on her way, had come back to her attic, she stood in the middle of it and looked about her. The enchantment of her imaginings for Lottie had died away. The bed was hard and covered with its dingy quilt. The whitewashed wall showed its broken patches, the floor was cold and bare, the grate was broken and rusty, and the battered footstool, tilted sideways on its injured leg, the only seat in the room. She sat down on it for a few minutes and let her head drop in her hands. The mere fact that Lottie had come and gone away again made things seem a little worse -- just as perhaps prisoners feel a little more desolate after visitors come and go, leaving them behind.</div>

<div class="line_en">"You see," she said, "there could be a thick, soft blue Indian rug on the floor; and in that corner there could be a soft little sofa, with cushions to curl up on; and just over it could be a shelf full of books so that one could reach them easily; and there could be a fur rug before the fire, and hangings on the wall to cover up the whitewash, and pictures. They would have to be little ones, but they could be beautiful; and there could be a lamp with a deep rose-colored shade; and a table in the middle, with things to have tea with; and a little fat copper kettle singing on the hob; and the bed could be quite different. It could be made soft and covered with a lovely silk coverlet. It could be beautiful. And perhaps we could coax the sparrows until we made such friends with them that they would come and peck at the window and ask to be let in."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你看，”萨拉说，“这儿的地板伤可以铺一块又厚又软的兰色印度地毯，在那个墙角可以方一只柔软的小沙发，有些靠垫供你蜷起身子在上面歇息，沙发正前方可以有只放满书的书架，这样可以很容易够得着，壁炉前可以放一块裘皮小地毯，墙上挂上帷幕遮住白色的墙灰。还挂上些图画，它们必须是小幅的，但该是美丽的，还可以有盏灯，罩着深玫瑰色的灯罩，一张桌子放在屋中央，上面放着茶具，有一把圓墩墩的小铜壶在炉架上嗞嗞地响。床铺可以和现在的完全不同，可以做得很软，盖着讨人喜欢的丝质床罩，全都是美丽的。也许我们能够诱导那些麻雀和我们做好朋友，它们就会来啄窗子，要求进来。”">查看中文翻译</div>

He had a wife and a large family in the wall, and they had had frightfully bad luck for several days. He had left the children crying bitterly, and felt he would risk a good deal for a few crumbs, so he cautiously dropped upon his feet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她静静地坐着，老鼠开始鼓起勇气来。它固然很怕她，但也许它有一颗像麻雀那样的心，告诉它萨拉不是一个会猛扑过来的东西。它很饿。它在墙壁中有妻子和一大帮家人，几天来它们的运气实在太坏。它离开了痛哭流涕的孩子们，觉得无论如何也要冒挺大的风险去找到一些面包屑，于是它小心翼翼地放下了前足。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">How it is that animals understand things I do not know, but it is certain that they do understand. Perhaps there is a language which is not made of words and everything in the world understands it. Perhaps there is a soul hidden in everything and it can always speak, without even making a sound, to another soul. But whatsoever was the reason, the rat knew from that moment that he was safe -- even though he was a rat. He knew that this young human being sitting on the red footstool would not jump up and terrify him with wild, sharp noises or throw heavy objects at him which, if they did not fall and crush him, would send him limping in his scurry back to his hole. He was really a very nice rat, and did not mean the least harm. When he had stood on his hind legs and sniffed the air, with his bright eyes fixed on Sara, he had hoped that she would understand this, and would not begin by hating him as an enemy. When the mysterious thing which speaks without saying any words told him that she would not, he went softly toward the crumbs and began to eat them. As he did it he glanced every now and then at Sara, just as the sparrows had done, and his expression was so very apologetic that it touched her heart.</div>
