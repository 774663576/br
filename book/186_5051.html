<div class="line_en">As he rose to his feet he noticed that he was neither dripping nor panting for breath as anyone would expect after being under water. His clothes were perfectly dry. He was standing by the edge of a small pool -- not more than ten feet from side to side in a wood. The trees grew close together and were so leafy that he could get no glimpse of the sky. All the light was green light that came through the leaves: but there must have been a very strong sun overhead, for this green daylight was bright and warm. It was the quietest wood you could possibly imagine. There were no birds, no insects, no animals, and no wind. You could almost feel the trees growing. The pool he had just got out of was not the only pool. There were dozens of others -- a pool every few yards as far as his eyes could reach. You could almost feel the trees drinking the water up with their roots. This wood was very much alive. When he tried to describe it afterwards Digory always said, "It was a rich place: as rich as plumcake."</div>

<div class="line_en">Uncle Andrew and his study vanished instantly. Then, for a moment, everything became muddled. The next thing Digory knew was that there was a soft green light coming down on him from above, and darkness below. He didn't seem to be standing on anything, or sitting, or lying. Nothing appeared to be touching him. "I believe I'm in water," said Digory. "Or under water." This frightened him for a second, but almost at once he could feel that he was rushing upwards. Then his head suddenly came out into the air and, he found himself scrambling ashore, out on to smooth grassy ground at the edge of a pool.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="安德鲁舅舅和他的书房立刻消失了。之后的一刹那，四周昏暗而迷茫。接着，迪格雷感到，头顶上射来一束柔和的绿光，下面一片漆黑。他似乎既未站在什么上面，也未坐在或躺在什么上面，四周空空如也。“我相信自己在水中。”迪格雷说，“要么在水下。”这使他吓了一跳，但他马上就觉得在往上冲。突然，他的脑袋接触到空气，他发现自己钻了出来，在水潭边平坦的碧草地上趴着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The strangest thing was that, almost before he had looked about him, Digory had half forgotten how he had come there. At any rate, he was certainly not thinking about Polly, or Uncle Andrew, or even his Mother. He was not in the least frightened, or excited, or curious. If anyone had asked him "Where did you come from?" he would probably have said, "I've always been here." That was what it felt like -- as if one had always been in that place and never been bored although nothing had ever happened. As he said long afterwards, "It's not the sort of place where things happen. The trees go on growing, that's all."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最奇怪的是，还来不及东张西望，迪格雷便差不多忘了他是如何到那里的。他怎么也想不起波莉、安德鲁舅舅，甚至他的妈妈。他丝毫不感到害怕，不激动也不好奇。要是有人问他：“你从哪儿来？”他很可能会说，“我一直在这儿。”就是这种感觉——尽管没发生什么事，你却好像一直在那里，从来没有厌烦过。正如他很久以后说的：“那是个不会有什么事的地方。只是树木在不停地生长。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After Digory had looked at the wood for a long time he noticed that there was a girl lying on her back at the foot of a tree a few yards away. Her eyes were nearly shut but not quite, as if she were just between sleeping and waking. So he looked at her for a long time and said nothing. And at last she opened her eyes and looked at him for a long time and she also said nothing. Then she spoke, in a dreamy, contented sort of voice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪格雷久久地注视着那片树林，然后，他发现，离他不远的地方，一个女孩正躺在一棵树下，眼睛微微闭着，似睡非睡的模样。他看了很久，没说话。她却用梦呓般的心满意足的语调说话了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The girl now sat up, really interested at last. They stared very hard at one another, trying to remember. And then, at exactly the same moment, she shouted out "Mr Ketterley" and he shouted out "Uncle Andrew", and they knew who they were and began to remember the whole story. After a few minutes hard talking they had got it straight. Digory explained how beastly Uncle Andrew had been.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那女孩终于有了兴趣，坐了起来。他们互相凝视着，试图回忆往事。几乎就在同时，她喊道“凯特利先生”，他喊道“安德鲁舅舅”，两人都明白了自己是谁，并开始回想事情的全部经过。艰难地谈了一阵后，他们完全清醒了。迪格雷述说了安德鲁舅舅如何像畜生一样冷酷无情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Why! it's a guinea-pig," said the girl. And it was -- a fat guinea-pig, nosing about in the grass. But round the middle of the guinea-pig there ran a tape, and, tied on to it by the tape, was a bright yellow ring.</div>

<div class="line_en">Neither of them much liked the idea of jumping into that pool, but neither said so to the other. They took hands and said "One -- Two -- Three -- Go" and jumped. There was a great splash and of course they closed their eyes. But when they opened them again they found they were still standing, hand in hand, in the green wood, and hardly up to their ankles in water. The pool was apparently only a couple of inches deep. They splashed back on to the dry ground.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们谁也不太想跳进水潭，但谁都没有说出口。他们手拉手，喊道“一、二、三，跳”便跳了进去。水花飞溅，他们自然闭上了双眼，但当他们睁开眼时，他们仍然手拉手地站在那片绿树林里，水只淹没到他们的踝部。显然，水潭只有几寸深。他们又蹚着水回到陆地上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Polly looked puzzled. "Don't you see?" said Digory. "No, do listen. Think of our tunnel under the slates at home. It isn't a room in any of the houses. In a way, it isn't really part of any of the houses. But once you're in the tunnel you can go along it and come into any of the houses in the row. Mightn't this wood be the same? -- a place that isn't in any of the worlds, but once you've found that place you can get into them all."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="波莉迷惑不解。“你难道不明白？”迪格雷说，“那么听我讲。想想家里那些石板下的隧道吧。它不是任何房子的一个房间，也就是说，它不是真正属于哪幢房子的某个部分。但只要你进去了，就可以沿着隧道，走进那一排房子中的任何一幢。这片林子不也一样吗？——一个不属于任何世界的地方，但只要找对了，你就可以到达所有的世界。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh bother Uncle Andrew," interrupted Digory. "I don't believe he knows anything about it. He never had the pluck to come here himself. He only talked of one Other World. But suppose there were dozens?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"And of course that explains everything," he said. "That's why it is so quiet and sleepy here. Nothing ever happens here. Like at home. It's in the houses that people talk, and do things, and have meals. Nothing goes on in the inbetween places, behind the walls and above the ceilings and under the floor, or in our own tunnel. But when you come out of our tunnel you may find yourself in any house. I think we can get out of this place into jolly well Anywhere! We don't need to jump back into the same pool we came up by. Or not just yet."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然，这样一切就都可以解释清楚。”他说，“为什么这里安静得让人昏昏欲睡，原因就在于此。这里从来没有发生过什么事。就像在家里，人们在房子里谈话、做事、吃饭，但在中间地带、墙后面、天花板上、地板底下，或者在我们的隧道里，什么事也没有。但如果你走出隧道，就会发现自己到了一幢房子里。我想，我们可以从这里出去，随便到哪里去！我们不需要跳回我们来的那个水潭。至少现在不。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Digory wanted to be the one who shouted "Change" but Polly wouldn't agree.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="经过一番争执，他们都同意戴上绿戒指（“绿色是安全色，”迪格雷说，“这样，你怎么都能记住哪枚戒指派什么用场。”），手拉手地跳下去。但是，在快到安德鲁舅舅的书房、即将回到自己的世界日寸，波莉将喊一声“换”，他们就脱掉绿戒指，戴上黄的。迪格雷想要喊这一声“换”，但波莉不同意。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At first there were bright lights moving about in a black sky; Digory always thinks these were stars and even swears that he saw Jupiter quite close -- close enough to see its moon. But almost at once there were rows and rows of roofs and chimney pots about them, and they could see St Paul's and knew they were looking at London. But you could see through the walls of all the houses.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="起初，夜空中游移着明亮的灯光：迪格雷总认为是星星，甚至发誓，他在离得很近的地方看见了木星，连它的卫星也看得一清二楚。接着，周围很快出现了一排一排的屋顶和烟囱的管帽，他们看见圣保罗大教堂，知道已经到了伦敦，而且，能够穿透墙壁，看见房子里面。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then they could see Uncle Andrew, very vague and shadowy, but getting clearer and more solid-looking all the time, just as if he were coming into focus. But before he became quite real Polly shouted "Change", and they did change, and our world faded away like a dream, and the green light above grew stronger and stronger, till their heads came out of the pool and they scrambled ashore. And there was the wood all about them, as green and bright and still as ever. The whole thing had taken less than a minute.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们看见安德鲁舅舅模模糊糊的身影，正在越变越清晰、越变越固定，似乎将逐渐聚为视线的中心。就在安德鲁舅舅的身影即将变得完全清晰的时候，波莉喊了一声“换”；他们一换戒指，我们这个世界便像梦一样淡去了，他们头上的绿光越来越强，最后，他们又钻出水潭，趴在岸边。那片树林仍一如既往地青翠、明亮和安静。事情的全部过程发生在不到一分钟的时间里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There!" said Digory. "That's alright. Now for the adventure. Any pool will do. Come on. Let's try that one."</div>

<div class="line_en">They stared at each other and turned quite white as they realized the dreadful thing that Digory had just been going to do. For there were any number of pools in the wood, and the pools were all alike and the trees were all alike, so that if they had once left behind the pool that led to our own world without making some sort of landmark, the chances would have been a hundred to one against their ever finding it again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们面面相觑。当意识到迪格雷刚才差点儿就要做的事有多么严重的后果时，两人脸都吓白了。因为林子里有很多水潭，外表十分相似，树木也没有区别，一旦他们离开了通向我们这个世界的水潭而没有留下任何标记，能重新找到的可能性只有百分之一。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Splash! Once again it hadn't worked. This pool, too, appeared to be only a puddle. Instead of reaching a new world they only got their feet wet and splashed their legs for the second time that morning (if it was a morning: it seems to be always the same time in the Wood between the Worlds).</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="水花飞溅！又失败了。这个水潭好像只是一个小水坑。他们没能到达新的世界；那天早晨，已是第二次湿了脚，腿上也溅了水（假设是早晨吧：各个世界之间的树林里似乎没有时间的变化）。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well don't keep on gassing about it," said Digory. "Come along, I want to see what's in one of the other pools." And Polly gave him a pretty sharp answer and he said something even nastier in reply. The quarrel lasted for several minutes but it would be dull to write it all down. Let us skip on to the moment at which they stood with beating hearts and rather scared faces on the edge of the unknown pool with their yellow rings on and held hands and once more said "One -- Two -- Three -- Go!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“行了，别老吹牛，”迪格雷说，“来吧，我想看看别的水潭里有什么。”波莉回答得尖刻，迪格雷又回敬了几句难听的话。争吵持续了好几分钟，但如果写下来就很枯燥。让我们跳过这一段吧。接着，他们戴上黄戒指，手拉手紧张地站在水潭边上，心怦怦地跳着，再次喊道：“一、二、三，跳！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Digory's hand was shaking as he opened his penknife and cut out a long strip of turf on the bank of the pool. The soil (which smelled nice) was of a rich reddish brown and showed up well against the green. "It's a good thing one of us has some sense," said Polly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪格雷颤着手打开了铅笔刀，在水潭边割下一块长长的草皮。泥土（有清香味）呈深暗的红褐色，在绿色的草中十分显眼。“幸亏我们中间有一个人想到了。”波莉说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Now the truth was that Uncle Andrew, who knew nothing about the Wood between the Worlds, had quite a wrong idea about the rings. The yellow ones weren't "outward" rings and the green ones weren't "homeward" rings; at least, not in the way he thought. The stuff of which both were made had all come from the wood. The stuff in the yellow rings had the power of drawing you into the wood; it was stuff that wanted to get back to its own place, the in-between place. But the stuff in the green rings is stuff that is trying to get out of its own place: so that a green ring would take you out of the wood into a world. Uncle Andrew, you see, was working with things he did not really understand; most magicians are. Of course Digory did not realize the truth quite clearly either, or not till later. But when they had talked it over, they decided to try their green rings on the new pool, just to see what happened.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其实，安德鲁舅舅对世界之间的树林毫不知哓，对戒指的认识也是错的。黄戒指不是“离去”的戒指，绿戒指也不是“回返”的戒指，至少，不是他理解的那种意思。两种戒指都是用取自这片树林的材料制成的。黄戒指的材料有一种“向心力”，能将你带往树林，是材料本身回归本土，回归那片中间地带。但绿戒指的材料有种“离心力”，想脱离本土，故能带你离开树林。你看，安德鲁舅舅连自己干的事情都没有真正弄懂，大多数魔法师都是这样。当然，迪格雷也没有完全认识到真相，或者，到后来才明白。经过商议，他们决定戴上绿戒指，再跳进去试试，看看结果如何。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Blast and botheration!" exclaimed Digory. "What's gone wrong now? We've put our yellow rings on all right. He said yellow for the outward journey."</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'm game if you are," said Polly. But she really said this because, in her heart of hearts, she now felt sure that neither kind of ring was going to work at all in the new pool, and so there was nothing worse to be afraid of than another splash. I am not quite sure that Digory had not the same feeling. At any rate, when they had both put on their greens and come back to the edge of the water, and taken hands again, they were certainly a good deal more cheerful and less solemn than they had been the first time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你愿意我也愿意。”波莉说。她之所以这样说，是因为她打心眼里相信，无论哪种戒指都不会在新的水潭里起作用，最多再溅起一阵水花，没什么可怕的。不管怎样，他们戴上绿戒指，又手拉手地站到水边。这一次，他们显得兴高采烈，全不像第一次那么严肃。">查看中文翻译</div>
