Then she was out the window and on the porch and running down the street faster than she'd ever run in gym class.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Why?" he said. "Is this about tonight?" In Park's head, it felt like everything must be about tonight. Like nothing that good and this bad could happen on the same night unless they were related. Whatever this was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="帕克问：“为什么？因为今晚的事吗？”在帕克的想法里，一切都跟今晚有关。因为这么美好和这么恐怖的事不可能发生在同一个晚上，除非两者有关系。不管是什么关系。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I have to leave," she said. She was looking across the table like she'd just seen a ghost. Like she was one.</div>
