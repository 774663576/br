<div class="line_en">She lies in the darkness for a long time. Breathing in the smell of wood shavings. She thinks about the Harry Potter quotation that Granny nicked for one of her stories from the Land-of-Almost-Awake. It's from Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, which is obviously ironic, and to understand this one would need to be fairly well informed about the differences between the Harry Potter books and Harry Potter films, as well as fairly well informed about the meaning of "ironic."</div>

<div class="line_en">It's ironic because that quotation isn't in the book, which Elsa likes a lot more than the film, though the book is not one of her favorite Harry Potter books. Now when she thinks of it, possibly it isn't ironic after all. She has to Wikipedia this properly, she thinks, sitting up. And that is when the letter drops into her lap. It's been taped to the wardrobe ceiling. She has no idea how long it's been there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这很讽刺，因为书里并没有这句话，而比起电影爱莎更喜欢书，即使这一本并不是她在“哈利·波特”系列小说里最爱的一本。现在想起来，也许这一点儿也不讽刺。她得好好在维基百科上查一下，想到这里，她坐起身。就在这时，这封信掉在了她的腿上。它原本粘在衣橱的天花板上，不知道在那儿多久了。">查看中文翻译</div>

"There's been some damned accident up on the highway. All city-bound traffic has been stuck for hours," he says, as if this is something that will interest Elsa. It doesn't -- she's too interested in the letter. Alf only reads it after a lot of nagging.</div>

<div class="line_en">Elsa's eyes open wide when she sees him, and then she looks at Alf's flat. At the radio. Because there's no coincidence in fairy tales. And there's a Russian playwright who once said that if there's a pistol hanging on the wall in the first act, it has to be fired before the last act is over. Elsa knows that. And those who can't understand by now how Elsa understands things like that just haven't been paying attention. So Elsa understands that the whole thing with the radio and the accident on the highway must have something to do with the fairy tale they're in.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱莎瞪大眼睛看着他，然后看向阿尔夫的公寓，看向收音机。童话故事里是没有巧合的。有位俄国剧作家曾经说过，如果在第一幕时墙上挂着把手枪，那么在最后一幕结束前枪必须得响。爱莎知道这一点。爱莎明白收音机和高速公路上的车祸一定与他们所在的这个童话故事有关。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Alf convinces the police to make a pass around the block "to make sure everything is safe." Elsa never finds out exactly what he says to them, but Alf can be quite persuasive when he wants to be. Maybe he says that he's seen footprints in the snow. Or heard someone in the house on the other side of the street tell him something. Elsa doesn't know, but she sees the summer-intern policeman get into the car, and sees Green-eyes do the same after lengthy deliberation. Elsa meets her gaze for a second, and if she had only told Green-eyes the truth about the wurse, then maybe everything would have ended up differently. But she didn't.

<div class="line_cn" title="阿尔夫说服警察去这个街区巡视一下，“以保证一切都安全”。爱莎一直没有弄明白他到底对警察说了什么，但只要阿尔夫想的话，他是很有说服力的。也许他说在雪地里看见过脚印，或者街道另一头房子里的某人跟他说过什么。爱莎不知道，但她看见“暑期工”警察坐进车里，绿眼睛考虑一番也做出同样的决定。爱莎跟她的目光交汇了一秒钟，如果她告诉绿眼睛呜嘶的真相，也许一切事情都会不同。但她没有。因为她想保护呜嘶。因为她就是这种朋友。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">If Elsa had stopped and reflected a little on it, maybe things would have turned out differently. But she didn't. So they didn't. It's possible that the wurse hesitated for a moment outside Britt-Marie's door. Elsa would have understood if it had done that, just like she supposes that wurses hesitate sometimes when they're unsure about who in this fairy tale they've really been sent to protect. Wurses actually guard princesses in normal fairy tales, and even in the Land-of-Almost-Awake Elsa was never more than a knight. Yet if the wurse had any hesitation, it didn't show it. It went with Elsa. Because that's the sort of friend it is.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果爱莎就此停下，对它做出一些反应，也许事情也将会不同。但她没有，所以事情也没有跟着发生变化。有可能呜嘶在布里特—玛丽的门前犹豫了片刻。爱莎能理解它这么做的原因，她猜呜嘶们有时会犹豫，不确定自己被派到这个童话故事中，到底是要保护谁。呜嘶们在普通的童话故事里通常保护公主，而爱莎即使在不眠大陆也是一名不折不扣的骑士。然而就算呜嘶有过犹豫，它也没有表现出来。它跟爱莎一起走了，因为它就是这种朋友。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There's a smell inside Audi that makes her feel surprisingly peaceful. She doesn't quite know why. She looks at the wurse through the open door, and before she has time to realize what is about to happen, she wonders if maybe it doesn't want to jump into the car because it's in pain. She knows it is feeling pain, pain the way Granny had pain everywhere in her body at the end.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sam comes darting out from behind the backseat, Elsa feels the coldness against her lips when his hand closes over her mouth. His muscles tense around her throat; she feels the hairs on his skin scraping like gravel through the gaps in the Gryffindor scarf. She has time to see the brief confusion in Sam's eyes when he sees the boy. It's the moment when he realizes he's been hunting the wrong child. She has time to understand that the shadows in the fairy tale didn't want to kill the Chosen One. Only steal him. Make him their own. Kill whoever stood in their way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆从后座冒出来，用手捂住爱莎的嘴巴时，她的嘴唇感觉到一阵冰凉。他手臂上的肌肉紧绷，包围了她的脖子，他的汗毛穿透格兰芬多围巾的空隙，像沙砾一般刮擦着她的皮肤。她有时间注意到山姆看见男孩时眼中的迷茫。这一刻他意识到自己追错了孩子。她忽然明白童话故事里的暗影并不想杀死天选之子，只想把他偷走，把他据为己有。任何人胆敢阻拦，都将被暗影杀死。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Elsa sees her feet moving, but she's not guiding them herself. Her body is running by instinct. She thinks that she and the boy have had time to make half a dozen steps when she hears the wurse howling in horrendous pain, and she doesn't know if it's the boy who lets go of her hand or if she lets go of his. Her pulse is beating so hard that she can feel it in her eyes. The boy slips and falls to the ground. Elsa hears the back door of Audi opening and sees the knife in Sam's hand. Sees the blood on it. She does the only thing she can do: picks the boy up as best she can and runs as fast as possible.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱莎看见自己的脚在移动，但感觉它们不受控制。她的身体被本能支配。她觉得她和男孩还有时间再跑几步时，呜嘶传来痛苦的哀嚎，她不知是男孩松开了她的手，还是她松开了他的。她的脉搏跳得很快，快得仿佛是在她的眼睛里跳动。男孩滑了一下，摔在地上。爱莎听见奥迪后车门打开的声音，看见山姆手中的刀，还看见刀上的血。她做了她唯一能做的：尽力扶起男孩，尽可能以最快的速度离开。">查看中文翻译</div>

And Maud's scream. And Dad's hands. The hard floor in the stairwell. The world spins until it lands, swaying upside down in front of her, and she thinks that this must be how it is when you die.

Until she sees the shadow through the glass in the entrance door. Sees Sam on the other side. He's standing still. And something about his face is so deeply uncharacteristic of him that, at first, Elsa can't quite shake off the feeling that she is imagining the whole thing.</div>
