<div class="line_en">I can't very well say it's so I can carry out my own personal vendetta against Snow.

<div class="line_en">The next morning, when we report for training at 7:30, reality slaps me in the face. We've been funneled into a class of relative beginners, fourteen- or fifteen-year-olds, which seems a little insulting until it's obvious that they're in far better condition than we are. Gale and the other people already chosen to go to the Capitol are in a different, accelerated phase of training. After we stretch -- which hurts -- there's a couple of hours of strengthening exercises -- which hurt -- and a five-mile run -- which kills. Even with Johanna's motivational insults driving me on, I have to drop out after a mile.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天早上七点半，当我们报到参加训练时，却当头挨了一棒。我们被安排在一个刚开始进行训练的小组里，里面都是十四五岁的孩子，真是有点丢人。可是在实际训练中，他们却表现得比我们强得多。盖尔和其他被挑选参加战斗的人都进行了更高一级的训练。我们先做伸展运动——我的伤挺疼——接着是一两个小时的力量训练——我疼痛难忍——然后跑五英里——我疼得要死。即使约翰娜一直不停地在羞辱我，我也不得不在跑了一英里之后放弃。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Twenty-four needle jabs to my rib cage later, I'm flattened out on my hospital bed, gritting my teeth to keep from begging them to bring back my morphling drip. It's been by my bed so I can take a hit as needed. I haven't used it lately, but I kept it for Johanna's sake. Today they tested my blood to make sure it was clean of the painkiller, as the mixture of the two drugs -- the morphling and whatever's set my ribs on fire -- has dangerous side effects. They made it clear I would have a difficult couple of days. But I told them to go ahead.</div>

<div class="line_en">It's a bad night in our room. Sleep's out of the question. I think I can actually smell the ring of flesh around my chest burning, and Johanna's fighting off withdrawal symptoms. Early on, when I apologize about cutting off her morphling supply, she waves it off, saying it had to happen anyway. But by three in the morning, I'm the target of every colorful bit of profanity District 7 has to offer. At dawn, she drags me out of bed, determined to get to training.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在病房的夜晚真是难熬，睡觉是不可能了。我觉得甚至可以闻到我肋骨周围的一圈肉被灼烧的味道。约翰娜在与停药后的脱瘾反应作斗争。早先，我为停用吗啡的事向她道歉时，她挥挥手表示无所谓，并且说总会有这么一天的。但是到了凌晨三点，七区所有的花哨的骂人话雨点般向我砸来。可不管怎样，到了清晨，她还是把我从床上拽起来，去参加训练。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's just water. It won't kill us," I say. She clenches her jaw and stomps out into the mud. Rain drenches us as we work our bodies and then slog around the running course. I bail after a mile again, and I have to resist the temptation to take off my shirt so the cold water can sizzle off my ribs. I force down my field lunch of soggy fish and beet stew. Johanna gets halfway through her bowl before it comes back up. In the afternoon, we learn to assemble our guns. I manage it, but Johanna can't hold her hands steady enough to fit the parts together. When York's back is turned, I help her out. Even though the rain continues, the afternoon's an improvement because we're on the shooting range. At last, something I'm good at. It takes some adjusting from a bow to a gun, but by the end of the day, I've got the best score in my class.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这只是水，要不了我们的命。”我说。她咬紧牙关，脚踏在泥地里。雨水浸透了衣服，我们在操场的泥地上艰难前行。我跑了一英里之后，不得不再次放弃。我强忍着才没把衬衫脱掉，那样冰凉的雨水就会打在我灼烧的肋部皮肤上，带走它的热量。中饭在野外吃，是泡了水的鱼和炖甜菜，我强迫自己往下咽。约翰娜吃了一半就都吐了出来。下午，我们练习组装枪支。我总算完成了，可约翰娜的手抖得厉害，没法把枪的部件组装起来。约克一转身，我就帮她弄。虽然雨没有停，但下午总算有所进展，我们开始练习射击。终于轮到我擅长的部分了。我把射箭的技巧运用到射击上。下午结束训练时，我的射击成绩全组第一。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你行，我们都行。我们是胜利者，你还记得吗？无论有多难，我们都活下来了。”她冲我咆哮道。她病蔫蔫的，脸色灰里透青，身体抖得像一片树叶。我赶紧穿好衣服。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We must be victors to make it through the morning. I think I'm going to lose Johanna when we realize it's pouring outside. Her face turns ashen and she seems to have ceased breathing.</div>

When she tries to get discharged from the hospital, they won't agree to let her live alone, even if she comes in for daily talks with the head doctor. I think they may have put two and two together about the morphling and this only adds to their view that she's unstable. "She won't be alone. I'm going to room with her," I announce. There's some dissent, but Haymitch takes our part, and by bedtime, we have a compartment across from Prim and my mother, who agrees to keep an eye on us.</div>

<div class="line_en">We join a group that includes Delly, Annie, and Finnick. It's something to see Finnick's transformation since his marriage. His earlier incarnations -- the decadent Capitol heartthrob I met before the Quell, the enigmatic ally in the arena, the broken young man who tried to help me hold it together -- these have been replaced by someone who radiates life. Finnick's real charms of self-effacing humor and an easygoing nature are on display for the first time. He never lets go of Annie's hand. Not when they walk, not when they eat. I doubt he ever plans to. She's lost in some daze of happiness. There are still moments when you can tell something slips in her brain and another world blinds her to us. But a few words from Finnick call her back.</div>

<div class="line_en">I'm starving and the stew is so delicious -- beef, potatoes, turnips, and onions in a thick gravy -- that I have to force myself to slow down. All around the dining hall, you can feel the rejuvenating effect that a good meal can bring on. The way it can make people kinder, funnier, more optimistic, and remind them it's not a mistake to go on living. It's better than any medicine. So I try to make it last and join in the conversation. Sop up the gravy on my bread and nibble on it as I listen to Finnick telling some ridiculous story about a sea turtle swimming off with his hat. Laugh before I realize he's standing there. Directly across the table, behind the empty seat next to Johanna. Watching me. I choke momentarily as the gravy bread sticks in my throat.</div>

<div class="line_en">Delly, who I've known since I was little but never gave much thought to, has grown in my estimation. She was told what Peeta said to me that night after the wedding, but she's not a gossip. Haymitch says she's the best defender I have when Peeta goes off on some kind of tear about me. Always taking my side, blaming his negative perceptions on the Capitol's torture. She has more influence on him than any of the others do, because he really does know her. Anyway, even if she's sugarcoating my good points, I appreciate it. Frankly, I could use a little sugarcoating.</div>
