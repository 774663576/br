<div class="line_en">Aragorn sped on up the hill. Every now and again he bent to the ground. Hobbits go light, and their footprints are not easy even for a Ranger to read, but not far from the top a spring crossed the path, and in the wet earth he saw what he was seeking.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I read the signs aright," he said to himself. "Frodo ran to the hilltop. I wonder what he saw there? But he returned by the same way, and went down the hill again."</div>

<div class="line_en">Aragorn hesitated. He desired to go to the high seat himself, hoping to see there something that would guide him in his perplexities; but time was pressing. Suddenly he leaped forward, and ran to the summit, across the great flag-stones, and up the steps. Then sitting in the high seat he looked out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿拉贡迟疑了。他想要坐上王座，看看是否有迹象可以协助他在这一团迷雾中找到出路，时间非常紧迫，不容许他浪费了。他箭步冲向前，奔上阶梯，然后坐上王座，往四下看去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But the sun seemed darkened, and the world dim and remote. He turned from the North back again to North, and saw nothing save the distant hills, unless it were that far away he could see again a great bird like an eagle high in the air, descending slowly in wide circles down towards the earth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是，太阳似乎黯淡下来，世界变得十分遥远灰暗。他往四周看去，除了连绵不断的山丘之外还是山丘，唯一特殊的地方是他又看见远处有一只巨鹰，仿佛正在盘旋着缓缓飘降到地面去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Even as he gazed his quick ears caught sounds in the woodlands below, on the west side of the River. He stiffened. There were cries, and among them, to his horror, he could distinguish the harsh voices of Orcs. Then suddenly with a deep-throated call a great horn blew, and the blasts of it smote the hills and echoed in the hollows, rising in a mighty shout above the roaring of the falls.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在此同时，他灵敏的听觉发现了河西边有些不寻常的动静。他浑身一僵，底下传来叫喊声，让他恐惧不已的是其中竟然有半兽人的声音。接着，在一声低沉的呐喊声之后，传来了惊天动地的号角声；如闷雷般的号角声在山谷之间来回震动，甚至压过了瀑布的巨大声响。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The horn of Boromir!" he cried. "He is in need!" He sprang down the steps and away, leaping down the path. "Alas! An ill fate is on me this day, and all that I do goes amiss. Where is Sam?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“波罗莫的号角声！”他大喊着：“他需要我们的帮助！”他立刻跳下阶梯，沿着小径往回跑。“该死！今天我做的每个决定都出错，山姆到哪里去了？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As he ran the cries came louder, but fainter now and desperately the horn was blowing. Fierce and shrill rose the yells of the Orcs, and suddenly the horn-calls ceased. Aragorn raced down the last slope, but before he could reach the hill's foot, the sounds died away; and as he turned to the left and ran towards them they retreated, until at last he could hear them no more. Drawing his bright sword and crying Elendil! Elendil! he crashed through the trees.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随着他急促的脚步，此起彼落的叫喊声开始渐渐变弱，号角声变得越来越紧急；半兽人的尖厉声音此起彼落，号角声却突然间沉默了。阿拉贡迈步飞奔冲下山坡，但是，在他抵达山脚之前，那叫喊声就开始渐渐变远。当他转向左，冲向这些声音的源头时，他可以听见那声音开始往远方撤退，最后化成一片死寂。他拔出圣剑，大喊着“伊兰迪尔！伊兰迪尔”！瞬间冲入树丛间。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A mile, maybe, from Parth Galen in a little glade not far from the lake he found Boromir. He was sitting with his back to a great tree, as if he was resting. But Aragorn saw that he was pierced with many black-feathered arrows; his sword was still in his hand, but it was broken near the hilt; his horn cloven in two was at his side. Many Orcs lay slain, piled all about him and at his feet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他在距离帕斯加兰不到一哩的草地上发现了波罗莫，他背靠着一株大树，仿佛正在休息。但是，阿拉贡注意到他浑身插满了黑羽箭；他手中虽然还紧握着宝剑，武器却已经连柄断折，他的号角也碎成两半，散落满地，许多半兽人的尸体横陈在他四周。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Aragorn knelt beside him. Boromir opened his eyes and strove to speak. At last slow words came. "I tried to take the Ring from Frodo " he said. "I am sorry. I have paid." His glance strayed to his fallen enemies; twenty at least lay there. "They have gone: the Halflings: the Orcs have taken them. I think they are not dead. Orcs bound them." He paused and his eyes closed wearily. After a moment he spoke again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿拉贡跪倒下来，波罗莫张开眼睛，挣扎着想要说话，最后，他终于挤出了几个字：“我试着从佛罗多手中夺走魔戒，”他说：“对不起，我罪有应得！”他的目光流连在倒下的敌人尸体上，这儿至少有二十具尸体。“哈比人已经被半兽人掳走了。我想他们还没死，半兽人把他们绑了起来。”他停了片刻，眼睛疲倦地开始闭上，又过了几秒钟，他继续道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He knelt for a while, bent with weeping, still clasping Boromir's hand. So it was that Legolas and Gimli found him. They came from the western slopes of the hill, silently, creeping through the trees as if they were hunting. Gimli had his axe in hand, and Legolas his long knife: all his arrows were spent. When they came into the glade they halted in amazement; and then they stood a moment with heads bowed in grief, for it seemed to them plain what had happened.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他泪流满面地发呆了片刻，当勒苟拉斯和金雳找到他时，他依旧紧握着波罗莫的手。他们从西方的山坡下来，静悄悄地如同狩猎一般穿越了树林，金雳手中握着斧头，勒苟拉斯背着空空如也的箭袋，手拿着小刀。当他们来到草地上时，一时之间楞在当场。两人不约而同低下头，为眼前的景象哀悼，他们都明白发生了什么事情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Alas!" said Legolas, coming to Aragorn's side. "We have hunted and slain many Orcs in the woods, but we should have been of more use here. We came when we heard the horn-but too late, it seems. I fear you have taken deadly hurt."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“早知如此，”勒苟拉斯走到阿拉贡的身边说：“我们在森林中辛苦杀死了许多半兽人，现在一看，才知道我们其实应该早点赶来这里。我们一听到号角声就赶了过来，但是已经太迟了…你还好吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Boromir is dead," said Aragorn. "I am unscathed, for I was not here with him. He fell defending the hobbits, while I was away upon the hill."</div>

<div class="line_en">"I do not know," answered Aragorn wearily. "Before he died Boromir told me that the Orcs had bound them; he did not think that they were dead.

<div class="line_en">"See!" cried Aragorn. "Here we find tokens!" He picked out from the pile of grim weapons two knives, leaf bladed, damasked in gold and red; and searching further he found also the sheaths, black, set with small red gems. "No orc tools these!" he said. "They were borne by the hobbits. Doubtless the Orcs despoiled them, but feared to keep the knives, knowing them for what they are: work of Westernesse, wound about with spells for the bane of Mordor. Well, now, if they still live, our friends are weaponless. I will take these things, hoping against hope, to give them back."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你们看！”阿拉贡说：“这是他们用的东西！”他从一堆破烂的武器中找出两柄叶状的短剑，剑柄上面缠绕着金色和红色的装饰；在仔细寻找了片刻之后，他又找到了两个黑色、上面有着小小红宝石的剑鞘。“这不是半兽人的东西！”他说：“这些是哈比人随身携带的武器，半兽人抓住了他们，但却不敢留下这些短剑，因为它们是西方皇族打造的，上面被注入了摧毁魔多之力的咒文。好吧，如果我们的朋友还活着，他们现在手无寸铁。让我先保管这些东西，只要不放弃最后一丝希望，我相信还是有机会把这些东西物归原主。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And I," said Legolas, "will take all the arrows that I can find, for my quiver is empty." He searched in the pile and on the ground about and found not a few that were undamaged and longer in the shaft than such arrows as the Orcs were accustomed to use. He looked at them closely.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“而我，”勒苟拉斯说：“会收起所有还可使用的箭矢，因为我的箭囊已经空了。”他在地上的武器堆中不停地搜寻着，找到一些箭身比较长、完好无损的半兽人箭矢，收到箭囊中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And Aragorn looked on the slain, and he said: "Here lie many that are not folk of Mordor. Some are from the North, from the Misty Mountains, if I know anything of Orcs and their kinds. And here are others strange to me. Their gear is not after the manner of Orcs at all!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿拉贡则是检查着地上的尸体，最后作出了结论：“这里有许多士兵并不是来自魔多，根据我对半兽人的了解，有些是从北方的迷雾山脉来的。这里还有一些更奇怪的状况，他们的装备完全不是半兽人惯用的！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There were four goblin soldiers of greater stature, swart, slant-eyed, with thick legs and large hands. They were armed with short broad bladed swords, not with the curved scimitars usual with Orcs: and they had bows of yew, in length and shape like the bows of Men. Upon their shields they bore a strange device: a small white hand in the centre of a black field; on the front of their iron helms was set an S rune, wrought of some white metal.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="地上躺着四名身材高大的半兽人士兵，他们眼睛细小、手脚都格外粗壮，他们身上配戴着刀锋宽大的短剑，不是一般半兽人爱用的弯刀；而且，他们的长弓是紫衫木做的，在形状和长度上都与人类惯用的接近。他们的盾牌上有着一个奇怪的徽记，在黑色背景中出现一只白色的手，在他们的头盔正面，有着用白色金属镶嵌的符文。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Neither does he use his right name, nor permit it to be spelt or spoken," said Aragorn. "And he does not use white. The Orcs in the service of Barad-dur use the sign of the Red Eye." He stood for a moment in thought. 'S is for Saruman, I guess," he said at length. "There is evil afoot in Isengard, and the West is no longer safe. It is as Gandalf feared: by some means the traitor Saruman has had news of our journey. It is likely too that he knows of Gandalf's fall. Pursuers from Moria may have escaped the vigilance of Lorien, or they may have avoided that land and come to Isengard by other paths. Orcs travel fast. But Saruman has many ways of learning news. Do you remember the birds?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“而且，他也不会使用我们称呼他的名字，更不可能准许属下将它拼出来，甚至是放在头盔上。”阿拉贡判断道：“况且，他绝不可能使用白色，巴拉多要塞的半兽人使用的徽记，是血红眼。”他沉思了片刻：“我猜这是代表萨鲁曼，”良久，他终于作出判断：“艾辛格中邪恶酝酿，西方已经不再安全。正如同甘道夫所担心的一样，萨鲁曼透过某种方法知道了我们的计划，他很有可能也知道甘道夫牺牲的消息。摩瑞亚的追兵可能躲过了罗瑞安的防守，或者是透过其它的路线到达了艾辛格，半兽人的脚程很快。不过，我想，萨鲁曼的情报来源绝对不只一个，你还记得在天空盘旋的那些飞鸟吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

They combed his long dark hair and arrayed it upon his shoulders. The golden belt of Lorien gleamed about his waist. His helm they set beside him, and across his lap they laid the cloven horn and the hilts and shards of his sword; beneath his feet they put the swords of his enemies.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then fastening the prow to the stern of the other boat, they drew him out into the water. They rowed sadly along the shore, and turning into the swift-running channel they passed the green sward of Parth Galen. The steep sides of Tol Brandir were glowing: it was now mid-afternoon. As they went south the fume of Rauros rose and shimmered before them, a haze of gold. The rush and thunder of the falls shook the windless air.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sorrowfully they cast loose the funeral boat: there Boromir lay, restful, peaceful, gliding upon the bosom of the flowing water. The stream took him while they held their own boat back with their paddles. He floated by them, and slowly his boat departed, waning to a dark spot against the golden light; and then suddenly it vanished. Rauros roared on unchanging. The River had taken Boromir son of Denethor, and he was not seen again in Minas Tirith, standing as he used to stand upon the White Tower in the morning. But in Gondor in after-days it long was said that the elven-boat rode the falls and the foaming pool, and bore him down through Osgiliath, and past the many mouths of Anduin, out into the Great Sea at night under the stars.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随着他们继续往南划，拉洛斯瀑布的水雾开始将他们包围，形成一片金色的迷雾。瀑布如同千军万马，奔腾的声响震动了附近静滞的空气。他们哀伤地松开了波罗莫遗体放置的小舟，让他安祥地在水面上漂浮；水流载着他缓缓远去，其它人则是划动着船桨保持在原地。小舟慢慢飘向瀑布，变成金光中的黑点，最后消失得无影无踪。拉洛斯瀑布依旧不变的发出怒吼声，大河接纳了英勇的波罗莫，从此，他再也不能够像过去一样，每天清晨登上米那斯提力斯的城墙，了望魔王的领土。不过，日后，刚铎流传着一个传说：这艘精灵的小舟载着他穿越了瀑布和大湖，经过奥斯吉力亚斯的河岸，从大河安都因入海，自此沐浴在黑暗海面上的星光拥抱中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Aragorn did not answer at once, but went back to the camping-place and looked at the baggage. "Two packs are missing." he said, "and one is certainly Sam's: it was rather large and heavy. This then is the answer: Frodo has gone by boat, and his servant has gone with him. Frodo must have returned while we were all away. I met Sam going up the hill and told him to follow me; but plainly he did not do so.
