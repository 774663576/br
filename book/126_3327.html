<div class="line_en">Late at night the door opened quietly, and Becky looked in. Her eyes were red from crying. "Oh, Miss," she said. "All the servants are talking about it. I'm so sorry -- so sorry!" She looked at Sara's white face, and began to cry again. Then she ran to Sara, and took her hand.</div>

<div class="line_en">That evening, in the little attic room, Sara sat on the bed in her old black dress. She did not cry, but her face was white and she did not move or speak for hours.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天晚上，萨拉穿着黑色的旧衣服，坐在阁楼上她那间狭小的房间的床上。她没有哭，可是脸色苍白，一连几个小时一动不动，也没有说话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The cook was a big woman with a red, angry face. "So," she said, "the little rich girl with the diamond mines is now a servant, eh?" She looked at Sara. "Now, I'm making apple pies this morning. Run down to the shops and get me some apples. And be quick!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="厨子是个大块头的女人，长着一张发红的脸，脸色凶巴巴的。“看吧，”她说，“家里有钻石矿的富家小姐现在成了仆人，嗯？”她看着萨拉，“好了，我今天早上要做苹果派。下楼到商店里给我买些苹果来。要快！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You speak French well," Miss Minchin said to her coldly. "So you can teach French to the younger children. But you're only a servant. Don't forget that."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你法语说得不错，”明钦小姐冷冷地对她说，“所以你可以给小孩子上法语课。但你仅仅是个仆人，别忘了这一点。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The first months of Sara's new life were very hard. She was always tired and hungry, but she never cried. At night, in her little attic, she thought about her father, dead in India all those miles away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="萨拉新生活的第一个月非常艰难。她常常感到又累又饿，可她从来没哭过。夜幕降临时，在阁楼上狭小的房间里，她想起了死在千万里之外遥远的印度的父亲。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The girls in the school were sorry for Sara, but Sara was a servant now, and they could not be friendly with a servant. Lavinia, of course, was pleased. "I never liked Sara Crewe," she told her friends. "And I was right about the diamonds -- there weren't any!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="学校里的姑娘们都为萨拉感到难过，可萨拉现在是个女仆了，她们不能跟仆人要好。当然拉维尼娅很是高兴。“我一直都不喜欢萨拉·克鲁，”她对她的伙伴们说，“我当初说那里没有什么钻石也没错——那里就是没有嘛！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ermengarde was very unhappy. When she saw Sara in the school, Sara walked past her and did not speak. Poor Ermengarde loved Sara and wanted to be friendly, but she was not clever, and she did not understand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃芒加德非常难过。她在校园里见到萨拉时，萨拉总是一句话不说就匆匆而过。可怜的埃芒加德非常喜欢萨拉，想跟她好。可脑筋并不怎么灵光的她却怎么也弄不懂萨拉为什么会这样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I do like you," Sara said. "Of course I do. But, you see, everything is different now. Miss Minchin doesn't want me to talk to the girls. Most of them don't want to talk to me. And I thought, perhaps, you didn't want to…"</div>
