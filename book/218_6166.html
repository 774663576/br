<div class="line_en">In 1974, Ray Kroc, the founder of McDonald's, was asked to speak to the MBA class at the University of Texas at Austin. A dear friend of mine, Keith Cunningham, was a student in that MBA class. After a powerful and inspiring talk, the class adjourned and the students asked Ray if he would join them at their favorite hangout to have a few beers. Ray graciously accepted.</div>

In their business plan, Ray knew that the primary business focus was to sell hamburger franchises, but what he never lost sight of was the location of each franchise.

Basically, the person that bought the franchise was also paying for, buying, the land under the franchise for Ray Kroc's organization.</div>

<div class="line_en">I assume most of us have filled out a credit application for a banker to buy a house or to buy a car. It is always interesting to look at the "net worth' section.

<div class="line_en">I cringe every time I hear someone say to me that their net worth is a million dollars or $100,000 dollars or whatever. One of the main reasons net worth is not accurate is simply because the moment you begin selling your assets, you are taxed for any gains.</div>

<div class="line_en">So many people have put themselves in deep financial trouble when they run short of income. To raise cash, they sell their assets. First, their personal assets can generally be sold for only a fraction of the value that is listed in their personal balance sheet. Or if there is a gain on the sale of the assets, they are taxed on the gain. So again, the government takes its share of the gain, thus reducing the amount available to help them out of debt. That is why I say someone's net worth is often "worth less" than they think.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以许多收入不足的人更容易陷入财务困境。为增加现金，他们不得不出售资产。首先，他们个人资产的卖价只是他们在资产负债表上列支数字的一小部分；其次如果有收益，他们还要交税，也就是说每卖一次，政府就会从他们的收益中拿走一份，从而减少了可用来帮助他们摆脱债务的现金。这就是我为什么说某人实际上的净资产要比他们自己认为的少得多的原因了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Start minding your own business. Keep your daytime job, but start buying real assets, not liabilities or personal effects that have no real value once you get them home. A new car loses nearly 25 percent of the price you pay for it the moment you drive it off the lot. It is not a true asset even if your banker lets you list it as one.

<div class="line_en">For adults, keep your expenses low, reduce your liabilities and diligently build a base of solid assets.

<div class="line_en">I love stocks of small companies, especially startups. The reason is that I am an entrepreneur, not a corporate person. In my early years. I worked in large organizations, such as Standard Oil of California, the U. S. Marine Corps, and Xerox Corp. I enjoyed my time with those organizations and have fond memories, but I know deep down I am not a company man. I like starting companies, not running them. So my slock buys are usually of small companies, and sometimes I even start the company and take it public. Fortunes are made in new-stock issues, and I love the game. Many people are afraid of small-cap companies and call them risky, and they are. But risk is always diminished if you love what the investment is, understand it and know the game. With small companies, my investment strategy is to be out of the stock in a year. My real estate strategy, on the other hand, is to start small and keep trading the properties up for bigger properties and, therefore, delaying paying taxes on the gain. This allows the value to increase dramatically. I generally hold real estate less than seven years.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我喜欢小公司的股票，尤其是刚成立的公司，原因是我是一个企业家而不是一个雇员。早年，我也曾在一些大机构工作，如加利福尼亚标准石油公司、美国海军陆战队和施乐公司，在这些机构做事给我留下了愉快的记忆。但我深知我不是个公司职员，我喜欢开办公司但不去经营它们，所以我买的股票都是小公司的。有时我甚至自己创办小公司并把它们上市，使财富从新股票的发行中产生。我喜爱这种游戏。许多人害怕小的、没名气的公司。认为它们风险大。小公司的风险是大，但是如果喜爱你所投资的对象，了解它并懂得游戏规则，风险就会减少。对于小公司，我的投资策略是：1年内脱手。另一方面我的房地产投资策略则是从小买卖开始并一点点做大，条件允许的话尽量晚一些出手，这样做的好处是可以推迟缴纳所得税，从而使资产可能戏剧般地增加。我通常持有房地产在7年以上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I would not encourage anyone to start a company unless they really want to. Knowing what I know about running a company, I would not wish that task on anyone. There are times when people cannot find employment, where starting a company is a solution for them. The odds are against success: Nine out of 10 companies fail in five years. Of those that survive the first five years, nine out of every 10 of those eventually fail, as well. So only if you really have the desire to own your own company do I recommend it. Otherwise, keep your daytime job and mind your own business.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我并不鼓励那些不想建立自己公司的人也去这么干，我也不希望每个人都去经营公司。不过，有时当人们无法找到工作时，开个公司倒是个解决的办法，但并不一定能获得成功：十家新公司有九家会在5年内倒闭，那些在头五年存活下来的公司又会有十分之九最终倒闭。所以只有当你的确愿意拥有自己的公司时，你再去做我建议的事。否则，继续上班的同时关注自己的事业吧。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As your cash flow grows, you can buy some luxuries. An important distinction is that rich people buy luxuries last, while the poor and middle class tend to buy luxuries first. The poor and the middle class often buy luxury items such as big houses, diamonds, furs, jewelry or boats because they want to look rich. They look rich, but in reality they just get deeper in debt on credit. The old-money people, the long-term rich, built their asset column first. Then, the income generated from the asset column bought their luxuries. The poor and middle class buy luxuries with their own sweat, blood and children's inheritance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当你的现金流增加时，你可以买点儿奢侈品，一个重要的区别是富人最后才买奢侈品，而穷人和中产阶级会先买下诸如大房子、珠宝、皮衣、宝石、游艇等奢侈品，因为他们想看上去很富有。他们看上去的确很富有，但实际上他们已深陷贷款的陷阱之中。那些总有钱的人，那些能长期富裕的人，是先建立他们的资产，然后才用资产所产生的收人购买奢侈品，穷人和中产阶级则用他们的血汗钱和将留给孩子们的遗产购买奢侈品。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When I say mind your own business, I mean to build and keep your asset column strong. Once a dollar goes into it, never let it come out. Think of it this way, once a dollar goes into your asset column, it becomes your employee.</div>

<div class="line_en">A true luxury is a reward for investing in and developing a real asset. For example, when my wife and I had extra money coming from our apartment houses, she went out and bought her Mercedes. It did not take any extra work or risk on her part because the apartment house bought the car. She did, however, have to wait for it for four years while the real estate investment portfolio grew and finally began throwing off enough extra cash flow to pay for the car. But the luxury, the Mercedes, was a true reward because she had proved she knew how to grow her asset column. That car now means a lot more to her than simply another pretty car. It means she used her financial intelligence to afford it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="真正的奢侈品是对投资和积累真正资产的奖励。例如，当我和妻子通过买卖房屋获得了额外收人时，她去买了辆奔驰，这不是增加她的工作或冒着风险买下的。然而，当房地产投资升值并最终有足够的现金流人足以购买这辆车之前，她等了4年的时间。这奢侈品的确是个奖励，因为它证明了她知道如何增加自己的资产，那辆车对她的意义已不仅是一辆车，而意味着她能用自己的财务知识得到它。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After you've taken the time and invested in and built your own business, you are now ready to add the magic touch -- the biggest secret of the rich. The secret that puts the rich way ahead of the pack. The reward at the end of the road for diligently taking the time to mind your own business.</div>

<div class="line_en">What most people do is they impulsively go out and buy a new car, or some other luxury, on credit. They may feel bored and just want a new toy. Buying a luxury on credit often causes a person to sooner or later actually resent that luxury because the debt on the luxury becomes a financial burden.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大多数人所做的则是冲动地用贷款去买辆新车或其他奢侈品，他们可能厌烦了，所以期待有点新玩艺儿。用贷款买奢侈品会使人们迟早放弃那东西，因为买奢侈品借的债是个大负担。">查看中文翻译</div>
