<div class="line_en">The first time she left her chamber was at the commencement of the following March. Mr Linton had put on her pillow, in the morning, a handful of golden crocuses; her eye, long stranger to any gleam of pleasure, caught them in waking, and shone delighted as she gathered them eagerly together.</div>

<div class="line_en">For two months the fugitives remained absent; in those two months, Mrs Linton encountered and conquered the worst shock of what was denominated a brain fever. No mother could have nursed an only child more devotedly than Edgar tended her. Day and night he was watching, and patiently enduring all the annoyances that irritable nerves and a shaken reason could inflict; and, though Kenneth remarked that what he saved from the grave would only recompense his care by forming the source of constant future anxiety -- in fact, that his health and strength were being sacrificed to preserve a mere ruin of humanity -- he knew no limits in gratitude and joy when Catherine's life was declared out of danger; and hour after hour he would sit beside her, tracing the gradual return to bodily health, and flattering his too sanguine hopes with the illusion that her mind would settle back to its right balance also, and she would soon be entirely her former self.</div>

<div class="line_en">Linton lavished on her the kindest caresses, and tried to cheer her by the fondest words; but, vaguely regarding the flowers, she let the tears collect on her lashes and stream down her cheeks unheeding. We knew she was really better, and, therefore, decided that long confinement to a single place produced much of this despondency, and it might be partially removed by a change of scene. The master told me to light a fire in the many-weeks-deserted parlour, and to set an easy chair in the sunshine by the window; and then he brought her down, and she sat a long while enjoying the genial heat, and, as we expected, revived by the objects round her: which, though familiar, were free from the dreary associations investing her hated sick chamber. By evening, she seemed greatly exhausted; yet no arguments could persuade her to return to that apartment, and I had to arrange the parlour sofa for her bed, till another room could be prepared. To obviate the fatigue of mounting and descending the stairs, we fitted up this, where you lie at present: on the same floor with the parlour; and she was soon strong enough to move from one to the other, leaning on Edgar's arm. Ah, I thought myself she might recover, so waited on as she was. And there was double cause to desire it, for on her existence depended that of another: we cherished the hope that in a little while, Mr Linton's heart would be gladdened, and his lands secured from a stranger's gripe, by the birth of an heir.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="林惇在她身上不惜施以最温柔的爱抚，而且用最亲昵的话想使她高兴。可是，她茫然地望着花，眼泪聚在睫毛上，顺着她的双颊直淌，她也未在意。我们知道她是真的好些了，因此，确信她是由于长期关闭在一个地方才产生出这种沮丧的情绪，要是换一个地方，也许会消除一些的。主人叫我在那好几个星期没人进出的客厅里燃起炉火来，搬一把舒服的椅子放在窗口阳光下，然后把她抱下楼来。她坐了很久，享受着舒适的温暖。如我们所料，她四周的一切使她活泼起来了：这些东西虽然是熟悉的，却摆脱了笼罩着她那可厌的病床的那些凄凉的联想。晚上，看来她精疲力尽，但是没法劝她回卧房去，我只得在还没有布置好另一间屋子的时候，先把客厅沙发铺好作为她的床。为了不必上下楼太累，我们收拾了这间，就是你现在躺着的这间——跟客厅在同一层。不久她又好一点，可以靠在埃德加臂上从这间走到那间了。啊，我自己也想，她得到这样的服侍，是会复原的。而且有双重的原因希望她复原，因为另一个生命也倚仗她的生存而生存；我们都暗暗地希望林惇先生的心不久就会快乐起来，而他的土地，由于继承人的诞生，将不至于被一个陌生人夺去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I came last night to Wuthering Heights, and heard, for the first time, that Catherine has been, and is yet, very ill. I must not write to her, I suppose, and my brother is either too angry or too distressed to answer what I sent him. Still, I must write to somebody, and the only choice left me is you.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="昨天晚上我来到呼啸山庄，这才头一回听到凯瑟琳曾经，而且现在还是病得很厉害。我想我千万不能给她写信，我哥哥不是太生气，就是太难过，以至于不回我写给他的信。可是，我一定要给个什么人写封信，留给我唯一的对象就是你了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I should mention that Isabella sent to her brother, some six weeks from her departure, a short note, announcing her marriage with Heathcliff. It appeared dry and cold; but at the bottom was dotted in with pencil an obscure apology, and an entreaty for kind remembrance and reconciliation, if her proceeding had offended him: asserting that she could not help it then, and being done, she had now no power to repeal it. Linton did not reply to this, I believe; and, in a fortnight more, I got a long letter which I considered odd, coming from the pen of a bride just out of the honeymoon. I'll read it: for I keep it yet. Any relic of the dead is precious, if they were valued living.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这儿我应该提一提伊莎贝拉在她走后六个星期左右，寄了一封短信给她哥哥，宣布她跟希刺克厉夫结婚了。信写得似乎冷淡乏味，可是在下面用铅笔写了隐晦的道歉的话，而且说如果她的行为得罪了他，就恳求他原谅与和解：说她当时没法不这样作，事已如此，现在她也无法反悔。我相信林惇没回这封信。过了两个多星期，我收到一封长信，这信出自一个刚过完蜜月的新娘的笔下，我认为很古怪。现在我来把它念一遍，因为我还留着它呢。死人的任何遗物都是珍贵的，如果他们生前就被人重视的话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The sun set behind the Grange, as we turned on to the moors; by that, I judged it to be six o'clock; and my companion halted half an hour, to inspect the park, and the gardens, and, probably, the place itself, as well as he could; so it was dark when we dismounted in the paved yard of the farmhouse, and your old fellow-servant, Joseph, issued out to receive us by the light of a dip candle. He did it with a courtesy that redounded to his credit. His first act was to elevate his torch to a level with my face, squint malignantly, project his under lip, and turn away. Then he took the two horses, and led them into the stables; reappearing for the purpose of locking the outer gate, as if we lived in an ancient castle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在我们向旷野走去时，太阳已经落在田庄后面了。根据这一点，我想该是六点钟了。我的同伴停留了半小时，检查着果树园，花园，还有，也许就是这地方本身，尽可能不放过任何一处，因此当我们在田舍的铺了石子的院子下马时，天已经黑了。你的老同事，仆人约瑟夫，借着烛光出来接我们。他以一种足以给他面子增光的礼貌来接待我们。他的第一个动作就是把烛火向上举得和我的脸平齐，恶毒地斜瞅一眼，撇着他的下唇，就转身走开了。随后他牵着两匹马，把它们带到马厩里去，又重新出现，目的是锁外面大门，仿佛我们住在一座古代堡垒里一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

I questioned with myself -- where must I turn for comfort? and -- mind you don't tell Edgar, or Catherine -- above every sorrow beside, this rose pre-eminent: despair at finding nobody who could or would be my ally against Heathcliff!

I inquired whether I might call the maid, and be conducted to a bedroom? Mr Earnshaw vouchsafed no answer.

There was a carpet: a good one, but the pattern was obliterated by dust; a fireplace hung with cut paper, dropping to pieces; a handsome oak bedstead with ample crimson curtains of rather expensive material and modern make; but they had evidently experienced rough usage: the valances hung in festoons, wrenched from their rings, and the iron rod supporting them was bent in an arc on one side, causing the drapery to trail upon the floor.
