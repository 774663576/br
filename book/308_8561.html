<div class="line_en">I was puzzled. For the first time I was absolutely at sea as to Poirot's meaning. For a moment I was inclined to think that the scene I had just witnessed was a gigantic piece of bombast -- that he had been what he called "playing the comedy" with a view to making himself interesting and important. But, in spite of myself, I was forced to believe in an underlying reality. There had been real menace in his words -- a certain indisputable sincerity. But I still believed him to be on entirely the wrong tack.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此刻我很迷惑，第一次对波洛的用意彻底摸不到头脑。刚才这一幕估计又是波洛虚张声势的布局——按他的说法，“一出喜剧”——令人觉得他既有趣又掌控着大局。尽管如此，刚才的场面却逼真得令我不得不信。他话中的威慑力显而易见，态度也真诚得不容置疑。可是我仍然觉得，他的推理方向全错了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“估计你想让他相信，你已经查明一切，从而引蛇出洞，逼他主动出击——倒未必是俯首认罪。说不定他会抢在明天早上你通报警督之前设法封住你的嘴——正如他一劳永逸地让艾克罗伊德先生闭嘴那样。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Now, to begin with, there were two facts and a little discrepancy in time which especially attracted my attention. The first fact was the telephone call.

<div class="line_en">"Tres bien. The affair marches, does it not? But matters were still obscure. What was the advantage of having the crime discovered that night in preference to the following morning?

<div class="line_cn" title="“遮住窗户！”我迅速反应过来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You, too, have my first idea. I imagined that the chair was drawn out so that something connected with the window should not be seen by anyone entering through the door. But I soon abandoned that supposition, for though the chair was a grandfather with a high back, it obscured very little of the window -- only the part between the sash and the ground. No, mon ami -- but remember that just in front of the window there stood a table with books and magazines upon it. Now that table was completely hidden by the drawn-out chair -- and immediately I had my first shadowy suspicion of the truth."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你和我最初的想法一样。我原以为拖出椅子可以挡住窗口的某件东西，以防止从门口进来的人看到它。但很快我就推翻了这一假设。因为这把老式椅子的靠背虽然很高，但也只能挡住很小一部分窗户——仅仅是窗口与地面之间的那一部分而已。不，我的朋友——还记得吗，窗前摆着一张书桌，桌上堆放着书籍和杂志。而这把椅子被拖出来之后，便完全遮住了桌子——转瞬间，我隐约窥到了真相的一角。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Supposing that there had been something on that table not intended to be seen? Something placed there by the murderer? As yet I had no inkling of what that something might be. But I knew certain very interesting facts about it."</div>

<div class="line_en">For instance, it was something that the murderer had not been able to take away with him at the time that he committed the crime. At the same time it was vital that it should be removed as soon as possible after the crime had been discovered. And so -- the telephone message, and the opportunity for the murderer to be on the spot when the body was discovered.</div>

<div class="line_en">Parker I eliminated at once, since at whatever time the crime was discovered, he was the one person certain to be on the spot. Also it was he who told me of the pulled-out chair. Parker, then, was cleared (of the murder, that is. I still thought it possible that he had been blackmailing Mrs Ferrars). Raymond and Blunt, however, remained under suspicion since, if the crime had been discovered in the early hours of the morning, it was quite possible that they might have arrived on the scene too late to prevent the object on the round table being discovered."</div>

So, if something was taken from the table -- why should not that something be the dictaphone? But there were certain difficulties in the way. The attention of everyone was, of course, focused on the murdered man. I think anyone could have gone to the table unnoticed by the other people in the room. But a dictaphone has a certain bulk -- it cannot be slipped casually into a pocket. There must have been a receptacle of some kind capable of holding it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们知道艾克罗伊德先生已经买下一台口述录音机，但他的遗物中却没有这台机器的踪迹。因此，如果桌上有东西被人拿走的话——难道不就是口述录音机吗？可是，要带走这东西有一定困难。虽然所有人的注意力当时都集中在死者身上，任何人应该都有可能在不引起别人注意的情况下接近书桌，但一台口述录音机的体积可相当大，不是随随便便可以塞进口袋的。必须有一个足够装得下它的容器才行。”">查看中文翻译</div>

But the inmates of the house had shoes soled with crepe rubber, and I declined to believe in the coincidence of someone from outside having the same kind of shoes as Ralph Paton wore. Charles Kent, as we know from the barmaid of the Dog and Whistle, had on a pair of boots "clean dropping off him."</div>

<div class="line_en">"You know the result of her investigations. Ralph Paton had had a pair of boots with him. The first question I asked him when he came to my house yesterday morning was what he was wearing on his feet on the fatal night. He replied at once that he had worn boots -- he was still wearing them, in fact -- having nothing else to put on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“她的调查结果你也知道了。拉尔夫·佩顿果然随身带了一双靴子。昨天早晨他刚到我家，我问的第一个问题就是：案发当晚他穿的是什么鞋。他不假思索地回答说自己穿的是靴子——事实上那双靴子依然在他脚上——他也没其他鞋可穿了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">(3) Those prints were made by someone deliberately trying to throw suspicion on Ralph Paton. To test this last conclusion, it was necessary to ascertain certain facts. One pair of Ralph's shoes had been obtained from the Three Boars by the police. Neither Ralph nor anyone else could have worn them that evening, since they were downstairs being cleaned. According to the police theory, Ralph was wearing another pair of the same kind, and I found out that it was true that he had two pairs. Now for my theory to be proved correct it was necessary for the murderer to have worn Ralph's shoes that evening -- in which case Ralph must have been wearing yet a third pair of footwear of some kind. I could hardly suppose that he would bring three pairs of shoes all alike -- the third pair of footwear were more likely to be boots. I got your sister to make inquiries on this point -- laying some stress on the colour, in order -- I admit it frankly -- to obscure the real reason for my asking.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="三、那些鞋印是某人故意留下的，目的是嫁祸于拉尔夫·佩顿。为了验证最后这个推论，有必要先查清某些事实。警方从‘三只野猪’拿到了一双拉尔夫的鞋，无论拉尔夫还是别人，那天晚上都不可能穿过它，因为鞋底很干净。警方的观点是，拉尔夫穿着另一双同样的鞋，而我也查出他的确有两双这种鞋。那么按照我的思路，凶手当晚穿了拉尔夫的鞋——如此一来，拉尔夫肯定穿了另外一双鞋。很难想象他会带三双同样类型的鞋——这第三双更可能是靴子。我请你姐姐去调查这个问题——坦白说，我特意将重点放在靴子的颜色上，以掩盖我的真正意图。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Let us recapitulate -- now that all is clear. A person who was at the Three Boars earlier that day, a person who knew Ackroyd well enough to know that he had purchased a dictaphone, a person who was of a mechanical turn of mind, who had the opportunity to take the dagger from the silver table before Miss Flora arrived, who had with him a receptacle suitable for hiding the dictaphone -- such as a black bag, and who had the study to himself for a few minutes after the crime was discovered while Parker was telephoning for the police.
