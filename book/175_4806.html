<div class="line_en">The room was in semigloom, for Scarlett had pulled down the shades to shut out the heat and brightness. Pin points of sunlight came in through minute holes in the shades and about the edges. The room was an oven and Scarlett's sweat-drenched clothes never dried but became wetter and stickier as the hours went by. Prissy was crouched in a corner, sweating too, and smelled so abominably Scarlett would have sent her from the room had she not feared the girl would take to her heels if once out of sight. Melanie lay on the bed on a sheet dark with perspiration and splotched with dampness where Scarlett had spilled water. She twisted endlessly, to one side, to the other, to left, to right and back again.</div>

<div class="line_en">There would never again be an afternoon as long as this one. Or as hot. Or as full of lazy insolent flies. They swarmed on Melanie despite the fan Scarlett kept in constant motion. Her arms ached from swinging the wide palmetto leaf. All her efforts seemed futile, for while she brushed them from Melanie's moist face, they crawled on her clammy feet and legs and made her jerk them weakly and cry: "Please! On my feet!"</div>

<div class="line_en">She fervently wished she had paid more attention to the whispered conversations of matrons on the subject of childbirth. If only she had! If only she had been more interested in such matters she'd know whether Melanie was taking a long time or not. She had a vague memory of one of Aunt Pitty's stories of a friend who was in labor for two days and died without ever having the baby. Suppose Melanie should go on like this for two days! But Melanie was so delicate. She couldn't stand two days of this pain. She'd die soon if the baby didn't hurry. And how could she ever face Ashley, if he were still alive, and tell him that Melanie had died -- after she had promised to take care of her?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她真后悔自己以前没有多注意听听那些主妇们谈生孩子的事。要是平时注意到就好了！要是平时多关心这种事情，她现在就会知道媚兰是不是要很久才能生下来。她隐约记得皮蒂姑妈讲过，她的一个朋友生孩子整整整生了两天，结果没生出来自己就死了。说不定媚兰也得生两天呢！可是媚兰身体这样娇弱，她一定经不起两天的折磨。她很快就会死的。要是孩子不早些下来，如果艾希礼还活着，她怎么有脸去告诉他媚兰已经死了——她曾经答应过要照顾她呀！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As the afternoon wore on, Melanie moaned whether she wanted to be brave or not, and sometimes she screamed. When she did, Scarlett dropped her head into her hands and covered her ears and twisted her body and wished that she herself were dead. Anything was preferable to being a helpless witness to such pain. Anything was better than being tied here waiting for a baby that took such a long time coming. Waiting, when for all she knew the Yankees were actually at Five Points.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到了后来，就由不得媚兰自己要不要逞强，她终于呻吟起来，有时也大声叫了。她一叫，思嘉便双手捧着头，捂着耳朵，转过身去，巴不得自己死了。做什么都好，就是不要眼睁睁地看着这种痛苦的情景而毫无办法啊。要守在这里，花这么长时间等一个孩子落地，世界上没有比这更倒霉的事了。何况这样等着等着的时候，她很清楚北方佬实际上已经到五点镇了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sometimes she tried to sit up and fell back and began twisting again. At first, she had tried to keep from crying out, biting her lips until they were raw, and Scarlett, whose nerves were as raw as the lips, said huskily: "Melly, for God's sake, don't try to be brave. Yell if you want to. There's nobody to hear you but us."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有时她挣扎着想坐起来，但向后一靠又躺倒了，于是又打起滚来。最初她还强忍着不叫不嚷，狠狠咬着嘴唇，直咬得皮都破了。这时思嘉的神经也快要绷裂了，才粗声嘎气地说：“媚兰，看在上帝份上，别逞强了吧。除了我们没有别人能听见呢。想叫就叫吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“请说说话吧，对我说说话吧，”她低声说，这时思嘉便随意闲聊一阵，直到媚兰又抓住那个毛巾结开始扭摆起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At first, Melanie wanted to hold Scarlett's hand when the pain was bad but she clamped down on it so hard she nearly broke the bones. After an hour of this, Scarlett's hands were so swollen and bruised she could hardly flex them. She knotted two long towels together and tied them to the foot of the bed and put the knotted end in Melanie's hands. Melanie hung onto it as though it were a life line, straining, pulling it taut, slackening it, tearing it. Throughout the afternoon, her voice went on like an animal dying in a trap. Occasionally she dropped the towel and rubbed her hands feebly and looked up at Scarlett with eyes enormous with pain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="起初，媚兰疼得厉害时总是要把握住思嘉的手，但是她抓得那么紧，几乎要把骨头都捏碎了。一个钟头以后，思嘉的手就青肿起来，快要不能动弹了。她只得拿两条毛巾扎在一起，系在床腿上，然后让媚兰的两只手拉住打结的那一头。媚兰拉着它就像拉着自己的生命线似的，时而紧张地拽住，时而放松一下，随意地撒扯着。整个下午，她的声音像落在陷井里垂死的野兽一般在嗥叫。她偶尔放下毛巾，无力地搓着双手，瞪着两只痛得鼓鼓的眼睛仰望着思嘉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The dim room swam with heat and pain and droning flies, and time went by on such dragging feet Scarlett could scarcely remember the morning. She felt as if she had been in this steaming, dark, sweating place all her life. She wanted very much to scream every time Melanie did, and only by biting her lips so hard it infuriated her could she restrain herself and drive off hysteria.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="房间里又暗又热，充满了痛苦的喊叫和嗡嗡的苍蝇，可是时间过得慢极了，思嘉连早晨的事也有点记不起来了。她觉得仿佛自己在这个闷热、阴沉和汗湿的地方已待了一辈子似的。每当媚兰喊叫时她也很想喊叫，只是由于狠命地死咬着嘴唇不放才没有喊叫出来，并终于把内心的狂乱遏制下去了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The clock on the mantel had stopped and she had no way of telling the time but as the heat in the room lessened and the bright pin points of light grew duller, she pulled the shade aside. She saw to her surprise that it was late afternoon and the sun, a ball of crimson, was far down the sky. Somehow, she had imagined it would remain broiling hot noon forever.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="壁炉上的钟已经停摆，她已没法知道现在是什么时候，只有等到房里的热气渐消和那一点一点亮光暗淡下去时，她才把窗帘拉开，猛地发现原来快傍晚了，太阳像个猩红的火球已远远斜挂在西天。不知为什么，她原以为永远是酷热的中午呢。">查看中文翻译</div>

Then she remembered with a sick dropping in her stomach how few Confederates there were and how many men Sherman had and how well fed they were. Sherman! The name of Satan himself did not frighten her half so much. But there was no time for thinking now, as Melanie called for water, for a cold towel on her head, to be fanned, to have the flies brushed away from her face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她紧张地猜想现在商业区已经变成什么样子。是不是军队已经全部撤出去了？北方佬进来了没有？联盟军会不经过战斗就开走吗？于是，她不由得十分遗憾和沮丧地想起，联盟军为数那么少，而谢尔曼的部队又多又强壮，谢尔曼啊！连撒旦本人也不会像他这样叫人害怕呢！可现在已没有时间来想这些了，因为媚兰在喊着要水，要一块湿毛巾敷在她头上，要人给她打扇，要人驱赶她脸上的苍蝇。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When twilight came on and Prissy, scurrying like a black wraith, lit a lamp, Melanie became weaker. She began calling for Ashley, over and over, as if in a delirium until the hideous monotony gave Scarlett a fierce desire to smother her voice with a pillow. Perhaps the doctor would come after all. If he would only come quickly! Hope raising its head, she turned to Prissy, and ordered her to run quickly to the Meades' house and see if he were there or Mrs. Meade.</div>

<div class="line_en">Scarlett came down the dark stairs slowly, like an old woman, feeling her way, clinging to the banisters lest she fall. Her legs were leaden, trembling with fatigue and strain, and she shivered with cold from the clammy sweat that soaked her body. Feebly she made her way onto the front porch and sank down on the top step. She sprawled back against a pillar of the porch and with a shaking hand unbuttoned her basque halfway down her bosom. The night was drenched in warm soft darkness and she lay staring into it, dull as an ox.</div>

<div class="line_en">She heard her own breath pass from loud evenness to spasmodic sobbing but her eyes were dry and burning as though there would never be tears in them again. Slowly, laboriously, she heaved herself over and pulled her heavy skirts up to her thighs. She was warm and cold and sticky all at the same time and the feel of the night air on her limbs was refreshing. She thought dully what Aunt Pitty would say, if she could see her sprawled here on the front porch with her skirts up and her drawers showing, but she did not care. She did not care about anything. Time had stood still. It might be just after twilight and it might be midnight. She didn't know or care.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她听见她自己的呼吸声从均匀响亮转为痉挛性的抽泣，但她的眼睛是干枯而火辣辣的，仿佛它们再也不会流泪了。她缓慢而吃力地抬起身来，将沉重的裙裾拉到大腿以上。她同时感到又冷又热又模模糊糊，而微微的夜风吹在四肢上却爽快得很。她模糊地感到，如果皮蒂姑妈看见她斜躺在这前廊上，裙子撩得那么高，连内裤都露了出来，不知要怎么说呢。不过她不管它。她什么也不管了。时间已停滞不前。现在可能刚过黄昏不久，也可能已经半夜了。她不清楚，也不去管它。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was all over. Melanie was not dead and the small baby boy who made noises like a young kitten was receiving his first bath at Prissy's hands. Melanie was asleep. How could she sleep after that nightmare of screaming pain and ignorant midwifery that hurt more than it helped? Why wasn't she dead? Scarlett knew that she herself would have died under such handling. But when it was over, Melanie had even whispered, so weakly she had to bend over her to hear: "Thank you." And then she had gone to sleep. How could she go to sleep? Scarlett forgot that she too had gone to sleep after Wade was born. She forgot everything. Her mind was a vacuum; the world was a vacuum; there had been no life before this endless day and there would be none hereafter -- only a heavily hot night, only the sound of her hoarse tired breathing, only the sweat trickling coldly from armpit to waist, from hip to knee, clammy, sticky, chilling.</div>

After a long interval in which her breathing finally quieted and her mind steadied, Scarlett heard the sound of faint voices from up the road, the tramping of many feet coming from the north. Soldiers! She sat up slowly, pulling down her skirts, although she knew no one could see her in the darkness.

<div class="line_en">Suddenly she thought of Rhett Butler and calm dispelled her fears. Why hadn't she thought of him this morning when she had been tearing about like a chicken with its head off? She hated him, but he was strong and smart and he wasn't afraid of the Yankees. And he was still in town. Of course, she was mad at him. But she could overlook such things at a time like this. And he had a horse and carriage, too. Oh, why hadn't she thought of him before! He could take them all away from this doomed place, away from the Yankees, somewhere, anywhere.</div>
