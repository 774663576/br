<div class="line_en">If you are currently in therapy, I suggest you encourage your therapist to do this work with you. This particular treatment process has a beginning, a middle, and an end. The roadmap is specific and clearly marked. If you follow it, you will reclaim your dignity and self-respect.</div>

<div class="line_en">I know that some therapists and incest clients prefer the term incest survivor to the term incest victim, and that's fine. But for me, incest victim is a more accurate description of the individual's experience. I am certainly sympathetic to this semantic attempt to ease the pain, as long as the word survivor is not used to deny how much work needs to be done.</div>

<div class="line_en">Those who are trained in family dynamics, and who use action-oriented techniques such as role playing, make the best therapists for incest victims. Freudian psychiatrists make the worst, because Freud significantly reversed his original (and accurate) positions on both the prevalence and the damage of incest; as a result, many Freudian psychiatrists and psychoanalysts meet their patients' accounts of childhood sexual abuse with skepticism or disbelief.</div>

<div class="line_en">CHOOSING A THERAPIST</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It is important to shop for a therapist specifically educated or experienced in working with incest victims. Many therapists are unqualified in this highly specialized area, and virtually no therapists learn anything about incest in graduate school. Question each prospective therapist about his or her special training and experience. If he or she has not worked with incest victims before or has not attended any workshops, seminars, conferences, or classes on incest treatment, I suggest you find someone else.</div>

<div class="line_en">INDIVIDUAL OR GROUP THERAPY</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The best way to work through the incest experience is to join a group made up of victims like yourself led by a therapist who is experienced and comfortable with the issue.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the last decade many self-help groups for incest victims have been formed around the country. While these groups do provide some support and a sense of community to many incest victims, they lack the guidance of a therapist with the expertise to provide structure and direction for the work. A self-help group is better than no group at all, but it's far better to be in a group led by a professional.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One almost universal symptom of incest is a feeling of total isolation. But when you're surrounded by people talking about feelings and experiences that sound just like yours, the isolation begins to fade. Group members nurture and support you. In essence, they say: "We know how it feels, we believe you, we hurt for you, we care about you, we want you to be the best you can."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There are very few people who do not thrive in group, although most people are apprehensive about it at first. You may feel tense and self-conscious about talking about "it" in front of other people. Believe me, those feelings usually last no more than ten minutes.</div>

<div class="line_en">THE FIRST TIME IN GROUP</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The incest therapy groups at my treatment center are open-ended. This means that a new member can enter at any time. It also means that someone who is just beginning this work will be in group with people at different stages of progress. It's wonderfully encouraging for a new group member to see someone ready to graduate and leave the incest experience behind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This initiation helps break the ice so that you can join the group in an active way. You will find yourself talking about your experience in detail for perhaps the first time. You will see that you are not alone, that other people have experienced similar traumas.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When a new client comes into group, we begin the session with an initiation exercise in which every group member tells about his or her incest experience: who it was with, what it involved, when it began, how long it went on, and who else knows about it. The new member goes last.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A small number of incest victims are too emotionally fragile to handle the intensity of group. For them, one-to-one therapy is the alternative.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I always put male and female victims together in group. The gender may be different, but the feelings and traumas are the same.</div>

</div>
</div>
<div class="line_en">Your initiation will also continue the vital process of desensitization to the trauma for the other group members. Every time a new member is initiated, group members must repeat what has long been unspoken. The more often this happens, the more everyone in the group is desensitized to the shame and the guilt. The first time through is very difficult for any new member. There is a great deal of weeping and embarrassment. By the third or fourth time the experiences become easier to talk about, and the embarrassment subsides noticeably. By the time someone has told his or her story ten or twelve times, it is not much more difficult than talking about any other unhappy life event.</div>

<div class="line_en">Stages of Treatment</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Outrage is the deep anger that arises from feelings of violation and betrayal of the very core of one's being. It is the first essential part of this work and the most difficult.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I take incest victims through three basic stages: outrage, grief, and release.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Most adults who were molested as children have had plenty of practice at feeling sad, lonely, and bad. Grief is familiar to them, but outrage is not. As a result, they often try to skip over their outrage and move on to grief as quickly as possible. This is a mistake. Outrage must precede grief. Of course, it is impossible to keep intense feelings totally separate -- there is grief in outrage and outrage in grief. But for the purpose of this work, they are distinct stages.</div>

<span class="curr_page">7</span> / <span>42</span>
</div>
</div>
<div class="line_en">For many of you, this is easier said than done. You've spent years keeping the lid on. You may have repressed your outrage so effectively that you've become a submissive, self-sacrificing perfectionist. It's as if you've been saying, "I'm not damaged and I can prove it by being perfect. I sacrifice everything for others, I don't get angry, and I do as I'm told." Releasing your outrage is like uncapping a volcano. The resulting eruption may feel overwhelming.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In order to put the responsibility firmly where it belongs, you must acknowledge your outrage and learn, in the safety of therapy, to let it out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For others, the problem isn't how to get in touch with their outrage, it's how to control it. You may seethe with outrage at everyone around you except those at whom you're really angry -- your parents. You may have a perpetual chip on your shoulder, displacing your outrage from your parents to whomever happens to come along. You may act so tough and belligerent that you scare people away.</div>

<div class="line_en">THE VICTIM'S OUTRAGE</div>

<div class="line_en">RELEASE AND EMPOWERMENT</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">During the healing process, you're going to actively grieve over many losses -- the loss of the "good family" fantasy, of innocence, of love, of childhood, of years that might otherwise have been happy and productive. This grief may overwhelm you. Your therapist must have the courage and the experience to lead you through it and bring you out the other end. As with any grief, there are no easy ways around it, no shortcuts.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the last stage of treatment, when you have exhausted your outrage and your grief, you will learn to take the energy they were consuming and use it to rebuild your life and your self-image. By this time, many of your symptoms will have either diminished significantly or become manageable. You'll have a new dignity and a new sense of yourself as a valuable and lovable person. You will be faced with a new option for the first time in your life -- that of no longer feeling or behaving like a victim.</div>

<div class="line_en">Treatment Techniques</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The two primary techniques I use for treating clients are letter writing and role playing. I have also designed a number of group exercises that have proved especially helpful for incest victims and other adult children of toxic parents. These techniques can be used in both individual and group therapy. Since only a small percentage of the incest therapy at my treatment centers is done on an individual basis, I've selected my examples from group sessions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Letters</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I ask every group member to write one letter a week, especially in the beginning. They write these letters at home, then read them aloud to the group. Although no one is required to mail their letters, many group members choose to, especially when they begin to feel stronger. I ask my clients to write their letters in the following order:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">to the aggressor (s)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">to the other parent (assuming that one parent was the aggressor; adults who were molested by a family member other than a parent need to write first to the aggressor and then to each parent)</div>

<div class="line_en">to each of your children</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the first letter -- to the aggressor -- I want you to let it all out, to get as outraged as you can. Use phrases like "how dare you…" and "how could you…" as often as possible. These phrases will make it easier for you to contact your outrage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">to your partner or lover (if you have one)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After this series of letters is completed, I ask my group members to begin the series again. In this way the letters become not only powerful tools for healing but clear barometers of progress. A letter written during the first few weeks of therapy will be very different, in both tone and content, from a letter written three or four months later.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When I first met Janine, a gentle, petite, blond 36-year-old, she rarely spoke above a whisper. Her father had molested her from the time she was 7 until she was 11-- but Janine was still clinging to the hope that she could somehow win his love. She was especially reluctant to acknowledge her inner rage at him. She wept through her initiation and was noticeably uncomfortable when I asked her to write her father a letter. I encouraged her to use her letter to get outraged at how her father had hurt and betrayed her. I reminded her that her father didn't ever have to see this letter.</div>

In her first letter to her father, Connie's feelings spilled haphazardly across the page, without boundaries, without form.

<div class="line_en">Connie's letter to her mother offers a poignant example of the tremendous ambivalence most incest victims feel toward their mothers.

<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">If you think your mother did know about the incest, or if you actually told her while it was going on, there is an enormous amount of outrage that you need to express to her: outrage for the lack of protection, for being disbelieved or blamed, for having been used as a sacrificial lamb to keep a destructive marriage and a destructive family intact, and outrage at having been less important to your mother than her need for financial security or maintaining the status quo.</div>

Peace with him was so damned important to you that you sacrificed me to him. It hurt so much to know that I wasn't important enough to protect. It hurt so much that I shut my pain away. I can't even feel things like a normal person. My parents not only stole my childhood, they stole my emotions, too. I hate and love you so much that I'm really confused. Why didn't you take care of me, Mommy? Why didn't you just love me? What was wrong with me? Will I ever get any answers?</div>

<div class="line_en">Dear Little Dan,</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">You were a beautiful child, an innocent. You were pure love. I'm going to take care of you from now on. You were talented and creative. I'm going to express you. You're safe now. You can love and you can let love in. You won't be hurt. You can discern now. I'll take care of us. I'll pull us together. We were always apart, playing different roles, learning to cope. You're not crazy. You were afraid. He can't hurt you anymore. I've stopped taking the alcohol and drugs that were concealing your anger, your rage, your sadness, your depression, your guilt, and your anxiety. You can let go of those feelings now. I've stopped punishing us, like he did. I've surrendered to God. We are worthwhile. I am worthwhile. The world we made up is over now. We are waking up. It still hurts, but not as much. And it's finally real.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In this letter I want you to embrace that child and reintegrate him or her into your personality. Be a loving parent. Give the child the nurturing and support you never had. Make the child feel loved and worthwhile for the first time. Dan -- the engineer who was sexually abused by his father during his entire childhood and adolescence -- had long felt loathing for the little boy he once was, the little boy who was too weak to resist his father. This portion of his letter to that little boy shows how dramatically those feelings had changed after only a few group sessions:</div>

<div class="line_en">This fairy tale is the first assignment you'll write in the third person; instead of using the point of view of "I," you'll write about "he" or "she." This will help you see your inner world from a new, more objective perspective, putting some emotional distance between you and your childhood traumas. By referring to the little girl as "her" instead of "me," the sharp pain of your experiences will begin to fade. When you bring your feelings to life through symbols, you will be able to deal with them on a level you've never approached before, and you will come away with a new, clearer understanding of what happened to you.</div>

You may not really believe that when you begin this work, but by writing optimistically about your future, you will start to draw more positive pictures in your mind. This is especially important for people who cannot imagine a happy future for themselves. By imagining a better life, you can begin to develop concrete, attainable goals, and once you have goals, you have something to inspire you.</div>

<div class="line_en">LETTER TO YOUR CHILDREN</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Role playing cuts through the intellectualizing and denial that you may be using as a defense against your feelings. It offers you a chance to express the full range of your emotions toward family members before you are ready to face them. It provides a safe atmosphere for you to try out new behaviors. All of these factors are essential for successful treatment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In group, after all the letters are read, we set up brief improvised scenes to deal with issues brought up in the letters.

<div class="line_en">Three months into group, Connie was feeling strong enough to mail her letters to her father and mother. But she realized that once her letters arrived, she would need a lot of support. I asked her whether her husband, Wayne, could provide it, and she sheepishly admitted that she still hadn't told him about her father's sexual abuse.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Like most incest victims, Connie was convinced that he would lose his attraction to her, that it would make her disgusting and repellent to him. Even though she had many years of evidence that Wayne was a loving, supportive man, her anxiety still prevented her from revealing her painful secret. But now she needed him to know.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">To help ease Connie's fears, I asked her to use role playing in group to rehearse telling Wayne before she ventured to attempt the real thing. We played out a number of scenes with myself or another group member playing Wayne and reacting in a variety of ways, ranging from total acceptance to total rejection.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In one particularly dramatic scene, Connie herself played Wayne so that she could try to experience some of his feelings. I played Connie. After telling "Wayne" about what my father had done to me, I told him what I needed from him.</div>

If anything, knowing this makes you even more precious to me. I've always known that there was something painful inside you that made you so suspicious and angry all the time, and now that I know what it is, it all starts to make sense.

<div class="line_en">You can use role playing to embolden yourself to break the silence.

<div class="line_en">Even though you may feel considerable pain over the fact that you couldn't do this at the time, this rewriting of history is an exciting and empowering exercise. As Dan said:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">To give yourself a rebirth of power, close your eyes and visualize the first time you remember being molested, but this time, change what happened. See the room where it took place. See your aggressor. Put your hands out and push your aggressor away, saying, "No! You can't! I won't let you! Go away! I'll tell! I'll scream!" Visualize the aggressor obeying you. Watch him turn around and leave the room, becoming smaller and smaller as he walks out the door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">If you're like the great majority of incest victims, you don't know how to say "no." You may believe you are powerless, that you have to do whatever anyone asks. These beliefs have their genesis in your expereince of having been coerced, intimidated, and humiliated by a powerful parent.</div>

Once you've formed your group of abused children, tell your group leader about the "weird stuff" that's going on in your house. The other "children" can ask questions as well as comfort you. In the following excerpt from a recent group session, Connie had a major breakthrough.</div>

<div class="line_en">Between sobs, Connie told us that she hadn't cried for years and that she was frightened by how defenseless it made her feel.

<div class="line_en">If your parents are still together you can confront them at the same time or separately. However, I have found that in incest cases, it is usually less explosive to confront parents separately. Confronted together, parents of incest victims often close ranks to defend their marriage against what they perceive as an all-out attack. In that case, it will be two against one, and it becomes especially important for you to have a support person with you.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">While there is no way to predict how any aggressor will react, confronting him by himself does seem to take some of the heat out. Your aggressor may deny that the incest ever happened, may become enraged and leave the session, may attack your therapist for encouraging you to hurt the family, may try to minimize his crimes, or may even acknowledge what he did. You must be prepared for anything. If he does acknowledge his crimes, beware of excuses. Aggressors often try to manipulate their victims into feeling sorry for them.</div>

<div class="line_en">A word of warning: apologies can be very seductive and can create false hope that things will change significantly in your relationship. If apologies are not followed by behavioral changes in the aggressor, however, nothing will change. He must be willing to do something about the problem. Otherwise, apologies are empty words that will only set you up for further hurt and disappointment.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tracy decided to confront her father and mother separately. Tracy told her father that she was in therapy but didn't specify what kind. She said it would be very helpful if he would come in for a joint session with her. He agreed but canceled several appointments before he finally showed up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Obviously, few victims get a positive response to all or even most of these requests, but it is essential for your growth that you make them. You need to define the ground rules for any future relationship. You must show clearly that you will no longer live with lies, half-truths, secrecy, and denial. Most important, you must make it clear that you will no longer accept the responsibility for the violence committed against you -- that you are no longer willing to be a victim.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tracy's father, Harold, was a slightly built, balding man in his late fifties. He was impeccably groomed and looked every inch the executive that he now was. When I asked him if he knew why Tracy wanted him to come in to see me, he said he had "a pretty good idea." I began by asking Tracy to tell her father what kind of therapy she was in:</div>

</div>
<div class="line_en">Harold flushed visibly and averted his eyes. He started to say something, but Tracy stopped him and got him to agree to hear her out. She continued to tell him what he had done to her and how sick, frightened, confused, and dirty it had made her feel. Then she told him how the incest had affected her life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I never felt it was okay for me to like another man. I always felt I was betraying you or cheating on you. I felt like a possession, like I had no life outside you. I believed you when you said I was a slut -- after all, I had this dirty secret inside of me. I thought it was my fault. I've been depressed most of my life but I learned to act like everything's okay. Well, everything's not okay, Dad, and it's time for all of us to stop acting. My marriage almost fell apart because I hated sex, I hated my body, I hated me! That's all changing now, thank God. But you've been getting off scot-free while I've been carrying the whole load. You betrayed me, you used me, you did the worst thing that a father can do to his little girl.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I'm in a group for victims of incest, Dad. People who have fathers and sometimes mothers who did to them what you did to me.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tracy's father was stunned. He accused her of blackmailing him. He made no attempt to deny the incest, but tried to minimize it by reminding Tracy that he had never "hurt her physically." He did apologize, but his primary concern was about the effects on his marriage and his professional status if all this became "public knowledge." He denied that he needed any therapy because he had led a "useful and productive life."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The following week Tracy pressured her father into "confessing" to her mother. Tracy then came to group and reported on the aftermath:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My mother was pretty devastated but in the next breath she asked me to forgive him and not to tell anyone else in the family. When I told her I wouldn't agree to do that she asked me why I needed to hurt them so much. Do you love it -- all of a sudden I'm the bad guy in all of this.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then Tracy told her father what she wanted from him -- an apology and a full acknowledgment of his responsibility. She also gave him a chance to tell her mother before she did.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tracy needed very little help from me in her confrontation with her father. On the other hand, Liz -- whose stepfather, the powerful local minister, not only abused her but almost strangled her when she found the courage to tell him to stop -- needed a great deal, especially since her mother and stepfather insisted on coming in together. When Liz told her parents that she wanted them to come to a therapy session, they told her they would "do anything to help her with her mental problems."</div>

</div>
<div class="line_en">You've both betrayed her enough -- I'm not going to permit it anymore. I'm sorry that neither of you has the courage to admit the truth. Burt, you know everything Liz is saying is true. No one makes up these humiliating and painful things. And no one makes up years of depression and shame. The statute of limitations has run out on your crime, but I want you to know that because you're in a position of trust and authority with other children, Liz and I have reported you to Child Protective Services. If you ever hurt another child, that report will weigh heavily against you. I don't see how you can minister to other people when your whole life is built on a lie. You're a fraud and a child molester, Reverend! You know it and God knows it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Liz did and said everything she had practiced, but every time she attempted to talk about the molestations she was met with a stone wall of angry denial and accusation. According to her parents, she was insane, she was making it all up, and she was a wicked, vengeful girl, trying to get back at Burt for having been a "stern disciplinarian." Liz was holding her own but getting nowhere. She looked at me helplessly. I stepped in:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Liz's stepfather, Burt, was a courtly, ruddy-faced man now in his early sixties. It was significant that he wore his black clerical suit and white collar to the session. Liz's mother, Rhoda, was a tall, thin, stern-faced woman with black hair heavily streaked with gray. Both were full of righteous indignation from the moment they walked in the door.</div>

<div class="line_en">Burt and Rhoda's defenses were impenetrable, and I saw no reason to prolong Liz's pain. She had all the information she needed, so I asked Burt and Rhoda to leave.</div>

<div class="line_en">Burt's face turned to stone. He said nothing, but his rage was obvious. I turned to Liz's mother in one last attempt to get her to face the truth, but all my words fell on deaf ears.</div>

<div class="line_en">I've got to cut them out of my life. They're just too crazy. The only way I could have a relationship with them is for me to be crazy too. Now that I'm so much stronger, it's like they're from another planet. God, Susan, that woman was supposed to be my mother!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She started to cry. I held her for several minutes as she sobbed. Finally, she said:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I guess what hurts the most is realizing that they simply don't care about me and never have. I mean, by any normal definition of love, they don't love me.</div>

<div class="line_en">Liz knew that she had to make a choice between her parents and her emotional well-being. It was not possible for her to have both. Her decision didn't take long:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">With that last statement Liz showed a willingness to face the terrible truth that many adults who were abused as children have to face -- in the final analysis, her parents were simply incapable of love. It was their failure and their character flaws that created this painful reality, not hers.</div>

<div class="line_en">Connie's parents lived in another state, so she decided to confront with separate letters to her father and mother. During the exercise in which she played herself as a child, Connie had remembered that when her father molested her the first time, she had told her mother. It was especially important to Connie to find out why her mother had failed to take steps to protect her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Connie was climbing the walls with anxiety after she mailed her letters. After three weeks she bemoaned the fact that she hadn't gotten an answer from her father.</div>

<div class="line_en">No matter what I say, it will always be inadequate for all the harm that has been done to you. At the time I thought I was protecting you the best I knew how. I did talk to him about it, but he apologized and swore he wouldn't do it again. He seemed so sincere. He begged for another chance and told me he loved me. No one will ever know my fear, my uncertainty. I didn't know what to do, I thought the problem was over. Now I realize to my own disgust how he tricked me so easily. I wanted a happy family so badly that I resorted to the big cover-up. I was so intent on keeping peace in our lives. My mind is going around in circles and I can't say any more about this right now. Maybe, as always, I've been no help to you, Connie, but please accept that I do love you and want the very best for you.</div>

At my suggestion, Connie set up a conference call between her mother, herself, and me. During the call, Connie's mother, Margaret, again expressed her sorrow over what had happened and again acknowledged her weakness and complicity. I too began to have hopes that these two women could build something of value between them… until Connie asked for the one thing she really wanted.</div>

But I do want him to hear this from you.</div>

<div class="line_en">CONNIE: So you're going to protect him over me, just like you always have. When I got your letter, I thought maybe, finally, I was going to have a mother.

<div class="line_en">This will be a sad but exciting time for you, for the other members of your group, and for your therapist. You will have to say goodbye to the only good family you have ever known, though many of my group members maintain close friendships long after they have left group. These friendships from group, based on having shared powerful emotional experiences, tend to be extremely strong and provide ongoing affection and support to help alleviate the sense of loss when you leave therapy.</div>

<div class="line_en">There comes a time in the treatment process when you will have written and rewritten all the letters, gone through the role playing, the exercises, and the confrontations, and made the decisions about your future relationship with your parents. You will see ever-increasing evidence of your strength and well-being. The changes in your beliefs, your feelings, and your behavior will be integrated into your personality. In short, you will be ready for "graduation."</div>

If your parents are unusually supportive, as Dan's mother was, that time may be shorter. If you elect to cut off your relationship, as Connie did with her father, you may need to stay in group somewhat longer to avoid piling one loss (of your group) on top of another (of your parent). I never cease to be amazed at the dramatic changes that occur in this relatively short period of time, especially when you consider how extensive the original damage was.</div>

No matter how low you feel, there is a better life for you, a life of self-respect and freedom from guilt, fear, and shame. All the people you've met in this chapter have moved from despair to health. You can too.</div>
