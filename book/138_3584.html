<div class="line_en">"Years ago, when I was young, I made Monsieur Beaurain's acquaintance one Sunday in this neighborhood. He was employed in a draper's shop, and I was a saleswoman in a ready-made clothing establishment. I remember it as if it were yesterday. I used to come and spend Sundays here occasionally with a friend of mine, Rose Leveque, with whom I lived in the Rue Pigalle, and Rose had a sweetheart, while I had none. He used to bring us here, and one Saturday he told me laughing that he should bring a friend with him the next day. I quite understood what he meant, but I replied that it would be no good; for I was virtuous, monsieur.</div>

<div class="line_en">"The next day we met Monsieur Beaurain at the railway station, and in those days he was good-looking, but I had made up my mind not to encourage him, and I did not. Well, we arrived at Bezons. It was a lovely day, the sort of day that touches your heart. When it is fine even now, just as it used to be formerly, I grow quite foolish, and when I am in the country I utterly lose my head. The green grass, the swallows flying so swiftly, the smell of the grass, the scarlet poppies, the daisies, all that makes me crazy. It is like champagne when one is not accustomed to it!</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, it was lovely weather, warm and bright, and it seemed to penetrate your body through your eyes when you looked and through your mouth when you breathed. Rose and Simon hugged and kissed each other every minute, and that gave me a queer feeling! Monsieur Beaurain and I walked behind them, without speaking much, for when people do not know each other, they do not find anything to talk about. He looked timid, and I liked to see his embarrassment. At last we got to the little wood; it was as cool as in a bath there, and we four sat down. Rose and her lover teased me because I looked rather stern, but you will understand that I could not be otherwise. And then they began to kiss and hug again, without putting any more restraint upon themselves than if we had not been there; and then they whispered together, and got up and went off among the trees, without saying a word. You may fancy what I looked like, alone with this young fellow whom I saw for the first time. I felt so confused at seeing them go that it gave me courage, and I began to talk. I asked him what his business was, and he said he was a linen draper's assistant, as I told you just now. We talked for a few minutes, and that made him bold, and he wanted to take liberties with me, but I told him sharply to keep his place. Is not that true, Monsieur Beaurain?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"And then, monsieur, business became better, and we were tranquil as to the future! Then, you see, I do not exactly know what went on in my mind, no, I really do not know, but I began to dream like a little boarding-school girl. The sight of the little carts full of flowers which are drawn about the streets made me cry; the smell of violets sought me out in my easy-chair, behind my cash box, and made my heart beat! Then I would get up and go out on the doorstep to look at the blue sky between the roofs. When one looks up at the sky from the street, it looks like a river which is descending on Paris, winding as it flows, and the swallows pass to and fro in it like fish. These ideas are very stupid at my age! But how can one help it, monsieur, when one has worked all one's life? A moment comes in which one perceives that one could have done something else, and that one regrets, oh! yes, one feels intense regret! Just think, for twenty years I might have gone and had kisses in the woods, like other women. I used to think how delightful it would be to lie under the trees and be in love with some one! And I thought of it every day and every night! I dreamed of the moonlight on the water, until I felt inclined to drown myself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最近营业情况大为好转，我们不再为糊口担忧。然而在身上却发生了不可名状的变化，莫名其妙的变化。我又开始象个妙龄女郎那样沉浸于幻想之中，望着满载鲜花穿越街道而去的车辆，我会流泪。当我靠在账台背后的圈手椅上的时候，紫罗兰的芬芳向我袭来，我心头怦怦乱跳，我会神差鬼使地站起身来，站到店门前，从一排排屋脊之间眺望蓝天。从街心仰望天空时，天空成了一条河流——一条长河，它蜿蜒地流过巴黎。燕子宛如河里的鱼那样游来游去。我明知我这年龄还有这等遐想是多么可笑！但是，怎么也抑制不住呀！一个人长年不停地工作，偶而也会想些别的什么；于是就发生了令人后悔的事情。是的，实在令人后悔。您想想，乡长先生，我本该与其他女人一样，有这份权利在树林里让恋人亲吻30年。我忍不住向往躺在绿树花丛之中和恋人作爱，那该有多么美好。我白天黑夜都想。我梦想月光映在水面上，甚至想到情愿跳下去淹死自己。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It was a hard struggle for some years, monsieur. Business did not prosper, and we could not afford many country excursions, and, besides, we had got out of the way of them. One has other things in one's head, and thinks more of the cash box than of pretty speeches, when one is in business. We were growing old by degrees without perceiving it, like quiet people who do not think much about love. One does not regret anything as long as one does not notice what one has lost.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们的日子很艰苦，因为生意不景气，几乎无力支付郊游的费用，而且也渐渐地丧失了这种兴趣，头脑里塞满了各式各样的事情。生意人想到的首先是钱柜，而不是鲜花。我们就这样糊里糊涂、不知不觉地都老了，成了循规蹈矩的人，几乎不懂爱情为何物了。只要不感到缺什么，也就不需要什么了。">查看中文翻译</div>

I was very fond of him also, very fond of him! He was a good-looking fellow, formerly, and in short he married me the next September, and we started in business in the Rue des Martyrs.</div>
