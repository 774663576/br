<div class="line_en">Last night, I took a break from writing and watched a TV program on the history of a young man named Alexander Graham Bell. Bell had just patented his telephone, and was having growing pains because the demand for his new invention was so strong. Needing a bigger company, he then went to the giant at that time, Western Union, and asked them if they would buy his patent and his tiny company. He wanted $100,000 for the whole package. The president of Western Union scoffed at him and turned him down, saying the price was ridiculous. The rest is history. A multi-billion-dollar industry emerged, and AT&amp;T was born.</div>

<div class="line_en">The evening news came on right after the story of Alexander Graham Bell ended. On the news was a story of another downsizing at a local company. The workers were angry and complained that the company ownership was unfair. A terminated manager of about 45 years of age had his wife and two babies at the plant and was begging the guards to let him talk to the owners to ask if they would reconsider his termination. He had just bought a house and was afraid of losing it. The camera focused in on his pleading for all the world to see. Needless to say, it held my attention.</div>

<div class="line_en">I have been teaching professionally since 1984. It has been a great experience and rewarding. It is also a disturbing profession, for I have taught thousands of individuals and I see one thing in common in all of us, myself included. We all have tremendous potential, and we all are blessed with gifts. Yet, the one thing that holds all of us back is some degree of self-doubt. It is not so much the lack of technical information that holds us back, but more the lack of self-confidence. Some are more affected than others.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我从1984年开始教育生涯，这是一种非常有益的经历，甚至是一种奖励。但这也是一个令人不安的职业，因为我曾经教过数千人，从中发现了所有人——包括我自己的一个共同点：我们都拥有巨大的潜能——这一上天赏赐的礼物。然而，问题是我们都或多或少地存在着某种自我怀疑，从而阻碍了自己的前进。阻碍我们前进的障碍很少是由于缺乏技术性信息，更多的是由于缺乏自信。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Once we leave school, most of us know that it is not as much a matter of college degrees or good grades that count. In the real world outside of academics, something more than just grades is required. I have heard it called "guts", "chutzpah", "balls", "audacity", "bravado", "cunning", "daring", "tenacity" and "brilliance." This factor, whatever it is labeled, ultimately decides one's future much more than school grades.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一旦我们离开学校，我们之中大部分人就会意识到，仅仅有大学文凭或好分数是远远不够的。在校园之外的现实世界里，有许多比好分数更为重要的东西，我常常听到人们将这些东西称之为“魄力”、“勇气”、“毅力”、“大胆”、“气势”、“精明”、“勇敢”。“坚强”、“才华横溢”等等。不管怎么称呼，这都是比学校分数更能从根本上决定人们未来的因素。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Inside each of us is one of these brave, brilliant and daring characters. There is also the flip side of that character: people who could get down on their knees and beg if necessary.

<div class="line_en">Yet, as a teacher, I recognized that it was excessive fear and self-doubt that were the greatest detractors of personal genius.

<div class="line_en">So why bother developing your financial IQ? No one can answer that but you. Yet, I can tell you why I myself do it. I do it because it is the most exciting time to be alive. I'd rather be welcoming change than dreading change. I'd rather be excited about making millions than worrying about not getting a raise. This period we are in now is a most exciting time, unprecedented in our world's history.

<div class="line_en">Land was wealth 300 years ago. So the person who owned the land owned the wealth. Then, it was factories and production, and America rose to dominance. The industrialist owned the wealth. Today, it is information. And the person who has the most timely information owns the wealth. The problem is, information flies all around the world at the speed of light. The new wealth cannot be contained by boundaries and borders as land and factories were.

I know people who are losing their jobs or their houses, and they blame technology or the economy or their boss. Sadly they fail to realize that they might be the problem. Old ideas are their biggest liability. It is a liability simply because they fail to realize that while that idea or way of doing something was an asset yesterday, yesterday is gone.</div>

The rest of her table waited while her friend continued explaining the relationship between the income statement, balance sheet and monthly cash flow.

<div class="line_en">In 1984, I began teaching via games and simulations. I always encouraged adult students to look at games as reflecting back to what they know, and what they needed to learn.
