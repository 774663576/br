<div class="line_en">As the keys rattled and the door to his cell pushed inward, creaking, Tyrion pressed back against the dampness of the wall, wishing for a weapon. I can still bite and kick. I'll die with the taste of blood in my mouth, that's something. He wished he'd been able to think of some rousing last words. "Bugger you all" was not like to earn him much of a place in the histories.</div>

<div class="line_en">Past time, he thought. Come on, come on, make an end to it. He pushed himself to his feet. His legs were asleep from being folded under him. He bent down and rubbed the knives from them. I will not go stumbling and waddling to the headsman's block.</div>

<div class="line_en">He wondered whether they would kill him down here in the dark or drag him through the city so Ser Ilyn Payne could lop his head off. After his mummer's farce of a trial, his sweet sister and loving father might prefer to dispose of him quietly, rather than risk a public execution. I could tell the mob a few choice things, if they let me speak. But would they be that foolish?</div>

<div class="line_en">"Maegor the Cruel decreed four levels of dungeons for his castle," Varys replied. "On the upper level, there are large cells where common criminals may be confined together. They have narrow windows set high in the walls. The second level has the smaller cells where highborn captives are held. They have no windows, but torches in the halls cast light through the bars. On the third level the cells are smaller and the doors are wood. The black cells, men call them. That was where you were kept, and Eddard Stark before you. But there is a level lower still. Once a man is taken down to the fourth level, he never sees the sun again, nor hears a human voice, nor breathes a breath free of agonizing pain. Maegor had the cells on the fourth level built for torment." They had reached the bottom of the steps. An unlighted door opened before them. "This is the fourth level. Give me your hand, my lord.

<div class="line_en">A light appeared ahead of them, too dim to be daylight, and grew as they hurried toward it. After a while he could see it was an arched doorway, closed off by another iron gate. Varys produced a key. They stepped through into a small round chamber. Five other doors opened off the room, each barred in iron. There was an opening in the ceiling as well, and a series of rungs set in the wall below, leading upward. An ornate brazier stood to one side, fashioned in the shape of a dragon's head. The coals in the beast's yawning mouth had burnt down to embers, but they still glowed with a sullen orange light. Dim as it was, the light was welcome after the blackness of the tunnel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="前方出现一道光芒，过于昏暗，不像太阳，但随着他们快步接近，却逐渐变得亮起来。过了一会，他看清那原是拱梁下锁紧的铁门，瓦里斯用钥匙打开。他们来到一个圆形小房间，房间内除了来路，还有别的五道门，每道皆被铁门封锁。屋顶是个天井，墙壁间从上到下有串铁环，用来攀爬。角落里有个华丽的火盆，塑造成龙头形状，张开的口中炭火已烧成灰烬，却仍旧放出一点晕黄的光。虽然微弱，但与隧道的黑暗相比，已是难能可贵。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jaime would not be afraid, he thought, before he remembered what Jaime had done to him. He took the eunuch by the hand and let himself be led through the black, following the soft scrape of leather on stone. Varys walked quickly, from time to time whispering, "Careful, there are three steps ahead," or, "The tunnel slopes downward here, my lord." I arrived here a King's Hand, riding through the gates at the head of my own sworn men, Tyrion reflected, and I leave like a rat scuttling through the dark, holding hands with a spider.</div>

<div class="line_en">Rung by rung, he ascended into darkness. At first he could see the dim outline of each rung as he grasped it, and the rough grey texture of the stone behind, but as he climbed the black grew thicker. Thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen. By thirty, his arms trembled with the strain of pulling. He paused a moment to catch his breath and glanced down. A circle of faint light shone far below, half obscured by his own feet. Tyrion resumed his ascent. Thirty-nine forty forty-one. By fifty, his legs burned. The ladder was endless, numbing. Sixty-eight sixty-nine seventy. By eighty, his back was a dull agony.

<div class="line_en">At two hundred and thirty, the shaft was black as pitch, but he could feel the warm air flowing from the tunnel to his left, like the breath of some great beast. He poked about awkwardly with a foot and edged off the ladder. The tunnel was even more cramped than the shaft. Any man of normal size would have had to crawl on hands and knees, but Tyrion was short enough to walk upright. At last, a place made for dwarfs. His boots scuffed softly against the stone. He walked slowly, counting steps, feeling for gaps in the walls. Soon he began to hear voices, muffled and indistinct at first, then clearer. He listened more closely. Two of his father's guardsmen were joking about the Imp's whore, saying how sweet it would be to fuck her, and how bad she must want a real cock in place of the dwarf's stunted little thing. "Most like it's got a crook in it," said Lum. That led him into a discussion of how Tyrion would die on the morrow. "He'll weep like a woman and beg for mercy, you'll see," Lum insisted. Lester figured he'd face the axe brave as a lion, being a Lannister, and he was willing to bet his new boots on it. "Ah, shit in your boots," said Lum, "you know they'd never fit these feet Wmine. Tell you what, if I win you can scour my bloody mail for a fortnight."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="走到两百三十环时，周围黑得像掉进了沥青桶。他感觉到左边有暖风吹出，犹如巨兽的呼吸，便小心翼翼地伸腿试探，离开了铁环梯子。隧道极其促狭，若是正常体形的人来走，非得跪下，手脚并用不可，对提利昂倒刚好合适。古怪，这地方竟像是为侏儒设计的。鞋轻轻踩在石地板上，他走得很慢，一边小心计算步数，一边摸索墙上的机关。不久，他听见人声，起初朦胧细微，随后逐渐清晰，越来越真切。原来是父亲手下两名卫兵在谈论“小恶魔的妓女”，一边赞叹她身体甜美，一边可惜她生不逢时，侏儒那玩意儿一定又短又小，她大概连真正的男根是什么样都不清楚。“多半插不进去。”鲁姆认定，随后他们开始讨论提利昂明天的死法。“他会哭得像个姑娘，哀求饶恕，你瞧着吧。”鲁姆坚持。利斯特则说小恶魔会像狮子一样勇敢赴死，做个堂堂正正的兰尼斯特，为此他愿赌上自己的新鞋子。“见鬼，鞋子有个屁用，”鲁姆抱怨，“你明知它不合我的脚。算了，如果我赢，你帮我擦两个星期的盔甲！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tyrion's finger clenched. The crossbow whanged just as Lord Tywin started to rise. The bolt slammed into him above the groin and he sat back down with a grunt. The quarrel had sunk deep, right to the fletching. Blood seeped out around the shaft, dripping down into his pubic hair and over his bare thighs. "You shot me," he said incredulously, his eyes glassy with shock.</div>

<div class="line_en">For once, his father did what Tyrion asked him. The proof was the sudden stench, as his bowels loosened in the moment of death. Well, he was in the right place for it, Tyrion thought. But the stink that filled the privy gave ample evidence that the oft-repeated jape about his father was just another lie.</div>
