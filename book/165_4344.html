<div class="line_en">Cheng Xin came to the headquarters of the Halo Group. This was her first time here. She had never participated in its operation because, subconsciously, she never thought of the enormous wealth as truly hers, or Yun Tianming's. They possessed that star, but the wealth generated by the star belonged to society.</div>

<div class="line_en">After the meeting, when only Cheng Xin and AA remained in the large, empty room, they began to talk about the future of the company. The message from Yun Tianming and the deciphering progress remained secrets from the public. To protect Tianming, Fleet International and the UN planned to release the results gradually to the public and to make them appear as the fruits of research on Earth. Some deliberate false research results would also be mixed in to further conceal the real origin of the information.</div>

<div class="line_en">Cheng Xin had gotten used to the transparent floor and no longer felt so acrophobic. A few large information windows drifted in the conference room, displaying live video feeds from a few of the Halo Group's construction projects in Earth orbit, one of which was the giant cross in geosynchronous orbit. After Tianming's reappearance, the public's hopes for a miracle gradually faded, and with the initiation of the Bunker Project, the religious fervor dimmed. The church stopped investing in the giant cross, and it was abandoned. Now it was in the process of being dismantled so that only a giant "1" remained -- a rather meaningful sight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="程心已经适应了脚下透明的地板，不再有恐高的感觉。会议室里飘浮着几个宽大的信息窗口，显示着星环公司在地球轨道上几处在建项目的实时图像，其中之一就是那个位于同步轨道上的巨型十字架。云天明出现后。公众对奇迹的幻想渐渐消失，随着掩体工程的启动，世界上的宗教氛围很快淡下去，教会的投资中止了，那个十字架成了烂尾工程，现在正在拆除，只剩下一个“一”字，看上去倒是更加意味深长。">查看中文翻译</div>

A "window avalanche" like this usually indicated the sudden occurrence of some important event, but the flood of information often caused people to be overwhelmed, unable to find out what actually happened. Such was the case with AA and Cheng Xin. They saw that most of the windows were filled with complex text and animated figures, and only those windows that showed pure images could be taken in at a glance. In one of the windows, Cheng Xin saw a few faces looking upwards, then the lens zoomed in until a frightened pair of eyes filled the frame, accompanied by a cacophony of screams…</div>

<div class="line_en">Halo was a corporate spaceship that belonged to the Halo Group. Right now, it was parked at the company's geosynchronous base. If the alarm was real, their only hope now was to ride the ship to Jupiter and hide out behind the gas giant before the photoid struck. As Jupiter was in opposition, and therefore as close to the Earth as it could be, it would take twenty-five to thirty days for the ship to fly from the Earth to Jupiter, which was just under the upper end of the range of estimates for when the photoid would strike. But this estimate seemed highly unreliable: The advance warning system was still being constructed, and couldn't have given such an early alert.</div>

<div class="line_en">A loud rumbling came from the launch area, strangely reminding Cheng Xin of the noise made by the Moskstraumen. The ground quaked and her legs felt numb. A great bright glow appeared in the launch area, and a shuttle rose into the air on a ball of flame, adding yet another column of smoke to the sky. A great billowing cloud of white fog flowed toward them, bringing with it a strange burning smell. The fog wasn't generated by the engine of the shuttle, but by the boiled water from the coolant pool below the launch pad. As the launch area and the ships disappeared in the sweltering, muggy steam, people became even more agitated and anxious.</div>

It was hard to imagine that such tiny crafts could escape the Earth's gravity well. There were also larger vessels, some as big as ancient airliners. The Halo Group's shuttle was medium-small in size, about ten meters tall, covered with a reflective metallic surface reminiscent of the droplets. The shuttle was parked on a wheeled launch frame so that it could be dragged to the launch point at a moment's notice. They would ride this shuttle to reach Halo in orbit.</div>

<div class="line_en">The teacher saw Cheng Xin walking over, and came up and grabbed her. "This shuttle is yours, isn't it? Please, please save the children." Her bangs stuck to her forehead, and tears and condensed fog wetted her face. She stared at Cheng Xin intently, as if hoping to seize her with her gaze. The children came over as well, and looked expectantly at Cheng Xin. "They're here for space camp, and they were scheduled to go up in orbit. But after the alert was issued, they refused to take us and sent others up in our place."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="女教师看到程心走过去，没等她发问，就扑过来抓住她，“这架穿梭机是你们的吧？求求你救救孩子们吧！”她湿漉漉的刘海儿紧贴在前额上，眼泪和雾水一起在脸上流淌，她盯着程心，像要用眼神把她死死抓住似的。孩子们也围了过来，期盼的目光都汇聚到程心身上，“我们是太空夏令营的，本来就是要上同步轨道的，可是警报来了以后，他们不让我们登机了，让别人上去了！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">AA and Cheng Xin climbed up a slender set of stairs to board the shuttle. As the fog dissipated, Cheng Xin saw a crowd of children gathered not too far away. They appeared to be elementary school students under the age of ten, dressed in their school uniforms. A young teacher stood with them. Her long hair was buffeted by gusts of wind and she looked around helplessly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在AA和程心即将沿着一架细长的舷梯登上穿梭机之际，程心在渐渐消散的气雾中看到了一群孩子。他们就聚在不远处，看上去都是十岁以下的小学生，全穿着整洁漂亮的校服，有一位年轻女教师领着他们，她的长发被气浪吹起，正站在那里四下张望，一副茫然无助的样子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，我来选。”AA说，然后转向孩子们，脸上露出笑容，“同学们听着。我出三道题，先答对我们就带谁走。”她不理会程心和女教师吃惊的目光。竖起一根手指。“第一题：有一盏灯，关着，一分钟时闪亮了一下，再过半分钟又闪亮一下，再过十五秒再闪亮一下，以后就这样每过前面间隔时间的一半就闪亮一下，请问到两分钟时灯闪亮了多少次？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Cheng Xin followed them to the stairs for boarding the shuttle. She looked back. The remaining children and their teacher looked at her as if at a sun that would never rise again. Tears blurred the scene in front of her, and as she climbed up, she could still feel the gazes of despair behind her, like ten thousand arrows piercing her heart. She had felt like this before, during the last moments of her brief career as the Swordholder, and also in Australia when Sophon had announced the plan for exterminating the human race. It was a pain worse than death.</div>

Since the cabin was vertical, like a well, everyone had to climb a ladder to get to the seats. Cheng Xin experienced the same feeling she had when inside the spherical spacecraft she took to meet Tianming -- the shuttle seemed to be a shell only, and she couldn't see where there was space for the engine and the control systems.

<div class="line_en">Society had already descended into pandemonium. Driven by the instinct for survival, the more than ten million inhabitants of the city swarmed toward the spaceport. The shuttles, like passenger aircraft during ancient times, could only carry away a small number of people in a short period of time. Possessing a private space vessel was like owning a private airplane, an unattainable dream for most of the population.

When launched from a flat surface, the plasma would melt the crust instantaneously and spill out in every direction. No one could survive within a thirty-meter radius.

All that was known was that a photoid moved at close to the speed of light, but there was no data concerning its volume, rest mass, or relativistic mass as it approached the speed of light. A photoid was certainly the most primitive weapon capable of attacking a star, since it relied only on the enormous kinetic energy generated by its high relativistic mass to damage the target.

<div class="line_en">At first blush, it seemed impossible to give advance warning for photoids, because they moved at close to the speed of light. This meant that they moved almost as fast as the radiation they generated, and reached their target almost simultaneously. In other words, the observer was outside the event's light cone. But reality was a bit more complicated. Any object with rest mass could not achieve lightspeed. Although a photoid's speed approached lightspeed, it was still slightly slower than true lightspeed. This difference meant that the radiation from the photoid moved just a bit faster than the photoid itself. If the photoid had to travel a long distance, this difference was magnified. Also, a photoid's trajectory to the target wasn't an absolute straight line. Since it wasn't massless, it couldn't avoid the gravitational attractions of nearby celestial bodies, and its path typically ended up being slightly curved. The curvature was much greater than the curvature of light through the same gravitational field. For the photoid to strike the target, its trajectory had to take this effect into account. This meant that the path traveled by the photoid was longer than the path taken by its radiation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="初看光粒攻击是无法预警的，因为它的运行速度几乎是光速，与它自己产生的辐射几乎并行前进，同时到达目标——换句话说，观测者在事件光锥之外——但真实的情况却更复杂一些。由于有静止质量的物体不可能完全达到光速，光粒的速度虽极为接近光速。但与精确的光速还是有一个微小的差值，这个差值使得光粒发出的辐射比光粒本身要稍快一些，如果光粒的飞行距离足够长，这个差值将越来越大。另外，光粒攻击目标的弹道并非绝对直线，由于其巨大的质量，不可避免地受附近天体引力的影响，弹道会发生轻微的弯曲，而这种弯曲比纯光线在相同引力场中弯曲的曲率要大得多，在接近目标时需要进行修正，这就使得光粒所走的路程比它发出的辐射要长一些。">查看中文翻译</div>

Scientists were able to make an important discovery: Due to a photoid's ultrahigh velocity, powerful radiation ranging from visible light to gamma rays was emitted as it collided with the few atoms scattered in space and interstellar dust. The radiation had distinctive characteristics. Since the photoids were extremely small, direct observation of them was impossible. But the characteristic radiation could be detected.</div>

More than seventy years ago, it was this observation station that had first discovered the strong-interaction space probes -- the droplets. The station was still located on the outer edge of the asteroid belt, but all its equipment had been updated. Take the visible light telescope, for instance: The lenses were even bigger, and the first lens's diameter had increased from twelve hundred meters to two thousand meters, big enough for a small town to fit on it. These gigantic lenses were made from materials taken directly from the asteroid belt. The first one was a medium-sized lens five hundred meters in diameter. After that was finished, it was used to focus sunlight on asteroids so that the melted rock could be made into pure glass and then formed into additional lenses. In total, six lenses floated in a ten-kilometer-long column in space, far apart from each other. The observation station itself was located at the end of the column of lenses, and could only hold a crew of two.</div>

No matter how powerful the telescopes were, the stars always showed up as tiny point sources, only incrementally brighter than images taken by lesser telescopes. But now, in the view of this ultrapowerful telescope, a star showed up as a disk for the first time.

<div class="line_en">In the unprocessed view of the telescope, the Trisolaran system looked very ordinary, just a small patch of white against the background of space, like a feather. But after the image had been processed and magnified, it appeared as a magnificent nebula that took up the entire screen. It had been seven years since the explosion of the star, so what they were seeing now was the scene three years after the explosion. Under the influence of gravity and the exploded star's angular momentum, the nebula had turned from sharp radiating rays into a soft blur of clouds, which was then flattened by the centrifugal force of the spin into a spiral. Above the nebula, the two remaining stars could be seen. One of them showed up as a disk, while the other one, more distant, remained a point of light distinguished only by its motion against the background stars.</div>

<div class="line_en">The two stars that survived the catastrophe achieved the dream of generations on Trisolaris and formed a stable double-star system, but no life would enjoy their light, as the entire system was now uninhabitable. It was now apparent that the dark forest strike had destroyed only one star out of the three, not only because of economics, but also to achieve a more sinister goal: As long as the system still retained one or two stars, the material in the nebula would be constantly absorbed by the stars, generating powerful radiation in the process. The Trisolaran system was now a radiation furnace, a domain of death for life and civilization. It was the powerful radiation that caused the nebula itself to glow and appear so clear and bright on the telescope.</div>

But it was certain that they wanted to avoid purposefully leaving such trails. Eleven years ago, the Second Trisolaran Fleet had cruised for a full year using conventional means, and only when they were six thousand AU from their home world did they engage the curvature engines to enter lightspeed.

<div class="line_en">The discovery of the curvature propulsion trail finally eliminated lightspeed space flight, already facing mounting skepticism, from consideration as a viable plan. Fleet International and the UN quickly enacted legislation prohibiting any further research and development of curvature propulsion, and the nation states followed suit.

<div class="line_en">Superficially, research and development of lightspeed spaceflight died for obvious reasons: to avoid advance exposure of the existence of Earth civilization by the trails generated from curvature propulsion, and to prevent increasing the Solar System's danger value in the eyes of observers elsewhere in the cosmos, either of which might have led to an earlier dark forest strike. But there were deeper reasons, too.</div>

<div class="line_en">From the Common Era to the end of the Crisis Era, humanity looked at the stars with hope. But the first few steps they took toward the stars resulted in failure and pain. The tragic Doomsday Battle revealed the extent of humanity's fragility in the cosmos, and the internecine warfare of the Battle of Darkness had injured the human spirit in equal measure. Later events, such as the judgment of Bronze Age and the hijacking of Gravity by Blue Space, resulting in the universal broadcast, all deepened these wounds and elevated the pain to the level of philosophy.</div>

<div class="line_en">They cared far more about the Bunker Project, which seemed the most practical path to survival. To be sure, they also cared for the Black Domain Plan, because three centuries of horror had infused them with a strong desire for a serene life, and the Black Domain Plan promised just such a life. Although people were disappointed at the prospect of being sealed off from the rest of the universe, the Solar System itself was large enough that the disappointment was tolerable. The reason they were more interested in the Bunker Project than the Black Domain Plan was because even laypeople could see the extreme technical challenges of slowing down lightspeed, and generally agreed that it was unlikely for mere Man to complete God's Engineering Project.</div>

<div class="line_en">The faction in support of researching lightspeed spaceflight believed that the ultimate security of the human race required expansion into the Milky Way and settlement among the stars. In this unfeeling cosmos, only outward-facing civilizations had a chance of survival, and isolationism ultimately led to annihilation. Those who held such views generally did not oppose the Bunker Project, but passionately despised the Black Domain Plan, viewing it as an attempt to dig humankind's own grave. Even though they conceded that a black domain would guarantee the long-term survival of the human race, they saw such life as death for the civilization.</div>

<div class="line_en">The faction opposed to researching lightspeed vessels felt this way for political reasons. They believed that human civilization had suffered many trials before reaching a nearly ideal democratic society, but once humanity headed for space, it would inevitably regress socially. Space was like a distorting mirror that magnified the dark side of humanity to the maximum. A line from one of the Bronze Age defendants, Sebastian Schneider, became their slogan: When humans are lost in space, it takes only five minutes to reach totalitarianism.</div>
