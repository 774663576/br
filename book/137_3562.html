<div class="line_en">Soon the ever-increasing uproar around the edifice, and the uneasy bleating of her goat which had been awakened, had roused her from her slumbers. She had sat up, she had listened, she had looked; then, terrified by the light and noise, she had rushed from her cell to see. The aspect of the Place, the vision which was moving in it, the disorder of that nocturnal assault, that hideous crowd, leaping like a cloud of frogs, half seen in the gloom, the croaking of that hoarse multitude, those few red torches running and crossing each other in the darkness like the meteors which streak the misty surfaces of marshes, this whole scene produced upon her the effect of a mysterious battle between the phantoms of the witches' sabbath and the stone monsters of the church. Imbued from her very infancy with the superstitions of the Bohemian tribe, her first thought was that she had caught the strange beings peculiar to the night, in their deeds of witchcraft. Then she ran in terror to cower in her cell, asking of her pallet some less terrible nightmare.</div>

<div class="line_en">But little by little the first vapors of terror had been dissipated; from the constantly increasing noise, and from many other signs of reality, she felt herself besieged not by spectres, but by human beings. Then her fear, though it did not increase, changed its character. She had dreamed of the possibility of a popular mutiny to tear her from her asylum. The idea of once more recovering life, hope, Phoebus, who was ever present in her future, the extreme helplessness of her condition, flight cut off, no support, her abandonment, her isolation,-- these thoughts and a thousand others overwhelmed her. She fell upon her knees, with her head on her bed, her hands clasped over her head, full of anxiety and tremors, and, although a gypsy, an idolater, and a pagan, she began to entreat with sobs, mercy from the good Christian God, and to pray to our Lady, her hostess. For even if one believes in nothing, there are moments in life when one is always of the religion of the temple which is nearest at hand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，最初因恐惧而生的迷惘逐渐消散；她听见喊声不断增长，又觉察出其他一些现实迹象，逐渐明白过来：不是受到幽灵的围攻，而是受到人的围攻。于是，她的恐惧虽然没有增加，却改变了性质。她想，也许是民众叛乱，要把她从避难所抢夺出去。想到又要丧失性命，失去希望，丢弃她始终隐约寄予希望的孚比斯，而自己又是这样软弱无力，无路可逃，一无依靠，随命运播弄，孑然于世，形影相依，——诸如此类的想法使她完全丧失了力量。她跪下来，头伏在地铺上，合掌搂着脑袋，惶恐不安，浑身打战，虽然是个埃及姑娘、偶像崇拜者、异教徒，她也开始哭泣着祈求基督教的仁慈上帝的恩典，同时向庇护她的圣母祈祷。一个人尽管可以毫无宗教信仰，一生中也有这样的时刻：好歹依附于就近方便的庙宇所信奉的宗教。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She remained thus prostrate for a very long time, trembling in truth, more than praying, chilled by the ever-closer breath of that furious multitude, understanding nothing of this outburst, ignorant of what was being plotted, what was being done, what they wanted, but foreseeing a terrible issue.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她就这样久久匍匐于地，事实上战栗更多于祈祷，茫然感觉到下面狂暴群众的喘息越来越逼近，丝毫不能理解这场凶焰的由来，也根本不知道暗中在策划什么、他们在干什么、他们想要怎样，只是预感到可怕的结局。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The little goat had not, in fact, waited for Gringoire to announce his name. No sooner had he entered than it rubbed itself gently against his knees, covering the poet with caresses and with white hairs, for it was shedding its hair. Gringoire returned the caresses.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="确实，小山羊无需等待格兰古瓦自报姓名。他一进来，它就跳过去，亲热地蹭他的膝盖，在诗人身上蹭来蹭去，蹭得他全身都是白毛——因为它正在换毛的时期。格兰古瓦还它以抚爱。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This name reassured her. She raised her eyes once more, and recognized the poet in very fact. But there stood beside him a black figure veiled from head to foot, which struck her by its silence.</div>

Let us see, my Djali, hast thou forgotten any of thy pretty tricks? How does Master Jacques Charmolue?…"</div>

<div class="line_en">They rapidly descended the staircase of the towers, crossed the church, full of shadows and solitude, and all reverberating with uproar, which formed a frightful contrast, and emerged into the courtyard of the cloister by the red door. The cloister was deserted; the canons had fled to the bishop's palace in order to pray together; the courtyard was empty, a few frightened lackeys were crouching in dark corners. They directed their steps towards the door which opened from this court upon the Terrain. The man in black opened it with a key which he had about him. Our readers are aware that the Terrain was a tongue of land enclosed by walls on the side of the City and belonging to the chapter of Notre-Dame, which terminated the island on the east, behind the church. They found this enclosure perfectly deserted. There was here less tumult in the air. The roar of the outcasts' assault reached them more confusedly and less clamorously. The fresh breeze which follows the current of a stream, rustled the leaves of the only tree planted on the point of the Terrain, with a noise that was already perceptible. But they were still very close to danger. The nearest edifices to them were the bishop's palace and the church. It was plainly evident that there was great internal commotion in the bishop's palace. Its shadowy mass was all furrowed with lights which flitted from window to window; as, when one has just burned paper, there remains a sombre edifice of ashes in which bright sparks run a thousand eccentric courses. Beside them, the enormous towers of Notre-Dame, thus viewed from behind, with the long nave above which they rise cut out in black against the red and vast light which filled the Parvis, resembled two gigantic andirons of some cyclopean fire-grate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们急速跑下钟楼的楼梯，穿过教堂。教堂里一片漆黑，渺无人影，喧闹声却在里面回响，形成可怖的对比。然后，他们从红门走进修士庭院。院子里也见不着人，修士们都逃到主教府里去集体祷告了。庭院空荡荡的，只有几个张皇失措的仆役蜷缩在黑暗的角落里。他们走向庭院通至滩地的小门。黑衣人掏出一把钥匙，把门打开。读者知道，滩地是一长条河滩，向着内城一侧有墙围着，它隶属于圣母院的教士，构成主教堂后面城岛的东端。一看，院墙内外完全空荡荡的。到了那里，空中传来的喧闹声已经微弱，无赖汉进攻的吼叫，在他们听来，已不那么震耳欲聋，也比较模糊了。顺流吹拂的冷冽的风，搅动滩地尖端那棵独树的树叶，发出沙沙声，已经相当响亮地传来。不过，还没有完全脱离危险。距离最近的建筑物就是主教府和圣母院。而在主教府内显然是一片混乱。里面的灯光从一个窗口到一个窗口跳跃，时时划破了主教府那沉黑的庞大阴影，就好像刚刚烧过纸以后，留下的一大堆焦黑的灰烬，里面有跳跃的火花划出千百道奇特的花纹。旁边，圣母院的两座伟岸钟楼，这时从背后看，矗立在长条形中堂上面，衬托着前庭广场上烛天火光，刻印出黑色的剪影，好像巨人火炉里两根庞大炉衬。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The man with the lantern walked straight to the point of the Terrain. There, at the very brink of the water, stood the wormeaten remains of a fence of posts latticed with laths, whereon a low vine spread out a few thin branches like the fingers of an outspread hand. Behind, in the shadow cast by this trellis, a little boat lay concealed. The man made a sign to Gringoire and his companion to enter. The goat followed them. The man was the last to step in. Then he cut the boat's moorings, pushed it from the shore with a long boat-hook, and, seizing two oars, seated himself in the bow, rowing with all his might towards midstream. The Seine is very rapid at this point, and he had a good deal of trouble in leaving the point of the island.</div>

<div class="line_en">"On my soul!" exclaimed Gringoire suddenly, "we are as cheerful and joyous as young owls! We preserve the silence of Pythagoreans or fishes! Pasque-Dieu! my friends, I should greatly like to have some one speak to me. The human voice is music to the human ear. 'Tis not I who say that, but Didymus of Alexandria, and they are illustrious words. Assuredly, Didymus of Alexandria is no mediocre philosopher.-- One word, my lovely child! say but one word to me, I entreat you. By the way, you had a droll and peculiar little pout; do you still make it? Do you know, my dear, that parliament hath full jurisdiction over all places of asylum, and that you were running a great risk in your little chamber at Notre-Dame? Alas! the little bird trochylus maketh its nest in the jaws of the crocodile.-- Master, here is the moon re-appearing. If only they do not perceive us. We are doing a laudable thing in saving mademoiselle, and yet we should be hung by order of the king if we were caught. Alas! human actions are taken by two handles. That is branded with disgrace in one which is crowned in another. He admires Cicero who blames Catiline. Is it not so, master? What say you to this philosophy? I possess philosophy by instinct, by nature, ut apes geometriam.-- Come! no one answers me. What unpleasant moods you two are in! I must do all the talking alone. That is what we call a monologue in tragedy.-- Pasque-Dieu! I must inform you that I have just seen the king, Louis XI., and that I have caught this oath from him,-- Pasque-Dieu! They are still making a hearty howl in the city.—'Tis a villanous, malicious old king. He is all swathed in furs. He still owes me the money for my epithalamium, and he came within a nick of hanging me this evening, which would have been very inconvenient to me.-- He is niggardly towards men of merit. He ought to read the four books of Salvien of Cologne, Adversits Avaritiam. In truth! 'Tis a paltry king in his ways with men of letters, and one who commits very barbarous cruelties. He is a sponge, to soak money raised from the people. His saving is like the spleen which swelleth with the leanness of all the other members. Hence complaints against the hardness of the times become murmurs against the prince. Under this gentle and pious sire, the gallows crack with the hung, the blocks rot with blood, the prisons burst like over full bellies. This king hath one hand which grasps, and one which hangs. He is the procurator of Dame Tax and Monsieur Gibbet. The great are despoiled of their dignities, and the little incessantly overwhelmed with fresh oppressions. He is an exorbitant prince. I love not this monarch. And you, master?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="格兰古瓦突然喊道：“凭我的灵魂！我们真是轻松愉快，就跟猫头鹰崽子似的！可是都不做声，真像毕达哥拉斯的门徒，或者说，鱼一般的沉默。帕斯克—上帝！朋友们，我倒真想谁跟我说说话。人说话的声音，在人的耳朵听起来，就是音乐。这话可不是我说的，是亚历山大城的狄迪穆斯（1）说的，可谓至理名言呀！当然，亚历山大城的狄迪穆斯不是平平常常的哲学家。美丽的小姑娘，您跟我说一句话吧，我求求您！顺带说一句，您那样稍稍地一噘嘴，真别致，真有意思！您经常这样吗？亲爱的，您知道吗，大理寺对任何避难所都有完全司法权，您躲在圣母院还是有很大危险的？唉！小鹗鸟在鳄鱼嘴里筑巢呀（2）！……老师，月亮又出来了。但愿没有人看见我们！救出小姐，是大可赞扬的好事；可是，只要他们逮着我们，就会以国王的名义把我们绞死。唉！一切人的行为都有两端：人们谴责我的地方，恰恰是赞扬你的地方；赞美恺撒的人必定斥责卡蒂利纳（3）。不是吗，老师？您说这个哲理怎么样？我掌握哲学，就是凭持本能、发自天性的，ut apes geometriam（4）……算了，谁也不答理我！你们两个心绪多么恶劣！我只好一个人说话了。这就是我们在悲剧中所称的‘独白’。……帕斯克—上帝！我告诉你们，我刚才见着了国王路易十一，是从他那里学来的这句口头禅。真是帕斯克—上帝！内城那里还是喊声震天。……这个老国王是个大混蛋！里里外外都是皮袄、皮袍，欠我婚礼赞歌的钱却始终不给，就差刚才没把我绞死，——要是绞死，那我就讨不成债了！他对有德有才的人多么吝啬刻薄！他真应该好好念念科隆的萨耳维安的那四本书Adversus avaritiam（5）。真的，这个国王像那样对待文人真是心眼太狭窄，他还常干野蛮残暴的事情。他就像海绵吸尽老百姓的血汗钱！他的吝啬刻薄就像脾脏：身体的其他部分越消瘦，它就越肥大。因此，抱怨时世艰难的不满，都成了反对君王的牢骚。在这个温良笃诚的国王统治下，绞刑架上吊满了绞死的人，斩首台（6）上鲜血淋漓，牢房里关的人太多简直要挤炸了。这个国王一只手搜刮，一只手绞死人。他是加拜勒夫人和吉贝大人（7）的代诉人。大人物被剥夺荣华富贵，小人物备受压榨欺凌。这是一个敲骨吸髓的魔王。我不喜欢这个君主，您呢，老师？”【注：（1）亚历山大城的狄迪穆斯（311—398），有名的希腊盲哲学家。（2）传说，鹗鸟以剔食鳄鱼牙缝里的食物残渣为生。格兰古瓦认为，只要鳄鱼一合嘴，鹗鸟就会丧命。（3）卡蒂利纳（前109—前62），多次叛乱反对西塞罗。恺撒知情，参与了阴谋，但以后及早脱身，并利用了这几次叛乱。（4）拉丁文，就像蜜蜂会几何学一样。（5）《驳吝啬》。（6）原文是指初期斩首台上让犯人搁置脑袋等待屠刀落下的枕木。（7）加拜勒，意为“盐税”；吉贝：意为“绞架”。】">查看中文翻译</div>

A glimpse could be caught of him in the obscurity, in the bow of the boat, like a spectre. His cowl, which was still lowered, formed a sort of mask; and every time that he spread his arms, upon which hung large black sleeves, as he rowed, one would have said they were two huge bat's wings.

<div class="line_en">"Ah!" said Gringoire, "yonder is the Barbeau mansion.-- Stay, master, look: that group of black roofs which make such singular angles yonder, above that heap of black, fibrous grimy, dirty clouds, where the moon is completely crushed and spread out like the yolk of an egg whose shell is broken.—'Tis a fine mansion. There is a chapel crowned with a small vault full of very well carved enrichments. Above, you can see the bell tower, very delicately pierced. There is also a pleasant garden, which consists of a pond, an aviary, an echo, a mall, a labyrinth, a house for wild beasts, and a quantity of leafy alleys very agreeable to Venus. There is also a rascal of a tree which is called 'the lewd,' because it favored the pleasures of a famous princess and a constable of France, who was a gallant and a wit.-- Alas! we poor philosophers are to a constable as a plot of cabbages or a radish bed to the garden of the Louvre. What matters it, after all? human life, for the great as well as for us, is a mixture of good and evil. Pain is always by the side of joy, the spondee by the dactyl.-- Master, I must relate to you the history of the Barbeau mansion. It ends in tragic fashion. It was in 1319, in the reign of Philippe V., the longest reign of the kings of France. The moral of the story is that the temptations of the flesh are pernicious and malignant. Let us not rest our glance too long on our neighbor's wife, however gratified our senses may be by her beauty. Fornication is a very libertine thought. Adultery is a prying into the pleasures of others -- Ohé! the noise yonder is redoubling!"</div>

<div class="line_en">The tumult around Notre-Dame was, in fact, increasing. They listened. Cries of victory were heard with tolerable distinctness. All at once, a hundred torches, the light of which glittered upon the helmets of men at arms, spread over the church at all heights, on the towers, on the galleries, on the flying buttresses.

He was thinking that the goat also, "according to existing law," would be hung if recaptured; which would be a great pity, poor Djali! that he had thus two condemned creatures attached to him; that his companion asked no better than to take charge of the gypsy. A violent combat began between his thoughts, in which, like the Jupiter of the Iliad, he weighed in turn the gypsy and the goat; and he looked at them alternately with eyes moist with tears, saying between his teeth: "But I cannot save you both!"</div>

The unknown rose, approached the gypsy, and endeavored to take her arm to assist her to alight. She repulsed him and clung to the sleeve of Gringoire, who, in his turn, absorbed in the goat, almost repulsed her. Then she sprang alone from the boat. She was so troubled that she did not know what she did or whither she was going. Thus she remained for a moment, stunned, watching the water flow past; when she gradually returned to her senses, she found herself alone on the wharf with the unknown.

It was the hour when the earliest windows of the great city open joyously on the roofs. Some workmen, a few fruit-sellers on their way to the markets on their asses, began to traverse the Grève; they halted for a moment before this group of soldiers clustered round the Rat-Hole, stared at it with an air of astonishment and passed on.</div>

It is quite a history. Consider that I knew the sergeants very well. They were always good to me in the days when the little boys threw stones at me, because I led a life of pleasure. Do you see? You will leave me my child when you know! I was a poor woman of the town. It was the Bohemians who stole her from me. And I kept her shoe for fifteen years. Stay, here it is. That was the kind of foot which she had. At Reims! La Chantefleurie! Rue Folle-Peine! Perchance, you knew about that. It was I. In your youth, then, there was a merry time, when one passed good hours. You will take pity on me, will you not, gentlemen? The gypsies stole her from me; they hid her from me for fifteen years. I thought her dead. Fancy, my good friends, believed her to be dead. I have passed fifteen years here in this cellar, without a fire in winter. It is hard. The poor, dear little shoe! I have cried so much that the good God has heard me. This night he has given my daughter back to me. It is a miracle of the good God. She was not dead. You will not take her from me, I am sure. If it were myself, I would say nothing; but she, a child of sixteen! Leave her time to see the sun! What has she done to you? nothing at all. Nor have I. If you did but know that she is all I have, that I am old, that she is a blessing which the Holy Virgin has sent to me! And then, you are all so good! You did not know that she was my daughter; but now you do know it. Oh! I love her! Monsieur, the grand provost. I would prefer a stab in my own vitals to a scratch on her finger! You have the air of such a good lord! What I have told you explains the matter, does it not? Oh! if you have had a mother, monsiegneur! you are the captain, leave me my child! Consider that I pray you on my knees, as one prays to Jesus Christ! I ask nothing of any one; I am from Reims, gentlemen; I own a little field inherited from my uncle, Mahiet Pradon. I am no beggar. I wish nothing, but I do want my child! oh! I want to keep my child! The good God, who is the master, has not given her back to me for nothing! The king! you say the king! It would not cause him much pleasure to have my little daughter killed! And then, the king is good! she is my daughter! she is my own daughter! She belongs not to the king! she is not yours! I want to go away! we want to go away! and when two women pass, one a mother and the other a daughter, one lets them go! Let us pass! we belong in Reims.

The unfortunate child felt the horrible touch of the hemp. She raised her eyelids, and saw the fleshless arm of the stone gallows extended above her head. Then she shook herself and shrieked in a loud and heartrending voice: "No! no! I will not!" Her mother, whose head was buried and concealed in her daughter's garments, said not a word; only her whole body could be seen to quiver, and she was heard to redouble her kisses on her child. The executioner took advantage of this moment to hastily loose the arms with which she clasped the condemned girl. Either through exhaustion or despair, she let him have his way.
