<div class="line_en">Common chimpanzees live in communities of up to 150 individuals who occupy a distinct territory. As chimpanzees forage for the fruit and nuts that are unevenly distributed through the forest, they frequently split and coalesce into smaller groups ranging in size from one to fifteen. If one group encounters another group from a different community at the border between their territories, the interaction is always hostile. When the groups are evenly matched, they dispute the boundary in a noisy battle. The two sides bark, hoot, shake branches, throw objects, and charge at each other for half an hour or more, until one side, usually the smaller one, skulks away.</div>

<div class="line_en">How far back can we trace the history of violence? Though the primate ancestors of the human lineage have long been extinct, they left us with at least one kind of evidence about what they might have been like: their other descendants, chimpanzees. We did not, of course, evolve from chimps, and as we shall see it's an open question whether chimpanzees preserved the traits of our common ancestor or veered off in a uniquely chimp direction. But either way, chimpanzee aggression holds a lesson for us, because it shows how violence can evolve in a primate species with certain traits we share. And it tests the evolutionary prediction that violent tendencies are not hydraulic but strategic, deployed only in circumstances in which the potential gains are high and the risks are low.</div>

<div class="line_en">These battles are examples of the aggressive displays that are common among animals. Once thought to be rituals that settle disputes without bloodshed for the good of the species, they are now understood as displays of strength and resolve that allow the weaker side to concede when the outcome of a fight is a foregone conclusion and going through with it would only risk injury to both. When two animals are evenly matched, the show of force may escalate to serious fighting, and one or both can get injured or killed. Battles between groups of chimpanzees, however, do not escalate into serious fighting, and anthropologists once believed that the species was essentially peaceful.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这种典型的炫耀实力的战斗，在动物中非常常见。人们一度认为这只是为了物种自身利益不流血而解决争端的仪式，现在人们对此的理解是，这是武力和决心的宣示，既然战斗的输赢结果显而易见，而战斗的过程会给双方都造成伤害，一番吵闹之后，弱势的一方就应该让步了。如果双方完全势均力敌，炫耀武力就有可能让冲突升级，引发恶斗，其中一方，甚至双方，都有可能受伤或丧命。在黑猩猩群体之间的冲突不会升级为血腥恶斗，人类学家一度认为它们是本性和平的物种。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jane Goodall, the primatologist who first observed chimpanzees in the wild for extended periods of time, eventually made a shocking discovery. When a group of male chimpanzees encounters a smaller group or a solitary individual from another community, they don't hoot and bristle, but take advantage of their numbers. If the stranger is a sexually receptive adolescent female, they may groom her and try to mate. If she is carrying an infant, they will often attack her and kill and eat the baby. And if they encounter a solitary male, or isolate one from a small group, they will go after him with murderous savagery. Two attackers will hold down the victim, and the others will beat him, bite off his toes and genitals, tear flesh from his body, twist his limbs, drink his blood, or rip out his trachea. In one community, the chimpanzees picked off every male in a neighboring one, an event that if it occurred among humans we would call genocide. Many of the attacks aren't triggered by chance encounters but are the outcome of border patrols in which a group of males quietly seek out and target any solitary male they spot. Killings can also occur within a community. A gang of males may kill a rival, and a strong female, aided by a male or another female, may kill a weaker one's offspring.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="珍·古道尔（Jane Goodall）是第一个在野外对黑猩猩从事过长期观察的灵长类动物学家，她得出了一个惊人的发现。当一组雄性黑猩猩遭遇只数很少的，或者单只的来自其他群体的黑猩猩时，它们既不吼叫也不吹毛瞪眼，而是立即利用数量优势采取行动。如果这位陌生者是发情期的青少年雌性，它们可能会抚弄她，尝试交配。如果她带着自己的幼崽，它们就会攻击她，杀死并吃掉幼崽。而如果它们遭遇单只的雄性黑猩猩，或者能够从一小群中孤立出一只黑猩猩，它们会对其施以野性的残杀。进攻方的两只黑猩猩按住受害者，其他黑猩猩则开始打它，咬掉它的脚趾和生殖器，撕碎它的身体，扭断它的四肢，喝它的血，或者掐断它的气管。曾有一群黑猩猩，一个接一个地杀害了一个相邻社群中所有的雄性黑猩猩。在人类，这样的行为就是大屠杀。黑猩猩之间这样的攻击大多不是偶发的遭遇战，而是边界巡视的结果，进行边界巡查的雄性黑猩猩团组悄无声息地搜索并锁定单只的雄性。社群内部也会发生残杀。一伙雄性黑猩猩会联手杀死一个对头，一只雌性黑猩猩也会在一只雄性或一只雌性同伙的协助下，杀害另一只处于弱势的雌性黑猩猩的后代。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Does chimpicide have a Darwinian rationale? The primatologist Richard Wrangham, a former student of Goodall's, has tested various hypotheses with the extensive data that have been amassed on the demography and ecology of chimpanzees. He was able to document one large Darwinian advantage and one smaller one. When chimpanzees eliminate rival males and their offspring, they expand their territory, either by moving into it immediately or by winning subsequent battles with the help of their enhanced numerical advantage. This allows them to monopolize access to the territory's food for themselves, their offspring, and the females they mate with, which in turn results in a greater rate of births among the females. The community will also sometimes absorb the females of the vanquished community, bringing the males a second reproductive advantage. It's not that the chimps fight directly over food or females. All they care about is dominating their territory and eliminating rivals if they can do so at minimal risk to themselves. The evolutionary benefits happen indirectly and over the long run.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="达尔文主义的基本原理是否适用于黑猩猩？灵长类动物学家，曾经是古道尔学生的理查德·兰厄姆（Richard Wrangham），收集了有关黑猩猩的种群学和生态学的大量数据，对几种假说进行了测试。他记录到一大一小两个达尔文自然选择优势。一旦黑猩猩消灭掉雄性对手及其后代，它们或者立即迁入对手的家园，扩张自己领地，或者依仗自己越来越强的数量优势继续进攻，连战连胜。这样，它们为自己、自己的后代和与自己交配的雌性，垄断了领地内的食物资源，结果就是雌性黑猩猩的生育率上升。强势社群有时也吸纳消亡社群的雌性黑猩猩，给雄性带来第二次繁殖优势。黑猩猩并不是直接为获取食物和雌性配偶而打斗。它们关心的仅仅是统治自己的领地和在对自身风险最小的前提下消灭对手。进化的收益是间接的，而且非常漫长。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Goodall first wrote about these killings, other scientists wondered whether they might be freak outbursts, symptoms of pathology, or artifacts of the primatologists' provisioning the chimps with food to make them easier to observe. Three decades later little doubt remains that lethal aggression is a part of chimpanzees' normal behavioral repertoire. Primatologists have observed or inferred the killings of almost fifty individuals in attacks between communities, and more than twenty-five in attacks within them. The reports have come from at least nine communities, including ones that have never been provisioned. In some communities, more than a third of the males die from violence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当珍·古道尔第一次对这些杀戮做出描述时，其他科学家们怀疑，这些被观察的黑猩猩是否受到了惊吓，或是患病，或者因为灵长类动物学家为了观察的方便，给黑猩猩喂食了人类自己的加工食品。30年之后，已经没有人再怀疑，这些致命性侵犯属于黑猩猩的常规行为。灵长类动物学家已经观察到或推断出近50起社群之间的杀戮，还有至少25起社群内部的杀戮。这些报告涵盖至少9个社群，其中一个从未被人投食喂养过。在某些社群，超过1/3的雄性死于暴力。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">What does this have to do with violence in humans? It raises the possibility that the human lineage has been engaged in lethal raiding since the time of its common root with chimpanzees around six million years ago. There is, however, an alternative possibility. The shared ancestor of humans and common chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) bequeathed the world a third species, bonobos or pygmy chimps (Pan paniscus), which split from their common cousins around two million years ago. We are as closely related to bonobos as we are to common chimps, and bonobos never engage in lethal raiding. Indeed, the difference between bonobos and common chimpanzees is one of the best-known facts in popular primatology. Bonobos have become famous as the peaceable, matriarchal, concupiscent, herbivorous "hippie chimps." They are the namesake of a vegetarian restaurant in New York, the inspiration for the sexologist Dr. Suzy's "Bonobo Way of Peace Through Pleasure," and if the New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd had her way, a role model for men today.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些和人类的暴力到底有什么关系呢？它提出了这样一种可能性，人类和黑猩猩的共同祖先可以追溯到约600万年前，从那时起，人类的先祖很可能进行过与今天黑猩猩同样的杀戮。当然，还存在另外一种可能性。人类和黑猩猩（Pan troglodytes）的共享祖先还给世界留下了第三个物种，倭黑猩猩（又名矮黑猩猩或侏儒黑猩猩）（Pan paniscus），它们在200万年前与表兄弟分手，演化为独立的物种。人类与倭黑猩猩和黑猩猩同属近亲，而倭黑猩猩从来不进行致命性攻击。倭黑猩猩和黑猩猩之间的这一差异确实是大众动物学上最为人津津乐道的现象之一。倭黑猩猩成为出名的爱好和平、母权制、充满情欲和素食的“嬉皮猩猩”。它们成为纽约素菜馆的店名，给性学家苏西博士哲学灵感——“倭黑猩猩之路：通过快乐达致和平”，而《纽约时报》专栏作家莫林·多德（Maureen Dowd）干脆表示，它们是当今男人们的楷模。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As for the risks, the chimpanzees minimize them by picking unfair fights, those in which they outnumber their victim by at least three to one. The foraging pattern of chimpanzees often delivers an unlucky victim into their clutches because fruiting trees are distributed patchily in the forest. Hungry chimps may have to forage in small groups or on their own and may sometimes venture into no-chimp's-land in pursuit of their dinner.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="至于风险，黑猩猩降低风险的方法就是欺负弱小，它们只在数量占据优势时开战，通常至少要有3∶1的优势。因为果树是散布在森林中的，黑猩猩的觅食方式经常将倒霉的受害者送入魔爪。有些黑猩猩迫于饥饿，不得不结成很小的群组甚至单个外出采集食物，为了一顿晚餐，冒险进入无主的真空地带。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The primatologist Frans de Waal points out that in theory the common ancestor of humans, common chimpanzees, and bonobos could have been similar to bonobos rather than to common chimps. If so, violence between coalitions of males would have shallower roots in human evolutionary history. Common chimpanzees and humans would have developed their lethal raiding independently, and human raiding may have developed historically in particular cultures rather than evolutionarily in the species. If so, humans would have no innate proclivities toward coalitional violence and would not need a Leviathan, or any other institution, to keep them away from it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="灵长类动物学家弗朗斯·德·瓦尔（Frans de Waal）表示，在理论上，人类、黑猩猩和倭黑猩猩的共同祖先，很可能更接近倭黑猩猩，而不是黑猩猩。据此，男性群体间的暴力在人类演化历史上并非根深蒂固。黑猩猩和人类各自发展了自己的致命攻击行为，而人类的攻击性很可能是特定文化的历史产物，而不是物种演化的结果。那么，如果人类不是天性倾向群体暴力，也就不需要一个利维坦，或者任何其他组织机构来控制人类的暴力。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The idea that humans evolved from a peaceful, bonobolike ancestor has two problems. One is that it is easy to get carried away with the hippie-chimp story. Bonobos are an endangered species that lives in inaccessible forests in dangerous parts of the Congo, and much of what we know about them comes from observations of small groups of well-fed juveniles or young adults in captivity. Many primatologists suspect that systematic studies of older, hungrier, more populous, and freer groups of bonobos would paint a darker picture. Bonobos in the wild, it turns out, engage in hunting, confront each other belligerently, and injure one another in fights, perhaps sometimes fatally. So while bonobos are unquestionably less aggressive than common chimpanzees -- they never raid one another, and communities can mingle peacefully -- they are certainly not peaceful across the board.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这种认为人类是从爱好和平的、倭黑猩猩式的始祖演化而来的观点有两个问题。第一个问题是，人们很容易被嬉皮猩猩的故事搞得忘乎理智。倭黑猩猩是濒临绝迹的稀有物种，数量极少，而且生活在刚果危机四伏、孤立隔绝的原始森林中。我们对倭黑猩猩的大部分知识，都来自对一小群圈养的、食物充足的幼年或青年倭黑猩猩的观察。许多科学家怀疑，如果能够对更年长的、饥肠辘辘的、数量更多也更密集的、活动更自由的倭黑猩猩进行系统的研究，勾勒出的画面也许会相当阴暗。事实证明，在野外的倭黑猩猩从事捕猎，相互间激烈打斗，在争斗中互有伤害，有时也可以是致命的。所以，尽管倭黑猩猩无疑要比黑猩猩更少侵犯性，它们不会互相杀戮，社群之间可以和平地相处，但它们也不是绝对和平的。">查看中文翻译</div>

</div>
<div class="line_en">The second and more important problem is that the common ancestor of the two chimpanzee species and humans is far more likely to have been like a common chimpanzee than like a bonobo. Bonobos are very strange primates, not just in their behavior but in their anatomy. Their small, childlike heads, lighter bodies, reduced sex differences, and other juvenile traits make them different not only from common chimpanzees but from the other great apes (gorillas and orangutans) and different as well from fossil australopithecines, who were ancestral to humans. Their distinctive anatomy, when placed on the great ape family tree, suggests that bonobos were pulled away from the generic ape plan by neoteny, a process that retunes an animal's growth program to preserve certain juvenile features in adulthood (in the case of bonobos, features of the cranium and brain). Neoteny often occurs in species that have undergone domestication, as when dogs diverged from wolves, and it is a pathway by which selection can make animals less aggressive. Wrangham argues that the primary mover in bonobo evolution was selection for reduced aggression in males, perhaps because bonobos forage in large groups without vulnerable loners, so there are no opportunities for coalitional aggression to pay off. These considerations suggest that bonobos are the odd-ape-out, and we are descended from an animal that was closer to common chimpanzees.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二个，也是更重要的问题是，两种猩猩和人类的共同祖先事实上更接近黑猩猩，而不是倭黑猩猩。倭黑猩猩是一种非常古怪的灵长类，它们不仅行为古怪，其解剖学特征也非常奇特。它们有细小的、孩子般的头颅，体型轻巧，性别差异缩小，这些都是幼态化特性，这让它们与黑猩猩和其他大猿猴（大猩猩和猩猩），以及人类的始祖更新纪灵长类的化石都非常不同。它们这种与众不同的解剖特性，说明倭黑猩猩出现幼态持续，即动物调整其成长过程，将幼态状态保留在成熟体中（比如倭黑猩猩的头颅和大脑），因此在大猿猴家族的族谱上，倭黑猩猩越来越偏离猿猴的属性。幼态持续一般发生在被驯化的物种身上，比如狗是从狼分离而来的，它的筛选过程就是减少动物的攻击性。兰厄姆认为，倭黑猩猩的进化筛选降低了雄性的攻击性，这也许是因为倭黑猩猩采取大团组觅食，不存在易受攻击的独行者，所以群体暴力没有获益的机会。也就是说，倭黑猩猩是猿猴家族的异类，而我们人类则是更接近黑猩猩的动物。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It would be nice if the gap between the common ancestor and modern humans could be filled in by the fossil record. But chimpanzees' ancestors have left no fossils, and hominid fossils and artifacts are too scarce to provide direct evidence of aggression, such as preserved weapons or wounds. Some paleoanthropologists test for signs of a violent temperament in fossil species by measuring the size of the canine teeth in males (since daggerlike canines are found in aggressive species) and by looking for differences in the size of the males and the females (since males tend to be larger in polygynous species, the better to fight with other males). Unfortunately the small jaws of hominids, unlike the muzzles of other primates, don't open wide enough for large canines to be practical, regardless of how aggressive or peaceful these creatures were. And unless a species was considerate enough to have left behind a large number of complete skeletons, it's hard to sex them reliably and compare the size of the males and the females. (For these reasons many anthropologists are skeptical of the recent claim that Ardipithecus ramidus, a 4.4-million-year-old species that is probably ancestral to Homo, was unisex and small-canined and hence monogamous and peaceable.) The more recent and abundant Homo fossils show that the males have been larger than the females for at least two million years, by at least as great a ratio as in modern humans. This reinforces the suspicion that violent competition among men has a long history in our evolutionary lineage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，我们希望能够发现化石，填补共同祖先和现代人类之间的空白。但是，黑猩猩的祖先没有留下任何化石，原始人类的化石和留下的遗物也十分罕见，不足以提供任何攻击性行为的直接证据，比如保留完好的武器和创伤这样的证据。因为在侵犯性的物种身上发现了剑状的犬齿，一些古人类学者通过测量雄性化石的犬齿，以及雄性犬齿与雌性犬齿之间的差异（因为在实行一夫多妻制的物种中，雄性体型较大，与其他雄性的冲突也更频繁），来寻找其暴力倾向的迹象。很不幸，与其他灵长类相比，不论原始人科是爱好和平还是富于侵犯性，这类造物的口腔太小，张合度不够，不允许大型犬齿发挥作用。除非一个物种留下大量的完整骸骨，很难可靠地确定它们的性别，也就无法比较雄性和雌性之间的体积差异。（出于这一原因，对于认为新近发现的拉密达猿人，这个440万年前的古老物种有可能是人类的始祖，许多人类学家是心存疑问的。拉密达猿人无性别差异，而且是小犬齿，因此是一夫一妻制并爱好和平的。）最新发现的更丰富的人属（Homo）化石显示，至少在200万年前开始，人属的雄性体格就大于雌性，性别差异程度至少和现代人是一样的。这印证了我们的猜测，即男子之间的暴力竞争在进化谱系上有着漫长的历史。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Even if common chimps and humans discovered coalitional violence independently, the coincidence would be informative. It would suggest that lethal raiding can be evolutionarily advantageous in an intelligent species that fissions into groups of various sizes, and in which related males form coalitions and can assess each other's relative strength. When we look at violence in humans later in the chapter, we will see that some of the parallels are a bit close for comfort.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="即使黑猩猩和人类各自独立地发展出群体暴力习性，这种巧合本身也含有丰富的信息。这也许说明，致命攻击对智能物种而言是一种进化上的优势，如果这一物种以不同规模的团伙形式存在，有亲缘关系的雄性结成联盟，而且能够判断彼此的相对实力。本书后面的章节会谈及人类的暴力行为，我们会看到人类和黑猩猩这两条平行线，有时实在是过于接近了。">查看中文翻译</div>
