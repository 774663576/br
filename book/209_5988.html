<div class="line_en">He came, and in such very good time that the ladies were none of them dressed. In ran Mrs. Bennet to her daughter's room, in her dressing gown, and with her hair half finished, crying out, "My dear Jane, make haste and hurry down.

<div class="line_en">The same anxiety to get them by themselves was visible again in the evening. After tea, Mr. Bennet retired to the library, as was his custom, and Mary went up stairs to her instrument. Two obstacles of the five being thus removed, Mrs. Bennet sat looking and winking at Elizabeth and Catherine for a considerable time, without making any impression on them. Elizabeth would not observe her; and when at last Kitty did, she very innocently said, "What is the matter mamma? What do you keep winking at me for? What am I to do?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到了下午，显见得班纳特太太又一心要成全他们两人在一起。喝过了茶，班纳特先生照着他平常的习惯，到书房里去了，曼丽上楼弹琴去了。班太太看见五个障碍去了两个，便立刻对伊丽莎白和咖苔琳挤眉弄眼，吉蒂终于很天真地说：“怎么啦，妈妈？你为什么老是对我眨眼？你要我做什么呀？”">查看中文翻译</div>

She then sat still five minutes longer; but unable to waste such a precious occasion, she suddenly got up, and saying to Kitty, "Come here, my love, I want to speak to you," took her out of the room. Jane instantly gave a look at Elizabeth which spoke her distress at such premeditation, and her intreaty that she would not give in to it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没什么，孩子，没什么。我没有对你眨眼。”于是她又多坐了五分钟，实在不愿意再错过这大好的机会，她便突然站起来，对吉蒂说：“来，宝贝，我跟你说句话，”说过这话，她便把吉蒂拉了出去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mrs. Bennet's schemes for this day were ineffectual. Bingley was every thing that was charming, except the professed lover of her daughter. His ease and cheerfulness rendered him a most agreeable addition to their evening party; and he bore with the ill-judged officiousness of the mother, and heard all her silly remarks with a forbearance and command of countenance particularly grateful to the daughter.</div>

<div class="line_en">After this day, Jane said no more of her indifference. Not a word passed between the sisters concerning Bingley; but Elizabeth went to bed in the happy belief that all must speedily be concluded, unless Mr. Darcy returned within the stated time. Seriously, however, she felt tolerably persuaded that all this must have taken place with that gentleman's concurrence.</div>

<div class="line_en">Bingley was punctual to his appointment; and he and Mr. Bennet spent the morning together, as had been agreed on. The latter was much more agreeable than his companion expected. There was nothing of presumption or folly in Bingley that could provoke his ridicule, or disgust him into silence; and he was more communicative, and less eccentric, than the other had ever seen him. Bingley of course returned with him to dinner; and in the evening Mrs. Bennet's invention was again at work to get every body away from him and her daughter. Elizabeth, who had a letter to write, went into the breakfast room for that purpose soon after tea; for as the others were all going to sit down to cards, she could not be wanted to counteract her mother's schemes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天彬格莱准时赴约，依照事先约定，跟班纳特先生在一起消磨了整个上午。班纳特先生和蔼可亲，实在远远出乎彬格莱先生的意料。这是因为，彬格莱没有什么傲慢或愚蠢的地方惹他嘲笑，或是叫他讨厌得不肯理睬他。比起彬格莱上次跟他见面的情形来，他这次更加健谈。也不象以前那样古怪。不用说，彬格莱跟他一同回来吃了中饭，晚上班纳特太太又设法把别人都遣开，让他跟她女儿在一起。伊丽莎白今晚有一封信要写吃，过茶以后，便到起坐间去写信，因为她看到别人都坐下打牌，不便再和她母亲作对。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But on returning to the drawing room, when her letter was finished, she saw, to her infinite surprise, there was reason to fear that her mother had been too ingenious for her. On opening the door, she perceived her sister and Bingley standing together over the hearth, as if engaged in earnest conversation; and had this led to no suspicion, the faces of both, as they hastily turned round and moved away from each other, would have told it all. Their situation was awkward enough; but her's she thought was still worse. Not a syllable was uttered by either; and Elizabeth was on the point of going away again, when Bingley, who as well as the other had sat down, suddenly rose, and whispering a few words to her sister, ran out of the room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等她写好了信回到客厅里来的时候，一看那种情景，不由得触目惊心，认为母亲果然比她聪明得多。且说她一走进门，只见姐姐和彬格莱一起站在壁炉跟前，看来正在谈话谈得起劲，如果这情形还没有什么可疑，那么，只消看看他们俩那般的脸色，那般慌慌张张转过身去，立即分开，你心里便有数了。他们窘态毕露，可是她自己却更窘。他们坐了下来，一言不发；伊丽莎白正待走开，只见彬格莱突然站起身来，跟她姐姐悄悄地说了几句话，便跑出去了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He then shut the door, and, coming up to her, claimed the good wishes and affection of a sister. Elizabeth honestly and heartily expressed her delight in the prospect of their relationship. They shook hands with great cordiality; and then, till her sister came down, she had to listen to all he had to say of his own happiness, and of Jane's perfections; and in spite of his being a lover, Elizabeth really believed all his expectations of felicity to be rationally founded, because they had for basis the excellent understanding, and super-excellent disposition of Jane, and a general similarity of feeling and taste between her and himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他于是关上了门，走到她跟前，让她亲切地祝贺姐夫。伊丽莎白真心诚意地说，她为他们俩未来的美满姻缘感到欣喜。两人亲切地握了握手。她只听得他讲他自己的幸福，讲吉英的十全十美，一直讲到吉英下楼为止。虽然这些话是出于一个情人之口，可是她深信他那幸福的愿望一定可以实现，因为吉英绝顶聪明，脾气更是好得不能再好，这便是幸福的基础，而且他们彼此的性格和趣味也十分相近。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This naturally introduced a panegyric from Jane on his diffidence, and the little value he put on his own good qualities. Elizabeth was pleased to find that he had not betrayed the interference of his friend; for, though Jane had the most generous and forgiving heart in the world, she knew it was a circumstance which must prejudice her against him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉英听了这话，自然又赞美起他的虚心来，赞美他虽然具有了许多优美的品质，可并不自以为了不起。伊丽莎白高兴的是，彬格莱并没有把他朋友阻挡这件事的经过泄露出来，因为吉英虽然宽宏大量，不记仇隙，可是这件事如果让她知道了，她一定会对达西有成见。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The situation of affairs in the Longbourn family could not be long a secret. Mrs. Bennet was privileged to whisper it to Mrs. Philips, and she ventured, without any permission, to do the same by all her neighbours in Meryton.
