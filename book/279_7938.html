<div class="line_en">A few minutes later Tom was in the shoal water of the bar, wading toward the Illinois shore. Before the depth reached his middle he was half–way over; the current would permit no more wading, now, so he struck out confidently to swim the remaining hundred yards. He swam quartering upstream, but still was swept downward rather faster than he had expected. However, he reached the shore finally, and drifted along till he found a low place and drew himself out. He put his hand on his jacket pocket, found his piece of bark safe, and then struck through the woods, following the shore, with streaming garments. Shortly before ten o'clock he came out into an open place opposite the village, and saw the ferryboat lying in the shadow of the trees and the high bank. Everything was quiet under the blinking stars. He crept down the bank, watching with all his eyes, slipped into the water, swam three or four strokes and climbed into the skiff that did "yawl" duty at the boat's stern. He laid himself down under the thwarts and waited, panting.</div>

<div class="line_en">Presently the cracked bell tapped and a voice gave the order to "cast off." A minute or two later the skiff's head was standing high up, against the boat's swell, and the voyage was begun. Tom felt happy in his success, for he knew it was the boat's last trip for the night. At the end of a long twelve or fifteen minutes the wheels stopped, and Tom slipped overboard and swam ashore in the dusk, landing fifty yards downstream, out of danger of possible stragglers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不久，船上的破钟敲响了，有人发出了“开船”的命令。一两分钟以后，小艇的船头被渡船裹挟的排浪冲得直竖起来，船启航了。汤姆庆幸自己赶上了这班船，他知道这可是当晚的最后一次摆渡了。好不容易熬过了这漫长的十二到十五分种，渡船终于停了下来，汤姆从小艇上溜下水，在暮色中向岸边游去，为了不让人遇见，他在下游五十码的地方安全地上了岸。他飞快地穿过冷冷清清的小巷，转眼间就到了姨妈家的后围墙下。他翻过围墙，走近厢房，见客厅的窗户里有光亮他就朝里张望，屋里坐着波莉姨妈、希德、玛丽，还有乔·哈帕的妈妈，大家正在聚谈。他们坐在床边，床摆在他们和门之间。汤姆走到门边，轻轻地拨开门闩，随后慢慢地推了一下，门狭开了一条缝。他又小心翼翼地推门。每次门响一声，他都吓得发抖，后来他估计可以趴着挤进去时，就把头先伸进去，心惊胆战地开始往里爬。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He flew along unfrequented alleys, and shortly found himself at his aunt's back fence. He climbed over, approached the "ell," and looked in at the sitting–room window, for a light was burning there. There sat Aunt Polly, Sid, Mary, and Joe Harper's mother, grouped together, talking. They were by the bed, and the bed was between them and the door. Tom went to the door and began to softly lift the latch; then he pressed gently and the door yielded a crack; he continued pushing cautiously, and quaking every time it creaked, till he judged he might squeeze through on his knees; so he put his head through and began, warily.</div>

<div class="line_en">"But as I was saying," said Aunt Polly, "he warn't BAD, so to say -- only mischEEvous. Only just giddy, and harum–scarum, you know. He warn't any more responsible than a colt. HE never meant any harm, and he was the best–hearted boy that ever was" -- and she began to cry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但是，就像我刚才说的，”波莉姨妈说，“他不坏，可以这么说——他不过是淘气罢了，有点浮躁冒冒失失的。他只不过还是个毛头孩子。他可没有一点坏心眼，我从来还没见过像他那么心地善良的孩子。嘿……”她开始哭了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

God'll take care of HIM-never you trouble YOURself, sir! Oh, Mrs. Harper, I don't know how to give him up! I don't know how to give him up!

<div class="line_en">He went on listening, and gathered by odds and ends that it was conjectured at first that the boys had got drowned while taking a swim; then the small raft had been missed; next, certain boys said the missing lads had promised that the village should "hear something" soon; the wise–heads had "put this and that together" and decided that the lads had gone off on that raft and would turn up at the next town below, presently; but toward noon the raft had been found, lodged against the Missouri shore some five or six miles below the village -- and then hope perished; they must be drowned, else hunger would have driven them home by nightfall if not sooner. It was believed that the search for the bodies had been a fruitless effort merely because the drowning must have occurred in mid–channel, since the boys, being good swimmers, would otherwise have escaped to shore. This was Wednesday night. If the bodies continued missing until Sunday, all hope would be given over, and the funerals would be preached on that morning. Tom shuddered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他继续听着，从零零星星的谈话中得知，开头人们以为几个孩子在游泳中淹死了；其后他们又发现那只小木筏不见了；接着又有些孩子说这几个失踪的孩子曾暗示过镇上人不久将“听到重大新闻”；那些有头脑的聪明人根据东拼西凑的消息断定几个小家伙一定是撑着小木筏出去了，不久就会在下游的村镇里出现；但是时近中午，人们发现木筏停在镇子下游五六英里的密西西比河岸边——可孩子们不在上边，于是希望成了泡影，破灭了；他们准是淹死了，否则的话，不要到天黑，他们就会饿得往家来。大家认为打捞尸体是徒劳无获的，因为几个孩子一定是在河当中淹死的，要不然，凭他们那么好的水性，早就凫到岸上来了。今天是星期三晚上。要是到星期天还找不着尸体的话，那什么希望都没有了，星期天早上就举行丧礼。汤姆听到这里，浑身一阵簌簌乱抖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But this memory was too much for the old lady, and she broke entirely down. Tom was snuffling, now, himself-and more in pity of himself than anybody else. He could hear Mary crying, and putting in a kindly word for him from time to time. He began to have a nobler opinion of himself than ever before. Still, he was sufficiently touched by his aunt's grief to long to rush out from under the bed and overwhelm her with joy-and the theatrical gorgeousness of the thing appealed strongly to his nature, too, but he resisted and lay still.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="老太太说着说着，伤心得实在说不下去了，她一下子放声哭起来。此时的汤姆鼻子也发起酸来——这倒不是他在同情别人，而是在可怜自己。他听见玛丽也在哭，还时不时为他说上一两句好话。他从没有像现在这样感到自己是个不平凡的人。还有，姨妈伤心的样子深深地打动汤姆，他真想从床下面冲出来，让她惊喜欲狂——再说汤姆也十分喜欢制造些富于戏剧性的场景，但这一次他却沉住气，没有动弹。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mrs. Harper gave a sobbing good–night and turned to go. Then with a mutual impulse the two bereaved women flung themselves into each other's arms and had a good, consoling cry, and then parted. Aunt Polly was tender far beyond her wont, in her good–night to Sid and Mary. Sid snuffled a bit and Mary went off crying with all her heart.</div>

<div class="line_en">He had to keep still long after she went to bed, for she kept making broken–hearted ejaculations from time to time, tossing unrestfully, and turning over. But at last she was still, only moaning a little in her sleep. Now the boy stole out, rose gradually by the bedside, shaded the candle–light with his hand, and stood regarding her. His heart was full of pity for her. He took out his sycamore scroll and placed it by the candle. But something occurred to him, and he lingered considering. His face lighted with a happy solution of his thought; he put the bark hastily in his pocket. Then he bent over and kissed the faded lips, and straightway made his stealthy exit, latching the door behind him.</div>

<div class="line_en">He threaded his way back to the ferry landing, found nobody at large there, and walked boldly on board the boat, for he knew she was tenantless except that there was a watchman, who always turned in and slept like a graven image. He untied the skiff at the stern, slipped into it, and was soon rowing cautiously upstream. When he had pulled a mile above the village, he started quartering across and bent himself stoutly to his work. He hit the landing on the other side neatly, for this was a familiar bit of work to him. He was moved to capture the skiff, arguing that it might be considered a ship and therefore legitimate prey for a pirate, but he knew a thorough search would be made for it and that might end in revelations. So he stepped ashore and entered the woods.</div>

It was broad daylight before he found himself fairly abreast the island bar.
