<div class="line_en">The villagers of Little Hangleron still called it "the Riddle House," even though it had been many years since the Riddle family had lived there. It stood on a hill overlooking the village, some of its windows boarded, tiles missing from its roof, and ivy spreading unchecked over its face. Once a fine-looking manor, and easily the largest and grandest building for miles around, the Riddle House was now damp, derelict, and unoccupied.</div>

<div class="line_en">The story had been picked over so many times, and had been embroidered in so many places, that nobody was quite sure what the truth was anymore. Every version of the tale, however, started in the same place: Fifty years before, at daybreak on a fine summer's morning when the Riddle House had still been well kept and impressive, a maid had entered the drawing room to find all three Riddles dead.</div>

Nobody else in the village had seen any such boy, and the police were quite sure Frank had invented him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他说，在里德尔一家死去的那天，他在宅子附近见到的惟一的人是一个他不认识的十多岁男孩，那男孩头发黑黑的，脸色苍白。村里的其他人都没有见过这样一个男孩，警察们认定这是弗兰克凭空编造的。">查看中文翻译</div>

A team of doctors had examined the bodies and had concluded that none of the Riddles had been poisoned, stabbed, shot, strangles, suffocated, or (as far as they could tell) harmed at all. In fact (the report continued, in a tone of unmistakable bewilderment), the Riddles all appeared to be in perfect health -- apart from the fact that they were all dead.

<div class="line_en">The wealthy man who owned the Riddle House these days neither lived there nor put it to any use; they said in the village that he kept it for "tax reasons," though nobody was very clear what these might be.

<div class="line_en">Weeds were not the only things Frank had to contend with either. Boys from the village made a habit of throwing stones through the windows of the Riddle House. They rode their bicycles over the lawns Frank worked so hard to keep smooth. Once or twice, they broke into the old house for a dare. They knew that old Frank's devotion to the house and the grounds amounted almost to an obsession, and it amused them to see him limping across the garden, brandishing his stick and yelling croakily at them. Frank, for his part, believed the boys tormented him because they, like their parents and grandparents, though him a murderer. So when Frank awoke one night in August and saw something very odd up at the old house, he merely assumed that the boys had gone one step further in their attempts to punish him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="况且，弗兰克要对付的不仅是杂草。村子里的男孩总喜欢往里德尔府的窗户上扔石头。弗兰克费了很大心血才保持了草地的平整，他们却骑着自行车在上面随意碾踏。有一两次，他们为了互相打赌，还闯进了老宅。他们知道老弗兰克一心一意地护理宅子和庭园，几乎到了一种痴迷的程度，所以他们愿意看到他一瘸一拐地穿过园子，挥舞着拐杖，用沙哑的嗓子朝他们嚷嚷，每当这时，他们就觉得特别开心。弗兰克呢，他相信这些男孩之所以折磨他，是因为他们和他们的父母、祖父母一样，认为他是一个杀人犯。因此，在那个八月的夜晚，当弗兰克一觉醒来，看见老宅上面有异常的动静时，还以为是那些男孩又想出了新的花招来惩罚他了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was Frank's bad leg that woke him; it was paining him worse than ever in his old age. He got up and limped downstairs into the kitchen with the idea of refilling his hot-water bottle to ease the stiffness in his knee. Standing at the sink, filling the kettle, he looked up at the Riddle House and saw lights glimmering in its upper windows.</div>

<div class="line_en">Frank had no telephone, in any case, he had deeply mistrusted the police ever since they had taken him in for questioning about the Riddles' deaths.

He picked up his walking stick, which was propped against the wall, and set off into the night.</div>

<div class="line_en">The front door of the Riddle House bore no sign of being forced, nor did any of the windows. Frank limped around to the back of the house until he reached a door almost completely hidden by ivy, took out the old key, put it into the lock, and opened the door noiselessly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="里德尔府的前门没有被人强行闯入的迹象，窗户也完好无损。弗兰克一瘸一拐地绕到房子后面，停在一扇几乎完全被爬山虎遮住的门边，掏出那把旧钥匙，插进锁孔，无声地打开了门。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He let himself into the cavernous kitchen. Frank had not entered it for many years; nevertheless, although it was very dark, he remembered where the door into the hall was, and he groped his way towards it, his nostrils full of the smell of decay, ears pricked for any sound of footsteps or voices from overhead. He reached the hall, which was a little lighter owing to the large mullioned windows on either side of the front door, and started to climb the stairs, blessing the dust that lay thick upon the stone, because it muffled the sound of his feet and stick.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弗兰克走进洞穴般幽暗的大厨房，他已经很多年没有进来过了。不过，尽管四下里漆黑一片，他仍记得通往走廊的门在哪里。他摸索着走过去，一股腐烂的味儿扑鼻而来。他竖起耳朵，捕捉着头顶上的每一丝脚步声或说话声。他来到走廊，这里因为有前门两边的大直棂窗，多少秀进一点儿光线。他开始上楼，一边心想多亏石阶上积着厚厚的灰尘，使他的脚步声和拐杖声发闷，不易被人察觉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“待一会儿吧。”又一个声音说。这也是一个男人——但嗓音却尖得奇怪，而且像寒风一样冰冷刺骨。不知怎的，这声音使弗兰克脖子后面稀少的头发都竖了起来。“把我挪到炉火边去，虫尾巴。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Frank turned his right ear toward the door, the better to hear. There came the clink of a bottle being put down upon some hard surface, and then the dull scraping noise of a heavy chair being dragged across the floor. Frank caught a glimpse of a small man, his back to the door, pushing the chair into place. He was wearing a long black cloak, and there was a bald patch at the back of his head. Then he went out of sight again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弗兰克把右耳贴到门上，想听得更清楚些。房间里传来一个瓶子放在某个坚硬的东西上的当啷声，然后是一把重重的椅子在地板上拖过时发出的刺耳的摩擦声。弗兰克瞥见一个小个子男人，背对着门，正在推动一把椅子。他穿着一件长长的黑斗篷，后脑勺上秃了一块。随后，他又不见了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I am calling you a Muggle," said the voice coolly. "It means that you are not a wizard."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我叫你麻瓜，”那声音冷冷地说，“就是说，你不是个巫师。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don't know what you mean by wizard," said Frank, his voice growing steadier. "All I know is I've heard enough to interest the police tonight, I have. You've done murder and you're planning more! And I'll tell youthis too," he added, on a sudden inspiration, "my wife knows I'm up here, and if I don't come back --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不知道你说的巫师是什么意思。”弗兰克说，他的声音越来越平稳了，“我只知道，今晚我听到的东西足以引起警察的兴趣。你们杀了人，还在策划着要杀更多的人！我还要告诉你们，”他突然灵机一动，说道，“我老伴知道我上这儿来了，如果我不回去——”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You have no wife," said te cold voice, very quietly. "Nobody knows you are here. You told nobody that you were coming. Do not lie to Lord Voldemort, Muggle, for he knows… he always knows…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你没有老伴，”那冰冷的声音慢条斯理地说道，“没有人知道你在这儿。你没有对别人说过你上这儿来了。麻瓜，不要对伏地魔大人说谎，他什么都知道…什么都知道…”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Is that right?" said Frank roughly. "Lord, is it? Well, I don't think much of your manners, My Lord. Turn 'round and face me like a man, why don't you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你说什么？”弗兰克粗暴地说，“大人，是吗？哼，我认为你的风度可不怎么样，我的大人！你为什么不像个男人一样，把脸转过来看着我呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But I am not a man, Muggle," said the cold voice, barely audible now over the crackling of the flames. "I am much, much more than a man. However… why not? I will face you… Wormtail, come turn my chair around."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“因为我不是个人，麻瓜，”那冰冷的嗓音说，声音很低，几乎被炉火的噼啪声盖住了，“我比人厉害得多。不过…好吧！我就面对你一下…虫尾巴，过来把我的椅子转一转。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Slowly, with his face screwed up, as though he would rather have done anything than approach his master and the hearth rug where the snake lay, the small man walked forward and began to turn the chair. The snake lifted its ugly triangular head and hissed slightly as the legs of the chair snagged on its rug.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小个子男人愁眉苦脸，仿佛他最不愿做的事就是走近他的主人，走近那条蛇盘踞的地毯；他慢慢地走上前，开始转动扶手椅。椅腿撞在地毯上时，巨蛇昂起它丑陋的三角形脑袋，发出轻微的嘶嘶声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And then the chair was facing Frank, and he saw what was sitting in it. His walking stick fell to the floor with a clatter. He opened his mouth and let out a scream. He was screaming so loudly that he never heard the words the thing in the chair spoke as it raised a wand. There was a flash of green light, a rushing sound, and Frank Bryce crumpled. He was dead before he hit the floor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在，椅子面对着弗兰克了，他看见了里面坐着的是什么。拐杖啪哒一声掉在地上。他张开嘴，发出一声声凄厉的喊叫。他喊叫的声音太响了，没有听见椅子里那个家伙举起一根棍子时嘴里说了些什么，而且永远也不会听见了。一道绿光闪过，一阵嗖嗖的声音响起，弗兰克·布莱斯瘫倒在地。在倒地之前他就已经死了。">查看中文翻译</div>
