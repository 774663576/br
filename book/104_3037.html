<div class="line_en">I got out of the car and slammed its door. How matter-of-fact, how square that slam sounded in the void of the sunless day! Woof, commented the dog perfunctorily. I pressed the bell button, it vibrated through my whole system. Personne. Je resonne. Repersonne. From what depth this re-nonsense? Woof, said the dog. A rush and a shuffle, and woosh-woof went the door.</div>

The moment, the death I had kept conjuring up for three years was as simple as a bit of dry wood. She was frankly and hugely pregnant. Her head looked smaller (only two seconds had passed really, but let me give them as much wooden duration as life can stand), and her pale-freckled cheeks were hollowed, and her bare shins and arms had lost all their tan, so that the little hairs showed. She wore a brown, sleeveless cotton dress and sloppy felt slippers.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Dick's down there," she said pointing with an invisible tennis racket, inviting my gaze to travel from the drab parlor-bedroom where we stood, right across the kitchen, and through the back-doorway where, in a rather primitive vista, a dark-haired young stranger in overalls, instantaneously reprieved, was perched with his back to me on a ladder fixing something near or upon the shack of his neighbor, a plumper fellow with only one arm, who stood looking up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“狄克在那边”，她说，用一只没有绷网的网球拍指划着，把我的目光从我们站的这个昏暗的客厅兼卧室引向厨房那边，穿过厨房的后门，一直引到一副很原始的远景上去：一个陌生的黑头发年轻人穿着工装裤，立即缓刑，正背对着我站在一架梯子上，把什么东西钉到他邻居家小木屋的旁边或就钉到邻家的屋墙上，那个邻居，是个除酸工，只有一条胳臂，就站在地上往上看着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Come in," she said with a vehement cheerful note. Against the splintery deadwood of the door, Dolly Schiller flattened herself as best she could (even rising on tiptoe a little) to let me pass, and was crucified for a moment, looking down, smiling down at the threshold, hollow-cheeked with round pommettes, her watered-milk-white arms outspread on the wood.

<div class="line_en">Standing in the middle of the slanting room and emitting questioning "hm's," she made familiar Javanese gestures with her wrists and hands, offering me, in a brief display of humorous courtesy, to choose between a rocker and the divan (their bed after ten P. M.). I say "familiar" because one day she had welcomed me with the same wrist dance to her party in Beardsley. We both sat down on the divan. Curious: although actually her looks had faded, I definitely realized, so hopelessly late in the day, how much she looked -- had always looked -- like Botticelli's russet Venus -- the same soft nose, the same blurred beauty. In my pocket my fingers gently let go and repacked a little at the tip, within the handkerchief it was nested in, my unused weapon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她站在这间斜屋中间，用手腕和手打着我熟悉的爪哇人手势，“嗯？”她向我，用幽默且礼貌的简捷表示，让我在摇椅和长沙发之间选择一个。（长沙发晚上十点以后就是他们的床）我说对她的手势很“熟悉”，因为有一天，在比尔兹利，她用的是同一种手腕的舞姿欢迎我参加她的舞会。我们俩都坐在了沙发上。真是奇怪：尽管她红颜已褪，我却明明白白地发现，这发现又实在太晚了，她此时多么象——一直多么象——波提切利笔下那个赤褐色的维纳斯——一样线条柔和的鼻子，一样眩目的美貌。口袋里我的手指轻轻松开了，重又攥紧，手帕里卧着的，是我尚未派上用场的手枪。">查看中文翻译</div>

In her washed-out gray eyes, strangely spectacled, our poor romance was for a moment reflected, pondered upon, and dismissed like a dull party, like a rainy picnic to which only the dullest bores had come, like a humdrum exercise, like a bit of dry mud caking her childhood.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Dick, this is my Dad!" cried Dolly in a resounding violent voice that struck me as totally strange, and new, and cheerful, and old, and sad, because the young fellow, veteran of a remote war, was hard of hearing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“狄克，这是我爸爸！”多丽喊道，声音苍凉而响亮，让我震惊，完全是陌生的，新异的，苍老的，悲哀的，因为那年轻人，是个退伍军人，耳朵很不好使。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Arctic blue eyes, black hair, ruddy cheeks, unshaven chin. We shook hands. Discreet Bill, who evidently took pride in working wonders with one hand, brought in the beer cans he had opened. Wanted to withdraw. The exquisite courtesy of simple folks. Was made to stay. A beer ad. In point of fact, I preferred it that way, and so did the Schillers. I switched to the jittery rocker. Avidly munching, Dolly plied me with marshmallows and potato chips. The men looked at her fragile, frileux, diminutive, old-world, youngish but sickly, father in velvet coat and beige vest, maybe a viscount.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="清亮的蓝眼睛，黑黑的头发，红润的面颊，没刮胡子的下巴。我们握手。深思熟虑的比尔，显然很以能用一只手臂创造奇迹为骄傲，把他开好了的啤酒全拿了进来。他想退出。这是单纯的人们很得体的礼貌。劝君留住。一条啤酒广告。事实上，我愿意他在这儿，希勒夫妇也同样。我坐到颤微微的摇椅上。多丽不断递给我果汁软搪和土豆片，她自己也起劲地嚼着。两个男人都看着她那穿天鹅绒外套、薄斜纹呢背心，虚弱、怕冷、瘦小、老派、年纪不老却病恹恹、可能是个子爵的父亲。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They were under the impression I had come to stay, and Dick with a great wrinkling of brows that denoted difficult thought, suggested Dolly and he might sleep in the kitchen on a spare mattress. I waved a light hand and told Dolly who transmitted it by means of a special shout to Dick that I had merely dropped in on my way to Readsburg where I was to be entertained by some friends and admirers. It was then noticed that one of the few thumbs remaining to Bill was bleeding (not such a wonder-worker after all). How womanish and somehow never seen that way before was the shadowy divison between her pale breasts when she bent down over the man's hand! She took him for repairs to the kitchen. For a few minutes, three or four little eternities which positively welled with artificial warmth, Dick and I remained alone. He sat on a hard chair rubbing his fore-limbs and frowning. I had an idle urge to squeeze out the blackheads on the wings of his perspiring nose with my long agate claws. He had nice sad eyes with beautiful lashes, and very white teeth. His Adam's apple was large and hairy. Why don't they shave better, those young brawny chaps? He and his Dolly had had unrestrained intercourse on that couch there, at least a hundred and eighty times, probably much more; and before that -- how long had she known him? No grudge. Funny -- no grudge at all, nothing except grief and nausea. He was now rubbing his nose. I was sure that when finally he would open his mouth, he would say (slightly shaking his head): "Aw, she's a swell kid, Mr. Haze. She sure is. And she's going to make a swell mother." He opened his mouth -- and took a sip of beer. This gave him countenance -- and he went on sipping till he frothed at the mouth. He was a lamb. He had cupped her Florentine breasts. His fingernails were black and broken, but the phalanges, the whole carpus, the strong shapely wrist were far, far finer than mine: I have hurt too much too many bodies with my twisted poor hands to be proud of them. French epithets, a Dorset yokel's knuckles, an Austrian tailor's flat finger tips -- that's Humbert Humbert.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们以为我是来住下的，狄克紧锁双眉，显出他的思索颇费周折，而后建议他和多丽睡到厨房里一张备用的床垫上面。我轻轻摆摆手，告诉多丽，多丽又特别大声地嚷给狄克说，我是去雷兹伯格，顺路来看看，那儿会有一些朋友和崇拜者好好款待我的。这时，我们发现，比尔仅剩的几个手指中的一个在流血（毕竟不是个创造奇迹的人）。她弯下身子去看他的手，两个乳房间那条幽暗的小沟女人味十足，那样子我从没见过！她把比尔带到厨房去包扎。有几分钟，只剩了我和狄克。他坐在一张硬椅上，抓挠着两条胳膊，皱着双眉。我有种无聊的冲动，想用我坚硬的长爪子把他汗津津的鼻翼上的粉刺挤掉，他有双漂亮而忧郁的眼睛，美丽的睫毛，雪白的牙齿。喉结很突出，毛茸茸的。他们为什么不好好刮一下呢？这个强壮的小伙子？他和他的多丽在那长沙发上放纵交欢至少也有一百八十次了吧，很可能还要多；在此之前，她认识他究竟有多久？没有妒嫉，真是奇怪——一点也不妒嫉，只是觉得难受、恶心。他这会儿开始挠他的鼻子。我肯定，他最后开口时，会说（轻轻地晃一下脑袋）：“呵，她是个了不起的孩子，黑兹先生。她真的是，她就要作一个了不起的母亲啦。”他张开了嘴巴——呷了一口啤酒。这使他镇定了些——他又继续喝，直到嘴角泛出泡沫。他是只绵羊羔子。他抚摸过她佛罗伦萨人的乳房。他的指甲黑乎乎，参差不齐，而那指骨，整个手腕，以及粗大的腕关节，却比我的强健得多：我这双可怜的扭曲的手，伤害过太多太多的肉体，我无法为它们感到骄傲。法国式称号，多塞特乡下佬式指关节，奥地利裁缝式扁平指尖——这就是亨伯特。亨伯特。">查看中文翻译</div>

The wooden floor slanted, a little steel ball would have rolled into the kitchen. I knew all I wanted to know. I had no intention of torturing my darling. Somewhere beyond Bill's shack an afterwork radio had begun singing of folly and fate, and there she was with her ruined looks and her adult, rope-veined narrow hands and her goose-flesh white arms, and her shallow ears, and her unkempt armpits, there she was (my Lolita!), hopelessly worn at seventeen, with that baby, dreaming already in her of becoming a big shot and retiring around 2020 A. D.-- and I looked and looked at her, and knew as clearly as I know I am to die, that I loved her more than anything I had ever seen or imagined on earth, or hoped for anywhere else. She was only the faint violet whiff and dead leaf echo of the nymphet I had rolled myself upon with such cries in the past; an echo on the brink of a russet ravine, with a far wood under a white sky, and brown leaves choking the brook, and one last cricket in the crisp weeds… but thank God it was not that echo alone that I worshiped. What I used to pamper among the tangled vines of my heart, mon grand pêché radieux, had dwindled to its essence: sterile and selfish vice, all that I canceled and cursed. You may jeer at me, and threaten to clear the court, but until I am gagged and half-throttled, I will shout my poor truth. I insist the world know how much I loved my Lolita, this Lolita, pale and polluted, and big with another's child, but still gray-eyed, still sooty-lashed, still auburn and almond, still Carmencita, still mine; Changeons de vie, ma Carmen, allons vivre quelque part où nous ne serons jamais séparés; Ohio? The wilds of Massachusetts? No matter, even if those eyes of hers would fade to myopic fish, and her nipples swell and crack, and her lovely young velvety delicate delta be tainted and torn -- even then I would go mad with tenderness at the mere sight of your dear wan face, at the mere sound of your raucous young voice, my Lolita.</div>

I almost said -- trying to find some casual remark --"I wonder sometimes what has become of the little McCoo girl, did she ever get better?"-- but stopped in time lest she rejoin: "I wonder sometimes what has become of the little Haze girl…" Finally, I reverted to money matters. That sum, I said, represented more or less the net rent from her mother's house; she said: "Had it not been sold years ago?" No (I admit I had told her this in order to sever all connections with R.); a lawyer would send a full account of the financial situation later; it was rosy; some of the small securities her mother had owned had gone up and up.

<div class="line_en">Carmencita, lui demandais-je…"One last word," I said in my horrible careful English, "are you quite, quite sure that -- well, not tomorrow, of course, and not after tomorrow, but -- well -- some day, any day, you will not come to live with me? I will create a brand new God and thank him with piercing cries, if you give me that microscopic hope" (to that effect).</div>

<div class="line_en">She and the dog saw me off. I was surprised (this a rhetorical figure, I was not) that the sight of the old car in which she had ridden as a child and a nymphet, left her so very indifferent. All she remarked was it was getting sort of purplish about the gills. I said it was hers, I could go by bus. She said don't be silly, they would fly to Jupiter and buy a car there. I said I would buy this one from her for five hundred dollars.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她和那条狗给我送行。我很惊奇（这是个夸张的修辞手段，我其实并不如此），那辆在她是孩子时、是性感少女时，曾带她兜过风的旧车，这会儿就那么冷漠地驶出了她的视线。她只说它越来越浅，象紫色的了。我说那是她的，我可以乘公共汽车。她说我犯傻，他们将飞往朱庇特到那儿再买一辆。我说，那么我就花五百元把她这辆买下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
