<div class="line_en">In the last few weeks, he had come to realize (half sadly, half laughing to himself) that he had grown physically tired (he had one, sometimes two erotic engagements a day), and that although he had not lost his zest for women, he found himself straining his forces to the utmost. (Let me add that the strain was on his physical, not his sexual powers; his problem was with his breath, not with his penis, a state of affairs that had its comical side.)</div>

<div class="line_en">One of Jules Verne's famous novels, a favorite of Tomas's in his childhood, is called Two Years on Holiday, and indeed two years is the maximum. Tomas was in his third year as a window washer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当托马斯还是个孩子的时候，他很喜欢儒勒·凡尔纳的一本很有名的小说，叫做《两年假期》。的确，两年是假期的极限。而他都快擦了三年的玻璃了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One day he was having trouble reaching a prospect for his afternoon time slot, and it looked as though he was going to have one of his rare off days. He was desperate. He had phoned a certain young woman about ten times. A charming acting student whose body had been tanned on Yugoslavia's nudist beaches with an evenness that called to mind slow rotation on a mechanized spit.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天，他想给下午安排一个幽会，但像有时会发生的那样，没有一个女朋友给他回电话，这个下午有可能要独自一人度过了。他对此深为失望。于是，他打了十来个电话给一个年轻姑娘，一个很迷人的学戏剧艺术的女大学生，南斯拉夫某处裸体海滩的日光浴，给她的皮肤镀上了引以为傲的褐色，颜色均匀得就好像她被串在铁扦上，在精密的机动烧烤装置上慢慢地旋转烤过。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After making one last call from his final job of the day and starting back to the office at four to hand in his signed order slips, he was stopped in the center of Prague by a woman he failed to recognize. Wherever have you disappeared to? I haven't seen you in ages!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每到一个商场干活，他都给她打一个电话，但纯属徒劳。快四点的时候，他刚干完了一圈活儿要回办公室交回签过的工单，忽然听到一个陌生女人在布拉格市中心的一条街上喊他。她朝他笑着说：“大夫，您都藏到哪里去了？我连您的影子都看不到了！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tomas racked his brains to place her. Had she been one of his patients? She was behaving like an intimate friend. He tried to answer in a manner that would conceal the fact that he did not recognize her. He was already thinking about how to lure her to his friend's flat (he had the key in his pocket) when he realized from a chance remark who the woman was: the budding actress with the perfect tan, the one he had been trying to reach all day.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="托马斯竭力回想在哪儿跟她见过面。是他以前的一个病人吗？看她的样子，好像他们曾是很亲密的朋友。他支吾着跟她搭话，不让她看出他没有认出她来。可脑子里已经开始打主意，怎么才能说服她陪他到朋友的寓所去，房子的钥匙可一直都在他口袋里。突然，对方的一句话让他终于想起了这个女人是谁：就是那个有着出众的褐色皮肤、学戏剧艺术的女大学生，那个他找了一整天的女人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This episode both amused and horrified him: it proved that he was as tired mentally as physically. Two years of holiday could not be extended indefinitely.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这件不如意的事让他觉得有趣也让他害怕：他累了，不仅仅是身体上，也是精神上；两年的假期，不能再无限延长了。">查看中文翻译</div>
