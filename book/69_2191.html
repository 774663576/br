<div class="line_en">He explained his idea to Lyra and Farder Coram the next day, when Lyra's seasickness had abated slightly. The sun was shining brightly and the green waves were dashing against the bows, bearing white streams of foam as they curved away. Out on the deck, with the breeze blowing and the whole sea a-sparkle with light and movement, she felt little sickness at all; and now that Pantalaimon had discovered the delights of being a seagull and then a stormy petrel and skimming the wave tops, Lyra was too absorbed by his glee to wallow in landlubberly misery.</div>

<div class="line_en">"No, you're wrong, Adam," said Farder Coram. "He weren't there at all. The witches have the power to separate their-selves from their daemons a mighty sight further'n what we can. If need be, they can send their daemons far abroad on the wind or the clouds, or down below the ocean. And this witch I found, she hadn't been resting above an hour when her daemon came a flying back, because he'd felt her fear and her injury, of course. And it's my belief, though she never admitted to this, that the great red bird I shot was another witch's daemon, in pursuit. Lord! That made me shiver, when I thought of that. I'd have stayed my hand; I'd have taken any measures on sea or land; but there it was. Anyway, there was no doubt I'd saved her life, and she gave me a token of it, and said I was to call on her help if ever it was needed. And once she sent me help when the Skraelings shot me with a poison arrow. We had other connections, too… I haven't seen her from that day to this, but she'll remember."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，你错了，亚当，”法德尔·科拉姆说，“他根本就不在场。女巫有能力把自己跟精灵分开，距离要比我们所能做到的远多了。如果有必要，她们能让她们的精灵乘风驾云，去很远的地方，还能让他们下到大洋深处。至于我发现的这个女巫，她刚刚休息了不到一个小时的光景，她的精灵就飞了回来，当然是因为他已经感应到了她的恐惧，感应到她已经受了伤。而且，虽然她从来没有承认过，但我觉得，我射落的那只红色的大鸟是另一个女巫的精灵，正在追杀她。天啊！一想到这个，我就禁不住发抖。否则，我是绝对不会射那只鸟的，我会采用其他任何海上的、陆路的办法；但是，那只鸟已经被我射下来了。不管怎么说，我救了她的命，这一点毫无疑问；她送给我一个信物，并且说，要是有必要，我可以向她求助。有一次，我被斯克雷林丑人的一枝毒箭射中了，她帮了我的忙。我们还有其他方面的联系…从那天起一直到现在，我再也没见过她，但她会记得我的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"At least," Farder Coram said, "that's what it seemed. Being as she'd fell out of the air, I more than suspected she was a witch. She looked exactly like a young woman, thinner than some and prettier than most, but not seeing that daemon gave me a hideous turn."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“至少看上去就是这样，”法德尔·科拉姆说，“因为她是从天上掉下来的，所以我几乎可以肯定她一定是个女巫。看上去她跟普通的年轻女人完全一样，比一般人瘦，比大部分人漂亮，但没看见她的精灵却让我感到厌恶。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Lyra was keen to know more about the witches, but the men had turned their talk to the matter of fuel and stores, and presently she grew impatient to see the rest of the ship. She wandered along the deck toward the bows, and soon made the acquaintance of an able seaman by flicking at him the pips she'd saved from the apple she'd eaten at breakfast. He was a stout and placid man, and when he'd sworn at her and been sworn at in return, they became great friends. He was called Jerry. Under his guidance she found out that having something to do prevented you from feeling seasick, and that even a job like scrubbing a deck could be satisfying, if it was done in a seamanlike way. She was very taken with this notion, and later on she folded the blankets on her bunk in a seamanlike way, and put her possessions in the closet in a seamanlike way, and used "stow" instead of "tidy" for the process of doing so.</div>

<div class="line_en">All the time they were steaming north, and it grew colder daily. The ship's stores were searched for oilskins that could be cut down for her, and Jerry showed her how to sew, an art she learned willingly from him, though she had scorned it at Jordan and avoided instruction from Mrs. Lonsdale. Together they made a waterproof bag for the alethiometer that she could wear around her waist, in case she fell in the sea, she said. With it safely in place she clung to the rail in her oilskins and sou'wester as the stinging spray broke over the bows and surged along the deck. She still felt seasick occasionally, especially when the wind got up and the ship plunged heavily over the crests of the gray-green waves, and then it was Pantalaimon's job to distract her from it by skimming the waves as a stormy petrel; because she could feel his boundless glee in the dash of wind and water, and forget her nausea. From time to time he even tried being a fish, and once joined a school of dolphins, to their surprise and pleasure. Lyra stood shivering in the fo'c'sle and laughed with delight as her beloved Pantalaimon, sleek and powerful, leaped from the water with half a dozen other swift gray shapes. He had to stay close to the ship, of course, for he could never go far from her; but she sensed his desire to speed as far and as fast as he could, for pure exhilaration. She shared his pleasure, but for her it wasn't simple pleasure, for there was pain and fear in it too. Suppose he loved being a dolphin more than he loved being with her on land? What would she do then?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们一直向北行驶，天气一天比一天冷。他们在储藏室里找了几块油布，帮她剪下来，杰里教她怎样把它们缝在一起。虽然在乔丹学院的时候，她对此不屑一顾，朗斯代尔太太教她的时候，她还躲起来，但她却很愿意跟杰里学这门手艺。他们一起给真理仪做了个防水袋子——她说，她可以把这个袋子绑在腰上，以防万一自己掉到水里。真理仪万无一失之后，她便穿着油布衣服，戴着防水帽，把身子靠在栏杆上，看着溅起的浪花越过船头，冲到甲板上。偶尔她还有晕船的感觉，尤其是起风的时候，船便从灰绿色的浪尖重重地跌下去。这时，潘特莱蒙的任务是变成一只海燕，不断地掠过浪尖，把她的注意力引开，因为她能体会到他搏击风浪时的无限乐趣，也就会忘记恶心。潘特莱蒙还时不时地变成一条鱼，有一次还加入到一群海豚中间，让它们既惊讶又高兴。莱拉哆哩哆嗦地站在前甲板上，兴奋地大声笑着，看着她心爱的潘特莱蒙圆滑、有力的身子，跟其它六只灰色的海豚一起，迅速地从水中跃起。当然，潘特莱蒙只能待在船的附近，因为他和莱拉之间永远也不能离得太远；但是，莱拉感觉到，他高兴得很想以最快的速度游到最远的地方去。她分享着他的快乐，但是对莱拉来说，她感到的并非只是单纯的快乐，因为其中还有痛苦和恐惧。假如潘特莱蒙更喜欢做海豚、而不愿在陆地上跟着她了呢？那她该怎么办？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After two days at sea, Lyra decided that this was the life for her. She had the run of the ship, from the engine room to the bridge, and she was soon on first-name terms with all the crew. Captain Rokeby let her signal to a Hollands frigate by pulling the handle of the steam whistle; the cook suffered her help in mixing plum duff; and only a stern word from John Faa prevented her from climbing the foremast to inspect the horizon from the crow's nest.</div>

Lyra was on deck a minute after she woke up, gazing greedily at the land: such a strange sight, after all that water, for though they had only been at sea a few days, Lyra felt as if they'd been on the ocean for months. Directly ahead of the ship a mountain rose, green flanked and snow-capped, and a little town and harbor lay below it: wooden houses with steep roofs, an oratory spire, cranes in the harbor, and clouds of gulls wheeling and crying. The smell was of fish, but mixed with it came land smells too: pine resin and earth and something animal and musky, and something else that was cold and blank and wild: it might have been snow. It was the smell of the North.</div>

<div class="line_en">Seals frisked around the ship, showing their clown faces above the water before sinking back without a splash. The wind that lifted spray off the white-capped waves was monstrously cold, and searched out every gap in Lyra's wolfskin, and her hands were soon aching and her face numb. Pantalaimon, in his ermine shape, warmed her neck for her, but it was too cold to stay outside for long without work to do, even to watch the seals, and Lyra went below to eat her breakfast porridge and look through the porthole in the saloon.</div>

<div class="line_en">A servant showed them into a little parlor and brought them Coffee. Presently the consul himself came in to greet them. He was a fat man with a florid face and a sober black suit, whose name was Martin Lanselius. His dsmon was a little serpent, the same intense and brilliant green as his eyes, which were the only witchlike thing about him, though Lyra was not sure what she had been expecting a witch to look like.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个仆人把他们领到一间小会客室，给他们端上咖啡。很快，领事就亲自出来欢迎他们了。他长得很胖，面色红润，穿着一件合体的黑色西装。他叫马丁·兰斯刘斯，他的精灵是一条小毒蛇，跟他的眼睛一样，显得炽热，闪着明亮的绿光。他的眼睛是他身上惟一像巫师的地方，尽管莱拉也拿不准自己期待的女巫会是什么样子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The first thing she and Farder Coram did ashore was to visit the house of the witch consul. It didn't take long to find it; the little town was clustered around the harbor, with the oratory and the governor's house the only buildings of any size. The witch consul lived in a green-painted wooden house within sight of the sea, and when they rang the bell it jangled loudly in the quiet street.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="上岸后，她和法德尔·科拉姆做的第一件事就是去女巫的领事那儿。他们没花多长时间就找到了那座房子；小镇就建在港湾周围，教堂和镇长的房子是镇上惟一规模较大的建筑。女巫的领事住在一座漆成了绿色的木头房子里，看得见大海。他们按响门铃的时候，整个寂静的街道便响起了刺耳的铃声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That wasn't hard. Lyra turned the hands to the camel, which meant Asia, which meant Tartars; to the cornucopia, for Kamchatka, where there were gold mines; and to the ant, which meant activity, which meant purpose and intention. Then she sat still, letting her mind hold the three levels of meaning together in focus, and relaxed for the answer, which came almost at once.

<div class="line_cn" title="这并不难。莱拉把指针拨到骆驼、羊角和蚂蚁那儿——骆驼代表的是亚洲，也就是指鞑靼人；羊角①代表的是勘察加半岛，因为那里有金矿；蚂蚁代表的是活动，也就是指目的和意图。然后，莱拉便静静地坐下来，在脑子里清晰地盯着这三层意思，全身放松，等待着答案。真理仪几乎马上就给出了答案。那根长指针在海豚、头盔和婴儿那里抖动起来，在它们之间不断地摆动，然后又指向了坩埚。它摆动的路线非常复杂，但莱拉的眼睛还是毫不费力地跟上了它的节奏，可是在场的两位男士却无法理解。【注：①在希腊神话中，羊角指的是给宙斯哺乳的山羊的角。后来，羊角从山羊身上脱落下来，里面盛满了各种水果。后来，在西方文化中，尤其是在绘画和雕刻中，羊角便被用来象征丰收、富饶、繁荣。】">查看中文翻译</div>

"I know it's the fifteenth because it stopped fifteen times and it just got clear at that level but nowhere else. And the helmet means war, and both together they mean pretend to go to war but not be serious. And the baby means -- it means difficult -- it'd be too hard for them to attack it, and the anchor says why, because they'd be stretched out as tight as an anchor rope. I just see it all like that, you see."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“海豚最深层的意思中有一个是玩耍，有点儿顽皮的意思，”莱拉解释道，“我知道这里指的是它的第十五层意思，因为指针在那儿停了十五次，而且只有停在这一层上，而不是在其他层次上，它的意思才清晰起来。头盔的意思是战争，跟海豚放在一起，它们的意思就是假装打仗，不是真打。婴儿的意思是——它代表的是困难——也就是说，鞑靼人很难发动进攻。这个锚解释的是原因，因为他们会像锚索那样被拽得紧紧的。你看，我就是这么看出来的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Fighting, in all probability," said Farder Coram. "We're moving north until we find a place where they've taken some children captive. When we find it, we'll have to fight to get the children free; and then we'll bring them back."</div>

<div class="line_en">Lyra felt her skin shiver all over. She would have thought a question like that, which was almost an insult, would enrage the great creature beyond reason, and she wondered at Farder Coram's courage in asking it. lorek Byrnison put down his jar and came close to the gate to peer at the old man's face. Farder Coram didn't flinch.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱拉觉得自己全身都颤抖了一下。她自己也会想到这个问题，但这个问题近乎是一种侮辱，会激怒这个大家伙，会让他失去理性。法德尔·科拉姆居然问了这个问题，他的勇气真让她感到惊讶。埃欧雷克·伯尔尼松放下罐子，走到离门很近的地方，盯着老人的脸看。但法德尔·科拉姆没有畏缩。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I know the people you are seeking, the child cutters," the bear said. "They left town the day before yesterday to go north with more children. No one will tell you about them; they pretend not to see, because the child cutters bring money and Business. Now, I don't like the child cutters, so I shall answer you politely. I stay here and drink spirits because the men here took my armor away, and without that, I can hunt seals but I can't go to war; and I am an armored bear; war is the sea I swim in and the air I breathe. The men of this town gave me spirits and let me drink till I was asleep, and then they took my armor away from me. If I knew where they keep it, I would tear down the town to get it back. If you want my service, the price is this: get me back my armor. Do that, and I shall serve you in your campaign, either until I am dead or until you have a victory. The price is my armor. I want it back, and then I shall never need spirits again."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我认识你要找的那些人，就是那些抢劫小孩儿的人，”熊说，“他们前天又带了些小孩儿往北去了。谁也不会告诉你有关他们的情况，他们假装没看见，因为抢劫小孩儿的人给他们带来了钱和生意。可我不喜欢那些抢小孩儿的人，所以我就客气地回答你的问题。我留在这儿喝酒，是因为这儿的人把我的盔甲拿走了；没有盔甲，我可以捕海豹，却不能打仗；而我是披甲熊，打仗对我来说就是游泳时的大海、呼吸时的空气。当初，这个镇上的人给我酒喝，一直把我灌到睡着了为止，然后他们就把我的盔甲拿走了。我要是知道他们把它藏在哪儿，就算把整个镇子弄他个天翻地覆，我也要把盔甲找回来。你要是让我为你效力，那么你要付的报酬就是：把我的盔甲找回来。你做到了，我就一直替你打仗，直到我战死或者你取得胜利。报酬就是我的盔甲。我要把它找回来，有了它，我就再也不必喝酒了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
