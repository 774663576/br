<div class="line_en">During the last half mile, Dylan thought she could hear distant howling, although it was difficult to tell over the wind. However, Tristan had increased the pace once again, grabbing her hand to urge her to speed up, confirming her suspicions that danger lurked nearby.</div>

<div class="line_en">As soon as they entered the confines of the cottage, he instantly relaxed. The muscles in his jaw, clenched tight in concern, loosened into a slow smile, and his eyebrows unfurrowed, smoothing out the creases in his forehead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们刚一进入小屋，他马上就放松了。刚才出于担心下颌部紧绷的肌肉也松弛了下来，天然带着几分笑意。他松开了紧锁的眉头，额头上的抬头纹也平复了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This cottage was very much like the other places they had stayed in over the past two nights: pieces of broken furniture strewn about a single large room. There were two windows on either side of the front door, and two more at the rear of the cottage. They were made up of small panes of glass, and several in each window were broken, allowing the wind to whistle noisily through the room. Tristan snatched some scraps of material from beside the bed and began to stuff the small holes, while Dylan crossed to a chair and flopped down, exhausted from the day's exertion. Although, if she didn't need sleep, should she really be tired? Whatever, she thought. Her muscles hurt; or felt like they did. Trying to put her muddled thoughts out of her mind, she watched Tristan work.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小屋跟之前两个晚上他们待过的那些地方非常像：一间大屋，破烂的家具横七竖八地堆在地上。前门两侧各有一扇窗，后面也有两扇窗。窗子由小玻璃窗格构成，每一扇窗户上都有几面窗格已经破损，风呼啸着顺着破洞钻进屋里。崔斯坦从床边抓起一些碎料，开始修补这些小洞。而迪伦则走到椅子边，颓然坐下。走了一天的路她已经精疲力竭了。但是，如果她不需要睡觉，那她真的会感觉疲惫吗？管他呢，她想。她的肌肉很痛，但也许只是她觉得它们应该在痛。她把这些胡思乱想尽力抛到脑后，只盯着忙碌的崔斯坦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That night they stayed in another cottage, another safe house on the route across the wasteland. The afternoon had passed quickly, marching at a pace that had Dylan guessing that Tristan was trying to make up for time lost during their argument. They reached the cottage just before the sun disappeared over the horizon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那晚他们住进了另一座小木屋，穿越荒原途中的又一间庇护所。下午过得很快，他们行进的速度让迪伦觉得崔斯坦是在尽力弥补因为吵架浪费的时间，他们在太阳消失在地平线之前就走到了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tristan turned and gave her a very small, forced smile. Dylan grimaced back, lost as to how to pull him out of his black mood. She watched as he stood lithely and crossed the room, plonking himself down on the opposite side of the small table that she had leaned her elbows on. He copied her position so that they were face to face, just a half-metre apart. They stared at each other for a short moment. Tristan's mouth twisted to the side as he read the slight awkwardness in her eyes, and with some effort he offered her a genuine smile. Dylan took courage from the gesture.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="崔斯坦转过头，对着她勉强地笑了笑。迪伦回敬了一个鬼脸，一门心思想让他摆脱郁闷的心情。她看着他敏捷地站起来，穿过屋子，然后一屁股坐在她刚才支着胳膊的那张小桌子对面。他也照搬了迪伦的姿势，于是两人隔着半米，就这样四目相对。他们互相看了对方一会儿。崔斯坦看出迪伦眼中的尴尬，嘴动了动，费了点劲，终于给了她一个真正的微笑。迪伦从中找到了一些勇气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Once he had finished with the windows, Tristan busied himself building a fire. He took much longer than the previous night, fiddling with the lie of the logs and snapping twigs into a perfect pyramid. Even when the fire was crackling merrily away, he still didn't move from the fireplace, but stood crouched over it, staring into the flames as though mesmerised. Dylan began to feel sure that he was avoiding her, a feat that was next to impossible in the small room. She decided to try a stab at humour to bring him out of his reverie.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="忙完了补窗户的活后，崔斯坦又开始张罗着生火。他花的时间要比昨天晚上更长，把那堆木头摆弄来摆弄去，又把树枝折断码成一座标准的金字塔形。哪怕火已经噼噼啪啪地发出了欢乐的响声，他还是在壁炉前蹲着没动，好像被催眠了一般，呆呆地对着火苗出神。迪伦终于明白了，他这是在躲着自己。在这个有限的空间里，他这样的小伎俩几乎是行不通的。她决定试着说几句俏皮话，把他从沉思中拉回来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"If this place is my making, why are all these cottages so crappy? Couldn't my imagination come up with a slightly better resting spot? Maybe something with a Jacuzzi, or a telly?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Tristan saw the regret, guilt and -- worst of all -- pity in her eyes and felt a confusing mixture of emotions. On the one hand, there was a kind of perverse pleasure that she cared enough about his pain to feel sorry for him, but also a niggling frustration that she was making him think about things that he'd long since accepted and come to terms with. For the first time in a long while he felt aggrieved at his lot in life. At the never-ending circular prison his existence amounted to. All of those selfish souls who had lied, cheated, wasted the life they had been given; a gift he could never have and longed for.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="崔斯坦在她的眼中看到了后悔、内疚—最糟糕的是—还有同情。他心里不禁五味杂陈。一方面，他看到她关心自己的痛苦，为自己感到难过，心里有种莫名的快乐；但同时一股沮丧的心绪也在不断烦扰着他。她让他又重新想起了那些他早就无可奈何地接受的事情。很久以来他第一次为自己的命运黯然神伤。他的生活简直就是一座监狱，永无止境地轮回。他看到那些自私的灵魂说谎、欺骗、浪费上天赐予他们的生命，而这却是他梦寐以求又求之不得的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"At first, I didn't really think about it. I had a job, and I did it. It seemed the most important thing in the world to protect each soul, to keep it safe.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“开始我真没想过这个问题。这是我的工作，我做就是了。保护每个灵魂，让他们平安无恙，似乎这就是天底下最重要的事情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tristan stared at her, astonished by the question. Nobody, not one soul of all the thousands he'd guided over, had ever asked him that. And what answer to give? The truth was hard, but he didn't want to lie to her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="崔斯坦看着她，心里暗暗吃惊。他曾经护送过成千上万的灵魂，但他们中间没有一个问过这种问题。怎么回答呢？事实让人难以接受，但他不想对她说谎。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It took a long time before I started to see some of the people for what they really were. Who they really were. I stopped pitying them; stopped being kind. They didn't deserve it." Tristan's voice twisted as bitterness coated his tongue. He breathed in deeply, pushing the resentment back down, glossing over it with the facade of indifference that he'd perfected over time. "They cross over, and I have to watch them walk away. That's how it is."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过了很长时间，我才开始看清一些人的真面目。我不再对他们同情怜悯，我不再对他们和颜悦色，因为他们不配。”崔斯坦嘴里满是苦涩，声音也变了调。他深吸一口气，把心中的怨恨压下去，用外表的冷漠遮掩。经过这么长时间，他已经把这张冷脸修炼到家了，“他们穿过去，我必须看着他们走远。就是这么回事。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It had been like that for a long time now. Then this one had come along, and she was so different that it was knocking him out of the role that he usually played. He'd been fairly horrible to her -- sneering, patronising, making fun of her -- but he couldn't help it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="很久以来一直都是如此。然后这个人来了，她跟其他人完全不同，这也让他从长期以来扮演的角色中走了出来。他一直对她凶巴巴的—冷嘲热讽、盛气凌人、捉弄取笑—但他不得不这样做。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She had him off-balance, off-kilter somehow. She was no angel, he knew that, saw it in the million different memories of hers that played in his head, but there was something unusual -- no, special -- about her. He felt guilt stir in the pit of his stomach as she squirmed uncomfortably in the chair, compassion and borrowed sorrow etched across her face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她让他有种头重脚轻失去平衡的感觉。他不是天使，他清楚这一点。她往昔的无数记忆都在他头脑中过了一遍。但是，他身上有种不寻常—不，应该是很独特的气质。当她坐在椅子上局促不安，为他的不幸脸上满是同情与哀伤之色的时候，他心窝里会生出一股内疚之情。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“圣诞老人。”他说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He shrugged. "It was a little kid. He died on Christmas Eve in a car crash. He was only about five, and Santa was the person he trusted more than anyone. He'd sat on his knee in a store a couple of days before, and it was one of his favourite memories." A humorous light sparkled in his eyes. "I had to keep jiggling my belly and shouting, 'Ho! Ho! Ho!' to keep him happy. He was very disappointed when he found out Santa couldn't sing 'Jingle Bells' in tune."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他耸耸肩，“那是个小孩子。他在平安夜死于一场车祸，他只有五岁，他最信任的人就是圣诞老人。车祸前的十几天，他还坐在商店里圣诞老人的膝盖上，那是他最美好的记忆了。”他眼中闪出一丝幽默的光芒，“我只好轻轻摇着肚子，喊着‘嗬、嗬、嗬’，哄他开心。后来他发现圣诞老人唱《铃儿响叮当》都不在调上，这让他很失望。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a very long time ago, but in his mind's eye Tristan could still see every detail. His first memory of existing was walking, walking in a landscape of brilliant white. There had been no floors, no walls, no sky. The fact that he was walking was the only evidence that any surface existed at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那是很久以前的事了，但在崔斯坦心中，当时的所有细节都历历在目。他最初的记忆是自己行走在一片炫目的白光中，没有地板，没有墙壁，没有天空。他在行走，这是地面存在的唯一证据。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你知道对我来说最诡异的事是什么吗？”她问。他摇摇头，她接着说，“就是看着你，心里想着你我同龄，但脑海深处却知道你其实是个成年人。不，你比成年人岁数还大，比任何我认识的人岁数都要大。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then out of nowhere details had begun to appear. The ground beneath his feet was suddenly a dirt track. Hedges sprang up on either side of him, high and unruly and rustling with the sounds of living creatures. It was night, the sky above him was inky black interspersed with twinkling stars. He recognised and could name all of these things. He also knew where he was going, and why he was there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后各种具体的景物突然就出现了—脚下的地面一下子成了一条土路，高大而杂乱的篱笆从他两侧拔地而起，虫鸣其间，沙沙作响。入夜时分，头顶漆黑的天空中还有几颗寒星闪烁其间。他能清楚辨认这一切，喊得出它们的名字。他也知道自己从哪里来、为什么在那儿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There was a fire," he said. "A thick plume of smoke was winding its way up into the sky, and that was where I was headed. I was walking up a lane, then from out of nowhere two men came flying past me. They ran so close to me that I could feel the air stirring, but they couldn't see me. When I got to the source of the flames, I saw that the two men were trying to draw water from a well, but their efforts were in vain. They could not defeat a fire like that. It was a vicious inferno. A man could not hope to survive such a thing. That was why I was there, of course."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那里有火光，”他说，“浓烟滚滚，蜿蜒曲折窜入云霄。我就朝那个方向走去，我沿着一条巷子走，不知从哪里冒出两个人从我身边飞奔而过。他们离我很近，我能感到空气在流动，但是他们看不到我。当我终于走到火光的源头时，我看到那两个人正在努力从一口井里汲水，但他们的努力全都白费了，他们根本就扑不灭熊熊烈火。根本没人能从那样的大火中逃生，当然，我也是因为这个才到那里去的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"'I'm dead, aren't I?' he said. I just nodded, not trusting myself to speak.</div>

<div class="line_en">"The hardest part. I waited as Gregor watched her outburst with an agonised look burned across his features. One arm was stretched out towards her, but he seemed to realise that he could not offer comfort, and he had remained next to me. After a few seconds, he turned and spoke.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“接下来是最困难的部分。她哭得死去活来，满脸痛苦的表情。格雷戈尔望着她，朝她伸出了一只手臂，但似乎很快又发觉自己再也无法安慰她了。他一直站在我身旁没有动，过了几秒钟，他转身对我说话。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"'Do I have to go with you?' he asked, looking wistfully towards the crying woman.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我必须要跟你走吗？”他问道。他无限伤感地看着那个哭泣的女人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"'Where are we going?' he enquired, still gazing at the woman who simply stared, mesmerised and horrified, at the burning building.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们要去哪里呢？”他询问道，目光还停在她身上。女人只是痴痴地盯着正在燃烧的房子，脸上还带着惊骇的表情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"'Yes,' I replied.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的。”我回答。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I panicked when he asked me that," Tristan confessed. "I didn't know what to say."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他问起这个的时候我心里也发慌，”崔斯坦向迪伦坦白道，“我不知该说些什么。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I said 'I am just the ferryman. I do not determine that.'</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“那你是怎么告诉他的？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Thankfully the man accepted this answer and I turned and begun walking away into the dark night. With one last look at the woman, Gregor followed."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“谢天谢地，他还是接受了这个解释。我转过身，走进了茫茫黑夜。格雷戈尔看了女人最后一眼，然后跟在了后面。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Poor woman," Dylan muttered, thinking of the wife, left behind and left alone. "That man, Gregor, he knew he was dead. Right away he knew." She looked incredulous.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可怜的女人。”迪伦一边喃喃自语，一边还在为那个突然被撇下，自此孤身一个人的妻子惋惜，“那个男的，格雷戈尔，他知道自己已经死了，他马上就知道了？”她一副难以置信的眼神。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well," replied Tristan, "he had just walked through the wall of a burning building. Besides, back then, people where you're from were much more religious. They didn't question their church and they believed what it taught them. They saw me as a messenger from above -- an angel, I guess you'd call it. They didn't dare question me. People nowadays are much more troublesome. They all seem to think they have rights." He rolled his eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这个，”崔斯坦回答，“他刚刚从一栋正在燃烧的房子墙壁中穿出来，由不得他不信。而且，在那个年代，你们那里的人们要比现在虔诚得多。他们不会质疑教会，而且对教会传导的东西深信不疑。他们把我当成了天上派来的信使—大概，也就是你们口中所谓的天使。他们不敢对我妄加怀疑。现在的人就要麻烦得多。他们全都觉得自己享有各种权利。”他眼珠转了转。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Just a man. I remember being tall and muscular, with a beard." He paused at the look on her face. Her lips were twisted together to stop herself from giggling. "Lots of men had beards, big bushy ones. I had a moustache, too. I quite liked it; it was nice and warm."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“就是个男人的模样。我记得是个身材高大的男子汉，还留着胡子。”他顿了顿，观察了一下她的表情。她使劲抿嘴，免得咯咯笑出声来，“许多男人都蓄胡须，那种浓密的大胡子。我也有小胡子，我喜欢留这样的胡子，暖融融的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
