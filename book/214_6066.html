<div class="line_en">It was longer than the squire imagined ere we were ready for the sea, and none of our first plans -- not even Dr. Livesey's, of keeping me beside him -- could be carried out as we intended. The doctor had to go to London for a physician to take charge of his practice; the squire was hard at work at Bristol; and I lived on at the hall under the charge of old Redruth, the gamekeeper, almost a prisoner, but full of sea-dreams and the most charming anticipations of strange islands and adventures. I brooded by the hour together over the map, all the details of which I well remembered. Sitting by the fire in the housekeeper's room, I approached that island in my fancy from every possible direction; I explored every acre of its surface; I climbed a thousand times to that tall hill they call the Spy-glass, and from the top enjoyed the most wonderful and changing prospects. Sometimes the isle was thick with savages, with whom we fought, sometimes full of dangerous animals that hunted us, but in all my fancies nothing occurred to me so strange and tragic as our actual adventures.</div>

None of them dare, however, to deny the merits of the ship.</div>

Imagine the abominable age we live in!</div>

<div class="line_en">I was standing on the dock, when, by the merest accident, I fell in talk with him. I found he was an old sailor, kept a public-house, knew all the seafaring men in Bristol, had lost his health ashore, and wanted a good berth as cook to get to sea again. He had hobbled down there that morning, he said, to get a smell of the salt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当时我正站在船坞里，极其偶然的机会，我和他攀谈起来。我发现他是个老水手，开了问酒馆，熟知布里斯托尔的所有船员，在岸上健康状况不佳，想谋个厨子这样的好差事，再回到海上。他说那天早晨他跛着脚到了那儿，是想闻闻海盐的味儿。">查看中文翻译</div>

Between Silver and myself we got together in a few days a company of the toughest old salts imaginable -- not pretty to look at, but fellows, by their faces, of the most indomitable spirit. I declare we could fight a frigate.</div>

<div class="line_en">Postscript -- I did not tell you that Blandly, who, by the way, is to send a consort after us if we don't turn up by the end of August, had found an admirable fellow for sailing master -- a stiff man, which I regret, but in all other respects a treasure. Long John Silver unearthed a very competent man for a mate, a man named Arrow. I have a boatswain who pipes, Livesey; so things shall go man-o'-war fashion on board the good ship HISPANIOLA.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="又及——我还没向你讲那个布兰德利，他顺便提起，要是我们八月底还没返回来的话，他会派一艘船去寻找我们。他已找到了一个可尊敬的朋友来做我们的船长——一个固执的人，这点令我惋惜，不过，从其他各方面看，是个好手。高个子约翰·西尔弗找到了个相当有能力的人来担任大副，这人叫埃罗。我有个吹哨子召集水手的水手长，利弗西；这样一来，在伊斯班袅拉号船上，事情将以军舰上的方式来进行。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">You can fancy the excitement into which that letter put me. I was half beside myself with glee; and if ever I despised a man, it was old Tom Redruth, who could do nothing but grumble and lament. Any of the under-gamekeepers would gladly have changed places with him; but such was not the squire's pleasure, and the squire's pleasure was like law among them all. Nobody but old Redruth would have dared so much as even to grumble.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="你能想像得出这封信带给我的兴奋。我高兴得忘乎所以了。可要说我曾轻视过人，那就是老汤姆·雷卓斯了，他竟在那儿一个劲儿地发牢骚和叹气。任何一个猎场看守者的下手都乐于和他换换位置。但乡绅是不会愿意这样的，而乡绅的意愿在他们中就像是法律一样，除了老雷卓斯，还没人敢这么抱怨哩。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was on seeing that boy that I understood, for the first time, my situation. I had thought up to that moment of the adventures before me, not at all of the home that I was leaving; and now, at sight of this clumsy stranger, who was to stay here in my place beside my mother, I had my first attack of tears. I am afraid I led that boy a dog's life, for as he was new to the work, I had a hundred opportunities of setting him right and putting him down, and I was not slow to profit by them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="只有当见到了这个男孩的时候，我才头一回懂得了我的处境。我曾经仔细想过将面临的危险，却压根儿没想过我即将离开的这个家；而现在一见到这个笨手笨脚的、就要代替我留在母亲身边的新手，我的泪水忽地涌上来。我恐怕我带给那个男孩的是艰难、屈辱的生活，因为他对这工作很生疏，使我上百次地纠正和贬低他，没有让他慢慢地适应。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The next morning he and I set out on foot for the Admiral Benbow, and there I found my mother in good health and spirits. The captain, who had so long been a cause of so much discomfort, was gone where the wicked cease from troubling. The squire had had everything repaired, and the public rooms and the sign repainted, and had added some furniture -- above all a beautiful armchair for mother in the bar. He had found her a boy as an apprentice also so that she should not want help while I was gone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天早上，他和我步行出门，到了“本葆海军上将”旅店，在那儿，我发现我的母亲身体和精神都很好。船长，曾经长时间以来一直是这么多不快事件的根源的那个人，已经进了坟墓，这恶人再也不能叨扰我们了。乡绅已派人把所有的东西都修复好了，酒吧间和招牌都重新油漆过，还添了些新家具——首先，在酒吧里为我母亲添了把漂亮的圈椅。他还给她找来了个男孩当学徒，以便我走后她不缺帮手。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The mail picked us up about dusk at the Royal George on the heath. I was wedged in between Redruth and a stout old gentleman, and in spite of the swift motion and the cold night air, I must have dozed a great deal from the very first, and then slept like a log up hill and down dale through stage after stage, for when I was awakened at last it was by a punch in the ribs, and I opened my eyes to find that we were standing still before a large building in a city street and that the day had already broken a long time.</div>

<div class="line_en">The night passed, and the next day, after dinner, Redruth and I were afoot again and on the road. I said good-bye to Mother and the cove where I had lived since I was born, and the dear old Admiral Benbow -- since he was repainted, no longer quite so dear. One of my last thoughts was of the captain, who had so often strode along the beach with his cocked hat, his sabre-cut cheek, and his old brass telescope. Next moment we had turned the corner and my home was out of sight.</div>

Thither we had now to walk, and our way, to my great delight, lay along the quays and beside the great multitude of ships of all sizes and rigs and nations. In one, sailors were singing at their work, in another there were men aloft, high over my head, hanging to threads that seemed no thicker than a spider's. Though I had lived by the shore all my life, I seemed never to have been near the sea till then. The smell of tar and salt was something new. I saw the most wonderful figureheads, that had all been far over the ocean. I saw, besides, many old sailors, with rings in their ears, and whiskers curled in ringlets, and tarry pigtails, and their swaggering, clumsy sea-walk; and if I had seen as many kings or archbishops I could not have been more delighted.</div>
