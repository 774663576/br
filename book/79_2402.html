<div class="line_en">Late that afternoon Jack got a cot from the first-floor storage room and put it in the corner of their bedroom. Wendy had expected that the boy would be half the night getting to sleep, but Danny was nodding before "The Waltons" was half over, and fifteen minutes after they had tucked biro in he was far down in sleep, moveless, one band tucked under his cheek. Wendy sat watching him, holding her place in a fat paperback copy of Cashelmara with one finger. Jack sat at his desk, looking at his play.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Nothing." He looked down at the play with smoldering ill-temper. How could he have thought it was good? It was puerile. It had been done a thousand times. Worse, he had no idea how to finish it. Once it had seemed simple enough. Denker, in a fit of rage, seizes the poker from beside the fireplace and beats saintly Gary to death. Then, standing spread-legged over the body, the bloody poker in one hand, he screams at the audience: "It's here somewhere and I will find it!" Then, as the lights dim and the curtain is slowly drawn, the audience sees Gary's body face down on the forestage as Denker strides to the upstage bookcase and feverishly begins pulling books from the shelves, looking at them, throwing them aside. He had thought it was something old enough to be new, a play whose novelty alone might be enough to see it through a successful Broadway run: a tragedy in five acts.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没什么。”他低头看着剧本，心里烦躁得直冒烟。他怎么会认为这个剧本很不错呢？写得太幼稚了，毫无新意可言，更糟糕的是，他不知道该给它安排一个什么样的结尾。当初，这似乎很简单。邓克尔在一阵狂怒之中抓起壁炉边的拨火棍，活活打死了圣徒般的加里。然后，邓克尔两腿叉开站在尸体上，手里拿着血淋淋的拨火棍，冲观众叫道：“就在这里的什么地方，我会找到的！”然后，灯光暗下去，帷幕徐徐拉上，观众看到加里的尸首伏在舞台前部，邓克尔大步来到舞台后部的书橱边，发狂般地把书从架子上扯出来，看上一眼，然后扔到一边。杰克当初认为，这出五幕悲剧单凭新颖独到这一点就足以走红百老汇。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There had been bad parents, the father a beater as his own father had been, the mother a limp and silent dishrag as his mother had been. A homosexual experience in grammar school. Public humiliation. Worse experiences in high school and college. He had been arrested and sent to an institution after exposing himself to a pair of little girls getting off a school bus. Worst of all, he had been dismissed from the institution, let back out onto the streets, because the man in charge had decided he was all right. This man's name had been Grimmer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他有和杰克的父母一样的不良父母：动辄拿孩子出气的父亲，懦弱无能的母亲。他有小学时的同性恋经验，并当众受过污辱。在中学和大学，他还有更加屈辱的经历：他当着正下校车的两个小女孩扒下了自己的裤子，随即就被捕了，后来又被送进了一家精神病医院。最糟糕的是，那家医院把他放了出来，让他重新流落街头，因为医院院长认为他是个正常人。院长名叫格利默。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But, in addition to his sudden diversion of interest to the Overlooks history, something else had happened. He had developed opposing feelings about his characters. This was something quite new. Ordinarily he liked all of his characters, the good and the bad. He was glad he did. It allowed him to try to see all of their sides and understand their motivations more clearly. His favorite story, sold to a small southern Maine magazine called Contraband for copies, had been a piece called "The Monkey Is Here, Paul DeLong." It had been about a child molester about to commit suicide in his furnished room. The child molester's name had been Paul DeLong, Monkey to his friends. Jack had liked Monkey very much. He sympathized with Monkey's bizarre needs knowing that Monkey was not the only one to blame for the three rape-murders in his past.</div>

<div class="line_en">Grimmer had known that Monkey DeLong was exhibiting deviant symptoms, but he had written the good, hopeful report and had let him go anyway. Jack liked and sympathized with Grimmer, too. Grimmer had to run an understaffed and underfunded institution and try to keep the whole thing together with spit, baling wire, and nickel-and-dime appropriations from a state legislature who had to go back and face the voters. Grimmer knew that Monkey could interact with other people, that he did not soil his pants or try to stab his fellow inmates with the scissors. He did not think he was Napoleon. The staff psychiatrist in charge of Monkey's case thought there was a better-than-even chance that Monkey could make it on the street, and they both knew that the longer a man is in an institution the more he comes to need that closed environment, like a junkie with his smack. And meanwhile, people were knocking down the doors. Paranoids, schizoids, cycloids, semicatatonics, men who claimed to have gone to heaven in flying saucers, women who had burned their children's sex organs off with Bic lighters, alcoholics, pyromaniacs, kleptomaniacs, manic-depressives, suicidals.</div>

<div class="line_en">Originally conceived as a bright boy more cursed with money than blessed with it, a boy who wanted more than anything to compile a good record so he could go to a good university because he had earned admission and not because his father had pulled strings, he had become to Jack a kind of simpering Goody Two-shoes, a postulant before the altar of knowledge rather than a sincere acolyte, an outward paragon of Boy Scout virtues, inwardly cynical, filled not with real brilliance (as he had first been conceived) but only with sly animal cunning. All through the play he unfailingly addressed Denker as "sir," just as Jack had taught his own son to address those older and those in authority as "sir." He thought that Danny used the word quite sincerely, and Gary Benson as originally conceived had too, but as he had begun Act V, it had come more and more strongly to him that Gary was using the word satirically, outwardly straight-faced while the Gary Benson inside was mugging and leering at Denker.</div>

Who was now faced with ruin over this handsome, innocent-seeming rich boy who had cheated on his Final Composition and had then cunningly covered his tracks. Jack had seen Denker the teacher as not much different from the strutting South American little Caesars in their banana kingdoms, standing dissidents up against the wall of the handiest squash or handball court, a super-zealot in a comparatively small puddle, a man whose every whim becomes a crusade. In the beginning he had wanted to use his play as a microcosm to say something about the abuse of power.</div>

<div class="line_en">"It would mean leaving you alone because you can't snowshoe worth beans. It would be maybe three days of not knowing. Would you want that?" His hand dropped to the second button, slipped it, and the beginning of her cleavage was exposed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这样的话，你就得单独留下来，因为你没学会雪地行走。也许三天之内互无音信，你希望这样吗？”他的手滑下来，解开了第二颗钮扣，她乳沟的上端露了出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He had stopped twisting and turning. His thumb had crept back into his mouth. So that was all right. But Jack was leaving something out of the picture. It was too bleak. There was something else… what?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他已经停止了扭动，拇指含在嘴里。看来，一切又恢复了正常。可是，杰克漏掉了一件事没讲出来，这件事太吓人了…什么事？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She made a soft sound -- from his words or in reaction to his gentle pressure on her breast, he couldn't tell. He raised his hand slightly and undid the top button of her shirt. Wendy shifted her legs slightly. All at once her jeans seemed too tight, slightly irritating in a pleasant sort of way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她轻轻地呻吟了一声——他不知道是因为他的话还是因为他的搓揉。他稍稍抬起手，解开了她衬衣的第一颗扣子。温迪挪了挪腿，突然觉得牛仔裤有点紧，这微微地刺激着她，让她觉得很舒服。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"If we stay put," Jack said, unbuttoning the third and fourth buttons with that same deliberate slowness, "a ranger from the park or a game warden is going to poke in here just to find out how we're doing. At that point we simply tell him we want down. He'll see to it." He slipped her naked breasts into the wide V of the open shirt, bent, and molded his lips around the stem of a nipple. It was hard and erect. He slipped his tongue slowly back and forth across it in a way he knew she liked. Wendy moaned a little and arched her back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“要是我们待在这里不走，”杰克边说，边慢吞吞地解开了第三、第四颗钮扣。“森林管理员或狩猎监督员会来查看我们的下落。到时候我们只消告诉他我们想下山去，他会负责办好这件事的。”他把她裸露的双乳滑进衬衣的“V”形敞口里，低头将一只乳头含进口中。乳头硬了，挺直起来，他用舌头慢慢地来回舔舐着——他知道温迪喜欢这样。温迪小声呻吟着，她的背拱了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="后来，除了丹尼从他的房间里带来的夜灯外，房间里的灯都灭了，她躺在杰克的臂弯里，心情十分平静。她发现自己实在难以相信他们竟与一个杀气腾腾的偷住者分享着远望饭店。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“不知道。但是，肯定不是通常意义上的鬼，很可能是那些在这里住过的人的感情残留物，有好的也有坏的。这样讲的话，我认为每家大饭店都有鬼，尤其是那些有了年头的老饭店。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He gave her a brief squeeze. "We know he goes into… well, trances, for want of a better word… from time to time. We know that when he's in them he sometimes… sees?… things he doesn't understand. If precognitive trances are possible, they're probably functions of the subconscious mind. Freud said that the subconscious never speaks to us in literal language. Only in symbols. If you dream about being in a bakery where no one speaks English, you may be worried about your ability to support your family. Or maybe just that no one understands you. I've read that the falling dream is a standard outlet for feelings of insecurity. Games, little games. Conscious on one side of the net, subconscious on the other, serving some cockamamie image back and forth. Same with mental illness, with hunches, all of that. Why should precognition be any different? Maybe Danny really did see blood all over the walls of the Presidential Suite. To a kid his age, the image of blood and the concept of death are nearly interchangeable. To kids, the image is always more accessible than the concept, anyway. William Carlos Williams knew that, he was a pediatrician. When we grow up, concepts gradually get easier and we leave the images to the poets… and I'm just rambling on."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他用力搂了她一下。“他时不时进入…呃，恍惚状态——我想不起更贴切的词。我们知道，处于这种状态时，他有时…看到？…一些他不明白的东西。如果具有预见性的恍惚状态果真存在的话，它们很可能是潜意识引起的。弗洛伊德说，潜意识从来不用文字语言对我们说话，只用符号。如果你梦到自己待在一家谁都不讲英语的面包店里，你可能正在为无力养活家人而担忧，要么只是因为没有人能理解你。有些书里还说坠崖梦是不安全感的标准流露。把戏，都是些小把戏。意识在网的一边，潜意识在另一边，提供一些忽隐忽现的荒诞图像。精神病如此，直觉也是这么回事。预知为什么就应该不同呢？也许丹尼真的看到了总统套间墙上满是血污的景象。对他这样年纪的孩子来说，血的图像和死亡的概念几乎是可能互换的。另外，对小孩来说，图像总是比概念容易接受得多。威廉·卡洛斯·威廉姆斯很了解这一点，他是一位儿科专家。我们渐渐长大成人，概念也就变得容易理解起来，于是，我们把图像留给了诗人…我扯得太远了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes. Sometimes people who believe deeply in Christ's divinity exhibit bleeding marks on their hands and feet during the Holy Week. It was more common in the Middle Ages than now. In those days such people were considered blessed by God. I don't think the Catholic Church proclaimed any of it as out-and-out miracles, which was pretty smart of them. Stigmata isn't much different from some of the things the yogis can do. It's better understood now, that's all. The people who understand the interaction between the mind and the body -- study it, I mean, no one understands it -- believe we have a lot more control over our involuntary functions than they used to think. You can slow your heartbeat if you think about it enough. Speed up your own metabolism. Make yourself sweat more. Or make yourself bleed."</div>

There would be no job, not even part-time or seasonal, except maybe shoveling out driveways for three dollars a shot. The picture of John Torrance, thirty years old, who had once published in Esquire and who had harbored dreams -- not at all unreasonable dreams, he felt of becoming a major American writer during the next decade, with a shovel from the Sidewinder Western Auto on his shoulder, ringing doorbells… that picture suddenly came to him much more clearly than the hedge lions and he clenched his fists tighter still, feeling the fingernails sink into his palms and draw blood in mystic quarter-moon shapes. John Torrance, standing in line to change his sixty dollars into food stamps, standing in line again at the Sidewinder Methodist Church to get donated commodities and dirty looks from the locals. John Torrance explaining to Al that they'd just had to leave, had to shut down the boiler, had to leave the Overlook and all it contained open to vandals or thieves on snow machines because, you see, Al, attendez-vous, Al, there are ghosts up there and they have it in for my boy. Good-by, Al. Thoughts of Chapter Four, Spring Comes for John Torrance. What then? Whatever then? They might be able to get to the West Coast in the VW, he supposed. A new fuel pump would do it. Fifty miles west of here and it was all downhill, you could damn near put the bug in neutral and coast to Utah. On to sunny California, land of oranges and opportunity. A man with his sterling record of alcoholism, student-beating, and ghost-chasing would undoubtedly be able to write his own ticket.</div>

Consider the difference if they didn't go down, if they could somehow stick it out. The play would get finished. One way or the other, he would tack an ending onto it. His own uncertainty about his characters might add an appealing touch of ambiguity to his original ending. Perhaps it would even make him some money, it wasn't impossible. Even lacking that, Al might well convince the Stovington Board to rehire him. He would be on pro of course, maybe for as long as three years, but if he could stay sober and keep writing, he might not have to stay at Stovington for three years. Of course he hadn't cared much for Stovington before, he had felt stifled, buried alive, but that had been an immature reaction. Furthermore, how much could a man enjoy teaching when he went through his first three classes with a skull-busting hangover every second or third day? It wouldn't be that way again.

<div class="line_en">As the light swayed above him and the shadows danced and flapped, he began to swing the cane, bringing it down again and again, his arm rising and falling like a machine. George's bloody protecting fingers fell away from his head and Jack brought the cane down again and again, and on his neck and shoulders and back and arms. Except that the cane was no longer precisely a cane; it seemed to be a mallet with some kind of brightly striped handle. A mallet with a hard side and soft side. The business end was clotted with blood and hair. And the flat, whacking sound of the mallet against flesh had been replaced with a hollow booming sound, echoing and reverberating. His own voice had taken on this same quality, bellowing, disembodied. And yet, paradoxically, it sounded weaker, slurred, petulant… as if he were drunk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="电灯在上面荡来荡去，满屋的阴影如群魔之乱舞。他又抡起了棍子，一次又一次地砸下，手臂像机械一样起落不止。乔治血淋淋的手指从头上滑落下去，杰克的棍子雨点般地落在他脖上、肩膀、背部和胳膊上。只是棍子已不再是棍子，而好像是柄上带着鲜艳条纹的木槌，一头硬，一头软。击打的一头沾满了血污和毛发。槌子打在肉体上发出的闷响变成了空洞的嘭嘭声，回荡着，回荡着。他自己的声音也带上了同样的色彩，嗥叫着，没有人性，但是，矛盾的是，这声音听起来却十分虚弱，含混，狂躁…好像他喝醉了一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
