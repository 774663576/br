<div class="line_en">For the first ninety-seven days after Hans Hubermann's return in April 1943, everything was fine. On many occasions he was pensive about the thought of his son fighting in Stalingrad, but he hoped that some of his luck was in the boy's blood.</div>

<div class="line_en">On his third night at home, he played the accordion in the kitchen. A promise was a promise. There was music, soup, and jokes, and the laughter of a fourteen-year-old girl.</div>

<div class="line_en">After a week, Hans resumed his service, traveling into the city to one of the army offices. He said that there was a good supply of cigarettes and food there, and sometimes he was able to bring home some cookies or extra jam. It was like the good old days. A minor air raid in May. A "heil Hitler" here or there and everything was fine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个星期后，汉斯重新开始服役，他去了慕尼黑城里，在军队的某个办事处干活。他说那里有好多香烟和食物，有时候还能给家里捎点果酱和点心。时间仿佛又倒回到过去的好日子。五月只发生了一场小规模的空袭。你时不时能听见一声“希特勒万岁”，但一切还算安好。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The only difference this time was that they were brought from the opposite direction. They were taken through to the neighboring town of Nebling to scrub the streets and do the cleanup work that the army refused to do. Late in the day, they were marched back to camp, slow and tired, defeated.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="唯一的区别是，这一次他们来自相反的方向。他们被带到附近的小镇内贝林，去那里清扫街道，做军队不愿意做的善后工作。到了晚上，疲惫的他们还得无精打采地回集中营去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was the same old lady who announced the Jews the first time Liesel saw them. On ground level, her face was a prune. Her eyes were the dark blue of a vein. And her prediction was accurate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莉泽尔第一次见到犹太人游街的时候，便是这位老妇人宣布他们的到来。这一次站在街上的她，一张脸皱成了梅子干的模样，只不过颜色像纸那么白。她的眼眸是静脉一般的深蓝色，而她的预言一贯准确。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the heart of summer, Molching was delivered a sign of things to come. It moved into sight like it always did. First the bobbing head of a soldier and the gun poking at the air above him. Then the ragged chain of clinking Jews.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="进入仲夏时节，莫尔辛呈现出一副山雨欲来的迹象。最初的景象没什么分别。一群摇头晃脑的士兵把步枪扛在肩头，冲着天空，后面跟着一长串衣衫褴褛、锁链哐当作响的犹太人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Again, Liesel searched for Max Vandenburg, thinking that he could easily have ended up in Dachau without being marched through Molching. He was not there. Not on this occasion.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="在七月这一天（莉泽尔后来数了数，发现这是爸爸回家的第九十八天），她站在街旁仔细审视这些悲哀的犹太人，从中寻找马克斯的身影。就算一无所获，至少也能缓和只是眼睁睁看着他们走过的痛苦。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That's a horrible thought, she would write in her Himmel Street basement, but she knew it to be true. The pain of watching them. What about their pain? The pain of stumbling shoes and torment and the closing gates of the camp?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这是一个可怕的想法。”她在希默尔街的地下室里写道，但她也明白这是自己的真实想法。眼睁睁看着他们走过的痛苦。那他们的痛苦该怎么办？那脚步磕磕绊绊的痛苦，承受酷刑的痛苦，被集中营紧闭的大门禁锢的痛苦，又该怎么办？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They came through twice in ten days, and soon after, the anonymous, prune-faced woman on Munich Street was proven absolutely correct. Suffering had most definitely come, and if they could blame the Jews as a warning or prologue, they should have blamed the Fuhrer and his quest for Russia as the actual cause -- for when Himmel Street woke later in July, a returned soldier was discovered to be dead. He was hanging from one of the rafters in a laundry up near Frau Diller's. Another human pendulum. Another clock, stopped.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="十天里，他们两次经过莫尔辛小镇，慕尼黑大街上那个脸像梅子干的无名老妇果然没说错。苦难确实降临到了此地，他们也许可以怪罪犹太人，认为这些人是不祥之兆，但实际的原因应该归咎于元首和他入侵苏联的野心。当希默尔街在七月末的一个清晨醒来时，一位退伍军人死去了。他吊死在迪勒太太的商店附近一间洗衣店的房梁上。又一支人类的钟摆，又一座人类的时钟停止了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Of course, I did not see Liesel Meminger at all that day. As is usually the case, I advised myself that I was far too busy to remain on Himmel Street to listen to the screams.

<div class="line_en">I did not hear the detonation of an old man's voice when he found the hanging body, nor the sound of running feet and jaw-dropped gasps when other people arrived. I did not hear a skinny man with a mustache mutter, "Crying shame, a damn shame…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后来的许多声音我都没有听到，我没有听到一位老人发现悬着的尸体时的惊叫，也没有听到人们纷纷赶来时匆忙的脚步声和喘气声。我也没有听到一位留着小胡子的瘦削男子的喃喃自语：“太可耻了，真是可耻…”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I did not see Frau Holtzapfel laid out flat on Himmel Street, her arms out wide, her screaming face in total despair. No, I didn't discover any of that until I came back a few months later and read something called The Book Thief. It was explained to me that in the end, Michael Holtzapfel was worn down not by his damaged hand or any other injury, but by the guilt of living.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我也没有看见霍尔茨埃普费尔太太，她躺在希默尔街上，胳膊伸展开来，一脸绝望地尖叫。当时我对这一切全不知情，直到几个月后，我故地重游，读到了一本叫《偷书贼》的书，才知道了这些事情。它告诉我，米夏埃尔·霍尔茨埃普费尔最后不是因为残疾的手或者其他伤病才厌倦人世，他自寻短见，是因为承受不住自己活下来的罪恶感。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the lead-up to his death, the girl had realized that he wasn't sleeping, that each night was like poison. I often imagine him lying awake, sweating in sheets of snow, or seeing visions of his brother's severed legs. Liesel wrote that sometimes she almost told him about her own brother, like she did with Max, but there seemed a big difference between a long-distance cough and two obliterated legs. How do you console a man who has seen such things? Could you tell him the Fuhrer was proud of him, that the Fuhrer loved him for what he did in Stalingrad? How could you even dare? You can only let him do the talking. The dilemma, of course, is that such people save their most important words for after, when the surrounding humans are unlucky enough to find them. A note, a sentence, even a question, or a letter, like on Himmel Street in July 1943.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在他寻死之前，莉泽尔就发现他不再睡觉了，每个夜晚对他来说都像一剂毒药。我常常想象他夜不能寐的模样，在层层白雪之下汗流不止，或者脑海里反复闪现弟弟被炸飞的双腿。莉泽尔在书里写道，有时候她想像跟马克斯倾诉那样，把自己和弟弟的故事讲给米夏埃尔听，但是漫长路途中的咳嗽和炸飞的双腿之间的差别太大了。当一个人目睹过这样的惨状，你又怎么能安慰得了他？难道你能跟他说，元首为他感到骄傲，元首欣赏他在斯大林格勒为国家做出的奉献？这种话你怎么说得出口？你只能由着他向你倾诉。当然，矛盾就在于这类人总把最重要的心里话留到最后，等周围的人知晓时为时已晚。那可能是一张字条，一句话，甚至是一句诘问，也可能是一封遗书，就像一九四三年七月在希默尔街上发生的那样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The morning sky stood blazing behind him as the wiry woman made her way past. She ran sobbing to the gathering farther up on Himmel Street.
