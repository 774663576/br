<div class="line_en">"That's my good boy." The rule was hers; Cersei did not mean to give it up until Tommen came of age. I waited, so can he. I waited half my life. She had played the dutiful daughter, the blushing bride, the pliant wife. She had suffered Robert's drunken groping, Jaime's jealousy, Renly's mockery, Varys with his titters, Stannis endlessly grinding his teeth. She had contended with Jon Arryn, Ned Stark, and her vile, treacherous, murderous dwarf brother, all the while promising herself that one day it would be her turn. If Margaery Tyrell thinks to cheat me of my hour in the sun, she had bloody well think again.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Grand Maester had been especially querulous in council of late. At the last session he had complained bitterly about the men that Aurane Waters had chosen to captain her new dromonds. Waters meant to give the ships to younger men, whilst Pycelle argued for experience, insisting that the commands should go to those captains who had survived the fires of the Blackwater. "Seasoned men of proven loyalty," he called them. Cersei called them old, and sided with Lord Waters. "The only thing these captains proved was that they know how to swim," she'd said. "No mother should outlive her children, and no captain should outlive his ship." Pycelle had taken the rebuke with ill grace.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大学士最近在御前会议上难得地激动了几回。比如上次开会，他强烈抗议奥雷恩·维水新任命的大帆船船长人选——维水想把位子留给年轻人，派席尔看中的则是经验，坚持要任用自黑水河一战幸存的船长。“他们不仅老练，而且在战场上证明了自己的忠诚。”国师评价，但瑟曦认为这帮人都太老朽，表示支持维水大人的意见。“他们证明了自己精于游泳，”太后说，“做母亲的应该舍身卫子，当船长的应该与船俱沉。”对此，派席尔很不服气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Still, it was an ill way to break her fast, and Cersei's day did not soon improve. She spent the rest of the morning with Lord Gyles and his ledger books, listening to him cough about stars and stags and dragons. After him Lord Waters arrived, to report that the first three dromonds were nearing completion and beg for more gold to finish them in the splendor they deserved. The queen was pleased to grant him his request. Moon Boy capered as she took her midday meal with members of the merchant guilds and listened to them complain about sparrows wandering the streets and sleeping in the squares. I may need to use the gold cloaks to chase these sparrows from the city, she was thinking, when Pycelle intruded.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="想到灰烬，早餐也没味道了，其后发生的事件也未能转变她的心情。早晨剩下的时间，瑟曦与盖尔斯大人和他的账簿为伴，听对方在咳嗽间歇中谈论金龙、银鹿与铜星。随后觐见的是维水大人，他报告说有三艘大帆船即将竣工，并请求拨付更多预算，好让它们看起来雄伟华贵，符合王家威仪。太后欣然应诺。接着她一边观赏月童的跳跃表演，一边和商人公会的代表们共进午餐，倾听对方抱怨麻雀们在街市中四处游荡，还睡满了广场。我是不是该让金袍子把他们轰出城去？她正思考时，派席尔来了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The man's head and hands have been mounted above the walls of White Harbor. Lord Wyman avows this, and the Freys confirm. They have seen the head there, with an onion in its mouth. And the hands, one marked by his shortened fingers."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“千真万确。走私贩的人头和手臂被挂在白港的高墙上示众，威曼保证就是他，而佛雷家的人证实其所言非虚。他们见过那颗脑袋——嘴里含着一颗洋葱——还见到了那双手，其中一只手的指节全被削去了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Very good," said Cersei. "Send a bird to Manderly and inform him that his son will be returned forthwith, now that he has demonstrated his loyalty." White Harbor would soon return to the king's peace, and Roose Bolton and his bastard son were closing in on Moat Cailin from south and north. Once the Moat was theirs, they would join their strength and clear the ironmen out of Torrhen's Square and Deepwood Motte as well. That should win them the allegiance of Ned Stark's remaining bannermen when the time came to march against Lord Stannis.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“很好，”瑟曦道，“派一只乌鸦去曼德勒大人处，褒扬他的忠诚，声明我们立即释放他儿子。”看来白港很快会回归国王治下，而卢斯·波顿和他的私生子将毫无阻碍地南北夹击卡林湾，只等要塞陷落，波顿的军团便将荡平托伦方城与深林堡的铁民，最后再联合奈德·史塔克的诸侯们，进攻史坦尼斯大人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That afternoon the dour Braavosi envoy turned up for his audience. Cersei had put him off for a fortnight and would have gladly put him off another year, but Lord Gyles claimed he could no longer deal with the man… though the queen was starting to wonder if Gyles was capable of doing anything but coughing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当天下午，古板的布拉佛斯使节再度求见。太后已经忽悠了他半个月，很想再拖个一年半载，但盖尔斯大人说自己再也应付不了了…哎，盖尔斯除了会咳嗽，还会什么呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Noho Dimittis, the Braavosi named himself. An irritating name for an irritating man. His voice was irritating too. Cersei shifted in her seat as he went on, wondering how long she must endure his hectoring. Behind her loomed the Iron Throne, its barbs and blades throwing twisted shadows across the floor.

<div class="line_en">"She likes his face. She touched his scars two days ago, he told me. 'What woman gave you these?' she asked. Osney never said it was a woman, but she knew. Might be someone told her. She's always touching him when they talk, he says. Straightening the clasp on his cloak, brushing back his hair, and like that. One time at the archery butts she had him show her how to hold a longbow, so he had to put his arms around her. Osney tells her bawdy jests, and she laughs and comes back with ones that are even bawdier. No, she wants him, that's plain, but…"</div>

Two others bring her breakfast and help her dress. She prays with her septa, reads with her cousin Elinor, sings with her cousin Alla, sews with her cousin Megga. When she's not off hawking with Janna Fossoway and Merry Crane, she's playing come-into-my-castle with that little Bulwer girl.

Beneath his jewels and feathers, Xho was little more than a wellborn beggar.

Tommen was growing fond of his new sworn shield, but Osney was proving himself less capable than she had hoped in the matter of Maid Margaery, and she had a different office in mind for his brother Osfryd.

The Estermonts were her good-kin through Robert, whose father had taken one of them to wife in what must have been a fit of lust or madness. By the time Cersei wed the king, Robert's lady mother was long dead, though both of her brothers had turned up for the wedding and stayed for half a year. Robert had later insisted on returning the courtesy with a visit to Estermont, a mountainous little island off Cape Wrath. The dank and dismal fortnight Cersei spent at Greenstone, the seat of House Estermont, was the longest of her young life. Jaime dubbed the castle "Greenshit" at first sight, and soon had Cersei doing it too.

As soon as Cersei closed her eyes, the king would steal off to console the poor lonely creature. One night she had Jaime follow him, to confirm her suspicions.

He could still boast a handsome mustache; elsewise, he had not aged well. His wavy blond hair had retreated, whilst his belly advanced inexorably against his doublet. As a catspaw he leaves much to be desired, she reflected. Still, he should serve. "Tyrion was a king's name before the dragons came. The Imp has despoiled it, but perhaps this child can restore the name to honor." If the bastard lives so long. "I know you are not to blame.

<div class="line_en">Better than cutting them out of their mother with a dagger, I suppose. Margaery's clumsy attempts at seduction were so obvious as to be laughable. Tommen is too young for kisses, so she gives him kittens. Cersei rather wished they were not black, though. Black cats brought ill luck, as Rhaegar's little girl had discovered in this very castle. She would have been my daughter, if the Mad King had not played his cruel jape on Father. It had to have been the madness that led Aerys to refuse Lord Tywin's daughter and take his son instead, whilst marrying his own son to a feeble Dornish princess with black eyes and a flat chest. The memory of the rejection still rankled, even after all these years.</div>

Ser Balman proved a great one for suggesting yet another flagon, and the queen did not think it prudent to refuse.

<div class="line_en">Many a night she had watched Prince Rhaegar in the hall, playing his silver-stringed harp with those long, elegant fingers of his. Had any man ever been so beautiful? He was more than a man, though. His blood was the blood of old Valyria, the blood of dragons and gods. When she was just a little girl, her father had promised her that she would marry Rhaegar. She could not have been more than six or seven. "Never speak of it, child," he had told her, smiling his secret smile that only Cersei ever saw. "Not until His Grace agrees to the betrothal. It must remain our secret for now." And so it had, though once she had drawn a picture of herself flying behind Rhaegar on a dragon, her arms wrapped tight about his chest.

<div class="line_en">Seventeen and new to knighthood, Rhaegar Targaryen had worn black plate over golden ringmail when he cantered onto the lists. Long streamers of red and gold and orange silk had floated behind his helm, like flames. Two of her uncles fell before his lance, along with a dozen of her father's finest jousters, the flower of the west. By night the prince played his silver harp and made her weep. When she had been presented to him, Cersei had almost drowned in the depths of his sad purple eyes. He has been wounded, she recalled thinking, but I will mend his hurt when we are wed. Next to Rhaegar, even her beautiful Jaime had seemed no more than a callow boy. The prince is going to be my husband, she had thought, giddy with excitement, and when the old king dies I'll be the queen. Her aunt had confided that truth to her before the tourney. "You must be especially beautiful," Lady Genna told her, fussing with her dress, "for at the final feast it shall be announced that you and Prince Rhaegar are betrothed."</div>
