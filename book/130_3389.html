<div class="line_en">"So. You have never been to our country before?" The Cameroonian immigration officer looked at me with suspicious eyes and flicked listlessly through my passport. Stains of perspiration, the shape of Africa, stretched down his shirt under the armpits, for this was Duala at the height of the hot, dry season. Each finger left a brown sweat stain on the pages.</div>

<div class="line_en">"That's right." I had learned never to disagree with African officials. It always ended up taking more time and costing more effort than simple passive acquiescence.

<div class="line_en">In reality, this was not my first visit but my second. Previously I had spent some eighteen months in a mountain village in the north studying a tribe of pagans as their resident anthropologist Since, however, my passport had been stolen by the enterprising rogues of Rome there was no incriminating evidence in the form of old visas to give me away. I congratulated myself on the bland uninformativeness of my nice new passport. This should all be rather easy. Should I confess to a prior visit, I would immediately be required to engage in an orgy of bureaucracy, giving dates of entry to and departure from the country, number of previous visa and so on. The sheer unreasonableness of requiring a mere traveller to carry all this in his head would serve as no defence.</div>

<div class="line_en">The official returned and began a minute inspection of the travel documents of a Libyan of deeply shifty appearance. This gentleman claimed to be a "general entrepreneur" and possessed an implausible amount of luggage. With breathtaking shamelessness, he had given as the reason for his visit "the search for commercial possibilities to benefit the Cameroonian people". To my great surprise, he was waved through without further formality.

<div class="line_en">In my first visit to the Dowayos, my mountain tribe, I had learned of the centrality of the circumcision ceremony to their whole culture. But, since it only takes place at six- or seven-year intervals, I had never been able to witness it. True, I had written down descriptions and photographed parts of the ceremony that are reproduced at other festivals, but the real thing had escaped me. Local contacts had tipped me off a month ago that the ceremony was imminent. Who knew when the ceremony would take place again -- if ever? It was a unique chance and one to be seized. I knew from previous experience that there was no chance of getting permission in time to do recognized fieldwork; I was therefore entering the country as a simple tourist. For myself, there was no inherent dishonesty in this; I would simply be doing what all tourists did -- take photographs. At the ceremony, there would certainly be other tourists, happily snapping away for the scrapbook. It seemed unreasonable that I, as an anthropologist, should not be allowed to do what a vacationing accountant could do.</div>

<div class="line_en">Somewhere in Africa, there must be taxi-drivers who are kind, peaceable, knowledgeable, honest and courteous. Alas, I have never found this place. The newcomer may expect, with reasonable certainty, to be robbed, cheated and abused. On a previous visit to Duala, before I was acquainted with the geography of the town, I had taken a taxi to a place that was less than half a mile away. The driver had pretended it was a good ten miles distant, charged a huge fare and driven me around in circles until I lost all sense of direction, profiting from my hire to deliver newspapers to outlying districts. Only when I sought to make my way back, did I glimpse the unmistakeable shape of my hotel a mere ten minutes" walk away. Taking an African taxi is almost always hard work. Often, it is much easier to walk.</div>

There was a short discussion and he sought to embark this vast woman who bore an enormous enamel bowl filled with lettuce. I protested. The enormous lady pushed with bowl and thighs. Cold water slopped down my leg. "She's going almost the same way. It cost you no more." He looked hurt. The lady tried to sell me a lettuce. We all argued and shook our fists.

<div class="line_en">Humphrey was evidently well known here. The hostess, an oriental lady of ceramic beauty, greeted him with a delicate smile and a bow. The proprietor, her husband, was a French expatriate who had spent many years in Indo-China. Honey-coloured children were presented, smiling in a line of descending age, to Humphrey. They bowed and embraced him, referring to him as "Tonton Oom-fray". Humphrey became a little maudlin. I thought I saw him wipe away a manly tear. The patron sat with us, pouring cassis and white wine amid mutual reminiscence and discussion of family news. It was revealed that Humphrey had a wife in the north of England as well as what he termed "a standing arrangement" in the capital.</div>

At the time of Humphrey's acquaintance with him, he had exulted in the possession of a white Peugeot car that was all his joy. It was not made plain how he had come by the car. This was rather glossed over. It seems that he and Humphrey had gone out to investigate the nightlife at a particularly seedy club called "The Swamp". An endearing habit of urban children throughout West Africa is to "guard" cars for their owners. In fact, it is an embryonic protection racket. In return for a small sum, the car is secure.
