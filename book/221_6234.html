<div class="line_en">But I couldn't. I couldn't look at him. Nathan had packed up Will's stuff, and I had met them both in the lobby the following morning -- Nathan still groggy from his hangover -- and from the moment we had to be in each other's company again, I refused to have anything to do with him. I was furious and miserable. There was an insistent, raging voice inside my head, which demanded to be as far as possible from Will. To go home. To never see him again.</div>

<div class="line_en">I managed to make myself busy for the entire wait at the airport. I found a thousand small tasks to do -- busying myself with luggage labels, buying coffee, perusing newspapers, going to the loo -- all of which meant that I didn't have to look at him. I didn't have to talk to him. But every now and then Nathan would disappear and we were left alone, sitting beside each other, the short distance between us jangling with unspoken recriminations.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在机场的整个等待时间，我一直忙东忙西。我找出了无数个要完成的小任务——贴行李标签，买咖啡，翻阅报纸，去洗手间——这些都意味着我不用去看他，我不用跟他说话。但内森不时会消失不见，只剩下我们两个在那儿，挨着彼此坐着，我们之间充斥着没有说出来的指责。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I couldn't speak. I nodded, and I watched Nathan's jaw stiffen briefly. He was stronger than I was, though. He was, after all, a professional. Within minutes he was back with Will, showing him something he had seen in a magazine, wondering aloud about the prospects for some football team they both knew of. Watching them, you would know nothing of the momentousness of the news I had just imparted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我不能说话。我点了点头，内森的下巴一下绷紧了。但他比我坚强，毕竟他是一个专业护理师。不出几分钟，他又回到威尔身边了，指给他看一本杂志中的什么东西，大声质疑着某个他们都知晓的足球队的前景。看着他们，你会觉得我刚才告诉内森的消息一点也不重要。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For once, he didn't get angry. That was almost the worst of it. He didn't get angry, and he didn't get sarcastic, and he simply grew quieter until he barely spoke. It was left to poor Nathan to bounce the conversation along, to ask questions about tea or coffee or spare packets of dry-roasted peanuts or whether anyone minded if he climbed past us to go to the loo.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="头一回，他没有生气，这是最糟糕的。他没有生气，没有冷言冷语，他只是越来越沉默，直到不再说话。只有可怜的内森努力撑住场面，问要不要茶、咖啡、多余的干烤的小袋花生，是否有人介意他经过我们去洗手间。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It probably sounds childish now, but it was not just a matter of pride. I couldn't bear it. I couldn't bear the thought that I would lose him, that he was so stubborn, and determined not to see what was good, what could be good, that he would not change his mind. I couldn't believe that he would stick to that one date, as if it were cast in stone. A million silent arguments rattled around my head. Why is this not enough for you? Why am I not enough for you? Why could you not have confided in me? If we'd had more time, would this have been different? Every now and then I would catch myself staring down at his tanned hands, those squared-off fingers, just inches from my own, and I would remember how our fingers felt entwined -- the warmth of him, the illusion, even in stillness, of a kind of strength -- and a lump would rise in my throat until I thought I could barely breathe and I had to retreat to the WC where I would lean over the sink and sob silently under the strip lighting. There were a few occasions, when I thought about what Will still intended to do, where I actually had to fight the urge to scream; I felt overcome by a kind of madness and thought I might just sit down in the aisle and howl and howl until someone else stepped in. Until someone else made sure he couldn't do it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在听起来有些孩子气，但这不仅仅有关自尊，我不能忍受。我不能忍受要失去他，他如此顽固，决定不去看好的那一面，不去看可以变好的事物，不去改变他的想法。我不能相信他会坚持那个日期，就像板上钉钉一样。我脑海中有数不清的无声的论据咔嗒响个不停。为什么这还不够？为什么对你来说，我还不够？为什么你不能相信我？要是我们有更多的时间，事情不会有变化吗？我不时盯着他晒成棕褐色的手，那些四方形的手指甲，离我的手只有几英寸远，我想起我们的手指如何互相缠绕——他的温暖，纵使在沉寂中也给我一种有力量的温暖——我的喉咙中就像噎了一个硬物一样，我再也没法呼吸，不得不躲到洗手间，趴在洗涤槽上，在条状照明灯下无声啜泣。有几次，一想到威尔仍然要做的事情，我不得不克制自己想要尖叫的冲动。我感觉一种疯狂的情绪将我压倒，觉得我可以就坐在过道上不停地哀号，直到有别人进来，直到其他人保证他不这么做。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The two men slept, and it came as something of a relief -- a brief respite from the tension. I stared at the television screen and, with every mile that we headed towards home, I felt my heart grow heavier, my anxiety greater. It began to occur to me then that my failure was not just my own; Will's parents were going to be devastated. They would probably blame me. Will's sister would probably sue me. And it was my failure for Will too. I had failed to persuade him. I had offered him everything I could, including myself, and nothing I had shown him had convinced him of a reason to keep living.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两个男人睡着了，我略微舒了一口气——暂时不用这么剑拔弩张了。我盯着电视屏幕，每离家近一英里，我的心就越发沉重，也更为焦虑。我的失败不仅仅是我自己的失败，威尔的父母也会崩溃的。他们或许会责怪我，威尔的妹妹会控告我。对于威尔来说也是失败，我没能劝说动他。我给他提供了我能提供的一切，包括我自己，但是没有一样东西让他相信有活下去的理由。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So although I looked childish -- although I seemed to the cabin staff (as I declined to talk to Will, to look at him, to feed him) as if I were the most heartless of women -- I knew that pretending he was not there was about the only way I could cope with these hours of enforced proximity. If I had believed Nathan capable of coping alone I would honestly have changed my flight, perhaps even disappeared until I could make sure that there was between us a whole continent, not just a few impossible inches.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管我看起来有些孩子气——虽然对于机舱工作人员来说（由于我拒绝跟威尔谈话，拒绝看他，拒绝喂他食物），我似乎是最无情的女人——我知道假装他不在那儿是我可以度过被迫与他这么接近的这几个小时的唯一方法。如果我相信内森可以一个人处理这件事，我真的会更改我的航班，或许甚至消失，直到我确认我们之间隔着整个大陆，而不是没法忍受的几英寸。">查看中文翻译</div>

The fact that I was going to have to live with this knowledge for the rest of my life made me feel almost dizzy.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was only in those last few hours, in the dark, that I allowed myself to look at him. My gaze slid slowly sideways from my glowing television screen until I gazed at him surreptitiously in the dim light of the little cabin. And as I took in his face, so tanned and handsome, so peaceful in sleep, a solitary tear rolled down my cheek. Perhaps in some way conscious of my scrutiny Will stirred, but didn't wake. And unseen by the cabin staff, by Nathan, I pulled his blanket slowly up around his neck, tucking it in carefully, to make sure, in the chill of the cabin air conditioning, that Will would not feel the cold.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后的这几个小时，在黑暗中，我才允许自己看他。我的目光从发光的电视缓缓转向侧边，偷偷瞥向机舱昏暗光线下的他。我看着他的脸，黝黑英俊，在睡梦中如此安详，一滴泪从我的面颊滚下来。也许意识到了我的注视，威尔微微动了一下，但并没有醒。工作人员和内森都没有在看，我慢慢把他的毯子拉到他脖子上，仔细地掖好，以免机舱上空调的冷气让威尔感到寒冷。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They were waiting at the Arrivals Gate. I had somehow known they would be. I had felt the faintly sick sensation expanding inside me even as we wheeled Will through passport control, fast-tracked by some well-meaning official even as I prayed that we would be forced to wait, stuck in a queue that lasted hours, preferably days. But no, we crossed the vast expanse of linoleum, me pushing the baggage trolley, Nathan pushing Will, and as the glass doors opened, there they were, standing at the barrier, side by side in some rare semblance of unity. I saw Mrs Traynor's face briefly light up as she saw Will and I thought, absently, Of course -- he looks so well. And, to my shame, I put on my sunglasses -- not to hide my exhaustion, but so that she wouldn't immediately see from my naked expression what it was I was going to have to tell her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们在接机厅等候，我就知道他们会在那里。我们推着威尔经过护照检查处时，我感觉体内些微的恶心感在膨胀，一个好心的官员加快了我们的程序，我甚至祈求我们能被迫等待，陷在一个长队里排好几个小时，最好排好几天。但是没有，我们走过一大片油地毡，我推着行李车，内森推着威尔。玻璃门打开时，他们就在那儿，栏杆旁边，肩并肩，装出一种罕见的和睦假象。特雷纳夫人看见威尔时脸上一下就有了神采，我分了神，当然了——他看起来好极了。我感到惭愧的是，我戴上了墨镜——不是为了掩盖我的疲惫，只是看不到我的表情，她就不会马上猜到我要告诉她的事情了。">查看中文翻译</div>
