<div class="line_en">The temperature was dropping. I could feel it through the down bag, through my jacket. I was fully dressed, my hiking boots still laced into place. It didn't make any difference. How could it be so cold? How could it keep getting colder? It had to bottom out sometime, didn't it?</div>

<div class="line_en">Edward sat as far from me as possible in the cramped space, afraid to even breathe on me when I was already so cold. It was too dark to see his face, but his voice was wild with worry, indecision, and frustration.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'm ok-k-k-k-k-k-kay," I protested. Judging from Edward's groan and the muted growl outside the tent, I hadn't convinced anyone. The wind rocked the tent roughly, and I shuddered in harmony with it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我很，很，很，好。”我反驳道。从爱德华饱受折磨的叹息声和帐篷外面降低音量的咆哮声判断，我没有让任何人信服。风肆元忌惮地撼动着帐篷，我和它协调地一起颤抖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"H-h-h-h-h-h." I wanted to say that he should still leave, but I couldn't get it past my teeth. I nearly bit my tongue off trying. At least Jacob did seem to be well equipped for the snow, better even than the others in his pack with his thicker, longer, shaggy russet fur. I wondered why that was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“呵，呵，呵。”我想说他还是应该离开，但是我说不出口。我试着说的时候差点咬下舌头。至少雅各布的确有应付这种天气的装备，甚至比狼人团体中其他人的装备更好，他那棕褐色的皮毛很凌乱，比他们的要长一些，也要浓密一些。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What do you want me to do?" Edward growled, too anxious to bother with politeness anymore. "Carry her through that? I don't see you making yourself useful. Why don't you go fetch a space heater or something?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你想要我做什么？”爱德华咆哮道，他太焦躁了，根本无心理会礼貌不礼貌的事情了。“抱着她穿过那里？我不明白你为什么认为这样会让自己更有用，为什么你不去取个空间加热器之类的东西？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I heard the sound of the zipper around the tent door pulling swiftly down.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我听见帐篷门上的拉链咝的一声飞快地拉了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Edward scowled. "That was hardly necessary," he muttered. "And that's the worst idea I've ever heard," he called more loudly.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jacob slid through the smallest opening he could manage, while the arctic air flowed in around him, a few flecks of snow falling to the floor of the tent. I shivered so hard it was a convulsion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雅各布从他能钻进的最小的缝隙里不知不觉地溜了进来，围绕在他周围的寒冷空气也飘了进来，几片雪花飘落在帐篷内的地面上。我颤抖得很厉害，就像抽搐一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="爱德华的手突然牢牢地抓住他的肩膀，想要阻止他，他的手在黝黑的皮肤映衬下像雪一样白。雅各布绷紧下巴，他的鼻尖气得冒烟了，身体因为冰冷的触碰弹了回去，胳膊上长长的肌肉自动地绷紧了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The parka's for tomorrow -- she's too cold to warm it up by herself. It's frozen." He dropped it by the door. "You said she needed a space heater, and here I am." Jacob held his arms as wide as the tent allowed. As usual, when he'd been running around as a wolf, he'd only thrown on the bare essentials -- just a pair of sweats, no shirt, no shoes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“派克明天穿——她太冷了，自己根本不能暖和起来，太严寒了。”他把衣服扔在门边，“你说她需要一个空间加热器，现在我来了。”雅各布把胳膊舒展得和帐篷一样宽。和往常一样，当他要变成狼在四周跑动的时候，他只会穿上必要的衣物——一条运动裤，不穿衬衣，不穿鞋子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Keep your hands off of her," Edward answered blackly.</div>

<div class="line_en">And then I couldn't object -- I didn't want to anymore. He was so warm. His arms constricted around me, holding me snugly against his bare chest. The heat was irresistible, like air after being underwater for too long. He cringed when I pressed my icy fingers eagerly against his skin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着我就无法反对了——我再也不想反对了。他那么温暖，他的胳膊抱紧我，让我暖和而舒服地躺在他赤裸的胸脯旁边。这种热量是无法抗拒的，就像空气在水底下封闭的时间太久了想要释放出来一样。当我迫不及待地把冰冷的十指贴在他的皮肤上时，他退缩了一下。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was already warm and snug inside the sleeping bag. Jacob's body heat seemed to radiate from every side -- maybe because there was so much of him.

<div class="line_cn" title="睡袋里面已经很暖和，很舒适了。雅各布身体的热量似乎从各个方向辐射开来——或许是因为他占了那么大的空间吧。我踢掉靴子，用脚指头推他的腿，他轻轻地跳了一下，接着低头把滚烫的脸颊强行贴在我麻木的耳朵上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I noticed that Jacob's skin had a woodsy, musky scent -- it fit the setting, here in the middle of the forest. It was nice. I wondered if the Cullens and the Quileutes weren't just playing up that whole odor issue because of their prejudices. Everyone smelled fine to me.</div>

<div class="line_en">The storm howled like an animal attacking the tent, but it didn't worry me now. Jacob was out of the cold, and so was I. Plus, I was simply too exhausted to worry about anything -- tired from just staying awake so late, and aching from the muscle spasms. My body relaxed slowly as I thawed, piece by frozen piece, and then turned limp.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="暴风雪就像动物袭击帐篷一样呼啸着，但是现在这已经不让我担心了。雅各布已经不在冰天雪地之中了，我也不再冰冷了。此外，我只是太疲惫而不能担心任何事情了——仅仅是因为这么晚了还是醒着的，因为肌肉痉挛引起的疼痛。随着我的身体一片一片地融化，我也开始放松了，然后变得柔软了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Edward spoke slowly. "Jacob, from the second that I realized that I loved her, I knew there were only four possibilities. The first alternative, the best one for Bella, would be if she didn't feel as strongly for me -- if she got over me and moved on. I would accept that, though it would never change the way I felt. You think of me as a… living stone -- hard and cold. That's true. We are set the way we are, and it is very rare for us to experience a real change. When that happens, as when Bella entered my life, it is a permanent change. There's no going back…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱德华娓娓道来：“雅各布，从我意识到我爱她的那一瞬间开始，我就知道只有四种可能。第一种选择，对贝拉最好的选择就是如果她没有像我一样感觉那么强烈——如果她可以忘记我，继续生活，我会接受的，尽管这永远不会改变我对她的感情。你认为我是个……活着的石头——既坚硬又冷漠，这是事实。我们生来就是如此，对我们而言经历真正的改变是非常罕见的。一旦发生，就像贝拉走进我的生活一样，就是永远的改变，没有回头路……">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The second alternative, the one I'd originally chosen, was to stay with her throughout her human life. It wasn't a good option for her, to waste her life with someone who couldn't be human with her, but it was the alternative I could most easily face. Knowing all along that, when she died, I would find a way to die, too. Sixty years, seventy years -- it would seem like a very, very short time to me… But then it proved much too dangerous for her to live in such close proximity with my world. It seemed like everything that could go wrong did. Or hung over us… waiting to go wrong. I was terrified that I wouldn't get those sixty years if I stayed near her while she was human.</div>
