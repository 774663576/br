<div class="line_en">Among the forces which sweep and play throughout the universe, untutored man is but a wisp in the wind. Our civilisation is still in a middle stage, scarcely beast, in that it is no longer wholly guided by instinct; scarcely human, in that it is not yet wholly guided by reason. On the tiger no responsibility rests. We see him aligned by nature with the forces of life -- he is born into their keeping and without thought he is protected. We see man far removed from the lairs of the jungles, his innate instincts dulled by too near an approach to free-will, his free- will not sufficiently developed to replace his instincts and afford him perfect guidance.</div>

<div class="line_en">He is becoming too wise to hearken always to instincts and desires; he is still too weak to always prevail against them. As a beast, the forces of life aligned him with them; as a man, he has not yet wholly learned to align himself with the forces. In this intermediate stage he wavers -- neither drawn in harmony with nature by his instincts nor yet wisely putting himself into harmony by his own free-will. He is even as a wisp in the wind, moved by every breath of passion, acting now by his will and now by his instincts, erring with one, only to retrieve by the other, falling by one, only to rise by the other -- a creature of incalculable variability. We have the consolation of knowing that evolution is ever in action, that the ideal is a light that cannot fail. He will not forever balance thus between good and evil. When this jangle of free-will instinct shall have been adjusted, when perfect under standing has given the former the power to replace the latter entirely, man will no longer vary. The needle of understanding will yet point steadfast and unwavering to the distinct pole of truth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他太聪明了，所以不会总是听从本能和欲望的摆布；但是他又不够坚强，不能总是战胜本能和欲望。当他还是动物时，他和生命力保持一致，受生命力的支配。但是当他成为人时，他还没有完全学会如何使自己与生命力相一致，使自己适应和控制生命力。他在这种中间阶段摇摆不定——既不是靠本能被动地与自然力保持一致，又不够聪明，不能靠自由意志主动地与自然力保持一致，取得和谐。他只是风中的弱草摇摆不定，受各种情感的影响。一会儿按意志行动，一会又按本能行事。如果他靠意志行动错了，他就靠本能来解救；如果他靠本能行动失败了，他就靠意志再站起来——总之，他是一种反复无常，无法预测的生物。我们唯一的欣慰是我们知道人类会不断地进化，而理想永远是可靠的灯塔，人类不会永远在善与恶之间徘徊。当自由意志和本能的矛盾得到调整，当充分的理性使自由意志具有完全代替本能的力量，人类就不会继续摇摆不定。理智的磁针将永远指向远处真理的磁极。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Carrie's new state was remarkable in that she saw possibilities in it. She was no sensualist, longing to drowse sleepily in the lap of luxury. She turned about, troubled by her daring, glad of her release, wondering whether she would get something to do, wondering what Drouet would do. That worthy had his future fixed for him beyond a peradventure. He could not help what he was going to do. He could not see clearly enough to wish to do differently. He was drawn by his innate desire to act the old pursuing part. He would need to delight himself with Carrie as surely as he would need to eat his heavy breakfast. He might suffer the least rudimentary twinge of conscience in whatever he did, and in just so far he was evil and sinning. But whatever twinges of conscience he might have would be rudimentary, you may be sure.</div>

<div class="line_en">It went this way on every occasion. Drouet did not leave her much alone. She had time for some lone wanderings, but mostly he filled her hours with sight-seeing. At Carson, Pirie's he bought her a nice skirt and shirt waist. With his money she purchased the little necessaries of toilet, until at last she looked quite another maiden. The mirror convinced her of a few things which she had long believed. She was pretty, yes, indeed! How nice her hat set, and weren't her eyes pretty. She caught her little red lip with her teeth and felt her first thrill of power. Drouet was so good.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每次见面都是这样。杜洛埃不来看她的时候很少。她有时候一个人单独逛逛，但是大多数时候他带着她到处观光。在卡生街的比尔公司，他给她买了条漂亮的裙子和一件宽松式上衣。她又用他的钱买了一些基本化妆品。到最后，她简直像换了一个人。镜子向她证实了她对自己的一向看法：她真是美，是的，美丽绝伦！帽子戴在她头上多俏丽，她的眼睛不也很美吗？她用牙齿咬咬自己的小红嘴唇，第一次为自己的魅力而吃惊兴奋。杜洛埃这人真好。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They went to see "The Mikado" one evening, an opera which was hilariously popular at that time. Before going, they made off for the Windsor dining-room, which was in Dearborn Street, a considerable distance from Carrie's room. It was blowing up cold, and out of her window Carrie could see the western sky, still pink with the fading light, but steely blue at the top where it met the darkness. A long, thin cloud of pink hung in midair, shaped like some island in a far-off sea. Somehow the swaying of some dead branches of trees across the way brought back the picture with which she was familiar when she looked from their front window in December days at home. She paused and wrung her little hands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天傍晚，他们一起去看“日本天皇”，这是一出当时很流行的歌剧。去看戏之前，他们先去温莎餐厅。那家餐馆在第邦街，离嘉莉的住处有一大段路。外面刮起了寒风，从她的窗子看出去，可以看到西边的天空上还残留着一抹淡红的晚霞，而在头顶上方，天空现出湛蓝的颜色，最后和暮色交融在一起。一长抹粉红色的薄云浮在半空，就像海上遥远的仙岛。路对面，光秃秃的树枝在风中摇曳。这景色让她想起了老家。12月份时从她们家的前窗看到的也是这种熟悉的景色。她停了下来，痛苦地扭动着她的小手。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They walked north on Wabash to Adams Street and then west. The lights in the stores were already shining out in gushes of golden hue. The arc lights were sputtering overhead, and high up were the lighted windows of the tall office buildings. The chill wind whipped in and out in gusty breaths. Homeward bound, the six o'clock throng bumped and jostled. Light overcoats were turned up about the ears, hats were pulled down. Little shop-girls went fluttering by in pairs and fours, chattering, laughing. It was a spectacle of warm-blooded humanity.</div>

<div class="line_en">They stopped in at a restaurant for a little after-theatre lunch. Just a shade of a thought of the hour entered Carrie's head, but there was no household law to govern her now. If any habits ever had time to fix upon her, they would have operated here. Habits are peculiar things. They will drive the really non-religious mind out of bed to say prayers that are only a custom and not a devotion. The victim of habit, when he has neglected the thing which it was his custom to do, feels a little scratching in the brain, a little irritating something which comes of being out of the rut, and imagines it to be the prick of conscience, the still, small voice that is urging him ever to righteousness. If the digression is unusual enough, the drag of habit will be heavy enough to cause the unreasoning victim to return and perform the perfunctory thing. "Now, bless me," says such a mind, "I have done my duty," when, as a matter of fact, it has merely done its old, unbreakable trick once again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="马车在一家餐馆门口停下来，他们进去吃宵夜。时间不早了，这个念头在嘉莉头脑里只是模糊地一闪而过，反正她现在已经不受家规的约束了。假如她以前曾有时间形成一定的习惯的话，在这种场合习惯会起作用。习惯真是样怪东西，它能驱使一个没有宗教信仰的人从床上爬起来做祷告，这种祷告完全是习惯使然，而非宗教热忱。受习惯支配的人，一旦忽略了平常做惯的事情，他的心里会产生某种不安，一种脱离日常轨道带来的烦恼和不快，于是他想象这是良心在责备他，想象他听到了良心的声音在轻轻地督促他走上正轨。如果他过份地偏离了常轨，习惯的力量会强大到使这不动脑筋只凭习惯行事的人又回到老习惯来，因循守例行事。“好了，老天保佑，”这种人会这么说，“我总算尽了责任，做了我该做的事。“而实际上，他不过又一次照根深蒂固的老习惯做事而已。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They had been dawdling over the dishes, and their eyes had frequently met. Carrie could not help but feel the vibration of force which followed, which, indeed, was his gaze. He had a way of touching her hand in explanation, as if to impress a fact upon her. He touched it now as he spoke of going.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吃饭时，他们一直在慢慢地消磨时间。他们的目光不时相接。嘉莉不觉感到他的目光中带有让她心跳的力量。他说话时喜欢用手碰碰她的手，好像要加深她的印象似的。现在当他说走时，他又碰了碰她的手。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They arose and went out into the street. The downtown section was now bare, save for a few whistling strollers, a few owl cars, a few open resorts whose windows were still bright. Out Wabash Avenue they strolled, Drouet still pouring forth his volume of small information. He had Carrie's arm in his, and held it closely as he explained. Once in a while, after some witticism, he would look down, and his eyes would meet hers. At last they came to the steps, and Carrie stood up on the first one, her head now coming even with his own. He took her hand and held it genially. He looked steadily at her as she glanced about, warmly musing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们站起来，走到外面街上。闹市区的行人已经寥寥无几，只有几个吹着口哨的闲逛者，几辆夜间行驶的街车，还有几家娱乐场仍开着门，亮着灯光。他们慢慢走着，出了华拔士街，杜洛埃滔滔不绝地说着那些趣事逸闻，他挽着嘉莉的手臂，说话时紧紧地握着。每隔一小会儿，说了什么俏皮话以后，他就低下头，和她目光相交。终于他们到了台阶边。嘉莉站在一级台阶上，她的头于是和他的头一样高了。他抓住她的手，温柔地握着，他久久地凝视着她，而她沉思地四下看看，心里一片温暖。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At about that hour, Minnie was soundly sleeping, after a long evening of troubled thought. She had her elbow in an awkward position under her side. The muscles so held irritated a few nerves, and now a vague scene floated in on the drowsy mind. She fancied she and Carrie were somewhere beside an old coal-mine. She could see the tall runway and the heap of earth and coal cast out. There was a deep pit, into which they were looking; they could see the curious wet stones far down where the wall disappeared in vague shadows. An old basket, used for descending, was hanging there, fastened by a worn rope.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在这大约同一时刻，经过长长一晚上的忧思，敏妮正在酣睡。她侧身睡着，胳膊肘很不舒服地压在身子下。受了压迫的肌肉刺激了神经，使得睡意正浓的脑海里浮现出一片模模糊糊的景象。她梦见她和嘉莉不知站在哪个旧矿井的旁边。她可以看到高高的滑槽和一堆堆挖出的泥土和煤。她们俩伸长脖子朝一个很深的竖井往下看。她们可以看到下面很深的地方，有些潮湿的怪石。那个地方的井壁已经看不清，只留下一些暗影。井口有一个用来载人上下的旧筐子，用一根已磨损的旧绳子吊在那里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Now the mystic scenery merged queerly and the place was by waters she had never seen. They were upon some board or ground or something that reached far out, and at the end of this was Carrie. They looked about, and now the thing was sinking, and Minnie heard the low sip of the encroaching water.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在，这神秘的幻影很奇怪地消失了。她发现来到了一片她从来没有去过的水边。她们正站在突出到水里去的某样东西上，那也许是一块木板，也许是伸入水中的陆地，也许是别的什么。嘉莉正站在这东西的顶端。她们四下张望，现在这东西开始往下沉，敏妮可以听到水漫上来的低低的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>
