<div class="line_en">The man looked at it, holding it carelessly between thumb and forefinger. He was bald except for long strands of black hair that grew from a former brow line, plastered sweatily down over the naked scalp. His underlip was thrust out with the contempt and negation that had fixed itself on his face as soon as Therese had come to the counter and spoken her first words.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那男人看了看，漫不经心地把东西捏在拇指和食指间。他的头秃了，只剩下一绺绺长长的黑发从以前的额线上长出来，他费力把头发贴着光秃秃的头皮梳平。特芮丝才刚走到柜台，说出第一句话，他就挤出下唇，露出轻蔑和不屑的样子。这种表情就这么固定在他脸上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Who were all the lucky people, she wondered, who had managed to sell their old pocketknives, broken wrist watches and carpenters' planes that hung in clumps in the front window? She could not resist looking back through the window, finding the man's face again under the row of hanging hunting knives. The man was looking at her, too, smiling at her. She felt he understood every move she made. Therese hurried down the sidewalk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她在想，是谁那么幸运，可以把橱窗里挂着的一堆陈旧的折叠小刀、破掉的腕表和木工刨子卖给当铺？她忍不住又往窗子里面看，在一排悬挂着的猎刀下找到那个男人的脸孔。那个男人也看着她，对着她笑。她觉得他好像了解自己的一举一动。特芮丝于是从人行道上快步离去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She hurried westward, ran across Lexington Avenue, then Park, and turned down Madison. She clutched the little box in her pocket until its sharp edges cut her fingers. Sister Beatrice had given it to her. It was inlaid brown wood and mother-of-pearl, in a checked pattern. She didn't know what it was worth in money, but she had assumed it was rather precious.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她快步往西走，奔跑着穿过莱克辛顿大道，然后是公园大道，再转往麦迪逊大道。她紧抓住口袋里的小盒子，直到盒子尖锐的边缘划破了手指为止。这个小盒子是比阿特丽丝修女送的，上面镶着褐色的木头，构成格子状的花纹。她不知道这东西值多少钱，只认为这个东西非常珍贵。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Therese left the shop with the receipt in her billfold. It wouldn't do to risk bringing the handbag into the store. It might be stolen, even if it was Christmas Eve. Therese smiled. It was her last day of work at the store. And in four more days came the job at the Black Cat. Phil was going to bring her a copy of the play the day after Christmas.</div>

<div class="line_en">An illustration in one of the counter displays caught her eye. It was a young knight on a white horse, riding through a bouquet-like forest, followed by a line of page boys, the last bearing a cushion with a gold ring on it. She took the leather-bound book in her hand. The price inside the cover was twenty-five dollars. If she simply went to the bank now and got twenty-five dollars more, she could buy it. What was twenty-five dollars? She hadn't needed to pawn the silver medallion. She knew she had pawned it only because it was from Richard, and she didn't want it any longer. She closed the book and looked at the edges of the pages that were like a concave bar of gold. But would Carol really like it, a book of love poems of the middle ages? She didn't know. She couldn't remember the slightest clue as to Carol's taste in books. She put the book down hurriedly and left.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="柜台陈列的一张插图吸引了她的目光。图中有个年轻的骑士骑着白马，骑过看起来像花束般的森林，后面跟着一排侍童，最后一个带着一个垫子，垫子上面放着一个金色戒指。她拿了那本有皮质书套的书，里面的标价写着二十五块钱。如果她现在就去银行再多领二十五块钱出来，就可以买这本书了。二十五元值多少呢？其实她没有必要把那根银链子当掉，她当了那个链子的原因，仅仅是因为那是理查德送的，她不想要再留着。她阖上书，看着书封面凹陷的边缘。卡罗尔喜不喜欢一本写着中世纪情诗的书？她也不知道。她记不起任何有关卡罗尔对书籍的品味的线索，于是匆忙放下书离开了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She passed Brentano's. Its window was full of satin ribbons, leather-bound books, and pictures of knights in armor. Therese turned back and went into the store, not to buy but to look, just for a moment, to see if there was anything here more beautiful than the handbag.</div>

<div class="line_en">Perhaps once Mrs. Zabriskie had been as happy as she. Perhaps it had gone away. She remembered reading -- even Richard once saying -- that love usually dies after two years of marriage. That, was a cruel thing, a trick. She tried to imagine Carol's face, the smell of her perfume, becoming meaningless. But in the first place could she say she was in love with Carol? She had come to a question she could not answer.</div>

They sat at the counter and ordered sandwiches and coffee, but Carol did not eat. Carol asked her questions about Richard, not in the concerned way she had Sunday afternoon, but rather as if she talked to keep Therese from asking more questions about her.

<div class="line_en">Therese stood by the kitchen table, watching them, feeling at ease because Abby paid no further attention to her, only took off her coat and started helping Carol with the coffee. Her waist and hips looked perfectly cylindrical, without any front or back, under her purple knitted suit. Her hands were a little clumsy, Therese noticed, and her feet had none of the grace of Carol's. She looked older than Carol, and there were two wrinkles across her forehead that cut deep when she laughed and her strong arched eyebrows rose higher. And she and Carol kept laughing now, while they fixed coffee and squeezed orange juice, talking in short phrases about nothing, or nothing that was important enough to be followed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特芮丝站在厨房桌子旁边看着她们。她觉得在这里倒很自在，艾比并没有特别注意她，只是脱掉外套帮卡罗尔煮咖啡。她的腰和臀部看起来是标准的圆筒形，在紫色毛衣底下看不出正面和背面的分别。特芮丝注意到她的手有点笨拙，她的脚也不像卡罗尔的脚那么优雅。她看起来比卡罗尔老，额头上有两道皱纹，笑起来皱纹显得更深，两道拱形的粗眉毛也提得更高。她和卡罗尔继续谈笑，煮好了咖啡又榨了点柳橙汁，有一句没一句地聊着不重要的事，或者说没什么重要到需要仔细听的事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The same," Carol said. Carol was looking for something in the refrigerator, and watching her, Therese failed to hear all of what Abby said next, or maybe it was another of the fragmentary sentences that Carol alone understood, but it made Carol straighten up and laugh, suddenly and hard, made her whole face change, and Therese thought with sudden envy, she could not make Carol laugh like that, but Abby could.</div>
