<div class="line_en">He dug his shovel into the dirt, then slowly turned to dump it into a pile. He had to make his turns smooth and slow. If he jerked too quickly, he felt a throbbing pain just above his neck where Zigzag's shovel had hit him.</div>

<div class="line_en">He was still the slowest digger, but not all that much slower than Magnet. Less than thirty minutes after Magnet returned to camp, Stanley spat into his hole.</div>

<div class="line_en">That part of his head, between his neck and ear, was considerably swollen. There were no mirrors in camp, but he imagined he looked like he had a hard-boiled egg sticking out of him.</div>

<div class="line_en">The next morning Mr. Sir marched the boys to another section of the lake, and each boy dug his own hole, five feet deep and five feet wide. Stanley was glad to be away from the big hole. At least now he knew just how much he had to dig for the day. And it was a relief not to have other shovels swinging past his face, or the Warden hanging around.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天早上，长官先生把男孩们带到翠湖的另外一块区域，孩子们又开始各自挖洞，每个洞都要五英尺深和五英尺宽。能够远离之前的那个大洞，斯坦利感到很开心。至少现在他知道一天得挖多少了。而且，其他人的铲子也不会在他面前晃来晃去，管理员大人也不会在上面转来转去，这一下，他感到轻松不少。">查看中文翻译</div>
