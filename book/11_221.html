<div class="line_en">The vision melted into waking; and there was Tom whistling like a tree-full of birds; and the sun was already slanting down the hill and through the open window. Outside everything was green and pale gold.</div>

<div class="line_en">That night they heard no noises. But either in his dreams or out of them, he could not tell which, Frodo heard a sweet singing running in his mind; a song that seemed to come like a pale light behind a grey rain-curtain, and growing stronger to turn the veil all to glass and silver, until at last it was rolled back, and a far green country opened before him under a swift sunrise.</div>

<div class="line_en">After breakfast, which they again ate alone, they made ready to say farewell, as nearly heavy of heart as was possible on such a morning: cool, bright, and clean under a washed autumn sky of thin blue. The air came fresh from the North-west. Their quiet ponies were almost frisky, sniffing and moving restlessly. Tom came out of the house and waved his hat and danced upon the doorstep, bidding the hobbits to get up and be off and go with good speed.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Goldberry!" he cried. "My fair lady, clad all in silver green! We have never said farewell to her, nor seen her since the evening!" He was so distressed that he turned back; but at that moment a clear call came rippling down. There on the hill-brow she stood beckoning to them: her hair was flying loose, and as it caught the sun it shone and shimmered. A light like the glint of water on dewy grass flashed from under her feet as she danced.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“金莓小姐！”他大喊着。“那位穿着一身银绿的美女，我们从昨天晚上以后就没见过她，更忘记和她道别了！”他沮丧的准备转头回去，就在那一刻，如银铃般的呼唤从山上传了下来。她正站在山脊上对他们挥着手：她的秀发飞舞，在陽光的照耀下闪闪发亮。当她移动步履的时候，脚下的草地似乎闪耀着洁净的露水。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They rode off along a path that wound away from behind the house, and went slanting up towards the north end of the hill-brow under which it sheltered. They had just dismounted to lead their ponies up the last steep slope, when suddenly Frodo stopped.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一行人骑着马，沿着屋后的小径往山丘的北边山脊前进。正当众人牵着马匹准备越过最后一道斜坡时，佛罗多突然停下了脚步。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They hastened up the last slope, and stood breathless beside her. They bowed, but with a wave of her arm she bade them look round; and they looked out from the hill-top over lands under the morning. It was now as clear and far-seen as it had been veiled and misty when they stood upon the knoll in the Forest, which could now be seen rising pale and green out of the dark trees in the West. In that direction the land rose in wooded ridges, green, yellow, russet under the sun, beyond which lay hidden the valley of the Brandywine. To the South, over the line of the Withywindle, there was a distant glint like pale glass where the Brandywine River made a great loop in the lowlands and flowed away out of the knowledge of the hobbits. Northward beyond the dwindling downs the land ran away in flats and swellings of grey and green and pale earth-colours, until it faded into a featureless and shadowy distance. Eastward the Barrow-downs rose, ridge behind ridge into the morning, and vanished out of eyesight into a guess: it was no more than a guess of blue and a remote white glimmer blending with the hem of the sky, but it spoke to them, out of memory and old tales, of the high and distant mountains.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="众人匆匆爬上最后一道斜坡，气喘吁吁的站在她身边。他们向女主人鞠躬道别，她双手一摆，示意他们看着眼前晨光下的景象。之前被笼罩在浓雾层层面纱中的森林现在也卸下了伪装，展现出它的真面目。西边的大地长满了各式各样的树木，在陽光下显得蓬勃繁盛，烈酒河河谷则是隐身在这浓密的森林后。往南方看去，在越过柳条河后，烈酒河转了个大弯，绕过一块低地，流出哈比人的疆域之外。北边则是一望无际的丘陵起伏，青绿和褐色的区块交杂其间，一直绵延到极目所及的天边。东边则是连绵不断的古墓岗，阻挡了所有的视线。众人勉力望去，只能看见天际一片白茫茫的影像流转，远古的传说对他们述说着遥远彼端的高山峻岭。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Goldberry spoke to them and recalled their eyes and thoughts. "Speed now, fair guests!" she said. "And hold to your purpose! North with the wind in the left eye and a blessing on your footsteps! Make haste while the Sun shines!" And to Frodo she said: "Farewell, Elf-friend, it was a merry meeting!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="金莓开口唤回他们的注意力。“快走吧，可爱的客人！”她说。“朝你们的目标前进。朝北走，让风一直吹在你的左眼，定可以顺利的前进！趁着天色还亮的时候赶快赶路！”她接着对佛罗多说：“再会了，精灵之友，很高兴能和你见面！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They took a deep draught of the air, and felt that a skip and a few stout strides would bear them wherever they wished. It seemed fainthearted to go jogging aside over the crumpled skirts of the downs towards the Road, when they should be leaping, as lusty as Tom, over the stepping stones of the hills straight towards the Mountains.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们深深吸了一口气，起了一种彷佛腾云驾雾，可以去到任何地方的错觉。即使是沿着古墓岗一路慢跑到东方大道上也显得轻松无比，他们甚至认为该模仿汤姆一样蹦蹦跳跳的一路冲向远方的高山。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But Frodo found no words to answer. He bowed low, and mounted his pony, and followed by his friends jogged slowly down the gentle slope behind the hill. Tom Bombadil's house and the valley, and the Forest were lost to view. The air grew warmer between the green walls of hillside and hillside, and the scent of turf rose strong and sweet as they breathed. Turning back, when they reached the bottom of the green hollow, they saw Goldberry, now small and slender like a sunlit flower against the sky: she was standing still watching them, and her hands were stretched out towards them. As they looked she gave a clear call, and lifting up her hand she turned and vanished behind the hill.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="张口结舌的佛罗多说不出话来。他深深一鞠躬，骑上小马，和朋友们一起策马步下眼前平缓的斜坡。慢慢的，汤姆的屋子、山谷以及整座森林都消失在视线以外。在两边青绿山丘所构成的高墙之间，空气渐渐变得温暖起来，怡人的青草气味也毫不吝惜的飘汤在风中。当他们走到山谷底时，回头看见金莓的身影。她小小的身影看来像是陽光下的一朵小白花。她对着他们伸出双手送行。接着，她最后的道别声随着秋风传来，在众人的目送之下，金莓转身消失在山丘后。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Their way wound along the floor of the hollow, and round the green feet of a steep hill into another deeper and broader valley, and then over the shoulder of further hills, and down their long limbs, and up their smooth sides again, up on to new hill-tops and down into new valleys. There was no tree nor any visible water: it was a country of grass and short springy turf, silent except for the whisper of the air over the edges of the land, and high lonely cries of strange birds. As they journeyed the sun mounted, and grew hot. Each time they climbed a ridge the breeze seemed to have grown less. When they caught a glimpse of the country westward the distant Forest seemed to be smoking, as if the fallen rain was steaming up again from leaf and root and mould. A shadow now lay round the edge of sight, a dark haze above which the upper sky was like a blue cap, hot and heavy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们沿着谷底曲折的道路不停前进，绕过一个陡峭的山丘，进入另一个较为宽广的山谷。接着他们又越过更远处的山丘，爬上山坡，在谷地和丘陵之间上上下下的奔波。眼前没有任何的树木或溪流：这是个遍地青草的乡间，唯一的声响来自于微风的吹拂和孤鸟的鸣叫。太陽越升越高，温度也开始跟着爬升。他们每爬上一座山丘，凉风似乎就越来越少。远方的森林这时冒出冉冉的蒸汽，好像正在把之前的大雨吐回天际一样。极目所及的天空一片晴朗，只有远方有着些许的云朵。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">About mid-day they came to a hill whose top was wide and flattened, like a shallow saucer with a green mounded rim. Inside there was no air stirring, and the sky seemed near their heads. They rode across and looked northwards. Then their hearts rose, for it seemed plain that they had come further already than they had expected. Certainly the distances had now all become hazy and deceptive, but there could be no doubt that the Downs were coming to an end. A long valley lay below them winding away northwards, until it came to an opening between two steep shoulders. Beyond, there seemed to be no more hills. Due north they faintly glimpsed a long dark line. That is a line of trees," said Merry, "and that must mark the Road. All along it for many leagues east of the Bridge there are trees growing. Some say they were planted in the old days."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在中午不久，他们来到了一座有着平坦山顶的小丘。丘顶有点类似镶着绿边的浅碟。浅碟内一点风也没有，毒辣的太陽更直射其中。他们被迫只得站在碟缘，往北边打量距离。他们这才发现这次的跋涉比预期的要顺利许多；虽然远处的景色在酷热的太陽照耀下反而显得有些模糊，但他们依旧看出这连绵的丘陵已经快要结束了。他们脚下是一座细长的山谷，一路穿过两座陡峭的山丘，最后来到一块宽阔的平原。在平原之外就没有任何的地势起伏了。再往更北边看去，他们可以依稀看见一条长长的黑线。“那应该是一排树，”梅里说，“一定就是东方大道了。从烈酒桥往东一路走去，有好几十哩路旁都长满了树。有些人说那是古代人们留下的痕迹。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That view was somehow disquieting; so they turned from the sight and went down into the hollow circle. In the midst of it there stood a single stone, standing tall under the sun above, and at this hour casting no shadow. It was shapeless and yet significant: like a landmark, or a guarding finger, or more like a warning. But they were now hungry, and the sun was still at the fearless noon; so they set their backs against the east side of the stone. It was cool, as if the sun had had no power to warm it; but at that time this seemed pleasant. There they took food and drink, and made as good a noon-meal under the open sky as anyone could wish; for the food came from "down under Hill". Tom had provided them with plenty for the comfort of the day. Their ponies unburdened strayed upon the grass.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这景象不知为何让人感到不安，他们刻意避开它，走回洼地的中心。那里矗立着一块高耸的岩石，在直射的烈日底下没有投射出任何的陰影。虽然那块岩石的形状并不特殊，但它所处的位置却让人很难忽略它。它像是个地标，或是个守卫，更像根警告的手指。不过，众人肚子都饿了，现在也还是日正当中的时刻，应该没什么好害怕的。因此一行人卸下背包靠着岩石东面放好。岩石的表面有些冰凉，彷佛连太陽都无力温暖它；在这时，大家还觉得这是个不错的好运。他们拿出食物和饮水，在烈日之下大吃大嚼，尽情享受山下带来的午餐。汤姆慷慨的送给他们很多食物，让他们今天可以没有后顾之忧的填饱肚子。卸下重担的小马则是在草地上悠闲的啃着青草。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Splendid!" said Frodo. "If we make as good going this afternoon as we have done this morning, we shall have left the Downs before the Sun sets and be jogging on in search of a camping place." But even as he spoke he turned his glance eastwards, and he saw that on that side the hills were higher and looked down upon them; and all those hills were crowned with green mounds, and on some were standing stones, pointing upwards like jagged teeth out of green gums.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“太好了！”佛罗多说。“如果我们下午的进度能和早上一样顺利，那么天黑前就可以离开这丘陵区，可以开始寻找适合宿营的地点了。”话虽这样说，他还是忍不住往东方看去。那边的山丘都远比这边高的多，用着有敌意的态度俯视着他们。那些山丘顶上都有着绿色的圆丘，有些还有竖立的岩石，像是从绿色牙龈中伸出的参差利齿。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Riding over the hills, and eating their fill, the warm sun and the scent of turf, lying a little too long, stretching out their legs and looking at the sky above their noses: these things are, perhaps, enough to explain what happened. However, that may be: they woke suddenly and uncomfortably from a sleep they had never meant to take.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在山丘间跋涉了一上午之后，饱餐一顿，再加上暖洋洋的日光和青草的芬芳催化，大家放松了心情，伸出小脚，看着蔚蓝的天空。接下来发生的事情似乎是很自然的：他们睡着了。四个人不约而同的从这意外的午睡中不安的醒来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The standing stone was cold, and it cast a long pale shadow that stretched eastward over them. The sun, a pale and watery yellow, was gleaming through the mist just above the west wall of the hollow in which they lay; north, south, and east, beyond the wall the fog was thick, cold and white. The air was silent, heavy and chill. Their ponies were standing crowded together with their heads down.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那块岩石依旧冰冷，朝向东方投射出懒洋洋的影子。快要落到浅碟边的太陽在渐起的大雾中显得有气无力。冰冷、厚重的白雾将整个山顶包围起来，四周弥漫着沉重的气氛，毫无声响的荒野更让人内心不安。原先生气勃勃的小马现在都聚拢在一起，头低低的不敢动弹。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The hobbits sprang to their feet in alarm, and ran to the western rim. They found that they were upon an island in the fog. Even as they looked out in dismay towards the setting sun, it sank before their eyes into a white sea, and a cold grey shadow sprang up in the East behind. The fog rolled up to the walls and rose above them, and as it mounted it bent over their heads until it became a roof: they were shut in a hall of mist whose central pillar was the standing stone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈比人们警觉的跳了起来，跑向西边打探状况。众人这才发现自己彷佛被困在迷雾之海中的孤岛上。不知如何是好的哈比人束手无策的看着太陽落入雾海之中，东方也跟着窜出诡异的灰色陰影。浓雾溢过浅碟边，滚到他们头上，把众人包围在一个以石柱为顶的封闭领域中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Soon they were leading their ponies in single file over the rim and down the long northward slope of the hill, down into a foggy sea. As they went down the mist became colder and damper, and their hair hung lank and dripping on their foreheads. When they reached the bottom it was so cold that they halted and got out cloaks and hoods, which soon became bedewed with grey drops. Then, mounting their ponies, they went slowly on again, feeling their way by the rise and fall of the ground. They were steering, as well as they could guess, for the gate-like opening at the far northward end of the long valley which they had seen in the morning. Once they were through the gap, they had only lo keep on in anything like a straight line and they were bound in the end to strike the Road. Their thoughts did not go beyond that, except for a vague hope that perhaps away beyond the Downs there might be no fog.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="很快的，他们就牵着小马一个接一个的越过浅碟边缘，朝北走下斜坡，踏进雾海之中。随着他们的深入，四周的雾气变得越来越湿、越来越冷。每个人的头发都贴在前额上，不住的滴水。当他们终于来到谷底时，天气已经冷的让他们不得不拿出连帽斗篷穿上。不久之后，连斗篷都因为吸了太多雾气而开始不停滴水。最后，他们骑上马，靠着地势的起伏判断方向，开始缓慢前进。他们试图摸索着走到之前所看到通往平原的隘口。一旦他们通过了那隘口，就只需要直直朝北走，终究会走上东方大道的。他们不敢再多想之后的行程，只能抱着微薄的希望暗自祈祷丘陵区之外不要再有浓雾。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They felt as if a trap was closing about them; but they did not quite lose heart. They still remembered the hopeful view they had had of the line of the Road ahead, and they still knew in which direction it lay. In any case, they now had so great a dislike for that hollow place about the stone that no thought of remaining there was in their minds. They packed up as quickly as their chilled fingers would work.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们觉得好像有个陷阱正在悄悄收拢，但这景象并不足以让他们灰心。他们还记得之前看到的路况，也还知道该往那个方向走。事实上，这个地方开始让他们觉得毛骨悚然，根本不想要多停留一分一秒。众人用快要冻僵的手指飞快的收拾行李，准备离开。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Come on! Follow me!" he called back over his shoulder, and he hurried forward. But his hope soon changed to bewilderment and alarm. The dark patches grew darker, but they shrank; and suddenly he saw, towering ominous before him and leaning slightly towards one another like the pillars of a headless door, two huge standing stones. He could not remember having seen any sign of these in the valley, when he looked out from the hill in the morning. He had passed between them almost before he was aware: and even as he did so darkness seemed to fall round him. His pony reared and snorted, and he fell off. When he looked back he found that he was alone: the others had not followed him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“快！跟我来！”他回头大喊，边策马向前奔驰。可是，他满腔的希望瞬即化成了泡影。眼前的黑影开始渐渐清晰，但却不是他所想像的出口。两根微微弯曲的高大石柱构成了一个没有门廊的黑暗大门。他不记得曾经从高处看到任何类似的景色。在他来得及仔细思索之前，他就已经越过了这两根石柱，无边无际的黑暗开始将他淹没。他的座骑不住的后退，发出惊慌的嘶叫声。佛罗多一个不稳，从马上落了下来。他随即打量着四周，却找不到其他人的踪影。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Their going was very slow. To prevent their getting separated and wandering in different directions they went in file, with Frodo leading. Sam was behind him, and after him came Pippin, and then Merry. The valley seemed to stretch on endlessly. Suddenly Frodo saw a hopeful sign. On either side ahead a darkness began to loom through the mist; and he guessed that they were at last approaching the gap in the hills, the north-gate of the Barrow-downs. If they could pass that, they would be free.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们行进的速度极为缓慢。为了避免在大雾中迷途，佛罗多领着一行人列队往前走。山姆走在他后面，在那之后是皮聘，然后是梅里。山谷似乎无尽的往前延伸，永远也走不完。突然间，佛罗多看到了一丝希望。道路两旁的山势开始穿破浓雾，缓缓上升。他猜测这应该就是之前苦苦盼望的隘口，也就是古墓岗的北边出口。只要走出这个隘口，他们就可以放心的休息。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was no answer. Fear took him, and he ran back past the stones shouting wildly: "Sam! Sam! Merry! Pippin!" The pony bolted into the mist and vanished. From some way off, or so it seemed, he thought he heard a cry: "Hoy! Frodo! Hoy!" It was away eastward, on his left as he stood under the great stones, staring and straining into the gloom. He plunged off in the direction of the call, and found himself going steeply uphill.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="四周没有任何的回音。他开始感到恐惧，在巨大的岩石间奔跑，边狂乱的喊叫着：“山姆！山姆！梅里！皮聘！”小马拔腿奔进迷雾中，就此消失。他觉得似乎从一段距离之外传来了：“嘿！佛罗多！喂！”的叫声。那声音来自东方，他着急的站在岩石间，试图搞清楚自己的方向。一确定那声音是在左边之后，他立刻拔足狂奔，冲上一座十分陡峭的山坡。">查看中文翻译</div>

He stumbled forward with all the speed he could towards the cries; but the light was now gone, and clinging night had closed about him, so that it was impossible to be sure of any direction. He seemed all the time to be climbing up and up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他一边奔跑，一边扯开嗓门大喊。有很长的一段时间没有任何回应，当微弱的回音再度出现时，似乎是来自更高更远的地方。“佛罗多！喂！”那微弱的声音穿越迷雾飘过来。突然，“救命！救命！”的喊声取代了之前的话声，最后一声拖长的的“救命！”十分凄厉的嘎然而止。佛罗多立刻使尽全身力气奔向那惨叫的源头；可是，原先微弱的光线已经消失了，墨黑的夜色将他紧紧包围，根本完全无法分辨方向。他只知道自己一直不停的往上爬。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He imagined suddenly that he caught a muffled cry, and he made towards it; and even as he went forward the mist was rolled up and thrust aside, and the starry sky was unveiled. A glance showed him that he was now facing southwards and was on a round hill-top, which he must have climbed from the north. Out of the east the biting wind was blowing. To his right there loomed against the westward stars a dark black shape. A great barrow stood there.</div>

<div class="line_en">As he lay there, thinking and getting a hold of himself, he noticed all at once that the darkness was slowly giving way: a pale greenish light was growing round him. It did not at first show him what kind of a place he was in, for the light seemed to be coming out of himself, and from the floor beside him, and had not yet reached the roof or wall. He turned, and there in the cold glow he saw lying beside him Sam, Pippin, and Merry. They were on their backs, and their faces looked deathly pale; and they were clad in white. About them lay many treasures, of gold maybe, though in that light they looked cold and unlovely. On their heads were circlets, gold chains were about their waists, and on their fingers were many rings. Swords lay by their sides, and shields were at their feet. But across their three necks lay one long naked sword.</div>

<div class="line_en">Suddenly a song began: a cold murmur, rising and falling. The voice seemed far away and immeasurably dreary, sometimes high in the air and thin, sometimes like a low moan from the ground. Out of the formless stream of sad but horrible sounds, strings of words would now and again shape themselves: grim, hard, cold words, heartless and miserable. The night was railing against the morning of which it was bereaved, and the cold was cursing the warmth for which it hungered. Frodo was chilled to the marrow. After a while the song became clearer, and with dread in his heart he perceived that it had changed into an incantation:</div>

<div class="line_en">But the courage that had been awakened in him was now too strong: he could not leave his friends so easily. He wavered, groping in his pocket, and then fought with himself again; and as he did so the arm crept nearer. Suddenly resolve hardened in him, and he seized a short sword that lay beside him, and kneeling he stooped low over the bodies of his companions. With what strength he had he hewed at the crawling arm near the wrist, and the hand broke off; but at the same moment the sword splintered up to the hilt. There was a shriek and the light vanished. In the dark there was a snarling noise.</div>

<div class="line_en">The air was growing very warm again. The hobbits ran about for a while on the grass, as he told them. Then they lay basking in the sun with the delight of those that have been wafted suddenly from bitter winter to a friendly clime, or of people that, after being long ill and bedridden, wake one day to find that they are unexpectedly well and the day is again full of promise.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="气温又再度回升了。哈比人们照着汤姆说的，在草地上赤身裸体的跑了一阵子。然后，他们好像久旱逢甘霖的一样享受着温暖的陽光。又彷佛卧床已久的病人突然间摆脱疾病的纠缠一样满心欢喜。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So he sang, running fast, tossing up his hat and catching it, until he was hidden by a fold of the ground: but for some time his hey now! hoy now! came floating back down the wind, which had shifted round towards the south.</div>

<div class="line_en">By the time that Tom returned they were feeling strong (and hungry). He reappeared, hat first, over the brow of the hill, and behind him came in an obedient line six ponies: their own five and one more. The last was plainly old Fatty Lumpkin: he was larger, stronger, fatter (and older) than their own ponies. Merry, to whom the others belonged, had not, in fact, given them any such names, but they answered to the new names that Tom had given them for the rest of their lives. Tom called them one by one and they climbed over the brow and stood in a line. Then Tom bowed to the hobbits.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Here are your ponies, now!" he said. "They've more sense (in some ways) than you wandering hobbits have -- more sense in their noses. For they sniff danger ahead which you walk right into; and if they run to save themselves, then they run the right way. You must forgive them all; for though their hearts are faithful, to face fear of Barrow-wights is not what they were made for. See, here they come again, bringing all their burdens!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这就是各位的马儿啦！”他说。“从某个角度来看，它们比你们这些爱乱跑的哈比人聪明多了，至少它们鼻子够灵，知道哪些地方不该去。即使它们转身逃跑，方向也是非常正确的。它们虽然很忠心，但古墓尸妖的威胁并不是它们能对付的；你们应该要原谅它们。你看，它们又驼着所有的行李回来啦！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He's mine," said Tom. "My four-legged friend; though I seldom ride him, and he wanders often far, free upon the hillsides. When your ponies stayed with me, they got to know my Lumpkin; and they smelt him in the night, and quickly ran to meet him. I thought he'd look for them and with his words of wisdom take all their fear away. But now, my jolly Lumpkin, old Tom's going to ride. Hey! he's coming with you, just to set you on the road; so he needs a pony. For you cannot easily talk to hobbits that are riding, when you're on your own legs trying to trot beside them."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“它是我的马，”汤姆说。“是我四条腿的朋友，只是我平常很少骑它，任它在山野间乱跑。当你们的小马住进我的马厩时，它们一定记住了胖乡巴佬的味道；因此，它们在半夜就冲着那味道跑，最后遇上了我家的乡巴佬。我想它应该用它的智慧好好安抚了这些可怜的小马，让它们不再害怕。喔，对了，自由的乡巴佬，汤姆这次要骑你了啦。嘿！在下准备送你们一程，所以得有匹座骑才行。如果我要迈开大步赶路，就很难跟骑马的哈比人聊天罗！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was still fairly early by the sun, something between nine and ten, and the hobbits turned their minds to food. Their last meal had been lunch beside the standing stone the day before. They breakfasted now off the remainder of Tom's provisions, meant for their supper, with additions that Tom had brought with him. It was not a large meal (considering hobbits and the circumstances), but they felt much better for it. While they were eating Tom went up to the mound, and looked through the treasures. Most of these he made into a pile that glistened and sparkled on the grass. He bade them lie there "free to all finders, birds, beasts. Elves or Men, and all kindly creatures"; for so the spell of the mound should be broken and scattered and no Wight ever come back to it. He chose for himself from the pile a brooch set with blue stones, many-shaded like flax-flowers or the wings of blue butterflies. He looked long at it, as if stirred by some memory, shaking his head, and saying at last:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从太陽的角度来判断，现在的时间还算早，大概是九点到十点之间。刚刚才历险余生的哈比人又把脑筋动到食物上头去了。他们上一餐是在那块冰冷的石柱旁边吃的午餐，算来已经过了很久了。四人狼吞虎咽的把汤姆送给他们当晚餐的干粮吃光，同时也把汤姆刚刚额外带来的食物一扫而空。这顿饭并不算丰盛（哈比人的食量惊人，况且又好几餐没吃了），但至少让他们感觉好多了。在他们用餐的时候，汤姆跑到山头上，仔细检查拿出来的珠宝。他将大部分的珠宝拨成一堆，让它们在草地上闪闪发亮。他宣布要让这些宝物“属于下个发现它们的生灵”，不管是鸟兽、精灵或人类。因为唯有如此，这墓穴的诅咒才会被破坏，不会再有尸妖重回此地。他从里面挑出了一个镶有蓝宝石的胸针，那宝石拥有百变多端的美丽蓝影，一时间让人为之目眩。他仔细的打量了这胸针很久，彷佛想起过去一些回忆。最后，他摇摇头，开口道：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The hobbits were delighted to hear this, and thanked Tom many times; but he laughed, and said that they were so good at losing themselves that he would not feel happy till he had seen them safe over the borders of his land. "I've got things to do," he said: "my making and my singing, my talking and my walking, and my watching of the country. Tom can't be always near to open doors and willow-cracks. Tom has his house to mind, and Goldberry is waiting."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大家知道这件事之后都觉得很高兴，忙不迭的向汤姆道谢。不过，他笑着回答众人：这是因为他们实在太会迷路了，如果他不送大家到他的辖区边界去，他可能会担心的。“我还有很多事情要忙，”他说。“我要唱歌要跳舞、要聊天要走路，还要照管这块荒野。汤姆不能总是靠近墓穴大门或是柳树的缝隙。汤姆还有家要照顾，金莓还在等我哪。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For each of the hobbits he chose a dagger, long, leaf-shaped, and keen, of marvellous workmanship, damasked with serpent-forms in red and gold. They gleamed as he drew them from their black sheaths, wrought of some strange metal, light and strong, and set with many fiery stones. Whether by some virtue in these sheaths or because of the spell that lay on the mound, the blades seemed untouched by time, unrusted, sharp, glittering in the sun.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他替每名哈比人挑了一柄长型的宽阔匕首。这些武器十分的锐利，作工极为精细，上面还雕刻着红色与金色的巨蛇图案。当汤姆把这些兵器从黑色剑鞘中抽出时，用奇异金属打造的刀刃隐隐生光。这几柄匕首质硬而轻，上面还镶嵌着许多闪亮的宝石。不知道是由于这些剑鞘的保护还是古墓的诅咒，每一柄匕首都锐利、闪耀如昔，完全没有受到时光的侵蚀。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At last they set off. They led their ponies down the hill; and then mounting they trotted quickly along the valley. They looked back and saw the top of the old mound on the hill, and from it the sunlight on the gold went up like a yellow flame. Then they turned a shoulder of the Downs and it was hidden from view.</div>

<div class="line_en">The hobbits did not understand his words, but as he spoke they had a vision as it were of a great expanse of years behind them, like a vast shadowy plain over which there strode shapes of Men, tall and grim with bright swords, and last came one with a star on his brow. Then the vision faded, and they were back in the sunlit world. It was time to start again. They made ready, packing their bags and lading their ponies. Their new weapons they hung on their leather belts under their jackets, feeling them very awkward, and wondering if they would be of any use. Fighting had not before occurred to any of them as one of the adventures in which their flight would land them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈比人并不了解他所说的话，但他们脑中突然浮现一个来自遥远未来的影像：一块广大的平原上有许多人类行走着，每个人都十分高大、神情严肃，拿着锋利的宝剑，走在最后的是一名眉毛上有颗星星的男子。然后，那影像就消失了，他们又回到太陽照耀下的真实世界。该是出发的时候了。他们收拾好一切，打包行李、将它们绑在马匹身上。刚拿到的新武器挂在他们外套下的皮带上，让他们觉得有些笨拙，也怀疑这样的东西到底是否能派上用场。他们之前从来没想过这场逃亡会跟任何战斗牵扯上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Though Frodo looked about him on every side he saw no sign of the great stones standing like a gate, and before long they came to the northern gap and rode swiftly through, and the land fell away before them. It was a merry journey with Tom Bombadil trotting gaily beside them, or before them, on Fatty Lumpkin, who could move much faster than his girth promised. Tom sang most of the time, but it was chiefly nonsense, or else perhaps a strange language unknown to the hobbits, an ancient language whose words were mainly those of wonder and delight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不管佛罗多怎么仔细的寻找，就是找不到之前所看到的巨大石柱和它所构成的大门。过不了多久，他们就通过了隘口，离开了这块陰气森森的地方。有汤姆—庞巴迪的陪伴，这是段相当愉快的旅程。不过，乡巴佬的脚程比其它的马快得多，刚好可以让汤姆如常的在他们四周绕来绕去。汤姆大半时间都在唱着随口胡诌的小调，哈比人一个字也听不懂。也有可能这并不是汤姆胡诌的语言，而是一个古老，只适合描述快乐和美景的奇异语言。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They went forward steadily, but they soon saw that the Road was further away than they had imagined. Even without a fog, their sleep at mid-day would have prevented them from reaching it until after nightfall on the day before. The dark line they had seen was not a line of trees but a line of bushes growing on the edge of a deep dike with a steep wall on the further side. Tom said that it had once been the boundary of a kingdom, but a very long lime ago. He seemed to remember something sad about it, and would not say much.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们马不停蹄的赶路，却发现东方大道比他们所想像的远多了。即使没有大雾的阻挡，他们也无法拨空睡午觉；因为这样一来就铁定无法在天黑前赶到东方大道。他们之前看到的黑线并非是什么大树，而是深沟旁所生长的一连串灌木丛，在深沟的另一边则是一堵高墙。汤姆说这曾经是某个王国的边界，但那已经是很久以前的事了。他似乎记得一些有关他们的悲剧，但不愿意多谈。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They climbed down and out of the dike and through a gap in the wall, and then Tom turned due north, for they had been bearing somewhat to the west. The land was now open and fairly level, and they quickened their pace, but the sun was already sinking low when at last they saw a line of tall trees ahead, and they knew that they had come back to the Road after many unexpected adventures. They galloped their ponies over the last furlongs, and halted under the long shadows of the trees. They were on the top of a sloping bank, and the Road, now dim as evening drew on, wound away below them. At this point it ran nearly from South-west to North-east, and on their right it fell quickly down into a wide hollow. It was rutted and bore many signs of the recent heavy rain; there were pools and pot-holes full of water.</div>
