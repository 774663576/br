<div class="line_en">The hill loomed larger down here. Dany had taken to calling it Drag-onstone, after the ancient citadel where she'd been born. She had no memories of that Dragonstone, but she would not soon forget this one. Scrub grass and thorny bushes covered its lower slopes; higher up a jagged tangle of bare rock thrust steep and sudden into the sky. There, amidst broken boulders, razor-sharp ridges, and needle spires, Drogon made his lair inside a shallow cave. He had dwelt there for some time, Dany had realized when she first saw the hill. The air smelled of ash, every rock and tree in sight was scorched and blackened, the ground strewn with burned and broken bones, yet it had been home to him.</div>

<div class="line_en">It took Dany half the morning to climb down. By the time she reached the bottom she was winded. Her muscles ached, and she felt as if she had the beginnings of a fever. The rocks had scraped her hands raw. They are better than they were, though, she decided as she picked at a broken blister. Her skin was pink and tender, and a pale milky fluid was leaking from her cracked palms, but her burns were healing.</div>

<div class="line_en">Two days ago, climbing on a spire of rock, she had spied water to the south, a slender thread that glittered briefly as the sun was going down. A stream, Dany decided. Small, but it would lead her to a larger stream, and that stream would flow into some little river, and all the rivers in this part of the world were vassals of the Skahazadhan. Once she found the Skahazadhan she need only follow it downstream to Slaver's Bay.</div>

<div class="line_en">The dragonlords of old Valyria had controlled their mounts with binding spells and sorcerous horns. Daenerys made do with a word and a whip. Mounted on the dragon's back, she oft felt as if she were learning to ride all over again. When she whipped her silver mare on her right flank the mare went left, for a horse's first instinct is to flee from danger. When she laid the whip across Drogon's right side he veered right, for a dragon's first instinct is always to attack. Sometimes it did not seem to matter where she struck him, though; sometimes he went where he would and took her with him. Neither whip nor words could turn Drogon if he did not wish to be turned. The whip annoyed him more than it hurt him, she had come to see; his scales had grown harder than horn.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="古瓦雷利亚的龙骑士靠的是强大的咒语和带法力的号角来控制自己的坐骑。而丹妮莉丝用的是一个词和一条鞭子。骑在龙背上，她常有种再次初学骑乘的感觉。当她鞭打自己银母马的右肋时，母马便向左奔去，因为马匹的第一本能是远离危险。而当她的鞭子落在卓耿的右侧时，他却转向右方，因为龙的天性便是进攻。然而，有时她鞭打哪里似乎都没有关系，有些时候他会按照自己的意愿载着她飞行。要是他不愿意，无论用鞭子或者语言都无法让卓耿转向。鞭子对他造成的愤怒远比伤害要多，她已经意识到；他的龙鳞已经变得比牛角还要坚硬。">查看中文翻译</div>

Rivers running bright and blue below, glimmering in the sun. Will I ever see such sights again? On Drogon's back she felt whole. Up in the sky the woes of this world could not touch her.

<div class="line_en">The sun was hot this morning, the sky blue and cloudless. That was good. Dany's clothes were hardly more than rags, and offered little in the way of warmth. One of her sandals had slipped off during her wild flight from Meereen and she had left the other up by Drogon's cave, preferring to go barefoot rather than half-shod. Her tokar and veils she had abandoned in the pit, and her linen undertunic had never been made to withstand the hot days and cold nights of the Dothraki sea. Sweat and grass and dirt had stained it, and Dany had torn a strip off the hem to make a bandage for her shin. I must look a ragged thing, and starved, she thought, but if the days stay warm, I will not freeze.</div>

<div class="line_en">She was hungry too. One morning she had found some wild onions growing halfway down the south slope, and later that same day a leafy reddish vegetable that might have been some queer sort of cabbage. Whatever it was, it had not made her sick. Aside from that, and one fish that she had caught in the spring-fed pool outside of Drogon's cave, she had survived as best she could on the dragon's leavings, on burned bones and chunks of smoking meat, half-charred and half-raw. She needed more, she knew. One day she kicked at a cracked sheep's skull with the side of a bare foot and sent it bouncing over the edge of the hill. And as she watched it tumble down the steep slope toward the sea of grass, she realized she must follow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而且她也很饥饿。有一天早上她在南山坡下发现了一些野生洋葱，后来又发现了一颗长满淡红色叶子的蔬菜，看起来像是某种卷心菜的变种。是什么都不要紧，因为她吃了之后并没有身体不适。除此之外，她还从卓耿巢穴外涌泉形成的小池塘里抓到了一条鱼。她尽力靠龙吃剩的东西来填肚子，吃那些烧焦的骨头和大块的焦肉，咬起来一半是炭一半是生的。她知道自己需要更多食物。某天她赤足把一个裂掉的羊头骨踢了出去，一直顺着山丘的边缘滚了下去。当她看着它顺着斜坡翻滚进草海时，她意识到自己必须跟着走。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dany set off through the tall grass at a brisk pace. The earth felt warm between her toes. The grass was as tall as she was. It never seemed so high when I was mounted on my silver, riding beside my sun-and-stars at the head of his khalasar. As she walked, she tapped her thigh with the pitmaster's whip.

<div class="line_en">Daenerys Targaryen was no stranger to the Dothraki sea, the great ocean of grass that stretched from the forest of Qohor to the Mother of Mountains and the Womb of the World. She had seen it first when she was still a girl, newly wed to Khal Drogo and on her way to Vaes Dothrak to be presented to the crones of the dosh khaleen. The sight of all that grass stretching out before her had taken her breath away. The sky was blue, the grass was green, and I was full of hope. Ser Jorah had been with her then, her gruff old bear. She'd had Irri and Jhiqui and Doreah to care for her, her sun-and-stars to hold her in the night, his child growing inside her. Rhaego. I was going to name him Rhaego, and the dosh khaleen said he would be the Stallion Who Mounts the World. Not since those half-remembered days in Braavos when she lived in the house with the red door had she been as happy.</div>

<div class="line_en">But in the Red Waste, all her joy had turned to ashes. Her sun-and-stars had fallen from his horse, the maegi Mirri Maz Duur had murdered Rhaego in her womb, and Dany had smothered the empty shell of Khal Drogo with her own two hands. Afterward Drogo's great khalasar had shattered. Ko Pono named himself Khal Pono and took many riders with him, and many slaves as well. Ko Jhaqo named himself Khal Jhaqo and rode off with even more. Mago, his bloodrider, raped and murdered Eroeh, a girl Daenerys had once saved from him. Only the birth of her dragons amidst the fire and smoke of Khal Drogo's funeral pyre had spared Dany herself from being dragged back to Vaes Dothrak to live out the remainder of her days amongst the crones of the dosh khaleen.</div>

<div class="line_en">The fire burned away my hair, but elsewise it did not touch me. It had been the same in Daznak's Pit. That much she could recall, though much of what followed was a haze. So many people, screaming and shoving. She remembered rearing horses, a food cart spilling melons as it overturned. From below a spear came flying, followed by a flight of crossbow bolts. One passed so close that Dany felt it brush her cheek. Others skittered off Drogon's scales, lodged between them, or tore through the membrane of his wings. She remembered the dragon twisting beneath her, shuddering at the impacts, as she tried desperately to cling to his scaled back. The wounds were smoking. Dany saw one of the bolts burst into sudden flame. Another fell away, shaken loose by the beating of his wings. Below, she saw men whirling, wreathed in flame, hands up in the air as if caught in the throes of some mad dance. A woman in a green tokar reached for a weeping child, pulling him down into her arms to shield him from the flames. Dany saw the color vividly, but not the woman's face. People were stepping on her as they lay tangled on the bricks. Some were on fire.</div>

<div class="line_en">The sun grew hotter as it rose, and before long her head was pounding. Dany's hair was growing out again, but slowly. "I need a hat," she said aloud. Up on Dragonstone she had tried to make one for herself, weaving stalks of grass together as she had seen Dothraki women do during her time with Drogo, but either she was using the wrong sort of grass or she simply lacked the necessary skill. Her hats all fell to pieces in her hands. Try again, she told herself. You will do better the next time. You are the blood of the dragon, you can make a hat. She tried and tried, but her last attempt had been no more successful than her first.</div>

<div class="line_en">She wondered if her captain's blades still hung upon the wall beside her bed, waiting for Daario to return and claim them. "I will leave my girls with you," he had said. "Keep them safe for me, beloved." And she wondered how much the Yunkai'i knew about what her captain meant to her. She had asked Ser Barristan that question the afternoon the hostages went forth. "They will have heard the talk," he had replied. "Naharis may even have boasted of Your Grace's… of your great… regard… for him. If you will forgive my saying so, modesty is not one of the captain's virtues. He takes great pride in his… his swordsmanship."</div>

<div class="line_en">She turned back the way she'd come, to where Dragonstone rose above the grasslands like a clenched fist. It looks so close. I've been walking for hours, yet it still looks as if I could reach out and touch it. It was not too late to go back. There were fish in the spring-fed pool by Drogon's cave. She had caught one her first day there, she might catch more. And there would be scraps, charred bones with bits of flesh still on them, the remnants of Drogon's kills.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was quiet on her sea. When the wind blew the grass would sigh as the stalks brushed against each other, whispering in a tongue that only gods could understand. Now and again the little stream would gurgle where it flowed around a stone. Mud squished between her toes. Insects buzzed around her, lazy dragonflies and glistening green wasps and stinging midges almost too small to see. She swatted at them absently when they landed on her arms. Once she came upon a rat drinking from the stream, but it fled when she appeared, scurrying between the stalks to vanish in the high grass. Sometimes she heard birds singing. The sound made her belly rumble, but she had no nets to snare them with, and so far she had not come on any nests. Once I dreamed of flying, she thought, and now I've flown, and dream of stealing eggs. That made her laugh. "Men are mad and gods are madder," she told the grass, and the grass murmured its agreement.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="草海十分平静。风吹过的时候，草秆之间的触动发出阵阵叹息，它们的窃窃私语只有神灵才能听得懂。小溪偶尔流经一块石头时，便会汨汨作响地从旁边绕过。泥土从她脚趾间挤出，发出细微的咯吱声。昆虫围绕着她嗡嗡而叫，那些懒蜻蜓、发亮的绿蜂还有咬人的蚊蚋小得几乎看不见。当它们停在她手臂上时，她便心不在焉地拍打它们。有一次她撞见了一只老鼠正在小溪中饮水，她的出现令它突然奔窜于草茎中，消失于高高的草海当中。有时她还能听到鸟儿们的歌声。那音乐让她的肚子咕咕作响，但她没有任何网去捕捉这些小鸟，到目前为止，她也没有见过一个鸟巢。我曾经渴望飞翔，她心想，现在这个愿望实现了，而我却渴望偷蛋。她不由地大笑。“人疯神更狂，”她对着草海说道，后者发出了低语声，似乎在表示赞同。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">No, Dany told herself. If I look back I am lost. She might live for years amongst the sunbaked rocks of Dragonstone, riding Drogon by day and gnawing at his leavings every evenfall as the great grass sea turned from gold to orange, but that was not the life she had been born to. So once again she turned her back upon the distant hill and closed her ears to the song of flight and freedom that the wind sang as it played amongst the hill's stony ridges. The stream was trickling south by southeast, as near as she could tell. She followed it. Take me to the river, that is all I ask of you. Take me to the river, and I will do the rest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不，丹妮对自己说。如果我回头，一切就完了。也许她能够在龙石山上活上个好几年，在岩石上享受阳光的沐浴，白天的时候骑乘在卓耿身上，到了傍晚以啃食他的剩饭充饥，望着草原由金色变成橘红，但是，这样的生活并不是她与生俱来的。于是她再次转过身来，背对着远处的山丘，闭上耳朵，任由那飞翔与自由之歌在风中、在坚石缭绕的山脊间消散。那条小溪由东南向南流淌而去，起码在她看来是这样的。把我带到河边，这是我唯一的请求。带我到河边，剩下的路由我自己来走。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The hours passed slowly. The stream bent this way and that, and Dany followed, beating time upon her leg with the whip, trying not to think about how far she had to go, or the pounding in her head, or her empty belly.

<div class="line_en">Thrice that day she caught sight of Drogon. Once he was so far off that he might have been an eagle, slipping in and out of distant clouds, but Dany knew the look of him by now, even when he was no more than a speck. The second time he passed before the sun, his black wings spread, and the world darkened. The last time he flew right above her, so close she could hear the sound of his wings. For half a heartbeat Dany thought that he was hunting her, but he flew on without taking any notice of her and vanished somewhere in the east. Just as well, she thought.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当天她一共三次见到了卓耿的影子。有一次他距离远得看上去像一头老鹰，滑翔于遥远的云层间，但是丹妮已经能够认出他的样子了，即便他仅有斑点般大小。第二次他从太阳下飞过，黑色的翅膀伸展开来，然后全世界都仿佛陷入了一片晦暗。还有一次他正好走她头上飞过，他们的距离是那么的近，丹妮甚至听到了翅膀拍打的声音。有那么一瞬间丹妮以为他在追捕自己，可是他却继续往前飞去，丝毫没有留意到她的存在，然后突然消失在东边。还好，她心想。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Evening took her almost unawares. As the sun was gilding the distant spires of Dragonstone, Dany stumbled onto a low stone wall, overgrown and broken. Perhaps it had been part of a temple, or the hall of the village lord. More ruins lay beyond it -- an old well, and some circles in the grass that marked the sites where hovels had once stood. They had been built of mud and straw, she judged, but long years of wind and rain had worn them away to nothing. Dany found eight before the sun went down, but there might have been more farther out, hidden in the grass.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="傍晚在不知不觉中降临。随着金色余晖浮现于遥远的龙石山尖顶上，丹妮绊倒在一座低矮的石墙旁，周围杂草丛生，残破不堪。也许这是一座寺庙的某个部分，或者某个村子领主的大厅残余。而在石墙前面，更多的废墟映入眼帘——一口古老的井，还有一圈圈小茅屋压出的草印，虽然它们已不复存在。它们应该是用泥土和草茎搭起来的，她判断，但是长期的风雨也已经将其冲刷成一片残迹。在日落之前丹妮一共发现了八个茅屋废墟，不过在更遥远的草海中，一定埋藏着更多。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As the world darkened, Dany settled in and closed her eyes, but sleep refused to come. The night was cold, the ground hard, her belly empty. She found herself thinking of Meereen, of Daario, her love, and Hizdahr, her husband, of Irri and Jhiqui and sweet Missandei, Ser Barristan and Reznak and Skahaz Shavepate. Do they fear me dead? I flew off on a dragon's back. Will they think he ate me? She wondered if Hizdahr was still king. His crown had come from her, could he hold it in her absence? He wanted Drogon dead. I heard him. "Kill it," he screamed, "kill the beast," and the look upon his face was lustful. And Strong Belwas had been on his knees, heaving and shuddering. Poison. It had to be poison. The honeyed locusts. Hizdahr urged them on me, but Belwas ate them all. She had made Hizdahr her king, taken him into her bed, opened the fighting pits for him, he had no reason to want her dead. Yet who else could it have been? Reznak, her perfumed seneschal? The Yunkai'i? The Sons of the Harpy?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随着黑夜的降临，丹妮安顿了下来，并合上了眼睛，但她却一直睡不着。草原上的夜晚是寒冷的，土地如冰一样硬，自己的肚子也是空的。她不自觉地想起了弥林，想起了她的情人达里奥，她的丈夫希兹达赫，伊莉和姬琪，让人心疼的弥桑黛，巴利斯坦爵士，雷兹纳克还有剃头人斯卡哈日。他们会怕我已经死了吗？毕竟我骑在龙背上飞走。他们会不会觉得他吃了我？她想知道兹达赫是否还是国王。他的皇冠是从她那得到的，而他又能否在她缺席期间保住王位呢？他想让卓耿去死。我听到他说那句话了。“杀了它，”他尖叫道，“杀了这个野兽，”他的脸上充满了兽欲。壮汉贝沃斯当时跪在地上，边发抖边呕吐。毒药，一定是毒药。那些蜂蜜蝗虫。希兹达赫一直想让我尝尝，但是贝沃斯把它们都吃光了。她让希兹达赫成为了她的国王，带他上了自己的床，为了他再次开放角斗场，他没有理由想让她死。但还能有谁呢？雷兹纳克，这个洒满香水的总管？渊凯人？还是鹰身女妖之子？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The stone wall had endured better than the rest. Though it was nowhere more than three feet high, the angle where it met another, lower wall still offered some shelter from the elements, and night was coming on fast. Dany wedged herself into that corner, making a nest of sorts by tearing up handfuls of the grass that grew around the ruins. She was very tired, and fresh blisters had appeared on both her feet, including a matched set upon her pinky toes. It must be from the way I walk, she thought, giggling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这座石墙比其余废墟存活的都要久。虽然它甚至还没三尺高，充其量由两块建筑物的突起相遇而成，可它仍然能够提供遮蔽，再加上夜晚很快将至。丹妮缩进一个角落，扯下废墟周围的一些杂草，并给自己搭起了小窝。她全身疲乏，双脚上都起了新鲜的水泡，还有几个对称的印在通红的脚趾上。一定我走路的方式，她咯咯地笑着想。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She dreamed. All her cares fell away from her, and all her pains as well, and she seemed to float upward into the sky. She was flying once again, spinning, laughing, dancing, as the stars wheeled around her and whispered secrets in her ear. "To go north, you must journey south. To reach the west, you must go east. To go forward, you must go back. To touch the light you must pass beneath the shadow."</div>

<div class="line_en">The next morning she woke stiff and sore and aching, with ants crawling on her arms and legs and face. When she realized what they were, she kicked aside the stalks of dry brown grass that had served as her bed and blanket and struggled to her feet. She had bites all over her, little red bumps, itchy and inflamed. Where did all the ants come from? Dany brushed them from her arms and legs and belly. She ran a hand across her stubbly scalp where her hair had burned away, and felt more ants on her head, and one crawling down the back of her neck. She knocked them off and crushed them under her bare feet. There were so many…</div>

Perhaps one of them is Khal Drogo, sitting on his fiery stallion in the night lands and smiling down on me. Dragonstone was still visible above the grasslands. It looks so close.

<div class="line_en">Once she was certain which way was south, she counted off her paces. The stream appeared at eight. Dany cupped her hands to drink. The water made her belly cramp, but cramps were easier to bear than thirst. She had no other drink but the morning dew that glistened on the tall grass, and no food at all unless she cared to eat the grass. I could try eating ants. The little yellow ones were too small to provide much in the way of nourishment, but there were red ants in the grass, and those were bigger. "I am lost at sea," she said as she limped along beside her meandering rivulet, "so perhaps I'll find some crabs, or a nice fat fish." Her whip slapped softly against her thigh, wap wap wap. One step at a time, and the stream would see her home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当明确了哪一条路通往南方之后，她边走边算着步伐。小溪在她踏出的第八步时出现在眼前。丹妮用手做杯状舀了一点水喝。溪水让她的肚子痉挛，但这可比口渴要容易忍受多了。除了高草上闪烁的清晨露珠之外，她没有别的东西可以喝了。而除非她愿意咀嚼这些草，丹妮也没有任何食物。我可以尝试吃蚂蚁。这些又小又黄的东西小到没有什么营养，但草原里有红蚁，红蚁的个头会大一点。“既然我迷失在一片海洋，”她边说边沿着蜿蜒的小溪蹒跚而行，“那么也许我能找到一些螃蟹，或者一条肥大的鱼儿也说不定。”她的鞭子轻轻的拍打在大腿上，啪，啪，啪。一步一步来，小溪会带她回家的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dany took a moment to make certain of her directions. It would not do to walk the wrong way and lose her stream. "My friend," she said aloud. "If I stay close to my friend I won't get lost." She would have slept beside the water if she dared, but there were animals who came down to the stream to drink at night. She had seen their tracks. Dany would make a poor meal for a wolf or lion, but even a poor meal was better than none.</div>

<div class="line_en">Just past midday she came upon a bush growing by the stream, its twisted limbs covered with hard green berries. Dany squinted at them suspiciously, then plucked one from a branch and nibbled at it. Its flesh was tart and chewy, with a bitter aftertaste that seemed familiar to her. "In the khalasar, they used berries like these to flavor roasts," she decided. Saying it aloud made her more certain of it. Her belly rumbled, and Dany found herself picking berries with both hands and tossing them into her mouth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正午刚过，她沿着小溪来到了一片灌木丛，弯曲的枝节上挂满了绿色的硬果子。丹妮可疑地斜望了它们两眼，便从其中一枝上摘下了一颗，咬了下去。果肉酸而耐嚼，过后还有一阵熟悉的苦涩。“在卡拉萨里，他们用这种浆果来伴着烤肉吃，”她告诉自己。大声说出来会让她感到更加得确定。她的肚子开始咕咕叫，接下来丹妮发现自己已经在用双手摘果子，并把它们往嘴里塞。">查看中文翻译</div>

In Westeros the dead of House Targaryen were given to the flames, but who would light her pyre here? My flesh will feed the wolves and carrion crows, she thought sadly, and worms will burrow through my womb. Her eyes went back to Dragonstone. It looked smaller. She could see smoke rising from its wind-carved summit, miles away. Drogon has returned from hunting.</div>

She sat up, afraid that she had soiled herself as she slept. When she brought her fingers to her face, she could smell the blood on them. Am I dying? Then she saw the pale crescent moon, floating high above the grass, and it came to her that this was no more than her moon blood.</div>

She scooped up a handful of mud and water in trembling hands. By midday the water would be tepid, but in the chill of dawn it was almost cool and helped her keep her eyes open. As she splashed her face, she saw fresh blood on her thighs. The ragged hem of her under-tunic was stained with it. The sight of so much red frightened her.

Her bare legs tightened around the dragon's neck. She kicked him, and Drogon threw himself into the sky.

Soon one horse began to lag behind the others.
