<div class="line_en">Sara not only could tell stories, but she adored telling them. When she sat or stood in the midst of a circle and began to invent wonderful things, her green eyes grew big and shining, her cheeks flushed, and, without knowing that she was doing it, she began to act and made what she told lovely or alarming by the raising or dropping of her voice, the bend and sway of her slim body, and the dramatic movement of her hands. She forgot that she was talking to listening children; she saw and lived with the fairy folk, or the kings and queens and beautiful ladies, whose adventures she was narrating. Sometimes when she had finished her story, she was quite out of breath with excitement, and would lay her hand on her thin, little, quick-rising chest, and half laugh as if at herself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="萨拉不仅会讲故事，而且热衷于讲。当她坐在或站在人群围成的小圈子中间开始编造精采的情节时，一双绿眼睛变得又大又亮，双颊泛红；她会不知不觉地开始表演起来，用抑扬顿挫的语调、俯仰摇摆的苗条身躯和戏剧性的手势，使她所讲的内容既美妙又惊险。她忘记自己是在给孩子们讲故事，看见了她讲述的惊险故事中的神话人物，或者国王、王后以及美丽的贵妇人，并且同他们生活在一起。有时候，她讲完了故事，兴奋得上气不接下气，会把手放在她那瘦小的急促起伏着的胸脯上，半笑着像在自嘲似的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Anyone who has been at school with a teller of stories knows what the wonder means -- how he or she is followed about and besought in a whisper to relate romances; how groups gather round and hang on the outskirts of the favored party in the hope of being allowed to join in and listen.</div>

<div class="line_en">Of course the greatest power Sara possessed and the one which gained her even more followers than her luxuries and the fact that she was "the show pupil," the power that Lavinia and certain other girls were most envious of, and at the same time most fascinated by in spite of themselves, was her power of telling stories and of making everything she talked about seem like a story, whether it was one or not.</div>

<div class="line_en">She had been at Miss Minchin's school about two years when, one foggy winter's afternoon, as she was getting out of her carriage, comfortably wrapped up in her warmest velvets and furs and looking very much grander than she knew, she caught sight, as she crossed the pavement, of a dingy little figure standing on the area steps, and stretching its neck so that its wide-open eyes might peer at her through the railings. Something in the eagerness and timidity of the smudgy face made her look at it, and when she looked she smiled because it was her way to smile at people.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="萨拉在铭钦女士的学校里呆了约两年了。冬季的一天下午，浓雾弥漫，她从她的马车里下来，舒适地裹着她最暖和的天鹅绒和裘皮衣服，看上去雍容华贵，大大超过了她的想象。当她跨过人行道时，忽然瞥见厨房前采光小天井的台阶上站着一个邋遢的小人，正睁大眼睛伸长脖子以便能通过栏杆仔细窥视她。那既表现出热情又有着畏怯的污迹斑斑的小脸上，还流露出一点什么，使萨拉对她看。萨拉看她时带着微笑，因为对人微笑正是她的一贯做法。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"When I am telling it," she would say, "it doesn't seem as if it was only made up. It seems more real than you are -- more real than the schoolroom. I feel as if I were all the people in the story -- one after the other. It is queer."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我讲故事的时候，”萨拉会这样说，“那似乎不仅仅是编造的故事。它似乎比你本人更真实——比学校的教室还真实。我觉得仿佛自己就是故事里的各种人物——一个接一个。真是奇怪。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But the owner of the smudgy face and the wide-open eyes evidently was afraid that she ought not to have been caught looking at pupils of importance. She dodged out of sight like a jack-in-the-box and scurried back into the kitchen, disappearing so suddenly that if she had not been such a poor little forlorn thing, Sara would have laughed in spite of herself. That very evening, as Sara was sitting in the midst of a group of listeners in a corner of the schoolroom telling one of her stories, the very same figure timidly entered the room, carrying a coal box much too heavy for her, and knelt down upon the hearth rug to replenish the fire and sweep up the ashes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是那张污迹斑斑的脸和睁大的眼睛的主人，显然担心自己被人发现正在窥视那地位优越的学生。她像匣子里藏着的那种玩具跳偶般匆匆回进厨房躲藏起来，一下子失去了踪影，若不是她显得这样的孤苦伶仃，萨拉会情不自禁地笑起来的。就在当天傍晚，在教室的一角，萨拉坐在一群听众中间讲故事，这小东西怯生生地走进房间，拎着一箱对她来说实在太沉重的煤，在壁炉前的地毯上跪下，给炉火添煤、清除炉灰。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a wonderful story about a princess who was loved by a Prince Merman, and went to live with him in shining caves under the sea.</div>

<div class="line_en">She was cleaner than she had been when she peeped through the area railings, but she looked just as frightened. She was evidently afraid to look at the children or seem to be listening. She put on pieces of coal cautiously with her fingers so that she might make no disturbing noise, and she swept about the fire irons very softly. But Sara saw in two minutes that she was deeply interested in what was going on, and that she was doing her work slowly in the hope of catching a word here and there. And realizing this, she raised her voice and spoke more clearly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她比在天井栏杆后面窥视时洁净些了，但看上去还是那么惊惶不安。她显然不敢正眼看这些孩子，也不敢显出在听的样子。她小心翼翼地用手指一块一块地添煤，以免发出扰人的响声，清理火炉用具时的动作也很轻柔。不到两分钟，萨拉就看出她对眼前发生的事深感兴趣，正慢慢地干着活，希望东一句西一句地听明白一些内容。萨拉领悟到这一点，就提高了嗓音讲述得更清晰了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The small drudge before the grate swept the hearth once and then swept it again. Having done it twice, she did it three times; and, as she was doing it the third time, the sound of the story so lured her to listen that she fell under the spell and actually forgot that she had no right to listen at all, and also forgot everything else. She sat down upon her heels as she knelt on the hearth rug, and the brush hung idly in her fingers. The voice of the storyteller went on and drew her with it into winding grottos under the sea, glowing with soft, clear blue light, and paved with pure golden sands. Strange sea flowers and grasses waved about her, and far away faint singing and music echoed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个小奴仆在壁炉前将炉边的地面清扫了一次又一次。扫过了两次，再扫第三次，讲故事的声音是如此地诱人，以至于她被迷住了，忘记自己根本无权听故事，也忘记了其他的一切。她跪在壁炉前的地毯上，索性坐在脚后跟上，刷子闲吊在手指间。讲故事人的话音继续着，把她引入了迂回曲折的海底洞室。里面闪耀着柔和清澈的蓝光，地上铺的是纯净的金沙。奇异的海底花草在她周围荡漾，远处隐隐约约地回响着歌声与音乐声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ah, indeed, Mademoiselle Sara might well ask. She was a forlorn little thing who had just taken the place of scullery maid -- though, as to being scullery maid, she was everything else besides. She blacked boots and grates, and carried heavy coal-scuttles up and down stairs, and scrubbed floors and cleaned windows, and was ordered about by everybody. She was fourteen years old, but was so stunted in growth that she looked about twelve. In truth, Mariette was sorry for her. She was so timid that if one chanced to speak to her it appeared as if her poor, frightened eyes would jump out of her head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="啊，的确，作为萨拉小姐完全可以问一问。她是个孤苦伶仃的小东西，刚刚接替厨房洗碗婢女的差使——然而虽然是个洗碗婢女，其他不论什么差事却样样都得干。她擦皮靴和壁炉，上下楼搬运沉甸甸的煤桶，擦地板，擦窗户，人人都把她呼来唤去。她十四岁了，但发育不良，看上去只有十二岁左右。说真的，马里耶特也觉得她可怜。她是那样畏怯，如果有人偶尔对她讲话，她那双可怜受惊的眼睛好像就要蹦出她的眼眶似的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There are much more splendid stories in Revelation," returned Sara. "Just look and see! How do you know mine are fairy stories? But I can tell you" -- with a fine bit of unheavenly temper -- "you will never find out whether they are or not if you're not kinder to people than you are now. Come along, Lottie." And she marched out of the room, rather hoping that she might see the little servant again somewhere, but she found no trace of her when she got into the hall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“《圣经》的《启示录》中还有好多出色的故事哪，”萨拉回敬道。“仔细去看看吧！你怎么知道我的故事是捏造的神话？但是我要告诉你，”——不免流露出点凡人的脾气来——“你如果不能从此对人们和善一些，那你就永远弄不清那些故事是不是捏造的神话。来吧，洛蒂。”她大踏步走出房间，很希望能在什么地方再看到那个小丫头，但是当她进人大厅时却不见那丫头的踪迹。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But a few weeks later, on another foggy afternoon, when she entered her sitting room she found herself confronting a rather pathetic picture. In her own special and pet easy-chair before the bright fire, Becky -- with a coal smudge on her nose and several on her apron, with her poor little cap hanging half off her head, and an empty coal box on the floor near her -- sat fast asleep, tired out beyond even the endurance of her hard-working young body. She had been sent up to put the bedrooms in order for the evening. There were a great many of them, and she had been running about all day. Sara's rooms she had saved until the last. They were not like the other rooms, which were plain and bare. Ordinary pupils were expected to be satisfied with mere necessaries. Sara's comfortable sitting room seemed a bower of luxury to the scullery maid, though it was, in fact, merely a nice, bright little room. But there were pictures and books in it, and curious things from India; there was a sofa and the low, soft chair; Emily sat in a chair of her own, with the air of a presiding goddess, and there was always a glowing fire and a polished grate. Becky saved it until the end of her afternoon's work, because it rested her to go into it, and she always hoped to snatch a few minutes to sit down in the soft chair and look about her, and think about the wonderful good fortune of the child who owned such surroundings and who went out on the cold days in beautiful hats and coats one tried to catch a glimpse of through the area railing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是几星期后，又是一个多雾的下午，萨拉进入起居室时，发现自己面对一幕相当哀婉动人的场面。在明亮的炉火前，贝基坐在萨拉喜爱的、自己专用的安乐椅里熟睡着，鼻子上有一处煤灰污斑，围裙上也有几处，破旧的小帽子半挂在头上，近处的地板上有只空煤箱——她疲劳已极，竟然超过了那劳累的小身躯的忍受能力。她是被打发上楼来整理傍晚用的各个卧室的。房间很多，她跑来跑去，已有一整天。她将萨拉的房间留到最后。这些房间不像其他的那样朴素而空荡荡的。一般学生只应该满足于最起码的生活必需品。对这厨房婢女来说，萨拉舒适的起居室就像是豪华的闺房一样，虽然它实际上只不过是一间精巧明亮的小房间。但是室内有些图画和书籍，还有来自印度的珍奇物品；有一张沙发和一把软垫很低的椅子。埃米莉坐在她自己的椅子上，神气活像主事的女神，而壁炉总是擦得锃亮，炉火总是烧得红彤彤的，贝基把这间房留到下午干活的最后，因为进去了可以得到歇息，她总是希望能抓住几分钟在软椅子上坐下来，环顾一下四周，思量着享有这种环境的孩子，她有多好的运气，冷天外出时穿戴着美丽的帽子和外套，让你想通过采光小天井前的栏杆看上一眼。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sara sat and looked into the fire, reflecting on Becky for some time after Mariette left her. She made up a story of which Becky was the ill-used heroine. She thought she looked as if she had never had quite enough to eat. Her very eyes were hungry. She hoped she should see her again, but though she caught sight of her carrying things up or down stairs on several occasions, she always seemed in such a hurry and so afraid of being seen that it was impossible to speak to her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="马里耶特走后，萨拉坐在那里望着炉火，仔细地想了—会儿贝基的事。她编了个故事，贝基是故事中被虐待的女主人公。萨拉想她看上去好像从来没有充足的食物吃。她的眼神流露出饥饿的神色。萨拉希望能再见到她，可是虽然有几次瞥见她搬东西上下楼，她总是显得那样匆忙和害怕被人看见，实在不可能对她讲话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On this particular afternoon she had been taking her dancing lesson, and the afternoon on which the dancing master appeared was rather a grand occasion at the seminary, though it occurred every week. The pupils were attired in their prettiest frocks, and as Sara danced particularly well, she was very much brought forward, and Mariette was requested to make her as diaphanous and fine as possible.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在这个下午，萨拉上了舞蹈课。虽说每星期都有一次舞蹈课，但每当舞蹈教师出现的那个下午，总是培育院的盛大节日。到时候学生们穿上她们最漂亮的连衣裙，由于萨拉的舞跳得特别好，就被推到最前头，并且事先让马里耶特尽可能地把她穿戴得轻盈优美。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On this afternoon, when she had sat down, the sensation of relief to her short, aching legs had been so wonderful and delightful that it had seemed to soothe her whole body, and the glow of warmth and comfort from the fire had crept over her like a spell, until, as she looked at the red coals, a tired, slow smile stole over her smudged face, her head nodded forward without her being aware of it, her eyes drooped, and she fell fast asleep. She had really been only about ten minutes in the room when Sara entered, but she was in as deep a sleep as if she had been, like the Sleeping Beauty, slumbering for a hundred years. But she did not look -- poor Becky -- like a Sleeping Beauty at all. She looked only like an ugly, stunted, worn-out little scullery drudge.</div>

<div class="line_en">She took a seat on the edge of the table, and sat swinging her slim, rose-colored legs, and wondering what it would be best to do. Miss Amelia might come in at any moment, and if she did, Becky would be sure to be scolded.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她在桌子边缘上坐下来，摇摆着那双玫瑰色的细腿，迟疑着不知做什么好。阿米莉亚小姐随时会进来，如果她来了，贝基肯定会受到叱责。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But she is so tired," she thought. "She is so tired!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可是她是那么累，”萨拉想，“的确那么累啊！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She sprang up and clutched at her cap. She felt it dangling over her ear, and tried wildly to put it straight. Oh, she had got herself into trouble now with a vengeance! To have impudently fallen asleep on such a young lady's chair! She would be turned out of doors without wages.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="贝基—跃而起，去抓自己的帽子。她发觉帽子挂在耳朵上，慌忙把它戴正。唉，她这下可有大麻烦啦。竟然冒冒失失地在这样一位小姐的座椅上睡熟了！她会被赶出大门，拿不到工钱。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A piece of flaming coal ended her perplexity for her that very moment. It broke off from a large lump and fell on to the fender. Becky started, and opened her eyes with a frightened gasp. She did not know she had fallen asleep. She had only sat down for one moment and felt the beautiful glow -- and here she found herself staring in wild alarm at the wonderful pupil, who sat perched quite near her, like a rose-colored fairy, with interested eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一块闪着火焰的煤顷刻间结束了萨拉的困惑。它从一大块煤上爆开，落到炉子的围栏上。贝基惊醒了，睁开眼睛，吓得倒抽了一口气。她不知道自己睡着了。她只不过想坐一会儿，感受一下那炉火的美丽光辉——而此刻却发现自己正惊惶失措地望着那位了不起的学生，那学生居高临下，离她很近，像一个玫瑰色的仙女，带着关切的眼神。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She made a sound like a big breathless sob.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她透不过气来似的猛然哽咽了一声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sara jumped down, and came quite close to her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="萨拉从桌子边上跳下来，上前紧靠着贝基。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Don't be frightened," she said, quite as if she had been speaking to a little girl like herself. "It doesn't matter the least bit."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不要害怕，”她说，就像对跟自己一样的小姑娘一样。“一点儿也不要紧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, miss! Oh, miss!" she stuttered. "I arst yer pardon, miss! Oh, I do, miss!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“呀，小姐！呀，小姐！”她结结巴巴地说，“我求你原谅，小姐！啊，我求你，小姐！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">How poor Becky stared at her! In fact, she had never heard such a nice, friendly sound in anyone's voice before. She was used to being ordered about and scolded, and having her ears boxed. And this one -- in her rose-colored dancing afternoon splendor -- was looking at her as if she were not a culprit at all -- as if she had a right to be tired -- even to fall asleep! The touch of the soft, slim little paw on her shoulder was the most amazing thing she had ever known.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="贝基瞪眼望着她，样子多可怜啊！说真的，贝基从没在任何人那儿听到过这样动听而又友善的声音。她习惯于受差遣，被斥责，吃耳光。而这位小姐——穿着下午跳舞时的玫瑰色华丽服装——正望着她，好像她根本不是犯了罪的人——她似乎有权感到疲劳——甚至有权睡着！那柔软纤巧的小手在她肩上的触摸是她所体验过的最美好奇异的感觉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sara broke into a friendly little laugh, and put her hand on her shoulder.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="萨拉忍不住友好地轻声笑起来，把手放到贝基肩上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I didn't go to do it, miss," protested Becky. "It was the warm fire -- an' me bein' so tired. It -- it WASN'T imperence!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“并不是我要那样做的，小姐，”贝基申辩道。“都是那暖和的炉火——而我又是那么疲倦。这——这可不是故意冒犯！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Ain't -- ain't yer angry, miss?" she gasped. "Ain't yer goin' to tell the missus?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你不——不生气吗，小姐？”她喘吁吁地说。“你不去告诉女东家吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You were tired," she said; "you could not help it. You are not really awake yet."</div>

<div class="line_en">"No one is anywhere about," she explained. "If your bedrooms are finished, perhaps you might stay a tiny while. I thought -- perhaps -- you might like a piece of cake."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“附近没有外人，”她解释道，“如果你把卧室都收拾好了，或许可以呆一小会儿。我想——或许——你可能喜欢吃一块蛋糕。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The woeful fright in the coal-smutted face made her suddenly so sorry that she could scarcely bear it. One of her queer thoughts rushed into her mind. She put her hand against Becky's cheek.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="萨拉为那张沾满了煤黑的脸上痛苦恐惧的表情伤心得难以自持。一个奇特的想法忽然窜人脑海。她伸手抚着贝基的面颊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Becky did not understand in the least. Her mind could not grasp such amazing thoughts, and "an accident" meant to her a calamity in which some one was run over or fell off a ladder and was carried to "the 'orspital."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="贝基一点儿也不明白。她的头脑无法理解这样奇异的想法，而“意外事件”对她来说通常只意味着有人被车碾了或者从梯子上摔下来之类的灾难，需要送进医院。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你干完你的活儿了吗？”她问道。“你敢不敢在这儿再呆几分钟？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes," Sara answered, and she looked at her dreamily for a moment. But the next she spoke in a different tone. She realized that Becky did not know what she meant.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，”萨拉回答，有点出神地看了贝基一会儿，接着就用完全不同的口气说话。她意识到贝基不懂她的意思。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The next ten minutes seemed to Becky like a sort of delirium. Sara opened a cupboard, and gave her a thick slice of cake. She seemed to rejoice when it was devoured in hungry bites. She talked and asked questions, and laughed until Becky's fears actually began to calm themselves, and she once or twice gathered boldness enough to ask a question or so herself, daring as she felt it to be.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随后的十分钟对贝基来说，就像是一种极度兴奋的梦境。萨拉打开食橱，递给她厚厚一片蛋糕。当蛋糕被她狼吞虎咽地吃下去时，萨拉显得很高兴。萨拉同她谈笑，询问，直到贝基的畏惧心理实际上已开始自行消逝，而且有那么一两次，贝基竟鼓足勇气提出了问题，自己觉得胆子很大了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Is that --" she ventured, looking longingly at the rose-colored frock. And she asked it almost in a whisper. "Is that there your best?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那是——”贝基冒昧地问道，羡慕地看着那玫瑰色的连衣裙，问话的声音低似耳语，“那是你最好的吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It is one of my dancing-frocks," answered Sara. "I like it, don't you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这是我跳舞用的连衣裙中的一件，”萨拉回答。“我喜欢这件，你喜欢吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For a few seconds Becky was almost speechless with admiration. Then she said in an awed voice, "Onct I see a princess. I was standin' in the street with the crowd outside Covin' Garden, watchin' the swells go inter the operer. An' there was one everyone stared at most. They ses to each other, `That's the princess.' She was a growed-up young lady, but she was pink all over -- gownd an' cloak, an' flowers an' all. I called her to mind the minnit I see you, sittin' there on the table, miss. You looked like her."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="仰慕之情使贝基一时几乎说不出话来。随后她以敬畏的口气说：“有一次我看到一位公主。我当时站在街头，和科文特公园歌剧院①外面的人群一起看穿着时髦的人走进去。其中有一位，人人都争着看。都说‘那就是公主’。她是位年轻小姐，全身粉红色——长礼服、斗篷、鲜花和一切。我刚才看见你坐在桌子上的那一刻就想起了她，小姐。你看上去像她。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Becky stared at her admiringly, and, as before, did not understand her in the least. She watched her with a sort of adoration. Very soon Sara left her reflections and turned to her with a new question.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="贝基赞赏地瞪眼望着她，和以前一样，一点儿也不理解她的意思。她用崇拜的目光注视着她。萨拉迅即摆脱了沉思默想，向贝基提出一个新问题。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I've often thought," said Sara, in her reflecting voice, "that I should like to be a princess; I wonder what it feels like. I believe I will begin pretending I am one."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我常常想，”萨拉用她那种沉思的语调说，“我该乐意成为一位公主；我不晓得做公主的感觉是怎样的。我想我要开始假装我就是一位公主。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, miss," confessed Becky, a little alarmed again. "I knowed I hadn't orter, but it was that beautiful I -- I couldn't help it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，小姐，”贝基承认，又有点惊慌。“我知道自己不该听，但是那故事太美了，我——我忍不住想听。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Becky," she said, "weren't you listening to that story?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“贝基，”她说，“那一次你不是听了那个故事吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Me hear it?" she cried. "Like as if I was a pupil, miss! All about the Prince -- and the little white Mer-babies swimming about laughing -- with stars in their hair?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“让我听？”她惊呼道。“就当我也是个学生，小姐！那全是讲那个王子——还有那些白色的小人鱼，嘻嘻哈哈地游来游去，头发里闪着星星，是吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I liked you to listen to it," said Sara. "If you tell stories, you like nothing so much as to tell them to people who want to listen. I don't know why it is. Would you like to hear the rest?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我喜欢让你听，”萨拉说。“如果你讲故事，没有什么能比讲给那些想要听的人们听更令人高兴的了。我不懂这是为什么。你想听那故事的其余部分吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You haven't time to hear it now, I'm afraid," she said; "but if you will tell me just what time you come to do my rooms, I will try to be here and tell you a bit of it every day until it is finished. It's a lovely long one -- and I'm always putting new bits to it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“恐怕你现在没时间听了，”她说，“但是只要你能告诉我什么时候来收拾我的屋子，我就会尽可能呆在这儿，每天给你讲一点，直到讲完为止。那是个可爱的长故事——而且我总是不断增加一点儿新的内容。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When Becky went downstairs, she was not the same Becky who had staggered up, loaded down by the weight of the coal scuttle. She had an extra piece of cake in her pocket, and she had been fed and warmed, but not only by cake and fire. Something else had warmed and fed her, and the something else was Sara.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="贝基下楼时，已经不是原来那个被煤箱压弯了腰、蹒跚地上楼的贝基了。她衣袋里装着另外一块蛋糕，腹中充实，身上暖和，这不仅仅是由于蛋糕和炉火的作用。另外还有点儿什么使她觉得充实与温暖，那就是萨拉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"If I WAS a princess -- a REAL princess," she murmured, "I could scatter largess to the populace. But even if I am only a pretend princess, I can invent little things to do for people. Things like this. She was just as happy as if it was largess. I'll pretend that to do things people like is scattering largess. I've scattered largess."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“如果我正是公主——一位真正的公主，”她喃喃自语，“我就能向老百姓撒赏钱。但是即使我只是位假装的公主，我也能想出些为老百姓做的小事情。就像这样的事情。就好比是赏钱一样，公主她会感到同样幸福的。我要假设做人们喜欢的事，就是发赏钱。我撒过赏钱啦。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When she was gone Sara sat on her favorite perch on the end of her table. Her feet were on a chair, her elbows on her knees, and her chin in her hands.</div>
