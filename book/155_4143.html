<div class="line_en">This order, given by me to Cecil Jacobs, was the beginning of a rather thin time for Jem and me. My fists were clenched and I was ready to let fly. Atticus had promised me he would wear me out if he ever heard of me fighting any more; I was far too old and too big for such childish things, and the sooner I learned to hold in, the better off everybody would be. I soon forgot.</div>

<div class="line_en">My father looked at me mildly, amusement in his eyes. Despite our compromise, my campaign to avoid school had continued in one form or another since my first day's dose of it: the beginning of last September had brought on sinking spells, dizziness, and mild gastric complaints. I went so far as to pay a nickel for the privilege of rubbing my head against the head of Miss Rachel's cook's son, who was afflicted with a tremendous ringworm. It didn't take.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爸爸很和蔼地看着我，眼里闪着快乐的光芒。尽管我们已经相互妥协，可是从我第一天尝到上学的滋味起，我一直在变换手法，争取不上学。九月份一开始就使我情绪一阵阵低落，头也昏，胃也有点痛。我甚至还出五分钱的镍币，让雷切尔小姐家厨师的儿子同意我用脑袋磨擦他的脑袋。他有一块很大的金钱癣，但我并没传染上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Atticus sighed. "I'm simply defending a Negro -- his name's Tom Robinson. He lives in that little settlement beyond the town dump. He's a member of Calpurnia's church, and Cal knows his family well. She says they're clean-living folks. Scout, you aren't old enough to understand some things yet, but there's been some high talk around town to the effect that I shouldn't do much about defending this man. It's a peculiar case -- it won't come to trial until summer session. John Taylor was kind enough to give us a postponement…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿迪克斯叹了口气。“我只不过是为一个黑人辩护罢了——他叫汤姆·鲁宾逊，住在镇上的垃圾场那边那闻小屋里。他是卡尔珀尼亚那个教会组织中的成员之一，卡尔珀尼亚很了解他们家，她说他们是安分守己的人。斯各特，你还小，有些事还不懂。我能告诉你的是，最近镇上有些议论，说我不该出力为黑人辩护。这是个特殊的案子——夏季开庭期以前不会审判的。约翰·泰勒挺好，同意延期审判…”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"For a number of reasons," said Atticus. "The main one is, if I didn't I couldn't hold up my head in town, I couldn't represent this county in the legislature, I couldn't even tell you or Jem not to do something again."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“大概是这样。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Because I could never ask you to mind me again. Scout, simply by the nature of the work, every lawyer gets at least one case in his lifetime that affects him personally. This one's mine, I guess. You might hear some ugly talk about it at school, but do one thing for me if you will: you just hold your head high and keep those fists down. No matter what anybody says to you, don't you let 'em get your goat. Try fighting with your head for a change… it's a good one, even if it does resist learning."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“因为我再不能要求你们听我的话了。斯各特，这种工作的性质决定了每一个律师在他的一生中总要办一个影响到他本人的案子。我想，这个就是我的案子。在学校你可能会听到一些关于这件事的不堪入耳的议论，但如果你愿意的话，请为我做一件事：这就是抬起头来，放下拳头。不管谁对你说什么，也不要生气，换个方法，用你的脑袋和别人斗…你的脑袋尽管在学习上不大灵，在这方面还是个好脑袋。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You sound like Cousin Ike Finch," I said. Cousin Ike Finch was Maycomb County's sole surviving Confederate veteran. He wore a General Hood type beard of which he was inordinately vain. At least once a year Atticus, Jem and I called on him, and I would have to kiss him. It was horrible. Jem and I would listen respectfully to Atticus and Cousin Ike rehash the war. "Tell you, Atticus," Cousin Ike would say, "the Missouri Compromise was what licked us, but if I had to go through it agin I'd walk every step of the way there an' every step back jist like I did before an' furthermore we'd whip 'em this time… now in 1864, when Stonewall Jackson came around by -- I beg your pardon, young folks.

<div class="line_en">"Come here, Scout," said Atticus. I crawled into his lap and tucked my head under his chin. He put his arms around me and rocked me gently. "It's different this time," he said. "This time we aren't fighting the Yankees, we're fighting our friends. But remember this, no matter how bitter things get, they're still our friends and this is still our home."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“过来，斯各特。”阿迪克斯说。我爬到他的膝上，把头伸到他的下巴下面。他用手搂着我轻轻地摇着。“这次不同了，”他说，“这次我们不是和北方佬打仗，而是和朋友较量。但是记住这一点，不管事情变得对我们多么不利，他们仍然是我们的朋友，这里仍是我们的家。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">With this in mind, I faced Cecil Jacobs in the schoolyard next day: "You gonna take that back, boy?"</div>

<div class="line_en">I suppose I should include Uncle Jimmy, Aunt Alexandra's husband, but as he never spoke a word to me in my life except to say, "Get off the fence," once, I never saw any reason to take notice of him. Neither did Aunt Alexandra. Long ago, in a burst of friendliness, Aunty and Uncle Jimmy produced a son named Henry, who left home as soon as was humanly possible, married, and produced Francis. Henry and his wife deposited Francis at his grandparents' every Christmas, then pursued their own pleasures.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我想应该把亚历山德拉姑妈的丈夫，吉米姑父也算在内，但我长这么大，他从没跟我说过话，只有一次他说了句：“下来，不要爬栅栏。”我从不觉得有必要注意他，亚历山德拉姑妈也是这样想的。很久以前，由于友谊的进发，姑妈和吉米姑父生了个男孩，取名亨利。亨利刚够年龄就离开家里，结了婚，生了弗朗西斯。亨利和他妻子每年圣诞节把弗朗西斯放在爷爷奶奶家里，而他们自己则去寻欢作乐。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">No amount of sighing could induce Atticus to let us spend Christmas day at home. We went to Finch's Landing every Christmas in my memory. The fact that Aunty was a good cook was some compensation for being forced to spend a religious holiday with Francis Hancock. He was a year older than I, and I avoided him on principle: he enjoyed everything I disapproved of, and disliked my ingenuous diversions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无论怎样叹气，阿迪克斯也不会让我们在家里过圣诞节的。在我的记忆中，每年圣诞节我们都去芬奇庄园。姑妈是个好厨师，这倒是弥补了被迫和弗朗西斯一道过节的烦恼。他比我大一岁，我的原则是回避他，因为我不赞成的他都欣赏，而我最喜欢的娱乐活动他都讨厌。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When Uncle Jack jumped down from the train Christmas Eve day, we had to wait for the porter to hand him two long packages. Jem and I always thought it funny when Uncle Jack pecked Atticus on the cheek; they were the only two men we ever saw kiss each other. Uncle Jack shook hands with Jem and swung me high, but not high enough: Uncle Jack was a head shorter than Atticus; the baby of the family, he was younger than Aunt Alexandra. He and Aunty looked alike, but Uncle Jack made better use of his face: we were never wary of his sharp nose and chin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="圣诞节的前一天，当杰克叔叔从火车上下来时，我们等了他一会儿，直到搬运工人递给他两个长长的包裹。每次杰克叔叔像鸟儿似的在阿迪克斯的脸上啄几下时，杰姆和我觉得好笑。他们是我们看到的相互亲吻的唯一的两个男子汉。杰克叔叔和杰姆握握手，把我抱起来在空中高高地转几圈，但不太高：杰克叔叔比阿迪克斯矮一个头。他排行最小，比亚历山德拉姑妈小。他和姑妈长得很相像。但杰克叔叔的脸型好一点，他的尖鼻子、尖下巴一点也不叫我们害怕。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Aunt Alexandra was Atticus's sister, but when Jem told me about changelings and siblings, I decided that she had been swapped at birth, that my grandparents had perhaps received a Crawford instead of a Finch. Had I ever harbored the mystical notions about mountains that seem to obsess lawyers and judges, Aunt Alexandra would have been analogous to Mount Everest: throughout my early life, she was cold and there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="亚历山德拉姑妈是阿迪克斯的妹妹，但是杰姆跟我说过小孩出生时有被人调换的现像。我肯定她生下来时被人掉了包，我爷爷奶奶得到的是克劳福德家的后裔而不是芬奇家的。律师和法官对于山脉似乎老是有些神秘的概念，要是当年我也有他们那些概念的话，我会把亚历山德拉姑妈比作埃非尔士峰了在我幼小的记忆中，她一直冷冰冰地矗立在那儿，拿她没办法。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was one of the few men of science who never terrified me, probably because he never behaved like a doctor. Whenever he performed a minor service for Jem and me, as removing a splinter from a foot, he would tell us exactly what he was going to do, give us an estimation of how much it would hurt, and explain the use of any tongs he employed. One Christmas I lurked in corners nursing a twisted splinter in my foot, permitting no one to come near me. When Uncle Jack caught me, he kept me laughing about a preacher who hated going to church so much that every day he stood at his gate in his dressing-gown, smoking a hookah and delivering five-minute sermons to any passers-by who desired spiritual comfort. I interrupted to make Uncle Jack let me know when he would pull it out, but he held up a bloody splinter in a pair of tweezers and said he yanked it while I was laughing, that was what was known as relativity.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他是那些少数从不让我害怕的科学工作者之一，很可能是因为他的举止从不像个医生。每次他给杰姆或我诊治小毛病，例如拔出脚上的刺时，他都告诉我们他准备干什么，为我们估计会痛到什么程度，并且解释他使用的镊子的用途。有一次过圣诞节时，我躲在一个角落里，脚上扎进一根弯弯的长刺。我不让任何人靠近我。杰克叔叔抓住了我，他给我讲了个牧师的故事，这人最恨去教堂做礼拜，所以每天穿着晨衣，抽着水烟筒，站在大门口，对每一个寻求精神安慰的人他都要作五分钟的说教。听他讲故事时，我一直笑个不停。当我打断他的故事，要他告诉我什么时候把刺拔出来时，他用镊子夹着根血糊糊的刺，说当我捧腹大笑时，他已用力拔出来了，这就是人们所说的相对论。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Finch's Landing consisted of three hundred and sixty-six steps down a high bluff and ending in a jetty. Farther down stream, beyond the bluff, were traces of an old cotton landing, where Finch Negroes had loaded bales and produce, unloaded blocks of ice, flour and sugar, farm equipment, and feminine apparel. A two-rut road ran from the riverside and vanished among dark trees.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="芬奇庄园坐落在河边的陡岸上，从上到下，有三百六十六级阶梯，一直延伸到水中的小码头。顺着河流往下走，地势逐渐平坦，在那儿可以看见从前装卸棉花的地方。在那儿芬奇家的黑奴曾经把大包大包的棉花和其他农产品装上船只，从船上卸下冰块、面粉、糖、农具以及各种女式服装。一条被压出两道车辙印的马车路从河边向外蜿蜒伸展，消失在黑魑魃的树林中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At the end of the road was a two-storied white house with porches circling it upstairs and downstairs. In his old age, our ancestor Simon Finch had built it to please his nagging wife; but with the porches all resemblance to ordinary houses of its era ended. The internal arrangements of the Finch house were indicative of Simon's guilelessness and the absolute trust with which he regarded his offspring.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="路的尽头有一幢两层楼的房子，楼上楼下都有走廊围着。很早以前，我们的祖先西蒙·芬奇修建这栋房子是为了满足他那位爱唠叨的妻子的要求。但是，由于有个这样的走廊，这房子与当时的普通房屋的式样大不一样。室内的设计可以说明西蒙的坦率正直和对后代的绝对信任。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There were six bedrooms upstairs, four for the eight female children, one for Welcome Finch, the sole son, and one for visiting relatives. Simple enough; but the daughters' rooms could be reached only by one staircase, Welcome's room and the guestroom only by another. The Daughters' Staircase was in the ground-floor bedroom of their parents, so Simon always knew the hours of his daughters' nocturnal comings and goings.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="楼上有六间卧室，四间是八个女孩子住的，一间是独子威尔卡姆·芬奇住的，还有一间留给作客的亲戚朋友用。卧室都很简朴，但是只有一个楼悌通向女孩子住的卧室，去威尔卡姆的卧室和客人的卧室只能走另一个楼梯。女孩子房间的楼梯是从楼下父母的卧室通上去的，所以，西蒙随时知道女孩子们夜间进出的时间。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a kitchen separate from the rest of the house, tacked onto it by a wooden catwalk; in the back yard was a rusty bell on a pole, used to summon field hands or as a distress signal; a widow's walk was on the roof, but no widows walked there -- from it, Simon oversaw his overseer, watched the river-boats, and gazed into the lives of surrounding landholders.</div>

<div class="line_en">There went with the house the usual legend about the Yankees: one Finch female, recently engaged, donned her complete trousseau to save it from raiders in the neighborhood; she became stuck in the door to the Daughters' Staircase but was doused with water and finally pushed through. When we arrived at the Landing, Aunt Alexandra kissed Uncle Jack, Francis kissed Uncle Jack, Uncle Jimmy shook hands silently with Uncle Jack, Jem and I gave our presents to Francis, who gave us a present. Jem felt his age and gravitated to the adults, leaving me to entertain our cousin. Francis was eight and slicked back his hair.</div>

As he lived in Mobile, he could not inform on me to school authorities, but he managed to tell everything he knew to Aunt Alexandra, who in turn unburdened herself to Atticus, who either forgot it or gave me hell, whichever struck his fancy.

<div class="line_en">Aunt Alexandra was fanatical on the subject of my attire. I could not possibly hope to be a lady if I wore breeches; when I said I could do nothing in a dress, she said I wasn't supposed to be doing things that required pants. Aunt Alexandra's vision of my deportment involved playing with small stoves, tea sets, and wearing the Add-A-Pearl necklace she gave me when I was born; furthermore, I should be a ray of sunshine in my father's lonely life. I suggested that one could be a ray of sunshine in pants just as well, but Aunty said that one had to behave like a sunbeam, that I was born good but had grown progressively worse every year. She hurt my feelings and set my teeth permanently on edge, but when I asked Atticus about it, he said there were already enough sunbeams in the family and to go on about my business, he didn't mind me much the way I was.</div>

<div class="line_en">At Christmas dinner, I sat at the little table in the diningroom; Jem and Francis sat with the adults at the dining table. Aunty had continued to isolate me long after Jem and Francis graduated to the big table. I often wondered what she thought I'd do, get up and throw something? I sometimes thought of asking her if she would let me sit at the big table with the rest of them just once, I would prove to her how civilized I could be; after all, I ate at home every day with no major mishaps. When I begged Atticus to use his influence, he said he had none -- we were guests, and we sat where she told us to sit. He also said Aunt Alexandra didn't understand girls much, she'd never had one.</div>
