<div class="line_en">I clap my hands over my mouth, but the sound has already escaped. The sky goes black and I hear a chorus of frogs begin to sing. Stupid! I tell myself. What a stupid thing to do! I wait, frozen, for the woods to come alive with assailants. Then I remember there's almost no one left.</div>

<div class="line_en">Peeta, who's been wounded, is now my ally. Whatever doubts I've had about him dissipate because if either of us took the other's life now we'd be pariahs when we returned to District 12. In fact, I know if I was watching I'd loathe any tribute who didn't immediately ally with their district partner. Besides, it just makes sense to protect each other. And in my case -- being one of the star-crossed lovers from District 12 -- it's an absolute requirement if I want any more help from sympathetic sponsors.</div>

<div class="line_en">The star-crossed lovers… Peeta must have been playing that angle all along. Why else would the Gamemakers have made this unprecedented change in the rules? For two tributes to have a shot at winning, our "romance" must be so popular with the audience that condemning it would jeopardize the success of the Games. No thanks to me. All I've done is managed not to kill Peeta. But whatever he's done in the arena, he must have the audience convinced it was to keep me alive. Shaking his head to keep me from running to the Cornucopia. Fighting Cato to let me escape. Even hooking up with the Careers must have been a move to protect me. Peeta, it turns out, has never been a danger to me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="明星恋人…皮塔肯定一直在扮演这个天使的角色。否则人赛组织者干吗要改变规则？就为了让两个选手在胜利时同时亮相。我们的浪漫故事肯定在观众中广为流传；诅咒它，就等于威胁比赛的成功。不用感谢我，我所做的一切就是尽量避免杀死皮塔；但他的所作所为都使观众相信一切都是为了保住我的性命。在我要跑向宙斯之角时，他摇头；他与加图斗争，让我逃跑；甚至和职业选手混在一起也是为了保护我。事实证明，皮塔从未对我构成威胁。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So, who is there left to be afraid of? Foxface? The boy tribute from her district is dead. She's operating alone, at night. And her strategy has been to evade, not attack. I don't really think that, even if she heard my voice, she'd do anything but hope someone else would kill me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那么，剩下的人中，哪一个是应该感到害怕的？狐狸脸？他们区来的男孩已经死了，夜晚，她只有孤独一人，她现在的策略应该是避让，而非进攻。我想，就算她现在听到我的声音，也并不希望有人把我杀死。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So that leaves Cato and the girl from District 2, who are now surely celebrating the new rule. They're the only ones left who benefit from it besides Peeta and myself. Do I run from them now, on the chance they heard me call Peeta's name? No, I think. Let them come. Let them come with their night-vision glasses and their heavy, branch-breaking bodies. Right into the range of my arrows. But I know they won't. If they didn't come in daylight to my fire, they won't risk what could be another trap at night. When they come, it will be on their own terms, not because I've let them know my whereabouts.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那么，就还剩下加图和二区的女孩，他们一定在为新规则额手称庆，他们是除了皮塔和我外受益于新规则的选手。怕他们万一听到我喊皮塔的名字，我应该赶快逃脱他们的追捕吗？“不，”我想，“让他们来吧。”让他们戴着夜视镜，拖着沉重的、会压断树枝的身躯来吧，直接来到我弓箭的射程内。可我知道他们不会，如果白天看到火堆不会来，那么晚上害怕落入圈套，他们更不会冒险。因此，他们就算来也完全是自己的决定，而非我暴露了行踪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then there's Thresh. All right, he's a distinct threat. But I haven't seen him, not once, since the Games began. I think about how Foxface grew alarmed when she heard a sound at the site of the explosion. But she didn't turn to the woods, she turned to whatever lies across from it. To that area of the arena that drops off into I don't know what. I feel almost certain that the person she ran from was Thresh and that is his domain. He'd never have heard me from there and, even if he did, I'm up too high for someone his size to reach.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那么还有萨里什，好吧，他是严重的威胁，可自从比赛开始以来，我从没见过他，一次都没有。我想起狐狸脸在爆炸后听到声音立刻警觉起来，可她并没有跑向丛林，而是向相反方向跑，朝竞技场我不熟悉的方向跑，我感觉很肯定，她要躲的人就是萨里什，而那是他的领地，他在那里永远都不可能听到我的声音，即使听到，我爬得这么高，他那种身量的人也上不来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I do sleep, but in the morning I'm extra-cautious, thinking that while the Careers might hesitate to attack me in a tree, they're completely capable of setting an ambush for me. I make sure to fully prepare myself for the day -- eating a big breakfast, securing my pack, readying my weapons -- before I descend. But all seems peaceful and undisturbed on the ground.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我睡着了。早晨醒来时，我更小心谨慎。如果其他人不会在树上进攻我，他们完全可以在地面设下埋伏。我要确保自己已为白天的搏杀做好一切准备，吃饱早饭，检查好背包，准备好武器，然后才下树。但地面上似乎静悄悄的，一切平安。">查看中文翻译</div>

If he's as badly wounded as Cato thinks, I'd be in the position of having to defend us both without any assistance. But if he's that incapacitated, how has he managed to stay alive? And how on earth will I find him?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="今天我一定要极为小心。职业选手会知道我要找到皮塔，他们会在我行动之后再伺机出动。如果皮塔真如加图所说受了重伤，那我就要在没有任何帮助的情况下保护我们两个人。如果皮塔身受重伤，他又是怎么活下来的呢？我如何才能找到他呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I try to think of anything Peeta ever said that might give me an indication as to where he's hiding out, but nothing rings a bell. So I go back to the last moment I saw him sparkling in the sunlight, yelling at me to run. Then Cato appeared, his sword drawn. And after I was gone, he wounded Peeta. But how did Peeta get away? Maybe he'd held out better against the tracker jacker poison than Cato. Maybe that was the variable that allowed him to escape. But he'd been stung, too. So how far could he have gotten, stabbed and filled with venom? And how has he stayed alive all these days since? If the wound and the stingers haven't killed him, surely thirst would have taken him by now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我极力回忆那晚皮塔说过的话，好找到皮塔藏身的蛛丝马迹，可一点线索也没有。所以我又回想他在阳光下满脸都是亮晶晶水滴、冲我大喊“快跑”时的情形。皮塔对我说完话，之后加图出现，手里拿着刀，我跑掉之后，他就刺伤了皮塔。可皮塔怎么逃走的？也许他被黄蜂蜇伤后比加图的情况要好，也许只是凭运气逃脱了，可是他也被蜇伤了，他在被刺伤、体内还有蜂毒的情况下又能跑出多远呢？此后的许多天他又是怎样设法活下来的？如果他的伤和蜂毒没有令他丧命的话，肯定他也快要渴死了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And that's when I get my first clue to his whereabouts. He couldn't have survived without water. I know that from my first few days here. He must be hidden somewhere near a source. There's the lake, but I find that an unlikely option since it's so close to the Careers' base camp. A few spring-fed pools. But you'd really be a sitting duck at one of those. And the stream. The one that leads from the camp Rue and I made all the way down near the lake and beyond. If he stuck to the stream, he could change his location and always be near water. He could walk in the current and erase any tracks. He might even be able to get a fish or two.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="想到这儿，我找到了第一个线索。没有水，他无法存活，开始几天，我也如此。他一定藏在靠近水源的地方。是湖边，川继而我又觉得这不可能，因为那样的话，离职业选手的营地人近了。再不就是竞技场的几口泉眼，这无异于坐以待毙。那就只有小溪了，那条经过我和露露的栖息地，一直流经湖边，再奔向远处的小溪。如果他一直靠近小溪，他就会始终靠近水源，而又可以不停地变换位置。他可以在溪流中走动而不会留下任何印记，他甚至可以抓到一些鱼吃。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">To confuse my enemies' minds, I start a fire with plenty of green wood. Even if they think it's a ruse, I hope they'll decide I'm hidden somewhere near it. While in reality, I'll be tracking Peeta.</div>

<div class="line_en">The sun burns off the morning haze almost immediately and I can tell the day will be hotter than usual. The water's cool and pleasant on my bare feet as I head downstream. I'm tempted to call out Peeta's name as I go but decide against it. I will have to find him with my eyes and one good ear or he will have to find me. But he'll know I'll be looking, right? He won't have so low of an opinion of me as to think I'd ignore the new rule and keep to myself. Would he? He's very hard to predict, which might be interesting under different circumstances, but at the moment only provides an extra obstacle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="炙热的阳光很快驱散了晨雾，我知道今天一定比平时还热。我在小溪中顺溪流而下，溪水没过我的脚，感觉凉凉的，很舒服。我开始想喊皮塔的名字，但又觉得不妥。我要用眼睛和一只好耳朵找到他，或者他发现我。但他应该知道我在找他，对吧？他不会小看我，认为我置新规则于不顾，只会明哲保身吧？他的心思挺难猜的，要在平时，猜测他的心思挺有趣，可现在猜错了就不容易找到他了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Hugging the rocks, I move slowly in the direction of the blood, searching for him. I find a few more bloodstains, one with a few threads of fabric glued to it, but no sign of life. I break down and say his name in a hushed voice. "Peeta! Peeta!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="绕着这块石头，我沿着血迹寻找皮塔，我又看到更多的血迹，在一摊血上还粘着些布丝，但没有皮塔的踪迹。我继续朝前走，小声喊着皮塔的名字。“皮塔！皮塔！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It doesn't take long to reach the spot where I peeled off to go to the Careers' camp. There's been no sign of Peeta, but this doesn't surprise me. I've been up and down this stretch three times since the tracker jacker incident. If he were nearby, surely I'd have had some suspicion of it. The stream begins to curve to the left into a part of the woods that's new to me. Muddy banks covered in tangled water plants lead to large rocks that increase in size until I begin to feel somewhat trapped. It would be no small matter to escape the stream now. Fighting off Cato or Thresh as I climbed over this rocky terrain. In fact, I've just about decided I'm on the wrong track entirely, that a wounded boy would be unable to navigate getting to and from this water source, when I see the bloody streak going down the curve of a boulder. It's long dried now, but the smeary lines running side to side suggest someone -- who perhaps was not fully in control of his mental faculties -- tried to wipe it away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我很快就到了远离溪流，通往职业选手营地的分岔道，但没有皮塔的踪迹，这也在意料之中。从黄蜂蜇人的事发生后，我在这条路上来来回回已经走过三次了。如果他就在附近，我会有感觉。溪流向左流向一片我不熟悉的林地，湿滑泥泞的岸边生长着许多盘根错节的水生植物，沿河岸向前出现了一块大石头，越往前走，石头越大，前面的路似乎已经不通了，从溪流的这个方向逃走，乱石林立，还要防备加图和萨里什的袭击，肯定很不容易，一个受伤的人不可能走这条路线，我觉得走的方向肯定不对，这时却看到在大石头的转弯处有血迹。血迹早已干了，从模糊的印记上可以判断，有人在大脑不完全听从支配的情况下，曾试图把地上的血迹擦掉。">查看中文翻译</div>

But when I start to help him to the stream, all the levity disappears. It's only two feet away, how hard can it be? Very hard when I realize he's unable to move an inch on his own. He's so weak that the best he can do is not to resist. I try to drag him, but despite the fact that I know he's doing all he can to keep quiet, sharp cries of pain escape him. The mud and plants seem to have imprisoned him and I finally have to give a gigantic tug to break him from their clutches.

<div class="line_en">I've got two water bottles and Rue's water skin. I prop them against rocks in the stream so that two are always filling while I pour the third over Peeta's body. It takes a while, but I finally get rid of enough mud to find his clothes. I gently unzip his jacket, unbutton his shirt and ease them off him. His undershirt is so plastered into his wounds I have to cut it away with my knife and drench him again to work it loose. He's badly bruised with a long burn across his chest and four tracker jacker stings, if you count the one under his ear. But I feel a bit better. This much I can fix. I decide to take care of his upper body first, to alleviate some pain, before I tackle whatever damage Cato did to his leg.</div>

He sits there, uncomplaining, while I wash away all the traces of dirt from his hair and skin. His flesh is very pale in the sunlight and he no longer looks strong and stocky. I have to dig the stingers out of his tracker jacker lumps, which causes him to wince, but the minute I apply the leaves he sighs in relief. While he dries in the sun, I wash his filthy shirt and jacket and spread them over boulders. Then I apply the burn cream to his chest. This is when I notice how hot his skin is becoming. The layer of mud and the bottles of water have disguised the fact that he's burning with fever. I dig through the first-aid kit I got from the boy from District 1 and find pills that reduce your temperature. My mother actually breaks down and buys these on occasion when her home remedies fail.</div>
