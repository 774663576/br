<div class="line_en">The air was rent by a scream that sounded like Voldemort's when he had realized the cup had been stolen: It tore at every nerve in Harry's body, and he knew immediately that their appearance had caused it. Even as he looked at the other two beneath the Cloak, the door of the Three Broomsticks burst open and a dozen cloaked and hooded Death Eaters dashed into the street, their wands aloft.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一声尖叫划破了夜空，听着像伏地魔发现金杯被盗时的喊叫，这声音折磨着哈利全身的神经，他立刻明白了这是他们引起的。就在他看着隐形衣下的另外两个人时，三把扫帚的门突然打开，十几个穿斗篷、戴兜帽的食死徒高举着魔杖冲到了街上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry's feet touched road. He saw the achingly familiar Hogsmeade High Street: dark shop fronts, and the outline of black mountains beyond the village, and the curve in the road ahead that led off toward Hogwarts, and light spilling from the windows of the Three Broomsticks, and with a lurch of the heart he remembered, with piercing accuracy, how he had landed here nearly a year before, supporting a desperately weak Dumbledore; all this in a second, upon landing -- and then, even as he relaxed his grip upon Ron's and Hermione's arms, it happened.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利的脚触到了路面。他看见了熟悉得令他心痛的霍格莫德大街：漆黑的店面，村外远处黑黢黢的群山轮廓，前方通往霍格沃茨的弯道，还有三把扫帚酒吧窗户里透出的灯光。他的心猛地抽搐了一下，想起就在差不多一年前，他搀扶着奄奄一息的邓布利多降落在这里，那一幕情景如刀割一般逼真。所有这些都是在降落的一瞬间感到的——就在他松开罗恩和赫敏的胳膊时，出事了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry seized Ron's wrist as he raised his wand; there were too many of them to Stun: Even attempting it would give away their position. One of the Death Eaters waved his wand and the scream stopped, still echoing around the distant mountains.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗恩举起魔杖，哈利一把抓住他的手腕。敌人太多，不能使用昏迷咒，就连试一试都会暴露他们的方位。一个食死徒挥了挥魔杖，尖叫声停止了，但仍在远处的群山间回荡不绝。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Six of the Death Eaters ran toward them: Harry, Ron, and Hermione backed as quickly as possible down the nearest side street, and the Death Eaters missed them by inches. They waited in the darkness, listening to the footsteps running up and down, beams of light flying along the street from the Death Eaters' searching wands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="六七个食死徒朝他们跑来，哈利、罗恩和赫敏迅速后退，拐进了最后的一条小街，仅差几英寸就被他们撞上了。他们在黑暗中等待着，听着脚步声跑过来跑过去，食死徒举着魔杖搜寻，一道道魔杖的光在街上穿梭扫射。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Even as she said it, he felt the unnatural cold begin to steal over the street. Light was sucked from the environment right up to the stars, which vanished. In the pitch-blackness, he felt Hermione take hold of his arm and together, they turned on the spot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她话音没落，哈利就感到一股不同寻常的寒意从街上袭来。四周的灯光都被吸走了，就连星星也消失了。在伸手不见五指的黑暗中，他感到赫敏抓住了他的胳膊，他们一起原地旋转。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The air through which they needed to move seemed to have become solid: They could not Disapparate; the Death Eaters had cast their charms well. The cold was biting deeper and deeper into Harry's flesh. He, Ron, and Hermione retreated down the side street, groping their way along the wall, trying not to make a sound. Then, around the corner, gliding noiselessly, came dementors, ten or more of them, visible because they were of a denser darkness than their surroundings, with their black cloaks and their scabbed and rotting hands. Could they sense fear in the vicinity? Harry was sure of it: They seemed to be coming more quickly now, taking those dragging, rattling breaths he detested, tasting despair on the air, closing in --</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="需要穿越的空气似乎变成了坚实的固体：他们不能幻影移形了。食死徒的魔咒还真厉害。寒意一点一点地渗透进哈利的肌肤。他和罗恩、赫敏在小街上一步一步后退，顺着墙壁摸索，尽量不发出一点声音。接着，摄魂怪在街角出现了，有十多个，无声无息地飘移过来。他之所以能看得到它们，是因为它们黑色的斗篷、结痂腐烂的手比周围的黑暗更加深浓。它们能感觉到附近的恐惧吗？哈利知道肯定能。它们现在似乎移动得更快了，发出令他憎恶的那种又长又慢、咯咯作响的呼吸声，品尝着空气里的绝望，围拢了过来——">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry had had no idea where they were, but now he saw, by the stuttering light of a single candle, the grubby, sawdust-strewn bar of the Hog's Head Inn. They ran behind the counter and through a second doorway, which led to a rickety wooden staircase that they climbed as fast as they could. The stairs opened onto a sitting room with a threadbare carpet and a small fireplace, above which hung a single large oil painting of a blonde girl who gazed out at the room with a kind of vacant sweetness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利刚才不知道他们身在何处，此刻在一根孤零零的蜡烛摇曳的微光下，他看见了猪头酒吧那破烂肮脏、散着锯末的吧台。他们跑到柜台后面，又穿过一扇门，那里有一道摇摇晃晃的木头楼梯，他们尽快爬了上去。楼梯顶上是客厅，铺着破旧的地毯，还有个小小的壁炉，壁炉上方挂着一幅很大的油画，画上是一个金发的姑娘茫然而温柔地望着屋内。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="摄魂怪退去了，星星又开始眨动眼睛，食死徒的脚步声越来越响。情急之下，哈利一时不知如何应对。就在这时，旁边传来门闩吱吱嘎嘎的声音，小街左侧的一扇门打开了，一个粗暴的声音说：“波特，快进来，快！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A tiny white dot had reappeared at the end of the painted tunnel, and now Ariana was walking back toward them, growing bigger and bigger as she came. But there was somebody else with her now, someone taller than she was, who was limping along, looking excited. His hair was longer than Harry had ever seen it: He appeared to have suffered several gashes to his face and his clothes were ripped and torn. Larger and larger the two figures grew, until only their heads and shoulders filled the portrait. Then the whole thing swung forward on the wall like a little door, and the entrance to a real tunnel was revealed. And out of it, his hair overgrown, his face cut, his robes ripped, clambered the real Neville Longbottom, who gave a roar of delight, leapt down from the mantelpiece, and yelled, "I knew you'd come! I knew it, Harry!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个小白点在画中的隧道尽头出现了，阿利安娜朝他们走了回来，越来越近，越来越大。但她身边还有一个人，个子比她高，走路一瘸一拐的，满脸的兴奋。他的头发比哈利以前见过的任何时候都长，脸上似乎划了几道口子，衣服也被撕扯得不像样子。两个人影越来越大，最后他们的脑袋和肩膀占满了整个肖像。这时墙上的肖像如同一扇小门一样打开了，露出一条真正的隧道的入口。真正的纳威·隆巴顿从隧道里爬出来，头发长得出奇，满脸伤痕，长袍被扯烂了。他狂喜地大吼一声，从壁炉台上跳了下来，嚷道：“我知道你会来！我早就知道，哈利！”">查看中文翻译</div>
