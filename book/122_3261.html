<div class="line_en">"Godbye, old man," called Davies, as the ferry pulled slowly out of Norderney. He looked tired and depressed as he waved goodbye to me, and I was only half awake myself. It was Davies who had woken me, fed me, and packed my bag with motherly care. We had not had time to discuss any further plans, except that he should expect my return on about the 26th, the day after the Germans" meeting.</div>

<div class="line_en">As the day passed, however, I began to feel fresher, and was able to think more clearly. Today was the 23rd, so I had very little time to reach London, find out about Dollmann, and return in time for the meeting on the 25th. I began to imagine how it would be in London -- trying to persuade people in government offices of the urgency of my enquiries. Oh, will you leave a note, sir? Or come back next week to see Mr So-and-So? People are cautious, unwilling to give out information unless they are forced to. And the Navy!</div>

<div class="line_en">But I was too sleepy to concentrate fully, and I slept for most of the train journey that followed our arrival at Norddeich, only waking up twice. The first time was at Emden, where Böhme and I had to change trains, and I heard someone talking to him about canals. The second was at Leer station, when Böhme woke me to say goodbye. "Don't forget to do your investigating in London!" he cried, smiling falsely.</div>

<div class="line_en">I found a pleasant hotel, and slept for ten hours in a huge, luxurious bed. Early next morning, I was on a train travelling back the way I had come, wearing some old seaman's clothes, which I had bought from a second-hand clothes shop. I was now an ordinary English seaman, going to Emden to join his ship.</div>

<div class="line_en">Another thought. How sure was I of Davies's safety while I was away? Might they offer to take him to Memmert, put him in a diving-suit, cut off the air -- Stop, that was nonsense! But I had already decided there was no point in returning to London. Instead, I would go as far as Amsterdam, to change my clothes and identity, and sleep just one night in a comfortable bed. Then I would go back to Friesland to look for more clues, and try to solve the riddle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="另一个念头。我离开这段时间，戴维斯的安全有多大保证？他们会不会提出带他去梅默尔特岛，让他穿上潜水服，然后切断氧气——停，别胡思乱想了！但我已经想通，回伦敦没有意义，我会改为坐到阿姆斯特丹就下车，改换装束、身份，接着找张舒服的床睡一晚，然后就回弗里斯兰寻找更多线索，争取解开谜题。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">All day, as I was carried through the Dutch and German countryside, I puzzled over the clues we had gathered. Davies was probably right, and Norden was the place for the meeting on the 25th. "The tide will be right," they had said at Memmert, and high tide was between 10.30 and 11 p. m. My train timetable told me there was a "night train", too, leaving at 7.43 p. m, and stopping at all the villages east of Norden. I determined to be at Norden in time for the meeting, and until then, I would find out all I could about Friesland, and Esens in particular.</div>

<div class="line_en">In Esens, I walked around in the evening light and discovered several interesting things. A lot of work was being done there, on developing the Bensersiel stream into a canal. I also saw a long, low building, rather like buildings I had seen on Memmert, where barges were being built. I climbed into one of the barges to inspect it more closely, and realized that it was designed not only for canal work, but also for rough water.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="借着夜晚的灯光，我逛了逛埃森斯，得到好几个有趣的发现。这里正在进行大规模的工程，把贝瑟西尔的小河改造成运河。我还看到一座低矮、狭长的建筑，跟我在梅默尔特岛看到的那些制造驳船的厂房很像。我爬进一艘驳船仔细察看，发现这些船的设计不仅适合运河，还适合在波涛汹涌的海面航行。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At Emden, I bought a ticket to Esens. The train crossed a big canal, which I realized was the Ems-Jade Canal, connecting Emden and Wilhelmshaven, and deep enough to carry gunboats. I looked again at my map of the area. Esens was six kilometres inland from Bensersiel, and a stream ran all the way from Bensersiel to join the Esens-Wittmund Canal. I suddenly remembered the numbers I had heard at Memmert. Perhaps they were the depths of water in canals! The conversation I had heard at Emden station also came back to me, and I felt sure that Böhme was a canal engineer. Was I getting somewhere at last?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我在埃姆登买了张去埃森斯的票。火车驶过一条大运河，我意识到这就是埃姆斯—亚德运河。这条运河连通着埃姆登和威廉港，水深足够炮艇航行。我又看了看这片区域的地图。贝瑟西尔再往内陆六公里就是埃森斯，一条小河从贝瑟西尔流出，一直注入埃森斯—维特蒙德运河。我突然记起在梅默尔特岛听到的数字，它们也许是运河的水深！我又想起在埃姆登火车站听到的对话，可以肯定博默是个运河 工程师。我是不是终于抓到重点了？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The next day was the 25th. In the morning I studied the map again and realized how much I had to explore. There were six more villages like Esens and six more harbours like Bensersiel round the coast, and perhaps these matched Böhme's seven letters, A to G. All seven harbours had channels going through the sands to the open sea, and all seven were connected by a stream or canal to an inland village.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天就是25号。早上我又研究了一下地图，意识到我还有很多东西需要弄清楚。这一带沿海还有六座埃森斯这样的村庄，六个贝瑟西尔这样的港口，也许这些正好对应着博默说的A到G七个字母。七个港口各有一条航道穿过沙洲、连接公海，又各有一条小河或运河连通内陆的一座村庄。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I spent the whole day walking round Friesland. This time I took the identity of a German seaman, and talked to local people, to find out more. I was only suspected of being English once, but that nearly got me into serious trouble. Luckily, however, I managed to get the man drunk and escape from him. But it made me more aware of the danger I was in, so after that I avoided roads and villages, and walked across fields and through streams. Everywhere I went, I discovered that work was going on; all the streams were close to becoming canals, and solid, good quality barges were being built in large numbers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一整天我都在弗里斯兰四处逛。这次我假装是个德国水手，通过跟当地人聊天了解更多信息。只有一次我被人怀疑是英国人，但就是那一次，差点给我造成大麻烦。所幸我想办法把那人灌醉，然后从他身边溜掉了。但这件事让我更加意识到自己的危险处境，之后我就避开大路和村庄，在田野和小河之间穿行。我发现所到之处都在大兴土木，所有的小河差不多都变成了运河，还建造了大量结实耐用的驳船。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">By now it was midnight, and as there was no one around, I decided to spend the night on the barge. The cold wooden boards brought back the memory of my soft hotel bed, but a spy can't expect luxury every night. At least there was more room to move than on the Dulcibella.</div>

<div class="line_en">At Esens station, I got out first, and waited in the darkness for the three men to pass. They walked on together, away from the coast and towards the canal. I did not follow them, as I felt sure they would appear at Bensersiel very soon, so I walked quickly to the harbour. There I waited for an uneasy hour, looking at the barges lying at anchor, and wondering if I had guessed wrongly about their plans.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在埃森斯车站，我先下了车，在暗处等那三个人经过。他们一起走过来，往远离海岸、靠近运河的方向走去。我没有跟着他们，因为我确信他们很快就会出现在贝瑟西尔，便快步朝港口走去。我在那里忐忑不安地等了一小时，看着停靠的驳船，怀疑自己是否猜错了他们的计划。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At 7.15 in the evening, I arrived, very tired, at Norden station, for the meeting I hoped would take place there. I was delighted to see von Brüning there already. He did not notice me in my dirty seaman's clothes, and I heard him ask for a ticket to Esens. I bought one, too, and we both got on the 7.43 train. At the last minute, I saw two late arrivals, whom I did not recognize, jump on. A whistle blew, and the train rolled slowly out of the station.</div>

<div class="line_en">Suddenly I saw the lights of a tug coming into the small harbour. It was Grimm at the helm, with a crew of two seamen. He left them in charge while he jumped on to the shore, and disappeared in the direction of the canal.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然，我看到一艘亮着灯的拖船驶进这个小港口。掌舵的是格林，船上有两名水手。他让水手看船，自己跳到岸上，消失在去往运河的方向。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Soon after, the sailors hurried back, followed by Grimm. The engine started, and the tug moved slowly away, and then stopped. I heard footsteps from the direction of the canal, and three people jumped on to the deck. We were off again, and this time the tug seemed to be pulling something. What was it? A barge, of course! I had seen one, half-loaded with bricks, lying near the tug in the harbour. (Then I remembered the words from Memmert: "Only one, with half a load.")</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不久，两个水手又赶了回来，后面跟着格林。引擎发动了，拖船缓缓驶离原处，接着又停了下来。我听到有脚步声从运河那边传来，有三个人跳上了甲板。船又开动了，这一次拖船似乎在拖着什么。是什么呢？当然是驳船了！我之前就在港口看到一艘驳船，装了半船的砖，停在拖船附近。（这时，我想起在梅默尔特岛听到的话：“就一只，装半满。”）">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I knew I had to get on board somehow -- it was the only way I could follow them -- but how? Fortunately for me, the sailors seemed very interested in the brightly lit pub, and after a short discussion, they tied up the tug, and hurried towards it. This was my chance, and I took it. As soon as they had gone, I ran across the mud, and climbed on board. The only place I could find to hide was the dinghy, which hung over the side of the tug, tied on with thick ropes. I was too excited to be anxious about what might happen if I was discovered, and I hid myself carefully at the bottom of the little boat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我知道我得想办法上船——这是跟踪他们的唯一方式——可是怎么上船呢？所幸两个水手似乎对灯火通明的小酒馆很感兴趣，他们讨论了几句，就把拖船拴在岸边，急匆匆朝酒馆走去。我没有错过这个机会。他们刚走，我就跑过泥地，爬上拖船。我能找到的唯一藏身之处，就是用粗绳子拴在船舷外侧的小艇。我太激动了，根本来不及去想如果被抓到会怎样，便小心地藏在了小艇底部。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Cautiously, I looked over the edge of the dinghy, and realized we were travelling west, towards Norderney, or Memmert, perhaps. I was perfectly safe, but only until the dinghy was needed. Grimm was steering, and the three passengers were standing at the back of the tug, watching the barge moving smoothly behind us. I recognized tall, bearded von Brüning, and short, fat Böhme, and the third man must be he who "insists on coming". I was almost sure I knew who he was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我小心翼翼地从小艇边缘向外望，意识到船正在向西行驶，去诺德奈，也有可能是去梅默尔特岛。我的处境很安全，不过前提是他们用不到小艇。格林负责掌舵，三位乘客则站在拖船尾部，望着后方平稳前进的驳船。我认出了高个子、蓄胡须的冯布吕宁，还有矮胖的博默。第三个人肯定就是“坚持要来”的那一个，我觉得我差不多能猜到他是谁。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now the tug moved northwards, aiming for the channel between Langeoog and Baltrum. We were taking the open sea route, as the tide was falling, and it would be impossible to cross the sandbanks in the dark. Once through the channel, I expected us to turn west towards Norderney, but we carried on out to sea, where the water was a good deal rougher. After a while, the tug began to turn, and made one complete circle, though for what purpose I had no idea. The behaviour of the three passengers was also puzzling. They spent all the time watching, and clearly talking about, the barge behind us. Finally, we turned west again, in the direction of Memmert.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此时拖船向北航行，准备进入朗格奥格和贝尔特鲁姆之间的一条航道。我们走的是公海航线，因为这时是落潮，在黑暗中没法穿过沙洲地带。走完这条航道，我以为该往西去诺德奈了，结果船继续驶向公海，而且这一带海浪要大得多。过了一会儿拖船开始转弯，绕了整整一圈。我猜不透这样走的目的，而三位乘客的举动也让人不解。他们全程一直望着后方的驳船，显然也一直在谈论它。最后拖船转向西，朝梅默尔特岛驶去。">查看中文翻译</div>

But bit by bit, the pieces of the puzzle fell into place, and I had solved the riddle at last.</div>

<div class="line_en">And then at last I understood. This was the way to England too. What I had just witnessed was a rehearsal for an invasion. This trial trip was designed to show how tugs could pull seagoing barges carrying soldiers and their weapons -- hundreds of barges, carrying thousands of soldiers. This army would gather, not in some great naval harbour, but on an unimportant piece of coast, hidden behind the sandbanks of the Frisian Islands, where nobody would expect an invasion to start from. The barges would be brought down the canals to seven tiny harbours, and when the tide was right, the tugs would pull them through the channels that led between the islands to the open sea. And on to England -- and its undefended east coast.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时我终于懂了。这也是去英国的路 啊。我目睹的是一次侵略预演。这次试航是为了演示拖船如何牵引载着士兵和武器的海上驳船——几百艘驳船，载着成千上万名士兵。这支军队的集结地不是哪个重要的军港，而是隐藏在弗里西亚群岛沙洲后面的一段无足轻重的海岸。没有人能想到侵略会从这里发起。拖船会沿着运河把驳船拖进七个小港口，等潮汐合适的时候，再拖着它们穿过连接岛屿和公海的航道，驶向英国——驶向其未加防守的东海岸。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I was still lost in these thoughts when the tug passed Norderney town and turned south. We were taking the narrow channel to Norddeich, where the passengers would probably land, and I would very likely be discovered in my hiding-place. Somehow I had to escape. Only a kilometre away was the Dulcibella and Davies, if he were safe. What would he do in this situation? The tide was falling, and we were crossing the sandbanks…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拖船经过诺德奈镇，掉头向南，这时我还沉浸在思绪中。船正沿着狭窄的航道向诺德代希驶去，乘客们大概会在那里下船，而我的藏身之处也很可能被发现。我得想办法逃走。如果戴维斯还安全的话，他和“达尔茜贝拉”号应该就在一公里外。在这种情况下他 会怎么做呢？潮水正在退去，我们正在沙洲间穿行……">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A wild idea came to me. I looked quickly at my watch, by the light of a match. It was 2.30 a. m. Low tide would be about 5 o'clock. The tug would be aground until about 7.30 a. m, not in any danger, but safely out of the way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我脑海里闪过一个疯狂的念头。我借着一根火柴的光亮，迅速看了看表。此时是凌晨2点半，退潮时间是5点前后。拖船应该会搁浅到7点半左右，这期间不会有任何危险，也完全妨碍不到我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Grimm was below, in the cabin with his three passengers, while one of the crew was at the helm, with his back to me. Grimm and I were about the same height, and he had left his coat at the top of the ladder down to the cabin. I climbed very quietly out of the dinghy, put on his coat, and pulled my hat down to hide my face. Confidently I walked up to the helmsman, and touched him on the arm, as I had seen Grimm do earlier. The man, used to such commands from his silent captain, moved obediently away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="格林和他的三位乘客在下面船舱里，一个船员背朝我在开船。格林和我身高差不多，他的外套又落在了通往船舱的梯子顶端。我蹑手蹑脚爬出小艇，穿上格林的外套，把帽子压低挡住脸，镇定自若地走到舵手身边，碰了碰他的胳膊——之前我见过格林这样做。舵手习惯了沉默寡言的船长这样指示手下，便乖乖走开了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">My plan developed beautifully. I took the helm, and kept the tug in the channel, between the buoys, until I felt the moment had come. Then I suddenly turned the wheel as hard as I could to the right. The seaman shouted a warning, but he was too late. The tug crashed into the sandbank at full speed, and the wheel went stiff in my hands. We were aground.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="计划进行得天衣无缝。我握住舵轮，让拖船一直在浮标之间的航道里航行，直到觉得时机到了，便用尽力气把舵轮猛地向右扳。水手大喊着要我当心，可是已经太迟了。拖船全速撞到了沙洲上，舵轮在我手中停了下来。船搁浅了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I think it is safe to say that I was the only one on board who behaved with calmness and common sense in the minutes that followed. Grimm was on deck in seconds, shouting angrily at his crew, and the passengers soon joined in. The wind, darkness and rain made the confusion worse. Unnoticed, I threw off Grimm's coat, and ran back to the dinghy. On the way, I bumped into the unknown passenger -- "he who insists". He thought I was one of Grimm's men, and offered to help me. I saw his face close up, and realized immediately that my earlier suspicion was correct. The leader of the country can, after all, insist on what he likes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我想可以肯定地说，在接下来的几分钟里，我是船上唯一一个保持冷静和理智的人。格林一转眼就上了甲板，对着船员生气地大吼，乘客们也很快跟了上来。由于当时是黑夜，又刮着风，下着雨，场面更加混乱了。我趁人不注意，脱下了格林的外套，跑回小艇旁。中途我撞到了那个不认识的乘客——“坚持要来”的那个人。他以为我是格林的手下，要帮我的忙。我看着他的脸贴近我，立刻意识到我之前的猜测是正确的。一个国家的领袖，终究是可以坚持他想做的任何事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The passenger and I cut the dinghy's ropes, and the boat hit the water with a loud splash. "Lower the boat," I heard Grimm shout, but we had already done it. I jumped in and took up the oars. The wind and tide caught me, and carried me rapidly northwards. I was very quickly out of sight of the barge, and began to row towards Norderney, with the tide. There was an outburst of shouting which soon died away. They would be held tight on the sandbank for at least five hours.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我和那位乘客割断了小艇的绳索，小艇落在海面，发出一声巨响。“放下小艇”，我听见格林在喊，可我们早就抢先一步了。我跳进小艇，拿起桨，乘着风和海潮迅速向北漂去。很快就看不到驳船的影子了。我开始顺着潮水往诺德奈划。身后响起一阵喊声，很快又归于沉寂。他们会被死死地困在沙洲上至少五个小时。">查看中文翻译</div>
