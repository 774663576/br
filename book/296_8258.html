<div class="line_en">I could not see his face or his body. He had an enormous black hat on his head, like a big box. A grey cloth came down from the hat, in front of his face. There was a hole in the cloth in front of his eyes. He could see out of the hole but I could not see in. He wore a long black coat, too. The coat began at his neck, and ended at his feet, so I could not see his arms, his body, or his legs. On his feet he wore big shoes, like old bags.</div>

<div class="line_en">So next day, at seven o'clock, I came to the shop in a cab. There were not very many people in the road, be-cause it was early in the morning. In November it is dark at seven o'clock in the morning, and I could not see the shop very well. I waited five minutes. A postman walked past. Then the door of the shop opened, and the creature, Merrick, came out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天七点钟，我乘着马车来到这家商店。天刚刚亮，路上没有多少人。十一月份的早上七点钟天还是黑的，商店还看不太清楚。我等了五分钟，一个邮递员恰好经过，后来商店门开了，那个怪物——麦里克出来了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He put one enormous foot on the first step, and then he stopped. After a minute, he moved his second foot slowly. Then he stopped and waited again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他一只大脚先迈上了头一个台阶，就停下了。过了一会儿，又慢慢地挪动另外一只脚，然后又停了下来再次等着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then I understood. There were three steps up into the cab, and he could not get up them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后来，我明白了，马车上有三级台阶，他迈不上去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，对不起，”我说，“我来帮你。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I thought quickly. "Yes. But this is a lady, not a gentleman. I'm a doctor, and she's ill. Take her hand, so I can help her better."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我灵机一动：“对，但这是位女士，不是先生。我是医生，她病了，拉着她的手，这样我能更好地帮助她。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“上车。”他大声地说，“帮我上车。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The postman took Merrick's left hand, and I helped him with two hands from behind. Slowly, very slowly, Merrick went up the steps and into the cab.</div>

<div class="line_en">I took his left hand and began to help him. My right hand was behind his back. I felt very strange. His left hand was like a young woman's, but his back under the coat, was horrible. I could feel the bags of old skin on his back under the coat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我左手拉着他的左手，右手扶着他的背帮助他上车。我觉得很奇怪，他的左手就像年轻女人的手，而他外套里面的背部却是很可怕。我可以摸到外套里面背上那些老皮囊肿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For a minute he stood by the door of the cab and said nothing. Then he hit the cab with his stick.</div>

<div class="line_en">I gave him a card with my name on. Then I thought, "That was no good. This man can't read." But Merrick took the card and looked at it very carefully. Then he put it in his trousers pocket.</div>

<div class="line_en">I did not talk to him very much at the hospital. I looked at his head and arms and legs and body very carefully. Then I wrote the important things about him in a little book. A nurse helped me. Merrick looked at her sometimes, but she did not smile at him or talk to him. I think she was afraid of him. I think Merrick was afraid too, because he was very quiet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在医院里我和他谈得不多，我很仔细地看过他的头、手臂、腿和身子，然后我将有关他的重要情况记在了一个小笔记本里。一位护士来协助我工作。麦里克时不时地朝她看看，可她既不朝他微笑也不与他说话。我想她是怕他，麦里克可能也怕她，因为他一直很安静。">查看中文翻译</div>
