<div class="line_en">He turned over in the bed, and it seemed to him there was a lighter pool of blackness on the floor nearby. He reached over and turned on the bedside lamp. The pool became the severed head of the black Madonna. He thought it had fallen off the table and the sound had brought him awake. He relaxed and smiled with relief. At that moment he heard a small rustling sound at the door. He turned toward it, and in the shadows the dim orange light of the lamp did not quite reach, he could see the dark bony face of Aspanu Pisciotta.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他在床上翻了个身，觉得附近的地板上似乎有个黑乎乎的东西。他伸手打开床头灯。原来是那颗从黑圣母雕像上砍下的头。他想它是从桌上掉下来的，是它掉在地板上的声音把他惊醒的。他松了一口气，微微一笑。就在这时候，他听见门口有窸窸窣窣的声音。他把目光转向门口，在昏暗的橙黄色灯光照不到的阴影里，他看见了阿斯帕努·皮肖塔那张黝黑瘦削的脸。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Michael was deep in sleep, then suddenly came awake. It was as if he had wrenched his body out of a pit. The bedroom was completely black; he had closed the wooden shutters to bar the pale lemon light of the moon. There was no sound, just an eerie stillness broken now by the racing of his heart. He could feel the presence of someone else in the room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔突然从酣睡中惊醒，就像拼命从深坑里挣扎着往外爬似的。卧室里一片漆黑；木条百叶窗是他拉上的，挡住了外面惨淡的月光。四周静谧无声，只有他怦怦的心跳在打破这怪异的静谧。他可以感觉到卧室里还有一个人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Michael looked at his wristwatch on the night table. It was three o'clock. "You keep strange hours -- what were you waiting for?" he asked. He got out of bed and dressed quickly, then opened the shutters. The moonlight entered the room like a ghost, appearing and disappearing. "Why didn't you wake me up?" Michael said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔看了看床头柜上的手表。凌晨三点。“你的活动时间很奇怪——你在等什么呢？”他问道。他翻身下床，迅速穿上衣服，然后打开百叶窗。月光照进房间，像幽灵似的忽隐忽现。“你刚才怎么不把我叫醒？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="一阵沉默之后，皮肖塔说：“你拿到那份遗嘱了吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes," Michael said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“拿到了。”迈克尔说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I never tell secrets," Michael said. "Not even in my dreams." He stepped out on the terrace and offered Pisciotta a cigarette. They smoked together. Michael could hear Pisciotta's chest rattle with suppressed coughs and indeed his face looked ghastly in the moonlight, the bones skeletal.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我从来就不泄密，”迈克尔说，“即使在睡梦中也不会。”他走到外面的露台上，递了一支香烟给皮肖塔。他们一同抽起烟来。迈克尔可以听见皮肖塔的胸腔发出咯咯的声音，因为他在抑制自己的咳嗽。在月光下他的脸色很难看，瘦得就像骷髅。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Pisciotta sighed. "Turi trusts me more than anyone on earth -- he trusts me with his life. I am the only person who can find him now. But he did not trust me with the Testament. Do you have it?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"The Testament is in America," Michael said. "It is safe with my father." He did not want Pisciotta to know it was on its way to Tunis simply because he did not want anyone to know.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那份遗嘱现在在美国，”迈克尔说，“在我父亲手上，很安全。”他不想让皮肖塔知道那东西正在被送往突尼斯的路上，因为他不想让任何人知道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“明天晚上，”皮肖塔回答说，“不过不是在这里。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Michael hesitated for a moment. Pisciotta laughed. "You are like Turi," he said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔有些犹豫。皮肖塔大笑起来。“你跟图里一个样。”他说道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Michael almost dreaded to ask the next question. There could be only one reason for Pisciotta to be visiting him so secretly. Only one reason he had risked evading the guards surrounding the villa: or had he been passed through? It could only be that finally Guiliano was ready to appear. "When is Guiliano coming?" he said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接下来的问题迈克尔实在不想问。皮肖塔如此神秘兮兮地来找他，只能有一个理由。他冒险躲过别墅四周的保镖，只能有一个理由；抑或是他们允许他进来的？这只能说明吉里安诺即将出现。“吉里安诺什么时候来？”他问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Why not?" Michael asked. "This is safe ground."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“为什么呢？”迈克尔问道，“这里很安全。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="皮肖塔笑着说：“可是我闯进来了，不是吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Michael was irritated by this truth. He wondered again if Pisciotta had been passed in by the guards under the order of Don Domenico, or even brought here by him. "It's for Guiliano to decide," he said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是事实，迈克尔感到恼火。他再次怀疑是唐·多梅尼克有令在先，所以保镖把他放了进来，也许是他亲自把他带进来的。“这件事还是由吉里安诺本人来决定吧。”他说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No," Pisciotta said. "I must decide for him. You promised his family he will be safe. But Don Croce knows you are here, so does Inspector Velardi. Their spies are everywhere. What do you plan for Guiliano? A wedding, a birthday party? A funeral? What kind of foolishness do you tell us? Do you think we are all donkeys here in Sicily?" He said this in a dangerous tone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，”皮肖塔说，“我必须为他作出决定。你向他的家人保证他的安全。但是唐·克罗切知道你在这里，韦拉尔迪警督也知道。到处都是他们的眼线。你为吉里安诺制订的是什么计划？结婚庆典？生日宴会？还是葬礼？你要对我们说的是什么昏话？你以为我们西西里人都是蠢驴？”他说话的语气咄咄逼人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Pisciotta laughed and said, "Spoken like a true Sicilian -- you haven't wasted the years in this country." He sighed. "I can't believe it will finally be over," he said. "Almost seven years of fighting and running, of betrayals and killing. But we were the Kings of Montelepre, Turi and myself -- there was glory enough for both of us. He was for the poor and I was for myself. I never believed at first, but in our second year as outlaws, he proved it to me and all of our band. Remember I am his second in command, his cousin, the man he trusts most. I wear the belt with the golden buckle as he does; he gave it to me. But I seduced the young daughter of a farmer in Partinico and made her pregnant. Her father went to Guiliano and told him the story. Do you know what Turi did? He tied me to a tree and beat me with a whip. Not in front of the farmer or any of our men. He would never expose me to such disrespect. It was our secret. But I knew if I disobeyed his orders again, he would kill me. That is our Turi." His hand shook as he brought it to his mouth. In the fading moonlight his tiny mustache gleamed like a thin sliver of black bone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮肖塔哈哈一笑，接着说：“说起话来真像西西里人。你在这里几年没有白过。”他叹了口气，“我认为事情并没有就此结束，”他说，“将近七年的游击和奔命、不断被出卖和不断的杀戮。不过我们曾经是蒙特莱普雷之王，图里和我——我们都有过很多辉煌。他是为穷人，而我是为自己。开始我根本不相信，在我们占山为王的第二年，他以实际行动向我和我们所有的人证明了这一点。别忘了，我是他的副手，他的表弟，是他最信任的人。我扎的皮带和他的一样，也有金带扣；这皮带还是他给我的呢。但是，我在帕尔蒂尼科诱奸了一个年轻的农家姑娘，把她肚子搞大了。她父亲找到吉里安诺告了我一状。你知道图里干了什么？他把我绑在树上用鞭子抽。当然不是当着那个农民或我们其他人的面。他绝对不会让我在他们面前出丑。这是我俩的秘密。但我知道，如果我下次再违抗他的命令，他一定会宰了我。这就是我们的图里。”他把颤悠悠的手举到嘴边。在暗淡的月光下，他的小胡子微微发亮，就像一小段黑色的骨头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm not going to tell you my plan of escape," Michael said. "You can trust me or not as you choose. Tell me where you will deliver Guiliano and I will be there. Don't tell me and tomorrow night I will be safe in America, while you and Guiliano are still running for your lives."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不打算把我的营救计划透露给你，”迈克尔说，“相不相信我，悉听尊便。告诉我你要带吉里安诺去哪儿，我就到那里去接他。如果不告诉我，那我明天晚上就安全返回美国，让你和吉里安诺继续东躲西藏吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They went back into the bedroom and Michael closed the shutters. Pisciotta picked up the severed head of the black Madonna off the floor and handed it to Michael. "I threw this on the floor to wake you," he said. "The Testament was inside, isn't that true?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们回到卧室后，迈克尔拉上百叶窗。皮肖塔从地板上捡起那颗被砍下的黑圣母的头，然后递给迈克尔。“我把这个扔在地板上来叫醒你，”他说，“那份遗嘱原本就放在这里面，是吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Pisciotta's face sagged. "Maria Lombardo lied to me. I asked her if she had it. She said no. Then she gave it to you in front of my very eyes." He laughed bitterly. "I have been like a son to her." He paused for a moment and then said, "And she has been like a mother to me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮肖塔的脸上显出萎靡的神情。“玛丽亚·隆巴尔多对我撒了谎。我问她那个东西在不在她那里，她说不在。接着她又当着我的面把它交给你。”他苦笑了一下，“对她来说，我一直像她的儿子。”他顿了顿，接着说，“我也一直把他看成自己的母亲。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔思忖，这么奇怪的事情，他告诉我干什么？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Pisciotta asked for another cigarette. There was still some wine left in the jug on the night table. Michael poured a glass for both of them, and Pisciotta drank it gratefully. "Thank you," he said. "Now we must get down to our business. I will turn over Guiliano to you outside the town of Castelvetrano. Ride in an open car so I can recognize you, and come directly on the road from Trapani. I will intercept you at a point of my own choosing. If there is danger, wear a cap and we will not appear. The time will be as soon as dawn breaks. Do you think you can manage that?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮肖塔又要了一支香烟。床头柜上的酒瓶里还剩了一些酒。迈克尔为他俩各倒了一杯，皮肖塔满怀感激地把酒喝下。“谢谢你了，”他说，“现在我们必须干正事了。我将在卡斯特尔维特拉诺镇郊外把吉里安诺交给你。你要乘坐敞篷车，这便于我认出你来，直接从特拉帕尼的公路开过来。我将在我选择的地点拦住你。如果有危险，你就带上帽子，那样我们就不会出现。时间定在破晓时分。你觉得能赶上吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes," Michael said. "Everything is arranged. There is one thing I should tell you: Stefano Andolini did not keep his appointment with Professor Adonis yesterday. The Professor was very worried."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“能，”迈克尔回答说，“现在是万事俱备。有件事我要告诉你：昨天斯特凡·安多里尼没有如期和阿多尼斯教授见面。教授很担心。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Pisciotta was startled for the first time. Then he shrugged. "The little man was always bad luck," he said. "Now we must say goodbye until tomorrow at dawn." He took Michael's hand in his own.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮肖塔第一次感到惊讶。接着他耸耸肩说：“那个小矮子是个丧门星。现在我们暂时告别，明天拂晓再见。”他抓住迈克的手握了握。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Michael said impulsively, "Come with us to America."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔有些冲动地说：“跟我们一起到美国去吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Michael was strangely moved by these words. Even with his scant knowledge of Pisciotta, he sensed that this was a man who could never be transplanted from the earth and mountains of Sicily. He was too fierce, too bloodthirsty; his coloring, his voice were all of Sicily. He could never trust a strange land.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说来也怪，迈克尔竟被这番话感动了。即使他对皮肖塔不大了解，但他意识到要想让这个人离开西西里的土地和大山是不可能的。这个人太凶狠残忍，太嗜血成性。无论他的肤色，还是他的声音，都是彻头彻尾的西西里人。他永远不可能相信一个陌生的国度。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'll pass you through the gate," Michael said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我送你出大门吧。”迈克尔说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Pisciotta shook his head. "I have lived in Sicily all of my life and I have loved my life. And so I must die in Sicily if I must. But thank you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮肖塔摇了摇头说：“我一直生活在西西里，我喜欢自己的生活。所以即便是死，我也要死在西西里。不过我还是要谢谢你。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No," Pisciotta said. "Our little meeting must remain a secret."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不用了，”皮肖塔说，“我们这个短暂的见面必须保密。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After Pisciotta had left, Michael lay on his bed until dawn, unable to sleep. He would finally meet Turi Guiliano face to face; they would travel to America together. He wondered what kind of man he would find Guiliano to be. Would he be his legend? So much larger than life that he dominated this island and affected the course of a nation? He got up from the bed and opened the shutters. Dawn was finally breaking and he watched the sun move up in the sky and throw a golden highway across the sea, and riding on that broad beam of light he saw the motor launch speeding toward the dock. He rushed out of the villa and down to the beach to greet Peter Clemenza.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮肖塔走后，迈克尔在床上辗转反侧，直到拂晓也无法入眠。他终于要和图里·吉里安诺见面了，他们要一起去美国。他心下思忖，不知这个吉里安诺是什么样的人。他是传说中的那样吗？真的那么了不起？控制着这个岛、影响了一个国家？他从床上爬起来，拉开百叶窗。终于破晓了。他看见太阳正冉冉升起，在海面上铺起一条金光大道，一艘摩托艇正沿着这道金光朝码头疾驶而来。他迅速跑出别墅，冲向海滩，去迎接彼得·克莱门扎。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他们共进早餐时，迈克尔把皮肖塔的造访告诉了他。对皮肖塔能自由出入戒备森严的别墅，克莱门扎好像并不感到惊讶。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They spent the rest of the morning making their plans for the meeting with Guiliano. There might be spies watching the villa for any extraordinary movement; a column of automobiles would surely attract attention. Also Michael would certainly be under close observation. True, the Sicilian Security Police under Inspector Velardi would not interfere, but who knew what treacheries might be afoot?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="整个早上他们都在制订与吉里安诺见面的计划。也许有密探正监视着别墅中不同寻常的活动，一个车队肯定会引起他们的注意。迈克尔无疑也处于他们的密切监视之下。确实，韦拉尔迪的西西里警察是不会来干涉的，但谁知道又会有什么背信弃义的行动呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Michael closed the shutters in his bedroom and lay on the bed. His body was rigid; he could not sleep. Within the next twenty-four hours many terrible things could happen. He had a sense of foreboding. But then he weaved a dream of returning to his home on Long Island, his mother and father waiting for him at the door, his long exile at an end.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔拉上卧室的百叶窗，而后在床上躺下。他的身体僵硬，根本睡不着。在此后二十四小时中，可能会发生很多可怕的事。他有一种不好的预感。接着他做了一个梦：他回到了长岛的家中，他的母亲和父亲在门口等着他，他的长期流亡生活结束了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When they had finished their planning, they had lunch, and then Michael went to his room for an afternoon sleep. He wanted to be fresh for the long night.
