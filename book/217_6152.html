<div class="line_en">"We can get along WITH it, too," he says; "just you slide down cellar and fetch it. And then mosey right down the lightning-rod and come along.

<div class="line_cn" title="“有，我们也能对付嘛，”他说，“你就溜到下边地窖里去一趟，弄一些来，随后抱着避雷针下楼，赶上来。我就去，去把稻草塞进杰姆的衣服里，假扮成他妈的模样。等你一到，我就学羊叫，呣的一声，然后一块儿逃跑。”">查看中文翻译</div>

The hunk of butter, big as a person's fist, was where I had left it, so I took up the slab of corn-pone with it on, and blowed out my light, and started up stairs very stealthy, and got up to the main floor all right, but here comes Aunt Sally with a candle, and I clapped the truck in my hat, and clapped my hat on my head, and the next second she see me; and she says:</div>

<div class="line_en">I did wish Aunt Sally would come, and get done with me, and lick me, if she wanted to, and let me get away and tell Tom how we'd overdone this thing, and what a thundering hornet's-nest we'd got ourselves into, so we could stop fooling around straight off, and clear out with Jim before these rips got out of patience and come for us.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我确实巴不得萨莉阿姨快来，跟我说个清楚，高兴的话，就揍我一顿，随后放开我，让我好告诉汤姆，我们怎样把事情搞得太过火了，怎样已经一头撞上了一个天大的马蜂窝了，怎样该在这些家伙失去耐性找到我们头上来以前，就和杰姆溜之大吉，一逃了事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So she went away as I opened the door and walked into the setting-room. My, but there was a crowd there! Fifteen farmers, and every one of them had a gun. I was most powerful sick, and slunk to a chair and set down. They was setting around, some of them talking a little, in a low voice, and all of them fidgety and uneasy, but trying to look like they warn't; but I knowed they was, because they was always taking off their hats, and putting them on, and scratching their heads, and changing their seats, and fumbling with their buttons. I warn't easy myself, but I didn't take my hat off, all the same.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是她走开了，我把门打开，走进了起坐间。我的天，这么一大群人！有十五个农民，一个个带了枪。我怕得要死，便轻手轻脚走了过去，在一张椅子里坐下。这些人围坐在一起，其中有些人偶然谈几句话，声音放得轻轻的。一个个心神不定，坐立不安，可又装得若无其事。不过我知道他们真正的心理，因为你可以看到，他们一会把帽子摘下来，一会又戴上，一会儿抓抓脑瓜，一会儿换个座位，一会儿摸摸钮扣，如此等等。我自己呢，也心神不定，只是我自始至终，并没有把帽子摘下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At last she come and begun to ask me questions, but I COULDN'T answer them straight, I didn't know which end of me was up; because these men was in such a fidget now that some was wanting to start right NOW and lay for them desperadoes, and saying it warn't but a few minutes to midnight; and others was trying to get them to hold on and wait for the sheep-signal; and here was Aunty pegging away at the questions, and me a-shaking all over and ready to sink down in my tracks I was that scared; and the place getting hotter and hotter, and the butter beginning to melt and run down my neck and behind my ears; and pretty soon, when one of them says, "I'M for going and getting in the cabin FIRST and right NOW, and catching them when they come," I most dropped; and a streak of butter come a-trickling down my forehead, and Aunt Sally she see it, and turns white as a sheet, and says:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她终于来了，便开始盘问我，不过我无法直接了当地回答。我已经慌得六神无主，不知如何是好。因为这伙人如今已是焦躁不安，其中有些人主张立时立刻马上就动手，去埋伏好，等候那些亡命之徒。还说现在离半夜整只有几分钟了。有些人则力图劝说他们暂时按兵不动，静候羊呣呣叫的信号。姨妈呢，偏偏盯着我问这问那。我呢，浑身发抖，吓得要晕过去了。房间里又闷又热，牛油开始在化，流到了我的颈子里和耳朵根的后边。这时，有一个人在叫：“我主张先到小屋里去，现时立刻就去，他们一来，就逮起来。”我听了差点儿昏过去，同时一道黄油从额骨头上往下流淌，萨莉阿姨一见，马上脸色白得象一张纸。她说：">查看中文翻译</div>
