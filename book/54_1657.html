<div class="line_en">After Uncle Hammer left on New Year's Day, Papa and I had gone into the forest, down the cow path, and to the misty hollow where the trees lay fallen. For a while we stood looking again at the destruction, sitting on one of our fallen friends, we talked in quiet, respectful tones, observing the soft mourning of the forest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈默大伯在新年那天离开后，我和爸爸一块儿走到森林，走到了雾气氤氲的山谷，那里的树大多被砍倒了。看着这一片被破坏了的森林，我和爸爸呆站了好一会儿，然后坐在一棵被砍倒的树干上。林子里透着莫名的哀伤气息。">查看中文翻译</div>

"But the way I see it, the Bible didn't mean for you to be no fool. Now one day, maybe I can forgive John Andersen for what he done to these trees, but I ain't gonna forget it.

If I'd've gone after Charlie Simms and given him a good thrashing like I felt like doing, the hurt to all of us would've been a whole lot more than the hurt you received, so I let it be. I don't like letting it be, but I can live with that decision."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“凯西，在这个世界上，有很多你不愿去做的事情，但为了生存，你不得不选择去做。对于西蒙对你做的事情，我和你大伯一样生气，但我必须权衡一下，我去找他算账后会带来的伤害，会不会比你之前所受的伤害更大。如果那造成的伤害更大，那我便会随它去。虽然我做这种妥协也很不乐意，但只有这样，我们才能生存下去。”">查看中文翻译</div>

He turned toward me so that he looked me full in the face, and the seriousness of his eyes startled me. He held my chin up with the wide flat of his hard hand.

<div class="line_en">For the month of January I was Lillian Jean's slave and she thoroughly enjoyed it. She even took to waiting for me in the morning with Jeremy so that I could carry her books. When friends of hers walked with us, she bragged about her little colored friend and almost hugged herself with pleasure when I called her "Miz" Lillian Jean. When we were alone, she confided her secrets to me: the boy she had passionately loved for the past year and the things she had done to attract his attention (with no success, I might add); the secrets of the girls she couldn't stand as well as those she could; and even a tidbit or two about her elder brothers' romantic adventures. All I had to do to prime the gossip pump was smile nicely and whisper a "Miz Lillian Jean" every now and then. I almost hated to see the source dry up.</div>

I took Lillian Jean's books, and as we sauntered down the road, I only half listened to her; I was sweeping the road, looking for the deep wooded trail I had selected earlier in the week.

As we emerged from the forest into the Avery yard, the house appeared deserted, but then we spied T. J., lazily swinging straddle- legged atop an inner tube hanging from an old oak in the front yard. Stacey immediately charged toward him, and when T. J. saw him coming he tried to swing his long right leg over the tube to escape. He didn't make it. Stacey jumped up on the inner tube, giving them both a jerky ride before they landed hard on Mr. Avery's azalea bush.</div>
