<div class="line_en">We were in their drawing room. It was the same room I had been interviewed in, except this time Mrs Traynor and her daughter were perched on the sofa, their slobbery old dog between them. Mr Traynor was standing by the fire. I was wearing my French peasant's jacket in indigo denim, a minidress and a pair of army boots. With hindsight, I realized, I could have picked a more professional-looking uniform in which to outline my plan.</div>

Her daughter, curled up next to her on the sofa, just glowered -- the kind of face Mum used to warn me would stick in place if the wind changed. It wasn't quite the enthusiastic response I'd been hoping for.</div>

I didn't add that the mere thought of driving to the hospital in sole charge of Will was still enough to bring me out in a cold sweat.

Nearly twenty years on, nothing had really changed. We had to babysit Thomas so that Treena could still go out, feed him so that Treena didn't have to worry, buy her extra-nice presents at birthdays and Christmas "because Thomas means she often goes without". Well, she could go without my bloody lemons washbag. I stuck a note on my door which read: "My stuff is MINE. GO AWAY."

People read magazines and chatted quietly. The section where old men used to fall asleep over the free newspapers had disappeared, replaced by a large oval table with computers dotted around the perimeter. I sat down gingerly at one of these, hoping that nobody was watching. Computers, like books, are my sister's thing. Luckily, they seemed to have anticipated the sheer terror felt by people like me. A librarian stopped by my table, and handed me a card and a laminated sheet with instructions on it. She didn't stand over my shoulder, just murmured that she would be at the desk if I needed any further help, and then it was just me and a chair with a wonky castor and the blank screen.</div>

If there is other stuff he does on there, I don't really want to know about it. But I followed the librarian's instructions, double-checking every stage as I completed it. And, astonishingly, it worked. It didn't just work, but it was easy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这么多年来我只接触过帕特里克的电脑。他只用电脑下载健身计划，或者从亚马逊网站订购体育运动技术书籍。要是他还用电脑做了别的事情，我确实也不太想知道。我遵循着图书管理员的指示，仔细地查看每个页面。令人吃惊的是，一切进展顺利。何止是顺利，简直太简单了！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And nobody mentioned the Judy Blume. Mind you, that was probably because I had used my sister's library card.</div>

<div class="line_en">In my little room at home, I opened it out, pinned it carefully to the back of my door and marked the date when I had started at the Traynors', way back at the beginning of February. Then I counted forward, and marked the date -- 12 August -- now barely four months ahead. I took a step back and stared at it for a while, trying to make the little black ring bear some of the weight of what it heralded. And as I stared, I began to realize what I was taking on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="回到家，在我的小房间里，我打开日历，小心地把日历钉在门后，标出了我在特雷纳家上班的第一天，也就是二月初。然后我往后数，标出了那一天——8月12日——现在只剩下四个月了。我退后一步，盯着日历看了一会儿，想让那只小黑圈承担一些它所预示的重量。盯着它看时，我才意识到我所肩负的责任。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I would have to fill those little white rectangles with a lifetime of things that could generate happiness, contentment, satisfaction or pleasure. I would have to fill them with every good experience I could summon up for a man whose powerless arms and legs meant he could no longer make them happen by himself. I had just under four months' worth of printed rectangles to pack out with days out, trips away, visitors, lunches and concerts. I had to come up with all the practical ways to make them happen, and do enough research to make sure that they didn't fail.</div>
