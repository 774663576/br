<div class="line_en">We had to go into Norderney town to buy food and milk, and to collect my post. I was surprised to find that there were two letters for me from my boss.

I showed them to Davies.</div>

<div class="line_en">As we made our way back to the harbour, a thick curtain of fog rolled in from the sea. "We'll never find the yacht in this fog," I said, as we climbed down to the dinghy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们动身回海港时，浓浓的雾气从海上升起，向港口逼近。“雾这么大，咱们肯定找不到船。”我们爬进小艇时，我说道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, we will," said Davies. "Just row straight across the harbour." He leaned over the side of the boat, feeling in the water with a stick. "There we are," he said, after a few moments. "That's the edge of the deep water channel. Now all we've got to do is follow it until we reach the Dulcibella. It couldn't be simpler." And, sure enough, in two or three minutes we were back on the yacht.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，咱们能找到。”戴维斯说，“就往港口的正对岸划吧。”他把身子探出船舷，用一根棍子在水中摸索。“就是这儿。”过了一会儿，他说，“咱们在深水航道的边上。咱们只要一路顺着航道回‘达尔茜贝拉’号就行，这再简单不过了。”不出两三分钟，我们果真回到了游艇上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“那为什么不去梅默尔特岛呢？”我低声问。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“太厉害了。”我说，“你用这种方法能走多远？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes," I said eagerly. "But what a chance! Everyone's seen the Dulcibella here, including Dollmann and his friends. If we could get to Memmert in this fog, we might find out what's going on. And no one would see us on the way, or know we were there."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是有点远。”我热切地说，“可这是多好的机会呀！所有人都看到‘达尔茜贝拉’号停在这里，包括多尔曼和他的朋友们。我们要是能趁着大雾到梅默尔特岛去，说不定能找出事情的真相，而且不会有人在路上看见我们，也不会有人知道我们去过那儿。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I had got the boat ready by the time he joined me. "We'll have to hurry," he said. "We can't take the open sea route, round Juist. It's too public -- that's the way the ferry goes. And it's more than twenty-five kilometres. No, we'll have to go over the sand. It's a much shorter way, but it'll be difficult because the tide's falling, so the channels through the sandbanks will be extremely narrow and shallow. Are you sure you can row there and back?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他过来时，我已经把小艇准备好了。“咱们得抓紧。”他说，“不能走于斯特附近的公海航线，太惹眼了——渡船就走那条线，而且全程有25公里多。不行，咱们得从沙洲过去。这样路程短得多，但是会很难走，因为现在是落潮，沙洲间的航道会特别窄、特别浅。你确定你能划到那儿再划回来吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Davies took down the chart and studied it. "Put some food and water in the dinghy," he said. "And an oil lamp, the compass and the guns."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="戴维斯取下海图研究起来。“在小艇里放些食物和水。”他说，“还有一盏油灯，再带上指南针和枪。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The guns?" I said. "What for?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“枪？”我问，“干什么用？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We're looking for ducks, if the fog clears," he smiled. "Now, just give me ten minutes with the chart."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“要是雾散了，我们就假装在找野鸭。”他笑道，“现在让我看看海图，10分钟就好。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Even at high tide, the chart only shows narrow channels between Norderney and Memmert, and in a little over three hours" time, it would be low tide. The fog made the sandbanks completely invisible, but Davies did not attempt to look around for buoys or marker posts. Instead, he concentrated all his attention on the chart, the compass, and his watch. My duty was to be a machine, to keep the dinghy moving in whatever direction he wanted. I pulled hard, breathing deeply and regularly, hoping I would be fit enough to manage the journey.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="即使在涨潮的时候，海图显示诺德奈和梅默尔特岛之间也只有狭窄的航道，更何况再过三个小时多一点就是落潮了。浓雾中完全看不见沙洲，可戴维斯并没有试图寻找浮标或者标志杆，而是把全部注意力集中在海图、指南针和手表上。我则像一台机器，负责把小艇划向戴维斯指示的任何方向。我使劲儿划着桨，保持着均匀的深呼吸，希望自己的身体足够强壮，能胜任这次航行。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You steer, and I'll row all right," I said. And we set out.</div>

<div class="line_en">At the shallowest point, Davies dropped the lead line into the water, and measured the depth. My oar touched sand, and we were aground. I rested for a moment, while Davies looked at his chart. Then we were off again, with a push from the oars on the sandbank, and I could see from Davies's shining eyes that we were in the right channel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到了最浅的地方，戴维斯把水砣绳抛进水中测量深度。我的桨触到了沙子，船搁浅了。我休息了一会儿，戴维斯则查看着海图。接着，我用船桨推了一下沙洲，我们又开始了航程，从戴维斯闪闪发亮的眼神里，我知道我们走对航道了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We continued in this way, rowing and pushing, through the soundless white blanket of fog. I began to lose all idea of time and place. The misty figure of Davies in front of me seemed as dream-like and crazy as myself, and I saw strange, imaginary shapes appearing out of nowhere.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们继续这样前行，在寂静的茫茫白雾中划桨、推桨，划桨、推桨。我对时间和地点的概念渐渐变得模糊。前面戴维斯模糊的身影看上去跟我自己一样疯狂、一样不真实，我眼前甚至莫名其妙地出现了各种奇怪的幻影。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was a race against time, the fog, and the falling tide, but in the early afternoon we arrived at Memmert. In four and a half hours I had rowed twenty kilometres, and Davies had steered us through fog and sandbanks without a single mistake. I let my tired muscles relax, and we had some whisky, bread and cold meat, while making our plans. We decided Davies would stay with the boat, while I explored. I spoke the language well, and in my sea-boots, sailing clothes, and old hat, I could easily pass for a Frisian Islander in the fog.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们和时间、浓雾还有即将到来的落潮赛跑，总算在午后不久到达梅默尔特岛。四个半小时内我划了20公里，戴维斯则准确无误地指引我们的船穿过了浓雾和沙洲。我让疲惫的肌肉放松一下，我们一边做计划，一边就着威士忌吃了些面包和冷餐肉。商量的结果是戴维斯留在船上，我去考察一番，因为我德语讲得好，而且穿着航海靴、航海服，戴着旧帽子，在大雾中很容易被人当成弗里西亚群岛的岛民。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Take the compass, the chart, and the whistle," said Davies. "Remember the tide -- you can have an hour and a half, no more. If you can't find your way back, blow your whistle, and I'll blow mine to guide you. Good luck."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“带上指南针、海图和哨子。”戴维斯说，“记着涨潮的时间——你只有一个半小时的时间。要是找不到回来的路就吹哨子，我会吹响我的哨子来给你指路。祝你好运。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The chart showed that the office building was north-west of where we had landed. "That means south-east to come back," I said to myself. I checked the compass, and started up the beach.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="海图显示那栋办公楼在我们靠岸处的西北方向。“也就是说回来要往东南方向走。”我对自己说。我看了看指南针，沿着岸边向北走去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I could hear a number of men's voices, so I moved away from the sound, round the corner of the building, and saw a lighted window ahead of me. It would be interesting to see into that room, I thought, so with my hat pulled well down, I walked slowly on, taking a long careful look inside as I passed. It seemed to be an office. I could see Grimm paying a workman some money, and in chairs round the room I could see von Brüning and Dollmann, and the short, older man from the ferry (who was, we learnt later, the Bremen engineer, Böhme). The room was brightly lit and no one was looking out through the window, so I went back for a closer inspection. Bending low, I moved, as quietly as a cat, until I was beneath the window. Then, with great care, I raised my head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我听到有几个男人的声音，便走远一些，绕过大楼一角，看到面前一扇亮灯的窗户。我想往屋里看看一定很有意思，便把帽子压得很低，缓缓走过那扇窗户，经过时仔细朝里面看了好几眼。屋子看来是一间办公室。我看到格林正在付钱给一个工人，屋里的椅子上坐着冯布吕宁、多尔曼，还有渡船上那个矮个子的年长男子（后来我们得知他就是那个来自不来梅的工程师博默）。房间里灯火通明，没有人往窗外看，所以我又折回去想观察得更仔细些。我弯下身子，像猫一样悄无声息地移到窗子下面，接着小心翼翼地抬起头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I could only see a few metres ahead of me in the fog, but I could hear noises all around me -- a ship's bell, and some men calling to each other in German. Somewhere in front a door banged. Before long, I found myself on a path, and a few moments later a wall appeared, which seemed to be the side of a building. I paused, and took out my pipe and lit it, to give myself an excuse for standing still and listening.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在雾中，我只能看清前方几米的东西，却能听到周围各种声音——一艘轮船的钟声，还有一些人用德语喊话的声音。前面某个地方，有一扇门砰地关上了。没过多久，我发现自己走上了一条小径，再过一会儿出现了一堵墙，似乎是一栋大楼的侧面。我停下来，掏出烟斗点燃，这样就有理由站在那里仔细听一听。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a different workman in the room now, also receiving his wages from Grimm. There were charts on the wall, and the plan of a ship. On the floor were several pieces of old wood, perhaps from the wreck itself. My heart sank. This was pay-day, with the boat crews and divers getting their wages -- just an ordinary meeting of the directors of the company. Davies and I had come all this way for nothing!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在房间里换了一个工人，也在从格林那里领工钱。墙上挂着几张海图，还有一艘轮船的平面图，地板上有几块旧木头，可能是那艘沉船上的。我的心一沉。这是发薪水的日子，船员和潜水员都来领工资——这只是公司董事们的一次平常会议罢了。戴维斯和我大老远跑来，却什么也打探不到！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Two more men came in to get their wages, and left. Then Grimm stood up and came over to the window. I quickly bent down low, and heard above me the curtains being pulled shut. There was the sound of chairs moving, and people sitting down. Another meeting seemed to be beginning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="又有两个人进来领工钱，然后离开。接着，格林站起身来走到窗边，我赶紧低下身子，听到在我上方窗帘被拉上了。接着是椅子移动的声音，屋里的人坐了下来，似乎要开始另一个会议。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Desperate to hear what they were saying, I put my ear as close to the window as possible, but I could only hear a few words now and then. First Dollmann spoke for several minutes. He seemed to be talking about a recent visit to England, and I heard the word "Chatham". Next, Böhme went through a report. He used the letters A to G; seven letters, with figures added to each of them, like this: "A… bad… one point five; B… three weeks… thirty; C… thirty-two… one point two." And so on. Then he asked Grimm about each of these seven letters. I could only hear odd words of Grimm's answers: "tugs", "railway", "pilots", "depth of water", and the name "Esens".</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我急切地想听到他们在说什么，便把耳朵尽可能贴近窗户，却只能断断续续地听到几个词。多尔曼先讲了几分钟，好像是说最近去了趟英国，我听到了“查塔姆”这个地名。接下来是博默作汇报，他用了“A”到“G”七个字母，每个字母后面都列了数字，比如：“A……不怎么样……1.5；B……三个星期……30；C……32……1.2。”等等。接着他就这七个字母一一询问了格林，我只能听到格林的零星回答：“拖船”、“铁路”、“引航员”、“水深”，还有地名“埃森斯”。">查看中文翻译</div>

When I reached the shore, the tide was coming in fast but there was no sign of Davies or the dinghy. I had no time to go looking for them, so I blew my whistle.

Soon after we left, a wind began to blow from the west, and the fog rolled away as quickly as it had come. We were almost at Norderney when we saw behind us the lights of a motorboat. Davies guessed it was the Blitz 's launch, and we watched it draw level and pass us, going in the direction of Norderney.</div>

<div class="line_en">When we arrived, the launch was anchored beside the Dulcibella, but we could only see two of von Brüning's men on deck. Then we saw von Brüning himself appear from the Dulcibella 's cabin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们到达时，摩托艇已经停泊在“达尔茜贝拉”号旁边，但甲板上只有冯布吕宁的两个手下。接着，我们看到冯布吕宁自己从“达尔茜贝拉”号的船舱里钻了出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Is that you, Herr Davies?" he said. "We came to see you!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是你吗，戴维斯先生？”他说，“我们来看你了！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then someone else came up the ladder from the cabin, and Dollmann appeared. Davies sat quietly in the dinghy, looking up at his enemy, while Dollmann stared down at him from the deck of the Dulcibella. It was fortunate that Davies's expression was hidden in the darkness, but the lights from the launch fell pitilessly on Dollmann's smiling face, and showed me the thin lips and cold eyes of the man who had tried to drown my friend.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，又有人从船舱的梯子上来，多尔曼出现了。戴维斯静静地坐在小艇中，抬头望着他的敌人，多尔曼也从“达尔茜贝拉”号的甲板上俯视着他。幸运的是戴维斯的表情被黑暗掩盖了，可多尔曼带笑的脸却在摩托艇灯光的映照下暴露无遗。这个曾经试图让我朋友溺水而亡的人，有着薄薄的嘴唇和冷酷的眼神。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Meanwhile, the third of our uninvited guests, Herr Böhme, had reached the top of the ladder. There they stood, the three of them, like guilty schoolboys caught stealing apples, while we, the true offenders, only had to listen to their explanations. Dollmann explained he had seen the yacht in the harbour, and had called on his return from Memmert to ask us to dinner at his house. Finding no one on board, he had meant to leave a note for Davies in the cabin. "My friend, Herr Böhme, was eager to see round the yacht, and I knew you would not mind," he added.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="与此同时，第三位不速之客——博默先生也到了梯子顶端。他们三个人站在那里，就像偷苹果被抓的犯错学童，而我们——真正的冒犯者，却只需听他们解释。多尔曼说他之前在港口看见我们的游艇，从梅默尔特岛回来后便来拜访我们，请我们去他家赴宴。看到船上没人，他打算在船舱里给戴维斯留个字条。“我的朋友博默先生很想看看这艘游艇，我知道你们不会介意的。”他补充道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你们去哪儿了？”冯布吕宁微笑着问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Not at all," said Davies pleasantly. "And we'll come to dinner with pleasure. But we must change clothes first."</div>

<div class="line_en">And with some embarrassment, the three men stepped on to the launch, which moved smoothly away. We went straight down to the cabin to see what they had been looking at. Everything was just as we had left it, except Dollmann's book, which was pushed right to the back of the shelf.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="三人有些尴尬地踏上摩托艇，平稳地开走了。我们赶紧下到船舱里，看看他们都看了什么。一切都保持着我们走时的样子，只有多尔曼的书被推到了架子最里面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Aha!" I said, showing it to Davies. "I think this proves Dollmann has something to hide from them."</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's quite complicated, wondering who knows what," I said. "Dollmann can't be sure what we know, and must be terrified of the others finding out that we know who he is -- if we do. It's becoming clear, though, that they don't trust him."</div>
