<div class="line_en">Seven hundred feet up, Jon Snow stood looking down upon the haunted forest. A north wind swirled through the trees below, sending thin white plumes of snow crystals flying from the highest branches, like icy banners. Elsewise nothing moved. Not a sign of life. That was not entirely reassuring. It was not the living that he feared. Even so…</div>

<div class="line_en">Glass, Jon mused, might be of use here. Castle Black needs its own glass gardens, like the ones at Winterfell. We could grow vegetables even in the deep of winter. The best glass came from Myr, but a good clear pane was worth its weight in spice, and green and yellow glass would not work as well. What we need is gold. With enough coin, we could buy 'prentice glass-blowers and glaziers in Myr, bring them north, offer them their freedom for teaching their art to some of our recruits. That would be the way to go about it. If we had the gold. Which we do not.</div>

The woods were empty as far as he could see, but that was not very far.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在冰墙之后，树木高而静地挺立，如被厚厚的白披风所包裹。游骑兵和新兵形成队形后，白灵阔步到琼恩的马旁，停下嗅了嗅，他的呼吸在空气里结霜。“什么？”琼恩问，“那有人吗？”可他所目及的树林里空无一物，即便目及的距离并不远。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The soldier pines and sentinels wore thick white coats, and icicles draped the bare brown limbs of the broadleafs. Jon sent Tom Barleycorn ahead to scout for them, though the way to the white grove was oft trod and familiar. Big Liddle and Luke of Longtown slipped into the brush to east and west. They would flank the column to give warning of any approach. All were seasoned rangers, armed with obsidian as well as steel, warhorns slung across their saddles should they need to summon help.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ghost bounded toward the trees, slipped between two white-cloaked pines, and vanished in a cloud of snow. He wants to hunt, but what? Jon did not fear for the direwolf so much as for any wildlings he might encounter. A white wolf in a white wood, silent as a shadow. They will never know he's coming. He knew better than to go chasing him. Ghost would return when he wanted to and not before. Jon put his heels into his horse. His men fell in around them, the hooves of their garrons breaking through the icy crust to the softer snow beneath. Into the woods they went, at a steady walking pace, as the Wall dwindled behind them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="白灵快步冲向树木，滑向两株白松之间，消失在雪团之中。它想打猎，但猎什么呢？琼恩并不为它可能遭遇野人而担心。一匹白狼在白树之中，静如影，野人们永远不知道它将到来。他知道不必追赶它，白灵总会在琼恩需要时返回，不早不迟。琼恩轻踢马腹，其他人落在后面，马蹄踩碎软雪下的冰层。他们以平稳的速度向心树行进，长城在他们后面不断缩小。">查看中文翻译</div>

Jon could not speak for what they might have been before they reached the Wall, but he did not doubt that most had pasts as black as their cloaks. Up here, they were the sort of men he wanted at his back. Their hoods were raised against the biting wind, and some had scarves wrapped about their faces, hiding their features. Jon knew them, though. Every name was graven on his heart. They were his men, his brothers.</div>

Horse had been born and raised in Mole's Town, Arron and Emrick came from Fair Isle, Satin from the brothels of Oldtown at the other end of Westeros. All of them were boys. Leathers and Jax were older men, well past forty, sons of the haunted forest, with sons and grandsons of their own. They had been two of the sixty-three wildlings who had followed Jon Snow back to the Wall the day he made his appeal, so far the only two to decide they wanted a black cloak. Iron Emmett said they all were ready, or as ready as they were ever going to be. He and Jon and Bowen Marsh had weighed each man in turn and assigned him to an order: Leathers, Jax, and Emrick to the rangers, Horse to the builders, Arron and Satin to the stewards.

<div class="line_cn" title="Iron Emmett骑在队伍的前端，骑在一匹琼恩所见的最为丑陋的马上。那是一个看上去只有毛和蹄子的毛茸野兽。“有传言说昨晚Harlot’s Tower（注：妓女塔）有些麻烦，”士官长说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Hardin's Tower." Of the sixty-three who had come back with him from Mole's Town, nineteen had been women and girls. Jon had housed them in the same abandoned tower where he had once slept when he had been new to the Wall. Twelve were spearwives, more than capable of defending both themselves and the younger girls from the unwanted attentions of black brothers. It was some of the men they'd turned away who'd given Hardin's Tower its new, inflammatory name. Jon was not about to condone the mockery. "Three drunken fools mistook Hardin's for a brothel, that's all. They are in the ice cells now, contemplating their mistake."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是Hardin’s Tower。”琼恩说。六十三个和他从鼹鼠村返回的人里，十九个是女人和女孩。琼恩把她们安置在琼恩曾居住过的废弃塔楼里。十二个矛妇，她们有足够的能力为自己和其他年轻女孩提供防御以防止黑衣兄弟骚扰。正是这些她们不愿面对的男人给了Hardin’s Tower这个新的令人恼火的名字。琼恩不打算原谅这些玩笑。“三个愚蠢的醉汉把Hardin’s当成妓院。他们现在被关进了冰牢里，检讨他们自己的错误。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Iron Emmett grimaced. "Men are men, vows are words, and words are wind. You should put guards around the women."</div>

<div class="line_en">"And who will guard the guards?" You know nothing, Jon Snow. He had learned, though, and Ygritte had been his teacher. If he could not hold to his own vows, how could he expect more of his brothers? But there were dangers in trifling with wildling women. A man can own a woman, and a man can own a knife, Ygritte had told him once, but no man can own both. Bowen Marsh had not been all wrong. Hardin's Tower was tinder waiting for a spark. "I mean to open three more castles," Jon said. "Deep Lake, Sable Hall, and the Long Barrow. All garrisoned with free folk, under the command of our own officers. The Long Barrow will be all women, aside from the commander and chief steward." There would be some mingling, he did not doubt, but the distances were great enough to make that difficult, at least.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“而谁又看着这些守卫呢？”你什么都不懂，琼恩雪诺。他已经吸取过这个教训，耶哥瑞特是他的老师。如果他不能守住自己的誓言，他怎么能指望其他兄弟？但是把这些女野人视同儿戏亦充满危险。男人可以拥有女人，也可以拥有一把刀，耶哥瑞特曾告诉他，但是没有人能同时拥有两者。波文马尔锡并没有全错。Hardin’s Tower是个一触即发的炸药。“我打算再启用三个城堡。”琼恩说。“深湖居，黑貂厅和长车楼。他们都由自由民驻守，由我们的人管理。届时，长车楼将全是女人，总司令和总务长也会对她们束手无策。”他坚信会有男女混住发生，不过至少如此远的距离使这种事很难发生。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Trouble is the lord commander's lot, Jon might have said. His visit to Mole's Town was giving him plenty, as it happened, and the women were the least of it. Halleck was proving to be just as truculent as he had feared, and there were some amongst the black brothers whose hatred of the free folk was bone deep. One of Halleck's followers had already cut off a build-er's ear in the yard, and like as not that was just a taste of the bloodshed to come. He had to get the old forts open soon, so Harma's brother could be sent off to garrison Deep Lake or Sable Hall. Just now, though, neither of those was fit for human habitation, and Othell Yarwyck and his builders were still off trying to restore the Nightfort. There were nights when Jon Snow wondered if he had not made a grievous mistake by preventing Stannis from marching all the wildlings off to be slaughtered. I know nothing, Ygritte, he thought, and perhaps I never will.</div>

<div class="line_en">So he did… on hands and knees, crawling. A big boy, this one. Fourteen feet, at least. Even bigger than Mag the Mighty. Mag had died beneath this very ice, locked in mortal struggle with Donal Noye. A good man. The Watch has lost too many good men. Jon took Leathers aside. "Take charge of him. You speak his tongue.

<div class="line_en">The moment Jon set the letter aside, the parchment curled up again, as if eager to protect its secrets. He was not at all sure how he felt about what he had just read. Battles had been fought at Winterfell before, but never one without a Stark on one side or the other. "The castle is a shell," he said, "not Winterfell, but the ghost of Winterfell." It was painful just to think of it, much less say the words aloud. And still…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那一刻琼恩把信放到一边，羊皮纸又自动卷起，好像它渴望于保守自己的秘密一样。他不知道他读这封信时到底什么感觉。无数战斗曾经在临冬城打响过，但是战斗总有一方会是史塔克家。“城堡只是一个空壳，”他喃喃道，“不再是临冬城了，只不过是临冬城的魂魄而已。”想到这令他悲痛，而且…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He wondered how many men old Crowfood would bring to the fray, and how many swords Arnolf Karstark would be able to conjure up. Half the Umbers would be across the field with Whoresbane, fighting beneath the flayed man of the Dreadfort, and the greater part of the strength of both houses had gone south with Robb, never to return. Even ruined, Winterfell itself would confer a considerable advantage on whoever held it. Robert Baratheon would have seen that at once and moved swiftly to secure the castle, with the forced marches and midnight rides for which he had been famous. Would his brother be as bold?</div>

<div class="line_en">Not likely. Stannis was a deliberate commander, and his host was a half-digested stew of clansmen, southron knights, king's men and queen's men, salted with a few northern lords.

<div class="line_en">He glanced at the letter again. I will save your sister if I can. A surprisingly tender sentiment from Stannis, though undercut by that final, brutal if I can and the addendum and find a better match for her than Ramsay Snow. But what if Arya was not there to be saved? What if Lady Melisandre's flames had told it true? Could his sister truly have escaped such captors? How would she do that?

He might have done better to strike down Mance the moment he revealed himself. Jon had a certain grudging admiration for the late King-Beyond-the-Wall, but the man was an oathbreaker and a turncloak.
