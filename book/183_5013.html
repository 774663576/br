<div class="line_en">They altered course and made for this land, mostly by oar, for the wind would not serve them to sail north-east. When evening fell they were still a long way from it and rowed all night. Next morning the weather was fair but a flat calm. The dark mass lay ahead, much nearer and larger, but still very dim, so that some thought it was still a long way off and others thought they were running into a mist.</div>

<div class="line_en">After this adventure they sailed on south and a little east for twelve days with a gentle wind, the skies being mostly clear and the air warm, and saw no bird or fish, except that once there were whales spouting a long way to starboard. Lucy and Reepicheep played a good deal of chess at this time. Then on the thirteenth day, Edmund, from the fighting top, sighted what looked like a great dark mountain rising out of the sea on their port bow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这番奇遇结束之后，他们顺着和风，向南和略为偏东的方向航行了十二天，天空基本晴朗，空气温暖，看不见鸟，也看不见鱼，只在右舷外远处出现过一次鲸鱼在喷水。这段时间露茜和雷佩契普下了不少回棋。到了第十三天，爱德蒙在桅顶观测台上看到左舷船头海面上矗立黑乎乎的一团，看上去像座大山。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">About nine that morning, very suddenly, it was so close that they could see that it was not land at all, nor even, in an ordinary sense, a mist. It was a Darkness. It is rather hard to describe, but you will see what it was like if you imagine yourself looking into the mouth of a railway tunnel -- a tunnel either so long or so twisty that you cannot see the light at the far end. And you know what it would be like. For a few feet you would see the rails and sleepers and gravel in broad daylight; then there would come a place where they were in twilight; and then, pretty suddenly, but of course without a sharp dividing line, they would vanish altogether into smooth, solid blackness. It was just so here. For a few feet in front of their bows they could see the swell of the bright greenish-blue water. Beyond that, they could see the water looking pale and grey as it would look late in the evening. But beyond that again, utter blackness as if they had come to the edge of moonless and starless night.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天早晨九点光景，突然一下子，他们隔得很近才看出这根本不是陆地，甚至也不是通常意义上所说的迷雾。原来是一片黑暗。这种情况挺难描写，如果你能设想自己朝一条铁路隧道的入口望进去——一条很长很长或弯弯曲曲，望不到远处尽头光线的隧道——那就会明白是什么样子了。你知道穿过隧道是怎么回事。先是在几英尺外看见大白天下的铁轨、枕木和碎石；然后就来到一个幽暗的地方；再后来，突然一下子，当然也没有一个明显的分界线，一切就都在浑然一体的黑暗中无影无踪。这里的情况正是如此。在船头前几英尺外，他们看得见碧绿的海水滔滔。再往外，只见海水变成灰蒙蒙的，像在傍晚时分看上去那样。可是再往远看，就只见一片乌漆墨黑，仿佛他们快来到无星无月的黑夜里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“用处？”雷佩契普答，“用处吗，船长？如果你所说的用处是指填饱我们的肚子或腰包，我承认一点用处也没有。据我所知，我们扬帆远航并不是去找寻‘有用的’东西，而是寻求荣誉和奇遇。眼看就有一场我闻所未闻的了不起的奇遇，如果我们往回走，那我们的荣誉就要受到不少指责。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So the three lanterns, at the stern, and the prow and the masthead, were all lit, and Drinian ordered two torches amidships. Pale and feeble they looked in the sunshine. Then all the men except some who were left below at the oars were ordered on deck and fully armed and posted in their battle stations with swords drawn. Lucy and two archers were posted on the fighting top with bows bent and arrows on the string. Rynelf was in the bows with his line ready to take soundings. Reepicheep, Edmund, Eustace and Caspian, glittering in mail, were with him. Drinian took the tiller.</div>

<div class="line_en">With a creak and a groan the Dawn Treader started to creep forward as the men began to row. Lucy, up in the fighting top, had a wonderful view of the exact moment at which they entered the darkness. The bows had already disappeared before the sunlight had left the stern. She saw it go. At one minute the gilded stern, the blue sea, and the sky, were all in broad daylight: next minute the sea and sky had vanished, the stern lantern -- which had been hardly noticeable before -- was the only thing to show where the ship ended. In front of the lantern she could see the black shape of Drinian crouching at the tiller. Down below her the two torches made visible two small patches of deck and gleamed on swords and helmets, and forward there was another island of light on the forecastle. Apart from that, the fighting top, lit by the masthead light which was only just above her, seemed to be a little lighted world of its own floating in lonely darkness. And the lights themselves, as always happens with lights when you have to have them at the wrong time of day, looked lurid and unnatural. She also noticed that she was very cold.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随着船员开始划桨，黎明踏浪者号发出吱吱嘎嘎，嗯嗯啊啊的声音，悄悄前进了。就在这船开进那片黑暗中那会儿工夫，露茜在桅顶观测台上看到了那片刻的奇观。阳光还照着船尾，船头已经看不见影儿了。她看着它不见的。这会儿镀金的船尾，碧蓝的大海和天空，还都在光天化日之下，过一会儿海天都消失了，刚才还简直一点也看不出的船尾灯，竟成了船尾的惟一标记。她能看出灯前德里宁弯着腰在掌舵的黑影。她下面，那两支火把在甲板上照出两小块亮处，火光在刀剑和头盔上闪烁；往前看，船首楼上也有一块地方亮着。除此之外，恰好在她脑袋上方点着那盏桅顶灯照亮的观测台，似乎自成一个发亮的小天地，漂浮在沉寂的黑暗中。正如你在白天不该点灯的时间只好点灯一样，灯光看上去总是阴森森，不自然的，这些灯光就是这样。她还注意到自己很冷。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">How long this voyage into the darkness lasted, nobody knew. Except for the creak of the rowlocks and the splash of the oars there was nothing to show that they were moving at all. Edmund, peering from the bows, could see nothing except the reflection of the lantern in the water before him. It looked a greasy sort of reflection, and the ripple made by their advancing prow appeared to be heavy, small, and lifeless. As time went on everyone except the rowers began to shiver with cold.</div>

<div class="line_en">Drinian's hand shook on the tiller and a line of cold sweat ran down his face. The same idea was occurring to everyone on board. "We shall never get out, never get' out," moaned the rowers. "He's steering us wrong. We're going round and round in circles. We shall never get out." The stranger, who had been lying in a huddled heap on the deck, sat up and burst out into a horrible screaming laugh.</div>

<div class="line_en">Lucy leant her head on the edge of the fighting top and whispered, "Aslan, Aslan, if ever you loved us at all, send us help now." The darkness did not grow any less, but she began to feel a little -- a very, very little -- better. "After all, nothing has really happened to us yet," she thought.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="露茜把脑袋靠在观测台边上，悄声说：“阿斯兰啊，阿斯兰，如果你当真爱我们，马上来救救我们吧。”那片黑暗虽然并未减少丝毫，可是她开始感到有一点儿——很小很小的一点儿——好转了。“说到头来，我们还没真正出过什么事呢。”她暗暗想道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Never get out!" he yelled. "That's it. Of course. We shall never get out. What a fool I was to have thought they would let me go as easily as that. No, no, we shall never get out."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“出不去了！”他大声喊道，“一点不错。当然啦。我们永远出不去了。我多蠢啊，竟然以为他们会那样轻易地让我走掉。不，不，我们永远出不去了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Look!" cried Rynelf's voice hoarsely from the bows. There was a tiny speck of light ahead, and while they watched a broad beam of light fell from it upon the ship. It did not alter the surrounding darkness, but the whole ship was lit up as if by searchlight. Caspian blinked, stared round, saw the faces of his companions all with wild, fixed expressions. Everyone was staring in the same direction: behind everyone lay his black, sharply-edged shadow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“瞧！”赖尼夫从船头那儿嘶哑地喊道。前头有一小点光，他们仔细看着，那一点光竟发出一大束光来照在船身上。虽然并没改变周围一片漆黑的环境，可是整条船就像给探照灯照亮似的。凯斯宾眨眨眼，朝四下盯着看，只见伙伴们脸上个个都带着狂热而专注的神情。大家都目不转晴地望着同一方向：每个人的身后都横着轮廓分明的黑影。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Lucy looked along the beam and presently saw something in it. At first it looked like a cross, then it looked like an aeroplane, then it looked like a kite, and at last with a whirring of wings it was right overhead and was an albatross. It circled three times round the mast and then perched for an instant on the crest of the gilded dragon at the prow. It called out in a strong sweet voice what seemed to be words though no one understood them. After that it spread its wings, rose, and began to fly slowly ahead, bearing a little to starboard. Drinian steered after it not doubting that it offered good guidance. But no one except Lucy knew that as it circled the mast it had whispered to her, "Courage, dear heart," and the voice, she felt sure, was Aslan's, and with the voice a delicious smell breathed in her face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="露茜顺着光束看去，不一会儿就看见光束里有什么东西。开头看上去像个十字架，后来看上去像架飞机，再后来看上去像个风筝，最后翅膀呼呼地旋转，就飞到头顶上空，原来是只信天翁。信天翁绕着桅杆飞了三圈，接着在船头金龙的颈脊上歇了片刻。它发出一串有力的悦耳声音，似乎在说什么，可没人听得懂。之后它就张开双翅飞了起来，开头在前面飞得很慢，稍微偏向右舷。德里宁对它的导航深信不疑，就跟着它驾驶。可是除了露茜，谁也不知道它绕着桅杆飞时悄悄对她说过：“放勇敢些，心肝儿。”她相信这是阿斯兰的声音，话音未落，还有一股美妙的香味散发到她脸上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They blinked their eyes and looked about them. The brightness of the ship herself astonished them: they had half expected to find that the darkness would cling to the white and the green and the gold in the form of some grime or scum.
