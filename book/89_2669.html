<div class="line_en">Omar and Dino are the first to throw themselves into the game with Vega. At first they are guarded, as if every movement is made in sorrow, but before long they are playing as if it's just another evening. They play without memory, because they don't know any other way of doing it. More children turn up, first Toad and Ben but soon others too. Britt-Marie doesn't recognize every one of them, but they all have jeans that are ripped over their thighs. They play as if they live in Borg.</div>

<div class="line_en">The very tall man, who really is quite unreasonably tall, points at Dino and explains that they lived in three countries and seven cities before they came to Borg. Sven helpfully translates. Britt-Marie understands English perfectly well, but she lets him go on, fearing that she might otherwise be expected to say something. The tall man's mouth judders up and down in a melancholy way when he says that small children don't remember things, which is a blessing. But Dino was old enough to see and hear and remember. He remembers everything they had to flee from.</div>

He makes a few movements with which he seems to be heading back into the BMW, but then the soccer ball comes rolling up and stops by his feet. Omar is standing a few feet away. Kent puts the sole of his shoe on the ball and looks at the boy. Kicks the ball to him. Omar stops it with the side of his foot, so it bounces back to Kent.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从他的眼神看，他似乎很想走进披萨店，然而他的脚却朝相反的方向走去。他做了几个动作，好像打算回到宝马车上去，但这时候孩子们的足球滚过来，停在他脚边，奥马尔站在几英尺之外。肯特踩着球，看着奥马尔，把球踢还给他，奥马尔用脚的侧面一挡，球反弹到肯特那边。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Thirty seconds later Kent is in the middle of the pile of children, his shirt creased and hanging down outside his belt, his hair untidy. Instantly, he's happy. When the ball comes flying to him at knee-height, he gathers himself and kicks as hard as he can, misses the ball, and watches one of his shoes flying off and clearing the top of the fence along the side of the recreation center.</div>

<div class="line_en">Britt-Marie dabs her cheeks with her handkerchief so no one can see she's wiping her eyes. Then she walks purposefully through the pizzeria to Somebody. There are still people everywhere. Ben's mother and Dino's uncle and Toad's parents, but also a lot of other people whose faces Britt-Marie can only dimly recall from the soccer cup. They are cleaning up and putting the chairs in order, and she only just manages to resist the urge to straighten them again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布里特—玛丽拿出手帕，开始擦脸，这样别人就不会发现她其实是在擦眼睛。接着她穿过披萨店，走向坐轮椅的女人。店里仍然有不少人，比如本的母亲、恐龙的叔叔、蛤蟆的父母，还有些布里特—玛丽想不起名字的熟悉面孔，她只记得他们都去看过杯赛。这些人正在打扫卫生，排列桌椅，布里特—玛丽很想过去再重新整理一遍，不过最后还是忍住了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She stands on her own in the doorway until the children stop playing. They go home, one after the other. At a distance, Sven waits patiently for Vega and Omar. He lets the children take the time they need. Vega goes directly to the backseat and closes the door behind her, but Omar wanders on his own along the plank and runs his fingers across the white jerseys. He leans over the candles on the ground, carefully picks one up that has gone out, and relights it by holding it over the flame of another, then puts it back. When he straightens up he sees Britt-Marie in the doorway. His hand moves almost unnoticeably away from his hip, in a little wave. A wave from a young man is much more than a wave from a child. She waves back as much as she can without showing him that she is crying.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她独自站在门口，一直等到孩子们踢完球，一个接一个地回家去。斯文站在远处耐心地等待薇卡和奥马尔，允许他们慢慢来。薇卡直接钻到车后座，关上了门，但奥马尔在木篱笆那儿溜达了一会儿，手指在那排白色球衣上摸了一遍，然后蹲到地上的蜡烛旁，小心地拿起一根已经熄灭了的，就着其他蜡烛的火焰重新把它点燃，放回原处。当他直起身子的时候，看到了门口的布里特—玛丽，他搁在屁股上的那只手轻轻抬了抬，似乎是朝她挥手，来自年轻人的挥手远比小孩子的挥手意义重大得多，于是她奋力朝他挥手，转移他的注意力，不让他看到自己在哭。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She goes down to the parking area just as the police car pulls into the road and heads off towards the children's house. Kent is waiting for her, sweaty, his shirt creased and hanging loose, his hair on end to one side of his large head -- and he still only has one shoe. He looks quite, quite mad. It reminds her of how he used to look when they were children. Back then it never bothered him that other people would shake their heads at him; he was never afraid of making a fool of himself. He never needed anyone's affirmation except hers.</div>
