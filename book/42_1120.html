<div class="line_en">They hadn't gone very far before Zero had another attack. He clutched his stomach as he let himself fall to the ground. Stanley could only wait for it to pass. The sploosh had saved Zero's life, but it was now destroying him from the inside. He wondered how long it would be before he, too, felt the effects.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没走多远，零蛋又发作了。他倒在地上，双手紧紧按着肚子。在零蛋的阵痛消失前，斯坦利只能等待。斯蒲露救了零蛋的命，可现在却在他体内摧残他。斯坦利不知道再过多久自己也会出现同样的反应。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was the hottest part of the day. Stanley's empty-empty-empty canteen was still strapped around his neck. He thought back to the water truck, and wished he'd at least stopped and filled his canteen before running off.</div>

<div class="line_en">Zero used the shovel as a third leg. Two legs weren't enough to keep him up. "I got to stop and rest," he said after a while.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Just give me a second," Zero said. He took another breath, then, using the shovel, pulled himself back to his feet. He gave Stanley the thumbs-up sign and they continued.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“再给我一点时间。”零蛋说。他又吸了一口气，在铲子的支撑下站了起来。他冲斯坦利竖了竖大拇指。他们继续上路。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="那谁给我挖墓呢？他想道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Zero collapsed. The shovel stayed up a fraction of a second longer, perfectly balanced on the tip of the blade, then it fell next to him.</div>

<div class="line_en">The spelling seemed to help Zero. It gave him something to concentrate on besides his pain and weakness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拼写游戏似乎对零蛋很管用，帮他转移了注意力，暂时忘了自己的疼痛和虚弱的身体。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He wondered which was closer: Camp Green Lake or Big Thumb?</div>

<div class="line_en">It distracted Stanley as well. The next time he looked up at Big Thumb, it really did seem closer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="它同样也让斯坦利分散了注意力。当他再次抬头望大拇指山时，感觉它真的近了一些。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They quit spelling words when it hurt too much to talk. Stanley's throat was dry. He was weak and exhausted, yet as bad as he felt, he knew that Zero felt ten times worse. As long as Zero could keep going, he could keep going, too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们不再拼写单词了，这样说话太费精力。斯坦利的喉咙已经干透了。他又虚弱又疲惫。尽管感觉很糟，但他明白零蛋承受的痛苦比他要糟上十倍。只要零蛋能继续走，他也会继续走下去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was possible, he thought, he hoped, that he didn't get any of the bad bacteria. Zero hadn't been able to unscrew the lid. Maybe the bad germs couldn't get in, either. Maybe the bacteria were only in the jars which opened easily, the ones he was now carrying in his sack.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他心想，他也希望自己没有喝下有害的细菌。零蛋没能打开盖子，没准有害细菌就无法进去。也许细菌只在轻而易举就被打开的罐子里，就像他现在袋里装的那种。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What scared Stanley the most about dying wasn't his actual death. He figured he could handle the pain. It wouldn't be much worse than what he felt now. In fact, maybe at the moment of his death he would be too weak to feel pain. Death would be a relief. What worried him the most was the thought of his parents not knowing what happened to him, not knowing whether he was dead or alive. He hated to imagine what it would be like for his mother and father, day after day, month after month, not knowing, living on false hope. For him, at least, it would be over. For his parents, the pain would never end.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="令斯坦利最害怕的不是自己真的死了。他觉得自己能忍受疼痛，这比他此刻的感觉差不了多少。实际上，到了临死的那一刻，或许他已经虚弱得感觉不到疼痛了。死亡也许是种解脱。最让他担心的是爸爸妈妈还不知道他出了什么事，不清楚他是死是活。他俩日复一日、月复一月地被蒙在鼓里，守着虚幻的希望过日子，那会变成什么样呢？想到这些，斯坦利就感到难受。对他而言，至少一切都结束了，可对他的父母来说，痛苦永远不会结束。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Stanley saw a rut, about a foot wide and six inches deep, running down a cliff. On either side of the rut were a series of ledges. "Let's try there," he said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利看到一道约一英尺宽、六英寸深的车辙从悬崖上蜿蜒而下。车辙两边是一排排岩架。“试试走那里吧。”他说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You okay?" Stanley asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你还好吗？”斯坦利问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Zero stayed with him, somehow. His frail body trembled terribly as he climbed the stone wall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不管怎样，零蛋一直跟在他后面。爬石壁的时候，他那虚弱的身子剧烈地颤抖着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Some of the ledges were wide enough to sit on. Others stuck out no more than a few inches -- just enough for a quick step. Stanley stopped about two-thirds of the way up, on a fairly wide ledge. Zero came up alongside him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有些岩架很宽，可以坐在上面；有的只突出那么几英寸——只够垫脚用。斯坦利爬了大约三分之二的路程时，在一块还算宽敞的岩架上停了下来。零蛋爬到他旁边。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stanley still managed to hold the sack of jars in his left hand as he slowly moved up, from ledge to ledge, crisscrossing the rut. At times he had to use the side of the rut for support, in order to make it to the next ledge.</div>
