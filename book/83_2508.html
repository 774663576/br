<div class="line_en">The trees on the upper side of Laverne Terrace had fresh green leaves after the rain. In the cool afternoon sunlight I could see the steep drop of the hill and the flight of steps down which the killer had run after his three shots in the darkness. Two small houses fronted on the street below. They might or might not have heard the shots.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was no activity in front of Geiger's house or anywhere along the block. The box hedge looked green and peaceful and the shingles on the roof were still damp. I drove past slowly, gnawing at an idea. I hadn't looked in the garage the night before. Once Geiger's body slipped away I hadn't really wanted to find it. It would force my hand. But dragging him to the garage, to his own car and driving that off into one of the hundred odd lonely canyons around Los Angeles would be a good way to dispose of him for days or even for weeks. That supposed two things: a key to his car and two in the party. It would narrow the sector of search quite a lot, especially as I had had his personal keys in my pocket when it happened.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不管是盖革家门前，还是这个街区的其他地方，都没有动静。黄杨树障碧绿、平静，屋顶上的木瓦片还是湿漉漉的。我驱车缓缓驶过，始终在思忖一件事。前一天晚上我没去查看车库。发现盖革尸体不见了的时候，我并没有真的想找到它。当时我还没准备好，去找的话太勉强。不过想让别人几天甚至几个礼拜都找不到盖革，那把他的尸体拖去车库，再拖上他的车运去洛杉矶周边那上百条荒凉偏僻的峡谷中的一条确实是个好主意。这么做要有两个前提：凶手有他的车钥匙和家门、车库的两把钥匙。这么一来，搜索范围就变小了很多，尤其是尸体消失时，他身上那串钥匙已经在我口袋里了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I went on up the street and parked and walked back. In the daylight it seemed an exposed and dangerous thing to do. I went in through the hedge. She stood there straight and silent against the locked front door. One hand went slowly up to her teeth and her teeth bit at her funny thumb. There were purple smears under her eyes and her face was gnawed white by nerves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我又往上开了一段，停好车走回来。光天化日，这么做好像在暴露自己，很危险。我穿进树障。她笔挺地站在那儿，默然靠着上锁的大门。她把一只手慢慢抬到嘴边，啃咬起奇形怪状的大拇指来。她眼睛下面有紫色的污斑，紧张不安折磨得她脸色惨白。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I didn't get a chance to look at the garage. The doors were shut and padlocked and something moved behind the hedge as I drew level. A woman in a green and white check coat and a small button of a hat on soft blond hair stepped out of the maze and stood looking wild-eyed at my car, as if she hadn't heard it come up the hill. Then she turned swiftly and dodged back out of sight. It was Carmen Sternwood, of course.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我没有机会看一眼车库。门关着，还上了锁，当我走到跟树障并排的位置时，树后面竟有什么东西在动。一个女人从曲径里走了出来。她穿一件绿白相间的格子外套，柔软的金发上戴一顶小圆帽子，两眼发直地看着我的车，好像没听到它上山似的。接着她迅速一转身，不知闪到哪里去了。是卡门·斯特恩伍德，当然了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The girl and I stood looking at each other. She tried to keep a cute little smile on her face but her face was too tired to be bothered. It kept going blank on her. The smile would wash off like water off sand and her pale skin had a harsh granular texture under the stunned and stupid blankness of her eyes. A whitish tongue licked at the corners of her mouth. A pretty, spoiled and not very bright little girl who had gone very, very wrong, and nobody was doing anything about it. To hell with the rich. They made me sick. I rolled a cigarette in my fingers and pushed some books out of the way and sat on the end of the black desk. I lit my cigarette, puffed a plume of smoke and watched the thumb and tooth act for a while in silence. Carmen stood in front of me, like a bad girl in the principal's office.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那女孩和我站在那儿面面相觑，她努力想保持住一丝可爱的笑容，但她的脸已经太累了，没这份耐心。所以她仍旧面无表情。她的笑转瞬即逝，犹如海水冲刷走沙滩上的痕迹，她痴呆愚蠢的空洞眼睛下是苍白的皮肤，带着粗糙的颗粒质地。一条泛白的舌头舔着嘴角。这是个被宠坏的漂亮小姑娘，脑子不太灵光，明明犯了大错，却没人采取任何措施。有钱人都去死吧。他们令我恶心。我手指间翻转着一根香烟，推开挡道的几本书，坐在那张黑色书桌的一头。我点上烟，吞云吐雾，静静看着她啃了一会儿拇指。卡门站在我面前，就像一个坏女孩站在校长办公室里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I pushed her to one side and put the key in the door and opened it and pushed her in through it. I shut the door again and stood there sniffing. The place was horrible by daylight. The Chinese junk on the walls, the rug, the fussy lamps, the teakwood stuff, the sticky riot of colors, the totem pole, the flagon of ether and laudanum -- all this in the daytime had a stealthy nastiness, like a fag party.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我把她推到一边，拿钥匙开了门，推她进屋。我重新关上门，站在那儿闻着。阳光照射下，那地方很可怕。墙上的中国旧货，地毯，花里胡哨的台灯，柚木家具，难分难解的各种颜色，图腾柱，盛放乙醚和鸦片酊的大肚瓶——白昼里的这一切透着一股见不得人的肮脏，好比一场同性恋派对。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She giggled. That gave me a nasty feeling. If she had screeched or wept or even nosedived to the floor in a dead faint, that would have been all right. She just giggled. It was suddenly a lot of fun. She had had her photo taken as Isis and somebody had swiped it and somebody had bumped Geiger off in front of her and she was drunker than a Legion convention, and it was suddenly a lot of nice clean fun. So she giggled. Very cute. The giggles got louder and ran around the corners of the room like rats behind the wainscoting. She started to go hysterical. I slid off the desk and stepped up close to her and gave her a smack on the side of the face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她咯咯笑了。这令我心生厌恶。她尖叫也好，大哭也罢，哪怕是一个猛子扎到地上昏死过去，都没问题。可她就是咯咯傻笑。她突然就觉得非常好玩。明明她在相机镜头里活像伊希斯[1]，照片也叫人偷走了，有人当着她的面打死了盖革，而且当时她醉得比聚会上的退伍军人还厉害，突然这一切竟成了乐趣十足的事了。所以她要咯咯笑。非常可爱。笑声益发响了，萦绕在房间四角，仿佛墙壁里乱窜的老鼠。她发起疯来。我飞快跳下书桌，走到她面前给了她一个耳刮子。【注：[1]Isis，古代埃及司生育和繁殖的女神。】">查看中文翻译</div>

Carmen stared back at me over her shoulder, her hand clutching the door knob, almost drooling with fear. The bell kept on ringing. Then the ringing stopped. A key tickled at the door and Carmen jumped away from it and stood frozen. The door swung open.
