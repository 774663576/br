<div class="line_en">It was nearly noon on the following day when Shasta was wakened by something warm and soft moving over his face. He opened his eyes and found himself staring into the long face of a horse; its nose and lips were almost touching his. He remembered the exciting events of the previous night and sat up. But as he did so he groaned.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Good morning, small one," said Bree. "I was afraid you might feel a bit stiff. It can't be the falls. You didn't have more than a dozen or so, and it was all lovely, soft springy turf that must have been almost a pleasure to fall on. And the only one that might have been nasty was broken by that gorse bush. No: it's the riding itself that comes hard at first. What about breakfast? I've had mine."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“早上好，小家伙，”布里说，“我但心你会觉得有点儿手脚僵硬。不可能是跌跤跌的。你不过跌了十二三回罢了，全都是在美丽可爱、柔软而有弹性的草皮上，跌在这种草皮上几乎是种赏心乐事。只有一回可能是别扭的，被荆棘的尖刺划破了。不，首先是骑马本身把你累垮了。你早餐吃什么呢，我可已经吃过早餐了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Ow, Bree," he gasped. "I'm so sore. All over. I can hardly move."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“唷，布里，”他气喘吁吁地说，“我痛得厉害。浑身疼痛。我动弹不了啦。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh bother breakfast. Bother everything," said Shasta. "I tell you I can't move." But the horse nuzzled at him with its nose and pawed him gently with a hoof till he had to get up. And then he looked about him and saw where they were. Behind them lay a little copse. Before them the turf, dotted with white flowers, sloped down to the brow of a cliff. Far below them, so that the sound of the breaking waves was very faint, lay the sea. Shasta had never seen it from such a height and never seen so much of it before, nor dreamed how many colours it had. On either hand the coast stretched away, headland after headland, and at the points you could see the white foam running up the rocks but making no noise because it was so far off. There were gulls flying overhead and the heat shivered on the ground; it was a blazing day. But what Shasta chiefly noticed was the air. He couldn't think what was missing, until at last he realized that there was no smell of fish in it. For of course, neither in the cottage nor among the nets, had he ever been away from that smell in his life. And this new air was so delicious, and all his old life seemed so far away, that he forgot for a moment about his bruises and his aching muscles and said: "I say, Bree, didn't you say something about breakfast?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“呀，讨厌的早餐，讨厌的切一切，”沙斯塔说，“我告诉你我动弹不了啦。”但马儿用它的鼻子擦他，用它的蹄子温柔地搔他，他终于只好起来了。接着他向四周瞧瞧，看看他们是在什么地方。他们的后边是一个小灌木林，他们的前面是缀着白花的草皮，往下绵延到一个悬崖的顶。在他们的下方远处，躺着大海，海涛的冲击声十分微弱。沙斯塔以前从来没有在那么高的地方看过大海，他既没有看到过那么辽阔的大海，连做梦也没梦见过大海竟有那么多色彩。海岸从两边伸展开去，海岬紧接着海岬，你看得见海岬尖端海浪冲在岩石上溅起的白色泡沫，声音可听不到了，因为距离太远了。海鸥在头上飞翔，热气在地上哆嗦，这是一个烈日炎炎的日子。但沙斯塔主要注意的是空气，他想不起来缺少点儿什么，最后才恍然大悟，空气中没有鱼腥味了。因为在他的生活里，不论待在房屋里还是待在渔网之间，当然都离不开鱼腥味儿。这儿清新的空气是那么美妙，他的一切旧生活便仿佛是那么遥远了，因而他暂时忘掉了他的伤痕和疼痛的肌肉。他说道：“喂，布里，你没提起过吃早餐的事吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes, I did," answered Bree. "I think you'll find something in the saddle-bags. They're over there on that tree where you hung them up last night -- or early this morning, rather."</div>

<div class="line_en">They investigated the saddle-bags and the results were cheering -- a meat pasty, only slightly stale, a lump of dried figs and another lump of green cheese, a little flask of wine, and some money; about forty crescents in all, which was more than Shasta had ever seen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们查看了鞍囊，结果令人很是高兴一块肉馅饼，只是稍稍有点儿干瘪走味，一大堆无花果干，大块发绿的干酪，小瓶酒：还有一些钱，总共大约四十个克利申光景，沙斯塔迹从来没有见过这么多的钱呢。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“花掉这笔钱，岂不是偷窃行为吗？”沙斯塔问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh," said the Horse, looking up with its mouth full of grass, "I never thought of that. A free horse and a talking horse mustn't steal, of course. But I think it's all right. We're prisoners and captives in enemy country. That money is booty, spoil. Besides, how are we to get any food for you without it? I suppose, like all humans, you won't eat natural food like grass and oats."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，”马儿满口青草，抬起头来，“我从来没考虑这个问题。一匹自由的马，匹能说话的马，当然绝不应偷窃。但我认为我们花掉这钱也是对的。我们是在敌国做囚徒和俘虏。这笔钱是缴获品，战利品。再说呢，没有这笔钱，我们怎么去搞到你吃的东西呢7我想，你像所有的人一样，是不肯吃草和燕麦之类的天然食物的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我看起来丝毫也不可笑。”布里说道。但这当儿它却突然翻身侧卧，抬起头来，紧瞅着沙斯塔，还稍稍有点儿气喘。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Shasta had finished his breakfast (which was by far the nicest he had ever eaten), Bree said, "I think I'll have a nice roll before we put on that saddle again." And he proceeded to do so. "That's good. That's very good," he said, rubbing his back on the turf and waving all four legs in the air. "You ought to have one too, Shasta," he snorted. "It's most refreshing."</div>

It would be dreadful to find, when I get back to Narnia, that I've picked up a lot of low, bad habits. What do you think, Shasta? Honestly, now. Don't spare my feelings. Should you think the real, free horses -- the talking kind -- do roll?"</div>

<div class="line_en">These were great days for Shasta, and every day better than the last as his muscles hardened and he fell less often. Even at the end of his training Bree still said he sat like a bag of flour in the saddle. "And even if it was safe, young 'un, I'd be ashamed to be seen with you on the main road." But in spite of his rude words Bree was a patient teacher. No one can teach riding so well as a horse. Shasta learned to trot, to canter, to jump, and to keep his seat even when Bree pulled up suddenly or swung unexpectedly to the left or the right -- which, as Bree told him, was a thing you might have to do at any moment in a battle. And then of course Shasta begged to be told of the battles and wars in which Bree had carried the Tarkaan. And Bree would tell of forced marches and the fording of swift rivers, of charges and of fierce fights between cavalry and cavalry when the war horses fought as well as the men, being all fierce stallions, trained to bite and kick, and to rear at the right moment so that the horse's weight as well as the rider's would come down on a enemy's crest in the stroke of sword or battleaxe. But Bree did not want to talk about the wars as often as Shasta wanted to hear about them. "Don't speak of them, youngster," he would say. "They were only the Tisroc's wars and I fought in them as a slave and a dumb beast. Give me the Narnian wars where I shall fight as a free Horse among my own people! Those will be wars worth talking about. Narnia and the North! Bra-ha-ha! Broo hoo!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对沙斯塔说来，这几天真是了不得的日子，而且一天好似一天，因为他的肌肉都比较结实了，摔下马来的次数也少了。甚至训练已经结束了，布里还是说他坐在马鞍子上像一袋面粉。“哪怕你是坐稳了，小家伙，在大路上被人看见你坐在我身上，我真是感到羞耻。”尽管布里言语粗鲁生硬，它还足个有耐心的教练。没有人教授骑马术能像一匹马儿那样教得地道了。沙斯塔学会了骑马小跑、骑马慢跑和骑马跳跃，即使布里突然停下或出乎意外地左右摇晃——布里告诉他，在一场战斗中，随时都可能非做出这种动作不可——他仍能稳如泰山地坐在鞍座上。当然啦，沙斯塔这就恳求布里讲讲那些它驮着泰坎所参加的战斗和战争。布里便讲起急行军、涉水强渡激流、骑兵和骑兵之间的冲锋与恶战，这当儿战马跟士兵样拼命战斗，它们都是凶猛的公马，训练得能咬善踢，并且在恰当的时刻用后腿站将起来，使得剑或斧向敌人猛砍过去时，马和骑兵的全部重量都压在对手的头盔上。但布里不肯像沙斯塔希望的那样时常讲起打仗的事。“别提那些了，小家伙。”它总是说，“那都是蒂斯罗克的战争，我只是作为一个奴隶和匹哑巴牲口参加战争的。让我参加纳尼亚的战争，我就将在我自己的人民中间，作为一匹自由的马儿去作战。这些才是值得谈论的战争。纳尼亚和北方布拉哈一晗I布鲁一胡！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After they had travelled on for weeks and weeks past more bays and headlands and rivers and villages than Shasta could remember, there came a moonlit night when they started their journey at evening, having slept during the day. They had left the downs behind them and were crossing a wide plain with a forest about half a mile away on their left. The sea, hidden by low sandhills, was about the same distance on their right. They had jogged along for about an hour, sometimes trotting and sometimes walking, when Bree suddenly stopped.</div>

<div class="line_en">Bree only snorted in answer but he did sheer away to his right. Oddly enough the other horse seemed also to be sheering away to the left, so that in a few seconds the space between them had widened a good deal. But as soon as it did so there came two more lions' roars, immediately after one another, one on the right and the other on the left, the horses began drawing nearer together. So, apparently, did the lions. The roaring of the brutes on each side was horribly close and they seemed to be keeping up with the galloping horses quite easily. Then the cloud rolled away. The moonlight, astonishingly bright, showed up everything almost as if it were broad day. The two horses and two riders were galloping neck to neck and knee to knee just as if they were in a race. Indeed Bree said (afterwards) that a finer race had never been seen in Calormen.</div>

<div class="line_en">Something flat and shining was spread out before them. Before Shasta had time even to guess what it was there was a great splash and he found his mouth half full of salt water. The shining thing had been a long inlet of the sea. Both horses were swimming and the water was up to Shasta's knees. There was an angry roaring behind them and looking back Shasta saw a great, shaggy, and terrible shape crouched on the water's edge; but only one. "We must have shaken off the other lion," he thought.</div>

They remembered the very same places in Narnia -- "the grasslands up above Beaversdam" and found that they were some sort of second cousins once removed.
