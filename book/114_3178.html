<div class="line_en">This brings me to the story of his love. Remember the unspeakably awful Cornelius? I saw him and spoke to him myself, as he crept around Patusan with evil in his heart, and lying promises on his lips. How his poor wife had come to marry him is a mystery to me. I do not know, either, what had happened to her daughter's father, who was not Cornelius. The fact remains that she already had her daughter when she married the Portuguese. Bitterly disappointed with his life, he seemed to hate the woman and her child, and behaved very badly to both of them. The two women lived very lonely lives at the trading-post, with no other friends or companions. When the older woman died, a short time before Jim's arrival, the daughter was lonelier than ever.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jim decided to leave Doramin's place after only a few days there, and move into the house at the trading-post, where Cornelius and the girl lived. Although Doramin warned him this would be dangerous, Jim felt it was his duty to take care of Stein's business. At first Cornelius pretended to be delighted that Jim was staying with him, but he soon showed his real character. Jim realized that Cornelius had been stealing from Stein at every opportunity. There seemed to be almost nothing left of the business, and some of the papers were missing.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Call me father, and with respect, too," he used to scream into her face. "Your mother was an evil woman, and you're evil as well!" The girl usually put her hands over her ears and ran away, while Cornelius chased her, shouting wildly and often throwing dirt at her. But sometimes she used to listen in silence, staring scornfully at him and replying with a poisonous word or two. Jim told me he could not leave the house while the poor girl was so unhappy; his conscience would not let him. But every day he received another message that there were plans to drown, shoot or poison him, and he realized he was in great danger. He no longer slept well at night. He noticed that Cornelius was acting very strangely, giving hesitating answers to Jim's questions, creeping secretly round the house in the dark, and having mysterious meetings with people at night.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“尊敬地叫我父亲，”他过去常常对着女孩大叫，“你妈妈是个坏女人，你也一样！”女孩总是捂着耳朵跑掉。科尼利厄斯去追她，边跑边疯狂地叫喊，还常常用难听的话骂她。有时她会安静地听着，藐视地瞪着他，用一两个恶毒的词回敬他。吉姆告诉我，这个可怜的女孩过得太苦了，他不能在这个时候离开；良心不允许他这样做。但每天他都会听到一些新的消息，说有人计划淹死他、枪击他或对他下毒，他意识到自己正面临很大的危险，晚上也睡不好觉了。吉姆注意到科尼利厄斯行为古怪，回答他的问题时总是支支吾吾的，还在夜里偷偷摸摸地在房子里走动，神秘地跟什么人见面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It was miserable there," Jim told me. "Cornelius was too mean to give me any regular meals. And then I heard the Rajah was planning to murder me! Pleasant, wasn't it?" He added that he didn't know what made him stay there for six weeks, but of course we can guess. He was very sorry for the motherless girl. It appears Cornelius frequently shouted at her, although he was too cowardly to hit her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“在那儿的日子糟透了，”吉姆告诉我，“科尼利厄斯太吝啬，连我的一日三餐都不保证。接着我又听说王公计划杀我！真不错，是不是？”他还说他不知道为什么在那儿待了六个星期，但我们可以去猜测。这是因为他可怜那个失去母亲的女孩。科尼利厄斯虽然没有胆量打她，但总是向她大吼大叫。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I met the girl, of course, on my visit. She had a child's sensitive face, and moved quickly and lightly, like a little bird. Her skin was smooth and her hair a deep blue-black, flowing thickly on to her lovely shoulders. She spoke and understood quite a lot of English, and used to listen carefully to our conversations, keeping her big clear eyes fastened on our lips. Her love for Jim surrounded him completely; I felt I could almost touch it. I suppose you think I, too, am romantic, but I'm just telling you what I saw. I realized she loved him deeply and jealously, but what she was jealous of, I did not know. After all, the land, the people, the forests were on her side, guarding Jim day and night and keeping him prisoner. Even Tamb'Itam, ready to die for the Tuan, was proud to guard Jim. And the girl herself, I believe, never went to sleep until Jim and I had separated for the night. More than once I saw her and Jim, through the window of my room, stand quietly together on the veranda -- two figures very close, his arm around her waist, her head on his shoulder.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，我去拜访吉姆时也看见了这个女孩。她有一张孩子般生动的脸，动作如小鸟般敏捷轻盈。她皮肤光滑，头发浓密，呈深深的蓝黑色，柔顺地落在漂亮的肩膀上。她能说也能听懂很多英文，她总是用心听我们的谈话，大而清澈的眼睛一直盯着我们的嘴唇。吉姆被她的爱完全包围了；我觉得自己几乎可以触摸到这种爱。我猜你们认为我也很浪漫，但我只是告诉你们我看到的事实。我知道她深爱着他，唯恐失去他，但我不知道她担心什么。毕竟，这片土地、这些人以及这片森林都站在她一边，日夜守着吉姆，囚禁着他。甚至连乐意为图安而死的坦比坦也为守卫吉姆而自豪。我相信，每天晚上，女孩直到看见吉姆和我告别才去睡。不止一次，我从房间的窗户看见她和吉姆一起安静地站在阳台上——两个身影靠得很近，他用胳膊搂着她的腰，她把头靠在他肩膀上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The three men walked in front, followed by Jim and the girl, until they reached the river. "Jump!" shouted Jim, and the men jumped. Jim watched them swim into the distance. He turned to the girl. His heart seemed suddenly to grow too big for his chest, and he was unable to speak. They looked at each other for a long time, then she threw the burning torch far into the river. The calm soft starlight came down on them; it was one of those nights that seem made for love. I don't suppose he could express himself very well, but there are moments when our souls need silence more than words.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="三个男子走在前面，吉姆和女孩走在后面，一直走到河边。“跳下去！”吉姆大声命令，那几个人跳进河里。吉姆看着他们游到远处，然后转过身，面朝女孩。他的心脏似乎突然胀大了，仿佛就要冲出胸口，他说不出话来。他们彼此对视了很久，然后她把燃着的火把远远地扔进河里。宁静柔和的星光照在他们身上；这样的夜晚正是为爱营造的。我想吉姆不大善于表达，但有些时候，灵魂更需要沉默，而非言语。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He called her Jewel. Pretty, isn't it? A strange name, of course, but it probably explained the surprising story I had heard on my way to Patusan, in a village about three hundred kilometres south of there. Local people told me that the mysterious white stranger who had taken control of the area had discovered a very large and valuable jewel. As he was often seen walking with a girl, behaving with great respect and care towards her, it was supposed that she wore the white man's jewel hidden in her dress. It was true that Jim took the girl on evening walks, and that romance had taken hold of him, but the rest of the story was just imagination. He did not hide his jewel; in fact, he was extremely proud of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他叫她宝石。很美吧？这个名字固然奇怪，但它或许解释了我在去帕图桑的路上，在那以南三百公里的村子里听到的令人惊讶的故事。当地人告诉我，控制这片土地的神秘白人发现了一颗很大、很贵重的宝石。因为人们常看见他和一位女孩走在一起，对她很敬重，很关心，所以猜测女孩的衣服里藏着这位白人的宝石。吉姆确实常在晚上带着女孩去散步，而且心中充满对她的爱，但故事剩下的部分仅仅是人们的想象。他没有把宝石藏起来；实际上，他对此很自豪。">查看中文翻译</div>

And I will! You know, I've been here only two years now, and I really can t imagine living anywhere else. The thought of the world outside is enough to frighten me, because --" and he looked down at his boots "-- I haven't forgotten why I came here. Not yet!" We walked by the river in silence for a few moments. "Isn't it strange that all these people, who would do anything for me, will never understand? If you asked them who is brave, who is faithful, who they would trust with their lives… They would say, Tuan Jim. But they can never know the real, real truth." He paused again. "It doesn't matter. I am -- almost -- happy with what I've done. And they believe in me -- that's what they've done for me. I shall always remain here."</div>

She wanted something simple but impossible -- a promise, an explanation. Because she had grown up in Patusan and knew nothing of the strange world outside, her one great fear was that Jim, who had come from there, would one day return to it. She had watched us closely and listened to all our conversations, afraid perhaps that I was planning to take Jim away from her. And now she spoke to me, desperate to know what her fate would be. I was deeply touched by her helplessness; she was young, beautiful, and very unhappy.</div>

<div class="line_en">But none of that mattered. You see, I had decided that Jim, who was the only one I really cared about, had at last taken control of his fate. He had told me he was -- almost -- happy with what he'd done. Not many of us can say that. Can any of you here? No, I thought not. So it did not matter who trusted him, who loved him, who hated him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但这些都不重要。你们知道，我已经确定吉姆，我唯一真正关心的人，已经最终掌握了他的命运。他告诉我，他对自己所做的基本上感到很高兴。我们中没有多少人敢这么说的。你们当中有谁可以吗？我认为没有。所以谁信任他，谁爱他，谁恨他，这些都不重要。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"That man Cornelius hates you," I said, remembering a recent conversation with the Portuguese. "He thinks you've stolen everything from him. He could be dangerous."</div>

<div class="line_en">The next morning Jim came with me on the first part of my journey out of Patusan. As our canoe moved fast down the river, the trading-post and the houses disappeared behind us.</div>

<div class="line_en">"This is wonderful!" I cried, then looked at the unfortunate man beside me. He sat with his head bent low on his chest, and did not look up, perhaps afraid to see what his romantic conscience had written on the clear sky.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“太美了！”我大声说，然后看了看我身边那个不幸的人。他坐在那儿，头低低地埋在胸口，没有抬头，也许是害怕晴空让他想起浪漫旧梦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The air was hot and heavy, and smelt of mud. We were silent for a time, knowing we would separate soon. Suddenly the sky seemed to widen, there was a freshness in the air, and at last we were out of the jungle. Ahead of us was the open sea. I breathed deeply, I felt free again. The girl was right. There was a sign, a call from the wider world outside, for me!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="空气闷热，带着泥土的气味。我们知道很快就要分别了，所以有一会儿没有说话。突然，天宽地阔，空气也变得新鲜起来，我们终于出了丛林，前面就是开阔的大海了。我深吸了一口气，觉得又重获自由了。那位女孩是对的。外面的宽阔世界在召唤着我。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I remember the smallest details of that afternoon. We landed on a white beach, near the mouth of the river, to wait for my ship. Two natives came to tell Jim that the Rajah's men were stealing their eggs. He told them gently to wait, and they sat down obediently on the ground.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我还记得那天下午的一点一滴。我们在靠近入海口的一片白色海滩上岸，等待我的船开过来。两个当地人过来，告诉吉姆王公的人偷他们的鸡蛋。他和气地让他们等一等，他们于是顺从地在地上坐下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You see, I can't go away," he said to me. "The people here need me now. They would fight among themselves if I left. I must stay. I shall be faithful." I remembered Stein's words -- follow the dream, to the end. "And there's Jewel," he went on. "She's everything to me. When shall you and I meet again, I wonder?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你看，我不能走，”他对我说。“这儿的人需要我。我走了他们会自相残杀。我必须留下。我应当守信。”我记起了斯坦的话——追逐梦想，直到最后。“而且宝石在这儿，”他接着说，“她是我的一切。不知道你我什么时候能再见面啊。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Goodbye, then," he said after a pause. "Perhaps it's best this way." We shook hands, and I walked to the ship's boat, which by now was waiting for me in shallow water.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那么，再见了，”他停顿了一下说，“也许这是最好的结局。”我们握了握手，我走向正在浅水中等我的小船。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"In a year or so, if I am alive then," I said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“大概一年后．如果我那个时候还活着的话。”我说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Never -- unless you come out," I replied. He didn't seem very surprised. He was quiet for a while.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“永远不会了——除非你出来。”我回答。他并没有流露出惊讶的神色，只是沉默了一会儿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Will you go home again soon?" asked Jim, just as I was getting in.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你会很快回家吗？”我上船的时候吉姆问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The boat started moving away from the beach. Jim, at the water's edge, spoke louder. "Tell them…" he began. I ordered the boatmen to stop rowing, and waited. Tell who? "No-nothing," he said, and waved us away. I did not look at the beach again until I had climbed on board the ship.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小船离海滩越来越远了。吉姆站在海边，大声说：“告诉他们……”我让划船的人停下来，等着他把话说完。告诉谁？“没有——没什么。”他说着，挥手让我们离去。我直到登上大船的甲板才回头向海滩望去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">By that time the sun had gone down and the coast looked very black, but I could still see Jim on the beach. The two natives were standing close to him, no doubt telling the white lord about their miserable, difficult lives, and he was listening patiently. They soon disappeared in the growing darkness, but Jim remained, white from head to foot. He had the sea at his feet, and the opportunity by his side -- still hidden from him. What do you think, my friends? Was it still hidden? For me that white figure in the stillness of coast and sea seemed to stand at the heart of a great mystery, catching all the light left in a darkened world… And then, suddenly, I lost him…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="太阳落山了，海边一片黑暗，但我看见吉姆还在那里。那两个当地人紧靠他站着，一定是在向这位白人老爷讲述他们悲惨、困苦的生活。吉姆耐心地聆听着。天色越来越暗，很快就看不到他俩了，但吉姆还在那儿，从头到脚都是白的。大海在他脚边，机会在他身旁——仍不清晰。你们怎么认为，我的朋友们？它还隐匿着吗？对我而言，那个站在宁静海岸上的白色身影似乎处在一个巨大的神秘事物的中心，抓住黯淡世界残留下来的所有光亮……然后，突然，我看不到他了……">查看中文翻译</div>
