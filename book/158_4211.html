<div class="line_en">They were still full of sleep, and shivering with cold under their wraps. They could only see each other dimly in the obscure light, and the accumulation of heavy winter garments made them all resemble fat cu-rates in long cassocks. Only two of the men were acquainted; a third accosted them and they chatted:"I'm going to take my wife," said one.</div>

<div class="line_en">At half past four in the morning, the travelers met in the courtyard of Hotel Normandie, where they were to take the carriage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在午前4点半光景，旅客们都到了诺曼底旅馆的天井里，那就是他们上车的地方。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The first added:"We shall not return to Rouen, and if the Prussians approach Havre, we shall go over to England. "All had the same projects, being of the same mind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那一个接着又说：“我们将来不回卢昂了，并且设若普鲁士人向哈佛尔走，我们将来到英国去。”由于品质相类，他们都有了相同的计划。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As yet the horses were not harnessed. A little lantern, carried by a stable boy, went out one door from time to time, to immediately appear at another. The feet of the horses striking the floor could be heard, al-though deadened by the straw and litter, and the voice of a man talking to the beasts, sometimes swearing, came from the end of the building. A light tinkling of bells announced that they were taking down the harness; this murmur soon became a clear and continuous rhythm by the movement of the animal, stopping some-times, then breaking into a brusque shake which was accompanied by the dull stamp of a sabot upon the hard earth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时候，却还没有人套车。一间乌黑的房子里的门开了，一个手提小风灯的马夫时而走出来，时而又立刻走进另一间屋子里。许多马蹄蹄着地面，不过地面上的厩草减轻了马蹄的声音，一阵向牲口说话和叱骂的人声从屋子的尽头传出来了。接着一阵轻微的铃子声音丁零地响着，那就是报告有人正触动到马的—辔；那种丁零的响声不久变成了一阵清脆而连续的颤抖，随着牲口的动作而变化，有时候却也停止一下，随即又在一种突然而起的动摇当中再响起来，同着一只蹄铁扑着地面的沉闷声音一齐传到了外面。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The door suddenly closed. All noise ceased. The frozen citizens were silent; they remained immovable and stiff.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="门突然关上了。一切响声都停止了。那些冻僵了的市民都不说话了；他们都像僵了一般待着没有动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The man reappeared with his lantern, pulling at the end of a rope a sad horse which would not come willingly. He placed him against the pole, fastened the traces, walked about a long time adjusting the harness, for he had the use of but one hand, the other carrying the lantern. As he went for the second horse, he noticed the travelers, motionless, already white with snow, and said to them:"Why not get into the carriage? You will be under cover, at least."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那个马夫又带着风灯出来了，手里紧紧地牵着一匹不很愿意出来的可怜的马。他把牲口靠近了车辕，系好了挽革，前前后后长久地瞧了一番去拴紧牲口身上的各种马具，因为他一只手已经拿着风灯，所以他只有另一只手可以做事，他去牵第二匹马了，这时候他才注意到那些毫不动弹的旅客，发现他们已经浑身全是雪白的，于是说道：“各位为什么不上车，至少那是有遮盖的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A curtain of uninterrupted white flakes constantly sparkled in its descent to the ground. It effaced forms, and powdered everything with a downy moss. And nothing could be heard in the great silence. The town was calm, and buried under the wintry frost, as this fall of snow, unnamable and floating, a sensation rather than a sound (trembling atoms which only seem to fill all space), came to cover the earth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="连绵不断的雪片像一面帏幕似的往地面上直落，同时耀出回光；它隐没着种种物体的外表，在那上面撒着一层冰苔；在这个宁静而且被严寒埋没的市区的深邃沉寂当中，人都只听见那种雪片儿落下来的飘忽模糊无从称呼的摩擦声息，说声息吗，不如说是感觉，不如说是微尘的交错活动仿佛充塞了空中，又遮盖了大地。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They had evidently not thought of it, and they hastened to do so. The three men installed their wives at the back and then followed them. Then the other forms, undecided and veiled, took in their turn the last places without exchanging a word.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们以前无疑地没有想到这一层，现在他们都赶忙向车子走。三个男旅客把他们的妻子都安排在顶前头的位子，自己都跟着上来；随后，另外那些遮头盖面的轮廓模糊的旅客彼此没有交谈一句话，就都坐在剩下来的位子上了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Finally, the carriage was harnessed with six horses instead of four. because the traveling was very bad, and a voice called out:</div>

<div class="line_en">The floor was covered with straw, in which the feet ensconced themselves. The ladies at the back having brought little copper foot stoves, with a carbon fire, lighted them and for some time, in low voices, enumerated the advantages of the appliances, repeating things that they had known for a long time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="车里的地下铺着些麦秸，旅客们的脚都藏在那里边了。那些坐在顶前头的女客都带着那种装好化学炭饼的铜质手炉，烧燃了这种东西，便低声慢气地举出它的种种好处，互相重复地叙述那她们早已知道的事物。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They were off. The carriage moved slowly, slowly for a little way. The wheels were imbedded in the snow; the whole body groaned with heavy cracking sounds; the horses glistened, puffed, and smoked; and the great whip of the driver snapped without ceasing, hovering about on all sides, knotting and unrolling itself like a thin serpent, lashing brusquely some horse on the rebound, which then put forth its most violent effort.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大家起程了。车子走得慢而又慢，简直全是小步儿。轮子隐到了雪里；整个车厢轧轧地呻吟着，牲口滑着，喘着，都是汗气蒸腾的。赶车的手里那根长鞭子不住地噼噼啪啪响着，向各方面飞扬，如同一条细蛇样地扭成一个结子又散开，陡然鞭着一匹牲口蹶起的臀部，马受到狠狠的一击，紧张地奔跑起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now the day was imperceptibly dawning. The light flakes, which one of the travelers, a Rouenese by birth, said looked like a shower of cotton, no longer fell. A faint light filtered through the great dull clouds, which rendered more brilliant the white of the fields, where appeared a line of great trees clothed in whiteness, or a chimney with a cap of snow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是天色不知不觉一步比一步亮起来了。那阵曾经被一个纯粹卢昂土著的旅客比成棉雨的雪片儿已经不下了。一阵昏浊的微光从雪堆儿里漏出来，云是在而密的，它使得那片平原，那片忽而有一行披着雪衣的大树忽而有一个顶着雪盔的茅屋的平原，显得更其耀眼。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">His reputation as a sharper was so well established that one evening at the residence of the prefect, Mr. Tournel, author of some fables and songs, of keen, satirical mind, a local celebrity, having proposed to some ladies, who seemed to be getting a little sleepy, that they make up a game of"Loiseau tricks, the joke traversed the rooms of the prefect, reached those of the town, and then, in the months to come, made many a face in the province expand with laughter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的偷偷摸摸的名声是人人皆知的，以至于某天晚上都尔内先生在州长的客厅里，使用同意异义的字眼把他这个用“鸟”字做姓的人作为戏谑的对象，都尔内先生是个寓言和歌曲的作家，文笔辛辣而且细腻，是地方上的一种光荣；那天晚上他看见女宾们都像要打瞌睡，就提议来做“鸟翩跹”的游戏；有人从他的语气之间懂得他想说的原是鸟骗钱，这句话就此自动穿过州长的客厅飞到了市区的各处客厅里，使全省的人张大嘴巴整整地笑了一个月。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Loiseau was especially known for his love of farce of every kind, for his jokes, good and bad; and no one could ever talk with him without thinking:"He is in-valuable, this Loiseau. "Of tall figure, his balloon-shaped front was surmounted by a ruddy face surrounded by gray whiskers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此外，鸟先生是以种种性质的恶作剧，善意的或者恶意的笑谈而出名的；只要谈到他，谁也不能不立即加上这么一句：“他是妙不可言的，这鸟。”他身躯很矮，腆着一个气球样的大肚子，顶着一副夹在两撮灰白长髯中间的赭色脸儿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At the back, in the best places, Mr. Loiseau, wholesale merchant of wine, of Grand-Pont street, and Mrs. Loiseau were sleeping opposite each other. Loiseau had bought out his former patron who failed in business, and made his fortune. He sold bad wine at a good price to small retailers in the country and passed among his friends and acquaintances as a knavish wag, a true Norman full of deceit and joviality.</div>

<div class="line_en">Beside them, Mr. Carré-Lamadon held himself with great dignity, as if belonging to a superior caste; a considerable man, in cottons, proprietor of three mills, officer of the Legion of Honor, and member of the General Council. He had remained, during the Empire, chief of the friendly opposition, famous for making the Emperor pay dearer for rallying to the cause than if he had combated it with blunted arms, according to his own story. Madame Carré-Lamadon, much younger than her husband, was the consolation of officers of good family sent to Rouen in garrison. She sat opposite her husband, very dainty, petite, and pretty, wrapped closely in furs and looking with sad eyes at the interior of the carriage.</div>

The Count, an old gentle-man of good figure, accentuated, by the artifices of his toilette, his resemblance to King Henry IV., who, following a glorious legend of the family, had impregnated one of the De Breville ladies, whose husband, for this reason, was made a count and governor of the province.</div>
