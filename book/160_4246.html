<div class="line_en">The following day was dull and foggy. The Hall was surrounded by heavy, low clouds, which opened now and then to show the grim, cold moor and its wet, grey rocks. The weather made us miserable. It was difficult to be cheerful when we felt danger all around us. I thougth of Sir Charles death, and the awful sound of the hound, which I had now heard twice. Holmes did not believe that there was a supernatural hound. But facts are facts, and I had heard a hound. Was there a huge hound living on the moor? If so, where could it hide? Where did it get its food? Why was it never seen by day? It was almost as difficult to accept a natural explanation as a supernatural explanation.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I promise he won't break into any house," said Barrymore, "and he won't cause any trouble. In a few days he will catch a boat for South America. Please don't tell the police about him. If you tell the police, my wife and I will be in serious trouble."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, Sir Charles got a letter on the morning of the day he died. It was from Newtown, and the address was in a woman's writing. I forgot all about it, but some time after Sir Charles died my wife was cleaning the fireplace in his study. She found a letter. Most of it was burned, but the bottom of one page was not burned. On it was written: "Please, please, burn this letter, and be at the gate by ten o'clock. L. L." The paper fell into pieces as my wife went to move it. We don't know who L. L. is, but if you could find out, you might learn more about Sir Charles death. We haven't told anyone else. We felt it would not be good for poor, kind Sir Charles. But we thought we ought to tell you, Sir Henry."</div>

Her father will not speak to her, because she married against his wishes. So her husband and her father have made her life very unhappy."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，”摩梯末医生讲道。“劳拉曾和一位名叫莱昂丝的、到沼地写生的画家结了婚。但是他对她很残暴，不日之后还离开了她。她父亲坚决和她不讲话了，因为她当时是违背父亲的意愿而结的婚。因此，她的丈夫和她的父亲已使她的生活非常不幸福。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No, sir, but Selden told me about him a week or more ago. He is hiding from someone, too, but he is not an escaped prisoner. I don't like it, sir. Something evil is going to happen, I'm sure. Sir Henry would be much safer in London."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没有，先生，但是塞尔登大约在一周之前或是更早些时告诉了我有关他的情况。他也在躲藏着呢，但是他并不是个逃犯。我并不喜欢这种局势，先生。我敢肯定，这儿将要发生一件邪恶的事情。亨利爵爷在伦敦则要安全得多。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I thanked him, and he left me. I went to the window and looked out at the rain and the clouds. It was a wild night. I knew the huts Barrymore had spoken about. There were many of them on the moor. They had been built many hundreds of years ago by the people who lived on the moor. They would not keep a man warm and dry in bad weather. Selden could not choose to live anywhere else, but why did the other man live in such conditions?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我谢过了他，他就走开了。我走到窗前，望着屋外的雨和云彩。这是个暴风雨夜。我知道白瑞摩谈及的那些石屋。沼地上有许多石屋。它们是在数百年前由住在沼地上的那些人们修建的，天气恶劣时不可能不让里边的住户感到又冷又潮。塞尔登是别无他处可住才呆在那儿的，但是另外那个人为何要居住在那么恶劣的条件下呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He looked like a gentleman. He was living in one of the old stone huts on the moor. A boy works for him and brings him all the food and things he needs. That"s all Selden told me."</div>

<div class="line_en">I sat and thought what I should do next. I decided I must try to find the man who had been watching us. Was he the enemy who had been following us since the very beginning in London? If he was, and I could catch him, perhaps our difficulties would be at an end.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我坐下来，思考着我下一步的举动。我已决定了，我一定要竭力找到一直监视着我们的那个人。他是那个从伦敦便开始跟踪着我们的敌人吗？如果是的话，如果我能将其抓获的话，那么我们的困境也许就到头了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I also decided to hunt the man on my own. Sir Henry was still shaken by the terrible cry we had heard on the moor. I did not want to add to his troubles or to lead him into more danger.</div>
