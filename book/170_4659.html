<div class="line_en">Three tallow candles burned upon her windowsill to keep the terrors of the night at bay. Four more flickered beside her bed, two to either side. In the hearth a fire was kept burning day and night. The first lesson those who would serve her had to learn was that the fire must never, ever be allowed to go out.</div>

<div class="line_en">Visions danced before her, gold and scarlet, flickering, forming and melting and dissolving into one another, shapes strange and terrifying and seductive. She saw the eyeless faces again, staring out at her from sockets weeping blood. Then the towers by the sea, crumbling as the dark tide came sweeping over them, rising from the depths. Shadows in the shape of skulls, skulls that turned to mist, bodies locked together in lust, writhing and rolling and clawing. Through curtains of fire great winged shadows wheeled against a hard blue sky.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在她面前，忽隐忽现的幻象在火焰中摇曳着，一个幻象刚成形，又开始消融，渐隐成另外一个；颜色忽而金黄，忽而猩红；形状忽而怪异，忽而恐怖，忽而魅惑，她再一次看到一张张挖去眼珠的脸，空洞的眼窝泣着鲜血，盯着她看。然后是一座海边的塔楼，被从深渊中涌起的狂暴的黑潮冲垮，淹没。一个个骷髅形的暗影在飞舞，又消散成迷雾，一具具躯体饥渴地纠缠在一起，扭动着，翻滚着，撕扯着。透过火焰的帷幕，她看到一只只长着巨大双翼的暗影盘旋着，飞向瓦蓝瓦蓝的天空。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The red priestess closed her eyes and said a prayer, then opened them once more to face the hearthfire. One more time. She had to be certain. Many a priest and priestess before her had been brought down by false visions, by seeing what they wished to see instead of what the Lord of Light had sent. Stannis was marching south into peril, the king who carried the fate of the world upon his shoulders, Azor Ahai reborn. Surely R'hllor would vouchsafe her a glimpse of what awaited him. Show me Stannis, Lord, she prayed. Show me your king, your instrument.</div>

<div class="line_en">Skulls. A thousand skulls, and the bastard boy again. Jon Snow. Whenever she was asked what she saw within her fires, Melisandre would answer, "Much and more," but seeing was never as simple as those words suggested. It was an art, and like all arts it demanded mastery, discipline, study. Pain. That too. R'hllor spoke to his chosen ones through blessed fire, in a language of ash and cinder and twisting flame that only a god could truly grasp. Melisandre had practiced her art for years beyond count, and she had paid the price. There was no one, even in her order, who had her skill at seeing the secrets half-revealed and half-concealed within the sacred flames.</div>

<div class="line_en">In truth, he was here because Melisandre had asked for him. The four eldest sons of Davos Seaworth had perished in the battle on the Blackwater, when the king's fleet had been consumed by green fire. Devan was the fifthborn and safer here with her than at the king's side. Lord Davos would not thank her for it, no more than the boy himself, but it seemed to her that Seaworth had suffered enough grief. Misguided as he was, his loyalty to Stannis could not be doubted. She had seen that in her flames.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其实（他啥过失都没有），他是梅丽珊卓从国王那儿要来的。黑水河一役，炼金术士的野火几乎焚毁了国王的整支舰队，戴佛斯·席渥斯在此役牺牲了的四个大儿子。戴冯是第五子，他在这里比随国王进军安全多了。戴冯是不会感谢她的，他父亲更加不会，但是戴佛斯·席渥斯不能再承受丧子之痛了，他已经承受得太多太多了。虽然席渥斯误入歧途（顽固地不信奉光之王），但是他对史坦尼斯的忠心是毋容置疑的。她早就在火焰中看见过了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">All the same, Devan was not pleased to be here. The lad had taken great pride in serving as a king's squire, and it had wounded him when Stannis commanded him to remain at Castle Black. Like any boy his age, his head was full of dreams of glory; no doubt he had been picturing the prowess he would display at Deepwood Motte. Other boys his age had gone south, to serve as squires to the king's knights and ride into battle at their side. Devan's exclusion must have seemed a rebuke, a punishment for some failure on his part, or perhaps for some failure of his father.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="即便如此，戴冯并不高兴待在这里。这孩子对国王侍从的身份极其自豪，当史坦尼斯命令他留守黑堡时，他的自尊心受到了极大的伤害。像同龄的男孩子一样，他满脑子都梦想着荣誉。毫无疑问，他一直在盘算着要在深林堡的战斗中展示出自己是多么的勇猛。（现在，）同龄的男孩子们，都随军南行了，他们都是国王的骑士们的侍从，他们会与骑士们并肩战斗。（而他戴冯却留守在这里，）他把留守看成是受了谴责和惩罚，他还以为他在侍奉国王时犯了什么过失，或者他父亲犯了什么过失呢。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Devan was quick and smart and able too, which was more than could be said about most of her attendants. Stannis had left a dozen of his men behind to serve her when he marched south, but most of them were useless. His Grace had need of every sword, so all he could spare were grey-beards and cripples. One man had been blinded by a blow to his head in the battle by the Wall, another lamed when his falling horse crushed his legs. Her serjeant had lost an arm to a giant's club. Three of her guard were geldings that Stannis had castrated for raping wildling women. She had two drunkards and a craven too. The last should have been hanged, as the king himself admitted, but he came from a noble family, and his father and brothers had been stalwart from the first.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="戴冯聪明伶俐还很能干，远远强过她的大部分侍从。史坦尼斯南行之前给她留了十二个手下作侍卫，大都不堪使用。陛下军中急需好手，只能留下一些老弱病残。其中一人在长城边的战斗中，脑袋被击中，成了瞎子，另外一人，战马倒地，压碎了他自己的腿，成了瘸子。他的卫队长被一个巨人用棍棒敲掉了一只胳膊…还有三人因强奸女野人被史坦尼斯下令给阉了。她还有两个酒鬼加一个胆小鬼。这个胆小鬼，国王自己也承认本该绞死他，可他出身贵族，他的父兄从一开始就坚定地忠于国王。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Having guards about her would no doubt help keep the black brothers properly respectful, the red priestess knew, but none of the men that Stannis had given her were like to be much help should she find herself in peril.

<div class="line_en">Devan fed fresh logs to the fire until the flames leapt up again, fierce and furious, driving the shadows back into the corners of the room, devouring all her unwanted dreams. The dark recedes again… for a little while. But beyond the Wall, the enemy grows stronger, and should he win the dawn will never come again. She wondered if it had been his face that she had seen, staring out at her from the flames. No. Surely not. His visage would be more frightening than that, cold and black and too terrible for any man to gaze upon and live.

<div class="line_en">It was Jon Snow she needed, not fried bread and bacon, but it was no use sending Devan to the lord commander. He would not come to her summons. Snow still chose to dwell behind the armory, in a pair of modest rooms previously occupied by the Watch's late blacksmith. Perhaps he did not think himself worthy of the King's Tower, or perhaps he did not care. That was his mistake, the false humility of youth that is itself a sort of pride. It was never wise for a ruler to eschew the trappings of power, for power itself flows in no small measure from such trappings.</div>

And while Melisandre had the knowledge to make more powders, she lacked many rare ingredients. My spells should suffice. She was stronger at the Wall, stronger even than in Asshai. Her every word and gesture was more potent, and she could do things that she had never done before.

The wildling sat on the edge of the window, slid his dagger from its sheath. "If some crow wants to slip a knife between my ribs whilst I'm spooning up some supper, he's welcome to try.

<div class="line_en">Melisandre took that as a sign and dismissed her own guard as well. They crossed the yard together, just the two of them. The snow fell all around them. She walked as close to Jon Snow as she dared, close enough to feel the mistrust pouring off him like a black fog. He does not love me, will never love me, but he will make use of me. Well and good. Melisandre had danced the same dance with Stannis Baratheon, back in the beginning. In truth, the young lord commander and her king had more in common than either one would ever be willing to admit. Stannis had been a younger son living in the shadow of his elder brother, just as Jon Snow, bastard-born, had always been eclipsed by his trueborn sibling, the fallen hero men had called the Young Wolf. Both men were unbelievers by nature, mistrustful, suspicious. The only gods they truly worshiped were honor and duty.</div>
