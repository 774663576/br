<div class="line_en">"My mother suffered a good deal from our reduced circumstances, and she often had harsh words for her husband, veiled and sly reproaches. The poor man then made a gesture which used to distress me. He would pass his open hand over his forehead, as if to wipe away perspiration which did not exist, and he would answer nothing. I felt his helpless suffering. We economized on everything, and never would accept an invitation to dinner, so as not to have to return the courtesy. All our provisions were bought at bargain sales. My sisters made their own gowns, and long discussions would arise on the price of a piece of braid worth fifteen centimes a yard. Our meals usually consisted of soup and beef, prepared with every kind of sauce.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我母亲因为我们生活得不宽裕很感痛苦，时常找着好些尖刻的话，好些遮遮掩掩的和不顾信义的闲话去对付我的父亲。这位可怜的丈夫当时有一个教我伤心的手势。他每每张开手掌搁在额头上，俨然是去擦汗一般，可是汗呢，并没有，而且他绝不答辩。我感到他的懦弱的痛苦了。大家尤其注意节约，从来不接受邀请去吃一顿夜饭，为的是免得回请；家里买的食品之类全是大减价的东西，种种陈货。姊姊们的裙袍全是自家缝的，为了三个铜元一公尺的滚条，也要在价格上商量好久。我们通常的食品仅仅是浓汤和牛肉杂烩。">查看中文翻译</div>

My father, in a frock coat, high hat and kid gloves, would offer his arm to my mother, decked out and beribboned like a ship on a holiday. My sisters, who were always ready first, would await the signal for leaving; but at the last minute some one always found a spot on my father's frock coat, and it had to be wiped away quickly with a rag moistened with benzine.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Then we set out ceremoniously. My sisters marched on ahead, arm in arm. They were of marriageable age and had to be displayed. I walked on the left of my mother and my father on her right. I remember the pompous air of my poor parents in these Sunday walks, their stern expression, their stiff walk. They moved slowly, with a serious expression, their bodies straight, their legs stiff, as if something of extreme importance depended upon their appearance.</div>
