<div class="line_en">It wasn't really the plan that he would be sitting outside this hospital again. He hates hospitals, after all, and now he's bloody been here three times in less than a week. It's not right and proper. But no other choice was available to him.</div>

<div class="line_en">It started with Ove and the cat, during their daily inspection, when they discovered that the sign forbidding vehicular traffic within the residential area had been run over. This inspired such colorful profanities from Ove that the cat looked quite embarrassed. Ove marched off in fury and emerged moments later with his snow shovel. Then he stopped, looking towards Anita and Rune's house, his jaws clamped so hard that they made a creaking sound. The cat looked at him accusingly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一大早欧维和猫就出门进行每日一次的小区巡逻，发现有人撞倒了“社区内禁止车辆通行”的标牌。欧维从指甲缝里刮掉白油漆，嘴里喷的脏话让猫咪都有些挂不住。在安妮塔和鲁尼的房子边，欧维发现了沿路的烟头。之后，欧维一肚子火，不得不额外又逛一圈，就为了冷静冷静。他回来的时候，猫坐在雪地里，哀怨地看着他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When the cat didn't seem to find this to be in any way an acceptable explanation, Ove pointed at it with the snow shovel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="猫看上去并不接受这样的解释，欧维举起铲子指着它。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The cat didn't answer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="猫没有回答。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You think this is the first time I've had a run-in with the council? That decision about Rune, do you think they've actually come to a real conclusion about it? They NEVER will! It'll go to appeal and then they'll drag it out and put it through their shitty bureaucratic grind! You understand? You think it'll happen quickly, but it takes months! Years! You think I'm going to stick around here just because that old sod went all helpless?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你以为这是我第一次跟政府打交道？你以为鲁尼的事儿就这么了结了？没完！还要申诉，再立案，讨论，权衡，一大堆官僚主义的狗屁事！你懂吗？你以为很快就能解决，其实得折腾几个月甚至几年！你以为，就因为那个老家伙成了窝囊废，我就会老老实实地守在这儿？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That is not the reason why Ove and the cat are sitting in the Saab in the parking area outside the hospital. But it does have a fairly direct connection with Ove standing there shoveling snow when that journalist woman in her slightly too large green jacket turned up outside his house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="好吧，实话说，虽然这真不是欧维和猫咪现在把萨博停在医院门口的原因，但至少直接关系到为什么那个穿大号绿色风衣的女记者出现在欧维家门口时，他会站在那儿铲雪。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你懂吗？你不懂！”欧维吆喝一声转过身。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Ask them somewhere else. I don't want them here," Ove answered, scattering snow about him in a way that made it difficult to tell whether he was shoveling or digging.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“到别处问去，这儿没你什么事。”欧维回答，继续朝四面八方扬着雪，那架势，很难说他是在铲还是在挖。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="猫不作评价。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When she carried on banging and shouting even louder, Ove didn't know what to do, so he threw the door open and put his finger over his mouth, hushing her, as if in the next moment he was going to point out that this was actually a library.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那个女记者一直敲着门，嗓门还越喊越大，欧维不知所措起来，于是他打开门，把食指放在嘴上嘘她，就好像紧接着就要提醒她这里是图书馆似的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But I only want t --" she said, but she was interrupted by Ove and the cat going into the house and slamming the door in her face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但我只是想……”她说，话音未落，欧维和猫咪就已经走进房子，把门甩在她脸上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ove and the cat squatted in the hall and waited for her to leave. But she didn't leave. She started banging on the door and calling out: "But you're a hero!!!"</div>

<div class="line_en">She attempted to grin up at his face, waving something that Ove instinctively perceived as a camera of some sort. Or something else. It wasn't so easy knowing what cameras looked like anymore in this bloody society.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她满脸堆笑地朝他挥舞着什么东西，欧维本能地以为是某种照相机，或者别的东西。如今这该死的社会，哪儿那么容易认清相机长啥样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So the cat and Ove stepped out the door, locked it, and headed off as quick as they could towards the parking area. The journalist woman jogged along behind them.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我什么都不要。”欧维说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She regained her balance and waved the camera at him, while yelling something. Ove wasn't listening. He looked at the camera as if it were a weapon, and then decided to flee. This person was clearly not a reasonable person.</div>

<div class="line_en">To be absolutely clear about it, though, no part of this bears any relation to why Ove is now sitting outside the hospital. But when Parvaneh stood knocking on the door of Ove's house, fifteen minutes or so later, holding her three-year-old by the hand, and when no one opened and then she heard voices from the parking area, this, so to speak, has a good deal to do with Ove sitting outside the hospital.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="好吧，说真的，这显然也不是欧维现在坐在医院门口的理由。但帕尔瓦娜一刻钟后牵着三岁女孩来敲欧维家的门却没人应答，与此同时，她听见从停车场传来说话声，这可跟欧维为什么坐在医院门口大有关系。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ove raised his big hand and pushed her back over the threshold as a reflex, so that she almost fell headfirst into the snow.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“这是威逼利诱。”他对帕尔瓦娜说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ove immediately took two steps away from it. At once, Parvaneh smiled confidently at him. As if she had just worked out the solution to a crossword.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维马上退开两步。帕尔瓦娜冲他得意地笑，就像刚解开了个字谜。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Or I'll tell the journalist that I can tell a story or two about you, Ove," she said, raising her eyebrows.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不然，我就跟这个记者说，我有一两个关于你的故事要讲。”她说着冲他扬了扬眉毛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ove looked up. He didn't look a bit convinced. Parvaneh threw out her arms.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维抬起头，完全不为所动。他真心不想再回那个医院。帕尔瓦娜摊开双手。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Hey, Ove! How about this: if you give us a lift to the hospital, I'll help you get rid of this journalist! Okay?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“听着，欧维！这样如何，你开车送我们去医院，我帮你处理这个记者！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She saw the way Ove's face twitched above his cheekbones when she said "bus."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她看到，听见她说“公车”，欧维的腮帮子尴尬地抽搐了一下。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In fact the only thing Parvaneh had done was to open the garage door, give that journalist her card, and say, "Call me and we'll talk about Ove." Was that really a way of getting rid of anyone? Ove doesn't think, properly speaking, that it's a way of getting rid of anyone at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但事实上，帕尔瓦娜打开车库门后，递给记者一张名片并告诉她：“给我打电话，我们聊聊欧维的事。”这算是哪门子处理？说实话，欧维觉得这样处理不了任何事情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The cat seemed not to know what this meant. But if the clown had been anywhere near as tiresome as this three-year-old, the cat didn't take an entirely negative view of Ove hitting someone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="猫咪看上去好像不太明白她的意思。但假设那个小丑跟这个三岁女孩一样招人烦，猫咪倒并不觉得欧维打人这事儿有什么负面影响。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Ove ackatted de clauwn!" said the three-year-old and nodded in an initiated way at the cat, clearly because she felt that Ove's aversion to the hospital needed further explanation to whoever was not there the last time they went.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“欧维打了小糗！”三岁女孩边说边冲着猫咪点头，她显然认为，对上次不在场的所有人，大概都要进一步解释下欧维对医院的抵触情绪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And so this is the reason why Ove is sitting here now. The cat looks personally let down by Ove for making it travel all the way in the backseat with the three-year-old. Ove adjusts the newspapers on the seats. He feels he's been tricked. When Parvaneh said she'd "get rid of" the journalist, he didn't have a very clear idea of exactly how she'd manage it. Obviously he didn't have expectations of the woman being conjured away in a puff of smoke or knocked out with a spade or buried in the desert or anything of that kind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因此欧维现在坐在了医院门外。猫的表情像在控诉欧维背信弃义，因为他居然让它一路都跟三岁女孩一起坐在后座上。欧维调整了座位上的报纸。他觉得自己被耍了。帕尔瓦娜说她会“处理”那个记者的时候，他大概没想明白自己究竟指望一个怎样的具体结果。当然，他也不会要求帕尔瓦娜把她变成一团云雾，或者一铲子把她抡倒，再驮到沙漠里埋了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"They won't be coming to take Rune away. They say they're going to do it, but they'll be busy with the process for many years," says Ove to the cat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他们不会来接鲁尼的。他们说会来，但办理的过程起码得花上几年。”欧维对猫说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But now it's too late, of course. Now, damn it, he's sitting here waiting outside the hospital for the third time in less than a week. Blackmail, that's what it is.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但为时已晚。他现在还是等在了医院门口，一周之内第三次，真要命。这不是威逼利诱，是什么？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Added to this, Ove has the cat's resentful stares to contend with. Something in its eyes reminds him of the way Sonja used to look at him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="另外，还有这只猫在欧维身边送上埋怨的眼神。这眼神中，总有些东西让欧维不由地想起索雅曾经看着他的样子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Maybe he's also saying it to Sonja. And maybe to himself. He doesn't know.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="或许他是在对索雅说，或许是对他自己，他也不知道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"At least stop feeling so sorry for yourself. If it wasn't for me you'd be living with the kid, and then you wouldn't have much left of what you have now for a tail. Think about that!" He snorts at the cat, in an attempt to change the subject.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“至少你别再这么顾影自怜了。要不是我，你就去和那个小伙子住一块儿了，这样的话，你仅有的那截尾巴也剩不了多少了。想想吧你！”他厉声教训猫，试着转移话题。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He's not some bloody senile old man.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他可他妈不是什么老年人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The cat rolls onto its side, away from Ove, and goes to sleep in protest. Ove looks out the window again. He knows very well that the three-year-old isn't allergic at all. He knows very well that Parvaneh just lied to him so she wouldn't have to take care of the Cat Annoyance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="猫翻了个身，背对欧维，以睡觉表示抗议。欧维又朝窗外张望了一下。他很清楚那个三岁女孩根本不过敏。他知道这是帕尔瓦娜编出来的，好让他收留这只猫崽子。">查看中文翻译</div>
