Mr. Weston would take no denial; they must all dine at Randalls one day; -- even Mr. Woodhouse was persuaded to think it a possible thing in preference to a division of the party.</div>

<div class="line_en">Emma sat with her as long as she could, to attend her in Mrs. Goddard's unavoidable absences, and raise her spirits by representing how much Mr. Elton's would be depressed when he knew her state; and left her at last tolerably comfortable, in the sweet dependence of his having a most comfortless visit, and of their all missing her very much. She had not advanced many yards from Mrs. Goddard's door, when she was met by Mr. Elton himself, evidently coming towards it, and as they walked on slowly together in conversation about the invalid -- of whom he, on the rumour of considerable illness, had been going to inquire, that he might carry some report of her to Hartfield -- they were overtaken by Mr. John Knightley returning from the daily visit to Donwell, with his two eldest boys, whose healthy, glowing faces shewed all the benefit of a country run, and seemed to ensure a quick despatch of the roast mutton and rice pudding they were hastening home for. They joined company and proceeded together. Emma was just describing the nature of her friend's complaint; -- `a throat very much inflamed, with a great deal of heat about her, a quick, low pulse, &amp;c. and she was sorry to find from Mrs. Goddard that Harriet was liable to very bad sore-throats, and had often alarmed her with them.' Mr. Elton looked all alarm on the occasion, as he exclaimed,</div>

<div class="line_en">The evening before this great event (for it was a very great event that Mr. Woodhouse should dine out, on the 24th of December) had been spent by Harriet at Hartfield, and she had gone home so much indisposed with a cold, that, but for her own earnest wish of being nursed by Mrs. Goddard, Emma could not have allowed her to leave the house. Emma called on her the next day, and found her doom already signed with regard to Randalls. She was very feverish and had a bad sore throat: Mrs. Goddard was full of care and affection, Mr. Perry was talked of, and Harriet herself was too ill and low to resist the authority which excluded her from this delightful engagement, though she could not speak of her loss without many tears.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伍德豪斯先生竟然在十二月二十四日出门做客，这真是件了不起的大事。就在这件大事发生的前夜，哈丽特待在哈特菲尔德，不想得了重感冒，爱玛本不肯放她走，可她执意要让戈达德太太照料她，便回家去了。第二天，爱玛去看望她，发现她肯定去不了兰多尔斯。她发着高烧，喉咙痛得厉害。戈达德太太疼爱不已，放心不下，说要去请佩里先生。哈丽特自觉病得浑身无力，也就认定无法去参加这次愉快的聚会，不过说起错失了良机，倒也流了不少泪。">查看中文翻译</div>

But, upon my word, Mr. Elton, in your case, I should certainly excuse myself.

<div class="line_cn" title="埃尔顿先生看样子不知如何回答，实际上也确实如此。虽说他为自己受到这样一位美貌小姐的关心而感到喜不自禁，而且也不想不听她的劝诫，但他丝毫也不愿意放弃这次做客的机会。谁想爱玛心里着急，光顾着琢磨她早已想好的主意和念头，既没听明白他的话，也没看清楚他的神情，只听他喃喃地承认天是“很冷，的确很冷”，便感觉很得意，只管继续往前走，一想到这一来埃尔顿先生可以不去兰多尔斯，并能在晚上打发人每个钟头去探望一次哈丽特，心里不禁喜滋滋的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">`Well,' said she to herself, `this is most strange! -- After I had got him off so well, to chuse to go into company, and leave Harriet ill behind! -- Most strange indeed! -- But there is, I believe, in many men, especially single men, such an inclination -- such a passion for dining out -- a dinner engagement is so high in the class of their pleasures, their employments, their dignities, almost their duties, that any thing gives way to it -- and this must be the case with Mr. Elton; a most valuable, amiable, pleasing young man undoubtedly, and very much in love with Harriet; but still, he cannot refuse an invitation, he must dine out wherever he is asked.

<div class="line_en">Mr. Woodhouse had so completely made up his mind to the visit, that in spite of the increasing coldness, he seemed to have no idea of shrinking from it, and set forward at last most punctually with his eldest daughter in his own carriage, with less apparent consciousness of the weather than either of the others; too full of the wonder of his own going, and the pleasure it was to afford at Randalls to see that it was cold, and too well wrapt up to feel it. The cold, however, was severe; and by the time the second carriage was in motion, a few flakes of snow were finding their way down, and the sky had the appearance of being so overcharged as to want only a milder air to produce a very white world in a very short time.</div>

Going in dismal weather, to return probably in worse; -- four horses and four servants taken out for nothing but to convey five idle, shivering creatures into colder rooms and worse company than they might have had at home.'</div>

<div class="line_en">Emma smiled and answered -- `My visit was of use to the nervous part of her complaint, I hope; but not even I can charm away a sore throat; it is a most severe cold indeed. Mr. Perry has been with her, as you probably heard.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱玛微微一笑，答道：“我去看望她，我想是会给她带来点精神安慰的，可是就连我也治不好她的咽喉痛。她的感冒还真是非常严重。佩里先生一直在守着她，你大概也听说了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">`He has been used to her in these complaints, and I hope to-morrow morning will bring us both a more comfortable report. But it is impossible not to feel uneasiness. Such a sad loss to our party to-day!'</div>

<div class="line_en">`Oh! no -- I am grieved to find -- I was on the point of telling you that when I called at Mrs. Goddard's door, which I did the very last thing before I returned to dress, I was told that Miss Smith was not better, by no means better, rather worse. Very much grieved and concerned -- I had flattered myself that she must be better after such a cordial as I knew had been given her in the morning.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦！是没好转——让我感到难过的是——我正想告诉你，就在我回去换衣服之前，我去了戈达德太太家，听说哈丽特小姐没有好转，一点也不见好转，反而病得更重了。我感到很难过，也很担忧——但我知道她早上吃了点提神的甜酒，还以为她该好些了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This was very proper; the sigh which accompanied it was really estimable; but it should have lasted longer. Emma was rather in dismay when only half a minute afterwards he began to speak of other things, and in a voice of the greatest alacrity and enjoyment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这话说得倒很妥当，接着又是一声叹息，真是难能可贵。不过，他的叹息应该拉长一点。不一会工夫，他就说起了别的事情，而且是带着兴高采烈的口气，让爱玛心里凉了半截。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">`What an excellent device,' said he, `the use of a sheepskin for carriages. How very comfortable they make it; -- impossible to feel cold with such precautions. The contrivances of modern days indeed have rendered a gentleman's carriage perfectly complete. One is so fenced and guarded from the weather, that not a breath of air can find its way unpermitted. Weather becomes absolutely of no consequence. It is a very cold afternoon -- but in this carriage we know nothing of the matter. -- Ha! snows a little I see.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“用羊皮把马车裹起来，”埃尔顿先生说道，“真是个好主意。这样一来就舒服多了。采取了这样的措施，就不会觉得冷了。绅士的马车配上现代的装置，还真变得完美无缺了。人坐在里面给封得严严实实的，不怕日晒雨淋，连一丝风也透不进来。天气好坏已经完全无关紧要。今天下午天气很冷——可是我们坐在这辆马车里，却一点也不觉得冷。哈！我察觉下小雪了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">`Christmas weather,' observed Mr. Elton. `Quite seasonable; and extremely fortunate we may think ourselves that it did not begin yesterday, and prevent this day's party, which it might very possibly have done, for Mr. Woodhouse would hardly have ventured had there been much snow on the ground; but now it is of no consequence. This is quite the season indeed for friendly meetings. At Christmas every body invites their friends about them, and people think little of even the worst weather. I was snowed up at a friend's house once for a week. Nothing could be pleasanter. I went for only one night, and could not get away till that very day se'nnight.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“圣诞节的天气嘛，”埃尔顿先生说。“倒是挺适时的。我们可谓幸运极了，昨天没有开始下雪，不然我们今天兴许还聚不到一起呢：如果地上积了厚厚一层雪，伍德豪斯先生是不大敢出门的。不过现在没有关系了。这是朋友们相会的时节。到了圣诞节，人人都把朋友请到家里，天气再坏也不在乎。有一次我让大雪困住了，在一位朋友家住了一个星期。真是快活极了。我原来打算只住一夜，后来走不了了，住了整整一个星期。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At another time Emma might have been amused, but she was too much astonished now at Mr. Elton's spirits for other feelings. Harriet seemed quite forgotten in the expectation of a pleasant party.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="若是换个时候，爱玛也许会给逗乐了，可是现在她感到大为惊讶，埃尔顿先生居然会有兴致去想别的心事。他一心只想大家凑在一起乐一乐，哈丽特似乎早被抛到了九霄云外。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mr. John Knightley looked as if he did not comprehend the pleasure, but said only, coolly,</div>

<div class="line_en">`We are sure of excellent fires,' continued he, `and every thing in the greatest comfort. Charming people, Mr. and Mrs. Weston; -- Mrs. Weston indeed is much beyond praise, and he is exactly what one values, so hospitable, and so fond of society; -- it will be a small party, but where small parties are select, they are perhaps the most agreeable of any. Mr. Weston's dining-room does not accommodate more than ten comfortably; and for my part, I would rather, under such circumstances, fall short by two than exceed by two. I think you will agree with me, (turning with a soft air to Emma,) I think I shall certainly have your approbation, though Mr. Knightley perhaps, from being used to the large parties of London, may not quite enter into our feelings.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们肯定可以享受到暖烘烘的火炉，”他接着说道，“一切都安排得十分舒适。韦斯顿夫妇是很可爱的人。韦斯顿太太真是任你怎么夸奖都不过分，韦斯顿先生正是受人器重的那种人，热情好客，喜欢交际。今天是个小型聚会，不过，如果到会的都是些谈得来的人，这小型聚会还兴许更有意思。韦斯顿先生的餐厅坐十个人倒还凑合，再多就不舒服了。要是换成我，在这种情况下，我宁可少两个人，也不要多两个人。我想你会同意我的看法。”说着满面柔情地转向爱玛。“我想你一定会赞同我的观点，不过奈特利先生可能比较习惯于伦敦的大型聚会，不大会赞成我们的看法。”">查看中文翻译</div>
