A watch in his pyjama pocket was found to be badly dented and it had stopped at a quarter past one. Dr. Constantine, who examined the body when found, puts the time of death as having occurred between midnight and two in the morning.

<div class="line_en">"Now I put it to you, ladies and gentlemen, that Mr. Ratchett knew a good deal more than he told. The enemy as Mr. Ratchett expected, joined the train at Belgrade, or possibly at Vincouci, by the door left open by Colonel Arbuthnot and Mr. MacQueen who had just descended to the platform. He was provided with a suit of Wagon Lit uniform, which he wore over his ordinary clothes, and a pass key which enabled him to gain access to Mr. Ratchett's compartment in spite of the door being locked. Mr. Ratchett was under the influence of a sleeping draught. This man stabbed him with great ferocity and left the compartment through the communicating door leading to Mrs. Hubbard's compartment --"</div>

<div class="line_en">"But I will put before you an alternative theory. It is very simple. Mr. Ratchett had a certain enemy whom he feared.

<div class="line_en">"There you have the explanation of the whole thing. Mr. Ratchett had ommitted to put his watch back an hour as he should have done at Tzaribrod. His watch still registered Eastern European time, which is one hour ahead of Central European time. It was a quarter past twelve when Mr. Ratchett was stabbed -- not a quarter past one."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我会把整件事情解释清楚的。在查理布罗德的时候，雷切特先生忘了要把表调慢一小时。他的表仍然是东欧时间，比中欧时间快了一小时。所以雷切特先生被刺死的时间是十二点一刻，而不是一点一刻。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Then he slipped out of the compartment and along the corridor. He hastily thrust the uniform into a suitcase in an empty compartment, and a few minutes later, dressed in ordinary clothes, he left the train just before it started off. Again using the same means of egress -- the door near the dining car."</div>

<div class="line_en">"I agreed with him, but when this particular point came into my mind, I tried to imagine whether such an assembly were ever likely to be collected under any other conditions. And the answer I made to myself was -- only in America. In America there might be a household composed of just such varied nationalities -- an Italian chauffeur, and English governess, a Swedish nurse, a French lady's maid and so on. That led me to my scheme of 'guessing'-- that is, casting each person for a certain part in the Armstrong drama much as a producer casts a play. Well, that gave me an extremely interesting and satisfactory result.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我同意他的说法，但想到这个特点时，我试着想象这样一群人在其他条件下是否有可能聚在一起。我的答案是——只有在美国。在美国，可能有这么一个家庭，包括了这么多不同国家的人——一个意大利汽车司机，一个英国家庭女教师，一个瑞典护士，还有一个德国女仆，诸如此类。这让我产生了一个猜测的框架——就是说，像导演选角色那样，给每个人分配一个在阿姆斯特朗家中出现的角色。这不仅十分有趣，而且让我得到了一个满意的结果。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I had also examined in my own mind each separate person's evidence with some curious results. Take first the evidence of Mr. MacQueen.

<div class="line_en">"Then the valet. He said his master was in the habit of taking a sleeping draught when travelling by train. That might be true, but would Ratchett have taken one last night? The automatic under his pillow gave the lie to that statement. Ratchett intended to be on the alert last night. Whatever narcotic was administered to him must have been done so without his knowledge. By whom? Obviously by MacQueen or the valet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“然后是男仆。他说他的主人坐火车时习惯服用一片安眠药。这可能是真的，但是雷切特昨晚吃安眠药了没有？他枕头下面的自动手枪证明仆人说了谎。既然雷切特打算昨晚加强防备，那么不管他昨晚服用了什么安眠药，他自己肯定是不知情的。谁给他服的呢？显然是麦奎因或者他的仆人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Now I could feel that that was not what he had started out to say. Supposing what he had meant to say was, 'But surely that was burnt!'

<div class="line_cn" title="“因此我感觉到这不是他开始想说的话。假设他原本打算说的是：‘可是，肯定已经烧了。’在这种情况下，说明麦奎因先生知道这封信，并且知道它已经被烧毁了。换句话说，他要么是凶手，要么就是凶手的同伙。很好。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Now we come to the evidence of Mr. Hardman. I believed all that he told me about his own identity, but when it came to the actual methods he had employed to guard Mr. Ratchett, his story was neither more nor less than absurd. The only way effectively to have protected Ratchett was to have passed the night actually in his compartment or in some spot where he could watch the door. The only thing that his evidence did show plainly was that no one in any other part of the train could possibly have murdered Ratchett. It drew a clear circle round the Stamboul-Calais carriage. That seemed to me a rather curious and inexplicable fact, and I put it aside to think over.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“现在，我们看看哈德曼先生的证词。我相信他对我说的关于自己身份的情况，但是当他说起自己用来保护雷切特先生的实际方法时，他的说法多少有点荒谬。保护雷切特唯一行之有效的办法就是和他一起在房间里过夜，或者在某个能观察到他房门的地方。他的证词中说得很明白的一件事就是，其他车厢里的人不可能谋杀雷切特。这就把范围明确缩小到了伊斯坦布尔－加来车厢之中。我觉得这一点非常古怪，令人费解，我先把它放在一边。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You probably have all heard by now of the few words I overheard between Miss Debenham and Colonel Arbuthnot. The interesting thing to my mind was the fact that Colonel Arbuthnot called her Mary and was clearly on terms of intimacy with her. But the Colonel was only supposed to have met her a few days previously -- and I know Englishmen of the Colonel's type. Even if he had fallen in love with the young lady at first sight, he would have advanced slowly and with decorum -- not rushing things. Therefore I concluded that Colonel Arbuthnot and Miss Debenham were in reality well acquainted, and were for some reason pretending to be strangers. Another small point was Miss Debenham's easy familiarity with the term 'long distance' for a telephone call. Yet Miss Debenham had told me that she had never been in the States.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我无意中听到的德贝纳姆小姐和阿巴思诺特上校说的那几句话，也许此刻你们大家都已经知道了。在我看来，一个有趣的事实就是，阿巴思诺特上校叫她‘玛丽’，显然他们关系很亲近。但是阿巴思诺特上校应该是几天前才遇见她的。而且我了解上校这一类英国人——就算对她一见钟情，也会很礼貌地慢慢进展，绝不会仓促行事。因此我推断，阿巴思诺特上校和德贝纳姆小姐其实早已认识，出于某个原因才假装互不相识。还有个小问题就是，德贝纳姆小姐熟悉‘长途电话’这个词，然而她却告诉我她从未去过美国。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"To pass to another witness. Mrs. Hubbard had told us that lying in bed she was unable to see whether the communicating door was bolted or not, and so asked Miss Ohlsson to see for her. Now, though her statement would have been perfectly true if she had been occupying compartments Nos. 2, 4, 12, or any even number -- where the bolt is directly under the handle of the door -- in the uneven numbers, such as compartment No. 3, the bolt is well above the handle and could not therefore be masked by the sponge bag in the least.

<div class="line_en">"And here let me say just a word or two about times. To my mind, the really interesting point about the dented watch was the place where it was found -- in Ratchett's pyjama pocket, a singularly uncomfortable and unlikely place to keep one's watch, especially as there is a watch 'hook' provided just by the head of the bed. I felt sure, therefore, that the watch had been deliberately placed in the pocket and faked. The crime, then, was not committed at a quarter past one.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“在这里，我说几句关于时间的问题。在我看来，那块瘪了的手表，真正有趣之处在于它所在的地方——在雷切特的睡衣口袋里，一个非常不舒服、非常不适合放表的地方。况且，床头边上还有一个挂表的‘挂钩’。因此我确信那块表是故意被放进口袋里的——伪装。那么，凶案就不是发生在一点一刻了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Was it, then, committed earlier? To be exact, at twenty-three minutes to one? My friend M. Bouc advanced as an argument in favour of it the loud cry which awoke me from sleep.

Every minute detail of their evidence was worked out beforehand.

The only additional thing to be done was to confuse the issue even further. Two so-called 'clues' were dropped in the dead man's compartment -- one incriminating Colonel Arbuthnot (who had the strongest alibi and whose connection with the Armstrong family was probably the hardest to prove) and the second clue, the handkerchief, incriminating Princess Dragomiroff, who by virtue of her social position, her particularly frail physique and the alibi given her by her maid and the conductor, was practically in an unassailable position.</div>

A judicious selection of people -- the conductor, Miss Debenham and MacQueen -- will also have seen her. It was, I think, someone with a sense of humour who thoughtfully placed the scarlet kimono on the top of my suitcase whilst I was interviewing people in the dining car.

But that seemed very improbable. Then I remembered that the dead nurserymaid was French. Supposing that that unfortunate girl had been Pierre Michel's daughter. That would explain everything -- it would also explain the place chosen for the staging of the crime. Were there any others whose part in the drama was not clear? Colonel Arbuthnot I put down as a friend of the Armstrongs. They had probably been through the war together. The maid, Hildegarde Schmidt, I could guess her place in the Armstrong household. I am, perhaps, overgreedy, but I sense a good cook instinctively. I laid a trap for her -- she fell into it. I said I knew she was a good cook.

With Pierre Michel actually working on that train, the chance was too good to be missed. Besides, it would be a good way of not incriminating any outsiders.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“完善整个计划花费了很长时间。我们首先得了解雷切特的行踪，最后哈德曼做到了。接着我们想方设法让他雇用马斯特曼和赫克托——或者至少是其中一个。嗯，我们做到了。然后我们跟苏珊娜的父亲商量了一下。阿巴思诺特上校很支持十二个人合作，他想把事情做得更加合乎规则。他不喜欢用刀刺这个主意，但他同意这么做能省掉大部分麻烦。而且，苏珊娜的父亲也表示愿意。苏珊娜是他唯一的孩子。我们从赫克托那里得知，雷切特早晚要乘坐东方快车从东边回来。因为皮埃尔·米歇尔就在那趟车上工作，真是时不可失。而且，这也是个不牵连外人的好方法。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well," she said. "You know everything now, M. Poirot. What are you going to do about it? If it must all come out, can't you lay the blame upon me and me only? I would have stabbed that man twelve times willingly. It wasn't only that he was responsible for my daughter's death and her child's, and that of the other child who might have been alive and happy now. It was more than that. There had been other children before Daisy -- there might be others in the future. Society had condemned him; we were only carrying out the sentence. But it's unnecessary to bring all these others into it. All these good faithful souls -- and poor Michel -- and Mary and Colonel Arbuthnot -- they love each other…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好啦，”她说，“现在你全都知道了，波洛先生，你打算怎么办？如果必须把事情公之于众，你能不能把责任都推给我，让我独自承担呢？我情愿自己刺了那人十二刀，这不仅仅是因为他要对我女儿还有她孩子的死负责，还要对另一个原本可以幸福快乐生活的孩子负责。不仅如此，在黛西之前，还有别的孩子被绑架过，而且将来还可能会有其他人。社会给他定了罪，我们只是执行判决。但是没必要把其他人也牵扯进来。所有这些善良忠诚的人——还有可怜的米歇尔，还有玛丽和阿巴思诺特上校——他们都深爱彼此…”">查看中文翻译</div>
