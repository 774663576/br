<div class="line_en">The remorse that gripped her was powerful and sudden, a deep sadness laced with guilt. The man had reached out to her so many times over the past ten years, and yet Sophie had remained immovable -- leaving his letters and packages unopened in a bottom drawer and denying his efforts to see her. He lied to me! Kept appalling secrets! What was I supposed to do? And so she had blocked him out. Completely. Now her grandfather was dead, and he was talking to her from the grave. The Mona Lisa.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sophie arrived breathless outside the large wooden doors of the Salle des Etats -- the room that housed the Mona Lisa. Before entering, she gazed reluctantly farther down the hall, twenty yards or so, to the spot where her grandfather's body still lay under the spotlight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="索菲气喘吁吁地来到国家展厅的那扇大木门外———这就是收藏《蒙娜丽莎》的地方。她忍不住向大厅方向望去，在大约二十码远的地方，祖父的尸体静静地躺在聚光灯下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She reached for the huge wooden doors, and pushed. The entryway yawned open. Sophie stood on the threshold a moment, scanning the large rectangular chamber beyond. It too was bathed in a soft red light. The Salle des Etats was one of this museum's rare culs-de-sac -- a dead end and the only room off the middle of the Grand Gallery. This door, the chamber's sole point of entry, faced a dominating fifteen-foot Botticelli on the far wall. Beneath it, centered on the parquet floor, an immense octagonal viewing divan served as a welcome respite for thousands of visitors to rest their legs while they admired the Louvre's most valuable asset.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="索菲伸手推开那扇巨大木门，入口展现在她的眼前。她在门口站了片刻，扫视了一下眼前这个长方形的展厅。整个展厅沐浴在柔和的红色灯光下。国家展厅只有一个出入口，这样的结构在博物馆中很少见，而且它也是唯一在艺术大画廊中单独辟出的展厅。木门是进入这个展厅的唯一入口，它对着远处墙上那幅高达十五米的波提切利的名画。在那下面，拼花地板上放着一个巨大的八边形沙发，供成千上万的游客在欣赏卢浮宫的镇馆之宝前小憩片刻。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Even before Sophie entered, though, she knew she was missing something. A black light. She gazed down the hall at her grandfather under the lights in the distance, surrounded by electronic gear. If he had written anything in here, he almost certainly would have written it with the watermark stylus. Taking a deep breath, Sophie hurried down to the well-lit crime scene. Unable to look at her grandfather, she focused solely on the PTS tools. Finding a small ultraviolet penlight, she slipped it in the pocket of her sweater and hurried back up the hallway toward the open doors of the Salle des Etats.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="索菲还没进入展厅，就想起她忘了带一样东西， 黑光灯。她朝远处祖父的尸体望去，那尸体周围放置着电器装置。 如果祖父在展厅里写了些什么，那么他一定是用水笔写的。索菲深吸了一口气，急匆匆走到被灯光照得通亮的谋杀现场。她不忍将目光投向祖父，强迫自己将注意力集中在寻找PTS 工具上。她找到一支小巧的紫外线笔，将它放入毛衣口袋中，又匆忙沿着画廊向国家展厅那敞开的大门走去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sophie turned the corner and stepped over the threshold. Her entrance, however, was met by an unexpected sound of muffled footsteps racing toward her from inside the chamber. There's someone in here! A ghostly figure emerged suddenly from out of the reddish haze. Sophie jumped back. "There you are!" Langdon's hoarse whisper cut the air as his silhouette slid to a stop in front of her. Her relief was only momentary. "Robert, I told you to get out of here! If Fache --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="索菲刚转身跨过门槛，就意外地听见展厅中有低沉的脚步声，那脚步声正离她越来越近。里面有人！在如雾一般的红色灯光中忽然出现一个鬼影。索菲吓得倒退几步。“你来了！”兰登嘶哑的声音打破了恐怖的气氛，他那黑色的身影滑到索菲跟前，停了下来。索菲松了口气，又担心起来：“罗伯特，我让你离开这里！如果法希——”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The question startled her. How would Robert know that? Sophie had indeed seen the initials P. S. once before, in a kind of monogram. It was the day before her ninth birthday. She was secretly combing the house, searching for hidden birthday presents. Even then, she could not bear secrets kept from her. What did Grand-père get for me this year? She dug through cupboards and drawers. Did he get me the doll I wanted? Where would he hide it? Finding nothing in the entire house, Sophie mustered the courage to sneak into her grandfather's bed-room. The room was off-limits to her, but her grandfather was downstairs asleep on the couch.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个问题，让索菲颇感震惊。兰登怎么会知道？索菲确实曾经见过首字母缩写P。S。被用作花押字。那是在她九岁生日前一天，她悄悄在家四处寻找被藏起来的生日礼物。祖父，今年会送给我什么呢？她翻腾着壁橱和抽屉。他会送我想要的娃娃吗？他把它藏哪儿了？在翻遍了整座房子却一无所获之后，索菲鼓足勇气溜进祖父的房间。这间房本来是不允许进入的，但当时祖父在楼下的长沙发上睡着了，不会知道索菲的所作所为。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I'll just take a fast peek! Tiptoeing across the creaky wood floor to his closet, Sophie peered on the shelves behind his clothing. Nothing. Next she looked under the bed. Still nothing. Moving to his bureau, she opened the drawers and one by one began pawing carefully through them. There must be something for me here! As she reached the bottom drawer, she still had not found any hint of a doll. Dejected, she opened the final drawer and pulled aside some black clothes she had never seen him wear. She was about to close the drawer when her eyes caught a glint of gold in the back of the drawer. It looked like a pocket watch chain, but she knew he didn't wear one. Her heart raced as she realized what it must be.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我就迅速地偷看一下！索菲踮着脚向壁橱走去，地板在她脚下嘎嘎作响。她看了看被祖父的衣物挡住的搁板，却什么也没有发现。索菲又走向祖父的书桌，将抽屉一一打开，仔细翻看。这里一定有为我而藏的东西！可她一直没有看到玩具娃娃的影子。她沮丧地打开最后一个抽屉，翻动着一些祖父从来没有穿过的黑衣服。正当她要关上抽屉的时候，她看见在抽屉的深处有一样闪闪发光的东西。这东西看上去像一根怀表链，但她知道祖父从不带怀表。当她猜想到这是什么的时候，她的心狂跳了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A necklace! Sophie carefully pulled the chain from the drawer. To her surprise, on the end was a brilliant gold key. Heavy and shimmering. Spellbound, she held it up. It looked like no key she had ever seen. Most keys were flat with jagged teeth, but this one had a triangular column with little pockmarks all over it. Its large golden head was in the shape of a cross, but not a normal cross. This was an even-armed one, like a plus sign. Embossed in the middle of the cross was a strange symbol -- two letters intertwined with some kind of flowery design.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一条项链！ 索菲小心翼翼地从抽屉中把这条链子取出，并惊奇地发现链子末端还挂坠着一把金钥匙。金钥匙沉甸甸的，闪闪发光。索菲恍恍忽忽地握住这把与众不同的钥匙。大多数钥匙都是扁平的，钥匙边参差不齐，但这把钥匙却呈三棱柱形，上面布满小孔。金色的大钥匙柄呈十字形，但交叉的两条线段一样长，像一个加号。在十字的中心镶嵌着一个奇特的标志——两个相互交织在一起的字母和一朵花的图案。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Her grandfather walked in. "Sophie, you need to respect other people's privacy." Gently, he knelt down and took the key from her. "This key is very special. If you had lost it…" Her grandfather's quiet voice made Sophie feel even worse. "I'm sorry, Grand-père. I really am." She paused. "I thought it was a neck-lace for my birthday." He gazed at her for several seconds. "I'll say this once more, Sophie, because it's important. You need to learn to respect other people 's privacy."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="祖父走进来。“索菲，你应该尊重别人隐私。”祖父蹲下身，轻轻拿起钥匙。“这把钥匙很特别，要是你把它弄丢了…”祖父轻柔的声音让索菲觉得更加难受。“对不起，祖父。我真的…以为这是一条项链，是我的生日礼物。”祖父凝视着索菲。“我再说一遍，索菲。它非常重要。你应该学会尊重别人隐私。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"P. S.," she whispered, scowling as she read the letters. Whatever could this be? "Sophie?" her grandfather spoke from the doorway. Startled, she spun, dropping the key on the floor with a loud clang. She stared down at the key, afraid to look up at her grandfather's face. "I… was looking for my birthday present," she said, hanging her head, knowing she had betrayed his trust. For what seemed like an eternity, her grandfather stood silently in the doorway. Finally, he let out a long troubled breath. "Pick up the key, Sophie." Sophie retrieved the key.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“PS，”索菲皱着眉头轻声念道。这到底是什么呢？“索菲？”祖父的声音从门口传来。索菲吓得一愣，钥匙“当”的一声掉落在地。她盯着地板上的钥匙，不敢抬头看祖父。“我……在找我的生日礼物。”索菲低着头说，她知道自己辜负了祖父的信任。祖父在门口站了良久，一言不发。 最后，他终于不安地叹了口气，说：“索菲，把钥匙捡起来。”索菲捡起钥匙。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A treasure hunt! Eagerly, she pored over the riddle until she solved it. The solution pointed her to another part of the house, where she found another card and another riddle. She solved this one too, racing on to the next card. Running wildly, she darted back and forth across the house, from clue to clue, until at last she found a clue that directed her back to her own bedroom. Sophie dashed up the stairs, rushed into her room, and stopped in her tracks. There in the middle of the room sat a shining red bicycle with a ribbon tied to the handlebars. Sophie shrieked with delight. "I know you asked for a doll," her grandfather said, smiling in the corner. "I thought you might like this even better."</div>

<div class="line_en">"How do you know this?" Sophie was praying Langdon was not going to tell her that he himself was a member.

<div class="line_en">"Da Vinci presided over the Priory between 1510 and 1519 as the brotherhood's Grand Master, which might help explain your grandfather's passion for Leo-nardo's work. The two men share a historical fraternal bond. And it all fits perfectly with their fascination for goddess iconology, paganism, feminine deities, and contempt for the Church. The Priory has a well-documented history of reverence for the sacred feminine."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“从1510 年到1519 年，达·芬奇担任大主教主持隐修会的工作。这也正是你祖父酷爱列昂纳多的作品的原因。他们虽然身处不同的历史时期，但都是教会的兄弟。他们都酷爱女神圣像学，信仰异教、女神，蔑视天主教。对于隐修会信奉神圣的女神，有详细的历史记载。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Despite the total conviction in Langdon's eyes, Sophie's gut reaction was one of stark disbelief. A secret pagan cult? Once headed by Leonardo da Vinci? It all sounded utterly absurd. And yet, even as she dismissed it, she felt her mind reeling back ten years -- to the night she had mistakenly surprised her grandfather and witnessed what she still could not accept. Could that explain --?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然兰登的眼神无比坚定，但索菲打心眼儿里怀疑这种说法。一个秘密的异教狂热崇拜者组织？曾以达·芬奇为首？这听起来十分荒唐。她情不自禁地回想起十年前的那个夜晚———她无意的早归让祖父惊讶万分，她看到了那令她至今无法接受的事实。难道这就是为什么……？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"More like the pagan goddess worship cult. But more important, they are known as the guardians of an ancient secret. One that made them immeasurably powerful."</div>

<div class="line_en">"The identities of living Priory members are kept extremely secret," Lang-don said, "but the P. S. and fleur-de-lis that you saw as a child are proof. It could only have been related to the Priory." Sophie realized now that Langdon knew far more about her grandfather than she had previously imagined. This American obviously had volumes to share with her, but this was not the place. "I can't afford to let them catch you, Robert. There's a lot we need to discuss. You need to go!" Langdon heard only the faint murmur of her voice. He wasn't going anywhere. He was lost in another place now. A place where ancient secrets rose to the surface. A place where forgotten histories emerged from the shadows.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“还活着的成员的身份是机密。”兰登说。“但你小时候所见到的PS。和法国百合图案是一个有力的证明。它只可能与隐修会有关。”索菲这才意识到兰登对她祖父的了解超乎她的想象。 这个美国人可以告诉她许多东西，但这里显然不是说话的地方。“我可不能让他们把你抓走，罗伯特。我们还有很多东西要谈。你必须离开这里！”索菲的声音在兰登的脑海中变得模糊。他哪儿也不想去。他又陷入了沉思。 古老的秘密浮现在他的眼前，那些被人遗忘的历史又呈现在他的脑海中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A few miles away, on the riverbank beyond Les Invalides, the bewildered driver of a twin-bed Trailor truck stood at gunpoint and watched as the captain of the Judicial Police let out a guttural roar of rage and heaved a bar of soap out into the turgid waters of the Seine.</div>

<div class="line_en">Slowly, as if moving underwater, Langdon turned his head and gazed through the reddish haze toward the Mona Lisa. The fleur-de-lis… the flower of Lisa… the Mona Lisa.
