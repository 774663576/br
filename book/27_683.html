<div class="line_en">To anyone who spent time with Elizabeth, it was clear that she worshipped Jobs and Apple. She liked to call Theranos's blood-testing system "the iPod of health care" and predicted that, like Apple's ubiquitous products, it would someday be in every household in the country.</div>

<div class="line_en">For a young entrepreneur building a business in the heart of Silicon Valley, it was hard to escape the shadow of Steve Jobs. By 2007, Apple's founder had cemented his legend in the technology world and in American society at large by bringing the computer maker back from the ashes with the iMac, the iPod, and the iTunes music store. In January of that year, he unveiled his latest and biggest stroke of genius, the iPhone, before a rapturous audience at the Macworld conference in San Francisco.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ana's first meeting with Elizabeth was at Coupa Café, a hip coffee and sandwich place in Palo Alto that had become her favorite haunt outside the office. After filling her in on her background and her travels to Asia, Elizabeth told Ana she envisioned building a disease map of each person through Theranos's blood tests. The company would then be able to reverse engineer illnesses like cancer with mathematical models that would crunch the blood data and predict the evolution of tumors.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ana joined Theranos as its chief design architect. This mostly meant she was responsible for the overall look and feel of the Edison. Elizabeth wanted a software touchscreen similar to the iPhone's and a sleek outer case for the machine. The case, she decreed, should have two colors separated by a diagonal cut, like the original iMac. But unlike that first iMac, it couldn't be translucent. It had to hide the robotic arm and the rest of the Edison's innards.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="安娜加入Theranos担任设计长，这意味着她要负责爱迪生的整体外观和触感。伊莉莎白希望有类似iPhone的软件触摸屏幕，以及线条流畅的外壳。她指示外壳必须两个颜色相间，以一条对角线分隔，就像一开始的iMac一样，不过不能跟iMac一样半透明，因为必须隐藏爱迪生的机器手臂等内部结构。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It sounded impressive and world changing to a medical neophyte like Ana, and Elizabeth seemed brilliant. But given that Ana would be leaving behind fifteen thousand Apple shares if she joined Theranos, she wanted to get her wife Corrine's opinion. She arranged to meet Elizabeth again in Palo Alto, this time with Corrine present. Any hesitations she had were put to rest when Elizabeth made a big impression on Corrine too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对安娜这种医疗菜鸟来说，这听起来是改变世界的大事业，而且伊莉莎白似乎聪明绝顶。不过，若她加入Theranos就得放弃一万五千股苹果股票，因此她想听听另一半柯琳（Corrine）的意见。她跟伊莉莎白约好在帕罗奥图第二次会面，这次柯琳一同出席。柯琳对伊莉莎白留下极好的印象，安娜的疑虑一扫而空。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She'd contracted out the case's design to Yves Béhar, the Swiss-born industrial designer whose reputation in the Valley was second only to Apple's Jony Ive. Béhar came up with an elegant black-and-white design that proved difficult to build. Tony Nugent and Dave Nelson spent countless hours molding sheet metal in an attempt to get it right.</div>

<div class="line_en">The case wouldn't conceal the loud noises the robotic arm made, but Ana was satisfied that it would at least make the device presentable when Elizabeth took it out on demos.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个外壳并不能隐藏机器手臂制造的巨大噪音，不过安娜已经很满意，至少伊莉莎白带出去展示时，端得上台面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ana felt that Elizabeth could use a makeover herself. The way she dressed was decidedly unfashionable. She wore wide gray pantsuits and Christmas sweaters that made her look like a frumpy accountant. People in her entourage like Channing Robertson and Don Lucas were beginning to compare her to Steve Jobs. If so, she should dress the part, she told her. Elizabeth took the suggestion to heart. From that point on, she came to work in a black turtleneck and black slacks most days.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="安娜觉得伊莉莎白本人也该彻底改头换面，她的穿着打扮完全称不上时髦，宽松的灰色长裤套装和圣诞毛衣让她像个邋遢过时的会计师。她告诉伊莉莎白，在她身边的钱宁．罗伯森和唐纳．卢卡斯等人，都开始把她比喻为史帝夫．贾伯斯，那她就应该穿出那个样子。伊莉莎白把她的建议听进去了，从那一刻开始，她大多穿黑色套头上衣和黑色长裤来上班。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ana was soon joined at Theranos by Justin Maxwell and Mike Bauerly, two other recruits hired to work on the design of the Edison's software and other parts of the system that patients would interact with, like the packaging for the cartridges. Ana and Justin had worked together at Apple and knew Mike through his girlfriend, who had been a colleague of theirs there. It wasn't long before the Apple transplants began noticing that Elizabeth and Theranos had their quirks. Ana would arrive early every morning for a daily seven-thirty meeting with Elizabeth to update her on design issues. When she pulled her car into the parking lot, Ana would find her jamming to loud hip-hop music in her black Infiniti SUV, the blond streaks in her hair bouncing wildly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不久，贾斯汀．麦斯维尔（Justin Maxwell）和麦克．包尔利（Mike Bauerly）也加入安娜、来到Theranos，负责设计爱迪生的软件以及其他须由病人操作的部分，譬如把卡匣装进去。安娜和贾斯汀曾在苹果共事，而两人之所以结识麦克，是因为麦克的女友是他们在苹果的同事。没多久，来自苹果的两人开始发现伊莉莎白和Theranos的古怪之处。安娜每天很早进公司，七点半就跟伊莉莎白开会报告设计方面的最新进度。每当她把车停进停车场，便看到伊莉莎白坐在她黑色的Infiniti休旅车，车里的嘻哈音乐震耳欲聋，她金色的头发随着音乐狂野摆荡。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One day, as Justin walked into her office to update her on a project, Elizabeth motioned him over excitedly, saying she wanted to show him something. She pointed to a nine-inch-long metal paperweight on her desk. Etched on it was the phrase, "What would you attempt to do if you knew you could not fail?" She'd positioned it so the words were facing her and clearly found it inspiring.</div>

<div class="line_en">Having an idealistic boss wasn't a bad thing, but there were other aspects of working at Theranos that were less pleasant. One of them was having to do daily battle with Matt Bissel, the head of IT, and his sidekick, Nathan Lortz. Bissel and Lortz had the company's computer network set up in such a way that information was split into silos, hampering communication between employees and departments. You couldn't even exchange instant messages with a coworker. The chat ports were blocked. It was all in the name of protecting proprietary information and trade secrets, but the end result was hours of lost productivity.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有个充满理想的老板并非坏事，不过在Theranos工作也有不怎么愉快之处。其中之一是每天必须对抗IT主管麦特．毕叟以及他的副手内森．洛兹（Nathan Lortz）。毕叟和洛兹把电脑网络设置成：信息切割得四分五裂，遏阻员工和部门之间的沟通，就连跟同事互通即时消息都没办法，封锁聊天通信端口（chat port），全出于保护信息与商业机密为由，结果却是浪费好几个小时的生产力。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The situation got so frustrating that Justin stayed up late one night and wrote a long email screed to Ana about it.</div>

<div class="line_en">One of the assistants kept track of when employees arrived and when they left so that Elizabeth knew exactly how many hours everyone put in. To entice people into working longer days, she had dinner catered every evening. The food often didn't arrive until eight or eight thirty, which meant that the earliest you got out of the office was ten.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其中一位助理会追踪记录员工几点到公司、几点下班，所以伊莉莎白对每个人到底花了多少时间工作，一清二楚。为了诱使员工工作久一点，公司每晚供应晚餐，食物通常要到八点或八点半才会送达，也就是说，最快也要十点才能离开办公室。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Justin and Mike also got the distinct impression that Bissel and Lortz were spying on them and reporting their findings back to Elizabeth. The IT team always wanted to know what programs they were running on their computers and at times turned suspiciously friendly in what felt like transparent attempts to elicit seditious gossip. The snooping wasn't confined to the IT guys. Elizabeth's administrative assistants would friend employees on Facebook and tell her what they were posting there.</div>

<div class="line_en">The strange atmosphere got even stranger when the Theranos board convened once a quarter. Employees were instructed to appear busy and not to make eye contact with the board members when they walked through the office. Elizabeth ushered them into a big glass conference room and pulled down the shades. It felt like CIA agents conducting secret debriefings with an undercover operative.</div>

<div class="line_en">One evening, Ana gave Justin and Aaron Moore, one of the engineers, a ride back to San Francisco. Aaron had dropped out of a Ph. D. program in microfluidics at MIT and come to work at Theranos in September 2006 after spotting a small job ad in a trade publication. He'd worked at the company nearly a year by the time Ana and Justin came on board. Aaron was smart enough to have gone to college at Stanford and grad school at MIT, but he didn't take himself too seriously. He was originally from Portland, Oregon, and had the Portlandian hipster's look: shaggy hair, a three-day beard, and earrings. He was also witty, all of which made him the one person at Theranos the Apple transplants could relate to.</div>

<div class="line_en">Aaron mentioned that he was also troubled by the study with cancer patients in Tennessee. They'd never gotten the microfluidic system anywhere close to working properly and certainly not well enough to use on live patients, and yet Elizabeth had pushed ahead with the study. The shift to the new machine Tony built was an improvement, but Aaron felt they still didn't have a good read on its performance. The engineering and chemistry groups weren't communicating. Each was running tests on the parts of the system it was responsible for, but no one was conducting overall system tests.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="亚伦提到，田纳西的癌症病人研究也令他不安。他们做的微流控系统连可运转的边都还摸不上，更别说用在活生生的患者身上了，可是伊莉莎白却一意孤行。东尼打造的新机器的确是一大进展，但是亚伦觉得机器性能还不够好，工程和化学团队缺乏沟通，各做各的测试，只做自己负责的部分，没有人负责系统整体的检测。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ana, Justin, and Aaron all lived in San Francisco and commuted by car or train to the office. During their drive home that evening, Aaron shared some gripes he had with his new colleagues as they sat in traffic in Ana's Prius. In case they hadn't noticed yet, people were constantly getting fired at Theranos, Aaron told them. Ana and Justin had definitely noticed. The Ed Ku layoffs had just taken place. In addition to Ed, twenty other people had lost their jobs. It happened so fast that Ed had left a bunch of work tools behind, including a nice set of X-Acto precision cutting knives that Justin had fished out of a wastebasket and claimed as his own.</div>

<div class="line_en">What Ana and Aaron didn't know and what might have allayed their concerns somewhat is that the test results Theranos generated from the cancer patients' blood would not be used to make any changes to their treatments. They were to be used only for research purposes, to help Pfizer assess the effectiveness of Theranos's technology. But that was never clear to most Theranos employees because Elizabeth never explained the terms of the study.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ana listened with rising unease. She'd assumed Theranos had perfected its blood-testing technology if it was going to be used on patients.

Ana met Avie at a Peet's Coffee in Los Altos and mentioned what she'd learned from Aaron Moore. She worried that Theranos was crossing an ethical line with the Tennessee study.

She'd come across as a bright young lady who was passionate about what she was doing, exactly the qualities you looked for in an entrepreneur. Her eyes had lit up when he volunteered some pieces of management wisdom he'd learned at Apple. His long association with Jobs seemed an object of fascination to her.

<div class="line_en">The first couple of board meetings Avie attended had been relatively uneventful, but, by the third one, he'd begun to notice a pattern. Elizabeth would present increasingly rosy revenue projections based on the deals she said Theranos was negotiating with pharmaceutical companies, but the revenues wouldn't materialize. It didn't help that Henry Mosley, the chief financial officer, had been fired soon after Avie became a director. At the last board meeting he'd attended, Avie had asked more pointed questions about the pharmaceutical deals and been told they were held up in legal review. When he'd asked to see the contracts, Elizabeth had said she didn't have any copies readily available.</div>

<div class="line_en">There were also repeated delays with the product's rollout and the explanation for what needed to be fixed kept changing.

<div class="line_en">Except Avie didn't think it was good corporate governance to do what Elizabeth wanted. Since she would control the foundation, she would also control the voting rights associated with the new stock, which would increase her overall voting stake. Avie didn't think it was in other shareholders' interest to give the founder more power. He objected.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="艾维认为，放任伊莉莎白想做什么就做并不是好的公司治理，除此之外，由于基金会由她掌控，所以基金会股份的表决权也会落入她手上，这等于增加了她手上所掌握的表决权。艾维认为赋予她更多权力并不符合股东利益，所以他反对。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In late October 2007, he attended a meeting of the board's compensation committee. Don Lucas, the board's chairman, told the committee members that Elizabeth planned to create a foundation for tax-planning purposes and wanted the committee to approve a special grant of stock to it. Avie had noticed how much Don doted on Elizabeth. The old man treated her like a granddaughter. A portly gentleman with white hair who liked to wear broad-brim hats, Don was in his late seventies and was part of an older generation of venture capitalists who approached venture investing as if it were a private club. He'd mentored one famous entrepreneur in Larry Ellison. In Elizabeth, he clearly thought he'd found another.</div>

<div class="line_en">Two weeks later, he received a call from Don asking if they could meet. Avie drove to the old man's office on Sand Hill Road. Elizabeth was really upset, Don informed him when he got there. She felt he was behaving unpleasantly during board meetings and didn't think he should be on the board anymore. Don asked if he wanted to resign. Avie expressed surprise. He was just fulfilling his duties as a director; asking questions was one of them. Don agreed and said he thought Avie was doing an excellent job. Avie told Don he wanted to take a few days to think things over.</div>

<div class="line_en">During one of their early morning meetings, Ana confronted Elizabeth with what she'd heard from Aaron Moore about problems with the Theranos system.

They could always restart it once they got the machine working reliably, she told her.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ana's own relationship with Elizabeth was deteriorating. Elizabeth didn't like being told no, and Ana had done so on several occasions when she'd found a demand Elizabeth made unreasonable. She was also getting put off by her secrecy. A designer might not be as crucial to this little enterprise as an engineer or a chemist, but she still needed to be in the information loop about the product's development to do her job properly. Yet Elizabeth kept Ana on a need-to-know basis.</div>

<div class="line_en">Don Lucas didn't use email.

Shaunak Roy, Theranos's first employee and de facto cofounder, was leaving the company and selling most of his founder's shares back to Elizabeth.

<div class="line_en">When the documents arrived, Avie read them carefully and concluded that, once the company itself waived its rights to repurchase Shaunak's shares, it was entirely within his and other shareholders' rights to buy some of them. He also noticed that Elizabeth had negotiated a sweetheart deal: Shaunak was willing to part with his 1.13 million shares for $565,000. That translated to 50 cents a share, an 82 percent discount to what he and other investors had paid more than a year earlier in Theranos's last funding round. Some discount was warranted because Avie's shares were preferred shares with higher claims on the company's assets and earnings while Shaunak's shares were common ones, but a discount that big was unheard of.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等到文档寄来，艾维仔细看完，得到的结论是：一旦公司放弃买回萧内克股份的权利，艾维和其他股东就有权利认购那些股票。他还发现，伊莉莎白谈到一笔极为有利的交易，萧内克愿意以五十六万五千美元出让他持有的一百一十三万股，等于一股只要〇‧五美元，是他和其他投资人一年多前在Theranos上一轮募资的购入价格打了一八折。打点折扣是应该的，因为艾维的股份是优先股，对公司的资产和盈余有优先权，而萧内克的股份是普通股，不过这么大的折扣倒是前所未闻。">查看中文翻译</div>
