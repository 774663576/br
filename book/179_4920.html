<div class="line_en">"Oh my God! I was expecting something like this," she said. "When Joseph came and told us your father had arrived, my heart stopped as though he'd brought bad news. Poor dear! And I'm to blame for all your troubles. Perhaps it would be better for you to leave me than quarrel with your father. Still, I never did him any harm. We live very quietly and we'll live more quietly still. Of course, he realizes that you must have a mistress, and he should be pleased it's me, because I love you and won't ask you for anything more than your circumstances warrant. Did you tell him what we've worked out for the future?"</div>

<div class="line_en">In the end, she fell asleep in my arms, but her sleep was the kind which wearies the body instead of giving it rest.

<div class="line_en">She seemed to be a little calmer during the evening and, motioning me to sit at the foot of her bed, she gave me lengthy, renewed assurances that she loved me. Then she smiled, though it was an effort for her to do so, for despite herself her eyes were masked with tears.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="傍晚，她似乎稍许平静了一些。她叫我坐在她的床脚边，又絮絮叨叨地对我重复着她对爱情的忠贞。随后，她又对我嫣然一笑，但很勉强，因为无论她怎样克制，她的眼睛里总是含着眼泪。">查看中文翻译</div>
