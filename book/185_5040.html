<div class="line_en">What had really happened was this. When Aravis saw Shasta hurried away by the Narnians and found herself alone with two horses who (very wisely) wouldn't say a word, she never lost her head even for a moment. She grabbed Bree's halter and stood still, holding both the horses; and though her heart was beating as hard as a hammer, she did nothing to show it. As soon as the Narnian lords had passed she tried to move on again. But before she could take a step, another crier ("Bother all these people" thought Aravis) was heard shouting out, "Way, way, way! Way for the Tarkheena Lasaraleen!" and immediately, following the crier, came four armed slaves and then four bearers carrying a litter which was all a-flutter with silken curtains and all a-jingle with silver bells and which scented the whole street with perfumes and flowers. After the litter, female slaves in beautiful clothes, and then a few grooms, runners, pages, and the like. And now Aravis made her first mistake.</div>

<div class="line_en">The bearers had stopped and the litter was being lowered. When the curtains had been drawn Aravis found that she was in a courtyard-garden very like the one that Shasta had been taken into a few minutes earlier in another part of the city. Lasaraleen would have gone indoors at once but Aravis reminded her in a frantic whisper to say something to the slaves about not telling anyone of their mistress's strange visitor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="轿夫停下步来，放下轿子。轿帘拉开时，阿拉维斯发现自己已在一个庭院里了，就跟几分钟前在城市的另一个地方沙斯塔被带进去的那个院子差不多。拉斯阿拉莉恩本来立刻就要走进门去，但阿拉维斯用疯疯癫癫的低语提醒她要对奴隶们嘱咐几句，别跟任何人提起女主人的怪客。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Sorry, darling, it had gone right out of my head," said Lasareleen. "Here. All of you. And you, doorkeeper. No one is to be let out of the house today. And anyone I catch talking about this young lady will be first beaten to death and then burned alive and after that be kept on bread and water for six weeks. There."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对不起，宝贝儿，我完全忘记了。”拉斯阿拉莉恩说道，“听着，你们大家，还有你，门房。不论谁讲起这位年轻女士，如果被我逮住了，首先就要打得半死不活，其次就要活活焚烧，然后是接连六个星期不给面包吃，不给水喝。就这样。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Although Lasaraleen had said she was dying to hear Aravis's story, she showed no sign of really wanting to hear it at all. She was, in fact, much better at talking than at listening. She insisted on Aravis having a long and luxurious bath (Calormene baths are famous) and then dressing her up in the finest clothes before she would let her explain anything. The fuss she made about choosing the dresses nearly drove Aravis mad. She remembered now that Lasaraleen had always been like that, interested in clothes and parties and gossip. Aravis had always been more interested in bows and arrows and horses and dogs and swimming. You will guess that each thought the other silly. But when at last they were both seated after a meal (it was chiefly of the whipped cream and jelly and fruit and ice sort) in a beautiful pillared room (which Aravis would have liked better if Lasaraleen's spoiled pet monkey hadn't been climbing about it all the time) Lasaraleen at last asked her why she was running away from home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然拉斯阿拉莉恩说过，她很想听阿拉维斯的不幸故事，却压根儿没有表露出确实想听的迹象。事实上，听和说相比，她说起来要胜任愉快得多。她坚持要阿拉维斯洗个漫长而奢侈的澡（卡乐门的洗澡是世界闻名的），用最好的衣服把她打扮起来，然后才容许她解释点儿什么事情。在选择衣服上的小题大做，几乎把阿拉维斯搞得恼火了。这时她记起来了，拉斯阿拉莉恩始终是这个样子的：对衣着打扮、社交聚会和闲谈聊天感兴趣。阿拉维斯始终对弓、箭、犬、马和游泳更感兴趣。但当她们吃过饭（主要是掼油、果子冻、冰水果之类），两个人一起坐在美丽的圆柱房间里（如果被拉斯阿拉莉恩宠坏了的猴子不是始终在爬来爬去，阿拉维斯会更加喜欢这房间的），拉斯阿拉莉恩终于问她为什么从家里逃出来了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When Aravis had finished telling her story, Lasaraleen said, "But, darling, why don't you marry Ahoshta Tarkaan? Everyone's crazy about him. My husband says he is beginning to be one of the greatest men in Calormen. He has just been made Grand Vizier now old Axartha has died. Didn't you know?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="向拉维斯讲完她的故事，拉斯阿拉莉恩说道“可是，宝贝儿，你干吗不嫁给泰坎阿霍什塔呢？谁都在为他发疯着迷哩。我的丈夫说，他将成为卡乐门最伟大的人物。如今老阿克萨沙死了，他刚刚荣升首相，你知道吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don't care. I can't stand the sight of him," said Aravis.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我可不在乎。我看到他就受不了。”阿拉维斯说道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But, darling, only think! Three palaces, and one of them that beautiful one down on the lake at Ilkeen. Positively ropes of pearls, I'm told. Baths of asses' milk. And you'd see such a lot of me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可是，宝贝儿，你倒考虑考虑！三个府邸，其中一个美丽极了，就在伊尔基茵的湖滨。我听人家说，确实是珍珠大串大串的。用驴乳洗澡。而且你可以经常遇见我。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“他不妨留着他的珍珠和府邸吧，这些东西跟我可不相干。”阿拉维斯说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the end, however, Aravis managed to make her friend believe that she was in earnest and even to discuss plans. There would be no difficulty now about getting the two horses out of the North gate and then on to the Tombs. No one would stop or question a groom in fine clothes leading a war horse and a lady's saddle horse down to the river, and Lasaraleen had plenty of grooms to send. It wasn't so easy to decide what to do about Aravis herself. She suggested that she could be carried out in the litter with the curtains drawn. But Lasaraleen told her that litters were only used in the city and the sight of one going out through the gate would be certain to lead to questions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是，说到后来，阿拉维斯还是设法使她的朋友相信她是认真的，甚至讨论起计划来了。现在两匹马儿要出北城城门赶到坟场去，是不会有什么困难的了。没有人会阻挡或盘问一个衣服华丽的侍从带着一匹战马和一位女士的坐骑到河滨去的，拉斯阿拉莉恩家有许多侍从可以随意差遣。不容易决定的事情是阿拉维斯本人该怎么办。她提议她可以坐在轿子里，拉下轿帘，让人抬出城去。但拉斯阿拉莉恩告诉她，轿子只在城里使用，看到一顶轿子出城门而去，一定会引起人们的疑问。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When they had talked for a long time -- and it was all the longer because Aravis found it hard to keep her friend to the point-at last Lasaraleen clapped her hands and said, "Oh, I have an idea. There is one way of getting out of the city without using the gates. The Tisroc's garden (may he live for ever!) runs right down to the water and there is a little water-door. Only for the palace people of course -- but then you know, dear (here she tittered a little) we almost are palace people. I say, it is lucky for you that you came to me. The dear Tisroc (may he live for ever!) is so kind. We're asked to the palace almost every day and it is like a second home. I love all the dear princes and princesses and I positively adore Prince Rabadash. I might run in and see any of the palace ladies at any hour of the day or night. Why shouldn't I slip in withyou, after dark, and let you out by the water-door? There are always a few punts and things tied up outside it. And even if we were caught --"</div>

<div class="line_en">"And with a peasant boy, too!" said Lasaraleen. "Darling, think of it! It's not Nice." Aravis had thought of it a good deal, but she was so tired of Lasaraleen's silliness by now that, for the first time, she began to think that travelling with Shasta was really rather more fun than fashionable life in Tashbaan. So she only replied, "You forget that I'll be nobody, just like him, when we get to Narnia. And anyway, I promised."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“而且和一个乡下孩子同去！”拉斯阿拉莉恩说道，“宝贝儿，你倒考虑考虑！那可不妙。”阿拉维斯考虑过很多，但如今她对拉斯阿拉莉恩的糊涂无知实在感觉厌倦了，她第一次开始想到同沙斯塔一起旅行赶路，确实比塔什班城里时髦的上流社会生活要有趣得多。所以她只是答道“你忘记了一点：我们到达纳尼亚时，我便将是个无名小卒了，就像他一样。而且，无论如何，原是我答允了一起去的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But the next day passed very slowly. Lasaraleen wanted to go back on the whole arrangement and kept on telling Aravis that Narnia was a country of perpetual snow and ice inhabited by demons and sorcerers, and she was mad to think of going there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但第二天过得十分缓慢。拉斯阿拉莉恩想要取消原来的整个安排，不断地告诉阿拉维斯，纳尼亚是个永远下雪结冰的国家，住着恶魔和巫师，她要到那儿去简直是发疯。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And to think," said Lasaraleen, almost crying, "that if only you had sense you could be the wife of a Grand Vizier!" Aravis went away to have a private word with the horses.</div>

<div class="line_en">The two girls went out on foot. A very few minutes brought them to the palace gates. Here there were of course soldiers on guard but the officer knew Lasaraleen quite well and called his men to attention and saluted. They passed at once into the Hall of Black Marble. A fair number of courtiers, slaves and others were still moving about here but this only made the two girls less conspicuous. They passed on into the Hall of Pillars and then into the Hall of Statues and down the colonnade, passing the great beatencopper doors of the throne room. It was all magnificent beyond description; what they could see of it in the dim light of the lamps.</div>

<div class="line_en">Presently they came out into the garden-court which sloped downhill in a number of terraces. On the far side of that they came to the Old Palace. It had already grown almost quite dark and they now found themselves in a maze of corridors lit only by occasional torches fixed in brackets to the walls. Lasaraleen halted at a place where you had to go either left or right.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不久她们就出了宫殿，进入御花园，花园依着山势经过许多台地迤逦而下。她们在花园另一边来到旧王宫。天色已经变得十分昏暗了，现在她们发觉自己置身于回廊的迷宫之中，墙上偶尔有个托架插着火炬照明。拉斯阿拉莉恩在一个岔路口停步不前了：非此即彼，你要么往左走，要么往右走。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They took the left hand way and found themselves in a passage that was hardly lighted at all and which soon began going down steps.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她们走上了左边的那条路，发觉置身在一条压根儿没有什么亮光的通道里，这通道不久就变成了一级又一级向下延伸的台阶。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's all right," said Lasaraleen. "I'm sure we're right now. I remember these steps." But at that moment a moving light appeared ahead. A second later there appeared from round a distant corner, the dark shapes of two men walking backwards and carrying tall candles. And of course it is only before royalties that people walk backwards. Aravis felt Lasaraleen grip her arm -- that sort of sudden grip which is almost a pinch and which means that the person who is gripping you is very frightened indeed. Aravis thought it odd that Lasaraleen should be so afraid of the Tisroc if he were really such a friend of hers, but there was no time to go on thinking. Lasaraleen was hurrying her back to the top of the steps, on tiptoes, and groping wildly along the wall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对了，”拉斯阿拉莉恩说道，“我有把握我们现在是走对了。我记得这一级级的台阶。”但就在这当儿，前面出现一个移动的亮光。一秒钟后，从一个遥远的角落里出现了两个人的黑影，他们手执高大的蜡烛，正在往后倒退着走哩。当然啼，只有在国王和王族面前，人们才倒退着走的。阿拉维斯觉得拉斯阿拉莉恩抓住她的手臂——这种突然一抓，几乎是拧了把，意味着那伸手抓的人实际上十分惶恐。阿拉维斯认为这事很奇怪，拉斯阿拉莉恩竟会那么害怕蒂斯罗克，如果蒂斯罗克确实是她的朋友；但阿拉维斯也没有时间继续思考这个问题。拉斯阿拉莉恩正催促她赶紧返回台阶的顶上，发疯似的沿着墙垣摸索前进。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm just wondering…" said Lasaraleen. "I'm not absolutely sure which way we go from here. I think it's the left. Yes, I'm almost sure it's the left. What fun this is!"</div>

<div class="line_en">There was just room between the sofa and the curtained wall and the two girls got down. Lasaraleen managed to get the better position and was completely covered. The upper part of Aravis's face stuck out beyond the sofa, so that if anyone came into that room with a light and happened to look in exactly the right place they would see her. But of course, because she was wearing a veil, what they saw would not at once look like a forehead and a pair of eyes. Aravis shoved desperately to try to make Lasaraleen give her a little more room. But Lasaraleen, now quite selfish in her panic, fought back and pinched her feet. They gave it up and lay still, panting a little. Their own breath semed dreadfully noisy, but there was no other noise.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="沙发与幕墙之间恰好有地方给这两个姑娘躺下。拉斯阿拉莉恩设法占据较好的位置，把自己的身体完全遮住了。阿拉维斯上半个脸在沙发背后露了出来，所以，如果有什么人手中拿着个灯走进房间，碰巧朝这个角落一望，就会看见她了。当然，由于她戴着面纱，乍一看倒不会像是一个前额和一双眼睛。阿拉维斯拼命推操，竭力使拉斯阿拉莉恩腾一点儿地方给她。但拉斯阿拉莉恩如今在惊慌失措中十分自私，她把对方挤回去，还拧她的脚。她们绝望了，动也不动地躺着，稍微有点儿气喘。她们的呼吸似乎响得可怕，但室内没有其他声音。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I -- I -- think so," began Lasaraleen. "But my poor nerves --" and then came the most terrible noise they could have heard at that moment: the noise of the door opening. And then came light. And because Aravis couldn't get her head any further in behind the sofa, she saw everything.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我——我——我想是安全的，”拉斯阿拉莉恩说道。“我那可怜的神经…”于是传来了此时此刻她们所能听到的最最可怕的声音。开门的声音。然后是灯光。因为阿拉维斯在沙发背后可以伸长脖子，她什么都看在眼里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">First came the two slaves (deaf and dumb, as Aravis rightly guessed, and therefore used at the most secret councils) walking backwards and carrying the candles. They took up their stand one at each end of the sofa. This was a good thing, for of course it was now harder for anyone to see Aravis once a slave was in front of her and she was looking between his heels. Then came an old man, very fat, wearing a curious pointed cap by which she immediately knew that he was the Tisroc. The least of the jewels with which he was covered was worth more than all the clothes and weapons of the Narnian lords put together: but he was so fat and such a mass of frills and pleats and bobbles and buttons and tassels and talismans that Aravis couldn't help thinking the Narnian fashions (at any rate for men) looked nicer. After him came a tall young man with a feathered and jewelled turban on his head and an ivory-sheathed scimitar at his side. He seemed very excited and his eyes and teeth flashed fiercely in the candlelight. Last of all came a little hump-backed, wizened old man in whom she recognized with a shudder the new Grand Vizier and her own betrothed husband, Ahoshta Tarkaan himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="首先进来两个奴隶（又聋又哑，正如阿拉维斯所猜到的，以便开最秘密的会议），手持蜡烛，倒退着走进来。他们站定在沙发的两头。这倒是件好事，因为一旦阿拉维斯的前面站了个奴隶，当然任何人就更难看到她了，而她却可以在奴隶的两个脚跟之间向外张望。接着进来的是一个老头儿，很胖，戴一顶稀奇古怪的尖顶帽子，凭着这帽子，她立刻知道他就是蒂斯罗克了。他浑身上下都是珠宝首饰，其价值至少也要超过纳尼亚王族所有衣服和武器加起来的总价值，但他是那么胖，还有那么一大堆饰边、皱裙、小羊毛球、纽扣、流苏、辟邪物，阿拉维斯禁不住想到纳尼亚的时装（无论如何是给人穿的）看上去要雅致得多了。蒂斯罗克之后，来了个高大的年轻人，头上裹着一个插羽毛、镶珠宝的头巾，身边佩一把象牙革肖的弯刀。他似乎很激动，他的眼睛和牙齿凶狠地在烛光里闪烁。最后，进来一个驼背、枯搞的小老头儿，她浑身不寒而栗，认出小老头儿就是新首相，自己新订婚的丈夫，泰坎阿霍什塔本人。">查看中文翻译</div>
