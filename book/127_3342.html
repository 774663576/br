You can do that with people you never speak to at all. You can just watch them, and think about them and be sorry for them, until they seem almost like relations. I'm quite anxious sometimes when I see the doctor call twice a day."</div>

<div class="line_en">When one lives in a row of houses, it is interesting to think of the things which are being done and said on the other side of the wall of the very rooms one is living in. Sara was fond of amusing herself by trying to imagine the things hidden by the wall which divided the Select Seminary from the Indian gentleman's house. She knew that the schoolroom was next to the Indian gentleman's study, and she hoped that the wall was thick so that the noise made sometimes after lesson hours would not disturb him.</div>

<div class="line_en">She had become fond of the Large Family because they looked happy; but she had become fond of the Indian gentleman because he looked unhappy. He had evidently not fully recovered from some very severe illness. In the kitchen -- where, of course, the servants, through some mysterious means, knew everything -- there was much discussion of his case. He was not an Indian gentleman really, but an Englishman who had lived in India. He had met with great misfortunes which had for a time so imperilled his whole fortune that he had thought himself ruined and disgraced forever. The shock had been so great that he had almost died of brain fever; and ever since he had been shattered in health, though his fortunes had changed and all his possessions had been restored to him. His trouble and peril had been connected with mines.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Perhaps you can FEEL if you can't hear," was her fancy. "Perhaps kind thoughts reach people somehow, even through windows and doors and walls. Perhaps you feel a little warm and comforted, and don't know why, when I am standing here in the cold and hoping you will get well and happy again. I am so sorry for you," she would whisper in an intense little voice. "I wish you had a `Little Missus' who could pet you as I used to pet papa when he had a headache. I should like to be your `Little Missus' myself, poor dear! Good night -- good night. God bless you!"</div>

When she was sent out at night she used sometimes to feel quite glad, because there was always a chance that the curtains of the house next door might not yet be closed and she could look into the warm room and see her adopted friend. When no one was about she used sometimes to stop, and, holding to the iron railings, wish him good night as if he could hear her.</div>

<div class="line_en">She would go away, feeling quite comforted and a little warmer herself. Her sympathy was so strong that it seemed as if it MUST reach him somehow as he sat alone in his armchair by the fire, nearly always in a great dressing gown, and nearly always with his forehead resting in his hand as he gazed hopelessly into the fire. He looked to Sara like a man who had a trouble on his mind still, not merely like one whose troubles lay all in the past.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她走开时会感到十分宽慰，心里也温暧些了。她的同情心是那样强烈，似乎不知怎的一定能感染他，他这时正独自坐在炉边那把安乐椅中，几乎总是穿着一件宽大的晨衣，一手支撑着前额，绝望地注视着炉火。他的样子在萨拉看来仍是个心中怀着烦恼的人，而不仅仅像是个已经把烦恼全抛掉的人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He always seems as if he were thinking of something that hurts him NOW, she said to herself, "but he has got his money back and he will get over his brain fever in time, so he ought not to look like that. I wonder if there is something else."</div>

<div class="line_en">If there was something else -- something even servants did not hear of -- she could not help believing that the father of the Large Family knew it -- the gentleman she called Mr. Montmorency. Mr. Montmorency went to see him often, and Mrs. Montmorency and all the little Montmorencys went, too, though less often. He seemed particularly fond of the two elder little girls -- the Janet and Nora who had been so alarmed when their small brother Donald had given Sara his sixpence. He had, in fact, a very tender place in his heart for all children, and particularly for little girls. Janet and Nora were as fond of him as he was of them, and looked forward with the greatest pleasure to the afternoons when they were allowed to cross the square and make their well-behaved little visits to him. They were extremely decorous little visits because he was an invalid.</div>

<div class="line_en">Janet was the head of the family, and kept the rest of it in order. It was she who decided when it was discreet to ask the Indian gentleman to tell stories about India, and it was she who saw when he was tired and it was the time to steal quietly away and tell Ram Dass to go to him. They were very fond of Ram Dass. He could have told any number of stories if he had been able to speak anything but Hindustani. The Indian gentleman's real name was Mr. Carrisford, and Janet told Mr. Carrisford about the encounter with the little-girl-who-was-not-a-beggar. He was very much interested, and all the more so when he heard from Ram Dass of the adventure of the monkey on the roof. Ram Dass made for him a very clear picture of the attic and its desolateness -- of the bare floor and broken plaster, the rusty, empty grate, and the hard, narrow bed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="珍尼特是家庭中的首脑，使家中的其他成员都听她的话。是她决定在什么妥善的时间去请求那位印度绅士讲关于印度的故事，也是她发觉什么时候他疲倦了，该悄悄离开，并且吩咐拉姆·达斯到他身边去。她们很喜欢拉姆·达斯。如果他除了兴都斯坦语外还能讲別的语言的话，他就可能已经讲了许许多多故事了。那位印度绅士的真名叫做卡里斯福特先生，珍尼特告诉了卡里斯福特先生关于和那个“不是乞丐的小姑娘”相遇的事。他很感兴趣。当他从拉姆。达斯那里听说那猴子在屋顶上的冒险行动时，就更感兴趣了。拉姆·达斯给他描述了一幅关于那阁楼的凄凉情况的清晰景象——没有地毯的地板、破损的白粉墙、生锈的空炉架以及那又硬又窄的床。">查看中文翻译</div>

An English officer in India had placed his motherless little girl at the school. He had died suddenly after losing his fortune." Mr. Carmichael paused a moment, as if a new thought had occurred to him. "Are you SURE the child was left at a school in Paris? Are you sure it was Paris?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“听帕斯卡尔夫人念起来，好像是卡鲁而不是克鲁——但是那可能只是个发音问题。情况是出奇地相似。一位在印度的英国军官曾把他那没娘的小女儿放进这所学校。而他破产后突然死去了。”卡迈克尔先生停顿了片刻，似乎突然有了一个新的想法。“你能肯定那孩子是被放在巴黎的一所学校里的吗？你能肯定是巴黎吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Good God! Yes," he said. "I was driven mad with dread and horror. I had not slept for weeks. The night I staggered out of my house all the air seemed full of hideous things mocking and mouthing at me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“天啊！是的，”他说，“那时我担惊受怕，简直发疯了。有好几个星期睡不着觉。我摇摇晃晃走出房屋的那天夜里，整个天空中似乎都充满了骇人的怪物在嘲笑我，冲着我叫骂。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"And when I returned to consciousness poor Crewe was dead -- and buried. And I seemed to remember nothing. I did not remember the child for months and months. Even when I began to recall her existence everything seemed in a sort of haze."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“等我恢复了神志，可怜的克鲁已经死了——给埋葬了。而我似乎什么也记不起来。一连好几个月，我不记得那孩子。甚至当我开始想起她的存在时，一切都像在雾霭中那样模糊。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Come, come," said Carmichael. "We shall find her yet. We will continue to search for Madame Pascal's good-natured Russians. She seemed to have a vague idea that they lived in Moscow. We will take that as a clue. I will go to Moscow."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“得了，得了，”卡迈克尔说。“我们早晚会找到她的。我们要继续寻找帕斯卡尔夫人的那两位好心的俄国人。她似乎依稀记得他们住在莫斯科。我们可以拿这一点作为线索。我要去莫斯科。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He stopped a moment and rubbed his forehead. "It sometimes seems so now when I try to remember. Surely I must sometime have heard Crewe speak of the school she was sent to. Don't you think so?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"He used to call her by an odd pet name he had invented. He called her his `Little Missus.' But the wretched mines drove everything else out of our heads. We talked of nothing else. If he spoke of the school, I forgot -- I forgot. And now I shall never remember."</div>

<div class="line_en">"If I were able to travel, I would go with you," said Carrisford; "but I can only sit here wrapped in furs and stare at the fire. And when I look into it I seem to see Crewe's gay young face gazing back at me. He looks as if he were asking me a question.

<div class="line_en">"It has been hard to be a princess today, Melchisedec," she said. "It has been harder than usual. It gets harder as the weather grows colder and the streets get more sloppy. When Lavinia laughed at my muddy skirt as I passed her in the hall, I thought of something to say all in a flash -- and I only just stopped myself in time. You can't sneer back at people like that -- if you are a princess. But you have to bite your tongue to hold yourself in. I bit mine. It was a cold afternoon, Melchisedec. And it's a cold night."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“如今做公主可很难啊，梅基塞代克，”她说。“比平常更难了。随着天气变得越冷，街道越泥泞，就越困难。我在大厅里经过拉维尼娅身边时，她讥笑我那泥污的裙子，这时我一闪念想说点什么——但总算及时忍住了。你可不能像那样用嘲笑去回敬人们——如果你是公主的话。可你不得不咬住了舌头来克制自己。我咬住了我的舌头。今天下午就很冷，梅基塞代克，又是个很冷的夜晚。”">查看中文翻译</div>
