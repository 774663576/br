<div class="line_en">For three weeks, Mike and I reported to Mrs. Martin and worked our three hours. By noon, our work was over, and she dropped three little dimes in each of our hands. Now, even at the age of 9 in the mid-1950s, 30 cents was not too exciting. Comic books cost 10 cents back then, so I usually spent my money on comic books and went home.</div>

Others get angry and push back. But they push back against their boss, or their job, or their husband or wife. They do not know it's life that's pushing."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但富爸爸仍在说：“假如你弄懂了生活这门大课，做任何事情你都会游刃有余。但就算你学不会，生活照样会推着你转。所以生活中，人们通常会做两件事。一些人在生活推着他转的同时，抓住生活赐予的每个机会；而另一些人则听任生活的摆布，不去与生活抗争。他们埋怨生活的不公平，因此就去讨厌老板，讨厌工作，讨厌家人，他们不知道生活也赐予了他们机会。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That's how they teach you in school," he said smiling. "But that is not how life teaches you, and I would say that life is the best teacher of all. Most of the time, life does not talk to you. It just sort of pushes you around. Each push is life saying, `Wake up. There's something I want you to learn.'"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那是学校教你们的法子，”他笑着说，“但生活可不是这样的教法。你知道吗，生活才是最好的老师，大多数时候，生活并不对你说些什么，它只是推着你转，每一次推，它都像是在说‘喂，醒一醒，有些东西我想让你学学”’。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“生活推着我们所有的人，有些人放弃了，有些人在抗争。学会了这一课的少数人会进步，他们欢迎生活来积极地推动他们，对他们来说，这种推动意味着他们又可以去学习一些新的东西，然后再进步。当然，大多数人还是放弃了，一部分人像你一样还在抗争。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Rich dad continued. "Or if you're the kind of person who has no guts, you just give up every time life pushes you. If you're that kind of person, you'll live all your life playing it safe, doing the right things, saving yourself for some event that never happens. Then, you die a boring old man. You'll have lots of friends who really like you because you were such a nice hard-working guy. You spent a life playing it safe, doing the right things. But the truth is, you let life push you into submission. Deep down you were terrified of taking risks. You really wanted to win, but the fear of losing was greater than the excitement of winning. Deep inside, you and only you will know you didn't go for it. You chose to play it safe."</div>
