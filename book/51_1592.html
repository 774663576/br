<div class="line_en">Muttations. No question about it. I've never seen these mutts, but they're no natural-born animals. They resemble huge wolves, but what wolf lands and then balances easily on its hind legs? What wolf waves the rest of the pack forward with its front paw as though it had a wrist? These things I can see at a distance. Up close, I'm sure their more menacing attributes will be revealed.</div>

<div class="line_en">Cato has made a beeline for the Cornucopia, and without question I follow him. If he thinks it's the safest place, who am I to argue? Besides, even if I could make it to the trees, it would be impossible for Peeta to outrun them on that leg -- Peeta! My hands have just landed on the metal at the pointed tail of the Cornucopia when I remember I'm part of a team. He's about fifteen yards behind me, hobbling as fast as he can, but the mutts are closing in on him fast. I send an arrow into the pack and one goes down, but there are plenty to take its place.</div>

<div class="line_en">He's right. I can't protect either of us on the ground. I start climbing, scaling the Cornucopia on my hands and feet. The pure gold surface has been designed to resemble the woven horn that we fill at harvest, so there are little ridges and seams to get a decent hold on. But after a day in the arena sun, the metal feels hot enough to blister my hands.</div>

<div class="line_en">Cato lies on his side at the very top of the horn, twenty feet above the ground, gasping to catch his breath as he gags over the edge. Now's my chance to finish him off. I stop midway up the horn and load another arrow, but just as I'm about to let it fly, I hear Peeta cry out. I twist around and see he's just reached the tail, and the mutts are right on his heels.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="加图侧身卧在宙斯之角的最顶端，那里离地足有二十英尺高。一边在宙斯之角的边缘呕吐，一边喘着粗气。现在到了我结果他的时候了。我爬到一半停下来，搭上箭，正准备射击，这时听到皮塔的喊叫声。我扭过身，看到他正跑到宙斯之角的尾部，野狗就在他身后。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Climb!" I yell. Peeta starts up hampered by not only the leg but the knife in his hand. I shoot my arrow down the throat of the first mutt that places its paws on the metal. As it dies the creature lashes out, inadvertently opening gashes on a few of its companions. That's when I get a look at the claws. Four inches and clearly razor-sharp.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“往上爬！”我大叫。牵制皮塔的不仅是他的腿，还有他手里的刀。第一只野狗的爪子已经搭到宙斯之角的金属壳上，我一箭射中它的喉咙，它扭动着身子死去，同时，尸体砸向后边的野狗，撞得它们向后略退了一步。这时我看到野狗的爪子，足有四英寸长，尖利无比。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Peeta reaches my feet and I grab his arm and pull him along. Then I remember Cato waiting at the top and whip around, but he's doubled over with cramps and apparently more preoccupied with the mutts than us. He coughs out something unintelligible. The snuffling, growling sound coming from the mutts isn't helping.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮塔抓住我的脚，我拉住他的胳膊把他拽上来。这时我想起顶部的加图，他正不安地来回移动，身体不停地抽搐，显然对于野狗的恐惧远大于对我们的担心。他嘴里喊着什么，我听不清楚，狗在汪汪地叫着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"What?" I shout at him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“什么？”我冲他喊道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The mutts are beginning to assemble. As they join together, they raise up again to stand easily on their back legs giving them an eerily human quality. Each has a thick coat, some with fur that is straight and sleek, others curly, and the colors vary from jet black to what I can only describe as blond. There's something else about them, something that makes the hair rise up on the back of my neck, but I can't put my finger on it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="野狗越聚越多，它们都用后腿站立，与人极为相似。每只狗身上都有厚厚的毛，有的笔直，有的卷曲，眼睛从深黑到金黄色不等。这些野狗有种让人说不出的感觉，令人汗毛倒立。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He said, 'Can they climb it?'" answers Peeta, drawing my focus back to the base of the horn.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他说，‘它们会爬上来吗？”’皮塔说，我的注意力又被拉回到宙斯之角的低端。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They put their snouts on the horn, sniffing and tasting the metal, scraping paws over the surface and then making high-pitched yipping sounds to one another. This must be how they communicate because the pack backs up as if to make room. Then one of them, a good-size mutt with silky waves of blond fur takes a running start and leaps onto the horn. Its back legs must be incredibly powerful because it lands a mere ten feet below us, its pink lips pulled back in a snarl. For a moment it hangs there, and in that moment I realize what else unsettled me about the mutts. The green eyes glowering at me are unlike any dog or wolf, any canine I've ever seen. They are unmistakably human. And that revelation has barely registered when I notice the collar with the number 1 inlaid with jewels and the whole horrible thing hits me. The blonde hair, the green eyes, the number… it's Glimmer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="野狗用嘴在宙斯之角的金属壳上又闻又啃，爪子不停地抓挠金属表面，随后彼此之间发出尖厉的叫声。这一定是它们互相交流的方式，尖叫声过后，狗群向后撤退，让出一定空间，接着，一只有光滑金色毛发的大个野狗从远处跑过来，一下子跃上了宙斯之角，它的后腿一定非常有力，它距我们十英尺远，又发出咆哮，粉红嘴唇向后张开。有一会儿，它待在那儿不动了，就在此时，我找到了野狗令我毛骨悚然的原因。野狗灼灼的目光与任何狗或狼都不同，我见过的所有犬科动物都没有这样的眼睛，那是人类的眼睛。当我看到狗项圈上用宝石镶嵌的号码“一”时，我的恐惧得到进一步证实。黄头发、绿眼睛、号码…是格丽默。">查看中文翻译</div>

Waiting to see if the creatures can, in fact, climb. But now, even though the mutt has begun to slide backward, unable to find any purchase on the metal, even though I can hear the slow screeching of the claws like nails on a blackboard, I fire into its throat. Its body twitches and flops onto the ground with a thud.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我惊恐地发出尖叫，手里的弓箭也差点滑落。我一直等待合适时机射击，因为箭袋里只有两支箭了。我等着，想看看那些生物能否爬上来。此时，那只野狗抓不住光滑的金属面，开始向下滑，尖爪发出像指甲抓黑板似的刺耳声音。我一箭射向它的喉咙，野狗扭动身体，砰的一声摔到地面。">查看中文翻译</div>

They've split into two groups at the sides of the horn and are using those powerful hindquarters to launch themselves at us. A pair of teeth ring together just inches from my hand and then I hear Peeta cry out, feel the yank on his body, the heavy weight of boy and mutt pulling me over the side.

<div class="line_en">"Kill it, Peeta! Kill it!" I'm shouting, and although I can't quite see what's happening, I know he must have stabbed the thing because the pull lessens. I'm able to haul him back onto the horn where we drag ourselves toward the top where the lesser of two evils awaits.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“杀死它，皮塔！杀死它！”我大喊。尽管我看不见，可我知道皮塔肯定刺到了野狗，因为向下拉的力量变小了。我重新把他拉上来，接着我们朝顶端爬去，在那里等待着的是我们的另一个邪恶的敌人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Cato stands before me, almost at the lip of the horn, holding Peeta in some kind of headlock, cutting off his air. Peeta's clawing at Cato's arm, but weakly, as if confused over whether it's more important to breathe or try and stem the gush of blood from the gaping hole a mutt left in his calf.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时我看到加图站在宙斯之角边缘之处，就在我面前，把皮塔的头夹在他腋下，掐得他喘不上气来。皮塔拼命抓挠加图的胳膊，却颓然无力。皮塔惊恐不安，不知该先挣脱加图，还是堵住被狗咬伤后汩汩流血的小腿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Cato has still not regained his feet, but his breathing is slowing and I know soon he'll be recovered enough to come for us, to hurl us over the side to our deaths. I arm my bow, but the arrow ends up taking out a mutt that can only be Thresh. Who else could jump so high? I feel a moment's relief because we must finally be up above the mutt line and I'm just turning back to face Cato when Peeta's jerked from my side. I'm sure the pack has got him until his blood splatters my face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="加图还没有站起来，他的呼吸仍很虚弱，我知道他很快就会恢复，朝我们扑来，将我们置于死地。我搭上箭，但却射向我们身后一只猛扑过来的野狗。这只肯定是萨里什，除了他，谁能跳得这么高？这时我们已经爬到野狗够不着的地方，我松了口气。我刚要扭头去对付加图，皮塔却被一把从我身旁拉走，血溅了我一脸，我想这回他肯定让野狗给咬住了。">查看中文翻译</div>

He can't kill Peeta without guaranteeing an arrow in his brain. We stand like statues, both of us seeking an out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="是啊，如果我射中加图，他会掉到野狗群中，皮塔也必死无疑。我们一时僵在那里。我射中加图就会杀死皮塔，他杀了皮塔，自己也会挨上一箭。我们像雕塑一样站着没动，两个人都在想着应对的计策。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I aim one of my last two arrows at Cato's head, knowing it'll have no effect on his trunk or limbs, which I can now see are clothed in a skintight, flesh-colored mesh.

<div class="line_en">As if in a last-ditch effort, Peeta raises his fingers, dripping with blood from his leg, up to Cato's arm. Instead of trying to wrestle his way free, his forefinger veers off and makes a deliberate X on the back of Cato's hand. Cato realizes what it means exactly one second after I do. I can tell by the way the smile drops from his lips. But it's one second too late because, by that time, my arrow is piercing his hand. He cries out and reflexively releases Peeta who slams back against him. For a horrible moment, I think they're both going over. I dive forward just catching hold of Peeta as Cato loses his footing on the blood-slick horn and plummets to the ground.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这危急时刻，皮塔用尽最后的力气，把手举向加图的手臂。他没有试图挣脱加图，而是在加图手背上故意做了一个“x”记号。加图明白了这记号的意思，但已经晚了。我看到那微笑从他脸上消失，箭应声射中他的手背。他大叫一声，松开皮塔，皮塔反身向他扑去。在那可怕的瞬间，我以为两个人会一块掉下去。我一个箭步冲上去抓住了皮塔，金属壳满是血迹，加图脚下一滑，向地面直栽下去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I don't watch, but I can hear the snarls, the growls, the howls of pain from both human and beast as Cato takes on the mutt pack. I can't understand how he can be surviving until I remember the body armor protecting him from ankle to neck and I realize what a long night this could be. Cato must have a knife or sword or something, too, something he had hidden in his clothes, because on occasion there's the death scream of a mutt or the sound of metal on metal as the blade collides with the golden horn. The combat moves around the side of the Cornucopia, and I know Cato must be attempting the one maneuver that could save his life -- to make his way back around to the tail of the horn and rejoin us. But in the end, despite his remarkable strength and skill, he is simply overpowered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我不愿看。我能听到犬吠、人吼，人、狗受伤发出的惨叫。我不明白为什么加图还没死，直至我突然记起了他穿的铠甲。铠甲可以从脖颈到脚踝对他进行保护。我意识到我们还要经历一个漫漫长夜。加图肯定有刀或剑，藏在衣服里。时不时能听到野狗垂死的吼叫，刀刃碰到宙斯之角时发出的金属撞击声。打斗声传到宙斯之角的侧面。我知道加图要孤注一掷，要回到宙斯之角尾部，重新找到我们，并进行最后的厮杀。但终于，尽管他身高力大、善于角斗，还是野狗占了上风。">查看中文翻译</div>

Peeta and I hold on to each other, waiting for the cannon, waiting for the competition to finish, waiting to be released. But it doesn't happen. Not yet. Because this is the climax of the Hunger Games, and the audience expects a show.</div>

<div class="line_en">I turn my attention to Peeta and discover his leg is bleeding as badly as ever. All our supplies, our packs, remain down by the lake where we abandoned them when we fled from the mutts. I have no bandage, nothing to staunch the flow of blood from his calf. Although I'm shaking in the biting wind, I rip off my jacket, remove my shirt, and zip back into the jacket as swiftly as possible. That brief exposure sets my teeth chattering beyond control.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我的注意力转到皮塔身上，他的腿流血不止。我们所有的装备在逃避野狗的追赶时，都留在了湖边。我没有绷带，无法止住从他小腿涌出的鲜血。虽然寒风冻得我瑟瑟发抖，我还是脱下夹克和衬衫，然后穿好夹克。就脱了一下衣服，已冻得牙齿打颤。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Night falls and the anthem plays and there's no picture of Cato in the sky, only the faint moans coming through the metal beneath us. The icy air blowing across the plain reminds me that the Games are not over and may not be for who knows how long, and there is still no guarantee of victory.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="夜幕降临，国歌响起，但没有加图的影像，我们身下的金属壳里发出低低的呻吟声。一阵冰冷的风刮过，提醒我饥饿游戏还没有结束，天知道还要持续多久，仍然看不到胜利的曙光。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Peeta's face is gray in the pale moonlight. I make him lie down before I probe his wound. Warm, slippery blood runs over my fingers. A bandage will not be enough. I've seen my mother tie a tourniquet a handful of times and try to replicate it. I cut free a sleeve from my shirt, wrap it twice around his leg just under his knee, and tie a half knot. I don't have a stick, so I take my remaining arrow and insert it in the knot, twisting it as tightly at I dare. It's risky business -- Peeta may end up losing his leg -- but when I weigh this against him losing his life, what alternative do I have? I bandage the wound in the rest of my shirt and lie down with him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在月光下，皮塔脸色苍白，我让他躺下，然后检查他的伤口。暖暖的、湿滑的血沾了我一手。光用绷带止血根本不行。有几次，我看妈妈用过止血带，也学着她的样子给皮塔止血。我撕开衬衫的一只袖子，在他膝盖以下缠两圈，系上活扣。我没有木棍，所以我把最后一支箭插到活扣里，尽可能绑紧。这很冒险——皮塔也许会失去一条腿——可与丢掉性命相比，我还有别的选择吗？我用衬衫把他的伤口裹好，然后躺在他身边。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I don't know how long it has been, maybe an hour or so, when Cato hits the ground and we hear the mutts dragging him, dragging him back into the Cornucopia. Now they'll finish him off, I think. But there's still no cannon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从加图一头栽下去到现在，不知过了多久，大约一小时吧。此时我们听到野狗拖拽他的声音，把他拖到宙斯之角里面。“这回，它们该把他结果了。”我暗忖但，仍然没有炮声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Are you cold?" he asks. He unzips his jacket and I press against him as he fastens it around me. It's a bit warmer, sharing our body heat inside my double layer of jackets, but the night is young. The temperature will continue to drop. Even now I can feel the Cornucopia, which burned so when I first climbed it, slowly turning to ice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你冷吗？”他问。他拉开拉链，把我裹到他的衣服里。这样暖和些，我被裹在两层夹克里，又能彼此温暖，感觉稍暖和点。可夜还长，温度在持续下降。白天我刚往上爬时烫人的宙斯之角，现在已慢慢变得冰凉了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Don't go to sleep," I tell him. I'm not sure if this is exactly medical protocol, but I'm terrified that if he drifts off he'll never wake again.</div>

<div class="line_en">The next hours are the worst in my life, which if you think about it, is saying something. The cold would be torture enough, but the real nightmare is listening to Cato, moaning, begging, and finally just whimpering as the mutts work away at him. After a very short time, I don't care who he is or what he's done, all I want is for his suffering to end.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="下面的几个小时是我一生中最难熬的时光。寒冷已使人痛苦万分，真正的噩梦是听加图的呻吟、哀求，最后是野狗折磨他时的哭诉。过了不多会儿，我觉得自己已不在乎他是谁，做了什么，我想要的一切就是尽快结束他的痛苦。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It goes on and on and on and eventually completely consumes my mind, blocking out memories and hopes of tomorrow, erasing everything but the present, which I begin to believe will never change. There will never be anything but cold and fear and the agonized sounds of the boy dying in the horn.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这种痛苦一直持续着，没有丝毫间断，让我精神备受折磨，我不再想明天、不再想希望、不再有过去，抹去了一切记忆，充满大脑的只有现在，我觉得它似乎再也不会改变，一切的一切只有寒冷、恐惧和那个快死的男孩的哀嚎。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Peeta begins to doze off now, and each time he does, I find myself yelling his name louder and louder because if he goes and dies on me now, I know I'll go completely insane. He's fighting it, probably more for me than for him, and it's hard because unconsciousness would be its own form of escape. But the adrenaline pumping through my body would never allow me to follow him, so I can't let him go. I just can't.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮塔开始迷迷糊糊地要睡去。我一次一次大声喊着他的名字，因为如果他死在我身边，我会完全发疯。他也在努力坚持着，与其说为了他自己，倒不如说更多的是为我。这很艰难，因为失去意识就脱离了这所有的痛苦。可我体内的肾上腺素绝不允许我跟他走，所以我也不让他走。我不能！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The only indication of the passage of time lies in the heavens, the subtle shift of the moon. So Peeta begins pointing it out to me, insisting I acknowledge its progress and sometimes, for just a moment I feel a flicker of hope before the agony of the night engulfs me again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="唯有月亮，这高挂在天际、缓慢移动的星体证明时间是流动的。皮塔对我说黑夜会过去，因为月亮在动；有时，我似乎看到了一丝希望，可很快又被寒冷的黑夜吞噬。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Finally, I hear him whisper that the sun is rising. I open my eyes and find the stars fading in the pale light of dawn. I can see, too, how bloodless Peeta's face has become. How little time he has left. And I know I have to get him back to the Capitol.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="终于，我听到他小声说太阳要升起来了。我睁开眼，看到星光在晨曦中逐渐淡去。我也看到皮塔的脸是多么的苍白。他剩下的时间已经不多了。我知道我要把他送回凯匹特。">查看中文翻译</div>
