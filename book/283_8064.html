<div class="line_en">Frank Churchill seemed to have been on the watch; and though he did not say much, his eyes declared that he meant to have a delightful evening. They all walked about together, to see that every thing was as it should be; and within a few minutes were joined by the contents of another carriage, which Emma could not hear the sound of at first, without great surprize. "So unreasonably early!" she was going to exclaim; but she presently found that it was a family of old friends, who were coming, like herself, by particular desire, to help Mr. Weston's judgment; and they were so very closely followed by another carriage of cousins, who had been entreated to come early with the same distinguishing earnestness, on the same errand, that it seemed as if half the company might soon be collected together for the purpose of preparatory inspection.</div>

<div class="line_en">No second meeting had there yet been between him and Emma. The room at the Crown was to witness it; -- but it would be better than a common meeting in a crowd. Mr. Weston had been so very earnest in his entreaties for her arriving there as soon as possible after themselves, for the purpose of taking her opinion as to the propriety and comfort of the rooms before any other persons came, that she could not refuse him, and must therefore spend some quiet interval in the young man's company. She was to convey Harriet, and they drove to the Crown in good time, the Randalls party just sufficiently before them.</div>

<div class="line_en">Emma perceived that her taste was not the only taste on which Mr. Weston depended, and felt, that to be the favourite and intimate of a man who had so many intimates and confidantes, was not the very first distinction in the scale of vanity. She liked his open manners, but a little less of open-heartedness would have made him a higher character. -- General benevolence, but not general friendship, made a man what he ought to be. -- She could fancy such a man. The whole party walked about, and looked, and praised again; and then, having nothing else to do, formed a sort of half-circle round the fire, to observe in their various modes, till other subjects were started, that, though May, a fire in the evening was still very pleasant.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱玛意识到，韦斯顿先生并非只相信她一个人的鉴赏力，觉得作为一个有这么多好友和知己的人的好友和知己，并不是最光荣的事。她喜欢他的坦率，但他若是略微少坦率一点，品格就会更高尚一些。普遍与人为善，而不是普遍与人为友，他应该是这样一个人。她就喜欢这样的人。大家走走看看，还要夸奖一番。后来没事可做了，就在壁炉跟前围成半个圆圈，以各自的口吻说，尽避已是五月了，晚上生个火还是很舒适的，直说到扯起别的话题为止。">查看中文翻译</div>

You know I candidly told you I should form my own opinion; and I am happy to say that I am extremely pleased with him. -- You may believe me. I never compliment. I think him a very handsome young man, and his manners are precisely what I like and approve-so truly the gentleman, without the least conceit or puppyism. You must know I have a vast dislike to puppies -- quite a horror of them. They were never tolerated at Maple Grove.

Her gestures and movements might be understood by any one who looked on like Emma; but her words, every body's words, were soon lost under the incessant flow of Miss Bates, who came in talking, and had not finished her speech under many minutes after her being admitted into the circle at the fire.

And Jane declares -- Well! --(as soon as she was within the door) Well! This is brilliant indeed! -- This is admirable! -- Excellently contrived, upon my word. Nothing wanting. Could not have imagined it. -- So well lighted up! -- Jane, Jane, look! -- did you ever see any thing? Oh! Mr. Weston, you must really have had Aladdin's lamp. Good Mrs. Stokes would not know her own room again. I saw her as I came in; she was standing in the entrance. `Oh! Mrs. Stokes,' said I -- but I had not time for more." She was now met by Mrs. Weston. -- "Very well, I thank you, ma'am. I hope you are quite well. Very happy to hear it. So afraid you might have a headach! -- seeing you pass by so often, and knowing how much trouble you must have. Delighted to hear it indeed. Ah! dear Mrs. Elton, so obliged to you for the carriage! -- excellent time. Jane and I quite ready. Did not keep the horses a moment. Most comfortable carriage. -- Oh! and I am sure our thanks are due to you, Mrs. Weston, on that score. Mrs. Elton had most kindly sent Jane a note, or we should have been. -- But two such offers in one day! -- Never were such neighbours. I said to my mother, `Upon my word, ma'am --.' Thank you, my mother is remarkably well. Gone to Mr. Woodhouse's. I made her take her shawl-for the evenings are not warm-her large new shawl -- Mrs. Dixon's wedding-present. -- So kind of her to think of my mother! Bought at Weymouth, you know-Mr. Dixon's choice. There were three others, Jane says, which they hesitated about some time. Colonel Campbell rather preferred an olive. My dear Jane, are you sure you did not wet your feet? -- It was but a drop or two, but I am so afraid: -- but Mr. Frank Churchill was so extremely -- and there was a mat to step upon-I shall never forget his extreme politeness. -- Oh! Mr. Frank Churchill, I must tell you my mother's spectacles have never been in fault since; the rivet never came out again. My mother often talks of your good-nature. Does not she, Jane? -- Do not we often talk of Mr. Frank Churchill? -- Ah! here's Miss Woodhouse. -- Dear Miss Woodhouse, how do you do? -- Very well I thank you, quite well. This is meeting quite in fairy-land! -- Such a transformation! -- Must not compliment, I know (eyeing Emma most complacently) -- that would be rude-but upon my word, Miss Woodhouse, you do look-how do you like Jane's hair? -- You are a judge. -- She did it all herself. Quite wonderful how she does her hair! -- No hairdresser from London I think could. -- Ah! Dr. Hughes I declare -- and Mrs. Hughes. Must go and speak to Dr. and Mrs. Hughes for a moment. -- How do you do? How do you do? -- Very well, I thank you. This is delightful, is not it? -- Where's dear Mr. Richard? -- Oh! there he is. Don't disturb him. Much better employed talking to the young ladies. How do you do, Mr. Richard? -- I saw you the other day as you rode through the town-Mrs. Otway, I protest! -- and good Mr. Otway, and Miss Otway and Miss Caroline. -- Such a host of friends! -- and Mr. George and Mr. Arthur! -- How do you do? How do you all do? -- Quite well, I am much obliged to you. Never better. -- Don't I hear another carriage? -- Who can this be? -- very likely the worthy Coles. -- Upon my word, this is charming to be standing about among such friends! And such a noble fire! -- I am quite roasted. No coffee, I thank you, for me-never take coffee. -- A little tea if you please, sir, by and bye, -- no hurry-Oh! here it comes.

Whether he were overhearing too, she could not determine. After a good many compliments to Jane on her dress and look, compliments very quietly and properly taken, Mrs. Elton was evidently wanting to be complimented herself -- and it was, "How do you like my gown? -- How do you like my trimming? -- How has Wright done my hair?" -- with many other relative questions, all answered with patient politeness. Mrs. Elton then said, "Nobody can think less of dress in general than I do-but upon such an occasion as this, when every body's eyes are so much upon me, and in compliment to the Westons-who I have no doubt are giving this ball chiefly to do me honour-I would not wish to be inferior to others.

<div class="line_en">Frank turned instantly to Emma, to claim her former promise; and boasted himself an engaged man, which his father looked his most perfect approbation of-and it then appeared that Mrs. Weston was wanting him to dance with Mrs. Elton himself, and that their business was to help to persuade him into it, which was done pretty soon. -- Mr. Weston and Mrs. Elton led the way, Mr. Frank Churchill and Miss Woodhouse followed. Emma must submit to stand second to Mrs. Elton, though she had always considered the ball as peculiarly for her. It was almost enough to make her think of marrying. Mrs. Elton had undoubtedly the advantage, at this time, in vanity completely gratified; for though she had intended to begin with Frank Churchill, she could not lose by the change. Mr. Weston might be his son's superior. -- In spite of this little rub, however, Emma was smiling with enjoyment, delighted to see the respectable length of the set as it was forming, and to feel that she had so many hours of unusual festivity before her. -- She was more disturbed by Mr. Knightley's not dancing than by any thing else. -- There he was, among the standers-by, where he ought not to be; he ought to be dancing, -- not classing himself with the husbands, and fathers, and whist-players, who were pretending to feel an interest in the dance till their rubbers were made up, -- so young as he looked! -- He could not have appeared to greater advantage perhaps anywhere, than where he had placed himself. His tall, firm, upright figure, among the bulky forms and stooping shoulders of the elderly men, was such as Emma felt must draw every body's eyes; and, excepting her own partner, there was not one among the whole row of young men who could be compared with him. -- He moved a few steps nearer, and those few steps were enough to prove in how gentlemanlike a manner, with what natural grace, he must have danced, would he but take the trouble. -- Whenever she caught his eye, she forced him to smile; but in general he was looking grave. She wished he could love a ballroom better, and could like Frank Churchill better. -- He seemed often observing her. She must not flatter herself that he thought of her dancing, but if he were criticising her behaviour, she did not feel afraid. There was nothing like flirtation between her and her partner. They seemed more like cheerful, easy friends, than lovers. That Frank Churchill thought less of her than he had done, was indubitable.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弗兰克赶忙转向爱玛，要她履行以前的诺言。他声称他已有约在先，他父亲露出一副称心如意的神情——这时候，韦斯顿太太似乎就要这位父亲亲自跟埃尔顿太太跳舞，于是他们两个便帮着劝说，那做父亲的很快就被服了。韦斯顿先生与埃尔顿太太领头，弗兰克·邱吉尔先生与伍德豪斯小姐跟在后面。爱玛虽然一直认为这次舞会是特地为她举行的，但现在不得不屈居埃尔顿太太之后。这样一来，她几乎想要结婚了。这一次，埃尔顿太太无疑占了上风，虚荣心得到了尽情的满足。虽说她原想先跟弗兰克·邱吉尔跳，但是换了个舞伴并无什么损失。韦斯顿先生也许比他儿子强。爱玛尽避受了点小小的挫折，但是看到跳舞的人排成长得可观的舞队，而且觉得可以非同寻常地快活几个小时，不禁十分高兴，喜笑颜开。而最使她感觉不安的是，奈特利先生没有跳舞。他就站在旁观者当中；其实，他不应该待在那儿，而应该跳舞——不该去跟那些做丈夫的、做父亲的和打惠斯特牌的人混在一起，尽避那几个人在打牌以前还装出对跳舞很感兴趣的样子。奈特利先生看上去有多年轻啊！他待在那伙人中间，也许比待在任何别的地方都显得更出众。他高高的个子，长得又结实又挺拔，待在那些身宽体胖、弯腰曲背的上了年纪的人中间，爱玛觉得准能为人人所瞩目。在那一长列年轻人中，除了她自己的舞伴以外，谁也没法跟他比。他往前走了几步，可这几步就足以表明，只要他肯尽心跳舞的话，跳起来一定很有绅士风度，而且显现出与生俱来的优雅。爱玛每次触到他的目光，总能引得他嫣然一笑。不过，总的说来，他的神情比较严肃。爱玛希望他能对舞厅喜欢一点，也能对弗兰克·邱吉尔喜欢一点。他似乎常常在注视她。她不能自鸣得意地认为他在琢磨她的跳舞，不过他若是在责怪她的行为，她也不害怕。她和她的舞伴之间没有任何轻佻的举动。他们俩不像是情人，而像是快活、融洽的朋友。弗兰克·邱吉尔不像以前那样思恋她，这是毋庸置疑的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The ball proceeded pleasantly. The anxious cares, the incessant attentions of Mrs. Weston, were not thrown away. Every body seemed happy; and the praise of being a delightful ball, which is seldom bestowed till after a ball has ceased to be, was repeatedly given in the very beginning of the existence of this. Of very important, very recordable events, it was not more productive than such meetings usually are. There was one, however, which Emma thought something of. -- The two last dances before supper were begun, and Harriet had no partner; -- the only young lady sitting down; -- and so equal had been hitherto the number of dancers, that how there could be any one disengaged was the wonder! -- But Emma's wonder lessened soon afterwards, on seeing Mr. Elton sauntering about. He would not ask Harriet to dance if it were possible to be avoided: she was sure he would not-and she was expecting him every moment to escape into the card-room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="舞会欢快地进行着。韦斯顿太太费尽心机，不断张罗，终于没有白费，看来人人都很快活。本来舞会不结束难得会有人说好的，但这次从一开始，大家就一再夸奖这是一场令人愉快的舞会。跟平常的舞会比起来，这次舞会也没出现更多重要的、值得记载的事情。不过，有一件事爱玛比较看重。宴会前的最后两曲舞开始了，哈丽特却没有舞伴，年轻小姐中只有她一人干坐着。迄今为止，跳舞的人一直是男女人数相等，要找到一个闲着的人那才怪呢！但是，一看见埃尔顿先生在悠闲地走来走去，爱玛也就不那么见怪了。只要能避免，他是不会邀请哈丽特跳舞的。爱玛知道他不会——她料想他随时都会溜进牌室里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Escape, however, was not his plan. He came to the part of the room where the sitters-by were collected, spoke to some, and walked about in front of them, as if to shew his liberty, and his resolution of maintaining it. He did not omit being sometimes directly before Miss Smith, or speaking to those who were close to her. -- Emma saw it. She was not yet dancing; she was working her way up from the bottom, and had therefore leisure to look around, and by only turning her head a little she saw it all. When she was half-way up the set, the whole group were exactly behind her, and she would no longer allow her eyes to watch; but Mr. Elton was so near, that she heard every syllable of a dialogue which just then took place between him and Mrs. Weston; and she perceived that his wife, who was standing immediately above her, was not only listening also, but even encouraging him by significant glances. -- The kind-hearted, gentle Mrs. Weston had left her seat to join him and say, "Do not you dance, Mr. Elton?" to which his prompt reply was, "Most readily, Mrs. Weston, if you will dance with me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而他并不想溜，却来到看热闹人多的地方，跟这个说说话，在那个面前走走，仿佛要显显他的自由自在，而且决心自由自在下去。他有时候难免走到史密斯小姐跟前，或者跟她身边的人聊上几句。爱玛都看见了。她还没有跳舞，正从舞队的末尾往前走，因此有空四下张望，只把头稍微一转，就能把一切全都看在眼里。她走到舞队当中的地方，那伙人恰好都在她后面，她也就不再去张望了。不过埃尔顿先生离她很近，他和韦斯顿太太之间的谈话，她一字一句都听得清清楚楚。她还发现，就在她前面的埃尔顿太太这时不仅也在听，而且还在使眼色鼓励丈夫。心地善良、和蔼可亲的韦斯顿太太已离开座位，到埃尔顿先生跟前，说：“埃尔顿先生，你不跳舞吗？”埃尔顿先生赶忙回答说：“韦斯顿太太，如果你肯跟我跳，我很乐意奉陪。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Excellent dancing indeed! -- Yes, my dear, I ran home, as I said I should, to help grandmama to bed, and got back again, and nobody missed me. -- I set off without saying a word, just as I told you. Grandmama was quite well, had a charming evening with Mr. Woodhouse, a vast deal of chat, and backgammon. -- Tea was made downstairs, biscuits and baked apples and wine before she came away: amazing luck in some of her throws: and she inquired a great deal about you, how you were amused, and who were your partners. `Oh!' said I, `I shall not forestall Jane; I left her dancing with Mr. George Otway; she will love to tell you all about it herself to-morrow: her first partner was Mr. Elton, I do not know who will ask her next, perhaps Mr. William Cox.' My dear sir, you are too obliging. -- Is there nobody you would not rather? -- I am not helpless. Sir, you are most kind. Upon my word, Jane on one arm, and me on the other! -- Stop, stop, let us stand a little back, Mrs. Elton is going; dear Mrs. Elton, how elegant she looks! -- Beautiful lace! -- Now we all follow in her train.

I was convinced there were two, and there is but one. I never saw any thing equal to the comfort and style-Candles everywhere. -- I was telling you of your grandmama, Jane, -- There was a little disappointment. -- The baked apples and biscuits, excellent in their way, you know; but there was a delicate fricassee of sweetbread and some asparagus brought in at first, and good Mr. Woodhouse, not thinking the asparagus quite boiled enough, sent it all out again. Now there is nothing grandmama loves better than sweetbread and asparagus -- so she was rather disappointed, but we agreed we would not speak of it to any body, for fear of its getting round to dear Miss Woodhouse, who would be so very much concerned! -- Well, this is brilliant! I am all amazement! could not have supposed any thing! -- Such elegance and profusion! -- I have seen nothing like it since -- Well, where shall we sit? where shall we sit? Anywhere, so that Jane is not in a draught. Where I sit is of no consequence. Oh! do you recommend this side? -- Well, I am sure, Mr. Churchill -- only it seems too good-but just as you please.
