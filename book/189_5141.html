<div class="line_en">As it would be, by no means, seemly in a humble author to keep so mighty a personage as a beadle waiting, with his back to the fire, and the skirts of his coat gathered up under his arms, until such time as it might suit his pleasure to relieve him; and as it would still less become his station, or his gallantry to involve in the same neglect a lady on whom that beadle had looked with an eye of tenderness and affection, and in whose ear he had whispered sweet words, which, coming from such a quarter, might well thrill the bosom of maid or matron of whatsoever degree; the historian whose pen traces these words -- trusting that he knows his place, and that he entertains a becoming reverence for those upon earth to whom high and important authority is delegated -- hastens to pay them that respect which their position demands, and to treat them with all that duteous ceremony which their exalted rank, and (by consequence) great virtues, imperatively claim at his hands. Towards this end, indeed, he had purposed to introduce, in this place, a dissertation touching the divine right of beadles, and elucidative of the position, that a beadle can do no wrong: which could not fail to have been both pleasurable and profitable to the right-minded reader but which he is unfortunately compelled, by want of time and space, to postpone to some more convenient and fitting opportunity; on the arrival of which, he will be prepared to show, that a beadle properly constituted: that is to say, a parochial beadle, attached to a parochail workhouse, and attending in his official capacity the parochial church: is, in right and virtue of his office, possessed of all the excellences and best qualities of humanity; and that to none of those excellences, can mere companies" beadles, or court-of-law beadles, or even chapel-of-ease beadles (save the last, and they in a very lowly and inferior degree), lay the remotest sustainable claim.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr. Bumble had re-counted the teaspoons, re-weighed the sugar-tongs, made a closer inspection of the milk-pot, and ascertained to a nicety the exact condition of the furniture, down to the very horse-hair seats of the chairs; and had repeated each process full half a dozen times; before he began to think that it was time for Mrs. Corney to return. Thinking begets thinking; as there were no sounds of Mrs. Corney's approach, it occured to Mr. Bumble that it would be an innocent and virtuous way of spending the time, if he were further to allay his curiousity by a cursory glance at the interior of Mrs. Corney's chest of drawers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邦布尔先生把茶匙的数目重新点了一遍，又掂了掂方糖夹子，对奶锅作了一番更为周密的考察，对于家具的一应情形，乃至那几张马鬃椅垫，他都―一做到心中有数，这一程序又重复了六七次，他这才想起柯尼太太也该回来了。他一时思绪万千。柯尼太太归来的足音又老是听不见，邦布尔先生不禁想到，浏览一下柯尼太太的柜橱里的东西，以便进一步满足自己的好奇心，理当算是一种无伤大雅而又合乎道德的消遣方法。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Having listened at the keyhole, to assure himself that nobody was approaching the chamber, Mr. Bumble, beginning at the bottom, proceeded to make himself acquainted with the contents of the three long drawers: which, being filled with various garments of good fashion and texture, carefully preserved between two layers of old newspapers, speckled with dried lavender: seemed to yield him exceeding satisfaction. Arriving, in course of time, at the right-hand corner drawer (in which was the key), and beholding therein a small padlocked box, which, being shaken, gave forth a pleasant sound, as of the chinking of coin, Mr. Bumble returned with a stately walk to the fireplace; and, resuming his old attitude, said, with a grave and determined air, "I'll do it!" He followed up this remarkable declaration, by shaking his head in a waggish manner for ten minutes, as though he were remonstrating with himself for being such a pleasant dog; and then, he took a view of his legs in profile, with much seeming pleasure and interest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邦布尔先生贴近锁孔听了一下，确信没有人朝这间屋子走来，便从基层着手，了解三个长抽屉里的内容：里边装满了各式各样的衣物，样式和质地都很讲究马克思的著作，特别是早期著作的注释和说明，以区别以往，用两层旧报纸细心地保护起来，上边还点缀着熏衣草的干花，这一点似乎使他格外满意。他打开右边角落上的抽屉（钥匙就在里边），看见里边放着一个上了锁的小匣子，他摇了摇，匣子里发出一阵令人愉快的响声，好像是金币的丁当声。邦布尔先生步态庄重地回到壁炉前边，恢复了先前的姿势，神色严肃而果断地说道：“就这么办。”这一份意义重大的公告发布完毕，他怪模怪样地摇了十分钟脑袋，活像是在苦苦劝告自己当一只讨人喜欢的狗一样。随后他侧着身子，对自己的双腿左看右看，似乎非常开心，兴趣盎然。">查看中文翻译</div>

Uttering these words, the good lady pointed, distractedly, to the cupboard, and underwent a convulsion from internal spasms. Mr. Bumble rushed to the closet; and, snatching a pint green-glass bottle from the shelf thus incoherently indicated, filled a tea-cup with its contents, and held it to the lady's lips.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这不行啊。”柯尼太太回答，“我喝不――欧！在右边角落最上边一格――呃！”这位可敬的女士说罢，神思恍格地指了指食橱，发出一阵由于内心恐慌引起的抽筋。邦布尔先生向壁橱冲去，按照这一番上气不接下气的指示，从格板上抓起一只容量一品托的绿色玻璃瓶，将瓶中之物斟了满满一茶杯，递到这位女士唇边。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="随后的一两分钟里，双方什么话也没说，待到这段时间届满，邦布尔先生为了替这种观念配上插图，便将先前搭在柯尼太太椅背上的左臂移到柯尼太太的裙带上，逐渐围住了她的腰。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Now, Mr. and Mrs. Sowerberry having gone out to tea and supper: and Noah Claypole not being at any time disposed to take upon himself a greater amount of physical exertion than is necessary to a convenient performance of the two functions of eating and drinking, the shop was not closed, although it was past the usual hour of shutting-up. Mr. Bumble tapped with his cane on the counter several times; but, attracting no attention, and beholding a light shining through the glass-window of the little parlour at the back of the shop, he made bold to peep in and see what was going forward; and when he saw what was going forward, he was not a little surprised.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这功夫，苏尔伯雷先生和苏尔伯雷太大都上外边吃茶点晚餐去了。尽管已经过了平时打烊的时间，铺子却还没有关门，诺亚克雷波尔什么时候都无意承担过多的体力消耗，只在便于发挥吃喝这两种功能的时刻才有必要的动作。邦布尔先生用他的手杖在柜台上敲了几下，仍一点也没引起注意，他见后边小客厅的玻璃窗里透出一点亮光，便大胆往里边瞅了一眼，想瞧瞧里边在干什么。他看出个究竟之后，不觉大吃一惊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The dove then turned up his coat-collar, and put on his cocked hat; and, having exchanged a long and affectionate embrace with his future partner, once again braved the cold wind of the night: merely pausing, for a few minutes, in the male paupers" ward, to abuse them a little, with the view of satisfying himself that he could fill the office of workhouse-master with needful acerbity. Assured of his qualifications, Mr. Bumble left the building with a light heart, and bright visions of his future promotion: which served to occupy his mind until he reached the shop of the undertaker.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Here's a delicious fat one, Noah, dear!" said Charlotte; "try him, do; only this one."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这只肥的味道不错，诺亚，亲爱的。”夏洛蒂说道，“尝尝看，尝啊，就这一只。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What a delicious thing is a oyster!" remarked Mr. Claypole, after he had swallowed it. "What a pity it is, a number of "em should ever make you feel uncomfortable; isn't it, Charlotte?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“牡砺还真好吃。”克雷波尔先生咽下那只牡砺，评论道，“真可惜，吃不了几只就叫你觉得不舒服了，不是吗，夏洛蒂？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The cloth was laid for supper; the table was covered with bread and butter, plates and glasses; a porter-pot and a wine-bottle. At the upper end of the table, Mr. Noah Claypole lolled negligently in an easy-chair, with his legs thrown over one of the arms: an open clasp-knife in one hand, and a mass of buttered bread in the other. Close beside him stood Charlotte, opening oysters from a barrel: which Mr. Claypole condescended to swallow, with remarkable avidity. A more than ordinary redness in the region of the young gentleman's nose, and a kind of fixed wink in his right eye, denoted that he was in a slight degree intoxicated; these symptoms were confirmed by the intense relish with which he took his oysters, for which nothing but a strong appreciation of their cooling properties, in cases of internal fever, could have sufficiently accounted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="晚餐桌布已经铺好了，奶油、面包、碟子、酒杯，还有一罐黑啤酒、一瓶葡萄酒，摆了满满一桌。桌子上首，诺亚克雷波尔先生懒洋洋地靠在一把安乐椅里，双腿跷在扶手上，一只手握着一把张开的大折刀，另一只手拿着一大块涂满奶油的面包。夏洛蒂紧挨着站在他身边，正从一只桶里把牡砺拿出来剖开，克雷波尔先生也很平易近人，以一种相当可观的胃口将牡砺咽下去。这位年轻绅士的鼻子周围比平时还要红，右眼眨巴着老是盯住一个什么地方，意味着他已经略有几分醉意。他吞食牡砺时表现出的浓厚兴趣也证实了这一点，因为他只知道牡砺对于内火上升有一定清凉解热作用，别的东西都不足以说明这一点。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Silence!" cried Mr. Bumble, sternly. "Take yourself downstairs, ma'am. Noah, you shut up the shop; say another word till your master comes home, at your peril; and, when he does come home, tell him that Mr. Bumble said he was to send a old woman's shell after breakfast to-morrow morning. Do you hear sir? Kissing!" cried Mr. Bumble, holding up his hands. "The sin and wickedness of the lower orders in this porochial district is frightful! If Parliament don't take their abominable courses under consideration, this country's ruined, and the character of the peasantry gone for ever!" With these words, the beadle strode, with a lofty and gloomy air, from the undertaker's premises.</div>
