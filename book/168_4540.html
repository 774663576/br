<div class="line_en">The ground from here to the Wall was grasslands, Bran knew; fallow fields and low rolling hills, high meadows and lowland bogs. It would be much easier going than the mountains behind, but so much open space made Meera uneasy. "I feel naked," she confessed. "There's no place to hide."</div>

<div class="line_en">It was the first village they had seen since leaving the foothills. Meera had scouted ahead to make certain there was no one lurking amongst the ruins. Sliding in and amongst oaks and apple trees with her net and spear in hand, she startled three red deer and sent them bounding away through? the? rush. Summer saw the flash of motion and was after them at once. Bran watched the direwolf lope off, and for a moment wanted nothing so much as to slip his skin and run with him, but Meera was waving for them to come ahead. Reluctantly, he turned away from Summer and urged Hodor on, into the village. Jojen walked with them.</div>

When the wind blew, ripples moved across the surface of the lake, chasing one another like boys at play.

<div class="line_en">No one had lived in the village for long years, Bran could see. All the houses were falling down. Even the inn. It had never been much of an inn, to look at it, but now all that remained was a stone chimney and two cracked walls, set amongst a dozen apple trees. One was growing up through the common room, where a layer of wet brown leaves and rotting apples carpeted the floor. The air was thick with the smell of them, a cloying cidery scent that was almost overwhelming. Meera stabbed a few apples with her frog spear, trying to find some still good enough to eat, but they were all too brown and wormy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布兰看得出，村子已多年无人居住。所有房屋皆已倒塌，连客栈也不例外。它原本就不是个像样的客栈，而今只剩一根石烟囱和两道残墙，周围是十几棵苹果树。其中一棵从大厅里长出来，厅内地板铺着一层湿乎乎的棕叶和烂苹果，空中充满浓郁的气味，有些像酒，几乎掩盖了所有其他味道。梅拉用蛙矛戳起几个苹果，试图找到一些可以吃的，但没用，它们全成了棕褐色，内里长满蠕虫。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The Night's Watch," he answered. "This is the Gift. The New Gift, and north of that Brandon's Gift." Maester Luwin had taught him the history. "Brandon the Builder gave all the land south of the Wall to the black brothers, to a distance of twenty-five leagues. For their… for their sustenance and support." He was proud that he still remembered that part. "Some maesters say it was some other Brandon, not the Builder, but it's still Brandon's Gift. Thousands of years later, Good Queen Alysanne visited the Wall on her dragon Silverwing, and she thought the Night's Watch was so brave that she had the Old King double the size of their lands, to fifty leagues. So that was the New Gift." He waved a hand. "Here. All this."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“属于守夜人军团，”他回答。“这是‘新赠地’，位于‘布兰登的馈赠’以南。”鲁温学士教的历史派上了用场。“‘筑城者’布兰登将绝境长城南方二十五里格的土地全部送给黑衣弟兄，作为…作为维持生计的资源。”他很骄傲自己仍记得上的课。“有些学士争论说那是另一个布兰登，不是‘筑城者’，但反正那就叫‘布兰登的馈赠’。数千年后，善良的亚莉珊王后乘她的龙‘银翼’造访长城，敬佩于守夜人的勇敢，因此建议‘人瑞王’将土地翻倍，扩展至五十里格。这就是‘新赠地’。”他挥挥手。“这里。所有这些都是。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a peaceful spot, still and tranquil and lovely to behold, but Bran thought there was something sad about an empty inn, and Hodor seemed to feel it too. "Hodor? " he said in a confused sort of way. "Hodor? Hodor?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"This is good land." Jojen picked up a handful of dirt, rubbing it between his fingers. "A village, an inn, a stout holdfast in the lake, all these apple trees… but where are the people, Bran? Why would they leave such a place?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“多好的一片土地。”玖健抓起泥土，在指间揉搓，“有村子，有客栈，还有湖中的坚固要塞，苹果树…但人在哪儿，布兰？人们为何离开这样好的地方。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"They were afraid of the wildlings," said Bran. "Wildlings come over the Wall or through the mountains, to raid and steal and carry off women. If they catch you, they make your skull into a cup to drink blood, Old Nan used to say. The Night's Watch isn't so strong as it was in Brandon's day or Queen Alysanne's, so more get through. The places nearest the Wall got raided so much the smallfolk moved south, into the mountains or onto the Umber lands east of the kingsroad. The Greatjon's people get raided too, but not so much as the people who used to live in the Gift."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“因为野人，”布兰说。“野人们穿过长城或群山，前来抢劫偷盗，掳夺妇女。老奶妈说，若教他们逮住，头骨就会被做成饮血的杯子。而今守夜人的力量不如布兰登或亚莉珊王后的时代那样强，许多野人都能过来。靠近长城的地方常遭劫掠，因此百姓们往南迁移，进入群山中或国王大道以东的安柏家领地。大琼恩那儿也会遭受劫掠，但不若赠地里这么频繁。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"There's a causeway. A stone causeway, hidden under the water. We could walk out." They could, anyway; he would have to ride on Hodor's back, but at least he'd stay dry that way.</div>

<div class="line_en">Bran looked up at the sky. It had been a beautiful crisp clear autumn day, sunny and almost warm, but there were dark clouds off to the west now, that was true, and the wind seemed to be picking up. "There's no roof on the inn and only the two walls," he pointed out. "We should go out to the holdfast."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布兰抬头望向天空。这是个美丽的秋日，晴朗清爽，阳光充沛，几乎算得上温暖，但黎德说得没错，西方出现黑压压的云层，风也似乎渐渐增强。“这客栈没有屋顶，只有两面墙，”他指出，“我们还是去外面的塔楼要塞吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Path, steps, and door were in a straight line, which made you think the causeway ran straight, but that wasn't so. Under the lake it zigged and zagged, going a third of a way around the island before jagging back. The turns were treacherous, and the long path meant that anyone approaching would be exposed to arrow fire from the tower for a long time. The hidden stones were slimy and slippery too; twice Hodor almost lost his footing and shouted "HODOR!" in alarm before regaining his balance. The second time scared Bran badly. If Hodor fell into the lake with him in his basket, he could well drown, especially if the huge stableboy panicked and forgot that Bran was there, the way he did sometimes. Maybe we should have stayed at the inn, under the apple tree, he thought, but by then it was too late.</div>

She took them out step by careful step, probing ahead with her frog spear. They could see where the path emerged again, climbing from the water onto the island and turning into a short flight of stone steps that led to the holdfast door.</div>

<div class="line_en">They found themselves in a gloomy strongroom, barely large enough to hold the four of them. Steps built into the inner wall of the tower curved away upward to their left, downward to their right, behind iron grates. Bran looked up and saw another grate just above his head. A murder hole. He was glad there was no one up there now to pour boiling oil down on them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们发现自己位于一间阴暗封闭、刚够容纳四人的房间里。构筑于墙壁内侧的楼梯左边盘旋向上，右边则是向下，皆被铁栅栏隔开。头顶也有铁栅栏。杀人洞。他很高兴没人从上面倒滚油。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Hodor," said Hodor, straightening.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“阿多。”阿多边说，边直起身子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Thankfully there was no third time, and the water never got up past Hodor's waist, though the Reeds were in it up to their chests. And before long they were on the island, climbing the steps to the holdfast. The door was still stout, though its heavy oak planks had warped over the years and it could no longer be closed completely. Meera shoved it open all the way, the rusted iron hinges screaming. The lintel was low. "Duck down, Hodor," Bran said, and he did, but not enough to keep Bran from hitting his head. "That hurt," he complained.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="谢天谢地，没有第三次受惊。水从未超过阿多的腰，却已没到黎德姐弟的胸口，这时，他们来到岛上，沿着阶梯向塔楼攀登。门依然坚固，但历经年月，沉重的橡木板业已弯曲，再也无法完全阖上。梅拉使劲将它顶开，生锈的铁绞链吱吱作响。门梁很矮。“弯腰，阿多，”布兰说，阿多遵令而行，但弯得不够低，布兰撞到了头。“好疼。”他抱怨。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The grates were locked, but the iron bars were red with rust. Hodor grabbed hold of the lefthand door and gave it a pull, grunting with effort. Nothing happened. He tried pushing with no more success. He shook the bars, kicked, shoved against them and rattled them and punched the hinges with a huge hand until the air was filled with flakes of rust, but the iron door would not budge. The one down to the undervault was no more accommodating. "No way in," said Meera, shrugging.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="栅栏都上了锁，栏杆全是红色铁锈。阿多紧紧抓住左边的门，闷哼一声，使劲拉去，却什么也没发生。他试图往里推，同样毫无建树。接着他摇、踢、撞，把它们弄得嗒嗒直响，又用巨掌砸绞链，直到空中充满铁锈碎屑，但门依旧毫无反应。向下的门也一样难以撼动。“没法进去。”梅拉耸耸肩。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">With the grate gone, Hodor was able to boost Meera and Jojen up through the gaping murder hole. The crannogmen took Bran by the arms and drew him up after them. Getting Hodor inside was the hard part. He was too heavy for the Reeds to lift the way they'd lifted Bran. Finally Bran told him to go look for some big rocks. The island had no lack of those, and Hodor was able to pile them high enough to grab the crumbling edges of the hole and climb through. "Hodor, " he panted happily, grinning at all of them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没了铁栅栏，阿多能够托梅拉和玖健爬进杀人洞。随后两个泽地人抓住布兰的胳膊，将他也拉了上去。阿多是最难的，他太重，黎德姐弟无法像帮布兰那样帮他。布兰只好让他去找些大石头，幸亏岛上大石头不少，阿多将它们堆到够高，然后抓住崩塌的洞孔边缘，也爬了上来。“阿多。”他一边愉快地喘气，一边朝所有人咧嘴笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The murder hole was just above Bran's head, as he sat in his basket on Hodor's back. He reached up and grabbed the bars to give them a try. When he pulled down the grating came out of the ceiling in a cascade of rust and crumbling stone. "HODOR!" Hodor shouted. The heavy iron grate gave Bran another bang in the head, and crashed down near Jojen's feet when he shoved it off of him. Meera laughed. "Look at that, my prince," she said, "you're stronger than Hodor." Bran blushed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布兰坐在阿多背上的篮子里，杀人洞就在头顶上方。他伸手去抓那栏杆，试着拉了拉，不料刚一拽，栅栏门便从天花板上掉落下来，带着阵阵铁锈与碎石。“阿多！”阿多喊。沉重的铁栅栏在布兰头上砸了一下，然后落到玖健身上，玖健将它踢开，梅拉哈哈大笑。“看看，王子殿下，”她说，“你比阿多还强壮呢。”布兰脸红了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They found themselves in a maze of small cells, dark and empty, but Meera explored until she found the way back to the steps. The higher they climbed, the better the light; on the third story the thick outer wall was pierced by arrow slits, the fourth had actual windows, and the fifth and highest was one big round chamber with arched doors on three sides opening onto small stone balconies. On the fourth side was a privy chamber perched above a sewer chute that dropped straight down into the lake.</div>

The rolling plains of the New Gift stretched away to all the other directions, as far as the eye could see. "I was hoping we could see the Wall from here," said Bran, disappointed. "That was stupid, we must still be fifty leagues away." just speaking of it made him feel tired, and cold as well. "Jojen, what will we do when we reach the Wall? My uncle always said how big it was. Seven hundred feet high, and so thick at the base that the gates are more like tunnels through the ice. How are we going to get past to find the three-eyed crow?"</div>

<div class="line_en">The ghost castles, Old Nan had called them. Maester Luwin had once made Bran learn the names of every one of the forts along the Wall. That had been hard; there were nineteen of them all told, though no more than seventeen had ever been manned at any one time. At the feast in honor of King Robert's visit to Winterfell, Bran had recited the names for his uncle Benjen, east to west and then west to east. Benjen Stark had laughed and said, "You know them better than I do, Bran. Perhaps you should be First Ranger. I'll stay here in your place." That was before Bran fell, though. Before he was broken. By the time he'd woken crippled from his sleep, his uncle had gone back to Castle Black.</div>
