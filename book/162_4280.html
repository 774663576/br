<div class="line_en">I shut my eyes, say the word, and I'm back in Italy, so many years ago, walking down the tree-lined driveway, watching him step out of the cab, billowy blue shirt, wide-open collar, sunglasses, straw hat, skin everywhere. Suddenly he's shaking my hand, handing me his backpack, removing his suitcase from the trunk of the cab, asking if my father is home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="闭上眼睛，说出这句话，我仿佛一下子又回到多年前的意大利：我沿着林荫车道走，看着他走下出租车，身上是件宽松的蓝衬衫，领口大敞，戴着太阳眼镜、草帽，露出大片肌肤；下一刻，他就跟我握手，把背包递给我，从出租车后备厢里拿出手提箱，寒暄着问我父亲是否在家。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It might have started right there and then: the shirt, the rolled-up sleeves, the rounded balls of his heels slipping in and out of his frayed espadrilles, eager to test the hot gravel path that led to our house, every stride already asking, Which way to the beach?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一切或许始于那个地方、那个瞬间：那件衬衫、卷起的衣袖、浑圆的脚后跟在磨损的布面平底凉鞋里滑进滑出的样子、急着试探通往我们家的那条砾石道热腾腾的温度，迈开的每一步伐仿佛都在问着：“哪条路通往海边？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then, almost without thinking, and with his back already turned to the car, he waves the back of his free hand and utters a careless Later! to another passenger in the car who has probably split the fare from the station. No name added, no jest to smooth out the ruffled leave-taking, nothing. His one-word send-off: brisk, bold, and blunted -- take your pick, he couldn't be bothered which.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着，背对出租车的他几乎不假思索地挥挥空着的那只手，朝车上另一位或许是从车站一起拼车过来的乘客吐出一句漫不经心的“回头再说”。没加上名字，没有一句俏皮话来缓和告别时那种不甚愉悦的气氛，什么都没有。他那简短的道别显得快活、唐突、干脆——随你怎么说，他才不在乎。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Taking in summer guests was my parents' way of helping young academics revise a manuscript before publication. For six weeks each summer I'd have to vacate my bedroom and move one room down the corridor into a much smaller room that had once belonged to my grandfather. During the winter months, when we were away in the city, it became a part-time toolshed, storage room, and attic where rumor had it my grandfather, my namesake, still ground his teeth in his eternal sleep. Summer residents didn't have to pay anything, were given the full run of the house, and could basically do anything they pleased, provided they spent an hour or so a day helping my father with his correspondence and assorted paperwork. They became part of the family, and after about fifteen years of doing this, we had gotten used to a shower of postcards and gift packages not only around Christmastime but all year long from people who were now totally devoted to our family and would go out of their way when they were in Europe to drop by B. for a day or two with their family and take a nostalgic tour of their old digs.</div>

<div class="line_en">At meals there were frequently two or three other guests, sometimes neighbors or relatives, sometimes colleagues, lawyers, doctors, the rich and famous who'd drop by to see my father on their way to their own summer houses. Sometimes we'd even open our dining room to the occasional tourist couple who'd heard of the old villa and simply wanted to come by and take a peek and were totally enchanted when asked to eat with us and tell us all about themselves, while Mafalda, informed at the last minute, dished out her usual fare. My father, who was reserved and shy in private, loved nothing better than to have some precocious rising expert in a field keep the conversation going in a few languages while the hot summer sun, after a few glasses of rosatello, ushered in the unavoidable afternoon torpor. We named the task dinner drudgery -- and, after a while, so did most of our six-week guests.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="用餐时刻往往会多两三位客人，有时候是邻居或亲戚，有时候是同事、律师、医生等等名流，在前往自家的夏季别墅前顺路来探访我的父亲。有时候我们甚至开放餐厅给偶尔来访的夫妻或情侣旅客，他们因耳闻这栋老别墅，单纯想来一窥究竟。这些人受邀与我们共餐时，简直心醉神迷，然后热情地闲聊关于自己的一切。总在最后一分钟才接到这种临时通知的玛法尔达则会端上她的拿手菜。私底下内敛害羞的父亲其实最喜欢听在某些领域学有专长的新星以数种语言高谈阔论；伴着几杯玫瑰红下肚，坐在午后炎热的夏日阳光下，人不免变得呆滞。我们总把这段时光称为“正餐苦差”——过不了多久，那些即将长住六周的访客也会这么说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Maybe it started soon after his arrival during one of those grinding lunches when he sat next to me and it finally dawned on me that, despite a light tan acquired during his brief stay in Sicily earlier that summer, the color on the palms of his hands was the same as the pale, soft skin of his soles, of his throat, of the bottom of his forearms, which hadn't really been exposed to much sun. Almost a light pink, as glistening and smooth as the underside of a lizard's belly. Private, chaste, unfledged, like a blush on an athlete's face or an instance of dawn on a stormy night. It told me things about him I never knew to ask.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一切或许始于他抵达不久后某一次磨人的午餐。当时他坐在我旁边，我总算注意到尽管那年夏天他在西西里岛逗留时晒得有点黑，但他掌心的颜色和他脚底、喉咙、前臂内侧一般白皙柔软，因为没有太多暴露在太阳下，几乎是淡粉色，像蜥蜴腹部一样光亮平滑。私密、纯洁、青涩，就像运动员脸上的红晕，像暴风雨夜的黎明曙光，透露了一些我完全不需要去问的事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It may have started during those endless hours after lunch when everybody lounged about in bathing suits inside and outside the house, bodies sprawled everywhere, killing time before someone finally suggested we head down to the rocks for a swim. Relatives, cousins, neighbors, friends, friends of friends, colleagues, or just about anyone who cared to knock at our gate and ask if they could use our tennis court -- everyone was welcome to lounge and swim and eat and, if they stayed long enough, use the guesthouse.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一切或许始于午餐后那些无止无尽的空闲时段，大伙儿都穿着泳衣，在屋子内外闲晃或躺倒来消磨时间，直到终于有人提议到礁石那边去游泳。不论是近亲远邻、朋友、朋友的朋友、同事，或随便哪个愿意敲我们的门、询问可否借用网球场的人，人人都被欢迎来这儿自由闲逛、游泳，与我们一同用餐；如果待得够久，当然还可以在客房留宿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Or perhaps it started on the beach. Or at the tennis court. Or during our first walk together on his very first day when I was asked to show him the house and its surrounding area and, one thing leading to the other, managed to take him past the very old forged-iron metal gate as far back as the endless empty lot in the hinterland toward the abandoned train tracks that used to connect B. to N. "Is there an abandoned station house somewhere?" he asked, looking through the trees under the scalding sun, probably trying to ask the right question of the owner's son. "No, there was never a station house. The train simply stopped when you asked." He was curious about the train; the rails seemed so narrow. It was a two-wagon train bearing the royal insignia, I explained. Gypsies lived in it now. They'd been living there ever since my mother used to summer here as a girl. The gypsies had hauled the two derailed cars farther inland. Did he want to see them? "Later. Maybe." Polite indifference, as if he'd spotted my misplaced zeal to play up to him and was summarily pushing me away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="又或者一切始于海边。或在网球场上。或者就在他刚到的第一天，我们第一次并肩同行，我遵照嘱咐为他介绍房子，带他参观周边。走着走着，我总算带他深入到偏僻区域那块仿佛无边无际的荒地，通过那道古老的锻铁金属门，往曾经连接B城与N城、如今弃置已久的那段铁轨走去。“附近有废弃火车站吗？”他抬眼望向烈阳下树林深处的另一头，或许是想对屋主的儿子提出恰到好处的问题。“没有，附近从来就没有火车站。火车只是随叫随停。”他对火车很好奇，因为铁轨看起来那么窄。是有皇家标志的无顶货车，我解释道。现在是吉普赛人住在里面。从我母亲少女时期到这儿来避暑时，他们就住在那里，还把两截脱轨的货车拖到更远的内陆去了。我问他想看吗？“回头再说。或许吧。”有礼的冷淡，仿佛他识破了我以不合时宜的热情去讨好他，还立刻一把推开我。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I had put reading last on my list, thinking that, with the willful, brazen attitude he'd displayed so far, reading would figure last on his. A few hours later, when I remembered that he had just finished writing a book on Heraclitus and that "reading" was probably not an insignificant part of his life, I realized that I needed to perform some clever backpedaling and let him know that my real interests lay right alongside his. What unsettled me, though, was not the fancy footwork needed to redeem myself. It was the unwelcome misgivings with which it finally dawned on me, both then and during our casual conversation by the train tracks, that I had all along, without seeming to, without even admitting it, already been trying -- and failing -- to win him over.</div>

<div class="line_en">At dinner on his third evening, I sensed that he was staring at me as I was explaining Haydn's Seven Last Words of Christ, which I'd been transcribing. I was seventeen that year and, being the youngest at the table and the least likely to be listened to, I had developed the habit of smuggling as much information into the fewest possible words. I spoke fast, which gave people the impression that I was always flustered and muffling my words. After I had finished explaining my transcription, I became aware of the keenest glance coming from my left. It thrilled and flattered me; he was obviously interested -- he liked me. It hadn't been as difficult as all that, then. But when, after taking my time, I finally turned to face him and take in his glance, I met a cold and icy glare -- something at once hostile and vitrified that bordered on cruelty.</div>

<div class="line_en">It undid me completely. What had I done to deserve this?

<div class="line_en">Today, the pain, the stoking, the thrill of someone new, the promise of so much bliss hovering a fingertip away, the fumbling around people I might misread and don't want to lose and must second-guess at every turn, the desperate cunning I bring to everyone I want and crave to be wanted by, the screens I put up as though between me and the world there were not just one but layers of rice-paper sliding doors, the urge to scramble and unscramble what was never really coded in the first place -- all these started the summer Oliver came into our house. They are embossed on every song that was a hit that summer, in every novel I read during and after his stay, on anything from the smell of rosemary on hot days to the frantic rattle of the cicadas in the afternoon -- smells and sounds I'd grown up with and known every year of my life until then but that had suddenly turned on me and acquired an inflection forever colored by the events of that summer.</div>

<div class="line_en">Or perhaps it started after his first week, when I was thrilled to see he still remembered who I was, that he didn't ignore me, and that, therefore, I could allow myself the luxury of passing him on my way to the garden and not having to pretend I was unaware of him. We jogged early on the first morning -- all the way up to B. and back. Early the next morning we swam. Then, the day after, we jogged again. I liked racing by the milk delivery van When it was far from done with its rounds, or by the grocer and the baker as they were just getting ready for business, liked to run along the shore and the promenade when there wasn't a soul about yet and our house seemed a distant mirage. I liked it when our feet were aligned, left with left, and struck the ground at the same time, leaving footprints on the shore that I wished to return to and, in secret, place my foot where his had left its mark.</div>

<div class="line_en">This alternation of running and swimming was simply his "routine" in graduate school. Did he run on the Sabbath? I joked. He always exercised, even when he was sick; he'd exercise in bed if he had to. Even when he'd slept with someone new the night before, he said, he'd still head out for a jog early in the morning. The only time he didn't exercise was when they operated on him. When I asked him what for, the answer I had promised never to incite in him came at me like the thwack of a jack-in-the-box wearing a baleful smirk. "Later."</div>

<div class="line_en">Then came that July Sunday afternoon when our house suddenly emptied, and we were the only ones there, and fire tore through my guts -- because "fire" was the first and easiest word that came to me later that same evening when 1 tried to make sense of it in my diary. I'd waited and waited in my room pinioned to my bed in a trancelike state of terror and anticipation. Not a fire of passion, not a ravaging fire, but something paralyzing, like the fire of cluster bombs that suck up the oxygen around them and leave you panting because you've been kicked in the gut and a vacuum has ripped up every living lung tissue and dried your mouth, and you hope nobody speaks, because you can't talk, and you pray no one asks you to move, because your heart is clogged and beats so fast it would sooner spit out shards of glass than let anything else flow through its narrowed chambers. Fire like fear, like panic, like one more minute of this and I'll die if he doesn't knock at my door, but I'd sooner he never knock than knock now. I had learned to leave my French windows ajar, and I'd lie on my bed wearing only my bathing suit, my entire body on fire. Fire like a pleading that says, Please, please, tell me I'm wrong, tell me I've imagined all this, because it can't possibly be true for you as well, and if it's true for you too, then you're the crudest man alive. This, the afternoon he did finally walk into my room without knocking as if summoned by my prayers and asked how come I wasn't with the others at the beach, and all I could think of saying, though I couldn't bring myself to say it, was, To be with you. To be with you, Oliver. With or without my bathing suit. To be with you on my bed. In your bed. Which is my bed during the other months of the year? Do with me what you want. Take me. Just ask if I want to and see the answer you'll get, just don't let me say no.</div>

But I was so spellbound that I wrenched myself free from his touch, because a moment longer and I would have slackened like one of those tiny wooden toys whose gimp-legged body collapses as soon as the mainsprings are touched. Taken aback, he apologized and asked if he had pressed a "nerve or something"-- he hadn't meant to hurt me. He must have felt thoroughly mortified if he suspected he had either hurt me or touched me the wrong way. The last thing I wanted was to discourage him. Still, I blurted something like, "It didn't hurt," and would have dropped the matter there. But I sensed that if it wasn't pain that had prompted such a reaction, what other explanation could account for my shrugging him off so brusquely in front of my friends?

<div class="line_en">Perhaps, in this, as with everything else, because I didn't know how to speak in code, I didn't know how to speak at all. I felt like a deaf and dumb person who can't even use sign language. I stammered all manner of things so as not to speak my mind. That was the extent of my code. So long as I had breath to put words in my mouth, I could more or less carry it off. Otherwise, the silence between us would probably give me away -- which was why anything, even the most spluttered nonsense, was preferable to silence. Silence would expose me. But what was certain to expose me even more was my struggle to overcome it in front of others.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我当下的反应，就像面对其他事情一般，不知道如何含蓄暗示，只能沉默以对。我像个还没学会手语的聋哑人，结结巴巴东拉西扯，以免吐露心声。这就是我使用暗语的程度。只要我还能撑得住隐藏不说，我多少就能若无其事地应付过去。否则，我们之间的沉默或许会使我暴露无遗。再怎么语无伦次也比沉默来得好。沉默或许会让我露出马脚，但我在别人面前拼命压抑的模样，铁定泄露更多。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The despair aimed at myself must have given my features something bordering on impatience and unspoken rage. That he might have mistaken these as aimed at him never crossed my mind.</div>

<div class="line_en">Maybe it was for similar reasons that I would look away each time he looked at me: to conceal the strain on my timidity. That he might have found my avoidance offensive and retaliated with a hostile glance from time to time never crossed my mind either.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="还有一件事，或许也出于类似的理由。他一看过来，我就撇开目光，这只是为了隐藏我的胆怯造成的紧张。他可能觉得我这样回避很失礼，才不时以带着敌意的眼神报复——这一点我当时也毫无头绪。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"What I hoped he hadn't noticed in my overreaction to his grip was something else. Before shirking off his arm, I knew I had yielded to his hand and had almost leaned into it, as if to say -- as I'd heard adults so often say when someone happened to massage their shoulders while passing behind them -- Don't stop. Had he noticed I was ready not just to yield but to mold into his body?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我希望他没有从我的过度反应中察觉到什么，这是另一回事。但在躲开他的手臂之前，我知道我早已向他屈服，几乎像是贴了上去，仿佛要说：“别停”（就像我听到那些成年人在有人偶然经过他们身后为他们按摩肩膀时常常这样说）。他有没有注意到我随时准备屈服于他，还想与他合为一体？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="这也是我当晚日记里所描绘的感觉，我称之为“意乱情迷”。我为什么意乱情迷？这种情感来得如此轻易吗？只要他轻轻一碰我，我就双脚发软，神魂颠倒？这是大家所说的“如奶油般融化”吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And why wouldn't I show him how like butter I was? Because I was afraid of what might happen then? Or was I afraid he would have laughed at me, told everyone, or ignored the whole thing on the pretext I was too young to know what I was doing? Or was it because if he so much as suspected -- and anyone who suspected would of necessity be on the same wavelength -- he might be tempted to act on it? Did I want him to act? Or would I prefer a lifetime of longing provided we both kept this little Ping-Pong game going: not knowing, not-not knowing, not-not-not knowing? Just be quiet, say nothing, and if you can't say "yes," don't say "no," say "later." Is this why people say "maybe" when they mean "yes," but hope you'll think it's "no' when all they really mean is, Please, just ask me once more, and once more after that?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我为什么不愿意让他知道我多容易软化？因为害怕随之而来的后果？怕他笑我？怕他四处宣扬？怕他拿我太年轻、不知道自己在做什么为借口，因而置之不理？或者他有那么点起了疑心，他或许会想要因此采取行动？我希望他行动吗？或者我宁可一辈子渴望，只要双方继续这种你来我往的猜谜游戏：不知道、知道、不知道？保持沉默就好，什么都别说；如果你不答应，也别拒绝，就说“回头再说”吧——大家不都这么做吗？即使同意，也要来句模糊的“或许吧”，表面看来像是拒绝，隐藏的真意却是：拜托，请再问我一次，再多问一次。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I look back to that summer and can't believe that despite every one of my efforts to live with the "fire" and the "swoon," life still granted wonderful moments. Italy. Summer. The noise of the cicadas in the early afternoon. My room. His room. Our balcony that shut the whole world out. The soft wind trailing exhalations from our garden up the stairs to my bedroom. The summer I learned to love fishing. Because he did. To love jogging. Because he did. To love octopus, Heraclitus, Tristan. The summer I'd hear a bird sing, smell a plant, or feel the mist rise from under my feet on warm sunny days and, because my senses were always on alert, would automatically find them rushing to him.</div>

<div class="line_en">But it was the gold necklace and the Star of David with a golden mezuzah on his neck that told me here was something more compelling than anything I wanted from him, for it bound us and reminded me that, while everything else conspired to make us the two most dissimilar beings, this at least transcended all differences. I saw his star almost immediately during his first day with us. And from that moment on I knew that what mystified me and made me want to seek out his friendship, without ever hoping to find ways to dislike him, was larger than anything either of us could ever want from the other, larger and therefore better than his soul, my body, or earth itself. Staring at his neck with its star and telltale amulet was like staring at something timeless, ancestral, immortal in me, in him, in both of us, begging to be rekindled and brought back from its millenary sleep.</div>

<div class="line_en">With the exception of my family, he was probably the only other Jew who had ever set foot in B. But unlike us he let you see it from the very start. We were not conspicuous Jews. We wore our Judaism as people do almost everywhere in the world: under the shirt, not hidden, but tucked away. "Jews of discretion," to use my mother's words. To see someone proclaim his Judaism on his neck as Oliver did when he grabbed one of our bikes and headed into town with his shirt wide open shocked us as much as it taught us we could do the same and get away with it. I tried imitating him a few times. But I was too self-conscious, like someone trying to feel natural while walking about naked in a locker room only to end up aroused by his own nakedness. In town, I tried flaunting my Judaism with the silent bluster that comes less from arrogance than from repressed shame. Not him. It's not that he never thought about being Jewish or about the life of Jews in a Catholic country. Sometimes we spoke about just this topic during those long afternoons when both of us would put aside work and enjoy chatting while the entire household and guests had all drifted into every available bedroom to rest for a few hours. He had lived long enough in small towns in New England to know what it felt like to be the odd Jew out. But Judaism never troubled him the way it troubled me, nor was it the subject of an abiding, metaphysical discomfort with himself and the world. It did not even harbor the mystical, unspoken promise of redemptive brotherhood. And perhaps this was why he wasn't ill at ease with being Jewish and didn't constantly have to pick at it, the way children pick at scabs they wish would go away. He was okay with being Jewish. He was okay with himself, the way he was okay with his body, with his looks, with his antic backhand, with his choice of books, music, films, friends. He was okay with losing his prized Mont Blanc pen. "I can buy another one just like it." He was okay with criticism too. He showed my father a few pages he was proud of having written. My father told him his insights into Heraclitus were brilliant but needed firming up, that he needed to accept the paradoxical nature of the philosopher's thinking, not simply explain it away. He was okay with firming things up, he was okay with paradox. Back to the drawing board -- he was okay with the drawing board as well. He invited my young aunt for a tête-à-tête midnight gita -- spin -- in our motorboat. She declined. That was okay. He tried again a few days later, was turned down again, and again made light of it. She too was okay with it, and, had she spent another week with us, would probably have been okay with going out to sea for a midnight gita that could easily have lasted till sunrise.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="除了我的家人之外，涉足B城的犹太人或许只有他一个了。但他与我们不同，他从一开始就亮给人看。我的家人从不高调彰显犹太人身份，而是像其他分散世界各地的犹太人一样，放在衬衫里，不加隐藏却保持低调——借用我母亲的话来说，我们是“谨慎的犹太人”。看见奥利弗敞着衬衫领口宣告项链所代表的犹太信仰，直接骑上家里的脚踏车进城，令我们震惊，同时也让我们知道我们也可以这样，完全不会遇上什么麻烦。我几次试着学他那样出门，可是我太放不开，像个想要大大方方光着身子在更衣室走动的人，到头来却被自己的裸体勾起了性欲。更多是出于压抑的羞耻感而非自大的心态，我试着在城里以一种静默的虚张声势来昭示我的犹太信仰；而他则不然，尽管他并非从未考虑过在这个天主教国度里身为犹太人意味着什么，或犹太人的生活是怎样的。偶尔在漫长的午后，趁着一家老小和客人全都懒洋洋地晃进空余卧房里小憩个把钟头的时候，我俩会抛开工作，愉快地聊天，而我们讨论的正是这个话题。他曾在美国新英格兰的几个小镇住过相当长一段时间，很清楚犹太人只身在异乡的局外人感受，但犹太信仰带给我的困扰从未发生在他身上，也从来不是他自处或面对世界时，那个会引发永恒不变的、深奥难解的苦恼不安的主题。犹太信仰甚至并不包含那种玄秘的、未以言明的关于相互救赎的兄弟关系的美好预言。或许正是出于这个理由，犹太人身份对他丝毫不是困扰，他也不需要时不时就此烦恼一下，不像小孩子经常去抠伤疤，盼望着疤痕早些消失。身为犹太人对他而言不是问题。他很能接受自己，就像他接受自己的身体，接受自己的相貌，接受自己古怪的反手拍动作，接受自己选择读的书、听的音乐、看的电影和交的朋友。他弄丢了获奖得来的万宝龙钢笔也不介意。“我可以自己买支一模一样的。”他也不介意批评。他拿了几页引以为傲的文章给我父亲看。父亲告诉他，他对赫拉克利特的见解很精彩，但论点还需加强，他必须接受哲学家思想中的悖论本质，而不是一味找理由开脱。于是他接受立论必须加强的意见，也接受悖论，重起炉灶——他不介意从头开始修改文章。他邀请我的小阿姨半夜单独（开我们的汽艇）去gita，也就是兜风。小阿姨拒绝了。没关系。几天后他又试一次，再度遭拒，同样不以为意。小阿姨也无所谓，若是再多住一周，她或许就会答应半夜出海去兜风，甚至玩到天亮。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Only once during his very first few days did I get a sense that this willful but accommodating, laid-back, water-over-my-back, unflappable, unfazed twenty-four-year-old who was so heedlessly okay with so many things in life was, in fact, a thoroughly alert, cold, sagacious judge of character and situations. Nothing he did or said was unpremeditated. He saw through everybody, but he saw through them precisely because the first thing he looked for in people was the very thing he had seen in himself and may not have wished others to see. He was, as my mother was scandalized to learn one day, a supreme poker player who'd escape into town at night twice a week or so to "play a few hands." This was why, to our complete surprise, he had insisted on opening a bank account on the very day of his arrival. None of our residents had ever had a local bank account. Most didn't have a penny.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Do you really think so, Pro?" Oliver interrupted, unaware that my father, while very easygoing himself, did not always like being contradicted, much less being called Pro, though he went along with both. "Yes, I do," insisted my father. "Well, I'm not sure I agree at all. I find him arrogant, dull, flat-footed, and coarse. He uses humor and a lot of voice"-- Oliver mimicked the man's gravitas --"and broad gestures to nudge his audience because he is totally incapable of arguing a case. The voice thing is so over the top, Pro. People laugh at his humor not because he is funny but because he telegraphs his desire to be funny. His humor is nothing more than a way of winning over people he can't persuade.

<div class="line_en">What struck me was not just his amazing gift for reading people, for rummaging inside them and digging out the precise configuration of their personality, but his ability to intuit things in exactly the way I myself might have intuited them. This, in the end, was what drew me to him with a compulsion that overrode desire or friendship or the allurements of a common religion. "How about catching a movie?" he blurted out one evening when we were all sitting together, as if he'd suddenly hit on a solution to what promised to be a dull night indoors. We had just left the dinner table where my father, as was his habit these days, had been urging me to try to go out with friends more often, especially in the evening. It bordered on a lecture. Oliver was still new with us and knew no one in town, so I must have seemed as good a movie partner as any. But he had asked his question in far too breezy and spontaneous a manner, as though he wanted me and everyone else in the living room to know that he was hardly invested in going to the movies and could just as readily stay home and go over his manuscript. The carefree inflection of his offer, however, was also a wink aimed at my father: he was only pretending to have come up with the idea; in fact, without letting me suspect it, he was picking up on my father's advice at the dinner table and was offering to go for my benefit alone.</div>

<div class="line_en">I smiled, not at the offer, but at the double-edged maneuver. He immediately caught my smile. And having caught it, smiled back, almost in self-mockery, sensing that if he gave any sign of guessing I'd seen through his ruse he'd be confirming his guilt, but that refusing to own up to it, after I'd made clear I'd intercepted it, would indict him even more. So he smiled to confess he'd been caught but also to show he was a good enough sport to own up to it and still enjoy going to the movies together. The whole thing thrilled me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我笑了，不为他的提议，而是因为他两方讨好的策略。他立刻看到我的笑脸。既然看到了，也近乎自嘲般回以一笑，他意识到如果流露出任何猜到我已看穿他的迹象，他就得认罪；既然我表明早已看穿他的意图，他还拒绝爽快承认，更是罪加一等。所以他微笑承认自己被识破，但也想以此表明自己够上道、肯承认，而且仍然乐意一起去看电影。这整件事令我兴奋不已。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Or perhaps his smile was his way of countering my reading tit for tat with the unstated suggestion that, much as he'd been caught trying to affect total casualness on the face of his offer, he too had found something to smile about in me -- namely, the shrewd, devious, guilty pleasure I derived in finding so many imperceptible affinities between us. There may have been nothing there, and I might have invented the whole thing. But both of us knew what the other had seen. That evening, as we biked to the movie theater, I was -- and I didn't care to hide it -- riding on air.</div>

<div class="line_en">So, with so much insight, would he not have noticed the meaning behind my abrupt shrinking away from his hand? Not notice that I'd leaned into his grip? Not know that I didn't want him to let go of me? Not sense that when he started massaging me, my inability to relax was my last refuge, my last defense, my last pretense, that I had by no means resisted, that mine was fake resistance, that I was incapable of resisting and would never want to resist, no matter what he did or asked me to do? Not know, as I sat on my bed that Sunday afternoon when no one was home except for the two of us and watched him enter my room and ask me why I wasn't with the others at the beach, that if I refused to answer and simply shrugged my shoulders under his gaze, it was simply so as not to show that I couldn't gather sufficient breath to speak, that if I so much as let out a sound it might be to utter a desperate confession or a sob -- one or the other? Never, since childhood, had anyone brought me to such a pass. Bad allergy, I'd said. Me too, he replied. We probably have the same one. Again I shrugged my shoulders. He picked up my old teddy bear in one hand, turned its face toward him, and whispered something into its ear. Then, turning the teddy's face to me and altering his voice, asked, "What's wrong? You're upset." By then he must have noticed the bathing suit I was wearing. Was I wearing it lower than was decent? "Want to go for a swim?" he asked. "Later, maybe," I said, echoing his word but also trying to say as little as possible before he'd spot I was out of breath. "Let's go now." He extended his hand to help me get up. I grabbed it and, turning on my side facing the wall away from him to prevent him from seeing me, I asked, "Must we?" This was the closest I would ever come to saying, Stay. Just stay with me. Let your hand travel wherever it wishes, take my suit off, take me, I won't make a noise, won't tell a soul, I'm hard and you know it, and if you won't, I'll take that hand of yours and slip it into my suit now and let you put as many fingers as you want inside me.</div>

It would never have entered my mind because I was still under the illusion that, barring what I'd read in books, inferred from rumors, and overheard in bawdy talk all over, no one my age had ever wanted to be both man and woman -- with men and women. I had wanted other men my age before and had slept with women.

<div class="line_en">And yet, about two weeks after his arrival, all I wanted every night was for him to leave his room, not via its front door, but through the French windows on our balcony. I wanted to hear his window open, hear his espadrilles on the balcony, and then the sound of my own window, which was never locked, being pushed open as he'd step into my room after everyone had gone to bed, slip under my covers, undress me without asking, and after making me want him more than I thought I could ever want another living soul, gently, softly, and, with the kindness one Jew extends to another, work his way into my body, gently and softly, after heeding the words I'd been rehearsing for days now, Please, don't hurt me, which meant, Hurt me all you want.</div>

<div class="line_en">I seldom stayed in my room during the day. Instead, for the past few summers I had appropriated a round table with an umbrella in the back garden by the pool. Pavel, our previous summer resident, had liked working in his room, occasionally stepping out onto the balcony to get a glimpse of the sea or smoke a cigarette. Maynard, before him, had also worked in his room. Oliver needed company. He began by sharing my table but eventually grew to like throwing a large sheet on the grass and lying on it, flanked by loose pages of his manuscript and what he liked to call his "things": lemonade, suntan lotion, books, espadrilles, sunglasses, colored pens, and music, which he listened to with headphones, so that it was impossible to speak to him unless he was speaking to you first. Sometimes, when I came downstairs with my scorebook or other books in the morning, he was already sprawled in the sun wearing his red or yellow bathing suit and sweating. We'd go jogging or swimming, and return to find breakfast waiting for us. Then he got in the habit of leaving his "things" on the grass and lying right on the tiled edge of the pool -- called "heaven," short for "This is heaven," as he often said after lunch, "I'm going to heaven now," adding, as an inside joke among Latinists, "to apricate." We would tease him about the countless hours he would spend soaking in suntan lotion as he lay on the same exact spot along the pool. "How long were you in heaven this morning?" my mother would ask. "Two straight hours. But I plan to return early this afternoon for a much longer aprication." Going to the orle of paradise also meant lying on his back along the edge of the pool with one leg dangling in the water, wearing his headphones and his straw hat flat on his face.</div>

It started as a putdown and soon enough became an endearment, to go along with her other nickname for him, conferred during his first week, when he came down to the dinner table after showering, his glistening hair combed back. La star, she had said, short for la muvi star. My father, always the most indulgent among us, but also the most observant, had figured the cauboi out.

<div class="line_en">In fact, he knew more about apricots than we did -- their grafts, etymology, origins, fortunes in and around the Mediterranean. At the breakfast table that morning, my father explained that the name for the fruit came from the Arabic, since the word -- in Italian, albicocca, abricot in French, aprikose in German, like the words 'algebra,' 'alchemy,' and 'alcohol' -- was derived from an Arabic noun combined with the Arabic article al- before it. The origin of albicocca was al-birquq. My father, who couldn't resist not leaving well enough alone and needed to top his entire performance with a little fillip of more recent vintage, added that what was truly amazing was that, in Israel and in many Arab countries nowadays, the fruit is referred to by a totally different name: misbmish.</div>

In the case of 'apricot,' however, it's the other way around; the Greek takes over from Latin. The Latin word was praecoquum, from pre-coquere, pre-cook, to ripen early, as in 'precocious,' meaning premature. The Byzantines borrowed praecox, and it became prekokkia or berikokki, which is finally how the Arabs must have inherited it as al-birquq."</div>

<div class="line_en">Oliver, it turned out, knew more about all manner of foods, cheeses, and wines than all of us put together.

I should have added an extra egg -- it's not holding! Should I use the new blender or should I stick to the old mortar and pestle? My mother couldn't resist throwing in a barb or two.

<div class="line_en">With any of our other summer residents I would have resented it. But seeing everyone take such a liking to him, I found a strange, small oasis of peace. What could possibly be wrong with liking someone everyone else liked? Everyone had fallen for him, including my first and second cousins as well as my other relatives, who stayed with us on weekends and sometimes longer. For someone known to love spotting defects in everyone else, I derived a certain satisfaction from concealing my feelings for him behind my usual indifference, hostility, or spite for anyone in a position to outshine me at home. Because everyone liked him, I had to say I liked him too. I was like men who openly declare other men irresistibly handsome the better to conceal that they're aching to embrace them. To withhold universal approval would simply alert others that I had concealed motives for needing to resist him. Oh, I like him very much, I said during his first ten days when my father asked me what I thought of him. I had used words intentionally compromising because I knew no one would suspect a false bottom in the arcane palette of shadings I applied to everything I said about him. He's the best person I've known in my life, I said on the night when the tiny fishing boat on which he had sailed out with Anchise early that afternoon failed to return and we were scrambling to find his parents' telephone number in the States in case we had to break the terrible news.</div>

I was the first to recognize his steps when he arrived late at the movie theater one night and stood there looking for the rest of us, not uttering a sound until I turned around knowing he'd be overjoyed I'd spotted him. I recognized him by the inflection of his footfalls up the stairway to our balcony or on the landing outside my bedroom door. I knew when he stopped outside my French windows, as if debating whether to knock and then thinking twice, and continued walking. I knew it was he riding a bicycle by the way the bike skidded ever so mischievously on the deep gravel path and still kept going when it was obvious there couldn't be any traction left, only to come to a sudden, bold, determined stop, with something of a declarative voila in the way he jumped off.</div>

My father always wanted them to feel free to "talk" their books and expertise around town. He also believed that scholars should learn how to speak to the layman, which was why he always had lawyers, doctors, businessmen over for meals. Everyone in Italy has read Dante, Homer, and Virgil, he'd say. Doesn't matter whom you're talking to, so long as you Dante-and-Homer them first. Virgil is a must, Leopardi comes next, and then feel free to dazzle them with everything you've got, Celan, celery, salami, who cares. This also had the advantage of allowing all of our summer residents to perfect their Italian, one of the requirements of the residency. Having them on the dinner circuit around B. also had another benefit: it relieved us from having them at our table every single night of the week.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then there are the leftover scenes: my father always wondering what I did with my time, why I was always alone; my mother urging me to make new friends if the old ones didn't interest me, but above all to stop hanging around the house all the time -- books, books, books, always books, and all these scorebooks, both of them begging me to play more tennis, go dancing more often, get to know people, find out for myself why others are so necessary in life and not just foreign bodies to be sidled up to. Do crazy things if you must, they told me all the while, forever prying to unearth the mysterious, telltale signs of heartbreak which, in their clumsy, intrusive, devoted way, both would instantly wish to heal, as if I were a soldier who had strayed into their garden and needed his wound immediately stanched or else he'd die.</div>

I didn't know what I was afraid of, nor why I worried so much, nor why this thing that could so easily cause panic felt like hope sometimes and, like hope in the darkest moments, brought such joy, unreal joy, joy with a noose tied around it. The thud my heart gave when I saw him unannounced both terrified and thrilled me. I was afraid when he showed up, afraid when he failed to, afraid when he looked at me, more frightened yet when he didn't. The agony wore me out in the end, and, on scalding afternoons, I'd simply give out and fall asleep on the living room sofa and, though still dreaming, know exactly who was in the room, who had tiptoed in and out, who was standing there, who was looking at me and for how long, who was trying to pick out today's paper while making the least rustling sound, only to give up and look for tonight's film listings whether they woke me or not.</div>

<div class="line_en">The fear never went away. I woke up to it, watched it turn to joy when I heard him shower in the morning and knew he'd be downstairs with us for breakfast, only to watch it curdle when, rather than have coffee, he would dash through the house and right away set to work in the garden. By noon, the agony of waiting to hear him say anything to me was more than I could bear. I knew that the sofa awaited me in an hour or so. It made me hate myself for feeling so hapless, so thoroughly invisible, so smitten, so callow. Just say something, just touch me, Oliver. Look at me long enough and watch the tears well in my eyes.

<div class="line_en">My parents, my father especially, couldn't have been happier with him. Oliver was working out better than most of our summer residents. He helped my father organize his papers, managed a good deal of his foreign correspondence, and was clearly coming along with his own book.

I mentioned his absence only when one of them wondered where he'd been; I would pretend to look as startled as they were. Oh, that's right, he's been gone so long. No, no idea. And I had to worry not to look too startled either, for that might ring false and alert them to what was eating at me. They'd know bad faith as soon as they spotted it. I was surprised they hadn't already. They had always said I got too easily attached to people. This summer, though, I finally realized what they meant by being too easily attached. Obviously, it had happened before, and they must have already picked up on it when I was probably too young to notice anything myself. It had sent alarming ripples through their lives. They worried for me. I knew they were right to worry. I just hoped they'd never know how far things stood beyond their ordinary worries now. I knew they didn't suspect a thing, and it bothered me -- though I wouldn't have wanted it otherwise. It told me that if I were no longer transparent and could disguise so much of my life, then I was finally safe from them, and from him -- but at what price, and did I want to be so safe from anyone?</div>

<div class="line_en">One afternoon, when I knew that the house was totally empty, I went up to his room. I opened his closet and, as this was my room when there were no residents, pretended to be looking for something I'd left behind in one of the bottom drawers. I'd planned to rifle through his papers, but as soon as I opened his closet, I saw it. Hanging on a hook was this morning's red bathing suit which he hadn't swum in, which was why it was hanging there and not drying on the balcony. I picked it up, never in my life having pried into anyone's personal belongings before. I brought the bathing suit to my face, then rubbed my face inside of it, as if I were trying to snuggle into it and lose myself inside its folds -- So this is what he smells like when his body isn't covered in suntan lotion, this is what he smells like, this is what he smells like, I kept repeating to myself, looking inside the suit for something more personal yet than his smell and then kissing every corner of it, almost wishing to find hair, anything, to lick it, to put the whole bathing suit into my mouth, and, if I could only steal it, keep it with me forever, never ever let Mafalda wash it, turn to it in the winter months at home and, on sniffing it, bring him back to life, as naked as he was with me at this very moment. On impulse, I removed my bathing suit and began to put his on. I knew what I wanted, and I wanted it with the kind of intoxicated rapture that makes people take risks they would never take even with plenty of alcohol in their system. I wanted to come in his suit, and leave the evidence for him to find there. Which was when a crazier notion possessed me. I undid his bed, took off his suit, and cuddled it between his sheets, naked. Let him find me -- I'll deal with it, one way or another. I recognized the feel of the bed. My bed. But the smell of him was all around me, wholesome and forgiving, like the strange scent which had suddenly come over my entire body when an elderly man who happened to be standing right next to me in a temple on Yom Kippur placed his tallis over my head till I had all but disappeared and was now united with a nation that is forever dispersed but which, from time to time, comes together again when one being and another wrap themselves under the same piece of cloth. I put his pillow over my face, kissed it savagely, and, wrapping my legs around it, told it what I lacked the courage to tell everyone else in the world. Then I told him what I wanted. It took less than a minute.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一天下午，我发现屋里空无一人，于是我上楼走进他房间，打开他的衣柜——没有住客的时候，这里是我的房间，我假装想找我落在底层抽屉的东西。我原本打算快速翻找他的文件，但一打开衣柜，我就看见那个。吊在挂钩上的，是今天早上他没穿去游泳的红色泳裤，所以吊在衣柜里，而不是晾在阳台上。我这辈子从没窥看过他人的私人物品。我拿起他的泳裤，拿到面前，原来这就是他身上没涂防晒乳液时的味道啊。这就是他的味道，这就是他的味道，但愿我能偷走它，永远放在身边，永远不让玛法尔达洗，在冬天离开这儿的那几个月求助于它，嗅着它，让奥利弗重生，像他此刻一样赤裸裸与我在一起。一阵冲动之下，我脱掉我的泳裤，穿上他的。我知道我想要什么，而且我是抱着一种沉醉的狂喜想要这个东西，我想要冒险，一个人即使在烂醉时也绝对不愿意冒的险。我想穿着他的泳裤达到高潮，留下证据让他发现。这时一个更疯狂的念头攫住了我的心。我摊开他的被褥，脱下他的泳裤，一丝不挂地躺在他的被单下搂着他的泳裤。让他发现我吧——我会面对他，总有办法的。我认得这张床的感觉。我的床。但他的气味围绕着我，健康、宽容，就像在犹太教赎罪日[26]那天，一个碰巧站在我旁边的陌生人把他的祈祷披肩披在我头上盖住我时，我突然闻到的怪味，那气味与那个族人四散的国家合为一体，只有当一个人与另一个人将自己包裹在同一块布里时，这个民族会再度聚合起来。我拿起他的枕头盖在自己脸上，粗野地吻它，双腿夹着它，告诉它我没有勇气对世界上其他人说的事。我告诉它我想要什么。只花不到一分钟。【注：[26]赎罪日（赎罪日为七月初十，即犹太新年（又称岁首节））后的第十天。犹太新年的活动始于犹太新年，延续十天，到赎罪日进入高潮。犹太人在这十天中。卜悔自己的罪过，请求神给自己多一年的时间自我省察。赎罪日当天要禁食二十五小时，并虔诚祷告，通常在犹太教堂度过。】">查看中文翻译</div>
