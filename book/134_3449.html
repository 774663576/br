<div class="line_en">Therese started to get dressed, then changed her mind. She was still in her robe, reading the script of Small Rain that Phil had brought over earlier, and that was now spread all over the couch. Carol had said she was at Forty-eighth and Madison. She could be here in ten minutes.</div>

<div class="line_en">She took some ash trays to the sink and washed them, and stacked the play script neatly on her worktable. She wondered if Carol would have her new handbag with her. Carol had called her last night from some place in New Jersey where she was with Abby, had told her she thought the bag was beautiful but much too grand a present. Therese smiled, remembering Carol's suggesting that she take it back. At least, Carol liked it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她把几个烟灰缸拿到洗手台洗，然后把剧本整齐堆好放在工作桌上，猜想卡罗尔会不会带着她的新手提包来。卡罗尔昨晚和艾比在一起，从新泽西州打电话给她，而且告诉她说那个手提包很漂亮，但当作礼物来送太贵重了。特芮丝想起卡罗尔建议她把包退回去，不禁笑了出来。至少卡罗尔很喜欢那个包。">查看中文翻译</div>

"I had to take a present to a friend of Mamma's. This is lebkuchen." He nodded at the box and smiled, disarmingly. "Anybody want some now?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我刚好在附近，所以我就上来了。”他说。在他的话中，特芮丝听到他不自觉地带着一种维护自己权利的腔调。她刚刚也看见了，理查德好奇地看了卡罗尔一会儿之后，立即对卡罗尔产生了不信任的感觉。“我到这附近拿礼物给妈妈的朋友。这是姜饼。”他点头指向那盒子，放下戒心似地笑了笑。“有人想尝尝味道吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Go ahead," she answered with a brusqueness that Richard either didn't hear or ignored, because he simply lay back on the couch with the manuscript in his hands and began to read. She picked up a book of matches from the shelf. No, he only recognized the "miles away" moods, she thought, when he felt himself deprived of her by distance. And she thought suddenly of the times she had gone to bed with him, of her distance then compared to the closeness that was supposed to be, that everyone talked about. It hadn't mattered to Richard then, she supposed, because of the physical fact they were in bed together. And it crossed her mind now, seeing Richard's complete absorption in his reading, seeing the plump, stiff fingers catch a front lock of his hair between them and pull it straight down toward his nose, as she had seen him do a thousand times before, it occurred to her Richard's attitude was that his place in her life was unassailable, her tie with him permanent and beyond question, because he was the first man she had ever slept with. Therese threw the match cover at the shelf, and a bottle of something fell over.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“去读吧。”她粗鲁地回答，理查德不是没听到就是不在乎，因为他只是往后躺在沙发上，手里拿着手稿开始读。她从架子上取下火柴，心想，只有在他感觉到两人相隔甚远，在他感觉到自己要失去她的时候，他才会明白什么是“拒人于千里之外”的感觉。她突然想起她和理查德上床的时候，想到她当时保持的疏离，以及恋人之间应有的亲密，那种大家都在谈论的两者之间的差距有多大。她想，两人同床共枕的这个事实，让理查德觉得这种疏离没什么。现在这个想法掠过她的脑海，她看见理查德完全沉浸在阅读中，厚实、僵硬的手指抓着一绺头发，头发绕在手指间，然后把头发往下拉直到鼻子，这样的情景她已经看他做过上千次了。现在再次看到，她突然想到，理查德的想法一定是他在特芮丝生命里的地位是无可取代的，他们两人的关系会长长久久，毫无疑问，因为他是第一个和她上床的男人。特芮丝把火柴丢在架子上，有瓶东西倒了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
