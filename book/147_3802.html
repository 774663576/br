<div class="line_en">He gave benediction to the words in which he had so happily defined his position as wage-earner. They stated and confirmed an attitude, and in some measure protected him against the constant betrayals of sentiment. During the Spring he worked stupendously at joining activities, knowing that here was coin whose ring they could hear. He wrote conscientiously each item of his distinctions; his name found its way back more than once to the indulgent Altamont papers. Gant kept the clippings proudly, and gave public readings when he could.</div>

<div class="line_en">During the few remaining days of his holiday, he stayed almost entirely away from the house, coming for a brief and mumbled meal, and late at night, for bed. He waited for departure as a prisoner for release. The dolorous prelude to a journey -- the wet platform eyes, the sudden radiation of hectic warmth, the declarations of love at sound of the whistle -- left him this time unmoved. The tear-ducts, he was beginning to discover, had, like sweat-glands, dermic foundations, and were easily brought to a salty sparkle at mere sight of a locomotive. He had, therefore, the somewhat detached composure of a gentleman on his way to a comfortable week-end, who stands in a noisy crowd, waiting for the ferry.</div>

<div class="line_en">The boy had two short awkward letters from Ben, who was now stationed one hundred miles away, in the tobacco town. At Easter, Eugene visited him, staying at his lodgings, where again his unerring destiny had thrown him into the welcoming arms of a gray-haired widow. She was under fifty -- a handsome silly woman, who prodded and teased him as she would an adored child. She addressed him -- with a loose giggle -- as "Old Curly-Head," at which he fetched out his usual disgusted plea to his Maker. "O my God! Listen to this!" She had reverted to an astonishing romping girlhood, and would exercise her playfulness by leaping suddenly upon Old Curly-Head, dealing him a stiff dig in the ribs, and skipping away with a triumphant "Hah! Got you that time!"</div>

<div class="line_en">Spring was coming on again across the earth like a light sparkle of water-spray: all of the men who had died were making their strange and lovely return in blossom and flower. Ben walked along the streets of the tobacco town looking like asphodel. It was strange to find a ghost there in that place: his ancient soul prowled wearily by the cheap familiar brick and all the young facades.</div>

<div class="line_en">"You ought to see it," Ben said. "It's a famous custom: people come from everywhere." But the older brother did not go. Behind massed bands of horns, the trumpeting blare of trombones, the big crowds moved into the strange burial ground where all the stones lay flat upon the graves -- symbol, it was said, of all-levelling Death. But as the horns blared, the old ghoul-fantasy of death returned, the grave slabs made him think of table-cloths: he felt as if he were taking part in some obscene feast.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你应该去看看，”本恩说，“这是一项非常有名的风俗，人们从四面八方涌来。”但是哥哥本恩却没有去。大队人群跟在吹吹打打的乐队后面，缓步进入墓地。这里的所有墓碑全都平放在坟茔之上——据说这象征着人人都平等的“死亡”。号声一旦响起，尤金的脑海里又会勾起那些死去的鬼魅和幻想。那一块块平躺在坟上的幕碑，使他想到了餐桌布，他觉得自己似乎正在参加一个令人作呕的盛宴。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">War is not death to young men; war is life. The earth had never worn raiment of such color as it did that year. The war seemed to unearth pockets of ore that had never been known in the nation: there was a vast unfolding and exposure of wealth and power. And somehow -- this imperial wealth, this display of power in men and money, was blended into a lyrical music. In Eugene's mind, wealth and love and glory melted into a symphonic noise: the age of myth and miracle had come upon the world again. All things were possible.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对年轻人来说，战争不是死亡，而是生活。那一年，全世界似乎都披上了迷彩服。战争似乎为美国发掘出了前所未知的矿藏，展现出无尽的财富和力量。不知以什么方式——这种帝国的财富，这种人力和物力资源，汇聚成了一曲悦耳的抒情曲。在尤金的脑海里，财富、爱情和荣耀共同融进了这首交响乐。神话和奇迹的时代又一次重返人间。任何美梦都有可能实现。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Spring advanced with a mounting hum of war. The older students fell out quietly and drifted away to enlistments. The younger strained tensely, waiting. The war brought them no sorrow: it was a pageant which might, they felt, pluck them instantly into glory. The country flowed with milk and honey. There were strange rumors of a land of Eldorado to the north, amid the war industry of the Virginia coast. Some of the students had been there, the year before: they brought back stories of princely wages. One could earn twelve dollars a day, with no experience. One could assume the duties of a carpenter, with only a hammer, a saw, and a square. No questions were asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="春天的脚步在战争的嗡嗡声中不断地朝前迈进。年纪大一些的学生都悄然退学当兵去了；年纪稍小一些的，个个神情紧张地期待着合适的时机。战争并没有给他们带来痛苦，相反，他们觉得战争就像一场能迅速带给他们荣誉的盛大演出。战争期间的美国到处呈现出繁荣富裕的景象。到处都在传言说北边弗吉尼亚沿岸一带的军火工业非常兴隆，已经成了大家淘金的黄金之地。有些同学一年前曾经去过那里，都说能在那里赚到许多钱。没有工作经验的人每天都能挣来12块钱，只要有钉锤、锯子、直尺就可以当木匠了。没有人会盘问你的底细。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Early in the morning he came to Richmond. He had to change trains; there was a wait. He went out from the station and walked up the hill toward the fine old State House drenched cleanly in the young morning light. He ate breakfast at a lunchroom on Broad Street, filled already with men going to their work. This casual and brief contact with their lives, achieved after his lonely and magnificent approach through the night, thrilled him by its very casualness. All the little ticking sounds of a city beginning its day, the strange familiarity of voices in an alien place, heard curiously after the thunder of the wheels, seemed magical and unreal. The city had no existence save that which he conferred on it: he wondered how it had lived before he came, how it would live after he left. He looked at all the men, feeding with eyes that held yet the vast moon-meadows of the night and the cool green width of the earth. They were like men in a zoo; he gazed at them, looking for all the little particular markings of the town, the fine mapping upon their limbs and faces of their own little cosmos. And the great hunger for voyages rose up in him -- to come always, as now at dawn, into strange cities, striding in among them, and sitting with them unknown, like a god in exile, stored with the enormous vision of the earth.</div>

He drove along the little decks at a bounding stride, lunging past the staring people, with wild noises in his throat. The lean destroyers, the bright mad camouflage of the freighters and the transports, the lazy red whirl of a propeller, half-submerged, and the light winey sparkle of the waves fused to a single radiance and filled him with glory.

He watched it go without fear, with a sharp quickening of his pulses, tasting the keen pleasure of his loneliness and the unknown turnings of his life. He sensed the throbbing antennae of the world: life purred like a hidden dynamo, with the vast excitement of ten thousand glorious threats. He might do all, dare all, become all. The far and the mighty was near him, around him, above him. There was no great bridge to span, no hard summit to win.

This worthy, whose name was Sinker Jordan, was three years older than Eugene. He was a handsome reckless boy, small in stature, and limping from an injury he had received in a football game.

They pooled their resources, and, with wild optimism, purchased from a pawnbroker in Newport News the rudiments of carpenter's equipment -- hammers, saws, and T-squares. They went inland fifteen or twenty miles to a dreary government camp sweltering in the Virginia pines. They were refused employment here and in black dejection returned in the afternoon to the town they had left so hopefully in the morning. Before sundown they had secured employment in the Shipbuilding Yards, but they had been discharged five minutes after they reported for work, when they confessed to a grinning foreman in a room full of woodshavings and quietly slatting belts, that they had no knowledge of the intensely special carpentry of ship's carving.

Eugene screwed up his pride and borrowed a few dollars from one of the other checkers. On this he and Sinker lived meagerly until pay-day -- which was only a few days off. This money slipped quickly through their careless fingers. Down to a few coins again, with the next pay-day almost two weeks off, Sinker gambled at dice with the checkers, behind the great fortress of sacked oats upon the pier -- lost, won, lost, rose penniless and cursing God. Eugene knelt beside the checkers, with his last half-dollar in his palm, heedless of Sinker's bitter taunt. He had never thrown dice before: naturally, he won --$8.50. He rose exultantly from their profane surprise, and took Sinker to dinner at the best hotel.</div>

The boats and trains slid in and out, crammed to the teeth with munitions -- with food for the soldiers. The hot grainy air on the pier swam before his eyes speckled with dancing patches, and he made weary tallies on a sheet as the big black stevedores swarmed past him with their trunks. Sinker Jordan cadged small sums from the other checkers, and lived miserably on bottled pop and cheese at a little grocery across the road from the pier. Eugene was unable to beg or borrow. Partly from pride, but more from the powerful brooding inertia of his temper, which more and more was governing his will to act, he found himself unable to speak. Each day he said: "I shall speak to one of them today. I shall say that I must eat, and that I have no money." But when he tried to speak he could not.</div>

<div class="line_en">As they grew more efficient in their work they were called back, after the day's end, for work at night. This extra work, with its time-and-a-half pay, he would otherwise have been glad to get, but stumbling from exhaustion, the command to return was horrible. For several days now he had not been home to the dingy little room which he shared with Sinker Jordan. At the end of his day's work, he would climb to a little oasis in the enormous wall of sacked oats and sink into exhausted sleep, with the rattling of cranes and winches, the steady rumble of the trucks, and the remote baying of boats anchored in the stream -- mixing in a strange faint symphony in his ears.</div>

To go alone, as he had gone, into strange cities; to meet strange people and to pass again before they could know him; to wander, like his own legend, across the earth -- it seemed to him there could be no better thing than that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他满怀豪情，感到非常得意。现在，他的口袋里有130块钱，都是靠自己的辛苦劳动挣来的。在这段日子里，他独立地生活着，饱尝了痛苦和饥饿的滋味，最后终于挺了过来。他渴望周游四方的夙愿此刻再一次浮上心头。他为这种神秘生活带来的荣耀而感到兴奋。对人群的惧怕、对群居生活的猜疑与憎恶，担心自己被束缚在可怕的家庭围栏里的恐怖心态，再一次唤起他对那个辽阔、孤独的理想世界的向往。一个人像他那样独来独往，走进陌生的城市，跟陌生人打交道，不等他们知道他的底细，他就起身离开了；他去到地球的各个角落去漫游，就像自己编造的传奇故事一样——对他来说，世界上再也没有比这更痛快的事了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">With quick horror, he saw that such freedom lay a weary world away, and could be bought by such enduring courage as few men have.</div>

<div class="line_en">Before he went home he wrote an enormous letter to Laura James at Norfolk, a pitiable and boasting letter which rose at its end to an insane crow: "I was there all summer and I never looked you up. You were not decent enough to answer my letters; I saw no reason why I should bother with you any more. Besides, the world is full of women; I got my share and more this summer."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在他动身回家之前，他给诺福克的劳拉·詹姆斯写了长长的一封信。这封信既令人同情又充满了自吹自擂的内容。他在信末竟然得意地写道：“我整个夏天都住在你的城市里，可是我从来没有想过要去找你。我以前曾写信给你，但你竟然连信都不回，真是太不像话了；我觉得再也没有必要打扰你了。顺便告诉你，这个世界上女人多的是，今年夏天，我就弄到了不少，我简直都无法应付了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He stayed in Richmond several days, living sumptuously in the splendid hotel, eating from silver dishes in the grill, and roaming pleasantly through the wide streets of the romantic old town, to which he had come once as a Freshman at Thanksgiving, when the university's team had played Virginia there. He spent three days trying to seduce a waitress in an ice-cream and candy-store: he lured her finally to a curtained booth in a chop-suey restaurant, only to have his efforts fail when the elaborate meal he had arranged for with the Chinaman aroused her distaste because it had onions in it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他在里奇蒙待了几天，在那家豪华旅馆里尽情享受了几天。他使用银制餐具就餐，徜徉在宽敞浪漫的古城街道上，心情感到舒畅极了。他在大一那年的感恩节期间曾经到这里来过一回，当时他的学校跟弗吉尼亚大学正在这个城市举行足球比赛。那一次他花了三天的时间，试图勾引一位在冰淇淋和糖果店上班的女服务员。他把诱饵设在一家拉着窗帘的美式中国餐馆里，事先他同餐馆的中国人精心安排了一顿丰盛的饭菜。但是由于厨师在菜里放了洋葱，令她大倒胃口，结果他的全部努力彻底前功尽弃。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He mailed the letter, with a sense of malevolent triumph. But the moment the iron lid of the box clanged over it, his face was contorted by shame and remorse: he lay awake, writhing as he recalled the schoolboy folly of it. She had beaten him again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他怀着一种得意的报复心理，把这封信寄了出去。但是就在邮筒铁盖关上的那一刹那，他的脸却羞愧得扭曲起来。他对自己的行为感到懊悔万分。当晚，他躺在床上难以入眠，翻来覆去，觉得自己竟然做出这么幼稚、这么愚蠢的举动，心里充满了不安。她又一次战胜了他。">查看中文翻译</div>
