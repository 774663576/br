<div class="line_en">"It's possible to detect the warped points using the naked eye," Chu Yan said. "But the best way is to monitor the electromagnetic radiation. The emission from these points is very faint, but it has a distinct spectral signature. The regular sensors on our ships can detect and locate them. Typically, a volume of space as large as a ship in this region contains one to two warped points, but we once found twelve at once. Look, right now there are three."</div>

<div class="line_en">In the bulkhead in front of them was a circular hole about a meter in diameter. The edge was smooth, mirrorlike. Through the hole they could see tubes of various thicknesses. Several tubes had entire sections missing in the middle. In two of the thicker tubes, they could see liquid flowing. The liquid seemed to flow from one section, disappear, and then reappear in the corresponding section of the tube on the other side. The missing sections were of different lengths, but overall seemed to describe a spherical space. Based on the shape of the missing sections, part of the invisible bubble protruded into the corridor. Morovich and Guan carefully avoided it.</div>

If the three-dimensional world were likened to a picture, all he had seen before was just a narrow view from the side: a line. Only from four-dimensional space could he see the picture as a whole. He would describe it this way: Nothing blocked whatever was placed behind it. Even the interiors of sealed spaces were laid open. This seemed a simple change, but when the world was displayed this way, the visual effect was utterly stunning. When all barriers and concealments were stripped away, and everything was exposed, the amount of information entering the viewer's eyes was hundreds of millions times greater than when he was in three-dimensional space.

But no, they were not seeing "through" anything. Everything was laid out in the open, just like when we look at a circle drawn on a piece of paper, we can see the inside of the circle without looking "through" anything. This kind of openness extended to every level, and the hardest part was describing how it applied to solid objects. One could see the interior of solids, such as the bulkheads or a piece of metal or a rock -- one could see all the cross sections at once!

<div class="line_en">Morovich and Guan had to learn to deal with an entirely novel visual phenomenon: unlimited details. In three-dimensional space, the human visual system dealt with limited details. No matter how complicated the environment or the object, the visible elements were limited. Given enough time, it was always possible to take in most of the details one by one. But when one viewed the three-dimensional world from four-dimensional space, all concealed and hidden details were revealed simultaneously, since three-dimensional objects were laid open at every level. Take a sealed container as an example: One could see not only what was inside, but also the interiors of the objects inside. This boundless disclosure and exposure led to the unlimited details on display.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，他们不得不面对一个全新的视觉现象：无限细节。在三维世界里，人类的视觉面对的是有限细节，一个环境或事物不管多么复杂，呈现的细节是有限的。只要用足够的时间依次观看，总能把绝大部分细节尽收眼底。但从四维看三维时，由于三维事物在各个层次上都暴露在四维视野中，原来封闭和被遮挡的一切都平行并列出来。比如一个封闭容器，首先可以看到它内部的物体，而这些内部物体的内都也是可见的，在这无穷层次的暴露并列中，便显露出无限的细节。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Everything in the ship lay exposed before Morovich and Guan, but even when observing some specific object, such as a cup or a pen, they saw infinite details, and the information received by their visual systems was incalculable. Even a lifetime would not be enough to take in the shape of any one of these objects in four-dimensional space. When an object was revealed at all levels in four-dimensional space, it created in the viewer a vertigo-inducing sensation of depth, like a set of Russian nesting dolls that went on without end. Bounded in a nutshell but counting oneself a king of infinite space was no longer merely a metaphor.</div>

<div class="line_en">The phrase "in parallel" might also lead to misunderstanding. The physical locations of the parts of the body had not been shifted around: The skin still enclosed the organs and the bones, and the familiar shape of each person in three-dimensional space persisted -- but it was now merely one detail among an infinity of details, visible at the same time, in parallel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但“并列”这个词同样可能引起误解，人体各部分的物理位置并没有任何变化，皮肤仍然包裹着内脏和骨骼，每个人在三维世界中的熟悉形象还在，是细节的一部分。与其他无限的细节并列在一起。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Be careful of where you move your hands," Chu Yan said. "You might poke an internal organ -- yours or someone else's -- by mistake. But as long as you don't use too much force, even contact won't be a big deal. You'll feel a bit of pain or nausea, and of course there's the risk of infections. Also, don't touch or move things unless you know exactly what they are. Everything on the ship is now naked: You might be touching a live wire or heated steam, or even integrated circuits, and cause system malfunctions. Overall, you're like gods in the three-dimensional world, but you have to get used to being in four-dimensional space before you can use your powers effectively."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你们注意手不要乱动，不小心可能会触到别人心或自已的内脏。”褚岩说。“不过只要不用力也间题不大，可能有点儿疼或恶心，有时还会造成轻微的感染。也别乱动周围的东西，除非你确实知道那是什么。现在飞船上的一切都是裸露的，你可能触到高压电缆或高温蒸汽什么的。还可能接触到集成电路，造成系统故障。总之，对于三维世界来说你们现在有神一样的力量。但必须经过一段时问对四维的适应才能使用这种力量。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After the initial vertigo, Morovich and Guan experienced another, even greater shock. Once their attention was no longer completely absorbed by the inexhaustible details of the environment around them, they sensed space itself, or sensed the fourth dimension. Later, people would call this feeling "high-dimensional spatial sense." For those who had experienced it, high-dimensional spatial sense was hard to convey in words. They often tried to explain it this way: Concepts like "vastness" or "boundlessness" in three-dimensional space were replicated an infinite number of times in four-dimensional space in a direction that did not exist in three-dimensional space. They often resorted to the analogy of two mirrors facing each other: In either mirror one could see a boundless multitude of replicated mirrors, a hall of mirrors that extended into infinity. In this analogy, each mirror in the hall was a three-dimensional space. In other words, the vastness that one experienced in three-dimensional space was but a cross-section of the vastness of four-dimensional space. The difficulty of describing high-dimensional spatial sense lay in the fact that for observers situated in four-dimensional space, the space they could see was empty and uniform, but there was a depth to it that could not be captured by language. This depth was not a matter of distance: It was bound up in every point in space. Guan Yifan's exclamation later became a classic quote: "A bottomless abyss exists in every inch."</div>

From the spaceships it was impossible to see the end points, but it was as if God had held a T-square against the plan for the universe and sketched a line straight across from left to right. Careful observation by instruments revealed that the line was close to one AU in length, or about 130 million kilometers, almost long enough to connect the Earth with the Sun. In contrast to other lines that had been observed, this one had a thickness that was visible even from several hundred thousand kilometers away. The light emitted by the line turned from a hot bluish-white to a merely warm red, and then gradually dimmed. The line itself also became twisted and loose, breaking into a belt of dust. It no longer glowed by itself, but seemed suffused with the light of the stars, a serene silver.
