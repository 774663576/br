<div class="line_en">The wall in front of Jan disappeared. Instead he was looking down from a height of a few hundred metres on to a pleasantly wooded country. The illusion was so perfect that he fought a momentary giddiness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="面前的墙壁消失了，扬发现自己正站在几百米高的地方俯视下面郁郁葱葱的森林。画面十分清晰，自己不禁有些眩晕。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yet that was the immediate impression that came to Jan's mind, and no amount of logic could dispel it. They might have been savages, engaged in some complex ritual dance. They were naked and filthy, with matted hair obscuring their eyes. As far as Jan could tell, they were of all ages from five to fifteen, yet they all moved with the same speed, precision, and complete indifference to their surroundings.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那是一群正跳着某种复杂舞蹈的原始人，这是扬的第一印象。他们全身赤裸，蓬头垢面，头发盖住了眼睛，虽然年龄在五到十五岁之间，但他们跳舞的节奏和动作以及对周围环境漠然的神情全都一模一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You are searching for something that is no longer there," said Karellen. "Remember -- they have no more identity than the cells in your own body. But linked together, they are something much greater than you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“在他们身上，你找不到你想要的东西。”卡瑞林说，“他们就像构成你身体的一个个细胞，本身没有任何特征，但只要结合起来，就比你们强得多。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then Jan saw their faces. He swallowed hard, and forced himself not to turn away. They were emptier than the faces of the dead, for even a corpse has some record carved by time's chisel upon its features, to speak when the lips themselves are dumb. There was no more emotion or feeling here than in the face of a snake or an insect. The Overlords themselves were more human than this.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着看到了他们的脸，比死人还要呆板——就算尸体，也会有岁月留下的痕迹，也会有某种表情。他们就和蛇或昆虫一样没有任何情感也没有任何感觉，和他们比起来，外星人都要有人性得多。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“他们为什么老是不停地跳舞？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We called it the Long Dance," replied Karellen. "They never sleep, you know, and this lasted almost a year. Three hundred million of them, moving in a controlled pattern over a whole continent. We've analyzed that pattern endlessly, but it means nothing, perhaps because we can see only the physical part of it -- the small portion that's here on Earth. Possibly what we have called the Overmind is still training them, moulding them into one unit before it can wholly absorb them into its being."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们称这种舞为长舞，”卡瑞林说，“他们不睡觉，不停地跳，这种状况持续已经快一年了。他们总共有三亿，跳着固定的舞蹈动作，足迹遍布整个大陆。我们一直在研究这种舞蹈，但没有任何发现，也许我们看到的只是物质的一面，只占其中很小的一部分。我们的超智慧统治者很可能还在训练他们，要把他们塑成一个整体，才真正接受他们。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Water made no difference: they could not drown. When they encountered obstacles, they sometimes damaged themselves, but they never noticed it. As for food -- well, there was all the fruit and game they required. But now they have left that need behind, like so many others. For food is largely a source of energy, and they have learned to tap greater sources."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“水没关系，他们淹不死；碰上其他障碍，他们有时可能受重伤，但他们自己不知道；至于食物——好办，他们需要的水果和猎物应有尽有。现在他们已经不再需要食物和其他的很多东西了，食物在很大程度上只是一种能量来源，而他们已经找到了更好的能量来源。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The little figures, so helpless and pathetic if one did not know the truth, stood motionless in forest and glade and plaint The camera roamed restlessly from one to the other: already, thought Jan, their faces were merging into a common mould. He had once seen some photographs made by the superposition of dozens of prints to give one "average" face. The result had been as empty, as void of character as this.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那些小小的身影一动不动地站在森林里、沼泽里和平原上。在不知内情的人看来，他们是多么可怜无助！摄像机不停地从一个身影飞到另一个身影，他们的脸好像一个模子铸出来的。扬曾见到过几十张照片叠加处理后得到的“标准脸”，就是这样一张面无表情、毫无特色的脸。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They seemed to be sleeping or entranced. Then eyes were tightly closed, and they showed no more awareness of their surroundings than did the trees under which they stood. What thoughts, Jan wondered, were echoing through the intricate network in which their minds were now no more -- and yet no less -- than the separate threads of some great tapestry? And a tapestry, he now realized, that covered many worlds and many races -- and was growing still.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们似乎睡着了，或者是着了魔，一双双眼睛紧闭着，就像遮挡着他们的树一样似乎完全没有意识到周围的一切。现在他们的思维就像织成地毯的一条条线相互交织在一起，不知道这样精细的交织中传达着怎样的思想？他现在意识到，这幅挂毯覆盖了许多世界和许多种族，而且还在继续增长。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It happened with a swiftness that dazzled the eye and stunned the brain. At one moment Jan was looking down upon a beautiful, fertile country with nothing strange about it save the countless small statues scattered -- yet not randomly -- over its length and breadth. And then in an instant all the trees and grass, all the living creatures that had inhabited this land, flickered out of existence and were gone. There were left only the still lakes, the winding rivers, the rolling brown hills, now stripped of their green carpet -- and the silent, indifferent figures who had wrought all this destruction.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然眼前一晃，扬正在吃惊，画面已经变了，刚刚还是一片青山绿水，转眼之间，所有的草木、生物全消失了，只剩下静静的湖泊，蜿蜒的江河，起伏的褐色山峦，全都没有了绿色的掩盖。还有那些制造了这一切破坏的、沉默的、漠不关心的人物。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Perhaps the presence of other minds disturbed them -- even the rudimentary minds of plants and animals. One day, we believe, they may find the material world equally distracting. And then, who knows what will happen? Now you understand why we withdrew when we had done our duty. We are still trying to study them, but we never enter their land or even send our instruments there. All we dare do is to observe from space."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“也许其他思维的存在干扰了他们，就是动植物那样低级的思维也可能。总有一天，他们会发现这个物质世界也让他们难以集中思想，谁知道那时又会发生什么事呢？为什么我们一完成任务就离开，现在你明白了吧？我们还在观察他们，只是不敢再进入他们的领地，也不敢再发送任何监视仪器，只能从空中看。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“他们为什么那样做？”扬倒吸一口气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, though that is not surprising. The-entity-of which they are part knows all about us. It does not seem to care if we attempt to study it. When it wishes us to leave, or has a new task for us elsewhere, it will make its desires very obvious. Until then, we will remain here so that our scientists can gather what knowledge they may."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对。那也没有什么好吃惊的。他们是超智慧的一部分，它知道我们，并不介意我们对他们进行研究。当它希望我们离开或者要派我们到一个新地方去执行任务时，它会明确告诉我们。在此之前，我们会继续留在这里，让科学家们多收集一些信息。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“他们一直静静地站着，纹丝不动，不论白天黑夜，酷暑严冬。他们还在尝试自己的能力，让有些河流改变了河道，甚至有一条河的河水能够流到山上去。他们目前做的这一切都没有一个明确的目的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For the road to the stars was a road that forked in two directions, and neither led to a goal that took any account of human hopes or fears.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="通往其他星球的路向两个方向延伸，没有一条通向一个目标的道路，而这一目标又没有考虑到人类的希望或恐惧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yet it was fitting: it had the sublime inevitability of a great work of art. Jan had glimpsed the universe in all its awful immensity, and knew now that it was no place for man. He realized at last how vain, in the ultimate analysis, had been the dream that had lured him to the stars.</div>

<div class="line_en">At the end of one path were the Overlords. They had preserved their individually, their independent egos; they possessed self-awareness and the pronoun "I" had a meaning in their language. They had emotions, some at least of which were shared by humanity. But they were trapped, Jan realized now, in a cul-de-sac from which they could never escape. Their minds were ten -- perhaps a hundred -- times as powerful as men's. It made no difference in the final reckoning. They were equally helpless, equally overwhelmed by the unimaginable complexity of a galaxy of a hundred thousand million suns, and a cosmos of a hundred thousand million galaxies.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一条路通向这些外星人，他们保留了独特的个性、独立的个体和强烈的自我意识，“我”这个词在他们的语言中还有意义。他们有感情，甚至有些感情和人类是一样的，但他们走进了无法逃避的死胡同，困住了。他们的智力高出人类十倍百倍，还是避免不了这样的结局。他们也同样无助，同样不了解几兆个恒星构成的复杂星系，更别提几兆个星系构成的宇宙了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So this, thought Jan, with a resignation that lay beyond all sadness, was the end of man. It was an end that no prophet had ever foreseen -- an end that repudiated optimism and pessimism alike.</div>

<div class="line_en">He never learned the full story of the strange symbiosis between the Overmind and its servants. According to Rasha- verak, there had never been a time in his races history when the Overmind was not there, though it had made no use of them until they had achieved a scientific civilization and could range through space to do its bidding.</div>

<div class="line_en">And at the end of the other path? There lay the Overmind, whatever it might be, bearing the same relation to man as man bore to amoeba. Potentially infinite, beyond mortality, how long had it been absorbing race after race as it spread across the stars? Did it too have desires, did it have goals it sensed dimly yet might never attain? Now it had drawn into its being all that the human race had ever achieved. This was not tragedy, but fulfillment. The billions of transient sparks of consciousness that had made up humanity would flicker no more like fireflies against the night. But they had not lived utterly in vain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="另一条路的终点呢？那就是超智慧。不管它是什么，它和人的关系就像人和变形虫的关系。它有无穷的能力，不会死亡，并且还继续在星际间发展壮大，接受一个又一个的种族，这样的历史有多久呢？它有欲望吗？它有自己永远也无法实现的目标吗？现在它吸收了人类发展的一切成就，这不是悲剧，而是圆满。人类数十亿点智慧的火花就像黑夜里的萤火虫一样不起眼，但人类没有白活。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He understood their purpose now, what they had done with Man and why they still lingered upon Earth. Towards them he felt a great humility, as well as admiration for the inflexible patience that had kept them waiting here so long.</div>

<div class="line_en">"No," said Rashaverak, "it has limits. In the past, we know, it has attempted to act directly upon the minds of other races, and to influence their cultural development. It's always failed, perhaps because the gulf is too great. We are the interpreters -- the guardians. Or, to use one of your own metaphors, we till the field until the crop is ripe. The Overmind collects the harvest -- and we move on to another task. This is the fifth race whose apotheosis we have watched. Each time we learn a little more."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不。”瑞沙维莱克说，“它也有局限。我们知道，它过去试图直接影响其他种族的思想，影响他们的文化发展，都失败了，也许是因为它的拉力太大了，因此我们就作了处在中间的监护人，用你们的一个比喻就是我们耕种，它收获。完成了一个任务，我们马上又要去执行下一个任务了，你们是我们观察的第五个种族。每次我们都能对它多了解一点。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"When our ships entered your skies a century and a half ago, that was the first meeting of our two races, though of course we had studied you from a distance. And yet you feared and recognized us, as we knew that you would. It was not precisely a memory. You have already had proof that time is more complex than your science ever imagined. For that memory was not of the past, but of the future -- of those closing years when your race knew that everything was finished. We did what we could, but it was not an easy end. And because we were there, we became identified with your race's death. Yes, even while it was still ten thousand years in the future! It was as if a distorted echo had reverberated round the closed circle of time, from the future to the past. Call it not a memory, but a premonition."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“一百五十年前，我们的飞船出现在你们的空中，我们两个种族正式见面，事实上我们已经在远处观察你们很久了。你们害怕我们，认出了我们，正如我们预料的那样，严格来说，你们的那种记忆不是一种记忆。你已经知道，时间比你们知道的要复杂得多，记忆也是如此。你们那种记忆不是对过去，而是对将来的记忆，是对你们知道自己末日就要来临的最后几年的记忆。我们千方百计想让你们忘记，可没那么容易，因为你们种族灭亡的时候，我们在场，我们总是和你们的灭亡联系在一起。这种记忆就像回声沿着一个首尾相连的圈又转回来了，从未来到了过去，只是声音可能有些失真。所以最好不要叫它记忆，叫先验更合适。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was plenty to occupy his mind. The Overlords' base was about a kilometre from a deserted villa, and Jan spent months fitting this out with equipment he had taken from the nearest town, some thirty kilometres distant. He had flown there with Rashaverak, whose friendship, he suspected, was not completely altruistic. The Overlord psychologist was still studying the last specimen of Homo sapiens.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他还有很多事要做。距离外星人基地不远有一座废弃的别墅，扬花了好几个月时间才收拾出来，然后又和瑞沙维莱克一起从三十公里以外的镇上搬来各种用品。瑞沙维莱克还在研究这个最后的人类。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That final act, before the curtain came down for ever, must have been lit by flashes of heroism and devotion, darkened by savagery and selfishness. Whether it had ended in despair or resignation, Jan would never know.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在幕布永远落下之前，这最后一幕一定是由英雄主义和献身精神的闪光照亮的，而这些光辉又被野蛮和自私所遮蔽。人类究竟是在悲观绝望，还是在无可奈何中结束的呢？扬不得而知。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Often he would go for long walks on the hills, thinking of all that had happened in the few months since he had last seen Earth. He had never thought, when he said goodbye to Sullivan eighty terrestrial years ago, that the last generation of mankind was already in the womb.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="扬经常到山上很远的地方去散步，思考自己离开地球后发生的事情。他当初和萨利文告别的时候，照地球上的时间看，那是八十年之前了，他压根儿没有想到最后一代人类已经在孕育之中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was everything here that he needed to maintain himself for the rest of his life, but what he wanted most was an electronic piano and certain Bach transcriptions. He had never had as much time for music as he would have liked, and now he would make up for it. When he was not performing himself, he played tapes of the great symphonies and concertos, so that the villa was never silent. Music had become his talisman against the loneliness which, one day, must surely overwhelm him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的余生衣食无忧，此时他最想要的是一台电子琴和一些巴赫的曲谱。以前一直没有足够的时间弹琴，现在终于有了。不弹琴的时候，他就放一些著名的交响乐曲和协奏曲磁带，不让别墅显得过于冷清。音乐成了他战胜孤独的法宝，但总有一天，孤独会击败自己。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The town must have been evacuated before the end, for the houses and even many of the public services were still in good order. It would have taken little work to restart the generators, so that the wide streets glowed once more with the illusion of life. Jan toyed with the idea, then abandoned it as too morbid. The one thing he did not wish to do was to brood upon the past.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在末日到来之前，人们一定撤出了这个小镇，所有的房屋，甚至许多的公用设施都还完好如初，完全可以不费吹灰之力就重新启动那些发电机，让宽阔的街道再次亮起来，让小镇重新拥有生气。扬犹豫再三，还是放弃了，这是一种病态的想法，自己现在最不想做的事就是回忆过去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">What a young fool he had been! Yet he was not sure that he regretted his action; had he stayed on Earth, he would have witnessed those closing years over which time had now drawn a veil. Instead, he had leap-frogged past them into the future, and had learned the answers to questions that no other man would ever know. His curiosity was almost satisfied, but sometimes he wondered why the Overlords were waiting, and what would happen when their patience was at last rewarded.</div>

<div class="line_en">But most of the time, with a contented resignation that comes normally to a man only at the end of a long and busy life, he sat before the keyboard and filled the air with his beloved Bach. Perhaps he was deceiving himself, perhaps this was some merciful trick of the mind, but now it seemed to Jan that this was what he had always wished to do. His secret ambition had at last dared to emerge into the full light of consciousness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但大多数时候，他都坐在钢琴旁，弹着琴，就像一个人度过了繁忙而漫长的岁月终于退休了一样心满意足，这也许是在自欺欺人，也许是某种精神上的幻觉，但扬认为这就是自己一直想做的事。">查看中文翻译</div>
