<div class="line_en">Since I last saw you I have decided to take that job I was telling you about, with Sledgehammer Theatre Co-operative and for the last four months we have been devising, rehearsing and touring with "Cruel Cargo", an Arts Council-funded spectacular about the slave-trade told through the medium of story, folk song and some pretty shocking mime. I have enclosed a crudely photocopied leaflet so that you can see what a classy number it really is.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="上次和你见面后，我便决定接受长锤联合剧团的那份工作（我跟你提过）。过去的四个月我们一直在为新剧《惨烈的货物》作策划、排练，以及巡演。这是一项大制作，由艺术委员会赞助，它通过故事、民歌和震撼人心的哑剧表演展现当年的奴隶贸易。我在信里附了一张未经修饰的剧照，你看它有多精彩。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Cruel Cargo is a TIE piece (that's Theatre-in-Education to you) aimed at 11-13-year-olds that takes the provocative view that slavery was a Bad Thing. I play Lydia, the, um, well, yes, the LEAD ROLE as a matter of fact, the spoilt and vain daughter of the wicked Sir Obadiah Grimm (can you tell from his name that he's not very nice?) and in the show's most powerful moment I come to realise that all my pretty things, all my dresses (indicate dress) and jewels (likewise) are bought with the blood of my fellow human beings (sob-sob) and that I feel dirty (stare at hands as if SEEING THE BLOOD) dirty to my SOOOOOOUUUUL. It's very powerful stuff, though ruined last night by some kids throwing Maltesers at my head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="《惨烈的货物》是一出“寓教戏”（边看戏边接受教育的意思），观众群为十一到十三岁的孩子。它义愤填膺地向孩子们灌输奴隶制度是“坏东西”的思想。我饰演的角色叫莉迪娅，嗯，是的，的确算是“领衔主演”。她是邪恶的奥巴蒂亚·格里姆先生的女儿，一个娇生惯养的虚荣女孩。听她爸的名字就不像是个好人吧？全剧最震撼的时刻是，我开始认识到自己所拥有的一切漂亮物件、衣裙（伸手指裙子）和珠宝（相似的动作）原来都是用人的血汗换来的（抽泣），我感到自己肮脏（盯着双手，好似看到了淋淋鲜血），来自灵—魂的肮脏。非常有气势的一段，可惜昨晚几个孩子往我脑袋上砸了麦提莎巧克力，把这么好的戏给毁了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There are four of us in the cast. Kwame is the Noble Slave and despite us playing mistress and servant we actually get along alright (though I asked him to get me a packet of crisps in this café the other day and he looked at me like I was OPPRESSING him or something). But he's nice and serious about the work, though he did cry a lot in rehearsals, which I thought was a bit much. He's a bit of a weeper, if you know what I mean. In the play there's meant to be this powerful sexual tension between us, but once again life is failing to imitate art.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="本剧有四个角色。夸梅饰演高尚的奴隶，剧中我们是小姐和仆人，但在剧外相处得还不错（只是有一次我让他帮我从咖啡店带一包薯条时，他看我的眼神好像受到我压迫）。他工作态度端正、认真，只不过排练时也哭得很投入，我以为这就有点过了。他是个泪人儿，你明白我的意思吧？在剧里，我们之间存在一种强烈的性吸引，不过此处生活和艺术又完全是两码事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But seriously, actually, it's not as bad as that, not in context, and I don't know why I'm being cynical, defence-mechanism probably. We actually get a great response from the kids who see it, the ones that don't throw stuff, and we do these workshops in schools that are just really exciting. It's staggering how little these kids know about their cultural heritage, even the West Indian kids, about where they come from. I've enjoyed writing it too and it's given me lots of ideas for other plays and stuff. So I think it's worthwhile even if you think I'm wasting my time. I really, really think we can change things, Dexter. I mean they had loads of radical theatre in Germany in the Thirties and look what a difference that made. We're going to banish colour prejudice from the West Midlands, even if we have to do it one child at a time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过说正经的，其实它不至于像我形容的那么糟，我也不知道自己为何这么冷嘲热讽的，多半是自我保护意识作祟。其实小观众们的反应良好—那些没扔东西的孩子都觉得不错。我们还在学校里开设了相关的讨论课，这一活动实在是相当令人振奋。孩子们对文化传统的了解之少让人惊愕。即便是西印度群岛人的后裔，对自己的根也知之甚少。写这些事情我是乐在其中的，它们让我得以认识不少其他戏剧和事物。所以，纵使你以为我做这些是在浪费时间，我还是觉得值得。德克斯，我由衷地认为我们真的可以有所作为，有所革新。我是说，德国三十年代建立了众多激进剧场，瞧瞧现在它们的斐然成绩。而我们要做的，就是在西米德兰区消除肤色歧视，哪怕一次只能影响一个孩子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And then there's Candy, ah Candy. You'd like Candy, she's exactly what she sounds like. She plays Cheeky Maid, a Plantation Owner and Sir William Wilberforce, and is very beautiful and spiritual and even though I don't approve of the word, a complete bitch. She keeps asking me how old I am really and telling me I look tired or that if I got contact lenses I could actually be quite pretty, which I ADORE of course. She's very keen to make it clear that she's only doing this to get her Equity card and bide her time until she's spotted by some Hollywood producer who presumably just happens to be passing through Dudley on a wet Tuesday afternoon on the lookout for hot TIE talent. Acting is rubbish, isn't it? When we started STC (Sledgehammer Theatre Co-operative) we were really keen to set up a progressive theatrical collective with none of that ego-fame-getting-on-the-telly-ego-showing-off bullshit, and just do really good, exciting original political devised work. That may all sound dopey to you, but that's what we wanted to do. But the problem with democratic egalitarian collectives is that you have to listen to twots like Sid and Candy. I wouldn't mind if she could act but her Geordie accent is unbelievable, like she's had a stroke or something and she's also got this thing about doing yoga warm-ups in her lingerie. There, that's got your attention, hasn't it? It's the first time I've seen someone do the Sun Worship in hold-up stockings and a basque. That can't be right, can it? Poor old Sid can barely chew his curried beef slice, keeps missing his mouth. When the time finally comes for her to put some clothes on and go on stage one of the kids usually wolf-whistles or something and in the mini-bus afterwards she always pretends to be really affronted and feminist about it. "I hate being judged on my looks all my life I've been judged on my exquisite face and firm young body," she says as she adjusts her suspender belt, like it's a big POLITICAL issue, like we should be doing agit-prop street theatre about the plight of women cursed with great tits. Am I ranting? Are you in love with her yet? Maybe I'll introduce you when you get back. I can see you now, giving her that look where you clench your jaw and play with your lips and ask about her careeeeeer. Maybe I won't introduce you after all…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="另一位是糖糖，啊，糖糖。你会喜欢这个人如其名的糖糖。她扮演无耻的女仆，还要反串一位农场主和威廉·威伯福斯爵士。她脱俗而美丽，而且绝对是个贱人，尽管我对这个词很不以为然。她会反复地问我的实际年龄，说我面色憔悴，又或者告诉我一副隐形眼镜会让我变得多漂亮，这倒是叫我神往的。她的言行急切地表明她当前所做的一切只是为了换得一张专业演员的资格卡，同时等待某位好莱坞制片人的垂青。这伯乐想必是专程来达德利区发掘“寓教戏”天才的。唉，演戏真不是什么正经事，对吗？我们创办“长联团”（长锤联合剧团）的出发点，的确是打造一个积极进步的演出团体，而且要杜绝“自恋、邀名、追求上镜、再自恋、炫耀”的歪风邪气，专心地推出优秀、振奋、融入政治理念的原创作品。你大概会觉得这些都无聊愚蠢，然而这的确是我们想做的。一个民主、平等的集体也免不了出问题：忍受希德和糖糖的闲言闲语。他们若能演好戏我倒也可以不去计较，但糖糖的北英格兰口音真是没救了，听起来就跟她中了风似的。她还喜欢穿着内衣做瑜伽热身活动。这一定吊起你的胃口了，对吧？我长这么大还是头一次见到穿着吊带丝袜和紧身胸衣膜拜太阳的。一定哪儿有问题，是不是？这个时候可怜的希德会正吃咖喱牛肉片，见此光景必定忘了动嘴。终于要上台，糖糖穿戴好登台，大多会引来台下某个孩子吹口哨起哄。演出过后上了小型巴士，她又会为此装出一副备受侮辱的女权主义者的姿态。“我讨厌他们以貌取人，从小到大我精致的脸蛋、紧实的身材就一直被人盯着看。”她边说边调整吊袜带，好像说的是什么重大政治议题，倒像我们应该在街头剧场上演政治教育片，展示受大乳房困扰的妇女的境遇。我是不是有点粗俗？听完你有没有爱上她？等你回来也许我会介绍你们认识。我这会儿都能想象出你的样子，紧收着下巴打量着她，一边撮弄着嘴唇询问她的事—业。也许我到底不会这么做……">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then there's Sid, who plays my wicked father Obadiah. I know your whole childhood was spent playing French cricket on a bloody great chamomile lawn and you never did anything as déclassé as watch the telly, but Sid used to be quite famous, on this cop show called City Beat and his disgust at being reduced to THIS shines through. He flatly refuses to mime, like it's beneath him to be seen with an object that isn't really there, and every other sentence begins "when I was on telly" which is his way of saying "when I was happy". Sid pees in washbasins and has these scary polyester trousers which you WIPE DOWN instead of washing and subsists on service station minced beef pasties, and me and Kwame think he's secretly really racist, but apart from that he's a lovely man, a lovely, lovely man.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="希德扮演我邪恶的爸爸奥巴蒂亚。我可以想见你整个童年都泡在美得要死的甘菊花大草坪上玩法式板球，从来也不会接触任何有失地位的事，比如看电视之类的。可你知道吗，希德曾经因出演警匪剧《都市巡警》而颇有名气，所以对于自己沦落到这个剧组的厌恶之情溢于言表。他断然拒绝表演哑剧，似乎那样一来就会遭到某样子虚乌有的东西从下面窥视他。而且他开口闭口“当初我拍电视剧的时候”，实则是在说“当初我过开心日子的时候”。他还会在脸盆里撒尿。另外，他穿的涤纶裤子也很恐怖—免洗，“抹一把”就干净。他常吃的则是加油站里卖的牛肉饼。我和夸梅都觉得他私下其实就是个种族主义者，撇开这些，他便是个可爱的男人，真的很可爱。">查看中文翻译</div>

Beyond him sat Kwame, topless and forlorn in tattered trousers, hands jammed in his armpits, head lolling back, meditating or trying not to cry perhaps. On Emma's left, Candy sang songs from Les Miserables in a light, flat soprano, picking at the hammer toes she'd got from eighteen years of ballet. Emma turned back to her reflection in the cracked mirror, plumped up the puffed sleeves of her Empire line dress, removed her spectacles and gave a Jane Austen sigh.</div>

<div class="line_en">The much-advertised Second Summer of Love had been one of melancholy and lost momentum. Even her beloved Edinburgh had started to bore and depress her. Living in her University town felt like staying on at a party that everyone else had left, and so in October she had given up the flat in Rankeillor Street and moved back to her parents for a long, fraught, wet winter of recriminations and slammed doors and afternoon TV in a house that now seemed impossibly small. "But you've got a double-first! What happened to your double-first?" her mother asked daily, as if Emma's degree was a super-power that she stubbornly refused to use. Her younger sister, Marianne, a happily married nurse with a new baby, would come round at nights just to gloat at mum and dad's golden girl brought low.</div>

<div class="line_en">But every now and then, there was Dexter Mayhew. In the last few warm days of the summer after graduation she had gone to stay at his family's beautiful house in Oxfordshire; not a house, but a mansion to her eyes. Large, 1920s, with faded rugs and large abstract canvases and ice in the drinks. In the large, herb-scented garden they had spent a long, languid day between the swimming pool and tennis court, the first she'd ever seen that had not been built by the local council. Drinking gin and tonics in wicker chairs, looking at the view, she had thought of The Great Gatsby. Of course she had spoiled it; getting nervous and drinking too much at dinner, shouting at Dexter's father -- a mild, modest, perfectly reasonable man -- about Nicaragua, while all the time Dexter regarded her with a look of affectionate disappointment, as if she were a puppy who had soiled a rug. Had she really sat at their table, eating their food and calling his father a fascist? That night she lay in the guest bedroom, dazed and remorseful, waiting for a knock on the door that clearly would never come; romantic hopes sacrificed for the Sandinistas, who were unlikely to be grateful.</div>

<div class="line_en">And then he was off travelling again, broadening his mind yet further. China had turned out to be too alien and ideological for Dexter's taste, and he had instead embarked on a leisurely year-long tour of what the guide books called "Party Towns". So they were pen pals now, Emma composing long, intense letters crammed with jokes and underlining, forced banter and barely concealed longing; two-thousand-word acts of love on air-mail paper. Letters, like compilation tapes, were really vehicles for unexpressed emotions and she was clearly putting far too much time and energy into them. In return, Dexter sent her postcards with insufficient postage: "Amsterdam is MAD", "Barcelona INSANE", "Dublin ROCKS. Sick as DOG this morning." As a travel writer, he was no Bruce Chatwin, but still she would slip the postcards in the pocket of a heavy coat on long soulful walks on Ilkley Moor, searching for some hidden meaning in "VENICE COMPLETELY FLOODED!!!!".</div>

<div class="line_en">Then Gary Nutkin had phoned, the skinny Trotskyist who had directed her in a stark, uncompromising production of Brecht's Fears and Miseries of the Third Reich back in 1986, then kissed her for three stark, uncompromising hours at the last-night party. Shortly afterwards he had taken her to a Peter Greenaway double-bill, waiting until four hours in before reaching across and absent-mindedly placing his hand on her left breast as if adjusting a dimmer switch. They made Brechtian love that evening in a stale single bed beneath a poster for The Battle of Algiers, Gary taking care throughout to ensure that he was in no way objectifying her. Then nothing, not a word, until that late-night phone-call in May, and the hesitant words, softly spoken: "How would you like to join my theatre co-operative?"</div>

His room in the Centro Storico was dull and institutional, but there was at least a balcony, a foot-wide sill overlooking a picturesque square that, in a very Roman way, also functioned as a car park.

<div class="line_en">They kissed again, and he wondered vaguely if there was some moral or ethical dimension to this situation. Of course the time to worry about the pros and cons of sleeping with a student would have been after the College party, while Tove was perching unsteadily on the edge of his bed and unzipping her knee-length boots. Even then, in the muddle of red wine and desire he had found himself wondering what Emma Morley would say. Even as Tove twirled her tongue in his ear, he had conducted his defence: she's nineteen, an adult, and anyway I'm not a real teacher. Besides, Emma was a long way away at this moment, changing the world from a mini-bus on the ring road of a provincial town, and what was all this to do with Emma anyway? Tove's knee-length boots sagged in the corner of the room now, in the hostel where overnight visitors were strictly forbidden.</div>

<div class="line_en">But in the middle of this humid July afternoon, the only sound came from the wheels of tourist suitcases rumbling on the cobbles below, and they lay with the windows wide open, kissing lazily, her hair clinging to his face, thick and dark and smelling of some Danish shampoo: artificial pine and cigarette smoke. She reached across his chest for the packet on the floor, lit two cigarettes and passed him one, and he shuffled up onto the pillows, letting the cigarette dangle from his lip like Belmondo or someone in a Fellini film. He had never seen a Belmondo or Fellini film, but was familiar with the postcards: stylish, black and white. Dexter didn't like to think of himself as vain, but there were definitely times when he wished there was someone on hand to take his photograph.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而在这个七月的潮湿午后，传来的唯有楼下游客的旅行箱滑轮在鹅卵石上的滚动声。他们俩躺在地上慵懒地接着吻，一任窗户开着。她厚厚的深色头发贴在颊上，散发出好似丹麦洗发水的气味，那是人工松香和香烟混合物的味道。她伸手越过他的胸，摸到地上的烟盒，点了两支，一支递给他。他头靠在枕上，烟松松地叼在嘴边，有点贝尔蒙多或者费里尼电影中人物的派头。这两个人的电影他从未看过，不过对相关的明信片倒是很熟悉，时髦、黑白的调子。德克斯特并不乐意承认自己是个虚荣的人，不过偶尔的确希望能有人随时为他照相。">查看中文翻译</div>

Fifteen years her elder, tall, long-faced and introverted, Stephen Mayhew seemed unable to believe this one remarkable piece of good fortune. At her frequent parties, if Dexter sat very quietly so as not to be sent to bed, he would watch as the men formed an obedient, devoted circle around her; intelligent, accomplished men, doctors and lawyers and people who spoke on the radio, reduced to moony teenage boys. He would watch as she danced to early Roxy Music albums, a cocktail glass in her hand, woozy and self-contained as the other wives looked on, dumpy and slow-witted in comparison. School-friends too, even the cool complicated ones, would turn into cartoons around Alison Mayhew, flirting with her while she flirted back, engaging her in water fights, complimenting her on her terrible cooking -- the violently scrambled eggs, the black pepper that was ash from a cigarette.</div>

<div class="line_en">She had once studied fashion in London but these days ran a village antiques shop, selling expensive rugs and chandeliers to genteel Oxford with great success. She still carried with her that aura of having been something-in-the-Sixties -- Dexter had seen the photographs, the clippings from faded colour supplements -- but with no apparent sadness or regret she had given this up for a resolutely respectable, secure, comfortable family life. Typically, it was as if she had sensed exactly the right moment to leave the party. Dexter suspected that she had occasional flings with the doctors, the lawyers, the people who spoke on the radio, but he found it hard to be angry with her. And always people said the same thing -- that he had got it from her. No-one was specific about what "it" was, but everyone seem to know; looks of course, energy and good health, but also a certain nonchalant self-confidence, the right to be at the centre of things, on the winning team.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她曾在伦敦学过时装，不过现在经营的是一爿乡间古董店，向附庸风雅的牛津人出售昂贵的挂毯和枝形吊灯，生意颇为红火。她身上依然带有“六十年代风光过”的气息（德克斯特见过一些照片，是老报纸副刊的退色剪报），但没有流露一丝为了拥有一个安稳、舒适、体面尊贵的家而牺牲了它的伤感或后悔。她好像总是会精确地拿捏从派对上开溜的时机。德克斯特怀疑她偶尔和医生、律师或电台主持人偷欢，却又发现自己并不因此生气。很多人不约而同地说，他继承了母亲的“什么”，却没点明到底是什么，不过似乎人人心知肚明。美貌自不必说，健康的体魄之外还有一种目中无人的自信，一种非我莫属、众星捧月的感觉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Even now, as she sat in her washed-out blue summer dress, fishing in her immense handbag for matches, it seemed as if the life of the Piazza revolved around her. Shrewd brown eyes in a heart-shaped face under a mess of expensively dishevelled black hair, her dress undone one button too far, an immaculate mess. She saw him approach and her face cracked with a wide smile.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就看此刻穿着件洗得发白的蓝夏装坐在桌旁的她，伸出手在巨大的手袋里摸索着火柴，顾盼之间便好像整个广场都在围着她打转。一双机敏的褐色眸子嵌在瓜子脸上，蓬乱黑发是发型师昂贵的刻意之作，而套装则少扣了一个扣子，敞在那儿。真是一副完美的凌乱尊容。她望着儿子走近，脸上绽开一团微笑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“记者倒有可能。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Of course what he really wanted was to be a photographer. At sixteen he had completed a photo-project called "Texture", full of black and white close-ups of tree bark and sea-shells which had apparently "blown" his art teacher's mind. Nothing that he had done since had given him as much satisfaction as "Texture" and those high-contrast prints of frost on windows and the gravel in the driveway. Journalism would mean grappling with difficult stuff like words and ideas, but he thought he might have the makings of a decent photographer, if only because he felt he had a strong sense of when things looked right. At this stage in his life, his main criterion for choosing a career was that it should sound good in a bar, shouted into a girl's ear, and there was no denying that "I'm a professional photographer" was a fine sentence, almost up there with "I report from war zones" or "actually, I make documentaries."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的确想做的当然是摄影师。十六岁就完成了一组名为“质感”的作品，全部是黑白特写的树皮和海贝，让艺术老师受了一番“震撼”，此外还有对比强烈的玻璃窗上的霜花以及车道上的粗砾石，此后的作品他都不再满意。从事记者工作就意味着在类似文字和创意一类难缠的事物之间挣扎。不过他认为自己有摄影的天分，唯一依据大概是：他有捕捉事物最佳状态的能力。眼下他选择职业的主要标准就是要在酒吧里有面子。贴着女孩子的耳朵大声喊上一句“我是专业摄影师”无疑是体面的，若能再来一句“我做一线战地新闻”，或者“其实，我是做纪录片的”，就是锦上添花了。">查看中文翻译</div>

"Or are you going to continue your work on Texture!" and they had to stop while she stood in the street laughing for some time, doubled over, holding onto his arm for support -- "All those pictures of gravel!" -- until finally it was over, and she stood and straightened her face. "Dexter, I am so, so sorry…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哪种摄影师？《Glamour》杂志？”她压抑着笑，“还是继续‘质感’系列？”然后立在街心止不住地笑起来，他也停下了脚步。她笑弯了腰，钩住他的胳膊撑住自己。“还有那些碎石头的照片！”笑声终于止住，她站直了身子，恢复了郑重的表情，“德克斯特，实在实在对不起……”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I know you are, I'm sorry. I apologise." They began to walk again. "You must do it, Dexter, if that's what you want." She squeezed his arm with her elbow, but Dexter felt sulky. "We've always told you that you can be anything you want to be, if you work hard enough."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我理解你的感受。对不起，我道歉。”他们继续前行。“既然那是你想做的，德克斯特，就一定要努力去做。”她用臂弯夹了夹他的胳膊，然而他却心情低落。“我们一向对你说，只要下的功夫够，就一定能实现追求。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes, well, sometimes I wonder if you have a little too much to fall back on." She was looking down as she spoke and the remark seemed to rebound off the flagstones. They walked a little further before he spoke.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没错，但有时我琢磨着，你是不是有太多东西可以靠。”她说话的时候眼望着地，似乎应答会从石板路上反弹上来。他们又向前走了一阵子，他才开口。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“什么意思？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, I just mean --" She sighed, and rested her head against his shoulder. "I just mean that at some point you'll have to get serious about life, that's all. You're young and healthy and you look nice enough, I suppose, in a low light. People seem to like you, you're smart, or smart enough, not academically maybe, but you know what's what. And you've had luck, so much luck, Dexter, and you've been protected from things, responsibility, money. But you're an adult now, and one day things might not be this…" She looked around her, indicating the scenic little back street down which he had brought her. "… this serene. It would be good if you were prepared for that. It would do you good to be better equipped."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，我的意思不过是……”她叹了口气，脑袋倚在他的肩膀上，“我只是说，早晚有一天，你得严肃地面对生活，就是这么回事儿。你现在年轻、健康、不乏帅气，我认为是，尤其是在昏暗的灯光下。你还挺有人缘，挺聪明，或者说够聪明，也许不是做学问的料，但懂得人情事理。运气也还好，相当好，德克斯特。你得到了各种呵护，也不缺钱。不过你现在是成年人了，有一天生活可能会改变……”她环视了一下，指着被他一路引领走过的观光小街，“……这份宁静呵。准备好总不会有错。武装好自己。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Alison unlooped her arm and took her son's hand in hers. "Take me for lunch tomorrow, will you? While your father sits in a darkened room and picks his corns.
