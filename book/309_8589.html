<div class="line_en">Every minute, every hour, there was worry, or more to the point, paranoia. Criminal activity will do that to a person, especially a child. They envision a prolific assortment of caughtoutedness. Some examples: People jumping out of alleys. Schoolteachers suddenly being aware of every sin you've ever committed. Police showing up at the door each time a leaf turns or a distant gate slams shut.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="担忧，更准确地说是妄想，无时无刻不在纠缠着她。偷窃会让人们，尤其是孩子沉溺于这种情绪中。他们会想象出各式各样的被逮到的情景。随便举几个例子：人们会从巷子里跳出来抓住你；学校里的老师会突然发现你犯下的每一桩罪行；每一次关门声响起，每一片叶子落地，都可能会有警察现身敲响大门。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For Liesel, the paranoia itself became the punishment, as did the dread of delivering some washing to the mayor's house. It was no mistake, as I'm sure you can imagine, that when the time came, Liesel conveniently overlooked the house on Grande Strasse. She delivered to the arthritic Helena Schmidt and picked up at the cat-loving Weingartner residence, but she ignored the house belonging to Burgermeister Heinz Hermann and his wife, Ilsa.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对莉泽尔来说，这种妄想已经成了对她偷书的惩罚，去镇长家送衣物也成了一种惩罚。所以你肯定可以想象，提着衣服出门的时候，她绝对不是因为粗心大意才漏过了格兰德街上的那栋房子。她去了患关节炎的海伦娜·施密特家，拜访了爱猫如命的魏因加特纳，却偏偏忘了那栋属于“Bürgermeister”海因茨·赫尔曼和他夫人伊尔莎的宅邸。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On the first occasion, she stated that she simply forgot about that place -- a poor excuse if ever I've heard one -- as the house straddled the hill, overlooking the town, and it was unforgettable. When she went back and still returned empty-handed, she lied that there was no one home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第一次，她把失误归咎于自己的疏忽，如果让我听到这个借口，我都会觉得它太过牵强，那栋豪宅坐落在山顶上，俯瞰整座小镇，谁能把它给忘了呢。当她重新出发却再次空手而归的时候，她撒谎说那里没人在家。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No one home?" Mama was skeptical. Skepticism gave her an itch for the wooden spoon. She waved it at Liesel and said, "Get back over there now, and if you don't come home with the washing, don't come home at all."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没人在家？”妈妈的话里藏着疑虑，让她手痒地想去拿木头勺子打人。她朝莉泽尔挥了挥勺子，说：“现在再给我去一趟，如果不带着脏衣服回来，你就别回家了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“反正我现在也饿得够呛！”他们都笑了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They walked the town as they usually did when Rudy came along. He always tried to be a gentleman and carry the bag, but each time, Liesel refused. Only she had the threat of a Watschen loitering over her head, and therefore only she could be relied upon to carry the bag correctly. Anyone else was more likely to manhandle it, twist it, or mistreat it in even the most minimal way, and it was not worth the risk. Also, it was likely that if she allowed Rudy to carry it for her, he would expect a kiss for his services, and that was not an option. Besides, she was accustomed to its burden. She would swap the bag from shoulder to shoulder, relieving each side every hundred steps or so.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们就像平时那样向镇上走去。鲁迪总想装绅士，提议由他来扛袋子，但每一次都被莉泽尔拒绝。如果鲁迪把它举过头顶乱甩一气，挨骂的只会是莉泽尔，因此她只能靠自己来保障袋子的周全。其他人都有可能乱拿乱甩，或者用哪怕最轻微的方式虐待它，这种险不值得冒。再说了，如果她让鲁迪帮忙扛袋子，他可能会要求莉泽尔用亲吻回报他，这种交易可不行。此外，她已经习惯了袋子的重量。每走一百来步，她就将袋子换到另一边的肩膀上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="莉泽尔只好点了点头，因为她想悄无声息地走过这座房子，好再拖延点时间。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Liesel walked on the left, Rudy the right. Rudy talked most of the time, about the last soccer match on Himmel Street, working in his father's shop, and whatever else came to mind. Liesel tried to listen but failed. What she heard was the dread, chiming through her ears, growing louder the closer they stepped toward Grande Strasse.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莉泽尔走在左边，鲁迪走在右边。大部分时间都是鲁迪在说话，从希默尔街上最近的足球赛讲到他爸爸店里的活计，或是想到什么就讲什么。莉泽尔试着倾听，却没法集中注意力。她只能听到内心的恐惧在耳边嗡鸣，随着他们靠近格兰德街而变得愈发响亮。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After the path, there were eight steps up to the main entrance of the house, and the great door was like a monster. Liesel frowned at the brass knocker.</div>

<div class="line_en">At first, she didn't look at the woman but focused on the washing bag in her hand. She examined the drawstring as she passed it over. Money was handed out to her and then, nothing. The mayor's wife, who never spoke, simply stood in her bathrobe, her soft fluffy hair tied back into a short tail. A draft made itself known. Something like the imagined breath of a corpse. Still there were no words, and when Liesel found the courage to face her, the woman wore an expression not of reproach, but utter distance. For a moment, she looked over Liesel's shoulder at the boy, then nodded and stepped back, closing the door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一开始，她只是盯着手上的洗衣袋，不敢抬头看镇长太太。她递过衣服时，女人拉开束口绳检查了一遍，然后把钱递给她。接着这位从不对她说话的镇长太太只是披着睡袍站在那里，蓬松的头发扎成一条短短的马尾。一阵风吹过，仿佛是某具看不见的尸体发出的呼吸。莉泽尔鼓起勇气看着她，她依然一句话也不说，脸上没有责备的神情，只有绝对的距离感。她越过莉泽尔扫了男孩一眼，然后点了点头，退回屋子关上了门。">查看中文翻译</div>

She ran the back of her hand along the first shelf, listening to the shuffle of her fingernails gliding across the spinal cord of each book. It sounded like an instrument, or the notes of running feet. She used both hands. She raced them. One shelf against the other. And she laughed. Her voice was sprawled out, high in her throat, and when she eventually stopped and stood in the middle of the room, she spent many minutes looking from the shelves to her fingers and back again.</div>

<div class="line_en">Liesel didn't finish the question but actually performed what she was going to ask, walking over and taking the books gently from the woman's arms. She then placed them into the missing piece in the shelf, by the slightly open window. The outside cold was streaming in.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莉泽尔没有把话说完，而是用实际行动结束了自己的疑问，她走过去，动作轻柔地从女人手里接过书。然后，她来到窗边，把书塞进书架的空当里。寒意正从窗子打开的缝隙中汩汩而入。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">To her left, she saw the woman again, standing by a large desk, still holding the small tower against her torso. She stood with a delighted crookedness. A smile appeared to have paralyzed her lips.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她向左侧看去，发现那个女人正站在一张巨大的书桌旁，身前依旧抱着那摞书。她扭曲的姿态中透出一种喜悦。一丝笑从她的嘴角浮起，似乎僵在了那里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For a moment, she considered closing it, but thought better of it. This was not her house, and the situation was not to be tampered with. Instead, she returned to the lady behind her, whose smile gave the appearance now of a bruise and whose arms were hanging slenderly at each side. Like girls' arms.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她想过把窗户关上，但考虑再三后决定放弃。这可不是她的家，而且这微妙的处境也容不得打搅。于是她回到镇长太太身边，女人脸上的笑容现在看起来像一处瘀伤，两条纤瘦的胳膊垂在身子两侧，就像女孩的胳膊一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She walked over and did it again, this time much slower, with her hand facing forward, allowing the dough of her palm to feel the small hurdle of each book. It felt like magic, like beauty, as bright lines of light shone down from a chandelier. Several times, she almost pulled a title from its place but didn't dare disturb them. They were too perfect.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她又走上前去重复了一遍先前的动作，这一次更加缓慢，手心朝前，用手掌体会每本书之间的缝隙。这种感觉像魔法，像美的体验，像枝形吊灯洒下的明亮光线。有好几次，她差点禁不住诱惑，想把书从书架上抽出来，却不敢打搅它们的安宁。它们太完美了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This time, she avoided the sore spot in the floorboards, walking the long length of the corridor, favoring the left-hand wall. When she closed the door behind her, a brass clank sounded in her ear, and with the washing next to her, she stroked the flesh of the wood. "Get going," she said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一次，她打算避开那块陈旧的地板，于是靠着左边的墙走过了长长的走廊。当她关上门时，黄铜门环发出的声音在耳中鸣响，她伸手抚了抚那扇木门。“该走了。”她对自己说道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">An awkwardness treated itself to the room, and Liesel took a final, fleeting glance at the walls of books. In her mouth, the words fidgeted, but they came out in a rush. "I should go."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尴尬之情油然而生。莉泽尔飞快地向满墙的书投去最后一眼。那句话在她嘴边打转，最后还是脱口而出。“我该走了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It took three attempts to leave.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莉泽尔犹豫再三才走出书房。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What now?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在该怎么办？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She waited in the hallway for a few minutes, but the woman didn't come, and when Liesel returned to the entrance of the room, she saw her sitting at the desk, staring blankly at one of the books. She chose not to disturb her. In the hallway, she picked up the washing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她在玄关等了几分钟，但那女人没有出来。她回到书房门口，发现镇长太太正坐在桌边，茫然地打量着一本书。她决定不再打扰，回到玄关拾起了要洗的衣服。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At first, she walked home dazed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="回家路上，她开始头晕目眩。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The surreal experience with the roomful of books and the stunned, broken woman walked alongside her. She could see it on the buildings, like a play. Perhaps it was similar to the way Papa had his Mein Kampf revelation. Wherever she looked, Liesel saw the mayor's wife with the books piled up in her arms. Around corners, she could hear the shuffle of her own hands, disturbing the shelves. She saw the open window, the chandelier of lovely light, and she saw herself leaving, without so much as a word of thanks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="满屋子的书，惊愕，以及脆弱的女人，都犹如一种超现实的体验。她依然能在四周的建筑上空看到那一幕的幻影，宛如一出话剧。也许，爸爸想出《我的奋斗》的主意时，也有这样的体验。无论莉泽尔把目光投向哪里，总能看见镇长太太和她手里的那摞书。她走过每一个街角，都能听到手指划过书架的声响。她看见那扇窗户略微打开的缝隙，还有吊灯柔美的光线。她看见自己退出房间，却没有说一句谢谢。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She walked a good few minutes, struggling with indecision.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她走了好久好久，不住地同优柔寡断的内心搏斗。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You said nothing." Her head shook vigorously, among the hurried footsteps. "Not a 'goodbye.' Not a 'thank you.' Not a 'that's the most beautiful sight I've ever seen.' Nothing!" Certainly, she was a book thief, but that didn't mean she should have no manners at all. It didn't mean she couldn't be polite.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你什么都没说。”她快步前行，用力摇着脑袋，“没有一句再见。没有一句谢谢。没有一句这是我见过的最美的景象。什么都没说！”虽然她是个偷书贼，但这并不意味着她是个不懂礼数的人，也不意味着她不能彬彬有礼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Soon, her sedated condition transformed to harassment and self-loathing. She began to rebuke herself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="很快，她渐渐回复的冷静转变成困扰和自我厌恶。她开始指责自己。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was not the mayor's wife, but the mayor himself who stood before her. In her hurry, Liesel had neglected to notice the car that sat out front, on the street.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="来开门的不是镇长太太，而是镇长本人。莉泽尔急急忙忙的，没有注意到门前的街上停着一辆汽车。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Just as she could make out the sign that said STEINER -- SCHNEIDERMEISTER, she turned and ran back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看清那张写着“施泰纳裁缝店”的招牌时，她立即转身往回跑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This time, there was no hesitation.</div>

<div class="line_en">Liesel could say nothing. Not yet. She was bent over, short of air, and fortunately, the woman arrived when she'd at least partially recovered. Ilsa Hermann stood behind her husband, to the side.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莉泽尔什么也说不出口。现在还不行。她弯下腰，喘不过气来。幸好她多少恢复过来的时候，那女人也来到了门前。伊尔莎·赫尔曼站在丈夫身后一侧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She thumped the door, sending an echo of brass through the wood. Scheisse!</div>

<div class="line_en">"I forgot," Liesel said. She lifted the bag and addressed the mayor's wife. Despite the forced labor of breath, she fed the words through the gap in the doorway -- between the mayor and the frame -- to the woman. Such was her effort to breathe that the words escaped only a few at a time. "I forgot… I mean, I just… wanted," she said, "to… thank you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我忘了。”莉泽尔说。她举了举洗衣袋，转头面对镇长太太。尽管呼吸沉重，她还是透过镇长和门框间的缝隙，对女人说出了她想说的话。她依然喘不上气，所以每次只能断断续续地说出几个字。“我忘了…我的意思是…我只是想，”她说道，“说声谢谢。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The mayor's wife bruised herself again. Coming forward to stand beside her husband, she nodded very faintly, waited, and closed the door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="镇长太太又现出忧伤的笑容。她走到丈夫身边微弱地点了点头，过了一会儿就把门关上了。">查看中文翻译</div>
