<div class="line_en">She travelled partly by carriage and partly on foot, carrying her basket. Not far to her left she could see the trees which surrounded Kingsbere, with its church where her ancestors lay in their tombs. She could no longer admire or respect them. She almost hated them for ruining her life. Nothing of theirs was left except the old seal and spoon.</div>

<div class="line_en">As she stood and looked, she realized the valleys were quite different. Here the fields and farms were much larger. She saw more cows at a glance than she had ever seen before. The evening sun shone on their red, white and brown bodies. She thought that this view was perhaps not as beautiful as a view of Blackmoor Vale, which she knew so well. There the sky was deep blue, the smell of the earth was heavy in the air, the streams ran slowly and silently. But this view was more cheerful. Here the air was clear and light, and the river Froom rushed as fast as the shadow of a cloud.</div>

<div class="line_en">Her hopes rose higher than ever. She wanted to show how grateful she was for this second chance. She started singing love songs, but found they were not enough to express her feelings.

<div class="line_en">As Tess, full of enthusiasm, came downhill towards the dairy, she suddenly heard the milking call, again and again, from all parts of the valley. It was half-past four, when the dairy people brought in the cows. Tess followed the red and white animals, with their great bags of milk under them, into the farmyard. She saw the long sheds, and the wooden posts, shining and smooth where the cows had rubbed against them over the years. She saw the cows between the posts, the sun throwing their shadows on the wall as carefully as a painter paints a beautiful king or queen. As the cows waited for their turn, the milk fell in drops on the ground.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当苔丝热情洋溢地朝着牛奶场跑下山时，她突然听到了挤奶的号令，一遍又一遍地在山谷各个角落响起。现在是四点半，到了牛奶场的人们把牛赶回来的时候了。苔丝跟着这些红色或白色、身下垂着硕大乳房的动物，跑进了场院。她看见了一排长长的屋棚和一根根木桩，由于奶牛长年的摩擦，它们被蹭得油光发亮。她看见了木桩之间的一头头奶牛，阳光把它们的阴影投射到墙上，就像画家精心绘制的一幅美丽的国王或王后的画像。还没有轮到它们呢，有几滴牛奶已滴到了地上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The dairymaids and men had come from their cottages as they saw the cows arriving from the fields. Each girl sat on her three-legged stool as she milked, her right cheek resting on the cow's body, watching Tess arrive. The men milked with their hats low over their eyes and did not see her. One of them was a middle-aged man, the head-dairyman she was looking for. He worked six days a week in his white milking clothes, milking and butter-making, and on the seventh he wore his best suit to take his family proudly to church. Because of this people nearby used to say:</div>

No longer did he see them as lacking in intelligence. He realized they were no different from him: he and they were all people walking on the dusty road which ends in death.

<div class="line_en">Dairyman Crick insisted that all the dairy people should milk different cows every day, not just their favourites. He was worried that a dairymaid might leave the dairy, and then her cows would not like being milked by a stranger. However, Tess began to find that the cows which came to her usually happened to be her favourites. This made her milking much easier. But she soon realized that it was not by chance, as it was Angel Clare who sent the cows in for milking.</div>

<div class="line_en">That summer, Tess and Clare unconsciously studied each other, balanced on the edge of a passion, yet just keeping out of it. But all the time, like two streams in a valley, they were destined to join. Tess had never been so happy as she was now, and perhaps never would be so again. They met continually. They could not help it. They met daily in the half-light, at three o'clock in the morning, just before milking. They felt they were the first two up in the whole world, like Adam and Eve. Tess seemed like a queen to Clare, perhaps because he knew that she was the most beautiful woman walking about at this time of day. Lovely women are usually asleep at midsummer sunrise. But Tess was near, and the rest were nowhere. In the strange light she was no longer a milkmaid, but a vision of woman, the whole of womanhood in one form.</div>

<div class="line_en">The four walked on together. Marian broke the silence by saying, "No, we have no chance against her!" She looked joylessly at Tess.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="四个人继续往前走着。玛丽安打破了沉默，说道：“不，在她面前我们没有机会！”她闷闷不乐地看着苔丝。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They were no longer cheerful but they were not bitter. They were generous country girls who accept that such things happen. Tess's heart ached. She knew that she loved Angel Clare, perhaps all the more passionately because the others also loved him. And yet that same hungry heart of hers pitied her friends.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她们的愉快心情一扫而光，但她们也并不怀恨在心。她们都是宽厚的乡下姑娘，能够接受这种事情的发生。苔丝的心在作痛。她知道她爱安吉尔·克莱尔，也许这种爱变得更强烈了，因为其他姑娘也在爱着他。然而，正是她那颗充满渴望的心，对她的朋友们产生了同情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He likes you best, the very best! We saw as he brought you over. He'd have kissed you if you had encouraged him, only a little."</div>

<div class="line_en">"I will never stand in your way!" she cried to them that evening in the bedroom. "I don't think he's thinking of marrying, but even if he asked me, I'd refuse him, as I'd refuse any man."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我将永远不会妨碍你们的！”那天晚上在卧室里，她向她们宣布，“我认为他并没有在考虑结婚，但是即使他向我求婚，我也会拒绝他的，就像拒绝任何其他男人一样。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh why?" they asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，为什么？”她们问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So the girls remained friends. They all shared each other's secret. The air in their bedroom was full of their hopeless passion. There was a flame burning the inside of their hearts out. But because they had no hope, they were not jealous of each other. They had even heard that Angel's family were planning for him to marry a neighbour's daughter. Tess no longer attached any importance to Clare's interest in her. It was a passing summer attraction, nothing more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这样，姑娘们还是朋友。她们互相分享彼此的秘密。她们卧室的空气中充斥着没有希望的热情。她们的心被激情燃烧着。但是因为她们不抱任何希望，她们之间也就没有妒忌。他们甚至还听说，安吉尔的家人正打算让他娶一个邻居的女儿。克莱尔对她的关注对苔丝来说，已不再有任何重要性。这只是一次夏天的、转瞬即逝的吸引，仅此而已。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Suddenly Clare jumped up, leaving his bucket to be kicked over by the cow, went quickly towards her, and, kneeling down beside her, took her in his arms. Tess let herself relax in his arms in a moment of joyful surprise. He was on the point of kissing that tempting mouth, but stopped himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然，克莱尔从坐的地方一跃而起，顾不上奶牛是否会把奶桶踢翻，快速地向她跑去。他跪在她身旁，把她搂进了怀里。那一刻，苔丝又惊又喜，她让自己依顺地偎在了他的怀里。他差点就要亲吻那张充满诱惑的小嘴了，但他抑制住了自己。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The heat grew steadily greater. In this stormy atmosphere even a passing attraction would deepen into love. Everything in nature was ready for love. Clare became gradually more passionately in love with the soft and silent Tess. The fields were dry. Waggons threw up clouds of dust on the road. Cows jumped over gates, chased by flies. Dairyman Crick's sleeves were rolled up from Monday to Saturday, and the milkers milked in the fields for coolness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="气温不断地升高。在这多风暴的空气中，甚至短暂的吸引都会成为深深的爱慕。自然中的一切事物都为爱作好了准备。克莱尔对温柔沉静的苔丝的爱也越来越炽烈了。地是干的，马车驶过，扬起一片尘烟。奶牛跳过栅门，被一群苍蝇追逐着。奶场主克里克卷起袖子从星期一干到星期六，为了图凉快，工人们都在地里挤奶。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On one of these afternoons Tess and Angel were milking near each other. Tess used to rest her head on the cow's body, her eyes fixed on a distant field. The sun shone on the beautiful lines of the face. She did not know that Clare had followed her round and sat watching her. How very lovable her face was to him. He had never seen such beautiful lips and teeth, like roses filled with snow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在这样的一个下午，苔丝和安吉尔在相距不远的地方挤着奶。苔丝习惯于把头靠在奶牛的身上休息，眼睛注视着远方的田野。阳光照在她脸庞秀美的轮廓上。她不知道克莱尔已经跟着她过来了，正坐着观看她。那是张多么讨人喜欢的脸啊！他从来没有见过如此美丽动人的唇齿，恰如含雪的玫瑰一般。">查看中文翻译</div>
