<div class="line_en">Dad didn't have enough of a crew to build hay sheds, so he went back to scrapping. With Tyler gone, the rest of us were promoted: Luke, at sixteen, became the eldest son, my father's right hand, and Richard and I took his place as grunts.</div>

<div class="line_en">The winter after Tyler left, Audrey turned fifteen. She picked up her driver's license from the county courthouse and, on her way home, got a job flipping burgers. Then she took a second job milking cows at four A. M. every morning. For a year she'd been fighting with Dad, bucking under the restraints he put on her. Now she had money; she had her own car; we hardly saw her. The family was shrinking, the old hierarchy compressing.</div>

<div class="line_en">I remember the first morning I entered the junkyard as one of my father's crew. The earth was ice, even the air felt stiff. We were in the yard above the lower pasture, which was overrun by hundreds of cars and trucks. Some were old and broken down but most had been wrecked and they looked it -- bent, arched, twisted, the impression they gave was of crumpled paper, not steel. In the center of the yard there was a lake of debris, vast and deep: leaking car batteries, tangles of insulated copper wire, abandoned transmissions, rusted sheets of corrugated tin, antique faucets, smashed radiators, serrated lengths of luminous brass pipe, and on and on. It was endless, a formless mass.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我记得作为父亲小工队成员的第一天早上进入废料场的情景。地面结了冰，寒气刺骨。我们来到山下草场上方的院子，院里堆满了数百辆小车和卡车。有些车又旧又破，大多数都是被撞坏的，弯弯扭扭，感觉不像是钢做的，倒像是皱巴巴的纸糊的。院子正中央是大片成堆的残骸：泄漏的汽车电池、缠绕的绝缘铜线、废弃的变速器、生锈的瓦楞铁皮、老式水龙头、破碎的散热器、锯齿状的发光黄铜管等等。没有尽头，没有形状，乱作一大团。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The first time I saw him do it, I thought it was an accident, a mishap that would be corrected. I hadn't yet grasped the rules of this new world.

<div class="line_en">Dad lived in fear of time. He felt it stalking him. I could see it in the worried glances he gave the sun as it moved across the sky, in the anxious way he appraised every length of pipe or cut of steel. Dad saw every piece of scrap as the money it could be sold for, minus the time needed to sort, cut and deliver it. Every slab of iron, every ring of copper tubing was a nickel, a dime, a dollar -- less if it took more than two seconds to extract and classify -- and he constantly weighed these meager profits against the hourly expense of running the house. He figured that to keep the lights on, the house warm, he needed to work at breakneck speed. I never saw Dad carry anything to a sorting bin; he just chucked it, with all the strength he had, from wherever he was standing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爸爸活在对时间的恐惧中。他感觉时间在他身后紧追不舍。从他不时忧心忡忡地瞥一眼划过天空的太阳，从他焦急地掂量每支管子或每根钢条，我能看出这一点。在爸爸眼里，每一块废品就是它被卖掉换来的钱，扣除整理、切割和送货的时间成本。每一块废铁、每一圈铜管都是一分、一毛或一块钱——如果提取分类的时间超过两秒，利润还要打折扣——他不断地拿这些微薄的利润权衡家里的日常开支。他计算出为了让家里亮亮堂堂、暖暖和和，他必须极其迅速地干活。我从没见过爸爸搬着什么东西放进分类箱；不管站在哪儿，他只是用尽全力，随手抛掷。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I remembered all the times I'd seen one of my brothers burst through the back door, howling, pinching some part of his body that was gashed or squashed or broken or burned. I remembered two years before, when a man named Robert, who worked for Dad, had lost a finger. I remembered the otherworldly pitch of his scream as he ran to the house. I remembered staring at the bloody stump, and then at the severed finger, which Luke brought in and placed on the counter. It looked like a prop from a magic trick. Mother put it on ice and rushed Robert to town so the doctors could sew it back on. Robert's was not the only finger the junkyard had claimed. A year before Robert, Shawn's girlfriend, Emma, had come through the back door shrieking. She'd been helping Shawn and lost half her index. Mother had rushed Emma to town, too, but the flesh had been crushed, and there was nothing they could do.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我见过某个哥哥捂着身体上割破、压烂、断裂或烧伤的部位，大声号叫着从后门冲进来，种种情景历历在目。我想起两年前，爸爸手下有个叫罗伯特的人在干活时丢了一根手指。我记得他朝家跑去时那非人的惨叫声。我忆起自己盯着他血淋淋的残肢，盯着卢克拿来放在台面上的断指。它看上去就像一个魔术道具。母亲把它放在冰块上，紧急送罗伯特到镇上，以便医生将断指缝合回去。罗伯特并非唯一一个在废料场断送手指的人。在他出事前一年，肖恩的女友艾玛也曾尖叫着从后门冲进来。她在帮肖恩干活时断了半根食指。母亲也把艾玛送到镇上，但当时肉全被压碎，医生也无能为力。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The impact knocked me to the ground. "Oops!" Dad hollered. I rolled over on the ice, winded. By the time I'd scrambled to my feet, Dad had launched something else. I ducked but lost my footing and fell. This time I stayed down. I was shaking but not from cold. My skin was alive and tingling with the certainty of danger, yet when I looked for the source of that danger, all I could see was a tired old man, tugging on a broken light fixture.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我被击倒在地。“哎呀！”爸爸大喊一声。我气喘吁吁地在冰上打滚。等我爬起来，爸爸又扔过来别的东西。我一个躲闪，但没留意脚底，又摔倒在地。这一次我没有立即起来。我浑身发抖，但不是因为冷。我的皮肤因四周确定无疑的危险而兴奋、刺痛，但当我寻找危险的来源时，我只看到一位疲倦的老人，正拽着一个坏了的灯具。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I looked at my own pink fingers, and in that moment the junkyard shifted. As children, Richard and I had passed countless hours in the debris, jumping from one mangled car to the next, looting some, leaving others. It had been the backdrop for a thousand imagined battles -- between demons and wizards, fairies and goons, trolls and giants. Now it was changed. It had ceased to be my childhood playground and had become its own reality, one whose physical laws were mysterious, hostile.</div>

<div class="line_en">I wasn't the only one whose feet were searching for solid ground. For six months after the car accident, Mother had improved steadily and we'd thought she would fully recover. The headaches had become less frequent, so that she was shutting herself in the basement only two or three days a week. Then the healing had slowed. Now it had been nine months. The headaches persisted, and Mother's memory was erratic. At least twice a week she'd ask me to cook breakfast long after everyone had eaten and the dishes had been cleared. She'd tell me to weigh a pound of yarrow for a client, and I'd remind her that we'd delivered the yarrow the day before. She'd begin mixing a tincture, then a minute later couldn't remember which ingredients she'd added, so that the whole batch had to be tossed. Sometimes she would ask me to stand next to her and watch, so I could say, "You already added the lobelia. Next is the blue vervain."</div>

<div class="line_en">In the end it wasn't Dad who convinced Mother to midwife again. She convinced herself, perhaps because it was a part of herself she couldn't surrender without some kind of struggle. That winter, she midwifed two babies that I remember. After the first she came home sickly and pale, as if bringing that life into the world had taken a measure of her own. She was shut in the basement when the second call came. She drove to the birth in dark glasses, trying to peer through the waves distorting her vision. By the time she arrived the headache was blinding, pulsing, driving out all thought. She locked herself in a back room and her assistant delivered the baby. After that, Mother was no longer the Midwife. On the next birth, she used the bulk of her fee to hire a second midwife, to supervise her. Everyone was supervising her now, it seemed. She had been an expert, an uncontested power; now she had to ask her ten-year-old daughter whether she'd eaten lunch. That winter was long and dark, and I wondered if sometimes Mother was staying in bed even when she didn't have a migraine.</div>

<div class="line_en">At Christmas, someone gave her an expensive bottle of blended essential oils. It helped her headaches, but at fifty dollars for a third of an ounce, we couldn't afford it. Mother decided to make her own. She began buying single, unmixed oils -- eucalyptus and helichrysum, sandalwood and ravensara -- and the house, which for years had smelled of earthy bark and bitter leaves, suddenly smelled of lavender and chamomile. She spent whole days blending oils, making adjustments to achieve specific fragrances and attributes. She worked with a pad and pen so she could record every step as she took it. The oils were much more expensive than the tinctures; it was devastating when she had to throw out a batch because she couldn't remember whether she'd added the spruce. She made an oil for migraines and an oil for menstrual cramps, one for sore muscles and one for heart palpitations. In the coming years she would invent dozens more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="圣诞节时，有人送给她一瓶价格昂贵的混合精油。它有助于缓解她的头痛，但以三分之一盎司五十美元的价格，我们买不起。母亲决定自己制作。她开始买来单一纯精油——桉树、蜡菊、檀香、罗文沙——多年来家里一直弥漫着树皮的土味和树叶的苦味，突然换成了薰衣草和甘菊的芬芳。她整天都在混合、调制精油，以获得特定的香味和属性。她随身带着记事簿和笔，以便把每一步骤都记录下来。精油可比酊剂贵多了；因为忘记是否添加了云杉而不得不扔掉一批精油时，她心痛极了。她制作了缓解偏头痛和痛经的精油，以及用于肌肉酸痛和心悸的精油。接下来几年，她又发明了几十种精油。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">To create her formulas, Mother took up something called "muscle testing," which she explained to me as "asking the body what it needs and letting it answer." Mother would say to herself, aloud, "I have a migraine. What will make it better?" Then she would pick up a bottle of oil, press it to her chest and, with her eyes closed, say, "Do I need this?" If her body swayed forward it meant yes, the oil would help her headache. If her body swayed backward it meant no, and she would test something else.</div>

<div class="line_en">As she became more skilled, Mother went from using her whole body to only her fingers. She would cross her middle and index fingers, then flex slightly to try to uncross them, asking herself a question. If the fingers remained entwined that meant yes; if they parted it was no. The sound produced by this method was faint but unmistakable: each time the pad of her middle finger slipped across the nail of her index, there was a fleshy click.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="越来越熟练后，母亲就不再动用整个身体，而改用手指。她会交叉中指和食指，然后问自己一个问题，同时稍微弯曲手指，试图分开它们。如果两个手指仍然交缠在一起，就意味着“是”；如果分开，就代表“不是”。这个方法产生的声响虽轻微，却明确无误：每次她中指指肚滑过食指指甲，就会发出一声丰满的啪嗒。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mother used muscle testing to experiment with other methods of healing. Diagrams of chakras and pressure points appeared around the house, and she began charging clients for something called "energy work." I didn't know what that meant until one afternoon when Mother called me and Richard into the back room. A woman named Susan was there. Mother's eyes were closed and her left hand was resting on Susan's. The fingers on her other hand were crossed, and she was whispering questions to herself. After a few she turned to the woman and said, "Your relationship with your father is damaging your kidneys. Think of him while we adjust the chakra." Mother explained that energy work is most effective when several people are present. "So we can draw from everyone's energy," she said. Mother pointed to my forehead and told me to tap the center, between my eyebrows, while with my other hand I was to grab Susan's arm. Richard was to tap a pressure point on his chest while reaching out to me with his other hand, and Mother was to hold a point in her palm while touching Richard with her foot. "That's it," she said as Richard took my arm. We stood in silence for ten minutes, a human chain.</div>

<div class="line_en">If I was skeptical, my skepticism was not entirely my fault. It was the result of my not being able to decide which of my mothers to trust. A year before the accident, when Mother had first heard of muscle testing and energy work, she'd dismissed both as wishful thinking. "People want a miracle," she'd told me. "They'll swallow anything if it brings them hope, if it lets them believe they're getting better. But there's no such thing as magic. Nutrition, exercise and a careful study of herbal properties, that's all there is. But when they're suffering, people can't accept that."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果我有所怀疑，那并不完全是我的错，而是因为我无法确定应该相信哪一个母亲。车祸发生的前一年，母亲第一次听说肌肉测试和能量工作，觉得那全是人的一厢情愿。“人总是希望奇迹发生。”她对我说，“如果能给他们带来希望，让他们相信自己正在好转，他们就什么都信，什么都吃。但是世界上根本没有魔法这种东西。营养、锻炼和钻研草药特性，这才是全部。但人们生病受罪时，你说这个他们不接受。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When I think of that afternoon, what I remember first is the awkwardness of it: Mother said she could feel the hot energy moving through our bodies, but I felt nothing. Mother and Richard stood still, eyes shut, breath shallow. They could feel the energy and were transported by it. I fidgeted.

Richard was also supposed to spend his afternoons making tinctures for Mother, but he almost never did. Instead, he'd disappear. I don't know if Mother knew where he went, but I did. In the afternoons, Richard could nearly always be found in the dark basement, wedged in the crawl space between the couch and the wall, an encyclopedia propped open in front of him. If Dad happened by he'd turn the light off, muttering about wasted electricity. Then I'd find some excuse to go downstairs so I could turn it back on. If Dad came through again, a snarl would sound through the house, and Mother would have to sit through a lecture on leaving lights on in empty rooms. She never scolded me, which makes me wonder if she did know where Richard was.

I read the New Testament, once quickly, then a second time more slowly, pausing to make notes, to cross-reference, and even to write short essays on doctrines like faith and sacrifice. No one read the essays; I wrote them for myself, the way I imagined Tyler had studied for himself and himself only. I worked through the Old Testament next, then I read Dad's books, which were mostly compilations of the speeches, letters and journals of the early Mormon prophets. Their language was of the nineteenth century -- stiff, winding, but exact -- and at first I understood nothing. But over time my eyes and ears adjusted, so that I began to feel at home with those fragments of my people's history: stories of pioneers, my ancestors, striking out across the American wilderness. While the stories were vivid, the lectures were abstract, treatises on obscure philosophical subjects, and it was to these abstractions that I devoted most of my study.</div>

<div class="line_en">I worked faster when I salvaged alone, so one morning when Dad was in the northern tip of the yard, near the mountain, I headed for the southern tip, near the pasture. I filled a bin with two thousand pounds of iron; then, my arms aching, I ran to find Dad. The bin had to be emptied, and I couldn't operate the loader -- a massive forklift with a telescopic arm and wide, black wheels that were taller than I was. The loader would raise the bin some twenty-five feet into the air and then, with the boom extended, tilt the forks so the scrap could slide out, raining down into the trailer with a tremendous clamor. The trailer was a fifty-foot flatbed rigged for scrapping, essentially a giant bucket. Its walls were made of thick iron sheets that reached eight feet from the bed. The trailer could hold between fifteen and twenty bins, or about forty thousand pounds of iron.</div>

<div class="line_en">I settled myself on a length of iron. Dad jammed the forks under the bin, then lifted me and the scrap and began driving, full throttle, toward the trailer's head. I could barely hold on. On the last turn, the bucket swung with such force that a spike of iron was flung toward me. It pierced the inside of my leg, an inch below my knee, sliding into the tissue like a knife into warm butter. I tried to pull it out but the load had shifted, and it was partially buried. I heard the soft groaning of hydraulic pumps as the boom extended. The groaning stopped when the bin was level with the trailer. Dad was giving me time to climb onto the trailer wall but I was pinned. "I'm stuck!" I shouted, only the growl of the loader's engine was too loud.

<div class="line_en">The hydraulics groaned and the bin raised another eight feet. Dumping position. I shouted again, higher this time, then lower, trying to find a pitch that would pierce through the drone of the engine. The bin began its tilt, slowly at first, then quickly. I was pinned near the back. I wrapped my hands around the bin's top wall, knowing this would give me a ledge to grasp when the bin was vertical. As the bin continued to pitch, the scrap at the front began to slide forward, bit by bit, a great iron glacier breaking apart. The spike was still embedded in my leg, dragging me downward. My grip had slipped and I'd begun to slide when the spike finally ripped from me and fell away, smashing into the trailer with a tremendous crash. I was now free, but falling. I flailed my arms, willing them to seize something that wasn't plunging downward. My palm caught hold of the bin's side wall, which was now nearly vertical. I pulled myself toward it and hoisted my body over its edge, then continued my fall. Because I was now falling from the side of the bin and not the front, I hoped -- I prayed -- that I was falling toward the ground and not toward the trailer, which was at that moment a fury of grinding metal. I sank, seeing only blue sky, waiting to feel either the stab of sharp iron or the jolt of solid earth.</div>

She rested her left hand lightly on the gash and crossed the fingers of her right. Her eyes closed. Click click click. "There's no tetanus," she said. "The wound will close. Eventually. But it'll leave a nasty scar."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我头晕目眩地穿过最后一片田野，朝房子走去。和之前见到的哥哥们、罗伯特和艾玛一样，我也从后门冲进去，呼喊着母亲。当她看到油毡上深红色的血脚印，便拿出治疗出血和休克、被叫作“急救疗法”的顺势疗法。她在我的舌下滴了十二滴清澈无味的液体，左手轻轻搁在伤口上，右手手指交叉。她闭上眼睛。啪嗒，啪嗒，啪嗒。“没有破伤风，”她说，“伤口最终会长好，但会留下一个讨厌的伤疤。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She turned me onto my stomach and examined the bruise -- a patch of deep purple the size of a human head -- that had formed a few inches above my hip. Again her fingers crossed and her eyes closed. Click click click.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她让我趴下，检查了我屁股上方几英寸处的瘀伤——一片深紫色，和人脑袋一般大小。她再次交叉手指，闭上眼睛。啪嗒，啪嗒，啪嗒。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The gash below my knee had formed a scab -- dark and shiny, a black river flowing through pink flesh -- when I came to a decision.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我膝盖下面的伤口已经结痂——黑亮亮的，像一条黑色小河流经粉红的肌肉。这时，我做了一个决定。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I chose a Sunday evening, when Dad was resting on the couch, his Bible propped open in his lap. I stood in front of him for what felt like hours, but he didn't look up, so I blurted out what I'd come to say: "I want to go to school."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我挑了一个星期日的晚上，当时爸爸正在沙发上休息，腿上放着打开的《圣经》。我在他面前感觉站了有好几个小时，但他始终没有抬头，于是我脱口而出：“我想去上学。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I've prayed, and I want to go," I said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我祈祷过，我想去。”我说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He picked up his Bible and his eyes twitched as they jumped from line to line. I turned to leave, but before I reached the doorway Dad spoke again. "You remember Jacob and Esau?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他拿起《圣经》，转动眼珠从一行跳到另一行。我转身要走，但还没走到门口，爸爸开口了：“你还记得雅各和以扫的故事吗？”[7]【注：[7]《圣经》中雅各和以扫是孪生子，以扫为长子，雅各为幼子。以扫因为“一碗红豆汤”随意地将长子名分“卖”给了雅各。（《创世记》25：29—34）】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I remember," I said.</div>

<div class="line_en">He returned to his reading, and I left quietly. I did not need any explanation; I knew what the story meant. It meant that I was not the daughter he had raised, the daughter of faith. I had tried to sell my birthright for a mess of pottage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他继续读经文，我静静地离开了。无须任何解释。我知道这个故事的意思。他的意思是说，我不是他养育出的女儿，他的女儿秉持虔诚的信仰。我竟然为了一碗破汤而试图出卖自己与生俱来的权利。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Finally, Dad looked up and straight ahead, his gaze fixed on something behind me. The silence settled, its presence heavy. "In this family," he said, "we obey the commandments of the Lord."</div>
