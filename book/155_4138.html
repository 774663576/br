<div class="line_en">The remainder of my schooldays were no more auspicious than the first. Indeed, they were an endless Project that slowly evolved into a Unit, in which miles of construction paper and wax crayon were expended by the State of Alabama in its well-meaning but fruitless efforts to teach me Group Dynamics. What Jem called the Dewey Decimal System was school-wide by the end of my first year, so I had no chance to compare it with other teaching techniques. I could only look around me: Atticus and my uncle, who went to school at home, knew everything -- at least, what one didn't know the other did. Furthermore, I couldn't help noticing that my father had served for years in the state legislature, elected each time without opposition, innocent of the adjustments my teachers thought essential to the development of Good Citizenship. Jem, educated on a half-Decimal half-Duncecap basis, seemed to function effectively alone or in a group, but Jem was a poor example: no tutorial system devised by man could have stopped him from getting at books. As for me, I knew nothing except what I gathered from Time magazine and reading everything I could lay hands on at home, but as I inched sluggishly along the treadmill of the Maycomb County school system, I could not help receiving the impression that I was being cheated out of something. Out of what I knew not, yet I did not believe that twelve years of unrelieved boredom was exactly what the state had in mind for me.</div>

<div class="line_en">Two live oaks stood at the edge of the Radley lot; their roots reached out into the side-road and made it bumpy. Something about one of the trees attracted my attention.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拉德利家的地界边缘上有两棵常青橡树，树根延伸列人行道上，使路而拱起来。其中一棵树上有个什么东西吸引了我的注意力。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As the year passed, released from school thirty minutes before Jem, who had to stay until three o'clock, I ran by the Radley Place as fast as I could, not stopping until I reached the safety of our front porch. One afternoon as I raced by, something caught my eye and caught it in such a way that I took a deep breath, a long look around, and went back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="时间在慢慢流逝。每天我比杰姆早三十分钟放学，他不到三点不能离校。我尽快地跑过拉德利家，一口气跑到我家前廊的安全地带才停下来。一天下午，我跑过时突然看见什么东西，这东西强烈地吸引了我：我深深地吸了一口气，朝周围仔细张望了一番，又返回去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Some tinfoil was sticking in a knot-hole just above my eye level, winking at me in the afternoon sun. I stood on tiptoe, hastily looked around once more, reached into the hole, and withdrew two pieces of chewing gum minus their outer wrappers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在比我的眼睛略高的树节孔里粘着一些锡箔纸，在阳光下闪闪发光。我踮起脚，匆匆朝周围扫视了一遍，把手伸进小洞，意外地掏出了两块不带包装纸的口香糖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My first impulse was to get it into my mouth as quickly as possible, but I remembered where I was. I ran home, and on our front porch I examined my loot. The gum looked fresh. I sniffed it and it smelled all right. I licked it and waited for a while. When I did not die I crammed it into my mouth: Wrigley's Double-Mint.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我的第一个念头是立刻把它放进嘴里，可是又想起了这是什么地方。我跑回家，在前廊上仔细查看了我的这件战利品。这糖看上去挺新鲜。我闻了闻，气味也正常；用舌头舔一下，等了一会儿，我并没有死，于是把它塞进嘴里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Rather than risk a tangle with Calpurnia, I did as Jem told me. For some reason, my first year of school had wrought a great change in our relationship: Calpurnia's tyranny, unfairness, and meddling in my business had faded to gentle grumblings of general disapproval. On my part, I went to much trouble, sometimes, not to provoke her.</div>

<div class="line_en">Summer was on the way; Jem and I awaited it with impatience. Summer was our best season: it was sleeping on the back screened porch in cots, or trying to sleep in the treehouse; summer was everything good to eat; it was a thousand colors in a parched landscape; but most of all, summer was Dill.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="夏天就要来了；我和杰姆急不可待。夏天是我们最好的季节：夏天意味着睡在装着纱窗的后廊上的帆布床上，或者睡在树上的小屋里；夏天有很多好吃的；夏天，在阳光照耀下风景秀丽，色彩斑斓。但最主要的是，夏天意味着我们会跟遗尔一起玩。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jem looked around, reached up, and gingerly pocketed a tiny shiny package. We ran home, and on the front porch we looked at a small box patchworked with bits of tinfoil collected from chewing-gum wrappers. It was the kind of box wedding rings came in, purple velvet with a minute catch. Jem flicked open the tiny catch. Inside were two scrubbed and polished pennies, one on top of the other. Jem examined them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰姆朝周围看了看，伸手小心翼翼地把一个发光的小纸包放进口袋。我们跑回家，在前廊上，我们仔细检查了得到的这个小盒子。这是用包口香糖的锡蒲纸一点点拼凑起来的，样子象装结婚戒指的小盒，用紫红色的丝绒装饰着，带有一个精巧的小搭扣。杰姆轻轻打开搭扣，里面是两枚擦得光亮的面值一便士的硬币，一上一下叠放着。杰姆反复看了看。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As we came to the live oaks at the Radley Place I raised my finger to point for the hundredth time to the knot-hole where I had found the chewing gum, trying to make Jem believe I had found it there, and found myself pointing at another piece of tinfoil.</div>

He had discarded the abominable blue shorts that were buttoned to his shirts and wore real short pants with a belt; he was somewhat heavier, no taller, and said he had seen his father.

<div class="line_en">Until it happened I did not realize that Jem was offended by my contradicting him on Hot Steams, and that he was patiently awaiting an opportunity to reward me. He did, by pushing the tire down the sidewalk with all the force in his body. Ground, sky and houses melted into a mad palette, my ears throbbed, I was suffocating. I could not put out my hands to stop, they were wedged between my chest and knees. I could only hope that Jem would outrun the tire and me, or that I would be stopped by a bump in the sidewalk.
