<div class="line_en">Whitetree, Sam thought. Please, let this be Whitetree. He remembered Whitetree. Whitetree was on the maps he'd drawn, on their way north. If this village was Whitetree, he knew where they were. Please, it has to be. He wanted that so badly that he forgot his feet for a little bit, he forgot the ache in his calves and his lower back and the stiff frozen fingers he could scarcely feel. He even forgot about Lord Mormont and Craster and the wights and the Others. Whitetree, Sam prayed, to any god that might be listening.</div>

<div class="line_en">All wildling villages looked much alike, though. A huge weirwood grew in the center of this one… but a white tree did not mean Whitetree, necessarily. Hadn't the weirwood at Whitetree been bigger than this one? Maybe he was remembering it wrong. The face carved into the bone pale trunk was long and sad; red tears of dried sap leaked from its eyes. Was that how it looked when we came north? Sam couldn't recall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而所有野人村庄看起来都很像。一棵巨大的鱼梁木生在这个村子中央…但一棵白树并不代表白树村，白树村的鱼梁木是否比这棵更大呢？也许他记错了。那张长而悲哀的脸刻在苍白如骨的树干上，树液从它眼睛里渗出、凝固，仿如红色的泪水。我们北上时，它看起来是这样吗？山姆记不清楚。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Around the tree stood a handful of one-room hovels with sod roofs, a longhall built of logs and grown over with moss, a stone well, a sheepfold… but no sheep, nor any people. The wildlings had gone to join Mance Rayder in the Frostfangs, taking all they owned except their houses. Sam was thankful for that. Night was coming on, and it would be good to sleep beneath a roof for once. He was so tired. It seemed as though he had been walking half his life. His boots were falling to pieces, and all the blisters on his feet had burst and turned to callus, but now he had new blisters under the callus, and his toes were getting frostbitten.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="树的周围矗立着几幢茅草顶的单房屋子，一栋覆满苔藓的木头长厅，一口石井，一个羊圈…但没有羊，更没有人。野人们都去了霜雪之牙，加入曼斯·雷德的队伍，并带走了一切东西，除开房屋本身——山姆对此感激不尽。夜晚即将来临，而他终于可以重新睡在屋檐底下。他好疲惫，好像走了半辈子的路，靴子片片脱落，脚上所有的水泡都已破裂，变成老茧，老茧下又起了新的水泡，而脚趾头开始生冻疮。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sam left Gilly in the longhall to make a fire while he poked his head into the hovels. She was better at making fires; he could never seem to get the kindling to catch, and the last time he'd tried to strike a spark off flint and steel he managed to cut himself on his knife. Gilly bound up the gash for him, but his hand was stiff and sore, even clumsier than it had been before. He knew he should wash the wound and change the binding, but he was afraid to look at it. Besides, it was so cold that he hated taking off his gloves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆让吉莉留在长厅里生火，自己则到附近小屋里探察一番。她连生火都比他在行，他自己好像从来无法点燃木柴，上次，他试图用铁和石头打出火星，结果却被自己的匕首割伤。吉莉替他包扎好之后，手指变得僵硬疼痛，比原先更为笨拙。他知道现在是清洗伤口、更换绷带的时候了，但他害怕看到伤口。况且天气如此寒冷，他痛恨摘手套。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But it was either walk or die, Sam knew. Gilly was still weak from childbirth and carrying the babe besides; she needed the horse more than he did. The second horse had died on them three days out from Craster's Keep. It was a wonder she lasted that long, poor half-starved thing. Sam's weight had probably done for her. They might have tried riding double, but he was afraid the same thing would happen again. It's better that I walk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但山姆知道，如果不走，就只有死路一条。吉莉产后仍然虚弱，还抱着孩子，她比他更需要那匹马。另外一匹在离开卡斯特堡垒后的第三天就没了。可怜的家伙，本来已饿得半死，能支撑这么久其实是个奇迹，也许正是山姆的体重压垮了它罢。他们可以尝试共骑一匹马，但他担心同样的事情再次发生。我这胖子最好还是走路。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sam did not know what he hoped to find in the empty houses. Maybe the wildlings had left some food behind. He had to take a look. Jon had searched the huts at Whitetree, on their way north. Inside one hovel Sam heard a rustling of rats from a dark corner, but otherwise there was nothing in any of them but old straw, old smells, and some ashes beneath the smoke hole.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆不知自己能在屋里找到什么。也许野人们留下了一点食物，好歹得瞧一瞧。北上途中，琼恩就被分到任务，搜查白树村的屋子。在一栋小屋中，山姆听见黑暗角落里传来老鼠窸窸窣窣的声音，除此之外别无他物，只有干稻草堆、陈腐的气味和排烟口下的炭灰。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">By the time he returned to the longhall, Gilly had the fire going. She sat close to it with her furs opened, the babe at her breast. He's as hungry as we are, Sam thought. The old women had smuggled out food for them from Craster's, but they had eaten most of it by now. Sam had been a hopeless hunter even at Hom Hill, where game was plentiful and he had hounds and huntsmen to help him; here in this endless empty forest, the chances of him catching anything were remote. His efforts at fishing the lakes and half-frozen streams had been dismal failures as well.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等回到长厅，吉莉已生好了火。她紧靠在火堆旁，敞开兽皮，让婴儿在胸口吃奶。他跟大人一样饿，山姆心想。老妇人们从卡斯特堡垒的地窖里捎出些食物，但现在基本吃光了，而即使在角陵，即使在猎物众多，手下又有奴仆、猎狗可供驱使的南方家园，山姆也是个没用的猎手；身处这片空旷无垠的森林，能逮住任何东西的机会自然微乎其微。他试图在湖泊和半冻的小河里捕鱼，结果不出意料地惨遭失败。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He turned back to the weirwood and studied the carved face a moment. It is not the face we saw, he admitted to himself. The tree's not half as big as the one at Whitetree. The red eyes wept blood, and he didn't remember that either. Clumsily, Sam sank to his knees. "Old gods, hear my prayer. The Seven were my father's gods but I said my words to you when I joined the Watch. Help us now. I fear we might be lost. We're hungry too, and so cold. I don't know what gods I believe in now, but… please, if you're there, help us. Gilly has a little son." That was all that he could think to say. The dusk was deepening, the leaves of the weirwood rustling softly, waving like a thousand blood-red hands. Whether Jon's gods had heard him or not he could not say.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他回到鱼梁木旁，端详了一会儿那张雕刻的脸。这不是曾经见过的那张脸，他承认，这棵树不及白树村那棵一半大。它的红眼睛里渗出血色的汁液，他也不记得从前那棵是这样。但不管怎么说，山姆笨手笨脚地跪下来。“远古诸神，请听我的祈祷。七神是我父亲的神祗，但我加入守夜人军团时，是面对着你们发下誓言的。请帮帮忙吧，我们又冷又饿，很可能还会迷路。我…我不知现在该信仰什么神，但…假如你们真的存在，请帮帮我们吧，吉莉刚生下一个小婴儿。”他只能想出这些话。夜色渐浓，鱼梁木的树叶发出轻微的瑟瑟声，好似上千只血手在挥舞。琼恩的神是否听见了他的祈祷呢？一切都不清楚。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“还要多久，山姆？”吉莉问，“还远吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Not so far. Not so far as it was." Sam shrugged out of his pack, eased himself awkwardly to the floor, and tried to cross his legs. His back ached so abominably from the walking that he would have liked to lean up against one of the carved wooden pillars that supported the roof, but the fire was in the center of the hall beneath the smoke hole and he craved warmth even more than comfort. "Another few days should see us there."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不太远。至少不像原来那么远。”山姆耸肩卸下包裹，笨拙地坐到地板上，试着盘起腿来。走路使他的背疼到极点，他想倚住一根支撑屋顶的木雕支柱，但火堆却在长厅中央的排烟口下，衡量之后，还是觉得温暖甚于舒适，“再过几天就能到了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sam had his maps, but if this wasn't Whitetree then they weren't going to be much use. We went too far east to get around that lake, he fretted, or maybe too far west when I tried to double back. He was coming to hate lakes and rivers. Up here there was never a ferry or bridge, which meant walking all the way around the lakes and searching for places to ford the rivers. It was easier to follow a game trail than to struggle through the brush, easier to circle a ridge instead of climbing it. If Bannen or Dywen were with us we'd be at Castle Black by now, warming our feet in the common room. Barmen was dead, though, and Dywen gone with Grenn and Dolorous Edd and the others.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆带着地图，但如果这里不是白树村，它们根本没用。我们为绕过这个湖，走得太靠东，他焦虑地想，或者折回来时太靠西了？他开始讨厌起湖泊与河流，长城之外没有渡船和桥梁，逼得你绕行一大圈，或是寻找涉水的浅滩。除此之外，跟随猎人小径比挣扎穿越灌木丛容易，绕过山脊比攀爬容易，而长城之外只能选择后者。唉，假如巴棱或戴文跟我们在一起，现下应该已到了黑城堡，正在大厅里暖脚呢。可惜巴棱死了，而戴文跟葛兰、忧郁的艾迪等人一起离开。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">What he wasn't so certain of was how far east or west they might have strayed. They would reach the Wall, yes… in a day or a fortnight, it couldn't be farther than that, surely, surely… but where? It was the gate at Castle Black they needed to find; the only way through the Wall for a hundred leagues.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但他不确定的是，他们向西或向东偏离了多远。最终会到达长城，没错…也许一天，也许半月，不可能更久，肯定，肯定…但具体到哪儿呢？需要找的是黑城堡的门，一百里格沿线只有那里可以穿越。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“长城真的像卡斯特说的那么大吗？”吉莉问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Wall is three hundred miles long and seven hundred feet high, Sam reminded himself. If they kept going south, they had to find it, sooner or later. And he was certain that they had been going south. By day he took directions from the sun, and on clear nights they could follow the Ice Dragon's tail, though they hadn't traveled much by night since the second horse had died. Even when the moon was full it was too dark beneath the trees, and it would have been so easy for Sam or the last garron to break a leg. We have to be well south by now, we have to be.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="长城有三百里长，七百尺高，山姆提醒自己。如果一直往南，迟早会撞见它——而他们确实在往南，至少这点他非常确定。白天根据太阳辨别方向，晴朗的晚上，则可以追随冰龙星座的尾巴，虽然自另一匹马死后，他们便很少在夜间行路。就算月圆时分，林子里也太过黑暗，山姆或者最后一匹马很容易摔断腿。我们一定已到了很南的地方，一定是的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Bigger." Sam tried to sound cheerful. "So big you can't even see the castles hidden behind it. But they're there, you'll see. The Wall is all ice, but the castles are stone and wood. There are tall towers and deep vaults and a huge longhall with a great fire burning in the hearth, day and night. It's so hot in there, Gilly, you'll hardly believe it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“比他说的还大，”山姆试图让语气愉快一些，“大得让你看不见藏在后面的城堡，而城堡本身就已经够大了，你会明白的。长城完全由冰筑成，城堡则是木石结构，高高的塔楼，深深的地窖，还有壁炉里日夜燃烧着熊熊烈火的硕大长厅。很热，很暖和，吉莉，热到你无法相信。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You can stand by the fire as long as you like. You'll have food and drink, too. Hot mulled wine and a bowl of venison stewed with onions, and Hobb's bread right out of the oven, so hot it will burn your fingers." Sam peeled a glove off to wriggle his own fingers near the flames, and soon regretted it. They had been numb with cold, but as feeling returned they hurt so much he almost cried. "Sometimes one of the brothers will sing," he said, to take his mind off the pain. "Dareon sang best, but they sent him to Eastwatch. There's still Halder, though. And Toad. His real name is Todder, but he looks like a toad, so we call him that. He likes to sing, but he has an awful voice."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你想站多久就站多久，还有食物和饮料。温热的葡萄酒、一碗洋葱炖鹿肉，外加哈布刚出炉的面包，热得烫手。”山姆摘下手套，在火焰旁活动手指——他很快后悔起自己的举动，它们本来冻得麻木，随着知觉恢复，疼痛教他差点哭出来。“弟兄们有时会唱歌，”他说，以便将注意力从指头的疼痛中转移，“戴利恩唱得最好，他们因此派他去了东海望。不过能唱的还有霍德和‘癞蛤蟆’——他真名陶德，但长得像癞蛤蟆，因此我们这么叫他。他喜欢唱，可嗓音太糟。”">查看中文翻译</div>

A biting wind was blowing from the north, and the leaves in the trees rattled at him as he passed. He had to break the thin scum of ice on top of the stream so the horse could get a drink. I had better bring her inside. He did not want to wake up at break of day to find that their horse had frozen to death during the night. Gilly would keep going even if that happened. The girl was very brave, not like him. He wished he knew what he was going to do with her back at Castle Black. She kept saying how she'd be his wife if he wanted, but black brothers didn't keep wives; besides, he was a Tarly of Horn Hill, he could never wed a wildling. I'll have to think of something.

He liked sleeping next to her. it made him remember times long past, when he had shared a huge bed at Hom Hill with two of his sisters. That had ended when Lord Randyll decided it was making him soft as a girl. Sleeping alone in my own cold cell never made me any harder or braver, though. He wondered what his father would say if he could see him now. I killed one of the Others, my lord, he imagined saying. I stabbed him with an obsidian dagger, and my Sworn Brothers call me Sam the Slayer now But even in his fancies, Lord Randyll only scowled, disbelieving.</div>

Lord Mormont too, the Old Bear, and Grerm and Dolorous Edd and Pyp and Toad and all his other brothers from the Watch, but they wore bright colors instead of black. Sam sat at the high table and feasted them all, cutting thick slices off a roast with his father's greatsword Heartsbane. There were sweet cakes to eat and honeyed wine to drink, there was singing and dancing, and everyone was warm. When the feast was done he went up to sleep; not to the lord's bedchamber where his mother and father lived but to the room he had once shared with his sisters.

The wight did not seem to fear the dragonglass. Perhaps he did not know what it was. He moved slowly, but Small Paul had never been quick even when he'd been alive. Behind him, Gilly murmured to calm the garron and tried to urge it toward the door. But the horse must have caught a whiff of the wight's queer cold scent.

<div class="line_en">There was no time to think or pray or be afraid. Samwell Tarly threw himself forward and plunged the dagger down into Small Paul's back. Half-turned, the wight never saw him coming. The raven gave a shriek and took to the air. "You're dead!" Sam screamed as he stabbed. "You're dead, you're dead."

<div class="line_en">Sam's wail made a white mist in the black air. He dropped the useless hilt and took a hasty step backwards as Small Paul twisted around. Before he could get out his other knife, the steel knife that every brother carried, the wight's black hands locked beneath his chins. Paul's fingers were so cold they seemed to burn. They burrowed deep into the soft flesh of Sam's throat. Run, Gilly, run, he wanted to scream, but when he opened his mouth only a choking sound emerged.</div>

He punched and pulled at the wight's wrists, to no avail. He kicked Paul between the legs, uselessly. The world shrank to two blue stars, a terrible crushing pain, and a cold so fierce that his tears froze over his eyes. Sam squirmed and pulled, desperate… and then he lurched forward.</div>

The sudden shift sent Paul staggering back a step, and the living man and the dead one went crashing down together. The impact knocked one hand from Sam's throat, and he was able to suck in a quick breath of air before the icy black fingers returned. The taste of blood filled his mouth. He twisted his neck around, looking for his knife, and saw a dull orange glow. The fire! Only ember and ashes remained, but still… he could not breathe, or think… Sam wrenched himself sideways, pulling Paul with him… his arms flailed against the dirt floor, groping, reaching, scattering the ashes, until at last they found something hot… a chunk of charred wood, smouldering red and orange within the black… his fingers closed around it, and he smashed it into Paul's mouth, so hard he felt teeth shatter.</div>

Sam Tarly turned the color of curdled milk, and his eyes went wide as plates. Ravens! They were in the weirwood, hundreds of them, thousands, perched on the bone-white branches, peering between the leaves. He saw their beaks open as they screamed, saw them spread their black wings.
