<div class="line_en">He was the youngest son of his father, a poor parson at the other end of the county, and had arrived at Talbothays Dairy as a six months' pupil, after going the round of some other farms, his object being to acquire a practical skill in the various processes of farming, with a view either to the Colonies, or the tenure of a home-farm, as circumstances might decide.</div>

<div class="line_en">Angel Clare rises out of the past not altogether as a distinct figure, but as an appreciative voice, a long regard of fixed, abstracted eyes, and a mobility of mouth somewhat too small and delicately lined for a man's, though with an unexpectedly firm close of the lower lip now and then; enough to do away with any inference of indecision. Nevertheless, something nebulous, preoccupied, vague, in his bearing and regard, marked him as one who probably had no very definite aim or concern about his material future. Yet as a lad people had said of him that he was one who might do anything if he tried.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从往日的回忆中显现出来的安棋尔·克莱尔先生，并不完全是一个清晰的形象，而是一种富有欣赏力的声音，一种凝视和出神眼睛的长久注视，一种生动的嘴唇，那嘴唇有时候对一个男人来说太小，线条太纤细，虽然他的下唇有时叫人意想不到地闭得紧紧的，但是这已足够叫人打消对他不够果断的推论。尽管如此，在他的神态和目光里，隐藏着某种混乱、模糊和心不在焉的东西，叫人一看就知道他这个人也许对未来的物质生活，既没有明确的目标，也不怎么关心。可是当他还是一个少年的时候，人们就说过，他是那种想做什么就能把什么做好的人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Some two or three years before Angel's appearance at the Marlott dance, on a day when he had left school and was pursuing his studies at home, a parcel came to the vicarage from the local bookseller's, directed to the Reverend James Clare. The vicar having opened it and found it to contain a book, read a few pages; whereupon he jumped up from his seat and went straight to the shop with the book under his arm.</div>

This lady had somewhat unexpectedly brought him three sons, so that between Angel, the youngest, and his father the vicar there seemed to be almost a missing generation.

And if Angel were not going to enter the Church, what was the use of sending him to Cambridge? The University as a step to anything but ordination seemed, to this man of fixed ideas, a preface without a volume.

<div class="line_en">Perhaps if Angel had persevered he might have gone to Cambridge like his brothers. But the Vicar's view of that seat of learning as a stepping-stone to Orders alone was quite a family tradition; and so rooted was the idea in his mind that perseverance began to appear to the sensitive son akin to an intent to misappropriate a trust, and wrong the pious heads of the household, who had been and were, as his father had hinted, compelled to exercise much thrift to carry out this uniform plan of education for the three young men.</div>

<div class="line_en">The effects of this decisive debate were not long in showing themselves. He spent years and years in desultory studies, undertakings, and meditations; he began to evince considerable indifference to social forms and observances. The material distinctions of rank and wealth he increasingly despised. Even the 'good old family' (to use a favourite phrase of a late local worthy) had no aroma for him unless there were good new resolutions in its representatives. As a balance to these austerities, when he went to live in London to see what the world was like, and with a view to practising a profession or business there, he was carried off his head, and nearly entrapped by a woman much older than himself, though luckily he escaped not greatly the worse for the experience.</div>

<div class="line_en">Early association with country solitudes had bred in him an unconquerable, and almost unreasonable, aversion to modern life, and shut him out from such success as he might have aspired to by following a mundane calling in the impracticability of the spiritual one. But something had to be done; he had wasted many valuable years; and having an acquaintance who was starting on a thriving life as a Colonial farmer, it occurred to Angel that this might be a lead in the right direction. Farming, either in the Colonies, America, or at home -- farming, at any rate, after becoming well qualified for the business by a careful apprenticeship -- that was a vocation which would probably afford an independence without the sacrifice of what he valued even more than a competency -- intellectual liberty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的幼年生活同乡村幽静生活的联系，使他对现代城市生活生出一种不可抑制的几乎是非理性的厌恶来，因此也使他同另一种成功隔离开来，使他既不愿从事精神方面的工作，也不愿立志追求一种世俗的职业。但是他不能不做一件工作；他已经虚度了许多年的宝贵光阴；后来认识了一个在殖民地务农而发达起来的朋友，因此他想到这也许是一条正确的途径。在殖民地，在美国，或者在国内务农——通过认真地学习务农，无论如何，在学会了这件事之后——也许务农是使他得到独立的一种职业，而不用牺牲他看得比可观的财产更为宝贵的东西，即精神自由。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So we find Angel Clare at six-and-twenty here at Talbothays as a student of kine, and, as there were no houses near at hand in which he could get a comfortable lodging, a boarder at the dairyman's. His room was an immense attic which ran the whole length of the dairy-house. It could only be reached by a ladder from the cheese-loft, and had been closed up for a long time till he arrived and selected it as his retreat. Here Clare had plenty of space, and could often be heard by the dairy-folk pacing up and down when the household had gone to rest. A portion was divided off at one end by a curtain, behind which was his bed, the outer part being furnished as a homely sitting-room.</div>

<div class="line_en">Much to his surprise he took, indeed, a real delight in their companionship. The conventional farm-folk of his imagination -- personified in the newspaper-press by the pitiable dummy known as Hodge -- were obliterated after a few days' residence. At close quarters no Hodge was to be seen. At first, it is true, when Clare's intelligence was fresh from a contrasting society, these friends with whom he now hobnobbed seemed a little strange. Sitting down as a level member of the dairyman's household seemed at the outset an undignified proceeding. The ideas, the modes, the surroundings, appeared retrogressive and unmeaning. But with living on there, day after day, the acute sojourner became conscious of a new aspect in the spectacle. Without any objective change whatever, variety had taken the place of monotonousness. His host and his host's household, his men and his maids, as they became intimately known to Clare, began to differentiate themselves as in a chemical process. The thought of Pascal's was brought home to him: `A mesure qu'on a plus d'esprit, on trouve qu'il y a plus d'hommes originaux. Les gens du commun ne trouvent pas de difference entre les hommes.' The typical and unvarying Hodge ceased to exist. He had been disintegrated into a number of varied fellow-creatures -- beings of many minds, beings infinite in difference; some happy, many serene, a few depressed, one here and there bright even to genius, some stupid, others wanton, others austere; some mutely Miltonic, some potentially Cromwellian; into men who had private views of each other, as he had of his friends; who could applaud or condemn each other, amuse or sadden themselves by the contemplation of each other's foibles or vices; men every one of whom walked in his own individual way the road to dusty death.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="使他大感意外的是，他的确真的喜欢与他们为伍了。他想象中的世俗农夫——报纸上所说的典型人物，著名的可怜笨伯霍吉——他住下来没有几天就从他心中消失了。同他们一接近，霍吉是不存在的。说真的，起初克莱尔从一个完全不同的社会来到这里，他感到同他朝夕相处的这些朋友呆在一起似乎有点儿异样。作为奶牛场老板一家人中的一个平等成员坐在一起，他在开头还觉得有失身分。他们的思想观念、生活方式和周围的环境似乎都是落后的、毫无意义的。但是他在那儿住下来，同他们天天生活在一起，于是寄居在这儿的这个眼光敏锐的人，就开始认识到这群平常人身上的全新的一面。虽然他看到的人并没有发生什么变化，但是丰富多采已经取代了单调乏味。老板和老板娘、男工和女工都变成了克莱尔熟悉的朋友，他们像发生化学变化一样开始显示出各自不同的特点。他开始想到帕斯卡说过的话：“一个人自身的心智越高，就越能发现别人的独特之处。平庸的人是看不出人与人之间的差别的。”①那种典型的没有变化的霍吉已经不存在了。他已经分化了，融进了大量的各色各样的人中间去了——成了一群思想丰富的人，一群差别无穷的人；有些人快乐，多数人沉静，还有几个人心情忧郁，其间也有聪明程度达到天才的人，也有一些人愚笨，有些人粗俗，有些人质朴；有些人是沉默无声的弥尔顿式的人物，有些人则是锋芒毕露的克伦威尔式的人物②；他们就像他认识自己的朋友一样，相互之间都有着自己的看法；他们也会相互赞扬，或者相互指责，或者因为想到各自的弱点或者缺点而感到好笑和难过；他们都按照各自的方式在通往尘土的死亡道路上走着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At first he lived up above entirely, reading a good deal, and strumming upon an old harp which he had bought at a sale, saying when in a bitter humour that he might have to get his living by it in the streets some day. But he soon preferred to read human nature by taking his meals downstairs in the general dining-kitchen, with the dairyman and his wife, and the maids and men, who all together formed a lively assembly; for though but few milking hands slept in the house, several joined the family at meals. The longer Clare resided here the less objection had he to his company, and the more did he like to share quarters with them in common.</div>

<div class="line_en">Unexpectedly he began to like the outdoor life for its own sake, and for what it brought, apart from its bearing on his own proposed career. He grew away from old associations, and saw something new in life and humanity. Secondarily, he made close acquaintance with phenomena which he had before known but darkly -- the seasons in their moods, morning and evening, night and noon, winds in their different tempers, trees, waters and mists, shades and silences, and the voices of inanimate things.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他同过去的联系越来越少了，在人生和人类中间发现了一些新的东西。其次，他对过上只是模模糊糊地知道的外界现象更加熟悉了——如四季的变幻、清晨和傍晚、黑夜和正午、不同脾性的风、树木、水流、雾气、幽暗、静寂，还有许多无生命事物的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The early mornings were still sufficiently cool to render a fire acceptable in the large room wherein they breakfasted; and, by Mrs Crick's orders, who held that he was too genteel to mess at their table, it was Angel Clare's custom to sit in the yawning chimney-corner during the meal, his cup-and-saucer and plate being placed on a hinged flap at his elbow. The light from the long, wide, mullioned window opposite shone in upon his nook, and, assisted by a secondary light of cold blue quality which shone down the chimney, enabled him to read there easily whenever disposed to do so. Between Clare and the window was the table at which his companions sat, their munching profiles rising sharp against the panes; while to the side was the milk-house door, through which were visible the rectangular leads in rows, full to the brim with the morning's milk. At the further end the great churn could be seen revolving, and its slip-slopping heard -- the moving power being discernible through the window in the form of a spiritless horse walking in a circle and driven by a boy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="清早的气温仍然凉得很，所以在他们吃早饭的那间大房子里生上了火，大家感到适意；克里克太太认为克莱尔温文尔雅，不宜于坐在他们的桌子上同大家在一起吃饭，就吩咐让人把他的盘子和一套杯子和碟子摆在一块用铰链连起米的搁板上，所以吃饭的时候他总是坐在大张着口的壁炉旁边。阳光从对面那个又长又宽的直棂窗户里射进来，照亮了他坐的那个角落，壁炉的烟囱里也有一道冷蓝色的光线照进来，每当想要读书的时候，他就可以在那儿舒舒服服地读书了。在克莱尔和窗户中间，有一张他的伙伴们坐着吃饭的桌子，他们咀嚼东西的身影清清楚楚地映在窗户的玻璃上；房子一边是奶房的门，从门里面看进去，可以看见一排长方形的铅桶，里面装满了早晨挤出来的牛奶。在更远的一头，可以看见搅黄油的奶桶在转动着，也听得见搅黄油的声音——从窗户里看过去，可以看出奶桶是由一匹马拉着转动的，那是一匹没精打采的马，在一个男孩的驱赶下绕着圈走着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For several days after Tess's arrival Clare, sitting abstractedly reading from some book, periodical, or piece of music just come by post, hardly noticed that she was present at table. She talked so little, and the other maids talked so much, that the babble did not strike him as possessing a new note, and he was ever in the habit of neglecting the particulars of an outward scene for the general impression. One day, however, when he had been conning one of his music-scores, and by force of imagination was hearing the tune in his head, he lapsed into listlessness, and the music-sheet rolled to the hearth. He looked at the fire of logs, with its one flame pirouetting on the top in a dying dance after the breakfast-cooking and boiling, and it seemed to jig to his inward tune; also at the two chimney crooks dangling down from the cotterer or cross-bar, plumed with soot which quivered to the same melody; also at the half-empty kettle whining an accompaniment. The conversation at the table mixed in with his phantasmal orchestra till he thought: 'What a fluty voice one of those milkmaids has! I suppose it is the new one.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在苔丝来后的好几天里，克莱尔老是坐在那儿聚精会神地读书，读杂志，或者是读他刚收到的邮局寄来的乐谱，几乎没有注意到桌子上苔丝的出现。苔丝说话不多，其他的女孩子又说话太多，所以在那一片喧哗里，他心里没有留下多了一种新的说话声的印象，而且他也只习惯于获得外界的大致印象，而不太注意其中的细节。但是有一天，他正在熟悉一段乐谱，并在头脑里集中了他的全部想象力欣赏这段乐谱的时候，突然走了神，乐谱掉到了带炉的边上。那时已经做完了早饭，烧过了开水，他看见燃烧的木头只剩下一点火苗还在跳动着，快要熄火了，似乎在和着他内心的旋律跳吉尔舞；他还看见从壁炉的横梁或十字架上垂下来的两根挂钩，钩子沾满了烟灰，也和着同样的旋律颤抖着；钩子上的水壶已经空了一半，在用低声的倾诉和着旋律伴奏。桌子上的谈话混合在他幻想中的管弦乐曲里，他心里想：“在这些挤奶女工中间，有一个姑娘的声音多么清脆悦耳呀！我猜想这是一个新来的人的声音。”">查看中文翻译</div>
