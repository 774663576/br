<div class="line_en">Elsa's birthday was always extremely important to Granny. Maybe because Elsa's birthday is two days after Christmas Eve and Christmas Eve, when most people celebrate the holiday, is very important to everyone else, and as a result no child with a birthday two days after Christmas Eve ever gets quite the same amount of attention as a child born in August or April. So Granny had a tendency to overcompensate. Mum had banned her from planning surprise parties, after that time Granny let off fireworks inside a hamburger restaurant and accidentally set fire to a seventeen-year-old girl who was dressed up as a clown and apparently supposed to be providing "entertainment for the children." She really was entertaining, Elsa should say in her defense. That day, Elsa learned some of her very best swearwords.</div>

<div class="line_en">It's a bit tricky to explain, but some things in Granny's fairy tales are like that. You have to understand, first of all, that no creature in the Land-of-Almost-Awake is sadder than the sea-angel, and it's actually only once Elsa remembers this whole story that Granny's treasure hunt begins to make sense.</div>

<div class="line_en">The thing is, in Miamas you don't get presents on your birthday. You give presents. Preferably something you have at home and are very fond of, which you then give to someone you like even more. That's why everyone in Miamas looks forward to other people's birthdays, and that's the origin of the expression "What do you get from someone who has everything?" When the enphants took this fairy tale into the real world, someone here managed to get the wrong end of the stick, of course, making it "What do you GIVE to someone who has everything?" But what else would you expect? These are the same muppets who managed to misinterpret the word "interpret," which means something completely different in Miamas. In Miamas an interpreter is a creature most easily described as a combination between a goat and a chocolate cookie. Interpreters are extremely gifted linguistically, as well as excellent to grill on the barbecue. At least they were until Elsa became a vegetarian, after which Granny was not allowed to mention them anymore.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="事情是这样的，在密阿玛斯生日这天你不收礼物，而是给别人送礼物。最好是你家里有的、自己很喜欢的东西，然后就把它送给你更加喜欢的人。这就是为什么密阿玛斯的每个人都期待其他人的生日，也是“你从拥有一切的人那里得到了什么”这句话的由来。当蚁象把这个童话故事带去现实世界后，这里的人弄反了，把这句话变成了“你给拥有一切的人送了什么”。还有什么指望呢？同样是这些笨蛋曲解了“口译”这个词的意思，它在密阿玛斯的意思完全不同。简单来说，在密阿玛斯，“口译者”是一种羊和巧克力饼干结合的生物。它们有非常高的语言天赋，烤起来也很好吃。至少在爱莎成为素食主义者之前，的确是这样的。不过那之后，外婆就再也不提它们了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Elsa was five and about to turn six when she read about it online for the first time. On her sixth birthday, Granny told her the story of the sea-angel. To teach her that not all monsters are monsters in the beginning, and not all monsters look like monsters. Some carry their monstrosity inside.</div>

<div class="line_en">Anyway: so Elsa was born two days after Christmas Eve almost eight years ago, the same day that the scientists registered the gamma radiation from that magnetar. The other thing that happened that day was a tsunami in the Indian Ocean. Elsa knows that this is a sickeningly big wave caused by an earthquake. Except sort of at sea. So more like an ocean-quake, really, if you want to be persnickety about it. And Elsa is quite persnickety.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不管怎样，爱莎是在八年前的圣诞节过后两天出生的，也就是科学家记录下磁星放出伽玛射线的同一天。那天发生的另一件事是印度洋海啸。爱莎知道那是一波特别大的地震引起的，只不过是在海上。所以，它更像一场海洋地震，真的，如果你吹毛求疵的话。爱莎挺容易吹毛求疵的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The very last thing the shadows did before the ending of the War-Without-End was to destroy all of Mibatalos, the kingdom where all the warriors had been brought up. But then came Wolfheart and the wurses, and everything turned, and when the shadows fled the Land-of-Almost-Awake they charged out over the sea with terrible force from all the coastlines of the six kingdoms. And their imprint on the surface of the water stirred up hideous waves, which, one by one, smashed into each other until they had formed a single wave as high as the eternity of ten thousand fairy tales. And to stop anyone pursuing the shadows, the wave turned and threw itself back in towards land.</div>

<div class="line_en">Since then, the angel had drifted up and down the coast, burdened by a curse that prevented it from leaving the place that had taken away all those it loved. It did this for so long that the people in the villages along the coast forgot who it used to be and started calling it "the sea-angel" instead. And as the years went by, the angel was buried deeper and deeper in an avalanche of sorrow, until its heart split in two and then its whole body split, like a shattered mirror. When the children from the villages sneaked down to the coast to catch a glimpse of it, one moment they might see a face of such beauty it took their breath away; but in the next, they would see something so terrible and deformed and wild looking back at them that they would run screaming all the way home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从那天起，那位天使就沿着海岸随波逐流，身中诅咒——无法离开这个带走她心爱之人的地方。时间久了，海岸沿线的人们忘记了她是谁，开始称之为“海天使”。随着岁月的流逝，天使在悲伤中越陷越深，直到她的心裂成两半，然后她的身体四分五裂，像一面破碎的镜子。村子里的孩子们溜去海岸边偷看她，某个瞬间他们也许会看到一张美得令人窒息的容颜；但下一秒，就会变成一张可怕、畸形、粗野的脸回望着他们，吓得他们尖叫着跑回家。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Later that night Elsa sits on the top step outside Granny's flat until the ceiling lights switch themselves off. Runs her finger over Granny's writing on the envelope again and again, but doesn't open it. Just puts it in her backpack and stretches out on the cold floor and mostly keeps her eyes closed. Tries one more time to get off to Miamas. She lies there for hours without succeeding. Stays there until she hears the main door at the bottom of the house opening and closing again. She lies on the floor and mostly keeps her eyes closed until she feels the night embracing the windows of the house and hears the drunk start rattling around with something a couple floors farther down.</div>

And then Granny used to chime in, "Tired? Hell yeah, of course you get tired when you're up boozing all night!"

Elsa realizes there has probably never been anyone there, and that's not an easy thing for an almost-eight-year-old to understand. Granny told many fairy tales about many things, but never about women in black skirts pretending to have telephone conversations while they went up the stairs, so their neighbors wouldn't think they'd bought all that wine for themselves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的耳朵里还塞着她总对着里头说话的白色耳机，但另一头荡在她的胯部，并没有连着手机。爱莎意识到，也许她从未跟任何人通话。一个快八岁的孩子能明白这一点颇为不易。外婆讲过很多童话故事，谈论过很多事，但从未说过这种故事：黑裙女人假装在上楼时讲电话，为了不让她的邻居觉得她买的所有酒都是给自己喝的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Elsa curls up in her arms in the dark, and they see the woman in the black skirt drifting back and forth down there like a flag that's torn itself free in the wind. Plastic bags lie scattered on the floor of her flat. One of the wine boxes has toppled over. A few last drops of red are dripping onto the parquet floor. Mum makes a gentle movement against Elsa's hand. They stand up quietly and go back up the stairs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱莎在黑暗中蜷成一团，她们看着那黑裙女人来来回回地游荡，就像一面旗子在风中撕扯着自己。塑料袋散落在她公寓房内的地上，其中一个酒盒翻了，最后的几滴红酒滴在木地板上。妈妈轻轻捏了一下爱莎的手。她们安静地起身，走上楼梯。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And that night Elsa's mum tells Elsa what everyone except Elsa's parents was talking about on the day Elsa was born. About a wave that broke over a beach five thousand miles away and crushed everything in its path. About two boys who swam out after their father and never came back.</div>
