"Come around where I can see you," I order.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我刚才走过来时并没有看到她，她一定是藏在屋子里，而我的目光一直盯着我的目标。也许这个人有武器，但我肯定她并不敢冒险让我听到子弹上膛的声音，因为当我得知自己受到死亡威胁时，就会杀死她的同伴。“走过来，让我能看到你。”我命令道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There's a step and a dragging sound. I can hear the effort the movement requires. Another woman, or maybe I should call her a girl since she looks about my age, limps into view. She's dressed in an ill-fitting Peacekeeper's uniform complete with the white fur cloak, but it's several sizes too large for her slight frame. She carries no visible weapon. Her hands are occupied with steadying a rough crutch made from a broken branch. The toe of her right boot can't clear the snow, hence the dragging.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我同时听到踏步和拖着脚走路的声音，从声音可以听出她走起来很吃力。这时，一个女人…也许应该叫女孩，因为她和我年龄相仿，进入我的视线。她穿着治安警的制服，身披白色皮毛斗篷，但衣服比她娇小的身材大了好几号，看上去很不合体。看样子，她没有携带武器，她双手扶着用折断的树枝做的拐杖，尽力保持着身体的平衡，她穿着靴子的右脚抬不起来，所以她才拖着脚走。">查看中文翻译</div>

Then I hesitate a moment, thinking of another day in this woods, when Gale and I watched a hovercraft appear out of thin air and capture two escapees from the Capitol. The boy was speared and killed. The redheaded girl, I found out when I went to the Capitol, was mutilated and turned into a mute servant called an Avox. "Anyone after you?"</div>

She holds her hands to the feeble flame that burns on one end of a charred log. Her skin is so pale as to be translucent and I can see the fire glow through her flesh. Twill tries to arrange the cloak, which must have been her own, around the shivering girl.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="邦妮点点头。“我们把能吃的都吃了，可粮食太少了，已经有一段时间了。”她颤抖的声音打消了我最后的一丝戒备之心。她只不过是一个要逃离凯匹特的杀害，一个营养不良的、受伤的女孩。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">From the bag I pull two fresh buns with a layer of cheese baked into the top. We always seem to have a supply of these since Peeta found out they were my favorite.

<div class="line_en">"Well, then this is your lucky day," I say, dropping my game bag on the floor. People are starving all over the district and we still have more than enough. So I've been spreading things around a little. I have my own priorities: Gale's family, Greasy Sae, some of the other Hob traders who were shut down. My mother has other people, patients mostly, who she wants to help. This morning I purposely overstuffed my game bag with food, knowing my mother would see the depleted pantry and assume I was making my rounds to the hungry. I was actually buying time to go to the lake without her worrying. I intended to deliver the food this evening on my return, but now I can see that won't be happening.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那，今天你可走运了。”我说着，把装猎物的袋子放到地上。全区的人都在挨饿，可我们的食物却吃不完，所以我常常会接济别的人家。我也有首先需要考虑的：盖尔家、格雷西塞，还有一些因黑市关闭而不能再做生意的人家。妈妈也会接济其他一些人，往往是她的病人。今天，我特意在袋子里多装了些吃的，妈妈看见厨房的食品拿走不少，就知道我又去接济别人啦。我实际上悄悄去了湖边，我不想让她担心。我本打算今晚回去时把食物分发出去，可依现在的情况看，这不可能了。">查看中文翻译</div>

"It's better if you chew it." She nods, trying to slow down, but I know how hard it is when you're that hollow. "I think your tea's done." I scoot the tin can from the ashes. Twill finds two tin cups in her pack and I dip out the tea, setting it on the floor to cool. They huddle together, eating, blowing on their tea, and taking tiny, scalding sips as I build up the fire. I wait until they are sucking the grease from their fingers to ask, "So, what's your story?" And they tell me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“思，吃吧。”我说。邦妮举起面包，好像不敢相信是真的，然后大口大口地吃起来。“你要是嚼一嚼，味道会更好。”她点点头，尽力想慢下来，可我知道，腹中饥饿时，这有多难。“我想你们的茶煮好了。”我把罐头盒从火里拉出来，特瑞尔在她的背包里拿出两个锡碗，我把罐头盒里的“茶叶”弄出去，放在地上等着它凉。她们俩蜷缩在一起，边吃边吹茶，小口地喝着，我在一旁生火。我一直等她们吃完，已经开始嗍着手指头上的油脂时，我才开口问道：“喏，给我说说你们的事吧。”这时她们才把自己的故事向我一一道来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ever since the Hunger Games, the discontent in District 8 had been growing. It was always there, of course, to some degree. But what differed was that talk was no longer sufficient, and the idea of taking action went from a wish to a reality. The textile factories that service Panem are loud with machinery, and the din also allowed word to pass safely, a pair of lips close to an ear, words unnoticed, unchecked. Twill taught at school, Bonnie was one of her pupils, and when the final bell had rung, both of them spent a four-hour shift at the factory that specialized in the Peacekeeper uniforms. It took months for Bonnie, who worked in the chilly inspection dock, to secure the two uniforms, a boot here, a pair of pants there. They were intended for Twill and her husband because it was understood that, once the uprising began, it would be crucial to get word of it out beyond District 8 if it were to spread and be successful.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="自从举办饥饿游戏以来，八区的不满情绪就越来越强烈。当然，这种不满是早已存在的。但渐渐地，人们已不满足于口头抱怨，而要采取行动，他们要把自己的意愿变为现实。八区的纺织厂整日轰鸣，而噪声是很好的掩护，大家只要把嘴凑近耳边，就可以安全传递消息，不被察觉，也不会被审查。特瑞尔在学校教书，邦妮是她的学生，下课以后，她们要到生产警服的服装厂上四个小时的班。邦妮在寒冷的服装检测车间干活，她花了好几个月的时间，才设法藏起了两套制服，又在其他地方藏起了靴子和裤子。这些是为特瑞尔和她丈夫准备的，大家心里明白，一旦发生暴动，能否把消息传递出去对于暴动能否成功、其他辖区能否响应至关重要。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The night of my engagement, the night Peeta fell to his knees and proclaimed his undying love for me in front of the cameras in the Capitol, was the night the uprising began. It was an ideal cover. Our Victory Tour interview with Caesar Flickerman was mandatory viewing. It gave the people of District 8 a reason to be out on the streets after dark, gathering either in the square or in various community centers around the city to watch. Ordinarily such activity would have been too suspicious. Instead everyone was in place by the appointed hour, eight o'clock, when the masks went on and all hell broke loose.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当皮塔在凯匹特单膝跪地，在摄像机前向我表白爱情的当晚，八区就发生了暴动。那晚的活动为他们提供了很好的掩护。凯撒弗里克曼对我们的采访是政府要求必须观看的节目，所以八区的老百姓可以理所当然地在夜间外出，聚集在广场或其他有通讯设施的地方观看节目。如果是在平时，这样的行动就太可疑了。因此，大家在约定时间—八点钟，进入预定位置，当化装舞会气氛正浓时，一场天翻地覆的暴动也爆发了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The day Peeta and I came through and made our Victory Tour appearance was actually a rehearsal of sorts. People in the crowd positioned themselves according to their teams, next to the buildings they would target when the rebellion broke out. That was the plan: to take over the centers of power in the city like the Justice Building, the Peacekeepers' Headquarters, and the Communication Center in the square. And at other locations in the district: the railroad, the granary, the power station, and the armory.</div>

In the utter chaos that followed, it was all people could do to make it back to their homes alive. It took less than forty-eight hours to subdue the city. Then, for a week, there was a lockdown. No food, no coal, everyone forbidden to leave their homes. The only time the television showed anything but static was when the suspected instigators were hanged in the square. Then one night, as the whole district was on the brink of starvation, came the order to return to business as usual.</div>

<div class="line_en">The two fled back to Twill's, where the Peacekeeper suits were still waiting. They scraped together what provisions they could, stealing freely from neighbors they now knew to be dead, and made it to the railroad station. In a warehouse near the tracks, they changed into the Peacekeeper outfits and, disguised, were able to make it onto a boxcar full of fabric on a train headed to District 6. They fled the train at a fuel stop along the way and traveled on foot. Concealed by woods, but using the tracks for guidance, they made it to the outskirts of District 12 two days ago, where they were forced to stop when Bonnie twisted her ankle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是两个人逃回到特瑞尔家，制服还在那里，她们把所有吃的都装入包裹，又从死去的邻居那里偷了些东西，然后直奔火车站。在铁道旁的一间库房里，她们换上治安警的衣服，化了装，混上了一节火车车厢，车厢里装满了运往六区的纺织品。接着她们在火车加油时逃了出来，靠步行继续往前走。借助树林的掩护，她们沿轨道于两天前终于到了十二区边界，邦妮在那儿崴了脚，因而她们不得不停下来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">First I give them all the food in my pack, grain and dried beans mostly, but there's enough to hold them for a while if they're careful. Then I take Twill out in the woods and try to explain the basics of hunting. She's got a weapon that if necessary can convert solar energy into deadly rays of power, so that could last indefinitely. When she manages to kill her first squirrel, the poor thing is mostly a charred mess because it took a direct hit to the body. But I show her how to skin and clean it. With some practice, she'll figure it out. I cut a new crutch for Bonnie. Back at the house, I peel off an extra layer of socks for the girl, telling her to stuff them in the toes of her boots to walk, then wear them on her feet at night. Finally I teach them how to build a proper fire.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我把袋子里所有的食物都给了她们，有谷类食物，大部分都是干豆子，这些吃得精心些，够她们坚持一段时间。然后我带特瑞尔到林子里，教她一些捕捉猎物的基本技巧。她有一件长期使用的武器，必要时可以把太阳能转化成致命光束。她用这件武器打第一只松鼠时，光束直对松鼠，可怜的松鼠几乎被烧焦了。我还教她怎么剥皮、怎么去内脏。勤加练习，她最终是能自己摸索着学会的。我又给邦妮做了一副新拐杖。回到屋里，我又脱掉一层袜子给了邦妮，告诉她走路时把袜子塞在靴子头里，晚上睡觉时穿在脚上。最后，我教她怎样生火。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That snaps me to my senses. These are delusions. District 13 doesn't exist because the Capitol would never let it exist. They're probably mistaken about the footage. Mockingjays are about as rare as rocks. And about as tough. If they could survive the initial bombing of 13, they're probably doing better than ever now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说到这儿，我恍然醒悟。这些只不过是幻想和错觉。十三区不会存在，因为凯匹特从不允许它存在。她们说的电视片恐怕也是一种误解。嘲笑鸟跟地上的岩石一样随处可见，而且也很容易活。如果它们真的在最初轰炸十三区时存活下来，那么现在它们一定生长得非常茁壮了。">查看中文翻译</div>

He must have known that. So why visit my home, why order me to persuade the crowd of my love for Peeta?
