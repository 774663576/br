<div class="line_en">To the red country and part of the gray country of Oklahoma, the last rains came gently, and they did not cut the scarred earth. The plows crossed and recrossed the rivulet marks. The last rains lifted the corn quickly and scattered weed colonies and grass along the sides of the roads so that the gray country and the dark red country began to disappear under a green cover. In the last part of May the sky grew pale and the clouds that had hung in high puffs for so long in the spring were dissipated. The sun flared down on the growing corn day after day until a line of brown spread along the edge of each green bayonet. The clouds appeared, and went away, and in a while they did not try any more. The weeds grew darker green to protect themselves, and they did not spread any more. The surface of the earth crusted, a thin hard crust, and as the sky became pale, so the earth became pale, pink in the red country and white in the gray country.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the water-cut gullies the earth dusted down in dry little streams. Gophers and ant lions started small avalanches. And as the sharp sun struck day after day, the leaves of the young corn became less stiff and erect; they bent in a curve at first, and then, as the central ribs of strength grew weak, each leaf tilted downward. Then it was June, and the sun shone more fiercely. The brown lines on the corn leaves widened and moved in on the central ribs. The weeds frayed and edged back toward their roots. The air was thin and the sky more pale; and every day the earth paled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在雨水冲成的沟渠中，细土像流水似的直往下滚。土拨鼠和蚁狮一活动，尘土就像雪崩似的坍了下来。酷烈的太阳天天照射着，稚嫩的玉米叶子没有原先那样坚挺了，这些叶子起初变成弧形，随后因为叶脉逐渐虚弱的缘故，每片都斜倒下去。后来到了六月，阳光更为酷烈。玉米叶子上的棕色线条扩展到了叶脉上。连野草也蔫了，叶子朝根部搭拉下来。空气稀薄，天色更加灰白；大地也一天比一天变得灰白。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the roads where the teams moved, where the wheels milled the ground and the hooves of the horses beat the ground, the dirt crust broke and the dust formed. Every moving thing lifted the dust into the air: a walking man lifted a thin layer as high as his waist, and a wagon lifted the dust as high as the fence tops, and an automobile boiled a cloud behind it. The dust was long in settling back again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在车马往来、路面被车轮磨损和马蹄践踏的大路上，干结的泥块化成了尘埃。地面上的各种活动都会把尘土扬到空中：步行的人把薄薄的一层尘土扬到齐腰一般高，大车把它扬到篱笆顶端，汽车则在后面滚起一阵尘雾。这尘土很久才会落下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When June was half gone, the big clouds moved up out of Texas and the Gulf, high heavy clouds, rain-heads. The men in the fields looked up at the clouds and sniffed at them and held wet fingers up to sense the wind. And the horses were nervous while the clouds were up. The rain-heads dropped a little spattering and hurried on to some other country. Behind them the sky was pale again and the sun flared. In the dust there were drop craters where the rain had fallen, and there were clean splashes on the corn, and that was all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="六月过了一半，得克萨斯和墨西哥海湾的天空中泛起了大块大块的云，高高的、含雨的浓云。田野上的人们抬起头来望着这些云，用鼻子去闻一闻，伸出湿润的手指去辨辨风势。天上飘着云的时候，田野上的马都有些着慌。浓云洒下几点雨，便匆匆忙忙地转到别的地方去了。云飘走以后，天空又恢复了灰白色，太阳依旧像烈焰般照射着。只是尘埃中间雨点落到的地方有了一些凹穴，玉米上有了一些澄清的水珠。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A gentle wind followed the rain clouds, driving them on northward, a wind that softly clashed the drying corn. A day went by and the wind increased, steady, unbroken by gusts. The dust from the roads fluffed up and spread out and fell on the weeds beside the fields, and fell into the fields a little way. Now the wind grew strong and hard and it worked at the rain crust in the corn fields. Little by little the sky was darkened by the mixing dust, and the wind felt over the earth, loosened the dust, and carried it away. The wind grew stronger. The rain crust broke and the dust lifted up out of the fields and drove gray plumes into the air like sluggish smoke. The corn threshed the wind and made a dry, rushing sound. The finest dust did not settle back to earth now, but disappeared into the darkening sky.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一阵和风追随着雨云，把它们赶向北方，轻轻地吹动着正在干枯的玉米。一天过去了，风渐渐大了起来，但风势还很平稳，不是一阵阵的。大路上的尘埃飞扬起来，落在田边的野草上，落在附近的田地里。现在风更大了，刮着玉米地里雨后干结的地面。天空弥漫着尘土，愈来愈暗；风掠过大地，卷起尘土送往别处。风越刮越猛。雨后干结的地面裂了开来，田野上的尘土飞扬到空中，形成一道一道灰色的烟雾。玉米迎风扑打着，发出了呼啦啦的干涩声响。最细的尘土现在已不落回大地，而是消失在逐渐变暗的天空中了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The wind grew stronger, whisked under stones, carried up straws and old leaves, and even little clods, marking its course as it sailed across the fields. The air and the sky darkened and through them the sun shone redly, and there was a raw sting in the air. During a night the wind raced faster over the land, dug cunningly among the rootlets of the corn, and the corn fought the wind with its weakened leaves until the roots were freed by the prying wind and then each stalk settled wearily sideways toward the earth and pointed the direction of the wind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="风越刮越猛，在石头底下吹过，卷起稻草和枯叶，甚至还卷起小土块，在掠过田野的时候留下了它的踪迹。天空很昏暗，太阳已成了一团红光，空气中有一种刺人的阴冷感。夜里，风以更快的速度掠过地面；它在玉米的根脚间灵巧地掘着，玉米用它软弱了的叶子与风搏斗，直到根部被猛掀猛撬的风刮松了，于是每一根茎秆都横倒在地上，标志着风向。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The dawn came, but no day. In the gray sky a red sun appeared, a dim red circle that gave a little light, like dusk; and as that day advanced, the dusk slipped back toward darkness, and the wind cried and whimpered over the fallen corn.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黎明到来了，白昼却不露面。灰蒙蒙的天空出现了一轮红日，那只是一个朦胧的红色圆盘，放射出微弱的光线，好似黄昏一般；再过些时，阴暗的天色重新变成了一片漆黑，风在伏倒的玉米上呜呜地悲鸣。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When the night came again it was black night, for the stars could not pierce the dust to get down, and the window lights could not even spread beyond their own yards. Now the dust was evenly mixed with the air, an emulsion of dust and air. Houses were shut tight, and cloth wedged around doors and windows, but the dust came in so thinly that it could not be seen in the air, and it settled like pollen on the chairs and tables, on the dishes. The people brushed it from their shoulders. Little lines of dust lay at the door sills.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一到夜里更是漆黑一团，因为星光没法穿过尘沙照到地面，窗内的灯光甚至还照不出院落。现在，尘沙和空气匀称地搀杂在一起，成了尘沙和空气的混合物了。家家户户都紧关着门窗，用布塞住了缝隙，然而细得连肉眼也看不出的尘沙还是钻进来，像花粉一般停积在桌椅上和碟子上。人们从自己的肩膀上把尘土掸下来。门槛上也积聚着一行一行的尘沙。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the middle of that night the wind passed on and left the land quiet. The dust-filled air muffled sound more completely than fog does. The people, lying in their beds, heard the wind stop. They awakened when the rushing wind was gone. They lay quietly and listened deep into the stillness. Then the roosters crowed, and their voices were muffled, and the people stirred restlessly in their beds and wanted the morning. They knew it would take a long time for the dust to settle out of the air. In the morning the dust hung like fog, and the sun was as red as ripe new blood. All day the dust sifted down from the sky, and the next day it sifted down. An even blanket covered the earth. It settled on the corn, piled up on the tops of the fence posts, piled up on the wires; it settled on roofs, blanketed the weeds and trees.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="夜半，风止了，地面平静下来。尘沙弥漫的空气所起的隔音作用比雾还大。睡在床上的人听见风停了。他们是在大风平息之后醒来的。他们静静地躺在那里，在沉寂中凝神谛听。一会儿，鸡叫了，啼声也是沉闷闷的，人们在床上辗转反侧，巴望着天亮。他们知道空中的尘沙得经过好久才能澄清。早上，尘沙像雾一般笼罩着，太阳红得像鲜血一样。尘沙整天像从天空中筛下来一样，到第二天还是往下筛落，给大地铺了一床平整的毯子。这尘沙落在玉米上，积在篱笆顶上，堆在电线上；它也落在屋顶上，覆盖在野草和树木上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The people came out of their houses and smelled the hot stinging air and covered their noses from it. And the children came out of the houses, but they did not run or shout as they would have done after a rain. Men stood by their fences and looked at the ruined corn, drying fast now, only a little green showing through the film of dust. The men were silent and they did not move often. And the women came out of the houses to stand beside their men -- to feel whether this time the men would break. The women studied the men's faces secretly, for the corn could go, as long as something else remained. The children stood near by, drawing figures in the dust with bare toes, and the children sent exploring senses out to see whether men and women would break. The children peeked at the faces of the men and women, and then drew careful lines in the dust with their toes. Horses came to the watering troughs and nuzzled the water to clear the surface dust. After a while the faces of the watching men lost their bemused perplexity and became hard and angry and resistant. Then the women knew that they were safe and that there was no break. Then they asked, What'll we do? And the men replied, I don't know. But it was all right. The women knew it was all right, and the watching children knew it was all right. Women and children knew deep in themselves that no misfortune was too great to bear if their men were whole. The women went into the houses to their work, and the children began to play, but cautiously at first. As the day went forward the sun became less red. It flared down on the dust-blanketed land. The men sat in the doorways of their houses; their hands were busy with sticks and little rocks. The men sat still -- thinking -- figuring.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="人们从家里出来，嗅到了热辣辣的刺鼻的空气，赶紧掩住了鼻子。孩子们也从家里出来，却不像雨后那样奔跑着或是叫喊着。男人们站在他们的篱笆旁边，看着受灾的玉米正迅速地干枯下去，只有少许绿意从尘沙的障翳下透出来。他们沉默着，不大动弹。妇女们从家里出来，站在自己的男人身边——悄悄窥测他们这回是否会完全泄了气。妇女们偷偷地打量着男人们的脸色，只要他们不气馁，玉米没有收成也不要紧。孩子们站在旁边，用光着的脚趾头在尘沙上画着图，暗自留意着大人们是否会泄气。孩子们窥探着大人们的面孔，又用脚趾小心地划着线条。马儿来到水槽边，用鼻子拨开水面的尘沙喝水。过了一会儿，那些呆望的男人的脸上失去了迷惘的神态，变得勇敢、愤怒，有应付困难的决心了。于是妇女们知道她们已经平安无事，男人们不会泄气了。她们问道，我们怎么办呢？男人们回答说，我不知道。但是问题已经解决了。妇女们知道问题已经解决了，那些呆望着的孩子也知道问题已经解决了。妇女们和孩子们都深深地知道，只要家里的男人挺得住，他们就再没有忍受不住的灾难了。妇女们走进屋去做活，孩子们开始玩耍，但是起初玩得很小心。这一天太阳升得越高，它的红色也褪得越多。强烈的阳光照射着尘沙覆盖的土地。男人们坐在自己的家门口；他们手里拿着小树枝和小石头，忙着在地上写算。男人们静静地坐在那里——想着——算着。">查看中文翻译</div>
