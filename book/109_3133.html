<div class="line_en">Sitting, Ralph was aware of the heat for the first time that day. He pulled distastefully at his grey shirt and wondered whether he might undertake the adventure of washing it. Sitting under what seemed an unusual heat, even for this island, Ralph planned his toilet. He would like to have a pair of scissors and cut this hair -- he flung the mass back -- cut this filthy hair right back to half an inch. He would like to have a bath, a proper wallow with soap. He passed his tongue experimentally over his teeth and decided that a toothbrush would come in handy too. Then there were his nails -- Ralph turned his hand over and examined them. They were bitten down to the quick though he could not remember when he had restarted this habit nor any time when he indulged it.</div>

<div class="line_en">The pig-run kept close to the jumble of rocks that lay down by the water on the other side and Ralph was content to follow Jack along it. If you could shut your ears to the slow suck down of the sea and boil of the return, if you could forget how dun and unvisited were the ferny coverts on either side, then there was a chance that you might put the beast out of mind and dream for a while. The sun had swung over the vertical and the afternoon heat was closing in on the island. Ralph passed a message forward to Jack and when they next came to fruit the whole party stopped and ate.</div>

<div class="line_en">He looked round, furtively. Apparently no one had heard. The hunters sat, stuffing themselves with this easy meal, trying to convince themselves that they got sufficient kick out of bananas and that other olive-grey, jelly-like fruit. With the memory of his sometime clean self as a standard, Ralph looked them over. They were dirty, not with the spectacular dirt of boys who have fallen into mud or been brought down hard on a rainy day. Not one of them was an obvious subject for a shower, and yet -- hair, much too long, tangled here and there, knotted round a dead leaf or a twig; faces cleaned fairly well by the process of eating and sweating but marked in the less accessible angles with a kind of shadow; clothes, worn away, stiff like his own with sweat, put on, not for decorum or comfort but out of custom; the skin of the body, scurfy with brine -- He discovered with a little fall of the heart that these were the conditions he took as normal now and that he did not mind. He sighed and pushed away the stalk from which he had stripped the fruit. Already the hunters were stealing away to do their business in the woods or down by the rocks. He turned and looked out to sea.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他偷偷摸摸地朝四下看了看。显然没人听见他说话。猎手们坐着，正狼吞虎咽地吃着这种来得容易的饭食，他们试图使自己相信：香蕉，以及另一种淡青灰色的浆果，吃起来真是其乐无穷。拉尔夫记得自己有时候是很清洁的，用这样的标准，他把他们一个个打量过来。猎手们肮脏不堪，不是摔在泥地里浑身是泥浆的脏样，也不是大雨天给淋得像个落汤鸡似的狼狈相。他们没有一个十分明显地脏在外表，然而——头发太长，东缠西绕，裹着枯枝残叶；因为边吃边流汗，脸倒还算干净，但是从某些特别的角度，就看得出有黑黑的污垢；褴褛的衣衫，就像他自己穿的那件一样，因为汗水而弄得很僵硬，他们穿上衣服，既不是为了装饰，也不是为了舒适，只是出于习惯而已；孩子们赤裸的身上满是盐屑——拉尔夫发现自己现在对这种状况已习以为常，毫不介意，心头微微一沉。他叹了口气，推开他从上面剥下过野果的那根树梗。猎手们已经悄悄地跑开到树林子里或是跑到了山岩下面去干他们的营生了。他转过身去，放眼大海。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Wave after wave, Ralph followed the rise and fall until something of the remoteness of the sea numbed his brain. Then gradually the almost infinite size of this water forced itself on his attention. This was the divider, the barrier. On the other side of the island, swathed at midday with mirage, defended by the shield of the quiet lagoon, one might dream of rescue; but here, faced by the brute obtuseness of the ocean, the miles of division, one was clamped down, one was helpless, one was condemned, one was -- Simon was speaking almost in his ear. Ralph found that he had rock painfully gripped in both hands, found his body arched, the muscles of his neck stiff, his mouth strained open.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一浪紧接一浪，拉尔夫的目光追随着波涛起伏，直看到海洋的无边无际使他的头脑开始发晕。然后，几乎是无垠的海水又渐渐地迫使他集中起注意力。大海——这就是间隔和障壁。在岛屿的另一侧，正午时处在蜃景的包围中，宁静的环礁湖袒护着他们，谁都可以幻想得救；但是在这儿，面对着这蛮横而愚钝的大洋，面对着这茫无边际的隔绝，谁都会觉得束手无策，谁都会感到孤立无援，谁都会绝望，谁都会——西蒙几乎就在他耳边说起了话。拉尔夫发现西蒙痛苦地双手紧抓住岩石，弓着身体，挺直脖子，张大着嘴巴。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Here, on the other side of the island, the view was utterly different. The filmy enchantments of mirage could not endure the cold ocean water and the horizon was hard, clipped blue. Ralph wandered down to the rocks. Down here, almost on a level with the sea, you could follow with your eye the ceaseless, bulging passage of the deep sea waves. They were miles wide, apparently not breakers or the banked ridges of shallow water. They traveled the length of the island with an air of disregarding it and being set on other business; they were less a progress than a momentous rise and fall of the whole ocean. Now the sea would suck down, making cascades and waterfalls of retreating water, would sink past the rocks and plaster down the seaweed like shining hair: then, pausing, gather and rise with a roar, irresistibly swelling over point and outcrop, climbing the little cliff, sending at last an arm of surf up a gully to end a yard or so from him in fingers of spray.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这儿，在海岛的另一侧，景象迥然不同。经受不住冷冰冰的大洋水，海市蜃楼的朦胧魅力消失了，海平面轮廓清晰，蓝得刺眼。拉尔夫漫步走下山岩。在下面这儿，几乎跟大海同一个水平面上，可以放眼追随深海的涌浪滚滚向前。涌浪有好几英里宽，很明显可以看得出不是碎浪，也不是浅水处隆起的浪脊。涌浪横越过整个海岛，带着一种不屑一顾的气势，又开始了自己的征程；与其说涌浪滚滚向前，不如说整个大洋在惊心动魄地一起一伏。此刻海潮将要吸落下去，退却的海水白浪滔滔，形成了无数道大小瀑布，海水经过丛丛礁石而沉落，海藻紧贴着垂荡下去，就像闪闪发亮的头发；随后，稍停片刻，积聚起力量后，海潮又怒吼着起来，不可抗拒地涌上礁石尖儿和地层露头，爬上小岩，以一股拍岸激浪冲上海沟，最后在离拉尔夫一、二码的地方化为飞沫。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They set off again, the hunters bunched a little by fear of the mentioned beast, while Jack quested ahead. They went more slowly than Ralph had bargained for; yet in a way he was glad to loiter, cradling his spear. Jack came up against some emergency of his craft and soon the procession stopped. Ralph leaned against a tree and at once the daydreams came swarming up. Jack was in charge of the hunt and there would be time to get to the mountain -- Once, following his father from Chatham to Devonport, they had lived in a cottage on the edge of the moors. In the succession of houses that Ralph had known, this one stood out with particular clarity because after that house he had been sent away to school. Mummy had still been with them and Daddy had come home every day. Wild ponies came to the stone wall at the bottom of the garden, and it had snowed. Just behind the cottage there was a sort of shed and you could lie up there, watching the flakes swirl past. You could see the damp spot where each flake died, then you could mark the first flake that lay down without melting and watch, the whole ground turn white. You could go indoors when you were cold and look out of the window, past the bright copper kettle and the plate with the little blue men.</div>

<div class="line_en">When you went to bed there was a bowl of cornflakes with sugar and cream. And the books -- they stood on the shelf by the bed, leaning together with always two or three laid flat on top because he had not bothered to put them back properly. They were dog-eared and scratched. There was the bright, shining one about Topsy and Mopsy that he never read because it was about two girls; there was the one about the magician which you read with a kind of tied-down terror, skipping page twenty-seven with the awful picture of the spider; there was a book about people who had dug things up, Egyptian things; there was The Boy's Book of Trains, The Boy's Book of Ships. Vividly they came before him; he could have reached up and touched them, could feel the weight and slow slide with which The Mammoth Book for Boys would come out and slither down… Everything was all right; everything was good-humored and friendly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每当去睡觉前总会有一碗带糖和奶油的玉米片。还有不少书——竖在床旁的书架上，书斜靠在一起，可总有两三本平放在书顶上，因为他懒得把书放回原处。这几本书折着边角，上面乱涂乱画。有一本色彩鲜明，闪闪发亮，是关于托普茜和莫普茜的书，可他从未看过，因为那本书讲的是两个小姑娘；有一本说的是妖道术士，看起来心惊肉跳，跳翻到二十七页上有一幅狰狞可怕的蜘蛛图；还有本书谈的是发掘旧东西的人，发掘埃及的玩意儿；还有儿童读物《火车》和《轮船》。这些书都栩栩如生地跑到了拉尔夫面前；他似乎一伸手就够得着摸得到，似乎感觉到了那厚厚的少年百科全书挤出来滑下去时的分量和慢慢的移动。……一切都很好；一切都是愉快而亲切的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The bushes crashed ahead of them. Boys flung themselves wildly from the pig track and scrabbled in the creepers, screaming. Ralph saw Jack nudged aside and fall. Then there was a creature bounding along the pig track toward him, with tusks gleaming and an intimidating grunt. Ralph found he was able to measure the distance coldly and take aim. With the boar only five yards away, he flung the foolish wooden stick that he carried, saw it hit the great snout and hang there for a moment. The boar's note changed to a squeal and it swerved aside into the covert. The pig-run filled with shouting boys again, Jack came running back, and poked about in the undergrowth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="队伍正前方的矮灌木丛哗啦一声被撞开了。孩子们发狂地从野猪小道上逃开来，他们在藤蔓中爬呀叫呀。拉尔夫看见杰克被别人的手肘推到一边，并倒在地上。随即有一个东西沿着野猪的小道径直朝他跳着冲来，它獠牙闪闪，发出恫吓的哼哼声。拉尔夫感到自己能冷静地算出距离瞄准目标。野公猪到了只有五码开外，拉尔夫把手中那根笨拙的尖木棒掷过去，看着尖木棒打中了野猪的大鼻子，还在那上面挂了片刻。野公猪的叫声变了，开始尖声地急叫起来，它猛地朝旁边折进了浓密的树丛。野猪出没的小道上又挤满了尖声叫喊的孩子们，杰克奔了回来，拨弄着矮树丛。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Once more Ralph dreamed, letting his skillful feet deal with the difficulties of the path. Yet here his feet seemed less skillful than before. For most of the way they were forced right down to the bare rock by the water and had to edge along between that and the dark luxuriance of the forest. There were little cliffs to be scaled, some to be used as paths, lengthy traverses where one used hands as well as feet. Here and there they could clamber over wave-wet rock, leaping across clear pools that the tide had left. They came to a gully that split the narrow foreshore like a defense. This seemed to have no bottom and they peered awe-stricken into the gloomy crack where water gurgled. Then the wave came back, the gully boiled before them and spray dashed up to the very creeper so that the boys were wet and shrieking. They tried the forest but it was thick and woven like a bird's nest. In the end they had to jump one by one, waiting till the water sank; and even so, some of them got a second drenching. After that the rocks seemed to be growing impassable so they sat for a time, letting their rags dry and watching the clipped outlines of the rollers that moved so slowly past the island. They found fruit in a haunt of bright little birds that hovered like insects. Then Ralph said they were going too slowly. He himself climbed a tree and parted the canopy, and saw the square head of the mountain seeming still a great way off. Then they tried to hurry along the rocks and Robert cut his knee quite badly and they had to recognize that this path must be taken slowly if they were to be safe. So they proceeded after that as if they were climbing a dangerous mountain, until the rocks became an uncompromising cliff, overhung with impossible jungle and falling sheer into the sea.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拉尔夫再一次做起白日梦来，他脚步灵巧地避开小路上的障碍。然而到这儿，他的脚步似乎没有以前那样灵巧。因为大部分的路程孩子们被迫直下到海边的光岩石处，他们不得不在岩石边和林木茂盛的黑的森林之间侧身慢走。一座座小陡壁需要攀登，有的简直就当作是前进的道路，在长长的之字形攀爬中，任何人都得手脚并用才行。他们到处都要爬过被海浪打湿的岩石，跳过海水退后留下的清澈的小水潭。孩子们碰上了一道把狭窄的岸坡隔开，防御工事似的海沟。海沟仿佛是没有底的，他们畏惧地俯看着海水汩汩的黑洞洞的裂缝。随即海浪又冲了回来，在他们面前，海沟里的海水翻腾着，浪花四溅，正好溅到藤蔓里，孩子们身上弄湿了，口中尖声叫唤。他们尝试着穿越森林，可森林密密层层，交织缠绕得就像鸟窝似的。末了他们只得等海水退时一个接一个跳过去；即使这样，有些孩子还是又一次淋得湿透。之后的山岩仿佛越来越难以通过，因此他们只好暂时坐下歇一会儿，好让一身破衣烂衫干一干，他们注视着慢慢地越过海岛的一排排轮廓清晰的巨浪。一群欢快的小鸟像昆虫似的飞来飞去，在小鸟出入的地方，他们又找到了野果。拉尔夫说他们走得太慢了。他自己爬上了一棵大树，拨开枝叶茂盛的树冠，看到四四方方的山头似乎还是老远的。然后他们就沿着山岩急匆匆地赶起路来，不料罗伯特的膝盖却被割伤了，伤得不轻，大家这才认识到，如果要想不出事，这条小路就必须慢慢地爬。此后他们就像是在爬一座险峻的山岭那样往前挪着，直爬到山岩形成了一道无法攀登的悬崖绝壁，突出在绝壁之上的是难以对付的丛林，整块山岩则直落到大海之中。">查看中文翻译</div>
