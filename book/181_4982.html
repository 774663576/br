<div class="line_en">Now we must get back to Edmund. When he had been made to walk far further than he had ever known that anybody could walk, the Witch at last halted in a dark valley all overshadowed with fir trees and yew trees. Edmund simply sank down and lay on his face doing nothing at all and not even caring what was going to happen next provided they would let him lie still. He was too tired even to notice how hungry and thirsty he was. The Witch and the dwarf were talking close beside him in low tones.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在我们得回头交代爱德蒙的事了。他被迫走啊走的，走了老远老远，就他所知，谁也走不了比这更远的路，妖婆这才终于在一个覆盖着冷杉和紫杉的暗谷里停了下来。爱德蒙什么也不干，只是扑倒在地上，如果他们就让他一动不动地躺着，他连下面会出什么事都不在乎。他太累了，连自己多饿多渴也顾不上了。妖婆和小矮人就在他身边低声说着话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Edmund found himself being roughly forced to his feet. Then the dwarf set him with his back against a tree and bound him fast. He saw the Witch take off her outer mantle. Her arms were bare underneath it and terribly white. Because they were so very white he could see them, but he could not see much else, it was so dark in this valley under the dark trees.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱德蒙只觉得自己被粗暴地拉了起来。接着小矮人让他背靠着一棵树，把他紧紧绑上。他看见妖婆脱下了外面的披风，露出里面两条光胳膊，白得吓人。因为胳膊那么白，在漆黑的树下，这个山谷里又那么黑，他没法看见另外的东西。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At that very moment he heard loud shouts from every direction -- a drumming of hoofs and a beating of wings -- a scream from the Witch -- confusion all round him.

<div class="line_en">"Prepare the victim,", said the Witch. And the dwarf undid Edmund's collar and folded back his shirt at the neck. Then he took Edmund's hair and pulled his head back so that he had to raise his chin. After that Edmund heard a strange noise -- whizz whizz -- whizz. For a moment he couldn't think what it was. Then he realized. It was the sound of a knife being sharpened.</div>

<div class="line_en">Presently the centaurs and unicorns and deer and birds (they were of course the rescue party which Aslan had sent in the last chapter) all set off to go back to the Stone Table, carrying Edmund with them.

<div class="line_en">It was perfectly still and presently the moon grew bright; if you had been there you would have seen the moonlight shining on an old tree-stump and on a fairsized boulder. But if you had gone on looking you would gradually have begun to think there was something odd about both the stump and the boulder. And next you would have thought that the stump did look really remarkably like a little fat man crouching on the ground. And if you had watched long enough you would have seen the stump walk across to the boulder and the boulder sit up and begin talking to the stump; for in reality the stump and the boulder were simply the Witch and the dwarf. For it was part of her magic that she could make things look like what they aren't, and she had the presence of mind to do so at the very moment when the knife was knocked out of her hand. She had kept hold of her wand, so it had been kept safe, too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山谷里一片寂静，不久月光更明亮了，如果你在场，就会看到月亮照在一截老树桩和一块不大不小的鹅卵石上。但如果你继续观察，就会逐渐想到这树桩和石头有点怪。下一步你会觉得那个树桩其实很像一个小胖子趴在地上。如果你观察的时间够长的话，就会看见那个树桩走到石头身边，石头坐起来，开始跟树桩讲话；因为事实上树桩和石头就是妖婆和小矮人。变形术，这就是妖婆魔法中的一项伎俩，就在她的刀被打下来那一刹那，她就不慌不忙地施出了这一招。她一直是魔杖不离手，因此魔杖也还是好好的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When the other children woke up next morning (they had been sleeping on piles of cushions in the pavilion) the first thing they heard -- from Mrs Beaver -- was that their brother had been rescued and brought into camp late last night; and was at that moment with Aslan. As soon as they had breakfasted4 they all went out, and there they saw Aslan and Edmund walking together in the dewy grass, apart from the rest of the court. There is no need to tell you (and no one ever heard) what Aslan was saying, but it was a conversation which Edmund never forgot. As the others drew nearer Aslan turned to meet them, bringing Edmund with him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天早上，另外那三个孩子醒来以后（他们就睡在帐篷里一堆堆垫子上），首先就听到海狸太太对他们说：他们的兄弟已经得救，昨天深夜已经带回营地，这会儿正在阿斯兰那儿。他们刚吃完早饭就一起上外面去，只见阿斯兰和爱德蒙撇开在场的其他人，在挂满露珠的草地上一起散步。不用告诉你阿斯兰说了些什么（也没人听说过），不过这次谈话是爱德蒙终身难忘的。三个孩子走近时，阿斯兰带着爱德蒙一起转身来见他们。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Edmund shook hands with each of the others and said to each of them in turn, "I'm sorry," and everyone said, "That's all right." And then everyone wanted very hard to say something which would make it quite clear that they were all friends with him again -- something ordinary and natural -- and of course no one could think of anything in the world to say. But before they had time to feel really awkward one of the leopards approached Aslan and said,</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱德蒙跟大家一一握手，挨个儿说了“对不起”，大家都说了声“没关系”。随后，大家都想说点什么能表明他们大家跟他重新友好的话——说点寻常而自然的话——当然谁也想不出说什么才好。不过他们还没来得及感到尴尬，一头豹就来到阿斯兰跟前说：">查看中文翻译</div>

"But supposing she turns the two leopards into stone?" whispered Lucy to Peter.

<div class="line_en">A few minutes later the Witch herself walked out on to the top of the hill and came straight across and stood before Aslan. The three children who had not seen her before felt shudders running down their backs at the sight of her face; and there were low growls among all the animals present. Though it was bright sunshine everyone felt suddenly cold. The only two people present who seemed to be quite at their ease were Aslan and the Witch herself. It was the oddest thing to see those two faces -- the golden face and the dead-white face so close together. Not that the Witch looked Aslan exactly in his eyes; Mrs Beaver particularly noticed this.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几分钟以后，妖婆本人走上小山顶，一直走过去，站在阿斯兰面前。三个孩子以前都没见过她，一看她那张脸就觉得背上一阵发毛；在场的所有动物也都低声咆哮。虽然这时阳光明媚，可每个人都突然感到一阵寒意。现场只有阿斯兰和妖婆两个看来仍然从容自若。看见一张金黄色的脸和一张惨白的脸，两张脸凑得这么近，真是件天大的怪事。怪的倒不是妖婆竟然正视阿斯兰的眼睛，海狸太太特别留心到这一点。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Work against the Emperor's Magic?" said Aslan, turning to her with something like a frown on his face. And nobody ever made that suggestion to him again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对付皇帝的魔法？”阿斯兰说着脸上露出不大高兴的样子。于是再也没人向它提出那种建议了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They all obeyed. It was a terrible time this -- waiting and wondering while the Lion and the Witch talked earnestly together in low voices. Lucy said, "Oh, Edmund!" and began to cry. Peter stood with his back to the others looking out at the distant sea. The Beavers stood holding each other's paws with their heads bowed. The centaurs stamped uneasily with their hoofs. But everyone became perfectly still in the end, so that you noticed even small sounds like a bumble-bee flying past, or the birds in the forest down below them, or the wind rustling the leaves. And still the talk between Aslan and the White Witch went on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大家全都遵命。这段时间可真难熬——当狮王和妖婆低声诚恳会谈时，大家就等啊等的，满心疑虑。露茜说了声 “哦，爱德蒙”就哭了起来。彼得背对着大家，看着远处的大海。海狸夫妇相互拉着爪子，低头站着。人头马不安地直跺脚。不过大家最后都寂静无声，静得连野蜂飞过的细微声音，或是山下林子里小鸟的动静，或是风吹树叶沙沙响的声音都能听见。阿斯兰和白妖婆仍在继续会谈。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Fall back, all of you," said Aslan, "and I will talk to the Witch alone."</div>

<div class="line_en">The Witch was just turning away with a look of fierce joy on her face when she stopped and said, "But how do I know this promise will be kept?"</div>

<div class="line_en">At last they heard Aslan's voice, "You can all come back," he said. "I have settled the matter. She has renounced the claim on your brother's blood." And all over the hill there was a noise as if everyone had been holding their breath and had now begun breathing again, and then a murmur of talk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后他们听见了阿斯兰的声音。“你们大家可以回来了，”他说，“我把这事解决了。她放弃了要你们兄弟的血的权利。”这时整个山头都有了声音，仿佛大家刚才一直屏息以待，现在才又开始呼吸了；随后就是一阵喃喃的说话声。他们都开始回到阿斯兰的宝座边来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Haa-a-arrh!" roared Aslan, half rising from his throne; and his great mouth opened wider and wider and the roar grew louder and louder, and the Witch, after staring for a moment with her lips wide apart, picked up her skirts and fairly ran for her life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊呜！”阿斯兰半身离开宝座怒吼起来，只见它那张大嘴越来越大，吼声也越来越响，而妖婆呢，也张大了嘴巴，盯着狮王看了一会儿以后，就拉起裙子，老老实实逃命去了。">查看中文翻译</div>
