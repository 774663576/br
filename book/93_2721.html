<div class="line_en">For my in-laws, to love is to worry. When John's parents visited us from New York, his mother would get me alone and inquire delicately. After a perfect summer seafood dinner at their beach house, the same questions were fired at us. They always made attempts to know our attitude. Didn't we want kids? Or was there a problem with our marriage?</div>

<div class="line_en">By the year my husband turned 40 and I hit the age of 35, John's parents evidently were worried about us. His older brother had produced three grandchildren. So had his younger sister. We had produced none.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到我丈夫40岁、我35岁的那年，约翰的父母显然很担心我们。他的哥哥已经生了三个孙子。他的妹妹也是如此。我们什么也没生产出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">By then we were wondering too. In earlier years the pressure to procreate had made us roll our eyes. In our 20's and even into our 30's, we were ambivalent about the whole idea of children. We certainly didn't regard the decision as anyone's business but our own. Besides, what was the big deal? His parents already had six grandchildren. Why did they need more from us?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那时我们也在想。在早些年，生育的压力使我们翻白眼。在我们20多岁甚至30多岁的时候，我们对孩子的整个概念都是矛盾的。我们当然不认为这个决定是任何人的事，而是我们自己的事。此外，这有什么大不了的？他的父母已经有了六个孙子。为什么他们需要从我们这里得到更多？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">John's father rarely said anything, yet I knew that she spoke for both of them. He was a retired ambassador and he liked to call himself a cranky old mail. But I knew that he cared and they fretted over us together.</div>

<div class="line_en">Yet to hope does not always mean receiving. By the time I was 35, John and I had been"trying"for three years, however, I did not get pregnant. It seemed that Mother Nature was displeased. Our sex life became a lab experiment, and our emotional life wavered monthly between hidden optimism and ruined expectations. Then finally, one day in January. The pregnancy test turned pink. John and I stared repeatedly at the supernatural stick in excitement and could not firmly believe. Was this true? Should we tell everyone?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，希望并不总是意味着接受。在我35岁的时候，约翰和我已经“尝试”了三年，但是，我没有怀孕。似乎大自然母亲很不高兴。我们的性生活变成了一个实验室实验，我们的情感生活每个月都在隐藏的乐观和破灭的期望之间摇摆。最后，在一月的一天。验孕试纸变成了粉红色。约翰和我兴奋地反复盯着那根超自然的棍子，不能坚定地相信。这是真的吗？我们应该告诉所有人吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We decided to tell his parents on February 15, the day John's father would turn 70. We were planning to surprise him by going up a few days early and to join the family for a birthday dinner at an elegant New York City restaurant. By then I would be six weeks pregnant. What an idea it would be to give him the ultimate gift -- the news that, at long last, we would add a baby to the family.</div>

<div class="line_en">As a baby became central to our hopes, I better understood my in-laws' interference.

<div class="line_en">We watched the news late into the night, huddled beside the fireplace as the snow continued to fall. Drinking hot tea and hot alcohol, we debated whether to drive out the next day. Finally, we acceded to the decision that the event meant too much not to gamble on it. My brother-in-law, a can-do man who inspires absolute confidence, was cautious but willing to take the wheel.</div>

<div class="line_en">We flew into Baltimore, planning to drive to New York the next day with John's sister and her family. But nature was not cooperative. That was the winter of 1960, the year that broke records of snowfall on the East Coast. A typhoon blew up then. And the weather forecasts issued stern warnings not to drive the next day.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们飞到巴尔的摩，计划第二天和约翰的姐姐及其家人一起开车去纽约。但是大自然并不合作。那是1960年的冬天，那一年打破了东海岸的降雪记录。当时刮起了台风。天气预报严厉警告第二天不要开车。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When we finally arrived t hat night, the landscape of the outskirts of New York had been transformed into a Nordic paradise. John's father still had no idea we were coming. Wrapped in a huge thermal coat. John knocked on the front door. "How hard it is snowing!"He said to his dad. When his puzzled father finally recognized him and ascertained what really happened, he sank back into a chair. How had we appeared from Texas in the midst of a bleak snowstorm so fierce that airports had canceled flights? All of us thought that to make the old man stunned and pleased was worth the freezing on the long journey.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当我们终于在那天晚上到达时，纽约郊外的景色已经变成了北欧人的天堂。约翰的父亲仍然不知道我们要来。包裹在一件巨大的保暖外套里。约翰敲了敲前门。“雪下得真大！”他对他爸爸说。当他困惑的父亲终于认出他并弄清楚到底发生了什么事时，他又坐回到椅子上。我们是如何从德克萨斯州出现在一场如此猛烈的阴冷暴风雪中，以至于机场取消了航班？我们大家都认为，为了让老人感到震惊和高兴，值得在长途旅行中受冻。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That night the eight adults went out for a formal makeup birthday banquet at a restaurant. The atmosphere was strange and bittersweet. A 70th birthday celebration innately has a dark note; to make a fuss of it is to acknowledge that the life is finite. Death may come at any hour. Aching with cramps and grief, I had wanted to stay home in bed. The sufferings spoiled my appetite. But John and his family had insisted on my joining them, and they were right. Our communal dinner honored our father's long life. We were family; sharing great meals was our glue and our comfort. We all drowned our complicated emotions in the toasts to my father-in-law.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天晚上，八个大人去一家餐馆参加一个正式的化妆生日宴会。那里的气氛奇怪而又苦乐参半。一个70岁的生日庆祝活动有一个阴暗的音符；对它小题大做就是承认生命是有限的。死亡随时可能降临。由于抽筋和悲伤，我一直想待在家里的床上。痛苦使我食欲大减。但是约翰和他的家人坚持要我加入他们，他们是对的。我们的公共晚餐是为了纪念父亲的长寿。我们是一家人，分享美味佳肴是我们的粘合剂和慰藉。我们都把复杂的情绪淹没在对岳父的祝酒中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We didn't make it into the city for our elegant dinner: the roads and bridges were Virtually in accessible. We ended up eating at a neighborhood Chinese restaurant. Excited by our successful adventure, we made a noisy, festive party around the big family table. John and I exchanged a glance -- now? Then I respectfully presented his father with a gift-wrapped box. He opened it, stared bewildered at our gift, a baby doll in a fabric fashioned from a Texas flag. He held up the doll and kept saying"Oh my Cod!"with watering blue eyes. It traveled around the table, everyone congratulated us.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们进城并不是为了享用优雅的晚餐：道路和桥梁几乎是可以到达的。最后我们在附近的一家中餐馆吃饭。我们为这次成功的冒险感到兴奋，围着家里的大桌子举行了一个热闹、欢乐的派对。约翰和我交换了一下眼神——现在？然后，我恭敬地送给他父亲一个礼品包装盒。他打开礼物，目瞪口呆地看着我们的礼物，一个用德克萨斯州旗帜做成的布料制成的娃娃。他举起洋娃娃，不停地说：“哦，我的上帝！”流着泪的蓝眼睛。它绕着桌子走，每个人都祝贺我们。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The next morning, I started to bleed and to feel pain. Then to bleed more. Both my sisters-in-law had suffered troublesome pregnancies. Late that afternoon they sat with me and John in his boyhood bedroom as we struggled to face the matter. I found a spiritual comfort from their concern and anxiety. A call to my doctor confirmed the terrible truth: I had probably had an abortion.</div>

<div class="line_en">Back home. John and I were struck down by the power of our grief. Neither of us could drag ourselves to work. We felt like a couple of baggage in a locker.

<div class="line_en">But once again, nature surprised us. Two months later, almost by accident, I turned up pregnant -- a miracle! This time, we superstitiously kept the news to ourselves for a full three months. During those long days, we barely even allowed ourselves to believe in the pregnancy.

The many obstacles that John and I had Overcome made US go into raptures over the birth of the little being. Among our most joyous phone calls was the one to his parents. We did it! She's here!

I hadn't seen snow myself since that East Coast storm two years before. Then it had been accompanied by an emotional blizzard.
