<div class="line_en">The boy from District 1 dies before he can pull out the spear. My arrow drives deeply into the center of his neck. He falls to his knees and halves the brief remainder of his life by yanking out the arrow and drowning in his own blood. I'm reloaded, shifting my aim from side to side, while I shout at Rue, "Are there more? Are there more?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Rue has rolled to her side, her body curved in and around the spear. I shove the boy away from her and pull out my knife, freeing her from the net. One look at the wound and I know it's far beyond my capacity to heal. Beyond anyone's probably. The spearhead is buried up to the shaft in her stomach. I crouch before her, staring helplessly at the embedded weapon. There's no point in comforting words, in telling her she'll be all right. She's no fool. Her hand reaches out and I clutch it like a lifeline. As if it's me who's dying instead of Rue.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="露露侧身缩成一团躺在地上，那支矛正好扎在她弯曲的身体里，我把男孩的尸体推开，拔出刀把网割断。一看伤口就知道她的伤根本不是我能治好的，也许无人能行。矛尖和矛杆已经深深扎入她的腹中。我蹲在她面前，眼睁睁地看着扎到她身体里的武器而束手无策。此时告诉她没事、说些宽慰的话已没有意义，她心里都明白。她伸出手，我紧紧地握住，就像要攫住她的生命。我感觉正在死去的是我而不是露露。">查看中文翻译</div>

The song that comes to me is a simple lullaby, one we sing fretful, hungry babies to sleep with. It's old, very old I think. Made up long ago in our hills. What my music teacher calls a mountain air. But the words are easy and soothing, promising tomorrow will be more hopeful than this awful piece of time we call today.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="唱歌吧，可我喉咙发紧，烟熏和疲惫使之沙哑了。可如果是波丽姆要我唱歌的话呢？我是说，这毕竟也是露露最后的请求，我至少应该试试。我唱了一个朴素的摇篮曲，哄挨饿吵闹的孩子入睡的小曲。它似乎来自冰冷遥远的世界，很久很久以前飘荡在我们的山野里。音乐老师说这首歌是山村风格，歌词朴素简单，告诉人们明天比痛苦的今天更美好。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sing? I think. Sing what? I do know a few songs. Believe it or not, there was once music in my house, too. Music I helped make. My father pulled me in with that remarkable voice -- but I haven't sung much since he died. Except when Prim is very sick. Then I sing her the same songs she liked as a baby.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“唱歌？”我想，“唱什么？”我确实会一两首歌，信不信，以前我的房间也曾有歌声，我帮着爸爸创作的曲调，爸爸曾用他优美的声音带动了我，但自从爸爸死后我很少唱了。除非波丽姆生病时才唱支歌。那我就把这支她还是婴孩时就喜欢的歌唱给露露吧。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I can't stop looking at Rue, smaller than ever, a baby animal curled up in a nest of netting. I can't bring myself to leave her like this. Past harm, but seeming utterly defenseless. To hate the boy from District 1, who also appears so vulnerable in death, seems inadequate. It's the Capitol I hate, for doing this to all of us.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我忍不住又看了眼露露，此时她像幼小的动物般蜷缩在网子里，显得更小了。我不忍就这样离开露露，她受到伤害，看上去是那么的无助。光恨一区的男孩——尽管他死后也很脆弱——还不够，我恨的是凯匹特，恨它对我们所做的一切。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They'll want me to clear out now. So they can collect the bodies. And there's nothing to stay for.

<div class="line_cn" title="他们需要我马上离开，这样他们可以清理尸体。我也无需再留在这里了。我把一区男孩的身体脸朝下翻转过来，拿走他的包，把结果他性命的箭抽出来。我把露露的背包从她背后割下来，知道她也希望我把它拿走，那支矛留在她肚子里没动。">查看中文翻译</div>

There's no way to take revenge on the Capitol. Is there?</div>

<div class="line_en">Then I remember Peeta's words on the roof. "Only I keep wishing I could think of a way to… to show the Capitol they don't own me. That I'm more than just a piece in their Games." And for the first time, I understand what he means.</div>

I gather up an armful and come back to Rue's side. Slowly, one stem at a time, I decorate her body in the flowers. Covering the ugly wound. Wreathing her face. Weaving her hair with bright colors.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在树林里不远处，盛开着一簇野花，花朵是紫色、白色、黄色相间的，我摘了一大捧来到露露身边。我精心地将花朵一朵朵地摆放在她的遗体上，盖上丑陋的伤口，在她的脸庞绕上花环，给她的秀发织出彩色的波浪。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Another mockingjay, a young one by the look of it, lands on a branch before me and bursts out Rue's melody. My song, the hovercraft, were too unfamiliar for this novice to pick up, but it has mastered her handful of notes. The ones that mean she's safe.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一只看上去像雏鸟的嘲笑鸟落在我前面的枝头，鸣唱露露的曲调。我的声音，直升机的声音，对鸟而言太新，没有学会，但它却学会了露露的小调，为露露报平安的小调。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The birds fall silent. Somewhere, a mockingjay gives the warning whistle that precedes the hovercraft. I don't know how it knows. It must hear things that humans can't. I pause, my eyes focused on what's ahead, not what's happening behind me. It doesn't take long, then the general birdsong begins again and I know she's gone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="鸟停止了呜叫，嘲笑鸟在林中发出警报，直升机就要出现。我不知道它们是怎么知道的，它们肯定听到了人类无法捕捉的声音，我停下来，眼睛看着前方，而非身后，鸟儿又开始鸣唱，我知道露露已经被运走了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I'm about to haul my packs into a tree to make camp when a silver parachute floats down and lands in front of me. A gift from a sponsor. But why now?

<div class="line_en">I open the parachute and find a small loaf of bread. It's not the fine white Capitol stuff. It's made of dark ration grain and shaped in a crescent. Sprinkled with seeds. I flashback to Peeta's lesson on the various district breads in the Training Center. This bread came from District 11. I cautiously lift the still warm loaf. What must it have cost the people of District 11 who can't even feed themselves? How many would've had to do without to scrape up a coin to put in the collection for this one loaf? It had been meant for Rue, surely. But instead of pulling the gift when she died, they'd authorized Haymitch to give it to me. As a thank-you? Or because, like me, they don't like to let debts go unpaid? For whatever reason, this is a first. A district gift to a tribute who's not your own.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sometimes when things are particularly bad, my brain will give me a happy dream. A visit with my father in the woods. An hour of sunlight and cake with Prim. Tonight it sends me Rue, still decked in her flowers, perched in a high sea of trees, trying to teach me to talk to the mockingjays. I see no sign of her wounds, no blood, just a bright, laughing girl. She sings songs I've never heard in a clear, melodic voice. On and on. Through the night. There's a drowsy in-between period when I can hear the last few strains of her music although she's lost in the leaves. When I fully awaken, I'm momentarily comforted. I try to hold on to the peaceful feeling of the dream, but it quickly slips away, leaving me sadder and lonelier than ever.</div>

The boy from District 1 has several knives, two spare spearheads, a flashlight, a small leather pouch, a first-aid kit, a full bottle of water, and a pack of dried fruit. A pack of dried fruit! Out of all he might have chosen from. To me, this is a sign of extreme arrogance. Why bother to carry food when you have such a bounty back at camp? When you will kill your enemies so quickly you'll be home before you're hungry? I can only hope the other Careers traveled so lightly when it came to food and now find themselves with nothing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="露露的背包里装着我的睡袋、快空的羊皮袋子、一把干果和植物根、一点兔肉、她的袜子和弹弓。一区男孩的包里有几把刀、两个矛尖、手电、小皮革袋、急救箱、一满瓶水还有一袋干果。在所有供选择的食品里，只选了一袋干果！在我看来，这是极度的傲慢。营地里有那么多食品，所以干吗要带吃的？你很快就结果对手的性命，还没觉得饿就可以返回营地。我希望其他职业选手也没带食品去进行他们轻松的旅行，回来时却发现他们已一无所有。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I know I'm on course when I come across Rue's third, unlit fire. Shortly thereafter, I discover a flock of grooslings perched in the trees and take out three before they know what hit them. I return to Rue's signal fire and start it up, not caring about the excessive smoke. Where are you, Cato? I think as I roast the birds and Rue's roots. I'm waiting right here.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看到露露未点燃的第三堆篝火时，我知道自己走对了。不久我在前面看到一群大嘴雀栖息在树上，三只大嘴雀还迷迷糊糊地，就已命丧箭下。我回到露露堆的柴堆旁，把火点燃，也不管腾起的浓烟。“你在哪里，加图？”我一边烤着大嘴雀和植物根，一边想着。“我在这儿等着你呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I obediently consolidate the supplies I want into my pack. After I climb down the tree, I conceal the boy's knives and spearheads in a pile of rocks so that no one else can use them. I've lost my bearings what with all the wandering around I did yesterday evening, but I try and head back in the general direction of the stream.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我把要用的东西小心地放在背包里。爬到树下，把男孩的刀子和矛尖藏在一堆岩石下面，这样别人就不会用了。昨天无目的乱走已经使我失去方向，但我照着小溪的大致方向走去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Who knows where the Careers are now? Either too far to reach me or too sure this is a trick or… is it possible? Too scared of me? They know I have the bow and arrows, of course, Cato saw me take them from Glimmer's body. But have they put two and two together yet? Figured out I blew up the supplies and killed their fellow Career? Possibly they think Thresh did this. Wouldn't he be more likely to revenge Rue's death than I would? Being from the same district? Not that he ever took any interest in her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="谁知道职业选手在哪儿？他们抑或离得太远赶不到这里，抑或清楚点火是吸引他们的计策…可能吗？太害怕我了？当然，他们知道我有弓箭，加图看到我把弓箭从格丽默的身下抽出来。但他们是不是又两两组合了呢？他们是否已琢磨出我炸毁补给品，之后又杀了他们的同伙？他们很可能认为这是萨里什干的。难道不是他而非我更应为露露报仇吗？原因是他们来自同一区，而非他对她感兴趣。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Speaking of which, my own supply is running low. I finish off the loaf from District 11 and the last of the rabbit. How quickly the food disappears. All I have left are Rue's roots and nuts, the boy's dried fruit, and one strip of beef. Now you have to hunt, Katniss, I tell myself.</div>

<div class="line_en">For the most part, the only communication the tributes get from outside the arena is the nightly death toll. But occasionally, there will be trumpets followed by an announcement. Usually, this will be a call to a feast. When food is scarce, the Gamemakers will invite the players to a banquet, somewhere known to all like the Cornucopia, as an inducement to gather and fight. Sometimes there is a feast and sometimes there's nothing but a loaf of stale bread for the tributes to compete for.
