<div class="line_en">The next day, Hem and Haw returned with tools. Hem held the chisel while Haw banged on the hammer until they made a hole in the wall of Cheese Station C. They peered inside but found no Cheese.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天，哼哼和唧唧带了工具回到奶酪C站。哼哼拿着凿子，唧唧则用锤子敲打。他们费了九牛二虎之力，终于在墙上打出了一个洞，朝里面窥视，却依旧没有发现奶酪的踪迹。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They were disappointed but believed that could solve the problem. So they started earlier, stayed longer, and worked harder. But after a while, all they had was a large hole in the wall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管他们感到非常失望，但他们仍然想念问题会得到解决。以后，他们起得更早，工作得更长、更努力。但是，一段时间以后，他们得到的只是一个个更大的空洞。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Maybe," Hem said, "we should just sit here and see what happens. Sooner or later they have to put the Cheese back."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“也许，”哼哼说：“我们只需要坐在这里，看看到底会发生什么事情。迟早他们会把奶酪再送回来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Their homes were not the nurturing places they once were. The little people had difficulty sleeping and were having nightmares about not finding any Cheese.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们的家，也不再是美好舒适的地方。他们睡不上一个安稳觉，而且每晚的时光伴着找不到奶酪的噩梦度过。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hem said, "You know, if we just work harder we'll find that nothing has really changed that much. The Cheese is probably nearby. Maybe they just hid it behind the wall."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哼哼说：“你知道，如果我们再努力一些，我们也许会发现事情并没有发生太大的变化。奶酪也许就在附近，它们也许只是被人藏到墙后面去了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Haw was beginning to realize the difference between activity and productivity.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="唧唧开始认识到行动和结果的区别。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Haw wanted to believe that. So each day he went home to rest and returned reluctantly with Hem to Cheese Station C. But Cheese never reappeared.</div>

<div class="line_en">By now the little people were growing weak from hunger and stress. Haw was getting tired of just waiting for their situation to improve. He began to see that the longer they stayed in their Cheesless situation, the worse off they would be.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="由于焦虑和饥饿，这两个小矮人已经变得有些虚弱。唧唧已经开始厌倦等待——完全被动地等着状况自己发生好转。他开始明白，他们在奶酪C站等待的时间越长，情况只会变得越糟糕。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Finally, one day Haw began laughing at himself. "Haw, Haw, look at me. I keep doing the same things over and over again and wonder why things don't get better. If this wasn't so ridiculous, it would be even funnier."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="终于，有一天，唧唧开始自己嘲笑起自己来了：“唧唧呀唧唧，看看你自己吧！你居然等到每天重复同样的错误，还总是奇怪、怀疑为什么情况还没有得到改善，还有什么比你这种做法更可笑的呢？这如果不是荒谬，就是滑稽。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He asked Hem, "Where did we put out jogging suits and running shoes?" It took a long time to find them because they had put everything away when they found their Cheese at Cheese Station C, thinking they wouldn't be needing them anymore.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他问哼哼：“我们的运动衣和慢跑鞋放到哪里去了？”他花了很长的时间才翻出了那些运动装备。当初，他们在奶酪C站找到奶酪以后，就把鞋啊什么的都有扔到一边去了，因为他们满以为再也不会需要这些玩意儿了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Haw knew they were loosing their edge.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="唧唧明白，他们正在失去自己的优势。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Haw did not like the idea of having to run through the maze again, because he knew he would get lost and have no idea where he would find any Cheese. But he had to laugh at his folly when he saw what his fear was doing to him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="唧唧并不想再到迷宫中去奔波。他知道他可能会迷路，而且他也不知道究竟应该到哪儿去寻找新的奶酪。但当他明白正是他的恐惧感使他如此裹足不前、坐以待毙的时候，他嘲笑起自己的愚笨。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As Hem saw his friend getting into his running gear, he said, "You're not really going out into the maze again, are you? Why don't you just wait here with me until they put the Cheese back?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当哼哼看到他的朋友穿上运动服时，他说，“你不是真的要到迷宫中去吧？你为什么不留下来，和我一起在这里等，等着他们把奶酪送回来？“">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Because, you just don't get it," Haw said. "I didn't want to see it either, but now I realized they're never going to put the Old Cheese back. That was yesterday's Cheese. It's time to find New Cheese.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“因为如果这么做，我们将永远不会得到那些奶酪，”唧唧大声说：“不会有人把奶酪送回来了，现在已经到了去寻找新奶酪的时候了，不要再想那些早已不存在的奶酪了！”">查看中文翻译</div>
