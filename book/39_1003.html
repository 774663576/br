<div class="line_en">Here is what I do on the first day of snowfall every year: I step out of the house early in the morning, still in my pajamas, hugging my arms against the chill. I find the driveway, my father's car, the walls, the trees, the rooftops, and the hills buried under a foot of snow. I smile. The sky is seamless and blue, the snow so white my eyes burn. I shovel a handful of the fresh snow into my mouth, listen to the muffled stillness broken only by the cawing of crows. I walk down the front steps, barefoot, and call for Hassan to come out and see.</div>

<div class="line_en">Winter was every kid's favorite season in Kabul, at least those whose fathers could afford to buy a good iron stove. The reason was simple: They shut down school for the icy season. Winter to me was the end of long division and naming the capital of Bulgaria, and the start of three months of playing cards by the stove with Hassan, free Russian movies on Tuesday mornings at Cinema Park, sweet turnip "qurma" over rice for lunch after a morning of building snowmen.</div>

<div class="line_en">For a few unfortunate kids, winter did not spell the end of the school year. There were the so-called voluntary winter courses. No kid I knew ever volunteered to go to these classes; parents, of course, did the volunteering for them. Fortunately for me, Baba was not one of them. I remember one kid, Ahmad, who lived across the street from us. His father was some kind of doctor, I think. Ahmad had epilepsy and always wore a wool vest and thick blackrimmed glasses -- he was one of Assef's regular victims. Every morning, I watched from my bedroom window as their Hazara servant shoveled snow from the driveway, cleared the way for the black Opel. I made a point of watching Ahmad and his father get into the car, Ahmad in his wool vest and winter coat, his schoolbag filled with books and pencils. I waited until they pulled away, turned the corner, then I slipped back into bed in my flannel pajamas. I pulled the blanket to my chin and watched the snowcapped hills in the north through the window. Watched them until I drifted back to sleep.</div>

<div class="line_en">I loved wintertime in Kabul. I loved it for the soft pattering of snow against my window at night, for the way fresh snow crunched under my black rubber boots, for the warmth of the cast-iron stove as the wind screeched through the yards, the streets. But mostly because, as the trees froze and ice sheathed the roads, the chill between Baba and me thawed a little. And the reason for that was the kites. Baba and I lived in the same house, but in different spheres of existence. Kites were the one paper thin slice of intersection between those spheres.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我喜欢喀布尔的冬天。我喜欢夜里满天飞雪轻轻敲打我的窗户，我喜欢新霁的积雪在我的黑色胶靴下吱嘎作响，我喜欢感受铁炉的温暖，听寒风呼啸着吹过街道、吹过院子。但更重要的是，每逢林木萧瑟，冰雪封路，爸爸和我之间的寒意会稍微好转。那是因为风筝。爸爸和我生活在同一个屋顶之下，但我们生活在各自的区域，风筝是我们之间薄如纸的交集。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">EVERY WINTER, districts in Kabul held a kite-fighting tournament. And if you were a boy living in Kabul, the day of the tournament was undeniably the highlight of the cold season. I never slept the night before the tournament. I'd roll from side to side, make shadow animals on the wall, even sit on the balcony in the dark, a blanket wrapped around me. I felt like a soldier trying to sleep in the trenches the night before a major battle. And that wasn't so far off. In Kabul, fighting kites was a little like going to war.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每年冬天，喀布尔的各个城区会举办风筝比赛。如果你是生活在喀布尔的孩子，那么比赛那天，无疑是这个寒冷季节最令人振奋的时候。每次比赛前夜我都会失眠，我会辗转反侧，双手借着灯光在墙上投射出动物形状的影子，甚至裹条毛毯，在一片漆黑中到阳台上呆坐。我像是个士兵，大战来临前夜试图在战壕上入睡。其实也差不多，在喀布尔，斗风筝跟上战场有点相像。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As with any war, you had to ready yourself for battle. For a while, Hassan and I used to build our own kites. We saved our weekly allowances in the fall, dropped the money in a little porcelain horse Raba had brought one time from Herat. When the winds of winter began to blow and snow fell in chunks, we undid the snap under the horse's belly. We went to the bazaar and bought bamboo, glue, string, and paper. We spent hours every day shaving bamboo for the center and cross spars, cutting the thin tissue paper which made for easy dipping and recovery And then, of course, we had to make our own string, or tar. If the kite was the gun, then "tar", the glass-coated cutting line, was the bullet in the chamber. We'd go out in the yard and feed up to five hundred feet of string through a mixture of ground glass and glue. We'd then hang the line between the trees, leave it to dry. The next day, we'd wind the battle-ready line around a wooden spool. By the time the snow melted and the rains of spring swept in, every boy in Kabul bore telltale horizontal gashes on his fingers from a whole winter of fighting kites. I remember how my classmates and I used to huddle, compare our battle scars on the first day of school. The cuts stung and didn't heal for a couple of weeks, but I didn't mind. They were reminders of a beloved season that had once again passed too quickly. Then the class captain would blow his whistle and we'd march in a single file to our classrooms, longing for winter already, greeted instead by the specter of yet another long school year.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="跟任何战争一样，你必须为自己做好准备。有那么一阵，哈桑和我经常自己制作风筝。秋天开始，我们每周省下一点零用钱，投进爸爸从赫拉特买来的瓷马里面。到得寒风呼啸、雪花飞舞的时候，我们揭开瓷马腹部的盖子，到市场去买竹子、胶水、线、纸。我们每天花几个小时，打造风筝的骨架，剪裁那些让风筝更加灵动的薄棉纸。再接着，我们当然还得自己准备线。如果风筝是枪，那么缀有玻璃屑的线就是膛里的子弹。我们得走到院子里，把五百英尺线放进一桶混有玻璃屑的胶水里面，接着把线挂在树上，让它风干。第二天，我们会把这为战斗准备的线缠绕在一个木轴上。等到雪花融化、春雨绵绵，喀布尔每个孩子的手指上，都会有一些横切的伤口，那是斗了一个冬天的风筝留下的证据。我记得开学那天，同学们挤在一起，比较各自的战伤。伤口很痛，几个星期都好不了，但我毫不在意。我们的冬天总是那样匆匆来了又走，伤疤提醒我们怀念那个最令人喜爱的季节。接着班长会吹口哨，我们排成一列，走进教室，心中已然渴望冬季的到来，但招呼我们的是又一个幽灵般的漫长学年。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But it quickly became apparent that Hassan and I were better kite fighters than kite makers. Some flaw or other in our design always spelled its doom. So Baba started taking us to Saifo's to buy our kites. Saifo was a nearly blind old man who was a "moochi" by profession -- a shoe repairman. But he was also the city's most famous kite maker, working out of a tiny hovel on Jadeh Maywand, the crowded street south of the muddy banks of the Kabul River. I remember you had to crouch to enter the prison cell-sized store, and then had to lift a trapdoor to creep down a set of wooden steps to the dank basement where Saifo stored his coveted kites. Baba would buy us each three identical kites and spools of glass string. If I changed my mind and asked for a bigger and fancier kite, Baba would buy it for me -- but then he'd buy it for Hassan too. Sometimes I wished he wouldn't do that. Wished he'd let me be the favorite.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是没隔多久，事实证明我和哈桑造风筝实在不行，斗风筝倒是好手。我们设计的风筝总是有这样或那样的问题，难逃悲惨的命运。所以爸爸开始带我们去塞弗的店里买风筝。塞弗是个近乎瞎眼的老人，以替人修鞋为生，但他也是全城最著名的造风筝高手。他的小作坊在拥挤的雅德梅湾大道上，也就是喀布尔河泥泞的南岸那边。我记得你必须蹲下来才能进入像监狱牢房大小的商店，然后必须掀开一扇活板门才能从一组木制台阶爬下去到潮湿的地下室，塞弗把他梦寐以求的风筝放在那里。爸爸会给我们每人买三个同样的风筝和几轴玻璃线。如果我改变主意，求爸爸给我买个更大、更好看的风筝，爸爸会买给我，可是也会给哈桑买一个。有时我希望他别给哈桑买，希望他最疼我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The kite-fighting tournament was an old winter tradition in Afghanistan. It started early in the morning on the day of the contest and didn't end until only the winning kite flew in the sky -- I remember one year the tournament outlasted daylight. People gathered on sidewalks and roofs to cheer for their kids. The streets filled with kite fighters, jerking and tugging on their lines, squinting up to the sky, trying to gain position to cut the opponent's line. Every kite fighter had an assistant -- in my case, Hassan -- who held the spool and fed the line.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斗风筝比赛是阿富汗古老的冬日风俗。比赛一大清早就开始，直到仅剩一只胜出的风筝在空中翱翔才告结束。我记得有一年，比赛到了天黑还没终结。人们在人行道上，在屋顶上，为自家的孩子鼓劲加油。街道上满是风筝斗士，手里的线时而猛拉、时而速放，目不转睛地仰望天空，力图占个好位置，以便割断敌手的风筝线。每个斗风筝的人都有助手，帮忙收放风筝线。我的助手是哈桑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One time, a bratty Hindi kid whose family had recently moved into the neighborhood told us that in his Hometown, kite fighting had strict rules and regulations. "You have to play in a boxed area and you have to stand at a right angle to the wind," he said proudly. "And you can't use aluminum to make your glass string."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一次，有个多嘴的印度小孩，他家最近才搬到附近，告诉我们，在他的家乡，斗风筝必须严格遵守一些规则和规定。“你必须在指定的区域放风筝，并且你必须站在风向成直角的地方。”他骄傲地说，“还有，你不能用铝来做玻璃线。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hassan and I looked at each other. Cracked up. The Hindi kid would soon learn what the British learned earlier in the century, and what the Russians would eventually learn by the late 1980s: that Afghans are an independent people. Afghans cherish custom but abhor rules. And so it was with kite fighting. The rules were simple: No rules. Fly your kite. Cut the opponents. Good luck.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈桑和我对望了一眼。让你吹吧。这个印度小孩很快会学到的，跟英国人在这个世纪之初以及俄国人在1980年代晚期学到的如出一辙：阿富汗人是独立的民族。阿富汗人尊重风俗，但讨厌规则，斗风筝也是这样。规则很简单：放起你的风筝，割断对手的线，祝你好运。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Except that wasn't all. The real fun began when a kite was cut. That was where the kite runners came in, those kids who chased the windblown kite drifting through the neighborhoods until it came spiraling down in a field, dropping in someone's yard, on a tree, or a rooftop. The chase got pretty fierce; hordes of kite runners swarmed the streets, shoved past each other like those people from Spain I'd read about once, the ones who ran from the bulls. One year a neighborhood kid climbed a pine tree for a kite. A branch snapped under his weight and he fell thirty feet. Broke his back and never walked again. But he fell with the kite still in his hands. And when a kite runner had his hands on a kite, no one could take it from him. That wasn't a rule. That was custom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不仅如此，若有风筝被割断，真正的乐趣就开始了。这时，该追风筝的人出动，那些孩子追逐那个在随风飘扬的风筝，在临近的街区奔走，直到它盘旋着跌落在田里，或者掉进某家的院子里，或挂在树上，或停在屋顶上。追逐十分激烈：追风筝的人蜂拥着漫过大街小巷，相互推搡，像西班牙人那样。我曾看过一本书，说起他们在斗牛节时被公牛追赶的景象。有一年某个邻居的小孩爬上松树，去捡风筝，结果树枝不堪重负，他从三十英尺高的地方跌下来，摔得再也无法行走，但他跌下来时手里还抓着那只风筝。如果追风筝的人手里拿着风筝，没有人能将它拿走。这不是规则，而是风俗。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="多年过去，我曾见到无数家伙参与追风筝，但哈桑是我见过的人中最精此道的高手。十分奇怪的是，在风筝跌落之前，他总是等在那个它将要跌落的地方，似乎他体内有某种指南针。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For kite runners, the most coveted prize was the last fallen kite of a winter tournament. It was a trophy of honor, something to be displayed on a mantle for guests to admire. When the sky cleared of kites and only the final two remained, every kite runner readied himself for the chance to land this prize. He positioned himself at a spot that he thought would give him a head start. Tense muscles readied themselves to uncoil. Necks craned. Eyes crinkled. Fights broke out. And when the last kite was cut, all hell broke loose.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对追风筝的人来说，最大的奖励是在冬天的比赛中捡到最后掉落的那只风筝。那是无上的荣耀，人们会将其挂在壁炉架之下，供客人欢欣赞叹。每当满天风筝消失得只剩下最后两只，每个追风筝的人都厉兵秣马，准备摘取此项大奖。他们会朝向那个他们预计风筝跌落的地方，绷紧的肌肉蓄势待发，脖子抬起，眼睛眯着，斗志昂扬。当最后一只风筝被割断，立即一片骚动。">查看中文翻译</div>

Maybe not "changed", not really, but suddenly I had the feeling I was looking at two faces, the one I knew, the one that was my first memory, and another, a second face, this one lurking just beneath the surface. I'd seen it happen before -- it always shook me up a little. It just appeared, this other face, for a fraction of a moment, long enough to leave me with the unsettling feeling that maybe I'd seen it someplace before. Then Hassan blinked and it was just him again. Just Hassan.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他久久看着我的脸。我们坐在那儿，两个男孩，坐在一棵酸樱桃树下，突然间我们看着，真的看着对方。就在那时，哈桑的脸又变了。也许没有变，不是真的变了，但我瞬间觉得自己看到了两张脸，一张是我认得的，我从小熟悉的；另外一张，第二张，就隐藏在表层之下。我曾经看到过他的脸色变化——总是吓我一跳，它每次出现不过惊鸿一瞥，但足以让我疑惑不安，觉得自己也许曾在什么地方见到过。随后，哈桑眨眨眼，他又是他了，只是哈桑了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But I wonder," he added. "Would you ever ask me to do such a thing, Amir agha?" And, just like that, he had thrown at me his own little test. If I was going to toy with him and challenge his loyalty, then he'd toy with me, test my integrity.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不过我怀疑，”他补充说，“你是否会让我这么做。你会吗，阿米尔少爷？”就这样，轮到他考验我了。如果我继续戏弄他，考验他的忠诚，那么他会戏弄我，考验我的正直。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Here it comes," Hassan said, pointing to the sky. He rose to his feet and walked a few paces to his left. I looked up, saw the kite plummeting toward us. I heard footfalls, shouts, an approaching melee of kite runners. But they were wasting their time. Because Hassan stood with his arms wide open, smiling, waiting for the kite. And may God -- if He exists, that is-strike me blind if the kite didn't just drop into his outstretched arms.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“风筝来了。”哈桑说，指向天空，他站起身来，朝左边走了几步。我抬头，望见风筝正朝我们一头扎下来。我听见脚步声，叫喊声，一群追风筝的人正闹哄哄向这边跑来。但他们只是白费时间。因为哈桑脸带微笑，张开双手，站在那儿等着风筝。除非真主——如果他存在的话——弄瞎了我的眼，不然风筝一定会落进他张开的臂弯里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One night that winter, with the big contest only four days away, Baba and I sat in his study in overstuffed leather chairs by the glow of the fireplace. We were sipping tea, talking. Ali had served dinner earlier -- potatoes and curried cauliflower over rice -- and had retired for the night with Hassan. Baba was fattening his pipe and I was asking him to tell the story about the winter a pack of wolves had descended from the mountains in Herat and forced everyone to stay indoors for a week, when he lit a match and said, casually, "I think maybe you'll win the tournament this year. What do you think?"</div>

<div class="line_en">I didn't know what to think. Or what to say. Was that what it would take? Had he just slipped me a key? I was a good kite fighter. Actually, a very good one. A few times, I'd even come close to winning the winter tournament -- once, I'd made it to the final three. But coming close wasn't the same as winning, was it? Baba hadn't "come close". He had won because winners won and everyone else just went Home. Baba was used to winning, winning at everything he set his mind to. Didn't he have a right to expect the same from his son? And just imagine. If I did win…</div>

<div class="line_en">Baba smoked his pipe and talked. I pretended to listen. But I couldn't listen, not really, because Baba's casual little comment had planted a seed in my head: the resolution that I would win that winter's tournament. I was going to win. There was no other viable option. I was going to win, and I was going to run that last kite. Then I'd bring it Home and show it to Baba. Show him once and for all that his son was worthy. Then maybe my life as a ghost in this house would finally be over. I let myself dream: I imagined conversation and laughter over dinner instead of silence broken only by the clinking of silverware and the occasional grunt. I envisioned us taking a Friday drive in Baba's car to Paghman, stopping on the way at Ghargha Lake for some fried trout and potatoes. We'd go to the zoo to see Marjan the lion, and maybe Baba wouldn't yawn and steal looks at his wristwatch all the time. Maybe Baba would even read one of my stories. I'd write him a hundred if I thought he'd read one. Maybe he'd call me Amir jan like Rahim Khan did. And maybe, just maybe, I would finally be pardoned for killing my mother.</div>

Earlier that day, I'd asked Ali to set up the kursi for us -- which was basically an electric heater under a low table covered with a thick, quilted blanket. Around the table, he arranged mattresses and cushions, so as many as twenty people could sit and slip their legs under. Hassan and I used to spend entire snowy days snug under the kursi, playing chess, cards-mostly panjpar.</div>

<div class="line_en">I sighed. "Those Iranians…" For a lot of Hazaras, Iran represented a sanctuary of sorts -- I guess because, like Hazaras, most Iranians were Shi'a Muslims. But I remembered something my teacher had said that summer about Iranians, that they were grinning smooth talkers who patted you on the back with one hand and picked your pocket with the other. I told Baba about that and he said my teacher was one of those jealous Afghans, jealous because Iran was a rising power in Asia and most people around the world couldn't even find Afghanistan on a world map. "It hurts to say that," he said, shrugging. "But better to get hurt by the truth than comforted with a lie."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我叹了一口气：“那些伊朗人…”对多数哈扎拉人来说，伊朗是个避难所，我猜想也许是因为多数伊朗人跟哈扎拉人一样，都是什叶派穆斯林。但我记得夏天的时候有个老师说起伊朗人，说他们都是笑面虎，一边用手拍拍你的后背示好，另一只手却会去掏你的口袋。我将这个告诉爸爸，爸爸说我的老师不过是个嫉妒的阿富汗人，他嫉妒，因为伊朗在亚洲声望日隆，而世界上多数人看世界地图的时候还找不到阿富汗在哪里。“这样说很伤感情，”他说，耸着肩，“但被真相伤害总比被谎言安慰好。”">查看中文翻译</div>
