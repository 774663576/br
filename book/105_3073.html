<div class="line_en">It seemed to Dylan that Tristan's anger was slow to fade. He sat in one of the hard-backed chairs in the cottage, his arms folded across his chest, his gaze firmly directed at the fireplace. The one or two tentative stabs she'd made at conversation had been closed down before they could begin and she'd retreated to the narrow, uncomfortable bed. She lay on her side, her arm the only pillow, and stared at his silhouette.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对迪伦来说，崔斯坦的怒气似乎消散得很慢。他坐在屋子里一把硬靠背椅上，抱着臂，执拗地注视着壁炉。有那么一两次她试着想和他说说话，结果最后都冷场了。她只有独自退回到那张狭窄别扭的床上，侧身躺下，头枕着胳膊，痴望着他的身影。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But Tristan wasn't angry. Staring into the pit of the hearth he couldn't feel the heat of fury, just the cold lead of doubt and uncertainty. He was worried. They were halfway back to the train, had already overcome the most dangerous obstacles, and none of them had been enough to convince Dylan to stop, to give up this reckless endeavour and return to the safety of her new life beyond the wasteland line, where she'd be safe. He wondered why he wasn't arguing with her; why he was letting her drag him further and further away from where she was supposed to be. The answer was obvious, and it aggravated him even more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其实，崔斯坦并没有生气。他盯着炉膛，心里不是怒火中烧，而是像灌了一坨冰冷的铅，只觉疑虑不安，前途未卜，忧心忡忡。他们现在回去，路程已经走了一半，并且已经克服了最危险的险阻，重重障碍都没能让迪伦止步，放弃这种冒险的举动，重新回归荒原边界外安全的新生活。他纳闷自己为什么不和她争辩，为什么纵容她拉着自己离她本应该待的地方越走越远。答案是明摆着的，这让他心里更加窝火。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She wasn't sorry. Some of the guilt she'd been carrying around since the poor woman had been set upon through Dylan's carelessness had lifted. She could never bring that soul back, she knew, but at least her presence here had done something good. And she hadn't been hurt, hadn't been taken. So really, Tristan had nothing to be angry about, she thought.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她并不后悔。自从因为自己的粗疏大意，害得那个可怜的女人丧了命，她心里一直背负着沉重的罪恶感，现在她可以减轻一点良心上的不安了。她知道自己永无可能让那个女人再活过来，但至少她在这里也做了一点点好事。而且她也没有受伤，没有被魔鬼抓去。她想，崔斯坦真的没必要生那么大的气。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Weakness, that's what it was. He was weak, giving in to her, letting himself hope that at the end of this journey they just might get to be together. Weakness. And tonight it had almost got her killed. But looking over his shoulder, taking in the way she stared at him, her eyes wide and defiant, her whole body crying out for comfort, he knew he didn't have it in him to tell her no. To take control and force her to follow him. He could, he knew. He'd done it before in those early days.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="软弱，就是这么回事。他性格太软弱了，所以才会对她让步妥协，幻想在旅途的终点能与她永远在一起。他的软弱，今天晚上几乎让她葬送了性命。然而回想过去，观察她盯着自己的样子，看着她睁大的双眼中那种无所畏惧的光芒，崔斯坦明白自己根本无法拒绝她。他知道，他完全能够重新掌控局面，逼着她跟着自己走。他在前些日子里就是这样做的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tristan sighed and stood, shoving the chair aside with his foot. "Is there room on that thing for two?" he asked, wandering over to her and pointing to the rickety bed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="崔斯坦叹了口气，站在那里，把椅子踢到一边，“有双人床的房间吗？”他一边问，一边踱到她身边，指了指摇摇欲坠的床。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dylan smiled at him, her expression saturated with relief, before she scooted back to the wall, making just enough space for him to spread out. When he lay down beside her their bodies touched from head to toe and he had to grip her waist or risk toppling off. She didn't seem to mind, though. Her smile widened and a blush tinged her cheeks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦对他一笑，脸上的表情显得如释重负。她往墙边退了退，给他腾出地方舒展身体。他们并排躺着，头对头，脚碰脚。他只能搂着她的腰，否则就有从床上翻落之虞。但她似乎并不在意，她的笑意渐浓，面带一片红晕。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Good," he grunted. Then he pressed his lips gently against her forehead. "Rest," he murmured. "We've got a long way to go tomorrow."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好啊。”他哼了一声，然后轻轻地吻了下她的额头，“休息吧。”他小声嘀咕地说，“明天我们还要赶很远的路呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tristan smirked wryly. That wasn't the same thing at all. It was probably the only apology he was going to get, though.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="崔斯坦苦笑了一下。这根本就是两码事，但这可能是他能得到的唯一道歉了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I really am sorry about before," she whispered. Then she grimaced slightly and rephrased. "I'm sorry for making you worry."</div>

<div class="line_en">He shifted on the bed, turning to lie on his back, and pulled Dylan onto his chest. She nestled her head into his shoulder, smiling to herself. What would Katie say if she saw her now? She wouldn't believe her. If she and Tristan did make it back, that was going to be one hell of an MSN conversation. Then after that, at school. She tried to imagine Tristan sitting beside her in class, writing an essay, watching the paper aeroplanes fly overhead. What would he think about the idiots at Kaithshall? Dylan could picture his horrified face. She laughed quietly, but refused to explain to Tristan when he lifted his head to eye her curiously.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他在床上翻身平躺好，把迪伦拉到自己胸前。她的头依偎在他的肩上，暗自微笑。如果凯蒂现在看见自己会怎么说？她不会相信自己说的话。如果她和崔斯坦真的穿越了回去，在MSN上要和她聊个够。然后他们会回到学校，她尽力想象着在班上崔斯坦坐在自己身边，写着作文，看着纸飞机从头顶飞过时的场景。他会怎么评价那些吉斯夏尔中学的白痴们？迪伦能想象出他惊骇的表情。她恬然一笑，但当崔斯坦转头好奇地看着她时，她却没做任何解释。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Are you sure?" Dylan asked, but she was already reaching for it. Gratefully, she yanked the heavy fabric over her head, pulling the arms down until they covered her hands entirely. "Ooh, that's better," she said, shivering a little as she felt the warmth from his body heat against her skin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你真的让给我穿？”迪伦一边问，一边伸手去接。她满心感激地把厚厚的衣服套在头上，然后把衣服袖子往下拉，直到它们完全盖住她的双手，“哦，现在感觉好多了。”她的皮肤接触到他残留的体温，不由打了一个寒战。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Here," he said, sliding his arms out of the sleeves. "Wear this."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嗨，”他说着，把胳膊从袖子里退出来，“穿上这个。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the morning, a thin veil of mist hovered over the wasteland, hiding the highest of the peaks from view. Tristan didn't comment on it, but pulled the long sleeves of his jumper down to cover his arms. Then he looked at Dylan. Her T-shirt was thin and ripped in places. It wouldn't offer much protection against the bite of the cold morning air.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="清晨，浓雾笼罩着荒原，让一座座危峰在视线中隐迹藏形。崔斯坦没说话，只是把罩衫的长袖拽下来盖住胳膊。然后他看看迪伦，她的T恤很薄，上面已经开了很多口子，很难抵御早上冷空气的侵袭。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tristan grinned at her, his eyes raking up and down her body. She smiled back impishly, knowing she probably looked like a child in a grown-up's clothes. The jumper was ridiculously big for her, but it was cosy and, as she dipped her chin down to warm her nose against the collar, she realised it smelled of him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他开怀大笑，上下打量着她。她冲他羞涩一笑，知道自己可能看上去就像是披了件大人衣服的小孩。对她来说，这件罩衫简直太大了，但穿着很温暖。她缩着下巴，想用衣领暖一下鼻子，这时她闻到了他身上的味道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="她的目光扫到了某个她清楚记得的熟悉景色，迪伦心里一阵惊喜。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan eyed the nearest hill, its top was still hidden by the low-slung cloud, and nodded her head morosely.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦眼望着最近的一座山，山顶依然锁在低垂的云雾中。她坚定地点了点头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Ready?" he asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“准备好了吗？”他问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They walked steadily, climbing throughout the morning. Though the swirling fog lifted, retreating further up into the sky, it didn't completely dissipate and so the day stayed cold. Despite Dylan telling Tristan she would take the lead, he forged a path for them. He had to; Dylan had no idea which way to go. She tried to think back to making this journey the first time, marching in the opposite direction. Had she known yet that she was dead?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们迈着坚实的步伐上路，整个早上都在爬山。尽管四周盘旋的浓雾正在消散，退向高空，但尚未完全散尽，空气依然寒冷。迪伦告诉过崔斯坦她要带路，但崔斯坦还是走在了前面。他只能这样做，迪伦不知道要走哪条路。她尽力回想第一次来时的道路，朝相反的方向行进。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"We're nearly at the safe house," she said. And sure enough, as soon as the words were out of her mouth she lifted her head and there, just beyond the pasture, was the cabin. The little wooden cabin where she'd learned why she had been the only one to crawl her way out of the train carriage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们就快到安全屋了。”她说。果然，话刚一出口，她抬头就看见草地远处正是那间小屋。正是在这间小木屋里，她弄明白了为什么只有自己爬出了车厢。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你看，我有个想法。”她的声音很低，不想破坏此刻的宁静。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That thought nudged something at the back of Dylan's memory. Another dream, walking hand in hand with a handsome stranger. The last dream she'd had before all of this insanity had started. The setting was wrong: the heavy dampness of the forest replaced by the tranquil exquisiteness of the meadow, but the feeling, the sense of happiness, of completeness, was the same. And though the man in the dream had never really had a face, Dylan knew instinctively that it had been Tristan. Had her mind had some inkling that all of this was going to unfold? That it was meant to be? Destiny? That seemed impossible, but still…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这么一想，倒是激活了迪伦脑海深处的记忆片段。那也是一个梦，梦中的她和一个英俊的陌生人手挽手走路。那是这一切匪夷所思的事情开始前迪伦做的最后一个梦，但是梦的背景和此时大不相同—湿漉漉的树林换成了现在宁静祥和、赏心悦目的草地。然而那种心境，那种幸福满足的感觉却和此时一模一样。尽管当时始终看不清梦中人的面容，但迪伦的直觉告诉她那就是崔斯坦。在这所有的一切发生之前，难道她心里早有预感？天意如此？命中注定？这似乎是不可能的，但……">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Though the sun was hidden, the light was still strong and for once they didn't have to rush. Instead Tristan seemed content to amble along, his fingers wrapped tightly around Dylan's. The path was really too narrow for two people to walk abreast, but as their legs gently brushed against the wildflowers, delicate scents bloomed up to perfume the air. It was picture perfect, like a dream.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管太阳藏了起来，但光线依然充足。至少这一次他们不用着急地赶路了。崔斯坦似乎悠然自得，紧紧攥着迪伦的手，信步而行。小路太窄了，实在容不下两人并排走。然而当他们的腿轻轻掠过那些野花时，一股清香绽放，弥散在空气里。眼前的景色过于完美，犹如梦境。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="她不知道这是在安慰他还是安慰自己。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He trailed his fingers down her face as he dropped his hand, and Dylan blushed furiously, her cheeks scarlet. Tristan laughed at her and grabbed her hand again. With gentle pressure, he urged her a little faster towards the cabin. Just in case.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的手指顺着迪伦的脸颊缓缓划过，迪伦的脸臊得通红。崔斯坦哂笑着又重新拉起了她的手，他指间温柔的压力在催促她步子稍微快一点，以防万一。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I will remember you," she whispered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我会记得你。”她低声说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tristan gave her a sad smile. "Hope so," he replied. Then he kissed her, lowering his head and brushing his lips against hers. As he pulled away, she realised he had something in his hand, cupped gently between his thumb and forefinger. A flower, its delicate stem almost bowed with the weight of the vibrant purple petals. "Here." He slipped it into the thick folds of her hair. "It brings out the colour of your eyes."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="崔斯坦苦笑了一下，“但愿如此。”他说。接着他低头吻了她。当他起身的时候，她注意到他拇指和食指间藏着什么东西。是一朵花，纤细的花茎在鲜亮的紫色花瓣重压下微微弯曲。“给你，”他把花轻轻插进迪伦浓密的发髻中，“这花更衬出你眼睛的颜色。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That night passed far too quickly as far as Dylan was concerned, and yet, at the same time, not quickly enough. She wanted to savour every second with Tristan, but she worried that every time they stopped like this, he would try and find other ways, other arguments, to convince her to turn around. He was in a good mood, however, laughing and joking and, though Dylan wasn't entirely sure it was genuine, she couldn't help but be swept along. He even convinced her to dance with him, singing a tune -- just slightly out of key -- as there was no music bar the whistling and wailing of the wraiths, shut out from the cabin in the cold and dark.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对迪伦来说，那一晚过得太快了，同时又过得不够快。她一面想尽情品味与崔斯坦相处的每分每秒，一面又担心每次他们像这样停下来，他就会想方设法找一些理由，劝她返身回去。但他今天心情不错，一直在说说笑笑，促狭打趣。虽然迪伦还不能完全确定他是不是真的这么开心，但自己的情绪也不由自主地被他带动了起来。他甚至说服迪伦跟自己一起跳起了舞—除了小屋外寒冷黑暗中恶魔们的鬼哭狼嚎声，没什么声音可以伴奏。所以他开始小声哼唱，虽然略微有些跑调。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"All right, all right!" Tristan replied, but he was smiling at her indulgently, shaking his head at her eagerness. "Used to be I couldn't get you moving in the morning. I had to just about drag you out of the door."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好啦，走吧！”崔斯坦回答。他冲着迪伦恣肆地笑着，她急不可耐的样子让他直摇头，“以前早上我都叫不动你，就差拖着你到外面去了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He laughed. "Misery is maybe too strong a word. Nightmare, perhaps…" He trailed off, and winked at her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他笑了， “ 要说吃苦头可能言重了， 也许说是噩梦更合适……”他越说声音越小，对着她眨巴了一下眼睛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She was surprised when the light began to change outside, but as soon as it was obvious that dawn was on the way, she started to harass Tristan, eager to get going. He took his time, though, stamping out the last glowing embers in the grate, brushing up rogue piles of ash with his shoe. Then, even though there was no more reason to delay, he refused outright to let Dylan sweep open the door before the sun peaked over the first of the hills, far out to the east.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="外面的光线开始变化时，迪伦还在惊诧时间过得飞快。可一到晨空破晓，她马上就去催崔斯坦赶紧上路。而他却显得不慌不忙，踩灭了炉膛里最后一点散发着光热的余烬，掸去鞋上厚厚的一层尘土。然后，尽管已经没什么再拖延下去的理由，他还是一口回绝了迪伦，不让她打开屋门，一直到太阳从远处东面群山的峰顶之上升起。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan grinned at him, remembering how she'd pouted, whined, complained. "I must have made your life a bit of a misery at first," she admitted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="想起那时自己噘着嘴发牢骚、哭哭啼啼的样子，迪伦也不禁莞尔，“刚开始的时候我肯定让你吃了苦头吧？”她坦白道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Can we go now?" Dylan moaned when at last rays of light poured through the cabin's windows.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dylan made a face at the broad width of his shoulders, sticking her tongue out. She wasn't really looking forward to the final safe house, either, because she remembered it as a total wreck: no roof, and only one wall still standing tall. It was also the last real obstacle between them and the tunnel and Dylan knew, she just knew, that Tristan was going to use this as a last chance to talk her out of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦对着他宽宽的肩膀伸出舌头，做了个鬼脸。她并不真的期盼到达最后一个安全屋，因为在她的记忆中那完全是一片废墟—没有屋顶，只有一面墙依然挺立。这也是他们和那条隧道之间最后一道真正的屏障。迪伦知道，她就是知道，崔斯坦会利用这最后的机会劝自己放弃。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Nightmare!" Dylan left her sentry post by the door to shove jokingly at his arm. "I'm not a nightmare!" Then she turned and looked outside, at the unending hills of the wasteland that waited for her. "It feels easier going this way, though. Like going downhill." She shrugged, went back to mock glower at Tristan. "So get moving!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噩梦！”一直站在门边向外张望的迪伦走过来半开玩笑地推了一把他的胳膊，“我可不是什么噩梦！”然后她又转身，注视着门外，看着荒原上等待他们穿越的连绵群山，“感觉这样走要容易些，像走下山路。”她耸耸肩，又假装嗔怒地瞪了崔斯坦一眼说，“那我们出发吧！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Remember how long it took us to get to the cabin last time?" he barked when her moaning at last broke through the final layer of his patience. "The wraiths caught us and I almost lost you. We have a long way to go, and this was your idea," he reminded her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“还记得上次我们花了多长时间才到小屋吗？当她的呻吟终于冲破了他最后一层耐心时，他狂吠起来。“魔鬼抓住了我们，我差点失去你。我们还有很长的路要走，这是你的主意，”他提醒她。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan's enthusiasm lasted until about halfway up the first hill. Then the burn set into her calves and a stitch erupted deep in her left side, stabbing with each gasping breath. Now, though, Tristan seemed to want to push on and he pretended to be deaf to her complaints and constant pleas for a break.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦的热情在第一座山爬到一半的时候就荡然无存了。她感到小腿火辣辣的，左肋深处传来一阵阵刺痛，每一次喘息都伴随着疼痛。不过现在崔斯坦似乎倒愿意奋力前行了，迪伦几次三番抱怨，数度要求休息，他都装聋作哑，充耳不闻。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She wasn't wrong. As soon as they were safely ensconced in the safe 'house', the wraiths no more than whispers chasing on their heels, thanks to the ruthless pace Tristan had set, and the fire was crackling merrily away, he sat down opposite her and fixed her with a very serious look.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她猜得没错。他们刚在安全屋安顿下来，恶魔们的咆哮声就马上减弱了，听起来就像追在身后的瑟瑟风声，能这么早到达全是拜崔斯坦寸步不停所赐。炉火欢快地噼啪作响，他坐在她对面，目光严肃地盯着她。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“迪伦……”崔斯坦踌躇着，咬着脸颊内侧，“迪伦，事情有些不对劲。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She pursed her lips, repressed a growl. "Look, we've already gone through this. You promised you'd give it a go. Tristan, we've come all this way. We can't go back now, not without --" She broke off. He'd held up a hand to halt her in her tracks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她噘着嘴，压着火没有大喊大叫，“你看，我们都已经走到这一步了。你答应过要试一试的。崔斯坦，我们这一路长途跋涉，我们现在不能回去，不是没有……”他举起一只手打断了这通连珠炮似的讲话，她突然住了口。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Look at this," he said softly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“看看这个吧。”他淡淡地说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He lifted his T-shirt, revealing his abdomen. At first Dylan was distracted by a thin trail of soft golden hair running downwards from his belly button, but she quickly saw what he was talking about.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他撩起自己的T恤，露出腹部。从他的肚脐处朝下长着一道并不浓密的金色汗毛，这让迪伦有些分神。不过她很快就看到了他指的是什么。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“对不起，”她喃喃地说，“都是我不好。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He had a raw red gash running in a jagged line down his right-hand side. The skin around the wound was puffy and inflamed and surrounded by shallower gashes.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“什么时候的伤？”她轻声问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan gaped at him silently. She hadn't thought her actions might hurt Tristan, but seeing him wince as he shifted on the seat, he was clearly in pain. How had he managed to hide this from her for a whole two days? Was she so self-absorbed that she hadn't noticed? She felt sick at herself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦目瞪口呆地看着他。她以前从没想到自己的行为会伤害崔斯坦。看到他在座位上挪动身子时痛得龇牙咧嘴的样子，她自己也痛苦万分。整整两天了，他是怎么尽力隐瞒伤势的呢？她是不是太自私了？否则怎么会察觉不到呢？她对自己感到极度失望。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He lowered his shirt, hiding the injury from her. "No." He shook his head. "That's not what I'm talking about, Dylan. It's the wound." She stared at him, not comprehending. "It's not healing," he explained. "It should have disappeared by now. Even when I was attacked before it healed within a few days. But now… it's like I'm… I'm…" He grimaced.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他把衣服放下来，藏起伤口，“不，”他摇摇头，“我想说的不是这个。迪伦，我是说这个伤口，”他解释道，“现在它应该已经消失了才对。以前我也受到过恶魔们的攻击，几天之内就会不治自愈的。可现在……好像我已经变成了……变成了……”他脸上露出了痛苦的表情。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“为什么？”迪伦困惑地皱起了眉头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I know." He nodded. "And at first I thought that maybe that was why I didn't go, that I had to stay until you were safely delivered again. But maybe that's not right.

<div class="line_cn" title="“我知道。”他点点头说，“一开始我也以为可能就是有你在，所以我才没有走，我必须要待到你被再次安全送回去为止。可是这样的想法可能不对，可能我现在……”他踌躇着，尽力想搜出一个合适的词，“可能我现在报废了或是发生了诸如此类的事情吧。”他冲她笑了一下，“我是说，我本来不可能像现在这样往回走的。这不正常，迪伦。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don't know," he murmured, keeping a lid firmly on the hope he felt, hope he didn't like admitting to, even to himself. He laughed. "I shouldn't even be here."</div>

<div class="line_en">Dylan didn't seem to share his uncertainty, his caution. She sat up straighter, her mouth widening into a grin, eyes bright. "Well… well apart from that…" She nodded towards Tristan's side which, she now realised, he was protecting with his right arm. "… everything seems to be working in our favour. Maybe we should just go with it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦似乎没有感受到他的不安和谨慎。她坐得笔直，嘴角绽放出灿烂的笑容，眼神发亮，“嗯，嗯，除此之外……”她朝崔斯坦身体右侧点点头，看到他在用右手遮掩，“……一切都在朝着对我们有利的方向发展，或许我们就应该顺势而为。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Maybe you're not broken," she said slowly. "Maybe you're fixed. Maybe, like you said, maybe when you'd done enough, ferried enough souls, you'd be finished."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Maybe," he said, but his eyes were doubtful. He didn't want to say anything to Dylan, but there was a niggling thought worrying at the back of his head.

Tristan couldn't help but wonder if it was something different that was in store for him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“或许吧。”他说，眼神中仍带着疑惑。他不想把一切事都告诉迪伦，但潜意识深处一直在隐隐担忧。他们穿越荒原，越走越远，他的伤口似乎也在逐渐恶化。迪伦感觉到自己正在奋力挣扎重获新生，可崔斯坦却禁不住担心等待着他的是不是截然不同的命运。">查看中文翻译</div>
