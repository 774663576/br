<div class="line_en">On February 24, 1815, the lookout at Notre-Dame de la Garde signalled the arrival of the three-master Pharaon, coming from Smyrna, Trieste and Naples. As usual, a coastal pilot immediately left the port, sailed hard by the Château d'If, and boarded the ship between the Cap de Morgiou and the island of Riou.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一八一五年二月二十四日，避风堰了望塔上的守望者，望见了从士麦拿经过的里雅斯特和那不勒斯来的三桅大帆船埃及王号。了望塔上发出了讯号，并立刻派出一位领港，绕过伊夫堡，在摩琴岬和里翁屿之间上了船。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At once (as was also customary) the terrace of Fort Saint-Jean was thronged with onlookers, because the arrival of a ship is always a great event in Marseille, particularly when the vessel, like the Pharaon, has been built, fitted out and laded in the shipyards of the old port and belongs to an owner from the town.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="圣·琪安堡的阳台上挤满了看热闹的人。在马赛，一艘船的进港始终是一件大事，尤其是象埃及王号这样的船，船主是本城人，船又是在佛喜船坞里建造装配的，就更吸引人的注意。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Meanwhile the ship was drawing near, and had successfully negotiated the narrows created by some volcanic upheaval between the islands of Calseraigne and Jarre; it had rounded Pomègue and was proceeding under its three topsails, its outer jib and its spanker, but so slowly and with such melancholy progress that the bystanders, instinctively sensing some misfortune, wondered what accident could have occurred on board. Nevertheless, those who were experts in nautical matters acknowledged that, if there had been such an accident, it could not have affected the vessel itself, for its progress gave every indication of a ship under perfect control: the anchor was ready to drop and the bowsprit shrouds loosed. Next to the pilot, who was preparing to guide the Pharaon through the narrow entrance to the port of Marseille, stood a young man, alert and sharp-eyed, supervising every movement of the ship and repeating each of the pilot's commands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="船渐渐驶近。它已安然通过了卡拉沙林屿和杰罗斯屿之间由几次火山爆发所造成的海峡，绕过波米琪，驶近港口。船上扯起中桅的上帆，前桅的三角帆和纵帆，但它驶得这样的缓慢和无精打采，以致那些看热闹的人本能地感觉到了不幸的预兆，互相探问船上究竟发生了什么不幸的事故。可是那些对航海有经验的人却清楚地看出，假如的确发生了任何意外的话，那一定与船的本身无关。因为从各方面看来，它并无丝毫失去操纵的象征。领港正在驾驶着埃及王号通过马赛港狭窄的进口。在领港的旁边，有一个青年打着迅速的手势，用他那敏锐的眼光注视着船的每一个动作，并复述领港的命令。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One of the spectators on the terrace of Fort Saint-Jean had been particularly affected by the vague sense of unease that hovered among them, so much so that he could not wait for the vessel to come to land; he leapt into a small boat and ordered it to be rowed out to the Pharaon, coming alongside opposite the cove of La Réserve. When he saw the man approaching, the young sailor left his place beside the pilot and, hat in hand, came and leant on the bulwarks of the ship.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弥漫在看客中的那种漠然的不安终于使其中有一位忍耐不住了，他来不及等帆船入港就跳进一只小艇迎上前去，那只小艇在船到里瑟夫湾对面的地方靠拢了埃及王号。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was a young man of between eighteen and twenty, tall, slim, with fine dark eyes and ebony-black hair. His whole demeanour possessed the calm and resolve peculiar to men who have been accustomed from childhood to wrestle with danger.</div>

<div class="line_en">The crew obeyed. As one man, the eight or ten sailors of which it was composed leapt, some to the sheets, others to the braces, others to the halyards, others to the jib, and still others to the brails. The young sailor glanced casually at the start of this operation and, seeing that his orders were being carried out, prepared to resume the conversation.</div>

<div class="line_en">"By heaven, Monsieur, in the most unexpected way imaginable: after a long conversation with the commander of the port, Captain Leclère left Naples in a state of great agitation. Twenty-four hours later, he was seized with fever and, three days after that, he was dead… We gave him the customary funeral and he now rests, decently wrapped in a hammock, with a thirty-six-pound cannonball at his feet and another at his head, off the island of Giglio. We've brought his medal and his sword back for his widow. Much good it did him," the young man continued, with a melancholy smile, "to fight the war against the English for ten years -- only to die at last, like anyone else, in his bed."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“唉，先生！完全是意想不到的事。在离开那不勒斯以前，黎克勒船长曾和那不勒斯港务长谈了很久。开船的时候，头里就觉得极不舒服。二十四小时以后，他就开始发烧，三天以后就死了。我们照常例海葬了他，他也可以安心长眠了。我们把他缝裹在吊床里，头尾放了两块三十六磅重的铅，就葬在艾尔及里奥岛外。我们把他的佩剑和铁十字荣誉章带了来留给他的太太做纪念。船长这一生总算也不虚度了。”青年的脸上露出一个忧郁的微笑，又说，“他和英国人作战了十年，到头来仍能象常人那样死在床上。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Dammit, Monsieur Edmond, what do you expect?" said the shipowner, who appeared to be finding more and more to console him in his grief. "We are all mortal.

<div class="line_cn" title="“现在请你上船来吧，摩莱尔先生，”邓蒂斯说，他看到船主已经有点着急，“你的押运员邓格拉司先生已走出船舱，他会把详细情形告诉你的。我还得去照顾下锚和给这只船挂丧。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The owner did not need asking twice. He grasped hold of a line that Dantès threw to him and, with an agility that would have done credit to a seaman, climbed the rungs nailed to the bulging side of the ship, while Dantès went back to his post and left the conversation to the man he had introduced as Danglars: the latter was indeed emerging from his cabin and coming across to the shipowner.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="船主立即抓住邓蒂斯抛给他的一条绳子，以水手一样敏捷的动作爬上船边，那青年去执行他的任务，把谈话的机会留给那个他称为邓格拉司的人。邓格拉司现在已向船主走来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This new arrival was a man, twenty-five to twenty-six years old, somewhat sombre in appearance, obsequious towards his superiors and insolent to his subordinates; hence, even apart from the label of supercargo, which always in itself causes aversion among sailors, he was generally as much disliked by the crew as Dantès was loved by them.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, Monsieur Morrel," said Danglars, "you have heard the bad news, I suppose?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Even so," the shipowner replied, watching Dantès while he searched for his mooring. "Even so, I think one need not be a seaman of such long experience as you say, Danglars, to know the business: there is our friend Edmond going about his, it seems to me, like a man who has no need to ask advice of anybody."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可是，”船主一边说，眼光却盯在正在指挥下锚的邓蒂斯身上，“在我看来，邓格拉司，一个水手要懂得他的职务，实在也不必象你所说的那样的老海员才行，因为你看，我们这位朋友爱德蒙，不需任何人的指示，似乎也完全称职了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Indeed," said Danglars, casting a sidelong glance at Dantès with a flash of hatred in his eyes. "Yes, indeed, he is young and full of self-confidence. The captain was hardly dead before he had taken command without asking anyone, and made us lose a day and a half on the island of Elba, instead of returning directly to Marseille."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，”邓格拉司向爱德蒙扫了一眼，露出忿恨的目光说，“是的，他很年轻，而年轻人总是自信甚强的。船长还没有断气，他就跟谁都不商量一下，竟自发号施令起来，而且还在爱尔巴岛耽搁了一天半，并不直航回马赛。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"As far as taking command of the ship is concerned," said the owner, "that was his duty as first mate. As for losing a day and a half at Elba, he was in the wrong, unless there was some damage to the ship that needed repairing."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“说到他负责这只船的指挥权，”摩莱尔回答，“他既然是大副，这应该是他的责任。至于在爱尔巴岛耽搁了一天半的时间，是他的错误，除非这只船需要修理。”">查看中文翻译</div>
