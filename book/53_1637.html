<div class="line_en">In the twilight of morphling, Peeta whispers the word and I go searching for him. It's a gauzy, violet-tinted world, with no hard edges, and many places to hide. I push through cloud banks, follow faint tracks, catch the scent of cinnamon, of dill. Once I feel his hand on my cheek and try to trap it, but it dissolves like mist through my fingers.</div>

<div class="line_en">When I finally begin to surface into the sterile hospital room in 13, I remember. I was under the influence of sleep syrup. My heel had been injured after I'd climbed out on a branch over the electric fence and dropped back into 12. Peeta had put me to bed and I had asked him to stay with me as I was drifting off. He had whispered something I couldn't quite catch. But some part of my brain had trapped his single word of reply and let it swim up through my dreams to taunt me now. "Always."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当我终于从幻觉中清醒过来，意识被拉回到十三区满是消毒水味的病房时，我才想起了在什么地方听到过这句话。那是十二区时，我从通电的隔离网上方跳回到十二区里面时，脚跟受了伤。妈妈给我喝了睡眠糖浆，皮塔把我抱到床上，迷迷糊糊快要睡着时，我求他陪在我身边。他在我耳边轻轻说了句话，我没有听懂。但这句话却印入我的大脑，现在又在梦中浮现出来戏弄我。“总是这样。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Morphling dulls the extremes of all emotions, so instead of a stab of sorrow, I merely feel emptiness. A hollow of dead brush where flowers used to bloom. Unfortunately, there's not enough of the drug left in my veins for me to ignore the pain in the left side of my body. That's where the bullet hit. My hands fumble over the thick bandages encasing my ribs and I wonder what I'm still doing here.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吗啡可以舒缓人们极端的情绪，所以此时我并不觉得痛苦，而只是觉得心里空荡荡的，就像过去盛开着花朵的地方，现在只有一堆枯死的灌木。不幸的是，药劲还不够大，我仍能感觉到身体左侧的疼痛。子弹就打到了这里。我用手摸摸肋骨上紧缠着的绷带，纳闷自己怎么还好好地活着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No kidding, brainless." Johanna walks over and plunks down on my bed, sending spikes of pain shooting across my chest. When she grins at my discomfort, I know we're not in for some warm reunion scene. "Still a little sore?" With an expert hand, she quickly detaches the morphling drip from my arm and plugs it into a socket taped into the crook of her own. "They started cutting back my supply a few days ago. Afraid I'm going to turn into one of those freaks from Six. I've had to borrow from you when the coast was clear. Didn't think you'd mind."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没错，傻瓜。”约翰娜走过来，一屁股坐在我床上，引起我身体里针刺似的一阵疼痛。她看到我不舒服，高兴地咧开嘴笑了，我心里明白我们之间不会出现老友重逢后的热情和喜悦。“还有点儿疼，嗯？”说着，她熟练地把我的吗啡输液针头拔下来，插到她臂弯里的输液管上，“他们几天前开始给我减药量了，他们害怕我变成六区的那个怪人。所以趁着没人，我只好借你一点。你不会介意吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Maybe her treatment of me was all an act for the Capitol?</div>

<div class="line_en">Maybe it's more than the festivities. Maybe it's that we are all so starved for something good to happen that we want to be part of it. It would explain why -- when Plutarch has a fit over what the bride will wear -- I volunteer to take Annie back to my house in 12, where Cinna left a variety of evening clothes in a big storage closet downstairs. All of the wedding gowns he designed for me went back to the Capitol, but there are some dresses I wore on the Victory Tour. I'm a little leery about being with Annie since all I really know about her is that Finnick loves her and everybody thinks she's mad. On the hovercraft ride, I decide she's less mad than unstable. She laughs at odd places in the conversation or drops out of it distractedly. Those green eyes fixate on a point with such intensity that you find yourself trying to make out what she sees in the empty air. Sometimes, for no reason, she presses both her hands over her ears as if to block out a painful sound. All right, she's strange, but if Finnick loves her, that's good enough for me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="也许大家的兴奋与快乐并不仅仅是因为这场婚礼，而是对美好事物的极度渴望，而每个人都想成为这美好事物的一部分。这也说明了普鲁塔什为新娘穿什么而发了通脾气的原因。解决的办法是，我自愿带新娘到我十二区的家中，因为在地下室的衣柜里，有许多西纳给我设计的晚礼服。他为我设计的婚纱都已运回了凯匹特，但还剩下一些我在胜利巡演时穿的礼服。和安妮在一起，我还心存戒备，因为我知道的一切就是芬尼克很爱她，大家都认为她疯了。在去十二区的飞机上，我发现她与其说是疯了，倒不如说情绪很不稳定。我们说话时，她不知怎的就会笑起来，或者心不在焉地停止讲话。有时，那双绿眼睛会死死地盯着某个物体看个不停，致使人们以为她真的在空中看到了什么。有时，她无缘无故地就会用双手把耳朵捂上，好像要隔开什么令人痛苦的声音。好吧，她是有些怪怪的，可要是芬尼克爱她，我也没什么好说的了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I got permission for my prep team to come along, so I'm relieved of having to make any fashion decisions. When I open the closet, we all fall silent because Cinna's presence is so strong in the flow of the fabrics. Then Octavia drops to her knees, rubs the hem of a skirt against her cheek, and bursts into tears. "It's been so long," she gasps, "since I've seen anything pretty."</div>

<div class="line_en">Despite reservations on Coin's side that it's too extravagant, and on Plutarch's side that it's too drab, the wedding is a smash hit. The three hundred lucky guests culled from 13 and the many refugees wear their everyday clothes, the decorations are made from autumn foliage, the music is provided by a choir of children accompanied by the lone fiddler who made it out of 12 with his instrument. So it's simple, frugal by the Capitol's standards. It doesn't matter because nothing can compete with the beauty of the couple. It isn't about their borrowed finery -- Annie wears a green silk dress I wore in 5, Finnick one of Peeta's suits that they altered -- although the clothes are striking. Who can look past the radiant faces of two people for whom this day was once a virtual impossibility? Dalton, the cattle guy from 10, conducts the ceremony, since it's similar to the one used in his district. But there are unique touches of District 4. A net woven from long grass that covers the couple during their vows, the touching of each other's lips with salt water, and the ancient wedding song, which likens marriage to a sea voyage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管科恩担心婚礼过于铺张而对一切竭力精简，普鲁塔什却觉得婚礼的安排过于单调乏味，但婚礼的举办仍然大获成功。从十三区精心挑选的三百个公民和许多难民身着日常服装参加了婚礼，婚礼现场用秋天的树叶精心装饰，孩子们演唱婚庆歌曲，来自十二区的孤独的提琴手用他从十二区逃难时带出来的提琴为大家演奏。按照凯匹特的标准，这确实是一场简朴的婚礼，可这又有什么关系呢？婚礼上的一对新人光彩照人。安妮穿着我在五区巡演时穿的绿色丝裙，芬尼克穿的礼服由皮塔原来的衣服修改而成。但他们的美丽漂亮却并不是因为这些借来的衣服——尽管衣服也很漂亮，而是因为他们脸上放射出的幸福的光彩，要知道，这是一场原以为不可能的婚礼啊！道尔顿，来自十区的放牛娃，为他们主持了婚礼，因为这场婚礼与他们区的婚礼很相似。最特别的还是四区的创意，在新郎新娘宣誓时，他们用长长的草编织的网子罩在一对新人身上；新郎新娘把盐水洒在对方的嘴唇上，婚礼上还演唱了古老的婚庆歌曲，这首歌把婚礼比作了海上的远航。">查看中文翻译</div>

"Are you going to miss the chance to let Snow see you dancing?" She's right. What could spell victory louder than a happy Mockingjay twirling around to music? I find Prim in the crowd. Since winter evenings gave us a lot of time to practice, we're actually pretty good partners. I brush off her concerns about my ribs, and we take our places in the line.
