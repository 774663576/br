<div class="line_en">The struggle for admission to college was ended, and I could now enter Radcliffe whenever I pleased. Before I entered college, however, it was thought best that I should study another year under Mr. Keith. It was not, therefore, until the fall of 1900 that my dream of going to college was realized.</div>

<div class="line_en">I remember my first day at Radcliffe. It was a day full of interest for me. I had looked forward to it for years. A potent force within me, stronger than the persuasion of my friends, stronger even than the pleadings of my heart, had impelled me to try my strength by the standards of those who see and hear. I knew that there were obstacles in the way; but I was eager to overcome them. I had taken to heart the words of the wise Roman who said, "To be banished from Rome is but to live outside of Rome."Debarred from the great highways of knowledge, I was compelled to make the journey across country by unfrequented roads -- that was all; and I knew that in college there were many bypaths where I could touch hands with girls who were thinking, loving and struggling like me.</div>

<div class="line_en">I began my studies with eagerness. Before me I saw a new world opening in beauty and light, and I felt within me the capacity to know all things. In the wonderland of Mind I should be as free as another. Its people, scenery, manners, joys, tragedies should be living, tangible interpreters of the real world. The lecture-halls seemed filled with the spirit of the great and the wise, and I thought the professors were the embodiment of wisdom. If I have since learned differently, I am not going to tell anybody.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我热切地开始了大学学习。我看到面前出现了一个美丽而光明的新世界，自信有能力掌握一切知识。在精神的奇境里，我应该与别人一样自由。这个王国的子民、风景、习俗、欢乐和悲伤也应该是真实世界生动具体的反映。在我看来，这里的讲堂里挤满了伟大而睿智的灵魂，教授们都是智慧的化身。如果我从此以后有了不同的学习方法，没人会觉得奇怪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The one I felt and still feel most is lack of time. I used to have time to think, to reflect, my mind and I. We would sit together of an evening and listen to the inner melodies of the spirit, which one hears only in leisure moments when the words of some loved poet touch a deep, sweet chord in the soul that until then had been silent. But in college there is no time to commune with one's thoughts. One goes to college to learn, it seems, not to think. When one enters the portals of learning, one leaves the dearest pleasures -- solitude, books and imagination -- outside with the whispering pines. I suppose I ought to find some comfort in the thought that I am laying up treasures for future enjoyment, but I am improvident enough to prefer present joy to hoarding riches against a rainy day.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我过去感到、现在依然感受到的不利因素是缺乏时间。我曾经有时间沉思、反省，与心灵对话。我们常常在晚间静坐，聆听心灵深处的乐音。这乐音只有在安闲时刻才能听到。此时，心爱诗人吟诵的诗行拨动那沉寂已久、低沉悦耳的心弦。而在大学里，人们没有时间与心灵对话。他们上大学仿佛只是为了学习，而不是思考。进入大学之门后，人们将许多最宝贵的乐趣——孤独、书本和想象——连同那窃窃私语的松树一起弃之门外。我估计应该这样来安慰自己：我现在累积财富为的是将来享受，但我并无远谋，宁可即时享受，不愿未雨绸缪。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I am frequently asked how I overcome the peculiar conditions under which I work in college. In the classroom I am of course practically alone. The professor is as remote as if he were speaking through a telephone. The lectures are spelled into my hand as rapidly as possible, and much of the individuality of the lecturer is lost to me in the effort to keep in the race. The words rush through my hand like hounds in pursuit of a hare which they often miss. But in this respect I do not think I am much worse off than the girls who take notes. If the mind is occupied with the mechanical process of hearing and putting words on paper at pell-mell speed, I should not think one could pay much attention to the subject under consideration or the manner in which it is presented. I cannot make notes during the lectures, because my hands are busy listening. Usually I jot down what I can remember of them when I get home. I write the exercises, daily themes, criticisms and hour-tests, the mid-year and final examinations, on my typewriter, so that the professors have no difficulty in finding out how little I know. When I began the study of Latin prosody, I devised and explained to my professor a system of signs indicating the different meters and quantities.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="常有人问起，我是怎样克服大学里学习的种种不便的。当然，我在教室里实际上是孤独的。教授的声音很遥远，仿佛在通过电话讲课。授课内容会被快速拼写到我手上，我在努力赶速度时，授课者的个性特点在我面前消失了。词语奔过我的手心，恰如猎犬追逐野兔，往往追不上。不过，我认为在这方面，自己并不比用笔记录的姑娘差。如果一个人一边机械地听课一边手忙脚乱地记录，那么，我觉得他就不可能留意讲课的主题和该主题提出的方式。我无法在上课时做笔记，因为我的双手正忙于听讲。通常，我到家后会把能记得的内容草草写下来。我在打字机上做习题，写每日短文、评论，完成测验、学期考试、学年考试。这样，教授们就不难发现我知道的多么有限。我开始学习拉丁语诗体学时，设计了一套显示不同韵律和音长的系统，并解释给教授听。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My studies the first year were French, German, history, English composition and English literature. In the French course I read some of the works of Corneille, Moliere, Racine, Alfred de Musset and Sainte-Beuve, and in the German those of Goethe and Schiller. I reviewed rapidly the whole period of history from the fall of the Roman Empire to the eighteenth century, and in English literature studied critically Milton's poems and "Areopagitica."</div>

<div class="line_en">Very few of the books required in the various courses are printed for the blind, and I am obliged to have them spelled into my hand. Consequently I need more time to prepare my lessons than other girls. The manual part takes longer, and I have perplexities which they have not. There are days when the close attention I must give to details chafes my spirit, and the thought that I must spend hours reading a few chapters, while in the world without other girls are laughing and singing and dancing, makes me rebellious; but I soon recover my buoyancy and laugh the discontent out of my heart. For, after all, everyone who wishes to gain true knowledge must climb the Hill Difficulty alone, and since there is no royal road to the summit, I must zigzag it in my own way. I slip back many times, I fall, I stand still, I run against the edge of hidden obstacles, I lose my temper and find it again and keep it better, I trudge on, I gain a little, I feel encouraged, I get more eager and climb higher and begin to see the widening horizon. Every struggle is a victory. One more effort and I reach the luminous cloud, the blue depths of the sky, the uplands of my desire. I am not always alone, however, in these struggles. Mr. William Wade and Mr. E. E. Allen, Principal of the Pennsylvania Institution for the Instruction of the Blind, get for me many of the books I need in raised print. Their thoughtfulness has been more of a help and encouragement to me than they can ever know.</div>

<div class="line_en">Last year, my second year at Radcliffe, I studied English composition, the Bible as English composition, the governments of America and Europe, the Odes of Horace, and Latin comedy. The class in composition was the pleasantest. It was very lively. The lectures were always interesting, vivacious, witty; for the instructor, Mr. Charles Townsend Copeland, more than anyone else I have had until this year, brings before you literature in all its original freshness and power. For one short hour you are permitted to drink in the eternal beauty of the old masters without needless interpretation or exposition. You revel in their fine thoughts. You enjoy with all your soul the sweet thunder of the Old Testament, forgetting the existence of Jahweh and Elohim; and you go home feeling that you have had "a glimpse of that perfection in which spirit and form dwell in immortal harmony; truth and beauty bearing a new growth on the ancient stem of time."</div>

<div class="line_en">But college is not the universal Athens I thought it was. There one does not meet the great and the wise face to face; one does not even feel their living touch. They are there, it is true; but they seem mummified. We must extract them from the crannied wall of learning and dissect and analyze them before we can be sure that we have a Milton or an Isaiah, and not merely a clever imitation. Many scholars forget, it seems to me, that our enjoyment of the great works of literature depends more upon the depth of our sympathy than upon our understanding. The trouble is that very few of their laborious explanations stick in the memory. The mind drops them as a branch drops its overripe fruit. It is possible to know a flower, root and stem and all, and all the processes of growth, and yet to have no appreciation of the flower fresh bathed in heaven's dew. Again and again I ask impatiently, "Why concern myself with these explanations and hypotheses?" They fly hither and thither in my thought like blind birds beating the air with ineffectual wings. I do not mean to object to a thorough knowledge of the famous works we read. I object only to the interminable comments and bewildering criticisms that teach but one thing: there are as many opinions as there are men. But when a great scholar like Professor Kittredge interprets what the master said, it is "as if new sight were given the blind." He brings back Shakespeare, the poet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，大学并不是我原先想象的包罗万象的雅典。你在这里不会与伟人和智者面对面，甚至感觉不到他们的现实存在。然而，他们确实存在，不过似乎已经僵化。我们需要从知识的残垣里将其抽取出来，并对其进行细致的剖析后，才能确信拥有真实的弥尔顿或以赛亚，而不只是巧妙的赝品。在我看来，很多学者似乎忘记，欣赏伟大的文学作品，与其说是依赖我们的理解力，不如说是依赖我们的共鸣。麻烦的是，费尽口舌的讲解偏偏留不下什么记忆，人们弃之犹如枝头落下熟果。你可能认识花朵，全面了解花根、花茎及其生长轨迹，但是，你却不能欣赏沾满天堂朝露的鲜花。我不耐烦地反复问自己：“为什么要在意这些解释和假设呢？”这些解释和假设在我头脑中飘来飘去，就像失明的鸟儿徒劳地扑打着翅膀。我并不是反对透彻地理解名著，只是反对冗长的评论和令人困惑的批评，因为那样只会教人明白一件事：仁者见仁，智者见智。然而，当基特里奇教授这样的大学者阐释大师作品时，则使人有“仿佛盲人得到新视觉”之感。他复原了诗人莎士比亚。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There are, however, times when I long to sweep away half the things I am expected to learn; for the overtaxed mind cannot enjoy the treasure it has secured at the greatest cost. It is impossible, I think, to read in one day four or five different books in different languages and treating of widely different subjects, and not lose sight of the very ends for which one reads. When one reads hurriedly and nervously, having in mind written tests and examinations, one's brain becomes encumbered with a lot of choice bric-a-brac for which there seems to be little use. At the present time my mind is so full of heterogeneous matter that I almost despair of ever being able to put it in order. Whenever I enter the region that was the kingdom of my mind I feel like the proverbial bull in the china shop. A thousand odds and ends of knowledge come crashing about my head like hailstones, and when I try to escape them, theme-goblins and college nixies of all sorts pursue me, until I wish -- oh, may I be forgiven the wicked wish!-- that I might smash the idols I came to worship.</div>

<div class="line_en">While my days at Radcliffe were still in the future, they were encircled with a halo of romance, which they have lost; but in the transition from romantic to actual I have learned many things I should never have known had I not tried the experiment. One of them is the precious science of patience, which teaches us that we should take our education as we would take a walk in the country, leisurely, our minds hospitably open to impressions of every sort. Such knowledge floods the soul unseen with a soundless tidal wave of deepening thought. "Knowledge is power." Rather, knowledge is happiness, because to have knowledge -- broad, deep knowledge -- is to know true ends from false, and lofty things from low. To know the thoughts and deeds that have marked man's progress is to feel the great heart-throbs of humanity through the centuries; and if one does not feel in these pulsations a heavenward striving, one must indeed be deaf to the harmonies of life.</div>
