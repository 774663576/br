<div class="line_en">Sophie rode back to the castle's Kingsbury entrance in one of the King's coaches, drawn by four horses. On it also were a coachman, a groom, and a footman. A sergeant and six Royal Troopers went with it to guard it. The reason was Princess Valeria. She had climbed into Sophie's lap.</div>

<div class="line_en">As the coach clattered the short way downhill, Sophie's dress was still covered with the wet marks of Valeria's royal approval. Sophie smiled a little. She thought Martha might have a point after all, wanting children, although ten Valerias struck her as a bit much. As Valeria had scrambled over her, Sophie remembered hearing that the Witch had threatened in some way, and she found herself saying to Valeria, "The Witch shan't hurt you. I won't let her!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="马车在短短的下山路上发出咕噜咕噜的声音，苏菲衣服上犹留有薇乐莉雅公主湿漉漉的口水痕迹，那是她喜爱的明证，苏菲忍不住要微笑起来。她终于了解玛莎的一些想法了，虽然十个小孩感觉上还是太多了些。当薇乐莉雅公主在她身上爬上爬下时，她想起女巫曾经对公主做出某种威胁，她忍不住跟薇乐莉雅说：“我绝不许那女巫动你一根汗毛！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The equipage drew to a very noisy halt outside the disguised stable. Michael shot out of the door and got in the way of the footman who was helping Sophie down. "Where did you get to?" he said. "I've been so worried! And Howl's terribly upset --"</div>

<div class="line_en">While Sophie described some of what had happened, Howl leaned on the mantelpiece, dangling the scroll as if he was thinking of feeding it to Calcifer. "Behold the new Royal Wizard," he said. "My name is very black." Then he began to laugh, much to the surprise of Sophie and Michael. "And what did she do to the Count of Catterack?" he laughed. "I should never have let her near the King!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当苏菲述说当天发生的一些事情时，哈尔靠着壁炉架，放任卷轴垂下来，好象在考虑要不要拿它来喂卡西法似的。“看呀，皇家巫师在此！”他说：“而且我的名声超烂！”然后出乎苏菲和麦可意料之外的，他突然大笑。“看她把那个卡特拉克男爵搞成什么样子？我根本不该让她接近国王的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“因为潘思德曼太太死了。”麦可说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Howl came to the door too. He looked pale and depressed. He was holding a scroll with red-and-blue royal seals dangling off it, which Sophie eyed guiltily. Howl gave the sergeant a gold piece and did not say a word until the coach and the Troopers had gone clattering away. Then he said, "I make that four horses and ten men just to get rid of one old woman. What did you do to the King?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈尔也来到门口，他看起来苍白且情绪低落。他手里拿着一个卷轴，上面盖有王室红蓝二色的印章，苏菲带着罪恶感看它。哈尔赏给那士官一个金币。一直到车子与车队辘辘地离开后都一言不发。然后他说：“为了摆脱一个老女人，居然要动用到四匹马和十个人！你对国王做了什么？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sophie followed Howl and Michael indoors, expecting to find the room covered with green slime. But it was not, and there was Calcifer flaring up the chimney, grinning his purple grin. Sophie sank into the chair. "I think the king got sick of me turning up and blackening your name. I went twice," she said. "Everything went wrong. And I met the Witch on her way from killing Mrs. Pentstemmon. What a day!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苏菲跟着哈尔和麦可进入屋里，她原以为会看到一屋子的绿色黏液，结果居然没有，卡西法高高地燃上烟囱，露出紫色的微笑。苏菲沉到椅子里：“我猜国王大概受不了我一直跟他破坏你的名声吧？我去了两次。”她叹道：“没有一件事顺利！还碰到刚杀死潘思德曼太太的女巫。什么日子嘛！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Howl had gone out very early, leaving the bathroom full of the usual scented steam. He had not taken his guitar, and the doorknob was turned to green-down. Even Calcifer knew no more than that. "Don't open the door to anyone,' Calcifer said. "The Witch knows about all our entrances except the Porthaven one."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈尔一早就出去了，浴室里仍残留着如常的充满香气的水蒸气。他没有带吉他，门柄则转到绿色向下。连卡西法也只知道这么多。“不管谁来都不能开门。”卡西法叮咛道：“除了避难港那一个之外，女巫知道所有的入口。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Michael was the one who worried about the Witch. He confessed next morning that he had had nightmares all night. He had dreamed she came through all the castle entrances at once. "Where's Howl?" he asked anxiously.</div>

<div class="line_en">The door bounced powerfully for a while. Then it stopped. Michael had just let go of Sophie in great relief when there came a violent explosion.

<div class="line_cn" title="门激烈地震动了一阵子后，停住了。麦可大大松了一口气，放开抓着苏菲的手。就在这时，传来一阵剧烈的爆炸，厚板应声哗啦啦地掉到底墒。卡西法躲到炉架的低部，麦可躲进放扫把的储物柜里，独留苏菲一人站在那里。门突然打开，哈尔冲了进来。">查看中文翻译</div>

Howl stepped out of it with his hair gleaming dry and his suit gray-and-scarlet and not even damp, and went to fetch the saucepan. "The world is full of hard-hearted women, Michael," he said. "I can name three without stopping to think."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那就算了。”哈尔说。他全身抖动，水流下来，在地板上形成一个圆圈。哈尔跨出来，头发已经干燥并发着光亮，衣服也恢复为灰色和红色。他走过去拿起炖锅，“麦可，世界上多的是硬心肠的女人，”他说：“我不用想就可以说出三个人名。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I don't think we need move the Porthaven entrance," Howl said. He conjured himself a handkerchief out of the air and blew his nose with a hoot which made Calcifer flicker uneasily. "But I want the moving castle well away from anywhere it's been before and the Kingsbury entrance shut down."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我想我们不需要移动避难港那扇门。”哈尔说着，由空中抓出一条手帕，用力地擤了一下鼻涕，令卡西法紧张地晃动起来。“但是我要这座移动的城堡远离它以前去过的地方，金斯别利的入口也要关掉。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Someone knocked on the door then. Sophie noticed that Howl jumped and looked round as nervously as Michael. Neither of them answered the door. Coward! Sophie thought scornfully. She wondered why she had gone through all that trouble for Howl yesterday. "I must have been mad!" she muttered to the blue-and-silver suit.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然有人敲门。苏菲注意到，哈尔跟麦可一样跳了起来，紧张地四处张望，两个人都不去应门。懦夫！苏菲心里偷骂，不知自己昨天为何要为哈尔的事那样费心。“我一定是疯了！”她跟手上正在缝的蓝银色衣服喃喃地说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">By the middle of the morning Howl was conjuring handkerchiefs in twos and threes. They were floppy squares of paper really, Sophie saw. He kept sneezing. His voice grew hoarser.

<div class="line_cn" title="早晨过一半时，哈尔变成一次要拿两、三条手帕了。事实上，苏菲看出它们不过是软趴趴的方型纸罢了。他打喷嚏打个不停，声音也越来越沙哑，再不久，手帕一拿就是半打了。卡西法旁边堆满了他用过的手帕灰烬。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh, how your ears flap and your long nose twitches!" Howl croaked. "I looked when he first disappeared, of course. I was curious to know what Prince Justin was doing up this way, when everyone knew Suliman had gone to the Waste. I think someone must have sold him a dud finding spell, because he went right over into the Folding Valley and bought another from Mrs. Fairfax.

<div class="line_en">"Yes, but I didn't mention the matter before," said Howl, "because the King might have thought you should have had the sense to sell him another dud. I had a conscience about it.

In the time it took Sophie to sew ten more blue triangles Michael ran upstairs with lemon and honey, with a particular book, with cough mixture, with a spoon to take the cough mixture with, and then with nose drops, throat pastilles, gargle, pen, paper, three more books, and an infusion of willow bark.

At last, the person who came out wearing the cloak was a burly man with a red beard. This person licked his fingers and said with Michael's voice, "Howl thinks I'll be safe enough like this.

<div class="line_en">Peace descended. Calcifer settled and chinked. Howl had evidently realized that Sophie was not going to run about after him. There was silence upstairs. Sophie got up and cautiously hobbled to the broom cupboard. This was her chance to go and see Lettie. Lettie must be very miserable by now. Sophie was fairly sure Howl had not been near her since that day in the orchard. It might just do some good if Sophie were to tell her that her feelings were caused by a charmed suit. Anyway, she owed it to Lettie to tell her.</div>

<div class="line_en">A huge, spindly greyhound leaped off the hillside between the grinding black blocks of the castle and landed in the middle of the room. Sophie dropped the cloak and backed away hurriedly. She had always been nervous of dogs, and greyhounds are not reassuring to look at. This one put itself between her and the door and stared at her. Sophie looked longingly at the wheeling rocks outside and wondered whether it would do any good to yell for Howl.</div>

<div class="line_en">The dog bent its already bent back and somehow hoisted itself onto its lean hind legs. That made it almost as tall as Sophie.

<div class="line_en">"Came from Upper Folding!" panted this dog-man. "Love Lettie -- Lettie sent me -- Lettie crying and very unhappy -- sent me to you -- told me to stay --" He began to double up and shrink before he had finished speaking. He gave a dog howl of despair and annoyance. "Don't tell Wizard!" he whined and dwindled away inside reddish curly hair into a dog again. A different dog. This time he seemed to be a red setter.
