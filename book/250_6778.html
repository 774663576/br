By this process he learned all about Flint Buckner, his character, conduct, and habits, that the people were able to tell him. It thus transpired that the Extraordinary Mans nephew was the only person in the camp who had a killing-grudge against Flint Buckner.

I take from it this article. It is a bit of silver-bearing quartz. It is peculiar. Examine it, please -- you -- and you -- and you. Now pass it back, please.

Taken with the corroborative evidence of the quartz, it reveals to us that the assassin was a miner. What does it tell us further?

<div class="line_en">"The assassin studied out his plan with a good deal of pains. It was a good plan, very ingenious, and showed an intelligent mind, not a feeble one. It was a plan which was well calculated to ward off all suspicion from its inventor. In the first place, he marked a candle into spaces an inch apart, and lit it and timed it. He found it took three hours to burn four inches of it. I tried it myself for half an hour, awhile ago, upstairs here, while the inquiry into Flint Buckner's character and ways was being conducted in this room, and I arrived in that way at the rate of a candles consumption when sheltered from the wind. Having proved his trial-candles rate, he blew it out -- I have already shown it to you -- and put his inch-marks on a fresh one."</div>

He placed it in that absolutely secure hiding-place, and in the bottom of it he set the candlestick. Then he measured off about thirty-five feet of fuse -- the barrels distance from the back of the cabin. He bored a hole in the side of the barrel -- here is the large gimlet he did it with. He went on and finished his work -- and when it was done, one end of the fuse was in Buckner's cabin, and the other end, with a notch chipped in it to expose the powder, was in the hole in the candle; timed to blow the place up at one o'clock this morning, provided the candle was lit about eight o'clock yesterday evening -- which I am betting it was -- and provided there was an explosive in the cabin and connected with that end of the fuse -- which I am also betting there was, though I cant prove it. Boys, the barrel is there in the chaparral, the candles remains are in it in the tin stick -- the burnt-out fuse is in the gimlet-hole, the other end is down the hill where the late cabin stood.

One of these propositions met with much favor; it was, to confer upon the assassin a vote of thanks for removing Flint Buckner, and let him go. But the cooler heads opposed it, pointing out that addled brains in the Eastern States would pronounce it a scandal, and make no end of foolish noise about it.
