<div class="line_en">On the bus ride home from the doctor, the strangest thing was happening to Mariam. Everywhere she looked, she saw bright colors: on the drab, gray concrete apartments, on the tin-roofed, open-fronted stores, in the muddy water flowing in the gutters. It was as though a rainbow had melted into her eyes.</div>

<div class="line_en">On the streets, Mariam saw people stopping in their tracks. At traffic lights, faces emerged from the windows of cars, turned upward toward the falling softness. What was it about a season's first snowfall, Mariam wondered, that was so entrancing? Was it the chance to see something as yet unsoiled, untrodden? To catch the fleeting grace of a new season, a lovely beginning, before it was trampled and corrupted?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽雅姆看到马路上的行人纷纷停了下来。在交通灯之下，人们的脸庞从轿车的车窗中露出来，转向上方，迎着那一片飘落的柔软。玛丽雅姆心想，这个季节的第一场雪怎能如此迷人呢？是因为它让人有机会看到一些依然洁白无瑕、未受糟蹋的东西吗？抑或是它让人在积雪被践踏、变黑之前，能够感受到新季节稍纵即逝的优雅，感受到一个全新的开始？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">MARIAM AWOKE the next morning to the sound of sawing and hammering. She wrapped a shawl around her and went out into the snow-blown yard. The heavy snowfall of the previous night had stopped. Now only a scattering of light, swirling flakes tickled her cheeks. The air was windless and smelled like burning coal. Kabul was eerily silent, quilted in white, tendrils of smoke snaking up here and there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天早晨，玛丽雅姆被锯子和铁锤的声音吵醒。她裹上披肩，走进雪花飞舞的院子。昨晚的鹅毛大雪已经停了。这时只有零散的细小雪花飘落在她脸庞上。空气很沉闷，弥漫着木炭燃烧的味道。喀布尔银装素裹，寂静无声，几缕零落的炊烟袅袅升起。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mariam wished he wouldn't do that, hitch his hopes to its being a boy. As happy as she was about this pregnancy, his expectation weighed on her. Yesterday, Rasheed had gone out and come home with a suede winter coat for a boy, lined inside with soft sheepskin, the sleeves embroidered with fine red and yellow silk thread.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽雅姆希望他别这样，板上钉钉地认为肚子里的胎儿是个男婴。怀上了孩子虽然让她很高兴，但他的期望却令她不堪重负。昨天，拉希德跑出去了，回来的时候拿着一件男孩穿的羊皮冬大衣，大衣里面缝着柔软的绵羊皮，衣袖上还有用很好的红色、黄色丝线绣成的图案。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">THE NEXT MORNING, Rasheed said he wanted to invite his friends for dinner to celebrate. All morning, Mariam cleaned lentils and moistened rice. She sliced eggplants for borani, and cooked leeks and ground beef for aushak. She swept the floor, beat the curtains, aired the house, despite the snow that had started up again. She arranged mattresses and cushions along the walls of the living room, placed bowls of candy and roasted almonds on the table.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="隔日早上，拉希德说他打算请几个朋友过来吃顿晚饭，庆祝一下。玛丽雅姆一整个早上都在洗小扁豆和淘米。她切开茄子，准备做凉拌茄子；还做了韭菜牛肉饼。她拖了地板，拍打了窗帘，不顾外面的大雪又开始落下，打开窗让房间透气。她沿着客厅的墙边，摆放了一些床垫和坐垫，在桌子上摆了几碗糖果和烤杏仁。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She was in her room by early evening before the first of the men arrived. She lay in bed as the hoots and laughter and bantering voices downstairs began to mushroom. She couldn't keep her hands from drifting to her belly. She thought of what was growing there, and happiness rushed in like a gust of wind blowing a door wide open. Her eyes watered.</div>

<div class="line_en">Rasheed lifted a long, narrow board. As he began to saw it in half, he said the stairs worried him. "Something will have to be done about them later, when he's old enough to climb." The stove worried him too, he said. The knives and forks would have to be stowed somewhere out of reach.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mariam thought of her six-hundred-and-fifty-kilometer bus trip with Rasheed, from Herat in the west, near the border with Iran, to Kabul in the east. They had passed small towns and big towns, and knots of little villages that kept springing up one after another. They had gone over mountains and across raw-burned deserts, from one province to the next. And here she was now, over those boulders and parched hills, with a home of her own, a husband of her own, heading toward one final, cherished province: Motherhood. How delectable it was to think of this baby, her baby, their baby. How glorious it was to know that her love for it already dwarfed anything she had ever felt as a human being, to know that there was no need any longer for pebble games.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽雅姆想起了她那段六百五十公里的客车之旅，和拉希德在一起，自西方的赫拉特，临近和伊朗交界的国境线的地方，来到东边的喀布尔。他们沿途经过一些小城镇和大城市，一座又一座的小村落彼此相连，此起彼伏地出现。而如今，她在这里，越过那些岩石和贫瘠的山脉，拥有属于她自己的家，属于她自己的丈夫，向着一个宝贵的终点站出发：成为母亲。想到这个婴儿，她的婴儿，他们的婴儿，她快乐得无法形容。知道自己对它的爱已经使她有生以来拥有过的任何东西相形失色，知道她再也不需要玩那卵石游戏了，她光荣得容光焕发。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When Mariam thought of this baby, her heart swelled inside of her. It swelled and swelled until all the loss, all the grief, all the loneliness and self-abasement of her life washed away. This was why God had brought her here, all the way across the country. She knew this now. She remembered a verse from the Koran that Mullah Faizullah had taught her: And Allah is the East and the West, therefore wherever you turn there is Allah's purpose… She laid down her prayer rug and did namaz. When she was done, she cupped her hands before her face and asked God not to let all this good fortune slip away from her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每当玛丽雅姆想到这个孩子，她的心就会膨胀起来。它膨胀，再膨胀，直到她生命中所有的失落，所有的悲哀，所有的孤独，所有的自责统统都消失无踪。这就是真主让她跨越千山万水，来到这里的原因。现在她知道这个原因了。她记得法苏拉赫毛拉曾经教给她一句《古兰经》的诗句：真主既在东边，也在西边，无论转向何方，你们都能领略到真主的旨意……她铺好祷告用的毛毯，做起晚祷。完了之后，她双手在面前合十，恳求真主别让这好运从她身边溜走。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the women's hamam, shapes moved about in the steam around Mariam, a glimpse of a hip here, the contour of a shoulder there. The squeals of young girls, the grunts of old women, and the trickling of bathwater echoed between the walls as backs were scrubbed and hair soaped. Mariam sat in the far corner by herself, working on her heels with a pumice stone, insulated by a wall of steam from the passing shapes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽雅姆在女性浴室里面，几个身形在她身边的蒸汽中走来走去，她不是瞥见一个屁股，就是看到一个肩膀的轮廓。女孩子的尖叫声，老太婆的哼哼声，还有洗澡水流动的声音在墙壁之间回荡着；这些女人就在这片声音之中擦着后背，用香皂洗着头发。玛丽雅姆独自坐在偏僻的角落，用一块浮石擦洗自己的脚跟，一道水帘将她和过往的身形隔开。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">ANOTHER BUS RIDE with Rasheed. Snowing again. Falling thick this time. It was piling in heaps on sidewalks, on roofs, gathering in patches on the bark of straggly trees. Mariam watched the merchants plowing snow from their storefronts. A group of boys was chasing a black dog. They waved sportively at the bus. Mariam looked over to Rasheed. His eyes were closed. He wasn't humming. Mariam reclined her head and closed her eyes too. She wanted out of her cold socks, out of the damp wool sweater that was prickly against her skin. She wanted away from this bus.</div>
