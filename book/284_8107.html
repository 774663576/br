<div class="line_en">But when Colin held forth under his tree old Ben fixed devouring eyes on him and kept them there. He looked him over with critical affection. It was not so much the lecture which interested him as the legs which looked straighter and stronger each day, the boyish head which held itself up so well, the once sharp chin and hollow cheeks which had filled and rounded out and the eyes which had begun to hold the light he remembered in another pair. Sometimes when Colin felt Ben's earnest gaze meant he was much impressed he wondered what he was reflecting on and once when he had seemed quite entranced he questioned him.</div>

<div class="line_en">That morning Dickon was too late to hear the lecture. When he came he was ruddy with running and his funny face looked more twinkling than usual. As they had a good deal of weeding to do after the rains they fell to work. They always had plenty to do after a warm deep sinking rain. The moisture which was good for the flowers was also good for the weeds which thrust up tiny blades of grass and points of leaves which must be pulled up before their roots took too firm hold. Colin was as good at weeding as any one in these days and he could lecture while he was doing it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天早晨迪肯来得太晚了，错过讲座。他来的时候，因为跑步脸色红润，喜气的脸蛋显得比平时更熠熠生辉。雨后他们有很多除草的活儿，于是他们一头扎进工作。一场温暖深透的雨水之后，他们总是有很多活儿。滋润对花儿好，对杂草也好，杂草刺出微小的条条草片、点点叶片，必须趁根抓牢之前拔起来。这些天来，柯林草除得和任何人一样好，他可以一边除草，一边讲座。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The Magic works best when you work, yourself," he said this morning. "You can feel it in your bones and muscles. I am going to read books about bones and muscles, but I am going to write a book about Magic. I am making it up now. I keep finding out things."</div>

<div class="line_en">It was not very long after he had said this that he laid down his trowel and stood up on his feet. He had been silent for several minutes and they had seen that he was thinking out lectures, as he often did. When he dropped his trowel and stood upright it seemed to Mary and Dickon as if a sudden strong thought had made him do it. He stretched himself out to his tallest height and he threw out his arms exultantly. Color glowed in his face and his strange eyes widened with joyfulness. All at once he had realized something to the full.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他这么说了不久以后，就放下泥刀，站起来。他刚刚沉默了几分钟，他们看出来他在设计讲座，就像（因为）他经常那样。当他放下泥刀笔直站起来，玛丽和迪肯似乎看出一个突发的强烈念头让他这么做。他把自己伸展到最高点，狂喜地甩出手臂。柯林的脸熠熠生光，奇怪的眼睛因欢乐而大大睁开。突然之间，他完完全全明白了什么。">查看中文翻译</div>

She had wonderful affectionate eyes which seemed to take everything in -- all of them, even Ben Weatherstaff and the "creatures" and every flower that was in bloom.

<div class="line_en">Susan Sowerby went round their garden with them and was told the whole story of it and shown every bush and tree which had come alive. Colin walked on one side of her and Mary on the other. Each of them kept looking up at her comfortable rosy face, secretly curious about the delightful feeling she gave them -- a sort of warm, supported feeling. It seemed as if she understood them as Dickon understood his "creatures." She stooped over the flowers and talked about them as if they were children. Soot followed her and once or twice cawed at her and flew upon her shoulder as if it were Dickon's. When they told her about the robin and the first flight of the young ones she laughed a motherly little mellow laugh in her throat.</div>

<div class="line_en">She had packed a basket which held a regular feast this morning, and when the hungry hour came and Dickon brought it out from its hiding place, she sat down with them under their tree and watched them devour their food, laughing and quite gloating over their appetites. She was full of fun and made them laugh at all sorts of odd things. She told them stories in broad Yorkshire and taught them new words. She laughed as if she could not help it when they told her of the increasing difficulty there was in pretending that Colin was still a fretful invalid.</div>
