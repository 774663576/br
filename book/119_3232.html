<div class="line_en">When he heard the Shakeforest Towers clock strike eleven, he saw the third figure appear. As the man came towards the hut, the moonlight shone full on his face, and the boy realized in horror that it was the Duke. All the villagers lived in fear of the Duke. He owned every farm and every house for miles around, and anybody who made him angry could lose their home and their job in a moment. The boy closed the stove, and quickly hid himself in a corner of the hut.</div>

<div class="line_en">The next evening the old shepherd left the boy alone in the hut again, with repeated orders to keep a careful eye on the sheep. But young Bill was only interested in the view from the south window. He watched and waited, while the moonlight shone on the ancient stones, but neither Captain nor Duchess appeared.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天晚上，老牧羊人又把男孩独自留在了小屋里，反复嘱咐他好好照看羊群。但小比尔却只对南面窗外的情景感兴趣。月光照耀在古老的石头上，他一边观望一边等待，但上尉和公爵夫人都没有出现。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Duke came close to the place where his wife and the Captain had stood the night before. He looked around, perhaps for a hiding-place. When he discovered the hut among the trees, he entered, and stood at the south window, looking out at the Devil's Door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="公爵走近昨晚他妻子和上尉待过的地方，环顾四周，看样子是在寻找一个藏身之所。他发现了树林中的小木屋，随即走了进去，站在南面的窗户前朝“魔鬼之门”望去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Only a minute or two later the Captain arrived, to wait for the Duchess. But a terrible surprise was waiting for him tonight, as well as for the frightened boy hidden in the hut. At the Captain's appearance, the Duke became very angry. He opened the door of the hut and stepped out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="只过了一两分钟，上尉就来等候公爵夫人了。然而，今晚有一个可怕的意外正等待着他，也等待着藏在小屋里的这个吓坏了的孩子。上尉一出现，公爵立刻勃然大怒。他打开小屋的门走了出去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You have dishonoured her, and for that you shall die!" he cried. In the hut, the boy left his hiding-place and ran to the window. He could not see the two men, but he heard something falling on the grass, and then silence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你败坏了她的清誉，为此该受一死！”他大叫道。小木屋里的男孩从藏身之处跑到了窗边。他看不见那两个人，但却听见了有东西摔落到草地上的声音，接下来是一片死寂。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Now for the second!" the boy heard him say. This time the Duke waited outside the hut. It was clear that he expected his wife, the Duchess, to arrive next at the meeting-place.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“现在该轮到第二个了！”男孩听见他在喃喃自语。这一次，公爵在木屋外等待着。他显然是在等他的妻子公爵夫人来到这个幽会的地方。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Three minutes later he saw the Duke going up the hill towards the stones, pulling the Captain's body along the ground. The boy knew that behind the Devil's Door there was a deep hole, covered by long grass and other plants. The Duke made his way slowly to the shadows behind the stones, and when he came out, he was pulling nothing behind him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="3分钟后，他看见公爵拖着上尉的尸体朝山上的石头走去。男孩知道“魔鬼之门”背后有一个很深的洞，洞口覆盖着茂密的草和其他植物。公爵慢慢走进巨石后面的阴影，当他出来时，身后什么都没有了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The jealous watcher waited for some time, but she never came. Sometimes he looked at his watch in surprise. He seemed almost disappointed that she did not appear. At half-past eleven he turned away to find his horse, and rode slowly down the hill.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这位妒火中烧的守望者等了一会儿，她却一直没有来。他不时惊诧地看看手表。看来她不曾露面倒让他几乎有些失望了。11点半时，他转过身找到自己的马，慢慢朝山下骑去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Inside the hut young Bill shook with fear. "What will he do if she comes?" he thought. "Will he kill her too? He looks angry enough! And he can do what he likes -- he's the Duke. Nobody can stop him!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="木屋里，小比尔吓得浑身颤抖。“如果她来了，他会怎么做？”他想，“他会把她也杀掉吗？他看样子快气炸了！而且他做事完全可以随心所欲——他是公爵，没有人能阻止他！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When the Duke got close to the great house, a small door in a side wall opened, and a woman came out. She ran into the moonlight to meet the Duke.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="公爵走近这座大房子时，边墙上的一扇小门打开了，有个女人走了出来。她跑到月光下迎接公爵。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The young boy thought of what lay in the hole behind the stones, and was too frightened to stay alone in the hut. He preferred to be with someone who was alive, even the Duke, than with someone who was dead, so he ran after the horseman. He followed the Duke all the way down into the valley, feeling more comfortable when the lonely hills were left behind him. Soon he could see the high walls and roofs of the Duke's home, Shakeforest Towers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小男孩想象着石头后面的山洞中可能躺着的东西，吓得不敢独自留在小屋中。他宁愿和任何一个活人在一起，哪怕是公爵也好，总强过和死人待在一起。于是他跟在骑马的公爵身后跑去。他一路跟着公爵下山，当孤寂的群山被远远甩在身后时，他感觉舒服多了。很快，他就看到了公爵的家——舍克弗洛斯特城堡那高高的围墙和屋顶。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh, then it was your sister -- yes, I told her about it. Well, I haven't seen him for many years, and of course I'd forgotten all about his feeling for me. So I was surprised to receive a letter from him yesterday. I can remember what he wrote."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，那就是你妹妹——没错，我曾经跟她讲过。嗯，我已经好多年没见过他了，当然也已经忘记了他对我的感情。所以昨天收到他的信时，我非常惊讶。我还记得他都写了些什么。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"That was his letter. Now I realize that it was a mistake to go, but at the time I only thought he must be in trouble, and with not a friend in the world to help him. So I went to Marlbury Downs at eleven o'clock. Wasn't it brave of me?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"When I got there, I saw he was no longer the boy that I remembered, but a full-grown man and an officer. I was sorry I had come. What he wanted, I don't know -- perhaps just a meeting with me. He held me by the hand and waist, and refused to let me go until I promised to meet him again. And in the end I did, because he spoke very warmly to me and I was afraid of him in that lonely place. Then I escaped -- I ran home -- and that's all. Of course, I never meant to meet him there again. But this evening I thought, 'Perhaps he'll come to the house when he realizes I'm not coming to meet him,' and that's why I couldn't sleep. But you are so silent!"</div>
