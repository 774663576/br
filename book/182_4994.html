<div class="line_en">"And so," said Trumpkin (for, as you have realized, it was he who had been telling all this story to the four children, sitting on the grass in the ruined hall of Cair Paravel) -- "and so I put a crust or two in my pocket, left behind all weapons but my dagger, and took to the woods in the grey of the morning. I'd been plugging away for many hours when there came a sound that I'd never heard the like of in my born days. Eh, I won't forget that. The whole air was full of it, loud as thunder but far longer, cool and sweet as music over water, but strong enough to shake the woods. And I said to myself, `If that's not the Horn, call me a rabbit.' And a moment later I wondered why he hadn't blown it sooner --"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, as I was saying, I wondered, but I went on as hard as I could pelt. I kept on all night -- and then, when it was half light this morning, as if I'd no more sense than a Giant, I risked a short cut across open country to cut off a big loop of the river, and was caught. Not by the army, but by a pompous old fool who has charge of a little castle which is Miraz's last stronghold towards the coast. I needn't tell you they got no true tale out of me, but I was a Dwarf and that was enough. But, lobsters and lollipops! it is a good thing the seneschal was a pompous fool. Anyone else would have run me through there and then. But nothing would do for him short of a grand execution: sending me down `to the ghosts in the full ceremonial way. And then this young lady", (he nodded at Susan) "does her bit of archery and it was pretty shooting, let me tell you -- and here we are. And without my armour, for of course they took that." He knocked out and refilled his pipe.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，听到号声，我立即感到信心倍增，便继续奋力向前走，整整走了一天一夜。后来，在破晓时分，我做了件蠢事——我为了不去绕那条河道，冒险抄近路穿过一片开阔地，结果被他们捉住了。抓住我的不是军队，而是一个高傲的老傻瓜。他驻守在一个小城堡里面，那是弥若兹在通往海岸的路上设下的最后一个关卡。我不必表白自己，但他们的确从我嘴里一句实话也没有得到。可是，我是个小矮人，这已经足够给我判罪了。哈，感谢上帝！那个管事儿的老傻瓜真不错，换了别人一定当场就把我干掉了。可是，他认为只有把我送到‘鬼’那儿去，才是最解恨的惩罚。结果，承蒙这位年轻的小姐救了我（他冲苏珊点了点头）。遗憾的是我身上的盔甲都没有了，被他们拿走了。”他磕一磕手里的烟斗，又装上一斗烟。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes," said Peter, "I suppose what makes it feel so queer is that in the stories it's always someone in our world who does the calling. One doesn't really think about where the Jinn's coming from."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不错，”彼得说，“奇怪的是故事里喊‘魔鬼快来’的总是我们世界里的什么人，谁也没有认真想过，‘魔鬼’究竟是从哪儿来的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don't know why you shouldn't believe it," said Lucy, "if you believe in magic at all. Aren't there lots of stories about magic forcing people out of one place -- out of one world -- into another? I mean, when a magician in The Arabian Nights calls up a Jinn, it has to come. We had to come, just like that."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不相信？为什么不相信。”露茜说，“好多故事都讲到，魔力能使人们离开某一个地方，或者离开某一个世界，到另一个世界去。比方说，《一千零一夜》故事中的法师一念秘诀，魔鬼马上便会出现在他的面前。我们突然回到纳尼亚，也正是这个原因。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And now we know what it feels like for the Jinn," said Edmund with a chuckle. "Golly! It's a bit uncomfortable to know that we can be whistled for like that. It's worse than what Father says about living at the mercy of the telephone."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“现在我们知道了，这和‘魔鬼快来’是同一道理。”爱德蒙笑了起来，“天啊！拿起号角就那么一吹，我们便不由自主地被呼来唤去，这真让人觉得有点儿不自在。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I suppose you are the four children out of the old stories," said Trumpkin. "And I'm very glad to meet you of course. And it's very interesting, no doubt. But -- no offence?' -- and he hesitated again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我猜你们一定是古老传说中的四个孩子，”杜鲁普金说，“当然，我很高兴见到你们。当然这也是很有意思的事。可是……你们不生气吧？”——他又犹豫起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, then -- no offence," said Trumpkin. "But, you know, the King and Trufflehunter and Doctor Cornelius were expecting -- well, if you see what I mean, help. To put it in another way, I think they'd been imagining you as great warriors. As it is -- we're awfully fond of children and all that, but just at the moment, in the middle of a war but I'm sure you understand."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，那么……你们可别生气啊，”杜鲁普金不安地说，“你们知道，国王、特鲁佛汉特和克奈尔斯博士都在期待……嗯，你们知道我指的是什么——他们在期待着强有力的帮助，换句话说，我想他们一直把你们想象成高大健壮、能征善战的勇士。可是，你们都是些孩子，在这样的时刻，在战斗中……你们又能干什么呢？我相信你们是能理解的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I don't quite see the point --" began Edmund, but Lucy whispered in his ear, "Hadn't we better do what Peter says? He is the High King, you know. And I think he has an idea." So Edmund agreed and by the aid of his torch they all, including Trumpkin, went down the steps again into the dark coldness and dusty splendour of the treasure house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是不是先商量一下……”爱德蒙没有动。可是露茜在他耳边悄悄地说，“咱们先按彼得说的去做。你知道，他是咱们的首领。我想他心中有数。”爱德蒙点点头，拿起手电筒，领着大家，包括杜鲁普金，又一次沿着台阶来到那漆黑寒冷而又布满灰尘的宝库。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Little from you is really a bit too much," said Edmund, jumping up. "I suppose you don't believe we won the Battle of Beruna? Well, you can say what you like about me because I know --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“‘小朋友’！这，这简直太小看我们了！”爱德蒙跳了起来，“我想你不会相信是我们打赢了柏卢纳战役的吧？好吧，你想说什么就说什么好啦，我知道……”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There's no good losing our tempers," said Peter. "Let's fit him out with fresh armour and fit ourselves out from the treasure chamber, and have a talk after that."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“现在发脾气有什么用？”彼得打断了他的话，“咱们先给他配备一套盔甲，我们也必须立刻武装起来，别的话以后再说。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Dwarf's eyes glistened as he saw the wealth that lay on the shelves (though he had to stand on tiptoes to do so) and he muttered to himself, "It would never do to let Nikabrik see this; never." They found easily enough a mail shirt for him, a sword, a helmet, a shield, a bow and quiverful of arrows, all of dwarfish size. The helmet was of copper, set with rubies, and there was gold on the hilt of the sword: Trumpkin had never seen, much less carried, so much wealth in all his life. The children also put on mail shirts and helmets; a sword and shield were found for Edmund and a bow for Lucy -- Peter and Susan were of course already carrying their gifts. As they came back up the stairway, jingling in their mail, and already looking and feeling more like Narnians and less like schoolchildren, the two boys were behind, apparently making some plan. Lucy heard Edmund say, "No, let me do it. It will be more of a sucks for him if I win, and less of a let-down for us all if I fail."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看到架子上那些宝贝，小矮人的眼睛直放光（尽管他只有踮起脚尖才能看得到），嘴里喃喃自语道：“千万可别让尼克布瑞克看到这些，千万！”孩子们很快就为他找到了一套合身的锁子甲、一顶头盔、一把宝剑、一块盾牌、一张弓和满满的一壶箭，这些都是专为小矮人们制造的，不仅大小合适，而且做工精良，材料也属上乘。那头盔是铜制的，镶嵌着宝石，剑柄则是纯金铸成。杜鲁普金一辈子没见过，更不曾拥有过这么贵重的东西，一时高兴得不知说什么才好。孩子们也穿上了盔甲。爱德蒙挑选了一柄锋利的宝剑，一块皮制的、灵巧的盾牌；露茜挑选了一张弓；彼得和苏珊早已佩挂好了他们各自的宝物。当他们顺着台阶走出宝库时，身上的锁子甲丁丁当当地响着，看上去全然是纳尼亚的勇士，再不是只知道读书玩耍的小学生了。两个男孩走在后面，很快就制定出一套行动方案。露茜听爱德蒙说：“不，让我来，要是我胜了，他的失败显得更惨。万一我输了，我们也不至于太丢脸。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I know," said Edmund. "But I'll never get anywhere near you and you'll be quite clever enough to disarm me without doing me any damage."</div>

<div class="line_en">When they came out into the daylight Edmund turned to the Dwarf very politely and said, "I've got something to ask you. Kids like us don't often have the chance of meeting a great warrior like you. Would you have a little fencing match with me? It would be frightfully decent."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们重新回到阳光下。这时，爱德蒙彬彬有礼地把身子转向小矮人，对他说：“我有个请求，希望你不要拒绝。你知道，我们这样的小朋友并不常有机会遇到你这样伟大的勇士，你愿意和我比试比试剑术吗？这样才合乎礼仪。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"All right, Ed," said Peter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那么好吧，爱德。”彼得答道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But, lad," said Trumpkin, "these swords are sharp."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可是，年轻人，”杜鲁普金说，“这些宝剑都很锋利，碰在身上可不是闹着玩的！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's a dangerous game," said Trumpkin. "But since you make such a point of it, I'll try a pass or two."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这可是个危险的游戏，”杜鲁普金说，“既然你已经提出来了，我就陪你一两个回合吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Both swords were out in a moment and the three others jumped off the dais and stood watching. It was well worth it. It was not like the silly fighting you see with broad swords on the stage. It was not even like the rapier fighting which you sometimes see rather better done. This was real broad-sword fighting. The great thing is to slash at your enemy's legs and feet because they are the part that have no armour. And when he slashes at yours you jump with both feet off the ground so that his blow goes under them. This gave the Dwarf an advantage because Edmund, being much taller, had to be always stooping. I don't think Edmund would have had a chance if he had fought Trumpkin twenty-four hours earlier. But the air of Narnia had been working upon him ever since they arrived on the island, and all his old battles came back to him, and his arms and fingers remembered their old skill. He was King Edmund once more. Round and round the two combatants circled, stroke after stroke they gave, and Susan (who never could learn to like this sort of thing) shouted out, "Oh, do be careful." And then, so quickly that no one (unless they knew, as Peter did) could quite see how it happened, Edmund flashed his sword round with a peculiar twist, the Dwarf's sword flew out of his grip, and Trumpkin was wringing his empty hand as you do after a "sting" from a cricket-bat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="霎时间，两把宝剑都抽了出来，另外三个孩子一齐跳下台来，站在一旁观战。这是一场真刀真枪的较量，绝不像戏台上用木头道具打给人看的花架子，甚至运动会上的击剑比赛也无法与之相比。这是战士间的格斗。最精彩的就是用宝剑去劈对方的腿和脚，因为这部分没有盔甲防护。当对方用剑劈来的一刹那，你就必须迅速跳起来，他这一击便从你脚下一掠而过。这当然对小矮人有利，因为爱德蒙个子高得多，只好不时地蹲下身子进攻对手。如果是在二十四小时以前和杜鲁普金比赛，爱德蒙就很难获胜了。可自从他们来到小岛上之后，纳尼亚的一切对他起了潜移默化的作用，使他回想起从前的战斗，他的胳膊和手指也恢复了从前的力量和技艺。他现在又是当年的国王爱德蒙了。两个斗士打了几个回合，苏珊（她怎么也没法喜欢这种事情）不停地高声喊着“噢！千万当心！”突然，爱德蒙翻腕使了一个花剑，把小矮人的剑打飞了。只见杜鲁普金望着那只空空的右手，不知所措地眨着眼睛。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“哈，你真会开玩笑，你！”小矮人说，“从她今天早上救了我以后，我就知道她的箭术有多高明了。不过，那也没关系，我可以试一试。”他装出不高兴的样子，但眼睛里却发出欣慰的光来，因为他开始意识到自己的阵营里来了不可小看的生力军。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That's quite true," put in Peter. "The best swordsman in the world may be disarmed by a trick that's new to him. I think it's only fair to give Trumpkin a chance at something else. Will you have a shooting match with my sister? There are no tricks in archery, you know."</div>

<div class="line_en">The Dwarf's face fell. "Looks more like a cherry than an apple," he muttered, but he said nothing out loud.</div>

<div class="line_en">Twang went the string. It was an excellent shot. The tiny apple shook as the arrow passed, and a leaf came fluttering down. Then Susan went to the top of the steps and strung her bow. She was not enjoying her match half so much as Edmund had enjoyed his; not because she had any doubt about hitting the apple but because Susan was so tenderhearted that she almost hated to beat someone who had been beaten already. The Dwarf watched her keenly as she drew the shaft to her ear. A moment later, with a little soft thump which they could all hear in that quiet place, the apple fell to the grass with Susan's arrow in it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="只听嗖的一声，箭射出去了。这一箭射得很漂亮。箭到之处，小苹果摆了一摆，旁边的一片树叶飘然而落。下面轮到苏珊。她走到台阶上，拉开了弓。她对这场比赛并不感兴趣，这倒不是因为她对射中那只苹果没有信心，而是因为她心地善良，不愿意再去伤害一颗已经受到伤害的心。小矮人仔细观察着她如何把箭杆拉向耳边。刹那间，一声轻响，那苹果掉落在草地上，苏珊的箭插在正中间。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They tossed up for first shot (greatly to the interest of Trumpkin, who had never seen a coin tossed before) and Susan lost.

<div class="line_en">"It's not a sight for little girls," began Trumpkin, but then he suddenly checked himself. "There I go talking like a fool again," he said "I suppose you're as likely to be a great surgeon as your brother was to be a great swordsman or your sister to be a great archer." He sat down on the steps and took off his hauberk and slipped down his little shirt, showing an arm hairy and muscular (in proportion) as a sailor's though not much bigger than a child's. There was a clumsy bandage on the shoulder which Lucy proceeded to unroll. Underneath, the cut looked very nasty and there was a good deal of swelling. "Oh, poor Trumpkin," said Lucy. "How horrid." Then she carefully dripped on to it one single drop of the cordial from her flask.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“小姑娘，你看也没用。”杜鲁普金话一出口，立刻感到不妥当，赶紧检讨说，“对不起，我又像个傻瓜一样讲话了。你的哥哥是一名出色的击剑家，你的姐姐是一名了不起的射手，我猜你可能是位伟大的医生。”他坐在台阶上，解开身上的锁子甲，脱掉贴身的小衬衫，露出那水手一般多毛而又肌肉发达的胳膊。他肩膀上有一块包扎得十分马虎的绷带。解开一看，只见绷带下面有一条很深的刀伤，伤口已经发炎了，周围红肿得很厉害。“啧啧，可怜的杜鲁普金，”露茜同情地说，“太吓人了。”说着，她细心地从手中的小瓶里倒出一滴神水，滴在那伤口上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Hullo. Eh? What have you done?" said Trumpkin. But however he turned his head and squinted and whisked his beard to and fro, he couldn't quite see his own shoulder. Then he felt it as well as he could, getting his arms and fingers into very difficult positions as you do when you're trying to scratch a place that is just out of reach. Then he swung his arm and raised it and tried the muscles, and finally jumped to his feet crying, "Giants and junipers! It's cured! It's as good as new." After that he burst into a great laugh and said, "Well, I've made as big a fool of myself as ever a Dwarf did. No offence, I hope? My humble duty to your Majesties all -- humble duty. And thanks for my life, my cure, my breakfast -- and my lesson."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“喂，你干什么呢？”杜鲁普金说。可当他转过头来，不由得大吃一惊，“咦，我的伤怎么没了？”只见他摆动着小胡子，斜着眼看来看去，然后又把那条胳膊上上下下摸了个遍。最后，他舒展几下胳膊，活动活动肌肉，跳起来大声叫道：“嗨！伤口治好喽！我的胳膊像新的一样！”接着他大笑起来，说：“唉！我怎么这么蠢，真是有眼不识泰山！你们都别生我的气，我向各位陛下致敬——虽然是微不足道的敬意。感谢你们救了我的命，治好了我的伤，以及那丰盛的早餐——还有使我了解了你们。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They used one of the raincoats as a kind of bag and put a good many apples in it.

The children were sorry to leave Cair Paravel, which, even in ruins, had begun to feel like home again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们用一件雨衣做成一只袋子，装了不少苹果，又一齐来到井边喝足了水，因为在到达清水湾之前很可能再也找不到淡水了。然后，大家登上小船，望着将要离开的凯尔帕拉维尔，孩子们心里不禁一阵惆怅。尽管那儿已成为一堆废墟，可他们还是觉得十分亲切，仿佛那就是他们的第二故乡。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"As I was saying," continued Edmund, "we needn't go that way. Why shouldn't we row a little south till we come to Glasswater Creek and row up it? That brings us up behind the Hill of the Stone Table, and we'll be safe while we're at sea. If we start at once, we can be at the head of Glasswater before dark, get a few hours' sleep, and be with Caspian pretty early tomorrow."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我刚才是想说，”爱德蒙继续说，“咱们不必走那条道，我们可以乘船向南，先到清水湾，然后逆流而上，这么走可直达大石桌的后山。我们在水上会比较安全一些。要是马上出发，在天黑之前就可以到达清水湾的入口，然后睡几个小时，明天一大早就可以和凯斯宾见面了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And soon the green, wooded coast of the island was falling away behind them, and its little bays and headlands were beginning to look flatter, and the boat was rising and falling in the gentle swell. The sea began to grow bigger around them and, in the distance, bluer, but close round the boat it was green and bubbly. Everything smelled salt and there was no noise except the swishing of water and the clop-clop of water against the sides and the splash of the oars and the jolting noise of the rowlocks. The sun grew hot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不久，那被密林覆盖的绿色小岛就被他们远远地抛在了身后，小船随着海浪上下颠簸着。周围的海域越来越辽阔，向远处望去，蓝蓝的海水一望无边，近处是小船荡起的碧绿的波浪，浪花在船边翻滚。空气中充满了海水的咸味。海上安静极了，只听到海水撞击船舷和船桨拍打水面的哗哗声，以及桨架发出的嘎吱声。天气开始热了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The D. L. F. had better steer," said Peter, "and Ed and I will take an oar each. Half a moment, though.

<div class="line_cn" title="“DLF，你来掌舵，”彼得说，“我和爱德蒙划桨。虽然路不远，咱们最好还是脱掉这身锁子甲，免得划不了多久，就热得受不了。你们两个女孩子坐在船首，给DLF指示方向，因为他不知道路。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was delightful for Lucy and Susan in the bows, bending over the edge and trying to get their hands in the sea which they could never quite reach. The bottom, mostly pure, pale sand but with occasional patches of purple seaweed, could be seen beneath them.</div>
