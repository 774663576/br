<div class="line_en">Then, instead of starting on the pile of dossiers in front of him, he opened a drawer in his desk, released a secret spring and took out a bundle of personal papers, precious manuscripts which he had put in order and labelled, with figures known only to him, the names of all those who had become his enemies -- whether in his political career, his business dealings, his legal practice or his secret love affairs.</div>

<div class="line_en">A mournful scene had just taken place in M. de Villefort's house. After the departure of the two ladies for the ball, all Mme de Villefort's efforts having failed definitely to persuade her husband to accompany her, the crown prosecutor had shut himself up as usual in his study with a pile of dossiers which would have terrified another man but which, in normal circumstances, would hardly have been enough to satisfy his mania for work.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="维尔福先生的家里的确发生了一幕悲哀的场面。太太和小姐已经去参加跳舞会去了，维尔福夫人虽曾竭力劝她的丈夫和她们同去，但她的请求没有成功，检察官还是照常把他自己关在书斋里，面前堆着一大叠文件，这一堆文件谁看了都会吃惊，但平常总还是难于满足他那强盛的工作欲。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This time, however, the dossiers were merely a façade; Villefort was not shutting himself up to work but to reflect; and, once the door was shut and the order had been given that he should be disturbed only in an emergency, he sat down in the chair and went over in his mind everything that in the past week or so had filled his cup of bitter sorrows and dark memories to overflowing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是这一次，这些文件只是形式而已，维尔福静处的目的不是在工作而是在反省。门已经闩上，仆人那里也已吩咐过，除非有重要大事，不许来打扰他，于是他在圈椅里坐下来，开始细细地思索这一星期来累得他神魂不安、始终痛苦地在他的头脑里萦回不已的那些事情。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他们的数目现在已达到惊人的地步，他开始有点害怕起来，但这些名字虽然有力，却也曾常常使他满意地微笑，象是一个旅客在到达山顶以后，回头俯视脚下那些他曾惊险万状地爬上来的嵯峨的峰峦、可怕的岩崖以及几乎无法通过的狭径。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When he had gone through all the names in his memory, re-read them, studied them and commented on each list, he shook his head. "No," he muttered. "None of those enemies would have waited and toiled patiently until now to come and crush me with this secret."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他在他的记忆里把所有这些名字默诵了一遍，又参照名单上的记载重读一遍，研究了一番，他摇摇头。“不！”他低声地说，“我的敌人没有哪一个会辛辛苦苦地耐心工作这么久的时间，等到现在才用这个秘密来压垮我。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Monte Cristo learned it and wanted to verify it…"But why want to verify?" he wondered after a moment's reflection. "What interest can a dark, mysterious and inconsequential event like that have for Monsieur de Monte Cristo, Monsieur Zaccone, son of a Maltese shipowner and operator of a Thessalian silver mine, who is paying his first visit to France? Among the jumble of information I obtained from that Abbé Busoni and Lord Wilmore, the friend and the enemy, only one thing stands out clearly and plainly in my view, which is that at no time, in no event and under no circumstances can there have been the slightest contact between him and me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="基督山先生或许曾从旁人口里听到过，而为了探明真相——但他为什么要探明这件事情的真相呢？”维尔福先生在思索了一会儿以后，这样自问。“但这和这位基督山先生或柴康先生有什么关系呢？他是一个马耳他船商的儿子，曾在塞萨利发现一个银矿，现在是初次来访问巴黎——他何必要查究这样一件悲惨、神秘和无用的事实呢？布沙尼长老和威玛勋爵——那个朋友和那个仇人——所给我的各种消息虽不尽符合，但据我看来，有一点是可以明确地断定的——就是不论在哪一个时期，不论在哪一件事情上，不论在哪一种环境里，他和我之间都不曾有过任何接触。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But Villefort said this without believing his own words. The worst thing, for him, was not the revelation of what he had done, because he could deny it, or even reply to the accusation. It was not the Mene, mene, tekel, upharsin suddenly appearing in bloody letters on the wall; what troubled him was not knowing to what body the hand that traced them belonged.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但维尔福所说的这几句话甚至连他自己都不相信。他怕的倒不是事情被揭发出来，因为他可以辩护或否认它的真实性；他并不十分顾忌那突然在墙上出现的血字①；他真正急于想发现的是，究竟这些血字是哪一个人的手把它写下来的。【注：①见《旧约》《但以理书》第五章，伯沙撒王设宴纵饮，忽见手指在粉墙上写了几个大字。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Just as he was trying to reassure himself -- and, in place of the political career which he had sometimes envisaged in his ambitious imaginings, he was resigning himself to a future confined to the joys of family life, for fear of awakening this long-dormant enemy -- he heard the sound of a carriage outside, then the steps of an old person on the stairs, followed by sobs and exclamations of "Alas!", of the kind that servants emit when they want to make themselves interesting because of their masters' sorrows.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他竭力抑平自己的恐惧，开始幻想起来。他以前常常幻想他的政治前途，这是他野心的梦想的主题，但今天他没有去想那方面的事情，他深怕惊醒了那睡了这么久的敌人，只为自己想象一幅限于享受家庭之乐的远景。他正在这样幻想的时候，前庭里传来一辆马车滚动的声音，接着他听到一个老年人的脚步踏上楼梯，后面跟随着一片哭泣和悲叹声，这是仆人们的常态，表示他们也很关切主人的伤心事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He hastened to pull back the bolt on his study door and soon, unannounced, an old woman came in, a shawl on her arm and a hat in her hand.

<div class="line_en">"A week ago," Mme de Saint-Méran continued. "We were getting into the carriage after dinner. For some days, Monsieur de Saint-Méran had been unwell, yet the idea of seeing our dear Valentine gave him strength despite his pain. He was just starting out when, six leagues from Marseille, after taking his usual pills, he fell into an unnaturally deep sleep. I was unwilling to wake him, but then his face seemed to go red and the veins in his temples to beat more violently than usual. However, as it was now night and getting too dark to see, I let him sleep. Shortly afterwards he gave a dull, heart-rending cry, like a man tormented by a nightmare, and sharply threw back his head. I called the valet, had the coach stopped, called to Monsieur de Saint-Méran and got him to breathe my sal volatile, but it was all over, he was dead and I journeyed to Aix seated beside his corpse."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“一个星期以前，”圣·米兰夫人又说，“我们吃过午餐就一同乘着马车出发。圣·米兰先生已经有几天感到不怎么舒服。但是，想到又可以看到我们亲爱的凡兰蒂，他就鼓起勇气，不顾自己的病，照常起程。当我们离开马赛十八哩路，吃了一些他常服的金锭丹以后，他就沉沉睡去。我觉得他的睡觉有点不自然，可是我又不敢喊醒他，我好象觉得他的脸色转红，他太阳穴上的血管跳得比平常凶。但是，因为那时天色渐渐黑了，我看不清了，我就让他去睡。突然间，他发出一声含糊不清的痛苦的喊声，象是一个人在梦中受到了痛苦似的，他的头猛然往后一倒。我喊住车夫，我唤叫圣·米兰先生，我用我的嗅盐给他闻，但一切都完了，我坐在一个尸体旁边到达埃克斯。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Monsieur de Saint-Méran is dead," the old marchioness said, coming directly to the matter, but without any sign of feeling, in a kind of stupor.</div>

<div class="line_en">At that word, the marchioness looked up and, seeing the man who reminded her of the much-mourned daughter who seemed to live again for her in Valentine, struck by the name of "mother", she burst into tears and sank to her knees before a chair in which she buried her venerable head. Villefort told the women to look after her, while old Barrois hurried across in a state of consternation to his master: nothing terrifies old people so much as when death leaves their side to strike down another old person. Then, while Mme de Saint-Méran, still kneeling, began to pray from the depths of her heart, Villefort sent for a carriage and took it himself to collect his wife and daughter from Mme de Morcerf's. He was so pale when he got to the door of the drawing-room that Valentine ran across to him, crying: "Oh, father! Something terrible has happened!"</div>

<div class="line_en">This time, as usual, she walked two or three times round among her flowers, but without picking any. The mourning in her heart, though it had not yet had time to be reflected in her dress, rejected that simple ornament. Then she went over to the path by the gate. As she was going there, she thought she heard a voice speaking her name. She stopped short in astonishment.</div>
