<div class="line_en">Then the man went home, and when he arrived there, the entire palace was made of polished marble with alabaster statues and golden decoration. Soldiers were marching outside the gate, blowing trumpets and beating tympani and drums. Inside the house, barons and counts and dukes were walking around like servants. They opened the doors for him, which were made of pure gold. He went inside where his wife was sitting on a throne made of one piece of gold a good two miles high, and she was wearing a large golden crown that was three yards high, all set with diamonds and carbuncles. In the one hand she had a scepter, and in the other the imperial orb. Bodyguards were standing in two rows at her sides: each one smaller than the other, beginning with the largest giant and ending with the littlest dwarf, who was no larger than my little finger. Many princes and dukes were standing in front of her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，渔夫往回走，到家时一看，整座宫殿都由研磨抛光的大理石砌成，石膏浮雕和纯金装饰四处可见。宫殿门前，士兵们正在列队行进，号角声，锣鼓声，震耳欲聋。在宫殿里，男爵、伯爵走来走去，个个一副奴才相。纯金铸造的房门为他一道道打开，他走进一看，妻子正坐在宝座上，宝座用一整块金子锻造而成，有数千英尺高。她头戴一顶宽大的金冠，足有三码高，上面镶嵌着无数珠宝；她一只手里握着皇仗，另一只手托着金球。在她的两侧，站着两列侍从，一个比一个矮，最高的看上去像个巨人，最矮的是个小侏儒，还没有他的手指大。她的面前侍立着不少王孙贵族。">查看中文翻译</div>

He felt sick all over, and his knees and legs were shaking, and the wind was blowing over the land, and clouds flew by as the darkness of evening fell.
