<div class="line_en">He was very much admired indeed. "He is as beautiful as a weathercock," remarked one of the Town Councillors who wished to gain a reputation for having artistic taste; "only not quite so useful," he added, fearing lest people should think him unpractical, which he really was not.</div>

<div class="line_en">One night there flew over the city a little Swallow. His friends had gone away to Egypt six weeks before, but he had stayed behind, for he was in love with the most beautiful Reed. He had met her early in the spring as he was flying down the river after a big yellow moth, and had been so attracted by her slender waist that he had stopped to talk to her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有天夜里，一只小燕子从城市上空飞过。他的朋友们早在六个星期前就飞往埃及去了，可他却留在了后面，因为他太留恋那美丽无比的芦苇小姐。他是在早春时节遇上她的，当时他正顺河而下去追逐一只黄色的大飞蛾。他为她那纤细的腰身着了迷，便停下身来同她说话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Shall I love you said the Swallow", who liked to come to the point at once, and the Reed made him a low bow. So he flew round and round her, touching the water with his wings, and making silver ripples. This was his courtship, and it lasted all through the summer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我可以爱你吗？”燕子问道，他喜欢一下子就谈到正题上。芦苇向他弯下了腰，于是他就绕着她飞了一圆又一圈，并用羽翅轻抚着水面，泛起层层银色的涟漪。这是燕子的求爱方式，他就这样地进行了整个夏天。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It is a ridiculous attachment," twittered the other Swallows, "she has no money, and far too many relations;" and indeed the river was quite full of Reeds. Then, when the autumn came, they all flew away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这种恋情实在可笑，”其他燕子吃吃地笑着说，“她既没钱财，又有那么多亲戚。”的确，河里到处都是芦苇。等秋天一到，燕子们就飞走了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After they had gone he felt lonely, and began to tire of his lady-love. "She has no conversation," he said, "and I am afraid that she is a coquette, for she is always flirting with the wind." And certainly, whenever the wind blew, the Reed made the most graceful curtsies. "I admit that she is domestic," he continued, "but I love travelling, and my wife, consequently, should love travelling also."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大伙走后，他觉得很孤独，并开始讨厌起自己的恋人。“她不会说话，”他说，“况且我担心她是个荡妇，你看她老是跟风调情。”这可不假，一旦起风，芦苇便行起最优雅的屈膝礼。“我承认她是个居家过日子的人，”燕子继续说，“可我喜爱旅行，而我的妻子，当然也应该喜爱旅行才对。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You have been trifling with me," he cried, "I am off to the Pyramids. Good-bye!" and he flew away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“原来你跟我是闹着玩的，”他吼叫着，“我要去金字塔了，再见吧！”说完他就飞走了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">All day long he flew, and at night-time he arrived at the city. "Where shall I put up?" he said "I hope the town has made preparations."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他飞了整整一天，夜晚时才来到这座城市。“我去哪儿过夜呢？”他说，“我希望城里已做好了准备。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then he saw the statue on the tall column. "I will put up there," he cried; "it is a fine position with plenty of fresh air." So he alighted just between the feet of the Happy Prince.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，他看见了高大圆柱上的雕像。“我就在那儿过夜，”他高声说，“这是个好地方，充满了新鲜空气。”于是，他就在快乐王子两脚之间落了窝。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I have a golden bedroom," he said softly to himself as he looked round, and he prepared to go to sleep; but just as he was putting his head under his wing, a large drop of water fell on him. "What a curious thing!" he cried, "there is not a single cloud in the sky, the stars are quite clear and bright, and yet it is raining. The climate in the north of Europe is really dreadful. The Reed used to like the rain, but that was merely her selfishness."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我有黄金做的卧室，”他朝四周看看后轻声地对自己说，随之准备入睡了。但就在他把头放在羽翅下面的时候，一颗大大的水珠落在他的身上。“真是不可思议！”他叫了起来，“天上没有一丝云彩，繁星清晰又明亮，却偏偏下起了雨。北欧的天气真是可怕。芦苇是喜欢雨水的，可那只是她自私罢了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then another drop fell.</div>

<div class="line_en">The eyes of the Happy Prince were filled with tears, and tears were running down his golden cheeks. His face was so beautiful in the moonlight that the little Swallow was filled with pity.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="快乐王子的双眼充满了泪水，泪珠顺着他金黄的脸颊淌了下来。王子的脸在月光下美丽无比，小燕子顿生怜悯之心。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“那么你为什么哭呢？”燕子又问，“你把我的身上都打湿了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"When I was alive and had a human heart," answered the statue, "I did not know what tears were, for I lived in the Palace of Sans-Souci where sorrow is not allowed to enter. In the daytime I played with my companions in the garden, and in the evening I led the dance in the Great Hall. Round the garden ran a very lofty wall, but I never cared to ask what lay beyond it, everything about me was so beautiful. My courtiers called me the Happy Prince, and happy indeed I was, if pleasure be happiness. So I lived, and so I died. And now that I am dead they have set me up here so high that I can see all the ugliness and all the misery of my city, and though my heart is made of lead yet I cannot choose but weep."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“以前在我有颗人心而活着的时候，”雕像开口说道，“我并不知道眼泪是什么东西，因为那时我住在逍遥自在的王宫里，那是个哀愁无法进去的地方。白天人们伴着我在花园里玩，晚上我在大厅里领头跳舞。沿着花园有一堵高高的围墙，可我从没想到去围墙那边有什么东西，我身边的一切太美好了。我的臣仆们都叫我快乐王子，的确，如果欢愉就是快乐的话，那我真是快乐无比。我就这么活着，也这么死去。而眼下我死了，他们把我这么高高地立在这儿，使我能看见自己城市中所有的丑恶和贫苦，尽管我的心是铅做的，可我还是忍不住要哭。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Far away," continued the statue in a low musical voice, "far away in a little street there is a poor house. One of the windows is open, and through it I can see a woman seated at a table. Her face is thin and worn, and she has coarse, red hands, all pricked by the needle, for she is a seamstress. She is embroidering passion-fowers on a satin gown for the loveliest of the Queen's maids-of-honour to wear at the next Court-ball. In a bed in the corner of the room her little boy is lying ill. He has a fever, and is asking for oranges. His mother has nothing to give him but river water, so he is crying. Swallow, Swallow, little Swallow, will you not bring her the ruby out of my sword-hilt? My feet are fastened to this pedestal and I cannot move."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“远处，”雕像用低缓而悦耳的声音继续说，“远处的一条小街上住着一户穷人。一扇窗户开着，透过窗户我能看见一个女人坐在桌旁。她那瘦削的脸上布满了倦意，一双粗糙发红的手上到处是针眼，因为她是一个裁缝。她正在给缎子衣服绣上西番莲花，这是皇后最喜爱的宫女准备在下一次宫廷舞会上穿的。在房间角落里的一张床上躺着她生病的孩子。孩子在发烧，嚷着要吃桔子。他的妈妈除给他喂几口河水外什么也没有，因此孩子老是哭个不停。燕子，燕子，小燕子，你愿意把我剑柄上的红宝石取下来送给她吗？我的双脚被固定在这基座上，不能动弹。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I am waited for in Egypt," said the Swallow. "My friends are flying up and down the Nile, and talking to the large lotus flowers. Soon they will go to sleep in the tomb of the great King. The King is there himself in his painted coffin. He is wrapped in yellow linen, and embalmed with spices. Round his neck is a chain of pale green jade, and his hands are like withered leaves."</div>

<div class="line_en">"I don't think I like boys," answered the Swallow. "Last summer, when I was staying on the river, there were two rude boys, the miller's sons, who were always throwing stones at me. They never hit me, of course; we swallows fly far too well for that, and besides, I come of a family famous for its agility; but still, it was a mark of disrespect."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我觉得自己不喜欢小孩，”燕子回答说，“去年夏天，我到过一条河边，有两个顽皮的孩于，是磨坊主的儿子，他们老是扔石头打我。当然，他们永远也别想打中我，我们燕子飞得多快呀，再说，我出身于一个以快捷出了名的家庭；可不管怎么说，这是不礼貌的行为。”">查看中文翻译</div>

He passed over the Ghetto, and saw the old Jews bargaining with each other, and weighing out money in copper scales. At last he came to the poor house and looked in. The boy was tossing feverishly on his bed, and the mother had fallen asleep, she was so tired. In he hopped, and laid the great ruby on the table beside the woman's thimble.

<div class="line_en">So the Swallow plucked out the Prince's eye, and flew away to the student's garret. It was easy enough to get in, as there was a hole in the roof. Through this he darted, and came into the room. The young man had his head buried in his hands, so he did not hear the flutter of the bird's wings, and when he looked up he found the beautiful sapphire lying on the withered violets.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因此燕子取下了王子的一只眼睛，朝学生住的阁楼飞去了。由于屋顶上有一个洞，燕子很容易进去。就这样燕子穿过洞来到屋里。年轻人双手捂着脸，没有听见燕子翅膀的扇动声，等他抬起头时，正看见那颗美丽的蓝宝石放在干枯的紫罗兰上面。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The next day the Swallow flew down to the harbour. He sat on the mast of a large vessel and watched the sailors hauling big chests out of the hold with ropes. "Heave a-hoy!" they shouted as each chest came up. "I am going to Egypt!" cried the Swallow, but nobody minded, and when the moon rose he flew back to the Happy Prince.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天燕子飞到下面的海港，他坐在一震大船的桅杆上，望着水手们用绳索把大箱子拖出船舱。随着他们嘿哟！嘿哟！”的声声号子，一个个大箱子给拖了上来。“我要去埃及了！”燕子略道，但是没有人理会他。等月亮升起后，他又飞回到快乐王子的身边。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It is winter," answered the Swallow, and the chill snow will soon be here. In Egypt the sun is warm on the green palm-trees, and the crocodiles lie in the mud and look lazily about them. My companions are building a nest in the Temple of Baalbec, and the pink and white doves are watching them, and cooing to each other. Dear Prince, I must leave you, but I will never forget you, and next spring I will bring you back two beautiful jewels in place of those you have given away. The ruby shall be redder than a red rose, and the sapphire shall be as blue as the great sea.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“冬天到了，”燕子回答说，“寒冷的雪就要来了。而在埃及，太阳挂在葱绿的棕搁树上，暖和极了，还有躺在泥塘中的鳄鱼懒洋洋地环顾着四周。我的朋友们正在巴尔贝克古城的神庙里建筑巢穴，那些粉红和银白色的鸽子们一边望着他们干活，一边相互倾诉着情话。亲爱的王子，我不得不离你而去了，只是我永远也不会忘记你的，明年春天我要给你带回两颗美丽的宝石，弥补你因送给别人而失掉的那西颗，红宝石会比一朵红玫瑰还红，蓝宝石也比大海更蓝。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">All the next day he sat on the Prince's shoulder, and told him stories of what he had seen in strange lands. He told him of the red ibises, who stand in long rows on the banks of the Nile, and catch gold fish in their beaks; of the Sphinx, who is as old as the world itself, and lives in the desert, and knows everything; of the merchants, who walk slowly by the side of their camels, and carry amber beads in their hands; of the King of the Mountains of the Moon, who is as black as ebony, and worships a large crystal; of the great green snake that sleeps in a palm-tree, and has twenty priests to feed it with honey-cakes; and of the pygmies who sail over a big lake on large flat leaves, and are always at war with the butterflies.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天他整日坐在王子的肩头上，给他讲自己在异国他乡的所见所闻和种种经历。他还给王子讲那些红色的朱鹭，它们排成长长的一行站在尼罗河的岸边，用它们的尖嘴去捕捉金鱼；还讲到司芬克斯，它的岁数跟世界一样长久，住在沙漠中，通晓世间的一切；他讲纽那些商人，跟着自己的驼队缓缓而行，手中摸着狼冶做的念珠；他讲到月亮山的国王，他皮肤黑得像乌木，崇拜一块巨大的水晶；他讲到那条睡在棕祸树上的绿色大莽蛇，要20个僧侣用蜜糖做的糕点来喂它；他又讲到那些小矮人，他们乘坐扁平的大树叶在湖泊中往来横渡，还老与蝴蝶发生战争。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Dear little Swallow," said the Prince, "you tell me of marvellous things, but more marvellous than anything is the suffering of men and of women. There is no Mystery so great as Misery. Fly over my city, little Swallow, and tell me what you see there."</div>

He flew into dark lanes, and saw the white faces of starving children looking out listlessly at the black streets. Under the archway of a bridge two little boys were lying in one another's arms to try and keep themselves warm. "How hungry we are." they said. "You must not lie here," shouted the Watchman, and they wandered out into the rain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是燕子飞过了城市上空，看见富人们在自己漂亮的洋楼里寻欢作乐，而乞丐们却坐在大门口忍饥挨饿。他飞进阴暗的小巷，看见饥饿的孩子们露出苍白的小脸没精打采地望着昏暗的街道，就在一座桥的桥洞里面两个孩子相互搂抱着想使彼此温暖一些。“我们好饿呀！”他俩说。“你们不准躺在这儿，”看守高声叹道，两个孩子又跚蹒着朝雨中走去。">查看中文翻译</div>
