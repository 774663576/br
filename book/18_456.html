<div class="line_en">The other mother looked healthier than before: there was a little blush to her cheeks, and her hair was wriggling like lazy snakes on a warm day. Her black-button eyes seemed as if they had been freshly polished. She had pushed through the mirror as if she were walking through nothing more solid than water and had stared down at Coraline. Then she had opened the door with the little silver key. She picked Coraline up, just as Coraline's real mother had when Coraline was much younger, cradling the half-sleeping child as if she were a baby.</div>

<div class="line_en">"There, my sweet Coraline," said her other mother. "I came and fetched you out of the cupboard. You needed to be taught a lesson, but we temper our justice with mercy here, we love the sinner and we hate the sin. Now, if you will be a good child who loves her mother, be compliant and fair-spoken, you and I shall understand each other perfectly and we shall love each other perfectly as well."</div>

<div class="line_en">Her other mother smiled gently. With one hand she cracked the eggs into a bowl, with the other she whisked them and whirled them.

She poured the melted butter and the cheese into the egg mixture, and whisked it some more.</div>

<div class="line_en">The other mother sat down at the kitchen table and leaned back against the wall, saying nothing. She picked at her teeth with a long crimson-varnished fingernail, then she tapped the finger gently, tap-tap-tap, against the polished black surface of her black-button eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="另一个妈妈在橱柜边坐下，向后一仰，靠在墙上，什么都没说。她用一根长长的红指甲剔着牙，剔完以后，又用这根指头一下一下轻轻敲打擦得亮铮铮的黑纽扣眼睛：嗒，嗒，嗒。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“不说就不说，”卡萝兰说，“有什么了不起的。说不说都一样。谁都知道，灵魂跟水球大小差不多。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She was hoping the other mother would say something like, "Nonsense, they're the size of ripe onions -- or suitcases -- or grandfather clocks," but the other mother simply smiled, and the tap-tap-tapping of her fingernail against her eye was as steady and relentless as the drip of water droplets from the tap into the sink. And then, Coraline realised, it was simply the noise of the water, and she was alone in the room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她一心指望另一个妈妈落进这个圈套，接过她的话头说，“胡说，灵魂只有熟透了的洋葱那么大”，或者手提箱那么大，或者老爷爷的座钟那么大。可另一个妈妈只是笑，继续用指甲敲打纽扣眼睛。嗒，嗒，嗒，不紧不慢，一直不停敲打下去，像水龙头朝水池里滴水似的。接着，卡萝兰发现，真的是水龙头滴水的声音。房间里只有她一个人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Coraline looked at her, and Coraline thought hard. There was no point, she decided, in exploring the garden and the grounds: they didn't exist, they weren't real. There was no abandoned tennis court in the other mother's world, no bottomless well. All that was real was the house itself. She looked around the kitchen. She opened the oven, peered into the freezer, poked into the salad compartment of the fridge. The other mother followed her about, looking at Coraline with a smirk always hovering at the edge of her lips.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡萝兰望着她，暗暗动脑筋。她断定，肯定不在园子里。远处更不会，因为根本没有什么远处，本来在远处的东西全都没有了。在另一个妈妈的世界里，没有那个废弃的旧网球场，也没有那口井。只有宅子是真实的。她从厨房开始。打开烤箱，朝冰箱里张望，在冰箱的沙拉格子里东翻西找。另一个妈妈跟在她身后，看着卡萝兰找，嘴角还挂着一丝嘲笑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Coraline looked down at her hand, surprised: it was just a pebble with a hole in it, a nondescript brown stone. Then she looked back into the mirror where the stone glimmered like an emerald. A trail of green fire blew from the stone in the mirror, and drifted towards Coraline's bedroom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡萝兰吓了一跳，低头看着手里。只是一块普普通通的褐色卵石，中间有个洞眼。她又朝镜子里看。镜子里的石头亮晶晶的，像一块绿宝石。一线绿火从镜子里的卵石上飘出来，朝卡萝兰的卧室飘去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She glanced at the mirror at the end of the hall. For a moment it clouded over, and it seemed to her that faces swam in the glass, indistinct and shapeless, and then the faces were gone, and there was nothing in the mirror but a girl who was small for her age holding something that glowed gently, like a green coal.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她望着走道尽头那面镜子。有一会儿工夫，它上面蒙了一层雾，镜子里好像有几张模模糊糊、没形没状的脸，动来动去。接着，脸不见了。镜子里什么都没有，只有一个小个子小姑娘，手里拿着一件发着淡淡绿光的东西，像一块绿莹莹的煤。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Coraline shivered. She preferred the other mother to have a location: if she were nowhere, then she could be anywhere. And, after all, it is always easier to be afraid of something you cannot see. She put her hands into her pockets and her fingers closed around the reassuring shape of the stone with the hole in it. She pulled it out of her pocket, held it in front of her as if she were holding a gun, and walked out into the hall. There was no sound but the tap-tap of the water dripping into the metal sink.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡萝兰打了个哆嗦。她希望另一个妈妈能实实在在地在什么地方。如果什么地方都找不着她，她就可能在任何地方。还有，看不见的东西总是更吓人。她双手插进口袋，握住那块上面带洞眼、让人觉得踏实的石头。她把它从口袋里掏出来，像端枪瞄准一样凑到眼睛跟前，走进过道。静悄悄的，只有水滴在金属水池里的嗒嗒声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Coraline looked around the room. She looked in the cupboards and the drawers. Then she picked up one end of the toybox and tipped all the toys in it out on to the carpet, where they grumbled and stretched and wiggled awkwardly free of each other. A grey marble rolled across the floor and clicked against the wall. None of the toys looked particularly soul-like, she thought. She picked up and examined a silver charm-bracelet from which hung tiny animal charms which chased each other around the perimeter of the bracelet, the fox never catching the rabbit, the bear never gaining on the fox.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡萝兰四处找。她在柜子里找，在抽屉里找。又抓住玩具盒子一边，把玩具全部倒在地毯上。玩具们吵吵嚷嚷，笨手笨脚地四下乱爬。一颗灰色大理石弹子一直滚到房间另一头，撞在墙上。卡萝兰心想，没有哪件玩具看上去特别像灵魂呀。她拾起一只魔法银手镯，手镯里关着中了魔法的小动物，不停地绕着手镯追来追去。狐狸追兔子，狗熊追狐狸，可谁也追不上谁。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She walked into the bedroom. The toys fluttered excitedly as she came in, as if they were pleased to see her, and a little tank rolled out of the toybox to greet her, its treads rolling over several other toys. It fell from the toybox on to the floor, tipping as it fell, and it lay on the carpet like a beetle on its back, grumbling and grinding its treads before Coraline picked it up and turned it over. The tank fled under the bed in embarrassment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她走进卧室。玩具们高兴地扑腾着，好像很高兴看到她。一辆小坦克的履带从其他玩具身上滚过，想从玩具盒子里翻出来欢迎她。它从玩具盒子翻到地板上，结果翻了个个儿，履带朝天哼哼着。卡萝兰替它翻了个身。坦克害臊了，飞快钻进床底。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She was about to leave and look elsewhere. And then she remembered a voice in the darkness, a gentle whispering voice, and what it had told her to do. She raised the stone with the hole in it, and held it in front of her right eye. She closed her left eye and looked at the room through the hole in the stone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她正想离开卧室，忽然想起以前在一片黑暗中听过的一个声音，一句悄悄话。她想起那个声音是怎么说的。卡萝兰举起带洞眼的石头，凑在右眼上。她闭上左眼，从洞眼里看着这个房间。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Most of the toys that had been in the toybox had now crawled away to hide under the bed, and the few toys that were left (a green plastic soldier, the glass marble, a vivid pink yo-yo, and such) were the kind of things you find in the bottoms of toyboxes in the real world: forgotten objects, abandoned and unloved.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="以前待在玩具盒子里的玩具大多数躲到床下去了，只有很少几件留在外面：一个绿色的塑料兵，那颗灰色大理石弹子，一个粉红色的溜溜球，等等。这些都是压在玩具盒子最底下的玩具，被抛弃了，没人理，没人爱。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Through the stone, the world was grey and colourless, like a pencil drawing. Everything in it was grey -- no, not quite everything. Something glinted on the floor, something the colour of an ember in a nursery fireplace, the colour of a scarlet-and-orange tulip nodding in the May sun. Coraline reached out her left hand, scared that if she took her eye off it it would vanish, and she fumbled for the burning thing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="透过洞眼望出去，这个世界变成了灰扑扑的一片，像铅笔画的颜色。里面的所有东西都是灰色的——不，不是所有东西：地板上有个发亮的东西，像儿童室壁炉里没有燃尽的火头，又像五月里冲太阳直点头的郁金香，橘黄带红。卡萝兰伸出左手。她不敢让右手的石头离开眼睛，生怕一拿开石头，那个亮东西就会不见了。于是她的左手到处摸，寻找那个闪闪发亮的东西。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">If I'm going to do this, thought Coraline, I'm not going to do it in her clothes. She changed back into her pyjamas and her dressing gown and her slippers, leaving the grey sweater and the black jeans neatly folded up on the bed, the orange boots on the floor by the toy box.

She covered her eyes, and pushed forward.</div>

<div class="line_en">Her fingers closed about something smooth and cool. She snatched it up, and then lowered the stone with the hole in it from her eye and looked down. The grey glass marble from the bottom of the toybox sat, dully, in the pink palm of her hand. She raised the stone to her eye once more, and looked through it at the marble. Once again the marble burned and flickered with a red fire.</div>

The lamps around the door were flickering on and off almost randomly now, spelling out no words that Coraline could understand. The door was closed. She was afraid it was locked, and she pushed on it with all her strength. First it stuck, then suddenly it gave, and, with a jerk, Coraline stumbled into the dark room beyond.</div>

Coraline resisted the urge to look. In a couple of strides she reached the front door, and she walked outside.</div>

<div class="line_en">Something rustled once again. Coraline directed her light beam upwards, towards the ceiling. There were things up there, hairless, jellyish.

<div class="line_en">Coraline closed one hand around the stone with the hole in it and walked forward into blackness. She expected to find a curtained anteroom, but there was nothing there. The room was dark. The theatre was empty. She moved ahead cautiously. Something rustled above her. She looked up into a deeper darkness, and as she did so her feet knocked against something. She reached down, picked up a torch, and clicked it on, sweeping the beam around the room.</div>

Whatever was glowing was being held in one of the hands of the thing on the wall.</div>

<div class="line_en">She had never been so scared, but still she walked forward until she reached the sac. Then she pushed her hand into the sticky, clinging whiteness of the stuff on the wall. It crackled softly, like a tiny fire, as she pushed, and it clung to her skin and clothes like a spider's web clings, like white candy-floss. She pushed her hand into it, and she reached upward until she touched a cold hand, which was, she could feel, closed around another glass marble. The creature's skin felt slippery, as if it had been covered in jelly. Coraline tugged at the marble.</div>

<div class="line_en">At first nothing happened; it was held tight in the creature's grasp. Then, one by one, the fingers loosened their grip, and the marble slipped into her hand. She pulled her arm back through the sticky webbing, relieved that the thing's eyes had not opened. She shone the light on its faces: they resembled, she decided, the younger versions of Miss Spink and Miss Forcible, but twisted and squeezed together, like two lumps of wax that had melted and melded together into one ghastly object.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一开始，弹子动都不动一下。怪物攥得非常紧。接着，怪物的手指头一根接一根松开，弹子滑进她的手里。卡萝兰把胳膊从那一大团黏糊糊的东西里抽回来。怪物没睁开眼睛，她长长地松了一口气。她用手电照了照它的两张脸，觉得很像年轻时候的斯平克小姐和福斯波尔小姐。问题是，这两张脸歪歪扭扭，挤在一起，像两团融化后压成一块的蜡，成了一个让人吓破胆子的可怕东西。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Without warning, one of the creature's hands made a grab for Coraline's arm. Its fingernails scraped her skin, but it was too slippery to grip, and Coraline pulled away successfully. And then the eyes opened -- four black buttons glinting and staring down at her -- and two voices that sounded like no voice that Coraline had ever heard began to speak to her. One of them wailed and whispered, the other buzzed like a fat and angry bluebottle at a windowpane, but the voices said, as one person, "Thief! Give it back! Stop! Thief!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="事先一点动静没有，可突然间，怪物的一只手向前一伸，抓住卡萝兰的胳膊。指甲划在她的皮肤上，嚓嚓响。幸好它又黏又滑，抓不住，卡萝兰这才抽回胳膊。就在这时，它的眼睛睁开了，四只黑黑的纽扣眼睛，从上往下瞪着她。它还会说话，声音混合着两个嗓门。一个尖尖的，很嘶哑；另一个瓮声瓮气，嗡嗡嗡的很单调，像爬在窗户玻璃上的大苍蝇。卡萝兰一辈子都没听过这种声音。这两个嗓门开口了，像一个人。“小偷！东西还来！还来！小偷！”">查看中文翻译</div>
