<div class="line_en">Cat and Fox and Marionette walked and walked and walked. At last, toward evening, dead tired, they came to the Inn of the Red Lobster.</div>

<div class="line_en">They went into the Inn and all three sat down at the same table. However, not one of them was very hungry.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Fox, after a great deal of coaxing, tried his best to eat a little. The doctor had put him on a diet, and he had to be satisfied with a small hare dressed with a dozen young and tender spring chickens. After the hare, he ordered some partridges, a few pheasants, a couple of rabbits, and a dozen frogs and lizards. That was all. He felt ill, he said, and could not eat another bite.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="狐狸虽然想吃，可大夫规定它要严格节制饮食，因此它只好吃得简单点，就吃了一只肥美的野兔，周围摆满一圈肥嫩的童子鸡，吃完野兔，它又要了一大批饭后点心：鸡杂炒蛋，鹧鸪，家兔，田鸡、晰蜴，甜葡萄。接下来就不要什么了。它说食物已经叫它作呕，它一口也吃不下去了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The poor Cat felt very weak, and he was able to eat only thirty-five mullets with tomato sauce and four portions of tripe with cheese. Moreover, as he was so in need of strength, he had to have four more helpings of butter and cheese.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可怜的猫说它肚子很不舒服，只要吃三十五条香茄酱火兔、四份奶酪杂碎，因为觉得杂碎味道不够好，又添了三次牛油和奶酪粉！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Give us two good rooms, one for Mr. Pinocchio and the other for me and my friend. Before starting out, we'll take a little nap. Remember to call us at midnight sharp, for we must continue on our journey."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="吃完晚饭，狐狸对老极说：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Pinocchio ate least of all. He asked for a bite of bread and a few nuts and then hardly touched them. The poor fellow, with his mind on the Field of Wonders, was suffering from a gold-piece indigestion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吃得最少的是皮诺乔。他只要了点核桃，还要了块面包，可结果都留在盘子里没吃，这可怜孩子光顾着想‘奇迹宝地’，好像金币己经把他撑饱了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, sir," answered the Innkeeper, winking in a knowing way at the Fox and the Cat, as if to say, "I understand."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是，先生们，”老板回答着，对狐狸和猫眨眨眼，像是说：“有数有数，算说定了！……”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As soon as Pinocchio was in bed, he fell fast asleep and began to dream. He dreamed he was in the middle of a field. The field was full of vines heavy with grapes. The grapes were no other than gold coins which tinkled merrily as they swayed in the wind. They seemed to say, "Let him who wants us take us!". Just as Pinocchio stretched out his hand to take a handful of them, he was awakened by three loud knocks at the door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮诺乔一上床就睡着了，睡着了就做梦，他梦见自己在一块地当中。这块地满是矮矮的树，树上挂满一串一串的东西，这一串一串的东西都是金币，让风吹着，发出丁、丁、丁的声音，听着像说：“谁高兴就来采我们吧，”可正当皮诺乔兴高采烈，伸手要去采这些漂亮的金币，把它们全给放进口袋的时候，忽然给房门上很响的三下敲门声惊醒了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He walked on, not knowing where he was going, for it was dark, so dark that not a thing was visible. Round about him, not a leaf stirred. A few bats skimmed his nose now and again and scared him half to death. Once or twice he shouted, "Who goes there?" and the far-away hills echoed back to him, "Who goes there? Who goes there? Who goes...."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他可以说是摸索着走的，因为旅馆外面一片漆黑，黑得伸手不见五指。四周田野上连一点叶子沙沙声也听不见。只有一些夜鸟不时打一丛树上飞到另一丛树上，在路上穿过，用翅膀碰到了他的鼻子，他吓得向后直跳，大叫起来：“什么人？”周围的小土岗发出回声，拉长声音反复说着：“什么人？什么人？什么人？”">查看中文翻译</div>
