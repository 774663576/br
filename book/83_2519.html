<div class="line_en">Light steps, the steps of a woman, came along the invisible pathway and the man in front of me moved forward and seemed to lean against the fog. I couldn't see the woman, then I could see her indistinctly. The arrogant carriage of her head seemed familiar. The man stepped out very quickly. The two figures blended in the fog, seemed to be part of the fog. There was dead silence for a moment. Then the man said:</div>

<div class="line_en">The girl didn't make a sound. I moved forward a step. Quite suddenly I could see the foggy fuzz on the man's hat brim. The girl stood motionless. Then her breathing began to make a rasping sound, like a small file on soft wood.</div>

<div class="line_en">She didn't yell. She didn't move. There was a movement from him, and a dry chuckle. "It better be in here," he said. A catch clicked and a fumbling sound came to me. The man turned and came towards my tree. When he had taken three or four steps he chuckled again. The chuckle was something out of my own memories. I reached a pipe out of my pocket and held it like a gun.</div>

<div class="line_en">The fog swallowed him. The faint sound of his steps and then nothing. I picked the bag up and felt in it and went towards the path. She still stood there motionless, a gray fur coat held tight around her throat with an ungloved hand on which a ring made a faint glitter. She wore no hat. Her dark parted hair was part of the darkness of the night. Her eyes too.</div>

<div class="line_en">We went over to a big Cadillac and the man in the smock pulled the rear door open. On the wide back seat, loosely arranged, covered to the chin with a plaid robe, a man lay snoring with his mouth open. He seemed to be a big blond man who would hold a lot of liquor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们走到一辆气派的凯迪拉克跟前，那个穿工装的摇下了后车窗。一个男人邋遢地躺在宽敞的后座上，一条花格毯子拉到了下巴位置，正张着嘴打呼噜。看起来他是个很能喝的高个金发男人。">查看中文翻译</div>

A yacht, a place on Long Island, a place at Newport, a place at Bermuda, places dotted here and there all over the world probably -- just a good Scotch bottle apart.

<div class="line_cn" title="“在那些满脑子不愉快的时候，”她用别扭的高嗓门接着说道，仿佛劫匪造成的惊吓这时才开始显山露水，“我甚至想过嫁给他。我们都有那样的时候。家财万贯，你知道的。游艇，长岛有房子，新港有房子，百慕大有房子，这里那里，也许全世界都有房子——只消喝掉一瓶上好的苏格兰威士忌就能到家。而对于科布先生来说，喝一瓶威士忌花不了多少时间。”">查看中文翻译</div>

I drove down a curving lane of trees on the blind side of the house. The lane opened on De Cazens Boulevard, the main drag of Las Olindas.

<div class="line_en">We drove away from Las Olindas through a series of little dank beach towns with shack-like houses built down on the sand close to the rumble of the surf and larger houses built back on the slopes behind. A yellow window shone here and there, but most of the houses were dark. A smell of kelp came in off the water and lay on the fog. The tires sang on the moist concrete of the boulevard. The world was a wet emptiness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们驱车驶离了拉斯奥林达斯，连着经过好几个潮湿海滩边的镇子，有些状似棚屋的房子建在沙滩上，如泣如诉的海浪声就在近旁；也有些较大的房子建在后面的山坡上。零星能看到窗户里亮着黄色灯光，但大多数屋里是漆黑的。水上飘来一阵海草的味道，附在雾气之上。轮胎在湿漉漉的水泥地上发出“刷刷”的声响。整个世界都是湿的，空空荡荡。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a winking yellow light at the intersection. I turned the car and slid down a slope with a high bluff on one side, interurban tracks to the right, a low straggle of lights far off beyond the tracks, and then very far off a glitter of pier lights and a haze in the sky over a city. That way the fog was almost gone. The road crossed the tracks where they turned to run under the bluff, then reached a paved strip of waterfront highway that bordered an open and uncluttered beach. Cars were parked along the sidewalk, facing out to sea, dark. The lights of the beach club were a few hundred yards away.</div>

<div class="line_en">I moved out from under the wheel into the middle of the seat. She turned her body a little away from me as if to peer out of the window. Then she let herself fall backwards, without a sound, into my arms. Her head almost struck the wheel. Her eyes were closed, her face was dim. Then I saw that her eyes opened and flickered, the shine of them visible even in the darkness.</div>

<div class="line_en">I braked the car against the curb and switched the headlights off and sat with my hands on the wheel. Under the thinning fog the surf curled and creamed, almost without sound, like a thought trying to form itself on the edge of consciousness.</div>
