<div class="line_en">Hallorann could never be sure of the progression of things after that. He remembered that the elevator had gone down and past them without stopping, and something had been inside. But he made no attempt to try to see in through the small diamond-shaped window, because what was in there did not sound human. A moment later there were running footsteps on the stairs. Wendy Torrance at first shrank back against him and then began to stumble down the main corridor to the stairs as fast as she could.</div>

<div class="line_en">Picture of the Overlook, flames leaping out of its roof. Bricks raining down on the snow. Clang of firebells… not that any fire truck would be able to get up here much before the end of March. Most of all what came through in Danny's thought was a sense of urgent immediacy, a feeling that it was going to happen at any time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="远望饭店的画面：火苗窜出了房顶，砖块像雨点似的落在雪地上；火警的铃声…三月末之前一辆救火车也开不上来。流过丹尼思想的大部分东西是紧迫感，一种随时都可能发生灾难的感觉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Danny looked at him from his mother's arms, and Hallorann saw how the boy had changed. His face was pale and pinched, his eyes dark and fathomless.

<div class="line_en">"All right," Hallorann said. He began to move toward the two of them and at first it was like swimming through deep water. His sense of balance was screwed, and the eye on the right side of his face didn't want to focus. His jaw was sending giant throbbing bursts of pain up to his temple and down his neck, and his cheek felt as large as a cabbage. But the boy's urgency had gotten him going, and it got a little easier.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧。”哈洛伦说。他向他俩走过去，开始的几步就像在深水中游泳一样。他不能保持平衡，右眼也聚不了光。他的下颌骨向太阳穴和颈子送去了一阵接一阵的剧烈疼痛，腮部肿得像棵洋白菜。但那孩子的紧迫感催着他往前走起来，他的脚步轻松了一些。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's too late," he said. His eyes stared at them with a desperate kind of madness. He looked at Dick and suddenly Hallorann's mind was fixed with an image of a clock under a glass dome, the clock in the ballroom that had been donated by a Swiss diplomat in 1949. The hands of the clock were standing at a minute to midnight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“来不及了。”他说，眼睛盯着他们，目光里含着极度的疯狂。他看着迪克，突然，哈洛伦的脑子里嵌入了一幅罩在圆顶玻璃罩下的钟的图像，舞厅的那座钟，1949年一位瑞士外交官赠送的。钟的指针指在差1分午夜12点上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Wendy shrieked in pain as he squeezed the bad ribs, as something in her back ground together, but Hallorann did not slow. He plunged down the stairs with them in his arms. One eye wide and desperate, the other puffed shut to a slit. He looked like a one-eyed pirate abducting hostages to be ransomed later.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的手勒在温迪折断的肋骨上，痛得她尖叫起来，但哈洛伦没有放慢脚步，他抱着两人冲下了楼梯。一只眼绝望地圆睁着，另一只眼肿得只剩下了一条缝。他看上去像个劫持人质借以勒索的独眼海盗。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Hallorann burst out through the double doors and carried the two of them through the trench in the big snowdrift on the porch. He saw the hedge animals clearly, more clearly than before, and even as he realized his worst fears were true, that they were between the porch and the snowmobile, the hotel exploded.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈洛伦冲出大门，穿过了门廊上雪堆中的壕沟。他清清楚楚地看见了树篱动物，比往常更清楚，就在他意识到他最大的担心即它们会挡住去路被证实了的时候，饭店爆炸了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The wheel gave, and with a triumphant scream, the thing spun it wide open. A giant roar of escaping steam bellowed out of the boiler, a dozen dragons hissing in concert. But before the steam obscured the pressure needle entirely, the needle had visibly begun to swing back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="转轮松动了，随着一声胜利的尖叫，那个家伙旋开了节流阀。接着，喷射出的蒸汽咆哮起来，十几条巨龙开始了大合唱。在蒸汽完全遮住压力表之前，指针明显开始回落了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I WIN!" it cried. It capered obscenely in the hot, rising mist, waving its flaming hands over its head. "NOT TOO LATE! I WIN! NOT TOO LATE! NOT TOO LATE!

<div class="line_cn" title="“胜利了！”它叫道。它在升腾的滚烫的蒸汽中无耻地雀跃着，头上舞动着它那冒着火苗的手。“不算太晚！胜利了！不算太晚！不晚！不——”他的话变成了一声欢呼，紧接着它的尖叫声便被摧枯拉朽的爆炸声吞没了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a flat explosion, a sound that seemed to exist on one low all -- pervasive note (WHUMMMMMMMMM --) and then there was a blast of warm air at their backs that seemed to push gently at them. They were thrown from the porch on its breath, the three of them, and a confused thought (this is what superman must feel like) slipped through Hallorann's mind as they flew through the air. He lost his hold on them and then he struck the snow in a soft billow. It was down his shirt and up his nose and he was dimly aware that it felt good on his hurt cheek.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爆炸声平淡无奇，听上去像一个弥漫一切的低音符。（轰——）接着，一股热气流刮到了他们背上，仿佛在轻轻地推着他们。然后，气流爆发出来，把他们从门廊上推了出去，他们在空气中飞过时，哈洛伦脑子里溜过了一个含混的想法——超人的感觉一定就是这样的。他们从他手里脱开了，他自己栽进了雪地里，击起了一浪雪粉。雪钻进了他衬衣里，沾在了他鼻子上，他朦胧地意识到他受伤的面颊感觉很舒服。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Overlook's windows shattered. In the ballroom, the dome over the mantelpiece clock cracked, split in two pieces, and fell to the floor. The clock stopped ticking: cogs and gears and balance wheel all became motionless. There was a whispered, sighing noise, and a great billow of dust. In 217 the bathtub suddenly split in two, letting out a small flood of greenish, noxious-smelling water. In the Presidential Suite the wallpaper suddenly burst into flames. The batwing doors of the Colorado Lounge suddenly snapped their hinges and fell to the dining room floor. Beyond the basement arch, the great piles and stacks of old papers caught fire and went up with a blowtorch hiss. Boiling water rolled over the flames but did not quench them. Like burning autumn leaves below a wasps' nest, they whirled and blackened. The furnace exploded, shattering the basement's roofbeams, sending them crashing down like the bones of a dinosaur.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="饭店的窗户震碎了。舞厅里的壁炉台上那座钟的圆顶罩裂成了两块，然后掉在了地板上。钟停止了滴答；轮齿、齿轮和平衡轮全都停止了运动。一片耳语声，叹息声。尘土飞扬。217房间的浴缸突然裂成了两半，流出了一小股绿色的臭水。总统套间的墙纸突然着起火来。科罗拉多休息厅的蝙蝠门的合页突然折断了，门掉在了餐厅地板上。地下室拱门的另一边，大堆大堆的旧纸着了火，像喷灯那样嘶嘶燃烧起来。沸水滚过火焰，但没有浇灭。旧纸像黄蜂窝下燃烧着的秋天的树叶，打着旋，变黑。锅炉爆炸了，粉碎了地下室的横梁，它们像恐龙骨架那样轰然倒塌。">查看中文翻译</div>

The carpeting on the stair risers caught, racing up to the first-floor level as if to tell dreadful good news. A fusillade of explosions ripped the place. The chandelier in the dining room, a two-hundred-pound crystal bomb, fell with a splintering crash, knocking tables every which way. Flame belched out of the Overlook's five chimneys at the breaking clouds.</div>
