<div class="line_en">Late in the winter of my seventeenth year, my mother decided I was depressed, presumably because I rarely left the house, spent quite a lot of time in bed, read the same book over and over, ate infrequently, and devoted quite a bit of my abundant free time to thinking about death.</div>

<div class="line_en">Whenever you read a cancer booklet or website or whatever, they always list depression among the side effects of cancer. But, in fact, depression is not a side effect of cancer. Depression is a side effect of dying. (Cancer is also a side effect of dying. Almost everything is, really.) But my mom believed I required treatment, so she took me to see my Regular Doctor Jim, who agreed that I was veritably swimming in a paralyzing and totally clinical depression, and that therefore my meds should be adjusted and also I should attend a weekly Support Group.</div>

<div class="line_en">So here's how it went in God's heart: The six or seven or ten of us walked/wheeled in, grazed at a decrepit selection of cookies and lemonade, sat down in the Circle of Trust, and listened to Patrick recount for the thousandth time his depressingly miserable life story -- how he had cancer in his balls and they thought he was going to die but he didn't die and now here he is, a full-grown adult in a church basement in the 137th nicest city in America, divorced, addicted to video games, mostly friendless, eking out a meager living by exploiting his cancertastic past, slowly working his way toward a master's degree that will not improve his career prospects, waiting, as we all do, for the sword of Damocles to give him the relief that he escaped lo those many years ago when cancer took both of his nuts but spared what only the most generous soul would call his life.</div>

<div class="line_en">And his eyes were the problem. He had some fantastically improbable eye cancer. One eye had been cut out when he was a kid, and now he wore the kind of thick glasses that made his eyes (both the real one and the glass one) preternaturally huge, like his whole head was basically just this fake eye and this real eye staring at you. From what I could gather on the rare occasions when Isaac shared with the group, a recurrence had placed his remaining eye in mortal peril.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的眼睛就是问题所在。他得了一种离奇得近乎荒谬的眼癌，很小的时候就被摘除了一只眼睛，现在他戴着一副厚厚的眼镜，这眼镜使得他的双眼（一只真的，一只玻璃的）巨大得超乎自然，就好像他的整个脑袋上基本只剩下了这一只假眼和一只真眼，它们一起瞪着你看。艾萨克在小组里倾诉的次数极少，从他的话里我大致得知，他剩下的那只眼睛癌症复发了，有可能致命。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Isaac and I communicated almost exclusively through sighs. Each time someone discussed anticancer diets or snorting ground-up shark fin or whatever, he'd glance over at me and sigh ever so slightly. I'd shake my head microscopically and exhale in response.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="艾萨克和我几乎完全通过叹气声交流。每次有人讨论起抗癌饮食或者用鼻子吸入碾碎的鱼翅粉末之类的话题，艾萨克就会瞟我一眼，轻轻地叹口气；我则微不可察地摇摇头，吐出一声叹息作为回答。">查看中文翻译</div>

Also my hair: I had this pageboy haircut, and I hadn't even bothered to, like, brush it. Furthermore, I had ridiculously fat chipmunked cheeks, a side effect of treatment. I looked like a normally proportioned person with a balloon for a head. This was not even to mention the cankle situation. And yet -- I cut a glance to him, and his eyes were still on me.</div>

<div class="line_en">"What's with the 'always'?" The slurping sounds intensified.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那‘永远’是怎么回事？”啧啧之声愈发激烈。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Always is their thing. They'll always love each other and whatever. I would conservatively estimate they have texted each other the word always four million times in the last year."</div>

<div class="line_en">A couple more cars drove up, taking Michael and Alisa away. It was just Augustus and me now, watching Isaac and Monica, who proceeded apace as if they were not leaning against a place of worship. His hand reached for her boob over her shirt and pawed at it, his palm still while his fingers moved around. I wondered if that felt good. Didn't seem like it would, but I decided to forgive Isaac on the grounds that he was going blind. The senses must feast while there is yet hunger and whatever.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="又有几辆车开过，麦克尔和艾丽莎走了。现在只剩奥古斯塔斯和我了，我们俩观赏着艾萨克和莫妮卡，这一对儿行动飞速，好像丝毫没有觉察到他们背靠着的是做礼拜的神圣之地。男孩的手从衬衫外面摸上女孩的胸部，毛手毛脚，手掌不动，但五指到处乱摸。我怀疑这感觉好不到哪儿去。看起来不像什么让人享受的事，但我决定原谅艾萨克，因为他就快失明了。感官若饥渴难耐，应当得到餍足。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Imagine taking that last drive to the hospital," I said quietly. "The last time you'll ever drive a car."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes, it's difficult to ascertain whether he is trying to arouse her or perform a breast exam." Then Augustus Waters reached into a pocket and pulled out, of all things, a pack of cigarettes. He flipped it open and put a cigarette between his lips.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊，很难确定他到底是想挑逗她还是想给她做乳腺检查。”然后，奥古斯塔斯伸手到口袋里，竟然掏出一包烟。他动作熟练地打开盒盖，将一根烟叼到嘴上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"A fatal flaw," I explained, turning away from him. I stepped toward the curb, leaving Augustus Waters behind me, and then I heard a car start down the street. It was Mom. She'd been waiting for me to, like, make friends or whatever.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“希腊悲剧中导致英雄人物毁灭的致命缺陷。”我解释完，转身走开，往马路牙子上走去，把奥古斯塔斯·沃特斯扔在身后，随后我听到街上有一辆车开了过来。那是妈妈。她一定是特意等着我，呃，结交朋友什么的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I felt this weird mix of disappointment and anger welling up inside of me. I don't even know what the feeling was, really, just that there was a lot of it, and I wanted to smack Augustus Waters and also replace my lungs with lungs that didn't suck at being lungs. I was standing with my Chuck Taylors on the very edge of the curb, the oxygen tank ball-and-chaining in the cart by my side, and right as my mom pulled up, I felt a hand grab mine.</div>

<div class="line_en">"They don't kill you unless you light them," he said as Mom arrived at the curb. "And I've never lit one. It's a metaphor, see: You put the killing thing right between your teeth, but you don't give it the power to do its killing."</div>
