<div class="line_en">The Saxon village, viewed from a distance and a certain height, would have been something more familiar to you as a "village" than Axl and Beatrice's warren. For one thing -- perhaps because the Saxons had a keener sense of claustrophobia -- there was none of this digging into the hillside. If you were coming down the steep valley slope, as Axl and Beatrice were that evening, you would have seen below you some forty or more individual houses, laid out on the valley floor in two rough circles, one within the other. You might have been too far away to notice the variations in size and splendour, but you would have made out the thatched roofs, and the fact that many were "roundhouses" not so far removed from the kind in which some of you, or perhaps your parents, were brought up. And if the Saxons were happy to sacrifice a little security for the benefits of open air, they were careful to compensate: a tall fence of tethered timber poles, their points sharpened like giant pencils, completely encircled the village. At any given point, the fence was at least twice a man's height, and to make the prospect of scaling it even less enticing, a deep trench followed it all the way around the outside.</div>

<div class="line_en">Axl was puzzled that a village which from a distance looked to be two orderly rings of houses could turn out to be such a chaotic labyrinth now they were walking through its narrow lanes. Admittedly the light was fading, but as he followed Beatrice, he could discern no logic or pattern to the place. Buildings would loom unexpectedly in front of them, blocking their way and forcing them down baffling side alleys. They were obliged, moreover, to walk with even more caution than out on the roads: not only was the ground pitted and full of puddles from the earlier storm, the Saxons seemed to find it acceptable to leave random objects, even pieces of rubble, lying in the middle of the path. But what troubled Axl most was the odour that grew stronger and fainter as they walked, but never went away. Like anyone of his time, he was well reconciled to the smell of excrement, human or animal, but this was something altogether more offensive. Before long he had determined its source: all over the village people had left out, on the fronts of houses or on the side of the street, piles of putrefying meat as offerings to their various gods. At one point, startled by a particularly strong assault, Axl had turned to see, suspended from the eaves of a hut, a dark object whose shape changed before his eyes as the colony of flies perched on it dispersed. A moment later they encountered a pig being dragged by its ears by a group of children; dogs, cows and donkeys under no one's supervision. The few people they met stared silently at them, or else quickly vanished behind a door or shutter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从远处看，这个村庄是两圈整洁有序的房子，但一走上村子里的小路，埃克索惊讶地发现，这儿成了混乱的迷宫。天色这会儿是快黑了，没错，可他跟在比特丽丝后面，看不出这地方有任何逻辑或规律。建筑物会突然从他眼前冒出来，挡住去路，他们只好走旁边那些令人疑惑的小胡同。这时候他们比在外面走大路时还要小心：之前下了暴雨，路上都是泥坑水洼；而且撒克逊人好像满不在乎地听凭各种各样的东西丢在路中间，甚至还有石块。但是，让埃克索最难受的，是那种难闻的气味，随着他们的脚步或强或弱，但一直都在。和当时的人们一样，他已经习惯了人畜粪便的气味，但这种气味要难闻得多。很快，他就发现了气味的来源：整个村子的人都把一堆堆的腐肉放在房子前面或道路旁边，作为给各种神祇的供奉。有一下子气味特别浓烈，埃克索转身去看，一幢小房子的屋檐下挂着一个黑色的东西，上面有一大堆苍蝇，苍蝇嗡一声飞走，那东西的形状顿时就不一样了。随后，他们又看到一群孩子拽着一头猪的耳朵；狗、牛、驴子，到处乱晃，没人看管。路上遇到的几个人，要么默默地盯着他们，要么快速消失在门或窗户后面。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Even as they were talking, they turned a corner into what appeared to be the village square. There was a bonfire blazing at its centre, and all around it, illuminated by its light, a large crowd. There were Saxons of all ages, even tiny children in their parents' arms, and Axl's first thought was that they had stumbled upon a pagan ceremony. But as they stopped to consider the scene before them, he saw there was no focus to the crowd's attention. The faces he could see were solemn, perhaps frightened. Voices were lowered, and collectively came through the air as a worried murmur. A dog barked at Axl and Beatrice and was promptly chased away by shadowy figures. Those among the crowd who noticed the visitors stared their way blankly before losing interest.</div>

<div class="line_en">As they moved towards a row of huts to their right, they became aware of many more people in the shadows, silently watching the crowd around the fire. Beatrice stopped to talk to one of them, a woman standing in front of her own door, and after a while Axl realised this was the medicine woman herself. He could not see her well in the near-darkness, but made out the straight-backed figure of a tall woman, probably in her middle years, clutching a shawl around her arms and shoulders. She and Beatrice went on conferring in low voices, sometimes glancing towards the crowd, sometimes at Axl. Eventually the woman gestured for them to enter her hut, but Beatrice, coming up to him, said softly:</div>

<div class="line_en">After the two women had gone inside, Axl felt a great weariness, especially in his shoulders and legs. Removing his own burden, he leaned against the turf wall behind him and gazed over at the crowd. There was now a growing restlessness: people would stride from the darkness around him to join the crowd while others hurried away from the fire, only to return a moment later. The blaze illuminated some faces sharply, while leaving others in shadow, but after a time, Axl came to the conclusion these people were all waiting, in a state of some anxiety, for someone or something to emerge from the timber hall to the left of the fire. This building, probably some meeting place for the Saxons, must have had a fire of its own burning inside, for its windows flickered between blackness and light.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两个女人进屋后，埃克索感到浑身疲乏，尤其是肩膀和腿。他取下自己的行囊，靠在身后的土墙上，看着人群。焦躁的情绪越来越浓：有些人从周围的黑暗中大步走出来，加入人群中，还有人匆匆忙忙从火堆旁离开，过一会儿又匆匆回来。火光照亮一些面孔，轮廓异常分明，另一些面孔则隐藏在暗处，可过了一会儿，埃克索发现，原来所有人都在焦虑地等待，等着什么人或什么事情从火堆左侧的木柱大厅里现身。这幢建筑很可能是撒克逊人聚会的地方，里面可能也烧着篝火，因为窗户里光亮摇曳，一明一暗。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was on the verge of nodding off, his back to the wall, the muffled voices of Beatrice and the medicine woman somewhere behind him, when the crowd surged and shifted, letting out a soft collective growl. Several men had emerged from the timber hall and were walking towards the fire. The crowd parted and quietened for them, as though in expectation of an announcement, but none came, and soon people were pressing around the newcomers, their voices building again. Axl noticed that attention was focused almost entirely on the man who had come out last from the hall. He was probably no more than thirty but had about him a natural authority. Although he was dressed simply, as a farmer might be, he did not look like anyone else in the village. It was not just the way he had swept his cloak over one shoulder, revealing his belt and the handle of his sword. Nor was it simply that his hair was longer than any of the villagers'-- it hung almost down to his shoulders and he had tied some of it with a thong to prevent it swaying over his eyes. In fact the actual thought that crossed Axl's mind was that this man had tied his hair to stop it falling across his vision during combat. This thought had come to Axl quite naturally, and only on reflection did it startle him, for it had carried with it an element of recognition. Moreover, when the stranger, striding into the midst of the crowd, allowed his hand to fall and rest on the sword handle, Axl had felt, almost tangibly, the peculiar mix of comfort, excitement and fear such a movement could bring. Telling himself he would return to these curious sensations at some later point, he shut them out of his mind and concentrated on the scene unfolding before him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他背靠着墙，比特丽丝和那个女药师的声音从身后什么地方隐约传来。他差点要开始打盹了，这时人群躁动起来，发出低低的喧闹声。几个人从木柱大厅里出来，朝火堆走去。人群分开，让他们通过，大家安静下来，好像是要等他们发布通告，但没有通告，很快人们就围了上去，声音又开始大起来。埃克索发现，人们的注意力几乎全部集中在最后从大厅里出来的那个人身上。他看上去不会超过三十岁，但有一种天生的威严。他穿着朴素，和农夫差不多，但和村里其他人都不一样。倒不仅仅是他的披风掀起来，搭在一侧的肩膀上，露出了腰带和剑柄。也不仅仅是因为他的头发比其他村民长——几乎一直垂到肩膀上，一部分用皮条扎住，以免挡住眼睛。实际上，埃克索真正想到的是，这个男人这样扎头发，是为了避免战斗时头发挡住视野。埃克索自然而然想到了这一点，但随后回想起来，他吃了一惊，因为这个念头里有似曾相识的成分。陌生人大步走到人群中间，一只手落在剑柄上，埃克索立即感觉到这个动作带来的独特感受：自得、兴奋、恐惧掺杂在一起。他暗暗告诉自己，这些奇怪的感受回头再说，现在不要去考虑，要注意眼前的事情。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was the bearing of the man, the way he moved and held himself, that so set him apart from those around him. "No matter that he tries to pass himself off as an ordinary Saxon," Axl thought, "this man is a warrior. And perhaps one capable of wreaking great devastation when he wishes it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个人的姿态，他移动和站立的样子，使他和周围的人大相径庭。“虽然这个人想假装成普通的撒克逊人，”埃克索心想，“但他的的确确是名武士。也许还是一名一旦起意，便能掀起狂澜的武士。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Two of the other men who had emerged from the hall were hovering nervously behind him, and whenever the warrior drifted further into the crowd, both men tried their best to stay near him, like children anxious not to be left behind by a parent. The two men, who were both young, also wore swords, and in addition, each was clutching a spear, but it was evident they were quite unaccustomed to such weapons. They were, moreover, stiff with fear and seemed unable to respond to the words of encouragement their fellow villagers were giving them. Their gazes darted about in panic even as hands patted their backs or squeezed their shoulders.</div>

<div class="line_en">"It seems earlier today one of the village men came back out of breath and his shoulder wounded, and when prevailed upon to calm himself told of how he and his brother, together with his nephew, a boy of twelve, were fishing at their usual spot by the river and were set upon by two ogres. Except according to this wounded man these were no ordinary ogres. Monstrous and able to move faster and with greater cunning than any ogre he'd ever seen. The fiends -- for it's by that name these villagers are talking of them -- the fiends killed his brother outright and carried off the boy, who was alive and struggling. The wounded man himself got away only after a long chase along the river path, the foul grunts coming closer behind him all the while, but he outran them in the end. That would be him there now, Axl, with the splint on his arm, talking to the stranger. Wounded though he was, he was anxious enough for his nephew to lead a party of this village's strongest men back to the spot, and they saw smoke from a campfire near the bank, and as they were creeping up to it, their weapons at the ready, the bushes opened and it seems these same two fiends had set a trap. The medicine woman says three men were killed even before the others thought to run for their lives, and though they returned unhurt, most of them are now shivering and muttering to themselves in their beds, too shaken to come out and wish well these brave men willing to go out now, even with the darkness coming and the mist setting in, to do what couldn't be done by twelve strong men in broad daylight."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“看来事情是这样的：今天早些时候，村里一个人气喘吁吁地跑回来，肩膀受了伤，大家让他平静下来，他才说明了原委。他和他的哥哥，还有他侄子，在河边的老地方钓鱼，碰到了两个食人兽。不过，根据肩膀受伤的这个人的说法，这可不是一般的食人兽。大得吓人，比他见过的食人兽速度更快，也更狡猾。两个魔鬼——村子里的人现在谈起来，都是这么称呼它们的——当场就杀死了他哥哥，抓走了男孩，男孩还活着，挣扎不休。受伤的男人沿着河边小道逃跑，身后粗重恶心的气息越来越近，不过最后他还是甩掉了它，保住了性命。你看那边那个应该就是他，埃克索，胳膊上绑着木条，正在跟那个陌生人说话。他虽然受了伤，却急着让侄子领着村子里最强壮的男人回到那个地方。他们在河边看到了篝火的烟，就在他们准备好武器，悄悄爬过去的时候，灌木丛里突然闯出那两个魔鬼来，看来它们预先布置好了陷阱。女药师说，大家还没想到逃命，就已经有三个人死了，其他人都回来了，没有受伤，但大多躲在床上瑟瑟发抖、胡言乱语，吓得都不敢出来祝福这几个打算此刻出发的勇士。虽然天快黑了，迷雾即将来临，这些勇敢的人仍要去完成十二个健壮的人白天都无法完成的事情。”">查看中文翻译</div>

After the first party returned in terror, for all the urging of the elders, there was not a single man brave enough to join a further expedition. Then as fortune would have it, here's this stranger come into the village seeking a night's shelter after his horse has hurt a foot. And though he knows nothing of this boy or his family before today, he's declared himself willing to come to the village's aid.

<div class="line_en">But just at that moment the crowd made a sudden noise, then the noise became cheering, and the crowd shifted again, as if struggling to change shape. Then it began to move, the warrior and his two companions near its centre. A low chanting started up, and soon the spectators in the shadows -- the medicine woman included -- joined in. The procession came towards them, and though the brightness of the fire had been left behind, several torches were moving within it, so that Axl could catch glimpses of faces, some frightened, some excited. Whenever a torch illuminated the warrior, his expression was calm, gazing to left and right to acknowledge words of encouragement, his hand once more on the handle of his sword. They went past Axl and Beatrice, continued between a row of huts and out of view, though the muted chanting remained audible for some time.</div>

<div class="line_en">They finally set off for their lodgings only when quiet had descended over the village. It was harder than ever to find one's way in the darkness, and the occasional torches burning on corners seemed only to increase the confusion with their shadows. They were proceeding in the opposite direction to that in which the crowd had gone, and the houses they passed were dark with no obvious signs of life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等整个村庄安静下来，他们才动身到过夜的地方去。在黑暗中找路更加困难了，角落里偶有点着的火把，投下黑影重重，只会增加混乱。他们走的路，和人群行进的方向相反，经过的房子里都是漆黑的，没有明显的生命迹象。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In time the path straightened and they found themselves walking beside the perimeter fence they had seen from the hill. Its sharpened poles loomed above them a shade darker than the night sky, and as they went on, Axl could hear murmured voices somewhere above them. Then he saw they were no longer alone: high up along the ramparts, at regular intervals, were shapes he realised were people gazing out over the fence into the dark wilderness beyond. He had barely time to share this observation with Beatrice before they heard footsteps gathering behind them. They quickened their pace, but now a torch was moving nearby and shadows swung rapidly before them. At first Axl thought they had stumbled upon a group of villagers coming in the other direction, but then saw that he and Beatrice were entirely surrounded. Saxon men of varying ages and builds, some with spears, others wielding hoes, scythes and other tools, were jostling around them. Several voices addressed them at once, and ever more people seemed to be arriving. Axl felt the heat of the torches thrust at their faces, and holding Beatrice close to him, tried to locate with his gaze the leader of this group, but could find no such figure. Every face, moreover, was filled with panic, and he realised any careless move could bring disaster. He pulled Beatrice out of the reach of a particularly wild-eyed young man who had raised a trembling knife in the air, and searched his memory for some Saxon phrases. When nothing came to him, he made do with a few soothing noises, such as he might have made to an unruly horse.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过了一会儿，路变直了，他们发现路旁就是在山上曾看到的防御围篱。那尖尖的木桩在他们上方，比夜晚的天空还要黑。两人往前走的时候，埃克索能听到头顶上方有窃窃私语声。接着他看见了其他人，都在上面，沿着防御墙有规律地排列着，从围篱上方盯着外面黑暗的荒野。他还没来得及告诉比特丽丝他发现的情况，就听到背后传来急匆匆的脚步声，他们加快了脚步，可这时候旁边已经有个移动的火把，他们身前人影晃动。一开始，埃克索以为碰到了从对面来的一帮村民，但随即发现自己和比特丽丝已被团团围住。不同年龄和体形的撒克逊人挤了上来，有些拿着长矛，有些挥舞着锄头、镰刀等工具。几个声音同时跟他们讲话，好像还有更多人陆续赶来。埃克索感到火把的热度扑面而来，他把比特丽丝抱得紧一点，目光凝视周围，看能不能找出带头的人，但没找到。而且，每张面孔都神色慌张，他意识到，任何鲁莽动作，都可能导致灾难。一个眼神疯狂的年轻人已经哆哆嗦嗦把刀举在空中，埃克索把比特丽丝拉过来，离刀锋远点儿，脑子里回想着他会说的那几句撒克逊话。他什么都没想起来，只好发出几声安慰的声音，就像对付一匹不听话的马那样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Stop that, Axl," Beatrice whispered. "They won't thank you for singing lullabies to them." She addressed one, then another of the men in Saxon, but the mood did not improve. Shouted arguments were breaking out, and a dog, tugging on a rope, broke through the ranks to snarl at them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“算啦，埃克索，”比特丽丝低声说。“他们不会感谢你给他们唱催眠曲的。”她用撒克逊语先跟一个人讲话，然后又对另一个人讲，但气氛并没有改善。人们开始叫喊、争辩，一条狗拽着绳子，从队列里窜出来，冲他们恶狠狠地叫。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then the tense figures around them seemed all at once to sag. Their voices quietened till there was only the one, shouting angrily, somewhere still a little way off.

<div class="line_cn" title="突然，周围紧张的人们一下子松懈下来。他们的声音低下去，最后只能听到一个声音，在不远处愤怒地叫喊。声音越来越近，人群分开，一个身材粗短、身形扭曲的人拄着一根粗拐杖，拖着脚步走到火把的光亮下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was quite elderly, and though his back was relatively straight, his neck and head protruded from his shoulders at a grotesque angle. Nonetheless all present appeared to yield to his authority -- the dog too ceased barking and vanished into the shadows. Even with his limited Saxon, Axl could tell the misshapen man's fury had only partly to do with the villagers' treatment of strangers: they were being reprimanded for abandoning their sentry posts, and the faces caught in the torchlight became crestfallen, though filled with confusion. Then as the elder's voice rose to a new level of anger, the men seemed slowly to remember something, and one by one slipped back into the night. But even when the last of them had gone, and there were sounds of feet clambering up ladders, the misshapen man went on hurling insults after them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他年纪很大，虽然脊梁挺得比较直，脖子和脑袋却以奇怪的角度从肩上伸出来。但是，所有在场的人似乎都服从他的权威——连那条狗都不叫了，躲进了黑暗中。埃克索对撒克逊语所知有限，但他仍能听出来，这个身形扭曲的人勃然大怒，倒不仅仅是因为村民们对陌生人不友好：他在批评他们擅自离开哨岗。火光下的脸孔都神情沮丧，虽然仍旧疑惑。接着，长者的声音更高、更愤怒了，人们似乎也慢慢想起了什么事情，一个一个悄悄回到了黑暗中。等到最后一个人也已经离开，周围响起攀爬梯子的声音，这个身形扭曲的老人仍在背后责骂不休。">查看中文翻译</div>

The fire was smouldering in the centre of the room, surrounded by woven rugs, animal skins and furniture crafted from oak and ash.

There were many more torches lit now, some blazing from the ramparts, making it much easier than before to see one's way. People were moving everywhere, dogs barking and children crying. Then some order seemed to impose itself, and Axl and Beatrice found themselves in a procession hurrying in a single direction. They came to an abrupt halt, and Axl was surprised to see they were already at the central square -- there was obviously a more direct route from Ivor's house than the one they had taken earlier. The bonfire was blazing more fiercely than ever, so much so that Axl thought for an instant it was its heat that had caused the villagers to stop. But looking past the rows of heads, he saw the warrior had returned. He was standing there quite calmly, to the left of the fire, one side of his figure illuminated, the other in shadow. The visible part of his face was covered in what Axl recognised as tiny spots of blood, as if he had just come walking through a fine mist of the stuff. His long hair, though still tied, had come loose and looked wet. His clothes were covered in mud and perhaps blood, and the cloak he had nonchalantly flung over his shoulder at his departure was now torn in several places. But the man himself appeared uninjured, and he was now talking quietly to three of the village elders, Ivor among them. Axl could see too that the warrior was holding some object in the crook of his arm.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="与此同时，人们开始吟唱，一开始声音很轻，然后越来越大，最后武士转过身去，向人群致意，没有一点儿粗鲁骄横的样子。他开始对人们讲话，尽管声音够响，大家都能听到，但给人的印象是，他在用低沉、亲密的语调谈论严肃的话题。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His listeners hushed to catch each word, and soon he was drawing from them gasps of approval or of horror. At one point he gestured to a spot behind him and Axl noticed for the first time, sitting on the ground just within the circle of light, the two men who had gone out with the warrior. They looked as if they had fallen there from a height and were too dazed to get up. The crowd started up a chant for them, but the pair seemed not to notice, continuing instead to stare at the air before them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="听众们安静下来，努力去听他说的每个字，不久人们便张大了嘴巴，要么表示赞许，要么感到震惊。有一下，他朝身旁的一个地方做了个手势，埃克索第一次看到，和武士一起出发的那两个人正坐在地上，也在火光照亮的光圈之内。他们看起来好像是从高处跌落了下来，现在还头晕目眩，站不起身来。人们开始为这两人吟唱，但他们似乎没注意到，眼睛仍旧空洞地瞪着前方。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The warrior then turned back to the crowd and said something which caused the chanting to fade. He stepped closer to the fire, and grasping in one hand the object he had been carrying, raised it into the air.</div>

<div class="line_en">Axl saw what appeared to be the head of a thick-necked creature severed just below the throat. Dark curls of hair hung down from the crown to frame an eerily featureless face: where the eyes, nose and mouth should have been there was only pimpled flesh, like that of a goose, with a few tufts of down-like hair on the cheeks. A growl escaped the crowd and Axl felt it cower back. Only then did he realise that what they were looking at was not a head at all, but a section of the shoulder and upper arm of some abnormally large, human-like creature. The warrior was, in fact, holding up his trophy by the stump close to the bicep with the shoulder end uppermost, and in that moment Axl saw that what he had taken for strands of hair were entrails dangling out of the cut by which the segment had been separated from the body.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃克索看到，那似乎是个动物的脑袋，脖子很粗，从咽喉下方切下来。黑色的卷毛从头顶挂下来，披在脸部周围，那张脸没有五官、怪诞可怖：本来应该有眼睛、鼻子和嘴巴的地方，只有长着很多小疙瘩的肉，像鹅的瘤一样，脸颊上有几丛绒毛一样的毛发。人群里发出一声惊叫，埃克索感觉到大家在往后退。这时候他才意识到，大家看到的不是脑袋，而是一个大得异常的人形怪物的肩臂部位。武士举起战利品时，抓着的是二头肌附近的残根，肩膀那头朝着最上方，这时埃克索看到，这一块东西被剑从身体上砍下，他原来以为是一缕缕毛发的东西，实际上是肌腱从伤口里钻了出来，挂在外面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After only a short time, the warrior lowered his trophy and let it fall at his feet, as though he could now barely work up sufficient contempt for the creature's remains. For a second time, the crowd recoiled, before edging forward again, and then the chanting started up once more. But this time it died almost instantly for the warrior was speaking again, and though Axl could understand none of it, he could sense palpably the nervous excitement around him. Beatrice said in his ear:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过了一会儿，武士把战利品放下来，丢在脚下，好像他无法充分表达对怪物躯体的鄙视一样。人们又一次缩回去，然后又挤上前，吟唱声再次响起，但这次马上就停止了，因为武士又开始讲话。埃克索一句也听不懂，但能明显感觉到周围人们的紧张、激动。比特丽丝在他耳边说：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Almost beyond the light of the fire a small group of women had huddled around a thin, dark-haired youth seated on a stone. He was already close to a man's height, but one sensed that beneath the blanket now wrapped around him, he still had the gangly frame of a boy. One woman had brought out a bucket and was washing off the grime from his face and neck, but he seemed oblivious. His eyes were fixed on the warrior's back just in front of him, though intermittently he would angle his head to one side, as though trying to peer around the warrior's legs at the thing on the ground.</div>

<div class="line_en">Axl was surprised that the sight of the rescued child, alive and evidently without serious injury, provoked in him neither relief nor joy, but a vague unease. He supposed at first this was to do with the odd manner of the boy himself, but then it occurred to him what was really wrong: there was something amiss in the way this boy, whose safety had until so recently been at the centre of the community's concerns, was now being received. There was a reserve, almost a coldness, that reminded Axl of that incident involving the girl Marta in his own village, and he wondered if this boy, like her, was in the process of being forgotten. But surely this could not be the case here. People were even now pointing at the boy, and the women attending him were staring back defensively.</div>

<div class="line_en">The warrior was still addressing the crowd, and a tone of entreaty had entered his voice. It was almost as if he was making an accusation, and Axl could feel the mood of the crowd changing. The sense of awe and gratitude was giving way to some other emotion, and there was confusion, even fear in the rumble of voices swelling around him. The warrior spoke again, his voice stern, gesturing behind him towards the boy. Then Ivor came within the light of the fire and standing beside the warrior said something which drew a less inhibited growl of protest from parts of his audience. A voice behind Axl shouted something, then arguments were breaking out on all sides. Ivor raised his voice and for a small moment there was quiet, but almost straight away the shouting resumed, and now there was jostling in the shadows.</div>

The boy had not changed his position, and was still staring at the warrior's back, apparently unaware of the commotion before him.

This door -- it would have been a "proper" door on wooden hinges -- made a creaking noise and the sun entered powerfully through the gap, but still Beatrice slept on.

<div class="line_en">A little later, having made themselves presentable as best they could -- and with Ivor still not returned -- they wandered out into the crisp, bright air in search of something to eat.

The round huts which in the dark had seemed so haphazardly positioned now stood before them in neat rows, their matching shadows forming an orderly avenue through the village. There was a bustle of men and women moving about with tools or washing tubs, groups of children following in their wake. The dogs, though numerous as ever, seemed docile. Only a donkey contentedly defecating in the sun right in front of a well reminded Axl of the unruly place he had entered the night before. There were even nods and subdued greetings from villagers as they passed, though no one went so far as to speak to them.</div>

<div class="line_en">Once inside it, you would not have thought this longhouse so different from the sort of rustic canteen many of you will have experienced in one institution or another. There were rows of long tables and benches, and towards one end, a kitchen and serving area. Its main difference from a modern facility would have been the dominating presence of hay: there was hay above one's head, and beneath one's feet, and though not by design, all over the surface of the tables, blown around by the gusts that regularly swept through the place. On a morning such as this, as our travellers sat down to breakfast, the sun breaking in through the porthole-like windows would have revealed the air itself to be filled with drifting specks of hay.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一走进去，你很可能会觉得，长屋和你在某些情况下亲眼见过的那种乡村食堂差不多。屋里有一排排的长桌和板凳，一端是厨房和提供食物的区域。和现代设施的主要差别是，这儿到处都是干草：头顶、脚下都有草，桌面上也有，不过不是有意为之——长屋里经常有风，草被刮得到处都是。这样的上午，就在我们的客人们坐下来准备吃早饭时，阳光从小小的窗户里照进来，你会发现就连空气里都飘着细小的干草粒。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Before long they came to a sunny courtyard. There were roaming geese, and the yard itself was bisected by an artificial stream -- a shallow channel cut into the earth -- along which the water trickled with urgency. At its broadest point the stream was forded by a simple little bridge of two flat rocks, and at that moment an older child was squatting on one of them, washing clothes. It was a scene that struck Axl as almost idyllic, and he would have paused to take it in further had Ivor not kept striding firmly on towards the low, heavily thatched building whose length ran the entire far edge of the yard.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不久，他们来到一个洒满阳光的庭院，鹅在院子里走来走去。院子一分为二，中间有一条人工小溪——地上挖出来的一道水渠，渠里水不深，但流得急。小溪最宽的地方，有一座简单的小桥，用两块石板搭成，一个大孩子正蹲在石板上洗衣服。埃克索觉得这个场景近乎田园风光，他想停下来好好欣赏一番，可艾弗一直大步向前，朝着那幢低矮的建筑走去，建筑位于院子的远端，与院子同宽，屋顶盖着厚厚的茅草。">查看中文翻译</div>

The boy Edwin was safely returned, but even as the village began to rejoice, the women found on him a small wound. I inspected it myself as did the other elders. A mark just below his chest, no worse than what a child receives after a tumble. But the women, his own kin at that, declared it a bite, and that's what the village is calling it this morning. I've had to have the boy locked in a shed for his safety, and even so, his companions, his very family members, throwing stones at the door and calling for him to be brought out and slaughtered."</div>

<div class="line_en">The view before them that morning may not have differed so greatly from one to be had from the high windows of an English country house today. The two men would have seen, to their right, the valleyside coming down in regular green ridges, while far to their left, the opposite slope, covered with pine trees, would have appeared hazier, because more distant, as it merged with the outlines of the mountains on the horizon. Directly before them was a clear view along the valley floor; of the river curving gently as it followed the corridor out of view; of the expanses of marshland broken by patches of pond and lake further in the distance. There would have been elms and willows near the water, as well as dense woodland, which in those days would have stirred a sense of foreboding. And just where the sunlight went into shadow on the left bank of the river could be seen some remnants of a long-abandoned village.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天上午他们眼前的风景，和今天英国乡村房子的高窗前看到的景观，可能不会有很大差别。这两个人应该能看到，他们的右边是渐次而下的谷坡，每隔一段距离就有绿色的山脊，他们的左边是对面的谷坡，长满了松树，应该显得更朦胧一些，因为更远，与地平线上群山的轮廓融为一体。他们的正前方，则是一望无垠的谷底，一条河流在谷底蜿蜒，直到尽头，更远处则是无边无际的沼泽地，布满一块块的池塘和湖泊。水边应该有榆树和柳树，还有浓密的林地，那时候应该会给人们带来不祥的感觉。河的右岸，在阳光和阴影的交汇处，能看到一处早已废弃的村庄。">查看中文翻译</div>

I knew nothing of this boy before last night, but I've been impressed by the steady way he has faced each new terror set before him. My comrades last night, brave though they were when setting out, were overcome with fear as we approached the fiends' camp. The boy, however, even though left at the fiends' mercy for many hours, held himself with a calm I could only wonder at. It would pain me greatly to think his fate's now all but sealed. So I've been thinking of a way out, and if you and your good wife were to consent to lend a hand, all may yet be well."</div>

<div class="line_en">"When the elders asked me to take the boy to a distant village, they meant no doubt a Saxon village. But it's precisely in a Saxon village the boy will never be safe, for it is Saxons who share this superstition about the bite he carries. If he were to be left with Britons, however, who see such nonsense for what it is, there can be no danger, even if the story were to pursue him. He's strong, and as I've said, has remarkable courage, even if he speaks little. He'll be a useful pair of hands for any community from the day he arrives. Now, sir, you said earlier you're on your way east to your son's village. I take it this will be just such a Christian village as we seek. If you and your wife were to plead for him, with perhaps the support of your son, that would surely secure a good outcome. Of course, it may be the same good people would accept the boy from me, but then I'll be a stranger to them, and one to arouse fear and suspicion. What's more, the errand which has brought me to this country will prevent my travelling so far east."</div>
