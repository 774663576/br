<div class="line_en">A fire mutt knows only a single sensation: agony. No sight, no sound, no feeling except the unrelenting burning of flesh. Perhaps there are periods of unconsciousness, but what can it matter if I can't find refuge in them? I am Cinna's bird, ignited, flying frantically to escape something inescapable. The feathers of flame that grow from my body. Beating my wings only fans the blaze. I consume myself, but to no end.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the dazzling white Capitol hospital, the doctors work their magic on me. Draping my rawness in new sheets of skin. Coaxing the cells into thinking they are my own. Manipulating my body parts, bending and stretching the limbs to assure a good fit. I hear over and over again how lucky I am. My eyes were spared. Most of my face was spared. My lungs are responding to treatment. I will be as good as new.</div>

<div class="line_en">Foam. I really am floating on foam. I can feel it beneath the tips of my fingers, cradling parts of my naked body. There's much pain but there's also something like reality. The sandpaper of my throat. The smell of burn medicine from the first arena. The sound of my mother's voice. These things frighten me, and I try to return to the deep to make sense of them. But there's no going back. Gradually, I'm forced to accept who I am. A badly burned girl with no wings. With no fire. And no sister.</div>

<div class="line_en">The doctors' puzzlement grows over why I'm unable to speak. Many tests are done, and while there's damage to my vocal cords, it doesn't account for it. Finally, Dr. Aurelius, a head doctor, comes up with the theory that I've become a mental, rather than physical, Avox. That my silence has been brought on by emotional trauma. Although he's presented with a hundred proposed remedies, he tells them to leave me alone. So I don't ask about anyone or anything, but people bring me a steady stream of information. On the war: The Capitol fell the day the parachutes went off, President Coin leads Panem now, and troops have been sent out to put down the small remaining pockets of Capitol resistance. On President Snow: He's being held prisoner, awaiting trial and most certain execution. On my assassination team: Cressida and Pollux have been sent out into the districts to cover the wreckage of the war. Gale, who took two bullets in an escape attempt, is mopping up Peacekeepers in 2. Peeta's still in the burn unit. He made it to the City Circle after all. On my family: My mother buries her grief in her work.</div>

<div class="line_en">Eventually, I'm released from the hospital and given a room in the president's mansion to share with my mother. She's almost never there, taking her meals and sleeping at work. It falls to Haymitch to check on me, make sure I'm eating and using my medicines. It's not an easy job. I take to my old habits from District 13. Wandering unauthorized through the mansion. Into bedrooms and offices, ballrooms and baths. Seeking strange little hiding spaces. A closet of furs. A cabinet in the library. A long-forgotten bathtub in a room of discarded furniture. My places are dim and quiet and impossible to find. I curl up, make myself smaller, try to disappear entirely. Wrapped in silence, I slide my bracelet that reads MEntally DIsoriented around and around my wrist.</div>

<div class="line_en">Periodically, I find myself back in my room, unsure whether I was driven by a need for morphling or if Haymitch ferreted me out. I eat the food, take the medicine, and am required to bathe. It's not the water I mind, but the mirror that reflects my naked fire-mutt body. The skin grafts still retain a newborn-baby pinkness. The skin deemed damaged but salvageable looks red, hot, and melted in places. Patches of my former self gleam white and pale. I'm like a bizarre patchwork quilt of skin. Parts of my hair were singed off completely; the rest has been chopped off at odd lengths. Katniss Everdeen, the girl who was on fire. I wouldn't much care except the sight of my body brings back the memory of the pain. And why I was in pain. And what happened just before the pain started. And how I watched my little sister become a human torch.</div>

<div class="line_en">Late one afternoon, after a long period in a cushioned window seat behind a painted screen, I emerge and turn left instead of right. I find myself in a strange part of the mansion, and immediately lose my bearings. Unlike the area where I'm quartered, there seems to be no one around to ask. I like it, though. Wish I'd found it sooner. It's so quiet, with the thick carpets and heavy tapestries soaking up the sound. Softly lit. Muted colors. Peaceful. Until I smell the roses. I dive behind some curtains, shaking too hard to run, while I await the mutts. Finally, I realize there are no mutts coming. So, what do I smell? Real roses? Could it be that I am near the garden where the evil things grow?</div>

<div class="line_en">At the end of a short hallway, I push apart the glass doors and step inside. By now the smell's so strong that it begins to flatten out, as if there's no more my nose can absorb. The damp, mild air feels good on my hot skin. And the roses are glorious. Row after row of sumptuous blooms, in lush pink, sunset orange, and even pale blue. I wander through the aisles of carefully pruned plants, looking but not touching, because I have learned the hard way how deadly these beauties can be. I know when I find it, crowning the top of a slender bush. A magnificent white bud just beginning to open. I pull my left sleeve over my hand so that my skin won't actually have to touch it, take up a pair of pruning shears, and have just positioned them on the stem when he speaks.</div>

He holds a white handkerchief spotted with fresh blood. Even in his deteriorated state, his snake eyes shine bright and cold. "I was hoping you'd find your way to my quarters."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我还是看不见他，那声音似乎是从红色玫瑰花床的对面传来的。我小心地把花枝子穿透袖口的衣服纤维，别在那里。然后慢慢地走过转角，结果看到他坐在靠墙的一张凳子上。他的衣着如平时一样地整洁，只不过手腕和脚腕上都戴着镣铐，身上还有追踪器。在明亮的光线下，他肤色惨白，甚至透着病态的铅灰色。他手里拿着一块白手绢，上面沾着点点的鲜血。即使在这种狼狈不堪的境地，他的蛇一样的眼睛仍放着犀利的寒光。“我正在想你可能会找到我住的地方。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His quarters. I have trespassed into his home, the way he slithered into mine last year, hissing threats with his bloody, rosy breath. This greenhouse is one of his rooms, perhaps his favorite; perhaps in better times he tended the plants himself. But now it's part of his prison. That's why the guards halted me. And that's why Paylor let me in.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他住的地方。我已经踏入他的住处，正如他去年悄无声息地闯入我的家，带着他那血腥的、玫瑰花的气息，不动声色地威胁我一样。这个温室是他的房间之一，也许是他最喜欢的；弄不好在他闲暇时，还会自己照料这些植物。但现在这里成了囚禁他的地方，这就是士兵拦住我的原因。也是出于同样的原因，佩拉让我进来了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Even in my deadened, drugged condition, this sends a stab of pain through me. Reminding me that there are no limits to his cruelty. And how he will go to his grave trying to destroy me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然我现在一直在服用镇静剂，但他的话仍让我感到一阵刺痛，这使我想起他的残忍是没有极限的，他在进坟墓之前一定还要伤害我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There are so many things we should discuss, but I have a feeling your visit will be brief. So, first things first." He begins to cough, and when he removes the handkerchief from his mouth, it's redder. "I wanted to tell you how very sorry I am about your sister."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我觉得咱们有很多事要讨论，但我有种感觉你在这儿待得不会太长，那么咱们就说最主要的吧。”他开始咳嗽，当他把手绢拿开时，手绢更红了，“我想告诉你我为你妹妹的事感到非常遗憾。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"So wasteful, so unnecessary. Anyone could see the game was over by that point. In fact, I was just about to issue an official surrender when they released those parachutes." His eyes are glued on me, unblinking, so as not to miss a second of my reaction. But what he's said makes no sense. When they released the parachutes? "Well, you really didn't think I gave the order, did you? Forget the obvious fact that if I'd had a working hovercraft at my disposal, I'd have been using it to make an escape. But that aside, what purpose could it have served? We both know I'm not above killing children, but I'm not wasteful. I take life for very specific reasons. And there was no reason for me to destroy a pen full of Capitol children. None at all."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“太可惜，太没必要了。任何人都看得出那时游戏已经结束了。事实上，他们放下降落伞时，我正准备签署正式的投降书。”他用眼睛死死地盯着我，眼睛连眨都不眨，恐怕错过我脸上的每一个细微反应。但他说得没有道理。当他们放下降落伞时？“哦，你不会以为是我下的命令，是吧？你忘了一个显著的事实，如果我有直升机，一定用它来逃跑。除此之外，它还能干什么？我们都知道，我并非不会杀死孩子，但我是不会浪费的。我夺取生命是有特殊原因的。我没有理由杀死一群圈起来的凯匹特的孩子。根本不会。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I'd supposed he would be secured in the deepest dungeon that the Capitol had to offer, not cradled in the lap of luxury. Yet Coin left him here. To set a precedent, I guess. So that if in the future she ever fell from grace, it would be understood that presidents -- even the most despicable -- get special treatment. Who knows, after all, when her own power might fade?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我本想他会被关在凯匹特最深的地牢里，而不是环境奢华的房间。但科恩却把他放在这里。这确实是开了一个先例，我猜。这样，如果以后她失去了原来的地位，人们也会认为总统——即使是最可鄙的家伙——也会受到特殊待遇。无论怎样，谁知道她什么时候会失势呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I'm not with Snow now. I'm in Special Weaponry back in 13 with Gale and Beetee. Looking at the designs based on Gale's traps. That played on human sympathies. The first bomb killed the victims. The second, the rescuers. Remembering Gale's words.</div>

<div class="line_en">"However, I must concede it was a masterful move on Coin's part. The idea that I was bombing our own helpless children instantly snapped whatever frail allegiance my people still felt to me. There was no real resistance after that. Did you know it aired live? You can see Plutarch's hand there. And in the parachutes. Well, it's that sort of thinking that you look for in a Head Gamemaker, isn't it?" Snow dabs the corners of his mouth. "I'm sure he wasn't gunning for your sister, but these things happen."</div>

<div class="line_en">"My failure," says Snow, "was being so slow to grasp Coin's plan. To let the Capitol and districts destroy one another, and then step in to take power with Thirteen barely scratched. Make no mistake, she was intending to take my place right from the beginning. I shouldn't be surprised. After all, it was Thirteen that started the rebellion that led to the Dark Days, and then abandoned the rest of the districts when the tide turned against it. But I wasn't watching Coin. I was watching you, Mockingjay. And you were watching me. I'm afraid we have both been played for fools."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我的失败就是没能及时掌握科恩的计划，”斯诺接着说，“去让凯匹特和各辖区相互残杀，最后十三区可以毫发无伤地夺取政权。如果我没说错的话，从一开始她就计划代替我的位置。我并不感到吃惊。不管怎么说，正是十三区策动的反叛才导致黑暗时期的来临，然后在大势已去时，又抛弃了其他的辖区。但我的注意力不在科恩身上，而在你嘲笑鸟的身上。而你的注意力也都在我身上。恐怕我们两个人都让人耍了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
