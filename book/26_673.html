<div class="line_en">The next day, after lessons, Mrs. Grose found a moment to say to me quietly: "Have you written, miss?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Meanwhile there had been, on the part of my pupils, no more brilliant, more exemplary morning. It was exactly as if they had both had at heart to gloss over any recent little friction. They performed the dizziest feats of arithmetic, soaring quite out of MY feeble range, and perpetrated, in higher spirits than ever, geographical and historical jokes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="同时，对于我的学生们来说，没有比这更明媚、更典型的清晨了。他们两人好像发自内心地想掩饰近来的小摩擦。他们表演了最炫目的算术特技，远远超出了我的能力范围，另外，他们还兴致勃勃地闹出一些关于地理和历史的笑话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was conspicuous of course in Miles in particular that he appeared to wish to show how easily he could let me down. This child, to my memory, really lives in a setting of beauty and misery that no words can translate; there was a distinction all his own in every impulse he revealed; never was a small natural creature, to the uninitiated eye all frankness and freedom, a more ingenious, a more extraordinary little gentleman.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="很明显，当然特别是迈尔斯，他好像希望能显示出他能多么容易地使我感到安静下来。在我的记忆中，这个孩子确实是生活在一个美好和苦恼共存的环境中，无法用言语描述。他的每一次冲动都会展现出不同的他。从那双充满坦诚与自由的天真的眼睛看，没有哪一个自然的小生灵能像他一样是如此机灵、如此非凡的小绅士。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I had perpetually to guard against the wonder of contemplation into which my initiated view betrayed me; to check the irrelevant gaze and discouraged sigh in which I constantly both attacked and renounced the enigma of what such a little gentleman could have done that deserved a penalty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我不得不始终提防着不要让那背叛了我的初始印象将我引入沉思，他那不切主题的凝视和气馁的叹息，让我经常攻击或者宣布放弃研究那个谜团，这样一个小绅士会做了什么让他受到惩罚的事？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He had never, at any rate, been such a little gentleman as when, after our early dinner on this dreadful day, he came round to me and asked if I shouldn't like him, for half an hour, to play to me. David playing to Saul could never have shown a finer sense of the occasion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有天过的很无聊，在我们早早地吃完正餐后，迈尔斯围着我问我是否愿意让他为我表演半个小时，无论如何，他从未如此像个小绅士。即使大卫给索尔的表演，也不可能有现在这么精彩的场面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Say that, by the dark prodigy I knew, the imagination of all evil HAD been opened up to him: all the justice within me ached for the proof that it could ever have flowered into an act.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就是说，从这个我认识的忧郁神童身上，我得知，世间的邪恶之门已向他敞开，我内心的全部正义感渴望得到这曾发展成为事实的证据。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was literally a charming exhibition of tact, of magnanimity, and quite tantamount to his saying outright: "The true knights we love to read about never push an advantage too far. I know what you mean now: you mean that -- to be let alone yourself and not followed up -- you'll cease to worry and spy upon me, won't keep me so close to you, will let me go and come. Well, I 'come,' you see -- but I don't go! There'll be plenty of time for that. I do really delight in your society, and I only want to show you that I contended for a principle."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这简直就是机智和高贵的精彩展示，正如他坦言：“真正让我们津津乐道的骑士，从不过分展现自己的长处。现在我明白你的意思了：你的意思是——要独处而没人跟随——你要停止为我担心，不再监视我，不会让我靠你太近，让我来去自如。好，我‘来’了，你看见了——但我不会走的！会有充足的时间让我离开。我真的喜欢你的陪伴，我只想向你表明，我在为一个原则而斗争。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It may be imagined whether I resisted this appeal or failed to accompany him again, hand in hand, to the schoolroom. He sat down at the old piano and played as he had never played; and if there are those who think he had better have been kicking a football I can only say that I wholly agree with them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可以想象，不管我能否抵制住他的这个请求，或是我又不能陪他，我们还是手拉着手往教室走去。他在旧钢琴旁坐下来，像以前从没弹过一样地弹琴，如果有人认为他还不如去踢足球，我完全赞成。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was after luncheon, and by the schoolroom fire, and yet I hadn't really, in the least, slept: I had only done something much worse -- I had forgotten. Where, all this time, was Flora? When I put the question to Miles, he played on a minute before answering and then could only say: "Why, my dear, how do I know?" -- Breaking moreover into a happy laugh which, immediately after, as if it were a vocal accompaniment, he prolonged into incoherent, extravagant song.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正餐后，在教室的炉火旁，我毫无睡意，我只是做了更加糟糕的事情——我已经忘记了。在这段时间里，弗洛拉在哪里呢？当我问迈尔斯这个问题时，他继续弹了一会儿，然后才回答，他只是说：“哎呀，我亲爱的，我怎么知道呢？”之后他高兴地大笑起来，紧接着，好像是伴音，他拉长嗓音，不连贯地、放纵地唱着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For at the end of a time that under his influence I had quite ceased to measure, I started up with a strange sense of having literally slept at my post.</div>

<div class="line_en">As she was nowhere about she would surely be with Mrs. Grose, whom, in the comfort of that theory, I accordingly proceeded in quest of.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="既然哪里都不见她，她一定是和格罗斯太太在一起。在这个想法的安慰下，我就前去找格罗斯太太了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This we promptly arranged between us; but when, ten minutes later and in pursuance of our arrangement, we met in the hall, it was only to report on either side that after guarded inquiries we had altogether failed to trace her. For a minute there, apart from observation, we exchanged mute alarms, and I could feel with what high interest my friend returned me all those I had from the first given her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我俩立马分头行动，但当我们找了十分钟后在门厅碰头时，经过仔细询问，我俩都被告知，没人知道弗洛拉的行踪。在那一刻，除了相互注视，我们还沉默地交换了惊慌的眼神。我能感觉出我的朋友把我一开始传递给她的紧张情绪，又传回给了我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Of course now indeed she might be with the maids, so that the immediate thing was to look for her without an air of alarm.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，现在她可能就是跟女仆们在一起，所以目前的事情就是寻找她，没必要紧张兮兮的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"She'll be above," she presently said --"in one of the rooms you haven't searched."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“她应该在楼上，”她马上说道，“就在你没有找过的一间屋子里。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I found her where I had found her the evening before, but she met my quick challenge with blank, scared ignorance. She had only supposed that, after the repast, I had carried off both the children; as to which she was quite in her right, for it was the very first time I had allowed the little girl out of my sight without some special provision.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我在前一天晚上看到她的地方找到了她。但她一脸茫然，惊慌失措，对我的仓促的质疑一无所知。她还以为我饭后把两个孩子带走了。她这样想倒是完全有道理，因为这是我第一次在没有特别防备的情况下，让这个小女孩离开我的视线。">查看中文翻译</div>
