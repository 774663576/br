<div class="line_en">Villanelle sits in a window seat in the south wing of the Louvre art gallery in Paris. She is wearing a black cashmere sweater, leather skirt, and low-heeled boots. Winter sunshine pours through the vaulted window, illuminating the white marble statue in front of her. Life-sized, and entitled Psyche Revived by Cupid's Kiss, it was carved by the Italian sculptor Antonio Canova in the final years of the eighteenth century.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="薇拉内拉坐在巴黎卢浮宫左翼的一扇窗边。她穿着黑色的羊毛衫，皮质短裙，和低跟靴子。冬日的阳光穿过拱形的窗户，照亮了她面前的大理石雕塑。雕塑和真人一样大小，名字是“丘比特吻醒了普赛克”，这是一位意大利雕塑家安东尼奥·卡诺瓦在十八世纪末期的作品。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It's a beautiful thing. Psyche, awakening, reaches upwards to her winged lover, her arms framing her face. Cupid, meanwhile, tenderly supports her head and breast. Every gesture speaks of love. But to Villanelle, who has been watching the visitors come and go for an hour now, Canova's creation suggests darker possibilities. Is Cupid luring Psyche into a sense of false security so that he can rape her? Or is it Psyche that's sexually manipulating him, by pretending to be passive and feminine?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这雕塑很美。普赛克清醒过来，向上伸出手去触摸她带着翅膀的爱人，他的手臂支撑着她的脸。与此同时，丘比特支撑着她的脑袋和胸膛。每一个动作都在诉说着爱。但对于已经在这儿看着人来人往一个多小时的薇拉内拉来说，卡诺瓦的作品隐藏着黑暗的可能性。丘比特是不是在引诱普赛克进入一种虚假的安全感，以便能够强奸她？或者是普赛克，通过假装被动和温柔在性方面操纵他？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Unaccountably, passers-by seem to take the sculpture at its romantic face value. A young couple imitate the pose, laughing. Villanelle watches closely, notes how the girl's gaze softens, how the flutter of her eyelashes slows, how her smile turns to a shy parting of the lips. Turning the sequence over in her mind like a phrase in a foreign language, Villanelle files it away for future use. Over the course of her twenty-six-year lifespan she has acquired a vast repertoire of such expressions. Tenderness, sympathy, distress, guilt, shock, sadness… Villanelle has never actually experienced any such emotions, but she can simulate them all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莫名其妙地，路人似乎只能看到这座雕塑的浪漫面目。一对年轻情侣模仿着雕塑的动作，哈哈大笑。薇拉内拉仔细观察着他们，注意到女孩的目光如何柔和下来，她的睫毛如何上下翻飞，她的微笑如何变成嘴唇害羞的分开。薇拉内拉将这些变化像外国短语一样吸收进了大脑，存储起来以便日后使用。在她过去的二十六年人生里，她曾经获取了丰富的类似表达方式。温柔，同情，紧张，愧疚，震惊，悲伤…薇拉内拉从未真正感受过任何一种感情，但她可以全部模仿出来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Villanelle looks up. It's Anne-Laure Mercier. Late as usual, with wide apologetic grin. Villanelle smiles, they air-kiss, and stroll towards the Café Mollien on the gallery's first-floor landing. "I've got a secret to tell you," Anne-Laure confides. "And you mustn't tell a soul."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="薇拉内拉抬起头。那是安妮—劳瑞·麦西尔。她像平常一样迟到，脸上挂着歉意的笑容。薇拉内拉微笑，她们互相噘嘴亲吻，漫步走向美术馆一楼楼梯平台上的莫利恩咖啡馆。“我有个秘密要告诉你，”安妮·劳瑞透露。“你不能告诉任何人。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Anne-Laure is the closest thing that Villanelle has to a friend. They met, rather absurdly, at the hairdresser. Anne-Laure is pretty, extroverted and more than a little lonely, having exchanged life at a busy public relations firm for marriage to a wealthy man sixteen years her senior. Gilles Mercier is a senior functionary at the Treasury. He works inordinately long hours, and his greatest passions are his wine cellar and his small but important collection of nineteenth-century ormolu clocks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="安妮—劳瑞是薇拉内拉关系中最接近朋友的存在。她们在理发店见面，这有点荒谬。安妮—劳瑞是个漂亮的，外向的，有点孤独的女人，她在一家繁忙的公关公司工作，与一个比她大16岁的有钱人结了婚。吉勒斯·麦西尔是财政部的高级官员。他工作时间非常长，他最大的爱好是他的酒窖和他收藏的十九世纪镀金钟表，虽然数量不多，但很重要。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But Anne-Laure wants to have fun, a commodity sadly lacking in the life she shares with Gilles and his clocks.

<div class="line_en">"Just be careful," Villanelle warns her. "You have a lot to lose. And most of your so-called friends would go straight to Gilles if they thought you were playing around."</div>

<div class="line_en">In truth, it suits Villanelle's purposes to spend time with Anne-Laure. She's well-connected, with an insider's access to the finer things of life. Haute couture shows, tables at the best restaurants, membership of the best clubs. Besides which she's undemanding company, and two women together attract far less attention than a woman on her own. On the negative side Anne-Laure is sexually reckless, and it can only be a matter of time before some indiscretion is brought to Gilles's attention. When that happens, Villanelle doesn't want to give the impression that she's complicit in his wife's infidelity. The last thing she needs is the hostile attention of a senior public servant.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是事实，薇拉内拉花时间和安妮—劳瑞待在一起符合她的目的。安妮—劳瑞人脉很广，而且和内部人员呆在一起可以享受到更多特权。高级时装秀，最好餐厅的桌子，最好俱乐部的会员。除此之外，她是一个要求不多的同伴，两个女人在一起也比一个女人独自吸引的注意力要少得多。从消极的方面来看，安妮—劳瑞在性方面总是粗心大意，她的轻率的行为引起吉勒斯的注意只不过是时间问题。如果这事儿发生了，薇拉内拉也不想让他认为她是他妻子不忠的对象。她最不需要的就是来自一位高级公务员的敌意。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As they eat, and Anne-Laure talks about her new amour, Villanelle makes attentive noises. But her mind is elsewhere. Fine-living and designer clothes are all very well, but it's months now since the Palermo operation, and she badly needs to feel her heart race with the prospect of action. More than that, she wants confirmation that she's valued, that the organisation regards her as a prime asset.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他们吃饭时，安妮—劳瑞谈论她的新恋情时，薇拉内拉发出了殷切的回应。但她的脑子在想其他事情。漂亮的生活和设计师的服装都很好，但距离巴勒莫的那次行动已经几个月了，她迫切需要新的行动的来感受她的心跳。除此之外，她还想确认自己的价值，就是组织将她视为重要资产。">查看中文翻译</div>

Outside, beyond the tall windows, the sky has faded to a snow-laden grey, and the Carousel Gardens are almost deserted.</div>

<div class="line_en">There hadn't been many birthday or New Year presents, but her father had taught her to defend herself, and more. There had been memorable days in the forest, wrestling in the snow, shooting at tin cans with his old Makarov service pistol, and lopping through birch-trunks with his Spetsnaz-issue machete. She'd hated the machete at first, finding it heavy and unwieldy, but he'd taught her how it was all in the timing. That if you got it right, the weight of the blade and the arc of the swing did the job for you.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="父亲没给她庆祝多少次生日或送她新年礼物，但她父亲教会她保护自己，以及更多。他们在森林里度过了许多难忘的日子，在雪地里摔跤，用他的旧马卡罗夫军用手枪射击锡罐，用他们特种部队配发的砍刀在桦树树干上砍来砍去。起初她讨厌砍刀，觉得它又重又不方便，但他教会了她如何把握时机。如果你做对了，刀刃的重量和挥刀的弧线就可以帮你完成这项工作。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She'd found out easily enough who killed him. Everyone knew; that was the point. Boris had tried, clumsily, to defraud the Brothers, and they'd shot him and left his body in the street. The following evening Oxana walked into the Pony Club on Ulitsa Pushkina. The three men she was looking for were standing near the bar, drinking and laughing, and when she sauntered up to them, smiling suggestively, they fell silent. In her army-surplus jacket and supermarket jeans she didn't look much like a shlyukha, a whore, but she was certainly acting like one.</div>

<div class="line_en">Her father had been a close-quarter battle instructor before he'd started freelancing for the Brothers' Circle.

<div class="line_en">Oxana stood there for a moment in front of them, looking from face to face with taunting, amused eyes. Then she dropped into a crouch, her arms reaching back between her shoulder blades for the machete in its webbing holster, and drove upwards through her knees as her father had taught her. Half a kilo of titanium-finished steel blurred the air, the chisel-edge passing unchecked through the first man's throat before burying itself deep below the second man's ear. The third man's hand dived to his waistband, but too late: Oxana had already let go of the machete and drawn the Makarov. Around her, she was vaguely aware of panicked breathing, suppressed screams, people backing away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="奥克萨娜在他们面前站了一会儿，用嘲弄和顽皮的眼神看着他们。然后她蹲了下来，双手伸进肩胛骨间，把织带皮套里的弯刀拔出来，然后像她父亲教她的那样，将刀穿过膝盖往上推。半公斤左右的精制钛钢刀在空中划过，凿子那边放肆的插进了一个男人的喉咙，然后深深地埋在第二个男人的耳朵后边。第三个人的手垂到腰带上，但已经太迟了：奥克萨娜已经放开了砍刀，拔出了马卡洛夫手枪。在她周围，她隐约意识到人们的呼吸急促，压抑着尖叫，并且后退。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She shot him through the open mouth. The report was deafening in the enclosed space, and for a moment he just stood there staring at her, blood and brain-matter spilling from a gaping white flap of bone at the back of his head. Then his legs went, and he hit the floor beside the first man, who was somehow still on his knees, a desperate, dregs-of-the-milkshake rasp issuing from the bubbling gash beneath his chin. The third man wasn't finished yet, either. Instead, he was lying in a foetal position in the spreading red lake, his feet working feebly and his fingers plucking at the machete embedded in the angle of his jaw.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她朝着他张开的嘴里开了一枪。枪声在封闭的空间里震耳欲聋，有那么一会儿，他只是站在那里盯着她，血液和脑浆从他脑后张开的白色洞口中喷出。然后他的腿动了，他撞到了第一个男人旁边的地板上，第一个男人不知怎么地仍然跪在地上，奶昔的渣滓流到了他的下巴上。第三个人也还没死透。相反，他像婴儿似的躺在血泊中，脚无力地动着，手指在拔着嵌在下巴里的砍刀。">查看中文翻译</div>

So she knelt beside him, drenching her Kosmo jeans in blood. His gaze was failing, but the eyes still held a question. "I'm his daughter, you cunt," she whispered and, pressing the Makarov's barrel to the nape of his neck, squeezed the trigger. Again, the detonation was appallingly loud, and the man's brains went everywhere, but the sucking noise stopped.</div>

Officially, he was in London as a member of a high-ranking trade delegation; in truth, he and Irema spent most of their time shopping.

<div class="line_en">In a cheerful mood, well lubricated by sake, Horvat was initially unaware that he had been stabbed.

<div class="line_en">Neither could have killed Horvat, for the simple reason that by the time the politician met his end in London both were dead. Golovkina had been found hanged in a hotel wardrobe in Brighton Beach more than a year earlier, and Markovic had predeceased her by four months, blown to shreds by a car bomb in Belgrade. So if Irema Beridze was right, it meant that there was a new female assassin abroad. And this interests Eve very much indeed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不是她们俩杀了霍瓦特，原因很简单，当这个政客面对死亡时，她们都已经死了。一年前，戈洛夫基纳被发现吊死在布莱顿海滩旅馆的衣橱里，而马尔科维奇比她早了四个月，在贝尔格莱德被汽车炸弹炸成了碎片。所以如果艾丽玛·贝里兹说的是真的，这意味着有一个新的女杀手出现了。这引起了伊芙的兴趣。">查看中文翻译</div>

For some years, according to the HST file, the FSB used a woman named Maria Golovkina to execute overseas hits. A member of Russia's small-bore pistol squad at the Athens Olympics, Golovkina is thought to have been trained in covert assassination at the Spetsnaz base in Krasnodar.

<div class="line_en">Since taking over P3 from Bill, Eve has conducted a discreet but exhaustive search of the live case files for any further suggestion of female involvement in an assassination, and has flagged two references. The first involves the shooting in Germany of Aleksandr Simonov, a Russian business oligarch suspected of funding Chechen and Dagestani militants as part of a deal relating to oil and gas concessions. The assassin, who fired a burst of six rounds from an FN P90 sub-machine gun into Simonov's chest outside the Frankfurt headquarters of the AltInvest Bank, was wearing despatch-riders' waterproofs and a full-face motorcycle helmet, and raced away on a machine later identified as a BMW G650Xmoto. Of the dozen or so onlookers questioned afterwards, two stated that they "had the impression" that the shooter was a woman.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="自从从比尔手中接手P3，伊芙对现场案件的档案进行了谨慎而详尽的搜索，以寻找女性参与暗杀的进一步证据，并做了两个标记。第一个是在德国枪击俄罗斯商业寡头亚历山大·西莫诺夫，他被怀疑资助车臣和达吉斯塔尼激进分子，作为石油和天然气特许协议的一部分。刺客使用FN P90冲锋枪，向在阿尔丁维斯特银行法兰克福总部外的西莫诺夫的胸部发射了六发子弹。刺客当时戴着派遣骑手的防水衣和一顶机车头盔，然后骑着一台后来被确认为宝马G650xmoto的摩托上逃走了。在随后询问的十几名旁观者中，有两人说他们“有印象”枪手是个女人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The other case, the close-up slaying in Sicily of a Mafia boss named Salvatore Greco, is apparently non-political. Local innuendo attributes the slaying, directly or indirectly, to the dead man's nephew, Leoluca Messina, who has since assumed the leadership of the Greco clan. But there has also been speculation in the press about an accomplice, the so-called "woman in the red dress." According to the investigators of the DIA, the Direzione Investigativa Antimafia, Greco was found dead in a private box at the Teatro Massimo in Palermo, following an opera performance. He had been shot in the heart at close range with two low-velocity.22 rounds. His two bodyguards were also found dead on the floor of the box, despatched with single shots to the base of the skull.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="另一个案子是，在西西里近距离杀害了一个名叫萨尔瓦多·格雷克的黑手党头目，这显然是非政治性的。当地人含沙射影将这起谋杀事件直接或间接归因于死者的侄子利奥卢卡·梅西纳，他自那以后一直担任格雷克家族的领导。但媒体也有猜测，有一名共犯，即所谓的“穿红裙子的女人”。据反黑手党调查局的调查人员称，在巴勒莫的马西莫剧院，一场歌剧演出后，格雷克被发现死在他的私人里。他被近距离射中心脏，两发低速0.22子弹。他的两名保镖也被发现死在包厢的地板上，被从颅骨底部一枪打死。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Which, Eve reflects, is certainly no accident. The woman is well aware that the CCTV camera is there. But the really strange detail is one that the DIA have not made public. Before Greco was killed, he was immobilised with a lethal tranquilliser apparently delivered via a custom-made device that was found buried in his left eye. A photograph of this device is in the online case-file, along with details of its inner workings. It's a sinister-looking thing: a curved and hollowed steel spike containing an inner reservoir and armed with a tiny plunger.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伊芙认为，这肯定不是个巧合。这个女人清楚的知道那里有监控录像。但调查局并未向外界公布的细节中，有一点相当奇怪。在格雷克死之前，他被一种致命的镇静剂控制住了，那显然是通过一种扎在他左眼里的特制装置运输的。这个装置的照片和其他细节都在附在文件当中。这是一个险恶的东西：一个弯曲的中空钢钉，里面有一个储液罐，上面有一个小的活塞。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Leoluca Messina is known to have been at the theatre that night, and a witness has described seeing him in the bar shortly before curtain-up, talking to a striking dark-haired woman in a red dress.

For a moment, she allows her thoughts to linger on the airy red-brick mansions in Netherhall Gardens, just five minutes' walk away. A first-floor apartment in one of those would be perfect. And about as likely to come into her and Niko's possession as Buckingham Palace. The combined salaries of a Security Services officer and a teacher just didn't stretch to that sort of place.

<div class="line_en">Eve met Niko four years ago, when she first joined the club. At the time she was less interested in improving her bridge-playing than in finding a social life disconnected from the intense, inward-looking hive of Thames House. A social life that would hopefully feature an attractive, intelligent man. In her mind's eye she saw a suave figure, his features not quite discernible, leading her up a broad flight of steps to a smart West End restaurant.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="四年前，伊芙第一次来这家俱乐部时，认识了尼科。那时，比起提高自己的桥牌技巧，她更感兴趣于，寻找一种远离泰晤士大厦里紧张封闭的蜂巢生活的社交方式。一种以有魅力、聪明的男人为特征的社交生活。在她心中，有一个精明练达的样子，样貌却看不清楚，于是她走上了宽阔的台阶，来到了一家漂亮的西区餐馆。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The bridge club, whose members had an average age somewhere north of fifty, did not deliver such a man. Had she wished to meet retired accountants and widowed dentists, it would have been just the place, but attractive single men under forty were thin on the ground. Niko wasn't there when she first presented herself; she and a couple of other prospective members were attended to by Mrs. Shapiro, the blue-haired club secretary.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="桥牌俱乐部的成员平均年龄在50岁以上，但没有她心中那样的人。如果她想见见退休会计师和丧偶的牙医，那儿就很合适，但四十岁以下的漂亮单身男子就很稀少。她第一次自我介绍的时候尼科不在；她和其他几位准会员都由蓝头发的秘书夏皮罗夫人陪同。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dispirited by the experience, she was in two minds about going back the next week. But she went, and this time Niko was there. A tall man with patient brown eyes and the moustache of a nineteenth-century cavalry officer, he took charge of Eve from the moment she arrived, squiring her to a table, summoning two more players, and partnering her without comment for half-a-dozen hands. Then, dismissing the others, he faced her over the green baize table.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这经历使伊芙灰心丧气，她对下个星期是否会去犹豫不决。但她去了，这次尼科在那里。他是个高个子男人，有着耐心的棕色眼睛，留着十九世纪骑兵军官的小胡子，从伊芙来的那一刻起，他就开始照顾她，把她推到桌子旁，又召集了两名队员，未置一词的和她一起打了几把牌。然后，他赶走了其他人，坐在她对面的绿色桌子旁。">查看中文翻译</div>

But she didn't book the London flight; instead she took a taxi hailed at random outside the Galeries Lafayette on the Boulevard Haussmann, and paid cash for her ticket when she got to the airport. Basic counter-surveillance measures, including a last-second pull-off into a service station on the A1 autoroute, told her that she wasn't followed from Paris. And Martín was in the business-class lounge before her, already checked in. Most importantly, her instincts -- highly tuned when it's a question of her own survival -- tell her that this man is not playing a role. That he really is the over-groomed seducer that he appears to be. The joke about narcissistic types like Martín is that they always think they're in control -- at work, in conversation, during sex.</div>

A hunting dog rejected by its previous owner, the animal attached itself devotedly to Oxana's mother, who was already gravely ill.

Walking northwards, navigating on impulse, Villanelle turns from South Audley Street into Hill Street, then through an archway into a narrower road leading to a square so small it's almost a courtyard. One side is taken up by a brightly illuminated gallery window, beyond which a private view is taking place.

Anonymous, faintly sinister groupings, several with the faces blacked out.

<div class="line_en">Again, that umber sky, against which the avenues of leafless beeches and oaks are a darker grey-brown. It's early afternoon but the light is already ebbing. Villanelle walks fast along the slush-banked paths, hands in pockets, head down. There are other walkers, but she barely glances at them. At intervals statues loom out of the dimness, their outlines blurred with encrusted snow. On a balustraded bridge across the Serpentine she pauses for a moment. Beneath a cracked and starred pane of ice the water is a lightless black. A realm of darkness and forgetting to which, on days like this, she feels herself almost hypnotically drawn.</div>

<div class="line_en">Angling sharply southwards, she glances back at the bridge. The man has disappeared, but she still senses his presence. Heading northwards for the nearest exit she performs a cleaning run, designed to shake off any tail that she might have picked up. No one follows, no one changes direction, no one speeds up to match her pace. But if they're serious, whoever they are, they'll have a primary team foot-following, and a secondary team on static surveillance, ready to latch on if she burns the primaries.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她向南急转弯，回头看了一眼那座桥。男人已经不见了，但她仍然能感觉到他的存在。她朝着最近的出口向北跑去，做了一次清理跑步，目的是甩掉她可能带着的尾巴。没有人跟着她，没有人改变方向，没有人加速以配合她的步伐。但是无论他们是谁，如果他们是认真要跟踪她，他们都会有一个主要的跟随者，还有一个监视的次要团队，准备好在她突然动起来时捕捉她的动向。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Forcing herself to breathe steadily, she makes for the Marble Arch underpass network. With its multiple exits, it's a good place to expose and lose a tail. Descending the steps at Cumberland Gate she surfaces beside the Edgware Road, and hovers in a sports shop entrance, watching the reflection of the underpass exit in the plate-glass window. No one glances at her, no one breaks step. Strolling to the Marble Arch entrance, she speed-walks the hundred-odd metres through the underpass, cuts back on herself by Speaker's Corner, and makes for the tube station. On the westbound Central Line platform she lets the first two trains pass, scanning the platform for stay-behinds. The line's busy, and there are several possibles. A young woman in a grey windproof jacket, carrying a backpack. A bearded guy in a reefer jacket. A middle-aged couple holding hands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她强迫自己平稳地呼吸，走向大理石拱门站的地铁网络。它有多个出口，是一个暴露和甩掉尾巴的好地方。她从坎伯兰门的台阶上下来，走到埃奇维尔路旁，在一家运动商店的入口处徘徊，看着玻璃窗里地下通道出口的倒影。没有人看着她，也没有人停下脚步。她漫步到大理石拱门站入口，快速进入地下通道走了一百多米，在演讲角折返，向地铁站走去。在西行的中心线站台上，她没有上前两列地铁，扫视着站台上有没有一样没有上车的人。这趟线很繁忙，她有几个怀疑对象。一个穿着灰色防风夹克，背着背包的年轻女子。一个穿着紧身短外衣的留胡子的男人。一对牵着手的中年夫妇。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Turning eastwards, Villanelle walks along Bayswater Road towards Marble Arch. Not racing, but fast enough to make any tail pick up his or her speed. She stops briefly at a bus stop as if resting her legs, discreetly checking the area for anyone in the calculatedly drab plumage of the professional pavement artist. There's no one obvious, but then if she had one of MI5's A4 teams locked on to her, there wouldn't be.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="薇拉内拉向东转，沿着贝斯瓦特路走向大理石拱门。她没有跑，但速度足够快，任何跟着的尾巴都会跟着加速。她在一个公共汽车站停了一会儿，好像在歇脚，她小心翼翼地检查这个区域是否有故意打扮成单调的专业马路画家的人。看起来没有哪个人是，但如果有军情五处的A4小组中的一个锁定着她的话，她没看出来就很正常了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And perhaps, she tells herself later in the South Audley Street apartment, no one was following me anyway. What would be the point? If the UK Intelligence Services know who and what I am, then it's all over. There won't be an arrest, just a visit from a Special Forces action team, probably E Squadron, and cremation in a municipal waste incinerator.

<div class="line_en">Stepping onto the third train, she travels as far as Queensway, and then just as the doors are closing, squeezes out between them. Crossing the platform, she returns eastbound to Bond Street, surfaces, and hails a taxi in Davies Street. For the next ten minutes she sends the driver on a circuitous route through Mayfair. A grey BMW follows them for a time, but then turns eastwards on Curzon Street with an irritable growl. A minute later a black Ford Ka appears in the wing-mirror, and three turn-offs later is still there. As they coast into Clarges Mews, a choke-point, Villanelle hands the driver a fifty-pound note and issues swift instructions. Thirty seconds later the taxi drifts to a halt, blocking the road, and the engine dies. As Villanelle slips out of a rear door, she hears the angry blare of the Ka's horn, but no one follows her down the narrow, brick-walled passageway, and when she doubles back five minutes later, the mews is deserted.</div>

Most are men, but there are a few couples here and there, and several younger women in T-shirts printed with Kedrin's portrait.

He is quickly surrounded by admirers, who take it in turn to address a few words to him and shake his hand. The woman from the front row waits on the outskirts of the group, a faint smile touching her sharp, cat-like features. If I dressed like that I'd look like a librarian, Eve muses. So how come this little fascist princess gets to look like Audrey Hepburn?</div>

<div class="line_en">Back in her room she switches on an iPod-sized UHF receiver, and inserts one of the in-ear headphones. Nothing, as she expected, just a faint, ambient hiss. Pocketing the receiver, leaving one ear-bud trailing, she takes a waterproof case from the valise. Inside, each component lying in its bed of customised foam, is the weapon she ordered from Konstantin: a polymer-bodied CZ 75 9mm handgun and an Isis-2 suppressor. Villanelle prefers a lightweight action on a combat weapon, and the CZ's trigger-pull weight has been adjusted to two kilos for double-action firing, and one kilo for single action.</div>

<div class="line_en">Letting herself into Room 416, Villanelle opens the valise, takes out a packet of surgical gloves, and exchanges a pair for the leather ones she's wearing. Then, from a sealed polythene bag, she takes a micro-transmitter the size of a fingernail, and a pinch of Blu-Tack. Placing this in the pocket of her parka, she leaves the room and takes the stairs up to the fifth floor, where she seems to straighten a picture on the wall outside Room 521. This done, she continues upwards to the sixth floor, where the stairs terminate in an exit to the roof. It's unlocked, and stepping outside she conducts a quick reconnaissance of the area, noting the placement of chimney stacks and fire-escape ladders.

<div class="line_en">So after attaching the suppressor, Villanelle loads the Czech handgun with Russian-made Chernaya Roza -- Black Rose -- hollowpoint rounds. These are constructed with an oxidised copper jacket whose six sections, on impact, peel back like petals. This slows penetration, initiates a massive and incapacitating shockwave, and causes enhanced disruption of tissue along the wound path. For a 9mm round, the Black Rose's stopping power is unequalled.</div>

Why go to the trouble of flying that girl halfway round the world when she's already played her part?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我猜是彼得，或者他的一个手下，在假试镜时拿走了她的头发，也许是从她的发梳里拿出来的。然后我们的枪手，在露西入住酒店后把它们放在包里。还有一个问题。为什么是洛杉矶？既然她已经扮演了自己的角色，为什么还要费劲把她带到半个地球之外呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That's easy," says Eve. "To make sure she's out of the picture by the time the news of the murder breaks. They can't risk her reading about it online, or hearing about it on the radio, and going straight to the police with what she knows. So they make sure that she's taking off for LA -- an eleven-hour flight -- at the precise time that the murder's discovered on Saturday morning. Which not only renders Lucy incommunicado, but also sets a perfect false trail, giving the real killer and her team plenty of time to cover their tracks and vanish."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那很简单，”伊芙说。“是为了确保在谋杀消息传出之前，她什么都不知情。他们不能冒险让她在网上看到，或者在收音机里听到，然后直接把她所知道的告诉警察。所以他们要确保她正飞往洛杉矶——一趟11个小时的航班——正是谋杀将被发现的准确时间，周六早上。这不仅使露西无法和警方交流，而且还设置了一个完美的假踪迹，给真正的杀手和她的团队足够的时间来掩盖他们的踪迹并消失。”">查看中文翻译</div>
