<div class="line_en">In the evening a strange thing happened: the twenty families became one family, the children were the children of all. The loss of home became one loss, and the golden time in the West was one dream. And it might be that a sick child threw despair into the hearts of twenty families, of a hundred people; that a birth there in a tent kept a hundred people quiet and awestruck through the night and filled a hundred people with the birth-joy in the morning. A family which the night before had been lost and fearful might search its goods to find a present for a new baby. In the evening, sitting about the fires, the twenty were one. They grew to be units of the camps, units of the evenings and the nights. A guitar unwrapped from a blanket and tuned -- and the songs, which were all of the people, were sung in the nights. Men sang the words, and women hummed the tunes.</div>

<div class="line_en">The cars of the migrant people crawled out of the side roads onto the great cross-country highway, and they took the migrant way to the West. In the daylight they scuttled like bugs to the westward; and as the dark caught them, they clustered like bugs near to shelter and to water. And because they were lonely and perplexed, because they had all come from a place of sadness and worry and defeat, and because they were all going to a new mysterious place, they huddled together; they talked together; they shared their lives, their food, and the things they hoped for in the new country. Thus it might be that one family camped near a spring, and another camped for the spring and for company, and a third because two families had pioneered the place and found it good. And when the sun went down, perhaps twenty families and twenty cars were there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="流民的汽车从各条路线颠颠簸簸地开到了这条横贯全国的大公路上，沿着这条流亡的路到西部去。白天那些汽车像硬壳虫似的赶紧向西爬去，天黑了，它们又像硬壳虫似的聚集在可以避避风雨和有水的地方。由于他们又孤寂，又迷惘，由于他们都是从苦恼、忧愁和倒楣的地方来的，而且都要到一个神秘的新地方去，他们便聚在一起，一起谈话；一起过着同样的生活，分享着食物，他们对于新的去处抱着共同的希望。因此只要有一家人在有水的地方支了帐篷，另一家也就为了用水，为了搭伴而在那里支起帐篷来，第三家也因为已经有两家开辟了那个地方，便觉得那是很合适的地方。一到太阳西下的时候，那地方也许就有二十来户人家和二十来辆汽车了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the worlds, social conduct became fixed and rigid, so that a man must say "Good morning" when asked for it, so that a man might have a willing girl if he stayed with her, if he fathered her children and protected them. But a man might not have one girl one night and another the next, for this would endanger the worlds.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在那些世界里，社交的道德标准是严格的，因此人们相见必须说一声“你好”；一个男人如果跟一个本心情愿的女人住在一起，如果他像做父亲一般爱护她的孩子，那他就可以把她当做妻子。但是一个男人却不能今天夜里跟一个女人同居，明天夜里又跟另一个同居，因为这样就会危害这些世界了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And the families learned, although no one told them, what rights are monstrous and must be destroyed: the right to intrude upon privacy, the right to be noisy while the camp slept, the right of seduction or rape, the right of adultery and theft and murder. These rights were crushed, because the little worlds could not exist for even a night with such rights alive.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些人家懂得了——虽然谁也没有告诉他们——哪些权利是有害的，必须加以摧毁；比如侵犯私生活的权利，当别人在帐篷里安睡的时候去吵吵闹闹的权利，诱奸或是强奸的权利，私通、偷盗和谋杀的权利等等。这些权利被消灭了，因为如果有这样的权利存在，这些小小的世界便一夜也不能安生。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And with the laws, the punishments -- and there were only two -- a quick and murderous fight or ostracism; and ostracism was the worst. For if one broke the laws his name and face went with him, and he had no place in any world, no matter where created.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而且随着法律的出现也就有了惩罚——只有两种——那就是迅速地凶斗一场或是放逐；放逐是最重的惩罚。因为如果有谁破坏了法律，他的名誉和体面就都扫地了，那他就在任何地方建成的世界里都没有立脚之地了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And as the worlds moved westward, rules became laws, although no one told the families. It is unlawful to foul near the camp; it is unlawful in any way to foul the drinking water; it is unlawful to eat good rich food near one who is hungry, unless he is asked to share.</div>

<div class="line_en">A certain physical pattern is needed for the building of a world -- water, a river bank, a stream, a spring, or even a faucet unguarded. And there is needed enough flat land to pitch the tents, a little brush or wood to build the fires. If there is a garbage dump not too far off, all the better; for there can be found equipment -- stove tops, a curved fender to shelter the fire, and cans to cook in and to eat from.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="建成一个世界，需要适当的地势——水呀，河岸呀，泉水呀，甚至还要一个公用的水龙头。此外还要有宽敞的地面来支帐篷；要有一些柴来生火。如果有一个垃圾堆离得不太远，那就更好了；因为那里可以找到日用的什物——如火炉的烟囱，用来给火挡风的弯曲的挡泥板，以及用来煮东西和盛东西的罐头盒等等。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There grew up government in the worlds, with leaders, with elders. A man who was wise found that his wisdom was needed in every camp; a man who was a fool could not change his folly with his world. And a kind of insurance developed in these nights. A man with food fed a hungry man, and thus insured himself against hunger. And when a baby died a pile of silver coins grew at the door flap, for a baby must be well buried, since it has had nothing else of life. An old man may be left in a potter's field, but not a baby.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="统治的机构在那些世界里形成起来，有领袖，也有元老。有智慧的人发觉他自己的智慧在各个帐篷里都是大家所需要的；愚蠢的人也不能随着他所在的世界改变他的愚蠢行为。一种保险制度也在这些夜世界里形成了。有食物的人养活挨饿的人，这么一来，也就保证了自己不至于挨饿。每逢有婴孩死了，帐篷的门口就会攒起一小堆银币，因为婴孩对人生不曾有过别的享受，死了最可怜，必须好好埋葬。老年人死了，不妨把尸首留在公共墓地里，但是婴孩死了，却不能这样处理。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the morning the tents came down, the canvas was folded, the tent poles tied along the running board, the beds put in place on the cars, the pots in their places. And as the families moved westward, the technique of building up a home in the evening and tearing it down with the morning light became fixed; so that the folded tent was packed in one place, the cooking pots counted in their box. And as the cars moved westward, each member of the family grew into his proper place, grew into his duties; so that each member, old and young, had his place in the car; so that in the weary, hot evenings, when the cars pulled into the camping places, each member had his duty and went to it without instruction: children to gather wood, to carry water; men to pitch the tents and bring down the beds; women to cook the supper and to watch while the family fed. And this was done without command. The families, which had been units of which the boundaries were a house at night, a farm by day, changed their boundaries. In the long hot light, they were silent in the cars moving slowly westward; but at night they integrated with any group they found.</div>

<div class="line_en">Thus they changed their social life -- changed as in the whole universe only man can change. They were not farm men any more, but migrant men. And the thought, the planning, the long staring silence that had gone out to the fields, went now to the roads, to the distance, to the West. That man whose mind had been bound with acres lived with narrow concrete miles. And his thought and his worry were not any more with rainfall, with wind and dust, with the thrust of the crops. Eyes watched the tires, ears listened to the clattering motors, and minds struggled with oil, with gasoline, with the thinning rubber between air and road. Then a broken gear was tragedy. Then water in the evening was the yearning, and food over the fire. Then health to go on was the need and strength to go on, and spirit to go on. The wills thrust westward ahead of them, and fears that had once apprehended drought or flood now lingered with anything that might stop the westward crawling.</div>

<div class="line_en">And perhaps a man brought out his guitar to the front of his tent. And he sat on a box to play, and everyone in the camp moved slowly in toward him, drawn in toward him. Many men can chord a guitar, but perhaps this man was a picker. There you have something -- the deep chords beating, beating, while the melody runs on the strings like little footsteps. Heavy hard fingers marching on the frets. The man played and the people moved slowly in on him until the circle was closed and tight, and then he sang "Ten-Cent Cotton and Forty-Cent Meat." And the circle sang softly with him. And he sang "Why Do You Cut Your Hair, Girls?" And the circle sang. He wailed the song, "I'm Leaving Old Texas," that eerie song that was sung before the Spaniards came, only the words were Indian then.</div>
