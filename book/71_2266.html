Usually so crabby and ill-tempered, she had become a model of consideration and good manners. If the jeweller had known her earlier he would surely have been astonished by the change, which could not help arousing his suspicions. As for Caderousse, he said nothing but went on walking up and down and seemed unwilling even to look at his guest. When supper was over, Caderousse himself went to the door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“珠宝商开始吃饭，卡康脱女人则继续向他献小殷勤，象一个小心的主妇一样。她平常那样古怪别扭，这时却变成了一位会照拂人的有礼貌的模范主妇了。要是那珠宝商以前曾和她相处过，他对于这样明显的一个转变就会表示惊奇，因而一定会使他产生某种怀疑。这时，卡德罗斯继续在房间里踱来踱去，似乎不愿去望他的客人，但当那个外乡人一吃完饭，他就走到门口，把门打开。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“‘暴风雨似乎过去了。’他说。但似乎特地要驳斥他的言论似的，正当那时，打下了一个很响的霹雳，几乎把房子连根拔起，同时突然地刮进来一阵夹雨的狂风，扑灭了他手里的那盏灯。卡德罗斯关上门，回到他的客人那儿，而卡康脱女人则到壁炉里冒烟的余烬上点起一支蜡烛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"'Here,' she said to the jeweller. 'You must be tired. I have put clean linen on the bed. Go on up, and sleep well.'</div>

<div class="line_en">"All these details, which I have recalled since the events, did not strike me while they were taking place before my eyes. When it comes down to it, everything that had happened was quite normal and, apart from the story of the diamond, which struck me as somewhat improbable, everything was perfectly consistent. As I was dropping with tiredness and intended myself to take advantage of the first break in the weather, I decided to sleep for a few hours, then make off while it was still dark.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这种种情形，虽然自那时以来就一直深深地印在我的脑子里，但当我亲眼目睹这一切的时候，却对我并没有多大的印象，的确，这一切（除了那个钻石的故事当然有点令人难以相信以外）似乎都是很自然的。那时我虽然疲倦，心里却很想等暴风雨一平息就继续上路，所以我决定利用这比较安静的时间来睡几个钟头，以恢复我的精力。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Joannès waited for a moment longer to see whether the storm would abate, and when he was sure that the thunder and rain were only increasing in strength he said goodnight to his hosts and went up the stairs.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I felt my eyes closing despite myself and, as I had no suspicion of what was to come, I did not try to fight against sleep. I took one last look around the kitchen. Caderousse was sitting, beside a long table, on one of those wooden benches which they use instead of chairs in village inns. His back was turned to me, so that his face was hidden -- though, even if he had been sitting on the opposite side of the table, it would still have been impossible for me to see his face, because his head was buried in his hands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我的眼皮不知不觉地沉重起来，浓厚的睡意爬上了我的身，我当时并不怀疑会出什么事情，所以也就不想去摆脱它的侵袭。当我最后一次向房间里张望的时候，卡德罗斯和他的妻子已经坐下来了，前者坐在一张木头小矮凳上，那种小矮凳在乡下常常是当作椅子用的。他的背向着我，我无法看到他脸上的表情，即使他换了一个方向坐，我也是看不到的，因为他的头已埋在两手之中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"In the room above my head I could hear the jeweller going about his preparations for spending as comfortable a night as he could. Shortly afterwards, the bed creaked under him: he had just got into it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那珠宝商就在我的头顶上，他的一举一动我都可以正确地辨别出来，他先尽力布置了一番，预备舒舒服服地过一夜，然后就向床上一倒，我可以听到床在他的重压之下咯吱咯吱地呻吟。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"At that moment the dying embers of the fire caught a piece of dry wood that until then had remained unconsumed, and a brighter light flared up, illuminating the dark interior of the inn. La Carconte was staring at her husband and, since he remained in the same position, I saw her reach out towards him with her gnarled hand and touch his forehead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“正当这时，那垂熄的余烬引着了旁边的一片木头，壁炉里重新吐出一个火头，于是一片火光照亮了这个场面和场面上的演员。卡康脱女人依旧把她的眼光盯在她丈夫身上，但因为他毫无改变姿势的意思，她就伸出她那只瘦骨嶙嶙的硬手，在他的前额上点了一下。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Caderousse started. I thought I could see the woman's lips move, but either she was speaking in a very low voice or else I was already dulled by sleep, because the sound of her words did not reach me. In fact, I saw everything through a kind of mist, in that period of uncertainty that precedes sleep, when we feel that we are starting to dream. At length my eyes closed and I was no longer aware of my surroundings.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“卡德罗斯打了一个寒颤。那女人的嘴巴似乎在动，好象是在讲话，但不知是因为她讲话的声音很低呢，还是因为我的感官已被睡意弄钝了，她讲的话我一个字都没听到。甚至我所看到的东西也都象隔了一重雾似的，自己也辨不出究竟是醒着还是在做梦。最后，我的眼睛闭上了，我就失去了知觉。究竟我在这种无知无觉的状态中停留了多久，自己也不知道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I was slumbering profoundly when I was awoken by a pistol-shot, followed by a dreadful cry. Someone staggered a few steps across the floor of the bedroom and an inert mass crashed on the stairs, directly above my head.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I was still not entirely master of my senses. I heard groans, then stifled cries, like those that might accompany a struggle. A final shout, lasting longer than the rest and ending in a series of moans, forced me entirely from my lethargy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我的神志还没有完全清醒，就又听到呻吟和半窒息的喊叫声混成一片，象是有人在作一场拚死的挣扎。最后的那一声喊叫比以前拖得更长，后来愈来愈弱，渐渐地变成了呻吟，这一声喊叫有效地把我从迷离恍惚的昏睡状态中唤醒。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I sat up on one elbow, opened my eyes, which could see nothing in the darkness, and put my hand to my forehead, where I thought I felt a heavy shower of warm rain dripping through the boards of the stairway.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“然后，他又从碗柜里拿出钞票和金洋，一包塞进他的裤子口袋里，一包塞进他的背心口袋里，匆匆地拿了两三件内衣打成一个小包袱，冲到门口，消失在夜的黑暗里了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"After a short while he came back. He was holding the box in his hand and making sure that the diamond was inside. Then he paused for a moment, trying to decide which of his pockets to put it in. Finally, having no doubt concluded that his pocket was not a secure enough hiding-place, he wrapped it in the red kerchief around his neck.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不久，他手里拿着一只鲛皮的小盒子下来了，他打开那只盒子，看清楚钻石的确仍旧在里面，似乎犹豫不决，不知把它藏在哪一只口袋里好，然后，象是觉得哪一只口袋都不够安全似的，就把它夹在他的红手帕里，把手帕小心地盘在他的头上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The horrid sounds had given way to the most profound silence. Then I heard a man's footsteps above my head and the creak of the stairs. He came into the downstairs room, went across to the fireplace and lit a candle. It was Caderousse. His face was livid and his nightshirt covered in blood. Once he had lit the candle, he hurried back upstairs and I heard him moving about there again, with rapid and uneasy steps.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“在那一阵可怕的闹声之后，是一片最深沉的，打不破的沉寂，只有一个男人在我的头顶上走动。楼梯在他的脚步下咯吱咯吱地叫起来。那个人走到楼下的房间里，走近壁炉前面，点起一支蜡烛。那是卡德罗斯，他的脸色苍白，衬衫被鲜血染成了红色。点亮了灯以后，他急急忙忙地又上楼去，于是我头顶上的房间里又发出他那急促不安的脚步声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It was only now that everything became clear to me. I felt responsible for what had happened, as though I were really the guilty party. I thought I could hear someone moaning. Perhaps the unfortunate jeweller was not dead and it was within my power to go to his aid and make up for some of the evil that I had, if not done, at least allowed to be done… I thrust my shoulder against one of the ill-fitting planks which separated the sort of cubby-hole, in which I was hiding, from the downstairs room. The planks gave way and I was inside the house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那时我一切都明白了。我拿刚才发生的这件事责备我自己，好象这件罪案是我自己干的似的。我好象觉得还听到微弱的呻吟声，满心以为那不幸的珠宝商还没咽气，我就决定去救他，可借此略微赎罪，不是赎我自己所犯的那个罪，而是赎我刚才没去阻止的那个罪。怀着这个想法，我使出全身的力气从我所蜷伏的地方撞进隔壁房间里去，我和里面的房间原只隔着一重参差不齐的木板，我用力一撞，木板就倒了下去，我发觉自己已进到屋子里面。">查看中文翻译</div>

I was reluctant to embark on the story of the diamond but, against all my expectations, it proved to be true, point by point, and -- also to my surprise -- he gave complete credence to everything that I told him. Whereupon, encouraged by his sweet and forgiving nature, recognizing that he entirely understood the customs of my country and feeling that from such charitable lips I might perhaps receive absolution for the only crime I had ever committed, I told him, under the seal of the confessional, all about what had happened in Auteuil. What I did on impulse had the same effect as if I had contrived it: by confessing this first murder, even though nothing compelled me to do so, I proved to him that I had not committed the second.

There are two medicines for all ills: time and silence. Now, Monsieur Bertuccio, let me walk awhile in this garden. The feelings that are so powerful for you, who took part in the drama, will be for me almost a sweet sensation and one that will add to the value of my property. You understand, Monsieur Bertuccio: trees only give us pleasure because they give shade, and shade itself only pleases us because it is full of reveries and visions. I bought a garden, imagining that I was purchasing a simple space enclosed in walls; but it was not so at all: suddenly the space has become a garden full of ghosts, which were nowhere mentioned in the deed of sale. I like ghosts. I have heard it said that the dead have never done, in six thousand years, as much evil as the living do in a single day. So go back inside, Monsieur Bertuccio, and sleep in peace. If the confessor who gives you the last rites is less compassionate towards you than Abbé Busoni, fetch me, if I am still of this world, and I shall find the words that will gently soothe your soul as it prepares to start out on that rough voyage that they call eternity."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伯都西奥说这几句话的时候用两手遮住了他的脸，而基督山则用一种无法描写的目光凝视着他。伯爵暂时沉默了一会儿，这短暂的沉默使周围的气氛更加庄严，尤其是在这样的时间，这样的地点。然后，他用一种完全不象他平时的态度的抑郁口吻说：“我们今天的游览就此为止吧，而为了正式结束这一篇谈话，我可以把布沙尼长老亲口对我说的几句话复述给你听：‘一切罪恶只有两种救药——时间和沉默。’伯都西奥先生，现在且让我独自在这个花园里散一会儿步。你在那幕可怕的场面里是一个演员，旧地重游会唤醒你痛苦的回忆，但我却几乎可以说很高兴，觉得这处产业的价值已经增加了。你知道，伯都西奥先生，树木所以能使人觉得可爱就是因为它们能造成树荫，而树荫之所以使人觉得可爱，只是因为它充满了幻想。我在这儿买了一座花园，原以为只是买了一块四壁环绕的地方而已，但那个地方突然却变成了一个鬼影憧憧的花园，而那又是在契约上不曾提到过的。我现在就喜欢鬼，而我从来没听说过死人在六千年之间所造成的伤害而活人在一天之间就造成了。去休息吧，伯都西奥，安心去睡觉好了。在你临终的时候，假如你的忏悔师没有布沙尼长老那样的宽容，要是我还活着，你可以派人来找我，我可以找到话来安慰你的灵魂，使你安心地踏上那‘永恒’的崎岖的旅程。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Bertuccio bowed respectfully to the count and went off, sighing. Monte Cristo remained alone and, taking four steps forward, said: "Here, beside this plane-tree, is the grave where the child was placed. Over there, the little gate by which one might enter the garden. In that corner, the back stairway that led to the bedroom. I don't think I need to take all that down in my notebook. Here before my eyes, around me, beneath my feet, in relief, is the living map of it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伯都西奥恭恭敬敬地鞠了一躬，转身叹着气走了。当他已经走出视线的时候，基督山站起身来，向前走了三四步，轻轻地说：“这儿，就在这棵梧桐底下，是那婴儿的坟墓。那面是通花园的小门。这个角上是通寝室的暗梯。这些情节我不必在本子上记录下来，因为就在我的眼前，就在我的脚下，就在我的周围，已有种种活生生的事实给我勾成了一个轮廓。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That same evening, on arriving at the house on the Champs-Elysées, the Count of Monte Cristo inspected the whole residence as a man might have done who had been familiar with it for many years. Not once, even though he went ahead, did he open one door in mistake for another, or go up a staircase or down a corridor which did not lead directly to where he wanted it to take him. Ali accompanied him in this night-time inspection. The count gave Bertuccio several orders for the embellishment or rearrangement of the apartments and, taking out his watch, told his assiduous Nubian: "It is half-past eleven. Haydée will soon be here. Have the Frenchwomen been told?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当天晚上，到达香榭丽榭大道的寓所以后，基督山伯爵到全屋各处去巡视了一遍，看起来象是对于每一个转弯抹角都已早就摸熟了似的。虽然他领头在前面走，他却不曾摸错一扇门，走错一条走廊或楼梯，总能一点不错地走到他所想看的地方或房间。阿里陪他作这次夜间视察。伯爵先向伯都西奥吩咐了一番，告诉他屋子里应如何改进和变换，然后摸出表来看了一看，对那一旁恭候着的黑奴说：“现在已经十一点半，海蒂就快到了。你有没有去通知过那些法国佣人？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After a last walk round the garden, the count went to look for his carriage. Bertuccio, seeing that he was preoccupied with his thoughts, got up on the seat beside the coachman without saying anything, and the carriage set off for Paris.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伯爵又在花园里转了一遍，然后，重新踏入他的马车，伯都西奥看到他主人的脸上带着深思的表情，就一言不发地去坐在车夫旁边。马车迅速地向巴黎奔去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Very well," Monte Cristo said, used to this sign-language. "There are three of them in the bedroom, then?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Ali pointed towards the suite intended for the beautiful Greek, which was so separate from the rest that, when the door was concealed behind a tapestry, one could visit the whole house without realizing that anyone was living here in a drawing-room and two bedrooms. Ali, as we said, pointed to the suite, indicated the number three with the fingers of his left hand and, opening the same hand out flat, put his head on it and closed his eyes as if asleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿里用手指一指留给希腊美人用的那几个房间，那些房间可说是和全屋的其他房间隔离的，当房门被帷幕遮住的时候，人可以走遍全屋而不会发觉那个地方还有一间客厅和两个房间。阿里在指过房间以后，又伸出左手的三个手指，然后，把手垫在他的头下，闭上眼睛，装出睡觉的样子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes," Ali indicated, nodding his head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="是的——阿里连连点头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ali bowed. Shortly afterwards there was the sound of someone calling to the concierge. The outer gate opened, a carriage drove along the path and stopped beneath the steps. The count came down to find the carriage door already open. He offered his hand to a young woman wrapped in a green silk mantle embroidered in gold and covering her head. She took his hand, kissed it with a degree of love mingled with respect. A few words were exchanged, tenderly on the part of the young woman and with gentle gravity on that of the count, in that sonorous language which antique Homer put into the mouths of his gods.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿里鞠了一躬。正当这时，他们听到了喊门房的声音。大门开了，一辆马车辘辘地滚进车道，在门廊的台阶前面停了下来。伯爵下了台阶，走到那已经打开的车门前面。他把他的手伸给一个青年女人。那个青年女人全身都裹在一件绿色绣金的披风里，她把伯爵的手举到她的唇边，敬爱地吻了一吻。他们用荷马写神话诗的那种音调铿锵的语言交谈了几句话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Madame will be tired this evening," Monte Cristo continued. "She will no doubt want to sleep. She should not be obliged to talk. The French servants must simply greet their new mistress and then retire. Make sure that the Greek servant does not communicate with the French ones."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“夫人今天晚上一定疲倦了，”基督山又说，“她一到立刻就会想休息。叫那些法国佣人不要东问西问地去打扰她，叫她们致敬以后就退出。你也防着一点儿，别让那些希腊佣人和这个国家的佣人勾结。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then, following Ali, who was carrying a torch of pink wax, the young woman, who was none other than the beautiful Greek who habitually accompanied Monte Cristo when he was in Italy, was shown into her apartments and the count retired to the wing that he had reserved for himself. At half-past midnight, all the lights in the house went out, and you might have thought that all its inhabitants were asleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那女人说话的时候表情非常亲切，而伯爵答话的时候则神气温和庄重。那个女的不是别人，就是基督山在意大利的伴侣，那可爱的希腊女人。阿里手里拿着一支玫瑰色的蜡烛在前领路，引她到她的房间里，而伯爵也到他自己的房间里去休息。一小时以后，屋子里的每一盏灯都熄灭了，大概屋子里的人都已经入睡了。">查看中文翻译</div>
