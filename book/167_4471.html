<div class="line_en">The girl never wept. Young as she was, Myrcella Baratheon was a princess born. And a Lannister, despite her name, Tyrion reminded himself, as much Jaime's blood as Cersei's.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这女孩从来不哭。弥赛菈·拜拉席恩虽然小小年纪，但天生就是个公主。她是兰尼斯特家的人，尽管她没这个姓，提利昂提醒自己，她流着兰尼斯特的血液。瑟曦和詹姆的血液。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">To be sure, her smile was a shade tremulous when her brothers took their leave of her on the deck of the Seaswift, but the girl knew the proper words to say, and she said them with courage and dignity. When the time came to part, it was Prince Tommen who cried, and Myrcella who gave him comfort.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tyrion looked down upon the farewells from the high deck of King Robert's Hammer, a great war galley of four hundred oars. Rob's Hammer, as her oarsmen called her, would form the main strength of Myrcella's escort. Lionstar, Bold Wind, and Lady Lyanna would sail with her as well.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="提利昂站在“劳勃国王之锤”号高耸的甲板上，俯视着告别仪式。劳勃国王之锤号是一艘四百桨的巨型战舰，桨手们将她简称为“劳勃之锤”，她是为弥赛菈此行护航的主力。此外，狮星号、烈风号和莱安娜小姐号，也将同行。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It made Tyrion more than a little uneasy to detach so great a part of their already inadequate fleet, depleted as it was by the loss of all those ships that had sailed with Lord Stannis to Dragonstone and never returned, but Cersei would hear of nothing less. Perhaps she was wise. If the girl was captured before she reached Sunspear, the Dornish alliance would fall to pieces. So far Doran Martell had done no more than call his banners. Once Myrcella was safe in Braavos, he had pledged to move his strength to the high passes, where the threat might make some of the Marcher lords rethink their loyalties and give Stannis pause about marching north. It was purely a feint, however. The Martells would not commit to actual battle unless Dorne itself was attacked, and Stannis was not so great a fool. Though some of his bannermen may be, Tyrion reflected. I should think on that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="夕日的王家舰队中有好些船当年随史坦尼斯公爵攻打龙石岛，再也没有回来，由是海军一直元气不足，而今又要分出一部分，提利昂深感不安，但瑟曦决不允许减少护卫。或许她比我明智。若是公主在抵达阳戟城前被俘，与多恩的联盟就会顷刻间土崩瓦解。到目前为止，道朗·马泰尔只是召集诸侯。一旦弥赛菈平安抵达布拉佛斯，他允诺将军队向隘口移动，由此威胁边疆地的领主，动摇他们的忠诚，并减缓史坦尼斯北进的速度。其实这只是虚张声势。除非多恩本土遭到攻击，否则马泰尔家决不会真正参战，而史坦尼斯当然不会蠢到那种地步。不过或许能刺激他旗下的诸侯做出蠢事，提利昂心想，我该把这种可能列入考量。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I do, my lord. We are to follow the coast, staying always in sight of land, until we reach Crackclaw Point. From there we are to strike out across the narrow sea for Braavos. On no account are we to sail within sight of Dragonstone."</div>

<div class="line_en">Tyrion nodded. If the worst happened, the little Seaswift ought to be able to outrun pursuit. A small ship with big sails, she was faster than any warship afloat, or so her captain had claimed. Once Myrcella reached Braavos, she ought to be safe. He was sending Ser Arys Oakheart as her sworn shield, and had engaged the Braavosi to bring her the rest of the way to Sunspear. Even Lord Stannis would hesitate to wake the anger of the greatest and most powerful of the Free Cities. Traveling from King's Landing to Dorne by way of Braavos was scarcely the most direct of routes, but it was the safest… or so he hoped.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="提利昂点点头。就算情况不妙，小巧的海捷号也当能摆脱追逐。她帆大船小，比当前任何一艘战舰都快——至少她的船长如此声称。只要弥赛菈抵达布拉佛斯，想必能确保安全。他派亚历斯·奥克赫特爵士做她的贴身护卫，又请布拉佛斯人护送她前去阳戟城。布拉佛斯是自由贸易城邦里最强大最有势力的一个，史坦尼斯也不能不买它的账。从君临到多恩，经由布拉佛斯虽不是最短路径，却是最安全的…至少他如此期望。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tyrion watched his niece kneel before the High Septon to receive his blessing on her voyage. Sunlight caught in his crystal crown and spilled rainbows across Myrcella's upturned face. The noise from the riverside made it impossible to hear the prayers. He hoped the gods had sharper ears. The High Septon was as fat as a house, and more pompous and long of wind than even Pycelle. Enough, old man, make an end to it, Tyrion thought irritably. The gods have better things to do than listen to you, and so do I.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="提利昂看着外甥女跪在总主教面前，接受祝福，保佑旅途平安。阳光透过水晶冠冕，散射出七彩虹光，照在弥赛菈仰起的脸上。岸边的喧闹使他听不清祷词，只得希望诸神的耳朵比他灵敏。总主教胖得像座房子，比派席尔还会装腔作势，滔滔不绝。够了，老家伙，结束吧，提利昂恼火地想。诸神听够了你的唠叨，还有重要事做，我也是。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">If Lord Stannis knew of this sailing, he could not choose a better time to send his fleet against us. Tyrion glanced back to where the Rush emptied out into Blackwater Bay and was relieved to see no signs of sails on the wide green horizon. At last report, the Baratheon fleet still lay off Storm's End, where Ser Cortnay Penrose continued to defy the besiegers in dead Renly's name. Meanwhile, Tyrion's winch towers stood threequarters complete. Even now men were hoisting heavy blocks of stone into place, no doubt cursing him for making them work through the festivities. Let them curse. Another fortnight, Stannis, that's all I require. Another fortnight and it will be done.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="若史坦尼斯得到这次护航的情报，不趁此机会来攻打君临，更待何时。他不禁回望黑水河注入海湾的河口，天边一条绿线，丝毫不见帆影，他方才感到安心。最新情报显示，由于科塔奈·庞洛斯爵士继续以故去的蓝礼之名坚守城池，拜拉席恩舰队依然在围困风息堡。与此同时，提利昂的绞盘塔业已完成了四分之三。此时此刻，人们正将一块块沉重的石头吊上去，放置就位，无疑正边做边骂，诅咒他让他们在节庆时间工作。随他们骂。再有两个星期，史坦尼斯，我只要你再给我两个星期。半个月后就一切就绪。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Bronn escorted him through the crowd to join his sister and her sons. Cersei ignored him, preferring to lavish her smiles on their cousin. He watched her charming Lancel with eyes as green as the rope of emeralds around her slim white throat, and smiled a small sly smile to himself. I know your secret, Cersei, he thought. His sister had oft called upon the High Septon of late, to seek the blessings of the gods in their coming struggle with Lord Stannis… or so she would have him believe. In truth, after a brief call at the Great Sept of Baelor, Cersei would don a plain brown traveler's cloak and steal off to meet a certain hedge knight with the unlikely name of Ser Osmund Kettleblack, and his equally unsavory brothers Osney and Osfryd. Lancel had told him all about them. Cersei meant to use the Kettleblacks to buy her own force of sellswords.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="波隆护卫他穿过人群，来到姐姐和外甥们身边。瑟曦只当没他这号人，更加热烈地向堂弟展示微笑。他看着她朝蓝赛尔频送秋波，那双眼睛绿得和她白皙脖子上的翡翠项链一般，自己会心地笑了。我知道你的秘密，瑟曦，他心想。姐姐最近常拜访总主教，以求在与史坦尼斯即将来临的斗争中，诸神能够保佑他们…或者说她希望他如此相信。实际上，每当短暂造访贝勒大教堂后，瑟曦便会换上普通的棕色旅行斗篷，溜出去密会某个雇佣骑士，那骑士似乎名叫奥斯蒙·凯特布莱克爵士，他还有两个跟他一丘之貉的弟弟——奥斯尼和奥斯佛利。这一切蓝赛尔一五一十地告诉了他，瑟曦是打算利用凯特布莱克兄弟来收买一群自己的佣兵。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When at last the droning and mumbling was done, Tyrion took his farewell of the captain of Rob's Hammer. "Deliver my niece safely to Braavos, and there will be a knighthood waiting for you on your return," he promised.</div>

<div class="line_en">As he made his way down the steep plank to the quay, Tyrion could feel unkind eyes upon him. The galley rocked gently and the movement underfoot made his waddle worse than ever. I'll wager they'd love to snigger. No one dared, not openly, though he heard mutterings mingled with the creak of wood and rope and the rush of the river around the pilings. They do not love me, he thought. Well, small wonder. I'm well fed and ugly, and they are starving.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="提利昂沿着倾斜的木板走向码头，感觉到四周投来不善的目光。舰身轻轻摇晃，使他蹒跚得比以前更厉害。我打赌他们想笑。只是没人敢，至少没人敢公开嘲笑，但他听到小声的嘀咕，夹在木板绳索的吱嘎声和河流冲刷木桩的声音里。他们不喜欢我，他心想。好吧，这也难怪。我吃得饱，长得丑，而他们正饿着肚子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Horns blew fanfares as Lionstar and Lady Lyanna pushed out from shore, moving downriver to clear the way for Seaswift. A few cheers went up from the crush along the banks, as thin and ragged as the clouds scuttling overhead. Myrcella smiled and waved from the deck. Behind her stood Arys Oakheart, his white cloak streaming. The captain ordered lines cast off, and oars pushed the Seaswift out into the lusty current of the Blackwater Rush, where her sails blossomed in the wind-common white sails, as Tyrion had insisted, not sheets of Lannister crimson. Prince Tommen sobbed. "You mew like a suckling babe," his brother hissed at him. "Princes aren't supposed to cry."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="号角响起，狮星号和莱安娜小姐号驶出堤岸，顺流而下，为海捷号开道。岸边的人群发出几声稀落的欢呼，如空中的流云一般零星。弥赛菈站在甲板上微笑着挥手。亚历斯·奥克赫特爵士站在她身后，他的白袍随风飘动。船长下令松开缆绳，船桨推动海捷号驶入黑水河的急流中，背风张帆——普通的白帆，而非兰尼斯特的深红布料，这是提利昂的坚持。托曼王子啜泣起来。“你哭得像个吃奶的婴儿，”哥哥嘶声对他说，“做王子的不该哭。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Well, let her enjoy her plots. She was much sweeter when she thought she was outwitting him. The Kettleblacks would charm her, take her coin, and promise her anything she asked, and why not, when Bronn was matching every copper penny, coin for coin? Amiable rogues all three, the brothers were in truth much more skilled at deceit than they'd ever been at bloodletting. Cersei had managed to buy herself three hollow drums; they would make all the fierce booming sounds she required, but there was nothing inside. It amused Tyrion no end.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="好啊，就让她享受密谋的快感吧。每当她以为自己胜过他一筹，就会变得比较可爱。凯特布莱克兄弟会讨她喜欢，收她的钱，承诺她一切要求，何乐而不为呢？因为波隆会给出相同的价格，一分不差。这三兄弟外表亲切和蔼，实际却是些无赖，对于行骗远比作战要擅长。瑟曦等于替自己买到三面大鼓；要敲多响有多响，里面却空无一物。提利昂觉得有趣极了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Out on the river, Bold Wind unshipped her oars and glided downstream in the wake of Seaswift. Last came King Robert's Hammer, the might of the royal fleet… or at least that portion that had not fled to Dragonstone last year with Stannis. Tyrion had chosen the ships with care, avoiding any whose captains might be of doubtful loyalty, according to Varys… but as Varys himself was of doubtful loyalty, a certain amount of apprehension remained. I rely too much on Varys, he reflected. I need my own informers. Not that I'd trust them either. Trust would get you killed.</div>

<div class="line_en">The little fleet was well out into the bay when Cersei indicated that it was time to go. Bronn brought Tyrion's horse and helped him mount. That was Podrick Payne's task, but they had left Pod back at the Red Keep. The gaunt sellsword made for a much more reassuring presence than the boy would have.</div>

<div class="line_en">He wondered again about Littlefinger. There had been no word from Petyr Baelish since he had ridden off for Bitterbridge. That might mean nothing -- or everything. Even Varys could not say. The eunuch had suggested that perhaps Littlefinger had met some misfortune on the roads. He might even be slain. Tyrion had snorted in derision. "If Littlefinger is dead, then I'm a giant." More likely, the Tyrells were balking at the proposed marriage. Tyrion could scarcely blame them. If I were Mace 7)7rell, I would sooner have loffrey's head on a pike than his cock in my daughter.</div>

<div class="line_en">King Joffrey followed on a tall grey palfrey, a golden crown set upon his golden curls. Sansa Stark rode a chesnut mare at his side, looking neither right nor left, her thick auburn hair flowing to her shoulders beneath a net of moonstones.

<div class="line_en">The unshaven and the unwashed stared at the riders with dull resentment from behind the line of spears. I like this not one speck, Tyrion thought. Bronn had a score of sellswords scattered through the crowd with orders to stop any trouble before it started. Perhaps Cersei had similarly disposed her Kettleblacks. Somehow Tyrion did not think it would help much. If the fire was too hot, you could hardly keep the pudding from scorching by tossing a handful of raisins in the pot.</div>

<div class="line_en">Halfway along the route, a wailing woman forced her way between two watchmen and ran out into the street in front of the king and his companions, holding the corpse of her dead baby above her head. It was blue and swollen, grotesque, but the real horror was the mother's eyes. Joffrey looked for a moment as if he meant to ride her down, but Sansa Stark leaned over and said something to him. The king fumbled in his purse, and flung the woman a silver stag. The coin bounced off the child and rolled away, under the legs of the gold cloaks and into the crowd, where a dozen men began to fight for it. The mother never once blinked. Her skinny arms were trembling from the dead weight of her son.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="刚爬到一半，一名妇女哀嚎着从两名守卫间挤过来，冲到街道中央，将一具死婴高举过头，挡住国王和他的同伴们。尸体肿胀淤青，形状怪异，然而最恐怖的却是这个母亲的眼睛。一开始乔佛里似乎打算驱马将她踩倒，但珊莎·史塔克靠过去跟他说了些什么。于是国王在钱包里摸索，最后将一枚银鹿币朝女人丢去。银币在孩子身上弹开，滚过金袍卫士脚下，落入人群中，立时掀起一阵撕打争夺。可那母亲连眼都没眨一下，骨瘦如柴的手臂似乎很难支撑儿子的尸体，不住颤抖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They crossed Fishmonger's Square and rode along Muddy Way before turning onto the narrow, curving Hook to begin their climb up Aegon's High Hill. A few voices raised a cry of "Joffrey! All hail, all hail!" as the young king rode by, but for every man who picked up the shout, a hundred kept their silence. The Lannisters moved through a sea of ragged men and hungry women, breasting a tide of sullen eye. Just ahead of him, Cersei was laughing at something Lancel had said, though he suspected her merriment was feigned. She could not be oblivious to the unrest around them, but his sister always believed in putting on the brave show.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tyrion spurred to his sister's side, yelling, "Back to the castle. Now" Cersei gave a curt nod, and Ser Lancel unsheathed his sword. Ahead of the column, Jacelyn Bywater was roaring commands. His riders lowered their lances and drove forward in a wedge. The king was wheeling his palfrey around in anxious circles while hands reached past the line of gold cloaks, grasping for him. One managed to get hold of his leg, but only for an instant. Ser Mandon's sword slashed down, parting hand from wrist. "Ride!" Tyrion shouted at his nephew, giving the horse a sharp smack on the rump. The animal reared, trumpeting, and plunged ahead, the press shattering before him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tyrion drove into the gap hard on the king's hooves. Bronn kept pace, sword in hand. A jagged rock flew past his head as he rode, and a rotten cabbage exploded against Ser Mandon's shield. To their left, three gold cloaks went down under the surge, and then the crowd was rushing forward, trampling the fallen men. The Hound had vanished behind, though his riderless horse galloped beside them. Tyrion saw Aron Santagar pulled from the saddle, the gold-and-black Baratheon stag torn from his grasp. Ser Balon Swann dropped the Lannister lion to draw his longsword. He slashed right and left as the fallen banner was ripped apart, the thousand ragged pieces swirling away like crimson leaves in a stormwind. In an instant they were gone. Someone staggered in front of Joffrey's horse and shrieked as the king rode him down. Whether it had been man, woman, or child Tyrion could not have said. Joffrey was galloping at his side, whey-faced, with Ser Mandon Moore a white shadow on his left.</div>

Horas Redwyne brought in Lady Tanda, half crazed with fear for her daughter Lollys, who had been knocked from the saddle and left behind. Lord Gyles, more grey of face than ever, stammered out a tale of seeing the High Septon spilled from his litter, screeching prayers as the crowd swept over him. Jalabhar Xho said he thought he'd seen Ser Preston Greenfield of the Kingsguard riding back toward the High Septon's overturned litter, but he was not certain.</div>

They're half-trained and undisciplined, and what loyalty they have is to their own skins. If it comes to battle, they'll not hold, I fear."</div>

<div class="line_en">"My men are largely drawn from the smallfolk. They walk the same streets, drink in the same winesinks, spoon down their bowls of brown in the same pot-shops. Your eunuch must have told you, there is small love for the Lannisters in King's Landing. Many still remember how your lord father sacked the city, when Aerys opened the gates to him. They whisper that the gods are punishing us for the sins of your House -- for your brother's murder of King Aerys, for the butchery of Rhaegar's children, for the execution of Eddard Stark and the savagery of Joffrey's justice. Some talk openly of how much better things were when Robert was king, and hint that times would be better again with Stannis on the throne. In pot-shops and winesinks and brothels, you hear these things -- and in the barracks and guardhalls as well, I fear."</div>

Your sister and the eunuch were here when times were better under King Robert, but you were not. They say that you've filled the city with swaggering sellswords and unwashed savages, brutes who take what they want and follow no laws but their own. They say you exiled Janos Slynt because you found him too bluff and honest for your liking. They say you threw wise and gentle Pycelle into the dungeons when he dared raise his voice against you.
