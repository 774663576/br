<div class="line_en">The three weeks which the appointment lasted drew to an end. Philip had attended sixty-two cases, and he was tired out. When he came home about ten o'clock on his last night he hoped with all his heart that he would not be called out again. He had not had a whole night's rest for ten days. The case which he had just come from was horrible. He had been fetched by a huge, burly man, the worse for liquor, and taken to a room in an evil-smelling court, which was filthier than any he had seen: it was a tiny attic; most of the space was taken up by a wooden bed, with a canopy of dirty red hangings, and the ceiling was so low that Philip could touch it with the tips of his fingers; with the solitary candle that afforded what light there was he went over it, frizzling up the bugs that crawled upon it. The woman was a blowsy creature of middle age, who had had a long succession of still-born children. It was a story that Philip was not unaccustomed to: the husband had been a soldier in India; the legislation forced upon that country by the prudery of the English public had given a free run to the most distressing of all diseases; the innocent suffered. Yawning, Philip undressed and took a bath, then shook his clothes over the water and watched the animals that fell out wriggling. He was just going to get into bed when there was a knock at the door, and the hospital porter brought him a card.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sixteen shillings a week was not much to keep a wife and child on. The room the couple lived in showed that their poverty was extreme.

<div class="line_en">She had given her age as eighteen on the card, but when they were very young they often put on a year or two. Also she was pretty, which was rare in those classes in which the constitution has been undermined by bad food, bad air, and unhealthy occupations; she had delicate features and large blue eyes, and a mass of dark hair done in the elaborate fashion of the coster girl. She and her husband were very nervous.</div>

<div class="line_en">Now that he saw him better Philip was surprised again at his boyish air: you felt that he should be larking in the street with the other lads instead of waiting anxiously for the birth of a child. The hours passed, and it was not till nearly two that the baby was born. Everything seemed to be going satisfactorily; the husband was called in, and it touched Philip to see the awkward, shy way in which he kissed his wife; Philip packed up his things. Before going he felt once more his patient's pulse.</div>

<div class="line_en">He looked at her quickly: something had happened. In cases of emergency the S. O. C.-- senior obstetric clerk -- had to be sent for; he was a qualified man, and the `district' was in his charge. Philip scribbled a note, and giving it to the husband, told him to run with it to the hospital; he bade him hurry, for his wife was in a dangerous state. The man set off. Philip waited anxiously; he knew the woman was bleeding to death; he was afraid she would die before his chief arrived; he took what steps he could. He hoped fervently that the S. O. C. would not have been called elsewhere. The minutes were interminable. He came at last, and, while he examined the patient, in a low voice asked Philip questions. Philip saw by his face that he thought the case very grave. His name was Chandler. He was a tall man of few words, with a long nose and a thin face much lined for his age. He shook his head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他大喊一声，立刻看了看产妇的脸，心里暗道一声大事不妙。遇到这样的紧急情况，必须去找医院里的高级产科医师。他们是已经取得从医资格的医生，负责管理整个片区。菲利普草草写了张纸条，让丈夫拿上它快些跑去医院。他千叮咛万嘱咐，产妇现在危在旦夕，一定要尽快赶到医院。丈夫一溜烟跑走了，留下菲利普急得像热锅上的蚂蚁。产妇正在大出血，也许就此再也醒不过来了。菲利普害怕她在高级医师来到之前就咽了气。他把能做的急救手段都做了一遍，盼着高级医师正在医院，没去别地出诊。几分钟的时间像是过了几年。医师终于到了，给病人做了检查，低声问了菲利普几个问题。菲利普从他的表情里就能看出情况确实非常严重。医师名叫钱德勒，是个沉默寡言的大个子，鼻子很长，瘦削的脸盘上爬满皱纹，比他实际年龄看上去要老得多。他摇了摇头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There were no curtains on the windows, and gradually the night seemed to lighten; it was not yet the dawn, but the dawn was at hand. Chandler was keeping the woman alive by all the means in his power, but life was slipping away from her, and suddenly she died. The boy who was her husband stood at the end of the cheap iron bed with his hands resting on the rail; he did not speak; but he looked very pale and once or twice Chandler gave him an uneasy glance, thinking he was going to faint: his lips were gray. The midwife sobbed noisily, but he took no notice of her. His eyes were fixed upon his wife, and in them was an utter bewilderment. He reminded you of a dog whipped for something he did not know was wrong. When Chandler and Philip had gathered together their things Chandler turned to the husband.</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip nodded and passed. He leaned against the parapet and looked towards the morning. At that hour the great city was like a city of the dead. The sky was cloudless, but the stars were dim at the approach of day; there was a light mist on the river, and the great buildings on the north side were like palaces in an enchanted island. A group of barges was moored in midstream. It was all of an unearthly violet, troubling somehow and awe-inspiring; but quickly everything grew pale, and cold, and gray. Then the sun rose, a ray of yellow gold stole across the sky, and the sky was iridescent. Philip could not get out of his eyes the dead girl lying on the bed, wan and white, and the boy who stood at the end of it like a stricken beast. The bareness of the squalid room made the pain of it more poignant. It was cruel that a stupid chance should have cut off her life when she was just entering upon it; but in the very moment of saying this to himself, Philip thought of the life which had been in store for her, the bearing of children, the dreary fight with poverty, the youth broken by toil and deprivation into a slatternly middle age -- he saw the pretty face grow thin and white, the hair grow scanty, the pretty hands, worn down brutally by work, become like the claws of an old animal -- then, when the man was past his prime, the difficulty of getting jobs, the small wages he had to take; and the inevitable, abject penury of the end: she might be energetic, thrifty, industrious, it would not have saved her; in the end was the workhouse or subsistence on the charity of her children. Who could pity her because she had died when life offered so little?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普点点头，从警察的身边走过。他靠在桥栏上静等日出。此时此刻，这座伟大的城市死气沉沉。天上不见云彩，星星在将亮未亮的空中显得黯淡无光。河面上薄雾轻笼，河流中段停泊了几艘驳船，北岸那些高大宏伟的楼房好似矗立在魔幻岛屿上的神秘宫殿。这景致是仙境般的紫罗兰色，莫名骚动，令人敬畏。很快，万物都变为清浅的灰色，冷冷的调子，苍白而淡漠。太阳自河面升起，一道金黄色的带子漂在天边，整片天空五彩斑斓。菲利普的眼前总是闪过那个惨死在床上的女孩，那冰冷的身体和苍白的皮肤；还有站在床脚，像个受了伤的野兽一样的男孩。他们寒酸的小屋里空空荡荡，衬得这死亡之痛更加剧烈。女孩的生命才刚刚开始，她还站在门槛，就因为命运之神的愚蠢而告别人世。多么残忍啊！就在他唏嘘不已之时，却忽然想到，就算女孩活下来了，将来面对的人生也无非是这般样子：生育儿女、对抗贫穷；在劳碌中度过青春，人到中年才觉察到自己芳华尽失，变为一个不修边幅的邋遢妇人。菲利普似乎看到那张俏丽的面庞一点点消瘦、苍白，茂密的头发脱得稀稀拉拉，白皙修长的双手因为劳作变得粗糙丑陋，活像两只老兽的爪子。而男孩也不再年轻，找不到称心的工作，只能勉强挣回微薄的工资。他们最终所面临的也将是那无从回避的赤贫。也许女孩是个精力满满、省吃俭用、吃苦耐劳的人，可这也无法改变她既定的命运。最终她无非是要一路沦落到济贫院，在那里结束残生，或者依靠儿女的施舍，苟延残喘。如果生命不能给予她什么，又何必怜悯她的离开？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They arrived at the hospital, and the S. O. C. went in to see if anyone wanted him. Philip walked on. It had been very hot all the day before, and even now in the early morning there was a balminess in the air. The street was very still. Philip did not feel inclined to go to bed. It was the end of his work and he need not hurry. He strolled along, glad of the fresh air and the silence; he thought that he would go on to the bridge and look at day break on the river. A policeman at the corner bade him good-morning. He knew who Philip was from his bag.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们路过医院，钱德勒医师准备进去看看是否有人在等他，菲利普就一个人继续往前走。前一天天气炎热，现在虽然到了日出之际，空气里还是暖烘烘的。大街上悄无一人。他还不想回家，既然工作已经结束，就没必要急着休息了。他沿着马路慢悠悠地散步，享受着这空气新鲜、万物寂静的清晨。他想跑去桥上，看着太阳从河面升起。街角的警察向他问了句早上好，他看到那个黑包，猜出菲利普是位医生。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But pity was inane. Philip felt it was not that which these people needed. They did not pity themselves. They accepted their fate. It was the natural order of things. Otherwise, good heavens! otherwise they would swarm over the river in their multitude to the side where those great buildings were, secure and stately. and they would pillage, burn, and sack. But the day, tender and pale, had broken now, and the mist was tenuous; it bathed everything in a soft radiance; and the Thames was gray, rosy, and green; gray like mother-of-pearl and green like the heart of a yellow rose. The wharfs and store-houses of the Surrey Side were massed in disorderly loveliness. The scene was so exquisite that Philip's heart beat passionately. He was overwhelmed by the beauty of the world. Beside that nothing seemed to matter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="怜悯是没有意义的。菲利普觉得这些人并不需要他人的怜悯之情。他们甚至都不会怜悯自己。他们坦然接受命运的安排，深谙“天行有常”之道。再者说，如果不这样坦然接受……老天啊！如果不能坦然接受的话，他们也许就成群成群地扎进河里，跑到对岸那些高楼大厦里面纵火抢劫了。纤弱而苍白的清晨终于到了，晨雾愈发稀薄，沐浴在细密露珠下的一切看上去都散发着淡淡光辉。泰晤士河是清冷的灰色，是娇艳的红，是翠嫩的绿。灰如珍珠母的贝壳，绿如黄玫瑰的花心。萨里郡那边的码头库房凌乱地挤在一起，竟让人觉得别有一种美丽。眼前的景色如此纤妙，让菲利普心跳加速。他甘愿为这世上的美折腰臣服。与之相比，一切都不那么重要了。">查看中文翻译</div>
