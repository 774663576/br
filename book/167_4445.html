<div class="line_en">The queen was not disposed to wait on Varys. "Treason is vile enough," she declared furiously, "but this is barefaced naked villainy, and I do not need that mincing eunuch to tell me what must be done with villains."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="太后没性子等瓦里斯，“叛国已是罪不容诛。”她怒气冲天地宣布，“而这根本是下三滥的恶棍行径，我用不着那个装腔作势的太监来教我如何处置恶棍。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I imagine Father's heard rather more than a hint by now," Tyrion said dryly. "Doubtless Stannis sent a bird to Casterly Rock, and another to Harrenhal. As for burning the letters, to what point? The song is sung, the wine is spilled, the wench is pregnant. And this is not as dire as it seems, in truth."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我看老爸而今听到的只怕不是一点风声而已，”提利昂冷冷地说，“想必史坦尼斯早就派了鸟去凯岩城和赫伦堡。至于把信烧掉，有什么意义呢？正所谓覆水难收，寄出去的信已经收不回来，何况说实话，信里写的其实也没那么糟。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Maester Frenken received the first missive at Castle Stokeworth," Grand Maester Pycelle explained. "The second copy came through Lord Gyles."</div>

<div class="line_en">Pycelle cleared his throat. "These words often appear in letters and documents from the Free Cities. They mean no more than, let us say, written in the sight of god. The god of the red priests. It is their usage, I do believe."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="派席尔清清喉咙，“这句话时常在自由贸易城邦的书信和文件中出现，它的意思嘛，就类似‘写于诸神见证之下’，这里的‘真主’指的是红袍僧信奉的神。我相信这是他们的习惯用法。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Only because you're guilty. It was astonishing to see how angry Cersei could wax over accusations she knew perfectly well to be true. If we lose the war, she ought to take up mummery, she has a gift for it. Tyrion waited until she was done and said, "Stannis must have some pretext to justify his rebellion. What did you expect him to write? 'Joffrey is my brother's trueborn son and heir, but I mean to take his throne for all that'?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="难道他说错了吗？瑟曦明知这些指控完全属实，却依旧作气如此，真叫人大开眼界。倘若我们打输了这场仗，她应该转行去演戏，她实在很有天分。“史坦尼斯需要藉口来使他的叛乱合法化，你指望他写什么？‘乔佛里王子乃我长兄之嫡子和合法继承人，我将起兵与之争夺王位’？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Cersei turned on him in green-eyed fury. "Are you utterly witless? Did you read what he says? The boy Joffrey, he calls him. And he dares to accuse me of incest, adultery, and treason!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="瑟曦转身，睁大那双碧眼怒视他，“你到底有没有脑筋？你有没有看他写了些什么？他称我儿子为‘男童乔佛里’，还竟敢指控我乱伦、通奸和叛国！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Why, sister, he never claims Jaime paid you. Tyrion made a show of glancing over the writing again. There had been some niggling phrase… "Done in the Light of the Lord," he read. "A queer choice of words, that."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes, yes," the queen said impatiently, "but first we must stop this filth from spreading further. The council must issue an edict. Any man heard speaking of incest or calling Joff a bastard should lose his tongue for it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好好好，”太后不耐烦地说，“但我们先得阻止这龌龊东西继续散播，发布谕令，谁敢说起乱伦，或指称小乔为私生子，就把谁的舌头拔掉。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"A prudent measure," said Grand Maester Pycelle, his chain of office clinking as he nodded.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“什么也别做，由他们去说，过不多久自然烟消云散。只要稍有常识的人，都会把这事当成他们为夺权篡位所编造出的拙劣藉口。史坦尼斯可有证据？明明就是空穴来风，他上那儿找证据？”提利昂朝姐姐露出他最甜美的笑容。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“陛下，您弟弟说得没错，”培提尔·贝里席十指交搭，“假如我们试图制止谣言，只会显得真有其事，还不如嗤之以鼻，反正不过是个可笑的谎言。同时呢，我们可以以其人之道还治其人之身。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="瑟曦打量了他一眼，“怎么个还治其人之身？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"A tale of somewhat the same nature, perhaps. But more easily believed. Lord Stannis has spent most of his marriage apart from his wife. Not that I fault him, I'd do the same were I married to Lady Selyse. Nonetheless, if we put it about that her daughter is baseborn and Stannis a cuckold, well… the smallfolk are always eager to believe the worst of their lords, particularly those as stern, sour, and prickly proud as Stannis Baratheon."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“编个同样性质，但更易取信于人的故事。史坦尼斯大人自结婚以来，大半时间都离他妻子远远的。我不怪他，换我娶了赛丽丝当老婆，也会这么做。不过呢，假如我们宣传她的女儿其实是和野男人偷生，而史坦尼斯戴了绿帽，您想想看…对于主子的种种丑闻，老百姓向来乐于采信，更何况是史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩这种心高气傲又严酷无情的主子。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He has never been much loved, that's true." Cersei considered a moment. "So we pay him back in his own coin. Yes, I like this. Who can we name as Lady Selyse's lover? She has two brothers, I believe. And one of her uncles has been with her on Dragonstone all this time…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他从不受百姓爱戴，没错，”瑟曦沉吟半晌，“所以我们用同样的方法回敬他，嗯，这主意不错。我们该把谁说成赛丽丝夫人的情夫？记得她有两个兄弟，还有个伯伯一直跟着她待在龙石岛…”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Ser Axell Florent is her castellan." Loath as Tyrion was to admit it, Littlefinger's scheme had promise. Stannis had never been enamored of his wife, but he was bristly as a hedgehog where his honor was concerned and mistrustful by nature. If they could sow discord between him and his followers, it could only help their cause. "The child has the Florent ears, I'm told."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“亚赛尔·佛罗伦爵士是她的代理城主。”提利昂虽然极不愿意承认，却不得不同意小指头计谋可行。史坦尼斯纵然疏远妻子，但只要事关名誉，他就像只刺猬一般敏感，况且他天性多疑。如果能在他和佛罗伦家族之间种下猜忌的种子，对他们有利无害。“我听说他们的女儿生了对佛罗伦家的耳朵。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Littlefinger gestured languidly. "A trade envoy from Lys once observed to me that Lord Stannis must love his daughter very well, since he'd erected hundreds of statues of her all along the walls of Dragonstone. 'My lord,' I had to tell him, 'those are gargoyles.' " He chuckled. "Ser Axell might serve for Shireen's father, but in my experience, the more bizarre and shocking a tale the more apt it is to be repeated. Stannis keeps an especially grotesque fool, a lackwit with a tattooed face."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小指头慵懒地摆摆手，“有位里斯的贸易使节曾跟我说：”大人哪，史坦尼斯公爵一定非常疼爱他的女儿，瞧他在龙石岛的城墙上为她树立了几百座雕像。‘’哎，大人，‘我只好回答，’那都是石像鬼啊。‘“他笑了笑，”亚赛尔爵士固然可以充当希琳的父亲，但据我的经验，越是离奇古怪的故事，越容易口耳相传。史坦尼斯不是有个头脑简单、脸带刺青、样子特别畸形的弄臣吗？“">查看中文翻译</div>

They even look somewhat alike. Shireen has a mottled, half-frozen face as well."</div>

<div class="line_en">The Hand's private audience chamber was not so large as the king's, nor a patch on the vastness of the throne room, but Tyrion liked its Myrish rugs, wall hangings, and sense of intimacy. As he entered, his steward cried out, "Tyrion Lannister, Hand of the King." He liked that too. The gaggle of smiths, armorers, and ironmongers that Bronn had collected fell to their knees.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="首相的私人会客室比国王的小得多，自然更无法与王座厅相提并论，但提利昂喜欢其中的密尔地毯，墙壁上的挂饰，以及某种私密的氛围。他刚进门，总管便喊：“恭迎国王之手提利昂·兰尼斯特大人！”他也喜欢这种感觉。波隆聚集的这群铁匠、武器师和五金商人一听纷纷跪下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Very good. Help me dress." The doublet was black velvet covered with golden studs in the shape of lions' heads, the chain a loop of solid gold hands, the fingers of each clasping the wrist of the next. Pod brought him a cloak of crimson silk fringed in gold, cut to his height. On a normal man, it would be no more than a half cape.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“很好，过来帮我穿衣服。”外衣是黑天鹅绒料子，上面辍满了狮头形状的金色饰扣，那条项链则用只只实心金手串连而成，手指与手腕相扣。波德又为他披上一件深红的丝质金边披风，样式特别为他裁制，若给一般人穿，大概只能算短披风。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He hoisted himself up into the high seat under the round golden window and bid them rise. "Goodmen, I know you are all busy, so I will be succinct. Pod, if you please."

In a cushioned alcove, a drunken Tyroshi with a purple beard dandled a buxom young wench on his knee. He'd unlaced her bodice and was tilting his cup to pour a thin trickle of wine over her breasts so he might lap it off. Two other girls sat playing at tiles before a leaded glass window. The freckled one wore a chain of blue flowers in her honeyed hair. The other had skin as smooth and black as polished jet, wide dark eyes, small pointed breasts. They dressed in flowing silks cinched at the waist with beaded belts.

<div class="line_en">"I am certain of nothing in this fickle and treacherous world, my lord. Chataya has no cause to love the queen, though, and she knows that she has you to thank for ridding her of Allar Deem. Shall we go?" He started down the tunnel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“大人啊，在这个变幻莫测，诡谲难料的世界上，我什么都不敢确定。不过呢，莎塔雅对太后素无好感，她也知道之所以能除去亚拉尔·狄姆这个讨厌鬼，全是拜您所赐。我们走吧？”他迈开步伐朝隧道远端走去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Almost too much so," admitted Tyrion. "You're certain this woman can be relied on?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“满意极了。”提利昂表示，“你确定这女人值得信赖？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Even his walk is different, Tyrion observed. The scent of sour wine and garlic clung to Varys instead of lavender. "I like this new garb of yours," he offered as they went.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他连走路的方式都变了，提利昂察觉。瓦里斯浑身散发着劣酒和大蒜的味道，而非平日的薰衣草香。“我挺喜欢你这套新行头，”途中提利昂开口道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The work I do does not permit me to travel the streets amid a column of knights. So when I leave the castle, I adopt more suitable guises, and thus live to serve you longer."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我的工作不允许我在大批骑士簇拥下穿越大街小巷，所以每次出城，我便扮成不同的身份，如此才能活得长久，继续为您效力。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Your sister would not approve, my lord."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“大人，恐怕令姐不同意。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"My sister would soil her smallclothes." He smiled in the dark. "I saw no signs of any of her spies skulking after me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“老姐会吓得尿裤子。”他在黑暗中微笑，“照我沿路看来，她的眼线没跟住我。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I am pleased to hear it, my lord. Some of your sister's hirelings are mine as well, unbeknownst to her. I should hate to think they had grown so sloppy as to be seen."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“大人，听你这么说，我很高兴。令姐的手下多半也是我的人，只是她不知道罢了。若是他们笨手笨脚，被人发现，我可不会喜欢。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Little birds fly through many a dark tunnel. Careful, the steps are steep."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“小小鸟儿总往黑暗的通道里飞嘛。小心，楼梯陡着呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, I'd hate to think I was climbing through wardrobes and suffering the pangs of frustrated lust all for naught."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哎，若是这么憋住一身欲火，大费周章地爬过衣橱，结果半点用也没有，我也不会喜欢。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The tunnel was dug for another King's Hand, whose honor would not allow him to enter such a house openly. Chataya has closely guarded the knowledge of its existence."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“通道是另一位首相挖的，因为自重身份，他不愿光明正大地来这里。对于这个通道，莎塔雅可是守口如瓶。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They emerged through a trap at the back of a stable, having come perhaps a distance of three blocks under Rhaenys's Hill. A horse whickered in his stall when Tyrion let the door slam shut. Varys blew out the candle and set it on a beam and Tyrion gazed about. A mule and three horses occupied the stalls. He waddled over to the piebald gelding and took a look at his teeth. "Old," he said, "and I have my doubts about his wind."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们从一间马厩后的暗门走出，大约在雷妮丝丘陵下穿越了三条街的距离。提利昂把门轰地一声关上，栏里有匹马嘶鸣开来。瓦里斯吹熄蜡烛，将其放上梁架。提利昂环顾四周，马厩共有一头驴和三匹马。他跛着脚走到那匹花斑马旁，看了看马的牙齿。“这是匹老马，”他说，“只怕一跑就要断气。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Scarcely for naught," Varys assured him. "They know you are here. Whether any will be bold enough to enter Chataya's in the guise of patrons I cannot say, but I find it best to err on the side of caution."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“决不会没用。”瓦里斯向他保证，“他们的确知道你在这里，至于会不会有人大胆到装成恩客，闯进莎塔雅的妓院里来，我虽不敢说，但小心谨慎总是没错。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I plan to… after today. At the moment, though, Shae awaits me." He had put her up in a walled manse at the far northeast corner of King's Landing, not far from the sea, but he had not dared visit her there for fear of being followed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“正和我意…往后一定采纳。此时此刻嘛，雪伊正等着我呢。”他把她安顿在君临东北角的一座大宅，房子筑有围墙，离海不远，可他不敢去那里探望她，生怕被人跟踪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Which horse will you have?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“您骑哪匹马？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He is not a mount to carry you into battle, true," Varys replied, "but he will serve, and attract no notice. As will the others. And the stableboys see and hear only the animals." The eunuch took a cloak from a peg. It was roughspun, sun-faded, and threadbare, but very ample in its cut. "If you will permit me." When he swept it over Tyrion's shoulders it enveloped him head to heel, with a cowl that could be pulled forward to drown his face in shadows. "Men see what they expect to see," Varys said as he fussed and pulled. "Dwarfs are not so common a sight as children, so a child is what they will see. A boy in an old cloak on his father's horse, going about his father's business. Though it would be best if you came most often by night."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“它的确不是打仗的料，”瓦里斯答道，“但用来代步足矣，且不会引人注目。其他几匹也一样，至于那马厩小厮，他眼中所见，耳中所闻，都只有动物而已。”太监从墙上挂钉取下一件斗篷，斗篷是粗布织成，被太阳晒得褪了颜色，破旧不堪，惟有剪裁十分宽松。“希望您别嫌弃。”说着他为提利昂披上斗篷，将他从头到脚包裹住，还把兜帽拉下，让脸沉浸在阴影中。“一般而言，人只会看到自己想看的东西，”瓦里斯一边为他穿衣，一边说，“侏儒不像小孩那么寻常可见，所以他们眼中所见只是一个身穿旧斗篷的小男孩，骑着老爸的马，外出替他跑腿。话虽如此，您还是晚上来比较保险。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tyrion shrugged. "This one will do well enough."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="提利昂耸耸肩，“就这匹罢。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你怀疑我？不，不是我说的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tyrion adjusted the heavy cloak and paced restlessly. "You missed a lively council. Stannis has crowned himself, it seems."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我来为您配鞍。”瓦里斯自挂钉上取下鞍辔。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No. But why should I betray a secret I have kept so long? It is one thing to deceive a king, and quite another to hide from the cricket in the rushes and the little bird in the chimney. Besides, the bastards were there for all to see."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不会，但我既已保守了秘密这么久，何必把它讲出去？欺君罔上不难，但要瞒过草丛里的蟋蟀和烟囱里的小小鸟儿，可没那么容易。更何况那些私生子就摆在那里，大家不都看得到？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Perhaps he read a book and looked at the color of a bastard's hair, as Ned Stark did, and Jon Arryn before him. Or perhaps someone whispered it in his ear." The eunuch's laugh was not his usual giggle, but deeper and more throaty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“或许他读过什么书，又看到劳勃私生子的发色，就像奈德·史塔克，还有之前的琼恩·艾林一样。又或许有人告诉他啰。”太监的笑声不若他寻常的咯咯笑，而是一种更深沉、更粗嘎的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He fathered eight, to the best of my knowing," Varys said as he wrestled with the saddle. "Their mothers were copper and honey, chestnut and butter, yet the babes were all black as ravens… and as ill-omened, it would seem. So when Joffrey, Myrcella, and Tommen slid out between your sister's thighs, each as golden as the sun, the truth was not hard to glimpse."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“就我所知，他生了八个。”瓦里斯一边摆弄鞍辔，一边说，“不管孩子的娘头发是古铜色、蜂蜜色、栗子色，还是奶油黄，生下的孩子发色全黑得跟乌鸦一样…敢情他们的运气也和乌鸦的消息差不多。你瞧，乔佛里、弥赛拉和托曼从令姐的肚子里蹦出来时，每个人的头发都金黄得像太阳，事实不就显而易见了吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tyrion shook his head. If she had borne only one child for her husband, it would have been enough to disarm suspicion… but then she would not have been Cersei. "If you were not this whisperer, who was?"</div>
