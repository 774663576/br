<div class="line_en">A solitary figure was coming towards him from the other end of the long, brightly-lit corridor. It was the girl with dark hair. Four days had gone past since the evening when he had run into her outside the junk-shop. As she came nearer he saw that her right arm was in a sling, not noticeable at a distance because it was of the same colour as her overalls. Probably she had crushed her hand while swinging round one of the big kaleidoscopes on which the plots of novels were "roughed in". It was a common accident in the Fiction Department.</div>

<div class="line_en">They were perhaps four metres apart when the girl stumbled and fell almost flat on her face. A sharp cry of pain was wrung out of her. She must have fallen right on the injured arm. Winston stopped short. The girl had risen to her knees. Her face had turned a milky yellow colour against which her mouth stood out redder than ever. Her eyes were fixed on his, with an appealing expression that looked more like fear than pain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他们相隔约四米远的时候，那女孩绊了一下，几乎趴倒在地。她发出一声痛苦的尖叫。她跌倒的时候必定又碰及了那只伤臂。温斯顿马上停步。女孩跪着起身。她脸色发黄，而她的嘴唇则显得比以往更红润。她眼睛盯着他，脸上露出恳求的表情，看上去更像是害怕而不是疼痛。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A curious emotion stirred in Winston's heart. In front of him was an enemy who was trying to kill him: in front of him, also, was a human creature, in pain and perhaps with a broken bone. Already he had instinctively started forward to help her. In the moment when he had seen her fall on the bandaged arm, it had been as though he felt the pain in his own body.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="温斯顿心中涌起一种奇怪的感情。他面对一个曾要置他于死地的仇敌；他也面对一个忍受疼痛，也许伤了骨头的人。出于本能，他已经准备上去帮助她。当他看见她跌倒时碰到那只伤臂时，他仿佛感觉到自己的身体一阵疼痛。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And with that she walked on in the direction in which she had been going, as briskly as though it had really been nothing. The whole incident could not have taken as much as half a minute. Not to let one's feelings appear in one's face was a habit that had acquired the status of an instinct, and in any case they had been standing straight in front of a telescreen when the thing happened. Nevertheless it had been very difficult not to betray a momentary surprise, for in the two or three seconds while he was helping her up the girl had slipped something into his hand. There was no question that she had done it intentionally. It was something small and flat. As he passed through the lavatory door he transferred it to his pocket and felt it with the tips of his fingers. It was a scrap of paper folded into a square.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她又朝着原来的方向走去，步子轻快，好像真的没什么。事情是在片刻之间发生的。不流露表情已习惯成自然，何况刚才他们正好站在电幕面前。然而，要不露出一点惊讶是很难的，因为就在他扶她站起来的瞬间，有什么东西塞到了他手里。无疑她是故意这么做的。这是个不起眼的小东西。当他走进厕所时，他把它放进口袋，用手指摸摸它。这是折成小方块的一张纸。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He went back to his cubicle, sat down, threw the fragment of paper casually among the other papers on the desk, put on his spectacles and hitched the speakwrite towards him. "Five minutes," he told himself, "five minutes at the very least!" His heart bumped in his breast with frightening loudness. Fortunately the piece of work he was engaged on was mere routine, the rectification of a long list of figures, not needing close attention.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他回到工作间，坐下来，将那张纸片随意地放在桌上其他纸张之间，戴上眼镜，将述写器拉过来。“五分钟，”他对自己说，“至少五分钟！”他的心在胸膛里猛烈地跳着。幸好他手头要做的只是例行公事，修改一长串数字，无需太花心思。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Whatever was written on the paper, it must have some kind of political meaning. So far as he could see there were two possibilities. One, much the more likely, was that the girl was an agent of the Thought Police, just as he had feared. He did not know why the Thought Police should choose to deliver their messages in such a fashion, but perhaps they had their reasons. The thing that was written on the paper might be a threat, a summons, an order to commit suicide, a trap of some description. But there was another, wilder possibility that kept raising its head, though he tried vainly to suppress it. This was, that the message did not come from the Thought Police at all, but from some kind of underground organisation. Perhaps the Brotherhood existed after all! Perhaps the girl was part of it! No doubt the idea was absurd, but it had sprung into his mind in the very instant of feeling the scrap of paper in his hand. It was not till a couple of minutes later that the other, more probable explanation had occurred to him. And even now, though his intellect told him that the message probably meant death -- still, that was not what he believed, and the unreasonable hope persisted, and his heart banged, and it was with difficulty that he kept his voice from trembling as he murmured his figures into the speakwrite.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无论纸上写的是什么，一定和政治有关。他所能想到的有两种可能性。一是那女孩如他所担心的，是思想警察的一个特工，这种可能性最大。他不知道为什么思想警察会选择这种方式传递信息，但也许他们这么做事出有因。那纸条上写的可能是一个威胁、一份传讯、一条自杀令、一种什么圈套。但也有另一种可能，一种匪夷所思的可能，尽管他极力不去想它，但这种可能性还是钻进了他的头脑。这种可能性就是，纸条上的信息根本不是来自思想警察，而是来自某个地下组织。也许兄弟会确实存在！也许那女孩是兄弟会成员！这想法无疑是荒唐的，但他手里一碰到纸条，这想法就油然而生。而过了几分钟，他才想到另一种，也是更合理的解释。虽然理智告诉他，纸条上的信息可能意味着死亡——但这仍不是他所愿意相信的，不合情理的希望挥之不去，他的心猛烈地跳着，在向述写器低声输送数字时好不容易才不让声音颤抖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">While he stood at the urinal he managed, with a little more fingering, to get it unfolded. Obviously there must be a message of some kind written on it. For a moment he was tempted to take it into one of the water-closets and read it at once. But that would be shocking folly, as he well knew. There was no place where you could be more certain that the telescreens were watched continuously.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他站在小便池旁，他设法用手指把纸条摊开来。显然，纸上一定写着什么信息。他想立刻钻进厕所的隔间马上读起来。但他很清楚，这么做简直是愚蠢之极。因为你没有把握哪个地方可以躲过电幕的监控。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For several seconds he was too stunned even to throw the incriminating thing into the memory hole. When he did so, although he knew very well the danger of showing too much interest, he could not resist reading it once again, just to make sure that the words were really there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他一时惊呆了，以致没有马上把这件招祸的东西扔进内存洞。虽然他很清楚表现出过多的兴趣是很危险的事情，但他把纸条扔掉时还是忍不住又看了一遍，就想看清楚纸上真是这么写的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He rolled up the completed bundle of work and slid it into the pneumatic tube. Eight minutes had gone by. He re-adjusted his spectacles on his nose, sighed, and drew the next batch of work towards him, with the scrap of paper on top of it. He flattened it out. On it was written, in a large unformed handwriting:</div>

<div class="line_en">For the rest of the morning it was very difficult to work. What was even worse than having to focus his mind on a series of niggling jobs was the need to conceal his agitation from the telescreen. He felt as though a fire were burning in his belly. Lunch in the hot, crowded, noise-filled canteen was torment. He had hoped to be alone for a little while during the lunch hour, but as bad luck would have it the imbecile Parsons flopped down beside him, the tang of his sweat almost defeating the tinny smell of stew, and kept up a stream of talk about the preparations for Hate Week. He was particularly enthusiastic about a papier-mâché model of Big Brother's head, two metres wide, which was being made for the occasion by his daughter's troop of Spies. The irritating thing was that in the racket of voices Winston could hardly hear what Parsons was saying, and was constantly having to ask for some fatuous remark to be repeated. Just once he caught a glimpse of the girl, at a table with two other girls at the far end of the room. She appeared not to have seen him, and he did not look in that direction again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="上午的剩余时间就很难工作了。他不仅无法在一系列琐事上集中心思，更糟糕的是，还需要掩饰他的激动不让电幕察觉。他感到身体内好像有火在烧。在闷热、拥挤和嘈杂的食堂里吃饭简直是折磨。他希望在午餐时间能独自待一会儿，但不幸的是，那个蠢货帕森斯在他身边一屁股坐了下来，身上强烈的汗臭几乎盖过了炖菜的味道，接着滔滔不绝地说起如何准备仇恨周活动。他尤其热心于用纸做一个老大哥的头像模型，两米宽，这是为他女儿的少年侦察队做的。令人恼火的是，在四周的嘈杂声中，温斯顿几乎听不清帕森斯说什么，只好不断地请他把那些蠢话再重复一遍。只有一次他看见了那个女孩，她和另外两个女孩在食堂另一头的餐桌旁。她好像没有看见他，而他不便朝那个方向再看一眼。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The afternoon was more bearable. Immediately after lunch there arrived a delicate, difficult piece of work which would take several hours and necessitated putting everything else aside. It consisted in falsifying a series of production reports of two years ago, in such a way as to cast discredit on a prominent member of the Inner Party who was now under a cloud. This was the kind of thing that Winston was good at, and for more than two hours he succeeded in shutting the girl out of his mind altogether. Then the memory of her face came back, and with it a raging, intolerable desire to be alone. Until he could be alone it was impossible to think this new development out. Tonight was one of his nights at the Community Centre. He wolfed another tasteless meal in the canteen, hurried off to the Centre, took part in the solemn foolery of a "discussion group", played two games of table tennis, swallowed several glasses of gin and sat for half an hour through a lecture entitled "Ingsoc in relation to chess". His soul writhed with boredom, but for once he had had no impulse to shirk his evening at the Centre. At the sight of the words I love you the desire to stay alive had welled up in him, and the taking of minor risks suddenly seemed stupid. It was not till twenty-three hours, when he was home and in bed -- in the darkness, where you were safe even from the telescreen so long as you kept silent -- that he was able to think continuously.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a physical problem that had to be solved: how to get in touch with the girl and arrange a meeting. He did not consider any longer the possibility that she might be laying some kind of trap for him. He knew that it was not so, because of her unmistakable agitation when she handed him the note. Obviously she had been frightened out of her wits, as well she might be. Nor did the idea of refusing her advances even cross his mind. Only five nights ago he had contemplated smashing her skull in with a cobblestone; but that was of no importance. He thought of her naked, youthful body, as he had seen it in his dream. He had imagined her a fool like all the rest of them, her head stuffed with lies and hatred, her belly full of ice. A kind of fever seized him at the thought that he might lose her, the white youthful body might slip away from him! What he feared more than anything else was that she would simply change her mind if he did not get in touch with her quickly. But the physical difficulty of meeting was enormous. It was like trying to make a move at chess when you were already mated. Whichever way you turned, the telescreen faced you. Actually, all the possible ways of communicating with her had occurred to him within five minutes of reading the note; but now, with time to think, he went over them one by one, as though laying out a row of instruments on a table.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有待解决的是一个具体问题：怎样和她取得联系并安排一次见面？他不再认为她可能给他设置了某种圈套。他知道不是这么回事，因为她把纸条递给他时，她的激动不安是明白无误的。显然，她吓得够呛，谁都会害怕的。他心里甚至都没想到要拒绝她的示爱。仅仅五天前，他还想用一块鹅卵石砸她的脑袋，但这并不重要。他想到她裸露的充满青春活力的身体，正如他梦中所见。他曾想象她和其他人一样，是个傻瓜，脑袋里塞满了谎言和仇恨，冷如冰霜。一想到他可能失去她就感到极度恐慌，那白皙的青春胴体可能从他那儿滑落！他最害怕的是，她可能会改变主意，如果他不能很快和她联系的话。但见面的具体困难又难以估量。这就像在棋盘上你已被将死，但你竭力要挽回一样。无论你转向何方，电幕总对着你。实际上，他在读到纸条的五分钟内已经想到了同她见面的所有可能的方法，但眼下，他有时间来充分思考，便将这些方法逐一研究，就仿佛把工具排列在桌子上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Obviously the kind of encounter that had happened this morning could not be repeated. If she had worked in the Records Department it might have been comparatively simple, but he had only a very dim idea whereabouts in the building the Fiction Department lay, and he had no pretext for going there. If he had known where she lived, and at what time she left work, he could have contrived to meet her somewhere on her way home; but to try to follow her home was not safe, because it would mean loitering about outside the Ministry, which was bound to be noticed. As for sending a letter through the mails, it was out of the question. By a routine that was not even secret, all letters were opened in transit. Actually, few people ever wrote letters. For the messages that it was occasionally necessary to send, there were printed postcards with long lists of phrases, and you struck out the ones that were inapplicable. In any case he did not know the girl's name, let alone her address. Finally he decided that the safest place was the canteen. If he could get her at a table by herself, somewhere in the middle of the room, not too near the telescreens, and with a sufficient buzz of conversation all round -- if these conditions endured for, say, thirty seconds, it might be possible to exchange a few words.</div>

<div class="line_en">For a week after this, life was like a restless dream. On the next day she did not appear in the canteen until he was leaving it, the whistle having already blown. Presumably she had been changed onto a later shift. They passed each other without a glance. On the day after that she was in the canteen at the usual time, but with three other girls and immediately under a telescreen. Then for three dreadful days she did not appear at all. His whole mind and body seemed to be afflicted with an unbearable sensitivity, a sort of transparency, which made every movement, every sound, every contact, every word that he had to speak or listen to, an agony. Even in sleep he could not altogether escape from her image. He did not touch the diary during those days. If there was any relief, it was in his work, in which he could sometimes forget himself for ten minutes at a stretch. He had absolutely no clue as to what had happened to her. There was no enquiry he could make. She might have been vaporised, she might have committed suicide, she might have been transferred to the other end of Oceania: worst and likeliest of all, she might simply have changed her mind and decided to avoid him.</div>

<div class="line_en">The next day she reappeared. Her arm was out of the sling and she had a band of sticking plaster round her wrist. The relief of seeing her was so great that he could not resist staring directly at her for several seconds. On the following day he very nearly succeeded in speaking to her. When he came into the canteen she was sitting at a table well out from the wall, and was quite alone. It was early, and the place was not very full. The queue edged forward till Winston was almost at the counter, then was held up for two minutes because someone in front was complaining that he had not received his tablet of saccharine. But the girl was still alone when Winston secured his tray and began to make for her table. He walked casually towards her, his eyes searching for a place at some table beyond her. She was perhaps three metres away from him. Another two seconds would do it. Then a voice behind him called, "Smith!" He pretended not to hear. "Smith!" repeated the voice, more loudly. It was no use. He turned round. A blond-headed, silly-faced young man named Wilsher, whom he barely knew, was inviting him with a smile to a vacant place at his table. It was not safe to refuse. After having been recognised, he could not go and sit at a table with an unattended girl. It was too noticeable. He sat down with a friendly smile. The silly blond face beamed into his. Winston had a hallucination of himself smashing a pickaxe right into the middle of it. The girl's table filled up a few minutes later.</div>

<div class="line_en">But she must have seen him coming towards her, and perhaps she would take the hint. Next day he took care to arrive early. Sure enough, she was at a table in about the same place, and again alone. The person immediately ahead of him in the queue was a small, swiftly-moving, beetle-like man with a flat face and tiny, suspicious eyes. As Winston turned away from the counter with his tray, he saw that the little man was making straight for the girl's table. His hopes sank again. There was a vacant place at a table further away, but something in the little man's appearance suggested that he would be sufficiently attentive to his own comfort to choose the emptiest table. With ice at his heart Winston followed. It was no use unless he could get the girl alone. At this moment there was a tremendous crash. The little man was sprawling on all fours, his tray had gone flying, two streams of soup and coffee were flowing across the floor. He started to his feet with a malignant glance at Winston, whom he evidently suspected of having tripped him up. But it was all right. Five seconds later, with a thundering heart, Winston was sitting at the girl's table.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是她必定看出他朝她走去，也许她懂得这个暗示。第二天，他有意早一点到食堂。不出所料，她就坐在老地方附近的一张桌子旁，还是一个人。排在他前面的那个人是个小个子，甲虫一般，但动作敏捷，有着扁扁的脸，多疑的小眼睛。当温斯顿端着盘子转过身来，他看见那个小个子径直朝女孩的那张桌子走去。他的希望眼看又要落空。前面一张桌子有个空位子，但小个子的神态表明，他会执意挑一张最空的桌子。温斯顿心里凉了半截，只好跟着。除非和女孩坐在一起，否则说不上话。正在这时，突然砰的一声，小个子跌了个四脚朝天，手里的托盘飞了出去，热汤和咖啡在地上横流。他起身恶狠狠地瞪着温斯顿，显然怀疑温斯顿绊倒了他。不过不要紧。几秒钟后，怀着激烈的心跳，温斯顿在女孩的那张桌子旁坐了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He did not look at her. He unpacked his tray and promptly began eating. It was all-important to speak at once, before anyone else came, but now a terrible fear had taken possession of him. A week had gone by since she had first approached him. She would have changed her mind, she must have changed her mind! It was impossible that this affair should end successfully; such things did not happen in real life. He might have flinched altogether from speaking if at this moment he had not seen Ampleforth, the hairy-eared poet, wandering limply round the room with a tray, looking for a place to sit down. In his vague way Ampleforth was attached to Winston, and would certainly sit down at his table if he caught sight of him. There was perhaps a minute in which to act. Both Winston and the girl were eating steadily. The stuff they were eating was a thin stew, actually a soup, of haricot beans. In a low murmur Winston began speaking. Neither of them looked up; steadily they spooned the watery stuff into their mouths, and between spoonfuls exchanged the few necessary words in low expressionless voices.</div>

<div class="line_en">Winston was in Victory Square before the appointed time. He wandered round the base of the enormous fluted column, at the top of which Big Brother's statue gazed southward towards the skies where he had vanquished the Eurasian aeroplanes (the Eastasian aeroplanes, it had been, a few years ago) in the Battle of Airstrip One. In the street in front of it there was a statue of a man on horseback which was supposed to represent Oliver Cromwell. At five minutes past the hour the girl had still not appeared. Again the terrible fear seized upon Winston. She was not coming, she had changed her mind! He walked slowly up to the north side of the square and got a sort of pale-coloured pleasure from identifying St Martin's church, whose bells, when it had bells, had chimed "You owe me three farthings." Then he saw the girl standing at the base of the monument, reading or pretending to read a poster which ran spirally up the column. It was not safe to go near her until some more people had accumulated. There were telescreens all round the pediment. But at this moment there was a din of shouting and a zoom of heavy vehicles from somewhere to the left. Suddenly everyone seemed to be running across the square. The girl nipped nimbly round the lions at the base of the monument and joined in the rush. Winston followed. As he ran, he gathered from some shouted remarks that a convoy of Eurasian prisoners was passing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="温斯顿在约定的时间前来到胜利广场。他在纪念柱的巨大底座周边溜达，圆柱顶上是老大哥的塑像，朝南凝视着天空，他在“跑道一号”战役中，击落了欧亚国的飞机（几年前则是东亚国的飞机）。在纪念柱前面的街上，还有一座塑像，一个男子骑在马背上，据说代表了奥利弗·克伦威尔。七点过五分，那女孩还没有出现。温斯顿又感到一阵恐惧。她没有来，她变心了！他慢慢走到广场的北边，认出了圣马丁教堂，这才略为有些欣慰，那个教堂有大钟时，大钟曾经敲响过“你欠我三个法寻”。这时，他看见女孩站在纪念碑的底座旁，正看着或假装看着贴在圆柱上的一张宣传画。现在过去不安全，要等到她身边有了更多的人。广场四处都有电幕。但在此时，响起一阵喊声，又有重型车的声音从什么地方传来，向左边移动。突然，广场上的每个人都跑了起来。那女孩机敏地绕过纪念碑底座的石狮，加入了奔跑的人群。温斯顿跟了上去。他一边跑，一边从喊声中听出有几辆运送欧亚国俘虏的汽车经过。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Already a dense mass of people was blocking the south side of the square. Winston, at normal times the kind of person who gravitates to the outer edge of any kind of scrimmage, shoved, butted, squirmed his way forward into the heart of the crowd. Soon he was within arm's length of the girl, but the way was blocked by an enormous prole and an almost equally enormous woman, presumably his wife, who seemed to form an impenetrable wall of flesh. Winston wriggled himself sideways, and with a violent lunge managed to drive his shoulder between them. For a moment it felt as though his entrails were being ground to pulp between the two muscular hips, then he had broken through, sweating a little. He was next to the girl. They were shoulder to shoulder, both staring fixedly in front of them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="广场南边已有大群民众聚集起来。温斯顿通常只是在外围看看热闹，这时他推着，撞着，千方百计往人群里挤。很快他离那女孩只有一臂之遥了，但前面被一个魁梧的无产者及一个同样身材的女人——可能是他的老婆——挡住了，他们似乎组成了一道难于穿越的肉墙。温斯顿侧过身子，用足力气将肩膀挤进他们中间。他一时觉得他的五脏六腑就要被那两个肌肉发达的屁股碾成肉泥，随后他出了一身汗终于挤过去了。他来到了女孩的身边。他们肩并肩站着，两个人都眼光直直地望着前方。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A long line of trucks, with wooden-faced guards armed with sub-machine-guns standing upright in each corner, was passing slowly down the street. In the trucks little yellow men in shabby greenish uniforms were squatting, jammed close together. Their sad Mongolian faces gazed out over the sides of the trucks, utterly incurious. Occasionally when a truck jolted there was a clank-clank of metal: all the prisoners were wearing leg-irons. Truck-load after truck-load of the sad faces passed. Winston knew they were there, but he saw them only intermittently. The girl's shoulder, and her arm right down to the elbow, were pressed against his. Her cheek was almost near enough for him to feel its warmth. She had immediately taken charge of the situation, just as she had done in the canteen. She began speaking in the same expressionless voice as before, with lips barely moving, a mere murmur easily drowned by the din of voices and the rumbling of the trucks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="长长的一列车队正缓慢地从街上通过，手持冲锋枪，脸无表情的卫兵笔直站在卡车的四个角落。车上，那些小个的黄种人，穿着破烂的绿军装，蜷伏着挤作一团。他们可怜的蒙古人的脸木然地望着卡车外边，一点也不感到惊奇。偶尔有卡车震动一下，便会响起一阵丁当丁当的金属声，原来所有的俘虏都戴着脚镣。一卡车一卡车的悲哀的面孔经过。温斯顿知道他们是俘虏，但只是断断续续地看见他们。女孩的肩膀，还有她的上半只手臂紧靠着他。她的脸颊挨得很近，他几乎能感到她的热气。她很快就掌握了局面，就像在食堂里那样。她用先前那种不露声色的声音开始说话，嘴唇几乎不动，声音很轻，很容易就被人群的嘈杂声和卡车的隆隆声所淹没。">查看中文翻译</div>

A half-hour railway journey; turn left outside the station; two kilometres along the road; a gate with the top bar missing; a path across a field; a grass-grown lane; a track between bushes; a dead tree with moss on it. It was as though she had a map inside her head. "Can you remember all that?" she murmured finally.</div>

<div class="line_en">She need not have told him that. But for the moment they could not extricate themselves from the crowd. The trucks were still filing past, the people still insatiably gaping. At the start there had been a few boos and hisses, but it came only from the Party members among the crowd, and had soon stopped. The prevailing emotion was simply curiosity. Foreigners, whether from Eurasia or from Eastasia, were a kind of strange animal. One literally never saw them except in the guise of prisoners, and even as prisoners one never got more than a momentary glimpse of them. Nor did one know what became of them, apart from the few who were hanged as war-criminals: the others simply vanished, presumably into forced-labour camps. The round Mongol faces had given way to faces of a more European type, dirty, bearded and exhausted. From over scrubby cheekbones eyes looked into Winston's, sometimes with strange intensity, and flashed away again. The convoy was drawing to an end. In the last truck he could see an aged man, his face a mass of grizzled hair, standing upright with wrists crossed in front of him, as though he were used to having them bound together. It was almost time for Winston and the girl to part. But at the last moment, while the crowd still hemmed them in, her hand felt for his and gave it a fleeting squeeze.</div>

<div class="line_en">It could not have been ten seconds, and yet it seemed a long time that their hands were clasped together. He had time to learn every detail of her hand. He explored the long fingers, the shapely nails, the work-hardened palm with its row of callouses, the smooth flesh under the wrist. Merely from feeling it he would have known it by sight. In the same instant it occurred to him that he did not know what colour the girl's eyes were. They were probably brown, but people with dark hair sometimes had blue eyes. To turn his head and look at her would have been inconceivable folly. With hands locked together, invisible among the press of bodies, they stared steadily in front of them, and instead of the eyes of the girl, the eyes of the aged prisoner gazed mournfully at Winston out of nests of hair.</div>
