<div class="line_en">During January, February, and part of March, the deep snows, and, after their melting, the almost impassable roads, prevented our stirring beyond the garden walls, except to go to church; but within these limits we had to pass an hour every day in the open air. Our clothing was insufficient to protect us from the severe cold: we had no boots, the snow got into our shoes and melted there: our ungloved hands became numbed and covered with chilblains, as were our feet: I remember well the distracting irritation I endured from this cause every evening, when my feet inflamed; and the torture of thrusting the swelled, raw, and stiff toes into my shoes in the morning. Then the scanty supply of food was distressing: with the keen appetites of growing children, we had scarcely sufficient to keep alive a delicate invalid. From this deficiency of nourishment resulted an abuse, which pressed hardly on the younger pupils: whenever the famished great girls had an opportunity, they would coax or menace the little ones out of their portion. Many a time I have shared between two claimants the precious morsel of brown bread distributed at tea-time; and after relinquishing to a third half the contents of my mug of coffee, I have swallowed the remainder with an accompaniment of secret tears, forced from me by the exigency of hunger.</div>

<div class="line_en">My first quarter at Lowood seemed an age; and not the golden age either; it comprised an irksome struggle with difficulties in habituating myself to new rules and unwonted tasks. The fear of failure in these points harassed me worse than the physical hardships of my lot; though these were no trifles.</div>

<div class="line_en">How we longed for the light and heat of a blazing fire when we got back!

We set out cold, we arrived at church colder: during the morning service we became almost paralysed.

The other teachers, poor things, were generally themselves too much dejected to attempt the task of cheering others.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Sunday evening was spent in repeating, by heart, the Church Catechism, and the fifth, sixth, and seventh chapters of St. Matthew; and in listening to a long sermon, read by Miss Miller, whose irrepressible yawns attested her weariness. A frequent interlude of these performances was the enactment of the part of Eutychus by some half-dozen of little girls, who, overpowered with sleep, would fall down, if not out of the third loft, yet off the fourth form, and be taken up half dead. The remedy was, to thrust them forward into the centre of the schoolroom, and oblige them to stand there till the sermon was finished. Sometimes their feet failed them, and they sank together in a heap; they were then propped up with the monitors' high stools.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="星期天晚上我们要背诵教堂的教义问答和《马太福音》的第五、六、七章，还要听米勒小姐冗长的讲道，她禁不住哈欠连天，证明她也倦了。在这些表演中间，经常有一个插曲，六、七个小姑娘总要扮演犹推古的角色，她们因为困倦不堪，虽然不是从三楼上而是从第四排长凳上摔下来，扶起来时也已经半死了。补救办法是把她们硬塞到教室的中间，迫使她们一直站着，直至讲道结束。有时她们的双脚不听使唤，瘫下来缩作一团，于是便不得不用班长的高凳把她们支撑起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A little solace came at tea-time, in the shape of a double ration of bread -- a whole, instead of a half, slice -- with the delicious addition of a thin scrape of butter: it was the hebdomadal treat to which we all looked forward from Sabbath to Sabbath. I generally contrived to reserve a moiety of this bounteous repast for myself; but the remainder I was invariably obliged to part with.</div>

<div class="line_en">One afternoon (I had then been three weeks at Lowood), as I was sitting with a slate in my hand, puzzling over a sum in long division, my eyes, raised in abstraction to the window, caught sight of a figure just passing: I recognised almost instinctively that gaunt outline; and when, two minutes after, all the school, teachers included, rose en masse, it was not necessary for me to look up in order to ascertain whose entrance they thus greeted. A long stride measured the schoolroom, and presently beside Miss Temple, who herself had risen, stood the same black column which had frowned on me so ominously from the hearthrug of Gateshead. I now glanced sideways at this piece of architecture. Yes, I was right: it was Mr. Brocklehurst, buttoned up in a surtout, and looking longer, narrower, and more rigid than ever.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天下午（那时我到罗沃德已经三星期了），我手里拿了块写字板坐着，正为长除法中的一个总数发窘，眼睛呆呆地望着窗外，看到有一个人影闪过。我几乎本能地认出了这瘦瘦的轮廓。因此两分钟后，整个学校的人，包括教师在内都全体起立时，我没有必要抬起头来后过究竟，便知道他们在迎接谁进屋了。这人大步流星走进教室。眨眼之间，在早已起立的坦普尔小姐身边，便竖起了同一根黑色大柱，就是这根柱子曾在盖茨黑德的壁炉地毯上不祥地对我皱过眉。这时我侧目瞟了一眼这个建筑物。对，我没有看错，就是那个布罗克赫斯特先生，穿着紧身长外衣，扣紧了钮扣，看上去越发修长、狭窄和刻板了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I have not yet alluded to the visits of Mr. Brocklehurst; and indeed that gentleman was from home during the greater part of the first month after my arrival; perhaps prolonging his stay with his friend the archdeacon: his absence was a relief to me. I need not say that I had my own reasons for dreading his coming: but come he did at last.</div>

<div class="line_en">I had my own reasons for being dismayed at this apparition; too well I remembered the perfidious hints given by Mrs. Reed about my disposition, &amp;c.; the promise pledged by Mr. Brocklehurst to apprise Miss Temple and the teachers of my vicious nature. All along I had been dreading the fulfilment of this promise, -- I had been looking out daily for the "Coming Man," whose information respecting my past life and conversation was to brand me as a bad child for ever: now there he was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="见到这个幽灵，我有理由感到丧气。我记得清清楚楚，里德太太曾恶意地暗示过我的品行等等，布罗克赫斯特先生曾答应把我的恶劣本性告诉坦普尔小姐和教师们。我一直害怕这一诺言会得到实现——每天都提防着这个“行将到来的人”。他的谈话和对我往事的透露，会使我一辈子落下个坏孩子的恶名，而现在他终于来了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I suppose, Miss Temple, the thread I bought at Lowton will do; it struck me that it would be just of the quality for the calico chemises, and I sorted the needles to match. You may tell Miss Smith that I forgot to make a memorandum of the darning needles, but she shall have some papers sent in next week; and she is not, on any account, to give out more than one at a time to each pupil: if they have more, they are apt to be careless and lose them. And, O ma'am! I wish the woollen stockings were better looked to! -- when I was here last, I went into the kitchen-garden and examined the clothes drying on the line; there was a quantity of black hose in a very bad state of repair: from the size of the holes in them I was sure they had not been well mended from time to time."</div>

<div class="line_en">He stood at Miss Temple's side; he was speaking low in her ear: I did not doubt he was making disclosures of my villainy; and I watched her eye with painful anxiety, expecting every moment to see its dark orb turn on me a glance of repugnance and contempt. I listened too; and as I happened to be seated quite at the top of the room, I caught most of what he said: its import relieved me from immediate apprehension.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他站在坦普尔小姐身旁，跟她在小声耳语。毫无疑问他在说我坏话，我急切而痛苦地注视着她的目光，无时无刻不期待着她乌黑的眸子转向我，投来厌恶与蔑视的一瞥。我也细听着，因为碰巧坐在最靠房子头上的地方，所以他说的话，一大半都听得见。谈话的内容消除了我眼前的忧虑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Madam, allow me an instant. You are aware that my plan in bringing up these girls is, not to accustom them to habits of luxury and indulgence, but to render them hardy, patient, self-denying. Should any little accidental disappointment of the appetite occur, such as the spoiling of a meal, the under or the over dressing of a dish, the incident ought not to be neutralised by replacing with something more delicate the comfort lost, thus pampering the body and obviating the aim of this institution; it ought to be improved to the spiritual edification of the pupils, by encouraging them to evince fortitude under temporary privation. A brief address on those occasions would not be mistimed, wherein a judicious instructor would take the opportunity of referring to the sufferings of the primitive Christians; to the torments of martyrs; to the exhortations of our blessed Lord Himself, calling upon His disciples to take up their cross and follow Him; to His warnings that man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God; to His divine consolations, "If ye suffer hunger or thirst for My sake, happy are ye." Oh, madam, when you put bread and cheese, instead of burnt porridge, into these children's mouths, you may indeed feed their vile bodies, but you little think how you starve their immortal souls!"</div>

The two younger of the trio (fine girls of sixteen and seventeen) had grey beaver hats, then in fashion, shaded with ostrich plumes, and from under the brim of this graceful head-dress fell a profusion of light tresses, elaborately curled; the elder lady was enveloped in a costly velvet shawl, trimmed with ermine, and she wore a false front of French curls.</div>

<div class="line_en">Hitherto, while gathering up the discourse of Mr. Brocklehurst and Miss Temple, I had not, at the same time, neglected precautions to secure my personal safety; which I thought would be effected, if I could only elude observation. To this end, I had sat well back on the form, and while seeming to be busy with my sum, had held my slate in such a manner as to conceal my face: I might have escaped notice, had not my treacherous slate somehow happened to slip from my hand, and falling with an obtrusive crash, directly drawn every eye upon me; I knew it was all over now, and, as I stooped to pick up the two fragments of slate, I rallied my forces for the worst. It came.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到现在为止，我一面领会着布罗克赫斯特先生和坦普尔小姐的讲话，一面并没有放松戒备，确保自己的安全，而只要不被看到，安全是没有问题的。为了达到这个目的，我坐在长凳上，身子往后靠，看上去似乎在忙于计算，把写字板端得刚好遮住了脸。我本可以逃避别人的注意，却不料我那块捣蛋的写字板，不知怎地恰巧从我手里滑落，砰地一声冒然落地。顷刻之间人人都朝我投来了目光。我知道这下全完了，我弯下腰捡起了碎为两半的写字板，鼓足勇气准备面对最坏的结局，它终于来了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">These ladies were deferentially received by Miss Temple, as Mrs. and the Misses Brocklehurst, and conducted to seats of honour at the top of the room. It seems they had come in the carriage with their reverend relative, and had been conducting a rummaging scrutiny of the room upstairs, while he transacted business with the housekeeper, questioned the laundress, and lectured the superintendent. They now proceeded to address divers remarks and reproofs to Miss Smith, who was charged with the care of the linen and the inspection of the dormitories: but I had no time to listen to what they said; other matters called off and enchanted my attention.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这几位太太小姐，一位是布罗克赫斯特太太，还有两位是布罗克赫斯特小姐。她们受到了坦普尔小姐恭敬的接待，被领到了房间一头的上座。她们看来是与担任圣职的亲属乘同一辆马车到达的，在他与管家办理公务，饲问洗衣女，教训校长时，她们已经在楼上的房间仔细看过究竟。这时她们对负责照管衣被、检查寝室的史密斯小姐，提出了种种看法和责难。不过我没有工夫去听她们说些什么，其他事情来打岔，并吸引了我的注意力。">查看中文翻译</div>

You must be on your guard against her; you must shun her example; if necessary, avoid her company, exclude her from your sports, and shut her out from your converse. Teachers, you must watch her: keep your eyes on her movements, weigh well her words, scrutinise her actions, punish her body to save her soul: if, indeed, such salvation be possible, for (my tongue falters while I tell it) this girl, this child, the native of a Christian land, worse than many a little heathen who says its prayers to Brahma and kneels before Juggernaut -- this girl is -- a liar!"</div>

<div class="line_en">There was I, then, mounted aloft; I, who had said I could not bear the shame of standing on my natural feet in the middle of the room, was now exposed to general view on a pedestal of infamy. What my sensations were no language can describe; but just as they all rose, stifling my breath and constricting my throat, a girl came up and passed me: in passing, she lifted her eyes. What a strange light inspired them! What an extraordinary sensation that ray sent through me! How the new feeling bore me up! It was as if a martyr, a hero, had passed a slave or victim, and imparted strength in the transit. I mastered the rising hysteria, lifted up my head, and took a firm stand on the stool. Helen Burns asked some slight question about her work of Miss Smith, was chidden for the triviality of the inquiry, returned to her place, and smiled at me as she again went by. What a smile! I remember it now, and I know that it was the effluence of fine intellect, of true courage; it lit up her marked lineaments, her thin face, her sunken grey eye, like a reflection from the aspect of an angel. Yet at that moment Helen Burns wore on her arm "the untidy badge;" scarcely an hour ago I had heard her condemned by Miss Scatcherd to a dinner of bread and water on the morrow because she had blotted an exercise in copying it out. Such is the imperfect nature of man! such spots are there on the disc of the clearest planet; and eyes like Miss Scatcherd's can only see those minute defects, and are blind to the full brightness of the orb.</div>
