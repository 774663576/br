<div class="line_en">Tyrion dressed himself in darkness, listening to his wife's soft breathing from the bed they shared. She dreams, he thought, when Sansa murmured something softly -- a name, perhaps, though it was too faint to say -- and turned onto her side. As man and wife they shared a marriage bed, but that was all. Even her tears she hoards to herself.</div>

<div class="line_en">He had expected anguish and anger when he told her of her brother's death, but Sansa's face had remained so still that for a moment he feared she had not understood. it was only later, with a heavy oaken door between them, that he heard her sobbing. Tyrion had considered going to her then, to offer what comfort he could. No, he had to remind himself, she will not look for solace from a Lannister. The most he could do was to shield her from the uglier details of the Red Wedding as they came down from the Twins. Sansa did not need to hear how her brother's body had been hacked and mutilated, he decided; nor how her mother's corpse had been dumped naked into the Green Fork in a savage mockery of House Tully's funeral customs. The last thing the girl needed was more fodder for her nightmares.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他亲口把她哥哥的死讯告诉她时，以为她会痛苦或者愤怒，但都没有，珊莎的表情一如既往地平静，不禁让他以为对方根本没听懂。只是事后，在沉重的橡木门隔开夫妻之后，方才传来她的啜泣。提利昂好想冲进去，给她安慰。不，他提醒自己，此时此刻她最不想见的就是兰尼斯特家的人。他所能做的，只是隐瞒红色婚礼的肮脏细节，不要让珊莎知道哥哥被砍头和侮辱，不要让她知道母亲的尸体被赤裸着扔进绿叉河，以野蛮地讽刺徒利家族的丧葬风俗。孩子，你的噩梦业已够多。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He pulled on his boots, fastened his cloak with a lion's head brooch, and slipped out into the torchlit hall. There was this much to be said for his marriage; it had allowed him to escape Maegor's Holdfast. Now that he had a wife and household, his lord father had agreed that more suitable accommodations were required, and Lord Gyles had found himself abruptly dispossessed of his spacious apartments atop the Kitchen Keep. And splendid apartments they were too, with a large bedchamber and adequate solar, a bath and dressing room for his wife, and small adjoining chambers for Pod and Sansa's maids. Even Bronn's cell by the stair had a window of sorts. Well, more an arrow slit, but it lets in light. The castle's main kitchen was just across the courtyard, true, but Tyrion found those sounds and smells infinitely preferable to sharing Maegor's with his sister. The less he had to see of Cersei the happier he was like to be.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他穿好靴子，用狮头胸针系好斗篷，走出烛光摇曳的长廊。得以避开梅葛楼是婚姻为他带来的唯一好处。由于有了妻室仆从，父亲大人决定为他找个好居所，便把盖尔斯伯爵粗暴地赶出了厨堡顶层。这层楼的确宽敞，不仅有间大卧室和相搭配的书房，还有妻子专用的洗澡间和更衣室，以及供波德和珊莎的侍女们居住的小房间，就连波隆也住进楼梯旁有窗户的客房——嗯，那其实是箭孔，但好歹能透过光亮。城堡的大厨房就在院子对面，但提利昂觉得忍受一点气味和噪音远胜过和姐姐同住梅葛楼。离瑟曦越远，他就越开心。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was not enough, though. He had wrapped his cloak around her shoulders and sworn to protect her, but that was as cruel a jape as the crown the Freys had placed atop the head of Robb Stark's direwolf after they'd sewn it onto his headless corpse. Sansa knew that as well. The way she looked at him, her stiffness when she climbed into their bed… when he was with her, never for an instant could he forget who he was, or what he was. No more than she did. She still went nightly to the godswood to pray, and Tyrion wondered if she were praying for his death. She had lost her home, her place in the world, and everyone she had ever loved or trusted. Winter is coming, warned the Stark words, and truly it had come for them with a vengeance. But it is high summer for House Lannister. So why am I so bloody cold?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不，他知道自己做的不够，可又能怎么办呢？他将斗篷包裹在她肩膀，发誓一辈子的守护，而这，和佛雷家族将狼头缝在罗柏·史塔克的尸体上，并为之戴起王冠一样，都只是个残酷的笑话。珊莎对此一清二楚。她看他的眼神，她在床上僵硬的身躯…夫妻团聚时，他一刻也不敢忘记自己是谁，不敢忘记自己的长相。她也没忘。妻子依旧夜夜去神木林祈祷，提利昂不知她是否祷告他的死亡。她失去了家园，失去了依靠，在这个世上，每一位所爱过或信任过的人，统统进了坟墓。凛冬将至，史塔克家族自食其言。对兰尼斯特家族，如今真是炎炎盛夏，为何我却凄凉无比呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tyrion could hear Brella's snoring as he passed her cell. Shae complained of that, but it seemed a small enough price to pay. Varys had suggested the woman to him; in former days, she had run Lord Renly's household in the city, which had given her a deal of practice at being blind, deaf, and mute.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="经过房间时，他听见贝蕾娜的鼾声——雪伊经常为此抱怨，然而付出这点代价总还值得。此女由瓦里斯推荐，从前是蓝礼大人在君临的管家，颇经世事，深谙装聋作哑之道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Lighting a taper, he made his way back to the servants' steps and descended. The floors below his own were still, and he heard no footsteps but his own. Down he went, to the ground floor and beyond, to emerge in a gloomy cellar with a vaulted stone ceiling. Much of the castle was connected underground, and the Kitchen Keep was no exception. Tyrion waddled along a long dark passageway until he found the door he wanted, and pushed through.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="提利昂燃起一只蜡烛，走下仆人们用的楼梯。地板很坚实，只听见自己的脚步。他不断往下，下到地面，走入地底，来到一个有石拱顶的昏暗地窖。盘根错节的通道联系着红堡各处，厨堡自不例外。提利昂踱过一条长长的黑暗走道，推开尽头的门。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Within, the dragon skulls were waiting, and so was Shae. "I thought m'lord had forgotten me." Her dress was draped over a black tooth near as tall as she was, and she stood within the dragon's jaws, nude. Balerion, he thought. Or was it Vhagar? One dragon skull looked much like another. just the sight of her made him hard. "Come out of there."</div>

<div class="line_en">He did, finally, but only because she let herself be caught. By the time she slipped into his arms, he was flushed and out of breath from stumbling into dragon skulls. All that was forgotten in an instant when he felt her small breasts pressed against his face in the dark, her stiff little nipples brushing lightly over his lips and the scar where his nose had been. Tyrion pulled her down onto the floor. "My giant," she breathed as he entered her. "My giant's come to save me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他抓了很久，最后才勉强成功，因此怀疑根本是她故意失手的。当她钻进他怀中，他已气喘吁吁、面红耳赤，不由自主地绊上龙骨。但她在黑暗中将小乳房贴紧他的脸颊，坚硬的小乳头轻扫过他的嘴唇和鼻子上的伤疤，所有的疲惫和犹豫顿时一扫而空。提利昂将雪伊压在地板上。“我的巨人，”他边插她，她边呢喃，“我的巨人来救我了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Spider was right. Tyrion groped through the dragon-haunted darkness for his smallclothes, feeling wretched. The risk he was taking left him tight as a drumhead, and there was guilt as well. The Others can take my guilt, he thought as he slipped his tunic over his head. Why should I be guilty? My wife wants no part of me, and most especially not the part that seems to want her. Perhaps he ought to tell her about Shae. It was not as though he was the first man ever to keep a concubine. Sansa's own oh-so-honorable father had given her a bastard brother. For all he knew, his wife might be thrilled to learn that he was fucking Shae, so long as it spared her his unwelcome touch.</div>

<div class="line_en">Or, if she was tired of earning her bread on her back, he might arrange a marriage for her. Bronn, perhaps?

Tyrion had noticed that one gazing wistfully at Shae more than once. Why not? He's tall, strong, not hard to look upon, every inch the gifted young knight.

<div class="line_en">"No," he said, too curtly. "You always please me." And therein is our danger. He might dream of sending her away at times like this, but that never lasted long. Tyrion saw her dimly through the gloom, pulling a woolen sock up a slender leg. I can see. A vague light was leaking through the row of long narrow windows set high in the cellar wall. The skulls of the Targaryen dragons were emerging from the darkness around them, black amidst grey. "Day comes too soon." A new day. A new year. A new century.
