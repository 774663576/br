<div class="line_en">The clearing up certainly needed a lot of work, but it took less time than Sam had feared. The day after the battle Frodo rode to Michel Delving and released the prisoners from the Lockholes. One of the first that they found was poor Fredegar Bolger, Fatty no longer. He had been taken when the ruffians smoked out a band of rebels that he led from their hidings up in the Brockenbores by the hills of Scary.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then there was Lobelia. Poor thing, she looked very old and thin when they rescued her from a dark and narrow cell. She insisted on hobbling out on her own feet; and she had such a welcome, and there was such clapping and cheering when she appeared, leaning on Frodo's arm but still clutching her umbrella, that she was quite touched, and drove away in tears. She had never in her life been popular before. But she was crushed by the news of Lotho's murder, and she would not return to Bag End. She gave it back to Frodo, and went to her own people, the Bracegirdles of Hardbottle.</div>

<div class="line_en">When the poor creature died next spring -- she was after all more than a hundred years old -- Frodo was surprised and much moved: she had left all that remained of her money and of Lotho's for him to use in helping hobbits made homeless by the troubles.

<div class="line_en">Old Will Whitfoot had been in the Lockholes longer than any, and though he had perhaps been treated less harshly than some, he needed a lot of feeding up before he could look the part of Mayor; so Frodo agreed to act as his Deputy, until Mr. Whitfoot was in shape again. The only thing that he did as Deputy Mayor was to reduce the Shirriffs to their proper functions and numbers. The task of hunting out the last remnant of the ruffians was left to Merry and Pippin, and it was soon done. The southern gangs, after hearing the news of the Battle of Bywater, fled out of the land and offered little resistance to the Thain. Before the Year's End the few survivors were rounded up in the woods, and those that surrendered were shown to the borders.</div>

<div class="line_en">One of the first things done in Hobbiton, before even the removal of the new mill, was the clearing of the Hill and Bag End, and the restoration of Bagshot Row. The front of the new sand-pit was all levelled and made into a large sheltered garden, and new holes were dug in the southward face, back into the Hill, and they were lined with brick. The Gaffer was restored to Number Three; and he said often and did not care who heard it:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在拆除新磨坊之前，众人在哈比屯所做的第一件事情，就是清理小山和袋底洞，将袋边路恢复旧观。那些沙堆都被铲平，改成了一个大的花园，山丘的南边也挖了许多洞穴，旁边则是用砖块支撑。老爹重新搬回了三号房，他经常在人前人后自言自语说：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Meanwhile the labour of repair went on apace, and Sam was kept very busy. Hobbits can work like bees when the mood and the need comes on them. Now there were thousands of willing hands of all ages, from the small but nimble ones of the hobbit lads and lasses to the well-worn and horny ones of the gaffers and gammers. Before Yule not a brick was left standing of the new Shirriff-houses or of anything that had been built by "Sharkey's Men"; but the bricks were used to repair many an old hole, to make it snugger and drier. Great stores of goods and food, and beer, were found that had been hidden away by the ruffians in sheds and barns and deserted holes, and especially in the tunnels at Michel Delving and in the old quarries at Scary; so that there was a great deal better cheer that Yule than anyone had hoped for.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在此同时，修复旧观的工作也在加紧脚步进行，山姆也非常地忙碌。在有需要、心情不错的时候，哈比人可以像是蜜蜂一般的整日工作；现在，到处都有成千上百的自愿者愿意贡献一己的力量，从小朋友到满手老茧的老爹大妈都有。到冬季庆典之前，那些萨基的手下所兴建的砖造房屋就全被拆掉了，那些砖块则是被用来修补地洞，让它们变得更温暖、更干燥一些。那些强盗所藏起来的啤酒、食物都被从谷仓、地洞和屋子里面找了出来，这些东西在米丘窟和史卡力的旧谷仓里面还特别多，因此，这年的冬季庆典其实大家过得还算不错。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was some discussion of the name that the new row should be given. Battle Gardens was thought of, or BetterSmials. But after a while in sensible hobbit-fashion it was just called New Row. It was a purely Bywater joke to refer to it as Sharkey's End.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随后，大伙还热烈的讨论了一下，这一排新房子应该叫什么名字。有人提议战斗花园，或是好地道。不过，在讨论一阵之后，大伙还是同意用哈比人的惯例，将这边命名为新边路。只有临水路的人会开玩笑叫这边为萨基挂点路。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So Sam planted saplings in all the places where specially beautiful or beloved trees had been destroyed, and he put a grain of the precious dust in the soil at the root of each. He went up and down the Shire in this labour; but if he paid special attention to Hobbiton and Bywater no one blamed him. And at the end he found that he still had a little of the dust left; so he went to the Three-Farthing Stone, which is as near the centre of the Shire as no matter, and cast it in the air with his blessing. The little silver nut he planted in the Party Field where the tree had once been; and he wondered what would come of it. All through the winter he remained as patient as he could, and tried to restrain himself from going round constantly to see if anything was happening.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因此，山姆在许多特别美丽、或是为人怀念的大树被砍倒之处又种下了树苗，然后他将这珍贵的粉尘在每株树苗根部洒上一些。他在夏尔东奔西跑的忙碌，不过，即使他特别偏袒哈比屯和临水路一带，也没人忍心责怪他。最后，他发现还剩下一些粉尘，因此，他来到了分界石的地方，这里应该最接近夏尔的中心了，他将粉尘抛向空中，带着他的祝福四散飞扬。那小小的银色种子则是种在原先生长着高大、美丽的宴会树的地方。他也不知道最后它会长成什么样子，一整个冬天，他都尽可能的耐心等候，强逼自己不要到处乱跑，打探是否有任何变化。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Spring surpassed his wildest hopes. His trees began to sprout and grow, as if time was in a hurry and wished to make one year do for twenty. In the Party Field a beautiful young sapling leaped up: it had silver bark and long leaves and burst into golden flowers in April. It was indeed a mallorn, and it was the wonder of the neighbourhood. In after years, as it grew in grace and beauty, it was known far and wide and people would come long journeys to see it: the only mallorn west of the Mountains and east of the Sea, and one of the finest in the world.</div>

<div class="line_en">Altogether 1420 in the Shire was a marvellous year. Not only was there wonderful sunshine and delicious rain, in due times and perfect measure, but there seemed something more: an air of richness and growth, and a gleam of a beauty beyond that of mortal summers that flicker and pass upon this Middle-earth. All the children born or begotten in that year, and there were many, were fair to see and strong, and most of them had a rich golden hair that had before been rare among hobbits. The fruit was so plentiful that young hobbits very nearly bathed in strawberries and cream; and later they sat on the lawns under the plum-trees and ate, until they had made piles of stones like small pyramids or the heaped skulls of a conqueror, and then they moved on. And no one was ill, and everyone was pleased, except those who had to mow the grass.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the Southfarthing the vines were laden, and the yield of "leaf" was astonishing; and everywhere there was so much corn that at Harvest every barn was stuffed. The Northfarthing barley was so fine that the beer of 1420 malt was long remembered and became a byword. Indeed a generation later one might hear an old gaffer in an inn, after a good pint of well-earned ale, put down his mug with a sigh: "Ah! that was proper fourteen-twenty, that was!"</div>

The two young Travellers cut a great dash in the Shire with their songs and their tales and their finery, and their wonderful parties. "Lordly" folk called them, meaning nothing but good; for it warmed all hearts to see them go riding by with their mail-shirts so bright and their shields so splendid, laughing and singing songs of far away; and if they were now large and magnificent, they were unchanged otherwise, unless they were indeed more fairspoken and more jovial and full of merriment than ever before.</div>

Also in the autumn there appeared a shadow of old troubles.</div>

<div class="line_en">Time went on, and 1421 came in. Frodo was ill again in March, but with a great effort he concealed it, for Sam had other things to think about. The first of Sam and Rosie's children was born on the twenty-fifth of March, a date that Sam noted.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I suppose you're right, Mr. Frodo," said Sam. "I've heard some beautiful names on my travels, but I suppose they're a bit too grand for daily wear and tear, as you might say. The Gaffer, he says: 'Make it short, and then you won't have to cut it short before you can use it.'

<div class="line_en">Then Frodo kissed Merry and Pippin, and last of all Sam, and went aboard; and the sails were drawn up, and the wind blew, and slowly the ship slipped away down the long grey firth; and the light of the glass of Galadriel that Frodo bore glimmered and was lost. And the ship went out into the High Sea and passed on into the West, until at last on a night of rain Frodo smelled a sweet fragrance on the air and heard the sound of singing that came over the water. And then it seemed to him that as in his dream in the house of Bombadil, the grey rain-curtain turned all to silver glass and was rolled back, and he beheld white shores and beyond them a far green country under a swift sunrise.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佛罗多亲吻了梅里和皮聘，最后则是山姆，接着他也上了船。船帆扬起，海风吹拂，船缓缓地离开港口，佛罗多所戴着的宝石发出闪光，就消失在迷雾中。这艘船航向大海，直往西方前进…直到一个下雨的夜晚，佛罗多闻到了空气中甜美的味道，以及海上传来的歌声。然后，就如同他在庞巴迪尔的家中所做的梦一样，灰色的雨幕被拉开，眼前出现了一个洁白的海岸，一望无际的绿色大地和美丽的日出。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You tried to give us the slip once before and failed, Frodo," he said. "This time you have nearly succeeded, but you have failed again. It was not Sam, though, that gave you away this time, but Gandalf himself!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“佛罗多，你之前想要偷溜，可是失败了，”他说：“这次你差点就成功了，但我们又逮到了你。不过，这次可不是山姆出卖你，而是甘道夫啦！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But Sam was now sorrowful at heart, and it seemed to him that if the parting would be bitter, more grievous still would be the long road home alone. But even as they stood there, and the Elves were going aboard, and all was being made ready to depart, up rode Merry and Pippin in great haste. And amid his tears Pippin laughed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但山姆现在真的觉得很伤心了，因为，他开始想到，如果这道别让他难过，孤单回家的旅程将会更难忍受。正当他站在那边，精灵们依序上船，准备出发时，梅里和皮聘匆忙赶到，皮聘泪眼婆娑的笑了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At last the three companions turned away, and never again looking back they rode slowly homewards; and they spoke no word to one another until they came back to the Shire, but each had great comfort in his friends on the long grey road.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，三人转身离开，头也不回的缓缓踏上归乡之路。在他们接近夏尔之前，他们都沉默不语，但都很感谢朋友能够待在身边。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But to Sam the evening deepened to darkness as he stood at the Haven; and as he looked at the grey sea he saw only a shadow on the waters that was soon lost in the West. There still he stood far into the night, hearing only the sigh and murmur of the waves on the shores of Middle-earth, and the sound of them sank deep into his heart. Beside him stood Merry and Pippin, and they were silent.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对山姆来说，当他站在港口上的那个傍晚，他觉得相当难过。他只能看见灰色的海面上有一个影子消失在西方，他站在那边望着，直到深夜，只能聆听着中土世界海浪拍打的声音，这声音深深地烙印在他心中。梅里和皮聘站在他身边，一言不发的望着海面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He drew a deep breath. "Well, I'm back," he said.</div>

<div class="line_en">At last they rode over the downs and took the East Road, and then Merry and Pippin rode on to Buckland; and already they were singing again as they went. But Sam turned to Bywater, and so came back up the Hill, as day was ending once more. And he went on, and there was yellow light, and fire within; and the evening meal was ready, and he was expected. And Rose drew him in, and set him in his chair, and put little Elanor upon his lap.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，他们越过小丘，踏上东路，梅里和皮聘前往雄鹿地，这时他们已经开始唱起歌来。山姆则是转往临水区，最后来到了小山旁，这时又正是傍晚。当他往前走的时候，他可以看见屋内有着黄光和温暖的火焰，晚餐已经准备好了，大家在等他回来。小玫拉他进去，让他坐好位子，把伊拉诺放到他腿上。">查看中文翻译</div>
