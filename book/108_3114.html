<div class="line_en">Sonja used to say that Ove was "unforgiving." For instance, he refused to go back to the local bakery eight years after they gave him the wrong change when he bought pastries once at the end of the 1990s. Ove called it "having firm principles." They were never quite in agreement when it came to words and their meanings.</div>

<div class="line_en">Of course, it had started innocently enough, not long after Ove and Sonja came back from Spain and the accident. Ove laid new paving stones in their little garden that summer, whereupon Rune put up a new fence around his. Whereupon Ove put up an even higher fence around his garden, whereupon Rune went off to the building supply store and a few days later started boasting all over the street that he had "built a swimming pool." That was no bloody swimming pool, Ove raged to Sonja. It was a little splash pool for Rune and Anita's newborn urchin, that was all it was. For a while Ove had plans to report it to the Planning Department as an illegal construction, but at that point Sonja put her foot down and sent him out to "mow the lawn" and calm himself down. And so Ove did just that, although it certainly did not calm him down very much at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="起初总是很无辜，那时欧维和索雅刚从西班牙回来，也就是那场车祸后不久。那年夏天，欧维为家门口的庭院铺了新的地砖，而鲁尼在自己的庭院周围竖起了栅栏。于是，欧维当然竖了一圈更高的栅栏，然后鲁尼去了趟施工用品店，几天后，他在小区里逢人就说自己“造了个游泳池”。才他妈不是什么游泳池，欧维对索雅抱怨。就是给鲁尼和安妮塔刚刚诞生的小家伙挖了个小池塘，仅此而已。有段时间，欧维盘算着要去建筑管理部门举报，说那是违章搭建，这下索雅说他过分了，把他支出去修理草坪并“冷静冷静”。虽然这完全不能让他冷静下来，欧维还是照办了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The lawn was oblong, about five yards wide, and ran along the backs of Ove's and Rune's houses and the house in between, which Sonja and Anita had quickly named "the neutral zone." No one quite knew what that lawn was for or what function it was expected to fill, but when row housing was put up in those days, some city architect must have got the idea that there had to be lawns here and there, for no other reason than that they looked so very nice in the drawings. When Ove and Rune formed the Residents' Association and were still friends, the two men decided that Ove should be the "grounds man" and responsible for keeping the grass mowed. It had always been Ove before. On one occasion the other neighbors had proposed that the association should put out tables and benches on the lawn to create a sort of "common space for all the neighbors," but obviously Ove and Rune put a stop to that at once. It would only turn into a bloody mess and lots of noise.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="草坪又窄又长，大约五米宽，躺在欧维和鲁尼的房子之间以及背后。很快索雅和安妮塔就把这些区域命名为“中立地区”。没人知道这片草坪为什么长在这儿，或要满足什么功能，但当时排屋小区兴建的时候，那几个民用建筑师认为那儿就应该有些，也没别的什么原因，就是画到图纸上好看。欧维和鲁尼成立社区公共管理委员会并且没闹翻的时候，他们俩同时决定欧维应该当“草坪主管”，负责修剪事宜。之后许多年，这事儿都归欧维管。有那么一回，其他邻居建议委员会应该在草坪上设置桌椅，使其成为“所有邻居的公共户外场所”，但欧维和鲁尼当然就给否决了。不然这儿肯定立马变成马戏场，专门生产噪音。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Soon after Rune had built his "pool," a rat ran across Ove's newly mown lawn and into the trees on the other side. Ove immediately called a "crisis meeting" of the association and demanded that all local residents put out rat poison around their houses. The neighbors protested, of course, because they had seen hedgehogs by the edge of the woods and were concerned that they might eat the poison. Rune also protested, because he was afraid that some of it would end up in his pool. Ove suggested to Rune that he button up his shirt and go see a psychologist about his delusions of living on the French Riviera. Rune made a malicious joke at Ove's expense, to the effect that Ove had probably only imagined seeing that rat. All the others laughed. Ove never forgave Rune for that. The next morning someone had thrown birdseed all over Rune's outside space, and Rune had to use a spade to chase away a dozen rats as big as vacuum cleaners in the next few weeks. After that Ove got permission to put out poison, even though Rune mumbled that he'd pay him back for this.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="鲁尼造完他的“游泳池”后不久，一只老鼠飞奔着经过欧维家的院子，窜过刚修剪好的草坪，消失在对面的树林里。欧维立即在社区委员会里召开了“紧急会议”，要求每户居民都在自家门口摆放老鼠药。其他邻居当然反对，因为他们常看见树林里有刺猬出没，他们担心刺猬也会误食老鼠药。鲁尼也反对，因为他担心老鼠会带着药跑到他的池子里去。欧维建议鲁尼系上衬衣扣子，找个心理医生帮他消除住在“蔚蓝海岸”的幻觉。于是鲁尼拿欧维开了个蹩脚的玩笑，说他看到的老鼠才是幻觉。其他人都笑了。为此欧维永远不会原谅鲁尼。第二天早晨，有人把鸟食在鲁尼的院子里撒了个遍，接着两个星期，鲁尼用铲子赶走了一打吸尘器大小的老鼠。之后欧维自然获准摆上了老鼠药，但鲁尼嘴里一直念叨着要找他算账。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">However, Ove got his revenge during the Snow Clearance Skirmish of the following winter, in which Rune wanted to anoint himself "Chief of Snow Shoveling" and at the same time lumber the Residents' Association with the purchase of a gigantic snowblower. Ove had no intention of letting Rune walk around with some bloody contraption at the expense of the association and spray snow over Ove's windows, which he made crystal clear at the steering group meeting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二年冬天，欧维在铲雪冲突中扳回一局，当时鲁尼想自封“铲雪组长”，同时迫使委员会购买一台巨型铲雪机。欧维当然不会容忍鲁尼开个由委员会买单的混账机器，往欧维家窗户上喷雪片子，这一点，他已在委员会上说得明明白白。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Two years later Rune won the Great Tree Conflict, when he gained permission at the annual meeting to saw down a tree blocking his and Anita's evening sun on one side. The same tree on the other side screened off Ove and Sonja's bedroom from blinding morning sunlight. Further, he managed to block Ove's furious motion that the association would then have to pay for Ove's new awning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两年后，鲁尼在那场重大的砍树纠纷中取得了胜利，他在年度会议上获准砍掉那棵挡住他和安妮塔卧室夕阳的树。同一棵树在另一侧帮助欧维和索雅挡掉了刺眼的朝阳。另外，他还成功驳回了愤怒的欧维对社区委员会提出的为他支付遮阳篷费用的要求。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Rune was still chosen to be responsible for snow clearance, but to his great annoyance he had to spend all winter shoveling the snow by hand between the houses. The outcome of this, of course, was that he consistently shoveled outside all the houses in their row except Ove and Sonja's. Just to annoy Rune, in mid-January Ove hired a gigantic snowblower to clear the ten square yards outside his door. Rune was incandescent about it, Ove remembers with delight to this day.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="鲁尼仍然当选铲雪组长，但让他懊恼的是，整个冬天，他不得不徒步、徒手铲房子之间的雪。结果当然是他铲遍了整个小区，除了欧维和索雅家门口，但欧维满不在乎。就为了跟鲁尼赌气，一月中旬，欧维跑去找来了一台大铲雪机，铲掉了家门口十平方米之内的积雪。鲁尼当然因此大光其火，欧维至今怀着愉悦的心情牢记在心。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When the next winter set in, the steering group decided that the area needed a new collective heating system. Quite coincidentally, of course, Rune and Ove happened to have diametrically different views on what sort of heating system was required, which was jokingly referred to by the other neighbors as "the battle of the water pump." It grew into an eternal struggle between the two men.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后一年冬天，管理委员会决定，整个小区需要统一更换新的集中供暖系统。纯属偶然，鲁尼和欧维在需要更换何种暖气的看法上截然不同，这场被其他邻居戏称为“水泵事件”的斗争，在两个男人之间愈演愈烈。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Of course, Rune found a way of paying him back the following summer, by buying one of those monstrous lawn tractors. Then, by a combination of treachery, lies, and conspiracies, he managed to get approval at the annual meeting to take over Ove's lawn-mowing responsibilities on the grounds that he had "slightly more adequate equipment than the one who was in charge of it before."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="之后那个夏天，鲁尼当然又想方设法报了仇，他买了一台那种骇人听闻的魔鬼割草机。然后他通过一系列谎言和阴谋在年会上夺取了欧维割草的权力。如今他“比前负责人多了一些专业的工具”，鲁尼边说边冲欧维的方向狞笑。欧维当然无法证明鲁尼在年会上成功上位是靠谎言和阴谋，但他坚信事实就是如此。“该死的聒噪机”，每次鲁尼神气活现地像个牛仔似的骑着座驾经过窗前，欧维都这么问候那台割草机。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As a partial restitution, Ove managed some four years later to stop Rune's plans of putting in new windows in his house, because after thirty-three letters and a dozen angry telephone calls the Planning Department gave up and accepted Ove's argument that this would "ruin the harmonious architectural character of the area."</div>

<div class="line_en">But, as Sonja used to say, there were also some other moments. There weren't many of them, but women like Sonja and Anita knew how to make the most of them. Because there hadn't always been burning conflict. One summer in the 1980s, for instance, Ove had bought a Saab 9000 and Rune a Volvo 760. And they were so pleased with this that they kept the peace for several weeks. Sonja and Anita even managed to get all four of them together for dinner on a few occasions. Rune and Anita's son, who'd had time to turn into a teenager by this stage, with all the divinely sanctioned charmlessness and impoliteness this entailed, sat at one end of the table like an irritable accessory. "That boy was born angry," Sonja used to say with sadness in her voice, but Ove and Rune managed to get along so well that they even had a little whiskey together at the end of the evening.</div>

Within fifteen minutes the argument had escalated so much in volume that Sonja and Anita agreed it might be best to eat their dinner separately after all. The two men had time to buy and sell a Volvo 760 (Turbo) and a Saab 9000i before they spoke to one another again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那年夏天最后一顿晚餐，很不幸，欧维和鲁尼都决定要烧烤。当然他们很快就围绕“何种步骤点燃欧维的烧烤架更高效”这个问题争执了起来。十五分钟以后，由于争吵的音量过高，索雅和安妮塔都不得不同意还是各自回家吃饭更好。两个男人直到各自卖掉旧车，一个买了一辆新沃尔沃760（涡轮驱动），另一个买了辆萨博9000之后，才又说上话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Rune and Anita's son moved away from home when he was twenty, in the early 1990s. Apparently he went to America, Ove found out from Sonja. They hardly saw him again. From time to time Anita had a telephone call around the time of Christmas, but "he was so busy with his own things now," as Anita said when she tried to keep her spirits up, even though Sonja could see that she had to hold back her tears.

In the end there had been so many new faces in the doorways of the other row houses that they all merged in a sea of gray. Where before there had been forest, there were only construction cranes. Ove and Rune stood outside their houses, hands obstinately shoved into their trouser pockets, like ancient relics in a new age, while a parade of uppity real estate agents barely able to see over their grapefruit-size tie knots patrolled the little road between the houses and kept their eyes on them -- like vultures watching aging water buffaloes.

<div class="line_en">A few years later Rune and Ove fell out for the hundredth time about that collective heating system. Ove stormed out of a Residents' Association meeting, in a fury, and never returned. The last battle the two men fought was a bit into the noughties when Rune bought one of those automated robotic lawn mowers, which he'd ordered from Asia, and left it to whiz about on the lawn behind the houses. Rune could even remotely program it to cut "special patterns," Sonja said in an impressed tone of voice one evening when she came home from visiting Anita. Ove soon caught on that this "special pattern" was the habit of that robotic little shit to consistently rumble back and forth all night outside Ove and Sonja's bedroom window. One evening Sonja saw Ove fetch a screwdriver and walk out the veranda door. Next morning the little robot, quite inexplicably, had driven right into Rune's pool.</div>

Because now it was only him and Anita, as he told Sonja when they met in the parking area. "And one can't drive a Volvo all of one's life," he said with an attempt at a halfhearted smile. She could hear that he was trying to swallow his tears. And that was the moment when Ove realized that a part of Rune had given up forever. And for that maybe neither Ove nor Rune forgave him.</div>
