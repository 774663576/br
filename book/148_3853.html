<div class="line_en">The purpose of a chronicler of moods and deeds does not require him to express his personal views upon the grave controversy above given. That the twain were happy -- between their times of sadness -- was indubitable. And when the unexpected apparition of Jude's child in the house had shown itself to be no such disturbing event as it had looked, but one that brought into their lives a new and tender interest of an ennobling and unselfish kind, it rather helped than injured their happiness.</div>

<div class="line_en">To be sure, with such pleasing anxious beings as they were, the boy's coming also brought with it much thought for the future, particularly as he seemed at present to be singularly deficient in all the usual hopes of childhood. But the pair tried to dismiss, for a while at least, a too strenuously forward view.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说来这也是很自然的，因为他们本来就是与世无争、与人无侮、总期得到别人好感的好好先生。孩子之来，特别是他很怪，缺少童年时代孩子身上常常具有的希望，不免令他们平添几分心事，但是他们竭力避免望子成器的想法，至少在短时间内不作此想。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There is in Upper Wessex an old town of nine or ten thousand souls; the town may be called Stoke-Barehills. It stands with its gaunt, unattractive, ancient church, and its new red brick suburb, amid the open, chalk-soiled cornlands, near the middle of an imaginary triangle which has for its three corners the towns of Aldbrickham and Wintoncester, and the important military station of Quartershot. The great western highway from London passes through it, near a point where the road branches into two, merely to unite again some twenty miles further westward. Out of this bifurcation and reunion there used to arise among wheeled travellers, before railway days, endless questions of choice between the respective ways. But the question is now as dead as the scot-and-lot freeholder, the road waggoner, and the mail coachman who disputed it; and probably not a single inhabitant of Stoke-Barehills is now even aware that the two roads which part in his town ever meet again; for nobody now drives up and down the great western highway dally.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="话说上维塞克斯有个老镇，人口有八九千，姑且称之为斯托裸山镇。老镇本身，其中有那座外形细长难看的古老教堂和一概用红砖砌房子的新郊区，坐落在没界断的含白垩质成分的麦田中间，恰好靠近人们想象中的三角形的中央部位，奥尔布里肯和温吞塞，加上重要的夸得哨的军队哨所，构成了三个角。以伦敦为起点的有气派的西行大路穿过老镇，在镇上一个地方分成两条，再西行约二十英里又合成一条。铁路开通前，这一分一合老闹得坐骡马大车的行旅为该走哪条支路吵个不休。不过现在这个问题已经同免税持产人、乘大车的旅客和好争论的邮车车夫都成了往事。如今的斯托裸山镇上恐怕连一个人也不会想到当年镇上两条路又合成一条这回事了；因为眼下这条有气派的大路上根本无人赶着车来来往往。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The most familiar object in Stoke-Barehills nowadays is its cemetery, standing among some picturesque mediaeval ruins beside the railway; the modern chapels, modern tombs, and modern shrubs having a look of intrusiveness amid the crumbling and ivy-covered decay of the ancient walls.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯托裸山镇的人目前熟悉不过的要数公墓，它位于铁路边上一座多少有点画意的中世纪废墟，现代风格的小礼拜堂、现代式样的坟莹和现代的硬于灌木，同爬满常春藤的东倒西歪的残垣断壁一比，显得喧宾夺主，格外刺目。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On a certain day, however, in the particular year which has now been reached by this narrative -- the month being early June -- the features of the town excite little interest, though many visitors arrive by the trains; some down-trains, in especial, nearly emptying themselves here. It is the week of the Great Wessex Agricultural Show, whose vast encampment spreads over the open outskirts of the town like the tents of an investing army. Rows of marquees, huts, booths, pavilions, arcades, porticoes -- every kind of structure short of a permanent one -- cover the green field for the space of a square half-mile, and the crowds of arrivals walk through the town in a mass, and make straight for the exhibition ground. The way thereto is lined with shows, stalls, and hawkers on foot, who make a market-place of the whole roadway to the show proper, and lead some of the improvident to lighten their pockets appreciably before they reach the gates of the exhibition they came expressly to see.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这本小说写到的那一年，正值六月初某天，老镇的外貌仍然没有丝毫引人入胜之处，却忽然有大批旅客乘火车光临此地，特别是几趟下行车，一到站人差不多下得一空。原来这时正值举办大维塞克斯农业展览周，宽大的展览棚遍布老镇空旷的郊区，一望就像一支军队在那儿安营扎寨，把市镇包围起来。一排排木棚子、小木房子、布篷子、木阁子、游廊、门廊——就差永久性建筑物——鳞次栉比，足足占了草地有半平方英里。到了站的旅客，一群群前拥后挤，穿过市镇，直接涌向展览会场。路两旁排着游艺摊、杂货摊，还有走南闯北的游动商贩，把到展览会场的通道变成了集市，招得那些手头不在乎的游客，还没进展览会的大门，就把口袋里的钱掏得差不多了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They cast their eyes around. The man was about to hire a fly as some others had done, when the woman said, "Don't be in such a hurry, Cartlett. It isn't so very far to the show-yard. Let us walk down the street into the place. Perhaps I can pick up a cheap bit of furniture or old china. It is years since I was here -- never since I lived as a girl at Aldbrickham, and used to come across for a trip sometimes with my young man."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们眼睛朝周围扫了扫。男的也像别人那样要叫辆马车，女的这时说道，“干吗这么急呀，卡特莱。到展览会也不怎么远，咱们打街上走去就行啦。也许我捎带着还能买点便宜家具或是旧磁器呢。好多年我没到这儿啦——我在奥尔布里肯那阵子还是大姑娘哪，以后没在这儿呆了，有时候跟我的小伙子来转转。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It is the popular day, the shilling day, and of the fast arriving excursion trains two from different directions enter the two contiguous railway stations at almost the same minute. One, like several which have preceded it, comes from London: the other by a cross-line from Aldbrickham; and from the London train alights a couple; a short, rather bloated man, with a globular stomach and small legs, resembling a top on two pegs, accompanied by a woman of rather fine figure and rather red face, dressed in black material, and covered with beads from bonnet to skirt, that made her glisten as if clad in chain-mail.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是个大众的节日，是个花一个先令就可以进场参观个够的节日。在先后到达的游览火车中间，有两列对向开过来，差不多同时进了挨着的车站。一列跟前边的一样，是伦敦开来的，另一列从奥尔布里肯支线过来。伦敦来的车上有一对夫妇：男的矮墩墩，大肚子，小短腿，活像两根小棍子撑着个陀螺；女的跟着他，体态倒也过得去，穿一身黑颜色料子的衣裙，从帽子到身上一色镶着珠子，亮晶晶的，亚似浑身披挂着锁子甲。">查看中文翻译</div>

Cartlett's interest in Jude whatever it might have been when Arabella was new to him, had plainly flagged since her charms and her idiosyncrasies, her supernumerary hair-coils, and her optional dimples, were becoming as a tale that is told.</div>

The configuration of the landlord showed that he, too, like his customers, was becoming affected by the liquors he retailed.</div>

<div class="line_en">Arabella so regulated her pace and her husband's as to keep just in the rear of the other three, which it was easy to do without notice in such a stream of pedestrians.

<div class="line_en">But although the smouldering maternal instinct was strong enough in her to lead her to quash her husband's conjecture, she was not disposed on second thoughts to be more candid than necessary.

<div class="line_en">All continued to move ahead. The unwitting Sue and Jude, the couple in question, had determined to make this agricultural exhibition within twenty miles of their own town the occasion of a day's excursion which should combine exercise and amusement with instruction, at small expense. Not regardful of themselves alone, they had taken care to bring Father Time, to try every means of making him kindle and laugh like other boys, though he was to some extent a hindrance to the delightfully unreserved intercourse in their pilgrimages which they so much enjoyed. But they soon ceased to consider him an observer, and went along with that tender attention to each other which the shyest can scarcely disguise, and which these, among entire strangers as they imagined, took less trouble to disguise than they might have done at home. Sue, in her new summer clothes, flexible and light as a bird, her little thumb stuck up by the stem of her white cotton sunshade, went along as if she hardly touched ground, and as if a moderately strong puff of wind would float her over the hedge into the next field. Jude, in his light grey holiday-suit, was really proud of her companionship, not more for her external attractiveness than for her sympathetic words and ways. That complete mutual understanding, in which every glance and movement was as effectual as speech for conveying intelligence between them, made them almost the two parts of a single whole.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所有的人继续往前移动，苏和裘德这时无所用心，何尝意识到成了别人盯梢的对象。他们原本决定借高他们所在市镇不足二十英里的农业展览会开幕之机，好好玩上一天，花钱不多却兼有练身体，长见识，寻开心之趣。他们也不是纯为自己想，同时考虑到把时光老爹也带着，好随时随地逗他，让他跟别的孩子一样看得有滋有味，笑个没完。虽然他们在兴高采烈的旅程中无拘无束，纵情欢笑，孩子还是不免碍手碍脚，不过没多会儿他们就不把他当个注意他们的观察者了。一路上他们含情脉脉，婉奕相依，就算是平常最害臊的情侣，也没法遮掩了。再说他们自以为周围的人，素不相识，因而就如在家一样不存什么顾虑，用不着装腔作势。苏穿着新夏装，轻盈飘逸宛如小鸟，拇指小小的，紧紧扣住她的白布阳伞把子，移步时仿佛足未履地，似乎风稍大点就能把她吹起，飘过树篱，落到前面麦田里。裘德则穿着浅灰色假日服装，有她相伴相随，确实得意非凡，这固然因为她风度优雅宜人，更兼她的谈吐，她的为人行事，无不与他如出一心。他们彼此理解到了如此完全、彻底的程度，只要一个眼光，一个动作，其作用就无异于言语，足以使他们心灵融会贯通，可以说他们是合成一个整体的两部分。">查看中文翻译</div>

She adored roses, and what Arabella had witnessed was Sue detaining Jude almost against his will while she learnt the names of this variety and that, and put her face within an inch of their blooms to smell them.</div>
