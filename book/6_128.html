<div class="line_en">"My mother was twice married," she explained, in her easy, friendly manner. "The first time to Mr Halcombe, my father, and the second time to Mr Fairlie, my half-sister's father. My father was a poor man, and Miss Fairlie's father was a rich man. I've got nothing, and she has a fortune. I'm dark and ugly, and she's fair and pretty." She said all this quite happily. "My sister and I are very fond of each other, so you must please both of us, Mr Hartright, or please neither of us."</div>

<div class="line_en">When I got up the next morning, I was greeted by bright sunlight and a view of blue sea through the window. The future suddenly seemed full of promise. I found my way down to the breakfast-room and there, looking out of a window with her back turned to me, was a young woman with a perfect figure. But when she turned and walked towards me, I saw to my surprise that her face was ugly. Hair grew on her upper lip, and her mouth was large and firm. It was almost a man's face, but the friendly smile she gave me softened it and made her look more womanly. She welcomed me in a pleasant, educated voice and introduced herself as Marian Halcombe, Miss Fairlie's half-sister.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天起床，迎接我的是灿烂的阳光和窗外湛蓝的大海。未来突然好像一片光明。我下楼来到早餐室，一位身材优美的年轻女士正背对我望着窗外。当她转身向我走来时，我吃惊地发现她长得很丑。她的上唇上长着胡须，嘴唇又大又厚。尽管脸长得像个男人，但是友好的微笑使她看上去有了一些女人味儿。她同我打招呼，声音悦耳，听起来很有教养。她告诉我她叫玛丽安·哈尔库姆，费尔利小姐同母异父的姐姐。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After breakfast Mr Fairlie's personal servant, Louis, came to tell me that Mr Fairlie would like to see me. I followed the servant upstairs and was shown into a large room full of art treasures. There, in an armchair, sat a small, pale, delicate-looking man of about fifty. Despite his fine clothes and the valuable rings on his soft white fingers, there was something very unattractive about him.</div>

<div class="line_en">"So glad to have you here, Mr Hartright," he said in a high, complaining voice. "Please sit down, but don't move the chair. In my state of nerves any movement is painful to me. May I ask if you have found everything satisfactory here at Limmeridge?"</div>

<div class="line_en">We walked out together along a path through the garden, until we came to a pretty summer-house. Inside I could see a young lady standing near a table, looking out at the view and turning the pages of a little drawing book. This was Miss Laura Fairlie.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们一起沿着花园的小路来到一个漂亮的凉亭前。我看到里面有一位小姐站在一张桌子旁，望着外面的风景，手中翻动着一本小画册。这就是劳拉·费尔利小姐。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At two o'clock I entered the dining room and found Miss Halcombe seated at the table with a rather fat lady who smiled all the time. This, I discovered, was Mrs Vesey. We started eating and before long we had finished lunch, with still no sign of Miss Fairlie. Miss Halcombe noticed my frequent glances at the door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两点钟，我来到餐厅，看到哈尔库姆小姐同一位体态丰满的女士坐在桌旁，那位女士一直面带微笑。她就是维西夫人。我们开始一起吃饭，不一会儿就吃完了，但一直没见到费尔利小姐的影子。哈尔库姆小姐注意到我不断地朝门口张望。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">How can I describe her? How can I separate this moment from all that has happened since then? In a drawing I later made of her she appears as a light, youthful figure wearing a simple white and blue striped dress and a summer hat. Her hair is light brown, almost gold, and she has eyes that are clear and blue, with a look of truth in them. They give her whole face such a charm that it is difficult to notice each individual feature: the delicate, though not perfectly straight, nose; the sweet, sensitive mouth. The life and beauty of her face lies in her eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我该怎样描述她呢？我怎样才能把此时此刻同后来发生的一切分开呢？在我后来画的一张她的肖像里，她年轻活泼，身穿式样简单的蓝白条纹连衣裙，头戴遮阳帽。她的头发是淡棕色，接近金色。她有一双清澈诚实的蓝眼睛，使她魅力四射，让你不再注意她脸上的其他细节：小巧但不很直的鼻子，还有甜美动人的双唇。她脸部的活力和美丽都源自那双眼睛。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's from my mother to her second husband twelve years ago. She mentions a lady from Hampshire called Mrs Catherick, who had come to look after her sick sister living in the village. It seems she brought her only child with her, a little girl called Anne, who was about a year older than Laura. I was at a school in Paris at the time. My mother, who took a great interest in the village school, says the little girl was slow in learning so she gave her lessons here at the house. She also gave her some of Laura's white dresses and white hats, saying she looked better in white than any other colour. She says that little Anne Catherick was so grateful, and loved her so much, that one day she kissed her hand and said, "I'll always wear white as long as I live. It will help me to remember you.""</div>

<div class="line_en">By the third month of my stay in Cumberland, I was lost in dreams of love and blind to the dangers ahead of me. Then the first warning finally came -- from her. In the space of one night, she changed towards me. There was a sudden nervous distance, and a kind of sadness, in her attitude. The pain I felt at that moment is beyond description. But I knew then that she had changed because she had suddenly discovered not only my feelings, but her own as well. This change was also reflected in Miss Halcombe, who said nothing unusual to me, but who had developed a new habit of always watching me. This new and awful situation continued for some time until, on a Thursday, near the end of the third month, I was at last rescued by the sensible and courageous Miss Halcombe.</div>

<div class="line_en">We walked to the summer-house and went inside. Miss Halcombe turned to me. "Mr Hartright, what I have to say to you I can say here. Now, I know that you are a good man who always acts correctly. Your story about that unhappy woman in London proves that. As your friend, I must tell you that I have discovered your feelings for my sister, Laura. Although you have done nothing wrong, except show weakness, I must tell you to leave Limmeridge House before any harm is done. And there is something else I must tell you, which will also give you pain. Will you shake hands with your friend, Marian Halcombe, first?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们来到凉亭，走了进去。哈尔库姆小姐转向我；“哈特里特先生，我要向你说的话在这儿可以说了。我知道你是一位举止得体的好人，你跟我讲的关于伦敦那个不幸女人的事证明了这一点。但是，作为你的朋友，我必须告诉你，我发现了你对我妹妹劳拉的感情。除了表现得有些软弱，你没做错什么，不过我还是必须劝你在造成伤害之前离开利默里奇庄园。我还有些事要告诉你，可能会让你痛苦。你能不能先和你的朋友玛丽安·哈尔库姆握握手？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You must put an end to your feelings, here, where you first met her. I will hide nothing from you. She is not marrying for love, but because of a promise she made to her father just before he died. The man she is to marry arrives here next Monday."</div>
