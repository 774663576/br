<div class="line_en">Once upon a time there was a sorcerer who disguised himself as a poor man, went begging from house to house, and captured beautiful girls. No one knew where he took them, for none of them ever returned.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从前有个巫师，装作穷人，挨家挨户地乞讨，而实际上他是碰到漂亮姑娘就抓。谁也说不上他把姑娘们抓到哪儿去了，因为他带走的姑娘没有一个回来过。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One day he came to the door of a man who had three beautiful daughters. He appeared to be a poor, weak beggar, and he carried a pack basket on his back, as though he wanted to collect some benevolent offerings in it. He asked for a bit to eat, and when the oldest daughter came out to give him a piece of bread, he simply touched her, and she was forced to jump into his pack basket. Then he hurried away with powerful strides and carried her to his house, which stood in the middle of a dark forest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一天，他来到一家人门口，这家人有三个漂亮的姑娘。他背着一个篮子，像是准备装人们施舍的东西，样子活像个身体虚弱、令人怜悯的乞丐。他求那家人给他点吃的，於是大女儿走了出来。巫师不用碰她，姑娘就会不自觉地跳进他的篮子，然后他就迈着大步朝密林深处自己的住所逃去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="最后她来到那间禁室，想走过去不看，可好奇心驱使她掏出了钥匙，想看看和其他的有甚么不同，於是将钥匙插进了锁孔。门「哗」地弹开了，她走了进去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She was so terrified that the egg, which she was holding in her hand, fell into the basin. She got it out again and wiped off the blood, but it was to no avail, for it always came back. She wiped and scrubbed, but she could not get rid of the stain.</div>

In spite of this she proceeded to gather their parts together, placing them back in order: head, body, arms, and legs. Then, when nothing else was missing, the parts began to move.
