<div class="line_en">Every day, James drove home from the college -- where he taught his cowboy class term after term after term, until he could recite the lectures word for word -- mulling over the slights of the day: how two little girls, hopscotching on the corner, had seen him brake at the stop sign and thrown pebbles at his car; how Stan Hewitt had asked him the difference between a spring roll and an egg roll; how Mrs. Allen had smirked when he drove past. Only when he reached home and saw Lydia did the bitter smog dissipate. For her, he thought, everything would be different. She would have friends to say, Don't be an idiot, Stan, how the hell would she know? She would be poised and confident; she would say, Afternoon, Vivian, and look right at her neighbors with those wide blue eyes. Every day, the thought grew more precious.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ten years later it had still not come undone. Years passed. Boys went to war; men went to the moon; presidents arrived and resigned and departed. All over the country, in Detroit and Washington and New York, crowds roiled in the streets, angry about everything. All over the world, nations splintered and cracked: North Vietnam, East Berlin, Bangladesh. Everywhere things came undone. But for the Lees, that knot persisted and tightened, as if Lydia bound them all together.</div>

<div class="line_en">Every day, as Marilyn unboxed a frozen pie or defrosted a Salisbury steak -- for she still refused to cook, and the family quietly accepted this as the price of her presence -- she made plans: Books she would buy Lydia. Science fair projects. Summer classes. "Only if you're interested," she told Lydia, every time. "Only if you want to." She meant it, every time, but she did not realize she was holding her breath. Lydia did. Yes, she said, every time. Yes. Yes. And her mother would breathe again. In the newspaper -- which, between loads of washing, Marilyn read front to back, metering out the day, section by section -- she saw glimmers of hope. Yale admitted women, then Harvard. The nation learned new words: affirmative action; Equal Rights Amendment; Ms. In her mind, Marilyn spun out Lydia's future in one long golden thread, the future she was positive her daughter wanted, too: Lydia in high heels and a white coat, a stethoscope round her neck; Lydia bent over an operating table, a ring of men awed at her deft handiwork. Every day, it seemed more possible.</div>

<div class="line_en">Every day, at the dinner table, Nath sat quietly while his father quizzed Lydia about her friends, while his mother nudged Lydia about her classes. When they turned, dutifully, to him, he was tongue-tied, because his father -- still seared by the memory of a smashed television and his son's slapped face, did not ever want to hear about space. And that was all Nath read or thought about. In his spare moments, he worked his way through every book in the school card catalog. Spaceflight. Astrodynamics. See also: combustion; propulsion; satellites. After a few stuttering replies, the spotlight would swivel back to Lydia, and Nath would retreat to his room and his aeronautics magazines, which he stashed under his bed like pornography. He did not mind this permanent state of eclipse: every evening, Lydia rapped at his door, silent and miserable. He understood everything she did not say, which at its core was: Don't let go. When Lydia left -- to struggle over her homework or a science fair project -- he turned his telescope outward, looking for faraway stars, far-off places where he might one day venture alone.</div>

<div class="line_en">And Lydia herself -- the reluctant center of their universe -- every day, she held the world together. She absorbed her parents' dreams, quieting the reluctance that bubbled up within. Years passed. Johnson and Nixon and Ford came and went. She grew willowy; Nath grew tall. Creases formed around their mother's eyes; their father's hair silvered at the temples. Lydia knew what they wanted so desperately, even when they didn't ask. Every time, it seemed such a small thing to trade for their happiness. So she studied algebra in the summertime. She put on a dress and went to the freshman dance. She enrolled in biology at the college, Monday, Wednesday, Friday, all summer long. Yes. Yes. Yes.</div>

<div class="line_en">(What about Hannah? They set up her nursery in the bedroom in the attic, where things that were not wanted were kept, and even when she got older, now and then each of them would forget, fleetingly, that she existed -- as when Marilyn, laying four plates for dinner one night, did not realize her omission until Hannah reached the table. Hannah, as if she understood her place in the cosmos, grew from quiet infant to watchful child: a child fond of nooks and corners, who curled up in closets, behind sofas, under dangling tablecloths, staying out of sight as well as out of mind, to ensure the terrain of the family did not change.)</div>

<div class="line_en">A decade after that terrible year, everything had turned upside down. For the rest of the world, 1976 was a topsy-turvy time, too, culminating in an unusually cold winter and strange headlines: Snow Falls on Miami. Lydia was fifteen and a half, and winter break had just begun. In five months she would be dead. That December, alone in her room, she opened her bookbag and pulled out a physics test with a red fifty-five at the top.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在，距离那可怕的一年，已经过去了十年，一切都发生了翻天覆地的变化。对其他人而言，1976年也并非寻常的一年，这种反常在那个出奇寒冷的冬天达到了顶峰——报纸的头版赫然印着《迈阿密下雪了》这种标题。十五岁半的莉迪亚刚开始放寒假，再过五个月，她就死了。那年十二月，她独自待在屋里打开书包，拽出一张物理试卷，卷子顶端用红笔写着“55”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The biology course had been hard enough, but by memorizing kingdom, phylum, and class she'd passed the first few tests. Then, as the course got tougher, she had gotten lucky: the boy who sat to her right studied hard, wrote large, and never covered up his answers. "My daughter," Marilyn had said that fall to Mrs. Wolff -- Doctor Wolff --"is a genius. An A in a college class, and the only girl, too." So Lydia had never told her mother that she didn't understand the Krebs cycle, that she couldn't explain mitosis. When her mother framed the grade report from the college, she hung it on her wall and pretended to smile.</div>

<div class="line_en">After biology, Marilyn had other suggestions. "We'll skip you ahead in science this fall," she'd said. "After college biology, I'm sure high school physics will be a snap." Lydia, knowing this was her mother's pet subject, had agreed. "You'll meet some of the older students," her father had told her, "and make some new friends." He'd winked, remembering how at Lloyd, older had meant better. But the juniors all talked to each other, comparing French translations due next period or memorizing Shakespeare for the quiz that afternoon; to Lydia they were merely polite, with the distant graciousness of natives in a place where she was a foreigner. And the problems about car crashes, shooting cannons, skidding trucks on frictionless ice -- she couldn't make the answers turn out. Race cars on banked tracks, roller coasters with loops, pendulums and weights: around and around, back and forth she went. The more she thought about it, the less sense it made. Why didn't the race cars tip over? Why didn't the roller coaster fall from its track? When she tried to figure out why, gravity reached up and pulled down the cars like a trailing ribbon. Each night when she sat down with her book, the equations -- studded with k and M and theta -- seemed pointed and dense as brambles. Above her desk, on the postcard her mother had given her, Einstein stuck out his tongue.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="生物课之后，玛丽琳又提出了新的建议。“今年秋天，我们直接让你选修自然科学。”她说，“搞定了大学生物课，我相信高中物理也不在话下。”莉迪亚知道，这是母亲最喜欢讨论的话题，她只能点头称是。“你会遇到年纪大的学生，”她父亲说，“认识一些新的朋友。”他眨眨眼，想起在劳埃德学院，“年纪大”意味着“更优秀”。然而，高二的学生们只和他们自己的同学说话——要么对法语翻译作业的答案，要么背诵当天下午将要测验的莎士比亚剧本。他们对莉迪亚仅仅是以礼相待，脸上带着本地人漠然的和蔼，把莉迪亚当成外国人一样。至于那些物理应用题——两车相撞、打出的炮弹、冰面上侧滑的卡车什么的——她绞尽脑汁也想不出答案。转弯中的卡车上装载的赛车、旋转的过山车、钟摆和砝码……这些东西如影随形地跟着她，她越想越觉得它们没有意义。为什么赛车会掉下来？为什么过山车会脱轨？当她试图搞清楚为什么的时候，仿佛看到地心引力窜了出来，把所有的车一连串地拽下去，仿佛扯着一条带子。晚上读书的时候，那些方程式——掺杂着小写的k和大写的M，还有希腊字母Θ——似乎变成了长满尖刺、密密麻麻的荆棘。书桌上方，母亲送给她的明信片上，爱因斯坦朝她吐着舌头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Each test score had been lower than the last, reading like a strange weather forecast: ninety in September, mid-eighties in October, low seventies in November, sixties before Christmas. The exam before this one, she'd managed a sixty-two -- technically passing, but hardly passable. After class, she'd shredded it into penny-sized scraps and fed it down the third-floor toilet before coming home. Now there was the fifty-five, which, like a bright light, made her squint, even though Mr. Kelly hadn't written the F at the top of the page. She'd stashed it in her locker for two weeks under a stack of textbooks, as if the combined weight of algebra and history and geography might snuff it out. Mr. Kelly had been asking her about it, hinting that he could call her parents himself, if necessary, and finally Lydia promised to bring it back after Christmas break with her mother's signature.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的测验得分越来越低，看上去就像一张诡异的天气预报图表：九月份90，十月份85，十一月不到75，圣诞节前60左右。上一次考试，她得了62分，算是及格，但是差点不及格。下课后，她把卷子撕成小块丢进三楼厕所，然后才回家。现在，她考了55分，尽管凯利老师没在卷子上写“F”，但她还是不敢正眼去看那触目惊心的红色分数。她把这张卷子塞进储物柜藏了两周，放在一摞教科书下面，仿佛代数、历史和地理课本的重量合起来会把它压死一样。凯利老师向她提过她成绩下降的事，暗示说，他可能会亲自给她父母打电话——如果有必要的话。最后莉迪亚保证，过了圣诞节假期，她就把母亲签过字的卷子拿回学校。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For the past few weeks, Nath had checked the mail every afternoon, even before he said hello to their mother, sometimes before he took off his shoes. Lydia could feel him aching to escape so badly that everything else was falling away. Last week, at breakfast, Marilyn had leaned Lydia's marked-up math homework against the box of Wheaties. "I checked it last night after you went to bed," she said. "There's a mistake in number twenty-three, sweetheart." Five years, a year, even six months earlier, Lydia would have found sympathy in her brother's eyes. I know. I know. Confirmation and consolation in a single blink. This time Nath, immersed in a library book, did not notice Lydia's clenched fingers, the sudden red that rimmed her eyes. Dreaming of his future, he no longer heard all the things she did not say.</div>

Part of her hoped that, somehow, it would have changed; that over the past eight days the words would have eroded so she could blow them away like soot, leaving nothing but a harmless blank page. But when she blew, just one quick puff, the paper quivered. The letters clung.

<div class="line_en">He had been the only one listening for so long. Since their mother's disappearance and return, Lydia had been friendless. Every recess that first fall, she had stood to the side, staring at the First Federal clock in the distance. Each time a minute ticked by, she squeezed her eyes shut and pictured what her mother might be doing -- scrubbing the counter, filling the kettle, peeling an orange -- as if the weight of all those details could keep her mother there. Later she would wonder if this had made her miss her chance, or if she had ever had a chance at all. One day she had opened her eyes and found Stacey Sherwin standing before her: Stacey Sherwin of the waist-long golden hair, surrounded by a gaggle of girls. In Middlewood's kindergarten class, Stacey Sherwin was the kingmaker, already adept at wielding her power. A few days earlier, she had announced, "Jeannine Collins stinks like garbage water," and Jeannine Collins had peeled away from the group, ripping her glasses from her tear-smudged face, while the other girls in Stacey's coterie tittered. Lydia, from a safe distance, had watched this unfold with awe. Only once, on the first day of kindergarten, had Stacey spoken to her directly: "Do Chinese people celebrate Thanksgiving?" And: "Do Chinese people have belly buttons?"</div>

In the years to come, Lydia would watch Stacey Sherwin -- her golden hair braided, then ironed flat, then feathered -- waving to her friends, pulling them toward her, the way a rhinestone caught and held the light. She would see Jenn Pittman slip a note to Pam Saunders and see Pam Saunders unfold it beneath her desk and snicker; she would watch Shelley Brierley share out a pack of Doublemint and breathe in the sugar-spearmint scent as the foil-wrapped sticks passed her by.</div>

<div class="line_en">Only Nath had made it bearable all that time. Every day, since kindergarten, he saved her a seat -- in the cafeteria, a chair across the table from him; on the bus, his books placed beside him on the green vinyl seat. If she arrived first, she saved a seat for him. Because of Nath, she never had to ride home alone while everyone else chatted sociably in pairs; she never needed to gulp out, "Can I sit here?" and risk being turned away. They never discussed it, but both came to understand it as a promise: he would always make sure there was a place for her. She would always be able to say, Someone is coming. I am not alone.</div>

<div class="line_en">Downstairs, Nath riffled through the pile of mail: a grocery circular, an electric bill. No letter. That fall, when the guidance counselor had asked Nath about his career plans, he had whispered, as if telling her a dirty secret. "Space," he'd said. "Outer space." Mrs. Hendrich had clicked her pen twice, in-out, and he thought she was going to laugh. It had been nearly five years since the last trip to the moon, and the nation, having bested the Soviets, had turned its attention elsewhere. Instead Mrs. Hendrich told him there were two routes: become a pilot or become a scientist. She flipped a folder open to his printed-out transcript. B-minus in phys ed; A-plus in trigonometry, calculus, biology, physics. Though Nath dreamed of MIT, or Carnegie Mellon, or Caltech -- he'd even written for pamphlets -- he knew there was only one place his father would approve: Harvard. To James, anything else was a failing. Once he got to college, Nath told himself, he would take advanced physics, material science, aerodynamics. College would be a jumping-off point for a million places he had never been, a stop-off at the moon before shooting into space. He would leave everything and everyone behind -- and though he wouldn't admit it to himself, everyone meant Lydia, too.</div>

<div class="line_en">Lydia was fifteen now, taller, and at school, when she tied her hair up and put on lipstick, she looked grown up. At home, she looked like the same startled five-year-old who had clung to his hand as they crawled back ashore. When she stood near, the little-girl scent of her perfume -- even its name childish, Baby Soft -- wafted from her skin. Ever since that summer, he had felt something still binding their ankles and tugging him off balance, fettering her weight to his. For ten years, that something had not loosened, and now it had begun to chafe. All those years, as the only other person who understood their parents, he had absorbed her miseries, offering silent sympathy or a squeeze on the shoulder or a wry smile. He would say, Mom's always bragging about you to Dr. Wolff. When I got that A-plus in chem, she didn't even notice. Or, Remember when I didn't go to the ninth grade formal? Dad said, "Well, I guess if you can't get a date…" He had buoyed her up with how too much love was better than too little.

<div class="line_en">It was almost Christmas now, and still no letter from Harvard. Nath went into the living room without turning on the lamp, letting the colored lights on the tree guide his way. Each blackened windowpane reflected back a tiny Christmas tree. He would have to type new essays and wait for a second or third or fourth choice, or maybe he'd have to stay home forever. His father's voice carried from the kitchen: "I think she'll really like it. As soon as I saw it, I thought of her." No need for an antecedent -- in their family, she was always Lydia. As the Christmas lights blinked on and off, the living room appeared, dimly, then disappeared again. Nath closed his eyes when the lights came on, opened them as they went off, so that he saw only uninterrupted darkness. Then the doorbell rang.</div>

<div class="line_en">That night, while Nath brushed his teeth, the bathroom door creaked open and Lydia appeared, leaning against the doorjamb. Her face was pale, almost gray, and for a moment he felt sorry for her. Over dinner, their mother had moved from frantic questions -- how could she let this happen, didn't she realize -- to blunt statements: "Imagine yourself older and unable to find a job. Just imagine it." Lydia hadn't argued, and faced with her daughter's silence, Marilyn had found herself repeating that dire warning again and again. "Do you think you'll just find a man and get married? Is that all you plan for your life?" It had been all she could do to keep from crying right there at the table. After half an hour, James said, "Marilyn --" but she had glared so fiercely that he subsided, prodding shreds of pot roast in the separating onion-soup gravy.

<div class="line_en">The next morning, Marilyn thumbtacked the failed test to the kitchen wall across from Lydia's seat. For the next three days, from breakfast until dinner, she plopped the physics book in front of her daughter and sat down beside her. All Lydia needed, she thought, was a little encouragement. Momentum and inertia, kinetic and potential -- these things still lingered in the corners of her own mind.

Lydia had refused to speak to Nath since that night -- as she thought of it -- and she suspected, correctly, that he was angry at her as well; he avoided the kitchen entirely, except for meals. Even Hannah would have been some comfort -- a small and silent buffer -- but as usual, she was nowhere to be seen. In actuality, Hannah had planted herself under the end table in the foyer, just out of sight of the kitchen, listening to the scratch of Lydia's pencil. She hugged her knees and sent soft and patient thoughts, but her sister did not hear them.

<div class="line_en">Sitting down around the Christmas tree felt sullied now, too. James lifted one ribboned package after another from the pile, handing each around, but Lydia dreaded the gift from her mother. Usually her mother gave her books -- books that, although neither of them fully realized it, her mother secretly wanted herself, and which, after Christmas, Marilyn would sometimes borrow from Lydia's shelf. To Lydia, they were always too hard no matter what age she was, less presents than unsubtle hints. Last year, it was The Color Atlas of Human Anatomy, so large it wouldn't fit on the shelf upright; the year before, she had received a thick volume called Famous Women of Science. The famous women had bored her. Their stories were all the same: told they couldn't; decided to anyway. Because they really wanted to, she wondered, or because they were told not to? And the anatomy had made her queasy -- men and women with their skin peeled off, then their muscles stripped away, until they were nothing but skeletons laid bare. She'd flipped through some of the color plates and slammed the book and squirmed in her seat, as if she could shake off the feeling like a dog shook rain off its fur.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="围坐在圣诞树下拆礼物也无法改善莉迪亚的心情。詹姆斯把缠着彩带的包裹接连分发给大家，但莉迪亚害怕看到母亲给她的礼物：玛丽琳通常会送她书。实际上——虽然母女俩都没有完全意识到——是玛丽琳自己想读这些书，因为圣诞节过后，她有时会从莉迪亚那里把书借走。对莉迪亚而言，无论她年龄多大，这些书都太难懂。这不像是礼物，更像某种笨拙的暗示。去年，母亲送的是《人体解剖学彩色图集》，开本很大，没法垂直插进书架；前年，莉迪亚收到的是《著名的科学女性》，厚厚一本。那些著名的女性令她厌烦。她们的故事大同小异：别人说她们做不到，但她们还是决心去做。莉迪亚想，这是因为她们真心想做，还是因为别人不赞成？人体解剖图令她作呕——男人和女人被剥掉了皮、揭开了肌肉，只剩下光溜溜的骨架。她胡乱翻了几页就合上书，在座位上不安分地扭动，就像狗抖掉身上的雨水一样，想把恶心的感觉甩掉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">If she had not looked up at the ceiling just then, Lydia might have forgiven her brother after all. But something caught her eye -- a Rorschach of white above their heads -- and a tiny memory ballooned in her mind. They had been quite small. Her mother had taken Hannah to a doctor's appointment and she and Nath, home alone, had spotted a huge spider crawling just above the window frame. Nath had climbed the sofa and crushed it with their father's shoe, leaving a black smudge and half a footprint on the ceiling. "Say you did it," he'd begged, but Lydia had a better idea. She fetched the bottle of Liquid Paper from beside their father's typewriter and painted over each spot, one by one. Their parents never noticed the dots of white against the cream of the ceiling, and for months afterward, she and Nath would glance up and share a smile.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="要是她没有接着望向天花板，莉迪亚可能很快就会原谅她哥哥。一样东西——他们头顶的白色斑块——吸引了她的视线，触发了她的一段回忆。他们很小的时候，有一次玛丽琳带着汉娜去看医生，只有莉迪亚和内斯在家，他们看到一只大蜘蛛在窗框上爬，内斯踩着沙发，用父亲的鞋拍死了蜘蛛，在天花板上留下一块黑斑和半只鞋底的印迹。“就说是你干的。”内斯恳求道，但莉迪亚有个更好的主意。她从詹姆斯的打字机旁边拿来修正液，一点一点地把黑色印痕涂成白色，父母根本没注意到奶油色天花板上的白点。此后的几个月，她和内斯一抬头看到那块白斑，就会相视而笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Nath, watching his sister's eyes blink and redden, felt a twinge of pity cut through his anger. He had read the letter from Harvard eleven times now and had finally convinced himself it was real: they had actually accepted him. In nine months, he would be gone, and that knowledge took the sting out of all that had happened. So what if his parents cared more about Lydia's failure than his success? He was leaving. And when he got to college -- Lydia would have to stay behind. The thought, finally put into words, was bittersweet. As his father passed him a present wrapped in red foil, Nath flashed Lydia a tentative smile, which she pretended not to see. After three comfortless days, she was not ready to forgive him yet, but the gesture warmed her, like a gulp of tea on a cold winter day.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="内斯看着他妹妹眨着眼睛，眼圈变红，顿时从愤怒中生出一丝怜悯。他已经把哈佛的来信读了十一遍，终于说服自己这是真的，他们真的录取了他。再过九个月，他就可以走了，这个消息驱散了他的所有不快。不过，要是比起他的成功，父母更关心莉迪亚的失败呢？反正他要走了，他要上大学了——而莉迪亚不得不留在家里。他现在的感觉，用四个字来形容，就是“苦乐参半”。这时，他父亲递给他一个用红色锡纸包着的礼物，内斯试探地向莉迪亚微笑了一下，她假装没看见。度过了不自由的三天，她还没做好原谅他的准备，但内斯的态度温暖了她，如同在寒冷的冬日咽下一大口热茶。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Now, looking carefully, Lydia could still see the faint tread of their father's shoe, the bigger splotch where the spider had been. They had been a team. They had stuck together, even in this small, silly thing. She had never expected a time when that would not be true. Morning light splashed across the wall, making shadows and spots of glare. She squinted, trying to distinguish white from off-white.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Lydia?" Everyone else had been busy, unwrapping gifts: across the room, Nath fed a roll of film into a new camera; a ruby pendant on a gold chain gleamed against her mother's robe. In front of her, her father held out a package, small and compact and sharp-edged, like a jewel box. "From me. I picked it out myself." He beamed. Usually James left the Christmas shopping to Marilyn, allowing her to sign each tag Love, Mom and Dad. But he had picked this gift out himself, and he could not wait to bestow it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“莉迪亚。”她循声望去，其他人都在忙着拆礼物。内斯正把一卷新胶片装进相机；她母亲戴着一条金链子，链坠是红宝石的，在睡袍的映衬下闪闪发光。站在她面前的父亲递过来一小只包裹，看上去很结实，边角锐利，像是一只珠宝盒。“这是我的礼物。我自己挑的。”他笑容满面。詹姆斯通常会把圣诞采购的任务交给玛丽琳，让她在礼品卡上签名：爱你的妈妈和爸爸。但这一次，他特地为莉迪亚挑选了礼物，而且迫不及待地交给了她。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A present he picked out himself, Lydia thought, must be something special. At once she forgave her father for not interceding. Beneath this wrapping was something delicate and precious. She imagined a gold necklace like some girls at school wore and never took off, little gold crosses they'd received at their confirmations, or tiny charms that nestled between their collarbones. A necklace from her father would be like that. It would make up for the books from her mother, for all of the past three days. It would be a little reminder that said I love you. You're perfect just as you are.</div>

She remembered this the next time she lifted the receiver and held it to her ear, murmuring, "mm-hmm, mm-hm -- she did?" until her father passed through the front hallway, paused below, smiled, and moved on. As time went by, she would picture the girls she watched from afar and imagine what she'd say if they were truly friends. "Shelley, did you watch Starsky and Hutch last night? Oh my god, Pam, can you believe that English essay -- ten pages? Does Mrs. Gregson think we have nothing better to do? Stacey, your new hairdo makes you look exactly like Farrah Fawcett.

He was apologizing for giving her the silent treatment, for shutting the door in her face when all she'd wanted was not to be alone. Lydia knew this, but she was not in the mood to make up. In a few months he would be gone, and she would be left alone to win friends and influence people and pioneer in science. Before Nath could snap the photo, she dropped her gaze back to the book, hair curtaining her face. A smile says, "I like you. You make me happy. I am glad to see you." That is why dogs make such a hit. They are so glad to see us that they almost jump out of their skins. Dogs, Lydia thought. She tried to picture herself as a dog, something docile and friendly, a golden retriever with a black smile and a fringy tail, but she did not feel friendly and purebred and blond. She felt unsociable and suspicious, like the Wolffs' dog down the street, a mutt, braced for hostility.</div>

Unit II: Electricity and Magnetism, he wrote at the top. Lydia slid into her seat and rested her cheek on the desktop. Someone had etched a dime-sized FUCK YOU into the surface with a pushpin. She pressed her thumb against it, and when she lifted her hand a backward FUCK rose on her fingertip like a welt.</div>

He was focused on something she couldn't see, ignoring Mr. Kelly's drone, the pencils scratching around him, the fluorescent light buzzing overhead. One thumb drummed a pitter-pat on the desktop. Does Jack Wolff want to be friends? she wondered. Nath would kill him. Or me. But after that first day, Jack didn't say another word to her. Some days he came late, then put his head down on his desk for the entire period; some days he did not come at all. The zero washed out in the laundry. Lydia kept her head bent over her notes.

<div class="line_en">Then, at the end of January, at dinner, her mother passed the salad and the dish of Hamburger Helper and looked at Lydia expectantly, tilting her head this way and that, like a pair of rabbit ears trying to catch the signal.

The last time she'd talked to Karen was over a year ago, when her father had chauffeured them home from a matinee of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. At first she'd been proud that, for once, her plans had not been a lie. Karen had just moved to town and Lydia, emboldened by her newness, had suggested a movie and Karen had said, "Okay, sure, why not." Then, for the whole ride, her father had tried to show off how cool he was: "Five brothers and sisters, Karen? Just like the Brady Bunch! You watch that show?"</div>

Karen had said, "Yeah," and "No," and "I don't know" and fiddled with the bottom bead of her earring. Lydia had wanted to melt and seep into the seat cushions, deep down where the foam would block every bit of sound. She thought of saying something about the movie, but couldn't think of anything. All she could think of was Jack Nicholson's vacant eyes as the pillow came down to smother him. The silence swelled to fill the car until they pulled up in front of Karen's house.</div>

<div class="line_en">At the beginning, it seemed impossible. Jack hadn't come to class in nearly a week, and she hovered near his car after school for days before she caught him alone. The first day, he came out of the building with a blond junior she didn't know, and she ducked behind a bush and watched through the branches. Jack slid his hands into the girl's pocket, then inside her coat, and when she pretended to be offended and pushed him away, he tossed her over his shoulder, threatening to throw her into the snowbank, while she squealed and giggled and hammered his back with her fists. Then Jack set her down and opened the door of the Beetle, and the blond girl climbed in, and they drove off, steam billowing from the tailpipe, and Lydia knew they wouldn't be back. The second day, Jack didn't show up at all, and Lydia eventually trudged home. The snow was calf-deep; there had been record low temperatures all winter. A hundred miles north, Lake Erie had frozen; in Buffalo, snow drowned the roofs of houses, swallowing power lines. At home, Nath, who had sat alone on the bus for the first time he could remember, demanded, "What happened to you?" and Lydia stomped upstairs without replying.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="起初，这个心愿似乎难以实现。杰克几乎一周没有来上课了，放学后，她在他的汽车附近徘徊，终于发现了他的踪影。第一天，他从教学楼里出来，身边跟着一个金头发的高二女生。莉迪亚并不认识她，她蹲在树丛后面，透过树枝的空隙向外看。杰克把手伸进女孩的口袋，然后又滑进她的外衣，当她假装受到冒犯要推开他的时候，他一下子把她扛起来，威胁说要把她扔进路边的雪堆。女孩又叫又笑，拳头捶打着杰克的背。杰克放下她，敞开“甲壳虫”的车门，金发女孩钻进去，汽车开走了，排气管里冒出滚滚烟尘。莉迪亚知道，他们今天不会回来了。第二天，杰克没有露面，守候未果的莉迪亚只得疲惫地回家。积雪已经没到人们的小腿肚，这年冬天的最低气温突破了历史记录，向北一百英里处的伊利湖结了冰；布法罗的雪淹没了屋顶，吞噬了供电线路。在米德伍德，内斯头一次独自坐在校车上。回家后，看到莉迪亚，他问：“你是怎么了？”莉迪亚跺着脚上了楼，没有回答。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You know who's in my physics class now?" she said suddenly. "Jack Wolff, from down the street." She nibbled a shred of iceberg and measured her family's reaction. To her parents, the name slid past as if she hadn't spoken. Her mother said, "Lyddie, that reminds me, I could help you go over your notes on Saturday, if you want." Her father said, "I haven't seen Karen in a while. Why don't you two go to a movie sometime? I'll drive you." But Nath's head, across the table, jerked up as if a rifle had gone off. Lydia smiled back down at her plate. And right then she decided that she and Jack were going to be friends.</div>

<div class="line_en">Now that she was in the car, she didn't know what to say. Jack started the engine and eased the car into gear, and the big speedometer and gas gauge on the dashboard flicked to life. There were no other dials. Lydia thought of her parents' cars: all the indicators and warning lights to tell you if the oil was too low, if the engine was too hot, if you were driving with the parking brake on or the door or the trunk or the hood open. They didn't trust you. They needed to check you constantly, to remind you what to do and what not to do. She had never been alone with a boy before -- her mother had forbidden her to go out with boys, not that she had ever tried -- and it occurred to her that she had never had an actual conversation with Jack before. She had only a vague idea about the things that happened in the backseat. Out of the corner of her eye, she studied Jack's profile, the faint stubble -- darker than his sandy hair -- that ran all the way up to his sideburns and all the way down to the soft part of his throat, like a smudge of charcoal waiting to be wiped away.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“他又不是我的保姆。”她无意识地提高了声音说。杰克笑了，喷出一团白烟，钻进车里。莉迪亚红着脸上了车，杰克靠过来锁副驾驶这边的车门时，她差点尴尬得转身离开。">查看中文翻译</div>

"I'm not a child," she said, lighting the cigarette and putting it to her lips. The smoke burned in her lungs and made her head spin and suddenly she felt sharp and aware. Like cutting your finger, she thought: the pain, and the blood, reminded you that you were alive. She breathed out, a tiny cyclone funneling between her teeth, and held out the lighter. Jack waved a hand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莉迪亚无法忽略他语气中的鄙视，她不确定杰克是在取笑她还是内斯，或者同时嘲笑他们两个人。“我又不是小孩。”她点燃香烟，往嘴里一塞。烟雾灼烧她的肺，让她头晕，但接着，她就来了精神。像切手指一样，她想，疼痛和血提醒你，你还活着。她往外吐气，一小股白烟旋转着从牙缝中钻出来，她递过打火机，杰克摆摆手。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Abruptly, Jack pulled to the side of the road. They had just reached the lake, and his eyes were cold and still, like the iced-over water behind him. "Maybe you'd better get out, then. You don't want someone like me corrupting you. Ruining your chances of getting into Harvard like your brother."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰克突然把车往路边一停，他们刚抵达湖边。他的眼神阴冷平静，就像他身后结冰的水面。“也许你还是下车比较好，既然你不想让我这样的人把你带坏，毁掉你和你哥哥一样上哈佛的机会。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He must really hate Nath, Lydia thought. As much as Nath hates him. She imagined them in class together all these years: Nath sitting close to the front, notebook out, one hand rubbing the little furrow between his eyebrows, the way he did when he was thinking hard. Utterly focused, oblivious to everything else, the answer right there, sealed inside his mouth. And Jack? Jack would be sprawled in the back corner, shirt untucked, one leg stretched into the aisle. So comfortable. So certain of himself. Not worried about what anyone thought. No wonder they couldn't stand each other.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他一定真的讨厌内斯，莉迪亚想，像内斯讨厌他一样。她想象着他们是怎么上课的：内斯坐在前排，笔记本摊开，一只手摩挲着眉心的皱纹，这是他苦思冥想时的招牌动作。他聚精会神，浑然忘我，终于得出答案。杰克呢？杰克一定是趴在后排的角落里，敞着衬衫，跷着二郎腿，一派安逸，洋洋自得，根本不在乎别人对他的看法。难怪他们两人合不来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jack studied her for a long moment, as if trying to decide if this were true. Beneath the backseat, the engine idled with a growl. The ash at the end of her cigarette lengthened, like a gray worm, but she said nothing, just breathed a thin cloud of fog into the frozen air and forced herself to meet Jack's narrowing gaze.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰克打量了她好一会，似乎在判断她的话是不是真的。甲壳虫汽车后座下的引擎空转着，发出阵阵咆哮。莉迪亚手中的烟卷积了很长一条烟灰，像一条灰虫。她什么都没说，只是在冰冷的空气中吐出一条细线，强迫自己迎接杰克怀疑的审视。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我以为棕色眼睛会胜出。”杰克一只手撑在她座位的头靠上，凑过去仔细研究她，好像珠宝商在观察宝石。莉迪亚觉得脖子后面非常不自在，她扭头把烟灰掸进烟灰缸。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“有可能。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What's it like?" Lydia hesitated. Sometimes you almost forgot: that you didn't look like everyone else. In homeroom or at the drugstore or at the supermarket, you listened to morning announcements or dropped off a roll of film or picked out a carton of eggs and felt like just another someone in the crowd. Sometimes you didn't think about it at all. And then sometimes you noticed the girl across the aisle watching, the pharmacist watching, the checkout boy watching, and you saw yourself reflected in their stares: incongruous. Catching the eye like a hook. Every time you saw yourself from the outside, the way other people saw you, you remembered all over again. You saw it in the sign at the Peking Express -- a cartoon man with a coolie hat, slant eyes, buckteeth, and chopsticks. You saw it in the little boys on the playground, stretching their eyes to slits with their fingers -- Chinese -- Japanese -- look at these -- and in the older boys who muttered ching chong ching chong ching as they passed you on the street, just loud enough for you to hear. You saw it when waitresses and policemen and bus drivers spoke slowly to you, in simple words, as if you might not understand. You saw it in photos, yours the only black head of hair in the scene, as if you'd been cut out and pasted in. You thought: Wait, what's she doing there? And then you remembered that she was you. You kept your head down and thought about school, or space, or the future, and tried to forget about it. And you did, until it happened again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“什么什么感觉？”莉迪亚迟疑道。有时候，你几乎会忘了这一点——你看上去和别人不一样。在教室、药店或者超市，当你听到铃声、掉下一盒胶卷或者选出一箱鸡蛋的时候，你会觉得自己和其他人一样，有时你根本不会想到这个问题。其他时候，你会发现，走廊对面的女孩在看你，药剂师盯着你，收银员也在盯着你，你这才意识到自己在他们眼中的形象，格格不入。他们的眼神仿佛带着钩子。每次站在他们的视角看自己，都会再次体验那种感觉，想起自己的与众不同。你一定见过电影《北平快车》里面的标志性形象——扛箱子的中国小工，戴着苦力帽，眼睛歪斜，牙齿突出，吃饭用筷子；也在操场上见过那些男孩对着同学指指点点——中国人——日本人——快看他们；在街上，大一点的孩子嘟囔着“ching chong ching chong”与你擦身而过，音量不高不低，刚好让你听到。女服务员、警察和公交车司机慢慢和你说话，尽量使用简单的词语，怕你听不懂。合照里面，你是唯一的黑头发，你的形象好像是从别处剪下来贴上去的。你会想：等等，她为什么在那里？又一想，原来“她”就是你。你低着头，想着学校、太空或者未来，试图忘记这件事，当时也确实能忘记，但是，总有人和事能够再次提醒你想起。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jack stayed silent for a long time, staring down at the castle in the center of the steering wheel. They would never be friends now. He hated Nath, and after what she'd just said, he would hate her, too. He would kick her out of the car and drive away. Then, to Lydia's surprise, Jack pulled the pack of cigarettes from his pocket and held it out. A peace offering.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰克注视着方向盘中间的城堡标志沉默良久。他们现在永远成不了朋友。他讨厌内斯，根据她刚才说的话，他也会讨厌她。他完全可以把她踢出车外，扬长而去。然而，莉迪亚惊奇地看到，杰克从口袋里拿出烟盒递了过来。这是表示和解的礼物。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Lydia did not wonder where they would go. She did not think, then, about what excuse she'd offer her mother, the excuse that -- with an inspired smirk -- would be her cover for all her afternoons with Jack: that she'd stayed after school to do physics extra credit. She did not even think about Nath's shocked and anxious face when he learned where she had been. Looking out over the lake, she could not know that in three months she would be at its bottom. At that moment she simply took the proffered cigarette and, as Jack flicked the lighter, touched its tip to the flame.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I dunno," she said. "People decide what you're like before they even get to know you." She eyed him, suddenly fierce. "Kind of like you did with me. They think they know all about you. Except you're never who they think you are."</div>
