<div class="line_en">Philip spent the few weeks that remained before the beginning of the winter session in the out-patients' department, and in October settled down to regular work. He had been away from the hospital for so long that he found himself very largely among new people; the men of different years had little to do with one another, and his contemporaries were now mostly qualified: some had left to take up assistantships or posts in country hospitals and infirmaries, and some held appointments at St. Luke's. The two years during which his mind had lain fallow had refreshed him, he fancied, and he was able now to work with energy.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Athelnys were delighted with his change of fortune. He had kept aside a few things from the sale of his uncle's effects and gave them all presents. He gave Sally a gold chain that had belonged to his aunt. She was now grown up. She was apprenticed to a dressmaker and set out every morning at eight to work all day in a shop in Regent Street. Sally had frank blue eyes, a broad brow, and plentiful shining hair; she was buxom, with broad hips and full breasts; and her father, who was fond of discussing her appearance, warned her constantly that she must not grow fat. She attracted because she was healthy, animal, and feminine. She had many admirers, but they left her unmoved; she gave one the impression that she looked upon love-making as nonsense; and it was easy to imagine that young men found her unapproachable. Sally was old for her years: she had been used to help her mother in the household work and in the care of the children, so that she had acquired a managing air, which made her mother say that Sally was a bit too fond of having things her own way. She did not speak very much, but as she grew older she seemed to be acquiring a quiet sense of humour, and sometimes uttered a remark which suggested that beneath her impassive exterior she was quietly bubbling with amusement at her fellow-creatures. Philip found that with her he never got on the terms of affectionate intimacy upon which he was with the rest of Athelny's huge family. Now and then her indifference slightly irritated him. There was something enigmatic in her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿西尔尼一家看见菲利普走了财运，心里都替他高兴。他从伯伯的遗物里挑了几件留下，送给阿西尔尼家每人一件礼物。他把伯母的金链子送给萨莉。萨莉已经长成亭亭玉立的大姑娘了。她跟着裁缝做学徒，每天一早八点就到摄政街的店铺里工作。她有一双蓝幽幽的、诚恳的大眼睛，两道宽宽的眉毛，浓密的秀发光泽柔顺。她出落得玲珑有致，屁股、胸脯都丰满健美。她的父亲最喜欢谈论女儿的相貌，还不时警告她不能再长胖了。萨莉是个迷人的女孩，健康红润，带着种诱人的气质，女人味十足。追她的小伙子很多，可没有一个能打动她，只好悻悻离去。她给人留下一种印象，即她能把追求者的绵绵情话看成是胡说八道。不难想象，年轻的男士们都会觉得她难以接近。萨莉比她实际的年龄要更成熟，她从很早就开始帮着母亲操持家务、拉扯孩子，所以在她的身上能看到管家婆的影子。她母亲常说，萨莉做什么事都要大包大揽，非得按着自己的想法来。她说话不多，随着年龄的增长，为人越来越幽默，尽管只是三言两语，可是能看出在她冷漠的外表下，充满了对同龄人的好奇与兴趣。菲利普发现，虽然他和阿西尔尼家其他成员相处亲密，但和萨莉之间似乎总隔着一段距离。有时萨莉的冷漠会令他生气。在她身上，有种让人看不透的东西。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip found it always a little difficult to talk to her. She did all that she had to do very competently, but seemed to feel no need of conversation; yet there was nothing unsociable in her. One Sunday afternoon when Athelny and his wife had gone out together, and Philip, treated as one of the family, sat reading in the parlour, Sally came in and sat by the window to sew. The girls' clothes were made at home and Sally could not afford to spend Sundays in idleness. Philip thought she wished to talk and put down his book.</div>

<div class="line_en">After a time it appeared that Sally had a suitor. She went out occasionally with friends she had made in the work-room, and had met a young man, an electrical engineer in a very good way of business, who was a most eligible person. One day she told her mother that he had asked her to marry him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过了一段时间，又有人来追求萨莉了。她偶尔会和店里的朋友出去聚会。有一次，遇到了一个男孩。他在一家生意很好的公司里做电气工程师，条件非常不错。一天，萨莉跟母亲说男孩向她求婚了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was no irony in her tone: she was merely stating a fact. But it suggested to Philip that she measured her father, alas, no longer the hero he was to her childhood, and in her mind joined together his entertaining conversation and the thriftlessness which often brought difficulties into their life; she compared his rhetoric with her mother's practical common sense; and though the liveliness of her father amused her she was perhaps sometimes a little impatient with it. Philip looked at her as she bent over her work; she was healthy, strong, and normal; it must be odd to see her among the other girls in the shop with their flat chests and anaemic faces. Mildred suffered from anaemia.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的语气里完全没有讽刺的意味，她只是在陈述一个事实罢了。可菲利普知道这话里指的正是她的父亲。她已经不像小时候那样把父亲当作大英雄。在她心里，父亲一面是夸夸其谈，招人发笑的活泼形象，一面又大手大脚，不知节俭，经常让全家人作难。她把父亲的花言巧语和母亲朴实无华的言辞作对比，尽管父亲的活泼开朗让她忍俊不禁，可偶尔却也对这种不正经的行为有些不耐烦。菲利普看着她手底忙忙碌碌。她是个健康强壮，平凡无奇的姑娘，但在商店里那群胸前平平、苍白贫血的女孩里，她这样的姑娘一定让人过目难忘。想当初，米尔德里德就有严重的贫血病。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip thought it was a severe ordeal that the young man was being exposed to, since Athelny, in his brown velvet jacket, flowing black tie, and red tarboosh, was a startling spectacle for an innocent electrical engineer. When he came he was greeted by his host with the proud courtesy of a Spanish grandee and by Mrs. Athelny in an altogether homely and natural fashion. They sat down at the old ironing-table in the high-backed monkish chairs, and Mrs. Athelny poured tea out of a lustre teapot which gave a note of England and the country-side to the festivity. She had made little cakes with her own hand, and on the table was home-made jam. It was a farm-house tea, and to Philip very quaint and charming in that Jacobean house. Athelny for some fantastic reason took it into his head to discourse upon Byzantine history; he had been reading the later volumes of the Decline and Fall; and, his forefinger dramatically extended, he poured into the astonished ears of the suitor scandalous stories about Theodora and Irene. He addressed himself directly to his guest with a torrent of rhodomontade; and the young man, reduced to helpless silence and shy, nodded his head at intervals to show that he took an intelligent interest. Mrs. Athelny paid no attention to Thorpe's conversation, but interrupted now and then to offer the young man more tea or to press upon him cake and jam. Philip watched Sally; she sat with downcast eyes, calm, silent, and observant; and her long eye-lashes cast a pretty shadow on her cheek. You could not tell whether she was amused at the scene or if she cared for the young man. She was inscrutable. But one thing was certain: the electrical engineer was good-looking, fair and clean-shaven, with pleasant, regular features, and an honest face; he was tall and well-made. Philip could not help thinking he would make an excellent mate for her, and he felt a pang of envy for the happiness which he fancied was in store for them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普心想，那年轻人可真是要倒大霉了。一个无辜的电气工程师看到穿棕色天鹅绒外套、打黑色飘带、戴红色塔布什帽的阿西尔尼，保准惊得下巴颏都掉到地上。很快，小伙子到了。阿西尔尼以西班牙大公一样趾高气扬又彬彬有礼的态度接待了他，而他身边的阿西尔尼夫人却表现得亲切、自然。他们在熨衣台旁的椅子上坐下来。椅子的靠背很高，坐上去很不舒服。阿西尔尼夫人用亮闪闪的茶壶给他们倒茶，这茶壶给他们带来一些英国乡村独有的喜庆气氛。她亲手做了小蛋糕，桌上还摆着一罐自制果酱。在这样一间詹姆斯一世风格的房间里喝顿乡村式下午茶，让菲利普觉得别有一番雅趣。阿西尔尼不知哪根筋搭错，忽然开始长篇大论地聊起拜占庭的历史来，他刚刚读完《罗马帝国衰亡史》的最后几章。他夸张地竖着食指，滔滔不绝地讲着狄奥多拉和艾琳的秘闻艳史，把跟前的小伙子听得一愣一愣的。他吹得天花乱坠，唾沫星子乱飞，而那位年轻的小伙子一言不发，满脸通红，不时点点头以表自己很感兴趣。阿西尔尼夫人才不管他说了些什么呢，她时而打断他，给小伙子倒满茶，或者催他再吃一块果酱蛋糕。菲利普看着萨莉，她坐在一旁，眼帘低垂，轻悄悄、静幽幽，一副若有所思的样子，长长的睫毛在脸上投下浅浅的暗影。你看不出这个女孩究竟是觉得此情此景非常可笑，还是在心里偷偷喜欢那个年轻小伙。她像是一个谜。但有一件事可以确定：这位电气工程师相貌英俊，一表人才，胡子刮得干净，五官端正老实。他个子很高，身材壮实。菲利普不禁觉得他配萨莉真是太合适了。想到这两人将来会有的幸福生活，他心里好生嫉妒。">查看中文翻译</div>
