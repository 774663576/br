<div class="line_en">"Mr. President, Mrs. Obama," he said. "We thought you and the girls might like a little change of pace, and so we've arranged a petting zoo for you." He smiled broadly at us. "Never before has a First Family participated in something like this."</div>

<div class="line_en">One spring morning, Barack and the girls and I were summoned downstairs from the residence to the South Lawn. A man I'd never seen before stood waiting for us in the driveway. He had a friendly face and a salt-and-pepper mustache that gave him an air of dignity. He introduced himself as Lloyd.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个春天的早晨，我和贝拉克，还有两个女儿被从楼上的住所召集到了楼下的南草坪。在那儿，我们见到了一位之前从来没见过的先生，他站在车道上等我们，面容友好亲切，还蓄着一绺花白的山羊胡，这让他看上去多了一分威严神气。他自我介绍说他叫劳埃德。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The man gestured to his left and we looked. About thirty yards away, lounging in the shade of the cedar trees, were four big, beautiful cats. There was a lion, a tiger, a sleek black panther, and a slender, spotted cheetah. From where I stood, I could see no fences or chains. There seemed to be nothing penning them in. It all felt odd to me. Most certainly a change of pace.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他指向他的左边，我们顺着他指的方向看去，距离我们大约30码的地方，在雪松树荫处，四只又大又漂亮的猫科动物正悠闲地走来走去—一头狮子、一只老虎、一只皮毛光洁的黑色美洲豹、一只修长的带斑点的猎豹。从我站的地方看去，看不到任何围栏或链子，看来并没有任何东西围着它们。这一切都让我感到新奇无比，真的是能让我们换换口味。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I panicked, grabbing Sasha by the arm, sprinting with her back up the lawn toward the house, trusting that Barack and Malia were doing the same. Judging from the noise, I could tell that all the animals had leaped to their feet and were now coming after us.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我感到一阵恐慌，紧紧抓起萨沙的胳膊，猛地转身带着她顺着草坪向我们的房子冲去，我相信贝拉克此时也带着玛利亚做出了同样的反应。从我们身后传来的声音我判断：四只动物都已经跃起，紧追我们而来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, yes, of course, we thought about that," Lloyd said. "We figured your family would enjoy the animals more if they were roaming free, like they would in the wild. So we've sedated them for your safety. They're no harm to you." He gave a reassuring wave. "Go ahead, get closer. Enjoy!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，就是这样，您说的这一点我们当然考虑过。”劳埃德回答我说，“我们想着您和您的家人可能更喜欢能够自由自在活动的动物，就像它们生活在野外一样。但是为了你们的安全，我们已经给它们注射了镇静剂，它们现在是不会伤害你们的。”说完，他又做了一个手势，告诉我们完全可以放心，然后又说：“去吧，靠近点，和它们好好玩玩。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Barack and I took Malia's and Sasha's hands and made our way across the still-dewy grass of the South Lawn. The animals were larger than I expected, languid and sinewy, their tails flicking as they monitored our approach. I'd never seen anything like it, four cats in a companionable line. The lion stirred slightly as we drew closer. I saw the panther's eyes tracking us, the tiger's ears flattening just a little. Then, without warning, the cheetah shot out from the shade with blinding speed, rocketing right at us.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="贝拉克和我牵起玛利亚和萨沙的手，我们穿过南草坪还带着露水的草地，朝那几只动物走去。它们比我们预期的还要大，虽然看上去有点儿倦怠但都非常强壮。觉察到我们靠近时，它们的尾巴开始摆动。我还从来没见到过这样的情景，四只猫科动物像朋友一样和谐地待在一起。我们继续靠近的时候，狮子开始有所反应，美洲豹用眼睛紧紧盯着我们，老虎的耳朵稍微向下收起贴近头部。然后，没有任何的预兆，那只猎豹突然发出一声嚎叫，以闪电般的速度像火箭似的从树荫处冲向我们。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Icontinued to feel as if we were falling backward, our whole family in a giant trust fall. I had confidence in the apparatus that had been set up to support us in the White House, but still I could feel vulnerable, knowing that everything from the safety of our daughters to the orchestration of my movements lay almost entirely in the hands of other people -- many of them at least twenty years younger than I was. Growing up on Euclid Avenue, I'd been taught that self-sufficiency was everything. I'd been raised to handle my own business, but now that seemed almost impossible. Things got handled for me. Before I traveled, staffers drove the routes I'd take to venues, timing my transit down to the minute, scheduling my bathroom breaks in advance. Agents took my girls to playdates. Housekeepers collected our dirty laundry. I no longer drove a car or carried things like cash or house keys. Aides took phone calls, attended meetings, and drafted statements on my behalf.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我一直觉得我们在原地踏步，甚至不进反退，我们一家人仿佛在经历一场巨型背摔游戏，虽然我对白宫早已建立起来的用以支持我们的体系充满信心，但我依然觉得这一切都非常脆弱，我似乎觉得每一件事情，从孩子们的安全到我的日常活动安排全都掌握在别人的手中—他们中很多人甚至比我要年轻二十岁以上。在欧几里得大道的成长经验告诉我：自给自足极为重要，绝不能依赖他人。我也从小就习惯了自己的事情自己处理，但是当时，那完全不可能，我所有的事情似乎都有人帮我处理。在我准备外出之前，工作人员会亲自提前开车去一趟活动地点，并将我的现场活动时间精确计算到每一分钟，提前安排好我上洗手间的时间以及休息的时间。有专门的特工负责带孩子们出去约会玩耍，有专门的保洁人员负责收集我们的脏衣服并清洗干净，我也不用自己开车，或者想着带现金、钥匙之类的事情。同时，我还有助理帮我接听电话、参加会议、代我起草文案等。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">All of this was marvelous and helpful, freeing me up to focus on the things I felt were most important. But occasionally it left me -- a detail person -- feeling as if I'd lost control of the details. Which is when the lions and cheetahs started to lurk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所有这一切看起来都棒极了，于我来说大有好处，具体来说，就是让我从琐事中得以解脱，可以集中精力去做我认为更重要的事情。但是，对我这样一个注重细节的人来说，我感觉这让自己失去了对所有细节的控制。正因为如此，我的潜意识里才会出现先前梦境中的狮子和猎豹，这让我倍感无力。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Everything was big and everything was relevant. I read a set of news clips sent by my staff each morning and knew that Barack would be obliged to absorb and respond to every new development. He'd be blamed for things he couldn't control, pushed to solve frightening problems in faraway nations, expected to plug a hole at the bottom of the ocean. His job, it seemed, was to take the chaos and metabolize it somehow into calm leadership -- every day of the week, every week of the year.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was also much that couldn't be planned for, a larger unruliness that paced the borders of our every day. When you're married to the president, you come to understand quickly that the world brims with chaos, that disasters unfurl without notice. Forces seen and unseen stand ready to tear into whatever calm you might feel. The news could never be ignored: An earthquake devastates Haiti. A gasket blows five thousand feet underwater beneath an oil rig off the coast of Louisiana, sending millions of barrels of crude oil gushing into the Gulf of Mexico. Revolution stirs in Egypt. A gunman opens fire in the parking lot of an Arizona supermarket, killing six people and maiming a U. S. congresswoman.</div>

<div class="line_en">When one or both of us traveled somewhere in the wake of a tragedy, it was often to remind Americans not to look too quickly past the pain of others. When I could, I tried to highlight the efforts of relief workers, educators, or community volunteers -- anyone who gave more when things got rough. Traveling to Haiti with Jill Biden three months after the 2010 earthquake there, I felt my heart catch, seeing pyramids of rubble where homes had once been, sites where tens of thousands of people -- mothers, grandfathers, babies -- had been buried alive. We visited a set of converted buses where local artists were doing art therapy with displaced children who, despite their losses and thanks to the adults around them, still bubbled with hope.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果一场灾难刚刚发生，我们俩其中一人或者我们俩共同前往那里，那就是想提醒所有美国人，永远不要太快忘记别人的伤痛。如果条件允许，我经常会再三强调，要感激那些救灾人员、教育者、社区志愿者以及任何愿意在灾难面前伸出援手的人。2010年，在海地遭遇地震袭击后三个月，我和吉尔·拜登去那里访问。当我看到人们曾经的家园变成了一堆一堆的废墟，看到数以万计的人民—母亲、祖父、孩子—曾经活生生地被埋葬的现场，我感到无比揪心。我们参观了一组改装过的公共汽车，当地的艺术家正在那儿对无家可归的孩子进行艺术治疗。这些孩子虽然在灾难中失去了很多很多，但因为有周围这些热心的成年人关怀，他们内心依旧充满了希望。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I tried as best I could not to let the roiling uncertainties of the world impact my day-to-day work as First Lady, but sometimes there was no getting around it. How Barack and I comported ourselves in the face of instability mattered. We understood that we represented the nation and were obligated to step forward and be present when there was tragedy, or hardship, or confusion. Part of our role, as we understood it, was to model reason, compassion, and consistency. After the BP oil spill -- the worst in U. S. history -- had finally been contained, many Americans were still rattled, unwilling to believe it was safe to return to the Gulf of Mexico for vacation, causing local economies to suffer. So we made a family trip to Florida, during which Barack took Sasha for a swim, releasing a photo to the media that showed the two of them splashing happily in the surf. It was a small gesture, but the message was bigger: If he trusts the water, then so can you.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="作为第一夫人，我一直尽全力不让自己的日常工作受到外界的影响。具体来说，就是不受这动荡的世界里种种不确定因素的影响，但是，有时候，你根本无法回避。在面对一些不确定的事情时，我始终要和贝拉克保持一致，这一点非常重要。我们能够理解，我们代表着整个国家，在悲剧、灾难或者混乱发生的时候，我们有义务挺身而出，并始终冲在前面。其实，作为总统和第一夫人，我们的一部分角色就是要为全国公众做出表率，向他们展示我们时刻都保持理性、拥有同情心并言行一致。虽然英国石油公司原油泄露事件—这是美国历史上遇到的最严重的一次生态危机—最后终于得到有效控制，但一些美国人仍然感到慌乱，不愿意相信去墨西哥湾度假是安全的，致使当地经济承受巨大压力。因此，我们一家人特地安排了一次前往佛罗里达州的旅行。其间，贝拉克带着萨沙去水里游泳，并拍照发布在了媒体上。照片中，他们父女二人在浪花中开心地打水仗。虽然这只是一个非常小的姿态，但传递出的信息却是巨大的：如果美国总统都相信那里的水质是安全的，那么你也完全可以相信。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Walter Reed tended to be the second or third stop for injured service members who were evacuated out of Iraq and Afghanistan. Many were triaged in the war zone and then treated at a military medical facility in Landstuhl, Germany, before being flown to the United States. Some troops stayed only a few days at Walter Reed. Others were there for months. The hospital employed top-notch military surgeons and offered excellent rehabilitation services, geared to handle the most devastating of battlefield injuries. Thanks to modern developments in armor, American service members were now surviving bomb blasts that would once have killed them. That was the good news. The bad news was that nearly a decade into two conflicts characterized by surprise attacks and hidden explosive devices, those injuries were plentiful and grave.</div>

<div class="line_en">As much as I tried to prepare for everything in life, there was no preparing for the interactions I had at military hospitals and Fisher Houses -- lodgings where, thanks to a charitable organization of the same name, military families could stay for free while tending to an injured loved one. As I've said before, I grew up knowing little about the military. My father had spent two years in the Army, but well before I was born. Until Barack started campaigning, I'd had no exposure to the orderly bustle of an Army base or the modest tract homes that housed service members with families. War, for me, had always been terrifying but also abstract, involving landscapes I couldn't imagine and people I didn't know. To view it this way, I see now, had been a luxury.</div>

<div class="line_en">When I arrived at a hospital, I was usually met by a charge nurse, handed a set of medical scrubs to wear, and instructed to sanitize my hands each time I entered a room. Before opening a new door, I'd get a quick briefing on the service member and his or her situation. Each patient, too, was asked in advance whether he or she would like a visit from me. A few would decline, possibly because they weren't feeling well enough or maybe for political reasons. Either way, I understood. The last thing I wanted to be was a burden.</div>

<div class="line_en">This was resilience. It was reflective of a larger spirit of self-sufficiency and pride I'd seen in all parts of the military. I sat one day with a man who'd gone off young and healthy to an overseas deployment, leaving behind a pregnant wife, and had come back quadriplegic, unable to move his arms or legs. As we talked, their baby -- a tiny newborn with a pink face -- lay swaddled in a blanket on his chest. I met another service member who'd had a leg amputated and asked me a lot of questions about the Secret Service. He explained cheerily that he'd once hoped to become an agent after leaving the military, but that given the injury he was now figuring out a new plan.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then there were the families. I introduced myself to the wives and husbands, mothers and fathers, cousins and friends I found by the bedside, people who had often put the rest of their lives on hold in order to stay close. Sometimes they were the only ones I could talk to, as their loved one lay immobilized nearby, heavily sedated or asleep. These family members carried their own weight. Some came from generations of military service, while others were teenage girlfriends who'd become brides just ahead of a deployment -- their futures now having taken a sudden, complicated turn. I can no longer count the number of mothers with whom I've cried, their distress so acute that all we could do was lace our hands together and pray silently through tears.</div>

He had access to all manner of top secret information, and as far as I was concerned, most especially on matters of national security, he needed no input from me.

<div class="line_en">Barack, who's always been good at compartmentalizing, managed to be admirably present and undistracted when he was with us. It was something we'd learned together over time as our work lives had grown increasingly busy and intense. Fences needed to go up; boundaries required protecting. Bin Laden was not invited to dinner, nor was the humanitarian crisis in Libya, nor were the Tea Party Republicans. We had kids, and kids need room to speak and grow. Our family time was when big worries and urgent concerns got abruptly and mercilessly shrunk to nothing so that the small could rightly take over. Barack and I would sit at dinner, hearing tales from the Sidwell playground or listening to the details of Malia's research project on endangered animals, feeling as if these were the most important things in the world. Because they were. They deserved to be.</div>

<div class="line_en">Most important, over the course of 2010, I'd worked hard to help push a new child nutrition bill through Congress, expanding children's access to healthy, high-quality food in public schools and increasing the reimbursement rate for federally subsidized meals for the first time in thirty years. As much as I was generally happy to stay out of politics and policy making, this had been my big fight -- the issue for which I was willing to hurl myself into the ring. I'd spent hours making calls to senators and representatives, trying to convince them that our children deserved better than what they were getting. I'd talked about it endlessly with Barack, his advisers, anyone who would listen. The new law added more fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and low-fat dairy to roughly forty-three million meals served daily. It regulated the junk food that got sold to children via vending machines on school property while also giving funding to schools to establish gardens and use locally grown produce. For me, it was a straightforward good thing -- a potent, ground-level way to address childhood obesity.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="更重要的是，整个2010年，我都在努力帮助贝拉克的政府推动一项新的儿童营养法案，以期通过国会审议，从而确保孩子们在公立学校能够享受健康、高质量的食品，同时提高联邦资助餐的补偿比例，这一做法是近三十年来的第一次。通常情况下，我不愿意涉足白宫西翼的政治，更不愿参与政策制定，但是，这次情况不同，这对我来说就是一场大决战，因此，我破例将自己投入进去。我花了数小时专门给参议院和众议院的议员打电话，试图说服他们，让他们相信我们的孩子值得享用更好的食品。我跟贝拉克、他的顾问，以及任何感兴趣、愿意听我说的人无休止地谈论这一问题。新法案规定，在每天供应的大约四千三百万份学校午餐中，应该增加更多的新鲜水果和蔬菜、全谷物，以及低脂乳品。法案限制通过学校的自动售货机向孩子们售卖垃圾食品，同时，同意资助学校建造菜园并使用当地自然生长的产品。对我来说，这一法案如果能通过将是一桩好事—一个能够帮助解决儿童肥胖问题的非常有效而且接地气的方法。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A year after launching Let's Move!, we were seeing results. We'd aligned ourselves with different foundations and food suppliers to install six thousand salad bars in school cafeterias and were recruiting local chefs to help schools serve meals that were not just healthy but tasty. Walmart, which was then the nation's largest grocery retailer, had joined our effort by pledging to cut the amount of sugar, salt, and fat in its food products and to reduce prices on produce. And we'd enlisted mayors from five hundred cities and towns across the country to commit to tackling childhood obesity on the local level.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在我发布“让我们行动起来”的运动一年后，我们终于看到了成果。我们和不同的基金会、食品供应商结盟，在学校餐厅开设了六千个沙拉吧，聘请当地厨师帮助学校提供膳食，这些食物不仅健康而且美味。当时美国最大的食品零售商沃尔玛也加入了我们的运动，承诺要和我们一起努力，减少它所提供的食品中的糖分、盐分和脂肪含量，同时降低农产品价格。我们也争取到了全国五百个城镇的市长、镇长的支持，他们都承诺要在当地想方设法应对儿童肥胖问题。">查看中文翻译</div>

And I was now also focused on getting a new effort called Joining Forces off the ground -- this one in collaboration with Jill Biden, whose son Beau had recently returned safely from his deployment in Iraq.

Barack had kicked things off earlier in the year with a government-wide audit, asking each agency to find new ways to support military families. I, meanwhile, reached out to the country's most powerful CEOs, generating commitments to hire a significant number of veterans and military spouses. Jill would garner pledges from colleges and universities to train teachers and professors to better understand the needs of military children. We also wanted to fight the stigma surrounding the mental health issues that followed some of our troops home, and planned to lobby writers and producers in Hollywood to include military stories in their movies and TV shows.</div>

<div class="line_en">The issues I was working on weren't simple, but still they were manageable in ways that much of what kept my husband at his desk at night was not. As had been the case since I first met him, nighttime was when Barack's mind traveled without distraction. It was during these quiet hours that he could find perspective or inhale new information, adding data points to the vast mental map he carried around. Ushers often came to the Treaty Room a few times over the course of an evening to deliver more folders, containing more papers, freshly generated by staffers who were working late in the offices downstairs. If Barack got hungry, a valet would bring him a small dish of figs or nuts. He was no longer smoking, thankfully, though he'd often chew a piece of nicotine gum. Most nights of the week, he stayed at his desk until 1:00 or 2:00 in the morning, reading memos, rewriting speeches, and responding to email while ESPN played low on the TV. He always took a break to come kiss me and the girls good night.</div>

<div class="line_en">The last bit of work he did, usually at some hour past midnight, was to read letters from American citizens. Since the start of his presidency, Barack had asked his correspondence staff to include ten letters or messages from constituents inside his briefing book, selected from the roughly fifteen thousand letters and emails that poured in daily. He read each one carefully, jotting responses in the margins so that a staffer could prepare a reply or forward a concern on to a cabinet secretary. He read letters from soldiers. From prison inmates. From cancer patients struggling to pay health-care premiums and from people who'd lost their homes to foreclosure. From gay people who hoped to be able to legally marry and from Republicans who felt he was ruining the country. From moms, grandfathers, and young children.

<div class="line_en">For me, there was nothing more gratifying than being a bystander in these moments, to sit barely noticed by the people around me and witness the miracle of a girl -- our girl -- growing independent and whole. We had thrust our daughters into all the strangeness and intensity of White House life, not knowing how it would impact them or what they'd take from the experience. I tried to make our daughters' exposure to the wider world as positive as possible, realizing that Barack and I had a unique opportunity to show them history up close. When Barack had foreign trips that coincided with school vacations, we traveled as a family, knowing it would be educational. In the summer of 2009, we'd brought them on a trip that included visits to the Kremlin in Moscow and the Vatican in Rome. In the span of seven days, they'd met the Russian president, toured the Pantheon and the Roman Colosseum, and passed through the "Door of No Return" in Ghana, the departure point for untold numbers of Africans who'd been sold into slavery.</div>

<div class="line_en">Over the course of the winter of 2011, we'd been hearing news that the reality-show host and New York real-estate developer Donald Trump was beginning to make noise about possibly running for the Republican presidential nomination when Barack came up for reelection in 2012. Mostly, though, it seemed he was just making noise in general, surfacing on cable shows to offer yammering, inexpert critiques of Barack's foreign policy decisions and openly questioning whether he was an American citizen. The so-called birthers had tried during the previous campaign to feed a conspiracy theory claiming that Barack's Hawaiian birth certificate was somehow a hoax and that he'd in fact been born in Kenya. Trump was now actively working to revive the argument, making increasingly outlandish claims on television, insisting that the 1961 Honolulu newspaper announcements of Barack's birth were fraudulent and that none of his kindergarten classmates remembered him. All the while, in their quest for clicks and ratings, news outlets -- particularly the more conservative ones -- were gleefully pumping oxygen into his groundless claims.</div>

The people who tried to define us as "other" had been doing so for years already. We did everything we could to rise above their lies and distortions, trusting that the way Barack and I lived our lives would show people the truth about who we really were. I'd lived with earnest and well-intentioned concerns for our safety since almost the day Barack first decided to run for president. "We're praying nobody hurts you," people used to say, clasping my hand at campaign events.

<div class="line_en">I kept their words with me. I felt the protection of those millions of decent people who prayed for our safety. Barack and I both relied on our personal faith as well. We went to church only rarely now, mostly because it had become such a spectacle, involving reporters shouting questions as we walked in to worship. Ever since the scrutiny of the Reverend Jeremiah Wright had become an issue in Barack's first presidential campaign, ever since opponents had tried to use faith as a weapon -- suggesting that Barack was a "secret Muslim"-- we'd made the choice to exercise our faith privately and at home, including praying each night before dinner and organizing a few sessions of Sunday school at the White House for our daughters. We didn't join a church in Washington, because we didn't want to subject another congregation to the kind of bad-faith attacks that had rained down on Trinity, our church in Chicago. It was a sacrifice, though. I missed the warmth of a spiritual community. Every night, I'd look over and see Barack lying with his eyes closed on the other side of the bed, quietly saying his prayers.</div>

<div class="line_en">Months after the birther rumors picked up steam, on a Friday night in November, a man parked his car on a closed part of Constitution Avenue and started firing a semiautomatic rifle out the window, aimed at the top floors of the White House. A bullet hit one of the windows in the Yellow Oval Room, where I sometimes liked to sit and have tea. Another lodged itself in a window frame, and more ricocheted off the roof. Barack and I were out that night, as was Malia, but Sasha and my mom were both at home, though unaware and unharmed.

<div class="line_en">Every challenge, of course, is relative. I knew my kids were growing up with more advantages and more abundance than most families could ever begin to imagine having. Our girls had a beautiful home, food on the table, devoted adults around them, and nothing but encouragement and resources when it came to getting an education. I put everything I had into Malia and Sasha and their development, but as First Lady I was mindful, too, of a larger obligation. I felt that I owed more to children in general, and in particular to girls. Some of this was spawned by the response people tended to have to my life story -- the surprise that an urban black girl had vaulted through Ivy League schools and executive jobs and landed in the White House. I understood that my trajectory was unusual, but there was no good reason why it had to be. There had been so many times in my life when I'd found myself the only woman of color -- or even the only woman, period -- sitting at a conference table or attending a board meeting or mingling at one VIP gathering or another. If I was the first at some of these things, I wanted to make sure that in the end I wasn't the only -- that others were coming up behind me. As my mother, the plainspoken enemy of all hyperbole, still says anytime someone starts gushing about me and Craig and our various accomplishments, "They're not special at all.

<div class="line_en">With this in mind, I'd started a leadership and mentoring program at the White House, inviting twenty sophomore and junior girls from high schools around Greater D. C. to join us for monthly get-togethers that included informal chats, field trips, and sessions on things like financial literacy and choosing a career. We kept the program largely behind closed doors, rather than thrusting these girls into the media fray.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正是抱着这样的想法，我在白宫开启了一项领导力与导师辅导计划，邀请了华盛顿地区二十名刚上高二、高三的女孩每月跟我们相聚一次并参加我们的活动，比如非正式的聊天、实地考察旅行、金融知识普及、择业探讨等。我们所开展的这些活动都是私下进行，不会让孩子们暴露在媒体的聚光灯之下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We paired each teen with a female mentor who would foster a personal relationship with her, sharing her resources and her life story. Valerie was a mentor. Cris Comerford, the White House's first female executive chef, was a mentor. Jill Biden was, too, as were a number of senior women from both the East and the West Wing staffs. The students were nominated by their principals or guidance counselors and would stay with us until they graduated. We had girls from military families, girls from immigrant families, a teen mom, a girl who'd lived in a homeless shelter. They were smart, curious young women, all of them. No different from me. No different from my daughters. I watched over time as the girls formed friendships, finding a rapport with one another and with the adults around them. I spent hours talking with them in a big circle, munching popcorn and trading our thoughts about college applications, body image, and boys. No topic was off-limits. We ended up laughing a lot. More than anything, I hoped this was what they'd carry forward into the future -- the ease, the sense of community, the encouragement to speak and be heard.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们为每一名孩子配了一名女性导师，导师可以跟自己的学生建立私人关系，跟孩子们分享她所拥有的资源以及她的人生故事。其中有一位导师名叫瓦莱丽，还有一位叫克里斯·科莫福德，她是白宫第一位女性主厨。吉尔·拜登也是其中一位导师。此外，白宫东翼和西翼很多资历深厚的女性职员也都加入进来，成为她们的导师。这些学生都是通过他们的校长或者专职指导顾问推荐过来的，在毕业之前，她们都会来参加我们的活动。这些孩子有的来自军人家庭，有的来自移民家庭，有一位是少女妈妈，还有一名曾经生活在收容所里。但是，不管她们是什么背景，她们都非常聪明，都有着强烈的好奇心。在我看来，她们与我没有什么不同，与我的两个女儿也没有什么不同。随着时间的推移，我眼看着她们之间建立起深厚的友谊，看着她们彼此之间、她们与周围的成年人之间建立起非常密切的关系。我常常跟她们围成一圈坐着聊天，一聊就是好几个小时，我们一边吃着爆米花，一边就申请大学、保持身材以及交男朋友等话题交换我们的想法。在我们这里，没有不能谈论的话题，我们经常聊着聊着就哈哈大笑。她们在这里感受到的放松、归属感以及对诉说与倾听的鼓励，都是我最希望她们能够保留下来的，我希望她们能将这些带到她们未来的人生当中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We'd lived inside the bubble of the presidency for more than two years now. I looked for ways to widen its perimeter as I could. Barack and I continued to open the White House up to more people, most especially children, hoping to make its grandeur feel inclusive, mixing some liveliness into the formality and tradition. Anytime foreign dignitaries came for state visits, we invited local schoolkids to come over to take in the pomp of an official welcome ceremony and taste the food that would be served at the state dinner. When musicians were coming for an evening performance, we asked them to show up early to help with a youth workshop. We wanted to highlight the importance of exposing children to the arts, showing that it's not a luxury but a necessity to their overall educational experience. I relished the sight of high schoolers mingling with contemporary artists like John Legend, Justin Timberlake, and Alison Krauss as well as legends like Smokey Robinson and Patti LaBelle. For me, it was a throwback to the way I'd been raised -- the jazz at Southside's house, the piano recitals and Operetta Workshops put on by my great-aunt Robbie, my family's trips to downtown museums. I knew how arts and culture contributed to the development of a child. And it made me feel at home. Barack and I swayed to the beat together in the front row of every performance. Even my mother, who generally steered clear of public appearances, always made her way down to the state floor anytime music was playing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到那时为止，我们已经在总统这一职位所形成的气泡中生活了两年。这期间，我一直在竭尽所能地寻找各种方法，来扩大这个气泡的边界。我和贝拉克一如既往，尽可能地让更多人走进白宫，尤其是孩子们，我们希望他们在看到白宫宏伟壮丽的同时，也能够感受到它的包容；在看到白宫的传统与礼节的同时，也能感受到它的活泼生动。每当有外国政要因国事访问来到白宫时，我们都会邀请当地小学的孩子们来白宫一起加入隆重盛大的官方欢迎仪式中，并一同品尝国宴上的食物。当有音乐家来白宫进行夜场演出时，我们会请他们早一点儿过来，到我们的青年研讨会来帮忙。我们想告诉大家：艺术对孩子们的成长至关重要，它并不是一种奢侈的体验，而是孩子们整体教育经历中必不可少的一部分。我期望看到我们的高中生与当代知名艺术家，如约翰·传奇 [5]、贾斯汀·汀布莱克 [6]、艾莉森·克劳斯 [7]以及史摩基·罗宾逊 [8]、帕蒂·拉贝尔 [9]等传奇人物之间的交往。对我来说，我们为孩子们所做的这一切犹如回到了我小时候的成长路径—芝加哥南城的屋子里爵士乐不断，姑婆萝比经常进行钢琴独奏并主办轻歌剧讲习班，我们一家人经常去市中心博物馆参观。我深知文化和艺术的熏陶在一个孩子成长过程中的重要作用，而且就我个人来说，沉浸在艺术和文化的氛围中让我觉得轻松自在。每次演出的时候，我都和贝拉克站在前排，随着艺术家们的演奏不由自主地摇晃着身体，就连我的母亲—从不愿在公开场合露面的她，每当听到音乐声响起，也会马上下楼加入我们当中。【注：[5]约翰·传奇（John Legend，1978—），原名约翰·史提芬斯（John Stephens），是一位九次夺得格莱美奖的R&amp;B创作型歌手和钢琴师。[6]贾斯汀·汀布莱克（Justin Timberlake，1981—），美国男歌手、演员、音乐制作人、主持人，前男子演唱组合超级男孩成员，曾获十座格莱美奖、三十个格莱美提名、四座艾美奖。[7]艾莉森·克劳斯（Alison Krauss，1971—），美国著名歌手，是当今美国蓝草音乐的领军人物。[8]史摩基 ·罗宾逊（Smokey Robinson，1940—），演员、歌手、音乐制作人，参演过《最后的假日》《好莱坞重案组》《最后的假期》等影片，获得2015年黑人娱乐电视奖终身成就奖。民谣歌手鲍勃·迪伦曾评价他为“美国活着的最伟大的诗人”。[9]帕蒂 ·拉贝尔（Patti LaBelle，1940—），是活跃于20世纪七八十年代的灵魂乐歌手，她的嗓音清澈、高亢，有着金属般的光泽。1973年，她成为第一个登上纽约大都会歌剧院的非洲裔美国歌手。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In any given day, we were exposed to so much. Glamour, excellence, devastation, hope. Everything lived side by side, and all the while we had two kids trying to lead their own lives apart from what was going on at home. I did what I could to keep myself and the girls integrated into the everyday world. My goal was what it had always been -- to find normalcy where I could, to fit myself back into pockets of regular life. During soccer and lacrosse seasons, I went to many of Sasha's and Malia's home games, taking my place on the sidelines alongside other parents, politely turning down anyone who asked to take a photo, though I was always happy to make small talk. After Malia started tennis, I mostly watched her matches through the window of a Secret Service vehicle parked discreetly near the courts, not wanting to create a distraction. Only when it was over would I emerge to give her a hug.</div>

<div class="line_en">We also added celebrations of dance and other arts to the mix, bringing in emerging artists to showcase new work. In 2009, we'd put on the first-ever White House poetry and spoken-word event, listening as a young composer named Lin-Manuel Miranda stood up and astonished everyone with a piece from a project he was just beginning to put together, describing it as a "concept album about the life of someone I think embodies hip-hop… Treasury secretary Alexander Hamilton."</div>

<div class="line_en">With Barack, we'd all but given up on normalcy or there being any sense of lightness in his movements. He attended school functions and the girls' sporting events as he could, but his opportunities to mingle were limited, and the presence of his security detail was never subtle. The point, in fact, was to be unsubtle -- to send a clear message to the world that nobody could harm the president of the United States. For obvious reasons, I was glad for this. But juxtaposed against the norms of family life, it could be a little much.</div>

Following our early negotiations with the Secret Service, Sasha and Malia were doing things like going to friends' bat mitzvahs, washing cars for the school fund-raiser, and even hanging out at the mall, always with agents and often with my mom tagging along, but they were now at least as mobile as their peers. Sasha's agents, including Beth Celestini and Lawrence Tucker -- whom everyone called L. T.-- had become beloved fixtures at Sidwell. Kids begged L. T. to push them on the swing set during recess. Families often sent in extra cupcakes for the agents when there were classroom birthday celebrations.</div>

"Stone-faced softies," I used to call them, teasingly. Over all the hours we spent together and many miles traveled, we became real friends.

<div class="line_en">Anytime I went somewhere without a fuss, it felt like a small victory, an exercise of free will. I was a detail person, after all. I hadn't forgotten how gratifying it could be to tick through the minutiae of a shopping list. Maybe six months after the PetSmart trip, I made a giddy incognito run to the local Target, dressed in a baseball cap and sunglasses. My security detail wore shorts and sneakers and ditched their earpieces, doing their best not to stand out as they trailed me and my assistant Kristin Jones through the store. We wandered every single aisle. I selected some Oil of Olay face cream and new toothbrushes. We got dryer sheets and laundry detergent for Kristin, and I found a couple of games for Sasha and Malia. And for the first time in several years, I was able to pick out a card to give to Barack on our anniversary.</div>

<div class="line_en">Like my daughters, I was cultivating a private life to go along with my official one. I'd found there were ways to keep a low profile when I needed to, helped by the Secret Service's willingness to be flexible. Rather than riding in a motorcade, I was sometimes allowed to travel in an unmarked van and with a lighter security escort. I managed to make lightning-strike shopping trips from time to time, coming and going from a place before anyone really registered I was there. After Bo expertly disemboweled or shredded every last dog toy bought for him by the staff who did our regular shopping, I personally escorted him over to PetSmart in Alexandria one morning.

<div class="line_en">As time went by, I added new adventures to my routine. I started to meet friends occasionally out for dinner in restaurants or at their homes. Sometimes I'd go to a park and take long walks along the Potomac River. I'd have agents walking ahead of and behind me on these excursions, but inconspicuously and at a distance. In later years, I'd begin leaving the White House to hit workout classes, dropping in on SoulCycle and Solidcore studios around the city, slipping into the room at the last minute and leaving as soon as class was done to avoid causing a disturbance. The most liberating activity of all turned out to be downhill skiing, a sport with which I had little experience but that quickly became a passion. Capitalizing on the unusually heavy winters we'd had during our first two years in Washington, I made a few day trips with the girls and some friends to a tiny, aptly named ski area called Liberty Mountain, near Gettysburg, where we found we could don helmets, scarves, and goggles and blend into any crowd.

I knit my old life into my new one, my private concerns into my public work. In D. C., I'd made a handful of new friends -- a couple of the mothers of Sasha's and Malia's classmates and a few people I'd met in the course of White House duties. These were women who cared less about my last name or home address and more about who I was as a person. It's funny how quickly you can tell who's there for you and who's just trying to plant some sort of flag.

These were the friends who'd held me together, dropping off groceries when I was too busy to shop, picking up the girls for ballet when I was behind on work or just needing a break. A number of them had hopped planes to join me for unglamorous stops on the campaign trail, giving me emotional ballast when I needed it most.

I started referring to these gatherings as "Boot Camp," in part because I did admittedly force everyone to work out with me several times a day (I also at one point tried to ban wine and snacks, though this got swiftly shot down) but more importantly because I like the idea of being rigorous about friendship.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="2011年的时候，我开始有意识地为我已经建立起来的友谊圈投资、再投资，让我昔日的朋友和新结交的朋友都聚在一起。每隔几个月，我都会邀请十二名我最亲密的朋友到戴维营和我一起过周末。戴维营是美国总统的夏季避暑胜地，坐落在马里兰州北部的群山之间，距离华盛顿大约六十英里，那里树木繁茂、风景如画。我将我们之间的聚会命名为“训练营”，部分原因是我确确实实逼迫每个人每天和我一起锻炼好几次（我一度还试图禁止大家喝酒、吃糖果，但是这种尝试很快就被推翻了），但还有一个最重要的原因，那就是：在我看来，对待友谊一定要认真才行。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My friends tend to be accomplished, overcommitted people, many of them with busy family lives and heavy-duty jobs. I understood it wasn't always easy for them to get away. But this was part of the point. We were all so used to sacrificing for our kids, our spouses, and our work. I had learned through my years of trying to find balance in my life that it was okay to flip those priorities and care only for ourselves once in a while. I was more than happy to wave this banner on behalf of my friends, to create the reason -- and the power of a tradition -- for a whole bunch of women to turn to kids, spouses, and colleagues and say, Sorry, folks, I'm doing this for me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我的朋友们往往是那些有所成就又超负荷运转的人，她们中的很多人在应对忙碌的家庭生活的同时，还兼顾着繁重的工作任务。我能够理解她们，很多时候她们想要抽出身来并不容易。但是，这也正是我想说的其中一点。我们这些人都太习惯于为了我们的孩子、我们的另一半儿以及我们的工作而牺牲自己。多年来，我懂得了要在生活中寻找平衡，时不时地可以放下手头那些所谓的头等大事，而一心一意关注我们自己。我非常愿意代表女性朋友们举起这面旗帜，以寻找理由和一种传统的力量，使她们能够转身对自己的孩子、配偶、同事说：抱歉，亲爱的，我想为自己而活。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Boot Camp weekends became a way for us to take shelter, connect, and recharge. We stayed in cozy, wood-paneled cabins surrounded by forest, buzzed around in golf carts, and rode bikes. We played dodgeball and did burpees and downward dogs. I sometimes invited a few young staffers along, and it was trippy over the years to see Susan Sher, in her late sixties, spider crawling across the floor next to MacKenzie Smith, my twentysomething scheduler who'd been a collegiate soccer player. We ate healthy meals cooked by the White House chefs. We ran through drills overseen by my trainer, Cornell, and several baby-faced naval staffers who called us all "ma'am." We got a lot of exercise and talked and talked and talked. We pooled our thoughts and experiences, offering advice or funny stories or sometimes just the assurance that whoever was spilling her guts in a given moment wasn't the only one ever to have a teenager who was acting out or a boss she couldn't stand. Often, we steadied one another just by listening. And saying good-bye at the end of each weekend, we vowed we'd do it all again soon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们的周末“训练营”成了我和朋友们暂时寻求庇护、相互联络以及充电的一种途径。我们待在舒适的小木屋里，四周树木葱茏，我们坐着高尔夫球车到处跑来跑去，也会骑车出去兜风；我们会一起玩躲避球 [13]，做立卧撑跳，练习下犬式 [14]。有时候，我会邀请几位年轻的白宫职员和我们一起去，多年来，每当我看到快七十岁的苏珊·谢尔，与二十多岁的麦肯齐·史密斯并排在地上练习“蜘蛛爬”时，我总以为自己是产生了幻觉。麦肯齐平时负责我的日程安排，她大学时曾是一名足球运动员。在戴维营，我们的伙食是由白宫大厨亲自烹饪的，非常健康。我们会在我的健身教练康奈尔以及几个长着娃娃脸、称呼我们为“夫人”的海军职员的监督下，完成健身锻炼。我们会做很多运动，还会一直聊天。我们会毫无保留地分享自己的想法、经历、有趣的故事，以及好的建议，有时候，我们或许就是为了告诉彼此，不论是谁，如果她的家里有一个行为出格的青少年，或者她曾经有一位完全难以忍受的老板，那么她并不是唯一的一个，这些都不是什么不能吐露的见不得人的事。通常情况下，我们都会认真倾听，通过倾听来鼓励彼此，好让我们更加淡定。周末要结束的时候，我们挥手告别，并承诺我们很快还会再来一次这样的活动。【注：[13]躲避球，起源于英国，并于1900年前后盛行于美国的一项传统体育项目。[14]下犬式，瑜伽体式之一。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On the first Sunday in May 2011, I went to dinner with two friends at a restaurant downtown, leaving Barack and my mother in charge of the girls at home. The weekend had seemed especially busy. Barack had been pulled into a flurry of briefings that afternoon, and we'd spent Saturday evening at the White House Correspondents' Dinner, where in his speech Barack made a few pointed jokes about Donald Trump's Celebrity Apprentice career and his birther theories. I couldn't see him from my seat, but Trump had been in attendance. During Barack's monologue, news cameras zeroed in on him, stone-faced and stewing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="2011年5月的第一个星期日，我约了两个朋友一起去市中心的一家餐厅吃晚餐，留了贝拉克和我母亲在家照看两个孩子。那是一个非常忙碌的周末，贝拉克当天下午有一堆的简报需要处理，而且就在前一天的晚上，我们刚刚出席了白宫记者晚宴，当时，贝拉克发表讲话的时候讲了几个特别有针对性的笑话，都是关于唐纳德·特朗普的真人秀节目《学徒》，以及他关于贝拉克出生地提出质疑的那套逻辑。当时，特朗普也在场，只是从我的座位上看不到他。那场演讲可以说是贝拉克的独角戏，当时有新闻媒体用摄像机拍到了特朗普，只见他板着脸，表情木然，看得出来非常不自在。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For us, Sunday nights tended to be quiet and free. The girls were usually tired after a weekend of sports and socializing. And Barack, if he was lucky, could sometimes squeeze in a daytime round of golf on the course at Andrews Air Force Base, which left him more relaxed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对我们一家人来说，星期日晚上一般都比较安静悠闲。两个孩子经过一个周末的运动和社交活动往往都累了。至于贝拉克，如果幸运的话，他有时候白天可以抽空去安德鲁斯空军基地打一场高尔夫球，这样他就能好好放松一下了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My friends made me whole, as they always have and always will. They gave me a lift anytime I felt down or frustrated or had less access to Barack. They grounded me when I felt the pressures of being judged, having everything from my choice of nail-polish color to the size of my hips dissected and discussed publicly. And they helped me ride out the big, unsettling waves that sometimes hit without notice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我的朋友们让我的人生更完整，她们一直以来都扮演着这样的角色，未来亦会如此。每当我感到沮丧、消沉或者与贝拉克之间产生隔阂的时候，她们都会拉我一把；当我因为别人的评论—从我选择的指甲油颜色到我臀部的大小—而倍感压力的时候，她们会毫无保留地支持我。而且，当我意外遇到一些重大的、令人心绪不宁的“狂风巨浪”时，也是因为她们的帮助，我才能渡过难关。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That night, after catching up with my friends, I arrived home around 10:00, greeted at the door by an usher, as I always was. Already, I could tell something was going on, sensing a different-from-normal level of activity on the ground floor of the White House. I asked the usher if he knew where the president was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天晚上，我和朋友吃完晚饭后回到家时，大约十点钟，如往常一样，接待员在大门口迎我进去。一进门，我就感觉好像发生了什么，似乎白宫的一层正在举行什么不同寻常的活动。于是我问那位接待员，是否知道总统此时在做什么。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This is how I realized that it had finally happened. I knew it was coming, but I hadn't known exactly how it would play out. I'd spent the last two days trying to act completely normal, pretending I didn't know that something dangerous and important was about to take place. After months of high-level intelligence gathering and weeks of meticulous preparation, after security briefings and risk assessments and a final tense decision, seven thousand miles from the White House and under cover of darkness, an elite team of U. S. Navy SEALs had stormed a mysterious compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, looking for Osama bin Laden.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在此时，我才意识到那件大事终于发生了。其实，我早就知道马上就会有结果，但是我并不清楚这一切究竟如何开始。在刚过去的两天里，我尽量表现得跟平时一样，假装自己并不知道马上会有非常重大、非常危险的事情要发生。经过好几个月的高级别情报收集工作以及好几周的周密部署，经过各类安全简报分析以及风险评估，贝拉克最后做出了一项重大决策：在一个漆黑的夜晚，在距离白宫大约七千英里的地方，美国海军海豹突击队第六分队突袭了“基地”组织位于巴基斯坦北部阿伯塔巴德的一处院落，搜寻恐怖分子头目奥萨马·本·拉登。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Barack was coming out of our bedroom as I walked down the hall in the residence. He was dressed in a suit and red tie and seemed thoroughly jacked up on adrenaline. He'd been carrying the pressure of this decision for months.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当我刚刚走到楼上住所的大厅时，贝拉克从我们的卧室里走了出来，他穿了一套西装，打着一条红色的领带，此时他似乎肾上腺素飙升。好几个月以来，贝拉克一直因为这一抓捕决策而倍感压力。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That night, there was no inside or outside, anyway. In cities across the country, people had taken to the streets, clearly drawn by an impulse to be close to others, linked not just by patriotism but by the communal grief that had been born on 9/11 and the years of worries that we'd be attacked again. I thought about every military base I'd ever visited, all those soldiers working to recover from their wounds, the many people who'd sent family members to a faraway place in the name of protecting our country, the thousands of children who'd lost a parent on that horrible, sad day. There was no restoring any one of those losses, I knew. Nobody's death would ever replace a life. I'm not sure anyone's death is reason to celebrate, ever. But what America got that night was a moment of release, a chance to feel its own resilience.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，那晚也没什么室内、室外之分了，全国各个城市的人们被一种冲动驱使，纷纷走出家门，走上街去，想要和其他人靠得更近一些。这是出于爱国之心，出于“9·11”事件给大家带来的共同的悲伤，也出于多年来提心吊胆生怕再次遭遇袭击的担忧，大家被紧紧地联系在一起，在那一刻都有着一种向彼此更加靠近一点儿的冲动。而我，则想到了我曾经走访过的所有军事基地，所有那些正在从伤痛中恢复的士兵，那些以保护整个美国的名义将自己的家人送往遥远地区服役的家庭，那些在“9·11”事件中失去了父母的孩子。我知道，即使本·拉登被击毙了，美国人所遭受的那些损失也不可能挽回了，没有任何一个人的死亡能够换回一个已经逝去的生命。我到现在也不确定，本·拉登的死是不是我们进行庆祝的理由。但是，有一点我明白：那天晚上，美国人暂时获得了一阵精神上的放松，获得了一个可以证明我们强大的抗逆力的机会。">查看中文翻译</div>
