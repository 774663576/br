<div class="line_en">But luckily, there was such disorder inside, with the adults trying to hurry the children through so as to clear the way for the passengers from the zeppelin, that no one was watching very carefully. Lyra slipped out of the anorak, the leggings, and the boots and bundled them up as small as she could before shoving through the crowded corridors to her dormitory.</div>

<div class="line_en">Lyra ducked her head at once under the shelter of her wolverine hood, and shuffled in through the double doors with the other children.

<div class="line_en">Quickly she dragged a locker to the corner, stood on it, and pushed at the ceiling. The panel lifted, just as Roger had said, and into the space beyond she thrust the boots and leggings. As an afterthought, she took the alethiometer from her pouch and hid it in the inmost pocket of the anorak before shoving that through too.</div>

<div class="line_en">Because Lyra now realized, if she hadn't done so before, that all the fear in her nature was drawn to Mrs. Coulter as a compass needle is drawn to the Pole. All the other things she'd seen, and even the hideous cruelty of the intercision, she could cope with; she was strong enough; but the thought of that sweet face and gentle voice, the image of that golden playful monkey, was enough to melt her stomach and make her pale and nauseated.</div>

<div class="line_en">Their eyes were gleaming with hope and excitement. And all through the canteen the message was being passed around. Lyra could tell that the atmosphere had changed. Outside, the children had been energetic and eager for play; then when they had seen Mrs. Coulter they were bubbling with a suppressed hysterical fear; but now there was a control and purpose to their talkativeness. Lyra marveled at the effect hope could have.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Probably the conference room," said Annie. "They took us there once," she added, meaning her and her dasmon. "There was about twenty grownups there and one of 'em was giving a lecture and I had to stand there and do what he told me, like seeing how far my Kyrillion could go away from me, and then he hypnotized me and did some other things… It's a big room with a lot of chairs and tables and a little platform.

<div class="line_en">For the rest of the day, Lyra stayed close to the other girls, watching, saying little, remaining inconspicuous. There was exercise, there was sewing, there was supper, there was playtime in the lounge: a big shabby room with board games and a few tattered books and a table-tennis table. At some point Lyra and the others became aware that there was some kind of subdued emergency going on, because the adults were hurrying to and fro or standing in anxious groups talking urgently. Lyra guessed they'd discovered the daemons' escape, and were wondering how it had happened.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天剩下的时间里，莱拉跟另外几个女孩子待在一起，只是注意观察，很少说话，不让别人注意到自己。她们锻炼、上缝纫课、吃晚饭，然后在休息室里玩儿。休息室是一间破旧的大屋子，里面有象棋、几本破烂不堪的书和一张乒乓球台子。后来，莱拉等人意识到周围好像出现了某种被压抑着的紧急情况，因为大人们匆匆忙忙地走来走去，有的站在一起，急切地交谈着，显得焦虑不安。莱拉猜测，他们是发现精灵们都逃走了，但他们弄不懂怎么会发生这种事情。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was quite common for struggles between children to be settled by their daemons in this way, with one accepting the dominance of the other. Their humans accepted the outcome without resentment, on the whole, so Lyra knew that Annie would do as she asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="孩子们之间打架的时候，由他们的精灵按照这样的方式来解决，让一方认可另一方的优势，这种做法相当普遍。总地说来，人们也会毫无怨言地接受这个结果，因此，莱拉知道安妮是会照自己说的去做的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="这时，她们俩的精灵互相瞪着，潘特莱蒙变成一只野猫，安妮的克利里恩变成一只狐狸，两个精灵的身子微微颤抖着。潘特莱蒙发出一声最为低沉、柔和的咝咝声，露出自己的牙齿；克利里恩躲到一旁，开始事不关己地梳理起自己身上的毛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They all contributed items of clothing to bulk out Lyra's bed and make it look as if she was still there, and swore to say they knew nothing about it. Then Lyra listened at the door to make sure no one was coming, jumped up on the locker, pushed up the panel, and hauled herself through.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她们全都拿出一些衣物，让莱拉的床上凸起一块，看上去就像她还在那儿一样。她们发誓，到时候就说什么也不知道。然后，莱拉趴在门上听了听，确定没有人来之后，便跳到柜子上，把天花板上面的那块板条推起来，爬了进去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She got her bearings, working out approximately which direction the conference room was in, and then set off. It was a far from easy journey. She had to move on hands and knees, because the space was too low to crouch in, and every so often she had to squeeze under a big square duct or lift herself over some heating pipes. The metal channels she crawled in followed the tops of internal walls, as far as she could tell, and as long as she stayed in them she felt a comforting solidity below her; but they were very narrow, and had sharp edges, so sharp that she cut her knuckles and her knees on them, and before long she was sore all over, and cramped, and dusty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱拉弄清了自己的位置，辨认了一下会议室的大致方向，然后便动身了。这段路实在是不容易走，只能用手和膝盖爬，因为空间太小，无法蹲着身子。时不时地，她还得从方形的大管道下面挤过去，或者从几条供热管道上面爬过去。莱拉觉得，自己爬过的这几个金属通道都建在内墙的顶上，因为只要待在那儿，她就觉得身子底下的支撑结结实实的，令人放心；但是这些通道都非常狭窄，有着十分锋利的边缘，把她的指关节和膝盖都割破了。没过多久，莱拉便觉得全身疼痛、肌肉痉挛起来，身上满是灰尘。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Just don't say anything," she whispered down to the three faces watching.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“什么都别说，”她冲着下面看着她的三个人的脸低声说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She was crouching in a narrow metal channel supported in a framework of girders and struts. The panels of the ceilings were slightly translucent, so some light came up from below, and in the faint gleam Lyra could see this narrow space (only two feet or so in height) extending in all directions around her. It was crowded with metal ducts and pipes, and it would be easy to get lost in, but provided she kept to the metal and avoided putting any weight on the panels, and as long as she made no noise, she should be able to go from one end of the station to the other.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此时，她正蜷在一条狭窄的金属通道里，横梁和支柱组成的框架支撑着这个通道。天花板上的板条稍微有点儿半透明，这样便有些许亮光从下面透上来。借着微光，莱拉发现，这个狭窄的空间（大约只有两英尺高）在自己的周围通向四面八方，里面挤满了金属管道和导管，很容易在里面迷路，但如果她始终沿着金属架构走，一点儿也不碰那些板条，而且不出任何声响的话，那她应该能够从实验站一端走到另一端。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then she dropped the panel gently back into place and looked around.</div>

<div class="line_en">But she knew roughly where she was, and she could see the dark bulk of her furs crammed in above the dormitory to guide her back. She could tell where a room was empty because the panels were dark, and from time to time she heard voices from below, and stopped to listen, but it was only the cooks in the kitchen, or the nurses in what Lyra, in her Jordan way, thought of as their common room. They were saying nothing interesting, so she moved on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但她知道自己大致是在什么位置，她也能看见她的皮衣那黑乎乎的一团，塞在自己宿舍的上方，给她指明回来的方向。她能分辨出哪间屋子里没人，因为板条上没有光线透上来。她不时地听到从下面传来的声音，她停下来去听，但只是厨房里的厨师，或者是护士在她们的公共活动室里交谈——莱拉按照乔丹学院特有的方式是这样认为的。他们说的话没有任何意义，于是她又继续往前爬。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At last she came to the area where the conference room should be, according to her calculations; and sure enough, there was an area free of any pipework, where air conditioning and heating ducts led down at one end, and where all the panels in a wide rectangular space were lit evenly. She placed her ear to the panel, and heard a murmur of male adult voices, so she knew she had found the right place.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，她来到一个地方。她估摸着，下面就应该是会议室了。的确，这里有一块地方什么管道也没有，空调和供热管道都在一侧，一块宽阔的长方形的空地上，所有的板条都均匀地透着光。她把耳朵贴在板条上，听到有成年男子低沉的说话声。她知道，自己找对了地方。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="然而这些人当然也是有精灵的，所以并不是两个对付三个，而是两个对付六个。那三个精灵——獾、猫头鹰和狒狒——跟他们的主人有着同样的目的，就是要制服潘特莱蒙。莱拉冲着她们哭喊：“为什么？你们为什么要这么做？帮帮我们！你们不该帮他们啊！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But they fell on her again, three big brutal men, and she was only a child, shocked and terrified; and they tore Pantalaimon away, and threw her into one side of the cage of mesh and carried him, struggling still, around to the other. There was a mesh barrier between them, but he was still part of her, they were still joined. For a second or so more, he was still her own dear soul.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，他们又向她扑了过来。那是三个残忍的男人，而她只是个孩子，她惊呆了，吓坏了；他们把潘特莱蒙拖到一边，把莱拉扔到带网眼的罩子一面，然后把还在挣扎着的潘特莱蒙弄到另一面。他们之间隔着一道网，但潘特莱蒙还是莱拉的一部分，他们还是紧密相连的。再过大约一两秒钟之后，他依然是她死去的灵魂。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Above the panting of the men, above her own sobs, above the high wild howl of her daemon, Lyra heard a humming sound, and saw one man (bleeding from the nose) operate a bank of switches. The other two looked up, and her eyes followed theirs. The great pale silver blade was rising slowly, catching the brilliant light. The last moment in her complete life was going to be the worst by far.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="透过那几个男人的沉重气息、自己的呜咽声和潘特莱蒙的尖声疯狂的怒吼，莱拉听到一阵嗡嗡的声音。她看见一个人（鼻子上淌着血）正在操作好几个开关，另两个人则抬头向上看。她顺着他们的目光望去，那个巨大的银质刀刃正在慢慢地上升，在灯光下闪着明晃晃的光。到目前为止，她完整的生命中的最后一刻成了最为不幸的时刻。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And she kicked and bit more passionately than ever, until the man holding her gasped and let go for a moment -- and she was free, and Pantalaimon sprang toward her like a spark of lightning, and she clutched him to her fierce breast, and he dug his wildcat claws into her flesh, and every stab of pain was dear to her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她用脚踢，用牙咬，比以往任何时候都疯狂，抓着她的那个人大口喘着粗气，一下子松开了手——莱拉终于摆脱了控制，潘特莱蒙闪电般地一跃而起，向她扑去。莱拉紧紧抱着他，把他贴在自己激烈跳动的胸膛上，潘特莱蒙的野猫爪子抠进了她的肉里，但对莱拉来说，每一下刺痛她都觉得那么亲切。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They clung together like survivors of a shipwreck, shivering on a desolate coast. Dimly she heard Mrs. Coulter speaking to the men, but she couldn't even interpret her tone of voice.

<div class="line_cn" title="他们像沉船上的幸存者似的，在荒无人烟的海岸上颤抖着身子，相互紧紧地拥抱着。莱拉蒙蒙地听到库尔特夫人在对那几个男人说着什么，但她甚至连她的语气也听不出来。后来，她们便离开那个令人憎恨的房间，库尔特夫人半抱半扶着她，沿着一条走廊，穿过一道门，走进一间卧室。卧室里的空气中散发着香味，里面亮着柔和的灯光。">查看中文翻译</div>
