<div class="line_en">"Of course you mustn't vanish!" said Gandalf. "That wouldn't do at all! I said soon, not instantly. If you can think of any way of slipping out of the Shire without its being generally known, it will be worth a little delay. But you must not delay too long."</div>

<div class="line_en">To tell the truth, he was very reluctant to start, now that it had come to the point. Bag End seemed a more desirable residence than it had for years, and he wanted to savour as much as he could of his last summer in the Shire. When autumn came, he knew that part at least of his heart would think more kindly of journeying, as it always did at that season. He had indeed privately made up his mind to leave on his fiftieth birthday: Bilbo's one hundred and twenty-eighth. It seemed somehow the proper day on which to set out and follow him. Following Bilbo was uppermost in his mind, and the one thing that made the thought of leaving bearable. He thought as little as possible about the Ring, and where it might lead him in the end. But he did not tell all his thoughts to Gandalf. What the wizard guessed was always difficult to tell.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说实话，到了这个地步，他有些不太愿意作准备。袋底洞突然间变成温暖的家，他想尽可能享受在夏尔的最后一个夏天。当秋天来临的时候，他知道自己会比较有心理准备，秋天本就是告别旧事物的好开始。他暗自决定，要在五十岁的生日那天离开：那天也是比尔博的一百二十八岁生日。要跟随比尔博的脚步，似乎就是那天最适当。追随比尔博是他心中最重要的念头，也多亏这个念头才让他感觉好一点。他尽量不想起那戒指，或是戒指可能带他们前往的终点。但他并没有将自己内心的想法告诉甘道夫。巫师倒底猜到多少永远都让人摸不透。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“瑞文戴尔！”佛罗多惊叹道。“好极了：我要往东走，去瑞文戴尔。我可以带着山姆拜访精灵，他一定会很高兴的。”他的声音虽然很低，但心中却突然涌起了激烈的渴望，想要看看半精灵爱隆的住所；呼吸一下那些高贵人种依旧居住的山谷中的空气。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“卖的价钱不错，”有人说。“讨价还价很激烈，”另一个人说，“罗贝拉大妈的手段可不是盖的。”（傲梭几年以前就死了，不算英年早逝，但却不够长命；才一百零二岁而已。）">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Just why Mr. Frodo was selling his beautiful hole was even more debatable than the price. A few held the theory -- supported by the nods and hints of Mr. Baggins himself -- that Frodo's money was running out: he was going to leave Hobbiton and live in a quiet way on the proceeds of the sale down in Buckland among his Brandybuck relations. "As far from the Sackville-Bagginses as may be," some added. But so firmly fixed had the notion of the immeasurable wealth of the Bagginses of Bag End become that most found this hard to believe, harder than any other reason or unreason that their fancy could suggest: to most it suggested a dark and yet unrevealed plot by Gandalf. Though he kept himself very quiet and did not go about by day, it was well known that he was "hiding up in the Bag End". But however a removal might fit in with the designs of his wizardry, there was no doubt about the fact: Frodo Baggins was going back to Buckland.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佛罗多先生卖掉那美丽洞穴的原因比该处的价格更引人争议。有几个人的理论经过巴金斯先生亲自点头和暗示认证：佛罗多的财力已经大不如前，他准备要离开哈比屯，在雄鹿地找个安静的地方住下来，以后可以常常和烈酒鹿家的亲戚往来。“离塞克维尔巴金斯一家人越远越好，”有人补充道。但袋底洞中如山财宝的传说早已根深蒂固的奠基在人们心中，他们实在很难相信这突如其来的转变。不管这个理由多么合理，他们都会自然想到背后有超乎想像的力量在作祟，许多人甚至认为这又是甘道夫的邪恶陰谋。虽然他这次的到访十分低调，但众人也都已经知道他“躲在袋底洞”内。不过，即使这背后可能有魔法的陰谋在作祟，至少有件事情是大家确知的：佛罗多—巴金斯要返回雄鹿地了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As a matter of fact with Merry's help he had already chosen and bought a little house at Crickhollow in the country beyond Bucklebury. To all but Sam he pretended he was going to settle down there permanently.

Then one evening, at the end of June, soon after Frodo's plan had been finally arranged, he suddenly announced that he was going off again next morning. "Only for a short while, I hope," he said.

<div class="line_en">Autumn was well under way before Frodo began to worry about Gandalf again. September was passing and there was still no news of him. The Birthday, and the removal, drew nearer, and still he did not come, or send word. Bag End began to be busy. Some of Frodo's friends came to stay and help him with the packing: there was Fredegar Bolger and Folco Boffin, and of course his special friends Pippin Took and Merry Brandybuck. Between them they turned the whole place upside-down.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当佛罗多又开始担忧甘道夫的时候，已经是深秋了。迈入九月以后，甘道夫还是音讯全无。佛罗多的生日和搬家的日期逐渐逼近，甘道夫依旧全无消息。袋底洞开始忙碌起来。有些佛罗多的朋友前来暂住，协助他进行打包的工作；佛瑞德加—博格和法哥—波芬当然没有错过；他的密友皮聘—图克和梅里—烈酒鹿自然也不会缺席。这一伙人把袋底洞几乎翻了过来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well no; but I have heard something that has made me anxious and needs looking into. If I think it necessary after all for you to get off at once, I shall come back immediately, or at least send word.

<div class="line_en">At first Frodo was a good deal disturbed, and wondered often what Gandalf could have heard; but his uneasiness wore off, and in the fine weather he forgot his troubles for a while.

<div class="line_en">On September 20th two covered carts went off laden to Buckland, conveying the furniture and goods that Frodo had not sold to his new home, by way of the Brandywine Bridge. The next day Frodo became really anxious, and kept a constant look-out for Gandalf. Thursday, his birthday morning, dawned as fair and clear as it had long ago for Bilbo's great party. Still Gandalf did not appear. In the evening Frodo gave his farewell feast: it was quite small, just a dinner for himself and his four helpers; but he was troubled and fell in no mood for it. The thought that he would so soon have to part with his young friends weighed on his heart. He wondered how he would break it to them.</div>

<div class="line_en">After lunch, the Sackville-Bagginses, Lobelia and her sandy-haired son, Lotho, turned up, much to Frodo's annoyance. "Ours at last!" said Lobelia, as she stepped inside. It was not polite; nor strictly true, for the sale of Bag End did not take effect until midnight. But Lobelia can perhaps be forgiven: she had been obliged to wait about seventy-seven years longer for Bag End than she once hoped, and she was now a hundred years old. Anyway, she had come to see that nothing she had paid for had been carried off; and she wanted the keys. It took a long while to satisfy her, as she had brought a complete inventory with her and went right through it. In the end she departed with Lotho and the spare key and the promise that the other key would be left at the Gamgees' in Bagshot Row. She snorted, and showed plainly that she thought the Gamgees capable of plundering the hole during the night. Frodo did not offer her any tea.</div>

<div class="line_en">The sun went down. Bag End seemed sad and gloomy and dishevelled. Frodo wandered round the familiar rooms, and saw the light of the sunset fade on the walls, and shadows creep out of the corners. It grew slowly dark indoors.

I can't bear any more hanging about. I am going to start, and Gandalf must follow me." He turned to go back, and then slopped, for he heard voices, just round the corner by the end of Bagshot Row. One voice was certainly the old Gaffer"s; the other was strange, and somehow unpleasant. He could not make out what it said, but he heard the Gaffer's answers, which were rather shrill. The old man seemed put out.</div>

<div class="line_en">After some time they crossed the Water, west of Hobbiton, by a narrow plank-bridge. The stream was there no more than a winding black ribbon, bordered with leaning alder-trees. A mile or two further south they hastily crossed the great road from the Brandywine Bridge; they were now in the Tookland and bending south-eastwards they made for the Green Hill Country. As they began to climb its first slopes they looked back and saw the lamps in Hobbiton far off twinkling in the gentle valley of the Water. Soon it disappeared in the folds of the darkened land, and was followed by Bywater beside its grey pool. When the light of the last farm was far behind, peeping among the trees, Frodo turned and waved a hand in farewell.</div>

<div class="line_en">When they had walked for about three hours they rested. The night was clear, cool, and starry, but smoke-like wisps of mist were creeping up the hill-sides from the streams and deep meadows. Thin-clad birches, swaying in a light wind above their heads, made a black net against the pale sky. They ate a very frugal supper (for hobbits), and then went on again. Soon they struck a narrow road, that went rolling up and down, fading grey into the darkness ahead: the road to Woodhall, and Stock, and the Bucklebury Ferry. It climbed away from the main road in the Water-valley, and wound over the skirts of the Green Hills towards Woody-End, a wild corner of the Eastfarthing.</div>

<div class="line_en">Just over the top of the hill they came on the patch of fir-wood. Leaving the road they went into the deep resin-scented darkness of the trees, and gathered dead sticks and cones to make a fire. Soon they had a merry crackle of flame at the foot of a large fir-tree and they sat round it for a while, until they began to nod. Then, each in an angle of the great tree's roots, they curled up in their cloaks and blankets, and were soon fast asleep. They set no watch; even Frodo feared no danger yet, for they were still in the heart of the Shire. A few creatures came and looked at them when the fire had died away. A fox passing through the wood on business of his own stopped several minutes and sniffed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们刚越过山丘之后就找到了一堆柴火。三人离开道路，走到有着浓郁树林香气、被黑暗包围的一块平地上。他们收集了一些松针和枯木，很快的就在一棵大树下点起了熊熊的营火。在营火旁坐了一阵子之后，众人纷纷开始打盹。接着，每个人都找个树干舒服的角落靠下来，包着毯子和衣服很快就进入了梦乡。他们并没有派人守夜，连佛罗多也不担心，因为他们还在夏尔的核心地带。当火焰渐渐熄灭的时候，甚至还有几个生物跑过来嗅嗅他们。一只狐狸奔过林荫，停下脚步闻闻他们。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I don't know," said Frodo. It came to me then, as if I was making it up; but I may have heard it long ago. Certainly it reminds me very much of Bilbo in the last years, before he went away. He used often to say there was only one Road; that it was like a great river: its springs were at every doorstep, and every path was its tributary. "It's a dangerous business, Frodo, going out of your door," he used to say. "You step into the Road, and if you don't keep your feet, there is no knowing where you might be swept off to. Do you realize that this is the very path that goes through Mirkwood, and that if you let it, it might take you to the Lonely Mountain or even further and to worse places?" He used to say that on the path outside the front door at Bag End, especially after he had been out for a long walk."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不知道，”佛罗多说。“它突然间出现在我脑海中，彷佛是我作的一般；但也有可能我很多年前听过这歌谣。这的确让我想起比尔博离开前最后的几天。他经常说世上只有一条大路，就像大河一般：每个人的门口都是山泉的发源地，每条岔路都是大河的支流。‘佛罗多，一踏出门口就必须要提高警觉，’他曾经说。‘你一踏上大路，如果不注意自己的脚步，就不知道自己会被冲到哪里去。你知道这就是通往幽暗密林的道路吗？如果你不把持住，它可能会把你送到孤山去；甚至会是更远、更糟糕的地方！’他每次都站在袋底洞的前门对我说，尤其是当他健行回来之后一定会这样。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They looked back, but the turn of the road prevented them from seeing far. "I wonder if that is Gandalf coming after us," said Frodo; but even as he said it, he had a feeling that it was not so, and a sudden desire to hide from the view of the rider came over him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="众人一起转过头去，但不够笔直的道路让他们无法看得太远。“不知道是不是甘道夫追上来了，”佛罗多说。即使当他这样说的时候，他内心却油然生起一股不安，不想让骑士发现自己的行踪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The sun was beginning to get low and the light of afternoon was on the land as they went down the hill. So far they had not met a soul on the road. This way was not much used, being hardly fit for carts, and there was little traffic to the Woody End. They had been jogging along again for an hour or more when Sam stopped a moment as if listening. They were now on level ground, and the road after much winding lay straight ahead through grass-land sprinkled with tall trees, outliers of the approaching woods.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="太陽开始渐渐西沉，午后的陽光懒洋洋的照在下坡的路上。到目前为止，他们在路上什么人也没遇到。这条路不适合车辆行走，因此人烟稀少；平常也没有多少人会去林尾这个地方。他们心情轻松的慢跑了一个多小时，山姆却突然停下来露出警觉的神情。他们已经到了平地，之前百转千折的道路现在也成了平坦笔直的大道，两边是怡人的草地，森林边同时点缀着几棵高大的树木。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Round the corner came a black horse, no hobbit-pony but a full-sized horse; and on it sat a large man, who seemed to crouch in the saddle, wrapped in a great black cloak and hood, so that only his boots in the high stirrups showed below; his face was shadowed and invisible.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一匹黑马从路的另一头出现了，它不是哈比人骑的小马，而是人类所惯骑的高大马匹。马背上坐着一个高大的人，他裹着长大的披风、戴着兜帽，似乎趴在马背上。只有在高马镫上的靴子出现在下面，他的脸被遮蔽了，看不见了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The other two ran quickly to the left and down into a little hollow not far from the road. There they lay flat. Frodo hesitated for a second: curiosity or some other feeling was struggling with his desire to hide. The sound of hoofs drew nearer. Just in time he threw himself down in a patch of long grass behind a tree that overshadowed the road. Then he lifted his head and peered cautiously above one of the great roots.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="另外两个人飞快的跑向道路左边不远的树丛中，立刻趴了下来。佛罗多迟疑了一瞬间：彷佛是好奇心还是某种特殊的力量在阻挡他的行动。蹄声越来越近。他在最后一秒才躲进路旁大树下的一堆长草中。然后他抬起头，好奇的从树根旁抬起头窥探。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When it reached the tree and was level with Frodo the horse stopped. The riding figure sat quite still with its head bowed, as if listening. From inside the hood came a noise as of someone sniffing to catch an elusive scent; the head turned from side to side of the road.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当它到达树旁，和佛罗多在同一水平高度，马停了下来。骑马的身子静静地坐着，头低垂着，好像在听。从兜帽底下的陰影中传来嗅闻的声音；应该是人类面孔的地方往左右打量着路旁的草地。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A sudden unreasoning fear of discovery laid hold of Frodo, and he thought of his Ring. He hardly dared to breathe, and yet the desire to get it out of his pocket became so strong that he began slowly to move his hand. He felt that he had only to slip it on, and then he would be safe. The advice of Gandalf seemed absurd. Bilbo had used the Ring. "And I am still in the Shire," he thought, as his hand touched the chain on which it hung. At that moment the rider sat up, and shook the reins. The horse stepped forward, walking slowly at first, and then breaking into a quick trot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一阵毫无缘由的恐惧突然攫住了佛罗多，他开始害怕被发现、开始想到身上的魔戒。他大气也不敢出，但有股强烈的欲望不停召唤他取出魔戒；他的手甚至已经开始慢慢的移动。甘道夫的忠告变得微不足道。反正比尔博以前也用过魔戒。“而我还在夏尔，”他想着，手已经握住魔戒的练子。就在此时，骑士身形一挺，甩了几下缰绳。黑马起初缓步向前，最后开始疾驰。">查看中文翻译</div>

Soon the road began to fall gently but steadily into the dusk. A star came out above the trees in the darkening East before them. They went abreast and in step, to keep up their spirits. After a time, as the stars grew thicker and brighter, the feeling of disquiet left them, and they no longer listened for the sound of hoofs. They began to hum softly, as hobbits have a way of doing as they walk along, especially when they are drawing near to home at night. With most hobbits it is a supper-song or a bed-song; but these hobbits hummed a walking-song (though not, of course, without any mention of supper and bed). Bilbo Baggins had made the words, to a tune that was as old as the hills, and taught it to Frodo as they walked in the lanes of the Water-valley and talked about Adventure.</div>

<div class="line_en">The hoofs drew nearer. They had no time to find any hiding-place better than the general darkness under the trees; Sam and Pippin crouched behind a large tree-bole, while Frodo crept back a few yards towards the lane. It showed grey and pale, a line of fading light through the wood. Above it the stars were thick in the dim sky, but there was no moon.</div>

At last the Elves turned aside from the path. A green ride lay almost unseen through the thickets on the right; and this they followed as it wound away back up the wooded slopes on to the top of a shoulder of the hills that stood out into the lower land of the river-valley. Suddenly they came out of the shadow of the trees, and before them lay a wide space of grass, grey under the night. On three sides the woods pressed upon it; but eastward the ground fell steeply and the tops of the dark trees, growing at the bottom of the slope, were below their feet.

<div class="line_en">They spoke of many things, old and new, and Frodo questioned Gildor much about happenings in the wide world outside the Shire. The tidings were mostly sad and ominous: of gathering darkness, the wars of Men, and the flight of the Elves. At last Frodo asked the question that was nearest to his heart:</div>

<div class="line_en">Frodo sat, eating, drinking, and talking with delight; but his mind was chiefly on the words spoken. He knew a little of the elf-speech and listened eagerly. Now and again he spoke to those that served him and thanked them in their own language. They smiled at him and said laughing: "Here is a jewel among hobbits!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佛罗多跟着席地而坐，快乐的吃喝，和精灵们交谈着。但他全副的注意力都集中在对方谈话的内容上。他懂得一些精灵语，因此十分专注的倾听着。偶尔他也会对送食物和饮料给他的精灵用精灵语道谢。他们会笑着回答：“这位可真是哈比人中之宝啊！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After a while Pippin fell fast asleep, and was lifted up and borne away to a bower under the trees; there he was laid upon a soft bed and slept the rest of the night away. Sam refused to leave his master. When Pippin had gone, he came and sat curled up at Frodo's feet, where at last he nodded and closed his eyes. Frodo remained long awake, talking with Gildor.</div>

<div class="line_en">Gildor was silent for a moment. "I do not like this news," he said at last. "That Gandalf should be late, does not bode well. But it is said: Do not meddle in the affairs of Wizards, for they are subtle and quick to anger. The choice is yours: to go or wait."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔多沉默了片刻。“这消息让我很担心，”他最后终于说。“甘道夫迟迟未出现并不是个好兆头。不过，俗谚有云：不要插手巫师的事务，他们重心机，易动怒。要等、要走，关键都看你。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I think you should still follow that plan," said Gildor. "I do not think the Road will prove too hard for your courage. But if you desire clearer counsel, you should ask Gandalf. I do not know the reason for your flight, and therefore I do not know by what means your pursuers will assail you. These things Gandalf must know. I suppose that you will see him before you leave the Shire?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我认为你还是应该保持原订计划不变，”吉尔多说。“我不认为前路的凶险能够阻挡你的勇气。但，如果你想要更深入的分析，你应该去找甘道夫。我不知道你逃亡的原因，因此也无法得知你的敌人会如何追击你。甘道夫对这些事情一定了若指掌。我猜你在离开夏尔之前会去找他吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I hope so. But that is another thing that makes me anxious. I have been expecting Gandalf for many days. He was to have come to Hobbiton at the latest two nights ago; but he has never appeared. Now I am wondering what can have happened. Should I wait for him?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我希望能找到他。但有另外一件事情让我坐立不安。我已经等甘道夫等了很多天了。他最慢也该在两天前抵达哈比屯，但他根本没有出现。我现在开始担心他是否遭遇了什么状况。我应该继续等他吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And it is also said," answered Frodo: "Go not to the Elves for counsel, for they will say both no and yes."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我记得谚语中还有一句话，”佛罗多回答：“别向精灵询问，因为他们会不置可否。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Is it indeed?" laughed Gildor. "Elves seldom give unguarded advice, for advice is a dangerous gift, even from the wise to the wise, and all courses may run ill. But what would you? You have not told me all concerning yourself; and how then shall I choose better than you? But if you demand advice, I will for friendship's sake give it. I think you should now go at once, without delay; and if Gandalf does not come before you set out, then I also advise this: do not go alone. Take such friends as are trusty and willing. Now you should be grateful, for I do not give this counsel gladly. The Elves have their own labours and their own sorrows, and they are little concerned with the ways of hobbits, or of any other creatures upon earth. Our paths cross theirs seldom, by chance or purpose. In this meeting there may be more than chance; but the purpose is not clear to me, and I fear to say too much."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“真的吗？”吉尔多笑了。“精灵们很少会给人直接了当的忠告。忠告是种危险的礼物，即使是智者送给智者的忠告都会因为命运的作弄而出轨。但你不也是一样？你没有告诉我背后的真相，我怎么能够作出比你更正确的决定？如果你真的坚持要我给你建议，看在友情的份上我还是愿意给你一点提示。我认为你应该即刻动身。如果在你离开前甘道夫依旧没有出现，我还必须建议你不要单独行事。带着值得信任、自愿的朋友上路。你该很感激我才是，因为我并不是心甘情愿的介入你的事情。精灵们有自己的目标和包袱，我们极少关切哈比人，或是世界上其它生物的命运。不管是巧合或是刻意，我们和其他人的命运都极少交会。我们的会面可能不只是巧合，但我还不太明白背后的意义；恐怕我已经说了太多了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
