<div class="line_en">My operating the crane was one of a hundred disputes between Dad and Shawn that Shawn won that summer. Most were not resolved so peacefully. They argued nearly every day -- about a flaw in the schematics or a tool that had been left at home. Dad seemed eager to fight, to prove who was in charge.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那年夏天，肖恩和父亲之间发生了上百次争执，肖恩赢了很多次，由我负责操作起重机就是其中之一。但大多数问题没有得到如此和平的解决。他们几乎每天都吵——因为设计图表上的一个缺陷，或落在家里的一件工具。爸爸似乎渴望争斗，以此来证明谁是老大。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Construction began on the milking barn in Oneida. Shawn designed and welded the main frame -- the massive beams that formed the skeleton of the building. They were too heavy for the loader; only a crane could lift them. It was a delicate procedure, requiring the welders to balance on opposite ends of a beam while it was lowered onto columns, then welded in place. Shawn surprised everyone when he announced that he wanted me to operate the crane.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="奥奈达的牛奶仓库开始动工。肖恩设计和焊接主框架——构成建筑物骨架的巨大横梁。它们对装载机来说太重了；只有起重机才能将它们吊起来。这个程序是个精细活儿，要求焊工在大梁降至柱子上时使其两端保持平衡，然后焊接到位。当肖恩宣布他想让我操作起重机时，大家都吃了一惊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">An hour later I was in the man box, and Shawn and Luke were standing on either end of a beam, twenty feet in the air. I brushed the lever lightly, listening as the hydraulic cylinders hissed softly to protract. "Hold!" Shawn shouted when the beam was in place, then they nodded their helmets down and began to weld.</div>

<div class="line_en">One afternoon Dad walked over and stood right next to Shawn, watching him weld. A minute later, for no reason, he started shouting: that Shawn had taken too long at lunch, that he wasn't getting the crew up early enough or working us hard enough. Dad yelled for several minutes, then Shawn took off his welding helmet, looked at him calmly and said, "You gonna shut up so I can work?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天下午，爸爸走到肖恩旁边，看着他焊接。一分钟后，他无缘无故地大喊：肖恩吃午饭的时间太长，没能让小工队早起，也不催促我们努力干活。爸爸喊了几分钟，接着肖恩摘下焊接头盔，平静地看着他说：“你能不能闭嘴，让我干活？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dad kept yelling. He said Shawn was lazy, that he didn't know how to run a crew, didn't understand the value of hard work. Shawn stepped down from his welding and ambled over to the flatbed pickup. Dad followed, still hollering. Shawn pulled off his gloves, slowly, delicately, one finger at a time, as if there weren't a man screaming six inches from his face. For several moments he stood still, letting the abuse wash over him, then he stepped into the pickup and drove off, leaving Dad to shout at the dust.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爸爸还在吼个不停。他说肖恩很懒，不懂得如何管理团队，不明白努力工作的价值。肖恩停下焊接的活儿，慢慢走到平板皮卡旁。爸爸跟在后面，仍然大喊大叫。肖恩慢慢地一个指头一个指头摘下手套。有人在离他脸旁六英寸的近旁吼叫，他好像全当不存在。有好一会儿，他站在那里一动不动，任由辱骂将自己淹没，然后钻进皮卡一溜烟开走了，只留下爸爸对着飞扬的尘土喊叫。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I remember the awe I felt as I watched that pickup roll down the dirt road. Shawn was the only person I had ever seen stand up to Dad, the only one whose force of mind, whose sheer tonnage of conviction, could make Dad give way. I had seen Dad lose his temper and shout at every one of my brothers. Shawn was the only one I ever saw walk away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我还记得当我望着皮卡沿土路驶远时心中涌起的敬畏之情。肖恩是我见过的唯一一个敢和爸爸抗争的人，也是唯一一个能凭借强烈的意志和坚定的信念让爸爸屈服让步的人。我曾见过爸爸对每个哥哥大发脾气、又喊又叫。肖恩是我见过的唯一一个一走了之的人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We paused the movie when Grandma delivered the brownies. We ate them in silence, our spoons clicking loudly against Grandma's porcelain plates. "You'll get your twenty-seven," Shawn said suddenly when we'd finished.</div>

<div class="line_en">The phone rang. It was Shawn. Did I want to watch a movie? I said I did, and a few minutes later I heard a loud rumble and looked out the window.

Grandma started making brownies, and Shawn and I went upstairs to choose a movie.</div>

<div class="line_en">The movie ended. We told Grandma good night. It was a balmy summer evening, perfect for the motorcycle, and Shawn said I should ride home with him, we'd get the car tomorrow.

<div class="line_en">I drove in a happy stupor. The night was black -- that thick darkness that belongs only in backcountry, where the houses are few and the streetlights fewer, where starlight goes unchallenged. I navigated the winding highway as I'd done numberless times before, racing down the Bear River Hill, coasting through the flat stretch parallel to Fivemile Creek. Up ahead the road climbed and bent to the right. I knew the curve was there without looking for it, and wondered at the still headlights I saw shining in the blackness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="开车回家的路上我心情愉悦，将头脑放空。那是一个漆黑的夜晚——那种黑只属于穷乡僻壤的野外，住户稀少，路灯更少，星光一览无余。我像以前无数次那样，沿着蜿蜒的高速公路穿行，顺着贝尔河山疾驰而下，在与五里溪平行的平坦路段滑行。一路向北爬升，再右转弯。不用看我也知道前方哪里有弯道。所以当见到黑暗中原地闪烁的车前灯时，我暗自纳闷发生了什么事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I began the ascent. There was a pasture to my left, a ditch to my right. As the incline began in earnest I saw three cars pulled off near the ditch. The doors were open, the cab lights on. Seven or eight people huddled around something on the gravel. I changed lanes to drive around them, but stopped when I saw a small object lying in the middle of the highway.</div>

<div class="line_en">Shawn's body was contorted, his back twisted. I had no idea how long an ambulance might take, and there was so much blood. I decided to stop the bleeding.

<div class="line_en">The crowd parted to let me through. Shawn was facedown on the gravel, lying in a pool of blood that looked pink in the glare from the headlights. He wasn't moving. "He hit a cow coming around the corner," a man said. "It's so dark tonight, he didn't even see it. We've called an ambulance. We don't dare move him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="人群分开让我通过。肖恩脸朝下趴在碎石上，躺在一摊血泊中。在车灯的强光下，血呈粉红色。他一动不动。“他撞上了角落里的一头牛。”一个男人说，“天太黑了，他没看见它。我们不敢动他，已经叫了救护车。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dwain hefted Shawn onto his back. For a second that contained an hour, I stared at my brother, watching the blood trickle out of his temple and down his right cheek, pouring over his ear and onto his white T-shirt. His eyes were closed, his mouth open. The blood was oozing from a hole the size of a golf ball in his forehead. It looked as though his temple had been dragged on the asphalt, scraping away skin, then bone. I leaned close and peered inside the wound. Something soft and spongy glistened back at me. I slipped out of my jacket and pressed it to Shawn's head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="德万抬起肖恩，让他脸朝上。一时间，我盯着哥哥，看着血从他的太阳穴汩汩流出来，顺着右脸颊灌进他的耳朵，滴到他的白色T恤上。他双眼紧闭，嘴巴张开。血是从他前额一个高尔夫球般大小的洞里涌出来的。似乎他的太阳穴处被拖在柏油路上，蹭掉了皮肤，露出了骨头。我靠近他，凝视伤口内部。有个柔软的海绵状的东西在反光。我脱下夹克衫，把它按压在肖恩头上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The doctor gave Shawn a CAT scan. He said the wound was nasty but the damage was minimal, and then I remembered what the last doctors had told me -- that with head injuries, often the ones that look the worst are actually less severe -- and I felt stupid for panicking and bringing him here. The hole in the bone was small, the doctor said. It might grow over on its own, or a surgeon could put in a metal plate. Shawn said he'd like to see how it healed, so the doctor folded the skin over the hole and stitched it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="医生给肖恩做了造影扫描，说伤口很严重，但损伤不大。然后我想起了之前的医生说过的话：对于头部受伤而言，那些看上去最糟糕的情况实际上往往并不严重。惊慌之下带他来到这里，让我觉得自己真蠢。医生说，骨头上的洞很小，很可能自己就会长好，或者可以让外科医生放一块金属板进去。肖恩说他想让伤口自己愈合，于是医生用皮肤把洞遮住，然后缝合。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sitting across from me is my father, and as I look into his worn face it hits me, a truth so powerful I don't know why I've never understood it before. The truth is this: that I am not a good daughter. I am a traitor, a wolf among sheep; there is something different about me and that difference is not good. I want to bellow, to weep into my father's knees and promise never to do it again. But wolf that I am, I am still above lying, and anyway he would sniff the lie. We both know that if I ever again find Shawn on the highway, soaked in crimson, I will do exactly what I have just done.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="父亲坐在我对面，看着他憔悴的脸，我突然悟出一个强大的事实，不知道为何我以前从未意识到这点。事实是：我不是一个好女儿。我是一个叛徒，羊群中的一匹狼。我有一些地方与众不同，这种不同很不好。我想咆哮，想扑倒在父亲的膝头哭泣，发誓自己再也不这么做了。但我是狼，我还在撒谎，无论如何他会嗅出谎言。我们都心知肚明，如果再看到肖恩躺在公路上，浸泡在血色之中，我还是会做出同样的选择。">查看中文翻译</div>

I drove to the only grocery store in town, called Stokes, and applied for a job bagging groceries. I was only sixteen, but I didn't tell the manager that and he hired me for forty hours a week. My first shift started at four o'clock the next morning.</div>

I would go somewhere, even if it wasn't to school. Home had changed the moment I'd taken Shawn to that hospital instead of to Mother. I had rejected some part of it; now it was rejecting me.</div>

<div class="line_en">Three Days Before I turned seventeen, Mother drove me to Utah to find an apartment. The search took all day, and we arrived home late to find Dad eating a frozen supper. He hadn't cooked it well and it was mush. The mood around him was charged, combustible. It felt like he might detonate at any moment. Mother didn't even kick off her shoes, just rushed to the kitchen and began shuffling pans to fix a real dinner. Dad moved to the living room and started cursing at the VCR. I could see from the hallway that the cables weren't connected. When I pointed this out, he exploded. He cussed and waved his arms, shouting that in a man's house the cables should always be hooked up, that a man should never have to come into a room and find the cables to his VCR unhooked. Why the hell had I unhooked them anyway?</div>
