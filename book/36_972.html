<div class="line_en">The Vances, who had been back in the city ever since Christmas, had not forgotten Carrie; but they, or rather Mrs. Vance, had never called on her, for the very simple reason that Carrie had never sent her address. True to her nature, she corresponded with Mrs. Vance as long as she still lived in Seventy-eighth Street, but when she was compelled to move into Thirteenth, her fear that the latter would take it as an indication of reduced circumstances caused her to study some way of avoiding the necessity of giving her address. Not finding any convenient method, she sorrowfully resigned the privilege of writing to her friend entirely. The latter wondered at this strange silence, thought Carrie must have left the city, and in the end gave her up as lost. So she was thoroughly surprised to encounter her in Fourteenth Street, where she had gone shopping. Carrie was there for the same purpose.</div>

<div class="line_en">This thing was the remains of his old-time cocksureness and independence. Sitting in his flat, and reading of the doings of other people, sometimes this independent, undefeated mood came upon him. Forgetting the weariness of the streets and the degradation of search, he would sometimes prick up his ears. It was as if he said: "I can do something. I'm not down yet. There's a lot of things coming to me if I want to go after them."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是他从前的过于自信和独立精神残留在他身上的东西。他坐在家里，从报上看着别人的活动，有时就会产生这种自以为是、不肯服输的心情。一旦忘记了在街上到处奔波的疲劳感和四处寻找的落魄相时，他有时就会竖起耳朵，仿佛听见自己在说：“我还是有事可做的。我还没有完蛋呢。只要我愿意下劲去找，会找到很多事情做的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was in this mood that he would occasionally dress up, go for a shave, and, putting on his gloves, sally forth quite actively. Not with any definite aim. It was more a barometric condition. He felt just right for being outside and doing something.</div>

<div class="line_en">It is but fair to say that this thought had occurred to him several times before he acted upon it. The poker room which he first invaded was over a saloon in West Street, near one of the ferries. He had been there before. Several games were going. These he watched for a time and noticed that the pots were quite large for the ante involved.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="公道一些说，他是在有过好几次这样的想法之后才付诸行动的。他第一次去的那家赌场是在西街一家酒店的楼上，靠近一个渡口。他以前去过那里。同时有几桌牌在打。他观察了一会儿，就每次发牌前下的底注来看，牌局的输赢数目是很可观的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He had once been accustomed to hold a pretty fair hand at poker. Many a friendly game had netted him a hundred dollars or more at the time when that sum was merely sauce to the dish of the game -- not the all in all. Now, he thought of playing.</div>

<div class="line_en">The next afternoon he was back again, seeking amusement and profit. This time he followed up three of a kind to his doom. There was a better hand across the table, held by a pugnacious Irish youth, who was a political hanger-on of the Tammany district in which they were located. Hurstwood was surprised at the persistence of this individual, whose bets came with a sang- froid which, if a bluff, was excellent art. Hurstwood began to doubt, but kept, or thought to keep, at least, the cool demeanour with which, in olden times, he deceived those psychic students of the gaming table, who seem to read thoughts and moods, rather than exterior evidences, however subtle. He could not down the cowardly thought that this man had something better and would stay to the end, drawing his last dollar into the pot, should he choose to go so far. Still, he hoped to win much -- his hand was excellent. Why not raise it five more?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="次日下午，他又来了，想找点乐趣并赢些钱。这一次，他拿到一副三条的牌，坚持打了下去，结果输得很惨。和他对桌的是一个好斗的爱尔兰青年。此人是当地坦慕尼派控制的选区的一个政治食客，他手里有一副更好的牌。这个家伙打牌时咬住对方不放，这使赫斯渥吃了一惊。他连连下注而且不动声色，如果他是要诱使对方摊牌，这种手段也是很高明的。赫斯渥开始拿不准了，但是还保持着至少是想要保持着镇定的神态，从前他就是凭这个来骗过那些工于心计的赌徒的。这些赌徒似乎是在琢磨对方的思想和心情，而不是在观察对方外表的迹象，不管这些迹象有多微妙。他克服不了内心的胆怯，想着这人是有着一副更好的牌，会坚持到底，倘若他愿意的话，会把最后的一块钱也放入赌注的。可是，他还是希望能多赢点钱——他手上的牌好极了。为什么不再加5块钱的注呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He ascended into the fine parlour of the Morton House, then one of the best New York hotels, and, finding a cushioned seat, read. It did not trouble him much that his decreasing sum of money did not allow of such extravagance. Like the morphine fiend, he was becoming addicted to his ease. Anything to relieve his mental distress, to satisfy his craving for comfort. He must do it. No thoughts for the morrow -- he could not stand to think of it any more than he could of any other calamity. Like the certainty of death, he tried to shut the certainty of soon being without a dollar completely out of his mind, and he came very near doing it.</div>

<div class="line_en">His dinner cost him $1.50. By eight o'clock he was through, and then, seeing guests leaving and the crowd of pleasure-seekers thickening outside wondered where he should go. Not home. Carrie would be up. No, he would not go back there this evening. He would stay out and knock around as a man who was independent -- not broke -- well might. He bought a cigar, and went outside on the corner where other individuals were lounging -- brokers, racing people, thespians -- his own flesh and blood. As he stood there, he thought of the old evenings in Chicago, and how he used to dispose of them. Many's the game he had had. This took him to poker.</div>

<div class="line_en">So off he went to a poker room in the neighbourhood, feeling much as he had in the old days. In this period of self-forgetfulness, aroused first by the shock of argument and perfected by a dinner in the hotel, with cocktails and cigars, he was as nearly like the old Hurstwood as he would ever be again. It was not the old Hurstwood -- only a man arguing with a divided conscience and lured by a phantom.</div>

As before, it went easy for a while, he winning a few times and cheering up, losing a few pots and growing more interested and determined on that account. At last the fascinating game took a strong hold on him. He enjoyed its risks and ventured, on a trifling hand, to bluff the company and secure a fair stake. To his self-satisfaction intense and strong, he did it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这家赌场和那一家差不多，只是它设在一家高级一些的酒店的密室里。赫斯渥先旁观了一会儿，然后看见了一局有趣的牌，就加入了。就像上次一样，开始一阵子打得很顺手，他赢了几次，兴奋起来，又输了几次，兴趣更大了，因此决心玩下去。最终，这个迷人的赌博把他牢牢地拴住了。他喜欢其中的风险，手上拿着一副小牌，也敢吓唬对方，想赢一笔可观的赌注。使他深感满意的是，他还真的赢了。">查看中文翻译</div>
