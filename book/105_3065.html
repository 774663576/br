<div class="line_en">As the light dimmed, particles of colour began to form. They swirled around Tristan's head and settled on the ground, creating surroundings, creating the world that his next mission, the next soul, was soon to leave. As he walked, tarmac formed under his feet, black and shiny with rain. Buildings erupted from the ground on either side of Tristan. Lighted windows illuminated ill-kept front gardens, adorned with overgrown weeds and broken fences. The cars parked on the kerb and in the occasional paved garden were old and rusted. Heavy thudding music beats and raucous laughter spilled from open doorways. The whole place had an air of poverty and carelessness. It made a depressing picture.</div>

<div class="line_en">As Tristan walked, the landscape around him slowly faded away to white. He barely noticed. The hills disappeared, disintegrating into sand that floated upwards and evaporated into a thin mist. The path he was striding along was replaced by a featureless surface that reached out as far as the eye could see in every direction. A white light flashed, blinding him at its zenith.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="崔斯坦走着，身边的景色慢慢变成一片惨白，而他几乎毫无察觉。群山消失了，崩塌碎裂成浮动的沙海，随即又蒸腾成薄雾。他刚才走的那条小路变成了毫无特征的平面，目力所及之处，四面八方全都千篇一律。一道白光闪烁，光的顶点亮得他睁不开眼。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tristan felt no excitement or thrill at the prospect of collecting the next soul. He did not even feel the disdain and indifference that had become habitual in recent years. He felt only the torturous ache of loss.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="想到要迎接下一个灵魂，崔斯塔既无半分激动也无丝毫的紧张，心中甚至没有近年来惯常的厌恶和冷漠，他只感到一种怅然若失的痛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He stopped at the second to last house from the end of the street. Amidst the shabby, ramshackle buildings along the road, this one was surprisingly well cared for. There was a neat lawn surrounded by flowers. Stepping stones carved with birds laid an inviting path to the recently painted red door. There was only one window lit, in a room on the second floor. Tristan knew that was where the next soul was located, about to part from its body. He did not enter the house, but waited outside.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他在街道尽头倒数第二间房子前停下了脚步。在一大堆简陋破败的建筑物间，这座房子被打理得格外体面。房前的草坪干净整洁，簇拥着鲜花；垫脚石上雕着飞鸟花纹，铺成了一条引人驻足的小道，直通刚刚用红漆粉饰一新的大门。崔斯坦知道这就是下一个即将与肉体分离的灵魂栖息之所。他没有进门，只是在外面等着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Several passersby looked at the stranger loitering outside number twenty-four. They could tell that he did not belong here. However, this was not the sort of place where you challenged an unfamiliar face, and so they continued on their way without comment. Tristan, staring unseeingly into nothing, didn't notice the quizzical looks; didn't register that they could see him. He was blind to their curious eyes and deaf to the mutterings that broke out a step or two before they were out of earshot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几个过路的人打量着这位在二十四号门口徘徊的陌生人，他们知道他是外来的。但这里的人习惯自扫门前雪，所以他们只是一言不发地继续走路。崔斯坦心不在焉、目光呆滞，不曾注意到人们探询的神情，甚至没有注意到有人在看他。他对他们好奇的眼神视而不见，对几步之外的窃窃私语充耳不闻。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He already knew everything he needed to about the person who had lived here. She had lived here alone for ten years, going out little except to work and make weekly visits to her mother who lived across town. She did not mix with any of the local people and they regarded her as snobby and aloof, when really she was just afraid of them. She had just been stabbed to death in her bed by a burglar who had expected to find more valuables than she had possessed and had murdered her in anger. Soon she would wake and get up, continuing her morning routine as usual. She would not notice that her jewellery box was missing, or that the smart digital camera for which she had saved for a year was no longer nestled safely in the dresser drawer in the dining room. She would decide to skip breakfast, thinking that she was slightly late. When she went outside, she would be greeted by Tristan and, one way or another, she would follow him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对于住在这里的那个人，他已经了解了一切自己需要的事情。她独居在这里十年了，除了工作和每周看望一次住在小城另一端的母亲外，平时都很少出门。她不跟当地人交际，他们觉得她势利眼、假清高，而实际上她只是害怕他们。她刚刚在床上被一个窃贼捅死。那人本想在她家里找些值钱东西，结果却大失所望，一怒之下就杀了她。很快她就会睡醒起床，和往常一样继续按部就班完成那些日常琐事。她不会注意到自己的珠宝盒子已经不翼而飞，也不会察觉到用自己几年的积蓄购买的智能数码照相机现在并没有安安稳稳地躺在饭厅的抽屉里。她只觉得自己有点迟到了，因此决定不吃早餐。她出门的时候就会遇到崔斯坦，不管怎样，她都会跟他走的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">All of this information was now assimilated in Tristan's mind. Facts and stories interweaving to make up the knowledge he needed to perform his job. He knew it, but he did not think about it. The journey of this soul would be completed because that was his role. He was here simply because he had to be. But he would feel no pity for this unfortunate creature. He would give her no sympathy or comfort. He would guide her, nothing more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在，崔斯坦心里已经把所有的相关信息都消化吸收了。他只需把事实和故事糅合在一起了解一下就能完成这次任务了。他对这些事情了然于胸，但不会多想一下。他会指引这个灵魂走完这段旅程，因为这是他的职责。他来这里只是因为身不由己。然而他对这个不幸的人不会有任何恻隐之心，既不会对她施以同情，也不会对她好言安慰。他只会引导她，如此而已。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The moon was directly overhead, a stark white light that sought out and banished shadows. Tristan felt exposed in his raw and vulnerable state, as if every emotion and thought were laid bare, to be read by everyone. He knew that he would have hours to wait before the soul would emerge. He wondered how much longer he could go on. Every fibre of his being yearned to escape and hide, to give himself over to the pain and grief. His brain told his feet to move, to turn away and keep walking until he left his sorrow behind him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="月亮在头顶正上方，一道惨白的月光寻觅并驱散阴影。崔斯坦感觉自己似乎又回到了造化之初混沌脆弱的状态，好像自己的所有感情、所有想法都已暴露无遗，任何人都能看穿自己。他知道还要等上几个小时灵魂才会出现，他不知道自己还能坚持多久。他打心底里渴望离开这里找个地方躲起来，沉溺在痛苦和悲伤中。他的头脑对双脚发出指令，命令它们掉转方向径直离开，一直走下去，直到他彻底抛掉悲伤。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For the second time, tears sprang into his piercing blue eyes. Of course he would not be allowed to abscond his post. There was a higher order, a grander scheme of things. And his pain, his despair, his desire to relinquish this responsibility meant nothing. He did not control his destiny. He could not even control his feet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他迷人的蓝眼睛里又一次噙满了泪水。他当然不可能逃离自己的岗位，在他之上还有更高的自然法则，还有不可撼动的命运。他的痛苦，他的绝望，他放弃自己职责的欲望都无足轻重。他无法掌控自己的命运，他甚至无法控制自己的双脚。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She was aware of somebody behind her calling her name, but she didn't turn. Like the night she'd spent alone in the safe house, she couldn't tear her eyes away from the scene in front of her. If she looked away, Tristan was really gone.</div>

<div class="line_en">She flinched as the voice called to her again. She couldn't guess if it was male or female, old or young. It didn't sound impatient or urgent. It was welcoming.</div>

<div class="line_en">Who was she fooling? He was already gone. He was gone and he wasn't coming back. She just wasn't quite ready to accept it yet. Dylan stared at the path defiantly. Her teeth bit down on her lower lip, cutting down hard enough to split the skin and taste blood. She didn't. Her senses were numb.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她在糊弄谁呢？崔斯坦已经不见了，而且再也不会回来了。她只是还没有做好准备接受这一切。迪伦挑衅似的继续注视着前路，用力挫着下嘴唇，直到口中弥漫出血腥味。不，她尝不到的。她的感官已经麻木了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dylan huffed, growing irritated. The voice was going to continue until she answered it, she realised. Slowly, reluctantly, she turned round.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦生气了，火冒三丈。她明白了，这声音非要等自己应答，否则绝不善罢甘休。她慢慢地，不情不愿地转过了身子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For a second she blinked, confused. There was nothing there. Her mouth opened, ready to call out, hoping the voice would speak again, but she closed it slowly. What the hell did it matter?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她眨了眨眼，完全糊涂了，身后什么也没有。她张了张嘴，本打算喊出声来，希望那声音再响一次，不过她又慢慢闭上了嘴。它响不响又有什么关系呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She was about to turn back, to resume her sentry duty, gazing back down the path in the vain hope that Tristan would miraculously reappear, but as she looked away, something odd and out of place caught her eye. A light, glowing. For a second her heart leaped, thinking of the orbs she'd seen floating in the blood-red wasteland, but it wasn't the same. It grew and changed shape, elongating, forming. It smiled at her, and the expression, too, was welcoming. It sat in the middle of a pale, perfect face surrounded by a cloud of white-blond hair. The body looked human enough in shape, but not quite right. Like the glimpses of souls she'd seen, it was there but not there; half in, half out of focus.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她打算转过身，眼睛盯着地，继续按部就班地走下去，心里还在痴想着崔斯坦会奇迹般突然出现在自己身边。然而就在她转过脸的瞬间，一个与此地格格不入的古怪东西映入了她的眼帘，那是一束光。她的心顿时狂跳了一下，想起了在血色的荒原上见过的那些光球。然而这次不一样，那束光慢慢变大，改变着形状，延伸，最后成形。他在向迪伦微笑，那表情依旧十分客气。一张苍白、完美无瑕的脸，周围是一丛浅浅的金发。他的身体形状看起来跟人类差不多，但是总有地方不大对劲。就像是她曾经见过的那些灵魂一样，亦真亦幻，虚实不明。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No, that's not what I mean. The wasteland. I want to go back to the wasteland." Dylan looked around at the flat expanse of heathland still surrounding her. A quick glance over her shoulder confirmed that the horseshoe of hills remained. It seemed like she was still in the wasteland, strictly speaking, but since crossing the line, it wasn't the same place. Not at all. "I want…" Dylan tailed off. The being, Caeli, was giving her an incredulous look</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，我不是这个意思。我指的是荒原，我想回到荒原上。”迪伦环顾四周欧石楠丛生的平坦荒野，蓦然回首，那片连绵起伏的马蹄形群山还在。严格来说，好像此时她依然在荒原上。然而自从跨过那道分界线后，她就已经身处异域了，完全不是同一个地方。“我想……”迪伦变得有些吞吞吐吐。那个东西，萨利，向她投来怀疑的目光。">查看中文翻译</div>

It looked ridiculous hovering there without a purpose, without a fence stretching away from either side of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你现在不再需要他了，他已经完成了他的任务。请跟我走吧。”这次那个东西转身指了指身后。从小路向前没多远，出现了一个勉强称得上是门廊的东西，然后是一个有五栅门，下端是一道宽阔的拦畜沟栅。门的两边并没有栅栏向外延伸，只有这么一扇门毫无意义地悬在那里，看起来实在荒唐。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As soon as the word left her lips, order started to assert itself. The edges of the room contracted, forming definable walls, walls that were lined from floor to ceiling with bookshelves heaving with heavy tomes. A carpet materialised beneath her feet, thick and dark, made for grandeur and muffling footsteps. She had a strange sense of déjà vu as she stared around her, the image stirring up echoes of a visit to a library with Joan; cavernous and quiet and mazelike to her ten-year-old eyes. She'd got lost and been found crying beneath a desk by a kindly janitor. Was this another one of those projections of her mind, like the wasteland?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="话刚一出口，屋里的陈设自动开始显现出来。屋子的边缘开始收缩，形成了轮廓明显的墙体。书架靠墙排着，从地板一直延伸到天花板，上面摆满了大部头。一条黑色厚地毯出现在迪伦脚下，给整间屋子增添了几分华丽，也隔绝了脚步声。迪伦四下张望时有了一种似曾相识的感觉，她的脑海里浮现出有一次和琼一起去图书馆的画面。当时她才十岁，在她的眼中，那里幽深空旷，静谧沉寂，犹如洞穴或迷宫。她在里面迷了路，最后还是一个温柔和蔼的清洁工在桌子底下发现了号啕大哭的迪伦。眼前的景象难道也同荒原一样是她心像的投射吗？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The being looked far from happy, his features a mixture of concern and disapproval, but he led her around looming shelving units and past countless books until he reached a dark corner. He reached for a shelf that was empty apart from one huge tome. It was a faded green colour, with pages gilded in gold. The corners appeared worn, soft, as if a thousand fingers had lifted the cover and leafed through.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="萨利看起来非常不悦，他的表情中既有担忧也有反对，然而他还是领她绕过了一排排高耸的书架，经过了无数的册子，来到一个黑暗的角落。那里的一个书架上除了一卷大书外空空如也。他伸手把书取下来，绿色的封面已经褪色，书页上镀着一层金，边角看起来软塌塌、烂兮兮的，好像已经被好几千只手指翻动过。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Here is your ferryman's book," Caeli told her, laying it down on an empty table. "May I ask what it is you are looking for?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Dylan didn't reply, not entirely sure of the answer herself. Instead she reached out and lifted the front cover to reveal a ledger. Entry upon entry filled the page. Row after row of souls penned in with a neat hand. There was a name, an age, and a date on every line. Not their birth date, Dylan realised with a shock. It was the day they had died.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦没有回答，她也不确定自己要找什么。但她还是伸手打开了封面，里面像账本一样，每一页都密密麻麻地记满了。一行又一行的灵魂都用整齐的字体登记在册。每一行上面有他们的名字、年纪，还有一个日期。迪伦有些惊诧地发现，那不是他们的生日，而是他们的死期。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Wordlessly, Dylan flicked through the pages. Name after name after name. Hundreds. Thousands. Countless souls who owed their continued existence to Tristan. And she was just one name amongst that sea. Grabbing a thick chunk, she waded through the book until she came to blank paper. Working backwards, she found the final entry. Hers. It was bizarre, looking at her name written in a more elegant script than she could have ever managed. Was this Tristan's handwriting? No, it couldn't be. Next to it had been entered the date she'd taken the train. She touched her finger to the next blank line and wondered what name would grace the space.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她沉默地翻动着册子。一个又一个名字从眼前划过，成百上千、成千上万，这无数的灵魂多亏了崔斯坦才得以延续，而她只是沧海一粟而已。她抓着沉沉的书册，吃力地从头翻到尾，一直看到最后的空白页，然后又翻回来，找到最后一条记录，是她的。迪伦看着自己的名字以她难以想象的娟秀字体写在上面，感觉有些古怪。这会是崔斯坦写的吗？名字旁边写着她乘车的日期。她的手指抚过下一行空白，不知谁的名字将会被列在其中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan sighed and went back to flipping through the book, opening it to a page at random. She didn't want to think about Tristan ferrying another soul. He was her ferryman. Hers.

If Dylan looked, would she find the little boy in here, the one who'd died of cancer, that Tristan had dropped running from the demons? She opened her mouth to ask, but Caeli turned his head and fixed her with a dazzling smile that halted her. "Why are you interested in this book? If you tell me, I can help you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那个灵魂现在不在这儿。”他回答道，还是没看迪伦。不在？他们就是那些被恶鬼捉住的灵魂吗？如果让她来查找，她能在这儿找到那个死于癌症的小男孩吗？那个被崔斯坦不小心落在了恶魔手里的小男孩。她张着嘴想问，但萨利转过头，带着灿烂的笑容注视着她，让她欲言又止，“为什么你对这本册子那么感兴趣呢？说出来的话，我会帮你的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

That hadn't been why she'd asked to see the book, but the idea had just popped into her head and she knew at once that, subconsciously at least, that had been her plan all along.
