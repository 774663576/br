<div class="line_en">Philip went up to London a couple of days before the session began in order to find himself rooms. He hunted about the streets that led out of the Westminster Bridge Road, but their dinginess was distasteful to him; and at last he found one in Kennington which had a quiet and old-world air. It reminded one a little of the London which Thackeray knew on that side of the river, and in the Kennington Road, through which the great barouche of the Newcomes must have passed as it drove the family to the West of London, the plane-trees were bursting into leaf. The houses in the street which Philip fixed upon were two-storied, and in most of the windows was a notice to state that lodgings were to let. He knocked at one which announced that the lodgings were unfurnished, and was shown by an austere, silent woman four very small rooms, in one of which there was a kitchen range and a sink. The rent was nine shillings a week. Philip did not want so many rooms, but the rent was low and he wished to settle down at once. He asked the landlady if she could keep the place clean for him and cook his breakfast, but she replied that she had enough work to do without that; and he was pleased rather than otherwise because she intimated that she wished to have nothing more to do with him than to receive his rent. She told him that, if he inquired at the grocer's round the corner, which was also a post office, he might hear of a woman who would `do' for him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip had a little furniture which he had gathered as he went along, an arm-chair that he had bought in Paris, and a table, a few drawings, and the small Persian rug which Cronshaw had given him. His uncle had offered a fold-up bed for which, now that he no longer let his house in August, he had no further use; and by spending another ten pounds Philip bought himself whatever else was essential. He spent ten shillings on putting a corn-coloured paper in the room he was making his parlour; and he hung on the walls a sketch which Lawson had given him of the Quai des Grands Augustins, and the photograph of the Odalisque by Ingres and Manet's Olympia which in Paris had been the objects of his contemplation while he shaved. To remind himself that he too had once been engaged in the practice of art, he put up a charcoal drawing of the young Spaniard Miguel Ajuria: it was the best thing he had ever done, a nude standing with clenched hands, his feet gripping the floor with a peculiar force, and on his face that air of determination which had been so impressive; and though Philip after the long interval saw very well the defects of his work its associations made him look upon it with tolerance. He wondered what had happened to Miguel. There is nothing so terrible as the pursuit of art by those who have no talent. Perhaps, worn out by exposure, starvation, disease, he had found an end in some hospital, or in an access of despair had sought death in the turbid Seine; but perhaps with his Southern instability he had given up the struggle of his own accord, and now, a clerk in some office in Madrid, turned his fervent rhetoric to politics and bull-fighting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普的几件家具都是他这些年东奔西跑慢慢集起来的，从巴黎买的扶手椅、一张桌子、几幅画和克朗肖给他的一块波斯地毯。伯伯已经在八月的时候把房子赁出去了，家里的折叠床没了用处，干脆送给了他。又另花了十英镑，把其他该置办的东西都买齐了。他用十先令把一间房子贴上了淡黄色的墙纸，预备用它做客厅，还在墙上挂了劳森给他的素描画《大奥古斯丁码头》、安格尔的《大宫女》和马奈的《奥林匹亚》的画片。当时在巴黎的时候，他曾把这两幅画贴在洗手架旁，边刮胡子边看着它们沉思一番。为了不忘自己曾一度投身艺海的经历，他把给那个叫米盖尔·阿胡利亚的西班牙人画的炭笔肖像也挂了起来。这是他最好的作品，画面里一个赤裸的男人握拳而站，双脚好像被一种神奇的力量牢牢钉在地上，脸上的表情坚毅，让人过目难忘。尽管过了这么久，他已经能很清楚地看出画上的缺陷瑕疵，但它所带来的回忆和联想还是让他能以宽容之心看待这幅作品。他想知道米盖尔现在过得怎么样了。没有天赋可言，却偏偏固执地要吃艺术这碗饭，没有什么比这更可怕的了。也许在饱尝了风吹日晒、饥寒交迫、病痛缠身的滋味后，他已经在医院了结了自己悲惨的一生。或者一时想不开，绝望过头，跳进了浊浪翻涌的塞纳河。但也有另一种可能：这个来自欧洲南部的小伙子像那个地区的人一样，天生没有长性，早早放弃了奋斗，已经回马德里成了当地一家事务所的小职员，把他谈论艺术的那条三寸不烂之舌用在滔滔不绝地大侃政治和斗牛比赛上了。">查看中文翻译</div>

He would have invited the Scotch stockbroker too, but he had only three chairs, and thus could entertain only a definite number of guests. Lawson was aware that through him Philip had become very friendly with Norah Nesbit and now remarked that he had run across her a few days before.</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip changed the conversation, but he kept thinking of her, and after an interval, when the three of them were talking of something else, he asked suddenly:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普换了个话题，可脑子里还是一直想着她。过了一会儿，三个人已经谈起了别的事儿，他却忽然插嘴说：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip had thought of Norah often. When Mildred left him his first thought was of her, and he told himself bitterly that she would never have treated him so. His impulse was to go to her; he could depend on her pity; but he was ashamed: she had been good to him always, and he had treated her abominably.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过去的一段时间里，菲利普常常想起诺拉。米尔德里德离开的时候，他第一个想到的人就是她，心里酸酸的：诺拉是绝对不会这样对待自己的。他脑子一热，真想立马跑到她跟前，偎着她取个暖愈合心伤，可又苦于抹不开面子，思来想去只好作罢。诺拉一直都待他很好，他却在她面前表现得像只畜生一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"If I'd only had the sense to stick to her!" he said to himself, afterwards, when Lawson and Hayward had gone and he was smoking a last pipe before going to bed.</div>

<div class="line_en">He remembered the pleasant hours they had spent together in the cosy sitting-room in Vincent Square, their visits to galleries and to the play, and the charming evenings of intimate conversation. He recollected her solicitude for his welfare and her interest in all that concerned him. She had loved him with a love that was kind and lasting, there was more than sensuality in it, it was almost maternal; he had always known that it was a precious thing for which with all his soul he should thank the gods. He made up his mind to throw himself on her mercy. She must have suffered horribly, but he felt she had the greatness of heart to forgive him: she was incapable of malice. Should he write to her? No. He would break in on her suddenly and cast himself at her feet -- he knew that when the time came he would feel too shy to perform such a dramatic gesture, but that was how he liked to think of it -- and tell her that if she would take him back she might rely on him for ever. He was cured of the hateful disease from which he had suffered, he knew her worth, and now she might trust him. His imagination leaped forward to the future. He pictured himself rowing with her on the river on Sundays; he would take her to Greenwich, he had never forgotten that delightful excursion with Hayward, and the beauty of the Port of London remained a permanent treasure in his recollection; and on the warm summer afternoons they would sit in the Park together and talk: he laughed to himself as he remembered her gay chatter, which poured out like a brook bubbling over little stones, amusing, flippant, and full of character. The agony he had suffered would pass from his mind like a bad dream.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="往事历历在目：他们相依在文森特广场那间舒适惬意的客厅里；一起去画廊和剧院；多少个夜晚耳鬓厮磨、情话绵绵。她盼望着他健康快乐，为他的大事小事牵肠挂肚。对他的爱善良而绵长，这其中不仅仅包含了情欲，还有种近似母性的关爱。菲利普一直知道自己能得到这份情谊，实在是三生有幸，非要虔诚地感谢上天才行。他决心向她忏悔，任凭她的处置。想必她吃了不少苦吧。可他觉得她心肠宽宏豁达，从不记仇，一定能原谅他。是不是该给她写封信呢？不，应该忽然出现在她面前，扑到她脚下——其实若真到了那时，他一定害羞得紧，不敢表现得这么夸张，可他喜欢幻想这样的情节——只要她还肯回头，自己就愿意一辈子守护着她。那困扰着他的顽疾已经得以痊愈，他终于知道诺拉对自己有多么重要。这一次，希望她能相信自己。他的想象跃入未来：周日的泰晤士河静谧安详，他和她泛舟河上，一路驶往格林威治。和海沃德的那次意外之旅让他久久难忘，回忆里，伦敦港的恢弘壮丽也熠熠生辉，精彩非常。夏季午后，暑气未消，他们坐在公园忘情畅谈。诺拉欢快的声音如同一条晶莹的溪流，流淌在小小的碎石上，时而激起几朵水花，自由自在、痛快淋漓、个性盎然。想到这，菲利普不由笑了起来，淤积心头的痛苦也似噩梦般消散在昼光之中。">查看中文翻译</div>

He was a man of forty, clean-shaven, with long fair hair very neatly plastered down, and the reddish skin and pale, tired eyes which fair men get when their youth is passed. He had a large nose, a large mouth; the bones of his face were prominent, and he was heavily made; he was a man of more than average height, and broad-shouldered.</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip could see no shadow of embarrassment in her countenance, and he admired the use with which she carried off an encounter of which himself felt the intense awkwardness. She gave him tea. She was about to put sugar in it when he stopped her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普从她脸上看不出一丝尴尬的阴云。再见面，他觉得窘迫难安，可她却轻轻松松就应付过去了，真是令人佩服。她给他倒了杯茶，正要往里搁糖呢，他赶紧制止住她。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The conversation which Philip had interrupted went on, and presently he began to feel a little in the way. Kingsford took no particular notice of him. He talked fluently and well, not without humour, but with a slightly dogmatic manner: he was a journalist, it appeared, and had something amusing to say on every topic that was touched upon; but it exasperated Philip to find himself edged out of the conversation. He was determined to stay the visitor out. He wondered if he admired Norah. In the old days they had often talked of the men who wanted to flirt with her and had laughed at them together. Philip tried to bring back the conversation to matters which only he and Norah knew about, but each time the journalist broke in and succeeded in drawing it away to a subject upon which Philip was forced to be silent. He grew faintly angry with Norah, for she must see he was being made ridiculous; but perhaps she was inflicting this upon him as a punishment, and with this thought he regained his good humour. At last, however, the clock struck six, and Kingsford got up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="诺拉和那个男人继续聊起刚才被菲利普的到来所打断的话题，过了一会儿，菲利普觉得自己有点像个电灯泡。金斯福德旁若无人，侃侃而谈，只当他不在场。他的话挺有意思，但语气有些武断。看来他是个新闻记者，不管说到什么话题，都没他不知道的料。菲利普渐渐地插不上话了，心里又急又气，决心奉陪到底，非要先把这位客人磨走。不知道他是不是看上诺拉了。曾经他经常和诺拉一起嘲笑那些和她搭讪调情的男人。菲利普想聊些只有他和诺拉知道的话题，可那位记者每每都能搭上话，顺利地把话茬引开，让菲利普不得不闭嘴了事。他有点生诺拉的气，她肯定能看出他受到奚落，处境尴尬，可说不定也把这当作对他的惩罚呢。这么一想，他的火气就消了不少。最后，时钟敲响了六点，金斯福德站起身来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She looked at him steadily. She did not answer. He was losing his head; he seemed to have come on an errand of which he was only now realising the outrageousness. She did not help him, and he could only blurt out bluntly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她沉沉看着他，没有说话。菲利普觉得自己像是到这儿来完成一件任务，只是到了现在才忽然意识到这事的荒谬。诺拉迟迟不说话，他只好硬着头皮直截了当地问出了那句话：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then impetuously he told her that Mildred had left him and that his unhappiness had been so great that he almost killed himself. He told her of all that had happened between them, of the birth of the child, and of the meeting with Griffiths, of his folly and his trust and his immense deception. He told her how often he had thought of her kindness and of her love, and how bitterly he had regretted throwing it away: he had only been happy when he was with her, and he knew now how great was her worth. His voice was hoarse with emotion. Sometimes he was so ashamed of what he was saying that he spoke with his eyes fixed on the ground. His face was distorted with pain, and yet he felt it a strange relief to speak. At last he finished. He flung himself back in his chair, exhausted, and waited. He had concealed nothing, and even, in his self-abasement, he had striven to make himself more despicable than he had really been. He was surprised that she did not speak, and at last he raised his eyes. She was not looking at him. Her face was quite white, and she seemed to be lost in thought.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他迫不及待地告诉她，米尔德里德扔下他跑了，他差点儿没熬过来，一死了之。他把所有事儿一五一十地跟诺拉道来：孩子的出生，和格里菲斯的会面，他有多傻多相信他们，又受到了多大的欺骗。他常常想到她的好、她的爱，而自己竟然抛弃了这一切，实在追悔莫及。只有在她身边时，他才会感到幸福，她对自己是多么重要啊。他的声音激动得有点嘶哑。不时，他为自己说出的话深感羞耻，不敢看向她的眼睛，只好低头盯着地板。他的表情因痛苦而扭曲，可把这些话都说完，心里倒像是落下一块大石头。说完，他往椅背一靠，口干舌燥，等着诺拉的反应。他一点也没有遮掩，甚至把自己说得比实际更可鄙，更下作。诺拉依然不作声，这让他有点发毛。她甚至没有看他，只是脸色惨白，好像陷入了沉思。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'm sorry, I couldn't stop you… I met him soon after you"-- she seemed to search for an expression that should not wound him --"told me your friend had come back. I was very wretched for a bit, he was extremely kind to me. He knew someone had made me suffer, of course he doesn't know it was you, and I don't know what I should have done without him. And suddenly I felt I couldn't go on working, working, working; I was so tired, I felt so ill. I told him about my husband. He offered to give me the money to get my divorce if I would marry him as soon as I could. He had a very good job, and it wouldn't be necessary for me to do anything unless I wanted to. He was so fond of me and so anxious to take care of me. I was awfully touched. And now I'm very, very fond of him."</div>

<div class="line_en">He walked slowly away from her house. After all she was right when she said he had never loved her. He was disappointed, irritated even, but his vanity was more affected than his heart. He knew that himself. And presently he grew conscious that the gods had played a very good practical joke on him, and he laughed at himself mirthlessly. It is not very comfortable to have the gift of being amused at one's own absurdity.</div>
