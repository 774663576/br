<div class="line_en">Her hair was down and wild, wine-red even in this light, and her mouth was slightly open. Strawberry girl. He tried again to remember what he'd thought the first time he saw her. He tried to remember how this happened -- how she went from someone he'd never met to the only one who mattered.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他解开安全带，也帮埃莉诺解开，把她拥入怀中，脸靠着她的头。她闻起来就像昨夜。汗水的味道。甜蜜的味道。羚羊轿车的味道。他对着埃莉诺的头发啜泣，然后沉沉睡去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Park stayed awake for another hour or so, fueled by Coke and hurt feelings. Then the wreck of the night caught up with him. There wasn't a rest stop around, so he pulled off on a county road, onto the gravel that passed as a shoulder.</div>

Eleanor had never dreamed anything as nice as this, as nice as Park, sleepy-soft and warm… Warm through. Someday, she thought, somebody's going to wake up to this every morning.</div>

<div class="line_en">The sun was just below the horizon, and the inside of the truck was bluey pink. Eleanor kissed Park's new face -- just under his eye, not quite on his nose. He stirred, and she felt every part of him shift against her. She ran the end of her nose along his brow and kissed his lashes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="太阳还没升起，卡车内一片粉蓝。埃莉诺亲吻帕克的眼睛下方，而不是鼻梁。帕克动了一下，她能感觉他所有细微的小动作。她用鼻尖碰触他的眉毛，亲吻他的睫毛。">查看中文翻译</div>
