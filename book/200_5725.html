<div class="line_en">They followed Professor McGonagall past the silent figures of Neville, Dean and Seamus, out of the dormitory down the spiral stairs into the common room, through the portrait hole and off along the Fat Lady's moonlit corridor. Harry felt as though the panic inside him might spill over at any moment; he wanted to run, to yell for Dumbledore; Mr. Weasley was bleeding as they walked along so sedately and what if those fangs (Harry tried hard not to think "my fangs") had been poisonous? They passed Mrs. Norris, who turned her lamplike eyes upon them and hissed faintly but Professor McGonagall said, "Shoo!" Mrs. Norris slunk away into the shadows, and in a few minutes they had reached the stone gargoyle guarding the entrance to Dumbledore s office.</div>

<div class="line_en">The room was in half-darkness; the strange silver instruments standing on tables were silent and still rather than whirring and emitting puffs of smoke as they usually did; the portraits of old headmasters and headmistresses covering the walls were all snoozing in their frames. Behind the door, a magnificent red and gold bird the size of a swan dozed on its perch with its head under its wing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="屋里半明半暗，桌上那些古怪的银制仪器静静地待着，而不是像往常那样嗡嗡转动，吐出阵阵烟雾。墙上历届校长的肖像都在镜框里鼾睡。门后面，一只个头像天鹅，羽毛金红相间，美丽非凡的大鸟在栖木上打瞌睡，头藏在翅膀下面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Professor McGonagall rapped three times with the griffin knocker and the voices ceased abruptly as though someone had switched them all off. The door opened of its own accord and Professor McGonagall led Harry and Ron inside.</div>

<div class="line_en">The gargoyle sprang to life and leapt aside; the wall behind it split in two to reveal a stone staircase that was moving continually upwards like a spiral escalator. The three of them stepped on to the moving stairs; the wall closed behind them with a thud and they were moving upwards in tight circles until they reached the highly polished oak door with the brass knocker shaped like a griffin.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dumbledore was sitting in a high-backed chair behind his desk; he leaned forward into the pool of candlelight illuminating the papers laid out before him. He was wearing a magnificently embroidered purple and gold dressing gown over a snowy white nightshirt, but seemed wide-awake, his penetrating light blue eyes fixed intently upon Professor McGonagall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓布利多坐在他书桌后的高背椅上，凑在蜡烛前看文件。他穿着雪白的睡衣，外罩一件紫底镶金的便袍，但看上去精神抖擞，锐利的蓝眼睛紧盯着麦格教授。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I… well, I was asleep…" said Harry and, even in his terror and his desperation to make Dumbledore understand, he felt slightly irritated that the Headmaster was not looking at him, but examining his own interlocked fingers. "But it wasn't an ordinary dream… it was real… I saw it happen…" He took a deep breath, "Ron's dad -- Mr. Weasley -- has been attacked by a giant snake."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我…嗯，我是在睡觉…”哈利说，虽在恐怖和急切中，他还是有点气恼校长没有看他，而是望着自己交叉的十指，“可这不是一般的梦…它是真的…我看到它发生了…”他深深吸了口气，“罗恩的爸爸——韦斯莱先生——被一条大蛇咬了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The words seemed to reverberate in the air after he had said them, sounding slightly ridiculous, even comic. There was a pause in which Dumbledore leaned back and stared meditatively at the ceiling. Ron looked from Harry to Dumbledore, white-faced and shocked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他说完后，这些话似乎在空气中回响着，有点荒唐，甚至可笑。邓布利多向后一靠，凝视着天花板。罗恩望望哈利，又望望邓布利多，面色苍白而震惊。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你们听见了吗？”邓布利多问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But Dumbledore stood up, so quickly it made Harry jump, and addressed one of the old portraits hanging very near the ceiling. "Everard?" he said sharply. "And you too, Dilys!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但邓布利多猛地站起来，把哈利吓了一跳。他对离天花板很近的一幅旧画像说：“埃弗尔？”他厉声说，“还有你，戴丽丝！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A sallow-faced wizard with a short black fringe and an elderly witch with long silver ringlets in the frame beside him, both of whom seemed to have been in the deepest of sleeps, opened their eyes immediately.</div>

<div class="line_en">Both nodded and moved sideways out of their frames, but instead of emerging in neighbouring pictures (as usually happened at Hogwarts) neither reappeared. One frames now contained nothing but a backdrop of dark curtain, the other a handsome leather armchair. Harry noticed that many of the other headmasters and mistresses on the walls, though snoring and drooling most convincingly, kept sneaking peeks at him from under their eyelids, and he suddenly understood who had been talking when they had knocked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两位巫师点点头从侧面出了画框，但没有出现在旁边的画框里（像在霍格沃茨经常发生的那样），而是消失不见了。一个画框里只剩下了深色的帘子，另一个剩下了一张漂亮的皮椅。哈利注意到墙上其他许多老校长虽然逼真地打着呼噜，流着口水，却从眼皮底下偷偷地看他，他突然明白了刚才敲门时是谁在说话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Everard and Dilys were two of Hogwartss most celebrated Heads," Dumbledore said, now sweeping around Harry, Ron and Professor McGonagall to approach the magnificent sleeping bird on his perch beside the door. "Their renown is such that both have portraits hanging in other important wizarding institutions. As they are free to move between their own portraits, they can tell us what may be happening elsewhere…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“埃弗尔和戴丽丝是霍格沃茨鼎鼎有名的两位校长，”邓布利多快步从哈利、罗恩和麦张教授身旁走到门边睡觉的美丽大鸟跟前，“其他重要的巫师机构也挂有他们的肖像。他们能在自己的肖像之间随意来去，所以能告诉我们别处发生的事情…”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Professor McGonagall pulled her wand from the pocket of her dressing gown and waved it; three chairs appeared out of thin air, straight-backed and wooden, quite unlike the comfortable chintz armchairs that Dumbledore had conjured up at Harry's hearing. Harry sat down, watching Dumbledore over his shoulder. Dumbledore was now stroking Fawkes's plumed golden head with one finger. The phoenix awoke immediately. He stretched his beautiful head high and observed Dumbledore through bright, dark eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="麦格教授从兜里抽出魔杖，挥了一下，变出三把椅子，是直背的木椅，与哈利受审时邓布利多变出的软椅不同。哈利坐下来，回头看邓布利多，他用一根手指抚摸着福克斯头上的金色羽毛，凤凰立刻醒了过来，仰起美丽的头颈，用明亮的黑眼睛望着他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dumbledore now swooped down upon one of the fragile silver instruments whose function Harry had never known, carried it over to his desk, sat down facing them again and tapped it gently with the tip of his wand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓布利多现在快步走到一台精巧的银仪器前，哈利一直不知道这些银仪器的用途。邓布利多把那台仪器搬到书桌上，重新面对他们坐下，用魔杖轻轻敲打着它。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我们需要一点警报。”邓布利多轻轻对它说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Naturally, naturally," murmured Dumbledore apparently to himself, still observing the stream of smoke without the slightest sign of surprise. "But in essence divided?"</div>

<div class="line_en">The instrument tinkled into life at once with rhythmic clinking noises. Tiny puffs of pale green smoke issued from the minuscule silver tube at the top. Dumbledore watched the smoke closely, his brow furrowed. After a few seconds, the tiny puffs became a steady stream of smoke that thickened and coiled in the air… a serpent's head grew out of the end of it, opening its mouth wide. Harry wondered whether the instrument was confirming his story: he looked eagerly at Dumbledore for a sign that he was right, but Dumbledore did not look up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="仪器立刻运转起来，发出有节奏的丁当声，顶部的小银管喷出一缕缕淡绿色的轻烟，在空气中汇聚缭绕…邓布利多专注地望着轻烟，眉头轻锁。几秒钟后，几缕轻烟变成一股稳定的烟雾，越来越浓，在空气中盘旋…顶端化成一个蛇头，蛇嘴大张着。哈利想知道仪器是否在证实他的描述，他热切地看着邓布利多，想得到肯定的表示，但校长没有抬头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dumbledore replaced the instrument on its spindly little table. Harry saw many of the old headmasters in the portraits follow him with their eyes, then, realising that Harry was watching them, hastily pretend to be sleeping again. Harry wanted to ask what the strange silver instrument was for, but before he could do so, there was a shout from the top of the wall to their right; the wizard called Everard had reappeared in his portrait., panting slightly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓布利多把仪器放回细长的小桌上。哈利看到画像中许多老校长在窥视，他们发现哈利在看着他们，赶忙又假装睡着了。哈利正想问那奇怪的银仪器是干什么的，右边墙上一声喊叫，那个叫埃弗尔的男巫已经回到画框中，有点气喘吁吁。">查看中文翻译</div>

Anyway, they carried him up a few minutes later. He doesn't look good, he's covered in blood, I ran along to Elfrida Cragg's portrait to get a good view as they left --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我一直喊到有人跑来，”男巫用帘子擦着额头说，“说我听到楼下有东西在动——他们半信半疑，但还是下去看了——你知道下面没有画像可以瞭望。总之，几分钟后他们把他抬了上来。他看上去不妙，浑身是血，我跑到艾芙丽达·克拉格的画像中去好好看了一眼——”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry could make neither head nor tail of this question. The smoke serpent, however, split itself instantly into two snakes, both coiling and undulating in the dark air. With a look of grim satisfaction, Dumbledore gave the instrument another gentle tap with his wand: the clinking noise slowed and died and the smoke serpents grew faint, became a formless haze and vanished.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利完全摸不着头脑，但烟蛇马上分成了两条，在昏暗的空气中盘旋、扭动。邓布利多带着严峻而满意的神情，又用魔杖轻轻敲了敲仪器。丁当声减慢停止了，烟蛇渐渐淡去，化成无形的烟雾消失了。">查看中文翻译</div>

Kreacher was disappearing through the door to the hall, looking back at them malevolently as he hitched up his loincloth; Sirius was hurrying towards them all, looking anxious.

The room was scarcely less quiet than the street outside, for many of the patients were making very peculiar noises: a sweaty-faced witch in the centre of the front row, who was fanning herself vigorously with a copy of the Daily Prophet, kept letting off a high-pitched whistle as steam came pouring out of her mouth; a grubby-looking warlock in the corner clanged like a bell every time he moved and, with each clang, his head vibrated horribly so that he had to seize himself by the ears to hold it steady.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Dumbledore seemed worried about Harry when I spoke to him this morning," whispered Mrs Weasley.</div>

No, I reckon he's trying to get a clearer picture of what he's facing and if Arthur hadn't been there the beast would've had a lot more time to look around. So, Potter says he saw it all happen?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我想他是放它出来侦察的，”穆迪的粗嗓门说，“因为他至今没什么进展，对吧？我估计他是想探探情况，如果亚瑟不在那儿，那畜生就会有时间多看看。波特说他看到了全过程？”">查看中文翻译</div>
