<div class="line_en">Once, when she was just a little girl, a wandering singer had stayed with them at Winterfell for half a year. An old man he was, with white hair and windburnt cheeks, but he sang of knights and quests and ladies fair, and Sansa had cried bitter tears when he left them, and begged her father not to let him go. "The man has played us every song he knows thrice over," Lord Eddard told her gently. "I cannot keep him here against his will. You need not weep, though. I promise you, other singers will come."</div>

<div class="line_en">They hadn't, though, not for a year or more. Sansa had prayed to the Seven in their sept and old gods of the heart tree, asking them to bring the old man back, or better still to send another singer, young and handsome. But the gods never answered, and the halls of Winterfell stayed silent. But that was when she was a little girl, and foolish. She was a maiden now, three-and-ten and flowered. All her nights were full of song, and by day she prayed for silence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="结果没有歌手来，教她足足等了一年多。其间，珊莎在圣堂里向七神祷告，在心树下对旧神祈求，祈求他们让那个老人回来，或者派来别的歌手，更年轻、更英俊。但诸神毫无回应，临冬城的厅堂始终空寂沉默。那是小女孩的念头，愚蠢的念头，现下她是女人了，年方十三，已经有了月事。每个夜晚，她都在歌声中度过，而每个白天，她都祈求能得一方平静。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">If the Eyrie had been made like other castles, only rats and gaolers would have heard the dead man singing. Dungeon walls were thick enough to swallow songs and screams alike. But the sky cells had a wall of empty air, so every chord the dead man played flew free to echo off the stony shoulders of the Giant's Lance. And the songs he chose… He sang of the Dance of the Dragons, of fair Jonquil and her fool, of Jenny of Oldstones and the Prince of Dragonflies. He sang of betrayals, and murders most foul, of hanged men and bloody vengeance. He sang of grief and sadness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果鹰巢城和别的城堡一样，那么只有老鼠与狱卒听得见死人的歌唱，地牢的黑墙将吸收所有呐喊与尖叫。然而天牢的四面墙空空如也，所以死人弹奏的每一个旋律都在巨人之枪上回荡。他唱的那些歌…血龙狂舞，美丽的琼琪和她的傻子，荒石城的简妮与龙芙莱亲王。他歌唱最残忍的背叛，歌唱最冷酷的谋杀，歌唱被吊死的叛徒和血淋淋的复仇。他歌唱悲痛与哀伤。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">No matter where she went in the castle, Sansa could not escape the music. It floated up the winding tower steps, found her naked in her bath, supped with her at dusk, and stole into her bedchamber even when she latched the shutters tight. It came in on the cold thin air, and like the air, it chilled her. Though it had not snowed upon the Eyrie since the day that Lady Lysa fell, the nights had all been bitter cold.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无论位于城堡何方，她都不能自歌声中逃避。歌声爬上迂回的高塔楼梯，与赤身裸体的她一起洗浴，黄昏时同她共进晚餐，甚至当她把窄窗紧紧关闭后，仍然不依不饶地钻进卧房。它缠绕在冰冷稀薄的空气中，却比空气本身更冰冷，令她颤抖不已。虽然自莱莎夫人坠落之后山上就没下过雪，可珊莎觉得夜里实在无法忍受了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The singer's voice was strong and sweet. Sansa thought he sounded better than he ever had before, his voice richer somehow, full of pain and fear and longing. She did not understand why the gods would have given such a voice to such a wicked man. He would have taken me by force on the Fingers if Petyr had not set Ser Lothor to watch over me, she had to remind herself. And he played to drown out my cries when Aunt Lysa tried to kill me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="歌手的嗓音嘹亮而甜美，珊莎觉得他比从前任何时候都唱得更加圆润丰满，因为其中饱含痛苦、恐惧与渴望。她不明白诸神为何将如此甜美的嗓音赐给这样的恶徒。若不是培提尔要罗索爵士随身保护，我在五指半岛就会被他玷污的，她提醒自己，况且当莱莎姨妈要杀我时，他曾用歌声来掩盖罪行。">查看中文翻译</div>

Petyr Baelish, Lord of Harrenhal, Lord Paramount of the Trident, and Lord Protector of the Eyrie and the Vale of Arryn, looked up from the letter he was writing. He had written a hundred letters since Lady Lysa's fall. Sansa had seen the ravens coming and going from the rookery. "I'd sooner suffer his singing than listen to his sobbing."</div>

<div class="line_en">Sansa had met Lord Nestor Royce once before, after Petyr's wedding to her aunt. Royce was the Keeper of the Gates of the Moon, the great castle that stood at the base of the mountain and guarded the steps up to the Eyrie. The wedding party had guested with him overnight before beginning their ascent. Lord Nestor had scarce looked at her twice, but the prospect of him coming here terrified her. He was High Steward of the Vale as well, Jon Arryn's trusted liege man, and Lady Lysa's. "He won't… you won't let Lord Nestor see Marillion, will you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="培提尔与姨妈成婚之后，珊莎会过奈斯特男爵一次。罗伊斯乃月门堡的守护者——此堡位于大山之下的要害，守卫着连接鹰巢城的石阶。当初，新婚夫妇回城后第一个邀请的便是他，并将他留在城中招待了整整一夜。奈斯特男爵在席间根本没看珊莎几眼，但此刻听说他要上山，却令她倍感恐惧。毕竟，男爵身为艾林谷的大总管，是琼恩·艾林和莱莎夫人最信任的封臣。“他…您不会让他与马瑞里安对质的，是吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her horror must have shown on her face, since Petyr put down his quill. "On the contrary. I shall insist on it." He beckoned her to take the seat beside him. "We have come to an agreement, Marillion and I. Mord can be most persuasive. And if our singer disappoints us and sings a song we do not care to hear, why, you and I need only say he lies. Whom do you imagine Lord Nestor will believe?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的恐惧一定清楚明白地写在了脸上，于是培提尔搁笔道，“恰恰相反，我坚持要他前来对质，”他比个手势，示意她坐在他身边，“我们达成了协议，我和马瑞里安…总而言之呢，我可以让莫德表现得温柔些。不过若是我们的歌手令人失望，竟然唱出不协调的句子来，那么你，你和我只需指责他撒谎就是了。想想看，高贵的奈斯特大人会相信谁呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>

If not for Petyr Baelish it would have been Sansa who went spinning through a cold blue sky to stony death six hundred feet below, instead of Lysa Arryn. He is so bold. Sansa wished she had his courage. She wanted to crawl back into bed and hide beneath her blanket, to sleep and sleep. She had not slept a whole night through since Lysa Arryn's death. "Couldn't you tell Lord Nestor that I am… indisposed, or…"</div>

<div class="line_en">He saved Alayne, his daughter, a voice within her whispered. But she was Sansa too… and sometimes it seemed to her that the Lord Protector was two people as well. He was Petyr, her protector, warm and funny and gentle… but he was also Littlefinger, the lord she'd known at King's Landing, smiling slyly and stroking his beard as he whispered in Queen Cersei's ear. And Littlefinger was no friend of hers. When Joff had her beaten, the Imp defended her, not Littlefinger. When the mob sought to rape her, the Hound carried her to safety, not Littlefinger. When the Lannisters wed her to Tyrion against her will, Ser Garlan the Gallant gave her comfort, not Littlefinger. Littlefinger never lifted so much as his little finger for her.</div>

<div class="line_en">Except to get me out. He did that for me. I thought it was Ser Dontos, my poor old drunken Florian, but it was Petyr all the while. Littlefinger was only a mask he had to wear. Only sometimes Sansa found it hard to tell where the man ended and the mask began. Littlefinger and Lord Petyr looked so very much alike. She would have fled them both, perhaps, but there was nowhere for her to go. Winterfell was burned and desolate, Bran and Rickon dead and cold. Robb had been betrayed and murdered at the Twins, along with their lady mother. Tyrion had been put to death for killing Joffrey, and if she ever returned to King's Landing the queen would have her head as well. The aunt she'd hoped would keep her safe had tried to murder her instead. Her uncle Edmure was a captive of the Freys, while her great-uncle the Blackfish was under siege at Riverrun. I have no place but here, Sansa thought miserably, and no true friend but Petyr.</div>

<div class="line_en">That night the dead man sang "The Day They Hanged Black Robin," "The Mother's Tears," and "The Rains of Castamere." Then he stopped for a while, but just as Sansa began to drift off he started to play again. He sang "Six Sorrows," "Fallen Leaves," and "Alysanne." Such sad songs, she thought. When she closed her eyes she could see him in his sky cell, huddled in a corner away from the cold black sky, crouched beneath a fur with his woodharp cradled against his chest. I must not pity him, she told herself. He was vain and cruel, and soon he will be dead. She could not save him. And why should she want to? Marillion tried to rape her, and Petyr had saved her life not once but twice. Some lies you have to tell. Lies had been all that kept her alive in King's Landing. If she had not lied to Joffrey, his Kingsguard would have beat her bloody.</div>

<div class="line_en">After "Alysanne" the singer stopped again, long enough for Sansa to snatch an hour's rest. But as the first light of dawn was prying at her shutters, she heard the soft strains of "On a Misty Morn" drifting up from below, and woke at once. That was more properly a woman's song, a lament sung by a mother on the dawn after some terrible battle, as she searches amongst the dead for the body of her only son. The mother sings her grief for her dead son, Sansa thought, but Marillion grieves for his fingers, for his eyes. The words rose like arrows and pierced her in the darkness.</div>

<div class="line_en">Petyr welcomed his visitors in a black velvet doublet with grey sleeves that matched his woolen breeches and lent a certain darkness to his grey-green eyes. Maester Colemon stood beside him, his chain of many metals hanging loose about his long, skinny neck. Although the maester was much the taller of the two men, it was the Lord Protector who drew the eye. He had put away his smiles for the day, it seemed.

Though fifty silver sconces lined the walls, less than a dozen torches had been lit, so shadows danced upon the floors and pooled in every corner.
