<div class="line_en">Graduation was only a few weeks away, but I wondered if it wasn't a little foolish to sit around, weak and tasty, waiting for the next disaster.

<div class="line_en">It was always a bad day when Edward was away. Alice had foreseen nothing out of the ordinary this weekend, and so I'd insisted that he take the opportunity to go hunting with his brothers. I knew how it bored him to hunt the easy, nearby prey.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱德华不在已经够糟糕的了，爱丽丝预见到这个星期不会有什么不同寻常的事情发生，因此我坚持让他趁机和兄弟们一起去狩猎。我知道让他在附近轻而易举地狩猎令他感到厌倦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I would never admit to him how hard it was for me when he was gone -- how it brought back the abandonment nightmares. If he knew that, it would make him feel horrible and he would be afraid to ever leave me, even for the most necessary reasons. It had been like that in the beginning, when he'd first returned from Italy. His golden eyes had turned black and he'd suffered from his thirst more than it was already necessary that he suffer. So I put on a brave face and all but kicked him out the door whenever Emmett and Jasper wanted to go.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我决不会告诉他，他不在的时候我有多么难过——这会重新勾起被我抛弃的梦魇。要是他知道此事的话会感到非常难过，而且会过于担心而不会离开我的，哪怕是由于迫不得已的原因，他也会这么想的。就好像刚开始一样，那时他刚从意大利回来。他的金色眼睛变黑了，他所遭受的饥渴已经超越了他必须承受的程度。所以我故作坚强，只要看到埃美特和贾斯帕要去狩猎我都会把他踢出门。">查看中文翻译</div>

And Charlie was in an excellent mood due to Edward's absence, so I might as well enjoy that while it lasted. Alice would spend the night with me if I was pathetic enough to ask her to. And then tomorrow, Edward would be home. I would survive.</div>

<div class="line_en">For some reason -- impending mania, perhaps -- this really irritated me. Why couldn't they just play nice? Stupid with stubbornness, I kept shoving them together as if I was expecting them to suddenly give up. I could have flipped one over, but that felt like losing. Finally, exasperated at myself more than the magnets, I pulled them from the fridge and held them together with two hands. It took a little effort -- they were strong enough to put up a fight -- but I forced them to coexist side-by-side.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="由于某种原因——或许是即将来临的狂热——这可真的令我很恼火。为什么它们就不能表现好一些呢？我愚蠢而顽固，一直要把它们拼在一起，就好像我期待着它们突然会放弃不合作一样。我本来可以抽掉其中一个，但是那样感觉就像被打败了一样。最后，与其说是被冰箱贴激怒了，还不如说是被我自己激怒了，我把它们从冰箱上一把拉了下来，捏在两只手里。这需要些力气——它们强得足以承受殴打——但是我硬是把它们两个拼凑到了一起。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The last two magnets -- round black utilitarian pieces that were my favorites because they could hold ten sheets of paper to the fridge without breaking a sweat -- did not want to cooperate with my fixation.

<div class="line_cn" title="他怒气冲冲地看了我一眼，说道：“你知道我根本不在乎这些。算了，卡莱尔跟山姆说，试图让事端平静下来，接着很奇怪，因为每个人真的很快就平静下来了，就是你告诉我的那个家伙糊弄了我们的头脑。不过，即使我们知道他在做什么，我们也不能不平静下来。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Really annoying, that's how it feels. Only you can't be annoyed until afterwards." He shook his head angrily. "So Sam and the head vamp agreed that Victoria was the priority, and we started after her again. Carlisle gave us the line, so that we could follow the scent properly, but then she hit the cliffs just north of Makah country, right where the line hugs the coast for a few miles. She took off into the water again. The big one and the calm one wanted permission to cross the line to go after her, but of course we said no."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“真的很烦人，就是那种感觉，而且你要过好一阵子才能消除它。”他生气地摇了摇头，“接着山姆和那个吸血鬼的头头同意维多利亚才是我们优先考虑的目标，于是我们分头去追她。卡莱尔给我们提供了线索，这样我们可以正确地跟踪她的气味，但是那时候她已经朝马卡村北部的悬崖逃跑了，就在边界线与海滨交界的几英里的地方。那个大个子和那个让人冷静的家伙想获准越界追赶她，不过，我们当然会说不啦。”">查看中文翻译</div>
