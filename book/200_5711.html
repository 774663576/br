<div class="line_en">The walls were made of dark stone, dimly lit by torches. Empty benches rose on either side of him, but ahead, in the highest benches of all, were many shadowy figures. They had been talking in low voices, but as the heavy door swung closed behind Harry an ominous silence fell.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="四周的墙壁是用黑黑的石头砌成的，火把的光线昏暗阴森。他的两边是一排排逐渐升高的空板凳，而他的前方，在最高的几条板凳上，赫然浮现着许多黑乎乎的人影。他们刚才一直在窃窃私语，当沉重的大门在哈利身后关上时，一种不祥的沉寂笼罩下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry gasped; he could not help himself. The large dungeon he had entered was horribly familiar. He had not only seen it before, he had been here before. This was the place he had visited inside Dumbledore's Pensieve, the place where he had watched the Lestranges sentenced to life imprisonment in Azkaban.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利倒抽了一口冷气，他无法控制自己。他走进的这间幽深的暗室对他来说太熟悉了，令他胆战心惊。他不仅以前见过它，而且曾经还来过这里。这就是他在邓布利多的冥想盆里见过的地方，他就是在这里目睹了莱斯特兰奇夫妇被判在阿兹卡班终身监禁。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry dropped his gaze to the chair in the centre of the room, the arms of which were covered in chains. He had seen those chains spring to life and bind whoever sat between them. His footsteps echoed loudly as he walked across the stone floor. When he sat gingerly on the edge of the chair the chains clinked threateningly, but did not bind him. Feeling rather sick, he looked up at the people seated at the bench above.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利垂下目光，望着房间中央的那把椅子，椅子的扶手上是左一道右一道的铁链。他曾经见过这些铁链突然蹿起来，把坐在中间的人捆得结结实实。他的双脚走过石头地面，发出响亮的回音。他小心翼翼地坐在椅子边上，链条凶险地丁丁当当响了起来，但并没有把他捆住。哈利觉得一阵眩晕恶心，抬头望了望坐在上面板凳上的那些人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the very middle of the front row sat Cornelius Fudge, the Minister for Magic. Fudge was a portly man who often sported a lime-green bowler hat, though today he had dispensed with it; he had dispensed too with the indulgent smile he had once worn when he spoke to Harry. A broad, square-jawed witch with very short grey hair sat on Fudges left; she wore a monocle and looked forbidding. On Fudges right was another witch, but she was sitting so far back on the bench that her face was in shadow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在前面一排板凳的正中间，坐着魔法部部长康奈利福吉。福吉是一个大胖子，经常戴一顶暗黄绿色的圆顶高帽，不过今天他没有戴。另外，以前他对哈利说话时脸上总带着的那种慈祥的微笑，今天也消失不见了。福吉的左边坐着一个宽身材、方下巴的女巫，灰色的头发剪得短短的，戴着一副单片眼镜，脸上的表情令人生畏。福吉的右边坐着另一个女巫，但她在板凳上坐得太靠后了，她的脸笼罩在阴影中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Very well," said Fudge. "The accused being present -- finally -- let us begin. Are you ready?" he called down the row.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“很好，”福吉说，“被告终于到场了，我们开始吧。你准备好了吗？”他朝板凳那头大声问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There were about fifty of them, all, as far as he could see, wearing plum-coloured robes with an elaborately worked silver "W" on the left-hand side of the chest and all staring down their noses at him, some with very austere expressions, others looks of frank curiosity.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes, sir," said an eager voice Harry knew. Ron's brother Percy was sitting at the very end of the front bench. Harry looked at Percy, expecting some sign of recognition from him, but none came. Percy's eyes, behind his horn-rimmed glasses, were fixed on his parchment, a quill poised in his hand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，先生。”一个哈利熟悉的声音急切地说道。罗恩的哥哥珀西坐在前排板凳的最边上。哈利望着珀西，以为他会显露出认识自己的表情，但是他脸上什么表情也没有。珀西那双藏在角质架眼镜后面的眼睛正专注地盯着面前的羊皮纸，一只羽毛笔拿在手里准备写字。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="哈利一看见邓布利多，内心就升起一股强烈的情感，让他感到踏实，充满了希望，就像凤凰福克斯歌声曾经带给他的感觉一样。他想与邓布利多对一下目光，但邓布利多没有朝他这边看，而是继续抬跟望着显然惊慌失措的福吉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Not to worry, not to worry," said Dumbledore pleasantly; he took out his wand, gave it a little flick, and a squashy chintz armchair appeared out of nowhere next to Harry. Dumbledore sat down, put the tips of his long fingers together and surveyed Fudge over them with an expression of polite interest. The Wizengamot was still muttering and fidgeting restlessly; only when Fudge spoke again did they settle down.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不劳费心，不劳费心。”邓布利多温文尔雅地说。他抽出魔杖，轻轻抖动了一下，一把柔软的磨光印花棉布扶手椅凭空出现在哈利旁边。邓布利多坐了下来，长长的手指尖对接在一起，目光从那上面望着福吉，脸上带着彬彬有礼、饶有兴趣的表情！。威森加摩的成员仍然在交头接耳，一个个坐立不安。后来福吉又开口说话时，他们才安静下来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“可是，你们肯定会不厌其烦地听一个证人的证词，因为草率行事会造成严重的误判。”邓布利多说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Of course you are," said Dumbledore courteously. "Then we are in agreement that Harry's use of the Patronus Charm in these circumstances falls precisely into the category of exceptional circumstances the clause describes?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然是这样，”邓布利多不卑不亢地说，“那么我们一致同意哈利使用呼神护卫咒时的情形正好符合第七条里所描述的特殊情况的范畴喽？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我——不是——我没有时间听家养小精灵胡扯！而且，不光这一件事——他还把他姑妈吹得膨胀起来，天哪！”福吉大声嚷道，一拳砸在法官的长凳上，把一瓶墨水打翻了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And you very kindly did not press charges on that occasion, accepting, I presume, that even the best wizards cannot always control their emotions," said Dumbledore calmly, as Fudge attempted to scrub the ink off his notes.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“可是，魔法部无权因霍格沃茨学生在校的不端行为而惩罚他们，因此，哈利在那里的所作所为与本案毫无关系。”邓布利多说，还是那样谦和有礼，但此时他的话里透着一种冷峻。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The Ministry does not have the power to expel Hogwarts students, Cornelius, as I reminded you on the night of the second of August," said Dumbledore. "Nor does it have the right to confiscate wands until charges have been successfully proven, again, as I reminded you on the night of the second of August, in your admirable haste to ensure that the law is upheld, you appear, inadvertently I am sure, to have overlooked a few laws yourself."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“魔法部没有权利开除霍格沃茨的学生，康奈利，这一点我已在8月2日晚上就提醒过你。”邓布利多说，“魔法部也没有权利没收魔杖，除非那些指控被证明确实成立，这一点，我也在8月2日晚上提醒过你。你急于确保法律得到维护的态度是值得称道的，但你自己似乎，我相信是出于一时疏忽，忽略了几条法律。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Of course they can," said Dumbledore, inclining his head. "And you certainly seem to be making many changes, Cornelius. Why, in the few short weeks since I was asked to leave the Wizengamot, it has already become the practice to hold a full criminal trial to deal with a simple matter of underage magic!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然是这样，”邓布利多欠了欠身说，“看样子你无疑正在做许多修改，康奈利。是啊，我被请出威森加摩只有短短几个星期，一件未成年人使用魔法的区区小事现在居然要动用正式的刑事法庭来审理了！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A few of the wizards above them shifted uncomfortably in their seats. Fudge turned a slightly deeper shade of puce. The toadlike witch on his right, however, merely gazed at Dumbledore, her face quite expressionless.</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry looked at his feet. His heart, which seemed to have swollen to an unnatural size, was thumping loudly under his ribs. He had expected the hearing to last longer than this. He was not at all sure that he had made a good impression. He had not really said very much. He ought to have explained more fully about the dementors, about how he had fallen over, about how both he and Dudley had nearly been kissed…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利望着自己的脚尖。他的心似乎膨胀得很大很大，在肋骨下咚咚地狂跳着。他原来以为审讯的时间会更长一些。他不知道自己是否给人留下了较好的印象。实际上他并没有说几句话。他应该更详细地说一说摄魂怪，说一说他怎么摔倒在地，说一说他和达力怎么差点被摄魂怪吻了…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"As far as I am aware," Dumbledore continued, "there is no law yet in place that says this court's job is to punish Harry for every bit of magic he has ever performed. He has been charged with a specific offence and he has presented his defence. All he and I can do now is to await your verdict."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“据我所知，”邓布利多继续说道，“迄今还没有哪条法律说明，这次开庭要为哈利有生以来施过的每一个魔法而惩罚他。他是因一个特定的行为而受到指控的，并已为自己进行了辩护。他和我目前所能做的就是等候你们的裁决！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dumbledore put his fingertips together again and said no more. Fudge glared at him, evidently incensed. Harry glanced sideways at Dumbledore, seeking reassurance; he was not at all sure that Dumbledore was right in telling the Wizengamot, in effect, that it was about time they made a decision. Again, however, Dumbledore seemed oblivious to Harry's attempt to catch his eye. He continued to look up at the benches where the entire Wizengamot had fallen into urgent, whispered conversations.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓布利多又把十个指尖对接在一起，不再说话了。福吉狠狠地瞪着他，一副老羞成怒的样子。哈利侧眼望望邓布利多，想从他那里得到一些安慰。邓布利多告诉威森加摩现在就做出裁决，这样做合适不合适呢，他一点把握也没有。可是，邓布利多又一次没有理睬哈利希望与他的目光进行交流的愿望。他继续注视着上面那些正在紧张地窃窃私语的威森加摩的全体成员。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="哈利猛地把头抬起来。一只只手举了起来，数量不少…超过了半数！他呼吸急促起来，想好好数一数，可是没等他数完，博恩斯女士就说：“那些人赞成罪行成立的？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Fudge raised his hand; so did half a dozen others, including the witch on his right and the heavily-moustached wizard and the frizzy-haired witch in the second row.</div>

<div class="line_en">Fudge glanced around at them all, looking as though there was something large stuck in his throat, then lowered his own hand. He took two deep breaths and said, in a voice distorted by suppressed rage, "Very well, very well… cleared of all charges."</div>
