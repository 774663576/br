<div class="line_en">The compliment made Ser Lancel sulky; perhaps he thought he was being mocked. It seemed to Tyrion that the lad had grown three inches since being knighted. Lancel had thick sandy hair, green Lannister eyes, and a line of soft blond fuzz on his upper lip. At sixteen, he was cursed with all the certainty of youth, unleavened by any trace of humor or self doubt, and wed to the arrogance that came so naturally to those born blond and strong and handsome. His recent elevation had only made him worse. "Did Her Grace send for you?" the boy demanded.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ser Meryn Trant guarded the queen's door this night. His muttered "My lord" struck Tyrion as a tad grudging, but he opened the door nonetheless. The song broke off abruptly as he strode into his sister's bedchamber.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="今晚在太后卧室门外把守的是马林·特兰爵士。提利昂的出现让他有些为难，只好含含糊糊地说声“大人”，活像个心怀不忿的孩子，随后开了门。他大步跨入姐姐的卧室，歌声嘎然而止。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Through the door came the soft sound of the high harp, mingled with a trilling of pipes. The singer's voice was muffled by the thick walls, yet Tyrion knew the verse. I loved a maid as fair as summer, he remembered, with sunlight in her hair…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="轻柔的竖琴声透过门扉传来，混合着笛子的颤音。虽然歌手的嗓门隔着厚厚的门板听不真切，但歌词却是提利昂再熟悉也不过的：我爱上一位美如夏日的姑娘，阳光照在她的秀发…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Cersei was reclining on a pile of cushions. Her feet were bare, her golden hair artfully tousled, her robe a green-and-gold samite that caught the light of the candles and shimmered as she looked up.

<div class="line_cn" title="瑟曦怀疑地看着他，“你来这儿别说是为了那些乞丐帮的家伙，省省吧，提利昂，少来烦我。我不能让他们在大街上公然散播肮脏的谋逆邪说，就让他们在黑牢里互相说教去。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"One even dared to say that the gods were punishing us because Jaime murdered the rightful king," Cersei declared. "It will not be borne, Tyrion.

<div class="line_en">"And so he did." Tyrion had been annoyed when the red cloaks had dragged a half dozen of the scabrous prophets down to the dungeons without consulting him, but they were not important enough to battle over. "No doubt we will all be better off for a little quiet in the streets. That is not why I came. I have tidings I know you will be anxious to hear, sweet sister, but they are best spoken of privily."</div>

<div class="line_en">The Iron Throne of Aegon the Conqueror was a tangle of nasty barbs and jagged metal teeth waiting for any fool who tried to sit too comfortably, and the steps made his stunted legs cramp as he climbed up to it, all too aware of what an absurd spectacle he must be. Yet there was one thing to be said for it. It was high.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was the next morning as he broke his fast that her messenger arrived. The queen was indisposed and would not be able to leave her chambers. Not able to leave her privy, more like. Tyrion made the proper sympathetic noises and sent word to Cersei to rest easy, he would treat with Ser Cleos as they'd planned.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天早餐时她遣人过来，宣布自己身体不适，无法离开房间。应该是无法离开厕所吧。提利昂适度表示了一些同情之意，并叫来人回话给瑟曦，请她安心休养，他会照预订计划来应付克里奥爵士。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Lannister guardsmen stood silent in their crimson cloaks and lion-crested halfhelms. Ser Jacelyn's gold cloaks faced them across the hall. The steps to the throne were flanked by Bronn and Ser Preston of the Kingsguard. Courtiers filled the gallery while supplicants clustered near the towering oak-and-bronze doors. Sansa Stark looked especially lovely this morning, though her face was as pale as milk. Lord Gyles stood coughing, while poor cousin Tyrek wore his bridegroom's mantle of miniver and velvet. Since his marriage to little Lady Ermesande three days past, the other squires had taken to calling him "Wet Nurse" and asking him what sort of swaddling clothes his bride wore on their wedding night.</div>

<div class="line_en">The thin wooden door split with a thunderous crack beneath the heel of Shagga's boot. Pieces went flying inward, and Tyrion heard a woman's gasp of fear. Shagga hacked the door apart with three great blows of his axe and kicked his way through the ruins. Timett followed, and then Tyrion, stepping gingerly over the splinters. The fire had burned down a few glowing embers, and shadows lay thick across the bedchamber. When Timett ripped the heavy curtains off the bed, the naked serving girl stared up with wide white eyes. "Please, my lords," she pleaded, "don't hurt me." She cringed away from Shagga, flushed and fearful, trying to cover her charms with her hands and coming up a hand short.</div>
