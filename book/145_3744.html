<div class="line_en">Sichuan pepper, flower pepper, prickly ash, hua jiao… It is the original Chinese pepper, a native spice used long before black pepper stole in over the tortuous land routes of the old Silk Road. It is also the space dust of the spice world. An unexpected first encounter with it can be disconcerting, to put it mildly. I offered some to a stranger, once, at the annual Oxford Food Symposium, without a word of warning: he thought I was trying to poison him, and hasn't spoken to me since. Actually, I should have been more careful, remembering my own first experience of Sichuan pepper, during a visit to Chongqing in 1992. 'The dishes were all flavoured with a particular spice which I found utterly unpalatable,' I wrote in my diary. 'It tasted like a powerful combination of aniseed, lemongrass and chilli and numbed my mouth with an unbearable taste. I ate very little other than soup and rice.'</div>

<div class="line_en">The air in the orchard has a mesmerising, citrussy smell. The pimpled green berries, just beginning to blush pink, cling in ones and twos to the thorny stems of the trees. Despite the drizzle and the grey sky, I'm elated. I pluck a pair of peppercorns and rub them in my hands. The fragrance comes quickly, perfuming the air around. It is overwhelming, so fresh and zesty, so redolent of wood and wildness. I close my eyes. And then I put some pepper between my lips. In its green astringent newness, it puckers my tongue immediately, and then, a few seconds later, the tingling hits. That incomparable tongue-numbing sensation of Sichuan pepper, a fizzing that starts stealthily and rises to a mouth-streaming, breathtaking crescendo that can last for twenty minutes, before it slowly, gradually dies away. It is stronger even than I expected, and I laugh in surprise. For years I have dreamt of tasting Sichuan pepper on the tree, and here I am, in Qingxi itself, my lips singing.</div>

<div class="line_en">I smile to read that now, knowing how the gentler cooking of Chengdu turned me into a Sichuan-pepper addict. And I have developed a better strategy for introducing it to other people. Psychological preparation is essential ('Are you sitting comfortably? Then let me explain…'). Instructions must be followed precisely. 'Put this pepper husk into your mouth, chew it two or three times at the front of your mouth and then spit it out immediately! Do not carry on chewing, wondering why nothing is happening, or it may overwhelm you (the tingling sensation takes a good ten seconds or so to develop). Now sit back and wait!' This more subtle approach tends to win people over, if only because of the wild novelty of the sensation, and I've seen many of my friends succumb to its charms.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在读到这些，我脸上都会泛起微笑，因为更为温柔的成都菜已经让我对花椒上了瘾。而且要把这香料介绍给对它并不熟悉的人，我也制定了更好的策略。核心是心理准备。（“您坐得舒服吗？那我来解释一下……”）一定要让对方准确遵循你的指导。“把这颗花椒子放进嘴里，先放在嘴前端咬个两三次，然后马上吐出来！不要一直嚼一直嚼，想着怎么没什么味道，等有味道了你就受不了了（麻酥酥的刺痛感差不多要十秒左右才会浮现）。现在坐好了，等着！”这种更温柔的办法比较容易赢得人心，再加上那种野性而新奇的感觉，我见证了很多朋友臣服于花椒的魅力。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In all my years of research for my Sichuanese cookery book, I never actually saw a Sichuan pepper tree. For that, you have to go to the high, dry slopes of various places in northern and western Sichuan. But of all the pepper grown in the province, none is better than that of the remote county of Hanyuan in the southwestern mountains, and within Hanyuan County itself, nothing compares to the sumptuously aromatic pepper of Qingxi Township. Even within Qingxi there are finer distinctions for aficionados: if you want to reach the very pinnacle of peppery perfection, you must accept nothing less than pepper harvested from the trees of niu shi po, the Ox Market Slopes, at the village of Jianli just outside Qingxi itself. Once, this pepper was sent in tribute to the imperial court. 'Qingxi Tribute Pepper', they still call it here.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我为川菜食谱做了那么多年的研究，还从没亲眼见过花椒树呢。要看这种树，你得去川西北的几个地方，爬上高高的土坡。但全四川省的花椒，最好的还要数西南山区的偏远小县汉源；而汉源县的花椒，最好的又来自小镇清溪，那里的花椒有着特别奢侈的香味。就连清溪镇内，花椒也有等级之分。要是想得到金字塔尖完美的花椒，你只能买从清溪镇外不远的建黎乡牛市坡的树上采摘的。曾经，这里的花椒是送到皇宫的贡品，到现在当地人还将其称为“清溪贡椒”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I'm not sure why it took me so long to go to Qingxi, when I'd wanted to for many years, but I only made it there, for the first time, in 2001. Most of my Chinese acquaintances would have baulked at the idea of accompanying me on a gruelling journey into the impoverished backwoods of the province, but one old friend, Mu Ma, was game. So, one morning in June, we set off from Chengdu by long-distance bus on the hard eight-hour ride to Hanyuan County.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我也不知道为什么等了这么久才去清溪。想去已经想了很多年了，但一直到二零零一年，我才真正去到那里。说到要陪我去四川贫穷偏僻的小山村，一路上路又难走、条件又差，我在中国的熟人大多面露难色，但老朋友穆玛却欣然答应。于是，六月的一天早上，我们从成都出发，坐上长途大巴，准备经历八小时的漫长旅途，前往汉源县。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I met Mu Ma in the course of my food investigations in Chengdu, and we hit it off immediately. He's an academic who spends his time travelling around remote villages in south-west China, researching and documenting traditional crafts and rituals before they disappear. Since knowing me, he's taken more of an interest in beancurd workshops, kitchen ranges and bakeries. Mu Ma's shaggy black hair always looks untidy, even if it's just been cut. He speaks in Chengdu dialect, and teaches me local nursery rhymes, like the Sichuanese equivalent of 'Jack Sprat and his wife':</div>

<div class="line_en">Sichuan pepper is one of the spices mentioned in the ancient Book of Songs, where its shiny and abundant seeds are a symbol of fertility (a seed and a son sound the same in Chinese: zi). 'Pepper houses' (jiao fang), they used to call the chambers of Han Dynasty imperial concubines, because the spice was mixed into the mud used to plaster their walls, in the hope that the women would produce sons and heirs. Rural people exchanged bunches of Sichuan peppercorns as love tokens; the spice is still imbued with erotic symbolism because of the way its berries hang in pairs, like testicles. Even today, in remote parts of Sichuan Province, peppercorns are thrown over brides and grooms, an aromatic confetti.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="中国古代诗歌总集《诗经》中就曾提到花椒，认为那闪亮而丰富的种子是“多子”的象征。汉朝皇妃们的寝宫称为“椒房”，因为糊墙用的泥土中掺了花椒，寓意皇嗣绵延。平民百姓会用一串串的花椒作为定情信物。到现在，这种香料仍然蕴含着强烈的情色象征意义，因为很多果实都是一双一双挂在枝头的，让人联想起男性睾丸。时至今日，四川的偏远地区还保留着古老的习俗，婚礼的时候要朝新郎新娘扔花椒，就像现代婚礼中抛洒的五彩纸屑与糖果，不过更充满了四溢的芳香。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In another month or two, the children told us, the peppercorns would be dark pink all over, dried by the hot sun, and they would split open to reveal their seeds, black and shiny like the eyes of birds. The young men would then strip the peppercorns from the branches, gather them in bamboo baskets, and lay the split, pimpled berries out in the sun to dry. When they were ready, the local girls would sit on their doorsteps, woven bamboo baskets on their knees, tossing the peppercorns to shake out their tasteless seeds, saving the aromatic husks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="孩子们跟我们说，再过一两个月，花椒就全部变成深粉色了，再加上被炽热的阳光晒后，果实会爆开，露出里面的种子，黑黑亮亮的，像鸟儿的眼睛。村里的年轻人会把花椒子从枝头摘下来，放进筲箕，将这些表面凹凸不平、已经裂开的果子铺在阳光下干透。晒好了，村里的女孩子们就坐在门槛上，膝头放着篾条编好的篮子，把花椒子放进里面翻来覆去地摇，将没味道的种子都摇出来，保留味道浓郁芬芳的外壳。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After my first, striking taste of the fresh pepper, Mu Ma and I left the orchard with our retinue of children, and entered the gates of the Confucian temple opposite, a derelict timber-framed mansion. Once, it must have been splendid; now, it barely whispered of its former glory. A little bridge led over an ornamental pond, but the heads of the statues on its stone balustrades had been knocked off by Red Guards during the Cultural Revolution. The old temple hall had been brutally boarded up and carved into utilitarian rooms, and there were faded revolutionary slogans on the walls. Moss and weeds grew among the flagstones, and the paint on the buildings was peeling. We discovered it was being used as a social centre for the elderly, and on that day they were having a feast, so a dozen round tables had been laid in the courtyard.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="与新鲜花椒初见，“惊鸿一尝”之后，穆玛和我跟着那群还围在旁边的孩子离开花椒园，进入对面的文庙。这座木结构的大庙早已是年久失修。它曾经一定是无比辉煌壮丽的，现在几乎找不到旧日的蛛丝马迹了。造景池上架着一座小桥，但石栏杆上雕像的头已经在“文革”中被红卫兵砸掉了。古老的庙堂中简单粗暴地竖起了好些隔板，变成能用的小房间，墙上还有褪色的革命标语。石板上遍布青苔、荒草丛生，墙漆也四处剥落。我们发现这里是老年人活动中心，那天他们要聚餐，所以院子里摆着十几张圆桌子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The pepper is also a medicinal herb. It was unearthed in the grave of the Han Dynasty noblewoman found at Mawangdui; accompanying prescriptions written on silk advised its use in treating ulcers. It is thought to be a stimulant and diuretic, good also for relieving flatulence and encouraging digestion. Moths and other destructive insects shy away from the pepper's powerful aroma, so it is traditionally used as an insect repellent in wardrobes and granaries. Ingested in large quantities, it is severely toxic -- which is why several ancient texts mention its use as a means of forced suicide.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="花椒还是一味草药。马王堆汉墓的贵族妇女坟中有花椒出土，还有写在丝绸上的药方，指明了其在治疗溃疡中的作用。有理论认为，花椒是一种兴奋剂和利尿剂，还有利于缓解肠胃胀气、促消化。在花椒强烈的味道之下，飞蛾和其他害虫不会接近，所以传统上经常用花椒来做衣柜与谷仓中的驱虫剂。要是大量摄入，会严重中毒，所以好些古代文章中都提到，有人强迫别人大量摄入花椒，造成自杀的假象。">查看中文翻译</div>

At first I was perplexed by their familiarity before it dawned on me that they must be thinking I was Rose Acock, an Englishwoman who had been running poverty-relief projects in rural Hanyuan for years. I had never met Rose, but we had been in email contact once or twice. There clearly hadn't been any other Englishwoman in Hanyuan for a while, let alone another named after a flower. 'I'm not Rose, I'm Fuchsia,' I found myself explaining a hundred times. The villagers were astonished to hear this, but no less friendly.</div>

They loomed closer, and soon I had a policeman at my side, studiously casual. He watched me as I scribbled in my notebook. Then he asked me for my ID. I rummaged in my bag for my passport. He made a big deal of his scrutiny, giving me a sly, disconcerting smile. I began to feel nervous. As far as I knew, there was no reason why I shouldn't be there. But the policeman was intimidating, and long years of experience of such things had taught me that it was best, in such situations, to play humble.</div>

Sichuan is internationally famed for its tourist attractions: the giant Buddha at Leshan, Mount Emei with its 'sea of clouds', and the coloured lakes of Jiuzhaigou. Two hundred years ago, Qingxi was a flourishing transport hub on the cha ma dao, the 'tea-horse way' that connected inner China with Tibet and India; now it was a forgotten backwater.

Barely more than a teenager, lanky and awkward in his uniform, this boy was plainly unsure what to do with the dangerous alien in his charge. I led him out of the temple and back into the village streets, and he stayed within a metre of me at all times, following me into courtyards, up lanes, and into fields.</div>

<div class="line_en">I couldn't understand the senior policeman's paranoia. Perhaps he was being defensive in that faintly nationalistic Chinese way, reluctant to let a foreigner see the 'backwardness' of rural China.

But at Beijing airport I had a sudden crisis of conscience. Britain was engulfed in the foot-and-mouth epidemic, and there was a crackdown on the import of fresh foods and agricultural products.

Eventually we agreed a price with the driver of another loaf-of-bread van, a jovial man with round spectacles that echoed the roundness of his face. As he waited for a last passenger to fill up the van, we chatted for a while. 'To look at you,' he said to me, 'one would imagine that you are not Chinese. Are you a foreigner?' Later, talking to Mu Ma, he referred to the ying guo xiao huo zi, the 'young English lad'. Staring at him in amazement, I told him that I was actually a woman, and no longer particularly young. The other passengers laughed at him. 'Sorry, my eyes aren't that good,' he said. I sighed as I thought of him driving us along a rutted track into the mountains. But it couldn't be helped.

'But now people use machines to till the earth,' said the farmer's daughter, 'so they don't keep oxen. It's too expensive to feed them all year round when they are only used for occasional work.'

The village head, warming his hands over a charcoal brazier, offered us tea, and then asked a woman who worked with him to take us around.

'This area produces about ten tonnes of pepper a year,' said our guide, as we surveyed the prickly trees and the snow-blurred terraces of the valley. 'And it's the finest of all.

At that time, the imperial court demanded an annual quota of pepper in tribute, and its representatives in Qingxi were harsh in their exactions. They squeezed the peasants dry, driving them into desperate poverty. Eventually the peasants could bear it no more, and they petitioned the higher levels of government for mercy.

I recognised among them the smartly dressed people I had seen earlier in the temple. (So I had been right.) The Party Secretary was warmly welcoming, and raised repeated toasts to my health. 'Welcome to Sichuan! Welcome to Hanyuan. Even more welcome to Qingxi!' he cried. One or two other officials made attempts to be friendly, but it was clear that the rest of them harboured some lingering doubts about my presence. They glanced uneasily at my notebook as I scribbled.

There was jia sha rou (slices of fat belly pork with glutinous rice and sweet red-bean paste, turned out of a steaming bowl and sprinkled with sugar); tea-fragrant salted greens stir-fried with minced pork; a whole pork knuckle, dressed in a lavish fish-fragrant sauce and sliding lazily off the bone; stewed brown beans with Sichuan pepper oil; a magnificent chicken stew with tian ma, an expensive medicinal tuber; and a slow, hearty stew of beef with carrot. The ingredients were locally produced and they tasted stupendous. It was the best Chinese meal I'd had in months, better than anything I'd had in the glamorous restaurants of Shanghai, and I couldn't stop eating.

You think they are generous, but I bet as far as local people are concerned, everything they give you, all that meat, all that wine, all that precious pepper, is paid for with money that they have screwed out of the peasants. I suspect they are just using you, trying to win you over. How can the local people see these officials as anything other than blood-suckers, greedy and idle? Look at them, running hotels and karaoke bars, hosting dinner parties at public expense. You've seen how poor people are here. When you said, at the pig slaughter, that you were going for dinner at the Mountain Villa, the family we were with all exchanged meaningful looks. And after you'd gone, they told me that's the place where the officials go, where they spend public money on food and drink. They hate the officials, and now they think you are one of them. As far as they are concerned, you have been eating and drinking at the expense of all the poor peasants of Qingxi.'</div>

What do you expect me to do when the local party secretary orders me into his office? Cause a scene by resisting? Anyway, I'm a writer, I have to see all sides of Chinese society.

<div class="line_en">His words hit me like a thump in the stomach. It was true that corruption was rife all over China. Indeed, in the autumn of 2004, Hanyuan County itself had hit the international headlines. Venal local officials tried to evict tens of thousands of local farmers from their land to make way for a hydroelectric dam, and then to cheat them out of their compensation funds. The outraged peasants rose up against them, staging a sit-in by the dam construction site, just a few miles upriver from Qingxi. The central government, nervous at any sign of unrest, sent in top-ranking officials to reassure the populace, and paramilitary police to crush the riots before they spread. There were days of rioting, with mass attacks on government offices. Farmers were shot and killed: no one knew how many, because of the news blackout imposed on the whole county. Reading about this, I'd remembered about that paranoid policeman I'd met in 2001, and his vigilance had made more sense.</div>

<div class="line_en">He didn't need to mention the riots of 2004. Had any of the officials I'd met been involved in the forced evictions, the compensation scam, and the violence? The Party Secretary had seemed genuinely warm and friendly, and had only recently been assigned to this job, perhaps in an attempt to clear the bad air after the riots. He certainly hadn't been around at the time. And the centre of the troubles had been a few miles away. But less than three years ago, this whole county had been under paramilitary control. After the turmoil, one local man, charged with killing a policeman, was secretly executed before he could appeal. The people of Hanyuan county, if not Qingxi itself, had even more reason to hate their local leaders than most Chinese peasants. A century after the pepper farmers had won their battle over tribute tax, some of them were again struggling to protect their livelihoods from the extortions of their leaders.

But then the pig reared up on its hind legs and tried to attack me, snarling and snapping. Dark, hairy, and vicious, it leapt into the air like a dog.
