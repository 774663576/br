<div class="line_en">WITH no greater events than these in the Longbourn family, and otherwise diversified by little beyond the walks to Meryton, sometimes dirty and sometimes cold, did January and February pass away. March was to take Elizabeth to Hunsford. She had not at first thought very seriously of going thither; but Charlotte, she soon found, was depending on the plan, and she gradually learned to consider it herself with greater pleasure as well as greater certainty. Absence had increased her desire of seeing Charlotte again, and weakened her disgust of Mr. Collins. There was novelty in the scheme; and as, with such a mother and such uncompanionable sisters, home could not be faultless, a little change was not unwelcome for its own sake. The journey would moreover give her a peep at Jane; and, in short, as the time drew near, she would have been very sorry for any delay. Every thing, however, went on smoothly, and was finally settled according to Charlotte's first sketch. She was to accompany Sir William and his second daughter. The improvement of spending a night in London was added in time, and the plan became perfect as plan could be.</div>

<div class="line_en">The farewell between herself and Mr. Wickham was perfectly friendly; on his side even more. His present pursuit could not make him forget that Elizabeth had been the first to excite and to deserve his attention, the first to listen and to pity, the first to be admired; and in his manner of bidding her adieu, wishing her every enjoyment, reminding her of what she was to expect in Lady Catherine de Bourgh, and trusting their opinion of her -- their opinion of every body -- would always coincide, there was a solicitude, an interest which she felt must ever attach her to him with a most sincere regard; and she parted from him convinced that, whether married or single, he must always be her model of the amiable and pleasing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她跟韦翰先生告别时，双方都十分客气，韦翰比她还要客气。他目前虽然在追求别人，却并没有因此就忘了伊丽莎白是第一个引起他注目的人，第一个值得他注目的人，第一个听他倾诉衷情，第一个可怜他，第一个搏得了他爱慕的人；他向她告别，祝她万事如意，又对她说了一遍德·包尔夫人是很好的一个人，他相信他们俩对那位老夫人的评价，对每一个人的评价，一定完全吻合。他说这话的时候，显得很是热诚，很是关切，这种盛情一定会使她对他永远怀着极其深挚的好感。他们分手以后，她更相信不管他结婚也罢，单身也罢，他在她的心目中将会始终是一个极其和蔼可亲而又讨人喜欢的人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her fellow-travellers the next day were not of a kind to make her think him less agreeable. Sir William Lucas and his daughter Maria, a good humoured girl, but as empty-headed as himself, had nothing to say that could be worth hearing, and were listened to with about as much delight as the rattle of the chaise. Elizabeth loved absurdities, but she had known Sir William's too long. He could tell her nothing new of the wonders of his presentation and knighthood; and his civilities were worn out like his information.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天和她同路的那些人，也并没有使韦翰在她心目中相形见绌。威廉爵士简直说不出一句中听的话，他那位女儿玛丽亚虽然脾气很好，脑子却象她父亲一样空洞，也说不出一句中听的话。听他们父女俩说话，就好象听到车辆的辘辘声一样无聊。伊丽莎白本来爱听无稽之谈，不过威廉爵士那一套她实在听得腻了。他谈来谈去总不外乎觐见皇上以及荣膺爵士头衔之类的奇闻，翻不出什么新花样来；他那一套礼貌举止，也象他的出言吐语一样，已经陈腐不堪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The only pain was in leaving her father, who would certainly miss her, and who, when it came to the point, so little liked her going that he told her to write to him, and almost promised to answer her letter.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a journey of only twenty-four miles, and they began it so early as to be in Gracechurch-street by noon. As they drove to Mr. Gardiner's door, Jane was at a drawing-room window watching their arrival; when they entered the passage she was there to welcome them, and Elizabeth, looking earnestly in her face, was pleased to see it healthful and lovely as ever. On the stairs were a troop of little boys and girls, whose eagerness for their cousin's appearance would not allow them to wait in the drawing-room, and whose shyness, as they had not seen her for a twelvemonth, prevented their coming lower. All was joy and kindness. The day passed most pleasantly away; the morning in bustle and shopping, and the evening at one of the theatres.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这段旅程不过二十四英里路，他们启程很早，为的是要在正午赶到天恩寺街。他们走近嘉丁纳先生的大门时，吉英正在会客室的窗口望着他们。他们走近过道时，吉英正等在那儿接他们，伊丽莎白真挚地仔细望了望吉英的脸，只见那张脸蛋儿还是象往常一样地健康美丽，她觉得很高兴。男男女女的孩子们为了急于要见到表奶，在客厅里等不及，又因为一年没见面，不好意思下楼去，便都待在楼梯口。到处是一片欢乐与和善的气氛。这一天真过得极其愉快；上午乱哄哄地忙做一团，又要出去买东西；晚上上戏院去看戏。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Elizabeth then contrived to sit by her aunt. Their first subject was her sister; and she was more grieved than astonished to hear, in reply to her minute enquiries, that though Jane always struggled to support her spirits, there were periods of dejection. It was reasonable, however, to hope that they would not continue long. Mrs. Gardiner gave her the particulars also of Miss Bingley's visit in Gracechurch-street, and repeated conversations occurring at different times between Jane and herself, which proved that the former had, from her heart, given up the acquaintance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伊丽莎白在舅母身旁坐下来。她们俩首先就谈到她姐姐。她仔仔细细问了许多话，舅母回答她说，吉英虽然竭力提着精神，还免不了有意气消沉的时候，她听了并不十分诧异，却很忧郁。她在这种意气消沉的现象还会继续多久。嘉丁纳太太也跟伊丽莎白谈起彬格莱小姐过访天恩寺街的一切情形，又把吉英跟她好几次的谈话重述了一遍给她听，这些话足以说明吉英的确打算再不和彬格莱小姐来往了。">查看中文翻译</div>

Oh! what hours of transport we shall spend! And when we do return, it shall not be like other travellers, without being able to give one accurate idea of any thing. We will know where we have gone -- we will recollect what we have seen.
