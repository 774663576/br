<div class="line_en">I didn't have anything special to do, so I went down to the can and chewed the rag with him while he was shaving. We were the only ones in the can, because everybody was still down at the game. It was hot as hell and the windows were all steamy. There were about ten washbowls, all right against the wall. Stradlater had the middle one. I sat down on the one right next to him and started turning the cold water on and off -- this nervous habit I have. Stradlater kept whistling "Song of India" while he shaved. He had one of those very piercing whistles that are practically never in tune, and he always picked out some song that's hard to whistle even if you're a good whistler, like "Song of India" or "Slaughter on Tenth Avenue." He could really mess a song up.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="你记得我说过阿克莱的个人习惯十分邋遢吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Well, so was Stradlater, but in a different way. Stradlater was more of a secret slob. He always looked all right, Stradlater, but for instance, you should've seen the razor he shaved himself with. It was always rusty as hell and full of lather and hairs and crap. He never cleaned it or anything. He always looked good when he was finished fixing himself up, but he was a secret slob anyway, if you knew him the way I did. The reason he fixed himself up to look good was because he was madly in love with himself. He thought he was the handsomest guy in the Western Hemisphere. He was pretty handsome, too -- I'll admit it. But he was mostly the kind of a handsome guy that if your parents saw his picture in your Year Book, they'd right away say, "Who's this boy?" I mean he was mostly a Year Book kind of handsome guy. I knew a lot of guys at Pencey I thought were a lot handsomer than Stradlater, but they wouldn't look handsome if you saw their pictures in the Year Book. They'd look like they had big noses or their ears stuck out. I've had that experience frequently.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="呃，斯特拉德莱塔也一样，只是方式不同。斯特拉德莱塔是私底下邋遢。他外貌总是挺不错，这个斯特拉德莱塔。可是随便举个例子说吧，你拿起他刮脸用的剃刀看看。那剃刀锈得象块烂铁，沾满了肥皂沫、胡子之类的脏东西。他从来不把剃刀擦干净。他打扮停当以后，外貌例挺漂亮，可你要是象我一样熟悉他的为人，就会知道他私底下原是个邋遢鬼。他之所以把自己打扮得漂漂亮亮，是因为他疯狂地爱着他自己。他自以为是西半球上最最漂亮的男子。他长的倒是蛮漂亮――我承认这一点。可他只是那一类型的漂亮男子，就是说你父母如果在《年鉴》上看到了他的照片，马上会说，“这孩子是谁？”――我的意思是说他只是那种《年鉴》上的漂亮男子。在潘西我见过不少人都要比斯特拉德莱塔漂亮，不过你如果在《年鉴》上见了他们的照片，决不会觉得他们漂亮。他们不是显得鼻子太大，就是两耳招风。我自己常常有这经验。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"What?" I said. Not too enthusiastic. He was always asking you to do him a big favor. You take a very handsome guy, or a guy that thinks he's a real hot-shot, and they're always asking you to do them a big favor. Just because they're crazy about themself, they think you're crazy about them, too, and that you're just dying to do them a favor. It's sort of funny, in a way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“什么事？”我说，并不太热心。他老是要求别人大大帮他一个性。有一种长得十分漂亮的家伙，或者一种自以为了不起的人物，他们老是要求别人大大帮他一个忙。他们因为疯狂地爱着自己，也就以为人人都疯狂她爱着他们，人人都渴望着替他们当差。说起来确实有点儿好笑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Anything. Anything descriptive. A room. Or a house. Or something you once lived in or something -- you know. Just as long as it's descriptive as hell." He gave out a big yawn while he said that. Which is something that gives me a royal pain in the ass. I mean if somebody yawns right while they're asking you to do them a goddam favor. "Just don't do it too good, is all," he said. "That sonuvabitch Hartzell thinks you're a hot-shot in English, and he knows you're my roommate. So I mean don't stick all the commas and stuff in the right place."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“写什么都成。只要是描写性的。一个房间。或者一所房子。或者什么你过去住过助地方――你知道。只要他妈的是描写的就成。”他一边说，一边打了个很大的呵欠。就是这类事让我十分恼火。我是说，如果有人一边口口声声要求你帮他妈的什么忙，一边却那么打着呵欠。“只是别写的太好，”他说。“那个婊子养的哈兹尔以为你的英文好的了不得，他也知道你跟我同住一屋。因此我意思是你别把标点之类的玩艺儿放对位置。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That's something else that gives me a royal pain. I mean if you're good at writing compositions and somebody starts talking about commas. Stradlater was always doing that. He wanted you to think that the only reason he was lousy at writing compositions was because he stuck all the commas in the wrong place. He was a little bit like Ackley, that way. I once sat next to Ackley at this basketball game. We had a terrific guy on the team, Howie Coyle, that could sink them from the middle of the floor, without even touching the backboard or anything. Ackley kept saying, the whole goddam game, that Coyle had a perfect build for basketball. God, how I hate that stuff.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这又是另一类让我十分恼火的事。我是说如果你作文做得好，可是有人口口声声谈着标点。斯特拉德莱塔老干这一类事。他要你觉得，他的作文之所以做不好，仅仅是因为他把标点全放错了位置。在这方面他也有点象阿克莱。有一次我坐在阿克莱旁边看比赛篮球。我们队里有员棒将，叫胡维。考埃尔，能中场投篮，百发百中，连球架上的板都不碰一下。阿克莱在他妈的整个比赛中却老是说考埃尔的身材打篮球合适极了。天哪，我多讨厌这类玩艺儿。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I got bored sitting on that washbowl after a while, so I backed up a few feet and started doing this tap dance, just for the hell of it. I was just amusing myself. I can't really tap-dance or anything, but it was a stone floor in the can, and it was good for tap-dancing. I started imitating one of those guys in the movies. In one of those musicals. I hate the movies like poison, but I get a bang imitating them. Old Stradlater watched me in the mirror while he was shaving. All I need's an audience. I'm an exhibitionist. "I'm the goddam Governor's son," I said. I was knocking myself out. Tap-dancing all over the place. "He doesn't want me to be a tap dancer. He wants me to go to Oxford. But it's in my goddam blood, tap-dancing." Old Stradlater laughed. He didn't have too bad a sense of humor. "It's the opening night of the Ziegfeld Follies." I was getting out of breath. I have hardly any wind at all. "The leading man can't go on. He's drunk as a bastard. So who do they get to take his place? Me, that's who. The little ole goddam Governor's son."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我在盥洗盆上坐了会儿，觉得腻烦了，心里一时高兴，就往后退了几步，开始跳起踢蹬舞来。我只是想让自己开开心。我实际上并不会跳踢蹬舞这类玩艺儿，不过盥洗室里是石头地板，跳踢蹬舞十分合适。我开始学电影里的某个家伙。是那种歌舞片里的。我把电影恨得象毒药似的，可我倒是很高兴学电影里的动作。老斯特拉德莱塔刮脸的时候在镜子里看着我跳舞。我也极需要一个观众。我喜欢当着别人卖弄自己。“我是混帐州长的儿子，”我说。我那样不要命地跳着踢蹬舞，都快把自己累死了。“我父亲不让我跳踢蹬舞。他要我上牛津。可这是他妈的我的命――踢蹬舞。”老斯特拉德莱塔笑了。他这人倒是有几分幽默感。“今天是‘齐格飞歌舞团’开幕的第一夜。”我都喘不过气来了。我的呼吸本来就十分短促。“那位领舞的不能上场。他醉的象只王八啦。那么谁来替他上场呢？我，只有我。混帐老州长的小儿子。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I walked over to the window, but you couldn't see out of it, it was so steamy from all the heat in the can. "I'm not in the mood right now," I said. I wasn't, either. You have to be in the mood for those things. "I thought she went to Shipley. I could've sworn she went to Shipley." I walked around the can for a little while. I didn't have anything else to do.
