<div class="line_en">He had tried to. When the Bulldog spoke to him (or, as he thought, first snarled and then growled at him) he held out his shaking hand and gasped "Good Doggie, then, poor old fellow." But the beasts could not understand him any more than he could understand them. They didn't hear any words: only a vague sizzling noise. Perhaps it was just as well they didn't, for no dog that I ever knew, least of all a Talking Dog of Narnia, likes being called a Good Doggie then; any more than you would like being called My Little Man.</div>

<div class="line_en">You may think the animals were very stupid not to see at once that Uncle Andrew was the same kind of creature as the two children and the Cabby. But you must remember that the animals knew nothing about clothes. They thought that Polly's frock and Digory's Norfolk suit and the Cabby's howlet hat were as much parts of them as their own fur and feathers. They wouldn't have known even that those three were all of the same kind if they hadn't spoken to them and if Strawberry had not seemed to think so. And Uncle Andrew was a great deal taller than the children and a good deal thinner than the Cabby. He was all in black except for his white waistcoat (not very white by now), and the great grey mop of his hair (now very wild indeed) didn't look to them like anything they had seen in the three other humans. So it was only natural that they should be puzzled. Worst of all, he didn't seem to be able to talk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="你可能会认为，这些动物非常愚蠢，没能一眼就看出安德鲁舅舅和那两个孩子以及马车夫是同类。但你必须记住，动物们对衣服一无所知。它们觉得，波莉的外衣、迪格雷的诺福克套装以及马车夫的圆顶帽是他们身体的一部分，就像它们自己的皮毛和羽翼一样。如果它们不与他们交谈，如果“草莓”也不那样想，它们就不会知道这三人是同类。而且安德鲁舅舅比孩子们高得多，又比马车夫瘦得多。除了白背心外（现在也已经不很白了），他全身都是黑的。在动物们眼里，安德鲁舅舅的灰发（现在很凌乱）与那三人身上的任何东西都不相似。它们自然感到迷惑。最糟糕的是，他似乎不会说话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"And yet, you know," said the Elephant (the She Elephant, of course; her husband, as you remember, had been called away by Aslan). "And yet, you know, it might be an animal of some kind. Mightn't the whitish lump at this end be a sort of face? And couldn't those holes be eyes and a mouth? No nose, of course.

She took the limp form of Uncle Andrew gently in her trunk and set him up on end: upside down, unfortunately, so that two half-sovereigns, three halfcrowns, and a sixpence fell out of his pocket. But it was no use. Uncle Andrew merely collapsed again.</div>

<div class="line_en">The two Moles settled that part of the business pretty quickly. There was some dispute as to which way up Uncle Andrew ought to be put into the hole, and he had a very narrow escape from being put in head foremost. Several animals said his legs must be his branches and therefore the grey, fluffy thing (they meant his head) must be his root. But then others said that the forked end of him was the muddier and that it spread out more, as roots ought to do. So finally he was planted right way up. When they had patted down the earth it came up above his knees.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两只鼹鼠迅速完成了任务。对该栽哪一头意见不一，安德鲁舅舅很难避免要被头朝下栽进土里了。有几个动物说他的腿一定是树枝，因此，那团灰色的毛茸茸的东西（指他的头）一定是根。但其他动物说，叉开的那一端沾了更多的泥土，而且伸得长些，更像根部。最后，他直立着被栽了起来，栽好以后，泥土掩到了他的膝盖。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I object to that remark very strongly," said the Bulldog. But the Elephant walked quietly to the river, filled her trunk with water, and came back to attend to Uncle Andrew. The sagacious animal went on doing this till gallons of water had been squirted over him, and water was running out of the skirts of his frock-coat as if he had been for a bath with all his clothes on. In the end it revived him. He awoke from his faint. What a wake it was! But we must leave him to think over his wicked deed (if he was likely to do anything so sensible) and turn to more important things.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我强烈反对。”公狗说。但大象默默地走到河边，用鼻子灌满水，回来洒在安德鲁舅舅身上。这有灵性的动物不断地浇，直到好多好多水浇到他身上，又从他外衣的边缘流了出来，犹如他穿着衣服洗了一次澡。最后，他恢复了理智，从昏迷中醒了过来，彻彻底底地清醒了！但我们必须将他撇开，让他慢慢去想他做过的坏事（如果他还有可能做出如此有理智的事的话），我们去讲些更重要的事情。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Strawberry trotted on with Digory on his back till the noise of the other animals died away, and now the little group of Aslan and his chosen councillors was quite close. Digory knew that he couldn't possibly break in on so solemn a meeting, but there was no need to do so. At a word from Aslan, the He-Elephant, the Ravens, and all the rest of them drew aside. Digory slipped off the horse and found himself face to face with Aslan. And Aslan was bigger and more beautiful and more brightly golden and more terrible than he had thought. He dared not look into the great eyes.</div>

<div class="line_en">Aslan threw up his shaggy head, opened his mouth, and uttered a long, single note; not very loud, but full of power. Polly's heart jumped in her body when she heard it. She felt sure that it was a call, and that anyone who heard that call would want to obey it and (what's more) would be able to obey it, however many worlds and ages lay between. And so, though she was filled with wonder, she was not really astonished or shocked when all of a sudden a young woman, with a kind, honest face stepped out of nowhere and stood beside her. Polly knew at once that it was the Cabby's wife, fetched out of our world not by any tiresome magic rings, but quickly, simply and sweetly as a bird flies to its nest. The young woman had apparently been in the middle of a washing day, for she wore an apron, her sleeves were rolled up to the elbow, and there were soapsuds on her hands. If she had had time to put on her good clothes (her best hat had imitation cherries on it) she would have looked dreadful; as it was, she looked rather nice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿斯兰昂起多毛的头，张口呼出长长的、不很嘹亮但有力的一声。波莉听得心跳加快。她敢肯定，那是一种呼唤，任何人听到这声呼唤，不管隔了多少世界多少年代，都想听从而且都能够听从。虽然她心中充满了好奇，但当一个看上去善良、诚实的年轻女人不知从哪儿走出来站在她旁边时，她并没有被吓一跳或者感到十分震惊。波莉立刻明白，那就是马车夫的妻子，不是被任何折磨人的魔法戒指从我们的世界硬生生地拖过去的，而是如鸟儿回巢一般迅捷、简单、舒适地到了那里。那年轻女人系着围裙，袖子挽到肘部，手上还沾着肥皂泡，显然刚才正在洗衣服。如果有时间换上好衣服（她最好的帽子上镶有樱桃饰），她看上去准会让人讨厌。那身朴实无华的衣服却使她显得相当可爱。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Of course she thought she was dreaming. That was why she didn't rush across to her husband and ask him what on earth had happened to them both. But when she looked at the Lion she didn't feel quite so sure it was a dream, yet for some reason she did not appear to be very frightened. Then she dropped a little half curtsey, as some country girls still knew how to do in those days. After that, she went and put her hand in the Cabby's and stood there looking round her a little shyly.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I never could abide such goings on, sir, and that's the truth. I'd give 'em what for if I caught 'em at it," said the Cabby.
