<div class="line_en">"Know, O Warlike Kings," said Emeth, "and you, O ladies whose beauty illuminates the universe, that I am Emeth the seventh son of Harpha Tarkaan of the city of Tehishbaan, Westward beyond the desert. I came lately into Narnia with nine and twenty others under the command of Rishda Tarkaan Now when I first heard that we should march upon Narnia I rejoiced; for I had heard many things of your Land and desired greatly to meet you in battle. But when I found that we were to go in disguised as merchants (which is a shameful dress for a warrior and the son of a Tarkaan) and to work by lies and trickery, then my joy departed from me. And most of all when I found we must wait upon a Monkey, and when it began to be said that Tash and Aslan were one, then the world became dark in my eyes. For always since I was a boy I have served Tash and my great desire was to know more of him, if it might be, to look upon his face. But the name of Aslan was hateful to me.</div>

<div class="line_en">"And, as you have seen, we were called together outside the straw-roofed hovel, night after night, and the fire was kindled, and the Ape brought forth out of the hovel something upon four legs that I could not well see. And the people and the Beasts bowed down and did honour to it. But I thought, the Tarkaan is deceived by the Ape: for this thing that comes out of the stable is neither Tash nor any other god. But when I watched the Tarkaan's face, and marked every word that he said to the Monkey, then I changed my mind: for I saw that the Tarkaan did not believe in it himself. And then I understood that he did not believe in Tash at all: for if he had, how could he dare to mock him?</div>

<div class="line_en">But last night, as some of you know, the Monkey brought not forth the yellow thing but said that all who desired to look upon Tashlan -- for so they mixed the two words to pretend that they were all one -- must pass one by one into the hovel. And I said to myself, Doubtless this is some other deception. But when the Cat had followed in and had come out again in a madness of terror, then I said to myself, Surely the true Tash, whom they called on without knowledge or belief, has now come among us, and will avenge himself. And though my heart was turned into water inside me because of the greatness and terror of Tash, yet my desire was stronger than my fear, and I put force upon my knees to stay them from trembling, and on my teeth that they should not chatter, and resolved to look upon the face of Tash though he should slay me. So I offered myself to go into the hovel; and the Tarkaan, though unwillingly, let me go.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，昨天夜里，正如你们之中有几位也知道的那样，那猴子没有把那头黄颜色的东西从马厩里牵出来，却说凡是想瞧瞧塔什兰的——他们故意把两个名字混合成一个名字，假装两者是合为一体的——必须挨个儿到马厩里去。于是我对自己说，毫无疑问，这是另一个骗局。然而，当猫儿进了马厩，又在一阵疯狂恐惧中重新窜出来时，我又跟我自己说道，现在，必定是真正的塔什神来到我们中间了，他们呼唤塔什神，却对塔什神无知无识或是毫无信仰，塔什神要为自己报仇雪恨了。虽然由于塔什神的伟大和恐怖，我的内心已经被慑服，但我的欲望比我的恐惧强烈，我使劲儿克制两膝的颤抖，克制牙齿格格作响，下定决心要瞧瞧塔什的脸，尽管塔什会把我杀了。所以我自动要求进茅草棚子去；而‘泰坎’呢，虽然不愿意，也只好让我进去了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Then I looked about me and saw the sky and the wide lands, and smelled the sweetness. And I said, By the Gods, this is a pleasant place: it may be that I am come into the country of Tash. And I began to journey into the strange country and to seek him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“然后我向四周瞧瞧，我看到了天空和辽阔的大地，闻到了一片芳香。于是我说，诸神作证，这是个好地方：说不定我是进入了塔什的国土。于是我开始在这新奇的国土里漫游，寻找塔什神。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"As soon as I had gone in at the door, the first wonder was that I found myself in this great sunlight (as we all are now) though the inside of the hovel had looked dark from outside. But I had no time to marvel at this, for immediately I was forced to fight for my head against one of our own men. As soon as I saw him I understood that the Monkey and the Tarkaan had set him there to slay any who came in if he were not in their secrets: so that this man also was a liar and a mocker and no true servant of Tash. I had the better will to fight him; and having slain the villain, I cast him out behind me through the door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我刚走进门，第一个奇迹就是我发觉自己置身于这伟大的阳光里（就像我们大家现在一样），虽然这茅草棚子从外边儿看来是漆黑一团的，但我没有工夫为此惊奇，因为我立刻被迫为保全自己的脑袋而跟我们的自己人搏斗。我刚看到他就明白了，原来猴子和‘泰坎’把他布置在那儿，是要把任何不参与其机密而闯进棚子来的人杀掉：所以他这个人也是个撒谎者和嘲弄者，并非塔什神的忠实仆人。我下决心要跟他搏斗；我把那混蛋杀了，把他从门口扔了出去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"So I went over much grass and many flowers and among all kinds of wholesome and delectable trees till lo! in a narrow place between two rocks there came to meet me a great Lion. The speed of him was like the ostrich, and his size was an elephant's; his hair was like pure gold and the brightness of his eyes like gold that is liquid in the furnace. He was more terrible than the Flaming Mountain of Lagour, and in beauty he surpassed all that is in the world even as the rose in bloom surpasses the dust of the desert. Then I fell at his feet and thought, Surely this is the hour of death, for the Lion (who is worthy of all honour) will know that I have served Tash all my days and not him. Nevertheless, it is better to see the Lion and die than to be Tisroc of the world and live and not to have seen him. But the Glorious One bent down his golden head and touched my forehead with his tongue and said, Son, thou art welcome. But I said, Alas, Lord, I am no son of thine but the servant of Tash. He answered, Child, all the service thou hast done to Tash, I account as service done to me. Then by reasons of my great desire for wisdom and understanding, I overcame my fear and questioned the Glorious One and said, Lord, is it then true, as the Ape said, that thou and Tash are one? The Lion growled so that the earth shook (but his wrath was not against me) and said, It is false. Not because he and I are one, but because we are opposites, I take to me the services which thou hast done to him. For I and he are of such different kinds that no service which is vile can be done to me, and none which is not vile can be done to him. Therefore if any man swear by Tash and keep his oath for the oath's sake, it is by me that he has truly sworn, though he know it not, and it is I who reward him. And if any man do a cruelty in my name, then, though he says the name Aslan, it is Tash whom he serves and by Tash his deed is accepted. Dost thou understand, Child? I said, Lord, thou knowest how much I understand. But I said also (for the truth constrained me), Yet I have been seeking Tash all my days. Beloved, said the Glorious One, unless thy desire had been for me thou wouldst not have sought so long and so truly. For all find what they truly seek.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以我走过许多草地许多繁花，在各种各样的茁壮宜人的树木之间盘桓，瞧！终于在两块大石头之间的狭路上碰到了一头大得了不得的狮子，他行动迅速如鸵鸟，躯体庞大如大象，毛发如足赤黄金，眼睛明亮如熔炉中的黄金熔液。他比拉戈尔的火焰山更加可怕，可又美丽得超过世界上一切东西，甚至像盛开的玫瑰之超过沙漠中的尘土一般。我倒在他的脚边，心中想道，毫无疑问，我丧命的时刻到了，因为这狮子（值得尊敬的神）会知道的：我以往的日子里一直信奉效劳的是塔什而不是他。然而，看到阿斯兰而死去，也比做世界上的‘蒂斯罗克’，活着却没见过阿斯兰为好。但，这光荣的狮子俯下他金色的脑袋，用舌头舔舔我的前额，说道：儿子，你是受欢迎的。但我说：咳，狮王，我不是你的儿子，而是塔什的仆人。他答道，孩子啊，你对塔什所做的奉献、效劳，我都看做是对我的奉献、效劳。接着，由于我渴望求得智慧和颖悟，我克服了我的恐惧，向光荣的狮王求教，我说，狮王啊，如此说来，无尾猿所说的你和塔什是二位一体，难道是正确的吗？狮子大声咆哮，大地为之震动（但他的愤怒不是冲着我来的），他说道：这是错误的。并不由于他和我是二位一体，而是因为我们是截然相反的，我把你对他所做的奉献和效劳拿过来，因为我和他性质根本不同：凡是卑鄙无耻的效劳，一个也没法儿奉献给我；凡是能奉献给塔什的效劳，没有一个不是卑鄙无耻的。因此，如果有什么人以塔什的名义起誓，为起誓而信守誓言，他其实是对我起誓，尽管他自己不知道，而酬谢他的，也是我。如果有什么人，以我的名义，做了一件残酷的事情，那么，尽管他嘴上讲的是阿斯兰，其实他效劳的是塔什，正是塔什接受了他的奉献。孩子，你明白了吗？我说，狮王啊，你知道我明白了。但我也说（因为真理迫使我说出来），我以往的日子里一直在寻找塔什。光荣的狮王答道：亲爱的，除非你的愿望是要找我，你是不会寻找得那么真心实意、那么长久的。因为所有的人都能找到他们真心寻找的东西。">查看中文翻译</div>

And they stared at him for a whole ten seconds before five or six voices said all at once, "Why, it's old Puzzle!" They had never seen him by daylight with the lion-skin off, and it made an extraordinary difference. He was himself now: a beautiful donkey with such a soft, grey coat and such a gentle, honest face that if you had seen him you would have done just what Jill and Lucy did -- rushed forward and put your arms round his neck and kissed his nose and stroked his ears.</div>

<div class="line_en">When they asked him where he had been he said he had come in at the door along with all the other creatures but he had -- well, to tell the truth, he had been keeping out of their way as much as he could; and out of Aslan's way. For the sight of the real Lion had made him so ashamed of all that nonsense about dressing up in a lion-skin that he did not know how to look anyone in the face. But when he saw that all his friends were going away Westward, and after he had had a mouthful of grass ("And I've never tasted such good grass in my life," said Puzzle), he plucked up his courage and followed. "But what I'll do if I really have to meet Aslan, I'm sure I don't know," he added.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们问它一直在哪儿，它说它跟其他动物一同走进门来的，但它曾经——咳，说句老实话，它曾经尽可能躲开他们，躲开阿斯兰。因为，见到真正的狮王，使它对于披上狮子毛皮的荒唐把戏深感羞耻，它不知道有什么面目去跟大家见面相会。但是，当它看见它所有的朋友都朝西跑掉了，它吃了一两口青草后（“我生平从来没有吃到过这样鲜美的青草。”迷惑说道。）便鼓起勇气，跟着大家进来了。“但，如果我真的不得不遇见阿斯兰，我相信我自己是不知如何是好的。”它补充道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The Eagle is right," said the Lord Digory. "Listen, Peter. When Aslan said you could never go back to Narnia, he meant the Narnia you were thinking of. But that was not the real Narnia. That had a beginning and an end. It was only a shadow or a copy of the real Narnia which has always been here and always will be here: just as our world, England and all, is only a shadow or copy of something in Aslan's real world. You need not mourn over Narnia, Lucy. All of the old Narnia that mattered, all the dear creatures, have been drawn into the real Narnia through the Door. And of course it is different; as different as a real thing is from a shadow or as waking life is from a dream." His voice stirred everyone like a trumpet as he spoke these words: but when he added under his breath "It's all in Plato, all in Plato: bless me, what do they teach them at these schools!" the older ones laughed. It was so exactly like the sort of thing they had heard him say long ago in that other world where his beard was grey instead of golden. He knew why they were laughing and joined in the laugh himself. But very quickly they all became grave again: for, as you know, there is a kind of happiness and wonder that makes you serious. It is too good to waste on jokes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“老鹰的话是正确的，”迪格雷勋爵说道，“听着，彼得。阿斯兰说你永远回不了纳尼亚时，他指的是你脑子里正想着的那个纳尼亚。但那不是真正的纳尼亚。那有一个开端也有一个结局。那只不过是真正的纳尼亚的一个影子或是摹本，过去和将来，莫不总是如此，正如我们自己的世界，英国和世界各国，只不过是在阿斯兰的世界里的某些东西的一个影子或摹本。露茜，你无需为纳尼亚哀悼。老纳尼亚中一切重要的东西，一切可爱的动物，都已经由那个门进入了真正的纳尼亚。当然啦，这是不同的，就像一件真的东西跟它的影子是不同的。或者就像醒着的生活跟一个梦是不同的那样。”当他说这些话时，他的声音像喇叭一样使大家为之激动：但，当他低声补充道：“这意思都写在柏拉图的书里了，都写在柏拉图的书里了：我的天哪，他们在那些学校里教些什么呀！”年纪较大的人都哈哈大笑。这一席话跟他们好久以前在另一个世界里听他讲的那种话完全一模一样，不过在那个世界里他的胡子不是金色的，而是灰白色的。他知道他们为什么哈哈大笑，他自己也就参加这场大笑。但是，他们很快又变得严肃了，因为，正如你所知道的，有一种幸福与神奇之感使你认真对待。这境界实在太好了，使你舍不得浪费在笑话上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It is as hard to explain how this sunlit land was different from the old Narnia as it would be to tell you how the fruits of that country taste. Perhaps you will get some idea of it if you think like this. You may have been in a room in which there was a window that looked out on a lovely bay of the sea or a green valley that wound away among mountains. And in the wall of that room opposite to the window there may have been a lookingglass. And as you turned away from the window you suddenly caught sight of that sea or that valley, all over again, in the looking glass. And the sea in the mirror, or the valley in the mirror, were in one sense just the same as the real ones: yet at the same time they were somehow different -- deeper, more wonderful, more like places in a story: in a story you have never heard but very much want to know. The difference between the old Narnia and the new Narnia was like that. The new one was a deeper country: every rock and flower and blade of grass looked as if it meant more. I can't describe it any better than that: if ever you get there you will know what I mean.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="很难解释这阳光普照的国土跟老的纳尼亚王国有什么不同，就像没法儿跟你说清楚这国土上的果实滋味如何与众不同一样。如果你这样想一想，也许会得到一些启发。你也许曾经在这样一个房间里待过：房间的窗子面临一个美丽可爱的海湾或是蜿蜒于群山之间的苍翠溪谷。房间里对着窗子的墙上也许挂着一面镜子。当你从窗口转过身来时，你突然从镜子里看到了海湾或溪谷，重新都看了一遍。而镜子里的大海，或镜子里的溪谷，在某种意义上，是跟真的大海或溪谷是一模一样的。然而同时不知怎么的又有所不同：真的更深，更神奇，更像一个故事里的地方——一个你从未听到过、却很想知道的故事。旧的纳尼亚和新的纳尼亚之间的区别就像这样。新的纳尼亚是个更深湛的国土，每块石头，每朵花，每片草叶，看上去仿佛都更加意味深长。我没法儿描摹得更具体了，如果你上那儿去，你就会懂得我的意思。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He shook his mane and sprang forward into a great gallop -- a Unicorn's gallop, which, in our world, would have carried him out of sight in a few moments. But now a most strange thing happened. Everyone else began to run, and they found, to their astonishment, that they could keep up with him: not only the Dogs and the humans but even fat little Puzzle and short-legged Poggin the Dwarf. The air flew in their faces as if they were driving fast in a car without a windscreen. The country flew past as if they were seeing it from the windows of an express train. Faster and faster they raced, but no one got hot or tired or out of breath.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="独角兽摇晃鬃毛，向前蹿去，随即四蹄凌空疾马也飞跑——在我们的世界里，一头独角兽这样的驰骋，那就一忽儿便跑得看不见影踪了。却说这时出现一桩非常奇怪的事情。其他的人和兽也都开始奔跑了，使他们自己大吃一惊的是，他们都能赶得上独角兽：不仅狗儿和人，而且连胖胖的小驴子和矮腿小矮人波金也都赶得上哩。风猛吹在他们的脸上，仿佛他们是在一辆没有挡风玻璃的、疾驰如飞的汽车里。乡村在他们的身旁飞快地掠过，就像他们在特别快车的车窗里望见的一样。他们愈跑愈快，但没有一个感到热不可耐、疲倦或喘不过气来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was the Unicorn who summed up what everyone was feeling. He stamped his right fore-hoof on the ground and neighed, and then cried: "I have come home at last! This is my real country! I belong here. This is the land I have been looking for all my life, though I never knew it till now. The reason why we loved the old Narnia is that it sometimes looked a little like this. Bree-hee-hee! Come further up, come further in!"</div>
