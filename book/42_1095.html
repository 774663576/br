<div class="line_en">"You're new here, right?" said X-Ray. "I've been here for almost a year. I've never found anything. You know, my eyesight's not so good. No one knows this, but you know why my name's X-Ray?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Stanley picked up his shovel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利捡起铲子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I guess," Stanley agreed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我想是的。”斯坦利附和道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He slammed his blade into the ground, then dumped out another shovelful of dirt. It was a little surprising, he thought, that X-Ray was the leader of the group, since he obviously wasn't the biggest or the toughest. In fact, except for Zero, X-Ray was the smallest. Armpit was the biggest. Zigzag may have been taller than Armpit, but that was only because of his neck. Yet Armpit, and all the others, seemed to be willing to do whatever X-Ray asked of them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他将铲子狠狠地插进地里，往洞外抛出又一铲土。X光居然是D组的头儿，这真让他觉得有些惊讶。显然，X光不是最高大的，也不是最强壮的。事实上，除了零蛋，X光是最弱小的一个。胳肢窝最高大，锯齿或许比胳肢窝还要高，但只不过是因为他的脖子长。然而，包括胳肢窝在内的所有男孩却似乎对X光有求必应。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The more he thought about it, the more he was glad that he agreed to let X-Ray have anything he might find. If he was going to survive at Camp Green Lake, it was far more important that X-Ray think he was a good guy than it was for him to get one day off. Besides, he didn't expect to find anything anyway. There probably wasn't anything "of interest" out there, and even if there was, he'd never been what you could call lucky.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他越琢磨越觉得开心，因为自己答应了X光把发现的东西给他。要想在翠湖营活下去，至关重要的是让X光认为他是个好兄弟，而不是休息上一天。另外，他本来也没指望能发现什么。或许外面根本就没有什么能让他们感兴趣的东西，就算有，他也永远不会沾上所谓的好运气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As Stanley dug up another shovelful of dirt, it occurred to him that Armpit wasn't the biggest. He, the Caveman, was bigger.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利又挖起一铲土，这时他忽然想到胳肢窝也不是最高大的。他——洞穴人才是最高大的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Caveman's our friend," says Armpit, grabbing him by the shirt collar.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“洞穴人是我们的朋友。”胳肢窝说着，一把揪住德里克·邓恩的衣领。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Just what do you think you're doing?" asks Squid, as he slams his hands into Derrick Dunne's smug face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你知道自己在干什么吗？”乌贼问着，然后在德里克·邓恩那张自以为是的脸上扇了一巴掌。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As he dug his hole, Stanley thought about what it would be like if Derrick Dunne had to fight Armpit or Squid. Derrick wouldn't stand a chance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利一边挖着洞，一边想象着德里克·邓恩被迫同胳肢窝或者乌贼打架时的景象。德里克根本就没机会赢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was really quite remarkable to him. At school, bullies like Derrick Dunne used to pick on him. Yet Derrick Dunne would be scared senseless by any of the boys here.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这件事对他而言意义非凡。在学校里，像德里克·邓恩这样的小霸王总是找他的茬。然而这里的任何一个男孩都能把德里克·邓恩吓得不省人事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stanley played the scene over and over again in his mind, each time watching another boy from Group D beat up Derrick Dunne. It helped him dig his hole and ease his own suffering. Whatever pain he felt was being felt ten times worse by Derrick.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利在脑子里一遍又一遍地回味这幅场景，每一遍都想象着又一个D组的男孩将德里克·邓恩狠狠地揍了一顿。这样想着，挖洞不累了，痛苦也减轻了。因为德里克给他带来的痛苦远远超过他挖洞所受的痛苦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was glad they called him Caveman. It meant they accepted him as a member of the group. He would have been glad even if they'd called him Barf Bag.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他很乐意大伙儿管他叫洞穴人。这意味着他被这个小团队接纳了。即便他们管他叫呕吐袋，他也会开心的。">查看中文翻译</div>
