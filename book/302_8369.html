<div class="line_en">"It is but a cottage," she continued, "but I hope to see many of my friends in it. A room or two can easily be added; and if my friends find no difficulty in travelling so far to see me, I am sure I will find none in accommodating them."</div>

<div class="line_en">No sooner was her answer dispatched, than Mrs. Dashwood indulged herself in the pleasure of announcing to her son-in-law and his wife that she was provided with a house, and should incommode them no longer than till every thing were ready for her inhabiting it. They heard her with surprise. Mrs. John Dashwood said nothing; but her husband civilly hoped that she would not be settled far from Norland. She had great satisfaction in replying that she was going into Devonshire. -- Edward turned hastily towards her, on hearing this, and, in a voice of surprise and concern, which required no explanation to her, repeated, "Devonshire! Are you, indeed, going there? So far from hence! And to what part of it?" She explained the situation. It was within four miles northward of Exeter.</div>

<div class="line_en">She concluded with a very kind invitation to Mr. and Mrs. John Dashwood to visit her at Barton; and to Edward she gave one with still greater affection. Though her late conversation with her daughter-in-law had made her resolve on remaining at Norland no longer than was unavoidable, it had not produced the smallest effect on her in that point to which it principally tended. To separate Edward and Elinor was as far from being her object as ever; and she wished to show Mrs. John Dashwood, by this pointed invitation to her brother, how totally she disregarded her disapprobation of the match.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，她非常客气地邀请约翰。达什伍德夫妇去巴顿作客，还一片深情地向爱德华提出邀请。虽然她最近与儿媳的一次谈话促使她打定主意：除非万不得已，否则决不在诺兰庄园多呆一天，但是那次谈话中儿媳的主要意向却对她丝毫没有影响。同以往一样，她这次搬家的目的决不是为了要把爱德华和埃丽诺分开，她想通过针锋相对地邀请爱德华，向约翰。达什伍德夫人表明：“你尽管反对这门亲事好了，我压根儿不买你的帐！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mr. John Dashwood told his mother again and again how exceedingly sorry he was that she had taken a house at such a distance from Norland as to prevent his being of any service to her in removing her furniture. He really felt conscientiously vexed on the occasion; for the very exertion to which he had limited the performance of his promise to his father was by this arrangement rendered impracticable. -- The furniture was all sent around by water. It chiefly consisted of household linen, plate, china, and books, with a handsome pianoforte of Marianne's. Mrs. John Dashwood saw the packages depart with a sigh: she could not help feeling it hard that as Mrs. Dashwood's income would be so trifling in comparison with their own, she should have any handsome article of furniture.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="约翰。达什伍德先生三番五次地对继母说：她在距离诺兰庄园这么远的地方找了座房子，叫他不能为她搬运家具效力，真是不胜遗憾。此时，他良心上的确感到不安，他已经把履行对父亲的诺言局限在帮帮忙这一点上家，“真正的”社会主义的主要代表之一。19世纪40年代初，想不到这样一来，连这点忙也帮不上了。家具全部由水路运走。主要的东西有家用亚麻台布、金银器皿、瓷器、书籍，以及玛丽安的漂亮钢琴。约翰。达什伍德夫人眼看着东西一包包地运走了，不觉叹了口气。达什伍德太太的收入与他们的相比，是微乎其微的，可她竟然能有这么漂亮的家具，怎么能叫她不觉得难受呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The man and one of the maids were sent off immediately into Devonshire, to prepare the house for their mistress's arrival; for as Lady Middleton was entirely unknown to Mrs. Dashwood, she preferred going directly to the cottage to being a visitor at Barton Park; and she relied so undoubtingly on Sir John's description of the house, as to feel no curiosity to examine it herself till she entered it as her own. Her eagerness to be gone from Norland was preserved from diminution by the evident satisfaction of her daughter-in-law in the prospect of her removal; a satisfaction which was but feebly attempted to be concealed under a cold invitation to her to defer her departure. Now was the time when her son-in-law's promise to his father might with particular propriety be fulfilled. Since he had neglected to do it on first coming to the estate, their quitting his house might be looked on as the most suitable period for its accomplishment. But Mrs. Dashwood began shortly to give over every hope of the kind, and to be convinced, from the general drift of his discourse, that his assistance extended no farther than their maintenance for six months at Norland. He so frequently talked of the increasing expenses of housekeeping, and of the perpetual demands upon his purse, which a man of any consequence in the world was beyond calculation exposed to, that he seemed rather to stand in need of more money himself than to have any design of giving money away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那位男仆和一位女仆当即被差往德文郡，收拾房子迎接女主人。因为达什伍德太太与米德尔顿夫人素昧平生，她宁肯立即住进乡舍，而不愿到巴顿庄园作客。约翰爵士将房子描述过了，对此她深信不疑，无心再去亲自查看，等搬进去再说吧。她要离开诺兰庄园的心情越来越迫切。明摆着，那位儿媳眼见她要搬家了，不禁得意扬扬，那股得意劲儿，即使在冷冰冰地请她推迟几天再走的时候，也不加掩饰。现在该是约翰，达什伍德妥善履行对父亲的诺言的时候啦。既然他初来诺兰庄园时没有尽到责任，现在她们行将离开他的家，也许是他履行诺言的最好时机。但是，达什伍德太太很快就死了这个心，她从他的话音里听得出来，他所谓的帮助只不过是让她们在诺兰庄园寄住了六个月。他成天喋喋不休，什么家庭开支越来越大呀，什么要花钱的地方没完没了呀，什么不管多么显要的人物也面临着无可估量的花销问题呀，听起来，他自己似乎需要更多的钱财收入，而决不想往外送钱。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mrs. Dashwood took the house for a twelvemonth; it was ready furnished, and she might have immediate possession. No difficulty arose on either side in the agreement; and she waited only for the disposal of her effects at Norland, and to determine her future household, before she set off for the west; and this, as she was exceedingly rapid in the performance of everything that interested her, was soon done. -- The horses which were left her by her husband had been sold soon after his death, and an opportunity now offering of disposing of her carriage, she agreed to sell that likewise at the earnest advice of her eldest daughter. For the comfort of her children, had she consulted only her own wishes, she would have kept it; but the discretion of Elinor prevailed. HER wisdom too limited the number of their servants to three; two maids and a man, with whom they were speedily provided from amongst those who had formed their establishment at Norland.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这座房子，达什伍德太太租用一年，里面陈设齐全，她马上就可以住进去。双方在协议中没有遇到任何困难。达什伍德太太只等着处理掉她诺兰庄园的财物，确定好将来家里用几个仆人，然后再启程西迁。因为她对自己关心的事处理起来极其迅速，所以很快就办妥了。她丈夫留下的马匹，在他死后不久就卖掉了。现在又出现一个处理马车的机会，经大女儿恳切相劝，她也同意卖掉。若是依照她自己的愿望，为了使孩子们过得舒适，她还是要留下这辆马车，怎奈埃丽诺考虑周到，只好依了她。也是依照埃丽诺的明智想法，她们还把仆人的数量限制到三个——两个女仆，一个男仆，都是从她们在诺兰庄园已有的仆人中很快挑选出来的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Many were the tears shed by them in their last adieus to a place so much beloved. "Dear, dear Norland!" said Marianne, as she wandered alone before the house, on the last evening of their being there; "when shall I cease to regret you! -- when learn to feel a home elsewhere! -- Oh! happy house, could you know what I suffer in now viewing you from this spot, from whence perhaps I may view you no more! -- And you, ye well-known trees! -- but you will continue the same. -- No leaf will decay because we are removed, nor any branch become motionless although we can observe you no longer! -- No; you will continue the same; unconscious of the pleasure or the regret you occasion, and insensible of any change in those who walk under your shade! -- But who will remain to enjoy you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后向如此可爱的地方告别，母女们可没少流眼泪。“亲爱的诺兰庄园：”离别前的头天夜里，玛丽安在房前独自徘徊，边走边说。“我什么时候能不留恋你呢？什么时候能安心于异土他乡呢？哦，幸福的家园！你知道我现在站在这几打量你有多么痛苦，也许我再也不能站在这儿打量你啦！还有你们，多么熟悉的树木：你们将依然如故。你们的叶子不会因为我们搬走了而腐烂，你们的枝条不会因为我们不能再观看了而停止摇动！那是不会的，你们将依然加故，全然不知你们给人们带来的是喜是哀，全然不知在你们阴影下走动的人们发生了什么变化！可是，谁将留在这儿享受你们给予的乐趣呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
