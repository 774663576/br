<div class="line_en">There was no train until the next day. Heston quieted him during the evening with a stiff drink of gin manufactured from alcohol taken from the medical laboratory. Eugene was silent and babbled incoherently by starts: he asked the medical student a hundred questions about the progress and action of the disease.</div>

<div class="line_en">Eugene went to Exeter the next morning to catch the train. All through a dreary gray afternoon it pounded across the sodden State. Then, there was a change and a terrible wait of several hours at a junction. Finally, as dark came, he was being borne again toward the hills.</div>

<div class="line_en">Within his berth he lay with hot sleepless eyes, staring out at the black mass of the earth, the bulk of the hills. Finally, in the hours after midnight, he dropped into a nervous doze. He was wakened by the clatter of the trucks as they began to enter the Altamont yards. Dazed, half-dressed, he was roused by the grinding halt, and a moment later was looking out through the curtains into the grave faces of Luke and Hugh Barton.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他躺在卧铺上，圆睁着双眼，睡不着觉，只是呆呆地望着车窗外面漆黑的大地和层层的群山。最后，熬过午夜以后，他终于支撑不住了，于是心绪不宁地打了一个盹。当列车驶进阿尔特蒙车站时，车厢里发出嘎嘎的刹车声，他猛地惊醒了。在睡眼惺忪之中，他连衣服都没有来得及穿好，便透过卧铺的窗帘缝向外张望着。他看见卢克和休·巴顿两人严肃的面孔。">查看中文翻译</div>

His strange and sudden return to it heightened his feeling of unreality. In one of the cars lined at the station curbing, the driver lay huddled below his blanket. In the Greek's lunchroom a man sat sprawled faced downward on the counter. The lights were dull and weary: a few burned with slow lust in the cheap station-hotels.</div>

<div class="line_en">The powerful car roared up into the chill dead Square. The feeling of unreality grew upon the boy. He sought for his life, for the bright lost years, in this mean cramped huddle of brick and stone. Ben and I, here by the City Hall, the Bank, the grocery-store (he thought). Why here?

The light in the sickroom burned grayly, bringing to him its grim vision of struggle and naked terror.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ben's long thin body lay three-quarters covered by the bedding; its gaunt outline was bitterly twisted below the covers, in an attitude of struggle and torture. It seemed not to belong to him, it was somehow distorted and detached as if it belonged to a beheaded criminal. And the sallow yellow of his face had turned gray; out of this granite tint of death, lit by two red flags of fever, the stiff black furze of a three-day beard was growing. The beard was somehow horrible; it recalled the corrupt vitality of hair, which can grow from a rotting corpse. And Ben's thin lips were lifted, in a constant grimace of torture and strangulation, about his white somehow dead-looking teeth, as inch by inch he gasped a thread of air into his lungs.</div>

<div class="line_en">In this way, the terrible hours of the morning lengthened out, while they spent themselves trying to escape from the tragic net of frustration and loss in which they were caught. Their spirits soared to brief moments of insane joy and exultancy, and plunged into black pits of despair and hysteria. Eliza alone seemed consistently hopeful. Trembling with exacerbated nerves, the sailor and Eugene paced the lower hall, smoking incessant cigarettes, bristling as they approached each other, ironically polite when their bodies touched. Gant dozed in the parlor or in his own room, waking and sleeping by starts, moaning petulantly, detached, vaguely aware only of the meaning of events, and resentful because of the sudden indifference to him. Helen went in and out of the sick-room constantly, dominating the dying boy by the power of her vitality, infusing him with moments of hope and confidence. But when she came out, her hearty cheerfulness was supplanted by the strained blur of hysteria; she wept, laughed, brooded, loved, and hated by turns.</div>

This bright thing, the core of him, his Stranger, kept twisting its head about, unable to look at horror, until at length it gazed steadfastly, as if under a dreadful hypnosis, into the eyes of death and darkness. And his soul plunged downward, drowning in that deep pit: he felt that he could never again escape from this smothering flood of pain and ugliness, from the eclipsing horror and pity of it all. And as he walked, he twisted his own neck about, and beat the air with his arm like a wing, as if he had received a blow in his kidneys. He felt that he might be clean and free if he could only escape into a single burning passion -- hard, and hot, and glittering -- of love, hatred, terror, or disgust. But he was caught, he was strangling, in the web of futility -- there was no moment of hate that was not touched by a dozen shafts of pity: impotently, he wanted to seize them, cuff them, shake them, as one might a trying brat, and at the same time to caress them, love them, comfort them.</div>

The old fantasy of his childhood came back to him: he remembered his hatred of the semi-private bathroom, his messy discomfort while he sat at stool and stared at the tub filled with dirty wash, sloppily puffed and ballooned by cold gray soapy water.

<div class="line_en">Then, over the ugly clamor of their dissension, over the rasp and snarl of their nerves, they heard the low mutter of Ben's expiring breath. The light had been reshaded: he lay, like his own shadow, in all his fierce gray lonely beauty. And as they looked and saw his bright eyes already blurred with death, and saw the feeble beating flutter of his poor thin breast, the strange wonder, the dark rich miracle of his life surged over them its enormous loveliness. They grew quiet and calm, they plunged below all the splintered wreckage of their lives, they drew together in a superb communion of love and valiance, beyond horror and confusion, beyond death.</div>

<div class="line_en">The only sound in the room now was the low rattling mutter of Ben's breath. He no longer gasped; he no longer gave signs of consciousness or struggle. His eyes were almost closed; their gray flicker was dulled, coated with the sheen of insensibility and death. He lay quietly upon his back, very straight, without sign of pain, and with a curious upturned thrust of his sharp thin face. His mouth was firmly shut. Already, save for the feeble mutter of his breath, he seemed to be dead -- he seemed detached, no part of the ugly mechanism of that sound which came to remind them of the terrible chemistry of flesh, to mock at illusion, at all belief in the strange passage and continuance of life.</div>

Then, unevenly, without rhythm, there was a faint mutter of breath. He knew it was the end. He rose quickly and ran to the door. Across the hall, in a cold bedroom, on two wide beds, Gant, Luke, and Helen lay exhausted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不知道什么时候他突然醒了过来，这才意识到自己睡着了，于是心里更加恐惧。他担心病人仅存的一丝气息完全停止了，担心他的祈祷失去了作用。这时候床上的躯体几乎已经僵硬了，没有了声息。就在这时，从床边传来一阵杂乱、不均匀的声音。他心里明白，这一定是本恩生命的最后关头了。他赶紧起身奔到房门口。在走廊对面的一间冰冷的卧室里，甘特、卢克和海伦正精疲力竭地躺在两张大床上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The rattling in the wasted body, which seemed for hours to have given over to death all of life that is worth saving, had now ceased. The body appeared to grow rigid before them. Slowly, after a moment, Eliza withdrew her hands. But suddenly, marvellously, as if his resurrection and rebirth had come upon him, Ben drew upon the air in a long and powerful respiration; his gray eyes opened. Filled with a terrible vision of all death to the dark spirit who had brooded upon each footstep of his pillows without support -- a flame, a light, a glory -- joined at length in death to the dark spirit who had brooded upon each footstep of his lonely adventure on earth; and, casting the fierce sword of his glance with utter and final comprehension upon the room haunted with its gray pageantry of cheap loves and dull consciences and on all those uncertain mummers of waste and confusion fading now from the bright window of his eyes, he passed instantly, scornful and unafraid, as he had lived, into the shades of death.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="许多个小时以来，从那具消耗殆尽的躯体里发出断断续续的微弱声息，似乎是生死之间最值得珍惜的一点东西，现在也终止了。本恩的躯体在他们眼前慢慢地僵硬起来。过了一会儿，伊丽莎才慢慢地把手收回来。但不可思议的是，本恩忽然间好像再次复活了，他深深地吸了一口气，死灰般的眼睛再次睁开了。刹那之间，他的两眼充满了他整整一生的可怕幻景，他的灵魂似乎已经脱了壳，毫无支撑地从枕头上坐了起来——就像一团闪动的火焰、一道亮光、一份荣耀——在死亡的终点，和曾经陪伴他度过孤独一生的神秘精灵会面了；带着最后的一丝彻悟，他那利剑一般的目光扫向这间缺少恩爱、薄情寡义、阴郁且壮丽的屋子，扫向所有那些假慈假悲、疲惫不堪、迷茫的哑剧演员。在这一刻，在场的人都在他明亮的目光下渐渐地消逝了。他面带着藐视和无畏的表情，迅速地消失了，就跟他活的时候一样，走进了死亡的阴影里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They came quickly into the room. Eliza sat unmoving, oblivious of them. As they entered the room, they heard, like a faint expiring sigh, the final movement of breath.</div>

<div class="line_en">We can believe in the nothingness of life, we can believe in the nothingness of death and of life after death -- but who can believe in the nothingness of Ben? Like Apollo, who did his penance to the high god in the sad house of King Admetus, he came, a god with broken feet, into the gray hovel of this world. And he lived here a stranger, trying to recapture the music of the lost world, trying to recall the great forgotten language, the lost faces, the stone, the leaf, the door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们尽可能相信生命是虚无的，也可以相信死亡的虚无以及死后生命的虚无——但是谁能够相信本恩也是虚无呢？就像天神阿波罗在阿德墨托斯天王的冷宫里寻求忏悔一样，他是一位跛脚的神，来到这个阴暗、鄙陋的人世间。他在这里度过了陌生的一生，费尽周折想要重新获得迷失世界的音乐，想要唤醒那些伟大的、早已经被遗忘的语言，还有那些失落的脸孔、石头、树叶和大门。">查看中文翻译</div>
