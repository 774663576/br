<div class="line_en">Chris had pictures of his Air Force buddies up and the shelves were a boyish mess-crumpled T-shirts, loose papers, even a glow-in-the-dark yo-yo with a broken string. Brad Vickers had a stack of self-help books and Joseph, a Three Stooges calendar. Only Wesker's had been devoid of personal effects. Somehow, it didn't surprise her. The captain struck her as too tightly wound to place much value on sentiment.</div>

<div class="line_en">She'd gone through all of the Alpha lockers, grabbing utility belts, fingerless gloves, Kevlar vests and shoulder packs, noting that the lockers reflected their user's personalities: Barry's had been covered with snapshots of his family and a pin-up from a gun magazine, a rare.45 Luger, shining against red velvet.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jill turned toward the door of the dim and silent S. T. A. R. S. locker room, her arms full with two bulging duffel bags. She set them down and quickly pulled her hair back, tucking it into a well-worn black beret. It was really too hot, but it was her lucky hat. She glanced at her watch before hefting the bags, pleased to note that it had only taken her three minutes to load up.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔身体稍微向前倾，微微抬起膝盖以保持平衡，然后伸出手去摸索门闩。就在她抓住门闩的那一瞬间，有人在她的背后重重地咳嗽了一声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her own locker held a number of used paperback true crime novels, a toothbrush, floss, breath mints, and three hats. On the door was a small mirror and an old, frayed photo of her and her father, taken when she was a child and they'd gone to the beach one summer. As she'd quickly thrown the Alpha gear together, she decided that she'd redecorate when she had free time; anyone looking through her locker would think she was some kind of dental freak.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在吉尔自己的保管箱里放着几册犯罪小说、牙刷、牙线、预防口臭的喷雾、还有这顶黑色贝雷帽。箱门上还有一面小镜子，上面贴着发黄的相片，那是在她孩提时代与父亲两个人去海边时拍摄的。只要吉尔一有空就会让自己的保管箱焕然一新。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Startled, Jill dropped the bags and spun, looking for the cougher as her mind reflexively assessed the situation. The door had been locked. The small room held three banks of lockers and had been quiet and dark when she'd come in. There was another door in the back of the room, but no one had come through it since she'd entered-</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔被吓了一跳，连忙将背包放下，转过身寻找发出咳嗽的人。门没有打开，狭窄的房间里并排放着三列保管箱，自己进来的时候这里很静而且很暗。虽然屋子的里面还有一道门，但是可以确定自己来到这里之后，绝对没有人跟进来——">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Miss Valentine, isn't it?" A shadow separated itself from the back of the room and stepped forward, a tall man with a low, musical voice. Early forties, a thin frame, dark hair and deep set eyes. He was actually wearing a trench coat, and an expensive one at that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你是瓦伦蒂安小姐吧？”一个人影从屋子深处站了起来，并向前迈出一步。那是一个个子很高的男人，他的声音低沉而富有节奏感。年纪大概四十出头，身材较瘦，头发黝黑，目光锐利。他的身上穿着厚厚的大衣，一看就知道价值不菲。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They'd gotten the weapons loaded and secured and Wesker was getting impatient. Although his eyes were hidden by dark aviator sunglasses, Chris could see it in the captain's stance and in the way he kept his head cocked toward the building. The helicopter was prepped and ready, the blades whipping warm, humid air through the tight compartment. With the door open, the sound of the engine drowned out any attempt at conversation. There was nothing to do but wait.</div>

<div class="line_en">"ETA… three minutes," Brad called back, and Chris looked around the cabin, noting the silent, grim expressions of his teammates. Joseph had tied a bandana over his head and was intently relacing his boots. Barry was gently rubbing a soft cloth over his beloved Colt Python, staring out the hatch window. He turned his head to look at Jill and was surprised to find her staring back at him thoughtfully. She was sitting on the same bench as him and she smiled briefly, almost nervously as he caught her gaze. Abruptly she unhooked her belt and moved to sit next to him. He caught a faint scent of her skin, a clean, soapy smell.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“距离着陆地点还有…三分钟。”布拉德说道。趁此机会，克里斯环顾机舱内，他发现队友们全部沉默不语地在思考些什么。约瑟夫已经将花头巾包在了头上，此时正在专心地系鞋带。巴瑞正在一边注视着机舱外的景色，一边用柔软的布擦拭着他的爱枪柯尔特PYTHON。克里斯为了看吉尔一眼而扭过头来，而对方也正在凝视着他。她与克里斯坐在同一侧的椅子上，虽然脸上带着浅浅的微笑，可是从眼神中就能看出对方也有些神经过敏。吉尔突然解开安全带，朝着克里斯的身边移过去。而后者则闻到了从吉尔身上飘过来的香皂的清香味。">查看中文翻译</div>

The ragged outskirts of Raccoon Forest slipped by below, the orange markers of the police blockade standing out against the thick muted green of the trees. Twilight was finally setting in, the forest growing heavy with shadow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布拉德调整了一下回旋翼的螺距，直升机的高度稍微降低了一些。由于这轻微的颠簸，克里斯才回想起那些不愉快的记忆。浣熊市森林地带那不整齐的边界从众人的眼皮底下滑过，还能够看到警察布置的橙黄色禁止入内的警示标识，与四周保守的绿色形成了鲜明的对比。黄昏终于要退到舞台的后面，森林逐渐被夜色所覆盖。">查看中文翻译</div>

He decided that after they picked up Bravo, he'd talk to her again, try to convince her that going to Wesker would be their best bet. With both of them pushing, the captain would have to listen. He stared out at the seemingly endless sea of trees as the helicopter skimmed lower, forcing his full attention to the search. The Spencer estate had to be close, though he couldn't see it in the fading light. Thoughts of Billy and Umbrella and now Jill's strange warning circled through his exhaustion, trying to break his focus, but he refused to give in. He was still worried about the Bravos -- though as the trees swept by, he was becoming more and more convinced that they weren't in any real trouble. It was probably nothing worse than a crossed wire, Forest had just shut it down to make repairs --</div>

<div class="line_en">Barry turned to the cabinet next to the outer hatch and unhooked the latch, exposing six Beretta 9mm handguns on a metal rack, cleaned and sighted only yesterday. Each weapon held fifteen rounds, semi-jacketed hollow points. It was a good gun, though Barry preferred his Python, a lot bigger punch with.357 rounds…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="巴瑞转身冲向舱门旁边的一个柜子，打开锁，放在里面的六支贝雷塔手枪暴露在空气中。每一只都是昨天巴瑞调教好的，这种枪可以装填十五发平头空心弹。虽然是好枪，但巴瑞还是更喜欢自己的PYTHON。因为比起贝雷塔，三五七马格南子弹的效果更加强力。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Wesker joined them again and the five of them stood at the hatch, waiting for Brad to bring them in. As they neared the plume of smoke, the helicopter's whirling blades pushed it down and out, creating a black fog that blended into the heavy shadows of the trees.

<div class="line_en">"I hope we don't need these," Joseph said, slapping in a clip, and Barry nodded agreement. Just because he paid his dues to the NRA didn't mean he was some trigger-happy dumbass, looking to kill; he just liked guns.</div>
