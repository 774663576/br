<div class="line_en">Jill felt something tickling her ear. It was Jewel the Unicorn, whispering to her with the wide whisper of a horse's mouth. As soon as she heard what he was saying she nodded and tip-toed back to where Puzzle was standing. Quickly and quietly she cut the last cords that bound the lion-skin to him. It wouldn't do for him to be caught with that on, after what the Ape had said! She would like to have hidden the skin somewhere very far away, but it was too heavy. The best she could do was to kick it in among the thickest bushes. Then she made signs to Puzzle to follow her and they both joined the others.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tirian could not see the faces on the other side of the fire very well but he guessed this was Griffle the Chief Dwarf. And he was quite certain of it when, a second later, all the Dwarfs' voices joined in, singing: "Don't know what to do! Don't know what to do! Don't know what to do-o-o!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="蒂莲对篝火那一边的脸看不大清楚，但他猜测说这话的是小矮人头领格里夫尔。一秒钟后，他对自己的猜测便有了把握，因为所有小矮人的声音都在随声附和了：“不知道怎么办！不知道怎么办！不知道怎么办了！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, no," shouted most of the crowd. But the Dwarfs said, "That's right, Darkie, you've got it. Come on, Monkey, show us what's in the stable, seeing is believing."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，不。”大部分野兽喊道。但小矮人们说：“说对了，黑皮，你击中要害了。猴子，来吧，让我们看看马厩里有什么玩意儿，眼见是实，才能叫人相信。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Silence!" thundered Rishda Tarkaan. "Silence, children of mud! Listen to me, you other Narnians, lest I give command to my warriors to fall upon you with the edge of the sword.

<div class="line_cn" title="“别嚷嚷！”利什达泰坎大发雷霆道，“别嚷嚷，泥土的子孙们！你们其他的纳尼亚国民们，注意听我讲的话，不然我就叫战士们用刀锋砍你们。诡谲王爷已经把邪恶驴子的事讲给你们听了。难道你们认为，由于驴子的缘故，马厩里就没有真正的塔什兰了吗？你们可认为这样吗？小心呀，小心呀。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You thought!" repeated the Ape. "As if anyone could call what goes on in your head thinking. Listen, you others. Anyone can see Tashlan. But he's not coming out. You have to go in and see him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你想！”无尾猿故意重复对方的词儿，“倒像是谁都可以把你头脑里正在进行的活动称之为'想'哩。听着，你们其他的人。任何人都能去见塔什兰。但塔什兰自己可不出来。你们得进去见他。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh, thank you, thank you, thank you," said dozens of voices. "That's what we wanted! We can go in and see him face to face. And now he'll be kind and it will all be as it used to be." And the Birds chattered, and the Dogs barked excitedly. Then suddenly, there was a great stirring and a noise of creatures rising to their feet, and in a second the whole lot of them would have been rushing forward and trying to crowd into the stable door all together. But the Ape shouted: "Get back! Quiet! Not so fast."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，谢谢你，谢谢你，谢谢你。”十几个声音说道，“我们能进去，面对面地见到他。那就是我们所要求的！现在他会是仁慈的，并且将像往常一样，处处仁慈。”鸟儿啁啾，狗儿兴奋地吠叫。然后，突然之间，出现了一阵大骚动、一阵喧哗，野兽们都站起来了，转瞬之间整群野兽都往前冲去，大家都竭力要一齐挤进马厩中去。但无尾猿大声喊道：“回去！安静！且慢！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Anyone can go in," he said. "But, one at a time. Who'll go first? He didn't say he was feeling very kind. He's been licking his lips a lot since he swallowed up the wicked King the other night. He's been growling a good deal this morning. I wouldn't much like to go into that stable myself tonight. But just as you please. Who'd like to go in first? Don't blame me if he swallows you whole or blasts you into a cinder with the mere terror of his eyes. That's your affair. Now then! Who's first? What about one of you Dwarfs?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哪一个都能进去，”无尾猿说道，“可是，一次只进去一个。谁先进去，他可并不说他是十分仁慈的。自从他在大前天把那邪恶的国王吞下肚子以来，他一直在不断地舔他的嘴唇。今天早晨他曾经大嚎大叫了一阵子。今儿个夜间我自己也不大想进到马厩里去。但，随你们的便。谁愿意第一个进去，如果他把你整个儿吞了下去，或者只是用它的火眼金睛把你烧成灰烬，可别怪我。那是你自己的事情。哦，进来吧！谁第一个进来？你们小矮人先进来一个吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“哈——哈！”无尾猿喊道，“那么你们在开始想到里边有点儿东西了，是不是？哦，一分钟以前你们野兽都吵闹得够响的了。是什么把你们都打成了哑巴？谁第一个进去呀？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But the Beasts all stood looking at one another and began backing away from the stable. Very few tails were wagging now. The Ape waddled to and fro jeering at them. "Ho-ho-ho!" he chuckled. "I thought you were all so eager to see Tashlan face to face! Changed your mind, eh?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但野兽们都站在那儿你看我我看你的，而且开始从马厩后退。现在没有几条尾巴在摇晃了。无尾猿一边大摇大摆地走来走去，一边嘲笑野兽们。“哈―哈―哈！”它抿着嘴笑道，“我想你们大家都急于要面对面地见到塔什兰！如今改变主意了，嗯？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tirian bent his head to hear something that Jill was trying to whisper in his ear. "What do you think is really inside the stable?" she said. "Who knows?" said Tirian. "Two Calormenes with drawn swords, as likely as not, one on each side of the door."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="蒂莲低下头来听吉尔试图在他耳边说的悄悄话。“你认为马厩里确实有什么东西吗，”她说。“谁知道呢？”蒂莲道，“两个卡乐门士兵拿着出鞘的剑，很可能，两边的门口各站着一个兵。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then a most surprising thing happened. Ginger the Cat said in a cool, clear voice, not at all as if he was excited, "I'll go in, if you like."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着就发生了一件最出人意外的事。猫儿金格用冷静、清晰的声音，仿佛压根儿毫不激动地说道：“如果你愿意，我要进去。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And the Cat got up and came out of its place in the crowd, walking primly and daintily, with its tail in the air, not one hair on its sleek coat out of place. It came on till it had passed the fire and was so close that Tirian, from where he stood with his shoulder against the end-wall of the stable, could look right into its face. Its big green eyes never blinked. ("Cool as a cucumber," muttered Eustace. "It knows it has nothing to fear.") The Ape, chuckling and making faces, shuttled across beside the Cat: put up his paw: drew the bolt and opened the door. Tirian thought he could hear the Cat purring as it walked into the dark doorway.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是那猫儿便站起身来，从它在群众中的座位里走将出去，它一直正经地优雅文静地走着，尾巴翘在空中，柔软发亮的皮外套上没有一根毛是不得体的。它继续向前，走过篝火，走得极近了；蒂莲肩膀靠着马厩末端的墙上，站在那儿能仔细打量着猫儿的脸孔。它那碧绿的大眼睛一眨也不眨。（“泰然自若，”尤斯塔斯喃喃而语，“它知道它没有什么可害怕的。”）无尾猿吃吃讪笑，做着鬼脸，拖拖拉拉地过来，站在猫儿身旁，伸出脚爪：拉开门闩，打开马厩的门。蒂莲以为他听见了猫儿走进黑暗门口时呜呜的叫声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Every creature turned and fixed its eyes on the Cat. "Mark their subtleties, Sire," said Poggin to the King. "This cursed cat is in the plot, in the very centre of it. Whatever is in the stable will not hurt him, I'll be bound. Then Ginger will come out again and say that he has seen some wonder."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每一头野兽都转过头来，眼睛牢牢盯着猫儿直瞧。“陛下，留神它们的阴险，”波金对国王说道，“这该死的猫儿参与了阴谋诡计，它是阴谋的核心。不论马厩里有什么东西，都伤不着它，我敢肯定。然后金格会重新从马厩里出来，说是它看到了奇迹。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But Tirian had no time to answer him. The Ape was calling the Cat to come forward. "Ho-ho!" said the Ape. "So you, a pert Puss, would look upon him face to face. Come on, then! I'll open the door for you. Don't blame me if he scares the whiskers off your face. That's your affair."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但蒂莲没有时间回答。无尾猿正叫猫儿出来。“嗬——嗬！”无尾猿说道，“那么，你，一只冒冒失失的猫咪，竟要面对面地见他了。那就来吧，我替你开门。如果他吓得你胡须都从脸上掉下来，你可别怪我。那是你自己的事情。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This was worse. The Ape was knocked head over heels by Ginger coming back out of the stable at top speed. If you had not known he was a cat, you might have thought he was a ginger-coloured streak of lightning. He shot across the open grass, back into the crowd. No one wants to meet a cat in that state. You could see animals getting out of his way to left and right. He dashed up a tree, whisked around, and hung head downwards. His tail was bristled out till it was nearly as thick as his whole body: his eyes were like saucers of green fire: along his back every single hair stood on end.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="事态更糟了。金格从马厩里以最快的速度窜回来，把无尾猿也撞了个四脚朝天。如果你不知道它是只猫儿，你会认为它是一道姜黄色的闪电。它窜过开阔的草地，回到群众中去。谁也不想碰到处于这种状态的猫。你可以看见野兽们往左右闪开，给它让路。它窜上一棵树木，周围弹了一下，身体便倒挂在树枝上。它把尾巴倒竖了起来，几乎跟它整个儿身体一般儿粗大；它的眼睛像碧绿的火焰碟子，它的背上每根毛都挺得笔直。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Aii-aii-aouwee! --" The most horrible caterwaul you ever heard made everyone jump. You have been wakened yourself by cats quarrelling or making love on the roof in the middle of the night: you know the sound.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Peace, friend," said Tirian, for the Captain and the Ape were also whispering and he wanted to hear what they said. He did not succeed, except that he heard the Ape once more whimpering "My head, my head," but he got the idea that those two were almost as puzzled by the cat's behaviour as himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“别做声，朋友。”蒂莲说道，因为卡乐门队长也在和无尾猿窃窃私语，他想听听他们究竟在说些什么。他没听到什么，只不过听到无尾猿再次在呜咽。“我的脑袋，我的脑袋好疼啊。”但他得出了一个想法：这两个家伙，像他自己一样被那猫儿的行动搞迷糊了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">What followed was rather horrible. Tirian felt quite certain (and so did the others) that the Cat was trying to say something: but nothing came out of his mouth except the ordinary, ugly cat-noises you might hear from any angry or frightened old Tom in a backyard in England. And the longer he caterwauled the less like a Talking Beast he looked. Uneasy whimperings and little sharp squeals broke out from among the other Animals.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接下来的事是很可怕的。蒂莲十分有把握地觉得（别人也一样）猫儿正竭力说出一些话来，但它的嘴巴里讲不出人话来，只能发出普普通通的十分难听的猫叫声，在英国的后院里，你可以从任何愤怒或吃惊的猫儿那里听到这种叫声。而且，它鸣叫的时间越长，看上去就越发不像一只说人话的兽类。其他的野兽中间进发出了心神不安的呜咽和微弱的尖叫声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Look, look!" said the voice of the Bear. "It can't talk. It has forgotten how to talk! It has gone back to being a dumb beast. Look at its face." Everyone saw that it was true. And then the greatest terror of all fell upon those Narnians. For every one of them had been taught -- when it was only a chick or a puppy or a cub -- how Aslan at the beginning of the world had turned the beasts of Narnia into Talking Beasts and warned them that if they weren't good they might one day be turned back again and be like the poor witless animals one meets in other countries. "And now it is coming upon us," they moaned.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“瞧，瞧！”野猪的声音说道，“它不能说人话了。它忘记怎样说人话了。它已经倒退成为一只哑巴畜生了。瞧瞧它的脸。”大家看到确实是那样。于是一切恐怖中最大的恐怖落在这些纳尼亚禽兽心上了。因为它们每一个都受过这样的教导——当它们是只小鸡或小狗或幼狐的时候——阿斯兰曾在世界开创之时，把纳尼亚的禽兽变成了会说人话的禽兽，并且警告它们，如果它们行为不端，有朝一日，它们就会重新变回老样子，同人们在其他国家里遇到的可怜而愚蠢的禽兽一模一样。“如今这种变化临到我们头上了。”它们悲叹道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"My Father," came a clear, ringing voice from the left of the crowd. Tirian knew at once that it was one of the Calormenes speaking, for in The Tisroc's army the common soldiers call the officers "My Master" but the officers call their senior officers "My Father". Jill and Eustace didn't know this but, after looking this way and that, they saw the speaker, for of course people at the sides of the crowd were easier to see than people in the middle where the glare of the fire made all beyond it look rather black. He was young and tall and slender, and even rather beautiful in the dark, haughty, Calormene way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我的父亲，”一个清脆响亮的声音从群众的左边传来。蒂莲立刻听出来了，这是一个卡乐门士兵在说话，因为在“蒂斯罗克”的军队里，普通士兵称他们的军官为“我的师父”，而普通军官称他的上级军官为“我的父亲”。吉尔和尤斯塔斯不知道这个规矩，但他们左看右望，终于看到了说话的人，因为在大伙儿边上的人，要比在中间的人容易看得见，中间火光熊熊，使它后面的一切倒显得很黑了。他年轻，高个儿，身材苗条，黑苍苍、自命不凡的卡乐门风度，看上去倒也漂亮。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tirian stood with his hand on his sword-hilt and his head bowed. He was dazed with the horrors of that night. Sometimes he thought it would be best to draw his sword at once and rush upon the Calormenes: then next moment he thought it would be better to wait and see what new turn affairs might take. And now a new turn came.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“别说话，”利什达泰坎说道，“难道我不是你的队长吗，你跟马厩毫不相干。马厩是为纳尼亚群众而设的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Nay, my Father," answered Emeth. "Thou hast said that their Aslan and our Tash are all one. And if that is the truth, then Tash himself is in yonder. And how then sayest thou that I have nothing to do with him? For gladly would I die a thousand deaths if I might look once on the face of Tash."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，我的父亲，”伊梅思答道，“你自己说过，他们的阿斯兰跟我们的塔什兰是二位一体的。如果你说的是真话，那么，塔什神就在那马厩里。所以，你怎么能说我和塔什神毫不相干呢，如果我能当面看到一次塔什神，那么，哪怕死一千次我也乐意。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Emeth's face grew sterner. "Is it then not true that Tash and Aslan are all one?" he asked. "Has the Ape lied to us?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Fool," began Rishda Tarkaan, but at once the Dwarfs began shouting: "Come along, Darkie. Why don't you let him in? Why do you let Narnians in and keep your own people out? What have you got in there that you don't want your own men to meet?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“傻瓜。”利什达泰坎开口道，但小矮人们立刻开始叫喊：“来吧，黑皮。你为什么不让他进去？为什么你放纳尼亚人进去，却把你自己国家的人拦在外面？你在马厩里设了什么机关，所以你不要你的自己人去瞎碰。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tirian and his friends could only see the back of Rishda Tarkaan, so they never knew what his face looked like as he shrugged his shoulders and said, "Bear witness all that I am guiltless of this young fool's blood. Get thee in, rash boy, and make haste."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="蒂莲和他的朋友们只看见利什达泰坎的背影，所以他们不知道他耸耸肩膀时脸上的神色如何：“请大家作证，对这傻瓜的流血，我是无辜的。鲁莽的孩子，你就进去吧，赶快。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then, just as Ginger had done, Emeth came walking forward into the open strip of grass between the bonfire and the stable. His eyes were shining, his face very solemn, his hand was on his sword-hilt, and he carried his head high. Jill felt like crying when she looked at his face. And Jewel whispered in the King's ear, "By the Lion's Mane, I almost love this young warrior, Calormene though he be. He is worthy of a better god than Tash."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着，就像金格一样，伊梅思走上前来，进入簧火与马厩之间的那片开阔的草地。他的眼睛闪闪发光，他的脸色庄重，他的手按在剑柄上，他的头昂得高高的。吉尔望着他的脸时，觉得自己快要哭了。珍宝在国王的耳边低语道：“狮王的旅毛啊，我几乎爱上这年轻的战士了，虽然他是个卡乐门士兵。比塔什更好的神才值得他尊敬哩。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Emeth opened the door and went in, into the black mouth of the stable. He closed the door behind him. Only a few moments passed -- but it seemed longer before the door opened again. A figure in Calormene armour reeled out, fell on its back, and lay still: the door closed behind it. The Captain leaped towards it and bent down to stare at its face. He gave a start of surprise. Then he recovered himself and turned to the crowd, crying out:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伊梅思打开门走进去，进入了马厩漆黑的嘴巴。他关上他背后的门。只过了片刻——但感觉上仿佛时间更长——门又重新打开了。一个穿卡乐门锁子甲的人影儿摇摇晃晃地退出门来，仰面倒在地上，躺在那儿一动也不动了。马厩的门重新关上。队长向那人跳将过去，俯下身来仔细打量他的脸。他吓了一跳。然后他恢复镇静，转脸面向大伙儿，大声喊道：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"We will, we will," said the poor Beasts. But Tirian and his friends stared at the dead Calormene and then at one another. For they, being so close, could see what the crowd, being further off and beyond the fire, could not see: this dead man was not Emeth. He was quite different: an older man, thicker and not so tall, with a big beard.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们要，我们要引为鉴戒的。”可怜的野兽们说道。但，蒂莲和他的朋友们，先盯住死掉的卡乐门士兵仔细打量一番，然后彼此又互相看了一眼。因为他们离尸体很近，能看到大伙儿（离得远，又在簧火的背后）没法儿看到的景象：死人并不是伊梅思。死人截然不同，是个年纪较大的人，身材比较粗大，可不及伊梅思高，还长着一把大胡子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Ho-ho-ho," chuckled the Ape. "Any more? Anyone else want to go in? Well, as you're all shy, I'll choose the next. You, you Boar! On you come. Drive him up, Calormenes. He shall see Tashlan face to face."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嗬—嗬—嗬，”无尾猿吃吃笑道，“还有什么人吗，还有什么人要进来，得了，既然你们大家都不好意思，我就来挑选下一个。野猪，你过来。卡乐门士兵，把他押过来。它得面对面地见见塔什神。”">查看中文翻译</div>
