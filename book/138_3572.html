<div class="line_en">Abbe Marignan's martial name suited him well. He was a tall, thin priest, fanatic, excitable, yet upright. All his beliefs were fixed, never varying. He believed sincerely that he knew his God, understood His plans, desires and intentions.</div>

<div class="line_en">When he walked with long strides along the garden walk of his little country parsonage, he would sometimes ask himself the question: "Why has God done this?" And he would dwell on this continually, putting himself in the place of God, and he almost invariably found an answer. He would never have cried out in an outburst of pious humility: "Thy ways, O Lord, are past finding out."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他在他那所乡下礼拜堂堂长住宅的树荫小径上迈开大步散步时，有时候头脑里涌出一个问题：“上帝为什么造了这东西？”于是他固执地寻觅答案，替上帝设身处地，结果几乎一定是寻得着答案的。世上有些人在一种虔诚的谦逊状态中，免不了喃喃地说：“主，你的计划是深不可测的！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But he hated woman -- hated her unconsciously, and despised her by instinct. He often repeated the words of Christ: "Woman, what have I to do with thee?" and he would add: "It seems as though God, Himself, were dissatisfied with this work of His." She was the tempter who led the first man astray, and who since then had ever been busy with her work of damnation, the feeble creature, dangerous and mysteriously affecting one. And even more than their sinful bodies, he hated their loving hearts.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是他却恨女人，他不自觉地恨女人，并且由于本能作用看不起女人。他时常讲述基督的话，“女人，在你和我之间，可有相同的处所？”末了他还加上一句：“可以说上帝自己也不满意于这种作品。”在他看来，女人比诗人所谈的孩子还不纯洁十二倍。她诱惑了第一个男人拖累了他，并且永远继续她这种堕入地狱的工作，这真是软弱的、危险而又神秘地扰乱人心的生物。并且他憎恨她们那种具有爱力的灵魂，尤甚于憎恨她们那种沉沦了的肉体。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The four seasons corresponded perfectly to the needs of agriculture, and no suspicion had ever come to the priest of the fact that nature has no intentions; that, on the contrary, everything which exists must conform to the hard demands of seasons, climates and matter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="四季对于农事的种种需要是完全相应的；这教士从来不会怀疑到自然原是没有目的的，也就是绝没有怀疑到一切有生命的东西，相反都得服从时代和气候以及物质的必然需要。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">According to his belief, God had created woman for the sole purpose of tempting and testing man. One must not approach her without defensive precautions and fear of possible snares. She was, indeed, just like a snare, with her lips open and her arms stretched out to man.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在他看来，上帝之造女人不过是为了引诱男人和考验男人。所以非带着种种防御性的以及因为陷阱而起的恐惧是不好和她们接近的。在事实上，女人的那向着男人张开的嘴唇和伸出的胳膊简直就是陷阱。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He had no indulgence except for nuns, whom their vows had rendered inoffensive; but he was stern with them, nevertheless, because he felt that at the bottom of their fettered and humble hearts the everlasting tenderness was burning brightly -- that tenderness which was shown even to him, a priest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="仅仅对于那些因为虔信宗教而变成没有害处的女教士，他才存宽大之心；不过却一样强硬地对付她们，因为他觉得，尽管他是一个教士，在她们那颗锁住了的心的深处，在她们那受了委屈的心的深处，那种向他表示的永恒的温和亲爱，依然始终是活跃的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She was a pretty, brainless madcap. When the abbe preached she laughed, and when he was angry with her she would give him a hug, drawing him to her heart, while he sought unconsciously to release himself from this embrace which nevertheless filled him with a sweet pleasure, awakening in his depths the sensation of paternity which slumbers in every man.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她是美貌的，天真的和爱嘲笑的。每逢这位教士说教，她就笑起来；而每逢他对着她生气，她就热烈地拥抱他，紧紧地箍住他，于是他便不知不觉地极力设法来解脱这样的包围，然而这样的包围，却使他尝着了一种甜美的快乐，在他心里唤醒了那种在世上男人心里沉睡了的父性感觉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He felt this cursed tenderness, even in their docility, in the low tones of their voices when speaking to him, in their lowered eyes, and in their resigned tears when he reproved them roughly.

<div class="line_cn" title="他觉得在她们那种比男教士的眼光格外被信仰润湿的眼光里，在她们那种以异性的身分来参加的对上帝的陶醉里，在她们对于基督而施的热爱里，都有温和亲爱的存在，这些事都是使他生气的，因为这是女性的爱情，肉体的爱情；就是在她们的柔顺态度里，在她们和他说话而用的声音的和婉意味里，在她们低垂的眼睛里，在她们因为遇着他用强硬态度相待而忍住的眼泪里，无处不有这种可咒骂的温和亲爱的存在。并且，每逢他抖着道袍从女修道院的门里出来，就伸长了脚步急急走开了，如同逃避危险一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Often, when walking by her side, along the country road, he would speak to her of God, of his God. She never listened to him, but looked about her at the sky, the grass and flowers, and one could see the joy of life sparkling in her eyes. Sometimes she would dart forward to catch some flying creature, crying out as she brought it back: "Look, uncle, how pretty it is! I want to hug it!" And this desire to "hug" flies or lilac blossoms disquieted, angered, and roused the priest, who saw, even in this, the ineradicable tenderness that is always budding in women's hearts.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他时常带着她在身旁从田地里的小路上走，一面老是对她谈到上帝，谈到他的上帝。她几乎没有听见他的话，只去望望天色和花草，眼光里显然露出一种由于生活而起的幸福。有时候她为了追赶一个飞的虫儿就跑起来，随后把虫儿带回来一面喊着：“看呀，舅舅，这东西真好看，我很想吻它一下。”末了这种想和蜜蜂儿或者花苞儿吻一下的热望，竟使这教士不放心了，生气了，激怒了，原来他又从这些地方，发现了这个无法除根的温情总要在所有女人的心里萌发出来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">All day long he was silent, full of anger and indignation. To his priestly hatred of this invincible love was added the exasperation of her spiritual father, of her guardian and pastor, deceived and tricked by a child, and the selfish emotion shown by parents when their daughter announces that she has chosen a husband without them, and in spite of them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在整个白天，他一直不说话，满肚子怒气。因为对着不可克制的爱情，他作为教士已经动了暴怒，此外，他又是道义上的家长、保护人和精神指导者，现在一个女孩子欺骗了他，抢劫了他，玩弄了他，所以他的暴怒更其过度了；这种自私自利气得说不出话来的情形，正是父母遇着女儿不等父母参预又不听父母劝导而径自宣言选择了配偶时所常有的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After dinner he tried to read a little, but could not, growing more and, more angry. When ten o'clock struck he seized his cane, a formidable oak stick, which he was accustomed to carry in his nocturnal walks when visiting the sick. And he smiled at the enormous club which he twirled in a threatening manner in his strong, country fist. Then he raised it suddenly and, gritting his teeth, brought it down on a chair, the broken back of which fell over on the floor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吃过了晚饭，他想勉强去看一点儿书，但他没有能够达到目的；终于越想越气。到了报过10点钟以后，他拿了他的手杖，一根粗大的榆木棍子，一根每逢他在夜里去看病人必定带着防身的粗棍子。随后他那只粗大结实的手掌拿起粗棍子像风车儿一般有威有势地抡起来，一面瞧着它微笑。末了，他忽然擎起了它，咬牙切齿用它敲着一把椅子，那椅子的靠背开了坼，倒在地板上了。">查看中文翻译</div>
