<div class="line_en">It was a perfectly ordinary door, no different from any other door on the first two floors of the hotel. It was dark gray, halfway down a corridor that ran at right angles to the main second-floor hallway. The numbers on the door looked no different from the house numbers on the Boulder apartment building they had lived in. A 2, a 1, and a 7. Big deal. Just below them was a tiny glass circle, a peephole. Danny had tried several of them. From the inside you got a wide, fish-eye view of the corridor. From outside you could screw up your eye seven ways to Sunday and still not see a thing. A dirty gyp.</div>

<div class="line_en">The kitchen was his favorite place in the hotel, and he guessed that Mommy and Daddy must feel the same way, because after trying their meals in the dining room for three days or so, they had begun eating in the kitchen by mutual consent, setting up chairs around Dick Hallorann's butcher block, which was almost as big as their dining room table back in Stovington, anyway. The dining room had been too depressing, even with the lights on and the music playing from the tape cassette system in the office.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="厨房是饭店里他最喜欢的地方，而且他猜妈妈和爸爸也这样认为，因为在餐厅里吃了三天饭后，他们一致同意就在厨房用餐。他们在迪克·哈洛伦切肉的砧板周围搭上椅子，做成了一张餐桌，不过这张砧板足有他们斯托文顿家中的餐桌那么大。餐厅的气氛十分压抑，即便开着灯而且有办公室的盒式磁带音响系统传来的音乐相伴也是如此。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">You were still just one of three people sitting at a table surrounded by dozens of other tables, all empty, all covered with those transparent plastic dustcloths. Mommy said it was like having dinner in the middle of a Horace Walpole novel, and Daddy had laughed and agreed. Danny had no idea who Horace Walpole was, but he did know that Mommy's cooking had begun to taste better as soon as they began to eat it in the kitchen. He kept discovering little flashes of Dick Hallorann's personality lying around, and they reassured him like a warm touch.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们仨坐在一张餐桌旁，包围在几十张空荡荡的铺着遮灰尘的透明塑料薄膜的餐桌中间。妈妈说这情景就像在一部贺拉斯·渥尔波的长篇小说中吃饭一样，爸爸笑着表示同意。丹尼不知道贺拉斯·渥尔波是谁，但他却清楚地知道，他们改到厨房吃饭后，妈妈做的饭菜味道好多了。他一直在寻找周围潜藏的体现哈洛伦个性的哪怕是一丁点儿的影子，这好像能使他感到踏实些。">查看中文翻译</div>

He had written to a lawyer in Boulder, enclosing the snaps of Danny's hand, and the lawyer had called back two days ago -- that had put Jack in a foul temper all afternoon. The lawyer doubted if the company that had manufactured the bug bomb could be sued successfully because there was only Jack to testify that he had followed directions printed on the package. Jack had asked the lawyer if they couldn't purchase some others and test them for the same defect. Yes, the lawyer said, but the results were highly doubtful even if all the test bombs malfunctioned. He told Jack of a case that involved an extension ladder company and a man who had broken his back. Wendy had commiserated with Jack, but privately she had just been glad that Danny had gotten off as cheaply as he had. It was best to leave lawsuits to people who understood them, and that did not include the Torrances. And they had seen no more wasps since.</div>

<div class="line_en">But he hadn't had fun. He had wandered aimlessly around the hotel, poking into the maids' closets and the janitor's rooms, looking for something interesting, not finding it, a small boy padding along a dark blue carpet woven with twisting black lines. He had tried a room door from time to time, but of course they were all locked. The passkey was hanging down in the office, he knew where, but Daddy had told him he shouldn't touch that.

<div class="line_en">There was nothing aimless about it after all. He had been drawn to Room 217 by a morbid kind of curiosity. He remembered a story Daddy had read to him once when he was drunk. That had been a long time ago, but the story was just as vivid now as when Daddy had read it to him. Mommy had scolded Daddy and asked what he was doing, reading a three-year-old baby something so horrible. The name of the story was Bluebeard. That was clear in his mind too, because he had thought at first Daddy was saying Bluebird, and there were no bluebirds in the story, or birds of any kind for that matter. Actually the story was about Bluebeard's wife, a pretty lady that had corn-colored hair like Mommy. After Bluebeard married her, they lived in a big and ominous castle that was not unlike the Overlook. And every day Bluebeard went off to work and every day he would tell his pretty little wife not to look in a certain room, although the key to that room was hanging right on a hook, just like the passkey was hanging on the office wall downstairs. Bluebeard's wife had gotten more and more curious about the locked room. She tried to peep through the keyhole the way Danny had tried to look through Room 217's peephole with similar unsatisfying results.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="毕竟，无论什么都不是无目的的。他被一种病态的好奇心吸引到了217房间。他记起了爸爸在一次酒醉后给他讲过的一个故事。那是很久以前的事了，但这个故事还像当初爸爸讲给他的时候那样栩栩如生。妈妈责备了爸爸，问他知不知道自己在干什么，竟给刚满三岁的孩子讲这么可怕的东西。他记得很清楚，故事的名字叫《蓝胡子》，因为他开始以为爸爸说的是《蓝屋子》，可故事中没有提到蓝色的屋子或别的什么颜色的屋子。实际上，故事是关于蓝胡子的妻子的，一个跟妈妈一样有栗色头发的漂亮女人。她和蓝胡子结婚后住在一座阴森的大城堡里，城堡和远望饭店差不多。蓝胡子每天外出工作，每天他都叮嘱他娇小漂亮的妻子不要到某一间屋子里，虽然那间屋子的钥匙就挂在钩子上，就像饭店的万能钥匙就挂在楼下办公室里一样。蓝胡子的妻子对那间锁得紧紧的房间感到越来越好奇。她想通过钥匙孔往里偷看，就像丹尼想从窥视孔往217房间里看一样，可结果也一样，什么都看不见。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Terrified, she had turned to flee from the room and the castle, only to discover Bluebeard standing in the doorway, his terrible eyes blazing. "I told you not to enter this room," Bluebeard said, unsheathing his sword. "Alas, in your curiosity you are like the other seven, and though I loved you best of all your ending shall be as was theirs. Prepare to die, wretched woman!" It seemed vaguely to Danny that the story had a happy ending, but that had paled to insignificance beside the two dominant images: the taunting, maddening locked door with some great secret behind it, and the grisly secret itself, repeated more than half a dozen times. The locked door and behind it the heads, the severed beads.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她大惊失色，转身正要逃离这个房间和城堡，却发现蓝胡子站在门口，眼露凶光。“我告诉过你不要到这里来，”蓝胡子一边说，一边从剑鞘里拔出剑来。“唉，你跟其他七个女人一样充满好奇心，虽然你是我最喜欢的女人，可你的下场也只得跟她们一样。准备好去死吧，可怜的女人！”丹尼仿佛记得故事有一个喜剧性的结局，但这个结局在下面两个占压倒性优势的印象面前显得黯然失色：遮挡着某种巨大的秘密的门和使人丧魂落魄的可怕的秘密本身。这两幅图画在他脑海中反复出现了七八次，紧锁的房门和门背后的头颅——被割断的头颅。">查看中文翻译</div>

The severed heads of Bluebeard's seven previous wives were in the room, each one on its own pedestal, the eyes turned up to whites, the mouths unhinged and gaping in silent screams. They were somehow balanced on necks ragged from the broadsword's decapitating swing, and there was blood running down the pedestals.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他停下了脚步，但一时还不明白究竟是什么东西使他停了下来。接着他记起来了：在拐角处，在往楼梯间走的路上，一条老式的灭火软管盘成一卷挂在墙上，像一条蜷曲的蛇。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They weren't chemical-type extinguishers at all, Daddy said, although there were several of those in the kitchen. These were the forerunner of the modern sprinkler systems. The long canvas hoses hooked directly into the Overlook's plumbing system, and by turning a single valve you could become a one-man fire department. Daddy said that the chemical extinguishers, which sprayed foam or CO, were much better. The chemicals smothered fires, took away the oxygen they needed to burn, while a high-pressure spray might just spread the flames around.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爸爸说，饭店的灭火器，除了厨房里那几台，都不是化学灭火器，而是新式喷水灭火器的前身。这些长长的帆布软管直接跟饭店的管道系统相连，只要转开阀门你就可以成为一个单枪匹马的消防队。爸爸说，喷射泡沫或二氧化碳的化学灭火器要好得多。化学灭火器是通过隔开燃烧需要的氧气来灭火的，而高压水流则可能弄巧成拙，使火势蔓延得更快。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The extinguisher was there, a fiat hose folded back a dozen times on itself, the red tank attached to the wall. Above it was an ax in a glass case like a museum exhibit, with white words printed on a red background: IN CASE OF EMERGENCY, BREAK GLASS. Danny could read the word EMERGENCY, which was also the name of one of his favorite TV shows, but was unsure of the rest. But he didn't like the way the word was used in connection with that long fiat hose. EMERGENCY was', fire, explosions, car crashes, hospitals, sometimes death. And he didn't like the way that hose hung so blandly on the wall. When he was alone, he always skittered past these extinguishers as fast as he could. No particular reason. It just felt better to go fast. It felt safer.</div>

<div class="line_en">Daddy said that Mr. Ullman should replace the old-fashioned hoses right along with the old-fashioned boiler, but Mr. Ullman would probably do neither because he was a CHEAP PRICK. Danny knew that this was one of the worst epithets his father could summon. It was applied to certain doctors, dentists, and appliance repairmen, and also to the head of his English Department at Stovington, who had disallowed some of Daddy's book orders because he said the books would put them over budget. "Over budget, hell," he had fumed to Wendy -- Danny had been listening from his bedroom where he was supposed to be asleep. "He's just saving the last five hundred bucks for himself, the CHEAP PRICK."</div>

<div class="line_en">When he was ten steps away, the brass nozzle suddenly rolled off the fat loop it had been lying (sleeping?) on and fell to the hall carpet with a dull thump. It lay there, the dark bore of its muzzle pointing at Danny. He stopped immediately, his shoulders twitching forward with the suddenness of his scare. His blood thumped thickly in his ears and temples. His mouth had gone dry and sour, his hands curled into fists. Yet the nozzle of the hose only lay there, its brass casing glowing mellowly, a loop of flat canvas leading back up to the red-painted frame bolted to the wall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他离拐角还剩十步时，灭火器的黄铜喷嘴突然从那盘软管上落下来（它是躺在那里的？还是睡在那里的？），扑地一声掉在过道地毯上。喷嘴躺在那里，黑洞洞的嘴巴直指着丹尼。他立即停住了脚步，突然的惊吓使他肩膀哆嗦了一下。体内涌流的血液重重地撞击着他的耳鼓和太阳穴，嘴巴又干又涩，一双小手握成了拳头。可软管喷嘴躺在地上，根本就没动，喷嘴的铜套闪着柔和的光泽，扁平的帆布卷吊在墙壁上的红漆架子上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now, heart thumping loudly in his chest, he came around the corner and looked down the hall past the extinguisher to the stairs. Mommy was down there, sleeping. And if Daddy was back from his walk, he would probably be sitting in the kitchen, eating a sandwich and reading a book. He would just walk right past that old extinguisher and go downstairs.</div>

<div class="line_en">Suddenly he knew that he was nearly frozen with terror; if he did not make his feet go now, they would become locked to the carpet and he would stay here, staring at the black hole in the center of the brass nozzle like a bird staring at a snake, he would stay here until his daddy found him and then what would happen?</div>

<div class="line_en">Danny took another step, and another. His breath was dry and harsh in his throat. Panic was close now.

<div class="line_en">With a high moan, he made himself run. As he reached the hose, some trick of the light made the nozzle seem to move, to revolve as if to strike, and he leaped high in the air above it; in his panicky state it seemed that his legs pushed him nearly all the way to the ceiling, that he could feel the stiff back hairs that formed his cowlick brushing the hallway's plaster ceiling, although later he knew that couldn't have been so.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他呻吟一声，开始撒腿跑起来。他靠近软管时，由于光线作怪，喷嘴似乎动起来了，它扬起头来，好像要出击，他高高地跳起来跃过了喷嘴。惊恐之中，他觉得双腿直把他送上了天花板，觉得后脑勺翘起的发梢擦上了过道天花板上的石灰，尽管后来他知道那是不可能的。">查看中文翻译</div>
