<div class="line_en">The ship of the Overlords came sliding in along its glowing meteor-trail through the heart of Carina. It had begun its mad deceleration among the outer planets, but even while passing Mars it had still possessed an appreciable fraction of the velocity of light. Slowly the immense fields surrounding the Sun were absorbing its momentum, while for a million kilometres behind, the stray energies of the stardrive were painting the heavens with fire.</div>

<div class="line_en">This time he was no longer a stowaway, hidden in a secret chamber. He stood behind the three pilots (why, he wondered, did they need so many?) watching the patterns come and go on the great screen that dominated the control room. The colours and shapes it showed were meaningless to him: he assumed that they were conveying information which in a vessel designed by men would have been displayed on banks of meters. But sometimes the screen showed the surrounding star-fields, and soon, he hoped, it would be showing Earth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这次他没有躲在暗舱里，他就站在三名驾驶员（为什么需要这么多？）身后，望着那个巨大的屏幕，上面各种图形不停地变换着，不知道那些图形的颜色和形状代表什么意思，也许和飞船上的仪表作用是一样的。有时，屏幕上也会出现周围的太空，地球要等到什么时候才能出现呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He was glad to be home, despite the effort he had devoted to escaping from it. In these few months he had grown up. He had seen so much, travelled so far, and now was weary for his own familiar world. He understood, now, why the Overlords had sealed Earth from the stars. Humanity still had very far to go before it could play any part in the civilization he had glimpsed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当初自己费了好大的劲儿才离开地球，现在却盼着早点回去。短短几个月，自己人成熟了，见识也增加了，游历的地方也多了，也终于明白了外星人为什么不让地球上的人到太空去——人类要在那样的文明世界中发挥作用还差得太远。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It might be -- though this he refused to accept -- that mankind could never be more than an inferior species, preserved in an out-of-the-way zoo with the Overlords as keepers. Perhaps that was what Vindarten had meant when he gave Jan that ambiguous warning, just before his departure. "Much may have happened," the Overlord had said, "in the time that has passed on your planet. You may not know your world when you see it again."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="人类就像一种低级生物，养在偏僻的动物园里，由外星人照看着。扬不愿意接受这样的想法，但情况很可能就是这样。莞达滕送别自己时警告说：“你离开的这段时间地球可能发生了很大变化。你再看到它时，可能都认不出来了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Perhaps not, thought Jan: eighty years was a long time, and though he was young and adaptable, he might find it hard to understand all the changes that had come to pass.

<div class="line_en">They had treated him well, as he had assumed they would. Of the outward journey he had known nothing: when the injection had worn off and he had emerged, the ship was already entering the Overlord system. He had climbed out of his fantastic hiding-place, and found to his relief that the oxygen set was not needed. The air was thick and heavy, but he could breathe without difficulty. He had found himself in the ship's enormous red-lit hold, among countless other packing-cases and all the impedimenta one would expect on a liner of space or of sea. It had taken him almost an hour to find his way to the control room and to introduce himself to the crew.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正如自己当初预料的，外星人很好地款待了自己。离开地球的时候，自己对未来的旅程一无所知，药效过去之后醒过来，飞船已经进入了外星人的星系。他钻出暗舱，发现氧气设备根本不需要，大大松了口气，只是空气的密度很大，很重，但一点问题也没有。货舱里亮着红色的光，周围堆着箱子及各类行李，和飞机、轮船上的货舱差不多。花了近一个小时的时间，他才找到通往驾驶室的路，然后他向那些外星人介绍自己。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Their lack of surprise had puzzled him: he knew that the Overlords showed few emotions, but he had expected some reaction. Instead, they simply continued with their work, watching the great screen and playing with the countless keys on their control panels. It was then that he knew that they were landing, for from time to time the image of a planet -- larger at each appearance -- would flash upon the screen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们竟然没有一丝吃惊的表情，虽说他们面无表情早在预料之中，但多少该有点什么反应呀。他们只是继续做自己的事，看着屏幕，操纵着控制板上的按键。他们正在着陆。屏幕上一颗行星不停地闪现，一次比一次大。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And then, in unison, the three Overlords had risen from their seats, and he knew that the voyage was over. They did not speak to their passenger or to each other, and when one of them beckoned to him to follow, Jan realized something that he should have thought of before. There might well be no one here, at this end of Karellen's enormously long supply line, who understood a word of English.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着，三个外星人同时站起身来，航行结束了。他们既没有和他讲话，彼此间也没有交谈，只是其中一个示意他跟在后面，扬才恍然大悟，自己早该想到这一点：他们都不懂英语。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They watched him gravely as the great doors opened before his eager eyes. This was the supreme moment of his life: now he was to be the first human being ever to look upon a world lit by another sun. The ruby light of NGS 549672 came flooding into the ship, and there before him lay the planet of the Overlords.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="飞船巨大的门打开了，扬迫不及待地向外张望，那三个外星人只是静静地看着他。这是自己生命中最关键的时刻，看到沐浴在另一个太阳下的世界，自己是第一个人。NGS549672上空的阳光照进了船舱，前面就是外星人的星球。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What had he expected? He was not sure. Vast buildings, cities whose towers were lost among the clouds, machines beyond imagination -- these would not have surprised him. Yet what he saw was an almost featureless plain, reaching out to an unnaturally close horizon, and broken only by three more of the Overlords' ships, a few kilometres away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="自己想看到什么？高耸入云的建筑，城市的高塔，神奇的各类机械？这一切都不会让人吃惊，可眼前却是一个没有任何特征的平原，平原尽头的那条地平线很近很近。几公里之外停着三艘飞船。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yet there was never the slightest sense of motion or acceleration -- only a perfectly constant gravity, which he judged to be about a fifth of Earth's. The immense forces that drove the ship must have been compensated with exquisite precision.</div>

<div class="line_en">For a moment Jan felt a surge of disappointment. Then he shrugged his shoulders, realizing that, after all, one would expect to find a space-port in some such remote and uninhabited region as this.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="扬失望了，但马上想起航空站本应该建在这样一个无人居住的偏僻地方。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was cold, though not uncomfortably so. The light from the great red sun low down on the horizon was quite ample for human eyes, but Jan wondered how long it would be before he yearned for greens and blues. Then he saw that enormous, wafer-thin crescent reaching up the sky like a great bow placed beside the sun. He stared at it for a long time before he realized that his journey was not yet altogether ended. That was the world of the Overlords. This must be its satellite, merely the base from which their vessels operated.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="外面很冷，不过并不难受。巨大的红太阳低低地挂在地平线上方，照亮了周围的一切，不知什么时候能看到自己企盼的绿色和蓝色。一弯细细的大月牙升上天空，像一把巨大的弓挂在太阳边上。扬定睛一看，原来那才是外星人的星球，自己的旅程还没有结束——这里可能只是一颗作为飞船停靠基地的卫星。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They had taken him across in a ship no larger than a terrestrial airliner. Feeling a pygmy, he had climbed up into one of the great seats to try and see something of the approaching planet through the observation windows.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那些外星人带着他往另一艘飞船走去，那飞船和飞机差不多大小。像个小矮人一样，他费劲地爬上一把大椅子，透过窗户观望那个越来越近的外星世界。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The journey was so swift that he had time to make out few details on the expanding globe beneath. Even so near to home, it seemed, the Overlords used some version of the stardrive, for in a matter of minutes they were falling down through a deep, cloud-flecked atmosphere. When the doors opened, they stepped out into a vaulted chamber with a roof that must have swung swiftly shut behind them, for there was no sign of any entrance overhead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="旅途很短，他还没有来得及看清下面的那个星球，旅程就结束了。离家这么近了，外星人好像仍然使用了太空飞行的技术，短短几分钟时间，他们就穿过飘着云朵的厚厚的大气层降落了。飞船的舱门开了，他们从屋顶进入了一幢建筑。扬没有发现拱形房顶上有任何入口的痕迹，可能他们刚进去，屋顶就快速闭合了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was no way he could get out of the building, because the great doors had no visible controls. When an Overlord walked up to them, they simply opened. Jan had tried the same trick, had waved objects high in the air to interrupt any controlling light-beam, had tried everything he could imagine -- with no result at all. He realized that a man from the Stone Age, lost in a modern city building, might be equally helpless. Once he had tried to walk out when one of the Overlords left, but had been gently shooed back. As he was very anxious not to annoy his hosts, he did not persist.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="扬找不到门的开关，没有办法出去。外星人走来时，门自动就开了。他试着举起东西来回挥舞，希望能截断控制门开关的光束把门打开，也试过其他种种办法，都失败了。他算明白了，一个石器时代的人在现代化的城市大楼里也会同样无助。有一次他试图跟在一个外星人后面出去，却被轻声撵了回来——他不想激怒那些人，就没有坚持。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It would be more than frustrating, thought Jan, if the only Overlords who spoke his language were all back on Earth. He could only wait and hope for the best. Surely some scientist, some expert on alien races, would come and take charge of him! Or was he so unimportant that no one could be bothered?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果所有懂英语的外星人都到地球上去了，那才更糟糕呢！现在他只能等待，只能祈祷某个外星科学家、专家会来照管自己，自己还不至于惨到他们不屑一顾的地步吧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was two days before Jan left this building. He was an unexpected consignment, and they had nowhere to put him. To make matters worse, not one of the Overlords could understand English. Communication was practically impossible, and Jan realized bitterly that getting in touch with an alien race was not so easy as it was so often depicted in fiction. Sign language proved singularly unsuccessful, for it depended too much on a body of gestures, expressions and attitudes which the Overlords and mankind did not possess in common.</div>

<div class="line_en">Once Vindarten had taken charge of him, Jan had no more worries. He also had no opportunity of doing the things he wished, for almost all his time was spent meeting Overlord scientists anxious to carry out obscure tests with complicated instruments. Jan was very wary of these machines, and after one session with some kind of hypnotic device had a splitting headache for several hours. He was perfectly willing to cooperate, but was not sure if his investigators realized his limitations, both mental and physical. It was certainly a long time before he could convince them that he had to sleep at regular intervals.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有了莞达滕的照顾，扬放心了，但他还是没有时间做自己想做的事，绝大多数的时间，外星人都在利用各种复杂的仪器对他进行各种测试。他对这些仪器心存恐惧，一次经过催眠仪器的测试后他头痛了好几个小时，就像要裂开一样。他很乐意合作，只是不知道那些外星人是否知道自己在脑力和体力上都是有限的，他费了很长时间才让他们相信自己需要定期睡觉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Vindarten arrived before Jan had begun to get desperate. The Overlord spoke very bad English, much too rapidly, but improved with amazing speed. In a few days they were able to talk together with little trouble on any subject that did not demand a specialized vocabulary.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在快要心灰意冷的时候，莞达滕来了。他的英语很差劲，讲得又快，但没几天，就有了很大进步，他们可以进行日常的交流了，只是不能谈专业术语。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Between these investigations, he caught momentary glimpses of the city, and realized how difficult -- and dangerous -- it would be for him to travel around in it. Streets were practically non-existent, and there seemed to be no surface transport. This was the home of creatures who could fly, and who had no fear of gravity. It was nothing to come without warning upon a vertiginous drop of several hundred metres, or to find that the only entrance into a room was an opening high up in the wall. In a hundred ways, Jan began to realize that the psychology of a race with wings must be fundamentally different from that of earthbound creatures.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在试验的间歇，他才有时间到处看着。他发现自己生活在这样一座城市中是一件多么困难又多么危险的事，没有街道，也没有任何交通工具，这个世界属于会飞的生物，不论是从几百米高空落下来，还是从墙上高处的入口进入房间，这个长着翅膀的种族和地球上的人在心理上有着本质的区别。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The architecture of the Overlords was bleakly functional: Jan saw no ornaments, nothing that did not serve a purpose, even though that purpose was often beyond his understanding. If a man from mediaeval times could have seen this red-lit city, and the beings moving through it, he would certainly have believed himself in Hell. Even Jan, for all his curiosity and scientific detachment, sometimes found himself on the verge of unreasoning terror. The absence of a single familiar reference point can be utterly unnerving even to the coolest and clearest minds.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="外星人的建筑都很强调功能，看不见任何装饰品，每样物品都有特定的用途，只是有些东西的用途扬不清楚。如果一个中世纪的人看到这样一个沐浴在红色阳光中的城市和城市中飞来飞去的生物，肯定会相信自己身陷地狱。就是扬这么一个好奇、理智的人有时也发现自己陷入了莫名的恐慌中，始终看不到任何熟悉的东西足以让一个最冷静、最有条理的人都感到烦躁不安。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was strange to see the Overlords flying like great birds among the towers of their city, their pinions moving with slow, powerful beats. And there was a scientific problem here. This was a large planet -- larger than Earth. Yet its gravity was low, and Jan wondered why it had so dense an atmosphere. He questioned Vindarten on this, and discovered, as he had half expected, that this was not the original planet of the Overlords. They had evolved on a much smaller world and then conquered this one, changing not only its atmosphere but even its gravity.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="奇怪的是，看着那些外星人像巨鸟一般拍打着有力的翅膀，从容地穿梭于城市的高楼之间，扬想起一个问题来，这颗行星比地球大得多，重力却很小，空气密度又很大，向莞达滕请教，才知道原来正如自己所猜测的。这不是他们本来的星球，他们原来的那个要小得多。他们在征服这个星球之后，改变了它的大气和重力。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jan also sensed that the world of the Overlords was full of sounds that he could not hear. Occasionally he caught complex rhythmical patterns racing up and down through the audible spectrum, to vanish at the upper or lower edge of hearing. Vindarten did not seem to understand what Jan meant by music, so he was never able to solve this problem to his satisfaction.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="扬还感觉到这个世界里充满了各种各样的声音，但自己却听不到。偶尔他能从声谱图上看到复杂的图形有节奏地上下变动，最终消失在最高音或最低音上。莞达滕不能理解他说的音乐是怎么回事，所以也不能解答这个问题。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The city was not very large: it was certainly far smaller then London or New York had been at their heyday. According to Vindarten, there were several thousand such cities scattered over the planet, each one designed for some specific purpose. On Earth, the closest parallel to this place would have been a university town -- except that the degree of specialization had gone much further. This entire city was devoted, Jan soon discovered, to the study of alien cultures.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个城市不是很大，比全盛时期的伦敦和纽约小多了。莞达滕说这个星球上有好几千个这样的城市，每个城市都有特殊的功能，和地球上的大学城类似，但这里专业的划分要细得多。扬很快就发现这个城市专门研究外星文化。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And there was much he did not understand, and which Vindarten could or would not attempt to explain. What were those flashing lights and changing shapes, the things that flickered through the air so swiftly that he could never be certain of their existence? They could have been something tremendous and awe-inspiring -- or as spectacular yet trivial as the neon signs of old-time Broadway.</div>

<div class="line_en">In one of their first trips outside the bare cell in which Jan lived, Vindarten had taken him to the museum. It had given Jan a much needed psychological boost to find himself in a place whose purpose he could fully understand. Apart from the scale upon which it was built, this museum might well have been on Earth. They had taken a long time to reach it, falling steadily on a great platform that moved like a piston in a vertical cylinder of unknown length. There were no visible controls, and the sense of acceleration at the beginning and ending of the descent was quite noticeable. Presumably the Overlords did not waste their compensating field devices for domestic uses. Jan wondered if the whole interior of this world was riddled with excavations: and why had they limited the size of the city, going underground instead of outwards? That was just another of the enigmas he never solved.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莞达滕有一次带他去博物馆。能够找到这样一个自己还知道用途的地方，扬心里格外激动。这座博物馆除了尺寸更大之外，其他的都和地球上的博物馆一样。他们花了很长时间才飞到博物馆，落到一个平台上，那平台很像汽缸中可以上下移动的活塞，没有任何操纵按钮，在降落开始和结束时能明显感受到速度的变化，外星人在太空飞行中使用的引力补偿装置在日常生活中没有普遍使用。为什么使用这种垂直上下的设备呢？这个星球的地下很可能全被挖空了，他们为什么要限制城市的规模呢？为什么要往地下发展而不是往外扩展呢？扬百思不得其解。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One could have spent a lifetime exploring these colossal chambers. Here was the loot of planets, the achievements of more civilizations than Jan could guess. But there was no time to see much. Vindarten placed him carefully on a strip of flooring that at first sight seemed an ornamental pattern. Then Jan remembered that there were no ornaments here -- and at the same time, something invisible grasped him gently and hurried him forward. He was moving past the great display cases, past vistas of unimaginable worlds, at a speed of twenty or thirty kilometres an hour.</div>

<div class="line_en">They must have travelled several kilometres before Jan's guide grasped him again, and with a surge of his great wings lifted him away from whatever force was propelling them. Before them stretched a huge, half-empty hail, flooded with a familiar light that Jan had not seen since leaving Earth. It was faint, so that it would not pain the sensitive eyes of the Overlords, but it was, unmistakably, sunlight. Jan would never have believed that anything so simple or so commonplace could have evoked such yearning in his heart.</div>

<div class="line_en">So this was the exhibit for Earth. They walked for a few metres past a beautiful model of Paris, past art-treasures from a dozen centuries grouped incongruously together, past modem calculating machines and paleolithic axes, past television receivers and Hero of Alexandra's steam-turbine. A great doorway opened ahead of them, and they were in the office of the Curator for Earth.</div>

<div class="line_en">Was he seeing a human being for the first time? Jan wondered.

<div class="line_en">Jan had spent several hours here, talking into a recording device while the Overlords presented various terrestrial objects to him. Many of these, he discovered to his shame, he could not identify. His ignorance of his own race and its achievements was enormous: he wondered if the Overlords, for all their superb mental gifts, could really grasp the complete pattern of human culture.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="扬在那里一待就是几个小时。他们拿出不同的东西给他看，然后让他对着一台录音设备解释。大多数的东西他都不认识，真是害臊，对自己的种族及其成就竟如此无知，不知道这些外星人凭着他们超常的天赋能不能了解整个人类文化。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Vindarten took him out of the museum by a different route. Once again they floated effortlessly through great vaulted corridors, but this time they were moving past the creations of nature, not of conscious mind. Sullivan, thought Jan, would have given his life to be here, to see what wonders evolution had wrought on a hundred worlds. But Sullivan, he remembered, was probably already dead.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then, without any warning, they were on a galley high above a large circular chamber, perhaps a hundred metres across. As usual, there was no protective parapet, and for a moment Jan hesitated to go near the edge.

<div class="line_en">It was lifeless, of course -- not, as he had thought in that first moment of panic, consciously staring up at him. It filled almost all that great circular space, and the ruby light gleamed and shifted in its crystal depths. It was a single giant eye.</div>

<div class="line_en">Vindarten could tell him little: this was not his field of knowledge, and he was not particularly curious. From the Overlord's description, Jan built up a picture of a cyclopean beast living among the asteroidal rubble of some distant sun, its growth uninhibited by gravity, depending for food and life upon the range and resolving power of its single eye.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莞达滕能告诉他的东西不多，他不是这方面的专家，也不感兴趣，但扬还是知道了这样的独眼巨怪生活在另一个恒星系中，其生长完全不受重力限制，全凭那只独眼的视线远近和分辨能力来获得食物，维持生命。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His heart was still pounding violently as he stared down once more at that monstrous eye. Of course, it might have been a model, enormously enlarged as were microbes and insects in terrestrial museums. Yet even as he asked the question, Jan knew, with a sickening certainty, that it was no larger than life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="扬再次往下看，那只巨大的独眼仍然让自己心悸不已，它可能是一个放大的模型，就像地球上的博物馆里的微生物和昆虫一样。他向莞达滕提出这个问题，马上就意识到这只巨眼完全是真实尺寸。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There seemed no limit to what Nature could do if she was pressed, and Jan felt an irrational pleasure at discovering something which the Overlords would not attempt. They had brought a full-sized whale from Earth -- but they had drawn the line at this.</div>

<div class="line_en">And there was the time when he had gone up, endlessly up, until the walls of the elevator had faded through opalescence into a crystal transparency. He was standing, it seemed, unsupported among the uppermost peaks of the city, with nothing to protect him from the abyss. But he felt no more vertigo than one does in an aeroplane, for there was no sense of contact with the distant ground. He was above the clouds, sharing the sky with a few pinnacles of metal or stone. A rose-red sea, the cloud-layer rolled sluggishly beneath him. There were two pale and tiny moons in the sky, not far from the sombre sun. Near the centre of that bloated red disc was a small, dark shadow, perfectly circular. It might have been a sunspot, or another moon in transit.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他站在电梯里开始上行，一直往上，过了好长时间，电梯的墙壁由乳白色变得像水晶般透明，他好像独自站立在城市的高塔之间，虽然没有任何东西保护，却和乘飞机一样，纵然没有接触地面，也不感到害怕。他在云层之上，身边是金属或石头的塔尖，天空是一片玫瑰红的海洋，云层在脚下懒洋洋地翻滚，离太阳不远的地方挂着两个颜色淡淡的小月球，太阳的中心部分有一片深色的圆形小阴影，可能是太阳黑子，也可能是另一颗运行中的月球。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And then, slowly, the mountain began to change. When he saw it first, it was a dull and almost sinister red, with a few faint markings near its crown that he could not clearly distinguish. He was trying to focus on them when he realized that they were moving…</div>

<div class="line_en">When he had turned half-circle he saw the mountain. It was not on the horizon, but beyond it -- a single serrated peak, climbing up over the edge of the world, its lower slopes hidden as the bulk of an iceberg is concealed below the water-line. He tried to guess its size, and failed completely. Even on a world with gravity as low as this, it seemed hard to believe that such mountains could exist. Did the Overlords, he wondered, sport themselves upon its slopes and sweep like eagles around those immense buttresses?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他掉过头，看到一座大山，不在地平线上，而是在地平线之外。一个锯齿状的山峰高耸在这个世界的外沿，大山的下面部分被挡住了，就像水上漂浮的冰山群，大部分在水下，实在无法想象这座山的大小，一个重力如此小的世界，居然存在这样的大山。这些外星人会像鹰一样围绕它飞翔，锻炼身体吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jan slowly moved his gaze along the horizon.

<div class="line_en">At first he could not believe his eyes. Then he forced himself to remember that all his preconceived ideas were worthless here: he must not let his mind reject any message his senses brought into the hidden chamber of the brain. He must not try to understand -- only to observe. Understanding would come later, or not at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他难以相信自己的眼睛，提醒自己以往的看法在这儿都没用，不能盲目排斥所看到的和听到的一切，自己只能观察，不能试图去理解，理解或许可以晚些时候进行，或许根本就无法理解。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The mountain -- he still thought of it as such, for there was no other word that could serve -- seemed to be alive. He remembered that monstrous eye in its buried vault -- but no, that was inconceivable. It was not organic life that he was watching: it was not even, be suspected, matter as he knew it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他找不到一个合适的词来形容那个东西，只能用“山”这个词。它像活了一样，扬又想起了博物馆里的那只独眼，不，那是不可能的。他看到的不会是一个有机生命，也不会是自己知道的任何物质形式。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The sombre red was brightening to an angrier hue. Streaks of vivid yellow appeared, so that for a moment Jan felt he was looking at a volcano pouring streams of lava down on to the land beneath. But these streams, as he could tell by occasional flecks and mottlings, were moving upwards.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山上暗淡的红色正在变亮，似乎一股怒气正在酝酿，黄色的条纹出现了，好像变成了一座正在喷发的火山，一条条的岩浆从山上流下来，但仔细观察这些岩流的斑痕和颜色，发现它们实际上是从山下流到山上去的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now something else was rising out of the ruby clouds around the mountain's base. It was a huge ring, perfectly horizontal and perfectly circular -- and it was the colour of all that Jan had left so far behind, for the skies of Earth had held no lovelier blue. Nowhere else on the world of the Overlords had he seen such hues, and his throat contracted with the longing and the loneliness they evoked.</div>

<div class="line_en">The ring was expanding as it climbed. It was higher than the mountain now, and its nearer arc was sweeping swiftly towards him. Surely, thought Jan, it must be a vortex of some kind -- a smoke-ring already many kilometres across. But it showed none of the rotation he expected, and it seemed to grow no less solid as its size increased. Its shadow rushed past long before the ring itself had swept majestically overhead, still rising into space. He watched until it had dwindled to a thin thread of blue, hard for the eye to focus upon in the surrounding redness of the sky. When it vanished at last, it must already have been many thousands of kilometres across. And it was still growing.</div>

<div class="line_en">He looked back at the mountain. It was golden now, and devoid of all markings. Perhaps it was imagination -- he could believe anything by this time -- but it seemed taller and narrower, and appeared to be spinning like the funnel of a cyclone.

<div class="line_en">Vindarten moved swiftly into his line of vision. With implacable firmness, the great hands covered the lens turret and forced him to lower the camera. Jan did not attempt to resist: it would have been useless, of course, but he felt a sudden deathly fear of that thing out there at the edge of the world, and wanted no further part of it.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was of no importance now, for Earth was there ahead. He had seen it thus a hundred times before, but always through the remote, mechanical eye of the television camera. Now at last he himself was out here in space, as the final act of his dream unfolded itself; and Earth spun beneath on its eternal orbit. The great blue-green crescent was in its first quarter: more than half the visible disc was still in darkness. There was little cloud -- a few bands scattered along the line of the trade winds. The arctic cap glittered brilliantly, but was far outshone by the dazzling reflection of the sun in the north Pacific.</div>

<div class="line_en">Had he wished, Jan could doubtless have stayed here for the remainder of his life.
