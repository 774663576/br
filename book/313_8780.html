<div class="line_en">Our captive sat in the cabin opposite to the iron box which he had done so much and waited so long to gain. He was a sunburned reckless-eyed fellow, with a network of lines and wrinkles all over his mahogany features, which told of a hard, open-air life. There was a singular prominence about his bearded chin which marked a man who was not to be easily turned from his purpose. His age may have been fifty or there abouts, for his black, curly hair was thickly shot with gray. His face in repose was not an unpleasing one, though his heavy brows and aggressive chin gave him, as I had lately seen, a terrible expression when moved to anger. He sat now with his handcuffed hands upon his lap, and his head sunk upon his breast, while he looked with his keen, twinkling eyes at the box which had been the cause of his ill-doings. It seemed to me that there was more sorrow than anger in his rigid and contained countenance. Once he looked up at me with a gleam of something like humour in his eyes.</div>

<div class="line_en">"And so am I, sir," he answered frankly. "I don't believe that I can swing over the job. I give you my word on the book that I never raised hand against Mr. Sholto. It was that little hell-hound, Tonga, who shot one of his cursed darts into him. I had no part in it, sir. I was as grieved as if it had been my blood-relation. I welted the little devil with the slack end of the rope for it, but it was done, and I could not undo it again."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“先生，我也很遗憾，”他直率地答道，“我想我是难辞其咎了。可是，我向您发誓，我对肖尔托先生没有动过一个手指。是那个恶鬼汤加射出一支混账毒刺，害死了他。我完全不知情啊，先生。当时我伤心得好像死的是我的血亲一样。我用绳子鞭打了那小鬼一顿，可是，人死不能复生啊！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Have a cigar," said Holmes; "and you had best take a pull out of my flask, for you are very wet. How could you expect so small and weak a man as this black fellow to overpower Mr. Sholto and hold him while you were climbing the rope?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“先吸一支雪茄烟吧，”福尔摩斯说，“你全身都湿透了，最好喝一口我瓶子里的酒吧。你凭什么认为，在你爬绳子上去的时候，那个矮小、柔弱的黑小子能够打得过肖尔托先生，并控制住他呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You seem to know as much about it as if you were there, sir. The truth is that I hoped to find the room clear. I knew the habits of the house pretty well, and it was the time when Mr. Sholto usually went down to his supper. I shall make no secret of the business. The best defence that I can make is just the simple truth. Now, if it had been the old major I would have swung for him with a light heart. I would have thought no more of knifing him than of smoking this cigar. But it's cursed hard that I should be lagged over this young Sholto, with whom I had no quarrel whatever."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“先生，您知道得这么多，好像亲眼看见过似的。事实上，我本以为那屋里没有人。我对那所房子里的人的生活习惯都很清楚，那个时候正是肖尔托先生通常下楼吃晚饭的时间。我丝毫也不隐瞒。我认为，说实话就是我能做的最好的辩护。如果当时在那里的是老少校，那我就会毫不怜惜地勒死他。我杀了他和吸这支雪茄烟一样，不会有任何感觉。现在我竟因为小肖尔托被关进监狱，这实在令人痛心，因为我和他从来没有任何纠葛。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You are under the charge of Mr. Athelney Jones, of Scotland Yard. He is going to bring you up to my rooms, and I shall ask you for a true account of the matter. You must make a clean breast of it, for if you do I hope that I may be of use to you. I think I can prove that the poison acts so quickly that the man was dead before ever you reached the room."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你现在已经在伦敦警察厅阿塞尔纳·琼斯先生的羁押之下。他准备把你带到我的家中，先由我请你陈述事情经过。向我，你必须句句实言，如果你能够老实，或许我还可以帮你的忙。我想我有法子可以证明，那毒刺的毒性很快，在你爬进屋里以前，肖尔托先生已经中毒身亡了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That he was, sir. I never got such a turn in my life as when I saw him grinning at me with his head on his shoulder as I climbed through the window. It fairly shook me, sir. I'd have half killed Tonga for it if he had not scrambled off. That was how he came to leave his club, and some of his darts too, as he tells me, which I dare say helped to put you on our track; though how you kept on it is more than I can tell. I don't feel no malice against you for it. But it does seem a queer thing," he added with a bitter smile, "that I, who have a fair claim to half a million of money, should spend the first half of my life building a breakwater in the Andamans, and am like to spend the other half digging drains at Dartmoor. It was an evil day for me when first I clapped eyes upon the merchant Achmet and had to do with the Agra treasure, which never brought anything but a curse yet upon the man who owned it. To him it brought murder, to Major Sholto it brought fear and guilt, to me it has meant slavery for life."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不错，先生，他已经先死了。我这一辈子从没有那么惊讶过，当我爬进窗户时，就看见他歪着头，冲我狞笑。我着实吓坏了，先生。要不是汤加跑得快，当时我就把他打个半死了。后来他告诉我，这就是为什么他会失落了那根木棒和一些毒刺，我想这些东西一定有助于您追踪我们，至于您怎么把线索联系起来并捉到我的，我就不得而知了。我一点儿也不会因此而怨恨您。可是，这也真算一件怪事，”他又苦笑道，“我这个有正当权利拥有这五十万英镑的人，前半生竟在安达曼群岛修筑防堤，后半生恐怕又要到达特穆尔监狱去挖沟了。碰到那个商人阿基默德，并因此和阿格拉宝物沾上关系的那天，真是我的倒霉日子，这宝物只会给所有拥有它的人带来霉运而已。那个商人因宝物丧了命，肖尔托少校因宝物而恐惧、愧疚，而我则是终身做苦役。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Quite a family party," he remarked. "I think I shall have a pull at that flask, Holmes. Well, I think we may all congratulate each other. Pity we didn't take the other alive, but there was no choice. I say, Holmes, you must confess that you cut it rather fine. It was all we could do to overhaul her."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你们真像一家人在团聚啊。”他说，“福尔摩斯，请给我一些酒喝。咱们大家都该互相庆贺。可惜那一个没有被咱们活捉，但那也没有办法。我说，福尔摩斯，你必须承认，你干得妙极了。我们能做的就只是追上船而已。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"All is well that ends well," said Holmes. "But I certainly did not know that the Aurora was such a clipper."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“结果圆满就好，”福尔摩斯说，“可是我没想到，那只‘曙光’号竟然如此神速。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Smith says she is one of the fastest launches on the river, and that if he had had another man to help him with the engines we should never have caught her. He swears he knew nothing of this Norwood business."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“据史密斯说，‘曙光’号是泰晤士河上最快的汽船之一，假若当时还有一个人帮他掌发动机的话，我们就永远也追不上它了。他还赌咒说，他一点儿也不知道诺伍德的案件。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Neither he did," cried our prisoner --"not a word. I chose his launch because I heard that she was a flier. We told him nothing; but we paid him well, and he was to get something handsome if we reached our vessel, the Esmeralda at Gravesend, outward bound for the Brazil."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他的确不知情，”我们的囚犯喊道，“一个字都不知道。我选他的船，是因为听说他的船快。我们什么也没有告诉他，只是出了大价钱，如果我们能搭上在格雷夫森德停泊的开往巴西去的‘埃斯梅拉达’号轮船，他还可以另外得一大笔酬金。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At this moment Athelney Jones thrust his broad face and heavy shoulders into the tiny cabin.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, if he has done no wrong we shall see that no wrong comes to him. If we are pretty quick in catching our men, we are not so quick in condemning them." It was amusing to notice how the consequential Jones was already beginning to give himself airs on the strength of the capture. From the slight smile which played over Sherlock Holmes's face, I could see that the speech had not been lost upon him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“如果他没有犯罪，我们不会冤枉他的。我们虽然捉人迅速，可是，我们判刑是慎重的。”让人发笑的是，自高自大的琼斯已逐渐开始因为这次抓捕而洋洋自得了。从福尔摩斯脸上露出的微微一笑，我看得出来，琼斯的话没有逃过他的耳朵。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They landed me at Vauxhall, with my heavy iron box, and with a bluff, genial inspector as my companion. A quarter of an hour's drive brought us to Mrs. Cecil Forrester's. The servant seemed surprised at so late a visitor. Mrs. Cecil Forrester was out for the evening, she explained, and likely to be very late. Miss Morstan, however, was in the drawing-room; so to the drawing-room I went, box in hand, leaving the obliging inspector in the cab.</div>

<div class="line_en">She was seated by the open window, dressed in some sort of white diaphanous material, with a little touch of scarlet at the neck and waist. The soft light of a shaded lamp fell upon her as she leaned back in the basket chair, playing over her sweet grave face, and tinting with a dull, metallic sparkle the rich coils of her luxuriant hair. One white arm and hand drooped over the side of the chair, and her whole pose and figure spoke of an absorbing melancholy. At the sound of my footfall she sprang to her feet, however, and a bright flush of surprise and of pleasure coloured her pale cheeks.</div>
