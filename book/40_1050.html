Chapans, hats, tumbans, suits, ties -- you name it. Two stores here in Kabul, in Taimani and Shar-e-Nau, though I just sold those. And two in Pakistan, in Peshawar. That's where my warehouse is as well. So I travel a lot, back and forth. Which, these days"-- he shook his head and chuckled tiredly --"let's just say that it's an adventure.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Anyway, I was supposed to be back in Kabul the Wednesday before last. But, as luck would have it, I came down with an illness. I won't bother you with it, hamshira, suffice it to say that when I went to do my private business, the simpler of the two, it felt like passing chunks of broken glass. I wouldn't wish it on Hekmatyar himself. My wife, Nadia jan, Allah bless her, she begged me to see a doctor. But I thought I'd beat it with aspirin and a lot of water.

<div class="line_en">"What happened to him I heard from one of the nurses," Abdul Sharif resumed, tapping his chest with a fist as if to ease the passage of the pill. "With all the time I've spent in Peshawar, I've become pretty proficient in Urdu. Anyway, what I gathered was that your friend was in a lorry full of refugees, twenty-three of them, all headed for Peshawar. Near the border, they were caught in cross fire. A rocket hit the lorry. Probably a stray, but you never know with these people, you never know. There were only six survivors, all of them admitted to the same unit. Three died within twenty-four hours. Two of them lived -- sisters, as I understood it -- and had been discharged. Your friend Mr. Walizai was the last. He'd been there for almost three weeks by the time I arrived."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我从护士那儿听到他的遭遇，”阿卜杜拉·沙里夫继续说，他用一个拳头拍打着胸膛，好像是为了让药片通过食道。“我在白沙瓦住了很久，已经完全能听懂乌尔都语。反正我听到的情况是，你的朋友当时乘坐一辆载满难民的大货车，总共有二十三个人，他们都要去白沙瓦。接近边境的时候，他们碰到了枪战。一枚火箭弹击中了大货车。说不定那是偏离了靶子的火箭弹，但你永远无法了解那些人，你永远不知道他们是怎么想的。只有六个人活了下来，他们全都住进了同一家医院。有三个在二十四小时之内去世了。有两个还活着——听说是一对姐妹——出院了。你的朋友瓦里扎伊先生是最后一个。我去到那边的时候，他已经住院将近三个星期了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She swallowed dry spit. Shifted on her chair. She had to steel herself. If she didn't, she feared she would come unhinged. She diverted her thoughts from hospitals and special units and thought instead about the fact that she hadn't heard Tariq called by his full name since the two of them had enrolled in a Farsi winter course years back. The teacher would call roll after the bell and say his name like that -- Mohammad Tariq Walizai. It had struck her as comically officious then, hearing his full name uttered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她干咽了一口，在位子上挪动着身体。她必须让自己镇定下来。否则的话，她担心自己会情绪失控。她强迫自己不再去想着医院和特殊病房，却想起了这样一个事实：自从很多年前他们两个参加法尔西语冬季班以来，她还没听见有人用全名称呼塔里克。上课钟响之后，老师会点名，这样叫他的名字——穆罕默德·塔里克·瓦里扎伊。听到老师叫出他的全名，她觉得真是古板得很好笑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So he was alive. But how badly had they hurt him? Laila wondered frantically. How badly? Badly enough to be put in a special unit, evidently. Laila was aware that she had started sweating, that her face felt hot. She tried to think of something else, something pleasant, like the trip to Bamiyan to see the Buddhas with Tariq and Babi. But instead an image of Tariq's parents presented itself: Tariq's mother trapped in the lorry, upside down, screaming for Tariq through the smoke, her arms and chest on fire, the wig melting into her scalp…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这么说他还活着。但他们把他伤得多重呢？莱拉疯狂地想知道答案。伤得多重？显然重得需要让他住进一个特殊病房。莱拉意识到她开始浑身冒冷汗，面孔发烫。她试图想起别的事情，一些高兴的事情，比如和塔里克、爸爸一起去巴米扬看大佛的旅程。但塔里克父母的样子自行浮了上来：塔里克的母亲被卡在翻转的大货车之下，隔着烟雾凄厉地呼唤着塔里克，她的手臂和胸膛都着火了，假发在她的头顶熔化……">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Your friend, he was badly -- very badly -- injured, you understand. He had rubber tubes coming out of him everywhere. At first --" He cleared his throat. "At first, I thought he'd lost both legs in the attack, but a nurse said no, only the right, the left one was on account of an old injury. There were internal injuries too. They'd operated three times already. Took out sections of intestines, I don't remember what else. And he was burned. Quite badly. That's all I'll say about that. I'm sure you have your fair share of nightmares, hamshira. No sense in me adding to them."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你的朋友，你知道吗，他伤得非常——非常严重。他身上到处都插满了橡胶管。起初……”他清了清喉咙。“起初我以为他在那次爆炸中失去了双腿，但有个护士说不是的，只是失去了右腿，左腿是在先前一次受伤中失去的。他的内脏也受了伤。他们已经给他动了三次手术。取出一部分内脏，别的我就不知道了。他还被烧伤了。非常严重。他的病情我就说这么多。我相信这些已经足够让你夜里做噩梦了，小姐。我再说也没意义了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="现在塔里克两条小腿都没有了。他只有一个躯体，加上两条残余的大腿。没有腿。莱拉觉得她要崩溃了。她故意绝望地让她的思绪飘出这个房间，飘到窗外，离开这个男人，飘到外面的街道之上，飘到城市上空，飘过它那些屋顶平坦的房子和市场，飘过它那些迷宫似的、通向一片片沙漠的狭窄街道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I did most of the talking. It was hard for him to. His voice was hoarse, and I think it hurt him to move his lips. So I told him about my daughters, and about our house in Peshawar and the veranda my brother-in-law and I are building out in the back. I told him I had sold the stores in Kabul and that I was going back to finish up the paperwork. It wasn't much. But it occupied him. At least, I like to think it did.</div>
