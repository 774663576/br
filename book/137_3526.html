<div class="line_en">Claude Frollo was no longer the simple scholar of the college of Torch, the tender protector of a little child, the young and dreamy philosopher who knew many things and was ignorant of many. He was a priest, austere, grave, morose; one charged with souls; monsieur the archdeacon of Josas, the bishop's second acolyte, having charge of the two deaneries of Montlhéry, and Châteaufort, and one hundred and seventy-four country curacies. He was an imposing and sombre personage, before whom the choir boys in alb and in jacket trembled, as well as the machicots, and the brothers of Saint-Augustine and the matutinal clerks of Notre-Dame, when he passed slowly beneath the lofty arches of the choir, majestic, thoughtful, with arms folded and his head so bent upon his breast that all one saw of his face was his large, bald brow.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dom Claude Frollo had, however, abandoned neither science nor the education of his young brother, those two occupations of his life. But as time went on, some bitterness had been mingled with these things which were so sweet. In the long run, says Paul Diacre, the best lard turns rancid. Little Jehan Frollo, surnamed (du Moulin) "of the Mill" because of the place where he had been reared, had not grown up in the direction which Claude would have liked to impose upon him. The big brother counted upon a pious, docile, learned, and honorable pupil. But the little brother, like those young trees which deceive the gardener's hopes and turn obstinately to the quarter whence they receive sun and air, the little brother did not grow and did not multiply, but only put forth fine bushy and luxuriant branches on the side of laziness, ignorance, and debauchery. He was a regular devil, and a very disorderly one, who made Dom Claude scowl; but very droll and very subtle, which made the big brother smile.</div>

<div class="line_en">Claude had confided him to that same college of Torchi where he had passed his early years in study and meditation; and it was a grief to him that this sanctuary, formerly edified by the name of Frollo, should to-day be scandalized by it. He sometimes preached Jehan very long and severe sermons, which the latter intrepidly endured. After all, the young scapegrace had a good heart, as can be seen in all comedies. But the sermon over, he none the less tranquilly resumed his course of seditions and enormities. Now it was a bejaune or yellow beak (as they called the new arrivals at the university), whom he had been mauling by way of welcome; a precious tradition which has been carefully preserved to our own day. Again, he had set in movement a band of scholars, who had flung themselves upon a wine-shop in classic fashion, quasi classico excitati, had then beaten the tavern-keeper "with offensive cudgels," and joyously pillaged the tavern, even to smashing in the hogsheads of wine in the cellar. And then it was a fine report in Latin, which the sub-monitor of Torchi carried piteously to Dom Claude with this dolorous marginal comment, -- Rixa; prima causa vinum optimum potatum. Finally, it was said, a thing quite horrible in a boy of sixteen, that his debauchery often extended as far as the Rue de Glatigny.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克洛德把他也交托给自己度过最初几年学习与沉思生活的托尔希学校。这座曾因弗罗洛这个姓氏而显赫一时的神圣庙堂，今天却由这个姓氏而受到玷辱，克洛德感到极为痛苦。有时，他为此对小约翰十分严厉地大加训斥，弟弟都以大无畏的精神承受了。毕竟，这小混蛋心地善良，——这在一切喜剧中可不是屡见不鲜的吗？但是，训斥刚过，他又故态复萌，照旧心安理得，叛逆如故，荒诞不经。有时，他为了表示欢迎，对哪个“雏儿”（当时对新入学的大学生的称呼就是如此）欺负一番——这个宝贵传统一直小心翼翼地保存至我们今天。有时，他把一帮子按照传统冲入小酒店的学生鼓动起来，quasi classico excitati（40），“用进攻性棍子”把酒店老板揍上一顿，欢天喜地把酒店吃个精光，连酒窖里的酒桶也给喝个涓滴不剩。于是，托尔希的副学监不胜悲伤地给堂克洛德用拉丁文打了个出色的报告，痛苦的边注是Rixa；prima causa vinum optimum potatum（41）。还有，据说，他的种种荒唐行径甚至一再搞到格拉提尼街上去了（42），这对一个十六岁的少年来说是相当可怕的。【注：（40）拉丁文，差不多把全班鼓动起来。（41）拉丁文，一场斗殴；而这是纵饮的直接结果。（42）这是指他甚至去赌场和其他下流场所聚集之地。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As Claude Frollo had passed through nearly the entire circle of human learning -- positive, exterior, and permissible -- since his youth, he was obliged, unless he came to a halt, ubi defuit orbis, to proceed further and seek other aliments for the insatiable activity of his intelligence. The antique symbol of the serpent biting its tail is, above all, applicable to science. It would appear that Claude Frollo had experienced this. Many grave persons affirm that, after having exhausted the fas of human learning, he had dared to penetrate into the nefas. He had, they said, tasted in succession all the apples of the tree of knowledge, and, whether from hunger or disgust, had ended by tasting the forbidden fruit. He had taken his place by turns, as the reader has seen, in the conferences of the theologians in Sorbonne, -- in the assemblies of the doctors of art, after the manner of Saint-Hilaire, -- in the disputes of the decretalists, after the manner of Saint-Martin, -- in the congregations of physicians at the holy water font of Notre-Dame, ad cupam Nostroe-Dominoe. All the dishes permitted and approved, which those four great kitchens called the four faculties could elaborate and serve to the understanding, he had devoured, and had been satiated with them before his hunger was appeased. Then he had penetrated further, lower, beneath all that finished, material, limited knowledge; he had, perhaps, risked his soul, and had seated himself in the cavern at that mysterious table of the alchemists, of the astrologers, of the hermetics, of which Averroès, Gillaume de Paris, and Nicolas Flamel hold the end in the Middle Ages; and which extends in the East, by the light of the seven-branched candlestick, to Solomon, Pythagoras, and Zoroaster.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克洛德·弗罗洛早在年轻时，就涉猎了实证的、外在的、合乎规矩的人类知识的几乎一切领域，因此，除非他自己认为ubi defuit orbis（43）而停止下来，他就不得不继续前进，寻求其他食料以餍足他的智能永无满足的活动所需。自啮尾巴的蛇，这个古代象征，用于做学问尤其适合。看来，克洛德·弗罗洛对此有切身的体验。好些庄重的人肯定说：克洛德在穷尽了人类知识的fas之后，已经鼓起勇气向nefas（44）领域奋进。据说，他已经把智慧树的苹果（45）一一尝遍，也许是由于饥饿，也许是由于腻味，他终于咬起禁果（46）来了。我们的读者大概已经看见，举凡索尔朋神学家的讲座，效法圣伊拉里的文学士集会，效法圣马丁的教会法学家的辩论，医学家在圣母院圣水盘前（ad cupam Nostræ Dominæ）的聚会，他都一一参加了。那四大厨师——即，被称为四大智能的——所能烹调、所能提供给智慧、一切可以允许的、被批准的菜肴，他都已经吞尽，还没有吃饱就已经餍足了；于是，他更深、更低地去挖掘，一直深入到那种有限的、物质的、狭隘的知识下面；他甚至以自己的灵魂孤注一掷，探入洞穴，坐在炼金术士、星象家、方士们的神秘桌前：这张桌子的一端，在中世纪坐着阿维罗埃斯（47）、巴黎的吉约墨、尼古拉·弗拉麦，这张桌子在七枝烛台的照耀下，在东方一直延展到所罗门、毕塔哥拉斯和佐罗阿斯特（48）。【注：（43）拉丁文，几近极限。（44）拉丁文，fas，“善”；nefas，“恶”。（45）智慧之果，典出亚当和夏娃的故事。（46）禁果，肉欲之果。（47）阿维罗埃斯（1126—1198），著名的阿拉伯哲学家、医学家，被认为是东方巫术之祖。（48）佐罗阿斯特（琐罗亚斯德，又译苏鲁支）（约公元前七至六世纪），“祆教”的创始人。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Claude, saddened and discouraged in his human affections, by all this, had flung himself eagerly into the arms of learning, that sister which, at least does not laugh in your face, and which always pays you, though in money that is sometimes a little hollow, for the attention which you have paid to her. Hence, he became more and more learned, and, at the same time, as a natural consequence, more and more rigid as a priest, more and more sad as a man. There are for each of us several parallelisms between our intelligence, our habits, and our character, which develop without a break, and break only in the great disturbances of life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="由于这一切，克洛德伤心之至，仁爱之心大受挫伤，就更加狂热地投身于知识的怀抱——这位大姐至少不会嘲笑我们，我们对她殷勤，她总是给予报偿的，虽然所付货币有时不怎么贵重。这样，他就越来越博学多识，同时，由于自然逻辑的力量，作为教士也就越来越苛刻，作为人也就越来越忧伤了。拿我们每一个人来说，智力、道德和性格总有彼此相似的地方，总是持续不断地发展的，只有生活中的重大变故才会把它打断。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It is certain that he had frequently been seen to pass along the Rue des Lombards, and furtively enter a little house which formed the corner of the Rue des Ecrivans and the Rue Marivault. It was the house which Nicolas Flamel had built, where he had died about 1417, and which, constantly deserted since that time, had already begun to fall in ruins, -- so greatly had the hermetics and the alchemists of all countries wasted away the walls, merely by carving their names upon them. Some neighbors even affirm that they had once seen, through an air-hole, Archdeacon Claude excavating, turning over, digging up the earth in the two cellars, whose supports had been daubed with numberless couplets and hieroglyphics by Nicolas Flamel himself. It was supposed that Flamel had buried the philosopher's stone in the cellar; and the alchemists, for the space of two centuries, from Magistri to Father Pacifique, never ceased to worry the soil until the house, so cruelly ransacked and turned over, ended by falling into dust beneath their feet.</div>

<div class="line_en">It is certain that the archdeacon often visited the cemetery of the Saints-Innocents, where, it is true, his father and mother had been buried, with other victims of the plague of 1466; but that he appeared far less devout before the cross of their grave than before the strange figures with which the tomb of Nicolas Flamel and Claude Pernelle, erected just beside it, was loaded.</div>

<div class="line_en">Again, it is certain that the archdeacon had been seized with a singular passion for the symbolical door of Notre-Dame, that page of a conjuring book written in stone, by Bishop Guillaume de Paris, who has, no doubt, been damned for having affixed so infernal a frontispiece to the sacred poem chanted by the rest of the edifice. Archdeacon Claude had the credit also of having fathomed the mystery of the colossus of Saint Christopher, and of that lofty, enigmatical statue which then stood at the entrance of the vestibule, and which the people, in derision, called "Monsieur Legris." But, what every one might have noticed was the interminable hours which he often employed, seated upon the parapet of the area in front of the church, in contemplating the sculptures of the front; examining now the foolish virgins with their lamps reversed, now the wise virgins with their lamps upright; again, calculating the angle of vision of that raven which belongs to the left front, and which is looking at a mysterious point inside the church, where is concealed the philosopher's stone, if it be not in the cellar of Nicolas Flamel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="确实，副主教满怀奇特的热情爱着圣母院那富于象征意义的拱门。这是巴黎的吉约墨主教用石头刻写的魔法书的一页。这座建筑物的其余部分永恒地咏唱着神圣诗章，他却加上这样恶魔般的扉页，因而他一定已经下了地狱。据说，克洛德还深入探究了圣克里斯多夫巨像的奥秘。当时这座谜也似的长长的石像矗立在圣母院前庭（49）的入口，民众戏称它为“灰先生”。但是，也许大家都已经发现，克洛德常常坐在广场栏杆上，一坐就是好几个小时，不断静观门廊上的塑像：有时观察那些倒擎灯盏的轻佻处女，有时观察直举灯盏的圣洁处女；再不然，就计算左边门道上那只乌鸦的视角，因为它站在那里向教堂里面某一个点凝视，尼古拉·弗拉麦的点金石假如不在地窖里面，一定就在它所张望的那个地方埋藏着。【注：（49）巴黎圣母院前面的广场，至今仍叫“前庭”，当然，如前面的一个注所说的，房屋均已拆除，前庭比中世纪、也比雨果的时代，大得多了。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was, let us remark in passing, a singular fate for the Church of Notre-Dame at that epoch to be so beloved, in two different degrees, and with so much devotion, by two beings so dissimilar as Claude and Quasimodo. Beloved by one, a sort of instinctive and savage half-man, for its beauty, for its stature, for the harmonies which emanated from its magnificent ensemble; beloved by the other, a learned and passionate imagination, for its myth, for the sense which it contains, for the symbolism scattered beneath the sculptures of its front, -- like the first text underneath the second in a palimpsest, -- in a word, for the enigma which it is eternally propounding to the understanding.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="顺带指出，当时这座主教堂的命运真是奇怪，因为两个截然不同的人都那样虔诚地热爱它，方式却不一样：卡席莫多是一种半人半兽的生物，一切凭借本能，爱它的壮丽、宏伟与和谐，而这些都发自它那样雄浑的整体；克洛德是一个博学多识、想象力炽热的人，爱它的寓意、神秘、内里的含义、门面上各种雕塑下面暗藏着的象征，仿佛那是羊皮书中第二次文字下面隐藏着第一次书写的文字，总之，爱它向人类智慧永恒地提出的谜。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Furthermore, it is certain that the archdeacon had established himself in that one of the two towers which looks upon the Grève, just beside the frame for the bells, a very secret little cell, into which no one, not even the bishop, entered without his leave, it was said. This tiny cell had formerly been made almost at the summit of the tower, among the ravens' nests, by Bishop Hugo de Besançon who had wrought sorcery there in his day. What that cell contained, no one knew; but from the strand of the Terrain, at night, there was often seen to appear, disappear, and reappear at brief and regular intervals, at a little dormer window opening upon the back of the tower, a certain red, intermittent, singular light which seemed to follow the panting breaths of a bellows, and to proceed from a flame, rather than from a light. In the darkness, at that height, it produced a singular effect; and the goodwives said: "There's the archdeacon blowing! hell is sparkling up yonder!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="确实，副主教在两座钟楼中那座俯视河滩广场的钟楼里，就在放钟的木笼旁边，安置了一间十分隐秘的幽室，谁也不能进去，据说，不经他的允许，即使主教也不能进去。几乎就在钟楼顶端、乌鸦窝中间的这间小室，以前是贝桑松的雨果主教（50）开辟的，那时他在里面施行蛊术。这小室里面藏着什么，谁也不知道；但是，夜里，从广场滩地上时常可以看见：钟楼背后的一个小窗洞里透出红色灯光，时断时续，以短暂而均匀的间隔时隐时现，十分古怪。这灯光似乎是跟随着某种呼吸的粗重起伏。与其说是灯光，不如说是火焰。在黑暗中，在那样高的地方，给人的印象是怪异的，所以，附近的老太太们都说：“瞧呀，副主教在呼吸哩！那上面是地狱的火花在闪耀。”【注：（50）雨果二世·德·贝桑松（1326—1382）。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There were no great proofs of sorcery in that, after all, but there was still enough smoke to warrant a surmise of fire, and the archdeacon bore a tolerably formidable reputation. We ought to mention however, that the sciences of Egypt, that necromancy and magic, even the whitest, even the most innocent, had no more envenomed enemy, no more pitiless denunciator before the gentlemen of the officialty of Notre-Dame. Whether this was sincere horror, or the game played by the thief who shouts, "stop thief!" at all events, it did not prevent the archdeacon from being considered by the learned heads of the chapter, as a soul who had ventured into the vestibule of hell, who was lost in the caves of the cabal, groping amid the shadows of the occult sciences. Neither were the people deceived thereby; with any one who possessed any sagacity, Quasimodo passed for the demon; Claude Frollo, for the sorcerer. It was evident that the bellringer was to serve the archdeacon for a given time, at the end of which he would carry away the latter's soul, by way of payment. Thus the archdeacon, in spite of the excessive austerity of his life, was in bad odor among all pious souls; and there was no devout nose so inexperienced that it could not smell him out to be a magician.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，这一切毕竟算不上什么重大的证据，证明其中有巫术。可是，烟到底太多了，难怪人们猜测这里面有火（51），因此，副主教恶名昭著。其实，我们应该说，埃及邪术、鬼魂附身术、魔法之类，即使其中最清白无辜的，在提交圣母院主教法庭审判的时候，再也没有比副主教更为凶恶的敌人、更遭人痛恨的了。他是真诚感到恐怖也罢，是贼喊捉贼也罢，反正，主教堂众教士以其充满学问的脑瓜子认定了副主教是个灵魂敢入地狱门廊，在神秘教魔窟中迷途，在旁门左道的黑暗中摸索的人。民众对此也是不会误会的，凡是稍有心智的人都认为，卡席莫多是魔鬼，克洛德·弗罗洛是巫师。显然，敲钟人不过是预定为副主教效劳一段时间，期限一完就要把他的灵魂抓去作为报酬。因此，尽管副主教生活极为刻苦，在一切虔诚者看来却是臭名昭著的，没有一个笃信宗教的人，即使毫无嗅觉经验，闻不出他是一个魔法师。【注：（51）一语双关，既指克洛德巫术冒烟喷火，也套用谚语“无烟不起火”（犹言“无风不起浪”）。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">However, he redoubled his severity, and had never been more exemplary. By profession as well as by character, he had always held himself aloof from women; he seemed to hate them more than ever. The mere rustling of a silken petticoat caused his hood to fall over his eyes. Upon this score he was so jealous of austerity and reserve, that when the Dame de Beaujeu, the king's daughter, came to visit the cloister of Notre-Dame, in the month of December, 1481, he gravely opposed her entrance, reminding the bishop of the statute of the Black Book, dating from the vigil of Saint-Barthélemy, 1334, which interdicts access to the cloister to "any woman whatever, old or young, mistress or maid." Upon which the bishop had been constrained to recite to him the ordinance of Legate Odo, which excepts certain great dames, aliquoe magnates mulieres, quoe sine scandalo vitari non possunt. And again the archdeacon had protested, objecting that the ordinance of the legate, which dated back to 1207, was anterior by a hundred and twenty-seven years to the Black Book, and consequently was abrogated in fact by it. And he had refused to appear before the princess.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，他更加道貌岸然，也比以往更加堪为表率了。由于身份，也由于性格，他一向不近女色，现在他似乎更加憎恨女人了。只要听见女人绸衫窸窸窣窣的声音，他立刻就把风帽拉下遮住眼睛。在这方面，他竭尽苛刻保守之能事，于是，一四八一年十二月，当王女博惹公主前来拜谒圣母院的时候，他郑重其事地反对她进入，向主教提出一三三四年圣巴特勒米日（53）前夕颁布的黑皮书中的规定：任何妇人，“无论老幼、贵贱”，一律不许进入修院。对此，主教只好引述教皇使节奥当的命令：某些贵妇人不在此例，aliquœ magnates mulieres，quœ sine scandalo vitari non possunt。（54）可是，副主教仍然不表同意，反对说，教皇使节的该项命令颁布的时间是一二〇七年，就是说，比黑皮书早一百二十七年，因此事实上已被后者废除。于是，他拒绝在公主面前出现。【注：（53）圣巴特勒米日为8月24日。（54）拉丁文，对某些贵妇，除非确有丑行，不得拒绝。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was also noticed that his horror for Bohemian women and gypsies had seemed to redouble for some time past. He had petitioned the bishop for an edict which expressly forbade the Bohemian women to come and dance and beat their tambourines on the place of the Parvis; and for about the same length of time, he had been ransacking the mouldy placards of the officialty, in order to collect the cases of sorcerers and witches condemned to fire or the rope, for complicity in crimes with rams, sows, or goats.</div>
