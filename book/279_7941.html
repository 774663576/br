<div class="line_en">"Well, I don't say it wasn't a fine joke, Tom, to keep everybody suffering 'most a week so you boys had a good time, but it is a pity you could be so hard–hearted as to let me suffer so. If you could come over on a log to go to your funeral, you could have come over and give me a hint some way that you warn't dead, but only run off."</div>

<div class="line_en">That was Tom's great secret-the scheme to return home with his brother pirates and attend their own funerals. They had paddled over to the Missouri shore on a log, at dusk on Saturday, landing five or six miles below the village; they had slept in the woods at the edge of the town till nearly daylight, and had then crept through back lanes and alleys and finished their sleep in the gallery of the church among a chaos of invalided benches.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这就是汤姆最大的秘密计划——和他的海盗帮兄弟们一同回家，出席自己的葬礼。星期六黄昏的时候，他们坐在一块大木头上，顺流而漂，漂到密苏里河的另一边，在离小镇下游五六英里的地方上了岸。他们在镇外的树林子里睡了一觉，醒来时，天已快亮。然后他们悄悄地穿过僻静的胡同和小巷，溜进教堂的长廊。那儿堆满了乱七八糟的破凳子。他们又接着睡，一觉睡到了大天亮。">查看中文翻译</div>

And indeed it was; he tried not to seem to see the looks or hear the remarks as he passed along, but they were food and drink to him. Smaller boys than himself flocked at his heels, as proud to be seen with him, and tolerated by him, as if he had been the drummer at the head of a procession or the elephant leading a menagerie into town. Boys of his own size pretended not to know he had been away at all; but they were consuming with envy, nevertheless. They would have given anything to have that swarthy suntanned skin of his, and his glittering notoriety; and Tom would not have parted with either for a circus.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tom decided that he could be independent of Becky Thatcher now. Glory was sufficient. He would live for glory. Now that he was distinguished, maybe she would be wanting to "make up." Well, let her-she should see that he could be as indifferent as some other people. Presently she arrived. Tom pretended not to see her. He moved away and joined a group of boys and girls and began to talk. Soon he observed that she was tripping gayly back and forth with flushed face and dancing eyes, pretending to be busy chasing schoolmates, and screaming with laughter when she made a capture; but he noticed that she always made her captures in his vicinity, and that she seemed to cast a conscious eye in his direction at such times, too. It gratified all the vicious vanity that was in him; and so, instead of winning him, it only "set him up" the more and made him the more diligent to avoid betraying that he knew she was about. Presently she gave over skylarking, and moved irresolutely about, sighing once or twice and glancing furtively and wistfully toward Tom. Then she observed that now Tom was talking more particularly to Amy Lawrence than to any one else. She felt a sharp pang and grew disturbed and uneasy at once. She tried to go away, but her feet were treacherous, and carried her to the group instead. She said to a girl almost at Tom's elbow-with sham vivacity:</div>

<div class="line_en">At recess Tom continued his flirtation with Amy with jubilant self–satisfaction. And he kept drifting about to find Becky and lacerate her with the performance. At last he spied her, but there was a sudden falling of his mercury. She was sitting cosily on a little bench behind the schoolhouse looking at a picture–book with Alfred Temple-and so absorbed were they, and their heads so close together over the book, that they did not seem to be conscious of anything in the world besides. Jealousy ran red–hot through Tom's veins. He began to hate himself for throwing away the chance Becky had offered for a reconciliation. He called himself a fool, and all the hard names he could think of. He wanted to cry with vexation. Amy chatted happily along, as they walked, for her heart was singing, but Tom's tongue had lost its function. He did not hear what Amy was saying, and whenever she paused expectantly he could only stammer an awkward assent, which was as often misplaced as otherwise. He kept drifting to the rear of the schoolhouse, again and again, to sear his eyeballs with the hateful spectacle there. He could not help it. And it maddened him to see, as he thought he saw, that Becky Thatcher never once suspected that he was even in the land of the living. But she did see, nevertheless; and she knew she was winning her fight, too, and was glad to see him suffer as she had suffered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="课间休息的时候，汤姆继续和艾美逗乐，一副得意洋洋、心满意足的样子。他走来窜去想让贝基看见，以此来激怒她，伤她的心。最后，他终于在教室后面找到她。可他却像泄了气的皮球似的，情绪一落千丈。原来，贝基正舒舒服服地坐在一条小板凳上和阿尔费雷德·邓波儿一起在看画书。他们看得聚精会神，头也凑得很近，仿佛世上只有他俩存在。嫉妒的火焰在汤姆身上燃烧起来。他开始憎恨自己，骂自己是个傻瓜，白白放弃了贝基给他言归于好的机会。凡是能骂自己的话，他都派上了用场。他又急又气，直想放声大哭一场。而艾美此时却很开心，边走边快快活活地聊着。汤姆一句也听不进去，只是默默无语地往前走。艾美有时停下来，等他答话，他很尴尬，答得总是前言不对后语，不管问他什么，回答都是是的，是的。他忍不住一次又一次地走到教室后面，看见那可恨的一幕，气得他眼球都要掉了出来。更让他发疯的是贝基·撒切尔根本就没有把他放在眼里，不知道世上还有他这个大活宝（他是这么想的）。实际上贝基已发现他来了，她知道这次较量中自己赢了，见现在轮到汤姆受罪，她十分高兴。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And so on, with clapping of joyful hands till all the group had begged for invitations but Tom and Amy. Then Tom turned coolly away, still talking, and took Amy with him. Becky's lips trembled and the tears came to her eyes; she hid these signs with a forced gayety and went on chattering, but the life had gone out of the picnic, now, and out of everything else; she got away as soon as she could and hid herself and had what her sex call "a good cry." Then she sat moody, with wounded pride, till the bell rang. She roused up, now, with a vindictive cast in her eye, and gave her plaited tails a shake and said she knew what SHE'D do.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就这样，除汤姆和艾美以外，所有的孩子都高兴地拍着手，要求贝基请他们参加野餐。汤姆冷冰冰地转身带着艾美走了，边走边和她谈着。见到这情景，贝基气得嘴唇发抖，泪往上涌。她强装笑脸，不让别人看出有什么异样来，继续聊着。可是野餐的事现在失去了意义，一切都黯然失色。她马上跑开，找了一个无人的地方，照她们的说法“痛哭了一场”。由于自尊心受到了伤害，她闷闷不乐地坐在那里，一直坐到上课铃响，这时，她站起身来，瞪大眼睛，一副复仇的样子，把辫子往后一甩说：有他好看的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Any other boy!" Tom thought, grating his teeth. "Any boy in the whole town but that Saint Louis smarty that thinks he dresses so fine and is aristocracy!

<div class="line_en">Tom fled home at noon. His conscience could not endure any more of Amy's grateful happiness, and his jealousy could bear no more of the other distress. Becky resumed her picture inspections with Alfred, but as the minutes dragged along and no Tom came to suffer, her triumph began to cloud and she lost interest; gravity and absent–mindedness followed, and then melancholy; two or three times she pricked up her ear at a footstep, but it was a false hope; no Tom came. At last she grew entirely miserable and wished she hadn't carried it so far. When poor Alfred, seeing that he was losing her, he did not know how, kept exclaiming: "Oh, here's a jolly one! look at this!" she lost patience at last, and said, "Oh, don't bother me! I don't care for them!" and burst into tears, and got up and walked away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="中午时分，汤姆溜回家。有两件事让他很头疼：一是艾美的欢乐，他受不了她的纠缠；二是教室后面的那一幕，嫉妒让他再也不能经受别的打击了。贝基继续和阿尔费雷德看画书，时间一分一秒地过去，她想看汤姆的笑话，可汤姆却没有来，她那得意的心里不免蒙上一层阴影，于是她不再沾沾自喜了，继之而来的是心情沉重。她不能集中思想，到后来又变得心情忧郁。可是希望总是落空，汤姆并没有来。最后她伤心极了，后悔自己把事情做过了头。那个可怜的阿尔弗雷德见她心不在焉就不停地大声说道：“喂，你看这一张真有趣！”这回，她终于耐不住性子了，说：“哼，别烦我了！我不喜欢这些东西！”说完，她突然大哭起来，站起身扭头就走。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Amy's happy prattle became intolerable. Tom hinted at things he had to attend to; things that must be done; and time was fleeting. But in vain-the girl chirped on. Tom thought, "Oh, hang her, ain't I ever going to get rid of her?" At last he must be attending to those things-and she said artlessly that she would be "around" when school let out. And he hastened away, hating her for it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="艾美兴高采烈地叽叽喳喳说个不停，汤姆感到无法忍受。他暗示自己有事要办，而且时间不等人，必须马上就去做；可那个姑娘根本没明白过来，还是照讲不停。汤姆想：“哎，该死的，怎么老是缠着我不放。”到后来他非走不可了，可她仍是糊里糊涂，还说什么她会来“等他”。于是汤姆只得匆匆地悻悻离去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And he went through the motions of thrashing an imaginary boy -- pummelling the air, and kicking and gouging. "Oh, you do, do you? You holler 'nough, do you? Now, then, let that learn you!" And so the imaginary flogging was finished to his satisfaction.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是他拳打脚踢，平空乱舞一通，仿佛正在打那个孩子，挖他的眼睛。“我揍你，我揍你，不叫求饶！我要让你记住这个教训。”这场想象的打斗以对方失败而告终，汤姆感到心满意足。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So the boy halted, wondering what he could have done-for she had said she would look at pictures all through the nooning-and she walked on, crying. Then Alfred went musing into the deserted schoolhouse. He was humiliated and angry. He easily guessed his way to the truth-the girl had simply made a convenience of him to vent her spite upon Tom Sawyer. He was far from hating Tom the less when this thought occurred to him. He wished there was some way to get that boy into trouble without much risk to himself. Tom's spelling–book fell under his eye. Here was his opportunity. He gratefully opened to the lesson for the afternoon and poured ink upon the page.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是这孩子便止住了脚步，纳闷自己是不是做错了什么——因为事先说好了整个中午休息时，她都要和他一块儿看画书的——可是现在她却哭着走了。他苦思冥想来到了空荡荡的教室，感到受了羞辱，非常恼火。很快，他琢磨出了事情的缘由；原来他成了这个女孩子对汤姆·索亚发泄私愤的工具。想到这一点，他越发痛恨汤姆。他希望能找个办法既能让这家伙吃苦头又不连累自己。这时，汤姆的拼音课本跃入他的眼帘。报复的机会来了，他乐滋滋地把书翻到当天下午要学的那一课，然后把墨水泼在了上面。">查看中文翻译</div>
