<div class="line_en">The river was a blue-green ribbon shining in the morning sun. Reeds grew thick in the shallows along the banks, and Arya saw a water snake skimming across the surface, ripples spreading out behind it as it went. Overhead a hawk flew in lazy circles.</div>

<div class="line_en">When Yoren saw the corpse, he spat. "Dobber, see if he's got anything worth the taking. Mail, knife, a bit o' coin, what have you." He spurred his gelding and rode out into the river, but the horse struggled in the soft mud and beyond the reeds the water deepened. Yoren rode back angry, his horse covered in brown slime up to the knees. "We won't be crossing here. Koss, you'll come with me upriver, look for a ford. Woth, Gerren, you go downstream. The rest o' you wait here. Put a guard out."</div>

<div class="line_en">It seemed a peaceful place… until Koss spotted the dead man. "There, in the reeds." He pointed, and Arya saw it. The body of a soldier, shapeless and swollen. His sodden green cloak had hung up on a rotted log, and a school of tiny silver fishes were nibbling at his face. "I told you there was bodies," Lommy announced. "I could taste them in that water."</div>

<div class="line_en">Dobber found a leather purse in the dead man's belt. Inside were four coppers and a little hank of blond hair tied up with a red ribbon. Lommy and Tarber stripped naked and went wading, and Lommy scooped up handfuls of slimy mud and threw them at Hot Pie, shouting, "Mud Pie! Mud Pie!" In the back of their wagon, Rorge cursed and threatened and told them to unchain him while Yoren was gone, but no one paid him any mind. Kurz caught a fish with his bare hands. Arya saw how he did it, standing over a shallow pool, calm as still water, his hand darting out quick as a snake when the fish swam near. It didn't look as hard as catching cats. Fish didn't have claws.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was midday when the others returned. Woth reported a wooden bridge half a mile downstream, but someone had burned it up. Yoren peeled a sourleaf off the bale. "Might be we could swim the horses over, maybe the donkeys, but there's no way we'll get those wagons across. And there's smoke to the north and west, more fires, could be this side o' the river's the place we want to be." He picked up a long stick and drew a circle in the mud, a line trailing down from it. "That's Gods Eye, with the river flowing south. We're here." He poked a hole beside the line of the river, under the circle. "We can't go round west of the lake, like I thought. East takes us back to the kingsroad." He moved the stick up to where the line and circle met. "Near as I recall, there's a town here. The holdfast's stone, and there's a lordling got his seat there too, just a towerhouse, but he'll have a guard, might be a knight or two. We follow the river north, should be there before dark. They'll have boats, so I mean to sell all we got and hire us one." He drew the stick up through the circle of the lake, from bottom to top. "Gods be good, we'll find a wind and sail across the Gods Eye to Harrentown." He thrust the point down at the top of the circle. "We can buy new mounts there, or else take shelter at Harrenhal. That's Lady Whent's seat, and she's always been a friend o' the Watch."</div>

<div class="line_en">The river track was no kingsroad, yet it was not half bad for what it was, and for once the wagons rolled along smartly. They saw the first house an hour shy of evenfall, a snug little thatch-roofed cottage surrounded by fields of wheat. Yoren rode out ahead, hallooing, but got no answer. "Dead, might be. Or hiding. Dobber, Rey, with me." The three men went into the cottage. "Pots is gone, no sign o' any coin laid by," Yoren muttered when they returned. "No animals. Run, most like. Might be we met 'em on the kingsroad." At least the house and field had not been burned, and there were no corpses about. Tarber found a garden out back, and they pulled some onions and radishes and filled a sack with cabbages before they went on their way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="河边小径无法和国王大道相比，不过倒也可以接受，因为马车总算是走得顺当了。日落前一小时，他们见到了第一座房舍。那是一间舒适的小茅屋，四周是麦田。尤伦趋前招呼，但无人回应。“可能是死了，不然就躲了起来。道柏、雷，跟我来。”三人进茅屋搜索。“锅盆都不见了，没看到钱。”他们回来时，尤伦喃喃道，“牲口也一只不剩，我看八成是跑啦，搞不好还跟咱们在国王大道上照过面。”还好，最起码这里的房屋和田地没被烧掉，附近也没有死尸。塔柏在屋后找到一座花园，人们拔了几颗洋葱和萝卜，又装了一袋甘蓝菜，方才继续上路。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Arya was remembering the stories Old Nan used to tell of Harrenhal. Evil King Harren had walled himself up inside, so Aegon unleashed his dragons and turned the castle into a pyre. Nan said that fiery spirits still haunted the blackened towers. Sometimes men went to sleep safe in their beds and were found dead in the morning, all burnt up. Arya didn't really believe that, and anyhow it had all happened a long time ago. Hot Pie was being silly; it wouldn't be ghosts at Harrenhal, it would be knights. Arya could reveal herself to Lady Whent, and the knights would escort her home and keep her safe. That was what knights did; they kept you safe, especially women. Maybe Lady Whent would even help the crying girl.</div>

<div class="line_en">A little farther up the road, they glimpsed a forester's cabin surrounded by old trees and neatly stacked logs ready for the splitting, and later a ramshackle stilt-house leaning over the river on poles ten feet tall, both deserted. They passed more fields, wheat and corn and barley ripening in the sun, but here there were no men sitting in trees, nor walking the rows with scythes. Finally the town came into view; a cluster of white houses spread out around the walls of the holdfast, a big sept with a shingled wooden roof, the lord's towerhouse sitting on a small rise to the west… and no sign of any people, anywhere.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="再走一小段，他们先是瞥见一栋老树环绕的林务官小屋，屋外堆着整齐待劈的柴木，之后又看到河面上以十尺长竿筑成的破烂高屋，两者都空荡荡的。片片农地被他们越过，阳光照耀，田里的大麦、小麦和玉米结实累累，但既无人在树下纳凉休息，也无人拿着镰刀往来收割。最后，小镇映入眼帘：一间间白色房舍散布在庄园墙外四周，还有一间木瓦屋顶的大圣堂，领主的塔楼座落在西边的小丘…但全镇空无一人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The black brother left ten to guard the wagons and the whimpery little girl, and split the rest of them into four groups of five to search the town.

<div class="line_en">The sun was low to the west, and the houses cast long dark shadows. A sudden clap of sound made Arya reach for Needle, but it was only a shutter banging in the wind. After the open river shore, the closeness of the town unnerved her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="让人觉得自己是胆小鬼夕阳西垂，房屋洒下长长的黑影。突然啪啦一声，吓得艾莉亚立刻伸手去拔缝衣针，但那不过是窗板被风吹动的声音。经过之前的开阔河岸，小镇的封闭空间令她十分不安。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Arya found herself with Gendry, Hot Pie, and Lommy. Squat, kettle-bellied Woth had pulled an oar on a galley once, which made him the next best thing they had to a sailor, so Yoren told him to take them down to the lakefront and see if they could find a boat. As they rode between the silent white houses, gooseprickles crawled up Arya's arms. This empty town frightened her almost as much as the burnt holdfast where they'd found the crying girl and the one-armed woman. Why would people run off and leave their homes and everything? What could scare them so much?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="艾莉亚和詹德利、热派及罗米同组，还有又矮又胖的大肚子渥斯，他以前在船上划过桨，算是这群人里最像水手的人，所以尤伦指派他带着他们到湖边找船。策马经过寂静的白色房舍，艾莉亚手臂上起了鸡皮疙瘩。想起之前他们找到哭泣女孩和独臂女子的焚毁庄园，这座空无一人的小镇同样教她害怕。为什么这里的居民要抛下一切，逃离家园？他们究竟是被什么吓跑的？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When she glimpsed the lake ahead between houses and trees, Arya put her knees into her horse, galloping past Woth and Gendry. She burst out onto the grassy sward beside the pebbled shore. The setting sun made the tranquil surface of the water shimmer like a sheet of beaten copper. It was the biggest lake she had ever seen, with no hint of a far shore. She saw a rambling inn to her left, built out over the water on heavy wooden pilings. To her right, a long pier jutted into the lake, and there were other docks farther east, wooden fingers reaching out from the town. But the only boat in view was an upside-down rowboat abandoned on the rocks beneath the inn, its bottom thoroughly rotted out. "They're gone," Arya said, dejected. What would they do now?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以当艾莉亚从房屋和树林的缝隙间看见前方的湖泊，立刻催马跑过渥斯和詹德利，冲上岸边多石的草地。在落日余晖的照映下，平静的湖面闪闪发光，有如一大片铜箔。她这辈子从没见过这么大的湖，看不到边际。左方湖面有栋大旅店，建筑在厚重的木桩上。右边则有一座长长的码头伸入湖中，更往东去还有其他码头，活像从镇上伸出的木指。但放眼望去，只有一艘倒置的划艇，遗弃于旅店下的礁石上，船底都烂穿了。“他们都走了。”艾莉亚沮丧地说。这下该怎么办？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="渥斯喊着要她帮忙找寻，于是她让马沿岸吃草，自己则探头进船屋和货棚里搜索。他们找到一些船帆、几堆钉子、几桶硬焦油，还有一只刚产下一窝小猫的母猫，但偏偏没有船。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"They took the boats." Somehow Arya knew it was true; they could search the whole town, and they'd find no more than the upside-down rowboat. Despondent, she climbed off her horse and knelt by the lake. The water lapped softly around her legs. A few lantern bugs were coming out, their little lights blinking on and off. The green water was warm as tears, but there was no salt in it. It tasted of summer and mud and growing things. Arya plunged her face down into it to wash off the dust and dirt and sweat of the day. When she leaned back the trickles ran down the back of her neck and under her collar. They felt good. She wished she could take off her clothes and swim, gliding through the warm water like a skinny pink otter. Maybe she could swim all the way to Winterfell.</div>

<div class="line_en">The holdfast gates were studded with iron nails. Within, they found a pair of iron bars the size of saplings, with post holes in the ground and metal brackets on the gate. When they slotted the bars through the brackets, they made a huge X brace. It was no Red Keep, Yoren announced when they'd explored the holdfast top to bottom, but it was better than most, and should do for a night well enough. The walls were rough unmortared stone ten feet high, with a wooden catwalk inside the battlements. There was a postern gate to the north, and Gerren discovered a trap under the straw in the old wooden barn, leading to a narrow, winding tunnel. He followed it a long way under the earth and came out by the lake. Yoren had them roll a wagon on top of the trap, to make certain no one came in that way. He divided them into three watches, and sent Tarber, Kurz, and Cutjack off to the abandoned towerhouse to keep an eye out from on high. Kurz had a hunting horn to sound if danger threatened.</div>

<div class="line_en">When the food was ready, Arya ate a chicken leg and a bit of onion. No one talked much, not even Lommy. Gendry went off by himself afterward, polishing his helm with a look on his face like he wasn't even there. The crying girl whimpered and wept, but when Hot Pie offered her a bit of goose she gobbled it down and looked for more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="晚餐煮好之后，艾莉亚吃了一根鸡腿和一点洋葱。大家都没多说话，连罗米也不例外。饭后，詹德利独自走到一边去擦拭头盔，脸上一副神游天外的表情。小女孩依旧啼哭不止，可热派一拿鹅肉喂她，她立刻大口吞下，然后睁大眼睛索要。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They drove their wagons and animals inside and barred the gates behind them. The barn was a ramshackle thing, large enough to hold half the animals in the town. The haven, where the townfolk would shelter in times of trouble, was even larger, low and long and built of stone, with a thatched roof. Koss went out the postern gate and brought the goose back, and two chickens as well, and Yoren allowed a cookfire. There was a big kitchen inside the holdfast, though all the pots and kettles had been taken. Gendry, Dobber, and Arya drew cook duty. Dobber told Arya to pluck the fowl while Gendry split wood. "Why can't I split the wood?" she asked, but no one listened. Sullenly, she set to plucking a chicken while Yoren sat on the end of the bench sharpening the edge of his dirk with a whetstone.</div>

<div class="line_en">Arya drew second watch, so she found a straw pallet in the haven. Sleep did not come easy, so she borrowed Yoren's stone and set to honing Needle. Syrio Forel had said that a dull blade was like a lame horse. Hot Pie squatted on the pallet beside her, watching her work. "Where'd you get a good sword like that?" he asked. When he saw the look she gave him, he raised his hands defensively. "I never said you stole it, I just wanted to know where you got it, is all."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="艾莉亚抽的是第二班守夜，所以她先到避难所里找了个稻草垫休息。然而她睡不着，便问尤伦借了颗磨刀石，磨起了缝衣针。西利欧·佛瑞尔曾说：钝剑有如跛马。热派蹲在她身旁的草垫上看她磨剑。“你打哪儿弄来这么好一把剑啊？”他开口问，一见她的眼神，赶忙防卫性地举手，“我又没说你偷东西，我只想知道你从哪儿弄来的，就这样而已。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She must have slept, though she never remembered closing her eyes. She dreamed a wolf was howling, and the sound was so terrible that it woke her at once. Arya sat up on her pallet with her heart thumping. "Hot Pie, wake up." She scrambled to her feet. "Woth, Gendry, didn't you hear?" She pulled on a boot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她一定是睡着了，虽然她根本不记得阖眼。在梦中，她听见一只狼的嗥叫，声调恐怖，立刻把她惊醒。艾莉亚在草垫上坐起身子，心脏怦怦狂跳。“热派，快醒醒！”她摇晃着起身。“渥斯！詹德利！你们没听见吗？”她穿上一只靴子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Arry has wolves in his head," sneered Lommy. "Let them howl," Gerren said, "they're out there, we're in here." Woth agreed. "Never saw no wolf could storm a holdfast." Hot Pie was saying, "I never heard nothing."</div>

In a heartbeat, all of them were pulling on clothes and snatching for whatever weapons they owned. Arya ran for the gate as the horn sounded again. As she dashed past the barn, Biter threw himself furiously against his chains, and Jaqen H'ghar called out from the back of their wagon. "Boy! Sweet boy! Is it war, red war? Boy, free us. A man can fight. Boy!" She ignored him and plunged on. By then she could hear horses and shouts beyond the wall.</div>

<div class="line_en">Arya tried to count, but they were riding too fast, torches spinning through the air as they flung them. "A hundred," she said. "Two hundred, I don't know." Over the roar of the flames, she could hear shouts. "They'll come for us soon."</div>

<div class="line_en">Ser Amory had no ladders, but the holdfast walls were rough-cut and unmortared, easy to climb, and there seemed to be no end to the foes. For each one Arya cut or stabbed or shoved back, another was coming over the wall. The knight in the spiked helm reached the rampart, but Yoren tangled his black banner around his spike, and forced the point of his dirk through his armor while the man was fighting the cloth. Every time Arya looked up, more torches were flying, trailing long tongues of flame that lingered behind her eyes. She saw a gold lion on a red banner and thought of Joffrey, wishing he was here so she could drive Needle through his sneery face. When four men assaulted the gate with axes, Koss shot them down with arrows, one by one. Dobber wrestled a man off the walk, and Lommy smashed his head with a rock before he could rise, and hooted until he saw the knife in Dobber's belly and realized he wouldn't be getting up either. Arya jumped over a dead boy no older than Jon, lying with his arm cut off. She didn't think she'd done it, but she wasn't sure. She heard Qyle beg for mercy before a knight with a wasp on his shield smashed his face in with a spiked mace. Everything smelled of blood and smoke and iron and piss, but after a time it seemed like that was only one smell. She never saw how the skinny man got over the wall, but when he did she fell on him with Gendry and Hot Pie. Gendry's sword shattered on the man's helm, tearing it off his head. Underneath he was bald and scared-looking, with missing teeth and a speckly grey beard, but even as she was feeling sorry for him she was killing him, shouting, "Winterfell! Winterfell!" while Hot Pie screamed "Hot Pie!" beside her as he hacked at the man's scrawny neck.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="亚摩利爵士没有梯子，但庄园的围墙乃是粗石砌成，很容易爬。敌人似乎永无止尽。艾莉亚每砍倒、刺落、推下一个人，就又有一个爬上城墙。戴尖刺盔的骑士也登上了防御工事，但尤伦用黑旗缠住他盔顶的刺，趁那人拉扯斗篷时，利落一刀，刺穿了他的铠甲。艾莉亚每次抬头，便看到更多火把飞进庄园，在她眼底印下长长的火舌。她看到红旗上的金狮，想起了乔佛里，恨不得他也在场，好让她用缝衣针一剑刺烂他那张充满讥笑的臭脸。有四个士兵拿斧头劈门，却被寇斯一个个射死。道柏和另一人在走道上扭打跌倒。罗米趁那人还不及起身，便用石块把他的头砸个稀烂，他得意地怪叫几声，却发现道柏腹部插了把小刀，这才明白道柏也起不来了。艾莉亚跳过一具断手尸体，这人还是个大男孩，年纪看来和琼恩差不多。她相信这不是自己做的，但不敢确定。她听见奎尔向一名盾牌有黄蜂图案的骑士讨饶，却被对方手中的钉头锤打烂了脸。到处都是血、烟、铁和尿的味道，久而久之也便成了同一种味道。她不知眼前这个瘦巴巴的人是怎么爬上来的，但她和詹德利以及热派立刻扑了上去。詹德利砍落他的头盔，剑却断了。来人是个光头，少了几颗牙齿，生了一把灰斑胡须，模样很害怕。她虽然可怜他，但还是下了手，口中一边喊：“临冬城万岁！临冬城万岁！”热派则在她身边大叫：“热派！”，然后砍劈他的瘦颈子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She slashed down hard, and Needle's castle-forged steel bit into the grasping fingers between the knuckles. "Winterfell!" she screamed. Blood spurted, fingers flew, and the helmed face vanished as suddenly as it had appeared. "Behind!" Hot Pie yelled. Arya whirled. The second man was bearded and helmetless, his dirk between his teeth to leave both hands free for climbing. As he swung his leg over the parapet, she drove her point at his eyes. Needle never touched him; he reeled backward and fell. I hope he falls on his face and cuts off his tongue. "Watch them, not me!" she screamed at Hot Pie. The next time someone tried to climb their part of the wall, the boy hacked at his hands with his shortsword until the man dropped away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她用力向下一砍，缝衣针那由城堡铁匠打出来的精钢剑刃正中对方攀爬的指节之间。“临冬城万岁！”她尖叫。鲜血喷溅，手指分家，刚出现的脸来去匆匆。“后面！”热派大喊。艾莉亚立刻旋身，只见另一个没戴头盔的大胡子，用牙齿咬住短刀，双手攀爬。他的腿刚跨过胸墙，艾莉亚便持剑朝他眼睛戳去。缝衣针没碰着他，他往后躲开，摔下了城墙。希望他摔个狗吃屎，咬断自己舌头。“看着他们，不要看我！”她对热派吼。随后又有一个人想爬上他们这段墙，男孩便死命挥舞短剑砍他的手，直到那人松手坠落。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When the skinny man was dead, Gendry stole his sword and leapt down into the yard to fight some more. Arya looked past him, and saw steel shadows running through the holdfast, firelight shining off mail and blades, and she knew that they'd gotten over the wall somewhere, or broken through at the postern. She jumped down beside Gendry, landing the way Syrio had taught her. The night rang to the clash of steel and the cries of the wounded and dying. For a moment Arya stood uncertain, not knowing which way to go. Death was all around her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="瘦子死后，詹德利拿了他的剑，飞身跳进庭院继续战斗。艾莉亚环顾四周，发现许多钢铁阴影正在庄里跑动，火光在铠甲和刀剑上闪亮。她知道一定有人登上城墙，要不就是小门被攻破了。她往下跳到詹德利身边，用西利欧教的方式落地。刀剑声和伤者的哀嚎响彻夜空，一时之间艾莉亚楞在原地，不知该往何处去。四面八方都是死亡。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And then Yoren was there, shaking her, screaming in her face. "Boy!" he yelled, the way he always yelled it. "Get out, it's done, we've lost. Herd up all you can, you and him and the others, the boys, you get them out. Now!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然间尤伦出现，他用力摇她，朝她大吼，“小子！”他用他惯有的方式叫道，“你快走！这儿没救了，咱们输了！你们俩能救几个孩子算几个，快带他们出去！快去！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Quick as that he was gone, off to fight, sword in hand. Arya grabbed Gendry by the arm. "He said go," she shouted, "the barn, the way out." Through the slits of his helm, the Bull's eyes shone with reflected fire. He nodded. They called Hot Pie down from the wall and found Lommy Greenhands where he lay bleeding from a spear thrust through his calf. They found Gerren too, but he was hurt too bad to move. As they were running toward the barn, Arya spied the crying girl sitting in the middle of the chaos, surrounded by smoke and slaughter. She grabbed her by the hand and pulled her to her feet as the others raced ahead. The girl wouldn't walk, even when slapped. Arya dragged her with her right hand while she held Needle in the left. Ahead, the night was a sullen red. The barn's on fire, she thought. Flames were licking up its sides from where a torch had fallen on straw, and she could hear the screaming of the animals trapped within. Hot Pie stepped out of the barn. "Arry, come on! Lommy's gone, leave her if she won't come!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说音刚落，他又立刻持剑投入战斗。艾莉亚捉住詹德利的手臂，“他叫我们走！”她高喊，“从谷仓出去！”在头盔的缝隙中，大牛的眼睛映着火光。他点点头，随后两人把热派从墙上叫下来，接着找到绿手罗米，他躺在地上，小腿被枪刺穿，血流不止。他们还找到格伦，但他伤势太重，无法行动。当他们朝谷仓跑去时，艾莉亚不经意间瞥见小女孩坐在一团混乱中大哭，四周全是浓烟和杀戮。她抓住女孩的手，一把拉起来，其他人则继续向前跑。女孩不肯前进，打也没用，艾莉亚只得用右手拖她，左手握好缝衣针。前方的夜幕是一片暗红，谷仓着火了，她想。烈火正自一根落在稻草堆上的火把朝四处蔓延，她可以听见被困其中的牲口惨嚎。热派跑出谷仓，“阿利，快点！罗米已经走了！她要是不来就别管她！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The open trap was only a few feet ahead, but the fire was spreading fast, consuming the old wood and dry straw faster than she would have believed. Arya remembered the Hound's horrible burned face. "Tunnel's narrow," Gendry shouted. "How do we get her through?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="打开的暗门近在咫尺，然而火势蔓延极快，以难以置信的速度吞噬着朽木和干草。艾莉亚想起猎狗被灼伤的恐怖面容。“通道很窄，”詹德利喊，“我们该怎么把她弄出去？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stubbornly, Arya dragged all the harder, pulling the crying girl along.

<div class="line_en">Rushing through the barn doors was like running into a furnace. The air was swirling with smoke, the back wall a sheet of fire ground to roof. Their horses and donkeys were kicking and rearing and screaming. The poor animals, Arya thought. Then she saw the wagon, and the three men manacled to its bed. Biter was flinging himself against the chains, blood running down his arms from where the irons clasped his wrists. Rorge screamed curses, kicking at the wood. "Boy!" called Jaqen H'ghar. "Sweet boy!"</div>

<div class="line_en">"You take her!" she yelled. "You get her out! You do it!" The fire beat at her back with hot red wings as she fled the burning barn. It felt blessedly cool outside, but men were dying all around her. She saw Koss throw down his blade to yield, and she saw them kill him where he stood. Smoke was everywhere. There was no sign of Yoren, but the axe was where Gendry had left it, by the woodpile outside the haven. As she wrenched it free, a mailed hand grabbed her arm. Spinning, Arya drove the head of the axe hard between his legs. She never saw his face, only the dark blood seeping between the links of his hauberk. Going back into that barn was the hardest thing she ever did. Smoke was pouring out the open door like a writhing black snake, and she could hear the screams of the poor animals inside, donkeys and horses and men. She chewed her lip, and darted through the doors, crouched low where the smoke wasn't quite so thick.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你带着她！”她喊道，“你带她走！交给你了！”说完她逃出燃烧的谷仓。烈焰挥动红热的翅膀，不断拍打驱赶着她。相较之下，仓外真是凉爽极了，但四面八方都是死人。她看见寇斯弃剑投降，却当场被杀。到处浓烟滚滚，她找不到尤伦，不过斧头果真如詹德利所说，就在避难所外的柴堆旁。她刚拔出斧头，便被一只铁手抓住。艾莉亚旋身，用力一挥，劈中那人两腿中间。她没看到对方的脸，只见他锁甲间汩汩流出的暗红血液。回谷仓是她这辈子所做过最艰难的事，浓烟如一条不停扭动的黑蛇，窜出敞开的大门，她可以听见谷仓内可怜牲口的哀嚎，驴鸣、马嘶，人的惨叫。她咬紧牙关，冲了进去，身子压低，因为底下的烟没那么浓。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A donkey was caught in a ring of fire, shrieking in terror and pain. She could smell the stench of burning hair. The roof was gone up too, and things were falling down, pieces of flaming wood and bits of straw and hay. Arya put a hand over her mouth and nose. She couldn't see the wagon for the smoke, but she could still hear Biter screaming. She crawled toward the sound.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一只驴子困在大火之中，惊恐又痛苦地惨嚎，她闻到驴毛烧焦的臭味。屋顶也烧起来了，着火的木板和干草支离破碎，纷纷落下。艾莉亚伸手捂住口鼻，虽然因为浓烟的关系，她看不到马车，却可听见尖牙的狂叫，于是她朝声音的来源爬去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And then a wheel was looming over her. The wagon jumped and moved a half foot when Biter threw himself against his chains again. Jaqen saw her, but it was too hard to breathe, let alone talk. She threw the axe into the wagon. Rorge caught it and lifted it over his head, rivers of sooty sweat pouring down his noseless face. Arya was running, coughing. She heard the steel crash through the old wood, and again, again. An instant later came a crack as loud as thunder, and the bottom of the wagon came ripping loose in an explosion of splinters.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="很快，大车轮出现在眼前。尖牙死命一扯铁链，马车整个跳将起来，移动了半尺。贾昆发现了她，但此刻四周已热得难以呼吸，遑论说话。她把斧头抛进车里，罗尔杰接住后高举过头，被烟灰染黑的汗水像小河般流下他无鼻的脸。艾莉亚边跑边咳，她听见斧头穿木的声音，一下接一下，没过多久，传来一声轰然巨响，碎木飞溅，马车底部完全裂开。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Arya rolled headfirst into the tunnel and dropped five feet. She got dirt in her mouth but she didn't care, the taste was fine, the taste was mud and water and worms and life. Under the earth the air was cool and dark. Above was nothing but blood and roaring red and choking smoke and the screams of dying horses. She moved her belt around so Needle would not be in her way, and began to crawl. A dozen feet down the tunnel she heard the sound, like the roar of some monstrous beast, and a cloud of hot smoke and black dust came billowing up behind her, smelling of hell. Arya held her breath and kissed the mud on the floor of the tunnel and cried. For whom, she could not say.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="艾莉亚翻个筋斗，滚入通道，掉了五尺落地。嘴里都是泥土，但她一点也不在乎，味道不错，泥土、水流、虫子和生命的味道。地底的空气阴凉而幽暗，地上惟有血腥杀戮、红色烈焰、呛人黑烟，以及人畜濒死的惨叫。她挪动腰带，使缝衣针不妨碍行动，接着开始爬。爬下十来尺，背后传来巨响，有如庞然怪兽的咆哮，接着一团热气和黑烟从身后呼地涌至，其味彷如地狱。艾莉亚屏住呼吸，亲吻地道的泥土，痛哭失声。究竟为谁，她自己也不清楚。">查看中文翻译</div>
