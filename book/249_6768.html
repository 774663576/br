<div class="line_en">Two years swept by in a splendid delirium, the intoxicated Fosters scarcely noticing the flight of time. They were now worth three hundred million dollars; they were in every board of directors of every prodigious combine in the country; and still as time drifted along, the millions went on piling up, five at a time, ten at a time, as fast as they could tally them off, almost. The three hundred double itself -- then doubled again -- and yet again -- and yet once more.</div>

<div class="line_en">It were a weariness to follow in detail the leaps and bounds the Foster fictitious finances took from this time forth. It was marvelous, it was dizzying, it was dazzling. Everything Aleck touched turned to fairy gold, and heaped itself glittering toward the firmament. Millions upon millions poured in, and still the mighty stream flowed thundering along, still its vast volume increased. Five millions -- ten millions -- twenty -- thirty -- was there never to be an end?</div>

<div class="line_en">The business was getting a little confused. It was necessary to take an account of stock, and straighten it out. The Fosters knew it, they felt it, they realized that it was imperative; but they also knew that to do it properly and perfectly the task must be carried to a finish without a break when once it was begun. A ten-hours' job; and where could THEY find ten leisure hours in a bunch? Sally was selling pins and sugar and calico all day and every day; Aleck was cooking and washing dishes and sweeping and making beds all day and every day, with none to help, for the daughters were being saved up for high society. The Fosters knew there was one way to get the ten hours, and only one. Both were ashamed to name it; each waited for the other to do it. Finally Sally said:</div>

<div class="line_en">After that, they broke the Sabbaths right along as fast as they turned up. It is the first wrong step that counts. Every Sunday they put in the whole day, after morning service, on inventions -- inventions of ways to spend the money. They got to continuing this delicious dissipation until past midnight; and at every s'eance Aleck lavished millions upon great charities and religious enterprises, and Sally lavished like sums upon matters to which (at first) he gave definite names. Only at first. Later the names gradually lost sharpness of outline, and eventually faded into "sundries," thus becoming entirely -- but safely -- undescriptive. For Sally was crumbling. The placing of these millions added seriously and most uncomfortably to the family expenses -- in tallow candles. For a while Aleck was worried. Then, after a little, she ceased to worry, for the occasion of it was gone. She was pained, she was grieved, she was ashamed; but she said nothing, and so became an accessory. Sally was taking candles; he was robbing the store. It is ever thus. Vast wealth, to the person unaccustomed to it, is a bane; it eats into the flesh and bone of his morals. When the Fosters were poor, they could have been trusted with untold candles. But now they -- but let us not dwell upon it. From candles to apples is but a step: Sally got to taking apples; then soap; then maple-sugar; then canned goods; then crockery. How easy it is to go from bad to worse, when once we have started upon a downward course!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一旦发现了这个诀窍，从此以后，他们就不再守安息日的老规矩了。每个周日的晨祷以后，他们整整一天都用来编排——编排花钱的门道。这种美妙的消费活动总是持续到午夜过后。每次花钱大赛时，艾莱柯都大大方方地拿出几百万，施舍给知名慈善机构和教会产业。萨利也出手阔绰，拿出同样数目的钱，花在一些项目上。一开始他还给这些项目分别冠以固定的名目。这只是刚开始的时候。后来这些名目逐渐失去了鲜明的特色，最终淡化成“杂项类”，全都变成不清不白的名目了——这样做倒是安全。因为萨利已经开始瞎折腾了。安排这些数以百万计的巨款增加了家庭开支——买蜡烛的费用，这是一个严肃而极为棘手的问题。艾莱柯为这件事发过愁，很快就不再发愁了，因为发愁的根源已经不复存在。她也曾痛苦过，伤心过，害臊过；不过她保持了沉默，成了一个同谋。萨利开始偷蜡烛了，从商店往回偷。事情从来都是如此。巨额财富对穷惯了的人是一剂毒药，会连皮带骨吞噬他的良心。福斯特夫妇过穷日子的时候，交给他们多少蜡烛都能信得过。可是，如今他们——我们先不涉及这个问题。从偷蜡烛到偷苹果只有一步之遥：萨利开始偷苹果；后来是肥皂；再往后是枫糖、罐头、陶器。只要我们一开始走下坡路，越变越坏可真容易呀！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Meantime, other effects had been milestoning the course of the Fosters' splendid financial march. The fictitious brick dwelling had given place to an imaginary granite one with a checker-board mansard roof; in time this one disappeared and gave place to a still grander home -- and so on and so on. Mansion after mansion, made of air, rose, higher, broader, finer, and each in its turn vanished away; until now in these latter great days, our dreamers were in fancy housed, in a distant region, in a sumptuous vast palace which looked out from a leafy summit upon a noble prospect of vale and river and receding hills steeped in tinted mists -- and all private, all the property of the dreamers; a palace swarming with liveried servants, and populous with guests of fame and power, hailing from all the world's capitals, foreign and domestic.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="与此同时，福斯特夫妇气吞山河的金融进程中又有了其他里程碑式的标志。那栋虚构的砖楼换成了一幢花岗岩造的有棋盘格子复式屋顶的建筑；后来，这幢房子也不见了，让位于一幢更加气派的住宅——如此等等。一幢又一幢建在虚空中的豪宅拔地而起，一幢比一幢更高，更宽敞，更精美，然后又一幢跟着一幢地无影无踪了。一直到后来这些大喜的日子，咱们的梦乡客已经住进了一座宫殿式的豪宅，这是一座山顶建筑，四周树木葱茏，宫殿俯瞰着山谷、河流以及云雾缭绕的层峦叠蟑——这都是私产，都归两位幻想者所有。宫殿里仆从如云，个个穿着制服，来自世界各大都市的名流权贵济济一堂，外宾内宾齐备。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This palace was far, far away toward the rising sun, immeasurably remote, astronomically remote, in Newport, Rhode Island, Holy Land of High Society, ineffable Domain of the American Aristocracy. As a rule they spent a part of every Sabbath -- after morning service -- in this sumptuous home, the rest of it they spent in Europe, or in dawdling around in their private yacht. Six days of sordid and plodding fact life at home on the ragged edge of Lakeside and straitened means, the seventh in Fairlyand -- such had been their program and their habit.</div>

<div class="line_en">In their sternly restricted fact life they remained as of old -- plodding, diligent, careful, practical, economical. They stuck loyally to the little Presbyterian Church, and labored faithfully in its interests and stood by its high and tough doctrines with all their mental and spiritual energies. But in their dream life they obeyed the invitations of their fancies, whatever they might be, and howsoever the fancies might change. Aleck's fancies were not very capricious, and not frequent, but Sally's scattered a good deal. Aleck, in her dream life, went over to the Episcopal camp, on account of its large official titles; next she became High-church on account of the candles and shows; and next she naturally changed to Rome, where there were cardinals and more candles. But these excursions were a nothing to Sally's. His dream life was a glowing and continuous and persistent excitement, and he kept every part of it fresh and sparkling by frequent changes, the religious part along with the rest. He worked his religions hard, and changed them with his shirt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在处处受到制约的现实生活中，他们仍然像往日那样——艰难度日、克勤克俭、小心翼翼、脚踏实地。他们一直对长老会的小教堂忠心耿耿，发自内心地为教会做事，全心全意地恪守神圣而严格的教规。可是在他们的虚幻生活中，他们却追随着幻想的诱惑，却不计较这幻想的性质和变化。艾莱柯的幻想还不算特别反复无常，而萨利的幻想却已经乱了套。艾莱柯在她的虚幻生活中，先是信主教派，因为这个教派的头面人物都有来头；然后改信高教派，这是因为那里的蜡烛点得多，场面比较讲究；自然，后来她又皈依罗马天主教会，因为他们有红衣主教，蜡烛点得更多。可是艾莱柯的这些花样在萨利看来没有一点意思。他的幻想生活是一幅热情奔放、永无止境的激动人心场面，这个千变万化的过程，保证了每一个场景都新鲜活泼、光彩照人，连宗教活动也是如此。他勤奋地参与宗教活动，像换衬衫似的变换花样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This rude and unfeeling language hurt Aleck to the heart, and she went from the presence crying. That spectacle went to his own heart, and in his pain and shame he would have given worlds to have those unkind words back. She had uttered no syllable of reproach -- and that cut him. Not one suggestion that he look at his own record -- and she could have made, oh, so many, and such blistering ones! Her generous silence brought a swift revenge, for it turned his thoughts upon himself, it summoned before him a spectral procession, a moving vision of his life as he had been leading it these past few years of limitless prosperity, and as he sat there reviewing it his cheeks burned and his soul was steeped in humiliation. Look at her life -- how fair it was, and tending ever upward; and look at his own -- how frivolous, how charged with mean vanities, how selfish, how empty, how ignoble! And its trend -- never upward, but downward, ever downward!</div>

<div class="line_en">The liberal spendings of the Fosters upon their fancies began early in their prosperities, and grew in prodigality step by step with their advancing fortunes. In time they became truly enormous. Aleck built a university or two per Sunday; also a hospital or two; also a Rowton hotel or so; also a batch of churches; now and then a cathedral; and once, with untimely and ill-chosen playfulness, Sally said, "It was a cold day when she didn't ship a cargo of missionaries to persuade unreflecting Chinamen to trade off twenty-four carat Confucianism for counterfeit Christianity."</div>
