<div class="line_en">Calm down, I order myself. It's not as if this is the first time I've been caught outside of the district by an electrified fence. It's happened a few times over the years, but Gale was always with me. The two of us would just pick a comfortable tree to hang out in until the power shut off, which it always did eventually. If I was running late, Prim even got in the habit of going to the Meadow to check if the fence was charged, to spare my mother worry.</div>

<div class="line_en">My feet back up automatically and I blend into the trees. I cover my mouth with my glove to disperse the white of my breath in the icy air. Adrenaline courses through me, wiping all the concerns of the day from my mind as I focus on the immediate threat before me. What is going on? Has Thread turned on the fence as an additional security precaution? Or does he somehow know I've escaped his net today? Is he determined to strand me outside District 12 until he can apprehend and arrest me? Drag me to the square to be locked in the stockade or whipped or hanged?</div>

<div class="line_en">But today my family would never imagine I'd be in the woods. I've even taken steps to mislead them. So if I don't show up, worry they will. And there's a part of me that's worried, too, because I'm not sure it's just a coincidence, the power coming on the very day I return to the woods. I thought no one saw me sneak under the fence, but who knows? There are always eyes for hire. Someone reported Gale kissing me in that very spot. Still, that was in daylight and before I was more careful about my behavior. Could there be surveillance cameras? I've wondered about this before. Is this the way President Snow knows about the kiss? It was dark when I went under and my face was bundled in a scarf. But the list of suspects likely to be trespassing into the woods is probably very short.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可今天，家人无论如何都不会想到我咆到林子里去了，我甚至还故意骗了她们。我没按时回家，她们一定很担心。恰恰在我钻进树林的这一天，隔离网就通了电，我不敢肯定这是否只是巧合，因此我也有些焦虑。我觉得没人看见我从隔离网下钻过去，可谁又能说得准呢？总有人被雇来做眼线。就在这个地方盖尔吻了我，不是已有人报告吗？当然，那是白天发生的事，我那时也不太审慎。会不会有监视摄像头呢？我以前曾怀疑过。斯诺总统是不是用这种办法来获知我们接吻的事？我今早钻出来时天还没亮，脸也裹在厚厚的围巾里，应该不会被发现，但是，敢于越过隔离网进入林子的人恐怕也没几个呀。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My eyes peer through the trees, past the fence, into the Meadow. All I can see is the wet snow illuminated here and there by the light from the windows on the edge of the Seam. No Peacekeepers in sight, no signs I am being hunted. Whether Thread knows I left the district today or not, I realize my course of action must be the same: to get back inside the fence unseen and pretend I never left.</div>

<div class="line_en">Any contact with the chain link or the coils of barbed wire that guard the top would mean instant electrocution. I don't think I can burrow under the fence without risking detection, and the ground's frozen hard, anyway. That leaves only one choice. Somehow I'm going to have to go over it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="只要与隔离网或隔离网顶端的带刺铁丝网稍微一接触，人就立刻会触电身亡。我恐怕很难从网底下钻过去，更何况此时地面还冻得铁硬。那么就只有一种选择啦，不管怎样我得从这里过去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I begin to skirt along the tree line, searching for a tree with a branch high and long enough to fit my needs. After about a mile, I come upon an old maple that might do. The trunk is too wide and icy to shinny up, though, and there are no low branches. I climb a neighboring tree and leap precariously into the maple, almost losing my hold on the slick bark. But I manage to get a grip and slowly inch my way out on a limb that hangs above the barbed wire.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我顺着隔离网往前走，仍不敢离开树林。我想找一棵高度适当的大树，从树权上翻过隔离网。大约走了一英里，终于看到一棵高大的枫树，这树兴许能行。可树干粗大，树皮结了冰很滑，且树上也没有低矮的树枝，很难攀爬。于是我爬上邻近的一棵树，纵身一跃，跳到这棵枫树上，可树皮湿滑，我身体一晃险些失手。我尽量稳住身体，慢慢地爬到一根横在隔离网上方的树枝上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As I look down, I remember why Gale and I always waited in the woods rather than try to tackle the fence. Being high enough to avoid getting fried means you've got to be at least twenty feet in the air. I guess my branch must be twenty-five. That's a dangerously long drop, even for someone who's had years of practice in trees. But what choice do I have? I could look for another branch, but it's almost dark now. The falling snow will obscure any moonlight. Here, at least, I can see I've got a snowbank to cushion my landing. Even if I could find another, which is doubtful, who knows what I'd be jumping into? I throw my empty game bag around my neck and slowly lower myself until I'm hanging by my hands. For a moment, I gather my courage. Then I release my fingers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爬到树上，我才明白了当时我和盖尔为什么宁肯等到断电也不愿翻越隔离网的原因。要想不被电击，就要爬到足够高的地方，而那里距地足有二十英尺，我估摸着现在爬的这个树权有二十五英尺高。从这么高的地方跳下去，就算对有多年爬树经验的人也很危险。可我又有什么别的办法呢？我可以再找一根树权，可现在天已经几乎完全黑了。不断飘落的雪花也会使月光昏暗不明。在这个地方，至少我可以看到地上有一个小雪堆，可以减弱我撞击地面的冲击力。就算我还能找到一根树权——天晓得我是否能找得到，我也不知道要跳下去的地面会是什么情况。我把空猎物袋挎在肩上，然后慢慢地向下移动，用双手吊在树权上。我略停了停，给自己鼓鼓劲，之后就松开了抓住树权的双手。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There's the sensation of falling, then I hit the ground with a jolt that goes right up my spine. A second later, my rear end slams the ground. I lie in the snow, trying to assess the damage. Without standing, I can tell by the pain in my left heel and my tailbone that I'm injured. The only question is how badly. I'm hoping for bruises, but when I force myself onto my feet, I suspect I've broken something as well. I can walk, though, so I get moving, trying to hide my limp as best I can.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我咣当一下跌落在地上，触地的瞬间，一股强烈的震荡顺着我的脊椎而上，之后，我屁股着地。我躺在雪地里，思量着自己摔得到底有多重。我还没站起来，从左脚后跟和尾骨的疼痛就知道自己受伤了。唯一问题是摔得有多重？我希望只是摔得青红片紫，可当我强撑着站起来时，我觉得一定有根骨头摔断了。不管怎样，我还勉强能走，所以我慢慢地向前挪动身子，尽量不显出自己一拐一拐的样子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My mother and Prim can't know I was in the woods. I need to work up some sort of alibi, no matter how thin. Some of the shops in the square are still open, so I go in one and purchase white cloth for bandages. We're running low, anyway. In another, I buy a bag of sweets for Prim. I stick one of the candies in my mouth, feeling the peppermint melt on my tongue, and realize it's the first thing I've eaten all day. I meant to make a meal at the lake, but once I saw Twill and Bonnie's condition, it seemed wrong to take a single mouthful from them.</div>

<div class="line_en">Prim's dispatched to get my pajamas and robe. When I'm changed, my mother makes a snow pack for my left heel and props it up on a hassock. I eat three bowls of stew and half a loaf of bread while the others dine at the table. I stare at the fire, thinking of Bonnie and Twill, hoping that the heavy, wet snow has erased my tracks.</div>

<div class="line_en">Having stripped off my sock, my mother's fingers probe the bones in my left heel and I wince. "There might be a break," she says. She checks the other foot. "This one seems all right." She judges my tailbone to be badly bruised.</div>

<div class="line_en">My mother gives me a cup of chamomile tea with a dose of sleep syrup, and my eyelids begin to droop immediately. She wraps my bad foot, and Peeta volunteers to get me to bed. I start out by leaning on his shoulder, but I'm so wobbly he just scoops me up and carries me upstairs. He tucks me in and says good night but I catch his hand and hold him there. A side effect of the sleep syrup is that it makes people less inhibited, like white liquor, and I know I have to control my tongue. But I don't want him to go. In fact, I want him to climb in with me, to be there when the nightmares hit tonight. For some reason that I can't quite form, I know I'm not allowed to ask that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="妈妈给我倒了一杯黄春菊茶，里面掺进了催眠糖浆，我的眼皮很快就打起架来。她为我包扎了脚上的伤口，皮塔自告奋勇要扶我上床。开始，他扶着我，而我倚在他肩膀上，可我走起来摇摇晃晃，皮塔干脆把我抱起来，送到楼上。他给我掖好被子，向我道了晚安，刚要离开，我却一把抓住他的手，抱住了他。睡眠糖浆的副作用之一就是使人不再羞怯，它的作用就像酒精；可我清楚我必须管住自己的嘴。出于某种原因，我不能对他提出这样的要求。">查看中文翻译</div>

Not just my heel and my tailbone. My whole body aches with exhaustion. So I let my mother doctor me and feed me breakfast in bed and tuck another quilt around me. Then I just lie there, staring out my window at the winter sky, pondering how on earth this will all turn out. I think a lot about Bonnie and Twill, and the pile of white wedding dresses downstairs, and if Thread will figure out how I got back in and arrest me. It's funny, because he could just arrest me, anyway, based on past crimes, but maybe he has to have something really irrefutable to do it, now that I'm a victor. And I wonder if President Snow's in contact with Thread. I think it's unlikely he ever acknowledged that old Cray existed, but now that I'm such a nationwide problem, is he carefully instructing Thread what to do? Or is Thread acting on his own? At any rate, I'm sure they'd both agree on keeping me locked up here inside the district with that fence. Even if I could figure out some way to escape -- maybe get a rope up to that maple tree branch and climb out -- there'd be no escaping with my family and friends now. I told Gale I would stay and fight, anyway.</div>

<div class="line_en">Peeta comes by every day to bring me cheese buns and begins to help me work on the family book. It's an old thing, made of parchment and leather. Some herbalist on my mother's side of the family started it ages ago. The book's composed of page after page of ink drawings of plants with descriptions of their medical uses. My father added a section on edible plants that was my guidebook to keeping us alive after his death. For a long time, I've wanted to record my own knowledge in it. Things I learned from experience or from Gale, and then the information I picked up when I was training for the Games. I didn't because I'm no artist and it's so crucial that the pictures are drawn in exact detail. That's where Peeta comes in. Some of the plants he knows already, others we have dried samples of, and others I have to describe. He makes sketches on scrap paper until I'm satisfied they're right, then I let him draw them in the book. After that, I carefully print all I know about the plant.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮塔每天都过来看我，给我带来奶酪面包，同时他开始帮助我完成我们家传的草药书的编写工作。这本书已经很旧了，是用羊皮纸和皮革做的。妈妈家的草药医生很多年前编的这本书。书上一页一页画着植物速写，同时有这种植物的药用价值的文字说明。爸爸在这本书里加入了可食用植物的内容，正是这些内容在他死后帮助我们活下来。很长时间以来，我就想把自己积累的知识加进去，包括从盖尔那里学来的东西，以及在参加饥饿游戏训练时学到的东西。但这件事我一直没做成，因为我不是艺术家，而植物的图画要细致而精确。现在正好皮塔可以帮忙。在需要画的植物中，有些他已经认识，另外一些有标本，再有一些要靠我的描述。他先在纸上打出草稿，直到我认为他画对了，满意为止，然后他再把图画到书上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For the next few days, I jump every time there's a knock on the door. No Peacekeepers show up to arrest me, though, so eventually I begin to relax. I'm further reassured when Peeta casually tells me the power is off in sections of the fence because crews are out securing the base of the chain link to the ground. Thread must believe I somehow got under the thing, even with that deadly current running through it. It's a break for the district, having the Peacekeepers busy doing something besides abusing people.</div>

<div class="line_en">It's quiet, absorbing work that helps take my mind off my troubles. I like to watch his hands as he works, making a blank page bloom with strokes of ink, adding touches of color to our previously black and yellowish book. His face takes on a special look when he concentrates. His usual easy expression is replaced by something more intense and removed that suggests an entire world locked away inside him. I've seen flashes of this before: in the arena, or when he speaks to a crowd, or that time he shoved the Peacekeepers' guns away from me in District 11. I don't know quite what to make of it. I also become a little fixated on his eyelashes, which ordinarily you don't notice much because they're so blond. But up close, in the sunlight slanting in from the window, they're a light golden color and so long I don't see how they keep from getting all tangled up when he blinks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="工作时，我们很安静，很专注，我也把烦心事都搁在一旁。皮塔画画时，我很喜欢看他的手，正是这双手使一张白纸充满了各种线条，又使原本黑黄的书页铺满色彩。他专心做事时，脸上有一种特殊的神情，平时表情轻松，现在却那么地凝神专注，仿佛整个世界都被锁在了外面。我以前也见过他这样：在竞技场时、在他对人群讲话时、还有那次在十一区他把治安警的枪口从我这里推开时，都曾有过。我不知道该用怎样的语言来形容。我又凝视他的睫毛。平时他的睫毛不太引人注意，那是因为颜色很浅。但从近处看睫毛很长，窗户射进的斜阳映出了它金黄的色调，我真纳闷他眨眼时睫毛为什么不会绞缠在一起。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Each afternoon he carries me downstairs for a change of scenery and I unnerve everyone by turning on the television. Usually we only watch when it's mandatory, because the mixture of propaganda and displays of the Capitol's power -- including clips from seventy-four years of Hunger Games -- is so odious. But now I'm looking for something special. The mockingjay that Bonnie and Twill are basing all their hopes on. I know it's probably foolishness, but if it is, I want to rule it out. And erase the idea of a thriving District 13 from my mind for good.</div>

The main newscaster is reading a piece about a shortage of graphite affecting the manufacturing of items in District 3. They cut to what is supposed to be live footage of a female reporter, encased in a protective suit, standing in front of the ruins of the Justice Building in 13. Through her mask, she reports that unfortunately a study has just today determined that the mines of District 13 are still too toxic to approach. End of story.
