<div class="line_en">I knelt there by Maxim's side, my body against his body, my hands upon his shoulders, and I was aware of no feeling at all, no pain and no fear, there was no horror in my heart. I thought how I must take the thorn out of Jasper's foot and I wondered if Robert would come in and clear the tea things. It seemed strange to me that I should think of these things, Jasper's foot, Maxim's watch, Robert and the tea things. I was shocked at my lack of emotion and this queer cold absence of distress. Little by little the feeling will come back to me, I said to myself, little by little I shall understand. What he has told me and all that has happened will tumble into place like pieces of a jig-saw puzzle. They will fit themselves into a pattern. At the moment I am nothing, I have no heart, and no mind, and no senses, I am just a wooden thing in Maxim's arms.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was very quiet in the library. The only sound was that of Jasper licking his foot. He must have caught a thorn in his pads, for he kept biting and sucking at the skin. Then I heard the watch on Maxim's wrist ticking close to my ear. The little normal sounds of every day. And for no reason the stupid proverb of my schooldays ran through my mind, "Time and Tide wait for no man." The words repeated themselves over and over again. "Time and Tide wait for no man." These were the only sounds then, the ticking of Maxim's watch and Jasper licking his foot on the floor beside me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="藏书室里安静极了，只听见杰斯珀呱哒呱哒舔脚掌。长耳狗一定踩了荆棘，皮肤里扎了刺，所以才老是啃啮吮吸个没完。接着，迈克西姆腕上手表的滴答声在耳畔响起，这种轻微的声音正标志着日复一日的生活常规。突然间，我脑海里无缘无故掠过一句学生时代常用的幼稚可爱的谚语：“岁月流逝不待人。”我翻来复去一再念叨这句话。“岁月流逝不待人。”就这样，迈克西姆的手表滴答不停，杰斯珀躺在我身旁的地板上舔脚掌；此外，藏书室里再没别的声响。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When people suffer a great shock, like death, or the loss of a limb, I believe they don't feel it just at first. If your hand is taken from you you don't know, for a few minutes, that your hand is gone. You go on feeling the fingers. You stretch and beat them on the air, one by one, and all the time there is nothing there, no hand, no fingers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我想，人们在承受巨大的突然打击之际，譬如说死亡，或是失去一条胳膊一条腿什么的，起初可能并没有感觉。假如别人砍去你的手，几分钟之内你并不意识到手已没了，而是照样觉得手指健在；你把手指一个又一个伸开，在空中挥舞，其实啥也没有，没有手，没有手指。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then he stopped suddenly, he pushed me away from him, and got up from the window-seat. "You see, I was right," he said. "It's too late. You don't love me now. Why should you?" He went and stood over by the mantelpiece. "We'll forget that," he said, "it won't happen again."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然，他一把将我推开，从临窗的座位上站起。“你看，我没说错，”他说。“太晚了！现在你不爱我了。干吗要爱呢？”他走到壁炉边站定。“就当我什么也没说，”他说。“我保证再也不讲这种傻话。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then he began to kiss me. He had not kissed me like this before. I put my hands behind his head and shut my eyes.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I love you so much," he whispered. "So much." This is what I have wanted him to say every day and every night, I thought, and now he is saying it at last. This is what I imagined in Monte Carlo, in Italy, here in Manderley. He is saying it now. I opened my eyes and looked at a little patch of curtain above his head. He went on kissing me, hungry, desperate, murmuring my name. I kept on looking at the patch of curtain, and saw where the sun had faded it, making it lighter than the piece above. "How calm I am," I thought. "How cool. Here I am looking at the piece of curtain, and Maxim is kissing me. For the first time he is telling me he loves me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我多么爱你，”他在我耳畔柔声低语。“多么多么地爱你。”我想，日日夜夜，我一直希望能听到他说这句话，现在他终于说了。早在蒙特卡洛，在意大利，还有在回到曼陀丽之后，我曾多少次想像过这一幕。他终于说了。我睁开眼，看着他头顶上方那一小角帷幕，他还是如饥似渴地尽情吻我，一边喃喃唤着我的名字。我仍然望着帷幕，发现帷幕上有一小块因日光曝洒而褪了色，不如顶上的一幅鲜艳。我又想，此刻我多么镇定而冷静，眼睛盯着那角帷幕，任迈克西姆亲吻。生平第一次，他对我说他爱我。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The feeling was coming back to me, little by little, as I knew it would. My hands were cold no longer. They were clammy, warm. I felt a wave of colour come into my face, my throat. My cheeks were burning hot. I thought of Captain Searle, the diver, the Lloyd's agent, all those men on the stranded ship leaning against the side, staring down into the water. I thought of the shopkeepers in Kerrith, of errand boys whistling in the street, of the vicar walking out of church, of Lady Crowan cutting roses in her garden, of the woman in the pink dress and her little boy on the cliffs. Soon they would know. In a few hours. By breakfast time tomorrow. "They've found Mrs de Winter's boat, and they say there is a body in the cabin." A body in the cabin. Rebecca was lying there on the cabin floor. She was not in the crypt at all. Some other woman was lying in the crypt. Maxim had killed Rebecca.</div>

<div class="line_en">Rebecca had not been drowned at all. Maxim had killed her. He had shot her in the cottage in the woods. He had carried her body to the boat, and sunk the boat there in the bay. That grey, silent cottage, with the rain pattering on the roof. The jig-saw pieces came tumbling thick and fast upon me. Disjointed pictures flashed one by one through my bewildered mind. Maxim sitting in the car beside me in the south of France. "Something happened nearly a year ago that altered my whole life. I had to begin living all over again…" Maxim's silence, Maxim's moods. The way he never talked about Rebecca. The way he never mentioned her name. Maxim's dislike of the cove, the stone cottage. "If you had my memories you would not go there either." The way he climbed the path through the woods not looking behind him. Maxim pacing up and down the library after Rebecca died. Up and down. Up and down. "I came away in rather a hurry," he said to Mrs Van Hopper, a line, thin as gossamer, between his brows. "They say he can't get over his wife's death." The fancy dress dance last night, and I coming down to the head of the stairs, in Rebecca's dress. "I killed Rebecca," Maxim had said. "I shot Rebecca in the cottage in the woods." And the diver had found her lying there, on the cabin floor…</div>

<div class="line_en">"I don't want to look back on those years," he said slowly. "I don't want even to tell you about them. The shame and the degradation. The lie we lived, she and I. The shabby, sordid farce we played together. Before friends, before relations, even before the servants, before faithful, trusting creatures like old Frith. They all believed in her down here, they all admired her, they never knew how she laughed at them behind their backs, jeered at them, mimicked them. I can remember days when the place was full for some show or other, a garden party, a pageant, and she walked about with a smile like an angel on her face, her arm through mine, giving prizes afterwards to a little troop of children; and then the day afterwards she would be up at dawn driving to London, streaking to that flat of hers by the river like an animal to its hole in the ditch, coming back here at the end of the week, after five unspeakable days. Oh, I kept to my side of the bargain all right. I never gave her away. Her blasted taste made Manderley the thing it is today. The gardens, the shrubs, even the azaleas in the Happy Valley; do you think they existed when my father was alive? God, the place was a wilderness; lovely, yes, wild and lonely with a beauty of its own, yes, but crying out for skill and care and the money that he would never give to it, that I would not have thought of giving to it -- but for Rebecca. Half the stuff you see here in the rooms was never here originally. The drawing-room as it is today, the morning-room -- that's all Rebecca. Those chairs that Frith points out so proudly to the visitors on the public day, and that panel of tapestry -- Rebecca again. Oh, some of the things were here admittedly, stored away in back rooms -- my father knew nothing about furniture or pictures -but the majority was bought by Rebecca. The beauty of Manderley that you see today, the Manderley that people talk about and photograph and paint, it's all due to her, to Rebecca."</div>

<div class="line_en">"And so we lived," he said, "month after month, year after year. I accepted everything -- because of Manderley. What she did in London did not touch me -- because it did not hurt Manderley. And she was careful those first years; there was never a murmur about her, never a whisper. Then little by little she began to grow careless. You know how a man starts drinking? He goes easy at first, just a little at a time, a bad bout perhaps every five months or so. And then the period between grows less and less. Soon it's every month, every fortnight, every few days. There's no margin of safety left and all his secret cunning goes. It was like that with Rebecca. She began to ask her friends down here. She would have one or two of them and mix them up at a weekend party so that at first I was not quite sure, not quite certain. She would have picnics down at her cottage in the cove. I came back once, having been away shooting in Scotland, and found her there, with half a dozen of them; people I had never seen before. I warned her, and she shrugged her shoulders. 'What the hell's it got to do with you?' she said. I told her she could see her friends in London, but Manderley was mine. She must stick to that part of the bargain. She smiled, she did not say anything. Then she started on Frank, poor shy faithful Frank. He came to me one day and said he wanted to leave Manderley and take another job. We argued for two hours, here in the library, and then I understood. He broke down and told me. She never left him alone, he said, she was always going down to his house, trying to get him to the cottage. Dear, wretched Frank, who had not understood, who had always thought we were the normal happy married couple we pretended to be.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I accused Rebecca of this, and she flared up at once, cursing me, using every filthy word in her particular vocabulary. We had a sickening, loathsome scene. She went up to London after that and stayed there for a month. When she came back again she was quiet at first; I thought she had learnt her lesson. Bee and Giles came for a weekend, and I realized then what I had sometimes suspected before, that Bee did not like Rebecca. I believe, in her funny abrupt, downright way she saw through her, guessed something was wrong. It was a tricky, nervy sort of weekend. Giles went out sailing with Rebecca, Bee and I lazed on the lawn. And when they came back I could tell by Giles's rather hearty jovial manner and by a look in Rebecca's eye that she had started on him, as she had done on Frank. I saw Bee watching Giles at dinner, who laughed louder than usual, talked a little too much. And all the while Rebecca sitting there at the head of the table, looking like an angel."</div>

<div class="line_en">They were all fitting into place, the jig-saw pieces. The odd strained shapes that I had tried to piece together with my fumbling fingers and they had never fitted. Frank's odd manner when I spoke about Rebecca. Beatrice, and her rather diffident negative attitude. The silence that I had always taken for sympathy and regret was a silence born of shame and embarrassment. It seemed incredible to me now that I had never understood. I wondered how many people there were in the world who suffered, and continued to suffer, because they could not break out from their own web of shyness and reserve, and in their blindness and folly built up a great distorted wall in front of them that hid the truth. This was what I had done. I had built up false pictures in my mind and sat before them. I had never had the courage to demand the truth.

Then she would spend the night down there with him. Once again I warned her. I said if I found him here, anywhere on the estate, I'd shoot him. He had a black, filthy record… The very thought of him walking about the woods in Manderley, in places like the Happy Valley, made me mad. I told her I would not stand for it. She shrugged her shoulders. She forgot to blaspheme. And I noticed she was looking paler than usual, nervy, rather haggard. I wondered then what the hell would happen to her when she began to look old, feel old. Things drifted on. Nothing very much happened. Then one day she went up to London, and came back again the same day, which she did not do as a rule. I did not expect her. I dined that night with Frank at his house, we had a lot of work on at the time."</div>

The thing had got to be settled, one way or the other. I thought I'd take a gun and frighten the fellow, frighten them both. I went down right away to the cottage. The servants never knew I had come back to the house at all. I slipped out into the garden and through the woods. I saw the light in the cottage window, and I went straight in.

<div class="line_en">"And I thought of the tide, how swift it ran and strong into the little cove. The wind blew down from the headland like a funnel. I got the boat out into the bay. I got her out there, beyond the beacon, and I tried to go about, to clear the ridge of rocks. The little jib fluttered. I could not sheet it in. A puff of wind came and the sheet tore out of my hands, went twisting round the mast. The sail thundered and shook. It cracked like a whip above my head. I could not remember what one had to do. I could not remember. I tried to reach that sheet and it blew above me in the air. Another blast of wind came straight ahead. We began to drift sideways, closer to the ridge. It was dark, so damned dark I couldn't see anything on the black, slippery deck. Somehow I blundered down into the cabin. I had a spike with me. If I didn't do it now it would be too late. We were getting so near to the ridge, and in six or seven minutes, drifting like this, we should be out of deep water. I opened the seacocks. The water began to come in. I drove the spike into the bottom boards. One of the planks split right across. I took the spike out and began to drive in another plank. The water came up over my feet. I left Rebecca lying on the floor. I fastened both the scuttles. I bolted the door. When I came up on deck I saw we were within twenty yards of the ridge. I threw some of the loose stuff on the deck into the water. There was a lifebuoy, a pair of sweeps, a coil of rope. I climbed into the dinghy. I pulled away, and lay back on the paddles, and watched. The boat was drifting still. She was sinking too. Sinking by the head. The jib was still shaking and cracking like a whip. I thought someone must hear it, someone walking the cliffs late at night, some fisherman from Kerrith away beyond me in the bay, whose boat I could not see. The boat was smaller, like a black shadow on the water. The mast began to shiver, began to crack. Suddenly she heeled right over and as she went the mast broke in two, split right down the centre. The lifebuoy and the sweeps floated away from me on the water. The boat was not there any more. I remember staring at the place where she had been. Then I pulled back to the cove. It started raining."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我还考虑到潮水的因素，那晚的潮水既急又猛，汹涌冲进小海湾。风像是通过漏斗从海岬处吹下。我驾着帆船驶过灯塔，进了海湾。我绕着圈子航行，避开那突出的礁岩。船首的小三角帆在风中啪啪作响，我怎么也没法扣紧帆脚索把它张满。一阵狂风吹来，猛地把帆脚索从我手里打落，那绳索马上绕着桅杆卷作一团。帆颤抖着发出巨大的劈啪声。像是有谁在我头顶挥舞鞭子。我记不得在这种场合驾船人应该如何动作才对，我当时什么都记不得了。我曾伸手去抓那根帆脚索，可绳索在我头上随风飘荡。这时迎面又吹来一阵大风，帆船开始向一侧漂去，接近礁岩。天暗极了。在那漆黑而滑溜的甲板上，真是伸手不见五指。我好不容易才跌跌撞撞下到舱里，手里拿着一块大尖铁。要是此刻再不采取行动，就太晚了，因为帆船离礁岩已很近，如果再漂流六七分钟，就会离开深水。我旋开船壳上的海底阀门，海水顿时涌进来；我用大尖铁猛击船底木板，其中一块马上裂作两半；我把大尖铁从缺口处退出，又去猛击另一块底板。海水漫上我的脚面。我让吕蓓卡的尸体留在那儿的地板上，接着就去把两扇舷窗—一关紧，又把舱门锁上。待我走上甲板，我发现船离礁岩已不满二十码。我把甲板上的零碎东西扔下海去——一个救生圈、一对长柄桨、一团绳子。我爬进橡皮筏子，划离帆船，接着又停住桨，回头凝望。帆船仍在随风漂流，同时又正歪着头逐渐下沉。三角帆还是颤抖不已，打响鞭似地劈啪作声。我想深夜里倘若有人在悬崖上行走，定会听到这劈啪的帆声。也许海湾远处有从克里斯港来的渔人，他的小渔船浮在水面像个幽灵，我没法看清。帆船的桅杆开始摇晃，并出现裂缝。突然，船翻了。与此同时，桅杆拦腰折断。救生圈和长柄桨从我身旁荡开去，帆船却不见了。我记得自己当时曾对着帆船原先的位置呆呆看了好一会儿，然后才划着桨回到小海湾。这时开始下雨了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"That's all," he said, "there's no more to tell. I left the dinghy on the buoy, as she would have done. I went back and looked at the cottage. The floor was wet with the salt water. She might have done it herself. I walked up the path through the woods. I went into the house. Up the stairs to the dressing-room. I remember undressing. It began to blow and rain very hard. I was sitting there, on the bed, when Mrs Danvers knocked on the door. I went and opened it, in my dressing-gown, and spoke to her. She was worried about Rebecca. I told her to go back to bed. I shut the door again. I went back and sat by the window in my dressing-gown, watching the rain, listening to the sea as it broke there, in the cove."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这就是全部经过，”他说。“都说完了。我把筏子拴在浮筒上。反正换了她一定也会这么干。我回到小屋一看，地板被海水冲得湿漉漉的，那也可能是她本人打扫屋子时洒的水。我沿着小径穿过林子，走回屋来，上了楼梯，来到更衣室。我还记得自己如何脱衣就寝。屋外风雨凄苦，其势越来越猛。丹弗斯太太来敲门时，我正坐在床上。我穿着晨衣，走去开门，同她说了几句话。她担心吕蓓卡出什么意外；我劝她回去睡觉。我把门关上，走回房间，穿着晨衣在窗口坐下，看黑夜里的倾盆大雨，听海湾里的阵阵涛声。”">查看中文翻译</div>
