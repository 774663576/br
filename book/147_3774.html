<div class="line_en">It was apparent, however, that Steve was lacking in scholarship. When he was fourteen, he was summoned by the school principal to his little office, to take a thrashing for truancy and insubordination. But the spirit of acquiescence was not in him: he snatched the rod from the man's hand, broke it, smote him solidly in the eye, and dropped gleefully eighteen feet to the ground.</div>

<div class="line_en">Gant was now head of a numerous family, which rose ladderwise from infancy to the adolescent Steve -- who was eighteen -- and the maidenly Daisy. She was seventeen and in her last year at high school. She was a timid, sensitive girl, looking like her name -- Daisy-ish industrious and thorough in her studies: her teachers thought her one of the best students they had ever known. She had very little fire, or denial in her; she responded dutifully to instructions; she gave back what had been given to her. She played the piano without any passionate feeling for the music; but she rendered it honestly with a beautiful rippling touch. And she practised hours at a time.</div>

<div class="line_en">Of them all, he had had very much the worst of it. Since his childhood he had been the witness of his father's wildest debauches. He had not forgotten. Also, as the oldest, he was left to shift for himself while Eliza's attention focussed on her younger children. She was feeding Eugene at her breast long after Steve had taken his first two dollars to the ladies of Eagle Crescent.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在兄弟姊妹几个孩子中，史蒂夫受到的照顾最少。当他还很小的时候，就亲眼见证了父亲的堕落行为。他并没有把这些都忘掉。同时，由于母亲伊丽莎把主要的精力全放在年龄更小的孩子们身上了，他作为长子，也就被忽视了。当尤金还在伊丽莎怀里吃奶的时候，史蒂夫早已拿了两元钱跑到鹰环那里玩女人去了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This was one of the best things he ever did: his conduct in other directions was less fortunate. Very early, as his truancy mounted, and after he had been expelled, and as his life hardened rapidly in a defiant viciousness, the antagonism between the boy and Gant grew open and bitter. Gant recognized perhaps most of his son's vices as his own: there was little, however, of his redeeming quality. Steve had a piece of tough suet where his heart should have been.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是他一生中干过的最辉煌的一件事了，在其他方面的表现可没有这么神气。他很早就因为逃学次数过多而被学校开除了。后来，他的性格变得特别倔强而凶恶。他和甘特之间的仇恨也越来越深。也许甘特清楚儿子身上的诸多不良习性都和他自己有一定的关系，但是他自己的优点，儿子学到得太少。史蒂夫性情粗暴、缺乏人情味。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was inwardly sore at the abuse Gant heaped on him; he was not insensitive to his faults, but to be called a "good-for-nothing bum," "a worthless degenerate," "a pool-room loafer," hardened his outward manner of swagger defiance. Cheaply and flashily dressed, with peg-top yellow shoes, flaring striped trousers, and a broad-brimmed straw hat with a colored band, he would walk down the avenue with a preposterous lurch, and a smile of strained assurance on his face, saluting with servile cordiality all who would notice him. And if a man of property greeted him, his lacerated but overgrown vanity would seize the crumb, and he would boast pitifully at home: "They all know Little Stevie! He's got the respect of all the big men in this town, all right, all right! Every one has a good word for Little Stevie except his own people. Do you know what J. T. Collins said to me today?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="甘特不断的辱骂令他非常难受。他对自己所犯的错误并不是漠不关心，只是由于成天被骂成“没用的混账”“叫花子”“没出息的浪子”，到头来他只得硬着头皮用蔑视的态度来应对这一切。他身上穿着花哨廉价的衣服、惹人注意的条纹裤子，脚穿一双尖头的黄皮鞋，头上的宽边草帽还缀上一条颜色鲜艳的带子。他走在大街上的时候，常会摆出一副滑稽可笑的样子。如果有人注意到他，他的脸上就会表现出紧张而自信的表情，同时还谦恭、郑重地向对方敬礼示意。如果哪个有钱人同他打了招呼，他原本受伤但却畸形的虚荣心就会促使他充分利用这个机会，回到家便会大肆乱吹：“别人都认识小史蒂夫！全城所有的大人物都尊重他。哼，哼！除了他自家的人以外，人人都夸小史蒂夫。你想知道J.T。科林斯今天跟我说什么了吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Gant, in a fury, gave him a hard beating when he had been expelled from school. He had never forgotten. Finally, he was told to go to work and support himself: he found desultory employment as a soda-jerker, or as delivery boy for a morning paper. Once, with a crony, Gus Moody, son of a foundry-man, he had gone off to see the world. Grimy from vagabondage they had crawled off a freight-train at Knoxville, Tennessee, spent their little money on food, and in a brothel, and returned, two days later, coal-black but boastful of their exploit.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当年被学校开除的时候，他被甘特狠狠地揍了一顿。而他从来没有忘记过那件事。后来，父母只好让他自谋生路。他断断续续地卖过汽水，做过早报的报童。有一次，他和小伙伴——铸造工的儿子葛斯·穆迪两个人外出去周游世界。他们扒上了一列货车，然后在田纳西州的诺克斯维尔下了车，结果弄得浑身污秽肮脏。他们口袋里的那点儿钱全都买了吃的，最后还逛了一次妓院。等两天后跑回家的时候，两个人浑身脏得像煤球，还到处吹嘘他们的探险经历呢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'll vow," Eliza fretted, "I don't know what's to become of that boy." It was the tragic flaw of her temperament to get to the vital point too late: she pursed her lips thoughtfully, wandered off in another direction, and wept when misfortune came. She always waited. Moreover, in her deepest heart, she had an affection for her oldest son, which, if it was not greater, was at least different in kind from what she bore for the others. His glib boastfulness, his pitiable brag, pleased her: they were to her indications of his "smartness," and she often infuriated her two studious girls by praising them. Thus, looking at a specimen of his handwriting, she would say:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我的老天哪，”伊丽莎发愁地说，“我真不知道这个孩子以后会变成什么样。”这就是她的一个非常可悲的缺点，她往往等事情难以挽回的时候，才会找到其关键：她会若有所思地噘着嘴，把话题岔开，等到不幸真正到来的时候，她只知道哭泣。她总在等待着什么。而且，在她内心深处，她对大儿子怀着一种非常特殊的情感，这种感情即使不是最深，至少也与别的孩子有所不同。她喜欢他的油腔滑调、自吹自擂、可怜的自大模样。在她的眼里，这全都是“聪明”的表现。她经常在两个勤奋的女儿面前夸奖他，使她们大为恼火。比如，她一边看着他写的字，一边赞不绝口：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One day, Steve forged a check on his father. It was some days before Gant discovered it: the amount was only three dollars, but his anger was bitter. In a pronouncement at home, delivered loudly enough to publish the boy's offense to the neighborhood, he spoke of the penitentiary, of letting him go to jail, of being disgraced in his old age -- a period of his life at which he had not yet arrived, but which he used to his advantage in times of strife.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="还有一次，史蒂夫模仿父亲的笔迹签了张支票。甘特过了一段日子后才发现这事儿，钱倒不多，只有三块钱，但是甘特气得不得了。他在家里大声地训斥起来，声音大得足以让街坊邻居们都能听见。他最后甚至还提到了监狱，说要送他去坐牢，说他的行为完全是给他的老脸上抹黑——虽然他还没有多老，但是每次争吵中他都会别有用意地提到这个字眼。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="史蒂夫小时候常跟在父亲的身后听候差遣，加上父亲长期嗜酒，他也早早地尝到了美酒的滋味。当年他就偷偷地吞下过半瓶的威士忌，那次经历给他提供了向同伴们大肆吹嘘的好资料。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He paid the check, of course, but another name -- that of "forger"-- was added to the vocabulary of his abuse.

<div class="line_en">Gant drank less: save for a terrifying spree every six or eight weeks, which bound them all in fear for two or three days, Eliza had little to complain of on this score. But her enormous patience was wearing very thin because of the daily cycle of abuse. They slept now in separate rooms upstairs: he rose at six or six-thirty, dressed and went down to build the fires. As he kindled a blaze in the range, and a roaring fire in the sitting-room, he muttered constantly to himself, with an occasional oratorical rise and fall of his voice. In this way he composed and polished the flood of his invective: when the demands of fluency and emphasis had been satisfied he would appear suddenly before her in the kitchen, and deliver himself without preliminary, as the grocer's negro entered with pork chops or a thick steak:</div>

<div class="line_en">Sometimes, lying on a sunny quilt, Eugene grew conscious of a gentle peering face, a soft caressing voice, unlike any of the others in kind and quality, a tender olive skin, black hair, sloeblack eyes, exquisite, rather sad, kindliness. He nuzzled his soft face next to Eugene's, fondled and embraced him. On his brown neck he was birth-marked with a raspberry: Eugene touched it again and again with wonder. This was Grover -- the gentlest and saddest of the boys.</div>

<div class="line_en">The boys worked on the Fair Grounds. They were call-boys at a place called the Inside Inn. The name charmed him: it flashed constantly through his brain. Sometimes his sisters, sometimes Eliza, sometimes the boys pulled him through the milling jungle of noise and figures, past the rich opulence and variety of the life of the Fair. He was drugged in fantasy as they passed the East India tea-house, and as he saw tall turbaned men who walked about within and caught for the first time, so that he never forgot, the slow incense of the East. Once in a huge building roaring with sound, he was rooted before a mighty locomotive, the greatest monster he had ever seen, whose wheels spun terrifically in grooves, whose blazing furnaces, raining hot red coals into the pit beneath, were fed incessantly by two grimed fire-painted stokers. The scene burned in his brain like some huge splendor out of Hell: he was appalled and fascinated by it.</div>

<div class="line_en">Once Daisy, yielding to the furtive cat-cruelty below her mild placidity, took him with her through the insane horrors of the scenic railway; they plunged bottomlessly from light into roaring blackness, and as his first yell ceased with a slackening of the car, rolled gently into a monstrous lighted gloom peopled with huge painted grotesques, the red maws of fiendish heads, the cunning appearances of death, nightmare, and madness. His unprepared mind was unrooted by insane fear: the car rolled downward from one lighted cavern to another, and as his heart withered to a pea, he heard from the people about him loud gusty laughter, in which his sister joined. His mind, just emerging from the unreal wilderness of childish fancy, gave way completely in this Fair, and he was paralyzed by the conviction, which often returned to him in later years, that his life was a fabulous nightmare and that, by cunning and conspirate artifice, he had surrendered all his hope, belief, and confidence to the lewd torture of demons masked in human flesh. Half-sensible, and purple with gasping terror, he came out finally into the warm and practical sunlight.</div>

<div class="line_en">He wondered what a cooling board was; the house was full of menace. She bore him out into the dimly lighted hall, and carried him to the rooms at the front of the house. Behind the door he heard low voices. Quietly she opened it; the light blazed brightly on the bed. Eugene looked, horror swarmed like poison through his blood. Behind the little wasted shell that lay there he remembered suddenly the warm brown face, the soft eyes, that once had peered down at him: like one who has been mad, and suddenly recovers reason, he remembered that forgotten face he had not seen in weeks, that strange bright loneliness that would not return.
