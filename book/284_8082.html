<div class="line_en">It was true, too. She had a little thin face and a little thin body, thin light hair and a sour expression. Her hair was yellow, and her face was yellow because she had been born in India and had always been ill in one way or another.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="确实是这样。她的脸蛋瘦削，身材单薄，头发细薄，一脸不高兴。她的头发是黄色的，脸色也是黄的，因为她在印度出生，不是生这病就是得那病。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She had not wanted a little girl at all, and when Mary was born she handed her over to the care of an Ayah, who was made to understand that if she wished to please the Mem Sahib, she must keep the child out of sight as much as possible.</div>

<div class="line_en">She never remembered seeing familiarly anything but the dark faces of her Ayah and the other native servants, and as they always obeyed her and gave her her own way in everything, because the Mem Sahib would be angry if she was disturbed by her crying, by the time she was six years old she was as tyrannical and selfish a little pig as ever lived.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她从不记得见过任何熟悉的东西，除了印度奶妈和其他印度仆人的黑脸，他们总是服从她，让她随心所欲，因为女主人被她的哭声打扰的话会发怒。到她六岁的时候，她是世界上最自私、最专横的小猪崽。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The young English governess who came to teach her to read and write disliked her so much that she gave up her place in three months, and when other governesses came to try to fill it they always went away in a shorter time than the first one.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was something mysterious in the air that morning. Nothing was done in its regular order and several of the native servants seemed missing, while those whom Mary saw slunk or hurried about with ashy and scared faces. But no one would tell her anything and her Ayah did not come. She was actually left alone as the morning went on, and at last she wandered out into the garden and began to play by herself under a tree near the veranda. She pretended that she was making a flower-bed, and she stuck big scarlet hibiscus blossoms into little heaps of earth, all the time growing more and more angry and muttering to herself the things she would say and the names she would call Saidie when she returned.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天早晨的气氛有些神秘。没有一件事是按常规办的，几个土著仆人不见了，玛丽见到的仆人们都面如死灰，不是开溜，就是四处乱窜。可是没有人告诉她任何事情，她的奶妈没有来。那天早晨，慢慢只剩她自己了，最后她漫步来到花园里，在游廊旁边的一棵树下自己和自己玩。她假装在造花坛，把一朵朵深红的木槿花插进一个个小土堆里，心里越来越生气，自言自语嘟哝着奶妈回来时要骂她的话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She was grinding her teeth and saying this over and over again when she heard her mother come out on the veranda with some one. She was with a fair young man and they stood talking together in low strange voices. Mary knew the fair young man who looked like a boy. She had heard that he was a very young officer who had just come from England. The child stared at him, but she stared most at her mother. She always did this when she had a chance to see her, because the Mem Sahib -- Mary used to call her that oftener than anything else was such a tall, slim, pretty person and wore such lovely clothes. Her hair was like curly silk and she had a delicate little nose which seemed to be disdaining things, and she had large laughing eyes. All her clothes were thin and floating, and Mary said they were "full of lace." They looked fuller of lace than ever this morning, but her eyes were not laughing at all. They were large and scared and lifted imploringly to the fair boy officer's face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她正咬牙切齿地反复骂着，听到她妈妈和人一起来到游廊上。她和一个漂亮小伙子一起，他们站在一起低声谈话，声音奇怪。玛丽认识这个年轻人，他长得像个小男孩。她听说过他是个年轻军官，刚刚从英国来。小女孩瞪着他看，不过更瞪着她母亲看。一有机会见到她母亲，她就这样，因为女主人——玛丽对她最常用的称呼——是如此高挑、苗条，穿着如此美丽的衣服。她的头发如同卷曲的丝缎，小巧玲珑的鼻子好像对任何东西都瞧不起，她的大眼睛像在笑。她所有的衣服都轻薄飘逸，玛丽说它们“满是花边”。这天早晨，它们的花边好像比任何时候都更满。大大的花边害怕得张开，高耸到年轻军官的脸上，哀求着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">During the confusion and bewilderment of the second day Mary hid herself in the nursery and was forgotten by everyone. Nobody thought of her, nobody wanted her, and strange things happened of which she knew nothing. Mary alternately cried and slept through the hours. She only knew that people were ill and that she heard mysterious and tightening sounds. Once she crept into the dining-room and found it empty, though a partly finished meal was on the table and chairs and plates looked as if they had been hastily pushed back when the diners rose suddenly for some reason. The child ate some fruit and biscuits, and being thirsty she drank a glass of wine which stood nearly filled. It was sweet, and she did not know how strong it was. Very soon it made her intensely drowsy, and she went back to her nursery and shut herself in again, frightened by cries she heard in the huts and by the hurrying sound of feet. The wine made her so sleepy that she could scarcely keep her eyes open and she lay down on her bed and knew nothing more for a long time.</div>

<div class="line_en">When she awakened she lay and stared at the wall. The house was perfectly still. She had never known it to be so silent before. She heard neither voices nor footsteps, and wondered if everybody had got well of the cholera and all the trouble was over. She wondered also who would take care of her now her Ayah was dead. There would be a new Ayah, and perhaps she would know some new stories. Mary had been rather tired of the old ones. She did not cry because her nurse had died. She was not an affectionate child and had never cared much for any one. The noise and hurrying about and wailing over the cholera had frightened her, and she had been angry because no one seemed to remember that she was alive. Everyone was too panic-stricken to think of a little girl no one was fond of. When people had the cholera it seemed that they remembered nothing but themselves. But if everyone had got well again, surely some one would remember and come to look for her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她醒来以后，躺在床上盯着墙看。房子里一片寂静。她从没听到这座房子这么安静。她听不到说话声，也听不到脚步声，她猜想着大家是不是都从霍乱里恢复过来了，所有的麻烦都结束了。她也猜想着，她的奶妈死了，现在谁会来照顾她呢？会来一个新奶妈，也许能讲新故事。那些旧故事玛丽已经非常厌倦了。她不是个有人情味的小孩，也从来没关心过谁。霍乱带来的各种嘈杂、忙乱和嚎哭把她吓坏了，她非常生气，因为看来没有任何人记起来她还活着。恐慌击垮了每一个人，没有人有工夫去想起一个“万人嫌”。霍乱来的时候，人们似乎什么都记不起，除了他们自己。不过，如果大家都好起来了，肯定会有人记起，然后来找她。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But no one came, and as she lay waiting the house seemed to grow more and more silent. She heard something rustling on the matting and when she looked down she saw a little snake gliding along and watching her with eyes like jewels. She was not frightened, because he was a harmless little thing who would not hurt her and he seemed in a hurry to get out of the room. He slipped under the door as she watched him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是没有人来，她躺着等待，房子好像变得越来越安静。她听到地毯上窸窸窣窣地响，她低头看到一条小蛇爬过，看着她，眼睛如同宝石。她不觉得害怕，因为它是个与人无害的小东西，正急于离开这个房间。她看着它溜过门缝。">查看中文翻译</div>

No one went to meet or speak to them and they seemed to open doors and look into rooms. "What desolation!"she heard one voice say. "That pretty, pretty woman! I suppose the child, too. I heard there was a child, though no one ever saw her."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="差不多一分钟之内，她就听见院子里响起脚步声，然后到了游廊上。是男人们的脚步声，他们进了房子，低声说话。没有人去接待他们，跟他们讲话，他们好像打开门，朝一个个房间里看。“一片废墟！”她听见一个声音说。“那么一个美人啊！我猜那个孩子也…我听说有个孩子，不过从来没人见过她。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mary was standing in the middle of the nursery when they opened the door a few minutes later. She looked an ugly, cross little thing and was frowning because she was beginning to be hungry and feel disgracefully neglected.
