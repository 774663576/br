<div class="line_en">Miss Churchill, however, being of age, and with the full command of her fortune -- though her fortune bore no proportion to the family-estate -- was not to be dissuaded from the marriage, and it took place, to the infinite mortification of Mr. and Mrs. Churchill, who threw her off with due decorum. It was an unsuitable connexion, and did not produce much happiness. Mrs. Weston ought to have found more in it, for she had a husband whose warm heart and sweet temper made him think every thing due to her in return for the great goodness of being in love with him; but though she had one sort of spirit, she had not the best. She had resolution enough to pursue her own will in spite of her brother, but not enough to refrain from unreasonable regrets at that brother's unreasonable anger, nor from missing the luxuries of her former home. They lived beyond their income, but still it was nothing in comparison of Enscombe: she did not cease to love her husband, but she wanted at once to be the wife of Captain Weston, and Miss Churchill of Enscombe.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr. Weston was a native of Highbury, and born of a respectable family, which for the last two or three generations had been rising into gentility and property. He had received a good education, but, on succeeding early in life to a small independence, had become indisposed for any of the more homely pursuits in which his brothers were engaged, and had satisfied an active, cheerful mind and social temper by entering into the militia of his county, then embodied.</div>

<div class="line_en">Captain Weston was a general favourite; and when the chances of his military life had introduced him to Miss Churchill, of a great Yorkshire family, and Miss Churchill fell in love with him, nobody was surprized, except her brother and his wife, who had never seen him, and who were full of pride and importance, which the connexion would offend.</div>

<div class="line_en">Captain Weston, who had been considered, especially by the Churchills, as making such an amazing match, was proved to have much the worst of the bargain; for when his wife died, after a three years' marriage, he was rather a poorer man than at first, and with a child to maintain. From the expense of the child, however, he was soon relieved. The boy had, with the additional softening claim of a lingering illness of his mother's, been the means of a sort of reconciliation; and Mr. and Mrs. Churchill, having no children of their own, nor any other young creature of equal kindred to care for, offered to take the whole charge of the little Frank soon after her decease. Some scruples and some reluctance the widower-father may be supposed to have felt; but as they were overcome by other considerations, the child was given up to the care and the wealth of the Churchills, and he had only his own comfort to seek, and his own situation to improve as he could.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在别人看来，特别是在邱吉尔夫妇看来，韦斯顿上尉高攀了一门贵亲，可事实上他却倒了大霉。他结婚三年后妻子就死了，这时他不仅比结婚前来得更穷，而且还要抚养一个孩子。不过，没过多久，孩子的花销就不用他承担了。原来，这孩子以及那久病不起的母亲太让人可怜，倒成了促成和解的媒介。邱吉尔夫妇没有自己的孩子，也没有别的近亲的孩子可供他们收养。所以，孩子的母亲死后不久，他们就提出要收养小弗兰克。可以料想，那丧偶的父亲心里有些顾虑，有些踌躇。不过，往别的方面一考虑，他又打消了顾虑和踌躇，把孩子交给了邱吉尔夫妇，让他跟着他们享福去，而他只需要寻求自己的安逸，尽可能改善自己的境况。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A complete change of life became desirable. He quitted the militia and engaged in trade, having brothers already established in a good way in London, which afforded him a favourable opening. It was a concern which brought just employment enough. He had still a small house in Highbury, where most of his leisure days were spent; and between useful occupation and the pleasures of society, the next eighteen or twenty years of his life passed cheerfully away. He had, by that time, realised an easy competence -- enough to secure the purchase of a little estate adjoining Highbury, which he had always longed for -- enough to marry a woman as portionless even as Miss Taylor, and to live according to the wishes of his own friendly and social disposition.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="以前的生活需要来个彻底的改变。他退出民兵团，做起生意来，由于几个哥哥在伦敦干得挺红火，也就给他提供了个好机会。那是一个小商行，刚好有足够的事情让他干。他在海伯里还有一栋小房子，闲暇时间大多在这里度过。随后的十八年、二十年中，他一边做点有益的事情，一边享受交友的乐趣，过得倒也挺快活。后来，日子过得充裕了，他本来早就想在海伯里附近买一小宗家业，现在终于有钱置办了，也有钱娶一个像泰勒小姐这样没有陪嫁的女人，并且按照自己和易近人、喜欢交际的性情，过着称心如意的生活。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was now some time since Miss Taylor had begun to influence his schemes; but as it was not the tyrannic influence of youth on youth, it had not shaken his determination of never settling till he could purchase Randalls, and the sale of Randalls was long looked forward to; but he had gone steadily on, with these objects in view, till they were accomplished. He had made his fortune, bought his house, and obtained his wife; and was beginning a new period of existence, with every probability of greater happiness than in any yet passed through. He had never been an unhappy man; his own temper had secured him from that, even in his first marriage; but his second must shew him how delightful a well-judging and truly amiable woman could be, and must give him the pleasantest proof of its being a great deal better to choose than to be chosen, to excite gratitude than to feel it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他打泰勒小姐的主意不是一两天的事了，但毕竟不像年轻人相爱那样急不可耐，本来早就想要买下兰多尔斯，决心买下兰多尔斯再成家，后来坠人情网也没动摇这个决心。他抱着这些目标，稳打稳扎，终于一个个实现了。他发了财，买了房子，娶了太太，开始了新的生活，大有可能比以往任何时候过得都快活。他从来没有郁郁不乐过，这是他的性情决定的，即使第一次结婚时也是如此。然而，这第二次结婚必将使他体会到，娶一个明白事理、和蔼可亲的女人该是多么喜幸，并能使他极其惬意地认识到，挑选别人要比被人挑选好得多，让人感激要比感激别人好得多。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He had only himself to please in his choice: his fortune was his own; for as to Frank, it was more than being tacitly brought up as his uncle's heir, it had become so avowed an adoption as to have him assume the name of Churchill on coming of age. It was most unlikely, therefore, that he should ever want his father's assistance. His father had no apprehension of it. The aunt was a capricious woman, and governed her husband entirely; but it was not in Mr. Weston's nature to imagine that any caprice could be strong enough to affect one so dear, and, as he believed, so deservedly dear. He saw his son every year in London, and was proud of him; and his fond report of him as a very fine young man had made Highbury feel a sort of pride in him too. He was looked on as sufficiently belonging to the place to make his merits and prospects a kind of common concern.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他完全根据自己的意愿作出这样的抉择。他的财产是属于他自己的，至于弗兰克，他被舅舅当做继承人收养，并不仅仅是一种默契，而是双方有言在先，等他成年时，就改姓邱吉尔。因此，弗兰克不大可能求助于他父亲，他父亲也不担心这一点。弗兰克的舅妈是个任性的女人，丈夫完全受她摆布。但是，韦斯顿先生并不相信她的任性会有那么大的威力，居然能左右这么可爱的一个人，而且他认为也是值得大家喜爱的一个人。他每年都能在伦敦看见自己的儿子，很为他感到骄傲。他夸赞他是个出类拔萃的青年，以至于海伯里的人也有些为他感到骄傲。大家把他看成当地人，他身上的优点和未来的前程，都受到众人的关注。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Now, upon his father's marriage, it was very generally proposed, as a most proper attention, that the visit should take place. There was not a dissentient voice on the subject, either when Mrs. Perry drank tea with Mrs. and Miss Bates, or when Mrs. and Miss Bates returned the visit. Now was the time for Mr. Frank Churchill to come among them; and the hope strengthened when it was understood that he had written to his new mother on the occasion. For a few days, every morning visit in Highbury included some mention of the handsome letter Mrs. Weston had received. `I suppose you have heard of the handsome letter Mr. Frank Churchill has written to Mrs. Weston? I understand it was a very handsome letter, indeed. Mr. Woodhouse told me of it. Mr. Woodhouse saw the letter, and he says he never saw such a handsome letter in his life.'</div>

And then there was such comfort in the very easy distance of Randalls from Hartfield, so convenient for even solitary female walking, and in Mr. Weston's disposition and circumstances, which would make the approaching season no hindrance to their spending half the evenings in the week together.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was, indeed, a highly prized letter. Mrs. Weston had, of course, formed a very favourable idea of the young man; and such a pleasing attention was an irresistible proof of his great good sense, and a most welcome addition to every source and every expression of congratulation which her marriage had already secured. She felt herself a most fortunate woman; and she had lived long enough to know how fortunate she might well be thought, where the only regret was for a partial separation from friends whose friendship for her had never cooled, and who could ill bear to part with her.</div>

<div class="line_en">Her situation was altogether the subject of hours of gratitude to Mrs. Weston, and of moments only of regret; and her satisfaction -- -her more than satisfaction -- her cheerful enjoyment, was so just and so apparent, that Emma, well as she knew her father, was sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity ``poor Miss Taylor,'' when they left her at Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort, or saw her go away in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own. But never did she go without Mr. Woodhouse's giving a gentle sigh, and saying, `Ah, poor Miss Taylor! She would be very glad to stay.'</div>

<div class="line_en">There was no recovering Miss Taylor -- nor much likelihood of ceasing to pity her; but a few weeks brought some alleviation to Mr. Woodhouse. The compliments of his neighbours were over; he was no longer teased by being wished joy of so sorrowful an event; and the wedding-cake, which had been a great distress to him, was all eat up. His own stomach could bear nothing rich, and he could never believe other people to be different from himself. What was unwholesome to him he regarded as unfit for any body; and he had, therefore, earnestly tried to dissuade them from having any wedding-cake at all, and when that proved vain, as earnestly tried to prevent any body's eating it. He had been at the pains of consulting Mr. Perry, the apothecary, on the subject. Mr. Perry was an intelligent, gentlemanlike man, whose frequent visits were one of the comforts of Mr. Woodhouse's life; and upon being applied to, he could not but acknowledge (though it seemed rather against the bias of inclination) that wedding-cake might certainly disagree with many -- perhaps with most people, unless taken moderately. With such an opinion, in confirmation of his own, Mr. Woodhouse hoped to influence every visitor of the newly married pair; but still the cake was eaten; and there was no rest for his benevolent nerves till it was all gone.</div>
