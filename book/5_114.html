<div class="line_en">Tully remembered the years by the stories she covered. In 2002, she vacationed in Europe, St. Barts, and Thailand. She went to the Oscars, won an Emmy, graced the cover of People magazine, and redecorated her apartment, but none of that stayed with her. What she remembered were the stories. She'd covered the launch of Operation Anaconda against the Taliban, the escalating violence in the region, the trial of Milosevic for crimes against humanity, and the start of the war against Iraq.</div>

<div class="line_en">By the spring of 2003, she was exhausted, worn down by the violence. When she finally returned home, it wasn't much better. Everywhere she went she was in a crowd, and nowhere did she feel more isolated than in a group of people who fawned over her, and sucked up to her, but didn't really know her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="2003年春天，她觉得精疲力竭，太多暴力让她心灵耗弱，即使回家也无法感到平静。无论走到哪里她都被人群包围，但她却更感孤寂，因为这些人奉承她、讨好她，却不是真正了解她。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Although no one who watched her on television would notice it, she was quietly coming undone. Grant hadn't called her in almost four months, and the last time they'd spoken before that it hadn't gone well.</div>

<div class="line_en">It shouldn't have surprised her. God knew she'd heard the same thing often enough in her life. She could even admit the truth of it. She did want more lately. She wanted a real life, not this perfect, glittery cotton candy one she'd created for herself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她不该感到错愕，天知道，这句话她一生中听过无数次，甚至连她自己也承认。最近她确实想得到更多，她想要真正的人生，而不是这个完美璀璨的棉花糖，尽管这是她为自己一手打造的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But she had no real idea how to go about starting over at her age. She loved her job too much to give it up; besides, she'd been famous and rich for so long that she couldn't imagine being ordinary again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她想从头来过，但又觉得自己一把年纪了，不知道该从何做起。她太热爱这份工作所以无法放弃，更何况，她长久以来一直享受着名声与财富，她无法想象重回平凡人生的日子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now, beneath a surprisingly warm sun, she walked down the busy streets of Manhattan, watching the fast-moving locals dodging between brightly dressed tourists. Today was the first sunny day after a long snowy winter, and nothing changed the mood of New York like the sun. People poured out of their boxy apartments, put on their walking shoes, and went outside. To her right, Central Park was a green oasis. For a moment, when she looked at it, she saw her own past: the Quad at UW; kids running around, throwing Frisbees, playing hacky sack. It had been twenty years since she'd left the campus for the last time. So much life had happened in those years, but right now it all felt as close as her own shadow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一天，阳光出奇温暖，她走在繁忙的曼哈顿街头，看着脚步飞快的当地人，闪过衣着鲜艳的观光客。经过大雪茫茫的漫长冬季，这是第一个放晴的日子，没有什么比阳光更能改变纽约的气氛，人们离开狭小的公寓，穿上舒适的鞋子出门。在她的右手边，中央公园有如青翠绿洲，她望着公园，一瞬间仿佛看见自己的过去：华盛顿大学的四方院，学生跑来跑去丢飞盘、踢沙包。她离开校园已经二十年了，虽然这些年她的人生发生许多变化，在这一刻往事却如影随形。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">What would she say to him after all these years? What would he say to her? The last time they'd been together he'd asked her to marry him; they'd never seen each other again. He'd known her so well then, enough that he hadn't stuck around to be told no. But they'd loved each other. With the wisdom of time and the passing of years, she knew that. She knew, too, that love didn't evaporate. It faded, perhaps, lost its weight like bones left out in the sun, but it didn't go away.</div>

<div class="line_en">She frowned up at him. They were standing so close that the merest move would be a kiss, but she couldn't imagine crossing that small distance. He looked younger than she remembered, more handsome. "How do you do that?" she whispered.</div>

<div class="line_en">As if from far away, Tully heard the girl's voice. She turned slowly around, saw two young women roller-skating toward them. She'd been wrong before; they were older than teenagers. One was the spitting image of Chad -- sharp features, black hair, eyes that crinkled when she smiled.</div>

<div class="line_en">Like a cancerous cell, the idea replicated in her mind and grew. She found herself thinking of Cloud, really thinking. She focused on the times her mother came back for her instead of the times she left. It was dangerous, Tully knew, to hang on to the positive when so much negative existed, and yet, she wondered suddenly if that had been her mistake.

<div class="line_en">Tully smiled. She hadn't thought about that summer in years. 1974. The beginning of it all. Meeting Kate had changed her life, and all because they'd dared to reach out for each other, dared to say, I want to be your friend.</div>

<div class="line_en">Now Tully stood in the driveway, listening to the car drive away, tires crunching on gravel. From beyond the house, in the backyard, she could hear waves washing onto the pea-gravel beach. That meant the tide was coming in. On this beautiful sunny early summer afternoon, the old-fashioned farmhouse looked like something out of a photo album of the Good Life. A fresh coat of stain made the shingles look like caramel and the white, glossy trim caught the sunlight and kept it. Flowers ran riot through the yard, creating bursts of color everywhere she looked. Toys and bikes lay scattered about, reminding her sharply of the old days, back when they'd been the Firefly Lane girls. Their bikes had been magic carpets to another world.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="塔莉站在车道上，听着礼车驶离时轮胎碾过砾石的声响，房屋后方传来潮水拍打碎石海滩的声音，那表示开始涨潮了。在这个美丽晴朗的初夏午后，这栋农庄风格的老式房屋有如家居杂志的照片，新染上的灰尘为屋瓦添上焦糖色调，闪亮的窗框反耀着骄阳，庭院中花朵恣意盛放，无论哪个方向都是一片万紫千红。地上散置着玩具与脚踏车，她深深缅怀起年少时光，当时她们被称为萤火虫巷姐妹花，脚踏车是通往另一个世界的魔毯。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She walked up the weed-veined concrete path to the front door. Even before she got to the stoop, she could hear the noise coming from within. It didn't surprise her. According to Kate, the first half of 2003 had been wild and crazy. Marah hadn't eased into the teen years; she'd lurched. And the boys had gone from loud, into-everything toddlers to louder, even more destructive five-year-olds. Every time Tully called, it seemed, Kate was driving someone somewhere.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她走上冒出杂草的水泥小径来到正门前，还没踏上门阶已经听到里面热闹的声响。那一点也不奇怪，凯蒂说过2003上半年非常狂乱忙碌，玛拉进入了青春期，但过程非常不顺；双胞胎学步时就已经吵闹又爱闯祸，现在他们五岁了，比以前更加吵闹、破坏力更强。每次塔莉打电话找凯蒂，她几乎永远在车上，忙着载孩子赶场。">查看中文翻译</div>

It had been only seven or eight months since she'd seen Marah -- a blip of time -- and yet the girl in front of her was a stranger. A near-woman, Marah was taller than Tully, with milky pale skin, penetrating brown eyes, lush black hair that fell in a waterfall down her back, and cheekbones to die for. "Marah Rose," she said. "You're all grown up. And you're gorgeous. Have you tried modeling?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Kate linked arms with Tully and led her to the sofa. There, with her suitcase positioned at the door like a bodyguard, they spent at least an hour catching up on each others' lives. At around three o'clock they moved their little party to the backyard, where the boys and Marah competed with Kate for Tully's attention. When darkness began to fall, Johnny fired up the barbeque, and on a picnic table in the grass, beneath a dome of stars and beside the placid Sound, Tully had her first home-cooked meal in months. Afterward, they played a rousing game of Candy Land with the boys. While Kate and Johnny were upstairs putting the twins to bed, Tully sat out in the backyard with Marah, each wrapped against the night's chill in yet another of Mrs. Mularkey's famous afghans.</div>

She'd never been one of those people who felt insignificant beneath the heavens, but suddenly she understood why some people did; it was a matter of perspective. She'd spent so much of her life in a rush for the finish line that she'd been left out of breath.

<div class="line_en">"I'm sorry, Tul. Really. Mom and I are running the church food drive on Saturday and Sunday. If I didn't show up it would be a real mess. On Monday and Tuesday I'm volunteering at the Parks and Rec Department, but maybe I could go with you for a few days at the end of next week."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“塔莉，真的很对不起。周六、周日我和妈要帮教堂筹募济贫粮食，要是我没去，一定会乱成一团；星期一和星期二我要去公园休闲管理处当义工，不过下个周末我应该可以陪你去几天。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tully turned the unexpected idea around in her head. It was dangerous for her, certainly; she could be humiliated by her mother. Then again, she could be triumphant, too. A mother-daughter reunion would be TV gold. It surprised her, frankly, that she hadn't thought of it herself. An intimate portrait like this could make her Q rating -- her recognition factor -- skyrocket. Was it worth the risk?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="塔莉反复斟酌这个突如其来的点子。当然，对她而言不无风险，妈妈很可能会给她难看，不过话说回来，她也可能得到极大的荣耀。母女团圆是观众最爱的戏码，老实说，她有点惊讶自己竟然没想到，这样的故事一定能让她的知名度一飞冲天——值得冒这个险吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"If I wait I won't go," Tully said, trying to gather the courage to do it alone. "I guess I can go by myself. I was just worried --"</div>
