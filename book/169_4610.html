<div class="line_en">Taena's black eyes sparkled with mischief. "When she wed Lord Renly at Highgarden, I helped disrobe him for the bedding. His lordship was a well-made man, and lusty. I saw the proof when we tumbled him into the wedding bed where his bride awaited him as naked as her name day, blushing prettily beneath the coverlets. Ser Loras had carried her up the steps himself. Margaery may say that the marriage was never consummated, that Lord Renly had drunk too much wine at the wedding feast, but I promise you, the bit between his legs was anything but weary when last I saw it."</div>

<div class="line_en">A pity. Still, the absence of a bloody sheet meant little, by itself. Common peasant girls bled like pigs upon their wedding nights, she had heard, but that was less true of highborn maids like Margaery Tyrell. A lord's daughter was more like to give her maidenhead to a horse than a husband, it was said, and Margaery had been riding since she was old enough to walk. "I understand the little queen has many admirers amongst our household knights. The Redwyne twins, Ser Tallad… who else, pray tell?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"So I suspect. As a rule the Most Devout elevate one of their own, but there have been exceptions." Grand Maester Pycelle had informed her of the history, at tedious length. "During the reign of King Baelor the Blessed a simple stonemason was chosen as High Septon. He worked stone so beautifully that Baelor decided he was the Smith reborn in mortal flesh. The man could neither read nor write, nor recall the words of the simplest of prayers." Some still claimed that Baelor's Hand had the man poisoned to spare the realm embarrassment. "After that one died, an eight-year-old boy was elevated, once more at King Baelor's urging. The boy worked miracles, His Grace declared, though even his little healing hands could not save Baelor during his final fast."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“据说是这样。其实照惯例，大主教们一般会推选彼此间的一位，偶而才破例。”派席尔不厌其烦地向她讲述过这段冗长的历史。“在受神祝福的贝勒王统治时期，一名石匠被选为总主教，因为他的工艺如此精巧，让贝勒以为他是铁匠的肉体凡身。此人不会读写，连最简单的祷告都学不会。”许多人相信他是被贝勒的首相毒死的，以防国家继续蒙羞。“他死后，教团在贝勒王敦促下，又选出一位八岁男童。国王宣称这孩子能施行奇迹，不过他那双医疗圣手却无法改变国王在绝食斋戒中丧命。”">查看中文翻译</div>

You can always winkle out their birth names if you like, but they take umbrage if you use them. It reminds them that they were born ordinary men, and they do not like that."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“有点难度。通常叫这位为‘胖子’，叫那位作‘胖子前的那位’或’睡觉时死去的那位’。当然，你还是可以用他们的俗名来称呼，但会得罪人的，因为这提醒了他们出身平凡，他们不喜欢这样。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh, he had a name once. They all do." The queen waved a hand dismissively. "Even septons born of noble blood go only by their given names once they have taken their vows. When one of them is elevated to High Septon, he puts aside that name as well. The Faith will tell you he no longer has any need of a man's name, for he has become the avatar of the gods."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他以前当然有名字，修士都有名字，”太后不耐烦地挥挥手，“比方说他若是贵族，发下誓言加入教会时会去掉家族姓氏，只保留自己的名，而一旦成为总主教，就必须放弃所有姓名——教会认为他已当上诸神的代言人，不再需要凡人的名字。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I shall have to take him under consideration." Cersei did not doubt that there were any number of boys who would do more honor to the crystal crown than the wretch on whom the Most Devout had chosen to bestow it. This is what comes of letting fools and cowards rule themselves. Next time, I will choose their master for them. And the next time might not be long in coming, if the new High Septon continued to annoy her. Baelor's Hand had little to teach Cersei Lannister where such matters were concerned.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嗯，我会将他列入考量。”瑟曦才不在乎戴上水晶冠的儿童会做些什么，反正比教团推出的这位贱民好应付。这回听任白痴和懦夫们选择首领，下次就没那么便宜了——如果新任总主教不合我意，这个“下次”很快就会到来。贝勒王的首相是我的榜样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The litter began to slow, which could only mean that they were near the top of the hill. "You should bring this son of yours to court," Cersei told Lady Merryweather. "Six is not too young. Tommen needs other boys about him. Why not your son?" Joffrey had never had a close friend of his own age, that she recalled. The poor boy was always alone. I had Jaime when I was a child… and Melara, until she fell into the well. Joff had been fond of the Hound, to be sure, but that was not friendship. He was looking for the father he never found in Robert. A little foster brother might be just what Tommen needs to wean him away from Margaery and her hens. In time they might grow as close as Robert and his boyhood friend Ned Stark. A fool, but a loyal fool. Tommen will have need of loyal friends to watch his back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="轿子开始慢下来，应是快登上山丘顶了。“你把儿子带进宫吧，”瑟曦告诉玛瑞魏斯夫人，“六岁男孩不小了。托曼需要别的孩子陪伴，你儿子不是可以做他的朋友吗？”乔佛里就没有同龄朋友。可怜的孩子，一直那么孤单，我小时候都有詹姆…和梅拉雅，直到她掉入水井。噢，小乔很喜欢猎狗，可他们之间并非友情，他只是在寻求从劳勃那里没有得到的父爱。一位养兄弟将把托曼从玛格丽和她那群小鸡身边夺过来。假以时日，他们之间将会像劳勃和奈德·史塔克那样亲密。是，奈德是个傻瓜，却是个忠诚的傻瓜。托曼需要忠心耿耿的人替他防备后方。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"In the beginning," the queen allowed, "but he will soon outgrow that, as I did. When my father sent for me to court I wept and Jaime raged, until my aunt sat me down in the Stone Garden and told me there was no one in King's Landing that I need ever fear. 'You are a lioness,' she said, 'and it is for all the lesser beasts to fear you.' Your son will find his courage too.

<div class="line_en">The dromonds rising on the river would give her that. Her flagship would dip twice as many oars as King Robert's Hammer. Aurane had asked her leave to name her Lord Tywin, which Cersei had been pleased to grant. She looked forward to hearing men speak of her father as a "she." Another of the ships would be named Sweet Cersei, and would bear a gilded figurehead carved in her likeness, clad in mail and lion helm, with spear in hand. Brave Joffrey, Lady Joanna, and Lioness would follow her to sea, along with Queen Margaery, Golden Rose, Lord Renly, Lady Olenna, and Princess Myrcella. The queen had made the mistake of telling Tommen he might name the last five. He had actually chosen Moon Boy for one. Only when Lord Aurane suggested that men might not want to serve on a ship named for a fool had the boy reluctantly agreed to honor his sister instead.</div>

The day she wed Robert Baratheon, thousands had turned out to cheer for them. All the women wore their best, and half the men had children on their shoulders. When she had emerged from inside the sept, hand in hand with the young king, the crowd sent up a roar so loud it could be heard in Lannisport.

The great marble statue that had smiled serenely over the plaza for a hundred years was waist-deep in a heap of bones and skulls. Some of the skulls had scraps of flesh still clinging to them.

The Warrior's Sons wore rainbow cloaks and inlaid silver armor over hair shirts, and bore star-shaped crystals in the pommels of their longswords. They were the Swords.

She seldom let more than three days pass without going off for a ride. Some days they would ride along the Rosby road to hunt for shells and eat beside the sea. Other times she would take her entourage across the river for an afternoon of hawking. The little queen was fond of going out on boats as well, sailing up and down the Blackwater Rush to no particular purpose. When she was feeling pious she would leave the castle to pray at Baelor's Sept. She gave her custom to a dozen different seamstresses, was well-known amongst the city's goldsmiths, and had even been known to visit the fish market by the Mud Gate for a look at the day's catch. Wherever she went, the smallfolk fawned on her, and Lady Margaery did all she could to fan their ardor. She was forever giving alms to beggars, buying hot pies off bakers' carts, and reining up to speak to common tradesmen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不用说，我对你的行踪一清二楚，瑟曦心想。她的线人日夜不停地监视着玛格丽。你真是个坐不住的女孩。玛格丽从没有连续三天不出去骑马，有时候她带队巡游罗斯比路，在海边拾捡贝壳，然后野餐；有时候她到河对岸鹰狩半日。小王后也爱乘船，常坐游艇在黑水河上无目的地漫游；偶而虔诚之心犯了，又会远离城堡去贝勒大圣堂祷告。她的衣服分别交给十几位出名的女裁缝制作，都城的金匠们也对她有口皆碑，她甚至出烂泥门到鱼市去视察日常收成。无论走到哪里，她都会引起平民百姓们的狂热，而玛格丽尽其所能地回馈群众。她向乞丐施舍财物，从面包师傅的推车上买热派吃，亲切地与小贩交谈。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Margaery hailed them when the two columns met and fell in beside the queen's litter. Her cheeks were flushed, her brown ringlets tumbling loosely about her shoulders, stirred by every puff of wind. "We have been picking autumn flowers in the kingswood," she told them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两支队伍相遇时，玛格丽冲上前来欢迎致意，随后骑在太后轿边。她面颊潮红，棕色鬈发披散在肩，被风微微吹拂。“我们在御林里摘秋天的花朵呢。”她告诉太后和玛瑞魏斯夫人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And of course a knight of the Kingsguard must accompany the little queen, and of course it is the Knight of Flowers. In white scale armor chased with gold, Ser Loras glittered. Though he no longer presumed to train Tommen at arms, the king still spent far too much time in his company. Every time the boy returned from an afternoon with his little wife, he had some new tale to tell about something that Ser Loras had said or done.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然会有御林铁卫贴身保护小王后，而该人选毫无疑问会是百花骑士。洛拉斯爵士身穿镂金白鳞甲，容光焕发。国王虽没再让他教武，仍喜欢邀他做伴，每当托曼与小王后下午出行返回后，总会兴奋地讲述洛拉斯爵士的新故事或引用洛拉斯爵士的话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But the king was deaf to sense, thanks to his little queen. "If we mingle with the commons, they will love us better."</div>

<div class="line_en">Had it been up to her, she would have had Tommen doing all these things as well. She was forever inviting him to accompany her and her hens on their adventures, and the boy was forever pleading with his mother for leave to go along. The queen had given her consent a few times, if only to allow Ser Osney to spend a few more hours in Margaery's company. For all the good it has done. Osney has proved a grievous disappointment. "Do you remember the day your sister sailed for Dorne?" Cersei asked her son. "Do you recall the mob howling on our way back to the castle? The stones, the curses?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="若能做主的话，她还会把托曼带去做这些事。她不厌其烦地邀请国王与她和她的小鸡们一起外出冒险，托曼便不厌其烦地恳求母亲的准许。太后偶而会表示同意——那只是为了给奥斯尼爵士多创造些机会。枉我设计得如此周全，奥斯尼太让人失望了。“你忘了你姐姐去多恩那天发生的事吗？”瑟曦通常如此教训儿子，“你忘了暴民将我们一路赶回城堡吗？忘了他们扔的石头、忘了他们骂的脏话？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The mob loved the fat High Septon so well they tore him limb from limb, and him a holy man," she reminded him. All it did was make him sullen with her. Just as Margaery wants, I wager. Every day in every way she tries to steal him from me. Joffrey would have seen through her schemer's smile and let her know her place, but Tommen was more gullible. She knew Joff was too strong for her, Cersei thought, remembering the gold coin Qyburn had found. For House Tyrell to hope to rule, he had to be removed. It came back to her that Margaery and her hideous grandmother had once plotted to marry Sansa Stark to the little queen's crippled brother Willas. Lord Tywin had forestalled that by stealing a march on them and wedding Sansa to Tyrion, but the link had been there. They are all in it together, she realized with a start. The Tyrells bribed the gaolers to free Tyrion, and whisked him down the roseroad to join his vile bride. By now the both of them are safe in Highgarden, hidden away behind a wall of roses.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊，暴民们太喜欢那肥胖的总主教了，所以才把他撕成碎片。你记住，他可是日常与民众打交道的神职人员，”她好意提醒儿子，儿子却更不开心。我敢打赌，这是玛格丽·提利尔施用手腕、从中作祟的结果，每一天每一个小时，她都想尽办法要把他从我身边夺走。换成她的长子乔佛里，必能看穿她微笑背后的阴谋，并教她认清自己的位置，可惜托曼很傻很天真。是了，她明白小乔不好操纵，瑟曦想起科本找到的金币，为巩固提利尔家族的权势，一定会除掉他。玛格丽与她那丑恶的祖母曾定计让珊莎·史塔克嫁给残废的维拉斯·提利尔，只不过泰温大人落棋在先，用提利昂夺走了珊莎。我明白了，阴谋家们并不甘心，他们在继续策划，提利尔家贿赂狱卒放走提利昂，并保护他沿玫瑰大道西行，与自己作恶的老婆会合。现在，他们两个一定安安全全地待在高庭，享受玫瑰的庇护。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You should have come along with us, Your Grace," the little schemer prattled on as they climbed the slope of Aegon's High Hill. "We could have had such a lovely time together.

<div class="line_en">"I am so pleased to hear that." The girl did not seem to realize that she had been cut. "You and Tommen must come with us the next time. I know His Grace would love it.

<div class="line_cn" title="“我很高兴您这么说，”女孩似乎没领会她言下之意。“噢，您下次和托曼一起来嘛，我知道，陛下他会喜欢的。有蓝诗人为咱们献唱，塔拉德爵士表演棍棒，就像平民那样。噢，秋天的树林真的好美。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Only one, Your Grace? Who rules the other six?" Margaery laughed a merry little laugh. "You will forgive me my jest, I hope. I know what a burden you bear. You should let me share the load. There must be some things I could do to help you. It would put to rest all this talk that you and I are rivals for the king."</div>

<div class="line_en">"My late husband loved the forest too." In the early years of their marriage, Robert was forever imploring her to hunt with him, but Cersei had always begged off. His hunting trips allowed her time with Jaime. Golden days and silver nights. It was a dangerous dance that they had danced, to be sure. Eyes and ears were everywhere within the Red Keep, and one could never be certain when Robert would return. Somehow the peril had only served to make their times together that much more thrilling. "Still, beauty can sometimes mask deadly danger," she warned the little queen. "Robert lost his life in the woods."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我的先夫热爱森林。”在他们婚姻前期，劳勃没完没了地恳求她同去打猎，但瑟曦一律婉言谢绝，因为国王狩猎期间，她才好跟詹姆幽会。金色的白昼，银色的夜晚。自然，这是场危险的游戏，不仅红堡内耳目众多，关键是谁也拿不准劳勃的心意，不知道他何时会回来。然而，危险却让他们的结合更刺激了。“美丽的外表之下往往隐藏着危险，”她警告小王后，“劳勃就在那片树林里丢掉了性命。”">查看中文翻译</div>
