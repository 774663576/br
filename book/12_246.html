<div class="line_en">The sun was sinking behind the long western arm of the mountains when Gandalf and his companions, and the king with his Riders, set out again from Isengard. Gandalf took Merry behind him, and Aragorn took Pippin. Two of the king's men went on ahead, riding swiftly, and passed soon out of sight down into the valley. The others followed at an easy pace.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ents in a solemn row stood like statues at the gate, with their long arms uplifted, but they made no sound.

<div class="line_en">"So you heard that?" said Gandalf. "Don't let it rankle! Be thankful no longer words were aimed at you. He had his eyes on you. If it is any comfort to your pride, I should say that, at the moment, you and Pippin are more in his thoughts than all the rest of us. Who you are; how you came there, and why; what you know; whether you were captured, and if so, how you escaped when all the Orcs perished -- it is with those little riddles that the great mind of Saruman is troubled. A sneer from him, Meriadoc, is a compliment, if you feel honoured by his concern."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你也听到啦？”甘道夫说：“别太在意！你应该很高兴那些话都不是对着你说的。他之前从来没有遇过哈比人，因此不知道该对你说些什么，希望这能够挽回你的自尊心：你和皮聘现在是他脑中最忧虑的两个人。你们是谁？是怎么到这边的？又是为了什么？你们知道些什么？你们是否真被俘虏过？如果是这样，又是如何在半兽人全员阵亡的状况下逃出来的？萨鲁曼聪明一世的脑袋里面，全都耗费在担心这个东西上。梅里雅达克啊，如果你对于他的关心感到骄傲，那么他轻蔑的笑容其实算是对你们的赞美。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Gandalf laughed. "A most unquenchable hobbit! All Wizards should have a hobbit or two in their care -- to teach them the meaning of the word, and to correct them. I beg your pardon. But I have given thought even to these simple matters. We will ride for a few hours, gently, until we come to the end of the valley. Tomorrow we must ride faster."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="甘道夫笑了：“真是紧追不舍的哈比人哪！所有的巫师都应该随时带着哈比人在身边，一方面可以教导他们用词遣字，一方面还可以纠正巫师。真抱歉，但我连这些细节都已经想好了。我们可以比较轻松地骑几个小时，到了谷口就休息，明天比较需要赶路。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"When we came, we meant to go straight from Isengard back to the king's house at Edoras over the plains, a ride of some days. But we have taken thought and changed the plan. Messengers have gone ahead to Helm's Deep, to warn them that the king is returning tomorrow. He will ride from there with many men to Dunharrow by paths among the hills. From now on no more than two or three together are to go openly over the land, by day or night, when it can be avoided."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊，是赢了，但这只是第一场胜利，这场胜利还会为我们带来更多危险。魔多和艾辛格之间必定有某种联系，我还没有搞清楚。他们到底是怎么交换情报的呢？我还不知道，但他们彼此之间确有往来。我想魔王之眼一定会更加频繁地注视巫师谷和洛汗，让它看见越少越好。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At last they halted. Then they turned aside, leaving the highway and taking to the sweet upland turf again. Going westward a mile or so they came to a dale. It opened southward, leaning back into the slope of round Dol Baran, the last hill of the northern ranges, greenfooted, crowned with heather. The sides of the glen were shaggy with last year's bracken, among which the tight-curled fronds of spring were just thrusting through the sweet-scented earth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，他们停了下来。稍后离开了大路，走上斜坡。一行人往西走了不到一哩，就来到了一个山谷中。山谷的开口朝向南方，靠着圆形的山丘，那也是北方山脉的最后起伏。草地的边缘因为去年留下的枯草而起伏不平，今年刚冒出来的新芽则显出一副欣欣向荣的样子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The road passed slowly, winding down the valley. Now further, and now nearer Isen flowed in its stony bed. Night came down from the mountains. All the mists were gone. A chill wind blew. The moon, now waxing round, filled the eastern sky with a pale cold sheen. The shoulders of the mountain to their right sloped down to bare hills. The wide plains opened grey before them.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="在靠近河岸的地方，荆棘长得十分茂盛，午夜之前两小时左右，他们就在附近扎营。众人在谷地中点燃了营火，坐在一株茂密的山楂树下，这棵树虽然经历了不少岁月，但每个枝干依旧十分硬朗，上面几乎都长满了花苞。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“真的吗？太好了！他嘴还是很紧吧？一点都没变。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, if Gandalf has changed at all, then he's closer than ever that's all," Pippin argued. "That -- glass ball, now. He seemed mighty pleased with it. He knows or guesses something about it. But does he tell us what? No, not a word. Yet I picked it up, and I saved it from rolling into a pool. Here, I'll take that, my lad -- that's all. I wonder what it is? It felt so very heavy." Pippin's voice fell very low, as if he was talking to himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，如果甘道夫真的改变了，那我看他更是守口如瓶了，”皮聘争辩道：“特别是──那个玻璃珠。他似乎很高兴可以拿到这东西。他已经知道了一些有关它的事情。但他有没有告诉我们？没有，一个字也没有。是我把它捡起来，免得它掉进水池里面。‘来，小朋友，交给我──’就这样而已。不知道那究竟是什么？那感觉起来好沉重。”皮聘的声音越变越低，彷佛在和自己说话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh yes, he is!" said Merry, waking up a little, and beginning to wonder what was bothering his companion. "He has grown, or something. He can be both kinder and more alarming, merrier and more solemn than before, I think. He has changed; but we have not had a chance to see how much, yet. But think of the last part of that business with Saruman! Remember Saruman was once Gandalf's superior: head of the Council, whatever that may be exactly. He was Saruman the White. Gandalf is the White now. Saruman came when he was told, and his rod was taken; and then he was just told to go, and he went!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没错！”梅里稍稍清醒了一些，开始担忧到底是什么让伙伴辗转反侧。“他似乎成长了些，他可以同时更体贴，又更警觉；他变了，但我们还没有机会了解到底变了多少。你想想上次我们对付萨鲁曼的状况！萨鲁曼以前是甘道夫的上级长官，他可是议会议长，管那是什么意思。他曾经是白袍萨鲁曼，但现在白袍的称号被甘道夫继承了。萨鲁曼听话的过来，让人夺走他的手杖，最后也听话乖乖地离开了！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Hullo!" said Merry. "So that's what is bothering you? Now, Pippin my lad, don't forget Gildor's saying -- the one Sam used to quote: Do not meddle in the affairs of Wizards, for they are subtle and quick to anger."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“醒醒吧！”梅里说：“原来你就是挂心着这个东西啊？皮聘老友，别忘记吉尔多所说的话，山姆最爱引用的那句：不要插手巫师的事务，他们心机深沉，易动怒。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Pippin said no more. He lay still now, but sleep remained far away; and it was not encouraged by the sound of Merry breathing softly, asleep in a few minutes after saying good night. The thought of the dark globe seemed to grow stronger as all grew quiet. Pippin felt again its weight in his hands, and saw again the mysterious red depths into which he had looked for a moment. He tossed and turned and tried to think of something else.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮聘没有再说什么，他躺着不动，但就是睡不着。梅里躺下去不久就开始发出均匀的呼吸声，这也没有多大帮助。那颗黑球的影响似乎随着四周越来越安静，也变得愈加强烈。皮聘可以一直感受到它在手中的重量，再度看见其中旋转的红色光芒，他翻来覆去的想要把思绪转到别的地方去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At last he could stand it no longer. He got up and looked round. It was chilly, and he wrapped his cloak about him. The moon was shining cold and white, down into the dell, and the shadows of the bushes were black. All about lay sleeping shapes. The two guards were not in view: they were up on the hill, perhaps, or hidden in the bracken. Driven by some impulse that he did not understand, Pippin walked softly to where Gandalf lay. He looked down at him. The wizard seemed asleep, but with lids not fully closed: there was a glitter of eyes under his long lashes. Pippin stepped back hastily. But Gandalf made no sign; and drawn forward once more, half against his will, the hobbit crept up again from behind the wizard's head. He was rolled in a blanket, with his cloak spread over the top; and close beside him, between his right side and his bent arm, there was a hummock, something round wrapped in a dark cloth; his hand seemed only just to have slipped off it to the ground.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，他终于忍不住了，他站了起来，看着四周，天气有点冷，他只能裹紧斗篷。月亮散发着冷白的光芒，四周则被树木的黑影包围，显得黑漆漆的。皮聘在一种自己也无法理解的意念驱使下，蹑手蹑脚地走到甘道夫的身边。他低头看着对方。巫师似乎睡着了，但他的眼睛并没有完全闭起来，从睫毛之间还可以看到他的眼珠。皮聘慌乱地退后几步，看到甘道夫没有反应之后，哈比人觉得自己被不属于自己的意志推动着，从巫师脑袋的方向靠近。甘道夫裹在毯子里面，外面则盖着斗篷，在他身边，右手旁有一团东西，好象是什么圆圆的物体被包在黑布中，他的手似乎刚刚才滑到地面上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Hardly breathing, Pippin crept nearer, foot by foot. At last he knelt down. Then he put his hands out stealthily, and slowly lifted the lump up: it did not seem quite so heavy as he had expected. "Only some bundle of oddments, perhaps, after all," he thought with a strange sense of relief; but he did not put the bundle down again. He stood for a moment clasping it. Then an idea came into his mind. He tiptoed away, found a large stone, and came back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮聘屏住呼吸，悄悄地靠近。最后，他跪了下来，小心翼翼地伸出手，将那一团东西拿起，这东西似乎没有原先以为的那么重。“或许只是个包裹吧！”他心里其实感觉松了口气，但手却没有将东西放下来。他抱着那东西发呆了片刻，然后突然想到了一个点子。他又蹑手蹑脚地溜走，找到一颗大石头，再无声无息走回来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You idiotic fool!" Pippin muttered to himself. "You're going to get yourself into frightful trouble. Put it back quick!" But he found now that his knees quaked, and he did not dare to go near enough to the wizard to reach the bundle. "I'll never get it back now without waking him," he thought, "not till I'm a bit calmer. So I may as well have a look first. Not just here though!" He stole away, and sat down on a green hillock not far from his bed. The moon looked in over the edge of the dell.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你这个笨蛋！”皮聘对自己说：“你会惹上大麻烦的，快把它放回去！”但他这才意识到自己两腿发软，不敢再回到巫师身边拿布包。“我这次一定会把他弄醒的，”他想，“最好等我冷静一些再说。既然这样，我不如就先看看吧。当然不是在这里！”他在距离自己的小床不远的地方找了块岩石坐下来，月亮俯视着山谷的边缘。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Quickly now he drew off the cloth, wrapped the stone in it and kneeling down, laid it back by the wizard's hand. Then at last he looked at the thing that he had uncovered. There it was: a smooth globe of crystal, now dark and dead, lying bare before his knees. Pippin lifted it, covered it hurriedly in his own cloak, and half turned to go back to his bed. At that moment Gandalf moved in his sleep, and muttered some words: they seemed to be in a strange tongue; his hand groped out and clasped the wrapped stone, then he sighed and did not move again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他很快的将外面的布抽掉，将石头包进去，跪下来将布包放回巫师的手中。这时，他才有时间仔细打量他刚发现的东西。就是这个，一颗光滑的圆球，现在看起来显得死气沉沉。皮聘举起圆球，很快地用自己的斗篷遮住他，转过身准备走回床边。就在那时，甘道夫动了动，嘟哝了几个字，似乎是种奇怪的语言；然后他伸出手，摸到了布包，就满足的叹口气，没有再做出任何动作。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"So this is the thief!" said Gandalf. Hastily he cast his cloak over the globe where it lay. "But you, Pippin! This is a grievous turn to things!" He knelt by Pippin's body: the hobbit was lying on his back, rigid, with unseeing eyes staring up at the sky. "The devilry! What mischief has he done -- to himself, and to all of us?" The wizard's face was drawn and haggard.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“原来这位就是小偷啊！”甘道夫说，他匆忙地将斗篷遮住那水晶球。“皮聘，这对你来说实在是很糟糕的状况啊！”他跪在皮聘的身边，这名哈比人双眼圆睁，动也不动地看着天空。“这是诅咒！他到底对自己做了什么，又对我们做了什么？”巫师的神情苍白而忧虑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The cry was piercing. The guards leapt down from the banks. All the camp was soon astir.</div>

<div class="line_en">Pippin sat with his knees drawn up and the ball between them. He bent low over it, looking like a greedy child stooping over a bowl of food, in a corner away from others. He drew his cloak aside and gazed at it. The air seemed still and tense about him. At first the globe was dark, black as jet, with the moonlight gleaming on its surface. Then there came a faint glow and stir in the heart of it, and it held his eyes, so that now he could not look away. Soon all the inside seemed on fire; the ball was spinning, or the lights within were revolving. Suddenly the lights went out. He gave a gasp and struggled; but he remained bent, clasping the ball with both hands. Closer and closer he bent, and then became rigid; his lips moved soundlessly for a while. Then with a strangled cry he fell back and lay still.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮聘用膝盖夹住水晶球。他低头看着，像是饥饿的孩子找了个角落打量着汤碗一样。他掀开斗篷，仔细地看着水晶球。四周的空气似乎突然间变得十分沉重，一开始水晶球黑得像墨水一样，月光反射在它的表面；然后，球心似乎发出微光，起了一阵骚动，而有种力量让他无法移开双眼。很快的，里面似乎陷入了火焰，不知道是球本身在旋转还是里面的光芒在移动。突然间，光芒熄灭了，他吃了一惊，开始挣扎，但身体姿势依旧是弯腰盯着水晶球，双手抱着不放。他的头越来越靠近，最后僵硬得不能动弹；他的嘴唇无声地移动了片刻，然后，突然间喊了一声，动也不动地倒在地上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In a low hesitating voice Pippin began again, and slowly his words grew clearer and stronger. "I saw a dark sky, and tall battlements," he said. "And tiny stars. It seemed very far away and long ago, yet hard and clear. Then the stars went in and out -- they were cut off by things with wings. Very big, I think, really; but in the glass they looked like bats wheeling round the tower. I thought there were nine of them. One began to fly straight towards me, getting bigger and bigger. It had a horrible -- no, no! I can't say."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮聘用迟疑、缓慢的语调再度开口了，他的声音慢慢的变得清晰、有力。“我看见黑色的天空，和很雄伟的堡垒，”他说：“还有小小的星辰，它看起来似乎很远、很古老，但又十分的清晰。然后，那些星辰开始闪烁，似乎被什么有翅膀的东西遮住了。我想那些东西真的很大，但从水晶球里面看起来像是蝙蝠绕着高塔在飞。我想应该有几只，有一只直接朝向我飞过来，变得越来越大。它有种恐怖的──不，不行！我说不出口。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"All right!" he said. "Say no more! You have taken no harm. There is no lie in your eyes, as I feared. But he did not speak long with you. A fool, but an honest fool, you remain, Peregrin Took. Wiser ones might have done worse in such a pass. But mark this! You have been saved, and all your friends too, mainly by good fortune, as it is called. You cannot count on it a second time. If he had questioned you, then and there, almost certainly you would have told all that you know, to the ruin of us all. But he was too eager. He did not want information only: he wanted you, quickly, so that he could deal with you in the Dark Tower, slowly. Don't shudder! If you will meddle in the affairs of Wizards, you must be prepared to think of such things. But come! I forgive you. Be comforted! Things have not turned out as evilly as they might."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好啦！”他说：“不用再说了！你没有受伤。幸好，你没有说谎，但这是因为他没有和你接触太久。皮聘，你是个笨蛋，但至少还是个诚实的笨蛋。更聪明的人或许会在这样的遭遇中犯下大错。不过，给我记住！你和所有的朋友可以逃过一劫，单纯的只是好运而已，这不会发生第二次。如果他在当下就质问你，那你一定会把所知全部告诉他，让我们全都身陷险境。但他太急躁了，他不只想要情报，更想要快点得到你，这样，他才可以在邪黑塔中慢慢对付你。别发抖！如果你想要介入巫师的事务，就必须准备好面对这样的状况。来吧！我原谅了你，别担心，事情没有想象中那么糟糕。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Never yet. Do not then stumble at the end of the road," answered Gandalf. "But at the least keep this thing secret. You, and all others that stand here! The hobbit, Peregrin, above all should not know where it is bestowed. The evil fit may come on him again. For alas! he has handled it and looked in it, as should never have happened. He ought never to have touched it in Isengard, and there I should have been quicker. But my mind was bent on Saruman, and I did not at once guess the nature of the Stone. Then I was weary, and as I lay pondering it, sleep overcame me. Now I know!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这是说不准的，行百里者半九十，许多错误常常是在最后犯下的。”甘道夫回答：“至少请你不要大肆宣扬，不只你，还有在座的诸位！尤其不能让哈比人皮聘知道它在何处。因为它的诱惑或许会再度施展，因为他根本不该去用它，甚至是碰触。他在艾辛格就不应该碰触它，我的动作应该更快一些的。但当时我只顾着监视萨鲁曼，最后才发现这是什么。到了现在，我才能够绝对确定这块石头的真正来历。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"That many times is seen," said Gandalf. "But at this time we have been strangely fortunate. Maybe, I have been saved by this hobbit from a grave blunder. I had considered whether or not to probe this Stone myself to find its uses. Had I done so, I should have been revealed to him myself. I am not ready for such a trial, if indeed I shall ever be so. But even if I found the power to withdraw myself, it would be disastrous for him to see me, yet -- until the hour comes when secrecy will avail no longer."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这已经证实了许多次，”甘道夫说：“但这次我们的运气实在太好了。或许这名哈比人替我阻挡了一次极大的危险。我之前本来想要亲自测试这枚石头，看看它的用途，如果我这样做了，可能就在他面前展露了行踪。就算这是不可避免的，但我还是没准备好面对这样的考验。即使我拥有力量逃脱，光是被他在时机到来之前发现，就是极大的危险。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Not yet," said Gandalf. "There remains a short while of doubt, which we must use. The Enemy, it is clear, thought that the Stone was in Orthanc -- why should he not? And that therefore the hobbit was captive there, driven to look in the glass for his torment by Saruman. That dark mind will be filled now with the voice and face of the hobbit and with expectation: it may take some time before he learns his error. We must snatch that time. We have been too leisurely. We must move. The neighbourhood of Isengard is no place now to linger in. I will ride ahead at once with Peregrin Took. It will be better for him than lying in the dark while others sleep."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“还没，”甘道夫说：“他正好处在短暂的疑惑中，我们必须好好把握。魔王还以为这枚水晶球还在欧散克塔中，当然了，他没有理由怀疑。因此，哈比人是被关在那边，在萨鲁曼的逼迫下使用那颗水晶球，是种对他的折磨。魔王的心中将会充满了这哈比人的声音和影像，可能要一段时间之后才会发现他的错误，我们必须把握这段时间。我们之前已经太松懈了，现在必须快点。艾辛格的邻近地带已经不再适合久留，我会立刻带着皮聘往前走。这比让他一个人躺在黑暗中安全多了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No," said Gandalf. "Nor by Saruman. It is beyond his art, and beyond Sauron's too. The palantíri came from beyond Westernesse, from Eldamar. The Noldor made them. Fëanor himself, maybe, wrought them, in days so long ago that the time cannot be measured in years. But there is nothing that Sauron cannot turn to evil uses. Alas for Saruman! It was his downfall, as I now perceive. Perilous to us all are the devices of an art deeper than we possess ourselves. Yet he must bear the blame. Fool! to keep it secret, for his own profit. No word did he ever speak of it to any of the Council. We had not yet given thought to the fate of the palantíri of Gondor in its ruinous wars. By Men they were almost forgotten. Even in Gondor they were a secret known only to a few; in Arnor they were remembered only in a rhyme of lore among the Dúnedain."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，”甘道夫说。“也不是萨鲁曼作的。这超越了他的能力，也超越了索伦的能力。‘帕兰特里’是来自于西方皇族之前的种族，艾尔达马大陆上的诺多精灵所创造的，甚至是法诺王子亲自打造的，距今的年代久远到无法用年月的单位来度量。很遗憾，没有什么东西是索伦不能够拿来供作邪恶之用。萨鲁曼也真是不幸，我现在才推测出来，这颗真知晶球多半就是他堕落的根源。任何胆敢使用超乎自己力量的装置，都会身陷危险。但真正该怪的其实还是自己。愚蠢！竟然将这样东西密藏起来，希望藉此获益。他对议会的成员从来没有提过这样东西。我们根本不知道有任何的帕兰特里躲过了刚铎古代的大战。在议会之外，人类和精灵甚至都已经忘却有这样东西的存在，只有在亚拉冈的同胞所拥有的历史歌谣之中才代代相传。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"To see far off, and to converse in thought with one another," said Gandalf. "In that way they long guarded and united the realm of Gondor. They set up Stones at Minas Anor, and at Minas Ithil, and at Orthanc in the ring of Isengard. The chief and master of these was under the Dome of Stars at Osgiliath before its ruin. The three others were far away in the North. In the house of Elrond it is told that they were at Annúminas, and Amon Súl, and Elendil's Stone was on the Tower Hills that look towards Mithlond in the Gulf of Lune where the grey ships lie."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Each palantír replied to each, but all those in Gondor were ever open to the view of Osgiliath. Now it appears that, as the rock of Orthanc has withstood the storms of time, so there the palantír of that tower has remained. But alone it could do nothing but see small images of things far off and days remote. Very useful, no doubt, that was to Saruman; yet it seems that he was not content. Further and further abroad he gazed, until he cast his gaze upon Barad-dûr. Then he was caught!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“每枚真知晶球都可以和彼此交谈，但在奥斯吉力亚斯的那一枚则可以同时监控所有的晶球。看来，欧散克塔不只不受岁月的侵蚀，连其中的晶球都依然留了下来。如果只有这一枚，其实只能看见远方的事物和过去的影响，并不能有什么特别的作用。毫无疑问的，这样对于喜欢研究历史的萨鲁曼来说，就已经非常足够了。但是，似乎他并不觉得满足。他越看越远，直到他的眼光来到巴拉多，在那边他就落入了陷阱！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Easy it is now to guess how quickly the roving eye of Saruman was trapped and held; and how ever since he has been persuaded from afar, and daunted when persuasion would not serve. The biter bit, the hawk under the eagle's foot, the spider in a steel web! How long, I wonder, has he been constrained to come often to his glass for inspection and instruction, and the Orthanc-stone so bent towards Barad-dûr that, if any save a will of adamant now looks into it, it will bear his mind and sight swiftly thither? And how it draws one to itself! Have I not felt it? Even now my heart desires to test my will upon it, to see if I could not wrench it from him and turn it where I would -- to look across the wide seas of water and of time to Tirion the Fair, and perceive the unimaginable hand and mind of Fëanor at their work, while both the White Tree and the Golden were in flower!" He sighed and fell silent.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Of course not," said Gandalf. "It is two hundred leagues or more in straight flight from Barad-dûr to Orthanc, and even a Nazgûl would take a few hours to fly between them. But Saruman certainly looked in the Stone since the orc-raid, and more of his secret thought, I do not doubt, has been read than he intended. A messenger has been sent to find out what he is doing. And after what has happened tonight another will come, I think, and swiftly. So Saruman will come to the last pinch of the vice that he has put his hand in. He has no captive to send. He has no Stone to see with, and cannot answer the summons. Sauron will only believe that he is withholding the captive and refusing to use the Stone. It will not help Saruman to tell the truth to the messenger. For Isengard may be ruined, yet he is still safe in Orthanc. So whether he will or no, he will appear a rebel. Yet he rejected us, so as to avoid that very thing! What he will do in such a plight, I cannot guess. He has power still, I think, while in Orthanc, to resist the Nine Riders. He may try to do so. He may try to trap the Nazgûl, or at least to slay the thing on which it now rides the air. In that case let Rohan look to its horses!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然不知道，”甘道夫说：“从巴拉多直飞欧散克塔也要六百哩，即使是戒灵也要花上几个小时才能够飞得到。我猜，萨鲁曼在派出半兽人之后一定曾经用过这晶石，而他内心的想法都已经在不知不觉中被人所知。那个信差是来搞清楚他到底在做些什么。在今晚的意外之后，还会有另一名戒灵飞快的赶过来。如此一来，萨鲁曼就会对着陷阱踏出最后一步。他手中没有俘虏，又没有真知晶球可以使用，更无法回应魔王的召唤。索伦将会认为他把俘虏藏起来，并且拒绝使用真知晶球。即使萨鲁曼对信差说实话，也不会有什么帮助。虽然艾辛格被毁了，但他依旧安全的躲在欧散克塔中。不管他怎么做，看起来都会像是一名背叛者。但是他竟然还拒绝我们，想要躲过这危机！连我都无法猜测在这状况下他会怎么做。只要还在欧散克塔，我想他还是拥有抵抗九骑士的力量。他可能会尝试着这样做。他可能会试着困住戒灵，或至少杀死他们所骑乘的座骑。如果那样的话，洛汗国就必须小心的看管马匹了！”">查看中文翻译</div>
