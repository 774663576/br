<div class="line_en">My phone rang. It was Adam from Pathology Blawg. I'd sought his help eight months earlier when I was trying to understand the complexities of laboratory billing for one of my stories in the Medicare series. He'd patiently explained to me what lab procedures certain billing codes corresponded to -- knowledge I'd later used to expose a scam at a big operator of cancer treatment centers.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was the second Monday in February and I was sitting at my messy desk in the Wall Street Journal's Midtown Manhattan newsroom casting about for a new story to sink my teeth into. I'd recently finished work on a year-long investigation of Medicare fraud and had no idea what to do next. After sixteen years at the Journal, this was something I still hadn't mastered: the art of swiftly and efficiently transitioning from one investigative project to the next.</div>

<div class="line_en">Now that he mentioned it, there were some things I'd read in that article that I'd found suspect. The lack of any peer-reviewed data to back up the company's scientific claims was one of them. I'd reported about health-care issues for the better part of a decade and couldn't think of any serious advances in medicine that hadn't been subject to peer review. I'd also been struck by a brief description Holmes had given of the way her secret blood-testing devices worked: "A chemistry is performed so that a chemical reaction occurs and generates a signal from the chemical interaction with the sample, which is translated into a result, which is then reviewed by certified laboratory personnel."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在经他一提起，我想起当时看那篇报导就对部分内容有些怀疑。其中一点是，竟然没有任何同侪审查数据可佐证那家公司宣称的科学进展。这十年来，我多半在报导医疗健康相关议题，想不出有任何重大医疗进展没有接受同侪审查。此外，我也很惊讶霍姆斯对她神秘的血液检测设备所做的描述：「运行一种化学作用，因此会有一种化学反应产生，而且样本所产生的化学反应会产生一种信号，信号会转化成结果，再由合格的实验室人员进行检查。」">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Adam asked if I'd read a recent feature in The New Yorker about a Silicon Valley prodigy named Elizabeth Holmes and her company, Theranos. As it turned out, I had. I subscribed to the magazine and often read it on the subway to and from work.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="亚当问我有没有看过《纽约客》最近一篇特别报导，关于硅谷一个叫做伊莉莎白．霍姆斯的奇才以及她的公司Theranos，正巧我看了，我有订阅《纽约客》杂志，常在上下班通勤地铁上翻阅。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When I stopped to think about it, I found it hard to believe that a college dropout with just two semesters of chemical engineering courses under her belt had pioneered cutting-edge new science. Sure, Mark Zuckerberg had learned to code on his father's computer when he was ten, but medicine was different: it wasn't something you could teach yourself in the basement of your house. You needed years of formal training and decades of research to add value. There was a reason many Nobel laureates in medicine were in their sixties when their achievements were recognized.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我静下心来仔细想想，很难相信一个只上了两个学期化工课程的大学辍学生，有能力开创出最尖端的新设备。没错，脸书的马克．祖克伯十岁就用爸爸的电脑学会写程序，但是医学不一样，医学并不是在自家地下室就能自学成功的，而是需要多年的正规训练，再加上数十年的研究来增加价值。所以，很多诺贝尔医学奖得主都是到了六十几岁才获得成就上的认可。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Adam said that he'd had a similar reaction to the New Yorker piece and that a group of people had contacted him after he'd posted a skeptical item on his blog about it. He was cryptic about their identities and their connection to Theranos at first, but he said they had information about the company I'd want to hear. He said he'd check with them to see if they were willing to talk to me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="亚当说他对《纽约客》的文章也有同样反应，他在自己的博客贴出怀疑论点后，有一组人联系上他。起初他不愿透露那些人的身分以及他们跟Theranos的关系，不过他说他们知道那家公司一些数据，我应该会想听听看。他说会去问问他们是否愿意跟我谈谈。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the meantime, I did some preliminary research on Theranos and came across the Journal's editorial-page piece from seventeen months earlier. I hadn't seen it when it was published. This added an interesting wrinkle, I thought: my newspaper had played a role in Holmes's meteoric rise by being the first mainstream media organization to publicize her supposed achievements. It made for an awkward situation, but I wasn't too worried about it. There was a firewall between the Journal's editorial and newsroom staffs. If it turned out that I found some skeletons in Holmes's closet, it wouldn't be the first time the two sides of the paper had contradicted each other.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在此同时，我对Theranos做了初步研究，发现《华尔街日报》十七个月前登在社论版面那篇报导，当初刊出时我并没有看到，我心想，这下多了一个有趣的小麻烦：原来，我服务的报纸在她流星般窜起的过程中也扮演了一个角色，是第一家公开宣传她所谓「成就」的主流媒体。这让情况变得有点尴尬，不过我倒不是很担心。《华尔街日报》的社论和新闻编辑部人员中间设有防火墙，要是最后我真的发现霍姆斯有不可告人的丑事，也不会是本报第一次发生两边不同调。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Two weeks after our initial conversation, Adam put me in touch with Richard and Joe Fuisz, Phyllis Gardner, and Rochelle Gibbons. It was disappointing at first to hear that the Fuiszes had been involved in litigation with Theranos. Even if they insisted they'd been wrongly accused, the lawsuit gave them a big ax to grind and made them useless as sources.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最初那次谈话后隔了两周，亚当帮我联系上理查．傅伊兹和乔．傅伊兹、菲丽丝．嘉德纳、罗雪儿．吉本斯。一开始，我很失望听到傅伊兹父子曾经跟Theranos有官司牵扯，即使他们坚称自己遭到诬告，那起诉讼仍然会令人联想他们父子是别有用心，使他们成为无效的数据源。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But my ears pricked up when I heard that they had talked to Theranos's just-departed laboratory director and that he was alleging some sort of wrongdoing at the company. I also found the story of Ian Gibbons tragic and was intrigued by the fact that Rochelle said he'd confided to her on several occasions that the Theranos technology wasn't working. It was the type of thing that would have been dismissed as hearsay in court, but it seemed credible enough to merit a closer look. In order to take this any further, though, what I needed to do next was clear: I needed to talk to Alan Beam.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，一听到他们跟刚从Theranos离职的实验室主管谈过，我的耳朵就竖了起来，那个主管指控Theranos有某些不法行为。另外，我也觉得伊恩．吉本斯的故事是个悲剧，听罗雪儿说到伊恩跟她透露好几次Theranos的技术不管用，我的好奇心也被激起了。这种情况在法庭上会被斥为传闻而不受理，但是看来有其可信度，值得仔细一探究竟。不过，要能够取得任何进展，接下来我该做的事情很清楚：我必须直接跟艾伦．毕姆谈一谈。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The first half dozen times I dialed Alan's number, I got his voicemail. I didn't leave a message and instead resolved to just keep trying him. On the afternoon of Thursday, February 26, 2015, a voice with an accent I couldn't quite place finally answered the phone. After ascertaining that it was in fact Alan, I introduced myself and told him I understood he had recently left Theranos with concerns about the way the company was operating.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一开始我拨了六次艾伦的电话号码，都是直接进入语音信箱，我没有留言，决定一直打到有人接为止。二〇一五年二月二十六日星期四下午，电话那头终于有人接起，说着我听不出是哪个地方的口音。确定真的是艾伦之后，我介绍自己，告诉他我知道他最近因为对Theranos的运作有所疑虑而刚离职。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It took me a while to understand the dilution part. Why would they do that and why was it bad? I asked. Alan explained that it was to make up for the fact that the Edison could only do a category of tests known as immunoassays. Theranos didn't want people to know its technology was limited, so it had contrived a way of running small finger-stick samples on conventional machines. This involved diluting the finger-stick samples to make them bigger. The problem, he said, was that when you diluted the samples, you lowered the concentration of analytes in the blood to a level the conventional machines could no longer measure accurately.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我花了点时间了解稀释的部分。我问他，为什么要稀释？稀释为什么不好？艾伦解释说，稀释是为了掩饰爱迪生只能做一种叫做「免疫测定」的检测，Theranos不希望外界知道它的技术有其局限，所以想出一个用传统仪器来检测指尖血液小样本的方法，这个方法必须先稀释手指样本来增加分量。他说，这么做的问题是，样本稀释后，血液中所含的待测物质浓度就会随之降低，降到传统仪器无法精准量测的程度。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">With the ground rules for our conversation established, Alan let down his guard and we talked for more than an hour. One of the first things he said was that what Ian had told Rochelle was true: the Theranos devices didn't work. They were called Edisons, he said, and were error prone. They constantly failed quality control. Furthermore, Theranos used them for only a small number of tests. It performed most of its tests on commercially available instruments and diluted the blood samples.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="基本原则确立后，艾伦卸下防卫，我们谈了一个多小时。他说的第一件事是，伊恩告诉罗雪儿的事是真的：Theranos的设备不能用。他说，那些设备称为爱迪生，很容易出错，品管测试常不合格，而且Theranos只有少数检测是用爱迪生运行，其余大部分是用市面上买得到的商用仪器，并且还对血液样本做了稀释。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I could sense he was very nervous, but he also seemed to want to unburden himself. He told me he would speak to me only if I promised to keep his identity confidential. Theranos's lawyers had been harassing him and he was certain the company would sue him if it found out he was talking to a reporter. I agreed to grant him anonymity. It wasn't a hard decision. Without him, all I had were secondhand sources and informed speculation. If he wouldn't talk, there would be no story.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我可以感觉到他非常紧张，但他似乎也想一吐为快。他告诉我，愿意跟我谈谈，前提是我必须承诺对他的身分保密，Theranos的律师一直在骚扰他，他很确定如果Theranos发现他跟记者接触，一定会告他。我答应不透露他的身分。这不是困难的决定，要是没有他，我手上所有数据都是二手的，全是听来的揣测，如果他不讲，就不会有报导。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He said he had tried to delay the launch of Theranos's blood tests in Walgreens stores and had warned Holmes that the lab's sodium and potassium results were completely unreliable. According to Theranos's tests, perfectly healthy patients had levels of potassium in their blood that were off the charts. He used the word "crazy" to describe the results. I was barely getting my head around these revelations when Alan mentioned something called proficiency testing. He was adamant that Theranos was breaking federal proficiency-testing rules. He even referred me to the relevant section of the Code of Federal Regulations: 42 CFR, part 493. I wrote it down in my notebook and told myself to look it up later.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他说自己曾要求延后Theranos在沃尔格林门市推出其血液检测，也曾警告霍姆斯，实验室所做的钠和钾检测结果完全不可信，根据Theranos所做的检测，健康无虞的人血液中测出的钾含量高到爆表，他形容那些检测结果是「疯了」。艾伦提到某个「能力测试」的名词时，我也听不懂，他很坚持Theranos违反了联邦政府的能力测试规定，他甚至要我去参考联邦法规第四十二篇第四百九十三节，我边写在笔记本，边在心里记着事后要去查一查。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Alan also said that Holmes was evangelical about revolutionizing blood testing but that her knowledge base in science and medicine was poor, confirming my instincts. He said she wasn't the one running Theranos day-to-day. A man named Sunny Balwani was. Alan didn't mince his words about Balwani: he was a dishonest bully who managed through intimidation. Then he dropped another bombshell: Holmes and Balwani were romantically involved. I knew from reading the New Yorker and Fortune articles and from browsing the Theranos website that Balwani was the company's president and chief operating officer. If what Alan was saying was true, this added a new twist: Silicon Valley's first female billionaire tech founder was sleeping with her number-two executive, who was nearly twenty years her senior.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="艾伦还告诉我，霍姆斯对血液检验的革新是抱着宗教般狂热的信仰，但她在科学和医学方面的知识基础却很薄弱，这一点证实了我的直觉。他说，负责Theranos日常营运的人并不是霍姆斯，而是一个叫桑尼．包汪尼的人。艾伦对包汪尼的形容可就完全不假辞色：他是个不老实的恶霸，用恐吓威胁来管理公司。接着他又丢下另一个震撼弹：霍姆斯和包汪尼是恋人关系。根据我从《纽约客》和《财星》文章所读到的，还有从Theranos网站所看到的，包汪尼是那家公司的总裁，也是首席运营官；如果艾伦的说法属实，又给这个故事增添一个曲折：硅谷第一位身价数十亿美元的女性科技创业家，跟她的第二号高层同床共枕，而且还是个比她年长将近二十岁的男人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Alan said he had raised his concerns about proficiency testing and the reliability of Theranos's test results with Holmes and Balwani a number of times in person and by email. But Balwani would always either rebuff him or put him off, making sure to copy a Theranos lawyer on their email exchanges and to write, "Consider this attorney-client confidential."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="艾伦说，他多次透过电邮或当面向霍姆斯、包汪尼提起，他对能力测试以及Theranos检测结果的可信度有疑虑，但包汪尼不是断然驳斥就是意图要他打退堂鼓，每次包汪尼都会把他们往来的信件用副本寄给Theranos的律师，上面还写着：「把这列入律师与客户之间的保密内容。」">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As the laboratory director whose name had been on the Theranos lab's CLIA license, Alan was worried that he would be held personally responsible if there was ever a government investigation. To protect himself, he told me he'd forwarded dozens of his email exchanges with Balwani to his personal email account. But Theranos had found that out and threatened to sue him for breaching his confidentiality agreement.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="身为实验室主管，自己的名字就挂在Theranos的CLIA执照上，艾伦很担心，万一政府展开调查，他个人得负起责任。为了自保，他告诉我，他把数十封与包汪尼往来的电邮，转寄到自己的电邮信箱，但被Theranos发现了，威胁要控告他违反保密协议。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was sloppy corporate governance, but then again this was a private company. There were no rules against that sort of thing in Silicon Valley's private startup world. What I found more interesting was the fact that Holmes seemed to be hiding the relationship from her board. Why else would the New Yorker article have portrayed her as single, with Henry Kissinger telling the magazine that he and his wife had tried to fix her up on dates? If Holmes wasn't forthright with her board about her relationship with Balwani, then what else might she be keeping from it?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是个公司治理松散的故事，不过话又说回来，那是一家私营公司，没有任何法规规定硅谷的私营新创公司不可以有这类事情。我发现比较有意思的地方是：霍姆斯似乎向董事会隐瞒这段恋情，不然为什么《纽约客》的文章把她描绘为单身，亨利．季辛吉还告诉杂志说他和太太要替她安排相亲？如果霍姆斯没有向董事会据实以告她跟包汪尼的关系，那她是不是可能还隐瞒了什么？">查看中文翻译</div>

One of them, a former Theranos CLS, wouldn't say much, but what she did say gave me confidence that I was on the right track: she told me she had been very troubled by what was going on at the company and concerned for patient safety.

He revealed something else that hadn't come up in our first call: Theranos's lab was divided into two parts. One contained the commercial analyzers and the other the Edison devices. During her inspection of the lab, a state inspector had been shown only the part with the commercial analyzers. Alan felt she'd been deceived.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was all beginning to make sense: Holmes and her company had overpromised and then cut corners when they couldn't deliver. It was one thing to do that with software or a smartphone app, but doing it with a medical product that people relied on to make important health decisions was unconscionable. Toward the end of this second phone conversation, Alan mentioned something else I found of interest: George Shultz, the former secretary of state who was a Theranos board member, had a grandson named Tyler who had worked at the company. Alan wasn't sure why Tyler had left but he didn't think it was on good terms. I was jotting things down in the Notes app of my iPhone and added Tyler's name as another potential source.</div>

<div class="line_en">A few days later, Alan got back in touch with some good news. I had asked him to call the Washington, D. C., whistleblower law firm he'd reached out to in the fall to see if he could retrieve the email exchange with Balwani he had sent to it. The firm had just complied with his request. Alan forwarded the exchange to me. It was a chain of eighteen emails about proficiency testing between Sunny Balwani, Daniel Young, Mark Pandori, and Alan. It showed Balwani angrily admonishing Alan and Mark Pandori for running the proficiency-testing samples on the Edison and reluctantly acknowledging that the device had "failed" the test. Moreover, it left no doubt that Holmes knew about the incident: she was copied on most of the emails.</div>

Off the record meant I couldn't make any use of the information. The conversation was nonetheless helpful because this source confirmed a lot of what Alan had told me, giving me the confidence to forge on.

<div class="line_en">Although it was a big setback, I was slowly making headway on other fronts. Wanting a neutral opinion from a lab expert about Theranos's dilution of blood samples and the way it conducted proficiency testing, I called Timothy Hamill, vice chairman of the University of California, San Francisco's Department of Laboratory Medicine. Tim confirmed to me that both practices were highly questionable. He also explained the pitfalls of using blood pricked from a finger. Unlike venous blood drawn from the arm, capillary blood was polluted by fluids from tissues and cells that interfered with tests and made measurements less accurate. "I'd be less surprised if they told us they were time travelers who came back from the twenty-seventh century than if they told us they cracked that nut," he said.</div>

<div class="line_en">Before his change of heart, Alan had mentioned a nurse in Arizona named Carmen Washington who worked at a clinic owned by Walgreens and had complained about Theranos's blood tests. After trying to track her down for several weeks, I finally got her on the phone. She told me three of her patients had received questionable results from the company. One was a sixteen-year-old girl with a sky-high potassium result that suggested she was at risk of a heart attack. The result hadn't made sense given that she was a teenager and in good health, Carmen said. Two other patients had received results showing abnormally high levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone, or TSH. Carmen had called them back in to the clinic and redrawn their blood. The second time, their results had come back abnormally low. After that, Carmen had lost faith in Theranos's finger-stick tests. These incidents tracked with Alan's claims. TSH was one of the immunoassays Theranos performed on the Edison that had failed proficiency testing.</div>

<div class="line_en">I had another lead, though, after scanning Yelp to see if anyone had complained about a bad experience with Theranos. Sure enough, a woman who appeared to be a doctor and went by "Natalie M." had. Yelp has a feature that allows you to send messages to reviewers, so I sent her a note with my contact information. She called me the next day. Natalie M.'s real name was Nicole Sundene. She was a family practitioner in the Phoenix suburb of Fountain Hills and she was very unhappy with Theranos. The previous fall, she had sent one of her patients to the emergency room because of a frightening lab report from the company only to find out it was a false alarm. I flew to Phoenix to meet Dr. Sundene and her patient. While there, I also planned to drop in unannounced on other physician practices that used Theranos for their lab tests.

Glunz had spent four hours in the emergency room on the eve of Thanksgiving while doctors ran a battery of tests on her, including a CT scan. She'd been discharged after a new set of blood tests performed by the hospital's lab came back normal. That hadn't been the end of it, however.

The Theranos wellness center inside the Walgreens wasn't much to behold: it was a little room not much bigger than a closet with a chair and little bottles of water.

<div class="line_en">I spent the next few days knocking on the doors of other doctors' offices. At a practice in Scottsdale, I talked to Drs. Adrienne Stewart, Lauren Beardsley, and Saman Rezaie. Dr. Stewart described a patient of hers who had postponed a long-planned trip to Ireland at the last minute because of a test result from Theranos suggesting she might have deep vein thrombosis, a condition that occurs when a blood clot forms, usually in the legs. People with DVT aren't supposed to fly because of the risk the clot will break loose, travel through the bloodstream, and lodge in the lungs, causing a pulmonary embolism. Dr. Stewart had subsequently set aside the Theranos result when ultrasounds of the patient's legs and a second set of blood-test results from another lab had been normal.</div>

<div class="line_en">I wasn't entirely surprised. Alan Beam had explained to me that, of the more than 240 tests Theranos offered on its menu, only about 80 were performed on small finger-stick samples (a dozen on the Edison and another 60 or 70 on the hacked Siemens machines). The rest, he'd said, required what Holmes had likened in media interviews to a medieval torture mechanism: the dreaded hypodermic needle. I now had my confirmation of that. After walking out of the Walgreens, I drove my rental car to a nearby LabCorp site and submitted to another blood draw. Dr. Sundene promised to send me both sets of results when they arrived.

<div class="line_en">I also met with Dr. Gary Betz, a family practitioner in another part of town who had stopped sending his patients to Theranos after a bad experience involving one of them the previous summer. That patient, also a woman, was on medication to reduce her blood pressure. One of the medicine's potential side effects was high potassium, so Dr. Betz monitored her blood regularly. After Theranos reported a near critical potassium value for the patient, a nurse in Dr. Betz's office sent her back there to get tested again to make sure the result was correct. But during the second visit, the phlebotomist made three unsuccessful attempts to draw her blood and then sent her home. Dr. Betz was furious when he found out the next day: if the original result was correct, it was imperative that he get confirmation of it as soon as possible so he could make changes to her treatment. He sent the patient to get retested at Sonora Quest. As it turned out, it was another false alarm: the potassium value Sonora Quest reported that evening was much lower than the Theranos result and well within the normal range. Dr. Betz told me the episode had shattered his trust in Theranos.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="另外，我还见了盖瑞．贝兹医师（Dr. Gary Betz），他是镇上另一区的家庭医师，去年夏天曾跟Theranos有不好的合作经验，从此不再把病人送到那里检验。那次的病人也是女性，正在服用降血压药物，药物的可能副作用之一是钾会增高，所以贝兹医师定期监控她的血液。Theranos检验的钾数值逼近临界点之后，贝兹医师诊所的护士请她回去Theranos再做一次检验，确定检验结果是否正确。不过，这次抽血人员抽了三次血还是不成功，就要她回家了。贝兹医师隔天得知此事暴怒，因为万一第一次检验结果是对的，他就得尽快完成确认才能赶快改变病人的治疗方式。他把那个患者送到索诺拉奎斯特重新检验，结果又是虚惊一场。索诺拉奎斯特当晚测出的钾数值，比Theranos测得的数值低很多，落在正常区间。贝兹医师告诉我，这起事件粉碎了他对Theranos的信任。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The incident had made her leery when Theranos sent her a lab report for another one of her patients showing an abnormally high TSH value. The patient was already on thyroid medication and the result suggested that her dose needed to be raised. Before she did anything, Dr. Stewart sent the patient to get retested at Sonora Quest, a joint venture of Quest and the hospital system Banner Health. The Sonora Quest result came back normal. Had she trusted the Theranos result and increased the patient's medication dosage, the outcome could have been disastrous, Dr. Stewart said. The patient was pregnant. Increasing her dosage would have made her levels of thyroid hormone too high and put her pregnancy at risk.</div>

<div class="line_en">A few days later, I was back at my desk at the Journal when a mailroom employee handed me a thick envelope. It was from Dr. Sundene. Inside were our lab reports from Theranos and LabCorp. As I scanned my results, I noticed a number of discrepancies. Theranos had flagged three of my values as abnormally high and one as abnormally low. Yet on LabCorp's report, all four of those values showed up as normal. Meanwhile, LabCorp had flagged both my total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol (otherwise known as bad cholesterol) as high, while the Theranos report described the first as "desirable" and the second as "near optimal."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几天后，我回到《华尔街日报》的办公桌前，收发室同仁递给我一个厚厚的信封，是桑定医师寄来的，里面是我们去Theranos和美国实验室所做的检验报告。我大致看了一下检验结果，发现两份报告有几个不一致的地方。Theranos的报告里，我有三个数值异常偏高、一个异常偏低，而美国实验室的报告里，所有四个数值都是正常。同时，美国实验室把我的总胆固醇和低密度脂蛋白胆固醇（LDL，通常称为坏胆固醇）都标示为「高」；而Theranos的报吿，则说我的总胆固醇是「理想」（desirable）、低密度脂蛋白胆固醇是「接近最佳」（near optimal）。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Those differences were mild compared to a whopper Dr. Sundene had found in her results. According to Theranos, the amount of cortisol in her blood was less than 1 microgram per deciliter. A value that low was usually associated with Addison's disease, a dangerous condition characterized by extreme fatigue and low blood pressure that could result in death if it went untreated. Her LabCorp report, however, showed a cortisol level of 18.8 micrograms per deciliter, which was within the normal range for healthy patients. Dr. Sundene had no doubt which of the two values was the correct one.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="相较于桑定医师的检验报告，我的报告差异算是小巫见大巫。根据Theranos的报告，桑定医师血液里的皮质醇（cortisol）含量，为每公合（deciliter）不到一微克（microgram）。这么低的数值通常代表跟爱迪生氏病（Addison's disease）有关，那是一种很危险的病症，会出现极度疲劳和低血压，若没有接受治疗可能会致命。然而美国实验室的报告却显示，她的皮质醇含量是每公合十八‧八微克，属于健康人的正常区间。这两个数值到底哪个才正确，桑定医师当然心知肚明。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As someone who had worked in the Theranos lab, Erika had witnessed the December 2013 lab inspection firsthand. Like Alan, she felt the state inspector had been misled. She told me lab members had been under explicit orders not to enter or exit Normandy during the inspection and that the door leading down to it had been kept locked. She also told me about her friendship with Tyler and about the dinner she'd attended at George Shultz's house the night Tyler had resigned. Like Tyler, she was appalled by the lack of scientific rigor that had gone into validating the assays on the Edisons. She said Theranos should never have gone live testing patient samples. The company routinely ignored quality-control failures and test errors and showed a complete disregard for the well-being of patients, she said. In the end, she had resigned because she was sickened by what she had become a party to, she told me. These were strong words, and it was clear from how distraught Erika was that she meant them.</div>

<div class="line_en">I asked him whether he thought his grandfather was still loyal to Holmes. Yes, there was little doubt in his mind that he was, he replied. When I asked him what made him think that, he revealed a new anecdote. The Shultz family tradition was to celebrate Thanksgiving at the former secretary of state's home. When Tyler, his brother, and his parents had arrived at his grandfather's house that day, they'd come face-to-face with Holmes and her parents. George had invited them too. A mere seven months had passed since Tyler's resignation and the wounds were still fresh, but he had been forced to act as if nothing had happened. The awkward dinner conversation had drifted from California's drought to the bulletproof windows in the new Theranos headquarters. For Tyler, the most excruciating moment had been when Holmes got up and gave a toast expressing her love and appreciation for every member of the Shultz family. He said he'd barely been able to contain himself.</div>

It was early evening and the place was packed with young Silicon Valley professionals enjoying happy hour. We couldn't find seats, so we stood around a wooden beer barrel on the terrace outside and used it as a table. Over a pint of cold ale, Tyler gave me a more detailed account of his time at Theranos, including the frantic call from his mother relaying Holmes's threat the day he resigned and his and Erika's attempts to talk sense into George Shultz that evening. He had tried to follow his parents' advice and to put the whole thing behind him but he'd found himself unable to.</div>

<div class="line_en">I next met up with Phyllis Gardner, the Stanford medical school professor Holmes had consulted about her original patch idea when she'd dropped out of college twelve years earlier. Phyllis gave me a tour of the Stanford campus and its surroundings. As we drove around in her car, I was struck by how small and insular Palo Alto was. Phyllis's home was just down the hill from George Shultz's big shingled house, and both were on land owned by Stanford. When Phyllis walked her dog, she sometimes ran into Channing Robertson. The Hoover Institution building where George Shultz and the other Theranos board members had offices was right in the middle of the campus. The new Theranos headquarters on Page Mill Road was less than two miles away on land that was also owned by Stanford. In a strange twist, Phyllis told me the site used to be a Wall Street Journal printing plant.</div>

<div class="line_en">On the last day of my trip, I met Rochelle Gibbons for lunch at Rangoon Ruby, a Burmese restaurant in Palo Alto. It had been two years since Ian had died, but Rochelle was still grieving and struggled to hold back tears. She blamed Theranos for his death and wished he had never worked there. She provided a copy of the doctor's note a Theranos attorney had encouraged Ian to use to avoid being deposed in the Fuisz case. The time stamp on the attorney's email showed that it was sent just a few hours before Ian committed suicide. Rochelle spoke on the record even though she had inherited from her husband Theranos stock options that were potentially worth millions of dollars. She didn't care about the money, she said, and in any case, she didn't believe the shares were really worth anything.</div>
