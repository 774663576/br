<div class="line_en">"And now that the great ones have gone to discuss high matters," said Legolas, "the hunters can perhaps learn the answers to their own small riddles. We tracked you as far as the forest, but there are still many things that I should like to know the truth of."</div>

<div class="line_en">Gandalf and the King's company rode away, turning eastward to make the circuit of the ruined walls of Isengard. But Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas remained behind. Leaving Arod and Hasufel to stray in search of grass, they came and sat beside the hobbits.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="甘道夫和国王一行人往东骑去，准备绕过艾辛格残破的城墙；但亚拉冈、金雳和勒苟拉斯则留了下来，他们让阿罗德和哈苏风在附近吃草，在哈比人身边坐了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Then you shall have it," said Pippin. "Will you have it here, or in more comfort in what's left of Saruman's guard-house -- over there under the arch? We had to picnic out here, so as to keep an eye on the road."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没问题！”皮聘说：“你们要在这边吃，还是在萨鲁曼的卫哨室废墟里面吃？它就在拱门底下那边。我们刚刚在这里野餐，因为得注意道路上的动静。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“有烟草吗？”金雳说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, I don't think so," Merry laughed. "But that is another story, which can wait until after lunch."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，我想没有好到那个地步，”梅里笑着说：“不过，那又是另一个故事了，我们可以等到吃完午餐再说。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We wouldn't ask you to," said Merry. "We have had enough of Orcs ourselves to last a life-time. But there were many other folk in Isengard. Saruman kept enough wisdom not to trust his Orcs. He had Men to guard his gates: some of his most faithful servants, I suppose. Anyway they were favoured and got good provisions."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们可不敢要你这样做，”梅里说：“我们也已经受够了半兽人。别忘记，艾辛格还有许多其它的种族。萨鲁曼还算聪明，不敢完全信任半兽人，他有人类看守大门，我想这是他最忠实的仆人。反正哪，他们可是相当受到宠幸，拥有很不错的补给品唷！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Less than an eye!" said Gimli. "But I will not go into any orc-house; nor touch Orcs' meat or anything that they have mauled."</div>

<div class="line_en">The hobbits led the way; and they passed under the arch and came to a wide door upon the left, at the top of a stair. It opened direct into a large chamber, with other smaller doors at the far end, and a hearth and chimney at one side. The chamber was hewn out of the stone; and it must once have been dark, for its windows looked out only into the tunnel. But light came in now through the broken roof. On the hearth wood was burning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈比人在前面带路，一行人通过了拱门，在左边找到了一连串的阶梯，在顶上有一扇门，那扇门直接通往一个大房间，远端则有其它的小门，甚至还有壁炉和烟囱。这个房间是由岩石所打造的，过去可能十分的昏暗，因为它唯一的窗户是面向隧道的。不过，由于屋顶已经被打破，外面的日光就直接流泄进来，壁炉内还正燃着熊熊的火焰。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I lit a bit of fire," said Pippin. "It cheered us up in the fogs. There were few faggots about, and most of the wood we could find was wet. But there is a great draught in the chimney: it seems to wind away up through the rock, and fortunately it has not been blocked. A fire is handy. I will make you some toast. The bread is three or four days old, I am afraid."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我生了一些火，”皮聘说：“在大雾里面烤火感觉好多了。附近柴火很少，我们能找到的几乎都泡湿了。幸好壁炉里面还藏了不少，而烟囱也没有被堵塞。有火真的很方便，我帮你烤些面包吧！不过，这些面包恐怕已经有点久了，大概做了三四天吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"And you need not turn up your nose at the provender, Master Gimli," said Merry. "This is not orc-stuff, but man-food, as Treebeard calls it. Will you have wine or beer? There's a barrel inside there -- very passable. And this is first-rate salted pork. Or I can cut you some rashers of bacon and broil them, if you like. I am sorry there is no green stuff: the deliveries have been rather interrupted in the last few days! I cannot offer you anything to follow but butter and honey for your bread. Are you content?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“金雳大爷，你也不需要闻到味道就皱鼻子，”梅里说：“树胡说，这些可不是半兽人的东西，而是人类的食物。你想喝葡萄酒还是啤酒？里面还有一桶啤酒，味道不错喔！这是顶级的腌猪肉，如果你需要的话，我也可以替你切一些培根，帮你煎一煎。真抱歉没有蔬菜啊，过去几天补给可能稍稍受到了一些影响吧！除了奶油和蜂蜜之外，我也没有别的东西可以让你夹面包，这样满意吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You are full of courtesy this morning," laughed Legolas. "But maybe, if we had not arrived, you would already have been keeping one another company again."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你们今天早上可还真是有礼貌啊！”勒苟拉斯笑着说：“不过，如果我们没来，可能你们也会继续再吃下去吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The three were soon busy with their meal; and the two hobbits, unabashed, set to a second time. "We must keep our guests company," they said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="三人很快地狼吞虎咽起来，两名哈比人也跟着凑热闹似地开怀大吃：“我们可不能坐在旁边发呆，这样未免太失礼了！”他们说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Indeed yes," said Gimli. "The score is much reduced."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，还算满意啦，”金雳说：“我的怒气一看到食物就阵亡不少罗！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Maybe; and why not?" said Pippin. "We had foul fare with the Orcs, and little enough for days before that. It seems a long while since we could eat to heart's content."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“或许吧，为什么不呢？”皮聘说：“我们可是和半兽人周旋了很久，在那之前又都吃得很少，很久没有开怀大吃了哪！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It does not seem to have done you any harm," said Aragorn. "Indeed you look in the bloom of health."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这似乎没有对你造成任何伤害，”阿拉贡说。“你看起来真的很健康。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Aye, you do indeed," said Gimli, looking them up and down over the top of his cup. "Why, your hair is twice as thick and curly as when we parted; and I would swear that you have both grown somewhat, if that is possible for hobbits of your age. This Treebeard at any rate has not starved you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，的确是，”金雳从杯边打量着两人：“哇！你们的头发比我们上次看到的时候又浓密了许多，甚至变得更卷了些。我打赌你们好象还长高了一点，我不知道像你们这种年纪的哈比人还会长高啊？这个树胡可没让你们饿着吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He has not," said Merry. "But Ents only drink, and drink is not enough for content. Treebeard's draughts may be nourishing, but one feels the need of something solid. And even lembas is none the worse for a change."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他是没有，”梅里说：“但是树人靠着喝东西过活，光喝东西可是很难让我填饱肚子的。树胡的饮料可能营养充足，但我们总觉得要有些可以嚼的食物才能够填饱肚子，即使是精灵的干粮也会吃腻的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Ents," said Pippin, "Ents are -- well Ents are all different for one thing. But their eyes now, their eyes are very odd." He tried a few fumbling words that trailed off into silence. "Oh, well," he went on, "you have seen some at a distance, already -- they saw you at any rate, and reported that you were on the way -- and you will see many others, I expect, before you leave here. You must form your own ideas."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“树人是…”皮聘说：“树人──树人每个都不一样，但他们的眼睛，他们的眼睛真的很特别。”他嗫嚅了几句，最后又闭上嘴。“喔，好吧，”他继续道：“你们应该已经从远方看过这些树人了，至少他们看见了你们，回报说你们已经在过来的路上了。我想，在你们离开这里之前，应该会看到更多的树人，你们会有自己的看法的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You shall have it, if there is time," said Merry. "But first -- if you have finished eating -- you shall fill your pipes and light up. And then for a little while we can pretend that we are all back safe at Bree again, or in Rivendell."</div>

<div class="line_en">He produced a small leather bag full of tobacco. "We have heaps of it," he said; "and you can all pack as much as you wish, when we go. We did some salvage-work this morning, Pippin and I. There are lots of things floating about. It was Pippin who found two small barrels, washed up out of some cellar or store-house, I suppose. When we opened them, we found they were filled with this: as fine a pipe-weed as you could wish for, and quite unspoilt."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他掏出了一个装满烟草的袋子。“我们有一大堆喔，”他说：“在离开这里之前，你们爱拿多少就拿多少，皮聘和我今天早上可做了不少资源回收的工作，水上漂着各种各样的东西。我们找到了两个小桶，我想是从某个仓库里面被冲出来的吧，当我们打开桶盖的时候，发现里面装满了这些东西：顶级的烟草，而且还没有坏呢！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Gimli took some and rubbed it in his palms and sniffed it. "It feels good, and it smells good," he said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="金雳捏了一些，在手掌中揉搓着，又闻了闻。“摸起来很好，闻起来更香！”他说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It is good!" said Merry. "My dear Gimli, it is Longbottom Leaf! There were the Hornblower brandmarks on the barrels, as plain as plain. How it came here, I can't imagine. For Saruman's private use, I fancy. I never knew that it went so far abroad. But it comes in handy now!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这真的很棒！”梅里说：“我亲爱的金雳啊，这是长底叶！桶子上面还有吹号者家的标签，很明显呢！我不知道这是怎么跑到这边来的，我想，多半是萨鲁曼专用的吧。不知道这东西会运到这么远的地方来，不过，现在正好派上用场。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It would," said Gimli, "if I had a pipe to go with it. Alas, I lost mine in Moria, or before. Is there no pipe in all your plunder?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是啦，”金雳说：“如果我有烟斗就更好了，唉，我的在摩瑞亚还是什么时候弄丢了。你们有没有找到烟斗呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, I am afraid not," said Merry. "We have not found any, not even here in the guardrooms. Saruman kept this dainty to himself, it seems. And I don't think it would be any use knocking on the doors of Orthanc to beg a pipe of him! We shall have to share pipes, as good friends must at a pinch."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，恐怕没有，”梅里说：“我们没找到，在这房间里面也没有，萨鲁曼喜欢自己享受。我想，就算现在去敲欧散克塔的大门跟他要烟斗，恐怕也没什么用吧！看来我们得要一起分享好东西啦。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Half a moment!" said Pippin. Putting his hand inside the breast of his jacket he pulled out a little soft wallet on a string. "I keep a treasure or two near my skin, as precious as Rings to me. Here's one: my old wooden pipe. And here's another: an unused one. I have carried it a long way, though I don't know why. I never really expected to find any pipe-weed on the journey, when my own ran out. But now it comes in useful after all." He held up a small pipe with a wide flattened bowl, and handed it to Gimli. "Does that settle the score between us?" he said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“等等！”皮聘说。他把手伸进外套的胸前口袋，掏出一个绑在绳子上的小袋子。“我竟然收藏了两个比魔戒还要珍贵的宝物──这是一个，我自己的旧木头烟斗，还有另一个，以前没用过的新烟斗。我带着这两样东西到处跑，连我自己也不知道为什么；在我的烟草用完之后，我也不认为路上还会找到烟草。不过，现在还是派上用场了。”他掏出一个扁扁的小烟斗，递给金雳，“这样你总该不生气了吧？”他说。">查看中文翻译</div>

With that he plunged into an account of Boromir's last fight and the orc-march from Emyn Muil to the Forest. The others nodded as the various points were fitted in with their guesses.</div>

I don't know much about this war, or about the Horsemen of Rohan, but Saruman seems to have meant to finish off the king and all his men with one final blow. He emptied Isengard. I saw the enemy go: endless lines of marching Orcs; and troops of them mounted on great wolves. And there were battalions of Men, too. Many of them carried torches, and in the flare I could see their faces. Most of them were ordinary men, rather tall and dark-haired, and grim but not particularly evil-looking. But there were some others that were horrible: man-high, but with goblin-faces, sallow, leering, squint-eyed.

There was no answer, except arrows and stones from the walls. But arrows are no use against Ents. They hurt them, of course, and infuriate them: like stinging flies. But an Ent can be stuck as full of orc-arrows as a pin-cushion, and take no serious harm. They cannot be poisoned, for one thing; and their skin seems to be very thick, and tougher than bark. It takes a very heavy axe-stroke to wound them seriously. They don't like axes.

His knowledge was deep, his thought was subtle, and his hands marvellously skilled; and he had a power over the minds of others. The wise he could persuade, and the smaller folk he could daunt. That power he certainly still keeps. There are not many in Middle-earth that I should say were safe, if they were left alone to talk with him, even now when he has suffered a defeat.

His wizardry may have been falling off lately, of course; but anyway I think he has not much grit, not much plain courage alone in a tight place without a lot of slaves and machines and things, if you know what I mean.

But the night had opened out, and there was a great light of stars, quite enough for Ents to see by, and suddenly Quickbeam gave a cry 'The tree-killer, the tree-killer!' Quickbeam is a gentle creature, but he hates Saruman all the more fiercely for that: his people suffered cruelly from orc-axes. He leapt down the path from the inner gate, and he can move like a wind when he is roused. There was a pale figure hurrying away in and out of the shadows of the pillars, and it had nearly reached the stairs to the tower-door. But it was a near thing. Quickbeam was so hot after him, that he was within a step or two of being caught and strangled when he slipped in through the door."</div>

As soon as our attack began, the few remaining rats in Isengard started bolting through every hole that the Ents made. The Ents let the Men go, after they had questioned them, two or three dozen only down at this end. I don't think many orc-folk, of any size, escaped. Not from the Huorns: there was a wood full of them all round Isengard by that time, as well as those that had gone down the valley."</div>

They roared and boomed and trumpeted, until stones began to crack and fall at the mere noise of them. Merry and I lay on the ground and stuffed our cloaks into our ears. Round and round the rock of Orthanc the Ents went striding and storming like a howling gale, breaking pillars, hurling avalanches of boulders down the shafts, tossing up huge slabs of stone into the air like leaves. The tower was in the middle of a spinning whirlwind. I saw iron posts and blocks of masonry go rocketing up hundreds of feet, and smash against the windows of Orthanc. But Treebeard kept his head. He had not had any burns, luckily. He did not want his folk to hurt themselves in their fury, and he did not want Saruman to escape out of some hole in the confusion. Many of the Ents were hurling themselves against the Orthanc-rock; but that defeated them. It is very smooth and hard. Some wizardry is in it, perhaps, older and stronger than Saruman's.

Suddenly up came fires and foul fumes: the vents and shafts all over the plain began to spout and belch. Several of the Ents got scorched and blistered.

<div class="line_en">"So Treebeard went out into the ring and shouted. His enormous voice rose above all the din. There was a dead silence, suddenly. In it we heard a shrill laugh from a high window in the tower. That had a queer effect on the Ents. They had been boiling over; now they became cold, grim as ice, and quiet. They left the plain and gathered round Treebeard, standing quite still. He spoke to them for a little in their own language; I think he was telling them of a plan he had made in his old head long before. Then they just faded silently away in the grey light. Day was dawning by that time."</div>

All that day they were busy, out of sight. Most of the time we were left alone. It was a dreary day; and we wandered about a bit, though we kept out of the view of the windows of Orthanc, as much as we could: they stared at us so threateningly. A good deal of the time we spent looking for something to eat. And also we sat and talked, wondering what was happening away south in Rohan, and what had become of all the rest of our Company. Every now and then we could hear in the distance the rattle and fall of stone, and thudding noises echoing in the hills."</div>

There was a great shadowy wood of Huorns at the head of the valley, and another round the northern wall. We did not dare to go in. But there was a rending, tearing noise of work going on inside. Ents and Huorns were digging great pits and trenches, and making great pools and dams, gathering all the waters of the Isen and every other spring and stream that they could find. We left them to it."</div>

I asked him if he was tired. 'Tired?' he said, 'tired? Well no, not tired, but stiff. I need a good draught of Entwash. We have worked hard; we have done more stone-cracking and earth-gnawing today than we have done in many a long year before. But it is nearly finished. When night falls do not linger near this gate or in the old tunnel! Water may come through -- and it will be foul water for a while, until all the filth of Saruman is washed away. Then Isen can run clean again.' He began to pull down a bit more of the walls, in a leisurely sort of way, just to amuse himself."</div>

But then I remembered a queer look he gave us at the time. I can only suppose that he had seen Gandalf or had some news of him, but would not say anything in a hurry.

Later there was a great rumble of thunder away south, and flashes of lightning far away across Rohan.

By the morning, yesterday morning, the water had sunk down into all the holes, and there was a dense fog. We took refuge in that guardroom over there; and we had rather a fright. The lake began to overflow and pour out through the old tunnel, and the water was rapidly rising up the steps. We thought we were going to get caught like Orcs in a hole; but we found a winding stair at the back of the store-room that brought us out on top of the arch. It was a squeeze to get out, as the passages had been cracked and half blocked with fallen stone near the top. There we sat high up above the floods and watched the drowning of Isengard. The Ents kept on pouring in more water, till all the fires were quenched and every cave filled. The fogs slowly gathered together and steamed up into a huge umbrella of cloud: it must have been a mile high. In the evening there was a great rainbow over the eastern hills; and then the sunset was blotted out by a thick drizzle on the mountain-sides. It all went very quiet. A few wolves howled mournfully, far away. The Ents stopped the inflow in the night, and sent the Isen back into its old course. And that was the end of it all."</div>

If Saruman peeps out of any of his windows, it must look an untidy, dreary mess. We felt very lonely. Not even a visible Ent to talk to in all the ruin; and no news. We spent the night up on top there above the arch, and it was cold and damp and we did not sleep. We had a feeling that anything might happen at any minute. Saruman is still in his tower. There was a noise in the night like a wind coming up the valley. I think the Ents and Huorns that had been away came back then; but where they have all gone to now, I don't know.

<div class="line_cn" title="“话一说完，那个落魄的家伙就跳进水中。他走了不远，水就快淹到他的脖子，最后，我看到他抱着桶子还是什么东西开始漂流。但树胡涉水靠近，监视着他的进度。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"'Well, he has gone in,' he said when he returned. 'I saw him crawling up the steps like a draggled rat. There is someone in the tower still: a hand came out and pulled him in. So there he is, and I hope the welcome is to his liking. Now I must go and wash myself clean of the slime. I'll be away up on the north side, if anyone wants to see me. There is no clean water down here fit for an Ent to drink, or to bathe in. So I will ask you two lads to keep a watch at the gate for the folk that are coming. There'll be the Lord of the Fields of Rohan, mark you! You must welcome him as well as you know how: his men have fought a great fight with the Orcs. Maybe, you know the right fashion of Men's words for such a lord, better than Ents. There have been many lords in the green fields in my time, and I have never learned their speech or their names. They will be wanting man-food, and you know all about that, I guess. So find what you think is fit for a king to eat, if you can.' And that is the end of the story. Though I should like to know who this Wormtongue is. Was he really the king's counsellor?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"He was," said Aragorn; "and also Saruman's spy and servant in Rohan. Fate has not been kinder to him than he deserves. The sight of the ruin of all that he thought so strong and magnificent must have been almost punishment enough. But I fear that worse awaits him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他是的，”亚拉冈说：“同时兼任萨鲁曼的间谍和洛汗的公仆。这家伙的命运实在不好，无敌壮丽的王国在他面前毁于一旦的滋味恐怕就够受了。但是，我想，塔里面可能还有更可怕的遭遇在等待着他。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, I don't suppose Treebeard sent him to Orthanc out of kindness," said Merry. "He seemed rather grimly delighted with the business, and was laughing to himself when he went to get his bathe and drink. We spent a busy time after that, searching the flotsam, and rummaging about. We found two or three store-rooms in different places nearby, above the flood-level. But Treebeard sent some Ents down, and they carried off a great deal of the stuff."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没错，我并不认为树胡让这家伙进入欧散克塔是出于同情，”梅里说：“树胡似乎自得其乐，当他去喝水和洗澡的时候还在傻笑呢。在那之后我们花了很大的功夫搜寻漂在水上的残骸。我们在附近的几个地方，找到了几间在水线以上的储藏室，但树胡还派了一些树人过来，带走不少东西。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"'We want man-food for twenty-five,' the Ents said, so you can see that somebody had counted your company carefully before you arrived. You three were evidently meant to go with the great people. But you would not have fared any better. We kept as good as we sent, I promise you. Better, because we sent no drink."</div>

<div class="line_en">"All except one thing," said Aragorn: "leaf from the Southfarthing in Isengard. The more I consider it, the more curious I find it. I have never been in Isengard, but I have journeyed in this land, and I know well the empty countries that lie between Rohan and the Shire. Neither goods nor folk have passed that way for many a long year, not openly. Saruman had secret dealings with someone in the Shire, I guess. Wormtongues may be found in other houses than King Théoden's. Was there a date on the barrels?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“只有一件事情例外，”亚拉冈说：“夏尔南区的烟叶怎么会来到艾辛格，我越想就越不对。我之前没有来过艾辛格，但我曾经到过附近，对于在夏尔和洛汗之间的荒地相当了解。已经有许多年两边没有任何货物的往来和贸易，至少不是公开的。我猜，萨鲁曼应该和夏尔的某个人有秘密的往来，巧言或许不只出现在希优顿的皇室中。桶上的制造日期是什么时候？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"'There is water of Isen,' they said, 'and that is good enough for Ents and Men.' But I hope that the Ents may have found time to brew some of their draughts from the mountain-springs, and we shall see Gandalf's beard curling when he returns. After the Ents had gone, we felt tired, and hungry. But we did not grumble -- our labours had been well rewarded. It was through our search for man-food that Pippin discovered the prize of all the flotsam, those Hornblower barrels. 'Pipe-weed is better after food,' said Pippin; that is how the situation arose."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“‘艾辛河的水就够了，’他们说：‘对人类或是树人都够好了。’不过，我还是希望树人们可以酿出他们爱喝的那种饮料，这样一来，我们就可以看见甘道夫翘着胡子回到我们面前。在树人走掉之后，我们觉得又饿又累，但我们并没抱怨，实际上，我们的努力换来丰富的报酬。在那一阵忙乱之中，皮聘发现了这些残骸中的宝物，吹号者牌子的烟草，‘抽烟比吃东西爽多了！’皮聘说，所以最后就变成这个样子了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
