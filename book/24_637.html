<div class="line_en">"Yes," said Sullivan in reply to Jan's question. "We use standard aeronautical techniques, and most of these men are from the aircraft industry. It's hard to believe that a thing this size could be alive, isn't it? Or could throw itself clear out of the water, as I've seen them do."</div>

<div class="line_en">It was all very fascinating, but Jan had other things on his mind. His eyes were searching the giant skeleton to find a suitable hiding-place for his little cell -- the "air-conditioned coffin', as Sullivan had christened it. On one point he was Immediately reassured. As far as space was concerned, there would be room for a dozen stowaways.</div>

<div class="line_en">When Jan first saw it, he found it hard to realize that he was not watching the fuselage of a small airliner being assembled.

<div class="line_en">"We haven't the slightest intention of catching a whale. Anyway, they don't have skins in the usual sense of the word. It would hardly be practicable to fold a blanket of blubber twenty centimetres thick around that framework. No, the whole thing will be faked up with plastics and then accurately painted. By the time we've finished, no one will be able to tell the difference."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们从来没有想过要去捉鲸鱼。你说的那种表皮也根本不存在，要把鲸鱼身上二十厘米厚的油脂层铺到骨架上，是不可能的事！到时我们只要铺上一层塑料，涂上准确的颜色，这个模型就成了。等我们完成时，没人看得出有什么区别了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In that case, thought Jan, the sensible thing for the. Overlords to have done would be to take photographs and make the full-sized model themselves, back on their home planet. But perhaps their supply ships returned empty, and a little thing like a twenty-metre sperm whale would hardly be noticed. When one possessed such power and such resources, one could not be bothered with minor economies…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果这样，外星人为什么不拍下鲸鱼的照片，回去后，根据具体尺寸自己仿造一头呢？也许，外星人的飞船反正空着，放一头二十米长的虎头鲸这样的小东西根本没有任何问题，也不会在乎多这点运输费用…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Professor Sullivan stood by one of the great statues that had been such a challenge to archaeology since Easter Island was discovered. King, god or whatever it might be, its eyeless gaze seemed to be following his as he looked upon his handiwork. He was proud of what he had done: it seemed a pity that it would soon be banished forever from human sight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="东岛自从发现以来，那些神秘的塑像一直让考古学家们苦心琢磨。萨利文教授此时就站在一尊这样的塑像旁，不知它是国王、是神，还是其他什么？没有眼睛，却似乎一直追随着他的视线。萨利文低头看着鱿鱼模型，很满意，可惜很快就要被运走了，运到一个人类再也看不到的地方去了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The tableau might have been the work of some mad artist in a drugged delirium. Yet it was a painstaking copy from life: Nature herself was the artist here. The scene was one that, until the perfection of underwater television, few men had ever glimpsed -- and even then only for seconds on those rare occasions when the giant antagonists thrashed their way to the surface. These battles were fought in the endless night of the ocean depths, where the sperm whales hunted for their food. It was food that objected strongly to being eaten alive -- The long, saw-toothed lower jaw of the whale was gaping wide, preparing to fasten upon its prey. The creature's head was almost concealed beneath the writhing network of white, pulpy arms with which the giant squid was fighting desperately for life. Livid sucker-marks, twenty centimetres or more in diameter, had mottled the whale's skin where those arms had fastened. One tentacle was already a truncated stump, and there could be no doubt as to the ultimate outcome of the battle. When the two greatest beasts on earth engaged in combat, the whale was always the winner. For all the vast strength of its forest of tentacles, the squid's only hope lay in escaping before that patiently grinding jaw had sawn it to pieces. Its great expressionless eyes, half a metre across, stared at its destroyer -- though, in all probability, neither creature could see the other in the darkness of the abyss.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="整个模型似乎只有痴迷的艺术家在毒品的极度兴奋中才能想象出来，它是生命的再现，自然的杰作。水下摄像机还没有完善之前，几乎没有人看到过这样的场景，就算偶然看到也是鲸和鱿鱼打斗着冲上水面的短短几秒钟。这样的生死搏斗都在漆黑的深海进行…鲸鱼的下颚张得很大，露出锯齿状的牙齿，正准备撕咬猎物，头几乎被鱿鱼柔软的白色触角完全遮住，鱿鱼直径二十多厘米的青灰色吸盘牢牢抓住鲸的表皮，它的一只触角已经断了，结果显而易见。这种搏斗中，鲸通常是胜者，鱿鱼数目众多的触角虽然有力，但面对鲸，只能逃跑。鱿鱼直径五十厘米的眼睛，毫无生气地瞪着自己的毁灭者。实际上，在深海中，一片漆黑，它们根本看不见对方。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The entire exhibit was more than thirty metres long, and had now been surrounded by a cage of aluminium girders to which the lifting tackle had been connected. Everything was ready, awaiting the Overlords' pleasure. Sullivan hoped that they would act quickly: the suspense was beginning to be uncomfortable. Someone had come out of the office into the bright sunlight, obviously looking for him. Sullivan recognized his chief clerk, and walked over to meet him.</div>

<div class="line_en">"In your Bible," said Karellen, "there is a remarkable story of a Hebrew prophet, one Jonah, who was swallowed by a whale and thus carried safely to land after he had been cast from a ship. Do you think there could be any basis of fact in such a legend?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡瑞林说：“在你们的《圣经》里有一个很有名的故事，讲的是一个叫约拿的犹太信徒被扔下海后，被鲸鱼吞掉，最后安全回到陆地上的故事。这个故事有依据吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I believe," Sullivan replied cautiously, "that there is one fairly well-authenticated case of a whaleman being swallowed and then regurgitated with no ill-effects. Of course, if he had been inside the whale for more than a few seconds he would have suffocated. And he must have been very lucky to miss the teeth. It's an almost incredible story, but not quite impossible."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="萨利文谨慎地回答：“只有一个鲸人的故事被证实过。那个人被鲸吞进肚子里，马上又被吐了出来，毫发无伤。但如果他在里面待上几秒钟，就会窒息而死。再说他没有被鲸的牙齿咬伤，已经很幸运了。这个故事让人难以相信，但不能排除有这种可能。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the moonlight, that had transformed the frozen battle into a scene from a nightmare, Professor Sullivan walked slowly back to his office. He wondered what he had done, and where it would lead. But this, of course, he would never know. Jan might walk this spot again, having given no more than a few months of his life in travelling to the home of the Overlords and returning to Earth. Yet if he did so, it would be on the other side of Time's impassable barrier, for it would be eighty years in the future.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="月光下，那具模型就像噩梦中的场景。萨利文缓缓走回办公室，自己究竟干了些什么，结果会怎样，当然结果自己永远也不会知道。扬一趟往返只花几个月的时间，而地球上八十年已经过去了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Much good that will do me," said Sullivan gruffly. "I'll have been dead for years." To his surprise and mild consternation, for he was not a sentimental man, he discovered that this farewell was beginning to affect him. He had grown to like Jan during the weeks they had plotted together. Moreover, he had begun to fear he might be an accessory to a complicated suicide.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那能对我有多大好处？”萨利文的声音沙哑了，“那时我已经死了好多年了。”他不是个多愁善感的人，眼前的离别场面却开始影响自己的情绪了。在共同策划这件事的几周里，他已经喜欢上了这个小伙子，他害怕自己真的成为这个自杀事件的帮凶。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He steadied the ladder as Jan climbed into the great jaw, carefully avoiding the lines of teeth. By the light of the electric torch, he saw Jan turn and wave: then he was lost in the cavernous hollow. There was the sound of the airlock hatch being opened and closed, and, thereafter, silence.</div>

<div class="line_en">The lights went on in the tiny metal cylinder as soon as Jan had closed the inner door of the lock. He allowed himself no time for second thoughts, but began immediately upon the routine check he had already worked out. All the stores and provisions had been loaded days ago, but a final recheck would put him in the right frame of mind, by assuring him that nothing had been left undone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="扬关上里面的门，金属罩里的灯就自动亮了。他没有任何迟疑，马上开始作最后一次检查，所有的用品和供给几天前就装好了，再检查一遍可以更放心。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There would, however, be a considerable change of atmospheric pressure. This was unimportant, since the hollow models could "breathe" through several orifices. Before he left his cell, Jan would have to equalize pressure, and he had assumed that the atmosphere inside the Overlord ship was unbreathable. A simple face-mask and oxygen set would take care of that: there was no need for anything elaborate. If he could breathe without mechanical aid, so much the better. There was no point in waiting any longer: it would only be a strain on the nerves. He took out the little syringe, already loaded with the carefully prepared solution. Narcosamine had been discovered during research into animal hibernation: it was not true to say -- as was popularly believed -- that it produced suspended animation. All it caused was a great slowing-down of the vital processes, though metabolism still continued at a reduced level. It was as if one had banked up the fires of life, so that they smouldered underground. But when, after weeks or months, the effect of the drug wore off, they would burst out again and the sleeper would revive. Narcosamine was perfectly safe. Nature had used it for a million years to protect many of her children from the foodless winter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，气压将会发生很大变化，那不要紧，模型上有好些透气孔。自己离开这儿之前，把里外压力平衡一下就可以了。飞船里的空气恐怕不能呼吸，这样用一个简单的面罩和氧气设备就能解决，没必要太繁杂，如果能不用这些东西更好。再等也无益，白白折磨自己的神经，扬取出小小的针管，里面早已装好了精心配制的溶液。麻醉剂在研究动物冬眠时就发现了，一般人认为它能使活力延迟，这种说法不够准确。实际上它只是让人的各种生命活动大大放慢速度，各种新陈代谢仍在继续，只是维持在一个极低的水平，如同封上一个人生命的火炉后，火仍然在慢慢燃烧一样。几周之后，几个月之后，药力过去，生命之火又会熊熊燃烧，沉睡的人又醒来了。这种方法很安全，自然界里这种方法已经用了上千年，保护了无数自然界的孩子安然度过一个个没有食物的严冬。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">An hour later, he was satisfied. He lay back on the sponge-rubber couch and recapitulated his plans. The only sound was the faint whirr of the electric calendar dock, which would warn him when the voyage was coming to its end. He knew that he could expect to feel nothing here in his cell, for whatever tremendous forces drove the ships of the Overlords must be perfectly compensated. Sullivan had checked that, pointing out that his tableau would collapse if subjected to more than a few gravities. His -- clients -- had assured him that there was no danger on this score.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个小时后，他满意地躺在海绵橡胶床垫上，把计划重温了一遍。此时只有那只电子日历闹钟的声音还能听到，旅程快结束时，它将把自己从沉睡中唤醒。他很清楚自己在这里不会有任何特别的感觉。不管飞船驱动力有多大，都被平衡掉了，这一点卡瑞林证实过。萨利文说如果重力发生变化，模型就会倒塌，卡瑞林说不会有任何问题。">查看中文翻译</div>
