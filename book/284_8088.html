<div class="line_en">"Aye," said Martha with a cheerful grin. "Th' storm's over for a bit. It does like this at this' time o' th' year. It goes off in a night like it was pretendin' it had never been here an' never meant to come again. That's because th' springtime's on its way. It's a long way off yet, but it's comin'."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊哈，”玛莎咧嘴一笑说道，“暴雨得停上一段时间了。每年这个时候就是这样。雨停上一晚上，装得好像从来没来过，也不会再来了。这是因为春天已经在路上了。还有好长一段路呢，不过正在来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Two days after this, when Mary opened her eyes she sat upright in bed immediately, and called to Martha. "Look at the moor! Look at the moor!"</div>

<div class="line_en">The rainstorm had ended and the gray mist and clouds had been swept away in the night by the wind. The wind itself had ceased and a brilliant, deep blue sky arched high over the moorland. Never, never had Mary dreamed of a sky so blue. In India skies were hot and blazing. this was of a deep cool blue which almost seemed to sparkle like the waters of some lovely bottomless lake, and here and there, high, high in the arched blueness floated small clouds of snow-white fleece. The far-reaching world of the moor itself looked softly blue instead of gloomy purple-black or awful dreary gray.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="暴风雨停了，一夜的风扫净了灰色的雾霭和云翳。风也住了，一片明朗的深蓝色天空高高拱跨在原野之上。玛丽做梦都从来、从来没有见过这么蓝的天。在印度，天空火焰般灼热；而这种凉爽的深蓝，闪亮如一面无底的湖水。这里，那里，在高高拱着的蓝色里，飘浮着朵朵小云彩，像雪白的羊毛一样。牧尔上遥不可及的世界现在是温柔的蓝色，不再是阴郁的紫黑，或者凄凉得可怕的灰色。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Eh! no!" said Martha, sitting up on her heels among her black lead brushes. "Nowt o' th' soart!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢！不是！”玛莎说，在一堆黑色的铅刷子中间坐起来，“根罢是这响。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There now," she said. "I've talked broad Yorkshire again like Mrs. Medlock said I mustn't. 'Nowt o' th' soart' means 'nothin'-of-the-sort,' " slowly and carefully, "but it takes so long to say it. Yorkshire's th' sunniest place on earth when it is sunny. I told thee tha'd like th' moor after a bit. Just you wait till you see th' gold-colored gorse blossoms an' th' blossoms o' th' broom, an' th' heather flowerin', all purple bells, an' hundreds o' butterflies flutterin' an' bees hummin' an' skylarks soarin' up an' singin'. You'll want to get out on it at sunrise an' live out on it all day like Dickon does."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这样的，”她说，“我刚才讲的是宽扁的约克郡话，莫得劳克太太说我绝对不能讲的。‘根罢是这响’是说‘根本不是这样的，’”她慢慢地，小心地说，“可是这么说要说好久。约克郡天晴的时候，是世界上最晴朗的地方。我告诉过你，过些时候你会喜欢牧尔的。等你看到金色的金雀花，石楠花——全是紫色的铃铛，成百上千的蝴蝶拍着翅膀，蜜蜂嗡嗡着，百灵鸟一飞冲天，唱着歌。你会太阳一出来就想出去，像迪肯一样整天待在牧尔上。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What does that mean?" asked Mary seriously. In India the natives spoke different dialects which only a few people understood, so she was not surprised when Martha used words she did not know.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你说什么？”玛丽好奇地问。在印度，土著讲不同的方言，很少有人懂，所以玛莎的话她听不懂也不觉得惊奇。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'll ask my mother about it," she said. "She's one o' them that nearly always sees a way to do things. It's my day out today an' I'm goin' home. Eh! I am glad. Mrs. Medlock thinks a lot o' mother. Perhaps she could talk to her."</div>

<div class="line_en">Martha stared at her a moment curiously before she took up her polishing brush and began to rub the grate again. She was thinking that the small plain face did not look quite as sour at this moment as it had done the first morning she saw it. It looked just a trifle like little Susan Ann's when she wanted something very much.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛莎好奇地瞪着她看了一阵，然后拿起她的抛光刷子，重新开始磨壁炉架。她在想，刚才这张平板的小脸显得不像第一天早上她见到的那么酸溜溜。这张脸看着有那么一点点像小苏珊。安非常想要什么的时候。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She went away in high spirits as soon as she had given Mary her breakfast. She was going to walk five miles across the moor to the cottage, and she was going to help her mother with the washing and do the week's baking and enjoy herself thoroughly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她照料玛丽吃完早饭就走了，兴致很高。她要跨过五英里的牧尔，回到小屋，她要帮妈妈洗涮，帮她烘烤下一周的吃食，她要彻底享受、自得其乐。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Mother said that to me once," she said. "She was at her wash-tub an' I was in' a bad temper an' talkin' ill of folk, an' she turns round on me an' says: 'Tha' young vixen, tha'! There tha' stands sayin' tha' doesn't like this one an' tha' doesn't like that one. How does tha' like thysel'?' It made me laugh an' it brought me to my senses in a minute."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“有一次妈妈这样跟我说，”她说，“她在洗衣盆边上，我心情不好，说着别人的坏话，她回身来对我说：‘纳个小泼妇，纳！你就站在那儿，说你不喜欢这个，不喜欢那个。你喜欢你自己吗？’把我逗笑了，马上就让我清醒了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mary felt lonelier than ever when she knew she was no longer in the house. She went out into the garden as quickly as possible, and the first thing she did was to run round and round the fountain flower garden ten times. She counted the times carefully and when she had finished she felt in better spirits. The sunshine made the whole place look different. The high, deep, blue sky arched over Misselthwaite as well as over the moor, and she kept lifting her face and looking up into it, trying to imagine what it would be like to lie down on one of the little snow-white clouds and float about. She went into the first kitchen-garden and found Ben Weatherstaff working there with two other gardeners. The change in the weather seemed to have done him good. He spoke to her of his own accord. "Springtime's comin'," he said. "Cannot tha' smell it?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽知道她不在房子里以后，更加觉得孤单。她尽快出去赶到花园里，第一件事就是围绕带喷泉的花园跑上十圈。她认真数着圈数，完成以后觉得精神好些了。阳光让这地方整个变了。牧尔上的深蓝色高天也拱跨在米瑟韦斯特庄园之上，她不停地仰起脸来往深处望，想像着，躺在那些雪白的小云朵上四处飘会是什么样。她走进第一个菜园，看到季元本和另外两个花匠在干活。看来天气变化对他有好处。他主动和她说话：“春天来了，”他说，“你闻不到？”">查看中文翻译</div>

You'll see bits o'green spikes stickin' out o' th' black earth after a bit."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那是肥沃的好土，”他一边答话，一边挖，“它现在心情正好，准备长东西。播种的时候到了，它心里乐意。冬天它无事可干，就闷得很。那边花园里头，地底下的东西会暗中长。太阳把它们烤暖和了。过一下，你能看到一些绿色的尖芽冒出来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No. Everything is hot, and wet, and green after the rains in India," said Mary. "And I think things grow up in a night."</div>

<div class="line_en">She walked away, slowly thinking. She had begun to like the gardenjust as she had begun to like the robin and Dickon and Martha's mother. She was beginning to like Martha, too. That seemed a good many people to like -- when you were not used to liking. She thought of the robin as one of the people. She went to her walk outside the long, ivy-covered wall over which she could see the tree-tops; and the second time she walked up and down the most interesting and exciting thing happened to her, and it was all through Ben Weatherstaff's robin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她走开了，一边慢慢地想。她开始喜欢那个花园，就像她渐渐喜欢上了知更鸟、迪肯和玛莎的妈妈。她也开始喜欢玛莎了。看来让她喜欢的人有好些——要是你不习惯喜欢人的话。她觉得知更鸟是一个人。她到那道盖满常春藤的长墙外散步，越过墙顶她能看到树梢；她来回走第二趟的时候，一件极端有趣、激动人心的事情发生了，全都靠了季元本的知更鸟。">查看中文翻译</div>

His red waistcoat was like satin and he puffed his tiny breast out and was so fine and so grand and so pretty that it was really as if he were showing her how important and like a human person a robin could be. Mistress Mary forgot that she had ever been contrary in her life when he allowed her to draw closer and closer to him, and bend down and talk and try to make something like robin sounds.</div>

It was more than a ring, however; it was an old key which looked as if it had been buried a long time.</div>

<div class="line_en">The flower-bed was not quite bare. It was bare of flowers because the perennial plants had been cut down for their winter rest, but there were tall shrubs and low ones which grew together at the back of the bed, and as the robin hopped about under them she saw him hop over a small pile of freshly turned up earth. He stopped on it to look for a worm. The earth had been turned up because a dog had been trying to dig up a mole and he had scratched quite a deep hole.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="花床不完全是空白的。上面没有花，因为多年生的植物都割了过冬，但是花床往里还有高高矮矮的灌木丛，知更鸟在下面跳的时候，她看到它跳过一小堆新翻的泥土。它停下来找虫子。土被翻起来，因为有一只狗想挖出鼹鼠，抓出一个颇深的坑。">查看中文翻译</div>
