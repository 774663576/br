<div class="line_en">When we want to give expression to a dramatic situation in our lives, we tend to use metaphors of heaviness. We say that something has become a great burden to us. We either bear the burden or fail and go down with it, we struggle with it, win or lose. And Sabina -- what had come over her? Nothing. She had left a man because she felt like leaving him. Had he persecuted her? Had he tried to take revenge on her? No. Her drama was a drama not of heaviness but of lightness. What fell to her lot was not the burden but the unbearable lightness of being.</div>

<div class="line_en">After four years in Geneva, Sabina settled in Paris, but she could not escape her melancholy. If someone had asked her what had come over her, she would have been hard pressed to find words for it.</div>

<div class="line_en">Until that time, her betrayals had filled her with excitement and joy, because they opened up new paths to new adventures of betrayal. But what if the paths came to an end? One could betray one's parents, husband, country, love, but when parents husband, country, and love were gone -- what was left to betray?</div>

<div class="line_en">Naturally she had not realized it until now. How could she have? The goals we pursue are always veiled. A girl who longs for marriage longs for something she knows nothing about. The boy who hankers after fame has no idea what fame is. The thing that gives our every move its meaning is always totally unknown to us.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="直至此时，她显然仍未明了，这也是可以理解的：追求的终极永远是朦胧的。期盼嫁人的年轻女子期盼的是她完全不了解的东西。追逐荣誉的年轻人根本不识荣誉为何物。赋予我们的行为以意义的，我们往往对其全然不知。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Three years after moving to Paris, she received a letter from Prague. It was from Tomas's son. Somehow or other he had found out about her and got hold of her address, and now he was writing to her as his father's closest friend. He informed her of the deaths of Tomas and Tereza. For the past few years they had been living in a village, where Tomas was employed as a driver at a collective farm. From time to time they would drive over to the next town and spend the night in a cheap hotel. The road there wound through some hills, and their pickup had crashed and hurtled down a steep incline. Their bodies had been crushed to a pulp. The police determined later that the brakes were in disastrous condition.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在巴黎的第三年，她收到一封寄自波希米亚的信。是托马斯的儿子写来的一封信。他听说过她，打听到了地址，并决定给她写信，因为她曾是他父亲“最亲密的朋友”。他告诉她托马斯与特蕾莎都死了。据信上所说，他俩最后几年生活在一个小村庄里，托马斯在那儿当卡车司机。他们常常一块去附近的一个小城，总在一间小旅馆过夜。路在山间穿行，弯弯曲曲，卡车坠入了深谷。找到的尸体全是碎的。警方发现，卡车的刹车装置糟透了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She could not get over the news. The last link to her past had been broken.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="得知这一消息，她无法平静下来。她与过去之间的最后一丝联系也断了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Walking along a row of graves, she noticed people gathering for a burial. The funeral director had an armful of flowers and was giving one to each mourner. He handed one to Sabina as well. She joined the group. They made a detour past many monuments before they came to the grave, free for the moment of its heavy gravestone. She leaned over the hole. It was extremely deep. She dropped in the flower. It sailed down to the coffin in graceful somersaults. In Bohemia the graves were not so deep. In Paris the graves were deeper, just as the buildings were taller. Her eye fell on the stone, which lay next to the grave. It chilled her, and she hurried home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="走在公墓的一条小道上，她望见不远处有支葬礼队伍。司仪抱着满怀的鲜花，分发给死者的亲眷和朋友，一人一支。他递过来一支给萨比娜。她于是加入行列之中。绕过了好几座坟墓，来到了一个没有碑石的墓穴旁。她弯下身子。坑穴非常深。她抛出了那支花。花急急地旋转了几下，坠落在棺盖上。波希米亚的墓穴没有这么深的，而在巴黎，房子有多高，墓穴就有多深。她的目光落在墓穴一旁待封的石板上。这石板令她充满了恐惧，于是她匆匆赶回家。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">According to her old habit, she decided to calm herself by taking a walk in a cemetery. The Montparnasse Cemetery was the closest. It was all tiny houses, miniature chapels over each grave. Sabina could not understand why the dead would want to have imitation palaces built over them. The cemetery was vanity transmogrified into stone. Instead of growing more sensible in death, the inhabitants of the cemetery were sillier than they had been in life. Their monuments were meant to display how important they were. There were no fathers, brothers, sons, or grandmothers buried there, only public figures, the bearers of titles, degrees, and honors; even the postal clerk celebrated his chosen profession, his social significance -- his dignity.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="按她以往的习惯，她想去墓地走走以平息心情。最近的一座墓地是蒙巴纳斯公墓。墓地里是一座座石墓，墓旁是一座座脆弱的小石屋，小教堂。萨比娜不明白，为什么亡者会想让那些仿制的宫殿压在自己头上。这座公墓就是个石化的名利场。公墓里的众生根本没在死后变得清醒起来，反倒比生前更为痴癫。他们在铭碑上夸耀着自己的显赫。这儿安息的不是父亲、兄弟、儿子或祖母，而是名流、政要和头衔及荣誉加身的人物，哪怕只是个小职员，也要在此摆出他的身份、级别、社会地位——即他的尊严——供人瞻仰。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She answered herself: When graves are covered with stones, the dead can no longer get out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她给自己找了这样一个答案：如果坟墓被一块石板封住，亡者将永远不得出来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But the dead can't get out anyway! What difference does it make whether they're covered with soil or stones?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是，不管怎样，死人都不会从墓穴中出来！那么，他是躺在一层黏土之下还是一块石板之下，结果又有什么不同呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That made Sabina think about her father's grave. There was soil above his grave with flowers growing out of it and a maple tree reaching down to it, and the roots and flowers offered his corpse a path out of the grave. If her father had been covered with a stone, she would never have been able to communicate with him after he died, and hear his voice in the trees pardoning her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="萨比娜想起她父亲的坟墓。棺材上覆盖着泥土，泥土上开出花朵，一棵枫树的树根盘绕棺材而生，可以想象亡人的魂魄经由树根和花儿从坟墓之中超脱出来。假如她父亲被一块石板封死，她就不能在他过世后再向他倾诉，也不能再听到树的枝叶之中传来他宽恕的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What was it like in the cemetery where Tereza and Tomas were buried?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特蕾莎与托马斯安息的那座公墓会是什么样子呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Once more she started thinking about them. From time to time they would drive over to the next town and spend the night in a cheap hotel. That passage in the letter had caught her eye. It meant they were happy. And again she pictured Tomas as if he were one of her paintings: Don Juan in the foreground, a specious stage-set by a naive painter, and through a crack in the set -- Tristan. He died as Tristan, not as Don Juan. Sabina's parents had died in the same week. Tomas and Tereza in the same second. Suddenly she missed Franz terribly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她再度想起了他们两人。他们时常去邻近的城里并留在旅馆过夜。信中的这一段触动了她。这证明他们是幸福的。她又看见了托马斯，仿佛是她的一幅画：前景是由一位稚拙的画家画出的幻影——唐璜；而从幻影的缝隙里，现出了特里斯丹。他死时是特里斯丹，而不是唐璜。萨比娜的父母在同一周相继去世。托马斯与特蕾莎则死在同一刻。突然间，她恨不得和弗兰茨呆在一起。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The difference is that if a grave is covered with a stone it means we don't want the deceased to come back. The heavy stone tells the deceased, Stay where you are!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不，结果有所不同：假如坟墓用一块石板封住，也就是不愿让亡者还魂。那沉重的石板对他说：“待在这儿别动！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Perhaps if they had stayed together longer, Sabina and Franz would have begun to understand the words they used. Gradually, timorously, their vocabularies would have come together, like bashful lovers, and the music of one would have begun to intersect with the music of the other. But it was too late now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="假如他们相处的时间更长一些，也许他们就会渐渐地开始理解彼此说的话。他们的言语会像非常腼腆的情人一样，羞涩地慢慢相互靠近，而他们的乐章会开始与对方的融为一体。可为时已晚。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yes, it was too late, and Sabina knew she would leave Paris, move on, and on again, because were she to die here they would cover her up with a stone, and in the mind of a woman for whom no place is home the thought of an end to all flight is unbearable.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="是的，为时已晚。萨比娜知道自己不会停留在巴黎，她会越走越远，因为，如果她死在这儿，她会被一块石板封住，对于一个永不知停息的女人来说，一想到要被永远禁锢，不再能行走，那是无法忍受的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When she told him about her cemetery walks, he gave a shiver of disgust and called cemeteries bone and stone dumps. A gulf of misunderstanding had immediately opened between them. Not until that day at the Montparnasse Cemetery did she see what he meant. She was sorry to have been so impatient with him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当她跟他说起她常在墓地里行走时，他曾感到恶心，并把墓地比作堆放尸骸和乱石的垃圾场。正是在那一天，他们之间裂开了一道互不理解的鸿沟。直到今天，在蒙巴纳斯公墓，她才明白了他想说的意思。她悔恨当初太不耐心。">查看中文翻译</div>
