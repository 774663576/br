<div class="line_en">He sat up painfully. Looking into the valley he could see no living goblins. After a while as his head cleared a little, he thought he could see elves moving in the rocks below. He rubbed his eyes. Surely there was a camp still in the plain some distance off; and there was a coming and going about the Gate? Dwarves seemed to be busy removing the wall. But all was deadly still. There was no call and no echo of a song. Sorrow seemed to be in the air.</div>

<div class="line_en">The man was swift and sure-footed. It was not long before Bilbo was set down before a tent in Dale; and there stood Gandalf, with his arm in a sling. Even the wizard had not escaped without a wound; and there were few unharmed in all the host.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then Bilbo turned away, and he went by himself, and sat alone wrapped in a blanket, and, whether you believe it or not, he wept until his eyes were red and his voice was hoarse. He was a kindly little soul. Indeed it was long before he had the heart to make a joke again. "A mercy it is," he said at last to himself, "that I woke up when I did. I wish Thorin were living, but I am glad that we parted in kindness. You are a fool, Bilbo Baggins, and you made a great mess of that business with the stone; and there was a battle, in spite of all your efforts to buy peace and quiet, but I suppose you can hardly be blamed for that."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="比尔博黯然转身离开，裹着毯子独自坐下来。不管你相不相信，比尔博就这么哭啊哭，一直哭到眼睛红肿，嗓子沙哑。他是个心地非常善良的小家伙，事实上，他从悲痛中恢复，再次和人开起玩笑来已经是许久以后的事情了。“我能够在那时醒来，”他对自己说，“也算得是老天的一种慈悲。我固然希望索林还活着，但我们能像这样捐弃前嫌，让他了无遗憾地离开，是件很值得高兴的事情。比尔博·巴金斯，你可真是个笨蛋，在宝石那件事上惹出这么大的麻烦，还弄出一场大战来，虽然你努力想要买到和平与安宁，不过我想这也不能怪在你头上。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Bilbo knelt on one knee filled with sorrow. "Farewell, King under the Mountain!" he said. "This is a bitter adventure, if it must end so; and not a mountain of gold can amend it.

<div class="line_cn" title="“不！”索林说，“来自民风厚朴的西部的好孩子啊，你身上的优点比你自己知道的还多。你智勇兼备，融合得恰到好处。如果我们都能把食物和笑语欢歌看得比黄金宝藏还重，世界将会比现在快乐许多。可不管这个世界未来是喜是悲，我现在都得离开了。永别了！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">All that had happened after he was stunned, Bilbo learned later; but it gave him more sorrow than joy, and he was now weary of his adventure. He was aching in his bones for the homeward journey. That, however, was a little delayed, so in the meantime I will tell something of events. The Eagles had long had suspicion of the goblins' mustering; from their watchfulness the movements in the mountains could not be altogether hid. So they too had gathered in great numbers, under the great Eagle of the Misty Mountains; and at length smelling battle from afar they had come speeding down the gale in the nick of time. They it was who dislodged the goblins from the mountain-slopes, casting them over precipices, or driving them down shrieking and bewildered among their foes. It was not long before they had freed the Lonely Mountain, and elves and men on either side of the valley could come at last to the help of the battle below.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在他被打昏之后发生了什么事情，比尔博是后来才知道的。但这给他带来的更多是伤悲，而不是欢愉，弄得他对冒险产生了厌倦，变得归心似箭起来。不过，那还得要再过一阵子，所以我还来得及把详情跟你们讲一讲。大鹰们早就怀疑半兽人可能在暗中集结，因为山里面的那些秘密活动并不能完全躲过大鹰的监视。因此，它们也在迷雾山脉的鹰王号召下集合了大军，在终于嗅到开战的气氛后，就立刻于千钧一发之际顺风飞了过来。它们在山坡上驱赶半兽人，让他们摔下悬崖，或是追得他们嗷嗷直叫，还纳闷为什么大鹰只追他们而不追他们的敌人。不久之后，他们就收复了整个孤山，令两边山坡上的精灵和人类终于可以合力来支援下面山谷中的战斗。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But even with the Eagles they were still outnumbered. In that last hour Beorn himself had appeared-no one knew how or from where. He came alone, and in bear's shape; and he seemed to have grown almost to giant-size in his wrath.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，即使在加上了大鹰之后，他们在数量上仍处于劣势。在最后一刻，贝奥恩出现了——没有人知道他是从何而来，又是如何而来的。他孤身一人以熊的外形出现。在冲天的怒气中，他的身形俨然变得如巨人般高大魁伟。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The roar of his voice was like drums and guns; and he tossed wolves and goblins from his path like straws and feathers. He fell upon their rear, and broke like a clap of thunder through the ring. The dwarves were making a stand still about their lords upon a low rounded hill. Then Beorn stooped and lifted Thorin, who had fallen pierced with spears, and bore him out of the fray.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的怒吼如同战鼓和火铳一般惊天动地，他把所经道路上的半兽人和恶狼随手抓起丢弃，仿佛他们都只是稻草和羽毛。他从敌阵后方突然出现，像一记奔雷般炸进战团中央。矮人们依旧将他们的国王团团护住在一座小圆山丘上。这时贝奥恩冲进来，弯下腰扛起了已经被好几支长矛刺穿了的索林，将他带离了战场。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Swiftly he returned and his wrath was redoubled, so that nothing could withstand him, and no weapon seemed to bite upon him. He scattered the bodyguard, and pulled down Bolg himself and crushed him. Then dismay fell on the Goblins and they fled in all directions. But weariness left their enemies with the coming of new hope, and they pursued them closely, and prevented most of them from escaping where they could. They drove many of them into the Running River, and such as fled south or west they hunted into the marshes about the Forest River; and there the greater part of the last fugitives perished, while those that came hardly to the Wood-elves' realm were there slain, or drawn in to die deep in the trackless dark of Mirkwood. Songs have said that three parts of the goblin warriors of the North perished on that day, and the mountains had peace for many a year.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他很快就重新杀了回来，满腔怒火更胜之前，这时的他已经无人可挡，也似乎没有什么武器能伤到他了。他将半兽人王的贴身卫队冲散，将波尔格一把抓过扯成两半，接着摔成了一团肉泥。半兽人眼见主帅被杀，吓得魂飞魄散，顿作鸟兽散去。而他们的敌人则随着希望的到来，身上平添一股力量，对他们紧追不舍，没有让他们抛掉。他们将许多半兽人赶进了奔流河，而对于那些逃往南面或西面的半兽人，他们一路将他们赶进了密林河周边的沼泽地里。这批最后的穷寇大部分都死在了沼泽里，极少数命大的好不容易跑进了森林精灵们的地盘，结果不是被精灵们杀死，就是被引入幽暗而又没有路径的黑森林，全都死在了里面。据日后流传的歌谣称，来自北方三个不同地区的半兽人战士都在那一天死绝了，这一带山区由此享有了许多年的和平。">查看中文翻译</div>

It is said in songs that it gleamed ever in the dark if foes approached, and the fortress of the dwarves could not be taken by surprise. There now Dain son of Nain took up his abode, and he became King under the Mountain, and in time many other dwarves gathered to his throne in the ancient halls. Of the twelve companions of Thorin, ten remained. Fili and Kili had fallen defending him with shield and body, for he was their mother's elder brother. The others remained with Dain; for Dain dealt his treasure well.</div>

<div class="line_en">The elf-host was on the march; and if it was sadly lessened, yet many were glad, for now the northern world would be merrier for many a long day. The dragon was dead, and the goblins overthrown, and their hearts looked forward after winter to a spring of joy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="精灵的部队正在行军，虽然人数减少许多令人心痛，但队伍中的许多人依旧欢欣鼓舞，因为，北方世界将有很长一段日子要比以前祥和许多了。恶龙死了，半兽人的割据被推翻，他们的心期盼着寒冬之后会有一个充满欢愉的春天。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Gandalf and Bilbo rode behind the Elvenking, and beside them strode Beorn, once again in man's shape, and he laughed and sang in a loud voice upon the road. So they went on until they drew near to the borders of Mirkwood, to the north of the place where the Forest River ran out. Then they halted, for the wizard and Bilbo would not enter the wood, even though the king bade them stay a while in his halls. They intended to go along the edge of the forest, and round its northern end in the waste that lay between it and the beginning of the Grey Mountains. It was a long and cheerless road, but now that the goblins were crushed, it seemed safer to them than the dreadful pathways under the trees. Moreover Beorn was going that way too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="甘道夫和比尔博骑在精灵国王后面，在他们身边大步走着的是恢复人形的贝奥恩，一路上他都在朗声大笑，引吭高歌。他们就这样一路走到了黑森林的北部边境，也就是密林河流出的地方。他们在那边停了下来，因为甘道夫和比尔博不愿意进入森林，尽管精灵国王邀请他们到自己的宫殿中去做客。他们准备沿着森林的边缘走，绕过它的北端，横跨灰色山脉和黑森林之间的荒原。这条路比较遥远，走起来也乏味，但既然现在半兽人已经被铲除，它似乎比树林中那些可怕的小径要更安全些。而且，贝奥恩也准备走这条路。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He had many hardships and adventures before he got back. The Wild was still the Wild, and there were many other things in it in those days beside goblins; but he was well guided and well guarded-the wizard was with him, and Beorn for much of the way-and he was never in great danger again. Anyway by midwinter Gandalf and Bilbo had come all the way back, along both edges of the Forest, to the doors of Beorn's house; and there for a while they both stayed. Yule-tide was warm and merry there; and men came from far and wide to feast at Beorn's bidding. The goblins of the Misty Mountains were now few and terrified, and hidden in the deepest holes they could find; and the Wargs had vanished from the woods, so that men went abroad without fear. Beorn indeed became a great chief afterwards in those regions and ruled a wide land between the mountains and the wood; and it is said that for many generations the men of his line had the power of taking bear's shape, and some were grim men and bad, but most were in heart like Beorn, if less in size and strength. In their day the last goblins were hunted from the Misty Mountains and a new peace came over the edge of the Wild.</div>

<div class="line_en">At last they came up the long road, and reached the very pass where the goblins had captured them before. But they came to that high point at morning, and looking backward they saw a white sun shining over the outstretched lands. There behind lay Mirkwood, blue in the distance, and darkly green at the nearer edge even in the spring. There far away was the Lonely Mountain on the edge of eyesight. On its highest peak snow yet unmelted was gleaming pale.</div>
