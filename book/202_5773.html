<div class="line_en">He looked around; the landing of number four, Privet Drive, was deserted. Possibly the cup of tea was Dudley's idea of a clever booby trap. Keeping his bleeding hand elevated, Harry scraped the fragments of cup together with the other hand and threw them into the already crammed bin just visible inside his bedroom door. Then he tramped across to the bathroom to run his finger under the tap.</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry was bleeding. Clutching his right hand in his left and swearing under his breath, he shouldered open his bedroom door. There was a crunch of breaking china: He had trodden on a cup of cold tea that had been sitting on the floor outside his bedroom door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利在流血。他左手捏住右手，嘴里不出声地骂着，用肩膀推开卧室的门。脚下突然发出瓷器碎裂的嘎吱声：一杯凉茶放在他卧室门外的地上，他一脚踩了上去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was stupid, pointless, irritating beyond belief that he still had four days left of being unable to perform magic… but he had to admit to himself that this jagged cut in his finger would have defeated him. He had never learned how to repair wounds, and now he came to think of it -- particularly in light of his immediate plans -- this seemed a serious flaw in his magical education. Making a mental note to ask Hermione how it was done, he used a large wad of toilet paper to mop up as much of the tea as he could, before returning to his bedroom and slamming the door behind him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="还有四天不能使用魔法，这真是愚蠢，毫无道理，令人恼火……但他不得不承认，手指上这个深深的伤口肯定使他不能得心应手。他从来没学会怎样修复创伤，现在想来——特别是想到他的下一步计划——这似乎是他魔法教育中的一个严重缺陷。他一边暗自决定下次向赫敏请教这个问题，一边拿一大团手纸尽量擦去地板上的茶渍，然后回到卧室，重重地关上了房门。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He now proceeded a little more cautiously. Kneeling down beside the trunk again, he groped around in the bottom and, after retrieving an old badge that flickered feebly between SUPPORT CEDRIC DIGGORY and POTTER STINKS, a cracked and worn-out Sneakoscope, and a gold locket inside which a note signed R. A. B. had been hidden, he finally discovered the sharp edge that had done the damage. He recognized it at once. It was a two-inch-long fragment of the enchanted mirror that his dead godfather, Sirius, had given him. Harry laid it aside and felt cautiously around the trunk for the rest, but nothing more remained of his godfather's last gift except powdered glass, which clung to the deepest layer of debris like glittering grit.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在他的动作比较谨慎了。他重新跪在箱子旁边，在箱底小心摸索着，掏出一个破旧的徽章，上面交替闪烁着支持塞德里克·迪戈里和波特臭大粪的淡淡字样；接着他又掏出一个破旧开裂的窥镜和一个金挂坠盒，盒里藏着一张签名为R.A。B。的字条，最后发现了划伤他手指的利刃。他立刻认了出来，那是已故教父小天狼星送给他的魔镜碎片，有两英寸长。哈利把它放在一边，小心翼翼地在箱子里寻找其他残片，可是教父的最后一件礼物只剩下了星星点点的玻璃碎屑，粘在箱子的最底层，像亮晶晶的粗砂粒。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry had spent the morning completely emptying his school trunk for the first time since he had packed it six years ago. At the start of the intervening school years, he had merely skimmed off the topmost three quarters of the contents and replaced or updated them, leaving a layer of general debris at the bottom -- old quills, desiccated beetle eyes, single socks that no longer fit. Minutes previously, Harry had plunged his hand into this mulch, experienced a stabbing pain in the fourth finger of his right hand, and withdrawn it to see a lot of blood.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="早上，哈利彻底清空了他上学用的箱子，这是他六年前装箱以来的第一次。以前每次开学，他都是把箱子上面四分之三的东西替换、更新一下，箱底一直留着一层乱七八糟的杂物——旧的羽毛笔，枯干的甲虫眼睛，早已穿不下的配不成对的袜子。几分钟前，哈利把手伸进这层杂物，右手的无名指突然一阵钻心的剧痛，抽出来一看，已经血流如注。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It took another hour to empty it completely, throw away the useless items, and sort the remainder in piles according to whether or not he would need them from now on. His school and Quidditch robes, cauldron, parchment, quills, and most of his textbooks were piled in a corner, to be left behind. He wondered what his aunt and uncle would do with them; burn them in the dead of night, probably, as if they were the evidence of some dreadful CRIme. His Muggle clothing, Invisibility Cloak, potion-making kit, certain books, the photograph album Hagrid had once given him, a stack of letters, and his wand had been repacked into an old rucksack. In a front pocket were the Marauder's Map and the locket with the note signed R. A. B. inside it. The locket was accorded this place of honor not because it was valuable -- in all usual senses it was worthless -- but because of what it had cost to attain it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他又花了一小时才把箱子彻底清空，扔掉没用的东西，剩下的根据以后是否需要分成了几堆。学院长袍、魁地奇队袍、坩埚、羊皮纸、羽毛笔以及大多数课本都堆在一个墙角，留在家里。不知道姨妈姨父给怎么处理它们，没准是半夜三更一把火烧掉，就好像它们是某种滔天大罪的证据。他的麻瓜衣服、隐形衣、配制魔药的用具、几本书，还有海格以前送给他的那本相册、一沓信件和魔杖则放进了一只旧背包里。背包的前兜里塞着活点地图和装着R.A。B。签名字条的金挂坠盒。把挂坠盒放在这么重要的位置，不是因为它有多么珍贵——按常理说，它毫无价值——而是因为获取它所付出的代价。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry sat up and examined the jagged piece on which he had cut himself, seeing nothing but his own bright green eye reflected back at him. Then he placed the fragment on top of that morning's Daily Prophet, which lay unread on the bed, and attempted to stem the sudden upsurge of bitter memories, the stabs of regret and of longing the discovery of the broken mirror had occasioned, by attacking the rest of the rubbish in the trunk.</div>

<div class="line_en">I met Albus Dumbledore at the age of eleven, on our first day at Hogwarts. Our mutual attraction was undoubtedly due to the fact that we both felt ourselves to be outsiders. I had contracted dragon pox shortly before arriving at school, and while I was no longer contagious, my pockmarked visage and greenish hue did not encourage many to approach me. For his part, Albus had arrived at Hogwarts under the burden of unwanted notoriety. Scarcely a year previously, his father, Percival, had been convicted of a savage and well-publicized attack upon three young Muggles.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我是进入霍格沃茨的那天认识阿不思·邓布利多的，当时我十一岁。我们之所以相互吸引，无疑是因为我们都觉得自己是局外人。我入学前不久染上了龙痘疮，虽然不再传染，但我满脸痘疮，肤色发青，没有多少人愿意接近我。阿不思呢，他是顶着恶名的压力来到霍格沃茨的。就在不到一年前，他父亲珀西瓦尔凶残地袭击了三个年轻麻瓜，事情闹得沸沸扬扬。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Albus never attempted to deny that his father (who was to die in Azkaban) had committed this CRIme; on the contrary, when I plucked up courage to ask him, he assured me that he knew his father to be guilty. Beyond that, Dumbledore refused to speak of the sad business, though many attempted to make him do so. Some, indeed, were disposed to praise his father's action and assumed that Albus too was a Muggle-hater. They could not have been more mistaken: As anybody who knew Albus would attest, he never revealed the remotest anti-Muggle tendency. Indeed, his determined support for Muggle rights gained him many enemies in subsequent years.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿不思从不试图否认他父亲（在阿兹卡班终身监禁）犯有这桩罪行。相反，当我鼓起勇气问他时，他向我明确表示他知道父亲有罪。除此之外，邓布利多拒绝谈论这件令人伤心的事，虽然有许多人想套他的话，有人甚至津津乐道地赞扬他父亲的行为，并断定阿不思也是个仇视麻瓜的人。但是他们大错特错了。凡是认识阿不思的人都可以证明，他从未表露过丝毫反麻瓜倾向。事实上，他日后坚决维护麻瓜权益的做法为他树敌不少。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In a matter of months, however, Albus's own fame had begun to eclipse that of his father. By the end of his first year he would never again be known as the son of a Muggle-hater, but as nothing more or less than the most brilliant student ever seen at the school. Those of us who were privileged to be his friends benefited from his example, not to mention his help and encouragement, with which he was always generous. He confessed to me in later life that he knew even then that his greatest pleasure lay in teaching.</div>

<div class="line_en">Three years after we had started at Hogwarts, Albus's brother, Aberforth, arrived at school. They were not alike; Aberforth was never bookish and, unlike Albus, preferred to settle arguments by dueling rather than through reasoned discussion. However, it is quite wrong to suggest, as some have, that the brothers were not friends. They rubbed along as comfortably as two such different boys could do. In fairness to Aberforth, it must be admitted that living in Albus's shadow cannot have been an altogether comfortable experience. Being continually outshone was an occupational hazard of being his friend and cannot have been any more pleasurable as a brother.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们入学三年后，阿不思的弟弟阿不福思也来到了霍格沃茨。兄弟两个不像。阿不福思从来不爱读书，而且，他喜欢决斗，不喜欢通过理性来协商来解决问题，这点也不像阿不思。不过，有人说兄弟俩关系不好。这也不符合事实。他们虽然性格迥异，相处还算和睦。替阿不福思说句公道话，必须承认生活在阿不思的阴影里不是件特别舒服的事。作为他的朋友，总是被他比得黯然失色，实在有伤士气；作为一个弟弟，肯定也不会愉快多少。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He not only won every prize of note that the school offered, he was soon in regular correspondence with the most notable magical names of the day, including Nicolas Flamel, the celebrated alchemist; Bathilda Bagshot, the noted historian; and Adalbert Waffling, the magical theoretician. Several of his papers found their way into learned publications such as Transfiguration Today, Challenges in Charming, and The Practical Potioneer. Dumbledore's future career seemed likely to be meteoric, and the only question that remained was when he would become Minister of Magic. Though it was often predicted in later years that he was on the point of taking the job, however, he never had Ministerial ambitions.</div>

<div class="line_en">When Albus and I left Hogwarts we intended to take the then-traditional tour of the world together, visiting and observing foreign wizards, before pursuing our separate careers. However, tragedy intervened. On the very eve of our trip, Albus's mother, Kendra, died, leaving Albus the head, and sole breadwinner, of the family. I postponed my departure long enough to pay my respects at Kendra's funeral, then left for what was now to be a solitary journey. With a younger brother and sister to care for, and little gold left to them, there could no longer be any question of Albus accompanying me.</div>

<div class="line_en">That was the period of our lives when we had least contact. I wrote to Albus, desCRIbing, perhaps insensitively, the wonders of my journey, from narrow escapes from chimaeras in Greece to the experiments of the Egyptian alchemists. His letters told me little of his day-to-day life, which I guessed to be frustratingly dull for such a brilliant wizard. Immersed in my own experiences, it was with horror that I heard, toward the end of my year's travels, that yet another tragedy had struck the Dumbledores: the death of his sister, Ariana.</div>

<div class="line_en">I returned home to find a young man who had experienced a much older person's suffering. Albus was more reserved than before, and much less lighthearted. To add to his misery, the loss of Ariana had led, not to a renewed closeness between Albus and Aberforth, but to an estrangement. (In time this would lift -- in later years they reestablished, if not a close relationship, then certainly a cordial one.) However, he rarely spoke of his parents or of Ariana from then on, and his friends learned not to mention them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我回国后，看到的是一个年轻人经历了与他的年龄不相称的老人的痛苦。阿不思比以前更加沉默寡言，心情也沉重许多。更令他痛苦的是，阿利安娜的死不仅没有使阿不思和阿不福思的关系更加紧密，反而使他们变得疏远了。（这种疏远逐渐改善——后来他们重新建立了关系，即使不算亲密，无疑还算友好。）然而，从那以后，阿不思很少谈及他的父母和阿利安娜，他的朋友们也避免谈论他们。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Though Ariana had been in poor health for a long time, the blow, coming so soon after the loss of their mother, had a profound effect on both of her brothers.

<div class="line_cn" title="虽说阿利安娜长期体弱多病，但母亲刚去世不久又遭此打击，阿利安娜的两个哥哥久久难以释怀。所有与阿不思亲近的人——我自己也有幸算在内——一致认为，阿利安娜的死，以及阿不思觉得自己对此事所负的责任（当然了，他实际上并无罪责），成为他终生无法摆脱的阴影。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Other quills will describe the triumphs of the following years. Dumbledore's innumerable contributions to the store of Wizarding knowledge, including his discovery of the twelve uses of dragon's blood, will benefit generations to come, as will the wisdom he displayed in the many judgments he made while Chief Warlock of the Wizengamot. They say, still, that no Wizarding duel ever matched that between Dumbledore and Grindelwald in 1945. Those who witnessed it have written of the terror and the awe they felt as they watched these two extraordinary wizards do battle. Dumbledore's triumph, and its consequences for the Wizarding world, are considered a turning point in magical history to match the introduction of the International Statute of Secrecy or the downfall of He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named.</div>

I shall miss his friendship more than I can say, but my loss is as nothing compared to the Wizarding world's. That he was the most inspiring and the best loved of all Hogwarts headmasters cannot be in question.
