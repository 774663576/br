<div class="line_en">It was raining again the next morning, a slanting gray rain like a swung curtain of crystal beads. I got up feeling sluggish and tired and stood looking out of the windows, with a dark harsh taste of Sternwoods still in my mouth. I was as empty of life as a scarecrow's pockets. I went out to the kitchenette and drank two cups of black coffee. You can have a hangover from other things than alcohol. I had one from women. Women made me sick.</div>

<div class="line_en">I shaved and showered and dressed and got my raincoat out and went downstairs and looked out of the front door. Across the street, a hundred feet up, a gray Plymouth sedan was parked. It was the same one that had tried to trail me around the day before, the same one that I had asked Eddie Mars about. There might be a cop in it, if a cop had that much time on his hands and wanted to waste it following me around. Or it might be a smoothie in the detective business trying to get a noseful of somebody else's case in order to chisel a way into it. Or it might be the Bishop of Bermuda disapproving of my night life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我刮了脸冲了澡，穿好衣服，翻出雨披，下楼朝门外望去。街对面，往北一百英尺的地方，停着一辆灰色的普利茅斯轿车。就是前一天试图跟踪我的那辆，也就是我向艾迪·马尔斯打听的那辆。车里也许是警察，如果一个警察手上有大把时间，并且愿意浪费来盯我的梢的话。也可能是某个侦探界的滑头，为了插上一脚别人的案子，正设法打探情报。也可能是百慕大主教，专程来批评我的夜生活。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A small bright-eyed man was pressed back into the corner behind the wheel. I stood and looked in at him, the rain thumping my back. His eyes blinked behind the swirling smoke of a cigarette. His hands tapped restlessly on the thin wheel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个眸子亮闪闪的小个男人缩在驾驶座的角上。我站在那儿探头看他，雨点重重拍打着我的背。他的眼睛在盘旋的烟雾后面眨了眨。他的手不安地在纤细的方向盘上拍着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I went out back and got my convertible from the garage and drove it around front past the gray Plymouth. There was a small man in it, alone. He started up after me. He worked better in the rain. He stayed close enough so that I couldn't make a short block and leave that before he entered it, and he stayed back far enough so that other cars were between us most of the time. I drove down to the boulevard and parked in the lot next to my building and came out of there with my raincoat collar up and my hat brim low and the raindrops tapping icily at my face in between. The Plymouth was across the way at a fire-plug. I walked down to the intersection and crossed with the green light and walked back, close to the edge of the sidewalk and the parked cars. The Plymouth hadn't moved. Nobody got out of it. I reached it and jerked open the door on the curb side.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我出门到后面的车库里取了车，绕道楼前经过那辆普利茅斯。里面独自坐着个小个男人。他发动汽车跟上来。看来他比较擅长开雨路。他靠得足够近，碰上短的街区我还没开出去他已经跟上来了；他又离得足够远，多数时间我俩之间总有其他车子。我一路开到大道，在我办公楼旁的停车场停了车，走出来时，我的雨衣领子竖得很高，帽檐压得很低，冰凉的雨水拍打着两者之间的我的脸。那辆普利茅斯车停在路对面的消防栓前。我走到十字路口，等绿灯亮了穿过去又踅回来，靠近人行道和停泊的车辆。那辆车没动。没人下车。我走上前，猛地拉开它靠人行道一边的车门。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I left him blinking and walked away. Twenty minutes later I was airing the scrubwoman's Soirée d'Amour out of my office and opening up a thick rough envelope addressed in a fine old-fashioned pointed handwriting. The envelope contained a brief formal note and a large mauve check for five hundred dollars, payable to Philip Marlowe and signed, Guy de Brisay Sternwood, by Vincent Norris. That made it a nice morning. I was making out a bank slip when the buzzer told me somebody had entered my two by four reception room. It was the little man from the Plymouth.</div>

<div class="line_en">He slid past me carefully as I held the door, as carefully as though he feared I might plant a kick in his minute buttocks. We sat down and faced each other across the desk. He was a very small man, not more than five feet three and would hardly weigh as much as a butcher's thumb. He had tight brilliant eyes that wanted to look hard, and looked as hard as oysters on the half shell. He wore a double-breasted dark gray suit that was too wide in the shoulders and had too much lapel. Over this, open, an Irish tweed coat with some badly worn spots. A lot of foulard tie bulged out and was rainspotted above his crossed lapels.</div>

Then she changed her name to Mars. Rusty got sore and married a rich dame that hung around the joints like she couldn't sleep well at home. You know all about her, tall, dark, enough looks for a Derby winner, but the type would put a lot of pressure on a guy. High-strung. Rusty wouldn't get along with her. But Jesus, he'd get along with her old man's dough, wouldn't he? That's what you think. This Regan was a cockeyed sort of buzzard. He had long-range eyes. He was looking over into the next valley all the time. He wasn't scarcely around where he was. I don't think he gave a damn about dough. And coming from me, brother, that's a compliment."</div>

When Mars don't need him he don't go near him. And he don't stay in L. A. Well it might be something and it might not. Maybe they got a line on Regan and Mars has just been sitting back with a smile on his puss, waiting for the chance. Then again it might be something else entirely. Anyway I tell Joe and Joe gets on Canino's tail. He can tail. Me, I'm no good at it. I'm giving that one away. No charge. And Joe tails Canino out to the Sternwood place and Canino parks outside the estate and a car come up beside him with a girl in it. They talk for a while and Joe thinks the girl passes something over, like maybe dough. The girl beats it. It's Regan's wife. Okey, she knows Canino and Canino knows Mars. So Joe figures Canino knows something about Regan and is trying to squeeze a little on the side for himself. Canino blows and Joe loses him. End of Act One."</div>
