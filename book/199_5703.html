<div class="line_en">Harry returned to Gryffindor Tower the following evening. From what Hermione and Ron told him, Dumbledore had spoken to the school that morning at breakfast. He had merely requested that they leave Harry alone, that nobody ask him questions or badger him to tell the story of what had happened in the maze. Most people, he noticed, were skirting him in the corridors, avoiding his eyes. Some whispered behind their hands as he passed. He guessed that many of them had believed Rita Skeeter's article about how disturbed and possibly dangerous he was. Perhaps they were formulating their own theories about how Cedric had died. He found he didn't care very much. He liked it best when he was with Ron and Hermione and they were talking about other things, or else letting him sit in silence while they played chess. He felt as though all three of them had reached an understanding they didn't need to put into words; that each was waiting for some sign, some word, of what was going on outside Hogwarts -- and that it was useless to speculate about what might be coming until they knew anything for certain. The only time they touched upon the subject was when Ron told Harry about a meeting Mrs. Weasley had had with Dumbledore before going home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天晚上，哈利回到了格兰芬多塔楼。据赫敏和罗恩说，邓布利多那天早上吃早饭时对全校师生讲了几句话。他只是要求大家别去打扰哈利，不许任何人问他问题，或缠着他讲述那天在迷宫里发生的事情。哈利注意到，大多数人在走廊里都绕着他走，避开他的目光。有些人在他走过时用手捂着嘴，互相窃窃私语。他猜想，他们许多人都相信了丽塔·斯基特的文章，认为他心理不正常，很可能是个危险人物。也许，对于塞德里克是怎么死的，许多人都有自己的想法。但哈利发现他并不怎么在乎。他最喜欢跟罗恩和赫敏在一起，谈论其他话题，或者他们俩自己下棋，让他一个人静静地坐着。他觉得他们三个似乎已达到了一种默契，已不需要用语言来表达；他们每个人都在等待某种信号或只言片语，告诉他们霍格沃茨外面发生的事情——在没有得到确切消息之前，对未来作种种盘算都是毫无用处的。他们只有一次触及到这个话题，那是罗恩对哈利讲述韦斯莱夫人回家前与邓布利多见面的经过。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Madame Maxime was still there. She was sitting next to Hagrid. They were talking quietly together. Further along the table, sitting next to Professor McGonagall, was Snape. His eyes lingered on Harry for a moment as Harry looked at him. His expression was difficult to read. He looked as sour and unpleasant as ever. Harry continued to watch him, long after Snape had looked away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="马克西姆夫人还在，就坐在海格旁边。他们正悄声谈论着什么。在桌子那边，坐在麦格教授身边的是斯内普。当哈利望着他时，他的目光在哈利身上停留了片刻。他脸上的表情很难捉摸。他看上去还像以前一样阴沉、讨厌。哈利在斯内普移开目光后，仍然注视了他很长时间。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The real Mad-Eye Moody was at the staff table now, his wooden leg and his magical eye back in place. He was extremely twitchy, jumping every time someone spoke to him. Harry couldn't blame him; Moody's fear of attack was bound to have been increased by his ten-month imprisonment in his own trunk. Professor Karkaroff's chair was empty. Harry wondered, as he sat down with the other Gryffindors, where Karkaroff was now, and whether Voldemort had caught up with him.</div>

<div class="line_en">What was it that Snape had done on Dumbledores orders, the night that Voldemort had returned? And why… why… was Dumbledore so convinced that Snape was truly on their side? He had been their spy, Dumbledore had said so in the Pensieve. Snape had turned spy against Voldemort, "at great personal risk." Was that the job he had taken up again? Had he made contact with the Death Eaters, perhaps? Pretended that he had never really gone over to Dumbledore, that he had been, like Voldemort himself, biding his time?</div>
