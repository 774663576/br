<div class="line_en">Harry remained within the confines of the Burrow's garden over the next few weeks. He spent most of his days playing two-a-side Quidditch in the Weasleys' orchard (he and Hermione against Ron and Ginny; Hermione was dreadful and Ginny good, so they were reasonably well matched) and his evenings eating triple helpings of everything Mrs. Weasley put in front of him.</div>

<div class="line_en">"There have been another couple of dementor attacks," he announced, as Mrs. Weasley passed him a large slice of birthday cake. "And they've found Igor Karkaroff's body in a shack up north. The Dark Mark had been set over it… well, frankly, I'm surprised he stayed alive for even a year after deserting the Death Eaters; Sirius's brother, Regulus, only managed a few days as far as I can remember."</div>

<div class="line_en">It would have been a happy, peaceful holiday had it not been for the stories of disappearances, odd accidents, even of deaths now appearing almost daily in the Prophet. Sometimes Bill and Mr. Weasley brought home news before it even reached the paper. To Mrs. Weasley's displeasure, Harry's sixteenth birthday celebrations were marred by grisly tidings brought to the party by Remus Lupin, who was looking gaunt and grim, his brown hair streaked liberally with gray, his clothes more ragged and patched than ever.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, I don't suppose we can put off a trip to Diagon Alley much longer now you've got these," sighed Mrs. Weasley, looking down Ron's booklist. "We'll go on Saturday as long as your father doesn't have to go into work again. I'm not going there without him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我说，现在你们收到了这些，”韦斯莱夫人低头看着罗恩的书单，叹着气说，“我们不能再拖延了，必须抓紧时间去对角巷。只要你们的父亲不加班，我们就星期六去。没有他陪着，我可不去那儿。”">查看中文翻译</div>

"And that goes for returning to Hogwarts as well!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那你就赶紧提高认识，年轻人，免得我觉得你太不成熟，不能跟我们一起去！”韦斯莱夫人生气地说着一把抓起她的大钟，放在刚刚洗干净的一堆毛巾上，钟上的九根针仍然都指着致命危险。“回霍格沃茨上学的事也是这样！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我的呢？”罗恩立刻问道，眼睛睁得大大的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That's already Harry's, idiot," said Bill. "I got it out of your vault for you, Harry, because it's taking about five hours for the public to get to their gold at the moment, the goblins have tightened security so much. Two days ago Arkie Philpott had a Probity Probe stuck up his… Well, trust me, this way's easier."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这都是哈利的，你这傻瓜。”比尔说，“哈利，我替你从保险库里取出来的，目前小妖精们加强了保安，戒备森严，普通人取钱要花大约五个小时。两天前，阿基·菲尔坡特把一根诚实探测器插在他的…唉，信不信由你，那样子更方便些。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But Ron was careful not to be flippant about Voldemort over the next few days. Saturday dawned without any more outbursts from Mrs. Weasley, though she seemed very tense at breakfast. Bill, who would be staying at home with Fleur (much to Hermione and Ginny's pleasure), passed a full money bag across the table to Harry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，在后来的几天里，罗恩变得很小心，再也不敢随便乱说伏地魔的事了。一直到星期六早晨，韦斯莱夫人没有再发火，但吃早饭时她显得非常紧张。比尔留在家里陪芙蓉（这使赫敏和金妮大感庆幸），他隔着桌子递给哈利一只满满的钱袋。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"'E is always so thoughtful," purred Fleur adoringly, stroking Bill's nose. Ginny mimed vomiting into her cereal behind Fleur. Harry choked over his cornflakes, and Ron thumped him on the back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他总是这么体贴周到。”芙蓉含情脉脉地低语道，一边抚摸着比尔的鼻子。她身后的金妮对着碗里的麦片做呕吐状。哈利被玉米片呛住了，罗恩使劲拍着他的后背。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was an overcast, murky day. One of the special Ministry of Magic cars, in which Harry had ridden once before, was awaiting them in the front yard when they emerged from the house, pulling on their cloaks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是一个昏暗的、阴云密布的日子。当他们裹着斗篷从房子里出来时，魔法部的一辆专用汽车已经在前院里等着了，这辆汽车哈利曾经坐过一次。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry said nothing; he did not much fancy doing his shopping while surrounded by a battalion of Aurors. He had stowed his Invisibility Cloak in his backpack and felt that, if that was good enough for Dumbledore, it ought to be good enough for the Ministry, though now he came to think of it, he was not sure the Ministry knew about his cloak.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利什么也没说。他可不愿意买东西时周围有一大批傲罗跟着。他已经把隐形衣塞在了背包里。他曾想，既然邓布利多不反对，魔法部也不会反对，不过现在仔细想来，他不能肯定魔法部是不是知道他有一件隐形衣。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's good Dad can get us these again," said Ron appreciatively, stretching luxuriously as the car moved smoothly away from the Burrow, Bill and Fleur waving from the kitchen window. He, Harry, Hermione, and Ginny were all sitting in roomy comfort in the wide backseat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“幸好爸爸又能给我们派车。”罗恩美滋滋地说着，舒舒服服地伸展了一下四肢。这时汽车轻快地驶离了陋居，比尔和芙蓉在厨房窗口朝他们挥着手。罗恩、哈利、赫敏和金妮都坐在宽敞、舒适的后座上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Don't get used to it, it's only because of Harry," said Mr. Weasley over his shoulder. He and Mrs. Weasley were in front with the Ministry driver; the front passenger seat had obligingly stretched into what resembled a two-seater sofa. "He's been given top-grade security status. And we'll be joining up with additional security at the Leaky Cauldron too."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你可别坐惯了，这只是为了哈利。”韦斯莱先生扭头说。他和韦斯莱夫人以及魔法部的司机坐在前面。司机旁边的乘客座位很体贴地变宽了，像一张双人沙发。“他现在享受一级安全保卫。到了破釜酒吧，还要给我们加强保安呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Here you are, then," said the driver, a surprisingly short while later, speaking for the first time as he slowed in Charing Cross Road and stopped outside the Leaky Cauldron. "I'm to wait for you, any idea how long you'll be?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你们到了。”没过一会儿司机就说，这是他说的第一句话。他放慢速度驶进了查林十字路，在破釜酒吧外面停了下来。“我等你们回来，知道需要多长时间吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry imitated Mr. Weasley and peered through the window; his heart leapt. There were no Aurors waiting outside the inn, but instead the gigantic, black-bearded form of Rubeus Hagrid, the Hogwarts gamekeeper, wearing a long beaverskin coat, beaming at the sight of Harry's face and oblivious to the startled stares of passing Muggles.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利也像韦斯莱先生那样透过车窗朝外望去。他的心顿时欢跳起来。酒吧外面并没有什么傲罗在等着，而是站着大块头、黑胡子的鲁伯·海格，霍格沃茨的狩猎场看守，他穿着一件长长的海狸皮大衣，一看见哈利的面孔就露出了喜悦的笑容，毫不理会过路的麻瓜们惊异的目光。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I know, jus' like old times, innit? See, the Ministry wanted ter send a bunch o' Aurors, but Dumbledore said I'd do," said Hagrid proudly, throwing out his chest and tucking his thumbs into his pockets. "Lets get goin' then -- after yeh, Molly, Arthur --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我知道，就像过去一样，是不？你看，魔法部本来想派一批傲罗来的，但邓布利多说我来就行了。”海格得意地说，他挺起胸膛，把两个大拇指插进了口袋里，“好了，我们进去吧——你们先请，莫丽，亚瑟——”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“哈利！”他粗声大气地说，哈利刚一下车，海格就使劲把他搂进怀里，把他的骨头都要挤碎了，“巴克比克——我是说蔫翼——你真应该看看它，哈利，它回到露天可高兴了——”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Leaky Cauldron was, for the first time in Harry's memory, completely empty. Only Tom the landlord, wizened and toothless, remained of the old crowd. He looked up hopefully as they entered, but before he could speak, Hagrid said importantly, "Jus' passin' through today, Tom, sure yeh understand, Hogwarts business, yeh know."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在哈利的记忆里，破釜酒吧第一次显得这么冷清，空无一人。过去那些热闹的人群不见了，只剩下满脸皱纹、牙齿掉光了的店主汤姆。他们一进去，汤姆满怀希望地抬起头，可是没等他开口，海格就郑重其事地说：“今天只是路过，汤姆，你肯定明白。是霍格沃茨的公事，你知道的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tom nodded gloomily and returned to wiping glasses; Harry, Hermione, Hagrid, and the Weasleys walked through the bar and out into the chilly little courtyard at the back where the dustbins stood. Hagrid raised his pink umbrella and rapped a certain brick in the wall, which opened at once to form an archway onto a winding cobbled street. They stepped through the entrance and paused, looking around.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汤姆闷闷不乐地点点头，继续擦他的玻璃杯。哈利、赫敏、海格和韦斯莱家的人穿过酒吧，来到后面放垃圾箱的阴冷的小院子里。海格举起手里的粉红色雨伞，敲了敲墙上的一块砖，那里立刻出现了一个门洞，通向一条蜿蜒曲折的卵石小路。他们跨过门洞，停下来四下张望着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Diagon Alley had changed. The colorful, glittering window displays of spellbooks, potion ingredients, and cauldrons were lost to view, hidden behind the large Ministry of Magic posters that had been pasted over them. Most of these somber purple posters carried blown-up versions of the security advice on the Ministry pamphlets that had been sent out over the summer, but others bore moving black-and-white photographs of Death Eaters known to be on the loose. Bellatrix Lestrange was sneering from the front of the nearest apothecary. A few windows were boarded up, including those of Florean Fortescue's Ice Cream Parlor. On the other hand, a number of shabby-looking stalls had sprung up along the street. The nearest one, which had been erected outside Flourish and Blotts, under a striped, stained awning, had a cardboard sign pinned to its front:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对角巷完全变了样儿。橱窗里原先陈列着咒语书、魔药原料和坩埚，五光十色的，如今都看不见了，而是被魔法部张贴的大幅通告遮得严严实实的。这些令人生畏的紫色通告，大部分都是魔法部暑期散发的那些小册子上的安全忠告的放大版，还有一些通告上印着被通缉的食死徒的黑白活动照片。贝拉特里克斯·莱斯特兰奇在近旁那家药店门口狰狞地冷笑着。有几扇窗户被木板钉死了，包括福洛林·福斯科的冰淇淋小店。而另一方面，街道两边突然冒出了许多破破烂烂的小摊子。离他们最近的一个摊子就搭在丽痕书店外一个污迹斑斑的条纹雨棚下面，摊前钉着一块硬纸板招牌：">查看中文翻译</div>

There were bins full of trick wands, the cheapest merely turning into rubber chickens or pairs of briefs when waved, the most expensive beating the unwary user around the head and neck, and boxes of quills, which came in Self-Inking, Spell-Checking, and Smart-Answer varieties. A space cleared in the crowd, and Harry pushed his way toward the counter, where a gaggle of delighted ten-year-olds was watching a tiny little wooden man slowly ascending the steps to a real set of gallows, both perched on a box that read: Reusable hangman -- spell it or he'll swing!</div>

<div class="line_en">Next moment, the bell over the door tinkled loudly as Malfoy stalked out of the shop looking very pleased with himself. He passed so close to Harry, Ron, and Hermione that they felt the cloak flutter around their knees again. Inside the shop, Borgin remained frozen; his unctuous smile had vanished; he looked worried.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着，店门上的铃铛响了起来，马尔福大步走出小店，一副志得意满的样子。他贴着哈利、罗恩和赫敏走了过去，他们感觉到隐形衣又在扑打着他们的膝盖。店里，博金仍然僵在那里，脸上虚假的笑容消失了，神情显得很忧虑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But Hermione had already ducked out from under the cloak. She checked her hair in the reflection in the glass, then marched into the shop, setting the bell tinkling again. Ron hastily fed the Extendable Ears back under the door and passed one of the strings to Harry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是赫敏已经从隐形衣下面钻了出去。她对着玻璃照了照她的头发，然后迈着大步走进店里，铃铛又一次丁丁当当地响了起来。罗恩赶紧把伸缩耳又塞到门缝下面，把一根细绳递给了哈利。">查看中文翻译</div>
