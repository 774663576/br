<div class="line_en">It was another of the things I had watched his helpers do for months, and now, in an attempt to hold on to what I could of him, I had volunteered to do it myself. The disease had left Morrie without the ability even to wiggle his toes, yet he could still feel pain, and massages helped relieve it. Also, of course, Morrie liked being held and touched. And at this point, anything I could do to make him happy, I was going to do.</div>

<div class="line_en">This was a few days after the "Nightline" interview. The sky was rainy and dark, and Morrie was beneath a blanket. I sat at the far end of his chair, holding his bare feet.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Mitch," he said, returning to the subject of forgiveness. "There is no point in keeping vengeance or stubbornness. These things" -- he sighed -- "these things I so regret in my life. Pride. Vanity. Why do we do the things we do?"</div>

<div class="line_en">The importance of forgiving was my question. I had seen those movies where the patriarch of the family is on his death bed and he calls for his estranged son so that he can make peace before he goes. I wondered if Morrie had any of that inside him, a sudden need to say "I'm sorry" before he died?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title='我想问的是原谅有多重要。我在电影里常看到一些大亨式的人物临终前把疏远的儿子叫到床前，然后才平静地死去。我不知道莫里是否也有这种念头：在他临终前突然想说声"对不起"？'>查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Morrie nodded. "Do you see that sculpture?" He tilted his head toward a bust that sat high on a shelf against the far wall of his office. I had never really noticed it before. Cast in bronze, it was the face of a man in his early forties, wearing a necktie, a tuft of hair falling across his forehead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title='莫里点点头。"看见那尊雕像吗？"他斜了斜头，指向靠着对面墙的书橱上的一个头像。它放在书橱的昏层，我平时从来没有注意到。雕像是铜的，塑的是一个四十出头的男子，系着领带，一绺头发飘落在额前。'>查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That's me," Morrie said. "A friend of mine sculpted that maybe thirty years ago. His name was Norman. We used to spend so much time together. We went swimming. We took rides to New York. He had me over to his house in Cambridge, and he sculpted that bust of me down in his basement. It took several weeks to do it, but he really wanted to get it right."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title='"那是我，"莫里说，"一个朋友大约在三十年前雕刻的。他叫诺曼。我们以前常在一起。我们去游泳，我们搭车去纽约。他把我带到他在剑桥①的公寓，在他的地下室里为我雕刻了这尊头像。这花了他好几个星期，可他干得一丝不苟。"①哈佛大学所在地。'>查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I studied the face. How strange to see a three-dimensional Morrie, so healthy, so young, watching over us as we spoke. Even in bronze, he had a whimsical look, and I thought this friend had sculpted a little spirit as well.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我望着那张脸，真有一种异样的感觉：那个三维形的莫里是那么健康，那么年轻，他看着我们交谈。虽然是铜像，但仍透出几许活泼的神态。我觉得那位朋友确实刻出了莫里的一些内在气质。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, here's the sad part of the story," Morrie said. "Norman and his wife moved away to Chicago. A little while later, my wife, Charlotte, had to have a pretty serious operation. Norman and his wife never got in touch with us. I know they knew about it. Charlotte and I were very hurt because they never called to see how she was. So we dropped the relationship.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title='"咳，令人不快的事情发生了，"莫里说。"诺曼和他妻子去了芝加哥。过后没多久，我妻子夏洛特动了一次大手术。诺曼和他妻子始终没跟我们联系，但我知道他们是知道这件事的。他们伤了我和夏洛特的心：竟连一个电话都不打。于是我们就中断了关系。'>查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I continued rubbing lotion into his lifeless toes. He wept for a few minutes, alone with his memories.</div>
