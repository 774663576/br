<div class="line_en">At last she reached the top. Beyond the ice-cream and souvenir stands (none of which happened to be open) stretched a broad lawn spotted here and there with trees. She noticed several men on the lawn. The closer she came to them, the slower she walked. There were six in all. They were standing or strolling along at a leisurely pace like golfers looking over the course and weighing various clubs in their hands, trying to get into the proper frame of mind for a match.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她到了最高点。在平常卖冰淇淋、明信片和饼干的小摊后面（这天一个小贩都没有），延展开一片一望无际的草坪，上面稀疏有几棵树。她看到那里有几个人。她走过去，越靠近，越是把脚步放慢。一共有六个人。他们有的站着不动，有的在慢慢地来回走着，有点像高尔夫球选手在观察地势的起伏，掂量手中的球杆，在比赛前全神贯注地让自己进入状态。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Coming out at the foot of Petrin Hill, that great green mound rising up in the middle of Prague, she was surprised to find it devoid of people. This was strange, because at other times half of Prague seemed to be milling about. It made her anxious. But the hill was so quiet and the quiet so comforting that she yielded fully to its embrace. On her way up, she paused several times to look back: below her she saw the towers and bridges; the saints were shaking their fists and lifting their stone eyes to the clouds. It was the most beautiful city in the world.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="彼得山是位于布拉格市中心的一座树木葱茏的山丘。来到山脚，她惊讶地发现一个人都没有。真奇怪，往常总是有很多布拉格人来这里呼吸新鲜空气。她心中忐忑不安，但山路如此安静，而静谧是令人安心的，于是她不再紧张，充满信任地投到山的怀抱中。她向上走着，时而停下来看看身后。她看到脚下有许多城楼和桥。圣徒雕像挥着拳头，两只石头眼睛凝望云端，这是世界上最美的城市。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She finally came near them. Of the six men, three were there to play the same role as she: they were unsettled; they seemed eager to ask all sorts of questions, but feared making nuisances of themselves and so held their tongues and merely looked about inquisitively.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她总算来到他们身边了。在这六个人当中，她肯定有三个和她因同样的原因而来：他们都惶恐不安，看来有一大堆问题要问，可又怕打搅了他人，所以宁愿不开口，只是带着询问的神色四处张望。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The other three radiated condescending benevolence. One of them had a rifle in his hand. Spotting Tereza, he waved at her and said with a smile, Yes, this is the place.</div>

<div class="line_en">The man with the rifle continued: Let me explain why I wish to know. The only time we do this is when we are certain that the people who come to us have chosen to die of their own accord. We consider it a service.</div>

<div class="line_en">And so three men, their eyes blindfolded, their heads turned to the sky, stood with their backs against three trees on the endless lawn.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“您愿意第一个上吗？”他问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Because she wanted to put off the execution as long as she could, she said, No, please, no. If it's at all possible, I'd like to be last.</div>

<div class="line_en">As you please, he said, and went off to the others. Nei-ther of his assistants was armed; their sole function was to at-tend to the people who were to die.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“随您的便。”男人说着，走向了其他人。他的两个助手没带武器，在这里只是为了照顾要死的人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They took them by the arms and walked them across the lawn. The grassy surface proved quite an expanse; it ran as far as the eye could see. The people to be executed were allowed to choose their own trees. They paused at each one and looked it over carefully, unable to make up their minds. Two of them eventually chose plane trees, but the third wandered on and on, no tree apparently striking him as worthy of his death. The assistant who held him by the arm guided him along gently and patiently until at last the man lost the courage to go on and stopped at a luxuriant maple.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们搀着想死的人的胳膊，陪着他们在草地上走着。绿草如茵，一望无际。自愿受刑者可以选择自己的一棵树。他们停下脚步，久久地打量着，怎么也拿不定主意。最后，三人中有两个终于选定了两棵悬铃木，可第三个却越走越远，没找到一棵适合他死的树。助手温和地搀着他的手臂，不厌其烦地陪伴他，但是最后，他实在没有勇气走得更远了，于是停在了一棵枝叶繁杂的槭树旁。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Without taking a step, the man with the rifle turned in a different direction, and one of the other men silently crumpled. And seconds later (again the man with the rifle merely turned in place), the third man sank to the lawn.</div>
