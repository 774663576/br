<div class="line_en">Then he went to visit Signora Neroni. This was, he knew, extremely unwise. Not only was her husband living, so he, Slope, could not court her honestly, but in addition, she had nothing to recommend her as a clergyman's wife; she had no fortune and she was a helpless, hopeless cripple. He knew that by visiting her he might ruin his reputation and his chances with Mrs Bold, but he could not help himself. Passion, for the first time in his life, was too strong for him.</div>

<div class="line_en">The signora, on the other hand, cared no more for Mr Slope than for the twenty others who had admired her before him.

The signora did not love at all, but she knew every move in the game.</div>

<div class="line_en">That afternoon the archdeacon and Mr Harding, who were in Barchester on business, collected Eleanor's post from her house, to take back to her. As soon as Dr Grantly saw Mr Slope's letter, he recognized his enemy's handwriting on the envelope.

<div class="line_en">After dinner, the ladies went into the sitting room, while the gentlemen stayed at table with their final glass of wine. Dr Grantly had asked his wife to speak to Eleanor about her correspondence with Mr Slope, and so, rather unwillingly, Susan asked her younger sister about the letter. Eleanor, feeling she was being treated like a child, refused to tell Susan what the letter was about, or to show it to her; she became angrier and angrier at her sister's continual questioning. Finally Susan said, with great formality, "Well, Eleanor, it is my duty to tell you that the archdeacon thinks such a correspondence is disgraceful, and that he cannot allow it to go on in his house."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="晚饭后，女士们去了会客厅，男士们还坐在桌边喝最后一杯酒。格兰特利博士此前要妻子去跟埃莉诺聊聊，看斯洛普先生写信给她做什么，到这会儿，苏珊便很不情愿地向妹妹问起了那封信的内容。埃莉诺觉得自己被当成小孩子对待，于是不肯告诉苏珊，也不肯把信拿给她看。姐姐不断盘问，使她越来越气恼。到最后，苏珊郑重其事地说：“好了，埃莉诺，我有责任告诉你，执事长认为这样的信件往来是不光彩的，还有，他不能允许这种事继续在自己家里发生。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Eleanor opened the letter as she was getting dressed for dinner. She was so delighted to find that her father could now become warden again that she did not realize the information should not have come to her from an unmarried young clergyman. As she read on, she was offended by her boy being called Mr Slope's darling, and when she came to the mention of her silken curls, she gave a shudder of disgust. But on the whole she was grateful to Mr Slope for wishing to help her father.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="换衣服吃晚饭的时候，埃莉诺拆开了那封信。她知道父亲可以再次当上院长，不由得万分欢喜，并没有意识到，这个消息不该来自一个未婚的年轻神职人员。她接着往下看，看到自己的儿子被称作斯洛普先生的“亲爱的”，觉得很不舒服。再看到信中提及自己的“如丝绸般的卷发”，厌恶至极，不由打了个哆嗦。不过，总的来说，她还是很感激斯洛普先生帮父亲的好意。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At dinner, however, the whole party looked stern and silent. Dr Grantly had betrayed his sister-in-law by whispering into Mr Arabin's ear before the meal, "I very much fear Eleanor is to marry Mr Slope!" Mr Arabin had been horrified to hear it, and was now as sorrowful and unsociable as the Grantlys. Eleanor, unaware that Mr Slope's letter had already been much discussed, felt that she had been judged guilty of something, but had no idea what.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，吃晚饭的时候，所有人都是一脸严肃、一声不吭。格兰特利博士泄露了自己小姨子的秘密，饭前对阿拉宾先生耳语了一句：“我很担心埃莉诺会嫁给斯洛普先生！”闻听此言，阿拉宾先生吓了一跳，此刻就和格兰特利夫妇一样，心里不痛快，沉默寡言。埃莉诺不知道大家已经就斯洛普先生的来信进行过深入的讨论，只觉得大家是认定自己犯了错，具体是什么错则不得而知。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Eleanor's eyes flashed fire as she jumped up from her seat. "You may tell the archdeacon that wherever I am, I shall receive letters from whom I please. If Dr Grantly has used the word 'disgraceful', I think he has been ungentlemanly and inhospitable. I shall show the letter to Father, but to no one else." And she ran upstairs to her bedroom and her baby.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃莉诺从座椅上跳起来，眼睛里怒火熊熊。“你可以告诉执事长，不管是在哪里，我爱收谁的信就收谁的信。如果格兰特利博士真的说了‘不光彩的’这个词，那我就觉得他没有绅士风度，也很刻薄。我会把信拿给父亲看，其他人就算了吧。”说完她飞快地跑进楼上的卧室，回到孩子身边。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Half an hour later Mr Harding crept up to her room and knocked at the door. Eleanor welcomed him in, and kissed him, and told him she could not put up with the archdeacon's pride and unkindness any longer. She showed him Mr Slope's letter, thinking her father would see immediately what an innocent, well-meaning letter it was. But poor Mr Harding could only see the "darling little friend" and the "silken curls", and felt sure Dr Grantly's suspicions were correct. It was almost a love-letter, and it meant that Eleanor must be planning to marry the hated Slope. The foolish, weak, loving father did not say one word to her. If he had, Eleanor would have expressed her disgust at the idea of marriage to the chaplain, Mr Harding would have been delighted, the Grantlys would have apologized, and Mr Arabin -- Mr Arabin would have dreamt of Eleanor and woken next morning with ideas of love and plans for marriage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="半小时过后，哈丁先生慢吞吞地走到她的卧室门口，敲了敲门。埃莉诺把他迎了进去，亲了亲他，然后告诉他，自己再也无法忍受执事长的自大和刻薄。她把斯洛普先生的信拿给父亲看，觉得父亲肯定会立刻看出这封信是多么单纯、一片好心。然而，可怜的哈丁先生只看见了“亲爱的小朋友”和“如丝绸般的卷发”，由此确信格兰特利博士的怀疑是正确的。这封信简直与情书无异，意味着埃莉诺一定是有了打算，准备嫁给可恨的斯洛普。这位愚钝、软弱而慈爱的父亲什么也没对女儿说。如果他说了，埃莉诺会告诉他，嫁给那位特遣牧师她想想就觉得厌恶，哈丁先生就会笑逐颜开，格兰特利夫妇就会赔礼道歉，阿拉宾先生呢——阿拉宾先生就会梦见埃莉诺，第二天早上醒来的时候，脑子里满是恋爱的念头和结婚的计划。">查看中文翻译</div>

Eleanor did mind; she was tired and unhappy, but she was not a coward. So she tied on her cap and went downstairs with a beating heart.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="紧接着，又有人敲响了埃莉诺的房门。仆人捎来了执事长的口信，问博尔德太太愿不愿意到格兰特利博士的书房去聊两分钟。埃莉诺并不愿意，因为她既疲惫又难过。不过她并不懦弱，于是就系好帽子下了楼，一颗心怦怦直跳。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The archdeacon started his speech to Eleanor by explaining that he wanted to give her some brotherly advice. She replied coldly that if she needed any advice, she had her father to ask. This made Dr Grantly hesitate, but he went on to ask about Mr Slope's letter.

<div class="line_en">He found her alone in the sitting room. She had spent a sleepless night and a miserable morning, and was not at all pleased to see Mr Arabin, whom she blamed for supporting the archdeacon in his unjust attacks on Mr Slope.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他找到她的时候，她独自待在会客厅里。她一夜未曾合眼，早上也过得很不愉快。见到阿拉宾先生，她一点儿也不高兴，因为她怪他帮着执事长对斯洛普先生进行了不公正的抨击。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Meanwhile Mr Arabin's every waking thought was of Eleanor. As soon as he had heard that another man was carrying off this sweet prize, he began to be very fond of her himself. In fact, he was in love with her, although he did not know it yet, and he rode back from St Ewold's to Plumstead just before lunch, hoping for an opportunity to see her before she left.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="与此同时，阿拉宾先生时时刻刻都在想着埃莉诺。一听说另一个男人即将带走这个可人儿，他对她的喜爱之情立刻变得强烈。事实上，他已经爱上了她，只是他自己还不知道。赶在午饭前，他从圣埃沃兹骑马回到了普拉姆斯特德，希望在她离开前还有机会见一面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I am sorry our pleasant time together is over so soon, Mrs Bold --" he began nervously.</div>

<div class="line_en">"You advised Dr Grantly concerning my -- friendship -- with Mr Slope," she replied in a terribly calm voice. "Just because I have treated that gentleman with politeness, you and Dr Grantly assume I am to marry him -- something no reasonable person would consider possible. Your accusation is simply designed to make me hate this enemy of yours, that's all."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“关于我——和斯洛普先生——的友谊，您向格兰特利博士提了些建议。”她用平静得可怕的声音说，“仅仅因为我礼貌地对待了那位绅士，您和格兰特利博士就认为我会嫁给他——但凡有点儿理性的人都会觉得，这是不可能的事。你们这么指责我，无非是为了让我恨你们这个对手，就这么简单。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She turned her back on him and walked out into the garden. Mr Arabin was left in the room, counting the squares in the pattern of the carpet. He was dreadfully unhappy at the hard words he had received, and yet happy, wonderfully happy, at the thought that, after all, the woman whom he so much admired was not to become the wife of the man whom he so much disliked. At last he was aware that he was in love. Forty years had passed over his head, and so far woman's beauty had never given him an uneasy moment. His present moment was very uneasy.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我不想跟任何人为敌，”埃莉诺说，“但是，要跟人做朋友，那就得受人尊重。”她很生他的气，因为他认为，她的判断力如此之差，性格也如此软弱，乃至于可能嫁给斯洛普先生。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And he walked beside her, struggling to express his feelings. Eleanor was determined to give him no assistance. Poor Mr Arabin! The words in his heart were, "Since you do not love that other man, and are not to be his wife, can you love me, will you be my wife?" But with all his experience of public speaking in colleges, churches, and cathedrals, now, when he most needed to speak persuasively, the words would not come.</div>
