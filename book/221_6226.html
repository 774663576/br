<div class="line_en">But Mum sleeping downstairs also involved her and Dad needing their own quilt, their own pillows and even under-sheet, as Mum couldn't sleep properly unless her bed was just as she liked it. So after supper she and Treena would strip Mum and Dad's bed and put on a new set of sheets, together with a mattress protector, just in case Thomas had an accident. Mum and Dad's bedding, meanwhile, would be folded and placed in the corner of the living room, where Thomas would dive into it and on to it and string the sheet across the dining chairs to turn it into a tent.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was no way around it. The sleeping arrangements just weren't working. Every weekend that Treena came home, the Clark family began a lengthy, nocturnal game of musical beds. After supper on Friday night Mum and Dad would offer up their bedroom, and Treena would accept it, after they had reassured her that no, they were not in the least bit put out, and how much better Thomas was at sleeping in a room he knew. It would mean, they said, that everyone got a good night's sleep.</div>

<div class="line_en">One weekend I offered to sleep at Patrick's and everyone looked secretly relieved. But then, while I was away, Thomas put sticky fingers all over my new blinds and drew on my new duvet cover in permanent pen, at which point Mum and Dad decided it would be best if they slept in my room, while Treena and Thomas went into theirs, where the odd bit of felt tip apparently didn't matter.</div>

<div class="line_en">Granddad offered his room, but nobody took it. It smelt of yellowing copies of the Racing Post and Old Holborn, and it would have taken all weekend to clear out. I would alternately feel guilty -- all this was my fault, after all -- while knowing I would not offer to return to the box room. It had become a kind of spectre for me, that airless little room with no windows. The thought of sleeping in there again made my chest feel tight. I was twenty-seven years old. I was the main earner of the family. I could not sleep in what was essentially a cupboard.</div>

<div class="line_en">And he was rarely home, even on a Friday or Saturday night. What with his training and my work hours we seemed to have become used to spending less time together. I could follow him down to the track and watch him push himself round and round in circles until he had completed the requisite number of miles, or I could stay home and watch television by myself, curled up in a corner of his vast leather settee. There was no food in the fridge, apart from strips of turkey breast and vile energy drinks the consistency of frogspawn. Treena and I had tried one once and spat it out, gagging theatrically, like children.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他很少在家，即使是周五周六的晚上。他要训练，我要工作，我们越来越少有空在一起。我会跟随他去跑道，看他一圈又一圈地跑，直到跑完了必须的英里数。或者我待在家里，自己看电视，蜷缩在他巨大皮椅的一角。冰箱里没有食物，除了火鸡胸脯肉片和讨厌的运动饮料绿藻汁。特丽娜和我以前喝过一次，马上吐了出来，像孩子一样夸张地呕吐。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And then there was Patrick. Patrick was now a man obsessed. He ate, drank, lived and breathed the Xtreme Viking. His flat, normally sparsely furnished and immaculate, was strung with training schedules and dietary sheets. He had a new lightweight bike which lived in the hallway and which I wasn't allowed to touch, in case I interfered with its finely balanced lightweight racing capabilities.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="还有帕特里克那边的问题。帕特里克现在着了魔，他吃饭、喝水、生活、呼吸，无一不以极限铁人三项为出发点。他的公寓，平常都没放什么东西，很干净，如今挂满了训练规划和饮食表。门厅放了一辆崭新的轻型自行车。他不准我碰，怕我干扰了它良好的均衡轻便的赛车性能。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The truth of it was I didn't like Patrick's flat. He had bought it a year ago, when he finally felt his mother would be okay by herself. His business had done well, and he had told me it was important that one of us get on to the property ladder. I suppose that would have been the cue for us to have a conversation about whether we were going to live together, but somehow it didn't happen, and neither of us is the type to bring up subjects that make us feel a bit uncomfortable. As a result, there was nothing of me in that flat, despite our years together. I had never quite been able to tell him, but I would rather live in my house, with all its noise and clutter, than in that soulless, featureless bachelor pad, with its allocated parking spaces and executive view of the castle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其实我不喜欢帕特里克的公寓。他终于觉得他母亲一个人过没有问题时，才在一年前买了这套公寓。他生意做得不错，他说我们中必须有一个人买房。我本来以为会有一场我们是否应该住在一起的谈话，但并没有。我们两人都不会提起让人尴尬的话题。因此，即使我们在一起这么多年，公寓里仍没有任何我的痕迹。我从来没能告诉他，我情愿住在自己家里，虽然周围都是噪声和吵闹声，也不愿意住在那栋没有生气、毫无特色的单身公寓，哪怕那里有分配好的停车位，看得到城堡的风景。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Got to stick to the schedule, babe," he would say, if I told him. "If I do any fewer than twenty-three miles at this stage of the game, I'll never make it back on schedule." Then he would give me the latest update on his shin splints or ask me to pass him the heat spray.</div>

How could I? By the time the Xtreme Viking took place, there would be less than one week of my contract left to run. I suppose I was childishly refusing to deal with it all, but truthfully, all I could see was Will and a ticking clock. Not a lot else seemed to register.</div>

I began painting concealer on my dark shadows with the same slapdash abandon as if I were decorating.</div>

He could occasionally be persuaded into an action thriller, even an epic romance, but drew the line at romantic comedies.

<div class="line_en">2. Listening to classical music. He knew an awful lot about it. He also liked some modern stuff, but said jazz was mostly pretentious guff. When he saw the contents of my MP3 player one afternoon, he laughed so hard he nearly dislodged one of his tubes.</div>

<div class="line_en">4. Making me read books or magazines, and then talk about them. Knowledge is power, Clark, he would say. I hated this at first; it felt like I was at school, being quizzed on my powers of memory. But after a while I realized that, in Will's eyes, there were no wrong answers. He actually liked me to argue with him. He asked me what I thought of things in the newspapers, disagreed with me about characters in books. He seemed to hold opinions on almost everything -- what the government was doing, whether one business should buy another, whether someone should have been sent to jail. If he thought I was being lazy, or parroting my parents' or Patrick's ideas, he would just say a flat, "No. Not good enough." He would look so disappointed if I said I knew nothing about it; I had begun to anticipate him and now read a newspaper on the bus on the way in, just so I felt prepared. "Good point, Clark," he would say, and I would find myself beaming. And then give myself a kick for allowing Will to patronize me again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="4、让我阅读书或杂志，然后说出感想。“知识就是力量，克拉克。”他这么说。起初我很讨厌，好像在学校一样，要考查我的记忆力。但过了一阵后我意识到，在威尔看来，没有错误的答案。他就是喜欢我跟他争辩。他问我对于报纸上的新闻和对于书中的人物的看法，他的观点总是与我有分歧。每样事情他似乎都有自己的立场——政府正在做的事情，一家企业是否要兼并另一家企业，某人是否应该被送进监狱。要是他发现我没有动脑筋，重复我父母或是帕特里克的观点，他就会直截了当地说：“不，还不够好。”要是我说我对此一无所知，他会非常失望。我变得期待他的提问，来上班的公车上我都会看报纸，做好准备。“很好的观点，克拉克。”他会这么说，我会眉开眼笑，然后踢自己一脚，又让威尔当了一回老师。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">6. Being a bloke. Especially with Nathan. Occasionally, before the evening routine, they would go and sit at the end of the garden and Nathan would crack open a couple of beers. Sometimes I heard them discussing rugby, or joking about some woman they had seen on the television, and it wouldn't sound like Will at all. But I understood he needed this; he needed someone with whom he could just be a bloke, doing blokey things. It was a small bit of "normal" in his strange, separate life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="6、沉溺于男性活动，尤其跟内森在一起时。有时，在傍晚的例行工作之前，他们会坐在花园尽头，内森撬开几瓶啤酒。有时我听到他们在讨论橄榄球，或就在电视上看到的某个女人开玩笑。这看起来一点也不像威尔。但是我理解他需要这些，他需要有这样一个人跟他一起，那时他是一个男人，能做些男性做的事情。在他奇怪而独立的生活中，这是一小部分“正常”的生活。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">5. Getting a shave. Every two days now, I lathered up his jaw and made him presentable. If he wasn't having a bad day, he would lean back in his chair, close his eyes, and the closest thing I saw to physical pleasure would spread across his face. Perhaps I've invented that. Perhaps I saw what I wanted to see. But he would be completely silent as I gently ran the blade across his chin, smoothing and scraping, and when he did open his eyes his expression had softened, like someone coming out of a particularly satisfactory sleep. His face now held some colour from our time spent outside; his was the kind of skin that tanned easily. I kept the razors high up in the bathroom cabinet, tucked behind a large bottle of conditioner.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="5、刮胡须。现在每两天刮一次，我在他的下巴上涂皂沫，把他弄体面。如果他那天状况并不糟糕，他会靠在椅背上，闭上眼睛，我觉得最有肌肤相亲快感的事情就是给他刮脸。也许这是我自创的，也许我看到了我想看到的东西。但是我拿刀片轻柔地在他下巴上来回剃掉胡须并且刮平时，他总是默不作声。他睁开眼睛时，表情变得柔和，像是刚从一个美梦中醒来。由于我们现在经常外出，他的脸上也有了一些光彩，他的皮肤是那种很容易晒黑的类型。我把剃刀放在浴室贮藏橱的上方，塞在一大瓶护发素的后面。">查看中文翻译</div>
