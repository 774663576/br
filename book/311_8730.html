<div class="line_en">"Is that so hard to believe?" Cal opened his carton of milk completely and drank out of it like a cup. "She wasn't even into you, you know.

<div class="line_cn" title="“我是说聊天。”帕克不确定自己想说什么，就低头看着桌子。埃莉诺的代数课本写满了字，一首歌的歌词绕着另一首歌的歌名。他看见自己的名字，弯曲的小字，躲在“史密斯乐队”某首歌的副歌里。人总是会一下子找到自己的名字。">查看中文翻译</div>
