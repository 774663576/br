<div class="line_en">We sat down in a conference room on the fifth floor of the Journal's newsroom. The tone was set from the start when King and Dearborn pulled out little tape recorders and placed them at each end of the conference table. The message was clear: they were approaching the meeting as a deposition in a future legal proceeding.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Theranos delegation that came to the Journal's offices was made up mostly of lawyers. Leading the pack was David Boies. He was flanked by Mike Brille, Meredith Dearborn, and Heather King, a former Boies Schiller partner and Hillary Clinton aide who had become Theranos's general counsel less than two months earlier. Rounding out the group were Matthew Traub and Peter Fritsch, a former Journal reporter who was the cofounder of an opposition research firm in Washington, D. C. The lone Theranos executive was Daniel Young.</div>

<div class="line_en">Boies chimed in for the first time, playing the good cop to King's bad cop. "We really just want to go through this step-by-step so that you see that there just really isn't a story here," the seventy-four-year-old superlawyer said softly. With his bushy eyebrows and thinning gray hair, he called to mind a grandfather trying to reconcile squabbling children.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="波伊斯首度开口插话，对比金恩的黑脸，他扮起白脸来。「其实，我们只是想一步步把这整个讨论一遍，如此你们就能明白，真的没有什么报导的价值。」这位七十四岁王牌律师轻声说。看着他浓密的眉毛、灰白稀疏的头发，仿佛老爷爷试着调停争吵不休的孩子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It seems apparent to us that certainly one of your key sources is a young man named Tyler Shultz." She looked straight at me as she said it in what was clearly a rehearsed opening salvo to try to fluster me. I kept my poker face on and said nothing. They could suspect Tyler all they wanted, but I wasn't about to betray his confidence and give them the confirmation they were fishing for. She continued by denigrating Tyler as young and unqualified and then asserting that my other sources were disgruntled former employees who were equally unreliable. Mike interrupted her diatribe. We weren't going to disclose who our confidential sources were nor should Theranos presume to know their identities, he said politely but firmly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「在我们看来，你们的重要消息来源很明显是叫做泰勒．舒兹的年轻人。」她说这句话的时候，双眼死盯着我看，显然是事先排练好的，一开头就来个下马威，试图引起我慌乱不安。我的扑克脸一动也不动，什么都没说。他们要怀疑泰勒是他们的自由，但我不会把他泄漏出来的，我不会上当帮他们证实。接着，她继续把泰勒抹黑成一个年轻无知、不够资格的人，然后又断言其他线人一定是心生不满的离职员工，同样不可信。我的主编麦可打断她的谩骂，他客气但坚定地说，我们绝对不会透露秘密来源是谁，Theranos也不应该妄自推测。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At Traub's request, I had sent a new set of eighty questions two weeks earlier that were to form the basis for our discussion. King opened the meeting by saying they were there to rebut the "false premises" embedded in those questions. Then she lobbed the first missile.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="应川布的要求，几周前我先寄了一份新的问题清单给他们，这次讨论就会根据那八十道问题进行。金恩先起了个头，她说他们来此是为了反驳那些问题所隐含的「错误假设」，接着她发射第一颗飞弹。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I suggested we begin addressing the questions I had sent, but, before I had time to read the first one, King's demeanor turned aggressive again and she issued a sharp warning: "We do not consent to your publication of our trade secrets."</div>

<div class="line_en">My retort seemed to have the desired effect.

However, we were soon at loggerheads again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我的回击似乎达到了想要的效果，她的态度和缓下来，于是我们开始一一讨论我所列的问题，预期在场唯一的Theranos高层代表会是回答问题的人。然而，冲突很快又再起。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After Young acknowledged that Theranos owned commercial blood analyzers, which he claimed the company used only for comparison purposes, rather than for delivering patient results, I asked if one of them was the Siemens ADVIA. He declined to comment, citing trade secrets. I then asked whether Theranos ran small finger-stick samples on the Siemens ADVIA with a special dilution protocol. He again invoked trade secrets to avoid answering the question but argued that diluting blood samples was common in the lab industry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹尼尔．杨承认Theranos内部有商用血液分析仪（他声称只用来比较检测结果，而非直接用于产出结果），我问他其中是不是有一台是西门子的ADVIA，他以商业机密为由拒绝回答。接着，我问Theranos是不是经过特殊的稀释流程，使用那台西门子ADVIA检测指尖血液小样本，他再次搬出商业机密来回避问题，不过他辩称，稀释血液样本是实验室产业界很普遍的做法。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We were minutes into the meeting and it had become clear to me that her main strategy was going to be to try to intimidate us, so I decided it was time to convey to her that that wasn't going to work.</div>

<div class="line_en">As I continued to press for more substantive answers, Boies grew angry. He was suddenly no longer the amiable grandfatherly figure. He growled and flashed his teeth like an old grizzly bear. This was the David Boies who inspired fear in his courtroom adversaries, I thought to myself. He took a swipe at my reporting methods, saying I had asked some doctors loaded questions that were damaging to Theranos. That sparked a tense exchange between us. We stared each other down from across the table.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我不断试图追问出比较实质的答案，波伊斯开始不高兴了，他突然不再是那个和蔼可亲的老爷爷，厉声咆哮起来，像一只怒吼的老灰熊露出利牙。我心里告诉自己，这就是那个在法庭上令对手胆寒的大卫．波伊斯。他开始攻击我的采访方式，说我都是拿对Theranos不利的问题去问医生，这话激起了我们两人激烈的交锋，我们隔着桌子互相怒瞪对方。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jay Conti jumped in to defuse the situation but was soon sparring with King and Brille. Their argument took an almost farcical turn.</div>

<div class="line_en">From there, the discussion went in circles. These questions were at the heart of my story, I said. If they weren't prepared to answer them, what was the point of our meeting? Boies replied that they were trying to be helpful but that they would not reveal what methods Theranos employed unless we signed nondisclosure agreements. Those were secrets Quest and LabCorp were desperately trying to find out by any means possible, including industrial espionage, he claimed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从这里开始，讨论就陷入鬼打墙。我说，这些问题是我的报导重点，如果他们不准备回答，那我们开会的目的是什么？波伊斯回答他们真的想帮忙，但他们不会透露Theranos采用什么方法，除非我们签署保密同意书。他宣称，那些机密是奎斯特公司和美国实验室公司用尽一切方法（包括动用产业间谍），迫切想知道的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It just feels like you want us to give you the formula for Coke in order to convince you that it doesn't contain arsenic," King said.</div>

<div class="line_en">We turned to my questions about the Edison. How many blood tests did Theranos perform on the device? That too was a trade secret, they said. I felt like I was watching a live performance of the Theater of the Absurd.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们把问题转移到爱迪生。Theranos到底有多少血液检测是用爱迪生做的？他们说这同样是商业机密。我觉得自己好像在看荒谬剧场的现场表演。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="「没有人要可口可乐的秘方！」杰气呼呼地回答。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">More arguing ensued over the issue of what legitimately constituted a trade secret. How could anything involving a commercial analyzer manufactured by a third party possibly be deemed a Theranos trade secret? I asked. Brille replied unconvincingly that the distinction wasn't as simple as I made it out to be.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接下来有更多争执围绕着何谓商业机密打转。怎么能把第三方制造的商用分析仪相关问题，也视为Theranos的商业机密？我问。布里耶的回答很没有说服力，他说这两者的差别不是我说的那么简单。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Did Theranos really have any new technology? I asked provocatively.</div>

<div class="line_en">Boies's temper flared again. Testing tiny finger-stick samples was something no one in the laboratory industry had been able to do before, he fumed. "Theranos is doing it and, unless it's magic, it's a new technology!"</div>

<div class="line_en">One of his answers struck me as odd. When I brought up the Hematology Reports study Holmes had coauthored, Young immediately dismissed it as outdated. It had been conducted with older Theranos technology and its data were ancient, dating back to 2008, he said. Why then had Holmes cited it to The New Yorker? I wondered. It seemed Theranos was now distancing itself from it, probably because it was conscious of its flimsiness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他有个回答倒是出乎我的意料。当我提出霍姆斯刊登于《血液学报告》、挂名共同作者的研究，杨立刻说那份研究已经过时了。他说，那是用Theranos比较旧的技术所做的研究，里面的数据已经很古老，要回溯到二〇〇八年那么早以前。那为什么霍姆斯接受《纽约客》采访时要拿出来讲呢？我心里很纳闷。Theranos现在似乎在做切割，大概也意识到那份研究很薄弱吧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The meeting dragged on in this manner for four more hours. As we continued going through my list of questions, Young did answer some of them without invoking trade secrets. He acknowledged problems with Theranos's potassium test but claimed they had quickly been solved and none of the faulty results had been released to any patients. Alan Beam had told me otherwise, so I suspected Young was lying about that. Young also confirmed that Theranos conducted proficiency testing differently than most laboratories but argued this was justified by the uniqueness of its technology. He also confirmed that the CLIA inspector hadn't seen the Normandy part of Theranos's lab during her inspection but claimed she had been informed of its existence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="会议就这样慢吞吞开了四个多小时，在这过程中，丹尼尔．杨倒是回答了几个问题，没有搬出商业机密回避。他承认Theranos的钾检测有问题，但宣称很快就解决了，而且错误的检测结果并没有流入病患之手。这跟艾伦．毕姆告诉我的不一样，所以我怀疑杨说谎。另外，杨还证实Theranos所做的能力测试的确跟大部分实验室不同，但他辩称Theranos这么做是合理的，因为Theranos的技术是市面上独一无二。他也证实CLIA稽查员并没有稽查到「诺曼第」，但是宣称稽查员有被告知「诺曼第」的存在。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We continued going around in circles, never getting a straight answer about how many tests Theranos performed on the Edison versus commercial analyzers. It was frustrating but also a sign that I was on the right track. They wouldn't be stonewalling if they had nothing to hide.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="鬼打墙仍然持续。对于Theranos到底有多少检测是用爱迪生做的、有多少是用商用分析仪做的，我们迟迟得不到直接的答案，一整个叫人泄气，但这也代表我走在正确的路上。如果真的没有什么好隐瞒，他们就不会这么处处设限阻碍。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We eventually turned to the instances of questionable test results I had gathered during my reporting. To be able to respond to my specific patient examples, King said Theranos would need to obtain signed releases from each waiving his or her patient-privacy rights. She asked me to help gather the waivers from the patients. I agreed to do so.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，话题转移到我收集到的有问题检测结果。金恩说，Theranos必须先向每个病患取得他们同意签署的「放弃病人隐私权声明」，才能回应我所提的病患个案。她要求我协助向那些病人收集声明，我同意。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I asked about Ian Gibbons. Young acknowledged that Ian had been an important contributor in the company's early years but said his behavior had become erratic at the end of his life and implied that he was no longer in the know at that stage. King interjected, dismissing Gibbons as an alcoholic. Boies, meanwhile, attacked Rochelle Gibbons's credibility by pointing out that she had failed to provide a sworn declaration in the Fuisz case, leading the judge to rule against allowing her testimony at trial.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我问到伊恩．吉本斯的事，杨承认伊恩在早期对Theranos有很重大的贡献，但他说伊恩在过世前的行为变得很古怪，暗示伊恩到那个阶段已经对实际情形了解不多。这时金恩插嘴，把吉本斯贬为只是个酒鬼，同时波伊斯开始攻击罗雪儿．吉本斯的可信度，他指出她在傅伊兹诉讼案拿不出宣誓切结书，导致法官裁定不采用她在法庭上的证词。">查看中文翻译</div>

Rather than scaring him like I worried it might, Alan was fascinated by this new development. He had consulted with a new lawyer, a former federal prosecutor who had worked on the Medicare Fraud Strike Force, and felt less vulnerable to Theranos's intimidation tactics. In fact, he seemed to have changed his mind and to want to resume helping me get the story out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们通上电话，我向他说明几天前在《华尔街日报》跟Theranos代表团开了场马拉松会议。出乎意料，艾伦并没有如同我所担忧的惊恐害怕，反倒对这个新发展很感兴趣。他咨询了新律师，那位律师是前任联邦检察官，曾经隶属于「医疗诈骗打击团队」（Medicare Fraud Strike Force），咨询过后，现在他觉得比较不容易被Theranos的恫吓手段给吓退。事实上，他似乎已经回心转意，想重新协助我做出这篇报导。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was Erika and she seemed badly shaken. She told me about the man in the SUV, the address on the envelope, and the ultimatum from Boies. I tried to calm her down. Yes, it was highly likely she was under surveillance, I admitted. But I was sure that it had started only recently and that Theranos had no proof she was one of my sources. This was an attempt to smoke her out, I said. They were bluffing. I encouraged her to ignore the letter and to go about her business as usual. I could tell from her halting voice that she was still petrified, but she agreed to follow my advice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="是艾芮卡打来的，她似乎发抖得很厉害。她把休旅车男子、信封上的地址、波伊斯的最后通牒一一告诉我，我试着让她平静下来。我承认，没错，她非常可能遭到跟监，但我很确定是最近才开始的，也确定Theranos没有证据可以证明她是我的线人之一，他们这是在引诱她出洞，是虚张声势吓人，我鼓励她不要理会那封信，照常去做平常该做的事。我听得出她连说话都结结巴巴，她吓傻了，不过她答应听从我的建议。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Later that night, an email from Meredith Dearborn landed in my in-box. Attached to it was a formal letter from David Boies addressed to Jay Conti, who was the email's primary recipient. Citing several California statutes, the letter sternly demanded that the Journal "destroy or return" all Theranos trade secrets and confidential information in its possession. Even though Boies must have known there was zero chance we would do that, it was a shot across the bow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那晚稍晚，一封来自梅瑞蒂丝．迪尔波恩的电邮进入我的收件匣。信里有个附件是一封正式信函，寄信人是大卫．波伊斯，收信人是我们的副法务长杰．康提（他是这封信的主要收件人）。那封信引用了好几条加州法规，严正要求《华尔街日报》「销毁或返还」手中所持有的Theranos商业机密与机密数据。波伊斯必定知道我们不可能乖乖照做，但还是发了那封信，警告意味不言可喻。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Any remaining doubts I had that Theranos was waging an aggressive counterattack were put to rest the following Monday morning. I was sitting in my idled car listening to the radio while waiting for the street-sweeping truck to go by -- one of the less pleasant aspects of life in Brooklyn -- when my cell phone rang. I turned the volume down on the car radio and answered.</div>

<div class="line_en">The next day, I received an email from Dr. Sundene in Phoenix. A Theranos sales representative had come by her office to tell her that the company's president, Sunny Balwani, was in town and wanted to meet with her. When she'd declined the invitation, he had turned hostile and suggested that her refusal would have negative consequences. I couldn't believe it. Going after my confidential sources was one thing, but threatening a doctor who had spoken to me on the record was beyond the pale. I sent Heather King an email letting her know that I was aware of the sales representative's visit to Dr. Sundene's office and that, if I learned of any more such incidents, I would consider them newsworthy and would include mention of them in my story. King denied that the sales representative had done anything wrong.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天，我收到凤凰城的桑定医师寄来的电邮。Theranos有个业务代表跑去她办公室告诉她，Theranos的总裁桑尼．包汪尼正在当地，想跟她见一面。她拒绝邀约后，业务代表立刻换上不友善态度，暗示她的拒绝会招来负面后果。我实在不敢相信。追踪我的秘密线人是一回事，但是威胁正式公开接受我采访的医生，就太超过了。我写了封电邮给海瑟．金恩，让她知道我已经知道业务代表去找桑定医师的事，还告诉她，如果我再得知有任何这类事件，我会认为有报导价值，把这些事写进我的报导里。金恩否认那个业务代表有任何不当行为。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Far from backing off, Theranos stepped it up a notch. Later that week, Boies sent the Journal a second letter. Unlike the first one, which was just two pages long, this one ran twenty-three pages and explicitly threatened a lawsuit if we published a story that defamed Theranos or disclosed any of its trade secrets. Much of the letter was a searing assault on my journalistic integrity. In the course of my reporting, I had "fallen far short of being fair, objective, or impartial" and instead appeared hell-bent on "producing a predetermined (and false) narrative," Boies wrote.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="Theranos非但没有收手，还更变本加厉。那周稍晚，波伊斯寄了第二封信给《华尔街日报》，跟第一封只有两页不一样，这次足足有二十三页，赤裸裸地威胁提告，如果我们刊登破坏Theranos的名誉或泄漏任何Theranos商业机密的话。信中大多在猛烈攻击我的新闻道德，说我历年来的报导「远远称不上公正、客观、中立」，而是很明显执意「做出早有定见（而且不实）的陈述」，波伊斯在信中写道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">His main evidence to back up that argument was signed statements Theranos had obtained from two of the other doctors I had spoken to claiming I had mischaracterized what they had told me and hadn't made clear to them that I might use the information in a published article. The doctors were Lauren Beardsley and Saman Rezaie from the Scottsdale practice I'd visited.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他这番说词背后的主要证据，是两份签了名的声明，是Theranos从两位接受我采访的医生那里取得。声明中宣称我曲解了他们对我说的话，还说我没有明白告诉他们，会把他们的采访内容用于公开刊登的报导。那两位医生是萝伦．比尔兹利以及萨曼．瑞札伊，是我去斯科茨代尔采访的一家诊所里面的医生。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I noticed there was no signed statement from Adrienne Stewart, the third doctor I had interviewed at that practice. That was a good thing because I planned on using one or both of the patient cases she had discussed with me. When I reached her by phone, she said that she was visiting family in Indiana and hadn't been present when Theranos representatives came by the practice. I told her about her colleagues' signed statements and warned her that the company would probably try the same heavy-handed tactics with her when she returned.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我发现署名的声明独缺爱卓恩．史都华医师，她是我在那家诊所采访的第三位医生。这是好消息，因为她跟我提过两个病人案例，而我打算引用其中一个或两个都用。我打电话联系她，她说Theranos的代表去诊所时，她人正好到印第安纳州探亲。我跟她说，她的同事签署声明的事，警告她Theranos八成会在她回去之后对她重施这套高压手段。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The truth was that I hadn't planned on using the patient case Drs. Beardsley and Rezaie had told me about because it was a secondhand account. The patient in question was being treated by another doctor in their practice who had declined to speak to me.

<div class="line_cn" title="事实上，我并不打算引用比尔兹利和瑞札伊医师告诉我的病患案例，因为那是二手转述，那位病患本人是由他们诊所另一位医生负责治疗，而那位医生不愿接受我采访。虽然他们签署的声明丝毫不会削弱我的报导，但他们很可能已经屈服于Theranos的压力，这让我忧心忡忡。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When Friday arrived, I tried to check in with Dr. Stewart several times in the morning but couldn't reach her. She called back in the early evening, as I was driving out to eastern Long Island for the weekend with my wife and three kids. She sounded rattled. She told me Balwani had tried to make her sign a statement similar to the one her colleagues had signed, but she had politely refused. Furious, he had threatened to drag her reputation through the mud if she appeared in any Journal article about Theranos. Her voice trembling, she pleaded with me to no longer use her name. As I tried to reassure her that it was an empty threat, it dawned on me that there was nothing these people would stop at to make my story go away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="星期五一到，我早上就试了好几次想跟史都华医师取得联系，但都联系不到。傍晚她回电给我，当时我正开车载着太太和三个小孩要去长岛（Long Island）东边度周末。她听起来很慌乱紧张，她告诉我，包汪尼要她签一份类似她同事所签的声明，但她婉转拒绝，结果包汪尼怒不可遏，扬言她要是出现于《华尔街日报》任何有关Theranos的报导里，就要让她身败名裂。她的声音不断颤抖，哀求我不要使用她的名字，我对她再三保证那是在吓唬人。在那一刻我也充分意识到，为了阻止我的报导，这些人会不择手段。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dr. Stewart emailed a few days later to let me know that Balwani and two other men had indeed come by to speak to her as soon as she'd gotten back to Arizona. The receptionist had told them she was busy with patients, but they had refused to leave and had stayed in the waiting room for hours until she finally came out to shake their hands. They had made her agree to meet with them the following Friday morning, which was in two days. I had a bad feeling about that meeting, but there was nothing I could do about it. Dr. Stewart promised she wouldn't bow to any pressure. She felt it was important to take a stand for her patients and the integrity of lab testing.</div>
