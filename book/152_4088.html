<div class="line_en">When I was a young girl in China, my grandmother told me my mother was a ghost. This did not mean my mother was dead. In those days, a ghost was anything we were forbidden to talk about. So I knew Popo wanted me to forget my mother on purpose, and this is how I came to remember nothing of her. The life that I knew began in the large house in Ningpo with the cold hallways and tall stairs. This was my uncle and auntie's family house, where I lived with Popo and my little brother.</div>

<div class="line_en">All my life, Popo scared me. I became even more scared when she grew sick. This was in 1923, when I was nine years old. Popo had swollen up like an overripe squash, so full her flesh had gone soft and rotten with a bad smell. She would call me into her room with the terrible stink and tell me stories. "An-mei," she said, calling me by my school name. "Listen carefully." She told me stories I could not understand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那是在1923年，那年我九岁。外婆浑身肿胀得像只熟透了的大南瓜。原先丰满富态的她，几乎变成了一堆发臭的烂肉。即便此时，她还要把我叫入她那间臭气熏天的房里，说要讲故事给我听。“安梅，”她说，叫着我的学名，“听着，”这是通常的开场白，但她讲的故事都是希奇古怪的，我一点也听不懂。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But I often heard stories of a ghost who tried to take children away, especially strong-willed little girls who were disobedient. Many times Popo said aloud to all who could hear that my brother and I had fallen out of the bowels of a stupid goose, two eggs that nobody wanted, not even good enough to crack over rice porridge. She said this so that the ghosts would not steal us away. So you see, to Popo we were also very precious.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大人们常给我们讲鬼故事，那种专门要吸孩子血的鬼，特别要抓那种脾气倔，不听话的女孩子。我这一辈子，就怕我外婆，特别后来在她病得很厉害时，那简直令我恐惧之极。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Right before Popo became so sick she could no longer speak, she pulled me close and talked to me about my mother. "Never say her name," she warned. "To say her name is to spit on your father's grave."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当外婆病势加剧，自知将不久于人世时，曾把我唤到病榻前，给我讲了有关我妈妈的事情。“你提也不要提她的名字——永远。一提她的名字，就是对你父亲的亵读。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One was about a greedy girl whose belly grew fatter and fatter. This girl poisoned herself after refusing to say whose child she carried. When the monks cut open her body, they found inside a large white winter melon.</div>

<div class="line_en">Another time, Popo told me about a girl who refused to listen to her elders. One day this bad girl shook her head so vigorously to refuse her auntie's simple request that a little white ball fell from her ear and out poured all her brains, as clear as chicken broth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="还有一个故事，讲的是个不听话的女孩子。一天，这个女孩子又在与姑母闹别扭，只见她拼命地摇头拒绝听姑母的话，忽然，就在她拼命摇头的时候，她耳朵里掉出一团白糊糊的球一样的东西，就这样，她的脑子就这么倒个精打光，就像泼出的鸡汤似的没有了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“这就是所谓的‘没有脑子’，你满脑袋都是自作主张的主意，其他的脑子，就只能给这样泼出去了。”外婆这样告诫着我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The only father I knew was a big painting that hung in the main hall. He was a large, unsmiling man, unhappy to be so still on the wall. His restless eyes followed me around the house. Even from my room at the end of the hall, I could see my father's watching eyes. Popo said he watched me for any signs of disrespect. So sometimes, when I had thrown pebbles at other children at school, or had lost a book through carelessness, I would quickly walk by my father with a know-nothing look and hide in a corner of my room where he could not see my face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我对父亲的全部印象，只是挂在客厅的一幅巨幅画像。一个大个头的，没有一丝笑纹的男人，终日间郁郁不欢地寂寞地挂在墙上。他那对忧心忡忡的双目，总是跟着我的身影转。从大厅直至我自己的房间，我似都能感觉到他那对窥视的目光。外婆说，他是在注意我有否失礼和淘气。所以每逢我在学校里扔过小石子、或者不留神丢失了一本书或什么，我便会心急慌忙地机械地窜过父亲画像跟前，然后回房躲在角落里，心想这样他将看不见我了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">My auntie, who had a very bad temper with children, told him he had no shou, no respect for ancestors or family, just like our mother. Auntie had a tongue like hungry scissors eating silk cloth. So when my brother gave her a sour look, Auntie said our mother was so thoughtless she had fled north in a big hurry, without taking the dowry furniture from her marriage to my father, without bringing her ten pairs of silver chopsticks, without paying respect to my father's grave and those of our ancestors. When my brother accused Auntie of frightening our mother away, Auntie shouted that our mother had married a man named Wu Tsing who already had a wife, two concubines, and other bad children.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="舅母对待孩子，向来粗暴得很。我弟弟不服地瞪了她一眼，她马上训斥他目无尊长，如此大逆不道的行为，就像我们妈妈。舅母的舌头不住地掀动着，就像一把锋利的小刀。她滔滔不绝地数落着我母亲，说她竟是如此糊涂，那样急不可待地跑到北方去嫁人，急得连自己陪嫁的那十副银筷子都不带。这是丢脸，败坏祖坟的风水。弟弟则指责舅母，说是她把母亲给唬走的。舅母即刻破口大骂，说什么我妈跟了个叫吴青的人走了，那男人早已有了老婆，还有两个姨太太，并且已有了一大堆孬种。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But even my brother's happiness went away. One hot summer day when Popo was already very sick, we stood outside watching a village funeral procession marching by our courtyard. Just as it passed our gate, the heavy framed picture of the dead man toppled from its stand and fell to the dusty ground. An old lady screamed and fainted. My brother laughed and Auntie slapped him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，他也很快就不再快活了。在一个酷暑季节，外婆已经病得很厉害，我和弟弟在门外看热闹，一家邻居正在大出殡，当他们走过我家门口时，那位死者的照片突然从座上掉到尘土埃埃的地上，一个老太太当即大叫一声，晕了过去，弟弟见状哈哈大笑，舅母即时给了他一个耳刮子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I felt our house was so unhappy, but my little brother did not seem to think so. He rode his bicycle through the courtyard, chasing chickens and other children, laughing over which ones shrieked the loudest. Inside the quiet house, he jumped up and down on Uncle and Auntie's best feather sofas when they were away visiting village friends.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我深深觉得，我们的家，是如此的压抑和不快，但我的弟弟却对此浑然不觉。他在院子里骑自行车，追逐小鸡，和小朋友们嬉闹，大声喧闹着尖叫着，寂静的房子里，数他最闹，只要瞅着舅舅和舅母出去，他就在他们很好的丝绒沙发上窜跳践踏。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="舅母那番责骂，令我总算领悟了外婆为什么要给我讲那些故事，那是因为我的母亲，我才有了这样的必修课。“当你把脸丢了，安梅，”外婆常这么对我说，“就好比你把项链给掉进井里了，唯一能挽回它的办法就是，跟着跳进去。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now I could imagine my mother, a thoughtless woman who laughed and shook her head, who dipped her chopsticks many times to eat another piece of sweet fruit, happy to be free of Popo, her unhappy husband on the wall, and her two disobedient children.

<div class="line_en">I was sitting at the top of the stairs when she arrived. I knew it was my mother even though I had seen her in all my memory. She stood just inside the doorway so that her face became a dark shadow. She was much taller than my auntie, almost as tall as my uncle. She looked strange, too, like the missionary ladies at our school who were insolent and bossy in their too-tall shoes, foreign clothes, and short hair.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天妈妈突然出现时，我正好坐在楼梯顶上，我立刻知道，这是妈妈！虽然记忆中，我对她一点也没印象了。当时，她站在过道里，因此她的脸庞是一团阴影。她的个子比我舅母要高得多，几乎与我舅舅一样高。她整个仪态举止也很让我觉得新奇，有点像我们学校教会里的女人，只见她穿着一身西服，剪着短发，穿着细脚伶什的高跟鞋，傲慢自信地站在那儿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Come back, stay here," murmured my mother to Popo. "Nuyer is here. Your daughter is back." Popo's eyes were open, but now her mind ran in many different directions, not staying long enough to see anything. If Popo's mind had been clear she would have raised her two arms and flung my mother out of the room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我回来了，再也不走了，”妈凑着外婆耳边轻声说，“你的女儿回来了。”外婆的眼睛睁了睁，但她的意识，已飘离得很远很远，再也回不来了。如果此时我外婆的神智正常的话，我想她也许会把我妈赶出去的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My auntie quickly looked away and did not call her by name or offer her tea. An old servant hurried away with a displeased look. I tried to keep very still, but my heart felt like crickets scratching to get out of a cage. My mother must have heard, because she looked up. And when she did, I saw my own face looking back at me. Eyes that stayed wide open and saw too much.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="舅母瞟了她一眼后，就再也不答理她，既不招呼她入座，也不给她泡茶，一个多年的老妈子实在看不过去，只好快快地退了下去。我努力让自己沉住气，然而心里却像兜着个蟋蟀，七上八下的。妈妈一定听到了我心跳声，只见她抬头张望了一下，瞬间，我的灵魂似乎出了窍，它脱离了我的躯壳躲在一侧，清清楚楚地在窥视自己那目瞪口呆的模样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I watched my mother, seeing her for the first time, this pretty woman with her white skin and oval face, not too round like Auntie's or sharp like Popo's. I saw that she had a long white neck, just like the goose that had laid me. That she seemed to float back and forth like a ghost, dipping cool cloths to lay on Popo's bloated face. As she peered into Popo's eyes, she clucked soft worried sounds. I watched her carefully, yet it was her voice that confused me, a familiar sound from a forgotten dream.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我盯着母亲打量，这是自她离开后我第一次见到她。她很漂亮，鹅蛋形的脸庞白皙细嫩，既不像舅母那样扁圆也不属外婆那样瘦削。她有着一个颀长嫩白的脖子，优雅起伏的线条，令我联想起天鹅的颈脖。她像幽灵一样，无声无息地从房间这头飘到那头，轻盈啊娜。她不住地把毛巾绞湿后，轻轻覆盖在外婆肿胀的脸庞上。望着外婆那半闭的、呆呆地凝然不动的双目，母亲不禁深深叹了口气。我全神贯注地盯着她，只觉得她的嗓音是那样熟悉。我有点恍惚了：我依稀记得在哪儿听见过这样的声音，它仿佛来自一个被遗忘的梦境。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She stopped brushing. And then I could feel her long smooth fingers rubbing and searching under my chin, finding the spot that was my smooth-neck scar. As she rubbed this spot, I became very still. It was as though she were rubbing the memory back into my skin. And then her hand dropped and she began to cry, wrapping her hands around her own neck. She cried with a wailing voice that was so sad. And then I remembered the dream with my mother's voice.</div>

<div class="line_en">In two years' time, my scar became pale and shiny and I had no memory of my mother. That is the way it is with a wound. The wound begins to close in on itself, to protect what is hurting so much. And once it is closed, you no longer see what is underneath, what started the pain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="整整两年，我的颈脖上，显着一道苍白浮亮的疤痕。而我对母亲的记忆，却消失得无影无踪了。我生活中的一道伤口，就这样愈合了，收口了。谁也看不见它底下埋着什么样的痛苦，谁也不知道那痛苦的起因来自哪里。伤疤，是痛苦的终止。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Every night I cried so that both my eyes and my neck burned. Next to my bed sat Popo. She would pour cool water over my neck from the hollowed cup of a large grapefruit. She would pour and pour until my breathing became soft and I could fall asleep. In the morning, Popo would use her sharp fingernails like tweezers and peel off the dead membranes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每晚每晚我都在哭，哭得眼睛和颈脖火辣辣地生疼，外婆则坐在床边，不断将凉水泼在我的颈脖上，泼呀泼呀，直到我的呼吸开始变得均匀平缓，而且，我开始能入睡了。次日早上，外婆用她留得尖尖的长指甲，像小镊子样、轻轻揭去伤口上的痴片。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I worshipped this mother from my dream. But the woman standing by Popo's bed was not the mother of my memory. Yet I came to love this mother as well. Not because she came to me and begged me to forgive her. She did not. She did not need to explain that Popo chased her out of the house when I was dying. This I knew. She did not need to tell me she married Wu Tsing to exchange one unhappiness for another. I knew this as well.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，眼前这个站在外婆床边的母亲，与我梦中的妈妈，却是这样的截然不同。但是，我开始逐渐爱上跟前这个妈妈了。倒并不是因为她来这里恳求我的原谅，事实上，她也没有这样做。她无需向我解释，为什么我濒于死亡时，她不来看望我，那是外婆阻拦着她，这一点我理解。她也无需告诉我，她嫁给了吴青，由一个不快乐的境地转到另一个不快乐的境地，这点，我也明了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was late at night when I went to Popo's room. My auntie said it was Popo's dying time and I must show respect. I put on a clean dress and stood between my auntie and uncle at the foot of Popo's bed. I cried a little, not too loud.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="夜深了，我被叫进外婆的房间。舅妈说，外婆快走了，我必须尽尽孝心。我换上一件干净的衣服，站在外婆脚跟前，在舅舅和舅母之间。我轻轻地抽泣着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My mother took her flesh and put it in the soup. She cooked magic in the ancient tradition to try to cure her mother this one last time. She opened Popo's mouth, already too tight from trying to keep her spirit in. She fed her this soup, but that night Popo flew away with her illness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="妈妈把从手臂上割下的那片肉放入药汤里，就像古代的巫婆样，希冀着用一种未可知的法术，来为自己的母亲，尽最后一次的孝心。妈妈设法撬开外婆已经紧闭了的嘴唇，把汤药给喂了进去。但是当晚，外婆还是走了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I saw my mother on the other side of the room. Quiet and sad. She was cooking a soup, pouring herbs and medicines into the steaming pot. And then I saw her pull up her sleeve and pull out a sharp knife. She put this knife on the softest part of her arm. I tried to close my eyes, but could not.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="房间那头，妈妈独处一边，默默地伤心着。她正在照料一锅汤药，炉子上，汤药沸滚着，散发着一股草药味。猛地，只见她挽起衣袖，拿起一把锋利的小刀，搁在自己的手臂上，我不敢睁眼看她。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This is how a daughter honors her mother. It is shou so deep it is in your bones. The pain of the flesh is nothing. The pain you must forget. Because sometimes that is the only way to remember what is in your bones. You must peel off your skin, and that of your mother, and her mother before her. Until there is nothing. No scar, no skin, no flesh.</div>
