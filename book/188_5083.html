<div class="line_cn" title="“先生，不对，我没有。”安迪冷静地说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, I did not," Andy answered. By midnight, he said, he was sobering up. He was also feeling the first signs of a bad hangover. He decided to go home and sleep it off and think about the whole thing in a more adult fashion the next day. "At that time, as I drove home, I was beginning to think that the wisest course would be to simply let her go to Reno and get her divorce."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没有，我没有。”安迪回答。他说，到了午夜，他逐渐清醒过来，同时宿醉的感觉开始让他不舒服。于是他决定回家，睡一觉后，第二天再像个大人般好好冷静地想一想，“当我开车回家时，我开始觉得，最好的办法还是就让她去雷诺办离婚吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“这无所谓巧不巧合，是事实罢了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No," Andy said, "but you don't impress me as being terribly sensitive, and I doubt very much that, if I were feeling suicidal, I would take my problem to you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不会，”安迪说，“不过你看起来也不像特别敏感的那种人。如果我真的想自杀，大概也不会找你谈我心里的苦闷。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="庭上一阵窃笑，但他这番话并不能赢得陪审团的同情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, sir."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，先生。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Then you heard him testify that they found no gun, although they dragged for three days. That was rather convenient, too, wasn't it?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那么你听到他告诉法庭，他们虽然找了三天，还是没找到枪。你这么说，不是太取巧了吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, yes!" The DA smiled sarcastically. "You threw it into the river, didn't you? The Royal River. On the afternoon of 9 September."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦！对了！”检察官讽刺地微笑道，“你把它扔进河里了，是吗？在九月九日的下午，扔进皇家河中。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"And so no comparison can be made between the riflings on the bullets taken from the bloodstained corpses of your wife and Mr Glenn Quentin and the riflings on the barrel of your gun. That's correct, isn't it, Mr Dufresne?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“因此也就无法比对你手枪中的子弹，以及射入你太太和昆丁先生浑身是血的身体中的子弹了，是吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The DA hammered at him for two days. He re-read the Handy-Pik clerk's testimony about the dishtowels to Andy. Andy repeated that he could not recall buying them, but admitted that he also couldn't remember not buying them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="检察官炮火猛烈地质问了他两天，把便利商店店员的证词中有关擦碗布的部分重新念一遍。安迪反复说明他记不得曾经买过擦碗布，但也承认他记不得没买过擦碗布。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Convenience aside, it's a fact that they didn't find the gun," Andy responded calmly. "But I should like to point out to both you and the jury that the Pond Road Bridge is very close to where the Royal River empties into the Bay of Yarmouth. The current is strong. The gun may have been carried out into the bay itself."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不管巧不巧，他们没找到枪是事实，”安迪冷静道，“但我要跟你、还有陪审团说明一件事：庞德路桥很靠近皇家河的出海口，那里水流很急，枪也许被冲到海湾中了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At that, according to the papers, Andy displayed one of the few slight emotional reactions he allowed himself during the entire six-week period of the trial. A slight, bitter smile crossed his face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="按照当时报纸的记载，安迪听到他这么说时，脸上浮现出一丝苦笑，整整六个星期的审判过程中，这是安迪不多见的情绪反应之一。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That's also rather convenient, isn't it?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这不也很巧吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Since I am innocent of this crime, sir, and since I am telling the truth about throwing my gun into the river the day before the crime took place, then it seems to me decidedly inconvenient that the gun was never found."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“由于我是无辜的，再加上当我说我把枪丢入河里时，我说的是实话，因此找不到枪，对我而言，其实是很不巧的。”安迪说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Was it true that Andy and Linda Dufresne had taken out a joint insurance policy in early 1947? Yes, that was true. And if acquitted, wasn't it true that Andy stood to gain $50,000 in benefits? True. And wasn't it true that he had gone up to Glenn Quentin's house with murder in his heart, and wasn't it also true that he had indeed committed murder twice over? No, it was not true. Then what did he think had happened, since there had been no signs of robbery?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="安迪和琳达于一九四七年初合买过保险，是吗？是的。如果安迪无罪开释，是否可以得到五万元的保险理赔？是的。那么他前往昆丁的屋子时，不是抱着杀人的打算？打算杀了自己的妻子和昆丁？不是。如果不是的话，那么他认为那天到底发生了什么事，因为这个案子不像劫财害命。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I have no way of knowing that, sir," Andy said quietly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“先生，我完全想不透发生了什么事。”安迪静静地说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The case went to the jury at one p. m. on a snowy Wednesday afternoon. The twelve jurymen and women came back at three-thirty. The bailiff said they would have been back earlier, but they had held off in order to enjoy a nice chicken dinner from Bentley's Restaurant at the county's expense. They found him guilty, and brother, if Maine had the death penalty, he would have done the airdance before that spring's crocuses poked their heads out of the dirt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这案子在一个大雪纷飞的星期三下午一点钟，交付陪审团表决。十二位陪审员在三点半回到庭上。法警说，他们原本可以早一点返回法庭，但是为了能享受一顿从班特利餐厅买来、由公家招待的免费鸡肉大餐，而拖了一点时间。陪审团判定安迪有罪。各位，如果缅因州有死刑的话，他会在番红花还未从雪中冒出头之前上了西天。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The DA had asked him what he thought had happened, and Andy slipped the question -- but he did have an idea, and I got it out of him late one evening in 1955. It had taken those seven years for us to progress from nodding acquaintances to fairly close friends -- but I never felt really close to Andy until 1960 or so, and I believe I was the only one who ever did get really close to him. Both being long-timers, we were in the same cellblock from beginning to end, although I was halfway down the corridor from him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="检察官问过安迪，他认为那天晚上到底发生了什么事，安迪避而不答。但他其实心中的确有一些想法，我在一九五五年一个黄昏时把这些想法套出来。我们两人花了七年工夫，才从点头之交进而成为相当亲近的朋友，但直到一九六年之前，我都从未真正感到跟他很接近。而且我想，我是惟一曾经真正跟他接近的人。我们由始至终都在同一层囚室，只是我在走道中间而他在走道末端。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"What do I think?" He laughed -- but there was no humour in the sound. "I think there was a lot of bad luck floating around that night. More than could ever get together in the same short span of time again. I think it must have been some stranger, just passing through. Maybe someone who had a flat tyre on that road after I went home. Maybe a burglar. Maybe a psychopath. He killed them, that's all. And I'm here."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我认为到底是怎么回事？”他笑道，但笑声中没有丝毫幽默的意味，“我认为那天晚上，我真是倒霉透了，古往今来最倒霉的事都集中在这短短几小时内发生。我想一定有个陌生人凑巧经过。也许在我走了之后，有人车子爆胎了，也许是个强盗，也许是个神经病，走进去把他们杀了，就这样，我就被关进来了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As simple as that. And he was condemned to spend the rest of his life in Shawshank or the part of it that mattered. Five years later he began to have parole hearings, and he was turned down just as regular as clockwork in spite of being a model prisoner. Getting a pass out of Shawshank when you've got murder stamped on your admittance-slip is slow work, as slow as a river eroding a rock. Seven men sit on the board, two more than at most state prisons, and every one of those seven has an ass as hard as the water drawn up from a mineral-spring well. You can't buy those guys, you can't no, you can't cry for them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就这么简单。而他却得下半辈子——至少在离得开以前——都待在肖申克。五年后，他开始申请假释，但每次都被驳回，尽管他是模范犯人。但当你被烙上了谋杀的罪名后，想离开肖申克可有得等了，慢得就像流水侵蚀岩石一样。假释听证会中有七个委员，比一般州立监狱还多两个，你不能收买那些家伙，也无法用甜言蜜语哄他们，更不能向他们哭求。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As far as the board concerned, money don't talk, and nobody walks. Pc other reasons in Andy's case as well… but that belongs a little further along in my story.</div>
