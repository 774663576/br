<div class="line_en">Areo Hotah ran his hand along the smooth shaft of his longaxe, his ash-and-iron wife, all the while watching. He watched the white knight, Ser Balon Swann, and the others who had come with him. He watched the Sand Snakes, each at a different table. He watched the lords and ladies, the serving men, the old blind seneschal, and the young maester Myles, with his silky beard and servile smile. Standing half in light and half in shadow, he saw all of them. Serve. Protect. Obey. That was his task.</div>

<div class="line_en">All the rest had eyes only for the chest. It was carved of ebony, with silver clasps and hinges. A fine-looking box, no doubt, but many of those assembled here in the Old Palace of Sunspear might soon be dead, depending on what was in that chest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其他所有人都盯着那个盒子。它是乌木雕刻的，带有银扣和铰链。盒子毫无疑问十分好看，只是今天汇聚在阳戟城旧王宫里的人们或许很快就要性命不保了，他们的生死取决于盒子里究竟是什么东西。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His slippers whispering against the floor, Maester Caleotte crossed the hall to Ser Balon Swann. The round little man looked splendid in his new robes, with their broad bands of dun and butternut and narrow stripes of red. Bowing, he took the chest from the hands of the white knight and carried it to the dais, where Doran Martell sat in his rolling chair between his daughter Arianne and his dead brother's beloved paramour, Ellaria. A hundred scented candles perfumed the air. Gemstones glittered on the fingers of the lords and the girdles and hairnets of the ladies. Areo Hotah had polished his shirt of copper scales mirror-bright so he would blaze in the candlelight as well.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随着拖鞋在地上的轻擦声，卡洛特学士穿过大厅向巴隆·史文爵士走去。这个矮小发福的人穿着一件暗胡桃色宽条纹和红色窄条纹相间的新袍子，看起来容光焕发。他弯腰鞠躬，从白骑士手里取走盒子，捧着走上高台。道朗·马泰尔坐在轮椅中，左右手边分别是他的女儿亚莲恩和他过世弟弟的心爱情妇艾拉莉亚。一百只芳香蜡烛正在燃烧，让空气中充满芬芳。戴在领主们指间、嵌在女士们腰带和发网上的颗颗宝石都在闪闪发光。阿利欧·何塔已经把他的铜鳞甲打摩得跟镜子一样亮，如此他也在摇曳的烛光中闪烁起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ser Balon Swann was taut as a drawn bow, the captain of guards observed. This new white knight was not so tall nor comely as the old one, but he was bigger across the chest, burlier, his arms thick with muscle. His snowy cloak was clasped at the throat by two swans on a silver brooch. One was ivory, the other onyx, and it seemed to Areo Hotah as if the two of them were fighting. The man who wore them looked a fighter too. This one will not die so easy as the other. He will not charge into my axe the way Ser Arys did. He will stand behind his shield and make me come at him. If it came to that, Hotah would be ready. His longaxe was sharp enough to shave with.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="巴隆·史文爵士像一把上了弦的弓一样绷紧全身，侍卫队长注意到。这位白骑士不若之前那位那样高挑英俊，但是他的胸膛更宽阔、更厚实，手臂满是肌肉。他的雪白袍子靠一双天鹅银别针固定在喉头，一只天鹅是象牙做的，另一只则是玛瑙。在阿利欧·何塔看来，两只天鹅就像在打斗。戴着它们的人也全然是个战士。这一个不会像另一个那样轻易被杀死。他不会像亚历斯爵士那样撞上我的斧头。他会用盾牌保护自己，迫使我主动攻击他。如果事情真的发展到这个地步，何塔也会欣然应战。他的长柄斧时刻都锋利得可以挥舞。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A hush had fallen across the hall. Dorne holds its breath. Maester Caleotte set the box on the floor beside Prince Doran's chair. The maester's fingers, normally so sure and deft, turned clumsy as he worked the latch and opened the lid, to reveal the skull within. Hotah heard someone clear his throat. One of the Fowler twins whispered something to the other. Ellaria Sand had closed her eyes and was murmuring a prayer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一声安静的嘘声划过大厅。整个多恩都屏住呼吸。卡洛特学士把盒子放在道朗亲王轮椅旁边的地上。学士的双手一向坚定利落，在解开闩锁、打开盖子、露出其中头骨的时刻却变得如此笨拙。何塔听见有人在清喉咙。佛勒双胞胎中的一个在跟另一个耳语。艾拉莉亚·沙德闭上眼睛，轻声祈祷。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The pedestal was a column of black marble three feet taller than Maester Caleotte. The fat little maester hopped up on his toes but still could not quite reach. Areo Hotah was about to go and help him, but Obara Sand moved first. Even without her whip and shield, she had an angry mannish look to her. In place of a gown, she wore men's breeches and a calf-length linen tunic, cinched at the waist with a belt of copper suns. Her brown hair was tied back in a knot. Snatching the skull from the maester's soft pink hands, she placed it up atop the marble column.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="台座是一根黑色大理石柱，比卡洛特学士高出三尺。矮胖的学士踮起脚来也够不着。阿利欧·何塔正准备去帮他一把，但奥芭娅·沙德先站起身来了。即便少了鞭子和圆盾，她看起来还是愤怒又男性化。她不穿裙服，而穿着男人的马裤和一件到小腿长度的亚麻紧身装，腰间缠着一条铜制的太阳腰带，褐色的头发往脑后扎成一个结。她从学士柔软的双手中一把夺过头骨，放在高高的大理石柱顶端。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He allowed himself a brief glance at the chest. The skull rested on a bed of black felt, grinning. All skulls grinned, but this one seemed happier than most. And bigger. The captain of guards had never seen a larger skull. Its brow shelf was thick and heavy, its jaw massive. The bone shone in the candlelight, white as Ser Balon's cloak. "Place it on the pedestal," the prince commanded. He had tears glistening in his eyes.</div>

<div class="line_en">"He screamed for days, my lady," the white knight replied, though it was plain that it pleased him little to say so. "We could hear him all over the Red Keep."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他日日惨叫，小姐。”白骑士回答，但显然他并不乐意给出这样的答案，“整个红堡都能听到他的叫声。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Was his dying long and hard, Ser Balon?" asked Tyene Sand, in the tone a maiden might use to ask if her gown was pretty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他是不是死得又缓慢又痛苦呢，巴隆爵士？”特蕾妮·沙德的问话语气就像一个少女在询问她的裙服漂不漂亮。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Does that trouble you, ser?" asked the Lady Nym. She wore a gown of yellow silk so sheer and fine that the candles shone right through it to reveal the spun gold and jewels beneath. So immodest was her garb that the white knight seemed uncomfortable looking at her, but Hotah approved. Nymeria was least dangerous when nearly naked. Elsewise she was sure to have a dozen blades concealed about her person. "Ser Gregor was a bloody brute, all men agree. If ever a man deserved to suffer, it was him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这让你感到困扰了吗，爵士？”娜梅小姐问。她穿着一件黄色丝裙，裙子太过华美通透，让烛光能够照出她里面穿戴的金丝和宝石。她的穿着如此放荡，令白骑士在注视她的时候浑身不舒服。不过何塔赞许这一点，光着身子的娜梅莉亚是最不危险的，其他时候她将把一打匕首藏在身边。“格雷果爵士是只血腥的野兽，大家都知道。如果有人活该痛苦至死，那么非他莫属。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Lady Tyene smiled at that. Her gown was cream and green, with long lace sleeves, so modest and so innocent that any man who looked at her might think her the most chaste of maids. Areo Hotah knew better. Her soft, pale hands were as deadly as Obara's callused ones, if not more so. He watched her carefully, alert to every little flutter of her fingers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特蕾妮小姐被他逗乐了。她的裙服是乳白和绿色，有长长的蕾丝袖子。她看起来如此贤淑纯真，任何看到她的男人都会认为她是天下最纯洁的少女。可阿利欧·何塔知道真相。特蕾妮轻柔白皙的小手就跟奥芭娅那双老茧遍布的手一样危险，甚至有过之而无不及。他仔细地观察她，对她指尖任何一点小小动作都充满警觉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That is as it may be, my lady," said Balon Swann, "but Ser Gregor was a knight, and a knight should die with sword in hand. Poison is a foul and filthy way to kill."</div>

<div class="line_en">Serving men had begun to move amongst the guests as the seneschal was speaking, filling cups from the flagons that they bore. The wine was Dornish strongwine, dark as blood and sweet as vengeance. The captain did not drink of it. He never drank at feasts. Nor did the prince himself partake. He had his own wine, prepared by Maester Myles and well laced with poppy juice to ease the agony in his swollen joints.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在管家祝酒时，侍者们已开始在宾客中穿梭服务，用酒壶为杯中添满美酒。酒是多恩陈红酒，深红如血，甜如复仇。侍卫队长滴酒未沾，他在宴会上从不饮酒。亲王也不喝，他有自己的酒——由迈尔斯学士调制，加入了罂粟花汁液，令他肿胀的关节减轻些疼痛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Prince Doran frowned. "That is so, Ser Balon, but the Lady Nym is right. If ever a man deserved to die screaming, it was Gregor Clegane. He butchered my good sister, smashed her babe's head against a wall. I only pray that now he is burning in some hell, and that Elia and her children are at peace. This is the justice that Dorne has hungered for. I am glad that I lived long enough to taste it. At long last the Lannisters have proved the truth of their boast and paid this old blood debt."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="道朗亲王皱起眉头：“话虽如此，巴隆爵士。可娜梅小姐是正确的，如果有谁活该惨叫至死，非格雷果·克里冈莫属。他屠杀了我的妹妹，将她的孩子一头撞在墙上。我祈祷他现在在地狱里被火焚烧，然后伊莉亚和她的孩子们终于可以安息。这正是多恩渴求了多年的正义。我很欣慰我能活着看到这一天。那么多年来，兰尼斯特终于证明了他们说的不是大话，还了这笔旧血债。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Chief amongst those were the Sand Snakes, the bastard daughters of the prince's late brother Oberyn, the Red Viper, three of whom were at the feast. Doran Martell was the wisest of princes, and it was not the place of his captain of guards to question his decisions, but Areo Hotah did wonder why he had chosen to release the ladies Obara, Nymeria, and Tyene from their lonely cells in the Spear Tower.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们之中为首的便是沙蛇，亲王已逝弟弟红毒蛇奥柏伦的私生女儿们。三条沙蛇就坐在这宴会上。道朗·马泰尔是亲王中最有智慧的一位，侍卫队长没资格质疑他的决定。但阿利欧·何塔确实纳闷亲王为何要将奥芭娅、娜梅莉亚和特蕾妮从尖塔（Spear Tower）的单人牢房里释放出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The white knight did drink, as was only courteous. His companions likewise. So did the Princess Arianne, Lady Jordayne, the Lord of Gods-grace, the Knight of Lemonwood, the Lady of Ghost Hill… even Ellaria Sand, Prince Oberyn's beloved paramour, who had been with him in King's Landing when he died. Hotah paid more note to those who did not drink: Ser Daemon Sand, Lord Tremond Gargalen, the Fowler twins, Dagos Manwoody, the Ullers of the Hellholt, the Wyls of the Boneway. If there is trouble, it could start with one of them. Dorne was an angry and divided land, and Prince Doran's hold on it was not as firm as it might be. Many of his own lords thought him weak and would have welcomed open war with the Lannisters and the boy king on the Iron Throne.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="白骑士喝了，只是出于礼节。他的随行人马如法效仿。参与酒宴的还有亚莲恩公主、乔戴妮女士（Lady Jordayne）、神恩城领主、柠檬林骑士、幽灵谷女士（the Lady of Ghost Hill）…甚至艾拉莉亚·沙德——奥柏伦亲王心爱的情妇——她陪伴奥柏伦到君临，并目睹了他的死亡。阿利欧·何塔对没喝酒的人加以更多关注：戴蒙·沙德爵士、托蒙德·加加兰老爷（Lord Tremond Gargalen）、佛勒双胞胎、达苟士·曼伍笛、狱林堡的乌勒斯（the Ullers of the Hellholt）、骨路的威里斯（the Wyls of the Boneway）。如果有谁想搞出点麻烦，可能就在这些人之中。多恩是一片愤怒而独立的土地，道朗亲王对它的掌控并不像理想中那么坚固。他的许多封臣认为他懦弱无能，乐意与兰尼斯特家族和铁王座上的小男孩打一场公开的战争。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tyene declined Ricasso's toast with a murmur and Lady Nym with a flick of a hand. Obara let them fill her cup to the brim, then upended it to spill the red wine on the floor. When a serving girl knelt to wipe up the spilled wine, Obara left the hall. After a moment Princess Arianne excused herself and went after her. Obara would never turn her rage on the little princess, Hotah knew. They are cousins, and she loves her well.</div>

<div class="line_en">The feast continued late into the night, presided over by the grinning skull on its pillar of black marble. Seven courses were served, in honor of the seven gods and the seven brothers of the Kingsguard. The soup was made with eggs and lemons, the long green peppers stuffed with cheese and onions. There were lamprey pies, capons glazed with honey, a whiskerfish from the bottom of the Greenblood that was so big it took four serving men to carry it to table. After that came a savory snake stew, chunks of seven different sorts of snake slow-simmered with dragon peppers and blood oranges and a dash of venom to give it a good bite. The stew was fiery hot, Hotah knew, though he tasted none of it. Sherbet followed, to cool the tongue. For the sweet, each guest was served a skull of spun sugar. When the crust was broken, they found sweet custard inside and bits of plum and cherry.</div>

<div class="line_en">Princess Arianne returned in time for the stuffed peppers. My little princess, Hotah thought, but Arianne was a woman now. The scarlet silks she wore left no doubt of that. Of late she had changed in other ways as well. Her plot to crown Myrcella had been betrayed and smashed, her white knight had perished bloodily at Hotah's hand, and she herself had been confined to the Spear Tower, condemned to solitude and silence. All of that had chastened her. There was something else as well, though, some secret her father had confided in her before releasing her from her confinement. What that was, the captain did not know.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="亚莲恩公主回来的时候正赶上酿青椒上桌。我的小公主，何塔心想。但亚莲恩已经是个女人了，深红色丝绸衬托出她姣好的身材。最近她在其他方面也有所变化：她为弥赛菈加冕的计划被出卖、被扑灭；她的白骑士在何塔手上血淋淋地殒命；她自己被关进尖塔，与孤独沉默为伴。所有这一切都惩罚着她。不过，还有些其他情况：在她被释放之前，她的父亲向她吐露了一些秘密。至于是什么秘密，侍卫队长不知道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The prince had placed his daughter between himself and the white knight, a place of high honor. Arianne smiled as she slipped into her seat again, and murmured something in Ser Balon's ear. The knight did not choose to respond. He ate little, Hotah observed: a spoon of soup, a bite of the pepper, the leg off a capon, some fish. He shunned the lamprey pie and tried only one small spoonful of the stew. Even that made his brow break out in sweat. Hotah could sympathize. When first he came to Dorne, the fiery food would tie his bowels in knots and burn his tongue. That was years ago, however; now his hair was white, and he could eat anything a Dornishman could eat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="亲王把女儿的座位安排在他自己和白骑士之间，这是个至高的荣誉。亚莲恩微笑着溜回自己的座位上，跟巴隆爵士窃窃私语，白骑士没有作答。他几乎没吃什么东西，何塔观察着：一勺汤，一口青椒，一根阉鸡腿，一点鱼，他跳过鳗鱼馅饼，炖肉也只尝了一小勺。不过只那一小勺就让他额头直冒汗。何塔感同身受，当他初次抵达多恩时，辛辣的食物让他的肠子都打结，火焰在他舌头上燃烧。不过那是陈年往事了，现在他头发花白，吃得像任何一个多恩人一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When the spun-sugar skulls were served, Ser Balon's mouth grew tight, and he gave the prince a lingering look to see if he was being mocked. Doran Martell took no notice, but his daughter did. "It is the cook's little jape, Ser Balon," said Arianne. "Even death is not sacred to a Dornishmen. You won't be cross with us, I pray?" She brushed the back of the white knight's hand with her fingers. "I hope you have enjoyed your time in Dorne."</div>

<div class="line_en">Ser Balon gave a nod and sipped his wine. This one is not so easily seduced as was his Sworn Brother, Hotah thought. Ser Arys was a boy, despite his years. This one is a man, and wary. The captain had only to look at him to see that the white knight was ill at ease. This place is strange to him, and little to his liking. Hotah could understand that. Dorne had seemed a queer place to him as well when first he came here with his own princess, many years ago. The bearded priests had drilled him on the Common Speech of Westeros before they sent him forth, but the Dornishmen all spoke too quickly for him to understand.

<div class="line_en">Ser Balon's journey had been shorter but troubling in its own way, the captain knew. Three knights, eight squires, twenty men-at-arms, and sundry grooms and servants had accompanied him from King's Landing, but once they crossed the mountains into Dorne their progress had been slowed by a round of feasts, hunts, and celebrations at every castle that they chanced to pass. And now that they had reached Sunspear, neither Princess Myrcella nor Ser Arys Oakheart was on hand to greet them. The white knight knows that something is amiss, Hotah could tell, but it is more than that. Perhaps the presence of the Sand Snakes unnerved him. If so, Obara's return to the hall must have been vinegar in the wound. She slipped back into her place without a word, and sat there sullen and scowling, neither smiling nor speaking.</div>

One of my ancestors had them built to please his Targaryen bride and free her from the dust and heat of Sunspear. Daenerys was her name. She was sister to King Daeron the Good, and it was her marriage that made Dorne part of the Seven Kingdoms. The whole realm knew that the girl loved Daeron's bastard brother Daemon Black-fyre, and was loved by him in turn, but the king was wise enough to see that the good of thousands must come before the desires of two, even if those two were dear to him. It was Daenerys who filled the gardens with laughing children. Her own children at the start, but later the sons and daughters of lords and landed knights were brought in to be companions to the boys and girls of princely blood. And one summer's day when it was scorching hot, she took pity on the children of her grooms and cooks and serving men and invited them to use the pools and fountains too, a tradition that has endured till this day."</div>

As the children splashed in the pools, Daenerys watched from amongst the orange trees, and a realization came to her. She could not tell the high-born from the low. Naked, they were only children. All innocent, all vulnerable, all deserving of long life, love, protection. 'There is your realm,' she told her son and heir, 'remember them, in everything you do.' My own mother said those same words to me when I was old enough to leave the pools. It is an easy thing for a prince to call the spears, but in the end the children pay the price. For their sake, the wise prince will wage no war without good cause, nor any war he cannot hope to win.</div>
