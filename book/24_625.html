<div class="line_en">The volcano that had reared Taratua up from the Pacific depths had been sleeping now for half a million years. Yet in a little while, thought Reinhold, the island would be bathed with fires fiercer than any that had attended its birth. He glanced towards the launching site, and his gaze climbed the pyramid of scaffolding that still surrounded the "Columbus". Two hundred feet above the ground, the ship's prow was catching the last rays of the descending sun. This was one of the last nights it would ever know; soon it would be floating in the eternal sunshine of space.</div>

<div class="line_en">A mile beyond the reef, the "James Forrestal" had switched on her searchlights and was sweeping the dark waters. The sun had now vanished completely, and the swift tropical night was racing in from the east. Reinhold wondered, a little sardonically, if the carrier expected to find Russian submarines so close to shore.</div>

<div class="line_en">The thought of Russia turned his mind, as it always did, to Konrad, and that morning in the cataclysmic spring of 1945. More than thirty years had passed, but the memory of those last days when the Reich was crumbling beneath the waves from the East and from the West had never faded.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一想到俄国，他就想起了康拉德，想起了1945年春天那场灾难性的早晨。三十多年过去了，但帝国在东、西的海浪中摇摇欲坠的最后几天的记忆从未褪去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He could still see Konrad's tired blue eyes, and the golden stubble on his chin, as they shook hands and parted in that ruined Prussian village, while the refugees streamed endlessly past. It was a parting that symbolized everything that had since happened to the world -- the cleavage between East and West.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他仍然能看到康拉德疲惫的蓝眼睛和下巴上的金色胡茬，他们在那座被毁坏的普鲁士村庄里握手告别，而难民们则源源不断地从这里经过。这是一次离别，象征着此后发生在世界上的东西方分裂。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For Konrad chose the road to Moscow. Reinhold had thought him a fool, but now he was not so sure.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因为康拉德选择了去莫斯科。莱因霍尔德曾认为他是个傻瓜，但现在他不太确定了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For thirty years he had assumed that Konrad was dead. It was only a week ago that Colonel Sandmeyer, of Technical Intelligence, had given him the news. He didn't like Sandmeyer, and he was sure the feeling was mutual. But neither let that interfere with business.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="三十年来，他一直以为康拉德已经死了。就在一周前，技术情报部的桑德梅尔上校才告诉他这个消息。他不喜欢桑德梅耶，他确信这种感觉是相互的。但也不能让这影响工作。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Mr. Hoffmann," the Colonel had begun, in his best official manner, "I've just had some alarming information from Washington. It's top secret, of course, but we've decided to break it to the engineering staff so that they'll realize the necessity for speed." He paused for effect, but the gesture was wasted on Reinhold. Somehow, he already knew what was coming.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“霍夫曼先生，”上校以他最正式的态度开始说，“我刚从华盛顿得到一些令人震惊的消息。当然，这是最高机密，但我们决定把它告诉工程人员，让他们认识到速度的必要性。”他停了下来，想达到效果，但这个手势在莱因霍尔德身上浪费了。不知怎么的，他已经知道了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The Russians are nearly level with us. They've got some kind of atomic drive -- it may even be more efficient than ours, and they're building a ship on the shores of Lake Baikal. We don't know how far they've got, but Intelligence believe it may be launched this year. You know what that means."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“俄国人几乎和我们持平。他们有某种原子动力，甚至可能比我们的效率更高，他们正在贝加尔湖岸边建造一艘飞船。我们不知道他们建造多久了，但情报部门相信它可能会在今年发射。你知道那意味着什么！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Do you know who's running their team?" he had asked, not really expecting an answer. To his surprise, Colonel Sandmeyer had pushed across a typewritten sheet and there at its head was the name: Konrad Schneider.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你知道谁在管理他们的团队吗？”他问过，其实并不期待得到答复。令他吃惊的是，桑德梅尔上校推开一张打印纸，上面写着：康拉德·施耐德。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You knew a lot of these men at Peenemьnde, didn't you?" said the Colonel. "That may give us some insight into their methods. I'd like you to let me have notes on as many of them as you can -- their specialties, the bright ideas they had, and so on. I know it's asking a lot after all this time -- but see what you can do."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你在佩内姆认识很多这样的人，不是吗？”上校说这也许能让我们对他们的方法有所了解。我希望你能让我尽可能多地记下他们的特长，他们的聪明想法，等等。我知道经过这么长时间，我知道这要求很高，但看看你能做些什么。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Konrad Schneider is the only one who matters," Reinhold had answered. "He was brilliant -- the others are just competent engineers. Heaven only knows what he's done in thirty years. Remember -- he's probably seen all our results and we haven't seen any of his. That gives him a decided advantage."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“康拉德·施耐德是唯一重要的人，”莱因霍尔德回答说他很聪明，其他人都是称职的工程师。天知道他三十年来做了什么。记住，他可能看过我们所有的结果，而我们没有看到他的任何结果。这给了他一个决定性的优势。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他并不是说这是对智力的批评，但有一刻桑德梅尔似乎要被冒犯了。上校耸了耸肩。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It works both ways -- you've told me that yourself. Our free exchange of information means swifter progress, even if we do give away a few secrets. The Russian research departments probably don't know what their own people are doing half the time. We'll show them that Democracy can get to the moon first."</div>

<div class="line_en">The sun which had deserted Taratua was still high above Lake Baikal when Konrad Schneider and the Assistant Commissar for Nuclear Science walked slowly back from the motor test rig.

<div class="line_en">"You're an optimist, as usual," said Schneider. "Even though the motor works, it's not as easy as that. True, I can't see any serious obstacles now-but I'm worried about the reports from Taratua. I've told you how good Hoffmann is, and he's got billions of dollars behind him. Those photographs of his ship aren't very clear, but it looks as if it's not far from completion. And we know he tested his motor five weeks ago."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“像往常一样，你是个乐观主义者，”施耐德说即使马达能工作，也没那么容易。是的，我现在看不到任何严重的障碍，但我担心塔拉图的报道。我告诉过你霍夫曼有多好，他背后有几十亿美元。他的飞船的照片不是很清楚，但看起来离完工不远了。我们知道他五周前测试了他的马达。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The guard saluted as he re-entered the administration building. There were nearly as many soldiers here, he thought grimly, as technicians. But that was how the Russians did things, and as long as they kept out of his way he had no complaints. On the whole -- with exasperating exceptions-events had turned out very much as he had hoped. Only the future could tell if he or Reinhold had made the better choice.</div>

<div class="line_en">He was already at work on his final report when the sound of shouting voices disturbed him.

Then he walked to the window -- and for the first time in his life he knew despair.</div>

<div class="line_en">The stars were all around him as Reinhold descended the little hill. Out at sea, the "Forrestal" was still sweeping the water with her fingers of light, while further along the beach the scaffolding round the "Columbus" had transformed itself into an illuminated Christmas tree. Only the projecting prow of the ship lay like a dark shadow across the stars.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then Reinhold Hoffmann knew, as did Konrad Schneider at this same moment, that he had lost his race. And he knew that he had lost it, not by the few weeks or months that he had feared, but by millennia. The huge and silent shadows driving across the stars, more miles above his head than he dared to guess, were as far beyond his little "Columbus" as it surpassed the log canoes of paleolithic man. For a moment that seemed to last forever, Reinhold watched, as all the world was watching, while the great ships descended in their overwhelming majesty -- until at last he could hear the faint scream of their passage through the thin air of the stratosphere.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，莱因霍尔德·霍夫曼也跟康拉德·施耐德一样知道，他输了比赛。他知道他已经失去了它，不是在他害怕的几个星期或几个月，而是在几千年前。巨大而寂静的阴影划过星空，比他不敢想象的还要高出他的头，远远超出了他的小“哥伦布”，甚至超过了旧石器时代人类的独木舟。在那似乎永远持续的时刻，莱因霍尔德注视着，全世界都在注视着，当伟大的飞船只以压倒性的威严降落下来时，他终于听到了它们穿过平流层稀薄空气时发出的微弱的尖叫声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He felt no regrets as the work of a lifetime was swept away. He had laboured to take men to the stars, and in the moment of success the stars -- the aloof, indifferent stars -- had come to him. This was the moment when history held its breath, and the present sheared asunder from the past as an iceberg splits from its frozen parent cliffs and goes sailing out to sea in lonely pride. All that the past ages had achieved was as nothing now; only one thought echoed and re-echoed through Reinhold's brain; The human race was no longer alone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一生的工作一扫而空，他不感到遗憾。他努力把人们带到星球上去，在成功的那一刻，那些冷漠、冷漠的星星来到了他身边。这一刻，历史屏住了呼吸，现在与过去割裂开来，就像冰山从它冰冷的母体悬崖上裂开，带着孤独的骄傲驶向大海。过去的时代所取得的一切现在都是徒劳的；只有一种思想在莱因霍尔德的大脑里不断地回响；人类不再是孤独的。">查看中文翻译</div>
