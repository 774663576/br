<div class="line_en">I need to speak to your parents, dokhtar jan," he said when Laila opened the door. He was a stocky man, with a sharp, weather-roughened face. He wore a potato-colored coat, and a brown wool pakol on his head.</div>

<div class="line_en">As she moved toward the steps, Laila heard the visitor say to Babi that he had news from Panjshir. Mammy was in the room now too. She had one hand clamped over her mouth, and her eyes were skipping from Babi to the man in the pakol.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她爬上楼梯的时候，听到客人对爸爸说他有一条潘杰希尔传来的消息。这时妈妈也在客厅里面了。她一只手掩住嘴巴，眼睛来回看着爸爸和那个戴毡帽的男人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then Babi's hand was on Laila's shoulder, and he gently pulled her from the door.</div>

<div class="line_en">THE NEXT MORNING, the day of the fatiha, a flock of neighborhood women descended on the house and took charge of preparations for the khatm dinner that would take place after the funeral. Mammy sat on the couch the whole morning, her fingers working a handkerchief, her face bloated. She was tended to by a pair of sniffling women who took turns patting Mammy's hand gingerly, like she was the rarest and most fragile doll in the world. Mammy did not seem aware of their presence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天是出殡的日子，一群邻居的女人突然来到家里，承担起准备葬礼之后那顿晚餐的任务。妈妈整个早上一直坐在沙发上，手中抓着手帕，脸庞都哭肿了。两个不停抽鼻子的女人在照料她，她们轮流轻轻地拍拍妈妈的手，仿佛她是全世界最为珍稀、最为脆弱的洋娃娃。妈妈好像没有察觉到她们的存在。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Laila peeked from the top of the stairs. She watched the stranger sit down with her parents. He leaned toward them. Said a few muted words. Then Babi's face was white, and getting whiter, and he was looking at his hands, and Mammy was screaming, screaming, and tearing at her hair.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱拉从楼梯上方向下偷看。她见到那个陌生人和她父母一起坐下。他的身体倾向他们。说了几句莱拉听不见的话。然后爸爸脸色灰白，越来越白，死死盯着自己的双手，而妈妈则哭喊起来，不停地哭喊，拉扯着自己的头发。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"We'll take care of her, Laila jan," one of the women said with an air of self-importance. Laila had been to funerals before where she had seen women like this, women who relished all things that had to do with death, official consolers who let no one trespass on their self-appointed duties.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们会照顾她的，亲爱的莱拉。”这两个女人中，有一个以自负的口气说。莱拉曾在她去过的几个葬礼上见识到这样的女人，这些女人喜欢应付一切跟死亡有关的事情，她们的爱好就是劝慰死者的亲属，决不会让人侵犯她们这点自我指派的职责。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's under control. You go on now, girl, and do something else. Leave your mother be."</div>

<div class="line_en">Shooed away, Laila felt useless. She bounced from one room to the next. She puttered around the kitchen for a while. An uncharacteristically subdued Hasina and her mother came. So did Giti and her mother. When Giti saw Laila, she hurried over, threw her bony arms around her, and gave Laila a very long, and surprisingly strong, embrace. When she pulled back, tears had pooled in her eyes. "I am so sorry, Laila," she said. Laila thanked her. The three girls sat outside in the yard until one of the women assigned them the task of washing glasses and stacking plates on the table.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="被支开的莱拉觉得自己毫无用处。她从一个房间走进另一个房间。她在厨房瞎混了一阵子。哈西娜乖乖地跟着她的母亲来了。吉提和她母亲也来了。看到莱拉的时候，吉提匆匆跑过来，用她那双骨瘦如柴的手抱住她，久久地抱着，莱拉没想到她能够抱得这么紧。当她松开手时，眼里充满了盈盈欲滴的泪水。“我很难过，莱拉。”她说。莱拉感谢她。这三个女孩走出屋外，坐在院子里，直到有个女人安排她们去洗玻璃杯，还有把餐盘叠在桌子上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Babi ended up sitting alone on a folding chair in the hallway, looking desolate and small. Then one of the women told him he was in the way there. He apologized and disappeared into his study.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爸爸最后独自坐在走廊的一张折叠椅上，看上去凄凉而渺小。然后有个女人说他挡到路了。他连忙道歉，回到他的书房去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Babi too kept walking in and out of the house aimlessly, looking, it seemed, for something to do.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Keep him away from me." That was the only time Mammy said anything all morning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“别让他靠近我。”一整个早上，妈妈就说了这句话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">From a cassette player, a man's nasal voice chanted verses from the Koran. In between, the women sighed and shifted and sniffled. There were muted coughs, murmurs, and, periodically, someone let out a theatrical, sorrow-drenched sob.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="录音机传出一个鼻音很重的男人朗诵《古兰经》经文的声音。每当他念完一段经文，那些女人有的叹气，有的挪动身体，有的啜泣。也有人捂着嘴巴咳嗽，窃窃私语，时不时还有人发出一声戏剧性的、一点也不悲哀的号哭。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">THAT AFTERNOON, the men went to a hall in Karteh-Seh that Babi had rented for the fatiha. The women came to the house. Laila took her spot beside Mammy, next to the living-room entrance where it was customary for the family of the deceased to sit. Mourners removed their shoes at the door, nodded at acquaintances as they crossed the room, and sat on folding chairs arranged along the walls. Laila saw Wajma, the elderly midwife who had delivered her. She saw Tariq's mother too, wearing a black scarf over the wig. She gave Laila a nod and a slow, sad, close-lipped smile.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天下午，男人们都到爸爸在卡德察区租来办出殡仪式的礼堂去了。女人们则到莱拉家里来。根据传统，死者的家属应该坐在客厅门口，莱拉和妈妈坐在那个地方。前来致哀的人在门口脱了鞋，一边走进客厅，一边和熟人点头打招呼，在沿墙边摆放的折叠椅上坐下。莱拉看到瓦吉玛，那个在她出世时给妈妈接生的老婆婆。她还看见塔里克的母亲，在假发上披了一条黑色的围巾。她朝莱拉点点头，嘴唇紧闭，慢慢地露出悲伤的微笑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Now and then, sitting next to Mammy, seeing the drooping, woebegone looks around the room, the magnitude of the disaster that had struck her family would register with Laila. The possibilities denied. The hopes dashed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱拉坐在妈妈身边，不停地看看周围，又把眼光垂下，满屋子都是哀伤的表情，莱拉总算明白她家里遭遇的这场灾难有多么深重。各种可能性消失了。各种希望破灭了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Laila drew Mammy's hand into her lap and cradled it with both of hers, but Mammy did not seem to notice.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Do you want some water, Mammy?" Laila said in her ear. "Are you thirsty?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你想喝点水吗，妈妈？”莱拉在她耳边说，“你渴吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Rasheed's wife, Mariam, came in. She was wearing a black hijab. Strands of her hair strayed from it onto her brow. She took a seat along the wall across from Laila.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拉希德的妻子玛丽雅姆走了进来。她戴着黑色的头巾。额头上有几绺头发从头巾之下垂下来。她在莱拉对面的墙边找了个位子坐下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But the feeling didn't last. It was hard to feel, really feel, Mammy's loss. Hard to summon sorrow, to grieve the deaths of people Laila had never really thought of as alive in the first place. Ahmad and Noor had always been like lore to her. Like characters in a fable. Kings in a history book.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是这种感觉没有持续很久。莱拉很难感受，很难真的感受到妈妈的痛苦。莱拉从来就不认为他们活着，所以也很难因为他们的去世而感到悲伤和哀悼。对她来说，艾哈迈德和努尔一直以来就像是传说。就像是寓言故事中的人物。历史书中的国王。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But Mammy said nothing. She did nothing but sway back and forth and stare at the rug with a remote, spiritless look.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但妈妈什么都没说。她只顾来回摇晃着身体，冷漠无神的双眼盯着地毯看。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was Tariq who was real, flesh and blood. Tariq, who taught her cusswords in Pashto, who liked salted clover leaves, who frowned and made a low, moaning sound when he chewed, who had a light pink birthmark just beneath his left collarbone shaped like an upside-down mandolin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="塔里克才是真实的，有血有肉的。塔里克教她用普什图话骂人；他喜欢吃盐渍的苜蓿叶；他吃东西的时候会皱眉，慢慢地发出呻吟声；他左边的锁骨下方有一块淡红色的胎记，形状像一把倒放的曼陀林[1]。【注：[1]一种类似琵琶的乐器。】">查看中文翻译</div>
