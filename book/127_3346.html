<div class="line_en">"I don't know anyone in the world who could have done it," she said; "but there has been someone. And here we are sitting by their fire -- and -- and -- it's true! And whoever it is -- wherever they are -- I have a friend, Becky -- someone is my friend."</div>

<div class="line_en">Imagine, if you can, what the rest of the evening was like. How they crouched by the fire which blazed and leaped and made so much of itself in the little grate. How they removed the covers of the dishes, and found rich, hot, savory soup, which was a meal in itself, and sandwiches and toast and muffins enough for both of them. The mug from the washstand was used as Becky's tea cup, and the tea was so delicious that it was not necessary to pretend that it was anything but tea. They were warm and full-fed and happy, and it was just like Sara that, having found her strange good fortune real, she should give herself up to the enjoyment of it to the utmost. She had lived such a life of imaginings that she was quite equal to accepting any wonderful thing that happened, and almost to cease, in a short time, to find it bewildering.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果你能想象，请想象那天晚上的其余时间是怎样度过的吧。她们是如何蹲在炉火旁，那小壁炉里火焰闪烁跳跃，大大地发挥自己的作用，又是如何揭去碟盖，发现味浓可口的热汤，仅此就够当一顿饭了，还有足够两人吃的三明治、烤面包片和小松饼。脸盆架上的大漱口杯给贝基当茶杯，那茶多好喝呀，没有必要假装它不是茶而是别的什么东西。她们又暖和又吃得饱饱的，真是开心，既已发现她这神妙的好运是真实的，就应该一心一意地尽情享受它，这样才合乎萨拉的本性呢。她一直生活在幻想中，所以完全能接受已发生的任何惊人的好事，并且过了一会儿，就简直不再觉得惶恐不安了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No, it won't melt away," said Sara. "I am EATING this muffin, and I can taste it. You never really eat things in dreams. You only think you are going to eat them. Besides, I keep giving myself pinches; and I touched a hot piece of coal just now, on purpose."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，它不会消失掉，”萨拉说。“我正在吃这块松饼，而且能尝出它的味道来。若在梦中，你不会真正地吃东西。你仅仅是自以为就要吃它们。况且我还不时掐自己，刚才我还有意摸过一块热煤。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Do you think," Becky faltered once, in a whisper, "do you think it could melt away, miss? Hadn't we better be quick?" And she hastily crammed her sandwich into her mouth. If it was only a dream, kitchen manners would be overlooked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你是不是认为，”贝基结巴了一下悄悄说——“你是不是认为这一切会消失掉，小姐？我们是不是最好吃得快一点？”于是她匆忙把三明治塞进嘴巴。如果这仅仅是场梦，那么原来那套厨房礼仪就不必讲究了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The sleepy comfort which at length almost overpowered them was a heavenly thing. It was the drowsiness of happy, well-fed childhood, and they sat in the fire glow and luxuriated in it until Sara found herself turning to look at her transformed bed.</div>

<div class="line_en">"If it ain't here in the mornin', miss," she said, "it's been here tonight, anyways, an' I shan't never forget it." She looked at each particular thing, as if to commit it to memory. "The fire was THERE, pointing with her finger, "an' the table was before it; an' the lamp was there, an' the light looked rosy red; an' there was a satin cover on your bed, an' a warm rug on the floor, an' everythin' looked beautiful; an'"-- she paused a second, and laid her hand on her stomach tenderly --"there WAS soup an' sandwiches an' muffins -- there WAS." And, with this conviction a reality at least, she went away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“如果明天早晨它们全都不在这儿了，小姐，”她说，“可是反正今晚它们都在，我就永远也忘不了它们。”她把每件东西都看了一下，似乎要把它们全都印在记忆中。“炉火就在那儿，”她用手指着说，“桌子在它的前面，灯在那儿，灯光看上去是玫瑰红的，你床上有缎子床罩，地板上有一条温暖的小地毯，样样东西都看起来是美丽的，而且”——她歇了一口气，把手轻轻地放在肚子上——“这儿有肉菜汤、三明治和松饼——这儿有的是。”于是至少带着对现实的这种想法，她走了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Through the mysterious agency which works in schools and among servants, it was quite well known in the morning that Sara Crewe was in horrible disgrace, that Ermengarde was under punishment, and that Becky would have been packed out of the house before breakfast, but that a scullery maid could not be dispensed with at once. The servants knew that she was allowed to stay because Miss Minchin could not easily find another creature helpless and humble enough to work like a bounden slave for so few shillings a week. The elder girls in the schoolroom knew that if Miss Minchin did not send Sara away it was for practical reasons of her own.</div>

<div class="line_en">Miss Minchin had expected to see in Sara, when she appeared in the schoolroom, very much what Lavinia had expected to see. Sara had always been an annoying puzzle to her, because severity never made her cry or look frightened. When she was scolded she stood still and listened politely with a grave face; when she was punished she performed her extra tasks or went without her meals, making no complaint or outward sign of rebellion. The very fact that she never made an impudent answer seemed to Miss Minchin a kind of impudence in itself. But after yesterday's deprivation of meals, the violent scene of last night, the prospect of hunger today, she must surely have broken down. It would be strange indeed if she did not come downstairs with pale cheeks and red eyes and an unhappy, humbled face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="铭钦女士本想看看萨拉今天在教室出现时到底会是什么样子，这正是拉维尼娅很想看到的。对铭钦女士来说，萨拉一直是个恼人的难题，因为用严厉的态度从来无法使她哭泣或面露惧色。她挨骂时，总是默立恭听，脸色庄重；她受惩罚时，就干额外的活儿，不吃饭就走开，没有抱怨，也不流露出要反抗的形迹。她从来没有唐突无礼的答话，这一事实在铭钦女士看来似乎本身就是一种唐突无礼的行为。但经历了昨天一天不准吃饭和昨晚的那个暴虐场面，想想今天还得挨饿，她肯定已被压垮了。如果她今天下楼来不是两颊苍白、两眼通红、脸色不快而恭顺，那才奇怪呢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Miss Minchin saw her for the first time when she entered the schoolroom to hear the little French class recite its lessons and superintend its exercises. And she came in with a springing step, color in her cheeks, and a smile hovering about the corners of her mouth. It was the most astonishing thing Miss Minchin had ever known. It gave her quite a shock. What was the child made of? What could such a thing mean? She called her at once to her desk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="今天铭钦女士第一次看到萨拉是当萨拉进教室来听那小班读法语课文并监督她们做练习的时候。但她进门时却是用着有弹性的步伐，两颊红润，嘴角漾着一抹微笑。这可是铭钦女士所碰到的最惊奇的事了。这使她相当震惊。这孩子是由什么做成的？这样的怪事意味着什么呢？她立即把萨拉叫到书桌前来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, laws! Oh, laws!" Becky uttered the exclamation in a sort of rapturous groan, and ducked her head over her kettle just in time, as the cook came in from the kitchen.</div>

<div class="line_en">The truth is that when one is still a child -- or even if one is grown up -- and has been well fed, and has slept long and softly and warm; when one has gone to sleep in the midst of a fairy story, and has wakened to find it real, one cannot be unhappy or even look as if one were; and one could not, if one tried, keep a glow of joy out of one's eyes.

<div class="line_cn" title="实际情况是，当你仍是个孩子——或者甚至已长大成人了——吃得饱，睡得足，加上床上又柔软又暖和，当你在听一只神话故事时睡去，醒来后发现它竟是真实的，你就不可能感到不幸福或者显出那副样子，即使你努力隐藏也隐藏不住眼睛里的快乐的光芒。当萨拉抬起眼睛，十足恭敬地答话时，铭钦女士几乎被她的眼神震惊得哑口无言。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One thing Sara had resolved upon, as she thought things over. The wonders which had happened must be kept a secret, if such a thing were possible. If Miss Minchin should choose to mount to the attic again, of course all would be discovered. But it did not seem likely that she would do so for some time at least, unless she was led by suspicion. Ermengarde and Lottie would be watched with such strictness that they would not dare to steal out of their beds again. Ermengarde could be told the story and trusted to keep it secret. If Lottie made any discoveries, she could be bound to secrecy also. Perhaps the Magic itself would help to hide its own marvels.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="萨拉把事情反复想了一番，下决心要做到一件事。如果可能的话，必须把那已发生的奇迹保守秘密。如果铭钦女士竟想再上阁楼来，那当然全会被她发现。但至少在一段时间内她似乎不大可能这样做，除非她被怀疑所驱使。埃芒加德和洛蒂会被严格监视，她们也就不敢再偷偷从床上溜走了。可以把这事告诉埃芒加德，相信她能保密。如果洛蒂发现了什么，也能让她务必保密。也许魔法本身能帮助隐藏它自己制造的奇迹。">查看中文翻译</div>

She was probably determined to brave the matter out.</div>

<div class="line_en">If it was possible for weather to be worse than it had been the day before, it was worse this day -- wetter, muddier, colder. There were more errands to be done, the cook was more irritable, and, knowing that Sara was in disgrace, she was more savage. But what does anything matter when one's Magic has just proved itself one's friend. Sara's supper of the night before had given her strength, she knew that she should sleep well and warmly, and, even though she had naturally begun to be hungry again before evening, she felt that she could bear it until breakfast-time on the following day, when her meals would surely be given to her again. It was quite late when she was at last allowed to go upstairs. She had been told to go into the schoolroom and study until ten o'clock, and she had become interested in her work, and remained over her books later.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Magic had been there again. It actually had, and it had done even more than before. The fire was blazing, in lovely leaping flames, more merrily than ever. A number of new things had been brought into the attic which so altered the look of it that if she had not been past doubting she would have rubbed her eyes. Upon the low table another supper stood -- this time with cups and plates for Becky as well as herself; a piece of bright, heavy, strange embroidery covered the battered mantel, and on it some ornaments had been placed. All the bare, ugly things which could be covered with draperies had been concealed and made to look quite pretty. Some odd materials of rich colors had been fastened against the wall with fine, sharp tacks -- so sharp that they could be pressed into the wood and plaster without hammering. Some brilliant fans were pinned up, and there were several large cushions, big and substantial enough to use as seats. A wooden box was covered with a rug, and some cushions lay on it, so that it wore quite the air of a sofa.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="魔法又在那儿出现了。它居然再次出现，甚至比上一次做得更多。炉火熊熊燃烧着，可爱的火焰比以前蹦跳得更欢。许多新东西被拿进了阁楼，一改阁楼的旧貌，若不是她已不再置疑，是会擦擦眼睛看个究竟的。矮桌上又摆好了一顿晚餐——这一次的杯盘是供贝基和萨拉两人使用的，一块既厚实又新奇鲜艳的绣花布盖住了破旧的壁炉台，上面还摆设了些装饰品。所有光秃秃的难看东西，凡是可以用帷慢遮盖的，都掩蔽得使之看上去十分漂亮。有些色彩鲜艳的新奇材料已用尖锐的小图钉固定在墙上——小图钉尖锐得不用锤子敲就可以按进木头或墙壁。一些光彩夺目的扇形饰物被钉上了，还有几个大垫子，大而厚实得足以当坐垫用。还有只木箱，上面铺着块小地毯，还放上了一些垫子，这一来颇有沙发的派头了。">查看中文翻译</div>

Some new comfort or ornament appeared each time Sara opened the door at night, until in a short time the attic was a beautiful little room full of all sorts of odd and luxurious things. The ugly walls were gradually entirely covered with pictures and draperies, ingenious pieces of folding furniture appeared, a bookshelf was hung up and filled with books, new comforts and conveniences appeared one by one, until there seemed nothing left to be desired. When Sara went downstairs in the morning, the remains of the supper were on the table; and when she returned to the attic in the evening, the magician had removed them and left another nice little meal. Miss Minchin was as harsh and insulting as ever, Miss Amelia as peevish, and the servants were as vulgar and rude. Sara was sent on errands in all weathers, and scolded and driven hither and thither; she was scarcely allowed to speak to Ermengarde and Lottie; Lavinia sneered at the increasing shabbiness of her clothes; and the other girls stared curiously at her when she appeared in the schoolroom. But what did it all matter while she was living in this wonderful mysterious story? It was more romantic and delightful than anything she had ever invented to comfort her starved young soul and save herself from despair. Sometimes, when she was scolded, she could scarcely keep from smiling.</div>

Relations were sometimes very odd -- particularly rich old bachelor uncles, who did not care for having children near them. A man of that sort might prefer to overlook his young relation's welfare at a distance. Such a person, however, would be sure to be crotchety and hot-tempered enough to be easily offended. It would not be very pleasant if there were such a one, and he should learn all the truth about the thin, shabby clothes, the scant food, and the hard work.

<div class="line_en">"I can write to him," she said joyfully, "and leave it on the table. Then perhaps the person who takes the things away will take it, too. I won't ask him anything. He won't mind my thanking him, I feel sure."</div>

<div class="line_en">I hope you will not think it is impolite that I should write this note to you when you wish to keep yourself a secret. Please believe I do not mean to be impolite or try to find out anything at all; only I want to thank you for being so kind to me -- so heavenly kind -- and making everything like a fairy story. I am so grateful to you, and I am so happy -- and so is Becky. Becky feels just as thankful as I do -- it is all just as beautiful and wonderful to her as it is to me. We used to be so lonely and cold and hungry, and now -- oh, just think what you have done for us! Please let me say just these words. It seems as if I OUGHT to say them. THANK you -- THANK you -- THANK you!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="希望你不致认为这是不礼貌之举：在你存心隐姓埋名地保守秘密之际，我居然写这个便条给你。请相信我不是有意无礼，或是最终想发现什么，我只想感谢你待我如此仁慈——超凡地仁慈——使一切变得都像神话故事中一样。我多么感激你，我又是多么幸福——而贝基也是如此。她也像我一样地感激你——对她来说，一切都和对我一样美好。我们曾经是那么的孤独，寒冷和饥饿，现在——哦，想想你为我们做了什么！请让我说这些话。似乎我应该说出来。谢谢——谢谢——谢谢！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She stopped short because her eyes at that instant fell upon something standing on a table in a corner. It was something she had found in the room when she came up to it only two days before. It was a little writing-case fitted with paper and envelopes and pens and ink.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她突然打住了，因为此时她的目光落在墙角一张桌上搁着的什么东西上。那是才不过两天前她进阁楼时发现的小文具盒，里面装着纸张、信封、钢笔和墨水。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The next morning she left this on the little table, and in the evening it had been taken away with the other things; so she knew the Magician had received it, and she was happier for the thought. She was reading one of her new books to Becky just before they went to their respective beds, when her attention was attracted by a sound at the skylight. When she looked up from her page she saw that Becky had heard the sound also, as she had turned her head to look and was listening rather nervously.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天早晨，她把这个放在小桌子上，到了晚上，它和别的东西一起被拿走了，所以她知道魔术师已经收到了它，她为这个想法感到高兴。就在贝基上床睡觉前，她正在给她读一本新书，这时天窗的声音吸引了她的注意力。当她从书页上抬起头来时，她看到贝基也听到了那声音，因为她转过头去看，正在紧张地听着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She left her chair and went to the skylight. It was a queer little sound she heard -- like a soft scratching. She suddenly remembered something and laughed.

She had seen him that very afternoon, sitting disconsolately on a table before a window in the Indian gentleman's house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她离开椅子，走向天窗。她听到的是一个奇怪的小声音——像是轻轻的抓挠声。她突然想起什么，笑了起来。她想起一个古怪的小闯入者，他以前曾进过阁楼。那天下午，她看见他闷闷不乐地坐在印度绅士家窗户前的一张桌子上。">查看中文翻译</div>
