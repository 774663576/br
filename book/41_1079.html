<div class="line_en">I should say that I intend this letter not just for you, Mr. Markos, but for another as well, to whom I hope you will pass it on, as I shall explain later. Forgive me, then, if I repeat a few things you may already know. I include them out of necessity, for her benefit. As you will see, this letter contains more than an element of confession, Mr. Markos, but there are also pragmatic matters that prompt this writing. For those, I fear I will call upon your assistance, my friend.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the Name of Allah the Most Beneficent, the Most Merciful, I know that I will be gone when you read this letter, Mr. Markos, for when I gave it to you I requested that you not open it until after my death. Let me state now what a pleasure it has been to know you over the last seven years, Mr. Markos. As I write this, I think fondly of our yearly ritual of planting tomatoes in the garden, your morning visits to my small quarters for tea and pleasantry, our impromptu trading of Farsi and English lessons. I thank you for your friendship, your thoughtfulness, and for the work that you have undertaken in this country, and I trust that you will extend my gratitude to your kindhearted colleagues as well, especially to my friend Ms. Amra Ademovic, who has such capacity for compassion, and to her brave and lovely daughter, Roshi.</div>

<div class="line_en">I have thought long on where to begin this story. No easy task, this, for a man who must be in his mid-eighties. My exact age is a mystery to me, as it is to many Afghans of my generation, but I am confident in my approximation because I recall quite vividly a fist-fight with my friend, and later to be brother-in-law, Saboor, on the day we heard that Nāder Shah had been shot and killed, and that Nāder Shah's son, young Zahir, had ascended to the throne. That was 1933. I could begin there, I suppose. Or somewhere else. A story is like a moving train: no matter where you hop onboard, you are bound to reach your destination sooner or later. But I suppose I ought to begin this tale with the same thing that ends it. Yes, I think it stands to reason that I bookend this account with Nila Wahdati.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我想了很久，不知道这故事该从何说起。这对一个肯定已有八十五六的老头子来说，实非易事。就像我这一辈的很多阿富汗人一样，我到底多大年纪了，连我自己也不清楚。可要是说个大概的岁数，那我心里还是蛮有谱的，因为我非常清楚地记得和萨布尔打过的那一架。他是我的朋友，后来成了我妹夫。打架的那天，我们听说有人朝纳第尔沙开了枪，把他杀了，纳第尔沙的儿子，年轻的查希尔，已经登基做了国王。那是1933年的事。我蛮可以从那个时候讲起，不过还是换个别的开头吧。故事就像行进中的火车：不管你在哪儿跳上去，都能到达目的地，早一些晚一些而已。但是我觉得，这个故事在哪儿结束，也就该从哪儿开始。是的，我认为这样才合情合理，那就从妮拉·瓦赫达提开始吧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I met her in 1949, the year she married Mr. Wahdati. At the time, I had already been working for Mr. Suleiman Wahdati for two years, having moved to Kabul from Shadbagh, the village where I was born, back in 1946-- I had worked for a year in another household in the same neighborhood. The circumstances of my departure from Shadbagh are not something I am proud of, Mr. Markos. Consider it the first of my confessions, then, when I say that I felt stifled by the life I had in the village with my sisters, one of whom was an invalid. Not that it absolves me, but I was a young man, Mr. Markos, eager to take on the world, full of dreams, modest and vague as they may have been, and I pictured my youth ebbing away, my prospects increasingly truncated. So I left. To help provide for my sisters, yes, that is true. But also to escape.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我是1949年遇见她的，那一年她嫁给了瓦赫达提先生。当时我已经为苏莱曼·瓦赫达提先生工作了两年，之前我在同一片住宅区，在另一户人家干过一年。我1946年来了喀布尔，老家在沙德巴格，我就生在那村子。马科斯先生，我离开沙德巴格的前因后果，可不是什么引以为荣的事。请把这当做我的第一个忏悔吧，因为我要说的是，当时我感觉村子里的生活扼杀了我。我和两个妹妹一起过，有一个还是残疾。我无意为自己脱罪，马科斯先生，可我当时是个大小伙子，渴望着闯荡世界，满脑子的梦想，很简单，也很模糊，我的梦想历来如此，可是，眼看着青春慢慢消逝，未来的路越来越窄，我就离开了，去找事做养活两个妹妹。是的，这是实话，可那也是我的逃亡。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Since I was a full-time worker for Mr. Wahdati, I lived at his residence full-time as well. In those days, the house bore little resemblance to the lamentable state in which you found it when you arrived in Kabul in 2002, Mr. Markos. It was a beautiful, glorious place. The house shone sparkling white in those days, as if sheathed with diamonds. The front gates opened onto a wide asphalt driveway. One entered into a high-ceilinged foyer decorated with tall ceramic vases and a circular mirror framed in carved walnut, precisely the spot where you for a while hung the old homemade-camera photo of your childhood friend at the beach. The marble floor of the living room glistened and was partly covered by a dark red Turkoman carpet. The carpet is gone now, as are the leather sofas, the handcrafted coffee table, the lapis chess set, the tall mahogany cabinet. Little of the grand furniture has survived, and I am afraid it is not in the shape it once was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我为瓦赫达提先生全职工作，所以也全天住在他家里。当时这房子，马科斯先生，可一点都不像您2002年刚到喀布尔时看到的那样破败。它是个漂亮的、宏伟的宅邸。那个时候，这房子洁白耀眼，好像周身镶嵌着钻石。正门外是一条宽宽的柏油车道，一进来就是屋顶高高的门厅，摆放着高大的陶瓷花瓶，一面胡桃木镜框的圆镜子，正好位于有段时间您挂照片的地方，就是您童年时代朋友的照片，用自制老相机在海滩上拍的那张。客厅的大理石地板亮闪闪的，有一部分铺上了深红色的土库曼地毯。地毯现在已经没了，皮沙发、手工茶几、青金石的棋具、高高的红木柜子也都没了。那些豪华的家具几乎什么都没剩下，现在它们恐怕也不是原来的模样了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The first time I entered the stone-tiled kitchen, my mouth fell wide open. I thought it had been built large enough to feed all of my home village of Shadbagh. I had a six-burner stove, a refrigerator, a toaster, and an abundance of pots, pans, knives, and appliances at my disposal. The bathrooms, all four of them, had intricately carved marble tiles and porcelain sinks. And those square holes in your bathroom counter upstairs, Mr. Markos? They were once filled with lapis.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我头一次走进那贴着石头墙砖的厨房时，嘴巴都合不拢。我想，厨房盖这么大，让我老家沙德巴格的全体村民来这儿吃饭都成。六灶的炉子，一个冰箱，一个烤箱，好多好多的罐子、锅、刀，还有各种各样的厨具供我使用。卫生间总共有四个，贴着精雕细刻的大理石墙砖，装着陶瓷的洗手池。马科斯先生，楼上您卫生间的台子上，有四个方洞对吗？里面本来镶的是青金石。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then there was the backyard. You must one day sit in your office upstairs, Mr. Markos, look down on the garden, and try to picture it as it was. One entered it through a semilunar veranda bordered by a railing sheathed with green vines. The lawn in those days was lush and green, dotted with beds of flowers -- jasmine, sweetbriar, geraniums, tulips -- and bordered by two rows of fruit trees. A man could lie beneath one of the cherry trees, Mr. Markos, close his eyes and listen to the breeze squeezing through the leaves and think that there wasn't on earth a finer place to live.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接下来要说说后园。马科斯先生，您一定得找一天，坐在您楼上的办公室里，往下看看花园，努力想像一下它原先的模样。过去要进花园，得经过一个半月形的游廊，栏杆上爬着绿色的葡萄藤。草坪厚实，翠绿，处处花团锦簇，有茉莉花、野玫瑰、天竺葵和郁金香，草坪的边上是两排果树。马科斯先生，人要是躺在樱桃树下，闭上眼睛，听着微风从树叶之间侧身而过，一定会认为，世界上再也没有比这更好的住处了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My own living space was a shack in the back of the yard. It had a window, clean walls with white paint, and provided enough space to accommodate an unmarried young man his meager needs. I had a bed, a desk and a chair, and enough room to unroll my prayer rug five times a day. It suited me just fine then and it suits me fine now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我自己住的，是后园最里面的一间窝棚。它有一扇窗户，四面白墙，粉刷得干干净净，对一个没有太多需要的未婚男青年来说，屋里的空间已经足够大了。我有一张床，一张桌子，一把椅子，还有足够的地方，让我一天五次铺开礼拜毯。小屋当年对我来说刚刚好，现在我也觉得挺合适。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I cooked for Mr. Wahdati, a skill I had picked up first from observing my late mother and later from an elderly Uzbek cook who worked at a household in Kabul where I had served for a year as his help. I was also, and quite happily, Mr. Wahdati's chauffeur. He owned a mid-1940s model Chevrolet, blue with a tan top, matching blue vinyl seats, and chrome wheels, a handsome car that drew lingering looks wherever we went. He allowed me to drive because I had proven myself to be a prudent and skilled driver, and, besides, he was the rare breed of man who did not enjoy the act of operating a car.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我给瓦赫达提先生做饭。之所以学会这门手艺，最早是看我已故的母亲下厨，后来在喀布尔的一户人家，有个上了年纪的乌兹别克厨子，我给他打过一年的下手。我也非常高兴地做了瓦赫达提先生的司机。他有一辆雪佛兰，四十年代中期的款式，车是蓝色的，带皮篷，同样蓝色的树脂座椅，镀铬的轮毂，非常漂亮的小汽车，不管我们去哪儿，都能让人驻足围观。他让我开车，因为他看出我是个好司机，谨慎，熟练，还因为他是那种不多见的男人，不喜欢摆弄汽车。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Please do not think I am boasting, Mr. Markos, when I say I was a good servant. Through careful observation, I had familiarized myself with Mr. Wahdati's likes and dislikes, his quirks, his peeves. I had come to know his habits and rituals well. For instance, every morning after breakfast he liked to go for a stroll. He disliked walking alone, however, and thus I was expected to accompany him. I abided by this wish, of course, though I did not see the point of my presence. He hardly said a word to me in the course of these walks and seemed forever lost in his own thoughts. He walked briskly, hands clamped behind his back, nodding at passersby, the heels of his well-polished leather loafers clicking against the pavement. And because his long legs made strides I could not match, I was always falling behind and forced to catch up. The rest of the day, he mostly retreated to his study upstairs, reading or playing a game of chess against himself. He loved to draw -- though I could not attest to his skills, at least not then, because he never shared his artwork with me -- and I would often catch him up in the study, by the window, or on the veranda, his brow furrowed in concentration, his charcoal pencil looping and circling over the sketch pad.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我是个好仆人。马科斯先生，请不要认为我在自夸。通过细心的观察，我对瓦赫达提先生的好恶，有什么怪癖，有哪些脾气，已经了如指掌。我也弄清楚了他有哪些习惯，有怎样的规范。比如，每天早晨吃过早餐，他都喜欢出门散散步。可他不喜欢一个人散步，所以就希望我陪着他。我只能从命，尽管我不明白自己有啥用。散步的时候，他几乎一句话都不和我说，好像永远在想自己的事。他走起来很快，背着手，对路人点头致意，一双乐福鞋，皮子擦得锃亮，鞋跟在人行道上咔咔作响。他两条大长腿，步子也大，我跟不上，老是掉在后面，只好不停地往前赶。一天当中其余的时间，他大部分都待在楼上的书房里，读书，跟自己下象棋。他喜欢画画，画得有多好我说不上来，至少那会儿还不清楚，因为他从来不让我看他的画。我经常能看到他，不是待在书房的窗口，就是在游廊里，皱着眉头，聚精会神，拿炭笔在速写本上又涂又抹。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I drove him around the city every few days. He went to see his mother once a week. There were also family gatherings. And though Mr. Wahdati avoided most of them, he did attend on occasion, and so I would drive him there, to funerals, birthday parties, weddings. I drove him monthly to an art supply store, where he restocked his pastel pencils, his charcoal, and his erasers and sharpeners and sketchbooks. Sometimes, he liked to sit in the backseat and just go for a drive. I would say, Where to, Sahib? and he would shrug, and I would say, Very well, Sahib, and I would shift into gear and off we would go. I would drive us around the city, for hours, without aim or purpose, from one neighborhood to another, alongside the Kabul River, up to Bala Hissar, sometimes out to the Darulaman Palace. Some days, I drove us out of Kabul and up to Ghargha Lake, where I would park near the banks of the water. I would turn off the engine, and Mr. Wahdati would sit perfectly still in the backseat, not saying a word to me, seemingly content enough to just roll down the window and look at the birds darting from tree to tree, and the streaks of sunlight that struck the lake and scattered into a thousand tiny bobbing specks on the water. I would gaze at him in the rearview mirror and he looked to me like the most lonesome person on earth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每隔几天，我就开车拉上他，到城里转一转。他去看他母亲，一个礼拜一次。还有家族聚会，不过大部分聚会瓦赫达提先生都推掉了，只是偶尔出席，所以我载着他去那儿，去葬礼、婚礼、生日派对。每个月，我拉他去一次美术用品商店，他到那儿备足蜡笔、炭笔、橡皮、铅笔刀和写生簿。有时他坐到后座上，只想出去兜个风。我问他：去哪儿啊，瓦赫达提先生？他耸耸肩，那我就说：好咧，老爷。然后我挂上挡，我们就出发了，在城里一转就是好几个小时，没有目标，也没有打算，从一个区到另一个区，沿着喀布尔河，开到巴拉喜萨尔堡，有时出城，就到了达鲁阿曼宫。有的日子，我俩开车离开喀布尔，去加尔加湖。到了那儿，我会把车停在离湖畔不远的地方，关掉引擎，瓦赫达提先生在后座上一动不动地坐着，一个字也不和我说，好像让他心满意足的只是摇下车窗，看着小鸟在树间飞来飞去，阳光播洒在湖面上，散映成千千万万细碎的光斑，在水波中起伏荡漾。我从后视镜里看着他，他也看我，一副天底下最孤单的模样。">查看中文翻译</div>

Whenever I drove into the village, I would be greeted by hordes of hollering children, who would scamper alongside the car, slapping the fender, tapping at the window. Some of the little runts would even try to climb atop the roof, and I would have to shoo them away for fear that they would scratch the paint or cause a dent in the fender.</div>

<div class="line_en">One day, Mr. Wahdati came into the yard wearing a handsome pin-striped suit, one I had never seen on him before, and requested that I drive him to an affluent neighborhood of the city. When we arrived, he instructed me to park on the street outside a beautiful high-walled house, and I watched him ring the bell at the gates and enter when a servant answered. The house was huge, bigger than Mr. Wahdati's, and even more beautiful. Tall, slender cypresses adorned the driveway, along with a densely packed array of bushes of a flower I did not recognize. The backyard was at least twice the size of Mr. Wahdati's, and the walls stood tall enough that if a man climbed on the shoulders of another, he still could hardly steal a peek. This was wealth of another magnitude, I recognized.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一天，瓦赫达提先生走进院子，穿着一套漂亮的条纹西装，我以前从来没见他穿过这身衣服。他让我开车送他去城里另一个富人区。我们到了以后，他告诉我把车停在路边，就在一座围墙高高的房子外面。我看到他在大门口摇响了门铃，有个仆人开门让他进去。那房子巨大，比瓦赫达提先生家还大，甚至还要更漂亮。车道两边植有高大细长的柏树，还有密实的灌木，开着一种我叫不上名字的花。后园至少有瓦赫达提先生家的两倍大，墙很高，要是有人想偷看，那他即便踩着另一个男人的肩膀，恐怕也够不着。我看出来了，这是另一个等级的富户。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After all the fuss about the car died down, I would sit for tea with my sister and Saboor and I would tell them about my life in Kabul. I took care not to say too much about Mr. Wahdati. I was, in truth, quite fond of him, for he treated me well, and speaking of him behind his back seemed to me like a betrayal. If I had been a less discreet employee, I would have told them that Suleiman Wahdati was a mystifying creature to me, a man seemingly satisfied with living the rest of his days off the wealth of his inheritance, a man with no profession, no apparent passion, and apparently no impulse to leave behind something of himself in this world. I would have told them that he lived a life lacking in purpose or direction. Like those aimless rides I took him on. A life lived from the backseat, observed as it blurred by. An indifferent life.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was then that the front gates opened and a black-haired young woman emerged. She wore sunglasses and a short-sleeved tangerine-colored dress that fell short of the knees. Her legs were bare, and so were her feet. I did not know whether she had noticed me sitting in the car, and, if she had, she offered no indication. She rested the heel of one foot against the wall behind her and, when she did, the hem of the dress pulled up slightly and thus revealed a bit of the thigh beneath. I felt a burning spread down from my cheeks to my neck.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在此时，那房子的大门开了，一个黑头发的年轻女人走了出来。她戴着太阳镜，穿一条短袖的橘红色裙子，短至膝盖。她光裸着两腿，双脚也赤露在外。我不知道她是不是注意到了我在车里坐着，可就算她注意到了，我也没看出来。她抬起一只脚，鞋跟踩在身后的墙上，这样一来，她裙子的下摆就稍微拉高了一些，露出了里面的一小截大腿。我感到脸上一下就烧起来了，一路往下，烧到了脖子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was a bright early-summer day, and the sky was brilliant with sunshine. Warm air wafted in through the windows, which I had rolled down. Though a chauffeur's job is to drive, he actually spends most of his time waiting. Waiting outside stores, engine idling; waiting outside a wedding hall, listening to the muffled sound of the music. To pass the time that day, I played a few games of cards. When I tired of cards, I stepped out of the car and took a few steps in one direction, then the other. I sat inside once more, thinking I might steal a nap before Mr. Wahdati returned.</div>

<div class="line_en">Allow me to make another confession here, Mr. Markos, one of a somewhat distasteful nature, leaving little room for elegant handling. At the time, I must have been in my late twenties, a young man at the prime of his desires for a woman's company. Unlike many of the men I grew up with in my village -- young men who had never seen the bare thigh of a grown woman and married, in part, for the license to at last cast their gaze upon such a sight -- I did have some experience. I had found in Kabul, and on occasion visited, establishments where a young man's needs could be addressed with both discretion and convenience. I mention this only to make the point that no whore I had ever lain with could compare with the beautiful, graceful creature who had just stepped out of the big house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说到这儿，请允许我再做一次忏悔吧，马科斯先生。一种令人有几分愧疚的本能，在我心底蠢蠢欲动。那时候我肯定还不到三十岁，是个大小伙子，正处在欲望的高峰，想有女人作伴。我跟我们村里好多同龄的男人不一样——那些小伙子连成年女人光光的大腿都没见过，就结婚了，从某种程度上说，只有结了婚，他们才能获得许可，瞅一瞅这样的大腿。跟他们相比，我真该算得上有些经验了。这些经验是我在喀布尔获得的。我偶尔会去拜访某些地方，到了那儿，一个年轻男人的需要，可以得到既审慎又便利的满足。我这样说只是为了证明，我与之同寝过的娼妓，没有一个比得上眼前这位——这位刚从大宅子里走出来的，美丽的，优雅的造物。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Leaning against the wall, she lit a cigarette and smoked without hurry and with bewitching grace, holding it at the very tip of two fingers and cupping her hand before her mouth each time she raised it to her lips. I watched with rapt attention. The way her hand bent at its slender wrist reminded me of an illustration I had once seen in a glossy book of poems of a long-lashed woman with flowing dark hair lying with her lover in a garden, offering him a cup of wine with her pale delicate fingers. At one point, something seemed to catch the woman's attention up the street in the opposite direction, and I used the brief chance to quickly finger-brush my hair, which was beginning to mat down in the heat. When she turned back, I froze once more. She took a few more puffs, crushed the cigarette against the wall, and sauntered back inside.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她倚靠在墙上，点燃一支香烟，不紧不慢地吸着，带着令人销魂的优雅，用两根手指的指尖夹着烟，每次抬临双唇，手都蜷在嘴前。我看得目不转睛。她这只细腕玉手弓起的模样，让我想起一幅画，那是我从前在一本亮光纸印刷的诗集里看到的，画的是一个妇人，睫毛长长，黑发如瀑，和情人在花园里同寝，她正用细若无骨的手指拿着一杯酒，递给情人。街对面有什么东西，一度吸引了这女人的注意，我利用这短暂的间隙，赶快拿手抓了几下头发，要不然因为天热，头发已经开始粘结成块了。她回过头，我便再次僵坐不动。她又吸了几口，在墙上捻灭了香烟，然后悠闲地走回宅中。">查看中文翻译</div>

The most vocal of these was Zahid, a gardener who came in three days a week to maintain the lawn and trim the trees and bushes, an unpleasant fellow with the repulsive habit of flicking his tongue after each sentence, a tongue with which he cast rumors as offhandedly as he tossed fistfuls of fertilizer. He was part of a group of lifelong laborers who, like me, worked in the neighborhood as cooks, gardeners, and errand men. One or two nights a week, after the workday was over, they squeezed into my shack for after-dinner tea. I do not recall how this ritual started, but, once it did, I was powerless to stop it, wary of seeming rude and inhospitable, or, worse, of appearing to think myself superior to my own kind.</div>

<div class="line_en">Over tea one night, Zahid told the other men that Mr. Wahdati's family did not approve of the marriage because of his bride-to-be's poor character. He said it was well known in Kabul that she had no nang and namoos, no honor, and that though she was only twenty she had already been "ridden all over town" like Mr. Wahdati's car. Worst of all, he said, not only had she made no attempt to deny these allegations, she wrote poems about them. A murmur of disapproval spread through the room when he said this. One of the men remarked that in his village they would have slit her throat by now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有天晚上喝茶的时候，扎希德告诉别的老爷们儿，瓦赫达提先生的家族不同意这门亲事，因为他那没过门的新媳妇品行不端。他说，喀布尔尽人皆知，她既没囊，也没纳穆斯，[2]没有好名声，才二十岁，就敢“在全城到处抛头露面”，跟瓦赫达提先生的小汽车一样。最糟的是，扎希德说，她不仅不否认这些指控，还拿这种事写诗。说到这儿，满屋子响起了一片非难之声。有个男人说，要是在村里，他们早就把她的喉咙割开了。【注：[2]囊（nang）和纳穆斯（namoos）代表荣誉和自尊。】">查看中文翻译</div>

Needless to say, this is a liberty I was not allowed back then and one I would not have accepted even if it had been offered to me.

<div class="line_en">In the mornings, I served Mr. Wahdati his customary breakfast -- a piece of toasted naan, half a cup of walnuts, green tea with a sprinkle of cardamom and no sugar, and a single boiled egg. He liked the yolk to run just so when he punctured the egg, and my initial failures to master this particular consistency had proved a source of considerable anxiety on my part.

<div class="line_en">All morning, as I tended to my chores, I ached for the moment when Nila would push the screen door that opened from the living room out onto the veranda. I would play games in my head, guessing at her appearance that particular day. Would her hair be up, I wondered, tied in a bun at the back of her neck, or would I see it loose, tumbling down over her shoulders? Would she wear sunglasses? Would she opt for sandals? Would she choose the blue silk robe with the belt or the magenta one with the big round buttons?</div>

<div class="line_en">When she made her entrance at last, I would busy myself in the yard, pretending the hood of the car needed wiping, or else I would find a sweetbriar bush to water, but the whole time I watched. I watched when she pushed up her sunglasses to rub her eyes, or when she removed the elastic band from her hair and threw back her head to let the dark lustrous curls fall loose, and I watched when she sat with her chin resting on her knees, staring into the yard, taking languid drags of her cigarette, or when she crossed her legs and bobbed one foot up and down, a gesture that suggested to me boredom or restlessness or perhaps heedless mischief barely held in check.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等她终于亮相，我便在园中瞎忙一气，假装看到车头得擦，或是发现野玫瑰要浇水，不过自始至终，我眼睛都没闲着。我看她把太阳镜推上去，揉着眼睛，看她取下绑头发的橡皮筋，向后甩甩脑袋，抛落一头光亮的卷发，或者看她坐着，下巴搁在膝头，望着院子，懒洋洋地吸烟，又或者双腿交叠，一只脚上下摆荡，这姿势在我看来，代表着无聊或烦躁，或许只是一种难以自控，漫不经心的俏皮。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mr. Wahdati was, on occasion, at her side, but often not. He spent most of his days as he had before, reading in his upstairs study, doing his sketches, his daily routines more or less unaltered by the fact of marriage. Nila wrote most days, either in the living room or else on the veranda, pencil in hand, sheets of paper spilling from her lap, and always the cigarettes. At night, I served them dinner, and they each received the meal in pointed silence, gaze lowered to the platter of rice, the quiet broken only by a muttered Thank you and the tinkling of spoon and fork against china.</div>

<div class="line_en">Once or twice a week, I had to drive Nila when she needed a pack of cigarettes or a fresh set of pens, a new notepad, makeup. If I knew ahead of time that I would be driving her, I always made sure to comb my hair and brush my teeth. I washed my face, rubbed a sliced lemon against my fingers to rid them of the scent of onions, patted the dust off my suit, and polished my shoes. The suit, which was olive colored, was in fact a hand-me-down from Mr. Wahdati, and I hoped that he hadn't told this to Nila -- though I suspected he may have. Not out of malice, but because people in Mr. Wahdati's position often cannot appreciate how small, trivial things like this could bring shame to a man like me. Sometimes, I even wore the lambskin cap that had belonged to my late father. I would stand there before the mirror, tilting the cap this way and that on my head, so absorbed in the act of rendering myself presentable to Nila that if a wasp had landed on my nose it would have had to sting me to make its presence known.</div>

<div class="line_en">Once we were on the road, I looked for minor detours to our destination, if possible, detours designed to prolong the trip by a minute -- or maybe two, but no more lest she grow suspicious -- and thereby extend my time with her. I drove with both hands clenching the wheel, and my eyes firmly on the road. I exercised rigid self-control and did not look at her in the rearview mirror, doing so only if she addressed me. I contented myself with the mere fact of her presence in the backseat, with breathing in her many scents -- expensive soap, lotion, perfume, chewing gum, cigarette smoke. That, most days, was sufficient to lend wings to my spirits.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Now, one day a traveler was passing through, and, of course, he sat with Mullah Shekib for a meal that evening, as is custom. The traveler heard this story and he thought about it, and then he said, 'But, Mullah Sahib, with all due respect, I met a Jew once and I swear his palms bore the very same lines. How do you explain it?' And Mullah said, 'Then the Jew was a Muslim at heart.'"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“后来，有个旅行家路过。理所当然，按照惯例，那天晚上他就和谢基卜毛拉一块吃饭。旅行家听了这个故事，想了好一会儿，然后说：‘可是，谢基卜毛拉，请您恕我直言，我从前遇见过一个犹太人，我发誓他的两只手也有着一模一样的掌纹。这件事您怎样来解释呢？’毛拉说：‘这个嘛，那犹太人骨子里也是个穆斯林。’”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Understand that it wasn't merely her beauty, Mr. Markos, that had me so spellbound, though that alone might have been enough. I had never in my life encountered a young woman like Nila. Everything she did -- the way she spoke, the way she walked, dressed, smiled -- was a novelty to me. Nila pushed against every single notion I had ever had of how a woman was to behave, a trait that I knew met with the stout disapproval of people like Zahid -- and surely Saboor too, and every man in my village, and all the women -- but to me it only added to her already enormous allure and mystery.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="请您理解，马科斯先生，让我神魂颠倒的不只是她的美貌，尽管这美貌已足以让人着迷。我一生中还从未遇见过妮拉这样的年轻女人。她做的一切——说话的方式，走路的样子，穿衣打扮，微笑的模样——事事都让我觉得新奇。对女人如何举手投足，妮拉动摇了我以往所持有的每一种概念。我知道，这些特点必定会遭到某些人顽固的反对，比如扎希德，再比如萨布尔，还有我们村里的所有男人，以及所有女人。可是这些特点对我来说，不过是增加了她本已巨大的诱惑与神秘。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her sudden outburst of laughter bewitched me for the rest of the day. It was as though it -- God forgive me for this blasphemy -- had descended down on me from Heaven itself, the garden of the righteous, as the book says, where rivers flow beneath, and perpetual are the fruits and the shade therein.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="猛然间，她爆发出一阵大笑，直到那天晚上，我都陶醉在这笑声里。就好像——真主宽恕我的不敬——就好像乐园从天堂降临我身，如经书所言，那乐园下临诸河，其中的果实是永恒的，其中的荫影也是永恒的。[3] 【注：[3]见《古兰经》第十三章《雷霆（赖尔得）》，第三十五节。马坚译文。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And so her laughter still rang in my ears as I went about my work that day, and later, when the other workers came over for tea, I grinned and muted their cackles with the sweet tinkle of her laughter, and I prided myself on knowing that my clever story had given her a bit of reprieve from the discontent of her marriage. She was an extraordinary woman, and I went to bed that night feeling like I was perhaps more than ordinary myself. This was the effect she had on me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那一天我干活的时候，甚至后来别的工友过来喝茶的时候，她的笑声还回荡在我耳畔。我龇着牙，美滋滋地，根本听不见他们的叽叽呱呱，耳边只有她那银铃般的笑声，我也很有几分得意，因为我知道自己讲了个聪明的故事，让她从婚姻的不满足中得到了少许的缓解。她真是个非凡的女人。那天夜里上床的时候，我感觉自己好像也有了几分不凡。这就是她对我的影响所在。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Soon, we were conversing daily, Nila and I, usually in the late morning when she sat sipping coffee on the veranda. I would saunter over under the pretense of some task or other and there I was, leaning against a shovel, or tending to a cup of green tea, speaking to her. I felt privileged that she had chosen me. I was not the only servant, after all; I have already mentioned that unscrupulous toad Zahid, and there was a jowly-faced Hazara woman who came twice a week to wash laundry. But it was me she turned to. I was the only one, I believed, including her own husband, with whom her loneliness lifted. She usually did most of the talking, which suited me well; I was happy enough to be the vessel into which she poured her stories. She told me, for instance, of a hunting trip to Jalalabad she had taken with her father and how she had been haunted for weeks by nightmares of dead deer with glassy eyes. She said she had gone with her mother to France when she was a child, before the Second World War. To get there, she had taken both a train and a ship. She described to me how she had felt the jostling of the train wheels in her ribs. And she remembered well the curtains that hung from hooks and the separated compartments, and the rhythmic puff and hiss of the steam engine. She told me of the six weeks she had spent the year before in India with her father when she had been very ill.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不久我们就天天交谈了，妮拉和我，通常是在上午较晚，她坐在游廊上喝咖啡的时候。我会晃悠过去，假装有这样那样的活儿要干，然后倚着铁锹，要么就守着杯绿茶，和她讲话。她能选我，让我感到格外受宠。要知道，我可不是惟一的仆人。我已经提到过那个寡廉鲜耻的癞蛤蟆扎希德了，还有个双下巴、大脸盘的哈扎拉妇人，她每个礼拜来两次，洗衣服。可是妮拉就选了我。我是惟一的人。我相信，连她自己的丈夫也没这福分，和他一起，只会增添她的孤独。一般情况下，都是她说我听，我觉得这样挺好的。能做她一口缸，让她往里倒故事，我已经备感幸福。比方说，她跟我谈起过她和父亲去贾拉拉巴德打猎的事，还说那些死鹿无神的眼睛如何好几个礼拜缠着她不放。她说她小时候和母亲一块儿去过法国，那是第二次世界大战之前的事。一路上，她又坐火车，又搭船。她跟我讲了火车轮子咣当咣当，简直要震断肋骨的感觉。她还清楚地记得吊钩上垂挂的窗帘，相互分隔的卧车包房，以及蒸汽机车有节奏的喷气和嘶鸣。她告诉我，她得过一场大病，去年和她父亲一起，在印度住过六个礼拜。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Now and then, when she turned to tap ash into a saucer, I stole a quick glance at the red polish on her toenails, at the gold-tinged sheen of her shaved calves, the high arch of her foot, and always at her full, perfectly shaped breasts. There were men walking this earth, I marveled, who had touched those breasts and kissed them as they had made love to her. What was left to do in life once you had done that? Where did a man go next once he'd stood at the world's summit? It was only with a great act of will that I would snap my eyes back to a safe spot when she turned to face me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="时不时地，趁她扭头往茶碟里弹烟灰的当口，我便偷偷瞥一眼她那红艳艳的脚指甲，刮过毛的，散发出淡淡金色光华的小腿，还有她高高的足弓，而且，我总要多看一眼她那对饱满的，形状完美的乳房。我真觉得不可思议，有些男人抚摸完这两只乳房，和她做爱，亲吻过它们之后，竟然还能活在世上。难道你做完之后，这辈子还有什么别的追求不成？一个已经站上世界之巅的男人还能再往何处去？可一旦她回过头，面对着我，我便猛然警醒，下意识地收起目光，看着安全的地方。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As she grew more comfortable, she registered with me, during these morning chats, complaints about Mr. Wahdati. She said, one day, that she found him aloof and often arrogant.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随着她越来越放松，我清清楚楚地记得，就在那些上午的闲谈期间，她抱怨起了瓦赫达提先生。有一天她说，她发现他冷漠而傲慢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He has been most generous to me," I said.</div>

<div class="line_en">Politely, I turned my gaze downward. What she said was not entirely untrue. Mr. Wahdati did have, for instance, a habit of correcting my manner of speech with an air of superiority that could be interpreted, perhaps not wrongly, as arrogance. Sometimes I entered the room, placed a platter of sweets before him, refreshed his tea, wiped his crumbs off the table, and he would no more acknowledge me than he would a fly crawling up the screen door, shrinking me into insignificance without even lifting his eyes. In the end, though, this made for a minor quibble, given that I knew people living in the same neighborhood -- people I had worked for -- who beat their servants with sticks and belts.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="出于礼貌，我低下了头。她说的未必不是事实。的确，举个例子来说吧，瓦赫达提先生有一种习惯，老是用一种高高在上的语气，纠正我说话的腔调，也许是的，你可以把这理解为傲慢。有时我走进房间，把一盘甜点放到他面前，给他添上茶，擦掉他桌上的糕饼屑，可他呢，对我不理不睬，好像我都不如爬在纱门上的一只苍蝇。他对我完全无视，连眼皮都不抬一下。说到底，尽管像是小小的诡辩，可我也知道，那些住在同一个住宅区的人——我给他们做过工的人——是打自己仆人的，用棍子打，拿皮带抽。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I was a little startled by her offhand candor. "It is true that Mr. Wahdati is uniquely comfortable with solitude," I said, opting for cautious diplomacy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我被她突如其来的坦率吓了一跳。“确实，瓦赫达提先生非常罕见地安于孤独的状态。”我说，小心谨慎地选择着婉转的措辞。“">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was clear to me that every time I took Nila and Mr. Wahdati to the old woman's house, the air in the backseat would be heavy with tension, and I would know from the pained furrow on Nila's brow that they had quarreled. I remember that when my parents fought, they did not stop until a clear victor had been declared. It was their way of sealing off unpleasantness, to caulk it with a verdict, keep it from leaking into the normalcy of the next day. Not so with the Wahdatis. Their fights didn't so much end as dissipate, like a drop of ink in a bowl of water, with a residual taint that lingered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我当然看得一清二楚，每次我载着妮拉和瓦赫达提先生去那老太婆的家，后座上的气氛都很紧张，颇为压抑。通过妮拉眉头那道痛苦的犁沟，我就能看出来，他俩刚刚吵过架。我还记得，我父母拌嘴的时候，非得有一方获得了完全的胜利，他们才会停战。这就是他们结束争执的方式，用一个结论来堵住怨气，不让它继续外泄，免得第二天没法收拾。瓦赫达提夫妇却不是这样。他俩吵到最后，与其说是吵完，倒不如说吵散了，就像一滴墨汁掉进水碗里，总会残留下一些颜色，久久不去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mr. Wahdati's mother was a heavy, rather pompous woman who lived in another part of town, with the obligatory team of servants and her two beloved dogs. These dogs she doted on and treated not as equals to her servants but as superiors, and by several ranks at that. They were small, hairless, hideous creatures, easily startled, full of anxiety, and prone to a most grating high-pitched bark. I despised them, for no sooner would I enter the house than they would hop on my legs and foolishly try to climb them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="瓦赫达提先生的母亲是个难缠的，相当傲慢的女人，住在喀布尔另一个城区，有一群俯首帖耳的仆人，两条深受宠爱的狗。她对这两条狗格外溺爱，不让它们和仆人平起平坐，而是高过仆人们，高出好几个等级。这是一对矮小，无毛，丑陋的怪物，容易受惊，充满焦虑，动不动就发出刺耳至极的尖叫。我鄙视它们，因为我一进那房子，它俩就往我腿上扑，傻了吧唧地想爬上来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As we carried on with these conversations, Nila and I, one question about her bubbled up again and again in my head. Why had she married Mr. Wahdati? I lacked the courage to ask. Such trespass of propriety was beyond me by nature. I could only infer that for some people, particularly women, marriage -- even an unhappy one such as this -- is an escape from even greater unhappiness.</div>

She said I had served her meals and chauffeured her around Kabul for a year now and she knew scarcely a thing about me. Her request confounded me, to say the least, as it was unusual for someone of her standing to ask to be taken some distance to meet the family of a servant. I was also, in equal measure, buoyed that Nila had taken such keen interest in me and apprehensive, for I anticipated my discomfort -- and, yes, my shame -- when I showed her the poverty into which I had been born.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我想让你带我去趟沙德巴格。”她开口道。她说她想见见我的亲属，看看我的老家。她说我给她做饭，拉着她满喀布尔地转，到现在已经一年，可她对我几乎一无所知。她这个要求把我弄得惊惶失措，退一步说，像她这种身份的人提出来，要大老远地跑去见一个仆人的亲属，也实在很不寻常。我也感到高兴，因为妮拉对我竟有如此强烈的兴趣，可同时我又害怕，因为我提前考虑到了我的不便——还有，是的，我的羞耻——到时候她就会看到我老家的贫穷。">查看中文翻译</div>

But Nila displayed great patience and kindness. She knelt down and smiled, spoke to each of them, shook their hands, stroked their grubby cheeks, tousled their unwashed hair. To my embarrassment, people were gathering for a view of her. There was Baitullah, a childhood friend of mine, looking on from the edge of a roof, squatting with his brothers like a line of crows, all of them chewing naswar tobacco. And there was his father, Mullah Shekib himself, and three white-bearded men sitting in the shade of a wall, listlessly fingering their prayer beads, their ageless eyes fixed on Nila and her bare arms with a look of displeasure.</div>

<div class="line_en">If I had any wish, even at this late hour, to somehow acquit myself, I would say that the bond between Abdullah and his little sister was an ordinary one. But it was not so. No one but God knows why those two had chosen each other. It was a mystery. I have never seen such affinity between two beings. In truth, Abdullah was as much father to Pari as sibling. When she was an infant, when she cried at night, it was he who sprung from the sleeping cot to walk her. It was he who took it upon himself to change her soiled linens, to bundle her up, to soothe her back to sleep. His patience with her was boundless. He carried her around the village, showing her off as though she were the world's most coveted trophy.</div>

The day prior to the party, Nila would give me detailed instructions on what appetizers and meals I was to prepare, and I would drive to the market to purchase the necessary items. Chief among these necessary items was alcohol, which I had never procured before, as Mr. Wahdati did not drink -- though his reasons had nothing to do with religion, he merely disliked its effects. Nila, however, was well acquainted with certain establishments -- pharmacies, as she called them jokingly -- where for the equivalent of double my monthly salary a bottle of medicine could be purchased subversively. I had mixed feelings about running this particular errand, playing the part of sin enabler, but, as always, pleasing Nila superseded everything else.</div>

<div class="line_en">You must understand, Mr. Markos, that when we had parties in Shadbagh, be it for a wedding or to celebrate a circumcision, the proceedings took place at two separate houses, one for women, the other for us men. At Nila's parties, men and women mingled with one another. Most of the women dressed as Nila did, in dresses that showed the entire lengths of their arms and a good deal of their legs as well. They smoked, and they drank too, their glasses half filled with colorless or red- or copper-colored liquor, and they told jokes and laughed and freely touched the arms of men I knew to be married to someone else in the room. I carried small platters of bolani and lola kabob from one end of the smoke-filled room to the other, from one cluster of guests to another, as a record played on the turntable. The music was not Afghan but something Nila called jazz, a kind of music that, I learned decades later, you appreciate as well, Mr. Markos. To my ears, the random tinkling of piano and the strange wailing of horns sounded an inharmonious mess. But Nila loved it, and I kept overhearing her telling guests how they simply had to hear this recording or that. All night, she held a glass and tended to it far more than the food I served.</div>

Nila wrote about love, and by love I do not mean the Sufi yearnings of Rumi or Hafez but instead physical love. She wrote about lovers whispering across pillows, touching each other. She wrote about pleasure. I had never heard language such as this spoken by a woman. I would stand there, listening to Nila's smoky voice drift down the hallway, my eyes closed and my ears burning red, imagining she was reading to me, that we were the lovers in the poem, until someone's call for tea or fried eggs would break the spell, and then Nila would call my name and I would run.</div>

It was a good thing I did for it was not until two hours later that I saw her slim figure gliding down the sidewalk toward the car.

<div class="line_en">Let me say, Mr. Markos, that I proceeded with a mostly clean conscience, and with the conviction that my proposal was born of goodwill and honest intentions. Something that, though painful in the short term, would lead to a greater long-term good for all involved. But I had less honorable, self-serving motives as well. Chief among them this: that I would give Nila something no other man -- not her husband, not the owner of that big pink house -- could.</div>

<div class="line_en">I spoke to Saboor first. In my defense, I will say that if I had thought Saboor would accept money from me, I gladly would have given it to him in lieu of this proposal. I knew he needed the money for he had told me of his struggles finding work. I would have borrowed an advance against my salary from Mr. Wahdati for Saboor to see his family through the winter. But Saboor, like many of my countrymen, had the affliction of pride, an affliction both misbegotten and unshakable. He would never take money from me. When he married Parwana, he even put an end to the small remittances I had been giving her. He was a man and he would provide for his own family. And he died doing just that, when he was not yet forty, collapsing one day while he was out harvesting a field of sugar beets somewhere near Baghlan. I heard he died with the beet hook still in his blistered, bleeding hands.</div>

<div class="line_en">I was not a father and thus will make no pretense at understanding the anguished deliberations that led to Saboor's decision. Nor was I privy to the discussions between the Wahdatis. Once I revealed the idea to Nila, I only asked that in her discussions with Mr. Wahdati she put forth the idea as her own and not mine. I knew that Mr. Wahdati would resist. I had never glimpsed in him a sliver of paternal instinct. In fact, I had wondered if Nila's inability to bear children may have swayed his decision to marry her. Regardless, I steered clear of the tense atmosphere between the two. When I lay down to sleep at night, I saw only the sudden tears that had leaked from Nila's eyes when I told her and how she had taken both my hands and gazed into me with gratitude and -- I was sure of it -- something quite like love. I thought only of the fact that I was offering her a gift that men with far greater prospects could not. I thought only of how thoroughly I had given myself over to her, and how happily.

I will never fully understand why he chose to instead walk his daughter from Shadbagh. Or why he allowed Abdullah to come along. Perhaps he was clinging to what little time he had left with his daughter. Perhaps he sought a measure of penance in the hardship of the journey. Or perhaps it was Saboor's pride, and he would not ride in the car of the man who was buying his daughter. But, in the end, there they were, the three of them, coated in dust, waiting, as agreed, near the mosque.

<div class="line_en">Mr. Wahdati's chilly reception of Pari lasted only a brief time before, perhaps to his own surprise, little Pari's tearful anxiety and homesickness disarmed him. Soon, Pari joined us on our morning strolls. Mr. Wahdati lowered her into a stroller and pushed her around the neighborhood as we walked. Or else he sat her up on his lap behind the wheel of the car and smiled patiently while she pushed the horn. He hired a carpenter and had him build a three-drawer trundle bed for Pari, a maple chest for toys, and a small, short armoire. He had all the furniture in Pari's room painted yellow since he had discovered this was her favorite color. And I found him one day sitting cross-legged before the armoire, Pari at his side, as he painted, with rather remarkable skill, giraffes and long-tailed monkeys over its doors. It should speak volumes about his private nature, Mr. Markos, when I tell you that in all the years I had watched him sketch, this was the first time I had actually laid eyes on his artwork.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="瓦赫达提先生对帕丽的冷淡反应只持续了很短的时间，然后，可能也出乎他本人意料，眼泪汪汪、忧心忡忡、思乡切切的小帕丽便融化了他的心。很快，帕丽便加入了我们早晨的散步活动。瓦赫达提先生把她放进童车，我们散步的时候，他便推着她，在附近到处转悠，要不然就坐到汽车方向盘后面，把她放到自己腿上，让她按喇叭，而他笑眯眯的，不急也不躁。他雇了个木匠，让他给帕丽打了一张有三个抽屉，带脚轮的床，一个装玩具的大枫木箱，还有一个小小的，矮矮的衣橱。他把这些家具都放进帕丽的房间，那屋里刷成了黄色，因为他发现这是她最喜欢的颜色。有一天，我瞅见他盘着腿坐在衣橱前，帕丽待在他旁边，看他用出色的技艺，往橱门上画长颈鹿和长尾巴猴子。这应该算是他深藏不露的内心得到了释放，马科斯先生，我跟您说，那么多年了，我老是看他画呀画呀，可这还是头一回，我亲眼见到他的作品。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Pari was nearly four years old at the time, but, despite her young age, there were forces in her life that needed to be reshaped. She was instructed not to call me Kaka Nabi any longer, for instance, but simply Nabi. And her mistakes were gently corrected, by me included, over and over until she came to believe that we bore no relation to each other. I became for her Nabi the cook and Nabi the driver.

<div class="line_en">The other consequence of Pari's arrival was one I had not anticipated: I receded into the background. Judge me charitably, Mr. Markos, and remember that I was a young man, but I admit I had hopes, foolish as they might have been. I was the instrument of Nila's becoming a mother, after all. I had uncovered the source of her unhappiness and delivered an antidote. Did I think we would become lovers now? I want to say I was not so foolish as that, Mr. Markos, but that wouldn't be entirely truthful. I suspect the truth is that we are waiting, all of us, against insurmountable odds, for something extraordinary to happen to us.</div>

<div class="line_en">One of the effects of Pari's entrance was that for the first time the Wahdati household resembled a proper family. Bound now by their affection for Pari, Nila and her husband took all their meals together. They walked Pari to a nearby park and sat contentedly beside each other on a bench to watch her play. When I served them tea at night after I had cleared the table, I often found one or the other reading a children's book to Pari as she reclined on their laps, she, with each passing day, more forgetful of her past life in Shadbagh and of the people in it.</div>

Most of them I had rarely seen at the house, and I understood that they were clocking in an appearance more to pay respect to Mr. Wahdati's matronly mother than to see the reclusive sick man with whom they had but a tenuous connection. She came too, of course, the mother -- minus the dogs, thank goodness. She burst into the house bearing a handkerchief in each hand to blot at her reddened eyes and dripping nose. She planted herself at his bedside and wept. Also, she wore black, which appalled me, as though her son were already dead.</div>

<div class="line_en">This was not entirely true, however. Indeed, after the first week or so he made his feelings quite clear about the visitors, his mother included. He was, even in such extreme sickness, a fundamentally solitary creature. And he had no use for their pity, their woebegone looks, all the forlorn headshaking at the wretched spectacle he had become. When they entered his room, he waved his functional left hand in an angry shooing motion. When they spoke to him, he turned his cheek. If they sat at his side, he clutched a handful of bedsheet and grunted and pounded the fist against his hip until they left. With Pari, his dismissal was no less insistent, if far gentler. She came to play with her dolls at his bedside, and he looked up at me pleadingly, his eyes watering, his chin quivering, until I led her out of the room -- he did not try to speak with her for he knew his speech upset her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而这不完全是事实。其实只过了一个来礼拜，他对来访者的感受，包括对他母亲的态度，就表露得相当清楚了。即使病到这个分上，他也不改孤独者的本性。他不需要他们的怜悯，不需要他们愁眉苦脸的表情，更不要他们绝望地摇着头，把他当成惨绝人寰的奇景。他们一走进他的房间，他就挥起能动的左手，做出愤怒的，往外轰人的动作。他们和他说话，他就把脸扭过去。如果他们坐到他身边，他就挠床单，哼哼着，拿拳头捶自己的屁股，直到人家离开。和帕丽在一起的时候，他的封闭程度丝毫不减，只是温和了许多。她带着玩具过来，在他床头玩，这时他便仰望着我，满脸恳求的神色，眼中含着泪，下巴颤抖着，直到我把帕丽领出房间。他不打算和孩子讲什么，因为他知道自己一开口，就会让她伤心。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And, in a way, he was. At least the old version of him. Half of his face was now a frozen mask. His legs were almost of no service. He had movement of the left arm, but the right was only bone and flaccid meat. He spoke with hoarse grunts and moans that no one could decipher.</div>

<div class="line_en">The great visitor exodus came as a relief to Nila. When people were packing the house wall to wall, Nila retreated upstairs into Pari's bedroom with her, much to the disgust of the mother-in-law, who doubtless expected -- and, really, who could blame her?-- Nila to remain at her son's side, at least for the sake of appearances if nothing else. Of course Nila cared nothing about appearances or what might be said about her. And plenty was. "What sort of wife is this?" I heard the mother-in-law exclaim more than once. She complained to anyone who would listen that Nila was heartless, that she had a gaping hole in her soul. Where was she now that her husband needed her? What sort of wife abandoned her loyal, loving husband?</div>

She came once a week or so. She would snap her fingers at me and I would pull up a chair for her, and no sooner had she plopped down next to her son's bed than she would launch into a soliloquy of assaults on the character of his now departed wife. She was a harlot. A liar. A drunk. A coward who had run to God knows where when her husband needed her most. This, Mr. Wahdati would bear in silence, looking impassively past her shoulder at the window. Then came an interminable stream of news and updates, much of it almost physically painful in its banality. A cousin who had argued with her sister because her sister had had the gall to buy the same exact coffee table as she. Who had got a flat tire on the way home from Paghman last Friday.

There were stacks of books on which dust had collected, and I wiped those as well. I cleaned his shoes with a cloth and lined them all up in a neat row. I found a large cardboard box, nearly shielded from view by the hems of several long winter coats draping over it. I pulled it toward me and opened it. It was full of Mr. Wahdati's old sketchbooks, one stacked atop another, each a sad relic of his past life.</div>

<div class="line_en">One day, I went up to his room and told him that I had a surprise for him. This was sometime in the late 1950s, long before television had made its way to Kabul. He and I passed our time those days playing cards, and, of late, chess, which he had taught me and for which I was showing a bit of a knack. We also spent considerable time with reading lessons. He proved a patient teacher. He would close his eyes as he listened to me read and shake his head gently when I erred. Again, he would say. By then, his speech had improved quite dramatically over time. Read that again, Nabi. I had been more or less literate when he had hired me back in 1947, thanks to Mullah Shekib, but it was through Suleiman's tutoring that my reading truly advanced, as did my writing by consequence. He did it to help me, of course, but there was also a self-serving element to the lessons for I now could read to him books that he liked. He could read them on his own, naturally, but only for short bursts, as he tired easily.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一天，我走进他的房间，说我有个惊喜给他。那是五十年代末，还要过很长时间，喀布尔才会有电视可看。那些日子里，他和我玩扑克来打发时间，后来下象棋，他教我，下起棋来，慢慢地我也能露一小手。我们也花了相当多的时间上阅读课。实践证明，他是个很有耐心的老师。我朗读的时候，他闭着眼睛听，要是读错了，他就轻轻摇一摇头。再来。他说。那个时候，久而久之，他的语言能力已经有了相当惊人的改善。再读一遍，纳比。1947年，他刚雇我的时候，我多多少少也算是识字的，这得多亏谢基卜毛拉，可是通过苏莱曼的辅导，我的阅读才真正有了提高，写作能力也因此大为进步。他教我，当然是为了帮我，可是他给我上课也有自私的成分，因为现在我能读他喜欢的书给他听了。不用说，他自己也能读，可是只能读一小会儿，因为他很容易疲倦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">How was I to stay on now? I wondered. I was neither disgusted nor flattered by the discovery I had made, Mr. Markos, but I was discomfited. I tried to picture how I could stay, knowing what I knew now. It cast a pall over everything, what I had found in the box. A thing like this could not be escaped, pushed aside. Yet how could I leave while he was in such a helpless state? I could not, not without first finding someone suitable to take over my duties. I owed Mr. Wahdati at least that much because he had always been good to me, while I, on the other hand, had maneuvered behind his back to gain his wife's favors.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我该不该留下来？我不知道。对此前的发现，我既不觉得恶心，也没感到荣幸，马科斯先生，可我确实心烦意乱。我想弄明白，在知道自己已经知道的情况下，怎么才能留下来。我在纸箱里发现的那些东西，让事事都蒙上了一层尸布。这种事没有办法逃避，由不得你把它抛在一边。可是他处在这样一种无助的状态，我又怎能撒手不管？我不能，除非先找到合适的人选，接手我的工作。我欠瓦赫达提先生的，最起码他一直待我很好，另一方面，我也曾背着他，讨他妻子的欢心。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It would merit mentioning here that I did at first search for a replacement for myself. I did not tell Suleiman I was doing so; I thought it best to find the right person and then bring the news to him. A number of people came to inquire about the work. I met with them outside the house so as to not rouse suspicion in Suleiman. But the search proved far more problematic than I had anticipated. Some of the candidates were clearly made of the same cloth as Zahid, and those -- whom I sniffed out easily due to my lifelong dealings with their sort -- I dismissed swiftly. Others didn't have the necessary cooking skills, for, as I mentioned earlier, Suleiman was a rather fussy eater. Or they could not drive. Many could not read, which was a serious impediment now that I habitually read to Suleiman late in the afternoons. Some I found to be impatient, another grave shortcoming when it came to caring for Suleiman, who could be exasperating and at times childishly petulant. Others I intuitively judged to lack the necessary temperament for the arduous task at hand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="应该在这儿说一下，一开始，我确实给自己找过继任者。找人的事我没告诉苏莱曼。我觉得最好还是先找到合适的人选，然后再跟他说。来打听工作的人不少，我到房子外面和他们见面，以免让苏莱曼生疑。可是找人找到后来，问题远比我预想的要多。有些应征者明显就是扎希德一路的货色，我跟这种人打了一辈子交道，他们什么味儿，我马上就能闻得出来，所以当场就把他们打发走了。还有些人没有必需的厨艺，我以前说过，苏莱曼是个相当挑剔的食客。另外一些人不会开车。许多都不识字，这是个很严重的障碍，因为习惯已经养成，每天黄昏前，我都要给苏莱曼读书。我发现有些人没耐心，如果要照顾苏莱曼的话，这就是另一个严重的缺陷，因为他很容易动怒，有时候会耍小孩子脾气。还有些人，我凭直觉感到，他们缺乏必要的性情，来承担手头这份艰巨的工作。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And so three years on, I was still at the house, still telling myself I intended to leave once I felt assured Suleiman's fate was in hands I could trust. Three years on, I was still the one washing his body every other day with a wet cloth, shaving his face, clipping his nails, cutting his hair. I fed him his food and helped him on the bedpan, and I wiped him clean, the way you do an infant, and I washed the soiled diapers I pinned on him. In that time, we had developed between us an unspoken language born of familiarity and routine, and, inevitably, a degree of previously unthinkable informality had seeped into our relationship.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是三年过去了，我还留在这宅子里，还在不停地跟自己说，只要我觉得能把苏莱曼的命运交到可信赖的人手里，我就考虑离开。三年过去了，还是我在给他擦洗身子，用一块湿布，两天擦一次，还是我在给他刮脸，剪指甲，理发。我喂他吃东西，扶他躺便盆，再给他擦干净，就像人家收拾婴儿一样，我也得给他垫尿布，尿布脏了我来洗。在那段时间里，由于亲密无间和例行公事，我们之间发展出了一种无需开口的语言，而且不可避免地，一种以前难以想像的不拘礼节，已经慢慢渗入到了我们的关系里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Once I got him to agree to the wheelchair, the old ritual of morning strolls was restored. I wheeled him out of the house, and we would go down the street and say hello to the neighbors as we passed by. One of them was Mr. Bashiri, a young, recent graduate of Kabul University who worked for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He, his brother, and their respective wives had moved into a big two-story home three houses down across the street from us. Sometimes we ran into him as he was warming up his car in the morning to go to work, and I always stopped for a few pleasantries. I often wheeled Suleiman over to Shar-e-Nau Park, where we sat in the shade of the elms and watched the traffic -- the taxi drivers pounding palms against horns, the ding-a-ding of bicycles, donkeys braying, pedestrians suicidally stepping into the path of buses. We became a familiar sight, Suleiman and I, in and around the park. On the way home, we paused often for good-humored exchanges with magazine vendors and butchers, a few cheerful words with the young policemen directing traffic. We chatted up drivers leaning against their fenders, waiting for pickups.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一旦我让他接受了轮椅，早晨散步的老习惯便恢复了。我把他推出家门，推到街上，一边走，一边跟路过的邻居们打招呼。其中有位年轻的巴希里先生，刚从喀布尔大学毕业，去了外交部工作。他和他哥哥带着各自的妻子，搬进了一幢两层的房子，就在我们家马路对面，隔着三户人家就是。有时我们在早上碰到他，他正在暖车，准备去上班，我总要停下来，开几句玩笑。我经常推着苏莱曼去沙尔瑙公园，坐在榆树的树荫下，看人来车往——出租车司机举起大巴掌，猛拍车喇叭，自行车叮叮作响，驴儿欢叫，行人找死，跟公共汽车抢道。在公园里，在公园外，苏莱曼和我，我俩成了常见的一景。在回家的路上，我们常常停步，和卖杂志的摊主、卖肉的屠户说说笑笑，跟指挥交通的那些年轻警察，我们也能逗上几句。我们还和那些倚着挡泥板、等人坐车的司机搭讪。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sometimes I lowered him into the backseat of the old Chevrolet, stowed the wheelchair in the trunk, and drove out to Paghman, where I could always find a pretty green field and a bubbling little stream shaded by trees. He tried his hand at sketching after we ate lunch, but it was a struggle, for the stroke had affected his dominant right hand. Still, using his left hand, he managed to recreate trees and hills and bundles of wildflowers with far greater artistry than I could with my intact faculties. Eventually, Suleiman would tire and doze off, the pencil slipping from his hand. I would cover his legs with a blanket and lie on the grass beside his chair. I would listen to the breeze catching the trees, gaze up at the sky, the strips of clouds gliding overhead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有时，我把他塞进老雪佛兰的后座，轮椅收进后备厢，开车出城，去帕格曼。到了那儿，我总能找到一片漂亮的绿地，树荫下小溪潺潺。我俩吃完午饭，他便动手写生，但这实在艰难，因为中风影响了他惯用的右手。可他拿左手也画出了树林、群山，还有一簇簇野花，就算我把两只好手都用上，也远远不及他技艺精湛。最后，要是苏莱曼累了，就会打起瞌睡，铅笔从手中滑落。我就用毯子给他盖上腿，挨着他的轮椅，躺到草地上。我会听微风在林中婉转，看着天空，一条条云彩高高地游走不定。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sooner or later, I would find my thoughts drifting to Nila, who was an entire continent away from me now. I would picture the soft sheen of her hair, the way she bounced her foot, the sandal slapping her heel to the crackle of a burning cigarette. I thought of the curve of her back and the swell of her chest. I longed to be near her again, to be engulfed in her smell, to feel the old familiar flutter of the heart when she touched my hand. She had promised to write me, and though years had passed and in all likelihood she had forgotten me, I cannot lie now and claim I did not still feel an upsurge of anticipation each time we received correspondence at the house.</div>

I often spotted the little baby cousins in their strollers as their mothers took them for leisurely walks around the neighborhood.

I cannot tell you when or how the change occurred, Mr. Markos, only that I was staying for me now. Suleiman said I should marry. But the fact is, I looked at my life and realized I already had what people sought in marriage. I had comfort, and companionship, and a home where I was always welcomed, loved, and needed. The physical urges I had as a man -- and I still had them, of course, though less frequent and less pressing now that I was older -- could still be managed, as I explained earlier. As for children, though I had always liked them I had never felt a tug of paternal impulse in myself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我没再说什么，哪怕他理解错了。这一次我可没开玩笑。我之所以留下来，已经不再是为了他。一开始的确如此。我留下，首先是因为苏莱曼需要我，因为他完全依赖我。从前有一次，我抛弃了需要我的人，悔恨至今挥之不去，并终将伴我到死。我不能再这样做了。然而，慢慢地，难以觉察地，我留下的理由起了变化。马科斯先生，我没法告诉您这种变化是什么时候发生的，又是怎样发生的，可后来我是为自己而留下来的。苏莱曼说我应该结婚。然而实际上，看看自己的生活，我就意识到了，我已经拥有了人们在婚姻中追求的东西。我拥有了舒适、伴侣，以及一个随时都能接纳我，爱我，需要我的家。作为一个男人，我生理上的需求——当然了，这种需求仍然存在，不过随着年龄的增长，此时已经不那么频繁，也没那么迫切了——还是有办法解决的，怎么解决，我先前说过了。至于孩子，虽然我一向喜欢小孩，可是从来没感到自己父爱缠身。">查看中文翻译</div>

Not one, not two, but many wars, both big and small, just and unjust, wars with shifting casts of supposed heroes and villains, each new hero making one increasingly nostalgic for the old villain. The names changed, as did the faces, and I spit on them equally for all the petty feuds, the snipers, the land mines, bombing raids, the rockets, the looting and raping and killing. Ah, enough! The task is both too great and too unpleasant. I lived those days already, and I intend to relive them on these pages as briefly as possible.

<div class="line_en">The 1980s, as you know, Mr. Markos, were actually not so terrible in Kabul since most of the fighting took place in the countryside. Still, it was a time of exodus, and many families from our neighborhood packed their things and left the country for either Pakistan or Iran, with hopes of resettling somewhere in the West. I remember vividly the day Mr. Bashiri came to say good-bye. I shook his hand and wished him well. I said my farewells also to his son, Idris, who had grown into a tall, lanky fourteen-year-old with long hair and peach fuzz above his lip. I told Idris I would miss very much the sight of him and his cousin Timur flying kites and playing soccer on the street. You may recall that we met the cousins many years later, you and I, Mr. Markos, when they were grown men, at a party you threw at the house in the spring of 2003.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如您所知，马科斯先生，八十年代的喀布尔确实还没有那么可怕，因为战斗大部分发生在农村。尽管如此，那却是个逃亡的年代，附近许多家庭收拾了细软，离开了这个国家，要么去巴基斯坦，要么去伊朗，盼望着从那儿前往西方某个国家落脚。我清清楚楚地记得巴希里先生过来道别的那天。我和他握了手，祝他一帆风顺。我还和他儿子伊德里斯道了再见，他那会儿已经十四岁了，又瘦又高，留着长发，嘴唇上边已经冒出了软毛。我告诉伊德里斯，他和他堂弟铁木尔一起放风筝，在马路上踢足球的那些景象，一定会让我非常怀念。您大概还记得，很多年以后，咱们见过那对堂兄弟，马科斯先生，您和我一起见的，那是2003年的春天，您在这宅子里开了个派对，当时他们已经是成年人了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was in the 1990s that fighting at last broke out within the city limits. Kabul fell prey to men who looked like they had tumbled out of their mothers with Kalashnikov in hand, Mr. Markos, vandals all of them, gun-toting thieves with grandiose, self-given titles. When the rockets began to fly, Suleiman stayed in the house and refused to leave. He stoutly declined information about what was going on outside the walls of his house. He unplugged the television. He cast aside the radio. He had no use for newspapers. He asked that I not bring home any news of the fighting. He scarcely knew who was battling whom, who was winning, who was losing, as though he hoped that by doggedly ignoring the war it would return the favor.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was during those years, Mr. Markos, that the house absorbed most of the damage that you witnessed when you first saw it in 2002. Granted, some of it was due to the passage of time and neglect -- I had aged into an old man by then and no longer had the wherewithal to tend to the house as I once had. The trees were dead by then -- they had not borne fruit in years -- the lawn had yellowed, the flowers perished. But war was ruthless on the once beautiful house. Windows shattered by nearby RPG blasts. A rocket pulverized the wall on the eastern face of the garden as well as half of the veranda, where Nila and I had held so many conversations. A grenade damaged the roof. Bullets scarred the walls.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这幢房子遭到的大部分破坏，都是那几年造成的，马科斯先生，您2002年第一次来这儿时，已经亲眼见到了这些破坏。虽然说，有些损伤是由于年久失修和疏于打理，因为那时我已经上了年纪，成了个老头子，再也没有力气像以前那样照看这房子了，树已经好多年不结果，都死了，草坪一片枯黄，花也谢了，但是，对这座漂亮房子最冷酷无情的，还是战争。枪榴弹在附近爆炸，震碎了窗户。一枚火箭炸毁了花园的东墙和半个游廊，就是在那儿，妮拉和我有过许多次的交谈。手雷毁坏了房顶。子弹在墙上留下累累伤痕。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Of course it did not. The street where we lived, once so quiet and pristine and gleaming, turned into a war zone. Bullets hit every house. Rockets whistled overhead. RPGs landed up and down the street and blasted craters in the asphalt. At night, red-and-white tracers flew every which way until dawn. Some days, we would have a bit of reprieve, a few hours of quiet, and then sudden bursts of fire would break it, rounds cracking off from every direction, people on the street screaming.</div>

<div class="line_en">And then the looting, Mr. Markos. Militiamen would walk in at will and make off with whatever struck their fancy. They whisked away most of the furniture, the paintings, the Turkoman rugs, the statues, the silver candlesticks, the crystal vases. They chiseled loose lapis tiles from the bathroom counters. I woke one morning to the sound of men in the foyer. I found a band of Uzbek militiamen ripping the rug from the stairwell with a set of curved knives. I stood by and watched them. What could I do? What was another old man with a bullet in the head to them?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着就是抢劫，马科斯先生。民兵大摇大摆地走进来，见到喜欢的东西，拿了就走。他们抢走了大部分家具、油画、土库曼地毯、雕像、银烛台、水晶花瓶。他们敲掉了卫生间台子上的青金石花砖。有一天早晨，我被门厅里的人声弄醒，发现有一群乌兹别克民兵，拿着弯刀，正在割楼梯上的地毯。我站在旁边看着他们。我能怎么办？再来一个脑袋瓜挨枪子儿的老头子，对他们又算得了什么？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Like the house, Suleiman and I too were wearing down. My eyesight dimmed, and my knees took to aching most days. Forgive me this vulgarity, Mr. Markos, but the mere act of urinating turned into a test of endurance. Predictably, the aging hit Suleiman harder than it did me. He shrank and became thin and startlingly frail. Twice, he nearly died, once during the worst days of the fighting between Ahmad Shah Massoud's group and Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's, when bodies lay unclaimed for days on the streets. Suleiman had pneumonia that time, which the doctor said he got from aspirating his own saliva. Though both doctors and the medicines they prescribed were in short supply, I managed to nurse Suleiman back from what was surely the brink of death.</div>

Of course I would merely go down the street somewhere and smoke -- a new habit, the smoking, acquired late in life -- though I did it only when I was angry. Sometimes I stayed out for hours. And if he had really roiled me up, I would stay out until dark. But I always came back.

<div class="line_en">Eventually, the fighting ended with the arrival of the Taliban, those sharp-faced young men with dark beards, kohl-rimmed eyes, and whips. Their cruelty and excesses have also been well documented, and once again I see little reason to enumerate them for you, Mr. Markos. I should say that their years in Kabul were, ironically enough, a time of personal reprieve for me. They saved the bulk of their contempt and zealotry for the young, especially the poor women. Me, I was an old man. My main concession to their regime was to grow a beard, which, frankly, spared me the meticulous task of a daily shave.</div>

<div class="line_en">I walked over to the window and sat, Suleiman's cup of tea still on the platter at my feet. It was a sunny morning, I remember. Shops would open soon, if they hadn't already. Little boys heading off to school. The dust rising already. A dog loped lazily up the street escorted by a dark cloud of mosquitoes swirling around its head. I watched two young men ride past on a motorcycle. The passenger, straddling the rear carrier pack, had hoisted a computer monitor on one shoulder, a watermelon on the other.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我走到窗前坐下。苏莱曼那杯茶还在，还放在盘中，搁在我脚边。我记得，那是个阳光明媚的早晨。晚起的店家很快就要开门。小男孩走在上学的路上。已然尘土飞扬。马路上走着一条懒洋洋的狗，蚊子如黑云，围着狗头盘旋。我看见两个小伙子合骑一辆摩托车，后面那位跨坐在车尾的货架上，一边肩膀上扛着台电脑显示器，另一边是西瓜。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">How long did I sit there by him? How long did I try to negotiate? I cannot tell you, Mr. Markos. I do remember that I finally rose, walked around the side of the bed, and lay down next to him. I rolled him over so he faced me. He felt light as a dream. I placed a kiss on his dry, cracked lips. I put a pillow between his face and my chest and reached for the back of his head. I held him against me in a long, tight embrace.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我在他身边坐了多久？劝了他多久？我无法告诉您，马科斯先生。只记得最后我站起身，在床头走来走去，终于躺到他身边。我把他转过来，让他面对着我。他好轻，轻得像一个梦。我亲吻他干裂的双唇。我把枕头放到胸前，挨着他的脸，然后捧住他的后脑勺。我把他搂在怀里。一个长长的、紧紧的拥抱。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The note in Suleiman's drawer was a will in which he had left me everything. The house, his money, his personal belongings, even the car, though it had long decayed. Its carcass still sat in the backyard on flat tires, a sagging hulk of rusted-over metal.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苏莱曼抽屉里的字条是一份遗嘱，写明他把一切都留给我。这房子，他的钱，他个人的财物，甚至那辆汽车，尽管它朽烂已久，尸首却栖留于后园，车胎尽瘪，徒然一堆锈蚀不堪、委顿于地的铁皮。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For a time, I was quite literally at a loss as to what to do with myself. For more than half a century I had looked after Suleiman. My daily existence had been shaped by his needs, his companionship. Now I was free to do as I wished, but I found the freedom illusory, for what I wished for the most had been taken from me. They say, Find a purpose in your life and live it. But, sometimes, it is only after you have lived that you recognize your life had a purpose, and likely one you never had in mind. And now that I had fulfilled mine, I felt aimless and adrift.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一段时间，我真真确确地感到手足无措，不知道拿自己怎么办才好。半个多世纪了，我一直都在照顾苏莱曼。我每天的生活都囿于他的需要，始终都有他的陪伴。现在我自由了，可以做我想做的事，但我发现这自由不过是个错觉，因为我最想做的事已不复存在。人家说，去发现，发现你生活的目标，然后去过那样的生活。可是有的时候，你只有生活过，才能认识到早已有了生活的目标，也许这目标你从来不曾想到。现在我的目标已经实现了，我觉得自己失去了方向，只剩下了随波逐流。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I found I could not sleep in the house any longer; I could hardly stay in it. With Suleiman gone, it felt far too big. And every corner, every nook and cranny, evoked ripe memories. So I moved back into my old shack at the far end of the yard. I paid some workers to install electricity in the shack so that I would have a light to read by and a fan to keep me cool in the summer. As for space, I did not need much. My possessions amounted to little more than a bed, some clothes, and the box containing Suleiman's drawings. I know this may strike you as odd, Mr. Markos. Yes, legally the house and everything in it belonged to me now, but I felt no true sense of ownership over any of it, and I knew I never really would.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我发现自己在大房里怎么也睡不好了，我在里面待都待不下去。苏莱曼一死，我就感觉这房子太大了。每个角落，每个暗处，每条裂缝，都隐藏着鲜活的记忆。所以我搬回到了院子尽头的老窝棚。我花钱请了几个工人，在棚子里通上电，好让我能就着灯光读书，到了夏天，可以吹吹电扇。至于空间，我需要的不多。我的财产加起来，不过就是一张床，几身衣服，还有那个装着苏莱曼画稿的纸箱。我知道，马科斯先生，您可能会觉得这有些古怪。的确，从法律上来说，这房子，还有这房子里的一切，现在都属于我了，可我对任何一件东西都没有主人的真情实感，而我也知道，我永远也不能真的产生那种感觉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I read quite a bit, books I took from Suleiman's old study. I returned each when I had finished. I planted some tomatoes, a few sprigs of mint. I went for walks around the neighborhood, but my knees often ached before I had covered even two blocks, forcing me to return. Sometimes I pulled up a chair in the garden and just sat idly. I was not like Suleiman: Solitude did not suit me well.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我读了很多书，从苏莱曼的旧书房里拿的。每次一读完，我就把它们放回去。我种了些番茄，一点儿薄荷。我到附近散步，可是膝盖老是疼，后来我索性走到两个街区之外，再强迫自己往回走。有时候我搬上一把椅子，到花园里干坐着，无所事事。我跟苏莱曼可不一样：我习惯不了孤独。">查看中文翻译</div>

Through the translator, you said you were from Tinos, which was an island in Greece. You were a surgeon, part of a medical group that had come to Kabul to operate on children who had suffered injuries to their face. You said you and your colleagues needed a residence, a guesthouse, as it is called these days.</div>

<div class="line_en">The translator drew himself forward to the edge of his chair and leaned toward me. He spoke in a confidential tone.

<div class="line_en">I told him to remove his sunglasses when he spoke to an elder. Then I instructed him to do his job, which was to translate, not give advice, and I turned to you and offered, among my many reasons, the one that was not private. "You have left behind your country," I said, "your friends, your family, and you have come here to this godforsaken city to help my homeland and my countrymen. How could I profit off you?"</div>

<div class="line_en">She is dead now, this I know. I learned it from Miss Amra. I had told her about the Wahdatis and shared with her that Nila had been a poet. She found a French publication on the computer. They had published online an anthology of their best pieces of the last forty years. There was one about Nila. The piece said she had died in 1974. I thought of the futility of all those years, hoping for a letter from a woman who was already long dead. I was not altogether surprised to learn that she had taken her own life. I know now that some people feel unhappiness the way others love: privately, intensely, and without recourse.</div>

I can hear the music too, and at times it is jazz, which reminds me of Nila.</div>
