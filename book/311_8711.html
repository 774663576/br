<div class="line_en">Eleanor laughed with her, and stood there for a few seconds smiling. Her mom was wearing soft old jeans and a T-shirt, and her hair was pulled back in a smooth ponytail. She looked almost like she used to. There was a picture of her -- at one of Maisie's birthday parties, scooping ice cream cones -- with a ponytail just like that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃莉诺跟着一起笑，她在那儿站了几秒钟，一直微笑着。她妈妈穿着老旧的软牛仔裤和T恤，头发向后梳成平滑的马尾，如同往日的模样。在一张梅西的生日派对照里，她妈妈正在挖冰淇淋，也绑了同样的马尾。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm not quiet. I'm taking a bath."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我没有很安静啊，我在洗澡。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I do it," her mom said, "because it's cheaper than perfume, but it smells just as good." Then she rubbed some vanilla behind her own ears and laughed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="妈妈说：“因为它比香水便宜，但是闻起来一样好。”她笑着在自己耳后也抹了点。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Eleanor got dressed quickly and tried to squeeze past her mother. Her mom grabbed her by the wrists. "I like to hear you sing," she said. She reached for a bottle on the counter behind Eleanor and rubbed a drop of vanilla behind each of the girl's ears. Eleanor raised her shoulders like it tickled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃莉诺迅速穿好衣服，想从妈妈身旁穿过。妈妈抓住了她的手腕：“我喜欢听你唱歌。”她把手伸到埃莉诺背后的料理台，拿起一个瓶子，往埃莉诺双耳后各抹了一滴香草油。埃莉诺耸耸肩，好像被挠痒痒一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="埃莉诺的妈妈问：“你怎么这么安静？”埃莉诺在洗澡，妈妈在煮‘十五豆方便汤’（29）。【注：（29）十五豆方便汤（Fifteen-bean soup），一种速溶的豆子汤品牌。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Eleanor really was tired, that wasn't a lie. She'd been staying up, reading, almost every night. She fell asleep that night right after dinner.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃莉诺确实很累，那不是谎话。她几乎每晚都在熬夜读漫画。今天，吃完晚饭她就睡着了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yeah…" Eleanor said, "yeah, I'm just tired. I'm going to do my homework and go to bed." Her mom seemed to know that something was off, but she didn't push. She used to make Eleanor tell her everything. "What's going on up there?" she'd say, knocking on the top of Eleanor's head. "Are you making yourself crazy?" Her mom hadn't said anything like that since Eleanor had moved home. She seemed to realize that she'd lost her right to knock.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“呃…”埃莉诺说，“还好，只是累了，我要去做作业，然后上床睡觉。”妈妈似乎察觉到有什么不对劲，却没追问。以前，她都会让埃莉诺从实招来。她会敲敲埃莉诺的脑袋说，发生什么事啦？你又把自己逼疯了？埃莉诺搬回来后，她就没再说过这样的话。她似乎明白，自己已经失去了敲埃莉诺脑袋的权利。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Eleanor climbed up onto her bunk and pushed the cat to the end. She didn't have anything to read. Nothing new, anyway. Was he done bringing her comics? Why had he even started? She ran her fingers over the embarrassing song titles -- "This Charming Man" and "How Soon Is Now?" -- on her math book. She wanted to scribble them out, but he'd probably notice and lord it over her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃莉诺爬上床，把猫推到床尾。今晚没东西可读。至少没有新的可读。他以后不再拿漫画给她了吗？那一开始他为什么要借她？她的手指滑过数学课本上那些让她丢脸的歌名——“迷人男子”（31）“现在到底要多久？”。她很想涂掉那些歌名，但是，他可能会注意到，并借此大大彰显他的优越感。【注：（31）《迷人男子》（This Charming Man），史密斯乐队的单曲。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She woke up to shouting. Richie shouting. Eleanor couldn't tell what he was saying.</div>

<div class="line_en">Eleanor could tell that everyone else in the room was already awake. She hung off the bunk until she could see the little kids take shape in the dark. All four of them were sitting together in a clump of blankets on the floor. Maisie was holding the baby, rocking him almost frantically. Eleanor slid off the bed soundlessly and huddled with them. Mouse immediately climbed into her lap. He was shaking and wet, and he wrapped his arms and legs around Eleanor like a monkey. Their mother shrieked, two rooms away, and they all five jumped together.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃莉诺知道房间里的人都醒了，她抓着床杆往下看，直到看清孩子们在黑暗中的形状。他们四个紧紧缩在地板上的毯子上。梅西疯了一样猛摇着小婴儿。埃莉诺无声地爬下床，拥抱他们。鼠鼠立刻抱住她的大腿。他在颤抖，还尿湿了裤子，像只猴子似的，用四肢紧紧抱着埃莉诺。隔着两个房间，她妈妈放声尖叫，他们五个马上跳起来，抱成一团。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Underneath the shouting, her mother was crying. She sounded like she'd been crying for a long time -- she must be completely out of her head if she was letting them hear her cry like that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吼声之下是妈妈的啜泣。听起来已经哭了很久，让孩子们听到自己这样哭，她肯定是疯了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">If this had happened two summers ago, Eleanor would have run and banged on the door herself. She would have yelled at Richie to stop. She would have called 911 at the very, very, very least. But now that seemed like something a child would do, or a fool. Now, all she could think about was what they were going to do if the baby actually started to cry. Thank God he didn't. Even he seemed to realize that trying to make this stop would only ever make it worse.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果是两年前，埃莉诺会马上过去敲他们的房门。她会大声叫雷奇住手。最起码，她会打911求救。如今，这些看来是小孩或者笨蛋才会采取的行动。现在她脑海里的唯一念头是，小婴儿如果哭了该怎么办。幸好没有。仿佛他也知道，试图阻止雷奇只会让事情更糟。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Eleanor took a deep breath. She smelled like pee. God. The cleanest clothes she had were the ones she wore yesterday, which Tina would surely point out, because it was a goddamn gym day on top of everything else.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃莉诺深深吸了口气。天哪，她浑身尿味。而仅剩的干净衣服是昨天穿过的，提娜肯定会毫不客气地指出来，因为今天有该死的体育课。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A horrible thought came to her, and she got up, stumbling over the kids and the blankets. She opened the bedroom door and smelled bacon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不祥的预感闪过脑海，她跌跌撞撞跑过地上的孩子与毯子，打开卧室门，闻到了培根的味道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Which meant that her mother was alive.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这代表妈妈还活着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When her alarm went off the next morning, Eleanor couldn't remember having fallen to sleep. She couldn't remember when the crying had stopped.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天早上闹钟响时，埃莉诺根本不记得自己睡着了。她想不起哭闹是什么时候停止的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Her mother's eyes slowly focused on her. "What?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="妈妈的眼神缓缓聚焦到她身上：“什么？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She grabbed her clothes and stepped purposely out into the living room, determined not to make eye contact with Richie if he was there. He was. (That demon. That bastard.) Her mother was standing at the stove, standing more still than usual. You couldn't not notice the bruise on the side of her face. Or the hickey under her chin. (That fuck, that fuck, that fuck.)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她抓起衣服，坚定地走进客厅。她决定，如果雷奇还在，她绝不跟他有眼神接触。他果然在。（这个魔鬼。这个混蛋。）妈妈站在炉子前，腰杆比平日更直挺。你不可能不注意到她脸上的乌青，或者下巴上的吻痕。（去死！去死！去死！）">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She washed off the top half of her body, then the bottom, so that she wouldn't ever be totally naked. Then she walked back through the living room, wearing yesterday's clothes, trying really hard not to smell like pee.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她先洗上身，再洗下半身，这样才不至于全身赤裸。她穿过客厅，穿着昨天的衣服，努力不散发出尿味。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Eleanor gestured at her clothes, which probably just looked wrinkled. "I slept on the floor with Mouse."</div>

<div class="line_en">Her mother glanced nervously into the living room; Richie would punish Mouse if he knew. "Okay, okay," she said, pushing Eleanor into the bathroom. "Give me your clothes, I'll watch the door. And don't let him smell it. I don't need this this morning."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="妈妈紧张地朝客厅望了望——如果雷奇知道了，他会惩罚鼠鼠的。她把埃莉诺推进浴室：“好啦，好啦。把衣服给我，我帮你守门。别让他闻到尿味。今早我可不想惹这个麻烦。”">查看中文翻译</div>
