<div class="line_en">Langdon's eyes crossed the courtyard to the central core of the fortress. The circular citadel shot skyward 107 feet to the bronze angel above. The balcony at the top still glowed from within. Langdon wanted to call out but knew better. He would have to find a way in.</div>

<div class="line_en">Robert Langdon dashed around the outer bulwark of the castle, grateful for the glow of the floodlights. As he circled the wall, the courtyard beneath him looked like a museum of ancient warfare -- catapults, stacks of marble cannonballs, and an arsenal of fearful contraptions. Parts of the castle were open to tourists during the day, and the courtyard had been partially restored to its original state.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dashing down the stone ramp that hugged the inside of the wall, Langdon descended to the courtyard. Back on ground level, he ran through shadows, clockwise around the fort.

He kept running.</div>

<div class="line_en">Langdon had circled almost the entire building when he saw a gravel drive cutting across the courtyard in front of him. At one end, on the outer wall of the castle, he saw the back of the gated drawbridge leading back outside. At the other end, the drive disappeared into the fortress. The drive seemed to enter a kind of tunnel -- a gaping entry in the central core. Il traforo! Langdon had read about this castle'straforo, a giant spiral ramp that circled up inside the fort, used by commanders on horseback to ride from top to bottom rapidly. The Hassassin drove up! The gate blocking the tunnel was raised, ushering Langdon in. He felt almost exuberant as he ran toward the tunnel. But as he reached the opening, his excitement disappeared.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登绕著这栋建筑几乎跑完一整圈，才看到面前有一条穿过庭院的碎石车道。其中一端通往城堡外墙上他刚刚在外面看过的那道吊桥门，另一端则通入堡垒中。那条车道似乎是某种隧道的入口──通往中央建筑。是隧道！兰登看过有关这个城堡裡隧道的资料，那是个巨大的螺旋形斜坡道，在堡内环绕而上，让骑马的军事指挥官可以迅速从堡顶来到底部。哈撒辛是开车上去的！通往隧道的门开著，迎接兰登进入。他奔向隧道口，觉得简直全身充满活力。但一来到门边，满腹的兴奋却消失无踪。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Hassassin knew he deserved this woman. He had served Janus well. She was a spoil of war, and when he was finished with her, he would pull her from the divan and force her to her knees. She would service him again. The ultimate submission. Then, at the moment of his own climax, he would slit her throat.</div>

<div class="line_en">After one complete turn into the earth, the light was all but gone. The tunnel leveled out, and Langdon slowed, sensing by the echo of his footfalls that he had just entered a larger chamber. Before him in the murkiness, he thought he saw glimmers of light… fuzzy reflections in the ambient gleam. He moved forward, reaching out his hand. He found smooth surfaces. Chrome and glass. It was a vehicle. He groped the surface, found a door, and opened it.</div>

<div class="line_en">The vehicle's interior dome-light flashed on. He stepped back and recognized the black van immediately. Feeling a surge of loathing, he stared a moment, then he dove in, rooting around in hopes of finding a weapon to replace the one he'd lost in the fountain. He found none. He did, however, find Vittoria's cell phone. It was shattered and useless. The sight of it filled Langdon with fear. He prayed he was not too late.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="车内的圆顶灯亮起。他往后退，立刻认出了这辆黑色厢型车。他胸中涌起一股强烈的憎恨，瞪了一会儿，然后上了车，到处翻寻著，希望能找个武器，代替他掉在喷泉内的那把枪。结果什麼都没发现，不过却看到了薇多利雅的手机，已经摔坏不能用了。手机那副样子让兰登很害怕，祈祷自己还不会太迟。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At the end of his rope, Langdon jumped from the van and scanned the walls around him. No doorways. No gates. He thought of the angel over the tunnel entrance and wondered if it had been a coincidence. No! He thought of the killer's words at the fountain. She is in the Church of Illumination… awaiting my return. Langdon had come too far to fail now. His heart was pounding. Frustration and hatred were starting to cripple his senses.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无计可施之餘，兰登跳下车，扫视著周围的墙面。没有门，没有其他通道。他想著隧道入口上方的那个天使，纳闷那会不会只是个巧合。不可能！他想著杀手在喷泉那边说过的话。她在光明教堂……等著我回去。兰登已经一路追得这麼远，不能在这个时候认输。他的心臟跳得好厉害，挫折和憎恨开始淹没他的感官。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He reached up and turned on the van's headlights. The room around him blazed into existence, harsh shadows in a simple chamber. Langdon guessed the room was once used for horses and ammunition. It was also a dead end.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他伸手打开了厢型车的车前大灯。整个房间现出形体，刺目的光照著简朴的石室，投下一道道反差强烈的影子。兰登猜想这个房间一度用来当马厂和弹药库，没有其他的出口。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When he saw the blood on the floor, Langdon's first thought was for Vittoria. But as his eyes followed the stains, he realized they were bloody footprints. The strides were long. The splotches of blood were only on the left foot. The Hassassin!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看到地板上的血跡时，兰登一开始以為是薇多利雅的。但他一路追踪著血跡，才明白那是流血的脚印。步伐很大，只有左脚沾著血。是哈撒辛！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Langdon followed the footprints toward the corner of the room, his sprawling shadow growing fainter. He felt more and more puzzled with every step. The bloody prints looked as though they walked directly into the corner of the room and then disappeared.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登循著那些脚印走到房间的角落，他拉长的影子变淡了。随著每一步，他觉得愈来愈困惑。那些血脚印看起来好像直直走进房间一角，然后就消失了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When Langdon arrived in the corner, he could not believe his eyes. The granite block in the floor here was not a square like the others. He was looking at another signpost. The block was carved into a perfect pentagram, arranged with the tip pointing into the corner. Ingeniously concealed by overlapping walls, a narrow slit in the stone served as an exit. Langdon slid through. He was in a passage. In front of him were the remains of a wooden barrier that had once been blocking this tunnel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登来到角落，简直不敢相信自己的眼睛。地板上的那块花岗岩石砖不像其他地方是正方形的。他正看著另外一块路标。那块石砖是正五边形，尖端朝向角落。两面石墙一前一后部份重叠，中间精巧地隐藏著一道窄缝，成了一个出口。兰登溜进去，置身於一条廊道中。他前方是一道残破不堪的木板门，以前用来挡在隧道前的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="是监狱。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Near the cell was an iron doorway in the wall. The door was ajar and beyond it Langdon could see some sort of passage. He ran toward it. But Langdon stopped before he got there. The trail of blood did not enter the passage. When Langdon saw the words carved over the archway, he knew why.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那个牢房旁边的墙上有一道铁门。门半开著，兰登看得见门外是个廊道。他跑向门，跑到一半停下脚步，地上的血跡并没有通到廊道去。直到兰登看到拱门上刻的字，才明白為什麼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Langdon was running now. He clambered over the wood and headed for the light. The passage quickly opened into another, larger chamber. Here a single torch flickered on the wall. Langdon was in a section of the castle that had no electricity… a section no tourists would ever see. The room would have been frightful in daylight, but the torch made it even more gruesome.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登跑了起来，他爬过木门，朝灯光奔去。没多久来到另一个比较大的石室。墙上只有一把火炬，火光摇曳不定。兰登位於这个城堡内没有电力的区域……没有游客见过的区域。这个房间若在白天也够恐怖了，但现在那把火炬却造成更阴森的效果。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There were a dozen tiny jail cells, the iron bars on most eroded away. One of the larger cells, however, remained intact, and on the floor Langdon saw something that almost stopped his heart. Black robes and red sashes on the floor. This is where he held the cardinals!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这裡有十来个小囚室，大部分的铁栅条都銹烂了。不过其中一个比较大的牢房，栅条仍完整无缺，兰登看到牢房内地板上的东西，差点连心跳都停了。那是几件黑色长袍和红色腰繫带。那些枢机主教就是被他关在这裡！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Il Passetto.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="上头用义大利文刻著「小廊道」。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was stunned. He had heard of this tunnel many times, never knowing where exactly the entrance was. Il Passetto -- The Little Passage -- was a slender, three-quarter-mile tunnel built between Castle St. Angelo and the Vatican. It had been used by various Popes to escape to safety during sieges of the Vatican… as well as by a few less pious Popes to secretly visit mistresses or oversee the torture of their enemies. Nowadays both ends of the tunnel were supposedly sealed with impenetrable locks whose keys were kept in some Vatican vault. Langdon suddenly feared he knew how the Illuminati had been moving in and out of the Vatican. He found himself wonderingwho on the inside had betrayed the church and coughed up the keys. Olivetti? One of the Swiss Guard? None of it mattered anymore.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登当场愣住了。他听说过这个隧道很多次了，却从不晓得入口到底在哪裡。小廊道是一条四分之三哩的狭长隧道，从圣天使堡通到梵蒂冈。好几位教宗曾在梵蒂冈被围城时，利用这条隧道安全逃出……还有几位不怎麼虔诚的教宗用来跟自己的情妇幽会，或是去监督手下拷打敌人。现在隧道的两端应该都是用锁封上，钥匙保存在梵蒂冈的某个保险库裡。兰登忽然担心自己已经知道光明会如何进出梵蒂冈了。他不禁纳闷，梵蒂冈内部会是谁背叛了教会，把钥匙弄了出来。欧里维提吗？还是哪个瑞士卫兵？但现在已经不重要了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Before ascending, Langdon knew he needed a weapon, any weapon. He found a four-foot section of iron bar near one of the cells. It had a sharp, splintered end. Although absurdly heavy, it was the best he could do. He hoped the element of surprise, combined with the Hassassin's wound, would be enough to tip the scales in his advantage. Most of all, though, he hoped he was not too late.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爬上阶梯之前，兰登知道自己需要武器，什麼都行。他在一个牢房边发现了一根四迟长的铁棒，其中一头是锋利的断裂边。虽然重得不得了，但却是他能找到的最佳武器了。他希望利用出其不意的因素，加上那个哈撒辛的脚伤，能足以扭转大局，让情势转而对自己有利。但最重要的，他希望自己不会来得太晚。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The blood on the floor led to the opposite end of the prison. Langdon followed. Here, a rusty gate hung draped with chains. The lock had been removed and the gate stood ajar. Beyond the gate was a steep ascension of spiral stairs. The floor here was also marked with a pentagramal block. Langdon stared at the block, trembling, wondering if Bernini himself had held the chisel that had shaped these chunks. Overhead, the archway was adorned with a tiny carved cherub. This was it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="地板上的血通到监狱的另一端，兰登一路循血跡走过去。这裡有一道銹跡斑斑的门垂掛著铁鍊。锁已经拿掉了，门半掩著。门外是一道陡峭上升的螺旋阶梯。这裡的地板上也有一块五边形石砖。兰登望著那块石砖，颤抖著，很好奇这块石砖是不是贝尼尼本人拿著凿子给凿成的。拱门上方装饰著一尊小小的智品天使雕像。就是这条路没错了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The trail of blood curved up the stairs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="血跡转上了楼梯。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The staircase's spiral treads were worn and twisted steeply upward. Langdon ascended, listening for sounds. None. As he climbed, the light from the prison area faded away. He ascended into the total darkness, keeping one hand on the wall. Higher. In the blackness, Langdon sensed the ghost of Galileo, climbing these very stairs, eager to share his visions of heaven with other men of science and faith.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="螺旋阶梯的梯级很破旧，又弯陡得厉害。兰登上了楼梯，倾听著动静。什麼都没有。他往上爬，监狱区的灯光逐渐淡去。爬到某个高度后，周围完全暗下来，他伸手扶著墙，愈爬愈高。在那片黑暗中，兰登感觉到伽利略的鬼魂也正爬著这道阶梯，急著要和其他科学和虔诚之士分享他对天空的观点。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As the stairs began narrowing, Langdon felt the passage closing around him. The shadows of history were whispering in the dark, but he moved on. When he saw the horizontal shaft of light before him, he realized he was standing a few steps beneath a landing, where the glow of torchlight spilled out beneath the threshold of a door in front of him. Silently he moved up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="楼梯开始变窄，兰登感觉到通道两侧紧紧包围著他。歷史的阴影在黑暗中悄悄低语，但他继续前进。当他看到前方那道水平的光束，知道自己距离顶端的楼梯间只剩几阶了，火炬的光芒从门底下的缝隙透出来，他无声往上爬。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Langdon was still in a state of shock over the location of the lair. The Illuminati meeting hall was in a building owned by the Vatican. No doubt while the Vatican guards were out searching basements and homes of well-known scientists, the Illuminati were meetinghere… right under the Vatican's nose. It suddenly seemed so perfect. Bernini, as head architect of renovations here, would have had unlimited access to this structure… remodeling it to his own specifications with no questions asked.

But time had run out. The beast had returned. Now he was standing over her, his chest bare and powerful, scarred from battles he had endured.
