<div class="line_en">So I was at a loss when I mashed the button on the keyless remote, and it was not his Volvo that beeped and flashed its lights for me. It was another car -- a standout even in the long line of vehicles that were mostly all drool-worthy in their own ways.</div>

I just threw myself into the silky leather seat and cranked the engine while my knees were still crunched up under the steering wheel.

<div class="line_en">In a sick way, it was my lucky day. If by lucky you meant taking a well-traveled highway at two hundred without so much as seeing one cop, even in the thirty-mile-an -- hour speed-trap towns. What a letdown. A little chase action might have been nice, not to mention that the license plate info would bring the heat down on the leech. Sure, he'd buy his way out of it, but it might have been just a little inconvenient for him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="病态的理解，今天也是我的幸运日。所谓的幸运就是在限速每小时30里的小镇里，你可以在公路上以200码的速度纵横驰骋而见不到一个警察。这多么令人扫兴啊。一场小小的追逐赛也是不错的选择，反正牌照上的信息都是那些吸血鬼的。当然，他可以用钱搞定一切，但是这多少能给他造成一些小小的麻烦。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The only sign of surveillance I came across was just a hint of dark brown fur flitting through the woods, running parallel to me for a few miles on the south side of Forks.

Again, I almost wondered what his story would be before I remembered that I didn't care.</div>

<div class="line_en">I walked around for what felt like hours. Long enough that the sun changed sides in the sky. I stared into the face of every girl who passed anywhere near me, making myself really look, noticing who was pretty and who had blue eyes and who looked good in braces and who had way too much makeup on. I tried to find something interesting about each face, so that I would know for sure that I'd really tried. Things like: This one had a really straight nose; that one should pull her hair out of her eyes; this one could do lipstick ads if the rest of her face was as perfect as her mouth…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我大约走了将近一个小时，差不多连太阳在天空中都变换了角度。我盯着每个和我擦身而过的女孩的脸，使劲地瞧着，看着谁漂亮，谁有一双蓝眼睛，谁的胸比较大，谁的妆又太厚了。我试着从每个人的脸上都发掘出一些有趣的地方，这样我就可以说服自己我是真的试过了。比如：这个人的鼻子真挺；那个人的发型如果把眼睛露出来就好一点；这个人如果五官都能长得像她的嘴唇那么好就能去做唇膏广告了……">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sometimes they stared back. Sometimes they looked scared -- like they were thinking, Who is this big freak glaring at me? Sometimes I thought they looked kind of interested, but maybe that was just my ego running wild.</div>

I hadn't noticed till now -- it was a nice day. Sun and all that. People were out celebrating the blue sky.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我继续向北走，人口越来越稠密。终于，我找到了一个热闹的公园，小孩、家人、滑板、单车、风筝、野餐，集齐了所有的要素。直到现在我才注意到——今天真是个好天气啊。阳光明媚，人们都外出踏青庆祝蓝天白云。">查看中文翻译</div>
