<div class="line_en">A long time before I was born, my Grandma and Grandpa moved into the house on Beechwood Avenue. They had a young family -- of 4 little girls. The little girls slept in the attic in a big feather bed. It was cold there on winter night. Grandma put hot bricks under the covers at the foot of the bed to keep the little girls warm.</div>

<div class="line_en">The house on Beechwood Avenue had a big front yard with shade trees and fruit trees. In the middle of the yard was a water pump where the four little girls pumped water for cooking, cleaning and watering the garden. On one side of the yard, Grandma and Grandpa planted tomatoes, beans, squash, cucumbers, peppers and strawberries to feed their growing family. They planted roses geraniums lilacs and irises on the other side of the yard, around the statue of the Blessed Mother.</div>

<div class="line_en">One sunny day in the early summer, Grandma heard a commotion in the front yard and looked out the window to see a frightening sight a gigantic swarm of bees filled the air between two tall trees. There were thousands of bees in the air, so many that the swarm reached the tree-tops! The buzzing sound was tremendous. Grandma watched as the bees made their way into a hole up in one of the trees. Before long, everyone of those bees had disappeared into its new home.</div>

<div class="line_en">During the next few days, the bees were busy making their own business. Grandma could always see a few bees buzzing in and out around the opening high in the tree.
