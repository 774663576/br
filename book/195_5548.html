<div class="line_en">He saw her then every day. He began going to lunch at the shop, but Mildred stopped him: she said it made the girls talk; so he had to content himself with tea; but he always waited about to walk with her to the station; and once or twice a week they dined together. He gave her little presents, a gold bangle, gloves, handkerchiefs, and the like. He was spending more than he could afford, but he could not help it: it was only when he gave her anything that she showed any affection. She knew the price of everything, and her gratitude was in exact proportion with the value of his gift. He did not care. He was too happy when she volunteered to kiss him to mind by what means he got her demonstrativeness. He discovered that she found Sundays at home tedious, so he went down to Herne Hill in the morning, met her at the end of the road, and went to church with her.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then she went back to dinner, he got a scrappy meal at a hotel, and in the afternoon they took a walk in Brockwell Park. They had nothing much to say to one another, and Philip, desperately afraid she was bored (she was very easily bored), racked his brain for topics of conversation. He realised that these walks amused neither of them, but he could not bear to leave her, and did all he could to lengthen them till she became tired and out of temper. He knew that she did not care for him, and he tried to force a love which his reason told him was not in her nature: she was cold. He had no claim on her, but he could not help being exacting. Now that they were more intimate he found it less easy to control his temper; he was often irritable and could not help saying bitter things. Often they quarrelled, and she would not speak to him for a while; but this always reduced him to subjection, and he crawled before her. He was angry with himself for showing so little dignity. He grew furiously jealous if he saw her speaking to any other man in the shop, and when he was jealous he seemed to be beside himself. He would deliberately insult her, leave the shop and spend afterwards a sleepless night tossing on his bed, by turns angry and remorseful. Next day he would go to the shop and appeal for forgiveness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从教堂出来后她回家吃饭，菲利普就找家旅馆糊弄两口，下午再陪她去布洛威公园散步。他们之间没什么好聊的，可菲利普提心吊胆不敢让她觉得无聊（她很容易就无聊了），千方百计想找些能谈的话题。他发现这样散步对两个人来说都没什么意思，可又不愿意离开她，只能尽量多走一会儿，直到她走不动了，或者发起脾气来。他知道她不喜欢自己，却还是想尽一切办法从她那得到些事实上并不存在的爱意。她依然冷若冰霜。而他即便没有权利要求她什么，总还是忍不住埋怨她的冷漠。随着两个人关系越来越亲密，他发现自己已经不太能憋住肚子里的火气了，动不动就被激怒，说些尖酸刻薄的话。他们常常吵架，每次吵完她就要晾他一阵。总是他先忍不住低头，跑到她跟前忍气吞声赔不是。他快要被自己气死了，怎么能这样不要脸面！看到她和别的男人说话，醋意也越来越浓。只要一吃醋，他就不是他了，每次都发疯一样地跑到她面前大骂一通，气冲冲地离去，再在床上辗转反侧一整夜，时而气得发癫，时而悔得心疼。第二天再跑到店里，可怜兮兮地求她原谅。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He suspected that her refusal was due only to a disinclination to let him see her aunt. Mildred had represented her as the widow of a professional man (that was her formula of distinction), and was uneasily conscious that the good woman could hardly be called distinguished. Philip imagined that she was in point of fact the widow of a small tradesman. He knew that Mildred was a snob. But he found no means by which he could indicate to her that he did not mind how common the aunt was.</div>

He was in the habit of condoning her cruelty by the thought of her stupidity. She had not the brains to see when she was wounding him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="米尔德里德兴高采烈地说起今晚的约会。菲利普不知道她这样做是有意要伤他一把，还是因为她这个人太麻木迟钝。他总是习惯将她的残忍无情归咎于她的愚蠢，所以一而再再而三地选择原谅。她只是没有心眼，意识不到正在伤害他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's not much fun to be in love with a girl who has no imagination and no sense of humour," he thought, as he listened.</div>

<div class="line_en">But the want of these things excused her. He felt that if he had not realised this he could never forgive her for the pain she caused him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="也正是因为她不具备这些特质，所以才能一次次被原谅。菲利普觉得要是自己没有意识到这点，可能就无法原谅她给自己带来的痛苦了吧。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"He's a gentleman in every sense of the word," thought Philip, but he clenched his teeth to prevent himself from uttering a syllable.</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip went to the Tivoli and saw Mildred with her companion, a smooth-faced young man with sleek hair and the spruce look of a commercial traveller, sitting in the second row of the stalls. Mildred wore a black picture hat with ostrich feathers in it, which became her well. She was listening to her host with that quiet smile which Philip knew; she had no vivacity of expression, and it required broad farce to excite her laughter; but Philip could see that she was interested and amused. He thought to himself bitterly that her companion, flashy and jovial, exactly suited her. Her sluggish temperament made her appreciate noisy people. Philip had a passion for discussion, but no talent for small-talk. He admired the easy drollery of which some of his friends were masters, Lawson for instance, and his sense of inferiority made him shy and awkward. The things which interested him bored Mildred. She expected men to talk about football and racing, and he knew nothing of either. He did not know the catchwords which only need be said to excite a laugh.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他去了蒂沃利，看见米尔德里德和她的同伴儿也在那里。那个男人脸蛋刮得干干净净，头发梳得油光水滑，衣服穿得人模人样，像个东奔西跑的推销员。他们坐在正厅的第二排座位。米尔德里德戴了顶黑色宽边帽，还插了根鸵鸟羽毛在上面。她戴这种帽子很好看。男人正在说话，她在一边听着，脸上挂着浅浅的笑容。这个笑容菲利普很熟悉，她通常没有太多表情，想要看她一笑非要讲些恶俗的笑话不可。可菲利普能看出来，她现在分明非常快活。身边那个仪表堂堂、生性快活的小伙子配她刚刚合适，菲利普心里酸溜溜的。她本身不太爱动弹，所以更喜欢开朗活泼的人。菲利普很适合与人交谈议论，但少了些扯闲话的本领。他的朋友里有几个特别擅长穷聊打趣，比如劳森，他特别喜欢他们讲的那些小笑话。可他总觉得自己处处不如人，所以一味拘谨害羞，畏首畏脚。他感兴趣的事对米尔德里德而言都没滋没味的。米尔德里德觉得男人就该讨论足球和赛马，可菲利普对体育一窍不通。他也不知道到底有什么话能逗米尔德里德一笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
