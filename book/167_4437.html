<div class="line_en">The ancient crown of the Kings of Winter had been lost three centuries ago, yielded up to Aegon the Conqueror when Torrhen Stark knelt in submission. What Aegon had done with it no man could say. Lord Hoster's smith had done his work well, and Robb's crown looked much as the other was said to have looked in the tales told of the Stark kings of old; an open circlet of hammered bronze incised with the runes of the First Men, surmounted by nine black iron spikes wrought in the shape of longswords. Of gold and silver and gemstones, it had none; bronze and iron were the metals of winter, dark and strong to fight against the cold.</div>

<div class="line_en">As they waited in Riverrun's Great Hall for the prisoner to be brought before them, she saw Robb push back the crown so it rested upon the thick auburn mop of his hair; moments later, he moved it forward again; later he gave it a quarter turn, as if that might make it sit more easily on his brow. It is no easy thing to wear a crown, Catelyn thought, watching, especially for a boy of fifteen years.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们在奔流城的大厅里静待囚犯。她见罗柏把王冠往后推，安放在蓬厚的棕发上。没过多久，他又往前拉，接着转了转，好像这能让他戴得更舒服。戴王冠不是件容易事啊，凯特琳边看边想，对一个年仅十五的孩子而言，尤其如此。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When the guards brought in the captive, Robb called for his sword. Olyvar Frey offered it up hilt first, and her son drew the blade and laid it bare across his knees, a threat plain for all to see. "Your Grace, here is the man you asked for," announced Ser Robin Ryger, captain of the Tully household guard.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等犯人带入，罗柏便命取剑。奥利法·佛雷剑柄在前，递了上去，儿子抽出宝剑，横放于膝，威压的意图非常明显。“陛下，这就是您要的人。”徒利家的侍卫队长罗宾·莱格爵士高声宣布。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Rise, Ser Cleos." Her son's voice was not as icy as his father's would have been, but he did not sound a boy of fifteen either. War had made a man of him before his time. Morning light glimmered faintly against the edge of the steel across his knees.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“克里奥爵士，起来吧。”儿子的声音虽不若乃父那么冰冷，却也不像十五岁的孩子。是战争，迫使他提早成年。横放膝上的那把剑映着晨光，刃缘微微闪亮。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Kneel before the king, Lannister!" Theon Greyjoy shouted. Ser Robin forced the prisoner to his knees.</div>

<div class="line_en">He did not look a lion, Catelyn reflected. This Ser Cleos Frey was a son of the Lady Genna who was sister to Lord Tywin Lannister, but he had none of the fabled Lannister beauty, the fair hair and green eyes. Instead he had inherited the stringy brown locks, weak chin, and thin face of his sire, Ser Emmon Frey, old Lord Walder's second son. His eyes were pale and watery and he could not seem to stop blinking, but perhaps that was only the light. The cells below Riverrun were dark and damp… and these days crowded as well.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他丝毫没有狮子的模样，凯特琳暗忖。这位克里奥·佛雷爵士的母亲是泰温·兰尼斯特的妹妹吉娜夫人，但他半分都没遗传兰尼斯特家著名的美貌和金发碧眼，他反而继承了父亲艾蒙·佛雷爵士——瓦德·佛雷老侯爵的次子——的体征，生得一头纤细棕发，下巴短小，脸形削瘦，一双眼睛苍白无色，水汪汪的，还眨个不停。或许这是光线的关系吧，奔流城下的地牢阴暗潮湿…近来又格外拥挤。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Yet it was not the sword that made Ser Cleos Frey anxious; it was the beast. Grey Wind, her son had named him. A direwolf large as any elkhound, lean and smoke-dark, with eyes like molten gold. When the beast padded forward and sniffed at the captive knight, every man in that hall could smell the scent of fear. Ser Cleos had been taken during the battle in the Whispering Wood, where Grey Wind had ripped out the throats of half a dozen men.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而使克里奥·佛雷爵士焦虑的并非宝剑，而是那头冰原狼。儿子将它取名为“灰风”，它的身躯大如猎鹿犬，身无赘肉，毛色烟黑，眼瞳宛若熔金。他缓步向前，踱到被俘的骑士身边嗅了嗅。大厅里的所有人都能闻到恐惧的气息。克里奥爵士是在呓语森林一役中被俘，是役灰风共咬断了五六个敌兵的咽喉。">查看中文翻译</div>

He had been the first to proclaim her son King in the North, and he would brook no slight to the honor of his new-made sovereign.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“‘陛下’！”外号“大琼恩”的安柏伯爵怒叱。在罗柏的北方诸将中，属他嗓门最大…也最为忠诚勇猛，至少他自己这么坚持。他是尊儿子为北境之王的第一人，自然容不下任何对自己新王的不敬之举。">查看中文翻译</div>

Many of your cousins and uncles rode with us in the Whispering Wood, but you chose to fight beneath the lion banner. That makes you a Lannister, not a Frey. I want your pledge, on your honor as a knight, that after you deliver my message you'll return with the queen's reply, and resume your captivity."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但你要知道，”罗柏说，“我可没放你自由。你的祖父瓦德大人率领佛雷全族上下归顺于我，你的堂兄弟和叔舅们更在呓语森林之战中英勇奋斗，可你却选择为狮子旗而战。既然如此，你就是兰尼斯特家的人，而非佛雷。我要你以骑士之名誉立誓，一旦将信送达，不日即携带太后的答覆返回此地，继续作俘虏。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Tytos Blackwood's swept the Lannisters off his lands, but they took every cow and pig and speck of grain and left him nothing to defend but Raventree Hall and a scorched desert. Darry men recaptured their lord's keep but held it less than a fortnight before Gregor Clegane descended on them and put the whole garrison to the sword, even their lord."</div>

<div class="line_en">"True enough," Ser Brynden admitted. "And Tywin Lannister is no man's fool. He sits safe behind the walls of Harrenhal, feeding his host on our harvest and burning what he does not take. Gregor is not the only dog he's loosed. Ser Amory Lorch is in the field as well, and some sellsword out of Qohor who'd sooner maim a man than kill him. I've seen what they leave behind them. Whole villages put to the torch, women raped and mutilated, butchered children left unburied to draw wolves and wild dogs… it would sicken even the dead."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“很正确，”布林登爵士同意，“泰温·兰尼斯特精明着呢，他安稳地守在赫伦堡重重高墙后，拿咱们的粮食喂他的兵丁，拿不走的就烧掉。他放出的走狗不只格雷果一条，亚摩利·洛奇爵士也出马了，此外还有群科霍尔佣兵，这帮家伙性情残忍，爱把人弄成残废。我见过他们留下的景观：全村焚毁，妇女被奸淫后支解，遭屠杀的孩子暴尸荒野，不得埋葬，任由狼群和野狗竞食…这种场面连死人都受不了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Aye, and the last of his line as well. The boy would have brought a fine ransom, but what does gold mean to a frothing dog like Gregor Clegane? That beast's head would make a noble gift for all the people of the realm, I vow."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊，而且是戴瑞家最后的传人。用那孩子原本可换一笔高额赎金，可对格雷果·克里冈这种疯狗来说，黄金有什么用呢？我发誓，这个畜生的头是献给全国百姓最好的礼物。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Catelyn knew Ser Gregor's evil reputation, yet still… "Don't speak to me of heads, Uncle. Cersei has mounted Ned's on a spike above the walls of the Red Keep, and left it for the crows and flies." Even now, it was hard for her to believe that he was truly gone. Some nights she would wake in darkness, half-asleep, and for an instant expect to find him there beside her. "Clegane is no more than Lord Tywin's catspaw." For Tywin Lannister -- Lord of Casterly Rock, Warden of the West, father to Queen Cersei, Ser Jaime the Kingslayer, and Tyrion the Imp, and grandfather to Joffrey Baratheon, the new-crowned boy king -- was the true danger, Catelyn believed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯特琳知道克里冈爵士恶名昭彰，但这未免也太…“叔叔，不要提起头。瑟曦把奈德的头挑在枪尖，挂在红堡墙上，任由乌鸦和苍蝇糟蹋。”到了现在，她还是很难相信他就这么走了。有时她夜里醒来，半梦半醒之间，恍惚以为他就在身旁。“克里冈不过是泰温大人的走狗罢了。”泰温·兰尼斯特——凯岩城公爵、西境守护，瑟曦太后、“弑君者”詹姆爵士和“小恶魔”提利昂的父亲，新登基的幼王乔佛里·拜拉席恩的祖父——才是真正的乱源，凯特琳坚信。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Brynden Blackfish arched a bushy grey eyebrow. "More fool they. My first rule of war, Cat -- never give the enemy his wish. Lord Tywin would like to fight on a field of his own choosing. He wants us to march on Harrenhal."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黑鱼布林登皱起他的灰色浓眉，“这正是他们愚昧之处。我作战的首要原则，凯特——是绝不让对方称心如意。泰温大人巴不得在他选择的地点与我们决战，他希望我们朝赫伦堡进军。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Harrenhal." Every child of the Trident knew the tales told of Harrenhal, the vast fortress that King Harren the Black had raised beside the waters of Gods Eye three hundred years past, when the Seven Kingdoms had been seven kingdoms, and the riverlands were ruled by the ironmen from the islands. In his pride, Harren had desired the highest hall and tallest towers in all Westeros. Forty years it had taken, rising like a great shadow on the shore of the lake while Harren's armies plundered his neighbors for stone, lumber, gold, and workers. Thousands of captives died in his quarries, chained to his sledges, or laboring on his five colossal towers. Men froze by winter and sweltered in summer. Weirwoods that had stood three thousand years were cut down for beams and rafters. Harren had beggared the riverlands and the Iron Islands alike to ornament his dream. And when at last Harrenhal stood complete, on the very day King Harren took up residence, Aegon the Conqueror had come ashore at King's Landing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“赫伦堡。”三河流域的每位孩童都听过赫伦堡的故事。这是三百年前由“黑心”赫伦王在神眼湖边建造的巨大堡垒。那个时代，七国境内真是七国分立，而河间地区由铁群岛的“铁民”所统治。骄傲的赫伦想拥有全维斯特洛最大的殿堂和最高的塔楼，所以他前后耗费四十年修建此城。巨大的阴影在湖边不断拔高，赫伦王的军队则四处劫掠，从邻国抢来石头、木材、黄金和工人。在采石场中，在拖木橇上，在修建那五座巨人般的高塔时，成千上万的奴工力竭而死。人们冬天挨饿受冻，夏天汗流浃背，风风雨雨，劳作不息。为筹备足够的梁柱和椽木，生长三千年的鱼梁木横遭砍伐，赫伦竭尽河间全境和铁群岛的一切资源，只为达成一己迷梦。最后赫伦堡终告竣工，然而就在赫伦王进驻城中的当日，征服者伊耿也率军登陆君临。">查看中文翻译</div>
