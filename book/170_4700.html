<div class="line_en">A steady drip-drip-drip punctuated his words, as snowmelt ran off his cloak to puddle on the floor. The snow had been falling on King's Landing most of the night; outside the drifts were ankle deep. Ser Kevan Lannister pulled his cloak about himself more closely. "So you say, ser. Words are wind."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Then let me prove the truth of them with my sword." The light of the torches made a fiery blaze of Ronnet Connington's long red hair and beard. "Send me against my uncle, and I will bring you back his head, and the head of this false dragon too."</div>

<div class="line_en">Lannister spearmen in crimson cloaks and lion-crested halfhelms stood along the west wall of the throne room. Tyrell guards in green cloaks faced them from the opposite wall. The chill in the throne room was palpable. Though neither Queen Cersei nor Queen Margaery was amongst them, their presence could be felt poisoning the air, like ghosts at a feast.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="身披深红色色斗篷头戴狮首形半盔的兰尼斯特枪兵站在王座室的西墙边，穿着绿色斗篷的提利尔护卫则面对着他们站在对面的墙下。王座室中的寒冷显而易见，虽然瑟熙太后和玛格丽王后并不在列，但仍能感到他们的存在毒害着空气，如同鬼魂光临盛宴。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Behind the table where the five members of the king's small council were seated, the Iron Throne crouched like some great black beast, its barbs and claws and blades half-shrouded in shadow. Kevan Lannister could feel it at his back, an itch between the shoulder blades. It was easy to imagine old King Aerys perched up there, bleeding from some fresh cut, glowering down. But today the throne was empty. He had seen no reason for Tommen to join them. Kinder to let the boy remain with his mother. The Seven only knew how long mother and son might have together before Cersei's trial… and possibly her execution.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在国王那小议会的五名成员座位的桌后，铁王座像一头庞大的黑色猛兽蹲踞着，它的倒钩爪子和刀片都隐匿在阴影里。凯冯·兰尼斯特能感受到背后的它，肩部的刀刃间有一点儿痒。很容易就能想象年迈的疯王伊利斯端坐在上面怒目扫视下面的景象，他新鲜的割伤还在流血。但是今日的王座空空如也。他给不出让托曼加入他们的理由。还是让男孩和他的妈妈待在一起比较好。七神只知道在瑟熙的审判之前母子还有多少团聚的时间…而审判可能意味着处决。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ser Kevan took no issue with that. "Escort Ser Ronnet back to his chambers," he said. And see that he remains there went unspoken.

<div class="line_en">As the echoes of Connington's footsteps faded away, Grand Maester Pycelle gave a ponderous shake of his head. "His uncle once stood just where the boy was standing now and told King Aerys how he would deliver him the head of Robert Baratheon."</div>

<div class="line_en">The more I give him, the more he wants. Kevan Lannister was beginning to understand why Cersei had grown so resentful of the Tyrells. But this was not the moment to provoke an open quarrel. Randyll Tarly and Mace Tyrell had both brought armies to King's Landing, whilst the best part of the strength of House Lannister remained in the riverlands, fast melting away. "The Mountain's men were always fighters," he said in a conciliatory tone, "and we may have need of every sword against these sellswords. If this truly is the Golden Company, as Qyburn's whisperers insist --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我给的越多，他索求的也越多。凯冯·兰尼斯特开始理解瑟熙对提利尔家的人如此愤恨的原因了。但这还不是在台面上激化矛盾的时候。蓝道·塔利和梅斯·提利尔都带兵来到君临，而兰尼斯特家族的力量依旧留在河间地正快速瓦解。“魔山的旧部总归来说都还都战斗力颇高，”他试图用调解性的语调缓和，“我们可能需要每柄可用之剑去对抗这些雇佣剑士。若他们真的是黄金团的话，就像科本的告密者坚称的——”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Twenty," said Lord Randyll Tarly, "and most of them Gregor Clegane's old lot. Your nephew Jaime gave them to Connington. To rid himself of them, I'd wager. They had not been in Maidenpool a day before one killed a man and another was accused of rape. I had to hang the one and geld the other.

<div class="line_en">"A dog takes after its master," declared Mace Tyrell. "Black cloaks would suit them, I agree. I will not suffer such men in the city watch." A hundred of his own Highgarden men had been added to the gold cloaks, yet plainly his lordship meant to resist any balancing infusion of westermen.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ser Kevan wished that he could share his certainty. He had known Jon Connington, slightly -- a proud youth, the most headstrong of the gaggle of young lordlings who had gathered around Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, competing for his royal favor. Arrogant, but able and energetic. That, and his skill at arms, was why Mad King Aerys had named him Hand. Old Lord Merryweather's inaction had allowed the rebellion to take root and spread, and Aerys wanted someone young and vigorous to match Robert's own youth and vigor. "Too soon," Lord Tywin Lannister had declared when word of the king's choice had reached Casterly Rock. "Connington is too young, too bold, too eager for glory."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯冯爵士希望也能像他那么确定，他以前认识琼恩·康宁顿，但仅是一点儿——一个骄傲的年轻人，聚集在雷加王子身边的那伙为皇室恩宠争得头破血流的人里最顽固的家伙。他傲慢自大，但是同时活泼而才华四射。因为这点还有他对于武艺的熟练技艺让疯王伊利斯任命他为国王之手。年迈的领主梅里韦瑟的无所作为播下了叛乱的种子并人气生根发芽，而伊利斯则需要某个年轻力壮的人与劳伯自己的青春与气度相匹敌。“太早了，”泰温·兰尼斯特公爵在国王的决策的消息到达凯岩城时说。“康宁顿太年轻，太鲁莽也太渴望荣誉。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"If it is him," Lord Randyll said. "… as for Connington," Tyrell repeated, "what victories has he ever won that we should fear him? He could have ended Robert's Rebellion at Stoney Sept. He failed. Just as the Golden Company has always failed. Some may rush to join them, aye. The realm is well rid of such fools."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“若那时他的话，”蓝道伯爵说。“至于康宁顿，”提利尔重复道，“他赢得过哪种胜利会让我们怕他？他本可在石堂镇镇压劳伯的叛乱，但是他失败了，就像黄金团一直的失败一样。没错，有些人会赶去他的阵营，王国境内可不乏这类白痴。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Battle of the Bells had proved the truth of that. Ser Kevan had expected that afterward Aerys would have no choice but to summon Tywin once more… but the Mad King had turned to the Lords Chelsted and Rossart instead, and paid for it with life and crown. That was all so long ago, though. If this is indeed Jon Connington, he will be a different man. Older, harder, more seasoned… more dangerous. "Connington may have more than the Golden Company. It is said he has a Targaryen pretender."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="钟鸣战役证实了泰温的预测。凯冯还希望在伊利斯别无选择后会再一次传唤泰温…但是疯王却向切尔斯泰德和罗萨特的领主们求助，最后付出了性命和王座的代价。但那是很久之前的事了，若这个人真的是琼恩·康宁顿，他一定成了个不同的人。更年长，坚毅，身经百战…也更危险。“康宁顿有的可能不止黄金团。据说他身边有着个假称坦格里安的冒牌货。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Kevan Lannister had been here, in this very hall when Tywin had laid the bodies of Prince Rhaegar's children at the foot of the Iron Throne, wrapped up in crimson cloaks. The girl had been recognizably the Princess Rhaenys, but the boy… a faceless horror of bone and brain and gore, a few hanks of fair hair. None of us looked long.

The Pentoshi were even less like to be of help than the Myrish money changers, but the effort must be made. Unless a new source of coin could be found, or the Iron Bank persuaded to relent, he would have no choice but to pay the crown's debts with Lannister gold. He dare not resort to new taxes, not with the Seven Kingdoms crawling with rebellion. Half the lords in the realm could not tell taxation from tyranny, and would bolt to the nearest usurper in a heartbeat if it would save them a clipped copper.

"His Grace named Ser Robert to the Kingsguard," Ser Kevan reminded him, "and Qyburn vouches for the man as well. Be that as it may, we need Ser Robert to prevail, my lords. If my niece is proved guilty of these treasons, the legitimacy of her children will be called into question. If Tommen ceases to be a king, Margaery will cease to be a queen." He let Tyrell chew on that a moment. "Whatever Cersei may have done, she is still a daughter of the Rock, of mine own blood. I will not let her die a traitor's death, but I have made sure to draw her fangs. All her guards have been dismissed and replaced with my own men.

In gold and silk and emeralds Cersei had been a queen, the next thing to a goddess; naked, she was only human, an aging woman with stretch marks on her belly and teats that had begun to sag… as the shrews in the crowds had been glad to point out to their husbands and lovers.

She grew so influential that it was said about Lannisport that any man who wished for his petition to be heard should kneel before her and speak loudly to her lap… for Tytos Lannister's ear was between his lady's legs. She had even taken to wearing their mother's jewels.</div>

<div class="line_en">He wanted guards, Ser Kevan thought. I should have sent him guards. Could Cersei have been right all along? Was this his nephew's work? "Tyrion?" he called. "Where…?"</div>

<div class="line_en">I have children. I have a wife. Oh, Dorna. Pain washed over him. He closed his eyes, opened them again. "There are… there are hundreds of Lannister guardsmen in this castle."</div>

<div class="line_en">He stood in a pool of shadow by a bookcase, plump, pale-faced, round-shouldered, clutching a crossbow in soft powdered hands. Silk slippers swaddled his feet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他站在一个书柜边的阴影里，浑圆，白脸，圆肩，柔软的擦了粉的手里抓着一把十字弓。丝质的拖鞋裹着他的脚。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But none in this room, thankfully. This pains me, my lord. You do not deserve to die alone on such a cold dark night. There are many like you, good men in service to bad causes… but you were threatening to undo all the queen's good work, to reconcile Highgarden and Casterly Rock, bind the Faith to your little king, unite the Seven Kingdoms under Tommen's rule. So…"</div>

<div class="line_en">"I thought the crossbow fitting. You shared so much with Lord Tywin, why not that? Your niece will think the Tyrells had you murdered, mayhaps with the connivance of the Imp. The Tyrells will suspect her. Someone somewhere will find a way to blame the Dornishmen. Doubt, division, and mistrust will eat the very ground beneath your boy king, whilst Aegon raises his banner above Storm's End and the lords of the realm gather round him."</div>

<div class="line_en">A gust of wind blew up. Ser Kevan shivered violently. "Are you cold, my lord?" asked Varys. "Do forgive me. The Grand Maester befouled himself in dying, and the stink was so abominable that I thought I might choke."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“伊耿？”一瞬间他有些难以理解。接着他想起来了，那个被深红斗篷包裹着的婴孩，都碰上满是他的脑浆和鲜血。“死了。他死了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No." The eunuch's voice seemed deeper. "He is here. Aegon has been shaped for rule since before he could walk. He has been trained in arms, as befits a knight to be, but that was not the end of his education. He reads and writes, he speaks several tongues, he has studied history and law and poetry. A septa has instructed him in the mysteries of the Faith since he was old enough to understand them. He has lived with fisherfolk, worked with his hands, swum in rivers and mended nets and learned to wash his own clothes at need. He can fish and cook and bind up a wound, he knows what it is like to be hungry, to be hunted, to be afraid. Tommen has been taught that kingship is his right. Aegon knows that kingship is his duty, that a king must put his people first, and live and rule for them."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不。”太监的声音似乎深沉了点。“他在这儿。伊耿在他还不会走路前就被打造以便统治。他被训练以武艺，适应骑士的要求，但是那不是他教育的全部。他能读会写，可以说好几种语言，学习历史法律与诗歌。一个修女自从他懂事开始便引导他以信仰的奥秘。他与渔民生活在一起，自己劳动，在河中游泳、补网，在必要时学习洗自己的衣服。他能打渔做饭打理伤口，他知道饥饿的感觉被追捕的感觉和害怕的感觉。他知道君王统治是他的责任，而一个国王以他的人民为先，他的统治与生存都是为了他们。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ser Kevan was cold as ice, and every labored breath sent a fresh stab of pain through him. He glimpsed movement, heard the soft scuffling sound of slippered feet on stone. A child emerged from a pool of darkness, a pale boy in a ragged robe, no more than nine or ten. Another rose up behind the Grand Maester's chair. The girl who had opened the door for him was there as well. They were all around him, half a dozen of them, white-faced children with dark eyes, boys and girls together.</div>
