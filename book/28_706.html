<div class="line_en">When I was a kid, my aspirations were simple. I wanted a dog. I wanted a house that had stairs in it -- two floors for one family. I wanted, for some reason, a four-door station wagon instead of the two-door Buick that was my father's pride and joy. I used to tell people that when I grew up, I was going to be a pediatrician. Why? Because I loved being around little kids and I quickly learned that it was a pleasing answer for adults to hear. Oh, a doctor! What a good choice! In those days, I wore pigtails and bossed my older brother around and managed, always and no matter what, to get As at school. I was ambitious, though I didn't know exactly what I was shooting for. Now I think it's one of the most useless questions an adult can ask a child -- What do you want to be when you grow up? As if growing up is finite. As if at some point you become something and that's the end.</div>

<div class="line_en">So far in my life, I've been a lawyer. I've been a vice president at a hospital and the director of a nonprofit that helps young people build meaningful careers. I've been a working-class black student at a fancy mostly white college. I've been the only woman, the only African American, in all sorts of rooms. I've been a bride, a stressed-out new mother, a daughter torn up by grief. And until recently, I was the First Lady of the United States of America -- a job that's not officially a job, but that nonetheless has given me a platform like nothing I could have imagined. It challenged me and humbled me, lifted me up and shrank me down, sometimes all at once. I'm just beginning to process what took place over these last years -- from the moment in 2006 when my husband first started talking about running for president to the cold morning this winter when I climbed into a limo with Melania Trump, accompanying her to her husband's inauguration. It's been quite a ride.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在我的人生中，我曾是一名律师，一家医院的副院长，一家帮助年轻人开创有意义的事业的非营利机构的负责人。我曾是一名出身工人阶层的黑人学生，在一所几乎全是白人学生的学费昂贵的大学里就读。我曾是各种场合中唯一的女士和非洲裔美国人。我曾是一位新娘、一位疲惫的新妈妈、一个伤心欲绝的女儿。直到不久前，我刚刚卸任美利坚合众国的第一夫人。第一夫人不是一份真正的工作，却给了我一个超乎想象的平台。它给我挑战，让我谦卑，鼓舞我，又贬低我，有时这些会同时发生。我刚刚开始回首过去这些年里发生的所有事，从2006年我丈夫谈起要竞选总统的那一刻，到今年（2017年）一个寒冷的冬日清晨，我和梅拉尼娅·特朗普步入同一辆轿车，陪她参加她丈夫的就职典礼。这一路走来，真是让人感慨良多。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When you're First Lady, America shows itself to you in its extremes. I've been to fund-raisers in private homes that look more like art museums, houses where people own bathtubs made from gemstones. I've visited families who lost everything in Hurricane Katrina and were tearful and grateful just to have a working refrigerator and stove. I've encountered people I find to be shallow and hypocritical and others -- teachers and military spouses and so many more -- whose spirits are so deep and strong it's astonishing. And I've met kids -- lots of them, all over the world -- who crack me up and fill me with hope and who blessedly manage to forget about my title once we start rooting around in the dirt of a garden.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当你成为第一夫人，美国在你面前便呈现出极端的面貌。我曾经去过募集资金者的私人宅邸，那里看起来像是一座艺术博物馆，里面的浴缸是用宝石制成的。我曾经访问过一些在“卡特里娜”飓风中失去一切的家庭，一台能用的冰箱、一个火炉就足以让他们流下感激的泪水。我遇到过一些浅薄虚伪的人，也遇到过一些精神高尚、坚强到令人惊讶的人，他们中有老师、军属等等。我也见过一些孩子—来自全世界的许多孩子，他们让我大笑，让我充满了希望，他们忘记了我的头衔，和我一起在菜园的泥土中东翻西找。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Since stepping reluctantly into public life, I've been held up as the most powerful woman in the world and taken down as an "angry black woman." I've wanted to ask my detractors which part of that phrase matters to them the most -- is it "angry" or "black" or "woman"? I've smiled for photos with people who call my husband horrible names on national television, but still want a framed keepsake for their mantel. I've heard about the swampy parts of the internet that question everything about me, right down to whether I'm a woman or a man. A sitting U. S. congressman has made fun of my butt. I've been hurt. I've been furious. But mostly, I've tried to laugh this stuff off.</div>

<div class="line_en">There's a lot I still don't know about America, about life, about what the future might bring. But I do know myself. My father, Fraser, taught me to work hard, laugh often, and keep my word. My mother, Marian, showed me how to think for myself and to use my voice. Together, in our cramped apartment on the South Side of Chicago, they helped me see the value in our story, in my story, in the larger story of our country. Even when it's not pretty or perfect. Even when it's more real than you want it to be. Your story is what you have, what you will always have. It is something to own.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="关于美国、关于人生、关于未来，我都还有很多不了解的地方。但是，我了解我自己。我的父亲弗雷泽教我努力工作，保持开心，信守承诺。我的母亲玛丽安教会我独立思考，发出自己的声音。在我们位于芝加哥南城的那间拥挤的公寓中，他们引导我认识我自己的故事、我们的故事以及我们国家的故事中蕴藏的价值。尽管它并不美好、并不完美，尽管它比你希望的更现实，但你的故事是属于你的，并且永远属于你，所以请珍视它。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For eight years, I lived in the White House, a place with more stairs than I can count -- plus elevators, a bowling alley, and an in-house florist. I slept in a bed that was made up with Italian linens. Our meals were cooked by a team of world-class chefs and delivered by professionals more highly trained than those at any five-star restaurant or hotel. Secret Service agents, with their earpieces and guns and deliberately flat expressions, stood outside our doors, doing their best to stay out of our family's private life. We got used to it, eventually, sort of -- the strange grandeur of our new home and also the constant, quiet presence of others.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我住在白宫八年，这个地方的楼梯多到我数不过来，里面还有许多部电梯、一个保龄球馆和一位常驻花艺师。我睡的床上铺着意大利亚麻布。我们一日三餐都由世界顶级厨师烹制，并由专业人员服侍进餐，他们比任何一家五星级饭店或宾馆的服务人员都要训练有素。特勤人员戴着耳机，端着枪，带着刻意保持的单调表情站在我们门外，尽力不打扰我们一家人的私生活。我们最终习惯了这一切—这个富丽堂皇得有点儿奇怪的新家，还有其他人常态而安静的存在。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The White House is where our two girls played ball in the hallways and climbed trees on the South Lawn. It's where Barack sat up late at night, poring over briefings and drafts of speeches in the Treaty Room, and where Sunny, one of our dogs, sometimes pooped on the rug. I could stand on the Truman Balcony and watch the tourists posing with their selfie sticks and peering through the iron fence, trying to guess at what went on inside. There were days when I felt suffocated by the fact that our windows had to be kept shut for security, that I couldn't get some fresh air without causing a fuss. There were other times when I'd be awestruck by the white magnolias blooming outside, the everyday bustle of government business, the majesty of a military welcome. There were days, weeks, and months when I hated politics. And there were moments when the beauty of this country and its people so overwhelmed me that I couldn't speak.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在白宫，我们的两个女儿会在走廊上玩球，在南草坪上爬树；贝拉克在条约厅熬夜工作，批阅简报，准备演讲稿；我们的狗萨尼有时会在地毯上拉屎。我站在杜鲁门阳台上，看着游客举着自拍杆拍照，从铁栅栏往里窥视，猜测里面发生的事情。有些日子里，我们的窗户因为安保原因一直关着，我感觉都要窒息了，因为我根本无法不受干扰地呼吸新鲜空气。还有些时候，外面盛放的白色木兰花、日日繁忙的政务，还有庄严的仪仗队，都会让我心生敬畏。在很多日子里，我对政治感到深恶痛绝；而在某些时刻，这个国家和它的人民的美，又让我惊异到无以言表。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then it was over. Even if you see it coming, even as your final weeks are filled with emotional good-byes, the day itself is still a blur. A hand goes on a Bible; an oath gets repeated. One president's furniture gets carried out while another's comes in. Closets are emptied and refilled in the span of a few hours. Just like that, there are new heads on new pillows -- new temperaments, new dreams. And when it ends, when you walk out the door that last time from the world's most famous address, you're left in many ways to find yourself again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后，一切结束了。即使你早就明白它会结束，即使你在这里的最后几周充满了动情的告别时刻，那一天在记忆里依然是一片模糊。一只手放在《圣经》上，一段誓言再一次被重复。一位总统的家具被抬走了，另一位总统的家具被抬进来。衣帽间清空了，几小时之后又被填满。就这样，新枕头上躺了新人—他们有新的性情，新的梦想。当一切结束，你从世界上最著名地点的那扇门最后一次走出时，你需要从很多方面重新找到自我。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So let me start here, with a small thing that happened not long ago. I was at home in the redbrick house that my family recently moved into. Our new house sits about two miles from our old house, on a quiet neighborhood street. We're still settling in. In the family room, our furniture is arranged the same way it was in the White House. We've got mementos around the house that remind us it was all real -- photos of our family time at Camp David, handmade pots given to me by Native American students, a book signed by Nelson Mandela. What was strange about this night was that everyone was gone. Barack was traveling. Sasha was out with friends. Malia's been living and working in New York, finishing out her gap year before college. It was just me, our two dogs, and a silent, empty house like I haven't known in eight years.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就让我从这里开始吧。不久前，发生了一件小事。我正待在我们的新家里，这是一栋红砖房子，坐落在一条安静的街上，距离我们的旧家大约两英里 [1]。我们刚搬来不久，还没有收拾停当。在家庭活动室，我们的家具布置得和在白宫时一样。房间里到处摆放着一些纪念品，提醒我们那些日子是真实的—我们一家人在戴维营的照片、美国原住民学生们送给我的手工陶制品、一本纳尔逊·曼德拉亲笔签名的书。不同的是，这天晚上其他人都不在。贝拉克正在旅行；萨沙和朋友出去了；玛利亚在纽约生活和工作，她正在经历上大学之前的间隔年。这里只有我，我们的两只狗，还有一个空荡而安静的房子，这是过去八年里我从未有过的体验。【注：[1] 1英里约等于1.61千米。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And I was hungry. I walked down the stairs from our bedroom with the dogs following on my heels. In the kitchen, I opened the fridge. I found a loaf of bread, took out two pieces, and laid them in the toaster oven. I opened a cabinet and got out a plate. I know it's a weird thing to say, but to take a plate from a shelf in the kitchen without anyone first insisting that they get it for me, to stand by myself watching bread turn brown in the toaster, feels as close to a return to my old life as I've come. Or maybe it's my new life just beginning to announce itself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我肚子有点儿饿，便从卧室走下楼梯，两只狗跟着我。我走进厨房，打开冰箱找到面包，拿出两片放在烤箱里。我又打开壁橱，取出一个盘子。我知道这么说很奇怪，但是自己从厨房架子上取下盘子而没有人抢着代劳，自己看着面包在烤箱里变得焦黄，这让我感觉回到了之前的生活。或者说，我的新生活从此宣告开启了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the end, I didn't just make toast; I made cheese toast, moving my slices of bread to the microwave and melting a fat mess of gooey cheddar between them. I then carried my plate outside to the backyard. I didn't have to tell anyone I was going. I just went. I was in bare feet, wearing a pair of shorts. The chill of winter had finally lifted. The crocuses were just starting to push up through the beds along our back wall. The air smelled like spring. I sat on the steps of our veranda, feeling the warmth of the day's sun still caught in the slate beneath my feet. A dog started barking somewhere in the distance, and my own dogs paused to listen, seeming momentarily confused. It occurred to me that it was a jarring sound for them, given that we didn't have neighbors, let alone neighbor dogs, at the White House. For them, all this was new. As the dogs loped off to explore the perimeter of the yard, I ate my toast in the dark, feeling alone in the best possible way. My mind wasn't on the group of guards with guns sitting less than a hundred yards away at the custom-built command post inside our garage, or the fact that I still can't walk down a street without a security detail. I wasn't thinking about the new president or for that matter the old president, either.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，我不光烤了面包，还做了一份烤乳酪三明治，我把面包片放在微波炉里，中间放了一大块油腻的切达奶酪。然后我端着盘子来到后院。这次，我不需要告诉任何人我要出去，而是就那么走了出去，光着脚，穿着一条短裤。冬日的寒意终于离去。番红花正努力沿着我家的后墙往上爬。空气中闻起来有春天的气息。我坐在走廊的台阶上，脚下的石板依然留有阳光的余温。一只狗在远处吠了起来，我家的两只狗驻足细听，似乎一时有点儿迷惑。我意识到，这个声音对它们而言是刺耳的，因为我们在白宫时没有邻居，更不要提邻居的狗了。对于它们来说，所有这一切都是全新的。当两只狗在院子里跑来跑去时，我在黑暗中吃我的面包，试图享受这种孤单。我的心思不在离我不到一百码 [2]的那队配枪卫兵身上，他们正坐在我们车库里的特设指挥部内；我没去想现在我上街依然还得有安保人员陪同；我也没去想那位新任总统，甚至也没想那位卸任总统。【注：[2] 1码约等于0.91米。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I was thinking instead about how in a few minutes I would go back inside my house, wash my plate in the sink, and head up to bed, maybe opening a window so I could feel the spring air -- how glorious that would be. I was thinking, too, that the stillness was affording me a first real opportunity to reflect. As First Lady, I'd get to the end of a busy week and need to be reminded how it had started. But time is beginning to feel different. My girls, who arrived at the White House with their Polly Pockets, a blanket named Blankie, and a stuffed tiger named Tiger, are now teenagers, young women with plans and voices of their own. My husband is making his own adjustments to life after the White House, catching his own breath. And here I am, in this new place, with a lot I want to say.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我在想的是，几分钟后，我要回到屋子里，清洗水槽里的盘子，然后上床睡觉，也许开一扇窗，就可以嗅到春天的气息—那真是太美好了。同时我在想，这种安静让我第一次可以真正地思考。作为第一夫人，我已经习惯了日复一日的忙碌，忙到连不久前在忙什么都忘了。但是，现在我开始感觉不同了。我的女儿们，她们初到白宫时，带着她们的“波利口袋” [3]一条名为“布兰基”的毯子和一个名叫“泰格”的老虎布偶。而现在她们已经长大了，成了有计划、有主见的年轻女士。我的丈夫正在休整，让自己适应后白宫时期的生活。而我在这里，在我的新家，心里有很多话想说。【注：[3]“波利口袋”（Polly Pocket），一种于20世纪80年代末至90年代后半期盛行于美国的古董玩具，深受女孩喜爱。经典款式的“波利口袋”为一个个形状、大小、颜色各异的盒子，打开后有各式各样的场景，如公寓、酒店、餐厅等，里面有小人等配件。孩子们可以发挥想象力虚构一个个情节。美国南方的孩子又将之称为“八宝盒”。】">查看中文翻译</div>
