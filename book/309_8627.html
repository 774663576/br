<div class="line_en">The first raid, as it turned out, was not a raid at all. Had people waited to see the planes, they would have stood there all night. That accounted for the fact that no cuckoo had called from the radio. The Molching Express reported that a certain flak tower operator had become a little overexcited. He'd sworn that he could hear the rattle of planes and see them on the horizon. He sent the word.</div>

<div class="line_en">Eerie air followed them down to the Fiedlers' basement. "I think it's real tonight," said Mr. Fiedler, and the children quickly realized that their parents were even more afraid this time around. Reacting the only way they knew, the youngest of them began to wail and cry as the room seemed to swing.</div>

<div class="line_en">Again, Himmel Street was a trail of people, and again, Papa left his accordion. Rosa reminded him to take it, but he refused. "I didn't take it last time," he explained, "and we lived." War clearly blurred the distinction between logic and superstition.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Shut that kid up!" Frau Holtzapfel clamored, but her sentence was just another hapless voice in the warm chaos of the shelter. Grimy tears were loosened from children's eyes, and the smell of night breath, underarm sweat, and overworn clothes was stirred and stewed in what was now a cauldron swimming with humans.</div>

Hans Hubermann came closer and called out, and soon, a quietness started bleeding through the crowded basement. By page three, everyone was silent but Liesel.</div>

<div class="line_en">For at least twenty minutes, she handed out the story. The youngest kids were soothed by her voice, and everyone else saw visions of the whistler running from the crime scene. Liesel did not. The book thief saw only the mechanics of the words -- their bodies stranded on the paper, beaten down for her to walk on. Somewhere, too, in the gaps between a period and the next capital letter, there was also Max. She remembered reading to him when he was sick. Is he in the basement? she wondered. Or is he stealing a glimpse of the sky again?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她至少读了二十分钟，故事从她嘴里流淌出来。最年幼的几个孩子也被她的声音安抚，人们似乎都看到了吹口哨的人从作案现场逃逸的场面。但这样的场景并没有出现在莉泽尔眼前。她看到了文字的脉络，它们困在纸上，被她不断地抖落下来，让故事继续下去。马克斯竟然也出现在句号和下一句句首那个大写字母之间的空隙里。她还记得他生病的时候，自己曾读书给他听。他现在是不是在地下室里？疑问在她心中升起。他是不是又偷偷出来看天空了？">查看中文翻译</div>
