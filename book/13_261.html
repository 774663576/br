<div class="line_en">Tired as he was Merry could not sleep. He had ridden now for four days on end, and the ever-deepening gloom had slowly weighed down his heart. He began to wonder why he had been so eager to come, when he had been given every excuse, even his lord's command, to stay behind. He wondered, too, if the old King knew that he had been disobeyed and was angry. Perhaps not. There seemed to be some understanding between Dernhelm and Elfhelm, the Marshal who commanded the éored in which they were riding. He and all his men ignored Merry and pretended not to hear if he spoke. He might have been just another bag that Dernhelm was carrying. Dernhelm was no comfort: he never spoke to anyone. Merry felt small, unwanted, and lonely. Now the time was anxious, and the host was in peril. They were less than a day's ride from the out-walls of Minas Tirith that encircled the townlands. Scouts had been sent ahead. Some had not returned. Others hastening back had reported that the road was held in force against them. A host of the enemy was encamped upon it, three miles west of Amon Dîn, and some strength of men was already thrusting along the road and was no more than three leagues away. Orcs were roving in the hills and woods along the roadside. The king and Éomer held council in the watches of the night.</div>

<div class="line_en">He could not see them, but he knew that all round him were the companies of the Rohirrim. He could smell the horses in the dark, and could hear their shiftings and their soft stamping on the needle-covered ground. The host was bivouacked in the pine-woods that clustered about Eilenach Beacon, a tall hill standing up from the long ridges of the Drúadan Forest that lay beside the great road in East Anórien.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was dark and Merry could see nothing as he lay on the ground rolled in a blanket; yet though the night was airless and windless, all about him hidden trees were sighing softly. He lifted his head. Then he heard it again: a sound like faint drums in the wooded hills and mountain-steps. The throb would cease suddenly and then be taken up again at some other point, now nearer, now further off. He wondered if the watchmen had heard it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="梅里躺在地上，裹在毯子内，由于四周伸手不见五指，所以他什么也看不见。可是，虽然夜空中一点微风也没有，四周的树木却都在微微地叹息。他抬起头。然后他又听见了那声音：像是在茂密的森林与山丘中回汤的微弱鼓声。这脉动声有时会突然消失，然后又在其他的地方接续下来，有时远，有时近，不知道值夜的卫兵是否听见了这声音。">查看中文翻译</div>

Merry wished he was a tall Rider like Éomer and could blow a horn or something and go galloping to his rescue. He sat up, listening to the drums that were beating again, now nearer at hand.

<div class="line_en">Merry did not like this talk of wild men and poisoned darts, but quite apart from that a great weight of dread was on him. Waiting was unbearable. He longed to know what was going to happen. He got up and soon was walking warily in pursuit of the last lantern before it disappeared among the trees.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="梅里并不太喜欢野人和淬毒的箭矢，但是，他还有比这个更沉重的事情要担心。等待实在让人难以忍受，他非常想要知道究竟会发生什么事情。他站了起来，很快就按照之前最后一盏油灯出现的路线追了过去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Nay, nay," said Elfhelm, "the enemy is on the road not in the hills. You hear the Woses, the Wild Men of the Woods: thus they talk together from afar. They still haunt Drúadan Forest, it is said. Remnants of an older time they be, living few and secretly, wild and wary as the beasts. They go not to war with Gondor or the Mark; but now they are troubled by the darkness and the coming of the orcs: they fear lest the Dark Years be returning, as seems likely enough. Let us be thankful that they are not hunting us: for they use poisoned arrows, it is said, and they are woodcrafty beyond compare. But they have offered their services to Théoden. Even now one of their headmen is being taken to the king. Yonder go the lights. So much I have heard but no more. And now I must busy myself with my lord's commands. Pack yourself up, Master Bag!" He vanished into the shadows.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，不是，”艾海姆说：“敌人在道路上，不在山里。你听见的是沃斯人，他们是居住在森林中的野人，靠着鼓声来交谈。据说他们还居住在督伊顿森林中。他们是远古遗留下来的少数民族，十分隐密地居住在森林中，过着像是野兽一般机饯和小心的生活。他们不会和刚铎或洛汗作战，但现在他们为了这黑暗和半兽人的出现而担心，他们害怕黑暗的年代又要重新降临了。我们最好感谢他们不准备猎杀我们，谣传他们使用的是毒箭，在野外求生和箭术上更是无人能敌。不过，他们自愿要协助希优顿王，刚刚他们的首领才被带到骠骑王身边，这也是火光的来源。我只听说了这么多，我得赶快去执行王上的命令了。赶快打包好吧，袋子先生！”他消失在阴影中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a silence as Merry crept nearer, and then the Wild Man began to speak, in answer to some question, it seemed. His voice was deep and guttural, yet to Merry's surprise he spoke the Common Speech, though in a halting fashion, and uncouth words were mingled with it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当梅里靠近的时候，众人正陷入沉默，接着，野人开口说话了。看来似乎是在回答某个问题。他的声音十分低沉、沙哑，但梅里惊讶地发现，他所使用的竟然是通用语；只是有些迟疑，中间还夹杂着一些不标准的发音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Presently he came to an open space where a small tent had been set up for the king under a great tree. A large lantern, covered above, was hanging from a bough and cast a pale circle of light below. There sat Théoden and Éomer, and before them on the ground sat a strange squat shape of a man, gnarled as an old stone, and the hairs of his scanty beard straggled on his lumpy chin like dry moss. He was short-legged and fat-armed, thick and stumpy, and clad only with grass about his waist. Merry felt that he had seen him before somewhere, and suddenly he remembered the Púkel-men of Dunharrow. Here was one of those old images brought to life, or maybe a creature descended in true line through endless years from the models used by the forgotten craftsmen long ago.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不久之后，他来到了一块空地上，骠骑王的帐篷就设立在一株大树下，一盏上方被遮掩住的油灯挂在树枝上，对四周投射出苍白微弱的光芒。希优顿和伊欧墨坐在地上，面前则是一个相貌奇怪的人。他看起来如同岩石一样的苍老，一头乱发和胡须，则是像苔藓一样挂在他肥胖的脑袋和下巴上。他的腿很短，身材很臃肿，只有腰间挂着蔽体的草叶。梅里觉得之前似乎看过这个人，接着，他突然想起了登哈洛的普哥人。他长得和那些雕像一模一样，或许他就是那些远古的工匠所雕琢的对象。">查看中文翻译</div>

If you are faithful, Ghân-buri-Ghân, then we will give you rich reward, and you shall have the friendship of the Mark for ever."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伊欧墨和骠骑王用洛汗的语言交谈了片刻。最后，希优顿转向野人说：“我们愿意接受你的协助，”他说：“虽然我们自己的家园也遭到了敌人攻击，但那又怎么样呢？如果岩城陷落，我们也不需要回去了；如果它得救了，那些部队的补给线也会被切断。刚布理刚，如果你说的是真的，我们会给予你丰厚的奖励，骠骑将永远成为你的盟友。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Let Ghân-buri-Ghân finish!" said the Wild Man. "More than one road he knows. He will lead you by road where no pits are, no gorgûn walk, only Wild Men and beasts. Many paths were made when Stonehouse-folk were stronger. They carved hills as hunters carve beast-flesh. Wild Men think they ate stone for food. They went through Drúadan to Rimmon with great wains. They go no longer. Road is forgotten, but not by Wild Men. Over hill and behind hill it lies still under grass and tree, there behind Rimmon and down to Dîn, and back at the end to Horse-men's road. Wild Men will show you that road. Then you will kill gorgûn and drive away bad dark with bright iron, and Wild Men can go back to sleep in the wild woods."</div>

<div class="line_en">All went well that day, and no sight or sound had they of the enemy waiting to waylay them. The Wild Men had put out a screen of wary hunters, so that no orc or roving spy should learn of the movements in the hills. The light was more dim than ever as they drew nearer to the beleaguered city, and the Riders passed in long files like dark shadows of men and horses. Each company was guided by a wild woodman; but old Ghân walked beside the king. The start had been slower than was hoped, for it had taken time for the Riders, walking and leading their horses, to find paths over the thickly wooded ridges behind their camp and down into the hidden Stonewain Valley. It was late in the afternoon when the leaders came to wide grey thickets stretching beyond the eastward side of Amon Dîn, and masking a great gap in the line of hills that from Nardol to Dîn ran east and west. Through the gap the forgotten wain-road long ago had run down, back into the main horse-way from the City through Anórien; but now for many lives of men trees had had their way with it, and it had vanished, broken and buried under the leaves of uncounted years. But the thickets offered to the Riders their last hope of cover before they went into open battle; for beyond them lay the road and the plains of Anduin, while east and southwards the slopes were bare and rocky, as the writhen hills gathered themselves together and climbed up, bastion upon bastion, into the great mass and shoulders of Mindolluin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天一切都进行得十分顺利，他们完全没有发现任何可能阻碍行进的敌人。野人把许多机饯的猎人派了出去，不让任何的半兽人或间谍有机会打探山中的调动。当他们靠近被包围的城市时，光线变得越来越微弱，骠骑们像是黑色的剪影一般在黑暗中穿梭。每个连队都有一名野人负责带领，刚则是亲自走在希优顿身边。出发的时间花得比预期的要久，骠骑们浪费了不少时间才把马匹牵到营地后面的浓密森林中，进入隐藏的石车谷。当先锋踏上阿蒙丁山东方的宽广平地时，大约已经是下午了，这边果然有一条被从那多到阿蒙丁山的丘陵所遮挡的道路。这条古代马车可以通行的道路穿越了隘口，一路伸展下去，在安诺瑞安再度和通往主城的马道会合。不过，这条道路已经有许多许多年没有人使用了，它已经多处断裂，被掩盖在无数年累积的树叶和浓密的树林之下，但这树林正好提供了骠骑们参战前隐藏行踪的最后机会；因为，在那之后就是通往安都因平原的道路，而东方和南方的山坡都是多岩而没有遮蔽的。这些光秃秃的山脉绵延不断，和明都陆安山的庞大身躯连结在一起。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was no more than a league to where the out-walls had stood. They soon reached them; too soon for Merry. Wild cries broke out, and there was some clash of arms, but it was brief. The orcs busy about the walls were few and amazed, and they were quickly slain or driven off. Before the ruin of the north-gate in the Rammas the king halted again. The first éored drew up behind him and about him on either side.

Still they were unchallenged, and still Théoden gave no signal. At last he halted once again. The City was now nearer. A smell of burning was in the air and a very shadow of death. The horses were uneasy. But the king sat upon Snowmane, motionless, gazing upon the agony of Minas Tirith, as if stricken suddenly by anguish, or by dread. He seemed to shrink down, cowed by age. Merry himself felt as if a great weight of horror and doubt had settled on him. His heart beat slowly. Time seemed poised in uncertainty. They were too late! Too late was worse than never! Perhaps Théoden would quail, bow his old head, turn, slink away to hide in the hills.</div>

For morning came, morning and a wind from the sea; and darkness was removed, and the hosts of Mordor wailed, and terror took them, and they fled, and died, and the hoofs of wrath rode over them. And then all the host of Rohan burst into song, and they sang as they slew, for the joy of battle was on them, and the sound of their singing that was fair and terrible came even to the City.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="骠骑王对雪鬃大喊一声，骏马立刻撒开四蹄狂奔。他身后的旗帜在风中飞舞，白色的骏马在绿色的草原上驰骋，但连这旗帜都追不上他的冲势。骠骑全军万马奔腾地紧跟在后，骠骑王仍然一马当先地冲向敌人。伊欧墨紧追不舍，头盔上白色的马尾在风中翻飞，第一马队来势汹汹，但还是都赶不上希优顿。他看起来像是万夫莫敌的狂人，列祖列宗的血液都在他的体内沸腾，就像是主神之战中的骑神欧罗米一样威风凛凛。他高举黄金的盾牌，反射出万道金光，座骑的四蹄彷佛都被绿色的火焰包围。黎明的确降临了，曙光和南方的海风一起来临，让黑暗退却，魔多的大军忐忑不安，军心动摇；他们不停逃窜、束手无策地接受愤怒的骑士制裁，有些死在长枪下，有些死在马蹄下。洛汗国所有的骠骑唱起雄壮的战歌，同时毫不留情地斩杀敌人，因为这是他们最辉煌的一战。他们震耳的歌声随风飘送，进入动汤不安的王城中。">查看中文翻译</div>
