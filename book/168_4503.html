<div class="line_en">They would be, she knew. She had stolen three horses from the stables and a map and a dagger from Roose Bolton's own solar, and killed a guard on the postern gate, slitting his throat when he knelt to pick up the worn iron coin that jaqen H'ghar had given her. Someone would find him lying dead in his own blood, and then the hue and cry would go up. They would wake Lord Bolton and search Harrenhal from crenel to cellar, and when they did they would find the map and the dagger missing, along with some swords from the armory, bread and cheese from the kitchens, a baker boy, a 'prentice smith, and a cupbearer called Nan… or Weasel, or Arry, depending on who you asked.</div>

<div class="line_en">They rode north, away from the lake, following a rutted farm road across the torn fields and into the woods and streams. Arya took the lead, kicking her stolen horse to a brisk heedless trot until the trees closed in around her. Hot Pie and Gendry followed as best they could. Wolves howled off in the distance, and she could hear Hot Pie's heavy breathing. No one spoke. From time to time Arya glanced over her shoulder, to make sure the two boys had not fallen too far behind, and to see if they were being pursued.</div>

<div class="line_en">Every time she looked back, she half expected to see a blaze of torches pouring out the distant gates of Harrenhal or rushing along the tops of its huge high walls, but there was nothing. Harrenhal slept on, until it was lost in darkness and hidden behind the trees.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Lord of the Dreadfort would not come after them himself. Roose Bolton would stay abed, his pasty flesh dotted with leeches, giving commands in his whispery soft voice. His man Walton might lead the hunt, the one they called Steelshanks for the greaves he always wore on his long legs. Or perhaps it would be slobbery Vargo Hoat and his sellswords, who named themselves the Brave Companions. others called them Bloody Mummers (though never to their faces), and sometimes the Footmen, for Lord Vargo's habit of cutting off the hands and feet of men who displeased him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Gendry and Hot Pie did not question her choice. She had the map, after all, and Hot Pie seemed almost as terrified of her as of the men who might be coming after them. He had seen the guard she'd killed. It's better if he's scared of me, she told herself. That way he'll do like I say, instead of something stupid.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="詹德利和热派没有质疑她的决定。毕竟她有地图，而热派看来同害怕追捕者一样怕她。他亲眼目睹过被她杀掉的守卫。算了，他怕我未必不好，她提醒自己，如此一来，就会乖乖听话，而不是自己干出些蠢笨事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When they crossed the first stream, Arya turned her horse aside and led them off the road, following the twisting course of the water for a quarter-mile before finally scrambling out and up a stony bank. If the hunters brought dogs, that might throw them off the scent, she hoped. They could not stay on the road. There is death on the road, she told herself, death on all the roads.</div>

<div class="line_en">She should be more frightened herself, she knew. She was only ten, a skinny girl on a stolen horse with a dark forest ahead of her and men behind who would gladly cut off her feet. Yet somehow she felt calmer than she ever had in Harrenhal. The rain had washed the guard's blood off her fingers, she wore a sword across her back, wolves were prowling through the dark like lean grey shadows, and Arya Stark was unafraid. Fear cuts deeper than swords, she whispered under her breath, the words that Syrio Forel had taught her, and jaqen's words too, valar morghulis.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其实我应该更胆小的，她心想，她才十岁，瘦骨伶仃，骑在一匹偷来的马上，前面是黑黑的森林，后方是想剁下她脚的追兵。但不知为什么，她觉得自己比从前在赫伦堡时镇静多了。雨水洗掉指间卫兵的鲜血，背上的长剑在风中摇荡，无数野狼如灰色阴影，狂奔于暗夜，而她艾莉亚·史塔克一往无前，无所畏惧。恐惧比利剑更伤人，她低声复诵着西利欧的教诲，还有贾昆的话语，valarmorghulis。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Gendry's mare lost her footing in the mud once, going down hard on her hindquarters and spilling him from the saddle, but neither horse nor rider was hurt, and Gendry got that stubborn look on his face and mounted right up again. Not long after, they came upon three wolves devouring the corpse of a fawn. When Hot Pie's horse caught the scent, he shied and bolted. Two of the wolves fled as well, but the third raised his head and bared his teeth, prepared to defend his kill. "Back off," Arya told Gendry. "Slow, so you don't spook him." They edged their mounts away, until the wolf and his feast were no longer in sight. Only then did she swing about to ride after Hot Pie, who was clinging desperately to the saddle as he crashed through the trees.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="忽然，詹德利的母马绊倒在泥潭中，后腿跪倒，将他掀出马鞍，幸而人马都平安无恙。詹德利还是那副固执样，迅速翻身上马，继续前进，什么也没说。没过多久，他们目睹三匹野狼在吞食一只小鹿的尸体。热派的马闻到血腥味，惊恐地人立起来，随后亡命奔跑。两匹狼见状逃之夭夭，但第三匹抬起头，露出牙齿，准备保卫自己的猎获。“往后退，”艾莉亚告诉詹德利，“慢慢走，别吓着它。”他们骑马缓缓绕开此地，直到再看不见野狼和它的美餐，这时她才拍马追赶热派，只见男孩绝望地抓着马鞍，他的马在森林里乱撞。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The rain stopped and started again and stopped once more and started, but they had good cloaks to keep the water off. Arya kept them moving at a slow steady pace. It was too black beneath the trees to ride any faster; the boys were no horsemen, neither one, and the soft broken ground was treacherous with half-buried roots and hidden stones. They crossed another road, its deep ruts filled with runoff, but Arya shunned it. Up and down the rolling hills she took them, through brambles and briars and tangles of underbrush, along the bottoms of narrow gullies where branches heavy with wet leaves slapped at their faces as they passed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雨停了又下，下了又停，还好斗篷足以遮蔽风雨。艾莉亚驱使他们保持稳定的速度前进。大树底下漆黑一片，地面松软，布满裂缝，到处是半掩埋的树根和隐藏的石块，男孩们都不善骑术，无法高速前进。很快，他们越过又一条道路，路上深深的车辙印里盛满了雨水。艾莉亚再次远离道路，带着男孩们在起伏的丘陵中穿梭，越过荆棘、石蓝和纠缠的灌木，深入狭窄山沟的底部，沉重的树枝夹着潮湿的树叶，一次又一次抽打着他们的脸。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Later they passed through a burned village, threading their way carefully between the shells of blackened hovels and past the bones of a dozen dead men hanging from a row of apple trees. When Hot Pie saw them he began to pray, a thin whispered plea for the Mother's mercy, repeated over and over. Arya looked up at the fleshless dead in their wet rotting clothes and said her own prayer. Ser Gregor, it went, Dunsen, Polliver, Raff the Sweetling. The Tickler and the Hound. Ser Ilyn, Ser Meryn, King Joffrey, Queen Cersei. She ended it with valar morghulis, touched jaqen's coin where it nestled under her belt, and then reached up and plucked an apple from among the dead men as she rode beneath them. It was mushy and overripe, but she ate it worms and all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="再后来，他们经过一个焚毁的村落，小心翼翼地踏过那些被烧成黑炭的小屋空壳途中，发现一排苹果树上吊死了十来个人，尸体业已腐烂到骨。热派为他们祈祷，恳求圣母的慈悲，他轻声低语，一次又一次地重复。艾莉亚盯着这些披着湿透的褴褛衣杉的无肉躯体，说的是自己的祷词：克雷果爵士，邓森、波利佛、“甜嘴”拉夫，记事本和猎狗，伊林爵士，马林爵士，乔佛里国王，瑟曦太后。她碰了碰藏在腰带下的贾昆给的硬币，以valarmorghulis结束了名单。接着她骑到死人身下，伸手摘下一个苹果。苹果熟透，烂成了糊，她连着蠕虫一起吞吃。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That was the day without a dawn. Slowly the sky lightened around them, but they never saw the sun. Black turned to grey, and colors crept timidly back into the world. The soldier pines were dressed in somber greens, the broadleafs in russets and faded golds already beginning to brown. They stopped long enough to water the horses and eat a cold, quick breakfast, ripping apart a loaf of the bread that Hot Pie had stolen from the kitchens and passing chunks of hard yellow cheese from hand to hand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那是没有黎明的一天，天空缓缓放亮，但看不到太阳。漆黑变成灰暗，色泽犹犹豫豫地重现人间，哨兵树呈现出暗绿的色彩，黄褐和淡金色的阔叶几乎成了棕色。他们停下来喂马喝水，同时吃了一顿冰凉的方便早餐，有热派从厨房偷出来的面包，还有黄色的硬奶酪。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="因为奔流城是我外公的城堡，而我哥哥罗柏在那里，艾莉亚几乎冲口而出。但她咬紧嘴唇，叠好地图，“我们只能这样希望。先到了再说吧。”说罢，她翻身上马。向热派隐瞒真相，她心里挺不舒服，但这是没办法的事，她无法信任他。詹德利是知道的，但他情况不同。詹德利有自己的秘密，虽然这秘密究竟是什么，连他自己也很迷惑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That day Arya quickened their pace, keeping the horses to a trot as long as she dared, and sometimes spurring to a gallop when she spied a flat stretch of fleld before them. That was seldom enough, though; the ground was growing hillier as they went. The hills were not high, nor especially steep, but there seemed to be no end of them, and they soon grew tired of climbing up one and down the other, and found themselves following the lay of the land, along streambeds and through a maze of shallow wooded valleys where the trees made a solid canopy overhead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="出发之后，艾莉亚让他们加快速度，要马儿以尽可能大的步幅前进。有好几次，当她看到面前出现大块平地时，便用马刺猛地扎马，飞奔起来。不过，她心知速度仍远远不够。路越来越颠簸，这些丘陵不高，也不很陡，但似乎无穷无尽，他们很快便厌倦了无休止地爬上爬下，情愿跟着地势走。顺着小河床，穿行在错综复杂的小峡谷中，周围满是树木，为他们罩上一顶巨大的华盖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">From time to time she sent Hot Pie and Gendry on while she doubled back to try to confuse their trail, listening all the while for the first sign of pursuit. Too slow, she thought to herself, chewing her lip, we're going too slow, they'll catch us for certain. once, from the crest of a ridge, she spied dark shapes crossing a stream in the valley behind them, and for half a heartbeat she feared that Roose Bolton's riders were on them, but when she looked again she realized they were only a pack of wolves. She cupped her hands around her mouth and howled down at them, "Ahooooooooo, ahooooooooo." When the largest of the wolves lifted its head and howled back, the sound made Arya shiver.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不时，她让热派和詹德利先行，自己循原路返回去掩盖足迹。自始自终，她都竖起耳朵，等待追兵的出现。太慢了，她咬着嘴唇，提醒自己，我们走得太慢，一定会被追上的。有一回，走在山脊上时，她发现有些黑影正穿越他们身后那道峡谷里的小溪，半晌之间，她惶恐地认定卢斯·波顿的骑兵已经赶上，可仔细一看，那不过是一群狼。于是她用手围住嘴巴，朝狼群吼叫：“啊呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜，啊呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜呜。”狼群里最大那匹狼抬起头，跟着她吼，声音让艾莉亚不禁浑身颤抖。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Gendry was having almost as bad a time of it as Hot Pie, though he was too stubborn to complain. He sat awkwardly in the saddle, a determined look on his face beneath his shaggy black hair, but Arya could tell he was no horseman. I should have remembered, she thought to herself. She had been riding as long as she could remember, ponies when she was little and later horses, but Gendry and Hot Pie were city-born, and in the city smallfolk walked. Yoren had given them mounts when he took them from King's Landing, but sitting on a donkey and plodding up the kingsroad behind a wagon was one thing. Guiding a hunting horse through wild woods and burned fields was something else.</div>

If the Mummers catch us, I'll tell them that I'm Ned Stark's daughter and sister to the King in the North. I'll command them to take me to my brother, and to do no harm to Hot Pie and Gendry. They might not believe her, though, and even if they did… Lord Bolton was her brother's bannerman, but he frightened her all the same.

<div class="line_en">She had to ride a good half mile along the bank before she finally found a place where it looked as though it might be safe to cross, and even then her mare was reluctant to enter the water. The river, whatever its name, was running brown and fast, and the deep part in the middle came up past the horse's belly. Water filled her boots, but she pressed in her heels all the same and climbed out on the far bank. From behind she heard splashing, and a mare's nervous whinny. They followed, then. Good.

She let them close, just for an instant, then snapped them wide again. I can't go to sleep, she screamed at herself silently, I can't, I can't. She knuckled at her eye and rubbed it hard to keep it open, clutching the reins tightly and kicking her mount to a canter.

She wondered how long it would be before she slept in a bed again, with hot food and a fire to warm her.
