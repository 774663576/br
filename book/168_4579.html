<div class="line_en">Iron Emmett was a long, lanky young ranger whose endurance, strength, and swordsmanship were the pride of Eastwatch. Jon always came away from their sessions stiff and sore, and woke the next day covered with bruises, which was just the way he wanted it. He would never get any better going up against the likes of Satin and Horse, or even Grenn.</div>

<div class="line_en">Most days he gave as good as he got, Jon liked to think, but not today. He had hardly slept last night, and after an hour of restless tossing he had given up even the attempt, dressed, and walked the top of the Wall till the sun came up, wrestling with Stannis Baratheon's offer. The lack of sleep was catching up with him now, and Emmett was hammering him mercilessly across the yard, driving him back on his heels with one long looping cut after another, and slamming him with his shield from time to time for good measure. Jon's arm had gone numb from the shock of impact, and the edgeless practice sword seemed to be growing heavier with every passing moment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="琼恩认为大多数时候，自己挨打跟回敬的次数差不多，但今天并非如此。昨晚他几乎没睡，翻来覆去一个钟头之后，便放弃尝试，穿好衣服，来到长城之巅，反复思考史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩的提议，直到太阳升起。缺少睡眠使他受了惩罚，埃梅特无情地发动攻击，一下又一下的回旋砍逼迫他在校场中步步后退，时不时还拿盾牌加以冲撞。琼恩的胳膊逐渐麻木，随着时间推移，没有锋刃的钝剑也显得沉重起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was almost ready to lower his blade and call a halt when Emmett feinted low and came in over his shield with a savage forehand slash that caught Jon on the temple. He staggered, his helm and head both ringing from the force of the blow. For half a heartbeat the world beyond his eyeslit was a blur.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他正打算垂剑叫停，不料埃梅特佯攻下盘，然后以一记凶猛的正手劈，越过琼恩的盾牌，直取太阳穴。他脚步蹒跚，重击之下，头盔和脑袋同时嗡嗡作响。顷刻之间，眼缝外的世界一片模糊。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That morning he called it first. "I'm Lord of Winterfell!" he cried, as he had a hundred times before. only this time, this time, Robb had answered, "You can't be Lord of Winterfell, you're bastard-born. My lady mother says you can't ever be the Lord of Winterfell."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一天早上，他最先夸口，“我是临冬城公爵！”过去，他上百次这样呼叫。只有这次，就这一次，罗柏答道，“你不可能成为临冬城公爵，你是私生子，我母亲大人说，你永远得不到临冬城。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And then the years were gone, and he was back at Winterfell once more, wearing a quilted leather coat in place of mail and plate. His sword was made of wood, and it was Robb who stood facing him, not iron Emmett.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="岁月如梭，他又回到了临冬城，穿着加衬垫的皮外套，不是锁甲和板甲。他拿起木剑，面对罗柏，而非埃恩·伊梅特。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Every morning they had trained together, since they were big enough to walk; Snow and Stark, spinning and slashing about the wards of Winterfell, shouting and laughing, sometimes crying when there was no one else to see. They were not little boys when they fought, but knights and mighty heroes. "I'm Prince Aemon the Dragonknight," Jon would call out, and Robb would shout back, "Well, I'm Florian the Fool." Or Robb would say, "I'm the Young Dragon," and Jon would reply, "I'm Ser Ryam Redwyne."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从学会走路开始，他们每天早晨都一起练武，雪诺和史塔克，在临冬城内兜圈比划，笑闹叫嚷，没有人看见的时候，还会哭。他们不是小孩子，而是骑士和英雄。“我是龙骑士伊蒙王子！”琼恩大喊，而罗柏吼回去，“我是‘傻瓜’佛罗理安！”或者“我是少龙主！”然后琼恩回答，“我是莱安·雷德温爵士！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the end Halder and Horse had to pull him away from Iron Emmett, one man on either arm. The ranger sat on the ground dazed, his shield half in splinters, the visor of his helm knocked askew, and his sword six yards away. "Jon, enough," Halder was shouting, "he's down, you disarmed him. Enough!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="霍德和马儿不得不一人架一条胳膊，将他拖离埃恩·伊梅特身边。游骑兵头晕目眩地坐倒在地，盾牌几乎成为碎片，头盔的面甲被打歪，钝剑飞出六码之外。“琼恩，够了，”霍德喊，“他输了，你解除了他的武装。够了！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Iron Emmett pulled his battered helm off. "Was there some part of yield you could not comprehend, Lord Snow?" It was said amiably, though.

<div class="line_en">That was too much. Jon wrenched free of his friends and retreated to the armory, alone. His ears were still ringing from the blow Emmett had dealt him.

<div class="line_en">It was not Lord Eddard's face he saw floating before him, though; it was Lady Catelyn's. With her deep blue eyes and hard cold mouth, she looked a bit like Stannis. Iron, he thought, but brittle. She was looking at him the way she used to look at him at Winterfell, whenever he had bested Robb at swords or sums or most anything. Who are you? that look had always seemed to say. This is not your place. Why are you here?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而眼前浮现的却不是艾德公爵的脸，而是凯特琳夫人。她那深沉的蓝眼睛和严厉冰冷的嘴唇，看上去就像史坦尼斯。和铁一样，他心想，弯曲之前就会先断掉。以前在临冬城，不管剑法、算术还是别的东西，只要表现优于罗柏，她就会用这样的眼神打量他。你是谁？那双蓝眼睛说，这里不欢迎你，你来这里做什么？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His friends were still out in the practice yard, but Jon was in no fit state to face them. He left the armory by the back, descending a steep flight of stone steps to the wormways, the tunnels that linked the castle's keeps and towers below the earth. It was short walk to the bathhouse, where he took a cold plunge to wash the sweat off and soaked in a hot stone tub. The warmth took some of the ache from his muscles and made him think of Winterfell's muddy pools, steaming and bubbling in the godswood. Winterfell, he thought. Theon left it burned and broken, but I could restore it. Surely his father would have wanted that, and Robb as well. They would never have wanted the castle left in ruins.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="朋友们仍在练武，但依琼恩现下的心情，实在无法面对他们。于是他从后门离开兵器库，走下陡峭石梯，进入虫道，也就是连接黑城堡各堡垒和塔楼的地下隧道。去浴室的路不远，在那儿，他先跳入凉水中洗掉一身臭汗，然后泡进温暖的石澡盆。热气稍稍消除了肌肉的酸痛，令他想起临冬城神木林里蒸腾翻滚的温泉。临冬城，他心想，席恩将它焚毁，由我加以重建。这是父亲的希望，罗柏的希望，他们绝不想让城堡成为废墟。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The sound of voices echoing off the vaulted ceiling brought him back to Castle Black. "I don't know," a man was saying, in a voice thick with doubts. "Maybe if I knew the man better… Lord Stannis didn't have much good to say of him, I'll tell you that."</div>

"If we let Stannis choose our Lord Commander, we become his bannermen in all but name. Tywin Lannister is not like to forget that, and you know it will be Lord Tywin who wins in the end. He's already beaten Stannis once, on the Blackwater."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩几时对人有好评价？”没错，是艾里沙爵士冷酷的声音，“若总司令人选得由史坦尼斯决定，那我们除了名义上的权利，岂不都成了他的臣属。泰温·兰尼斯特不可能忘记这点，而我们都清楚泰温公爵才是最后的赢家。在黑水河，他已打败了史坦尼斯。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">You can't be the Lord of Winterfell, you're bastard-born, he heard Robb say again. And the stone kings were growling at him with granite tongues. You do not belong here. This is not your place. When Jon closed his eyes he saw the heart tree, with its pale limbs, red leaves, and solemn face. The weirwood was the heart of Winterfell, Lord Eddard always said… but to save the castle Jon would have to tear that heart up by its ancient roots, and feed it to the red woman's hungry fire god. I have no right, he thought. Winterfell belongs to the old gods.</div>

<div class="line_en">Outside, he found he had no idea where he was going. He walked past the shell of the Lord Commander's Tower, where once he'd saved the Old Bear from a dead man; past the spot where Ygritte had died with that sad smile on her face; past the King's Tower where he and Satin and Deaf Dick Follard had waited for the Magnar and his Thenns; past the heaped and charred remains of the great wooden stair. The inner gate was open, so Jon went down the tunnel, through the Wall. He could feel the cold around him, the weight of all the ice above his head. He walked past the place where Donal Noye and Mag the Mighty had fought and died together, through the new outer gate, and back into the pale cold sunlight.</div>

<div class="line_en">A wind swirled against the Wall, tugging at his cloak. He could feel the cold coming off the ice the way heat comes off a fire. Jon pulled up his hood and began to walk again. The afternoon was growing old, and the sun was low in the west. A hundred yards away was the camp where King Stannis had confined his wildling captives within a ring of ditches, sharpened stakes, and high wooden fences. To his left were three great firepits, where the victors had burned the bodies of all the free folk to die beneath the Wall, huge pelted giants and little Hornfoot men alike. The killing ground was still a desolation of scorched weeds and hardened pitch, but Mance's people had left traces of themselves everywhere; a torn hide that might have been part of a tent, a giant's maul, the wheel of a chariot, a broken spear, a pile of mammoth dung. On the edge of the haunted forest, where the tents had been, Jon found an oakwood stump and sat.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ygritte wanted me to be a wildling. Stannis wants me to be the Lord of Winterfell. But what do I want? The sun crept down the sky to dip behind the Wall where it curved through the western hills. Jon watched as that towering expanse of ice took on the reds and pinks of sunset. Would I sooner be hanged for a tumcloak by Lord Janos, or forswear my vows, marry Val, and become the Lord of Winterfell? It seemed an easy choice when he thought of it in those terms… though if Ygritte had still been alive, it might have been even easier. Val was a stranger to him. She was not hard on the eyes, certainly, and she had been sister to Mance Rayder's queen, but still…</div>

Val would want to keep her sister's son, but we could foster him at Winterfell, and Gilly's boy as well. Sam would never need to tell his lie.

<div class="line_en">It was a long moment before he understood what was happening. When he did, he bolted to his feet. "Ghost?" He turned toward the wood, and there he came, padding silently out of the green dusk, the breath coming warm and white from his open jaws. "Ghost!" he shouted, and the direwolf broke into a run. He was leaner than he had been, but bigger as well, and the only sound he made was the soft crunch of dead leaves beneath his paws. When he reached Jon he leapt, and they wrestled amidst brown grass and long shadows as the stars came out above them. "Gods, wolf, where have you been?" Jon said when Ghost stopped worrying at his forearm. "I thought you'd died on me, like Robb and Ygritte and all the rest. I've had no sense of you, not since I climbed the Wall, not even in dreams." The direwolf had no answer, but he licked Jon's face with a tongue like a wet rasp, and his eyes caught the last light and shone like two great red suns.</div>

He belongs to the old gods, this one. And he alone of all the direwolves was white. Six pups they'd found in the late summer snows, him and Robb; five that were grey and black and brown, for the five Starks, and one white, as white as Snow.</div>

<div class="line_en">The king's men were much in evidence in the yards of Castle Black. They stopped as Jon went by, and gaped at him. None of them had ever seen a direwolf before, he realized, and Ghost was twice as large as the common wolves that prowled their southron greenwoods. As he walked toward the armory, Jon chanced to look up and saw Val standing in her tower window. I'm sorry, he thought. I'm not the man to steal you out of there.</div>

<div class="line_en">Beneath the Wall, the queen's men were kindling their nightfire. He saw Melisandre emerge from the tunnel with the king beside her, to lead the prayers she believed would keep the dark away. "Come, Ghost," Jon told the wolf. "With me. You're hungry, I know.

His brothers crowded the benches and the tables, but more were standing and shouting than were sitting, and no one was eating. There was no food. What's happening here? Lord Janos Slynt was bellowing about tumcloaks and treason, Iron Emmett stood on a table with a naked sword in his fist, Three-Finger Hobb was cursing a ranger from the Shadow Tower… some Eastwatch man slammed his fist onto the table again and again, demanding quiet, but all that did was add to the din echoing off the vaulted ceiling.</div>
