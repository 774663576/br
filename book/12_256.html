<div class="line_en">Disturbed as if out of some gloating dream by his small yell she turned slowly the dreadful malice of her glance upon him. But almost before she was aware that a fury was upon her greater than any she had known in countless years, the shining sword bit upon her foot and shore away the claw. Sam sprang in, inside the arches of her legs, and with a quick upthrust of his other hand stabbed at the clustered eyes upon her lowered head. One great eye went dark.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sam did not wait to wonder what was to be done, or whether he was brave, or loyal, or filled with rage. He sprang forward with a yell, and seized his master's sword in his left hand. Then he charged. No onslaught more fierce was ever seen in the savage world of beasts, where some desperate small creature armed with little teeth, alone, will spring upon a tower of horn and hide that stands above its fallen mate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆没有浪费一分一秒去思考他是勇敢、忠诚还是满腔怒火。他大喊一声跃向前，左手捞起主人的宝剑。然后就义无反顾的往前冲。即使在野兽的世界中也不曾出现过这样狂暴的攻击：一个弱小的生物，只有小得可怜的利牙，竟然敢扑向站在伙伴旁边尖牙利齿、铜皮铁骨的怪兽。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Frodo was lying face upward on the ground and the monster was bending over him, so intent upon her victim that she took no heed of Sam and his cries, until he was close at hand. As he rushed up he saw that Frodo was already bound in cords, wound about him from ankle to shoulder, and the monster with her great forelegs was beginning half to lift, half to drag his body away. On the near side of him lay, gleaming on the ground, his elven-blade, where it had fallen useless from his grasp.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佛罗多面朝下的躺在地上，那怪物正专注的打量她的美食，甚至完全没有理会山姆的哭喊声。直到他逼近身边还浑然不觉。当山姆冲过来的时候，他看见佛罗多已经从头到脚都被绑在蛛网中，那怪物已经开始举起前脚，准备将这顿美食拖到一边去。在他身边则是失去主人使用的精灵利刃，依旧发出蓝色的光芒。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Now the miserable creature was right under her, for the moment out of the reach of her sting and of her claws. Her vast belly was above him with its putrid light, and the stench of it almost smote him down. Still his fury held for one more blow, and before she could sink upon him, smothering him and all his little impudence of courage, he slashed the bright elven-blade across her with desperate strength.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这只可怜的小家伙躲在她的肚子底下，正好躲过了她的毒针和爪牙。她巨大的腹部就正好在他头上发出诡异的微光，浓烈的臭气几乎把山姆压倒到地上。但是，他满腔的怒气依旧可以支撑他再发出一击，在被尸罗压死、或是被毒气窒息之前，他还来得及借着最后一丝勇气，回身一砍，让发亮的精灵利刃切入她的身体。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But Shelob was not as dragons are, no softer spot had she save only her eyes. Knobbed and pitted with corruption was her age-old hide, but ever thickened from within with layer on layer of evil growth. The blade scored it with a dreadful gash, but those hideous folds could not be pierced by any strength of men, not though Elf or Dwarf should forge the steel or the hand of Beren or of Turin wield it. She yielded to the stroke, and then heaved up the great bag of her belly high above Sam's head. Poison frothed and bubbled from the wound. Now splaying her legs she drove her huge bulk down on him again. Too soon. For Sam still stood upon his feet, and dropping his own sword, with both hands he held the elven-blade point upwards, fending off that ghastly roof; and so Shelob, with the driving force of her own cruel will, with strength greater than any warrior's hand, thrust herself upon a bitter spike. Deep, deep it pricked, as Sam was crushed slowly to the ground.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可惜的是，尸罗不是龙，除了她的眼睛之外，她身上没有任何的致命罩门。她一身古老的甲壳长满了各种各样鼓涨的硬瘤，而腹内更是充满了一层又一层由邪恶汁液不断补强，不断累积的血肉。宝剑划开了一道狰狞的伤口，但里面那层层迭迭的血肉却不是任何人类可以破坏的；即使精灵或矮人可以铸造出无比锋利的武器，由远古的神话英雄来攻击，也无法突破这恐怖的防御。她仗着皮粗肉厚，承受了这一击，接着将腹部高举至山姆头上。毒液和恶心的气泡不断的从那伤口涌出。她双腿一伸，准备用那臃肿的腹部压死渺小的山姆。她却没有料到自己的动作太快了。因为，此时的山姆依旧不惧死亡的站着，丢下自己的武器，双手高举刺针，想要用来抵御这以无比威势压下的恶心之物。就这样，尸罗借着自己残酷的意志，和超越任何战士力量的怪力，对着无比锋利的宝剑撞了下去。剑刃深深，深深的刺入了伤口，山姆也被缓缓的压向地面。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sam had fallen to his knees by Frodo's head, his senses reeling in the foul stench, his two hands still gripping the hilt of the sword. Through the mist before his eyes he was aware dimly of Frodo's face, and stubbornly he fought to master himself and to drag himself out of the swoon that was upon him. Slowly he raised his head and saw her, only a few paces away, eyeing him, her beak drabbling a spittle of venom, and a green ooze trickling from below her wounded eye. There she crouched, her shuddering belly splayed upon the ground, the great bows of her legs quivering, as she gathered herself for another spring -- this time to crush and sting to death: no little bite of poison to still the struggling of her meat; this time to slay and then to rend.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆跪了下来，正好倒在佛罗多的脑袋旁边。在那恶臭的笼罩下，他觉得天旋地转，但双手依旧紧握着宝剑。他的双眼一片模糊，只能依稀看见佛罗多的面孔；慢慢的，他靠着强大的意志力，摆脱脑中的昏沉，顽固的想恢复清醒。他缓缓的抬起头，看见她就在几步之外打量着他，嘴角流出滋滋作响的剧毒，绿色的粘液则是从她受伤的眼中不停的涌出。她就趴在那里，将重创的腹部靠着地面，肢体不停的颤抖，准备再度扑向前。这次，她要压碎猎物，用毒液将他毒死；不会再有先用毒液麻痹他的闲暇了──这次要一击毙命，要将他彻底融化。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">No such anguish had Shelob ever known, or dreamed of knowing, in all her long world of wickedness. Not the doughtiest soldier of old Gondor, nor the most savage Orc entrapped, had ever thus endured her, or set blade to her beloved flesh. A shudder went through her. Heaving up again, wrenching away from the pain, she bent her writhing limbs beneath her and sprang backwards in a convulsive leap.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尸罗连作梦都没想过会承受这样剧烈的痛苦，在她漫长的邪恶生命中，这是前所未有的。即使是古老刚铎最骁勇的战士，或是被困住的疯狂半兽人，都不曾这样伤害过她，划破她美丽的血肉。她浑身一阵颤抖，勉力站了起来，将身躯从利刃上拔开，长满钢毛的肢体一弯曲，接着跃向另一个方向。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As if his indomitable spirit had set its potency in motion, the glass blazed suddenly like a white torch in his hand. It flamed like a star that leaping from the firmament sears the dark air with intolerable light. No such terror out of heaven had ever burned in Shelob's face before. The beams of it entered into her wounded head and scored it with unbearable pain, and the dreadful infection of light spread from eye to eye. She fell back beating the air with her forelegs, her sight blasted by inner lightnings, her mind in agony. Then turning her maimed head away, she rolled aside and began to crawl, claw by claw, towards the opening in the dark cliff behind.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Master, dear master," he said, but Frodo did not speak. As he had run forward, eager, rejoicing to be free, Shelob with hideous speed had come behind and with one swift stroke had stung him in the neck. He lay now pale, and heard no voice, and did not move.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“主人，亲爱的主人，”他说，但佛罗多并没有回应。当他兴高采烈，毫无防备的为庆祝重见光明而奔跑时，尸罗用闪电般的速度从后面赶上来，一针刺进了他的脖子。他脸色死白，动也不动的躺在地上，对声音毫无任何反应。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then as quickly as he could he cut away the binding cords and laid his head upon Frodo's breast and to his mouth, but no stir of life could he find, nor feel the faintest flutter of the heart. Often he chafed his master's hands and feet, and touched his brow, but all were cold.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后，他拼尽最后一丝力气，飞快的切开束缚他的蜘蛛丝，将头放在佛罗多的胸口和嘴边，但他什么也听不见。没有心跳，没有生命存在的迹象。他揉搓着主人的手脚，触摸着他的额头，但一切都已经冰冷了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then anger surged over him, and he ran about his master's body in a rage, stabbing the air, and smiting the stones, and shouting challenges. Presently he came back, and bending looked at Frodo's face, pale beneath him in the dusk. And suddenly he saw that he was in the picture that was revealed to him in the mirror of Galadriel in Lórien: Frodo with a pale face lying fast asleep under a great dark cliff. Or fast asleep he had thought then. "He's dead!" he said. "Not asleep, dead!" And as he said it, as if the words had set the venom to its work again, it seemed to him that the hue of the face grew livid green.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后，他被盲目的愤怒所冲击，漫无目的在主人的身体边敲打着石头、挥砍着空气、大声咒骂着。最后，他才恢复了神智，弯下腰去看着佛罗多在暮色中苍白的面孔。突然间，他回想起在凯兰崔尔女皇的镜子中所看见的景象：脸色死白的佛罗多沉睡在一个高大的黑暗悬崖下。当时，他以为他只是睡着了。“他死了！”他悲痛万分的说：“不是睡着了，是死了！”当他话一说出口，似乎这句话点燃了尸罗的魔咒，佛罗多的脸色跟着变成墨绿色。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And then he bent his own neck and put the chain upon it, and at once his head was bowed to the ground with the weight of the Ring, as if a great stone had been strung on him. But slowly, as if the weight became less, or new strength grew in him, he raised his head, and then with a great effort got to his feet and found that he could walk and bear his burden. And for a moment he lifted up the Phial and looked down at his master, and the light burned gently now with the soft radiance of the evening-star in summer, and in that light Frodo's face was fair of hue again, pale but beautiful with an Elvish beauty, as of one who has long passed the shadows.

<div class="line_en">He had not far to go. The tunnel was some way behind; the Cleft a couple of hundred yards ahead, or less. The path was visible in the dusk, a deep rut worn in ages of passage, running now gently up in a long trough with cliffs on either side. The trough narrowed rapidly. Soon Sam came to a long flight of broad shallow steps. Now the orc-tower was right above him, frowning black, and in it the red eye glowed. Now he was hidden in the dark shadow under it. He was coming to the top of the steps and was in the Cleft at last.</div>

At once he was aware that hearing was sharpened while sight was dimmed, but otherwise than in Shelob's lair. All things about him now were not dark but vague; while he himself was there in a grey hazy world, alone, like a small black solid rock, and the Ring, weighing down his left hand, was like an orb of hot gold.

Certainly the Ring had grown greatly in power as it approached the places of its forging; but one thing it did not confer, and that was courage.

His weariness was growing but his will hardened all the more. He thought he could see the light of torches a little way ahead, but try as he would, he could not catch them up. Orcs go fast in tunnels, and this tunnel they knew well; for in spite of Shelob they were forced to use it often as the swiftest way from the Dead City over the mountains. In what far-off time the main tunnel and the great round pit had been made, where Shelob had taken up her abode in ages past, they did not know; but many byways they had themselves delved about it on either side, so as to escape the lair in their goings to and fro on the business of their masters. Tonight they did not intend to go far down, but were hastening to find a side-passage that led back to their watch-tower on the cliff. Most of them were gleeful, delighted with what they had found and seen, and as they ran they gabbled and yammered after the fashion of their kind. Sam heard the noise of their harsh voices, flat and hard in the dead air, and he could distinguish two voices from among all the rest: they were louder, and nearer to him.

Anyway my lads reported that Her Ladyship was having some fun, and that seemed good enough for me, until the message came.

<div class="line_cn" title="“还有他将来会有什么遭遇，”哥巴葛哈哈大笑着说：“如果我们什么都不能做，至少可以告诉他一些故事吓吓他。我想他可能从来没去过美丽的路格柏兹，或许可以先替他做个说明。这会比我想象的还要有趣。走吧！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The voices began to move away. Sam heard the sound of feet receding. He was recovering from his shock, and now a wild fury was on him. "I got it all wrong!" he cried. "I knew I would. Now they've got him, the devils! the filth! Never leave your master, never, never: that was my right rule. And I knew it in my heart. May I be forgiven! Now I've got to get back to him. Somehow, somehow!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那声音开始渐渐远离。山姆可以听见脚步声慢慢变小。他已经从之前的震惊中恢复了过来，现在胸中充满了怒火。“我完全搞错了！”他大喊着：“我就知道会这样。现在，他们把他抓走了，那些恶魔、那些怪物！永远不要离开主人，永远、永远不要，这是我原先的座右铭。我就知道。希望大家能够原谅我！我得要回到他身边。快想想办法，快想想！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"All right! But if I were you, I'd catch the big one that's loose, before you send in any report to Lugbúrz. It won't sound too pretty to say you've caught the kitten and let the cat escape."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧！不过，如果我是你，我在通知路格柏兹之前，会先把那个逃掉的大家伙抓到。如果你跟上级报告说抓到小的，却漏掉大的，这不会好看的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He drew his sword again and beat on the stone with the hilt, but it only gave out a dull sound. The sword, however, blazed so brightly now that he could see dimly in its light. To his surprise he noticed that the great block was shaped like a heavy door, and was less than twice his own height. Above it was a dark blank space between the top and the low arch of the opening. It was probably only meant to be a stop against the intrusion of Shelob, fastened on the inside with some latch or bolt beyond the reach of her cunning. With his remaining strength Sam leaped and caught the top, scrambled up, and dropped; and then he ran madly, sword blazing in hand, round a bend and up a winding tunnel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他再度拔出宝剑，用力的敲着岩壁，但只听的见闷闷的回音。只不过，手中的宝剑现在光芒强到可以照耀四周的环境。他惊讶的发现这岩壁原来是一座沉重的大门，大概约莫有两个他这么高。在洞穴顶端和门边之间还有一段空隙，这多半是用来阻挡尸罗的大门，里面可能用某种门闩之类的东西挡住了，不是他能够从这边打开的。山姆奋力一跃，抓到门边，开始往上爬，翻了进去。然后，他沿着隧道，手中握着闪闪发亮的宝剑，开始发狂似的奔跑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Will he?" said Sam. "You're forgetting the great big Elvish warrior that's loose!" And with that he raced round the last corner, only to find that by some trick of the tunnel, or of the hearing which the Ring gave him, he had misjudged the distance.</div>

<div class="line_en">The news that his master was still alive roused him to a last effort beyond thought of weariness. He could not see anything ahead, for this new passage twisted and turned constantly; but he thought he was catching the two Orcs up: their voices were growing nearer again. Now they seemed quite close.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="主人还活着的消息压住了他的疲倦，激发了最后一丝残存的力气。他眼前什么都看不见，因为这条新的隧道左弯又拐，无法让人一路看到底。但是，他认为自己正缓缓的追上两名半兽人：他们的声音又开始靠近了。这次，似乎比之前更接近。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The two orc-figures were still some way ahead. He could see them now, black and squat against a red glare. The passage ran straight at last, up an incline; and at the end, wide open, were great double doors, leading probably to deep chambers far below the high horn of the tower. Already the Orcs with their burden had passed inside. Gorbag and Shagrat were drawing near the gate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这两个半兽人依旧还在一段距离之外。他现在可以看见他们在火光照耀下的身影。这条隧道最后十分陡峭，却也是笔直的。到了尽头，是两扇敝开的大门，或许是通往塔楼的更深处。哥巴葛和夏格拉正在慢慢的靠近门口。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He's going out of harm's way, I tell you," answered Shagrat. "See? He's precious. I don't trust all my lads, and none of yours; nor you neither, when you're mad for fun. He's going where I want him, and where you won't come, if you don't keep civil. Up to the top, I say. He'll be safe there."</div>
