<div class="line_en">In this September of 1943, Hector Adonis' life was about to change. For southern Italy, the war was over. The American Army had already conquered Sicily and gone on to the mainland. Fascism was dead, Italy was reborn; for the first time in fourteen centuries, the island of Sicily had no real master. But Hector Adonis, knowing the ironies of history, had no great hopes. The Mafia had already begun to usurp the rule of law in Sicily. Their cancerous power would be as deadly as that of any corporate state. From his office window he looked down on the grounds of the University, at the few buildings that could be called a campus.</div>

<div class="line_en">In September of 1943 Hector Adonis was a Professor of History and Literature at the University of Palermo. His extremely short stature caused his colleagues to treat him with less respect than his talents deserved. But this was foreordained in the Sicilian culture, which commonly and brutally based nicknames on physical shortcomings. The one person who knew his true value was the President of the University.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="1943年9月，赫克特·阿多尼斯当上了巴勒莫大学的历史和文学教授。凭他的聪明才智，他本应赢得同事们的尊重，然而由于他身材特别矮小，同事们对他颇为不恭。在西西里的文化中，这是一种必然，因为一个人的绰号通常是残酷地建立在这个人的生理缺陷基础上的。只有这所大学的校长赏识他的真才实学。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Watching from his cathedral-like window he could see the seasonal influx of Mafia chiefs from all the provinces of Sicily, come to make their lobbying calls on the professors of the University. Under Fascist rule, these Mafia chiefs had been more circumspect, more humble, but now under the beneficent rule of American-restored democracy, they had risen like worms struggling through rain-broken earth and resumed their old ways. They were no longer humble.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从那扇教堂式的窗户向下看，他看见西西里各地的黑手党首领们正季节性地来到学校，在老师们中间活动。在法西斯统治时期，这些人都比较谨慎，也比较收敛。现在，美国人恢复了民主的统治，他们就像蠕虫一样挣扎着，从雨水打湿的土壤中钻出来。他们不再低调行事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Mafia chiefs, the Friends of the Friends, heads of small local clans in the many villages of Sicily, came in holiday finery to plead the cause of students who were relatives or sons of wealthy landowners, or sons of friends, who were failing in their courses at the University, who would not get degrees unless some firm action was taken. And these degrees were of the utmost importance. How else would families get rid of sons who had no ambition, no talent, no intelligence? Parents would have to support sons the rest of their lives. But with degrees, slips of parchment from the University, these same rascals could become teachers, doctors, members of Parliament, or if worse came to worst, minor administrative functionaries of the state.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黑手党的首领、友中友，还有西西里众多村落的族长，都盛装来到学校来为一些学生求情。这些学生有的是那些家道殷实的财主的公子哥儿，有的是他们亲朋好友的儿子。这些人的考试成绩不及格，如果不采取得力措施就拿不到学位。学位至关重要，否则这些家庭怎么能把那些没有抱负、没有天分、缺乏聪明才智的儿子扫地出门呢？那样一来，父母亲就要养活他们一辈子。虽然学位只是学校发的一纸文凭，但只要拿到它，这些纨绔子弟就能成为教师、医生、议员，最差的也能在政府部门混个差事干干。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was no need for dormitories, there was no college life as known in England and America. Here most students studied at home and consulted with their professors at stated intervals. The professors gave lectures which students could ignore with impunity. They needed only to take their exams. It was a system that Hector Adonis thought disgraceful in general and stupid in particular as it affected Sicilians, who, he thought, required a pedagogical discipline even more severe than students in other countries.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="宿舍是没有必要的，因为这里没有像美国和英国大学那样的校园生活。这里的学生大多数在家里学习，按规定隔一段时间来向教授请教。教授讲课的时候，学生不听也不会受到惩罚。他们只要参加考试就行。赫克特·阿多尼斯认为这种制度总的来说不光彩而且非常愚蠢，因为它对西西里人造成了很坏的影响，他认为应该用比其他国家更严格的教学规章制度来约束西西里的学生。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Hector Adonis shrugged; history consoled him. His beloved British, in their greatest days of Empire, had entrusted their armies to equally incompetent sons of the rich, whose parents bought them commissions in the army and the commands of great ships. Still the Empire had prospered. True these commanders had led their men to unnecessary slaughters, yet it must be said that the commanders had died with their men, bravery had been an imperative of their class. And that dying had at least solved the problem of incompetent and feckless men becoming a burden to the state. Italians were not so chivalrous or so coldly practical. They loved their children, saved them from personal disasters and let the state look after itself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="赫克特·阿多尼斯无所谓，他从历史中得到了安慰。他喜欢英国人，在大英帝国的鼎盛时期，英国人曾经把军队交给富家的纨绔子弟。这些人的父母花钱给他们在军队中买官，让他们指挥陆军部队或者海军大型舰艇。尽管如此，大英帝国依然兴盛。虽然这些军官率领部下进行过不必要的屠杀，但是必须承认，他们都与自己的部下一起浴血沙场，因为勇敢是这个阶层应尽的职责。像这样死去至少解决了一个问题——不至于让这些无能之辈成为国家的负担。意大利人虽然缺乏骑士精神，但也不是那样冷静务实。他们爱护自己的子女，不让他们经受磨难，把国家的事抛在了脑后。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">From his window, Hector Adonis could spot at least three local Mafia chiefs wandering around looking for their victims. They wore cloth caps and leather boots and carried over their arms heavy velvet jackets, for the weather was still warm. They carried baskets of fruit, bamboo-jacketed bottles of home-grown wine to give as gifts. Not bribes but courteous antidotes for the terror that would rise in the breasts of the professors at the sight of them. For most of the professors were natives of Sicily and understood that the requests could never be refused.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="透过窗户，赫克特·阿多尼斯至少看见三个当地黑手党首领在四处转悠，寻找猎物。他们头戴布帽，脚穿皮靴，由于天气暖和，厚厚的绒外套就搭在手臂上。他们拎着水果篮和竹编套着的家酿葡萄酒当作礼物。这些东西不是用来行贿的，而是用来消除教授们看见他们之后的恐惧心理。因为大多数教授都是西西里人，他们明白这些人的要求是不能拒绝的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Adonis knew the man. His name was Buccilla and he owned a farm and sheep in a town called Partinico, not far from Montelepre. They shook hands and Buccilla handed him the basket he was carrying.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个人阿多尼斯认识，叫布奇拉，家住离蒙特莱普雷不远的小镇帕尔蒂尼科，拥有一个农场和自己的羊群。他们握了握手，布奇拉就把手里的篮子递了过来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One of the Mafia chiefs, in dress so countrified he could have stepped onto the stage of Cavalleria Rusticana, was entering the building and ascending the stairs. Hector Adonis prepared, with sardonic pleasure, to play the familiar comedy to come.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有个黑手党头目走进大楼开始爬楼梯，他那身土气的打扮简直可以上台演《乡村骑士》了。赫克特·阿多尼斯不由感到一阵恶意的愉悦。他准备参演一出熟悉的喜剧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We have so much fruit dropping to the ground and rotting that I thought, I'll carry some to the Professor," Buccilla said. He was a short but broad man, his body powerful from a lifetime of hard work. Adonis knew he had a reputation for honesty, that he was a modest man though he could have turned his power into riches. He was a throwback to the old Mafia chiefs who fought not for riches but for respect and honor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们有很多水果都掉在地上烂掉了，我想还是拿一点来送给教授吧。”布奇拉说。这个人个子不高，肩膀很宽，一辈子从事艰苦的体力劳动，所以身体很壮实。阿多尼斯知道他诚实可靠，为人谦逊，并没有用自己的权力聚敛钱财。他是原始的黑手党人，孜孜以求的不是财富，而是尊重和荣誉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Adonis smiled as he accepted the fruit. What peasant in Sicily ever let anything go to waste? There were a hundred children for each olive that fell to the ground, and these children were like locusts.</div>

<div class="line_en">Buccilla sighed. He was affable, but Adonis knew this affability could turn to menace in the fraction of a second. So he flashed a sympathetic smile as Buccilla said, "What a nuisance life is. I have work to do on my land and yet when my neighbor asked me to do this little favor, how could I refuse? My father knew his father, my grandfather his grandfather. And it is my nature, perhaps my misfortune that I will do anything a friend asks me to do. After all, are we not Christians together?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布奇拉叹了口气。他的样子和蔼可亲，但是阿多尼斯知道，这副模样转眼之间就可能变成威胁和恐吓。所以他同情地微微一笑。布奇拉说：“过日子就是麻烦事不断。我的地里还有活要干，可是我的邻居请我帮个小忙，我怎么好意思拒绝呢？我父亲和他父亲很熟，我祖父跟他祖父也很熟。只要朋友请我帮忙，我都愿意帮，这是我的天性，大概也是我的不幸。话又说回来了，我们不都是基督教徒嘛？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Buccilla stared at him shrewdly. There would be no trouble here. And hadn't he heard somewhere that this professor was one of the Friends? Certainly he did not seem frightened. And if he was a Friend of the Friends, why had not he, Buccilla, known this fact? But there were many different levels in the Friends. In any event, here was a man who understood the world he lived in.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布奇拉精明地盯着他看，觉得这个人不会惹来麻烦。听说这个教授也是友中友，而且他并不害怕自己，可是如果教授和他是一路人，他布奇拉怎么会不知道呢？不过黑手党也分级别的。不管怎么说，眼前这个人是个懂世道的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hector Adonis said smoothly, "We Sicilians are all the same. We are too generous. That is why the northerners in Rome take such a shameful advantage of us."</div>

<div class="line_en">"I have come to ask you a favor," Buccilla said. "As one Sicilian to another. My neighbor's son failed at the University this year. You failed him. So my neighbor claims. But when I heard your name I said to him, 'What! Signor Adonis? Why, that man has the best heart in the world. He could never do such an unkindness if he knew all the facts. Never.' And so they begged me with tears to tell you the whole story. And to ask with the utmost humbleness to change his grade so that he can go into the world to earn his bread."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我来是想请你帮个忙，”布奇拉说，“是西西里人求西西里人。我邻居的儿子今年没能大学毕业。是你让他不及格。这是我邻居说的。我听了你的大名之后，就跟他说：‘什么！阿多尼斯先生？为什么？这可是世界上心肠最好的人哪！如果他知道实际情况，是绝对不会这么狠心的。绝对不会。’所以他们流着眼泪求我把整个事情跟你说说。他们以最卑微的态度请求你修改他的成绩，这样他就可以在这个世界上混碗饭吃了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hector Adonis was not deceived by this exquisite politeness. Again it was like the English he so much admired, those people who could be so subtly rude that you basked in their insults for days before you realized they had mortally wounded you. A figure of speech in regard to the English, but with Signor Buccilla, his request, if denied, would be followed by the blast of a lupara on some dark night. Hector Adonis politely nibbled on the olives and berries in the basket. "Ah, we can't let a young man starve in this terrible world," he said. "What is the fellow's name?" And when Buccilla told him, he took up a ledger from the bottom of his desk. He leafed through it, though of course he knew the name well.</div>

<div class="line_en">The failed student was a lout, an oaf, a lummox; more a brute than the sheep on Buccilla's farm. He was a lazy womanizer, a shiftless braggart, a hopeless illiterate who did not know the difference between the Iliad and Verga. Despite all this, Hector Adonis smiled sweetly at Buccilla and in a tone of the utmost surprise said, "Ah, he had a little trouble with one of his examinations. But it is easily put to order. Have him come see me and I will prepare him in these very rooms and then give him an extra examination. He will not fail again."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个不及格的家伙是一个笨蛋、一个蠢材、一块朽木；他还不如布奇拉农场里的一只羊，是个人面兽心的家伙。他生性懒惰，玩弄女性，得过且过，喜欢吹牛，是个不可救药的白痴，连《伊利亚特》和维尔加都分不清。尽管如此，赫克特·阿多尼斯还是对布奇拉客客气气地笑了笑，以非常惊讶的语调说：“啊，他的确有一门考试有点麻烦。不过改一下并不困难。让他来见我，我在这里的房间里教教他，然后让他补考一次。他不会不及格的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They shook hands, and the man left. Another friend made, Hector thought. What did it signify that all these young good-for-nothings got University degrees they did not earn or deserve? In the Italy of 1943 they could use them to wipe their pampered asses and decline into positions of mediocrity.</div>

<div class="line_en">The ringing phone broke his train of thought and brought a different irritation. There was a short ring, then a pause before three curler rings.

<div class="line_en">Don Croce said amiably without a hint of sarcasm, "I'm illiterate myself, yet no one can say I have been unsuccessful in the world of business." Certainly, Hector Adonis thought, a man who could bribe ministers, order murders, terrify shopkeepers and factory owners did not have to read and write. Don Croce continued, "I found my path by experience. Why could not my nephew do the same? My poor sister will be heartbroken if her son does not have the word 'Doctor' in front of his name. She is a true believer in Christ, she wants to help the world."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="唐·克罗切说：“我是个大老粗，可是没人否认我事业有成。”他的语气和蔼可亲，丝毫没有讽刺挖苦。赫克特·阿多尼斯心想，当然啦，一个可以贿赂部长、下令杀人、恫吓店主和厂主的人是不必看书写字的。唐·克罗切继续说道：“我是凭经验摸索自己的道路。我外甥为什么不能这样呢？如果我外甥的名字后面不能加上医生两个字，我那可怜的妹妹心都会碎的。她是个虔诚的基督徒。她愿意帮助这个世界。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Don Croce sighed. He said cajolingly, "What harm can my nephew do? I will arrange a government post with the army, or with a Catholic hospital for the aged. He will hold their hands and listen to their troubles. He is extremely amiable, he will charm the old wrecks. What do I ask? A little shuffling of the papers you shuffle here." He glanced around the room, contemptuous of the books that formed its walls.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="唐·克罗切叹了口气，假意说道：“我外甥能干出什么坏事啊？我可以在部队为他谋一个公务，或者为他在天主教老年医院安排一项工作。他会抓住那些老人的手，倾听他们诉说自己的烦恼。他这个人特别温柔，老人们会觉得很亲切。我的要求是什么呢？不过是请你们在这堆乱糟糟的文件中做一点小小的改动。”他扫视了办公室一眼，对靠墙摆放的书籍表现出不屑一顾的神情。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Despite his birth in Palermo, Doctor Nattore did not look Sicilian. He was fair and balding and he showed his anger, something no true Sicilian would ever do in this delicate situation. Doubtless it was the defective genes inherited from some long-ago Norman conqueror. "You don't understand, my dear Professor Adonis. The young fool wants to be a surgeon."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="纳托尔博士出生在巴勒莫，但他长得并不像西西里人。他头发浅黄，有点谢顶，而且一生气就摆在脸上。在这种微妙的情况下，真正的西西里人是绝对不会这样的。毫无疑问，这是从古代诺曼征服者的基因中继承的缺陷。“你不明白，我亲爱的阿多尼斯教授。这个年轻的傻瓜想当一名外科医生。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hector Adonis, extremely disturbed by this meekness of Don Croce, a danger signal in such a man, thought angrily that it was easy for the Don to take such a position. His men immediately shipped him to Switzerland at the slightest indisposition of his liver. But Adonis knew it was up to him to solve this impasse. "My dear Doctor Nattore," he said, "surely we can do something. A little private tutoring, extra training at a charity hospital?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="赫克特·阿多尼斯感到极度不安，因为这种温和态度是一个危险信号。他很恼火地想，唐当然觉得任何事都轻而易举了，假如他的肝脏稍有不适，手下人会立即送他去瑞士。但是赫克特·阿多尼斯知道这个僵局得靠他解决。“我亲爱的纳托尔博士，”他说道，“我们肯定能够想点儿办法。是不是给他一点个别辅导，或者让他到一家慈善医院去接受一段时间的训练？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Taking advantage of the stunned silence on his colleague's face, Doctor Nattore went on. "Your nephew knows nothing about anatomy. He hacked a cadaver to pieces as if he were carving a sheep for the spit. He misses most of his classes, he does not prepare for his test papers, he enters the operating room as if he were going to a dance. I admit he is amiable, you couldn't find a nicer chap. But, after all, we are talking about a man who will someday have to enter a human body with a sharp knife."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="见自己的同事惊得哑口无言，纳托尔博士趁势说：“你的外甥对解剖学一窍不通，他把解剖用的尸体大卸八块儿，就像把一只羊切开做烤羊肉一样。他大部分时间都不来上课，考试前也不作任何准备，他进手术室就像是去跳舞似的。我承认他很温和，你找不到比他更温和的人了，但问题是他将来得用锋利的手术刀给病人开刀。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Hector Adonis knew exactly what Don Croce was thinking. Who cared how bad a surgeon the boy would make? It was a matter of family prestige, the loss of respect if the boy failed. No matter how bad a surgeon, he would never kill as many as Don Croce's more busy employees. Also, this young Doctor Nattore had not bent to his will, not taken the hint, that Don Croce was willing to let the surgeon business go by, that he was willing for his nephew to be a medical doctor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="赫克特·阿多尼斯知道此刻的唐·克罗切在想什么：这孩子将来是不是蹩脚的外科医生不关我的事！这是个事关家族荣誉的问题，如果当不了医生，就会失去别人的尊敬。即便他是个不合格的外科医生，杀死的人也不会比唐·克罗切的手下杀的人多。还有，这个年轻的纳托尔博士没有屈从他的意愿，也没有领会他的暗示——当不成外科医生唐·克罗切并不在意，当个普通医生也行。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So now it was time for Hector Adonis to settle the issue. "My dear Don Croce," he said, "I am sure that Doctor Nattore will accede to your wishes if we continue to persuade him. But why this romantic idea of your nephew to be a surgeon? As you say, he's too amiable, and surgeons are born sadists. And who in Sicily voluntarily goes under the knife?" He paused for a moment. Then he went on. "Also he must train in Rome, if we pass him here, and the Romans will use any excuse to demolish a Sicilian. You do your nephew a disservice to insist. Let me propose a compromise."</div>

<div class="line_en">Doctor Nattore muttered that no compromise was possible. For the first time the lizardlike eyes of Don Croce flashed fire. Doctor Nattore fell silent and Hector Adonis rushed on. "Your nephew will receive passing marks to become a doctor, not a surgeon. We will say he has too kind a heart to cut."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="纳托尔博士低声嘟囔说不可能妥协。唐·克罗切蜥蜴般的眼睛里第一次露出凶光。纳托尔博士不吭气了，于是赫克特·阿多尼斯赶紧打圆场说：“你的外甥会得到一个及格的分数，他可以去当医生，但不能当外科医生。我们就说他心太软，不适合动刀子。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Don Croce spread wide his arms, his lips parted in a cold smile. "You have defeated me with your good sense and your reasonableness," he said to Adonis. "So be it. My nephew will be a doctor, not a surgeon. And my sister must be content." He made haste to leave them, his real purpose achieved; he had not hoped for more. The President of the University escorted him down to the car. But everyone in that room noted the last glance Don Croce gave Doctor Nattore before he left. It was a glance of the closest scrutiny as if he were memorizing the features, to make sure that he did not forget the face of this man who had tried to thwart his will.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="唐·克罗切摊开双手，嘴唇动了动，露出一丝冷笑。“你的好意和理智说服了我，”他对阿多尼斯说，“那就这样吧。我外甥就当个普通医生，不当外科医生了，我妹妹该知足了。”他匆匆告辞，因为他的主要目的已达到；他没有提更多的要求。校长陪同他下楼，把他送上车。房间里的每个人都注意到克罗切临走前投向纳托尔博士的目光。这一眼看得非常仔细，好像要记住他的相貌特征，免得忘了这张试图违背他意愿的脸。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That evening Hector Adonis was host to six professors, including Doctor Nattore, at one of Palermo's best restaurants. Each of these professors had received a visit from a "man of honor" that day and each had agreed to change the marks of a failing pupil. Doctor Nattore listened to their stories with horror and then finally said, "But that cannot be in a medical school, not a doctor," until finally they lost their temper with him. A Professor of Philosophy demanded to know why the practice of medicine was more important to the human race than the intricate thought processes of the human mind and the immortal sanctity of one's soul. When they were finished Doctor Nattore agreed to leave the University of Palermo and emigrate to Brazil, where, he was assured by his colleagues, a good surgeon could make his fortune in gall bladders.</div>
