<div class="line_en">The wages were paid once a month by the secretary. On pay-day each batch of assistants, coming down from tea, went into the passage and joined the long line of people waiting orderly like the audience in a queue outside a gallery door. One by one they entered the office. The secretary sat at a desk with wooden bowls of money in front of him, and he asked the employe's name; he referred to a book, quickly, after a suspicious glance at the assistant, said aloud the sum due, and taking money out of the bowl counted it into his hand.</div>

<div class="line_en">The assistant passed on to the second secretary and before leaving the room paid him four shillings for washing money, two shillings for the club, and any fines that he might have incurred. With what he had left he went back into his department and there waited till it was time to go. Most of the men in Philip's house were in debt with the woman who sold the sandwiches they generally ate for supper. She was a funny old thing, very fat, with a broad, red face, and black hair plastered neatly on each side of the forehead in the fashion shown in early pictures of Queen Victoria. She always wore a little black bonnet and a white apron; her sleeves were tucked up to the elbow; she cut the sandwiches with large, dirty, greasy hands; and there was grease on her bodice, grease on her apron, grease on her skirt. She was called Mrs. Fletcher, but everyone addressed her as `Ma'; she was really fond of the shop assistants, whom she called her boys; she never minded giving credit towards the end of the month, and it was known that now and then she had lent someone or other a few shillings when he was in straits. She was a good woman. When they were leaving or when they came back from the holidays, the boys kissed her fat red cheek; and more than one, dismissed and unable to find another job, had got for nothing food to keep body and soul together. The boys were sensible of her large heart and repaid her with genuine affection. There was a story they liked to tell of a man who had done well for himself at Bradford, and had five shops of his own, and had come back after fifteen years and visited Ma Fletcher and given her a gold watch.</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip found himself with eighteen shillings left out of his month's pay. It was the first money he had ever earned in his life. It gave him none of the pride which might have been expected, but merely a feeling of dismay. The smallness of the sum emphasised the hopelessness of his position. He took fifteen shillings to Mrs. Athelny to pay back part of what he owed her, but she would not take more than half a sovereign.</div>

<div class="line_en">Athelny kept on saying that he would speak to the manager about Philip, it was absurd that no use should be made of his talents; but he did nothing, and Philip soon came to the conclusion that the press-agent was not a person of so much importance in the manager's eyes as in his own.

<div class="line_en">It was evident that Athelny would. It was interesting to see the ascendency which the uneducated woman, bound to him by no legal tie, had acquired over the brilliant, unstable man. Mrs. Athelny treated Philip with motherly kindness now that he was in a different position, and he was touched by her anxiety that he should make a good meal. It was the solace of his life (and when he grew used to it, the monotony of it was what chiefly appalled him) that he could go every Sunday to that friendly house. It was a joy to sit in the stately Spanish chairs and discuss all manner of things with Athelny. Though his condition seemed so desperate he never left him to go back to Harrington Street without a feeling of exultation. At first Philip, in order not to forget what he had learned, tried to go on reading his medical books, but he found it useless; he could not fix his attention on them after the exhausting work of the day; and it seemed hopeless to continue working when he did not know in how long he would be able to go back to the hospital. He dreamed constantly that he was in the wards. The awakening was painful. The sensation of other people sleeping in the room was inexpressibly irksome to him; he had been used to solitude, and to be with others always, never to be by himself for an instant was at these moments horrible to him. It was then that he found it most difficult to combat his despair. He saw himself going on with that life, first to the right, second on the left, madam, indefinitely; and having to be thankful if he was not sent away: the men who had gone to the war would be coming home soon, the firm had guaranteed to take them back, and this must mean that others would be sacked; he would have to stir himself even to keep the wretched post he had.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="毫无疑问，阿西尔尼是不会辞职的。看着这样一个大字不识，甚至在法律上和阿西尔尼一点关系都没有的女人能把个聪明绝顶、不甘安顿的男人管得服服帖帖，倒真叫人觉得有点儿意思。菲利普坠入谷底后，阿西尔尼太太像慈母一般照顾着他，总想给他做顿好饭吃，这让他心里很感动。他已经习惯了现在的日子，最怕的就是那日复一日的单调。每个礼拜天去那所热情友好的房子里做客已经成了他生活中的慰藉和依靠。坐在宽大的西班牙椅子上和阿西尔尼天南海北地胡侃一通是多么快乐的事。虽然他近来过得很苦，可没有一次离开那所房子时心里不是欣喜若狂的。一开始，菲利普害怕忘了自己在医院学到的知识，每天下班回家后还要继续温习课本。可他很快就发现这只是无用功。一天的辛苦过后，他的精力根本无法集中到课本上。况且在还不知道何时能重回医院的情况下，继续学习也没什么用。他时常做梦，梦到自己又回到病房巡视。醒来的那一刻，一切如旧，最是痛苦。他能感受到屋里还有别人在沉沉睡着，这种感觉让人心烦意乱，无法言喻。他已经孤独惯了，像这样二十四小时老有别人在身边，有时会让他觉得非常可怕。他现在才发现，对抗自己的绝望是最困难的事。未来的日子会怎样，现在已一目了然：他将一遍遍重复着那句“先往右走，再左拐，太太”，永无结束之日。不过，能有份这样的工作也要谢天谢地了。那些奔赴战场的男人马上就要回来，公司承诺给他们保留职位，到时候一定会裁下一批人。就算要保住这口破饭碗，他还得咬牙努力才行。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was only one thing to free him and that was the death of his uncle. He would get a few hundred pounds then, and on this he could finish his course at the hospital. Philip began to wish with all his might for the old man's death. He reckoned out how long he could possibly live: he was well over seventy, Philip did not know his exact age, but he must be at least seventy-five; he suffered from chronic bronchitis and every winter had a bad cough. Though he knew them by heart Philip read over and over again the details in his text-book of medicine of chronic bronchitis in the old. A severe winter might be too much for the old man. With all his heart Philip longed for cold and rain. He thought of it constantly, so that it became a monomania. Uncle William was affected by the great heat too, and in August they had three weeks of sweltering weather. Philip imagined to himself that one day perhaps a telegram would come saying that the Vicar had died suddenly, and he pictured to himself his unutterable relief. As he stood at the top of the stairs and directed people to the departments they wanted, he occupied his mind with thinking incessantly what he would do with the money. He did not know how much it would be, perhaps no more than five hundred pounds, but even that would be enough. He would leave the shop at once, he would not bother to give notice, he would pack his box and go without saying a word to anybody; and then he would return to the hospital. That was the first thing. Would he have forgotten much? In six months he could get it all back, and then he would take his three examinations as soon as he could, midwifery first, then medicine and surgery. The awful fear seized him that his uncle, notwithstanding his promises, might leave everything he had to the parish or the church. The thought made Philip sick. He could not be so cruel. But if that happened Philip was quite determined what to do, he would not go on in that way indefinitely; his life was only tolerable because he could look forward to something better. If he had no hope he would have no fear. The only brave thing to do then would be to commit suicide, and, thinking this over too, Philip decided minutely what painless drug he would take and how he would get hold of it. It encouraged him to think that, if things became unendurable, he had at all events a way out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="时下只剩一件事能让他获得解放，那就是伯伯的死。到那时，菲利普就能继承几百英镑，足够他从医学院毕业。菲利普开始全心全意地盼着伯伯早点死。他计算着还要多久这个老东西才能咽气。他已经七十多岁，虽然不确定到底多大，但至少应该是七十五了。他有严重的慢性支气管炎，每年冬天都咳嗽得厉害。尽管菲利普早把关于支气管炎的知识背熟了，可还是反复翻看课本，研究得了这个病的老年人会出现什么症状。一个严寒的冬天想必就够这老东西受的了。菲利普希望天气更冷一点，多下几场雨。他天天想，日日盼，到头来竟变得有些偏执。天气太热对伯伯的身体也不好。每年八月，布莱克斯塔布尔的天气都闷热难耐。菲利普想象着哪天一封电报打来，说牧师已经忽然离世了，那种轻松痛快的感觉真是无法用语言来形容！他站在商场的楼梯口给顾客指着路，满脑子想的都是得到遗产后要做些什么。他不知道这笔遗产能有多少，也许不过五百英镑，但就算这样也足够了。他要立刻离开这家商场，连辞职信都不交，回去收拾好行李，一言不发，拔腿就走。首先要做的，就是回医院继续学习。之前的知识忘了多少？最多六个月肯定都能补回来。然后就要尽快完成那三次考试，先考产科学，再来内科和外科。忽然，他后背一阵发凉：万一伯伯违背诺言，把所有东西都捐给教区或者教堂怎么办？这个念头让菲利普毛骨悚然。他不会这么铁石心肠的。如果事情真到了这一步，菲利普也自有主意，知道自己下一步该怎么安排。他绝不这样苟且活下去。没有个乐观的前景，活着还有什么意义？一旦希望尽失，恐惧也会随之消逝。到那时，唯一勇敢的做法就是自杀。菲利普左思右想，谨慎思考哪种药吃下去痛苦最少，以及怎么才能把药搞到手。就算最坏的情况发生，他也已经想好了出路。想到这点，心里便宽慰了许多。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Once a month, for a week, Philip was `on duty.' He had to go to the department at seven in the morning and keep an eye on the sweepers. When they finished he had to take the sheets off the cases and the models. Then, in the evening when the assistants left, he had to put back the sheets on the models and the cases and `gang' the sweepers again. It was a dusty, dirty job. He was not allowed to read or write or smoke, but just had to walk about, and the time hung heavily on his hands. When he went off at half past nine he had supper given him, and this was the only consolation; for tea at five o'clock had left him with a healthy appetite, and the bread and cheese, the abundant cocoa which the firm provided, were welcome.</div>

The manager, happening to notice the costume window as he came in, had sent for the buyer and made satirical remarks upon the colour scheme. Forced to submit in silence to his superior's sarcasm, Mr. Sampson took it out of the assistants; and he rated the wretched fellow whose duty it was to dress the window.</div>

<div class="line_en">He went into his office, muttering angrily. Philip's heart sank. When Friday morning came he went into the window with a sickening sense of shame. His cheeks were burning. It was horrible to display himself to the passers-by, and though he told himself it was foolish to give way to such a feeling he turned his back to the street. There was not much chance that any of the students at the hospital would pass along Oxford Street at that hour, and he knew hardly anyone else in London; but as Philip worked, with a huge lump in his throat, he fancied that on turning round he would catch the eye of some man he knew. He made all the haste he could. By the simple observation that all reds went together, and by spacing the costumes more than was usual, Philip got a very good effect; and when the buyer went into the street to look at the result he was obviously pleased.</div>
