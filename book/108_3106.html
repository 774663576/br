<div class="line_en">For almost twenty minutes, Ove sits in the driver's seat of the Saab with the garage door open. For the first five minutes the cat stares at him impatiently from the passenger seat. During the next five it begins to look properly worried. In the end it tries to open the door itself; when this fails, it promptly lies down on the seat and goes to sleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有二十分钟，欧维敞着车库大门坐在萨博的前座上。头五分钟，猫咪坐在副驾驶座上不耐烦地瞅着欧维，就像在想是不是该有谁来揪一下他的耳朵。紧接着的五分钟，它转而为此担忧起来。有那么个片刻，它想试着自己开门。未遂之后，它只好往座位上一瘫，睡起觉来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ove glances at it as it rolls onto its side and starts snoring. He has to concede that the Cat Annoyance has a very direct approach to problem-solving.</div>

<div class="line_en">He looks out over the parking area again at the garage opposite. He must have stood out there with Rune a hundred times. They were friends once. Ove can't think of very many people in his life he could describe as such. Ove and Ove's wife were the first people to move into this street of row houses all those years ago, when it had only recently been built and was still surrounded by trees. That same day, Rune and Rune's wife moved in. Anita was also pregnant and, of course, immediately became best friends with Ove's wife in that way only women knew how. And just like all women who become best friends they both had the idea that Rune and Ove had to become best friends. Because they had so many "interests in common." Ove couldn't really understand what they meant by that. After all, Rune drove a Volvo.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他又抬头看看停车场，看看对面的车库。他和鲁尼一起站在那儿，少说也有几百回了。他们曾经是朋友。欧维记忆中，没有多少人能以朋友相称。很久很久以前，欧维和太太是第一对搬进这个排屋住宅区的住户。那时房子是新盖的，周围的一切还只是树。第二天，鲁尼和安妮塔也搬了来。安妮塔怀孕后，当然立刻成了欧维太太最要好的朋友，这种友谊只会建立在女人之间。而就像所有成为挚友的女人一样，她们俩当然都认为鲁尼和欧维也应该成为朋友。毕竟他们有那么多“共同爱好”。欧维根本搞不懂这话是什么意思。鲁尼明明是开沃尔沃的。">查看中文翻译</div>

</div>
<div class="line_en">Not that Ove exactly had anything against Rune apart from that. He had a proper job and he didn't talk more than he had to. Admittedly he did drive that Volvo but, as Ove's wife kept insisting, this did not necessarily make a person immoral. So Ove put up with him. After a period he even lent him tools. And one afternoon, standing in the parking area, thumbs tucked into their belts, they got caught up in a conversation about lawn mower prices. When they parted they shook hands. As if the mutual decision to become friends was a business agreement.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="也并不是欧维有什么特别反感鲁尼的地方。他有一份正当工作，也不多嘴多舌。诚然他是开沃尔沃的，但就像欧维太太反复强调的那样，也不能光因为这个就把人当成十足的傻逼，所以欧维还时不时会和他站一块儿。不久之后，他甚至开始借给他工具。一天下午，他们拇指插进皮带站在停车场上，讨论起割草机的价钱来，分别时还握了握手，就好像交朋友和做买卖谈生意是一回事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When the two men later found out that all sorts of people were moving into the area, they sat down in Ove and Sonja's kitchen for consultations. By the time they emerged from these, they had established a shared framework of rules, signs clarifying what was permitted or not, and a newly setup steering group for the Residents' Association. Ove was the chairman; Rune, the vice chairman.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当两个男人同时听说，很快形形色色的人就要住进其余四栋排屋的时候，他们就聚到欧维和索雅的厨房开会商议。走出厨房，他们已经为小区设立了各种规章制度，竖起各种标示牌，还成立了社区公共管理委员会。欧维担任会长，鲁尼任副会长。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the months that followed they went to the dump together. Grumbled at people who had parked their cars incorrectly. Bargained for better deals on paint and drainpipes at the hardware store, stood on either side of the man from the telephone company when he came to install telephones and jacks, brusquely pointing out where and how he should best go about it. Not that either of them knew exactly how telephone cables should be installed, but they were both well versed in keeping an eye on whippersnappers like this one, to stop them pulling a fast one. That was all there was to it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="之后的一个月，他们俩一起赴汤蹈火。一起痛骂停错车的人；一起在五金店里为外墙漆和落水管讨价还价；电话公司派人来排线装机的时候，两人在排线员身旁各站一边，对着他一通指手画脚。并非是谁知道电话线应该怎么装，但他们俩都很清楚，头脑清醒的人是不会任由这样的愣头青忽悠的。事情就是这样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sometimes the two couples had dinner together. Insofar as one could have dinner when Ove and Rune mostly just stood about in the parking area the whole evening, kicking the tires of their cars and comparing their load capacity, turning radius, and other significant matters. And that was all there was to it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两对夫妇有时也一起吃晚饭。其实晚饭的大部分时间，欧维和鲁尼站在停车场上踹踹各自汽车的轮胎，比较装载能力、转弯半径和其他技术指标，也算是共度时光吧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sonja's and Anita's bellies kept growing steadily, which, according to Rune, made Anita "doolally in the brain." Apparently he had to look for the coffeepot in the fridge more or less daily once she was in her third month. Sonja, not to be outdone, developed a temper that could flare up quicker than a pair of saloon doors in a John Wayne film, which made Ove reluctant to open his mouth at all. This, of course, gave further cause for irritation. When she wasn't breaking out in a sweat she was freezing. And as soon as Ove tired of arguing with her and agreed to turn up the radiators by a half step she started sweating again, and he had to run around and turn them back down again. She also ate bananas in such quantities that the people at the supermarket must have thought Ove had started a zoo.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="索雅和安妮塔的肚子越来越大，据鲁尼说来，这让安妮塔“一孕傻三年”。她三个月身孕的时候，他就几乎得每天去冰箱里找咖啡壶。与此同时，索雅培养出了比约翰·韦恩2西部片里的牛仔们更火爆的脾气，以至于欧维干脆闭嘴不言。当然，这样让她更恼火。而且，只要她不出汗，她就觉得冻坏了。一番争执后，欧维才和她达成协议，要把暖气调高半挡，她就又开始出汗，他只好满屋子转，把暖气再调下来。她还吃很多香蕉，让食品店的柜员误以为欧维开了个动物园。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The hormones are on the warpath," Rune said with an insightful nod during one of the nights when he and Ove sat in the outside space behind his house, while the women kept to Sonja and Ove's kitchen, talking about whatever it is women talk about.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the evenings, Sonja played music for her belly, because she said it made the child move. Ove mostly just sat in his armchair on the other side of the room and pretended to be watching television while she was doing it. In his innermost thoughts he was worried about what it would be like once the child finally decided to come out. What if, for example, the kid disliked Ove because Ove wasn't so fond of music?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="晚上索雅会给肚子里的婴儿放音乐，她说这样宝宝就会动。每当此时，欧维总是将信将疑地坐到房间另一端假装看电视。他其实暗自担心这孩子出来的时候究竟会怎样。比方说，要是因为欧维对音乐不怎么感兴趣而不被喜欢怎么办。">查看中文翻译</div>

</div>
<div class="line_en">It wasn't that Ove was afraid. He just didn't know how to prepare himself for fatherhood. He had asked for some sort of manual but Sonja had just laughed at him. Ove didn't understand why. There were manuals for everything else.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维也不是害怕，而是他不知道该如何为成为爸爸作准备。他曾问有没有这方面的说明书，但只是换来了索雅的嘲笑。欧维不明白为什么。什么东西不都有个说明书吗。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was doubtful about whether he'd be any good at being someone's dad. He didn't like children an awful lot. He hadn't even been very good at being a child. Sonja thought he should talk to Rune about it because they were "in the same situation." Ove couldn't quite understand what she meant by that. Rune was not in fact going to be the father of Ove's child, but of an altogether different one. At least Rune agreed with Ove about the point of not having much to discuss, and that was something. So when Anita came over in the evenings and sat in the kitchen with Sonja, talking about the aches and pains and all those things, Ove and Rune made the excuse of having "things" to talk about and went out to Ove's shed and just stood there in silence, picking at various bits on Ove's workbench.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他很怀疑自己能不能胜任做父亲。他其实不怎么喜欢孩子，他自己都不怎么擅长做个好孩子。索雅认为，他应该和鲁尼谈谈，毕竟他们俩现在算是“同舟共济”。欧维根本不理解她这话的意思，鲁尼又不是要当欧维家孩子的爸爸，他有自己的孩子，不是吗。但至少鲁尼好像也同意，他们其实没什么好讨论的，这就很说明问题。所以每当晚上安妮塔来找索雅，两个人坐在厨房里有一茬没一茬地聊天时，欧维和鲁尼就借口“有事商量”，跑去欧维的储藏室里，沉默地站在工作台那儿瞎倒腾。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Standing there next to each other behind a closed door for the third night running without knowing what they were supposed to do with themselves, they agreed that they needed to get busy with something before, as Rune put it, "the new neighbors start thinking there's some sort of monkey business going on in here."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在关着门无所事事地肩并肩连续站了三个晚上之后，他们达成共识，需要找些事来消磨时间，不然的话，正如鲁尼所说：“那些新邻居得开始怀疑这儿搞什么鬼名堂呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We can sand it down and repaint it pink if we get a girl," mumbled Ove when he showed it to Sonja.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“如果是个女孩，可以重新刷成粉红的。”索雅看到床的时候，欧维在她耳边嘀咕。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sonja put her arms around him, and he felt his neck getting all wet with her tears. Completely irrational hormones.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="索雅双臂环抱住他，他感觉出脖子被她的眼泪打湿。据说这是毫无理智的荷尔蒙在作祟。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ove agreed that it might be best to do as he said. And so it was. They didn't talk much while they were doing it, but they helped each other with the drawings and measuring the angles and ensuring that the corners were straight and properly done. And late one evening when Anita and Sonja were in the fourth month, two light blue cribs were installed in the prepared nurseries of their row houses.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维说这样最好，于是就开工了。他们干活儿的时候不怎么交谈，但绘图、测量角度以及确认横平竖直的时候，会互相搭把手。就这样，某天夜晚，安妮塔和索雅四个月身孕时，两家排屋的婴儿房里同时出现了一张天蓝色婴儿床。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I want you to ask me to be your wife," she whispered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我要你向我求婚。”她低声说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And so it was. They married in the Town Hall, very simply. Neither of them had any family, so only Rune and Anita came. Sonja and Ove put on their rings and then all four of them went to a restaurant. Ove paid but Rune helped check the bill to make sure it "had been done properly." Of course it hadn't. So after conferring with the waiter for about an hour, the two men managed to convince him it would be easier for him if he halved the bill or they'd "report him." Obviously it was a bit hazy exactly who would report whom for what, but eventually, with a certain amount of swearing and arm-waving, the waiter gave up and went into the kitchen and wrote them a new bill. In the meantime Rune and Ove nodded grimly at one another without noticing that their wives, as usual, had taken a taxi home twenty minutes earlier.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="顺理成章，他们在市政厅完婚，一切从简。俩人都没有什么家人，所以只来了鲁尼和安妮塔。索雅和欧维互相交换了戒指，然后他们四人一起去饭店吃了顿好的。欧维付的钱，鲁尼对的账，确保“分文不差”，结果当然是“差”了点儿。于是交涉了超过半小时之后，两个男人终于说服侍者：要么他自觉把账单打个对折，要么他们就“举报”他。当然向谁举报什么还不清楚，但最后侍者还是举手投降，骂骂咧咧地进厨房重新打了张账单。鲁尼和欧维满意地互相点头，完全没有注意到他们的太太早在二十分钟前就打车回家了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Suddenly an unknown woman, clearly the owner of the unfamiliar voice, has stuck her head into the garage. She's about forty-five, wearing tatty jeans and a green windbreaker that looks too large for her. She doesn't have any makeup on and her hair is in a ponytail. The woman blunders into his garage and looks around with interest. The cat steps forward and gives her a threatening hiss. She stops. Ove puts his hands in his pockets.</div>

<div class="line_en">He hangs his arm out the window and flicks the ash against the wing mirror of the Škoda.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他从窗口伸出手，冲着斯柯达的后视镜弹烟灰。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What are you doing here?" Ove blurts out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你来这儿干什么？”欧维反问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He puts the cigarette he's shaken out in his mouth and lights it. Ove breathes so heavily that his chest is pumping up and down under his jacket. The woman gathers up her papers and files and adjusts her glasses. The man just sighs, as if Ove is a cheeky child refusing to stop riding his skateboard on the sidewalk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他把敲出的烟叼进嘴里点燃。欧维喘着粗气，胸膛在外套下起伏。副驾驶座上的女人收拾起文件，扶正眼镜。穿白衬衫的男人叹了口气，就像欧维是个淘气的孩子，非要在人行道上玩滑板。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Would you be kind enough to get out of the way?" he asks Ove.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你能不能别挡道？”他对欧维说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes," says the man, nodding indifferently.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的。”穿白衬衫的男人满不在乎地点点头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You know what I'm doing here. We're taking Rune, in the house at the end of the road, into care."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你知道我们来干吗？我们来接最后一栋房子里的鲁尼。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Taking him into care?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“照顾他？”欧维大声问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The man in the white shirt looks at the woman in the passenger seat and smiles resignedly. Then he turns to Ove again and speaks very slowly. As if otherwise Ove might not understand his words.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="穿白衬衫的男人看看副驾驶座上戴眼镜的女人，无奈地笑笑。然后转向欧维，非常缓慢地开了口，就好像不这样欧维就听不懂：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And if Anita doesn't want that?" Ove hisses, tapping his index finger against the roof of the car.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“要是安妮塔不愿意呢？”欧维厉声问，并用食指敲敲车顶。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That's nothing for you to worry yourself about," says the man in the white shirt in a monotone voice, as if he's a computer-generated voice mail message letting Ove know that he's been placed in a telephone line.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这不用你操心。”穿白衬衫的男人回答，就好像他是个电脑发声的语音提示，提醒欧维他拨打的电话无法接通。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's not up to Anita to make that decision. It's up to the investigation team."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“由不得安妮塔。这是由调研组决定的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ove's breathing becomes even more strained. He can feel his pulse in his throat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维呼吸越来越困难。他感觉到脖子上的脉动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You're not bringing this car into this area," he says through gritted teeth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你不能在小区里开车。”他咬紧牙说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As if everything Ove had said was nothing more than the inarticulate raving of a senile old man.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就好像欧维所说的一切不过是老年人的胡言乱语。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His fists are clenched. His tone is pointed and threatening. But his opponent looks quite calm. He puts out the cigarette against the paintwork of the door and drops it on the ground.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拳头紧握。语气逼人。但穿白衬衫的男人还是面不改色。他在车门外的漆面上掐灭烟头，扔到地上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The way he flings out his name makes Ove look as if someone just shoved a mallet in his gut. He stares at the man in the white shirt, his mouth slightly agape and his eyes scanning to and fro over the car.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的口气让欧维感觉就像被人在肚子上挥了一锤。他大张着嘴，瞪着穿白衬衫的男人，眼睛扫视着车身。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“那你到底打算怎么阻止我，欧维？”男人最后说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I know a lot about you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我知道的多着呢。”男人说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ove only manages by a whisker to pull his foot out of the way of the wheel as the Škoda moves off again and drives down towards the houses. Ove stands there, in shock, staring after them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他重新发动汽车朝房子开动，车轮离欧维急忙往回收的脚只差一根头发丝的距离。欧维震惊地留在原地，瞪着他的背影。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ove breathes violently through his nose and nails her with his eyes. As if trying to see whether she's lying.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维用鼻孔喘着粗气，眼神牢牢盯在她脸上，像在检查她有没有撒谎。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“那他呢！他怎么知道我叫什么？”欧维一边吼一边朝斯柯达消失的方向挥手，额头上的静脉扭动得就像鼓皮下的蛇。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ove rivets his eyes into her even harder. Finally he nods grimly to himself. Then he turns around and walks towards his house. She calls out to him but he doesn't react. The cat follows him into the hall. Ove closes the door. Farther down the road, the man in the white shirt and the woman with glasses ring the doorbell of Anita and Rune's house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维的目光越发犀利，最后愤懑地点点头，转身朝自己家走去。她在背后喊他，但他毫无反应。猫跟着他走进门厅，欧维关上门。街尽头，穿白衬衫的男人和戴眼镜捧文件的女人按响了安妮塔和鲁尼家的门铃。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I have no idea. I've never seen that man before," she promises.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I… don't know," she says.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我……我不知道。”她说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She takes a step back. Pushes a few evasive wisps of hair out of her face without taking her eyes off Ove's clenched fists.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她倒退了一步，捋了一把额头上垂落的头发，目光不离欧维紧握的拳头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You swiped your card when you paid for your train ticket. I went through the receipts in the register," she says and takes a few more steps back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你买火车票的时候刷了卡，我查了柜台上的售票记录。”她说着又退了一步。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="欧维瘫坐在门厅里的凳子上，因屈辱而颤抖着。">查看中文翻译</div>
