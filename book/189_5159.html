<div class="line_en">That night, and the next, and the next again, the spy sat booted and equipped in his carter's dress: ready to turn out at a word from Fagin. Six nights passed -- six long weary nights -- and on each, Fagin came home with a disappointed face, and briefly intimated that it was not yet time. On the seventh, he returned earlier, and with an exultation he could not conceal. It was Sunday.</div>

<div class="line_en">Scarcely venturing to whisper, but substituting dumb show for words, Fagin, and the young Jew who had admitted them, pointed out the pane of glass to Noah, and signed to him to climb up and observe the person in the adjoining room.</div>

<div class="line_en">Noah started up without saying a word; for the Jew was in a state of such intense excitement that it infected him. They left the house stealthily, and hurrying through a labyrinth of streets, arrived at length before a public-house, which Noah recognised as the same in which he had slept, on the night of his arrival in London.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="诺亚二话不说，拔腿就走，因为老犹太处于极度兴奋的状态，连他也受到感染。两人蹑手蹑脚地离开住所，匆匆穿过一大片错综复杂的街巷，最后来到一家客店门前，诺亚认出来了，这就是自己初到伦敦住过一晚的那家客店。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was past eleven o'clock, and the door was closed. It opened softly on its hinges as Fagin gave a low whistle. They entered, without noise; and the door was closed behind them.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Stay there," whispered Fagin. He signed to Barney, who withdrew. In an instant, the lad entered the room adjoining, and, under pretence of snuffing the candle, moved it in the required position, and, speaking to the girl, caused her to raise her face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“呆着别动。”费金打着耳语，朝巴尼做了个手势，那人退了出去。转眼间，小伙子走进了隔壁房间，以剪烛花为幌子，将蜡烛移到所需要的位置，一边与那姑娘搭讪，有意引她扬起脸来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He did so; and, by the light of the lamps, saw the girl's retreating figure, already at some distance before him. He advanced as near as he considered prudent, and kept on the opposite side of the street, the better to observe her motions. She looked nervously round, twice or thrice, and once stopped to let two men who were following close behind her, pass on. She seemed to gather courage as she advanced, and to walk with a steadier and firmer step. The spy preserved the same relative distance between them, and followed: with his eye upon her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他照着做了，借着路灯认出了姑娘渐渐远去的身影，她已经走了一段距离。诺亚在他认为不失谨慎的限度内尽量靠近对方，一直走在街的对面，这样更便于观察她的举动。姑娘紧张地接连回头看去，还停下来了一次，让两个紧紧跟在她身后的男人走过去。看来她一边走一边在替自己鼓劲，步子变得更沉稳更坚定了。那个包打听一直与她保持着这样的距离，目光盯在她身上，尾随在后。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He hastily descended, as the room-door opened, and the girl came out. Fagin drew him behind a small partition which was curtained off, and they held their breaths as she passed within a few feet of their place of concealment, and emerged by the door at which they had entered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="房门开了，姑娘走了出来，他赶紧退下去。费金拽着他躲到一块挂着帘子的小隔板后边，两个人屏住呼吸，姑娘从离他们的藏身之处只有几步的地方走过去，又从他们进来的那道门出去了。">查看中文翻译</div>
