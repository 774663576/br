<div class="line_en">I nod and go straight to my room. I sit on the bed, knowing I will never write those letters. They will be like the speech I tried to write to honor Rue and Thresh in District 11. Things seemed clear in my head and even when I talked before the crowd, but the words never came out of the pen right. Besides, they were meant to go with embraces and kisses and a stroke of Prim's hair, a caress of Gale's face, a squeeze of Madge's hand. They cannot be delivered with a wooden box containing my cold, stiff body.</div>

A cold soup of pureed vegetables. Fish cakes with creamy lime paste. Those little birds filled with orange sauce, with wild rice and watercress. Chocolate custard dotted with cherries.</div>

<div class="line_en">Too heartsick to cry, all I want is to curl up on the bed and sleep until we arrive in the Capitol tomorrow morning. But I have a mission. No, it's more than a mission. It's my dying wish. Keep Peeta alive. And as unlikely as it seems that I can achieve it in the face of the Capitol's anger, it's important that I be at the top of my game. This won't happen if I'm mourning for everyone I love back home. Let them go, I tell myself. Say good-bye and forget them. I do my best, thinking of them one by one, releasing them like birds from the protective cages inside me, locking the doors against their return.</div>

<div class="line_en">Evidently, Effie doesn't know that my mockingjay pin is now a symbol used by the rebels. At least in District 8. In the Capitol, the mockingjay is still a fun reminder of an especially exciting Hunger Games. What else could it be? Real rebels don't put a secret symbol on something as durable as jewelry. They put it on a wafer of bread that can be eaten in a second if necessary.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="显然，艾菲不知道我的胸针现在已成为反叛者的象征，至少在八区是这样的。在凯匹特，嘲笑鸟仍然是令人兴奋的饥饿游戏的吉祥物。它还能有什么别的意义呢？真正的反叛者是不会把这种秘密符号刻在类似珠宝这样的物品上。他们会把它烤在面包上，在必要时，几秒钟就能把它吞掉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yeah, whatever," says Haymitch. He's not drinking but I can tell he'd like to be. Effie had them take her own wine away when she saw the effort he was making, but he's in a miserable state. If he were the tribute, he would have owed Peeta nothing and could be as drunk as he liked. Now it's going to take all he's got to keep Peeta alive in an arena full of his old friends, and he'll probably fail.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊，什么都行。”黑密斯说。他没有喝酒，可我看得出他很想喝。艾菲看到黑密斯在努力克制自己，就让人把她的酒也拿走了。黑密斯很痛苦。如果他是“贡品”，他就不欠皮塔的情，也就可以尽情欢饮。而现在，他要不遗余力，让皮塔在竞技场一个到处都是他的老朋友的地方一存活下来；而他很可能做不到这一点。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Peeta goes off to retrieve his notebook on the remaining living victors, and we gather in the compartment with the television to see who our competition will be in the arena. We are all in place as the anthem begins to play and the annual recap of the reaping ceremonies in the twelve districts begins.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the history of the Games, there have been seventy-five victors. Fifty-nine are still alive. I recognize many of their faces, either from seeing them as tributes or mentors at previous Games or from our recent viewing of the victors' tapes. Some are so old or wasted by illness, drugs, or drink that I can't place them. As one would expect, the pools of Career tributes from Districts 1, 2, and 4 are the largest. But every district has managed to scrape up at least one female and one male victor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在饥饿游戏的历史上，共产生了七十五个胜利者，仍健在的只有五十九个，他们以前参加比赛或做指导老师时，我在电视上看见过他们，我最近又看过以前的录像，所以大部分人我都能认得。一些胜利者已经年老力衰，另一些疾病缠身，还有的饮酒吸毒，不一而足。可以想见，来自一区、二区、四区的胜利者最多，但每个区都选送了至少男女胜利者各一名。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The reapings go by quickly. Peeta studiously puts stars by the names of the chosen tributes in his notebook. Haymitch watches, his face devoid of emotion, as friends of his step up to take the stage. Effie makes hushed, distressed comments like "Oh, not Cecelia" or "Well, Chaff never could stay out of a fight," and sighs frequently.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从录像中看，抽签仪式进行得很快，皮塔认真地在各区选出的选手名字旁加了星号。黑密斯面无表情，默默地看着，看着他的老朋友一个个地登上舞台。艾菲在一旁低声地做着评论，“噢，不要选茜茜莉亚。”“唔，查夫总是爱打架。”话语忧郁，还不停地叹息。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For my part, I try to make some mental record of the other tributes, but like last year, only a few really stick in my head. There's the classically beautiful brother and sister from District 1 who were victors in consecutive years when I was little. Brutus, a volunteer from District 2, who must be at least forty and apparently can't wait to get back in the arena. Finnick, the handsome bronze-haired guy from District 4 who was crowned ten years ago at the age of fourteen. A hysterical young woman with flowing brown hair is also called from 4, but she's quickly replaced by a volunteer, an eighty-year-old woman who needs a cane to walk to the stage. Then there's Johanna Mason, the only living female victor from 7, who won a few years back by pretending she was a weakling. The woman from 8 who Effie calls Cecelia, who looks about thirty, has to detach herself from the three kids who run up to cling to her. Chaff, a man from 11 who I know to be one of Haymitch's particular friends, is also in.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我尽量把那些选手的信息记在脑子里，但就像去年一样，只有几个人给我留下清晰的印象。一对具有古典美的兄妹来自一区，他们在连续两届饥饿游戏中获胜，那时我还很小。布鲁托，来自二区的志愿选手，他看上去至少四十岁，已经迫不及待地要进入竞技场。芬尼克，来自四区的英俊金发小伙，他十年前在十四岁时赢得了比赛。一个留着棕色长发，来自四区的神经质女人也被抽中，但她很快被一个八十岁的老妇作为自愿者而代替，这位妇人要拄着拐杖才能登台。接着上台的是约翰娜·梅森，她是七区唯一活着的女胜利者，她数年前靠假装成弱者赢得了比赛。来自八区，被艾菲称作茜茜莉亚的女人，看上去三十来岁，在上台前三个孩子拉着她不放，她不得不把他们扯开。查夫，来自十一区，我知道他是黑密斯的特殊朋友，也在选中的人之列。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我的名字被叫到，之后是黑密斯，然后皮塔作为自愿者代替他。一位“贡品”发布人眼睛甚至都湿润了，因为我们这对十二区的“明星恋人”似乎处境不佳。之后，她镇静一下，宣布道：“我敢说这将是有史以来最精彩的比赛！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Because I can't handle the nightmares. Not without you, I think. They are sure to be dreadful tonight. But I can hardly ask Peeta to come sleep with me. We've barely touched since that night Gale was whipped. "What are you going to do?" I ask.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因为我对付不了那可怕的噩梦，没有你我不行。我暗想。我今晚一定会做噩梦，我想要皮塔陪我一起睡，可我张不开口。自从盖尔被打那天起我们就谁也没碰过谁。“你准备干什么？”我问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Just review my notes awhile. Get a clear picture of what we're up against. But I'll go over it with you in the morning. Go to bed, Katniss," he says.</div>

<div class="line_en">So I go to bed and, sure enough, within a few hours I awake from a nightmare where that old woman from District 4 transforms into a large rodent and gnaws on my face. I know I was screaming, but no one comes. Not Peeta, not even one of the Capitol attendants. I pull on a robe to try to calm the gooseflesh crawling over my body. Staying in my compartment is impossible, so I decide to go find someone to make me tea or hot chocolate or anything. Maybe Haymitch is still up. Surely he isn't asleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无奈，我只好上床了。正如我所料，几个小时后我从噩梦中惊醒，那个四区的老妇人变成一只巨大的啮齿动物，她冲着我扑过来。我知道自己肯定尖叫了，但没人过来。皮塔没来，甚至凯匹特侍者也没过来。我披上睡袍，尽力平静下来，好让一身的鸡皮疙瘩落下去。待在自己的包厢已经不可能了，我想喊人来给我弄点茶或热巧克力或别的什么。兴许黑密斯还没睡，嗯，他肯定没睡。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When Peeta holds out his arms, I walk straight into them. It's the first time since they announced the Quarter Quell that he's offered me any sort of affection. He's been more like a very demanding trainer, always pushing, always insisting Haymitch and I run faster, eat more, know our enemy better. Lover? Forget about that. He abandoned any pretense of even being my friend. I wrap my arms tightly around his neck before he can order me to do push-ups or something. Instead he pulls me in close and buries his face in my hair. Warmth radiates from the spot where his lips just touch my neck, slowly spreading through the rest of me. It feels so good, so impossibly good, that I know I will not be the first to let go.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮塔向我伸出双臂，我立刻扑到他的怀里。自从宣布世纪极限赛以来，皮塔还是第一次对我有亲昵的举动。前一段时间，他更像一个严厉的教练，很严厉、很坚持。黑密斯和我跑得越来越快，吃得越来越多，对自己的对手也越来越了解。恋人？算了吧，他甚至懒得假装成我的朋友。趁他还没有命令我要继续加油干，我用双臂紧紧地搂着他的脖子。他把我拉得更近，脸埋在我的头发里。他的嘴唇触到了我的脖颈，一股暖流从他触及的一点散开，传遍了我的全身。那感觉真好，太好了，我知道，我绝不会先放开他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Almost, but not quite," says Haymitch from behind us. I whip around, afraid he's going to be angry over us watching his tape, but he just smirks and takes a swig from a bottle of wine. So much for sobriety. I guess I should be upset he's drinking again, but I'm preoccupied with another feeling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“差不多吧，但也不尽然。”黑密斯站在我们身后说道。我急速转身，真怕他会因为我们看了有关他的录像而生气，可他只是呵呵地笑着，又拿起葡萄酒瓶喝了一大口。别指望他是清醒的啦。看到他又开始喝酒，我本该感到有些不安，可我现在却产生了另外一种想法。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I've spent all these weeks getting to know who my competitors are, without even thinking about who my teammates are. Now a new kind of confidence is lighting up inside of me, because I think I finally know who Haymitch is. And I'm beginning to know who I am. And surely, two people who have caused the Capitol so much trouble can think of a way to get Peeta home alive.</div>
