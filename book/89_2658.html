<div class="line_en">But on the other hand it's quite true. She could have found herself a job. It was just that Kent thought it would be good if she waited awhile. Just a year or so. Who else would take care of everything at home, he asked, and by his way of asking it was clear to her that he wasn't volunteering to do it himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，这么说也不完全是一厢情愿。刚结婚的时候，她的确可以找一份工作，只是肯特觉得再等等更好，只需要再等一年左右。他指出，如果布里特—玛丽出去工作，家里就没人照顾，而且听他的口气，他是肯定不会自告奋勇承担起这个责任的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So after waiting at home with her mother for a few years, Britt-Marie waited at home with Kent's children for a few years, and then Kent's mother became ill and Britt-Marie waited at home with her quite a bit for another few years. Kent felt it was best that way, obviously just during a transitional period until all of Kent's plans had fallen into place, and, of course, it was best for the whole family if Britt-Marie was at home in the afternoons in case the Germans wanted to have dinner. When he said "the whole family" he was obviously referring to everyone in the family except Britt-Marie. "Corporate entertainment is tax-deductible," Kent always explained, but he never explained who would benefit by it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，在家照顾母亲几年之后，布里特—玛丽又在家照顾了肯特的孩子们几年，后来肯特的母亲病了，布里特—玛丽又照顾了她几年。肯特认为这是最好的安排，因为那时候他的事业正处于过渡期，各种计划尚未就位。而且，邀请他的德国客户到家里吃饭时，如果布里特—玛丽能够在家就再好不过了，这样对全家都好。他所谓的“全家”显然是指除了布里特—玛丽之外的家里的每一个人。“以公司的名义进行娱乐消费可以免税。”肯特总是这样说，但他从来不提谁会是免税的受益人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She doesn't say anything about how close she got. She went to job interviews. Several of them. She didn't tell Kent about them, obviously, because he would only have asked what salary she'd get, and if she had told him he would have laughed and said: "Isn't it bloody better, then, if I pay you to stay at home?" He would have meant that as a joke, but she would not have been able to take it in that spirit, and so, as a result, she never said anything. She was always there in good time for the interviews, and there was always someone else waiting there in the visitors' room. Almost exclusively young women. One of them started talking to Britt-Marie, because she couldn't imagine that someone so old was there for the same job as herself. She had three children and had been left by her husband. One of the children had an illness. When she was called in for her interview, Britt-Marie stood up and went home. You could say a lot of things about Britt-Marie, but she was certainly not someone who'd steal a job from someone more in need of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但她没说自己做出过怎样的努力：她去参加过不少工作面试，但并没有告诉肯特，因为他只会问那工作给多少钱。听了她的回答，他会讥笑道：“还不如你留在家里，我发钱给你呢！”他觉得自己不过是开个玩笑，布里特—玛丽却接受不了，所以久而久之，她再也不愿告诉肯特。每次面试她都准时到场，每次总有人比她先到。等候室里清一色几乎都是年轻女性，有一次，其中一位和布里特—玛丽搭话，因为她不相信年龄这么大的人会出来和她找同一份工作。她告诉布里特—玛丽，自己被丈夫抛弃，独自拉扯三个孩子，其中一个孩子还有病。轮到这个女人面试时，布里特—玛丽起身回家去了。你尽可以说布里特—玛丽这里不好那里不对，但她绝对不会和更需要工作的人争夺工作机会。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Kent sighs, then nods mischievously at her, and holds up both hands as if someone is threatening him.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Please Kent, why don't you just move the car. It is actually in the middle of the soccer pitch."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“拜托，肯特，你为什么不把车挪一下？都停到足球场中间去了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sven blushes and fixes his gaze on the zipper of his jacket. Britt-Marie's breathing speeds up and she steps forward as if she's about to move between them physically. In the end she just puts her feet down hard in the gravel and says:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯文的脸红了，眼睛盯着自己的夹克拉链。布里特—玛丽的呼吸急促起来，她向前走了几步，似乎打算站在他俩中间，但最后只是重重地跺了两下脚，说：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Sure, sure, sure, if the sheriff insists. No problem. Just don't shoot!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然，当然可以，如果警长坚持这样要求的话。没问题，您只要别开枪就好！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He takes a few demonstrative steps forward and leans over Britt-Marie. She can't remember the last time he kissed her on the cheek.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他夸张地走了几步，向布里特—玛丽靠过去。她已经不记得他上次亲她的脸是什么时候了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I checked into the hotel in town. Bloody rathole, you know how it is in places like this, but I noticed there was a restaurant opposite. It looked okay, under the circumstances," he says so Sven will hear. When he says "circumstances" he makes a superior sort of gesture at the pizzeria and the recreation center and the road. He revs the engine more than he needs to when he moves the car. When he's done, he gives his business card to Omar, because Kent likes giving people his business card almost as much as he likes telling people what his belongings cost. The boy is deeply impressed. Britt-Marie realizes that she doesn't know at what exact point Sven turned around and left, only that he's gone now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我去镇上的旅馆看了看，那儿的房间简直像该死的老鼠洞一样，你知道吧，这种地方都这样。不过我发现旅馆对面有家餐馆还算不错，就这种环——境——而言。”他故意提高声音让斯文听见，说到“环境”两个字时，他以充满优越感的姿态，依次指点着披萨店、娱乐中心和那条公路。挪车时，他故意狂轰油门，引擎发出炫耀的鸣响。挪好车，他又给奥马尔一张自己的名片，因为除了告诉别人他买来的东西有多贵，肯特还喜欢分发名片。他的这几招让奥马尔深受触动。布里特—玛丽不记得斯文是什么时候转身离开的，等她意识到的时候，他已经走了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She stands alone outside the pizzeria. If something within her has been knocked down and shattered, she tries to tell herself, it is all her own fault, because these feelings she has inside should never have been set free in the first place. It is far too late to start a new life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她独自站在披萨店外面，心里仿佛有什么东西被敲得粉碎。她试着告诉自己，这一切都是她的错，因为她从来不曾把自己的内心感觉放在第一位，开始新的生活已然太晚。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She has dinner with Kent at the restaurant in town. It has white tablecloths and a menu without photographs and seems to have a serious attitude about the cutlery. Or at least it does not treat it like a joke. Kent says he feels alone without her. "Lost" is the word he uses. He seems to be taking her seriously, or at least he isn't treating her as a joke. He's wearing his old, broken belt, she notices, and she realizes this is because he did not find his usual one that she mended just before she left. She wants to tell him it's lying neatly rolled up in the second drawer of the wardrobe in the bedroom. Their bedroom. She wants him to shout out her name.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她和肯特在镇上的那家餐馆吃了晚饭，那儿有白色的桌布和一本没有照片的菜单，对待餐具的态度似乎也很严肃，或者至少可以说，这家餐馆没把餐具的选择看成是一个笑话。肯特告诉布里特—玛丽，她不在，他觉得很孤独。其实他的原话是“不知道该怎么办”，总之看起来他对待她的态度也挺严肃，至少没把她当成笑话。她注意到，他把以前的旧皮带找出来系上了，看起来破破烂烂，而她走之前刚刚修理过他经常系的那根皮带，他显然是没找到。她想告诉他，它就在卧室衣柜的第二个抽屉里，已经整整齐齐地卷好了。在他们的卧室。她希望他大声喊出她的名字。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你必须相信我，我真的知道错了，亲爱的。已经结束了。我不会再联系她。你不能因为我走错这一步就惩罚我一辈子，对不对？”他越过桌子伸过手来，轻轻握住她缠着绷带的那只手。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">While he's reaching across the table for her fries, Britt-Marie peers out of the window and for a moment she has a feeling that there was a police car in the street. But this could merely have been a figment of her imagination. Ashamed of herself, she looks down at her napkin. Here she is, a grown woman, with fantasies of emergency vehicles. What would people think?</div>

<div class="line_en">Kent drives her to soccer practice and waits in his BMW until it's over. Bank is also there, so Britt-Marie lets her take care of the training while Britt-Marie mainly just stands there holding on to the list.
