<div class="line_en">When the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a towhead in a big bend on the Illinois side, and hacked off cottonwood branches with the hatchet, and covered up the raft with them so she looked like there had been a cave-in in the bank there. A towhead is a sandbar that has cottonwoods on it as thick as harrow-teeth.</div>

<div class="line_en">It must a been close on to one o'clock when we got below the island at last, and the raft did seem to go mighty slow. If a boat was to come along we was going to take to the canoe and break for the Illinois shore; and it was well a boat didn't come, for we hadn't ever thought to put the gun in the canoe, or a fishing-line, or anything to eat. We was in ruther too much of a sweat to think of so many things. It warn't good judgment to put everything on the raft.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后到达岛子下边的时候，准定快深夜一点钟了。看来木筏子是走得挺慢的。要是有船开过来，我们准备坐上独木小舟，冲向伊利诺斯州的河岸去。幸好没有船来。我们没有想到要把枪藏在独木小舟里，也没有想到把钓鱼竿放在小舟上钓东西吃。我们急忙慌乱之余，实在想不到这么多。当初把什么都放到木筏上，这实在并非是个好主意。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">If the men went to the island I just expect they found the camp fire I built, and watched it all night for Jim to come. Anyways, they stayed away from us, and if my building the fire never fooled them it warn't no fault of mine. I played it as low down on them as I could.</div>

<div class="line_en">When it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of the cottonwood thicket, and looked up and down and across; nothing in sight; so Jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snug wigwam to get under in blazing weather and rainy, and to keep the things dry. Jim made a floor for the wigwam, and raised it a foot or more above the level of the raft, so now the blankets and all the traps was out of reach of steamboat waves. Right in the middle of the wigwam we made a layer of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it for to hold it to its place; this was to build a fire on in sloppy weather or chilly; the wigwam would keep it from being seen. We made an extra steering-oar, too, because one of the others might get broke on a snag or something. We fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lantern on, because we must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat coming down-stream, to keep from getting run over; but we wouldn't have to light it for up-stream boats unless we see we was in what they call a "crossing"; for the river was pretty high yet, very low banks being still a little under water; so up-bound boats didn't always run the channel, but hunted easy water.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="天快黑下来了，我们在白杨枝桠里探出脑袋，朝四下里上下左右张望了一番，什么也没有见到。杰姆便拿起了木筏子上层的几块木板，搭起了一个挺舒适的小窝棚，好在太阳辣辣的时候或者下雨的时候，能有个保持东西干燥的去处。杰姆还在窝棚底下安了个地板，比木筏子高出一英尺多，这样，毯子啦和全部什物，都不会被开过来的轮船激起的水浪冲潮湿。在窝棚的正中央，我们铺了五六英寸的土，安了个框架子，四周围得严严实实，好在刮风下雨的天气生起火来，火光能由窝棚给遮住，从外边望不见。我们还做了一把备用的掌舵的桨，以备万一碰上暗礁什么的把原有的桨碰坏了。我们竖起一根矮树杈子，把那盏旧的灯挂了上去，因为每当有轮船往下游开来，我们必须点亮这盏灯，防止它把我们撞翻。不过，有上水的轮船开来，我们不用点灯，除非我们发现自己漂到了人家所说的“横水道”①上，因为河水还涨得很高，很低的河岸还有一小部分淹没在水下，因此上水的船往往不闯这个水道，而寻找流得慢一些的水道走。“横水道”指轮船在密西西比河上为了选择在平稳的水流中航行，有时从河中一边横向另一边。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We had mountains on the Missouri shore and heavy timber on the Illinois side, and the channel was down the Missouri shore at that place, so we warn't afraid of anybody running across us. We laid there all day, and watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the Missouri shore, and up-bound steamboats fight the big river in the middle. I told Jim all about the time I had jabbering with that woman; and Jim said she was a smart one, and if she was to start after us herself she wouldn't set down and watch a camp fire – no, sir, she'd fetch a dog. Well, then, I said, why couldn't she tell her husband to fetch a dog? Jim said he bet she did think of it by the time the men was ready to start, and he believed they must a gone up-town to get a dog and so they lost all that time, or else we wouldn't be here on a towhead sixteen or seventeen mile below the village – no, indeedy, we would be in that same old town again. So I said I didn't care what was the reason they didn't get us as long as they didn't.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="密苏里沿岸山岭起伏，伊利诺斯一边是密密的白杨树，航道在这里沿着密苏里一边，因此我们并不担心会遇到什么人。我们一整天躺在那里，看着一些木筏子和轮船沿着密苏里河岸向下游驶去，看着朝上游驶去的轮船在大河的河水中央使劲搏斗。我把我跟那个妇女瞎聊的话一五一十全讲给杰姆听，杰姆说，这个妇女可是个精明的人，还说，要是由她来搜捕我们的话，她准不会停下来坐等在火堆旁边——不，她会找好一只狗来。我说，那么她为什么不是叫她的丈夫找好一只狗呢？杰姆说，依他看，那几个男人准备动身的时候，她准定会想到找条狗。他相信，这些人准定是到镇上去找一条狗，这样，他们就把时间全耽误了，不然的话，我们此刻就不会来到下游离村子十六七英里的沙洲上了，——不，肯定不会。我们只会又回到我们老家那个镇上了。我就说，不管是什么个原因吧，反正他们没有能逮住我们。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Every night we passed towns, some of them away up on black hillsides, nothing but just a shiny bed of lights; not a house could you see. The fifth night we passed St. Louis, and it was like the whole world lit up. In St. Petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty thousand people in St. Louis, but I never believed it till I see that wonderful spread of lights at two o'clock that still night. There warn't a sound there; everybody was asleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每个晚上，我们都要漂过一些镇子，其中有一些是在上边黑糊糊的山脚底下，除了一些灯火之外，见不到一间房屋。第五个晚上，我们路过圣路易，顿时仿佛满世界都点上了灯。在圣彼得堡那边，人们总说圣路易有两三万人之多，我一直不信这话，只是到那个晚上，在两点钟的时候，亲眼见到了那奇妙的灯海，这才信了。在那里，没有一丝儿声音，家家户户都熟睡了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This second night we run between seven and eight hours, with a current that was making over four mile an hour. We catched fish and talked, and we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness. It was kind of solemn, drifting down the big, still river, laying on our backs looking up at the stars, and we didn't ever feel like talking loud, and it warn't often that we laughed – only a little kind of a low chuckle. We had mighty good weather as a general thing, and nothing ever happened to us at all – that night, nor the next, nor the next.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二个晚上，我们乘了大约七八个钟头，水流每小时四英里。我们捉鱼，聊天，或者为了打破瞌睡，下水游它一会儿。顺着这静静的大河往下漂，仰卧在筏子上望着星星，倒是一件带着庄严意味的事。我们这时候无心大声说话，大笑的时候也挺少，只不过偶尔低低地格格两声就是了。我们遇到的天气，一般总是好天气。那天夜里一切太平，第二天，第三天，都是如此。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Every night now I used to slip ashore towards ten o'clock at some little village, and buy ten or fifteen cents' worth of meal or bacon or other stuff to eat; and sometimes I lifted a chicken that warn't roosting comfortable, and took him along. Pap always said, take a chicken when you get a chance, because if you don't want him yourself you can easy find somebody that does, and a good deed ain't ever forgot. I never see pap when he didn't want the chicken himself, but that is what he used to say, anyway.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mornings before daylight I slipped into cornfields and borrowed a watermelon, or a mushmelon, or a punkin, or some new corn, or things of that kind. Pap always said it warn't no harm to borrow things if you was meaning to pay them back some time; but the widow said it warn't anything but a soft name for stealing, and no decent body would do it. Jim said he reckoned the widow was partly right and pap was partly right; so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three things from the list and say we wouldn't borrow them any more – then he reckoned it wouldn't be no harm to borrow the others. So we talked it over all one night, drifting along down the river, trying to make up our minds whether to drop the watermelons, or the cantelopes, or the mushmelons, or what. But towards daylight we got it all settled satisfactory, and concluded to drop crabapples and p'simmons. We warn't feeling just right before that, but it was all comfortable now. I was glad the way it come out, too, because crabapples ain't ever good, and the p'simmons wouldn't be ripe for two or three months yet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一清早，天大亮前，我便溜进玉米田，借一只西瓜或是甜瓜，或是南瓜，或者几个刚熟的玉米，诸如此类。爸爸老说，借借东西，只要你存心在有的时候偿还人家，那没有什么害处。不过，那位寡妇说，那不过是偷东西的好听一些的说法罢了，正派人没有一个肯干这样的事。杰姆说，依他看，寡妇说的有一部分道理，你爸爸说的也有一部分道理，最理想的办法是我们搞好一份清单，从中挑出两三种东西，先借到手，然后说明，往后不再借了——依他看，这样一来以后再借别的东西就不碍事了。我们就这样商量了一整夜，一边在大河上朝下游漂过去，一边准备定下主意，看能否不用借西瓜，或者香瓜，或者甜瓜了吧。商量到天大亮，问题全都得到了圆满解决，决定不借山里红和柿子，把这两项从单子上删掉。在这样决定以前，大家心里总有点儿不大痛快，决定以后，大家都觉得心里好受了。能这样作出决定，我也很高兴，因为山里红根本不好吃，柿子呢，还要两三个月才熟透。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The fifth night below St. Louis we had a big storm after midnight, with a power of thunder and lightning, and the rain poured down in a solid sheet. We stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself. When the lightning glared out we could see a big straight river ahead, and high, rocky bluffs on both sides. By and by says I, "Hel-LO, Jim, looky yonder!" It was a steamboat that had killed herself on a rock. We was drifting straight down for her. The lightning showed her very distinct. She was leaning over, with part of her upper deck above water, and you could see every little chimbly-guy clean and clear, and a chair by the big bell, with an old slouch hat hanging on the back of it, when the flashes come.</div>

Jim couldn't say nothing to that, so he didn't try. "And besides," I says, "we might borrow something worth having out of the captain's stateroom. Seegars, I bet you – and cost five cents apiece, solid cash. Steamboat captains is always rich, and get sixty dollars a month, and THEY don't care a cent what a thing costs, you know, long as they want it. Stick a candle in your pocket; I can't rest, Jim, till we give her a rummaging. Do you reckon Tom Sawyer would ever go by this thing? Not for pie, he wouldn't. He'd call it an adventure – that's what he'd call it; and he'd land on that wreck if it was his last act. And wouldn't he throw style into it? – wouldn't he spread himself, nor nothing? Why, you'd think it was Christopher C'lumbus discovering Kingdom-Come. I wish Tom Sawyer WAS here."</div>

<div class="line_en">Packard didn't take no notice of that, but hung up his lantern on a nail and started towards where I was there in the dark, and motioned Bill to come. I crawfished as fast as I could about two yards, but the boat slanted so that I couldn't make very good time; so to keep from getting run over and catched I crawled into a stateroom on the upper side. The man came apawing along in the dark, and when Packard got to my stateroom, he says:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="巴卡特没有理会这些话，只是把灯挂在一只钉子上。在一片漆黑中，他往我藏身的地方走过来，一边招呼比尔也过来。我赶紧拼命往后爬，往后缩了两码。可是轮船船身倾斜得太厉害，我一时间爬不多远。为了不致被他们踩在身上，给逮住，我爬进了上舱一间官舱里，巴卡特在黑暗里用手摸着走，摸到了我在的那间官舱。他说：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And in he come, and Bill after him. But before they got in I was up in the upper berth, cornered, and sorry I come. Then they stood there, with their hands on the ledge of the berth, and talked. I couldn't see them, but I could tell where they was by the whisky they'd been having. I was glad I didn't drink whisky; but it wouldn't made much difference anyway, because most of the time they couldn't a treed me because I didn't breathe. I was too scared. And, besides, a body COULDN'T breathe and hear such talk. They talked low and earnest. Bill wanted to kill Turner. He says:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他进来了，比尔也随着进来了。不过啊，在他们进来以前，我爬到了上铺，已无退身的余地。这时我真后悔，我真不该爬上了这条船啊。接着，他们站在那里，手扶住了上铺的边上，说起了话来。我看不到他们，不过凭了他们一直在喝的威士忌的气味，能知道他们在哪里。我幸亏没有喝威士忌，这是该高兴的事。不过话说回来，喝不喝也无所谓，因为我多半时间里，连气也不敢喘，他们不会逮住我。再说，一个人要这样听人家说话，自己就不能喘气的。他们说话的时候，说得声音很低，可说得十分认真。比尔想要把透纳给杀了。他说：">查看中文翻译</div>
