<div class="line_en">Afterwards, I was never entirely sure why Will changed his mind about Alicia and Rupert's nuptials. I suspected there was probably a large dose of natural contrariness in his decision -- nobody expected him to go, probably least of all Alicia and Rupert themselves. Perhaps it was about finally getting closure. But I think in the last couple of months she had lost the power to wound him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我一直没搞懂为什么威尔改变了主意，要参加艾丽西娅和鲁珀特的婚礼。我怀疑他的决定中有很大成分是自然的逆反心理——没人希望他去，尤其是艾丽西娅和鲁珀特。也或许是他想要来一个彻底的结束，但我觉得在最近几个月中，她已经没有伤害他的能力了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We went online and picked out a wedding present. Will spent £120 on a silver picture frame, and a vase that he said was "absolutely vile" for another £60. I was shocked that he would spend that much money on someone he didn't even really like, but I had worked out within weeks of being employed by the Traynors that they had different ideas about money. They wrote four-figure cheques without giving it a thought. I had seen Will's bank statement once, when it had been left on the kitchen table for him to look at. It contained enough money to buy our house twice over -- and that was only his current account.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们在网上选了结婚礼物。威尔花120英镑买了一个银相框，又花60英镑买了一个他觉得“非常糟糕”的花瓶。对于一个他并不真正喜欢的人，他花这么多钱，让我很震惊。不过在特雷纳家工作了这么长时间，我已经知道他们对钱有着不同的观念。他们想也不想就会开出四位数的支票，有一次威尔的银行对账单放在厨房餐桌上以便他查看时，我见过。里面包含足够买两个我们家房子的钱——那还只是他的活期存款账户。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I decided to wear my red dress -- partly because I knew Will liked it (and I figured today he was going to need all the minor boosts he could get) -- but also because I didn't actually have any other dresses which I felt brave enough to wear at such a gathering. Will had no idea of the fear I felt at the thought of going to a society wedding, let alone as "the help". Every time I thought of the braying voices, the assessing glances in our direction, I wanted to spend the day watching Patrick run in circles instead. Perhaps it was shallow of me to even care, but I couldn't help it. The thought of those guests looking down on both of us was already tying my stomach in knots.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我决定穿我的红裙子——部分原因是我知道威尔喜欢这件裙子（我估计今天他会需要所有能得到的微小激励）——另外也因为我没有能在这种聚会上穿的其他裙子。想到要参加一个上层社会的婚礼，我很恐惧，威尔对此一点概念也没有，更不用说“帮忙”。每次我想到刺耳的尖叫，看向我们的评判的目光，我都想那天还是看帕特里克跑步好了。也许在乎这个是因为我太肤浅，但是我没办法不这样。想起那些客人看向我们的目光就已经让我的胃打结了。">查看中文翻译</div>

Going to the wedding of an ex seemed a masochistic act at the best of times, but to go to a public gathering, one that would be full of his old friends and work colleagues, to watch her marry his former friend, seemed to me a sure-fire route to depression. I tried to suggest as much the day before we left, but he brushed it off.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我什么都没有对威尔说，我替他感到害怕。参加前女友的婚礼在情况最好的时候似乎都是自我虐待，而参加一个公众的聚会，一个满是他的老朋友和旧同事出席的聚会，看她嫁给自己以前的朋友，肯定会引发抑郁。我们出发的前一天，我一直暗示着这些，但是他毫不理会。">查看中文翻译</div>

It was a two-hour drive, and I had built in rest stops, planning our route carefully to ensure we had the best facilities available. I got ready in the bathroom, pulling stockings over my newly shaved legs, painting on make-up and then rubbing it off again in case the posh guests thought I looked like a call girl.

<div class="line_en">"Not bad, eh?" Nathan stepped back, and there was Will, in a dark suit and a cornflower-blue shirt with a tie. He was clean-shaven, and carried a faint tan on his face. The shirt made his eyes look peculiarly vivid. They seemed, suddenly, to carry a glint of the sun.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不错嘛。”内森往后退了一步，威尔在那里，身着深色西服和矢车菊蓝的衬衣，系着领结。脸上刮得干干净净，有一点点黑。这件衬衣衬托得他的眼睛尤其有神采，它们看起来仿佛突然闪耀着太阳般的光芒。">查看中文翻译</div>

A large, Georgian rectory, its tall windows partly obscured by showers of pale wisteria, its drive a caramel pea shingle, it was the perfect house for a colonel.

<div class="line_en">I parked, climbed out, adjusted my wrap around myself, and clicked the controls that would lower the ramp. "Okay," I said, as Will's wheels met the ground. Across the road from us in the field, people were climbing out of huge, Germanic cars, women in fuchsia dresses muttering to their husbands as their heels sank into the grass.

Alicia looked as ridiculously beautiful as I had known she would, her skin polished a pale caramel, the bias-cut off-white silk skimming her slim figure as if it wouldn't dare rest there without permission.

I wondered if a team of professionals had done her hair and make-up. I wondered if she was wearing control pants. Of course not.

Rupert sweated into his penguin suit and raised an eyebrow as if he felt pleased and a bit daft at the same time. Nobody clapped or cheered as they were pronounced man and wife.

<div class="line_en">I was less fortunate with the man on my left. He took about four minutes -- the briefest of quizzes about who I was, where I lived, who I knew there -- to work out that there was nothing I had to say that might be of interest to him. He turned back to the woman on his left, leaving me to plough silently through what remained of my lunch. At one point, when I started to feel properly awkward, I felt Will's arm slide off the chair beside me, and his hand landed on my arm. I glanced up and he winked at me. I took his hand and squeezed it, grateful that he could see it. And then he moved his chair back six inches, and brought me into the conversation with Mary Rawlinson.</div>

<div class="line_en">I barely heard what they said. It seemed to me to be one puffed-up penguin-suited man after another, referring to people and places I didn't know, provoking polite laughter. I sat and chewed my way through the dark-chocolate truffles that had arrived in silver baskets on the table, and drank three cups of coffee in quick succession so that as well as feeling drunk I felt jittery and wired. Will, on the other hand, was a picture of stillness. He sat and watched the guests applaud his ex-girlfriend, and listened to Rupert drone on about what a perfectly wonderful woman she was. Nobody acknowledged him. I don't know if that was because they wanted to spare his feelings, or because his presence there was actually a bit of an embarrassment. Occasionally Mary Rawlinson leant in and muttered something into his ear and he nodded slightly, as if in agreement.</div>

<div class="line_en">Something happened that evening. The lights dropped, so that our little table was less conspicuous, the overpowering fragrance of the flowers was tempered by the evening breezes, and the music and the wine and the dancing meant that in the most unlikely of places, we all began to actually enjoy ourselves. Will was the most relaxed I had seen him. Sandwiched between me and Mary, he talked and smiled at her, and there was something about the sight of him being briefly happy that repelled those people who might otherwise have looked at him askance, or offered pitying glances. He made me lose my wrap and sit up straight. I took off his jacket and loosened his tie, and we both tried not to giggle at the sight of the dancing. I cannot tell you how much better I felt once I saw the way posh people danced. The men looked as if they had been electrocuted, the women did little pointy fingers at the stars and looked horribly self-conscious even as they twirled.</div>

<div class="line_en">I closed my eyes and wrapped my arms around his neck, letting my cheek rest against his, breathing in the citrus smell of his aftershave. I could feel him humming along with the music.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我闭上双眼，抱住他的脖子，脸贴住他的面颊，呼吸着他须后水的柑橘香味。我可以感觉到他轻声哼唱着音乐。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A couple of people were smiling encouragingly, but most seemed not to know what to make of it. Mary saluted me with her drink. And then I saw Alicia staring at us, her face briefly falling. When she saw me looking, she turned away and muttered something to Rupert. He shook his head, as if we were doing something disgraceful.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有几个人微笑着表示鼓励，但大多数人似乎还搞不清楚是怎么回事。玛丽举起酒杯向我祝贺。我看见艾丽西娅盯着我们，她的脸色都变了。她发现我在看她时，转过脸对鲁珀特说着话。他摇了摇头，似乎我们在做什么丢脸的事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Will changed direction. My arms looped around his neck, I pulled back a little to look at him, no longer self-conscious. He glanced down at my chest. To be fair, with me positioned where I was, there wasn't anywhere else he could really look. He lifted his gaze from my cleavage and raised an eyebrow. "You know, you would never have let those breasts so close to me if I weren't in a wheelchair," he murmured.</div>
