<div class="line_en">I had been a magistrate for almost eleven years now. I watched the whole of human life come through my court: the hopeless waifs who couldn't get themselves together sufficiently even to make a court appointment on time; the repeat offenders; the angry, hard-faced young men and exhausted, debt-ridden mothers. It's quite hard to stay calm and understanding when you see the same faces, the same mistakes made again and again. I could sometimes hear the impatience in my tone. It could be oddly dispiriting, the blank refusal of humankind to even attempt to function responsibly.</div>

<div class="line_en">I got through the tougher days because of my garden. As the children grew it had become a bit of an obsession of mine. I could give you the Latin name of almost any plant you cared to point at. The funny thing was, I didn't even do Latin at school -- mine was a rather minor public school for girls where the focus was on cooking and embroidery, things that would help us become good wives -- but the thing about those plant names is that they do stick in your head. I only ever needed to hear one once to remember it forever: Helleborus niger, Eremurus stenophyllus, Athyrium niponicum. I can repeat those with a fluency I never had at school.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="多亏了花园，我才熬过了那些艰难的日子。随着孩子们渐渐长大，我越来越迷恋花园。我知道你指出来的几乎每样植物的拉丁语名称。搞笑的是，我在学校时根本没有学过拉丁文——我上的是一所相当小的公立女子学校，主要学习烹饪和刺绣，有助于我们成为好妻子的课程——但是有关这些植物的名字却深深地根植在我的心中。我只要听过一次，就永远不会忘记，如黑嚏根草、剑叶独尾草、华东蹄盖蕨。我能非常流利地重复这些名字，这是我在课堂上做不到的事情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And our little town, despite the beauty of the castle, our many Grade II listed buildings, our picturesque country lanes, was far from immune to it. Our Regency squares held cider-drinking teenagers, our thatched cottages muffled the sounds of husbands beating their wives and children. Sometimes I felt like King Canute, making vain pronouncements in the face of a tide of chaos and creeping devastation. But I loved my job. I did it because I believe in order, in a moral code. I believe that there is a right and a wrong, unfashionable as that view might be.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们这个小镇，尽管有美丽的城堡、为数众多的历史建筑、风景如画的乡间小道，但还是没能远离尘嚣。年轻人在摄政广场喝苹果酒，茅草屋隔绝了丈夫殴打妻子和孩子的声音。有时我觉得这里就像克努特国王，面对着风起云涌的浪潮和渐渐侵蚀的破坏，做着无益的声明。但我爱我的工作，我做这份工作就是因为我相信法律，相信道德秩序。我相信善恶有别，这个观点兴许过时了吧。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They say you only really appreciate a garden once you reach a certain age, and I suppose there is a truth in that. It's probably something to do with the great circle of life. There seems to be something miraculous about seeing the relentless optimism of new growth after the bleakness of winter, a kind of joy in the difference every year, the way nature chooses to show off different parts of the garden to its full advantage. There have been times -- the times when my marriage proved to be somewhat more populated than I had anticipated -- when it has been a refuge, times when it has been a joy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="人们说只有你到一定年纪时，才能真正欣赏一座花园，我觉得这话还是有道理的。这大概与生生不息的生命有莫大关联。萧瑟的冬天过后，万物复苏，这不屈不挠的向上精神让人觉得不可思议。每一年的景象都变化万千，每一年大自然都会充分展现花园不同部分的胜景，让人油然而生一种愉悦。有些时候——我的婚姻生活比我期待的似乎稍不尽如人意——花园就成了我的庇护所，在这里我很开心。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There have even been times when it was, frankly, a pain. There is nothing more disappointing than creating a new border only to see it fail to flourish, or to watch a row of beautiful alliums destroyed overnight by some slimy culprit. But even when I complained about the time, the effort involved in caring for it, the way my joints protested at an afternoon spent weeding, or my fingernails never looked quite clean, I loved it. I loved the sensual pleasures of being outside, the smell of it, the feel of the earth under my fingers, the satisfaction of seeing things living, glowing, captivated by their own temporary beauty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="坦白地说，花园有时也让我忧伤。亲手开辟出的一垄花田没能茂盛生长，一排漂亮的葱花因为下雨带来的泥泞一夜之间面目全非，没有什么比看到这些更令人心灰意冷。但即便我有过抱怨，为料理花园付出了不少心血，下午锄完草后关节感到不适，手指甲看起来总是不太干净，我还是热爱这个花园。我喜欢身处室外那种全身心的愉悦、空气中的气味、指尖泥土的触感和看到万物生机盎然的那种欢悦，我沉迷于它们短暂的美丽。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was only when we brought Will back home, once the annexe was adapted and ready, that I could see a point in making it beautiful again. I needed to give my son something to look at. I needed to tell him, silently, that things might change, grow or fail, but that life did go on. That we were all part of some great cycle, some pattern that it was only God's purpose to understand. I couldn't say that to him, of course -- Will and I have never been able to say much to each other -- but I wanted to show him. A silent promise, if you like, that there was a bigger picture, a brighter future.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等到我把威尔带回家，配楼也改装完毕时，我才找到让花园重新漂亮起来的意义。我要给我儿子一些可以欣赏的东西，我要悄悄告诉他，四季更迭，万物枯荣，但是生活在继续。我们都是一个伟大循环中的一部分，只有上帝才了解其间的原理。我不能亲口对他说这些——诚然，威尔和我从未对彼此说过太多——但是我想展示给他看。这是一个无声的承诺，如果你愿意这么理解的话，那就有更为壮观的美景，更为美好的未来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was that I could suddenly see no point. I paid a gardener to come and keep the garden tidy, and I don't think I gave it anything but the most cursory of looks for the best part of a year.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我突然觉得园艺没有了意义。我请了一位园丁来打理花园，我觉得我没有付出任何心思，在一年中最好的时节里，我只是保持了它最为原始的样子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After Will's accident I didn't garden for a year. It wasn't just the time, although the endless hours spent at hospital, the time spent toing and froing in the car, the meetings -- oh God, the meetings -- took up so much of it. I took six months' compassionate leave from work and there was still not enough of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="威尔出事之后，一年里我都没有从事园艺活动。不仅仅是时间问题，无数时间花在医院里，坐车来来回回，无休止的开会——噢，天哪，那些会议——占据了那么多时间。我请了六个月的事假，还不够。">查看中文翻译</div>

He manoeuvred the remaining half-burnt logs expertly with a poker, sending glowing sparks up the chimney, then dropped a new log on to the middle.

It's an unfair advantage, being able to walk away from a man in a wheelchair. There are two steps between the annexe and the main house, and without Nathan's help he could not traverse them.

He repeated his request every time I went in to see him until I almost had to persuade myself to go in each day. I don't want to live like this, Mother. This is not the life I chose. There is no prospect of my recovery, hence it is a perfectly reasonable request to ask to end it in a manner I see fit. I heard him and could well imagine what he had been like in those business meetings, the career that had made him rich and arrogant. He was a man who was used to being heard, after all.

<div class="line_en">And then on 22 January, a day when I was stuck in court with a relentless roll call of shoplifters and uninsured drivers, of weeping angry ex-partners, Steven walked into the annexe and found our son almost unconscious, his head lolling by his armrest, a sea of dark, sticky blood pooling around his wheels. He had located a rusty nail, barely half an inch emerging from some hurriedly finished woodwork in the back lobby, and, pressing his wrist against it, had reversed backwards and forwards until his flesh was sliced to ribbons. I cannot to this day imagine the determination that kept him going, even though he must have been half delirious from the pain. The doctors said he was less than twenty minutes from death.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="1月22日那天，我在法院忙得无法脱身，要完成对商店窃贼、未投保驾驶员以及他们伤心垂泪而愤怒的旧搭档的无情检录。斯蒂文走进配楼，发现我们的儿子几乎失去知觉，头垂在扶手边，轮椅上有一摊黑而黏的血。他找到了一根生锈的铁钉，从大厅后面仓促完成的木制品上突出来的铁钉，几乎有半英寸长。他把手腕压在上面，来回翻转，直到他的肉被撕裂成碎片。直到今天，我都无法想象让他这么进行下去的决心，尽管疼痛肯定会让他半昏迷。医生说再有二十分钟他就死了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He didn't understand, you see. He hadn't worked it out yet. That Will would try again. That our lives would have to be spent in a state of constant vigilance, waiting for the next time, waiting to see what horror he would inflict upon himself. We would have to see the world through his eyes -- the potential poisons, the sharp objects, the inventiveness with which he could finish the job that damned motorcyclist had started. Our lives had to shrink to fit around the potential for that one act. And he had the advantage -- he had nothing else to think about, you see?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="要知道，他并不理解。他至今仍不明白，威尔会再一次自杀的。我们会永远战战兢兢地活着，等待下一次，看他会怎样折磨自己。我们不得不通过他的眼睛去看这个世界——潜在的毒药，锋利的物体，他为结束那个该死的摩托车手引发的一切而想出来的点子。考虑到他可能再次行动，我们不得不退缩。他占了上风——他没什么可想，你瞧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When they told me at the hospital that Will would live, I walked outside into my garden and I raged. I raged at God, at nature, at whatever fate had brought our family to such depths. Now I look back and I must have seemed quite mad. I stood in my garden that cold evening and I hurled my large brandy twenty feet into the Euonymus compactus and I screamed, so that my voice broke the air, bouncing off the castle walls and echoing into the distance. I was so furious, you see, that all around me were things that could move and bend and grow and reproduce, and my son -- my vital, charismatic, beautiful boy -- was just this thing. Immobile, wilted, bloodied, suffering. Their beauty seemed like an obscenity. I screamed and I screamed and I swore -- words I didn't know I knew -- until Steven came out and stood, his hand resting on my shoulder, waiting until he could be sure that I would be silent again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在医院里他们告诉我威尔被救活后，我来到我的花园，愤怒不已。我咒骂上帝，咒骂自然，咒骂给我们家带来如此灾难的命运！现在回想起来，我当时肯定是疯了。那个寒冷的傍晚，我站在花园里，把大瓶的白兰地扔出了二十英尺，砸碎了街边酒吧的窗户。我大喊大叫，声音穿透了空气，从城堡的墙壁反射回来，在远方回响。我怒不可遏，你瞧，周围的一切都可以动，可以弯，可以生长，可以繁殖，我的儿子——我的心肝，我魅力超凡、英俊潇洒的孩子却不能动，萎靡不振，浑身是血，受尽苦难！大自然的美丽让人可憎。我叫着、喊着、咒骂着我不知道我会的话语——直到斯蒂文出现，他的手放在我的肩头，在一旁等待，直到他确定我又恢复沉默。">查看中文翻译</div>
