<div class="line_en">Will wrote his play Richard Ⅲ for Richard Burbage, and it was a great success. Richard the Third was a wicked king -- a murderer -- but he was wonderful on the stage, with Burbage's great voice and fine acting. Soon all London was saying King Richard's famous words when his horse is killed in war:</div>

<div class="line_en">All kinds of people came to see plays and Will was making a lot of new friends. One day, after the play, he was talking to a young man outside the Rose. He was a very beautiful young man, a bit like a girl, perhaps -- but still very good-looking. Later, I asked Will who he was.</div>

<div class="line_en">The plague is terrible in any place, but it was worst in London. In those narrow streets, with houses so close together, and the dirty water running down the middle of the street, there was no escape. When the plague came, it ran like fire through the town. If someone in a house got the plague, then the doors were shut and locked, and a big red cross was put on the door. Nobody could leave the house. You had to stay inside and fight -- or die. If you were rich, you left London as fast as you could.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其实，各地瘟疫都很严重，只不过伦敦尤其厉害。狭窄的街道、拥挤的房屋，街道中心污水横流，人们又怎能幸免。瘟疫一来，势不可挡，迅速传遍全城。一旦哪家有人染上了瘟疫，就被封闭房门，贴上红十字。任何人不准踏出房门。只得呆在家里与病魔作斗争——或者等死。如果家境富裕，还是尽早搬离伦敦才为上策。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">During those years Will wrote a lot of poetry. He wrote his beautiful long poem, Venus and Adonis, for his friend Lord Southampton, and he wrote many of his famous short poems, the Sonnets. But they didn't go in a book; they were only for his friends to read.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些年间威尔创作了大量的诗歌。他写了诗体绮丽的长诗《维纳斯与阿童尼》献给好友索桑普敦勋爵，而且也创作了许多著名的短诗，十四行诗。但这些诗歌并没有编辑成书，只供朋友赏读。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One day, when we were back in London, I was reading some of his latest sonnets. Will was out somewhere, and I was at home in our lodgings in Bishopsgate. A lot of the poems were about a woman, a terrible, black-haired, black-eyed woman. She was cold and cruel, then she was true and loving, and then she was cruel again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们又回到伦敦后的一天，威尔出门去了，我一个人呆在“毕晓普门街”的公寓里，翻阅着他最新创作的一些十四行诗。这组诗大都描写一个女人，一个黑头发、黑眼睛的可怕的女人。她性情乖张善变，一会儿冷若冰霜，冷酷无情，一会儿又热情洋溢，真诚多情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The theatres in London didn't open again until June 1594. Will often visited Lord Southampton, but sometimes we went on tour with the company, or spent time at home in Stratford. Will began to spend more time in Stratford, because it was quiet there, and he could do his writing. I never heard what Anne thought about it all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伦敦的剧院到1594年6月才重新开放。威尔常去拜访索桑普敦勋爵，偶尔我们也随剧团到各地巡回演出，或者干脆呆在斯特拉福镇家中。威尔开始花更多的时间呆在斯特拉福镇，因为小镇的宁静，他可以安心搞创作。我从没听到安对此作何想法。">查看中文翻译</div>

She looked wild, and angry, and very, very beautiful.</div>
