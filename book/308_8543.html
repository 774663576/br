<div class="line_en">On the following morning I hurried unforgivably over my round. My excuse can be that I had no very serious cases to attend. On my return Caroline came into the hall to greet me.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“谢泼德医生，我有件事拜托你。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I don't think Flora really wished Caroline to be present at the interview. She would, I am sure, have infinitely preferred to speak to me privately. But she also wanted to waste no time, so she made the best of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我觉得弗洛拉其实并不愿意当着卡洛琳的面谈话，她肯定非常希望和我私聊。但她也没工夫再拖延，只能抓紧时间直入主题。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Flora was sitting on the sofa by the window. She was in black and she sat nervously twisting her hands together. I was shocked by the sight of her face. All the colour had faded away from it. But when she spoke her manner was as composed and resolute as possible.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弗洛拉坐在靠窗的沙发上，一袭黑衣，双手紧张地绞在一起。一见她的脸我就吓了一跳，她苍白的脸上没有一丝血色，但当她开口时，却还能勉强维持平静和果断的口吻。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I don't know what she was referring to -- possibly her own failure to discover the truth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我不清楚她指的是什么事——多半是自责未能早一步挖出真相吧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Why, he's Hercule Poirot! You know who I mean -- the private detective. They say he's done the most wonderful things -- just like detectives do in books. A year ago he retired and came to live down here. Uncle knew who he was, but he promised not to tell anyone, because M. Poirot wanted to live quietly without being bothered by people."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嗨，他是赫尔克里·波洛呀！你们知道我说的是谁吗？他是个私人侦探。人们都说他破获了好多了不起的案子——和小说里那些侦探一样。一年前他退休了，现在隐居在我们村子里。伯父知道他的真实身份，但答应不告诉任何人，因为波洛先生想过清闲日子，不愿意被人打扰。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm rather an old fogey, as Caroline tells me," I said," but I have just heard of him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“按卡洛琳的说法，我是个老古板，”我说，“不过这个人我还真的听说过。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I was not really being stupid. Caroline does not always understand what I am driving at.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我可真不傻。卡洛琳时常不理解我的用意。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You haven't got confidence in Inspector Davis?" I went on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“莫非你不信任戴维斯警督？”我接着问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And how do you know he would take up the case?" I asked. "Remember he has retired from active work."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那么你怎么知道他会愿意接手此案？”我问，“别忘了，他已经退休了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes," said Caroline grudgingly, "I see that."</div>

<div class="line_en">"That's just it," said Flora simply. "I've got to persuade him."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“您瞧，”随即她又采取迂回战术，“谢泼德医生毕竟是医生，而且又是尸体的发现者，他可以把所有细节都讲解给波洛先生听。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“连行李也不要了？”我温和地问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But that's just it," cried the girl. They do suspect him. A man from Cranchester turned up this morning -- Inspector Raglan, a horrid, weaselly little man. I found he had been to the Three Boars this morning before me. They told me all about his having been there, and the questions he had asked. He must think Ralph did it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“麻烦就在这里，”弗洛拉叫嚷着，“他们确实怀疑他了。今早从克兰切斯特来了个人——拉格伦警督，个头不高，贼眉鼠眼，不像个好人。我发现，今天上午他赶在我之前去过‘三只野猪’。他们把警督去过那儿的事、还有他问过的问题一五一十都告诉我了。他肯定认准凶手是拉尔夫。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No. I was astounded. I couldn't understand it. I went there and asked for him. They told me, what I suppose they told you last night, that he went out at about nine o'clock yesterday evening -- and -- and never came back." Her eyes met mine defiantly, and as though answering something in my look, she burst out: "Well, why shouldn't he? He might have gone anywhere. He may even have gone back to London."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊，当时我就惊呆了。我根本想不通，于是跑去找他，可他们告诉我——估计和昨晚对您的说法一样——他昨晚九点左右出去以后就⋯⋯就再也没回来。”她底气十足地与我对视片刻，随后像是要回答我目光中某种无声的疑问，猛然高喊：“好吧，他凭什么不能走？他可能是去了——随便去哪儿都行，甚至有可能回伦敦。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And that's why you want to go to Hercule Poirot? Isn't it better to leave things as they are? The police don't suspect Ralph in the least, remember. They're working on quite another tack."</div>

<div class="line_en">"It is completely unimportant," said Poirot. "That is why it is so interesting," he added softly.</div>

<div class="line_en">The butler drew the chair in question out a good two feet from the wall, turning it so that the seat faced the door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="男管家将那把椅子从墙边往外拖出足有两英尺，转了个角度，让椅子面对房门。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"About the chair, yes. Otherwise I do not know. You will find, M. Ie docteur, if you have much to do with cases of this kind, that they all resemble each other in one thing."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“就这把椅子而言，他没撒谎。其他我就不知道了。医生，如果你多接触几次这类案子的话，就会发现它们都有一个共同点。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Voila ce qui est curieux," murmured Poirot. "No one would want to sit in a chair in such a position, I fancy. Now who pushed it back into place again, I wonder? Did you, my friend?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这就怪了，”波洛喃喃道，“应该没人会坐在这个位置、这个角度。那我想知道，是谁把它推回原处的？是你吗，我的朋友？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It was back in position when I arrived with the police, sir," put in Parker. "I'm sure of that."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当我和警察一起返回时，椅子已被推回原处，”帕克插话说，“这一点我十分肯定。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Raymond or Blunt must have pushed it back," I suggested. "Surely it isn't important?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“肯定是雷蒙德或者布兰特推回去的，”我提醒他，“这肯定没什么要紧吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我失陪一会儿。”梅尔罗斯上校说完就和帕克一起离开了房间。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Curious," said Poirot again.</div>

<div class="line_en">"No, sir," said Parker. "I was too upset with seeing the master and all."</div>

<div class="line_en">"The window is then closed and bolted and the door unlocked. At a quater past ten when the body is discovered, the door is locked and the window is open. Who opened it?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Have you told me everything known to you about this young man Paton?" He smiled as I grew red. "Oh! do not fear. I will not press you. I shall learn it in good time."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“关于佩顿这个年轻人，你把知道的事情都告诉我了吗？”见我面红耳赤，他笑了，“哦，别紧张，我并不是逼你。时机到了我自然会搞清楚。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Have I?" I asked, smiling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那我呢？”我笑着问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What is that?" I asked curiously.</div>

<div class="line_en">"But --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可是——”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I wish you'd tell me something of your methods," I said hastily, to cover my confusion. "The point about the fire, for instance?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“希望你能告诉我你查案的方法，”我冒冒失失地说，好掩饰自己的一脸窘迫，“比如说，炉火的问题。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Everyone concerned in them has something to hide."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“卷入案件的每个人都有所隐瞒。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh! that was very simple. You leave Mr Ackroyd at -- ten minutes to nine, was it not?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“唔，很简单。你离开艾克罗伊德先生的时间是——八点五十分，对不对？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Clearly only Mr Ackroyd himself could have done so, and for one of two reasons. Either because the room became unbearably hot but since the fire was nearly out and there was a sharp drop in temperature last night, that cannot be the reason, or because he admitted someone that way. And if he admitted someone that way, it must have been someone well known to him, since he had previously shown himself uneasy on the subject of that same window."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“很明显，只能是艾克罗伊德先生本人。至于原因，只有两种：要么是因为屋子里热得受不了——但鉴于炉火已濒临熄灭，昨晚又气温骤降，这种可能性可以排除；第二种可能就是他将某人从窗口放进了屋子。如果他肯让人这样从窗子里进来，对方必定与他相当熟悉，因为之前他一直很关注同一扇窗户是否关紧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I think you have," he said quietly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我想你也有所保留。”他平静地说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Everything is simple, if you arrange the facts methodically. We are concerned now with the personality of the person who was with him at nine-thirty last night. Everything goes to show that that was the individual admitted by the window, and though Mr Ackroyd was seen alive later by Miss Flora, we cannot approach a solution of the mystery until we know who that visitor was. The window may have been left open after his departure and so afforded entrance to the murderer, or the same person may have returned a second time. Ah! here is the colonel who returns."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“如果你把各种事实有条不紊地串联起来，一切就都很明显了。现在我们关心的是昨晚九点半和他待在一起的究竟是谁。所有迹象都表明，这个人是从窗户进来的；而且，虽然此后弗洛拉小姐来见艾克罗伊德先生时他还活着，我们仍然需要揭开这名访客的面纱才能查清真相。很可能他离开后窗户依然开着，便给了凶手乘虚而入的机会；又或者是这同一个人再次返回。啊，上校回来了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“终于查到那通电话了。”他说，“不是从这儿打出去的，而是昨晚十点十五分，从金斯艾伯特车站一个公用电话亭打到谢泼德医生家里的。十点二十三分，有一趟夜班邮车启程开往利物浦。”">查看中文翻译</div>
