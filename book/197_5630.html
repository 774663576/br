<div class="line_en">Mrs. Weasley fussed over the state of his socks and tried to force him to eat fourth helpings at every meal. Mr. Weasley liked Harry to sit next to him at the dinner table so that he could bombard him with questions about life with Muggles, asking him to explain how things like plugs and the postal service worked.</div>

<div class="line_en">Life at the Burrow was as different as possible from life on Privet Drive. The Dursleys liked everything neat and ordered; the Weasleys' house burst with the strange and unexpected. Harry got a shock the first time he looked in the mirror over the kitchen mantelpiece and it shouted, "Tuck your shirt in, scruffy!" The ghoul in the attic howled and dropped pipes whenever he felt things were getting too quiet, and small explosions from Fred and George's bedroom were considered perfectly normal. What Harry found most unusual about life at Ron's, however, wasn't the talking mirror or the clanking ghoul: It was the fact that everybody there seemed to like him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="陋居的生活和女贞路的生活有着天壤之别。德思礼一家人喜欢一切都井井有条，韦斯莱家却充满神奇和意外。厨房壁炉架上的那面镜子就把哈利吓了一跳。他第一次照镜子时，镜子突然大叫起来：“把衬衫塞到裤腰里去，邋里邋遢！”阁楼上的食尸鬼只要觉得家里太安静了，就高声嚎叫，咣啷咣啷地敲管子。弗雷德和乔治卧室中小小的爆炸声被认为是完全正常的。但是在哈利看来，罗恩家的生活最不寻常的地方不是会说话的镜子，也不是敲敲打打的食尸鬼，而是这里所有的人好像都很喜欢他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Letters from school," said Mr. Weasley, passing Harry and Ron identical envelopes of yellowish parchment, addressed in green ink. "Dumbledore already knows you're here, Harry -- doesn't miss a trick, that man. You two've got them, too," he added, as Fred and George ambled in, still in their pajamas.</div>

<div class="line_en">For a few minutes there was silence as they all read their letters. Harry's told him to catch the Hogwarts Express as usual from King's Cross station on September first. There was also a list of the new books he'd need for the coming year.</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry heard from Hogwarts one sunny morning about a week after he had arrived at the Burrow. He and Ron went down to breakfast to find Mr. and Mrs. Weasley and Ginny already sitting at the kitchen table. The moment she saw Harry, Ginny accidentally knocked her porridge bowl to the floor with a loud clatter. Ginny seemed very prone to knocking things over whenever Harry entered a room. She dived under the table to retrieve the bowl and emerged with her face glowing like the setting sun. Pretending he hadn't noticed this, Harry sat down and took the toast Mrs. Weasley offered him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到陋居大约一星期后，在一个晴朗的早晨，哈利收到了霍格沃茨的来信。那天他和罗恩下楼吃早饭，发现韦斯莱夫妇和金妮已经坐在餐桌旁了。金妮一看见哈利，不小心把她的粥碗碰翻在地，弄出了很大的响声。好像每次哈利一进屋，金妮总要碰倒什么东西。她钻到桌子底下去捡碗，出来时脸红得像晚霞一样。哈利装做没看见，坐了下来，接过韦斯莱夫人递给他的面包片。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry, Ron, Fred, and George were planning to go up the hill to a small paddock the Weasleys owned. It was surrounded by trees that blocked it from view of the village below, meaning that they could practice Quidditch there, as long as they didn't fly too high. They couldn't use real Quidditch balls, which would have been hard to explain if they had escaped and flown away over the village; instead they threw apples for one another to catch. They took turns riding Harry's Nimbus Two Thousand, which was easily the best broom; Ron's old Shooting Star was often outstripped by passing butterflies.</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry said nothing. He felt a bit awkward. Stored in an underground vault at Gringotts in London was a small fortune that his parents had left him. Of course, it was only in the wizarding world that he had money; you couldn't use Galleons, Sickles, and Knuts in Muggle shops. He had never mentioned his Gringotts bank account to the Dursleys; he didn't think their horror of anything connected with magic would stretch to a large pile of gold. Mrs. Weasley woke them all early the following Wednesday. After a quick half a dozen bacon sandwiches each, they pulled on their coats and Mrs. Weasley took a flowerpot off the kitchen mantelpiece and peered inside.</div>

<div class="line_en">A glass case nearby held a withered hand on a cushion, a bloodstained pack of cards, and a staring glass eye. Evil-looking masks stared down from the walls, an assortment of human bones lay upon the counter, and rusty, spiked instruments hung from the ceiling.

There was a very small pile of silver Sickles inside, and just one gold Galleon. Mrs. Weasley felt right into the corners before sweeping the whole lot into her bag.

The bag of gold, silver, and bronze jangling cheerfully in Harry's pocket was clamoring to be spent, so he bought three large strawberry-and-peanut-butter ice creams, which they slurped happily as they wandered up the alley, examining the fascinating shop windows. Ron gazed longingly at a full set of Chudley Cannon robes in the windows of Quality Quidditch Supplies until Hermione dragged them off to buy ink and parchment next door. In Gambol and Japes Wizarding Joke Shop, they met Fred, George, and Lee Jordan, who were stocking up on Dr. Filibuster's Fabulous Wet-Start, No-Heat Fireworks, and in a tiny junk shop full of broken wands, lopsided brass scales, and old cloaks covered in potion stains they found Percy, deeply immersed in a small and deeply boring book called Prefects Who Gained Power.</div>
