<div class="line_en">The learned man from the cold lands he was a young man, and seemed to be a clever man sat in a glowing oven; it took effect on him, he became quite meagre even his shadow shrunk in, for the sun had also an effect on it. It was first towards evening when the sun was down, that they began to freshen up again.</div>

The narrow street with the high houses, was built so that the sunshine must fall there from morning till evening it was really not to be borne.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="像一切有理智的人一样，他得待在家里，把百叶窗和门整天都关起来，这看起来好像整屋子的人都在睡觉或者家里没有一个人似的。他所住的那条有许多高房子的狭小街道，建筑得恰恰使太阳从早到晚都照在它上面。这真叫人吃不消！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="在热带的国度里，太阳晒得非常厉害。人们都给晒成棕色，像桃花心木一样；在最热的国度里，人们就给晒成了黑人。不过现在有一位住在寒带的学者偏偏要到这些热的国家里来。他以为自己可以在这些国家里面漫游一番，像在本国一样，不过不多久他就改变了看法。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the warm lands every window has a balcony, and the people came out on all the balconies in the street for one must have air, even if one be accustomed to be mahogany! It was lively both up and down the street. Tailors, and shoemakers, and all the folks, moved out into the street chairs and tables were brought forth and candles burnt yes, above a thousand lights were burning and the one talked and the other sung; and people walked and church-bells rang, and asses went along with a dingle-dingle-dong! for they too had bells on. The street boys were screaming and hooting, and shouting and shooting, with devils and detonating balls and there came corpse bearers and hood wearers for there were funerals with psalm and hymn and then the din of carriages driving and company arriving: yes, it was, in truth, lively enough down in the street. Only in that single house, which stood opposite that in which the learned foreigner lived, it was quite still; and yet some one lived there, for there stood flowers in the balcony they grew so well in the sun's heat! and that they could not do unless they were watered and some one must water them there must be somebody there. The door opposite was also opened late in the evening, but it was dark within, at least in the front room; further in there was heard the sound of music. The learned foreigner thought it quite marvellous, but now it might be that he only imagined it for he found everything marvellous out there, in the warm lands, if there had only been no sun. The stranger's landlord said that he didn't know who had taken the house opposite, one saw no person about, and as to the music, it appeared to him to be extremely tiresome. "It is as if some one sat there, and practised a piece that he could not master always the same piece. 'I shall master it!' says he; but yet he cannot master it, however long he plays."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这些街上所有的阳台上面——在热带的国家里，每个窗子上都有一个阳台——现在都有人走出来了，因为人们到底要呼吸些新鲜空气，即使要变成桃花心木的颜色也管不了。这时上上下下都显得生气勃勃起来。鞋匠啦，裁缝啦，在家都搬到街上来。桌子和椅子也被搬出来了；蜡烛也点起来了——是的，不止一千根蜡烛。这个人聊天，那个人唱歌；人们散步，马车奔驰，驴子走路——丁当——丁当——丁当！因为它们身上都戴着铃铛。死人在圣诗声中入了土；野孩子在放焰火；教堂的钟声在响。的确，街上充满了活跃的空气。只有在那位外国学者住所对面的一间房子里，一切是沉寂的。但是那里面却住着一个人，因为阳台上有好几棵花。这些花儿在太阳光中长得非常美丽。如果没有人浇水，它们决不会长得这样好的；所以一定有什么人在那儿为它们浇水，因此一定有人住在那儿。天黑的时候，那儿的门也打开了，但是里面却很黑暗，最低限度前房是如此。更朝里一点有音乐飘出来。这位外国学者认为这音乐很美妙，不过这可能只是他的幻想，因为他发现在这些热带的国家里面，什么东西都是顶美丽的——如果没有太阳的话。这位外国人的房东说，他不知道谁租了对面的房子——那里从来没有任何人出现过；至于那音乐，他觉得单调之至。他说：“好像有某个人坐在那儿，老是练习他弹不好的一个调子——一个不变的调子。他似乎在说：‘我终究要学会它。’但是不管他弹多久，他老是学不会。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One night the stranger awoke he slept with the doors of the balcony open the curtain before it was raised by the wind, and he thought that a strange lustre came from the opposite neighbor's house; all the flowers shone like flames, in the most beautiful colors, and in the midst of the flowers stood a slender, graceful maiden it was as if she also shone; the light really hurt his eyes. He now opened them quite wide yes, he was quite awake; with one spring he was on the floor; he crept gently behind the curtain, but the maiden was gone; the flowers shone no longer, but there they stood, fresh and blooming as ever; the door was ajar, and, far within, the music sounded so soft and delightful, one could really melt away in sweet thoughts from it. Yet it was like a piece of enchantment. And who lived there? Where was the actual entrance? The whole of the ground-floor was a row of shops, and there people could not always be running through.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个外国人有天晚上醒来了。他是睡在敞开的阳台门口的。风把它前面的帘子掀开，于是他就幻想自己看见一道奇异的光从对面的阳台上射来。所有的花都亮起来了，很像色彩鲜艳的火焰。在这些花儿中间立着一位美丽苗条的姑娘。她也似乎射出一道光来。这的确刺伤他的眼睛。不过这是因为他从睡梦中惊醒时把眼睛睁得太大了的缘故。他一翻身就跳到地上来了。他轻轻地走到帘子后面去，但是那个姑娘却不见了，光也没有了，花儿也不再闪亮，只是立在那儿，像平时一样地好看。那扇门还是半掩着，从里面飘出一阵音乐声——那么柔和，那么美妙，使人一听到它就沉浸到甜美的幻想中去。这真妤像是一个幻境。但是谁住在那儿呢？真正的入口是在什么地方呢？因为最下面一层全是店铺，人们不能老是随便从这些铺子进出的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One evening the stranger sat out on the balcony. The light burnt in the room behind him; and thus it was quite natural that his shadow should fall on his opposite neighbor's wall. Yes! there it sat, directly opposite, between the flowers on the balcony; and when the stranger moved, the shadow also moved: for that it always does.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一天晚上，这位外国人坐在他的阳台上。在他后边的那个房间里点着灯，因此他的影子很自然地就射到对面屋子的墙上去了。它的确正坐在那个阳台上的花丛中间。当这外国人动一下的时候，他的影子也就动一下。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I think my shadow is the only living thing one sees over there," said the learned man. "See, how nicely it sits between the flowers. The door stands half-open: now the shadow should be cunning, and go into the room, look about, and then come and tell me what it had seen. Come, now! Be useful, and do me a service," said he, in jest. "Have the kindness to step in. Now! Art thou going?" and then he nodded to the shadow, and the shadow nodded again. "Well then, go! But don't stay away."</div>

<div class="line_en">The stranger rose, and his shadow on the opposite neighbor's balcony rose also; the stranger turned round and the shadow also turned round.

<div class="line_en">This annoyed him: not so much because the shadow was gone, but because he knew there was a story about a man without a shadow.* It was known to everybody at home, in the cold lands; and if the learned man now came there and told his story, they would say that he was imitating it, and that he had no need to do. He would, therefore, not talk about it at all; and that was wisely thought.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这使他烦恼起来，并不完全是因为他的影子不见了，而是因为他知道一个关于没有影子的人的故事。住在寒带国度里的家乡人都知道这个故事。如果这位学者回到家里、把自己的故事讲出来的话，大家将会说这是他模仿那个故事编出来的。他不愿意人们这样议论他。因此他就打算完全不提这事情——这是一个合理的想法。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the evening he went out again on the balcony. He had placed the light directly behind him, for he knew that the shadow would always have its master for a screen, but he could not entice it. He made himself little; he made himself great: but no shadow came again. He said, "Hem! hem!" but it was of no use.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="晚上他又走到他的阳台上来，他已经把烛灯仔细地在他后面放好，因为他知道影子总是需要它的主人作为掩护的，但是他没有办法把它引出来。他把自己变小，把自己扩大，但是影子却没有产生，因此也没有影子走出来。他说：“出来！出来！”但是这一点用也没有。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was vexatious; but in the warm lands everything grows so quickly; and after the lapse of eight days he observed, to his great joy, that a new shadow came in the sunshine. In the course of three weeks he had a very fair shadow, which, when he set out for his home in the northern lands, grew more and more in the journey, so that at last it was so long and so large, that it was more than sufficient.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这真使人苦恼。不过在热带的国度里，一切东西都长得非常快。过了一个星期以后，有一件事使他非常高兴：他发现当他走到太阳光里去的时候，一个新的影子从他的腿上生出来了。他身上一定有一个影子的根。三个星期以后，他已经有了一个相当可观的影子了。当他动身回到他的北国去的时候，影子在路上更长了许多；到后来它长得又高又大，就是去掉它半截也没有关系。">查看中文翻译</div>

I have, in all respects, become very well off. Shall I purchase my freedom from service? If so, I can do it"; and then he rattled a whole bunch of valuable seals that hung to his watch, and he stuck his hand in the thick gold chain he wore around his neck nay! how all his fingers glittered with diamond rings; and then all were pure gems.</div>

As soon as you found I was capable to go out alone in the world, I went my own way. I am in the most brilliant circumstances, but there came a sort of desire over me to see you once more before you die; you will die, I suppose?

And besides, I learned to know my inward nature, my innate qualities, the relationship I had with Poesy. At the time I was with you, I thought not of that, but always you know it well when the sun rose, and when the sun went down, I became so strangely great; in the moonlight I was very near being more distinct than yourself; at that time I did not understand my nature; it was revealed to me in the antechamber! I became a man! I came out matured; but you were no longer in the warm lands; as a man I was ashamed to go as I did. I was in want of boots, of clothes, of the whole human varnish that makes a man perceptible. I took my way I tell it to you, but you will not put it in any book I took my way to the cake woman I hid myself behind her; the woman didn't think how much she concealed. I went out first in the evening; I ran about the streets in the moonlight; I made myself long up the walls it tickles the back so delightfully! I ran up, and ran down, peeped into the highest windows, into the saloons, and on the roofs, I peeped in where no one could peep, and I saw what no one else saw, what no one else should see! This is, in fact, a base world! I would not be a man if it were not now once accepted and regarded as something to be so!</div>
