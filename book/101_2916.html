<div class="line_en">Jess knew now that he would never be the best runner of the fourth and fifth grades, and his only consolation was that neither would Gary Fulcher. They went through the motions of the contest on Friday, but when it was over and Leslie had won again, everyone sort of knew without saying so that it was the end of the races.</div>

<div class="line_en">Because school had started on the first Tuesday after Labor Day, it was a short week. It was a good thing because each day was worse than the day before. Leslie continued to join the boys at recess, and every day she won. By Friday a number of the fourth- and fifth-grade boys had already drifted away to play King of the Mountain on the slope between the two fields. Since there were only a handful left, they didn't even have to have heats, which took away a lot of the suspense. Running wasn't fun anymore. And it was all Leslie's fault.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="由于是在劳动节后的第一个星期二开学，所以这是很短的一周。这是件好事，因为每一天都比前一天糟糕。莱斯利每次休息的时间都参加赛跑，而且每天都赢。到了星期五，很多四、五年级的男生已经离开去场地中间的斜坡上玩“山丘之王”的游戏了。现在跑步的人已经很少了，他们甚至不需要组织小组赛了，这让比赛少了很多悬念。跑步不再像从前那么有意思了。而这一切都是莱斯利的错。【注：美国劳动节是每年9月的第一个星期一。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At least it was Friday, and Miss Edmunds was back. The fifth grade had music right after recess. Jess had passed Miss Edmunds in the hall earlier in the day, and she had stopped him and made a fuss over him. "Did you keep drawing this summer?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Miss Edmunds fiddled a minute with her guitar, talking as she tightened the strings to the jingling of her bracelets and the thrumming of chords. She was in her jeans as usual and sat there cross-legged in front of them as though that was the way teachers always did. She asked a few of the kids how they were and how their summer had been. They kind of mumbled back. She didn't speak directly to Jess, but she gave him a look with those blue eyes of hers that made him zing like one of the strings she was strumming.</div>

<div class="line_en">People began to join in, quietly at first to match her mood, but as the song built up at the end, their voices did as well, so that by the time they got to the final "Free to be you and me," the whole school could hear them. Caught in the pure delight of it, Jess turned and his eyes met Leslie's. He smiled at her. What the heck? There wasn't any reason he couldn't. What was he scared of anyhow? Lord. Sometimes he acted like the original yellow-bellied sapsucker. He nodded and smiled again. She smiled back. He felt there in the teachers' room that it was the beginning of a new season in his life, and he chose deliberately to make it so.</div>

<div class="line_en">It started with Mrs. Myers reading out loud a composition that Leslie had written about her hobby. Everyone had to write a paper about his or her favorite hobby. Jess had written about football, which he really hated, but he had enough brains to know that if he said drawing, everyone would laugh at him. Most of the boys swore that watching the Washington Redskins on TV was their favorite hobby. The girls were divided: those who didn't care much about what Mrs. Myers thought chose watching game shows on TV, and those like Wanda Kay Moore who were still aiming for A's chose reading Good Books. But Mrs. Myers didn't read anyone's paper out loud except Leslie's.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这件事源于梅耶斯夫人当众大声朗读了莱斯利的一篇关于爱好的作文。每个人都得写一篇关于自己最喜欢的爱好的文章。杰斯写的是踢足球，实际上他讨厌足球，但他还是有点脑子的，如果他写画画的话，每个人都会嘲笑他。大多说的男孩都声称在电视上观看华盛顿红人队的比赛是他们最大的爱好。而女孩们则大体分为两类：一些不太在意梅耶斯夫人看法的的人选择了写看电视上的娱乐秀，而那些像旺达·凯·摩尔这样目标是得A的女孩则写的是读优秀的书籍。但是梅耶斯夫人并没有大声朗读任何一个人的作文，除了莱斯利的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mrs. Myers' sharp voice cut Leslie's sentences into funny little phrases, but even so, the power of Leslie's words drew Jess with her under the dark water. Suddenly he could hardly breathe. Suppose you went under and your mask filled all up with water and you couldn't get to the top in time? He was choking and sweating. He tried to push down his panic. This was Leslie Burke's favorite hobby. Nobody would make up scuba diving to be their favorite hobby if it wasn't so. That meant Leslie did it a lot. That she wasn't scared of going deep, deep down in a world of no air and little light. Lord, he was such a coward. How could he be all in a tremble just listening to Mrs. Myers read about it? He was worse a baby than Joyce Ann. His dad expected him to be a man. And here he was letting some girl who wasn't even ten yet scare the liver out of him by just telling what it was like to sight-see underwater. Dumb, dumb, dumb.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="梅耶斯夫人的尖嗓门把莱斯利的句子分割成一个个滑稽的短语，但即使这样，莱斯利的文字还是把杰斯带到了漆黑的水底。突然他感到呼吸困难。假如你在沉下去，呼吸面具里充满了水，而且不能及时到达水面会怎么样？他开始觉得窒息、出汗。他试图从恐慌中平静下来。这居然是莱斯利·伯克最喜欢的爱好。如果一个人不喜欢潜水，他一定不会把它作为自己的爱好。这意味着莱斯利潜过很多次。她居然不怕到一个很深很深、没有空气和一点亮光的世界。老天啊，他真是个胆小鬼。他怎么能因为梅耶斯夫人的朗读就颤栗不已呢？他甚至不如像乔伊丝·安这样的婴儿。他的父亲希望他能成为一个男子汉。而他现在却被一个不到十岁的女孩陈述的水底景象吓破了胆。傻瓜，傻瓜，傻瓜。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At first they avoided each other during school hours, but by October they grew careless about their friendship. Gary Fulcher, like Brenda, took great pleasure in teasing Jess about his "girl friend." It hardly bothered Jess. He knew that a girl friend was somebody who chased you on the playground and tried to grab you and kiss you. He could no more imagine Leslie chasing a boy than he could imagine Mrs. Double-Chinned Myers shinnying up the flagpole. Gary Fulcher could go to you-know-where and warm his toes.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jess could hardly keep a straight face in class just trying to imagine what might be going on behind that angelic look of Leslie's. One whole morning, as Leslie had related it at recess, she had spent imagining Mrs. Myers on one of those fat farms down in Arizona. In her fantasy, Mrs. Myers was one of the foodaholics who would hide bits of candy bars in odd places -- up the hot water faucet!-- only to be found out and publicly humiliated before all the other fat ladies. That afternoon Jess kept having visions of Mrs. Myers dressed only in a pink corset being weighed in. "You've been cheating again, Gussie!" the tall skinny directoress was saying. Mrs. Myers was on the verge of tears.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰斯在课堂很难正眼看到她，只能试想莱斯利在她那天使般的面容下正想些什么。莱斯利后来在课间休息的时候告诉他，整个早晨，她都在想像梅耶斯夫人站在亚利桑那州的那些肥沃的农场上。在她奇妙的脑海中，梅耶斯夫人是那种一个暴饮暴食狂，会把大量的棒棒糖藏在奇怪地地方——甚至热水的水龙头里！——结果却被发现了，因而在其他的肥胖女士们面前被当众羞辱。而那天下午，杰斯一直都在幻想梅耶斯夫人穿着粉红色的紧身束腰去称体重。“你又做弊了，格西！”瘦高的女医生说道。梅耶斯夫人都快要流出眼泪了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was really no free time at school except recess, and now that there were no races, Jess and Leslie usually looked for a quiet place on the field, and sat and talked. Except for the magic half hour on Fridays, recess was all that Jess looked forward to at school. Leslie could always come up with something funny that made the long days bearable. Often the joke was on Mrs. Myers. Leslie was one of those people who sat quietly at her desk, never whispering or daydreaming or chewing gum, doing beautiful schoolwork, and yet her brain was so full of mischief that if the teacher could have once seen through that mask of perfection, she would have thrown her out in horror.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在学校里除了课间休息就没有什么自由支配的时间了，而现在休息的时候也没有人跑步了。杰斯和莱斯利通常会在场地上找一个安静的地方坐下来闲聊。除了周五那魔幻般的半小时，课间就是杰斯在学校里唯一期待的事了。莱斯利总能想出一些有趣的东西来让漫长的一天变得可以忍受。他们开的玩笑经常是跟梅耶斯夫人有关的。莱斯利属于这样一种人——安安静静地坐在座位上，从不窃窃私语、做白日梦、嚼口香糖，完成漂亮的家庭作业，但她的脑子里装满了恶作剧，如果老师能看透她完美的面具，她一定会惊恐地把她扔出去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes'm." He was going to have to get coaching from Leslie. Mrs. Myers always caught him when his mind was on vacation, but she never seemed to suspect Leslie of not paying attention. He sneaked a glance up that way. Leslie was totally absorbed in her geography book, or so it would appear to anyone who didn't know.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，老师。”看来他得让莱斯利好好辅导一下了。梅耶斯夫人总能在他开小差的时候逮到他，但她似乎却从不会认为莱斯利没有注意听讲。他朝莱斯利那瞟了一眼。她似乎完全专注于地理课本，至少不会被不知情的人发现。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Terabithia was cold in November. They didn't dare build a fire in the castle, though sometimes they would build one outside and huddle around it. For a while Leslie had been able to keep two sleeping bags in the stronghold, but around the first of December her father noticed their absence, and she had to take them back. Actually, Jess made her take them back. It was not that he was afraid of the Burkes exactly. Leslie's parents were young, with straight white teeth and lots of hair -- both of them. Leslie called them Judy and Bill, which bothered Jess more than he wanted it to. It was none of his business what Leslie called her parents. But he just couldn't get used to it.</div>

<div class="line_en">They didn't look like Jess's idea of rich, but even he could tell that the jeans they wore had not come off the counter at Newberry's. There was no TV at the Burkes', but there were mountains of records and a stereo set that looked like something off Star Trek. And although their car was small and dusty, it was Italian and looked expensive, too.</div>

<div class="line_en">Both of the Burkes were writers. Mrs. Burke wrote novels and, according to Leslie, was more famous than Mr. Burke, who wrote about politics. It was really something to see the shelf that had their books on it. Mrs. Burke was "Judith Hancock" on the cover, which threw you at first, but then if you looked on the back, there was her picture looking very young and serious. Mr. Burke was going back and forth to Washington to finish a book he was working on with someone else, but he had promised Leslie that after Christmas he would stay home and fix up the house and plant his garden and listen to music and read books out loud and write only in his spare time.</div>

<div class="line_en">Later she would refer to Leslie's "tacky" clothes. Leslie always wore pants, even to school. Her hair was "shorter than a boy's." Her parents were "hardly more than hippies." May Belle either tried to push in with him and Leslie or sulked at being left out.

<div class="line_en">Terabithia was their secret, which was a good thing, for how could Jess have ever explained it to an outsider? Just walking down the hill toward the woods made something warm and liquid steal through his body. The closer he came to the dry creek bed and the crab apple tree rope the more he could feel the beating of his heart. He grabbed the end of the rope and swung out toward the other bank with a kind of wild exhilaration and landed gently on his feet, taller and stronger and wiser in that mysterious land.</div>

<div class="line_en">At first he heard only the stillness. It was the stillness that had always frightened him before, but this time it was like the moment after Miss Edmunds finished a song, just after the chords hummed down to silence. Leslie was right. They stood there, not moving, not wanting the swish of dry needles beneath their feet to break the spell. Far away from their former world came the cry of geese heading southward.</div>
