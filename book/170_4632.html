<div class="line_en">Swaying in his wicker basket on Hodor's back, the boy hunched down, ducking his head as the big stableboy passed beneath the limb of an oak. The snow was falling again, wet and heavy. Hodor walked with one eye frozen shut, his thick brown beard a tangle of hoarfrost, icicles drooping from the ends of his bushy mustache. One gloved hand still clutched the rusty iron longsword he had taken from the crypts below Winterfell, and from time to time he would lash out at a branch, knocking loose a spray of snow. "Hod-d-d-dor," he would mutter, his teeth chattering.</div>

<div class="line_en">Are we there yet? Bran never said the words aloud, but they were often on his lips as their ragged company trudged through groves of ancient oaks and towering grey-green sentinels, past gloomy soldier pines and bare brown chestnut trees. Are we near? the boy would wonder, as Hodor clambered up a stony slope, or descended into some dark crevice where drifts of dirty snow cracked beneath his feet. How much farther? he would think, as the great elk splashed across a half-frozen stream. How much longer? It's so cold. Where is the three-eyed crow?</div>

<div class="line_en">The sound was strangely reassuring. On their journey from Winterfell to the Wall, Bran and his companions had made the miles shorter by talking and telling tales, but it was different here. Even Hodor felt it. His hodors came less often than they had south of the Wall. There was a stillness to this wood like nothing Bran had ever known before. Before the snows began, the north wind would swirl around them and clouds of dead brown leaves would kick up from the ground with a faint small rustling sound that reminded him of roaches scurrying in a cupboard, but now all the leaves were buried under a blanket of white. From time to time a raven would fly overhead, big black wings slapping against the cold air. Elsewise the world was silent.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这声音带来了一种奇特的安全感。从临冬城到长城途中，布兰一行人靠讲故事来消磨时光；然而长城之外有所不同，这点连阿多也感觉到了——他念“阿多”的次数比起在长城南边少了许多。这片森林里有种布兰从未体验过的寂寥。在大雪降下之前，北风围着他们打旋，卷起一团一一团一死去的褐色枯叶，发出轻微的瑟瑟声，令他想起碗柜里爬行的蟑螂；大雪之后，树叶又都被白色的厚毯子埋葬。时而有乌鸦掠过头顶，巨大的黑翅膀扇动冰冷的空气。除此之外，一片沉寂。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Just ahead, the elk wove between the snowdrifts with his head down, his huge rack of antlers crusted with ice. The ranger sat astride his broad back, grim and silent. Coldhands was the name that the fat boy Sam had given him, for though the ranger's face was pale, his hands were black and hard as iron, and cold as iron too. The rest of him was wrapped in layers of wool and boiled leather and ringmail, his features shadowed by his hooded cloak and a black woolen scarf about the lower half of his face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="麋鹿走在前方不远处，埋头在雪堆里穿行，巨大的分叉鹿角上也挂着冰霜。游骑兵坐在它宽阔的背上，神情严肃沉默。胖男孩山姆称这个游骑兵为“冷手”，因为他面孔苍白，双手漆黑，冷硬如铁。除了手和脸，他把自己包一皮裹在层层羊毛、熟皮衣和环甲里，而拉起的兜帽斗篷和围住下半边脸的黑羊毛围巾又遮掩了他的面容。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Summer brought up the rear of their little band. The direwolf's breath frosted the forest air as he padded after them, still limping on the hind leg that had taken the arrow back at Queenscrown. Bran felt the pain of the old wound whenever he slipped inside the big wolf's skin. Of late Bran wore Summer's body more often than his own; the wolf felt the bite of the cold, despite the thickness of his fur, but he could see farther and hear better and smell more than the boy in the basket, bundled up like a babe in swaddling clothes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="夏天担任这支小队伍的后卫，拖着脚步尾随——他后腿上仍带着在后冠镇所受的箭伤——不时呼出结霜的森林空气。只要布兰进入冰原狼体内，就能感受到旧伤口的痛楚。近来，布兰进入夏天体内的次数越来越多。一身厚毛的狼虽然也冷，但看得更远、听得更真切、嗅觉更敏锐，比那个像襁褓里的婴儿一样无助的男孩要好得多。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Other times, when he was tired of being a wolf, Bran slipped into Hodor's skin instead. The gentle giant would whimper when he felt him, and thrash his shaggy head from side to side, but not as violently as he had the first time, back at Queenscrown. He knows it's me, the boy liked to tell himself. He's used to me by now. Even so, he never felt comfortable inside Hodor's skin. The big stableboy never understood what was happening, and Bran could taste the fear at the back of his mouth. It was better inside Summer. I am him, and he is me. He feels what I feel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="也有些时候，布兰厌倦了做狼，便进入阿多体内。一温一驯的巨人察觉到他的存在时，会呜呜哀叫，会摇晃毛发蓬乱的脑袋，但反应不若在后冠镇他第一次进入时那么激烈。他知道是我，男孩安慰自己，他习惯了我。不过，在阿多体内他待不舒服。大个子马童根本不理解身边发生的事，布兰能尝到他嘴里的恐惧。还是在夏天体内好。我就是他，他就是我。他跟我心意相通。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Behind the ranger, Meera Reed wrapped her arms around her brother, to shelter him from the wind and cold with the warmth of her own body. A crust of frozen snot had formed below Jojen's nose, and from time to time he shivered violently. He looks so small, Bran thought, as he watched him sway. He looks smaller than me now, and weaker too, and I'm the cripple.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="梅拉·黎德走在游骑兵后面，用胳膊环着弟弟，既是为他遮挡风雨，又是在用自己的体一温一一温一暖他。玖健的鼻涕在鼻子下面凝结成块，他时而剧烈地颤一抖。他看起来好小哦，布兰在摇晃的篮子里边看边想，似乎比我还小、比我还弱——我可是个残废呢。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sometimes Bran could sense the direwolf sniffing after the elk, wondering if he could bring the great beast down. Summer had grown accustomed to horses at Winterfell, but this was an elk and elk were prey. The direwolf could sense the warm blood coursing beneath the elk's shaggy hide. Just the smell was enough to make the slaver run from between his jaws, and when it did Bran's mouth would water at the thought of rich, dark meat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布兰偶尔能感应到冰原狼尾随在麋鹿后面嗅探，盘算如何将这头大动物扑倒。夏天在临冬城习惯了与马儿们和平共处，但这是麋鹿，麋鹿是猎物。冰原狼觉察到麋鹿蓬乱的毛皮下流淌的一温一暖血液，仅是这味道已足以让他齿间滴下唾液，连布兰想到丰润厚实的肉，也不禁会垂涎欲滴。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">From a nearby oak a raven quorked, and Bran heard the sound of wings as another of the big black birds flapped down to land beside it. By day only half a dozen ravens stayed with them, flitting from tree to tree or riding on the antlers of the elk. The rest of the murder flew ahead or lingered behind. But when the sun sank low they would return, descending from the sky on night-black wings until every branch of every tree was thick with them for yards around. Some would fly to the ranger and mutter at him, and it seemed to Bran that he understood their quorks and squawks. They are his eyes and ears. They scout for him, and whisper to him of dangers ahead and behind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从附近某棵橡树上，传来乌鸦的尖一叫，接着布兰听见另一只大黑鸟拍拍翅膀停在同伴身边。白天只有六、七只乌鸦会紧跟他们，它们在树木之间飞来飞去，或停在麋鹿的角上，其他乌鸦都飞到了前面或是落在后头；但等太陽沉没，乌鸦们会统统飞回来，扇动漆黑如夜的翅膀自夜空中下降，直到周围每棵树、每根枝条都被它们站满。有的乌鸦会飞向游骑兵，朝他低声嘀咕，布兰觉得游骑兵能听懂鸟儿的聒噪。它们是他的耳目，它们在为他侦察，向他汇报前方后方可能的危险…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“怎么了？”梅拉问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As now. The elk stopped suddenly, and the ranger vaulted lightly from his back to land in knee-deep snow. Summer growled at him, his fur bristling. The direwolf did not like the way that Coldhands smelled. Dead meat, dry blood, a faint whiff of rot. And cold. Cold over all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="比如现在。麋鹿突然停住，游骑兵从它背上一跃而下，落在及膝深的雪中。夏天冲他咆哮，毛发直竖。冰原狼一直不喜欢冷手的味道。死肉，干血，一丝腐败。还有冷，包一皮裹一切的寒冷。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Behind us," Coldhands announced, his voice muffled by the black wool scarf across his nose and mouth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“后面有情况，”冷手宣布，他的声音隔着围住鼻子嘴巴的黑羊毛围巾听来有些闷。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Wolves?" Bran asked. They had known for days that they were being followed. Every night they heard the mournful howling of the pack, and every night the wolves seemed a little closer. Hunters, and hungry. They can smell how weak we are. Often Bran woke shivering hours before the dawn, listening to the sound of them calling to one another in the distance as he waited for the sun to rise. If there are wolves, there must be prey, he used to think, until it came to him that they were the prey.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是狼吗？”布兰问。狼群已跟踪了他们好多天，每晚都能听见狼群的哀嚎，每晚狼群都离他们更近。它们是饥俄的猎人，能闻出我们有多虚弱。布兰常在黎明前的几个小时颤一抖着醒来，听着风中传递的遥远狼嗥声，不安地等待太陽升起。有狼的地方就有猎物，这是常识，接着他惊恐地发现他们自己就是猎物。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Bran thought that Meera meant to argue until her brother said, "Do as he says. He knows this land." Jojen's eyes were a dark green, the color of moss, but heavy with a weariness that Bran had never seen in them before. The little grandfather. South of the Wall, the boy from the crannogs had seemed to be wise beyond his years, but up here he was as lost and frightened as the rest of them. Even so, Meera always listened to him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="梅拉还待再辩，但她弟弟劝阻道：“照他说的做。他很熟悉这片土地。”玖健的眼睛是深绿色，青苔的颜色，然而眼神中带着布兰之前从未见过的深深倦意。小个子祖父。在长城南边，泽地男孩似乎拥有超越年龄的智慧；但在这里，他跟其他人一样迷茫恐惧。即便如此，梅拉也总是听他的话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That was still true. Coldhands slipped between the trees, back the way they'd come, with four ravens flapping after him. Meera watched him go, her cheeks red with cold, breath puffing from her nostrils. She pulled her hood back up and gave the elk a nudge, and their trek resumed. Before they had gone twenty yards, though, she turned to glance behind them and said, "Men, he says. What men? Does he mean wildlings? Why won't he say?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"There's been too much going around," Meera insisted, "and too many secrets. I don't like it. I don't like him. And I don't trust him. Those hands of his are bad enough. He hides his face, and will not speak a name. Who is he? What is he? Anyone can put on a black cloak. Anyone, or any thing. He does not eat, he never drinks, he does not seem to feel the cold."</div>

<div class="line_en">"The scarf." Bran glanced about uneasily, but there was not a raven to be seen. All the big black birds had left them when the ranger did. No one was listening.

Beyond the Wall the monsters live, the giants and the ghouls, the stalking shadows and the dead that walk, she would say, tucking him in beneath his scratchy woolen blanket, but they cannot pass so long as the Wall stands strong and the men of the Night's Watch are true. So go to sleep, my little Brandon, my baby boy, and dream sweet dreams. There are no monsters here. The ranger wore the black of the Night's Watch, but what if he was not a man at all?

<div class="line_en">The water was frozen, and the snow had been falling for so long that Bran had lost count of the days, turning the lake into a vast white wilderness. Where the ice was flat and the ground was bumpy, the going was easy, but where the wind had pushed the snow up into ridges, sometimes it was hard to tell where the lake ended and the shore began. Even the trees were not as infallible a guide as they might have hoped, for there were wooded islands in the lake, and wide areas ashore where no trees grew.</div>

<div class="line_en">The elk went where he would, regardless of the wishes of Meera and Jojen on his back. Mostly he stayed beneath the trees, but where the shore curved away westward he would take the more direct path across the frozen lake, shouldering through snowdrifts taller than Bran as the ice crackled underneath his hooves. Out there the wind was stronger, a cold north wind that howled across the lake, knifed through their layers of wool and leather, and set them all to shivering. When it blew into their faces, it would drive the snow into their eyes and leave them as good as blind.</div>

Over roots and rocks the direwolf sped, through a drift of old snow, the crust crackling beneath his weight. His paws grew wet and cold. The next hill was covered with pines, and the sharp scent of their needles filled the air. When he reached the top, he turned in a circle, sniffing at the air, then raised his head and howled.</div>

<div class="line_en">That proved a forlorn hope. Inside the longhall they found the ashes of a fire, floors of hard-packed dirt, a chill that went bone deep. But at least they had a roof above their heads and log walls to keep the wind off. A stream ran nearby, covered with a film of ice. The elk had to crack it with his hoof to drink.

<div class="line_cn" title="落雪和大快朵颐的狼群慢慢淡去，暖风拂过他的脸颊，犹如母亲的吻。火，他心想，烟。一抽一动的鼻子闻到了烤肉的香味。接着森林不见了，他又回到长厅里，回到残破的身躯中，盯着火堆。梅拉·黎德正在火堆上翻一动一大块血红的生肉，烤焦的肉滴下油脂。“醒得正是时候，”她说。布兰用手背一揉一揉一眼睛，向后扭一动身一子靠墙坐起来。“你几乎睡过晚餐了呢。游骑兵找到一只猪。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Behind her, Hodor was tearing eagerly at a chunk of hot charred flesh as blood and grease ran down into his beard. Wisps of smoke rose from between his fingers. "Hodor," he muttered between bites, "hodor, hodor." His sword lay on the earthen floor beside him. Jojen Reed nipped at his own joint with small bites, chewing each chunk of meat a dozen times before swallowing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿多在她身后急切地撕咬着一大块热腾腾、烤得焦黑的肉，血和油脂滴进他的一胡一子里，他指缝间的肉还冒着丝丝清烟。“阿多，”他边咬边满意地说，“阿多，阿多。”他把剑放在身边的泥地上。玖健·黎德小口咬着一块肘子，每口都要嚼上十来下才吞下去。">查看中文翻译</div>

"Once the heart has ceased to beat, a man's blood runs down into his extremities, where it thickens and congeals." His voice rattled in his throat, as thin and gaunt as he was. "His hands and feet swell up and turn as black as pudding. The rest of him becomes as white as milk."</div>

The monsters cannot pass so long as the Wall stands and the men of the Night's Watch stay true, that's what Old Nan used to say. He came to meet us at the Wall, but he could not pass. He sent Sam instead, with that wildling girl."</div>
