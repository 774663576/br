<div class="line_en">On the morning appointed for her departure Tess was awake before dawn at the marginal minute of the dark when the grove is still mute, save for one prophetic bird who sings with a clear voiced conviction that he at least knows the correct time of day, the rest preserving silence as if equally convinced that he is mistaken. She remained upstairs packing till breakfast-time, and then came down in her ordinary weekday clothes, her Sunday apparel being carefully folded in her box.</div>

<div class="line_en">'Very well; I suppose you know best,' replied Tess with calm abandonment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好啦，好啦；我想你知道得最清楚，”苔丝不再反对了，冷淡地回答说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her mother expostulated. 'You will never set out to see your folks without dressing up more the dandy than that?'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的母亲劝她说：“你出门去走亲戚，从来都不会比你身上那套衣服穿得漂亮些吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'Well, yes,' said Mrs Durbeyfield, and in a private tone, 'at first there mid be a little pretence o't… But I think it will be wiser of lee to put your best side outward,' she added.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不错，是去工作，”德北菲尔德太太说；她用说悄悄话的口气补充说，“开头也许要假装点儿去工作……不过我觉得你还是把最好的衣服穿在外面好些。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And to please her parent the girl put herself quite in Joan's hands, saying serenely 'Do what you like with me, mother.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="为了让母亲高兴，姑娘只好把自己完全交到琼的手里，平静地说——“你爱怎样就怎样吧，妈妈。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mrs Durbeyfield was only too delighted at this tractability. First she fetched a great basin, and washed Tess's hair with such thoroughness that when dried and brushed it looked twice as much as at other times. She tied it with a broader pink ribbon than usual. Then she put upon her the white frock that Tess had worn at the clubwalking, the airy fullness of which, supplementing her enlarged coiffure, imparted to her developing figure an amplitude which belied her age, and might cause her to be estimated as woman when she was not much more than a child.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看见苔丝这样听话，德北菲尔德太太不由得心中大喜。她先去拿来一个大脸盆，彻底地把苔丝的头发洗了一遍，等到头发干了，梳理好了，看起来头发好像比平时多了一倍。她用一根比通常宽得多的粉红色带子把头发扎起来，然后再给苔丝穿上那件在会社游行时穿的白色袍子。苔丝一头蓬松的头发，配上身上穿的宽大袍子，使她正在发育的身体透露出一种成熟来，让人看不出她的实际年龄，也许会错误地把她当成一个成熟的妇人，而其实她比一个孩子大不了多少。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As the looking-glass was only large enough to reflect a very small portion of Tess's person at one time, Mrs Durbeyfield hung a black cloak outside the casement, and so made a large reflector of the panes, as it is the wont of bedecking cottagers to do. After this she went downstairs to her husband, who was sitting in the lower room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="由于镜子太小，一次只能照出苔丝身体的很小一部分，德北菲尔德太太就在窗玻璃的外面挂上一件黑色的外套，用这种办法把窗玻璃变成了一面大镜子，这也是乡下村民梳妆时常用的办法。然后，她就下楼找她的丈夫去了，那时候她丈夫坐在楼下的房间里。">查看中文翻译</div>

If all goes well, I shall certainly be for making some return to that pa'son at Stagfoot Lane for telling us -- dear, good man!'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我要告诉你，德北菲尔德，”她兴高采烈地说：“他决不会不爱上她的。不过无论你说什么话，都不要对苔丝多说他喜欢苔丝的话，也不要提她得到的这个机会。她是一个脾气古怪的姑娘，说多了也许她就讨厌他了，甚至于她马上就不愿到那儿去了。如果一切顺利，我一定要对鹿脚巷的那个牧师有所报答，感谢他告诉我们那些事——他真是个好人。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">However, as the moment for the girl's setting out drew nigh, when the first excitement of the dressing had passed off, a slight misgiving found place in Joan Durbeyfield's mind. It prompted the matron to say that she would walk a little way -- as far as to the point where the acclivity from the valley began its first steep ascent to the outer world. At the top Tess was going to be met with the spring-cart sent by the Stoke-d'Urbervilles, and her box had already been wheeled ahead towards this summit by a lad with trucks, to be in readiness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，姑娘动身的时刻越来越近了，当初梳妆打扮的兴奋一消失，琼·德北菲尔德太太的心里就出现了一阵担忧。因此这位家庭主妇说，她要送姑娘一程——要把姑娘送到山谷斜坡上的那个地点，那个斜坡是通向外部世界的第一个制高点。苔丝就在坡顶上等候斯托克·德贝维尔家派来的轻便马车，而她的行李已经由一个小伙子运到了坡顶上，做好了准备。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">'Good-bye, my maid,' said Sir John, raising his head from his breast as he suspended his nap, induced by a slight excess this morning in honour of the occasion. 'Well, I hope my young friend will like such a comely sample of his own blood.

<div class="line_cn" title="“你去吧，我的孩子。”约翰爵士抬起头来说，为了庆祝苔丝出门的这个早晨，他又去喝了酒，垂着头在那儿打瞌睡。“好吧，但愿我那位年轻的朋友会喜欢上和他同宗的一位漂亮姑娘。还有，告诉他，苔丝，我们家从前是大户人家，现在完全败落了，我要把我们家的名号卖给他——对，卖给他——也不要大价钱。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So the girls and their mother all walked together, a child on each side of Tess, holding her hand, and looking at her meditatively from time to time, as at one who was about to do great things; her mother just behind with the smallest; the group forming a picture of honest beauty flanked by innocence, and backed by simple souled vanity. They followed the way till they reached the beginning of the ascent, on the crest of which the vehicle from Trantridge was to receive her, this limit having been fixed to save the horse the labour of the last slope. Far away behind the first hills the cliff-like dwellings of Shaston broke the line of the ridge. Nobody was visible in the elevated road which skirted the ascent save the lad whom they had sent on before them, sitting on the handle of the barrow that contained all Tess's worldly possessions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="母女俩就这样上路一起走着，苔丝的两边各有一个孩子牵着她的手，心里似乎想着什么，不时地把苔丝看上一眼，就像在看一个正要去干一番大事业的人一样；她母亲同最小的一个孩子走在后面；这一群人构成了一幅图画，中间走着诚实的美丽，两边伴随着无邪的天真，后面跟随着头脑简单的虚荣。她们就一起这样走着，一直走到山坡的底下，从特兰里奇派来的马车就在坡顶上接她，先前的这种安排，是为了免得马车爬这段坡路。在远方第一层山峦的后面，沙斯顿峭壁一样的房舍打乱了山脊的轮廓。在蜿蜒而上的大路上，除了他们派来接苔丝的小伙子而外，看不见一个人影。小伙子坐在车把上，车里装着苔丝在这世界上所有的物品。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It had come -- appearing suddenly from behind the forehead of the nearest upland, and stopping beside the boy with the barrow. Her mother and the children thereupon decided to go no farther, and bidding them a hasty goodbye Tess bent her steps up the hill.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="马车已经来了——它似乎是突然从最近那片高地后面出现的，就停在推小车的小伙子旁边。因此苔丝的母亲和孩子们决定不再往前走了，苔丝在匆忙中向他们道别以后，就弯腰向山坡上走去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They saw her white shape draw near to the spring-cart, on which her box was already placed. But before she had quite reached it another vehicle shot out from a clump of trees on the summit, came round the bend of the road there, passed the luggage-cart, and halted beside Tess, who looked up as if in great surprise.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们看见苔丝的身影离马车越来越近，她的箱子也已经放到了马车上。但是就在她还没有完全走到马车跟前时，又有一辆马车从山顶上的一片树丛中飞快地驶了出来，它绕过路上的一段弯路，从行李车旁驶过来，停在苔丝的面前，苔丝抬头一看，似乎大吃一惊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'Bide here a bit, and the cart will soon come, no doubt,' said Mrs Durbeyfield. 'Yes, I see it yonder!'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“在这儿等一会儿吧，马车很快就要来了，这是用不着怀疑的，”德北菲尔德太太说。“好啦，我已经看见那边的马车啦！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her mother perceived, for the first time, that the second vehicle was not a humble conveyance like the first, but a spick-and-span gig or dogcart, highly varnished and equipped. The driver was a young man of three or four-and-twenty, with a cigar between his teeth; wearing a dandy cap, drab Jacket, breeches of the same hue, white 'neckcloth, stickup collar, and brown driving -- gloves -- in short, he was the handsome, horsey young buck who had visited Joan a week or two before to get her answer about Tess.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的母亲最先看出来，第二辆车和第一辆车不一样，它不是一辆简陋寒酸的马车，而是一辆漂亮整洁的单马双轮马车，又叫狗车，漆光发亮，设备齐全。赶车的是一个二十三四岁的青年男子，嘴里叼着一根雪茄烟，头上戴一顶花哨的小帽，穿一件色彩灰暗的上衣和颜色相同的马裤，围着白色的围巾，戴着硬高领，手上戴着褐色的驾车手套——简而言之，他是一个漂亮的长着一张长脸的年轻人，就在一两个星期前，曾经拜访过琼，向她打听过苔丝的回话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Meanwhile the muslined form of Tess could be seen standing still, undecided, beside this turnout, whose owner was talking to her. Her seeming indecision was, in fact, more than indecision: it was misgiving. She would have preferred the humble cart. The young man dismounted, and appeared to urge her to ascend. She turned her face down the hill to her relatives, and regarded the little group. Something seemed to quicken her to a determination; possibly the thought that she had killed Prince. She suddenly stepped up; he mounted beside her, and immediately whipped on the horse. In a moment they had passed the slow cart with the box, and disappeared behind the shoulder of the hill.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在那个时候，看得见穿细纱布衣服的苔丝形体在马车旁边静静地站着，神情上犹犹豫豫的，马车的主人正在同她说话。事实上，她那种看上去的犹豫远远不是犹豫，而是疑惑。她似乎宁肯坐那辆简陋寒酸的马车。那个年轻人下了车，似乎在劝说她上车。她转过脸去，对着山下她的亲人们，注视着那个小小的群体。似乎有一件事促使她下了决心；很可能，是她想到了王子是在她手里死的。她突然间上了车；他也上车坐在她的旁边，立即向拉车的马抽了一鞭。他们很快就驶过了运送箱子的慢车，消失在山头后面看不见了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Directly Tess was out of sight, and the interest of the matter as a drama was at an end, the little ones' eyes filled with tears. The youngest child said, 'I wish poor, poor Tess wasn't gone away to be a lady!' and, lowering the corners of his lips, burst out crying. The new point of view was infectious, and the next child did likewise, and then the next, till the whole three of them wailed loud.</div>
