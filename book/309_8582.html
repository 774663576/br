<div class="line_en">Several times, through the remainder of January and the entirety of February 1940, when Liesel searched the mailbox for a reply to her letter, it clearly broke her foster father's heart. "I'm sorry," he would tell her. "Not today, huh?" In hindsight, she saw that the whole exercise had been pointless. Had her mother been in a position to do so, she would have already made contact with the foster care people, or directly with the girl, or the Hubermanns. But there had been nothing.</div>

<div class="line_en">To lend insult to injury, in mid-February, Liesel was given a letter from another ironing customer, the Pfaffelhurvers, from Heide Strasse. The pair of them stood with great tallness in the doorway, giving her a melancholic regard. "For your mama," the man said, handing her the envelope. "Tell her we're sorry. Tell her we're sorry."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雪上加霜的是，二月中旬，海德街的老客户普法夫胡弗夫妇递给莉泽尔一封信。这两个大个子站在自家门口，一脸忧伤地看着莉泽尔。“这是给你妈妈的，”男人说着把信封递给她，“告诉她我们很抱歉，告诉她我们很抱歉。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Liesel didn't mind. She didn't whine or moan or stamp her feet. She simply swallowed the disappointment and decided on one calculated risk -- a present from herself. She would gather all of the accrued letters to her mother, stuff them into one envelope, and use just a tiny portion of the washing and ironing money to mail it. Then, of course, she would take the Watschen, most likely in the kitchen, and she would not make a sound.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莉泽尔并不介意。她没有嘀咕，没有抱怨，没有跺脚。她只是把失望咽进了肚子，在一番深思熟虑后决定冒一次险——她要送给自己一份礼物。写给母亲的信越积越多，她要把它们全部塞进一个信封，然后克扣一点洗衣费，把信寄出去。她当然得接受惩罚，很可能会在厨房里挨打，不过她绝不会喊疼。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="罗莎走到她身旁。这可不是个好迹象。她离木勺子已经非常近了。“你干啥了？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Before she could answer, the wooden spoon came down on Liesel Meminger's body like the gait of God. Red marks like footprints, and they burned. From the floor, when it was over, the girl actually looked up and explained.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莉泽尔·梅明格还没来得及回答，一把木勺子就抡了过来，就像上帝踩在她身上一样。红印子大得如同脚印，火辣辣地疼。终于结束的时候，女孩趴在地板上，抬头向妈妈解释。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She broke. "I spent it, Mama."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她撑不住了。“我花掉了，妈妈。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What came to her then was the dustiness of the floor, the feeling that her clothes were more next to her than on her, and the sudden realization that this would all be for nothing -- that her mother would never write back and she would never see her again. The reality of this gave her a second Watschen. It stung her, and it did not stop for many minutes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接下来，她便一头扑在了积满灰尘的地板上，感觉身上的衣服像是被剥离了似的。她突然明白了，她所做的一切都没有用，母亲永远不会回信了，她再也不会见到母亲了。这份领悟相当于第二轮惩罚。它刺痛了她，那种痛好久都没有停歇。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was pulse and yellow light, all together. Her eyes blinked. "I mailed my letters."</div>

<div class="line_en">The red marks grew larger, in patches on her skin, as she lay there, in the dust and the dirt and the dim light. Her breathing calmed, and a stray yellow tear trickled down her face. She could feel herself against the floor. A forearm, a knee. An elbow. A cheek. A calf muscle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莉泽尔趴在地上，趴在尘埃中，趴在昏暗的灯光下，皮肤上的红印子越扩越大，变得一块红一块白。她的呼吸平稳下来，一行黄色的眼泪淌过她的面庞。她能感受到身下的地面，感到自己的前臂、膝盖、手肘、脸颊，还有小腿都紧贴着地。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Above her, Rosa appeared to be smudged, but she soon clarified as her cardboard face loomed closer. Dejected, she stood there in all her plumpness, holding the wooden spoon at her side like a club. She reached down and leaked a little. "I'm sorry, Liesel."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在她上方，罗莎的面容影影绰绰，不过很快就清晰起来，因为她那纸板箱一样的脸越靠越近。胖乎乎的她显得有些垂头丧气，手里像提着一根棍子一样提着那把木勺子。她蹲下来，小声挤出几个字：“对不起，莉泽尔。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When she wrote about that night, she held no animosity toward Rosa Hubermann at all, or toward her mother for that matter. To her, they were only victims of circumstance. The only thought that continually recurred was the yellow tear. Had it been dark, she realized, that tear would have been black.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="写到那个夜晚时，她觉得自己既不恨罗莎·胡伯曼，也不恨母亲。对她来说，她们都只是当时那个环境的受害者。只有那行黄色的眼泪，反复在她的思绪中闪现。她觉得，如果四下里是黑暗的，那行眼泪就会变成黑色的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">No matter how many times she tried to imagine that scene with the yellow light that she knew had been there, she had to struggle to visualize it. She was beaten in the dark, and she had remained there, on a cold, dark kitchen floor. Even Papa's music was the color of darkness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她清楚地知道当时亮着一盏灯，然而每次回想那一幕，她都要费一番力气才能想象出有光的样子。她仿佛是在黑暗中挨的打，然后在黑暗的厨房里趴在冷冰冰的地上，甚至连爸爸的音乐都染上了黑暗的色彩。">查看中文翻译</div>
