<div class="line_en">During the brief hours of daylight on Saturday, Blomkvist and Berger took a walk past the small-boat harbour along the road to Östergården. He had been living on Hedeby Island for a month, but he had never taken a walk inland; the freezing temperatures and regular snowstorms had deterred him. But Saturday was sunny and pleasant. It was as if Berger had brought with her a hint of spring. The road was lined with snow, ploughed three feet high. As soon as they left the summer-cabin area they were walking in dense fir forest. Blomkvist was surprised by how much higher and more inaccessible Söderberget, the hill across from the cabins, was than it appeared from the village. He thought about how many times Harriet Vanger must have played here as a child, but then he pushed all thoughts of her out of his mind. After about a mile the woods ended at a fence where the Östergården farmland began. They could see a white wooden structure and red farm buildings arranged in a square. They turned to head back the same way.</div>

<div class="line_en">One of Berger's outstanding talents was her ability to instantly get on friendly terms with the most unlikely individuals. Blomkvist had seen her turn on the charm for five-year-old boys, who within ten minutes were fully prepared to abandon their mothers. Men over eighty seemed not to be an exception. After two minutes Berger and Henrik Vanger were ignoring Blomkvist as they chattered on. It was as if they had known each other since childhood -- well, since Erika's childhood, at any rate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无论面对多么不可思议的人物，爱莉卡都能立刻与他们建立友好关系，这是她最了不起的专长之一。布隆维斯特曾见过她对一群五岁小男孩施展魔力，才短短十分钟，他们便准备抛弃自己的母亲。八十多岁的男人似乎也不例外。两分钟过后，爱莉卡与范耶尔已经将布隆维斯特晾在一旁，自顾自地聊开了。他们仿佛从小就认识似的——当然了，是从爱莉卡小时候。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Berger started off quite boldly by scolding Vanger for luring her publisher away into the sticks. The old man replied that as far as he could tell -- from assorted press reports -- she had in fact fired him. And had she not done so, then now might be high time to get rid of excess ballast in the editorial offices. And in that case, Vanger said, a period of rustic life would do young Blomkvist some good.</div>

<div class="line_en">For five minutes they discussed Blomkvist's shortcomings in the most irritating terms. Blomkvist leaned back and pretended to be insulted, but he frowned when Berger made some cryptic remarks that might allude to his failings as a journalist but might also have applied to sexual prowess. Vanger tilted his head back and roared with laughter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们俩花了五分钟，用最不堪的字眼讨论布隆维斯特的缺点，后者往后一靠，假装受辱生气。可是当爱莉卡说了一句双关语，可能暗示他当记者失败也可能隐讽他的性能力时，他不由得皱起眉头，范耶尔则是仰头大笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Blomkvist was astonished. He had never seen Vanger so natural and relaxed. He could suddenly see that Vanger, fifty years younger -- or even thirty years -- must have been quite a charming, attractive ladies' man. He had never remarried. There must have been women who crossed his path, yet for nearly half a century he had remained a bachelor.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Mikael has told me that you're having problems at the magazine." Berger glanced at Blomkvist.

On those occasions when he and the old man had touched on the future of Millennium, it had always concerned annoying remarks or the magazine's situation in relation to Blomkvist's ability to finish his work in Hedestad. But Vanger was now addressing Erika alone, one boss to another. Signals passed between them that Blomkvist could not interpret, which might have had to do with the fact that he was basically a poor working-class boy from Norrland and she was an upper-class girl with a distinguished, international family tree.</div>

In return, Vanger would have a conspicuous position on the magazine's board. The agreement would be valid for four years, but it could be terminated by Millennium after two years.

<div class="line_en">Harriet Vanger had been a Christian, in a child's sense of the word -- attending Sunday school, saying evening prayers, and becoming confirmed. In her last year she seemed to have become yet more religious. She read the Bible and went regularly to church. But she had not turned to Hedeby Island's pastor, Otto Falk, who was a friend of the Vanger family. Instead, during the spring she had sought out a Pentecostal congregation in Hedestad. Yet her involvement in the Pentecostal church did not last long. After only two months she left the congregation and instead began reading books about the Catholic faith.</div>

<div class="line_en">The questions about Harriet's private thoughts and feelings remained unanswered. But Blomkvist did make a note of a discrepancy in the report: the information about her uncommunicative frame of mind came chiefly from her classmates, and to a certain extent from the family. Anita Vanger had not thought of her as being introverted at all. He made a note to discuss this matter with Vanger at some point.</div>

<div class="line_en">Some measure of hope was pinned on Anita Vanger, two years older than Harriet and the daughter of Harald. She had spent the summer of 1966 on Hedeby Island and they were thought to be close friends. But Anita had no solid information to offer. They had hung out together that summer, swimming, taking walks, talking about movies, pop bands, and books. Harriet had sometimes gone with Anita when she took driving lessons. Once they had got happily drunk on a bottle of wine they stole from the house. For several weeks the two of them had also stayed at Gottfried's cabin on the very tip of the island.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其中有一丝希望寄托在哈洛德的女儿阿妮塔身上。她比海莉年长两岁，一九六六年在海泽比岛上过暑假，大家都觉得她们俩很要好。可是阿妮塔并无可靠的信息可提供。那年夏天，她们一块进进出出，一块游泳、散步，一块讨论电影、流行乐团与书籍。有时候阿妮塔去学开车，海莉也会跟着去。有一回，她们从家里偷了一瓶酒，尽情地喝了个醉。她们俩也曾在岛上最顶端戈弗里的小屋内待了几个星期。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A more concrete question, to which Morell had devoted much more attention, was a surprising page in Harriet's date book, a beautiful bound book she had been given as a Christmas present the year before she disappeared. The first half of the date book was a day-by-day calendar in which Harriet had listed meetings, the dates of exams at school, her homework, and so on. The date book also had a large section for a diary, but Harriet used the diary only sporadically. She began ambitiously enough in January with many brief entries about people she had met over the Christmas holidays and several about films she had seen. After that she wrote nothing personal until the end of the school year when she apparently -- depending on how the entries were interpreted -- became interested from a distance in some never-named boy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="另外有一个问题比较具体，莫瑞尔投注的精力也多出许多，那就是海莉的记事本中有一页内容颇令人吃惊，这本册子装订得很美，是她失踪前一年收到的圣诞礼物。海莉在前半部逐日记下约会、学校考试、家庭作业等等事件、此外还有大半篇幅可供写日记，但海莉写得很零散。一开始她倒是有心，一月里写了许多短文记录自己在圣诞假期间遇到的人和看过的几部电影。后来便未再写私人的事情，直到学期末她似乎——这端赖于如何解释日记内容——开始暗恋某个始终未提及姓名的男孩。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One possibility was that the telephone numbers were written in some personal code -- so Morell tried to guess how a teenage girl would think. Since the thirty-two series obviously pointed to Hedestad, he set about rearranging the remaining three digits. Neither 32601 or 32160 led to a Magda. As Morell continued his numerology, he realised that if he played around with enough of the numbers, sooner or later he would find some link to Harriet. For example, if he added one to each of the three remaining digits in 32016, he got 32127-- which was the number to Frode's office in Hedestad. But one link like that meant nothing. Besides, he never discovered a code that made sense of all five of the numbers.</div>

There was no Sara in the family, nor did they know of Harriet Vanger, other than that she had been reported in the media as missing.

As she set her rucksack on the ground to put on the bike lock, a dark red Saab began reversing out. She had her back turned but heard the cracking sound from her rucksack. The driver didn't notice a thing and, unwitting, drove off up the exit ramp.</div>

<div class="line_en">Salander turned her face away and tried to get up, but he held her in a tight grip. In terms of physical strength, she was no match for him; she weighed 90 pounds to his 210. He held her head with both hands and turned her face so their eyes met.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莎兰德将头别开，试图起身，但他很用力地压制她。论力气，她比不过他；她四十公斤而他九十五。他用两手抓住她的头，将她的脸转过来，两人视线交汇。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He waited until she lowered her eyes, in what he regarded as submission. Then he pulled her closer. Salander opened her lips and took him in her mouth. He kept his grip on her neck and pulled her fiercely towards him. She felt like gagging the whole ten minutes he took to bump and grind; when finally he came, he was holding her so tight she could hardly breathe.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他等着她低头，并视之为屈服，然后将她拉近。莎兰德张开嘴，将那东西含进口中。他仍紧抓着她的脖子，粗暴地扯着她靠上来。他又撞又压了整整十分钟，她一直觉得作呕，当最后射精时，他抓得她好紧，让她几乎窒息。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He showed her the bathroom in his office. Salander was shaking all over as she wiped her face and tried to rub off the spots on her sweater. She chewed some of his toothpaste to get rid of the taste. When she went back to his office, he was sitting impassively behind his desk, studying some papers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他让她进办公室的洗手间。莎兰德全身发抖，一面擦脸，一面试着洗掉毛线衫上的污渍。她嚼了一点牙膏，想消除口中的味道。回到办公室时，律师正无动于衷地坐在办公桌前研究文件。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I don't think it would be a good idea for you to tell anyone about our games. Think about it -- who would believe you? There are documents stating that you're non compos mentis.
