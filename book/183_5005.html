<div class="line_en">When they reached the jetty at Narrowhaven, Caspian found a considerable crowd assembled to meet them. "This is what I sent word about last night," said Bern. "They are all friends of mine and honest people." And as soon as Caspian stepped ashore the crowd broke out into hurrahs and shouts of, "Narnia! Narnia! Long live the King." At the same moment -- and this was also due to Bern's messengers -- bells began ringing from many parts of the town. Then Caspian caused his banner to be advanced and his trumpet to be blown and every man drew his sword and set his face into a joyful sternness, and they marched up the street so that the street shook, and their armour shone (for it was a sunny morning) so that one could hardly look at it steadily.</div>

<div class="line_en">Nert morning the Lord Bern called his guests early, and after breakfast he asked Caspian to order every man he had into full armour. "And above all," he added, "let everything be as trim and scoured as if it were the morning of the first battle in a great war between noble kings with all the world looking on." This was done; and then in three boatloads Caspian and his people, and Bern with a few of his, put out for Narrowhaven. The king's flag flew in the stern of his boat and his trumpeter was with him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天早上伯恩爵爷一早就来拜客。早餐后他要求凯斯宾下令所有的手下都披胃挂甲。“最重要的是，”他加上一句说，“把一切都弄得整整齐齐，擦得干干净净，仿佛今天早上是尊贵的国王之间当着天下人的面进行大战的头一场战役似的。”这事办好后，凯斯宾和他的手下，伯恩和他几个手下就分成三船，向狭港进发。国王的旗帜在船尾飘扬，他还随身带了号手。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At the castle gate Caspian's trumpeter blew a blast and cried, "Open for the King of Narnia, come to visit his trusty and wellbeloved servant the governor of the Lone Islands." In those days everything in the islands was done in a slovenly, slouching manner. Only the little postern opened, and out came a tousled fellow with a dirty old hat on his head instead of a helmet, and a rusty old pike in his hand. He blinked at the flashing figures before him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯斯宾的号手在城堡大门口吹响号角，大声叫道：“为纳尼亚国王打开城门吧，国王来看望他忠诚可靠而受人尊敬的臣仆，孤独岛总督了。”那年月岛上一切事物都是邋邋遢遢，懒懒散散，城门只打开小暗门，出来一个蓬头乱发，没戴头盔，只戴顶肮脏的旧帽子的家伙，手里还拿着一根生锈的旧长矛。他对着面前这些浑身金光闪闪的人直眨眼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At first the only people who cheered were those who had been warned by Bern's messenger and knew what was happening and wanted it to happen. But then all the children joined in because they liked a procession and had seen very few. And then all the schoolboys joined in because they also liked processions and felt that the more noise and disturbance there was the less likely they would be to have any school that morning. And then all the old women put their heads out of doors and windows and began chattering and cheering because it was a king, and what is a governor compared with that? And all the young women joined in for the same reason and also because Caspian and Drinian and the rest were so handsome. And then all the young men came to see what the young women were looking at, so that by the time Caspian reached the castle gates, nearly the whole town was shouting; and where Gumpas sat in the castle, muddling and messing about with accounts and forms and rules and regulations, he heard the noise.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="开头欢呼的只是伯恩的信使预先告知的人，他们都知道眼前情况，也巴不得有这么一天。可后来所有的儿童都加入了队伍，因为他们喜欢在街上走正步，这种场面又很少见过。再后来所有的学生也加入了，因为他们也喜欢，而且觉得那天早上外面越闹越乱，学校里越不见得会上课。再后来，老大娘都从门窗口探出头来，开始唠唠叨叨，高声欢呼了，因为这究竟是国王呢，总督哪儿比得上啊？接着所有的年轻妇女出于同样原因，也来凑热闹了，再一个原因是凯斯宾和德里宁及其他人都非常英俊。到后来所有的年轻男人也都来看看年轻妇女到底在看些什么，所以凯斯宾到达城堡大门时，几乎全城的人都在大声欢呼；冈帕斯坐在城堡里，正胡乱摆弄着一串账目、表格和条条杠杠，听到了闹声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Two of Caspian's men stepped through the postern and after some struggling with bars and bolts (for everything was rusty) flung both wings of the gate wide open. Then the King and his followers strode into the courtyard. Here a number of the governor's guards were lounging about and several more (they were mostly wiping their mouths) came tumbling out of various doorways. Though their armour was in a disgraceful condition, these were fellows who might have fought if they had been led or had known what was happening; so this was the dangerous moment. Caspian gave them no time to think.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯斯宾手下两个人跨过暗门，因为样样东西都生锈了，花了好一番手脚对付门闩才把两扇大门打开。于是国王和随从就大踏步走进院内。总督有不少警卫在院内闲逛，还有一些人跌跌冲冲从各个门口出来，大多数人还一边擦着嘴。虽然他们的盔甲丢人现眼，假如有人带领他们，或者知道眼前情况，倒兴许会打一仗，所以这是个危险时刻。凯斯宾不让他们有工夫多想。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It is our wish," said Caspian, "that our royal visitation to our realm of the Lone Islands should, if possible, be an occasion of joy and not of terror to our loyal subjects. If it were not for that, I should have something to say about the state of your men's armour and weapons. As it is, you are pardoned. Command a cask of wine to be opened that, your men may drink our health. But at noon tomorrow I wish to see them here in this courtyard looking like men-at-arms and not like vagabonds. See to it on pain of our extreme displeasure."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们希望，”凯斯宾说，“这次御驾亲临我们孤独岛国土，如有可能，应当成为万民欢庆的节日，不是百姓恐怖的场合。如果不是这个缘故，我对你们兵士盔甲和武器的状况就得批评几句了。但实际上，我赦免你们了。来一桶酒，打开桶让弟兄们为我们祝酒。不过到明天中午，我希望在院内看到他们像战士，而不像流浪汉。违令者一律以触犯王上论罪。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The captain gaped but Bern immediately cried, "Three. cheers for the King," and the soldiers, who had understood about the cask of wine even if they understood nothing else, joined in. Caspian then ordered most of his own men to remain in the courtyard. He, with Bern and Drinian and four others, went into the hall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="队长张口结舌，可是伯恩立刻喊道：“三呼国王万岁。”那些兵士虽然别的什么都闹不明白，对酒桶是明白的，就一起欢呼了。于是凯斯宾命令手下大部分都留在院子里。他，带着伯恩、德里宁和其他四个走进大厅。">查看中文翻译</div>

Gumpas was a bilious-looking man with hair that had once been red and was now mostly grey.

<div class="line_en">Caspian nodded to Bern and then stood aside. Bern and Drinian took a step forward and each seized one end of the table. They lifted it, and flung it on one side of the hall where it rolled over, scattering a cascade of letters, dossiers, ink-pots, pens, sealing-wax and documents. Then, not roughly but as firmly as if their hands were pincers of steel, they plucked Gumpas out of his chair and deposited him, facing it, about four feet away. Caspian at once sat down in the chair and laid his naked sword across his knees.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯斯宾对伯恩点点头就站到一边。伯恩和德里宁上前一步，各自抓住桌子一头。他们抬起桌子一扔，桌子就滚到大厅一边了，把信件、档案、墨水缸、笔、封口蜡和公文撒得一地。于是，他们伸出手去，虽然动作不粗野，却牢如钢钳，一把将冈帕斯从椅子里揪出来，把他揪到椅子前四英尺开外的地方。凯斯宾马上在椅子里坐下，把出鞘的剑横搁在双膝上。">查看中文翻译</div>

Firstly I find no record that the tribute due from these Islands to the crown of Narnia has been received for about a hundred and fifty years."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们前来调查阁下的职责行为，”凯斯宾继续说，“有两点我特别要求作出解释。首先，我在档案中查出纳尼亚国王已有一百五十年没收到这些岛屿的进贡了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"That would be a question to raise at the Council next month," said Gumpas. "If anyone moves that a commission of enquiry be set up to report on the financial history of the islands at the first meeting next year, why then…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这个问题得在下个月提交议事会讨论，”冈帕斯说，“如果有谁提议成立一个调查委员会，在明年第一次会议上做本岛财政历史的报告，说明为什么当时……”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I also find it very clearly written in our laws," Caspian went on, "that if the tribute is not delivered the whole debt has to be paid by the Governor of the Lone Islands out of his private purse."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我还在本国法律上看到里面写得清清楚楚，”凯斯宾接着说，“如果贡品没有及时送到，全部积欠得由孤独岛总督的私人腰包中支付。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At this Gumpas began to pay real attention. "Oh, that's quite out of the question," he said. "It is an economic impossibility -- er -- your Majesty must be joking."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="冈帕斯听了这话才真正留起神来。“啊，那可万万办不到，”他说，“经济上负担不起——呃——陛下定在开玩笑吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Inside, he was wondering if there were any way of getting rid of these unwelcome visitors. Had he known that Caspian had only one ship and one ship's company with him, he would have spoken soft words for the moment, and hoped to have them all surrounded and killed during the night. But he had seen a ship of war sail down the straits yesterday and seen it signalling, as he supposed, to its consorts. He had not then known it was the King's ship for there was not wind enough to spread the flag out and make the golden lion visible, so he had waited further developments. Now he imagined that Caspian had a whole fleet at Bernstead. It would never have occurred to Gumpas that anyone would walk into Narrowhaven to take the islands with less than fifty men; it was certainly not at all the kind of thing he could imagine doing himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其实他心里倒在盘算，不知有什么法子摆脱这些不受欢迎的来客。假如他知道凯斯宾只有一条船，只带了一船人，他早就嘴上暂时先说些软话，暗地里一心想趁夜里把他们全部包围杀光了。不过昨天他看见一条战船顺着海峡开来，还看见船上打信号，他猜想是打给跟从的船的。当时他不知道这就是国王的船，因为风力不够大，旗帜飘不起来，上面的金狮像看不出，所以他就等待事情进一步发展。此刻他想象凯斯宾在伯恩斯丹有整整一支舰队。冈帕斯万万没料到居然有人带了不足五十个人就拿下了这些岛屿；当然这种事根本也不是他能想象自己动手干的。">查看中文翻译</div>

And Caspian said, "I think we have had enough of governors," and made Bern a Duke, the Duke of the Lone Islands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那很好，”凯斯宾答，“我们就免你的职。伯恩爵爷，来。”冈帕斯还闹不清是怎么回事，伯恩已经跪下，双手放在国王双手间，宣誓要根据纳尼亚古时的风俗习惯、权利和法律来统治孤独岛。凯斯宾说：“我看，我们无法容忍总督了。”于是当场封伯恩为公爵，孤独岛公爵。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When all this had been pleasantly settled, Caspian ordered horses, of which there were a few in the castle, though very ill-groomed and he, with Bern and Drinian and a few others, rode out into the town and made for the slave market.

<div class="line_en">"We're here, we're here, Caspian," cried Lucy and Edmund together and, "At your service, Sire," piped Reepicheep from another corner. They had all been sold but the men who had bought them were staying to bid for other slaves and so they had not yet been taken away. The crowd parted to let the three of them out and there was great handclasping and greeting between them and Caspian.</div>

<div class="line_en">"On your knees, every man of you, to the King of Narnia," said the Duke.

<div class="line_en">Two merchants of Calormen at once approached. The Calormen have dark faces and long beards. They wear flowing robes and orange-coloured turbans, and they are a wise, wealthy, courteous, cruel and ancient people. They bowed most politely to Caspian and paid him long compliments, all about the fountains of prosperity irrigating the gardens of prudence and virtue -- and things like that -- but of course what they wanted was the money they had paid.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两个卡乐门商人立刻上前。卡乐门人长着黑脸膛，留着长胡子。他们穿着飘拂的长袍，扎着橙红色头巾，他们是聪明、富裕、谦恭而残忍的古老民族。他们极其恭敬地向凯斯宾鞠躬，对他说了长长一篇恭维话，说的全是什么繁荣昌盛的源泉灌溉贤明和德行的花园——还有类似的话——不过他们的目的当然是想收回付出的那笔钱。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Thus Eustace was produced, and sulky he certainly looked; for though no one would want to be sold as a slave, it is perhaps even more galling to be a sort of utility slave whom no one will buy. He walked up to Caspian and said, "I see. As usual. Been enjoying yourself somewhere while the rest of us were prisoners. I suppose you haven't even found out about the British Consul. Of course not."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尤斯塔斯就这样亮了相，果然哭丧着脸；因为虽然没人愿意给人当奴隶卖掉，不过给当成没人愿意买的粗使奴隶，也许更令人恼怒。他走近凯斯宾说，“原来如此。老一套了。我们其他人当俘虏，你自己倒在什么地方逍遥自在。我看，你没打听到英国领事馆吧。当然没有。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That night they had a great feast in the castle of Narrowhaven and then, "Tomorrow for the beginning of our real adventures!" said Reepicheep when he had made his bows to everyone and went to bed. But it could not really be tomorrow or anything like it. For now they were preparing to leave all known lands and seas behind them and the fullest preparations had to be made. The Dawn Treader was emptied and drawn on land by eight horses over rollers and every bit of her was gone over by the most skilled shipwrights. Then she was launched again and victualled and watered as full as she could hold -- that is to say for twenty-eight days. Even this, as Edmund noticed with disappointment, only gave them a fortnight's eastward sailing before they had to abandon their quest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天晚上，他们在狭港城堡里举行盛大宴会，宴会结束后，雷佩契普向大家鞠躬行礼，说道：“明天就要开始我们真正的冒险生活了！”说完就去睡觉了。可是明天根本走不成，谈都谈不上。因为他们现在正准备离开已经探明的陆地和海面，一定得做好充分准备。黎明踏浪者号出空了，搁在滚轴上，由八匹马拖上陆地，每个细小的部分都由最熟练的修船工检修。然后再下水，尽量贮足粮食和饮用水——就是说要准备用上二十八天。爱德蒙注意到尽管这样备足一切，他们也只有十四天时间可用于向东航行，此后就不得不放弃搜寻计划了，不禁大为扫兴。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"And that, I reckon, is where your Majesty's friends went to the bottom." The rest had only wild stories of islands inhabited by headless men, floating islands, waterspouts, and a fire that burned along the water. Only one, to Reepicheep's delight, said, "And beyond that, Aslan country. But that's beyond the end of the world and you can't get there." But when they questioned -- him he could only say that he'd heard it from his father.</div>

<div class="line_en">While all this was being done Caspian missed no chance of questioning all the oldest sea captains whom he could find in Narrowhaven to learn if they had any knowledge or even any rumours of land further to the east. He poured out many a flagon of the castle ale to weather-beaten men with short grey beards and clear blue eyes, and many a tall yarn he heard in return. But those who seemed the most truthful could tell of no lands beyond the Lone Islands, and many thought that if you sailed too far east you would come into the surges of a sea without lands that swirled perpetually round the rim of the world --</div>

<div class="line_en">Bern could only tell them that he had seen his six companions sail away eastward and that nothing had, ever been heard of them again. He said this when he and Caspian were standing on the highest point of Avra looking down on the eastern ocean. "I've often been up here of a morning," said the Duke, "ands seen the sun come up out of the sea, and sometimes it looked as if it were only a couple of miles away. And I've wondered about my friends and wondered what there really is behind that horizon. Nothing, most likely, yet I am always half ashamed that I stayed behind. But I wish your Majesty wouldn't go. We may need your help here. This closing the slave market might make a new world; war with Calormen is what I foresee. My liege, think again."</div>
