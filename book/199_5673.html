It's all right for some… We've been here all night… You'd better get out of the way, we've got a big party coming in from the Black Forest at five fifteen. Hang on, I'll find your campsite… Weasley… Weasley…" He consulted his parchment list. "About a quarter of a mile's walk over there, first field you come to. Site manager's called Mr. Roberts. Diggory… second field… ask for Mr. Payne."</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry disentangled himself from Ron and got to his feet. They had arrived on what appeared to be a deserted stretch of misty moor.

Both were dressed as Muggles, though very inexpertly:</div>

<div class="line_en">They set off across the deserted moor, unable to make out much through the mist. After about twenty minutes, a small stone cottage next to a gate swam into view. Beyond it, Harry could just make out the ghostly shapes of hundreds and hundreds of tents, rising up the gentle slope of a large field toward a dark wood on the horizon. They said good-bye to the Diggorys and approached the cottage door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大家穿过荒无人烟的沼泽地，在浓雾中几乎什么也看不见。走了大约二十分钟，渐渐地眼前出现了一扇门，然后是一座小石屋。哈利勉强可以分辨出石屋后面成千上百个奇形怪状的帐篷，它们顺着大片场地的缓坡往上，那片场地一直伸向地平线上一片黑乎乎的树林。他们告别了迪戈里父子，朝石屋的门走去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The wizard in plus-fours accompanied them toward the gate to the campsite. He looked exhausted: His chin was blue with stubble and there were deep purple shadows under his eyes.

<div class="line_en">"I thought Mr. Bagman was Head of Magical Games and Sports," said Ginny, looking surprised. "He should know better than to talk about Bludgers near Muggles, shouldn't he?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"He should," said Mr. Weasley, smiling, and leading them through the gates into the campsite, "but Ludo's always been a bit… well… lax about security. You couldn't wish for a more enthusiastic head of the sports department though. He played Quidditch for England himself, you know. And he was the best Beater the Wimbourne Wasps ever had."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，”韦斯莱先生笑着说，领着他们穿过大门，走进营地，“卢多一向对安全的问题…嗯…有些马虎。但是，你找不出一个比他更富有激情的人来担任体育司的领导了。你知道，他原来代表英国打过魁地奇球。他是温布恩黄蜂队有史以来最优秀的击球手。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They trudged up the misty field between long rows of tents. Most looked almost ordinary; their owners had clearly tried to make them as Muggle-like as possible, but had slipped up by adding chimneys, or bellpulls, or weather vanes. However, here and there was a tent so obviously magical that Harry could hardly be surprised that Mr. Roberts was getting suspicious. Halfway up the field stood an extravagant confection of striped silk like a miniature palace, with several live peacocks tethered at the entrance. A little farther on they passed a tent that had three floors and several turrets; and a short way beyond that was a tent that had a front garden attached, complete with birdbath, sundial, and fountain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们费力地走在薄雾的营地上，从两排长长的帐篷间穿过。大多数帐篷看上去没什么特殊，显然，它们的主人费了心思，尽可能把它们弄得和麻瓜的帐篷一样，可是有的一不小心做过了头，画蛇添足地加上了烟囱、拉铃绳或风向标，弄得不伦不类。不过，偶尔也有那么几个帐篷，一看就知道是施了魔法的，哈利心想，怪不得罗伯茨先生会产生怀疑呢。在营地中央，有一个帐篷特别显眼。它十分铺张地用了大量的条纹绸，简直像个小小的宫殿，入口处还拴着几只活孔雀。再前面一点，他们又看见一个帐篷搭成四层高楼的形状，旁边还有几个角楼。再往那边，还有一个帐篷的门前还有一个花园，里面鸟澡盆、日晷仪、喷泉等样样俱全。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Couldn't have a better spot!" said Mr. Weasley happily. "The field is just on the other side of the wood there, we're as close as we could be." He hoisted his backpack from his shoulders. "Right," he said excitedly, "no magic allowed, strictly speaking, not when we're out in these numbers on Muggle land. We'll be putting these tents up by hand! Shouldn't be too difficult… Muggles do it all the time… Here, Harry, where do you reckon we should start?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这地方再好也不过了！”韦斯莱先生高兴地说道，“场地就在森林的那一边，近得没法再近了。”他把背包从肩头褪下来。“好啦，”他兴奋地说，“严格地说，不许使用魔法，既然我们这么多人来到了麻瓜的地盘上。我们要用自己的手把帐篷搭起来！应该不会太难…麻瓜们都是这样的…对了，哈利，你认为我们应该从哪儿开始呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>

Nobody looking at these tents would guess they belonged to wizards, Harry thought, but the trouble was that once Bill, Charlie, and Percy arrived, they would be a party of ten.

Some, with furtive looks around them, conjured fires with their wands; others were striking matches with dubious looks on their faces, as though sure this couldn't work. Three African wizards sat in serious conversation, all of them wearing long white robes and roasting what looked like a rabbit on a bright purple fire, while a group of middle-aged American witches sat gossiping happily beneath a spangled banner stretched between their tents that read: THE SALEM WITCHES' INSTITUTE.

Barty Crouch was a stiff, upright, elderly man, dressed in an impeccably crisp suit and tie. The parting in his short gray hair was almost unnaturally straight, and his narrow toothbrush mustache looked as though he trimmed it using a slide rule. His shoes were very highly polished. Harry could see at once why Percy idolized him. Percy was a great believer in rigidly following rules, and Mr. Crouch had complied with the rule about Muggle dressing so thoroughly that he could have passed for a bank manager; Harry doubted even Uncle Vernon would have spotted him for what he really was.</div>
