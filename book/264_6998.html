<div class="line_en">The Bishop of Hereford was very angry with Robin Hood for the trick he had played him at Allan-a-Dale's wedding. He was so angry that he would have been pleased if anyone had caught or killed Robin. But no one did. The wicked people were nearly all afraid of Robin and his brave men. The people who were kind and good loved him.</div>

<div class="line_en">One day the Bishop had to take a great deal of money to a monastery. A monastery is a large house in which a number of good men live together. In those days, however, the men who lived in the monasteries were not always good. Sometimes they were very wicked indeed.</div>

<div class="line_en">To reach the monastery the Bishop had to pass through part of Sherwood Forest. He felt sure he would meet Robin Hood, so he gathered together all his servants, and as many soldiers as he could. He hoped either to kill Robin or to take him prisoner, and bring him to Nottingham to have him hanged there.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a bright, sunny day in the middle of June when the Bishop set out. It was cool and shady under the great trees of the forest. Wild roses and pink and white morning glory trailed across the path. The banks and ditches were gay with bright yellow flowers. Sweet smells filled the air. Birds sang in the branches, and all the world was full of beauty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="主教出发的时候，是六月中间的一个阳光明媚的日子。在森林的大树下凉爽而又有荫凉。野玫瑰、粉红色和白色的牵牛花垂到小道上。河岸和水沟生机勃勃，开满了鲜艳的黄花。空气中弥漫着香气，鸟儿在枝头歌唱，整个世界充满了美色。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Robin loved to walk around in the forest, and he would often leave his men and wander off by himself. This morning everything was so bright and beautiful that he went on and on, hearing nothing but the song of birds, seeing nothing but the trees and flowers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗宾喜欢在森林中散步，他经常离开他的手下，独自一人漫步。这天早上，一切都是那么明亮而美好，他一个劲儿地往前走，只听见鸟儿的歌声，看见的只有树木和花草。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Closer and closer grew the trees; narrower and narrower the paths. Horses fell over roots or fallen branches, sending their riders falling on the ground.

<div class="line_en">As they rode along the Bishop laughed and sang for joy. He was so glad he had taken Robin Hood prisoner. His laughter did not last long, however.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们骑马前行的时候，主教高兴得又是笑，又是唱。他俘虏了罗宾汉，太高兴了。然而，他的笑声持续时间不长。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As they were riding along the forest, the Bishop chanced to see a hundred brave and strong bowmen standing under the Green Wood Tree.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们骑马穿过森林的时候，主教意外地看见100名勇敢而坚强的弓箭手站在绿树下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Blow the trumpet," said the Bishop, turning to the captain of his soldiers. "Call in all our scattered men, for I would be at St. Mary's Abbey by noon."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“吹起喇叭，”主教转身对士兵的队长说。“把我们散落的伙计都召集来，因为到中午我就要到圣玛丽修道院了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Bishop made his horse stop, and laying a hand on the old woman's reins, turned to her with a pale face. "Who are you, then?" he asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="主教勒住了马，一只手拉住在老太太的马缰绳，脸色苍白，转向她。“那你是谁啊？”他问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Who are these," said the Bishop, "and what man is that who leads them?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他们是谁，”主教说，“领头的那个人是谁啊？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Only an old woman, my Lord Bishop. Only an old woman and not Robin Hood at all," she replied.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“只是一个老太太罢了，我的主教大人。只是一个老太太，根本就不是罗宾汉，”她回答道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So the trumpet was blown, and all the Bishop's servants and soldiers gathered together again. Once more they set off, the old woman on her beautiful white horse riding beside the Bishop on his grey horse.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，喇叭吹响了，主教所有的仆人和士兵都重新集合起来。他们再次出发，老太太骑着漂亮的白马走在骑着灰色马的主教身旁。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Bishop's men did not attempt to fight. They saw it was useless. Robin had gathered so many of his brave men that they could easily have killed all the Bishop's men if they had tried. So they laid down their swords and spears and waited quietly to see what would happen next.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="主教的手下并没有试图作战，他们明白那是徒劳的。罗宾集合了那么多勇敢的伙计，如果他们想打的话，他们会轻而易举地把主教的人全部打死。于是，他们放下了剑和长矛，悄悄地等着看下一步会怎么样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then he went to the old woman, untied her hands, and lifted her gently to the ground. "I thank you, madam," he said, "for your kindness to me this day. Robin Hood will never forget it. Now you must have more comfortable clothes. If you follow Much the Miller's son he will take you to Maid Marian. She is waiting for you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后他走到老太太跟前，松开她的手，把她轻轻抱到地上。“我谢谢你，夫人，”他说，“谢谢你今天对我的帮助。罗宾汉永远都不会忘记的。现在，我们再给你一些舒适的衣服。如果你跟着磨坊主的儿子马奇，他会把你带到玛丽安姑娘那里。她正在等着你呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Bishop turned and tried to leave.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="主教转身想逃跑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Thank you kindly," said the old woman, as she went away laughing, "but I think I'll start wearing Lincoln green myself."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“非常感谢，”老太太说着，大笑着走了，“但是我想我也要开始穿林肯绿衣服了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, my Lord Bishop," said Robin, taking his hat off and bowing politely, "no, my lord, you cannot go yet. You owe us something for all the trouble you have given us."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，我的主教大人，”罗宾摘下帽子客气地鞠了一躬，说道，“不，大人，您还不能走。你给我们惹了那么多麻烦，还欠我们的呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then Robin took hold of the Bishop's horse, and tied him fast to a tree. Robin then helped the Bishop to get off his horse, and gave him a comfortable seat on the root of a tree. Then seating himself opposite he said, "Now, my Lord Bishop, how much money have you with you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，罗宾牵过主教的马，把它拴在一棵树上，然后扶主教下马，在树根部给了他一个舒适的座位。然后，他坐在对面，说道：“主教大人，您带了多少钱啊？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Pardon me, it belongs to the poor people from whom you have stolen it," said Robin firmly, "to whom it is now going to be returned. Little John, bring the Bishop's money bags."</div>

<div class="line_en">So in the dim wood, beneath the tall trees, Robin and his men, and the Bishop and his men, friend and enemy, knelt together side by side while the Bishop sang Mass. The birds joined in the singing and the trees whispered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，在昏暗的林中，在高树下，罗宾和他的手下，主教和自己的手下，朋友跟敌人肩并肩跪在一起，听主教唱起《大弥撒》。小鸟一起唱了起来，大树在窃窃低语。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You are right," said Robin, seriously rising and laying his hand on Little John's arm. "The Bishop shall sing Mass before he goes."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你说得对，”罗宾庄重地站起来，把手放在小约翰的胳膊上，说道。“主教临走之前要唱《大弥撒》。”">查看中文翻译</div>
