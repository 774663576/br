<meta content="雨，下了四年十一个月零两天。有时，它仿佛停息了，居民们就象久病初愈那样满脸笑容，穿上整齐的衣服，准备庆祝睛天的来临；但在这样的间隙之后，雨却更猛，大家很快也就习惯了。隆隆的雷声响彻了天空，狂烈的北风向马孔多袭来，掀开了屋顶，刮倒了墙垣，连根拔起了种植园最后剩下的几棵香蕉树。但是，犹如乌苏娜这些日子经常想起的失眠症流行时期那样，灾难本身也能对付苦闷。在跟无所事事进行斗争的人当中，奥雷连诺第二是最顽强的一个。那天晚上，为了一点儿小事，他顺便来到菲兰达家里，正巧碰上了布劳恩先生话说不吉利招来的狂风暴雨。菲兰达在壁橱里找到一把破伞，打算拿给丈夫。“用不着雨伞，”奥雷连诺第二说。“我要在这儿等到雨停。”当然，这句话不能认为是不可违背的誓言，然而奥雷连诺第二打算坚决履行自己的诺言，他的衣服是在佩特娜·柯特家里的，每三天他都脱下身上的衣服。光是穿着短裤，等着把衣服洗干净。他怕闲得无聊，开始修理家中需要修理的许多东西。他配好了门上的铰链，在锁上涂了油，拧紧了门闩的螺钉，矫正了房门的侧柱。在几个月中都可以看见，他腋下挟着一个工具箱（这个工具箱大概是霍·阿·布恩蒂亚在世时吉卜赛人留下的），在房子里忙未忙去，谁也不知道怎么回事——由于体力劳动呢，还是由于极度的忧闷，或者由于不得不节欲——他的肚子逐渐瘪了，象个空扁的皮酒囊；他那大乌龟似的傻里傻气的嘴脸，失去了原来的紫红色；双下巴也消失了；奥雷连诺第二终于瘦得那么厉害，能够自个儿系鞋带了。看见他一鼓作气地修理门闩，拆散挂钟，菲兰达就怀疑丈夫是否也染上了瞎折腾的恶习，象奥雷连诺上校做他的金鱼，象阿玛兰塔缝她的钮扣和殓衣，象霍·阿卡蒂奥第二看他的羊皮纸手稿，象乌苏娜反复唠叨她的往事。但是事情并非如此。原因只是暴雨把一切都搅乱了，甚至不会孕育的机器，如果三天不擦一次油，齿轮之间也会开出花朵；锦缎绣品的丝绒也会生锈；湿衣服也会长出番红花颜色的水草。空气充满了水分，鱼儿可以经过敞开的房门钻进屋子，穿过房间，游出窗子。有一天早晨乌苏娜醒来，感到非常虚弱——临终的预兆——，本来已经要求把她放上担架，抬到安东尼奥·伊萨贝尔神父那儿去，可是圣索菲娅。 德拉佩德立即发现，老太婆的整个背上都布满了水蛭。她就用一根燃烧着的木头烧灼它们，把它们一个一个地除掉，免得它们吸干乌苏娜最后剩下的血。这就不得不挖一条水沟，排出屋里的水，消除屋里的癞蛤模和蜗牛，然后才能弄干地面，搬走床脚下面的砖头，穿着鞋子走动。奥雷连诺第二忙于许多需要他注意的小事，没有察觉自己渐渐老了，可是有一天晚上，他一动动地坐在摇椅里，望着早临的夜色，想着佩特娜。 柯特，虽未感到任何激动，却突然觉得自己老了。看来，没有什么妨碍他回到菲兰达索然寡昧的怀抱（她虽上了年纪，姿容倒更焕发了），可是雨水冲掉了他的一切欲望，使他象个吃得过饱的人那样平平静静。从前，在这种延续整整一年的雨中，他是什么都干得出来的，他一想到此就不禁一笑。在香蕉公司推广锌板屋顶之前很久，他是第一个把锌板带到马孔多的。他把它们弄来，就是为了给佩特娜·柯特盖屋顶，因为听到雨水浇到屋顶的响声，他就觉得跟她亲亲热热特别舒服。然而，即使忆起青年时代那些荒唐怪诞的事儿，奥雷连诺第二也无动于衷，好象他在最后一次放荡时已经发泄完了自己的情欲，现在想起过去的快活就没有苦恼和懊悔了。乍一看来，雨终于使他能够安静地坐“下来，悠闲地左右思量，但是装着注油器和平口钳的箱子却使他过迟地想到了那些有益的事情，那些事情是他能做而未做的。但是情况并不如此。奥雷连诺第二喜欢舒适的家庭生活，既不是由于回忆起往事，也不是由于痛苦的生活经历。他对家庭生活的喜爱是在雨中产生的，是很久以前的童年时代产生的，当时他曾在梅尔加德斯的房间里阅读神话故事，那些故事谈到了飞毯，谈到了吞下整只整只轮船和乘员的鲸鱼。有一天，因为菲兰达的疏忽，小奥雷连诺溜到了氏廊上。奥雷连诺第二立即认出这小孩儿是他的孙子。他给他理发，帮他穿衣服。叫他不要怕人；不久之后，谁也不怀疑这是布恩蒂亚家中合法的孩子了，他具有这家人的共同特点：突出的颧骨，惊异的眼神，孤僻的模样儿。菲兰达从此也就放心了。她早就想克制骄做，可是不知道怎么办才好，因为她越考虑解决办法，就越觉得这些办法不合适。如果她知道奥雷连诺第二会用祖父的宽厚态度对待意外的孙子，她就不会采取各种搪塞和拖延的花招，一年前就会放弃把亲骨肉弄死的打算了。这时，阿玛兰塔·乌苏娜的乳齿已经换成恒齿，侄儿成了她闷倦的下雨时刻用来消遣的活玩具。奥雷连诺第二有一次想起，在梅梅昔日的卧室里，扔着大家忘记了的英国百科全书。他开始让孩子们看图画：起初是动物画，然后是地图、其他国家的风景画以及名人的肖像。奥雷连诺第二不懂英语，勉强能够认出的只是最有名的城市和最著名的人物，囚此他不得不自己想出一些名字和说法，来满足孩子们无限的好奇心。" name="description"/>

<div class="line_en">It Rained for four years, eleven months, and two days. There were periods of drizzle during which everyone put on his full dress a convalescent look to celebrate the clearing, but the people soon grew accustomed to interpret the pauses as a sign of redoubled rain. The sky crumbled into a set of destructive storms and out of the north came hurricanes that scattered roofs about and knocked down walls and uprooted every last plant of the banana groves. Just as during the insomnia plague, as úrsula came to remember during those days, the calamity itself inspired defenses against boredom. Aureliano Segundo was one of those who worked hardest not to be conquered by idleness. He had gone home for some minor matter on the night that Mr. Brown unleashed the storm, and Fernanda tried to help him with a half-blown-out umbrella that she found in a closet. "I don't need it," he said. "I'll stay until it clears." That was not, of course, an ironclad promise, but he would accomplish it literally. Since his clothes were at Petra Cotes's, every three days he would take off what he had on and wait in his shorts until they washed. In order not to become bored, he dedicated himself to the task of repairing the many things that needed fixing in the house. He adjusted hinges, oiled locks, screwed knockers tight, and planed doorjambs. For several months he was seen wandering about with a toolbox that the gypsies must have left behind in José Arcadio Buendía's days, and no one knew whether because of the involuntary exercise, the winter tedium or the imposed abstinence, but his belly was deflating little by little like a wineskin and his face of a beatific tortoise was becoming less bloodshot and his double chin less prominent until he became less pachydermic all over and was able to tie his own shoes again. Watching him putting in latches and repairing clocks, Fernanda wondered whether or not he too might be falling into the vice of building so that he could take apart like Colonel Aureliano Buendía and his little gold fishes, Amaranta and her shroud and her buttons, José Arcadio and the parchments, and úrsula and her memories. But that was not the case. The worst part was that the rain was affecting everything and the driest of machines would have flowers popping out among their gears they were not oiled every three days, and the threads in brocades rusted, and wet clothing would break out in a rash of saffron-colored moss. The air was so damp that fish could have come in through the doors and swum out the windows, floating through the atmosphere in the rooms. One morning úrsula woke up feeling that she was reaching her end in a placid swoon and she had already asked them to take her to Father Antonio Isabel, even if it had to be on a stretcher, when Santa Sofía de la Piedad discovered that her back was paved with leeches. She took them off one by one, crushing them with a firebrand before they bled her to death. It was necessary to dig canals to get the water out of the house and rid it of the frogs and snails so that they could dry the floors and take the bricks from under the bedposts and walk in shoes once more. Occupied with the many small details that called for his attention, Aureliano Segundo did not realize that he was getting old until one afternoon when he found himself contemplating the premature dusk from a rocking chair and thinking about Petra Cotes without quivering. There would have been no problem in going back to Fernanda's insipid love, because her beauty had become solemn with age, but the rain had spared him from all emergencies of passion and had filled him with the spongy serenity of a lack of appetite. He amused himself thinking about the things that he could have done in other times with that rain which had already lasted a year. He had been one of the first to bring zinc sheets to Macondo, much earlier than their popularization by the banana company, simply to roof Petra Cotes's bedroom with them and to take pleasure in the feeling of deep intimacy that the sprinkling of the rain produced at that time. But even those wild memories of his mad youth left him unmoved, just as during his last debauch he had exhausted his quota of salaciousness and all he had left was the marvelous gift of being able to remember it without bitterness or repentance. It might have been thought that the deluge had given him the opportunity to sit and reflect and that the business of the pliers and the oilcan had awakened in him the tardy yearning of so many useful trades that he might have followed in his life and did not; but neither case was true, because the temptation of a sedentary domesticity that was besieging him was not the result of any rediscovery or moral lesion. it came from much farther off, unearthed by the rain's pitchfork from the days when in Melquíades' room he would read the prodigious fables about flying carpets and whales that fed on entire ships and their crews. It was during those days that in a moment of carelessness little Aureliano appeared on the porch and his grandfather recognized the secret of his identity. He cut his hair, dressed him taught him not to be afraid of people, and very soon it was evident that he was a legitimate Aureliano Buendía, with his high cheekbones, his startled look, and his solitary air. It was a relief for Fernanda. For some time she had measured the extent of her pridefulness, but she could not find any way to remedy it because the more she thought of solutions the less rational they seemed to her. If she had known that Aureliano Segundo was going to take things the way he did, with the fine pleasure of a grandfather, she would not have taken so many turns or got so mixed up, but would have freed herself from mortification the year before Amaranta úrsula, who already had her second teeth, thought of her nephew as a scurrying toy who was a consolation for the tedium of the rain. Aureliano Segundo remembered then the English ency-clopedia that no one had since touched in Meme's old room. He began to show the children the pictures, especially those of animals, and later on the maps and photographs remote countries and famous people. Since he did not know any English and could identify only the most famous cities and people, he would invent names and legends to satisfy the children's insatiable curiosity.</div>

<div class="line_en">Fernanda really believed that her husband was waiting for it to clear to return to his concubine. During the first months of the rain she was afraid that he would try to slip into her bedroom that she would have to undergo the shame revealing to him that she was incapable of reconciliation since the birth of Amaranta úrsula. That was the reason for her anxious correspondence with the invisible doctors, interrupted by frequent disasters of the mail. During the first months when it was learned that the trains were jumping their tracks in the rain, a letter from the invisible doctors told her that hers were not arriving. Later on, when contact with the unknown correspondents was broken, she had seriously thought of putting on the tiger mask that her husband had worn in the bloody carnival and having herself examined under a fictitious name by the banana company doctors. But one of the many people who regularly brought unpleasant news of the deluge had told her that the company was dismantling its dispensaries to move them to where it was not raining. Then she gave up hope. She resigned herself to waiting until the rain stopped and the mail service was back to normal, and in the meantime she sought relief from her secret ailments with recourse to her imagination, because she would rather have died than put herself in the hands of the only doctor left in Macondo, the extravagant Frenchman who ate grass like a donkey. She drew close to úrsula, trusting that she would know of some palliative for her attacks. But her twisted habit of not calling things by their names made her put first things last and use "expelled" for "gave birth" and "burning" for "flow" so that it would all be less shameful, with the result that úrsula reached the reasonable conclusion that her trouble was intestinal rather than uterine, and she advised her to take a dose of calomel on an empty stomach. If it had not been for that suffering, which would have had nothing shameful about it for someone who did not suffer as well from shamefulness, and if it had not been for the loss of the letters, the rain would not have bothered Fernanda, because, after all, her whole life had been spent as if it had been raining. She did not change her schedule or modify her ritual. When the table was still raised up on bricks and the chairs put on planks so that those at the table would not get their feet wet, she still served with linen tablecloths and fine chinaware and with lighted candles, because she felt that the calamities should not be used as a pretext for any relaxation in customs. No one went out into the street any more. If it had depended on Fernanda, they would never have done so, not only since it started raining but since long before that, because she felt that doors had been invented to stay closed that curiosity for what was going on in the street was a matter for harlots. Yet she was the first one to look out when they were told that the funeral procession for Colonel Gerineldo Márquez was passing by and even though she only watched it through the half-opened window it left her in such a state of affliction that for a long time she repented in her weakness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲兰达真的相信，天一放晴，她的丈夫准会回到恰妇那儿去。开头，她生怕他试图钻进她自己的卧宝：如果他钻了进来，她就得羞涩地向他解释，在阿玛兰塔·乌苏娜出生以后，她已失去了夫妻生活的能力。这种恐惧也成了菲兰达跟没有见过的医生加紧通信的原因，由于邮务工作遭到阻碍，她和他们的通信是经常中断的。在最初几个月里，暴风雨造成了几次铁道事故，菲兰达从没有见过的医生的信中知道，她的几封信都没送到收信地点。随后，跟陌生医生的联系终于断了，她忧认真考虑是不是戴上她大夫在血腥的狂欢节戴过的老虎面具，化名去找香蕉公司的医生诊治。可是，有一个经常把暴雨中的不幸消息带到她家来的女人告诉她，香蕉公司已把门诊所迁到无雨的地方去了。于是菲兰达只好放弃自己的希望，听天由命，等候雨停和邮务恢复正常，这时她就用土方土药治疗自己的暗疾，因为她宁死也不让自己落到最后留在马孔多的一个医生手里，那医生是个有点古怪的法国人，象马或驴一样用草充饥。她跟乌苏娜亲近起来，希望从老太婆那儿探出什么救命药方。可是菲兰达有一种拐弯抹角的习惯，不愿直呼事物的名称，她把原因换成了结果，说是因为太热，所以出血。这样，她就觉得自己的病不太可羞了。乌苏娜很有道理地诊断说，病不在肚子里，而在胃里，劝她服用甘汞。其他任何一个没有反常差耻心的女人，都不会觉得这种疾病对自己有什么可耻，而菲兰达却不是这样。如果不是这种病症，如果她的信函没有遗失，她眈不会理睬缠绵的雨了，因为她度过的一生终归象是窗外的滂沱大雨。她没改变用餐的时间，也没放弃自己的任何习惯。别人在桌于脚下垫上砖头，将椅子放在厚木板上，免得吃饭时弄湿了脚，菲兰达照旧铺上荷兰桌布，摆上中国餐具，晚餐之前点上枝形烛台的蜡烛，因为她以为自然灾害不能作为破坏常规的借口。家里的任何人都没上街。如果菲兰达能够做到的话，她在大雨开始之前很久就会把所有的房门永远关上，冈为照她看来，房门发明出来就是为了关闭的，而对街上的事感到兴趣的只是那些妓女。但是，听说格林列尔多·马克斯上校的送葬队伍经过房屋前面，第一个扑到窗口去的就是她：但是，通过半开的窗子看见的景象使得菲兰达难过到了那种程度，以至许多个月以后她还在懊悔自己一时的脆弱。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She could not have conceived of a more desolate cortege. They had put the coffin in an oxcart over which they built a canopy of banana leaves, but the pressure of the rain was so intense and the streets so muddy that with every step the wheels got stuck and the covering was on the verge of falling apart. The streams of sad water that fell on the coffin were soaking the flag that had been placed on top which was actually the flag stained with blood and gunpowder that had been rejected by more honorable veterans. On the coffin they had also placed the saber with tassels of silver and copper, the same one that Colonel Gerineldo Márquez used to hang on the coat rack in order to go into Amaranta's sewing room unarmed. Behind the cart, some barefoot and all of them with their pants rolled up, splashing in the mud were the last survivors of the surrender at Neerlandia carrying a drover's staff in one hand and in the other a wreath of paper flowers that had become discolored in the rain. They appeared like an unreal vision along the street which still bore the name of Colonel Aureliano Buendía and they all looked at the house as they passed and turned the corner at the square, where they had to ask for help to move the cart, which was stuck. úrsula had herself carried to the door by Santa Sofía de la Piedad.

<div class="line_en">The condition of the streets alarmed Aureliano Segundo. He finally became worried about the state of his animals and he threw an oilcloth over his head and sent to Petra Cotes's house. He found her in the court-yard, in the water up to her waist, trying to float the corpse of a horse. Aureliano Segundo helped her with a lever, and the enormous swollen body gave a turn like a bell and was dragged away by the torrent of liquid mud. Since the rain began, all that Petra Cotes had done was to clear courtyard of dead animals. During the first weeks she sent messages to Aureliano Segundo for him to take urgent measures and he had answered that there was no rush, that the situation was not alarming, that there would be plenty of time to think about something when it cleared. She sent him word that the horse pastures were being flooded, that the cattle were fleeing to high ground, where there was nothing to eat and where they were at the mercy of jaguars and sickness. "There's nothing to be done," Aureliano Segundo answered her. "Others will be born when it clears." Petra Cates had seen them die in dusters and the was able to butcher only those stuck in the mud. She saw with quiet impotence how the deluge was pitilessly exterminating a fortune that at one time was considered the largest and most solid in Macondo, and of which nothing remained but pestilence. When Aureliano Segundo decided to go see what was going on, he found only the corpse of the horse and a squalid mule in the ruins of the stable. Petra Cotes watched him arrive without surprise, joy, or resentment, and she only allowed herself an ironic smile.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Good morning, Fernanda, did you sleep well?" Nor had they asked her, even out of courtesy, why she was so pale or why she awoke with purple rings under her eyes in spite of the fact that she expected it, of course, from a family that had always considered her a nuisance, an old rag, a booby painted on the wall, and who were always going around saying things against her behind her back, calling her church mouse, calling her Pharisee, calling her crafty, and even Amaranta, may she rest in peace, had said aloud that she was one of those people who could not tell their rectums from their ashes, God have mercy, such words, and she had tolerated everything with resig-nation because of the Holy Father, but she had not been able to tolerate it any more when that evil José Arcadio Segundo said that the damnation of the family had come when it opened its doors to a stuck-up highlander, just imagine, a bossy highlander, Lord save us, a highlander daughter of evil spit of the same stripe as the highlanders the government sent to kill workers, you tell me, and he was referring to no one but her, the godchild of the Duke of Alba, a lady of such lineage that she made the liver of presidents' wives quiver, a noble dame of fine blood like her, who had the right to sign eleven peninsular names and who was the only mortal creature in that town full of bastards who did not feel all confused at the sight of sixteen pieces of silverware, so that her adulterous husband could die of laughter afterward and say that so many knives and forks spoons were not meant for a human being but for a centipede, and the only one who could tell with her eyes closed when the white wine was served and on what side and in which glass and when the red wine and on what side in which glass, and not like that peasant of an Amaranta, may she rest in peace, who thought that white wine was served in the daytime and red wine at night, and the only one on the whole coast who could take pride in the fact that she took care of her bodily needs only in golden chamberpots, so that Colonel Aureliano Buendía, may he rest in peace, could have the effrontery to ask her with his Masonic Ill humor where she had received that privilege whether she did not shit shit but shat sweet basil, just imagine, with those very words, and so that Renata, own daughter, who through an oversight had seen her stool in the bedroom, had answered that even if the pot was all gold and with a coat of arms, what was inside was pure shit, physical shit, and worse even than any other kind because it was stuck-up highland shit, just imagine, her own daughter, so that she never had any illusions about the rest of the family, but in any case she had the right to expect a little more consideration from her husband because, for better or for worse, he was her consecrated spouse her helpmate, her legal despoiler, who took upon himself of his own free and sovereign will the grave responsibility taking her away from her paternal home, where she never wanted for or suffered from anything, where she wove funeral wreaths as a pastime, since godfather had sent a letter his signature and the stamp of his ring on the sealing wax simply to say that the hands of his goddaughter were not meant for tasks of this world except to play the clavichord, and, nevertheless, her insane husband had taken her from her home with all manner of admonitions and warnings and had brought her to that frying pan of hell where a person could not breathe because of the heat, and before she had completed her Pentecostal fast he had gone off with his wandering trunks and his wastrel's accordion to loaf in adultery with a wretch of whom it was only enough to see her behind, well, that's been said, to see her wiggle her mare's behind in order to guess that she was a, that she was a, just the opposite of her, who was a lady in a palace or a pigsty, at the table or in bed, a lady of breeding, God-fearing, obeying His laws and submissive to His wishes, whom he could not perform, naturally, the acrobatics and trampish antics that he did with the other one, who, of course, was ready for anything like the French matrons, and even worse, if one considers well, because they at least had the honesty to put a red light at their door, swinishness like that, just imagine, and that was all that was needed by the only and beloved daughter of Do? a Renata Argote and Don Fernando del Carpio, and especially the latter, an upright man, a fine Christian, a Knight of the Order of the Holy Sepulcher, those who receive direct from God the privilege of remaining intact in their graves with their skin smooth like the cheeks of a bride and their eyes alive and clear like emeralds.</div>

That night at dinner the exasperating buzzing of the singsong had conquered the sound of the rain. Aureliano, Segundo ate very little, with his head down, and he went to his room early. At breakfast on the following day Fernanda was trembling, with a look of not having slept well, and she seemed completely exhausted by her rancor. Nevertheless, when her husband asked if it was not possible to have a soft-boiled egg, she did not answer simply that they had run out of eggs the week before, but she worked up a violent diatribe against men who spent their time contemplating their navels and then had the gall to ask for larks' livers at the table. Aureliano Segundo took the children to look at the encyclopedia, as always, and Fernanda pretended to straighten out Meme's room just so that he could listen to her muttering, of course, that it certainly took cheek for him to tell the poor innocents that there was a picture of Colonel Aureliano Buendía in the encyclopedia. During the afternoon, while the children were having their nap, Aureliano Segundo sat on the porch and Fernanda pursued him even there, provoking him, tormenting him, hovering about him with her implacable horsefly buzzing, saying that, of course, while there was nothing to eat except stones, her husband was sitting there like a sultan of Persia, watching it rain, because that was all he was, a slob, a sponge, a good-for-nothing, softer than cotton batting, used to living off women and convinced that he had married Jonah's wife, who was so content with the story of the whale. Aureliano Segundo listened to her for more than two hours, impassive, as if he were deaf. He did not interrupt her until late in the afternoon, when he could no longer bear the echo of the bass drum that was tormenting his head.</div>

Then Aureliano Segundo lost control. He stood up unhurriedly, as if he only intended to stretch, and with a perfectly regulated and methodical fury he grabbed the pots with the begonias one after the other, those with the ferns, the oregano, and one after the other he smashed them onto the floor. Fernanda was frightened because until then she had really not had a clear indication of the tremendous inner force of her singsong, but it was too late for any attempt at rectification. Intoxicated by the uncontained torrent of relief, Aureliano Segundo broke the glass on the china closet and piece by piece, without hurrying, he took out the chinaware and shattered it on the floor. Systematically, serenely, in the same parsimonious way in which he had papered the house with banknotes, he then set about smashing the Bohemian crystal ware against the walls, the hand-painted vases, the pictures of maidens in flower-laden boats, the mirrors in their gilded frames, everything that was breakable, from parlor to pantry, and he finished with the large earthen jar in the kitchen, which exploded in the middle of the courtyard with a hollow boom. Then he washed his hands, threw the oilcloth over himself, and before midnight he returned with a few strings of dried meat, several bags of rice, corn with weevils, and some emaciated bunches of bananas.

<div class="line_en">Amaranta úrsula little Aureliano would remember the rains as a happy time. In spite of Fernanda's strictness, they would splash in the puddles in the courtyard, catch lizards and dissect them, and pretend that they were poisoning the soup with dust from butterfly wings when Santa Sofía de la Piedad was not looking úrsula was their most amusing plaything. They looked upon her as a big,. broken-down doll that they carried back and forth from one corner to another wrapped in colored cloth and with her face painted with soot and annatto, and once they were on the point of plucking out her eyes with the pruning shears as they had done with the frogs. Nothing gave them as much excitement as the wanderings of her mind. Something, indeed, must have happened to her mind during the third year of the rain, for she was gradually losing her sense of reality and confusing present time with remote periods of her life to the point where, on one occasion, she spent three days weeping deeply over the death of Petronila Iguarán, her great-grandmother, buried for over a century. She sank into such an insane state of confusion that she thought little Aureliano was her son the colonel during the time he was taken to see ice, and that the José Arcadio who was at that time in the seminary was her firstborn who had gone off with the gypsies. She spoke so much about the family that the children learned to make up imaginary visits with beings who had not only been dead for a long time, but who had existed at different times. Sitting on the bed, her hair covered with ashes and her face wrapped in a red kerchief, úrsula was happy in the midst of the unreal relatives whom the children described in all detail, as if they had really known them. úrsula would converse with her forebears about events that took place before her own existence, enjoying the news they gave her, and she would weep with them over deaths that were much more recent than the guests themselves. The children did not take long to notice that in the course of those ghostly visits úrsula would always ask a question destined to establish the one who had brought a life-size plaster Saint Joseph to the house to be kept until the rains stopped. It was in that way that Aureliano Segundo remembered the fortune buried in some place that only úrsula knew, but the questions and astute maneuvering that occurred to him were no use because in the labyrinth of her madness she seemed to preserve enough of a margin of lucidity to keep the secret which she would reveal only to the one who could prove that he was the real owner of the buried gold. She was so skillful and strict that when Aureliano Segundo instructed one of his carousing companions to pass himself off as the owner of the fortune, she got all caught up in a minute interrogation sown with subtle traps.</div>

<div class="line_en">Convinced that úrsula would carry the secret to her grave, Aureliano Segundo hired a crew of diggers under the pretext that they were making some drainage canals in the courtyard and the backyard, and he himself took soundings in the earth with iron bars and all manner of metal-detectors without finding anything that resembled gold in three months of exhaustive exploration. Later on he went to Pilar Ternera with the hope that the cards would we more than the diggers, but she began by explaining that any attempt would be useless unless úrsula cut the cards. On the other hand, she confirmed the existence of the treasure the precision of its consisting of seven thousand two hundred fourteen coins buried in three canvas sacks reinforced with copper wire within a circle with a radius of three hundred eighty -- eight feet with úrsula's bed as the center, but she warned that it would not be found until it stopped raining and the suns of three consecutive Junes had changed the piles of mud into dust. The profusion and meticulous vagueness of the information seemed to Aureliano Segundo so similar to the tales of spiritualists that he kept on with his enterprise in spite of the fact that they were in August and they would have to wait at least three years in order to satisfy the conditions of the prediction. The first thing that startled him, even though it increased his confusion at the same time, was the fact that it was precisely three hundred eighty-eight feet from úrsula's bed to the backyard wall. Fernanda feared that he was as crazy as his twin brother when she saw him taking the measurements, even more when he told the digging crew to make the ditches three feet deeper. Overcome by an exploratory delirium comparable only to that of his great-grandfather when he was searching for the route of inventions, Aureliano Segundo lost the last layers of fat that he had left and the old resemblance to his twin brother was becoming accentuated again, not only because of his slim figure, but also because of the distant air and the withdrawn attitude. He no longer bothered with the children. He ate at odd hours, muddled from head to toe, and he did so in a corner in the kitchen, barely answering the occasional questions asked by Santa Sofía de la Piedad. Seeing him work that way, as she had never dreamed him capable of doing, Fernanda thought that his stubbornness was diligence, his greed abnegation, and his thickheadedness perseverance, and her insides tightened with remorse over the virulence with which she had attacked his idleness. But Aureliano Segundo was in no mood for merciful reconciliations at that time. Sunk up to his neck in a morass of dead brandies and rotting flowers, he flung the dirt of the garden all about after having finished with the courtyard and the backyard, and he excavated so deeply under the foundations of the east wing of the house that one night they woke up in terror at what seemed to be an earthquake, as much because of the trembling as the fearful underground creaking. Three of the rooms were collapsing a frightening crack had opened up from the porch to Fernanda's room. Aureliano Segundo did not give up the search because of that. Even when his last hopes had been extinguished the only thing that seemed to make any sense was what the cards had predicted, he reinforced the jagged foundation, repaired the crack with mortar, and continued on the side to the west. He was still there on the second week of the following June when the rain began to abate and the clouds began to lift and it was obvious from one moment to the next that it was going to clear. That was what happened. On Friday at two in the afternoon the world lighted up with a crazy crimson sun as harsh as brick dust and almost as cool as water, it did not rain again for ten years.</div>

<div class="line_en">Macondo was in ruins. In the swampy streets there were the remains of furniture, animal skeletons covered with red lilies, the last memories of the hordes of newcomers who had fled Macondo as wildly as they had arrived. The houses that had been built with such haste during the banana fever had been abandoned. The banana company tore down its installations. All that remained of the former wiredin city were the ruins. The wooden houses, the cool terraces for breezy card-playing afternoons, seemed to have been blown away in an anticipation of the prophetic wind that years later would wipe Macondo off the face of the earth. The only human trace left by that voracious blast was a glove belonging to Patricia Brown in an automobile smothered in wild pansies. The enchanted region explored by José Arcadio Buendía in the days of the founding, where later on the banana plantations flourished, was a bog of rotting roots, on the horizon of which one could manage to see the silent foam of the sea. Aureliano Segundo went through a crisis of affliction on the first Sunday that he put on dry clothes and went out to renew his acquaintance with the town. The survivors of the catastrophe, the same ones who had been living in Macondo before it had been struck by the banana company hurricane, were sitting in the middle of the street enjoying their first sunshine. They still had the green of the algae on their skin and the musty smell of a corner that had been stamped on them by the rain, but in their hearts they seemed happy to have recovered the town in which they had been born. The Street of the Turks was again what it had been earlier, in the days when the Arabs with slippers and rings in their ears were going about the world swapping knickknacks for macaws and had found in Macondo a good bend in the road where they could find respite from their age -- old lot as wanderers. Having crossed through to the other side of the rain. the merchandise in the booths was falling apart, the cloths spread over the doors were splotched with mold, the counters undermined by termites, the walls eaten away by dampness, but the Arabs of the third generation were sitting in the same place and in the same position as their fathers and grandfathers, taciturn, dauntless, invulnerable to time and disaster, as alive or as dead as they had been after the insomnia plague and Colonel Aureliano Buendía's thirty-two wars. Their strength of spirit in the face of ruins of the gaming tables, the fritter stands, the shooting galleries, and the alley where they interpreted dreams and predicted the future made Aureliano Segundo ask them with his usual informality what mysterious resources they had relied upon so as not to have gone awash in the storm, the devil they had done so as not to drown, and one after the other, from door to door, they returned a crafty smile and a dreamy look, and without any previous consultation they all gave the answer: "Swimming."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="马孔多成了一片废墟。街道上是一个个水潭，污泥里到处都露出破烂的家具和牲畜的骸骨，骸骨上长出了红百合花一一这是一群外国佬最后的纪念品，他们匆忙地来到马孔多，又匆忙地逃离了马孔多。“香蕉热”时期急速建筑起来的房屋已经抛弃了。香蕉公司运走了自己所有的东西。在铁丝网围着的小镇那儿，只留下了一堆堆垃圾，那一座座木房子，从前每天傍晚凉台上都有人无忧无虑地玩纸牌，也象被狂风刮走了，这种狂风是未来十二级飓风的前奏；多年以后，那种飓风注定要把马孔多从地面上一扫而光。在这一次致命的狂风之后，从前这儿住过人的唯一证明。是帕特里西娅。 布劳恩忘在小汽车里的一只手套，小汽车上爬满了三色茧。霍。阿布恩蒂亚建村时期勘探过的“魔区”，嗣后香蕉园曾在这儿繁荣起来，现在却是一片沼泽，到处都隐藏着烂掉的树根，在远处露出的地平线上，这片海洋在好几年中仍然无声地翻着泡沫。第一个礼拜日，奥雷连诺第二穿着干衣服，出门看见这个市镇的样子，感到十分惊愕。雨后活下来的那些人——全是早在香蕉公司侵入之前定居马孔多的人——都坐在街道中间，享受初露的阳光。他们的皮肤仍象水藻那样微微发绿，下雨年间渗进皮肤的储藏室霉味还没消失可是他们脸上却露出愉快的微笑，因为意识到他们土生土长的市镇重新属于他们了。辉煌的土耳其人街又成了昔日的样子，从前，那些浪迹天涯的阿拉伯人，穿着拖鞋，戴着粗大的金属耳环，拿小玩意儿交换鹦鹉，在千年的流浪之后在马孔多获得了可靠的栖身之所。现在，下雨时摆在摊子上的货品已经瓦解，陈列在商店里的货品已经发霉，柜台已被白蚁至坏，墙壁已给潮气侵蚀，可是第三代的阿拉伯人却坐在他们的祖辈坐过的地方，象祖辈一样的姿势，默不吭声，泰然自若，不受时间和自然灾害的支配，死活都象患失眠症以后那样，或者象奥雷连诺上校的三十二次战争以后那样。面对着毁了的赌桌和食品摊，面对着残存的靶场，面对着人们曾在那里圆梦和预卜未来的一片瓦砾的小街小巷，阿拉伯人依然精神饱满，这使奥雷连诺第二觉得惊异，他就用往常那种不拘礼节的口吻询问他们，他们依靠什么神秘的力量才没给洪流冲走，没给大水淹死；他从这家走到那家，一再提出这个问题，到处都遇到同样巧妙的微笑。同样沉思的目光以及同样的回答：“我们会游泳。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Petra Cotes was perhaps the only native who had an Arab heart. She had seen the final destruction of her stables, her barns dragged off by the storm. but she had managed to keep her house standing. During the second year she had sent pressing messages to Aureliano Segundo and he had answered that he did not know when he would go back to her house, but that in any case he would bring along a box of gold coins to pave the bedroom floor with. At that time she had dug deep into her heart, searching for the strength that would allow her to survive the misfortune, and she had discovered a reflective and just rage with which she had sworn to restore the fortune squandered by her lover and then wiped out by the deluge. It was such an unbreakable decision that Aureliano Segundo went back to her house eight months after the last message found her green disheveled, sunken eyelids and skin spangled with mange, but she was writing out numbers on small pieces of paper to make a raffle. Aureliano Segundo was astonished, and he was so dirty and so solemn that Petra Cotes almost believed that the one who had come to see her was not the lover of all her life but his twin brother.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then she told him to look in the bedroom and Aureliano Segundo saw the mule. Its skin was clinging to its bones like that of its mistress, but it was just as alive and resolute as she. Petra Cotes had fed it with her wrath, and when there was no more hay or corn or roots, she had given it shelter in her own bedroom and fed it on the percale sheets, the Persian rugs, the plush bedspreads, the velvet drapes, and the canopy embroidered with gold thread and silk tassels on the episcopal bed.</div>
