<div class="line_en">Jack whistled disgustedly between his teeth, sat straddling the peak of the roof, and examined his right index finger. It was swelling already, and he supposed he would have to try and creep past that nest to his ladder so he could go down and put some ice on it.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jack Torrance cried these words out in both surprise and agony as he slapped his right hand against his blue chambray workshirt, dislodging the big, slow-moving wasp that had stung him. Then he was scrambling up the roof as fast as he could, looking back over his shoulder to see if the wasp's brothers and sisters were rising from the nest he had uncovered to do battle. If they were, it could be bad; the nest was between him and his ladder, and the trapdoor leading down into the attic was locked from the inside. The drop was seventy feet from the roof to the cement patio between the hotel and the lawn.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰克—托兰斯被一只黄蜂蜇了。他一边痛苦地惊叫，一边用右手拍打蓝条纹布工作服，驱赶那只还在慢慢爬动的黄蜂。然后，他以最快的速度向屋脊爬去，不时地回过头，看看这只黄蜂的兄弟姐妹们是否也在赶来参战。要是真来了，那可就糟了。蜂窝刚好挡在他和梯子之间，而下到阁楼的活动天窗又反锁上了，屋顶到下面的那个水泥平台有70英尺高的落差。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was October 20. Wendy and Danny had gone down to Sidewinder in the hotel truck (an elderly, rattling Dodge that was still more trustworthy than the VW, which was now wheezing gravely and seemed terminal) to get three gallons of milk and do some Christmas shopping. It was early to shop, but there was no telling when the snow would come to stay. There had already been flurries, and in some places the road down from the Overlook was slick with patch ice.</div>

<div class="line_en">So far the fall had been almost preternaturally beautiful. In the three weeks they had been here, golden day had followed golden day. Crisp, thirty-degree mornings gave way to afternoon temperatures in the low sixties, the perfect temperature for climbing around on the Overlook's gently sloping western roof and doing the shingling. Jack had admitted freely to Wendy that he could have finished the job four days ago, but he felt no real urge to hurry. The view from up here was spectacular, even putting the vista from the Presidential Suite in the shade. More important, the work itself was soothing. On the roof he felt himself healing from the troubled wounds of the last three years. On the roof he felt at peace. Those three years began to seem like a turbulent nightmare.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到目前为止，秋天一直都很美丽。他们来到这儿的三个星期里，金色的日子一个接着一个，从未间断。上午30度，略有凉意。午后气温升到60度，正适合爬上饭店微微倾斜的西侧屋顶换木瓦。杰克曾向温迪坦白，四天前他就应该干完这活儿了，但他觉得没有必要这么着急。从这上面观赏到的景色真可谓奇绝壮观，甚至使总统套房窗外的美景都大为逊色。更重要的是，这活儿本身就让他感到宽慰。在屋顶上他觉得心气平和，感到过去三年遭受到的创伤正在愈合。过去这三年渐渐显得像一场汹涌的恶梦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The shingles had been badly rotted, some of them blown entirely away by last winter's storms.

<div class="line_en">But in the last twelve evenings, as he actually sat down in front of the office-model Underwood he had borrowed from the main office downstairs, the roadblock had disappeared under his fingers as magically as cotton candy dissolves on the lips. He had come up almost effortlessly with the insights into Denker's character that had always been lacking, and he had rewritten most of the second act accordingly, making it revolve around the new scene. And the progress of the third act, which he had been turning over in his mind when the wasp put an end to cogitation, was coming clearer all the time. He thought he could rough it out in two weeks, and have a clean copy of the whole damned play by New Year's.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，过去的12个晚上，他一坐到从楼下办公室借来的写字桌前，思路就神奇地打开了，下笔也如行云流水一般畅快。他没费多少事就洞悉了一直把握不好的邓克尔的性格，并相应地重写了第二幕的大部分内容，使之与新的情节相吻合。当黄蜂打断他思绪的时候，他正在脑子里斟酌第三幕，剧情的发展变得越来越清晰起来。他想，他可以在两周内写出初稿，并在新年前拿出整部剧本的誊清稿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The ironic part was that he warned himself each time he climbed onto the roof to keep an eye out for nests; he had gotten that bug bomb just in case. But this morning the stillness and peace had been so complete that his watchfulness had lapsed. He had been back in the world of the play he was slowly creating, roughing out whatever scene he would be working on that evening in his head. The play was going very well, and although Wendy had said little, he knew she was pleased. He had been roadblocked on the crucial scene between Denker, the sadistic headmaster, and Gary Benson, his young hero, during the last unhappy six months at Stovington, months when the craving for a drink had been so bad that he could barely concentrate on his in-class lectures, let alone his extracurricular literary ambitions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="令人啼笑皆非的是，每次上屋顶，他都警告过自己要当心蜂窝，为以防万一，他还买了那颗灭虫弹。今天上午他的心境极为宁静平和，以至于放松了警惕。他的心思又回到正慢慢成形的剧本上，脑子里构思着晚上将要写到的场景。近来他写得非常顺手，虽然温迪没说什么，但他知道她很满意。在斯托文顿那倒霉的六个月里，他在施虐狂邓克尔校长和年轻的主角加里—本森之间的一场关键戏上卡了壳，那时候，他想喝酒想得甚至讲课时都无法集中注意力，更别说什么业余的文学创作了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He had written back wryly that The Little School had been indefinitely -- and perhaps infinitely-delayed between hand and page "in that interesting intellectual Gobi known as the writer's block." Now it looked as if she might actually get the play. Whether or not it was any good or if it would ever see actual production was another matter. And he didn't seem to care a great deal about those things. He felt in a way that the play itself, the whole thing, was the roadblock, a colossal symbol of the bad years at Stovington Prep, the marriage he had almost totaled like a nutty kid behind the wheel of an old jalopy, the monstrous assault on his son, the incident in the parking lot with George Hatfield, an incident he could no longer view as just another sudden and destructive flare of temper. He now thought that part of his drinking problem had stemmed from an unconscious desire to be free of Stovington and the security he felt was stifling whatever creative urge he had. He had stopped drinking, but the need to be free had been just as great. Hence George Hatfield. Now all that remained of those days was the play on the desk in his and Wendy's bedroom, and when it was done and sent off to Phyllis's hole-in-the-wall New York agency, he could turn to other things. Not a novel, he was not ready to stumble into the swamp of another three-year undertaking, but surely more short stories. Perhaps a book of them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他回信诉苦说，眼前他脑子里简直是一片戈壁滩，《小学校》不定期地——或许无限期地推迟了。现在看来，她真的有望拿到这个剧本了。剧本能否带来好处、能否上演，那又另当别论，他似乎对此并不特别关心。他觉得，整个剧本本身就意味着思维短路，意味着他在斯托文顿预备学校的那些糟糕年头，意味着差点被他糊里糊涂地断送了的婚姻，意味着他施于儿子的暴行，意味着他在停车场与乔治—哈特菲尔德发生的冲突——他再也不能把此事仅仅看作是自己脾气的又一次突然发作了。现在他认为，他之所以酗酒，部分是因为他潜意识中渴望摆脱斯托文顿，摆脱那种将他的全部创作冲动扼杀殆尽的安全感。后来他戒了酒，但他对自由的渴求却丝毫未减，于是出了乔治—哈特菲尔德那件事。如今，那些日子残留下来的全部东西就只剩他和温迪卧室里写字桌上的那个剧本了。等写完了剧本、把它寄给菲利丝的纽约办事处，他会写点别的东西。不会是长篇小说，他不打算在另一件事上又一耗就是三年，但他肯定会写更多的短篇小说，也许整整一本。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He had an agent in New York, a tough red-headed woman named Phyllis Sandler who smoked Herbert Tareytons, drank Jim Beam from a paper cup, and thought the literary sun rose and set on Sean O'Casey. She had marketed three of Jack's short stories, including the Esquire piece. He had written her about the play, which was called The Little School, describing the basic conflict between Denker, a gifted student who had failed into becoming the brutal and brutalizing headmaster of a turn-of-the-century New England prep school, and Gary Benson, the student he sees as a younger version of himself. Phyllis had written back expressing interest and admonishing him to read O'Casey before sitting down to it. She had written again earlier that year asking where the hell was the play?</div>

<div class="line_en">Moving warily, he scrambled back down the slope of the roof on his hands and knees past the line of demarcation where the fresh green Bird shingles gave way to the section of roof he had just finished clearing. He came to the edge on the left of the wasps' nest he had uncovered and moved gingerly toward it, ready to backtrack and bolt down his ladder to the ground if things looked too hot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰克手脚并用，小心翼翼地在屋顶斜面上往下爬，经过了绿色的新木瓦与刚刚清理好的那片屋顶的分界线。他擦着蜂窝的左边轻手轻脚地挪动，心想要是情况不妙，就赶紧往回撤，顺着梯子逃回地面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Its shape was not perfect because the space between the flashing and the boards was too narrow, but he thought the little buggers had still done a pretty respectable job. The surface of the nest was acrawl with the lumbering, slow-moving insects. They were the big mean ones, not yellow jackets, which are smaller and calmer, but wall wasps. They had been rendered sludgy and stupid by the fall temperatures, but Jack, who knew about wasps from his childhood, counted himself lucky that he had been stung only once. And, he thought, if Ullman had hired the job done in the height of summer, the workman who tore up that particular section of the flashing would have gotten one hell of a surprise. Yes indeedy. When a dozen wall wasps land on you all at once and start stinging your face and hands and arms, stinging your legs right through your pants, it would be entirely possible to forget you were seventy feet up. You might just charge right off the edge of the roof while you were trying to get away from them. All from those little things, the biggest of them only half the length of a pencil stub.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因为空间太狭窄，它的形状不是太圆，但杰克想，这些小虫子活儿干得还相当不错。蜂窝表面爬满了密密麻麻的黄蜂。它们是那种凶狠的大家伙，不是个儿小一些、脾气温和一些的胡蜂，而是大黄蜂。秋天的凉爽天气已经使它们变得愚钝迟缓了，杰克从小就知道黄蜂的厉害，十分庆幸自己只被蜇了一下。他又想，如果厄尔曼在盛夏时节雇人干这活，干活儿的人揭到这里肯定会被吓得惊慌失措的。肯定会的。当十几只黄蜂突然落到你身上，蜇你的脸、你的手、你的胳膊，穿过裤子扎你的腿，你完全可能会忘记自己待在70英尺高的地方。在夺路逃跑时，你很可能直接就从屋檐上跳下去。一切都因为那些小东西，其中最大的也不过半截铅笔头那么长。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Either way it's bang!… all over. And the insect, usually completely unharmed, would buzz merrily out of the smoking wreck, looking for greener pastures. The trooper had been in favor of having pathologists look for insect venom while autopsying such victims, Jack recalled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不管怎样，哐…一切都完了。而虫子却通常毫毛无损，快乐地嗡嗡叫着飞出浓烟滚滚的残骸，径自寻找更肥美的猎物去了。杰克记得州警官还主张，法医解剖这类遇难者的时候应该找找昆虫毒液。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He had read someplace -- in a Sunday supplement piece or a back-of-the-book newsmagazine article -- that 7 per cent of all automobile fatalities go unexplained. No mechanical failure, no excessive speed, no booze, no bad weather. Simply one-car crashes on deserted sections of road, one dead occupant, the driver, unable to explain what had happened to him. The article had included an interview with a state trooper who theorized that many of these so-called "foo crashes" resulted from insects in the car. Wasps, a bee, possibly even a spider or moth. The driver gets panicky, tries to swat it or unroll a window to let it out. Possibly the insect stings him. Maybe the driver just loses control.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰克曾在什么地方——一篇周末增刊的豆腐块或新闻杂志的封底文章——读到过，7％的致命车祸无法解释。既非机械故障、超速行驶，又非酒后驾驶或天气恶劣。很简单，在荒无人烟的路段上，车翻了，司机死了，不知道他怎么了。文章里有一段对州警官的采访，他推测，这类所谓的“无头车祸”的肇事者大多是车子里的昆虫。黄蜂，蜜蜂，甚至可能是蜘蛛或飞蛾。司机惊慌失措，想拍死虫子或开窗放它出去。也许虫子蜇了他，也许司机自己失去了控制。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now, looking down into the nest, it seemed to him that it could serve as both a workable symbol for what he had been through (and what he had dragged his hostages to fortune through) and an omen for a better future. How else could you explain the things that had happened to him? For he still felt that the whole range of unhappy Stovington experiences had to be looked at with Jack Torrance in the passive mode. He had not done things; things had been done to him. He had known plenty of people on the Stovington faculty, two of them right in the English Department, who were hard drinkers. Zack Tunney was in the habit of picking up a full keg of beer on Saturday afternoon, plonking it in a backyard snowbank overnight, and then killing damn near all of it on Sunday watching football games and old movies. Yet through the week Zack was as sober as a judge -- a weak cocktail with lunch was an occasion.</div>

It had nothing to do with willpower, or the morality of drinking, or the weakness or strength of his own character.

He had always regarded himself as Jack Torrance, a really nice guy who was just going to have to learn how to cope with his temper someday before it got him in trouble. The same way he was going to have to learn how to cope with his drinking. But he had been an emotional alcoholic just as surely as he had been a physical one -- the two of them were no doubt tied together somewhere deep inside him, where you'd just as soon not look. But it didn't much matter to him if the root causes were interrelated or separate, sociological or psychological or physiological. He had had to deal with the results: the spankings, the beatings from his old man, the suspensions, with trying to explain the school clothes torn in playground brawls, and later the hangovers, the slowly dissolving glue of his marriage, the single bicycle wheel with its bent spokes pointing into the sky, Danny's broken arm. And George Hatfield, of course.</div>

<div class="line_en">He had gone out and hurled a rock at a passing car. His father had seen that, and he had descended on little Jacky, roaring. He had reddened Jack's behind… and then blacked his eye. And when his father had gone into the house, muttering, to see what was on television, Jack had come upon a stray dog and had kicked it into the gutter. There had been two dozen fights in grammar school, even more of them in high school, warranting two suspensions and uncounted detentions in spite of his good grades. Football had provided a partial safety valve, although he remembered perfectly well that he had spent almost every minute of every game in a state of high piss-off, taking every opposing block and tackle personally. He had been a fine player, making All-Conference in his junior and senior years, and he knew perfectly well that he had his own bad temper to thank… or to blame. He had not enjoyed football. Every game was a grudge match.</div>

<div class="line_en">He had stuck his hand through some rotted flashing in high summer and that hand and his whole arm had been consumed in holy, righteous fire, destroying conscious thought, making the concept of civilized behavior obsolete. Could you be expected to behave as a thinking human being when your hand was being impaled on red-hot darning needles? Could you be expected to live in the love of your nearest and dearest when the brown, furious cloud rose out of the hole in the fabric of things (the fabric you thought was so innocent) and arrowed straight at you? Could you be held responsible for your own actions as you ran crazily about on the sloping roof seventy feet above the ground, not knowing where you were going, not remembering that your panicky, stumbling feet could lead you crashing and blundering right over the rain gutter and down to your death on the concrete seventy feet below?

<div class="line_en">George had floated through his classes at Stovington. A soccer and baseball star, his academic program had been fairly undemanding and he had been content with C's and an occasional B in history or botany. He was a fierce field contender but a lackadaisical, amused sort of student in the classrooms Jack was familiar with the type, more from his own days as a high school and college student than from his teaching experience, which was at second hand. George Hatfield was a jock. He could be a calm, undemanding figure in the classroom, but when the right set of competitive stimuli was applied (like electrodes to the temples of Frankenstein's monster, Jack thought wryly), he could become a juggernaut.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在预备学校，乔治对功课的态度是得过且过。对一名足球和棒球双料明星来说，文化课成绩并不那么重要，他对“及格”和在历史或植物学课上偶尔得的“中等”颇为满足。他一上球场就生龙活虎，一进课堂就无精打采。杰克熟悉这类学生，与其说源于他在教学中获得的二手体会，不如说源于他本人中学和大学时的经验。乔治是个运动员，在教室里他可以沉默寡言、不求进取，可一旦受到适当的刺激，他就会变成一个盖世英雄。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In January, George had tried out with two dozen others for the debate team. He had been quite frank with Jack. His father was a corporation lawyer, and he wanted his son to follow in his footsteps. George, who felt no burning call to do anything else, was willing. His grades were not top end, but this was, after all, only prep school and it was still early times. If should be came to must be, his father could pull some strings. George's own athletic ability would open still other doors. But Brian Hatfield thought his son should get on the debate team. It was good practice, and it was something that law-school admissions boards always looked for. So George went out for debate, and in late March Jack cut him from the team.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那年一月，乔治和另外二十多人参加了辩论队的选拔赛。他对杰克坦诚相告，他父亲是一名公司法律顾问，希望儿子步他的后尘。乔治本人并无他事非干不可，因此也愿意。他的成绩并不拔尖，但这毕竟还只是预备学校，人生还刚刚开始。如果他今后非得学法律，他父亲本可以走走后门。乔治本人的运动才能也可以为他打开一些方便之门。但布莱恩—哈特菲尔德认为，他儿子应该参加辩论队。这是很好的锻炼，法律学院录取委员会总是看重这东西。于是，乔治上阵参加了辩论，三月底，杰克把他淘汰了。">查看中文翻译</div>

It was painful to watch.</div>

<div class="line_en">The late winter inter-squad debates had fired George Hatfield's competitive soul. He became a grimly determined debater, prepping his pro or con position fiercely. It didn't matter if the subject was legalization of marijuana, reinstating the death penalty, or the oil-depletion allowance. George became conversant, and he was just jingoist enough to honestly not care which side he was on -- a rare and valuable trait', even in high-level debaters, Jack knew. The souls of a true carpetbagger and a true debater were not far removed from each other; they were both passionately interested in the main chance. So far, so good.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你们可以回家了，”他平静地对他们说。“明天见。”但是，到这周末，六名辩论队员退了队，其中两个还是优等生。当然，这对他已无关紧要，因为那时候他自己已接到了走人的通知。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jack put his hands on George's chest and pushed him back down. "Lie still," he said. "Don't try to move." He turned to Miss Strong, who was staring at them both with horror.</div>

<div class="line_en">But he had known nothing. Nothing. He would swear that before the Throne of Almighty God, just as he would swear that he had set the timer ahead no more than a minute. And not out of hate but out of pity.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Please go call the school doctor, Miss Strong," be told her. She turned and fled toward the office. He looked at his debate class then, looked them right in the eye because he was in charge again, fully himself, and when he was himself there wasn't a nicer guy in the whole state of Vermont. Surely they knew that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“斯特朗小姐，请打电话叫校医，”他告诉她。斯特朗小姐转身向办公室奔去。杰克看着自己的辩论队，不回避他们的目光，因为他又能自持了，而当他处于常态的时候，整个佛蒙特州再也找不出比他好的人了。他们当然知道这一点。">查看中文翻译</div>

It was possible to graduate from passive to active, to take the thing that had once driven you nearly to madness as a neutral prize of no more than occasional academic interest. And if there was a place where the thing could be done, this was surely it.</div>
