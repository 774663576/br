<div class="line_en">I sighed. She would be awake soon. It must be nearly seven in the morning. Would she be looking for me? Abruptly, something close to panic had my body freezing up. What would she look like today?</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="不到一会儿，爱德华提起了那个我现在最优先考虑的人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I probably looked like a cartoon, the way I sprung up, then looked back at him -- his diamond body faintly glinting in the diffuse light -- then away to the west, where Renesmee waited, then back at him again, then back toward her, my head whipping from side to side a half dozen times in a second. Edward smiled, but didn't laugh; he was a strong man.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我像个卡通人物一样猛地蹦起来，看着他——他钻石般的身体在周围弥漫的光线照耀下闪闪发光——然后看向蕾妮斯梅所在的西方，接着又看着他，脑袋来回晃了几十次。爱德华微笑着，没出声，他真的很伟大。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That would have to be enough to get me through the daylight hours. I would balance this overwhelming, devastating desire so that I could be a good -- It was hard to think the word. Though Renesmee was very real and vital in my life, it was still difficult to think of myself as a mother. I supposed anyone would feel the same, though, without nine months to get used to the idea. And with a child that changed by the hour.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我想有这句话就足够让我熬过漫长的白天了，能好好的平衡这无法压抑的毁灭性的渴望，做一个好的——要说出这个词不是太容易。虽然蕾妮斯梅现在已经是非常真实和重要的一个人，但把自己当成一个母亲还是有点困难。不过我猜任何人身处我的位置，都会有一样的想法，毕竟我没有那漫长的九个月来适应这个称呼，还有一个时刻不停的快速成长的孩子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The thought of Renesmee's speeding life had me stressed-out again in an instant. I didn't even pause at the ornately carved double doors to catch my breath before finding out what Alice had done. I just burst through, intent on wearing the first things I touched. I should have known it wouldn't be that easy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="想着蕾妮斯梅被加速的生命，我就感到一阵喘不过气的压力。猛地推开那扇雕刻精美的华丽柜门，我甚至没有停下来好好看一眼，想着直接抓住第一眼看到的衣服就往身上套——我早就该知道这不会很容易的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Which ones are mine?" I hissed. As promised, the room was bigger than our bedroom. It might have been bigger than the rest of the house put together, but I'd have to pace it off to be positive. I had a brief mental flash of Alice trying to persuade Esme to ignore classic proportions and allow this monstrosity. I wondered how Alice had won that one.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哪些是我的？”我悄悄的问。就像爱德华之前说的，这衣柜比我们睡房还大，我甚至怀疑它有整个别墅剩下的房间加起来那么大，要想步测它的面积得在里面踱半天。真想知道爱丽丝是怎样说服埃斯梅忽略这严重不成比例的房间，她是用了什么方法来取胜？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Let me help," Edward offered. He sniffed carefully at the air and then followed some scent to the back of the long room. There was a built-in dresser there. He sniffed again, then opened a drawer. With a triumphant grin, he held out a pair of artfully faded blue jeans.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我来帮忙吧，”爱德华殷勤的说，他深深的吸了一口气，顺着某种特殊的气味走到这狭长的房间的最后面，那边的墙壁上嵌着一个梳妆台。他又闻了一下，然后打开一个抽屉，露出胜利的微笑，拿出一条充满艺术感的蓝色水磨牛仔裤。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Fine," I muttered, and I pulled down the zipper on the closest bag. I growled under my breath when I saw the floorlength silk gown inside -- baby pink.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“谢谢，”我感激涕零的说，也试着自己去嗅着各种布料，记住他们的味道，以备未来这个疯狂的房间所需。我已经记住了丝绸和缎子的味道，以后闻到它们绝对有多远走多远。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It only took him seconds to find his own clothes -- if I hadn't seen him undressed, I would have sworn there was nothing more beautiful than Edward in his khakis and pale beige pullover -- and then he took my hand. We darted through the hidden garden, leaped lightly over the stone wall, and hit the forest at a dead sprint. I pulled my hand free so that we could race back. He beat me this time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他只花了几秒钟就找到要穿的衣服——如果不是我刚才还看到他什么都没穿的样子，我发誓我肯定会以为他现在是全世界最帅的人——穿着米黄色卡其布套衫。接着他拉起我的手，我们穿过秘密花园，轻轻跳过石头矮围墙，飞快的冲向森林。我放下爱德华的手这样我们就能比赛谁先到家，这次他打败了我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Renesmee was awake; she was sitting up on the floor with Rose and Emmett hovering over her, playing with a little pile of twisted silverware. She had a mangled spoon in her right hand. As soon as she spied me through the glass, she chucked the spoon on the floor -- where it left a divot in the wood -- and pointed in my direction imperiously. Her audience laughed; Alice, Jasper, Esme, and Carlisle were sitting on the couch, watching her as if she were the most engrossing film.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="蕾妮斯梅已经醒了，她坐在罗莎和埃美特之间的地板上，玩着一件形状诡异的银器，右手拿着一个扭断了的汤匙。当她发现我正在穿过草地的时候，马上把汤匙往地上一扔，任性的指着我。她的观众都笑起来：爱丽丝、贾斯帕、埃斯梅还有坐在沙发上像在看着最有趣的电影一样看着她的卡莱尔。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I was through the door before their laughter had barely begun, bounding across the room and scooping her up from the floor in the same second. We smiled widely at each other.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在他们还没笑出声的时候，我就到门口了，飞过房间从地上一把把她抱起来，两人对着对方开心的笑起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She was different, but not so much. A little longer again, her proportions drifting from babyish to childlike. Her hair was longer by a quarter inch, the curls bouncing like springs with every movement. I'd let my imagination run wild on the trip back, and I'd imagined worse than this. Thanks to my overdone fears, these little changes were almost a relief. Even without Carlisle's measurements, I was sure the changes were slower than yesterday.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的确变了，但不是太多。这次她从婴儿的外表变的有点像儿童了。头发大概长长了四分之一寸，小卷毛像泉水一样跳跃着。在回来的路上，我想象中她的样子要比现在恐怖，感谢我杞人忧天的害怕，现在她这些小改变简直就像是安慰一样。即使卡莱尔不去测量我也很确定，生长的确变慢了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="蕾妮斯梅拍拍我的脸，我犹豫了一下，她说她又饿了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"How long has she been up?" I asked as Edward disappeared through the kitchen doorway. I was sure he was on his way to get her breakfast, having seen what she'd just thought as clearly as I had. I wondered if he would ever have noticed her little quirk, if he'd been the only one to know her. To him, it probably would have seemed like hearing anyone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“她起来了多久？”我问道，看见爱德华的身影消失在厨房门口。我知道他去帮她准备早餐了，而且肯定和我一样看见她刚才说的话。我不知道他原来是不是注意过她的小暗示，如果他是唯一一个能听懂她的人的话。不过对他来说，可能和听其他人的心里话没什么区别。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="埃斯梅还没回答，埃美特就笑出来了——这次他笑出声来了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"So it's still standing?" he managed to get out between his snickers. "I would've thought you two had knocked it to rubble by now. What were you doing last night? Discussing the national debt?" He howled with laughter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这么说那房子还好好的？”他好不容易止住笑，问：“我还以为你们俩绝对会拆了那房子。你们昨晚干了啥？讨论国家财政赤字？”他笑的快喘不过气来了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Rosalie bit her lip and looked away, trying not to laugh. I could feel Emmett's silent laughter behind me, sending vibrations through the foundations of the house. I kept my chin high. "We'll get your room set up right away," I said to Renesmee. "You'll like the cottage. It's magic." I look up at Esme. "Thank you, Esme. So much. It's absolutely perfect."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Just a few minutes," Rose said. "We would have called you soon. She's been asking for you -- demanding might be a better description.

<div class="line_en">"What was he so upset about?" Edward asked as he came back into the room with Renesmee's cup. There must have been more in Rosalie's memory than I'd seen in her expression.</div>

<div class="line_en">Without breathing, I handed Renesmee off to Rosalie. Super-self-control, maybe, but there was no way I was going to be able to feed her. Not yet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="屏着呼吸，我把蕾妮斯梅递给罗莎莉。虽然有“超级自控力”，但是让我自己来喂她还是太勉强，暂时来说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don't know -- or care," Rosalie grumbled, but she answered Edward's question more fully. "He was watching Nessie sleep, his mouth hanging open like the moron he is, and then he just jumped to his feet without any kind of trigger -- that I noticed, anyway -- and stormed out. I was glad to be rid of him. The more time he spends here, the less chance there is that we'll ever get the smell out."</div>

"I'm sure you'll ace your classes… apparently there's nothing interesting for you to do at night besides study."</div>

<div class="line_en">Alice held out her hand. There was a small white box on her palm. "These will irritate your eyes -- they won't hurt, but they'll cloud your vision. It's annoying. They also won't match your old color, but it's still better than bright red, right?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱丽丝伸出手，掌心放着一个白色的小盒子：“它们能挡住你眼睛的颜色——没什么伤害，但会让视力变得模糊，很烦人。当然，跟你原来的颜色不一样，可还是比亮红色好，不是吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I nodded and opened the container. I'd never worn contacts before, but it couldn't be that hard. I took the little brown quarter-sphere and pressed it, concave side in, to my eye.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes, yes, she always looks gorgeous," Alice finished his thought impatiently. "It's better than red, but that's the highest commendation I can give. Muddy brown. Your brown was much prettier. Keep in mind that those won't last forever -- the venom in your eyes will dissolve them in a few hours. So if Charlie stays longer than that, you'll have to excuse yourself to replace them. Which is a good idea anyway, because humans need bathroom breaks." She shook her head. "Esme, give her a few pointers on acting human while I stock the powder room with contacts."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好了，好了，她一直都是这么光彩照人，”爱丽丝不耐烦的抢先把他的话说完：“比红色要好些，但这已经是我能说的最好听的话了。泥坑的棕色。你原来的褐色要可爱多了。但记住这不会持续很长时间——你眼睛里的毒素会在几小时内腐蚀掉它们。所以如果查理待的时间比那更长，你得找借口让他动下。还好，人类总是需要解决下生理问题。”她摇摇头：“埃斯梅，给她点提示如何做的更像人类，我去下化妆间，保持联系。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Fine," Alice groaned. "Hold her as still as you can and I'll try to see around her." She sighed wearily, like she'd been asked to work overtime on a holiday. Jacob sighed, too, but brought Renesmee to me, and then retreated quickly from Alice's glare.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，”爱丽丝无奈的说：“抱着她尽量别动，我看看能不能透过她周围的情况来猜猜后面的事。”她疲惫的叹了口气，在这个假期里她似乎一直在超负荷工作。雅各布在那边也叹了口气，但还是把蕾妮斯梅送过来，接着就在爱丽丝的瞪视下迅速退开。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="查理的气味点燃了我身体的火焰，狠狠的撞击着我的喉咙。可是，这比远远不止是疼痛，还伴有更多火热尖锐的渴望。查理比我想象的所有东西都要香，起码有我打猎时碰到的徒步旅行者两倍诱人。而且他离我只有几步远，在这片干燥的空气中，散发着让人口水直流的温度和气味。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="慢慢的，查理从房那边走来，在我身前的几步处停下来。他给了爱德华一个指责的眼神，接着目光闪烁的看着我。那温暖的身体里，心脏的每一次跳动都像在狠狠的抽打着我。">查看中文翻译</div>
