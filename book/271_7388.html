<div class="line_en">Funny, though, I'd've thought her biggest issue would just be me. We'd always gotten on each other's nerves when we were in Sam's pack. But there was no antagonism toward me now at all, just the Cullens and Bella. I wondered why. Maybe it was simply gratitude that I wasn't forcing her to leave. Maybe it was because I understood her hostility better now. Whichever, running with Leah wasn't nearly as bad as I'd expected.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然说出来很好笑，本来我以为她面临的最大难题将会是我。当还在山姆队伍里的时候，我们两个之间就火药味十足。不过她现在对我是不再会有敌意了，而是转而针对卡伦一家和贝拉。我想不通为什么，也许只是为了对我没有将她撵回家去表示谢意。也许因为我现在更能理解她这份敌对的心情。哪个原因都好，和利亚一起巡逻并没有预料中那么糟糕。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was easier to run with him than it was to do the same with Leah. Though she was trying -- trying hard -- there was always an edge to her thoughts. She didn't want to be here. She didn't want to feel the softening toward the vampires that was going on in my head. She didn't want to deal with Seth's cozy friendship with them, a friendship that was only getting stronger.</div>

<div class="line_en">I was thinking about that, I agreed. But let's do it when we're all awake. I don't want to let down our guard. We should do it before the Cullens give it a try, though. Soon.</div>

<div class="line_en">Of course, she hadn't eased up that much. The food and clothes Esme had sent for her were all taking a trip downriver right now. Even after I'd eaten my share -- not because it smelled nearly irresistible away from the vampire burn, but to set a good example of self-sacrificing tolerance for Leah -- she'd refused. The small elk she'd taken down around noon had not totally satisfied her appetite. Did make her mood worse, though. Leah hated eating raw.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，她还没能那么快就放松下来。所有埃斯米送给她的衣服和食物现在正顺着水流漂向河的下游。即使我已经消灭了属于我的那份，因为撇开吸血鬼残留的气味不谈，它们闻起来实在是可口诱人，但是在利亚看来，我不过是自我牺牲为她做了个榜样罢了，于是拒绝了。她中午猎捕到的一头小小的麋鹿完全满足不了她的胃口。更加让利亚心情阴郁的是，她恨死了吃生肉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Right.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没错。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">If the Cullens were able to get out of the immediate area safely, they really ought to keep on going. They probably should have taken off the second we'd come to warn them. They had to be able to afford other digs. And they had friends up north, right? Take Bella and run. It seemed like an obvious answer to their problems.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果卡伦的家人能够安全地出了这个地区，他们就应该有多远走多远。在那里，他们都不需要我们帮他们望风。另外选个地方落脚对他们来说也不会是问题，而且他们在北方有朋友，不是吗？带上贝拉离开。要解决他们的问题这似乎是个最显而易见的办法了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I had to remind myself that I'd just decided to give the Cullens that exact advice. That it was best. So I shouldn't be mad at Seth for taking the chore out of my hands. Not mad at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我想起来刚刚是我决定了要给卡伦一家那个建议。说这是最佳的选择。所以我不应该责怪塞思替我跑了腿。一点都不应该生气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">No, that was stupid. I would tell them to go. It made no sense for them to stay, and it would be better -- not less painful, but healthier -- for me if Bella left.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不行，这未免太过愚蠢。我应该让他们走。他们留在这里毫无意义，而且对我来说，如果贝拉离开，会对我更好——虽然心依旧会抽痛，但是这种痛对身体却更为健康。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Oh, I already asked Edward about that, Seth thought.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="噢，关于这事我早就问过爱德华了，塞思想。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I probably ought to suggest that, but I was afraid they would listen to me. And I didn't want to have Bella disappear -- to never know whether she'd made it or not.</div>

<div class="line_en">Not really, Seth said, defensive now. It takes some time to build up the kind of medical access that Carlisle has here. He's got all the stuff he needs to take care of Bella, and the credentials to get more. That's one of the reasons they want to make a hunting run. Carlisle thinks they're going to need more blood for Bella soon. She's using up all the O negative they stored for her. He doesn't like depleting the stockpile. He's going to buy some more. Did you know you can buy blood? If you're a doctor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不能这么说。塞思替他们辩护说道。卡莱尔在这里花了相当的时间设置那些医疗设施。他有一整套的设备可以看护贝拉，而且凭他的身份证件还能搞到更多的血。这是他们去打猎的目的之一。卡莱尔认为他们很快就需要给予贝拉更多的血。她正在消耗掉所有他们为她储备的ORH阴性血。他不希望耗尽最后一滴库存。他会再去购入更多的血。你知道怎么购买血吗？只要你是一名医生。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">No. They're not leaving.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不。他们不会离开。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I bit my tongue to keep from saying what I wanted to say -- hard enough that I tasted blood in my mouth. Of course, it would heal before I could swallow. That's what Bella needed. To be strong like me, to be able to heal…</div>
