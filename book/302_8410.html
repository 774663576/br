<div class="line_en">Marianne's illness, though weakening in its kind, had not been longenough to make her recovery slow; and with youth, natural strength, andher mother's presence in aid, it proceeded so smoothly as to enable herto remove, within four days after the arrival of the latter, into Mrs. Palmer's dressing-room. When there, at her own particular request, forshe was impatient to pour forth her thanks to him for fetching hermother, Colonel Brandon was invited to visit her.</div>

<div class="line_en">At the end of another day or two, Marianne growing visibly strongerevery twelve hours, Mrs. Dashwood, urged equally by her own and herdaughter's wishes, began to talk of removing to Barton. On HERmeasures depended those of her two friends; Mrs. Jennings could notquit Cleveland during the Dashwoods' stay; and Colonel Brandon was soonbrought, by their united request, to consider his own abode there asequally determinate, if not equally indispensable. At his and Mrs. Jennings's united request in return, Mrs. Dashwood was prevailed on toaccept the use of his carriage on her journey back, for the betteraccommodation of her sick child; and the Colonel, at the jointinvitation of Mrs. Dashwood and Mrs. Jennings, whose active good-naturemade her friendly and hospitable for other people as well as herself, engaged with pleasure to redeem it by a visit at the cottage, in thecourse of a few weeks.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Dashwoods were two days on the road, and Marianne bore her journeyon both, without essential fatigue. Every thing that the most zealousaffection, the most solicitous care could do to render her comfortable, was the office of each watchful companion, and each found their rewardin her bodily ease, and her calmness of spirits. To Elinor, theobservation of the latter was particularly grateful. She, who had seenher week after week so constantly suffering, oppressed by anguish ofheart which she had neither courage to speak of, nor fortitude toconceal, now saw with a joy, which no other could equally share, anapparent composure of mind, which, in being the result as she trustedof serious reflection, must eventually lead her to contentment andcheerfulness.</div>

<div class="line_en">The day of separation and departure arrived; and Marianne, after takingso particular and lengthened a leave of Mrs. Jennings, one so earnestlygrateful, so full of respect and kind wishes as seemed due to her ownheart from a secret acknowledgment of past inattention, and biddingColonel Brandon farewell with a cordiality of a friend, was carefullyassisted by him into the carriage, of which he seemed anxious that sheshould engross at least half. Mrs. Dashwood and Elinor then followed, and the others were left by themselves, to talk of the travellers, andfeel their own dullness, till Mrs. Jennings was summoned to her chaiseto take comfort in the gossip of her maid for the loss of her two youngcompanions; and Colonel Brandon immediately afterwards took hissolitary way to Delaford.</div>

<div class="line_en">As they approached Barton, indeed, and entered on scenes of which everyfield and every tree brought some peculiar, some painful recollection, she grew silent and thoughtful, and turning away her face from theirnotice, sat earnestly gazing through the window. But here, Elinorcould neither wonder nor blame; and when she saw, as she assistedMarianne from the carriage, that she had been crying, she saw only anemotion too natural in itself to raise any thing less tender than pity, and in its unobtrusiveness entitled to praise. In the whole of hersubsequent manner, she traced the direction of a mind awakened toreasonable exertion; for no sooner had they entered their commonsitting-room, than Marianne turned her eyes around it with a look ofresolute firmness, as if determined at once to accustom herself to thesight of every object with which the remembrance of Willoughby could beconnected. -- She said little, but every sentence aimed at cheerfulness, and though a sigh sometimes escaped her, it never passed away withoutthe atonement of a smile. After dinner she would try her piano-forte. She went to it; but the music on which her eye first rested was anopera, procured for her by Willoughby, containing some of theirfavourite duets, and bearing on its outward leaf her own name in hishand-writing. -- That would not do. -- She shook her head, put the musicaside, and after running over the keys for a minute, complained offeebleness in her fingers, and closed the instrument again; declaringhowever with firmness as she did so, that she should in future practicemuch.</div>

I know we shallbe happy. I know the summer will pass happily away. I mean never tobe later in rising than six, and from that time till dinner I shalldivide every moment between music and reading. I have formed my plan, and am determined to enter on a course of serious study. Our ownlibrary is too well known to me, to be resorted to for any thing beyondmere amusement. But there are many works well worth reading at thePark; and there are others of more modern production which I know I canborrow of Colonel Brandon.

Her smile however changed to a sigh when sheremembered that promise to Willoughby was yet unfulfilled, and fearedshe had that to communicate which might again unsettle the mind ofMarianne, and ruin at least for a time this fair prospect of busytranquillity.

<div class="line_en">-- No; -- not less when I knew you to be unhappy, than when I hadbelieved you at ease, did I turn away from every exertion of duty or friendship; scarcely allowing sorrow to exist but with me, regrettingonly THAT heart which had deserted and wronged me, and leaving you, for whom I professed an unbounded affection, to be miserable for my sake." Here ceased the rapid flow of her self-reproving spirit;</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没有。我无论是认为你称心如意的时候，还是得知你的不幸之后，都没尽到职责和友情。我简直不承认除我之外谁还会有什么悲伤。我只对遗弃、亏待了我的那个人感到懊恼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But you, -- you above all, above my mother, had been wronged by me. I, and only I, knew your heart and its sorrows; yet to what did it influence me? -- not to anycompassion that could benefit you or myself. -- Your example was beforeme; but to what avail? -- Was I more considerate of you and your comfort? Did I imitate your forbearance, or lessen your restraints, by taking any part in those offices of general complaisance or part iculargratitude which you had hitherto been left to dischargealone?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是你，首先是你，而不是母亲，倒被我冤枉了。我，而且只有我，了解你的心事和悲痛。然而，这对我有什么作用呢？没有引起对你我都有好处的任何同情。你为我树立了榜样，可是有什么用呢？我对你和你的安适更体贴了吗？我有没有效仿你的涵养功夫，设法减少一下你的负担，也来承担一点诸如奉承恭维、感恩戴德之类的事情，而不至于让你在那里独自应酬呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">and Elinor, impatient to soothe, though too honest to flatter, gave her instantlythat praise and support which her frankness and her contrition so well deserved. Marianne pressed her hand and replied,</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃丽诺虽然是个诚实人，不爱说恭维话，但是她急于要安慰妹妹，当即对她表示了赞扬和鼓励；而玛丽安凭着自己的坦率和悔悟，也完全应该受到赞扬和鼓励。玛丽安紧握着姐姐的手，回答说：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You are very good. -- The future must be my proof. I have laid down myplan, and if I am capable of adhering to it-my feelings shall begoverned and my temper improved. They shall no longer worry others, nor torture myself. I shall now live solely for my family. You, mymother, and Margaret, must henceforth be all the world to me; you willshare my affections entirely between you. From you, from my home, Ishall never again have the smallest incitement to move; and if I do mixin other society, it will be only to shew that my spirit is humbled, myheart amended, and that I can practise the civilities, the lesserduties of life, with gentleness and forbearance. As for Willoughby-tosay that I shall soon or that I shall ever forget him, would be idle. His remembrance can be overcome by no change of circumstances oropinions. But it shall be regulated, it shall be checked by religion, by reason, by constant employment."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你真好。“你真好。未来一定会给我作证。我已经订好了计划，如果我能坚决执行的话，我就会控制住自己的情感，改变自己的脾气。这就不会再使别人感到烦恼，也不会使我自己感到痛苦。现在，我将只为自家人活着。你、母亲和玛格丽特今后就是我的一切，你们三人将分享我全部的爱。我决不会再产生丝毫杂念，想离开你们，离开我的家。如果我真与外人交往，那只是为了表明：我的态度已经变得谦恭起来，我的心灵已经改过自新，我也可以文质彬彬、宽宏大量地讲讲礼仪答套，履行一下生活中的繁文辱节。至于威洛比，要是说我很快就会忘掉他，或者说迟早总会忘掉他，那是毫无意义的。无论环境和看法如何改变，我是忘不掉他的。不过，这要有个控制，要通过宗教信仰、理智和不停的忙碌，来加以遏制。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She paused-and added in a low voice, "If I could but know his heart, everything would become easy." Elinor, who had now been for some time reflecting on the propriety orimpropriety of speedily hazarding her narration, without feeling at allnearer decision than at first, heard this; and perceiving that asreflection did nothing, resolution must do all, soon found herselfleading to the fact.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽安顿了顿，接着又低声补充了一句：“假如我能了解他的心，那么一切事情都好办了。”埃丽诺听到这话时，已经有好一阵子都在考虑马上把话说出去是否恰当，结果还像起先一样犹豫不决。她发觉，既然左思右想都不解决问题，干脆下个决心不就什么都解决了，于是她立即讲起事实真相。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She managed the recital, as she hoped, with address; prepared heranxious listener with caution; related simply and honestly the chiefpoints on which Willoughby grounded his apology; did justice to hisrepentance, and softened only his protestations of present regard. Marianne said not a word. -- She trembled, her eyes were fixed on theground, and her lips became whiter than even sickness had left them. Athousand inquiries sprung up from her heart, but she dared not urgeone. She caught every syllable with panting eagerness; her hand, unknowingly to herself, closely pressed her sister's, and tears coveredher cheeks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正像她希望的那样，她力求说得策略一些，谨慎小心地使她那位迫不及待的听话人做好思想准备。她简单忠实地叙说了威洛比作为辩解依据的主要论点，如实地传达了他的悔过之意，只是对他现在的爱慕表示说得比较委婉。玛丽安一声不响。她在索索发抖，两眼盯着地上，嘴唇在病后本来就是苍白的，现在变得更加苍白。上千个问题涌上她的心头，但是她一个也不敢提出。她急不可耐地一字不漏地倾听着，一只手不知不觉地紧紧握住了姐姐的手，脸上沾满了泪水。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Elinor, dreading her being tired, led her towards home; and till theyreached the door of the cottage, easily conjecturing what her curiositymust be though no question was suffered to speak it, talked of nothingbut Willoughby, and their conversation together; and was carefullyminute in every particular of speech and look, where minuteness couldbe safely indulged. As soon as they entered the house, Marianne with akiss of gratitude and these two words just articulate through hertears, "Tell mama," withdrew from her sister and walked slowly upstairs. Elinor would not attempt to disturb a solitude so reasonableas what she now sought; and with a mind anxiously pre-arranging itsresult, and a resolution of reviving the subject again, should Mariannefail to do it, she turned into the parlour to fulfill her partinginjunction.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃丽诺怕她劳累，领着她朝家里走去。虽然玛丽安嘴里没有直说，但是埃丽诺很容易猜到她一定对什么感兴趣。因此，在到达乡舍门口之前，她一直在谈论威洛比以及他们之间的谈话。有关他言谈神态的每一个细节，凡是说出来没有妨碍的，她总要津津乐道地说个仔细。她们一进屋，玛丽安就不胜感激地吻了姐姐—下，并且流着眼泪，清晰可辨地说出了几个字：“告诉妈妈，”随后便离开姐姐，缓步朝楼上走去。她想独自清静一下，这是合情合理的，埃丽诺也就不便打扰。她忧心忡忡地预测这清静的结果，并且决计在妹妹万一不再重提此事的时候帮她重新提起，于是她走进客厅，去完成玛丽安临别时交代的使命。">查看中文翻译</div>
