<div class="line_en">Now, there was an old manor-house, where they no longer ate snails, they were quite extinct; but the burdocks were not extinct, they grew and grew all over the walks and all the beds; they could not get the mastery over them-it was a whole forest of burdocks. Here and there stood an apple and a plum-tree, or else one never would have thought that it was a garden; all was burdocks, and there lived the two last venerable old snails.</div>

<div class="line_en">Really, the largest green leaf in this country is a dock-leaf; if one holds it before one, it is like a whole apron, and if one holds it over one's head in rainy weather, it is almost as good as an umbrella, for it is so immensely large. The burdock never grows alone, but where there grows one there always grow several: it is a great delight, and all this delightfulness is snails' food. The great white snails which persons of quality in former times made fricassees of, ate, and said, "Hem, hem! how delicious!" for they thought it tasted so delicate-lived on dock-leaves, and therefore burdock seeds weresown.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title='这个国家里最大的绿叶子，无疑要算是牛蒡的叶子了。你拿一起放在你的肚皮上，那么它就像一条围裙。如果你把它放在头上，那么在雨天里它就可以当做一把伞用，因为它是出奇的宽大。牛蒡从来不单独地生长；不，凡是长着一棵牛蒡的地方，你一定可以找到好几棵。这是它最可爱的一点，而这一点对蜗牛说来只不过是食料。在古时候，许多大人物把这些白色的大蜗牛做成"碎肉"；当他们吃着的时候，就说："哼，味道真好！"因为他们认为蜗牛的味道很美。这些蜗牛都靠牛蒡叶子活着；因此人们才种植牛蒡。'>查看中文翻译</div>

They had never been outside it, but they knew that there was still something more in the world, which was called the manor-house, and that there they were boiled, and then they became black, and were then placed on a silver dish; but what happened further they knew not; or, in fact, what it was to be boiled, and to lie on a silver dish, they could not possibly imagine; but it was said to be delightful, and particularly genteel. Neither the chafers, the toads, nor the earth-worms, whom they asked about it could give them any information-none of them had been boiled or laid on a silver dish.</div>

<div class="line_en">And then the marriage was celebrated. Six earth-worms shone as well as they could. In other respects the whole went off very quietly, for the old folks could not bear noise and merriment; but old Dame Snail made a brilliant speech. Father Snail could not speak, he was too much affected; and so they gave them as a dowry and inheritance, the whole forest of burdocks, and said-what they had always said-that it was the best in the world; and if they lived honestly and decently, and increased and multiplied, they and their children would once in the course of time come to the manor-house, be boiled black, and laid on silver dishes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是它们就举行了婚礼。六个萤火虫尽量发出光来照着。除此以外，一切是非常安静的，因为这对老蜗牛夫妇不喜欢大喝大闹。不过蜗牛妈妈发表了一起动人的演说。蜗牛爸爸一句话也讲不出来，因为他受到了极大的感动。于是它们把整座牛蒡林送给这对年轻夫妇，作为遗产；并且说了一大套它们常常说的话，那就是——这地方是世界上最好的一块地方，如果它们要正直地，善良地生活和繁殖下去的话，它们和它们的孩子们将来就应该到那个公馆里去，以便被煮黑、放到银盘子上面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After this speech was made, the old ones crept into their shells, and never more came out. They slept; the young couple governed in the forest, and had a numerous progeny, but they were never boiled, and never came on the silver dishes; so from this they concluded that the manor-house had fallen to ruins, and that all the men in the world were extinct; and as no one contradicted them, so, of course it was so. And the rain beat on the dock-leaves to make drum-music for their sake, and the sun shone in order to give the burdock forest a color for their sakes; and they were very happy, and the whole family was happy; for they, indeed were so.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当这番演说讲完了以后，这对老夫妇就钻进它们的屋子里去，再也不出来。它们睡着了。年轻的蜗牛夫妇现在占有了这整座的森林，随后生了一大堆孩子。不过它们从来没有被烹调过，也没有到银盘子里去过。因此它们就下了一个结论，认为那个公馆已经塌了，全世界的人类都已经死去了。谁也没有反对它们这种看法，因此它们的看法一定是对的。雨打在牛蒡叶上，为它们发现咚咚的音乐来。太阳为它们发出亮光，使这牛蒡林增添了不少光彩。这样，它们过得非常幸福——这整个家庭是幸福的，说不出地幸福！">查看中文翻译</div>
