<div class="line_en">The human race continued to bask in the long, cloudless summer afternoon of peace and prosperity. Would there ever be a winter again? It was unthinkable. The age of reason, prematurely welcomed by the leaders of the French Revolution two and a half centuries before, had now really arrived. This time, there was no mistake.</div>

<div class="line_en">There were drawbacks, of course, though they were willingly accepted. One had to be very old indeed to realize that the papers which the telecaster printed in every home were really rather dull. Gone were the crises that had once produced banner headlines. There were no mysterious murders to baffle the police and to arouse in a million breasts the moral indignation that was often suppressed envy. Such murders as did occur were never mysterious: it was only necessary to turn a dial -- and the crime could be seen re-enacted. That instruments capable of such feats existed had at first caused considerable panic among quite law-abiding people. This was something that the Overlords, who had mastered most but not all the quirks of human psychology, had not anticipated. It had to be made perfectly clear that no Peeping Tom would be able to spy on his fellows, and that the very few instruments in human hands would be under strict control. Rupert Boyce's projector, for instance, could not operate beyond the borders of the reservation, so he and Maia were the only persons inside its range. Even the few serious crimes that did occur received no particular attention in the news. For well-bred people do not, after all, care to read about the social gaffes of others.</div>

<div class="line_en">The existence of so much leisure would have created tremendous problems a century before. Education had overcome most of these, for a well-stocked mind is safe from boredom. The general standard of culture was at a level which would once have seemed fantastic. There was no evidence that the intelligence of the human race had improved, but for the first time everyone was given the fullest opportunity of using what brains they had.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个世纪前，过多的闲暇时间会给人类带来很多的问题，而现在随着教育的进步，许多问题迎刃而解，一个充实的大脑不会感到无聊。人类总体文化水平达到了人类从不敢想象的高度，没有任何证据证明人类的智力提高了，但每个人第一次有了足够的机会去发挥自己的聪明才智。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Most people had two homes, in widely separated parts of the world. Now that the polar regions had been opened up, a considerable fraction of the human race oscillated from Arctic to Antarctic at six monthly intervals, seeking the long, nightless polar summer. Others had gone into the deserts, up the mountains, or even into the sea. There was nowhere on the planet where science and technology could not provide one with a comfortable home, if one wanted it badly enough. Some of the more eccentric dwelling-places provided the few items of excitement in the news. In the most perfectly ordered-society there will always be accidents. Perhaps it was a good sign that people felt it worthwhile to risk, and occasionally break, their necks for the sake of a cosy villa tucked under the summit of Everest, or looking out through the spray of Victoria Falls. As a result, someone was always being rescued from somewhere. It had become a kind of game -- almost a planetary sport.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="绝大多数人都有两个家，通常相距很远，极地也开发出来了，许多人半年住在北极，半年住在南极，始终追随着极地的永昼。还有些人住进了沙漠、深山里，甚至海底，不管身居何处，只要愿意，科技的力量都能为他们营造一个舒适的家。人们喜欢新闻报道里介绍的各类奇特住所。人们认为在世界最高峰珠穆朗玛峰下建一个温馨的家，或者住在维多利亚瀑布的山崖里，从里往外观看瀑布的飞流，是一件值得的事，就算折断脖子也无怨无悔。因此一个高度有序的社会仍然避免不了事故，总是有人在不同的地方被营救。冒险成了一种游戏，甚至可以说成了一项全球性的体育运动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The average working week was now about twenty hours -- but those twenty hours were no sinecure. There was little work left of a routine, mechanical nature. Men's minds were too valuable to waste on tasks that a few thousand transistors, some photoelectric cells, and a cubic metre of printed circuits could perform. There were factories that ran for weeks without being visited by a single human being. Men were needed for trouble-shooting, for making decisions, for planning new enterprises. The robots did the rest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="人们一周只工作二十个小时，但并不清闲。整个生产照既定程序自动进行着，人类真正需要做的事很少。人类的大脑不能浪费去做那些几千个晶体管、一些光电管、一个立方的打印系统就能干的事。有些工厂连续运行几个星期都没有一个人去看看。人们的工作只是排除故障做决定，策划新工厂等，其尔的一切都由机器人去干。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">People could indulge in such whims, because they had both the time and the money. The abolition of armed forces had at once almost doubled the world's effective wealth, and increased production had done the rest. As a result, it was difficult to compare the standard of living of twenty-first-century man with that of any of his predecessors. Everything was so cheap that the necessities of life were free, provided as a public service by the community as roads, water, street lighting and drainage had once been. A man could travel anywhere he pleased, eat whatever food he fancied -- without handing over any money. He had earned the right to do this by being a productive member of the community. There were, of course, some drones, but the number of people sufficiently strong-willed to indulge in a life of complete idleness is much smaller than is generally supposed. Supporting such parasites was considerably less of a burden than providing the armies of ticket-collectors, shop assistants, bank clerks, stockbrokers and so forth whose main function, when one took the global point of view, was to transfer items from one ledger to another.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="人们有时间也有钱，可以整天去做类似惊险刺激的事情。随着军队解除，世界的财富一下翻了一倍，生产发展进一步增加了财富，二十一世纪人类的生活水平是人类以往无法相比的。各种物品都很便宜，生活必需品更是和传统的道路、供水、路灯等公用设施一样完全免费。人们可以免费到自己想去的任何地方，吃喜欢的任何食物，作为人类的一员，他有这样的权利。虽然还有些懒汉，但真正无所事事的人少得可怜。从全球的角度看，养这些不干活的人比养大帮售票员、店员、银行职员、股票经纪人，以及其他把资金从一个账本转移到另一账本的人要省事得多。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Next to sport, entertainment, in all its branches, was the greatest single industry. For more than a hundred years there had been people who had believed that Hollywood was the centre of the world. They could now make a better case for this claim than ever before, but it was safe to say that most of 2050's productions would have seemed incomprehensibly highbrow to 1950. There had been some progress: the box-office was no longer lord of all it surveyed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="除了体育运动，娱乐行业也占了人们的许多时间和精力。娱乐是人类现存的惟一的大产业。好莱坞依然是世界娱乐的中心。2050年推出的电影在 1950年时根本无法想象，还有一大进步就是，票房不再是检验影片是否成功的唯一标准。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Among all the distractions and diversions of a planet which now seemed well on the way to becoming one vast playground, there were some who still found time to repeat an ancient and never-answered question: "Where do we go from here?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Nearly a quarter of the human race's total activity, it had been calculated, was now expended on sports of various kinds, ranging from such sedentary occupations as chess to lethal pursuits like ski-gliding across mountain valleys. One unexpected result of this was the extinction of the professional sportsmen. There were too many brilliant amateurs, and the changed economic conditions had made the old system obsolete.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="据统计，体育运动占了人类所有活动的四分之一，从下象棋这类安静的活动到踩着滑板往返山谷这样危险的游戏，应有尽有。最直接的后果就是专业运动员消失了。有了太多聪明的业余爱好者，又有了经济上的保障，旧的体制该淘汰了。">查看中文翻译</div>
