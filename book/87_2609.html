Paper clips and sticky notes scattered across the tan carpeting.</div>

<div class="line_en">Muttering darkly she hurried to the sink, feeling tense and angry with herself for not getting ready earlier. It was the case, the goddamn case.

<div class="line_en">When she'd first moved to Raccoon, she'd been under a lot of stress, feeling uncertain about the transfer, not even sure if she wanted to stay with the S. T. A. R. S. She was good at the job, but had only taken it because of Dick; after the indictment, he'd started to pressure her to get into another line of work. It had taken awhile, but her father was persis-tent, telling her again and again that one Valentine in jail was one too many, even admitting that he was wrong to raise her the way he had. With her training and background, there weren't a whole lot of options -- but the S. T. A. R. S., at least, appreciated her skills and didn't care how she came by them. The pay was decent, there was the element of risk she'd grown to enjoy… In retrospect, the career change had been surprisingly easy; it made Dick happy, and gave her the opportunity to see how the other half lived.</div>

<div class="line_en">The pup had been wandering through a garden only a few blocks away, no sweat and she'd made two new friends, as easy as that. The sisters had promptly adopted Jill, showing up after school to bring her scraggly bunches of flowers, playing in her yard on weekends, singing her endless songs they'd learned from movies and cartoons. It wasn't like the girls had miraculously changed her outlook or taken away her loneliness, but somehow her thoughts of leaving had been put on a back burner, left alone for awhile. For the first time in her twenty-three years, she'd started to feel like a part of the community she lived and worked in, the change so subtle and gradual that she'd hardly noticed.</div>

Jill drove through the wide suburban streets of her neighborhood, window down, pushing the speed limit but careful to watch for kids and pets. There weren't many of either around. Since the trouble had started, more and more people were keeping their children and animals indoors, even during the day.</div>

<div class="line_en">She rested her right hand on the ruffled sheaf, stilling the gentle movement and swore to herself that no matter what it took, she was going to find out who was responsible.

<div class="line_cn" title="“呀，福斯特，很有精神嘛。”克里斯从贩卖机中拿出罐装苏打水，顺势看了一眼自己的手表。距离会议召开还有几分钟的事件。当福斯特站在他的面前时，虽然克里斯的笑容中满是疲惫，但是那双蓝色的眼睛中仍然闪耀着光芒。福斯特的手中拿着很多装备——防弹马甲、多用途武装带、还有军用背包。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Chris turned away from the soda machine and saw Forest Speyer striding down the empty hall toward him, a wide grin on his tanned, boyish face.

He was also an excellent mechanic, and one of the best shots Chris had ever seen in action.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sighing inwardly, Chris slapped Forest's shoulder lightly and headed for ops through the doorway of the small upstairs waiting room and down the hall. He was surprised that Wesker was sending the teams in separately. Although it was standard for the less experienced S. T. A. R. S. to do the initial recon, this wasn't exactly a standard operation. The number of deaths they were dealing with alone was enough to call for a more aggressive offense. The fact that there were signs of organization to the murders should have brought it to A1 status, and Wesker was still treating it like some kind of a training run.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="内心发出了这样的疑问，克里斯轻轻的拍了下福斯特的肩膀，然后向着作战会议室走去。他惊讶于威斯克会将小队分批派遣出去，虽然对于缺少经验的S.T。A.R。S来说，开始进行预备调查是惯例，但这却不是通常的作战方式。即便从已经被发现的死者数量上来看，也应该准备更加积极的攻击力量才对。针对杀人犯而组成部队，这次的事件绝对是最高等级的。可是威斯克竟然只把这当成了一次训练活动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You know it." Forest pushed his hair back and grabbed his utility belt, obviously already focused on the mission. Chris thought about saying more, but decided against it. For all of his bravado, Forest was a professional; he didn't need to be told to be careful.</div>

He hadn't heard from Billy in awhile, but knew that he'd taken a research position with Umbrella, the pharmaceutical company that was the single biggest contributor to the economic prosperity of Raccoon City. Billy had never been the type to jump at shadows, and the terrified desperation in his voice had jolted Chris awake, filling him with deep concern. Billy had babbled that his life was in danger, that they were all in danger, begged Chris to meet him at a diner at the edge of town and then never showed up. No one had heard from him since.</div>

The cops had checked out Billy's apartment and found nothing to indicate foul play… but Chris's instincts told him that his friend was dead, and that he'd been killed by somebody who wanted to keep him from talking.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was Chris who answered, startling Barry. He'd walked back to join them, his youthful face fixed with a sudden intensity that almost bordered on obsessive.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="令巴瑞吃惊的是，克里斯回答了他的这一问题，不知不觉中他也加入到了对话中。那张年轻的脸上还带着不经意的紧张感。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Because it's the only place in the woods that hasn't been checked over by the police, and it's practically in the middle of the crime scenes. And because you can't always trust what people say."</div>

<div class="line_en">Whatever Chris was going to say in response was cut short by Wesker's smooth voice, rising from the front of the room. "All right, people. Since it appears that Ms. Valentine isn't planning on joining us, why don't we get this started?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然这话是对着克里斯说的，而同样在房同里听到众人谈话的威斯克用沉稳的声音打断了他，“好了，各位。如果大家都不介意我们的瓦伦蒂安小姐是否参加会议的话，那么我们是不是可以开始了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Barry walked to his desk, worried about Chris for the first time since this whole thing had started. He'd recruited the younger man for the S. T. A. R. S. a few years back thanks to a chance encounter in a local gun shop. Chris had proved to be an asset to the team, bright and thoughtful as well as a top-notch marksman and able pilot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="巴瑞回到了自己的桌前，自从这次的事件发生以来，他第一次开始担心克里斯。是巴瑞将克里斯弄进S.T。A.R。S的，这都是源于几年前二人在本地一家武器店的幸运邂逅。克里斯也证明了他对小队来说是极其重要的存在，头脑清晰、深谋远虑，同时还是一名神枪手，作为驾驶员他也有着一定的才能。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Barry gazed fondly at the picture of Kathy and the girls that sat on his desk. Chris's obsession with the murders in Raccoon was understandable, particularly since his friend had disappeared. Nobody in town wanted to see another life lost. Barry had a family, and was as determined as anyone else on the team to stop the killers. But Chris's relentless suspicion had gone a little overboard. What had he meant by that, "You can't always trust what people say"? Either that Umbrella was lying or Chief Irons was…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="巴瑞凝视着摆放在自己办公桌上的爱妻凯西以及女儿们的照片。虽然他不明白克里斯对发生在浣熊市一连串凶杀案所产生的强迫症的原因，但是他知道克里斯的朋友失踪了，城里的人都不希望再有新的生命消逝。自己也有家人。另外小队中的其他成员也都决心阻止杀人犯继续犯下罪行。而克里斯那种执着的疑问实在是有些过分，他到底想要说些什么，“经常信任别人，未必是件好事…”难道说安布雷拉和署长都在撒谎吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But now…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是，现在…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ridiculous. Umbrella's branch chemical plant and administrative buildings on the outskirts of town supplied three-quarters of the jobs in Raccoon City; it would be counter-productive for them to lie. Besides, Umbrella's integrity was at least as solid as any other major corporation's-maybe some industrial espionage, but medical secret-swapping was a far cry from murder. And Chief Irons, though a fat, weasely blow-hard, wasn't the kind to get his hands any dirtier than they'd get accepting illegal campaign funds; the guy wanted to be mayor, for chrissake.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个笨蛋。建在城市郊外的安市雷拉化学药品郜门的工厂以及总部大楼，可是为浣熊市提供了几乎半数以的就业机会。如果说谎的话，对他们来说只能起到反效果。而且安布雷拉的信誉至少也和其他大型公司处于同一水准——也许在暗地里会有几十商业间谍，但是医学上的秘密情报和连环杀人案之间可几乎扯不上什么关系。另外，艾隆斯署长的确有些骄傲自大，但他却不是一个会染指超出自己管辖范围的家伙。不管怎么说，他还想成为市长。市长啊，喂喂，你绕了我吧。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Barry's gaze lingered on the picture of his family a moment longer before he turned his chair around to face Wesker's desk, and he suddenly realized that he wanted Chris to be wrong.

<div class="line_cn" title="巴瑞转过椅子，面向威斯克的桌子，而视线好像还停留在家人的照片上。这时他忽然觉悟了，自己在心里隐隐地希望克里斯错了。如果说这次发生在浣熊市的一连串凶恶残虐的事件是事先就策划好的，那么也就是说…">查看中文翻译</div>
