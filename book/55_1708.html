<div class="line_en">The Age of Ideology that began in 1917 was an era in which the course of war was determined by the inevitabilist belief systems of the 19th-century counter-Enlightenment. A romantic, militarized nationalism inspired the expansionist programs of Fascist Italy and Imperial Japan, and with an additional dose of racialist pseudoscience, Nazi Germany. The leadership of each of these countries railed against the decadent individualism and universalism of the modern liberal West, and each was driven by the conviction that it was destined to rule over a natural domain: the Mediterranean, the Pacific rim, and the European continent, respectively. World War II began with invasions that were intended to move this destiny along. At the same time a romantic, militarized communism inspired the expansionist programs of the Soviet Union and China, who wanted to give a helping hand to the dialectical process by which the proletariat or peasantry would vanquish the bourgeoisie and establish a dictatorship in country after country. The Cold War was the product of the determination of the United States to contain this movement at something close to its boundaries at the end of World War II.</div>

<div class="line_en">The brain trust of the 19th- and early-20th-century antiwar movement included Quakers such as John Bright, abolitionists such as William Lloyd Garrison, advocates of the theory of gentle commerce such as John Stuart Mill and Richard Cobden, pacifist writers such as Leo Tolstoy, Victor Hugo, Mark Twain, and George Bernard Shaw, the philosopher Bertrand Russell, industrialists such as Andrew Carnegie and Alfred Nobel (of Peace Prize fame), many feminists, and the occasional socialist (motto: "A bayonet is a weapon with a worker at each end"). Some of these moral entrepreneurs created new institutions that were designed to preempt or constrain war, such as a court of international arbitration in The Hague and a series of Geneva Conventions on the conduct of war.</div>

<div class="line_en">But this narrative leaves out a major plot that perhaps had the most lasting impact on the 20th century. Mueller, Howard, Payne, and other political historians remind us that the 19th century was host to yet another movement: a continuation of the Enlightenment critique of war. Unlike the strain of liberalism that developed a soft spot for nationalism, this one kept its eye on the individual human being as the entity whose interests are paramount. And it invoked the Kantian principles of democracy, commerce, universal citizenship, and international law as practical means of implementing peace.</div>

<div class="line_en">Peace first became a popular sensation with the publication of two bestsellers. In 1889 the Austrian novelist Bertha von Suttner published a work of fiction called Die Waffen nieder! (Lay Down Your Arms!), a first-person account of the gruesomeness of war. And in 1909 the British journalist Norman Angell published a pamphlet called Europe's Optical Illusion, later expanded as The Great Illusion, which argued that war was economically futile. Plunder may have been profitable in primitive economies, when wealth lay in finite resources like gold or land or in the handiwork of self-sufficient craftsmen. But in a world in which wealth grows out of exchange, credit, and a division of labor, conquest cannot make a conqueror richer. Minerals don't just jump out of the ground, nor does grain harvest itself, so the conqueror would still have to pay the miners to mine and the farmers to farm. In fact, he would make himself poorer, since the conquest would cost money and lives and would damage the networks of trust and cooperation that allow everyone to enjoy gains in trade. Germany would have nothing to gain by conquering Canada any more than Manitoba would have something to gain by conquering Saskatchewan.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两本畅销书的出版让和平成为流行的主题。1889年，奥地利小说家贝尔塔·冯·苏特纳（Bertha von Suttner）的小说《放下武器！》（Die Waffen Nieder！），以第一人称讲述了战争的残酷。1909年，英国记者诺曼·安吉尔（Norman Angell）先是出版了一个小册子《欧洲的幻觉》（Europe’s Optical Illusion），后来扩展成书，书名“大幻影”（The Great Illusion），他在书中论证说战争是没有经济效益的。掠夺在原始经济中也许有利可图，因为财富的形态是有限的资源，比如黄金、土地或者自给自足的匠人的手工产品。但在一个财富来自交换、信用和分工的世界里，征服不可能让征服者更富有。矿产不会跳到地面上，庄稼不会走进粮仓，征服者还是要支付报酬，以使矿工采矿和农民春种秋收。事实上，征服者要付出金钱和生命，而且他破坏了人人受益的信任和合作系统，他只会变得更穷。不妨想象一下，加拿大中部省份马尼托巴征服西部省份萨斯喀彻温，能有多大的收益？如果说两个加拿大省份之间的征服收益有限，那德国征服加拿大，能得到的好处也绝不会更大。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For all its literary popularity, the antiwar movement seemed too idealistic at the time to be taken seriously by the political mainstream. Suttner was called "a gentle perfume of absurdity," and her German Peace Society "a comical sewing bee composed of sentimental aunts of both sexes." Angell's friends told him to "avoid that stuff or you'll be classed with cranks and faddists, with devotees of Higher Thought who go about in sandals and long beards, and live on nuts." H. G. Wells wrote that Shaw was "an elderly adolescent still at play… All through the war we shall have this Shavian accompaniment going on, like an idiot child screaming in a hospital." And though Angell had never claimed that war was obsolete -- he argued only that it served no economic purpose, and was terrified that glory-drunk leaders would blunder into it anyway -- that was how he was interpreted. After World War I he became a laughingstock, and to this day he remains a symbol for naïve optimism about the impending end of war. While I was writing this book, more than one concerned colleague took me aside to educate me about Norman Angell.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管文学作品一时间颇受欢迎，但反战运动在当时被认为过分理想化，没有任何政治势力愿意给予严肃的考虑。苏特纳被叫作“荒谬的温情香水”，她的德国和平学社是“一个滑稽的缝纫俱乐部，会员都是些感情脆弱的女大妈和男大妈”。安吉尔的朋友告诉他说：“不要再碰那些问题，否则你会和那些怪人，赶时髦的新潮儿，或者留着胡子穿着凉鞋追求高级思维、靠吃坚果维生的狂热分子划为一类。”H·G·威尔斯这样写道，萧伯纳是“一个还在玩耍的上了年纪的顽童…整个战争期间，我们一直听得见萧氏发出不和谐的伴奏，活像一个痴呆儿童在医院里大喊大叫”。事实上，安吉尔从来没有说战争是无用的，他仅仅是说，战争无法实现它的经济目的，他只是担心醉心荣耀的领导人会以此借口来发动战争——人们提到安吉尔，却总是说他认为战争是没有用处的。第一次世界大战结束后，安吉尔成为一个笑柄，因为他竟然认为能够终结战争。直到今天，他仍被看作天真乐观主义的象征。当我写作本书的时候，不止一位同事把我扯到一边，教育我诺曼·安吉尔是何许人也。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But according to Mueller, Angell deserves the last laugh. World War I put an end not just to romantic militarism in the Western mainstream but to the idea that war was in any way desirable or inevitable. "The First World War," notes Luard, "transformed traditional attitudes toward war. For the first time there was an almost universal sense that the deliberate launching of a war could now no longer be justified." It was not just that Europe was reeling from the loss of lives and resources. As Mueller notes, there had been comparably destructive wars in European history before, and in many cases countries dusted themselves off and, as if having learned nothing, promptly jumped into a new one. Recall that the statistics of deadly quarrels show no signature of war-weariness. Mueller argues that the crucial difference this time was that an articulate antiwar movement had been lurking in the background and could now say "I told you so."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，米勒认为，安吉尔是那个笑到最后的人。第一次世界大战不仅宣告了浪漫军国主义在西方主流思想界的终结，也否定了在任何情况下认为战争是一种需要，或者不可避免的观念。卢亚德说：“第一次世界大战改变了人们对于战争的传统态度。人类第一次有了一种几乎是普遍的认知，故意发动战争不再被认为是正当的。”这不仅是因为欧洲被生命和财产的巨大损失所震撼，正如米勒所说，欧洲历史上也曾经有过破坏性相当的战争，但在许多情况下，大部分参战国舔舔伤口、拍拍灰土，仿佛没有得到任何教训，立即跳进一场新的战争。还记得我们前面说过，致命争斗的统计显示不出有任何厌战情绪。米勒坚持认为，这一次则出现了关键性的区别，锲而不舍、旗帜鲜明的反战运动现在终于可以说：“我早就告诉过你们！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The change could be seen both in the political leadership and in the culture at large. When the destructiveness of the Great War became apparent, it was reframed as "the war to end all wars," and once it was over, world leaders tried to legislate the hope into reality by formally renouncing war and setting up a League of Nations to prevent it. However pathetic these measures may seem in hindsight, at the time they were a radical break from centuries in which war had been regarded as glorious, heroic, honorable, or in the famous words of the military theorist Karl von Clausewitz, "merely the continuation of policy by other means."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无论是政治家还是文化领域，都能看到这种转变。当人们目睹第一次世界大战的破坏性后，“伟大的战争”被改名为“结束一切战争的战争”。一旦战争结束，各国首脑们立即着手将希望付诸现实，宣布正式放弃战争，并筹组国联，防范新的战争。无论这些措施在事后来看是多么差劲，在当时，却是对几千年传统的颠覆。在此之前，人类一直将战争奉为光荣、英雄、名誉的等价物，用军事理论家卡尔·冯·克劳塞维茨的名言来说，战争“仅是政治以另外一种方式的继续”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">World War I has also been called the first "literary war." By the late 1920s, a genre of bitter reflections was making the tragedy and futility of the war common knowledge. Among the great works of the era are the poems and memoirs of Siegfried Sassoon, Robert Graves, and Wilfred Owen, the bestselling novel and popular film All Quiet on the Western Front, T. S. Eliot's poem "The Hollow Men," Hemingway's novel A Farewell to Arms, R. C. Sherriff's play Journey's End, King Vidor's film The Big Parade, and Jean Renoir's film Grand Illusion -- the title adapted from Angell's pamphlet. Like other humanizing works of art, these stories created an illusion of first-person immediacy, encouraging their audiences to empathize with the suffering of others. In an unforgettable scene from All Quiet on the Western Front, a young German soldier examines the body of a Frenchman he has just killed:</div>

<div class="line_en">The upshot of this literature, Mueller notes, was that war was no longer seen as glorious, heroic, holy, thrilling, manly, or cleansing. It was now immoral, repulsive, uncivilized, futile, stupid, wasteful, and cruel. And perhaps just as important, absurd. The immediate cause of World War I had been a showdown over honor. The leaders of Austria-Hungary had issued a humiliating ultimatum to Serbia demanding that it apologize for the assassination of the archduke and crack down on domestic nationalist movements to their satisfaction. Russia took offense on behalf of its fellow Slavs, Germany took offense at Russia's offense on behalf of its fellow German speakers, and as Britain and France joined in, a contest of face, humiliation, shame, stature, and credibility escalated out of control. A fear of being "reduced to a second-rate power" sent them hurtling toward each other in a dreadful game of chicken.</div>

<div class="line_en">The butt of the joke was different in the other classic war satire of the era, Charlie Chaplin's The Great Dictator (1940). It was no longer the hotheaded leaders of generic Ruritanian countries that were the target, since by now virtually everyone was allergic to a military culture of honor. Instead the buffoons were thinly disguised contemporary dictators who anachronistically embraced that ideal. In one memorable scene, the Hitler and Mussolini characters confer in a barbershop and each tries to dominate the other by raising his chair until both are bumping their heads against the ceiling.</div>

War has been likened to dueling, and recall that dueling was eventually laughed into extinction.

<div class="line_en">By the 1930s, according to Mueller, Europe's war aversion was prevalent even among the German populace and its military leadership. Though resentment of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles was high, few were willing to start a war of conquest to rectify them. Mueller ran through the set of German leaders who had any chance of becoming chancellor and argued that no one but Hitler showed any desire to subjugate Europe. Even a coup by the German military, according to the historian Henry Turner, would not have led to World War II. Hitler exploited the world's war-weariness, repeatedly professing his love of peace and knowing that no one was willing to stop him while he was still stoppable. Mueller reviews biographies of Hitler to defend the idea, also held by many historians, that one man was mostly responsible for the world's greatest cataclysm:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="米勒认为，到20世纪30年代，欧洲弥漫着浓重的厌战情绪，甚至德国平民和军官也不例外。虽然德国人对《凡尔赛条约》的条款非常不满，但几乎没有人愿意用发动战争来修正条约。米勒历数了一连串有机会成为总理的德国领导人，他们之中只有希特勒一个人怀有征服欧洲的野心。历史学家亨利·特纳说，只需要一次军事政变，就可以避免第二次世界大战。希特勒充分利用了世界的厌战情绪，一而再，再而三地宣称热爱和平，但他也深知，在还能够阻止他的野心的时候，是不会有人愿意出来阻拦他的。米勒和许多历史学家都认为，希特勒一个人要对这场人类历史上最可怕的灾难承担绝大部分的责任，米勒翻阅了希特勒的各种传记，为这一观点寻找证据：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After seizing control of the country in 1933, [Hitler] moved quickly and decisively to persuade, browbeat, dominate, outmaneuver, downgrade, and in many instances, murder opponents or would-be opponents. He possessed enormous energy and stamina, exceptional persuasive powers, an excellent memory, strong powers of concentration, an overwhelming craving for power, a fanatical belief in his mission, a monumental self-confidence, a unique daring, a spectacular facility for lying, a mesmerizing oratory style, and an ability to be utterly ruthless to anyone who got in his way or attempted to divert him from his intended course of action…</div>

<div class="line_en">Hitler needed the chaos and discontent to work with -- although he created much of it, too. And surely he needed assistance -- colleagues who were worshipfully subservient; a superb army that could be manipulated and whipped into action; a population capable of being mesmerized and led to slaughter; foreign opponents who were confused, disorganized, gullible, myopic, and faint-hearted; neighbors who would rather be prey than fight -- although he created much of this as well. Hitler took the conditions of the world as he found them and then shaped and manipulated them to his own ends.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="希特勒需要利用混乱和不满为自己寻找机会——尽管这些混乱和不满大多是他自己制造的。他还需要帮手——一些对他崇拜不已、俯首帖耳的奴才；需要一支能够听他使唤和调遣的军队；需要一个国家的国民能够为其所魅惑并被他带入屠宰场；还需要茫然、没有组织、愚蠢、短视、胆小如鼠的外国对手，以及情愿祈祷而不愿作战的邻国——可以说，他也是自己动手，制造了大部分他所需要的条件。希特勒将他得到的各种条件一一加以利用，根据自己的目的对世界进行操纵和重塑。">查看中文翻译</div>
