But before she was half way upstairs she heard the parlourdoor open, and, turning round, was astonished to see Edward himselfcome out.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I am going into the village to see my horses," said he, "as you arenot yet ready for breakfast; I shall be back again presently."</div>

<div class="line_en">Elinor saw, with great uneasiness the low spirits of her friend. Hisvisit afforded her but a very partial satisfaction, while his ownenjoyment in it appeared so imperfect. It was evident that he wasunhappy; she wished it were equally evident that he still distinguishedher by the same affection which once she had felt no doubt ofinspiring; but hitherto the continuance of his preference seemed veryuncertain; and the reservedness of his manner towards her contradictedone moment what a more animated look had intimated the preceding one.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃丽诺看到她的朋友闷闷不乐，心里大为不安。爱德华的来访给她带来了非常有限的一点欢快，而他自己似乎也不十分快乐。显而易见，他并不快活。她希望，他能同样显而易见地依然对她一往情深。她一度相信自己是能够激起他的这种深情的。可事到如今，他是不是仍然喜爱她，似乎非常捉摸不定。他刚才的眼神还是脉脉含情的，转瞬间却又采取了截然相反的态度，对她冷淡起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Edward returned to them with fresh admiration of the surroundingcountry; in his walk to the village, he had seen many parts of thevalley to advantage; and the village itself, in a much higher situationthan the cottage, afforded a general view of the whole, which hadexceedingly pleased him. This was a subject which ensured Marianne'sattention, and she was beginning to describe her own admiration ofthese scenes, and to question him more minutely on the objects that hadparticularly struck him, when Edward interrupted her by saying, "Youmust not enquire too far, Marianne-remember I have no knowledge in thepicturesque, and I shall offend you by my ignorance and want of tasteif we come to particulars. I shall call hills steep, which ought to bebold; surfaces strange and uncouth, which ought to be irregular andrugged; and distant objects out of sight, which ought only to beindistinct through the soft medium of a hazy atmosphere. You must besatisfied with such admiration as I can honestly give. I call it avery fine country-the hills are steep, the woods seem full of finetimber, and the valley looks comfortable and snug-with rich meadowsand several neat farm houses scattered here and there. It exactlyanswers my idea of a fine country, because it unites beauty withutility-and I dare say it is a picturesque one too, because you admireit; I can easily believe it to be full of rocks and promontories, greymoss and brush wood, but these are all lost on me. I know nothing ofthe picturesque."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱德华回来后，又对四周的景致重新赞赏了一番。他往庄上走时，山谷很多地方给他留下了美好的印象。村庄本身所处的地段比乡舍高得多，周围的景色可以一览无余，使他为之心醉神迷。这是个玛丽安肯定感兴趣的话题阿那克西米尼（Anaximenes，约前588—约前525）又译，她开始叙说她自己对这些景色如何赞赏，同时详细询问哪些景物给他的印象最深。不料爱德华打断了她的话，说：“你不要细问，玛丽安——别忘记，我对风景一窍不通，要是谈得太具体了，我的无知和缺乏审美力一定会引起你们的反感。本来是险峻的山岭，我却称之为陡峭的山岭，本来是崎岖不平的地面，我却称之为奇形怪状的地面；在柔和的雾蔼中，有些远景本来只是有些隐约不清，我却一概视而不见。不过，对于我的诚挚赞赏，你一定会感到满意的。我说这地方非常优美——山高坡陡，佳木成林，峡谷幽邃，景色宜人——丰美的草地，零零散散地点缀着几幢整洁的农舍。这正是我心目中的美景，因为它将优美和实用融为一体——这里大概还称得上是风景如画吧，因为连你也称赞它。不难相信，这里一定是怪石嶙峋，岬角密布，灰苔遍地，灌木丛生，不过这一切我概不欣赏。我对风景一窍不通。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I suspect," said Elinor, "that to avoid one kind of affectation, Edward here falls into another. Because he believes many peoplepretend to more admiration of the beauties of nature than they reallyfeel, and is disgusted with such pretensions, he affects greaterindifference and less discrimination in viewing them himself than hepossesses. He is fastidious and will have an affectation of his own."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我怀疑，”埃丽诺说，“爱德华为了避免一种形式的装模作样，结果陷入了另一种形式的装模作样。他认为，许多人喜欢虚情假意地赞赏大自然的美丽，不禁对这种装模作样产生了恶感，于是便假装对自然景色毫无兴趣，毫无鉴赏力。他是个爱挑剔的人，要有自己的装模作样。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I am convinced," said Edward, "that you really feel all the delight ina fine prospect which you profess to feel. But, in return, your sistermust allow me to feel no more than I profess. I like a fine prospect, but not on picturesque principles. I do not like crooked, twisted, blasted trees. I admire them much more if they are tall, straight, andflourishing. I do not like ruined, tattered cottages. I am not fondof nettles or thistles, or heath blossoms. I have more pleasure in asnug farm-house than a watch-tower-and a troop of tidy, happy villagesplease me better than the finest banditti in the world."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你自称喜欢美丽的景色，”爱德华说，“我相信这是你的真实感觉。然而，反过来，你姐姐必须允许我只具有我所声称的那种感受。我喜爱美丽的景色，但不是基于风景如画的原则。我不喜欢弯弯扭扭、枯萎干瘪的老树。它们要是高大挺拔、枝繁叶茂，我就更赞赏它们了。我不喜欢坍塌破败的乡舍，不喜欢荨麻、蓟花、石南花。我宁愿住在一座舒舒适适的农舍里，也不愿住在一间岗楼上——而即使天下最潇洒的歹徒也没有一伙整洁、快活的村民使我更喜爱。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It is very true," said Marianne, "that admiration of landscape sceneryis become a mere jargon. Every body pretends to feel and tries todescribe with the taste and elegance of him who first defined whatpicturesque beauty was. I detest jargon of every kind, and sometimes Ihave kept my feelings to myself, because I could find no language todescribe them in but what was worn and hackneyed out of all sense andmeaning."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“一点不错，”玛丽安说，“赞赏风景成了仅仅是讲些行话。人人都装作和第一个给风景优美下定义的人一样，无论是感受起来还是描绘起来，都情趣盎然百科全书派广义指18世纪法国参加狄德罗主编的《百科，雅致不凡。我讨厌任何一种行话，有时候我把自己的感受闷在心里，因为除了那些毫无意义的陈词滥调之外，我找不到别的语言来形容。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The subject was continued no farther; and Marianne remainedthoughtfully silent, till a new object suddenly engaged her attention. She was sitting by Edward, and in taking his tea from Mrs. Dashwood, his hand passed so directly before her, as to make a ring, with a plaitof hair in the centre, very conspicuous on one of his fingers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个话题没有继续谈论下去。玛丽安默默沉思着，直至一个新玩意儿突然攫住了她的注意力。她就坐在爱德华旁边，当爱德华伸手去接达什伍德太太递来的茶时，他的手恰好从她眼前伸过，只见他一根指头上戴着一只惹人注目的戒指《三国志—吴书—张温传》：“豔性狷厲，好为清议，见时郎署，中间还夹着一绺头发。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Elinor had met his eye, and looked conscious likewise. That the hairwas her own, she instantaneously felt as well satisfied as Marianne; the only difference in their conclusions was, that what Marianneconsidered as a free gift from her sister, Elinor was conscious musthave been procured by some theft or contrivance unknown to herself. She was not in a humour, however, to regard it as an affront, andaffecting to take no notice of what passed, by instantly talking ofsomething else, she internally resolved henceforward to catch everyopportunity of eyeing the hair and of satisfying herself, beyond alldoubt, that it was exactly the shade of her own.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃丽诺刚才触到了他的目光，同样显得很尴尬。霎时间，她和玛丽安都感到十分得意，因为这头发就是她埃丽诺的。她们的结论的唯一区别在于：玛丽安认为这是姐姐慷慨赠送的，而埃丽诺却意识到著作，这一定是爱德华暗中耍弄什么诡计，偷偷摸摸搞到手的。不过，她无心把这看成一种冒犯，只管装作毫不介意的样子，立即转换了话题。但她暗中却下定决心，要抓住一切机会仔细瞧瞧，以便确信那绺头发和她的头发完全是一个颜色。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I never saw you wear a ring before, Edward," she cried. "Is thatFanny's hair? I remember her promising to give you some. But I shouldhave thought her hair had been darker."</div>

<div class="line_en">Marianne spoke inconsiderately what she really felt-but when she sawhow much she had pained Edward, her own vexation at her want of thoughtcould not be surpassed by his. He coloured very deeply, and giving amomentary glance at Elinor, replied, "Yes; it is my sister's hair. Thesetting always casts a different shade on it, you know."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽安无所顾忌地说出了心里话——可是，当她发现爱德华给她搞得不胜难堪时，她又对自己缺少心眼感到恼火，简直比爱德华还恼火。爱德华满脸涨得通红，不由得瞥了埃丽诺一眼，然后答道：“是的，是我姐姐的头发。你知道，由于戒指框子的投光，头发颜色的浓淡程度看起来总有变化。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Before the middle of the day, they were visited by Sir John and Mrs. Jennings, who, having heard of the arrival of a gentleman at thecottage, came to take a survey of the guest. With the assistance ofhis mother-in-law, Sir John was not long in discovering that the nameof Ferrars began with an F. and this prepared a future mine of railleryagainst the devoted Elinor, which nothing but the newness of theiracquaintance with Edward could have prevented from being immediatelysprung.
