<div class="line_en">Tom appeared on the sidewalk with a bucket of whitewash and a long–handled brush. He surveyed the fence, and all gladness left him and a deep melancholy settled down upon his spirit. Thirty yards of board fence nine feet high. Life to him seemed hollow, and existence but a burden. Sighing, he dipped his brush and passed it along the topmost plank; repeated the operation; did it again; compared the insignificant whitewashed streak with the far–reaching continent of unwhitewashed fence, and sat down on a tree–box discouraged. Jim came skipping out at the gate with a tin pail, and singing Buffalo Gals. Bringing water from the town pump had always been hateful work in Tom's eyes, before, but now it did not strike him so. He remembered that there was company at the pump. White, mulatto, and negro boys and girls were always there waiting their turns, resting, trading playthings, quarrelling, fighting, skylarking. And he remembered that although the pump was only a hundred and fifty yards off, Jim never got back with a bucket of water under an hour-and even then somebody generally had to go after him. Tom said:</div>

<div class="line_en">Saturday morning was come, and all the summer world was bright and fresh, and brimming with life. There was a song in every heart; and if the heart was young the music issued at the lips. There was cheer in every face and a spring in every step. The locust–trees were in bloom and the fragrance of the blossoms filled the air. Cardiff Hill, beyond the village and above it, was green with vegetation and it lay just far enough away to seem a Delectable Land, dreamy, reposeful, and inviting.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jim was only human-this attraction was too much for him. He put down his pail, took the white alley, and bent over the toe with absorbing interest while the bandage was being unwound. In another moment he was flying down the street with his pail and a tingling rear, Tom was whitewashing with vigor, and Aunt Polly was retiring from the field with a slipper in her hand and triumph in her eye.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉姆到底是个凡人，不是神仙——这诱惑对他太大了。他放下水桶，接过白石头子儿，还饶有兴趣地弯着腰看汤姆解开缠在脚上的布带子，看那只肿痛的脚趾。可是，一会儿之后，吉姆的屁股直痛，拎着水桶飞快地沿着街道跑掉了；汤姆继续用劲地刷墙，因为波莉姨妈此时从田地干活回来了。她手里提着一只拖鞋，眼里流露出满意的神色。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But Tom's energy did not last. He began to think of the fun he had planned for this day, and his sorrows multiplied. Soon the free boys would come tripping along on all sorts of delicious expeditions, and they would make a world of fun of him for having to work-the very thought of it burnt him like fire. He got out his worldly wealth and examined it-bits of toys, marbles, and trash; enough to buy an exchange of WORK, maybe, but not half enough to buy so much as half an hour of pure freedom. So he returned his straitened means to his pocket, and gave up the idea of trying to buy the boys. At this dark and hopeless moment an inspiration burst upon him! Nothing less than a great, magnificent inspiration.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，汤姆这股劲没持续多久。他开始想起原先为这个休息日所作的一些玩耍的安排，心里越想越不是滋味。再过一会儿，那些自由自在的孩子们就会蹦跳着跑过来，做各种各样开心好玩的游戏，他们看到他不得不刷墙干活，会大肆嘲笑挖苦他的——一想到这，汤姆心里就像火烧似的难受。他拿出他全部的家当宝贝，仔细地看了一阵——有残缺不全的玩具、一些石头子、还有一些没有什么用处的东西。这些玩意足够用来换取别的孩子为自己干活，不过，要想换来半个小时的绝对自由，也许还差得远呢。于是他又把这几件可怜的宝贝玩意装进口袋，打消了用这些来收买那些男孩子的念头。正在这灰心绝望的时刻，他忽然灵机一动，计上心来。这主意实在是聪明绝伦，妙不可言。">查看中文翻译</div>

Ben's gait was the hop–skip–and–jump-proof enough that his heart was light and his anticipations high. He was eating an apple, and giving a long, melodious whoop, at intervals, followed by a deep–toned ding–dong–dong, ding–dong–dong, for he was personating a steamboat. As he drew near, he slackened speed, took the middle of the street, leaned far over to starboard and rounded to ponderously and with laborious pomp and circumstance-for he was personating the Big Missouri, and considered himself to be drawing nine feet of water. He was boat and captain and engine–bells combined, so he had to imagine himself standing on his own hurricane–deck giving the orders and executing them:</div>

And while the late steamer Big Missouri worked and sweated in the sun, the retired artist sat on a barrel in the shade close by, dangled his legs, munched his apple, and planned the slaughter of more innocents. There was no lack of material; boys happened along every little while; they came to jeer, but remained to whitewash. By the time Ben was fagged out, Tom had traded the next chance to Billy Fisher for a kite, in good repair; and when he played out, Johnny Miller bought in for a dead rat and a string to swing it with-and so on, and so on, hour after hour. And when the middle of the afternoon came, from being a poor poverty–stricken boy in the morning, Tom was literally rolling in wealth. He had besides the things before mentioned, twelve marbles, part of a jews–harp, a piece of blue bottle–glass to look through, a spool cannon, a key that wouldn't unlock anything, a fragment of chalk, a glass stopper of a decanter, a tin soldier, a couple of tadpoles, six fire–crackers, a kitten with only one eye, a brass doorknob, a dog–collar-but no dog-the handle of a knife, four pieces of orange–peel, and a dilapidated old window sash.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tom said to himself that it was not such a hollow world, after all. He had discovered a great law of human action, without knowing it-namely, that in order to make a man or a boy covet a thing, it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to attain. If he had been a great and wise philosopher, like the writer of this book, he would now have comprehended that Work consists of whatever a body is OBLIGED to do, and that Play consists of whatever a body is not obliged to do. And this would help him to understand why constructing artificial flowers or performing on a tread–mill is work, while rolling ten–pins or climbing Mont Blanc is only amusement. There are wealthy gentlemen in England who drive four–horse passenger–coaches twenty or thirty miles on a daily line, in the summer, because the privilege costs them considerable money; but if they were offered wages for the service, that would turn it into work and then they would resign.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汤姆自言自语道，这世界原来并不是那么空洞乏味啊。他已经不知不觉地发现了人类行为的一大法则——那就是为了让一个大人或一个小孩渴望干什么事，只需设法将这事变得难以到手就行了。如果他是位伟大而明智的哲学家，就像这本书的作者，他就会懂得所谓“工作”就是一个人被迫要干的事情，至于“玩”就是一个人没有义务要干的事。这个道理使他明白了为什么做假花和蹬车轮就算是工作，而玩十柱戏和爬勃朗峰就算是娱乐。英国有钱的绅士在夏季每天驾着四轮马拉客车沿着同样的路线走上二三十里，他们为这种特权竟花了很多钱。可是如果因此付钱给他们的话，那就把这桩事情变成了工作，他们就会撒手不干了。">查看中文翻译</div>
