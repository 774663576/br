<div class="line_en">Winter turns to spring and Parvaneh passes her driving test. Ove teaches Adrian how to change tires. The kid may have bought a Toyota, but that doesn't mean he's entirely beyond help, Ove explains to Sonja when he visits her one Sunday in April. Then he shows her some photographs of Parvaneh's little boy. Four months old and as fat as a seal pup. Patrick has tried to force one of those cell phone camera things on Ove, but he doesn't trust them. So he walks around with a thick wad of paper copies inside his wallet instead, held together by a rubber band. Shows everyone he meets. Even the people who work at the florist's.</div>

<div class="line_en">Even more houses are built in the area. In a few years it goes from a quiet backwater to a city district. Which obviously doesn't make Patrick more competent when it comes to opening windows or assembling IKEA wardrobes. One morning he turns up at Ove's door with two men more or less the same age as himself, who apparently are also not so good at it. Both own houses a few streets down, they explain. They're restoring them but they've run into problems with joists over partition walls. They don't know what to do. But Ove knows, of course. He mutters something that sounds a little like "fools" and goes over to show them. The next day another neighbor turns up. And then another. And then another. Within a few months Ove has been everywhere, fixing this and that in almost every house within a radius of four streets. Obviously he always grumbles about people's incompetence. But when he's by himself by Sonja's grave he does mumble on one occasion, "Sometimes it can be quite nice having something to get on with in the daytime."</div>

<div class="line_en">Mirsad wears a black suit and is literally shaking with nervousness. Parvaneh has to give him a shot of tequila before he goes into the Town Hall. Jimmy is waiting inside. Ove is his best man. Has bought a new suit. They have the party at Amel's café; the stocky man tries to hold a speech three times but he's too overwhelmed by emotion to manage more than a few stuttering words. On the other hand, he names a sandwich after Jimmy, and Jimmy himself says it's the most magnificent present he's ever had. He continues living in his mother's house with Mirsad. The following year they adopt a little girl. Jimmy brings her along to Anita and Rune's every afternoon, without fail, at three o'clock when they have coffee.</div>

<div class="line_en">Parvaneh's daughters celebrate their birthdays and before anyone can explain how it happened, the three-year-old has become a six-year-old, in that disrespectful way often noted in three-year-olds. Ove goes with her to school on her first day. She teaches him to insert smileys into a text message, and he makes her promise never to tell Patrick that he's got himself a cell phone. The eight-year-old, who in a similar disrespectful way has now turned ten, holds her first pajama party. Their little brother disperses his toys all over Ove's kitchen. Ove builds a splash pond for him in his outside space but when someone calls it a splash pond Ove snorts that "Actually it's a bloody pool, isn't it!" Anders is voted in again as the chairman of the Residents' Association. Parvaneh buys a new lawn mower for the lawn behind the houses.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ove looks like he's sleeping very deeply. She has never seen his face looking so peaceful. The cat lies at his side with its little head carefully resting in the palm of his hand. When it sees Parvaneh it slowly, slowly stands up, as if only then fully accepting what has happened, then climbs into her lap. They sit together on the bedside and Parvaneh caresses the thin locks of hair on Ove's head until the ambulance crew gets there and, with tender and gentle words and movements, explains that they have to take the body away. Then she leans forward and whispers, "Give my love to Sonja and thank her for the loan," into his ear. Then she takes the big envelope from the bedside table on which is written, in longhand, "To Parvaneh," and goes back down the stairs.</div>

Her eyes are swollen with tears; her throat is so dry that she has felt as if she's panting for air for several days now. The sight of the candles eases something in her breathing.

<div class="line_en">In the evening she shows a young, recently married couple around Ove and Sonja's house. The woman is pregnant. Her eyes glitter as she walks through the rooms, the way eyes glitter when a person imagines her child's future memories unfolding there on the floor. Her husband is obviously much less pleased with the place. He's wearing a pair of carpenter's trousers and he mostly goes around kicking the baseboards suspiciously and looking annoyed. Parvaneh obviously knows it doesn't make any difference; she can see in the girl's eyes that the decision has already been made. But when the young man asks in a sullen tone about "that garage place" mentioned in the ad, Parvaneh looks him up and down carefully, nods drily, and asks what car he drives. The young man straightens up for the first time, smiles an almost undetectable smile, and looks her right in the eye with the sort of indomitable pride that only one word can convey.</div>
