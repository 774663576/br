<div class="line_en">After a while Haw made his way back to Cheese Station C and found Hem. He offered Hem bits of New Cheese, but was turned down.</div>

<div class="line_en">As he retraced his steps, he stopped and wrote on the wall:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在返回的路上，他停下来，在墙上写道：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was happy when he wasn't being run by his fear. He liked what he was doing now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他高兴的是，他不再受自己的恐惧感的驱使。他喜欢自己正在做的事情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hem appreciated his friend's gesture but said, "I don't think I would like New Cheese. It's not what I'm used to. I want my own Cheese back and I'm not going to change until I get what I want."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哼哼很感激朋友的心意，但是他说：“我不喜欢新奶酪，这不是我习惯吃的那一种。我只要我自己的奶酪回来。除非可以得到我想要的东西，否则我是不会改变主意的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="越早放弃旧的奶酪，你就会越早发现新的奶酪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Haw just shook his head in disappointment and reluctantly went back out on his own. As he returned to the farthest point he had reached in the maze, he missed his friend, but realized he liked what he was discovering. Even before he found what he hoped would be a great supply of New Cheese, if ever, he knew that what made him happy wasn't just having Cheese.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="唧唧失望地摇了摇头，不情愿地一个人踏上了自己的旅程。当走到他到达过的迷宫最深处时，他怀念起他的朋友来，但他明白，他喜欢的还是他的探险过程。虽然以前他想自己希望的是得到充足的新奶酪，但现在他清楚使自己快乐的并不仅仅是奶酪而已。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Know this, Haw didn't feel as weak as he did when he stayed in Cheese Station C with no Cheese. Just realized he was not letting his fear stop him and knowing that he had taken a new direction nourished him and gave him strength.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="明白了这一点，唧唧不再像在奶酪C站时，在没有奶酪的日子里感到那样虚弱了。他知道，他不会再让恐惧感阻碍自己。他选择了一个新的方向，他的身心得到了滋养，体力得到加强。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He smiled as he realized:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他认识到这一点的时候，他不禁微笑起来，并在墙上写道：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now he felt that it was just a question of time before he found what he needed. In fact, he sensed he had already found what he was looking for.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在，他觉得，找到自己想要的东西只是一个时间问题。事实上，他感到他已经找到了他一直在寻找的东西。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Haw realized again, as he had once before, that what you are afraid of is never as bad as what you imagine. The fear you let build up in your mind is worse than the situation that actually exists.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="唧唧还认识到，就像他曾经体会过的那样，你所害怕的东西根本没有你想像的那样糟糕，在你心里形成的恐惧比你的实际处境要更坏。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He'd been so afraid of never finding New Cheese that he didn't even want to start looking. But since his journey he had enough Cheese in the corridors to keep him going. Now he looked forward to finding more. Just looking ahead was becoming exciting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他曾经是如此害怕找不到新的奶酪，以致于他根本不想开始去寻找。然而一旦开始寻找的旅程，他就发现迷宫的走廊中有足够的奶酪使他继续找下去。现在，他期待着找到更多的奶酪。只要朝前看，他就会因为有所期待而兴奋起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His old thinking had been clouded by his worries and fears. He used to think about not having enough Cheese, or not having it last as long as he wanted. He used to think more about what could go wrong than what could go right.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他过时的思想被恐惧和忧虑蒙蔽了。过去考虑的总是没有奶酪，或者没有可以维持足够长时间的奶酪。以前总是觉得会把事情做错，而不是考虑把事情做好。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He used to believe that Cheese should never be moved and that change wasn't right.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过去他习惯于认为，奶酪绝不会被拿走，改变总是不对的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Haw knew he would be in better shape now if he had embraced the change much sooner and left Cheese Station C earlier. He would feel stronger in body and spirit and he could have coped better with the challenge of finding New Cheese. In fact, he probably would have found it by now if he had expected change, rather than wasting time denying that the change had already taken place.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="唧唧知道，如果他能够早一些离开奶酪C站，早一点应对这些变化，他现在的状况就会更好一些。他的身体会更强壮，精神也会更坚强，会更好地去迎接挑战——寻找新奶酪的挑战。事实上，如果他不是浪费时间，否认已经发生了的变化，如果他能够期待改变，也许他已经找到奶酪了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It all depends on what you choose to believe.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些都取决于你选择相信什么。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Haw hadn't found any Cheese yet but, as he ran through the maze, he thought about what he had already learned.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="唧唧还没有找到奶酪，但在迷宫中穿行的时候，唧唧在想自己从中学到了什么。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now he realized it was natural for change to continually occur, whether you expect it or not. Change could surprise you only if you didn't expect it and weren't looking for it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在，他知道，变化会不断地发生，这是很自然的事情，不管你是否希望如此。只有当你不希望变化，也不想追寻变化的时候，变化才会让你感到吃惊。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As he thought back on where he had come from, Haw was glad he had written on the wall in many places. He trusted it would serve as a marked trail for Hem to follow through the maze, if he choose to leave Cheese Station C.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他回顾自己是怎么走过来的时候，他很高兴他在很多经过的地放的墙上都留下了字迹。他相信如果哼哼决定离开奶酪C站的话，这就是留给哼哼的路标，能帮助哼哼穿过迷宫。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他继续以更充沛的体力和更快的速度穿越迷宫。不久，期待已久的事情终于发生了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He gathered his will and decided to keep proceeding into the newer parts of the maze. He found little bits of Cheese here and there and began to regain his strength and confidence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他再一次运用自己的想像力，看见自己正在发现和品尝新奶酪。他决定到更多的地方去，去迷宫中那些他还没有到过的地方。在这些地方，他偶尔找到一些小块的奶酪。唧唧又开始恢复了体力和信心。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He wrote on the wall what he had been thinking about for some time:</div>
