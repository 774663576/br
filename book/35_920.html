<div class="line_en">You would have searched a long time for the sort of winding lane or tranquil meadow for which England later became celebrated. There were instead miles of desolate, uncultivated land; here and there rough-hewn paths over craggy hills or bleak moorland. Most of the roads left by the Romans would by then have become broken or overgrown, often fading into wilderness. Icy fogs hung over rivers and marshes, serving all too well the ogres that were then still native to this land. The people who lived nearby -- one wonders what desperation led them to settle in such gloomy spots -- might well have feared these creatures, whose panting breaths could be heard long before their deformed figures emerged from the mist. But such monsters were not cause for astonishment. People then would have regarded them as everyday hazards, and in those days there was so much else to worry about. How to get food out of the hard ground; how not to run out of firewood; how to stop the sickness that could kill a dozen pigs in a single day and produce green rashes on the cheeks of children.</div>

<div class="line_en">In any case, ogres were not so bad provided one did not provoke them. One had to accept that every so often, perhaps following some obscure dispute in their ranks, a creature would come blundering into a village in a terrible rage, and despite shouts and brandishings of weapons, rampage about injuring anyone slow to move out of its path. Or that every so often, an ogre might carry off a child into the mist. The people of the day had to be philosophical about such outrages.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="反正食人兽不算太坏，只要别去激怒它们。不过事实还是必须接受：不时会有一个家伙，或许是和同类发生了争执，跌跌撞撞闯进某个村庄，发着可怕的怒火，人们叫喊着，挥舞着武器，但它全不理会，横冲直闯，躲闪不及的都要受伤。或者，不时会有食人兽把某个孩子抓到迷雾里。对于这种灾害，当时的人们只好看得超脱一点。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In one such area on the edge of a vast bog, in the shadow of some jagged hills, lived an elderly couple, Axl and Beatrice. Perhaps these were not their exact or full names, but for ease, this is how we will refer to them. I would say this couple lived an isolated life, but in those days few were "isolated" in any sense we would understand. For warmth and protection, the villagers lived in shelters, many of them dug deep into the hillside, connecting one to the other by underground passages and covered corridors. Our elderly couple lived within one such sprawling warren --"building" would be too grand a word -- with roughly sixty other villagers. If you came out of their warren and walked for twenty minutes around the hill, you would have reached the next settlement, and to your eyes, this one would have seemed identical to the first. But to the inhabitants themselves, there would have been many distinguishing details of which they would have been proud or ashamed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在一片大沼泽附近，就有这么一块地方，坐落在嶙峋的山峦投下的阴影之中。这儿住着一对年老的夫妇，男的叫埃克索，女的叫比特丽丝。也许这不是他们准确的名字，也不是全名，但为了方便起见，我们就这么称呼他们吧。我本来想说，这对夫妇过着“孤独”的生活，但根据我们对这个词的理解，那时候没有人是“孤独”的。为了取暖和安全，村民们生活在室内，住的地方多从山腰挖进去，深入山腹，有地下通道和走廊相互连通。我们这对老夫妇，就生活在这样一个大巢穴里，算不上是“建筑”吧，和大约六十位村民住在一起。如果你离开他们的巢穴，沿着山脚走二十分钟，应该就会看到第二个村庄，在你眼里，和第一个没什么不同。但对村民自己来说，肯定有很多细微的差别，有的让他们骄傲，有的让他们羞愧。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I have no wish to give the impression that this was all there was to the Britain of those days; that at a time when magnificent civilisations flourished elsewhere in the world, we were here not much beyond the Iron Age. Had you been able to roam the countryside at will, you might well have discovered castles containing music, fine food, athletic excellence; or monasteries with inhabitants steeped in learning. But there is no getting around it. Even on a strong horse, in good weather, you could have ridden for days without spotting any castle or monastery looming out of the greenery. Mostly you would have found communities like the one I have just described, and unless you had with you gifts of food or clothing, or were ferociously armed, you would not have been sure of a welcome. I am sorry to paint such a picture of our country at that time, but there you are.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我无意让人觉得，那时候的英国就只有这些东西，以为当辉煌的文明在世界其他地方蓬勃发展之时，我们这儿的人还刚刚走出铁器时代。假使你能够在乡间漫游，定会遇到有音乐、美食和高超竞技技巧的城堡，或者有饱学之士的修道院。问题是没法到处旅行。就算有一匹强健的马，天气晴好，一连走上好几天，你也可能看不到绿林中露出城堡或修道院来。你碰到的很可能都是我刚刚描述过的这种村落；而且，除非随身携带食品或衣物作为礼品，或配备令人生畏的武器，否则未必会受到欢迎。很遗憾我描绘了当时我们国家的这么一幅景象，但事实就是这样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">To return to Axl and Beatrice. As I said, this elderly couple lived on the outer fringes of the warren, where their shelter was less protected from the elements and hardly benefited from the fire in the Great Chamber where everyone congregated at night. Perhaps there had been a time when they had lived closer to the fire; a time when they had lived with their children. In fact, it was just such an idea that would drift into Axl's mind as he lay in his bed during the empty hours before dawn, his wife soundly asleep beside him, and then a sense of some unnamed loss would gnaw at his heart, preventing him from returning to sleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="回头说说埃克索和比特丽丝吧。我说过，这对年老的夫妇住在巢穴的外围，住所受自然的侵袭较多，大家晚上聚集的“大室”中烧着火堆，但他们几乎享受不到。以前某个时候，他们也许曾住在火堆附近——和孩子们住在一起的时候。实际上，浮现在埃克索脑海中的正是这个念头。这是黎明前那段空寂的时光，他躺在床上，妻子在身旁酣睡，一种莫名的失落感噬咬着他的心，让他无法再次入睡。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Perhaps that was why, on this particular morning, Axl had abandoned his bed altogether and slipped quietly outside to sit on the old warped bench beside the entrance to the warren in wait for the first signs of daylight. It was spring, but the air still felt bitter, even with Beatrice's cloak, which he had taken on his way out and wrapped around himself. Yet he had become so absorbed in his thoughts that by the time he realised how cold he was, the stars had all but gone, a glow was spreading on the horizon, and the first notes of birdsong were emerging from the dimness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="也许，正是因为这个原因，这天夜里，埃克索干脆下了床，悄悄溜到屋外，在巢穴入口旁那条破旧的板凳上坐下，等候着晨曦的来临。这时候是春天，但空气仍然刺骨，虽然埃克索出来的时候，随手拿起了比特丽丝的斗篷披在身上。不过，他一直沉浸在思绪之中，等他意识到冷的时候，天上几乎都没了星星，一片亮光从地平线上蔓延开来，昏暗中传来第一声鸟鸣。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He rose slowly to his feet, regretting having stayed out so long. He was in good health, but it had taken a while to shake off his last fever and he did not wish it to return. Now he could feel the damp in his legs, but as he turned to go back inside, he was well satisfied: for he had this morning succeeded in remembering a number of things that had eluded him for some time. Moreover, he now sensed he was about to come to some momentous decision -- one that had been put off far too long -- and felt an excitement within him which he was eager to share with his wife.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他缓缓站起身，心里后悔在外面待得太久。他身体健康，但上次发烧花了挺长时间才恢复，他可不想又发起热来。现在他能感受到腿部的湿气，不过转身进屋的时候，他感觉很满足：因为几件在记忆中躲藏了许久的事情，今天早晨他终于想起来了。而且，他现在觉得某个重大决定快要在他脑中成形了，一个推迟了太久的决定，所以心里颇为兴奋，急着要与妻子分享。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Inside, the passageways of the warren were still in complete darkness, and he was obliged to feel his way the short distance back to the door of his chamber. Many of the "doorways" within the warren were simple archways to mark the threshold to a chamber. The open nature of this arrangement would not have struck the villagers as compromising their privacy, but allowed rooms to benefit from any warmth coming down the corridors from the great fire or the smaller fires permitted within the warren. Axl and Beatrice's room, however, being too far from any fire had something we might recognise as an actual door; a large wooden frame criss-crossed with small branches, vines and thistles which someone going in and out would each time have to lift to one side, but which shut out the chilly draughts. Axl would happily have done without this door, but it had over time become an object of considerable pride to Beatrice. He had often returned to find his wife pulling off withered pieces from the construct and replacing them with fresh cuttings she had gathered during the day.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="屋内，巢穴里的通道仍旧漆黑一团，他只好摸索着走过那一小段路，回到住处。巢穴内所谓的“门”，大多不过是个拱廊，算是进入住处的标记。这种开放的布局，村民们不会认为有碍隐私，反而有利于房间保暖，大火堆或巢穴里许可的其他小火堆的暖气能通过通道传来。然而，埃克索和比特丽丝的房间远离火堆，倒有一扇真正的门，一个木头做的大框，上面纵横交错地绑着小树枝、蓟条和藤萝，要把它们撩到一边才能进出，但能挡住寒风。这扇门埃克索宁愿不要，但时日久了，门已经成为令比特丽丝颇感骄傲的物品。回家的时候，他常常发现妻子正在摘掉门上已经枯萎的藤蔓，换上她白天采摘来的新枝。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This morning, Axl moved the barrier just enough to let himself in, taking care to make as little noise as possible. Here, the early dawn light was leaking into the room through the small chinks of their outer wall. He could see his hand dimly before him, and on the turf bed, Beatrice's form still sound asleep under the thick blankets.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这天早晨，埃克索把门帘撩开一点点，刚好能让自己进屋，小心翼翼不吵醒妻子。晨曦透过外墙上的细缝渗入屋内。他能隐约看到自己的手，干草皮铺成的床上，比特丽丝盖着厚厚的毯子，还在沉睡。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was tempted to wake his wife. For a part of him felt sure that if, at this moment, she were awake and talking to him, whatever last barriers remained between him and his decision would finally crumble. But it was some time yet until the community roused itself and the day's work began, so he settled himself on the low stool in the corner of the chamber, his wife's cloak still tight around him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他想喊醒妻子。因为心里有个声音告诉他，此时此刻，如果妻子醒着、与他说话，他和那个决定之间无论还有什么阻碍，都会瞬间瓦解。可时候还早，要等一会儿村民们才会起床，开始一天的劳作，于是他在房间角落里那张矮凳上坐下来，身上仍旧紧紧裹着妻子的斗篷。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He wondered how thick the mist would be that morning, and if, as the dark faded, he would see it had seeped through the cracks right into their chamber. But then his thoughts drifted away from such matters, back to what had been preoccupying him. Had they always lived like this, just the two of them, at the periphery of the community? Or had things once been quite different? Earlier, outside, some fragments of a remembrance had come back to him: a small moment when he was walking down the long central corridor of the warren, his arm around one of his own children, his gait a little crouched not on account of age as it might be now, but simply because he wished to avoid hitting his head on the beams in the murky light. Possibly the child had just been speaking to him, saying something amusing, and they were both of them laughing. But now, as earlier outside, nothing would quite settle in his mind, and the more he concentrated, the fainter the fragments seemed to grow. Perhaps these were just an elderly fool's imaginings. Perhaps it was that God had never given them children.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他心想，不知道今天早上的雾有多重，天光渐亮，也许等会儿能看到雾从墙壁缝隙里渗入房间。接着，他的思绪又飘离了这些事情，回到他此前一直考虑的问题上。他们一直是这么生活的吗，就两个人，住在村子的边缘？抑或以前情况不是这样？刚才，在屋外，他回想起了以前的一些片段：那是个短暂的时刻，他走在巢穴中央长长的过道上，一条胳膊挽着自己的一个孩子，走路时微微弓着身，不是因为像现在这样上了年纪，而是不希望脑袋在昏暗中撞上屋梁。当时孩子可能在跟他说话，讲了什么好笑的事，两人都在大笑。可是现在呢，和之前在外面的时候一样，他脑子里一片模糊，越集中精力，那些片段似乎就越不清晰。也许这一切都是个老傻瓜的想象。也许上帝从来没有赐予他们孩子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">You may wonder why Axl did not turn to his fellow villagers for assistance in recalling the past, but this was not as easy as you might suppose. For in this community the past was rarely discussed. I do not mean that it was taboo. I mean that it had somehow faded into a mist as dense as that which hung over the marshes. It simply did not occur to these villagers to think about the past -- even the recent one.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="你可能会想，埃克索为什么不去找其他村民帮助他回忆往事呢？但这可能不像你想得这么容易。因为在这个群体中，人们很少谈论过去。我倒不是说这是什么禁忌。我是说，过去消失在一片迷雾之中，就像沼泽地上的雾气一样。这些村民就从没想过要去回想往事——哪怕是刚刚过去的事情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">To take an instance, one that had bothered Axl for some time: He was sure that not so long ago, there had been in their midst a woman with long red hair -- a woman regarded as crucial to their village. Whenever anyone injured themselves or fell sick, it had been this red-haired woman, so skilled at healing, who was immediately sent for. Yet now this same woman was no longer to be found anywhere, and no one seemed to wonder what had occurred, or even to express regret at her absence. When one morning Axl had mentioned the matter to three neighbours while working with them to break up the frosted field, their response told him that they genuinely had no idea what he was talking about. One of them had even paused in his work in an effort to remember, but had ended by shaking his head. "Must have been a long time ago," he had said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="举个例子吧。有件事已经让埃克索心烦了很长时间：他肯定，不久前村子里有个女人，长长的红色头发——大家认为这个女人对村庄很重要。有人受了伤或生了病，大家就立即去请这个红头发的女人，她有高超的治疗技能。可是，现在哪儿也找不到这个女人，好像也没人去想这是怎么回事，她不在了，都没人表示遗憾。有天上午，埃克索和三个邻居一起挖开霜冻的土地时，提起过这件事情，从他们的反应来看，他们是真的不明白他在说什么。其中一位还停下手中的农活，努力回想，但最后还是摇了摇头。“肯定是很久很久以前的事情，”他说。">查看中文翻译</div>

So the evening when, with less than an hour of daylight remaining, the mist coming in and the wolves audible on the hillside, the word went around that Marta was missing, everyone had stopped what they were doing in alarm. For the next little while, voices called her name all around the warren and footsteps rushed up and down its corridors as villagers searched every sleeping chamber, the storage burrows, the cavities beneath the rafters, any hiding place a child might go to amuse herself.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then in the midst of this panic, two shepherds returning from their shift on the hills came into the Great Chamber and began warming themselves by the fire. As they did so, one of them announced how the day before they had watched a wren-eagle circle above their heads, once, twice, then a third time. There was no mistake, he said, it had been a wren-eagle. Word quickly went around the warren and soon a crowd had gathered around the fire to listen to the shepherds. Even Axl had hurried to join them, for the appearance of a wren-eagle in their country was news indeed. Among the many powers attributed to the wren-eagle was the ability to frighten away wolves, and elsewhere in the land, it was said, wolves had vanished altogether on account of these birds.</div>

There had been many similar claims, someone pointed out, and each time they had proved unfounded. Someone else stated that these same two shepherds had only the previous spring brought back an identical story, and yet no further sightings had followed. The shepherds angrily denied bringing any such previous report, and soon the crowd was dividing between those taking the shepherds' side and those claiming some memory of the alleged episode the previous year.</div>

<div class="line_en">As the quarrel grew heated, Axl found coming over him that familiar nagging sense that something was not right, and removing himself from the shouting and jostling, went outside to stare at the darkening sky and the mist rolling over the ground. And after a while, fragments began to piece themselves together in his mind, of the missing Marta, of the danger, of how not long ago everyone had been searching for her. But already these recollections were growing confused, in much the way a dream does in the seconds after waking, and it was only with a supreme act of concentration that Axl held on to the thought of little Marta at all while voices behind him continued to argue about the wren-eagle. Then, as he was standing there like that, he heard the sound of a girl singing to herself and saw Marta emerge before him out of the mist.</div>

And to be frank, it had occurred to him that by coming in with her, he would get a little of the credit for her safe return. But as they entered the Great Chamber the villagers were still so engrossed in their quarrel over the shepherds only a few of them even bothered to look their way. Marta's mother did come away from the crowd long enough to say to the child: "So here you are! Don't you be wandering off that way! How often must I tell you?" before turning her attention back to the arguments raging around the fire.

<div class="line_en">The room had grown significantly lighter. Their chamber, being on the outer fringe, had a small window to the outside, though it was too high to gaze out of without standing on a stool. It was at this moment covered with a cloth, but now an early ray of sun was penetrating from one corner, casting a beam over where Beatrice was sleeping. Axl could see, caught in this ray, what looked like an insect hovering in the air just above his wife's head. He then realised it was a spider, suspended by its invisible vertical thread, and even as he watched, it started on its smooth descent. Rising noiselessly, Axl crossed the small room and swept his hand through the space above his sleeping wife, catching the spider within his palm. Then he stood there a moment looking down at her. There was a peacefulness on her sleeping face he rarely saw now when she was awake, and the sudden rush of happiness the sight brought him took him by surprise. He knew then he had made up his mind, and he wanted again to awaken her, just so he might break to her his news. But he saw the selfishness of such an action -- and besides, how could he be so sure of her response?

<div class="line_en">When earlier he had been sitting on the bench outside waiting for the first light, he had tried to recall how he and Beatrice had first come to discuss the idea of their journey. He had thought then he had located a particular conversation they had had one night in this same chamber, but now, as he watched the spider run round the edge of his hand and onto the earthen floor, it struck him with certainty that the first mention of the subject had come that day the stranger in dark rags had passed through the village.</div>

He was hurrying back to the warren from the fields, perhaps to fetch a tool or receive new instructions from a foreman. In any case, he was stopped by a burst of raised voices from beyond the bushes to his right. His first thought was of ogres, and he searched quickly around for a rock or stick. Then he realised the voices -- all of women -- though angry and excited, lacked the panic that accompanied ogre attacks. He nevertheless pushed his way determinedly through a hedge of juniper shrubs and stumbled into a clearing, where he saw five women -- not in their first youth, but still of child-bearing age -- standing closely together. Their backs were turned to him and they went on shouting at something in the distance. He was almost up to them before one of the women noticed him with a start, but then the others turned and regarded him almost with insolence.</div>

<div class="line_en">To our villagers, "the old thorn" denoted a local beauty spot as much as the actual hawthorn tree that grew seemingly right out of the rock at the edge of the promontory a short walk from the warren. On a sunny day, provided the wind was not strong, it was a pleasant place to pass the time. You had a good view of the land down to the water, of the river's curve and the marshes beyond. On Sundays children often played around the gnarled roots, sometimes daring to jump off the end of the promontory, which in fact had only a gentle drop that would cause a child no injury, but simply to roll like a barrel down the grassy slope. But on a morning like this one, when adults and children alike were busy with tasks, the spot would have been deserted, and Axl, coming through the mist up the incline, was not surprised to see the two women were alone, their figures almost silhouettes against the white sky. Sure enough, the stranger, seated with her back against the rock, was dressed curiously. From a distance, at least, her cloak appeared to be made of many separate pieces of cloth stitched together, and it was now flapping in the wind, giving its owner the appearance of a great bird about to take flight. Beside her, Beatrice -- still on her feet, though with head lowered towards her companion -- appeared slight and vulnerable. They were in earnest conversation, but spotting Axl's approach below, stopped and watched him. Then Beatrice came to the edge of the promontory and called down:</div>

For the truth was that while he had fully shared his wife's scorn for the suspicious instincts of the women, he had not been able to free himself from the thought that the stranger did pose some sort of threat, and he had been uneasy since leaving Beatrice with her. He was relieved then to see his wife's figure, alone on the promontory in front of the rock, looking out at the sky. She seemed lost in thought, and failed to notice him until he called up to her. As he watched her descending the path, more slowly than before, it occurred to him not for the first time that there was something different lately in her gait.

I say "as much as possible," for there appeared at times to be a need -- a compulsion, you might say -- to which one or the other would have to yield. But whatever discussions they had in such circumstances inevitably ended quickly in evasiveness or bad temper. And on the one occasion Axl had asked his wife straight out what the strange woman had said to her that day up at the old thorn, Beatrice's expression had clouded, and she had seemed for a moment on the verge of tears. After this, Axl had taken care to avoid any reference to the stranger.</div>

But then this morning, sitting outside in the cold hour before dawn, his memory seemed partially at least to clear, and many things had come back to him: the red-haired woman; Marta; the stranger in dark rags; other memories with which we need not concern ourselves here.

<div class="line_en">Sundays were a day of rest for these villagers, at least to the extent that they did not work in the fields. But the livestock had still to be cared for, and with so many other tasks waiting to be done, the pastor had accepted the impracticality of forbidding everything that might be construed as labour. So it was that when Axl emerged into the spring sunshine that particular Sunday after a morning of mending boots, the sight that greeted him was of his neighbours spread all around the terrain in front of the warren, some sitting in the patchy grass, others on small stools or logs, talking, laughing and working. Children were playing everywhere, and one group had gathered around two men constructing on the grass the wheel for a wagon. It was the first Sunday of the year the weather had permitted such outdoor activity, and there was an almost festive atmosphere. Nevertheless, as he stood there at the warren entrance and gazed beyond the villagers to where the land sloped down towards the marshes, Axl could see the mist rising again, and supposed that by the afternoon they would be submerged once more in grey drizzle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对这些村民来说，星期天是休息的日子，至少不需要到田地里干活。但牲口仍要照料，有很多事情等着去做，禁止一切可能称为劳作的事情是不可能的，牧师也接受了这一点。那个星期天，早晨埃克索补好靴子，然后走出屋子，来到春日的阳光下，看到邻居们全在巢穴外面，一些坐在草地上，另一些坐在小凳子或木头上，谈着，笑着，干着活儿。孩子们到处玩，有两个人在草坪上制作车轮，一帮孩子围着他们看。这一年里，这是第一个天气晴好、可以进行这种户外活动的星期天，因此有种节日般的气氛。埃克索站在巢穴入口处，目光越过村民们，望着远处的平地变成了下行的缓坡，与沼泽相连。这时候，他能看见迷雾又升了起来，心想，到下午，大家又要裹在灰色的蒙蒙雨雾中了。">查看中文翻译</div>

It did not greatly interest him at first, but then something in the breeze caught his ear and made him straighten.

<div class="line_en">Others too were stopping what they were doing to turn and stare. But now Axl hurried through their midst, narrowly avoiding wandering children and objects left on the grass. Before he could reach the small jostling knot of people, however, it suddenly dispersed, and Beatrice emerged from its centre, clutching something with both hands to her breast. The faces around her mostly showed amusement, but the woman who quickly appeared at his wife's shoulder -- the widow of a blacksmith who had died of fever the previous year -- had features twisted with fury. Beatrice shook off her tormentor, her own face all the time a stern, near-blank mask, but when she saw Axl coming towards her, it broke into emotion.</div>
