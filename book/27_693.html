<div class="line_en">The famous portrait photographer Martin Schoeller was softly whispering directions to Elizabeth in his thick German accent to elicit a range of emotions from her as he snapped her picture. She was wearing a thin black turtleneck and red lipstick, her hair brushed back in a loose bun that covered her ears. Two vertical lamps were set on either side of the chair she was sitting in to flatly illuminate her narrow face and create the white lights in her pupils that were a trademark of Schoeller's photographs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="世界知名人像摄影师马汀．薛勒（Martin Schoeller），用浓浓的德国口音轻声引导伊莉莎白，试图诱发她各种情绪，同时猛按快门拍下她的照片。她身穿黑色高领薄上衣，涂上红色口红，头发往后梳成松松的小包头，覆盖住耳朵；她坐在椅子上，两旁各有一盏直立灯照着她瘦长的脸庞，制造出瞳孔里的白光——这是薛勒摄影作品的正字标记。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hiring Schoeller had been the idea of Patrick O'Neill, the creative director of advertising agency TBWAChiatDay's Los Angeles office. ChiatDay was working on a secret marketing campaign for Theranos.

<div class="line_en">A strikingly handsome man with blond hair, blue eyes, and the sculpted physique of someone who worked out religiously, Patrick was taken with Elizabeth from the moment he met her. His attraction wasn't of a romantic nature; he was gay. Rather, he was drawn in by her charisma and her singular drive to put a dent in the universe. He'd worked at ChiatDay for fifteen years, creating ads for big corporate clients like Visa and IKEA. The work was interesting, but it didn't inspire him the way Elizabeth had when she'd first come to the agency's converted warehouse in Playa del Rey and described the Theranos mission of giving people access to pain-free, low-cost health care. In advertising, it wasn't often you got to work on something that really had the potential to make the world better.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="派屈克是个帅到叫人很难不注意的男性，金发蓝眼，雕像般的身形看得出勤于健身。他第一眼见到伊莉莎白就被她迷住了，但不是出于那种爱恋（他是男同志），而是被她散发的魅力以及想改变世界的非凡动力。他在ChiatDay工作已十五年，替Visa、IKEA等大企业打造广告，这份工作很有趣，但给他的激励并不如初次见到伊莉莎白被唤起的内心悸动。当时，伊莉莎白来到ChiatDay位于普拉亚德雷（Playa del Rey）、用仓库改装而成的办公室，阐述Theranos的使命是提供普罗大众无痛、低价的医疗照护——在广告业，你不常有机会从事真正可能使世界更美好的事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Elizabeth had chosen ChiatDay because it was the agency that represented Apple for many years, creating its iconic 1984 Macintosh ad and later its "Think Different" campaign in the late 1990s. She'd even tried to convince Lee Clow, the creative genius behind those ads, to come out of retirement to work for her. Clow had politely referred her back to the agency, where she had immediately connected with Patrick.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伊莉莎白之所以选择ChiatDay，是因为它是苹果长期御用的广告公司，替苹果创造出麦金塔电脑经典的「一九八四」广告，以及一九九〇年代晚期的「不同凡想」（Think Different）广告。她甚至企图说服那些广告背后的创意天才李．克劳（Lee Clow），重出江湖帮她，已退休的克劳客气地将她转介给ChiatDay，她立刻跟派屈克搭上线。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Patrick hadn't been surprised or put off by Theranos's insistence on absolute secrecy. Apple had been the same way. He understood technology companies' need to protect their valuable intellectual property. In any case, the company would soon be coming out of "stealth mode," as Elizabeth called it, and that's where he came in: his job was to make its commercial launch as impactful as possible.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对于Theranos坚持的绝对保密，派屈克并不惊讶，也没有因此被吓退，苹果向来也是如此。他了解科技公司必须保护珍贵的智能财产，反正Theranos很快就会从「隐藏模式」（这是伊莉莎白的用语）走出来，而这也是他现在登场的目的——尽可能使Theranos的商业上市令人难忘。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Redesigning the Theranos website was a big part of that. Schoeller's photos were going to be featured on it. Not just those of Elizabeth. The photographer had spent most of the two-day shoot at a studio in Culver City taking pictures of models posing as patients. They were of different ages, genders, and ethnicities: children under five, children between five and ten, young men and women, middle-aged folks, and seniors. Some were white, some black, others Hispanic or Asian. The message was that Theranos's blood-testing technology would help everyone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="工作重点是重新设计Theranos网站。薛勒的摄影作品将会用于网站上，那两天在卡尔佛市（Culver City）摄影棚，他不只拍摄伊莉莎白的照片，大部分的工作是拍摄妆扮成病人的模特儿照片，各种年龄、性别、族裔都有，五岁以下的幼儿、五岁到十岁的儿童、年轻男女、中年人、老人，有些是白人，有些是黑人，还有西班牙裔或亚裔，背后所要传达的消息是：任何人都能受惠于Theranos的血液检测技术。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Elizabeth and Patrick spent hours choosing which patient photos to use from the shoot. Elizabeth wanted the faces displayed on the website to communicate empathy. She talked movingly about the sadness people felt when they found out that a loved one was sick and that it was too late to do anything about it. Theranos's painless blood tests would change that by catching diseases early, before they became a death sentence, she said.</div>

<div class="line_en">Patrick and a group of his ChiatDay colleagues had been flying up to Palo Alto once a week to brainstorm with Elizabeth, Sunny, and her brother Christian throughout the fall of 2012 and into the winter and spring of 2013-- the period when Ian Gibbons was spiraling into depression and Steve Burd was serving out his last months as Safeway CEO. Elizabeth scheduled the meetings on Wednesdays after learning that Apple's creative meetings with the agency had always been that day of the week. She told Patrick she admired the simplicity of Apple's brand message and wanted to emulate it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每周一次，派屈克和ChiatDay团队会往北飞至帕罗奥图，跟伊莉莎白、桑尼、伊莉莎白弟弟克利斯勤开动脑会议，从二〇一二年秋冬持续到二〇一三年春天——也就是伊恩．吉本斯陷入忧郁症、史帝夫．博德最后几个月担任喜互惠首席执行官时期。伊莉莎白把动脑会议排在每周三，因为她得知苹果以前跟ChiatDay的创意会议就在周三。她告诉派屈克，自己很欣赏苹果品牌广告的简洁，希望比照办理。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Inside ChiatDay, the Theranos assignment was known as "Project Stanford." Joining Patrick on the weekly trips up to Palo Alto were Carisa Bianchi, the president of the agency's L. A. office; Lorraine Ketch, the agency's chief of strategy; Stan Fiorito, who oversaw the account; and Mike Yagi, a copywriter. Early on, the ChiatDay team decided that the best visual representation of Theranos's innovation was the miniature vial it had created to collect blood from fingertips. Elizabeth called it the "nanotainer." It was fitting because it really was tiny.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="ChiatDay内部把Theranos的案子称为「斯坦福企划案」。每周跟派屈克一起北上帕罗奥图的人有：柯瑞莎．毕昂姬（Carisa Bianchi，ChiatDay洛杉矶分公司总裁）、萝瑞．凯区（Lorraine Ketch，ChiatDay策略长）、负责Theranos的史丹．菲尔里托（Stan Fiorito），以及写文案的麦克．八木（Mike Yagi）。ChiatDay团队一开始就决定，最能传达Theranos创新之处的图像视觉，就是采集指尖血液所用的微小玻璃瓶，伊莉莎白称之为「纳米容器」（nanotainer），这再适合不过了，因为真的很小。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On the appointed day, Dan Edlin, one of Christian's Duke friends, flew down to L. A. with a custom-made plastic case containing twelve nanotainers. Checking it in with his bag at the airport was out of the question; it remained in his possession the whole flight down. When he got to the warehouse, Dan didn't let the little tubes out of his sight. No one at the agency was allowed to touch them except Patrick, who held one briefly and marveled at how small it was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拍照当天，丹．艾德林（克利斯勤的杜克帮之一）南下洛杉矶，带着订做的塑胶盒、里头装了十二个纳米容器，跟着行李一起托运是不可能的，所以整个航行一直放在他的随身包包里。等到他抵达ChiatDay的仓库办公室，丹也没有让它片刻离开他的视线，ChiatDay的人完全不可以触摸，除了派屈克，他短暂拿起一个，赞叹其微小。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At 1.29 centimeters, it was shorter than a dime positioned upright. Patrick wanted to take pictures of it to convey its scale to doctors and patients. But Elizabeth and Sunny were very concerned that word of it might leak out before the launch if anyone from the outside was allowed to see it. So they agreed that ChiatDay would use its in-house photographer to take photos of it in the little photography studio the agency had in its Playa del Rey warehouse.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="纳米容器只有1.29公分，比直立的一角硬币还短。派屈克想透过照片传达纳米容器的微小给医师和患者，但伊莉莎白和桑尼很担心，如果让外部人员看到，可能在推出前就会外流，所以说好在ChiatDay自己的小摄影棚拍摄，由内部的摄影师操刀。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Real blood tended to turn purple after a while when it was exposed to air, so they filled one of the nanotainers with fake Halloween blood and took pictures of it against a white background. Patrick then made a photo montage showing it balancing on the tip of a finger. As he'd anticipated, it made for an arresting visual. Mike Yagi tried out different slogans to go with it, eventually settling on two that Elizabeth really liked: "One tiny drop changes everything" and "The lab test, reinvented." They blew the photo up and turned it into a mock full-page ad in the Wall Street Journal. In advertising lingo, this was known as a "tip-in." Elizabeth loved it and ordered a dozen more versions of it. She didn't say what she wanted them for, but Stan Fiorito got the sense she was using them as props during meetings with her board.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="真正的血液接触空气一阵子之后会变成紫色，于是他们将纳米容器装满假的万圣节道具血液，衬著白色背景拍照，派屈克再剪辑成纳米容器放在指尖上的图像，做出来的视觉效果一如他所预料，非常吸睛。麦克．八木则是尝试配上八句不同的标语，最后决定采用伊莉莎白喜欢的两句：小小一滴改变一切（One tiny drop changes everything。）；实验室检验，打掉重练（The lab test， reinvented。）。他们放大照片，仿制成《华尔街日报》全版广告，用广告术语来说便是「夹页广告」。伊莉莎白爱死了，要求多做十几个，她并没有说要拿去做什么，但史丹．菲尔里托觉得她拿去当成道具，用于董事会议上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Patrick also worked with Elizabeth on a new company logo. Elizabeth believed in the Flower of Life, a geometric pattern of intersecting circles within a larger circle that pagans once considered the visual expression of the life that runs through all sentient beings. It was later adopted by the 1970s New Age movement as "sacred geometry" that provided enlightenment to those who spent time studying it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="派屈克也和伊莉莎白共同设计新的公司标志。伊莉莎白很相信「生命之花」（the Flower of Life），那是一种几何图案，一个大圆圈内部交织着许多小圆圈，异教徒以前认为那是一种视觉表现，传达出所有有知觉的人类共同的生命经验。后来，一九七〇年代的新时代运动（New Age movement）把「生命之花」转化为「神圣几何」，认为只要花时间研究就可从中获得启发。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">While Patrick remained entranced with Elizabeth, Stan Fiorito was more circumspect. A gregarious ad industry veteran with reddish blond hair and freckles, Stan thought there was something odd about Sunny. He used a lot of software engineering jargon in their weekly meetings that had no applicability whatsoever to their marketing discussions. And when Stan tried to get him to walk him through how he'd arrived at what seemed like extremely aggressive sales targets, Sunny gave vague and boastful answers. Normally, companies did research to determine the size of the audience they were marketing to and then worked out what percentage of that audience they could realistically hope to convert into customers. But such basic concepts seemed lost on Sunny. Stan tried to look him up on the internet but couldn't find anything. He thought it was strange that someone with his background -- a tech entrepreneur who had sold a company during the dot-com boom and made a lot of money in the process -- had left no trace on the web. He wondered if Sunny had hired someone to scrub it for him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="派屈克仍然臣服于伊莉莎白的同时，史丹．菲尔里托则谨慎许多。这位喜好交际的广告界老兵，有着一头略带红色的金发以及雀斑，他觉得桑尼有些地方怪怪的。每周例行会议上，桑尼会大量使用软件术语，却跟他们讨论的行销策略毫不相关。每当史丹请他说明，那些极度乐观的销售目标是如何达成，桑尼的答案总是含糊、流于自吹自擂。一般来说，公司会做调查研究来决定行销对象，然后务实预估其中有多少比例真的可转化成消费者，但这类基本概念在桑尼身上似乎付之阙如。史丹曾在网络上搜索桑尼，但什么都没找到，他心里很纳闷，有那样背景的人（在网络泡沫时期卖掉公司大赚一笔的科技创业家），怎么会在网络上没留下任何足迹。他怀疑，是不是桑尼雇人抹掉他在网络上的所有数据。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The circle thus became the guiding motif of the Theranos brand. The inside of the "o" in "Theranos" was painted green to make it stand out, and the photos of the patient faces and of the nanotainer balancing on a fingertip were framed by circles. Patrick also created a new font for the website and marketing materials derived from Helvetica in which the dots over the "i" and the "j" and the periods at the end of sentences were round instead of square. Elizabeth seemed pleased with the results.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那些圆圈因而成为Theranos品牌的基调。Theranos的o涂满了绿色以便凸显，病人的大头照以及指尖上的纳米容器照片，也都用圆圈框起来。派屈克还替网站和行销数据设计了一款新字体，根据Helvetica字体改变而成，i和J上方的一点以及句子末尾的句点都改成圆形，而不是方形。伊莉莎白似乎对成果十分满意。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That would help explain the level of secrecy. Per Sunny's instructions, any materials Theranos provided to ChiatDay had to be numbered, logged, and kept in a locked room that only the team assigned to work on the account had access to. Any printing had to be done on a dedicated printer inside the room. Discarded materials couldn't just be thrown away, they had to be shredded. Computer files had to be stored on a separate server and could only be shared among the team via a dedicated intranet. And under no circumstances were they to share information about Theranos with anyone from ChiatDay's L. A. office or the agency's broader network who hadn't signed a confidentiality agreement.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="果真如此的话，有这种等级的保密措施就很合理了。在桑尼的指示下，Theranos提供给ChiatDay的任何数据都必须编码、记录，存放在上锁的房间里，只有经手Theranos的团队能进入，所有打印工作也必须在那个房间里的指定打印机进行；丢弃不用的数据不可以就这样扔掉，必须用碎纸机撕毁；电脑文件必须保存在一台独立的服务器，只能用专属的内部网络分享给负责Theranos的团队；不管什么情况，都不可以将Theranos相关数据分享给没有签署保密切结书的人，包括ChiatDay洛杉矶分公司或其他单位人员。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was also highly unusual for an obscure startup to hire a big ad agency like ChiatDay. With their overhead and staffing, the big agencies were expensive. ChiatDay was charging Theranos an annual retainer of $6 million a year. Where was this company nobody had heard of before getting the money to pay these types of fees? Elizabeth had stated on several occasions that the army was using her technology on the battlefield in Afghanistan and that it was saving soldiers' lives. Stan wondered if Theranos was funded by the Pentagon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一家没没无闻的新创公司，竟然请得起ChiatDay这么赫赫有名的大广告公司，也极不寻常。ChiatDay这种管销费用和人事支出庞大的广告公司，索价不菲，Theranos每年要支付六百万美元，这家没人听过的公司是从哪里拿钱支付这么庞大的费用？伊莉莎白说过好几次，她的技术被军方用于阿富汗战场、拯救军人性命，史丹猜想Theranos是不是有国防部资助。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Elizabeth wanted the website and all the various marketing materials to feature bold, affirmative statements. One was that Theranos could run "over 800 tests' on a drop of blood. Another was that its technology was more accurate than traditional lab testing. She also wanted to say that Theranos test results were ready in less than thirty minutes and that its tests were "approved by FDA" and "endorsed by key medical centers" such as the Mayo Clinic and the University of California, San Francisco's medical school, using the FDA, Mayo Clinic, and UCSF logos.</div>

<div class="line_en">As the months passed, Kate and Mike also began to develop concerns about their strange and demanding client. Both were from the East Coast and brought no-nonsense attitudes to their jobs. Kate, who was twenty-eight, grew up in Lincoln, Massachusetts, and played ice hockey at Boston University. Her proper, small-town upbringing had given her a strong moral compass. She also knew a thing or two about medicine: her dad and her wife were both doctors. Mike, who was thirty-two, was an Italian American from Philadelphia with a cynical streak who ran track and cross-country in college and graduate school.

<div class="line_en">When she inquired about the basis for the claim about Theranos's superior accuracy, Kate learned that it was extrapolated from a study that had concluded that 93 percent of lab mistakes were due to human error. Theranos argued that, since its testing process was fully automated inside its device, that was grounds enough to say that it was more accurate than other labs. Kate thought that was a big leap in logic and said so. After all, there were laws against misleading advertising.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当凯特进一步询问，Theranos准确度较高的说法有何依据，她才得知那只是个推断，来自一份研究的结论：「实验室九三％的误差是人为疏失所致」。Theranos因而主张：其检测过程全在设备内部自动完成，因此足以推断Theranos比其他实验室更精准。凯特认为这种推断在逻辑上太跳跃，并且明白指出这点，毕竟法律不允许广告误导。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mike felt the same way. In an email to Kate listing items that needed legal review, he included "Automation makes us more accurate" and wrote in parentheses next to it, "this sounds like a puffery claim." Mike had never worked on a marketing campaign that involved medicine before and wanted to proceed extra carefully. Usually, health-care campaigns, such as those involving pharmaceutical companies, were handled out of New York by a special division of the agency called TBWAHealth. He wondered why it wasn't handling this assignment or at least being consulted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈可也有同感。他寄了封电邮给凯特，列出需要法务部门过目的内容，其中包括「自动化使我们更精准」，他在旁边加注括号写「这听起来是夸大说法」。迈可从未做过医疗方面的行销宣传，所以想格外谨慎。健康医疗行销（譬如牵涉到制药公司的行销活动），通常会由纽约的TBWAHealth特别单位处理，他不知道为什么这次不是如此，至少也该咨询过那个单位才对。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Those quotes weren't from any lengthy report, however. They were from the two-page summary of Elizabeth and Sunny's meeting with five Hopkins officials in April 2010. As it had done with Walgreens, Theranos was again using that meeting to claim that its system had been independently evaluated. But that simply wasn't true. Bill Clarke, the director of clinical toxicology at the Johns Hopkins Hospital and one of three university scientists who attended the 2010 meeting, had asked Elizabeth to ship one of her devices to his lab so he could put it through its paces and compare its performance to the equipment he normally used. She had indicated she would but had never followed through. Kate and Mike didn't know any of this, but the fact that Theranos refused to show them the full report made them suspicious.</div>

<div class="line_en">Elizabeth had mentioned a report several hundred pages long supporting Theranos's scientific claims. Kate and Mike repeatedly asked to see it, but Theranos wouldn't produce it. Instead, the company sent them a password-protected file containing what it said were excerpts from the report. It stated that the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine had conducted due diligence on the Theranos technology and found it "novel and sound" and capable of "accurately" running "a wide range of routine and special assays."</div>

<div class="line_en">To gain some insights into how to market to doctors, ChiatDay proposed conducting focus group interviews with a few physicians. Theranos signed off on the idea but wanted to keep things hush-hush, so Kate enlisted her wife and her father to participate in them.</div>

<div class="line_en">Kate and Mike's main contacts at Theranos were Christian Holmes and his two Duke fraternity brothers, Dan Edlin and Jeff Blickman. Mike called them the "Therabros." He and Kate talked on the phone and exchanged emails with them frequently in the lead-up to the website launch. Theranos had initially wanted to go live with the site on April 1, 2013, but pushed the date back several times. A new launch date was set for September, but as the new deadline approached and Kate and Mike pressed the Therabros for substantiation to back up the claims Elizabeth wanted to make, it became apparent to them that some were exaggerated.</div>

<div class="line_en">Kate's wife, Tracy, was chief resident at Los Angeles County General, where she was completing a residency in internal medicine and pediatrics. During her interview, which was conducted by phone, Tracy asked some questions that no one on the Theranos end of the line seemed able to answer. That evening, she told Kate she was dubious that the company had any truly novel technology. She questioned especially the notion that you could get enough blood from a finger to run tests accurately. Tracy's skepticism gave Kate pause.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mike was getting worried about ChiatDay's legal liability. He went back and read the agency's contract with Theranos. It indemnified ChiatDay for any claims made in marketing materials that the client had approved in writing. He fired off an email to Joe Sena, an attorney at the agency's outside law firm, Davis &amp; Gilbert, asking if ChiatDay should make Theranos use specific language in its written approvals. Sena replied that it wasn't necessary but urged him to keep track of those written approvals.</div>

<div class="line_en">For instance, they gleaned that Theranos couldn't produce tests results in less than thirty minutes. Kate watered that statement down to say that the results were ready in '4 hours or less," which she still had her doubts about. Kate and Mike also began to suspect that Theranos couldn't perform all its blood tests from small finger-stick draws and that it used traditional venous draws for some tests. They suggested adding a disclaimer to the website to make that clear, but the response they got from Christian and Jeff was that Elizabeth didn't want a disclaimer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="举个例子，从他们收集到的数据来看，Theranos的检测结果无法在三十分钟内出炉，于是凯特把那句陈述改写为「最慢四小时」可得知结果，只是她对四小时仍然存疑。凯特和迈可也开始猜测，Theranos无法光靠扎手指取得的少量血液就能运行所有检测，也怀疑有些检测是用传统静脉抽血。两人建议在网站附上免责声明（disclaimer）说明清楚，但是从克利斯勤和杰夫那得到的回复是：伊莉莎白不想要有免责声明。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Kate, meanwhile, was sparring with Christian and Jeff about a line Elizabeth wanted to add to the website that read, "Send samples to us." Kate asked them what logistical system the company had in place to transport the blood samples from physicians' offices to its lab and eventually concluded it didn't have any. Doctors who "registered" for the service would merely be generating an automated email routed to Jeff's in-box. What would happen after that was anyone's guess. No one at Theranos had bothered to think it through, as far as Kate could tell.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="另一方面，凯特正在跟克利斯勤、杰夫争论，伊莉莎白想加进网站的一句话：「请把样本寄给我们。」凯特问他们，Theranos是否已经把后勤系统准备好，可将血液样品从医师诊所送到Theranos实验室。最后得到的结论是：没有。医师们若在网站上「注册加入」这项服务，只会自动产生一封电邮寄到杰夫的收件匣，接下来会发生什么事就无人知晓。就凯特所知，Theranos没有人有那个心思去思考后续。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The forty-eight hours before the website went live turned into a mad scramble. Mike Yagi, who for months had been laboring to write and rewrite copy to Elizabeth's satisfaction and was under a lot of stress, had an anxiety attack and went home to rest. He left the office so abruptly and in such a state that his colleagues didn't know whether he'd ever be coming back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="网站上线前四十八小时，陷入一团混乱。麦克．八木几个月来为了令伊莉莎白满意，一再重写文案，压力大到焦虑症发作，因而回家休息。他离开得太突然，同事们甚至不知道他会不会再回来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then, on the evening before the launch, Theranos sent word that it wanted to have an emergency conference call. Kate, Mike, Patrick, Lorraine Ketch, and a copywriter named Kristina Altepeter who was filling in for Yagi gathered in the warehouse's board room (so named because its table was made from surfboards) and listened as Elizabeth announced that Theranos's legal team had ordered last-minute wording changes. Kate and Mike were annoyed. They'd been requesting a legal review for months. Why was it only happening now?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着，上线前一晚，Theranos捎来消息表示想紧急进行视频会议。凯特、迈可、派屈克、萝瑞．凯区，以及替代八木的文案人员克莉丝汀娜．奥迪佩特（Kristina Altepeter），齐聚在仓库办公室的「董事会会议室」——里面的桌子是用冲浪板（surfboard）替代，因而取名为板子房（board room，另个意思是「董事会会议室」）——听着伊莉莎白宣布Theranos法务团队，在最后一刻要更改用字遣词，凯特和迈可很生气，他们要求Theranos法务部门审核已经好几个月，为什么现在才要改？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The call dragged on for more than three hours until 10:30 p. m. They went over the site line by line, as Elizabeth slowly dictated every alteration that needed to be made. Patrick nodded off at one point. But Kate and Mike stayed alert enough to notice that the language was being systematically dialed back. "Welcome to a revolution in lab testing" was changed to "Welcome to Theranos." "Faster results. Faster answers' became "Fast results. Fast answers." "A tiny drop is all it takes" was now "A few drops is all it takes."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="会议持续三个多小时，一直开到晚上十点半，众人逐句查看网站上的文案，伊莉莎白慢慢口述每个需要修改的地方，派屈克还一度睡着，不过凯特和迈可清醒得很，清醒到足以发现文本全面趋向保守。「欢迎来到实验室检验的大革命」改成「欢迎来到Theranos」；「更快速的结果，更快速的答案」变成「快速的结果，快速的答案」；「只需一滴」改成「只需几滴」。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A blurb of text next to the photo of a blond-haired, blue-eyed toddler under the headline "Goodbye, big bad needle" had previously referred only to finger-stick draws. Now it read, "Instead of a huge needle, we can use a tiny finger stick or collect a micro-sample from a venous draw." It wasn't lost on Kate and Mike that this was tantamount to the disclaimer they had previously suggested.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一张金发蓝眼幼儿照片旁有段宣传文本，标题为「再见，讨厌的大针头」，原本是指只要扎手指取血即可，现在改成「我们可以用小针扎手指取代大针头，或者透过静脉抽血采集微量样本」。凯特和迈可不可能看不出来，这些修改无异于他们先前提议的免责声明。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In a part of the site titled "Our Lab," a banner running across the page beneath an enlarged photo of a nanotainer had stated, "At Theranos, we can perform all of our lab tests on a sample 1/₁,₀₀₀ the size of a typical blood draw." In the new version of the banner, the words "all of" were gone. Lower down on the same page was the claim Kate had pushed back against months earlier. Under the heading "Unrivaled accuracy," it cited the statistic about 93 percent of lab errors being caused by humans and inferred from it that "no other laboratory is more accurate than Theranos." Sure enough, that was walked back too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="网站有个部分是「我们的实验室」，网页上有张放大的纳米容器照片，图片下方有个横跨整页的横幅写着：「在Theranos，我们只需一般抽血量的千分之一，即可运行所有实验室检验」，新版本把「所有」拿掉了。同一页往下拉，是凯特几个月前质疑的部分。在标题「无可匹敌的精确度」下方，引用统计数字指出实验室检验误差有九三％起因于人为疏失，并以此推论出：「没有任何实验室比Theranos精确」。果不其然，这也是退守。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The last-minute revisions only served to reinforce Kate and Mike's suspicions. Elizabeth had wanted all those sweeping claims to be true, but just because you badly wanted something to be real didn't make it so, Mike thought. He and Kate were beginning to question whether Theranos had any technology at all. Did its vaunted "black box," as people at ChiatDay referred to the Theranos device, even exist?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后一刻的修改，更坐实了凯特和迈可的怀疑。伊莉莎白很希望那些夸口强势的说词是真的，但不会只因为你很希望某事成真就真的会成真，迈可心想。他和凯特甚至开始怀疑Theranos到底有没有任何技术，它所吹嘘的「黑盒子」（ChiatDay人员提到Theranos设备时的用语）真的存在吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They shared their mounting doubts with Stan, whose own interactions with Sunny were becoming increasingly unpleasant. Every quarter, Stan was having to chase Sunny around for money. Sunny kept asking him to justify the bills the agency submitted. Stan spent hours going over them with him point by point.

<div class="line_en">Not everyone at ChiatDay was souring on Theranos, however. The L. A. office's two higher-ups, Carisa and Patrick, remained smitten with Elizabeth. Patrick idolized Lee Clow and the marketing magic he had conjured up for Apple. It was clear he thought Theranos had the potential to become his own big legacy moment. Kate voiced her concerns to him on several occasions, but he dismissed them as Kate just being Kate. She had a tendency to be overly dramatic, Patrick thought. His view was that she and Mike should stop questioning everything and just complete the work they were being asked to do. In Patrick's experience, all tech startups were chaotic and secretive. He saw nothing unusual or worrisome in that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过， ChiatDay并不是所有人都对Theranos感觉很差，洛杉矶分公司两位高层——柯瑞莎．毕昂姬和派屈克——仍然对伊莉莎白神魂颠倒。派屈克把李．克劳当成偶像，很崇拜他替苹果施展的行销魔法，显然他认为Theranos有可能成为自己的传奇之作。凯特跟他表达过好几次自己的忧虑，但他不当一回事，认为是凯特自己有问题。他觉得凯特很容易把事情过度戏剧化，依他看来，凯特和迈可不该再质疑这、质疑那，只要好好完成分内工作就是，根据他的经验，所有科技新创公司都很混乱，都是神神秘秘的，他看不出有什么不寻常、有什么好担心。">查看中文翻译</div>
