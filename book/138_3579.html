<div class="line_en">Ever since he was a child, M. Caillard had only had one idea in his head -- to wear the ribbon of an order. When he was still quite a small boy he used to wear a zinc cross of the Legion of Honor pinned on his tunic, just as other children wear a soldier's cap, and he took his mother's hand in the street with a proud air, sticking out his little chest with its red ribbon and metal star so that it might show to advantage.</div>

<div class="line_en">He sought for easier subjects, and began several in succession. The first was, "The Instruction of Children by Means of the Eye." He wanted gratuitous theatres to be established in every poor quarter of Paris for little children. Their parents were to take them there when they were quite young, and, by means of a magic lantern, all the notions of human knowledge were to be imparted to them. There were to be regular courses. The sight would educate the mind, while the pictures would remain impressed on the brain, and thus science would, so to say, be made visible. What could be more simple than to teach universal history, natural history, geography, botany, zoology, anatomy, etc., etc., in this manner?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他找了好些比较容易的主题，并且接连着手了好几个：最初的是《儿童的直观教育》。他主张应当在贫民区域里专为儿童设立一些不收费用的戏院样的场所。从很幼的年龄，父母就引他们进去看，院里利用幻灯使他们获得人生一切常识的大概。这可以算得是真正的学校。视官是可以教育头脑的，图画是可以刻画在记忆里的，这样就使科学都成为看得见的了。这样去教授世界史、地理、自然科学、植物学、动物学、生理学等等，哪儿还有更简单的方法？">查看中文翻译</div>
