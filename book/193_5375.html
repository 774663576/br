<div class="line_en">The camerlegno could still remember lying on the floor in tattered nightclothes, clawing at his own flesh, trying to purge his soul of the pain brought on by a vile truth he had just learned. It cannot be! he had screamed. And yet he knew it was. The deception tore at him like the fires of hell. The bishop who had taken him in, the man who had been like a father to him, the clergyman whom the camerlegno had stood beside while he rose to the papacy… was a fraud. A common sinner. Lying to the world about a deed so traitorous at its core that the camerlegno doubted even God could forgive it. "Yourvow!" the camerlegno had screamed at the Pope. "You broke your vow to God! You, of all men!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="总司库还记得自己穿著破烂的睡衣躺在地板上，抓著自己的皮肤，他刚刚得知了一件丑恶的事实，他想洗净自己灵魂被激起的痛苦。不可能！他嘶喊著。然而他知道事情就是如此。那件欺瞒之事有如地狱之火撕扯著他。曾经收容他的那位主教，一直就像他的父亲，当年总司库就站在旁边看著他当上教宗的那位圣职人员……竟然是个骗子，一个平凡的罪人。他对全世界隐瞒了一件背叛至极的行为，总司库觉得连上帝都不会原谅他。「你的誓愿！」总司库朝著教宗喊道。「你违背了对天主的誓愿！你，偏偏是你！」">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The camerlegno had often prayed to God to show him how to make the people believe again. But God had been silent. It was not until the camerlegno's moment of deepest darkness that God had come to him. Oh, the horror of that night!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="以前总司库总是向天主祷告，希望能告诉他如何让世人再度相信。但天主总是沉默。直到总司库陷入最黑暗的谷底，那一刻天主来到他面前。啊，那一夜的恐怖！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Pope had tried to explain himself, but the camerlegno could not listen. He had run out, staggering blindly through the hallways, vomiting, tearing at his own skin, until he found himself bloody and alone, lying on the cold earthen floor before St. Peter's tomb. Mother Mary, what do I do? It was in that moment of pain and betrayal, as the camerlegno lay devastated in the Necropolis, praying for God to take him from this faithless world, that God had come.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="教宗想解释，但总司库听不到了。他已经跑走了，盲目地踉跄跑过一道道走廊，一路呕吐，撕扯著自己的皮肤，直到最后他发现自己浑身是血，独自躺在圣彼得坟墓前的泥土地上。圣母马利亚，我该怎麽办？就在那一刻的痛苦与背叛中，总司库心力交瘁躺在古坟场，祈祷上帝带他离开这个不信神的世界，此时上帝出现了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The camerlegno felt reborn. The Swiss Guard had bandaged his chest, bathed him, and dressed him in a fresh white linen robe. They had also given him an injection of morphine for the burn. The camerlegno wished they had not given him painkillers. Jesus endured his pain for three days on the cross! He could already feel the drug uprooting his senses… a dizzying undertow.</div>

<div class="line_en">As he walked into the chapel, he was not at all surprised to see the cardinals staring at him in wonder. They are in awe of God, he reminded himself. Not of me, but how God works THROUGH me. As he moved up the center aisle, he saw bewilderment in every face. And yet, with each new face he passed, he sensed something else in their eyes. What was it? The camerlegno had tried to imagine how they would receive him tonight. Joyfully? Reverently? He tried to read their eyes and saw neither emotion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他走进礼拜堂时，毫不意外地看到枢机主教们惊奇地注视著他。他们敬畏的是天主，他提醒自己。不是我，但天主透过我完成了何等事功。他沿著中央走道往前，看到了每张脸上露出的困惑。然而，随著他经过的一张张脸，他感觉到他们眼中还有别的。那是什麽？总司库曾想像过他们今晚会如何迎接他，欢喜？恭敬？他努力想辨认他们眼中的感情，却看不到欢喜和恭敬。">查看中文翻译</div>
