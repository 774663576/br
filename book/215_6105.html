<div class="line_en">My mother had already spent a lot of time humming over pie recipes and going through her closet for "something suitable to wear." She'd even bought a new shirt for Dad and had scrutinized what the boys intended to wear. Obviously she was looking forward to the dinner -- not that I really understood that, but I didn't want to ruin everything by telling her about my newfound hatred of Bryce.</div>

<div class="line_en">Friday at school I avoided the blue-eyed brat the best I could, but that night as I got dressed, I found myself staring at the painting my father had given me and became furious all over again. Bryce had never been a friend to me, ever! He hadn't made a stand for the tree, he'd thrown away my eggs, and he'd made fun of me at my uncle's expense… Why was I playing along like we were jolly friends and neighbors?</div>

<div class="line_en">Chet answered the door. Maybe I should've been mad at him, too, for telling the Loskis about my uncle, but I wasn't. I hadn't asked him not to tell, and he certainly wasn't the one making fun of David.</div>

I just couldn't. I took a deep breath, wrapped up a pie, and shuffled across the street behind my brothers and parents.</div>

<div class="line_en">It didn't take me long to realize that I'd made a mistake. I should have let him say he was sorry and then simply continued to ignore him. But I'd snapped at him in the middle of an apology, which somehow made me the rude one.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="她看起来有些不确定，但挺开心。她正在和我爸爸分享神秘的微笑，而诚实地说，我认为她甚至咯咯笑了起来。我爸爸看起来被逗笑了，虽然他还是有些矜持，直到整首歌的结尾我才发现他在自豪。为这些噪音是从他的男孩们传来感到自豪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We'd heard this song, "Candle Ice," pouring out of my brothers" bedroom at least a million times, so we were used to it.

<div class="line_cn" title="我们听到过这首歌，“蜡烛冰”，至少有百万次从我哥哥们的房间里传出来，所以我们已经习惯了。但我看着我妈妈，担心她会为扭曲的吉他和坚硬的抒情感到尴尬。这肯定不是什么鱼子酱音乐。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That surprised me. Dad has never been real big on any rendition of my brothers' band, although he's never really criticized it either. But then Mr. Loski started grilling Matt and Mike about how they'd afforded to record their own music, and they explained about working and saving and shopping for good deals on equipment, and that's when I realized why my father was proud.</div>

<div class="line_en">As I looked around, it struck me that we were having dinner with a group of strangers. We'd lived across the street for years, but I didn't know these people at all. Lynetta did know how to smile. Mr. Loski was clean and smooth on the outside, but there was a distinct whiff of something rotten buried just beneath the surface. And the ever-efficient Mrs. Loski seemed flustered, almost hyper. Was it having us over that was making her nervous?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当我环顾四周时，我发现我们在和一群陌生人吃晚饭。我们两家住在对面这么多年，而我根本不了解这些人。琳内塔确实知道怎么微笑。洛世奇先生外表光鲜，而他外表下有些截然不同的东西已经腐烂。还有一直以来都很能干的洛世奇太太看起来不安，几乎是过度激动。是因为请我们过来使他紧张吗？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then there was Bryce -- the most disturbing of all because I had to admit that I didn't really know him, either. And based on what I'd discovered lately, I didn't care to know any more. Looking across the table at him, all I got was a strange, detached, neutral feeling. No fireworks, no leftover anger or resurging flutters.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后那里是布莱斯——最令人烦恼的一个，因为我必须承认我并不真正了解他。而在我最近所发现的基础上，我也不在乎了解他了。看着桌子对面的他，我在看个陌生人，疏远，模糊的感觉。没有火药味，没有未用尽的怒火或是复苏的悸动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After we'd had dessert and it was time to go, I went up to Bryce and told him I was sorry for having been so fierce when we'd first come in. "I should've let you apologize, and really, it was very nice of your family to have us over. I know it was a lot of work and, well, I think my mom had a really good time and that's what matters to me." We were looking right at each other, but it was almost as though he didn't hear me. "Bryce? I said I'm sorry."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们吃过甜点，该是离开的时间了，我走到布莱斯那儿告诉他我为刚进来时这么凶狠感到抱歉。“我应该让你道歉的，而且真的，你们家能邀请我们很好。我知道有很多工作要做而且，嗯，我认为我妈妈过得很愉快，这对我来说才是重要的。”我们就直视着对方，但是这几乎像他没有听见我。“布莱斯？我说我很抱歉。”">查看中文翻译</div>
