For now they saw before them Caldron Pool and beyond the Pool the high unclimbable cliffs and, pouring down the cliffs, thousands of tons of water every second, flashing like diamonds in some places and dark, glassy green in others, the Great Waterfall; and already the thunder of it was in their ears.</div>

<div class="line_en">If one could run without getting tired, I don't think one would often want to do anything else. But there might be special reasons for stopping, and it was a special reason which made Eustace presently shout: "I say! Steady! Look what we're coming to!"</div>

<div class="line_en">What looked funniest was the Dogs. During the gallop they had not been at all out of breath, but now, as they swarmed and wriggled upwards, there was plenty of spluttering and sneezing among them; that was because they would keep on barking, and every time they barked they got their mouths and noses full of water. But before Jill had time to notice all these things fully, she was going up the Waterfall herself. It was the sort of thing that would have been quite impossible in our world. Even if you hadn't been drowned, you would have been smashed to pieces by the terrible weight of water against the countless jags of rock. But in that world you could do it. You went on, up and up, with all kinds of reflected lights flashing at you from the water and all manner of coloured stones flashing through it, till it seemed as if you were climbing up light itself -- and always higher and higher till the sense of height would have terrified you if you could be terrified, but later it was only gloriously exciting. And then at last one came to the lovely, smooth green curve in which the water poured over the top and found that one was out on the level river above the Waterfall. The current was racing away behind you, but you were such a wonderful swimmer that you could make headway against it. Soon they were all on the bank, dripping buthappy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看起来最可笑的是狗儿们。一路奔驰时它们压根儿不曾透不过气来，可现在挤在一起，往上扭动，彼此杂乱地谈了许多话，却打了许多喷嚏；那是因为它们老是不断地吠叫，而每次吠叫都弄得满嘴满鼻子都是水。但，吉尔来不及把这些事情充分看仔细，她自己也爬进大瀑布里。这是一种在我们的世界里完全不可能办到的事情。瀑布以那么可怕的重量冲在石头尖上，即使你没有被淹死，也被冲得粉身碎骨了。但是在那个世界里，你倒能办到的。你继续前进，上升再上升，各种来自瀑布的反光照耀在你身上，各式各样的彩色石子又从水中折射出光芒来，这样，看来好像是你正在光芒的本体上往上攀登哩——而且总是愈登愈高，甚至高的感觉会叫你大吃一惊，如果吓得着你的话，但在这儿不过是光荣的兴奋罢了。最后，来到大水由此涌向山顶的那美丽可爱、光滑苍翠的弯道，便发觉自己已身在瀑布上方平坦的河上了。激流在你背后奔腾而去，但你倒是个神奇的游泳健将，竟能逆流而上。不久，他们大家都上了岸，浑身湿淋淋的，可是快快乐乐的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jewel reached the foot of the Waterfall first, but Tirian was only just behind him. Jill was last, so she could see the whole thing better than the others. She saw something white moving steadily up the face of the Waterfall. That white thing was the Unicorn. You couldn't tell whether he was swimming or climbing, but he moved on, higher and higher. The point of his horn divided the water just above his head, and it cascaded out in two rainbow-coloured streams all round his shoulders. Just behind him came King Tirian. He moved his legs and arms as if he were swimming but he moved straight upwards: as if one could swim up the wall of a house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="独角兽珍宝第一个到达大瀑布底下，但蒂莲就跟在它后面。吉尔最后一个到达，所以她比其他的人看得清楚。她看见有个白色的东西在大瀑布的水面上稳稳地移动。白色的东西就是独角兽。你没法儿说它是在游泳还是在攀登，但它是在前进，愈进愈高。它那独角的尖端把那正好在它头顶之上的水分开，水分成两股七彩溪流绕着它的肩膀淌下来。就在独角兽的后面，国王蒂莲也赶到了。他挥动着他的两腿和两臂，仿佛是在游泳，但他是在笔直地向上移动：仿佛他能游上墙壁似的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A long valley opened ahead and great snow-mountains, now much nearer, stood up against the sky.</div>

<div class="line_en">So they ran faster and faster till it was more like flying than running, and even the Eagle overhead was going no faster than they. And they went through winding valley after winding valley and up the steep sides of hills and, faster than ever, down the other side, following the river and sometimes crossing it and skimming across mountainlakes as if they were living speed-boats, till at last at the far end of one long lake which looked as blue as a turquoise, they saw a smooth green hill. Its sides were as steep as the sides of a pyramid and round the very top of it ran a green wall: but above the wall rose the branches of trees whose leaves looked like silver and their fruit like gold.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以他们便愈跑愈快，直跑得不像跑而更像飞了，天空的老鹰也不比他们快了。他们穿过一个弯曲的河谷又穿过一个弯曲的河谷，走上群山的陡坡，比以前更加快速地又走下另一边的陡坡，循着河流走过去，有时渡过河去，漂过高山湖泊去，仿佛他们自己就是有生命的快艇。最后他们到了一个长湖的尽头，湖水蓝得像土耳其玉。于是他们看到了一个光滑的绿色小山。小山的两侧陡得像金字塔的边，环绕山顶四周筑有一道绿色的墙垣，墙上伸展出树枝，树叶看上去像银的，果实像金的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They were out of Narnia now and up into the Western Wild which neither Tirian nor Peter nor even the Eagle had ever seen before. But the Lord Digory and the Lady Polly had.

<div class="line_en">"Further up and further in!" roared the Unicorn, and no one held back. They charged straight at the foot of the hill and then found themselves running up it almost as water from a broken wave runs up a rock out at the point of some bay. Though the slope was nearly as steep as the roof of a house and the grass was smooth as a bowling green, no one slipped. Only when they had reached the very top did they slow up; that was because they found themselves facing great golden gates. And for a moment none of them was bold enough to try if the gates would open. They all felt just as they had felt about the fruit "Dare we? Is it right? Can it be meant for us?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“朝更高更深处前进！”独角兽大声吼道，没有一个人退缩。他们笔直地朝山麓冲去，这就发现他们自己已经奔上山去，几乎就像一个给拦断的波浪，冲上了海湾尖端突出的一块大石头一样。虽然山坡几乎陡得像屋顶，草地光滑得像玩滚木球游戏的草坪，没有一个失足滑倒的。只是他们在到达山顶时放慢了脚步，那是因为他们发现自己面对着巨大的金门。有那么一会儿，谁也不够大胆，不敢去试试金门是否会打开。他们大家的感觉，就像他们对那神奇果实的感觉一模一样——“我们敢吗？对头吗？难道这门能为我们而打开吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

And what came was the last thing he had expected: a little, sleek, bright-eyed Talking Mouse with a red feather stuck in a circlet on its head and its left paw resting on a long sword. It bowed, a most beautiful bow, and said in its shrill voice:</div>

<div class="line_en">It was his own father, the good King Erlian: but not as Tirian had seen him last when they brought him home pale and wounded from his fight with the giant, nor even as Tirian remembered him in his later years when he was a grey-headed warrior. This was his father, young and merry, as he could just remember him from very early days when he himself had been a little boy playing games with his father in the castle garden at Cair Paravel, just before bedtime on summer evenings. The very smell of the bread-and-milk he used to have for supper came back to him.</div>

But before he had had much time to think of this he felt two strong arms thrown about him and felt a bearded kiss on his cheeks and heard a well remembered voice saying: "What, lad? Art thicker and taller since I last touched thee!"</div>

<div class="line_en">Jewel thought to himself, "I will leave them to talk for a little and then I will go and greet the good King Erlian. Many a bright apple has he given me when I was but a colt." But next moment he had something else to think of, for out of the gateway there came a horse so mighty and noble that even a Unicorn might feel shy in its presence: a great winged horse. It looked a moment at the Lord Digory and the Lady Polly and neighed out "What, cousins!" and they both shouted "Fledge! Good old Fledge!" and rushed to kiss it.</div>

So all of them passed in through the golden gates, into the delicious smell that blew towards them out of that garden and into the cool mixture of sunlight and shadow under the trees, walking on springy turf that was all dotted with white flowers. The very first thing which struck everyone was that the place was far larger than it had seemed from outside.

<div class="line_en">Everyone you had ever heard of (if you knew the history of these countries) seemed to be there. There was Glimfeather the Owl and Puddleglum the Marshwiggle, and King Rilian the Disenchanted, and his mother the Star's daughter and his great father Caspian himself. And close beside him were the Lord Drinian and the Lord Berne and Trumpkin the Dwarf and Truffle-hunter the good Badger with Glenstorm the Centaur and a hundred other heroes of the great War of Deliverance. And then from another side came Cor the King of Archenland with King Lune his father and his wife Queen Aravis and the brave prince Corin Thunder-Fist, his brother, and Bree the Horse and Hwin the Mare. And then -- which was a wonder beyond all wonders to Tirian -- there came from further away in the past, the two good Beavers and Tumnus the Faun. And there was greeting and kissing and hand-shaking and old jokes revived, (you've no idea how good an old joke sounds when you take it out again after a rest of five or six hundred years) and the whole company moved forward to the centre of the orchard where the Phoenix sat in a tree and looked down upon them all, and at the foot of that tree were two thrones and in those two thrones a King and Queen so great and beautiful that everyone bowed down before them. And well they might, for these two were King Frank and Queen Helen from whom all the most ancient Kings of Narnia and Archenland are descended. And Tirian felt as you would feel if you were brought before Adam and Eve in all their glory.</div>

Whatever she looked at, however far away it might be, once she had fixed her eyes steadily on it, became quite clear and close as if she were looking through a telescope. She could see the whole Southern desert and beyond it the great city of Tashbaan: to Eastward she could see Cair Paravel on the edge of the sea and the very window of the room that had once been her own. And far out to sea she could discover the islands, islands after islands to the end of the world, and, beyond the end, the huge mountain which they had called Aslan's country. But now she saw that it was part of a great chain of mountains which ringed round the whole world. In front of her it seemed to come quite close. Then she looked to her left and saw what she took to be a great bank of brightly-coloured cloud, cut off from them by a gap. But she looked harder and saw that it was not a cloud at all but a real land. And when she had fixed her eyes on one particular spot of it, she at once cried out, "Peter! Edmund! Come and look! Come quickly." And they came and looked, for their eyes also had become like hers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="露茜东张西望，不久便发现她眼睛发生了新的美丽的变化。不论她瞧什么，不论她瞧的景物多远，一旦她的眼睛稳稳地盯住它直瞧，它就显得很清晰很近，仿佛她是在用望远镜观看。她能看到南方整个儿大沙漠，沙漠后的塔什班城，向东她能望见海滨的凯尔帕拉维尔城，望见一度属于她的那个房间的窗子。远至大海之上，她能发现岛屿，一个岛接着一个岛的，直至天涯海角，而天涯的后面便是人们称之为阿斯兰的国土的崇山峻岭。但现在她看清楚了，这崇山峻岭不过是环绕整个世界的、连绵不断的大山脉的一部分。它就在她的前面，仿佛很近似的。然后她向左边望去，她看到了一大堆她认为是色彩鲜明的云，跟他们之间隔着一条沟。但她更仔细地看时便看出它压根儿不是云，而是一块真正的陆地。当她的眼睛盯住某一点打量时，她立刻大声叫了起来：“彼得！爱德蒙！来瞧瞧！快来。”他们便来瞧了，因为他们的眼也变得跟露茜的眼睛一样了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Suddenly they shifted their eyes to another spot, and then Peter and Edmund and Lucy gasped with amazement and shouted out and began waving: for there they saw their own father and mother, waving back at them across the great, deep valley.

<div class="line_cn" title="突然，他们把眼睛转到了另一个地点，彼得、爱德蒙和露茜这就惊讶得连气也透不过来，他们口中叫了出来，双手也开始挥动起来，因为他们看到了他们的父母，父母也隔着那又大又深的溪谷向他们挥手致意。这就像你看到人们在一条大船的甲板上向你挥手致意，而你正在码头上迎接他们。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That is easy," said Mr Tumnus. "That country and this country -- all the real countries -- are only spurs jutting out from the great mountains of Aslan.

<div class="line_en">And the very first person whom Aslan called to him was Puzzle the Donkey. You never saw a donkey look feebler and sillier than Puzzle did as he walked up to Aslan, and he looked, beside Aslan, as small as a kitten looks beside a St Bernard. The Lion bowed down his head and whispered something to Puzzle at which his long ears went down, but then he said something else at which the ears perked up again. The humans couldn't hear what he had said either time. Then Aslan turned to them and said:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿斯兰首先呼唤的对象是驴子迷惑。驴子向阿斯兰走去，你从未看见过一头驴子像迷惑当时那样虚弱和愚蠢的了：它站在阿斯兰身边，看上去小得就像站在圣·贝尔纳身边的小猫一样。狮王俯下脑袋，在迷惑的耳边低声说了些话，听到这话，迷惑的长耳朵垂下来了；但狮王随即又说了些别的话，听到这话，迷惑的耳朵又竖起来了，几个人都没法儿听到狮王先后两次所说的话。接着，阿斯兰转向人们说道：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And soon they found themselves all walking together and a great, bright procession it was -- up towards mountains higher than you could see in this world even if they were there to be seen. But there was no snow on those mountains: there were forests and green slopes and sweet orchards and flashing waterfalls, one above the other, going up forever. And the land they were walking on grew narrower all the time, with a deep valley on each side: and across that valley the land which was the real England grew nearer and nearer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不久他们就发现大家都走在一起了——好一个伟大而辉煌的行列——都在向上走向比你在这个世界里能看到的高山还要高的崇山峻岭，如果看得到高山的话。但这些崇山峻岭上可没有积雪：有的是森森林木、苍翠山坡、芳香果园和闪烁瀑布，一个接着一个，永远往高处绵延。而他们正在走着的土地始终在愈变愈窄，两边各有一个深谷，深谷那一边的土地，便是真正的英国，愈走愈近啦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The light ahead was growing stronger. Lucy saw that a great series of many-coloured cliffs led up in front of them like a giant's staircase. And then she forgot everything else, because Aslan himself was coming, leaping down from cliff to cliff like a living cataract of power and beauty.</div>

And for us this is the end of all the stories, and we can most truly say that they all lived happily ever after. But for them it was only the beginning of the real story. All their life in this world and all their adventures in Narnia had only been the cover and the title page: now at last they were beginning Chapter One of the Great Story which no one on earth has read: which goes on forever: in which every chapter is better than the one before.</div>
