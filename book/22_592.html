<div class="line_en">Still, it took all that day to reach it. We might have found out the rail-way station and taken a train: but I thought we ought to keep the little money we had left, for food. We walked for a while with a boy who had a great big basket on his back, that he had filled with onions: he showed us to a place where waggons came, to pick up vegetables for the city markets. We had missed the best of the traffic, but we got a ride, in the end, with a man with a slow horse, taking scarlet beans to Hammersmith. He said Charles made him think of his son -- Charles had that sort of face -- so I let them ride up front together, and sat in the back of the cart, with the beans. I sat with my cheek against a crate, my eyes on the road ahead, and now and then the road would rise and show us London again, grown a little nearer. I might have slept; but I couldn't keep from watching.</div>

<div class="line_en">From Hammersmith, we walked. That part of London was strange to me, but I found I knew my way all right -- just as I had known, in the country, which road to take at a fork. Charles walked beside me, blinking, and sometimes catching hold of the cuff of my sleeve; in the end I took his hand to lead him across a street, and he let his fingers stay there. I saw us reflected in the glass of a great shop window -- me in my bonnet, him in his plain pea-jacket -- we looked like the Babes in the bloody Wood.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从海默史密斯开始，我们又步行。伦敦的这些地方于我是陌生的，不过我发现我完全知道该走哪条路——就好象先前在乡下，遇到岔路口，我都知道该走哪条路一样。查尔斯走在我身边，眨巴着眼睛，有时候还抓住我的袖子；最后，我抓住他的手，带他穿过一条街道，他就乖乖地让我抓着手。我在一家大商店的橱窗玻璃反光中看到我们俩——我戴着帽子，他穿着不起眼的粗呢上衣——我们俩活象一对闯进恐怖树林（The Bloody Wood）里的傻宝（Babes）。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When once the cart drew close to the side of a house that was pasted, two inches thick, with fluttering bills, I reached and tore free a strip of poster -- held it for a second, then let it fly. It had a picture of a hand upon it, holding a pistol. It left soot on my fingers. Then I knew I was home.</div>

<div class="line_en">I took him down a dark and narrow street. But then I thought, a dark and narrow street would be the worst kind of street to be caught in. I turned instead -- we were somewhere near Charing Cross now -- into the Strand; and after a time we came to the end of a road that had one or two little stalls, selling second-hand clothes. I went to the first we came to, and bought Charles a woollen scarf. For myself, I got a veil.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我带他走进一条阴暗而狭窄的街道。可随后我想到，要是被逮个正着的话，那么阴暗狭窄的街道就会是最惨的一种。我扭头往回走——我们现在已经在查林十字街附近的地方——没有再往河岸旁走；过了一会儿，我们便走到一条马路的尽头，这里有一两个小摊子，卖二手衣裳的。我走到第一个小摊子跟前，给查尔斯买了一条羊毛围巾。给我自己呢，买了个面纱。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We ought not to cross the water just yet," I said, as we walked on. I was thinking of who we might bump into. Suppose we chanced upon Gentleman? Or, suppose he chanced upon us? I did not think he would put a hand upon me, himself; but fifteen thousand pounds is a deal of money, and I knew he was up to hiring bullies to do his bad work for him. I had not thought of this, until now. I had thought only of reaching London. I began to look about me, in a new way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们暂时不必过河，”我们一面走，我一面说道。我在想我们会忽然撞见谁。试想一下，要是我们不巧撞见绅士？或者，试想一下，他不巧撞见我们？我不觉得他会亲手碰我一根指头；可一万五千镑钱是一笔巨款，我知道他会雇几个坏蛋帮他干坏事。到这会儿，我才想到这个。先前我只想着赶到伦敦。我开始以一种新的眼光环顾四周。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我们在圣保罗教堂门口停住，走了进去，我在长凳上坐下，查尔斯则在教堂里走来走去，盯着那些雕像看。我心想，“我一定要去蓝特街，也只能去蓝特街，到时候我就有救了”；可一想到绅士会在镇子上散布什么样儿的谣言，我又担心得要命。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It looked badly above my bonnet and pale print gown, but I thought I might pass for a girl with scars, or with some kind of ailment of the face. I made Charles draw the woollen scarf about his mouth and pull down his cap. When he complained that the day was hot I said, "If I get taken by Dr Christie's spies before I bring you to Mr Rivers, how hot do you think you'll find it, then?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="面纱衬着我的帽子和灰白衣裳，样子不太好看，不过我觉得，我会被人们当作满脸疤瘌的姑娘，或者脸上有某种疾病。我让查尔斯围上羊毛围巾，遮住嘴巴，再把帽子拉下来。他抱怨天热的时候，我说道，“要是带你找到瑞富斯先生之前，我就被克里斯蒂先生的探子抓住了，你想想到那时候你得感觉多么热？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At Dr Christie's, now, they would be waking us up to take us down to our suppers. We would have breadand-butter, and a pint of tea… Charles came and sat beside me. I heard him sigh. He had his cap in his hands, and his fair hair shone. His lip was perfectly pink. Three boys in white gowns went about with flames on sticks of brass, lighting more lamps and candles; and I looked at him and thought how well he would fit in among them, in a gown of his own.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在克里斯蒂医生那边，这会儿，他们正把我们叫起来，带我们下楼吃晚饭呢。我们会有面包黄油，还有一壶茶…查尔斯过来坐在我身边。我听到他的叹息。他把帽子捏在手里，金黄的头发闪着光。他嘴唇红润。三个身穿白袍子的少年拿着铜蜡烛台，跑来跑去的，四处点灯引火。我望着他，心想他穿着白袍子，也混到他们中间，该多合适啊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Say all of Mr Ibbs's nephews had had their hearts turned against me? Say I met John Vroom before I reached Mrs Sucksby? His heart did not need turning; and he would know me, even behind my veil. I must be careful. I should have to study the house -- make my move only when I knew how the land lay. It was hard, to be cautious and slow; but I thought of my mother, who had not been cautious enough. Look what happened to her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="要是艾伯斯先生的外甥们都调转枪头，一起来对付我，那可如何是好？要是在找到萨克丝贝太太之前，我先遇到约翰。瓦儒，那又如何是好？他可不必调转枪头；就算我戴着面纱，他也认出我。我一定要小心行事。我得先观察一下那幢房子——得看清楚了苗头，再动手。时时警惕，放慢脚步，可真难捱，不过我想起了我母亲，她就是不够小心。瞧她碰到的都是什么事儿。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We crossed the river at Blackfriars, and from there, though I had been going so carefully, I went more carefully still. We kept away from the back lanes and alleys, and stuck to the open roads; and the twilight -- which is a false light, and always a good light for doing any kind of shady business in, better even than darkness -- helped to hide us. Every step we took, however, was taking me closer to home: I began to see certain familiar things -- even, certain familiar people -- and felt, again, a stir in my head and heart, that I thought would quite undo me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们走黑修士桥（Blackfriars）过了河，虽然我已非常谨慎，不过从那儿开始，我一路更加留意了。我们避开小街小巷，一直沿着大路走；黄昏时分——日光微弱，干见不得人的勾当，适得其时，甚至比黑夜（darkness）还合适——正有助于隐藏我们的行踪。然而，我们每跨出一步，都离我家更近一步：我开始看到某些熟悉的事物——甚至于，某些熟悉的人——我头脑和心胸再次激荡一番，我本以为我会无动于衷。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then we reached Gravel Lane and the Southwark Bridge Road, turned up to the west end of Lant Street and stood looking along it; and my blood rushed so fast and my heart rose so high, I thought I should swoon.

I thought I was a fool, after all, to have come so far down the street; then I thought, "Why don't I just make a run at the door, calling out for Mrs Sucksby?" Maybe I'd have done it. I can't say.

<div class="line_en">It was Gentleman. He was wearing that old slouch hat, and had a scarlet cloth at his throat. His hair and whiskers were longer than ever. We watched him saunter. I think he was whistling. Then, at Mr Ibbs's shop-door, he came to a stop. He put his hand to the pocket of his coat and drew out a key. He kicked his feet against the step -- first the right, then the left -- to knock the dust from them; then he fitted the key in the lock, glanced idly about, and went inside. He did it all, in the easiest and most familiar way you can imagine.</div>

<div class="line_en">"We'll have it for the week. I'll give you a shilling now, and pay you the rest tomorrow." She made a face; but she wanted gin, I knew it. "All right," she said. She got to her feet, put the baby on the step, and took us up a slippery staircase.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们要住一个星期。现在我先给你一先令，明天给你剩下的钱。”她撇撇嘴巴；不过我知道，那是她想喝酒了。“好吧，”她说道。她弯下腰，将孩子放在台阶上，领我们上了一段特别容易滑了脚的楼梯。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Got half a one," she said. Half was not enough. We went to the next house, and then the next. They were both full. At last we reached the house right across from Mr Ibbs's. There was a woman on the step with a baby. I did not know her. That was good.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“有半个，”她说道。半个可不够。我们来到隔壁，然后又是隔壁。那两家都客满。最后，我们来到跟艾伯斯先生的店正对门的那户人家。门口台阶上有个女人，手里抱着孩子。我不认识她，倒也正好。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="楼梯平台上有个男人，烂醉如泥了。她领我们进了一个房间，房门上没有锁，只有一块石头撑着才好关门。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="因为我已经一目了然地看到，那窗户上有些小孔，基本上正合我心意；等那个女人拿了我们的钱，走了之后，我关上房门，摘下面纱和帽子，再凑到窗玻璃上，望到外面。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A girl. A girl, very slim at the waist… I saw her, and began to shake. She came on, while Mrs Sucksby moved about the room behind her, taking off her brooches and rings. She came right to the glass. She lifted her arm to rest it upon the bar of the window-sash, and then she stood with her brow upon her wrist, and grew still. Only her fingers moved, as they plucked idly at the lace across the window. Her hand was bare. Her hair was curled. I thought, It can't be her. Then Mrs Sucksby spoke again, the girl lifted her face, the light of the streetlamp fell full upon it; and I cried out loud.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个姑娘。一个姑娘，腰肢非常纤细…我一见她，便开始颤抖。她继续走着，萨克丝贝太太围着她满屋子转，取下她的胸针和指环。她径直走到窗前。她抬起胳膊，将胳膊放在窗格的横栏上，然后站在那儿，额头靠着手腕，人不动了。只有手指头还在动，她手指头无目的地戳着窗户上的布条儿。她手上没戴手套，头发也是卷的。我心想，那才不会是她。这时，萨克丝贝太太又在说话，那姑娘抬起脸来，街灯的光照过来，将她的脸照个正着；于是我大叫一声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the other rooms in the house, people walked, pulled chairs across the floor; a baby cried. A girl -- she was drunk, I suppose -- laughed, on and on. Still I watched. Some clock struck off the hours. I could not hear bells without wincing, now, and felt every one of them: at last came the twelve, and then the half, and I was listening out for the threequarters -- still watching, still waiting; but beginning to wonder, perhaps, what it was I thought I would see -- when this happened: There came a light and a shadow, in Mrs Sucksby's room; and then a figure -- Mrs Sucksby herself! My heart nearly flew into bits. Her hair showed white, and she had her old black taffeta gown on. She stood with a lamp in her hand, her face turned from me, her jaw moving -- she was talking to someone else farther back in the room, someone who now came forward, as she moved back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这幢房子里的其他房间里，人们走来走去，还拖着椅子走；有个婴儿在哇哇大哭。有个姑娘——她喝醉了，我觉得——笑个不停。我仍在观望。有钟声敲响，报送钟点。这会儿听到钟声，我没法儿不心惊肉跳，我清清楚楚地听到每一下钟声：最后到十二点了，接下来是十二点半，我就听着外面的动静，听了三刻钟——一直在观望，一直在守侯。不过或许，我也开始怀疑，原以为能看到些什么事情，可能看不到了。正在这时候，我看到：萨克丝贝太太的房间里出现了一点灯光和一个影子；然后是一个人影——就是萨克丝贝太太本人！我真是肝肠寸断啊！她头发好象都白了，身上穿着那件旧的黑塔夫绸衣裳。她站在那儿，手里提着灯，脸转过去，下巴在动——她在跟房间里的人讲话，有人在她身后，当她朝房中走去时，那人却走上前来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I moved back from the window. My own white face was reflected there, the streetlight striking it -- on the cheek, beneath my eye -- in the shape of a heart. I turned from the glass. My cry had woken Charles, and I suppose my look was peculiar.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我从窗前退开去。我苍白的脸印在窗玻璃上，街灯灯光投射其上——正照见眼睛下面的两颊——照出个心形。我转过身，我的哭声将查尔斯惊醒，我觉得我的样子十分古怪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She might have heard me -- though I don't think she can have -- for she turned her head and seemed to look at me, to hold my gaze across the dusty street and the darkness, for quite a minute.

<div class="line_cn" title="于某种狂热之中，我跑回窗边，望着那幢房子的正面。我说道，“好，我能跳到那边窗户上吗？我能撬开插销，再爬进去，再趁她躺着睡觉，给她一刀。那把刀呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>

I have been dreadfully cheated, and the person that cheated me worst is lying at this moment in my own bed, with my own mother's arms about her. This is a greater thing than you can understand. This is a matter of life and death. I was foolish to say I would kill her tonight. But give me a day or two more, and let me think.

Can you know the wicked trick she played me, and have her here, and not want to throttle her?" I meant it; and yet it sounded like bluster, too. I looked around the room. "Mr Ibbs, can you?" I said.

He reached, out of the circle of lamp-light, and began to struggle, as if to raise himself from the chair. He reached for Charles. "Charley?" he said, the blood bubbling and bursting about the word. He clutched at Charles's coat and made to draw him closer. But Charles would not come. He had stood all this time in the shadows, a look of fixed and awful terror on his face. Now he saw the bubbles at Gentleman's lips and whiskers, Gentleman's red and slippery hand gripping the coarse blue collar of his jacket, and he twitched like a hare. He turned and ran. He ran, the way I had brought him -- along the passage to Mr Ibbs's shop.

<div class="line_en">Mr Ibbs heard him, and ran; but he got no further than that dark little court at the back of the house before a policeman picked him up and brought him back again; and by then, two more policemen had made their way into the kitchen by the shop. They looked at Gentleman, and at the chamber-pot of blood, and -- what we had not thought to look for or to hide -- at the knife, which had got kicked into the shadows and had blood upon it; and they shook their heads. -- As policemen tend to do when they see things like that, in the Borough.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="艾伯斯先生听了他的话，狂奔而去；可是，没等他跑出房后那个阴暗的小院，就被一个警察截住，又给押回来了；这时候，另外两个警察从前面店里过来，进到厨房中。他们看看绅士，又看看那个盛着血的夜壶，还看到——我们都没想到要找出来，或藏起来的——那把刀，不知被谁踢到暗处，上面还有血。他们都摇着头。——这正是警察们在镇子上见到类似场面时，都会有的反应。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But Mrs Sucksby rose from Gentleman's side. Her taffeta dress was soaked in his blood, the brooch of diamonds at her bosom turned to a brooch of rubies. Her hands were crimson, from fingertip to wrist. She looked like the picture of a murderess from one of the penny papers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是萨克丝贝太太却从绅士身旁站起身来。她的塔夫绸衣裳上面，沾得到处都是血，胸前的钻石胸针也变成了红宝石胸针。她一手的血，从手指尖儿到手腕。她的样子，看起来像是小报照片上的女杀人犯。">查看中文翻译</div>
