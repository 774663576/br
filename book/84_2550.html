<div class="line_en">Dad paid me the day before I returned to BYU. He didn't have the money to give what he'd promised, but it was enough to cover the half tuition I owed. I spent my last day in Idaho with Charles. It was a Sunday, but I didn't go to church. I'd had an earache for two days, and during the night it had changed from a dull twinge to a constant sharp stab. I had a fever. My vision was distorted, sensitive to light. That's when Charles called. Did I want to come to his house? I said I couldn't see well enough to drive. He picked me up fifteen minutes later.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="回杨百翰大学的前一天，爸爸付了我工钱。他没有足够的钱兑现之前承诺的薪水，那些钱仅够支付我欠的一半学费。我和查尔斯在爱达荷州度过了最后一天。那是一个星期日，但我没有去教堂。我的耳朵已经疼了两天，到了晚上，从隐隐作痛变成持续的刺痛。我发烧了。我的视力也扭曲了，对光很敏感。这时查尔斯打来电话，问我想不想去他家。我说我视力不太好，不能开车。十五分钟后他来接我。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Charles's house was neat and spacious, with large, bright windows and shiny floors. It reminded me of Grandma-over-in-town's house. I sat on a stool, my head pressed against the cold counter. I heard the creak of a cabinet opening and the pop of a plastic lid. When I opened my eyes, two red pills were on the counter in front of me.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“人们服药止痛，”他说，“这很正常。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I didn't answer. I didn't know what would happen. Mother always said that medical drugs are a special kind of poison, one that never leaves your body but rots you slowly from the inside for the rest of your life. She told me if I took a drug now, even if I didn't have children for a decade, they would be deformed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我没有回答。我不知道会发生什么。母亲总是说，药是一种特殊的毒药，永远不会被排出身体，而且会在余生慢慢地腐蚀你。她告诉我，哪怕我现在吃药，十年后生的孩子也会是畸形。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For as long as I could remember, whenever I was in pain, whether from a cut or a toothache, Mother would make a tincture of lobelia and skullcap. It had never lessened the pain, not one degree. Because of this, I had come to respect pain, even revere it, as necessary and untouchable.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从记事起，只要身体不舒服，无论是有伤口还是牙痛，母亲都会给我服用半边莲和美黄芩制作的酊剂。那从未使疼痛减轻，甚至一点儿作用都没有。正因为如此，我开始尊重疼痛，甚至敬畏它，觉得它必不可少、不可捉摸。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Twenty minutes after I swallowed the red pills, the earache was gone. I couldn't comprehend its absence. I spent the afternoon swinging my head from left to right, trying to jog the pain loose again. I thought if I could shout loudly enough, or move quickly enough, perhaps the earache would return and I would know the medicine had been a sham after all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吞下红色药片二十分钟后，我的耳朵不疼了。我无法理解疼痛的消失。整个下午我左右摆头，试图让疼痛再次出现。我想，如果我喊的声音够大，或者动得够快，也许耳朵还会再痛，我就会知道药其实是一场骗局。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mother was supposed to drive me to BYU the next morning, but during the night, she was called to deliver a baby. There was a car sitting in the driveway -- a Kia Sephia Dad had bought from Tony a few weeks before. The keys were in the ignition. I loaded my stuff into it and drove it to Utah, figuring the car would just about make up for the money Dad owed me. I guess he figured that, too, because he never said a word about it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="母亲本该第二天早上开车送我去杨百翰大学，但晚上她被叫去接生了。车道上停着一辆起亚赛菲亚，是爸爸几周前从托尼那儿买的。钥匙插在点火开关上。我把东西放进车里，开着它去了犹他州，心想这辆车正好能抵掉爸爸欠我的钱。我猜他也想到了这一点，因为他对此并没有说什么。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Charles watched in silence but he must have found my behavior absurd, especially when I began to pull on my ear, which still ached dully, so I could test the limits of this strange witchcraft.</div>

<div class="line_en">I moved into an apartment half a mile from the university. I had new roommates. Robin was tall and athletic, and the first time I saw her she was wearing running shorts that were much too short, but I didn't gape at her. When I met Jenni she was drinking a Diet Coke. I didn't stare at that, either, because I'd seen Charles drink dozens of them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我搬到了离大学半英里远的公寓，有了新室友。罗宾又高又壮，我第一次见她时，她穿着跑步短裤，但我没有对她目瞪口呆。我见到詹妮时，她正在喝健怡可乐。我也没有盯着可乐看，因为我见查尔斯喝过很多次。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Robin was the oldest, and for some reason she was sympathetic to me. Somehow she understood that my missteps came from ignorance, not intention, and she corrected me gently but frankly. She told me exactly what I would need to do, or not do, to get along with the other girls in the apartment. No keeping rotten food in the cupboards or leaving rancid dishes in the sink.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗宾年龄最大，出于某种原因，她很同情我。不知怎的，她明白我的过失并非故意为之，而是出于无知，于是她温和而坦率地纠正我。她告诉我该做什么，不该做什么，要和公寓里的其他女孩好好相处。不要把腐烂的食物放进橱柜，也不要把脏盘子留在水槽里不管。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The next day was the first day of class. Charles had designed my course schedule. He'd signed me up for two music classes and a course on religion, all of which he said would be easy for me. Then he'd enrolled me in two more challenging courses -- college algebra, which terrified me, and biology, which didn't but only because I didn't know what it was.</div>

<div class="line_en">I stopped sleeping. I stayed up late, twisting my hair into knots as I tried to wrest meaning from the textbook, then lying in bed and brooding over my notes. I developed stomach ulcers. Once, Jenni found me curled up on a stranger's lawn, halfway between campus and our apartment. My stomach was on fire; I was shaking with the pain, but I wouldn't let her take me to a hospital. She sat with me for half an hour, then walked me home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我不再睡觉，每天都熬到很晚，揪着头发对着课本苦思冥想，之后躺在床上钻研笔记。我得了胃溃疡。一次，詹妮发现我蜷着身子躺在学校和公寓之间一户陌生人家的草坪上。我的胃着火一般，疼得浑身发抖，但我拒绝让她送我去医院。她陪我坐了半个小时，然后送我回到公寓。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Algebra threatened to put an end to my scholarship. The professor spent every lecture muttering inaudibly as he paced in front of the chalkboard. I wasn't the only one who was lost, but I was more lost than anyone else. Charles tried to help, but he was starting his senior year of high school and had his own schoolwork. In October I took the midterm and failed it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="代数课是终止我的奖学金的一大威胁。教授每次上课都在黑板前踱来踱去，咕咕哝哝让人听不清。我不是唯一感到迷茫的人，但我比任何人都更迷茫。查尔斯试图帮忙，他刚开始高中最后一年的学习，有自己的学业。十月，我参加了期中考试，但没有及格。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The pain in my stomach intensified, burning through the night, making it impossible to sleep. I needed money for rent, so I got a job as a janitor for the engineering building. My shift began every morning at four. Between the ulcers and the janitorial work, I barely slept. Jenni and Robin kept saying I should see a doctor but I didn't. I told them I was going home for Thanksgiving and that my mother would cure me. They exchanged nervous glances but didn't say anything.</div>

<div class="line_en">I knocked on his office door a few days before Thanksgiving. He looked smaller in his office than he did in the lecture hall, and more shiny: the light above his desk reflected off his head and glasses. He was shuffling through the papers on his desk, and he didn't look up when I sat down. "If I fail this class," I said, "I'll lose my scholarship." I didn't explain that without a scholarship, I couldn't come back.</div>

<div class="line_en">I didn't know what he meant by "transfer," so I said nothing. I stood to go, and for some reason this softened him. "Truthfully," he said, "a lot of people are failing."

I'll announce in class that anyone who gets a perfect score on the final -- not a ninety-eight but an actual one hundred -- will get an A, no matter how they performed on the midterm.
