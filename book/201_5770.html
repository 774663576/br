<div class="line_en">A much smaller and warmer hand had enclosed his and was pulling him upward. He obeyed its pressure without really thinking about it. Only as he walked blindly back through the crowd did he realize, from a trace of flowery scent on the air, that it was Ginny who was leading him back into the castle. Incomprehensible voices battered him, sobs and shouts and wails stabbed the night, but Harry and Ginny walked on, back up the steps into the entrance hall. Faces swam on the edges of Harry's vision, people were peering at him, whispering, wondering, and Gryffindor rubies glistened on the floor like drops of blood as they made their way toward the marble staircase.</div>

Ron, Hermione, Luna, Tonks, and Lupin were gathered around another bed near the far end of the ward. At the sound of the doors opening, they all looked up. Hermione ran to Harry and hugged him; Lupin moved forward too, looking anxious.</div>

<div class="line_en">Nobody answered. Harry looked over Hermione's shoulder and saw an unrecognizable face lying on Bill's pillow, so badly slashed and ripped that he looked grotesque.

<div class="line_en">"No, I don't think that Bill will be a true werewolf," said Lupin, "but that does not mean that there won't be some contamination. Those are cursed wounds. They are unlikely ever to heal fully, and -- and Bill might have some wolfish characteristics from now on."</div>

Lupin looked wildly from Ginny to Harry, as though hoping the latter might contradict her, but when Harry did nor, Lupin collapsed into a chair beside Bill's bed, his hands over his face.

He turned away and caught Ron's eye instead, exchanging in silence a look that confirmed what Ginny had said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不可能！”卢平狂乱地把目光从金妮转向了哈利，希望他能否认，但哈利没有，卢平瘫坐在比尔床边的椅子上，双手捂着脸。哈利从没见卢平失控过。哈利觉得自己好像看到了什么不体面的隐私，他转过身，却撞到了罗恩的目光。他们默默地交换了眼神，证实了金妮所说的话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Snape killed him," said Harry. "I was there, I saw it.

Somewhere out in the darkness, a phoenix was singing in a way Harry had never heard before: a stricken lament of terrible beauty.

<div class="line_cn" title="庞弗雷夫人用手捂住嘴，咽着泪水，眼睛睁得大大的。在外面黑暗中的某个地方，凤凰正在用哈利从未听过的方式唱着令人动容的凄婉挽歌。像以前听凤凰的歌声一样，哈利感觉到这首挽歌的曲子是在他的脑海里，而不是在现实中，仿佛是他自己的悲伤化作了挽歌，在校园里和城堡的窗户间回荡。">查看中文翻译</div>

Like all the rest, she bore marks of the recent battle: There were grazes on her face and her robes were ripped.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利不知道他们站在那里听了多久，也不知道为什么他们听着这哀悼之歌会有一丝安慰，只感觉过了很久，麦格教授才推门走进病房。同其他人一样，她身上也有战斗后的痕迹，脸上有些许擦伤，长袍也被撕破了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry stood up, murmured "See you in a bit" to Ron, Hermione, and Ginny, and followed Professor McGonagall back down the ward. The corridors outside were deserted and the only sound was the distant phoenix song. It was several minutes before Harry became aware that they were not heading for Professor McGonagall's office, but for Dumbledore's, and another few seconds before he realized that of course, she had been deputy headmistress,… Apparently she was now headmistress… so the room behind the gargoyle was now hers.</div>

<div class="line_en">In silence they ascended the moving spiral staircase and entered the circular office. He did not know what he had expected: that the room would be draped in black, perhaps, or even that Dumbledore's body might be lying there. In fact, it looked almost exactly as it had done when he and Dumbledore had left it mere hours previously: the silver instruments whirring and puffing on their spindle legged tables, Gryffindor's sword in its glass case gleaming in the moonlight, the Sorting Hat on a shelf behind the desk, the Fawkes's perch stood empty, he was still crying his lament to the grounds. And a new portrait had joined the ranks of the dead headmasters and headmistresses of Hogwarts: Dumbledore was slumbering in a golden frame over the desk, his half-moon spectacle perched upon his crooked nose, looking peaceful and untroubled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们一声不响地登上螺旋形楼梯，走进了圆形的办公室。他不知道自己以为会看到什么：也许房间里挂着黑纱，甚至邓布利多的遗体也停放在那里。可事实却是，办公室里的一切同他和邓布利多几个小时前离开时一模一样：银制的仪器在细腿桌子上嗡嗡旋转，喷吐着烟雾，玻璃匣中格兰芬多的宝剑在月光下闪闪发光，分院帽仍在桌子后面的架子上。但是福克斯的栖木空了，那凤凰仍在场地上哀唱挽歌。一幅新的肖像已经加入霍格沃茨学院已故校长们的行列……邓布利多沉睡在桌子上方的一个金色的相框里，半月形的眼镜架在他的鹰钩鼻上，看上去安详而宁静。">查看中文翻译</div>
