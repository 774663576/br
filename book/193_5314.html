<div class="line_en">Nearly asphyxiated by fumes, Langdon struggled up the ladder toward the light at the top of the pit. Above him he heard voices, but nothing was making sense. His head was spinning with images of the branded cardinal.</div>

<div class="line_en">As he pushed upward, his vision narrowed and he feared consciousness would slip away. Two rungs from the top, his balance faltered. He lunged upward trying to find the lip, but it was too far. He lost his grip on the ladder and almost tumbled backward into the dark. There was a sharp pain under his arms, and suddenly Langdon was airborne, legs swinging wildly out over the chasm.</div>

<div class="line_en">For a moment, Langdon was unsure where he was. Overhead he saw stars… orbiting planets. Hazy figures raced past him. People were shouting. He tried to sit up. He was lying at the base of a stone pyramid. The familiar bite of an angry tongue echoed inside the chapel, and then Langdon knew.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一时之间，兰登不确定自己身在何处。他看到头顶上的星星……环绕轨道运行的行星。朦胧的人影在他身边迅速掠过。一堆人在喊。他想坐起来。他躺在一个岩石金字塔的底部。一种熟悉的愤怒语调在圣堂内迴盪，然后兰登明白了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The strong hands of two Swiss Guards hooked him under the armpits and dragged him skyward. A moment later Langdon's head emerged from the Demon's hole, choking and gasping for air.

<div class="line_en">Langdon steadied himself against the wall and gazed up at the enormous pyramid sculptures. Vittoria was dead right. Ifthis chapel was the first altar of science, it might still contain the Illuminati sculpture that served as the first marker. Langdon felt an electrifying rush of hope to realize there was still a chance. If the marker were indeed here, and they could follow it to the next altar of science, they might have another chance to catch the killer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登靠墙稳住自己，抬头望著那两根巨大的金字塔雕柱。薇多利雅说得一点也没错。如果这个小圣堂是第一个科学祭坛，那么裡头可能还会有当作第一个指标的光明会雕像。兰登觉得一股充满希望的兴奋感涌上来，明白自己还有机会。如果第一个指标确实在这裡，他们可以循著指标到下一个科学祭坛，或许还有另一个机会抓到那个杀手。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Suddenly Langdon was staggering to his feet. He turned dizzying circles, staring at the artwork around him. Pyramids, stars, planets, ellipses. Suddenly everything came back. This is the first altar of science! Not the Pantheon! It dawned on him now how perfectly Illuminati the chapel was, far more subtle and selective than the world famous Pantheon. The Chigi was an out of the way alcove, a literal hole-in-the-wall, a tribute to a great patron of science, decorated with earthly symbology. Perfect.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登突然挣扎著站起来。他头昏昏地转著圈子，瞪著四周的艺术作品。金字塔、星星、行星、椭圆形。忽然间他完全回复清醒了。这是第一个科学祭坛！不是万神殿！他现在才确切明白，这个小圣堂有多么接近光明会的精神，远比举世知名的万神殿要更隐讳、更精心挑选过。基吉小圣堂是个偏僻的凹室，实际上只是墙上的一个壁龛，是对一个伟大科学赞助人的致敬物，以世俗的象徵符号装饰。太完美了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="「不，」兰登说：「跟伽利略完全不一样。伽利略是教会背上的一根刺，贝尼尼则是梵蒂冈的宠儿。教会爱贝尼尼，他是梵蒂冈各方面的艺术权威，而且几乎一辈子就住在梵蒂冈城裡！」">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Langdon immediately knew she was mistaken. Bernini was an impossibility. Gianlorenzo Bernini was the second most famous sculptor of all time, his fame eclipsed only by Michelangelo himself. During the 1600s Bernini created more sculptures than any other artist. Unfortunately, the man they were looking for was supposedly an unknown, a nobody.</div>

It was the cornerstone of their ability to stay secret… very few knew the whole story.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登还是不太相信，却承认薇多利雅的逻辑有那么点奇怪的道理。光明会的分层保密是出了名的，只有高阶会员才能得知某些真相。这是让他们维持隐祕状态的基础……只有极少数人晓得全盘内情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, unknown tothem. Think of the secrecy of the Masons -- only the upper -- echelon members knew the whole truth. Galileo could have kept Bernini's true identity secret from most members… for Bernini's own safety. That way, the Vatican would never find out."</div>

<div class="line_en">Langdon read the plaque twice, and still he was not convinced. Gianlorenzo Bernini was celebrated for his intricate, holy sculptures of the Virgin Mary, angels, prophets, Popes. What was he doing carvingpyramids?</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="基吉小圣堂的艺术作品">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Langdon looked up at the towering monuments and felt totally disoriented. Two pyramids, each with a shining, elliptical medallion. They were about as un-Christian as sculpture could get. The pyramids, the stars above, the signs of the Zodiac. All interior adornments are those of Gianlorenzo Bernini. If that were true, Langdon realized, it meant Vittoriahad to be right. By default, Bernini was the Illuminati's unknown master; nobody else had contributed artwork to this chapel! The implications came almost too fast for Langdon to process.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登抬头望著那两座高耸的纪念碑，觉得完全茫然了。两座金字塔，上头各顶著一个有星星的椭圆形纹章。这两座雕塑真是反基督教到极点。金字塔、屋顶的星星、黄道十二宫的符号。所有室内装饰均为吉昂洛伦佐．贝尼尼之作品。兰登明白，如果这些真是贝尼尼的作品，那就表示薇多利雅的推论一定没错。因为会员身分保密，贝尼尼就成了光明会的匿名大师；这个小圣堂没有其他人的艺术作品！背后的种种含意纷至踏来，快得兰登来不及消化。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="兰登思索著。他看著那两座金字塔，纳闷其中之一会不会就是那个指标。或许两座金字塔都是？「两座金字塔刚好面对著相反方向，」兰登说，不晓得该如何是好，「可是两座都一模一样，所以我不晓得哪个……」">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Langdon followed the line of her hand to the far wall. At first he saw nothing. Then someone moved and he caught a glimpse. White marble. An arm. A torso. And then a sculpted face. Partially hidden in its niche. Two life-size human figures intertwined. Langdon's pulse accelerated. He had been so taken with the pyramids and demon's hole, he had not even seen this sculpture. He moved across the room, through the crowd. As he drew near, Langdon recognized the work was pure Bernini -- the intensity of the artistic composition, the intricate faces and flowing clothing, all from the purest white marble Vatican money could buy. It was not until he was almost directly in front of it that Langdon recognized the sculpture itself. He stared up at the two faces and gasped.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登顺著她的手所指的方向，朝对面的墙望去。一开始他什么都没看到。然后有人挪动了位置，他瞥见了一眼。白色大理石，一隻手臂，一个身躯，然后是雕塑的脸，半藏在壁龛裡，两个真人大小的人形在一起。兰登的脉搏加速，之前他的注意力被金字塔和恶魔洞佔据了，连这座雕像都没看到。他穿过房间，经过拥挤的人群。靠近时，兰登认出了那件作品完全是贝尼尼的风格──紧凑的艺术佈局，复杂的面部表情，以及流动的衣褶，全都以梵蒂冈所能买到最纯白的大理石所构成。兰登几乎是到了那座雕塑面前，才认出是什么作品。他张大嘴巴盯著那两张脸。">查看中文翻译</div>

Both the angel and Habakkuk had their arms outstretched and were pointing into the distance.</div>
