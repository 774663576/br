<div class="line_en">They were just approaching the house where lived Mrs. and Miss Bates. She determined to call upon them and seek safety in numbers. There was always sufficient reason for such an attention; Mrs. and Miss Bates loved to be called on, and she knew she was considered by the very few who presumed ever to see imperfection in her, as rather negligent in that respect, and as not contributing what she ought to the stock of their scanty comforts.</div>

<div class="line_en">She had had many a hint from Mr. Knightley and some from her own heart, as to her deficiency -- but none were equal to counteract the persuasion of its being very disagreeable,-- a waste of time -- tiresome women -- and all the horror of being in danger of falling in with the second-rate and third-rate of Highbury, who were calling on them for ever, and therefore she seldom went near them. But now she made the sudden resolution of not passing their door without going in -- observing, as she proposed it to Harriet, that, as well as she could calculate, they were just now quite safe from any letter from Jane Fairfax.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对于她的缺点，奈特利先生多次提醒过她，她自己心里也时而有所觉察，但这都不足于抵消这样一个想法：去看望这母女俩是很不愉快的事，是浪费时间，她们俩令人讨厌罢了，更令人可怕的是，还会碰到海伯里一些二三流的人，这种人总往她们家里跑，因此她很少去接近那母女俩。可是眼下她突然打定主意，不能过门而不入——她对哈丽特提出这一建议时，说照她的估计，简—费尔法克斯最近不会有信来，她们可以尽管放心去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Emma and Harriet had been walking together one morning, and, in Emma's opinion, had been talking enough of Mr. Elton for that day. She could not think that Harriet's solace or her own sins required more; and she was therefore industriously getting rid of the subject as they returned; -- but it burst out again when she thought she had succeeded, and after speaking some time of what the poor must suffer in winter, and receiving no other answer than a very plaintive -- "Mr. Elton is so good to the poor!" she found something else must be done.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天早上，爱玛和哈丽特在一起散步。爱玛觉得，这一天她们谈论埃尔顿先生已经谈够了。她认为无论是为了安慰哈丽特，还是为了忏悔她自己的罪过，都不需要再多谈了。所以，在回家的路上，她极力回避这个话题。可是，她刚以为她回避成功了，这个话题重又冒了出来。她说了一阵穷人冬天一定很苦的话，只听哈丽特十分悲哀地回了一声：“埃尔顿先生对穷人真好！”爱玛意识到只得另想个办法。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The mention of the Coles was sure to be followed by that of Mr. Elton. There was intimacy between them, and Mr. Cole had heard from Mr. Elton since his going away. Emma knew what was coming; they must have the letter over again, and settle how long he had been gone, and how much he was engaged in company, and what a favourite he was wherever he went, and how full the Master of the Ceremonies' ball had been; and she went through it very well, with all the interest and all the commendation that could be requisite, and always putting forward to prevent Harriet's being obliged to say a word.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一提起科尔家的人，紧跟着势必要提起埃尔顿先生。他们彼此关系密切，埃尔顿先生走后还给科尔先生来过信。爱玛知道下面要怎么办了。她们一定会再谈起那封信，算算他走了多久，猜想他怎样忙于应酬，走到哪里都如何受人喜爱，典礼官的舞会如何热闹。爱玛对此应付自如，怀着必要的兴趣，做了必要的赞许，而且总是抢在前面，免得哈丽特不得不说一两句。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The house belonged to people in business. Mrs. and Miss Bates occupied the drawing-room floor; and there, in the very moderate-sized apartment, which was every thing to them, the visitors were most cordially and even gratefully welcomed; the quiet neat old lady, who with her knitting was seated in the warmest corner, wanting even to give up her place to Miss Woodhouse, and her more active, talking daughter, almost ready to overpower them with care and kindness, thanks for their visit, solicitude for their shoes, anxious inquiries after Mr. Woodhouse's health, cheerful communications about her mother's, and sweet-cake from the beaufet --"Mrs. Cole had just been there, just called in for ten minutes, and had been so good as to sit an hour with them, and she had taken a piece of cake and been so kind as to say she liked it very much; and, therefore, she hoped Miss Woodhouse and Miss Smith would do them the favour to eat a piece too."</div>

Whenever she is with us, Mrs. Cole does not know how to shew her kindness enough; and I must say that Jane deserves it as much as any body can. And so she began inquiring after her directly, saying, `I know you cannot have heard from Jane lately, because it is not her time for writing;' and when I immediately said, `But indeed we have, we had a letter this very morning,' I do not know that I ever saw any body more surprized. `Have you, upon your honour?' said she; `well, that is quite unexpected.

<div class="line_en">"Thank you. You are so kind!" replied the happily deceived aunt, while eagerly hunting for the letter.--"Oh! here it is. I was sure it could not be far off; but I had put my huswife upon it, you see, without being aware, and so it was quite hid, but I had it in my hand so very lately that I was almost sure it must be on the table. I was reading it to Mrs. Cole, and since she went away, I was reading it again to my mother, for it is such a pleasure to her -- a letter from Jane -- that she can never hear it often enough; so I knew it could not be far off, and here it is, only just under my huswife -- and since you are so kind as to wish to hear what she says;-- but, first of all, I really must, in justice to Jane, apologise for her writing so short a letter -- only two pages you see -- hardly two -- and in general she fills the whole paper and crosses half. My mother often wonders that I can make it out so well. She often says, when the letter is first opened, `Well, Hetty, now I think you will be put to it to make out all that checker-work'-- don't you, ma'am?-- And then I tell her, I am sure she would contrive to make it out herself, if she had nobody to do it for her -- every word of it -- I am sure she would pore over it till she had made out every word. And, indeed, though my mother's eyes are not so good as they were, she can see amazingly well still, thank God! with the help of spectacles. It is such a blessing! My mother's are really very good indeed. Jane often says, when she is here, `I am sure, grandmama, you must have had very strong eyes to see as you do -- and so much fine work as you have done too!-- I only wish my eyes may last me as well.'"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“谢谢。你真是太好了！”当姨妈的信以为真，兴高采烈，一边急急忙忙找信，一边回答说。“哦！在这儿。我知道就在手边嘛。可是你瞧，我没留意把针线盒放在上面了，把信给盖住了。不过我刚才还拿在手里，因此我几乎可以肯定，一定放在桌上。我先是念给科尔太太听，科尔太太走了以后，我又念给我妈妈听，因为简一来信她就高兴，听多少次都听不厌。所以我知道这信就在手边，这不是嘛，就在针线盒下面——承蒙你关心，想听听简说了些什么，可为了对简公正起见，首先我真得为她写丁这么封短信表示歉意——你瞧只有两页——几乎连两页都不到——她一般是写满一张信纸，再把信纸翻过来交叉着写上半张。妈妈总觉得奇怪，我怎么能看得这么清楚。每次一打开信，她总说：‘唉，赫蒂，我看你又要费劲地辨认那方格式的玩意儿了。’是吧，妈妈？然后我就对她说，如果没有人替她念，我相信她自己一定能认出来——认出每个字——我相信她会盯着信仔细看，直至把每个字都看清楚。说真的，尽管我妈妈的眼睛不像以前那么好了，但是感谢上帝，她戴着眼镜还能看得很清楚，真令人惊奇！这是她的福气呀！我妈妈的眼睛确实很好。简在这儿的时候常说：‘外婆，你现在看东西这么清楚，我相信你以前的眼睛一定很好——你还能做那么细的活儿！但愿以后我的眼睛也像你那样就好了。”’">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"My mother's deafness is very trifling you see -- just nothing at all. By only raising my voice, and saying any thing two or three times over, she is sure to hear; but then she is used to my voice. But it is very remarkable that she should always hear Jane better than she does me. Jane speaks so distinct! However, she will not find her grandmama at all deafer than she was two years ago; which is saying a great deal at my mother's time of life -- and it really is full two years, you know, since she was here. We never were so long without seeing her before, and as I was telling Mrs. Cole, we shall hardly know how to make enough of her now."</div>

<div class="line_en">"So obliging of you! No, we should not have heard, if it had not been for this particular circumstance, of her being to come here so soon. My mother is so delighted!-- for she is to be three months with us at least. Three months, she says so, positively, as I am going to have the pleasure of reading to you. The case is, you see, that the Campbells are going to Ireland. Mrs. Dixon has persuaded her father and mother to come over and see her directly. They had not intended to go over till the summer, but she is so impatient to see them again -- for till she married, last October, she was never away from them so much as a week, which must make it very strange to be in different kingdoms, I was going to say, but however different countries, and so she wrote a very urgent letter to her mother -- or her father, I declare I do not know which it was, but we shall see presently in Jane's letter -- wrote in Mr. Dixon's name as well as her own, to press their coming over directly, and they would give them the meeting in Dublin, and take them back to their country seat, Baly-craig, a beautiful place, I fancy. Jane has heard a great deal of its beauty; from Mr. Dixon, I mean -- I do not know that she ever heard about it from any body else; but it was very natural, you know, that he should like to speak of his own place while he was paying his addresses -- and as Jane used to be very often walking out with them -- for Colonel and Mrs. Campbell were very particular about their daughter's not walking out often with only Mr. Dixon, for which I do not at all blame them; of course she heard every thing he might be telling Miss Campbell about his own home in Ireland; and I think she wrote us word that he had shewn them some drawings of the place, views that he had taken himself. He is a most amiable, charming young man, I believe. Jane was quite longing to go to Ireland, from his account of things."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你真是太好啦！是呀，要不是出现了特殊情况，我们是不会听到她马上要来的消息的。我妈妈高兴极了！因为她至少要在我们这里住上三个月。三个月，她信上说得很明确，我可以马上念给你听。你知道，事情是这样的：坎贝尔夫妇要去爱尔兰。迪克逊夫人劝说她父母马上去看看她。那做父母的本来打算到了夏天再去，可是迪克逊夫人迫不及待地要再见到他们——她在去年十月结婚以前，从来没有离开过他们一个星期，因此分住在不同的王国就会感到很不自在。我原想说不同的王国，不过还是说不同的地区为好。所以她写了一封十分急迫的信给她妈妈——也许是给她爸爸，我声明我不知道究竟是写给谁的，不过我们马上会从简的信中看个分明——她信里用她自己和迪克逊先生的名义，恳请他们马上就去。他们在都柏林接他们，然后带他们去他们的乡间住宅巴利克莱格，我想那地方一定很美。简经常听人说起那地方有多美，我是指听迪克逊先生说的——我知道别人是不会对她说这事的。不过你知道，迪克逊先生向她求爱的时候，自然而然是要夸自己的家的…而且简经常和他们一起出去散步…因为坎贝尔上校夫妇管得很严，不许女儿常和迪克逊先生单独出去散步，我看这也不能怪他们。不用说，迪克逊先生向坎贝尔小姐夸他爱尔兰老家的话，简肯定都听到了。简在信里告诉我们说，迪克逊先生给她们看过他家乡的一些素描，那都是他自己画的。我相信，他是个极其可爱、极其迷人的青年。听到他的描述，简眼巴巴地就想去爱尔兰。”">查看中文翻译</div>

The very thing that we have always been rather afraid of; for we should not have liked to have her at such a distance from us, for months together -- not able to come if any thing was to happen.

They want her (Mr. and Mrs. Dixon) excessively to come over with Colonel and Mrs. Campbell; quite depend upon it; nothing can be more kind or pressing than their joint invitation, Jane says, as you will hear presently; Mr. Dixon does not seem in the least backward in any attention. He is a most charming young man. Ever since the service he rendered Jane at Weymouth, when they were out in that party on the water, and she, by the sudden whirling round of something or other among the sails, would have been dashed into the sea at once, and actually was all but gone, if he had not, with the greatest presence of mind, caught hold of her habit -- (I can never think of it without trembling!)-- But ever since we had the history of that day, I have been so fond of Mr. Dixon!"</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“是的——完全是她自己的决定，完全是她自己的选择。坎贝尔上校夫妇认为她做得很对，他们本来也正想劝她这样做。说真的，他们特别想让她呼吸一下家乡的空气，因为她近来身体不如往常好。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Jane caught a bad cold, poor thing! so long ago as the 7th of November, (as I am going to read to you,) and has never been well since. A long time, is not it, for a cold to hang upon her? She never mentioned it before, because she would not alarm us. Just like her! so considerate!-- But however, she is so far from well, that her kind friends the Campbells think she had better come home, and try an air that always agrees with her; and they have no doubt that three or four months at Highbury will entirely cure her -- and it is certainly a great deal better that she should come here, than go to Ireland, if she is unwell. Nobody could nurse her, as we should do."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“简这可怜的东西！早在十一月七日那天就得了重感冒（我马上念给你听），从那天起就一直没好过。她得的是感冒，拖的时间是不是太长了？她一直没有提起过，就怕我们着急。她就是这样！这么体贴人！不过，她身体很不好，她好心的朋友坎贝尔夫妇认为她最好还是回家去，呼吸呼吸一向对她很合适的空气。他们相信，在海伯里住上三四个月，她就定会痊愈——她既然身体不好，来这儿当然要比去爱尔兰好得多。要是去爱尔兰，就没有人像我们这样护理她。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"And so she is to come to us next Friday or Saturday, and the Campbells leave town in their way to Holyhead the Monday following -- as you will find from Jane's letter. So sudden!-- You may guess, dear Miss Woodhouse, what a flurry it has thrown me in! If it was not for the drawback of her illness -- but I am afraid we must expect to see her grown thin, and looking very poorly. I must tell you what an unlucky thing happened to me, as to that. I always make a point of reading Jane's letters through to myself first, before I read them aloud to my mother, you know, for fear of there being any thing in them to distress her. Jane desired me to do it, so I always do: and so I began to-day with my usual caution; but no sooner did I come to the mention of her being unwell, than I burst out, quite frightened, with `Bless me! poor Jane is ill!'-- which my mother, being on the watch, heard distinctly, and was sadly alarmed at. However, when I read on, I found it was not near so bad as I had fancied at first; and I make so light of it now to her, that she does not think much about it. But I cannot imagine how I could be so off my guard. If Jane does not get well soon, we will call in Mr. Perry. The expense shall not be thought of; and though he is so liberal, and so fond of Jane that I dare say he would not mean to charge any thing for attendance, we could not suffer it to be so, you know. He has a wife and family to maintain, and is not to be giving away his time. Well, now I have just given you a hint of what Jane writes about, we will turn to her letter, and I am sure she tells her own story a great deal better than I can tell it for her."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“所以，她下星期五或星期六就来到我们这儿啦，再下星期一坎贝尔夫妇动身去霍利赫德——你从简的信里可以了解到。这么突然！亲爱的伍德豪斯小姐，你可以想象我有多么激动啊！要不是简在生病——恐怕她看上去一定又黄又瘦。说到这儿，我得告诉你我做了一件很遗憾的事。你知道，每次简来信，我总是先自己看一遍，然后再念给我妈妈听，就怕信里有什么东西惹她难过。简要我这么做，所以我总是这么做。今天一开始我也像往常一样小心，后来看到简身体不好，我吓了一跳，便嚷了起来：‘天哪！可怜的简病了！’我妈妈当时正留着神儿，听得清清楚楚，心里不禁十分担忧。不过，我再往下念时，发现病情并不像我起先想象的那么重。于是我就不把她的病当做一回事，我妈妈也不把这件事放在心上了。可我怎么也想不通，我怎么会这么疏忽大意！要是简不能马上复原，我们就去请佩里先生。费用不必考虑。佩里先生为人慷慨，又很喜欢简，也许不会收钱，但是我们可不能容许他不收，这你知道的。他要养活老婆孩子，不能白白耗费时间。好啦，我已经简单地提了提信里的内容，现在就来看看信吧。我敢说，她那些事儿听她讲，一定比我讲的清楚得多。”">查看中文翻译</div>
