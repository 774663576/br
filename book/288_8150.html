<div class="line_en">We left Oxford on the third day, to go back home. The weather changed, and, when we left Oxford, it was raining. It continued to rain, not heavily, but all the time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第三天，我们从牛津启航回家。离开牛津的时候，天气变了，下起了雨。从那以后，雨一直在下，虽然不大，可却始终没有停过。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It rained all day, and, at first, we pretended we were enjoying it. We said that it was a nice change. We added that it was good to see the river in all kinds of weather. Harris and I sang a song about how good it was to be free and to be able to enjoy the sun and the rain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="整天下着雨。起初，我们还装出一副怡然自得的样子。我们说换换口味也好，我们喜欢看不同天气下的河流是什么样子。哈里斯和我唱着歌，唱着自由多么美好，享受完了阳光享受小雨是多么美妙。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The rain came down without stopping. Everything in the boat was wet. Supper was not a success. We were all tired of cold meat, and we talked about our favourite foods. When we passed the cold meat to Montmorency, he refused our offer. He went and sat at the other end of the boat, alone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雨下个不停，船上的东西全部都淋湿了，晚餐自然是个失败。大家对冷肉都倒了胃口，便说起各自喜欢的食物。我们把冷肉递给“元帅”，它才不要呢。它走过去坐在船尾，孤零零地。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When the sun is shining, the river turns everything into a golden dream. But when it rains, the river is brown and miserable.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阳光灿烂的日子里，河水把一切都变成了金色的梦；可是天一下雨，河水变得浑浊而凄凉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Before lunch, he put the cover on the boat, and it stayed there all afternoon. We just left a little hole, so that we could see out. We stopped for the night, just before Day's lock, and I cannot say that we spent a happy evening.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="午餐之前，他挂起了篷布，整整挂了一下午。我们只留出一个孔，可以看到外面。在不到戴斯水闸的地方，我们停船过夜。我得说那个晚上我们实在没有过好。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After that we had some whisky, and we sat and talked. George told us about a man he had known. This man had slept on the river, in a wet boat, like ours, and it had made him very ill. Ten days later, the poor man died, in great pain. George said he was quite a young man, so it was very sad.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="之后，我们又喝了些威士忌，坐下来聊天。乔治跟我们谈起他认识的一个人，也曾睡在河上一只潮湿的船里，象我们的一样。结果，得了重病，十天后就在难以忍受的病痛中死去。乔治说他还是个年轻人，一想起来就伤心。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then Harris remembered one of his friends who had camped out on a wet night. When he woke up the next morning, he was in great pain, and he was never able to walk again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着，哈里斯也想起他的一个朋友在潮湿的夜里，在野外露营。第二天早上一觉醒来，发现自己痛楚难当，然后再也不会走路了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So then, of course, we began to talk about other illnesses. Harris said it would be very serious if one of us became ill because we were a long way from a doctor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="既然如此，我们又很自然地谈起了其它各种病症。哈里斯说，如果我们有人得了病那可麻烦了，因为我们离医生可远着呐！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We played cards after supper. We played for about an hour and a half, and George won ten pence. Harris and I lost five pence each. We decided to stop then, because the game was getting too exciting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吃完晚饭，我们一起玩起了纸牌。玩了约摸有一个半小时，乔治赢了十个便士，我和哈里斯每人输了五个。我们觉得不能再玩了，因为我们已经赌得有点情绪激动了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After that we could think of nothing else to do, so we went to bed. Well…we undressed and we lay down in the boat. We tried to go to sleep but it was four hours before we did so. At five o'clock we all woke up again, so we got up and had breakfast.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="再后来，我们想不起还有什么事好做，所以就去睡觉了。于是，我们脱了衣服，躺在船里。我们想合眼就睡，可足足有四个小时才迷糊着了。早晨五点，大家又全醒了。于是就起床，吃早饭。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After this we really needed something to make us feel a bit happier, so George sang to us. That really made us cry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="谈了这么多丧气话，我们真需要点东西提提精神，放松放松。所以乔治给我们唱歌听，可那歌唱得我们抱头痛哭。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The second day was the same as the first. It rained all day. We sat in our raincoats under the cover, and we travelled slowly along the river. I did try to sing again, but it was not a success.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天的天气，依然如故，雨下了一整天。我们裹着雨衣，坐在篷布底下，沿着河慢慢地漂。我还试着再唱支歌，可实在唱不下去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'It's only two more days,'Harris said, 'and we are young and strong. Perhaps we'll be all right. '</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“又是幸福的一夜，”乔治说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At about four o'clock we began to discuss our plans for that evening. We were a little past Goring then, and we decided to go on to Pangbourne and spend the night there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="下午四点左右，我们开始讨论晚上的安排。我们刚过戈灵，决定再划一会儿到潘本过夜。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">However, we all agreed that we should continue our trip. We had come to enjoy ourselves for a fortnight on the river, and we were going to finish the trip. If it killed us -- well, that would be a sad thing for our friends and families, but we would not give in to the weather.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，有一点我们一致同意——那就是一定要把旅行进行到底。我们来就是为了要在河上痛痛快快地玩两个星期，我们一定要善始善终，即使因此送了命！——当然，这对亲朋好友来说是件惨痛的事，但我们也绝不愿向天气屈服。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We sat and thought about it. We would be in Pangbourne by five o'clock. We would finish our dinner by half past six. After that we could walk about the village in the rain, or we could sit in a dark little pub.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们坐在那儿，想着晚上的安排：大概五点钟到潘本，六点半吃完晚饭，然后我们可以顶着雨在村子里转一转，或者在一家灯光幽暗的小酒馆里坐坐。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'It would be more interesting to go to the Alhambra Theatre in London,'Harris said, and he looked out at the sky.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="二十分钟后，三条人影和一只蔫了脑袋的狗离开了最近的一家船坞，奔向火车站。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Nobody said a word. We looked at each other, and we all felt badly about it. We did not speak, but we got out the bag. We looked up the river, and down the river. There was nobody there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没人答话，大家面面相觑，对这个想法都感到汗颜。虽然没人说什么，可我们把包拿了出去。我们看看上游，看看下游，一个人都没有。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“然后再在那家法国小餐厅吃顿晚餐，”我又加了一句。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We reached Paddington station at seven o'clock, and we drove straight to the restaurant. We had a light meal and left Montmorency there. Then we went to the theatre. For some reason everybody stared at us, and this made us very happy. Perhaps it was because of our interesting clothes, or because we looked so healthy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="七点钟，我们赶到了帕丁顿车站，坐车径直去了餐厅。我们略微吃了点东西，把“元帅”留在那里。接着又去了戏院。可那儿的人不知为什么都盯着我们看，这让我们十分自豪。可能是因为我们有趣的着装，或是因为我们看上去十分健康。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'I know we've decided to stay and die on this boat,'George said,'but there is a train which leaves Pangbourne soon after five o'clock. We could be in London in time to get something to eat, and afterwards we could go on to the theatre. '</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我明白咱们已经下决心呆在船上，死在这里，”乔治说，“不过五点钟马上有一趟火车离开潘本，我们也许能及时赶回伦敦，好好吃上一顿；然后还可以去戏院看戏。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'Yes, I'm almost sorry we've decided to stay on the boat,'Harris said. Then we were silent for a time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊，我真后悔我们决定还要呆在这条船上，”哈里斯说。一度，大家都沉默不语。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We had told the boatman a lie. We had asked him to take care of the boat for us until nine o'clock the next morning. We said we would come back for it then. However, if ( only' if') something happened to stop us from coming back, then we would write to him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们向管船人撒了个谎。我们请他照看我们的船，明天早上九点我们会回来取的。要是（我们说“万一”），我们被意外绊住了脚，赶不回来，我们会写信告诉他的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We really did enjoy that supper. For ten days we had lived on cold meat and bread, and not much else. We ate and drank without speaking, and then we sat back and rested. We felt good, and thoughtful, and kind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那顿饭我们吃得痛快极了。十天来，我们一直只靠冷肉、面包和其它一些不多的东西过活。我们边吃边喝，谁也顾不上说话。吃完饭，我们靠在椅子上，惬意地休息着，觉得一切都那么美好，仁慈，意味深长。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then Harris, who was sitting next to the window, pulled back the curtain and looked out into the street. It was still raining, and it was dark and very wet. One or two people hurried past. The rain was running from their umbrellas, and the women were holding up their long skirts.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，坐在窗口的哈里斯拉开窗帘，向街上望去。天还下着雨，阴沉沉，湿漉漉的。一两个行人匆匆走过，雨水顺着他们的雨伞滴下来，女士们都拎起她们长长的裙子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And Montmorency stood on his back legs in front of the window, looked out into the night, and gave a short bark to show that he agreed.</div>
