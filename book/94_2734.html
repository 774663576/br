<div class="line_en">And the lonelier Elsa gets in the real world, the larger her army in the Land-of-Almost-Awake. The harder the lashes of rolled-up towels in the day, the more astounding the adventures she gets to ride into in the night. In Miamas, no one says she has to learn to fit in. That's why Elsa wasn't especially impressed when Dad took her to that hotel in Spain and explained that it was "all-inclusive" there. Because if you have a granny, your whole life is all-inclusive.</div>

<div class="line_en">A grandmother is both a sword and a shield. When they say at school that Elsa is "different," as if this is something bad; or when she comes home with bruises and the headmaster says she "has to learn to fit in," this is when Granny backs her up. Won't let her apologize. Refuses to let her take the blame. Granny never says to Elsa that she shouldn't let it get to her because "then they won't enjoy teasing you as much." Or that she should "just walk away." Granny knows better than that.</div>

<div class="line_en">Her teachers at school say that Elsa is having "concentration issues." But it isn't true. She can recite more or less all of Harry Potter by memory. She can outline the exact superpowers of all the X-Men and knows exactly which of them Spider-Man could and could not take out in a fight. And she can draw a fairly okay version of the map at the start of The Lord of the Rings with her eyes closed. Unless Granny is standing next to her, tugging at the paper and moaning about how this is insanely boring and how she'd rather take Renault out and "do something." She's a bit restless, Granny. But she has shown Elsa every corner of Miamas and all the corners of the other five kingdoms in the Land-of-Almost-Awake. Even the ruins of Mibatalos, which was sacked by the shadows at the end of the War-Without-End. Elsa has stood with Granny on the rocks by the coast, where the ninety-nine snow-angels sacrificed themselves; she has looked out over the sea, where one day the shadows will come back. And she knows all about the shadows, because Granny always says one should know one's enemies better than oneself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="学校的老师说爱莎有“注意力问题”，但这不是真的。她能凭借记忆，复述出差不多所有“哈利·波特”的故事；她能概括出每个X战警确切的超能力，知道他们中哪个能被蜘蛛侠打败，哪个不能；她能闭着眼睛，大致画出《魔戒》正文前的地图，只要外婆不站在她身边，扯她的纸，唠叨着这太无聊了，不如开着雷诺出去兜兜风。外婆这个人挺容易不耐烦的，但她向爱莎展示了密阿玛斯的每个角落，以及不眠大陆其他五个王国的所有地方，甚至是密巴塔洛斯的废墟，在无尽战争的尾声，那里被暗影摧毁了。爱莎曾与外婆并肩站在海边的石头上——九十九位雪天使牺牲的地方；她也曾望着大海的远方——暗影有朝一日卷土重来的地方。她知道所有关于暗影的事情，因为外婆总说，要比了解自己更了解你的敌人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The shadows were dragons in the beginning, but they had an evil and a darkness of such strength within themselves that it made them into something else. Something much more dangerous. They hate people and their stories; they have hated for so long and with such intensity that in the end the darkness enveloped their whole bodies until their shapes were no longer discernible. That is also why they are so difficult to defeat, because they can disappear into walls or into the ground or float up. They're ferocious and bloodthirsty, and if you're bitten by one you don't just die; a far more serious and terrible fate lies in store: you lose your imagination. It just runs out of your wound and leaves you gray and empty. You wither away year by year until your body is just a shell. Until no one remembers any fairy tales anymore.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="暗影最开始是龙，但它们内心的邪恶和黑暗力量使它们变成了另一种更危险的东西。它们痛恨人类以及人类的故事，长久的深仇重怨最终使它们的整个身体被黑暗所笼罩，直到身形轮廓都无法辨识，这也是它们很难被击败的原因。它们能穿墙、入地、飘浮空中，而且残忍嗜杀，如果你被暗影咬了，你不会马上死，更严重更可怕的命运会降临到你的身上：失去想象力。想象力会从你的伤口消散，留下阴郁和空虚。年复一年，你日渐衰惫，直到身躯只剩下外壳，再也不能记起任何一个童话故事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Granny says people who think slowly always accuse quick thinkers of concentration problems. "Idiots can't understand that non-idiots are done with a thought and already moving on to the next before they themselves have. That's why idiots are always so scared and aggressive. Because nothing scares idiots more than a smart girl."</div>

Elsa doesn't know who they are, Granny just calls them her "stars," because when the streetlight comes through the blinds they glitter like the sky at night. Men in uniforms stand there and other men in doctors' coats and a few men with hardly any clothes on at all. Tall men and smiling men and men with moustaches and heavyset men wearing hats, and they all stand next to Granny and they look as if she just told them a cheeky joke. None of them are looking into the camera, because none of them can tear their eyes away from her.</div>

<div class="line_en">Granny is young. She is beautiful. And immortal. She stands by road signs whose letters Elsa can't read; she stands outside tents in deserts between men with rifles in their hands. And everywhere in the photos are children. Some of them have bandages around their heads and some lie in hospital beds with tubes inserted into their bodies, and one of them only has one arm and a stump where the other arm should have been. But one of the boys hardly looks hurt at all. He looks like he could run fifty miles in his bare feet. He's about the same age as Elsa, and his hair is so thick and tangled that you could lose your keys in it, and there's something in his eyes as if he'd just found a secret stash of fireworks and ice cream. His eyes are big and perfectly round and so black that the surrounding white is like chalk on a blackboard. Elsa doesn't know who he is, but she calls him the Werewolf Boy, because that is what he looks like to her.</div>

<div class="line_en">Elsa is sitting on the bench outside the big window. She's so cold that her teeth are chattering. Her mum is inside talking to the woman who sounds like a whale, or, at least, the way Elsa imagines a whale would sound. Which is difficult to know, admittedly, when you have never happened to run into a whale, but she sounds like Granny's record player after Granny tried to build a robot out of it. It was slightly unclear what sort of robot she was intending to build, but whatever the case it wasn't a very good one. And then it sounded like a whale after that whenever you tried to play a record on it. Elsa learned all about LPs and CDs that afternoon. That was when she worked out why old people seem to have so much free time, because in the olden days until Spotify came along they must have used up almost all their time just changing the track.</div>

<div class="line_en">Granny is waiting for her in the middle of the room. There's a fragrance of lilies, Mum's favorite flower. Granny doesn't have any favorite flowers because no plant lives for longer than twenty-four hours in Granny's flat, and in a fairly rare instance of compliance, possibly also because of the enthusiastic encouragement of her favorite grandchild, Granny has decided it would be bloody unfair to nature for her to have any favorite flowers.</div>

Like that time Granny dressed the snowman so he looked like a real person who'd fallen from the balcony, and Britt-Marie got so furious when she realized it was a joke that she called the police. And the next morning when Britt-Marie looked out the window, she discovered that Granny had made another identical snowman, and then Britt-Marie "went loopy," as Granny put it, and came charging out with a snow shovel. And then the snowman jumped up and roared, "WAAAAAAAAH!!!" Granny told her afterwards that she'd lain in the snow for hours waiting for Britt-Marie and at least two cats had weed on her in the meantime, "but it was well worth it!" Britt-Marie called the police again, of course, but they said it wasn't a crime to scare someone.</div>

<div class="line_en">The ink smudges over the paper when she blinks down at it. Although there are letters that Elsa doesn't know, Granny has probably misspelled things. When Granny writes, it's as if she is just scattering words over the page while she's already mentally on her way somewhere else. It's not that Granny can't spell, it's just that she thinks so fast that the letters and words can't keep up. And unlike Elsa, Granny can't see the point of spelling things correctly; anyway she was always better at science and numbers. "You bloody understand what I mean!" she hisses when she passes Elsa secret notes while they're eating with Mum and George and Elsa adds the dashes and spaces in the right places with her red felt-tip pen.</div>
