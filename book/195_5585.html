<div class="line_en">And now it happened that the fortunes of Philip Carey, of no consequence to any but himself, were affected by the events through which his country was passing. History was being made, and the process was so significant that it seemed absurd it should touch the life of an obscure medical student. Battle after battle, Magersfontein, Colenso, Spion Kop, lost on the playing fields of Eton, had humiliated the nation and dealt the death-blow to the prestige of the aristocracy and gentry who till then had found no one seriously to oppose their assertion that they possessed a natural instinct of government. The old order was being swept away: history was being made indeed. Then the colossus put forth his strength, and, blundering again, at last blundered into the semblance of victory. Cronje surrendered at Paardeberg, Ladysmith was relieved, and at the beginning of March Lord Roberts marched into Bloemfontein.</div>

<div class="line_en">It seemed a capital system to Philip. You held on till you got your profit, and you never even had to put your hand in your pocket. He began to watch the Stock Exchange columns of the paper with new interest. Next day everything was up a little, and Macalister wrote to say that he had had to pay two and a quarter for the shares. He said that the market was firm. But in a day or two there was a set-back. The news that came from South Africa was less reassuring, and Philip with anxiety saw that his shares had fallen to two; but Macalister was optimistic, the Boers couldn't hold out much longer, and he was willing to bet a top-hat that Roberts would march into Johannesburg before the middle of April. At the account Philip had to pay out nearly forty pounds. It worried him considerably, but he felt that the only course was to hold on: in his circumstances the loss was too great for him to pocket. For two or three weeks nothing happened; the Boers would not understand that they were beaten and nothing remained for them but to surrender: in fact they had one or two small successes, and Philip's shares fell half a crown more. It became evident that the war was not finished. There was a lot of selling. When Macalister saw Philip he was pessimistic.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普觉得，资本系统似乎就是这样运作。你手里握着股票，等到股价上涨就把它抛掉，好像整个过程都用不着花钱一样。他开始怀着新的兴致关注起报纸的股票交易栏。第二天早晨，所有股票都涨了一点，麦卡利斯特写信来说他只能以二又四分之一的价格买下三百股，不过市场很稳健，放心就是了。可是，一两天后，股价又下滑了，从南非传来的消息也不太乐观，菲利普看见自己的股票价格跌到两镑，心急如焚。麦卡利斯特倒还是一副胸有成竹的样子，他说布尔这仗打不了多久了，他敢打包票不到四月中旬，罗伯茨司令就会进军约翰内斯堡。可依照现在的形势，菲利普已经赔进去四十镑了。他焦灼不安，可现在唯一的出路就是继续等。就他现在的情况，这笔损失简直是无法承受的。两三个礼拜过去了，什么都没有发生。布尔人没有认识到他们必败的现实，也并不准备无条件投降。事实上，他们还打了两三场胜仗，而菲利普的股票也随之跌了半克朗还多。很明显，这场战役还没有结束。好多人都把股票抛出去了。再见麦卡利斯特的时候，他也像是泄气的皮球，再提不起精神。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip was sick with anxiety. He could not sleep at night; he bolted his breakfast, reduced now to tea and bread and butter, in order to get over to the club reading-room and see the paper; sometimes the news was bad, and sometimes there was no news at all, but when the shares moved it was to go down. He did not know what to do. If he sold now he would lose altogether hard on three hundred and fifty pounds; and that would leave him only eighty pounds to go on with. He wished with all his heart that he had never been such a fool as to dabble on the Stock Exchange, but the only thing was to hold on; something decisive might happen any day and the shares would go up; he did not hope now for a profit, but he wanted to make good his loss. It was his only chance of finishing his course at the hospital. The Summer session was beginning in May, and at the end of it he meant to take the examination in midwifery. Then he would only have a year more; he reckoned it out carefully and came to the conclusion that he could manage it, fees and all, on a hundred and fifty pounds; but that was the least it could possibly be done on.</div>

<div class="line_en">Early in April he went to the tavern in Beak Street anxious to see Macalister.

<div class="line_en">Hayward was the last person he would have expected to do anything of the kind. At the hospital men were going out now in numbers; the Government was glad to get anyone who was qualified; and others, going out as troopers, wrote home that they had been put on hospital work as soon as it was learned that they were medical students. A wave of patriotic feeling had swept over the country, and volunteers were coming from all ranks of society.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在他认识的所有人里，他唯独没想到海沃德能跑去非洲。医院里不少大夫都过去了，政府也大力欢迎有从医资格的人过去支援前线。有些人以骑兵的身份去了非洲，却写信回来说别人一发现他们是医学生，就让他们都去医院帮忙了。举国上下，每个人都为爱国主义所深深感染，社会各个阶层的人都愿为国家献上自己的一臂之力。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我是骑兵，跟着多塞特骑兵队一起去。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Philip had known Hayward for eight years. The youthful intimacy which had come from Philip's enthusiastic admiration for the man who could tell him of art and literature had long since vanished; but habit had taken its place; and when Hayward was in London they saw one another once or twice a week. He still talked about books with a delicate appreciation. Philip was not yet tolerant, and sometimes Hayward's conversation irritated him. He no longer believed implicitly that nothing in the world was of consequence but art. He resented Hayward's contempt for action and success. Philip, stirring his punch, thought of his early friendship and his ardent expectation that Hayward would do great things; it was long since he had lost all such illusions, and he knew now that Hayward would never do anything but talk. He found his three hundred a year more difficult to live on now that he was thirty-five than he had when he was a young man; and his clothes, though still made by a good tailor, were worn a good deal longer than at one time he would have thought possible. He was too stout and no artful arrangement of his fair hair could conceal the fact that he was bald. His blue eyes were dull and pale. It was not hard to guess that he drank too much.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普认识海沃德已经八年之久，曾经年少的他满心崇拜海沃德对艺术和文学的侃侃而谈，而这也是他们友情开始的原因。如今，两人已经不似当年那么亲密，但还是习惯性地经常在一起聚聚。只要海沃德在伦敦，他们就要隔三差五见上一面。海沃德的口味还是一如既往的刁钻奇特，当他说起自己对一些书的看法时，菲利普却不再像之前那样宽容，时常被他愚蠢的见解搞得火冒三丈。菲利普已经不相信这世上除了艺术之外，其他事情都没有意义。他厌恶海沃德谈到行动和成就时，那副嗤之以鼻的样子。他搅了搅面前的鸡尾酒，想起曾经和海沃德亲密无间的关系和盼着他成就一番大事业的由衷希望。其实，他的这些幻想早就破灭了，海沃德只是个一无是处却满嘴跑火车的人罢了。他发现，三十五岁的海沃德靠着一年三百镑的收入活得远不如年轻时候自在，虽然衣服还是出自上等裁缝之手，但一件总要穿上好久。这放在过去是根本不可能的事。他个头矮小，块头却挺大；金色的头发不管梳成什么发型都再也掩盖不住光秃秃的头顶，蓝色的眼珠有些呆滞无神，颜色也变浅不少。此刻，不难看出他已经喝醉了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip was silent. He felt rather silly. He understood that Hayward was being driven by an uneasiness in his soul which he could not account for. Some power within him made it seem necessary to go and fight for his country. It was strange, since he considered patriotism no more than a prejudice, and, flattering himself on his cosmopolitanism, he had looked upon England as a place of exile. His countrymen in the mass wounded his susceptibilities. Philip wondered what it was that made people do things which were so contrary to all their theories of life. It would have been reasonable for Hayward to stand aside and watch with a smile while the barbarians slaughtered one another. It looked as though men were puppets in the hands of an unknown force, which drove them to do this and that; and sometimes they used their reason to justify their actions; and when this was impossible they did the actions in despite of reason.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普缄口无言。他觉得自己就像个傻子。他能够理解，是灵魂深处的不安使海沃德做出了这个决定，尽管连他自己都不知道该如何解释这一切。他身体中的某种力量让他觉得必须要站出来为国而战。这件事来得如此诡异，因为海沃德只将爱国主义视为一种偏见。他追求的是“世界大同”，并以此自鸣得意。英格兰在他眼里不过区区一块流放地罢了，而且祖国的同胞也大多伤害过他脆弱敏感的心灵。菲利普想不透，究竟是什么会让一个人做出与其人生信条如此背道而驰的事来。按理说，在这群野蛮人大开杀戒时，海沃德应该微笑着在一旁观战才对。看来，在某种未知的力量面前，人类只能甘拜下风，沦为软弱无力的傀儡。这股力量驱使他忙东忙西、做这做那。有时能用理智为自己的行为找到原因，即使找不到，也会撇下理智，埋头行动。">查看中文翻译</div>

He kept on regretting his folly bitterly; and though he told himself that it was absurd to regret for what had happened was inevitable just because it had happened, he could not help himself.

<div class="line_en">The following evening there came by the last post the statement of his account. He examined his pass-book. He found that when he had paid everything he would have seven pounds left. Seven pounds! He was thankful he had been able to pay. It would have been horrible to be obliged to confess to Macalister that he had not the money. He was dressing in the eye-department during the summer session, and he had bought an ophthalmoscope off a student who had one to sell. He had not paid for this, but he lacked the courage to tell the student that he wanted to go back on his bargain. Also he had to buy certain books. He had about five pounds to go on with. It lasted him six weeks; then he wrote to his uncle a letter which he thought very business-like; he said that owing to the war he had had grave losses and could not go on with his studies unless his uncle came to his help. He suggested that the Vicar should lend him a hundred and fifty pounds paid over the next eighteen months in monthly instalments; he would pay interest on this and promised to refund the capital by degrees when he began to earn money. He would be qualified in a year and a half at the latest, and he could be pretty sure then of getting an assistantship at three pounds a week. His uncle wrote back that he could do nothing. It was not fair to ask him to sell out when everything was at its worst, and the little he had he felt that his duty to himself made it necessary for him to keep in case of illness. He ended the letter with a little homily. He had warned Philip time after time, and Philip had never paid any attention to him; he could not honestly say he was surprised; he had long expected that this would be the end of Philip's extravagance and want of balance. Philip grew hot and cold when he read this. It had never occurred to him that his uncle would refuse, and he burst into furious anger; but this was succeeded by utter blankness: if his uncle would not help him he could not go on at the hospital. Panic seized him and, putting aside his pride, he wrote again to the Vicar of Blackstable, placing the case before him more urgently; but perhaps he did not explain himself properly and his uncle did not realise in what desperate straits he was, for he answered that he could not change his mind; Philip was twenty-five and really ought to be earning his living. When he died Philip would come into a little, but till then he refused to give him a penny. Philip felt in the letter the satisfaction of a man who for many years had disapproved of his courses and now saw himself justified.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天晚上，邮差给他送来了最新的一期账单。他核对了存折，发现付清账单后，身上就只剩七镑了。七镑呵！谢天谢地，总算能把账都付清。要是让他跟麦卡利斯特坦白自己没钱了，那该是件多么可怕的事。他要在马上到来的夏季学期里去眼科做包扎员，之前已经跟一个同学说好要买他的眼底镜，现在哪还有脸面食言反悔？他还要买书。手里只剩五镑，最多还够六个礼拜的花销。他给伯伯写了封信，自认为写得非常严肃正式。信里写到，由于战争的原因，他蒙受了巨大损失，恐怕无法继续学业，希望伯伯能慷慨相助，借他一百五十镑，分十八个月给他。等他开始挣钱，保证连本带利一并还清。最迟不过一年半他就能拿到行医资格，到时候一定能做个医师助理，每周挣三镑。没成想伯伯竟然回信说他也无能为力。现在所有东西都不值钱了，让他趁这个节骨眼典当物品很不公平。况且他手头那点钱还要留着以防自己有个头疼脑热。他在这封信的最后还训了菲利普几句，之前警告过那么多次，但他从来都不听，到了这个地步，说他很惊讶倒成撒谎了。他早就知道菲利普花钱没个节制，不知道收支平衡，早晚会落得这个下场。菲利普读着这封信，身上冷一阵，热一阵。他压根没想过会遭到伯伯的拒绝，这会儿读着信，气不打一处来。冷静下来后，头脑一片空白。如果伯伯不愿借钱，他就不能再去医院学习了。他一下子惊慌失措，不得不放下身架，又给那位牧师写了封信，把目前的情况说了个一清二楚，形容得万分紧急。可也许是因为他解释得还不够清楚，伯伯仍然没有意识到形势有多紧张，丝毫不肯松口。他回信说菲利普已经二十五岁了，本来就该自给自足。等他过世，菲利普就能继承他的遗产，不过在此之前，别想从他这讨到一个子儿。菲利普读着这封信，眼前似乎浮现出伯伯得意洋洋的样子：他从来就看不惯菲利普的所作所为，这次看他栽了跟头，心里可算满意了。">查看中文翻译</div>
