<div class="line_en">I jumped up and ran with him down to the shore. To my great surprise, I saw that it was an English ship! But why was it here? English ships never came this way. Perhaps they were pirates! "Don't let them see you, Friday!" I called. "We'll hide in the trees and watch."</div>

<div class="line_en">I was now in my twenty-seventh year on the island, and I did not want to be there for another year. We worked hard to get the corn in, and to make a lot of bread. We had dried fruit and salted meat, and big pots to keep water in. One evening Friday went out to look for a turtle for meat and eggs. But in less than an hour he was back, and he looked very afraid.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在我在这岛上已经呆了27年，我不愿再呆下去了。我们勤劳地工作，收割谷物，制成许多面包。我们准备了干果、咸肉和装水的大罐子。一天傍晚，星期五为了吃肉和海龟蛋去抓海龟。但不到一个钟头他就回来了。他看起来非常害怕。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There were eleven men in the boat, but three of them were prisoners. Their arms were tied with rope, but their legs were free and they could walk. The other sailors pushed the three prisoners up the beach, laughing and shouting and hitting them. Then some of them sat down on the sand and began to drink. Others walked away to look at the island, and two men stayed to watch the boat. The three prisoners walked slowly along the beach and sat down under a tree, not far from us. They looked very unhappy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="船上有11个人，但其中3个是俘虏。他们的手臂用绳子捆着，但他们的脚是自由的，可以走路。其他水手把这3个俘虏押到海滩上，笑着，叫着并踢他们。一些人坐在沙滩上开始喝酒。其他人走开去观察小岛，留下两个人看守小船。3个俘虏沿着海滩走得很慢，在离我们不远的树下坐了下来。他们显得非常沮丧。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I am the captain of that ship," he said, "and these two men are my first and second officers. Last night there was a mutiny, and the seamen took the ship from me. Now they're going to leave the three of us here, to die on this island."</div>

<div class="line_en">Very quietly, I came up behind them through the trees, and called out to them in English.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我悄悄地穿过树丛走到他们后面，用英语招呼他们。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Do these mutineers have guns?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这些反叛者有枪么？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Only two," he answered, "and they've left those on the boat."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“只有两支枪，”他回答，“他们把枪留在小船上了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The three men turned and looked at me. They did not answer at once; they were too surprised. Perhaps they thought I was a wild man myself, in my strange home-made clothes of animals skins, and with my long hair and beard. Then the oldest man spoke.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这3个人转过身来看着我。他们没有马上回答；他们很惊讶。可能会认为我这个穿着用动物皮毛自制的古怪衣服，长长的头发和胡须的人是个野人。稍后，最年长的人说话了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The first part was easy because the seamen were not ready for a fight. We shot the two men at the boat, and the captain shot another man. This man, Tom Smith, was the worst of them all and he began the mutiny on the ship. Then the captain talked to the other five men, and they agreed to help him. They did not really want to be mutineers, but they were afraid of Tom Smith.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第一步还是容易的，因为水手没有作战的准备。我们开枪打死了船上的两人，船长击毙了另一个。这个叫汤姆·史密斯的，是其中最坏的一个。他发动了这个船上的叛乱。然后船长和其他5个人谈话，他们答应帮助船长。他们并非真的想成为反叛者，只是他们畏惧汤姆·史密斯。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"All right," I said. "We'll fight them, but if we get your ship back for you, you must take me back to England."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好的，”我说。“我们来打他们，但是如果我们为你夺回了船，你们必须带我回英国去。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Twenty-six," the captain replied, "and they will fight hard because they won't want to go home. It is death for all mutineers in England. But not all the men are bad. I'm sure that some of them will help me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“26个，”船长回答，“他们会顽强抵抗，因为他们不想回家。在英国所有的反叛者都会处以死刑。但并非所有的人都坏。我相信有一些人会帮助我的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was a long hard fight, but by now it was dark and this helped us very much. We ran here and there in the trees, calling and shouting. The seamen could not see us and did not know how many men they were fighting. In the end the first officer shouted to them:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是一场艰苦的持久战，但此刻天已黑了，这对我们很有利。我们在树丛里到处跑，叫喊着。水手们看不见我们也不知道和他们打仗的有多少人。最后，大副朝他们喊：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Just then we saw another boat, which was coming from the ship to the shore. There were ten men in it, and they all had guns. We ran into the trees and waited.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时我们看见另一只小船，正离开大船向岸边驶来。船上有10个人，他们都带了枪。我们跑进树丛等着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So the seamen stopped fighting and we took their guns. Three of the men agreed to come back to the captain, and we put the others in my cave. Friday and I stayed to watch the prisoners, while the captain and his men went back to fight for the ship.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因此水手们停止了作战，我们缴了他们的枪。其中3人同意回到船长这边，我们把其余的人送进我的山洞里。我和星期五留下看守俘虏，而船长和他的手下回去为夺船而战斗。">查看中文翻译</div>

I showed them my three houses, my cornfields and my goats, and all my tools. Their life would he easy because of all my hard work for so many years.</div>
