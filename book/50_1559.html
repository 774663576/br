<div class="line_en">The man Jack paused on the landing. With his left hand he pulled a large white handkerchief from the pocket of his black coat, and with it he wiped off the knife and his gloved right hand which had been holding it; then he put the handkerchief away. The hunt was almost over. He had left the woman in her bed, the man on the bedroom floor, the older child in her brightly colored bedroom, surrounded by toys and half-finished models. That only left the little one, a baby barely a toddler, to take care of. One more and his task would be done.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="小孩的房间在顶楼。杰克之一走上楼梯，落在地毯上的脚步无声无息。他推开阁楼的门，走了进去。他的黑色皮鞋擦得锃亮，闪耀得如同黑色的镜子，映照出小小的弦月。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The man Jack's eyes were accustomed to the dim moonlight, so he had no desire to turn on an electric light. And light was not that important, after all. He had other skills.</div>

<div class="line_en">The man Jack sniffed the air. He ignored the scents that had come into the room with him, dismissed the scents that he could safely ignore, honed in on the smell of the thing he had come to find. He could smell the child: a milky smell, like chocolate chip cookies, and the sour tang of a wet, disposable, nighttime diaper. He could smell the baby shampoo in its hair, and something small and rubbery -- a toy, he thought, and then, no, something to suck -- that the child had been carrying.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰克之一嗅了嗅空气，忽略那些由自己带进房间的气味，不理会那些可以放心不管的气味，而是聚精会神地寻找猎物的气息。他闻到了那个孩子的味道：巧克力饼干似的奶味、潮湿的一次性夜用尿布的酸臭味、孩子头发上散发出的儿童洗发水的气味。他还闻到了一个橡胶做的小东西——一个玩具，他心想，不，是个用来吮吸的东西——那个小孩一直含着它。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The child had been here. It was here no longer. The man Jack followed his nose down the stairs through the middle of the tall, thin house. He inspected the bathroom, the kitchen, the airing cupboard, and, finally, the downstairs hall, in which there was nothing to be seen but the family's bicycles, a pile of empty shopping bags, a fallen diaper, and the stray tendrils of fog that had insinuated themselves into the hall from the open door to the street.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="孩子曾在这儿，可现在不在了。杰克之一循着气味走下楼梯，在这栋高而窄的房屋里穿行。他一一查看浴室、厨房、通风橱柜，最后来到楼下的走廊。走廊里看不见别的，只有这家人的几辆自行车、一堆空的购物袋、一块掉在地上的尿布，还有透过紧邻马路的前门缓缓飘入走廊的袅袅雾气。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="杰克之一嗅了嗅空气，不紧不慢地朝山上走去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The man Jack made a small noise then, a grunt that contained in it both frustration and also satisfaction. He slipped the knife into its sheath in the inside pocket of his long coat, and he stepped out into the street. There was moonlight, and there were streetlights, but the fog stifled everything, muted light and muffled sound and made the night shadowy and treacherous. He looked down the hill towards the light of the closed shops, then up the street, where the last high houses wound up the hill on their way to the darkness of the old graveyard.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰克之一轻哼一声，哼声中既有沮丧，又有满足。他把刀插回长外套内袋里的刀鞘，走到路上。路上有月光，也有路灯，可雾气扼住了一切，削弱了光线，压抑了声音，让夜色变得阴森幽暗，暗藏杀机。他看向山下几家打烊的店铺透出的灯光，又抬头看了看马路，几栋高楼依山而建，盘山而上，通往黑暗中的那片老坟场。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That night, he had been woken by the sound of something on the floor beneath him falling with a crash. Awake, he soon became bored, and had begun looking for a way out of his crib. It had high sides, like the walls of his playpen downstairs, but he was convinced that he could scale it. All he needed was a step…</div>

<div class="line_en">Ever since the child had learned to walk he had been his mother's and father's despair and delight, for there never was such a boy for wandering, for climbing up things, for getting into and out of things.</div>

<div class="line_en">He pulled his large, golden teddy bear into the corner of the crib, then, holding the railing in his tiny hands, he put his foot onto the bear's lap, the other foot up on the bear's head, and he pulled himself up into a standing position, and then he half-climbed, half-toppled over the railing and out of the crib.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他把大大的金色泰迪熊拖到婴儿床的角落，小手抓住床的围挡，一只脚踩在熊的大腿上，另一只脚踩在熊的脑袋上，用力支起身子，半爬半滚地翻过了婴儿床的围挡。">查看中文翻译</div>

He was surprised when he hit the floor, but he did not cry out: if you cried they came and put you back in your crib.</div>

<div class="line_en">His diaper had worked itself loose on his journey on his bottom down the stairs, and when he reached the last step, when he reached the little hall and stood up, the diaper fell off.

<div class="line_en">She crouched down and peered at something on the ground, as a patch of shadow moved into the moonlight, revealing itself to be a grizzled man in his mid-forties. He looked down at his wife, and then looked at what she was looking at, and he scratched his head.</div>

<div class="line_en">You might think -- and if you did, you would be right -- that Mr. Owens should not have taken on so at seeing a ghost, given that Mr. and Mrs. Owens were themselves dead and had been for a few hundred years now, and given that the entirety of their social life, or very nearly, was spent with those who were also dead. But there was a difference between the folk of the graveyard and this: a raw, flickering, startling shape the grey color of television static, all panic and naked emotion which flooded the Owenses as if it was their own. Three figures, two large, one smaller, but only one of them was in focus, was more than an outline or a shimmer. And the figure said, My baby! He is trying to harm my baby!</div>

<div class="line_en">"What did he do to you?" asked Mrs. Owens, but she was not certain that the ghost could hear her. Recently dead, poor love, she thought. It's always easier to die gently, to wake in due time in the place you were buried, to come to terms with your death and to get acquainted with the other inhabitants. This creature was nothing but alarm and fear for her child, and her panic, which felt to the Owenses like a low-pitched screaming, was now attracting attention, for other pale figures were coming from all over the graveyard.</div>

He had reserved for himself the best location on the hill -- a natural amphitheater, with a view of the whole city and beyond -- and had insured that the graveyard endured as a graveyard, for which the inhabitants of the graveyard were grateful, although never quite as grateful as Josiah Worthington, Bart., felt they should have been.</div>

He couldn't push the minds of the dead as he could the living, but he could use all the tools of flattery and persuasion he possessed, for the dead are not immune to either.

The size of a Shire horse it was, a full nineteen hands or more.

It took several huge, clattering steps, then it was off the side of the hill and cantering across the sky. Its thunderous hooves became an early rumble of distant thunder, and in moments it was lost to sight.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the little town at the bottom of the hill the man Jack was getting increasingly angry. The night had been one that he had been looking forward to for so long, the culmination of months -- of years -- of work.

He found the tall house on the side of the hill, and he examined the three bodies he found there, and he studied the pattern of the knife-wounds. When he was satisfied he stepped out into the morning's dark, his head churning with unpleasant possibilities, and he returned to the graveyard, to the chapel spire where he slept and waited out the days.</div>
