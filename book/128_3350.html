<div class="line_en">If you really want to hear about it, the first thing you'll probably want to know is where I was born, and what my lousy childhood was like, and how my parents were occupied and all before they had me, and all that David Copperfield kind of crap, but I don't feel like going into it, if you want to know the truth. In the first place, that stuff bores me, and in the second place, my parents would have about two hemorrhages apiece if I told anything pretty personal about them. They're quite touchy about anything like that, especially my father. They're nice and all -- I'm not saying that -- but they're also touchy as hell. Besides, I'm not going to tell you my whole goddam autobiography or anything. I'll just tell you about this madman stuff that happened to me around last Christmas just before I got pretty run-down and had to come out here and take it easy. I mean that's all I told D. B. about, and he's my brother and all. He's in Hollywood. That isn't too far from this crumby place, and he comes over and visits me practically every week end. He's going to drive me home when I go home next month maybe. He just got a Jaguar. One of those little English jobs that can do around two hundred miles an hour. It cost him damn near four thousand bucks. He's got a lot of dough, now. He didn't use to. He used to be just a regular writer, when he was home. He wrote this terrific book of short stories, The Secret Goldfish, in case you never heard of him. The best one in it was "The Secret Goldfish." It was about this little kid that wouldn't let anybody look at his goldfish because he'd bought it with his own money. It killed me. Now he's out in Hollywood, D. B., being a prostitute. If there's one thing I hate, it's the movies. Don't even mention them to me.</div>

<div class="line_en">Where I want to start telling is the day I left Pencey Prep. Pencey Prep is this school that's in Agerstown, Pennsylvania. You probably heard of it. You've probably seen the ads, anyway. They advertise in about a thousand magazines, always showing some hot-shot guy on a horse jumping over a fence. Like as if all you ever did at Pencey was play polo all the time. I never even once saw a horse anywhere near the place. And underneath the guy on the horse's picture, it always says: "Since 1888 we have been molding boys into splendid, clear-thinking young men." Strictly for the birds. They don't do any damn more molding at Pencey than they do at any other school. And I didn't know anybody there that was splendid and clear-thinking and all. Maybe two guys. If that many. And they probably came to Pencey that way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我打算从我离开潘西中学那天讲起。潘西这学校在宾夕法尼亚州埃杰斯镇。你也许听说过。也许你至少看见过广告。他们差不多在一千份杂志上登了广告，总是一个了不起的小伙子骑着马在跳篱笆。好象在潘西除了比赛马球就没有事可做似的。其实我在学校附近连一匹马的影儿也没见过。在这幅跑马图底下，总是这样写着：“自从一八八八年起，我们就把孩子栽培成优秀的、有脑子的年轻人。”完全是骗人的鬼话。在潘西也象在别的学校一样，根本没栽培什么人材。而且在那里我也没见到任何优秀的、有脑子的人。也许有那么一两个。可他们很可能在进学校时候就是那样的人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Anyway, it was the Saturday of the football game with Saxon Hall. The game with Saxon Hall was supposed to be a very big deal around Pencey. It was the last game of the year, and you were supposed to commit suicide or something if old Pencey didn't win. I remember around three o'clock that afternoon I was standing way the hell up on top of Thomsen Hill, right next to this crazy cannon that was in the Revolutionary War and all. You could see the whole field from there, and you could see the two teams bashing each other all over the place. You couldn't see the grandstand too hot, but you could hear them all yelling, deep and terrific on the Pencey side, because practically the whole school except me was there, and scrawny and faggy on the Saxon Hall side, because the visiting team hardly ever brought many people with them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="嗯，那天正好是星期六，要跟萨克逊。霍尔中学赛橄榄球。跟萨克逊。霍尔的这场比赛被看作是潘西附近的一件大事。这是年内最后一场球赛，要是潘西输了，看样子大家非自杀不可。我记得那天下午三点左右，我爬到高高的汤姆孙山顶上看赛球，就站在那尊曾在独立战争中使用过的混帐大炮旁边。从这里可以望见整个球场，看得见两队人马到处冲杀。看台里的情况虽然看不很清楚，可你听得见他们的呦喝声，一片震天价喊声为潘西叫好，因为除了我，差不多全校的人都在球场上，不过给萨克逊。霍尔那边叫好的声音却是稀稀拉拉的，因为到客地来比赛的球队，带来的人总是不多的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There were never many girls at all at the football games. Only seniors were allowed to bring girls with them. It was a terrible school, no matter how you looked at it. I like to be somewhere at least where you can see a few girls around once in a while, even if they're only scratching their arms or blowing their noses or even just giggling or something.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在每次橄榄球比赛中总很少见到女孩子。只有高班的学生才可以带女孩子来看球。这确实是个阴森可怕的学校，不管你从哪个角度看它。我总希望自己所在的地方至少偶尔可以看见几个姑娘，哪怕只看见她们在搔胳膊、擤鼻子，甚至在吃吃地傻笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Old Selma Thurmer -- she was the headmaster's daughter -- showed up at the games quite often, but she wasn't exactly the type that drove you mad with desire. She was a pretty nice girl, though. I sat next to her once in the bus from Agerstown and we sort of struck up a conversation. I liked her. She had a big nose and her nails were all bitten down and bleedy-looking and she had on those damn falsies that point all over the place, but you felt sort of sorry for her. What I liked about her, she didn't give you a lot of horse manure about what a great guy her father was. She probably knew what a phony slob he was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="赛尔玛。绥摩――她是校长的女儿――倒是常常出来看球，可象她这样的女人，实在引不起你多大兴趣。其实她为人倒挺不错。有一次我跟她一起从埃杰斯镇坐公共汽车出去，她就坐在我旁边，我们俩随便聊起天来。我挺喜欢她。她的鼻子很大，指甲都已剥落，象在流血似的，胸前还装着两只假奶，往四面八方直挺，可你见了，只觉得她可怜。我喜欢她的地方，是她从来不瞎吹她父亲有多伟大。也许她知道他是个假模假式的饭桶。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The reason I was standing way up on Thomsen Hill, instead of down at the game, was because I'd just got back from New York with the fencing team. I was the goddam manager of the fencing team. Very big deal. We'd gone in to New York that morning for this fencing meet with McBurney School. Only, we didn't have the meet. I left all the foils and equipment and stuff on the goddam subway. It wasn't all my fault. I had to keep getting up to look at this map, so we'd know where to get off. So we got back to Pencey around two-thirty instead of around dinnertime. The whole team ostracized me the whole way back on the train. It was pretty funny, in a way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我之所以站在汤姆孙山顶，没下去看球，是因为我刚跟击剑队一道从纽约回来。我还是这个击剑队的倒楣领队。真了不起。我们一早出发到纽约去跟麦克彭尼中学比赛击剑。只是这次比赛没有比成。我们把比赛用的剑、装备和一些别的东西一古脑儿落在他妈的地铁上了。这事也不能完全怪我。我得不住地站起来看地图，好知道在哪儿下车。结果，我们没到吃晚饭时间，在下午两点三十分就已回到了潘西。乘火车回来的时候全队的人一路上谁也不理我。说起来，倒也挺好玩哩。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The other reason I wasn't down at the game was because I was on my way to say good-by to old Spencer, my history teacher. He had the grippe, and I figured I probably wouldn't see him again till Christmas vacation started. He wrote me this note saying he wanted to see me before I went home. He knew I wasn't coming back to Pencey.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我没下去看球的另一原因，是我要去向我的历史老师老斯宾塞告别。他患着流行性感冒，我揣摩在圣诞假期开始之前再也见不到他了。他写了张条子给我，说是希望在我回家之前见我一次。他知道我这次离开潘西后再也不回来了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I forgot to tell you about that. They kicked me out. I wasn't supposed to come back after Christmas vacation, on account of I was flunking four subjects and not applying myself and all. They gave me frequent warning to start applying myself -- especially around midterms, when my parents came up for a conference with old Thurmer -- but I didn't do it. So I got the ax. They give guys the ax quite frequently at Pencey. It has a very good academic rating, Pencey. It really does.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我忘了告诉你这件事。他们把我踢出了学校，过了圣诞假后不再要我回来，原因是我有四门功课不及格，又不肯好好用功。他们常常警告我，要我好好用功――特别是学期过了一半，我父母来校跟老绥摩谈过话以后――可我总是当耳边风。于是我就给开除了。他们在潘西常常开除学生。潘西在教育界声誉挺高。这倒是事实。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Anyway, it was December and all, and it was cold as a witch's teat, especially on top of that stupid hill. I only had on my reversible and no gloves or anything. The week before that, somebody'd stolen my camel's-hair coat right out of my room, with my fur-lined gloves right in the pocket and all. Pencey was full of crooks. Quite a few guys came from these very wealthy families, but it was full of crooks anyway. The more expensive a school is, the more crooks it has -- I'm not kidding. Anyway, I kept standing next to that crazy cannon, looking down at the game and freezing my ass off. Only, I wasn't watching the game too much. What I was really hanging around for, I was trying to feel some kind of a good-by. I mean I've left schools and places I didn't even know I was leaving them. I hate that. I don't care if it's a sad good-by or a bad good-by, but when I leave a place I like to know I'm leaving it. If you don't, you feel even worse.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="嗯，那是十二月，天气冷得象巫婆的奶头，尤其是在这混帐的小山顶上。我只穿了件晴雨两用的风衣，没戴手套什么的。上个星期，有人从我的房间里偷走了我的骆驼毛大衣，大衣袋里还放着我那副毛皮里子的手套。潘西有的是贼。不少学生都是家里极有钱的，可学校里照样全是贼。学校越贵族化，里面的贼也越多――我不开玩笑。嗯，我当时一动不动地站在那尊混帐大炮旁边，看着下面的球赛，冻得我屁股都快掉了。只是我并不在专心看球。我流连不去的真正目的，是想跟学校悄悄告别。我是说过去我也离开过一些学校，一些地方，可我在离开的时候自己竞不知道。我痛恨这类事情。我不在乎是悲伤的离别还是不痛快的离别，只要是离开一个地方，我总希望离开的时候自己心中有数。要不然，我心里就会更加难受。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I was lucky. All of a sudden I thought of something that helped make me know I was getting the hell out. I suddenly remembered this time, in around October, that I and Robert Tichener and Paul Campbell were chucking a football around, in front of the academic building. They were nice guys, especially Tichener. It was just before dinner and it was getting pretty dark out, but we kept chucking the ball around anyway. It kept getting darker and darker, and we could hardly see the ball any more, but we didn't want to stop doing what we were doing. Finally we had to. This teacher that taught biology, Mr. Zambesi, stuck his head out of this window in the academic building and told us to go back to the dorm and get ready for dinner. If I get a chance to remember that kind of stuff, I can get a good-by when I need one -- at least, most of the time I can. As soon as I got it, I turned around and started running down the other side of the hill, toward old Spencer's house. He didn't live on the campus. He lived on Anthony Wayne Avenue.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="总算我运气好。刹那间我想起了一件事，让我感觉到自己他妈的就要滚出这个地方了。我突然记起在十月间，我怎样跟罗伯特。铁奇纳和保尔。凯姆伯尔一起在办公大楼前扔橄榄球。他们都是挺不错的小伙子，尤其是铁奇纳。那时正是在吃晚饭前，外面天已经很黑了，可是我们照样扔着球。天越来越黑，黑得几乎连球都看不见了，可我们还是不肯歇手。最后我们被迫歇手了。那位教生物的老师，柴柏西先生，从教务处的窗口探出头来，叫我们回宿舍去准备吃晚饭。我要是运气好，能在紧要关头想起这一类事情，我就可以好好作一番告别了――至少绝大部分时间都可以做到。因此我一有那感触，就立刻转身奔下另一边山坡，向老斯宾塞的家奔去。他并不住在校园内。他住在安东尼。魏思路。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I ran all the way to the main gate, and then I waited a second till I got my breath. I have no wind, if you want to know the truth. I'm quite a heavy smoker, for one thing -- that is, I used to be. They made me cut it out. Another thing, I grew six and a half inches last year. That's also how I practically got t. b. and came out here for all these goddam checkups and stuff. I'm pretty healthy, though.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我一口气跑到大门边，然后稍停一下，喘一喘气。我的气很短，我老实告诉你说。我抽烟抽得凶极了，这是一个原因――那是说，我过去抽烟抽得极凶。现在他们让我戒掉了。另一个原因，我去年一年内竞长了六英寸半。正因为这个缘故，我差点儿得了肺病，现在离家来这儿作他妈的检查治疗那一套。其实，我身上什么毛病也没有。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Anyway, as soon as I got my breath back I ran across Route 204. It was icy as hell and I damn near fell down. I don't even know what I was running for -- I guess I just felt like it. After I got across the road, I felt like I was sort of disappearing.
