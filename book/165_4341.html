<div class="line_en">Ever since the Great Ravine, although history had taken multiple big turns, humanity, as a whole, had always lived in a society that was highly democratic, with ample welfare. For two centuries, the human race had held on to a subconscious consensus: No matter how bad things got, someone would step in to take care of them. This faith had almost collapsed during the disastrous Great Resettlement, but on that darkest of mornings six years ago, a miracle had nonetheless taken place.</div>

<div class="line_en">The UN and Fleet International were intensely interested in the meeting. The expectant, lost attitude prevalent in society posed a terrible danger. Human society was as fragile as a sand castle on the beach, prone to collapse with a passing gale. The leaders wanted the two former Swordholders to gather some information from Sophon that would reassure the people. In an emergency session of the PDC convened for this purpose, someone even hinted to Cheng Xin and Luo Ji that even if they couldn't get such intelligence from Sophon, perhaps it was acceptable to manufacture some.</div>

Once in a while, she might appear in public, but only to serve as an expressionless speaking tube for Trisolaris.

<div class="line_en">To Cheng Xin's eyes, Luo Ji appeared to have retained his upright, cold demeanor. Other than the fact that his hair and beard appeared even whiter in the breeze, the past seven years seemed to have left no mark on him. But then, without speaking, he smiled at her, and the gesture made her feel warm. Luo Ji reminded Cheng Xin of Fraisse. Though the two were completely different, they both brought with them some mountainlike strength from the Common Era, and gave Cheng Xin the sense that they could be relied on in this strange new time. Wade, the Common Era man who was as evil and vicious as a wolf and who had almost killed her, also had it -- so she found herself relying even on him. It was an odd feeling.</div>

She led the two through the bamboo grove in her yard, across the little wooden bridge over the trickling spring, and into the pavilionlike parlor.

<div class="line_en">Yes, she (or they?) could have succeeded in wiping them out, and had almost succeeded several times. But each time, humanity had snatched victory from the jaws of defeat through tenaciousness, cunning, and luck. After a three-century-long march, all Sophon had managed was to see her home annihilated in a sea of flames.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sophon had known of the destruction of Trisolaris four years ago. Three days earlier, after the light from the explosion had reached the Earth, she had given a brief speech to the public. She recounted the death of Trisolaris in simple words, and made no denunciation or judgment of the cause -- the gravitational wave broadcast initiated by two human ships. Many suspected that four years ago, when Trisolaris had been wiped out, those who had controlled her from four light-years away had perished in the fiery flames, but her current controllers were more likely on the spaceships of the Trisolaran Fleet. During the speech, Sophon's tone and expression had been calm. This wasn't the same as the woodenness she had shown when she had merely acted as a speaking tube, but a manifestation of her controllers' soul and spirit, a dignity and nobility in the face of annihilation that humanity could not hope to equal. People now felt an unprecedented awe toward this civilization that had lost its home world.</div>

<div class="line_en">At the time of the catastrophe, Trisolaris was in a stable era, orbiting around one of the three stars in the system at a distance of about 0.6 AU. The photoid struck the star and tore a hole through the photosphere and the convection zone. The hole was about fifty thousand kilometers in diameter, wide enough for four Earths laid side by side. Whether as a result of a deliberate choice by the attacker or coincidence, the photoid struck the star at a point along the line where the star intersected Trisolaris's ecliptic plane. Viewed from the surface of Trisolaris, an extremely bright spot appeared on the surface of the sun. Like a furnace with its door open, the powerful radiation generated by the core of the sun shot through the hole; passed through the convection zone, the photosphere, and the chromosphere; and struck the planet directly. All life outdoors on the hemisphere exposed to the radiation was burnt to a crisp within a few seconds.</div>

<div class="line_en">Next, material from the core of the sun erupted from the hole, forming a fifty-thousand-kilometer-thick fiery plume. The spewed material was tens of millions of degrees in temperature, and while some of the material fell back onto the surface of the sun under the influence of gravity, the remainder reached escape velocity and shot into space. Viewed from Trisolaris, a brilliant tree of fire grew from the surface of the sun. About four hours later, the ejected solar material reached 0.6 AU from the surface of the sun, and the tip of the flaming tree intersected the orbit of Trisolaris. After another two hours, the orbiting planet reached the tip of the fire tree and continued to pass through the ejected solar material for about thirty minutes. During this time, the planet might as well be moving through the interior of the sun -- even after the journey through space, the spewed material was still at a blazing temperature of tens of thousands of degrees. By the time Trisolaris emerged from the fire tree, it glowed with a dim red light. The entire surface had liquefied, and an ocean of lava covered the planet. Behind the planet was a long white trail through space -- steam from the boiled-off ocean. The solar wind stretched the trail out, making the planet appear as a long-tailed comet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着，恒星内部的物质从裂孔喷涌而出，形成了一股五万千米粗的烈焰喷泉。喷出的太阳物质温度高达千万度，一部分在引力的作用下落回太阳表面，一部分则达到了逃逸速度，直冲太空。从行星上看去，太阳表仿佛长出了一棵灿烂的火树。约四小时后，喷出物质穿过0.6个文单位的距离，火树的树顶与行星轨道相交。又过了两个小时，运行中的行星接触了火树的树梢，然后在喷出物质带中运行了三十分钟，这段时间，行星等于是在太阳内部运行，喷出物质经过太空的冷却后仍有几万摄氏度的高温。当行星移出喷出物质带后，它已经是一个发出暗红色光芒的天体，表面均被烧熔，岩浆的海洋覆盖了一切。行星的后面拖着一道白色的尾迹，那是被蒸发的海洋的水蒸气；而后尾迹被太阳风吹散，行星变成了一颗披散着白色长发的彗星。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The ejected solar material caused drag against the planet. After passing through the material, Trisolaris slowed down, and its orbit fell lower toward the star. The fire tree acted like a claw extended from the sun, pulling Trisolaris down with each revolution. After about ten more revolutions, Trisolaris would fall into the sun itself, and the cosmic football game played between three suns would come to its end. But this sun wouldn't survive long enough to see itself emerge as the victor.</div>

<div class="line_en">The solar eruption also lowered the pressure inside the sun, temporarily slowing down the fusion within the core. The sun dimmed rapidly until it was but a hazy outline. The giant fiery tree growing from the surface, in contrast, appeared even more striking, more brilliant, like a sharp scratch made against the inky black film of the universe. The diminished fusion meant that the core radiation no longer exerted sufficient pressure against the weight of the solar shell, and the sun began to collapse. The dim shell fell into the core, triggering a final explosion.</div>

<div class="line_en">More extreme ideas emerging from the self-mutilation camp proposed intellectual disablement. Using drugs or other neuromanipulation techniques, humans could lower their own intelligence. Moreover, such lowered intelligence could be fixed via genetic manipulation in future generations.

<div class="line_en">Most of the self-mutilation plans focused on technology and advocated humanity to retreat from the space age and the information age and found a low-technology society -- perhaps a society reliant on electricity and the internal combustion engine, such as at the end of the nineteenth century, or even an agrarian society. Considering the rapid decline in global population, these plans were feasible.

The agrarian lives of these Green Saviors were continuously broadcast to the rest of the world. In this age, it was no longer possible to find traditional farming implements, and so the tools they used had to be custom-made with funds from their sponsors.

For more than a century, churches and theologians struggled to complete a new interpretation of the Bible and of accepted doctrines -- and just when they had almost succeeded in patching up the faith, the monster that was the dark forest appeared.

<div class="line_en">But during the disastrous Great Resettlement, religions revived themselves. A new belief now became popular: In the past seventy years, humanity twice came to the brink of utter annihilation, but each time, they escaped miraculously. The two miracles, the creation of dark forest deterrence and the initiation of the universal gravitational wave broadcast, shared many characteristics: They both happened under the direction of a small number of individuals; their occurrence depended on a series of improbable coincidences (such as the fact that Gravity, Blue Space, and the droplets all entered the four-dimensional fragment simultaneously)… All these were clearly signs from some deity. At the time of both crises, the faithful had engaged in mass prayer sessions in public. It was precisely such fervent demonstrations of faith that finally led to divine salvation -- though just which god was responsible was a topic of endless debate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但在大移民灾难中，宗教开始了全面的复兴。现在，有一种思潮广为流行，认为人类在过去的七十多年中两次濒临毁灭的边缘，两次都奇迹般地脱险。这两次脱险事件——黑暗森林威慑的建立和引力波宇宙广播的启动，有许多共同的特点：它们都是在极少数人的策划下突然发生的，它们的发生依赖于许多平时看似不可能出现的机遇，比如两艘飞船和水滴同时进人四维碎块等；这都是明显的神迹。在两次危机到来时，信徒们都进行了虔诚的大规模祈祷，正是这样虔诚的祈祷最终迎来主的拯救。尽管对于究竟是来自哪个主存在着不可调和的争论。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Even Trisolaran civilization became the object of worship. Historically, Trisolaran civilization's image changed continuously in the eyes of humankind. At the beginning of the Crisis Era, they were powerful, evil alien invaders, but were also deified by the ETO. Later, Trisolaris gradually changed from devils and gods to people. With the creation of dark forest deterrence, Trisolaris's position in the eyes of humanity reached its nadir, and Trisolarans became uncivilized savages living at the pleasure of humankind. After deterrence failed, the Trisolarans revealed themselves to be genocidal conquerors. However, after the universal broadcast was initiated -- and especially after the destruction of Trisolaris -- Trisolarans turned into victims who deserved sympathy from humans, fellow refugees in the same boat.</div>

The faithful would drift below it in space suits in worship, and as many as tens of thousands sometimes participated.

<div class="line_en">After finding out about the concept of a safety notice, humans initially reacted to the news unanimously: a vociferous demand that Sophon divulge the method to broadcast a safety notice accompanied by the warning that she not commit mundicide by withholding such information. Yet soon people realized that rage and denunciations were useless against a civilization that had mastered technology far beyond humanity's knowledge and was moving farther and farther away in interstellar space. It would be far better to ask nicely, which then turned into begging. Gradually, as humans begged and begged in a cultural environment of waxing religiosity, the image of the Trisolarans transformed again. Since they possessed the secret of broadcasting the safety notice, they were angels of salvation sent by God. The only reason that humanity had not yet received such salvation was due to insufficient expression of their faith. And so the pleas directed at Sophon turned into prayers, and the Trisolarans once again became gods. Sophon's abode became a holy place, and every day, large numbers of the faithful gathered below the giant tree. At its peak, the congregation was a group several times larger than that of pilgrims in Mecca, forming an endless sea. Sophon's house hung in the air about four hundred meters above the crowd. From the surface it appeared tiny, hidden from time to time by the cloud it generated. Occasionally, Sophon would appear -- the crowd couldn't see any details, but they could see her kimono as a tiny flower in the cloud. These moments were few and far between, and they became sacred. Adherents of every faith in the crowd expressed their piety in various ways: some prayed more fervently, some cheered, some cried and poured out their hearts, some knelt, some threw themselves down and touched their foreheads to the ground. On these occasions, Sophon bowed slightly to the mass of humanity below and then quietly retreated into her house.</div>

From an angel of salvation, this ship again turned into a ship of darkness, a ship of devils. It had hijacked Gravity and cast a sinful spell of destruction on two worlds. Its crimes were unforgivable. It was Satan in the flesh.

<div class="line_en">Simultaneously, Cheng Xin's image in the public consciousness slowly changed as well. She was no longer a Swordholder unqualified for the position; she was again a great woman. People dug up an ancient story, Ivan Turgenev's "Threshold," and used it to describe her. Like the young Russian girl in that story, Cheng Xin had stepped over the threshold that no others dared to approach. Then, at the crucial moment, she had shouldered an unimaginable burden and accepted the endless humiliation that would be her lot in the days to come by refusing to send out the signal of death to the cosmos. People did not linger on the consequences of her failure to deter; instead, they focused on her love for humanity, the love that had caused so much pain that she had gone blind.</div>

<div class="line_en">At a deeper level, the public's feeling for Cheng Xin was a reaction to her subconscious maternal love. In this family-less age, mother's love was a rare thing. The welfare state that seemed like heaven satiated the children's need for the love of a mother. But now, humanity was exposed to the cruel, cold universe, where Death's scythe may fall at a moment's notice. The baby that was human civilization had been abandoned in a sinister, terrifying dark forest; it cried, hoping for a mother's touch. Cheng Xin was the perfect target for this yearning, mother's love incarnate. As the public's feelings for Cheng Xin gradually melded with the thickening atmosphere of religiosity, her image as the Saint Mary of a new era once again gained prominence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从深层分析，公众对程心的这种感情其实是对她潜意识中的母爱的回应。在这个家庭已经消失的时代，母爱也变得稀薄，天堂般的高福利社会抑制了孩子们对母爱的需求。但现在，人类世界暴露在冷酷的宇宙中。死神的镰刀随时都会落下，人类这个文明的婴儿被丢弃在阴森恐怖的黑暗森林中，他大哭起来，只想抓住妈妈的手。而程心这时正好成了寄托母爱的对象，这个来自公元世纪的年轻美丽的女性是先祖派来的爱的使者，是母爱的化身。当公众对程心的感情纳人了日益浓厚的宗教氛围中时。一个新纪元圣母的形象再次被逐渐建立起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Near the beginning of the Crisis Era, before the Great Ravine had extinguished humanity's enthusiasm, the nations of the Earth had banded together and accomplished a series of great deeds for the defense of the Solar System. These gigantic engineering projects had all reached or breached the limits of the most advanced technology of the time. Some of them, such as the space elevator, the test of the stellar-class nuclear bombs on Mercury, the breakthroughs in controlled nuclear fusion, and so on, had been recorded by history. These projects built a solid foundation for the technological leap after the Great Ravine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="危机纪元之初，人类社会的热情还没有被大低谷扑灭，为建立太阳系防御，曾经集中地球世界的资源完成了一系列的壮举。这些巨大的工程都达到或突破了当时技术的极限，像太空电梯、恒星型核弹在水星的试验、可控核聚变技术的突破等等，都已载入史册。这些工程为大低谷后的技术飞跃莫定了基拙。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But the Staircase Project wasn't one of them; it had been forgotten even before the Great Ravine. In the eyes of historians, the Staircase Project was a typical result of the ill-thought-out impulsiveness that marked the beginning of the Crisis Era, a hastily conducted, poorly planned adventure. In addition to the complete failure to accomplish its objectives, it left nothing of technological value. The space technology that eventually developed took a completely different direction.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但阶梯计划不属于此列，甚至在大低谷之前它就被遗忘了。在历史学家看来，阶梯计划是典型的危机初期激情和冲动的产物，是一次没有经过周密计划就草率进行的冒险。除了结局的完全失败，在技术上也没留下什么有价值的东西，后来的宇航技术完全是朝着另一个方向发展的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">No one could have predicted that nearly three centuries later, the Staircase Project would bring a ray of hope to an Earth mired in despair.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="谁也没有想到，在近三个世纪后，阶梯计划为绝境中的地球文明带来了一线曙先。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It would probably forever remain a mystery how the Trisolarans managed to intercept and capture the probe carrying Yun Tianming's brain.</div>

<div class="line_en">One of the cables holding the sail to the Staircase probe had broken near the orbit of Jupiter. The craft had deviated from its planned path, and the Earth, deprived of its flight parameters, lost it to the endless depths of space. If the Trisolarans had been able to intercept it later, they must have had its flight parameters after the cable broke; otherwise, even the advanced Trisolaran technology would have been incapable of locating such a small object in the vastness of space outside the Solar System. The most likely explanation was that the sophons had followed the Staircase Project probe, at least through its acceleration leg, to gather its final flight parameters. But it seemed unlikely that the sophons had followed the craft for the remainder of its long journey. The craft had passed through the Kuiper Belt and the Oort Cloud. In these regions, it could have decelerated or been pushed off course by interstellar dust. It appeared that none of these things happened, because Trisolarans wouldn't have been able to get updated parameters. Thus, the successful interception of the probe required some measure of luck.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在木星轨道附近，阶梯飞行器的一根帆索断裂，飞行器偏离了预定航线，地球方面也失去了它的轨道参数，飞行器迷失于茫茫太空中。但三体世界能够在后来截获飞行器。肯定掌握了它在帆索断裂后的轨道参教，否则，即使凭借三体技术也不可能在太阳系外的茫茫太空中搜寻到这样小的一个物体。最可能的猜侧是：阶梯飞行器起航后，至少在加速航段，智子一直跟随看它，掌握了它最后的轨道参数。但如果说智予在其后的漫长航程中一直跟随则不太可能，飞行器后来穿过了柯伊伯带，又穿过了奥尔特星云，在这些太空区域有可能因星际尘埃减速或偏航，但看来偏航并没有发生，否则三体世界不可能知道新的轨道参数。所以，阶梯飞行器被截获有一定的幸运成分。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was virtually certain that a ship from the First Trisolaran Fleet was responsible for capturing the probe -- most likely the one ship that had never decelerated. At the time, it had been sent way ahead of the rest of the fleet so that it could arrive in the Solar System a century and a half before the other ships -- but, due to its extremely high velocity, it couldn't have decelerated in time, and would have had to pass straight through the Solar System. The goal of this ship was still a mystery. After the creation of dark forest deterrence, this ship, along with the rest of the First Trisolaran Fleet, had turned away from the Solar System. The Earth had never ascertained its precise flight parameters, but if it had turned in the same general direction as the rest of the First Fleet, then it was possible that it encountered the Staircase probe. Of course, even so, the two crafts were still at great distances from each other; without precise parameters for the probe's trajectory, the Trisolaran ship couldn't have located it.</div>

<div class="line_en">A rough estimate -- the only estimate possible given the lack of more information -- would place the moment of interception between thirty and fifty years ago, but not before the Deterrence Era.</div>

<div class="line_en">Yun Tianming was now aboard the First Trisolaran Fleet. Most of the ships in the fleet were headed in the direction of Sirius. His exact condition was unknown: Perhaps his brain was kept alive by itself; or perhaps it had been implanted in a cloned body. But people were far more interested in a different question:</div>

<div class="line_en">It was understandable that the Trisolaran Fleet would attempt to capture the Staircase probe. Until the very end, direct contact between the Trisolarans and humans was limited to the droplets. They would have been interested in a live human specimen.</div>
