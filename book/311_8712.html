<div class="line_en">When she got on the bus a few minutes later, Park could tell that something was wrong. She got on like she was lost and ended up there. She was wearing the same thing she'd worn yesterday -- which wasn't that weird, she was always wearing a different version of the same thing -- but today was different. Her neck and wrists were bare, and her hair was a mess -- a pile, an all-over glob, of red curls.</div>

<div class="line_en">Eleanor had only known one Asian person in her life -- Paul, who was in her math class at her old school. Paul was Chinese. His parents had moved to Omaha to get away from the Chinese government. (Which seemed like an extreme choice. Like they'd looked at the globe and said, "Yup. That's as far away as possible.")</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃莉诺这辈子只认识一个亚洲人——保罗，是她旧学校的数学课同学。他的父母离开中国，搬到了奥马哈。（这个选择有点极端，就好像指着地球仪说：“是，就是这里，离中国最远。”）">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Paul was the one who'd taught Eleanor to say 'Asian' and not 'oriental.' "Oriental's for food," he'd said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="保罗也教埃莉诺说“亚洲”而不是“东方”。他说：“东方这个词用在食物上。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Eleanor stayed away from the n-word even in her head. It was bad enough that, thanks to Richie's influence, she went around mentally calling everyone she met a "motherfucker." (Irony.)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃莉诺远离这个词，连想都不去想。她已经够糟了，因为拜雷奇所赐，碰到任何人，她脑海里都不免浮现出“操你妈的”四个字。（真讽刺。）">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Maybe he was Filipino. Was that in Asia? Probably. Asia's out-of-control huge.</div>

<div class="line_en">Eleanor couldn't figure out what an Asian person was doing in the Flats anyway. Everybody else here was seriously white. Like, white by choice. Eleanor had never even heard the n-word said out loud until she moved here, but the kids on her bus used it like it was the only way to indicate that somebody was black. Like there was no other word or phrase that would work.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃莉诺搞不懂为什么一个亚洲人会住在佛列兹。这里每个居民都白得要命，简直像故意的一片白。直到搬来这里，埃莉诺才第一次听到人们大声说“黑鬼”两个字，跟她同校车的那些孩子都这么说，好像这才是称呼黑人的唯一方式。其他词都不管用。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That last thing, she was thinking about telling her counselor. Mrs Dunne had sat Eleanor down on her first day of school and given a little speech about how Eleanor could tell her anything. All through the speech, she kept squeezing the fattest part of Eleanor's arm.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她考虑过跟辅导老师唐恩太太说她没有牙刷。埃莉诺第一天报到，她就对埃莉诺发表了一篇小演说，说她什么都可以谈。整段演说，她都死掐着埃莉诺胳膊最胖的部分。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But if she told Mrs Dunne about the toothbrush… maybe Mrs Dunne would just get her one. And then Eleanor could stop sneaking into the bathroom after lunch to rub her teeth with salt. (She'd seen that in a Western once. It probably didn't even work.)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过如果她跟唐恩太太说牙刷的事，或许唐恩太太会帮她搞一把来。这样，埃莉诺就不必吃完午饭就溜到浴室，拿盐抹牙。（她在某部西部电影里看过用盐刷牙。可能根本没用。）">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Eleanor didn't notice at first how un-horrible everyone was being in gym. (Her head was still on the bus.) They were playing volleyball today, and once Tina said, "Your serve, bitch," but that was it, and that was practically jocular, all-things-Tina considered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一开始，埃莉诺没发现体育课的同学今天没那么恐怖。（她的心思还留在校车上。）今天是排球课，全程提娜只说了一次：“轮到你发球了，贱货。”就这样。比起提娜平日的作风，这句话根本只能算玩笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At first Eleanor thought the pads were actually bloody, but when she got closer she could see that it was just red magic marker. Somebody had written "Raghead" and "Big Red" on a few of the pads, but they were the expensive kind, so the ink was already starting to absorb.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一开始埃莉诺以为卫生巾上面是真血，走近一看才发现是红色签字笔画出来的。有的卫生巾上面写着“包巾头”或者“大号红发”。因为是高档卫生巾，签字笔墨水逐渐被吸收掉了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Eleanor got to the locker room, she realized why Tina had been so low-key; she was just waiting. Tina and her friends -- and the black girls, too, everybody wanted a piece of this -- were standing at the end of Eleanor's row, waiting for her to walk to her locker.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃莉诺回到更衣室，终于明白了提娜今天为什么如此低调：她正等着呢。提娜和她那伙人，还有黑人女孩们，全等在埃莉诺那一排储物柜的尽头，等着她走过来，不想错过好戏。">查看中文翻译</div>

She was small, and she wore her hair in two braided pigtails.</div>
