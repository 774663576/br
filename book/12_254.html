<div class="line_en">Frodo and Sam were plodding along with heavy hearts, no longer able to care greatly about their peril. Frodo's head was bowed; his burden was dragging him down again. As soon as the great Crossroads had been passed, the weight of it, almost forgotten in Ithilien, had begun to grow once more. Now, feeling the way become steep before his feet, he looked wearily up; and then he saw it, even as Gollum had said that he would: the city of the Ringwraiths. He cowered against the stony bank.</div>

<div class="line_en">Reluctantly Frodo turned his back on the West and followed as his guide led him, out into the darkness of the East. They left the ring of trees and crept along the road towards the mountains. This road, too, ran straight for a while, but soon it began to bend away southwards, until it came right under the great shoulder of rock that they had seen from the distance. Black and forbidding it loomed above them, darker than the dark sky behind. Crawling under its shadow the road went on, and rounding it sprang east again and began to climb steeply.</div>

<div class="line_en">A long-tilted valley, a deep gulf of shadow, ran back far into the mountains. Upon the further side, some way within the valley's arms, high on a rocky seat upon the black knees of the Ephel Dúath, stood the walls and tower of Minas Morgul. All was dark about it, earth and sky, but it was lit with light. Not the imprisoned moonlight welling through the marble walls of Minas Ithil long ago, Tower of the Moon, fair and radiant in the hollow of the hills. Paler indeed than the moon ailing in some slow eclipse was the light of it now, wavering and blowing like a noisome exhalation of decay, a corpse-light, a light that illuminated nothing. In the walls and tower windows showed, like countless black holes looking inward into emptiness; but the topmost course of the tower revolved slowly, first one way and then another, a huge ghostly head leering into the night. For a moment the three companions stood there, shrinking, staring up with unwilling eyes. Gollum was the first to recover. Again he pulled at their cloaks urgently, but he spoke no word. Almost he dragged them forward. Every step was reluctant, and time seemed to slow its pace, so that between the raising of a foot and the setting of it down minutes of loathing passed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个狭长的山谷，是个充满了阴影的深谷，直接切入山脉中。在另外一边，也就是山谷的另一个尽头，在伊菲尔杜斯的黑暗宝座上，矗立着米那斯魔窟的城墙和高塔。天地都笼罩在黑暗之中，但这座死城中却有着光芒，这并非是许久以前被囚禁在光鲜大理石墙壁中的月光，更不再是昔日在山谷中绽放光明的升月之塔。这里所散发出来的光芒，的确很像是月亮在蚀亏的时候所散发出来的苍白光芒，像是鬼火，如同带着腐败气息的浓雾一般，完全无法照亮四周的任何景物。在高塔和城墙上有着许多的窗户，像是无数通往虚无的黑洞，但高塔的最顶端依旧阴森地转动着，先是朝一个方向，然后再转向另一个方向，那是个观看着黑夜的巨大鬼影。三人站在那边，不由自主地被这鬼气森森所感染，无助地呆立当场。咕鲁第一个恢复镇定，他再度紧张地拉着所有人的斗篷，只是不愿发出任何声音，他几乎是硬将众人往前拉去，每一次的步伐都是极不情愿的，时光的流逝似乎也变慢了，每一次抬起脚仿佛都要经过数分钟的挣扎。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So they came slowly to the white bridge. Here the road, gleaming faintly, passed over the stream in the midst of the valley, and went on, winding deviously up towards the city's gate: a black mouth opening in the outer circle of the northward walls. Wide flats lay on either bank, shadowy meads filled with pale white flowers. Luminous these were too, beautiful and yet horrible of shape, like the demented forms in an uneasy dream; and they gave forth a faint sickening charnel-smell; an odour of rottenness filled the air. From mead to mead the bridge sprang. Figures stood there at its head, carven with cunning in forms human and bestial, but all corrupt and loathsome. The water flowing beneath was silent, and it steamed, but the vapour that rose from it, curling and twisting about the bridge, was deadly cold. Frodo felt his senses reeling and his mind darkening. Then suddenly, as if some force were at work other than his own will, he began to hurry, tottering forward, his groping hands held out, his head lolling from side to side. Both Sam and Gollum ran after him. Sam caught his master in his arms, as he stumbled and almost fell, right on the threshold of the bridge.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们就在这样万般无奈的状况下来到了那座白色的桥梁，在此，道路发着微弱的光芒，通过山谷中央的溪流继续往前，曲折地通往城门：那是个在北墙上张开的血盆大口、河两岸都有着宽广的平地，草地上点缀着白色的花朵。这些花朵也发着微光，虽然美丽，却让人不寒而栗，彷佛是某种噩梦中扭曲变形的形体。它们还发出一种类似停尸间的诡异气味，一种腐败的味道充满在空气中。那座桥梁就这样连结两岸，在桥头有着精工打造的人兽雕像，但一切都看起来丑恶、腐化。底下的水流十分寂静，它还冒着水气，只是，这些环绕着桥梁的水气却是冰寒澈骨。佛罗多觉得自己的脑中一片空白，五官六识全都天旋地转，突然间，仿佛有种超越他意志的力量接管了他，让他伸出手，盲目地跑向前，脑袋左右晃动着。山姆和咕鲁都奔上前，正当主人走到桥边，即将摔落桥下时，山姆飞快地抓住主人的手臂，扶住了他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Hold up, Mr. Frodo!" muttered Sam in Frodo's ear. "Come back! Not that way. Gollum says not, and for once I agree with him."</div>

<div class="line_en">Frodo passed his hand over his brow and wrenched his eyes away from the city on the hill. The luminous tower fascinated him, and he fought the desire that was on him to run up the gleaming road towards its gate. At last with an effort he turned back, and as he did so, he felt the Ring resisting him, dragging at the chain about his neck; and his eyes too, as he looked away, seemed for the moment to have been blinded. The darkness before him was impenetrable.</div>

<div class="line_en">Gollum, crawling on the ground like a frightened animal, was already vanishing into the gloom. Sam, supporting and guiding his stumbling master, followed after him as quickly as he could. Not far from the near bank of the stream there was a gap in the stone-wall beside the road. Through this they passed, and Sam saw that they were on a narrow path that gleamed faintly at first, as the main road did, until climbing above the meads of deadly flowers it faded and went dark, winding its crooked way up into the northern sides of the valley.</div>

<div class="line_en">Along this path the hobbits trudged, side by side, unable to see Gollum in front of them, except when he turned back to beckon them on. Then his eyes shone with a green-white light, reflecting the noisome Morgul-sheen perhaps, or kindled by some answering mood within. Of that deadly gleam and of the dark eyeholes Frodo and Sam were always conscious, ever glancing fearfully over their shoulders, and ever dragging their eyes back to find the darkening path. Slowly they laboured on. As they rose above the stench and vapours of the poisonous stream their breath became easier and their heads clearer; but now their limbs were deadly tired, as if they had walked all night under a burden, or had been swimming long against a heavy tide of water. At last they could go no further without a halt.</div>

<div class="line_en">Frodo stopped and sat down on a stone. They had now climbed up to the top of a great hump of bare rock. Ahead of them there was a bay in the valley-side, and round the head of this the path went on, no more than a wide ledge with a chasm on the right; across the sheer southward face of the mountain it crawled upwards, until it disappeared into the blackness above.</div>

<div class="line_en">And Minas Morgul answered. There was a flare of livid lightnings: forks of blue flame springing up from the tower and from the encircling hills into the sullen clouds. The earth groaned; and out of the city there came a cry. Mingled with harsh high voices as of birds of prey, and the shrill neighing of horses wild with rage and fear, there came a rending screech, shivering, rising swiftly to a piercing pitch beyond the range of hearing. The hobbits wheeled round towards it, and cast themselves down, holding their hands upon their ears.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="米那斯魔窟跟着回应了，它的回应是一道道的闪电从塔中射向空中的云朵，蓝白色的电蛇从高塔和邻近的山丘奔出，舔舐着低矮的云朵，大地发出哀鸣，从城市中发出一声刺耳的哀嚎，结合了秃鹰冷酷的嚎叫和马匹恐惧与愤怒的嘶鸣声，城中传来了撕心裂肺的刺耳之声，缓缓地升高，直到超越人类听力的极限。哈比人踉跄摔倒在地，手捂着耳朵不能动弹。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But it was too late. At that moment the rock quivered and trembled beneath them. The great rumbling noise, louder than ever before, rolled in the ground and echoed in the mountains. Then with searing suddenness there came a great red flash. Far beyond the eastern mountains it leapt into the sky and splashed the lowering clouds with crimson. In that valley of shadow and cold deathly light it seemed unbearably violent and fierce. Peaks of stone and ridges like notched knives sprang out in staring black against the uprushing flame in Gorgoroth. Then came a great crack of thunder.</div>

<div class="line_en">All that host was clad in sable, dark as the night. Against the wan walls and the luminous pavement of the road Frodo could see them, small black figures in rank upon rank, marching swiftly and silently, passing outwards in an endless stream. Before them went a great cavalry of horsemen moving like ordered shadows, and at their head was one greater than all the rest: a Rider, all black, save that on his hooded head he had a helm like a crown that flickered with a perilous light. Now he was drawing near the bridge below, and Frodo's staring eyes followed him, unable to wink or to withdraw. Surely there was the Lord of the Nine Riders returned to earth to lead his ghastly host to battle? Here, yes here indeed was the haggard king whose cold hand had smitten down the Ring-bearer with his deadly knife. The old wound throbbed with pain and a great chill spread towards Frodo's heart.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个部队全都穿着漆黑得如黑夜一般的铠甲，靠着地面微弱的反光和墙壁的形状，佛罗多勉强可以看见他们：一排一排、一行一行的小人影，寂静无声地快速前进，如同黑色的浪潮一般不停地涌出。在他们队伍之前，领军的是一群秩序井然，如同影子一般的骑兵队，领头的则是一名比所有骑士都要高大的形体，全身墨黑的骑士，只有头上有个像是头盔的皇冠，闪动着危险的光芒。他缓缓走近桥边，佛罗多的目光紧跟着他，完全无法做出别的动作，这，这莫非就是九骑士之首再度回到人世，带领他的邪恶大军前往战场？是的，眼前的就是那在幽界行走的堕落之王，他的冰刃曾经刺杀魔戒的持有者。之前的伤痕开始隐隐作痛，一股冰寒之气流向佛罗多的心脏。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As the terrible cry ended, falling back through a long sickening wail to silence, Frodo slowly raised his head. Across the narrow valley, now almost on a level with his eyes, the walls of the evil city stood, and its cavernous gate, shaped like an open mouth with gleaming teeth, was gaping wide. And out of the gate an army came.</div>

<div class="line_en">Even as these thoughts pierced him with dread and held him bound as with a spell, the Rider halted suddenly, right before the entrance of the bridge, and behind him all the host stood still. There was a pause, a dead silence. Maybe it was the Ring that called to the Wraith-lord, and for a moment he was troubled, sensing some other power within his valley. This way and that turned the dark head helmed and crowned with fear, sweeping the shadows with its unseen eyes. Frodo waited, like a bird at the approach of a snake, unable to move. And as he waited, he felt, more urgent than ever before, the command that he should put on the Ring. But great as the pressure was, he felt no inclination now to yield to it. He knew that the Ring would only betray him, and that he had not, even if he put it on, the power to face the Morgul-king -- not yet. There was no longer any answer to that command in his own will, dismayed by terror though it was, and he felt only the beating upon him of a great power from outside. It took his hand, and as Frodo watched with his mind, not willing it but in suspense (as if he looked on some old story far away), it moved the hand inch by inch towards the chain upon his neck. Then his own will stirred; slowly it forced the hand back and set it to find another thing, a thing lying hidden near his breast. Cold and hard it seemed as his grip closed on it: the phial of Galadriel, so long treasured, and almost forgotten till that hour. As he touched it, for a while all thought of the Ring was banished from his mind. He sighed and bent his head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正当这些念头如同利剑刺穿佛罗多，让他不能动弹之时，骑士突然间就在桥头停了下来，身后的所有部队也跟着静止不动，一时间天地一片静默，如同死亡般的沉重。或许是魔戒在呼唤那死灵之王，因为他似乎犹豫了片刻，感应到有其它的力量进入了他的山谷。浑身散发着恐惧之气的邪灵，用隐而不见的双眼扫视着四周。佛罗多等待着，像是毒蛇眼前的青蛙一样动弹不得；在他等待的时候，他突然确切的感觉到一股比以往都要强烈的欲望──戴上魔戒！但即使这诱惑力无比的强大，他还是不想要向它屈服。他知道魔戒只会出卖他，即使他戴上魔戒，也没有面对魔窟之王的力量，时候还没到。他自己的意志不再回应这召唤，但却恐惧地发觉到有股力量从外界袭来，操纵了他的手，佛罗多眼睁睁地看着那力量（就像是他在观看着过去的历史流逝一样）让他的手缓缓移向脖子上的项练；然后，他自己的意志开始介入，慢慢地强迫他的手退回去，命令它去寻找胸口的另一样事物。在他的手中，那东西感觉起来又冷又硬，那是凯兰崔尔女王赐给他的小玻璃管，这段时间以来一直被视若珍宝的藏在胸前，直到此刻才被想起。当他一碰到它的时候，所有魔戒的影像都被驱逐出脑海。他叹了口气，垂下头去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Soon he had passed, like a shadow into shadow, down the winding road, and behind him still the black ranks crossed the bridge. So great an army had never issued from that vale since the days of Isildur's might; no host so fell and strong in arms had yet assailed the fords of Anduin; and yet it was but one and not the greatest of the hosts that Mordor now sent forth.</div>

<div class="line_en">Frodo stirred. And suddenly his heart went out to Faramir. "The storm has burst at last," he thought. "This great array of spears and swords is going to Osgiliath. Will Faramir get across in time? He guessed it, but did he know the hour? And who can now hold the fords when the King of the Nine Riders comes? And other armies will come. I am too late.

<div class="line_en">Then at a great distance, as if it came out of memories of the Shire, some sunlit early morning, when the day called and doors were opening, he heard Sam's voice speaking. "Wake up, Mr. Frodo! Wake up!" Had the voice added: "Your breakfast is ready," he would hardly have been surprised. Certainly Sam was urgent. "Wake up, Mr. Frodo! They're gone," he said.</div>

<div class="line_en">Frodo raised his head, and then stood up. Despair had not left him, but the weakness had passed. He even smiled grimly, feeling now as clearly as a moment before he had felt the opposite, that what he had to do, he had to do, if he could, and that whether Faramir or Aragorn or Elrond or Galadriel or Gandalf or anyone else ever knew about it was beside the purpose. He took his staff in one hand and the phial in his other. When he saw that the clear light was already welling through his fingers, he thrust it into his bosom and held it against his heart. Then turning from the city of Morgul, now no more than a grey glimmer across a dark gulf, he prepared to take the upward road.</div>

<div class="line_en">They did not answer, but they followed him on to the climbing ledge. It was little to the liking of either of them, not even after facing so many other perils; but it did not last long.

They had come to the first stair that Gollum had spoken of. The darkness was almost complete, and they could see nothing much beyond their hands' stretch; but Gollum's eyes shone pale, several feet above, as he turned back towards them.</div>

<div class="line_en">Care was certainly needed. Frodo and Sam at first felt easier, having now a wall on either side, but the stairway was almost as steep as a ladder, and as they climbed up and up, they became more and more aware of the long black fall behind them. And the steps were narrow, spaced unevenly, and often treacherous: they were worn and smooth at the edges, and some were broken, and some cracked as foot was set upon them. The hobbits struggled on, until at last they were clinging with desperate fingers to the steps ahead, and forcing their aching knees to bend and straighten; and ever as the stair cut its way deeper into the sheer mountain the rocky walls rose higher and higher above their heads.</div>

They only knew that they had come to the end, when suddenly they felt no wall at their right hand. They could see very little. Great black shapeless masses and deep grey shadows loomed above them and about them, but now and again a dull red light flickered up under the lowering clouds, and for a moment they were aware of tall peaks, in front and on either side, like pillars holding up a vast sagging roof. They seemed to have climbed up many hundreds of feet, on to a wide shelf. A cliff was on their left and a chasm on their right.</div>

<div class="line_en">At length they were once more aware of a wall looming up, and once more a stairway opened before them. Again they halted, and again they began to climb. It was a long and weary ascent; but this stairway did not delve into the mountain-side. Here the huge cliff-face sloped backwards, and the path like a snake wound to and fro across it. At one point it crawled sideways right to the edge of the dark chasm, and Frodo glancing down saw below him as a vast deep pit the great ravine at the head of the Morgul Valley. Down in its depths glimmered like a glow-worm thread the wraith-road from the dead city to the Nameless Pass. He turned hastily away.</div>

<div class="line_en">Still on and up the stairway bent and crawled, until at last with a final flight, short and straight, it climbed out again on to another level. The path had veered away from the main pass in the great ravine, and it now followed its own perilous course at the bottom of a lesser cleft among the higher regions of the Ephel Dúath. Dimly the hobbits could discern tall piers and jagged pinnacles of stone on either side, between which were great crevices and fissures blacker than the night, where forgotten winters had gnawed and carved the sunless stone. And now the red light in the sky seemed stronger; though they could not tell whether a dreadful morning were indeed coming to this place of shadow, or whether they saw only the flame of some great violence of Sauron in the torment of Gorgoroth beyond. Still far ahead, and still high above, Frodo, looking up, saw, as he guessed, the very crown of this bitter road. Against the sullen redness of the eastern sky a cleft was outlined in the topmost ridge, narrow, deep-cloven between two black shoulders; and on either shoulder was a horn of stone.</div>

But that's not the way of it with the tales that really mattered, or the ones that stay in the mind. Folk seem to have been just landed in them, usually -- their paths were laid that way, as you put it. But I expect they had lots of chances, like us, of turning back, only they didn't. And if they had, we shouldn't know, because they'd have been forgotten. We hear about those as just went on -- and not all to a good end, mind you; at least not to what folk inside a story and not outside it call a good end. You know, coming home, and finding things all right, though not quite the same -- like old Mr. Bilbo.

<div class="line_en">"I wonder," said Frodo. "But I don't know. And that's the way of a real tale. Take any one that you're fond of. You may know, or guess, what kind of a tale it is, happy-ending or sad-ending, but the people in it don't know. And you don't want them to."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我也不知道，”佛罗多说：“但我也不能确定，这才是故事的真正情节。你随便找个最喜欢的故事当例子好了：你或许可以知道，或甚至是猜到这是什么样的故事，是快乐结局，还是悲剧收场，但是，故事中的主角就没有这么好运了，你也不会想要让他们先知道结局。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, sir, of course not. Beren now, he never thought he was going to get that Silmaril from the Iron Crown in Thangorodrim, and yet he did, and that was a worse place and a blacker danger than ours. But that's a long tale, of course, and goes on past the happiness and into grief and beyond it -- and the Silmaril went on and came to Eärendil. And why, sir, I never thought of that before! We've got -- you've got some of the light of it in that star-glass that the Lady gave you! Why, to think of it, we're in the same tale still! It's going on. Don't the great tales never end?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"And then we can have some rest and some sleep," said Sam. He laughed grimly. "And I mean just that, Mr. Frodo. I mean plain ordinary rest, and sleep, and waking up to a morning's work in the garden. I'm afraid that's all I'm hoping for all the time. All the big important plans are not for my sort. Still, I wonder if we shall ever be put into songs or tales. We're in one, of course; but I mean: put into words, you know, told by the fireside, or read out of a great big book with red and black letters, years and years afterwards. And people will say: 'Let's hear about Frodo and the Ring!' And they'll say: 'Yes, that's one of my favourite stories. Frodo was very brave, wasn't he, dad?' 'Yes, my boy, the famousest of the hobbits, and that's saying a lot.'"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“到那时，我们就可以好好休息一下，睡个好觉！”山姆苦笑着说：“佛罗多先生，我真的只想这样而已，我想要的只是普通的休息，睡一觉，醒来在花园里面辛苦的工作一天，我想这可能就是我辛勤工作一辈子的目标，那些重大的计划根本不符合我的性格。不过，我还是想要知道，未来到底我们会不会被放入歌曲和故事之中？当然，我们是在故事中了啦！但我的意思是说，要化成文字、在壁炉边说的故事，或是在好多好多年以后，可以从一本有着红色和黑色字的大书里面念出来。那时人们会说：‘我们来听听佛罗多和魔戒的故事！’而他们会说：‘好啊，我最喜欢这个故事了，佛罗多非常勇敢，对吧，爸爸？’‘是的，孩子，他是哈比人之中最出名的人了，这应该就可以解释一切了。’”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's saying a lot too much," said Frodo, and he laughed, a long clear laugh from his heart. Such a sound had not been heard in those places since Sauron came to Middle-earth. To Sam suddenly it seemed as if all the stones were listening and the tall rocks leaning over them. But Frodo did not heed them; he laughed again. "Why, Sam," he said, "to hear you somehow makes me as merry as if the story was already written. But you've left out one of the chief characters: Samwise the stouthearted. 'I want to hear more about Sam, dad. Why didn't they put in more of his talk, dad? That's what I like, it makes me laugh. And Frodo wouldn't have got far without Sam, would he, dad?'"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这已经解释了太多啦，”佛罗多笑着说，这是一个发自内心的清朗笑声。自从索伦来到中土世界，在这块土地上就不曾听过这样的声音了。山姆突然间感觉到，仿佛所有的岩石都在倾听着，高耸的山壁也倾压过来。但佛罗多完全不把这当一回事，他又再度笑了。“是啊，山姆，”他说：“听你这么一说，让我心情好得很，仿佛这故事已经写完了一样。但是你还漏掉一个重要的人物：坚毅的山姆魏斯。‘老爸，我想要听更多山姆的故事，老爸，他们为什么不把他的戏份加多一点呢？我最喜欢他说话了，每次都让我笑呵呵。如果没有山姆，佛罗多恐怕就走不远了，对吧，老爸？’”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was no sign of him at the mouth of their shelter nor in the shadows near. He had refused their food, though he had, as usual, accepted a mouthful of water; and then he had seemed to curl up for a sleep. They had supposed that one at any rate of his objects in his long absence the day before had been to hunt for food to his own liking; and now he had evidently slipped off again while they talked.

<div class="line_en">"All the same, I'd rather have him under my eye," said Sam. "All the more so, if he's false. Do you remember he never would say if this pass was guarded or no?

<div class="line_cn" title="“都一样，但我宁愿让他在我的监控之下，”山姆说：“而且，如果他在玩什么把戏，我更希望能够看清楚他在干什么。你还记得他从来没说清楚这里到底有没有守卫吗？现在我们在这边看到了一座塔楼，或许是空的，或许不是。你想他会不会去找里面的驻军了？可能是半兽人还是什么的？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No, I don't think so," answered Frodo. "Even if he's up to some wickedness, and I suppose that's not unlikely. I don't think it's that: not to fetch Orcs, or any servants of the Enemy. Why wait till now, and go through all the labour of the climb, and come so near the land he fears? He could probably have betrayed us to Orcs many times since we met him. No, if it's anything, it will be some little private trick of his own that he thinks is quite secret."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，我不这么认为，”佛罗多回答：“即使他有什么诡计，我想他也不会这样做。至少我认为他的计谋绝不会是去找半兽人，或是任何魔王的仆人。为什么要等到现在，为什么要花费这么大精神，这么靠近他害怕的土地之后再这样做呢？自从我们和他结伴之后，中间有不知道多少次都可以让他出卖我们。不，如果他真的有什么诡计，那一定是他自己的秘密计谋，外人完全不了解。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Very likely he can't guess himself," said Frodo. "And I don't think he's got just one plain scheme in his muddled head. I think he really is in part trying to save the Precious from the Enemy, as long as he can. For that would be the last disaster for himself too, if the Enemy got it. And in the other part, perhaps, he's just biding his time and waiting on chance."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“搞不好他自己也不知道，”佛罗多说：“我也不认为在他迷糊的脑袋里面，会有一个完整清楚的计划，我想他只是想要不让宝贝落入魔王手中，尽量拖延时间。因为，如果魔王拿到了魔戒，这会是他和全世界的最后一场灾难。就另一方面来说，他拖延时间的目的，也是为了等待适当的时机。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, I suppose you're right, Mr. Frodo," said Sam. "Not that it comforts me mightily. I don't make no mistake: I don't doubt he'd hand me over to Orcs as gladly as kiss his hand. But I was forgetting -- his Precious. No, I suppose the whole time it's been The Precious for poor Sméagol. That's the one idea in all his little schemes, if he has any. But how bringing us up here will help him in that is more than I can guess."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，佛罗多先生，我想你说的没错，”山姆说：“不过，这并不能让我放心。我不想要犯下任何错误，我并不怀疑他会兴高彩烈地把我们交给半兽人，他可能还会亲吻对方的手；但我忘记了还有他的宝贝，的确，我想这整件事情都可以归类到‘宝贝要给可怜的史麦戈’。他的阴谋中可能唯一的重点就是这个，只是，我不明白他把我们带到这里来，到底能够怎么样执行他的阴谋？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Gollum looked at them. A strange expression passed over his lean hungry face. The gleam faded from his eyes, and they went dim and grey, old and tired. A spasm of pain seemed to twist him, and he turned away, peering back up towards the pass, shaking his head, as if engaged in some interior debate. Then he came back, and slowly putting out a trembling hand, very cautiously he touched Frodo's knee -- but almost the touch was a caress. For a fleeting moment, could one of the sleepers have seen him, they would have thought that they beheld an old weary hobbit, shrunken by the years that had carried him far beyond his time, beyond friends and kin, and the fields and streams of youth, an old starved pitiable thing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="咕鲁看着他们，他瘦削、饥饿的面孔上掠过一种奇怪的表情，他眼中的光芒消失了，变得微弱、灰败，苍老而疲倦；他的脸上似乎笼罩着痛苦的阴影，摇着头，回头看着山顶，似乎陷入某种内心的挣扎中。然后他又转回头，伸出一只颤抖的手，非常小心地碰触着佛罗多的膝盖，几乎可以说是一种爱怜的动作。在那么一瞬间，如果两名睡着的哈比人看得见，他们会认为眼前站着的是一名疲倦的年老哈比人，经历了早该归于尘土的漫长岁月、所有的朋友和亲戚也全都失去，年轻的活力也早已不复记忆，只剩下又老又弱的臭皮囊。">查看中文翻译</div>
