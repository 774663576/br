<div class="line_en">We, in the meantime, had gradually been increasing Will's outings -- and the distance that he was prepared to travel. We had been to the theatre, down the road to see the morris dancers (Will kept a straight face at their bells and hankies, but he had gone slightly pink with the effort), driven one evening to an open-air concert at a nearby stately home (more his thing than mine), and once to the multiplex where, due to inadequate research on my part, we ended up watching a film about a girl with a terminal illness.</div>

<div class="line_en">May was a strange month. The newspapers and television were full of headlines about what they termed "the right to die". A woman suffering from a degenerative disease had asked that the law be clarified to protect her husband, should he accompany her to Dignitas when her suffering became too much.

<div class="line_en">The football player's parents had been savaged by the tabloid newspapers. How Could They Let Him Die? screamed the headlines. I couldn't help but feel the same way. Leo McInerney was twenty-four. He had lived with his injury for almost three years, so not much longer than Will. Surely he was too young to decide that there was nothing left to live for? And then I read what Will had read -- not an opinion piece, but a carefully researched feature about what had actually taken place in this young man's life. The writer seemed to have had access to his parents.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那个足球运动员的父母受到了小报的苛评。标题赫然几个大字：“他们怎么能让他死？”我也是这么想的。利奥•麦金纳尼二十四岁，受病痛折磨差不多三年，并不比威尔长。毫无疑问，他太年轻，他怎么知道没有活下去的价值？我读了威尔读过的那篇报道——不是一篇观点文章，而是对这个年轻人的生活中实实在在发生过的事情进行详细调查后写的专题文章。作者似乎采访过他父母。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But I knew he saw the headlines too. He had begun using the computer more since we got the new software, and he had worked out how to move a mouse by dragging his thumb across a trackpad. This laborious exercise enabled him to read the day's newspapers online. I brought him in a cup of tea one morning to find him reading about the young football player -- a detailed feature about the steps he had gone through to bring about his own death. He blanked the screen when he realized I was behind him. That small action left me with a lump somewhere high in my chest that took a full half-hour to go away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我知道他也看到了新闻。自从装上了新软件，他用电脑的次数比以前多了，他还知道如何在触摸板拖动大拇指来移动鼠标。这项辛苦的运动让他可以在网上阅读当天的新闻。有天早上，我给他端来一杯茶，发现他正在读那个年轻足球运动员的新闻——有关他是如何一步步夺取自己生命的详细报道。意识到我在身后时，他把屏幕关上了。这个小小的动作让我胸中块垒郁结，整整半小时后才消散。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Leo, they said, had played football since he was three years old. His whole life was football. He had been injured in what they termed a "million to one" accident when a tackle went wrong. They had tried everything to encourage him, to give him a sense that his life would still hold value. But he had retreated into depression. He was an athlete not just without athleticism, but without even the ability to move or, on occasion, breathe without assistance. He gleaned no pleasure from anything. His life was painful, disrupted by infection, and dependent on the constant ministrations of others. He missed his friends, but refused to see them. He told his girlfriend he wouldn't see her. He told his parents daily that he didn't want to live. He told them that watching other people live even half the life he had planned for himself was unbearable, a kind of torture.</div>

<div class="line_en">But if I had found it hard to get employment, prospects for a 55-year-old man who had only ever held one job were harder. He couldn't even get a job as a warehouseman or a security guard, he said, despairingly, as he returned home from another round of interviews. They would take some unreliable snot-nosed seventeen-year-old because the government would make up their wages, but they wouldn't take a mature man with a proven work record. After a fortnight of rejections, he and Mum admitted they would have to apply for benefits, just to tide them over, and spent their evenings poring over incomprehensible, fifty-page forms which asked how many people used their washing machine, and when was the last time they had left the country (Dad thought it might have been 1988). I put Will's birthday money into the cash tin in the kitchen cupboard. I thought it might make them feel better to know they had a little security.</div>

Thomas, she swore, clutching him to her, had grown several inches in the time they had been away. He had changed, was so grown-up, looked so much the little man.

<div class="line_en">Mum was cheerful over supper that night. She had cooked lasagne, Treena's favourite, and Thomas was allowed to stay up as a treat. We ate and talked and laughed and talked about safe things, like the football team, and my job, and what Treena's fellow students were like. Mum must have asked Treena a hundred times if she was sure she was managing okay on her own, whether there was anything she needed for Thomas -- as if they had anything spare they could have given her. I was glad I had warned Treena about how broke they were. She said no, gracefully and with conviction. It was only afterwards I thought to ask if it was the truth.</div>

I could hear Treena trying to comfort him, to reassure him, the sound of the light going on and off, a bed being rearranged. I lay in the dark, watching the sodium light filter through my blinds on to my newly painted ceiling, and waited for it to stop. But the same thin wail began again at two.

His younger brother refused to come, but issued a statement saying that no one could have been more loved, or more supported than his brother. Leo drank the milky solution of lethal barbiturate at 3.47pm and his parents said that within minutes he was in what appeared to be a deep sleep.
