<div class="line_en">He decided to spend the night there. He saw to it that all the sheep entered through the ruined gate, and then laid some planks across it to prevent the flock from wandering away during the night.

<div class="line_en">He swept the floor with his jacket and lay down, using the book he had just finished reading as a pillow. He told himself that he would have to start reading thicker books: they lasted longer, and made more comfortable pillows.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="圣地亚哥将自己的外套铺在地上，躺了下来，把刚刚读完的一本书当作枕头。睡着之前，他提醒自己，必须开始读一些更厚的书籍：读厚书能消磨更多的时间，夜间当枕头用也更舒服。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I wanted to sleep a little longer, he thought. He had had the same dream that night as a week ago, and once again he had awakened before it ended.</div>

<div class="line_en">He arose and, taking up his crook, began to awaken the sheep that still slept. He had noticed that, as soon as he awoke, most of his animals also began to stir. It was as if some mysterious energy bound his life to that of the sheep, with whom he had spent the past two years, leading them through the countryside in search of food and water. "They are so used to me that they know my schedule," he muttered. Thinking about that for a moment, he realized that it could be the other way around: that it was he who had become accustomed to their schedule.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="男孩爬起来，喝了两口酒，然后拿起牧羊棍，呼唤仍在沉睡的羊群。他早已注意到，只要他一醒，大多数的羊也都开始醒过来，仿佛有种神秘的力量把他的生命同那些羊的生命联系在一起。两年来，那些羊跟着他走遍了这片大地，四处寻找水和食物。“这些羊太熟悉我了，已经了解我的作息时间了。”他喃喃自语。略加思索，他又想，事情也可能正相反：是他已经熟悉了羊群的生活习性。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But there were certain of them who took a bit longer to awaken. The boy prodded them, one by one, with his crook, calling each by name. He had always believed that the sheep were able to understand what he said. So there were times when he read them parts of his books that had made an impression on him, or when he would tell them of the loneliness or the happiness of a shepherd in the fields. Sometimes he would comment to them on the things he had seen in the villages they passed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，总有一些羊会拖延一会儿才醒。男孩就用牧羊棍挨个捅醒它们，同时呼唤着羊的名字。他一直坚信，羊能听懂他说的话。因此，他时不时给羊群读一些给他留下深刻印象的书籍的章节，或者对羊群诉说自己在野外的孤独和快乐，或者评论一下在经常路过的城镇见到的新鲜事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But for the past few days he had spoken to them about only one thing: the girl, the daughter of a merchant who lived in the village they would reach in about four days. He had been to the village only once, the year before. The merchant was the proprietor of a dry goods shop, and he always demanded that the sheep be sheared in his presence, so that he would not be cheated. A friend had told the boy about the shop, and he had taken his sheep there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，最近两天，他的话题只有一个，就是那个女孩，一个商人的女儿，住在距离这里四天路程的一个镇上。他只到那里去过一次，是在去年。那个商人是一家纺织品店的老板。他喜欢看人当着他的面剪羊毛，以防别人弄虚作假。一个朋友指点男孩去那家店铺，于是他便赶着羊群到了那里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The girl was typical of the region of Andalusia, with flowing black hair, and eyes that vaguely recalled the Moorish conquerors.</div>

<div class="line_en">And now it was only four days before he would be back in that same village. He was excited, and at the same time uneasy: maybe the girl had already forgotten him. Lots of shepherds passed through, selling their wool.</div>

<div class="line_en">The boy mumbled an answer that allowed him to avoid responding to her question. He was sure the girl would never understand. He went on telling stories about his travels, and her bright, Moorish eyes went wide with fear and surprise. As the time passed, the boy found himself wishing that the day would never end, that her father would stay busy and keep him waiting for three days. He recognized that he was feeling something he had never experienced before: the desire to live in one place forever. With the girl with the raven hair, his days would never be the same again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="男孩随便岔开了话题，没有回答。他确信这个问题女孩永远无法理解。他继续讲述路上的经历。女孩那双酷似摩尔人的小眼睛一会儿因害怕而瞪得浑圆，一会儿因惊奇而眯成一条缝。时间流逝，男孩开始期盼这一天永远不要结束，期盼女孩的父亲一直忙碌下去，可以让他在此等上好几天。他感觉自己正生起一种过去从未有过的冲动：永远定居在这个镇子。他感觉，和这个黑头发女孩在一起，每天都会是新的一天。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But finally the merchant appeared, and asked the boy to shear four sheep. He paid for the wool and asked the shepherd to come back the following year.</div>

<div class="line_en">The only things that concerned the sheep were food and water. As long as the boy knew how to find the best pastures in Andalusia, they would be his friends. Yes, their days were all the same, with the seemingly endless hours between sunrise and dusk; and they had never read a book in their young lives, and didn't understand when the boy told them about the sights of the cities. They were content with just food and water, and, in exchange, they generously gave of their wool, their company, and -- once in a while -- their meat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="羊唯一需要的就是食物和水。只要他了解安达卢西亚最好的草场，羊群就将永远跟随他。即使日复一日在日出日落之间苦熬，即使在其短暂的一生中从未读过一本书，也不懂人的语言，听不懂人们讲述的新鲜事，只要有水和食物，它们就心满意足。作为回报，它们慷慨地奉献出羊毛，心甘情愿地陪伴着牧人，时不时还奉献出自己的肉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But in his heart he knew that it did matter. And he knew that shepherds, like seamen and like traveling salesmen, always found a town where there was someone who could make them forget the joys of carefree wandering.</div>

<div class="line_en">The boy was surprised at his thoughts. Maybe the church, with the sycamore growing from within, had been haunted. It had caused him to have the same dream for a second time, and it was causing him to feel anger toward his faithful companions. He drank a bit from the wine that remained from his dinner of the night before, and he gathered his jacket closer to his body. He knew that a few hours from now, with the sun at its zenith, the heat would be so great that he would not be able to lead his flock across the fields. It was the time of day when all of Spain slept during the summer. The heat lasted until nightfall, and all that time he had to carry his jacket. But when he thought to complain about the burden of its weight, he remembered that, because he had the jacket, he had withstood the cold of the dawn.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="男孩对自己的这些念头感到惊讶。也许是因为那座里面长着无花果树的教堂太残破不堪，他又做了一个与以前一样的梦，他开始嫌弃忠诚地陪伴他左右的羊群。他喝了一口酒—这是昨天晚饭时剩下的，然后裹紧外衣。他知道，再过几个小时，太阳就会升到头顶，那时酷热难熬，他就不能领着羊群在旷野赶路了。夏季是整个西班牙睡午觉的季节。酷热会一直持续到入夜。而在酷热降临之前，他不得不一直披着外衣。然而，每当他想抱怨外衣沉重时，总会想起多亏这件衣服，才不会在清晨感到寒冷。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We have to be prepared for change, he thought, and he was grateful for the jacket's weight and warmth.</div>

<div class="line_en">The jacket had a purpose, and so did the boy. His purpose in life was to travel, and, after two years of walking the Andalusian terrain, he knew all the cities of the region. He was planning, on this visit, to explain to the girl how it was that a simple shepherd knew how to read. That he had attended a seminary until he was sixteen. His parents had wanted him to become a priest, and thereby a source of pride for a simple farm family. They worked hard just to have food and water, like the sheep. He had studied Latin, Spanish, and theology. But ever since he had been a child, he had wanted to know the world, and this was much more important to him than knowing God and learning about man's sins. One afternoon, on a visit to his family, he had summoned up the courage to tell his father that he didn't want to become a priest. That he wanted to travel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="外衣自有其存在的理由，而男孩亦有其生活的道理。两年间，他走遍了安达卢西亚的平原大川，把所有的村镇都记在了脑子里，这就是他生活的最大动力。他盘算着，这一次要告诉那女孩，为什么他这样一个普普通通的牧羊人会读书识字：他曾经在一所神学院里待到十六岁。父母希望他成为神甫，成为一个普通农家的骄傲，而他们一生只为吃喝忙碌，就像圣地亚哥的羊群。他学过拉丁文、西班牙文和神学。但是，从孩提时代起，他就梦想着了解世界，这远比了解上帝以及人类的罪孽来得重要。一天下午，回去探望家人的时候，圣地亚哥鼓足勇气告诉父亲，他不想当神甫，他要云游四方。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The horizon was tinged with red, and suddenly the sun appeared. The boy thought back to that conversation with his father, and felt happy; he had already seen many castles and met many women (but none the equal of the one who awaited him several days hence). He owned a jacket, a book that he could trade for another, and a flock of sheep. But, most important, he was able every day to live out his dream. If he were to tire of the Andalusian fields, he could sell his sheep and go to sea. By the time he had had enough of the sea, he would already have known other cities, other women, and other chances to be happy. I couldn't have found God in the seminary, he thought, as he looked at the sunrise.</div>

The world was huge and inexhaustible; he had only to allow his sheep to set the route for a while, and he would discover other interesting things. The problem is that they don't even realize that they're walking a new road every day. They don't see that the fields are new and the seasons change. All they think about is food and water.</div>

<div class="line_en">Maybe we're all that way, the boy mused. Even me -- I haven't thought of other women since I met the merchant's daughter.

There, he could exchange his book for a thicker one, fill his wine bottle, shave, and have a haircut; he had to prepare himself for his meeting with the girl, and he didn't want to think about the possibility that some other shepherd, with a larger flock of sheep, had arrived there before him and asked for her hand.</div>

<div class="line_en">It sounded like a Gypsy prayer. The boy had already had experience on the road with Gypsies; they also traveled, but they had no flocks of sheep. People said that Gypsies spent their lives tricking others.
