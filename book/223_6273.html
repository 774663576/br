<div class="line_en">That Friday made the last of our fine days for a month. In the evening, the weather broke: the wind shifted from south to northeast, and brought rain first, and then sleet and snow. On the morrow one could hardly imagine that there had been three weeks of summer: the primroses and crocuses were hidden under wintry drifts; the larks were silent, the young leaves of the early trees smitten and blackened. And dreary, and chill, and dismal, that morrow did creep over! My master kept his room; I took possession of the lonely parlour, converting it into a nursery: and there I was, sitting with the moaning doll of a child laid on my knee; rocking it to and fro, and watching, meanwhile, the still driving flakes build up the uncurtained window, when the door opened, and some person entered, out of breath and laughing! My anger was greater than my astonishment for a minute. I supposed it one of the maids, and I cried --</div>

<div class="line_en">The intruder was Mrs Heathcliff. She certainly seemed in no laughing predicament: her hair streamed on her shoulders, dripping with snow and water; she was dressed in the girlish dress she commonly wore, befitting her age more than her position: a low frock with short sleeves, and nothing on either head or neck. The frock was of light silk, and clung to her with wet, and her feet were protected merely by thin slippers; add to this a deep cut under one ear, which only the cold prevented from bleeding profusely, a white face scratched and bruised, and a frame hardly able to support itself, through fatigue; and you may fancy my first fright was not much allayed when I had had leisure to examine her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="闯入者是希刺克厉夫夫人。她那情形也实在叫人笑不出来：她的头发披在肩上，给雪和雨淋得直滴水；她穿的是她平常作姑娘时穿的衣服，对她的年龄比对她的身分还适合些；短袖的露胸上衣，头上和脖子上什么也没戴。上衣是薄绸的，透湿地贴在她身上，保护她的脚的只是薄薄的拖鞋；此外，一只耳朵下面还有一道深的伤痕，只因为天冷，才止住了过多的流血，一张被抓过、打过的白白的脸，一个累得都难以支持的身躯，你可以想象，等我定下心来仔细看她时，并没有减去多少我最初的惊恐。">查看中文翻译</div>

Don't be alarmed! There shall be an explanation as soon as I can give it; only just have the goodness to step out and order the carriage to take me on to Gimmerton, and tell a servant to seek up a few clothes in my wardrobe.'</div>

You mustn't think I care little for Catherine, because I behaved so foolishly on entering: I've cried, too, bitterly -- yes, more than anyone else has reason to cry. We parted unreconciled, you remember, and I shan't forgive myself. But, for all that, I was not going to sympathize with him -- the brute beast! Oh, give me the poker! This is the last thing of his I have about me.' She slipped the gold ring from her third finger, and threw it on the floor. `I'll smash it!' she continued, striking it with childish spite, `and then I'll burn it!' and she took and dropped the misused article among the coals. `There! he shall buy another, if he gets me back again. He'd be capable of coming to seek me, to tease Edgar. I dare not stay, lest that notion should possess his wicked head! And besides, Edgar has not been kind, has he? And I won't come suing for his assistance; nor will I bring him into more trouble. Necessity compelled me to seek shelter here; though, if I had not learned he was out of the way, I'd have halted at the kitchen, washed my face, warmed myself, got you to bring what I wanted, and departed again to anywhere out of the reach of my accursed -- of that incarnate goblin! Ah! he was in such a fury! If he had caught me! It's a pity Earnshaw is not his match in strength: I wouldn't have run till I'd seen him all but demolished, had Hindley been able to do it!'</div>

<div class="line_en">`I ought, and I wish to remain,' answered she, `to cheer Edgar and take care of the baby, for two things, and because the Grange is my right home. But I Bell you he wouldn't let me! Do you think he could bear to see me grow fat and merry; and could bear to think that we were tranquil, and not resolve on poisoning our comfort? Now, I have the satisfaction of being sure that he detests me, to the point of its annoying him seriously to have me within earshot or eyesight: I notice, when I enter his presence, the muscles of his countenance are involuntarily distorted into an expression of hatred; partly arising from his knowledge of the good causes I have to feel that sentiment for him, and partly from original aversion. It is strong enough to make me feel pretty certain that he would not chase me over England, supposing I contrived a clear escape; and therefore I must get quite away. I've recovered from my first desire to be killed by him: I'd rather he'd kill himself! He has extinguished my love effectually, and so I'm at my ease. I can recollect yet how I loved him; and can dimly imagine that I could still be loving him, if -- no, no! Even if he had doted on me, the devilish nature would have revealed its existence somehow. Catherine had an awfully perverted taste to esteem him so dearly, knowing him so well. Monster! would that he could be blotted out of creation, and out of my memory!'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我应该，我也愿意留下来，”她回答，“也好陪陪埃德加；照料一下孩子，一举两得，而且因为田庄才是我真正的家。可是我告诉你他不准我！你以为他就能眼看我发胖，快乐起来——能想到我们过得很平静，而不打算来破坏我们的舒适吗？现在，使我感到满足的是，我确实知道他憎恨我，而且恨到了这种程度：一听到我，或者看见我，他就十分烦恼，我注意到，当我走到他跟前时，他脸上的肌肉不由自主地扭成憎恨的表情；这几分是由于他知道我有充分的理由憎恨他，几分是出于原来就有的反感。这就足以使我相信，假如我设法逃走，他也不会走遍全英格兰来追我的；因此我一定得走开，我已经不再有我最初那种甘愿被他杀死的欲望了；我宁可他自杀！他很有效地熄灭了我的爱情，所以我很安心。我还记得我曾如何爱过他；也能模模糊糊地想象我还会爱他，如果——不，不，即使他宠爱过我，那魔鬼的天性总会暴露出来的。凯瑟琳完全了解他，却又有一种怪癖，那么一往情深地重视他。怪物！但愿他从人间、从我的记忆里一笔勾销！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">`He's not a human being,' she retorted; `and he has no claim on my charity. I gave him my heart, and he took and pinched it to death, and flung it back to me. People feel with their hearts, Ellen: and since he has destroyed mine, I have not power to feel for him: and I would not, though he groaned from this to his dying day, and wept tears of blood for Catherine! No, indeed, indeed, I wouldn't!' And here Isabella began to cry; but, immediately dashing the water from her lashes, she recommenced. `You asked, what has driven me to flight at last? I was compelled to attempt it, because I had succeeded in rousing his rage a pitch above his malignity. Pulling out the nerves with red-hot pincers requires more coolness than knocking on the head. He was worked up to forget the fiendish prudence he boasted of, and proceeded to murderous violence. I experienced pleasure in being able to exasperate him; the sense of pleasure woke my instinct of self-preservation, so I fairly broke free; and if ever I come into his hands again he is welcome to a signal revenge.</div>

He kept himself sober for the purpose -- tolerably sober: not going to bed mad at six o'clock and getting up drunk at twelve. Consequently he rose, in suicidal low spirits, as fit for the church as for a dance; and instead, he sat down by the fire and swallowed gin or brandy by tumblerfuls.</div>

Whether the angels have fed him, or his kin beneath, I cannot tell; but he has not eaten a meal with us for nearly a week. He has just come home at dawn, and gone upstairs to his chamber; locking himself in -- as if anybody dreamt of coveting his company! There he has continued, praying like a Methodist: only the deity he implored in senseless dust and ashes; and God, when addressed, was curiously confounded with his own black father! After concluding these precious orisons -- and they lasted generally till he grew hoarse and his voice was strangled in his throat -- he would be off again; always straight down to the Grange! I-wonder Edgar did not send for a constable, and give him into custody!

<div class="line_en">`I recovered spirits sufficient to hear Joseph's eternal lectures without weeping, and to move up and down the house less with the foot of a frightened thief than formerly. You wouldn't think that I should cry at anything Joseph could say; but he and Hareton are detestable companions. I'd rather sit with Hindley, and hear his awful talk, than with ``t' little maister'' and his staunch supporter, that odious old man! When Heathcliff is in, I'm often obliged to seek the kitchen and their society, or starve among the damp uninhabited chambers; when he is not, as was the case this week, I establish a table and chair at one comer of the house fire, and never mind how Mr Earnshaw may occupy himself; and he does not interfere with my arrangements. He is quieter now than he used to be, if no one provokes him: more sullen and depressed, and less furious. Joseph affirms he's sure he's an altered man: that the Lord has touched his heart, and he is saved ``so as by fire''. I'm puzzled to detect signs of the favourable change: but it is not my business.</div>

It seemed so dismal to go upstairs, with the wild snow blowing outside, and my thoughts continually reverting to the kirkyard and the new-made grave! I dared hardly lift my eyes from the page before me, that melancholy scene so instantly usurped its place. Hindley sat opposite, his head leant on his hand; perhaps meditating on the same subject. He had ceased drinking at a point below irrationality, and had neither stirred nor spoken during two or three hours. There was no sound through the house but the moaning wind, which shook the windows every now and then, the faint crackling of the coals, and the click of my snuffers as I removed at intervals the long wick of the candle. Hareton and Joseph were probably fast asleep in bed. It was very, very sad: and while I read I sighed, for it seemed as if all joy had vanished from the world, never to be restored.</div>

<div class="line_en">`Most likely, Heathcliff noticed more the truth of what was said, than the spirit of the person who said it. His attention was roused, I saw, for his eyes rained down tears among the ashes, and he drew his breath in suffocating sighs. I stared full at him, and laughed scornfully. The clouded windows of hell flashed a moment towards me; the fiend which usually looked out, however, was so dimmed and drowned that I did not fear to hazard another sound of derision.</div>

The last glimpse I caught of him was a furious rush on his part, checked by the embrace of his host; and both fell locked together on the hearth. In my flight through the kitchen I bid Joseph speed to his master; I knocked over Hareton, who was hanging a litter of puppies from a chair back in the doorway; and, blest as a soul escaped from purgatory, I bounded, leaped, and flew down the steep road; then, quitting its windings, shot direct across the moor, rolling over banks, and wading through marshes: precipitating myself, in fact, towards the beacon light of the Grange.

<div class="line_en">Mr Heathcliff, meeting me one day in the village, inquired where she lived. I refused to tell. He remarked that it was not of any moment, only she must beware of coming to her brother: she should not be with him, if he had to keep her himself. Though I would give no information, he discovered, through some of the other servants, both her place of residence and the existence of the child. Still he didn't molest her: for which forbearance she might thank his aversion, I suppose. He often asked about the infant, when he saw me; and on hearing its name, smiled grimly, and observed:</div>

<div class="line_en">Isabella ceased speaking, and took a drink of tea; then she rose, and bidding me put on her bonnet, and a great shawl I had brought, and turning a deaf ear to my entreaties for her to remain another hour, she stepped on to a chair, kissed Edgar's and Catherine's portraits, bestowed a similar salute on me, and descended to the carriage, accompanied by Fanny, who yelped wild with joy at recovering her mistress. She was driven away, never to revisit the neighbourhood: but a regular correspondence was established between her and my master when things were more settled. I believe her new abode was in the south, near London; there she had a son born, a few months subsequent to her escape. He was christened Linton, and, from the first, she reported him to be an ailing, peevish creature.</div>

<div class="line_en">On the day succeeding Isabella's unexpected visit, I had no opportunity of speaking to my master: he shunned conversation, and was fit for discussing nothing. When I could get him to listen, I saw it pleased him that his sister had left her husband; whom he abhorred with an intensity which the mildness of his nature would scarcely seem to allow. So deep and sensitive was his aversion, that he refrained from going anywhere where he was likely to see or hear of Heathcliff. Grief, and that together, transformed him into a complete hermit: he threw up his office of magistrate, ceased even to attend church, avoided the village on all occasions, and spent a life of entire seclusion within the limits of his park and grounds; only varied by solitary rambles on the moors, and visits to the grave of his wife, mostly at evening, or early morning before other wanderers were abroad. But he was too good to be thoroughly unhappy long. He didn't pray for Catherine's soul to haunt him. Time brought resignation, and a melancholy sweeter than common joy. He recalled her memory with ardent, tender love, and hopeful aspiring to the better world; where he doubted not she was gone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伊莎贝拉突然到来的那天，我没有机会跟我主人说。他回避谈天，而且他的心情不适于讨论任何事情。当我好容易使他听我说话时，我看出他妹妹离开了她丈夫这回事使他很高兴；他对她丈夫憎恶到极点，其深度是他那柔和的天性几乎不能容许的。他的反感是如此痛切而敏锐，以致任何他可能看到或听到希刺克厉夫的地方他决不涉足。悲痛，加上那种反感，把他化为一个道地的隐士，他辞去裁判官的职务，甚至教堂也不去，避免一切机会到村里去，在他的花园之内过着一种完全与世隔绝的生活；只是有时到旷野上独自散散步，去他妻子坟前望望，改变一下生活方式，这还多半在晚间或清早没有游人的时候。但是他太善良了，不会长久地完全不快乐的。他也不祈求凯瑟琳的魂牵梦萦。时间会使人听天由命的，而且带来了一种比日常的欢乐还甜蜜的忧郁。他以热烈、温柔的爱情，以及她将到更好的世界的热望，来回忆她；他毫不怀疑她是到那更好的世界去了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And he had earthly consolation and affections also. For a few days, I said, he seemed regardless of the puny successor to the departed: the coldness melted as fast as snow in April, and ere the tiny thing could stammer a word or totter a step, it wielded a despot's sceptre in his heart. It was named Catherine; but he never called it the name in full, as he had never called the first Catherine short; probably because Heathcliff had a habit of doing so. The little one was always Cathy; it formed to him a distinction from the mother, and yet a connection with her; and his attachment sprang from its relation to her, far more than from its being his own.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而且，在尘世间还有他能得到慰藉和施以情感之处。我说过，有几天他好像并不关心那死去的人留下的小后代，然而这种冷淡就如四月里的雪融化得那么快，在这小东西还不会说出一个字，或是歪歪倒倒走一步之前，她已经盘据了林惇的心。孩子名叫凯瑟琳；可他从来不叫她全名，正如他也从来不用简名叫那头一个凯瑟琳；这大概是因为希刺克厉夫有这样叫她的习惯。这个小东西却总是叫做凯蒂：对他说来这跟她母亲既有区别又有联系，而他对她的宠爱，一大半与其说是由于她是自己的骨肉，还不如说是由于她和凯瑟琳的关系的缘故。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I used to draw a comparison between him and Hindley Earnshaw, and perplex myself to explain satisfactorily why their conduct was so opposite in similar circumstances. They had both been fond husbands, and were both attached to their children; and I could not see how they shouldn't both have taken the same road, for good or evil. But, I thought in my mind, Hindley, with apparently the stronger head, has shown himself sadly the worse and the weaker man. When his ship struck, the captain abandoned his post; and the crew, instead of trying to save her, rushed into riot and confusion, leaving no hope for their luckless vessel. Linton, on the contrary, displayed the true courage of a loyal and faithful soul: he trusted God; and God comforted him. One hoped, and the other despaired: they chose their own lots, and were righteously doomed to endure them. But you'll not want to hear my moralizing, Mr Lockwood: you'll judge as well as I can, all these things: at least, you'll think you will, and that's the same.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我总是拿他和辛德雷·恩萧相比，我想来想去也难以满意地解释出为什么他们在相似的情况下，行为却如此相反。他们都当过多情的丈夫，都疼自己的孩子；我不明白为什么好好坏坏，他们就没走上一条路。但是，我心里想，辛德雷无疑是个比较有理智的人，却表现得更糟更弱。当他的船触礁时，船长放弃了他的职守，而全体船员，不但不试着挽救这条船，却张惶失措，乱作一团，使得他们这条不幸的船毫无获救的希望，相反，林惇倒显出一个忠诚而虔敬的灵魂所具有的真正的勇气，他信赖上帝，而上帝也安慰了他。这一个在希望中，而另一个在绝望中；各自选择了自己的命运，并且自然各得其所。可是你是不会想听我的说教吧，洛克乌德先生，你会跟我一样地判断这一切的。至少，你会认为你自己可以下判断的，那就行了。">查看中文翻译</div>

One can't help missing an old companion: though he had the worst tricks with him that ever man imagined, and has done me many a rascally turn.

<div class="line_en">I confess this blow was greater to me than the shock of Mrs Linton's death: ancient associations lingered round my heart; I sat down in the porch and wept as for a blood relation, desiring Kenneth to get another servant to introduce him to the master. I could not hinder myself from pondering on the question --`Had he had fair play?' Whatever I did, that idea would bother me: it was so tiresomely pertinacious that I resolved on requesting leave to go to Wuthering Heights, and assist in the last duties to the dead. Mr Linton was extremely reluctant to consent, but I pleaded eloquently for the friendless condition in which he lay; and I said my old master and foster-brother had a claim on my services as strong as his own. Besides, I reminded him that the child Hareton was his wife's nephew, and, in the absence of nearer kin, he ought to act as its guardian; and he ought to and must inquire how the property was left, and look over the concerns of his brother-in-law. He was unfit for attending to such matters then, but he bid me speak to his lawyer; and at length permitted me to go. His lawyer had been Earnshaw's also: I called at the village, and asked him to accompany me. He shook his head, and advised that Heathcliff should be let alone; affirming, if the truth were known, Hareton would be found little else than a beggar.</div>

<div class="line_en">I insisted on the funeral being respectable. Mr Heathcliff said I might have my own way there too; only, he desired me to remember that the money for the whole affair came out of his pocket. He maintained a hard, careless deportment, indicative of neither joy nor sorrow; if anything, it expressed a flinty gratification at a piece of difficult work successfully executed. I observed once, indeed, something like exultation in his aspect: it was just when the people were bearing the coffin from the house. He had the hypocrisy to represent a mourner: and previous to following with Hareton, he lifted the unfortunate child on to the table and muttered, with peculiar gusto, `Now, my bonny lad, you are mine! And we'll see if one tree won't grow as crooked as another, with the same wind to twist it!' The unsuspecting thing was pleased at this speech: he played with Heathcliff's whiskers, and stroked his cheek; but I divined its meaning, and observed tartly, `That boy must go back with me to Thrushcross Grange, sir.

<div class="line_en">`Of course -- he has ordered me to take him,' I replied.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然——他叫我来领他的。”我回答。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">`Well,' said the scoundrel, `we'll not argue the subject now: but I have a fancy to try my hand at rearing a young one; so intimate to your master that I must supply the place of this with my own, if he attempt to remove it. I don't engage to let Hareton go undisputed; but I'll be pretty sure to make the other come! Remember to tell him.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，”这个恶棍说，“现在我们不要争辩这件事吧，可是我很想自己带个小孩子；所以通知你主人说，如果他打算带走他，我就得要我自己的孩子补这个缺。我才不会一声不吭地让哈里顿走，可我是一定要那一个回来！记住告诉他吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">`Does Linton say so?' he demanded.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“林惇是这么说的吗？”他质问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This hint was enough to bind our hands. I repeated its substance on my return; and Edgar Linton, little interested at the commencement, spoke no more of interfering I'm not aware that he could have done it to any purpose, had he been ever so willing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个暗示已够使我束手无策了。我回去后，把这话的内容重说了一遍，埃德加·林惇本来就没多大兴趣，就从此不再提及要去干涉了”。就算他有意，我想他也不会成功。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The guest was now the master of Wuthering Heights: he held firm possession, and proved to the attorney -- who, in his turn, proved it to Mr Linton -- that Earnshaw had mortgaged every yard of land he owned, for cash to supply his mania for gaming; and he, Heathcliff, was the mortgagee. In that manner Hareton, who should now be the first gentleman in the neighbourhood, was reduced to a state of complete dependence on his father's inveterate enemy; and lives in his own house as a servant, deprived of the advantage of wages, and quite unable to right himself, because of his friendlessness, and his ignorance that he has been wronged.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="客人如今是呼啸山庄的主人了，他掌握不可动摇的所有权，而且向律师证明——律师又转过来向林惇先生证明——恩萧已经抵押了他所有的每一码土地，换成现款，满足了他的赌博狂；而他，希刺克厉夫，是承受抵押的人。于是，哈里顿原该是附近一带的第一流绅士，却落到完全靠他父亲的多年仇人来养活的地步。他在他自己的家里倒像个仆人一样，还被剥夺了领取工钱的权利；他是翻不了身了，这是由于他的无亲无故，而且自己还根本不知道他在受人欺侮了。">查看中文翻译</div>
