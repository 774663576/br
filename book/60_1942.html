<div class="line_en">Anyone who thinks that the Communist regimes of Central Europe are exclusively the work of criminals is overlooking a basic truth: the criminal regimes were made not by criminals but by enthusiasts convinced they had discovered the only road to paradise. They defended that road so valiantly that they were forced to execute many people. Later it became clear that there was no paradise, that the enthusiasts were therefore murderers.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the end, the dispute narrowed down to a single question: Did they really not know or were they merely making believe?</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="于是人们纷纷指责共产党人：你们要为祖国的灾难负责（如今她贫穷，破败），要为祖国丧失独立负责（她已被俄国人所控制），要为那些以合法的名义杀人的行为负责！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tomas followed the dispute closely (as did his ten million fellow Czechs) and was of the opinion that while there had definitely been Communists who were not completely unaware of the atrocities (they could not have been ignorant of the horrors that had been perpetrated and were still being perpetrated in postrevolutionary Russia), it was probable that the majority of the Communists had not in fact known of them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="托马斯也关注着这场舌战（正如同上千万的其他捷克人一样），他认为在这些共产党人中间，肯定还是有一部分人，他们当时并非一无所知（在后革命时代的俄国曾经发生并一直在不断发生的各种惨事，他们至少应该听说过吧）。不过，大部分人可能是真的什么都不清楚。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Let us concede that a Czech public prosecutor in the early fifties who called for the death of an innocent man was deceived by the Russian secret police and the government of his own country. But now that we all know the accusations to have been absurd and the executed to have been innocent, how can that selfsame public prosecutor defend his purity of heart by beating himself on the chest and proclaiming, My conscience is clear! I didn't know! I was a believer! Isn't his I didn't know! I was a believer! at the very root of his irreparable guilt?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在五十年代初，一个人明明清白，可检察官却强烈要求判处他死刑，姑且承认这个检察官当初是被俄国秘密警察和他自己国家的政府欺骗了。那么现在路人皆知当初的指控是完全荒谬的，被处死的人也都是无辜的，难道这位检察官还可以强调他的灵魂之纯洁，拍着胸脯说：“我的良心是清白的，我不知道，我当时以为是呢！”难道不正是在“我不知道！我当时以为是呢！”的表白中铸成了永远不可弥补的错误吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But, he said to himself, whether they knew or didn't know is not the main issue; the main issue is whether a man is innocent because he didn't know. Is a fool on the throne relieved of all responsibility merely because he is a fool?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="托马斯心里想，根本问题并不是：他们当初到底是知道还是不知道？而是：是不是只要他们不知道就算是无辜？如果王位上坐的是个蠢蛋，那么是否只因为他是个蠢蛋就可推卸自己的一切责任？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was in this connection that Tomas recalled the tale of Oedipus: Oedipus did not know he was sleeping with his own mother, yet when he realized what had happened, he did not feel innocent. Unable to stand the sight of the misfortunes he had wrought by not knowing, he put out his eyes and wandered blind away from Thebes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是托马斯又想起了俄狄浦斯的故事：俄狄浦斯并不知道跟自己同床的女人是自己的母亲，然而当他明白所发生的一切之后，他绝没有感到自己是无辜的。他无法面对因自己的不知而造成的不幸，戳瞎了自己的双眼，黯然离开底比斯！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When Tomas heard Communists shouting in defense of their inner purity, he said to himself, As a result of your not knowing, this country has lost its freedom, lost it for centuries, perhaps, and you shout that you feel no guilt? How can you stand the sight of what you've done? How is it you aren't horrified? Have you no eyes to see? If you had eyes, you would have to put them out and wander away from Thebes!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="托马斯常常听到人们声嘶力竭地为自己灵魂的纯洁性进行辩护，他心里想：由于你们的不知，这个国家丧失了自由，也许将丧失几个世纪，你们还说什么你们觉得是无辜的吗？你们难道还能正视周围的一切？你们难道不会感到恐惧？也许你们没有长眼睛去看！要是长了眼睛，你们该把它戳瞎，离开底比斯！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The analogy so pleased him that he often used it in conversation with friends, and his formulation grew increasingly precise and elegant.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="托马斯很乐意作这种比较，在与朋友的谈话中常常提起，而且表达的方式越来越尖锐，越来越明了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Even the writers' paper merely repeated the same question: Did they know or did they not? Because Tomas found this question second-rate, he sat down one day, wrote down his reflections on Oedipus, and sent them to the weekly. A month later he received an answer: an invitation to the editorial offices. The editor who greeted him was short but as straight as a ruler. He suggested that Tomas change the word order in one of the sentences. And soon the text made its appearance -- on the next to the last page, in the Letters to the Editor section.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在所有这些讨论中，反复涉及同一问题：那些人他们当初到底是知道呢，还是不知道？托马斯一直认为这样的问题是次要的，有一天他终于写下了关于俄狄浦斯的思考，并寄到杂志编辑部。一个月以后他收到了回复。信上请他到编辑部去一趟。接待他的是一位矮小的编辑，身材直挺挺的，像个法文字母i，他建议托马斯把文中的某句话的结构稍作改动。其后不久，此文便刊登在了杂志倒数第二页的“读者来信”栏目中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Like all intellectuals at the time, he read a weekly newspaper published in three hundred thousand copies by the Union of Czech Writers. It was a paper that had achieved considerable autonomy within the regime and dealt with issues forbidden to others. Consequently, it was the writers' paper that raised the issue of who bore the burden of guilt for the judicial murders resulting from the political trials that marked the early years of Communist power.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那个时期，托马斯和其他知识分子一样都读一份由捷克作家联盟发行的周刊，其发行量大约为三十万，在所处的制度下，拥有相当大的自主权，常发表一些其他杂志不能公开发表的言论。这份作家杂志甚至还刊登了一些有关党执政初期发生的政治案件的文章，追究谁是真正的罪魁祸首，以及在何种情况下以合法的名义杀人的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tomas was far from overjoyed. They had considered it necessary to ask him to the editorial offices to approve a change in word order, but then, without asking him, shortened his text by so much that it was reduced to its basic thesis (making it too schematic and aggressive). He didn't like it anymore.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但托马斯非常不满。当初他们把他叫到编辑部，说是要求改一个句子的结构，可是之后根本没跟他商量，就对文章大加删削，弄得他的整个思考差不多只剩下个简单化的基本论点（且过于简要，过于激烈），托马斯一点也不高兴。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Two or three months later the Russians decided that free speech was inadmissible in their gubernia, and in a single night they occupied Tomas's country with their army.</div>

<div class="line_en">All this happened in the spring of 1968. Alexander Dubcek was in power, along with those Communists who felt guilty and were willing to do something about their guilt. But the other Communists, the ones who kept shouting how innocent they were, were afraid that the enraged nation would bring them to justice. They complained daily to the Russian ambassador, trying to drum up support. When Tomas's letter appeared, they shouted: See what things have come to! Now they're telling us publicly to put our eyes out!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是发生在一九六八年春季的事。亚历山大·杜布切克正当权，在他周围结集着那些自觉有罪并准备着做些什么来弥补错误的人。但另外一些还高叫着自己无辜的人，他们害怕愤怒的群众会将自己推上法庭，每天都要去俄国大使面前抱怨以企求他的支持。正好这时，托马斯的信发表了，这些人立即叫嚷起来：如今到了这个份上！有人竟敢公开写信要求剜去我们的眼睛！">查看中文翻译</div>
