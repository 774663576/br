<div class="line_en">Deanna reached for her cup of coffee with a doubtful look on her face. "Not a chance. My exercise is limited to vacuuming the house every weekend. Can you picture me out there, huffing and puffing? I'd probably have a heart attack."</div>

She kept it cut short, dressed without an excess of vanity, and was, Theresa decided, easily the best person she knew. She was knowledgeable about music and art, and at work, the recordings of Mozart or Beethoven were always flooding out of her office into the chaos of the newsroom. She lived in a world of optimism and humor, and everyone who knew her adored her.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“这正是问题的关键。我们不能征得写信人的首肯，但是我可以和报刊律师先谈谈，我肯定这样做是合法的。我们不会使用他们的真名，只要我们不说是自己写的或泄漏我们是从哪里得到它的，我敢肯定就没有问题。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's a human interest story, Theresa. People love those sorts of things. Besides, there's nothing in there that might be embarrassing to someone. This is a beautiful letter. And remember, this Garrett person sent it in a bottle in the ocean. He had to know it would wash up somewhere."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这是一则每个人都会感兴趣的故事，特丽莎。人们都喜欢读这种东西。除此以外，里面也没有什么令人尴尬的内容。这是一封美好的信。还有，记住，这个名叫盖瑞特的男人将它装在瓶子里，扔进海里。他应该知道它也许会被冲上什么地方。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Theresa did think about the letter as she undressed and got in the shower. She found herself wondering about the man who wrote it-Garrett, if that was his real name. And who, if anyone, was Catherine? His lover or his wife, obviously, but she wasn't around anymore. Was she dead, she wondered, or did something else happen that forced them apart? And why was it sealed in a bottle and set adrift? The whole thing was strange. Her reporter's instincts took over then, and she suddenly thought that the message might not mean anything. It could be someone who wanted to write a love letter but didn't have anyone to send it to. It could even have been sent by someone who got some sort of vicarious thrill by making lonely women cry on distant beaches. But as the words rolled through her head again, she realized that those possibilities were unlikely. The letter obviously came from the heart. And to think that a man wrote it! In all her years, she had never received a letter even close to that. Touching sentiments sent her way had always been emblazoned with Hallmark greeting card logos. David had never been much of a writer, nor had anyone else she had dated. What would such a man be like? she wondered. Would he be as caring in person as the letter seemed to imply?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当特丽莎脱掉衣服去淋浴时，她的确在考虑这封信。她发现自己很想知道那个写信的男人是谁——盖瑞特，如果那是他的真名。而如果真有其人，那个凯瑟琳又是谁呢？他的爱人或妻子，显然是这样，但是她已不在人世了。她死了吗？她想，或是否发生了什么其他事迫使他们不得不分开？为什么他会将这封信密封在一个瓶子里，送它漂洋过海？整个事情都很古怪。最后，她的记者直觉占了上风，她突然想到这封信也许没有什么意义，也可能是某个人想要写封情书，却不知道寄给谁。甚至始作俑者有可能是某个想通过让遥远海滩上的孤独女人流眼泪而从中得到某种间接快感的无聊混账汉。但是当那些文字再一次在她头脑中滚过，她意识到那些都不太可能。那封信很显然是发自内心的。真难想象它是出自一个男人的手笔！她活到现在从来还没有收到一封这样的信，甚至接近的都没有。寄给她的情书上总是装饰着贺卡公司规范用语的标记。戴维向来不会写文章，和她约会过的其他男人也不擅长舞文弄墨。这是个什么样的男人？她想。他会像信里暗示的那样体贴入微、善解人意吗？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She looked at herself in the mirror as she toweled off. Not too bad for a thirty-six-year-old with an adolescent son, she thought to herself. Her breasts had always been smallish, and though it had bothered her when she was younger, she was glad now because they hadn't started to sag or droop like those of other women her age. Her stomach was flat, and her legs were long and lean from all the exercise over the years. Nor did the crow's-feet around the corners of her eyes seem to show as much, though that didn't make any sense. All in all, she was pleased with how she looked this morning, and she attributed her unusually easy acceptance of herself to being on vacation.</div>

<div class="line_en">After putting on a little makeup, she dressed in beige shorts, a sleeveless white blouse, and brown sandals. It would be hot and humid in another hour, and she wanted to be comfortable as she walked around Provincetown. She looked out the bathroom window, saw that the sun had risen even higher, and made a note to pick up some sunscreen. Her skin would burn if she didn't, and she'd learned from experience that a sunburn was one of the quickest ways to ruin a beach trip.</div>

<div class="line_en">Outside on the deck, Deanna had set breakfast on the table. There was cantaloupe and grapefruit, along with toasted bagels. After taking her seat, she spread some low-fat cream cheese on them-Deanna was on one of her endless diets again-and the two of them talked for a long while. Brian was out golfing, as he would be every day this week, and he had to go in the early morning because he was on some sort of medication that Deanna said "does awful things to his skin if he spends too much time in the sun."</div>

<div class="line_en">Brian and Deanna had been together thirty-six years. College sweethearts, they'd married the summer after graduation, right after Brian accepted a job with an accounting firm in downtown Boston. Eight years later Brian became a partner and they bought a spacious house in Brookline, where they had lived alone for the past twenty-eight years.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布莱恩和迪安娜在一起已经三十六年了。他们在大学时就是人人艳羡的情侣，毕业后的同年夏天就步入了婚姻的殿堂，那时布莱恩刚接受了波士顿市中心一家财务公司的工作后。八年后，布莱恩成为了该公司的合伙人，他们在布鲁克莱恩买了栋宽敞的房子，他们过去二十八年都在那里孤独地度过。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They had always wanted children, but after six years of marriage Deanna had yet to become pregnant. They went to see a gynecologist and discovered that Deanna's fallopian tubes had been scarred and that having a child was impossible. They tried to adopt for several years, but the list seemed never-ending, and they eventually gave up hope. Then came the dark years, she once confided to Theresa, a time when the marriage almost failed. But their commitment, though shaken, remained solid, and Deanna turned to work to fill the void in her life. She started at the Boston Times when women were rare and gradually worked her way up the corporate ladder. When she became managing editor ten years ago, she began to take women reporters under her wing. Theresa had been her first student.</div>

Sometimes she responded to questions, other times she reported on the latest child development data and what it meant.

She wrote of the struggles of single motherhood, a subject that seemed to touch a nerve in the lives of Boston women. Unexpectedly, her column had turned her into a local celebrity of sorts. But even though it was fun in the beginning to see her picture above her column, or to receive invitations to private parties, she always had so much going on, she didn't seem to have time to enjoy it.

<div class="line_en">The following day, Theresa and Deanna went into Chatham and had the letter typed in a print shop. Since neither of them had brought their portable computers and Theresa was insistent that the column not include certain information, it seemed like the most logical thing to do. When the column was ready, they faxed it in. It would run in the next day's paper.</div>

<div class="line_en">The rest of the morning and afternoon were spent like the day before-shopping, relaxing at the beach, easy conversation, and a delicious dinner.

<div class="line_en">Four days ago, while I was on vacation, I was listening to some old songs on the radio and heard Sting singing "Message in a Bottle." Spurred to action by his impassioned crooning, I raced to the beach to find a bottle of my own. Within minutes I found one, and sure enough, it had a message inside. (Actually, I didn't hear the song first: I made that up for dramatic effect. But I did find a bottle the other morning with a deeply moving message inside.) I haven't been able to get it off my mind, and although it isn't something I'd normally write about, in a time where everlasting love and commitment seem to be in such short supply, I was hoping you would find it as meaningful as I did.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="四天前，我在度假时，听到收音机里播放一首动听的老情歌，斯汀动情地唱着一首《瓶中信》，他充满激情的低声吟唱促使我采取了行动。我向海滩跑去，想去找一个属于我自己的瓶子。不到几分钟，我还真找到了一个，而且里面也真装着一封信。（实际上，起初我并没有听到那首歌，我只是为了营造出戏剧效果有意编出了那一幕。但是，我的确在一天早上捡到了一个瓶子，里面装着一封感人至深的信。）看完信，我久久不能忘怀，尽管我本人通常不会写这种东西，但是在这个时期，天长地久的爱情和矢志不渝的忠诚似乎严重缺货，因此，我希望亲爱的读者，你们会像我一样发现其中蕴含的深远意义。">查看中文翻译</div>
