<div class="line_en">Together with other monks, Govinda used to spend the time of rest between pilgrimages in the pleasure-grove, which the courtesan Kamala had given to the followers of Gotama for a gift. He heard talk of an old ferryman, who lived one day's journey away by the river, and who was regarded as a wise man by many. When Govinda went back on his way, he chose the path to the ferry, eager to see the ferryman. Because, though he had lived his entire life by the rules, though he was also looked upon with veneration by the younger monks on account of his age and his modesty, the restlessness and the searching still had not perished from his heart.</div>

Searching means: having a goal. But finding means: being free, being open, having no goal. You, oh venerable one, are perhaps indeed a searcher, because, striving for your goal, there are many things you don't see, which are directly in front of your eyes."</div>

I have stuck with this. Nevertheless, I have had many teachers since then. A beautiful courtesan has been my teacher for a long time, and a rich merchant was my teacher, and some gamblers with dice. Once, even a follower of Buddha, travelling on foot, has been my teacher; he sat with me when I had fallen asleep in the forest, on the pilgrimage. I've also learned from him, I'm also grateful to him, very grateful. But most of all, I have learned here from this river and from my predecessor, the ferryman Vasudeva. He was a very simple person, Vasudeva, he was no thinker, but he knew what is necessary just as well as Gotama, he was a perfect man, a saint."</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'm not kidding. I'm telling you what I've found. Knowledge can be conveyed, but not wisdom. It can be found, it can be lived, it is possible to be carried by it, miracles can be performed with it, but it cannot be expressed in words and taught. This was what I, even as a young man, sometimes suspected, what has driven me away from the teachers. I have found a thought, Govinda, which you'll again regard as a joke or foolishness, but which is my best thought. It says: The opposite of every truth is just as true! That's like this: any truth can only be expressed and put into words when it is one-sided. Everything is one-sided which can be thought with thoughts and said with words, it's all one-sided, all just one half, all lacks completeness, roundness, oneness. When the exalted Gotama spoke in his teachings of the world, he had to divide it into Sansara and Nirvana, into deception and truth, into suffering and salvation. It cannot be done differently, there is no other way for him who wants to teach. But theworld itself, what exists around us and inside of us, is never one-sided. A person or an act is never entirely Sansara or entirely Nirvana, a person is never entirely holy or entirely sinful. It does really seem like this, because we are subject to deception, as if time was something real. Time is not real, Govinda, I have experienced this often and often again. And if time is not real, then the gap which seems to be between the world and the eternity, between suffering and blissfulness, between evil and good, is also a deception.""How come?" asked Govinda timidly."Listen well, my dear, listen well! The sinner, which I am and which you are, is a sinner, but in times to come he will be Brahma again, he will reach the Nirvana, will be Buddha-and now see: these "times to come" are a deception, are only a parable! The sinner is not on his way to become a Buddha, he is not in the process of developing, though our capacity for thinking does not know how else to picture these things. No, within the sinner is now and today already the future Buddha, his future is already all there, you have to worship in him, in you, in everyone the Buddha which is coming into being, the possible, the hidden Buddha. The world, my friend Govinda, is not imperfect, or on a slow path towards perfection: no, it is perfect in every moment, all sin already carries the divine forgiveness in itself, all small children already have the old person in themselves, all infants already have death, all dying people the eternal life. It is not possible for any person to see how far another one has already progressed on his path; in the robber and dice-gambler, the Buddha is waiting; in the Brahman, the robber is waiting. In deep meditation, there is the possibility to put time out of existence, to see all life which was, is, and will be as if it was simultaneous, and there everything is good, everything is perfect, everything is Brahman. Therefore, I see whatever exists as good, death is to me like life, sin like holiness, wisdom like foolishness, everything has to be as it is, everything only requires my consent, only my willingness, my loving agreement, to be good for me, to do nothing but work for my benefit, to be unable to ever harm me. I have experienced on my body and on my soul that I needed sin very much, I needed lust, the desire for possessions, vanity, and needed the most shameful despair, in order to learn how to give up all resistance, in order to learn how to love the world, in order to stop comparing it to some world I wished, I imagined, some kind of perfection I had made up, but to leave it asit is and to love it and to enjoy being a part of it. -- These, oh Govinda, are some of the thoughts which have come into my mind."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我没有开玩笑。我说的正是我所发现的道理。知识可以传授，而智慧却不能。人可以发现它，可以体验它，可以享有它，可以用它来创造奇迹，但是却不能讲述和传授它。这便是我年轻时就已经预感到，并且离开了那些老师的原因。我发现了一个想法，戈文达，你又会以为是开玩笑或愚蠢行为，但其实是我最好的想法。那就是：每一个真理的反面也同样是真实的！也就是说，一个真理如果是片面的，那就要挂在嘴边说个不停。可以用思想去想或用言语去说的一切都是片面的。一切都是片面的，一切都不完整，一切都缺少完备、圆满和统一。戈塔马在讲经时谈到这个世界，不得不把它分为轮回和涅槃，立地成佛——可是你瞧：这个‘总有一天’是错觉，仅仅是比喻！罪人并没有走在成佛的路上，他并没有处在发展之中，尽管我们的思维不能把事物想象成别的样子。不，在罪人身上，现在和今天就已经有了将来的佛，他的前途已经全都在这里，你得在他身上、在你身上、在每个人身上敬奉这个未来的、可能的、隐形的佛。戈文达，尘世并不是不完善，或是正处在一条缓慢通向完美的路上：不，它在每一瞬间都是完美的，一切罪孽本身就已经蕴含着宽恕，所有小孩本身就已经蕴含着老人，所有婴儿都蕴含着死亡，所有濒死者都蕴含着永恒的生命。没有一个人能从另一个人身上看到他已在自己的路上走了多远，强盗和赌徒可能成佛，婆罗门则可能成为强盗。在深沉的冥想中有可能取消时间，把一切过去的、现在的和将来的生活都看作是同时的，于是一切都很好，一切都很完美，一切都属于婆罗门。因此，我觉得凡存在的都是好的，我觉得死跟生一样，罪孽跟圣洁一样，聪明跟愚蠢一样，一切都肯定如此，一切都只需要我的赞成，我的同意，我的欣然认可，因而对我来说是好的，决不会伤害我。我从自己的身体和心灵体会到，我十分需要罪孽，需要肉欲，需要追求财富，需要虚荣，需要最为可耻的绝望，以便学会放弃抗争，学会爱这个世界，不再拿它与某个我所希望的、臆想的世界相比，与一种我凭空臆造的完美相比，而是听其自然，爱它，乐意从属于它。哦，戈文达，这就是我想到的一些想法。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"This here," he said playing with it, "is a stone, and will, after a certain time, perhaps turn into soil, and will turn from soil into a plant or animal or human being. In the past, I would have said: This stone is just a stone, it is worthless, it belongs to the world of the Maja; but because it might be able to become also a human being and a spirit in the cycle of transformations, therefore I also grant it importance. Thus, I would perhaps have thought in the past. But today I think: this stone is a stone, it is also animal, it is also god, it is also Buddha, I do not venerate and love it because it could turn into this or that, but rather because it is already and always everything -- and it is this very fact, that it is a stone, that it appears to me now and today as a stone, this is why I love it and see worth and purpose in each of its veins and cavities, in the yellow, in the gray, in the hardness, in the sound it makes when I knock at it, in the dryness or wetness of its surface. There are stones which feel like oil or soap, and others like leaves, others like sand, and every one is special and prays the Om in its own way, each one is Brahman, but simultaneously and just as much it is a stone, is oily or juicy, and this is this very fact which I like and regard as wonderful and worthy of worship. -- But let me speak no more of this. The words are not good for the secret meaning, everything always becomes a bit different, as soon as it is put into words, gets distorted a bit, a bit silly-yes, and this is also very good, and I like it a lot, I also very much agree with this, that this what is one man's treasure and wisdom always sounds like foolishness to another person."</div>

To be honest, I also have no high opinion of thoughts. I have a better opinion of things. Here on this ferry-boat, for instance, a man has been my predecessor and teacher, a holy man, who has for many years simply believed in the river, nothing else. He had noticed that the river's spoke to him, he learned from it, it educated and taught him, the river seemed to be a god to him, for many years he did not know that every wind, every cloud, every bird, every beetle was just as divine and knows just as much and can teach just as much as the worshipped river.

<div class="line_en">"I know it," said Siddhartha; his smile shone golden. "I know it, Govinda. And behold, with this we are right in the middle of the thicket of opinions, in the dispute about words. For I cannot deny, my words of love are in a contradiction, a seeming contradiction with Gotama's words. For this very reason, I distrust in words so much, for I know, this contradiction is a deception. I know that I am in agreement with Gotama. How should he not know love, he, who has discovered all elements of human existence in their transitoriness, in their meaninglessness, and yet loved people thus much, to use a long, laborious life only to help them, to teach them! Even with him, even with your great teacher, I prefer the thing over the words, place more importance on his acts and life than on his speeches, more on the gestures of his hand than his opinions. Not in his speech, not in his thoughts, I see his greatness, only in his actions, in his life."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我知道，”席特哈尔塔说，他的笑容闪现出金光。“我知道，戈文达。你瞧，咱们现在又陷入意见分歧，陷入言词之争了。我不能否论，我这些关于爱的言论与戈塔马的话有矛盾，有显然的矛盾。正因为如此，我才十分怀疑言词，因为我知道这种矛盾是错觉。我知道，我和戈塔马是一致的。怎么会连他也不了解爱呢？他熟知一切人性的暂时性和虚无性，却依然这样热爱人们，让漫长而艰难的一生完全致力于帮助他们，教导他们！在他身上，在你这位伟大的导师身上，我觉得也是事物胜于言词，他的行动和生活比他的言论更重要，他的手势比他的见解更重要。我认为他的伟大不在于言论，不在于思想，而在于行动，在于生活之中。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For a long time, the two old men said nothing. Then spoke Govinda, while bowing for a farewell: "I thank you, Siddhartha, for telling me some of your thoughts. They are partially strange thoughts, not all have been instantly understandable to me. This being as it may, I thank you, and I wish you to have calm days."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两个老人沉默了很久。后来，戈文达鞠躬道别，说：“我感谢你，席特哈尔塔，感谢你给我讲了你的想法。它们有些是很奇特的想法，我一下子没全听懂。别管它了，我感谢你，祝你生活平安！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">(But secretly he thought to himself: This Siddhartha is a bizarre person, he expresses bizarre thoughts, his teachings sound foolish. So differently sound the exalted one's pure teachings, clearer, purer, more comprehensible, nothing strange, foolish, or silly is contained in them. But different from his thoughts seemed to me Siddhartha's hands and feet, his eyes, his forehead, his breath, his smile, his greeting, his walk. Never again, after our exalted Gotama has become one with the Nirvana, never since then have I met a person of whom I felt: this is a holy man! Only him, this Siddhartha, I have found to be like this. May his teachings be strange, may his words sound foolish; out of his gaze and his hand, his skin and his hair, out of every part of him shines a purity, shines a calmness, shines a cheerfulness and mildness and holiness, which I have seen in no other person since the final death of our exalted teacher.)</div>

<div class="line_en">But while Govinda with astonishment, and yet drawn by great love and expectation, obeyed his words, bent down closely to him and touched his forehead with his lips, something miraculous happened to him. While his thoughts were still dwelling on Siddhartha's wondrous words, while he was still struggling in vain and with reluctance to think away time, to imagine Nirvana and Sansara as one, while even a certain contempt for the words of his friend was fighting in him against an immense love and veneration, this happened to him:</div>

<div class="line_en">He no longer saw the face of his friend Siddhartha, instead he saw other faces, many, a long sequence, a flowing river of faces, of hundreds, of thousands, which all came and disappeared, and yet all seemed to be there simultaneously, which all constantly changed and renewed themselves, and which were still all Siddhartha. He saw the face of a fish, a carp, with an infinitely painfully opened mouth, the face of a dying fish, with fading eyes-he saw the face of a new-born child, red and full of wrinkles, distorted from crying-he saw the face of a murderer, he saw him plunging a knife into the body of another person-he saw, in the same second, this criminal in bondage, kneeling and his head being chopped off by the executioner with one blow of his sword-he saw the bodies of men and women, naked in positions and cramps of frenzied love-he saw corpses stretched out, motionless, cold, void -- he saw the heads of animals, of boars, of crocodiles, of elephants, of bulls, of birds-he saw gods, saw Krishna, saw Agni-he saw all of these figures and faces in a thousand relationships with one another, each one helping the other, loving it, hating it, destroying it, giving re-birth to it, each one was a will to die, a passionately painful confession of transitoriness, and yet none of them died, each one only transformed, was always re-born, received evermore a new face, without any time having passed between the one and the other face-and all of these figures and faces rested, flowed, generated themselves, floated along and merged with each other, and they were all constantly covered by something thin, without individuality of its own, but yet existing, like a thin glass or ice, like a transparent skin, a shell or mold or mask of water, and this mask was smiling, and this mask was Siddhartha's smiling face, which he, Govinda, in this very same moment touched with his lips. And, Govinda saw it like this, this smile of the mask, this smile of oneness above the flowing forms, this smile of simultaneousness above the thousand births and deaths, this smile of Siddhartha was precisely the same, was precisely of the same kind as the quiet, delicate, impenetrable, perhaps benevolent, perhaps mocking, wise, thousand-fold smile of Gotama, the Buddha, as he had seen it himself with great respect a hundred times. Like this, Govinda knew, the perfected ones are smiling.</div>

The face was unchanged, after under its surface the depth of the thousandfoldness had closed up again, he smiled silently, smiled quietly and softly, perhaps very benevolently, perhaps very mockingly, precisely as he used to smile, the exalted one.</div>
