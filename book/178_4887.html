<div class="line_en">Just then the fish gave a sudden lurch that pulled the old man down onto the bow and would have pulled him overboard if he had not braced himself and given some line. The bird had flown up when the line jerked and the old man had not even seen him go. He felt the line carefully with his right hand and noticed his hand was bleeding. "Something hurt him then," he said aloud and pulled back on the line to see if he could turn the fish. But when he was touching the breaking point he held steady and settled back against the strain of the line.</div>

<div class="line_en">The hawks, he thought, that come out to sea to meet them. But he said nothing of this to the bird who could not understand him anyway and who would learn about the hawks soon enough. "Take a good rest, small bird," he said. "Then go in and take your chance like any man or bird or fish." It encouraged him to talk because his back had stiffened in the night and it hurt truly now. "Stay at my house if you like, bird," he said. "I am sorry I cannot hoist the sail and take you in with the small breeze that is rising. But I am with a friend."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他想，一定是有老鹰出海捕捉小鸟。但是他没有对小鸟说，因为它反正也不会懂，而且它很快就会见识到了。「小鸟儿啊！好好休息吧。」他说：「接下来，你就得再启程去碰碰运气，就像任何一个人、一只鸟、或一条鱼一样。」他的背经过一夜已经僵硬了，现在正发着要命的疼痛，使得他直想开口说话。「鸟啊，只要你喜欢的话就留在我的屋子里好了，」他说。「我很抱歉没办法乘着微风把帆升起来，把你接进来，因为我正陪着一个朋友呢。」">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You're feeling it now, fish," he said. "And so, God knows, am I." He looked around for the bird now because he would have liked him for company. The bird was gone. You did not stay long, the man thought. But it is rougher where you are going until you make the shore. How did I let the fish cut me with that one quick pull he made? I must be getting very stupid. Or perhaps I was looking at the small bird and thinking of him. Now I will pay attention to my work and then I must eat the tuna so that I will not have a failure of strength.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「鱼啊！你现在开始有感觉了吧！」他说。「上帝知道，我也一样有感觉了。」他四周张望寻找那只鸟儿的踪迹，如果一直有它作伴该有多好。但是，鸟儿已消失的无影无踪了。老人心想，你在这儿没停留多久就走了。但是，在你飞上岸边之前，你所去的任何地方都比这儿艰险。我怎么会让鱼才猛拉了那么一下就弄出一个伤口来呢？我一定是愈来愈笨了。或许是因为我把视线和注意力放在那只小鸟上的关系吧。从现在开始，我要全神贯注在我的工作上，而且我必须吃鲔鱼，来保持体力。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I wish the boy were here and that I had some salt," he said aloud. Shifting the weight of the line to his left shoulder and kneeling carefully he washed his hand in the ocean and held it there, submerged, for more than a minute watching the blood trail away and the steady movement of the water against his hand as the boat moved. "He has slowed much," he said. The old man would have liked to keep his hand in the salt water longer but he was afraid of another sudden lurch by the fish and he stood up and braced himself and held his hand up against the sun.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「真希望小男孩能在这里，而且真希望我还带了些盐来。」他大声地说。他把绳索的重量转移到左边的肩膀上，小心地跪下，在海中洗手。然后他把手浸在水里大约有一分钟久，随着船向前移动，海水静静地冲着他的手，他凝视着血丝在水中愈行愈远的痕迹。「它已经游得慢多了。」他说。老人很想让手在盐水里泡久一点，但他担心那条鱼又会突然间动起来，于是他站起来，稳住身体，将手朝着太阳举了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was only a line burn that had cut his flesh. But it was in the working part of his hand. He knew he would need his hands before this was over and he did not like to be cut before it started. "Now," he said, when his hand had dried, "I must eat the small tuna. I can reach him with the gaff and eat him here in comfort." He knelt down and found the tuna under the stern with the gaff and drew it toward him keeping it clear of the coiled lines.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="只不过是绷紧的绳索割伤到皮肉而已，但那却是工作时最需要的部位。他晓得在这一场战斗还没结束之前，他需要他的双手，所以很不喜欢在还没开始之前就把手给割伤了。手干了之后，他说：「现在呢，我必须吃那条小鲔鱼了，我可以用鱼叉钩到它，然后在这里舒舒服服地吃。」他跪下来，在船尾下找到那条鲔鱼，用鱼叉将它地朝自己拖过小心翼翼地避开旁边的一盘鱼线。">查看中文翻译</div>
