<div class="line_en">But the museum that I would least like to spend a day in is the Museo della Tortura e di Criminologia Medievale in San Gimignano, Italy. According to a helpful review in www. tripadvisor. com, "The cost is €8,00. Pretty steep for a dozen or so small rooms totalling no more than 100-150 items. If you're into the macabre, though, you should not pass it by. Originals and reproductions of instruments of torture and execution are housed in moodily-lit stone-walled rooms. Each item is accompanied by excellent written descriptions in Italian, French, and English. No details are spared, including which orifice the device was meant for, which limb it was meant to dislocate, who was the usual customer and how the victim would suffer and/or die."</div>

<div class="line_en">I think even the most atrocity-jaded readers of recent history would find something to shock them in this display of medieval cruelty. There is Judas's Cradle, used in the Spanish Inquisition: the naked victim was bound hand and foot, suspended by an iron belt around the waist, and lowered onto a sharp wedge that penetrated the anus or vagina; when victims relaxed their muscles, the point would stretch and tear their tissues. The Virgin of Nuremberg was a version of the iron maiden, with spikes that were carefully positioned so as not to transfix the victim's vital organs and prematurely end his suffering. A series of engravings show victims hung by the ankles and sawn in half from the crotch down; the display explains that this method of execution was used all over Europe for crimes that included rebellion, witchcraft, and military disobedience. The Pear is a split, spike-tipped wooden knob that was inserted into a mouth, anus, or vagina and spread apart by a screw mechanism to tear the victim open from the inside; it was used to punish sodomy, adultery, incest, heresy, blasphemy, and "sexual union with Satan." The Cat's Paw or Spanish Tickler was a cluster of hooks used to rip and shred a victim's flesh. Masks of Infamy were shaped like the head of a pig or an ass; they subjected a victim both to public humiliation and to the pain of a blade or knob forced into their nose or mouth to prevent them from wailing. The Heretic's Fork had a pair of sharp spikes at each end: one end was propped under the victim's jaw and the other at the base of his neck, so that as his muscles became exhausted he would impale himself in both places.</div>

<div class="line_en">Torture, of course, is not a thing of the past. It has been carried out in modern times by police states, by mobs during ethnic cleansings and genocides, and by democratic governments in interrogations and counterinsurgency operations, most infamously during the administration of George W. Bush following the 9/11 attacks. But the sporadic, clandestine, and universally decried eruptions of torture in recent times cannot be equated with the centuries of institutionalized sadism in medieval Europe. Torture in the Middle Ages was not hidden, denied, or euphemized. It was not just a tactic by which brutal regimes intimidated their political enemies or moderate regimes extracted information from suspected terrorists. It did not erupt from a frenzied crowd stirred up in hatred against a dehumanized enemy. No, torture was woven into the fabric of public life. It was a form of punishment that was cultivated and celebrated, an outlet for artistic and technological creativity. Many of the instruments of torture were beautifully crafted and ornamented. They were designed to inflict not just physical pain, as would a beating, but visceral horrors, such as penetrating sensitive orifices, violating the bodily envelope, displaying the victim in humiliating postures, or putting them in positions where their own flagging stamina would increase their pain and lead to disfigurement or death. Torturers were the era's foremost experts in anatomy and physiology, using their knowledge to maximize agony, avoid nerve damage that might deaden the pain, and prolong consciousness for as long as possible before death. When the victims were female, the sadism was eroticized: the women were stripped naked before being tortured, and their breasts and genitals were often the targets. Cold jokes made light of the victims' suffering. In France, Judas's Cradle was called "The Nightwatch" for its ability to keep a victim awake. A victim might be roasted alive inside an iron bull so his screams would come out of the bull's mouth, like the bellowing of a beast. A man accused of disturbing the peace might be forced to wear a Noisemaker's Fife, a facsimile of a flute or trumpet with an iron collar that went around his neck and a vise that crushed the bones and joints of his fingers. Many torture devices were shaped like animals and given whimsical names.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，酷刑也不是过去才有的东西。当代警察国家一直在使用酷刑，在种族清洗和种族屠杀中，匪帮也在使用酷刑。而民主国家在侦讯与平暴行动中也会动用酷刑，最臭名昭著的例子就是小布什政府在“9·11”恐怖袭击事件之后的所作所为。但是，最近以来发生的零星的、秘密的并受到举世谴责的酷刑事件完全不能和中世纪欧洲历经数百年的制度化残暴相提并论。酷刑在中世纪不用隐藏、不受非议，亦无须婉语修饰。它不仅仅是一种战术，残暴政权以此恐吓政敌，温和政府则用其从恐怖嫌疑分子那里榨取情报。它不是被煽动起来的疯狂大众的心血来潮。酷刑已经融入人们的公共生活。它还是一种逐渐培育并得到祝福的惩戒方式，是艺术创造性和技术发明的一个宣泄口。许多酷刑的刑具做工精良、装饰华美。设计它们，不是仅仅要造成肉体的痛苦，一顿暴打也能制造足够的痛苦，而酷刑还要激发人们内心的恐惧，诸如刺入身体的某些孔穴，在人体的皮囊里翻搅，将受刑人以屈辱的姿势昭示大众，或者将他们放在某种位置，当他们体力耗竭支撑不住的时候，痛楚剧增，不是被刑具断肢毁容，就是丧命。酷刑行刑人是他们所在时代顶级的解剖学和生理学专家，他们利用他们的知识让痛苦最大化，避免造成让受刑人失去痛感的神经损害，尽量在死亡前延长意识清醒的时间。如果受刑人是女性，残暴还要被色情化：妇女在受刑前被剥光衣服，她们的乳房和阴部往往是施刑的目标。冷笑话对受害者的苦难毫无同情。在法国，“犹大的摇篮”被称为“守夜人”，因为受刑人不能入睡。受刑人可以被装在一只铁牛里活活烧烤，他的嘶喊声从牛嘴里传出来，仿佛是野兽在嚎叫。一个被指控扰乱治安的人，可以被迫戴上“喧嚣者的长笛”，即一种模仿长笛或小号形状的刑具，一头是一个铁项圈套在受刑人的脖子上，刑具上有夹碎手指骨和关节的钳子。许多酷刑装置被做成动物的形状，再加上一个怪诞的名字。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Medieval Christendom was a culture of cruelty. Torture was meted out by national and local governments throughout the Continent, and it was codified in laws that prescribed blinding, branding, amputation of hands, ears, noses, and tongues, and other forms of mutilation as punishments for minor crimes. Executions were orgies of sadism, climaxing with ordeals of prolonged killing such as burning at the stake, breaking on the wheel, pulling apart by horses, impalement through the rectum, disembowelment by winding a man's intestines around a spool, and even hanging, which was a slow racking and strangulation rather than a quick breaking of the neck. Sadistic tortures were also inflicted by the Christian church during its inquisitions, witch hunts, and religious wars. Torture had been authorized by the ironically named Pope Innocent IV in 1251, and the order of Dominican monks carried it out with relish. As the Inquisition coffee table book notes, under Pope Paul IV (1555-59), the Inquisition was "downright insatiable -- Paul, a Dominican and one-time Grand Inquisitor, was himself a fervent and skilled practitioner of torture and atrocious mass murders, talents for which he was elevated to sainthood in 1712."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="中世纪基督教王国的文化就是残忍。欧洲大陆各地的中央政府和地方政府都在执行酷刑，成文法中明确写有对轻罪的处罚，包括剜目、烙印、割手、割耳、割鼻、割舌和其他残害身体的刑罚。死刑则是残忍的极致，延长行刑折磨的方式有火刑、轮刑、五马分尸，穿透直肠的刺穿刑，开膛剖腹将肠子绕成一卷；甚至绞刑，也是慢慢吊起、慢慢窒息，而不是快速拉断颈项。基督教教会在宗教审判、驱巫和宗教战争期间，亦大施残忍的酷刑。最有讽刺意味的是，名为英诺森（意思是“清白无辜”）四世的教皇在1251年批准实施酷刑，多明我会的修士们兴致盎然地执行了这一敕令。装帧精美的大开本休闲书籍《宗教审判》（Inquisition）中提到，在教皇保罗四世（1555—1559）治下，宗教审判“无休无止——保罗，一位多明我会修士，一度做过宗教审判大审判长，本人就是一位技术娴熟的酷刑行刑人、残暴的集体屠杀的刽子手。他热衷此道并才华出众，1712年为此而被封圣”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Torture was not just a kind of rough justice, a crude attempt to deter violence with the threat of greater violence. Most of the infractions that sent a person to the rack or the stake were nonviolent, and today many are not even considered legally punishable, such as heresy, blasphemy, apostasy, criticism of the government, gossip, scolding, adultery, and unconventional sexual practices. Both the Christian and secular legal systems, inspired by Roman law, used torture to extract a confession and thereby convict a suspect, in defiance of the obvious fact that a person will say anything to stop the pain. Torture used to secure a confession is thus even more senseless than torture used to deter, terrorize, or extract verifiable information such as the names of accomplices or the location of weapons. Nor were other absurdities allowed to get in the way of the fun. If a victim was burned by fire rather than spared by a miracle, that was taken as proof that he was guilty. A suspected witch would be tied up and thrown into a lake: if she floated, it proved she was a witch and she would then be hanged; if she sank and drowned, it proved she had been innocent.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="酷刑不只是一种粗暴的正义、一种用更大的暴力阻止暴力的蛮横尝试。大部分被送上绞刑架和火刑架的罪犯都是非暴力犯罪，按照今天的标准，他们中的许多人甚至不应该受任何法律惩罚，比如异端、渎圣、叛教、批评政府、八卦、脏话、通奸和非正统性行为。基督教教廷和世俗权力的法律系统都受罗马法启发，为获取忏悔动用酷刑，并根据这样的忏悔判处被告有罪，完全无视一个明显的事实，就是一个人为了停止剧烈的痛苦，可以承认任何罪行。比起用酷刑阻止、恐吓和榨取可以验证的情报，比如案犯的名字或武器的地点，酷刑用于确保忏悔，实在是更加荒唐。没有哪一种裁决比下面的情况更荒诞了。如果一位罪犯在火刑中被烧死了，没有奇迹发生挽救他的性命，那就证明他是有罪的。一位疑为女巫的女子在捆缚手脚后被沉塘，如果她浮在水面上，说明她是女巫，她会被处以绞刑；如果她沉下去淹死了，就证明她是无辜的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Far from being hidden in dungeons, torture-executions were forms of popular entertainment, attracting throngs of jubilant spectators who watched the victim struggle and scream. Bodies broken on wheels, hanging from gibbets, or decomposing in iron cages where the victim had been left to die of starvation and exposure were a familiar part of the landscape. (Some of these cages still hang from European public buildings today, such as the cathedral of Münster.) Torture was often a participatory sport. A victim in the stocks would be tickled, beaten, mutilated, pelted with rocks, or smeared with mud or feces, sometimes leading to suffocation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="与人们现在的印象完全不同，酷刑的实施并非只限于阴暗的地牢，它们也是大众的娱乐，公开行刑吸引着成群结队的群众，在欢呼雀跃中围观受刑人的挣扎和哀号。在轮刑下撕裂破碎的四肢、绞架上坠挂的身体、铁笼中饱受风吹日晒饥饿干渴的罪人，还有他们一点一点死去，再一点一点腐烂的躯体，这些都是当时人们熟识的日常景色，是中世纪地貌风光的组成部分。（欧洲某些公共建筑上至今还悬挂着这样的铁笼，比如在德国的明斯特大教堂。）酷刑经常是一种参与性的运动。被捆在柱子上的受刑人，可以被群众骚扰、殴打、切割、扔石头、糊上泥巴或者粪便——有时甚至因此窒息而死。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Systemic cruelty was far from unique to Europe. Hundreds of methods of torture, applied to millions of victims, have been documented in other civilizations, including the Assyrians, Persians, Seleucids, Romans, Chinese, Hindus, Polynesians, Aztecs, and many African kingdoms and Native American tribes. Brutal killings and punishments were also documented among the Israelites, Greeks, Arabs, and Ottoman Turks. Indeed, as we saw at the end of chapter 2, all of the first complex civilizations were absolutist theocracies which punished victimless crimes with torture and mutilation.</div>

<div class="line_en">This chapter is about the remarkable transformation in history that has left us reacting to these practices with horror. In the modern West and much of the rest of the world, capital and corporal punishments have been effectively eliminated, governments' power to use violence against their subjects has been severely curtailed, slavery has been abolished, and people have lost their thirst for cruelty. All this happened in a narrow slice of history, beginning in the Age of Reason in the 17th century and cresting with the Enlightenment at the end of the 18th.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="本章的主题是人类历史上的一个重大转折，我们终于摆脱了这些令人毛骨悚然的历史。当代西方和世界上的大部分地区已经消除了极刑与肉体惩罚，政府行使暴力对付自己人民的权力受到严格的限制，奴隶制已经被废除，人民对残忍也失去了胃口。所有这一切都是在短暂的历史瞬间发生和完成的，起点是17世纪的“理性时代”，在18世纪末的“启蒙运动”中达到光辉的顶点。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Some of this progress -- and if it isn't progress, I don't know what is -- was propelled by ideas: by explicit arguments that institutionalized violence ought to be minimized or abolished. And some of it was propelled by a change in sensibilities. People began to sympathize with more of their fellow humans, and were no longer indifferent to their suffering. A new ideology coalesced from these forces, one that placed life and happiness at the center of values, and that used reason and evidence to motivate the design of institutions. The new ideology may be called humanism or human rights, and its sudden impact on Western life in the second half of the 18th century may be called the Humanitarian Revolution.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这场进步中——如果有人说这不是进步，那我不知道这能叫什么——一部分是受新思想的引导，它明确地表示必须最大限度地克制甚至废止制度化的暴力。还有一部分进步是受情感的变化所推动，人们对自己的同类开始有了更多的同情心，对同胞的苦难不再无动于衷。由此产生了新的意识形态，它将生命和幸福作为价值的中心，并用理性和事实来推进新制度的设计。这个新的意识形态可以被称为人道主义或人权。在18世纪下半叶，这一新思想对西方世界产生了巨大的冲击，我们称其为“人道主义革命”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Of course no historical change takes place in a single thunderclap, and humanist currents flowed for centuries before and after the Enlightenment and in parts of the world other than the West. But in Inventing Human Rights, the historian Lynn Hunt notes that human rights have been conspicuously affirmed at two moments in history. One was the end of the 18th century, which saw the American Declaration of Independence in 1776 and the French Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen in 1789. The other was the midpoint of the 20th century, which saw the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, followed by a cascade of Rights Revolutions in the ensuing decades (chapter 7).</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，没有一个历史变迁能够功毕一役，人文主义潮流在启蒙运动前后绵延数百年，遍及西方之外的世界各个角落。但是在《不断创新的人权》（Inventing Human Rights）一书中，历史学家林·亨特（Lynn Hunt）表示，历史上曾经有两个时刻，人类大张旗鼓地申明了人的权利，一次是在18世纪末，1776年的美国《独立宣言》和1789年法国的《人权和公民权宣言》；另一次是20世纪中叶，1948年的《世界人权宣言》。《世界人权宣言》后的几十年间，发生了一系列的权利革命事件（见第7章）。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Today the Enlightenment is often mentioned with a sneer. "Critical theorists" on the left blame it for the disasters of the 20th century; theoconservatives in the Vatican and the American intellectual right long to replace its tolerant secularism with the alleged moral clarity of medieval Catholicism. Even many moderate secular writers disparage the Enlightenment as the revenge of the nerds, the naïve faith that humans are a race of pointy-eared rational actors. This colossal amnesia and ingratitude is possible because of the natural whitewashing of history that we saw in chapter 1, in which the reality behind the atrocities of yesteryear is consigned to the memory hole and is remembered only in bland idioms and icons. If the opening of this chapter has been graphic, it is only to remind you of the realities of the era that the Enlightenment put to an end.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="今天，人们提到启蒙运动时经常带着嘲讽的口气。左派的“批判思想家们”认为启蒙运动要对20世纪的灾难负责；梵蒂冈的基督教保守派（theoconservatives）和美国精英右派坚信中世纪的天主教才具有明晰的道德标准，他们迫不及待地要以此取代宽容的世俗主义。甚至很多中间派的非宗教作家也将启蒙运动贬低为书呆子们的复仇，笑话这些书呆子们竟然天真地相信人类是一个具备理性的物种。人们之所以会如此健忘、如此不懂感恩戴德，原因可能是我们在第1章里所说，历史受到自然和时间的洗刷粉饰，往昔暴行的事实，已经被抛进记忆的黑洞，留下来的都是失去原味的谚语和徽章。如果本章开始展示的图片过于生动而令人不安，我只是想提醒大家，不要忘记被启蒙运动所终结的是一个什么样的时代。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As we shall see, the declarations were more than feel-good verbiage; the Humanitarian Revolution initiated the abolition of many barbaric practices that had been unexceptionable features of life for most of human history. But the custom that most dramatically illustrates the advance of humanitarian sentiments was eradicated well before that time, and its disappearance is a starting point for understanding the decline of institutionalized violence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们应该知道，这些宣言绝不仅仅是言辞动人。人道主义革命后，人类才开始废止了许多历史悠久、早已被人们熟视无睹的野蛮行径。本章前面的画面上所展示的那些令人恐怖的、反人道主义的恶俗，却是远在人道主义革命之前就已经被抛弃了。这些习俗消失的时间，也就是我们理解制度性暴力下降的出发点。">查看中文翻译</div>
