<div class="line_en">They went in to luncheon. Charlie, sitting at the head of his table, easily took charge of the conversation. After those first few words of sympathy he treated Kitty, not as though she had just suffered a devastating experience, but rather as though she had come in from Shanghai for a change after an operation for appendicitis. She needed cheering and he was prepared to cheer her. The best way of making her feel at home was to treat her as one of the family. He was a tactful man. He began talking of the autumn race meeting, and the polo -- by Jove, he would have to give up playing polo if he couldn't get his weight down -- and a chat he had had that morning with the Governor. He spoke of a party they had been to on the Admiral's flag-ship, the state of affairs in Canton, and of the links at Lushan. In a few minutes Kitty felt that she might have been away for no longer than a week-end. It was incredible that over there, up country, six hundred miles away only (the distance from London to Edinburgh, wasn't it?) men, women, and children had been dying like flies. Soon she found herself asking about so and so who had broken a collar bone at polo and if Mrs. This had gone home or Mrs. That was playing in the tennis tournament. Charlie made his little jokes and she smiled at them. Dorothy with her faint air of superiority (which now included Kitty and so was no longer slightly offensive, but a bond of union rather) was gently ironic about various persons in the colony. Kitty began to feel more alert.</div>

<div class="line_en">But while she took her part in the conversation, if not with gaiety (for she felt that neither Dorothy nor Charlie with his admirable sense of decorum would approve of that) at least with cheerfulness, Kitty observed her host. In all those weeks during which her fancy had been revengefully occupied with him she had built up in her mind a very vivid impression of him. His thick curling hair was a little too long and too carefully brushed; in order to hide the fact that it was greying, there was too much oil on it; his face was too red, with its network of mauve veins on the cheeks, and his jowl was too massive: when he did not hold his head up to hide it you saw that he had a double chin; and there was something apelike in those bushy, grizzled eyebrows of his that vaguely disgusted her. He was heavy in his movements, and all the care he took in his diet and all his exercise did not prevent him from being fat; his bones were much too well covered and his joints had a middle-aged stiffness. His smart clothes were a little tight for him and a little too young.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯蒂即使不是兴高采烈也是精神愉快地加入到了谈话之中（因为以多萝西和查理任何一人在礼节上的造诣，自然都会对此举表示赞赏），但她还是留心观察着她的这位主人。过去的几个礼拜里，她一直心怀怨毒地琢磨着他的形象，把想象出来的模样牢牢地记在了心里。他浓密的卷发一定比以前长了，梳理得是油光可鉴。为了掩盖头发逐渐灰白的事实，上面抹了过多的发精。脸上紫红色的血管清晰可见，使整个脸看上去红通通的。下颌必定越来越大了，如果不是他特意扬起头来加以掩饰，便会暴露出他其实是双下巴。那对浓密的灰色眉毛几乎让人联想起猿猴，使凯蒂隐隐地感到厌恶。他的动作迟缓沉重，而他为保持体重所做的努力——节食和锻炼，显然毫无成效。他还是胖了，骨头上堆积的肉十分累赘，关节也像典型的中年人一样僵直不灵。他时髦的漂亮礼服对他来说已经略嫌小了，对他这般年纪的人也太年轻了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He was a very handsome man. It was lucky that she knew how worthless he was. Of course she had always admitted that his voice had a winning quality, and his voice was exactly as she remembered it: it made the falseness of every word he said more exasperating; its richness of tone and its warmth rang now in her ears with insincerity and she wondered how she could ever have been taken in by it. His eyes were beautiful: that was where his charm lay, they had such a soft, blue brilliance and even when he was talking balderdash an expression which was so delightful; it was almost impossible not to be moved by them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他是个相当英俊的男人。幸亏她知道他不值一物。她的确一直承认他的声音非常有磁性，现在也依然如此，但这只会让她对他的那些谎话更感到厌恶。醇厚温和的嗓音在她的耳朵里是那么地虚假，她奇怪刚才怎么还听得有滋有味。他的眼睛十分漂亮，这是他的魅力所在。蓝色的眼珠神采奕奕，即便是在他虚情假意、信口开河之时，他的眼神看起来也令人非常愉快。谁要想不被这双眼睛打动恐怕是很难的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But when he came into the drawing-room before luncheon Kitty received quite a shock (this perhaps was why her pallor had been so marked), for she discovered that her imagination had played an odd trick on her: he did not in the least look as she had pictured him. She could hardly help laughing at herself. His hair was not grey at all, oh, there were a few white hairs on the temple, but they were becoming; and his face was not red, but sunburned; his head was very well placed on his neck; and he wasn't stout and he wasn't old: in fact he was almost slim and his figure was admirable -- could you blame him if he was a trifle vain of it? -- he might have been a young man. And of course he did know how to wear his clothes; it was absurd to deny that: he looked neat and clean and trim. Whatever could have possessed her to think him this and that?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而他进到客厅里来时却叫她吃了一惊（这或许是她的脸色显得苍白的原因），看来她的想象力跟她开了个诡异的玩笑。他跟她想象中的没有一点相似之处，这几乎叫她嘲笑起了自己。他的头发一点也没有变灰，呃，鬓角的确是有几根白发，但却十分好看。他的脸色绝没有红通通的迹象，而是呈现出古铜色。他的脖子相当强健，说双下巴那就是胡扯。他既没发福也不显老，事实上简直就是身材健美——你总不能因为他对此有几分得意就来责备他吧——俨然是个年轻小伙儿。当然了，他穿衣服的艺术也相当高超，整个人看起来整洁干净美观——如果否认这一点就太荒谬了。她以前是中了什么魔，会对他这里指摘、那里挑眼？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, I must leave you two young women to your own devices. It's time for me to get back to the office." He paused and then with his friendly, charming eyes on Kitty said to her: "I'm not going to bother you for a day or two till you're rested, but then I want to have a little business talk with you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“呃，我将不得不离开两位年轻的女士了。我想该是我回办公室的时候了。”他停顿了一下，然后那双友善而迷人的眼睛朝凯蒂望了过去，“未来的一两天内我将不会打搅你，让你休息够了。然后我会和你商议一些事务。”">查看中文翻译</div>

All we want you to do now is to get fit and well: isn't that right, Dorothy?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不要认为我会让你把钱浪费在这些法律程序上。相关的事宜我会一一处理。你知道你将有权得到一份抚恤金，我正要和总督大人商谈此事，看看能否经过适宜的争辩，为你谋得更多的利益。你完全可以放心地把这些事全部交给我。千万不要再为这个操心，我们现在需要你做的就是尽快恢复过来。对不对，多萝西？”">查看中文翻译</div>
