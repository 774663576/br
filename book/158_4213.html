<div class="line_en">The gentlemen ran to the farms along the way for provisions, but they did not even find bread, for the defiant peasant had concealed his stores for fear of being pillaged by the soldiers who, having nothing to put between their teeth, took by force whatever they discovered.</div>

<div class="line_en">Toward one o'clock in the afternoon, Loiseau announced that there was a decided hollow in his stomach. Everybody suffered with him, and the violent need of eating, ever increasing, had killed conversation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="午后一点快到了，鸟老板扬言自己的确感到肚子里空得非常厉害。大家久已是和他一样感到痛苦的；这种不断扩大的求食的强烈需要终于关上了他们的话匣子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Growing appetites troubled their minds; and no eating-house, no wine shop showed itself, the approach of the Prussians and the passage of the troops having frightened away all these industries.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吃东西的欲望一步一步增加，使得每一个饿了的人都是心慌的；然而没有人看见一家饭铺子，一家酒铺子，因为法国的饥饿队伍走过之后，又有普鲁士人就要开过来，所有做生意的人都吓跑了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ball-of-Fat, after many attempts, bent down as if seeking something under her skirts. She hesitated a second, looked at her neighbors, then sat up again tranquilly. The faces were pale and drawn. Loiseau affirmed that he would give a thousand francs for a small ham. His wife made a gesture, as if in protest; but she kept quiet. She was always troubled when anyone spoke of squandering money, and could not comprehend any pleasantry on the subject. "The fact is,"said the Count,"I cannot understand why I did not think to bring some provisions with me. "Each reproached him-self in the same way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="羊脂球一连好几次弯着身子，如同在裙子里寻找什么一样。她迟疑了一刹那，望了望同车的人，随后她安安静静挺直了身子。各人的脸上都是苍白的和缩紧的。鸟老板肯定自己可以出一千金法郎去买一只肘子吃。他的妻子如同抗议似的做了一个手势，随后她不动弹了。听到说起乱花钱，她素来是肉疼的，甚至于把有关这类的戏谑也当成了真的，伯爵说：“我在事实上觉得不好受，为什么我先前没有想到带些吃的东西？”每一个人都同样埋怨自己了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">From time to time some one yawned; another immediately imitated him; and each, in his turn, in accordance with his character, his knowledge of life, and his social position, opened his mouth with carelessness or modesty, placing his hand quickly before the yawning hole from whence issued a vapor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不时有人打呵欠了，另一个几乎立刻就摹仿他；每一个人在轮到自己受着影响的时候也都打呵欠了，不过却随着自己的个性和世故以及社会地位，或者带着响声张开嘴巴，或者略略张开随即举起一只手掩住那只吐出热气的大窟窿。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">However, Cornudet had a flask full of rum. He offered it; it was refused coldly. Loiseau alone accepted two swallows, and then passed back the flask saying, by way of thanks:"It is good all the same; it is warming and checks the appetite. "The alcohol put him in good-humor and he proposed that they do as they did on the little ship in the song, eat the fattest of the passengers. This indirect allusion to Ball-of-Fat choked the well-bred people. They said nothing. Cornudet alone laughed. The two good sisters had ceased to mumble their rosaries and, with their hands enfolded in their great sleeves, held themselves immovable, obstinately lowering their eyes, without doubt offering to Heaven the suffering it had brought upon them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而戈尔弩兑却带了一满瓶蔗渣酒，他邀请大家喝一点；大家都冷冷地拒绝了他。只有鸟老板答应喝两滴，后来他在交还酒瓶子的时候道谢了：“这毕竟有用，这教人得点儿暖气，可以骗着人不想什么吃。”酒精教他高兴起来了，他建议照着歌词中小船上的办法：分吃那个最肥胖的旅客。这种直接对着羊脂球而下的隐语，是教那些受过好教育的人感到刺耳的。并没有人回答他；只有戈尔弩兑微笑了一下。两个嬷嬷已经不捏她们的念珠了，双手笼在长大的袖子里不再动弹，坚定地低着眼睛，无疑地把上苍派给她们的痛苦再向上苍回敬。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Finally at three o'clock, when they found them-selves in the midst of an interminable plain, without a single village in sight, Ball-of-Fat bending down quickly drew from under the seat a large basket covered with a white napkin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，是3点了，这时候，车子走到了一片漫无边际的平原中央，看不见一个村子，羊脂球活泼泼地弯下了身子，在长凳底下抽出一个盖着白饭巾的大提蓝。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At first she brought out a little china plate and a silver cup; then a large dish in which there were two whole chickens, cut up and imbedded in their own fruits, and sweetmeats, provisions for three days if they should not see the kitchen of an inn. Four necks of bottles were seen among the packages of food. She took a wing of a chicken and began to eat it delicately, with one of those little biscuits called"Regence"in Normandy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她首先从提篮里取出一只陶质的小盆子，一只细巧的银杯子，随后一只很大的瓦钵子，那里面盛着两只切开了的子鸡，四面满是胶冻，后来旁人又看见提篮里还有好些包着的好东西，蛋糕，水果，甜食，这一切食物是为三天的旅行而预备的，使人简直可以不必和客店里的厨房打交道。在这些食物包裹之间还伸着四只酒瓶的颈子。她取了子鸡一只翅膀斯斯文文同着小面包吃，小面包就是在诺曼底被人叫做“摄政王”的那一种。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But Loiseau with his eyes devoured the dish of chicken. He said:"Fortunately Madame had more pre-caution than we. There are some people who know how to think ahead always."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过鸟老板却用眼睛死死盯着那只盛子鸡的瓦钵子。他说：“真好哟，这位夫人从前比我们考虑得周到。有些人素来是什么都会想到的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She turned toward him, saying:"If you would like some of it, sir? It Is hard to go without breakfast so long."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她抬头向着他说：“您可是想吃一点，先生？从早上饿到现在是够得受的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He saluted her and replied:"Faith, I frankly can-not refuse; I can stand it no longer. Everything goes in time of war, does it not, Madame?"And then casting a comprehensive glance around, he added:"In moments like this, one can but be pleased to find people who are obliging.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他欠一欠身子：“说句真心话。我不拒绝，我再也受不住了。打仗的时候是打仗的样子，可对，夫人？”末后，他向周围用眼光归了一圈接着说：“在这样一种时候，遇见有人为自己帮忙是很快活的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">All looks were turned in her direction. Then the odor spread, enlarging the nostrils and making the mouth water, besides causing a painful contraction of the jaw behind the ears. The scorn of the women for this girl became ferocious, as if they had a desire to kill her and throw her out of the carriage into the snow, her, her silver cup, her basket, provisions and all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所有的眼光都向她射过来了，不久香味散开了，它增强了人的嗅觉，使得人的嘴里浸出大量的口水，而同时腮骨的耳朵底下发生一阵疼痛的收缩。几个贵妇人对这个“姑娘”的轻视变得更猛烈了，那简直像是一种嫉妒心，要弄死她，或者把她连着银杯子和提篮以及种种食品都扔到车子底下的雪里去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He had a newspaper which he spread out on his knees, that no spot might come to his pantaloons, and upon the point of a knife that he always carried in his pocket, he took up a leg all glistening with jelly, put it between his teeth and masticated it with a satisfaction so evident that there ran through the carriage a great sigh of distress.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他带了一张报纸，现在为了不至于弄脏裤子就把它打开铺在两只膝头上，接着再从口袋里取出一柄永不离身的小刀，扳开它用尖子挑着一只满是亮晶晶的胶冻的鸡腿，他用牙齿咬开了它，再带着一阵很明显的满意来咀嚼，使得车子里起了一阵伤心的长叹。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then Ball-of-Fat, in a sweet and humble voice, proposed that the two sisters partake of her collation They both accepted instantly and, without raising their eyes, began to eat very quickly, after stammering their thanks. Cornudet no longer refused the offers of his neighbor, and they formed with the sisters a sort of table, by spreading out some newspapers upon their knees.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是羊脂球用一道谦卑而甜美的声音邀请两个嬷嬷来分尝她的便餐。她俩立即接受了，在含糊道了谢之后，并没有抬起眼睛就很快地吃起来。戈尔弩兑也没有拒绝他身边这位旅伴的赠与，他和两个嬷嬷在膝头上展开好些报纸，构成了一种桌子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The mouths opened and shut without ceasing, they masticated, swallowed, gulping ferociously. Loiseau in his corner was working hard and, in a low voice, was trying to induce his wife to follow his example. She resisted for a long time; then, when a drawn sensation ran through her body, she yielded. Her husband, rounding his phrase, asked their"charming companion"if he might be allowed to offer a little piece to Madame Loiseau.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几张嘴不住地张开来又合拢去，吞着，嚼着，如狼似虎地消纳着。鸟老板坐在角儿上吃个痛快，一面低声劝他的妻子也学他的样子。她抗拒了好半天，随后她肚子里经过一阵往来不断的抽掣，她答应了。这时候，她丈夫用婉转的语句，去请教他们的“旅行良伴”是否允许他取一小块儿转给鸟夫人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She replied:"Why, yes, certainly, sir,"with an amiable smile, as she passed the dish.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她带着和蔼的微笑说：“可以的，当然，先生，”接着她就托起了那只瓦钵子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">An embarrassing thing confronted them when they opened the first bottle of Bordeaux: they had but one cup. Each passed it after having tasted. Cornudet alone, for politeness without doubt, placed his lips at the spot left humid by his fair neighbor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有人拔开第一瓶葡萄酒的塞子了，这时候却发生一件尴尬的事：只有一只杯子。于是只好在一个人喝完以后经过拂拭再传给第二个人。只有戈尔弩兑偏偏把嘴唇去接触羊脂球的酒杯上吮过还没有干的地方，无疑地这是由于表示献媚。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then, surrounded by people eating, suffocated by the odors of the food, the Count and Countess de Breville, as well as Madame and M. Carré-Lamadon, were suffering that odious torment which has preserved the name of Tantalus. Suddenly the young wife of the manufacturer gave forth such a sigh that all heads were turned in her direction; she was as white as the snow without; her eyes closed, her head drooped; she had lost consciousness Her husband, much excited, implored the help of everybody. Each lost his head completely, until the elder of the two sisters, holding the head of the sufferer, slipped Ball-of-Fat's cup between her lips and forced her to swallow a few drops of wine. The pretty little lady revived, opened her eyes, smiled, and declared in a dying voice that she felt very well now. But, in order that the attack might not return, the sister urged her to drink a full glass of Bordeaux, and added:"It is just hunger, nothing more."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时候，卜来韦伯爵两夫妇和迦来－辣马东先生两夫妇，受到这些吃喝着的人的围绕又被食品发散出来的香味弄得呼吸急促，都简直同当达勒一样只好熬受这类可恨的苦刑。忽然间，厂长的青年配偶发出了一声使得好些人回头来望的叹息，她脸色白得和外面的雪一样了，眼睛闭了，额头往下低了：她已经失了知觉。他丈夫急得发痴，恳求大家援救。每一个人都失了主意，这时候，那个年长一些的嬷嬷扶着病人的头，把羊脂球的酒杯塞到病人的嘴唇缝儿里，使她吞了几滴葡萄酒。漂亮的贵妇人动弹了，张开眼睛了，微笑了，并且用一种命在垂危者的声音说自己现在觉得很好了。不过，为了教这种病状不再发作，嬷嬷又强迫她去喝一满杯葡萄酒而且还说道：“这因为饿极了，没有旁的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
