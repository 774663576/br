<div class="line_en">The name of this place was the Red Arrow Lodge, and it was buried in the western Maine mountains, thirty miles from the town of Rangely. It was a good gig, Hallorann thought. The trade wasn't too heavy, it tipped well, and so far there hadn't been a single meal sent back. Not bad at all, considering the season was nearly half over.</div>

<div class="line_en">After he had finished checking over the salads his understudy had made and peeked in on the home-baked beans they were using as appetizers this week, Hallorann untied his apron, hung it on a hook, and slipped out the back door. He had maybe forty-five minutes before he had to crank up for dinner in earnest.</div>

<div class="line_en">He threaded his way between the outdoor bar and the swimming pool (although why anyone would want to use the pool with the lake so handy he would never know), crossed a greensward where a party of four was playing croquet and laughing, and crested a mild ridge. Pines took over here, and the wind soughed pleasantly in them, carrying the aroma of fir and sweet resin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他在露天酒吧和游泳池（他怎么也不明白为什么湖泊这么近，还有人想用水池子）之间插了过去，穿过一片草地——那儿有四个人在打槌球，时不时发出一阵笑声——然后登上了一座缓缓的山岭。山上是一片松林，山风鼓起了一阵松涛，送来了杉树和松脂的芳香。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On the other side, a number of cabins with views of the lake were placed discreetly among the trees. The last one was the nicest, and Hallorann had reserved it for a party of two back in April when he had gotten this gig.</div>

<div class="line_en">The woman was sitting on the porch in a rocking chair, a book in her hands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="女人坐在门廊上的摇椅里，手里捧着一本书。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hallorann was struck again by the change in her. Part of it was the stiff, almost formal way she sat, in spite of her informal surroundings -- that was the back brace, of course. She'd had a shattered vertebra as well as three broken ribs and some internal injuries. The back was the slowest healing, and she was still in the brace… hence the formal posture. But the change was more than that. She looked older, and some of the laughter had gone out of her face. Now, as she sat reading her book, Hallorann saw a grave sort of beauty there that had been missing on the day he had first met her, some nine months ago. Then she had still been mostly girl. Now she was a woman, a human being who had been dragged around to the dark side of the moon and had come back able to put the pieces back together. But those pieces, Hallorann thought, they never fit just the same way again. Never in this world.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈洛伦又一次被她的变化震惊了。部分是由于她僵直、十分正式的坐姿与周围非正式的环境不协调——当然是因为背上装着支撑板。除三条肋骨骨折和几处内脏受伤外，她的脊柱也被打断了。背部康复得最慢，还脱不了支撑板…因此才有那种正襟危坐的样子。但是，变化远远不止这些。她看上去苍老些了，某些笑容永远从她脸上消失了。此时，她坐在那里看书，哈洛伦从她身上看出了一种凝重的美，这是大约九个月前他第一次见到她时她所没有的。那时她基本上，还是个女孩子，现在，她已经是个女人了，一个备尝艰辛之后又将生活的碎片修复的人。但是，哈洛伦想，那些碎片永远也不会复原如初了，今生今世永远不会了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Right down there." She pointed, and Hallorann saw a small figure sitting at the end of the dock. He was wearing jeans rolled up to the knee and a red-striped shirt. Further out on the calm water, a bobber floated. Every now and then Danny would reel it in, examine the sinker and hook below it, and then toss it out again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那儿。”她指了指，哈洛伦看到一个小小的身影坐在船坞的尽头。他穿着红条衫和牛仔裤，裤腿挽到了膝盖上。稍远处，平静的水面上漂着一个浮子，丹尼不时地把它卷上来，查看它下面的坠子和鱼钩，然后又将它抛出去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他们沉默了片刻，温迪微微地晃动着摇椅，哈洛伦的脚伸在门廊栏杆上，抽着烟。一阵微风暗暗地穿过松林向这边吹来，但没有吹乱温迪的头发。她的头发已经剪短了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Right after Labor Day. When Danny and I leave here, we'll be going right on to Maryland to look for a place. It was really the Chamber of Commerce brochure that convinced me, you know. It looks like a nice town to raise a kid in. And I'd like to be working again before we dig too deeply into the insurance money Jack left. There's still over forty thousand dollars. Enough to send Danny to college with enough left over to get him a start, if it's invested right." Hallorann nodded. "Your mom?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“劳动节过后。离开这里后，我和丹尼去马里兰找个地方住。我确实被商会的小册子说服了，你知道。看来那个小城很有利于抚养孩子，另外，我想在杰克留下的保险赔偿金花得不太多之前就工作。现在还剩4万多美元，足够送丹尼上大学和为他独立生活开个端，如果用得正确的话。”哈洛伦点了点头。“你母亲呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>

It don't care. It don't hate you and me, but it don't love us, either. Terrible things happen in the world, and they're things no one can explain. Good people die in bad, painful ways and leave the folks that love them all alone. Sometimes it seems like it's only the bad people who stay healthy and prosper. The world don't love you, but your momma does and so do I. You're a good boy. You grieve for your daddy, and when you feel you have to cry over what happened to him, you go into a closet or under your covers and cry until it's all out of you again.
