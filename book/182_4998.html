<div class="line_en">Meanwhile Trumpkin and the two boys arrived at the dark little stone archway which led into the inside of the Mound, and two sentinel badgers (the white patches on their cheeks were all Edmund could see of them) leaped up with bared teeth and asked them in snarling voices, "Who goes there?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Trumpkin took the torch and went ahead into the dark tunnel. It was a cold, black, musty place, with an occasional bat fluttering in the torchlight, and plenty of cobwebs.

Then at last they saw a light ahead -- light from under a door. And now for the first time they heard voices, for they had come to the door of the central chamber. The voices inside were angry ones. Someone was talking so loudly that the approach of the boys and the Dwarf had not been heard.</div>

I blew it when first I had a breathing space."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“这话你可以一直说下去，直到弥若兹把我们大家都捉去喂他的狗。正如我方才所说，我们已经用古老传说中的一件宝物做了试验，结果全无用处。情况就是这样。俗话说，宝剑折了，还有匕首；古老传说中除了国王和女王，还有别的势力存在。我们为什么不试着求助于别的势力呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No. You're right there," said Nikabrik. "Aslan and the Kings go together. Either Aslan is dead, or he is not on our side. Or else something stronger than himself keeps him back.

<div class="line_en">"And anyway," Nikabrik continued, "what came of the Kings and their reign? They faded too. But it's very different with the Witch. They say she ruled for a hundred years: a hundred years of winter. There's power, if you like. There's something practical."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“再说，国王及其统治的结果又怎么样呢？”尼克布瑞克接着说，“他们也消失了。女巫的情况则大不一样了。传说她统治了上百年——上百个严冬。可以说，那就是能耐！那就是她与众不同之处。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But, heaven and earth!" said the King, "haven't we always been told that she was the worst enemy of all? Wasn't she a tyrant ten times worse than Miraz?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Perhaps," said Nikabrik in a cold voice. "Perhaps she was for you humans, if there were any of you in those days. Perhaps she was for some of the beasts. She stamped out the Beavers, I dare say; at least there are none of them in Narnia now. But she got on all right with us Dwarfs. I'm a Dwarf and I stand by my own people. We're not afraid of the Witch."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“也许是的，”尼克布瑞克冷冷地说，“对你们人类来讲，或许她是的，假如那个时代有你们人类的话；对一些动物来说，多半也是如此——我相信，她把海狸家族打翻在地，又踏上一只脚，至少今天的纳尼亚你是见不到一只海狸了。可是，她与我们小矮人关系一直不错。我是个小矮人，我当然站在自己人的立场上说话。我们不害怕女巫。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The next minute or so was very confused. There was an animal roaring, a clash of steel; the boys and Trumpkin rushed in; Peter had a glimpse of a horrible, grey, gaunt creature, half man and half wolf, in the very act of leaping upon a boy about his own age, and Edmund saw a badger and a Dwarf rolling on the floor in a sort of cat fight. Trumpkin found himself face to face with the Hag. Her nose and chin stuck out like a pair of nut-crackers, her dirty grey hair was flying about her face and she had just got Doctor Cornelius by the throat. At one slash of Trumpkin's sword her head rolled on the floor. Then the light was knocked over and it was all swords, teeth, claws, fists, and boots for about sixty seconds. Then silence.</div>
