She wassure it was very ill-it cried, and fretted, and was all over pimples. So I looked at it directly, and, 'Lord! my dear,' says I, 'it isnothing in the world, but the red gum --' and nurse said just the same. But Charlotte, she would not be satisfied, so Mr. Donavan was sent for; and luckily he happened to just come in from Harley Street, so hestepped over directly, and as soon as ever Mama, he saidjust as we did, that it was nothing in the world but the red gum, andthen Charlotte was easy. And so, just as he was going away again, itcame into my head, I am sure I do not know how I happened to think ofit, but it came into my head to ask him if there was any news. So uponthat, he smirked, and simpered, and looked grave, and seemed to knowsomething or other, and at last he said in a whisper, 'For fear anyunpleasant report should reach the young ladies under your care as totheir sister's indisposition, I think it advisable to say, that Ibelieve there is no great reason for alarm; I hope Mrs. Dashwood willdo very well.'"</div>

<div class="line_en">"That is exactly what I said, my dear. 'Lord!' says I, 'is Mrs. Dashwood ill?' So then it all came out; and the long and the short ofthe matter, by all I can learn, seems to be this. Mr. Edward Ferrars, the very young man I used to joke with you about (but however, as itturns out, I am monstrous glad there was never any thing in it), Mr. Edward Ferrars, it seems, has been engaged above this twelvemonth to mycousin Lucy! -- There's for you, my dear! -- And not a creature knowing asyllable of the matter, except Nancy! -- Could you have believed such athing possible? -- There is no great wonder in their liking one another; but that matters should be brought so forward between them, and nobodysuspect it! -- THAT is strange! -- I never happened to see them together, or I am sure I should have found it out directly. Well, and so thiswas kept a great secret, for fear of Mrs. Ferrars, and neither she noryour brother or sister suspected a word of the matter; -- till this verymorning, poor Nancy, who, you know, is a well-meaning creature, but noconjurer, popt it all out. 'Lord!' thinks she to herself, 'they areall so fond of Lucy, to be sure they will make no difficulty about it;'and so, away she went to your sister, who was sitting all alone at hercarpet-work, little suspecting what was to come-for she had just beensaying to your brother, only five minutes before, that she thought tomake a match between Edward and some Lord's daughter or other, I forgetwho. So you may think what a blow it was to all her vanity and pride. She fell into violent hysterics immediately, with such screams asreached your brother's ears, as he was sitting in his own dressing-roomdown stairs, thinking about writing a letter to his steward in thecountry. So up he flew directly, and a terrible scene took place, forLucy was come to them by that time, little dreaming what was going on. Poor soul! I pity HER. And I must say, I think she was used veryhardly; for your sister scolded like any fury, and soon drove her intoa fainting fit. Nancy, she fell upon her knees, and cried bitterly; and your brother, he walked about the room, and said he did not knowwhat to do. Mrs. Dashwood declared they should not stay a minutelonger in the house, and your brother was forced to go down upon HISknees too, to persuade her to let them stay till they had packed uptheir clothes. THEN she fell into hysterics again, and he was sofrightened that he would send for Mr. Donavan, and Mr. Donavan foundthe house in all this uproar. The carriage was at the door ready totake my poor cousins away, and they were just stepping in as he cameoff; poor Lucy in such a condition, he says, she could hardly walk; andNancy, she was almost as bad. I declare, I have no patience with yoursister; and I hope, with all my heart, it will be a match in spite ofher. Lord! what a taking poor Mr. Edward will be in when he hears ofit! To have his love used so scornfully! for they say he is monstrousfond of her, as well he may. I should not wonder, if he was to be inthe greatest passion! -- and Mr. Donavan thinks just the same. He and Ihad a great deal of talk about it; and the best of all is, that he isgone back again to Harley Street, that he may be within call when Mrs. Ferrars is told of it, for she was sent for as soon as ever my cousinsleft the house, for your sister was sure SHE would be in hysterics too; and so she may, for what I care. I have no pity for either of them. Ihave no notion of people's making such a to-do about money andgreatness. There is no reason on earth why Mr. Edward and Lucy shouldnot marry; for I am sure Mrs. Ferrars may afford to do very well by herson, and though Lucy has next to nothing herself, she knows better thanany body how to make the most of every thing; I dare say, if Mrs. Ferrars would only allow him five hundred a-year, she would make asgood an appearance with it as any body else would with eight. Lord! how snug they might live in such another cottage as yours-or a littlebigger-with two maids, and two men; and I believe I could help them toa housemaid, for my Betty has a sister out of place, that would fitthem exactly."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我当时也是这么说的，亲爱的。‘天哪！’我说，‘达什伍德夫人病了？’接着，全都真相大白了。据我了解，事情大概是这样的：爱德华。费拉斯先生，也就是我常常常来取笑你的那位少爷（不过我很高兴，事实证明这些玩笑毫无根据），看来，这位爱德华。费拉斯先生与我表侄女露西订婚已经一年多了。你看，亲爱的，竟有这种事！除了南希，别人居然一点不知道！你能相信会有这种事吗？他们两人相爱，这倒不奇怪。但是事情闹到这个地步，竟然没有引起任何人的猜疑！这也就怪啦！我从来没有看见他们在一起过，不然我肯定马上就能看出苗头。你瞧，他们由于害怕费拉斯太太，就绝对保守秘密。直到今天早晨，一直没有引起他母亲和你哥嫂的丝毫怀疑。到了今天早晨，可怜的南希，你知道她本是个好心人，可就是没长心眼，一股脑儿全给捅出来了。‘天哪！’她自言自语地说，‘她们都这么喜欢露西，将来肯定不会从中刁难啦。’说罢，赶忙跑到你嫂子跟前。你嫂子正独自一个人坐在那儿织地毯，压根儿没想到会出什么事——她五分钟前还在对你哥哥说，她想让爱德华和某某勋爵的女儿配成一对，我忘了是哪位勋爵。因此你可以想象，这对你嫂子的虚荣心和自尊心是多么沉重的打击。她顿时歇斯底里大发作，一个劲地尖声叫喊。你哥哥坐在楼下化妆室里，想给他乡下的管家写封信。听到尖叫声，飞身上楼，随即发生了一个可怕的情景，因为当时露西正好来了，她一点也不知道出了什么事。可怜的人儿！我真可怜她。应该说，我认为她受到了十分无情的对待；因为你嫂子发狂似地破口大骂，露西当即昏厥过去。南希跪在地上，失声痛哭。你哥哥在房里跪来胁去，说他不知道该怎么办。达什伍德夫人宣称，詹宁斯太太说到这里停住了。好在埃丽诺有足够的时间定定心，因而还能合乎情理地做出回答，谈点看法。她高兴地发现，詹宁斯太太并没怀疑她对此事特别感兴趣。而且像她最近常常希望的那样，这位太太不再认为她还眷恋着爱德华。而最使她感到高兴的是，因为玛丽安不在场，她觉得自己完全可以不露窘态地谈论这件事，并且认为，对与这件事有关的每个人的行为，完全可以不抱任何偏见地做出判断。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She could hardly determine what her own expectation of its event reallywas; though she earnestly tried to drive away the notion of its beingpossible to end otherwise at last, than in the marriage of Edward andLucy. What Mrs. Ferrars would say and do, though there could not be adoubt of its nature, she was anxious to hear; and still more anxious toknow how Edward would conduct himself. For HIM she felt muchcompassion; -- for Lucy very little-and it cost her some pains toprocure that little; -- for the rest of the party none at all.</div>

<div class="line_en">Here Mrs. Jennings ceased, and as Elinor had had time enough to collecther thoughts, she was able to give such an answer, and make suchobservations, as the subject might naturally be supposed to produce. Happy to find that she was not suspected of any extraordinary interestin it; that Mrs. Jennings (as she had of late often hoped might be thecase) had ceased to imagine her at all attached to Edward; and happyabove all the rest, in the absence of Marianne, she felt very well ableto speak of the affair without embarrassment, and to give her judgment, as she believed, with impartiality on the conduct of every oneconcerned in it.</div>

<div class="line_en">She was very far from wishing to dwell on her own feelings, or torepresent herself as suffering much, any otherwise than as theself-command she had practised since her first knowledge of Edward'sengagement, might suggest a hint of what was practicable to Marianne. Her narration was clear and simple; and though it could not be givenwithout emotion, it was not accompanied by violent agitation, norimpetuous grief. -- THAT belonged rather to the hearer, for Mariannelistened with horror, and cried excessively. Elinor was to be thecomforter of others in her own distresses, no less than in theirs; andall the comfort that could be given by assurances of her own composureof mind, and a very earnest vindication of Edward from every charge butof imprudence, was readily offered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她绝不想多谈她自己的情感，不想多谈她自己如何痛苦，因为她从第一次获悉爱德华订婚以来所采取的克制态度，可以启迪玛丽安怎么办才比较现实。她说得简单明了，虽说没法做到不动感情，她还是没有过于激动，过于悲伤。真正激动、悲伤的倒是听的人，因为玛丽安惊骇地听着，痛哭不止。埃丽诺倒成了别人的安慰者：妹妹痛苦的时候她要安慰她，她自己痛苦的时候她还得安慰她。她甘愿主动地安慰她，一再保证说她心里很坦然，并且苦口婆心地替爱德华开脱罪责，只承认他有些轻率。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But Marianne for some time would give credit to neither. Edward seemeda second Willoughby; and acknowledging as Elinor did, that she HADloved him most sincerely, could she feel less than herself! As forLucy Steele, she considered her so totally unamiable, so absolutelyincapable of attaching a sensible man, that she could not be persuadedat first to believe, and afterwards to pardon, any former affection ofEdward for her. She would not even admit it to have been natural; andElinor left her to be convinced that it was so, by that which onlycould convince her, a better knowledge of mankind.</div>

It was quite out of the benevolence of her heart, that she had asked these young women to her house; merely because shethought they deserved some attention, were harmless, well-behavedgirls, and would be pleasant companions; for otherwise we both wishedvery much to have invited you and Marianne to be with us, while yourkind friend there, was attending her daughter.

If she suspected ANYprepossession elsewhere, it could not be in THAT quarter. 'THERE, tobe sure,' said she, 'I might have thought myself safe.' She was quitein an agony. We consulted together, however, as to what should bedone, and at last she determined to send for Edward. He came. But Iam sorry to relate what ensued. All that Mrs. Ferrars could say tomake him put an end to the engagement, assisted too as you may wellsuppose by my arguments, and Fanny's entreaties, was of no avail. Duty, affection, every thing was disregarded. I never thought Edwardso stubborn, so unfeeling before. His mother explained to him herliberal designs, in case of his marrying Miss Morton; told him shewould settle on him the Norfolk estate, which, clear of land-tax, brings in a good thousand a-year; offered even, when matters grewdesperate, to make it twelve hundred; and in opposition to this, if hestill persisted in this low connection, represented to him the certainpenury that must attend the match. His own two thousand pounds sheprotested should be his all; she would never see him again; and so farwould she be from affording him the smallest assistance, that if hewere to enter into any profession with a view of better support, shewould do all in her power to prevent him advancing in it."</div>
