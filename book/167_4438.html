<div class="line_en">"Rich," said the big frog-faced man, taking a healthy gulp. He was not a man for sipping, Janos Slynt. Tyrion had made note of that at once. "Yes, rich, that's the very word I was searching for, the very word. You have a gift for words, Lord Tyrion, if I might say so. And you tell a droll tale. Droll, yes."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“馥郁。”青蛙脸的杰诺斯·史林特又猛灌一大口。此人喝酒从不小口浅酌，提利昂一见面就注意到了。“对，馥郁，我要说的就是这个词儿，完完全全就是这个词儿。不是我吹牛，提利昂大人，您对文字还真有一套。您说的故事更是滑稽有趣，对，就是滑稽。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“多恩的，”提利昂作个手势，仆人趋前倒酒。除了几个仆人，小厅里只有他和杰诺斯伯爵。桌上点着蜡烛，四周一片昏暗。“说起来真是难得一寻，多恩酒的味道通常没这么馥郁。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"As you wish." He took another swallow, dribbling wine on the front of his black satin doublet. He was wearing a cloth-of-gold half cape fastened with a miniature spear, its point enameled in dark red. And he was well and truly drunk.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="胆子倒是不小咧“比这更微不足道的芝麻小事，都有人拿来当开战的藉口呢。”说完两人哈哈大笑。“选赫伦堡当根据地，您可真有胆量。那地方既阴森，又庞大…维护起来可得花不少钱哪。更别提有人谣传那里受诅咒了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tyrion covered his mouth and belched politely. Unlike Lord Janos he had gone easy on the wine, but he was very full. The first thing he had done after taking up residence in the Tower of the Hand was inquire after the finest cook in the city and take her into his service. This evening they had supped on oxtail soup, summer greens tossed with pecans, grapes, red fennel, and crumbled cheese, hot crab pie, spiced squash, and quails drowned in butter. Each dish had come with its own wine. Lord Janos allowed that he had never eaten half so well. "No doubt that will change when you take your seat in Harrenhal," Tyrion said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="提利昂伸手捂嘴，轻声打了个嗝。他的酒量远不及杰诺斯伯爵，只是吃得很饱。搬进首相塔后，他头一件事便是寻找城中第一名厨，并将她收进门下。这天他们的晚餐是牛尾汤；核桃、葡萄、赤茴香和碎乳酪拌夏蔬；热腾腾的螃蟹派、香料煮南瓜，还有奶油鹌鹑，每道菜都有相应的美酒搭配。杰诺斯伯爵说他这辈子从没吃过如此美味的一餐。“等您进驻赫伦堡之后，想必这种菜色就是家常便饭了。”提利昂说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Should I fear a pile of stone?" He hooted at the notion. "A bold man, you said. You must be bold, to rise. As I have. To Harrenhal, yes! And why not? You know. You are a bold man too, I sense. Small, mayhap, but bold."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“一堆石头有什么好怕？”他吹声口哨，“你说我有胆量？没错，一个人非得有胆量，才能爬到我今天的地位。赫伦堡有什么不好？好得很咧！依我看，你也是个有胆量的家伙，个子虽然小了点，胆子倒是不小咧！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"To be sure." Tyrion took a small sip of his own wine. "I had been considering Ser Jacelyn Bywater. He's been captain on the Mud Gate for three years, and he served with valor during Balon Greyjoy's Rebellion. King Robert knighted him at Pyke. And yet his name does not appear on your list."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊，”提利昂自饮了一小口。“我倒考虑过杰斯林·拜瓦特爵士，他担任烂泥门守卫队长已经三年，从前在平定巴隆·葛雷乔伊之乱中也表现英勇，劳勃国王亲自在派克城封他为骑士。可惜，他的名字却不在您这张单子上。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Not happily, if he was any judge, but beyond sending an angry protest to Lord Tywin in Harrenhal, he did not see what Cersei could hope to do about it. Tyrion had the City Watch now, plus a hundred-and-a-half fierce clansmen and a growing force of sellswords recruited by Bronn. He would seem well protected.</div>
