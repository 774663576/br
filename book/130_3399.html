<div class="line_en">Yet, valuable as all this was, I felt that I was no closer to the facts of circumcision which, after all, was what I had come to witness. We went through endless rehearsals with the impatience of a peacetime army. Matthieu and I cleaned and checked the equipment. Fungus and the ravages of termites had affected only unimportant parts of the apparatus. We practised loading film. I taught Matthieu to take photographs both with an automatic and a manual camera. He swiftly mastered both.</div>

<div class="line_en">Time had dragged on in Dowayoland. My own metabolic processes seemed to have adapted to a slower pace of life. Outsiders who appeared seemed to flash across the horizon at indecent speed. I rose, ate, drank, excreted, talked. Time passed. Most of the day was spent with a local healer who had accepted me as a pupil. We went out together, discussed illnesses. (How do you know it is this illness? Is this just a sign of another illness or an illness itself?) I became skilled in the art of diagnosis. I learned how to rub slices of zepto together, like the healers, to divine whether the ultimate cause of disease was ancestral displeasure, witchcraft, a violated interdiction, contact with polluted people and so on. I learned herbal remedies. I learned how to bleed a woman suffering from excess of blood owing to exposure to sunlight. My tutor was as sagacious, gentle and rigorous as my tutor at Oxford had been.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="多瓦悠兰的日子慢条斯理。我的新陈代谢似乎也适应了缓慢的生活步调。途经此地的外来者都似仓皇呼啸奔过地平线。我起床、吃饭、喝酒、排泄、说话。时光消逝。当地一位疗者收我为徒，我多数时间与他工作。我们一起出去、一起讨论疾病。（他如何知道病人得的是这种疾病？它是另一种疾病的征兆还是真的这种疾病？）我逐渐熟练诊断疾病的艺术。我也学会像疗者一样搓揉扎布托，来判断疾病的元凶是祖灵不高兴、巫术，还是触犯禁忌、接触了受污染的人。我学会草药疗法，碰到女人在太阳底下曝晒过久、血流过旺，我也懂得如何帮她放血。我的老师十分贤明，和我牛津大学的老师样，温和严厉兼具。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">While we were engaged in such time-filling activities, we seemed to see a lot of the chief's youngest daughter, Irma. She developed the habit of coming and preening herself in the space before our huts. There is nothing particularly unusual in this. The compound, after all, belonged to her father. Dowayo maids are much given to self-beautification. They weave their hair into intricate patterns. They rub their skin with oil and red kaolin until they shine like antique mahogany.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当我们干这些打发时间的事情，祖帝保最小的女儿爱玛不时在我们眼前打转。她养成一种习惯，跑来我们的茅屋前空地搔首弄姿打点仪容。这没什么特别的，毕竟这是她老爸的院落。多瓦悠女人颇爱修饰，把头发绑成复杂花样，用油与高岭土按摩身体，直到像古董桃花心木般闪闪发亮。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After a while, however, she began to adopt what seemed to be consciously languorous poses along the logs that served as seats before her father's house. She sang odd little melodies and showed her profile to full advantage. Matthieu's embarrassment was manifest. It was obvious to all that she had set her sights on him. Of course, she was married already but this did not necessarily count for very much. Dowayos frequently divorce. The introduction of a young, unattached but highly marriageable young man such as Matthieu into the compound was bound to have a certain disruptive effect on social life. I was relieved that the impact seemed to be on Zuuldibo's daughter rather than one of his wives. Thus far, I had heard no murmur of complaint, a sign that everyone must have been on their very best behaviour where there were so many jealous ladies watching each other's every move.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没多久，爱玛开始倚着她父亲门前权充椅子的一根木头，刻意摆出慵懒姿态。嘴里唱些奇特小曲，全力展现美妙体态。马修的尴尬显而易见。因为爱玛显然看上他了。当然，她已经结婚，但这不见得构成障碍。离婚在多瓦悠社会殊属平常。让马修这样一个年轻、没有婚约束缚、堪称高度匹配的男子住进院落，社交生活注定掀起涟漪。让我大松一口气的是马修的魅力只及于祖帝保的女儿，而非他的妻妾。妒火中烧的女人会互相监视，到目前为止，我尚未听到耳语或抱怨，显示祖帝保的妻妾都很安分。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Irma had not been greatly favoured by nature. From her father came her stocky frame, unrelieved by the slightest sign of a waist, and the bullet-like skull that she emphasized by constant shaving of her head. Her real strength in the marriage stakes lay, however, not in her physical charms. Her great attraction lay in the proof she had given of her unusual fertility, having produced two children -- one alas now dead -- in the course of a mere two years of marriage. She was now pregnant again. Should she divorce at this point, the ownership of the child would make a splendid legal wrangle that the Dowayos would digest with relish. She was admittedly a little older than Matthieu but this is no great impediment in a culture where a boy may expect to inherit his father's wives or take over those of a Nestorian uncle. She would be a very good match for him if he could raise the bride-price. I knew with a resigned certainty that his hopes would centre on me as his source of finance. I would be subject to pleas, cajolery and ill-temper until I promised, in a moment of weakness, to help. Looking back over conversations of the past few days, I paranoiacally detected a common theme in Matthieu's discourse. His father's cattle were sick, the millet did not look good this year. I resolved to strike back with a few dropped remarks about my own poverty and lack of cash.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱玛堪称未受上天眷顾。她遗传了父亲的雄壮体格，雪上加霜，点腰身也没，头形像子弹，经常剃得光亮。美貌绝不是她在婚姻的最大本钱，而是无与伦比的生育力，结婚仅两年，她便生了两个孩子（很可惜，其中一个夭折）。此刻，她又有孕在身，如果离婚，腹中孩儿谁属铁定会引起天翻地覆的法律争议，让多瓦悠人津津嚼舌。爱玛比马修略大一点，这也不构成问题。多瓦悠文化里，父亲或年耄的叔辈过世，小辈必须继承他们的妻妾呢。如果马修有本事筹措聘金，爱玛堪称良配。无可奈何的宿命感油然而生，我知道马修一定会将我当作财库。他会苦苦哀求、甜言诱骗、使性子发脾气，直到我突然一阵心软，答应帮他为止。回首过去几天的对话，我惊觉它们全围绕同一主题——他父亲的牛生病了、今年的小米收成不太好。我决心反击，偶尔也冒出几句自己手头拮据、欠缺现金的话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Over the next few days, Irma decided to up the pressure herself. We were always playing about with cameras, surely we would wish to photograph her? Would we prefer a picture with her child (we knew of course that she had already had two children) or without? It was a pity that she had had no chance to decorate herself, she indicated her ample form with an elegant gesture, but perhaps we would be content with her everyday appearance? In a fit of gratuitous wickedness, I suggested that Matthieu should take some practice shots of Irma.</div>

<div class="line_en">One particularly invidious technique used by Matthieu in the past, to bring pressure to bear, was to place relatives at strategic points in public places. They could then leap out upon me, embracing my knees and crying out my generosity to the world. Tears of gratitude would spring spontaneously to their eyes as they contrasted my wealth with their poverty, my open-handed beneficence with the hard-heartedness of those demanding bride-price. They would wail and shout, thanking me for things I had never agreed to do, until in the public mind, I would be guilty of the worst perfidy were I to refuse.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="以前，马修最惹人厌的施加压力法是找来亲戚，占据公众场合的战略位置。看到我，便扑上前来，抱住我的膝盖、大声赞美我是世上最慷慨的人。讲起他们的贫蹇与我的富裕，眼睛顿时涌现感激的泪光，盛赞我的慷慨好施，那些死要聘金的人又是多么硬心肠他们会啜泣、高喊，满口子感谢我从未答应过的事。直到众人认为我如拒绝便是严重背信不忠。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Thus it was only after a lengthy stay in our company that Irma retreated to the guest hut where she and her husband were lodged. Zuuldibo had honoured them greatly by putting them next to the beer hut, a position of great trust. Immediately, we heard raised voices, the slap of a husbandly hand and the head of Zuuldibo's son-in-law rose over the low mud wall to glare at us. That he should do this in her father's village showed that things were heading for a crisis. I decided we needed an expedition to remove us from the village until things had settled down.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱玛与我们搞了许久，才返回她与先生的客居茅屋。祖帝保让他们住在啤酒茅屋旁，这是极大荣耀，代表对他们极为信任。没多久，我们便听到屋内声浪升高，爱玛的丈夫揍了她，从低矮的泥墙探出头来狠狠瞪视我们。他居然敢在老婆的娘家村子揍人，显示事情已演化成危机。我决定马修与我必须赶快远行，直到风暴过了为止。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was at this point that Gaston arrived on his bicycle. There was a man in town, a black-white man, who claimed to know me and was looking for me. Gaston had sent him to the mission and ridden back to warn me in case I wanted to avoid him. This Dowayo view of the world as full of people who had to be avoided, as rich in opportunities not to see people, was one that always appealed to me.</div>

<div class="line_en">Bob and I had met purely by chance some time before. I was driving into the city for supplies when I came across a strange sight. There, standing by the roadside, was a man hitch-hiking. In itself, there is nothing very unusual about this. People in Africa hitch-hike all the time. Whole families do it together, often with most of the family possessions and livestock on their heads. The approved method, however, is to stand by the roadside waving the whole lower arm in a curiously limp-wristed, flapping motion. The lift, if offered, is not normally a gratuitous benefaction for payment is expected. This constitutes an important supplement to the salaries of lorry drivers, for example. No vehicle is ever considered unsuitable for the large-scale transport of people and chattels. Petrol-tankers, for example, are held to be ideal for this purpose and are regularly to be seen thundering along with rather wide-eyed passengers clinging to their rounded tops.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="巴布与我认识纯属机缘巧合。当时我开车进城采买日用品，看到奇怪景象。路边站着一个男人拦便车。拦便车本身一点不稀奇非洲人一天到晚搭便车。常常全家拦便车，带着所有家当，头上还顶着家禽。大家认可的拦便车方式是站在路旁，下手臂儿好似瘫痪般轻轻甩动。如果有人让你搭便车，那绝非免费的善举，你必须付钱这是货车司机重要的外快来源。任何车种都可塞进大批便车客与他们的“动产”。油罐车最适合此种用途，常自路上轰然驶过，眼珠子惊吓得老大的便车客死命抓着圆圆的油罐顶。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The present figure was unusual in that he was hitching after the Western fashion, jerking an extended thumb into the air at approaching vehicles. This was unfortunate. In Africa, interpretations of this gesture may vary but all agree that it is extremely rude. Such a gesture, executed in the face of a huge African trucker, may readily lead to rage and violence. Should any female member of his family, such as his mother or sister, be in the cab of a truck so addressed, the consequences are likely to be extreme.</div>

<div class="line_en">The hiker seemed innocent of slanderous intent. An expression of puzzled disappointment was stamped across his features. Occasionally a truck would swerve dangerously towards him, sometimes a face, distorted with anger, would appear briefly through a cab window and mouth silent words of rage at him. None stopped. I did.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="便车客显然对自己的“侮辱意图”一无所觉。脸上挂满迷惑的失望之情。偶尔一辆卡车惊险冲向他来；有时，一张愤怒扭曲的脸孔从计程车窗探出，张嘴发出愤怒唇语。没人停车载他，我停了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My passenger, assuming I was French, conversed with me for some time in that tongue. Having ascertained that I spoke English as well, he switched to that language, albeit with a strong American accent. It was still not obvious that he was not of wholly African origins. Often, the gilded youth of Africa will model its English on the heroes of the no-longer-silent screen and attain John Wayne drawls or accents rich in the lore of the plantation, without ever having visited the USA.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was only after some miles that he grudgingly confessed to being a black American or as he put it 'an African of American origin'. It seemed that his truck had broken down some miles to the east of where I picked him up. What was he doing here? Was he perhaps with the Peace Corps? Bob's expression betrayed a certain lack of admiration for the Corps and its values. He was an anthropologist. His research centred on market-traders in the cities. He was seeking to determine what factors affected the type and price of goods in the market-place and the subtler cultural aspects of its economic operations. Since he had been so reticent about his own origins, I was silent about mine and encouraged him to give me a lecture on the nature of the anthropological endeavour. I no longer recall exactly what he said except that he seemed to reserve a special sort of scorn for anthropologists who concerned themselves with religion or ritual as I did. They were, it seemed, inherently frivolous and evil, diverting attention, as they did, from the realities of economic exploitation.</div>

<div class="line_en">His house was modern but modest, of square mud bricks covered with a skim of cement. A small garden lay at the back together with a separate cooking hut. Africans are appalled at European preparedness to cook and sleep under the same roof. He had furniture, I noted with envy, including such luxury features as a bed and chairs of angle-iron. Curiously, although of immense strength, these were, as always in Cameroon, broken. The present specimens were lacking occasional legs and arms as if veterans of some withering campaign. The most wanton self-indulgence was a low coffee-table on which we set our beers. To make up for such fripperies, we drank man-to-man from the bottle. From the temperature of the beer, he had a refrigerator too.</div>

<div class="line_en">Bob and I got to know each other quite well in the course of the next few months. Lonely Westerners tend to seek each other out in the same restricted selection of locales. It was almost two months before he ever asked me what I was doing in Cameroon, no doubt assuming that I was involved in one of the many development projects, and providing me with a sort of cameo of the anthropologist in his natural setting. When he did find out, it inevitably became a joke between us, he constantly threatening to visit me in the field.</div>

<div class="line_en">Bob was a man of unquiet mind. Most of his problems came from being black and his attempts to adopt a sensible, sensitive and self-aware stance to his colour and its implications. He had done something called 'Black Studies' in an Eastern college for he held the view that it was vital for coloured Americans to have an alternative cultural tradition that would assign them a higher place than did the white one. He never celebrated Christmas but an obscure festival of Swahili origin. He had been mortified to discover that Africans had never heard of it. He had learned Swahili and imposed it on his wife and children for one day a week in the house. Having never been informed otherwise and having assumed that Africa was in some sense a unity, he had been genuinely astonished that no one in Cameroon could speak it or had even heard of the language.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="巴布是个心灵极端不平静的人。他的多数困扰来自身为黑人，以及他企图为自己的肤色及其意涵寻找一个合理、敏感、自我意识强烈的立场。他曾在东部某学院修习所谓的“黑人研究”，他认为美裔黑人有必要寻找另类文化传统，让自已置于一个高于白人文化传统赋予他们的位置。譬如他从来不庆祝圣诞节，而是过一个源自斯瓦希里（Swail）（1）的不知名节庆。当他发现非洲人从未听过这个节日，简直为之心碎。他学习斯瓦希里语，勒令老婆与小孩在家里每星期必须有一天说斯瓦希里语。他对非洲并不了解，以为整个非洲是个单一个体，到了此地后，赫然发现喀麦隆人都不会说斯瓦希里语，甚至听都没听过，真是大吃一惊。【注：（1）斯瓦希里是班图人的一支，居住于桑给巴尔及其邻近的非洲海岸。斯瓦希里语是东非洲最重要的通用语言，使用范围快速拓展到中非洲与南非洲。详见David Munro， Oxford Dictionary of the World， London：Oxford University press（1996），第577页。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The first crisis had come after a mere few weeks. His small daughter had fallen ill. There is nothing like illness for cutting through the layers of pretension that all people use to insulate their self-respect. All Bob's African friends spoke of powerful purgative draughts and copious bleeding of the child with cupping horns. Bob wanted an American doctor, someone with sterile equipment and a reassuring white coat. In this, his wife had been in full agreement, firmly refusing the ministrations of local healers in the knowledge that they could worry about the implications of this for their avowed 'Africanness' later. Bob, however, had insisted that his child should stay with her family in the hot, noisy, dirty township, without plumbing. Bob's wife had insisted on moving to a hotel until the child recovered. Harsh words, impossible to call back, had been spoken. Life had become a strained truce.</div>

<div class="line_en">All this, he confessed, had been in his green and naive days. Since arrival in Africa, he had settled down to learning Fulani, a language that came only with difficulty, and picked an unexciting but doubtless valuable research topic that he had worked on with a passion. In order to establish his bona fides with the local people, he insisted on living in one of the non-patrician areas of the town, in a hut without running water. It sometimes seemed that the absence of plumbing was his ultimate anthropological credential.

<div class="line_en">An unhealable breach had developed when it was discovered that Bob, in accordance with local norms of friendship, had allowed the wives of neighbours to breast-feed the smallest child when she became fractious. His wife had been horrified at the thought of unwashed breasts being popped promiscuously into the mouth of her sanitized offspring. The child was sent home to live with her grandmother in the United States, 'for health reasons'.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着发生无可弥补的裂缝。巴布的妻子发现他遵循当地友谊的习俗，当他们最小的孩子发脾气吵闹时，居然让邻人的老婆们掏出奶来喂她。巴布的老婆一想到那些没洗过的乳房都可胡乱塞进她女儿干净的嘴里，就为之抓狂。马上以“健康理由”将女儿送回美国跟外祖母住。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Matters had finally come to a head over the issue of the schooling of the children. Bob, only too aware of the potentially divisive effect of segregation in education, had been unshakeable in his resolve to send the children to the local school. His wife failed to appreciate that the abysmally low scholastic levels her children encountered there were to be regarded as part of the rich and colourful local life. Since she and Bob had suffered from bad schooling in childhood and had had to make Herculean efforts to work their way through college, he could see her point of view and had offered only a half-hearted resistance. Reasonableness had led inexorably to defeat. The other children had followed the first, 'to be with their sister'. Bob's ideological bedrock had now begun to crumble. Worse was yet to follow -- the defection of his wife.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小孩的教育问题则让他们陷入真正危机。巴布太了解“隔离教育”可能带来的分裂影响，坚持孩子要上当地的学校。他的妻子则不认为此地恐怖低落的学校水准是什么值得欣赏的“丰富、多采”生活。因为她与巴布小时都吃过这种苦，使尽力气才上了大学。巴布理解老婆的想法，因此半推半就。势不可免，开始讲道理后便导致全面溃败。其他孩子也跟着妹妹回美国，理由是“和妹妹作伴”。巴布的意识形态坚石开始崩裂。慘事接踵而至，他的老婆也叛变了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The next eruption had come over the issue of whether or not the children should be allowed to swim in the bilharzia-infested river, as did the children of the locals. A neat compromise had been found. Bob had been forced to spend two weeks away from his research trying to convince his neighbours to forbid their children from going near the river. He did not succeed entirely, but made enough converts to justify his own stance. Thus he fitted in with normality by changing normality.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二次争端主他们的孩子该不该像当地孩子一样，在满布住血吸虫的河里游泳。他们找到简单妥协方案。巴布被迫丢下研究两周，说服邻居不要让孩子去那条河游泳。他不算完全成功，但的确说服了一些人，足以合理化自己的立场。此举正是改变常态，以俾自己可以融入“常态”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Bob's parents having been at one time heavily engaged in domestic service, he stoutly refused all offers from washermen, gardeners, house-repairers, drivers and the like since, in his eagerness to throw off the shackles of an outmoded servitude, he was loth to impose on his fellows the indignity of menial tasks. This, again, was taken very ill by his neighbours, vitiating all his attempts at good relations. In Africa it is often the duty of the rich to supply employment for the poor -- this was exactly how it was explained to Bob's wife. Locals refused to comprehend Bob's unwillingness to help them. The only reason could be his notorious meanness. In cultures where the pagan virtues are preached if not always practised, meanness is held to be a far worse sin than in our own culture. Where the whole fabric of social life is held together by the largely unenforceable claims of reciprocal gifts and obligations, the world is threatened by a stingy man. It was this that -- added to the tedium of social life, the impossibility of finding what she considered to be food fit to eat, the general ill-will of other women who were scandalized at behaviour in her they would have accepted in a white American -- drove her to leave 'to be with her children'.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="巴布的父母一度得辛苦操持家务，因为他拒绝聘用洗衣工、园丁、修理工……他急于拋弃过时的仆佣苦役，痛恨让同胞操持无尊严的卑贱杂役。巴布的作法让邻人很不谅解，破坏了他想要维持好关系的企图。在非洲，富人有义务聘雇穷人，他们也是如此告诉巴布的老婆。当地人拒绝体会巴布“拒施援手”的苦衷。唯一理由铁定是他小气到家。在一个歌颂异教美德（虽然他们未必身体力行）的国度，吝啬是一种大罪，比它在西方社会的罪恶程度要严重得多。当一个社会的生活肌理大部分由非强制性的相互馈赠与义务所支撑时，小气鬼是这个世界的一大威胁。基于上述理由，加上生活枯燥乏味、找不到能下咽的食物，再加上本地女人对她十分恶劣，总是诋毀她的一举一动（如果她是白种美国人，这些举止便不构成问题巴布的老婆也决定回去“跟孩子一起”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Though by nature good-hearted and generous, she was slowly worn down by life in the township. The worst thing was that all the neighbours insisted on treating her and her husband as American first and black second. There was no reciprocity to effusions of soul brotherhood. Bob's determination to live in an inconvenient, cramped hut was greeted with bewilderment. One man, in his cups, had upbraided Bob in the street. What sort of a man was he to live in squalor when it was known all Americans were rich? His wife and family were ill-served by such meanness. He had even quoted proverbs at a defenceless Bob.</div>

<div class="line_en">The straw that broke the camel's back was Bob's work on markets. The local Fulani merchants rigged the local market with such a tightly enforced monopoly that all newcomers and non-Fulani were excluded. They, moreover, assigned to themselves profits of such proportions that Bob was appalled. Having experienced all his life the hard school of deprivation under white domination, he found it difficult to cope with the notion that black Africans could oppress black Africans with equal fervour and complacency. Ultimately he was to break off his studies and return to America. Curiously, his dedication to Black Studies was in no way diminished. When last heard of he was setting up a major programme on African literature.</div>

<div class="line_en">Bob turned up at the village some time later -- Matthieu and I having abandoned all hope of getting away from Irma who had posted herself, still simpering, across the compound. He explained that he had been on his way to one of the southern cities 'for some comparative work' and had decided to look me up for a few hours. Matthieu and I took him on a guided tour. We visited the chief, the skulls of the dead, finally the men's washing-place, a haven set among trees where men bathed in the gushing cold water and lay around on the sunny ledges to relax and talk. Bob was entranced. He had never really visited an isolated village before, spending all his time in cities and those villages by the main highway which supplied produce for the city markets.</div>

<div class="line_en">Bob contemplated it all with love. Most of all he loved Irma. She seemed to have taken to him with fierce devotion, adopting a semi-swooned position at his feet as we sat down outside my hut. Communication between them was difficult, Matthieu acting as interpreter -- and interpreting with great freedom. She gave him a present of a little bundle of red peppers. He gave her some chewing-gum and a photograph of himself, suitably inscribed. I thought inevitably of Black Héloïse. Would that grinning image turn up in fifty years' time at the bottom of an old woman's trunk? Bob was ebullient. Irma, he revealed, was fresh and natural, the true Africa. It was cities that were bad and cities -- as everyone knew -- were a foreign importation. All that was bad, he saw now, came from the oppressive forces of the West. But there were still pockets of indigenous wisdom. He warmed to his theme, contrasting the harsh deprivations of his own city life with my own good fortune in living with these truly wonderful human beings. Matthieu rapidly gave up translating all this, explained to him in Bob's halting French interspersed with rhapsodic outbursts in English. 'He said the village looks rich,' he would explain to a frantic Irma, or, 'He said the city is expensive.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="巴布充满爱意沉思默察眼前一切。他尤其喜爱爱玛。她对巴布更是热情关爱，当我们坐在我的茅屋前，爱玛几乎是半昏倒似的卧在他的脚旁。他们的对话极为困难，马修权当翻译，翻译态度至为自由。爱玛致赠巴布一串红椒。他给她几片口香糖还有一幅镶得不错的照片，令我想起“黑皮肤的爱拉薇姿”。五十年后，这幅露齿微笑的照片会珍藏在某个老妇的箱子底吗？巴布爱意洋溢，他说，爱玛既清新又自然，这才是真正的非洲。非洲坏的是城市，而众所周知，城市是西方移植品。现在他明白了，所有不好的东西都是来自西方的压制力量。但非洲仍蕴藏原住民智惹宝藏。他对这个话题越来越热衷，拿自己饱受残酷剥夺的城市生活与我和善良人们共居的好运相比较。巴布向马修解释上述话，不流利的法语夹着狂乱脱口的英语，马修随即放弃翻译此段话，他对狂喜的爱玛说：“他说村落看起来很富有，都市生活很贵。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dowayoland conspired with him to fit into some idyll of rural peace and fulfilment. The village basked in benevolent warmth. Chickens did not screech, they cooed. Children existed solely as a source of pure and innocent laughter that trickled, like music, to our ears. Cattle lowed in hushed tones that exuded fat contentment. No youths strutted with blaring transistors to remind of a larger, harsher world. Matthieu's own radio lay silent in the red, glossy cosy he had sewn for it. Gone were the human figures toiling for hour after hour, bent double in the broiling sun. They could be glimpsed like delicate sculptures, recumbent in the field-shelters. Their elegance of gesture, the sweet mumble of their voices, suggested poetry rather than a wrangle over the ownership of cattle. The fields themselves looked suave and complete as if simply there without human effort. A sumptuous peace reigned as far as the eye could see, in some vast cosmic act of imposture.</div>
