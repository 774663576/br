<div class="line_en">Tristan thought of the assurances he'd once given her -- that he would never lose her, that he would never let the wraiths get her. He'd been absolutely confident; now he wasn't so sure. Thanks to Dylan, the game had changed, he'd changed, and he didn't know all the rules of this new engagement. He was beginning to have an inkling, though, and that did nothing to allay his doubts.</div>

<div class="line_en">They were determined to make her pay for her arrogance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="它们决心一定要让她为这种傲慢自大付出代价。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tristan knew Dylan was tired. He could hear it in her heavy tread, her laboured breathing; he could feel it in her lagging arm, tugging back on him with every stride. He knew it, and he felt bad, but if they were caught on this hill when the shadows descended, the wraiths would offer no quarter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="崔斯坦知道迪伦很累。他从她沉重的脚步和艰难的呼吸中听出了她的疲惫。从她摆动迟缓的双臂与每走一步都要拉他一下的动作中能感受到她的疲惫。他很清楚这一点，他自己心里也不好受。但如果夜色降临时他们被困在了山上，那些恶魔们绝不会心慈手软。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan almost seemed to have lost her fear of them -- or perhaps it was just that she thought he could protect her from their hunger -- but she was a fool to flirt with danger. She couldn't sense it, he realised, but the wraiths were furious. Not only had they failed to take her on the way across the wasteland, but she'd come back. She'd come back and she'd beaten them. Alone. Without a ferryman to stand between her and their grappling claws.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦似乎已经彻底不害怕它们了—也许是因为她觉得崔斯坦能保护她免遭这群恶魔的毒手—但她这是拿生命开玩笑。恶魔们现在恼羞成怒，她体会不到这一点，但他心里清楚。这种恼怒不仅是因为它们始终没有在她穿过荒原时捉住她，更是因为她竟然掉头回来了。她回来后一次次挫败了它们，而且还是孤身一人，在没有摆渡人保护的情况下完成的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Cresting the top of the hill, he paused for the briefest moment, letting Dylan catch up, catch a breath. This wasn't the highest peak they'd scale if Dylan got her way and they ventured all the way back to the train, but it was tall enough for Tristan to take in the sweeping landscape, undulating for miles and miles in every direction.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="登顶后他略停了一会儿，好让迪伦赶上来喘口气。如果迪伦真的能得偿所愿，如果他们真的能冒险长途跋涉回到那辆列车上，那么在他们要翻越的所有山峰中，这座山算不得是最高的，但它的高度足够让崔斯坦将这四面八方绵延的山路一览无遗。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Rolling towards him, down sloping gradients and up winding vales, were the pulsing hearts of other ferrymen, urging their souls on to safety, just as he was. It was odd; he didn't usually notice them. But now he felt like a pebble in the ocean, pushing against the tide. His every instinct told him to turn, to join their pilgrimage back towards the wasteland line, but he fought against it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其余的摆渡人正带着闪烁的光芒朝他缓缓走来，他们走下倾斜的山坡，走上蜿蜒的溪谷，就像他以前那样，催促着他们保护的灵魂们赶往安全的地方。很奇怪，他以前不常注意他们，现在却感觉自己像一块海中的石子在阻挡潮水一样。他的所有直觉都告诉他掉头回去，加入他们奔赴荒原边界的旅程，但他心里在努力压抑着这个念头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">With night approaching, that way was death for Dylan.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="夜幕正在降临，他要是那样做，迪伦的死期就要到了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Of course she did, she'd been here before. Tristan smiled grimly to himself, then pushed on, his feet finding a safe route down the gravelled hillside.</div>

<div class="line_en">Despite Tristan's misgivings, they made good time slithering down the final peak and he was able to close the door on the frustrated howls of the wraiths before the day grew late enough for them to appear to Dylan. He sighed with relief, leaning his head against the warped wooden entryway for a moment, before moving to light a fire. Dylan stood by the window, staring out. She didn't move, not even when he came up behind her, fire started, and wrapped his arms around her waist.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管崔斯坦顾虑重重，他们还是一溜烟地连走带跑下了山，在夜幕来临、恶魔包围迪伦之前就进了屋，把恶魔们沮丧的叫声关在门外。他如释重负地长吁一声，把头靠在已经弯曲变形的木门处歇了一会儿，然后才起身点火。迪伦站在窗边向外张望。火点着了，他走到她身后，搂住她的腰，可她还是一动也不动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Nothing," she said softly, frowning. "But that's not right, is it? They must be there. Can you see them?"</div>

He sighed, then pulled her closer, resting his temple against hers. Concentrating on the window, he forced his mind to strip back the grassy veneer, revealing the hell below. Dylan gasped quietly and he knew it had worked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个请求貌似没什么危害，但崔斯坦看到她额头紧皱还噘着嘴的奇怪样子，心里还是有些惶恐。他叹息一声，把她往自己身边又拉近了一些，两人的太阳穴紧挨在一起。他集中精力盯着窗子，在头脑中清除了荒原的外表幻象，露出下面真实的地狱。迪伦静静地喘息着，他知道自己的办法起作用了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tristan stared at her for a moment, then looked to the window, eyes scanning the countryside beyond.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="崔斯坦注视了她一会儿，然后又面朝着窗子，眼睛扫过远方的旷野。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"How many souls are still out there?" she asked, turning to face him, her eyes flickering, reflecting the light from the fire.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“现在还有多少灵魂仍然在外面？”她转头面对着他问。炉火的光在她的眸子里闪烁摇曳。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Her gaze went back to the window. One hand reached up and slowly pressed against the pane. Hissing erupted from outside, and Tristan was tempted to pull her arm away. He didn't want the wraiths to think she was taunting them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的目光又转回窗子，伸出一只手扶在窗棂上。外面又突然响起了呼啸声，崔斯坦忍不住想把她的胳膊从窗边移开，他不想让恶魔们觉得她是在奚落、挑衅它们。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They had only been in the safe house a few minutes, not even long enough for the fire to properly catch, but in that time afternoon had melted into evening and light had leached into darkness. There were only three souls still visible, and they were bobbing and weaving furiously as their ferrymen tried to exhort them along the final stretch. Tristan's mouth tightened into a grimace; they weren't all going to make it.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“发生了什么事？”她大声问道，用手使劲敲着窗子，把崔斯坦吓了一跳。窗子被她这一敲颤了颤，但还算牢固，“让我看，崔斯坦！我想知道发生了什么。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, Dylan." He folded his arms across his chest, resolute. It was bad enough that he could see it. He wouldn't make Dylan witness the horror.

<div class="line_en">She didn't know where she was going, where the struggling soul was, so she settled for plummeting straight out in a direct path away from the safe house. Heavy footsteps thumped behind her as Tristan gave chase. She could still hear him calling her name, his voice a mixture of panic and anger. A millisecond later, though, every sound was blocked out as her ears were filled with growling and hissing. The air around her was thick with movement and Dylan felt as if she'd been submerged in icy water. Goosebumps erupted down her arms. She kept running, though. If the wraiths were on her, it meant it was working.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她也不知道自己要往哪儿去，那个正在苦苦挣扎的灵魂又身在何方，所以她只好摸索着顺着小屋的正前方走去。身后响起沉重的脚步声，是崔斯坦追了出来。她听到他在喊自己的名字，声音里既有惊恐也有愤怒。然而瞬间过后，她的耳边就充盈着吼叫声和嘶嘶声，淹没了其他一切声音。周围的空气在剧烈地波动，迪伦感觉自己犹如沉入了冰水中一样，胳膊上马上冒出很多鸡皮疙瘩。然而她还在飞跑，如果恶魔们把注意力放在她身上，这就说明她的策略起作用了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Dylan!" Tristan hauled at her and he was much too strong. He forced her back a step at a time as she continued to struggle against him. "Dylan, stop it!"</div>

<div class="line_en">Out of the blue, something grabbed her, held her in a pincer, but this grip was much more substantial than anything she'd ever felt from the wraiths. It was warm, too. Dylan realised what it was a second before she heard Tristan yelling furiously in her ear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然间，不知什么东西像钳子一样紧紧抓住了她，比她之前经历的魔鬼们的拉拽更加有力，但同时又很温暖。迪伦马上意识到了是谁在拽自己，旋即就听到了崔斯坦愤怒的咆哮声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was hard to distinguish what was coming from the wraiths and what was Tristan, but Dylan felt as if she was being attacked from all sides. Her face stung, her hair was being pulled until tiny clumps ripped their way free of her scalp, and she couldn't breathe as Tristan's arms were painfully tight around her middle. She stumbled, one foot catching on Tristan's leg as he fought with her, and felt her weight dropping down to the ground. The wraiths cackled in delight and for the first time Dylan realised what she was doing; what she was risking.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="恶魔们的声音和崔斯坦的声音纠缠在一起，很难分清。迪伦只感觉自己受到了来自四面八方的攻击。她的脸在刺痛，有一小缕头发已经被拽下了头皮。崔斯坦的胳膊死死抱着她的腰，让她简直无法呼吸。她踉踉跄跄，一只脚在和崔斯坦的拉扯中绊住了他的腿，她感觉身体正在向地面倾倒。恶魔们得意地发出刺耳的笑声，这时的迪伦才意识到自己真的是在冒险。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tristan gaped at her. "Is that what you were doing? Sacrificing yourself for a complete stranger?" His voice rose in pitch and volume. "Dylan!" Words seemed to fail him and he lapsed into silence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="崔斯坦目瞪口呆地看着她，“你刚才就是为了这个？为了一个素不相识的人牺牲自己？”他的声音一下子变大了，声调也高了不少，“迪伦！”他一时竟说不出话来，陷入了沉默。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“什么？”他转过头对着她怒目而视。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For the second time, Tristan slammed the door closed. He leaned back against its weight, gasping, trying to quell the panic that was sending his pulse out of control. Dylan had stumbled to the middle of the room and he could feel her eyes on him. He kept his gaze straight ahead, though, trying to rein in his anger.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="崔斯坦再次砰的一声关上屋门。他背靠在门上，大口喘着气，尽力压抑着让脉搏狂跳不止的恐惧感。迪伦跌跌撞撞地走到屋子中间，崔斯坦能感觉得到她正在看着自己，但他继续正视前方，使劲压着心头怒火。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A timid smile crossed Dylan's lips. The gesture only aggravated Tristan further. Their survival would be justification to her; proof that she had done the right thing. He gritted his teeth.</div>
