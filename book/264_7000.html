<div class="line_en">At last the shooting came to an end. Of course Robin had won the prize. The people cheered loudly when he went up to the Sheriff's wife, who presented him with the arrow. She made a pretty little speech to him, and he thanked her politely, as he always did.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，射箭结束了。当然，罗宾汉获了奖。当他走向郡长夫人跟前，夫人发给他那只箭的时候，人们大声喝彩。夫人简短地跟他讲了几句话，他跟平常一样，彬彬有礼地向她道谢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then everyone went home again. Robin and his men went back as they had come, by twos and threes, and by different roads, so no one suspected who they were.</div>

<div class="line_en">When Robin and his men were all met again under the Green Wood Tree, they had a merry time. There was a grand supper waiting for them. Such laughing and talking there was; they had so many adventures to tell, such jokes to tell. The beautiful silver arrow was passed round, and everyone admired it very much.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Very good advice," replied Robin; "but how are we going to send it? Our messenger could not get out of the town before the Sheriff had read the letter. He would certainly send after him to seize him and shut him up in prison. I cannot allow any of my men to put himself in danger."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“非常好的建议，”罗宾回答，“但是我们怎么送到呢？我们送信的人在郡长读到信之前没法出城。他肯定会派人追他，好抓住他，把他关进监狱去。我不能允许我的伙计去冒险。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I advise you then," said Little John, "to write a letter to the Sheriff. Tell him that we were all there, and that you were the man in red who carried off the prize. Then when you have written the letter, send it to Nottingham."</div>

<div class="line_en">In those days, you see, there were no posts, or postmen. If you wanted to send a letter to anyone, you had to pay a special messenger to carry it for you. It cost a great deal, so people hardly ever wrote letters at all. Indeed, very many people could neither read nor write them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="你明白，在那些日子里，既没有邮局，也没有邮递员。如果你想给任何人写信，都不得不花钱雇一个专门的信使给你送信。那样要花许多钱，因此人们几乎根本不写信。实际上，有很多人既不会读信，也不会写信。">查看中文翻译</div>
