<div class="line_en">Finally, we were ready and Harris said,'We need a good breakfast inside us today. 'While we were eating, George got the newspaper and read us interesting pieces from it -- pieces about people who had been killed on the river, and interesting reports about the weather. The weather report for that day said,'Rain, cold, wet to fine, some thunder, and an east wind'. But weather reports make me angry anyway. They always tell you what the weather was like yesterday, or the day before. It is never tooday's weather. It is always wrong. I remember that one autumn I went on holiday…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="终于一切都安顿好了。哈里斯说：“今天早餐咱们要好好吃一顿才会有劲。”一边吃着饭，乔治一边拿出报纸给大家念些有趣的新闻——有人在河里淹死了；还有天气预报，预报说：“有雨，寒冷，由阴湿转晴，有雷，风向偏东。”天气预报总是让我十分恼火，他们告诉你的天气和昨天的一样、和前天的一样，就是和今天的情况不一样，总是错误的消息。我还记得一年秋天，我去度假……">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then we began to get ready, and we remembered that we had packed the toothbrushes. So we had to go downstairs to get them out of the suitcase.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着我们洗漱，准备停当，这才想起来牙刷已经都装起来了。大家下楼又从箱子里翻出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then we remembered. We looked at George. He was still asleep. Now, it makes me very angry when I see another man asleep and I am awake. We decided to wake George. We ran across the room, and we pulled the bedclothes off him. Harris hit him with a shoe, and I shouted in his ear. He woke up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说到这儿我们才明白过来，看看乔治，他还在睡觉呢！看到别人还在酣睡，我却起了床，我立刻怒火中烧。我们决定把乔治弄醒。我俩“噌”地蹿过去，一下子把被单拽了下来，哈里斯用鞋打他，我对着他的耳朵大喊，他才悠悠醒转过来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'Get up, you fat, lazy thing!'Harris shouted. 'It's a quarter to ten!'</div>

<div class="line_en">The next morning, we read that it was going to be sunny and very hot. So we dressed in light clothes, and we went out. Half an hour later, it began to rain hard, and a very cold wind blew up. And this went on all day. We came home with colds, and we went to bed…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天早晨，报上讲会是个很热的大晴天。我们穿得轻飘飘地出了门。刚过了半个小时，大雨倾盆，加上阵阵的刺骨寒风，整天没有停。回到家里我们都伤风了，赶紧上床睡觉……">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The rain never came.</div>

<div class="line_en">But on the morning of our holiday it was bright and sunny, and George could not make us unhappy. So he went to work.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但我们度假的那天早晨，天气晴朗，阳光普照，乔治也没法烦我们了，所以他上班去了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harris and I finished the rest of the breakfast. Then we carried all our luggage into the road. We tried to get a taxi. Usually taxis come along every three minutes. In fact, there are usually too many taxis. However, that morning we waited twenty minutes for a taxi. A crowd of interested people collected to watch us. I think it was because we had so much luggage. There was a big suitcase, a small bag, two baskets, several blankets, some fruit in a brown paper bag, some pans, some umbrellas and four or five coats and raincoats. After a very long time, a taxi arrived and stopped for us. We packed our things into it, kicked two of Montmorency's friends out of the taxi, and started on our holiday The crowd of peopel waved goodbye to us.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈里斯和我吃完早餐，把所有的行李搬到路上，我们想等辆马车。通常三分钟就会来一辆。马车很多，可那天早晨我们等了足足二十分钟也不见一辆。一群人围过来，兴致勃勃地看着我们俩，我想是因为行李太多的缘故：一个大箱子，一个小包，两个篮子，几张毯子，几只锅，几把伞，四、五件外套和雨衣，牛皮袋里有些水果。过了好长时间，才来了一辆马车。我们把东西放到车上，把“元帅”的两个朋友轰出车外，便开始了我们的旅行，一大群人向我们挥手道别。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On that holiday, the weather reports in the newspaper were always wrong. on Monday it said,'Heavy rain, with thunder'. So we did not go out that day. All day people passed our house. They were all going out, happy and smiling. The sun was shining and there were no clouds in the sky.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那一次度假，报纸上天气预报总是不准。星期一预报说：“预计今日大雨，并伴有雷电。”因此我们没有出去。整整一天，眼看着大家都出了门，兴高采烈地笑着，天上阳光灿烂，万里无云。">查看中文翻译</div>
