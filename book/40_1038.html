<div class="line_en">Laila put on her shoes and quickly brushed her shoulder-length, blond curls in the mirror. Mammy always told Laila that she had inherited her hair color -- as well as her thick-lashed, turquoise green eyes, her dimpled cheeks, her high cheekbones, and the pout of her lower lip, which Mammy shared -- from her great-grandmother, Mammy's grandmother. She was a pari, a stunner, Mammy said. Her beauty was the talk of the valley. It skipped two generations of women in our family, but it sure didn't bypass you, Laila. The valley Mammy referred to was the Panjshir, the Farsi-speaking Tajik region one hundred kilometers northeast of Kabul. Both Mammy and Babi, who were first cousins, had been born and raised in Panjshir; they had moved to Kabul back in 1960 as hopeful, bright-eyed newlyweds when Babi had been admitted to Kabul University.</div>

<div class="line_en">The rip in the screen had been there for weeks. Laila hunkered down beside him. "No. Must be new."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="纱门上的裂缝已经存在好几个星期了。莱拉在他身旁蹲下去。“没有啊，肯定是刚裂开的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Laila's heart went out to him. Babi was a small man, with narrow shoulders and slim, delicate hands, almost like a woman's. At night, when Laila walked into Babi's room, she always found the downward profile of his face burrowing into a book, his glasses perched on the tip of his nose. Sometimes he didn't even notice that she was there. When he did, he marked his page, smiled a close-lipped, companionable smile. Babi knew most of Rumi's and Hafez's ghazals by heart. He could speak at length about the struggle between Britain and czarist Russia over Afghanistan. He knew the difference between a stalactite and a stalagmite, and could tell you that the distance between the earth and the sun was the same as going from Kabul to Ghazni one and a half million times. But if Laila needed the lid of a candy jar forced open, she had to go to Mammy, which felt like a betrayal. Ordinary tools befuddled Babi. On his watch, squeaky door hinges never got oiled. Ceilings went on leaking after he plugged them. Mold thrived defiantly in kitchen cabinets. Mammy said that before he left with Noor to join the jihad against the Soviets, back in 1980, it was Ahmad who had dutifully and competently minded these things.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱拉偏袒他。爸爸是个矮小的男人，肩膀很窄，双手又嫩又细长，简直跟女人的手差不多。夜里，每当莱拉走进爸爸的房间，总能看到他的脸庞向下的轮廓，埋在一本书中，眼镜架在他的鼻尖上。有时候他甚至没有发现莱拉走进了房间。他若发现了，便会给看到的那一页书做上记号，嘴唇紧闭，露出一个和蔼的微笑。爸爸能够背诵鲁米[2]和哈菲兹[3]的多数诗篇。他能详细地说起阿富汗抗击英国和沙皇俄国的战争。他能分辨钟乳石和石笋的差别，能告诉人们地球和太阳的距离是喀布尔和加兹尼之间距离的150万倍。但如果莱拉需要打开一个盖得很紧的糖果罐，她便只能去找妈妈了，这让她觉得跟背叛了爸爸一样。爸爸连日常的工具都不会用。他从来不会给吱嘎响的房门铰链上润滑油。他修补的天花板照样漏水。霉菌在橱柜里疯狂地生长。妈妈说在艾哈迈德和努尔参加抗击苏联的圣战组织之前，艾哈迈德总是把这些事情处理得井井有条。【注：[2]Mowlana Jalaluddin Rumi（1207～1273），古代波斯诗人。[3]Shamseddin Mohammad Hafez（约1320～约1388），古代波斯诗人。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="尽管她这么说，但莱拉还是能察觉出来，在艾哈迈德和努尔参加抗击苏联的战斗之前——在爸爸放他们去战场之前——妈妈也曾觉得爸爸的书呆子习气很可爱，也曾为他的健忘和笨拙着迷。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Babi ran his finger through the rip. "I'll patch this as soon as I get a chance. We'd better go." He raised his voice and called over his shoulder, "We're going now, Fariba! I'm taking Laila to school. Don't forget to pick her up!"</div>

<div class="line_en">Outside, as she was climbing on the carrier pack of Babi's bicycle, Laila spotted a car parked up the street, across from the house where the shoemaker, Rasheed, lived with his reclusive wife. It was a Benz, an unusual car in this neighborhood, blue with a thick white stripe bisecting the hood, the roof, and the trunk. Laila could make out two men sitting inside, one behind the wheel, the other in the back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="外面，莱拉正要爬上爸爸的自行车的车后架，这时她看到街道上停着一辆轿车，就停在鞋匠拉希德和他那个深居简出的妻子所住的房子对面。那是一辆奔驰，他们这个街区很少见到的轿车，蓝色的，一道白色的粗线条从中间将引擎盖、车顶和行李箱分成两边。莱拉能看出车中坐着两个男人，一个坐在司机的座位上，一个坐在后座。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Babi pedaled up the street, Laila on the back, her arms wrapped around his belly. As they passed the blue Benz, Laila caught a fleeting glimpse of the man in the backseat: thin, white-haired, dressed in a dark brown suit, with a white handkerchief triangle in the breast pocket. The only other thing she had time to notice was that the car had Herat license plates.</div>

<div class="line_en">The teacher's name was Shanzai, but, behind her back, the students called her Khala Rangmaal, Auntie Painter, referring to the motion she favored when she slapped students -- palm, then back of the hand, back and forth, like a painter working a brush. Khala Rangmaal was a sharp-faced young woman with heavy eyebrows. On the first day of school, she had proudly told the class that she was the daughter of a poor peasant from Khost. She stood straight, and wore her jet-black hair pulled tightly back and tied in a bun so that, when Khala Rangmaal turned around, Laila could see the dark bristles on her neck. Khala Rangmaal did not wear makeup or jewelry. She did not cover and forbade the female students from doing it. She said women and men were equal in every way and there was no reason women should cover if men didn't.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="老师的名字叫单莎伊，但学生背地里都叫她画家阿姨，形容她喜欢打学生耳光的方式——先是手掌，接着是手背，来回地甩，就像画家用笔的方式一样。画家阿姨尖嘴猴腮，眉毛很浓。上课的第一天，她骄傲地告诉学生，说她是霍斯特[4]一个穷苦农民的女儿。她站立的姿势很笔挺，乌黑的头发紧紧地在脑后扎成一个发髻，所以每当画家阿姨转过身，莱拉能看见她脖子上粗黑的鬃毛。画家阿姨不化妆，也不佩戴珠宝首饰。她从不戴头巾，也禁止女生这么做。她说女人和男人从任何方面来讲都是平等的，如果男人不用戴头巾，那么没有理由要求女人戴。【注：[4]Khost，阿富汗东南部城市，位于阿富汗与巴基斯坦的边境。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This was her nickname for Laila, Revolutionary Girl, because she'd been born the night of the April coup of 1978-- except Khala Rangmaal became angry if anyone in her class used the word coup. What had happened, she insisted, was an inqilab, a revolution, an uprising of the working people against inequality. Jihad was another forbidden word. According to her, there wasn't even a war out there in the provinces, just skirmishes against troublemakers stirred by people she called foreign provocateurs. And certainly no one, no one, dared repeat in her presence the rising rumors that, after eight years of fighting, the Soviets were losing this war. Particularly now that the American president, Reagan, had started shipping the Mujahideen Stinger Missiles to down the Soviet helicopters, now that Muslims from all over the world were joining the cause: Egyptians, Pakistanis, even wealthy Saudis, who left their millions behind and came to Afghanistan to fight the jihad.</div>

<div class="line_en">Giti's hand shot up to her chin, and she looked with alarm to Laila, who smiled pityingly -- Giti was the most humorless person Laila had ever met -- and shook her head with reassurance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉提的手赶紧向下巴摸去，忧心忡忡地看着莱拉。莱拉露出怜悯的微笑——吉提是莱拉见过的人中最没有幽默感的一个——摇头宽慰她。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Laila could have said then that she didn't need this advice because Babi had no intention of giving her away anytime soon. Though Babi worked at Silo, Kabul's gigantic bread factory, where he labored amid the heat and the humming machinery stoking the massive ovens and mill grains all day, he was a university-educated man. He'd been a high school teacher before the communists fired him -- this was shortly after the coup of 1978, about a year and a half before the Soviets had invaded. Babi had made it clear to Laila from a young age that the most important thing in his life, after her safety, was her schooling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱拉本来可以说她不需要这个建议，因为爸爸一点都不打算这么快就把她许配给人。爸爸在塞罗上班，那是喀布尔一家规模庞大的面包厂，他整天在炎热和轰鸣的机器中劳作，不停地给那些巨大的烤炉鼓风，磨面粉，但尽管如此，他究竟是一个上过大学的人。他担任过一家高中的教师，后来被新政府解雇了——那是1978年的暴乱之后不久的事，距离苏联入侵还有一年六个月。从莱拉小时候起，爸爸就跟她说得很清楚，除了她的安全之外，他生命中最重要的东西就是她的教育。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But Laila didn't tell Hasina that Babi had said these things, or how glad she was to have a father like him, or how proud she was of his regard for her, or how determined she was to pursue her education just as he had his. For the last two years, Laila had received the awal numra certificate, given yearly to the top-ranked student in each grade. She said nothing of these things to Hasina, though, whose own father was an ill-tempered taxi driver who in two or three years would almost certainly give her away. Hasina had told Laila, in one of her infrequent serious moments, that it had already been decided that she would marry a first cousin who was twenty years older than her and owned an auto shop in Lahore. I've seen him twice, Hasina had said. Both times he ate with his mouth open.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，莱拉没有跟哈西娜提起爸爸讲过的这些话，没有说她为有这样的父亲而多么高兴，没有说她为他的评价而觉得非常骄傲，也没有说她已经下定决心，要以他为榜样，去接受高等教育。过去两年来，莱拉都拿到了优秀学生奖状。这种奖状每年发一次，各个年级学习成绩最好的学生才能得到。不过她没有跟哈西娜提起这些话，后者的父亲是一个脾气暴躁的出租车司机，很有可能再过两三年就把她嫁出去。有一次，难得正经的哈西娜认真地对莱拉说她的婚事已经定了，对象是她的表哥，比她大二十岁，在拉合尔[5]开一家汽车商店。我见过他两次，哈西娜当时说，每次吃饭他的嘴巴都是张开的。【注：[5]Lahore，巴基斯坦城市。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I know you're still young, but I want you to understand and learn this now, he said. Marriage can wait, education cannot. You're a very, very bright girl. Truly, you are. You can be anything you want, Laila. I know this about you. And I also know that when this war is over, Afghanistan is going to need you as much as its men, maybe even more. Because a society has no chance of success if its women are uneducated, Laila. No chance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我知道你还小，但我希望你现在就明白并且记住这个道理，他说，婚姻可以等待，教育却不行。你是一个非常、非常聪明的女孩。真的是。你想成为什么样的人都可以如愿以偿，莱拉。这一点我很清楚。我还知道等到这场战争结束了，阿富汗将会像需要它的男人一样需要你，甚至比需要它的男人更加需要你。因为，如果一个社会的女人没有受过教育，那么这个社会就没有进步的可能，莱拉。没有可能。">查看中文翻译</div>
