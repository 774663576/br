<div class="line_en">The Edinburgh hotel is plush, traditional and grand, oak panels and porcelain baths. His parents stayed here once, for his graduation, and it's a little more old-fashioned and expensive than he would like, but he thought that if they're going to do this, they should do it in some style. They are staying for two nights -- Dexter, Maddy and Jasmine -- before hiring a car and driving across to a holiday cottage near Loch Lomond. Glasgow is nearer of course, but Dexter hasn't been to Edinburgh for fifteen years, not since a debauched weekend when he presented a TV show from the Festival. All of that seems a long, long time ago now, another lifetime. Today he has a fatherly notion that he might show his daughter round the city. Maddy, aware of the date, has decided to leave them to it.</div>

<div class="line_en">The hotel is in the Old Town, just off the Royal Mile, and Dexter takes Jasmine on the standard atmospheric tour, down alleyways and secret stairways until they find themselves on Nicolson Street, heading south out of the city centre. He remembers the street as hectic and hazy with bus fumes, but on a Sunday morning it is quiet and a little sad, and Jasmine is starting to get restless and bored now that they have left the tourist trail. Feeling her hand go heavy in his, Dexter keeps on walking. He has found the old address on one of Emma's letters and soon spots a sign. Rankeillor Street. They turn into the quiet residential road.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那家旅店在老城区，在同皇家英里路相交的一条街上。德克斯特带着贾斯敏漫步在小巷和神秘的阶梯之间，一路朝着南郊走去。记忆中，那是条繁忙的街道，笼罩着公共汽车灰蒙蒙的尾气。但这个星期天的早晨，这里安静得竟有些许哀伤。他们一刻不停地走着，出离了观光客的例行路线后，贾斯敏烦躁不安起来，她捏在德克斯特手中的小手也渐渐沉重。此前，德克斯特终于看到了爱玛一封书信里写的地址：兰基勒街。他们转弯走上了居民区安静的小道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They are outside now. Dexter peers up at the third-floor window, its curtains drawn, blank and nondescript.</div>

<div class="line_en">"You see that flat there? That's where Emma used to live when we were at University together. In fact that's sort of where we met." Jasmine looks up obediently, but there is nothing to distinguish the unremarkable terraced house from those on either side, and Dexter starts to question the wisdom of this expedition. It's indulgent, morbid and sentimental; what was he expecting to find? There is nothing here that he recalls, and the pleasure gained from nostalgia is slight and futile. For a moment he contemplates abandoning the tour, phoning Maddy and arranging to meet a little earlier, but Jasmine is pointing to the end of the street, the granite escarpment that looms incongruously over the estate below.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你看到那问公寓了？我和爱玛在同一所大学上学时，她就住在这儿。其实这也算是我们真正相遇的地方。”贾斯敏依言抬头望去，却分辨不出这座毫不起眼的排屋同两边的建筑有何不同。德克斯特也开始怀疑此行的意义。说不定只是一种无病呻吟，他又能有什么指望？它没有唤起他的任何回忆，怀旧情绪也没带来多大快意。他忽然想中止这次行动，并告知马蒂。但就在这时，贾斯敏指着街道尽头那俯瞰着房舍的花岗岩陡坡。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“那是因为我的鞋底打滑，不好爬。”他抗议着。他们继续向上爬，离开大路，踩着岩石，最后终于踉跄着来到一片灌木丛生的铁锈色高地，亚瑟王座山的峰顶，看到了山顶的标志碑。他查看着上面的划痕和涂鸦，隐隐地希望能发现自己的签名。碑上除了“大战法西斯”、“M。阿列克斯070505”、“永9的菲奥娜”之外，还有些淫秽的涂鸦，">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我？开玩笑，我是个天生的运动员、”贾斯敏笑着模仿他的话，一手握拳放在胸前，用作麦克风。“喜剧演员。”他双手插在她的腋下，把她抱下来，荡着她，假装要把她扔下山，听着她尖叫大笑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As they approached the park exit, Emma became aware that they would soon be saying goodbye, and that there was every chance that they would never see each other again. There might be parties, she supposed, but they both knew a different crowd, and besides he would be off travelling soon. Even if they did see each other it would be fleeting and formal, and he would soon forget everything that had happened in that small rented room in the early hours of the morning. As they stumbled down the hill she began to feel regret creeping up on her, and realised she didn't want him to go yet. A second night. She wanted one more night at least, so that they could finish what they had started. How might she say that? She couldn't of course. Fainthearted as usual, she had left it too late. In the future, I'll be braver, she told herself. In the future, I will always speak my mind, eloquently, passionately. They were at the park gates now, the place where she should probably say goodbye.</div>

<div class="line_en">Emma and Dexter spent the rest of that afternoon on the hillside laughing and talking, offering up information about themselves: what their parents did, how many siblings they had, telling favoured anecdotes. In the middle of the afternoon, as if by mutual agreement, they both fell asleep, lying chastely in parallel until at five Dexter woke with a start, and they gathered together the empty bottles and the remains of the picnic and started to head woozily down the hill towards the city and home.</div>

This would give him nearly two whole hours. Callum would be with his girlfriend, they'd have the flat to themselves for two whole hours, and he would be able to kiss her again. The high-ceilinged white-walled rooms were empty save for his suitcases and a few pieces of furniture, the mattress in his bedroom, the old chaise-longue. A couple of dust-sheets and it would look like the set of a Russian play. He knew enough about Emma to know that she would be a sucker for that, and he would almost certainly be able to kiss her, even sober. Whatever happened between them in the future, whatever rows and repercussions loomed, he knew that he very much wanted to kiss her now. The walk would take another fifteen minutes. He found himself slightly breathless. They should have got a cab.</div>

<div class="line_en">Perhaps she had the same idea because they really were walking very fast as they headed down the steep incline of Dundas Street, their elbows occasionally brushing against each other, the Forth hazy in the distance. After all these years she was still elated by the sight of the iron-blue river in between the terraces of fine Georgian houses. "I might have known you'd live round here," she said, disapproving but envious, and as she spoke she found herself short of breath. She was going back to his well-appointed flat, they were going to do it, and she was embarrassed to find her neck flushing pink in anticipation. She ran her tongue over her teeth, attempting an ineffectual polish. Did she need to brush her teeth? Champagne always made her breath smell. Should they stop for chewing gum? Or condoms, would Dexter have condoms? Of course he would; it was like asking if he had shoes. But should she brush her teeth or should she just throw herself at him as the door closed? She tried to recall what underwear she was wearing, then remembered that it was her special mountain-climbing underwear. Too late to worry about that; they had turned into Fettes Row.</div>

<div class="line_en">Emma noticed how Dexter dropped her hand, almost throwing it away from him as he crossed the street and embraced his mother. With a further spasm of irritation she noticed that Mrs Mayhew was extremely beautiful and stylishly dressed, the father less so, a tall, sombre, dishevelled man, clearly unhappy to have been kept waiting. The mother met Emma's eyes over her son's shoulder and gave an indulgent, consolatory smile, almost as if she knew. It was the look a duchess might give, finding her errant son kissing the housemaid.</div>

Forty-seven, forty-five, forty-three.

These people seemed nice enough, but it wasn't what she wanted, gate-crashing someone else's family occasion. They would be going somewhere swanky and she looked like a lumberjack and besides, really, what was the point? Sitting there gazing at Dexter while they asked what her parents did for a living, where she went to school. Already she could feel herself shrinking from this family's brash self-confidence, their showy affection for each other, their money and style and grace. She would become shy or, worse, drunk and neither would help her chances. Best give up. She managed a smile. "Actually, I better head back."</div>

In one way or another it seemed that people had been asking her this forever; teachers, her parents, friends at three in the morning, but the question had never seemed this pressing and still she was no nearer an answer.

Fear of the future, she thought. She found herself at the imposing junction of George Street and Hanover Street as all around her people hurried home from work or out to meet friends or lovers, all with a sense of purpose and direction. And here she was, twenty-two and clueless and sloping back to a dingy flat, defeated once again.</div>

<div class="line_en">She began walking again, south towards The Mound. "Live each day as if it's your last", that was the conventional advice, but really, who had the energy for that? What if it rained or you felt a bit glandy? It just wasn't practical. Better by far to simply try and be good and courageous and bold and to make a difference. Not change the world exactly, but the bit around you. Go out there with your passion and your electric typewriter and work hard at… something. Change lives through art maybe. Cherish your friends, stay true to your principles, live passionately and fully and well. Experience new things. Love and be loved, if you ever get the chance.</div>

<div class="line_en">That was her general theory, even if she hadn't made a very good start of it. With little more than a shrug she had said goodbye to someone she really liked, the first boy she had ever really cared for, and now she would have to accept the fact that she would probably never see him again. She had no phone number, no address, and even if she did, what was the point? He hadn't asked for her number either, and she was too proud to be just another moony girl leaving unwanted messages. Have a nice life had been her last line. Was that really the best she could come up with?</div>
