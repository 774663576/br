<div class="line_en">Panic spurred her, and the ache in her side diminished a little. She pulled herself up as fast as she could regardless of the pain, yanking convulsively at the banister. She reached the top and threw a glance behind her.</div>

<div class="line_en">He seemed to be gaining strength rather than losing it. He was only four risers from the top, measuring the distance with the rogue mallet in his left hand as he pulled himself up with his right.</div>

<div class="line_en">Wendy risked another glance over her shoulder. Jack was on the sixth riser, clinging to the banister much as she was doing herself. He was still grinning, and dark blood oozed slowly through the grin and slipped down the line of his jaw. He bared his teeth at her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="温迪冒险回头看了一眼。杰克已经到了第六级楼梯，抓在栏杆上，跟她自己一样。他还是咧着嘴，黑色的血慢慢从咧开的嘴角里渗出来，沿着下颚流下去，他对她呲了呲牙。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm going to bash your brains in. Bash them right to fuck in." He struggled up another riser.</div>

<div class="line_en">The door to one of the rooms jerked open and a man with a green ghoulmask on popped out. "Great party, isn't it?" He screamed into her face, and pulled the waxed string of a party-favor. There was an echoing bang and suddenly crepe streamers were drifting all around her. The man in the ghoulmask cackled and slammed back into his room. She fell forward onto the carpet, full-length. Her right side seemed to explode with pain, and she fought off the blackness of unconsciousness desperately. Dimly she could hear the elevator running again, and beneath her splayed fingers she could see that the carpet pattern appeared to move, swaying and twining sinuously.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一间客房的门哐地开了，一个人戴着绿色的食尸鬼面具跳了出来…晚会不错，是吧？。他对着她的脸尖叫道，扯了一下晚会礼品袋的蜡线绳。砰地一声，她的周围顿时堆满了丝绸彩带。戴食尸鬼面具的男人咯咯一笑，钻进了他的房间，砰的一声关上门。她直挺挺地扑倒在了地毯上，右肋痛得好像要爆炸了。她拼尽全力才没有陷入无意识的黑暗状态中去。隐隐约约地，她又听到电梯运转起来了，在她分开的手指之间她能看到地毯的图案好像活了，荡来荡去，扭扭曲曲地缠绕着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Over her shoulder she saw Jack stumble forward, overbalance, and bring the mallet down just before he crashed to the carpet, expelling a bright splash of blood onto the nap.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她扭头看见杰克向前一倾，失去了平衡，紧随着木槌倒在了地毯上，一股鲜血喷了出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The mallet head struck her squarely between the shoulder blades and for a moment the agony was so great that she could only writhe, hands opening and clenching. Something inside her had snapped -- she had heard it clearly, and for a few moments she was aware only in a muted, muffled way, as if she were merely observing these things through a cloudy wrapping of gauze.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="木槌不偏不斜正好砸在了她的两块肩胛骨之间，有一会儿，她痛得直抽搐，手指伸开又收拢。她体内有什么东西断了——她听得很清楚，有那么几秒钟，她只是朦朦胧胧地有些知觉，好像她是透过一层云雾般的薄纱在观察这一切。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Wendy tried to stand and found it was impossible. Electric bolts seemed to course up and down her back at the effort. She began to crawl along in a sidestroke motion. Jack was crawling after her, using the roque mallet as a crutch or a cane.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="温迪也想站起来，但发现这是不可能的。她一用力，背上就好像接连不断地挨着电击。她开始侧身匍匐向前爬起来，杰克紧跟在她后面，木槌变成了他的拐杖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She reached the comer and pulled herself around it, using her hands to yank at the angle of the wall. Her terror deepened -- she would not have believed that possible, but it was. It was a hundred times worse not to be able to see him or know how close he was getting. She tore out fistfuls of the carpet napping pulling herself along, and she was halfway down this short hall before she noticed the bedroom door was standing wide open.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她到了拐角处，双手攀在墙角棱上，拉着自己往过去绕。她的恐惧更深了——她不愿相信这是可能的，但确实是。糟糕透顶，她现在看不见他了，也不知道他离得有多近。她往前挪啊挪，从地毯上扯出了一把一把的绒毛，她在短走廊上爬了一半才发现卧室门敞开着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She ignored the pain and halfwalked, half-shambled through the doorway as Jack came around the far corner and began to lunge his way down toward the open door, leaning on the roque mallet.</div>

<div class="line_en">She caught the edge of the dresser, held herself up against it, and grabbed the doorframe.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她抓住了梳妆台的边缘，靠着它站起来，抓住了门框。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She forced herself to her knees and then clawed her way to her feet, fingers slipping over the silk wallpaper. Her nails pulled little strips of it loose.</div>

<div class="line_en">She slammed it closed and shot the bolt. Her left hand pawed wildly at the junk on the dresser, knocking loose coins onto the floor where they rolled in every direction. Her hand seized the key ring just as the mallet whistled down against the door, making it tremble in its frame. She got the key into the lock on the second stab and twisted it to the right. At the sound of the tumblers falling, Jack screamed. The mallet came down against the door in a volley of booming blows that made her flinch and step back. How could he be doing that with a knife in his back? Where was he finding the strength? She wanted to shriek Why aren't you dead? at the locked door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她砰地一声摔上门，闩上了插销。她的左手在梳妆台上胡乱地摸索着，把硬币打落到地上，硬币滚得满地都是。她抓着了钥匙圈，这时，木槌落在了门上，砸得门板在门框里直颤抖。她插了两次才把钥匙插进锁里，然后向右旋。听到锁簧落下的声音，杰克尖叫起来。木槌落在门上，发出了接连不断的砰砰声，吓得她直往后退。他背上插着一把刀，怎么能砸得这样有力？他的力量是从哪里来的？她想对着紧闭的门大吼：你为什么不死？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Instead she turned around. She and Danny would have to go into the attached bathroom and lock that door, too, in case Jack actually could break through the bedroom door. The thought of escaping down the dumb-waiter shaft crossed her mind in a wild burst, and then she rejected it. Danny was small enough to fit into it, but she would be unable to control the rope pull. He might go crashing all the way to the bottom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，她却转了过去。她和丹尼必须躲进浴室里去，把那道门也锁上，要是杰克真的砸破了卧室门的话。她脑子里突然萌生出从送菜机升降井逃下去的想法，紧接着又打消了。丹尼身子小可以下去，但她没法控制拉绳，他可能会一路摔到底的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She hobbled toward the bathroom and as she reached the door she glanced back over her shoulder. The mallet crashed through again, widening the hole, and then a hand appeared, groping for the bolt. She saw with horror that she had left Jack's key ring dangling from the lock.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她瘸着腿往浴室走去，来到门边后她向后看了一眼。木槌又砸进了门板，洞更大了，这时，一只手伸进来了，摸索着插销。她惊恐地发现她把钥匙串吊在锁上了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The next blow brought a sickening, splintering crack, the sound of dry kindling under a hatchet. The bloody mallet head, now splintered and gouged in its own right, bashed through the new hole in the door, was withdrawn, and came down again, sending wooden shrapnel flying across the room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着又是一槌，砸出了令人心悸的碎裂声，就是那种斧头劈干柴的声音。沾满血污的槌头已经破损了，凹陷了，它又在门上打出了一个洞，收回去，落下来，砸得木片满屋飞。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The bathroom was empty. Danny wasn't here, either. And as she caught sight of her own bloodsmeared, horrified face in the medicine cabinet mirror, she was glad. She had never believed that children should be witness to the little quarrels of their parents. And perhaps the thing that was now raving through the bedroom, overturning things and smashing them, would finally collapse before it could go after her son. Perhaps, she thought, it might be possible for her to inflict even more damage on it… kill it, perhaps.</div>

It alternately whined in tones of self-pity and rose in lurid screams; it reminded her chillingly of the screams that sometimes rose in the geriatrics ward of the hospital where she had worked summers as a high school kid.
