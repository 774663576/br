<div class="line_en">The queen had been a Mexican girl from Laredo. She made a good, mild, Colorado-claro wife, and even succeeded in teaching Ben to modify his voice sufficiently while in the house to keep the dishes from being broken. When Ben got to be king she would sit on the gallery of Espinosa Ranch and weave rush mats. When wealth became so irresistible and oppressive that upholstered chairs and a centre table were brought down from San Antone in the wagons, she bowed her smooth, dark head, and shared the fate of the Danae.</div>

<div class="line_en">Josefa O'Donnell was the surviving daughter, the princess. From her mother she inherited warmth of nature and a dusky, semi-tropic beauty. From Ben O'Donnell the royal she acquired a store of intrepidity, common sense, and the faculty of ruling. The combination was one worth going miles to see. Josefa while riding her pony at a gallop could put five out of six bullets through a tomato-can swinging at the end of a string. She could play for hours with a white kitten she owned, dressing it in all manner of absurd clothes. Scorning a pencil, she could tell you out of her head what 1545 two-year-olds would bring on the hoof, at $8.50 per head. Roughly speaking, the Espinosa Ranch is forty miles long and thirty broad -- but mostly leased land. Josefa, on her pony, had prospected over every mile of it. Every cow-puncher on the range knew her by sight and was a loyal vassal. Ripley Givens, foreman of one of the Espinosa outfits, saw her one day, and made up his mind to form a royal matrimonial alliance. Presumptuous? No. In those days in the Nueces country a man was a man. And, after all, the title of cattle king does not presuppose blood royalty. Often it only signifies that its owner wears the crown in token of his magnificent qualities in the art of cattle stealing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="约瑟法·奥唐奈是仅存的女儿，也就是公主。她从母亲那儿秉承了热情的性格和亚热带的那种皮肤微黑的美。她从本恩·奥唐奈皇上那儿获得了大量的魄力、常识和统治才能。要瞻仰这样结合起来的人物，即使跑上许多路都值得。约瑟法骑马疾驰的时候，能够瞄准一只拴在绳上的蕃茄铁皮罐，六枪之中可以打中五枪。她同自己的一只小白猫可以一连玩上好几个钟头，给它穿上各式各样可笑的衣服。她不用铅笔，光凭心算，很快就能告诉你：一千五百四十五头两岁的小牛，每头八块五毛，总共可以卖多少钱。大致说来，多刺牧场面积有四十英里长、三十英里宽——不过大部分是租来的土地。约瑟法骑着马儿，踏勘了牧场的每一块土地。牧场上的每一个牧童都认识她，都对她忠心耿耿。里普利·吉文斯是多刺牧场上一个牛队的头目，有一天见到了她，便打定主意要同皇室联姻。僭妄吗？不见得。那时候，纽西斯一带的男子都是顶天立地的大丈夫。并且说到头，牛皇帝的称号并不代表皇室的血统。它多半只说明：拥有这种称号的人在偷牛方面特别高明而已。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a fine water hole in the river-bed. The banks were thickly covered with great trees, undergrown with brush. Back from the water hole fifty yards was a stretch of curly mesquite grass -- supper for his horse and bed for himself. Givens staked his horse, and spread out his saddle blankets to dry. He sat down with his back against a tree and rolled a cigarette. From somewhere in the dense timber along the river came a sudden, rageful, shivering wail. The pony danced at the end of his rope and blew a whistling snort of comprehending fear. Givens puffed at his cigarette, but he reached leisurely for his pistol-belt, which lay on the grass, and twirled the cylinder of his weapon tentatively. A great gar plunged with a loud splash into the water hole. A little brown rabbit skipped around a bunch of catclaw and sat twitching his whiskers and looking humorously at Givens. The pony went on eating grass.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="河床上有个水坑，水很清洁。两岸长满了茂密的大树和灌木。离水坑五十码远有一片卷曲的牧豆草地——为他的坐骑提供了晚餐，为他自己准备了床铺。吉文斯拴好马，摊开鞍毯，让它晾晾干。他靠着树坐下，卷了一支纸烟。河边的密林里突然传来一声发威而震撼人心的吼叫。拴着的小马腾跃起来，害怕地喷着鼻息。吉文斯抽着烟，不慌不忙地伸手去拿放在草地上的枪套皮带，拔出枪，转转弹膛试试。一尾大（鱼箴）鱼噗通一声窜进水坑。一只棕色的小兔子绕过一丛猫爪草，坐下来，胡子牵动着，滑稽地瞅着吉文斯。小马继续吃草。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One day Ripley Givens rode over to the Double Elm Ranch to inquire about a bunch of strayed yearlings. He was late in setting out on his return trip, and it was sundown when he struck the White Horse Crossing of the Nueces. From there to his own camp it was sixteen miles. To the Espinosa ranch it was twelve. Givens was tired. He decided to pass the night at the Crossing.</div>

<div class="line_en">It is well to be reasonably watchful when a Mexican lion sings soprano along the arroyos at sundown. The burden of his song may be that young calves and fat lambs are scarce, and that he has a carnivorous desire for your acquaintance.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the grass lay an empty fruit can, cast there by some former sojourner. Givens caught sight of it with a grunt of satisfaction. In his coat pocket tied behind his saddle was a handful or two of ground coffee. Black coffee and cigarettes! What ranchero could desire more?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="草丛里有一只空水果罐头，是以前过路人扔在那儿的。吉文斯看到它，满意地哼了一声。在他那件缚在马鞍后面的上衣口袋里，有一些碾碎的咖啡豆。清咖啡和纸烟！牧牛人有了这两样东西，还指望别的什么呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In two minutes he had a little fire going clearly. He started, with his can, for the water hole. When within fifteen yards of its edge he saw, between the bushes, a side-saddled pony with down-dropped reins cropping grass a little distance to his left. Just rising from her hands and knees on the brink of the water hole was Josefa O'Donnell. She had been drinking water, and she brushed the sand from the palms of her hands. Ten yards away, to her right, half concealed by a clump of sacuista, Givens saw the crouching form of the Mexican lion. His amber eyeballs glared hungrily; six feet from them was the tip of the tail stretched straight, like a pointer's. His hind-quarters rocked with the motion of the cat tribe preliminary to leaping.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不出两分钟，他生起了一小堆明快的篝火。他拿着罐头朝水坑走去。在离水坑十五码时，他从灌木枝叶的空隙中看到左边不远处有一匹备女鞍的小马，搭拉着缰绳在啃草。约瑟法·奥唐奈趴在水坑旁边喝了水，站了起来，正在擦去掌心的泥沙。吉文斯还看到在她右边十来码远的荆棘丛中，有一头蹲着的墨西哥狮子。它的琥珀色的眼睛射出饥饿的光芒，眼睛后面六英尺的地方是象猎狗猛扑前那样伸得笔直的尾巴。它挪动后腿，那是猫科动物跳跃前的常态。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Josefa was standing in her tracks, quietly reloading her silver- mounted.38. It had not been a difficult shot. The lion's head made an easier mark than a tomato-can swinging at the end of a string. There was a provoking, teasing, maddening smile upon her mouth and in her dark eyes. The would-be-rescuing knight felt the fire of his fiasco burn down to his soul. Here had been his chance, the chance that he had dreamed of; and Momus, and not Cupid, had presided over it. The satyrs in the wood were, no doubt, holding their sides in hilarious, silent laughter. There had been something like vaudeville -- say Signor Givens and his funny knockabout act with the stuffed lion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="约瑟法站在原来的地方，若无其事地在重新填装她那把镶银把柄的三八口径手枪。这样射击并不困难。狮子脑袋同悬在绳子上的蕃茄罐头相比，目标要大多了。她嘴角和黑眼睛里带着一丝挑逗、嘲弄和叫人恼火的笑意。这位救人未遂的侠士觉得丢脸的火焰一直烧到他的灵魂。这本来是他的大好机会，梦寐以求的机会；可是成全他的不是爱神丘比特，而是嘲弄之神摩摩斯。毫无疑问，森林中的精灵们一定在捧着肚子窃窃暗笑。这简直成了一出滑稽戏——吉文斯先生同剥制狮子一起演出的滑稽闹剧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Givens did what he could. His six-shooter was thirty-five yards away lying on the grass. He gave a loud yell, and dashed between the lion and the princess.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉文斯做了他力所能及的事。他的六响手枪在三十五码以外的草地上。他暴喊一声，窜到狮子和公主中间。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The "rucus," as Givens called it afterward, was brief and somewhat confused. When he arrived on the line of attack he saw a dim streak in the air, and heard a couple of faint cracks. Then a hundred pounds of Mexican lion plumped down upon his head and flattened him, with a heavy jar, to the ground. He remembered calling out: "Let up, now -- no fair gouging!" and then he crawled from under the lion like a worm, with his mouth full of grass and dirt, and a big lump on the back of his head where it had struck the root of a water-elm. The lion lay motionless. Givens, feeling aggrieved, and suspicious of fouls, shook his fist at the lion, and shouted: "I'll rastle you again for twenty --" and then he got back to himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉文斯事后所说的这场“格斗”是短暂而有点混乱的。当他冲到战线上时，他看见空中掠过一道模糊的影子，又听到两声隐约的枪响。紧接着，百来磅重的墨西哥狮子落到了他头上，噗的一声重重地把他压倒在地。他还记得自己喊道：“让我起来——这种打法不公道！”然后，他象毛虫似地从狮子身下爬出来，满嘴的青草和污泥，后脑勺磕在水榆树根上，鼓了一个大包。狮子一动不动地瘫在地上。吉文斯大为不满，并且觉得受了骗。他对狮子晃晃拳头，嚷道：“我跟你再来二十回合——”可他立即省悟过来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，没什么，”吉文斯平静地说，“摔得不重。”他屈辱地弯下腰，把他那顶最好的斯特森帽子从狮子身下抽出来。帽子压得一团糟，很有喜剧效果。接着，他跪下去，轻轻地抚摸着死狮子那张着大嘴、好不吓人的脑袋。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The old rascal ran away from camp yesterday," answered Givens readily. "It's a wonder the coyotes didn't scare him to death. You see, Jim Webster, our horse wrangler, brought a little terrier pup into camp last week. The pup made life miserable for Bill -- he used to chase him around and chew his hind legs for hours at a time. Every night when bedtime came Bill would sneak under one of the boy's blankets and sleep to keep the pup from finding him. I reckon he must have been worried pretty desperate or he wouldn't have run away. He was always afraid to get out of sight of camp."</div>

Slowly a red flush widened upon the dark olive face of the girl. Was it the signal of shame of the true sportsman who has brought down ignoble quarry? Her eyes grew softer, and the lowered lids drove away all their bright mockery.</div>
