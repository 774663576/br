<div class="line_en">"No, of course not! I'm quiet and careful with them, and with the little ones. I'm the best friend and riding teacher those children have. It's not them, it's the boys," he said. "The other children rode me for nearly two hours, then the boys rode me, one after the other, for an hour, hitting me with a stick. I didn't get annoyed but I did get tired, so I stopped once or twice to let them know. But boys think a horse is like a machine and can go on as long and as fast as they want it to. They never think that we get tired. As one was whipping me, I stood up on my back legs and he fell off. He got on again and I did the same. Then the other boy tried and I put him down on the grass. They're not bad boys, and don't mean to be cruel, but they have to learn."</div>

<div class="line_en">Aneighbour of the Gordons', Mr Blomefield, had a large family of boys and girls who often came to play with Miss Jessie and Miss Flora. One of the girls was the same age as Miss Jessie, two of the boys were older, and there were several little ones. Whenever they came, the children loved to ride Merrylegs.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I know you would," said Merrylegs. "But they expect me to look after those children, and they expect me to be good-tempered, and I will be. You never had a place where they were kind to you, Ginger, and I'm sorry for you. But good places make good horses, and I wouldn't make our people angry for anything! If I started kicking people, they would very quickly sell me, perhaps to someone cruel. I hope that never happens."</div>

<div class="line_en">"It was no accident!" he said, angrily. "My long and beautiful tail was cut off when I was a young horse. At that time, some owners thought it was fashionable!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哪有什么事故！”他气愤地说。“我的又长又美的尾巴在我小时候就被剪掉了。当时的一些马主人认为那样时髦！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, terrible and cruel," said Sir Oliver. "Now I can never brush the flies off my sides or back legs, and all because of fashion. Some owners cut off the tails of their dogs to make them look brave, or cut their pretty little ears to make them look fashionable. They don't cut off the ends of their children's ears, do they? Why do they think it's all right to do these things to their animals?"</div>

<div class="line_en">The man looked up. He was a builder who often came to the Park to do work. "He's too fond of going his own way!" he told my master. "He's not supposed to turn in through your gates; the road is straight on."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那人抬头看了一眼。他是个建筑工人，常来这儿干活。“他太爱想怎么干就怎么干了！”他对我的主人说。“他不该朝你的门里转，应该一直照直走。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mr Gordon was never cruel, and he would not stand by and watch others be cruel to animals. We were riding home one morning when we saw a big man driving towards us in a small carriage, pulled by a beautiful little pony. As he got to the Park gates, the pony turned towards them. Without warning, the man pulled the pony's head round so roughly that the little animal almost fell over. Then he began to whip the pony, angrily. The animal tried to move forward, but the man held it back and continued to whip it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="高顿先生从不冷酷，而且他也决不对其他人对动物的残酷行为坐视不管。一天早上我们回家，看见一个大个儿男人驾着一辆小马车向我们这边驶来，车子被一匹美丽的小马驹拉着。当他到庄园大门时，马驹朝大门转了过来。那人不容分说突然猛地一拉马头，用力很大，小马差点摔倒。然后那人开始狠狠地抽打小马。小马试着向前挪动，但那家伙又把马拉回来继续抽打。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You often drive that pony to my house," said my master. "It only shows that the horse is intelligent and remembers these things. How could he know you weren't going there today? I've never seen a horse beaten so cruelly or with so much anger. What will people think of you, Sawyer? As well as hurting the horse, you hurt your own good name -- do you want people to think of you as a cruel, bad-tempered man?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你常赶着他来我这儿，”我的主人说。“这只能说明他很聪明，还记着这些事。他怎么知道你今天不来这儿了？我从没见过哪个人这么凶狠这么生气地打过马。索亚，别人会怎么看你呢？你打伤这匹马的同时，也损害了你自己的名声——你想让大家觉得你是个冷酷的、坏脾气的人吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We went home slowly, and I could tell by his voice that the master was unhappy at what we had seen.</div>
