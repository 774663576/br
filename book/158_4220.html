<div class="line_en">The moment supper was served, Mr. Follenvie appeared with his old phrase:"The Prussian officer orders me to ask if Miss Elizabeth Rousset has yet changed her mind."</div>

<div class="line_en">During the whole afternoon they let her reflect. But, in the place of calling her"Madame" as they had up to this time, they simply called her"Mademoiselle"without knowing exactly why, as if they had a desire to put her down a degree in their esteem, which she had taken by storm, and make her feel her shameful situation.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ball-of-Fat responded dryly:"No, sir."</div>

<div class="line_en">But at dinner the coalition weakened. Loiseau made three unhappy remarks. Each one beat his wits for new examples but found nothing; when the Countess, without premeditation, perhaps feeling some vague need of rendering homage to religion, asked the elder of the good sisters to tell them some great deeds in the lives of the saints. It appeared that many of their acts would have been considered crimes in our eyes; but the Church gave absolution of them readily, since they were done for the glory of God, or for the good of all. It was a powerful argument; the Countess made the most of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过在饭桌上，同盟解体了。鸟老板说了三五句使人不大注意的话。每一个人都搜索枯肠去发现新的例子，然而却什么也找不着，这时候，伯爵夫人也许忽然感到一阵泛泛的需要想对天主教尊敬一番，于是对那个年龄较大的嬷嬷问起圣徒们生活中的伟大事迹。谁知有好多个圣徒做过的事，在我们看来都可以算是犯了重罪的行为；不过只要那都是为了上帝的光荣或者为了人类的幸福，天主教会并不处罚而都赦免了这类的罪恶。这是一种很有力的论据，伯爵夫人来利用它了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Thus it may be by one of those tacit understandings, or the veiled complacency in which anyone who wears the ecclesiastical garb excels, it may be simply from the effect of a happy unintelligence, a helpful stupidity, but in fact the religious sister lent a formidable support to the conspiracy. They had thought her timid, but she showed herself courageous, verbose, even vio-lent. She was not troubled by the chatter of the casuist; her doctrine seemed a bar of iron; her faith never hesitated; her conscience had no scruples. She found the sacrifice of Abraham perfectly simple, for she would immediately kill fathar or mother on an order from on high. And nothing, in her opinion, could displease the Lord, if the intention was laudable. The Countess put to use the authority of her unwitting accomplice, and added to it the edifying paraphrase and axiom of Jesuit morals:"The need justifies the means."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这样一来，年老的嬷嬷对阴谋带了一种巨大的支援，那或者由于一种默契，一种任何披着道袍的人最拿手的暗献殷勤，或者简单地由于一种凑巧的聪明的效力，一种可以受人利用的愚昧行为的效力。以前，人都以为她是胆怯的，现在，她显出她是胆大的、爱说话的、激烈的。这一个真没有被决疑论的暗中摸索搞糊涂，她的主义像铁一般坚硬，她的信仰心从不迟疑，她的良心毫没有顾虑。她认为亚伯拉罕的牺牲很简单，因为她本人若是接着了来自上苍的命令，可以立刻去杀父母，并且在她的见解里，只要居心可嘉，绝没有什么是可以使得主不快乐的。伯爵夫人利用她这来自望外的同谋者的神权，如同根据这种道德公理做了一个注脚似的向她说道：“结局是判断方法的标准哪。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then she asked her:"Then, my sister, do you think that God accepts intentions, and pardons the deed when the motive is pure?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随后她问嬷嬷了：“嬷嬷，那么您认定上帝容许一切方法，而在动机纯洁的时候上帝是原谅行为的？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And they continued thus, unraveling the will of God, foreseeing his decisions, making themselves interested in things that, in truth, they would never think of noticing. All this was guarded, skillful, discreet. But each word of the saintly sister in a cap helped to break down the resistance of the unworthy courtesan. Then the conversation changed a little, the woman of the chaplet speaking of the houses of her order, of her Superior, of herself, of her dainty neighbor, the dear sister Saint-Nicephore. They had been called to the hospitals of Havre to care for the hundreds of soldiers stricken with smallpox. They depicted these miserable creatures, giving details of the malady. And while they were stopped, en route, by the caprice of this Prussian officer, a great number of Frenchmen might die, whom perhaps they could have saved! It was a specialty with her, caring for soldiers. She had been in Crimea, in Italy, in Austria, and, in telling of her campaigns, she revealed herself as one of those religious aids to drums and trumpets, who seem made to follow camps, pick up the wounded in the thick of battle, and, better than an officer, subdue with a word great bands of undisciplined recruits. A true, good sister of the rataplan, whose ravaged face, marked with innumerable scars, appeared the image of the devastation of war.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她俩这样继续谈下去，讨论上帝的种种意志，预料他的种种决策，替他和好些真的不大和他有关的事拉上了关系。这一切议论都是含蓄的，巧妙的，慎重的，不过这个戴着尖角风帽的圣女的每一句话，都使那个出卖风情的女人的愤怒抵抗力受到了损伤。随后，谈话略略转换了方向，手挽念珠的女人谈到她会里的那些修道院，谈到她的院长，谈到她本人又谈到她那矫小的同伴汕尼塞傅尔嬷嬷。有人从哈佛尔找她们去看护各医院里的好几百个出天花的士兵。她描绘那些可怜的人，详细说明他们的病状。而这时候她们在路上偏偏被这个普鲁士人的坏脾气扣住不教走，所以有许多可能由她们救出来的法国士兵都难免死亡！看护军人原是她本人的专门技术，她曾经到过克里米亚，到过意大利，到过奥地利，说起自己在那些地方的战场经历，她陡然一下表白自己是个听熟了铜鼓和喇叭的女修道士，这类的修道士都像是为了追踪战场，为了在战役的漩涡当中收容伤员而生到世上的，若是说到用一句话去控制那些不守纪律的老兵，她们的效力比一个官长的来得大，这真是一个军队中的嬷嬷，她那张满是小窟窿的破了相的脸儿似乎是战争种种破坏力的一幅小影。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He talked to her in a familiar, paternal tone, a little disdainful, after the manner of men having girls in their employ, calling her"my dear child,"from the height of his social position, of his undisputed honor. He reached the vital part of the question at once: "Then you prefer to leave us here, exposed to the violences which follow a defeat, rather than consent to a favor which you have so often given in your life?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他对她说话的音调是亲切的，有长辈意味的，略略带点轻蔑的，正是爱摆架子的人对“姑娘们”说话所用的，他叫她做“我的好孩子”，用自己的社会地位低头和她谈判，用自己的不可争的名望和她谈判，他立刻透入了问题的中心：“所以，这样一种献殷勤的事情原是您在生活当中常常遇见的，而您现在不愿接受，反而宁愿让我们留在这儿，难道想教我们也像您自己一样，来冒犯一切可以跟着普鲁士人的溃败而起的暴烈行动？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then he tried to reach her through gentleness, reason, and then the sentiments. He knew how to remain "The Count,"even while showing himself gallant or complimentary, or very amiable if it became necessary. He exalted the service that she would render them, and spoke of her appreciation; then suddenly became gaily familiar, and said: "And you know, my dear, it would be something for him to boast of that he had known a pretty girl; something it is difficult to find in his country."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他用雍容的气概，用理论上的推敲，用情感去争取她的信心。他知道保持“伯爵先生”的身分，一面在必要的时候却显出自己是讨欢心的，会颂扬的，总而言之和蔼可亲的。他热烈地称赞她可以替他们去尽的力，表示他们对她的感戴，随后他突然快快活活用“你”字称呼对她说话：“你知道，我的亲爱的，那个普鲁士人将来可以夸口说自己尝着了一个漂亮姑娘，在他的国家里那真是不大找得着的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At the end of a quarter of an hour he began the same farce again, renewing it occasionally during the whole afternoon. And he pretended to call some one in the story above, giving him advice in a double meaning, drawn from the fountain-head-the mind of a commercial traveler. For some moments he would assume a sad air, breathing in a whisper:"Poor girl!"Then he would murmur between his teeth, with an appearance of rage:"Ugh! That scamp of a Prussian. "Sometimes, at a moment when no more was thought about it, he would say, in an affected voice, many times over:"Enough! enough!"and add, as if speaking to himself,"If we could only see her again, it isn't necessary that he should kill her, the wretch!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过了一刻钟光景，他又做着相同的滑稽样子，而且后来做了又做，他装模作样质问楼上的一个人，同时给了他好些双关意味的劝告。好些从掮客头脑当中想出来的双关意味的劝告。有时候，他做出一阵发愁的样子来叹着气说：“可怜的女孩子。”或者用一阵很生气的样子在牙缝当中含含糊糊地说，“普鲁士光棍，你走！”有时候人都不再去想这件事，他就用一道颤抖的声音接连好些次说道：“够了！够了！”末后他如同自言自语似的，“只须我们还可以和她再见，什么也成，所以指望这个无耻的家伙不把她置之死地！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Suddenly Loiseau, with anxious face and hand up-raised, called out:"Silence!"Everybody was silent, surprised, already frightened.
