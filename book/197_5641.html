<div class="line_en">Summer was creeping over the grounds around the castle; sky and lake alike turned periwinkle blue and flowers large as cabbages burst into bloom in the greenhouses. But with no Hagrid visible from the castle windows, striding the grounds with Fang at his heels, the scene didn't look right to Harry; no better, in fact, than the inside of the castle, where things were so horribly wrong.</div>

<div class="line_en">With Dumbledore gone, fear had spread as never before, so that the sun warming the castle walls outside seemed to stop at the mullioned windows. There was barely a face to be seen in the school that didn't look worried and tense, and any laughter that rang through the corridors sounded shrill and unnatural and was quickly stifled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓布利多走了，恐惧以前所未有的形式迅速蔓延，因此，温暖着城堡外墙的太阳似乎不能照进装着直棂的窗户。学校里的每一张面孔都显得惶恐不安，走廊里响起的每一声大笑都显得刺耳、怪异，并且很快就被压抑住了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Hagrid's hint about the spiders was far easier to understand -- the trouble was, there didn't seem to be a single spider left in the castle to follow. Harry looked everywhere he went, helped (rather reluctantly) by Ron. They were hampered, of course, by the fact that they weren't allowed to wander off on their own but had to move around the castle in a pack with the other Gryffindors. Most of their fellow students seemed glad that they were being shepherded from class to class by teachers, but Harry found it very irksome.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="海格关于蜘蛛的暗示倒是很容易理解——问题是，城堡里似乎没有一只蜘蛛可以让他们跟踪。哈利走到哪里找到哪里，罗恩也（很不情愿地）帮他寻找。当然啦，由于他们不得擅自乱逛，而必须和其他格兰芬多学生成群结队地在城堡里活动，他们的搜寻工作受到了很大阻碍。那些同学似乎很高兴有老师护送他们从一个教室到另一个教室，但哈利觉得非常厌烦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I always thought Father might be the one who got rid of Dumbledore," he said, not troubling to keep his voice down.

McGonagall won't last long, she's only filling in…"</div>

<div class="line_en">One person, however, seemed to be thoroughly enjoying the atmosphere of terror and suspicion. Draco Malfoy was strutting around the school as though he had just been appointed Head Boy. Harry didn't realize what he was so pleased about until the Potions lesson about two weeks after Dumbledore and Hagrid had left, when, sitting right behind Malfoy, Harry overheard him gloating to Crabbe and Goyle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，有一个人似乎特别喜欢这种惊恐和疑惧的气氛。德拉科马尔福神气活现地在学校里走来走去，就好像他刚刚被任命为男生学生会主席一般。哈利一直不明白他为什么这样得意。最后，在邓布利多和海格走了大约两星期后的魔药课上，哈利正好坐在马尔福后面，无意中听到了他得意洋洋地对克拉布和高尔的吹嘘。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"C'mon, Fang, we're going for a walk," said Harry, patting his leg, and Fang bounded happily out of the house behind them, dashed to the edge of the forest, and lifted his leg against a large sycamore tree.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“来吧，牙牙，我们出去散散步。”哈利说着，拍了拍它的后腿。牙牙高兴地跟在他们后面出了小屋，朝树林边缘跑去，并在一棵大西克莫无花果树旁翘起一条腿来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Good thinking," said Ron. "I'd light mine, too, but you know -- it'd probably blow up or something…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好主意，”罗恩说，“我也想让我的魔杖发亮，可是你知道，弄得不好它会爆炸的…”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，”罗恩叹了口气，似乎只好迎接最坏的命运了，“我准备好了。我们走吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry tapped Ron on the shoulder, pointing at the grass. Two solitary spiders were hurrying away from the wandlight into the shade of the trees.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利拍了拍罗恩的肩膀，指着草地上。两只孤独的蜘蛛正匆匆逃离魔杖的光亮，钻进阴暗的树影。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So, with Fang scampering around them, sniffing tree roots and leaves, they entered the forest. By the glow of Harry's wand, they followed the steady trickle of spiders moving along the path. They walked behind them for about twenty minutes, not speaking, listening hard for noises other than breaking twigs and rustling leaves. Then, when the trees had become thicker than ever, so that the stars overhead were no longer visible, and Harry's wand shone alone in the sea of dark, they saw their spider guides leaving the path.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，他们进入了树林，牙牙奔跑在他们周围，一路嗅着树根和树叶。就着哈利魔杖的光亮，他们跟随着持续不断地在小路上爬行的蜘蛛。走了大约有二十分钟，谁也没有说话，只侧耳细听着除了树枝折断声和树叶沙沙声之外，还有没有别的声音。然后，树木越发茂密了，头顶上的星星也看不见了。哈利的魔杖孤零零地在一片无边无际的漆黑中闪着微光，这时他们发现那些蜘蛛向导偏离了小路。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry took out his wand, murmured, "Lumos!" and a tiny light appeared at the end of it, just enough to let them watch the path for signs of spiders.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利拿出魔杖，喃喃地说：“荧光闪烁！”于是魔杖头上放出一束细光，刚好够他们观察道路上有没有蜘蛛的影子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So they followed the darting shadows of the spiders into the trees. They couldn't move very quickly now; there were tree roots and stumps in their way, barely visible in the near blackness. Harry could feel Fang's hot breath on his hand. More than once, they had to stop, so that Harry could crouch down and find the spiders in the wandlight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，他们跟着蜘蛛飞奔的影子进入树丛。他们现在无法走得很快了，到处都是树根和树桩，挡住了道路，在近乎漆黑一片的光线下简直看不出来。哈利可以感觉到牙牙热乎乎的呼吸喷在他手上。他们不止一次被迫停住脚步，哈利蹲下去，就着魔杖的光寻找蜘蛛的踪迹。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry paused, trying to see where the spiders were going, but everything outside his little sphere of light was pitch-black. He had never been this deep into the forest before. He could vividly remember Hagrid advising him not to leave the forest path last time he'd been in here. But Hagrid was miles away now, probably sitting in a cell in Azkaban, and he had also said to follow the spiders.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利停住脚步，想看清楚蜘蛛移动的方向，但是在被那点微光照亮的范围之外，是伸手不见五指的黑暗。他以前从未这样深入树林中央。他清晰地回忆起他上次进入林子时，海格曾告诫他不要偏离林间小路。但是海格此刻在千里迢迢之外，大概正坐在阿兹卡班的囚室里，而且他也说过要跟着蜘蛛走。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Something wet touched Harry's hand and he jumped backward, crushing Ron's foot, but it was only Fang's nose.</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry didn't even have time to turn around. There was a loud clicking noise and suddenly he felt something long and hairy seize him around the middle and lift him off the ground, so that he was hanging facedown.

<div class="line_cn" title="哈利甚至还没来得及转身。只听见一阵响亮的咔哒咔哒声，他突然觉得一个长长的、毛茸茸的东西把他拦腰抄起，使他脸朝下悬在半空。他挣扎着，极度惊恐，这时又听见了咔哒咔哒声，他看见罗恩的双腿也离开了地面，还听见牙牙在哀鸣、咆哮——接着，它就被拖进了漆黑的树丛。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He never knew how long he was in the creature's clutches; he only knew that the darkness suddenly lifted enough for him to see that the leaf-strewn ground was now swarming with spiders.

<div class="line_en">Harry fell to the ground on all fours as the spider released him. Ron and Fang thudded down next to him. Fang wasn't howling anymore, but cowering silently on the spot.

<div class="line_en">The car stopped so suddenly that they were nearly thrown into the windshield. They had reached the edge of the forest. Fang flung himself at the window in his anxiety to get out, and when Harry opened the door, he shot off through the trees to Hagrid's house, tail between his legs. Harry got out too, and after a minute or so, Ron seemed to regain the feeling in his limbs and followed, still stiff-necked and staring. Harry gave the car a grateful pat as it reversed back into the forest and disappeared from view.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汽车停下了，停得太突然了，由于惯性，他们差点撞在挡风玻璃上。他们已经来到了树林边缘。牙牙扑向车窗，迫不及待地想出来，哈利一打开车门，它就箭一般地穿过树丛，夹着尾巴，向海格的小屋奔去。哈利也下了车，过了大约一分钟，罗恩似乎恢复了四肢的感觉，也跟着下来了，但他的脖子仍然僵硬，眼睛也直勾勾的。哈利感激地拍了拍汽车，它掉头返回树林，消失不见了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Get Fang!" Harry yelled, diving into the front seat; Ron seized the boarhound around the middle and threw him, yelping, into the back of the car -- the doors slammed shut -- Ron didn't touch the accelerator but the car didn't need him; the engine roared and they were off, hitting more spiders. They sped up the slope, out of the hollow, and they were soon crashing through the forest, branches whipping the windows as the car wound its way cleverly through the widest gaps, following a path it obviously knew.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“带上牙牙！”哈利喊道，一边钻进前座。罗恩拦腰抓住大猎狗，把狂吠的它扔到后座上。车门砰地关上了。罗恩没有碰油门，但汽车并不需要他做什么，发动机轰响起来，他们出发了，又撞倒了更多的蜘蛛。他们飞快地驰上斜坡，离开了凹地。很快，他们在树林里横冲直撞地穿行。汽车沿着一条它显然很熟悉的路线，机灵地左拐右拐，寻找最宽的豁口。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As the castle loomed nearer Harry twitched the cloak to make sure their feet were hidden, then pushed the creaking front doors ajar. They walked carefully back across the entrance hall and up the marble staircase, holding their breath as they passed corridors where watchful sentries were walking. At last they reached the safety of the Gryffindor common room, where the fire had burned itself into glowing ash. They took off the cloak and climbed the winding stair to their dormitory.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="城堡越来越近了，哈利使劲拉了拉隐形衣，以确保四只脚都被隐蔽了，然后把吱呀作响的前门推开一道缝。他们小心地走过门厅，走上大理石台阶，屏住呼吸，穿过有哨兵巡视的走廊。终于，他们平安回到了格兰芬多公共休息室，那里的炉火已经燃尽，只剩下余烬在闪着微光。他们脱下隐形衣，爬上旋转楼梯，回到宿舍。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The creature that was lurking somewhere in the castle, he thought, sounded like a sort of monster Voldemort -- even other monsters didn't want to name it.
