The other, the one that took the lash from Thread, throbs painfully. Gale's dead to the world, but his fingers are locked around mine.

<div class="line_en">I feel my way up the stairs, crawl under the covers, and fall asleep at once. At some point, Clove, the girl from District 2, enters my dreams. She chases me, pins me to the ground, and pulls out a knife to cut my face. It digs deeply into my cheek, opening a wide gash. Then Clove begins to transform, her face elongating into a snout, dark fur sprouting from her skin, her fingernails growing into long claws, but her eyes remain unchanged. She becomes the muttation form of herself, the wolflike creation of the Capitol that terrorized us the last night in the arena. Tossing back her head, she lets out a long, eerie howl that is picked up by other mutts nearby. Clove begins to lap the blood flowing from my wound, each lick sending a new wave of pain through my face. I give a strangled cry and wake with a start, sweating and shivering at once.</div>

A few days to think. To work out a plan. With Gale and Peeta and Haymitch all at hand. This blizzard is a gift.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我喜欢这狂风暴雪，它夹带着猛烈的狂风，裹挟着随风炫舞的大雪。这雪可以把真正的豺狼隔绝在外，也可以阻挡治安警的到来。还有几天的时间，可以用来思考，做出计划。这暴风雪是上苍赐予的礼物。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Before I go down to face this new life, though, I take some time making myself acknowledge what it will mean. Less than a day ago, I was prepared to head into the wilderness with my loved ones in midwinter, with the very real possibility of the Capitol pursuing us. A precarious venture at best. But now I am committing to something even more risky. Fighting the Capitol assures their swift retaliation. I must accept that at any moment I can be arrested. There will be a knock on the door, like the one last night, a band of Peacekeepers to haul me away. There might be torture. Mutilation. A bullet through my skull in the town square, if I'm fortunate enough to go that quickly. The Capitol has no end of creative ways to kill people. I imagine these things and I'm terrified, but let's face it: They've been lurking in the back of my brain, anyway. I've been a tribute in the Games. Been threatened by the president. Taken a lash across my face. I'm already a target.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但在投入到这种新生活之前，我要花时间考虑清楚这究竞是怎样的一种生活。不到一天以前，我还在考虑与自己所关爱的人一起在深冬逃到林子里去，后有凯匹特不断的追捕。这充其量不过是一种冒险，但现在，我要迎接更大的危险。与凯匹特对抗会立刻招致对方猛烈的反扑，我必须随时准备遭到逮捕，像昨晚一样随时可能有人敲门，我会被一队治安警拉走，我会被折磨，被毁誉，会被拉到广场，在头上挨上一枪——如果这惩罚来得足够快的话。凯匹特有无数杀人的新方法，我想到了这一切，我感到恐惧，但我要面对：事实上，我已经遭受过来自身后的威胁，我不曾是饥饿游戏的“贡品”吗？不是已经遭到总统的威胁吗？不是已经在脸上遭到了鞭打吗？我早已成了他们戕害的目标。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The swelling around my eye has gone down and I can open it a bit. I push aside the curtains and see the snowstorm has strengthened to a full-out blizzard. There's nothing but whiteness and the howling wind that sounds remarkably like the muttations.</div>

And even that pales in comparison with Rue's life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我忽然意识到，实际上她已经受到伤害。她的爸爸已死在肮脏的井下，她在快要饿死时，被弃之不顾，她被选做了“贡品”，她眼睁睁地看着自己的姐姐在饥饿游戏中为生存去搏杀。对于只有十二岁的她，遭到的伤害比我大得多。可与露露受到的伤害相比，却又轻微得多了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Yes. This is the thing to remember when fear threatens to swallow me up. What I am about to do, whatever any of us are forced to endure, it is for them.

Not too late for Prim.</div>

<div class="line_en">Gale is right. If people have the courage, this could be an opportunity. He's also right that, since I have set it in motion, I could do so much. Although I have no idea what exactly that should be. But deciding not to run away is a crucial first step.</div>

<div class="line_en">I take a shower, and this morning my brain is not assembling lists of supplies for the wild, but trying to figure out how they organized that uprising in District 8. So many, so clearly acting in defiance of the Capitol. Was it even planned, or something that simply erupted out of years of hatred and resentment? How could we do that here? Would the people of District 12 join in or lock their doors? Yesterday the square emptied so quickly after Gale's whipping. But isn't that because we all feel so impotent and have no idea what to do? We need someone to direct us and reassure us this is possible. And I don't think I'm that person. I may have been a catalyst for rebellion, but a leader should be someone with conviction, and I'm barely a convert myself. Someone with unflinching courage, and I'm still working hard at even finding mine. Someone with clear and persuasive words, and I'm so easily tongue-tied.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我洗了个澡，今天早晨，我第一次不再为野外逃奔的给养列清单，我在想八区是怎样组织起暴动的？很多人很明确地蔑视和反抗凯匹特。是有计划的吗？还是多年仇恨与不满的积聚和爆发？我们在十二区该怎么办？十二区的人会加入到我们的行列还是会大门紧锁？昨天在盖尔遭受鞭刑之后，人群散得那么快。但，这不也是因为我们感觉自己软弱无力，不知该如何是好的缘故吗？我们需要有人给予我们指导，告诉我们自己能做到。我觉得我无法成为这个人，我只是暴动的催化剂，但一位领袖应该具有坚定的信心、非凡的勇气、清晰的思维、出色的说服力，而我却没有足够的信心，常在寻找勇气的边缘徘徊，也没有很好的口才。">查看中文翻译</div>

During this time I help tend to Gale, apply snow coat to my cheek, try to remember everything I can about the uprising in District 8, in case it will help us. The swelling in my face goes down, leaving me with an itchy, healing wound and a very black eye. But still, the first chance I get, I call Peeta to see if he wants to go into town with me.</div>

<div class="line_en">We rouse Haymitch and drag him along with us. He complains, but not as much as usual. We all know we need to discuss what happened and it can't be anywhere as dangerous as our homes in the Victor's Village. In fact, we wait until the village is well behind us to even speak. I spend the time studying the ten-foot walls of snow piled up on either side of the narrow path that has been cleared, wondering if they will collapse in on us.</div>

An uprising requires breaking the law, thwarting authority. We've done that our whole lives, or our families have. Poaching, trading on the black market, mocking the Capitol in the woods. But for most people in District 12, a trip to buy something at the Hob would be too risky. And I expect them to assemble in the square with bricks and torches?

Waterproof boots, a snowsuit that covers me from head to toe, thermal gloves. I love my old hunting stuff, but the trek I have in mind today is more suited to this high-tech clothing. I tiptoe downstairs, load my game bag with food, and sneak out of the house. Slinking along side streets and back alleys, I make my way to the weak spot in the fence closest to Rooba the butcher's. Since many workers cross this way to get to the mines, the snow's pockmarked with footprints. Mine will not be noticed.

I am literally a few yards from the door of the cement house when I pull up short. And that's not because of the smoke or the prints or the smell. That's because of the unmistakable click of a weapon behind me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="走到那里用了两倍于平常的时间。西纳设计的衣服很挡寒，我走到时，身上已被汗水浸湿了，可脸却冻得发木。冬日的阳光照在雪地上，使我视线模糊，加之我身体极度疲劳，内心十分失望，所以我没有注意到周围的变化——烟囱里冒出的袅袅青烟、地上的新脚印和烧松针的味道。我走到离水泥房子只有几码远的地方却突然停住了脚步，不是因为烟雾、脚印或烧松针的味道，而是我清楚地听到身后咔嗒一声子弹上膛的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Second nature. Instinct. I turn, drawing back the arrow, although I know already that the odds are not in my favor. I see the white Peacekeeper uniform, the pointed chin, the light brown iris where my arrow will find a home. But the weapon is dropping to the ground and the unarmed woman is holding something out to me in her gloved hand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凭着我的第六感，我本能地急速转身，拉满弓，内心很清楚目前处境对自己不利。我看到一个身穿白色制服、尖下巴的女人正站在我身后，她浅棕色的眼睛正是我弓箭要瞄准的位置。一瞬间她的枪从手中滑落到地上，她正伸出另一只戴着手套的手把一件东西递给我。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I waver, unable to process this turn in events. Perhaps they have orders to bring me in alive so they can torture me into incriminating every person I ever knew. Yeah, good luck with that, I think. My fingers have all but decided to release the arrow when I see the object in the glove. It's a small white circle of flat bread. More of a cracker, really. Gray and soggy around the edges. But an image is clearly stamped in the center of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我一时不知所措，对眼前发生的一切未能及时反应过来。也许他们得到命令要将我活着带回去，之后折磨我，直到我把自己认识的每一个人都加上莫须有的罪名。好吧，运气不错。我思忖着。箭在弦上，就在我要把箭射出的刹那，我看到了她手里捧着的东西。那是一个小白扁面包圈，其实更像一块饼干，边缘已经有些潮湿了，颜色比别处也更深些。但饼干的中间位置却清晰地印着一个图案。">查看中文翻译</div>
