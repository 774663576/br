<div class="line_en">Dad said that the Government had programmed the computers with a six-digit calendar, which meant the year had only two digits. "When nine-nine becomes oh-oh," he said, "the computers won't know what year it is. They'll shut down."</div>

<div class="line_en">At church, Dad warned everyone about Y2K. He advised Papa Jay to get strong locks for his gas station, and maybe some defensive weaponry. "That store will be the first thing looted in the famine," Dad said. He told Brother Mumford that every righteous man should have, at minimum, a ten-year supply of food, fuel, guns and gold. Brother Mumford just whistled. "We can't all be as righteous as you, Gene," he said. "Some of us are sinners!" No one listened. They went about their lives in the summer sun.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在教堂，爸爸提醒大家提防千年虫。他建议杰伊老爹为他的加油站买些结实的锁，也许该弄些防御武器。“大饥荒来了，商店将是被洗劫的首要目标。”爸爸说。他告诉芒福德教友，每一个正直之士应该至少储备供十年使用的食物、燃料、枪支和黄金。芒福德教友只是吹了吹口哨。“我们不可能都像你一样正直，吉恩，”他说，“我们中有些人是罪人！”没有人听他的话。他们在夏日艳阳底下照常生活。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One afternoon, Dad climbed into the excavator and dug a pit next to the old barn. Then, using the loader, he lowered a thousand-gallon tank into the pit and buried it with a shovel, carefully planting nettles and sow thistle in the freshly tossed dirt so they would grow and conceal the tank. He whistled "I Feel Pretty" from West Side Story while he shoveled. His hat was tipped back on his head, and he wore a brilliant smile. "We'll be the only ones with fuel when The End comes," he said. "We'll be driving when everyone else is hotfooting it. We'll even make a run down to Utah, to fetch Tyler."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天下午，爸爸爬进挖掘机，在旧谷仓旁挖了一个坑。接着他用装载机把一千加仑的油罐放进坑里，用铁锹填埋好，在新鲜的泥土上精心种上荨麻，撒上蓟种子，这样它们长出来就能遮蔽油罐。拿着铁锹掩埋时，他吹着《西区故事》里《我感觉真好》的调子。他帽檐向脑后倾斜，一脸灿烂的微笑。“末日来了，我们将是唯一有燃料的人，”他说，“其他所有人靠双脚奔逃的时候，我们还能开车。我们甚至能开到犹他州去接泰勒。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Meanwhile, my family boiled and skinned peaches, pitted apricots and churned apples into sauce.

<div class="line_en">The interactions between people at Worm Creek were not at all what I was used to in my family. Of course I'd spent time with people outside my family, but they were like us: women who'd hired Mother to midwife their babies, or who came to her for herbs because they didn't believe in the Medical Establishment. I had a single friend, named Jessica. A few years before, Dad had convinced her parents, Rob and Diane, that public schools were little more than Government propaganda programs, and since then they had kept her at home. Before her parents had pulled Jessica from school, she was one of them, and I never tried to talk to her; but after, she was one of us. The normal kids stopped including her, and she was left with me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虫溪剧场里人们的交流方式与我们家全然不同。当然，我也和家人以外的人来往，但那些人和我们一样：要么是雇母亲接生的女人，要么是不相信医疗机构来找她买草药的女人。我只有一个朋友，叫杰西卡。几年前，爸爸说服她的父母罗伯和黛安，说公立学校只不过是政府的宣传项目。从此以后，他们也把她留在家里。杰西卡的父母把她从学校拽走之前，她还是“他们”中的一员，我从未和她说过话；但后来她成了“我们”中的一员。正常的孩子不再要她了，她被留给了我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I'd never learned how to talk to people who weren't like us -- people who went to school and visited the doctor. Who weren't preparing, every day, for the End of the World. Worm Creek was full of these people, people whose words seemed ripped from another reality. That was how it felt the first time the director spoke to me, like he was speaking from another dimension. All he said was, "Go find FDR." I didn't move.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我从没学过如何跟与我们不一样的人，与那些去上学、去看医生，不为世界末日来临天天备战的人交谈。虫溪剧场里都是这样的人，他们的话仿佛脱胎于另一种现实。导演第一次和我说话时我就是这种感觉，就好像他来自异次元世界。他只说了一句话：“去找找FDR的资料。”我没有反应。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We drove to my aunt Angie's and parked in front of the white picket fence she shared with Grandma. Mother knocked, then stood back from the door and smoothed her hair. Angie looked surprised to see us -- Mother rarely visited her sister -- but she smiled warmly and invited us in. Her front room reminded me of fancy hotel lobbies from the movies, there was so much silk and lace. Mother and I sat on a pleated sofa of pale pink while Mother explained why we'd come. Angie said her daughter had a few dresses that might do.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mother waited on the pink sofa while Angie led me upstairs to her daughter's room and laid out an armful of dresses, each so fine, with such intricate lace patterns and delicately tied bows, that at first I was afraid to touch them. Angie helped me into each one, knotting the sashes, fastening the buttons, plumping the bows. "You should take this one," she said, passing me a navy dress with white braided cords arranged across the bodice. "Grandma sewed this detailing." I took the dress, along with another made of red velvet collared with white lace, and Mother and I drove home.</div>

<div class="line_en">When the director of the next play got divorced, it confirmed Dad's suspicions. He said he hadn't kept me out of the public school for all these years just to see me corrupted on a stage. Then he drove me to the rehearsal. Nearly every night he said he was going to put a stop to my going, that one evening he'd just show up at Worm Creek and haul me home. But each time a play opened he was there, in the front row.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="下一部剧的导演离婚的时候，爸爸的怀疑得到了证实。他说这些年来他没送我去公立学校读书，可不是为了看我在舞台上堕落。之后排练都是他亲自开车送我去。几乎每晚他都说以后不会再让我去了，说他迟早会在哪天晚上去虫溪剧场把我拖回家。但每次演出一开始他就来了，坐在第一排。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The play opened a week later. Dad was in the front row. When the performance ended, he marched right to the box office and bought tickets for the next night. It was all he talked about that Sunday in church. Not doctors, or the Illuminati, or Y2K. Just the play over in town, where his youngest daughter was singing the lead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这出剧一星期后开演。爸爸坐在前排。演出结束后，他径直走到售票处，又买了第二天晚上的票。那个星期天他在教堂没有谈论别的。不再谈论医生或光明会，也不再提什么千年虫，只谈论镇上上演的那出戏剧，他的小女儿在里面担任主唱。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dad didn't stop me from auditioning for the next play, or the one after that, even though he worried about me spending so much time away from home.

<div class="line_en">Sometimes he played the part of an agent or manager, correcting my technique or suggesting songs for my repertoire, even advising me about my health. That winter I caught a procession of sore throats and couldn't sing, and one night Dad called me to him and pried my mouth open to look at my tonsils.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有时他扮演经纪人或经理的角色，纠正我的演唱技巧，为我推荐曲目，甚至为我的健康出谋划策。那年冬天，我的嗓子持续疼痛，无法唱歌。一天晚上，爸爸把我叫到跟前，撬开我的嘴，查看我的扁桃体。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"They're swollen, all right," he said. "Big as apricots." When Mother couldn't get the swelling down with echinacea and calendula, Dad suggested his own remedy. "People don't know it, but the sun is the most powerful medicine we have. That's why people don't get sore throats in summer." He nodded, as if approving of his own logic, then said, "If I had tonsils like yours, I'd go outside every morning and stand in the sun with my mouth open -- let those rays seep in for a half hour or so. They'll shrink in no time." He called it a treatment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“它们都肿了，好吧，”他说，“肿得跟杏子似的。”母亲用紫锥菊和金盏花也没能让它们消肿，爸爸便提出了自己的疗法：“人们不知道，其实太阳才是最强大的药物。夏天人们不会喉咙痛就是这个原因。”他点了点头，仿佛对自己的逻辑深表赞同，然后说，“如果我的扁桃体像你这样，我就会每天早上出门站在太阳底下，张开嘴巴，晒上半小时左右。它们很快就会消肿。”他称之为“治疗”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was uncomfortable, standing with my jaw dropped and my head tilted back so the sun could shine into my throat. I never lasted a whole half hour.

Then one night, when I was wandering alone in the dark wings backstage, I turned a corner and found him sitting on the wooden crate that was a favorite haunt of mine. The crate was isolated -- that was why I liked it.</div>

Richard was so excited he was hopping from one foot to the other, reciting what it could do. "Got a range more than a mile! Can bring down a helicopter!"</div>

<div class="line_en">The meatloaf was forgotten. We charged outside. It was past sunset; the horizon was dark.

I had both palms pressed to my ears, but after the initial boom I dropped them, listening as the shot echoed through the ravines.

<div class="line_en">"Maybe," I said, and he smiled. A few of his friends stepped into the wing and called to him. He stood and said goodbye, and I watched him join them, taking in the easy way they joked together and imagining an alternate reality in which I was one of them. I imagined Charles inviting me to his house, to play a game or watch a movie, and felt a rush of pleasure. But when I pictured Charles visiting Buck's Peak, I felt something else, something like panic. What if he found the root cellar? What if he discovered the fuel tank? Then I understood, finally, what the rifle was for. That mighty barrel, with its special range that could reach from the mountain to the valley, was a defensive perimeter for the house, for our supplies, because Dad said we would be driving when everyone else was hotfooting it. We would have food, too, when everyone else was starving, looting. Again I imagined Charles climbing the hill to our house. But in my imagination I was on the ridge, and I was watching his approach through crosshairs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“也许吧。”我说，他笑了。他的几个朋友走到舞台这一侧喊他。他站起来跟我道别，我看着他加入他们，与他们一起轻松地说笑，想象着在另一个平行现实中我成了他们中的一员。我想象查尔斯邀请我去他家，邀请我去玩游戏或看电影，感到一阵心驰神往。但当我想象查尔斯来巴克峰做客的时候，我感到了另一种东西，类似于恐慌。如果他发现了地窖怎么办？如果他发现了油箱怎么办？接着我终于明白了那支步枪的用途。那支特殊的、射程覆盖山到山谷的巨大枪管，是保卫我们的房子和补给品的防御工事，因为爸爸说过在其他人只能靠双脚奔逃的时候，我们将能开车。其他人都在挨饿、抢劫的时候，我们还会有食物。我又一次想象查尔斯爬上山来到我们家。但在我的想象中，我在山脊上，正通过十字瞄准镜，望着他一步步走过来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After dinner, Dad studied Isaiah for hours. At around ten he closed his Bible and turned on the TV. The television was new. Aunt Angie's husband worked for a satellite-TV company, and he'd offered Dad a deal on a subscription. No one had believed it when Dad said yes, but in retrospect it was entirely characteristic for my father to move, in the space of a day, from no TV or radio to full-blown cable. I sometimes wondered if Dad allowed the television that year, specifically, because he knew it would all disappear on January 1. Perhaps he did it to give us a little taste of the world, before it was swept away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="晚饭后，爸爸研读了几个小时的《以赛亚书》。十点左右，他合上《圣经》，打开电视。电视是新的。安琪姨妈的丈夫在一家卫星电视公司工作，他让爸爸订阅他们的节目。不敢相信爸爸竟然答应了。回想起来，这完全是爸爸的风格。在一天之内，原本没有电视和收音机的家里一下子装上了全套的有线电视。我有时会想，爸爸破例同意在那一年安装电视，是否因为他知道在一月一日，一切都将消失。也许他这么做是为了在一切被吞没之前，让我们领略一番这个世界。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Before Christmas, we continued our preparations as if every action, every minor addition to our stores might make the difference between surviving, and not; after Christmas, we waited. "When the hour of need arises," Dad said, "the time of preparation has passed."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="圣诞节前，我们继续做准备工作，好像每一步行动、每一点储备物资的增添，都可能攸关生死。圣诞节后，我们等待着。“当需要的时刻到来，”爸爸说，“准备的时刻就过去了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Christmas was sparse that year. We weren't poor -- Mother's business was doing well and Dad was still scrapping -- but we'd spent everything on supplies.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那年的圣诞节我们没怎么过。我们并不贫穷——母亲的生意做得很好，爸爸还在捡收废品——但我们把所有钱都花在了补给品上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The days dragged on, and then it was December 31. Dad was calm at breakfast but under his tranquillity I sensed excitement, and something like longing. He'd been waiting for so many years, burying guns and stockpiling food and warning others to do the same. Everyone at church had read the prophecies; they knew the Days of Abomination were coming. But still they'd teased Dad, they'd laughed at him. Tonight he would be vindicated.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="日子一天天过去，转眼到了十二月三十一日。早餐时爸爸很平静，但在他的宁静中我感受到兴奋与类似渴望的东西。他等了这么多年，埋藏枪支，囤积食物，还告诫别人也这么做。教堂里的每个人都读过预言书，他们知道世界末日将要到来。尽管如此，他们还是对爸爸冷嘲热讽。今晚将证明他是正确的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dad's favorite program was The Honeymooners, and that night there was a special, with episodes playing back to back. We watched, waiting for The End. I checked the clock every few minutes from ten until eleven, then every few seconds until midnight. Even Dad, who was rarely stirred by anything outside himself, glanced often at the clock.</div>
