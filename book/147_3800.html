<div class="line_en">He passed the old one-legged gateman on the station platform very easily, carrying her baggage. Then he sat beside her in the close green heat of the pullman until the train should go. A little electric fan droned uselessly above the aisle; a prim young lady whom he knew, arranged herself amid the bright new leather of her bags. She returned his greeting elegantly, with a shade of refined hauteur, then looked out the window again, grimacing eloquently at her parents who gazed at her raptly from the platform. Several prosperous merchants went down the aisle in expensive tan shoes that creaked under the fan's drone.</div>

I was so blue when I got here, I almost cried. Little Richmond is too ghastly for words -- everything burned up and every one gone away to the mountains or the sea. How can I ever stand it even for a week!" (Good! he thought. If the weather holds, she will come back all the sooner.) "It would be heaven now to get one breath of mountain air. Could you find your way back to our place in the valley again?" (Yes, even if I were blind, he thought.) "Will you promise to look after your hand until it gets well? I worried so after you had gone, because I forgot to change the bandage yesterday. Daddy was glad to see me: he said he was not going to let me go again but, don't worry, I'll have my own way in the end. I always do. I don't know any one at home any more -- all of the boys have enlisted or gone to work in the shipyards at Norfolk. Most of the girls I know are getting married, or married already. That leaves only the kids." (He winced. As old as I am, maybe older.) "Give my love to Mrs. Barton, and tell your mother I said she must not work so hard in that hot kitchen. And all the little cross-marks at the bottom are for you. Try to guess what they are. LAURA."</div>

<div class="line_en">When he had finished the letter, he reread it, slowly and carefully. Then he folded it, put it in his inner breast-pocket, and leaving Dixieland, walked for forty minutes, until he came up in the gap over the town again. It was sunset. The sun's vast rim, blood-red, rested upon the western earth, in a great field of murky pollen. It sank beyond the western ranges. The clear sweet air was washed with gold and pearl. The vast hills melted into purple solitudes: they were like Canaan and rich grapes. The motors of cove people toiled up around the horse-shoe of the road. Dusk came. The bright winking lights in the town went up. Darkness melted over the town like dew: it washed out all the day's distress, the harsh confusions. Low wailing sounds came faintly up from Niggertown.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="读完这封信以后，他又慢慢地、仔仔细细地读了一遍。然后把信折好，装进了贴身的衣服口袋里，然后走出了南都旅馆。他一口气走了40分钟，最后登上小城上面那个居高临下的山峡。现在正是夕阳西沉的时候。一轮血红的太阳搁在西边的大地上，大地上洒满了模糊的微粒。一会儿工夫，夕阳便沉入了西山。清新甜美的空气被夕阳渲染得金黄透亮。广袤的山峦渐渐地融化在紫色的孤寂之中，它们就像迦南的乐土和丰美的葡萄。峡谷地区的居民开着摩托车盘旋在马蹄形的山路上，一路吃力地爬上来。夜幕开始降临。小城里万家灯火闪烁。黑夜像露水一样笼罩了全城，将一天的忧伤和困惑洗得干干净净。从“黑人区”隐约传来阵阵呜咽的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And above him the proud stars flashed into heaven: there was one, so rich and low, that he could have picked it, if he had climbed the hill beyond the Jew's great house. One, like a lamp, hung low above the heads of men returning home. (O Hesperus, you bring us all good things.) One had flashed out the light that winked on him the night that Ruth lay at the feet of Boaz; and one on Queen Isolt; and one on Corinth and on Troy. It was night, vast brooding night, the mother of loneliness, that washes our stains away. He was washed in the great river of night, in the Ganges tides of redemption. His bitter wound was for the moment healed in him: he turned his face upward to the proud and tender stars, which made him a god and a grain of dust, the brother of eternal beauty and the son of death -- alone, alone.</div>

And she, whom he would not touch, lay there, like a sheaf of grain, in the crook of his arm, token of the world's remedy -- the refuge from the one lost face out of all the faces, the anodyne against the wound named Laura -- a thousand flitting shapes of beauty to bring him comfort and delight. The great pageantry of pain and pride and death hung through the dusk its awful vision, touching his sorrow with a lonely joy. He had lost; but all pilgrimage across the world was loss: a moment of cleaving, a moment of taking away, the thousand phantom shapes that beaconed, and the high impassionate grief of stars.</div>

They went together to the hotel roof and danced; later "Pap" Rheinhart, kind and awkward and shy, and smelling of his horse, came to their little table, sitting and drinking with them. He had spent the years since Leonard's at a military school, trying to straighten the wry twist of his neck. But he remained the same as ever -- quizzical, dry, and humorous.

The streets at night were filled with sad lispings: all through the night, upon his porch, as in a coma, he heard the strange noise of autumn. And all the people who had given the town its light thronging gaiety were vanished strangely overnight. They had gone back into the vast South again. The solemn tension of the war gathered about the nation. A twilight of grim effort hovered around him, above him. He felt the death of joy; but the groping within him of wonder, of glory.

<div class="line_en">He walked through the streets at night with Irene Mallard; the town was thinned and saddened by departures. A few people hurried past, as if driven along by the brief pouncing gusts of wind. He was held in the lure of her subtle weariness: she gave him comfort and he never touched her. But he unpacked the burden of his heart, trembling and passionate. She sat beside him and stroked his hand. It seemed to him that he never knew her until he remembered her years later.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="夜暮降临了，他与艾琳·玛拉漫步在街头。由于游人大多已经离去了，所以这个小城变得寂寥而阴沉。三两个行人匆匆走了过去，好像被秋风吹落了一般。他被她那种微妙的倦怠气质深深地吸引住了：她给了他某种安慰，但是他却从来没有碰过她。他只会向她倾诉自己的心里话，这时候他会浑身颤抖、情绪兴奋。她坐在他的身边，抚摸着他的手。直到多年以后，当他再次想起她的时候，他才明白自己一直没有真正了解过她。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He bent his head sharply, and closed his eyes. O My lovely Saint! he thought. How close you have been to me, if any one. How I have cut my brain open for you to see, and would my heart, if I had dared, and how alone I am, and always have been.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他猛地低下头，紧闭双眼。哦，我可爱的圣人啊！他心里想。你曾经和我这么亲近，我宁愿劈开脑子让你来看，愿意把心掏出来给你看呀！我是多么孤独啊，永远都会这样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It does seem you might spend one night at home with your mother," she said querulously. Her eyes grew misty at once, her lips began to work tremulously in a bitter self-pitying smile. "I tell you what! It looks mighty funny, doesn't it? You can't stay with me five minutes any more without wanting to be up and off with the first woman that comes along. It's all right! It's all right. I'm not complaining. It seems as if all I was fit for is to cook and sew and get you ready to go off." She burst volubly into tears. "It seems that that's the only use you have for me. I've hardly laid eyes on you all summer."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你好像连一个晚上都不愿意待在家里和妈妈相处一会儿。”她抱怨着。接着，她的眼睛开始模糊起来。她嘴唇颤抖、自怨自艾地苦笑起来：“你听我说，这一切似乎很可笑，是吗？你跟我在一起连五分钟都待不住。但是，一看见其他女人，马上就会站起来跟她去了。算了，算了，我不怪你。看来我只配给你烧饭缝补衣服、帮你收拾行李上路。”她的眼泪开始簌簌地落了下来。“看起来这是你唯一用得着我的地方了。整个夏天，我几乎连你的影子都见不到。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No," he said bitterly, "you've been too busy looking after the boarders. Don't think, mama, that you can work on my feelings here at the last minute," he cried, already deeply worked-on. "It's easy to cry. But I was here all the time if you had had time for me. Oh, for God's sake! Let's make an end to this! Aren't things bad enough without it? Why must you act this way whenever I go off? Do you want to make me as miserable as you can?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, I tell you," said Eliza hopefully, becoming dry-eyed at once, "if I make a couple of deals and everything goes well, you may find me waiting for you in a big fine house when you come back next Spring. I've got the lot picked out. I was thinking about it the other day," she went on, giving him a bright and knowing nod.</div>

Take care of your money -- I want you to have plenty of good food and warm clothes -- but you mustn't be extravagant, boy. This sickness of your papa's has cost a lot of money. Everything is going out and nothing's coming in. Nobody knows where the next dollar's coming from. So you've got to watch out."</div>
