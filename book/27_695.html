<div class="line_en">She hated the artist's illustration. He had made her head huge and given her a vacuous, doe-eyed grin that screamed blond bimbo. Other than that, there wasn't much to dislike about the article. It took up most of a page in the front section of the Wall Street Journal and hit all the right notes. Drawing blood the traditional way with a needle in the arm was likened to vampirism, or as the writer put it more elegantly, "medicine by Bram Stoker." Theranos's processes, by contrast, were described as requiring "only microscopic blood volumes" and as "faster, cheaper and more accurate than the conventional methods." The brilliant young Stanford dropout behind the breakthrough invention was anointed "the next Steve Jobs or Bill Gates" by no less than former secretary of state George Shultz, the man many credited with winning the Cold War, in a quote at the end of the article.</div>

<div class="line_en">Elizabeth had engineered the piece, which was published in the Saturday, September 7, 2013, edition of the Journal, to coincide with the commercial launch of Theranos's blood-testing services. A press release was due to go out first thing Monday morning announcing the opening of the first Theranos wellness center in a Walgreens store in Palo Alto and plans for a subsequent nationwide expansion of the partnership. For a heretofore unknown startup, coverage this flattering in one of the country's most prominent and respected publications was a major coup. What had made it possible was Elizabeth's close relationship with Shultz -- a connection she'd made two years earlier and carefully cultivated.</div>

<div class="line_en">During a visit to the paper's Midtown Manhattan headquarters to discuss climate change with its editorial board in 2012, Shultz had dropped mention of a secretive and reclusive Silicon Valley startup founder who he felt certain was going to revolutionize medicine with her technology. Intrigued, the Journal's long-serving editorial page editor, Paul Gigot, had offered to send one of his writers to interview the mysterious wunderkind when she felt ready to break her silence and introduce her invention to the world.</div>

<div class="line_en">The former statesman, who in addition to crafting the Reagan administration's foreign policy also served as secretary of labor and secretary of the treasury under President Nixon, had joined the Theranos board of directors in July 2011 and become one of Elizabeth's biggest champions. A distinguished fellow at the Hoover Institution, the think tank housed on the Stanford campus, Shultz remained a revered and influential figure in Republican circles despite his advancing age (he was ninety-two).

<div class="line_en">Elizabeth had picked a safe place for her coming-out party. The Weekend Interview, which rotated among the members of Gigot's staff, wasn't meant to be hard-hitting investigative journalism. Rather, it was what its name implied: an interview whose tone was usually friendly and nonconfrontational. Moreover, her message of bringing disruption to an old and inefficient industry was bound to play well with the Journal editorial page's pro-business, anti-regulation ethos. Nor did Rago, who had won a Pulitzer Prize for tough editorials dissecting Obamacare, have any reason to suspect that what Elizabeth was telling him wasn't true. During his visit to Palo Alto, she had shown him the miniLab and the six-blade side by side and he had volunteered for a demonstration, receiving what appeared to be accurate lab results in his email in-box before he even left the building. What he didn't know was that Elizabeth was planning to use the Walgreens launch and his accompanying article containing her misleading claims as the public validation she needed to kick-start a new fund-raising campaign, one that would propel Theranos to the forefront of the Silicon Valley stage.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mike Barsanti was vacationing in Lake Tahoe when he received a call on his cell phone from Donald A. Lucas, the son of legendary venture capitalist Donald L. Lucas. Mike and Don had gone to college together in the early 1980s at Santa Clara University and had remained friendly ever since. Mike was the retired chief financial officer of a Bay Area seafood and poultry business that his family had operated for more than six decades before selling it the previous year.</div>

<div class="line_en">Don was calling to pitch Mike on an investment: Theranos. That came as a surprise to Mike. He had last heard of the startup seven years earlier when he and Don had attended a twenty-minute presentation Elizabeth gave on Sand Hill Road showcasing her little blood-testing machine. Mike remembered Elizabeth very well: she'd come off as a dowdy young scientist back then, wearing Coke-bottle glasses and no makeup, speaking nervously to an audience of men two to three times her age. At the time, Don ran RWI Ventures, a firm he'd founded in the mid-1990s after spending ten years learning the ropes of the venture capital business working for his father. Mike had been an investor in RWI. His curiosity piqued by the awkward but obviously smart young woman, he'd asked Don why the firm wasn't taking a flyer on her like his father had. Don had replied that after careful consideration he'd decided against it. Elizabeth was all over the place, she wasn't focused, his father couldn't control her even though he chaired her board, and Don didn't like or trust her, Mike recalled his friend telling him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Don had launched a new firm in 2009 called the Lucas Venture Group. In recognition of her longstanding relationship with his aging father, who was addled by the onset of Alzheimer's disease, Elizabeth was giving him the chance to invest in the company at a discount to the price other investors were going to be offered in a big forthcoming fund-raising round. Intent on seizing what he saw as a great opportunity, the Lucas Venture Group was raising money for two new funds, Don told Mike. One of them was a traditional venture fund that would invest in several companies, including Theranos. The second would be exclusively devoted to Theranos. Did Mike want in? If so, time was short. The transaction had to close by the end of September.</div>

It also said the company had been "cash flow positive since 2006."</div>

<div class="line_en">A few weeks later, on the afternoon of September 9, 2013, Mike received an email from Don with the subject line "Theranos-time sensitive" that contained more details. The email, which went out to people who like Mike had previously invested in Don's funds, provided links to the Wall Street Journal article and to the Theranos press release from that morning. The Lucas Venture Group, it said, had been "invited" to invest up to $15 million in Theranos. The discounted price Elizabeth was offering the firm valued the company at $6 billion.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mike took a deep breath. That was a huge valuation. He couldn't help but be annoyed with Don. When his friend had brushed aside his suggestion that they invest seven years before, Theranos had been valued around $40 million, he remembered ruefully.</div>

When they arrived at Theranos's headquarters, a sprawling beige structure built into the side of a hill a stone's throw from the Stanford campus, the first thing they both noticed was the heavy security. There were multiple guards at the entrance and they had to sign nondisclosure agreements just to be allowed into the building. Once inside, guards escorted them everywhere, even to the bathroom.

<div class="line_en">Elizabeth and Sunny had always been security conscious, but their level of paranoia had reached a new peak with the launch in Walgreens stores. They had convinced themselves that Quest and LabCorp viewed Theranos as a mortal threat to their cozy oligopoly and that they would try to quash their new competitor by any means available. There was also the matter of the promise John Fuisz had made in his deposition to "fuck with" Elizabeth until she died. She took that threat very seriously. Following his retirement from the military earlier that year, James Mattis had joined the Theranos board and, on his recommendation, Elizabeth had hired Jim Rivera, the head of his Pentagon security detail. Rivera was a grizzled pro who had protected Mattis during his frequent trips to Iraq and Afghanistan. He wore a gun holstered under his jacket or around his ankle at all times and led a team of a half dozen guards who were dressed in black suits and wore earpieces.</div>

(Many blood tests involve several billing codes, so the actual number of tests represented by those thousand codes was in the low hundreds.)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第一次开会时，伊莉莎白和桑尼告诉两位访客，联邦医疗保险（Medicare）和民间健康保险业者付费委托实验室做的一千三百种检验项目中，有一千种都可以用Theranos扎手指技术进行——这是根据伙伴基金后来控告Theranos的诉讼内容。（很多血液检验都牵涉到好几个收费项目，所以那上千个收费项目实际上所涉及的检验数量只有一、二百种。）">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At a second meeting three weeks later, they showed them a PowerPoint presentation containing scatter plots purporting to compare test data from Theranos's proprietary analyzers to data from conventional lab machines. Each plot showed data points tightly clustered around a straight line that rose up diagonally from the horizontal x-axis. This indicated that Theranos's test results were almost perfectly correlated with those of the conventional machines. In other words, its technology was as accurate as traditional testing. The rub was that much of the data in the charts wasn't from the miniLab or even from the Edison. It was from other commercial blood analyzers Theranos had purchased, including one manufactured by a company located an hour north of Palo Alto called Bio-Rad.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几周后的第二次会议中，他们出示用PowerPoint做成的散布图，宣称要比较Theranos分析仪和传统实验室仪器做出的检验数据。每张图都显示数据点（data point）紧紧群集于一条直线周围，那条直线与平行的X轴呈对角线往上攀升，这代表Theranos的检测结果跟传统仪器的结果，呈现几乎完美的正相关，换句话说，Theranos的技术跟传统检验一样精确。问题是，图表上的数据并非来自迷你实验室或是爱迪生，而是出自Theranos购买的商用血液分析仪，其中一台的制造商就在帕罗奥图往北一小时车程处，公司名称是Bio-Rad。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sunny also told James and Grossman that Theranos had developed about three hundred different blood tests, ranging from commonly ordered tests to measure glucose, electrolytes, and kidney function to more esoteric cancer-detection tests. He boasted that Theranos could perform 98 percent of them on tiny blood samples pricked from a finger and that, within six months, it would be able to do all of them that way. These three hundred tests represented 99 to 99.9 percent of all laboratory requests, and Theranos had submitted every single one of them to the FDA for approval, he said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="桑尼还告诉詹姆士和葛罗斯曼，Theranos已经开发出三百种血液检测，从一般常见的血糖、电解质、肾功能检验，到极罕见的癌症侦测检验都有；他号称其中九成八只需要扎手指取得少少的血液样本就能做，而且不出半年百分之百都能这样做。那三百种检验可以满足实验室九成九到九成九九的需求，而且每项检验都已送交FDA核可，他这么说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sunny and Elizabeth's boldest claim was that the Theranos system was capable of running seventy different blood tests simultaneously on a single finger-stick sample and that it would soon be able to run even more. The ability to perform so many tests on just a drop or two of blood was something of a Holy Grail in the field of microfluidics. Thousands of researchers around the world in universities and industry had been pursuing this goal for more than two decades, ever since the Swiss scientist Andreas Manz had shown that the microfabrication techniques developed by the computer chip industry could be repurposed to make small channels that moved tiny volumes of fluids.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="桑尼和伊莉莎白最厚颜大胆的说词是：Theranos用一份手指血液样本就能同时运行七十种检验。只用一、二滴血就能运行这么多检验，是微流控技术领域的圣杯。自从瑞士科学家安德烈斯．曼斯（Andreas Manz）证明，电脑芯片产业所开发的微制程技术（microfabrication）可以改用于制作小小的渠道，供微量液体流经，此后二十多年来，全世界各大学与产业界数以千计研究员无不戮力以此为目标。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But it had remained beyond reach for a few basic reasons. The main one was that different classes of blood tests required vastly different methods. Once you'd used your micro blood sample to perform an immunoassay, there usually wasn't enough blood left for the completely different set of lab techniques a general chemistry or hematology assay required. Another was that, while microfluidic chips could handle very small volumes, no one had yet figured out how to avoid losing some of the sample during its transfer to the chip. Losing a little bit of the blood sample didn't matter much when it was large, but it became a big problem when it was tiny. To hear Elizabeth and Sunny tell it, Theranos had solved these and other difficulties -- challenges that had bedeviled an entire branch of bioengineering research.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但至今仍是力有未逮，因为有几个基本原因难解。主要原因是不同种类的检测需要极为不同的方法，一旦把微量的血液样本拿去用于免疫测定，剩下的血液所剩无几，通常不足以进行另一种全然不同的检验，如普通化学或血液测定。另一个问题是，虽然微流控芯片可以处理极小量，但尚未有人想出如何在样本移转到芯片过程中避免样本分量减损。如果血液样本很大的话，损失一点点还不打紧，但如果样本本身已经很微量就是大问题了。按照伊莉莎白和桑尼的说法，Theranos已经解决这些和其他难题——这些可是整个生物工程研究一直苦恼难解的挑战啊！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Besides Theranos's supposed scientific accomplishments, what helped win James and Grossman over was its board of directors. In addition to Shultz and Mattis, it now included former secretary of state Henry Kissinger, former secretary of defense William Perry, former Senate Arms Services Committee chairman Sam Nunn, and former navy admiral Gary Roughead. These were men with sterling, larger-than-life reputations who gave Theranos a stamp of legitimacy. The common denominator between all of them was that, like Shultz, they were fellows at the Hoover Institution. After befriending Shultz, Elizabeth had methodically cultivated each one of them and offered them board seats in exchange for grants of stock.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="除了Theranos那些被信以为真的科学成就外，令詹姆士和葛罗斯曼心动的另一个因素是Theranos董事会成员，里面不只有舒兹和马提斯，现在还多了前国务卿亨利．季辛吉（Henry Kissinger）、前国防部长威廉．裴瑞（William Perry）、前参议院军事委员会主席山姆．楠恩（Sam Nunn）、前海军上将盖瑞．罗福贺（Gary Roughead），这些人的声望都是如假包换、卓越不凡，等于给Theranos盖上正字标记。这些人的共同点是，他们跟舒兹都是胡佛研究所的研究员，伊莉莎白交上舒兹这个朋友后，便开始有计划地分别跟每个人培养关系，以无偿配股来换取他们答应出任董事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A spreadsheet with financial projections Sunny sent the hedge fund executives supported this notion. It forecast gross profits of $165 million on revenues of $261 million in 2014 and gross profits of $1.08 billion on revenues of $1.68 billion in 2015. Little did they know that Sunny had fabricated these numbers from whole cloth. Theranos hadn't had a real chief financial officer since Elizabeth had fired Henry Mosley in 2006. The closest thing the company had to one was a corporate controller named Danise Yam.</div>

<div class="line_en">The presence of these former cabinet members, congressmen, and military officials on the board also lent credence to Elizabeth and Sunny's assertions that Theranos's devices were being used in the field by the U. S. military. James and Grossman thought that Theranos's finger-stick offerings in Walgreens and Safeway stores were likely to be a hit with consumers and to capture a large share of the U. S. blood-testing market. A contract with the Department of Defense would add another big source of revenues.</div>

<div class="line_en">James and Grossman of course had no way of knowing that Theranos's internal projections were five- to twelvefold lower than the ones they were shown. It didn't occur to them that anything untoward could be going on at a company with such a prestigious board.

<div class="line_en">Six weeks after Sunny sent Partner Fund his projections, Yam sent very different ones to an advisory firm called Aranca for the purpose of pricing stock options for employees. Yam forecast a profit of $35 million in 2014 and of $100 million in 2015 ($130 million and $980 million less, respectively, than what Sunny projected to Partner Fund). The gap in revenues was even bigger: she predicted revenues of $50 million in 2014 and of $134 million in 2015 ($211 million and $1.55 billion less than the projections given to Partner Fund). As it would turn out, even Yam's numbers were wildly optimistic.</div>
