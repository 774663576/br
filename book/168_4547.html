<div class="line_en">Arya squirmed in the saddle and felt the links of the Hound's mail digging into her back. His arms encircled her; on the left, the burned arm, he'd donned a steel vambrace for protection, but she'd seen him change the dressings, and the flesh beneath was still raw and seeping. If the burns pained him, though, Sandor Clegane gave no hint of it.</div>

<div class="line_en">The rain was falling from a black iron sky, pricking the green and brown torrent with ten thousand swords. It must be a mile across, Arya thought. The tops of half a hundred trees poked up out the swirling waters, their limbs clutching for the sky like the arms of drowning men. Thick mats of sodden leaves choked the shoreline, and farther out in the channel she glimpsed something pale and swollen, a deer or perhaps a dead horse, moving swiftly downstream. There was a sound too, a low rumble at the edge of hearing, like the sound a dog makes just before he growls.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雨水从铁黑的天空中降落，仿佛万把利剑直刺进棕绿色的湍流。它定有一里之宽，艾莉亚心想。上百棵树的顶端从盘旋流水中伸出，枝条如溺水者的胳膊盲目地抓向天空。岸边积着厚厚一层树叶，好比潮湿的垫子，远处河中央某些苍白肿胀的物体迅速顺流飘下，也许是鹿，或者是马。耳际有种低沉的轰鸣，好像无数恶狗即将发出咆哮。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's a river we need to cross, that's all you need to know." Clegane would answer her from time to time, but he had warned her not to talk back. He had given her a lot of warnings that first day. "The next time you hit me, I'll tie your hands behind your back," he'd said. "The next time you try and run off, I'll bind your feet together. Scream or shout or bite me again, and I'll gag you. We can ride double, or I can throw you across the back of the horse trussed up like a sow for slaughter. Your choice." She had chosen to ride, but the first time they made camp she'd waited until she thought he was asleep, and found a big jagged rock to smash his ugly head in. Quiet as a shadow, she told herself as she crept toward him, but that wasn't quiet enough. The Hound hadn't been asleep after all. Or maybe he'd woken. Whichever it was, his eyes opened, his mouth twitched, and he took the rock away from her as if she were a baby. The best she could do was kick him. "I'll give you that one," he said, when he flung the rock into the bushes. "But if you're stupid enough to try again, I'll hurt you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这是一条需要过的河，知道这点就够了。”克里冈不时会给她答案，但明确警告她不许接口。打第一天起就作出许多警告。“再打人，就把你的手捆在后面，”他说，“再逃跑，就把你的脚给绑起来。再乱喊乱叫或咬我，就把嘴巴堵上。我们可以一起骑马，也可以把你横放马背，就像待宰的猪。你自己选。”她选骑马。然而头天宿营时，她一直等待，直到认为他睡着了，便找来一块参差不齐的大石头，准备砸扁那颗丑陋的脑袋。静如影，她一边告诉自己，一边悄悄接近，但却不够安静，也许猎狗根本没睡，或者醒了。不管怎样，他眼睛陡然睁开，嘴角抽搐了一下，将石头一把夺走，就当她是个小婴儿。她最多只能踢他。“我饶你这次，”他边说，边将石头扔进灌木丛，“如果笨到再试，就狠狠揍你。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There's no way across, she thought. Lord Beric will catch us for sure. Clegane had pushed his big black stallion hard, doubling back thrice to throw off pursuit, once even riding half a mile up the center of a swollen stream… but Arya still expected to see the outlaws every time she looked back. She had tried to help them by scratching her name on the trunks of trees when she went in the bushes to make water, but the fourth time she did it he caught her, and that was the end of that. It doesn't matter, Arya told herself, Thoros will find me in his flames. Only he hadn't. Not yet, anyway, and once they crossed the river…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没有过河的方法，她心想，贝里伯爵就会赶上。先前，克里冈拼命驱赶坐骑，还三次调头折返，以求摆脱掉追踪者，甚至在高涨的溪流中逆行半里地…艾莉亚每次回头，都期盼见到那帮土匪。她于灌木丛中小解时在树干上刻名字，试图帮助他们，但第四次时被他逮到，于是便到此为止。没关系，艾莉亚告诉自己，索罗斯会通过圣火找到我。但他没有，至少现在还没有，而一旦过了河…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After that, he rolled her in his horse blanket every night when he went to sleep, and tied ropes around her top and bottom so she was bound up as tight as a babe in swaddling clothes.</div>

<div class="line_en">It has to be the Blackwater, Arya decided as she watched the rain lash the river. The Hound was Joffrey's dog; he was taking her back to the Red Keep, to hand to Joffrey and the queen. She wished that the sun would come out, so she could tell which way they were going. The more she looked at the moss on the trees the more confused she got. The Blackwater wasn't so wide at King's Landing, but that was before the rains.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一定是黑水河，艾莉亚看着雨水抽打河面，心里断定。猎狗是乔佛里的狗儿，他要把她带回红堡，献给乔佛里和太后。她希望太阳出来，好能分辨方向。越是看树上的苔藓，她就越糊涂。黑水河在君临城附近没这么宽，但那是下雨之前的事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Harroway town shouldn't be far," the Hound said. "Where Lord Roote stables Old King Andahar's two-headed water horse. Maybe we'll ride across."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哈罗威的镇子应该不远，”猎狗说，“鲁特爵爷在那儿伺候着安达哈老王的双头水马。也许可以搭它过去。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Arya had never heard of Old King Andahar. She'd never seen a horse with two heads either, especially not one who could run on water, but she knew better than to ask. She held her tongue and sat stiff as the Hound turned the stallion's head and trotted along the ridgeline, following the river downstream. At least the rain was at their backs this way. She'd had enough of it stinging her eyes half-blind and washing down her cheeks like she was crying. Wolves never cry, she reminded herself again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="艾莉亚没听说过安达哈老王，也没见过两个头的马，特别是在水上跑的，但她知道最好别问。于是便闭口不语，直挺挺坐着，任猎狗调转马头，沿山脊小跑，顺河而下。这样子，至少雨水是落在背上。她受够了眼睛被大雨刺得半瞎的滋味，流水从脸颊淌下，好像在哭一样。冰原狼从来不哭，她再度提醒自己。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It could not have been much past noon, but the sky was dark as dusk. They had not seen the sun in more days than she could count. Arya was soaked to the bone, saddle-sore, sniffling, and achy. She had a fever too, and sometimes shivered uncontrollably, but when she'd told the Hound that she was sick he'd only snarled at her. "Wipe your nose and shut your mouth," he told her. Half the time he slept in the saddle now, trusting his stallion to follow whatever rutted farm track or game trail they were on. The horse was a heavy courser, almost as big as a destrier but much faster. Stranger, the Hound called him. Arya had tried to steal him once, when Clegane was taking a piss against a tree, thinking she could ride off before he could catch her. Stranger had almost bitten her face off. He was gentle as an old gelding with his master, but otherwise he had a temper as black as he was. She had never known a horse so quick to bite or kick.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="时间大概刚过正午，但天空暗如黄昏。她已数不清有多少天没见到太阳，雨水浸透骨头，整日骑马让她浑身酸痛，还有点发烧，流着鼻涕，有时不自禁地打颤，但当她告诉猎狗自己病了时，他只朝她咆哮。“擦干鼻子，闭上嘴巴。”他告诉她。其实到如今，骑马时连他也有一半时间在睡，信任坐骑自行挑选布满车辙的田间小路或猎人小径。这是匹壮实的骏马，差不多跟军马一般高大，但速度快得多。猎狗为他取名‘陌客’。有回趁克里冈对着一棵树小解时，艾莉亚试图偷走它，认为可以赶在他回头之前骑马跑掉，结果陌客差点把她的脸咬下来。对主子，他像老骟马样的温顺，但对其他人，脾气则糟透了。她从没见过咬人踢人这么利索的牲畜。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But there was smoke coming from the tower, Arya saw, and below one arched window a wide flat-bottomed boat was chained up tight. The boat had a dozen oarlocks and a pair of great carved wooden horse heads mounted fore and aft. The two-headed horse, she realized. There was a wooden house with a sod roof right in the middle of the deck, and when the Hound cupped his hands around his mouth and shouted two men came spilling out. A third appeared in the window of the roundtower, clutching a loaded crossbow. "What do you want?" he shouted across the swirling brown waters.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但艾莉亚看见那座塔里有烟升起，一扇拱窗下还用锁链牢牢系着一艘宽敞的平底船。此船有十来个桨架，船头和船尾各一只巨大的木雕马头。这就是双头马，她明白过来。甲板中央有个茅草为顶的木船舱，猎狗将双手拢在嘴边厉声呼喝，两个人从里面走出，第三个人出现在圆塔窗户内，端一把上好弩矢的十字弓。“你想干什么？”第三个人隔着盘旋的棕色水流喊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They rode beside the river for hours, splashing across two muddy vassal streams before they reached the place that Sandor Clegane had spoken of. "Lord Harroway's Town," he said, and then, when he saw it, "Seven hells!" The town was drowned and desolate. The rising waters had overflowed the riverbanks. All that remained of Harroway town was the upper story of a daub-and-wattle inn, the seven-sided dome of a sunken sept, two-thirds of a stone roundtower, some moldy thatch roofs, and a forest of chimneys.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们沿河骑行好几个钟头，溅起水花趟过两条浑浊的支流，才终于到达桑铎·克里冈所说的地方。“哈罗威伯爵的小镇，”他宣布，话音未落就被眼前的景象给惊呆了，“七层地狱！”这座镇子已被水淹没，无人居住。高涨的水流越过堤岸，全镇建筑物所剩无几，只见一栋土木结构客栈的上层，一幢塌陷圣堂的七面圆顶和一座圆塔碉堡的三分之二露出水面，除此之外，还有个别发霉的茅草屋盖和林立的烟囱。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The ferrymen were talking again. Finally the bent-backed one turned away and gave a shout. Six more men appeared, pulling up hoods to keep the rain off their heads. Still more squirmed out the holdfast window and leapt down onto the deck. Half of them looked enough like the bent-backed man to be his kin. Some of them undid the chains and took up long poles, while the others slid heavy wide-bladed oars through the locks. The ferry swung about and began to creep slowly toward the shallows, oars stroking smoothly on either side. Sandor Clegane rode down the hill to meet it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="船夫们又开始讨论。最后，那驼背转身喊了一声，舱内又走出六个人，全戴着兜帽挡雨，其他一些人从塔楼要塞的窗户里挤出来，跳下甲板。他们中有一半人长得跟那驼背颇为相像，似乎是他的亲戚。人们解开锁链，取出长长的撑篙，并将沉重的阔叶桨扣入桨架。渡船摇摇晃晃、缓缓地向着浅滩驶来，船桨在两侧流畅地划动。桑铎·克里冈骑下山冈，迎上前去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When the aft end of the boat slammed into the hillside, the ferrymen opened a wide door beneath the carved horse's head, and extended a heavy oaken plank. Stranger balked at the water's edge, but the Hound put his heels into the courser's flank and urged him up the gangway. The bent-backed man was waiting for them on deck. "Wet enough for you, ser?" he asked, smiling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等船尾撞上山坡，船夫们打开木雕马头下一扇宽门，伸出一条沉重的橡木板。陌客在水边畏缩不前，但猎狗双膝一夹马腹，催它走上跳板。驼背在甲板上等着他们。“湿透了吧，爵士？”他微笑着问。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The two-headed horse eased slowly through the shallows, picking its way between the chimneys and rooftops of drowned Harroway. A dozen men labored at the oars while four more used the long poles to push off whenever they came too close to a rock, a tree, or a sunken house. The bent-backed man had the rudder. Rain pattered against the smooth planks of the deck and splashed off the tall carved horseheads fore and aft. Arya was getting soaked again, but she didn't care. She wanted to see. The man with the crossbow still stood in the window of the roundtower, she saw. His eyes followed her as the ferry slid by underneath. She wondered if he was this Lord Roote that the Hound had mentioned. He doesn't look much like a lord. But then, she didn't look much like a lady either.</div>

<div class="line_en">If I jumped over the side, the river would wash me away before the Hound even knew that I was gone. She looked back over a shoulder, and saw Sandor Clegane struggling with his frightened horse, trying to calm him. She would never have a better chance to get away from him. I might drown, though. Jon used to say that she swam like a fish, but even a fish might have trouble in this river. Still, drowning might be better than King's Landing. She thought about Joffrey and crept up to the prow. The river was murky brown with mud and lashed by rain, looking more like soup than water. Arya wondered how cold it would be. I couldn't get much wetter than I am now She put a hand on the rail.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="假如我从边上跳下去，河水会把我冲走，而猎狗将毫无察觉。她转头后望，只见桑铎·克里冈正竭力安抚受惊的坐骑。这是最好的机会了。但我也许会被淹死。虽然琼恩曾说，她游起泳来像条鱼，但即便是鱼，在这条河里也可能有麻烦。不过，淹死好过回君临。她想到乔佛里，便悄悄爬到船头。河里满是褐色泥巴，在雨点的抽打搅拌下，看起来像汤不像水。艾莉亚疑惑地想，不知里面会有多冷。反正不可能比现在更潮湿阴冷了。她一只手搭到栏杆上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Once they were beyond the town and out in the river proper, the current grew much stronger. Through the grey haze of rain Arya could make out a tall stone pillar on the far shore that surely marked the ferry landing, but no sooner had she seen it than she realized that they were being pushed away from it, downstream. The oarsmen were rowing more vigorously now, fighting the rage of the river. Leaves and broken branches swirled past as fast as if they'd been fired from a scorpion. The men with the poles leaned out and shoved away anything that came too close. It was windier out here, too. Whenever she turned to look upstream, Arya got a face full of blowing rain. Stranger was screaming and kicking as the deck moved underfoot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一旦出了镇子，进入河里，水流陡然变强。透过灰黯朦胧的雨幕，艾莉亚辨出远方岸边一根高高的石柱，显然标识着靠岸之处，随即又意识到他们已被冲得偏离了方向，正往下游而去。桨手们划得起劲，跟狂暴的河流拼争。无数树叶和断枝转着圈迅速经过，仿佛是从弩弓里弹射出来的一样。拿长篙的人们斜身撑开任何过于接近的物体。在河中央，风也加大，每当艾莉亚扭头望向上游，就会扑面吃一脸雨水。甲板在脚下剧烈晃动，陌客一边嘶鸣一边乱踢。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But a sudden shout snapped her head about before she could leap. The ferrymen were rushing forward, poles in hand. For a moment she did not understand what was happening. Then she saw it: an uprooted tree, huge and dark, coming straight at them. A tangle of roots and limbs poked up out of the water as it came, like the reaching arms of a great kraken. The oarsmen were backing water frantically, trying to avoid a collision that could capsize them or stove their hull in. The old man had wrenched the rudder about, and the horse at the prow was swinging downstream, but too slowly. Glistening brown and black, the tree rushed toward them like a battering ram.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她还来不及跳，突然被一声大喝吸引了注意力。船夫们纷纷手执长篙往前冲去。一时间她不明白发生了什么，然后她看到了：一棵连根拔起的大黑树，正朝他们扑来。纠结的树根和树枝从流水里戳出，活像巨海怪伸展的触手。桨手们狂乱地划水，试图躲避开去，以免被撞翻或者戳穿船身。驼背老人扭转船舵，船头的马向下游偏转，但太慢了。那棵棕黑的树微微闪光，像攻城锤那样砸来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It could not have been more than ten feet from their prow when two of the boatmen somehow caught it with their long poles. One snapped, and the long splintering craaaack made it sound as if the ferry were breaking up beneath them. But the second man managed to give the trunk a hard shove, just enough to deflect it away from them. The tree swept past the ferry with inches to spare, its branches scrabbling like claws against the horsehead. Only just when it seemed as if they were clear, one of the monster's upper limbs dealt them a glancing thump. The ferry seemed to shudder, and Arya slipped, landing painfully on one knee. The man with the broken pole was not so lucky. She heard him shout as he stumbled over the side. Then the raging brown water closed over him, and he was gone in the time it took Arya to climb back to her feet. One of the other boatmen snatched up a coil of rope, but there was no one to throw it to.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两名船夫的长篙好容易抵住它时，它离船头已不超过十尺。一根篙子折断，发出“喀——嚓——”的长长碎裂声，仿佛渡船在他们的脚下撕裂。第二个人终于使劲将树干推开，刚好让它偏离。那棵树以数寸间距擦过渡船，枝杈如爪子样抓向马头。然而，似乎已经安全的时候，那怪物的上部分枝杈“嘭”的一声扫过，令渡船剧烈颤抖，艾莉亚脚一滑，痛苦地单膝跪倒。那个篙子被折断的人就没那么幸运了，她听见他从侧面翻落下去时的呼叫，湍急的褐色水流旋即将他淹没，当艾莉亚爬起来，人已消失。另一船夫抓过一捆绳子，却不知该扔给谁。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Maybe he'll wash up someplace downstream, Arya tried to tell herself, but the thought had a hollow ring. She had lost all desire to go swimming. When Sandor Clegane shouted at her to get back inside before he beat her bloody, she went meekly. The ferry was fighting to turn back on course by then, against a river that wanted nothing more than to carry it down to the sea.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="也许他会在下游某处被冲上岸，艾莉亚试图告诉自己，但这个想法显得如此空洞，令她失去了所有游水的意愿。桑铎·克里冈大喊，让她回里面去，否则就狠狠揍她。她乖乖照办。很明显，此刻渡船正与河流作殊死搏斗，争取重新返回航线，而这条河一心想把它冲进海里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When they finally came ashore, it was a good two miles downriver of their usual landing. The boat slammed into the bank so hard that another pole snapped, and Arya almost lost her feet again. Sandor Clegane lifted her onto Stranger's back as if she weighed no more than a doll.

The ferrymen threw curses at their backs, and one or two threw stones. Clegane ignored rocks and words alike, and before long they were lost in the gloom of the trees, the river a dwindling roar behind them.
