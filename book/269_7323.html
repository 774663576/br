<div class="line_en">"I don't mind staying," I said. I still hadn't been able to sink back into my protective shell of numbness, and everything seemed oddly close and loud today, like I'd taken cotton out of my ears. I tried to tune out the laughing hikers without success.</div>

"I've seen grizzlies pretty close up in Yellowstone, but they had nothing on this brute." His hair was matted, and his clothes looked like they'd been on his back for more than a few days.

<div class="line_en">It was a slow afternoon at Newton's. At the moment there were only two patrons in the store, dedicated backpackers from the sound of their conversation. Mike had spent the last hour going through the pros and cons of two brands of lightweight packs with them.

<div class="line_en">The doors slid open to let me out into the rain. I hunched over inside my jacket as I dashed for my truck. The rain hammering against my hood sounded unusually loud, too, but soon the roar of the engine drowned out everything else.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="门滑开了，我走进了雨里。当我跑向卡车的时候，我弯下腰躲进我的夹克里。雨滴击打着我车盖的声音也是异乎寻常的嘈杂，但不一会我发动机的咆哮声就盖过了一切。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My nightmare probably wouldn't even frighten someone else. Nothing jumped out and screamed, "Boo!" There were no zombies, no ghosts, no psychopaths. There was nothing, really. Only nothing. Just the endless maze of moss-covered trees, so quiet that the silence was an uncomfortable pressure against my eardrums. It was dark, like dusk on a cloudy day, with only enough light to see that there was nothing to see. I hurried through the gloom without a path, always searching, searching, searching, getting more frantic as the time stretched on, trying to move faster, though the speed made me clumsy… Then there would come the point in my dream -- and I could feel it coming now, but could never seem to wake myself up before it hit -- when I couldn't remember what it was that I was searching for. When I realized that there was nothing to search for, and nothing to find. That there never had been anything more than just this empty, dreary wood, and there never would be anything more for me… nothing but nothing…</div>

The nightmare was nagging at my mind and making me think about things that would cause me pain. I didn't want to remember the forest.

<div class="line_en">I wondered how long this could last. Maybe someday, years from now -- if the pain would just decrease to the point where I could bear it -- I would be able to look back on those few short months that would always be the best of my life. And, if it were possible that the pain would ever soften enough to allow me to do that, I was sure that I would feel grateful for as much time as he'd given me. More than I'd asked for, more than I'd deserved. Maybe someday I'd be able to see it that way.</div>

<div class="line_en">I held myself tightly together. As if he'd never existed, I thought in despair. What a stupid and impossible promise to make! He could steal my pictures and reclaim his gifts, but that didn't put things back the way they'd been before I'd met him. The physical evidence was the most insignificant part of the equation. I was changed, my insides altered almost past the point of recognition. Even my outsides looked different -- my face sallow, white except for the purple circles the nightmares had left under my eyes. My eyes were dark enough against my pallid skin that -- if I were beautiful, and seen from a distance -- I might even pass for a vampire now. But I was not beautiful, and I probably looked closer to a zombie.</div>

<div class="line_en">I concentrated on my hopeless proposition to keep from sliding back into the excruciating memories. To be reckless in Forks would take a lot of creativity -- maybe more than I had. But I wished I could find some way… I might feel better if I weren't holding fast, all alone, to a broken pact. If I were an oath-breaker, too. But how could I cheat on my side of the deal, here in this harmless little town? Of course, Forks hadn't always been so harmless, but now it was exactly what it had always appeared to be. It was dull, it was safe.</div>

I was standing in front of the Cheneys' house -- my truck was blocking their driveway -- and across the road lived the Markses. I knew I needed to move my truck, and that I ought to go home.

With the long, wet stretches of freeway twisting and turning through the forest, blind corner after blind corner, there was no shortage of that kind of action. But even with all the huge log-haulers barreling around the turns, mostly people walked away. The exceptions to that rule were often on motorcycles, and Charlie had seen one too many victims, almost always kids, smeared on the highway. He'd made me promise before I was ten that I would never accept a ride on a motorcycle. Even at that age, I didn't have to think twice before promising. Who would want to ride a motorcycle here? It would be like taking a sixty-mile-per-hour bath.</div>

Jacob's head peered out of the window before I could even get out of the truck. No doubt the familiar roar of the engine had tipped him off to my approach.

<div class="line_en">"Maybe when the bikes are finished -- our present to ourselves," I added.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“也许当这些车修好后——这就是我们给自己的礼物，”我补充到。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I bit my lip, embarrassed. "They're in my truck now," I admitted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我咬了下嘴唇，有点不好意思。“它们现在在我的卡车上，”我承认到。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I needed to reign in the enthusiasm before I gave him the wrong idea -- it was just that it had been a long time since I'd felt so light and buoyant. The rarity of the feeling made it more difficult to manage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在我向他发出错误信号前我需要控制一下我的热情——只是我已经有很长时间没有感觉到如此的轻松和愉快了。正是因为这感觉的罕见让我更难控制它。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I sniffed. "Close."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我吸了下鼻子，“差不多了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Sounds like a date."</div>

<div class="line_en">His eyes sparkled at the word.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的眼睛因为这个词而闪了一下光。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You missed it," he teased, narrowing his eyes in mock resentment. "I'm sixteen."</div>

<div class="line_en">We eased around from the east, sticking to the trees when we were in view of the windows, affecting a casual-looking stroll, just in case. Jacob unloaded the bikes swiftly from the truck bed, wheeling them one by one into the shrubbery where I hid. It looked too easy for him -- I'd remembered the bikes being much, much heavier than that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们沿着树木从东边慢慢移过去，当我们进入从窗户可以看到的视野范围内时，我们就假装成平常的漫步的样子，只是为了以防万一。雅各布迅速的把车从卡车上搬下来，把它们一个个滚到我躲着的灌木丛里。这看起来对他很轻松——我记得那些摩托车应该是比那更重的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Deal. When will you bring them down?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“成交。你什么时候把它们送过来？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As we skulked back to the makeshift garage, I contemplated my luck. Only a teenage boy would agree to this: deceiving both our parents while repairing dangerous vehicles using money meant for my college education. He didn't see anything wrong with that picture. Jacob was a gift from the gods.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们偷偷摸摸的回到那个勉强可以称为车库的地方，我思考着我的好运气。只有一个十几岁的男孩才会同意这么做：瞒着双方的父母用接受大学教育的钱修理这些危险的机车。他看不到这件事的不妥之处。雅各布是上帝赐予我的礼物。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I've got some money saved. College fund, you know." College, schmollege, I thought to myself. It wasn't like I'd saved up enough to go anywhere special -- and besides, I had no desire to leave Forks anyway. What difference would it make if I skimmed a little bit off the top?</div>
