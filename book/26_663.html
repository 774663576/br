<div class="line_en">What I had said to Mrs. Grose was true enough: there were in the matter I had put before her depths and possibilities that I lacked resolution to sound; so that when we met once more in the wonder of it we were of a common mind about the duty of resistance to extravagant fancies. We were to keep our heads if we should keep nothing else -- difficult indeed as that might be in the face of what, in our prodigious experience, was least to be questioned.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我对格罗斯太太所说的话句句属实：我缺乏决心去调查，只是把那些奇妙的、可能发生的事列举在她面前，所以当我们再次遇到这奇怪的事时，我们有了共同的想法，担起抵制这些天方夜谭的责任。如果别的无法做到，我们起码应该保持头脑清醒——这的确很难，凭我们不寻常的经验来看，我们起码面对的是不容置疑的事实。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Late that night, while the house slept, we had another talk in my room, when she went all the way with me as to its being beyond doubt that I had seen exactly what I had seen. To hold her perfectly in the pinch of that, I found I had only to ask her how, if I had "made it up!" I came to be able to give, of each of the persons appearing to me, a picture disclosing, to the last detail, their special marks -- a portrait on the exhibition of which she had instantly recognized and named them. She wished of course -- small blame to her!-- To sink the whole subject; and I was quick to assure her that my own interest in it had now violently taken the form of a search for the way to escape from it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天深夜，其他人都睡了，我和格罗斯太太在我的房间里又进行了一次谈话，这次她完全同意我的看法：毫无疑问，我看到了一切。如果我已经想好怎么说，我发现只要问她“怎么样”，就能引起她的注意。我能说出每一个我所见到的人的每个细节和特征，就像一幅慢慢展开的画轴——一幅展览中的图画，她立刻就能认出并说出他们的名字。她当然希望她只要担负小部分的责任，就能解决整个问题。我很快向她保证，我对此事的所有兴趣都只在于找到出路，得到解脱。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="在我第一次释放出所有感情后，我离开了她，当然又回到我的学生们身边，我已经发现我能积极地培养他们的人格，而且也从未失败过，这正是能治愈我的沮丧的对症良药。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I encountered her on the ground of a probability that with recurrence -- for recurrence we took for granted -- I should get used to my danger, distinctly professing that my personal exposure had suddenly become the least of my discomforts. It was my new suspicion that was intolerable; and yet even to this complication the later hours of the day had brought a little ease.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我告诉她怪事可能再次出现——我们只是想当然地这么认为——我应该习惯自己面临的危险，而且明确地表示，突然间，我个人的安危已是最不令我担心的问题了。我难以按捺自己新的怀疑，尽管情况很复杂，但在这一天中后来的几个小时里，还是让我松了一口气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I had simply, in other words, plunged afresh into Flora's special society and there become aware -- it was almost a luxury! -- That she could put her little conscious hand straight upon the spot that ached. She had looked at me in sweet speculation and then had accused me to my face of having "cried."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="换句话说，我完全又重新投入到弗洛拉特殊的世界中，并且意识到——那几乎就是一种享受！她能将她小巧而敏感的手直接放到我那痛处。她用温暖甜美的眼神看着我，然后问我脸上为什么有哭过的痕迹。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">To gaze into the depths of blue of the child's eyes and pronounce their loveliness a trick of premature cunning was to be guilty of a cynicism in preference to which I naturally preferred to abjure my judgment and, so far as might be, my agitation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我看着孩子那深沉的蓝眼睛，声称它们的可爱只不过是早熟的狡黠的表象，会让人有种不负责任的负疚感，但是目前为止，我更愿意放弃之前对她的判断和自己的不安情绪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was a pity that I should have had to quaver out again the reasons for my not having, in my delusion, so much as questioned that the little girl saw our visitant even as I actually saw Mrs. Grose herself, and that she wanted, by just so much as she did thus see, to make me suppose she didn't, and at the same time, without showing anything, arrive at a guess as to whether I myself did! It was a pity that I needed once more to describe the portentous little activity by which she sought to divert my attention -- the perceptible increase of movement, the greater intensity of play, the singing, the gabbling of nonsense, and the invitation to romp.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="很遗憾，我早就该琢磨清楚为何在那错觉之下没有盘问弗洛拉是否看见了这个不速之客——就像我看见格罗斯太太那样真切——即使她的确亲眼看到，却不想让我猜到她看见了，而且毫不流露出任何迹象，暗中猜想是否我也看到了！很遗憾，我需要再一次描述她那些奇怪的小动作，她借此试图转移我的注意力——明显的增加动作，很卖力地玩，高声地歌唱，喋喋不休地闲话，还有一些顽皮的举动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I couldn't abjure for merely wanting to, but I could repeat to Mrs. Grose -- as I did there, over and over, in the small hours -- that with their voices in the air, their pressure on one's heart, and their fragrant faces against one's cheek, everything fell to the ground but their incapacity and their beauty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我不能仅仅出于想要这样而放弃，但是我可以对格罗斯太太重申——就像我在深夜里向她一再重复的一样——当他们的声音在空中回荡时，当他们在你的心头占有很大分量时，当他们用幸福的脸庞贴着你的脸颊时，一切都站不住脚，只有他们的无助和美丽。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was a pity that, somehow, to settle this once for all, I had equally to re-enumerate the signs of subtlety that, in the afternoon, by the lake had made a miracle of my show of self-possession. It was a pity to be obliged to reinvestigate the certitude of the moment itself and repeat how it had come to me as a revelation that the inconceivable communion I then surprised was a matter, for either party, of habit.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="很遗憾，不知什么原因，为了彻底解决此事，我又重新在心里列举了那天下午在湖边时，我奇迹般地表现出的种种泰然自若的微妙迹象。很遗憾，我不得不重新调查那一刻的情境，重温它是如何成为我的新发现的——当时那令我感到惊讶的难以想象的沟通，对我们双方来说，其实是一种习惯性的行为。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Yet if I had not indulged, to prove there was nothing in it, in this review, I should have missed the two or three dim elements of comfort that still remained to me. I should not for instance have been able to asseverate to my friend that I was certain -- which was so much to the good -- that I at least had not betrayed myself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，如果不是因为我沉溺于证明那次事件并无隐情，这次回顾当中，我会错过两三个仍在我心中、模糊但值得欣慰的因素。例如，我就不能向我的朋友声明说，我确信我至少没有背叛过自己——这对我来说很有益。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I should not have been prompted, by stress of need, by desperation of mind -- I scarce know what to call it -- to invoke such further aid to intelligence as might spring from pushing my colleague fairly to the wall. She had told me, bit by bit, under pressure, a great deal; but a small shifty spot on the wrong side of it all still sometimes brushed my brow like the wing of a bat; and I remember how on this occasion -- for the sleeping house and the concentration alike of our danger and our watch seemed to help -- I felt the importance of giving the last jerk to the curtain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我就不会出于压力的驱使，在绝望意识的怂恿下——我真不知道怎样说它——想尽一切办法让格罗斯太太说出实情。在我不断地施压下，她一点一点地告诉了我许多事，但有时候稍稍向坏的一面考虑一下的念头，又像蝙蝠的翅膀一样划过我的额头。我记得当时——沉睡的古屋，还有我们对危险的警惕，集中起来帮助我——让我感到扯下幕布的最后一角极为重要。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don't believe anything so horrible," I recollect saying; "no, let us put it definitely, my dear, that I don't. But if I did, you know, there's a thing I should require now, just without sparing you the least bit more -- oh, not a scrap, come! -- To get out of you. What was it you had in mind when, in our distress, before Miles came back, over the letter from his school, you said, under my insistence, that you didn't pretend for him that he had not literally EVER been 'bad'? He has NOT literally 'ever,' in these weeks that I myself have lived with him and so closely watched him; he has been an imperturbable little prodigy of delightful, lovable goodness. Therefore you might perfectly have made the claim for him if you had not, as it happened, seen an exception to take. What was your exception, and to what passage in your personal observation of him did you refer?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不相信任何恐怖的事情，”我回想起自己曾说，“不，亲爱的，让我们把我不相信的事弄清楚。但是如果我相信了，你知道，我现在就请求你对这件事不要有半点隐瞒——哦，一点儿也不隐瞒，说吧！——通通说出来吧。你心里是怎么想的？当迈尔斯回来前，我们收到了一封他学校的来信的时候，我们都很痛苦，在我坚持要听你的意见时，你说他从来不是个真正的”坏“孩子。他确实不是一个真正的坏孩子，这几周我和他生活在一起，近距离地观察过他，他是一个沉稳冷静、惹人喜爱、可爱善良的小神童。如果你没有发现什么例外的事件发生的话，你当时一定会完完全全地替他辩护的。你发现的那个例外是什么？你指的又是据你观察到的他的哪些表现？”">查看中文翻译</div>
