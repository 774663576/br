<div class="line_en">I was again on the road, again at the wheel of the old blue sedan, again alone. Rita had still been dead to the world when I read that letter and fought the mountains of agony it raised within me. I had glanced at her as she smiled in her sleep and had kissed her on her moist brow, and had left her forever, with a note of tender adieu which I taped to her navel -- otherwise she might not have found it.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Alone" did I say? Pas tout à fait. I had my little black chum with me, and as soon as I reached a secluded spot, I rehearsed Mr. Richard F. Schiller's violent death. I had found a very old and very dirty gray sweater of mine in the back of the car, and this I hung up on a branch, in a speechless glade, which I had reached by a wood road from the now remote highway. The carrying out of the sentence was a little marred by what seemed to me a certain stiffness in the play of the trigger, and I wondered if I should get some oil for the mysterious thing but decided I had no time to spare. Back into the car went the old dead sweater, now with additional perforations, and having reloaded warm Chum, I continued my journey.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我是说“独自一人”吗？不完全如此。我有我黑乎乎的小密友陪着我，刚到一个僻静的地方，我就排演起理查德。弗。希勒暴死的场面。我从车后找出一件又破旧又脏的灰毛衣，把它挂在一根树枝上，这片林间空地悄无声息，我是从现在已离远的高速公路再穿一条林荫小路，才驶到这儿的。死刑的执行略有些美中不足，我觉得开枪时扳机有些生涩，我还想是否要给这个神秘的家伙上点油，但最后认定我没有时间了。把那件早就死了的旧毛衣扔回车上，现在它身上又多了九个弹孔；而后给温热的“密友’再压上些子弹，便继续赶路。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The letter was dated September 18, 1952 (this was September 22), and the address she gave was "General Delivery, Coalmont" (not "Va.," not "Pa.," not "Tenn."-- and not Coalmont, anyway -- I have camouflaged everything, my love). Inquiries showed this to be a small industrial community some eight hundred miles from New York City. At first I planned to drive all day and all night, but then thought better of it and rested for a couple of hours around dawn in a motor court room, a few miles before reaching the town. I had made up my mind that the fiend, this Schiller, had been a car salesman who had perhaps got to know my Lolita by giving her a ride in Beardsley -- the day her bike blew a tire on the way to Miss Emperor -- and that he had got into some trouble since then. The corpse of the executed sweater, no matter how I changed its contours as it lay on the back seat of the car, had kept revealing various outlines pertaining to Trapp-Schiller -- the grossness and obscene bonhommie of his body, and to counteract this taste of coarse corruption I resolved to make myself especially handsome and smart as I pressed home the nipple of my alarm clock before it exploded at the set hour of six A. M. Then, with the stern and romantic care of a gentleman about to fight a duel, I checked the arrangement of my papers, bathed and perfumed my delicate body, shaved my face and chest, selected a silk shirt and clean drawers, pulled on transparent taupe socks, and congratulated myself for having with me in my trunk some very exquisite clothes -- a waistcoat with nacreous buttons, for instance, a pale cashmere tie and so on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="信上的日期是一九五二年九月十八日（今天是九月二十二日），她给的地址是“科尔蒙待，公众拯救处”（不是“弗吉尼亚”，不是“宾夕法尼亚”，无论如何——我隐瞒了一切，我的爱）。查问之后才知这是一个工业小镇，离纽约市大约八百英里。最初，我打算日夜兼程，后来仔细想了想，还是在黎明时分，在离小镇几英里的一家汽车旅馆休息了几小时。我已确定无疑，那个魔鬼希勒一定曾是个汽车商，可能在比尔兹利，他用车带过洛丽塔才认识了她——就是那天，洛丽塔去恩普罗小姐家，路上，一只轮胎坏了——从那时起，他就开始惹祸。遭了枪杀的毛衣死尸，躺在车后座上；不管我怎样拨弄它，它总是显出各种各样与特拉普——希勒极为相似的轮廓——他肉体的粗俗肥胖、猴爽温和。于是，为了与这祖俗和丑陋形成鲜明对比，我决心让自己打扮得出奇的英俊潇洒，同时，在闹钟六点钟规定报时之前先把钟上的那个小旋纽摈了下去。然后，带着一名绅士要去决斗时所有的决断和谨慎，我检查了我的书信文件，洗了澡，在我孱弱的身体上喷洒了香水，刮了脸和胸，挑了一件丝质衬衫和一 件干净的内裤，又穿上透明的灰褐色短袜，庆贺自己还在衣箱里带了些精致的衣服——比如，一件带真珠质纽扣的马甲，一条乳白色开司米领带，等等。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I was not able, alas, to hold my breakfast, but dismissed that physicality as a trivial contretemps, wiped my mouth with a gossamer handkerchief produced from my sleeve, and, with a blue block of ice for heart, a pill on my tongue and solid death in my hip pocket, I stepped neatly into a telephone booth in Coalmont (Ah-ah-ah, said its little door) and rang up the only Schiller -- Paul, Furniture -- to be found in the battered book. Hoarse Paul told me he did know a Richard, the son of a cousin of his, and his address was, let me see, 10 Killer Street (I am not going very far for my pseudonyms). Ah-ah-ah, said the little door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哎！我不能承受我吃下去的早饭，但，我把那种肉体上的需求当成不合时宜的细校末节，于是从衣袖里抽出一条薄纱手帕抹了抹嘴，然后带上一大块灰乎乎的冰，以防万一心脏出了毛病，还在嘴里含了一片药，把实心的死神塞在裤后袋里，我干净利索地走进科尔蒙特的一间电话亭（它的小门呀、呀、呀地叫着），把电话挂给那本烂糟糟的电话簿里唯 一能找到的希勒——弗尼彻保尔，嘶哑的保尔告诉我，他确实认识一个理查，是他的一个表兄的儿子，他的住址是，让我想想，凶手街10号（我还假造不出这样的名称）。呀呀呀，门又叫。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At 10 Killer Street, a tenement house, I interviewed a number of dejected old people and two long-haired strawberry-blond incredibly grubby nymphets (rather abstractly, just for the heck of it, the ancient beast in me was casting about for some lightly clad child I might hold against me for a minute, after the killing was over and nothing mattered any more, and everything was allowed). Yes, Dick Skiller had lived there, but had moved when he married. Nobody knew his address. "They might know at the store," said a bass voice from an open manhole near which I happened to be standing with the two thin-armed, barefoot little girls and their dim grandmothers. I entered the wrong store and a wary old Negro shook his head even before I could ask anything. I crossed over to a bleak grocery and there, summoned by a customer at my request, a woman's voice from some wooden abyss in the floor, the manhole's counterpart, cried out: Hunter Road, last house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凶手街10号，是套分租住房，我在那儿访问了一些消沉的老人，还访问了两个长头发的性感少女，鲜艳如熟透的革莓、却又邋遢得今人难以置信（见鬼，真是难以理解，我体内古老的兽性又在窥探穿薄衣衫的女孩儿，等谋杀结束，什么都无关紧要，什么都可以不必在乎之时，我或许能把她们搂在怀里，紧紧地抱一会）。不错，狄克。斯基勒确实在那儿住过，可结婚时就搬走了。没有人知道他的住址。“商店里可能有人知道”，一个低沉的声音从一个敞开的门口里说道，我恰好站在近旁身边是两个细胳膊、赤脚的女孩子以及她们神色暗然的老祖母们。我进错了商店，根本还没开口，一个审慎的老黑人就摇起头。我又过马路进了一家很萧条的杂货店。听了我的问话，一位顾客帮我招唤起来，而后，一个女人的声音不是从什么木头板后面，就是从另一个门口喊出来：猎人路，最后那间屋。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">My pulse was 40 one minute and 100 the next. The drizzle crepitated against the hood of the car. My gun had migrated to my right trouser pocket. A nondescript cur came out from behind the house, stopped in surprise, and started good-naturedly woof-woofing at me, his eyes slit, his shaggy belly all muddy, and then walked about a little and woofed once more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我的脉搏刚刚还是每分钟四十，这会儿正是每分钟一百。小雨点噼噼啪啪打在车顶上。我早已把枪挪到右裤兜里。一条难以形容的劣种狗从屋后走出来，惊异地站住了，然后便开始很温厚地朝着我汪汪地叫，它的眼睛眯成了一条缝，长满粗毛的肚皮上沾满了泥巴，它来回小小走了一圈，又汪汪地叫了一遍。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hunter Road was miles away, in an even more dismal district, all dump and ditch, and wormy vegetable garden, and shack, and gray drizzle, and red mud, and several smoking stacks in the distance. I stopped at the last "house"-- a clapboard shack, with two or three similar ones farther away from the road and a waste of withered weeds all around. Sounds of hammering came from behind the house, and for several minutes I sat quite still in my old car, old and frail, at the end of my journey, at my gray goal, finis, my friends, finis, my fiends. The time was around two.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="猎人路在几英里以外一个更污浊的地区，垃圾堆、臭水沟和虫灾的蔬菜园遍地皆是，还有简陋的小木屋，灰蒙蒙的细雨，血红的泥浆，远处几个冒烟的烟囱。我停在最后那间“屋”前——一间用护墙板搭起来的小屋；离这条路更远些的地方，还有两、三处这样的小屋，周围杂草枯叶丛生。锤声从屋后传来，有好几分钟，我一动不动坐在我的破车里，破旧，又脆弱不堪。到了行程的终点，到了这灰暗的目的地。终点，我的朋友们：终点，我的恶魔们。时间是两点左右。">查看中文翻译</div>
