<div class="line_cn" title="她很确定帕克吻过提娜，还干过其他事。提娜那么瘦小，帕克可以环抱她，两只手还可以在提娜腰部相握。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Before she could think it through, Eleanor turned the wrong way down the hall and headed for the door to the football field. She acted like she was supposed to be walking out of the building in the middle of the day, like she was on some kind of weeping/half-dressed/drippy-bag mission.</div>

<div class="line_en">There were no classrooms at this end of the school, so at least no one was watching her.

<div class="line_cn" title="学校这一头没有教室，所以至少没人在看她。她紧贴着建筑边缘走，转弯后，她弯腰从窗户下走过。她想过就这么一路走回家，但结果可能更惨，至少路程就比较远。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a trash can sitting right outside the door, and she got up and hurled the Food 4 Less bag into it. She wiped her eyes with her gymsuit. Okay, she told herself, taking a deep breath, get it together. Don't let them get to you. Those were her new jeans in the trash. And her favorite shoes. Her Vans. She walked over to the trash and shook her head, reaching down for the bag. Fuck you, Tina. Fuck you to the moon.</div>
