<div class="line_en">They found a place where they could scramble up, and in about ten minutes stood panting at the top. They cast a longing look back at the valley-land of Narnia and then turned their faces to the North. The vast, lonely moor stretched on and up as far as they could see. On their left was rockier ground. Jill thought that must be the edge of the giants' gorge and did not much care about looking in that direction. They set out.</div>

<div class="line_en">"The giants mainly live along the side of that gorge," he said. "You might say the gorge was like a street to them. We'll do better straight ahead, even though it's a bit steep."</div>

<div class="line_en">At about nine o'clock next morning three lonely figures might have been seen picking their way across the Shribble by the shoals and stepping-stones. It was a shallow, noisy stream, and even Jill was not wet above her knees when they reached the northern bank. About fifty yards ahead, the land rose up to the beginning of the moor, everywhere steeply, and often in cliffs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天早上九点左右，只见三个孤零零的身影专拣浅滩的地方，踩着踏脚石头过河。斯力布河是一条浅浅的、喧闹的小河，他们到达北岸时，连吉尔也只湿到膝盖以下。前面大约五十码的地方，地面就升高了，荒原就从那里开始，到处地势都陡峭险峻，还有不少峭壁。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I do believe," thought Jill, "that all the stories about giants might have come from those funny rocks. If you were coming along here when it was half dark, you could easily think those piles of rock were giants. Look at that one, now! You could almost imagine that the lump on top was a head. It would be rather too big for the body, but it would do well enough for an ugly giant. And all that bushy stuff -- I suppose it's heather and birds' nests, really -- would do quite well for hair and beard. And the things sticking out on each side are quite like ears. They'd be horribly big, but then I dare say giants would have big ears, like elephants. And -- o-o-o-h!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我确信，”吉尔想道，“凡是写巨人的故事都可能来源于那些有趣的岩石。要是你在天快黑的时候上这儿来，很容易把那些一堆堆的石头当做巨人。瞧瞧那一块，嗨！你几乎可以想像那顶上的一块就是一个脑袋。虽然这脑袋太大了些，跟身体不相称，但是对丑陋的巨人来说就够好的了。还有那些浓密的东西——我猜实际上那些是石南和鸟窝吧——就当成头发和胡子也不错。还有一边高出一块的很像是耳朵。这耳朵大得吓人，不过我敢说巨人和象一样都会有大耳朵。还有——哦——哦！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was good, springy ground for walking, and a day of pale winter sunlight. As they got deeper into the moor, the loneliness increased: one could hear peewits and see an occasional hawk. When they halted in the middle of the morning for a rest and a drink in a little hollow by a stream, Jill was beginning to feel that she might enjoy adventures after all, and said so.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这儿的土地走起路来很舒服，又松又软，整天都有淡淡的冬天的阳光。他们越深入荒原，那份荒凉感越厉害：听得见红嘴鸥鸣叫，偶尔也看得见一只鹰。中午前他们停下来休息，在一条小河边的一个小水坑里喝了点水。吉尔开始觉得她终究还是喜欢探险的，就这样说了出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Walks after the first halt -- like school mornings after break or railway journeys after changing trains -- never go on as they were before. When they set out again, Jill noticed that the rocky edge of the gorge had drawn nearer. And the rocks were less flat, more upright, than they had been. In fact they were like little towers of rock. And what funny shapes they were!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第一次休息以后——就像学校里早上休息过后，或是铁路旅行中换车后那样——走起路来跟以前就大不一样了。他们重新上路时，吉尔注意到峡谷的岩边越来越近。而且比起刚才那些岩石，这些岩石高高低低，更加垂直。事实上，这些岩石就像一座座小小的岩塔。这些形状多有趣啊。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Her blood froze. The thing moved. It was a real giant. There was no mistaking it; she had seen it turn its head. She had caught a glimpse of the great, stupid, puffcheeked face. All the things were giants, not rocks. There were forty or fifty of them, all in a row; obviously standing with their feet on the bottom of the gorge and their elbows resting on the edge of the gorge, just as men might stand leaning on a wall -- lazy men, on a fine morning after breakfast.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的血冻结了。那东西动起来了。原来是个真正的巨人。一点没错；她已经看见他扭过头来了。她看见那张又大又蠢、鼓起腮帮子的脸。所有这些东西都是巨人，不是岩石。他们大约有四五十个，排成一排，显然是站在峡谷底层，手拐儿搁在峡谷边上，就像人们靠墙站着一样——像懒洋洋的男人早晨吃完早饭时那副模样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So they kept on, pretending not to have seen the giants. It was like walking past the gate of a house where there is a fierce dog, only far worse. There were dozens and dozens of these giants. They didn't look angry -- or kind or interested at all. There was no sign that they had seen the travellers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们就这样继续往前走，装作没看见那些巨人。正像走过一幢有恶狗的屋子的大门那样，只是更吓人。那儿有好几十个这种巨人。他们看来既不生气也不和气，也不对什么流露出一点兴趣。没有迹象表明他们看见了这些行人。">查看中文翻译</div>

It's safe enough; they're such very bad shots. They play cock-shies most fine mornings. About the only game they're clever enough to understand."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，要是他们对准我们，我们反而安全多了。他们是想掷那个——右边那个石堆。他们掷不中的，你们知道吗？那儿够安全的，因为他们个个都是其糟无比的投手。天好时他们大多玩掷石头打靶，凭他们那点聪明只懂这种游戏。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was a horrible time. There seemed no end to the line of giants, and they never ceased hurling stones, some of which fell extremely close. Quite apart from the real danger, the very sight and sound of their faces and voices were enough to scare anyone. Jill tried not to look at them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那段时间真可怕，那排巨人似乎长得没完没了，他们一直不停地掷石头，有几块落在很近的地方。除了真正的危险，看看他们的脸，听听他们的声音也够吓人的。吉尔尽量不去看他们。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Are they aiming at us?" asked Scrubb.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他们是对准我们扔的吗？”斯克罗布问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After about twenty-five minutes the giants apparently had a quarrel. This put an end to the cock-shies, but it is not pleasant to be within a mile of quarrelling giants. They stormed and jeered at one another in long, meaningless words of about twenty syllables each. They foamed and gibbered and jumped in their rage, and each jump shook the earth like a bomb. They lammed each other on the head with great, clumsy stone hammers; but their skulls were so hard that the hammers bounced off again, and then the monster who had given the blow would drop his hammer and howl with pain because it had stung his fingers. But he was so stupid that he would do exactly the same thing a minute later. This was a good thing in the long run, for by the end of an hour all the giants were so hurt that they sat down and began to cry. When they sat down, their heads were below the edge of the gorge, so that you saw them no more; but Jill could hear them howling and blubbering and boo-booing like great babies even after the place was a mile behind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过了大约二十五分钟，巨人们显然吵起来了。掷石头这才结束，但吵架的巨人离他们还不到一英里，这件事可不愉快。他们大发雷霆，互相嘲笑，用的都是没意思的字眼，一个字足足有二十来个音节。他们发脾气时唾沫四溅，叽里咕噜，一跳八丈高，跳一跳就像扔炸弹似的震撼着大地。他们彼此用笨重的大石槌敲打对方的头，但因为他们的脑壳实在太硬，石槌敲下去就再弹开，这时那敲槌子的怪物会扔下槌子，痛得大吼大叫，因为槌子弄痛了他的手指。不过他实在太笨，一分钟以后他又干起同样的事了。这最终倒是件好事，因为玩了一小时，所有的巨人都痛得坐下哭了起来。等他们坐下后，他们的脑袋就在峡谷边缘以下，就看不见他们了。但吉尔还听得见他们像大娃娃似的哇啦哇啦，大哭大叫，即使那地方已在他们后面一英里以外，也还是听得见。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That night they bivouacked on the bare moor, and Puddleglum showed the children how to make the best of their blankets by sleeping back to back. (The backs keep each other warm and you can then have both blankets on top.) But it was chilly even so, and the ground was hard and lumpy. The Marsh-wiggle told them they would feel more comfortable if only they thought how very much colder it would be later on and farther north; but this didn't cheer them up at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天晚上，他们就在光秃秃的荒原上露营，普德格伦做给两个孩子看，怎样背靠背睡，充分利用毯子（背靠背睡，彼此都暖和，而且那样身子上面就可以有两条毯子盖着）。但即使如此仍然是寒气逼人，而且地面硬邦邦，粗糙不平。沼泽怪告诉他们只要他们想想今后再往北走还要冷得多，他们就会感到舒服一点，不过这话一点也没让他们振作起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They travelled across Ettinsmoor for many days, saving the bacon and living chiefly on the moor-fowl (they were not, of course, talking birds) which Eustace and the wiggle shot. Jill rather envied Eustace for being able to shoot; he had learned it on his voyage with King Caspian. As there were countless streams on the moor, they were never short of water. Jill thought that when, in books, people live on what they shoot, it never tells you what a long, smelly, messy job it is plucking and cleaning dead birds, and how cold it makes your fingers. But the great thing was that they met hardly any giants. One giant saw them, but he only roared with laughter and stumped away about his own business.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们在艾丁斯荒原走了好多天，省下熏肉，主要以荒原上野禽为生（当然不是会说话的鸟禽），那都是尤斯塔斯和沼泽怪打来的。吉尔挺妒忌尤斯塔斯会射箭，他当初跟凯斯宾国王航行途中学到了这一手。因为荒原上有数不清的小溪，他们倒一点也不缺水喝。吉尔心想，书里写人们靠打野物为生，从来就没告诉你，把那些死鸟拔毛，洗净是件多臭多脏，多耗时费力的活儿，而且弄得你手指冰冷。但值得庆幸的是他们不大碰见巨人。有一个巨人看见他们了，但他只是大笑了一阵，就噔噔噔地走开，去忙自己的事了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">About the tenth day, they reached a place where the country changed. They came to the northern edge of the moor and looked down a long, steep slope into a different, and grimmer, land. At the bottom of the slope were cliffs: beyond these, a country of high mountains, dark precipices, stony valleys, ravines so deep and narrow that one could not see far into them, and rivers that poured out of echoing gorges to plunge sullenly into black depths. Needless to say, it was Puddleglum who pointed out a sprinkling of snow on the more distant slopes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大约第十天，他们到了一个地形变化的地方。他们来到荒原北部边缘，俯临一片陡峭的长坡，一直通向一片不同的、更可怕的土地。山坡底下就是悬崖，只见那边高山重叠，茫茫一片，黑沉沉的峭壁，乱石丛生的山谷，幽谷又深又狭，看不见底。几条河从回声隆隆的峡谷里倾泻而出，冲入漆黑的深渊。不用说，还是普德格伦，指出更远的山坡上有点儿雪。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"What about that?" said Scrubb suddenly, pointing upstream to their left. Then they all looked and saw the last thing they were expecting -- a bridge. And what a bridge, too! It was a huge, single arch that spanned the gorge from cliff-top to cliff-top; and the crown of that arch was as high above the cliff-tops as the dome of St Paul's is above the street.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那个怎么样？”斯克罗布突然说，一面指着他们左面河的上流。于是大家都往那边看，瞧见了他们决没有料想到的东西——一座桥。这座桥真是鬼斧神工！是一座其大无比的单拱桥，横跨峡谷，从那边悬崖顶上通往这边的悬崖顶上，而且桥拱顶端耸立在两边悬崖顶部上空，就像圣保罗教堂的圆屋顶耸立在街道上空一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“但这桥会不会是别种巨人造的呢？”吉尔说，“我意思是说，生活在几百年前的巨人们造的，那些巨人比现代这种聪明得多。可能就是建造我们正在寻找的巨人城的那种巨人造的。而那样一来就说明我们这一路走对了——老桥通往老城嘛。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When they reached the top and could look down the farther slope of the bridge, they saw what looked like the remains of an ancient giant road stretching away before them into the heart of the mountains. Many stones of its pavement were missing and there were wide patches of grass between those that remained. And riding towards them on that ancient road were two people of normal grown-up human size.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们到了桥顶，才能往下看远处的桥坡，只见有条看上去像是古代巨人的大路的遗迹从他们面前伸展开去，直至群山腹地。路面好多石头都没有了，残留的石头之间是大片大片的野草。在这条古道上有两个正常身材的成人正骑马向他们驰来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So they turned and went to the bridge. And when they reached it, it certainly seemed solid enough. The single stones were as big as those at Stonehenge and must have been squared by good masons once, though now they were cracked and crumbled. The balustrade had apparently been covered with rich carvings, of which some traces remained; mouldering faces and forms of giants, minotaurs, squids, centipedes, and dreadful gods. Puddleglum still didn't trust it, but he consented to cross it with the children.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是他们转身向桥走去。他们走到桥边，只见那座桥的确够结实的。那一块块石头都有史前巨石群①的石头那么大，而且当初一定是由能工巧匠切割成方块的，然而现在都已裂痕累累了。桥栏上以前显然满是富丽的雕刻，如今还留有一些痕迹，残破的脸部和形态，有巨人，有牛头怪，有大乌贼鱼，有娱蛤，还有一些可怕的神像。普德格伦虽然对这座桥还不放心，但他答应跟两个孩子一起过桥。（注：①英国索尔兹伯里平原上。）">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The climb up to the crown of the arch was long and heavy. In many places the great stones had dropped out, leaving horrible gaps through which you looked down on the river foaming thousands of feet below. They saw an eagle fly through under their feet. And the higher they went, the colder it grew, and the wind blew so that they could hardly keep their footing. It seemed to shake the bridge.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爬上桥顶的路又长又难走。好多地方的大石块都掉了，留下一道道吓人的裂口，从裂口往下看，只见几千英尺以下的河里浪花四溅。他们看见一只鹰从他们脚下飞过。而且他们越往上走就越冷，风吹得他们几乎站也站不稳，似乎桥都在摇晃。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Lady laughed: the richest, most musical laugh you can imagine. "Well, children," she said, "you have a wise, solemn old guide with you. I think none the worse of him for keeping his own counsel, but I'll be free with mine. I have often heard the name of the giantish City Ruinous, but never met any who would tell me the way thither. This road leads to the burgh and castle of Harfang, where dwell the gentle giants. They are as mild, civil, prudent, and courteous as those of Ettinsmoor are foolish, fierce, savage, and given to all beastliness. And in Harfang you may or may not hear tidings of the City Ruinous, but certainly you shall find good lodgings and merry hosts. You would be wise to winter there, or, at the least, to tarry certain days for your ease and refreshment. There you shall have steaming baths, soft beds, and bright hearths; and the roast and the baked and the sweet and the strong will be on the table four times in a day."</div>

<div class="line_en">And now they nearly had the first of those quarrels which Puddleglum had foretold: not that Jill and Scrubb hadn't been sparring and snapping at each other a good deal before, but this was the first really serious disagreement. Puddleglum didn't want them to go to Harfang at all. He said that he didn't know what a giant's idea of being "gentle" might be, and that, anyway, Aslan's signs had said nothing about staying with giants, gentle or otherwise. The children, on the other hand, who were sick of wind and rain, and skinny fowl roasted over campfires, and hard, cold earth to sleep on, were absolutely dead set to visit the Gentle Giants. In the end, Puddleglum agreed to do so, but only on one condition. The others must give an absolute promise that, unless he gave them leave, they would not tell the Gentle Giants that they came from Narnia or that they were looking for Prince Rilian. And they gave him this promise, and went on.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the second place, whatever the Lady had intended by telling them about Harfang, the actual effect on the children was a bad one. They could think about nothing but beds and baths and hot meals and how lovely it would be to get indoors. They never talked about Aslan, or even about the lost prince, now. And Jill gave up her habit of repeating the signs over to herself every night and morning. She said to herself, at first, that she was too tired, but she soon forgot all about it. And though you might have expected that the idea of having a good time at Harfang would have made them more cheerful, it really made them more sorry for themselves and more grumpy and snappy with each other and with Puddleglum.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二，不管那夫人告诉两个孩子哈方的事出于什么用意，实际上对他们反而起了坏作用。他们一心只想到床铺、洗澡和热饭热菜，想到屋里该有多舒服，别的什么都不想。如今，他们从来不谈起阿斯兰，甚至对失踪的王子也绝口不提。吉尔也放弃了她每天早晚暗自背诵指示的习惯。开头，她对自己说，我太累了，可是她很快就把这事完全抛在脑后。你可能以为他们想到在哈方可以过得愉快，心里就会高兴一点，其实这反而使他们更为自己难过，他们彼此之间也好，对普德格伦也好，都变得更暴躁，容易上火。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After that talk with the Lady things got worse in two different ways. In the first place the country was much harder. The road led through endless, narrow valleys down which a cruel north wind was always blowing in their faces. There was nothing that could be used for firewood, and there were no nice little hollows to camp in, as there had been on the moor. And the ground was all stony, and made your feet sore by day and every bit of you sore by night.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Look! Look!" cried Jill, and pointed across the plain; and there, through the gathering dusk, from beyond the flat hill, everyone saw lights. Lights!

But they had a hot meal and a fire, and started the night warmer than they had been for over a week. After the fire had gone out, the night grew bitterly cold, and when they woke next morning, their blankets were stiff with frost.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哈方I”斯克罗布和吉尔叫了起来，声音又高兴又激动。“哈方！”普德格伦也说了一遍，声音单调，阴郁。但它又说，“嗨！野鹅！”并立刻拿起了弓。它打中了二只大肥鹅。当天想要到达哈方，已经太晚了。但他们吃了一顿热的，还生了一堆火。这天晚上开头倒比以往这一个多星期都暖和得多。火灭了以后，夜里变得寒意刺骨，等他们第二天早上醒来，毯子全都是霜，冻得硬邦邦的。">查看中文翻译</div>
