<div class="line_en">When I awoke it was past eleven, and Clarice must have come in and brought me my tea without my hearing her, for there was a tray by my side, and a stone-cold teapot, and my clothes had been tidied, my blue frock put away in the wardrobe.</div>

<div class="line_en">I think I fell asleep a little after seven. It was broad daylight, I remember, there was no longer any pretence that the drawn curtains hid the sun. The light streamed in at the open window and made patterns on the wall. I heard the men below in the rose-garden clearing away the tables and the chairs, and taking down the chain of fairy lights. Maxim's bed was still bare and empty. I lay across my bed, my arms over my eyes, a strange, mad position and the least likely to bring sleep, but I drifted to the borderline of the unconscious and slipped over it at last.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我大概是在七点以后不久睡着的，记得那时天已大亮，所以不必再自欺欺人地以为拉上了窗帷就能把阳光挡住。日光从洞开着的窗户射进来，大墙上交织成一幅幅的图案。我听到仆人正在下面玫瑰园里忙着收拾桌椅，并取下那串彩色小灯泡。迈克西姆的床仍旧空着。我伸开四肢，舒服地躺在床上，用胳臂蒙着眼睛。这种奇特而不成体统的姿势似乎最不可能催人入眠，然而我却昏昏沉沉地接近迷糊之境，最后总算堕入了梦乡。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I drank my cold tea, still blurred and stupid from my short heavy sleep, and stared at the blank wall in front of me. Maxim's empty bed brought me to realization with a queer shock to my heart, and the full anguish of the night before was upon me once again. He had not come to bed at all. His pyjamas lay folded on the turned-down sheet untouched. I wondered what Clarice had thought when she came into the room with my tea. Had she noticed? Would she have gone out and told the other servants, and would they all discuss it over their breakfast?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一觉虽短，却很酣沉。我喝着凉茶，睡意仍未全消，睡眼惺松地瞅着前面的空白墙壁。迈克西姆的空床使我猛然清醒过来，心头莫名其妙地一惊，前一夜的极度痛苦再次向我袭来。他根本没有上床睡觉。他的睡衣睡裤放在铺开的床单上，折得好好的，没人碰过。我暗自纳闷，克拉丽斯刚才进屋给我送茶时不知作何感想。她注意到了吗？出去以后有没有告诉其他仆人？他们会不会一边吃着早饭，一边津津有味地议论这事？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I wondered why I minded that, and why the thought of the servants talking about it in the kitchen should cause me such distress. It must be that I had a small mean mind, a conventional, petty hatred of gossip.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我不知道自己为何对这一点老是斤斤计较；为什么一想到仆人们会在厨下窃窃私议就感到这么苦恼不安。一定是我这个人气量小，心地窄，脑筋古板，受不了别人的半句闲话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That was why I had come down last night in my blue dress and had not stayed hidden in my room. There was nothing brave or fine about it, it was a wretched tribute to convention. I had not come down for Maxim's sake, for Beatrice's, for the sake of Manderley. I had come down because I did not want the people at the ball to think I had quarrelled with Maxim. I didn't want them to go home and say, "Of course you know they don't get on. I hear he's not at all happy." I had come for my own sake, my own poor personal pride. As I sipped my cold tea I thought with a tired bitter feeling of despair that I would be content to live in one corner of Manderley and Maxim in the other so long as the outside world should never know. If he had no more tenderness for me, never kissed me again, did not speak to me except on matters of necessity, I believed I could bear it if I were certain that nobody knew of this but our two selves. If we could bribe servants not to tell, play our part before relations, before Beatrice, and then when we were alone sit apart in our separate rooms, leading our separate lives.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="昨晚上我之所以最终换上了那件蓝衣裙下了楼，而没有躲在自己房里，也是这个缘故。这里面谈不上什么勇敢或高尚，仅仅是受了习俗虚礼的驱使，一心想委屈求全罢了。我之所以毅然下楼，并不是为迈克西姆着想，也不是为了比阿特丽斯或曼陀丽。我下楼来乃是因为我不想让参加舞会的宾客以为我和迈克西姆在翻脸怄气。我不想给他们话柄，好让这些人回家去风言风语：“不说你也知道，他俩合不来，听说他生活得一点不快活。”我完全是为了自己，为了顾全自己那份可怜的自尊才下楼去的。我一口一口呷着凉茶，怀着既疲惫又痛苦的绝望心情想着：只要永远不让外人知道，那末即使我住曼陀丽这一隅，迈克西姆住庄园那一角，我也心甘情愿。哪怕他不再对我存有半点温情，不再亲吻我，非到万不得已时不启口对我说话，我相信我也能忍受得住，只要除我俩以外确实没有别人知道其中底蕴。只要我们能用钱堵住仆人的嘴巴，那我们可以在亲朋面前，在比阿特丽斯面前强颜欢笑，扮演恩爱夫妻的角色，到只剩下我们两人的时候，尽可以分道扬镳，各回各的空房，各过各的生活。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I was too young for Maxim, too inexperienced, and, more important still, I was not of his world. The fact that I loved him in a sick, hurt, desperate way, like a child or a dog, did not matter. It was not the sort of love he needed. He wanted something else that I could not give him, something he had had before. I thought of the youthful almost hysterical excitement and conceit with which I had gone into this marriage, imagining I would bring happiness to Maxim, who had known much greater happiness before. Even Mrs Van Hopper, with her cheap views and common outlook, had known I was making a mistake. "I'm afraid you will regret it," she said. "I believe you are making a big mistake."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对迈克西姆来说，我太年轻，太没有生活经验，而更重要的是，我不属于他生活的那个圈子。我像个孩子那样，像条狗那样，病态地、屈辱地、不顾一切地爱着他，但这无济于事。他所需要的不是这样一种爱情，他需要的是我无法给予的别种东西，是他以前曾领受过的另一种爱。我想起自己在结下这宗姻缘时，心里曾涌起一股近乎歇斯底里的青春激情和自负感，以为自己能给曾体验过巨大幸福的迈克西姆带来幸福。甚至连头脑平庸、见识肤浅的范—霍珀夫人也知道我这一步走错了。“恐怕你日后会吃后悔药的，”她说，“我觉得你正铸成大错。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It seemed to me, as I sat there in bed, staring at the wall, at the sunlight coming in at the window, at Maxim's empty bed, that there was nothing quite so shaming, so degrading as a marriage that had failed. Failed after three months, as mine had done. For I had no illusions left now, I no longer made any effort to pretend. Last night had shown me too well. My marriage was a failure. All the things that people would say about it if they knew, were true. We did not get on. We were not companions. We were not suited to one another.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我多么痴呆地坐在床上，望着墙壁，望着窗口射进来的阳光，望着迈克西姆的空床，似乎觉得世上再没有什么比婚姻破裂更使人丢脸，更使人抬不起头来的事了。结婚才三个月，夫妻就反目了。此刻，我已不存半点幻想，不再矫情虚饰。通过昨天晚上的那一幕，我全看明白了。我的婚姻是极大的失败。人们倘若知道真相定会议论纷纷，那些闲话也不一定全是捕风捉影。我们确实合不来，确实不是理想的伴侣。我俩并不相配。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I would not listen to her, I thought her hard and cruel. But she was right. She was right in everything. That last mean thrust thrown at me before she said goodbye, "You don't flatter yourself he's in love with you, do you? He's lonely, he can't bear that great empty house," was the sanest, most truthful statement she had ever made in her life. Maxim was not in love with me, he had never loved me. Our honeymoon in Italy had meant nothing at all to him, nor our living here together. What I had thought was love for me, for myself as a person, was not love. It was just that he was a man, and I was his wife and was young, and he was lonely. He did not belong to me at all, he belonged to Rebecca. He still thought about Rebecca. He would never love me because of Rebecca. She was in the house still, as Mrs Danvers had said; she was in that room in the west wing, she was in the library, in the morning-room, in the gallery above the hall. Even in the little flower-room, where her mackintosh still hung.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这番话我哪听得进去，只觉得她为人冷酷无情，而实际上她的话是对的。她在所有事情上都是对的。她临别时朝我劈头刺来的那卑鄙的最后一击，是她一生中所发表的最剀切入理的箴言：“你不会自欺欺人地以为他爱着你吧？他形影相吊，没法忍受那幢人去楼空的大宅。”迈克西姆当时没爱着我，以后也没爱过我。我们在意大利度过的蜜月，他根本不当一回事情；我们在这儿朝夕相伴的生活，对他也味同嚼蜡。我所认为的那种对我的爱，对我自己作为独立个人的爱，其实并非是什么爱，只不过他是一个男人，而我是他的妻室，也还年轻，再说，他也感到寂寞。他根本不属于我，而是属于吕蓓卡的。他仍眷恋者吕蓓卡。由于吕蓓卡的缘故，他决不会爱我。丹弗斯太太说得不错，吕蓓卡仍在这幢宅子里，在西厢的那个房间里，在藏书室、展室以及大厅上方的画廊里，甚至还在那间小小的花房里——那儿仍挂着她的胶布雨衣。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And in the garden, and in the woods, and down in the stone cottage on the beach. Her footsteps sounded in the corridors, her scent lingered on the stairs. The servants obeyed her orders still, the food we ate was the food she liked. Her favourite flowers filled the rooms. Her clothes were in the wardrobes in her room, her brushes were on the table, her shoes beneath the chair, her nightdress on her bed. Rebecca was still mistress of Manderley.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吕蓓卡还在花园里，在林子中，在海滩的小石屋里。走廊里仍回响着她轻盈的脚步声，楼梯上还留着她身上散发的余香。仆人们仍在按她的吩咐行事：我们吃的是她喜欢的食物，她心爱的花卉摆满各个房间。她的衣饰犹在她房间的衣柜里，她的发刷仍搁在梳妆台上，她的鞋子还搁在椅子下面，睡衣还摊在她床上。吕蓓卡依然是曼陀丽的女主人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="当我在弗兰克面前提起她的时候，他沉吟不语，显得局促不安，对我连珠炮似的那一大串问题避之唯恐不及，其实我自己也讨厌那些问题；而在我们快走近屋子时，他用低沉而平静的声调回答了我的最后一个问题：“不错，她是我有生以来见过的最美的女人。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Rebecca, always Rebecca. Wherever I walked in Manderley, wherever I sat, even in my thoughts and in my dreams, I met Rebecca. I knew her figure now, the long slim legs, the small and narrow feet. Her shoulders, broader than mine, the capable clever hands. Hands that could steer a boat, could hold a horse. Hands that arranged flowers, made the models of ships, and wrote "Max from Rebecca" on the fly-leaf of a book. I knew her face too, small and oval, the clear white skin, the cloud of dark hair. I knew the scent she wore, I could guess her laughter and her smile. If I heard it, even among a thousand others, I should recognize her voice. Rebecca, always Rebecca. I should never be rid of Rebecca.</div>

<div class="line_en">Perhaps I haunted her as she haunted me; she looked down on me from the gallery as Mrs Danvers had said, she sat beside me when I wrote my letters at her desk. That mackintosh I wore, that handkerchief I used. They were hers. Perhaps she knew and had seen me take them. Jasper had been her dog, and he ran at my heels now. The roses were hers and I cut them. Did she resent me and fear me as I resented her? Did she want Maxim alone in the house again? I could fight the living but I could not fight the dead. If there was some woman in London that Maxim loved, someone he wrote to, visited, dined with, slept with, I could fight with her. We would stand on common ground. I should not be afraid. Anger and jealousy were things that could be conquered. One day the woman would grow old or tired or different, and Maxim would not love her any more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她阴魂不散，老是缠着我，说不定我也同样使她日夜不得安宁；正如丹弗斯太太所说，她正从画廊上俯视着我，而当我伏在她书桌上写信时，她就坐在我身边。我穿过的那件雨衣，我用过的那方手绢，都是她的遗物。说不定她不仅知道，而且还看着我将它们拿在手里。杰斯珀原是她的爱犬，现在却因在我脚边打转。玫瑰花是她亲手栽植的，如今却任我剪摘。不错，我恨她，她是不是也同样恨我，怕我？她是不是有意要让迈克西姆再次成为单鹄寡凫，在这屋子里鳏居呢？我可以同活人拚搏，却无法与死人争斗。假如迈克西姆在伦敦有个什么情妇，他给她写信，去看望她，和她同桌吃饭，同榻而眠，那我还可以同她较量一番，因为毕竟都是一样的活人。我不会胆怯气馁。怒火和妒火是可以加以平息的。有朝一日，那女人年老色衰，或是厌腻变了心，迈克西姆就不会再爱她。">查看中文翻译</div>

The tall shrubs looked dark and drab now that the colour had gone. A fog was rolling up from the sea, and I could not see the woods beyond the bank. It was very hot, very oppressive. I could imagine our guests of last night saying to one another, "What a good thing this fog kept off for yesterday, we should never have seen the fireworks." I went out of the morning-room and through the drawing-room to the terrace. The sun had gone in now behind a wall of mist. It was as though a blight had fallen upon Manderley taking the sky away and the light of the day.

The mist in the trees had turned to moisture and dripped upon my bare head like a thin rain. Jasper stood by my feet dejected, his tail downcast, his pink tongue hanging from his mouth. The clammy oppression of the day made him listless and heavy. I could hear the sea from where I stood, sullen and slow, as it broke in the coves below the woods. The white fog rolled on past me towards the house smelling of damp salt and seaweed. I put my hand on Jasper's coat. It was wringing wet. When I looked back at the house I could not see the chimneys or the contour of the walls, I could only see the vague substance of the house, the windows in the west wing, and the flower tubs on the terrace. The shutter had been pulled aside from the window of the large bedroom in the west wing, and someone was standing there, looking down upon the lawns. The figure was shadowy and indistinct and for one moment of shock and fear I believed it to be Maxim. Then the figure moved, I saw the arm reach up to fold the shutter, and I knew it was Mrs Danvers. She had been watching me as I stood at the edge of the woods bathed in that white wall of fog. She had seen me walk slowly from the terrace to the lawns. She may have listened to my conversation with Frank on the telephone from the connecting line in her own room. She would know that Maxim had not been with me last night. She would have heard my voice, known about my tears. She knew the part I had played through the long hours, standing by Maxim's side in my blue dress at the bottom of the stairs, and that he had not looked at me nor spoken to me. She knew because she had meant it to happen. This was her triumph, hers and Rebecca's.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他伫立片刻，然后碰了一下帽檐向我致意，推起车子走了。我穿过草坪，来到林子边上。村从里的雾气凝作水滴，蒙蒙细雨似地飘落在我没戴帽子的头上。杰斯珀耷拉着尾巴，拖着粉红色的舌头，灰溜溜地站在我脚边。阴湿、闷热的天气使它快快不乐，打不起精神来。从我站着的地方，可以听到阴郁、低沉的涛声，此时海水正冲刷着树林下边的小海湾。白色的迷雾散发着盐卤和海藻的涩味儿，打我身边飘过，成团地向屋子那儿滚滚而去。我把手搁在杰斯珀的号衣上，那号衣湿漉漉的，绞得出水来。我回头向屋子一望，不料已看不清屋顶上的烟囱和四周墙壁的轮廓，只是影影绰绰地看到那儿有幢宅子，依稀辨认出西厢的那一排窗户，还有平台上的那几只花盆。我发现西厢那间大卧室的百叶窗已被拉开，有个人站在窗口，望着下面的草坪。那个人影很模糊，我看不清是谁；我心头猛然一惊，一时以为那定是迈克西姆。就在这时候，只见那人一抬胳臂把百叶窗关上。这下子我可认出来了，是丹弗斯太太。这么说来，当我站在树林边上，沐浴在这片白茫茫的浓雾里的时候，她始终在一旁窥探。在这之前，她曾看我拖着缓慢的步子，从平台走向草坪。说不定我跟弗兰克通电话的时候，她就凑在自己房里的电话分机上偷听呢。这一来，她肯定知道迈克西姆昨晚没跟我在一起了。她还可能听到我刚才的呜咽声，知道我在掉眼泪。她知道我昨晚一连好几个小时里扮演的是什么角色；穿着那件蓝色袍子，在楼梯脚下和迈克西姆并排站着；她也知道迈克西姆没朝我看一眼，没跟我说一句话。她当然一清二楚，因为这一切正是她一手安排的。这是她的胜利；这回她和吕蓓卡两人得胜了。">查看中文翻译</div>

What do you think it's meant to me all these months knowing that you wrote at her desk in the morning-room, using the very pen that she used, speaking down the house telephone, where she used to speak every morning of her life to me, ever since she first came to Manderley? What do you think it meant to me to hear Frith and Robert and the rest of the servants talking about you as 'Mrs de Winter'? 'Mrs de Winter has gone out for a walk.' 'Mrs de Winter wants the car this afternoon at three o'clock.' 'Mrs de Winter won't be in to tea till five o'clock.' And all the while my Mrs de Winter, my lady with her smile and her lovely face and brave ways, the real Mrs de Winter, lying dead and cold and forgotten in the church crypt. If he suffers then he deserves to suffer, marrying a young girl like you not ten months afterwards. Well, he's paying for it now, isn't he? I've seen his face, I've seen his eyes. He's made his own hell and there's no one but himself to thank for it. He knows she sees him, he knows she comes by night and watches him. And she doesn't come kindly, not she, not my lady. She was never one to stand mute and still and be wronged. 'I'll see them in hell, Danny,' she'd say, 'I'll see them in hell first.' 'That's right, my dear," I'd tell her, "no one will put upon you. You were born into this world to take what you could out of it', and she did, she didn't care, she wasn't afraid. She had all the courage and spirit of a boy, had my Mrs de Winter.

She drove a four-in-hand on her fourteenth birthday, and her cousin, Mr Jack, got up on the box beside her and tried to take the reins from her hands.

"No one got the better of her, never, never," she said. "She did what she liked, she lived as she liked. She had the strength of a little lion too. I remember her at sixteen getting up on one of her father's horses, a big brute of an animal too, that the groom said was too hot for her to ride. She stuck to him, all right. I can see her now, with her hair flying out behind her, slashing at him, drawing blood, digging the spurs into his side, and when she got off his back he was trembling all over, full of froth and blood. 'That will teach him, won't it, Danny?' she said, and walked off to wash her hands as cool as you please. And that's how she went at life, when she grew up. I saw her, I was with her. She cared for nothing and for no one. And then she was beaten in the end. But it wasn't a man, it wasn't a woman. The sea got her. The sea was too strong for her. The sea got her in the end."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“撒谎！”她说。“除了你，还会有谁呢？这儿再没有别的人了。那天弗里思和罗伯特全不在，其他的仆人没有一个知道。当时我就决计要教训你一下，也要给他点颜色看看。我对自己说：让他受点儿苦。我有什么要顾忌的？他受苦与我何干？为什么我不能在曼陀丽见杰克先生？现在，在我和德温特夫人之间，就只剩下他这样一根纽带了。而他竟对我说：‘我不许他跨进这儿的门槛。这是我最后一次警告你了。’他直到今天还没忘记嫉妒，不是吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I never told him," I said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我从来没对他讲过，”我说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He was jealous while she lived, and now he's jealous when she's dead," said Mrs Danvers. "He forbids Mr Jack the house now like he did then. That shows you he's not forgotten her, doesn't it? Of course he was jealous. So was I. So was everyone who knew her. She didn't care. She only laughed. 'I shall live as I please, Danny,' she told me, 'and the whole world won't stop me.' A man had only to look at her once and be mad about her. I've seen them here, staying in the house, men she'd meet up in London and bring for weekends. She would take them bathing from the boat, she would have a picnic supper at her cottage in the cove. They made love to her of course; who would not? She laughed, she would come back and tell me what they had said, and what they'd done. She did not mind, it was like a game to her. Like a game. Who wouldn't be jealous? They were all jealous, all mad for her. Mr de Winter, Mr Jack, Mr Crawley, everyone who knew her, everyone who came to Manderley."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“她活着的时候他就嫉妒，现在她死了，他还在嫉妒，”丹弗斯太太接着说。“他那时不许杰克进这所屋子，现在还是不许。这说明他还没有把她忘掉，是吗？不用说，他在嫉妒。我也嫉妒呢！所有认识她的人全都在嫉妒。她才不管呢。她对此只是付之一笑。‘我爱怎么生活就怎么生活，丹尼，’她对我说。‘全世界的人都站出来也拦不住我。’男人只要看她一眼，就会爱她爱得发狂。我见到过那些她在伦敦结识的男人，她带他们到这儿来度周末。她带着他们上船，到海里去游泳，在海湾的小屋举行月夜野餐。他们当然向她求爱罗，谁能例外呢？她乐啦，回来就把他们的一言一行和一举一动讲给我听。她满不在乎，对她来说无非是逢场作戏，闹着玩的。谁能不嫉妒呢？他们全都嫉妒，全都被她迷得神魂颠倒。德温特先生，杰克先生，克劳利先生，每一个认识她的人，每一个上曼陀丽来的人。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你为什么不走开？”她说。“我们这儿谁也不需要你。他不需要你，他从来也不需要你。他忘不了她。他需要的是再让他一个人呆在这所屋子里，和她朝夕相处。躺在教堂墓地里的应该是你，而不是德温特夫人。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Don't be afraid," said Mrs Danvers. "I won't push you. I won't stand by you. You can jump of your own accord. What's the use of your staying here at Manderley? You're not happy.

<div class="line_en">I could see the flower tubs on the terrace and the blue of the hydrangeas clumped and solid. The paved stones were smooth and grey. They were not jagged and uneven. It was the fog that made them look so far away. They were not far really, the window was not so very high.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我可以看到平台上的花盆，蓝色的绣球花开得密无缝隙。铺在平台上的石块显得平滑、灰白，而不是四凹凸凸，参差不齐。是迷雾使那些石块显得如此邈远。实际上，石块离得并不远。窗口并没有高出地面很多。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The fog came thicker than before and the terrace was hidden from me. I could not see the flower tubs any more, nor the smooth paved stones. There was nothing but the white mist about me, smelling of seaweed dank and chill. The only reality was the window-sill beneath my hands and the grip of Mrs Danvers on my left arm. If I jumped I should not see the stones rise up to meet me, the fog would hide them from me. The pain would be sharp and sudden as she said. The fall would break my neck. It would not be slow, like drowning. It would soon be over. And Maxim did not love me. Maxim wanted to be alone again, with Rebecca.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雾更浓了。平台已隐匿不见。再也看不到花盆，看不到铺在平台上的光滑的石块。周围除了一片白茫茫的迷雾，散发着冷涩的海藻味儿的迷雾，什么也看不见。眼前唯一真实可感的便是我手底下的窗台，还有丹弗斯太太紧抓着我左臂的那只手。如果我纵身跳下，我将不会看到石块向我迎面跃来，因为迷雾已将它们淹没。接着，像她说的那样，会突然感到一阵剧痛。摔下去，我的脖子一下子就会被折断。不像溺死那样，要拖很长时间。转眼就会过去的。再说，迈克西姆不爱我。迈克西姆还是希望独自一人，跟吕蓓卡作伴。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I shut my eyes. I was giddy from staring down at the terrace, and my fingers ached from holding to the ledge. The mist entered my nostrils and lay upon my lips rank and sour.

Soon I would not have to think about Rebecca any more…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我闭起双眼，由于长时间凝视底下的庭院，我感到头晕目眩，手指也因为紧抓着窗台的边而痛得发麻。迷雾钻进我的鼻孔，沾着我的嘴唇，又腥又涩，我像是蒙了一条毛毯，又像上了麻醉药，只觉得要窒息。我开始忘掉自己的不幸，忘掉自己如何爱着迈克西姆。我开始忘掉吕蓓卡。再过片刻，我不必再老是想到吕蓓卡了…">查看中文翻译</div>

The glass shivered in its frame. I opened my eyes. I stared at Mrs Danvers. The burst was followed by another, and yet a third and fourth. The sound of the explosions stung the air and the birds rose unseen from the woods around the house and made an echo with their clamour.</div>
