<div class="line_en">"Asleep, yeah, right," said Fred in an undertone, after Hermione bade them goodnight and they were climbing to the next floor. "If Ginny's not lying awake waiting for Hermione to tell her everything they said downstairs then I'm a Flobberworm…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“睡着了，是啊，没错。”弗雷德压低声音说，这时赫敏已经向他们道了晚安，他们正继续往楼上走去。“金妮肯定醒着，等待赫敏把他们在楼下说的话原原本本地告诉她，如果不是这样，我就是一只弗洛伯毛虫…”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mrs. Weasley closed the door behind Harry with a sharp snap. The bedroom looked, if anything, even danker and gloomier than it had on first sight. The blank picture on the wall was now breathing very slowly and deeply, as though its invisible occupant was asleep. Harry put on his pyjamas, took off his glasses, and climbed into his chilly bed while Ron threw Owl Treats up on top of the wardrobe to pacify Hedwig and Pigwidgeon, who were clattering around and rustling their wings restlessly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="韦斯莱夫人在哈利身后重重地把门关上了。卧室看上去要说有什么不一样的话，倒是比第一次见到时更加昏暗、更加阴森了。墙上那幅空白油画此刻缓缓地、一起一伏地呼吸着，似乎住在里头的那个看不见的人已经进入了梦乡。哈利换上睡衣，摘下眼镜，爬到冰凉的床上；罗恩往衣柜顶上扔了一些猫头鹰食，安抚一下海德薇和小猪，它们不停地咂着嘴，焦躁地扑扇着翅膀。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"We can't let them out to hunt every night," Ron explained as he pulled on his maroon pyjamas. "Dumbledore doesn't want too many owls swooping around the square, thinks it'll look suspicious. Oh yeah… I forgot…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们不能每天晚上放它们出去捕食。”罗恩一边穿上他的褐紫红色睡衣，一边解释说，“邓布利多不想让太多的猫头鹰在广场上飞来飞去，认为那样会显得很可疑。哦，对了…我忘记了…”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="哈利不需要询问罗恩的问话是什么意思。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, they didn't tell us much we couldn't have guessed, did they?" he said, thinking of all that had been said downstairs. "I mean, all they've really said is that the Order's trying to stop people joining Vol --"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Kreacher," said Ron as he turned off the light. "First night I was here he came wandering in at three in the morning. Trust me, you don't want to wake up and find him prowling around your room. Anyway…" He got into his bed, settled down under the covers, then turned to look at Harry in the darkness. Harry could see his outline by the moonlight filtering in through the grimy window, "what d'you reckon?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“克利切，”罗恩一边关灯一边说道，“我来这里的第一天夜里，他凌晨三点钟摸进了我的房间。相信我，你总不愿意醒过来看见他在你的房间里鬼鬼祟祟地转悠吧。不管怎么说…”他爬到床上，钻进被窝，转过脸在黑暗中望着哈利。哈利就着从肮脏的窗户中透进来的月光，勉强能够分辨出罗恩的轮廓。“你是怎么想的？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Mum," said George and without further ado there was a loud crack and Harry felt the weight vanish from the end of his bed. A few seconds later, they heard the floorboard creak outside their door; Mrs. Weasley was plainly listening to check whether or not they were talking.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“妈妈。”乔治说，说时迟那时快，随着啪的一声爆响，哈利觉得压在他床上的重量突然消失了。几秒钟后，他们听见门外的地板吱吱嘎嘎地响了起来，韦斯莱夫人显然在听他们是不是还在说话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry was sure he would not be able to fall asleep; the evening had been so packed with things to think about that he fully expected to lie awake for hours mulling it all over. He wanted to continue talking to Ron, but Mrs. Weasley was now creaking back downstairs again, and once she had gone he distinctly heard others making their way upstairs… In fact, many-legged creatures were cantering softly up and down outside the bedroom door, and Hagrid, the Care of Magical Creatures teacher, was saying, "Beauties, aren't they, eh, Harry? We'll be studyin' weapons this term…" and Harry saw that the creatures had cannons for heads and were wheeling to face him… He ducked…</div>

<div class="line_en">Half an hour later, Harry and Ron, who had dressed and breakfasted quickly, entered the drawing room, a long, high-ceilinged room on the first floor with olive-green walls covered in dirty tapestries. The carpet exhaled little clouds of dust every time someone put their foot on it and the long, moss-green velvet curtains were buzzing as though swarming with invisible bees. It was around these that Mrs. Weasley, Hermione, Ginny, Fred, and George were grouped, all looking rather peculiar as they had each tied a cloth over their nose and mouth. Each of them was also holding a large bottle of black liquid with a nozzle at the end.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="半个小时后，哈利和罗恩三下五除二地穿好衣服，吃过早饭，来到了客厅。这是二楼的一个长长的、天花板很高的房问，橄榄绿色的墙壁上挂着肮脏的挂毯。每次有人把脚踩在地毯上，就会扬起一小股灰尘，长长的、黄绿色的天鹅绒窗帘嗡嗡作响，好像里面飞着许多看不见的蜜蜂。韦斯莱夫人、赫敏、金妮、弗雷德和乔治正围在窗帘前面，每人脸上都围着一块布，掩住了鼻子和嘴巴，样子显得特别滑稽。他们每个人手里都拿着一大瓶黑色的液体，瓶口有一个喷嘴。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Cover your faces and take a spray," Mrs. Weasley said to Harry and Ron the moment she saw them, pointing to two more bottles of black liquid standing on a spindle-legged table. "It's Doxycide. I've never seen an infestation this bad -- what that house-elf's been doing for the last ten years --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“把脸蒙住，拿一瓶喷雾剂，”韦斯莱夫人一看见哈利和罗恩就说，一边指着一张细长腿桌子上的两瓶黑色液体，“这是狐猸子灭剂。我从没有见过害虫这样泛滥成灾的——那个家养小精灵这十年来都做什么了——”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry felt as though his stomach had sunk through the dusty carpet. He had not thought about the hearing once since dinner the previous evening; in the excitement of being back with the people he liked best, and hearing everything that was going on, it had completely flown his mind. At Sirius's words, however, the crushing sense of dread returned to him. He stared at Hermione and the Weasleys, all tucking into their sandwiches, and thought how he would feel if they went back to Hogwarts without him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利觉得他的心似乎一下子沉到肮脏的地毯下面去了。自从前一天晚上吃完饭之后，他就再没有想过受审的事。他终于回到了他最喜欢的人身边，听人们讲述着正在发生的事情，这使他非常兴奋，早就把这件事忘到了九霄云外。现在听了小天狼星的话，那种万念俱灰的恐惧感又回来了。他呆呆地望着正在狼吞虎咽吃三明治的赫敏和韦斯莱兄弟，想着如果自己不能跟他们一起回霍格沃茨，该是一种什么滋味。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“别担心。”小天狼星说。哈利抬起头，这才发现小天狼星一直在注视着自己．“我相信他们一定会宣告你无罪的，《国际保密法》里肯定有允许人们为了保全性命而使用魔法的条款。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Fortunately for him, it was a job that required a lot of concentration, as many of the objects in there seemed very reluctant to leave their dusty shelves.

Sirius seized it and smashed it with a heavy book entitled Nature's Nobility: A Wizarding Genealogy. There was a musical box that emitted a faintly sinister, tinkling tune when wound, and they all found themselves becoming curiously weak and sleepy, until Ginny had the sense to slam the lid shut; a heavy locket that none of them could open; a number of ancient seals; and, in a dusty box, an Order of Merlin, First Class, that had been awarded to Sirius's grandfather for "services to the Ministry'.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mrs. Weasley kept them all working very hard over the next few days. The drawing room took three days to decontaminate. Finally, the only undesirable things left in it were the tapestry of the Black family tree, which resisted all their attempts to remove it from the wall, and the rattling writing desk. Moody had not dropped by headquarters yet, so they could not be sure what was inside it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接下来的几天，韦斯莱夫人让他们干得非常辛苦。给客厅消毒花了三天时间。最后，房间里还剩下两件令人不快的东西，一个就是那块布莱克家谱图的挂毯，他们想尽各种办法都不能把它从墙上弄下来，还有就是那个咔啦啦作响的写字台。穆迪还没有顺路来指挥部，所以他们不敢肯定那里面到底是什么东西。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Several times Kreacher sidled into the room and attempted to smuggle things away under his loincloth, muttering horrible curses every time they caught him at it.

<div class="line_en">"It was my father's," said Sirius, throwing the ring into the sack. "Kreacher wasn't quite as devoted to him as to my mother, but I still caught him snogging a pair of my father's old trousers last week."</div>

<div class="line_en">The doorbell rang several times a day, which was the cue for Sirius's mother to start shrieking again, and for Harry and the others to attempt to eavesdrop on the visitor, though they gleaned very little from the brief glimpses and snatches of conversation they were able to sneak before Mrs. Weasley recalled them to their tasks. Snape flitted in and out of the house several times more, though to Harry's relief they never came face to face; Harry also caught sight of his Transfiguration teacher, Professor McGonagall, looking very odd in a Muggle dress and coat, and she also seemed too busy to linger. Sometimes, however, the visitors stayed to help. Tonks joined them for a memorable afternoon in which they found a murderous old ghoul lurking in an upstairs toilet, and Lupin, who was staying in the house with Sirius but who left it for long periods to do mysterious work for the Order, helped them repair a grandfather clock that had developed the unpleasant habit of shooting heavy bolts at passers-by. Mundungus redeemed himself slightly in Mrs. Weasley's eyes by rescuing Ron from an ancient set of purple robes that had tried to strangle him when he removed them from their wardrobe.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每天门铃都要响几次，一听到铃声，小天狼星的母亲就开始刺耳地尖叫，哈利和其他人则努力想偷听来访者的谈话，但每次只能匆匆瞥上几眼，听到几句零散的对话，就被韦斯莱夫人叫回去干活了，根本没有捞到多少有用的情报。斯内普又蜻蜓点水般地来了几次，不过让哈利感到欣慰的是，他们一直没有正面碰见过。哈利还看见了他的变形术老师麦格教授，她穿着麻瓜的衣服和外套，显得十分古怪。她似乎也非常忙碌，来去匆匆。不过，有的时候来访者也会留下来帮忙。唐克斯和他们一起度过了一个难忘的下午，他们在楼上的一间厕所里发现了一只凶恶残忍的老食尸鬼。卢平本来是和小天狼星一起住在房子里的，最近离开了很长时间，为凤凰社做一项秘密工作，但他帮助他们修好了一台老爷钟，那钟不知怎地染上了一个令人讨厌的坏毛病：朝过路人发射硬邦邦的螺丝钉。蒙顿格斯稍微挽回了一些自己在韦斯莱夫人心目中的形象，他把罗恩从一套古怪的紫色长袍里救了出来。当罗恩把袍子从衣柜里拿出来时，袍子缠住了他，要把他勒死。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Snape might refer to their work as "cleaning', but in Harry's opinion they were really waging war on the house, which was putting up a very good fight, aided and abetted by Kreacher. The house-elf kept appearing wherever they were congregated, his muttering becoming more and more offensive as he attempted to remove anything he could from the rubbish sacks. Sirius went as far as to threaten him with clothes, but Kreacher fixed him with a watery stare and said, "Master must do as Master wishes," before turning away and muttering very loudly, "but Master will not turn Kreacher away, no, because Kreacher knows what they are up to, oh yes, he is plotting against the Dark Lord, yes, with these Mudblood and traitors and scum…"</div>

<div class="line_en">Despite the fact that he was still sleeping badly, still having dreams about corridors and locked doors that made his scar prickle, Harry was managing to have fun for the first time all summer. As long as he was busy he was happy; when the action abated, however, whenever he dropped his guard, or lay exhausted in bed watching blurred shadows move across the ceiling, the thought of the looming Ministry hearing returned to him. Fear jabbed at his insides like needles as he wondered what was going to happen to him if he was expelled. The idea was so terrible that he did not dare voice it aloud, not even to Ron and Hermione, who, though he often saw them whispering together and casting anxious looks in his direction, followed his lead in not mentioning it. Sometimes, he could not prevent his imagination showing him a faceless Ministry official who was snapping his wand in two and ordering him back to the Dursleys'… but he would not go. He was determined on that. He would come back here to Grimmauld Place and live with Sirius.</div>
