<div class="line_en">I was woken by the full moon shining in on me, as I had forgotten to draw my curtains. Suddenly, a wild, terrible cry broke the silence, echoing throughout the house. My heart missed a beat. What could it mean? It came from the top floor. Then I heard the sounds of a desperate struggle, just above my room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="由于我忘记拉好窗帘，一轮满月照在我身上，我被弄醒了。突然，一声可怕的狂叫打破了寂静，在整幢房子里回荡。我的心跳都停了。这是怎么回事？声音从顶层传来，接着我听到就在我楼上有死命挣扎的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Help! Help! Help! Come on! Help me! Rochester! Rochester! For God's sake, come on! shouted a voice from upstairs. Bedroom doors were opened as the guests woke up. What's happening?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“救命！救命！救命！来人啊！救救我！罗切斯特！罗切斯特！看在上帝的份上，快来啊！”楼上有人喊着。许多卧室的门打开了，客人们都被吵醒了。“出什么事了？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Here I am!" called the master of the house, descending with a candle from the top floor. "It's all right. Don't be afraid ladles. A servant's had a bad dream, that's all, and started screaming. Nothing to worry abut. Please go back to your rooms. You'll catch cold otherwise." And so he calmed his guests and persuaded them to return to their rooms.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我在这儿！”房子的主人喊道，他拿着蜡烛从顶楼走了下来。“没事儿。女士们，别怕。一个仆人做了噩梦，然后开始喊叫，就这样。没什么好担心的。请回屋吧，不然会着凉的。”他安慰着客人们，把他们劝回屋里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But I know that the voices I hear have nothing to do with the nightmares of any servant. So I put on my clothes and waited in case I needed help. About an hour later, Turnfield was calm again and someone knocked carefully at my door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是我知道我听到的声音跟什么仆人的噩梦毫无关系。于是我穿好衣服，等在屋里，以防要我帮忙。大约一小时后，特恩费得已恢复了平静，有人小心地敲我的门。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“简，你醒着吗？”我期待的声音问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Do you feel faint at the sight of blood?" he asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你见到血晕不晕？”他问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Good, I need you. Come and help me. Bring a clean cloth with you." We went quietly up to the top floor, where he unlocked one of the small black doors.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好，我需要你，来帮帮忙，带上一块干净的布。”我们悄悄走上顶层，他打开了其中的一扇小黑门。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Wait here," said Mr Rochester, and Went into the secret room where a shout of laughter greeted him. Ah, so Grace Poole was there! He came out quickly and closed the secret door. Then he showed me why he needed me. In an armchair lay Mr Mason, his clothes and his arm covered in blood. As we bent over him, he opened his eyes and groaned.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“等在这儿。”罗切斯特说完走进密室，一阵狂笑迎接了他。啊，格丽丝·普尔在里面！他很快退身出来，关上了暗门。然后他指给我为什么他需要我。扶手椅上躺着梅森先生，他的衣服上和手臂上都有血。当我们俯身看他时，他睁开眼睛呻吟着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Am I going to die?" he murmured weakly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我会死吗？”他虚弱地轻声说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don't think so," I replied. We entered a room with curtains hung on the walls. One of the curtains was tied back to reveal a secret door into another small room. From there came an angry growling sound, almost like a dog.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我想不会。”我答道。我们走进屋里，只见帘子挂在墙上，其中一个已卷好，露出一个暗门，通向另一间小屋子。从那儿传出了愤怒的嚎叫声，几乎像一只狗似的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, man, don't be foolish. It's just a scratch," answered Mr Rochester. "Now Jane," he said, turning to me, "have to leave you in this room with Mason while I fetch the doctor. You must wipe away the blood with the damp cloth, like this, and help him to drink a little water. But on no account must you speak to him. Is that understood?"I nodded, and nervously watched him leave the room. I could hear him turning the key in the lock.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不会的，别傻了，不过划伤了一点儿。”罗切斯特说。他转过身来对我交待着：“简，我要你留在屋里陪梅森先生，我去请医生。你必须用湿布擦净血迹，像这样，然后给他喝点儿水。但切莫对他说话，明白吗？”我点点头，害怕地看着他离开了房间，听到他把门锁上了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At last Mr Rochester arrived with the doctor, who cleaned and bandaged Mason's wounds.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="终于，罗切斯特先生带着医生来了，那医生为梅森清洗、包扎了伤口。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Strange!" remarked the doctor, "The skin on the shoulder has been torn by teeth, as well as a knife!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“真奇怪！”医生说，“肩上的伤既有牙咬的，也有刀扎的！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"She bit me, murmured Mason, when Rochester managed to get the knife from her."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="梅森低声说；“罗切斯特夺她手里的刀时，她咬了我。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So here I was, in the middle of the night, locked in with a bleeding, dying man, and a wild, murdering woman only on the other side of a door! It seemed a long night, interrupted only by Mason's groans, and by occasional animal-like noises from the secret room. I had plenty of time to wonder why these violent attacks happened, first the fire in Mr Rochester's room, and now a physical attack on a stranger. And how was Mr Mason involved? Why was he here on the top floor? I had heard his host showing him to a bedroom near mine, on the second floor. And why was Mr Rochester so frightened when Mr Mason came to Thornfield?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是我就这么半夜被锁起来陪伴一个流血不止、就要死去的人，而杀人的疯女人就在门那边！夜显得那么漫长，只有梅森的呻吟和不时从密室里传出的野兽般的声音不时打破长夜。我有许多时间猜测为什么会发生这些暴力事件，先是罗切斯特先生房间着火，现在又是陌生人遭到袭击。梅森先生是怎么卷进来的？他为什么会在顶层呢？我听到主人把他领进二楼我隔壁的卧室的。梅森先生来到特恩费得，为什么罗切斯特先生那么害怕？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, I warned you not to see her alone," said Rochester. "You should have waited till the morning, then we could have seen her together. Don't worry, man, when you get back to the West Indies, you can forget her. Think of her as dead and buried. Now, doctor, is Mason ready to be moved? I have a carriage waiting outside You'll take him home with you to avoid gossip, and then in a few days he'll be fit enough to leave the country."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗切斯特说：“我警告过你不要单独见她。你应该等到早晨，然后我们一起去看她。别担心，伙计，你回到西印度群岛，就可以把她忘掉，就当她死了．被埋掉了。医生，梅森先生能动了吗？我有马车等在外面。你把他带去你家，免生议论，几天后他就可以休养得离开这个国家了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The early sun warmed the bench and the birds were singing. Now, Jane, suppose a boy in a foreign country makes a mistake, not a crime, mind you. The results of this mistake have a terrible effect on his whole life. He comes home after years of suffering, and meets someone, who is fresh and good and pure. Now, can he ignore society, can he forget the past, and live the rest of his life with her in peace?</div>
