<div class="line_en">The doctor, by comparison, was like a balding rodent. He was small and nimble, pacing the school office with his manic yet businesslike movements and mannerisms. And he had a cold.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="站在角落里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She had the thickest braid he'd ever seen. It roped down her back, and occasionally, when she brought it over her shoulder, it lurked at her colossal breast like an overfed pet. In fact, everything about her was magnified. Her lips, her legs. Her paved teeth. She had a large, direct voice. No time to waste. "Komm," she instructed them. "Come. Stand here."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他从来没见过那么粗的辫子。它垂在背后，偶尔也被她挽过肩头，像一头饱食的宠物般埋伏在她硕大的乳房中间。说实话，她全身上下都硕大无比。比如她的嘴唇，她的大腿，她那口犹如铺路石的牙齿。她嗓门很大，说话直来直去，绝不浪费时间。“过来，”她命令他们，“站到这儿来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Out of the three boys, it was difficult to decide which was the more reluctant to take off his clothes when ordered to do so. The first one looked from person to person, from the aging teacher to the gargantuan nurse to the pint-sized doctor. The one in the middle looked only at his feet, and the one on the far left counted his blessings that he was in the school office and not a dark alley. The nurse, Rudy decided, was a frightener.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果被命令脱掉衣服，这三个男孩到底谁会最不情愿呢，这件事真不好说。第一个男孩左瞅瞅右看看，目光扫过年老的教师、大块头护士和瘦小的医生。中间那个男孩始终低着头看着自己的脚，而最左边的那个在感谢上帝，庆幸自己身在学校的办公室，而不是黑暗的小巷。鲁迪心想，这个护士可能是专门来吓唬他们的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was the supervising teacher, Herr Heckenstaller, who answered. He was more a black suit than a man. His face was a mustache. Examining the boys, his choice came swiftly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="回答问题的是训导老师黑肯施塔勒先生。与其说他是个人，不如说他更像是一套西装。他脸上满是胡须。扫了三位男孩一眼后，他飞快地做了选择。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“谁先来？”护士问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The unfortunate Jurgen Schwarz undid his uniform with great discomfort. He was left standing only in his shoes and underwear. A luckless plea was marooned on his German face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="倒霉的尤尔根·施瓦茨只好一脸不自在地开始脱衣服。他脱光了衣服，只剩下鞋子和内裤。这个德国男孩的脸上流露出哀求。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他脱掉了鞋子和袜子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Both Rudy and the other boy, Olaf Spiegel, had started undressing now as well, but they were nowhere near the perilous position of Jurgen Schwarz. The boy was shaking. He was a year younger than the other two, but taller. When his underpants came down, it was with abject humiliation that he stood in the small, cool office. His self-respect was around his ankles.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="鲁迪和另一个男孩奥拉夫·施皮格尔也开始脱衣服了，可是他们还远远比不上尤尔根·施瓦茨的处境危险。那个男孩正在发抖。他比另外两个男孩都小一岁，个子却高出一截。在这间冰冷狭小的办公室里，当内裤也离他而去时，他只感觉到无助与耻辱。他的自尊心已经摔到了脚下。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“现在把手臂张开。”一声咳嗽响起。“我说把手臂张开。”一串剧烈的咳嗽。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As humans do, the boys looked constantly at each other for some sign of mutual sympathy. None was there. All three pried their hands from their penises and held out their arms. Rudy did not feel like he was part of a master race.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="男孩们交换着眼色，试图在彼此的脸上寻找同情的神色，可他们只能面面相觑。三个人都极不情愿地把手从生殖器上移走，然后张开了手臂。鲁迪一点也不觉得自己是优等种族的一员。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Unfortunately, her sermon was cut short when the doctor creased in half and coughed with all his might over the abandoned clothes. Tears welled up in his eyes and Rudy couldn't help but wonder.</div>

<div class="line_en">The day after they'd visited Himmel Street, Rudy sat on his front step with Liesel and related the whole saga, even the smallest details. He gave up and admitted what had happened that day at school when he was taken out of class. There was even some laughter about the tremendous nurse and the look on Jurgen Schwarz's face. For the most part, though, it was a tale of anxiety, especially when it came to the voices in the kitchen and the dead-body dominoes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那一天，在穿大衣的男人拜访过希默尔街后，鲁迪和莉泽尔一起坐在自家前门的台阶上，向她讲述了整则传奇故事，连最细枝末节的桥段都没有放过。在莉泽尔的追问下，他甚至还把那天他被带出教室后发生的事情讲了出来。那个壮硕如牛的护士和尤尔根·施瓦茨的表情都惹得莉泽尔哈哈大笑。然而，这个故事中仍旧弥漫着焦虑的情绪，尤其是厨房里的对话和尸体一般的多米诺骨牌。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"First was you, Schwarz," said Rudy. He then questioned Olaf Spiegel. "Who was third?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“第一个是你，施瓦茨。”鲁迪说道，然后他问奥拉夫·施皮格尔：“第三个是谁？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="被剥夺自尊之后，男孩们现在可以穿上衣服离开办公室了。他们听到了背后关于他们的讨论。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Spiegel made a few calculations. Did she mean third in line or third examined? It didn't matter. He knew what he wanted to believe. "That was you, I think."</div>
