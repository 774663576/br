<div class="line_en">The neighbors are saying he's been "like a different person" these last days, that they've never seen him so "engaged" before. But as Ove irritably explains to them, that's only because Ove has never bloody engaged himself in their particular business before. He's always been a bloody "engaged" person.</div>

<div class="line_en">Patrick says the way he walks between the houses and slams the doors the whole time is like "a really angry avenging robot from the future." Ove doesn't know what he means by that. But, anyway, he's spent hours at a time in the evenings sitting with Parvaneh and Patrick and the girls, while Patrick to the best of his abilities has tried to get Ove not to put angry fingerprints all over Patrick's computer monitor whenever he wants to show them something. Jimmy, Mirsad, Adrian, and Anders have also been there. Jimmy has repeatedly tried to get everyone to call Parvaneh and Patrick's kitchen "The Death Star" and Ove "Darth Ove." They've considered countless plans over the last few days -- including planting marijuana in the white-shirted man's shed, as Rune might have suggested -- but after a few nights Ove seems to give up. He nods grimly, demands to use the telephone, and shuffles off into the next room to make a call.</div>

<div class="line_en">When Parvaneh, with panic in her eyes, runs right into Ove's hall and continues into the bathroom without even bothering to say "Good morning," Ove immediately disputes how one can become so acutely in need of a pee in the space of the twenty seconds it takes her to walk from her own house to his. But "hell has no fury like a pregnant woman in need," Sonja once informed him. So he keeps his mouth shut.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当帕尔瓦娜连声早上好都来不及问候，就瞪着惊恐的大眼睛冲进欧维家大门直奔厕所的时候，欧维当然忍不住想问问，从她家到欧维家那二十秒的路程中能憋住尿，却连问声早安的时间都没有，这究竟是怎么做到的。但欧维的太太曾经教导过欧维：“鬼知道还有什么比着急的孕妇爆发的愤怒更可怕。”于是他抿紧嘴唇。">查看中文翻译</div>

He's brought along three young men in nurse uniforms, as if he's expecting violent resistance.
