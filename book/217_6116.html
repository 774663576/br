<div class="line_en">At first I hated the school, but by and by I got so I could stand it. Whenever I got uncommon tired I played hookey, and the hiding I got next day done me good and cheered me up. So the longer I went to school the easier it got to be. I was getting sort of used to the widow's ways, too, and they warn't so raspy on me. Living in a house and sleeping in a bed pulled on me pretty tight mostly, but before the cold weather I used to slide out and sleep in the woods sometimes, and so that was a rest to me. I liked the old ways best, but I was getting so I liked the new ones, too, a little bit. The widow said I was coming along slow but sure, and doing very satisfactory. She said she warn't ashamed of me.</div>

<div class="line_en">Well, three or four months run along, and it was well into the winter now. I had been to school most all the time and could spell and read and write just a little, and could say the multiplication table up to six times seven is thirty-five, and I don't reckon I could ever get any further than that if I was to live forever. I don't take no stock in mathematics, anyway.</div>

<div class="line_en">I went down to the front garden and clumb over the stile where you go through the high board fence. There was an inch of new snow on the ground, and I seen somebody's tracks. They had come up from the quarry and stood around the stile a while, and then went on around the garden fence. It was funny they hadn't come in, after standing around so. I couldn't make it out. It was very curious, somehow. I was going to follow around, but I stooped down to look at the tracks first. I didn't notice anything at first, but next I did. There was a cross in the left boot-heel made with big nails, to keep off the devil.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我走过了下面屋子的园子，爬上梯子，爬过高高的木栅栏。我看到了在地上寸把厚的积雪上有人留下的脚印。这些人是从采石场走过来的，在梯子旁边站了一会儿，随后绕过园子里的栅栏往前去了。这些人在这里站了一会儿但没有进来，这有点儿奇怪。我可摸不清是怎么回事，反正有点儿蹊跷。我打算顺着脚印走，我弯下身来先看一看脚印，开始并没有发现什么，可是再一看，才发现有一个左边鞋跟上用大钉钉的十字留下的印子，那本是为了防邪才钉上去的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One morning I happened to turn over the salt-cellar at breakfast. I reached for some of it as quick as I could to throw over my left shoulder and keep off the bad luck, but Miss Watson was in ahead of me, and crossed me off. She says, "Take your hands away, Huckleberry; what a mess you are always making!" The widow put in a good word for me, but that warn't going to keep off the bad luck, I knowed that well enough. I started out, after breakfast, feeling worried and shaky, and wondering where it was going to fall on me, and what it was going to be. There is ways to keep off some kinds of bad luck, but this wasn't one of them kind; so I never tried to do anything, but just poked along low-spirited and on the watch-out.</div>

<div class="line_en">Miss Watson's nigger, Jim, had a hair-ball as big as your fist, which had been took out of the fourth stomach of an ox, and he used to do magic with it. He said there was a spirit inside of it, and it knowed everything. So I went to him that night and told him pap was here again, for I found his tracks in the snow. What I wanted to know was, what he was going to do, and was he going to stay? Jim got out his hair-ball and said something over it, and then he held it up and dropped it on the floor. It fell pretty solid, and only rolled about an inch. Jim tried it again, and then another time, and it acted just the same. Jim got down on his knees, and put his ear against it and listened. But it warn't no use; he said it wouldn't talk. He said sometimes it wouldn't talk without money. I told him I had an old slick counterfeit quarter that warn't no good because the brass showed through the silver a little, and it wouldn't pass nohow, even if the brass didn't show, because it was so slick it felt greasy, and so that would tell on it every time. (I reckoned I wouldn't say nothing about the dollar I got from the judge.) I said it was pretty bad money, but maybe the hair-ball would take it, because maybe it wouldn't know the difference. Jim smelt it and bit it and rubbed it, and said he would manage so the hair-ball would think it was good. He said he would split open a raw Irish potato and stick the quarter in between and keep it there all night, and next morning you couldn't see no brass, and it wouldn't feel greasy no more, and so anybody in town would take it in a minute, let alone a hair-ball. Well, I knowed a potato would do that before, but I had forgot it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="华珍小姐的黑奴杰姆从一只牛身上第四个胃里取出来有一个拳头大的毛球。他老是用这个来施展法术。照他说，这里面藏着一个精灵。这个精灵可是无所不知，无所不晓的。我就在一个晚上去找他，告诉他说，我爸又出现在这里了，因为我在雪地里发现了他的脚印。我要问清楚的是，他究竟想干些什么呢，还有他是否要在这里待下去？杰姆取出了毛球对着它口中念念有词，先往上一扔，再落到地上，落得稳稳当当，只滚了寸把远，杰姆又来了二回，然后又来了第三回，情况跟第一回一模一样。杰姆双膝趴地，耳朵凑着毛球，仔细地听着。可是无济于事。他说，它没有说话，还说，在不给它钱的时候就不肯说话。我对他说，我有一枚三角五分的旧伪币，又旧又光滑，已经不能用了，因为银币已经露出一小块铜，反正人家不肯要了。即使没有把铜露了出来，也不好使用，因为旧得象抹上一层油那样油腻腻的，一眼就给看穿了。（我心里想着，法官给我的那块钱，我可不能说啊。）我说，虽然是个伪币，不过毛球也许肯收下，因为它认不出真假。杰姆把伪币闻了闻，咬了咬，擦了擦。他说，他会想个法子，好叫毛球以为这是真的银币。他说可以把一块爱尔兰土豆掰开，把伪币夹在正中间，这样放一个晚上，第二天早上，铜的影子就会消失，也不会油腻腻的了。镇上的人谁都会一眼就收下它，不只是毛球会收。是啊，我原本知道土豆有这个效果，可一下子把这个忘了。">查看中文翻译</div>
