<div class="line_en">If Dennis Cradle is surprised to see Eve when she collects him from his house, he conceals it well. The car is an eight-year-old VW Golf from the MI6 vehicle pool, smelling of stale air-freshener, and Cradle takes his place in the passenger seat without a word. As they drive away Eve switches on the Radio 4 Today programme, and they both pretend to listen to it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看见来家里接自己的是Eve，即使感到惊讶，Dennis Cradle也丝毫没表现出来。接他的车是军情六处车队一辆8年的大众高尔夫，车子透着股陈腐的空气清新剂味道，Cradle一言不发地坐进了副驾驶座。路上Eve打开了4号电台的“今日实事”节目，两人都装作在听。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Cradle remains silent for the duration of the journey to Dever. Initially, Eve reads this as a desperate attempt to assert some sort of authority, given that when she worked at MI5 he was considerably her senior. And then a darker interpretation of his manner strikes her. He's not saying anything because he knows exactly what she's doing here, and so does the organisation he works for. In which case, how much else do they know about her? And for that matter, about Niko? At the thought that her husband might be the object of hostile surveillance, and possibly worse, Eve feels a twisting, agonising guilt. There is no way of avoiding the fact that she's brought this situation on herself. Richard would have understood if she had decided to step down after Simon Mortimer was murdered in Shanghai; indeed, he encouraged her to do so. But she can't, and won't, let go.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="去往Dever市的路上Cradle始终保持着沉默。起初，Eve认为这是他为维护自己权威做出的最后努力，毕竟她在军情五处工作时，他可是她的上级，然而突然，她想到了更为阴暗的解释。他什么也不说，是因为他，以及他效力的组织，都很清楚她在打什么算盘。说到这，他们又对她了解多少了呢？那对Niko呢？一想到自己的丈夫可能是敌人的监视对象，说不定还更糟，Eve心中就翻涌起了强烈的内疚。毋庸置疑，是她亲手把自己推到了这种境地。如果当初在上海Simon Mortimer被杀了后，她决定洗手不干，Richard也完全会理解她的决定，而且他确实有鼓励她退出。但她无法释怀，也不愿放手。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The traffic is heavy leaving London, but Eve is able to make up time on the motorway, and it's just after quarter to nine when she takes the slip road signposted "Works Access Only". The road leads through sparse woodland to a steel gateway set into a high chain-link fence topped with razor-wire. In front of the gate is a guardhouse, where an armed military police corporal checks Eve's security pass before nodding her through the gate towards the cluster of low, weather-stained brick buildings that comprise the former government research station. As Eve drives into the car park, she sees half a dozen tracksuited figures running laps of the fenced perimeter. Others, carrying automatic weapons, saunter between the dilapidated buildings.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="出伦敦市的道路十分拥堵，不过Eve能在高速路上开快些节省时间，当她开到写着“仅限工作人员”的高速出口时不过才九点十五分。驶过稀疏的林地，道路通向了一扇联结着铁丝网高墙的铁门。在门口的警卫室处，一名武装士兵检查了Eve的通行证，然后朝她点点头给她开了门。这扇门通往一栋栋因为日晒雨淋而外观斑驳的低矮砖墙建筑，它们原先都是政府的研究站。开往停车场时，Eve看见六个穿着运动套装的身影正沿着铁丝网墙跑圈，其他人则拿着自动化武器在废弃建筑间晃悠。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In part, it's a desire for answers. Who is the unnamed woman who has carved such a bloody trail through the shadowlands of the intelligence world? Who are her employers, what do they want, and how have they achieved such terrifying power and reach? The mystery, and the woman at the heart of the mystery, speak to a part of Eve that she's never really explored. Could she herself ever be transformed into someone who acts as her target does? Who kills without hesitation or pity? And if so, what would it take?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一部分原因是，对于真相的渴求。这个在情报信息的空白领地间踩出一条血腥之路的神秘女人是谁？谁是她的雇主，他们想要什么，他们又是如何拥有如此骇人强大的实力和关系网的？这些谜团，以及处于谜团中心的这个女人，都仿佛在召唤着Eve从未探寻过的自我。她有可能变成和她追踪的目标一样的人吗，一个毫无怜悯杀人不眨眼的人？如果会的话，代价又是什么？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At the reception block, Eve and Cradle are met by a trooper from E Squadron, the Special Forces unit based at the camp. Casting an eye at Eve's pass, he beckons them to follow him. The interview room is at the end of a strip-lit underground corridor. It's minimally furnished and there are no CCTV cameras in evidence. A trestle table holds an electric kettle, a half-full bottle of mineral water, two stained mugs, a packet of biscuits and a box holding tea bags and sachets of sugar and powdered milk. The room is colder than Eve would have liked, and the air-conditioning gives off a faint, shuddering whirr.</div>

<div class="line_en">Cradle yawns, unhurriedly covering his mouth. "We were on holiday, about three years ago. A tennis camp, near Málaga. There was another couple there from Holland, and Penny and I started playing regularly with them. They told us that their names were Rem and Gaite Bakker, and that they came from Delft, where he was an IT consultant and she was a radiographer. In retrospect I doubt that any of that was the case, but I had no reason not to believe it at the time, and we became quasi-friends, in the way that you do on holiday. Going out for meals together, and so on. Anyway, one evening Penny and Gaite went with some of the other wives on a girls' night out -- flamenco, sangria, all that -- and Rem and I went to a bar in the town. We talked about sport for a bit, he was a big Federer fan, and then we got onto politics."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="Cradle不慌不忙地掩着嘴打了个哈欠。“大概三年前，我们正在西班牙马拉加附近的一个网球村度假。那儿有另一对荷兰来的夫妻，Penny和我就像往常一样跟他们打球。他们告诉我们他们叫Rem和Gaite Bakker，是从荷兰代尔夫特来的。男的是个IT技术咨询师，女的是放射线摄影师。现在回想起来，我怀疑可能都是假话，不过当时我没理由不相信他们。我们变得像朋友一样，就是度假时的玩伴，一起出去吃饭什么的。总之，有个晚上Penny和Gaite跟其他人的妻子们一起出去过女生之夜了——跳跳弗拉明戈舞，喝桑格利亚果酒，诸如此类的——Rem和我去了市区的酒吧。我们聊了会儿体育，他是费德勒的狂热粉丝，然后我们就聊到了政治。”">查看中文翻译</div>

I think we ended the evening talking about wine, which he knew a lot about, and as far as I was concerned it was just one of those pleasant, setting-the-world-to-rights-type evenings that happen on holiday."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我给他说了在家工作的自由职业者那套说辞。不可避免地我们就聊到了移民问题，不过他没有一直纠结政治，我记得我们结束前在讨论酒，他还挺懂这个的，我当时觉得那晚就只是个谈天说地的愉快度假夜罢了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I remember thinking, in an English kind of way, that it was slightly overstepping the mark. That going out for a drink on holiday was one thing, but pursuing the acquaintanceship afterwards quite another, even though we'd gone through the motions of swapping email addresses. At the same time I have to admit that the thought of drinking truly great Burgundy just once in my life was too good a chance to pass up, so I said I'd go."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我记得我当时有些英式思维地在想，这有些过了。度假时一起出去喝酒是一回事，但假期后还想了解对方就是另一回事了，哪怕我们都互相交换了邮箱也是如此。同时我也承认，我当时觉得这好机会绝不能错过，人生中哪怕能喝到一次纯正的顶级勃艮第红酒也好，所以我说我会去的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"And then, a month after we went back home, Rem emailed me. He was over in London for a couple of days, and he wanted me to meet a friend of his. The idea was that the three of us would go to a wine club in Pall Mall, where the friend was a member, and try out a couple of rare vintages. He mentioned, I recall, Richebourg and Echezeaux, which were quite some distance out of my orbit on a Thames House salary, even as a deputy head of section. Did you say you wanted milk and sugar?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Cradle looks around him. The river, its waters moving smoothly towards the rushing weir, has the keen, indefinable smell of such places. Mud, vegetation and rot. There's a timelessness about the scene that reminds him of his childhood. Of The Wind in the Willows, of Ratty, Mole and Toad. And that chapter he never quite understood: "The Piper at the Gates of Dawn". Cradle is pondering this enigma when a police-issue baton, swung with extreme force, connects with the base of his skull. He pitches almost noiselessly into the river. His half-submerged body hangs there for a moment, and then, as Villanelle watches, begins its inexorable drift towards the crest of the weir, where it is immediately drawn deep underwater. She stands there, imagining his body turning and turning in the vortex, far beneath the glassy surface. And then she holsters the baton, and unhurriedly makes her way back along the path.</div>

<div class="line_en">By the time Lance drops her off at her house, Eve is exhausted. She's also furious, apprehensive, and faintly nauseous from the nicotine smell of Lance's car. There's a horrendous conversation with Richard still to be had -- he's coming by the office at 6 p. m. -- but the most shaming admission that Eve has had to make is to herself. How easily, how effortlessly and contemptuously, she has been played. How naive she has been. How utterly unprofessional.</div>

<div class="line_en">Niko compresses his lips, and nods. "As I told you on the phone, Mrs Khan reported seeing a young woman climbing out of our window at about ten thirty this morning, and rang the police. Two police officers called round at the school, picked me up, and drove me here. They were obviously taking the whole thing quite seriously, because there was a forensics person waiting outside when we got back. Perhaps they've got our address on file because of your old job at MI5, who knows? Anyway, they went through the flat with me, room by room, and the forensics woman did her stuff on the door handles and the front room window and various other surfaces, looking for fingerprints, but she found nothing. She told me the intruder must have been wearing gloves. She'd undone the window lock, but nothing else had been disturbed, as far as I could see, and nothing taken."</div>

After pulling on one of the pairs of gloves, she carefully lifts the package, weighs it in one hand, and unwraps it. A dove-grey box bearing the words Van Diest. Inside, on a pillow of grey velvet, an exquisite rose gold bracelet, set with twin diamonds at the clasp.</div>

On impulse, she lowers her face to the card, and detects expensive, feminine scent. Her hand shaking, she replaces the card in the box, possessed by emotions she can't immediately identify. Fear, certainly, but an almost stifling excitement, too. The woman who chose that beautiful, feminine object and wrote that message is a murderer. A stone-cold professional assassin whose every word is a lie, and whose every action is calculated to unsettle and manipulate. To meet her gaze, as Eve did just hours ago, is to look into a heart-freezing void. No fear, no pity, no human warmth, only their absence.</div>

Falling for the most blindingly obvious temptation, and personalising the situation in a completely irrational fashion.

<div class="line_en">"That's an understatement," says Eve. "But I've been watching her, too. She's been getting more and more reckless, especially in her dealings with me. That motorcycle cop caper, for example. Somewhere along the line she's going to go too far. And then we'll have her."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这都说轻了。”Eve回答。“不过我也一直在观察她，她已经越来越大胆了，尤其是对我。扮成骑警那事儿就是个例子。她总有一刻会越界玩过火的，那时我们就能抓住她。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Lance nods at the carrier bag holding the bracelet. "Maybe we don't really need to go out looking for her. Perhaps, if we just sit tight, she'll come to us."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="Lance朝装着手链的袋子点了点头。“可能我们也不需要特意去找她。说不定我们静观其变的话，她会主动找上门来。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Richard nods. "I don't like it, but I'm afraid you're right. That said, I think we need to acknowledge that we've turned a dangerous corner here. So full counter-surveillance measures, please. Remember your tradecraft. Eve and Billy, listen to Lance and be guided by him. If he tells you that a situation smells bad, you walk away."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="Richard点点头，“虽然不喜欢这想法，但恐怕你说得没错。就是说我们得清楚，现在开始我们便处境危险了。所以请用上你们全部的反侦查手段，记住所学的情报技术。Eve和Billy，你们听命Lance，由他指挥。如果他告诉你俩局势不妙，那你们就得抽身。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“很难。我只在上海匆匆瞥见过一个我觉得是她的人，今天她又在头盔下还戴了莱卡面具，所以我只能看见她的眼睛。但我能试试看。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Meanwhile, Eve, I'll have a word with the CO at Dever. Ask him to set up a detail to watch your flat. You probably won't see much of them, but they'll be there if you need them. Can we get a photofit of this V woman?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“与此同时，Eve，我和Dever市的行政长官谈过了，让他详细规划给你公寓监视保护的事。你可能不会常看到监视人员，但如果你有需要的话他们就会出现。我们能描述合成一张这个叫V的女人的照片吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Excellent. We're going to watch, and we're going to wait, and when she comes, we're going to be ready."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“很好。我们现在要静观其变，耐心等待，当她出现时，我们必须做好了万全准备。”">查看中文翻译</div>
