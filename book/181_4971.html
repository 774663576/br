<div class="line_en">"This is the land of Narnia," said the Faun, "where we are now; all that lies between the lamp-post and the great castle of Cair Paravel on the eastern sea. And you -- you have come from the wild woods of the west?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Ah!" said Mr Tumnus in a rather melancholy voice, "if only I had worked harder at geography when I was a little Faun, I should no doubt know all about those strange countries. It is too late now."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“唉！”图姆纳斯先生以一种有点忧郁的声音说道，“假如我小时候多学点地理，对这些奇怪的国家的情况就会一清二楚了，现在后悔莫及啊。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="露茜就这样，和这个奇怪的人手挽着手穿过了树林，好像他们老早就是好朋友似的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They had not gone far before they came to a place where the ground became rough and there were rocks all about and little hills up and little hills down. At the bottom of one small valley Mr Tumnus turned suddenly aside as if he were going to walk straight into an unusually large rock, but at the last moment Lucy found he was leading her into the entrance of a cave. As soon as they were inside she found herself blinking in the light of a wood fire. Then Mr Tumnus stooped and took a flaming piece of wood out of the fire with a neat little pair of tongs, and lit a lamp. "Now we shan't be long," he said, and immediately put a kettle on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没过多久，他们来到了一个地方，这里的路面高低不平，到处都是石头，起伏的小山连绵成片。在一个小山谷的谷底，图姆纳斯先生突然拐向一旁，向着一块大石头径直走去，最后，露茜发现他正领着她来到一个洞口。他们一走进洞内，露茜就感到两眼被木柴火照得睁不开来。图姆纳斯先生蹲下去，用一把小巧的火钳，从火堆里夹出一块正在燃烧的木柴头，点亮了一盏灯。“马上就好啦！”他一边说，一边把一个水壶放在火上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“好了，夏娃的女儿，就请吃吧。”羊怪说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Lucy thought she had never been in a nicer place. It was a little, dry, clean cave of reddish stone with a carpet on the floor and two little chairs ("one for me and one for a friend," said Mr Tumnus) and a table and a dresser and a mantelpiece over the fire and above that a picture of an old Faun with a grey beard. In one corner there was a door which Lucy thought must lead to Mr Tumnus's bedroom, and on one wall was a shelf full of books. Lucy looked at these while he was setting out the tea things. They had titles like The Life and Letters of Silenus or Nymphs and Their Ways or Men, Monks and Gamekeepers; a Study in Popular Legend or Is Man a Myth?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="露茜想，她从来没有到过比着更舒适的地方。窑洞不大，四壁的石头泛着红光，洞内很干净，地上铺着一条地毯，摆着两张小椅子（“一张我坐，另一张给朋友坐。”图姆纳斯先生说），还有一张桌子，一个碗橱，火炉上有个壁台，壁台的上方挂着一幅白胡子老羊怪的画像。窑洞的一角有一扇门，露茜想，这一定是通向图姆纳斯先生的卧室的。门边的壁橱上面放满了书，书名有：《森林之神的生活和学习》、《山林水泽中的仙女》、《人、僧侣和猎场看守人》、《民间传说的研究》、《人类神秘吗？》等等，羊怪摆出餐具的时候，露茜就翻看着这些书。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And really it was a wonderful tea. There was a nice brown egg, lightly boiled, for each of them, and then sardines on toast, and then buttered toast, and then toast with honey, and then a sugar-topped cake. And when Lucy was tired of eating the Faun began to talk. He had wonderful tales to tell of life in the forest. He told about the midnight dances and how the Nymphs who lived in the wells and the Dryads who lived in the trees came out to dance with the Fauns; about long hunting parties after the milk-white stag who could give you wishes if you caught him; about feasting and treasure-seeking with the wild Red Dwarfs in deep mines and caverns far beneath the forest floor; and then about summer when the woods were green and old Silenus on his fat donkey would come to visit them, and sometimes Bacchus himself, and then the streams would run with wine instead of water and the whole forest would give itself up to jollification for weeks on end. "Not that it isn't always winter now," he added gloomily. Then to cheer himself up he took out from its case on the dresser a strange little flute that looked as if it were made of straw and began to play. And the tune he played made Lucy want to cry and laugh and dance and go to sleep all at the same time. It must have been hours later when she shook herself and said:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说实在话。这是一顿很丰盛的茶点，先是每人一只深黄色的煮鸡蛋，煮得很嫩，接着是沙丁鱼盖烤面包，然后又是奶油面包，蜂蜜拌烤面包，白糖蛋糕，应有尽有。等露茜一点儿也不想再吃的时候，羊怪就和她攀谈起来。他有许多有关林中生活的精彩的故事。他向她描述了夜半舞会的盛况，讲水仙和树仙怎样出来和农牧之神一起跳舞，讲长长的打猎队伍怎样追逐乳白色的仙鹿，这种仙鹿如果你捕捉到了，它就会给你带来希望。他还讲了森林里的宴会，讲了怎样和机灵的红发矮神在离地面很深的矿井和岩洞里寻宝。最后，他讲了林中的夏天。那时，树木都披上了绿装，年迈的森林之神常常骑着肥壮的驴子来拜访他们。有时，酒神巴克斯也亲自光临。巴克斯一来，河里流着的水都变成了酒，整座森林一连好几个星期都沉浸在节日的欢宴中。“哪里像现在这样，冬天总是没完没了啊！”他话头一转，显得很是忧伤。为了振奋精神，他从碗橱上面的箱子里拿出一根小笛子吹了起来，这笛子看起来很奇怪，好像是用稻草秆做的。那曲调使露茜一会儿想哭，一会儿想笑，一会儿想跳舞，一会儿又想睡觉。露茜一直感到恍恍忽忽的，过了好几个钟头，她才醒转过来，对羊怪说：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No good?" said Lucy, jumping up and feeling rather frightened. "What do you mean? I've got to go home at once. The others will be wondering what has happened to me." But a moment later she asked, "Mr Tumnus! Whatever is the matter?" for the Faun's brown eyes had filled with tears and then the tears began trickling down its cheeks, and soon they were running off the end of its nose; and at last it covered its face with its hands and began to howl.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“怎么不行？”露茜被吓得猛地跳了起来，“你说什么？我要马上回去。别人还以为我出了什么事呢！”接着，她又问羊怪：“图姆纳斯先生，这究竟是怎么一回事？”这时，羊怪那棕色的眼睛里噙满了泪水，泪水沿着双颊一滴一滴地往下淌，又从鼻尖底下滚落了下来。最后，他用双手捂住了脸，号啕大哭起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, Mr Tumnus -- I'm so sorry to stop you, and I do love that tune -- but really, I must go home. I only meant to stay for a few minutes."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，图姆纳斯先生，打断了你的演奏，实在抱歉。我非常喜欢这种曲调，可是我得回去了，真的，我本来只想逗留几分钟的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Mr Tumnus! Mr Tumnus!" said Lucy in great distress. "Don't! Don't! What is the matter? Aren' you well? Dear Mr Tumnus, do tell me what is wrong." But the Faun continued sobbing as if its heart would break. And even when Lucy went over and put her arms round him and lent him her hand kerchief, he did not stop. He merely took the handker chief and kept on using it, wringing it out with both hands whenever it got too wet to be any more use, so that presently Lucy was standing in a damp patch.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“图姆纳斯先生，图姆纳斯先生，”露茜感到很难过，“别哭！别哭！到底是怎么回事？你哪儿不舒服吗？亲爱的图姆纳斯先生，你得告诉我呀！”但羊怪依旧哭个不停，好像他的心都要碎了似的。露茜走过去，双手搂住了他，把她的手绢儿掏出来递给他，他还是不停的抽泣。他接过手绢，一边哭，一边擦着眼泪，手绢湿的不能再用时就用双手拧几下，不一会儿，露茜脚下的一小块地方就湿漉漉的了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"And if I don't," said he, beginning to cry again "she's sure to find out. And she'll have my tail cut off and my horns sawn off, and my beard plucked out, and she'll wave her wand over my beautiful clove hoofs and turn them into horrid solid hoofs like wretched horse's. And if she is extra and specially angry she'll turn me into stone and I shall be only statue of a Faun in her horrible house until the four thrones at Cair Paravel are filled and goodness knows when that will happen, or whether it will ever happen at all."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“假如我不去告诉她，”说着，他又哭了起来，“她最后总会发现，她就要割去我的尾巴，锯断我的角，拔掉我的胡子。她还会挥动她的魔杖打掉我这美丽的偶蹄，把它们变成像劣马那样可怕的单蹄。如果她恼羞成怒，她就会把我变成石头，变成她那可怕的庭院里一座羊怪石像，直到凯尔·巴拉维尔的四个国王的宝座被人类占去以后为止。可是，谁知道这样的事情哪一天才能发生。到底是否会发生呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"We must go as quietly as we can," said Mr Tumnus. "The whole wood is full of her spies. Even some of the trees are on her side."</div>

<div class="line_en">They both got up and left the tea things on the table, and Mr Tumnus once more put up his umbrella and gave Lucy his arm, and they went out into the snow. The journey back was not at all like the journey to the Faun's cave; they stole along as quickly as they could, without speaking a word, and Mr Tumnus kept to the darkest places. Lucy was relieved when they reached the lamp-post again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们站起身来，连茶具也没有收拾，图姆纳斯先生又撑起了伞，让露茜夹着，两人出了门，走进了雪地里。他们一声不响地抄着小路，从树林中最隐蔽的地方急匆匆地跑着，一直跑到灯柱面前，露茜才松了一口气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Lucy looked very hard between the trees and could just see in the distance a patch of light that looked like daylight. "Yes," she said, "I can see the wardrobe door."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="露茜在树林里仔细的看了看，瞧见远方有一片亮光，看起来很像阳光。“认得。”她说，“我已看见了橱门。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Farewell, Daughter of Eve," said he. "Perhaps I may keep the handkerchief?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“再见了，夏娃的女儿。”他说，“这块手绢可以让我随身带走吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Rather!" said Lucy, and then ran towards the far off patch of daylight as quickly as her legs would carry her. And presently instead of rough branch brushing past her she felt coats, and instead of crunching snow under her feet she felt wooden board and all at once she found herself jumping out of the wardrobe into the same empty room from which the whole adventure had started. She shut the wardrobe door tightly behind her and looked around, panting for breath. It was still raining and she could hear the voices of the others in the passage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然可以。”露茜说完，就急急忙忙向着远处有亮光的地方飞奔过去。不一会，她就感到从她身上擦过的已不再是粗硬的树枝而是柔软的衣服了，她脚下也不是“嘎吱”“嘎吱”的雪，而是坚硬的木板了。一眨眼，她发现自己已离开了衣橱，来到了原来的那间空屋——这一段奇异的经历就是从这间空屋开始的。她紧紧地关上了橱门，向四周张望了一下，不停地喘着粗气。雨仍在下着，她清清楚楚地听见他们还在走廊里说话呢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm here," she shouted. "I'm here. I've come back I'm all right."</div>
