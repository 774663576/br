<div class="line_en">Lawson had been spending the summer at Poole, and had a number of sketches to show of the harbour and of the beach. He had a couple of commissions for portraits and proposed to stay in London till the bad light drove him away. Hayward, in London too, intended to spend the winter abroad, but remained week after week from sheer inability to make up his mind to go. Hayward had run to fat during the last two or three years -- it was five years since Philip first met him in Heidelberg -- and he was prematurely bald. He was very sensitive about it and wore his hair long to conceal the unsightly patch on the crown of his head. His only consolation was that his brow was now very noble. His blue eyes had lost their colour; they had a listless droop; and his mouth, losing the fulness of youth, was weak and pale. He still talked vaguely of the things he was going to do in the future, but with less conviction; and he was conscious that his friends no longer believed in him: when he had drank two or three glasses of whiskey he was inclined to be elegiac.</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip looked forward to his return to London with impatience. During the two months he spent at Blackstable Norah wrote to him frequently, long letters in a bold, large hand, in which with cheerful humour she described the little events of the daily round, the domestic troubles of her landlady, rich food for laughter, the comic vexations of her rehearsals -- she was walking on in an important spectacle at one of the London theatres -- and her odd adventures with the publishers of novelettes. Philip read a great deal, bathed, played tennis, and sailed. At the beginning of October he settled down in London to work for the Second Conjoint examination. He was eager to pass it, since that ended the drudgery of the curriculum; after it was done with the student became an out-patients' clerk, and was brought in contact with men and women as well as with text-books. Philip saw Norah every day.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普在布莱克斯塔布尔待了两个月，急不可待地盼着要回伦敦。诺拉经常给他写信，一写就是很长，字迹大而有力。她把每天发生的日常琐事描述得妙趣横生，有时和女房东闹了口角，有时排练演出的时候遇到些叫人哭笑不得的烦心事——她现在在伦敦某剧院的大戏里出演一个小角色——有时又要和小说的出版商斗智斗勇。菲利普这两个月过得很充实：博览群书、去海里游泳、打网球、出海航行。十月一到，他就回到伦敦，收心准备第二次联合考试，巴不得立刻通过，因为这意味着枯燥的课程就此告一段落了。学生们随后要去医院实习，当门诊大夫，不光和书本打交道，还能接触到不少人。菲利普每天都要和诺拉见面。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Partly for pleasure, because it's a habit and I'm just as uncomfortable if I don't read as if I don't smoke, and partly to know myself. When I read a book I seem to read it with my eyes only, but now and then I come across a passage, perhaps only a phrase, which has a meaning for me, and it becomes part of me; I've got out of the book all that's any use to me, and I can't get anything more if I read it a dozen times. You see, it seems to me, one's like a closed bud, and most of what one reads and does has no effect at all; but there are certain things that have a peculiar significance for one, and they open a petal; and the petals open one by one; and at last the flower is there."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“一部分是因为读书有乐趣。我已经习惯读书了，如果不看书就像不能抽烟一样浑身不自在。另一部分是想从书里认识自己。我看书的时候只用眼睛看，但有时候偶尔看到对我有特殊意义的一段话，甚至是几个字，那它就会和我融为一体，变成我的一部分。若是我已经从书里得到了所有对我有用的东西，那不管再读多少遍都不可能再学到更多了。我觉得人就像一朵花苞，读的书、做的事大都对你没有一点影响。可某些特定的东西会有非同寻常的意义，你会因为这些东西一瓣一瓣地绽放，直到完全盛开。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Philip knew Hayward very well by now. He was weak and vain, so vain that you had to be on the watch constantly not to hurt his feelings; he mingled idleness and idealism so that he could not separate them. At Lawson's studio one day he met a journalist, who was charmed by his conversation, and a week later the editor of a paper wrote to suggest that he should do some criticism for him. For forty-eight hours Hayward lived in an agony of indecision. He had talked of getting occupation of this sort so long that he had not the face to refuse outright, but the thought of doing anything filled him with panic. At last he declined the offer and breathed freely.</div>

<div class="line_en">But Hayward could still talk delightfully about books; his taste was exquisite and his discrimination elegant; and he had a constant interest in ideas, which made him an entertaining companion. They meant nothing to him really, since they never had any effect on him; but he treated them as he might have pieces of china in an auction-room, handling them with pleasure in their shape and their glaze, pricing them in his mind; and then, putting them back into their case, thought of them no more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说起读书，他还是跟以前一样兴致勃勃。对书籍的品位也是一如既往地高雅不凡。他一直对书中的观点颇感兴趣，聊天的时候也能够旁征博引，称得上是个非常有趣的伙伴。但这些观点对他起不了任何作用：就像在拍卖室看到几片瓷器碎片，总会拿起来把玩一番。看看它们的形状，欣赏一下釉面，在脑子里估个价，然后重新放回盒子里，再也不去琢磨了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then he went on to say beautiful things about Amiel, the professor of Geneva, whose brilliancy promised achievement which was never fulfilled; till at his death the reason of his failure and the excuse were at once manifest in the minute, wonderful journal which was found among his papers. Hayward smiled enigmatically.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他接着开始说起日内瓦的教授埃米尔的逸事。埃米尔才华横溢，大可成就一番事业，但做出的成绩却远不理想。直到他离世后，人们从他的文件里找到一本记录翔实、语言优美的日记，将他失败的理由娓娓道来。海沃德讲完故事后，露出了一个高深莫测的笑容。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And it was Hayward who made a momentous discovery. One evening, after due preparation, he took Philip and Lawson to a tavern situated in Beak Street, remarkable not only in itself and for its history -- it had memories of eighteenth-century glories which excited the romantic imagination -- but for its snuff, which was the best in London, and above all for its punch. Hayward led them into a large, long room, dingily magnificent, with huge pictures on the walls of nude women: they were vast allegories of the school of Haydon; but smoke, gas, and the London atmosphere had given them a richness which made them look like old masters. The dark panelling, the massive, tarnished gold of the cornice, the mahogany tables, gave the room an air of sumptuous comfort, and the leather-covered seats along the wall were soft and easy. There was a ram's head on a table opposite the door, and this contained the celebrated snuff. They ordered punch. They drank it. It was hot rum punch. The pen falters when it attempts to treat of the excellence thereof; the sober vocabulary, the sparse epithet of this narrative, are inadequate to the task; and pompous terms, jewelled, exotic phrases rise to the excited fancy. It warmed the blood and cleared the head; it filled the soul with well-being; it disposed the mind at once to utter wit and to appreciate the wit of others; it had the vagueness of music and the precision of mathematics. Only one of its qualities was comparable to anything else: it had the warmth of a good heart; but its taste, its smell, its feel, were not to be described in words. Charles Lamb, with his infinite tact, attempting to, might have drawn charming pictures of the life of his day; Lord Byron in a stanza of Don Juan, aiming at the impossible, might have achieved the sublime; Oscar Wilde, heaping jewels of Ispahan upon brocades of Byzantium, might have created a troubling beauty. Considering it, the mind reeled under visions of the feasts of Elagabalus; and the subtle harmonies of Debussy mingled with the musty, fragrant romance of chests in which have been kept old clothes, ruffs, hose, doublets, of a forgotten generation, and the wan odour of lilies of the valley and the savour of Cheddar cheese.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="海沃德有了个重大发现。某天晚上，收拾妥当后，他领着菲利普和劳森去了一家比克街的酒馆。这家鼎鼎有名的酒馆历史悠久——它能让人想起十八世纪的光辉岁月，一走进来就不禁浮想联翩——这里的鼻烟堪称是伦敦最好的货色，当然，最重要的当属店里的鸡尾酒。海沃德把他们领进一间宽敞、狭长的屋子，昏暗的光线不掩装修摆设的富丽堂皇。墙上挂着的大幅裸女画，是海顿流派的寓言画，可这屋里烟雾缭绕加上伦敦特有的晦暗阴沉，让这些画看起来似乎出自早期绘画大师的笔下。暗色的镶板、厚重黯淡的金色檐口，赤褐色的桌子给房间平添几分奢华之气。靠着墙的一排皮面椅子柔软又舒服。桌上正对大门的位置摆了颗公羊脑袋，里面装着久负盛名的鼻烟。他们点了鸡尾酒喝，热的朗姆酒里调了些果汁，入口之妙，绝非笔墨可以形容。任何文字都显得太过拘谨，寥寥辞藻又远远不足以表意，便是想起几个浮夸华丽的说法或几句带有异域情调的精妙言辞也只是在此情此景下应运而生罢了。酒一下肚，全身一暖，头脑清醒，连灵魂也熨帖许多。既能使人聊天时字字珠玑，又能助人领悟旁人的妙语连珠。品这味道，如闻乐声，朦胧缥缈。又似算数，至精至准。不论是味道、香气、口感都无法用语言描述，唯有一项可以斗胆一比：这酒的温度像副好心肠一般温暖。查尔斯·兰姆在世时要是多努把力，凭着他冲天的才气，也许能将那个时代的世间百态痛快淋漓地描绘一通。拜伦勋爵在创作长诗《唐璜》时，若是敢于为人所不能，想必也可以成就一部卓绝的著作。奥斯卡·王尔德如果能往拜占庭的锦缎上再镶嵌几颗伊斯法罕的珠宝也注定可以结晶出更动人心魄的美。此刻头晕目眩，眼前似乎模糊看到埃拉加巴卢斯大宴宾客的胜景；耳畔琴键起落，德彪西的乐曲清婉动人，丝丝情韵叩动心弦；一股旧衣箱的略带霉味的香气袅袅传来，仿佛闻到了不知多久以前的旧衣服、飞边领、长筒袜、紧身衣的气息；与此交融杂糅的还有深谷百合的幽香与硬质干酪的醇美。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Hayward discovered the tavern at which this priceless beverage was to be obtained by meeting in the street a man called Macalister who had been at Cambridge with him. He was a stockbroker and a philosopher. He was accustomed to go to the tavern once a week; and soon Philip, Lawson, and Hayward got into the habit of meeting there every Tuesday evening: change of manners made it now little frequented, which was an advantage to persons who took pleasure in conversation. Macalister was a big-boned fellow, much too short for his width, with a large, fleshy face and a soft voice. He was a student of Kant and judged everything from the standpoint of pure reason. He was fond of expounding his doctrines. Philip listened with excited interest. He had long come to the conclusion that nothing amused him more than metaphysics, but he was not so sure of their efficacy in the affairs of life. The neat little system which he had formed as the result of his meditations at Blackstable had not been of conspicuous use during his infatuation for Mildred. He could not be positive that reason was much help in the conduct of life. It seemed to him that life lived itself. He remembered very vividly the violence of the emotion which had possessed him and his inability, as if he were tied down to the ground with ropes, to react against it. He read many wise things in books, but he could only judge from his own experience (he did not know whether he was different from other people); he did not calculate the pros and cons of an action, the benefits which must befall him if he did it, the harm which might result from the omission; but his whole being was urged on irresistibly. He did not act with a part of himself but altogether. The power that possessed him seemed to have nothing to do with reason: all that reason did was to point out the methods of obtaining what his whole soul was striving for.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="海沃德偶然在街上遇到一个剑桥大学的同学，名叫麦卡利斯特，从他那听说了这家以鸡尾酒著名的酒馆。麦卡利斯特是个股票经纪人，也是个哲学家，一周固定去一次酒馆。很快，菲利普、劳森和海沃德就养成了每周二和他在那儿碰面的习惯。社会风俗一变，人们去酒馆喝酒的次数也随之骤减，但对那些喜欢边喝酒边聊天的人来说，这也不失为一件好事。麦卡利斯特骨架粗大，矮矮的个头和宽胖的身板很不相称；满脸横肉，说起话来却细声细语。他师承康德，看待事物都从理性角度出发，最喜欢絮叨自己的那套理论。菲利普津津有味地附耳听着。他早就发现没有什么比形而上学更能招他发笑了，但是究竟这套学说能不能行之有效地帮人分析日常事宜，他也不能非常确定。过去在布莱克斯塔布尔想破脑袋总结出的简洁而精妙的体系似乎并不管用。在他为米尔德里德搞得焦头烂额的时候，也没有帮上他多大的忙。他不太确定理智在生活当中是否真的重要。生活的规律无迹可寻。强烈的情感曾牢牢掌控着他，他只能听之任之，毫无反抗之力，就像被绳子紧紧捆在地上，完全动弹不得。书里倒是能读到些智言妙语，可真的到了实际生活里，他又总是只依据自身经验来判断事物（他不知道别人是不是也会这样），全不衡量利弊。有些事倘若做了对他是大大有利的，有些事置之不理则可能招致祸害，这些他都不去考虑，好像去向哪里都只靠某种无法抗拒的力量来驱使。不管所作所为是好是坏，都会全身心投入，这股控制着他的力量和理智一点关系都没有。理智的唯一作用就是为灵魂指明道路：要想实现内心的渴望，究竟该怎么做。">查看中文翻译</div>

Before I do anything I feel that I have choice, and that influences what I do; but afterwards, when the thing is done, I believe that it was inevitable from all eternity."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，别人的事，我没什么可说的。我说的只是自己的一些见解。意志自由这个想法太强烈了，无法摆脱，但我觉得这也仅仅是种想法罢了。它是我一切行为的最强烈的动机之一。之前，不管做什么都觉得自己可以选择，这也影响了我的一举一动。可之后，等事做成了，才发现自己根本是身不由己的。要做什么，从来都是老天说了算。”">查看中文翻译</div>
