<div class="line_en">On palm Sunday, one year after the Great War against the Santadio, Don Domenico Clericuzio celebrated the christening of two infants of his own blood and made the most important decision of his life. He invited the greatest Family chiefs in America, as well as Alfred Gronevelt, the owner of the Xanadu Hotel in Vegas, and David Redfellow, who had built up a vast drug empire in the United States. All his partners to some degree.</div>

<div class="line_en">Now the most powerful Mafia Family head in America, Don Clericuzio planned to relinquish that power, on the surface. It was time to play a different hand; obvious power was too dangerous. But the relinquishing of power was dangerous in itself. He had to do it with the most skillful benignity and with personal goodwill. And he had to do it on his own base.</div>

<div class="line_en">Before the arrival of the guests, the Don and his sons sat around the white wrought-iron table in the trellised garden at the back of the mansion. The oldest, Giorgio, was tall, with a small, fierce mustache and the lanky frame of an English gentleman, which he adorned with tailored clothes. He was twenty-seven, saturnine, with savage wit and closed face. The Don informed Giorgio that he, Giorgio, would be applying to the Wharton School of Business. There he would learn all the intricacies of stealing money while staying within the law.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="客人们还没到，唐和他的儿子围坐在后花园一张白色铁艺桌子前。大儿子乔治高高的个子，髭须修得精细硬朗，量身裁剪的衣服修饰出他那英国绅士一般修长的身形。他二十七岁，寡言少语，面色阴沉冷漠。唐告诉乔治，他准备让乔治去申请沃顿商学院。在那儿，他可以学到各种敛财而不触犯法律的把戏。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Giorgio did not question his father; this was a royal edict, not an invitation to discussion. He nodded obedience.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Don addressed his nephew, Joseph "Pippi" De Lena, next. The Don loved Pippi as much as he did his sons, for in addition to blood -- Pippi being his dead sister's son -- Pippi was the great general who had conquered the savage Santadio.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着，唐嘱咐他的侄子，约瑟夫·“皮皮”·德·莱纳。唐把皮皮当成亲生儿子一样喜欢。不光是因为血缘这么简单——皮皮是他亡姊的孩子，更主要的是，冲锋陷阵拿下桑塔迪奥家族的，正是皮皮。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He saw Pippi was not happy, that he must give reasons. "Your wife, Nalene, cannot live in the atmosphere of the Family, she cannot live in the Bronx Enclave. She is too different. She cannot be accepted by them. You must build your life away from us." Which was all true, but the Don had another reason. Pippi was the great hero general of the Clericuzio Family, and if he continued to be "Mayor" of the Bronx Enclave, he would be too powerful for the sons of the Don when the Don no longer lived.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他看得出来，皮皮不怎么开心。于是他给出了理由：“你老婆娜莱内没法在家族这种氛围里生活，也没法在布朗克斯①生活。她太与众不同了，大家不会接纳她。你只能到离我们远一点儿的地方过日子。”这些都是真的，不过此外，唐还有另一个原因：皮皮是克莱里库齐奥家族的英雄战将。如果他继续当布朗克斯地区的“市长”，一旦唐死了，他的儿子们怕是都得活在皮皮的阴影里了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You will be my Bruglione in the West," he told Pippi. "You will become rich. But there is important work to do."</div>

<div class="line_en">He handed Pippi the deed to a house in Las Vegas. The Don then turned to his youngest son, Vincent, a man of twenty-five. He was the shortest of the children, but built like a stone door. He was spare in speech, and he had a soft heart. He had learned all the classic peasant Italian dishes at his mother's knee, and it was he who had wept so bitterly at his mother's dying young.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他把拉斯维加斯一幢房子的房契递给了皮皮，然后转向了小儿子、二十五岁的文森特。几个孩子中，文森特的个子最矮，可结实得简直像石头城门。他的话不多，一副软心肠。还在母亲怀里撒娇的时候，他就学会了意大利的各种经典农家菜式；他母亲去世得早，他当时哭得最伤心。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Don smiled at him. "I am about to decide your destiny," he said, "and set you on your true path. You will open the finest restaurant in New York. Spare no expense. I want you to show the French what real food is all about." Pippi and the other sons laughed, even Vincent smiled. The Don smiled at him. "You will go to the best cooking school in Europe for a year."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="唐朝他笑了：“我要决定你的命运了，”他说，“我要让你去做真正想做的事，你去纽约开一家最好的餐馆。别不舍得花钱，要让法国人见识一下什么才是真正的美食。”皮皮和其他的子侄都笑了，连文森特自己都乐了。唐笑着对他说：“你去欧洲最好的烹饪学校学上一年。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Don gave him a stern look. "Your pastries could be better," he said. "But the main purpose is to learn the finances of running such an enterprise. Who knows, someday you may own a chain of restaurants. Giorgio will give you the money."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="唐严肃地看着他：“你的点心技术还可以再提高些，”他说，“不过，最主要的目的是学习怎么经营和管理财务。说不定你能开自己的连锁餐馆。乔治给你投钱。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="最后，唐看着佩蒂耶。佩蒂耶是二儿子，三个儿子里他最活跃。他性情温和，虽然不过是二十六岁的毛头小伙子，唐却知道，他的身上，有着西西里克莱里库齐奥家族昔日的风采。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Petie," the Don said, "Now that Pippi is in the West, you will be Mayor of the Bronx Enclave. You will supply all the soldiers for the Family. But also, I have bought you a construction company business, a large one. You will repair the skyscrapers of New York, you will build state police barracks, you will pave the city streets. That business is assured but I expect you to make it a great company. Your soldiers can have legitimate employment and you will make a great deal of money. First you will serve an apprenticeship under the man who now owns it. But remember, your primary duty is to supply and command soldiers of the Family." He turned to Giorgio.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“佩蒂耶，”唐说道，“皮皮去西部的话，你就是布朗克斯的头领了。你要为家族提供能够拼命的人。我给你揽了一桩大买卖，是一个建筑公司。以后就由你来翻修纽约的摩天大楼，兴建州警署的营房，铺设城市道路。这桩生意很稳当，但是我希望你能把它做大。这样一来，你手下的人都有了合法工作，你也能大赚一笔。你先去给这公司现在的老板当学徒。不过记住，你的主业，是要给家族供应和调配人手。”他转向了乔治。">查看中文翻译</div>

You and Vinnie will no longer take part in that necessary part of the Family which invites danger, except when it is absolutely necessary. We must look ahead. Your children, my children, and little Dante and Croccifixio must never grow up in this world. We are rich, we no longer have to risk our lives to earn our daily bread. Our Family will now serve only as financial advisors to all the other Families. We will serve as their political support, mediate their quarrels. But to do this we must have cards to play. We must have an army. And we must protect everyone's money, for which they will let us wet our beaks."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“乔治，”唐说，“你来继承我的位置。除非绝对有对必要，否则那些有危险的事情，你和文尼①就不要再参与了。眼光要往前看。你的孩子、我的孩子、小丹特，还有克罗奇菲西奥，他们不能在这种环境里成长。我们有钱，犯不着为了吃饱饭豁出命去。从今以后，我们家族的角色，就只是其他家族的财政顾问。我们帮他们出谋划策、调停他们的纠纷。但是要做这份差事，我们手头要有底牌和得力的人手。而且，我们必须保护每个家族的财产，这样他们才能让我们分享利益。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="巨大的草坪上摆满了餐桌，翅膀一样的绿色遮阳伞包围了桌子，两百位客人都聚集在这里，他们中许多人都来自布朗克斯地区。洗礼庆典本来应该是一片欢腾，但是眼下却稍显压抑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Directly in the center of the circle of picnic tables, the Don saw the two baby carriages with their blue blankets. How brave the two babies were, they had not flinched when struck with Holy Water. Beside them were the two mothers, Rose Marie and Nalene De Lena, Pippi's wife. He could see the babies' faces, so unmarked by life, Dante Clericuzio and Croccifixio De Lena. He was responsible for ensuring that these two children would never have to suffer to earn a living. If he succeeded, they would enter the regular society of the world. It was curious, he thought, that there was no man in the crowd paying homage to the infants.</div>

It resembled the New York street hot dog carts, except that it was bigger, it had a brighter umbrella, and Vincent gave out better food. He wore a clean white apron, and he made his hot dogs with sauerkraut and mustard, with red onions and hot sauce. Each small child had to give him a kiss on the cheek for a hot dog.

<div class="line_en">On the boccie court, he saw Petie, playing with Pippi De Lena, Virginio Ballazzo, and Alfred Gronevelt.

<div class="line_en">Virginio Ballazzo was the Don's underboss, an executive officer in the Clericuzio Family. He was a high-spirited man and was pretending to chase Petie, who was pretending to run.

<div class="line_en">His dear friend Virginio Ballazzo had appeared on the boccie court, the only man who could rival Pippi's skill. Ballazzo gave a great flourish as he let his ball go, and there was a loud cheer as he made the successful hit. He raised his hand to the balcony in triumph, and the Don clapped. He felt a sense of pride that such men flowered and prospered under his rule, as had all the people who had gathered together on this Palm Sunday in Quogue. And that his foresight would protect them in the difficult years to come.</div>
