<div class="line_en">They stayed for tea of course, and instead of a lazy nibbling of cucumber sandwiches under the chestnut tree, we had the paraphernalia of a stiff tea in the drawing-room, which I always loathed. Frith in his element of course, directing Robert with a lift of his eyebrows, and myself rather hot and flustered with a monstrous silver teapot and kettle that I never knew how to manage. I found it very difficult to gauge the exact moment when it became imperative to dilute the tea with the boiling water, and more difficult still to concentrate on the small talk that was going on at my side.</div>

<div class="line_en">We had to come forward and welcome the unexpected guests. As often happens in such cases, these were not to be the only visitors. Another car arrived about half an hour afterwards, followed by three local people who had walked from Kerrith, and we found ourselves, with the peace stripped from our day, entertaining group after group of dreary acquaintances, doing the regulation walk in the grounds, the tour of the rose-garden, the stroll across the lawns, and the formal inspection of the Happy Valley.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们只得硬着头皮上前迎接那几位不速之客。事情往往这样，客人要么不来，一来就是三五成群，络绎不绝。大约过了半个小时，又驶来一辆车，接着又有三位乡邻从克里斯徒步来访。这天的清闲就此完了。一个下午，我们忙着接待一批又一批叫人头痛的泛泛之交，照例又得陪他们在屋前屋后兜上一圈，到玫瑰园走走，在草坪上散步，还要礼数周到地领他们到幸福谷去观光。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was one Sunday, I remember, when we had an invasion of visitors during the afternoon, that the subject of the fancy dress ball was first brought up. Frank Crawley had come over to lunch, and we were all three of us looking forward to a peaceful afternoon under the chestnut tree when we heard the fatal sound of a car rounding the sweep in the drive. It was too late to warn Frith, the car itself came upon us standing on the terrace with cushions and papers under our arms.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="关于举行化装舞会的主意，我记得最初是在某个星期天提出来的。那天下午，一大群客人纷至沓来。这天，弗兰克—克劳利在我们这儿吃了中饭，我们三人正指望在栗子树下享一个下午的清福，不料，车道拐角处却响起汽车马达声。这一下已来不及给弗里思打招呼。汽车一转眼开到我们跟前。当时，我们腋下夹着坐垫和报纸，猝不及防地站在平台上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Frank Crawley was invaluable at a moment like this. He took the cups from me and handed them to people, and when my answers seemed more than usually vague owing to my concentration on the silver teapot he quietly and unobtrusively put in his small wedge to the conversation, relieving me of responsibility. Maxim was always at the other end of the room, showing a book to a bore, or pointing out a picture, playing the perfect host in his own inimitable way, and the business of tea was a side-issue that did not matter to him. His own cup of tea grew cold, left on a side table behind some flowers, and I, steaming behind my kettle, and Frank gallantly juggling with scones and angel cake, were left to minister to the common wants of the herd. It was Lady Crowan, a tiresome gushing woman who lived in Kerrith, who introduced the matter. There was one of those pauses in conversation that happen in every teaparty, and I saw Frank's lips about to form the inevitable and idiotic remark about an angel passing overhead, when Lady Crowan, balancing a piece of cake on the edge of her saucer, looked up at Maxim who happened to be beside her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这种场合，弗兰克—克劳利实在是个不可多得的好帮手。他从我手中接过一盏盏茶盅，递到客人手里。由于尽顾着手里的银茶壶，我的对答言词似乎比平时更加含糊，不知所云。每逢这时，他就会在一旁很得体地悄悄插进一言半语，接过话头，巧妙地给我解了围。迈克西姆一直呆在客厅的另一头，应付着某个讨厌的家伙，给他看本书或是看幅画什么的。他施展出那套炉火纯青的应酬功夫，充当着完美无缺的男主人的角色。至于像沏茶这种玩意儿，在他看来不过是无关紧要的细枝末节。他自己的那杯茶已被忘在鲜花后面的一张茶几上冷了。而我和弗兰克就得在这一边照料一大帮子客人，满足他们的口腹之欲。我提着水壶冲茶，头上直冒热气；周到殷勤的弗兰克则像玩杂耍似地分送着薄煎饼和蛋糕。举行化装舞会的主意是克罗温夫人提出来的。这位夫人住在克里斯，是个讨厌的长舌妇。当时，客厅里出现了冷场——这在任何茶会上也都难免——我看见弗兰克刚想张嘴，吐出那句照例必讲的什么“天使打头顶飞过”①之类的傻话。就在这时，克罗温夫人一面将手里的蛋糕小心地搁在碟子边上，一面抬起头来望着恰巧站在她身边的迈克西姆。【注：①西洋迷信说法，认为众人之所以凑巧同时住嘴，乃鬼神使然。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh, Mr Crawley, do be on my side," she persisted, and one or two of the others joined in. "It would be a most popular move, you know, we all miss the Manderley gaiety."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，克劳利先生，你一定得站在我这一边，”她真有一股锲而不舍的劲儿。另外也有一两个人在旁边帮腔。“这可是最得人心的一招哪，您知道，我们都很留恋曼陀丽的狂欢场面。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, but I assure you we have all thought of it so much," continued Lady Crowan. "It used to make the summer for all of us in this part of the world. You have no idea of the pleasure it used to give. Can't I persuade you to think about it again?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“喔，可是我敢说，我们大家都经常在念叨呢，”克罗温夫人接着说。“以往，这种舞会对我们这一带的人说来可是盛夏佳节。您不知道当年它给了我们多少生活乐趣。难道我还不能说服您重新考虑一下吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was a moment or two before Maxim replied, and when he did his voice was quite calm and matter-of-fact. "I haven't thought about it," he said, "and I don't think anyone else has."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克西姆沉吟了半晌才开口，说话时全然不动声色，语气干巴巴的。“我没有想过，”他说。“我看别人也没有想到过吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, Mr de Winter," she said, "there is something I've been wanting to ask you for ages. Now tell me, is there any chance of you reviving the Manderley fancy dress ball?" She put her head on one side as she spoke, flashing her too prominent teeth in what she supposed was a smile. I lowered my head instantly, and became very busy with the emptying of my own teacup, screening myself behind the cosy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，德温特先生，”她说，“有件事我早就想问问您啦。请告诉我，您是不是有意恢复曼陀丽的化装舞会？”说着，她把头一歪，咧开嘴，露出她那排暴突的牙齿，这在她大概就算是嫣然一笑了。我赶紧低下头，借茶壶的保暖罩作掩护，一个劲儿喝着自己面前的那杯茶。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes, of course," said somebody else, a man. "We missed the fun of the wedding, you know; it's a shame to deprive us of all excitement. Hands up for the Manderley fancy dress ball. There you see, de Winter? Carried unanimously." There was much laughter and clapping of hands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可不是嘛，”有位男客附和说。“要知道，我们已经错过了婚礼，没能热闹一场，你们怎么好意思把我们的乐趣全给剥夺了呢。赞成在曼陀丽开化装舞会的人举手了。你瞧见了，德温特？一致赞成！”在场的人又是笑又是鼓掌。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Of course I was bombarded at once. Lady Crowan moved her chair so that the cosy no longer hid me from view. "Now, Mrs de Winter, you get round your husband. You are the person he will listen to. He should give the ball in your honour as the bride."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我当然立即成了进攻的目标。克罗温夫人把座椅一挪，这样，那只保暖罩就再也不能给我打掩护。“听我说，德温特夫人，您得说服您丈夫。只有您的话他才肯听。他应该开个舞会，对您这位新娘聊表庆贺。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“她当然巴望能为她开个庆祝舞会，”克罗温夫人又饶舌了。“哪个姑娘不巴望这么热闹一场？我说，德温特夫人，您要是扮个德累斯顿牧羊女，把头发塞在大三角帽底下，那模样儿一定迷人。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我想，就凭我这双笨拙的手脚，这副瘦骨伶仃的肩胛，还能扮得了典雅的德累斯顿牧羊女！这女人真是个白痴。难怪没人附和她。这一回我又得感激弗兰克，是他把话题从我身上引开的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"As a matter of fact, Maxim, someone was talking about it the other day. "I suppose we shall be having some sort of celebration for the bride, shan't we, Mr Crawley?" he said. "I wish Mr de Winter would give a ball again. It was rare fun for all of us." It was Tucker at the home farm," he added, to Lady Crowan. "Of course they do adore a show of any kind. I don't know, I told him. Mr de Winter hasn't said anything to me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“其实，迈克西姆，”他说，“前几天就有人同我谈起过这事。‘克劳利先生，我想我们总该举行个什么仪式，为新娘祝贺一下吧？’此人这么说。‘我希望德温特先生会再举办一次舞会。过去，我们大家玩得可带劲呢。’说这话的是塔克，咱们自己农庄上的，”他面朝克罗温夫人补充了这么一句。“当然罗，不论什么样的娱乐他们都很喜欢。‘我可说不上来，’我告诉他。‘德温特先生没在我面前说起过。’”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There you are," said Lady Crowan triumphantly to the drawing-room in general. "What did I say? Your own people are asking for a ball. If you don't care for us, surely you care about them."</div>

It occurred to me that perhaps he thought I could not face it, that being shy, as he knew only too well, I should find myself unable to cope. I did not want him to think that.

<div class="line_en">We wandered out on to the terrace, everyone discussing the prospect of the ball and suitable dates, and then, greatly to my relief, the car parties decided it was time to take their departure, and the walkers went too, on being offered a lift. I went back into the drawing-room and had another cup of tea which I thoroughly enjoyed now that the burden of entertaining had been taken from me, and Frank came too, and we crumbled up the remains of the scones and ate them, feeling like conspirators.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们信步走出屋子，来到平台，大家七嘴八舌地议论开了：舞会应该开成什么样子，放在哪一天最合适；最后，总算让我大大松了口气，乘汽车来的那帮子人觉得该告辞了，而步行来的人，因为可以搭便车，也一起走了。我回到客厅，又倒了一杯茶，这会儿卸去了应酬的重负，我才好好品尝起茶味来；弗兰克也走了进来，我们把剩下的薄煎饼弄碎了统统吞下肚子，觉得像是在合伙做什么偷偷摸摸的事。">查看中文翻译</div>

As Frank had said, I did not have to bother my head about anything. I don't think I licked one stamp. I began to get in a panic about my costume. It seemed so feeble not to be able to think of anything, and I kept remembering all the people who would come, from Kerrith and round about, the bishop's wife who had enjoyed herself so much the last time, Beatrice and Giles, that tiresome Lady Crowan, and many more people I did not know and who had never seen me, they would every one of them have some criticism to offer, some curiosity to know what sort of effort I should make. At last, in desperation, I remembered the books that Beatrice had given me for a wedding present, and I sat down in the library one morning turning over the pages as a last hope, passing from illustration to illustration in a sort of frenzy. Nothing seemed suitable, they were all so elaborate and pretentious, those gorgeous costumes of velvet and silk in the reproductions given of Rubens, Rembrandt and others. I got hold of a piece of paper and a pencil and copied one or two of them, but they did not please me, and I threw the sketches into the waste-paper basket in disgust, thinking no more about them.</div>

Rebecca, with her beauty, her charm, her breeding, why did she have a cousin like Jack Favell? It was wrong, out of all proportion. I decided he must be the skeleton in the family cupboard, and Rebecca with her generosity had taken pity on him from time to time and invited him to Manderley, perhaps when Maxim was from home, knowing his dislike.

<div class="line_en">"Do you know you were going through the most extraordinary antics instead of eating your fish?" said Maxim. "First you listened, as though you heard the telephone, and then your lips moved, and you threw half a glance at me. And you shook your head, and smiled, and shrugged your shoulders. All in about a second. Are you practising your appearance for the fancy dress ball?" He looked across at me, laughing, and I wondered what he would say if he really knew my thoughts, my heart, and my mind, and that for one second he had been the Maxim of another year, and I had been Rebecca. "You look like a little criminal," he said, "what is it?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你可知道，你没在吃鱼，而是在挤眉噘嘴，做着一连串莫名其妙的滑稽动作？”迈克西姆说。“起先，你竖起耳朵，似乎听到了电话铃声，接着你嘴里念念有词，偷偷瞟我一眼。后来，你又摇头，又抿嘴微笑，又耸肩膀，大概只用一秒钟就做了这一系列的动作。你在练习怎么在化装舞会上漏脸亮相吧？”他从桌子那头望着我，呵呵大笑。我暗自思忖，要是他真的看透了我的思想、我的心情、我的悬念，知道刚才那一瞬间我把他当作往年的迈克西姆，而我自己俨然成了吕蓓卡，他会怎么说？“你看上去活像个调皮的小捣蛋，”他说。“告诉我是怎么回事？”">查看中文翻译</div>

He got up and strolled about the room, and asked Frith to bring the coffee in the library.

<div class="line_en">When I had finished I went upstairs to the minstrels' gallery to have a look at the pictures. I knew them well of course by now, but had never studied them with a view to reproducing one of them as a fancy dress. Mrs Danvers was right of course. What an idiot I had been not to think of it before. I always loved the girl in white, with a hat in her hand. It was a Raeburn, and the portrait was of Caroline de Winter, a sister of Maxim's great-great grandfather. She married a great Whig politician, and was a famous London beauty for many years, but this portrait was painted before that, when she was still unmarried. The white dress should be easy to copy. Those puffed sleeves, the flounce, and the little bodice. The hat might be rather difficult, and I should have to wear a wig. My straight hair would never curl in that way. Perhaps that Voce place in London that Mrs Danvers had told me about would do the whole thing. I would send them a sketch of the portrait and tell them to copy it faithfully, sending my measurements.</div>

<div class="line_en">Clarice could hardly contain herself for excitement, and I, too, began to get party fever as the great day approached. Giles and Beatrice were coming for the night, but nobody else, thank heaven, although a lot of people were expected to dinner first. I had imagined we should have to hold a large house-party for the occasion, but Maxim decided against it. "Having the dance alone is quite enough effort," he said; and I wondered whether he did it for my sake alone, or whether a large crowd of people really bored him as he said. I had heard so much of the Manderley parties in the old days, with people sleeping in bathrooms and on sofas because of the squash. And here we were alone in the vast house, with only Beatrice and Giles to count as guests.</div>

Robert rather lost his head, and kept forgetting things, napkins at lunch, and handing vegetables. He wore a harassed expression, like someone who has got to catch a train. The dogs were miserable. Jasper trailed about the hall with his tail between his legs, and nipped every workman on sight. He used to stand on the terrace, barking idiotically, and then dash madly to one corner of the lawn and eat grass in a sort of frenzy. Mrs Danvers never obtruded herself, but I was aware of her continually. It was her voice I heard in the drawing-room when they came to put the tables, it was she who gave directions for the laying of the floor in the hall. Whenever I came upon the scene she had always just disappeared; I would catch a glimpse of her skirt brushing the door, or hear the sound of her footsteps on the stairs. I was a lay-figure, no use to man or beast. I used to stand about doing nothing except get in the way. "Excuse me, Madam," I would hear a man say, just behind me, and he would pass, with a smile of apology, carrying two chairs on his back, his face dripping with perspiration.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mrs Danvers showed herself at last; quietly, calmly, she told the gardeners where to put the flowers, and she herself arranged them, stacking the vases with quick, deft fingers. I watched her in fascination, the way she did vase after vase, carrying them herself through the flower-room to the drawing-room and the various corners of the house, massing them in just the right numbers and profusion, putting colour where colour was needed, leaving the walls bare where severity paid.</div>

She'll soon tell you if she doesn't like your dress. Dear old Bee always looks just wrong on these occasions, bless her. I remember her once as Madame Pompadour and she tripped up going in to supper and her wig came adrift. 'I can't stand this damned thing,' she said, in that blunt voice of hers, and chucked it on a chair and went through the rest of the evening with her own cropped hair. You can imagine what it looked like, against a pale blue satin crinoline, or whatever the dress was. Poor Giles did not cope that year. He came as a cook, and sat about in the bar all night looking perfectly miserable. I think he felt Bee had let him down."</div>

<div class="line_en">The old austerity had gone. Manderley had come alive in a fashion I would not have believed possible. It was not the still quiet Manderley I knew. There was a certain significance about it now that had not been before. A reckless air, rather triumphant, rather pleasing. It was as if the house remembered other days, long, long ago, when the hall was a banqueting hall indeed, with weapons and tapestry hanging upon the walls, and men sat at a long narrow table in the centre laughing louder than we laughed now, calling for wine, for song, throwing great pieces of meat upon the flags to the slumbering dogs. Later, in other years, it would still be gay, but with a certain grace and dignity, and Caroline de Winter, whom I should represent tonight, would walk down the wide stone stairs in her white dress to dance the minuet. I wished we could sweep away the years and see her. I wished we did not have to degrade the house with our modern jig-tunes, so out-of-place and unromantic. They would not suit Manderley. I found myself in sudden agreement with Mrs Danvers. We should have made it a period ball, not the hotchpotch of humanity it was bound to be, with Giles, poor fellow, well-meaning and hearty in his guise of Arabian sheik. I found Clarice waiting for me in my bedroom, her round face scarlet with excitement. We giggled at one another like schoolgirls, and I bade her lock my door. There was much sound of tissue paper, rustling and mysterious. We spoke to one another softly like conspirators, we walked on tiptoe. I felt like a child again on the eve of Christmas. This padding to and fro in my room with bare feet, the little furtive bursts of laughter, the stifled exclamations, reminded me of hanging up my stocking long ago. Maxim was safe in his dressing-room, and the way through was barred against him. Clarice alone was my ally and favoured friend. The dress fitted perfectly. I stood still, hardly able to restrain my impatience while Clarice hooked me up with fumbling fingers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="原先严峻、沉寂的气氛已荡然无存。曼陀丽以一种不可思议的神秘方式苏醒过来，不再是我熟悉的那座静综萧瑟的古宅。此刻它显示出某种前所未有的深刻涵义，一种无拘无束、洋洋自得、赏心悦目的气氛，整幢屋子令人回忆起消逝已久的往昔年华，那时候这座大厅就是宴会厅，墙上挂满兵器和缀锦花毯，武士们坐在大厅中央的狭长餐桌旁，发出比我们今日更为豪爽的欢笑，大声呼唤上酒，要人献歌助兴，随手抓起堆在菖蒲上的大块大块兽肉，朝呼呼熟睡的猎犬扔去。后来，不知过了多少年，大厅里固有的欢乐气氛之中又掺杂了几分典雅和庄重，而卡罗琳—德温特——就是我今晚要装扮的那位少女——穿着那身洁白的衣裙，顺着宽阔的石梯款步拾级而下，翩然跳起小步舞。但愿我们能拨开岁月的层层云翳，一睹她的真容。但愿我们别用现代风行的快步舞曲，贬辱了古宅的尊严，这种曲调既不合时，又无浪漫气息，同曼陀而格格不入。我不知不觉中突然和丹弗斯太太见解一致了：我们确实应该开一个体现某一时代风貌的古装舞会，而不该搞成现在这种不伦不类的人种大杂烩似的格局，而那位贾尔斯老兄，用心良苦，情真意诚的贾尔斯，竟扮起阿拉伯酋长来了。我发现克拉丽斯在卧室里等着我，她那张小圆脸激动得透出红光。我们像一对女学生，相互轻轻地对笑。我吩咐她把门锁上。接着，屋里顿时响起一阵带神秘意味的薄绵纸的瑟瑟声。我们像密谋起事的阴谋家，说起话来压着嗓子，走起路来赔着脚尖。我觉得自己又像个圣诞节前夜的小姑娘了，光着脚板在自己房里走来走去，偷偷摸摸地连声傻笑，压低着嗓门喷嘴惊叹。这一切都勾起我对童年的回忆，想到当年临睡前挂起袜子①的情景。不用担心迈克西姆，他在自己的更衣室里，通那儿的门已被关上。房里只有克拉丽斯，她是我的心腹，我的帮手。那套衣服穿着合身。我站着一动不动，克拉丽斯笨手笨脚地替我扣上褡扣，我简直有点不耐烦了。【注：①西洋风俗，圣诞节前夜挂上袜子，第二天就能在里面找到圣诞老人赠送的礼物。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As we crossed the great hall on the way to our rooms I realized for the first time how the house lent itself to the occasion, and how beautiful the rooms were looking. Even the drawing-room, formal and cold to my consideration when we were alone, was a blaze of colour now, flowers in every corner, red roses in silver bowls on the white cloth of the supper table, the long windows open to the terrace, where, as soon as it was dusk, the fairy lights would shine. The band had stacked their instruments ready in the minstrels' gallery above the hall, and the hall itself wore a strange, waiting air; there was a warmth about it I had never known before, due to the night itself, so still and clear, to the flowers beneath the pictures, to our own laughter as we hovered on the wide stone stairs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在一路穿过大厅，往我们各自的房间走去的时候，我才第一次认识到这座巨宅真不愧是举行盛典的理想场所，那些房间看上去多么气派。甚至连那座客厅，往常就我们这几个人时，我总觉得它刻板而又肃穆，现在却是五彩缤纷，绚丽夺目，四周角落里摆满了鲜花。鲜红的玫瑰花插在银盆里，端放在铺着洁白台布的餐桌上。落地长窗洞开着，通向平台，待到暮色苍茫之际，那儿的彩灯就会竟放异彩。在大厅上方的吟游诗人画廊里，乐队已经支起乐谱架子，乐器也已—一摆开。大厅里呈现出一片静等嘉宾光临的不平常的气氛，给我一种以前从未感觉到的温暖。这种暖意来自夜晚本身的宁静和清朗，来自画像下面的那些鲜花，以及我们漫步登上宽阔的石筑楼梯时发出的阵阵爽朗笑声。">查看中文翻译</div>

They are supposed to stand out from the face." Clarice stood behind my shoulder, I saw her round face beyond mine in the reflection of the looking-glass, her eyes shining, her mouth a little open. I brushed my own hair sleek behind my ears. I took hold of the soft gleaming curls with trembling fingers, laughing under my breath, looking up at Clarice.</div>
