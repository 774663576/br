<div class="line_en">Once Elsa asked why so many not-shits had to die everywhere, and why so many shits didn't. And why anyone at all had to die, whether a shit or not. Granny tried to distract Elsa with ice cream and change the subject, because Granny preferred ice cream to death. But Elsa was capable of being a bewilderingly obstinate kid, so Granny gave up in the end and admitted that she supposed something always had to give up its own space so that something else could take its place.</div>

<div class="line_en">Granny and Elsa used to watch the evening news together. Now and then Elsa would ask Granny why grown-ups were always doing such idiotic things to each other. Granny usually answered that it was because grown-ups are generally people, and people are generally shits. Elsa countered that grown-ups were also responsible for a lot of good things in between all the idiocy -- space exploration, the UN, vaccines, and cheese slicers, for instance. Granny then said the real trick of life was that almost no one is entirely a shit and almost no one is entirely not a shit. The hard part of life is keeping as much on the not-a-shit side as one can.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="外婆和爱莎以前常一起看傍晚新闻。爱莎有时会问外婆，为什么成年人总是对彼此做蠢事。外婆回答，因为一般来说成年人是人，而一般来说人都是蠢货。爱莎细数着成年人在愚蠢之外创造的美好事物，比如太空探索、联合国、疫苗和芝士切片器。外婆接着说，生命真正的陷阱在于几乎没有人是彻头彻尾的混蛋，也几乎没有人从未做过混蛋事。生命的难处就在于尽可能多地待在“不是混蛋”这一侧。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Elsa thinks about that while sitting in the waiting room at the veterinary clinic. It smells of birdseed. Britt-Marie sits next to her with her hands clasped together in her lap, watching a cockatoo sitting in its cage on the other side of the room. Britt-Marie doesn't seem so very keen on cockatoos. Elsa isn't wholly conversant with the exact emotional utterances of cockatoos, but she reckons the feeling is mutual.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the oldest fairy tales from Miamas they say a wurse can die only of a broken heart. Otherwise, they're immortal. This is why it became possible to kill them after they were sent into exile from the Land-of-Almost-Awake for biting the princess: because they were sent away by the very people they had protected and loved. "And that was why they could be killed in the last battle of the War-Without-End," Granny explained -- for hundreds of wurses died in that last battle --"because the hearts of all living creatures are broken in war."</div>
