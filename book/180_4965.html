<div class="line_en">[The sea without a stain on it, thought Lily Briscoe, still standing and looking out over the bay. The sea stretched like silk across the bay. Distance had an extraordinary power; they had been swallowed up in it, she felt, they were gone for ever, they had become part of the nature of things. It was so calm; it was so quiet. The steamer itself had vanished, but the great scroll of smoke still hung in the air and drooped like a flag mournfully in valediction.]</div>

<div class="line_en">It was like that then, the island, thought Cam, once more drawing her fingers through the waves. She had never seen it from out at sea before. It lay like that on the sea, did it, with a dent in the middle and two sharp crags, and the sea swept in there, and spread away for miles and miles on either side of the island. It was very small; shaped something like a leaf stood on end. So we took a little boat, she thought, beginning to tell herself a story of adventure about escaping from a sinking ship. But with the sea streaming through her fingers, a spray of seaweed vanishing behind them, she did not want to tell herself seriously a story; it was the sense of adventure and escape that she wanted, for she was thinking, as the boat sailed on, how her father's anger about the points of the compass, James's obstinacy about the compact, and her own anguish, all had slipped, all had passed, all had streamed away. What then came next? Where were they going? From her hand, ice cold, held deep in the sea, there spurted up a fountain of joy at the change, at the escape, at the adventure (that she should be alive, that she should be there). And the drops falling from this sudden and unthinking fountain of joy fell here and there on the dark, the slumbrous shapes in her mind; shapes of a world not realised but turning in their darkness, catching here and there, a spark of light; Greece, Rome, Constantinople. Small as it was, and shaped something like a leaf stood on its end with the gold- sprinkled waters flowing in and about it, it had, she supposed, a place in the universe -- even that little island? The old gentlemen in the study she thought could have told her. Sometimes she strayed in from the garden purposely to catch them at it. There they were (it might be Mr Carmichael or Mr Bankes who was sitting with her father) sitting opposite each other in their low arm-chairs. They were crackling in front of them the pages of THE TIMES, when she came in from the garden, all in a muddle, about something some one had said about Christ, or hearing that a mammoth had been dug up in a London street, or wondering what Napoleon was like. Then they took all this with their clean hands (they wore grey-coloured clothes; they smelt of heather) and they brushed the scraps together, turning the paper, crossing their knees, and said something now and then very brief. Just to please herself she would take a book from the shelf and stand there, watching her father write, so equally, so neatly from one side of the page to another, with a little cough now and then, or something said briefly to the other old gentleman opposite. And she thought, standing there with her book open, one could let whatever one thought expand here like a leaf in water; and if it did well here, among the old gentlemen smoking and THE TIMES crackling then it was right. And watching her father as he wrote in his study, she thought (now sitting in the boat) he was not vain, nor a tyrant and did not wish to make you pity him. Indeed, if he saw she was there, reading a book, he would ask her, as gently as any one could, Was there nothing he could give her?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那么它是这个样子的，这座岛屿，卡姆又一次把手指放在海水里，心里在想。她还从来没有从海上看到过它。它是不是就那样躺在海面上，中间凹进去，旁边有两块陡峭的岩石，海水从那儿涌入，在岛的两边远远地伸展开去。岛很小；形状有点像片竖立着的树叶，于是我们乘上一条小船，她想像，开始给自己讲一个从沉船上逃生的历险故事。但是海水流过手指，一丛海藻消失在身后，此情此景，使她不愿给自己讲述一个严肃的故事；她需要的是历险和逃生的感觉，因为在小船行驶之时，她想着的是，她父亲因她不懂罗盘刻度而生气，詹姆斯在盟约上的固执，以及她自己的痛苦，现在一切都悄然离去，都成为了过去，都顺流而去了。那么接着而来的是什么呢？他们要到什么地方去呢？从深深插在水里的冰冷的手上涌出了一股快乐的泉水，这是来自心情的变化，来自能够逃生，来自历险（她竟然还活着，他竟然在这儿）。从这个不可思议突然涌出的快乐的泉水中洒下的水滴，散落在她心中黑黑的、昏昏欲睡的形影上；它们属于一个未被理解的世界，在黑暗中旋转，时而从这里或那里捕捉到一个火星；希腊、罗马、君士坦丁堡。尽管它很小，形状像一片竖立着的树叶，洒满金光的海水涌入海湾、在它的四周流动，她设想它在宇宙中也有着一席之地——即便是这样的一个小岛，对吗？她想在书房里的那些老先生是能够告诉她的。有时候她故意从花园进到里面去，就是为了看看他们在干什么。他们都在那里（可能是卡迈克尔先生或班克斯先生，又老又呆板），面对面坐在矮扶手椅上。她从花园进来的时候看见他们面前的《泰晤士报》乱七八槽，被翻得嚓嚓响，报上某人说了关于耶酥基督的什么事；在伦敦街上挖出了一头猛犸象；或者猜测伟大的拿破仑长得什么样？然后他们用干净的手指（他们穿着灰颜色的衣服；身上有股石南植物的香气）把散乱的报纸归拢在一起翻阅，跷起二郎腿，偶尔简短地说句什么。她神情恍忽地从书架上拿下一本书来然后站在那儿，看她父亲写东西，他写得均匀整齐，从纸的一头写到另一头，偶尔咳嗽一声，或和对面的老先生简短地说上两句。她站在那里，书摊开着，心想，在这里，你可以让不论什么思想都像一片泡在水里的叶子一样伸展开来；如果你的思想在抽着烟的老先生和嚓嚓作响的《泰晤士报》之间进展良好的话，那么它就是正确的。看着父亲在书房里写东西，她想（现在是坐在船上）他最可爱，他最有智慧；他既不自负也不是个暴君。真的，如果他看见她在那里，在读着一本书，他会和任何人一样温和地问她，难道她不需要他给她点什么帮助吗？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Lest this should be wrong, she looked at him reading the little book with the shiny cover mottled like a plover's egg. No; it was right. Look at him now, she wanted to say aloud to James. (But James had his eye on the sail.) He is a sarcastic brute, James would say. He brings the talk round to himself and his books, James would say. He is intolerably egotistical. Worst of all, he is a tyrant. But look! she said, looking at him. Look at him now. She looked at him reading the little book with his legs curled; the little book whose yellowish pages she knew, without knowing what was written on them. It was small; it was closely printed; on the fly-leaf, she knew, he had written that he had spent fifteen francs on dinner; the wine had been so much; he had given so much to the waiter; all was added up neatly at the bottom of the page. But what might be written in the book which had rounded its edges off in his pocket, she did not know. What he thought they none of them knew. But he was absorbed in it, so that when he looked up, as he did now for an instant, it was not to see anything; it was to pin down some thought more exactly. That done, his mind flew back again and he plunged into his reading. He read, she thought, as if he were guiding something, or wheedling a large flock of sheep, or pushing his way up and up a single narrow path; and sometimes he went fast and straight, and broke his way through the bramble, and sometimes it seemed a branch struck at him, a bramble blinded him, but he was not going to let himself be beaten by that; on he went, tossing over page after page. And she went on telling herself a story about escaping from a sinking ship, for she was safe, while he sat there; safe, as she felt herself down, and the old gentleman, lowering the paper suddenly, said something very brief over the top of it about the character of Napoleon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她怕自己的想法错了，就看着正在读那本封面亮亮的有像鹬鸟蛋一样杂色花纹的小书的父亲。不，没有错。现在再看看他吧，她想大声对詹姆斯说。（但是詹姆斯的眼睛盯在船帆上。）他是一个爱挖苦人的畜生，詹姆斯会说。他总把谈话引到他自己和他的书上，詹姆斯会说。他是个令人难以忍受的利己主义者。最糟糕的是，他是个暴君。但是你看！她说，眼睛看着他。现在你再看看他。她看着他蜷着腿读那本小书；她熟悉那本小书的发黄的书页，却不知道上面写的是什么。书上的字很小，印得密密麻麻的；她知道在书的衬页上。他写着晚饭花了十五个法郎；葡萄酒是多少钱；小费给了多少；所有的花销都整整齐齐地加好写在了页末。但是这本在他的口袋里放得磨圆了书角的书中写的是什么，她却一点都不知道，他心里想的是什么他们谁都不知道。但他全神贯注在这本书中，以至于当他抬起头来时，就像现在这样，也不是为了看什么东西，而是为了更准确地搞清某个想法。搞清了以后，他的思想又飞了回去，埋头继续看起书来。他读书的时候，她想，就像是在带领着什么东西、或是哄赶着一群羊、或是在一条狭窄的小路上不断奋力攀登；有时走得又直又快，披荆斩棘前行，有时又似乎被树枝撞了、被荆棘刺痛了眼睛，但他可不会让这些东西战胜自己；他继续前进，翻过一页又一页。她则继续给自己讲述一个关于从沉船上逃生的故事，因为当他坐在那儿时她感到安全；安全，就和当年她从花园悄悄溜进房间去时的感觉一样，那时她拿下一本书，而那位老先生突然放低手里拿的报纸，简要地说了些关于拿破仑的性格的话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She gazed back over the sea, at the island. But the leaf was losing its sharpness. It was very small; it was very distant. The sea was more important now than the shore. Waves were all round them, tossing and sinking, with a log wallowing down one wave; a gull riding on another. About here, she thought, dabbling her fingers in the water, a ship had sunk, and she murmured, dreamily half asleep, how we perished, each alone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她回过头越过海面凝视着那座小岛。但见这片树叶的轮廓已开始模糊。岛非常小；非常遥远。现在大海已经比海岸更为显要。波浪在他们四周起伏翻腾，一根木头在一个波谷中翻滚；一只海鸥在一个浪峰上飞翔。她手指玩着水，心里想，大概就在这里沉下过一条船，她梦一般恍惚地喃喃道，我们死去了，各自孤零零地死去。">查看中文翻译</div>
