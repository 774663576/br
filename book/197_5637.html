<div class="line_en">Harry dressed as quickly as he could and hurried off to Gryffindor Tower, desperate to tell Ron and Hermione about Colin and Dobby, but they weren't there. Harry left to look for them, wondering where they could have got to and feeling slightly hurt that they weren't interested in whether he had his bones back or not.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利尽可能麻利地穿上衣服，匆匆赶向格兰芬多塔楼，巴不得赶紧跟罗恩和赫敏说说科林和多比的情况，可是他们不在那儿。哈利又出去寻找，心里纳闷，他们能去哪儿呢？他觉得有点儿委屈，他们竟然丝毫也不关心他的骨头长好了没有。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"All in order," she said as he clumsily fed himself porridge lefthanded. "When you've finished eating, you may leave."</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry woke up on Sunday morning to find the dormitory blazing with winter sunlight and his arm reboned but very stiff. He sat up quickly and looked over at Colin's bed, but it had been blocked from view by the high curtains Harry had changed behind yesterday. Seeing that he was awake, Madam Pomfrey came bustling over with a breakfast tray and then began bending and stretching his arm and fingers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="星期天一早，哈利一睁眼，看见冬目的阳光照得宿舍里亮堂堂的。他发现他的胳膊又长出了新骨头，但十分僵硬。他猛地坐起身，朝科林的床上望去，可是哈利床前昨天新换上的长长的帘子，把科林的床完全遮住了。庞弗雷夫人看到哈利醒了，便端着早餐托盘，轻快地走过来，然后开始拉曲伸展他的胳膊和手指。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry forced a laugh, watched Percy walk out of sight, and then headed straight for Moaning Myrtle's bathroom. He couldn't see why Ron and Hermione would be in there again, but after making sure that neither Filch nor any prefects were around, he opened the door and heard their voices coming from a locked stall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利勉强笑了一下，看着珀西离去，然后他走向哭泣的桃金娘的盥洗室。他说不清罗恩和赫敏为什么又会到这里来，但当他确信费尔奇和年级长都不在周围时，便推开了房门。他听见一个小单间里传出了他们的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Fine," said Harry, squeezing into the stall. An old cauldron was perched on the toilet, and a crackling from under the rim told Harry they had lit a fire beneath it. Conjuring up portable, waterproof fires was a speciality of Hermione's.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“挺好。”哈利说着，挤进了小单间。只见抽水马桶上架着一只坩埚，哈利听到马桶下面传出噼噼啪啪的声音，便知道他们在下面生了一把火。用魔法变出可携带的防水的火，这是赫敏的拿手好戏。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, I haven't," said Percy, his smile fading. "I hope Ron's not in another girls' toilet…"</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's me," he said, closing the door behind him. There was a clunk, a splash, and a gasp from within the stall and he saw Hermione's eye peering through the keyhole.</div>

<div class="line_en">"We'd've come to meet you, but we decided to get started on the Polyjuice Potion," Ron explained as Harry, with difficulty, locked the stall again. "We've decided this is the safest place to hide it."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我们最好赶紧让马尔福坦白交待，越快越好。”罗恩气冲冲地说，“你知道我是怎么想的吗？自从魁地奇比赛之后，他就一直闷闷不乐，他是把气撒在科林身上了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“密室以前曾经打开过？”赫敏说。">查看中文翻译</div>

It's obvious. Wish Dobby'd told you what kind of monster's in there, though. I want to know how come nobody's noticed it sneaking around the school."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这下就清楚了，”罗恩用得意的语气说，“卢修斯马尔福一定是在这里上学的时候就打开过秘室，现在他又教亲爱的小德拉科这么做。这是很显然的。不过，我真希望多比告诉过你那里面关着什么怪物。我真不明白，它在学校里偷偷地走来走去，怎么就没有人发现呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You read too much, Hermione," said Ron, pouring dead lacewings on top of the leeches. He crumpled up the empty lacewing bag and looked at Harry.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ginny Weasley, who sat next to Colin Creevey in Charms, was distraught, but Harry felt that Fred and George were going the wrong way about cheering her up. They were taking turns covering themselves with fur or boils and jumping out at her from behind statues. They only stopped when Percy, apoplectic with rage, told them he was going to write to Mrs. Weasley and tell her Ginny was having nightmares.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="金妮在魔咒班上与科林克里维同桌，这会儿心烦意乱得厉害。弗雷德和乔治为了使她高兴，轮流披着羽毛或变出满身疥疮，从塑像后面跳出来逗她，哈利觉得这种做法是在帮倒忙。后来，珀西气得语无伦次，对他们说他要写信给他们的妈妈韦斯莱夫人，告诉她金妮夜里都做噩梦，他们这才停止了胡闹。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"So Dobby stopped us from getting on the train and broke your arm…" He shook his head. "You know what, Harry? If he doesn't stop trying to save your life he's going to kill you." The news that Colin Creevey had been attacked and was now lying as though dead in the hospital wing had spread through the entire school by Monday morning. The air was suddenly thick with rumor and suspicion. The first years were now moving around the castle in tight-knit groups, as though scared they would be attacked if they ventured forth alone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“所以多比不让我们上火车，还弄断了你的胳膊…”他摇了摇头，“你知道吗，哈利？如果他一直不停地抢救你，就会要了你的命。”星期一早晨，科林克里维遭到袭击、现在像死人一样躺在病房里的消息，一下子传遍了学校。顿时，学校里谣言纷飞，人人疑神疑鬼。一年级新生现在总是三五成群地紧紧簇拥在一起活动，好像生怕如果他们单独行动，就会受到袭击。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Maybe it can make itself invisible," said Hermione, prodding leeches to the bottom of the cauldron. "Or maybe it can disguise itself -- pretend to be a suit of armor or something -- I've read about Chameleon Ghouls --"</div>

<div class="line_en">Meanwhile, hidden from the teachers, a roaring trade in talismans, amulets, and other protective devices was sweeping the school. Neville Longbottom bought a large, evil-smelling green onion, a pointed purple crystal, and a rotting newt tail before the other Gryffindor boys pointed out that he was in no danger; he was a pureblood, and therefore unlikely to be attacked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这段时间里，大家瞒着老师，叽叽喳喳地交换护身符、驱邪物及其他保护自己的玩艺儿。这种做法很快就风靡学校，纳威隆巴顿买了一只臭气熏天的大洋葱、一枚尖尖的紫水晶和一条正在腐烂的水螈尾巴。结果格兰芬多的其他男生们告诉他，他实际上并没有危险——他是纯正血统，因此不会受到袭击。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"They went for Filch first," Neville said, his round face fearful. "And everyone knows I'm almost a Squib." In the second week of December Professor McGonagall came around as usual, collecting names of those who would be staying at school for Christmas. Harry, Ron, and Hermione signed her list; they had heard that Malfoy was staying, which struck them as very suspicious. The holidays would be the perfect time to use the Polyjuice Potion and try to worm a confession out of him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他们先对费尔奇下手，”纳威说，他圆圆的脸上充满了恐惧，“大家都知道，我差不多就是个哑炮。”十二月的第二个星期，麦格教授像往常一样过来收集留校过圣诞节的同学名单。哈利、罗恩和赫敏在名单上签了字；他们听说马尔福准备留下，觉得很值得怀疑。过节期间正好可以使用复方汤剂，把马尔福的真话套出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Unfortunately, the potion was only half finished. They still needed the bicorn horn and the boomslang skin, and the only place they were going to get them was from Snape's private stores. Harry privately felt he'd rather face Slytherin's legendary monster than let Snape catch him robbing his office.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不幸的是，汤剂还没有完全熬好。他们还需要双角兽的角和非洲树蛇的皮，而这些东西只有在斯内普的私人储藏室里才能弄到。哈利暗地里觉得，他宁愿面对斯莱特林的神奇的怪物，也不愿在斯内普办公室里偷东西时被斯内普抓住。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I think I'd better do the actual stealing," Hermione continued in a matter-of-fact tone. "You two will be expelled if you get into any more trouble, and I've got a clean record. So all you need to do is cause enough mayhem to keep Snape busy for five minutes or so."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我认为最好由我着手去偷，”赫敏用公事公办的口吻接着说，“你们俩如果再惹麻烦，就要被开除了，而我没有前科记录。所以，你们只要把课堂搅得一阵大乱，让斯内普有五分钟时间忙得脱不开身。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What we need," said Hermione briskly as Thursday afternoon's double Potions lesson loomed nearer, "is a diversion. Then one of us can sneak into Snape's office and take what we need."</div>

<div class="line_en">Potions lessons took place in one of the large dungeons. Thursday afternoon's lesson proceeded in the usual way. Twenty cauldrons stood steaming between the wooden desks, on which stood brass scales and jars of ingredients. Snape prowled through the fumes, making waspish remarks about the Gryffindors' work while the Slytherins sniggered appreciatively. Draco Malfoy, who was Snape's favorite student, kept flicking puffer-fish eyes at Ron and Harry, who knew that if they retaliated they would get detention faster than you could say "Unfair."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="魔药课是在一个大地下教室里上的。星期四下午的课开始的时候就像往常一样。木桌之间竖着二十个坩埚，桌上放着铜天平和一罐一罐的配料。斯内普在一片烟雾缭绕中来回巡视，粗暴地对格兰芬多学生的工作提出批评，斯莱特林学生在一旁幸灾乐祸地窃笑。德拉科马尔福是斯内普的得意门生，他不停地用他的金鱼眼睛朝罗恩和哈利翻白眼。罗恩和哈利知道，如果他们以眼还眼，就会立刻被关禁闭，连句“冤枉”都来不及喊。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry's Swelling Solution was far too runny, but he had his mind on more important things.

When Snape turned and walked off to bully Neville, Hermione caught Harry's eye and nodded.</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry ducked swiftly down behind his cauldron, pulled one of Fred's Filibuster fireworks out of his pocket, and gave it a quick prod with his wand.

<div class="line_cn" title="哈利迅速弯腰藏到他的坩埚后面，从口袋里掏出一串弗雷德的费力拔烟火，用魔杖飞快地点了一下。烟火开始嘶嘶作响，迸出火星。哈利知道自己只有几秒钟的时间，便直起身，瞄准目标，把烟火掷了出去。烟火准确地落进了高尔的锅里。">查看中文翻译</div>

Professor McGonagall was shouting at someone who, by the sound of it, had turned his friend into a badger.

<div class="line_en">Justin Finch-Fletchley was lying on the floor, rigid and cold, a look of shock frozen on his face, his eyes staring blankly at the ceiling. And that wasn't all. Next to him was another figure, the strangest sight Harry had ever seen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="贾斯廷芬列里躺在地板上，浑身冰冷、僵硬，一种惊恐万状的神情凝固在他脸上，他的眼睛呆滞地盯着天花板。这还不算完，他旁边还有一个人物，哈利从未见过这样离奇怪异的景象。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was Nearly Headless Nick, no longer pearly-white and transparent, but black and smoky, floating immobile and horizontal, six inches off the floor. His head was half off and his face wore an expression of shock identical to Justin's.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那是差点没头的尼克，他不再是乳白色和透明的了，而变得浑身乌黑，烟雾缭绕，一动不动地平躺着悬浮在离地面六英寸的地方。他的脑袋掉了一半，脸上带着与贾斯廷一模一样的惊恐表情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry got to his feet, his breathing fast and shallow, his heart doing a kind of drumroll against his ribs. He looked wildly up and down the deserted corridor and saw a line of spiders scuttling as fast as they could away from the bodies. The only sounds were the muffled voices of teachers from the classes on either side.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利赶紧站起来，呼吸急促，心脏狂跳，像一面小鼓在胸腔里敲击。他迷乱地在空荡荡的走廊里四下张望，只见一行蜘蛛急匆匆地拼命逃走了。他听不见别的声音，只有走廊另一头教室里隐约传来老师的说话声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Peeves stopped, halfway through a midair somersault. Upside down, he spotted Justin and Nearly Headless Nick.

<div class="line_en">Crash -- crash -- crash -- door after door flew open along the corridor and people flooded out. For several long minutes, there was a scene of such confusion that Justin was in danger of being squashed and people kept standing in Nearly Headless Nick. Harry found himself pinned against the wall as the teachers shouted for quiet. Professor McGonagall came running, followed by her own class, one of whom still had black-and-white-striped hair. She used her wand to set off a loud bang, which restored silence, and ordered everyone back into their classes. No sooner had the scene cleared somewhat than Ernie the Hufflepuff arrived, panting, on the scene.</div>

<div class="line_en">Justin was carried up to the hospital wing by Professor Flitwick and Professor Sinistra of the Astronomy department, but nobody seemed to know what to do for Nearly Headless Nick. In the end, Professor McGonagall conjured a large fan out of thin air, which she gave to Ernie with instructions to waft Nearly Headless Nick up the stairs. This Ernie did, fanning Nick along like a silent black hovercraft. This left Harry and Professor McGonagall alone together.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Lemon drop!" she said. This was evidently a password, because the gargoyle sprang suddenly to life and hopped aside as the wall behind him split in two. Even full of dread for what was coming, Harry couldn't fail to be amazed. Behind the wall was a spiral staircase that was moving smoothly upward, like an escalator. As he and Professor McGonagall stepped onto it, Harry heard the wall thud closed behind them. They rose upward in circles, higher and higher, until at last, slightly dizzy, Harry saw a gleaming oak door ahead, with a brass knocker in the shape of a griffin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“冰镇柠檬汁！”她说。这显然是一句口令，只见怪兽突然活了起来，跳到一旁，它身后的墙壁裂成了两半。哈利尽管为即将到来的命运忧心忡忡，却也忍不住暗暗称奇。墙后面是一道旋转楼梯，正在缓缓地向上移动，就像自动扶梯一样。哈利和麦格教授一踏上去，就听见后面轰隆一声，墙又合上了。他们旋转着越升越高，越升越高，最后，感到有些头晕的哈利看见前面有一道闪闪发亮的栎木门，上面是一个狮身鹰首兽形状的黄铜门环。">查看中文翻译</div>
