<div class="line_en">"Well, hats off to your stylist. I don't think anyone can argue that that's not the most spectacular thing we've ever seen in an interview. Cinna, I think you better take a bow!" Caesar gestures for Cinna to rise. He does, and makes a small, gracious bow. And suddenly I am so afraid for him. What has he done? Something terribly dangerous. An act of rebellion in itself. And he's done it for me. I remember his words…</div>

<div class="line_en">I'm still smoldering a little, so it's with a tentative hand that Caesar reaches out to touch my headpiece. The white has burned away, leaving a smooth, fitted veil of black that drapes into the neckline of the dress in the back. "Feathers," says Caesar. "You're like a bird."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="衣服燃烧之后还有些热，所以凯撒试探性地伸出手来触摸我的头饰。白色的面纱已经不见了，现在戴在头上的是垂到我的后颈的光滑的面纱。“羽毛，”凯撒说，“你就像一只鸟。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Caesar and Peeta have been a natural team since they first appeared together a year ago. Their easy give-and-take, comic timing, and ability to segue into heart-wrenching moments, like Peeta's confession of love for me, have made them a huge success with the audience. They effortlessly open with a few jokes about fires and feathers and overcooking poultry. But anyone can see that Peeta is preoccupied, so Caesar directs the conversation right into the subject that's on everyone's minds.</div>

"And to us, we're more married than any piece of paper or big party could make us."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，我们谁也没告诉，甚至没告诉黑密斯。凯特尼斯的妈妈永远都不可能同意我们这么做的。可你知道，如果我们在凯匹特举行婚礼，我们就不可能举行吃烤面包的仪式，可我们俩谁也不想再等了。所以，有一天，我们就这么做了。”皮塔说道，“对我们而言，这比任何纸质的证明或婚礼宴会来得更真实。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There. He's done it again. Dropped a bomb that wipes out the efforts of every tribute who came before him. Well, maybe not. Maybe this year he has only lit the fuse on a bomb that the victors themselves have been building. Hoping someone would be able to detonate it. Perhaps thinking it would be me in my bridal gown. Not knowing how much I rely on Cinna's talents, whereas Peeta needs nothing more than his wits.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="天哪，他又来啦。他扔下了一颗重磅炸弹，使其他“贡品”所说的一切都显得不那么重要了。噢，也许不是。也许今年是其他人一起制造了这颗炸弹，而他只是点着了引信。本以为点着这引信的是我，还要仰仗西纳的力量；而他却完全靠自己的智慧做到了这一点。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As the bomb explodes, it sends accusations of injustice and barbarism and cruelty flying out in every direction. Even the most Capitol-loving, Games-hungry, bloodthirsty person out there can't ignore, at least for a moment, how horrific the whole thing is.</div>

<div class="line_en">The audience can't absorb the news right away.

I know my face is projected in a tight close-up on the screen, but I don't make any effort to hide it. Because for a moment, even I am working through what Peeta has said. Isn't it the thing I dreaded most about the wedding, about the future -- the loss of my children to the Games? And it could be true now, couldn't it? If I hadn't spent my life building up layers of defenses until I recoil at even the suggestion of marriage or a family?</div>

I can see Caesar's lips moving, but the place is in total chaos and I can't hear a word. Only the blast of the anthem, cranked up so loud I can feel it vibrating through my bones, lets us know where we stand in the program. I automatically rise and, as I do, I sense Peeta reaching out for me. Tears run down his face as I take his hand. How real are the tears? Is this an acknowledgment that he has been stalked by the same fears that I have? That every victor has? Every parent in every district in Panem?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯撒已经无法控制观众的情绪，蜂鸣器嘀嘀作响，但无人理睬。皮塔点头示意与观众再见，然后无声地回到自己的座位上。我看到凯撒的嘴唇在动，但现场非常混乱，根本听不到一点声音。最后国歌响起，声音非常大，震得我感到浑身的肌肉都在颤抖。这声音告诉我们节目进行到了哪里。我不由自主地站了起来，皮塔向我伸出了手，我拉住了他的手，看到他泪流满面。他的眼泪有多少是真的？这是不是说他和我有着同样的恐惧？是不是每个胜利者都有？是不是每个区的每个家庭都有？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I look back to the crowd, but the faces of Rue's mother and father swim before my eyes. Their sorrow. Their loss. I turn spontaneously to Chaff and offer my hand. I feel my fingers close around the stump that now completes his arm and hold fast.</div>

<div class="line_en">And then it happens. Up and down the row, the victors begin to join hands. Some right away, like the morphlings, or Wiress and Beetee. Others unsure but caught up in the demands of those around them, like Brutus and Enobaria. By the time the anthem plays its final strains, all twenty-four of us stand in one unbroken line in what must be the first public show of unity among the districts since the Dark Days. You can see the realization of this as the screens begin to pop into blackness. It's too late, though. In the confusion they didn't cut us off in time. Everyone has seen.</div>

<div class="line_en">We cross the room, but in the doorway, Haymitch's voice stops us. "Katniss, when you're in the arena," he begins. Then he pauses. He's scowling in a way that makes me sure I've already disappointed him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Do we sleep? I don't know. We spend the night holding each other, in some halfway land between dreams and waking. Not talking. Both afraid to disturb the other in the hope that we'll be able to store up a few precious minutes of rest.</div>

<div class="line_en">The electric current freezes me in place on the ladder until the doctor injects the tracker into my left forearm. Now they will always be able to locate me in the arena. The hovercraft takes off, and I look out the windows until they black out. Cinna keeps pressing me to eat and, when that fails, to drink. I manage to keep sipping water, thinking of the days of dehydration that almost killed me last year. Thinking of how I will need my strength to keep Peeta alive.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="电流把我固定在直升机的梯子上，后来医生又在我左前臂注射了追踪器。现在，无论我在竞技场的任何地方，他们都可以找到我。接着西纳也上了直升机。直升机起飞了，我目视着窗外，直至一切都模糊成一个个小黑点。西纳一直要我多吃点，我实在吃不下去，他又让我多喝点，我一直小口喝水，脑子里回想着去年我脱水，差点渴死的情形，琢磨着怎样才能让皮塔活下去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What do you think?" I ask, holding the fabric out for Cinna to examine.</div>

<div class="line_en">When we reach the Launch Room at the arena, I shower. Cinna braids my hair down my back and helps me dress over simple undergarments.

A pair of nylon shoes with rubber soles.</div>

He kisses my forehead and steps back as the glass cylinder slides down around me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们像去年一样，坐在那里，拉着手。一个声音传来，要我做好准备。西纳把我送到金属圆盘旁，把我衣领的拉链拉好。“记住，燃烧的女孩，”他说，“我还赌你赢。”他在我的前额吻了一下，向后退了一步，玻璃罩落下，将我罩住。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sickened and terrified, I feel the plate begin to rise. I'm still leaning against the glass when the breeze catches my hair and I force myself to straighten up. Just in time, too, because the glass is retreating and I'm standing free in the arena. Something seems to be wrong with my vision. The ground is too bright and shiny and keeps undulating. I squint down at my feet and see that my metal plate is surrounded by blue waves that lap up over my boots. Slowly I raise my eyes and take in the water spreading out in every direction.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我感到又恐惧又难过。这时金属盘开始上升了。我还靠在玻璃上，风吹动了我的头发，我强迫自己站起来。刚好，玻璃罩打开，我已经站到了竞技场里。可是，我看不清眼前的一切。地面极亮，金光闪闪，好像还有荡漾的波纹。我眯着眼看自己脚下的地面，看到金属盘被蓝色的水波环绕，水波拍打着我的鞋子。我慢慢抬起头，看到了一望无际水的世界。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Suddenly the door behind him bursts open and three Peacekeepers spring into the room. Two pin Cinna's arms behind him and cuff him while the third hits him in the temple with such force he's knocked to his knees. But they keep hitting him with metal-studded gloves, opening gashes on his face and body. I'm screaming my head off, banging on the unyielding glass, trying to reach him. The Peacekeepers ignore me completely as they drag Cinna's limp body from the room. All that's left are the smears of blood on the floor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然，西纳身后的门打开了，三个治安警冲到屋子里。其中两个反剪住西纳的胳膊，戴上手铐，第三个人在他的太阳穴上猛击，西纳一下子跪倒在地上。可他们还用布满金属扣钉的手套打他，在他的脸上和身上划下了一道道的口子。我凄惨地大声嘶喊，用手捶打着坚固的玻璃，我想抓住他。治安警根本不理我，他们把西纳单薄的身体拖出了房间。屋子里只留下了片片血污。">查看中文翻译</div>
