<div class="line_en">"Good morning, Miss Earp," said Denry, when she opened the door. "I've come about the rent."</div>

<div class="line_en">One day in July Denry knocked at the door of a house at the top of Brougham Street. The dancing teacher, Miss Ruth Earp, lived there, in a house owned by Mr Calvert, and Denry now collected Mr Calvert's rents for him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="七月的一天，邓瑞敲响了布鲁厄姆街尽头的一所房子的大门。舞蹈老师露丝·厄普小姐就住在那里，那是卡尔弗特先生的房子，现在邓瑞为卡尔弗特先生收房租。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ruth Earp gave a hard little laugh. "I see," she said. "so Mr Herbert Calvert is paying you to do his dirty work now. I must tell you, Mr Machin, that not long ago Mr Calvert was more interested in me than in my rent. But when I decided that I could not return his interest, he said things which hurt me very much -- very much indeed."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="露丝·厄普勉强笑了一下。“我明白了。”她说，“这么说赫伯特·卡尔弗特现在雇你来给他干这份脏活了。我必须告诉你，梅钦先生，不久前卡尔弗特先生对我比对我的房租更感兴趣。但当我决定不能对他的兴趣作出回报时，他说了一些非常伤人的话——非常非常伤人。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes. I collect rents for Mr Calvert now," Denry said. He did not like the "little boy" look on her face, and added, "You haven't paid any rent for more than a year."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的。我现在为卡尔弗特先生收房租。”邓瑞说道。他不喜欢她看他时露出像看“小毛孩”的表情，于是又补充道：“你都一年多没交房租了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The rent?" said Ruth, surprised. She gave him a look which seemed to say, "Why does a little boy like you ask about my rent?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“房租？”露丝说，显得十分惊讶。她看了他一眼，那表情似乎在说：“怎么让你这样一个小毛孩来找我要房租？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But if you can't pay your rent, Miss Earp, I'm afraid you'll have to leave."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可你要是交不出房租，厄普小姐，恐怕就得搬走了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh," said Denry. He told himself that he was here on business.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ruth had introduced Denry to dancing, and now she introduced him to taking tea. It was all very beautifully done -- tea in very small cups, little squares of bread-and-butter, and interesting conversation. Ruth seemed much more friendly today, and Denry found it all very pleasant.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="露丝曾教过邓瑞跳舞，现在又教他喝茶。一切都布置得很精美——茶装在小巧的茶杯里，抹了黄油的面包切成一小块一小块的，还有风趣的谈话。露丝今天看起来友善得多，邓瑞觉得这一切都让人舒服极了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Is something the matter?" asked Denry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你怎么啦？”邓瑞问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ruth looked at him, and then gave a slow, sad smile. "Of course I can pay it," she said gently. "I just wanted to punish Mr Calvert a little. I can't pay you just at this moment, I'm afraid. The bank is closed. Can you come back tomorrow? Come at four o'clock, and I'll give you a cup of tea."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="露丝看着他，慢慢露出悲伤的笑容。“我当然交得起。”她温柔地说，“我只是想给卡尔弗特先生一点颜色看看。恐怕现在我不能给你现钱，银行关门了。你能明天来吗？你四点来，我请你喝杯茶。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The next day Denry returned. It was the first time he had taken tea with a young lady, and so he had put on his best summer suit. He noticed that Ruth was wearing a very pretty dress -- something white with bits of pink in it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天邓瑞又来了。这是他第一次和年轻女士喝茶，因此他穿上了自己最好的一身夏装。他注意到露丝穿了一条漂亮的裙子——那是条白底粉点的裙子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then suddenly Ruth stopped speaking, and lay back in her chair with her eyes closed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然露丝不再说话，靠在椅子里，闭上了眼睛。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“可我得先给你房租。”她手掩额头，“钱在桌子里，你能帮我拿过来吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="她给了邓瑞一把钥匙。他走到桌子那里，把钥匙插进锁里，试着打开。钥匙转了又转，但锁打不开。“我打不开。”他说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ruth stood up, holding her head. She came over to the desk, and tried the key. "Oh dear. I'm afraid you've broken the lock. I'll have to get someone to mend it tomorrow morning, and then I'll bring the money round to you."</div>

<div class="line_en">Late that night Denry came home from an evening at the Sports Club and just as he reached his mother's house, he saw something strange at the top end of Brougham Street. A large furniture van was moving down the street all on its own; there were no horses. Clearly, the owner had left it there and forgotten to put on the brakes. It was moving slowly now, but Denry could see that when it reached the bottom of Brougham Street, it could be very dangerous.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天深夜，邓瑞在体育俱乐部消磨了一个晚上准备回家，快走到他母亲家时，他在布鲁厄姆街尽头发现一件奇怪的事情。一辆运家具的拖车自己沿着街道向下滑行；车前没有套马。很明显，车主把车放在那里，忘记刹闸了。拖车现在移动得很慢，但邓瑞知道一旦车到达布鲁厄姆街的尽头，情况会非常危险。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“好啊，好啊！”他大声自言自语。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Denry was always at his finest at difficult or dangerous moments. As the van passed him, moving at about five or six kilometres an hour, he jumped on, losing his hat, and tried to put the brakes on. For a second or two the van seemed to slow down, but then Denry realized that the brakes were not working and the van was moving faster and faster down the hill. At the bottom of the street was the canal, and clearly nothing was going to stop the van now. It was too late to jump off, so Denry closed his eyes and held on hard.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在危难时刻，邓瑞总是特别善于应对。当拖车以每小时五六公里的速度经过邓瑞身边时，他跳上了车，帽子掉了也顾不上，一心只想试着把闸刹住。有那么一两秒钟，车子似乎慢了下来，但接着邓瑞意识到刹车失灵了，拖车正以越来越快的速度朝山下冲去。街的尽头就是运河，显然现在没有什么能阻止拖车前进了。现在跳车已经来不及了，邓瑞闭上眼睛，紧紧地抓住了车身。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When the van went in, Denry was under water for a moment, but then he managed to climb further up on the front of the van. Everything was still and dark, except for a little starlight on the water. Only Denry had seen the van's strange journey down the hill.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当拖车掉进河里时，邓瑞沉入了水中，但一会儿他就向上爬到车子的前端。除了水面的一点星光，四周静谧，一片漆黑。只有邓瑞目睹了拖车冲下山坡的奇特过程。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was Ruth Earp's voice. Denry understood immediately. Ruth had played with him! She had planned to take her furniture and run away in the night. She had no rent money locked in her desk at all. But he was not angry with her, just amused. Ruth was really very clever -- in fact, very like Denry himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那是露丝·厄普的声音。邓瑞立刻就明白了。露丝一直在耍他！她打算带着家具，趁着夜色逃走。她的桌子里根本没有锁着房租。但他不生她的气，只是觉得好笑。露丝真的非常聪明——事实上，她跟邓瑞很像。">查看中文翻译</div>
