<div class="line_en">If anything at all can be said in favour of solitary, it's just that you get time to think. Andy had twenty days in which to think while he enjoyed his grain and drain, and when he got out he requested another meeting with the warden. Request denied. Such a meeting, the warden told him, would be "counter-productive". That's another of those phrases you have to master before you can go to work in the prisons and corrections field.</div>

<div class="line_en">Patiently, Andy renewed his request. And renewed it. And renewed it. He had changed, had Andy Dufresne. Suddenly, as that spring of 1963 bloomed around us, there were lines in his face and sprigs of grey showing in his hair. He had lost that little trace of a smile that always seemed to linger around his mouth. His eyes stared out into space more often, and you get to know that when a man stares that way, he is counting up the years served, the months, the weeks, the days.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="安迪很有耐心地再度求见典狱长，接着再度提出请求。他变了。一九六三年，当春回大地的时候，安迪脸上出现了皱纹，头上长出灰发，嘴角惯有的微笑也不见了。目光茫然一片。当一个人开始像这样发呆时，你知道他正在数着他已经度过了多少年、多少月、多少星期，甚至多少天的牢狱之灾。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He renewed his request, and renewed i. t He was patient. He had nothing but time. It got to be summer. In Washington, President Kennedy was promising a fresh assault on poverty and on civil rights inequalities, not knowing he had only half a year to live. In Liverpool, a musical group called The Beatles was emerging as a force to be reckoned with in British music, but I guess that no one Stateside had yet heard of them. The Boston Red Sox, still four years away from what New England folks call The Miracle of '67, were languishing in the cellar of the American League. All of those things were going on out in a larger world where people walked free.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他很有耐性，不断提出请求。他除了时间之外一无所有。夏天到了，肯尼迪总统在华盛顿首府承诺将大力扫除贫穷和消除不平等，浑然不知自己只剩下半年的寿命了。在英国利物浦，一个名叫“披头士”的合唱团正冒出头来，但在美国，还没有人知道披头士是何方神圣。还有波士顿红袜队这时仍然在美国联盟垫底，还要再过四年，才到了新英格兰人所说的“一九六七奇迹年”。所有这些事情都发生在外面那个广大的自由世界里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“够了，”诺顿打断道。他的脸拉得老长，冷得像墓碑，他拼命往椅背上靠，后脑勺几乎碰到墙上那幅写着“主的审判就要来临”的刺绣。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well now, when I need a sorry son of a bitch like you to set my mind at ease, I'll retire. I agreed to this appointment because I got tired of being pestered, ufresne. I want it to stop. If you want to buy this particular Brooklyn Bridge, that's your affair. Don't make it mine. I could hear crazy stories like yours twice a week if I wanted to lay myself open to them. Every sinner in this place would be using me for a crying towel. I had more respect for you. But this is the end. The end. Have we got an understanding?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“呐，我要是需要一个成天哭丧着脸的龟儿子来安我的心，那我不如退休算了。我同意和你见面，是因为我已经厌倦了和你继续纠缠下去，杜佛尼，你要适可而止。如果你想要买下布鲁克林桥，那是你的事，别扯到我头上，如果我容许每个人来跟我说这些疯话，那么这里每个人都会来找我诉苦。我一向很尊重你，但这件事就到此为止了，你懂吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Don't you ever mention money to me again," Norton said. "Not in this office, not anywhere. Not unless you want to see that library turned back into a storage room and paint-locker again. Do you understand?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"I think we can put it together," Andy said. "With Tommy Williams and with my testimony and corroborative testimony from records and employees at the country club, I think we can put it together."</div>

<div class="line_en">"He's been transferred."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他转到别的监狱去了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At that, Andy fell silent. He was an intelligent man, but it would have taken an extraordinarily stupid man not to smelt deal all over that. Cashman was a minimum -security prison far up north in Aroostook County. The inmates pick a lot of potatoes, and that's hard work, but they are paid a decent wage for their labour and they can attend classes at CVI, a pretty decent vocational-technical institute, if they so desire. More important to a fellow like Tommy, a fellow with a young wife and a child, Cashman had a furlough programme… which meant a chance to live like a normal man, at least on the weekends. A chance to build a model plane with his kid, have sex with his wife, maybe go on a picnic.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="安迪陷入沉默。他是个聪明人，但如果你还嗅不出当中的各种交易条件的话，就真的太笨了。凯西门位于北边的阿鲁斯托库县，是个比较开放的监狱。那里的犯人平常需要挖马铃薯，虽然工作辛苦，不过却可以得到合理的报酬，而且如果他们愿意的话，还可以到学校参加各种技能训练。更重要的是，对像汤米这种有太太小孩的人，凯西门有一套休假制度，可以让他在周末时过着正常人的生活，换言之，他可以和太太亲热，和小孩一起建造模型飞机，或者全家出外野餐。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"As a favour to you," Norton said calmly, "I checked with Rhode Island. They did have an inmate named Elwood Blatch. He was given what they call a PP -- provisional parole, another one of these crazy liberal programmes to put criminals out on the streets. He's since disappeared."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我已经帮了你一个忙，”诺顿平静地说，“我查过罗德岛监狱，他们确实曾经有个叫布拉契的犯人，但由于所谓的‘暂时性假释计划’，他已经假释出狱了，从此不见踪影。这些自由派的疯狂计划简直放任罪犯在街头闲晃。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But why?" Andy said. "Why would --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“为什么？”安迪问，“你为什么——”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Norton had almost surely dangled all of that under Tommy's nose with only one string attached: not one more word about Elwood Blatch, not now, not ever. Or you'll end up doing hard time in Thomaston down there on scenic Route 1 with the real hard guys, and instead of having sex with your wife you'll be having it with some old bull queer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="诺顿一定是把这一切好处全摊在汤米面前，他对汤米的惟一要求是，从此不许再提布拉契三个字，否则就把他送到可怕的汤姆森监狱，不但无法和老婆亲热，反而得侍候一些老同性恋。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Because people like you make me sick," Norton said deliberately. "I like you right where you are, Mr Dufresne, and as long as I am warden here at Shawshank, you are going to be right here. You see, you used to think that you were better than anyone else. I have gotten pretty good at seeing that on a man's face. I marked it on yours the first time I walked into the library. It might as well have been written on your forehead in capital letters. That look is gone now, and I like that just fine. It is not just that you are a useful vessel, never think that. It is simply that men like you need to learn humility. Why, you used to walk around that exercise yard as if it was a living room and you were at one of those cocktail parties where the hellhound walk around coveting each others' wives and husbands and getting swinishly drunk. But you don't walk around that way anymore. And I'll be watching to see if you should start to walk that way again. Over a period of years, I'll be watching you with great pleasure. Now get the hell out of here."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“因为像你这种人让我觉得很恶心，”诺顿不慌不忙地说，“我喜欢你现在的状况，杜佛尼先生，而且只要我在肖申克当典狱长一天，你就得继续待在这里。从前你老是以为你比别人优秀，我很擅于从别人脸上看出这样的神情，从第一天走进图书馆的时候，我就注意到你脸上的优越感。现在，这种表情不见了，我觉得这样很好。你别老以为自己很有用，像你这种人需要学会谦虚一点。以前你在运动场上散步时，好像老把那里当成自家客厅，神气得像在参加鸡尾酒会，你在跟别人的先生或太太寒暄似的，但你现在不再带着那种神情走在路上了。我会继续注意你，看看你会不会又出现那种样子。未来几年，我会很乐意继续观察你的表现。现在给我滚出去！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Warden Norton's face first went brick-red… and then all the colour fell out of it "You're going back into solitary for that Thirty days. Bread and water. Another black mark. And while you're in, think about this: if anything that's been going on should stop, the library goes. I will make it my personal business to see that it goes back to what it was before you came here. And I will make your life… very hard. Very difficult. You'll do the hardest time it's possible to do. You'll lose that one-bunk Hilton down in Cellblock 5, for starters, and you'll lose those rocks on the windowsill, and you'll lose any protection the guards have given you against the sodomites. You will… lose everything. Clear?"</div>
