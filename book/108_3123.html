<div class="line_en">"But you know how it is. People have no respect at all for personal boundaries anymore. They charge into your house without knocking and cause a commotion, you can hardly even sit on the crapper in peace anymore," he explains, while he digs the frozen flowers out of the ground and presses down the new ones through the snow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但你知道现在的情况。如今没谁尊重个人隐私了，门都不敲就往人家里冲，自说自话，单独上个厕所都他妈难了。”他一边解释一边把冻僵的花挖出来，再插上新花。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Lena had come by Ove's house in the morning to drop off a copy of the newspaper. He was on the front page, looking like the archetypal grumpy old sod. He'd kept his word and let her interview him. But he wasn't smiling like a donkey for the camera; he told them that in no uncertain terms.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="女记者莱娜那天来过欧维家，给他送了一份报纸的样稿。照片里，他看上去气不打一处来。他信守诺言接受采访，但他不会冲摄影师笑得跟个驴似的，这他可事先打了招呼。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He looks at her as if he's expecting her to nod her agreement. But she doesn't, of course. The cat sits next to Ove in the snow and looks like it absolutely agrees. Especially with that bit about not being allowed to go to the toilet in peace.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ove merely nodded at this point, taking this as confirmation that the conversation was over, and closed the door. He put the newspaper under the doormat; it would come in handy for absorbing the snow and slush brought in by the cat and Mirsad.</div>

<div class="line_en">Back in the kitchen, he began clearing up all the advertising and free newspapers that Adrian had left with the day's mail (Sonja might have managed to teach the rascal to read Shakespeare, but apparently he could not understand a three-word sign that said "NO JUNK MAIL").</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="厨房里扔着阿德里安每天送信时捎带送来的广告和免费报纸，尽管欧维已经在信箱上贴了大号字体的“谢绝广告”标签。这句话的意思，显然是索雅没能教会那个小流氓，他不是她的学生嘛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Back then the youth rang the doorbell, at least -- nowadays he ran in and out of the door as if he lived here, Ove grumbled as he held the letter up to the kitchen lamp like a bank note being checked. Then he got out a table knife from the kitchen drawer. Even though Sonja got mad every time he used a table knife to open an envelope rather than fetching the letter opener.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那时候至少那个小流氓还打铃，现在他进出自如就跟他自己家似的。”欧维心想着，把信举到厨房灯下，就像那是一张纸币，而他的任务是检查一下它的真伪。然后他从橱柜里攥出一把餐刀来，尽管每次他这么做而不进屋拿拆信刀的时候，索雅都会生气。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I hope you'll excuse me contacting you like this. Lena at the newspaper has let me know that you don't want to make a big thing out of this but she was kind enough to give me your address. Because for me it was a big thing, and I don't want to be the sort of person who does not say that to you, Ove. I respect that you don't want to let me thank you personally, but at least I want to introduce you to some people who will always be grateful to you for your courage and selflessness. People like you are not made anymore. Thanks is too small a word.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="希望您能原谅我冒昧地来信。地方报社的莱娜告诉我您不希望小题大做，但她还是好心地给了我您的地址。对我来说这可是件大事，我也不愿做个忘恩负义的人，欧维。我尊重您不接受我当面道谢的意愿，但我想把您介绍给那些将永远感激您的勇气和无私行为的人。像您这样的人已经所剩无几了。感谢之意，无以言表。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was signed by the man in the gray suit and black overcoat, the one Ove hoisted off the track after he passed out. Lena had told Ove that the swooning fit had been caused by some sort of complicated brain disease. If they hadn't discovered it and started treating it when they did, it would have claimed his life within a few years. "So in a way you saved his life twice over," she'd exclaimed in that excitable tone of voice that made Ove regret a little not having left her locked up inside the garage while he still had the chance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="署名是那个穿黑色西装晕倒在火车轨道上而又被欧维救起的男人。那个女记者莱娜对欧维讲过，医生后来诊断说是某种复杂的大脑疾病造成的。若不是发现及时，那个男人很可能活不了几年。“所以你其实救了他两回。”她说这话时兴致勃勃的样子，让欧维多少有些后悔当初没趁机把她在车库里多关上一阵子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ove threw away the letter along with the advertising, tied up the bag, put it by the front door, went back into the kitchen, got out a magnet from the bottom drawer, and put up the photo on the fridge. Right next to the riotous color drawing the three-year-old had made of him on the way back from the hospital.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维把信和广告放到一起，扎进塑料袋，放到门口，回到厨房，从抽屉底部找出一块磁铁，把照片吸到冰箱上，紧挨着三岁女孩在从医院回家的路上为他画的画像。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He folded up the letter and put it back in the envelope. Held up the photo. Three children, the oldest a teenager and the others more or less the same age as Parvaneh's oldest daughter, looked back at him. Or rather, they weren't really looking, they were sort of lying about in a pile, each with a water pistol and apparently laughing until they were practically screaming. Behind them stood a blond woman of about forty-five, with a wide grin and her arms stretched out like a large bird of prey and an overflowing plastic bucket in each hand. At the bottom of the pile lay the man in the gray suit, but wearing a blue polo shirt, and trying in vain to shield himself from the downpour.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他合上信，塞回信封，把照片举到眼前。三个孩子——最年长的十来岁的样子，另外两个和帕尔瓦娜的大女儿年龄相仿——看着欧维。也算不上看着，其实是一人拿着一把刺水枪在照片背景里嬉笑着。他们身后有个四十五岁左右的金发妇女，她满脸堆笑像老鹰似的张开双臂，双手各晃动一只塑料桶。右下角是那个穿黑色西装的男人，不过这回穿着湿透了的蓝色Polo衫，正成效甚微地试图躲避倾盆大雨。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, yes, I told them one might like a bit of peace and quiet like a normal human being. But they don't listen, they don't," he moans, waving his arms tiredly towards the gravestone.</div>

<div class="line_en">Parvaneh's belly is now so big that she looks like a giant tortoise when she heaves herself down into a squatting position, one hand on the gravestone and the other hooked around Patrick's arm.

And that's speaking as someone who's already tried quite a few of them.</div>

<div class="line_en">The multifarious gathering turns around to go back to the parking area, but Parvaneh stays by the gravestone. When Ove wants to know why, she just says, "Never you bloody mind!" to him with the sort of smile that makes Ove want to throw things at her. Nothing hard, perhaps. But something symbolic.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="各式人等转身回停车场的时候，帕尔瓦娜留在墓碑旁。欧维问她想干吗，她只是回了句“你别管”，脸上的微笑让欧维想往她身上扔东西。也不扔什么硬的东西，但意思一下还是很有必要。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Girl talk," says Parvaneh succinctly when at last she comes back to the parking area and gets into the driver's seat. Ove doesn't know what she means by that, but he decides to leave it alone. Nasanin's big sister helps her with her belt, in the backseat. In the meantime Jimmy, Mirsad, and Patrick have managed to squeeze into Adrian's new car in front of them. A Toyota. Hardly an optimal choice of car for any kind of thinking person, Ove had pointed out to him many times while they stood there at the dealership. But at least it wasn't French. And Ove managed to get the price reduced by almost eight thousand kronor and made sure that the kid got winter tires thrown in for the same price. So it seemed acceptable, in spite of it all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“女生的悄悄话。”回到停车场钻进驾驶室的时候，帕尔瓦娜简短地解释道。欧维不知道她这话什么意思，但他决定随她的便。七岁女孩帮三岁女孩在后座上绑好安全带。与此同时，吉米、米尔莎德和帕特里克挤进前面阿德里安的车。一辆丰田。有脑子的人一般都不会买这车，在车行的时候，欧维反复指出。但毕竟不是法国车，欧维还把价钱砍掉了八千克朗，并且确保售价包含一套冬胎，所以不管怎么说还是可以接受的。">查看中文翻译</div>

He has the determined look of a straight-backed sentry posted somewhere in the field, in the wilderness.
