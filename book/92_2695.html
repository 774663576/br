<div class="line_en">"I have lived all my life in this quarter. The house in the Rue Morgue belongs to Madame L'Espanaye, and she and her daughter have lived there for six years. Madame sometimes came into my shop, but I didn't see the daughter very often. The two of them lived very quietly. In six years I never saw anybody go into their house except the postman and the doctor."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我一直居住在这个区。莫尔格街那所房子的主人是埃斯巴耐夫人，她和她的女儿已经在那里住了六年了。这位夫人偶尔来我的店里，可不常见她的女儿。她们俩过着非常平静的生活。六年里，除了邮递员和医生，我从未见过其他人走进她们的房子。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I was called to the house in the Rue Morgue at about three o'clock in the morning, and found twenty or thirty people at the front door. The screams from a person or people inside the house were very loud, but they stopped suddenly when we broke the front door down. I was the first up the stairs and when I reached the first floor, I could hear two angry voices, arguing loudly. One was a deep voice, the other high and shrill -- a very strange voice. The deep voice was that of a Frenchman. I'm sure it wasn't a woman s voice. I could hear the words 'diable' and 'Mon Dieu'. The shrill voice was a foreigner, perhaps a man or perhaps a woman. I couldn't hear any words, but the language was Spanish, I think."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“大概凌晨3点的时候我被叫到了莫尔格街的那所房子，已经有20到30个人聚集在房子的门前了。房子里传来一个人或是几个人很大的尖叫声，可当我们把前门撞开后尖叫声突然停止了。我是第一个上楼的人，上到二楼时，我听见了两个愤怒的声音在激烈地争吵。一个声音很低沉，另外一个声调很高，尖利刺耳——一种很奇怪的声音。那个低沉的声音是一个法国男人的。我确信那不是一个女人的声音。我听见了两个词，‘魔鬼’，还有‘天啊’。那个尖利的声音是一个外国人的，可能是男的，也可能是女的。我一个字也没听清，可我想那应该是西班牙语。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I agree with what Isodore Muset has said, except about the voices. The shrill voice was speaking in Italian -- I'm sure it wasn't French. No, I don't know Italian myself, but I'm sure it sounded like Italian words. I knew Madame L. and her daughter, and it certainly wasn't either of their voices."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我同意伊桑多尔·穆塞特说的，除了关于声音的问题。那个尖利的声音说的是意大利语——我敢肯定那不是法语。不，我不懂意大利语，可我敢肯定那听起来像是意大利语。我认识埃斯巴耐夫人和她的女儿，那声音绝不是她们其中任何一个的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

I am from Holland and don't speak French, but I'm sure the shrill voice was a man's voice -- a Frenchman. I couldn't hear the words but the voice sounded angry and afraid. The deep voice said the word 'diable' many times."</div>

Everything was silent when they got up there, and when they broke the door open, they saw nobody in the room. The two windows were closed and fastened on the inside. The police have looked through the house very carefully -- every room, every chimney, every corner -- but they have found nothing. The witnesses do not agree about the time between hearing the voices and breaking open the door -- some say it was three minutes, others say five minutes.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I was called to see the bodies at daybreak. Both of them were then lying in the room on the fourth floor. The young lady's body was bruised and cut all over when it was pushed up the chimney. The face was blue-black, the eyes were half out, and the neck was badly bruised, with deep red marks made by very strong fingers. These marks show how she died. The mother's body was also horribly bruised, and all the bones of the right leg and arm were broken. How was this done? I don't know -- perhaps by a heavy piece of wood like a table leg. A razor was used to cut the neck, and the head was no longer joined to the body. All this was done by a very strong person -- a man, and a very strong one."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“黎明时分我被叫去验尸。两具尸体当时都放在五楼的房间里。那位年轻小姐的尸体由于被塞进烟囱而青一块紫一块，伤痕累累。她脸色铁青，眼球外凸，颈部有很严重的淤青，还有强有力的手指留下的深红色指痕。从这些指痕可以看出她是如何被害的。母亲的尸体也是严重挫伤，并且右腿和右胳膊全部骨折。这是怎么回事呢？我不清楚——可能是被一根像桌腿一样沉重的木头打的。脖子是被剃刀切断的，头已经与身体分离。这都是一个非常强壮的人干的——一个男人，而且非常强壮。”">查看中文翻译</div>
