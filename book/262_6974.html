<div class="line_en">One day, when he was working with the paint, John spilt some of the waste products on his leg. He cleaned it off quickly, but it left a red, painful place on his skin, which would not go away. It kept him awake at night. He told his doctor what he had spilt on it, and the doctor looked at him strangely.</div>

<div class="line_en">John Duncan started work on Monday, and Mary Carter showed him round the factory. The most important thing that the company produced was a new paint for cars. It was a very strong, hard paint, which nothing could damage. Mary and her chemists had developed it, and they had tested it all over the world. Neither acid nor salt water could damage it, and cars came back from both the Arctic and the Sahara looking like new.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="约翰·邓肯星期一开始工作，玛丽·卡特带他参观了工厂。公司最重要的产品是一种新的汽车油漆，它是一种附着力很强的坚固油漆，任何东西都不易损坏它。玛丽和她的化学师们研制出它，并在全世界测试。它抗含酸或含盐的水，上过这种油漆的汽车从北极和撒哈拉沙漠回来如同新车一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">'Oh yes.' the doctor began to write something on a piece of paper. 'Put this on night and morning, and the pain will go in a day or two. But I'm afraid the skin there will stay red for a year or two. They're nasty chemicals, Mr Duncan, you know.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，可以。”医生开始在一张纸上写着什么。“早晚上药，疼痛一两天就会消失。但是那块皮肤上的红肿恐怕要持续一两年。它们是讨厌的化学制品，这你是知道的，邓肯先生。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'Yes, of course.' John was in a hurry. He had to meet someone important in ten minutes. 'Look, can you give me something to put on it, or not?'</div>

<div class="line_en">'Yes, I know.' John smiled at him. 'But don't worry, Doctor, we're very careful with them in the factory. No one can go near them without special safe clothing. You can come and see if you like.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，我知道。”约翰对他笑笑。“别担心，医生，我们在工厂里会非常小心地处理它们。不穿特别安全服，任何人也不能靠近它们。如果你愿意，可以来看看。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">'Good,' said the doctor. 'I wouldn't want anyone to drink those waste products, that's all.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这就好，我只不过不想让任何人喝带有废料的水，”医生说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'They won't, doctor,' said John. 'All the drinking water comes out of the river five kilometres upstream, you know that. Who's going to drink salt water from the river mouth, for heaven's sake? Chemists from London have checked it, too, you know, and our company lawyers know all about it. So it's not dangerous and we're not doing anything wrong. Don't worry about it.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他们不会的，医生，”约翰说，“所有饮用水来自5公里以外的上游，这你是知道的。天啊，谁又会去喝河口处的咸水？伦敦的化学家们也检测过水质，你知道，我们公司的律师知道这一切。所以这并不危险，我们也没做什么错事，你不用为此担心。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'Well, yes, of course,'said John.' But it's all right, you know,'he added quickly. 'It's very carefully checked, all the time. It's a big river, and we only produce a few hundred litres of the waste products a day. And we're only two kilo-metres from the sea, after all.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那当然，”约翰说。“但没关系，你知道，”他很快接着说，“废料随时都经过认真检验。河大得很，而我们每天只生产出几百公升废料。再说，我们毕竟离大海只有两公里。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was a very busy man now. All day he had to test differ-ent types of paints, and make sure they were safe. He was also busy buying a big, comfortable house for his family, with a large field beside it, where Christine could keep a horse. The house was half a kilometre from the sea, and its gardens went down to the river. There was an empty boathouse there.</div>
