<div class="line_en">The chateau into which my valet had ventured to make forcible entrance, rather than permit me, in my desperately wounded condition, to pass a night in the open air, was one of those piles of commingled gloom and grandeur which have so long frowned among the Appenines, not less in fact than in the fancy of Mrs. Radcliffe. To all appearance it had been temporarily and very lately abandoned. We established ourselves in one of the smallest and least sumptuously furnished apartments. It lay in a remote turret of the building. Its decorations were rich, yet tattered and antique. Its walls were hung with tapestry and bedecked with manifold and multiform armorial trophies, together with an unusually great number of very spirited modern paintings in frames of rich golden arabesque. In these paintings, which depended from the walls not only in their main surfaces, but in very many nooks which the bizarre architecture of the chateau rendered necessary -- in these paintings my incipient delirium, perhaps, had caused me to take deep interest; so that I bade Pedro to close the heavy shutters of the room -- since it was already night -- to light the tongues of a tall candelabrum which stood by the head of my bed -- and to throw open far and wide the fringed curtains of black velvet which enveloped the bed itself. I wished all this done that I might resign myself, if not to sleep, at least alternately to the contemplation of these pictures, and the perusal of a small volume which had been found upon the pillow, and which purported to criticise and describe them.</div>

<div class="line_en">But the action produced an effect altogether unanticipated. The rays of the numerous candles (for there were many) now fell within a niche of the room which had hitherto been thrown into deep shade by one of the bed-posts. I thus saw in vivid light a picture all unnoticed before. It was the portrait of a young girl just ripening into womanhood. I glanced at the painting hurriedly, and then closed my eyes. Why I did this was not at first apparent even to my own perception. But while my lids remained thus shut, I ran over in my mind my reason for so shutting them. It was an impulsive movement to gain time for thought -- to make sure that my vision had not deceived me -- to calm and subdue my fancy for a more sober and more certain gaze. In a very few moments I again looked fixedly at the painting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但这一举动却产生了意想不到的效果。好多枝蜡烛的光线照到了一个壁龛上——刚才，它是被一根床柱沉沉的阴影遮挡住了。明亮的烛光下，我看到了一幅先前根本没注意到的画——是一个年轻女子的画像，她有着刚成熟的女人的风韵。我只对那幅肖像投去匆匆的一瞥，就赶紧闭上了眼睛。起初，我不理解自己为什么会有这样的反应。不过在我的眼睑还没打开的时候，我就明白自己为何要闭上双眼了。那不过是一种冲动，为的是能有时间思考——以确定眼中所见并非幻觉，以平息我的想像力，从而可以看得更冷静、更可靠。只是过了一会儿，我就睁开了眼睛，目光牢牢盯在那幅画上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Long -- long I read -- and devoutly, devotedly I gazed. Rapidly and gloriously the hours flew by, and the deep midnight came. The position of the candelabrum displeased me, and outreaching my hand with difficulty, rather than disturb my slumbering valet, I placed it so as to throw its rays more fully upon the book.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我虔诚地捧读着那本小书，久久不忍释手。时间在我的沉醉中飞快流逝，转眼间已是午夜。烛台摆放的位置使我很不如意，我不愿打扰酣睡的随从，就自己费力地伸手挪动了一下，以便让光线更好地照在书本上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That I now saw aright I could not and would not doubt; for the first flashing of the candles upon that canvas had seemed to dissipate the dreamy stupor which was stealing over my senses, and to startle me at once into waking life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这下子我是看清楚了。我不能也不会否则这一点。烛光一照到画布上，那悄然弥漫在意识中的梦一般的恍惚，似乎就被驱散了。我马上就惊醒了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The portrait, I have already said, was that of a young girl. It was a mere head and shoulders, done in what is technically termed a vignette manner; much in the style of the favorite heads of Sully. The arms, the bosom and even the ends of the radiant hair, melted imperceptibly into the vague yet deep shadow which formed the back-ground of the whole. The frame was oval, richly gilded and filagreed in Moresque. As a thing of art nothing could be more admirable than the painting itself. But it could have been neither the execution of the work, nor the immortal beauty of the countenance, which had so suddenly and so vehemently moved me. Least of all, could it have been that my fancy, shaken from its half slumber, had mistaken the head for that of a living person. I saw at once that the peculiarities of the design, of the vignetting, and of the frame, must have instantly dispelled such idea -- must have prevented even its momentary entertainment. Thinking earnestly upon these points, I remained, for an hour perhaps, half sitting, half reclining, with my vision riveted upon the portrait. At length, satisfied with the true secret of its effect, I fell back within the bed. I had found the spell of the picture in an absolute life-likeliness of expression, which, at first startling, finally confounded, subdued and appalled me. With deep and reverent awe I replaced the candelabrum in its former position. The cause of my deep agitation being thus shut from view, I sought eagerly the volume which discussed the paintings and their histories. Turning to the number which designated the oval portrait, I there read the vague and quaint words which follow:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我说过了，那是一个年轻的姑娘的肖像。画面上只有头部和肩膀，用的是所谓的“虚光画”技法，颇有萨利擅长的头像画之风。画中人的双臂、胸部乃至闪闪发光的头发末梢，都不易察觉地虚化成朦胧幽深的阴影，作为整幅画的背景。画框是椭圆形的，厚厚得镀上一层金，装饰上取的是摩尔式风格。不过作为一件艺术品，最令人钦佩的，还是肖像本身。刚才骤然而强烈打动我的，不可能是画作的技法，也不可能是画中人不朽的美貌，而最不可能的，当数我那已从半浑噩状态中清醒的想像力——我居然把画上的头像当作了活生生的姑娘。可我马上就明白了，画作的构图、虚光、画框方面的特点，必定在瞬息间就驱散了我的这种看法，不容许我再生出半点这样的想法。我陷入了沉思。或许有整整一个小时，我都半坐半倚在床头，凝视着那幅肖像。最后，弄清那种神奇效果的真正秘密后，我才满意地钻进被窝。我发现画面的魔力所在——画中人的表情绝对栩栩如生。那魔力一开始让我震惊，接着是困惑，被征服，最后则是骇然。因为心中有了深深的敬畏，我把烛台挪到了原来的位置。那令我激荡的画作，被隔在视野之外了。我急切地找出那本评述绘画及其渊源的小册子，翻到介绍椭圆形画像的那一页。我读到了下面这段含糊而离奇的文字：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"She was a maiden of rarest beauty, and not more lovely than full of glee. And evil was the hour when she saw, and loved, and wedded the painter. He, passionate, studious, austere, and having already a bride in his Art: she a maiden of rarest beauty, and not more lovely than full of glee: all light and smiles, and frolicksome as the young fawn: loving and cherishing all things: hating only the Art which was her rival: dreading only the pallet and brushes and other untoward instruments which deprived her of the countenance of her lover. It was thus a terrible thing for this lady to hear the painter speak of his desire to pourtray even his young bride. But she was humble and obedient, and sat meekly for many weeks in the dark high turret-chamber where the light dripped upon the pale canvas only from overhead. But he, the painter, took glory in his work, which went on from hour to hour and from day to day. And he was a passionate, and wild and moody man, who became lost in reveries; so that he would not see that the light which fell so ghastlily in that lone turret withered the health and the spirits of his bride, who pined visibly to all but him. Yet she smiled on and still on, uncomplainingly, because she saw that the painter, (who had high renown,) took a fervid and burning pleasure in his task, and wrought day and night to depict her who so loved him, yet who grew daily more dispirited and weak. And in sooth some who beheld the portrait spoke of its resemblance in low words, as of a mighty marvel, and a proof not less of the power of the painter than of his deep love for her whom he depicted so surpassingly well. But at length, as the labor drew nearer to its conclusion, there were admitted none into the turret; for the painter had grown wild with the ardor of his work, and turned his eyes from the canvas rarely, even to regard the countenance of his wife. And he would not see that the tints which he spread upon the canvas were drawn from the cheeks of her who sat beside him. And when many weeks had passed, and but little remained to do, save one brush upon the mouth and one tint upon the eye, the spirit of the lady again flickered up as the flame within the socket of the lamp. And then the brush was given, and then the tint was placed; and, for one moment, the painter stood entranced before the work which he had wrought; but in the next, while he yet gazed, he grew tremulous and very pallid, and aghast, and crying with a loud voice 'This is indeed Life itself!' turned suddenly to regard his beloved: -- She was dead."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她是一位美得罕见的姑娘，她欢快活泼，可爱得无与伦比。当他与画家一见钟情并成为他的新娘，不幸的时刻降临了。他充满激情、工作勤勉、不苟言笑，而且，他已经把艺术当作新娘了。她，一个美得罕见的姑娘，欢快活泼，可爱得无与伦比；她光彩夺目，笑意盈盈，嬉戏时就像只小鹿；她满怀爱心，珍惜世上的一切。但她憎恨艺术，因为艺术是她的情敌；她害怕调色板、画笔和其他画具，因为它们夺去了爱人的笑脸。因而，听画家说想给年轻的新娘画像时，姑娘认为对她来说，那真是件可怕的事情。可她柔婉乖顺，终于还是温驯地在塔楼里坐了几个星期。塔楼的房间又暗又高，只有从头顶射到洒到灰色画布上的一星亮光。可是他，那位画家，却认为自己的工作无比荣光，他干了一个小时又一个小时，干了一天又一天。他是一个浑身激情、狂放不羁、喜怒无常的人，加上又沉湎于自己的幻想之中，所以他没看出，孤零零的塔楼上那缕惨淡的光线把新娘照得枯萎了。她的身心都遭到了毁损。谁都看得出她的憔悴，惟独他没注意到。然而她还微微笑着，静静坐着，一句怨言也没有。因为她看到画家（他名气很大）从工作中获得了莫大的乐趣，他热情似火地画着深爱他的女子，不舍昼夜。可女子却日益萎靡、日益虚弱了。看到肖像的人无不低声说画得很传神、好得出奇，说这真是个非凡的奇迹，不仅证明了画家功力深厚，也见证了画家对画中人的深切爱恋。但当这幅画即将完成时，便不许任何人再上塔楼，因为画家的热情已经几近癫狂，他很少从画布上抬起眼睛，对妻子的面容当然是漠不关心。他不会看出，那涂抹在画布上的色彩，就来自坐在身边的妻子的脸庞。几个星期已过去了，惟有唇上差一笔没画、眼睛的色彩差一层没涂。女子的重又变得神采奕奕，如同火苗在烛孔里的最后一闪。于是，唇上的最后一笔画上了，眼睛上的色彩也抹上了。画家痴迷地站在自己的作品前站了一会儿，接着，就在他还在凝视画面时，他开始浑身发抖，脸色苍白，目瞪口呆。然后，他大声惊呼道：“这就是生命！”可当他蓦然转眼看他心爱的妻子时，她已经死了！">查看中文翻译</div>
