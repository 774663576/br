<div class="line_en">If it were true that Catherine was in love, she was certainly very quiet about it. She had told Morris Townsend that she would not mention him to her father, and so she said nothing about Morris's continued visits. It was only polite, of course, for Morris to visit after the dinner at Washington Square, and only natural for him to continue visiting.</div>

<div class="line_en">These visits had quickly become the most important thing in Catherine's life. She was very happy.

<div class="line_en">The family in Washington Square spent every Sunday evening at Mrs Almond's house. On the Sunday after his conversation with Mrs Penniman, Doctor Sloper went off to another room to talk to his brother-in-law about business. He came back later to find that Morris Townsend had arrived, and was sitting on a sofa beside Catherine. There were several friends of the family present. and it was easy for the two young people to sit and talk privately. The Doctor saw at once, however, that his daughter was pain fully conscious that he was watching her. She sat very still, with her eyes down, blushing deeply.</div>

<div class="line_en">The question seemed to have a double meaning, and the Doctor looked at him for a moment before he answered. "No young man should ever give up hope. If he does not succeed in one thing, he can try another."</div>
