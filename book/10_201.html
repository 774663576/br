<div class="line_en">The next morning Bilbo woke up with the early sun in his eyes. He jumped up to look at the time and to go and put his kettle on-and found he was not home at all. So he sat down and wished in vain for a wash and a brush. He did not get either, nor tea nor toast nor bacon for his breakfast, only cold mutton and rabbit. And after that he had to get ready for a fresh start.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天，比尔博醒来时，眼前就是一片清晨的阳光。他一跃而起，准备看看时钟，然后去把水壶烧上——却发现自己根本不是在自己家里。所以，他只能沮丧地坐下来，心想，看来洗脸和刷牙是别指望了。他果然两样都没得到，也没有热茶加吐司加火腿的早餐，只有冷羊肉和兔肉。吃完这些之后，他就得要为重新出发作准备了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This time he was allowed to climb on to an eagle's back and cling between his wings. The air rushed over him and he shut his eyes. The dwarves were crying farewells and promising to repay the Lord of the Eagles if ever they could, as off rose fifteen great birds from the mountain's side. The sun was still close to the eastern edge of things. The morning was cool, and mists were in the valleys and hollows and twined here and there about the peaks and pinnacles of the hills. Bilbo opened an eye to peep and saw that the birds were already high up and the world was far away, and the mountains were falling back behind them into the distance. He shut his eyes again and held on tighter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这次，他获准爬到一只大鹰的背上，紧紧抓住两翼之间的羽毛。冷风飕飕地从他身上掠过，他紧紧地闭上了双眼。当十五只大鹰从山崖边起飞的时候，矮人们大声喊着再见，承诺说只要有机会就一定要回报鹰王。太阳依旧处于正东的方向，早晨空气清凉，雾气集聚在山谷中，东一片西一片地缠绕着山峰。比尔博睁开一只眼偷偷望了望，发现大鸟们已经飞得十分高，大地已经变得十分遥远了，群山退向他们的身后，渐行渐远。他闭上眼睛，双手抓得更紧了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After a good while the eagles must have seen the point they were making for, even from their great height, for they began to go down circling round in great spirals. They did this for a long while, and at last the hobbit opened his eyes again. The earth was much nearer, and below them were trees that looked like oaks and elms, and wide grass lands, and a river running through it all. But cropping out of the ground, right in the path of the stream which looped itself about it, was a great rock, almost a hill of stone, like a last outpost of the distant mountains, or a huge piece cast miles into the plain by some giant among giants.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过了好一阵之后，大鹰们一定是看见了他们的目的地，尽管他们飞得很高很高，因为他们开始画着很大的圈子缓缓地盘旋下降。他们盘旋了很久，最后霍比特人终于又睁开了眼睛。地面已经更靠近了，底下有树，看着像是橡树和榆树，还有宽阔的草地，以及一条穿越其间的河流。不过，在地面上矗立一块巨岩，大得几乎像是一座小山，溪流似乎在它身边绕了个圈。它仿佛是远方山脉的最后一个哨卡，又像是被巨人中的巨人从大山里丢出来的一块大石。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Don't pinch!" said his eagle. "You need not be frightened like a rabbit, even if you look rather like one. It is a fair morning with little wind. What is finer than flying?"</div>

<div class="line_en">And so they parted. And though the Lord of the Eagles became in after days the King of All Birds and wore a golden crown, and his fifteen chieftains golden collars (made of the gold that the dwarves gave them), Bilbo never saw them again-except high and far off in the battle of Five Armies. But as that comes in at the end of this tale we will say no more about it just now.</div>

<div class="line_en">The dwarves groaned and looked most distressed, and Bilbo wept. They had begun to think Gandalf was going to come all the way and would always be there to help them out of difficulties. "I am not going to disappear this very instant," said he. "I can give you a day or two more. Probably I can help you out of your present plight, and I need a little help myself. We have no food, and no baggage, and no ponies to ride; and you don't know where you are. Now I can tell you that. You are still some miles north of the path which we should have been following, if we had not left the mountain pass in a hurry. Very few people live in these parts, unless they have come here since I was last down this way, which is some years ago. But there is somebody that I know of, who lives not far away. That Somebody made the steps on the great rock-the Carrock I believe he calls it. He does not come here often, certainly not in the daytime, and it is no good waiting for him. In fact it would be very dangerous. We must go and find him; and if all goes well at our meeting, I think I shall be off and wish you like the eagles 'farewell wherever you fare!'"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="矮人们发出不情愿的声音，脸上露出很受打击的表情，比尔博甚至哭了起来。大家起初都以为甘道夫会全程陪同他们一起冒险，总是会帮助他们脱离困境。“我也不是说走就走，”他说，“我会再给你们一两天，或许我可以协助你们脱离眼前的困境，我自己也需要一些帮助。我们没有食物，没有行李，也没有小马可骑，你们也不知道身在何处。不过，关于这点我可以告诉你们。你们现在位于我们该走的道路以北，距离有几哩远。如果我们离开大山不是那么仓促的话，本来是可以正好踏上那条路的。这一带没有什么人居住，除非在我几年前离开之后有人新迁移到这里来了。不过这儿倒是有我认识的人，就住在不远的地方，正是此人在巨岩上兴建了石阶，我记得他把这块巨岩叫作卡尔岩。他不常到这儿来，至少不会在白天来，所以在这边等他来也没什么用。事实上，这样做反而会很危险，我们得主动去找他，如果一切顺利我们能碰上头的话，我想到时我就可以离开了，并且像大鹰一样祝你们‘无论到哪儿都一切顺利！’”">查看中文翻译</div>

Indeed we are now a good deal further east than I ever meant to come with you, for after all this is not my adventure. I may look in on it again before it is all over, but in the meanwhile I have some other pressing business to attend to."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我一直想着，只要可能，就一定要带你们安全地越过山脉。”巫师说，“现在，凭着得当的指挥和不错的运气，我做到了。现在，我们其实已经到了比我当初计划送你们前往的地方还要往东许多的地点了。在你们的冒险结束之前，我或许还会再来看看你们，不过现在，我有其他紧急的事情要去办。”">查看中文翻译</div>

When they had dried in the sun, which was now strong and warm, they were refreshed, if still sore and a little hungry. Soon they crossed the ford (carrying the hobbit), and then began to march through the long green grass and down the lines of the wide-armed oaks and the tall elms.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="矮人们听见巫师这样对比尔博说话，全都围拢了过来。“刚刚说的就是你要带我们去见的人吗？”他们问道，“你难道不能找个脾气更好的人吗？你可不可以再解释得更清楚一点？”——全是诸如此类的问题。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes it certainly is! No I could not! And I was explaining very carefully," answered the wizard crossly. "If you must know more, his name is Beorn. He is very strong, and he is a skin-changer."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，说的就是他！不，我不能！我就是在非常小心地解释这一切。”巫师一口气就同时回答了三个问题。“如果你们坚持想知道得更多，我可以告诉你们，他的名字叫贝奥恩，他非常强壮，而且是个换皮人。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Good gracious heavens, no, no, NO, NO!" said Gandalf. "Don't be a fool Mr. Baggins if you can help it; and in the name of all wonder don't mention the word furrier again as long as you are within a hundred miles of his house, nor rug, cape, tippet, muff, nor any other such unfortunate word! He is a skin-changer. He changes his skin: sometimes he is a huge black bear, sometimes he is a great strong black-haired man with huge arms and a great beard. I cannot tell you much more, though that ought to be enough. Some say that he is a bear descended from the great and ancient bears of the mountains that lived there before the giants came. Others say that he is a man descended from the first men who lived before Smaug or the other dragons came into this part of the world, and before the goblins came into the hills out of the North. I cannot say, though I fancy the last is the true tale. He is not the sort of person to ask questions of.</div>

It grew very hot. Sometimes they rested under the trees, and then Bilbo felt so hungry that he would have eaten acorns, if any had been ripe enough yet to have fallen to the ground.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="比尔博和矮人们现在有许多东西要思考，所以他们没有再问更多的问题。在他们前面还有一段漫漫长路要走。他们时而艰难地爬上斜坡，时而又迈着沉重的步伐走进山谷。天气变得非常热，有时他们会在树下休息，这时比尔博就会感到饥饿难当，如果有什么橡树子熟透了落到地上，他一定会毫不客气地给吃下去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"At any rate he is under no enchantment but his own. He lives in an oak-wood and has a great wooden house; and as a man he keeps cattle and horses which are nearly as marvellous as himself. They work for him and talk to him. He does not eat them; neither does he hunt or eat wild animals. He keeps hives and hives of great fierce bees, and lives most on cream and honey. As a bear he ranges far and wide. I once saw him sitting all alone on the top of the Carrock at night watching the moon sinking towards the Misty Mountains, and I heard him growl in the tongue of bears: 'The day will come when they will perish and I shall go back!' That is why I believe he once came from the mountains himself."</div>

<div class="line_en">Inside the hall it was now quite dark. Beorn clapped his hands, and in trotted four beautiful white ponies and several large long-bodied grey dogs. Beorn said something to them in a queer language like animal noises turned into talk. They went out again and soon came back carrying torches in their mouths, which they lit at the fire and stuck in low brackets on the pillars of the hall about the central hearth. The dogs could stand on their hind-legs when they wished, and carry things with their fore-feet. Quickly they got out boards and trestles from the side walls and set them up near the fire.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then baa-baa-baa! was heard, and in came some snow-white sheep led by a large coal-black ram. One bore a white cloth embroidered at the edges with figures of animals; others bore on their broad backs trays with bowls and platters and knives and wooden spoons, which the dogs took and quickly laid on the trestle-tables. These were very low, low enough even for Bilbo to sit at comfortably. Beside them a pony pushed two low-seated benches with wide rush-bottoms and little short thick legs for Gandalf and Thorin, while at the far end he put Beorn's big black chair of the same sort (in which he sat with his great legs stuck far out under the table). These were all the chairs he had in his hall, and he probably had them low like the tables for the convenience of the wonderful animals that waited on him. What did the rest sit on? They were not forgotten. The other ponies came in rolling round drum-shaped sections of logs, smoothed and polished, and low enough even for Bilbo; so soon they were all seated at Beorn's table, and the hall had not seen such a gathering for many a year.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，他们听见了“咩——咩——咩！”的声音，一只炭黑色的大个儿公羊领着几只雪白的绵羊走了进来。一只背着边缘绣有动物图案的白布，另几只则在宽阔的背上扛着托盘、碗、浅盘、餐刀和木制的汤匙。大狗们拿下这些东西，立刻将它们摆放在刚搭好的小桌板上。这些桌板都十分低矮，连比尔博坐下吃饭都觉得很舒服。在他们旁边，一匹小马将两条低矮的长凳推了过来，长凳凳面宽阔，発脚粗短，是专门给甘道夫和梭林坐的。在他们对面的主位上则放上了贝奥恩那把样式类似的大黑椅（他坐上去的时候，必须把两条大长腿远远地伸到桌子底下去）。这些是他收在大厅内的全部椅子了，他刻意将这些椅子跟桌子一样弄矮，多半是为了方便服侍他的聪明的动物。那其他人坐哪里呢？他们并没有被忘记。其他的小马滚着圆鼓形的木桩走了进来，这些木桩都经过特别的打磨和抛光，比尔博也可以舒舒服服地坐在上面。于是没多久，众人就在贝奥恩的桌旁坐了下来，这座大厅已经很多年没有见识过这么人头济济的场面了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The dwarves listened and shook their beards, for they knew that they must soon venture into that forest and that after the mountains it was the worst of the perils they had to pass before they came to the dragon's stronghold. When dinner was over they began to tell tales of their own, but Beorn seemed to be growing drowsy and paid little heed to them. They spoke most of gold and silver and jewels and the making of things by smith-craft, and Beorn did not appear to care for such things: there were no things of gold or silver in his hall, and few save the knives were made of metal at all.</div>

The light of the torches and the fire flickered about them, and on the table were two tall red beeswax candles. All the time they ate, Beorn in his deep rolling voice told tales of the wild lands on this side of the mountains, and especially of the dark and dangerous wood, that lay outstretched far to North and South a day's ride before them, barring their way to the East, the terrible forest of Mirkwood.</div>

<div class="line_en">Bilbo found that beds had already been laid at the side of the hall, on a sort of raised platform between the pillars and the outer wall. For him there was a little mattress of straw and woollen blankets. He snuggled into them very gladly, summertime though it was. The fire burned low and he fell asleep. Yet in the night he woke: the fire had now sunk to a few embers; the dwarves and Gandalf were all asleep, to judge by their breathing; a splash of white on the floor came from the high moon, which was peering down through the smoke-hole in the roof.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="比尔博这才发现大厅的边沿已经铺好了床，在柱子和外墙之间突起的平台上。有一张小小的草垫席子和几条羊毛毯是专门给他准备的，他非常高兴地钻进其中，尽管现在还是夏天。火苗渐渐小了下去，他进入了梦乡。然而到了半夜的时候他醒了过来：火焰现在只剩下几点余烬，从呼吸声来判断，甘道夫和矮人都已经睡着了，地上洒满了银白的月光，高挂中天的月亮正从屋顶上的烟洞往屋里窥探着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was full morning when he awoke. One of the dwarves had fallen over him in the shadows where he lay, and had rolled down with a bump from the platform on to the floor. It was Bofur, and he was grumbling about it, when Bilbo opened his eyes.</div>

"I will answer the second question first," he said, " -- but bless me! this is a splendid place for smoke rings!" Indeed for a long time they could get nothing more out of him, he was so busy sending smoke rings dodging round the pillars of the hall, changing them into all sorts of different shapes and colours, and setting them at last chasing one another out of the hole in the roof. They must have looked very queer from outside, popping out into the air one after another, green, blue, red, silver-grey, yellow, white; big ones, little ones; little ones dodging through big ones and joining into figure-eights, and going off like a flock of birds into the distance.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I have been picking out bear-tracks," he said at last. "There must have been a regular bears' meeting outside here last night. I soon saw that Beorn could not have made them all: there were far too many of them, and they were of various sizes too. I should say there were little bears, large bears, ordinary bears, and gigantic big bears, all dancing outside from dark to nearly dawn. They came from almost every direction, except from the west over the river, from the Mountains. In that direction only one set of footprints led-none coming, only ones going away from here. I followed these as far as the Carrock. There they disappeared into the river, but the water was too deep and strong beyond the rock for me to cross. It is easy enough, as you remember, to get from this bank to the Carrock by the ford, but on the other side is a cliff standing up from a swirling channel. I had to walk miles before I found a place where the river was wide and shallow enough for me to wade and swim, and then miles back again to pick up the tracks again. By that time it was too late for me to follow them far. They went straight off in the direction of the pine-woods on the east side of the Misty Mountains, where we had our pleasant little party with the Wargs the night before last. And now I think I have answered your first question, too," ended Gandalf, and he sat a long while silent.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我一直在追踪熊的足迹。”他终于开口说话了，“昨天晚上，这里外面一定有一个大熊的常规聚会。我很快就知道，贝奥恩不可能同时化身成那么多只熊，因为它们的数量太多了，身材大小也各不相同。我应该这么说，那里有小熊，有大熊，有普通的熊，有超级巨大的熊，都从半夜跳舞跳到快天亮。他们几乎是从四面八方赶过来的，惟一的例外是河对岸的西方，也就是迷雾山脉的方向。在那个方向，只有一道离开的足迹，而不是过来。我跟踪那路足迹一直来到卡尔岩。足迹从那之后就消失在了河中。不过巨岩后面的水流太过湍急，我没有办法过河。你们应该还记得从渡口过到卡尔岩其实不算太困难，但在另外一边则是一道矗立在水流湍急的峡谷之上的悬崖。我走了好几哩的路，才找到一个河水又宽又浅可以渡过的地方，然后我还得再走好几哩路回来才能够继续跟踪足迹。那时，天色已晚，我再也不能继续追踪下去了。那路脚印直直通往迷雾山脉东边的松树林中，也就是我们前天晚上和座狼经历过小小聚会的地方。现在，我想我也同时回答了你们的第一个问题。”甘道夫说完了，他坐着，很长一段时间都没有再说话。">查看中文翻译</div>

He had been over the river and right back up into the mountains-from which you can guess that he could travel quickly, in bear's shape at any rate. From the burnt wolf-glade he had soon found out that part of their story was true; but he had found more than that: he had caught a Warg and a goblin wandering in the woods. From these he had got news: the goblin patrols were still hunting with Wargs for the dwarves, and they were fiercely angry because of the death of the Great Goblin, and also because of the burning of the chief wolf's nose and the death from the wizard's fire of many of his chief servants. So much they told him when he forced them, but he guessed there was more wickedness than this afoot, and that a great raid of the whole goblin army with their wolf-allies into the lands shadowed by the mountains might soon be made to find the dwarves, or to take vengeance on the men and creatures that lived there, and who they thought must be sheltering them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因此，他们和他一起吃起了早餐。贝奥恩一改以往的冷淡，心情似乎变得大好，他说了许多有趣的故事，让所有的人都和他一起哈哈大笑。大家也没有花多少时间，就明白了他究竟去了哪儿，以及为什么他对大家这么友善起来，因为他自己亲口道出了真相。在他失踪期间，他渡过了河，到山里面跑了一趟——从中你可以想见，至少当他变身为熊的形体出没时，他可以用多么快的速度奔跑。从那片烧焦的狼群聚集过的林中空地，他很快就确认他们故事中的那部分是真实的，但是，他还发现了更多的真相。他在森林中抓到了一匹座狼和一个半兽人在四处游荡，从这两个家伙的口中他得到消息：半兽人的巡逻队依旧和座狼一起在追捕着这些矮人，由于半兽人首领的死亡，也由于巫师的火焰令座狼首领鼻子烧伤，令它的许多得力部下死亡，他们的怒气难以平息。当他拷问这两个家伙的时候，他们只说出了这些，不过，他认为背后肯定会有更多的邪恶勾当。不久以后，全体半兽人大军可能会和他们的盟友座狼全体出动，对大山周边的地区进行扫荡，搜捕矮人，对居住在这一地区的人类和动物，以及他们认为在庇护着矮人们的人展开疯狂的报复。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It was a good story, that of yours," said Beorn, "but I like it still better now I am sure it is true. You must forgive my not taking your word.

As it is, I can only say that I have hurried home as fast as I could to see that you were safe, and to offer you any help that I can. I shall think more kindly of dwarves after this.

<div class="line_en">This is what he promised to do for them. He would provide ponies for each of them, and a horse for Gandalf, for their journey to the forest, and he would lade them with food to last them for weeks with care, and packed so as to be as easy as possible to carry-nuts, flour, sealed jars of dried fruits, and red earthenware pots of honey, and twice-baked cakes that would keep good a long time, and on a little of which they could march far. The making of these was one of his secrets; but honey was in them, as in most of his foods, and they were good to eat, though they made one thirsty. Water, he said, they would not need to carry this side of the forest, for there were streams and springs along the road. "But your way through Mirkwood is dark, dangerous and difficult," he said. "Water is not easy to find there, nor food. The time is not yet come for nuts (though it may be past and gone indeed before you get to the other side), and nuts are about all that grows there fit for food; in there the wild things are dark, queer, and savage. I will provide you with skins for carrying water, and I will give you some bows and arrows. But I doubt very much whether anything you find in Mirkwood will be wholesome to eat or to drink. There is one stream there, I know, black and strong which crosses the path. That you should neither drink of, nor bathe in; for I have heard that it carries enchantment and a great drowsiness and forgetfulness. And in the dim shadows of that place I don't think you will shoot anything, wholesome or unwholesome, without straying from the path. That you MUST NOT do, for any reason.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="贝奥恩答应要给他们如下帮助：他会给每人一四小马，甘道夫则是一匹成年骏马，供他们踏上前往森林的路途，还会帮他们装满充足的食物，如果小心安排的话，这些食物够他们吃上好几个星期的。这些食物经过特殊的包装，携带起来十分的方便——有坚果、面粉、装在密封罐子里的干果、红色陶罐装的蜂蜜，还有经过两次烘烤的蛋糕，它们可以保存很长时间，而且只要吃一小口，就可以走很远的路。这些蛋糕的制作是他的秘密之一，但就和他制作的大多数食品一样，里面都包含蜂蜜，虽然吃了会感觉有点口渴，但味道却是非常好。根据他的说法，在森林的这一边他们不需要携带饮用水，因为一路上都有小溪和泉水。“但是，穿越黑森林的道路黑暗、危险而又困难，”他说，“在那里，食物和饮水都很不好找。坚果成熟的季节还没到来（不过，等他们走到另一边的时候，季节可能又已经过了），而生长在那里的所有东西中，又只有坚果适合拿来当食物。在那座森林里，野生的动物都是黑暗、诡异而又凶猛的。我会提供你们可以携带饮水的皮囊，以及一些弓箭。不过，我很怀疑你们在黑森林里找到的东西能够安全地吃喝。我知道森林中有一条河流，强劲的黑水拦在你们的路上。那河里的水你们绝对不可以喝，也不可以在里面洗澡，因为，我听说河水带有强大的魔法，会让人昏昏欲睡，并且渐渐忘记一切。在黑森林的暗影中，我认为如果你们想要射到一些东西，不管能吃还是不能吃，都有可能会偏离你们的前进路线。所以，无论出于任何理由，绝对不要去打猎。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As soon as they left his high hedges at the east of his fenced lands they turned north and then bore to the north-west. By his advice they were no longer making for the main forest-road to the south of his land. Had they followed the pass, their path would have led them down a stream from the mountains that joined the great river miles south of the Carrock. At that point there was a deep ford which they might have passed, if they had still had their ponies, and beyond that a track led to the skirts of the wood and to the entrance of the old forest road. But Beorn had warned them that that way was now often used by the goblins, while the forest-road itself, he had heard, was overgrown and disused at the eastern end and led to impassable marshes where the paths had long been lost. Its eastern opening had also always been far to the south of the Lonely Mountain, and would have left them still with a long and difficult northward march when they got to the other side. North of the Carrock the edge of Mirkwood drew closer to the borders of the Great River, and though here the Mountains too drew down nearer, Beorn advised them to take this way; for at a place a few days' ride due north of the Carrock was the gate of a little-known pathway through Mirkwood that led almost straight towards the Lonely Mountain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们从东面离开了贝奥恩那用高高的篱笆围起来的领地，出来之后立刻转向北方，然后就朝着西北方向前进。根据他的建议，他们不再按原先打算的那样，从贝奥恩领地的南面踏上通往森林的大道，因为如果走那条路的话，最后将必须渡过从山脉中流下的一条小河，这条小河会在卡尔岩以南几哩的地方汇入大河。在两条河流的交汇点，会有一片河水相对较深的河滩，如果他们还有小马的话，或许可以渡过。过了河之后，会有一条路通往森林的边缘，来到老林路的入口。但贝奥恩警告他们，半兽人现在经常会踏上这条道路。而且他也听说，老林路本身的东端已经因长久弃置不用而为树木所覆盖，硬走下去的话，便会来到无路可走也无法穿越的沼泽地。再说，就算他们勉强走到了森林的另一边，黑森林东端的出口也一直是离孤山南方距离最远的一个，他们还必须往北经历一段十分漫长而又艰辛的路程，才能够到达孤山。卡尔岩北边的黑森林边缘更靠近大河，虽然这里离迷雾山脉也更近些，但贝奥恩建议他们不妨走这条路，因为从这边往北骑几天，就会来到黑森林一条鲜为人知的道路入口，那条道路穿越森林，几乎直直地通向孤山。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That is why they were now riding in silence, galloping wherever the ground was grassy and smooth, with the mountains dark on their left, and in the distance the line of the river with its trees drawing ever closer. The sun had only just turned west when they started, and till evening it lay golden on the land about them. It was difficult to think of pursuing goblins behind, and when they had put many miles between them and Beorn's house they began to talk and to sing again and to forget the dark forest-path that lay in front. But in the evening when the dusk came on and the peaks of the mountains glowered against the sunset they made a camp and set a guard, and most of them slept uneasily with dreams in which there came the howl of hunting wolves and the cries of goblins.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正因为如此，他们这会儿才在不出声地策马疾行。只要地面上有了草，道路变得平坦，他们就会纵马飞奔。黑黢黢的大山矗立在他们的左侧，远处，细细的一线河流挟带着两岸的树木正在不断逼近。他们出发的时候，太阳才刚刚往西方移去，到晚上之前太阳都将在他们身边的土地上洒下万道金光。此情此景实在让人很难想像身后会有半兽人的追兵。当他们离开贝奥恩的居所许多哩之后，大伙儿又开始有说有笑起来，并且有点忘记了前面还有森林中黑暗的道路在等着他们。但等到夜幕降临，大山的座座山峰在落日的映衬下露出狰狞的面目时，他们扎下营来，并且安排了轮班守夜。即便如此，大多数人还是睡得很不踏实，梦中出现了座狼的狂嗥与半兽人的怪叫。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The goblins," Beorn had said, "will not dare to cross the Great River for a hundred miles north of the Carrock nor to come near my house-it is well protected at night! -- but I should ride fast; for if they make their raid soon they will cross the river to the south and scour all the edge of the forest so as to cut you off, and Wargs run swifter than ponies. Still you are safer going north, even though you seem to be going back nearer to their strongholds; for that is what they will least expect, and they will have the longer ride to catch you. Be off now as quick as you may!"</div>

<div class="line_en">Still the next morning dawned bright and fair again. There was an autumn-like mist white upon the ground and the air was chill, but soon the sun rose red in the East and the mists vanished, and while the shadows were still long they were off again. So they rode now for two more days, and all the while they saw nothing save grass and flowers and birds and scattered trees, and occasionally small herds of red deer browsing or sitting at noon in the shade. Sometimes Bilbo saw the horns of the harts sticking up out of the long grass, and at first he thought they were the dead branches of trees. That third evening they were so eager to press on, for Beorn had said that they should reach the forest-gate early on the fourth-day, that they rode still forward after dusk and into the night beneath the moon. As the light faded Bilbo thought he saw away to the right, or to the left, the shadowy form of a great bear prowling along in the same direction. But if he dared to mention it to Gandalf, the wizard only said: "Hush! Take no notice!"</div>

As soon as it was light they could see the forest coming as it were to meet them, or waiting for them like a black and frowning wall before them. The land began to slope up and up, and it seemed to the hobbit that a silence began to draw in upon them. Birds began to sing less. There were no more deer; not even rabbits were to be seen. By the afternoon they had reached the eaves of Mirkwood, and were resting almost beneath the great overhanging boughs of its outer trees. Their trunks were huge and gnarled, their branches twisted, their leaves were dark and long. Ivy grew on them and trailed along the ground.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“不是！不是！”比尔博说，“我不是那个意思，我是想说，难道没有别的路可以绕过去吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There is, if you care to go two hundred miles or so out of your way north, and twice that south. But you wouldn't get a safe path even then. There are no safe paths in this part of the world. Remember you are over the Edge of the Wild now, and in for all sorts of fun wherever you go. Before you could get round Mirkwood in the North you would be right among the slopes of the Grey Mountains, and they are simply stiff with goblins, hobgoblins, and orcs of the worst description. Before you could get round it in the South, you would get into the land of the Necromancer; and even you, Bilbo, won't need me to tell you tales of that black sorcerer. I don't advise you to go anywhere near the places overlooked by his dark tower! Stick to the forest-track, keep your spirits up, hope for the best, and with a tremendous slice of luck you may come out one day and see the Long Marshes lying below you, and beyond them, high in the East, the Lonely Mountain where dear old Smaug lives, though I hope he is not expecting you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“有，如果你想要往北走上两百哩，然后再往南走上两倍距离的话。可即便那样，道路也不见得安全，这一带根本就没有什么安全的道路。记得，你们已经越过了野地的边缘，所以不管你去到哪里，都不会缺少？‘乐子’的。在你能够从北边绕过黑森林之前，你会一头撞进灰色山脉的各种山坡，那里到处都是半兽人、大半兽人，还有其他让人难以形容的可怕奥克。在你从南边绕过黑森林之前，你们将会踏入死灵法师的领土。比尔博，即使是你，也不需要我来告诉你这位黑色死灵法师的故事了吧。我建议你们最好不要靠近任何属于他那黑色势力范围内的地方！还是铁了心走森林这条路吧，抖擞精神，抱着最好的期望，只要再加上一份大大的运气，定会有一天能走出森林，看见长沼泽在你们的脚下。越过这片沼泽，兀然矗立在东边的，就是老斯毛格所住的孤山了，希望他不会预料到你们的出现。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Good-bye!" said Gandalf to Thorin. "And goodbye to you all, good-bye! Straight through the forest is your way now. Don't stray off the track! -- if you do, it is a thousand to one you will never find it again and never get out of Mirkwood; and then I don't suppose I, or any one else, will ever see you again."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“再见啦！”甘道夫对梭林说，“也和你们大家道别了，再会！你们应该直直地穿过森林，千万别走岔了路！——一旦迷了路的话，那你们重新找到路并且走出黑森林的机会只有千分之一。那样的话，我，或者是别的任何人，恐怕都再也看不到你们了！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Good-bye then, and really good-bye!" said Gandalf, and he turned his horse and rode down into the West. But he could not resist the temptation to have the last word. Before he had passed quite out of hearing he turned and put his hands to his mouth and called to them. They heard his voice come faintly: "Good-bye! Be good, take care of yourselves-and DON'T LEAVE THE PATH!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那就再会啦，真的告别了！”甘道夫拨转马头，朝着西方奔驰而去。但他实在忍不住还要最后叮咛几句。于是在他奔出众人的视野之前，他又转过头来，双手拢在嘴前对他们喊了起来。他们听见他的声音依稀传来：“再会！多保重——千万不要离开正路！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then he galloped away and was soon lost to sight. "O good-bye and go away!" grunted the dwarves, all the more angry because they were really filled with dismay at losing him. Now began the most dangerous part of all the journey. They each shouldered the heavy pack and the water-skin which was their share, and turned from the light that lay on the lands outside and plunged into the forest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后他就策马疾驰，很快消失在众人的视野外了。“哦，再见啦，快走吧！”矮人们咕哝道，心中更加生气了，因为他们真的为失去了他而感到郁闷。现在，全部旅程中最危险的部分开始了。每个人都背起了属于自己的那份沉重背包和水囊，离开了播洒在外面世界的光明，一头钻进了黑森林。">查看中文翻译</div>
