<div class="line_en">We followed the Indian down a sordid and common passage, ill-lit and worse furnished, until he came to a door upon the right, which he threw open. A blaze of yellow light streamed out upon us, and in the centre of the glare there stood a small man with a very high head, a bristle of red hair all round the fringe of it, and a bald, shining scalp which shot out from among it like a mountain-peak from fir-trees. He writhed his hands together as he stood, and his features were in a perpetual jerk -- now smiling, now scowling, but never for an instant in repose. Nature had given him a pendulous lip, and a too visible line of yellow and irregular teeth, which he strove feebly to conceal by constantly passing his hand over the lower part of his face. In spite of his obtrusive baldness he gave the impression of youth. In point of fact, he had just turned his thirtieth year.</div>

<div class="line_en">We were all astonished by the appearance of the apartment into which he invited us. In that sorry house it looked as out of place as a diamond of the first water in a setting of brass. The richest and glossiest of curtains and tapestries draped the walls, looped back here and there to expose some richly mounted painting or Oriental vase. The carpet was of amber and black, so soft and so thick that the foot sank pleasantly into it, as into a bed of moss. Two great tiger-skins thrown athwart it increased the suggestion of Eastern luxury, as did a huge hookah which stood upon a mat in the corner. A lamp in the fashion of a silver dove was hung from an almost invisible golden wire in the centre of the room. As it burned it filled the air with a subtle and aromatic odour.</div>

I took the liberty, therefore, of making an appointment in such a way that my man Williams might be able to see you first. I have complete confidence in his discretion, and he had orders, if he were dissatisfied, to proceed no further in the matter. You will excuse these precautions, but I am a man of somewhat retiring, and I might even say refined, tastes, and there is nothing more unaesthetic than a policeman. I have a natural shrinking from all forms of rough materialism. I seldom come in contact with the rough crowd. I live, as you see, with some little atmosphere of elegance around me. I may call myself a patron of the arts. It is my weakness. The landscape is a genuine Corot, and though a connoisseur might perhaps throw a doubt upon that Salvator Rosa, there cannot be the least question about the Bouguereau. I am partial to the modern French school."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当我最初决定要联系你的时候，”他说，“我也许应该给你我的地址，但我害怕你会无视我的要求，带来不合适的人。所以我才这样安排，叫我的仆人先和你们见面。我完全信任他的谨慎细心，我嘱咐过他，如果情形不对，就不要把事情进行下去。请原谅我的警惕，因为我是一个不愿与人来往的人，甚至可以说很孤傲，我认为，没有比警察更不文雅的人了。我天生就不喜欢任何粗俗、世故的人，也极少跟那些粗人接触。我的生活，如同你们所看到的，是十分雅致而高贵的。我可以自命为艺术鉴赏家。这是我的嗜好。那幅风景画确实是柯罗的真迹，有的鉴赏家也许会怀疑那幅塞尔瓦托·罗萨的作品的真伪，可是那幅布格罗的画毫无疑问是真品。我特别钟爱现代法国派。”">查看中文翻译</div>

We read the details in the papers, and knowing that he had been a friend of our father's we discussed the case freely in his presence. He used to join in our speculations as to what could have happened. Never for an instant did we suspect that he had the whole secret hidden in his own breast, that of all men he alone knew the fate of Arthur Morstan."</div>

<div class="line_en">"My father was, as you may have guessed, Major John Sholto, once of the Indian Army. He retired some eleven years ago and came to live at Pondicherry Lodge in Upper Norwood. He had prospered in India and brought back with him a considerable sum of money, a large collection of valuable curiosities, and a staff of native servants. With these advantages he bought himself a house, and lived in great luxury. My twin-brother Bartholomew and I were the only children."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我的父亲，也许你们能猜得到，就是过去在印度驻军里的约翰·肖尔托少校。大约在十一年前，他退休后，就住在了上诺伍德的本地治里别墅。他在印度发了一些财，带来一大笔钱和一批贵重的古玩，还有几个印度仆人。有了这些好条件，他就给自己买了一栋房子，住得很奢华。我和巴塞洛缪是孪生兄弟，我父亲只有我们这两个孩子。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We did know, however, that some mystery, some positive danger, overhung our father. He was very fearful of going out alone, and he always employed two prize-fighters to act as porters at Pondicherry Lodge. Williams, who drove you tonight, was one of them. He was once light-weight champion of England. Our father would never tell us what it was he feared, but he had a most marked aversion to men with wooden legs. On one occasion he actually fired his revolver at a wooden-legged man, who proved to be a harmless tradesman canvassing for orders. We had to pay a large sum to hush the matter up. My brother and I used to think this a mere whim of my father's, but events have since led us to change our opinion."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可是我们确实知道，有一些秘密——有一些恐怖的事——悬在我父亲心里。他非常害怕一个人独自出门，长期雇着两个职业拳击手为本地治里别墅看门。今天为你们赶车的那个威廉斯就是其中一个。他曾经是英国的轻量级拳击冠军。我们的父亲从来没有告诉过我们他在怕什么，不过，他对装有木腿的人非常戒备。曾经有一次，他打伤了一个装木腿的人，后来证实这个人只是一个来谈生意的寻常商人。我们不得不赔一大笔钱来摆平此事。我和哥哥曾经认为，这只是父亲的一时冲动，但事情的发展让我们改变了看法。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Early in 1882 my father received a letter from India which was a great shock to him. He nearly fainted at the breakfast-table when he opened it, and from that day he sickened to his death. What was in the letter we could never discover, but I could see as he held it that it was short and written in a scrawling hand. He had suffered for years from an enlarged spleen, but he now became rapidly worse, and towards the end of April we were informed that he was beyond all hope, and that he wished to make a last communication to us."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“一八八二年初，他收到了一封从印度寄来的信，那让他十分震惊。他一打开信，几乎就在早餐桌前晕倒了，从那天起，他就病了，直到病死。那封信的内容我们不得而知，但父亲拿着信的时候，我看出信很短，字迹也很潦草。他多年患着脾脏肿大的病，这一下，病情很快就恶化了，到了四月底，我们被告知他已没有希望了，他要对我们做最后的交代。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"'I have only one thing,' he said, 'which weighs upon my mind at this supreme moment. It is my treatment of poor Morstan's orphan. The cursed greed which has been my besetting sin through life has withheld from her the treasure, half at least of which should have been hers. And yet I have made no use of it myself, so blind and foolish a thing is avarice. The mere feeling of possession has been so dear to me that I could not bear to share it with another. See that chaplet tipped with pearls beside the quinine-bottle. Even that I could not bear to part with, although I had got it out with the design of sending it to her. You, my sons, will give her a fair share of the Agra treasure. But send her nothing -- not even the chaplet -- until I am gone. After all, men have been as bad as this and have recovered.'"</div>

When in India, he and I, through a remarkable chain of circumstances, came into possession of a considerable treasure. I brought it over to England, and on the night of Morstan's arrival he came straight over here to claim his share. He walked over from the station and was admitted by my faithful old Lal Chowdar, who is now dead. Morstan and I had a difference of opinion as to the division of the treasure, and we came to heated words. Morstan had sprung out of his chair in a paroxysm of anger, when he suddenly pressed his hand to his side, his face turned a dusky hue, and he fell backward, cutting his head against the corner of the treasure chest. When I stooped over him I found, to my horror, that he was dead.'"</div>

His death at the moment of a quarrel, and the gash in his head, would be black against me. Again, an official inquiry could not be made without bringing out some facts about the treasure, which I was particularly anxious to keep secret. He had told me that no soul upon earth knew where he had gone. There seemed to be no necessity why any soul ever should know.'"</div>

"Do not fear, sahib," he said; "no one need know that you have killed him. Let us hide him away, and who is the wiser?" "I did not kill him," said I. Lal Chowdar shook his head and smiled. "I heard it all, sahib," said he; "I heard you quarrel, and I heard the blow. But my lips are sealed. All are asleep in the house. Let us put him away together." That was enough to decide me. If my own servant could not believe my innocence, how could I hope to make it good before twelve foolish tradesmen in a jury-box? Lal Chowdar and I disposed of the body that night, and within a few days the London papers were full of the mysterious disappearance of Captain Morstan. You will see from what I say that I can hardly be blamed in the matter. My fault lies in the fact that we concealed not only the body but also the treasure and that I have clung to Morstan's share as well as to my own. I wish you, therefore, to make restitution.

<div class="line_en">"At this instant a horrible change came over his expression; his eyes stared wildly, his jaw dropped, and he yelled in a voice which I can never forget, 'Keep him out For Christ's sake keep him out!' We both stared round at the window behind us upon which his gaze was fixed. A face was looking in at us out of the darkness. We could see the whitening of the nose where it was pressed against the glass. It was a bearded, hairy face, with wild cruel eyes and an expression of concentrated malevolence. My brother and I rushed towards the window, but the man was gone. When we returned to my father his head had dropped and his pulse had ceased to beat."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“就在这个时候，他的表情忽然变得很可怕，他的双眼发狂地瞪着什么，嘴巴大张着，用一种我绝难忘怀的声音喊道，‘把他赶出去！哦，我的上帝，把他赶出去！’他的目光紧紧盯着窗户，于是，我们俩转身，向着窗户瞧去。一张面孔正在黑暗中凝视着我们。我们可以看到那只因压着玻璃而发白的鼻子。那是一张毛发丛生的脸，眼神狂野凶狠，还有着十分凶狠的表情。我和哥哥冲到了窗户前，可那人却已经走了。当我们回到父亲身边的时候，他已经垂下了头，脉搏停止了跳动。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We searched the garden that night but found no sign of the intruder save that just under the window a single footmark was visible in the flower-bed. But for that one trace, we might have thought that our imaginations had conjured up that wild, fierce face. We soon, however, had another and a more striking proof that there were secret agencies at work all round us. The window of my father's room was found open in the morning, his cupboards and boxes had been rifled, and upon his chest was fixed a torn piece of paper with the words 'The sign of the four' scrawled across it. What the phrase meant or who our secret visitor may have been, we never knew. As far as we can judge none of my father's property had been actually stolen, though everything had been turned out. My brother and I naturally associated this peculiar incident with the fear which haunted my father during his life, but it is still a complete mystery to us."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那一晚我们搜遍了花园，但却没有发现那个侵入者留下的任何痕迹，只是在窗户下的花台上，有一个脚印清晰可见。要不是有这么一个痕迹，我们或许还会以为，那张凶狠的脸庞只是我们的幻觉。但我和哥哥很快就发现了另一个更有力的证据，表明在我们的周围正在进行着什么秘密行动。我们在第二天早晨发现，父亲卧室的窗户大开，他的橱柜和箱子全都被搜查过，在他的箱子上钉着一张破纸，上面潦草地写着‘四签名’。而这几个字是什么意思，又或者那个神秘的访客是谁，我们都不知道。虽然所有的东西都被翻过了，但就我们所知，父亲的财产却没有被盗。我和哥哥非常自然地把这些怪事与困扰我父亲的恐惧联系起来，但这对于我们来说，也完全是一个谜。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"My brother and I," said he, "were, as you may imagine, much excited as to the treasure which my father had spoken of. For weeks and for months we dug and delved in every part of the garden without discovering its whereabouts. It was maddening to think that the hiding-place was on his very lips at the moment that he died. We could judge the splendour of the missing riches by the chaplet which he had taken out. Over this chaplet my brother Bartholomew and I had some little discussion. The pearls were evidently of great value, and he was averse to part with them, for, between friends, my brother was himself a little inclined to my father's fault. He thought, too, that if we parted with the chaplet it might give rise to gossip and finally bring us into trouble. It was all that I could do to persuade him to let me find out Miss Morstan's address and send her a detached pearl at fixed intervals so that at least she might never feel destitute."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我哥哥和我，”他继续说，“如你们所想，对于父亲所提及的财宝感到非常兴奋。我们连续挖了几个月，几乎把我们的花园都翻遍了，却没有发现任何财宝的踪影。一想到在他临死时，那个藏宝地就在他嘴边上了，我们就很恼怒。我们可以从他拿出的项圈看出，那些财宝有多么璀璨。关于这个项圈，我和哥哥巴塞洛缪也曾讨论过。那些珍珠明显非常值钱，他反对把它们给出去，因为，在对待朋友方面，他有跟我父亲一样的缺点。他认为，如果我们把项圈给出去的话，必然会引来谣言，并最终给我们带来麻烦。我能做的就是说服他让我找出摩斯坦小姐的地址，然后定时分别寄出那些分割开的珠子，至少保证她的生活不会困难。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The little man stopped to relight his hookah and puffed thoughtfully for a few moments. We had all sat absorbed, listening to his extraordinary narrative. At the short account of her father's death Miss Morstan had turned deadly white, and for a moment I feared that she was about to faint. She rallied, however, on drinking a glass of water which I quietly poured out for her from a Venetian carafe upon the side-table. Sherlock Holmes leaned back in his chair with an abstracted expression and the lids drawn low over his glittering eyes. As I glanced at him I could not but think how on that very day he had complained bitterly of the commonplaceness of life. Here at least was a problem which would tax his sagacity to the utmost. Mr. Thaddeus Sholto looked from one to the other of us with an obvious pride at the effect which his story had produced and then continued between the puffs of his overgrown pipe.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个矮小的男人停下来，重新点着了他的水烟壶，若有所思地连吸了几口。我们都全神贯注地听着他那离奇的描述。讲到她父亲之死的时候，摩斯坦小姐的脸变得苍白，那一会儿，我真害怕她会晕倒。不过，我从旁边桌子上的威尼斯式水瓶里倒了一杯水给她，她喝过之后，就缓过来了。舍洛克·福尔摩斯躺回到椅子上，神情凝重，眼睑低垂下来，盖住了他那发亮的眼睛。当我看着他的时候，我不禁想起，就在今天，他还痛苦地抱怨过，生活多么沉闷、无聊呢。而在这里，至少有一个难题将会极度考验他的智慧。塞迪厄斯·肖尔托先生对我们这个看看，那个瞧瞧，为他讲述的故事给我们带来的震撼而骄傲，他继续吸着水烟壶，又说了下去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The little man waved his hand deprecatingly. "We were your trustees," he said; "that was the view which I took of it, though Brother Bartholomew could not altogether see it in that light. We had plenty of money ourselves. I desired no more. Besides, it would have been such bad taste to have treated a young lady in so scurvy a fashion. 'Le mauvais goût mène au crime.' The French have a very neat way of putting these things. Our difference of opinion on this subject went so far that I thought it best to set up rooms for myself; so I left Pondicherry Lodge, taking the old khitmutgar and Williams with me. Yesterday, however, I learned that an event of extreme importance has occurred. The treasure has been discovered. I instantly communicated with Miss Morstan, and it only remains for us to drive out to Norwood and demand our share. I explained my views last night to Brother Bartholomew, so we shall be expected, if not welcome, visitors."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Bartholomew is a clever fellow," said he. "How do you think he found out where the treasure was? He had come to the conclusion that it was somewhere indoors, so he worked out all the cubic space of the house and made measurements everywhere so that not one inch should be unaccounted for. Among other things, he found that the height of the building was seventy-four feet, but on adding together the heights of all the separate rooms and making every allowance for the space between, which he ascertained by borings, he could not bring the total to more than seventy feet. There were four feet unaccounted for. These could only be at the top of the building. He knocked a hole, therefore, in the lath and plaster ceiling of the highest room, and there, sure enough, he came upon another little garret above it, which had been sealed up and was known to no one. In the centre stood the treasure-chest resting upon two rafters. He lowered it through the hole, and there it lies. He computes the value of the jewels at not less than half a million sterling."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“巴塞洛缪是一个聪明人，”他说，“你们知道他是怎么找到宝藏的吗？他得出宝藏一定在室内的结论，于是，他计算出了整所房子的立体面积，测量了每个角落，没有漏算一英寸的地方。从这些勘测之中，他发现房子的高度是七十四英尺，可是，他把所有各个房间的高度都分别衡量过了，还用钻探方法确定了楼板的厚度，把这些都加上，总共也不过七十英尺。还差了四英尺。这差的高度唯有从屋顶去找。他在用板条和灰泥砌成的天花板上打了一个洞，果然在那里找到了一个封闭着的、任何人也不知道的阁楼。那个宝箱就摆在天花板中央的两条椽木上。他把宝箱从洞口取了下来，珠宝就在里面。他计算了一下这些宝物的价值，估计不少于五十万英镑。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At the mention of this gigantic sum we all stared at one another open-eyed. Miss Morstan, could we secure her rights, would change from a needy governess to the richest heiress in England. Surely it was the place of a loyal friend to rejoice at such news, yet I am ashamed to say that selfishness took me by the soul and that my heart turned as heavy as lead within me. I stammered out some few halting words of congratulation and then sat downcast, with my head drooped, deaf to the babble of our new acquaintance. He was clearly a confirmed hypochondriac, and I was dreamily conscious that he was pouring forth interminable trains of symptoms, and imploring information as to the composition and action of innumerable quack nostrums, some of which he bore about in a leather case in his pocket. I trust that he may not remember any of the answers which I gave him that night. Holmes declares that he overheard me caution him against the great danger of taking more than two drops of castor-oil, while I recommended strychnine in large doses as a sedative. However that may be, I was certainly relieved when our cab pulled up with a jerk and the coachman sprang down to open the door.</div>
