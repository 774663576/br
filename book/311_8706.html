<div class="line_cn" title="她俩体育课同班，这也完全合理，因为体育课就是地狱的延伸，而提娜绝对是个大魔头，一个诡异的迷你版玩具魔头。并且，她有一大群小魔头追随，全都穿着成套的运动服。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他妈妈走到乔许背后，照着他后脑勺就来了一下。“别说脏话，臭嘴。”她得踮起脚才能敲到乔许的脑袋。乔许完全是爸爸的亲儿子，他已经比妈妈高出了七英寸，比帕克高三英寸。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="这也太糟糕了。">查看中文翻译</div>

Maybe he could take a Sharpie to all Josh's Husker football T-shirts and make them say Husker Dü. Or maybe it wouldn't even be an issue -- Park might never get any taller than five foot four.
