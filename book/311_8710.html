<div class="line_en">Eleanor put the comics between her books and stared at the window. For some reason, she didn't want to read in front of him. It would be like letting him watch her eat. It would be like… admitting something.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃莉诺把漫画插在课本里，望着窗外。不知道为什么，她不想当着他的面翻这些漫画。这就像让他看见她吃东西的模样，就像…承认了某些东西。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That night, after her brothers and sister fell asleep, Eleanor turned the light back on so she could read. They were the loudest sleepers ever. Ben talked in his sleep, and Maisie and the baby both snored. Mouse wet the bed -- which didn't make noise, but still disturbed the general peace. The light didn't seem to bother them though.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天晚上，孩子们都睡着后，她开灯读起了漫画。这些家伙连睡觉都吵得很，班恩会说梦话，梅西和小婴儿会打呼，鼠鼠会尿床，虽然不吵，但也破坏安宁。不过灯光倒不会干扰他们。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Eleanor was only distantly conscious of Richie watching TV in the next room, and she practically fell off the bed when he jerked the bedroom door open. He looked like he expected to catch some middle-of-the-night hijinks, but when he saw that it was only Eleanor and that she was just reading, he grunted and told her to turn out the light so the little kids could sleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃莉诺隐约知道雷奇在隔壁房间看电视，因此，当他忽地拉开房门时，她差点摔下床。他一副要逮住他们半夜狂欢作乐的模样，发现只是埃莉诺在看书，便只嘟囔着要她关灯，免得孩子们睡不安稳。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He looked exactly like a rat. Like the human-being version of a rat. Like the villain in a Don Bluth movie. Who knew what her mom saw in him; Eleanor's dad was messed-up-looking, too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他活脱脱就是鼠辈，贼眉鼠眼，像唐·布鲁斯（26）画的坏蛋。天知道她妈妈究竟看中他哪一点；埃莉诺的爸爸也是一脸落魄。【注：（26）唐·布鲁斯（Don Bluth），美国著名动画师。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Every once in a while -- when Richie managed to take a bath, put on decent clothes and stay sober all on the same day -- Eleanor could sort of see why her mom might have thought he was handsome. Thank the Lord that didn't happen very often. When it did, Eleanor felt like going to the bathroom and sticking a finger down her throat.</div>

<div class="line_en">She'd read all of his Alan Moore in less than three weeks. Now he was giving her X-Men comics five at a time, and he could tell that she liked them because she wrote the characters" names on her books, in between band names and song lyrics.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不到三星期，她就看完了艾伦·摩尔的所有漫画。现在他每次给她五本《X漫画》，看得出她很喜欢，因为她会在课本上涂写书中人物的名字，在乐队名字与歌词间。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She read stuff as fast as he could give it to her. And when she handed it back to him the next morning, she always acted as if she were handing him something fragile. Something precious. You wouldn't even know that she touched the comics except for the smell.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他给得快，她读得也快。每当她第二天还书，都好像在送还某种易碎而珍贵的东西。要不是那股香味，简直看不出她已经读了那些漫画。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Park would have to talk to her today -- to tell her that he didn't have anything to give her. He'd overslept, then forgotten to grab the stack of comics he'd set out for her the night before. He hadn't even had time to eat breakfast or brush his teeth, which made him self-conscious, knowing he was going to be sitting so close to her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="帕克今天非跟她说话不可——说今天没漫画可借她。他早上起晚了，忘了拿昨晚为她准备好的漫画。他没时间吃饭，连牙都没刷，想到坐得离她那么近，却没刷牙，他就很不自在。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Every book Park lent her came back smelling like perfume. Not like the perfume his mom wore. (Imari.) And not like the new girl; she smelled like vanilla.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="帕克借给她的每一本书，还回来时都有股香水味。不是他妈妈擦的艾玛莉，也不是那女孩身上的香草味。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They still didn't talk on the bus, but it had become a less confrontational silence. Almost friendly. (But not quite.)</div>

<div class="line_en">She was wearing that ugly necktie again. Today it was tied around her wrist. Her arms and wrists were scattered with freckles, layers of them in different shades of gold and pink, even on the back of her hands. Little-boy hands, his mom would call them, with short-short nails and ragged cuticles.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她又绑了那条丑陋的领带，今天是绑在手腕上。她的手臂和手腕布满金黄与粉红的雀斑，层层交叠，就连手背都不例外。这是他妈妈所谓的“小男孩的手”，短而又短的指甲，指尖不平整的皮肤。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She stared down at the books in her lap. Maybe she thought he was mad at her. He stared at her books, too -- covered in ink and Art Nouveau doodles.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她盯着着腿上的书。或许她以为帕克生气了。他也瞄了瞄她的书，那上面涂满了墨水与新艺术涂鸦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But when she got on the bus and handed him yesterday's comics, all Park did was shrug. She looked away. They both looked down.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是当她上车，把漫画还给他时，帕克只是耸耸肩。她转过头。两人目光低垂。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="帕克不知道她是不是天生“嘴贱”，但显然，她也不想压抑这种天性。气氛瞬间变僵了。帕克移动身体靠着墙壁。她则把视线转向走道另一侧的窗外。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“是‘天啊，他真可爱’的那种一见钟情吗？如果莎士比亚真的要让读者相信他们深爱彼此，就不会在第一幕指出罗密欧当时正迷恋罗萨兰…这是莎士比亚在嘲笑爱情。”">查看中文翻译</div>
