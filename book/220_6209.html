<div class="line_en">But side by side with this went a contradictory trait -- a strong sense of justice. It is abhorrent to me that an innocent person or creature should suffer or die by any act of mine. I have always felt strongly that right should prevail.</div>

<div class="line_en">From my earliest youth I realized that my nature was a mass of contradictions. I have to begin with, an incurably romantic imagination. The practice of throwing a bottle into the sea with an important document inside was one that never failed to thrill me when reading adventure stories as a child. It thrills me still -- and for that reason I have adopted this course -- writing my confession, enclosing it in a bottle, sealing the latter, and casting it into the waves. There is, I suppose, a hundred to one chance that my confession may be found -- and then (or do I flatter myself!) a hitherto unsolved murder mystery will be explained.</div>

<div class="line_en">When in due course I came to preside over a court of law, that other secret instinct of mine was encouraged to develop. To see a wretched criminal squirming in the dock, suffering the tortures of the damned, as his doom came slowly and slowly nearer, was to me an exquisite pleasure. Mind you, I took no pleasure in seeing an innocent man there. On at least two occasions I stopped cases where to my mind the accused was palpably innocent, directing the jury that there was no case. Thanks, however, to the fairness and efficiency of our police force, the majority of the accused persons who have come before me to be tried for murder, have been guilty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过了若干年我当了法官，我的另一种隐秘的天性受到鼓舞而发展起来。当我看到一个倒霉的罪犯在被告席上痛苦挣扎，受尽折磨，毁灭慢慢地、一步一步地向他走近时，总是感到莫大的快乐。不过请注意，如果被告席上站的是一个无辜的人，我是没有这种快乐心情的。至少有两次，因为深知被告是无罪的，我中止了审判，并向陪审团指出指控不能成立。不过，感谢我们的保安部门的公正和效率，那些带到我面前以杀人罪受审的被告，绝大部分都是犯了罪的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I will say here that such was the case with the man Edward Seton. His appearance and manner were misleading and he created a good impression on the jury.

<div class="line_en">And he instanced a particular case -- that of an old lady, a patient of his who had recently died. He was, he said, himself convinced that her death was due to the withholding of a restorative drug by a married couple who attended on her and who stood to benefit very substantially by her death. That sort of thing, he explained, was quite impossible to prove, but he was nevertheless quite sure of it in his own mind. He added that there were many cases of a similar nature going on all the time -- cases of deliberate murder -- and all quite untouchable by the law.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他举了一个例子——关于一个老妇人，最近死去的他的一个病人。他说他个人认为这个老妇人的死是由于一对照料她的夫妇故意不给她服急救药，他们能够在她死后，得到很大一笔遗产。他解释说，这类事极不容易证明，但他仍然深信不疑这对夫妇确实是干了这件昧了良心的事。他又说了许多与之类似的不断发生的案件——作案极其狡诈，全都是法律无法制裁的。">查看中文翻译</div>

I had a certain routine line of conversation which I employed with nearly every one I met -- and the results I got were really surprising. During the time I was in a nursing home I collected the case of Dr. Armstrong -- a violently teetotal sister who attended on me being anxious to prove to me the evils of drink by recounting to me a case many years ago in hospital when a doctor under the influence of alcohol had killed a patient on whom he was operating. A careless question as to where the sister in question had trained, etc., soon gave me the necessary data. I tracked down the doctor and the patient mentioned without difficulty.</div>

<div class="line_en">A conversation between two old military gossips in my Club put me on the track of General Macarthur. A man who had recently returned from the Amazon gave me a devastating resume of the activities of one Philip Lombard. An indignant mem sahib in Majorca recounted the tale of the Puritan Emily Brent and her wretched servant girl. Anthony Marston I selected from a large group of people who had committed similar offences. His complete callousness and his inability to feel any responsibility for the lives he had taken made him, I considered, a type dangerous to the community and unfit to live. Ex-Inspector Blore came my way quite naturally, some of my professional brethren discussing the Landor case with freedom and vigour. I took a serious view of his offence. The police, as servants of the law, must be of a high order of integrity. For their word is perforce believed by virtue of their profession.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="通过和俱乐部两个老军人的闲聊，我发现了麦克阿瑟。一个刚从亚马逊河回来的人告诉我菲利普·隆巴德的情况。从玛约喀来的一位先生气愤不平地给我讲述了清教徒埃米莉·布伦特小姐和她那死去的女仆的故事。安东尼·马斯顿是我从一大堆和他犯了同祥罪的杀人犯中挑选出来的。我觉得他对他撞死的两个孩子无动于衷，对人类生命不负责任，这种态度使他成为社会上的危险分子，不应该继续留在人世。退职警官布洛尔列入我的名单非常自然，我的一些同事曾十分坦率地讨论过兰德的案子。我当时就认为他的伪证罪十分严重，身为警察，法律的公仆，必须是高度正直的，因为这种人的证词别人总是相信的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Hugo Hamilton was unhappy. To assuage that unhappiness he had taken a considerable quantity of drink. He was in the maudlin confidential stage. Without much hope of any result I automatically started my routine conversational gambit. The response was startling. I can remember his words now. He said: "You're right. Murder isn't what most people think -- giving some one a dollop of arsenic -- pushing them over a cliff -- that sort of stuff." He leaned forward, thrusting his face into mine. He said: "I've known a murderess -- known her, I tell you. And what's more I was crazy about her… God help me, sometimes I think I still am… It's Hell, I tell you -- Hell -- You see, she did it more or less for me… Not that I ever dreamed.

They know, therefore, that one of the ten people on the island was not a murderer in any sense of the word, and it follows, paradoxically, that that person must logically be the murderer. The second clue lies in the seventh verse of the nursery rhyme. Armstrong's death is associated with a "red herring" which he swallowed -- or rather which resulted in swallowing him! That is to say that at that stage of the affair some hocus-pocus is clearly indicated -- and that Armstrong was deceived by it and sent to his death. That might start a promising line of inquiry. For at that period there are only four persons and of those four I am clearly the only one likely to inspire him with confidence.</div>
