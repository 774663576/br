<div class="line_en">Mrs. Jennings was very warm in her praise of Edward's conduct, but onlyElinor and Marianne understood its true merit. THEY only knew howlittle he had had to tempt him to be disobedient, and how small was theconsolation, beyond the consciousness of doing right, that could remainto him in the loss of friends and fortune. Elinor gloried in hisintegrity; and Marianne forgave all his offences in compassion for hispunishment. But though confidence between them was, by this publicdiscovery, restored to its proper state, it was not a subject on whicheither of them were fond of dwelling when alone. Elinor avoided itupon principle, as tending to fix still more upon her thoughts, by thetoo warm, too positive assurances of Marianne, that belief of Edward'scontinued affection for herself which she rather wished to do away; andMarianne's courage soon failed her, in trying to converse upon a topicwhich always left her more dissatisfied with herself than ever, by thecomparison it necessarily produced between Elinor's conduct and her own.</div>

But though so much of thematter was known to them already, that Mrs. Jennings might have hadenough to do in spreading that knowledge farther, without seeking aftermore, she had resolved from the first to pay a visit of comfort andinquiry to her cousins as soon as she could; and nothing but thehindrance of more visitors than usual, had prevented her going to themwithin that time.</div>

<div class="line_en">She felt all the force of that comparison; but not as her sister hadhoped, to urge her to exertion now; she felt it with all the pain ofcontinual self-reproach, regretted most bitterly that she had neverexerted herself before; but it brought only the torture of penitence, without the hope of amendment. Her mind was so much weakened that shestill fancied present exertion impossible, and therefore it onlydispirited her more.</div>

<div class="line_en">An intimate acquaintance of Mrs. Jennings joined them soon after theyentered the Gardens, and Elinor was not sorry that by her continuingwith them, and engaging all Mrs. Jennings's conversation, she washerself left to quiet reflection. She saw nothing of the Willoughbys, nothing of Edward, and for some time nothing of anybody who could byany chance whether grave or gay, be interesting to her. But at lastshe found herself with some surprise, accosted by Miss Steele, who, though looking rather shy, expressed great satisfaction in meetingthem, and on receiving encouragement from the particular kindness ofMrs. Jennings, left her own party for a short time, to join their's. Mrs. Jennings immediately whispered to Elinor,</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh, did not you? But it WAS said, I know, very well, and by more than one; for Miss Godby told Miss Sparks, that nobody in their senses couldexpect Mr. Ferrars to give up a woman like Miss Morton, with thirty thousand pounds to her fortune, for Lucy Steele that had nothing at all; and I had it from Miss Sparks myself. And besides that, my cousinRichard said himself, that when it came to the point he was afraid Mr. Ferrars would be off; and when Edward did not come near us for three days, I could not tell what to think myself; and I believe in my heartLucy gave it up all for lost; for we came away from your brother's Wednesday, and we saw nothing of him not all Thursday, Friday, andSaturday, and did not know what was become of him. Once Lucy thoughtto write to him, but then her spirits rose against that. However this morning he came just as we came home from church; and then it all cameout, how he had been sent for Wednesday to Harley Street, and been talked to by his mother and all of them, and how he had declared beforethem all that he loved nobody but Lucy, and nobody but Lucy would he have. And how he had been so worried by what passed, that as soon ashe had went away from his mother's house, he had got upon his horse, and rid into the country, some where or other; and how he had stayed about at an inn all Thursday and Friday, on purpose to get the betterof it. And after thinking it all over and over again, he said, itseemed to him as if, now he had no fortune, and no nothing at all, it would be quite unkind to keep her on to the engagement, because it mustbe for her loss, for he had nothing but two thousand pounds, and no hope of any thing else; and if he was to go into orders, as he had some thoughts, he could get nothing but a curacy, and how was they to live upon that?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="噢！真的吗？但是我很清楚，确实有人说过，而且不止一个人。戈德比小姐就对斯帕克斯小姐说过：凡是有点理智的人，谁也不会认为费拉斯先生肯放弃像莫顿小姐这样一位有三万镑财产的女子，而去娶—个一无所有的露西。斯蒂尔。这话我是听斯帕克斯小姐亲口说的。况且，我表兄理查德还亲自说过，到了节骨眼上，他担心费拉斯先生会变卦。爱德华有三天没接近我们了，我也说不出自己该怎么想。我从心底里相信，露西己经认定没有希望了，因为我们星期三离开你哥哥家，星期四、五、六整整三天都没见到他，也不知道爱德华怎么样啦。露西一度想给他写信，随即又打消了这个念头。不过，我们今天上午刚从教堂回到家，他就来了，于是事情全搞清楚了。原来，他星期三被叫到哈利街，他母亲一伙找他谈话，他当着她们大家公开宣布：他是非露西不爱，非露西不娶。他被这些事情搞得心烦意乱，一跨出他母亲的门槛便骑上马，跑到了乡下什么地方。星期四、五两天，他呆在一家客栈里，以便消消气。经过再三考虑，他说他现在没有财产，没有一切，再和露西继续保持婚约，似乎太不人道，那要让她跟着受苦了，因为他只有两千镑，没有希望得到别的收入。他想过，去做牧师，即使这祥，也只能捞个副牧师的职位，他们怎么能靠此维持生活呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But, to be sure, Lucy would not give ear to such kind of talking; so shetold him directly (with a great deal about sweet and love, you know, and all that-Oh, la! one can't repeat such kind of things you know) -- she told him directly, she had not the least mind in the world to be off, for she could live with him upon a trifle, and how little soever he might have, she should be very glad to have it all, you know, or something of the kind. So then he was monstrous happy, and talked on some time about what they should do, and they agreed he should take orders directly, and they must wait to be married till he got a living. And just then I could not hear any more, for my cousin called from below to tell me Mrs. Richardson was come in her coach, and would take one of us to Kensington Gardens; so I was forced to go into the room and interrupt them, to ask Lucy if she would like to go, but she did not care to leave Edward; so I just run up stairs and put on a pair of silk stockings and came off with the Richardsons."</div>

<div class="line_en">As soon as they returned to the carriage, Mrs. Jennings was eager forinformation; but as Elinor wished to spread as little as possibleintelligence that had in the first place been so unfairly obtained, sheconfined herself to the brief repetition of such simple particulars, asshe felt assured that Lucy, for the sake of her own consequence, wouldchoose to have known. The continuance of their engagement, and themeans that were able to be taken for promoting its end, was all hercommunication; and this produced from Mrs. Jennings the followingnatural remark.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她们一回到马车里，詹宁斯太太就迫不及待地打听消息。但是埃丽诺觉得那些消息起先是通过不正当途径窃取的，还是尽量少传播为好，因而她只是敷衍了事地重复了几个简单的情况。她确信，露西为了抬高自己的身价，也愿意让人知道这些情况。他们还继续保持着婚约，以及采取什么办法来达到目的，这是她叙说的全部内容。詹宁斯太太听了之后，自然而然地发出了以下的议论：">查看中文翻译</div>

Edward's marriage with Lucy was as firmlydetermined on, and the time of its taking place remained as absolutelyuncertain, as she had concluded it would be; -- every thing depended, exactly after her expectation, on his getting that preferment, ofwhich, at present, there seemed not the smallest chance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这就是她临别时所表示的担心。说完这话，她刚刚向詹宁斯太太最后恭维了几句，便被理查森夫人叫走了。埃丽诺从她那儿了解到一些情况，虽说都是她早已预想得到的，倒可以促使她再冥思暇想一阵子。同她推断的情况一样，爱德华要同露西结婚，这是确定无疑的，至于何时举行婚礼，却不能确定。正如她所料，一切取决于他获得那个牧师职位，但这在当前是没有丝毫指望的。">查看中文翻译</div>
