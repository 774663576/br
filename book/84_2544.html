<div class="line_en">I tried to imagine what future such a woman might claim for herself. I tried to conjure other scenes in which she and her father were of two minds. When she ignored his counsel and kept her own. But my father had taught me that there are not two reasonable opinions to be had on any subject: there is Truth and there are Lies. I knelt on the carpet, listening to my father but studying this stranger, and felt suspended between them, drawn to each, repelled by both. I understood that no future could hold them; no destiny could tolerate him and her. I would remain a child, in perpetuity, always, or I would lose him.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a moment that winter. I was kneeling on the carpet, listening to Dad testify of Mother's calling as a healer, when my breath caught in my chest and I felt taken out of myself. I no longer saw my parents or our living room. What I saw was a woman grown, with her own mind, her own prayers, who no longer sat, childlike, at her father's feet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那是冬日的一天。我跪在地毯上，听爸爸为母亲受感召成为治疗者而作证时，一口气堵在胸口，感觉自己游离了出来。眼前不见父母和我们的起居室。我看见一个成年女人，她有自己的思想，有自己的祈祷，不再像孩子一样坐在父亲的脚边。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I saw the woman's swollen belly and it was my belly. Next to her sat her mother, the midwife. She took her mother's hand and said she wanted the baby delivered in a hospital, by a doctor. I'll drive you, her mother said. The women moved toward the door, but the door was blocked -- by loyalty, by obedience. By her father. He stood, immovable. But the woman was his daughter, and she had drawn to herself all his conviction, all his weightiness. She set him aside and moved through the door.</div>

<div class="line_en">He strode past me and sat on my bed, then patted the mattress next to him. I took my seat, nervously, my feet barely touching the floor. I waited for him to speak, but the moments passed silently. His eyes were closed, his jaw slackened, as if he were listening to seraphic voices. "I've been praying," he said. His voice was soft, a loving voice. "I've been praying about your decision to go to college."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他大步从我身边走过，坐在我的床上，然后拍了拍旁边的床垫。我紧张地坐下来，双脚几乎碰不到地面。我等着他开口说话，但时间在无声地流逝。他闭上眼睛，下巴放松，好像在聆听天使的声音。“我一直在祈祷，”他说，他声音轻柔，充满爱意，“我一直在为你上大学的决定而祈祷。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was an icy morning, much like the first, when I returned to the junkyard. It had changed. There were still pillars of mangled cars but they no longer dominated the landscape. A few years before, Dad had been hired by Utah Power to dismantle hundreds of utility towers. He had been allowed to keep the angle iron, and it was now stacked -- four hundred thousand pounds of it -- in tangled mountains all over the yard.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那是一个寒冷的早晨，和我第一次来废料场干活时一样。废料场变了样。虽然那里仍然堆放着如山的废旧汽车，但它们不再是主导周围的景观了。几年前，犹他州电力公司雇爸爸拆除了数百座设备塔，允许他留下角铁——共计四十万磅——如今它们就像小山一样乱七八糟地堆放在院子各处。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I woke up every morning at six to study -- because it was easier to focus in the mornings, before I was worn out from scrapping.

And if God acted, then surely my going to school was His will.</div>

<div class="line_en">The ACT was composed of four sections: math, English, science and reading. My math skills were improving but they were not strong. While I could answer most of the questions on the practice exam, I was slow, needing double or triple the allotted time. I lacked even a basic knowledge of grammar, though I was learning, beginning with nouns and moving on to prepositions and gerunds. Science was a mystery, perhaps because the only science book I'd ever read had had detachable pages for coloring. Of the four sections, reading was the only one about which I felt confident.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大学入学考试由四部分组成：数学、英语、科学和阅读。我的数学能力正在提高，但并不强。虽然我能解出大部分习题，但做题速度很慢，需要规定时间的两到三倍。我甚至连最基本的语法知识都没有，尽管我正在学习，从名词开始，接下来是介词和动名词。科学是一个谜，可能是因为我读过的唯一一本科学书还是那种可拆下来涂色的。四部分中，我唯一感到自信的是阅读。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I didn't sleep the night before. My brain conjured so many scenes of disaster, it burned as if with a fever. At five I got out of bed, ate breakfast, and drove the forty miles to Utah State University. I was led into a white classroom with thirty other students, who took their seats and placed their pencils on their desks. A middle-aged woman handed out tests and strange pink sheets I'd never seen before.</div>

He returned an hour later, and when he caught sight of me he paused mid-step, confused. He'd told me what to do, and I hadn't done it. He stood uncertainly for a moment, then crossed over to me, took hold of both sleeves and jerked them down. He didn't make it ten steps before I'd rolled them up again.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was an unusually hot day that spring, and Luke and I spent it hauling purlins -- the iron beams that run horizontally along the length of a roof. The purlins were heavy and the sun relentless. Sweat dripped from our noses and onto the painted iron. Luke slipped out of his shirt, grabbed hold of the sleeves and tore them, leaving huge gashes a breeze could pass through. I wouldn't have dreamed of doing anything so radical, but after the twentieth purlin my back was sticky with sweat, and I flapped my T-shirt to make a fan, then rolled up my sleeves until an inch of my shoulders was visible. When Dad saw me a few minutes later, he strode over and yanked the sleeves down. "This ain't a whorehouse," he said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那年春天有一天天气异常炎热，我和卢克一整天都在拖檩条——水平横跨屋顶的铁梁。檩条沉重，太阳毒辣。汗水顺着我们的鼻子淌下来，滴在喷过漆的铁上。卢克脱下衬衫，抓住袖子扯出几道巨大的口子，让风可以吹进去。这么极端的做法我连想都不敢想，但在背了二十根檩条后，我的背上全是黏糊糊的汗，我拍打着T恤扇风，然后卷起袖子，露出一英寸肩膀。几分钟后，爸爸看到我，大步走过来，一把拉下我的袖子。“这儿不是妓院。”他说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Shawn returned to work, hobbling unsteadily. He wore an Aussie outback hat, which was large, wide-brimmed, and made of chocolate-brown oiled leather. Before the accident, he had worn the hat only when riding horses, but now he kept it on all the time, even in the house, which Dad said was disrespectful. Disrespecting Dad might have been the reason Shawn wore it, but I suspect another reason was that it was large and comfortable and covered the scars from his surgery.</div>

<div class="line_en">A few days later Dad came home with the most frightening machine I've ever seen. He called it the Shear. At first glance it appeared to be a three-ton pair of scissors, and this turned out to be exactly what it was. The blades were made of dense iron, twelve inches thick and five feet across. They cut not by sharpness but by force and mass. They bit down, their great jaws propelled by a heavy piston attached to a large iron wheel. The wheel was animated by a belt and motor, which meant that if something got caught in the machine, it would take anywhere from thirty seconds to a minute to stop the wheel and halt the blades. Up and down they roared, louder than a passing train as they chewed through iron as thick as a man's arm. The iron wasn't being cut so much as snapped. Sometimes it would buck, propelling whoever was holding it toward the dull, chomping blades.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几天后，爸爸将一台我见过的最吓人的机器带回了家。他称之为“大剪刀”。乍一看，它似乎是一把重达三吨的剪刀，事实也的确如此。刀刃十二英寸厚，五英尺宽，由高密度铁制成，切割物体不是靠锋利，而是靠蛮力。它们咬合下去，巨大的颚由一个附在大铁轮上的沉重活塞推进。轮子由皮带和马达驱动，这意味着如果有什么东西被机器卡住，得花半分钟到一分钟才能让轮子和刀刃停下来。它们咀嚼着人的手臂一样粗的铁，上下咆哮着，声音比途经的列车还响。铁与其说是被切断的，不如说是被拦腰折断的。有时铁会奋力抵抗，将拿着它的人朝正在咀嚼的钝重的刀刃推去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Luke, Benjamin and I were scrapping. Dad had decided it was time to salvage the angle iron stacked all around the farm. To be sold, each piece had to measure less than four feet. Shawn suggested we use torches to cut the iron, but Dad said it would be too slow and cost too much in fuel.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dad had dreamed up many dangerous schemes over the years, but this was the first that really shocked me. Perhaps it was the obvious lethality of it, the certainty that a wrong move would cost a limb. Or maybe that it was utterly unnecessary. It was indulgent. Like a toy, if a toy could take your head off.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="多年以来，爸爸想出过若干危险计划，但这是第一次让我真正感到震惊的。也许这个办法有着明显的致命性，稍有闪失必会残肢断臂。或许完全没有使用它的必要。这就是任性。它就像一个玩具，如果玩具能把你的头切下来的话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Shawn called it a death machine and said Dad had lost what little sense he'd ever had. "Are you trying to kill someone?" he said. "Because I got a gun in my truck that will make a lot less mess." Dad couldn't suppress his grin. I'd never seen him so enraptured.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="肖恩称它为“死亡机器”，并说爸爸丧失了仅剩的一丝理智。“你是想杀人吗？”他说，“我卡车里有把枪，杀人比这个利索多了。”爸爸忍不住笑了。我从未见过他如此欣喜若狂。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Shawn lurched back to the shop, shaking his head. Dad began feeding iron through the Shear. Each length bucked him forward and twice he nearly pitched headfirst into the blades. I jammed my eyes shut, knowing that if Dad's head got caught, the blades wouldn't even slow, just hack through his neck and keep chomping.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="肖恩摇摇头一瘸一拐地回到工作间。爸爸开始将角铁喂给大剪刀。每剪一段他都被顶向前去，有两次他几乎头朝下撞在刀刃上。我紧紧闭上眼睛，知道万一爸爸的头被卡住，刀刃不会放慢速度，只会咬穿他的脖子，不停咀嚼。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我慢慢地走向前，眼睛一眨不眨地看着大剪刀，好像它会随时发动攻击。刀刃上还有卢克的血。爸爸拿起一根六英尺长的角铁，把一头递给我。“抓紧了，”他说，“一旦它开始较劲儿，立刻松手。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I prayed when I fed the first piece to the blades. Not to avoid injury -- there was no possibility of that -- but that the injury would be like Luke's, a wedge of flesh, so I could go to the house, too. I chose smaller pieces, hoping my weight could control the lurch. Then I ran out of small pieces. I picked up the smallest of what was left, but the metal was still thick. I shoved it through and waited for the jaws to crash shut. The sound of solid iron fracturing was thunderous. The iron bucked, tossing me forward so both my feet left the ground. I let go and collapsed in the dirt, and the iron, now free, and being chewed violently by the blades, launched into the air then crashed down next to me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="把第一块铁放到刀刃中间时，我祈祷着。不是祈祷别受伤——这是不可能的——而是祈祷受的伤能像卢克一样，被咬掉一块肉，这样我也可以回家了。我挑了一块小一点的，希望我的重量能控制住它的突然倾斜。小块的铁切完了。我从剩下的里面再挑一块最小的，但铁仍然很厚。我将它推过去，等着剪刀的下颚猛地合上。铁的噪音震耳欲聋。铁的反作用力将我向前推，让我双脚离地。我松开手，瘫倒在泥地里。这时，从我手中脱离的铁被刀刃猛咬一番，弹到了空中，接着轰的一声掉在我旁边。">查看中文翻译</div>

He was cracked in the head many times when a length of iron bucked at an unexpected angle.
