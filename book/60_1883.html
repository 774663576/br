<div class="line_en">But there was no turning back. So she phoned him from the station, and the moment he opened the door, her stomach started rumbling terribly. She was mortified. She felt as though she were carrying her mother in her stomach and her mother had guffawed to spoil her meeting with Tomas.</div>

<div class="line_en">During the journey, she made frequent trips to the toilet to look in the mirror and beg her soul not to abandon the deck of her body for a moment on this most crucial day of her life. Scrutinizing herself on one such trip, she had a sudden scare: she felt a scratch in her throat. Could she be coming down with something on this most crucial day of her life?</div>

<div class="line_en">For the first few seconds, she was afraid he would throw her out because of the crude noises she was making, but then he put his arms around her. She was grateful to him for ignoring her rumbles, and kissed him passionately, her eyes misting. Before the first minute was up, they were making love. She screamed while making love. She had a fever by then. She had come down with the flu. The nozzle of the hose supplying oxygen to the lungs was stuffed and red.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一开始她以为他会因为这失礼的响声将她拒之门外，而他却把她一下子拥在怀中。她感激他并不介意她肚子里发出的咕噜声，泪眼朦胧，倍加狂热地亲他。没过一分钟，他们就做起爱来。做爱的时候，她一直在叫着。她已经在发烧，她感冒了。那条给肺部输送空气的管道红红的，已经堵住了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When she traveled to Prague a second time, it was with a heavy suitcase. She had packed all her things, determined never again to return to the small town. He had invited her to come to his place the following evening. That night, she had slept in a cheap hotel. In the morning, she carried her heavy suitcase to the station, left it there, and roamed the streets of Prague the whole day with Anna Karenina under her arm. Not even after she rang the doorbell and he opened the door would she part with it. It was like a ticket into Tomas's world. She realized that she had nothing but that miserable ticket, and the thought brought her nearly to tears. To keep from crying, she talked too much and too loudly, and she laughed. And again he took her in his arms almost at once and they made love. She had entered a mist in which nothing could be seen and only her scream could be heard.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她第二次再来的时候，提着一个沉沉的箱子，里面塞满了她所有的衣物，她下决心再也不回那个小镇了。他请她第二天晚上去他家，于是她在一个低档的旅馆待了一夜。第二天早上，她把箱子寄存在火车站的行李处，在布拉格的大街上游逛了整整一天，腋下夹着本《安娜·卡列宁娜》。晚上，她按响门铃，他开了门。她一直没有放下那本书，仿佛那就是她迈进托马斯世界的门票。她明白这张可怜的门票是她惟一的通行证，为此，她真忍不住想哭。为了不让自己哭出声来，她不停地大声说话，一边说，一边笑着。而他还是和上次一样，几乎她刚跨进门槛，他就把她拥在怀里，然后他们就做爱。她跌落在一片浓雾里，什么也看不见，什么也听不见，除了她的叫声。">查看中文翻译</div>
