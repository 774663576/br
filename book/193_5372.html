<div class="line_en">The images around him blurred, drifting in and out. Langdon's eyes slowly began to focus. His legs ached, and his body felt like it had been run over by a truck. He was lying on his side on the ground. Something stunk, like bile. He could still hear the incessant sound of lapping water. It no longer sounded peaceful to him. There were other sounds too -- talking close around him. He saw blurry white forms. Were they all wearing white? Langdon decided he was either in an asylum or heaven. From the burning in his throat, Langdon decided it could not be heaven.</div>

<div class="line_en">Langdon felt hands slowly rolling him onto his back. His head swam. He tried to sit up, but the hands gently forced him back down. His body submitted. Then Langdon felt someone going through his pockets, removing items.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登感觉到几隻手缓缓把他翻过来仰躺著。他的头好晕，想坐起身，但那些手温柔地逼他躺回去。他的身体乖乖顺从了。然后兰登感觉到有个人检查他的口袋，拿出东西来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dr. Jacobus felt the pulse of the bedraggled man they had just pulled from the Tiber River. The doctor decided that God himself had hand-delivered this one to safety.

<div class="line_en">Suddenly someone was yelling from the hospital entryway. It was one of the patients. She was screaming, going mad, holding her portable radio to the sky and praising God. Apparently Camerlegno Ventresca had just miraculously appeared on the roof of the Vatican.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="忽然间有人站在医院入口处大喊，是个病患。她疯狂尖叫著，手裡抓著手提收音机朝向天空，讚美上帝。显然凡特雷思卡总司库刚刚奇蹟地出现在梵蒂冈的屋顶上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Impossibile!"Jacobus declared. Robert Langdon was the man from the television -- the American professor who had been helping the Vatican. Jacobus had seen Mr. Langdon, only minutes ago, getting into a helicopter in St. Peter's Square and flying miles up into the air. Jacobus and the others had run out to the dock to witness the antimatter explosion -- a tremendous sphere of light like nothing any of them had ever seen. How could this be the same man!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「不可能！」贾柯布斯说。罗柏．兰登就是电视上那个人──之前协助梵蒂冈的那个美国教授。才几分钟前，贾柯布斯还看到兰登先生爬上圣彼得广场上的那架直升机，往上飞了几哩高。贾柯布斯和其他人还衝到码头上，亲眼看到了反物质爆炸──一个巨大无比的光球，他们这辈子从没见过这种事情。这怎麽可能是同一个人！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's him!" the nurse exclaimed, brushing his soaked hair back. "And I recognize his tweed coat!"</div>

<div class="line_en">Langdon did not feel lucky. He could barely make sense of his own memories… the helicopter… the camerlegno. His body ached everywhere. They gave him some water, and he rinsed out his mouth. They placed a new gauze on his palm.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登可不觉得幸运。他想不太起来发生了什麽事……直升机……总司库。他身上到处都在痛。他们给他一点水，他漱了口。他们又给他的手掌包上乾净的纱布。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="此时兰登才看见他外套衬裡上沾得到处都是的羊皮纸碎片。伽利略《图解》的那张书页。世界上最后仅存的一份，刚刚分解了。他已经麻木得不晓得该作何反应，只是瞪著眼睛看。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"We found it in your pocket. I think you'll need a new one, though." The nurse flipped open the two-inch screen on the back. "Your viewer is cracked." Then she brightened. "The sound still works, though. Barely." She held the device up to her ear. "Keeps playing something over and over." She listened a moment and then scowled, handing it to Langdon. "Two guys arguing, I think."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「我们在你口袋裡找到的。不过我想你得买个新的了。」那个护士把袖珍摄影机背后的两吋萤幕打开。「萤幕摔坏了。」然后她脸色亮了一下。「不过声音还可以播放，勉勉强强。」她把那个仪器举到耳边听。「不断在重复播放。」她听了一会儿，然后脸一沉，递给兰登。「我觉得，好像是两个人在吵架。」">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The nurse frowned and held out the bin. Langdon looked at the contents. Along with his wallet and pen was a tiny Sony RUVI camcorder. He recalled it now. Kohler had handed it to him and asked him to give it to the media.</div>
