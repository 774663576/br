<div class="line_en">Mrs. Dubose lived alone except for a Negro girl in constant attendance, two doors up the street from us in a house with steep front steps and a dog-trot hall. She was very old; she spent most of each day in bed and the rest of it in a wheelchair. It was rumored that she kept a CSA pistol concealed among her numerous shawls and wraps.</div>

<div class="line_en">When we were small, Jem and I confined our activities to the southern neighborhood, but when I was well into the second grade at school and tormenting Boo Radley became passe, the business section of Maycomb drew us frequently up the street past the real property of Mrs. Henry Lafayette Dubose. It was impossible to go to town without passing her house unless we wished to walk a mile out of the way. Previous minor encounters with her left me with no desire for more, but Jem said I had to grow up some time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小时候，我和杰姆的活动范围只限于这个镇的南边一带。但是当我上了二年级，烦扰布—拉德利己成为往事时，我们常常经过亨利·拉斐特·杜博斯太太的房子和土地，来到镇北边的商业区。到镇上去不经过她家是不可能的，除非我们愿意绕道多走一英里路。前几次和她的小冲突使我不想再遇到类似事件，但杰姆说我还得长大一点才能绕道走。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jem and I hated her. If she was on the porch when we passed, we would be raked by her wrathful gaze, subjected to ruthless interrogation regarding our behavior, and given a melancholy prediction on what we would amount to when we grew up, which was always nothing. We had long ago given up the idea of walking past her house on the opposite side of the street; that only made her raise her voice and let the whole neighborhood in on it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我和杰姆都恨她。我们经过她家时，她如果在走廊上，就耍怒气冲冲地瞪着我们，凶恶地问我们干过什么坏事没有，还要令人意气消沉地预言我们长大后会干些什么，当然是说我们毫无出息。我们早就决定不从她家对面的街道上走，因为这一来她反而会把嗓门提高，使得左右邻居都听得到。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She was vicious. Once she heard Jem refer to our father as "Atticus" and her reaction was apoplectic. Besides being the sassiest, most disrespectful mutts who ever passed her way, we were told that it was quite a pity our father had not remarried after our mother's death. A lovelier lady than our mother never lived, she said, and it was heartbreaking the way Atticus Finch let her children run wild. I did not remember our mother, but Jem did -- he would tell me about her sometimes -- and he went livid when Mrs. Dubose shot us this message.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她坏透了。一次她听见杰姆叫“阿迪克斯”，她的反应就好象中风发作似的。她说我们是经过她家门口的人中最粗鲁最无礼的小杂种。除此之外，她还对我们说我妈妈死后，爸爸没再给我们找个妈妈真是太遗憾了。她说比我妈妈更可爱的女人从来没有过，阿迪克斯这样不管教孩子，让我们胡作非为，真叫人伤心。我不记得妈妈了，但杰姆记得——有时他跟我讲起妈妈——杜博斯太太跟我们说这话时，杰姆的脸都气得发青。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jem, having survived Boo Radley, a mad dog and other terrors, had concluded that it was cowardly to stop at Miss Rachel's front steps and wait, and had decreed that we must run as far as the post office corner each evening to meet Atticus coming from work. Countless evenings Atticus would find Jem furious at something Mrs. Dubose had said when we went by.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jem would say she must not be very sick, she hollered so. When the three of us came to her house, Atticus would sweep off his hat, wave gallantly to her and say, "Good evening, Mrs. Dubose! You look like a picture this evening."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰姆通常说她的病肯定不重，是故意叫得那么厉害。我们三个人路过她那儿时，阿迪克斯总是摘下帽子和悦地朝她一挥，嘴里说：“晚上好，杜博斯太太！今天晚上，您看上去象一幅画一样。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I had long had my eye on that baton: it was at V. J. Elmore's, it was bedecked with sequins and tinsel, it cost seventeen cents. It was then my burning ambition to grow up and twirl with the Maycomb County High School band. Having developed my talent to where I could throw up a stick and almost catch it coming down, I had caused Calpurnia to deny me entrance to the house every time she saw me with a stick in my hand. I felt that I could overcome this defect with a real baton, and I thought it generous of Jem to buy one for me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我早就看中那根指挥棒了；是埃尔默商店的，上面装饰着金属片和金属丝，价格一角七分。当时我的野心是长大以后指挥梅科姆县中学的乐队。我常常向上抛棍子，下来时再抓住，我的这个本领越来越娴熟。这一来，每次卡尔珀尼亚看见我手上有棍子就不让我进屋。我觉得如果有根真指挥棒，这个毛病就会改掉的。我想杰姆肯为我买根指挥棒，真是够大方的了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jem was scarlet.

<div class="line_cn" title="杰姆脸色通红。我拉拉他的袖子，一边在人行道上走，一边听到后边传来的恶言恶语，说我们家道德败坏，其大前提是，不管怎么说，芬奇家有一半人有神经病，但如果我们的妈妈还在的话，我们是不会堕落到这种地步的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes indeed, what has this world come to when a Finch goes against his raising? I'll tell you!" She put her hand to her mouth. When she drew it away, it trailed a long silver thread of saliva. "Your father's no better than the niggers and trash he works for!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“真的，芬奇家的人和自己人作对时，人家会得出什么样的结论呢？我告诉你！”她把手放到嘴上，抽开时，手上拖了条长长的白色的唾沫。“你们的爸爸和他为之卖力的那些黑鬼以及其他混蛋是一丘之貉！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I wasn't sure what Jem resented most, but I took umbrage at Mrs. Dubose's assessment of the family's mental hygiene. I had become almost accustomed to hearing insults aimed at Atticus. But this was the first one coming from an adult. Except for her remarks about Atticus, Mrs. Dubose's attack was only routine. There was a hint of summer in the air -- in the shadows it was cool, but the sun was warm, which meant good times coming: no school and Dill.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我不敢肯定杰姆最恨什么，但我最气愤的是杜博斯太太说我们家韵人思想不干净。昕别人侮辱阿迪克斯对我来说己是习以为常了。但这是第一次出自大人之口。除了咒骂阿迪克斯的话外，杜博斯太太对我们的攻击都是老一套。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jem bought his steam engine and we went by Elmore's for my baton. Jem took no pleasure in his acquisition; he jammed it in his pocket and walked silently beside me toward home. On the way home I nearly hit Mr. Link Deas, who said, "Look out now, Scout!" when I missed a toss, and when we approached Mrs. Dubose's house my baton was grimy from having picked it up out of the dirt so many times.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="空气中有夏天的迹象了——在树荫下挺凉快，太阳下却有些热了，这意味着好玩的时候到了：不上学，还有迪尔。杰姆买了蒸汽机后，我们去埃尔默商店买我的指挥棒。杰姆买了蒸汽机，却并不高兴。他把它律口袋里一塞，和我默默地朝家里走去。路上我不停地把指挥棒向上抛，有一次没接到，差点打在林克·迪斯身上。“看着点，斯各特。”他说。等我们走近杜博斯太太家时，我的指挥棒因为多次掉到地上，已经很脏了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">What Jem did was something I'd do as a matter of course had I not been under Atticus's interdict, which I assumed included not fighting horrible old ladies. We had just come to her gate when Jem snatched my baton and ran flailing wildly up the steps into Mrs. Dubose's front yard, forgetting everything Atticus had said, forgetting that she packed a pistol under her shawls, forgetting that if Mrs. Dubose missed, her girl Jessie probably wouldn't.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿迪克斯曾经说过不要和令人讨厌的老太太一般见识，要是没有他的禁令的话，杰姆干的那事我肯定会干。我们刚走到她的大门前，杰姆突然夺过我的指挥棒，猛地冲过台阶，进了杜博斯太太的前院，把阿迪克斯的话都忘了，也忘了杜博斯太太的围巾里有枝枪，忘了假如她打不准，她的女佣人杰西可能会打中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In later years, I sometimes wondered exactly what made Jem do it, what made him break the bonds of "You just be a gentleman, son," and the phase of self-conscious rectitude he had recently entered. Jem had probably stood as much guff about Atticus lawing for niggers as had I, and I took it for granted that he kept his temper -- he had a naturally tranquil disposition and a slow fuse. At the time, however, I thought the only explanation for what he did was that for a few minutes he simply went mad.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们长大以后，我有时候百恩不得其解，不知究竟是什么原因使杰姆当时那么干，使他破侧违反了“傲个有教养韵人”的嘱咐和他刚学会的要自觉地做到为人正直的观点。杰姆受到的对阿迪克斯为黑鬼辩护的非难和我昕到的大概一样多，也一样忍受了。我认为他头脑冷静是理所当然的——他的性格本来就很稳重，不容易大发雷霆。我想对他的举动的唯一解释是，在那几分钟内，他简直发疯了。">查看中文翻译</div>

Her mouth seemed to have a private existence of its own. It worked separate and apart from the rest of her, out and in, like a clam hole at low tide.
