<div class="line_cn" title="很快阿拉丁就有了一件崭新的、价格不菲的外套，他非常高兴。然后他们就开始逛市场，看了很多家商店。他们喝了咖啡，和人们聊天，还吃了一顿丰盛的晚餐。对阿拉丁来说这真是美好的一天。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Abanazar smiled. "But of course," he said. "You are my brother's son. Now, let us leave the city and go up into the hills. There is something wonderful there, and you must see it."</div>

<div class="line_en">At once, the sky went dark. Black smoke came from the fire, and the ground under the fire began to open. Then the smoke went away, and in the ground there was now a big white stone with a ring in it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="天空立刻暗了下来。火堆里冒出黑烟，火底下的地面裂开了。黑烟散尽后，地面上出现了一块白色的巨石，上面还有一个环。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="阿拉丁四下里看了看，但山里没有任何花园的影子。“花园在哪儿呢，叔叔？”他问道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Aladdin did not understand, but he made a fire for his uncle on the ground. Then Abanazar took some powder out of a small box, and put it on the fire. He closed his eyes and said, "Abracadabra!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿拉丁不明白这是什么意思，但还是为叔叔在地上生了一堆火。然后阿巴那扎尔从一个小盒子里拿出一些药粉撒在火里，闭上眼睛念念有词道：“阿不拉卡达不拉！”">查看中文翻译</div>

Now, listen carefully." He took Aladdin's hand. "Only you can move this stone. Put your hand on the ring and say your name and your father's name."</div>

<div class="line_en">Very afraid, Aladdin put his hand on the ring. It was not hot, but very cold. "I am Aladdin, son of Mustafa," he said. The stone moved easily, and now Aladdin could see stairs under the ground.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿拉丁战战兢兢地抓住那个环。环一点也不热，倒是非常冰冷。“我是阿拉丁，穆斯塔法的儿子。”他说道。巨石很轻易地被移开了，阿拉丁看到地下有一道台阶。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Go down those stairs," Abanazar said, "and then through four big rooms. In the last room there is a door into a garden, and under one of the trees there is a lamp. You can take some fruit from the trees, but first you must find the lamp. Bring the lamp to me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“沿着那些台阶走下去，”阿巴那扎尔说，“穿过四个大屋子。在最后一个房间里有一扇门通向一个花园，园里的一棵树下有一盏油灯。你可以从那些树上摘一些果子，但你必须先找到那盏油灯，并把它带给我。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No. Only you can do this, my boy." Abanazar took a gold ring off his finger and gave it to Aladdin. "This ring is magic and can protect you," he said. "Be careful, and bring me the lamp quickly!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不行，只有你能做到这个，我的孩子。”阿巴那扎尔从手上摘下一枚金戒指交给阿拉丁，“这枚戒指具有魔力，能够保护你，”他说，“小心点儿，尽快把灯带给我。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Aladdin put the ring on the little finger of his left hand and began to go down the stairs. It was dark and he was afraid, but he was more afraid of Abanazar.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿拉丁把戒指戴在左手的小指上，沿着台阶走了下去。里面很黑，他很害怕，但他更害怕阿巴那扎尔。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And Aladdin was right to be afraid, because Abanazar was not his uncle. He was a magician from Morocco, and he wanted this lamp very much. It was a magic lamp, and only a poor boy from the city could get it for him -- a boy called Aladdin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿拉丁感到害怕是对的，因为阿巴那扎尔并不是他的叔叔。他是一个来自摩洛哥的魔法师，他非常想得到那盏灯。那是一盏神灯，只有这座城市里一个叫阿拉丁的穷孩子才能为他拿到。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Aladdin went down a hundred stairs and into the first room. Down here, it was not dark and he went quickly through the rooms to the door into the garden. There were trees in the garden, with beautiful fruit of different colours -- white, red, green, and yellow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿拉丁下了100级台阶来到第一间屋子里。里面并不暗，他很快穿过那些屋子走进了花园。花园里有很多树，树上满是五颜六色的美丽果子——有白的、红的、绿的，还有黄的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He soon found the lamp, under one of the trees. "Why does my uncle want this dirty old lamp?" he thought. He put it in his pocket. Then he began to take fruit from the trees, and to put it in every pocket of his coat. After that he went back to the stairs and began to go up. Soon he could see Abanazar and the blue sky.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他很快就在其中的一棵树下找到了那盏灯。“为什么我叔叔想要这盏脏兮兮的破油灯呢？”他寻思。他把它装进口袋里，然后开始从树上摘果子，直到装满了衣服上的每个口袋。之后他返回到台阶那里开始向上爬。他很快就看到了阿巴那扎尔和蓝色的天空。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Give the lamp to me," Abanazar said, and put out his hand. "Quickly, boy, the lamp!"</div>

<div class="line_en">"You good-for-nothing! You dog! You and the lamp can stay down there!" Angrily, Abanazar ran to the fire and put more powder on it. "Abracadabra!" he called.</div>
