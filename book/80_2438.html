<div class="line_en">These embarrassments that the Quakers suffer'd from having establish'd and published it as one of their principles that no kind of war was lawful, and which, being once published, they could not afterwards, however they might change their minds, easily get rid of, reminds me of what I think a more prudent conduct in another sect among us, that of the Dunkers. I was acquainted with one of its founders, Michael Welfare, soon after it appear'd. He complain'd to me that they were grievously calumniated by the zealots of other persuasions, and charg'd with abominable principles and practices, to which they were utter strangers. I told him this had always been the case with new sects, and that, to put a stop to such abuse, I imagin'd it might be well to publish the articles of their belief, and the rules of their discipline. He said that it had been propos'd among them, but not agreed to, for this reason: "When we were first drawn together as a society," says he, "it had pleased God to enlighten our minds so far as to see that some doctrines, which we once esteemed truths, were errors; and that others, which we had esteemed errors, were real truths. From time to time He has been pleased to afford us farther light, and our principles have been improving, and our errors diminishing. Now we are not sure that we are arrived at the end of this progression, and at the perfection of spiritual or theological knowledge; and we fear that, if we should once print our confession of faith, we should feel ourselves as if bound and confin'd by it, and perhaps be unwilling to receive farther improvement, and our successors still more so, as conceiving what we their elders and founders had done, to be something sacred, never to be departed from."</div>

<div class="line_en">This modesty in a sect is perhaps a singular instance in the history of mankind, every other sect supposing itself in possession of all truth, and that those who differ are so far in the wrong; like a man traveling in foggy weather, those at some distance before him on the road he sees wrapped up in the fog, as well as those behind him, and also the people in the fields on each side, but near him all appears clear, tho' in truth he is as much in the fog as any of them. To avoid this kind of embarrassment, the Quakers have of late years been gradually declining the public service in the Assembly and in the magistracy, choosing rather to quit their power than their principle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个教派这样谦逊恐怕是人类历史上绝无仅有的吧！其他教派总是以为自己获得了全部真理，认为持有不同见解的人是完全错误的。像一个人在大雾弥漫的时候行路，在他前面远处的人他看去好像完全沉浸在大雾中，在他后面和在两边田野里的人也是如此，但在他近旁的一切好像很清晰，实际上他跟其他人一样都在大雾中。为了避免这种进退维谷的窘境，近年以来越来越多的教友会教友辞去了州议会和政府中的职位，宁可放弃他们的权力，而不愿在原则上妥协。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In order of time, I should have mentioned before, that having, in 1742, invented an open stove for the better warming of rooms, and at the same time saving fuel, as the fresh air admitted was warmed in entering, I made a present of the model to Mr. Robert Grace, one of my early friends, who, having an iron-furnace, found the casting of the plates for these stoves a profitable thing, as they were growing in demand. To promote that demand, I wrote and published a pamphlet, entitled "An Account of the new-invented Pennsylvania Fireplaces; wherein their Construction and Manner of Operation is particularly explained; their Advantages above every other Method of warming Rooms demonstrated; and all Objections that have been raised against the Use of them answered and obviated," etc. This pamphlet had a good effect. Gov'r. Thomas was so pleas'd with the construction of this stove, as described in it, that he offered to give me a patent for the sole vending of them for a term of years; but I declin'd it from a principle which has ever weighed with me on such occasions, viz., That, as we enjoy great advantages from the inventions of others, we should be glad of an opportunity to serve others by any invention of ours; and this we should do freely and generously.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="照时间的先后来讲，我老早就应当提起下面这件事了。在一七四二年我发明了一种“开炉”，这种火炉能够更好地使房间变暖，同时能节省燃料，因为冷空气在进炉时就烘热了。以后我就制造了一个模型送给我的一个老朋友劳勃脱·葛莱丝。他开设一家翻砂厂，他发现制造这种火炉的铁板获利很厚，因为买这种火炉的人越来越多了。为了推广销路，我编写和发表了一本小册子，定名为《新发明宾夕法尼亚火炉说明书：本文特别说明它的构造和使用方法，证明它较其他取暖方法的优点，驳斥一切反对使用这种火炉的议论》。这本小册子发行后效果良好，汤麦斯州长非常喜欢书中所介绍的这种火炉的结构，他甚至提议在若干年内给我专卖权，但是我不想取得专利权，因为在这个问题上我心里一向有着这样一个原则：既然别人的发明给了我们巨大的便利，我们也应该乐于让别人利用我们的发明，并且我们应当无偿地慷慨地把我们的发明贡献给他人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Peace being concluded, and the association business therefore at an end, I turn'd my thoughts again to the affair of establishing an academy. The first step I took was to associate in the design a number of active friends, of whom the Junto furnished a good part; the next was to write and publish a pamphlet, entitled Proposals Relating to the Education of Youth in Pennsylvania. This I distributed among the principal inhabitants gratis; and as soon as I could suppose their minds a little prepared by the perusal of it, I set on foot a subscription for opening and supporting an academy; it was to be paid in quotas yearly for five years; by so dividing it, I judg'd the subscription might be larger, and I believe it was so, amounting to no less, if I remember right, than five thousand pounds.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="战争结束了，因此团练的工作也完了，我的思想又一次转到开办学院这件事上去了。我第一步是邀请我朋友中的一些积极分子参加这个计划，其中有相当数量是密社的社员；第二步是编写和发表一本小册子，叫做《有关宾夕法尼亚青年教育的建议》。我把它们免费赠送给居民中有地位的人，过了一些时候我认为他们已经读过这本小册子，因而在思想上有了一些准备时，我就为开办和维持这所学院开始募捐。捐款在五年内分五次缴纳。这种分期缴款办法，我认为可以使得认捐数大一些。事实上我相信也是如此，假如我没有记错的话，认捐总数不下五千镑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">An ironmonger in London however, assuming a good deal of my pamphlet, and working it up into his own, and making some small changes in the machine, which rather hurt its operation, got a patent for it there, and made, as I was told, a little fortune by it. And this is not the only instance of patents taken out for my inventions by thers, tho' not always with the same success, which I never contested, as having no desire of profiting by patents myself, and hating disputes. The use of these fireplaces in very many houses, both of this and the neighbouring colonies, has been, and is, a great saving of wood to the inhabitants.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，伦敦的一个铁器商人从我的小册子里窃取了许多东西，把它改装成他自己的东西，做了一些小的更动，这些变动只是减低了火炉的效力，就在伦敦取得专利，据说，他倒因此而发了一笔小小的横财哩。别人从我的发明中僭窃我的专利权不限于这一个例子，虽然有时候他们也不一定同样地获得成功，但是我从不跟他们争讼，因为我自己无意利用专卖权来获利，同时我也不喜欢争吵。这种火炉广泛推行，不管是在宾州或在附近的殖民地里，给居民节约了大量的柴火。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It is to be noted that the contributions to this building being made by people of different sects, care was taken in the nomination of trustees, in whom the building and ground was to be vested, that a predominancy should not be given to any sect, lest in time that predominancy might be a means of appropriating the whole to the use of such sect, contrary to the original intention. It was therefore that one of each sect was appointed, viz., one Church-of-England man, one Presbyterian, one Baptist, one Moravian, etc., those, in case of vacancy by death, were to fill it by election from among the contributors. The Moravian happen'd not to please his colleagues, and on his death they resolved to have no other of that sect. The difficulty then was, how to avoid having two of some other sect, by means of the new choice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们记得这所大会堂是由许多不同教派的人出资修建起来的，所以在推选保管该项房地产的理事时，他们不许任何教派占有优势，免得以后有人利用这种优势，违反修建这所会堂的原意，把整所房屋拨给某一教派独用。因此他们从每一教派中推选一人为理事，就是说，圣公会一人，长老会一人，浸礼会一人，弟兄派一人，等等。如果因死亡而有空额时，由理事会就捐款人中推选一人填补之。碰巧这位弟兄派理事与其他理事不和，在他死后理事会决定不再选弟兄派的人做理事了。但是问题是在选举新理事时怎样才能避免一个教派有两个理事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Several persons were named, and for that reason not agreed to. At length one mention'd me, with the observation that I was merely an honest man, and of no sect at all, which prevail'd with them to chuse me. The enthusiasm which existed when the house was built had long since abated, and its trustees had not been able to procure fresh contributions for paying the ground-rent, and discharging some other debts the building had occasion'd, which embarrass'd them greatly. Being now a member of both setts of trustees, that for the building and that for the Academy, I had a good opportunity of negotiating with both, and brought them finally to an agreement, by which the trustees for the building were to cede it to those of the academy, the latter undertaking to discharge the debt, to keep for ever open in the building a large hall for occasional preachers, according to the original intention, and maintain a free- school for the instruction of poor children. Writings were accordingly drawn, and on paying the debts the trustees of the academy were put in possession of the premises; and by dividing the great and lofty hall into stories, and different rooms above and below for the several schools, and purchasing some additional ground, the whole was soon made fit for our purpose, and the scholars remov'd into the building. The care and trouble of agreeing with the workmen, purchasing materials, and superintending the work, fell upon me; and I went thro' it the more cheerfully, as it did not then interfere with my private business, having the year before taken a very able, industrious, and honest partner, Mr. David Hall, with whose character I was well acquainted, as he had work'd for me four years. He took off my hands all care of the printing-office, paying me punctually my share of the profits. This partnership continued eighteen years, successfully for us both.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="理事们提出了几个候选人的名字，但是为了上述的理由未能通过，终于有一个理事提出我的名字，他说我仅仅是一个诚实人，不属于任何教派，这一下可说服了其他理事，使他们推选了我。当年修建会堂时的那股热情老早就烟消云散了，理事会无法觅得新的捐款来付偿地租和其他与会堂有关的债务，因此感到十分为难。现在我是两个理事会的理事了，是会堂的理事，也是学院的理事，因此我有一个很好的机会跟两方面商谈，最后使双方达成了一项协议。按照这项协议，会堂理事会把会堂让渡给学院理事会，后者承担付偿债务的责任，应允遵照修建该堂的原意永远在会堂里划出一大间听任传教士们的不时之需，并开办一所免费教育清寒子弟的学校。于是双方订了合同，学院理事会付清了债以后，就接管了房产。我们把这高大的会堂分成两层，每层又隔成若干房间作为讲堂。我们另外又买了一些地，整个场所不久就符合我们的需要了。学员们就搬进了这所大楼。所有跟工人订合同、采购物资和监督工程等工作都落在我的肩上，但是我倒还是很乐意地担任这些工作的，特别是因为它们并不妨害我自己的业务，因为一年前我已经跟一个十分能干、勤勉和诚实的伙友大卫·荷尔先生合了伙。他以前替我做了四年工，所以我很了解他的性格。他负担了管理印刷铺的一切工作，使我得以脱身，他按时付给我应得的红利。这一合伙维持了十八年之久，对双方都大有裨益。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The trustees of the academy, after a while, were incorporated by a charter from the governor; their funds were increas'd by contributions in Britain and grants of land from the proprietaries, to which the Assembly has since made considerable addition; and thus was established the present University of Philadelphia. I have been continued one of its trustees from the beginning, now near forty years, and have had the very great pleasure of seeing a number of the youth who have receiv'd their education in it, distinguish'd by their improv'd abilities, serviceable in public stations and ornaments to their country.</div>

I purchased all Dr. Spence's apparatus, who had come from England to lecture here, and I proceeded in my electrical experiments with great alacrity; but the publick, now considering me as a man of leisure, laid hold of me for their purposes, every part of our civil government, and almost at the same time, imposing some duty upon me. The governor put me into the commission of the peace; the corporation of the city chose me of the common council, and soon after an alderman; and the citizens at large chose me a burgess to represent them in Assembly. This latter station was the more agreeable to me, as I was at length tired with sitting there to hear debates, in which, as clerk, I could take no part, and which were often so unentertaining that I was induc'd to amuse myself with making magic squares or circles, or any thing to avoid weariness; and I conceiv'd my becoming a member would enlarge my power of doing good. I would not, however, insinuate that my ambition was not flatter'd by all these promotions; it certainly was; for, considering my low beginning, they were great things to me; and they were still more pleasing, as being so many spontaneous testimonies of the public good opinion, and by me entirely unsolicited.</div>

They promis'd this, and they kept their promise, because they could get no liquor, and the treaty was conducted very orderly, and concluded to mutual satisfaction. They then claim'd and receiv'd the rum; this was in the afternoon; they were near one hundred men, women, and children, and were lodg'd in temporary cabins, built in the form of a square, just without the town. In the evening, hearing a great noise among them, the commissioners walk'd out to see what was the matter. We found they had made a great bonfire in the middle of the square; they were all drunk, men and women, quarreling and fighting. Their darkcolour'd bodies, half naked, seen only by the gloomy light of the bonfire, running after and beating one another with firebrands, accompanied by their horrid yellings, form'd a scene the most resembling our ideas of hell that could well be imagin'd; there was no appeasing the tumult, and we retired to our lodging.

<div class="line_cn" title="第二天，他们发觉他们错了，他们不该打搅我们，所以派了他们的三个酋长来道歉。发言人承认了错误，但是把错误推到甜酒身上，接着他就设法宽宥甜酒，他说：“创造万物的大神使得物各有其用，既然神指定某种东西有某一用途，不管这用途是什么，那东西就应当按着这用途来使用。当神创造甜酒时，神说：‘这酒是给印第安人喝醉用的’，所以我们必须执行神的旨意。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And, indeed, if it be the design of Providence to extirpate these savages in order to make room for cultivators of the earth, it seems not improbable that rum may be the appointed means. It has already annihilated all the tribes who formerly inhabited the sea-coast.</div>

<div class="line_en">In 1751, Dr. Thomas Bond, a particular friend of mine, conceived the idea of establishing a hospital in Philadelphia (a very beneficent design, which has been ascrib'd to me, but was originally his), for the reception and cure of poor sick persons, whether inhabitants of the province or strangers. He was zealous and active in endeavouring to procure subscriptions for it, but the proposal being a novelty in America, and at first not well understood, he met with but small success.</div>

<div class="line_en">The subscriptions afterwards were more free and generous; but, beginning to flag, I saw they would be insufficient without some assistance from the Assembly, and therefore propos'd to petition for it, which was done. The country members did not at first relish the project; they objected that it could only be serviceable to the city, and therefore the citizens alone should be at the expense of it; and they doubted whether the citizens themselves generally approv'd of it. My allegation on the contrary, that it met with such approbation as to leave no doubt of our being able to raise two thousand pounds by voluntary donations, they considered as a most extravagant supposition, and utterly impossible.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="以后人们的捐款就比前踊跃了。但是不久捐款就越来越少了，我知道州议会若不加以援助，光靠捐款是不够的。因此我主张申请州议会津贴，接着我们就这样做了。代表乡村的议员们起初并不喜欢这个计划，他们表示异议说，这个医院只对城里人有益，因此应当完全由城里的市民出资来开办。同时他们也怀疑究竟多数市民自己是否赞成这个计划。和他们的意见正相反，我认为它受到市民普遍的欢迎，毫无疑问我们能够募得两千镑的捐款。他们认为我的想法是一种过高的奢望，是完全不能兑现的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At length he came to me with the compliment that he found there was no such thing as carrying a public-spirited project through without my being concern'd in it. "For," says he, "I am often ask'd by those to whom I propose subscribing, Have you consulted Franklin upon this business? And what does he think of it? And when I tell them that I have not (supposing it rather out of your line), they do not subscribe, but say they will consider of it." I enquired into the nature and probable utility of his scheme, and receiving from him a very satisfactory explanation, I not only subscrib'd to it myself, but engag'd heartily in the design of procuring subscriptions from others. Previously, however, to the solicitation, I endeavoured to prepare the minds of the people by writing on the subject in the newspapers, which was my usual custom in such cases, but which he had omitted.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was about this time that another projector, the Rev. Gilbert Tennent, came to me with a request that I would assist him in procuring a subscription for erecting a new meeting-house. It was to he for the use of a congregation he had gathered among the Presbyterians, who were originally disciples of Mr. Whitefield. Unwilling to make myself disagreeable to my fellow-citizens by too frequently soliciting their contributions, I absolutely refus'd. He then desired I would furnish him with a list of the names of persons I knew by experience to be generous and public-spirited. I thought it would be unbecoming in me, after their kind compliance with my solicitations, to mark them out to be worried by other beggars, and therefore refus'd also to give such a list. He then desir'd I would at least give him my advice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="约在这时候，另外一个发起人，吉尔柏特·檀南特牧师，来看我，要求我帮助他募捐兴建一所新的教堂。这所教堂将归他手下的长老会教友使用，他们原先是胡飞特先生的信徒。我坚决地拒绝了他的请求，因为我不愿意过分频繁地向市民们募捐，致使他们对我不满。以后他要我提供给他一张名单，列举从经验中我认为是慷慨好赐、热心公益的人的姓名。我想在他们同情地答应了我的请求，捐了款以后，假如我倒反把他们指出来使他们受其他募捐人员的纠缠，那我就太不讲道理了。所以我也拒绝给他这样的名单。后来他要求我至少给他一些忠告。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This condition carried the bill through; for the members, who had oppos'd the grant, and now conceiv'd they might have the credit of being charitable without the expence, agreed to its passage; and then, in soliciting subscriptions among the people, we urg'd the conditional promise of the law as an additional motive to give, since every man's donation would be doubled; thus the clause work'd both ways. The subscriptions accordingly soon exceeded the requisite sum, and we claim'd and receiv'd the public gift, which enabled us to carry the design into execution. A convenient and handsome building was soon erected; the institution has by constant experience been found useful, and flourishes to this day; and I do not remember any of my political manoeuvres, the success of which gave me at the time more pleasure, or wherein, after thinking of it, I more easily excus'd myself for having made some use of cunning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一条件使得该议案获得通过，因为原先反对拨款的议员现在认为他们可以不费分文地获得慈善家的美名，他们就赞成这议案。以后，在向人募捐时，我们强调该议案中的有条件的诺言，使人更乐于捐助，因为每人的捐款将变成双倍。这样这个附带条件在两方面都起了作用。因此捐款总数不久就超过了规定的必需数目，我们提出要求并获得了政府津贴，这就帮助了我们实现这一计划。不久我们建造了一所适宜而又美观的大楼。长期的经验证明这一医院是有益的，直到今日它还很兴旺。在我毕生的政治策划中，没有一桩事情的成功，照我记忆所及，在当时给我这么多的快慰，或是在事后当我想起时，能够如此容易地使我宽宥我自己曾经施行了一个小小的策略。">查看中文翻译</div>
