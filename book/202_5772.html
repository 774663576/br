<div class="line_en">The two men appeared out of nowhere, a few yards apart in the narrow, moonlit lane. For a second they stood quite still, wands directed at each other's chests; then, recognizing each other, they stowed their wands beneath their cloaks and started walking briskly in the same direction.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两个男人从虚空中突然现身，在月光映照的窄巷里相隔几米。他们一动不动地站立了一秒钟，用魔杖指着对方的胸口。接着，两人互相认了出来，便把魔杖塞进斗篷下面，朝同一方向快步走去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“有消息吗？”个子高一些的那人问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The best," replied Severus Snape.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“再好不过了。”西弗勒斯·斯内普回答。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The lane was bordered on the left by wild, low-growing brambles, on the right by a high, neatly manicured hedge. The men's long cloaks flapped around their ankles as they marched.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小巷的左边是胡乱生长的低矮的荆棘丛，右边是修剪得整整齐齐的高高的树篱。两人大步行走，长长的斗篷拍打着他们的脚踝。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Thought I might be late," said Yaxley, his blunt features sliding in and out of sight as the branches of overhanging trees broke the moonlight. "It was a little trickier than I expected. But I hope he will be satisfied. You sound confident that your reception will be good?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我还以为迟到了呢。”亚克斯利说道，头顶上低悬的树枝不时地遮挡住月光，他愚钝的五官显得忽明忽暗，“没想到事情会这么棘手，不过我希望他会满意。听你的口气，你好像相信自己会受到欢迎？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Snape nodded, but did not elaborate. They turned right, into a wide driveway that led off the lane. The high hedge curved with them, running off into the distance beyond the pair of impressive wrought-iron gates barring the men's way. Neither of them broke step: In silence both raised their left arms in a kind of salute and passed straight through, as though the dark metal were smoke.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯内普点点头，但没有细说。他们往右一转，离开小巷，进入一条宽宽的汽车道。高高的树篱也跟着拐了个弯，向远处延伸，两扇气派非凡的锻铁大门挡住了两人的去路。他们谁也没有停住脚步，而是像行礼一样默默地抬起左臂，径直穿了过去，就好像那黑色的锻铁不过是烟雾一般。">查看中文翻译</div>

</div>
<div class="line_en">The yew hedges muffled the sound of the men's footsteps. There was a rustle somewhere to their right: Yaxley drew his wand again, pointing it over his companion's head, but the source of the noise proved to be nothing more than a pure-white peacock, strutting majestically along the top of the hedge.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="紫杉树篱使两人的脚步声听上去发闷。右边什么地方传来沙沙的响声，亚克斯利又抽出魔杖，举过同伴的头顶，结果发现弄出声音的是一只白孔雀，在树篱顶上仪态万方地走着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He always did himself well, Lucius. Peacocks…" Yaxley thrust his wand back under his cloak with a snort.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这个卢修斯，总是搞得这么讲究，孔雀……”亚克斯利哼了一声，把魔杖塞回斗篷下面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A handsome manor house grew out of the darkness at the end of the straight drive, lights glinting in the diamond-paned downstairs windows. Somewhere in the dark garden beyond the hedge a fountain was playing. Gravel crackled beneath their feet as Snape and Yaxley sped toward the front door, which swung inward at their approach, though nobody had visibly opened it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="笔直的车道尽头，一幢非常体面的宅邸赫然出现在黑暗中，底层窗户的菱形玻璃射出闪亮的灯光。在树篱后面黑黢黢的花园里，什么地方有个喷泉在喷水。斯内普和亚克斯利吱嘎吱嘎地踩着砂砾路朝正门走去，刚走到跟前，不见有人开门，门却自动朝里打开了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The hallway was large, dimly lit, and sumptuously decorated, with a magnificent carpet covering most of the stone floor. The eyes of the pale-faced portraits on the walls followed Snape and Yaxley as they strode past. The two men halted at a heavy wooden door leading into the next room, hesitated for the space of a heartbeat, then Snape turned the bronze handle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="门厅很大，光线昏暗，布置得十分豪华，一条华贵的地毯几乎覆盖了整个石头地面。斯内普和亚克斯利大步走过时，墙上那些脸色苍白的肖像用目光跟随着他们。两人在一扇通向另一房间的沉重的木门前停下脚步，迟疑了一下，斯内普转动了青铜把手。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The drawing room was full of silent people, sitting at a long and ornate table. The room's usual furniture had been pushed carelessly up against the walls. Illumination came from a roaring fire beneath a handsome marble mantelpiece surmounted by a gilded mirror. Snape and Yaxley lingered for a moment on the threshold. As their eyes grew accustomed to the lack of light, they were drawn upward to the strangest feature of the scene: an apparently unconscious human figure hanging upside down over the table, revolving slowly as if suspended by an invisible rope, and reflected in the mirror and in the bare, polished surface of the table below. None of the people seated underneath this singular sight was looking at it except for a pale young man sitting almost directly below it. He seemed unable to prevent himself from glancing upward every minute or so.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="客厅里满是沉默不语的人，都坐在一张装潢考究的长桌旁边。房间里平常用的家具被胡乱地推到墙边。华丽的大理石壁炉里燃着熊熊旺火，火光照着屋子，壁炉上方是一面镀金的镜子。斯内普和亚克斯利在门口停留了一会儿，等适应了昏暗的光线后，他们的目光被长桌上方一幕最奇怪的景象吸引住了：一具神志似乎不清的人体头朝下悬在桌子上方，像是被一根无形的绳子吊着，慢慢旋转，身影映在镜子里，映在空荡荡的、擦得铮亮的桌面上。在座的那些人谁也没去看这幕奇异的景象，只有一个差不多正好位于它下方的脸色惨白的年轻人除外。他似乎无法克制自己，不时地往上扫一眼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yaxley. Snape," said a high, clear voice from the head of the table. "You are very nearly late."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“亚克斯利，斯内普，”桌首响起一个高亢、清晰的声音，“你们差点就迟到了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The speaker was seated directly in front of the fireplace, so that it was difficult, at first, for the new arrivals to make out more than his silhouette. As they drew nearer, however, his face shone through the gloom, hairless, snakelike, with slits for nostrils and gleaming red eyes whose pupils were vertical. He was so pale that he seemed to emit a pearly glow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说话的人坐在壁炉正前方，亚克斯利和斯内普一开始只能隐约分辨出他的轮廓。等他们走近了，那人的脸才从阴影里闪现出来：没有头发，像蛇一样，两道细长的鼻孔，一双闪闪发亮的红眼睛，瞳孔是垂直的。他的肤色十分苍白，似乎发出一种珍珠般的光。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="桌旁的人明显地来了兴趣：有的挺直了身子，有的好像坐不住了，都用眼睛盯着斯内普和伏地魔。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Saturday… at nightfall," repeated Voldemort. His red eyes fastened upon Snape's black ones with such intensity that some of the watchers looked away, apparently fearful that they themselves would be scorched by the ferocity of the gaze. Snape, however, looked calmly back into Voldemort's face and, after a moment or two, Voldemort's lipless mouth curved into something like a smile.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“星期六……傍晚。”伏地魔重复了一句。他的红眼睛死死盯着斯内普的黑眼睛，目光如此锐利，旁边的几个人赶紧望向别处，似乎担心那凶残的目光会灼伤自己。斯内普却不动声色地望着伏地魔的脸，片刻之后，伏地魔那没有唇的嘴扭曲成一个古怪的笑容。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“主人，我听到不同的情报。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yaxley waited, but Voldemort did not speak, so he went on, "Dawlish, the Auror, let slip that Potter will not be moved until the thirtieth, the night before the boy turns seventeen."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="亚克斯利等了等，但伏地魔没有说话，他继续往下说道：“德力士，就是那个傲罗，据他透露，波特要到30号，也就是他满17岁前的那个晚上才转移呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="斯内普微微一笑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我向您保证，主人，德力士看上去很有把握。”亚克斯利说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"If he has been Confunded, naturally he is certain," said Snape. "I assure you, Yaxley, the Auror Office will play no further part in the protection of Harry Potter. The Order believes that we have infiltrated the Ministry."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“如果中了混淆咒，他自然很有把握，”斯内普说，“我向你保证，亚克斯利，傲罗办公室在掩护哈利·波特的行动中将不再起任何作用。凤凰社相信我们的人已经打入魔法部。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The Order's got one thing right, then, eh?" said a squat man sitting a short distance from Yaxley; he gave a wheezy giggle that was echoed here and there along the table.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“接下来他们打算把那男孩藏在哪儿？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"At the home of one of the Order," said Snape. "The place, according to the source, has been given every protection that the Order and Ministry together could provide. I think that there is little chance of taking him once he is there, my Lord, unless, of course, the Ministry has fallen before next Saturday, which might give us the opportunity to discover and undo enough of the enchantments to break through the rest."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“藏在某个凤凰社成员的家里。”斯内普说，“据情报说，那个地方已经采取了凤凰社和魔法部所能提供的各种保护措施。我认为，一旦他到了那里，就很难有机会抓住他了。当然啦，除非魔法部在下个星期六之前垮台，主人，那样我们或许有机会发现和解除一些魔咒，继而突破其他魔咒。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, Yaxley?" Voldemort called down the table, the firelight glinting strangely in his red eyes. "Will the Ministry have fallen by next Saturday?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Many of those sitting around Yaxley looked impressed; his neighbor, Dolohov, a man with a long, twisted face, clapped him on the back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="亚克斯利周围的许多人露出钦佩的神情。坐在他旁边的多洛霍夫——一个长着一张扭曲的长脸的男人，拍了拍他的后背。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It is a start," said Voldemort. "But Thicknesse is only one man. SCRImgeour must be surrounded by our people before I act. One failed attempt on the Minister's life will set me back a long way."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这倒令人吃惊，”伏地魔说道，“但辛克尼斯只是一个人。在我们行动之前，斯克林杰周围必须全是我们的人。暗杀部长的努力一旦失败，我们就会前功尽弃。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes -- my Lord, that is true -- but you know, as Head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, Thicknesse has regular contact not only with the Minister himself, but also with the Heads of all the other Ministry departments. It will, I think, be easy now that we have such a high-ranking official under our control, to subjugate the others, and then they can all work together to bring SCRImgeour down."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的——主人，的确如此——可是您知道，辛克尼斯是魔法法律执行司的司长，他不仅与部长本人，而且与魔法部各司的司长都有频繁接触。我想，我们要是把这样一位高级官员控制住了，再制服别人就容易了，然后他们可以一起努力，把斯克林杰赶下台去。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"As long as our friend Thicknesse is not discovered before he has converted the rest," said Voldemort. "At any rate, it remains unlikely that the Ministry will be mine before next Saturday. If we cannot touch the boy at his destination, then it must be done while he travels."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但愿我们的朋友辛克尼斯在改造别人前不要暴露身份，”伏地魔说，“不管怎样，魔法部是不可能在下个星期六之前垮台的。既然不能在那男孩到达目的地以后抓他，我们就必须趁他在路上的时候动手。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We are at an advantage there, my Lord," said Yaxley, who seemed determined to receive some portion of approval. "We now have several people planted within the Department of Magical Transport. If Potter Apparates or uses the Floo Network, we shall know immediately."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“主人，这方面我们有一个优势，”亚克斯利说，他似乎打定主意要得到一些夸奖，“我们已经在魔法交通司里安插了几个人。如果波特幻影移形或使用飞路网，我们立刻就会知道。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The company around the table watched Voldemort apprehensively, each of them, by his or her expression, afraid that they might be blamed for Harry Potter's continued existence.

<div class="line_cn" title="伏地魔的话音刚落，突然传来一声痛苦的哀号，拖得长长的，凄惨无比，像是在回答他的话。桌旁的许多人都大惊失色地往下看去，因为那声音似乎是从他们脚下发出来的。">查看中文翻译</div>
