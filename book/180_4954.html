<div class="line_en">Thinking no harm, for the family would not come, never again, some said, and the house would be sold at Michaelmas perhaps, Mrs McNab stooped and picked a bunch of flowers to take home with her. She laid them on the table while she dusted. She was fond of flowers. It was a pity to let them waste. Suppose the house were sold (she stood arms akimbo in front of the looking-glass) it would want seeing to -- it would. There it had stood all these years without a soul in it. The books and things were mouldy, for, what with the war and help being hard to get, the house had not been cleaned as she could have wished. It was beyond one person's strength to get it straight now. She was too old. Her legs pained her. All those books needed to be laid out on the grass in the sun; there was plaster fallen in the hall; the rain-pipe had blocked over the study quite. But people should come themselves; they should have sent somebody down to see. For there were clothes in the cupboards; they had left clothes in all the bedrooms. What was she to do with them? They had the moth in them -- Mrs Ramsay's things. Poor lady! She would never want THEM again. She was dead, they said; years ago, in London. There was the old grey cloak she wore gardening (Mrs McNab fingered it). She could see her, as she came up the drive with the washing, stooping over her flowers (the garden was a pitiful sight now, all run to riot, and rabbits scuttling at you out of the beds)-- she could see her with one of the children by her in that grey cloak. There were boots and shoes; and a brush and comb left on the dressing-table, for all the world as if she expected to come back tomorrow. (She had died very sudden at the end, they said.) And once they had been coming, but had put off coming, what with the war, and travel being so difficult these days; they had never come all these years; just sent her money; but never wrote, never came, and expected to find things as they had left them, ah, dear! Why the dressing-table drawers were full of things (she pulled them open), handkerchiefs, bits of ribbon. Yes, she could see Mrs Ramsay as she came up the drive with the washing.</div>

<div class="line_en">She had a pleasant way with her. The girls all liked her. But, dear, many things had changed since then (she shut the drawer); many families had lost their dearest. So she was dead; and Mr Andrew killed; and Miss Prue dead too, they said, with her first baby; but everyone had lost some one these years. Prices had gone up shamefully, and didn't come down again neither. She could well remember her in her grey cloak.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她待人一向亲切和蔼。女仆们都喜欢她：可是天哪，从那时以来，发生了多少变化啊（她关上了抽屉）；许多家庭失去了亲人。她死了；安德鲁先生牺牲了；普鲁小姐也死了，他们说是生第一个孩子时死的；不过这些年里大家都失去了亲人。物价厚颜无耻地飞涨，而且从不回落。她能很清楚地记得她穿着灰斗篷时的样子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Good-evening, Mrs McNab," she said, and told cook to keep a plate of milk soup for her -- quite thought she wanted it, carrying that heavy basket all the way up from town. She could see her now, stooping over her flowers; and faint and flickering, like a yellow beam or the circle at the end of a telescope, a lady in a grey cloak, stooping over her flowers, went wandering over the bedroom wall, up the dressing-table, across the wash-stand, as Mrs McNab hobbled and ambled, dusting, straightening. And cook's name now? Mildred? Marian?-- some name like that. Ah, she had forgotten -- she did forget things. Fiery, like all red-haired women. Many a laugh they had had. She was always welcome in the kitchen. She made them laugh, she did. Things were better then than now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“晚上好，迈克纳布太大。”她说，然后告诉厨娘给她留一盘奶油汤——她觉得她拿着重重的一篮子衣服一直从镇上走来，挺需要吃点什么。她现在还能看见她，弯着身子在侍弄花；（有点模糊，忽隐忽现，像一道黄色的光束，或是望远镜末端的光圈，一位穿着灰色斗篷的夫人，弯着身子在侍弄花；当迈克纳布太太慢慢蹒珊着打扫房间，整理东西的时候，这个身影就在卧室的墙上、梳妆台上、脸盆架上徘徊飘忽）。那厨娘叫什么名字来着？米尔德里得？玛丽安？——类似的一个名字。唉，她忘了——她是爱忘事了。记得她暴躁得很，红头发的女人都这样。她们许多次在一起开怀大笑。她在厨房总是很受欢迎。她能逗大家笑，真是这样。那时候情况比现在好。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">她叹了口气;光让一个女人来干,这活可太多了.她这边那边地晃着脑袋.这里原来是育儿室.哎呀,这里面这么潮;墙皮开始住下掉了.他们干吗要在那里挂个野兽的头骨?而且也长霉了.阁楼的房间里到处是老鼠.雨水漏了进来.可是他们从来没有派人来:他们也不来.有的锁没了、因此门撞得砰砰响.她也不愿意黄昏的时候独自一个人呆在这里.光让一个女人来干,实在是够呛,够呛,太够呛了.她咯吱作响地移动着身子,哀叹着.她砰地关上了门.她用钥匙把门锁好,留下了一所门窗紧闭、上了锁的孤零零的屋子.</div>

<div class="line_en">She sighed; there was too much work for one woman. She wagged her head this side and that. This had been the nursery. Why, it was all damp in here; the plaster was falling. Whatever did they want to hang a beast's skull there? gone mouldy too. And rats in all the attics. The rain came in. But they never sent; never came. Some of the locks had gone, so the doors banged. She didn't like to be up here at dusk alone neither. It was too much for one woman, too much, too much. She creaked, she moaned. She banged the door. She turned the key in the lock, and left the house alone, shut up, locked.</div>
