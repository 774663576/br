<div class="line_en">Sansa had watched from the castle walls as Margaery Tyrell and her escort made their way up Aegon's High Hill. Joffrey had met his new bride-to-be at the King's Gate to welcome her to the city, and they rode side by side through cheering crowds, Joff glittering in gilded armor and the Tyrell girl splendid in green with a cloak of autumn flowers blowing from her shoulders. She was sixteen, brown-haired and brown-eyed, slender and beautiful. The people called out her name as she passed, held up their children for her blessing, and scattered flowers under the hooves of her horse. Her mother and grandmother followed close behind, riding in a tall wheelhouse whose sides were carved into the shape of a hundred twining roses, every one gilded and shining. The smallfolk cheered them as well.</div>

<div class="line_en">The invitation seemed innocent enough, but every time Sansa read it her tummy tightened into a knot. She's to be queen now, she's beautiful and rich and everyone loves her, why would she want to sup with a traitor's daughter? It could be curiosity, she supposed; perhaps Margaery Tyrell wanted to get the measure of the rival she'd displaced. Does she resent me, I wonder? Does she think I bear her ill Will…</div>

<div class="line_en">No one can save me but my Florian. Ser Dontos had promised he would help her escape, but not until the night of Joffrey's wedding.

<div class="line_en">The same smallfolk who pulled me from my horse and would have killed me, if not for the Hound. Sansa had done nothing to make the commons hate her, no more than Margaery Tyrell had done to win their love. Does she want me to love her too? She studied the invitation, which looked to be written in Margaery's own hand. Does she want my blessing? Sansa wondered if Joffrey knew of this supper. For all she knew, it might be his doing. That thought made her fearful. If Joff was behind the invitation, he would have some cruel jape planned to shame her in the older girl's eyes. Would he command his Kingsguard to strip her naked once again? The last time he had done that his uncle Tyrion had stopped him, but the Imp could not save her now.</div>

<div class="line_en">I wish the Hound were here. The night of the battle, Sandor Clegane had come to her chambers to take her from the city, but Sansa had refused. Sometimes she lay awake at night, wondering if she'd been wise. She had his stained white cloak hidden in a cedar chest beneath her summer silks. She could not say why she'd kept it. The Hound had turned craven, she heard it said; at the height of the battle, he got so drunk the Imp had to take his men. But Sansa understood. She knew the secret of his burned face. It was only the fire he feared. That night, the wildfire had set the river itself ablaze, and filled the very air with green flame. Even in the castle, Sansa had been afraid. Outside… she could scarcely imagine it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="真希望猎狗在我身旁。激战正酣的那个晚上，桑铎·克里冈来到她的卧室，想带她逃出城去，却被珊莎拒绝。近来，她常在深夜里醒来，思索自己的决定是否明智。她把他那身污染的白袍藏在装夏季丝绸衣衫的雪松木箱里，却不知为何要这样做。人们都说猎狗是懦夫，战斗进行到最高潮时，他喝得大醉，只能由小恶魔代他率军出击。珊莎理解他，她知道他那半边烧烂脸庞的秘密。他只怕火。那一晚，野火让长河自己似乎都燃烧起来，空中满是绿色烈焰。身处城堡以内，珊莎尚且感到无比恐惧，在外面…简直不堪设想。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Perhaps she was doing Margaery Tyrell an injustice. Perhaps the invitation was no more than a simple kindness, an act of courtesy. It might be just a supper. But this was the Red Keep, this was King's Landing, this was the court of King Joffrey Baratheon, the First of His Name, and if there was one thing that Sansa Stark had learned here, it was mistrust.</div>

The sight of Ser Loras Tyrell standing on her threshold made Sansa's heart beat a little faster. This was the first time she had been so close to him since he had returned to King's Landing, leading the vanguard of his father's host. For a moment she did not know what to say. "Ser Loras," she finally managed, "you… you look so lovely."</div>

<div class="line_en">Sansa reddened. Any fool would have realized that no woman would be happy about being called "the Queen of Thorns." Maybe I truly am as stupid as Cersei Lannister says. Desperately she tried to think of something clever and charming to say to him, but her wits had deserted her. She almost told him how beautiful he was, until she remembered that she'd already done that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="珊莎脸红了。傻瓜都知道没有女人会喜欢“荆棘女王”这种外号。也许瑟曦·兰尼斯特说得没错，我确实是个苯女孩。她努力搜寻机智或有趣的事来和他攀谈，可一切风趣都离她远去。她想称赞他的帅气，却意识到自己已经说过了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He was beautiful, though. He seemed taller than he'd been when she'd first met him, but still so lithe and graceful, and Sansa had never seen another boy with such wonderful eyes. He's no boy, though, he's a man grown, a knight of the Kingsguard. She thought he looked even finer in white than in the greens and golds of House Tyrell. The only spot of color on him now was the brooch that clasped his cloak; the rose of Highgarden wrought in soft yellow gold, nestled in a bed of delicate green jade leaves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可他真的好漂亮。自打上次见面以来，他似乎长高了，但柔和与优雅丝毫不减，珊莎没见别的男孩子有他那对绝妙的眼瞳。不，他不是男孩子，是大人了，是御林铁卫的一员。她觉得他穿白袍比穿提利尔家族绿色和金色的服装还要好看许多。全身上下，惟一的异色来自于扣住披风的胸针，那是一朵柔金制成、黄澄澄的高庭玫瑰，配有精致的绿宝石树叶。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It is." Ser Loras laughed. He has the warmest laugh, she thought as he went on, "You'd best not use that name in her presence, though, or you're like to get pricked."</div>

<div class="line_en">Ser Balon Swann held the door of Maegor's for them to pass. He was all in white as well, though he did not wear it half so well as Ser Loras. Beyond the spiked moat, two dozen men were taking their practice with sword and shield. With the castle so crowded, the outer ward had been given over to guests to raise their tents and pavilions, leaving only the smaller inner yards for training. One of the Redwyne twins was being driven backward by Ser Tallad, with the eyes on his shield. Chunky Ser Kennos of Kayce, who chuffed and puffed every time he raised his longsword, seemed to be holding his own against Osney Kettleblack, but Osney's brother Ser Osfryd was savagely punishing the frog-faced squire Morros Slynt. Blunted swords or no, Slynt would have a rich crop of bruises by the morrow. It made Sansa wince Just to watch. They have scarcely finished burying the dead from the last battle, and already they are practicing for the next one.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="今天把守梅葛楼大门的是巴隆·史文爵士。他同样一身雪白，却没洛拉斯爵士一半好看。走过钉满尖刺的护城河，二十多个男人正在院子里练武。近来城堡十分拥挤，外院早已让给宾客们搭建营帐，只剩狭小的内庭用于训练。雷德温家双胞胎中的一个被塔拉德爵士打得节节败退，雇佣骑士的盾牌上有眼睛的徽章。凯切镇的肯洛斯爵士生得矮胖，尽管每次提剑都气喘吁吁，却能勉力抵挡奥斯尼·凯特布莱克，与之相对，奥斯尼的兄弟奥斯佛利把青蛙脸的侍从莫洛斯·史林特一顿好揍，不管用的是不是钝剑，反正史林特看起来全身青肿。珊莎瞧见不禁一缩。他们还没埋葬上场战争的尸体，就已在为下场战争做准备了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Lord Mace Tyrell and his entourage had been housed behind the royal sept, in the long slate-roofed keep that had been called the Maidenvault since King Baelor the Blessed had confined his sisters therein, so the sight of them might not tempt him into carnal thoughts. Outside its tall carved doors stood two guards in gilded halffielms and green cloaks edged in gold satin, the golden rose of Highgarden sewn on their breasts. Both were seven-footers, wide of shoulder and narrow of waist, magnificently muscled. When Sansa got close enough to see their faces, she could not tell one from the other. They had the same strong jaws, the same deep blue eyes, the same thick red mustaches. "Who are they?" she asked Ser Loras, her discomfit forgotten for a moment.</div>

If truth be told, even our claim to Highgarden is a bit dodgy, just as those dreadful Florents are always whining.
