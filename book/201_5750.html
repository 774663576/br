<div class="line_cn" title="第二天早上吃早饭前，哈利、罗恩和赫敏在公共休息室里碰面了。哈利希望有人支持他的想法，便立刻把他在霍格沃茨特快列车上偷听到的马尔福的话告诉了赫敏。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Exactly," said Harry, but he could nor press the point, because so many people were trying to listen in to his conversation, not to mention staring at him and whispering behind their hands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊。”哈利说，可是他没法进一步说明他的观点，因为许多同学不仅好奇地盯着他看，用手捂着嘴窃窃私语，而且还侧着耳朵听他说话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's rude to point," Ron snapped at a particularly minuscule first-year boy as they joined the queue to climb out of the portrait hole. The boy, who had been muttering something about Harry behind his hand to his friend, promptly turned scarlet and toppled out of the hole in alarm. Ron sniggered. "I love being a sixth year. And were going to be getting free time this year. Whole periods when we can just sit up here and relax."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“指指点点不礼貌！”他们排队通过肖像洞口时，罗恩冲一个特别矮小的一年级男生厉声喝道。那男生正在用手挡着嘴巴跟朋友嘀咕关于哈利的什么话，被罗恩这么一喝，顿时脸涨得通红，惊慌失措地从洞口跌了出去。罗恩得意地笑出了声。“我真喜欢上六年级。而且今年我们会有许多自由时间，可以整节课整节课地坐在这里，什么也不干。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="赫敏的抗议被一阵响亮的咯咯笑声淹没了。拉文德·布朗似乎觉得罗恩的话特别好玩，她从他们身边经过时，还扭头朝罗恩看了几眼。罗恩显得非常得意。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Hold it!" said Hermione, throwing out an arm and halting a passing fourth year, who was attempting to push past her with a lime-green disk clutched tightly in his hand. "Fanged Frisbees banned, hand it over," she told him sternly. The scowling boy handed over the snarling Frisbee, ducked under her arm, and took off after his friends. Ron waited for him to vanish, then tugged the Frisbee from Hermione's grip.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“站住！”赫敏说着一把拦住一个四年级学生，那学生手里紧紧抓着一个深绿色的圆盘，正想从她身边挤过去。“狼牙飞碟是违禁物，快交出来。”赫敏严厉地对他说。那个愁眉苦脸的男生交出了那个咆哮的飞碟，一猫腰从赫敏胳膊底下钻过，追他的朋友们去了。罗恩等他走远了，便把飞碟从赫敏手里夺了过来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The ceiling of the Great Hall was serenely blue and streaked with frail, wispy clouds, just like the squares of sky visible through the high mullioned windows.

<div class="line_cn" title="“是这么回事。对吧？”罗恩说着把一个炸鸡蛋囫囵吞了下去，“因为我们喜欢海格，所以在他的课上是最用功的。可他还以为我们喜欢那门愚蠢的功课呢。你们说有谁会去上他的提高班呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Neither Harry nor Hermione answered; there was no need. They knew perfectly well that nobody in their year would want to continue Care of Magical Creatures. They avoided Hagrid's eye and returned his cheery wave only half-heartedly when he left the staff table ten minutes later.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利和赫敏都没有回答。这个问题无需回答。他们知道得很清楚，在他们年级中，没有一个人想上保护神奇生物课的。十分钟后，当海格离开教工餐桌，兴高采烈地跟他们挥手打招呼时，他们躲避着他的目光，浮皮潦草地朝他挥了挥手。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After they had eaten, they remained in their places, awaiting Professor McGonagall's descent from the staff table. The distribution of class schedules was more complicated than usual this year, for Professor McGonagall needed first to confirm that everybody had achieved the necessary O. W.

Ron thought it most likely to be spectacular jinxes and hexes of the type the Death Eaters would not know. Hermione said such things were illegal, and thought it much more likely that Dumbledore wanted to teach Harry advanced Defensive magic. After break, she went off to Arithmancy while Harry and Ron returned to the common room where they grudgingly started Snape's homework. This turned out to be so complex that they still had not finished when Hermione joined them for their after-lunch free period (though she considerably speeded up the process).

<div class="line_en">"The clear winner!" he cried to the dungeon. "Excellent, excellent, Harry! Good lord, it's clear you've inherited your mother's talent. She was a dab hand at Potions, Lily was! Here you are, then, here you are -- one bottle of Felix Felicis, as promised, and use it well!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“无可争议的优胜者！”他对地下教室的全班同学大声说，“出色，太出色了，哈利！天哪，你显然继承了你母亲的天赋，莉莉当年在魔药课上就是如此心灵手巧！给，拿去吧——我说话算数，给你一瓶福灵剂，好好利用！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Once they were securely ensconced at the Gryffindor table for dinner, however, he felt safe enough to tell them. Hermione's face became stonier with every word he uttered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等到他们在格兰芬多餐桌旁坐定、准备吃午饭时，他觉得比较安全了，才把实话告诉了他们。赫敏听着他的叙述，脸色越来越阴沉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I s'pose you think I cheated?" he finished, aggravated by her expression.</div>

<div class="line_en">"He only followed different instructions to ours," said Ron, "Could've been a catastrophe, couldn't it? But he took a risk and it paid off." He heaved a sigh. "Slughorn could've handed me that book, but no, I get the one no one's ever written on. Puked on, by the look of page fifty-two, but --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他只是按照和我们不同的方法操作的，”罗恩说，“也可能会闯大祸的，是不是？他冒险了，所以得到了补偿。”他叹了口气。“斯拉格霍恩本来可能把那本书递给我的，可是，唉，没有谁在我那课本上写过字。从五十二页的情形来看，好像有人在上面吐过，但是——”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Hang on," said a voice close by Harry's left ear and he caught a sudden waft of that flowery smell he had picked up in Slughorn's dungeon. He looked around and saw that Ginny had joined them. "Did I hear right? You've been taking orders from something someone wrote in a book, Harry?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“等等。”哈利左耳边上一个声音说道，他又闻到了他在斯拉格霍恩课堂里闻到的那种花香味儿。他扭头看见金妮也加入了他们的谈话。“我没有听错吧，哈利？你一直在按照别人写在一本书上的指令做事？”">查看中文翻译</div>

"Specialis Revelio!" she said, rapping it smartly on the front cover. Nothing whatsoever happened. The book simply lay there, looking old and dirty and dog-eared.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“喂！”哈利气愤地抗议道，赫敏一把抽出哈利书包里的那本《高级魔药制作》，举起了魔杖。“原形立现！”她干脆利落地敲了敲封面，念道。什么动静也没有。课本还是课本，破旧，肮脏，书角都卷起来了。">查看中文翻译</div>
