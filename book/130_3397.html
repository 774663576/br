<div class="line_en">Dinner the evening was a lively affair. Pastor Brown had espoused the cause of the water project and called a conference. His latest innovation was solar power. Quite reasonably, he had decided that it was a scandalous waste of resources to haul gas and paraffin into the heart of Africa simply to burn them. Investigation of the mail-order catalogues that he favoured had provided, after suitable delay, a huge sheet of solar panels that he installed on the roof of his house. By the simple expedient of exposing these to blinding sunlight throughout the day, he was able to entice a single bulb to glow for several hours of the night. Immediately he cut off all other forms of energy, which reduced his family to scuttling about with torches while the Great Bulb glowed in the living-room. Here we sat to eat, blinking like hedgehogs in the beam of a car's headlights. To supply the Great Bulb, large holes had been knocked in the ceiling. This was unfortunate as the roof space was inhabited to bursting with bats whose faces bore a curious sneering expression. Attracted by the Great Bulb, they swooped and circled, casting huge shadows on the walls. Blinded by the Great Bulb, they regularly thudded into obstructions or threatened to become entangled in the diners' hair. One of the endemic cats had decided to exploit the situation with some impromptu leaps and dives, bringing down bats that she carried to a corner and devoured with horrendous crunching and slurping noises. Occasionally, Pastor Brown would be driven to the point of incoherent rage by this flying vermin and fire off a couple of rounds from the air-rifle he kept by his chair, screaming in Fulani as he did so. The guests, the cat, other members of the family would fling themselves to the floor as pieces of bat and plasterboard descended into the food.</div>

<div class="line_en">With the blessing of the sous-préfet, it was decided that the town should have, as mentioned earlier, a clean water supply. This was, indeed, an urgent necessity. Most fatalities in the area were due to water-borne diseases. There was little point in the doctor devoting time and drugs to the treatment of bilharzia and other parasites for as soon as people went near the river, which all used for washing, drinking and dumping sewage in, they were reinfected. Various possibilities were discussed. A series of wells was proposed. This would have been ruinously expensive. Wells, moreover, are easily polluted. It was finally decided that the only way was to take the water from one of the perpetual rivers in the hills inhabited by the Dowayos. This was where I came in.</div>

<div class="line_en">The doctor hoped quite reasonably to eradicate at a stroke the major component of his case-load. Most of the endemic fatal diseases either derived from impure water sources or else these sources so debilitated local inhabitants that otherwise mild infections proved fatal. He had despaired of treating villagers who promptly became reinfected when they returned to their homes. Pure water was the only way to break the cycle.</div>

<div class="line_en">As an anthropologist, I was most uncomfortable of all. Although anthropology studies people, it does so at a certain remove, less as individuals than as representatives of some collective culture. Studying the way a people behaves and seeking to direct that behaviour are, in theory, two different things, though no anthropologist leaves his people unchanged. While not wishing endemic diseases on anyone, I was doubtful whether the project would be pursued except at the expense of the Dowayos. Taking the water from the hills to give to the town would be seen by Dowayos as the stealing of their water to give to Fulani invaders. Normally, water from these mountains could not be drunk even by Dowayos except with the express permission of the rain-chief since it belonged to him. It was vital to the irrigation of the hills and for the support of the dwarf cattle that were the joy of the Dowayos. I knew enough of the local situation to expect that the Dowayos would be required to furnish most of the labour. They would be far from willing to give this except on their own terms. The sous-préfet too was a determined man who would brook no opposition in what was clearly a project for the great general good. If the Dowayos would not work willingly, they would be forced to work. I foresaw a great deal of unhappiness and trouble for what I had come to regard in an inevitably paternalistic way as 'my' people. It was true that certain nods were made in favour of safeguarding rights of access to Dowayos, but it was difficult to know how much store was to be set on these.</div>

<div class="line_en">I never knew the end of the project, whether it came to fruition or not‚ whether the funding simply disappeared quietly somewhere along the way, whether it died in bitterness or torpor. The last I heard of it was from the sous-préfet just before I left for England. He explained that latest costings suggested that the whole stream would have to be simply put in a pipe to supply the town without any access for Dowayos along the way‚ as this would be too expensive. This would involve initial discomfort and adjustment but would be a more efficient use of the water and, after all, the Dowayos could always move.</div>

It would be interesting to see what they made of their first cinema show. The younger men‚ of course, had been to the city and sampled many of the delights of modernity such as the cinema. It was certain that the old women here would never have seen anything even remotely similar. I settled back cosily and composed the list of questions I would ask.

Close-ups of agonized human faces, streaming with sweat, followed immediately afterwards implying -- to us -- a causal connection. Martial music blared from loudspeakers on the roof of one of the Land-Rovers to accompany a map of Africa down which a sort of dark cloud spread like wine on a tablecloth. There was a vague background noise of a commentary in French quite drowned out by the man in the peaked cap who ad-libbed his own version in Fulani.

While they accept the immaterial and insubstantial nature of the images presented to them, they never believe that the cowboys are only actors and that they are not really being shot but only pretending.

<div class="line_en">The hirsute white man eventually noticed me and came across. We circled each other with the wariness of sniffing dogs. He proved to be German. He appeared more than a little piqued that interest in the mosquito film was not greater, explaining with visible satisfaction that sometimes people fled screaming from the images of giant insects. On the basis of this, he had developed a sort of philosophy of size. People only saw reality when it was big. The world could be transformed merely by an act of magnification. Had not the magnifying glass changed our perception of things? The camera would do yet more. Quite gratuitously, I thought of a cartoon I had once witnessed showing a giant rabbit pushing over the skyscrapers of New York. The caption read, 'If that were a gorilla, people would be worried.' I wisely kept the image to myself. Normally, he revealed, he only showed one serious film, otherwise people were liable to become confused about the message he was trying to get across. Since the mosquito film had not gone too well, he wondered about following it up with a hot little number on birth control. He had had it in his possession for some time but always hesitated to try it out on an even partly Muslim audience. Since the people here were pagans, there could surely be no problem?</div>

<div class="line_en">Although Dowayos are much given to fornication from an early age, adultery playing much the same role in their out-of-work activities that television plays in our own, they are prudes. The sexes must not see each other naked even in wedlock. To do so would be to risk dire repercussions. A man would become catatonic, a woman become blind. A boy must know nothing of the sexuality of his mother or sister. They, in turn, would be horribly humiliated by reference to the sexuality of a male relative. The insistent obscenity of all-male rituals is the most common pretext advanced for the exclusion of women from all the most important activities. Really close friends of the same sex are those who can be obscene in their talk to each other, indeed must be so on risk of ruining the relationship.</div>

<div class="line_en">Looking round the public circle, there was Marie, the chief's third wife, with her brothers on a visit from the mountains, one of them holding his little daughter on his knees. Over the other side was a venerable mother with her sons and grandsons ranged respectfully about her. It was very tempting to unleash upon them a film of explicit sexual content. It would certainly be the ultimate test of who could work out what was happening on the screen. In my mind's eye, I pictured the results -- everyone flying in opposite directions, hot-faced with shame, uttering cries of outrage, faces averted, eyes on the ground, genitals clutched in deep embarrassment.</div>

<div class="line_en">There is something in everyone that wants to break windows‚ release mice at a gathering of maiden aunts, spike their tea with unexpected gin. The prospect of the birth-control film was deeply alluring. But I knew that the villagers would be more than just shocked in a way that they would laugh about afterwards, they would be deeply and permanently shamed. The only solution would have been to have separate showings for males and females.</div>

<div class="line_en">Further enquiry revealed that the film was of Swedish origin and involved only white participants whose faces were obscured. It was hard to know what the Dowayos would make of that. It seemed likely, however, that they could scarcely absorb any appropriate message concerning birth control but would rather become bogged down in the incidentals of the performance. The Dowayos certainly have no interest in birth control. In this they have much in common with West Africans generally. It has been said, with a certain amount of justice, that the only material that may be sent through the internal postal service with absolutely no risk of molestation is contraceptives. Dowayos are much concerned to have as many children as possible and infertility is frequently advanced as a reason for divorce. 'Does a man dig a field to raise no crops?' as Zuuldibo tactfully put it. This is not to be regarded as foolish self-indulgence, blind to ecological concerns. The natural fertility of Dowayos is so low from endemic venereal disease, dietary imbalance and the mutilations of the circumcision ceremony, the rate of infant mortality so high, that there is no risk of a population explosion. Sadly, the German went away and packed up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="探询后，我得知影片是瑞典拍的，演员全是白人，而且面目模糊。很难判断多瓦悠人会认为他们是什么。无论哪种状况，他们都不太可能吸收避孕知识，反而深陷表演细节等泥淖。多瓦悠人当然对避孕不感兴趣。这点，他们和多数西非人相同。你甚至可以说避孕药是少数透过邮寄而不会不翼而飞的东西。多瓦悠人感兴趣的是多子多孙，不育是离婚的常见理由。诚如祖帝保机智之言：“男人辛勤耕田，岂是为了寸草不生？”这可不是愚蠹自溺、对生态永续漠不关心。事实是多瓦悠人受地区性性病肆虐、营养不均衡、割礼损伤、婴儿天折率过高等因素影响，自然生育率非常之低，绝无人口爆炸之危机。德国人甚感失望，卷铺盖走人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">With the younger people, I fared much better. There were some interesting interpretations to be looked into. Tom had quite generally been identified as a leopard. Although he had no spots, he lacked the stripes that generally characterized cats in Dowayoland. Cats, in this area, are universally of the tabby kind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="至于年轻人部分，我的运气便好多了。他们对影片的解释颇多值得探究之处。譬如他们认为汤姆猫是只豹子，虽然汤姆身上无斑点花纹，也没有多瓦悠兰猫儿常见的条纹。此地的猫几乎全是虎斑猫。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Profiting from this windfall, I was able to begin my explorations into visual anthropology the next day. First, I homed in on the group of loquacious old ladies who had witnessed the performance, all of whom were known to me by name. Accounts of what they had witnessed were understandably confused. In West Africa, it is seldom the case that there are the performers and there is the audience, the latter being expected to observe in silence the activities of the former. The line is never that sharp. The 'audience' expect to participate in the activities of the 'actors' in a way that would justify eviction from most Western performative events. What they remembered were the witty comments they had made in turn on the spectacle presented to them. Some were, moreover, so old and afflicted with cataracts that they only had a very hazy notion of what had occurred on the screen. This point became obvious when I noted that each old lady gave me a different list of her friends who had been in the group.</div>

<div class="line_en">Most seemed to have arrived at a surprisingly coherent interpretation of what had happened on the screen. It is true that I had not seen the film with them, but I remembered it well from my misspent youth. Matthieu and I busied ourselves greatly with note-taking. It was, for example, interesting that Dowayos offered up accounts of the film in forms appropriate to the Dowayo folktale, ending with the formula, 'So… It is finished.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们对剧情的解释却颇一致。我虽然没跟他们一起看“汤姆猫与杰利鼠”，但是在我浪掷岁月的年少时期也看过，所以大约记得剧情。马修与我忙着记笔记。特别引人兴味的是他们以典型多瓦悠民间故事的形态叙述剧情，套用结尾公式“所以……故事结束”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As for the moral of the mosquito film, I fear it was largely lost on the audience. Of course, people explained, they accepted the point that the huge, slavering mosquitoes they had witnessed on the screen could be dangerous and even kill a man. Luckily, those in Dowayoland were quite different, tiny by comparison. Those on the screen had been bigger than a man. Here, in Dowayoland, they were minute. How had the white man not noticed this?</div>
