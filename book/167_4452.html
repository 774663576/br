<div class="line_en">Sweet it was, sweet and gone too soon. Dawn came cruel, a dagger of light. She woke aching and alone and weary; weary of riding, weary of hurting, weary of duty. I want to weep, she thought. I want to be comforted. I'm so tired of being strong. I want to be foolish and frightened for once. Just for a small while, that's all… a day… an hour…</div>

<div class="line_en">Outside her tent, men were stirring. She heard the whicker of horses, Shadd complaining of stiffness in his back, Ser Wendel calling for his bow. Catelyn wished they would all go away. They were good men, loyal, yet she was tired of them all. It was her children she yearned after. One day, she promised herself as she lay abed, one day she would allow herself to be less than strong.</div>

<div class="line_en">Outside, Shadd was stirring oats into a kettle, while Ser Wendel Manderly sat stringing his bow. "My lady," he said when Catelyn emerged. "There are birds in this grass. Would you fancy a roast quail to break your fast this morning?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="出了门，只见夏德正用壶煮燕麦粥，文德尔·曼德勒爵士则在调试弓箭。“夫人，”凯特琳出来时他道，“原野上空有鸟儿呢。要不我给您的早餐加点烤肉？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"As you will, my lady." The knight's moon face looked crestfallen, the tips of his great walrus mustache twitching with disappointment.

<div class="line_cn" title="“如您所愿，夫人。”圆脸骑士有些丧气，海象般的大把胡须失望地颤动。“燕麦和面包，还有什么比这更好？”他是凯特琳所识最为肥胖的人之一，他不仅爱食物，对荣誉的渴求更是甚而过之。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She cradled the tea in her scarred hands and blew on it to cool it. Shadd was one of the Winterfell men. Robb had sent twenty of his best to see her safely to Renly. He had sent five lordlings as well, whose names and high birth would add weight and honor to her mission. As they made their way south, staying well clear of towns and holdfasts, they had seen bands of mailed men more than once, and glimpsed smoke on the eastern horizon, but none had dared molest them. They were too weak to be a threat, too many to be easy prey. Once across the Blackwater, the worst was behind. For the past four days, they had seen no signs of war.</div>

<div class="line_en">Catelyn had never wanted this. She had told Robb as much, back in Riverrun. "When last I saw Renly, he was a boy no older than Bran. I do not know him. Send someone else. My place is here with my father, for whatever time he has left."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此行并非凯特琳的意思。在奔流城，她和罗柏争辩了许多。“我上次见到蓝礼时，他还没你弟弟布兰大。我根本就不了解他。派别人去。我有责任留在这里陪伴父亲，直到他的时辰最后到来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I cannot sit at Riverrun waiting for peace. It makes me look as if I were afraid to take the field again. When there are no battles to fight, men start to think of hearth and harvest, Father told me that. Even my northmen grow restless."</div>

<div class="line_en">Her son had looked at her unhappily. "There is no one else. I cannot go myself. Your father's too ill. The Blackfish is my eyes and ears, I dare not lose him. Your brother I need to hold Riverrun when we march --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="儿子不悦地望着她。“没别人可派。我不可能亲自去。你父亲病得太厉害。黑鱼则是我的耳目，我不能缺了他。至于你弟弟，我需要他坐镇奔流城，当我们进军——”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The memory brought a wan smile to her face. Such an obvious ploy, that, yet deft for a boy of fifteen. Robb knew how ill-suited a man like Greatjon Umber would be to treat with a man like Renly Baratheon, and he knew that she knew it as well. What could she do but accede, praying that her father would live until her return? Had Lord Hoster been well, he would have gone himself, she knew. Still, that leavetaking was hard, hard. He did not even know her when she came to say farewell. "Minisa," he called her, "where are the children? My little Cat, my sweet Lysa…" Catelyn had kissed him on the brow and told him his babes were well. "Wait for me, my lord," she said as his eyes closed. "I waited for you, oh, so many times. Now you must wait for me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="忆起往事，她的脸颊泛起苍白的微笑。多直白的要挟，说真的，一个十五岁的男孩能做到这点，倒应该感到骄傲。罗柏深知与蓝礼·拜拉席恩这样的人打交道没有比大琼恩·安柏更不合适的人选了，他更明白她也知道。他让她无法拒绝，只能祈祷在返回之前父亲别有什么不测。她想：倘若霍斯特公爵身体安康，一定会自告奋勇担任使节。纵使百般宽慰，离别依旧让人伤感。当她到床前辞行时，他甚至根本不认得她。“米妮莎，”他唤她，“孩子们在哪儿？我的小凯特，我可爱的莱莎…”凯特琳吻了他的额头，告诉他他的宝贝们一切都好。“等我回来，大人，”当他阖上倦眼，她轻声说。“我等过你，噢，等了好多好多次。这次轮到了你，一定要等我回来。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Her bowl was empty, though she could scarce remember tasting the porridge. She laid it aside. "It is time we were away." The sooner she spoke to Renly, the sooner she could turn for home. She was the first one mounted, and she set the pace for the column. Hal Mollen rode beside her, bearing the banner of House Stark, the grey direwolf on an ice-white field.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她食不知味，勉强咽下麦片粥，把碗放到一旁。“我们该出发了。”越早见到蓝礼，她就能越早打道回府。她头一个翻上马背，带领纵队快速前进。哈里斯·莫兰骑行身旁，高举史塔克家族的旗帜。雪白布底上的冰原狼迎风招展。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They were still a half day's ride from Renly's camp when they were taken. Robin Flint had ranged ahead to scout, and he came galloping back with word of a far-eyes watching from the roof of a distant windmill. By the time Catelyn's party reached the mill, the man was long gone. They pressed on, covering not quite a mile before Renly's outriders came swooping down on them, twenty men mailed and mounted, led by a grizzled greybeard of a knight with bluejays on his surcoat.</div>

<div class="line_en">"King Renly is the crowned and anointed lord of all the Seven Kingdoms, my lady," Ser Colen answered, though courteously enough. "His Grace is encamped with his host near Bitterbridge, where the roseroad crosses the Mander. It shall be my great honor to escort you to him." The knight raised a mailed hand, and his men formed a double column flanking Catelyn and her guard. Escort or captor? she wondered. There was nothing to be done but trust in Ser Colen's honor, and Lord Renly's.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“蓝礼国王是经正式加冕涂抹圣油的七国之君，夫人。”科棱爵士应道，礼貌依然。“陛下此刻和他的军队一道驻扎于苦桥，那是玫瑰大道横跨曼德河的要害，护送您前往是我莫大的荣幸。”骑士举起一只铁拳，手下士兵闪向两边，站在凯特琳和她的护卫侧旁。这是护送还是捉拿？她心想。如今也只好信任科棱爵士的荣誉，当然，还得信任蓝礼大人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Our business is urgent," she answered him. "I come as envoy from my son, Robb Stark, the King in the North, to treat with Renly Baratheon, the King in the South."</div>

<div class="line_en">They saw the smoke of the camp's fires when they were still an hour from the river. Then the sound came drifting across farm and field and rolling plain, indistinct as the murmur of some distant sea, but swelling as they rode closer. By the time they caught sight of the Mander's muddy waters glinting in the sun, they could make out the voices of men, the clatter of steel, the whinny of horses. Yet neither sound nor smoke prepared them for the host itself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="离大河尚有一小时骑程，他们便看见营火的烟柱。接着，各种声音飘过农场、田地和原野汹涌而来，朦朦胧胧，有如远海的呼唤。渐行渐近，涛声便愈加强烈。待他们终于瞧见阳光下闪耀的浑浊的曼德河水，声音也变得清晰，分辨出人语，金铁交击和马嘶。对他们而言，尽管有先前的烟柱和声响预作提醒，仍旧不由自主地为眼前的大军张口结舌。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Near all the chivalry of the south had come to Renly's call, it seemed. The golden rose of Highgarden was seen everywhere: sewn on the right breast of armsmen and servants, flapping and fluttering from the green silk banners that adorned lance and pike, painted upon the shields hung outside the pavilions of the sons and brothers and cousins and uncles of House Tyrell. As well Catelyn spied the fox-and-flowers of House Florent, Fossoway apples red and green, Lord Tarly's striding huntsman, oak leaves for Oakheart, cranes for Crane, a cloud of black-and-orange butterflies for the Mullendores.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看来，几乎所有的南境贵族都响应了蓝礼的号召。四处可见高庭的金玫瑰：绣在兵士和仆人们的右胸前，招展在装饰长枪和木矛的绿丝幡上，刻画在提利尔家族五花八门的旁支——儿子、兄弟、表亲、叔舅——帐门的盾牌上。凯特琳还看见佛罗伦家族的狐狸鲜花旗，两支佛索威家族的青苹果旗和红苹果旗，塔利伯爵的健步猎人旗，奥克赫特家族的橡树叶旗，克连恩家族的鹅旗，以及穆伦道尔家族那描绘成群黑橙蝴蝶的旗帜。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Thousands of cookfires filled the air with a pale smoky haze. The horse lines alone stretched out over leagues. A forest had surely been felled to make the tall staffs that held the banners. Great siege engines lined the grassy verge of the roseroad, mangonels and trebuchets and rolling rams mounted on wheels taller than a man on horseback. The steel points of pikes flamed red with sunlight, as if already blooded, while the pavilions of the knights and high lords sprouted from the grass like silken mushrooms. She saw men with spears and men with swords, men in steel caps and mail shirts, camp followers strutting their charms, archers fletching arrows, teamsters driving wagons, swineherds driving pigs, pages running messages, squires honing swords, knights riding palfreys, grooms leading ill-tempered destriers. "This is a fearsome lot of men," Ser Wendel Manderly observed as they crossed the ancient stone span from which Bitterbridge took its name.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="成千的营火使空中弥漫着苍白的薄雾。排列整齐的马匹绵延数个里格。为制造承载旌旗的长杆，一整座树林砍伐而光。巨大的攻城器排列在玫瑰大道两旁的葱绿草坪上，有投石机、弩炮和攻城锤，那冲锤光车轮就比一个骑兵还高。艳阳下，无数的矛尖闪着红光，仿佛正在泣血。诸侯和骑士们的营帐好似丝质蘑菇，遍布四野。她看见拿矛的兵、持剑的兵、戴盔穿甲的兵，看见招摇过市的营妓，看见搭装羽毛的弓箭手，看见驱赶货车的杂役，看见喂养牲畜的猪倌，看见传送信息的听差，看见磨砺长剑的侍从，看见驱策战马的骑士，看见呵斥劣驹的马夫。“不可思议…有这么多军队，”文德尔·曼德勒爵士评论。他们越过一道古老的石拱桥——此桥正名为“苦桥”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Across the Mander, the storm lords had raised their standards; Renly's own bannermen, sworn to House Baratheon and Storm's End. Catelyn recognized Bryce Caron's nightingales, the Penrose quills, and Lord Estermont's sea turtle, green on green. Yet for every shield she knew, there were a dozen strange to her, borne by the small lords sworn to the bannermen, and by hedge knights and freeriders, who had come swarming to make Renly Baratheon a king in fact as well as name.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="曼德河对岸，风暴之地的领主们也升起了自己的旗帜——他们是蓝礼直属的附庸，宣誓效忠于拜拉席恩家族和风息堡。凯特琳认出布莱斯·卡伦的夜莺旗，庞洛斯的鹅毛旗，以及伊斯蒙伯爵的海龟旗——绿色的汪洋上漂浮的绿海龟。但除开她认识的盾牌徽记，另有十几个异常陌生，想来他们该是效忠于地方诸侯的下级领主，或是雇佣骑士和自由骑手，这些人麇集到蓝礼·拜拉席恩周围，为的是要在这场权力的游戏中站在胜利者的一边。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Renly's own standard flew high over all. From the top of his tallest siege tower, a wheeled oaken immensity covered with rawhides, streamed the largest war banner that Catelyn had ever seen -- a cloth big enough to carpet many a hall, shimmering gold, with the crowned stag of Baratheon black upon it, prancing proud and tall.</div>

From the looks of the grounds, torn and muddy and littered with bits of dinted armor and broken lances, they had been at it for a day or more, but now the end was near. Fewer than a score of knights remained ahorse, charging and slashing at each other as watchers and fallen combatants cheered them on.

Ser Colen walked his horse slowly through the throngs, with Catelyn riding in his wake. A roar went up from the crowd as a helmetless red-bearded man with a griffin on his shield went down before a big knight in blue armor. His steel was a deep cobalt, even the blunt morningstar he wielded with such deadly effect, his mount barded in the quartered sun-and-moon heraldry of House Tarth.</div>

<div class="line_en">The crowned stag decorated the king's green velvet tunic as well, worked in gold thread upon his chest; the Baratheon sigil in the colors of Highgarden. The girl who shared the high seat with him was also of Highgarden: his young queen, Margaery, daughter to Lord Mace Tyrell. Their marriage was the mortar that held the great southron alliance together, Catelyn knew. Renly was one-and-twenty, the girl no older than Robb, very pretty, with a doe's soft eyes and a mane of curling brown hair that fell about her shoulders in lazy ringlets. Her smile was shy and sweet.</div>

<div class="line_en">Out in the field, another man lost his seat to the knight in the rainbow-striped cloak, and the king shouted approval with the rest. "Loras!" she heard him call. "Loras! Highgarden!" The queen clapped her hands together in excitement.</div>

<div class="line_en">Catelyn turned to see the end of it. Only four men were left in the fight now, and there was small doubt whom king and commons favored. She had never met Ser Loras Tyrell, but even in the distant north one heard tales of the prowess of the young Knight of Flowers. Ser Loras rode a tall white stallion in silver mail, and fought with a long-handled axe. A crest of golden roses ran down the center of his helm.</div>

<div class="line_en">Two of the other survivors had made common cause. They spurred their mounts toward the knight in the cobalt armor. As they closed to either side, the blue knight reined hard, smashing one man full in the face with his splintered shield while his black destrier lashed out with a steel-shod hoof at the other. In a blink, one combatant was unhorsed, the other reeling. The blue knight let his broken shield drop to the ground to free his left arm, and then the Knight of Flowers was on him. The weight of his steel seemed to hardly diminish the grace and quickness with which Ser Loras moved, his rainbow cloak swirling about him.</div>

<div class="line_en">The blue knight charged into it. The stallions slammed together, the blunted axehead smashed against the scarred blue breastplate… but somehow the blue knight had the haft locked between steel-gauntleted fingers. He wrenched it from Ser Loras's hand, and suddenly the two were grappling mount-to-mount, and an instant later they were falling. As their horses pulled apart, they crashed to the ground with bone-jarring force. Loras Tyrell, on the bottom, took the brunt of the impact. The blue knight pulled a long dirk free and flicked open Tyrell's visor. The roar of the crowd was too loud for Catelyn to hear what Ser Loras said, but she saw the word form on his split, bloody lips. Yield.</div>

<div class="line_en">The white horse and the black one wheeled like lovers at a harvest dance, the riders throwing steel in place of kisses. Longaxe flashed and morningstar whirled. Both weapons were blunted, yet still they raised an awful clangor. Shieldless, the blue knight was getting much the worse of it. Ser Loras rained down blows on his head and shoulders, to shouts of "Highgarden!" from the throng. The other gave answer with his morningstar, but whenever the ball came crashing in, Ser Loras interposed his battered green shield, emblazoned with three golden roses. When the longaxe caught the blue knight's hand on the backswing and sent the morningstar flying from his grasp, the crowd screamed like a rutting beast. The Knight of Flowers raised his axe for the final blow.</div>

<div class="line_en">He limped toward the gallery. At close hand, the brilliant blue armor looked rather less splendid; everywhere it showed scars, the dents of mace and warhammer, the long gouges left by swords, chips in the enameled breastplate and helm. His cloak hung in rags. From the way he moved, the man within was no less battered. A few voices hailed him with cries of "Tarth!" and, oddly, 'A Beauty! A Beauty!" but most were silent. The blue knight knelt before the king. "Grace," he said, his voice muffled by his dented greathelm. "You are all your lord father claimed you were." Renly's voice carried over the field. "I've seen Ser Loras unhorsed once or twice… but never quite in that fashion."</div>

The pavilion was larger than the common rooms of many an inn and furnished with every comfort: feather mattress and sleeping furs, a wood-and-copper tub large enough for two, braziers, to keep off the night's chill, slung leather camp chairs, a writing table with quills and inkpot, bowls of peaches, plums, and pears, a flagon of wine with a set of matched silver cups, cedar chests packed full of Renly's clothing, books, maps, game boards, a high harp, a tall bow and a quiver of arrows, a pair of red-tailed hunting hawks, a vertible armory of fine weapons.

<div class="line_en">Ser Wendel Manderly, Lucas Blackwood, Ser Perwyn Frey, and the rest of her highborn companions accompanied her to the castle. The great hall of Lord Caswell's keep was great only by courtesy, yet room was found on the crowded benches for Catelyn's men, amidst Renly's own knights. Catelyn was assigned a place on the dais between red-faced Lord Mathis Rowan and genial Ser Jon Fossoway of the green-apple Fossoways. Ser Jon made jests, while Lord Mathis inquired politely after the health of her father, brother, and children.</div>

<div class="line_en">Beside the entrance, the king's armor stood sentry; a suit of forestgreen plate, its fittings chased with gold, the helm crowned by a great rack of golden antlers. The steel was polished to such a high sheen that she could see her reflection in the breastplate, gazing back at her as if from the bottom of a deep green pond. The face of a drowned woman, Catelyn thought. Can you drown in grief? She turned away sharply, angry with her own frailty. She had no time for the luxury of self-pity. She must wash the dust from her hair and change into a gown more fitting for a king's feast.</div>

<div class="line_en">Brienne of Tarth had been seated at the far end of the high table. She did not gown herself as a lady, but chose a knight's finery instead, a velvet doublet quartered rose-and-azure, breeches and boots and a finetooled swordbelt, her new rainbow cloak flowing down her back. No garb could disguise her plainness, though; the huge freckled hands, the wide flat face, the thrust of her teeth. Out of armor, her body seemed ungainly, broad of hip and thick of limb, with hunched muscular shoulders but no bosom to speak of. And it was clear from her every action that Brienne knew it, and suffered for it. She spoke only in answer, and seldom lifted her gaze from her food.</div>

<div class="line_en">Of food there was plenty. The war had not touched the fabled bounty of Highgarden. While singers sang and tumblers tumbled, they began with pears poached in wine, and went on to tiny savory fish rolled in salt and cooked crisp, and capons stuffed with onions and mushrooms. There were great loaves of brown bread, mounds of turnips and sweetcorn and pease, immense hams and roast geese and trenchers dripping full of venison stewed with beer and barley. For the sweet, Lord Caswell's servants brought down trays of pastries from his castle kitchens, cream swans and spun-sugar unicorns, lemon cakes in the shape of roses, spiced honey biscuits and blackberry tarts, apple crisps and wheels of buttery cheese.</div>

<div class="line_en">The rich foods made Catelyn queasy, but it would never do to show frailty when so much depended on her strength. She ate sparingly, while she watched this man who would be king. Renly sat with his young bride on his left hand and her brother on the right. Apart from the white linen bandage around his brow, Ser Loras seemed none the worse for the day's misadventures. He was indeed as comely as Catelyn had suspected he might be. When not glazed, his eyes were lively and intelligent, his hair an artless tumble of brown locks that many a maid might have envied. He had replaced his tattered tourney cloak with a new one; the same brilliantly striped silk of Renly's Rainbow Guard, clasped with the golden rose of Highgarden.</div>

He laughed often, and well, and spoke amiably to highborn lords and lowly serving wenches alike.</div>

Lord Willum's sons Josua and Elyas disputed heatedly about who would be first over the walls of King's Landing. Lord Varner dandled a serving girl on his lap, nuzzling at her neck while one hand went exploring down her bodice. Guyard the Green, who fancied himself a singer, diddled a harp and gave them a verse about tying lions' tails in knots, parts of which rhymed. Ser Mark Mullendore brought a black-and-white monkey and fed him morsels from his own plate, while Ser Tanton of the red-apple Fossoways climbed on the table and swore to slay Sandor Clegane in single combat.

The Knight of Flowers could not have reached his second name day when Robert slew Prince Rhaegar on the Trident. Few of the others were very much older. They had been babes during the Sack of King's Landing, and no more than boys when Balon Greyjoy raised the Iron Islands in rebellion. They are still unblooded, Catelyn thought as she watched Lord Bryce goad Ser Robar into juggling a brace of daggers.

<div class="line_en">"I liked your husband well enough, my lady. He was a loyal friend to Robert, I know… but he would not listen and he would not bend. Here, I wish to show you something."

<div class="line_cn" title="“我很欣赏您丈夫，夫人。他一直都是劳勃最忠实的朋友，我明白…但恕我直言，他脑筋太死，不懂能屈能伸的道理。现在，让我给您展示一番。”阶梯到了尽头，蓝礼推开一扇木门，带她踱到屋顶。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I have twice that number here," Renly said, "and this is only part of my strength. Mace Tyrell remains at Highgarden with another ten thousand, I have a strong garrison holding Storm's End, and soon enough the Dornishmen will join me with all their power. And never forget my brother Stannis, who holds Dragonstone and commands the lords of the narrow sea."</div>

<div class="line_en">Lord Caswell's keep was scarcely tall enough to call a tower, but the country was low and flat and Catelyn could see for leagues in all directions. Wherever she looked, she saw fires. They covered the earth like fallen stars, and like the stars there was no end to them. "Count them if you like, my lady," Renly said quietly. "You will still be counting when dawn breaks in the east. How many fires burn around Riverrun tonight, I wonder?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Renly shrugged. "Tell me, what right did my brother Robert ever have to the Iron Throne?" He did not wait for an answer. "Oh, there was talk of the blood ties between Baratheon and Targaryen, of weddings a hundred years past, of second sons and elder daughters. No one but the maesters care about any of it. Robert won the throne with his warhammer." He swept a hand across the campfires that burned from horizon to horizon. "Well, there is my claim, as good as Robert's ever was. If your son supports me as his father supported Robert, he'll not find me ungenerous. I will gladly confirm him in all his lands, titles, and honors. He can rule in Winterfell as he pleases. He can even go on calling himself King in the North if he likes, so long as he bends the knee and does me homage as his overlord. King is only a word, but fealty, loyalty, service… those I must have."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="蓝礼耸耸肩。“告诉我，我老哥劳勃有什么权利要求铁王座？”他没有等她回答。“噢，的确人们传说拜拉席恩家族和坦格利安家之间有血亲关系，数百年前的联姻，私生次子和老王的大女儿…除了学士谁在乎这个？不，劳勃得到王座靠的是他的战锤。”他伸出手臂，扫过无边无际的篝火。“是的，这就是我的权利，和劳勃当初一样。如果您儿子象他父亲支持劳勃一般支持我，他将发现我是个慷慨的人。我会乐于承认他的一切领地、头衔和荣誉。只要他高兴，他可以永远统治临冬城。如果他愿意，他甚至可以保留北境之王的称号。只需他向我屈膝臣服，承认我是他的主人。国王的称呼不过就是一句话，而顺从，忠诚，服务…这些才是我的目的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"His claim, you mean?" Renly laughed. "Let us be blunt, my lady. Stannis would make an appalling king. Nor is he like to become one. Men respect Stannis, even fear him, but precious few have ever loved him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“您指的是…他的继承权？”蓝礼大笑。“就让我们直说吧，夫人。史坦尼斯要当上国王那才叫可怕。不，他不适合当国王。人们尊敬他，甚至畏惧他，但没有人喜欢他。”">查看中文翻译</div>
