<div class="line_en">Jill slid the heavy copper crest with the engraved star into its position on the diagram, above the other three openings. It settled into place with a light click, flush against the metal plate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔将刻有星星图案的徽章镶嵌到那块图板上的指定位置，在下面还有三个地方空着。当这块徽章严丝合缝地镶嵌到控制面板上时，发出了“咔嚓”的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The crows had watched her walk through the hall of paintings without moving from their perch, crying out occasionally as she solved the simple puzzle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那群乌鸦站在栖木上没有动，一起看着吉尔在画廊里不停地移动，只是偶尔会鸣叫几声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There had been six portraits in all, cradle to grave -- from a newborn baby to a rather stern-looking old man. She'd assumed they were all of Lord Spencer, though she'd never seen a photo.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在那间画廊里一共有六幅肖像画。从摇篮到坟墓—从新生儿到庄严肃穆的老人。吉尔觉得那些画中的模特一定全部都是斯宾塞，虽然自己从来没有见过他的照片…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When she'd flipped the switch on that one, the painting had actually fallen off the wall, pushed out by tiny metal pegs at each corner. Behind it had been a small, velvet-lined opening that held the copper crest. She'd left the hall without any more trouble; if the birds had been disappointed, she couldn't say.</div>

<div class="line_en">She took a final deep breath of the pleasant night air before going back into the mansion, pulling Trent's computer from her pack as she went. Stepping carefully over the crumpled corpse in the dim hall, she studied the map, deciding where to try next.</div>

<div class="line_en">Back the way she'd come, it looked like. She went back through the double doors that connected the corridors, into the winding, mild, gray-green hall with the landscape paintings. According to the map, the single door just across from her led to a small, square-shaped room which opened into a larger one.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="好像还是回到来时的路比较好。于是穿过一扇朝两边开的门，吉尔回到了那个两旁挂着风景画的灰绿色走廊。根据地图颢示，穿过正前方的那扇门，可以由门后的大房间去到一个四方形的小房间。虽然有些紧张，吉尔还是鼓足勇气握住门把手，稍微一用力将门打开。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tensing, she grabbed the knob and pushed it open, crouching and pointing her Beretta at the same time.</div>

<div class="line_en">Straightening, Jill stepped into the chamber, briefly appraising its simple elegance as she walked toward the door on her right. It had a high, light ceiling and the walls were creamy marble flecked with gold; beautiful. And expensive, to say the least. She felt a vague wistfulness for the old days with Dick, all their grand plans and hopes for each score. This was what real money could buy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔直起身子走了进去。这房间的装饰风格令她赞叹不已，天花板与墙壁都是用奶油色带着金色斑点图案的大理石堆砌而成，实在是太美了。虽然外表看上去极为保守，但估计实际上肯定花了不少钱。吉尔突然回想起自己与父亲迪克在一起的日子，那时他总是制定很大的计划，并成天期待能够成功。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jill didn't know what it was, but she didn't like it. She turned around quickly, searching the room for movement. It was as still as when she'd entered, no screaming birds, no sudden alarms or flashing lights, none of the pictures fell off the wall. There was no trap.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然不知道是什么东西，吉尔还是迅速地转过身去，在房间里四处巡视。可房间还是和她刚进来时一样安静，没有鸣叫的鸟儿，没有突然发出的警报声以及忽明忽暗的灯，也没有从墙上掉下来的画。她没有找到任何类似机关的东西。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As she stopped in front of it, she recognized the make. Guns weren't her strong suit, but it was the same as the S. T. A. R. S. used: a Remington M870, five shots.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当站在散弹枪的前面时，她看出了那支枪的型号。虽然吉尔对于枪械并不算了解，但是挂在墙上的那种散弹枪和S.T。A.R。S所使用的是一样的。电明顿M870，五连发。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a molded fireplace to her right beneath an ornate, red and gold tapestry. A low, modern couch and oval coffee table sat atop a burnt orange carpet of oriental design, and against the back wall -- a pump-action shotgun was mounted on dual hooks, shining in the light from the antique light fixture overhead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在右侧锈着红色与金黄色装饰的挂毯下，有一个暖炉。在一块有着东方风格的橙色绒毯上放着一把靠背很低的现代风格躺椅，还有一张椭圆形的咖啡桌。在房间里面的墙壁上——一把滑杆式散弹枪挂在两根钩子上，在枪的正上方还有专门的灯提供照明。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She bolstered the Beretta and lifted the shotgun with both hands, still grinning -- and the smile dropped away as both mounting hooks clicked upward, released from the weight of the gun. At the same time, there was a heavier sound behind the wall, a sound like balanced metal changing position.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她将贝雷塔收进枪套中，然后笑着伸手将散弹枪取下。这时，从散弹枪的重力之下解脱出来的钩子发出了清脆的“咔嚓”声。于是吉尔的笑容凝固在了脸上，因为在她的身后响起了某种沉重的声音，好像是某种处于平稳状态的金属忽然改变了位置所发出的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was nothing else of interest in the room. Jill walked to the door, excited to get back to the main hall and share her discoveries with Barry. She'd checked out every room that she could open on this side of the first floor. If he'd managed the same, they could head upstairs to finish their search for the Bravos and their missing teammates.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="房间里没有其他能够派上用场的东西，于是吉尔转身走向门口，她想要返回正门的大厅将自己发现的东西和巴瑞分享。别墅一楼自己负责搜索的这边，所有能够打开的门都已经调查过了。“巴瑞大概也在进行同样的工作吧，那么接下来我们两个可以一起去二楼搜索Bravo以及自己小队的其他队员了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She searched the rest of the room and was disappointed not to find any more shells. Still, the Remington was a find. S. T. A. R. S. vests had a back holster for a shotgun or rifle, and although she wasn't that hot with an over-the-shoulder draw, at least she could carry it without tying up her hands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然吉尔在房里的其他地方也仔细地进行了搜索，失望的是并没有找到弹药。算了，至少自己得到了一支雷明顿。S.T。A.R。S的防弹背心后面正好备有一个收纳散弹枪和步枪的枪套。吉尔身上穿着的这件虽然不是最新式的，但至少还能够放下这支散弹枪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She closed the door behind her and strode across the slate-colored tiles of the classy marble room, hoping, as she grasped the knob, that Barry had found Chris and Wesker. They sure didn't come this way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔把门关好，回到了小房间外面的那个由大理石建造而成的奢华房间里。穿过房间，她一边握住门把手，一边想但愿巴瑞能找到克里斯和威斯克，因为目前可以确认那两个人没有到这边来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Relieved, she quickly checked the weapon and found it fully loaded. Someone had taken care of it, the barrel clean and smelling faintly of cleaner and oil; right now, it was about the best smell she could imagine. The solid weight of it in her hands was reassuring, the weight of power.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔松了一口气，接着开始查看散弹枪的状态，果然已经装填好子弹了。好像有人做了保养，枪身很干净，甚至能够闻到润滑剂和清洁剂的气味。在现在这种情况下，这是一种能想象到的最美妙而又最芳香的气味了。这支枪沉甸甸的重量感，无疑能够使人确信其巨大的威力。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The door was locked. Jill frowned, turning the small gold knob back and forth. It rattled a little, but wouldn't give at all. She peered at the crack where the door met the frame, suddenly a little anxious.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="门竟然被锁上了。吉尔的眉毛皱成一团，不管她如何转动那个冰冷的门把手，虽然它也发出了“咔嚓”的声音，但这扇门就是纹丝不动。她看着门的缝隙，忽然感到有些不安。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There it was, by the handle-the thick sliver of steel that indicated a dead-bolt, and a very solid one; the entire area surrounding it was reinforced. But only one keyhole, and that's for the knob…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因为她看到了一根很粗的铜质螺栓。但是锁孔只有一个，是和自己手里的门把连在一起的。那么，现在这根螺栓到底是怎么回事？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="第一轮在门上爆炸，碎片飞了起来，正是她所害怕的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jill raised the shotgun and aimed at the door to the hall, trying not to think about how many shots it would take to blow apart a reinforced steel dead-bolt; it was all she had, the picks wouldn't work on that kind of lock.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔举起散弹枪，瞄准大厅的门，尽量不去想炸开一个加固的钢制死栓需要多少枪；这是她所有的东西，镐不可能用在那种锁上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She fired again, targeting the frame itself. The thunderous shot tore apart wood and chipped marble, but not enough, not even close. The ceiling continued its clattering descent, now less than ten feet above her head. She was going to be crushed to death.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是吉尔再次开火，震耳欲聋的一击将木材轰成碎片，甚至在大理石上穿出一个洞。但是这远远不够，还不足以将螺栓破坏掉。另一方面，天花板还在不断地下降，现在距离吉尔只有不到十英尺了。这样下去的话，她肯定要被压扁了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Panic rising through her system, Jill ran back to the other door, her frightened gaze drawn back to the lowering ceiling. At two to three inches each second, it'd hit the floor in less than a minute.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔意识到这一点之后，急忙跑回到刚才的那扇门前。绝望的目光被一点点落下的天花板所吸引。应该是以每秒二、三厘米的速度在下降。那么说在一分钟之内，天花板将会和地板叠在一起。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The metal plate that supported the bolt extended across half the door. Her mind raced for an answer and came up blank. She didn't have the shells to blow through it and the Beretta carried hollow points, they flattened on impact.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="支撑螺栓的金属板伸出了门的一半。她急忙想得到答案，结果一片空白。她没有炮弹可以炸穿它，贝雷塔身上有空心点，它们在撞击时变平了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was no sense of being watched, of movement in the hall, but someone must have come through while they'd been in the lobby. The thought was disconcerting, reaffirming Chris's uneasy feeling that secret things were happening all around them. The dead creature to their left was in the same position as before, its blood-filled eyes staring blindly at the low ceiling, and Chris wondered again who had killed it. He knew he should examine the corpse and the unsecured area beyond it, but didn't want to go off on his own until he got Rebecca somewhere safe.</div>

<div class="line_en">Someone had rigged all this up in order to keep the medal hidden, so it had to be important-but how was she supposed to remove it? Did the one over the fireplace also reveal a secret passage?</div>
