<div class="line_en">Ellie and Brenda were already fighting about what they were going to wear to church. Since Momma got mad at the preacher three years back, Easter was the only time in the year that the Aarons went to church and it was a big deal. His mother always cried poor, but she put a lot of thought and as much money as she could scrape together into making sure she wouldn't be embarrassed by how her family looked. But the day before she planned to take them all over to Millsburg Plaza for new clothes, his dad came home from Washington early. He'd been laid off. No new clothes this year.</div>

<div class="line_en">Even though it was nearly Easter, there were still very few nights that it was warm enough to leave Miss Bessie out. And then there was the rain. All March it poured. For the first time in many years the creek bed held water, not just a trickle either, enough so that when they swung across, it was a little scary looking down at the rushing water below. Jess took Prince Terrien across inside his jacket, but the puppy was growing so fast he might pop the zipper any time and fall into the water and drown.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管已经快要过复活节了，但是很少有足够温暖的夜晚可以让贝茜小姐呆在外面。而且还有雨。整个三月天都在下着瓢泼大雨。多年来的第一次，河床里有了水。而且不仅仅是涓涓细流，水已经非常多了，以至于在荡过小溪时，向下看着奔腾的河水会让人害怕。每次，杰斯都把泰伦王子裹在他的夹克里荡过河去。然而小狗长得飞快，它很有可能挤破拉链，掉到河里淹死。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Leslie looked decent. Her hair was kind of slicked down, and she wore a navy-blue jumper over a blouse with tiny old-fashioned-looking flowers. At the bottom of her red knee socks were a pair of shiny brown leather shoes that Jess had never seen before as Leslie always wore sneakers like the rest of the kids in Lark Creek. Even her manner was decent. Her usual sparkle was toned way down, and she said "Yes'm" and "No'm" to his mother just as though she were aware of Mrs. Aaron's dread of disrespect. Jess knew how hard Leslie must be trying, for Leslie didn't say "ma'am" naturally.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱斯利看起来的确得体。她的头发梳理得整齐又光滑，穿着一件深蓝色的连衣裙，外面套了一件点缀着老式小花的上衣。在她红色的膝长盖袜下面是一双闪亮的棕色毛皮鞋，杰斯从未见过她穿这双鞋，因为莱斯利跟云雀溪的其他小孩儿一样，总是穿着运动鞋。就连她的举止也显得端庄有礼。她往常热情奔放的言语不见了，相反，她总是对他的妈妈说“是的，夫人”和“不是，夫人”，就像她已经察觉到艾伦斯夫人对于失礼的恐惧。杰斯明白莱斯利有多努力，因为莱斯利说“夫人”时并不自然。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They were a little late, which didn't bother Ellie and Brenda for it meant that they got to flounce down the entire length of the aisle to the first pew, making sure that every eye in the church was on them, and every expression of every eye a jealous one. Lord, they were disgusting. And his mother had been scared Leslie might embarrass her. Jess hunched his shoulders and slunk into the pew after the string of womenfolks and just before his dad.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们已经有点儿晚了，不过这并没有让艾丽和布兰达觉得烦恼，因为这意味着她们要走过整个通道去坐到第一排的长椅上，让她们确信教堂里的每一双眼睛都集中在她们身上，而且每一双眼睛里都透着嫉妒。天啊，她们真恶心。他的妈妈则害怕莱斯利会让她难堪。在女士们的弦乐演奏之后，杰斯缩着肩，悄悄溜到座位上，正好在他的爸爸前面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The sun wasn't exactly shining, but it was the first day in so long that the rain wasn't actually coming down that they sang "O Lord, What a Morning," "Ah, Lovely Meadows," and "Sing! Sing a Song" that Miss Edmunds had taught them, and even "Jingle Bells" for Joyce Ann. The wind carried their voices away from them. It made the music seem mysterious, which filled Jess with a feeling of power over the hills rolling out from behind the truck. The ride was much too short, especially for Joyce Ann, who began to cry because the arrival interrupted the first verse of "Santa Claus Is Coming to Town," which after "Jingle Bells" was her favorite song. Jess tickled her to get her giggling again, so that when the four of them clambered down over the tail gate, they were flushed-faced and happy once more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="太阳并不明亮，但这是最近很长一段时间以来第一个没有下雨的天。因此他们唱了艾徳梦丝小姐教他们的“哦主啊，多么美好的清晨”，“啊，可爱的牧场”，还有“唱吧！唱首歌”，甚至还为乔伊丝·安唱了“铃儿响叮当”。风把他们的歌声带向了远方。这让音乐变得有些玄妙，杰斯心中充满了了一种从卡车后面奔涌而出的力量。整个旅途太短暂了。对于乔伊丝·安来说则更是这样。她在到达目的地时哭了起来，因为这打断了“圣诞老人进城来”的第一节，而这首歌是仅次于“铃儿响叮当”的她最喜欢的歌。杰斯胳肢她让她又笑了起来，所以当他们四个从卡车的后拦板爬下来时，他们都又是既兴奋又高兴。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The preacher had one of those tricky voices. It would buzz along for several minutes quite comfortably, then bang! he was screaming at you. Each time Jess would jump, and it would take another couple of minutes to relax again. Because he wasn't listening to the words, the man's red face with sweat pouring down seemed strangely out of place in the dull sanctuary. It was like Brenda throwing a tantrum over Joyce Ann touching her lipstick.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="牧师有一种难以捉摸的说话方式。他可能先让人听着舒服地嗡嗡说上几分钟，然后嘭！他朝着你尖叫。每一次他这么做时，杰斯总会跳起来，然后又花上两分钟才能再次放松下来。因为他没有在听他到底说的什么，所以那个人涨得通红、挂满汗珠的脸和这无趣的圣所显得格格不入。就像布兰达由于乔伊丝·安动了她的口红而发脾气一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
