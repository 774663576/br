<div class="line_en">Richie's truck was in the driveway, but the whole house was dark, thank God. Eleanor was sure that something would give her away. Her hair. Her shirt. Her mouth. She felt radioactive.</div>

<div class="line_en">Park must be feeling strange, too. He sat through two Bon Jovi songs without even touching the radio. Eleanor had left a mark on his shoulder, but you couldn't see it anymore.</div>

<div class="line_en">She and Park had been sitting in the alley for a while, in the front seat, just holding hands and feeling whiplashed. At least, that's how Eleanor felt. It wasn't that she and Park had gone too far, necessarily -- but they'd gone a whole lot farther than she'd been prepared for. She'd never expected to have a love scene straight out of a Judy Blume book.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她和帕克在巷子里停了一会儿，两人在前座手牵手，觉得如遭鞭笞。至少这是埃莉诺的感受。倒不是他们干了什么太出格的事，但比她预想中要出格。她并没有预期要上演茱蒂·布伦（115）小说里的场景。【注：（115）茱蒂·布伦（Judy Blume），美国青少年文学作家，经常探讨具有争议性的话题。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">If Eleanor were allowed to have normal relationships with boys, she wouldn't have felt like she had to hit a home run the very first time she ended up in the back seat of a car -- she wouldn't have felt like it might be her only time at bat. (And she wouldn't be making these stupid baseball metaphors.)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果她允许埃莉诺和男孩正常交往，她绝对不会第一次跟男生待在车后座，就觉得非得挥个全垒打不可，不会觉得这可能是她唯一挥棒的机会。（更不会拿这些愚蠢的棒球术语来做比喻。）">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It hadn't been a home run, anyway. They'd stopped at second base. (At least, she thought it was second base. She'd heard conflicting definitions for the bases.) Still…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="反正也称不上直攻本垒。他们在二垒就刹车了。（至少她认为那是二垒。至于哪一垒是什么程度，众说纷纭。）但是它依然…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Goodbye," she said, shaking her head. "I'll see you tomorrow." She opened the door to the Impala; it weighed as much as a horse. Then she stopped and looked back at him. "But we're okay, right?"</div>

<div class="line_en">All the little kids were on the floor, even Maisie. They were sleeping through the chaos. I wonder how often I sleep through it. Eleanor thought. She managed to swing onto her bed without stepping on anybody, but she landed on the cat. He squawked, and she pulled him up and onto her lap. "Shhh," she breathed, scratching his neck.</div>

<div class="line_en">She reached under her leg and pulled out a badly crumpled comic book. An X-Men annual. Damn it, Ben. She tried to smooth the comic out on her lap, but it was covered in some goop. The blanket felt wet, too, it was lotion or something… No, liquid makeup. With little bits of broken glass. Eleanor carefully picked a shard out of the cat's tail and set it aside, then wiped her wet fingers on his fur. A length of oily-brown cassette tape was wrapped around his leg. Eleanor pulled it free. She looked down the bed and blinked until her eyes adjusted to the dark…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她手伸到大腿下，拉出一本皱巴巴的漫画，是《X战警年刊》。糟了。班恩。她把漫画放在大腿上，试图抚平书页，书上好像涂了什么黏乎乎的东西。她的毯子也湿湿的，是乳液之类的东西…不，是化妆水。地上还有玻璃碎片。她小心地捡起猫尾巴上的玻璃碎片，放到一旁，在猫身上抹了抹湿漉漉的手。一长条油腻的磁带卷在它的腿上。埃莉诺把磁带拉开，低头看床，眨眨眼，让眼睛适应黑暗。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Her headphones were snapped in half and hanging from the edge of the bunk. Her grapefruit box was at the end of the bed, and Eleanor knew before she reached for it that it would be light as air. Empty. The lid was ripped almost in half, and someone had written on it in bold black marker -- with one of Eleanor's markers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的耳机被掰成两截挂在床边。她的葡萄柚盒子跑到了床脚，埃莉诺不用打开就知道，它轻飘飘的，已经空空如也了。盒盖几乎被撕成两半，有人用埃莉诺的黑色签字笔在盒盖上写着：">查看中文翻译</div>
