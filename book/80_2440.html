<div class="line_en">"Being occasionally at the camp at Frederic a few days since, I found the general and officers extremely exasperated on account of their not being supplied with horses and carriages, which had been expected from this province, as most able to furnish them; but, through the dissensions between our governor and Assembly, money had not been provided, nor any steps taken for that purpose.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I apprehended that the progress of British soldiers through these counties on such an occasion, especially considering the temper they are in, and their resentment against us, would be attended with many and great inconveniences to the inhabitants, and therefore more willingly took the trouble of trying first what might be done by fair and equitable means. The people of these back counties have lately complained to the Assembly that a sufficient currency was wanting; you have an opportunity of receiving and dividing among you a very considerable sum; for, if the service of this expedition should continue, as it is more than probable it will, for one hundred and twenty days, the hire of these waggons and horses will amount to upward of thirty thousand pounds, which will be paid you in silver and gold of the king's money.</div>

The king's business must be done; so many brave troops, come so far for your defense, must not stand idle through your backwardness to do what may be reasonably expected from you; waggons and horses must be had; violent measures will probably be used, and you will be left to seek for a recompense where you can find it, and your case, perhaps, be little pitied or regarded.</div>

<div class="line_en">I received of the general about eight hundred pounds, to be disbursed in advance-money to the waggon owners, etc.; but, that sum being insufficient, I advanc'd upward of two hundred pounds more, and in two weeks the one hundred and fifty waggons, with two hundred and fifty-nine carrying horses, were on their march for the camp. The advertisement promised payment according to the valuation, in case any waggon or horse should be lost. The owners, however, alleging they did not know General Braddock, or what dependence might be had on his promise, insisted on my bond for the performance, which I accordingly gave them.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I have no particular interest in this affair, as, except the satisfaction of endeavoring to do good, I shall have only my labour for my pains. If this method of obtaining the waggons and horses is not likely to succeed, I am obliged to send word to the general in fourteen days; and I suppose Sir John St. Clair, the hussar, with a body of soldiers, will immediately enter the province for the purpose, which I shall be sorry to hear, because I am very sincerely and truly your friend and well-wisher, B.

<div class="line_en">While I was at the camp, supping one evening with the officers of Colonel Dunbar's regiment, he represented to me his concern for the subalterns, who, he said, were generally not in affluence, and could ill afford, in this dear country, to lay in the stores that might be necessary in so long a march, thro' a wilderness, where nothing was to be purchas'd. I commiserated their case, and resolved to endeavor procuring them some relief. I said nothing, however, to him of my intention, but wrote the next morning to the committee of the Assembly, who had the disposition of some public money, warmly recommending the case of these officers to their consideration, and proposing that a present should be sent them of necessaries and refreshments. My son, who had some experience of a camp life, and of its wants, drew up a list for me, which I enclos'd in my letter. The committee approv'd, and used such diligence that, conducted by my son, the stores arrived at the camp as soon as the waggons.</div>

I undertook this also, and was busily employ'd in it till we heard of his defeat, advancing for the service of my own money, upwards of one thousand pounds sterling, of which I sent him an account. It came to his hands, luckily for me, a few days before the battle, and he return'd me immediately an order on the paymaster for the round sum of one thousand pounds, leaving the remainder to the next account.

<div class="line_en">In conversation with him one day, he was giving me some account of his intended progress. "After taking Fort Duquesne," says he, "I am to proceed to Niagara; and, having taken that, to Frontenac, if the season will allow time; and I suppose it will, for Duquesne can hardly detain me above three or four days; and then I see nothing that can obstruct my march to Niagara." Having before revolv'd in my mind the long line his army must make in their march by a very narrow road, to be cut for them thro' the woods and bushes, and also what I had read of a former defeat of fifteen hundred French, who invaded the Iroquois country, I had conceiv'd some doubts and some fears for the event of the campaign. But I ventur'd only to say, "To be sure, sir, if you arrive well before Duquesne, with these fine troops, so well provided with artillery, that place not yet compleatly fortified, and as we hear with no very strong garrison, can probably make but a short resistance. The only danger I apprehend of obstruction to your march is from ambuscades of Indians, who, by constant practice, are dexterous in laying and executing them; and the slender line, near four miles long, which your army must make, may expose it to be attack'd by surprise in its flanks, and to be cut like a thread into several pieces, which, from their distance, can not come up in time to support each other."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一天，我跟他谈话，他稍稍告诉我他进军的计划，他说：“攻下了度垦堡以后，我将直捣尼加拉；攻下尼加拉以后，如果季节还不太晚的话，我将进取方替耐克。我想季节一定不会太晚，因为度垦堡阻拦不了我们三四天，度垦堡一下，我就不知道有什么东西可以拦阻我进攻尼加拉了。”在这以前我老早就认为，当他的军队在一条羊肠小道中进军时，他必然要把队伍拉得很长，而这条小道就可以因森林和丛林而被切断，我也想到我曾经读到过，前一次有一千五百个侵入伊洛奎印第安人地区的法国人遭到了失败，因此我有点怀疑，同时我也替这次出征捏一把汗。但是我鼓足勇气只敢说：“当然喽，将军大人，如果你带着一支有这么多大炮配备的优秀部队安全地到达度垦堡，因为度垦堡的防御工程尚未完成，而且听说驻军人数也不多，所以一定指日可下。但是我担心的只是印第安人的埋伏可能阻碍你的进军。印第安人对于埋伏行之有素，因此在掩护和偷袭方面都是十分巧妙敏捷的。你的军队的行军行列必然拉得很长，几乎有四英里之远，这样它可能遭受到从侧面来的突击，可能被切成几段。由于距离过远，被切断的部分不可能及时地相互支援。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This general was, I think, a brave man, and might probably have made a figure as a good officer in some European war. But he had too much self-confidence, too high an opinion of the validity of regular troops, and too mean a one of both Americans and Indians. George Croghan, our Indian interpreter, join'd him on his march with one hundred of those people, who might have been of great use to his army as guides, scouts, etc., if he had treated them kindly; but he slighted and neglected them, and they gradually left him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这位将军我倒以为是一个勇敢的人，在某些欧洲的战争中他很可能成为一位优秀军官。但是他的自信力太强，对于正规军队的作战力量估计过高，对于美洲殖民地人民和印第安人两者估计过低。我们的印第安语翻译乔治·克罗干带了一百名印第安人参加了他的进军，这些印第安人，如果他好好地待他们，可能作为向导、侦察兵等，对他的军队大有用处，但是他看不起他们，怠慢了他们，所以后来他们慢慢地离开了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He smil'd at my ignorance, and reply'd, "These savages may, indeed, be a formidable enemy to your raw American militia, but upon the king's regular and disciplin'd troops, sir, it is impossible they should make any impression." I was conscious of an impropriety in my disputing with a military man in matters of his profession, and said no more. The enemy, however, did not take the advantage of his army which I apprehended its long line of march expos'd it to, but let it advance without interruption till within nine miles of the place; and then, when more in a body (for it had just passed a river, where the front had halted till all were come over), and in a more open part of the woods than any it had pass'd, attack'd its advanced guard by a heavy fire from behind trees and bushes, which was the first intelligence the general had of an enemy's being near him. This guard being disordered, the general hurried the troops up to their assistance, which was done in great confusion, thro' waggons, baggage, and cattle; and presently the fire came upon their flank: the officers, being on horseback, were more easily distinguish'd, pick'd out as marks, and fell very fast; and the soldiers were crowded together in a huddle, having or hearing no orders, and standing to be shot at till two-thirds of them were killed; and then, being seiz'd with a panick, the whole fled with precipitation.</div>

<div class="line_en">The waggoners took each a horse out of his team and scamper'd; their example was immediately followed by others; so that all the waggons, provisions, artillery, and stores were left to the enemy. The general, being wounded, was brought off with difficulty; his secretary, Mr. Shirley, was killed by his side; and out of eighty-six officers, sixty-three were killed or wounded, and seven hundred and fourteen men killed out of eleven hundred. These eleven hundred had been picked men from the whole army; the rest had been left behind with Colonel Dunbar, who was to follow with the heavier part of the stores, provisions, and baggage. The flyers, not being pursu'd, arriv'd at Dunbar's camp, and the panick they brought with them instantly seiz'd him and all his people; and, tho' he had now above one thousand men, and the enemy who bad beaten Braddock did not at most exceed four hundred Indians and French together, instead of proceeding, and endeavoring to recover some of the lost honour, he ordered all the stores, ammunition, etc., to be destroy'd, that he might have more horses to assist his flight towards the settlements, and less lumber to remove. He was there met with requests from the governors of Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania, that he would post his troops on the frontiers, so as to afford some protection to the inhabitants; but he continu'd his hasty march thro' all the country, not thinking himself safe till he arriv'd at Philadelphia, where the inhabitants could protect him. This whole transaction gave us Americans the first suspicion that our exalted ideas of the prowess of British regulars had not been well founded.</div>

<div class="line_en">In their first march, too, from their landing till they got beyond the settlements, they had plundered and stripped the inhabitants, totally ruining some poor families, besides insulting, abusing, and confining the people if they remonstrated. This was enough to put us out of conceit of such defenders, if we had really wanted any. How different was the conduct of our French friends in 1781, who, during a march thro' the most inhabited part of our country from Rhode Island to Virginia, near seven hundred miles, occasioned not the smallest complaint for the loss of a pig, a chicken, or even an apple.</div>

This he readily granted, and several were accordingly return'd to their masters, on my application. Dunbar, when the command devolv'd on him, was not so generous. He being at Philadelphia, on his retreat, or rather flight, I apply'd to him for the discharge of the servants of three poor farmers of Lancaster county that he had enlisted, reminding him of the late general's orders on that bead. He promised me that, if the masters would come to him at Trenton, where he should be in a few days on his march to New York, he would there deliver their men to them.

David Hume, too, who was some years after secretary to Lord Hertford, when minister in France, and afterward to General Conway, when secretary of state, told me he had seen among the papers in that office, letters from Braddock highly recommending me.

The Assembly, however, continu'd firm, believing they had justice on their side, and that it would be giving up an essential right if they suffered the governor to amend their money-bills. In one of the last, indeed, which was for granting fifty thousand pounds, his propos'd amendment was only of a single word. The bill expressed "that all estates, real and personal, were to be taxed, those of the proprietaries not excepted." His amendment was, for not read only: a small, but very material alteration. However, when the news of this disaster reached England, our friends there, whom we had taken care to furnish with all the Assembly's answers to the governor's messages, rais'd a clamor against the proprietaries for their meanness and injustice in giving their governor such instructions; some going so far as to say that, by obstructing the defense of their province, they forfeited their right to it.

I was surprised to find it in so good a posture of defense; the destruction of Gnadenhut had made them apprehend danger. The principal buildings were defended by a stockade; they had purchased a quantity of arms and ammunition from New York, and had even plac'd quantities of small paving stones between the windows of their high stone houses, for their women to throw down upon the heads of any Indians that should attempt to force into them. The armed brethren, too, kept watch, and reliev'd as methodically as in any garrison town. In conversation with the bishop, Spangenberg, I mention'd this my surprise; for, knowing they had obtained an act of Parliament exempting them from military duties in the colonies, I had suppos'd they were conscientiously scrupulous of bearing arms. He answer'd me that it was not one of their established principles, but that, at the time of their obtaining that act, it was thought to be a principle with many of their people. On this occasion, however, they, to their surprise, found it adopted by but a few.

Our axes, of which we had seventy, were immediately set to work to cut down trees, and, our men being dextrous in the use of them, great despatch was made. Seeing the trees fall so fast, I had the curiosity to look at my watch when two men began to cut at a pine; in six minutes they had it upon the ground, and I found it of fourteen inches diameter. Each pine made three palisades of eighteen feet long, pointed at one end. While these were preparing, our other men dug a trench all round, of three feet deep, in which the palisades were to be planted; and, our waggons, the bodys being taken off, and the fore and hind wheels separated by taking out the pin which united the two parts of the perch, we had ten carriages, with two horses each, to bring the palisades from the woods to the spot. When they were set up, our carpenters built a stage of boards all round within, about six feet high, for the men to stand on when to fire thro' the loopholes. We had one swivel gun, which we mounted on one of the angles, and fir'd it as soon as fix'd, to let the Indians know, if any were within hearing, that we had such pieces; and thus our fort, if such a magnificent name may be given to so miserable a stockade, was finish'd in a week, though it rain'd so hard every other day that the men could not work.</div>

Finding ourselves now posted securely, and having a place to retreat to on occasion, we ventur'd out in parties to scour the adjacent country. We met with no Indians, but we found the places on the neighboring hills where they had lain to watch our proceedings. There was an art in their contrivance of those places, that seems worth mention. It being winter, a fire was necessary for them; but a common fire on the surface of the ground would by its light have discovered their position at a distance. They had therefore dug holes in the ground about three feet diameter, and somewhat deeper; we saw where they had with their hatchets cut off the charcoal from the sides of burnt logs lying in the woods. With these coals they had made small fires in the bottom of the holes, and we observ'd among the weeds and grass the prints of their bodies, made by their laying all round, with their legs hanging down in the holes to keep their feet warm, which, with them, is an essential point. This kind of fire, so manag'd, could not discover them, either by its light, flame, sparks, or even smoke: it appear'd that their number was not great, and it seems they saw we were too many to be attacked by them with prospect of advantage.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="这一工作刚完成，我在炮台里刚贮备了充分的粮秣以后，我接到了州长的一封来信，告诉我他已经召集了州议会，要我去参加会议，假如边境的形势不需要我再在那里的话。我在州议会里的友人们也来信劝我去开会，如果可能的话。现在我的三个炮台既然已经修建完毕了，居民们在炮台的保护之下也安心地留在自己的农场里了，我就决心回去。更高兴的是一个新英格兰的军官，叫做柯赖班上校，对于与印第安人战争颇有经验，刚巧到我们的地方来访问，同意担任指挥官的职务。我给他一张委任状，在检阅驻军时，我向全军宣读委任状，并把他介绍给全体士兵，我认为由于他的军事技能，他比我更适宜于做他们的指挥官。对他们讲了几句劝勉的话以后，我就离开了。他们护送我到伯利恒，在这里我小住了几天，消除疲劳，当我第一夜睡在一张舒适的床上时，我简直无法入睡，因为这与裹着一两条毯子睡在我们纳登荷木屋里的地板上，有天壤之别。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We had for our chaplain a zealous Presbyterian minister, Mr. Beatty, who complained to me that the men did not generally attend his prayers and exhortations. When they enlisted, they were promised, besides pay and provisions, a gill of rum a day, which was punctually serv'd out to them, half in the morning, and the other half in the evening; and I observ'd they were as punctual in attending to receive it; upon which I said to Mr. Beatty, "It is, perhaps, below the dignity of your profession to act as steward of the rum, but if you were to deal it out and only just after prayers, you would have them all about you." He liked the tho't, undertook the office, and, with the help of a few hands to measure out the liquor, executed it to satisfaction, and never were prayers more generally and more punctually attended; so that I thought this method preferable to the punishment inflicted by some military laws for non-attendance on divine service.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们有一个热心的长老会牧师俾替先生充当我们的军中牧师，他向我抱怨说，士兵们一般不来参加祈祷会，不来听他的训诫。当他们应征时，除了饷银和伙食外，我们还答应每天给他们一及耳甜酒，我们按时发酒给他们喝，一半在上午，一半在晚上。我发现他们来喝酒倒是十分按时的。因此我跟俾替说：“作为一个牧师，要你去管理甜酒或许是有点屈尊，但是如果你等到祈祷会完毕后才发酒，他们都会来的。”他觉得这办法不错，接受了这个职位，有几个人帮他斟酒，这事进行得很顺利，祈祷会从未有过这样座无虚席、按时不误的情形，因此我认为与其用军法来处罚那些不参加礼拜仪式的人，倒不如用这种方法为妥。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">While at Bethlehem, I inquir'd a little into the practice of the Moravians: some of them had accompanied me, and all were very kind to me. I found they work'd for a common stock, eat at common tables, and slept in common dormitories, great numbers together. In the dormitories I observed loopholes, at certain distances all along just under the ceiling, which I thought judiciously placed for change of air. I was at their church, where I was entertain'd with good musick, the organ being accompanied with violins, hautboys, flutes, clarinets, etc. I understood that their sermons were not usually preached to mixed congregations of men, women, and children, as is our common practice, but that they assembled sometimes the married men, at other times their wives, then the young men, the young women, and the little children, each division by itself. The sermon I heard was to the latter, who came in and were plac'd in rows on benches; the boys under the conduct of a young man, their tutor, and the girls conducted by a young woman. The discourse seem'd well adapted to their capacities, and was deliver'd in a pleasing, familiar manner, coaxing them, as it were, to be good. They behav'd very orderly, but looked pale and unhealthy, which made me suspect they were kept too much within doors, or not allow'd sufficient exercise.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在逗留伯利恒期间，我稍稍了解一下弟兄派教友的风尚。有几个弟兄派教友一直陪着我，所有的弟兄派教友都对我十分客气。我发现他们实行共产，伙食是集体的，许许多多人一起睡在集体宿舍里。我在宿舍里看到在靠近天花板处的四围墙上每隔一定的距离开一个气孔。我认为这些气孔为了流通空气，开在上端，是很适宜的，我参加了他们的礼拜仪式，当时我听到了优美的音乐，感到快慰，他们用提琴、箫、横笛、竖笛等乐器来伴奏风琴。我知道他们讲道时，不像我们平常那样，对男女老少混合的会众讲的，他们有时候召集已婚的男子，有时候召集他们的妻子，有时未婚青年男子、未婚青年女子和儿童分头集会。我曾听过他们向儿童说教。男孩由一个青年男子（他们的导师）带领，女孩由一个青年妇女带领进入会场，排队依次坐在凳子上。所讲的内容似乎颇适合他们的水平，讲时用一种亲切愉快的口吻，仿佛诱哄他们做乖孩子似的。他们的纪律颇好，但是似乎面色苍白，健康欠佳。我猜想他们被关在屋子里的时间太多了，或是运动太少了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I inquir'd concerning the Moravian marriages, whether the report was true that they were by lot. I was told that lots were us'd only in particular cases; that generally, when a young man found himself dispos'd to marry, he inform'd the elders of his class, who consulted the elder ladies that govern'd the young women. As these elders of the different sexes were well acquainted with the tempers and dispositions of their respective pupils, they could best judge what matches were suitable, and their judgments were generally acquiesc'd in; but if, for example, it should happen that two or three young women were found to be equally proper for the young man, the lot was then recurred to. I objected, if the matches are not made by the mutual choice of the parties, some of them may chance to be very unhappy. "And so they may," answer'd my informer, "if you let the parties chuse for themselves;" which, indeed, I could not deny.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我调查了弟兄派的婚姻习惯，想弄清楚他们是否像传说那样用抽签方式决定配偶的。他们告诉我只是在特殊情况下他们才用抽签来决定。在一般情况下，当一个青年男子打算结婚时，他就告诉他班上的长辈们，他们又跟那些管理青年女子的老年妇女商量，由于这些男女长辈们对于他们各人自己学生的性情脾气都很熟悉，他们最能判断谁配谁最合适，平常男女双方总是同意他们的决定的，但是比方说，假如他们认为有两三个青年女子都同样地适合一个青年男子，那时才使用抽签的办法。我提出了反对的意见说，如果婚姻不是由当事人自愿选择，他们当中可能有人会感到不满。告诉我这件事的人回答说：“就是你让当事人自己选择，他们也可能会产生不满。”这一点事实上我也无法否认。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Being returned to Philadelphia, I found the association went on swimmingly, the inhabitants that were not Quakers having pretty generally come into it, formed themselves into companies, and chose their captains, lieutenants, and ensigns, according to the new law. Dr. B. visited me, and gave me an account of the pains he had taken to spread a general good liking to the law, and ascribed much to those endeavors. I had had the vanity to ascribe all to my Dialogue; however, not knowing but that he might be in the right, I let him enjoy his opinion, which I take to be generally the best way in such cases. The officers, meeting, chose me to be colonel of the regiment, which I this time accepted. I forget how many companies we had, but we paraded about twelve hundred well-looking men, with a company of artillery, who had been furnished with six brass field-pieces, which they had become so expert in the use of as to fire twelve times in a minute. The first time I reviewed my regiment they accompanied me to my house, and would salute me with some rounds fired before my door, which shook down and broke several glasses of my electrical apparatus. And my new honour proved not much less brittle; for all our commissions were soon after broken by a repeal of the law in England.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="回到了费城以后，我看到团练的事情进行得很顺利，除了教友会教友以外，其余的居民几乎全都加入了，他们按照新的法律把自己组成许多中队，选出了他们的上尉、中尉和少尉。B博士来看我，告诉我他在宣扬有关团练法律方面所做的努力，并且说这种努力有了重大的成就。在这以前我自己以为这一法律的通过全由于我的那篇《对话》。但是我想他所说的或许也有道理，所以我就让他保持他的意见。我想在这种情况下一般说来这是最好的办法。团练的军官们开会时，选举我做团队的团长，这一次我接受了这一职位，我忘了我们一共组织了多少中队，但是我们有一千两百个雄赳赳的战士列队游行，还有一中队的炮兵，他们带有六门铜质野战炮，他们使用这种野炮颇为纯熟，每分钟能发十二炮。在我第一次检阅了我的团队以后，炮兵们送我到家，坚持要在我家门口放几个礼炮，对我致敬，炮弹把我电学仪器上的几块玻璃震下来摔破了。事实上我的新荣誉也跟这些玻璃差不多一样地脆弱，因为不久以后英国政府废除了我们的团练法，我们的军衔也接着被撤销了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">During this short time of my colonelship, being about to set out on a journey to Virginia, the officers of my regiment took it into their heads that it would be proper for them to escort me out of town, as far as the Lower Ferry. Just as I was getting on horseback they came to my door, between thirty and forty, mounted, and all in their uniforms. I had not been previously acquainted with the project, or I should have prevented it, being naturally averse to the assuming of state on any occasion; and I was a good deal chagrin'd at their appearance, as I could not avoid their accompanying me. What made it worse was, that, as soon as we began to move, they drew their swords and rode with them naked all the way. Somebody wrote an account of this to the proprietor, and it gave him great offense. No such honor had been paid him when in the province, nor to any of his governors; and he said it was only proper to princes of the blood royal, which may be true for aught I know, who was, and still am, ignorant of the etiquette in such cases.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在我充当团长的短短时期中，有一次在我将出发到弗吉尼亚旅行之前，我团队中的军官们认为他们应当护送我出城直到下渡口。当我正在上马时，他们三四十个人，骑着马全体穿着军服，来到我的门前。事前我对他们的计划一无所知，否则我会加以劝阻，因为我生性不喜欢在任何场合摆威风。他们来了，我真十分懊恨，因为我这时无法使他们不护送我了。使事情更糟的是：当我们开始移动时，他们拔出了他们的指挥刀，一路上骑着马露刃前进。有人替这件事写了一个报告寄给业主，他大为不乐。当他在宾夕法尼亚州时，他从来没有受过这样隆重的敬礼，他的州长们也从未享受这样的敬意。他说只有王室的亲王才配受这样的敬礼。这也许是真的，但是我不大知道。无论是过去或现在，对这种事情的礼节我都是外行。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This silly affair, however, greatly increased his rancour against me, which was before not a little, on account of my conduct in the Assembly respecting the exemption of his estate from taxation, which I had always oppos'd very warmly, and not without severe reflections on his meanness and injustice of contending for it. He accused me to the ministry as being the great obstacle to the king's service, preventing, by my influence in the House, the proper form of the bills for raising money, and he instanced this parade with my officers as a proof of my having an intention to take the government of the province out of his hands by force. He also applied to Sir Everard Fawkener, the postmaster-general, to deprive me of my office; but it had no other effect than to procure from Sir Everard a gentle admonition.</div>
