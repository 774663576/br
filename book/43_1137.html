<div class="line_en">"Here!" answered a husky voice from above, and, running up, Meg found her sister eating apples and crying over the Heir of Redclyffe, wrapped up in a comforter on an old three-legged sofa by the sunny window. This was Jo's favorite refuge, and here she loved to retire with half a dozen russets and a nice book, to enjoy the quiet and the society of a pet rat who lived near by and didn't mind her a particle. As Meg appeared, Scrabble whisked into his hole. Jo shook the tears off her cheeks and waited to hear the news.</div>

<div class="line_en">On New Year's Eve the parlor was deserted, for the two younger girls played dressing maids and the two elder were absorbed in the all-important business of 'getting ready for the party'. Simple as the toilets were, there was a great deal of running up and down, laughing and talking, and at one time a strong smell of burned hair pervaded the house. Meg wanted a few curls about her face, and Jo undertook to pinch the papered locks with a pair of hot tongs.</div>

<div class="line_en">After various lesser mishaps, Meg was finished at last, and by the united exertions of the entire family Jo's hair was got up and her dress on.

<div class="line_en">Down they went, feeling a trifle timid, for they seldom went to parties, and informal as this little gathering was, it was an event to them. Mrs. Gardiner, a stately old lady, greeted them kindly and handed them over to the eldest of her six daughters. Meg knew Sallie and was at her ease very soon, but Jo, who didn't care much for girls or girlish gossip, stood about, with her back carefully against the wall, and felt as much out of place as a colt in a flower garden. Half a dozen jovial lads were talking about skates in another part of the room, and she longed to go and join them, for skating was one of the joys of her life. She telegraphed her wish to Meg, but the eyebrows went up so alarmingly that she dared not stir. No one came to talk to her, and one by one the group dwindled away till she was left alone. She could not roam about and amuse herself, for the burned breadth would show, so she stared at people rather forlornly till the dancing began. Meg was asked at once, and the tight slippers tripped about so briskly that none would have guessed the pain their wearer suffered smilingly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="姐妹两人略带羞怯地走过去。虽然这只是个非正式的小舞会，对于她们来说却是件盛事。加德纳夫人是位神态庄重的老太太，有六个女儿。她和霭可亲地接待了她们，并把她们交给大女儿莎莉。梅格和莎莉相熟，很快便不再拘束，而乔呢，对女孩子和女孩子的闲言碎语一向不大着意，只得站在那里，小心翼翼地背靠着墙，觉得自己就像一匹关在花园里的小野马，很不得要领。五六个快活的小伙子在房间的另一头大谈溜冰，她心痒难禁，恨不得也走过去参与，因为溜冰是她生活中的一大乐趣。她把心头愿望向梅格流露，但梅格的眉毛抬得老高，令她不敢轻举妄动。没有人过来跟他说话；身边的一群人也渐走渐少，最后只剩下她孤零零一个。因为怕露出烧坏了的衣幅，她不敢四处走动去寻找乐趣，只能可怜巴巴地站在那里盯着别人看。这时舞曲响起，梅格马上被请进了舞池。她步态轻快，笑脸盈盈，没有人会想象得到她双脚正被那双鞋子折磨得生疼。">查看中文翻译</div>
