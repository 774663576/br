<div class="line_en">Jacob started pulling the first bike -- the red one, which was destined for me -- to pieces immediately. He opened up the passenger door of the Rabbit so I could sit on the seat instead of the ground. While he worked, Jacob chattered happily, needing only the lightest of nudges from me to keep the conversation rolling. He updated me on the progress of his sophomore year of school, running on about his classes and his two best friends.</div>

The shorter boy was more burly. His white T-shirt strained over his well-developed chest, and he seemed gleefully conscious of that fact. His hair was so short it was almost a buzz.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="奎尔和恩布里，我还不知道他们谁是谁，意味深长的交换了一下眼神。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Bella and I are going to fix up these bikes," Jacob explained inaccurately. But bikes seemed to be the magic word.

<div class="line_cn" title="“贝拉和我正要修理这些车，”雅各布不准确的解释到。但是车好像是个具有魔力的词语。他们都跑去检查雅各布的工作，用一些专业的词语询问他。他们用的很多词对我来说都很陌生，我发现我只有拥有了Y染色体才能真正明白他们为什么那么兴奋了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Last night I had not been alone in the woods. Sam Uley -- the man who had pulled me from the forest floor that night I couldn't bear to think of consciously -- was there. It was an odd, unexpected alteration. The man's dark eyes had been surprisingly unfriendly, filled with some secret he didn't seem inclined to share. I'd stared at him as often as my frantic searching had allowed; it made me uncomfortable, under all the usual panic, to have him there. Maybe that was because, when I didn't look directly at him, his shape seemed to shiver and change in my peripheral vision. Yet he did nothing but stand and watch. Unlike the time when we had met in reality, he did not offer me his help.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="昨晚我不是一人在树林里。山姆。乌利——那晚把我从森林里的地上拉起来的男人，我无法忍受自己有意识的去想它——他也在那里。这是一个奇怪的、出乎意料的改变。这个男人的黑眼睛看起来让人惊讶的不友好，好像装满了他看起来不打算和别人分享的秘密。我疯狂的寻找着，然后尽一切可能的盯着他，我和平常一样恐慌，而他在那让我非常不安。也许因为当我没有直视他时，我的余光可以看到他的身体好像在颤抖和变化。即使他什么都没做只是站在那看着我。和我们在现实生活中相遇的时候不同，他没有为我提供帮助。">查看中文翻译</div>
