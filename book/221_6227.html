<div class="line_en">The worst thing about working as a carer is not what you might think. It's not the lifting and cleaning, the medicines and wipes and the distant but somehow always perceptible smell of disinfectant. It's not even the fact that most people assume you're only doing it because you really aren't smart enough to do anything else. It's the fact that when you spend all day in really close proximity to someone, there is no escape from their moods. Or your own.</div>

<div class="line_en">Will had been distant with me all morning, since I had first told him my plans. It was nothing an outsider could have put their finger on, but there were fewer jokes, perhaps less casual conversation. He asked me nothing about the contents of the day's newspapers.</div>

<div class="line_en">Two weeks previously a pair of Jehovah's Witnesses had kept Will captive at the back door for almost fifteen minutes, while he struggled to reverse his chair back over the dislodged doormat.

<div class="line_en">I was starting to feel really cross with him. I had never felt judged by anyone as I felt judged by Will now.

<div class="line_en">He didn't look like a doctor, or consultant. He could have been a financial adviser, but he somehow didn't have the right air about him. He certainly didn't look like a physiotherapist, occupational therapist or dietician -- or one of the legions of other people employed by the local authority to pop by and assess Will's ever-changing needs. You could spot those a mile off. They always looked exhausted, but were briskly, determinedly cheerful. They wore woollens in muted colours, with sensible shoes, and drove dusty estate cars full of folders and boxes of equipment. Mr Lawler had a navy-blue BMW. His gleaming 5-series was not a local authority sort of a car.</div>

<div class="line_en">I spent the next couple of nights trying to work out what Will was up to, and what I could do to stop him, my thoughts racing even as Patrick and I chatted, cooking together in the little galley kitchen. (I was already discovering new things about him -- like, he really did know a hundred different things to do with turkey breast.) At night we made love -- it seemed almost obligatory at the moment, as if we should take full advantage of our freedom. It was as if Patrick somehow felt I owed him something, given my constant physical proximity to Will. But as soon as he dropped off to sleep, I was lost in my thoughts again.</div>

<div class="line_en">Will had escaped into the empty grounds of the castle his whole childhood, he said. His dad let him roam the place, trusting him not to touch anything. After 5.30pm, when the last of the tourists had gone, as the gardeners began to trim and tidy, as the cleaners emptied the bins and swept up the empty cartons of drink and commemorative toffee fudge, it had become his private playground. As he told me this, I mused that if Treena and I had been given the freedom of the castle, all to ourselves, we would have been air punching with disbelief and getting giddy all over the place.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="威尔说，整个童年时期，他老是逃到城堡空旷的院落。他父亲允许他在城堡漫步，相信他不会碰任何东西。下午五点半以后，最后一拨游客已经离开，园丁开始修剪整理，清洁工人清空着垃圾箱，扫走空饮料盒和用作纪念的太妃软糖，那里就成了他的私人游乐场。他告诉我这些时，我思忖着要是特丽娜和我能自由自在地在城堡玩，我们肯定会得意忘形，四处转得头晕眼花。">查看中文翻译</div>

My mother is hanging on by a thread and can't forgive me for still loving my father.

I filled it, you see. I filled it with their laughter, their bodies and their words. I filled it with my own humiliation. I told him how I saw their faces every time I went anywhere beyond the town, and how Patrick and Mum and Dad and my small life had been just fine for me, with all their problems and limitations. They had let me feel safe.</div>
