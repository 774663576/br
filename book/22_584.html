<div class="line_en">Our pictures. There are cabinets, in a separate study, filled with drawers of lewd engravings, that my uncle has collected in a desultory sort of manner, along with his books. He has often spoken of taking on some man to trim and mount them, but has never found a man to match the task. One needs a quite particular character, for work of that sort.</div>

<div class="line_en">Now and then I wonder how he supposes I spend my hours, when not engaged by him. I think he is too used to the particular world of his books, where time passes strangely, or not at all, and imagines me an ageless child. Sometimes that is how I imagine myself -- as if my short, tight gowns and velvet sashes keep me bound, like a Chinese slipper, to a form I should otherwise outleap. My uncle himself -- who is at this time, I suppose, not quite above fifty -- I have always considered to have been perfectly and permanently aged; as flies remain aged, yet fixed and unchanging, in cloudy chips of amber.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有时我会好奇，他以为我会如何消遣掉他用不到我的那些时光呢？我觉得他太沉浸于书本构成的特殊世界了，在那个世界里，时光以奇异的方式流逝着，或者根本就停滞不动了，而我则是个长不大的孩子——有时候我自己也这么想——那短而紧的袍子和天鹅绒腰带，仿佛是中国女人的三寸金莲鞋，将我束缚起来，无法挣脱。至于我舅舅——我估计，他此时年不过五十——我总认为他的年纪是亘古不变的，就好象苍蝇掉进浑浊的松脂中，形态凝固下来，永恒不变了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He draws out from his pocket his chiming watch and holds it to his ear. The key to his library door -- sewn about, at the stem, with faded velvet -- swings noiselessly beside it. He says, "Go on then, go on. Leave an old man to his books. Go and play, but -- gently, Maud."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他从口袋里取出怀表，拿近耳朵。他书房的钥匙——钥匙把上包着褪色的绒布——在怀表后面无声地晃荡着。他说道，“那就去吧，去吧，把老头子丢到他的书里去吧，去吧，耍吧，不过——轻一点，莫德。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I leave him squinting at a page of text. I walk very quietly, in soft-soled shoes. I go to my rooms, where Agnes is. I find her at work at a piece of sewing. She sees me come, and flinches. Do you know how provoking such a flinch will seem, to a temperament like mine? I stand and watch her sew. She feels my gaze, and begins to shake. Her stitches grow long and crooked. At last I take the needle from her hand and gently put the point of it against her flesh; then draw it off; then put it back; then do this, six or seven times more, until her knuckles are marked between the freckles with a rash of needle-pricks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我离开时，他正眯缝着眼看文献。我脚穿软底鞋，悄无声息地走开了。我回到我的房间里，阿格尼斯在那儿。我看到她在做一件针线活儿。她见我回来，随即面露惧色。你知道这样的畏缩神色性情如我者？我站在一旁，看她做针线。她感受到我的注视，开始发抖。她手里针脚变的又粗又歪。最后，我从她夺过手中的针，将针慢慢地扎进她的肉里，再拔出来，再扎进去，如此这般六七回之多，直扎得她手上的雀斑之间冒出许多疹子般的针眼。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Mr Richard Rivers," my uncle says. The name seems auspicious to me. Later I will discover it to be false -- as false as his rings, his smile, his manner; but now, as I stand in the drawing-room and he rises to make me his bow, why should I think to doubt him? He has fine features, even teeth, and is taller than my uncle by almost a foot. His hair is brushed and has oil upon it, but is long: a curl springs from its place and tumbles across his brow. He puts a hand to it, repeatedly. His hands are slender, smooth and -- but for a single finger, stained yellow by smoke -- quite white.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“理查德·瑞富斯先生，”我舅舅说道。这个名字对我似乎是个吉兆。稍后我就会发觉，这是个假名字——跟他的戒指，他的微笑，他的做派一样，都是假的。不过这会儿，我在绘画室里，他起身向我鞠躬行礼，我为何要对他心存怀疑？他外表光鲜，牙齿整齐洁白，人比我舅舅高出几乎一尺。他头发梳理过，上面还抹了发油，头发挺长：有一绺卷头从一侧翻过额头，他老是伸手去捋那绺头发。他的手细长光滑——只有一根手指被香烟熏黄了——非常白皙。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Miss Lilly," he says, as he bends towards me. The lock of hair falls forward, the stained hand lifts to brush it back. His voice is very low, I suppose for my uncle's sake. He must have been cautioned in advance, by Mr Hawtrey.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弯腰行礼时，他口里念道，“李小姐，”那绺额发滑落下来，他伸出那根被烟熏黄的手指把头发拢回去。他音量很低，我猜是考虑到我舅舅的缘故。霍粹先生肯定事先叮嘱过他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr Hawtrey is a London bookseller and publisher, and has been many times to Briar. He takes my hand and kisses it. Behind him comes Mr Huss. He is a gentleman collector, a friend from my uncle's youth. He also takes my hand, but takes it to draw me closer to him, then kisses my cheek. "Dear child," he says. I have been several times surprised by Mr Huss upon the stairs. He likes to stand and watch me climb them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="霍粹先生是伦敦的书商和出版商，他曾多次拜访布莱尔。他执起我的手，亲了一下。他后面进来的是哈斯先生。他是位彬彬有礼的收藏家，也是我舅舅年轻时就相识的朋友。他也执起我的手，却是把我拉近他身边，亲了下我的面颊。“亲爱的孩子。”他说道。我曾有几次在楼梯上被哈斯先生吓到。他喜欢站在那儿，望着我拾级而上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But it is Mr Rivers I watch. And once or twice, when I turn my face his way, I find his own eyes fixed on me, his gaze a thoughtful one. He is weighing me up. Perhaps he has not supposed I would be so handsome. Perhaps I am not so handsome as rumour has had him think. I cannot tell. But, when the dinner-bell sounds and I move to my uncle's side to be walked to the table, I see him hesitate; then he chooses the place next to mine. I wish he had not. I think he will continue to watch me, and I don't like to be watched, while eating. Mr Way and Charles move softly about us, filling our glasses -- mine, that crystal cup, cut with an M. The food is set upon our plates, then the servants leave: they never stay when we have company, but return between courses.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而我一直暗中留意着瑞富斯先生。有那么一两回，我脸转到他所在的方向，就发现他眼睛盯着我，他的目光若有所思。他在掂量我。也许他没料到我会如此俊俏。也许我并不如他听闻的传言中那般俊俏。我也说不出。不过，当正餐的铃声响起，我走到我舅舅身旁，准备走到餐桌边时，我见他犹豫了一下；然后他挑了我旁边的位子坐下。我希望他没这么做。我想他要继续留意观察我，而我吃饭的时候，并不想被人注意到。魏先生和查尔斯在我们身边无声地穿梭来去，为我们的杯子加满酒——我那只刻着M的水晶酒杯。食物已在盘中摆置妥帖，仆人们随即退下：我们聚会时，他们从不在旁伺候，只是用餐结束要转朗诵会的间隙，他们才会回来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I hear her climb into her bed, draw up her blankets. There is a silence. After a little time there comes a creak, a whisper, the faint groan of machinery: my uncle's clock, shifting its gears. I lie and wait for sleep. It does not come. Instead, my limbs grow restless and begin to twitch. I feel, too hard, my blood -- I feel the bafflement of it, at the dead points of my fingers and my toes. I raise my head, call softly: "Agnes!" She does not hear; or hears, but fears to answer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我听到她跳上床，拉起毯子。然后就是一派静默。过了一会儿，传来一阵咯吱声和低语声，还有隐约的机械摩擦声：那是我舅舅的大钟的指针在转动。我躺在床上，等着会周公。周公偏不肯光临。倒是我的四肢开始不安分，开始抽搐起来。我感觉到我的血流，非常有力——我手指和脚趾都感觉到血中的迷乱。我抬起头，轻轻唤道：“阿格尼丝！”她没听见，或者听见了，却不敢应声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I put the portrait away, and call for Agnes to bring me a tumbler of water. I take a drop of my old medicine -- then, unsure that that will calm me, I take another. Then I lie still, my hair put back. My hands, inside their gloves, begin to tingle. Agnes stands and waits. Her own hair is let down -- coarse hair, red hair, coarser and redder than ever against the fine white stuff of her nightdress. One slender collar-bone is marked a delicate blue with what is perhaps only a shadow, but might -- I cannot remember -- be a bruise.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我把小画像丢到一旁，喊阿格尼丝给我倒杯水。我服了一剂以前医生开给我的药——然后，觉得一剂还不够使我平静，我又服了一剂。之后，我一动不动地躺着，头发铺在后面。手套中的手指隐隐有了麻痛的感觉。阿格尼丝站在一旁候着，她头发放下来了——乱糟糟的红头发，被她漂亮的白睡衣衬托的愈发乱，愈发红。她纤细的琵琶骨上有一道细微的蓝色，也许只是道影子，不过也可能——我记不起了——是块淤伤。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Agnes!" -- At last, the sound of my own voice unnerves me. I give it up, lie still. The clock groans again, then strikes. Then come other sounds, far-off. My uncle keeps early hours. Closing doors, lowered voices, shoes upon the stairs: the gentlemen are leaving the drawing-room and going each to their separate chambers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“阿格尼丝！”——终于，我被自己的声量搅得心烦意乱。我不再叫她了，静静地躺着。大钟又发出摩擦声，接着是钟声。远处传来别的声响。我舅舅一贯早起早睡。关门声，压低声量的说话声，上楼梯的声音：客厅里的绅士们散场了，各自回房歇息。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Perhaps I sleep, then -- but if I do, it is only for a moment. For suddenly I give a start, and am wide awake; and I know that what has roused me is not sound, but movement. Movement, and light. Beyond the bed-curtain the rush-lamp's wick has flared suddenly bright, and the doors and the window-glasses are straining against their frames.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当时，我或许是睡着了——不过假使睡着了，那也只有一小会儿。因为我忽然间醒过来，立即清醒无比；我明白，唤醒我的并非声响，而是动作。是动作，和灯光。床帷之外，汽灯灯芯忽然散开了，灯火陡然明亮起来，跳跃的火光把门窗的影子照变了形。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then I know that, after all, this night is not like any other. As if summoned to it by a calling voice, I rise. I stand at the doorway to Agnes's room until I am sure, from the evenness of her breaths, that she is sleeping; then I take up my lamp and go, on naked feet, to my drawing-room. I go to the window and stand at the glass, cup my hands against their own feeble reflection, peer through the darkness at the sweep of gravel, the edge of lawn, that I know lie below. For a time I see nothing. Then I hear the soft fall of a shoe, and then another, still softer. Then comes the single noiseless flaring of a match between slender fingers; and a face, made hollow-eyed and garish as it tilts towards the flame.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此时，我终于明白，是夜非同往昔。仿佛被一个声音召唤着，我起身下床。我先站到通往阿格尼丝房间的门边，从她均匀的呼吸中，断定她正熟睡；我提起灯，光着脚走进我的客厅里。我走到窗边，依窗而立，将手蜷起按在窗玻璃上，借手拢起的微弱反光窥视着窗外，望向我所知的绵延的沙地，草坪边缘。有那么一刻，我眼前一片漆黑，接着，我听见一个轻微的脚步声，然后又是一声，更轻微了。这时，我看到一根火柴无声无息地划着了，执火柴的手细长消瘦；又出现了一张面孔，当他凑近火苗，我看见深凹的眼窝和艳俗的面目。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Cold weather for walking. About the tip of his cigarette, his breath shows whiter than the smoke of his tobacco. He gathers his collar about his throat. Then he looks up. He seems to know what he will see. He does not nod, or make any gesture; only holds my gaze. The cigarette fades, glows bright, fades again. His stance grows more deliberate. He moves his head; and all at once I understand what he is doing, He is surveying the face of the house. He is counting the windows. He is calculating his way to my room! -- and when he is certain of his route he lets his cigarette fall and crushes the glowing point of it beneath his heel. He comes back across the gravel-walk and someone -- Mr Way, I suppose -- admits him. I cannot see that. I only hear the front door open, feel the movement of the air. Again my lamp flares, and the window-glass bulges. This time, however, the house seems holding its breath.</div>

<div class="line_en">I take up my lamp and go quickly, quickly: the shade throws crescents of light upon the walls. I have not time to dress -- cannot dress, without Agnes to help me -- but know I must not see him in my nightgown. I find stockings, garters, slippers, a cloak. My hair, that is loose, I try to fasten; but I am clumsy with the pins, and my gloves -- and the medicine I have swallowed -- make me clumsier. I grow afraid. My heart beats quick again, but now it beats against the drops, it is like a vessel beating hard against the pull of a sluggish river. I put my hand to it, and feel the yielding of my breast -- unlaced, it feels; unguarded, unsafe. But the tug of the drops is greater than the resistance of my fear. That is the point of them, after all. For restlessness. When at length he comes, tapping at my door with his fingernail, I think I seem calm to him. I say at once, "You know my maid is very close -- asleep, but close. One cry will wake her." He bows and says nothing.</div>

Again he smooths his hair, and swallows; and I see at last that he is nervous -- more nervous than I. He leans closer.

<div class="line_en">This is his plan. He means to bring a girl to Briar, from London, and install her as my maid. He means to use her, then cheat her. He says he has a girl in mind, a girl of my years and colouring. A sort of thief -- not overscrupulous, not too clever in her ways, he says; he thinks he will secure her with the promise of some slight share in the fortune -- "Say, two or three thousand. I don't believe she'll have the ambition to ask for more. Her set are a small set, as crooks go; though, like crooks everywhere, think themselves grander." He shrugs. The sum means nothing, after all: for he will agree to whatever she asks for; and she will not see a shilling of it. She will suppose me an innocent, and believe herself assisting in my seduction. She will persuade me, first, into marriage with him, then into a -- he hesitates, before admitting the word -- a madhouse. But, there she will take my place. She will protest -- he hopes she will! -- for the more she does, the more the madhouse keepers will read it as a form of lunacy; and so keep her the closer.</div>

Think of what I have proposed. Then think of your choices. You may wait for another suitor: shall you find one, among the gentlemen your uncle's work brings here? And, if you do, shall he be as scrupulous as I, in the handling of your fortune? -- of your person? Or, say you wait for your uncle to die, and find a liberty that way; meantime, his eyes have faded, his limbs have a tremor, he has worked you the harder as he has felt his powers fail. By then you are -- what age? Say thirty-five, or forty. You have given your youth to the curating of books, of a kind that Hawtrey sells, for a shilling, to drapers' boys and clerks.
