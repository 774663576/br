<div class="line_en">Elsa has been chased hundreds of times before, but never like in that churchyard. And the fear she feels now is something else. Because she had time to see his eyes just before she ran, and they looked so determined, so cold, like he was ready to kill her. That's a lot for an almost-eight-year-old to handle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱莎以前被追逐过上百次，但从没有像墓地这次一样。她现在感受到的是另一种恐惧，她在逃跑前看到了他的眼睛，它们看上去那么坚定、冷酷，像是准备杀死她。这对一个快八岁的孩子来说，很难承受。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Elsa tried never to be afraid while Granny was alive. Or at least she tried never to show it. Because Granny hated fears. Fears are small, fiery creatures from the Land-of-Almost-Awake, with rough pelts that coincidentally look quite a lot like blue tumble-dryer fluff, and if you give them the slightest opportunity they jump up and nibble your skin and try to scratch your eyes. Fears are like cigarettes, said Granny: the hard thing isn't stopping, it's not starting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="外婆在世时，爱莎试过不去害怕，至少她试着不表现出害怕。外婆痛恨恐惧，恐惧是不眠大陆上一种暴躁的小生物，皮毛粗糙，看起来正像是烘干机里的蓝色毛球。只要有一点点机会，它们就会跳起来咬你的皮肤，试图抓瞎你的眼睛。恐惧就像是香烟，外婆说，困难的不是戒掉，而是不要开始。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Noween is a prehistoric monster that wants everything to happen immediately. Every time a child says "in a minute" or "later" or "I'm just going to…" the Noween bellows with furious force: "Nooo! IT HAS TO BE DONE NOOOW!" The Noween hates children, because children refuse to accept the Noween's lie that time is linear. Children know that time is just an emotion, so "now" is a meaningless word to them, just as it was for Granny. George used to say that Granny wasn't a time-optimist, she was a time-atheist, and the only religion she believed in was Do-It-Later-Buddhism.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="诺温是一头史前怪兽，它希望所有的事情立即发生。每次当一个孩子说“马上”或“回头”或“我正要去…”的时候，诺温就会用愤怒的声音大吼：“不！现在就去！”诺温讨厌孩子，因为孩子们拒绝相信诺温的谎言——时间是线性的。孩子们认为时间只是一种情绪，所以“现在”对他们来说是一个毫无意义的词语，对外婆也一样。乔治常说外婆不是个“时间乐观主义者”，她是一个“时间无神论者”，唯一信奉的宗教是“以后再说”教。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Noween brought the fears to the Land-of-Almost-Awake to catch children, because when a Noween gets hold of a child it engulfs the child's future, leaving the victim helpless where it is, facing an entire life of eating now and sleeping now and tidying up right away. Never again can the child postpone something boring till later and do something fun in the meantime. All that's left is now. A fate far worse than death, Granny always said, so the tale of the Noween started by clarifying that it hated fairy tales.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="诺温把恐惧带到不眠大陆，并且抓捕孩子。它每抓到一个孩子就会吞噬这个孩子的未来，留下无助的受害者在原地，从此面对“现在吃饭、现在睡觉、立刻整理”这样的人生。那个孩子将再也不能为有趣的事情而推迟做无聊的事情了，他只剩下现在。这是比死亡还可怕的命运，外婆以前总这么说，诺温的故事起始于它对童话故事的痛恨。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Because nothing is better at making a child postpone something than a fairy tale. So one night the Noween slithered up Telling Mountain, the highest mountain peak in the Land-of-Almost-Awake, where it caused a massive landslide, which demolished the entire peak. Then it lay in wait in a dark cave. For Telling Mountain is the mountain the enphants have to climb in order to release the tales so they can glide over into the real world, and if the tales can't leave Telling Mountain the whole kingdom of Miamas will suffocate, and then the whole Land-of-Almost-Awake will suffocate. For no stories can live without children listening to them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因为没有比童话故事更能让孩子们拖拖拉拉的了。所以某天晚上，诺温爬上“讲述山”——不眠大陆最高的山峰，制造了一次大规模的山崩，摧毁了整个山峰。然后它躺在漆黑的洞穴里守着，因为蚁象必须在这座山上将故事放生，好让它们滑翔进入真实世界，而如果故事不能离开讲述山，整个不眠大陆就会窒息。没有孩子听故事，故事们就会死去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When the warriors from Mibatalos came up the mountain, the Noween released the fears, and they immediately transformed themselves into each individual soldier's worst nightmare. For all beings have a mortal fear, even the warriors from Mibatalos, and the air in the Land-of-Almost-Awake slowly grew thinner. Storytellers found it increasingly difficult to breathe.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="密巴塔洛斯的战士登上山时，诺温释放出恐惧，它们即刻变化成每个士兵最害怕的噩梦。所有的生物都有各自害怕的东西，即使是密巴塔洛斯的战士也不例外。然后，不眠大陆的空气慢慢变得稀薄。故事讲述者们发现自己呼吸困难。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When dawn came, all the bravest fighters from Mibatalos tried to climb the mountain and defeat the Noween, but no one managed it. Because the Noween was breeding fears in the caves. Fears need to be handled carefully, because threats just make them grow bigger. So every time a parent somewhere threatened a child, it worked as fertilizer. "Soon," a child said somewhere, and then a parent yelled, "No, nooow! Or I'll --" And, bang, another fear was hatched in one of the Noween's caves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黎明来临时，密巴塔洛斯最勇敢的战士来到山上，想要打败诺温，但没人做得到。诺温在洞穴里繁殖恐惧。处理恐惧得很小心，威胁只能让它们变得更大。每当某个家长威胁孩子，他的话就变成了恐惧的肥料。“马上。”某个孩子说，而家长则大叫：“不！现在！不然的话我就——”“砰”的一声，诺温的洞穴里又诞生了一只恐惧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">(Elsa obviously interrupted Granny at this point because her whole thing about fears transforming themselves into what you are most afraid of was actually nicked from Harry Potter, because that's how a boggart works. And then Granny had snorted and answered, "Maybe it's that Harry muppet who nicked it from me?" And then Elsa had sneered, "Harry Potter doesn't steal!" And then they had argued for quite a long time about that, and in the end Granny gave up and mumbled, "Fine, then! Forget the whole bloody thing! Fears don't transform themselves, they just bite and try to scratch your eyes, are you SATISFIED now or what?" And then Elsa had left it there and they went on with the story. )</div>

<div class="line_en">That's when the two golden knights showed up. Everyone tried to warn them about riding up the mountain, but they didn't listen, of course. Knights can be so damned obstinate. But when they came up the mountain and all the fears welled out of the caves, the golden knights didn't fight. They didn't yell and swear as other warriors would have done. Instead the knights did the only thing you can do with fears: they laughed at them. Loud, defiant laughter. And then all the fears were turned to stone, one by one.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在那时，出现了两位金色骑士。所有人都警告他们不要上山，但他们没听。骑士们还真的挺固执的。他们来到山上，所有的恐惧从山洞中涌出，金色骑士没有战斗。他们只做了对恐惧唯一可做的那件事：嘲笑它们，笑得非常大声。结果所有的恐惧就变成了石头，一只接一只。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Granny was fond of rounding off fairy tales with things being turned to stone because she wasn't very good at endings. Elsa never complained, though. The Noween was obviously put in prison for an indeterminate length of time, which made it insanely angry. And the ruling council of the Land-of-Almost-Awake decided to appoint a small group of inhabitants from each of the kingdoms, warriors from Mibatalos and dream hunters from Mirevas and sorrow-keepers from Miploris and musicians from Mimovas and storytellers from Miamas, to keep guard over Telling Mountain. The stones of the fears were used to rebuild the peak higher than ever, and at the foot of the mountain the sixth kingdom was built: Miaudacas. And in the fields of Miaudacas, courage was cultivated, so that no one would ever again have to be afraid of the fears.</div>

<div class="line_en">Or, well. That is what they did until, as Granny once told Elsa, after the harvest they took all the courage plants and made a special drink of them, and if you had some of it you became incredibly brave. And then Elsa did a bit of Googling and then she pointed out to Granny that it wasn't a very responsible analogy to divulge to a child. And then Granny groaned, "Oh, right, okay, let's say they don't drink it, it's just THERE, okay?!" So that's the whole story of the two golden knights who defeated the fears. Granny told it every time Elsa was afraid of anything, and even though Elsa was often quite right in her criticism of Granny's storytelling technique, it actually worked every time. She wasn't at all as afraid afterwards.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“雷诺怎么跑这儿来的，如果没人有车钥匙的话？”她这么想，但明白妈妈不能回答，因为她也不知道。所以爱莎叫妈妈告诉她暗影的事情。妈妈又摸了摸爱莎的脸颊，从座位上吃力地坐起来，一只手放在“小半”上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They put blankets over the wurse in the backseat and Mum calmly cautions it to stay still if it hears anyone coming. And it agrees. Elsa promises it several times that she'll find a better hiding place, although it can't seem to see the point of this. On the other hand, it looks very pleased about her going off to find more cookies.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她们在后座的呜嘶身上盖上毯子，妈妈平静地提醒它，如果听见有人来，它就要保持不动。它同意了。爱莎保证了好几次，她一定会去找个更好的藏身之处，虽然它似乎觉得没有必要。另一方面，爱莎说还要去找更多饼干时，它很满意。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Elsa wants to protest, but Mum has already climbed out of Renault, so Elsa doesn't have much choice but to follow her. That is Mum's superpower, after all. Mum brings Wolfheart's coat. She says she's going to wash it so he can have it when he comes home. Elsa likes thinking about that. How he's coming home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱莎想抗议，但妈妈已经爬出雷诺，所以爱莎没有别的选择，只能跟上她。毕竟那是妈妈的超能力。妈妈带着狼心的外套，说要洗一洗，这样他回家的时候就能穿了。爱莎很喜欢这个说法——他回家的时候。">查看中文翻译</div>
