<div class="line_en">This is a story about a man named Eddie and it begins at the end, with Eddie dying in the sun. It might seem strange to start a story with an ending. But all endings are also beginnings. We just don't know it at the time.</div>

<div class="line_en">The last hour of Eddie's life was spent, like most of the others, at Ruby Pier, an amusement park by a great gray ocean. The park had the usual attractions, a boardwalk, a Ferris wheel, roller coasters, bumper cars, a taffy stand, and an arcade where you could shoot streams of water into a clown's mouth. It also had a big new ride called Freddy's Free Fall, and this would be where Eddie would be killed, in an accident that would make newspapers around the state.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱迪生命中的最后一个小时，像大部分其他时间一样，是在“红宝石码头”——壮观的灰色大海边上的一个游乐场里度过的。游乐场里有各种常见的游乐项目，一条木板搭成的海滨走道、一座阜氏摩天巨轮、疯狂过山车、碰碰车、一个卖太妃糖的小亭子，以及一间你可以往小丑嘴里射水柱的电子游戏室。还有一座名叫“弗雷迪自由落体”的巨大的全新游乐车，爱迪将在这里发生的一次事故中丧生，这事故将登上全州的各家报纸。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At the time of his death, Eddie was a squat, white-haired old man, with a short neck, a barrel chest, thick forearms, and a faded army tattoo on his right shoulder. His legs were thin and veined now, and his left knee, wounded in the war, was ruined by arthritis. He used a cane to get around. His face was broad and craggy from the sun, with salty whiskers and a lower jaw that protruded slightly, making him look prouder than he felt. He kept a cigarette behind his left ear and a ring of keys hooked to his belt. He wore rubber-soled shoes. He wore an old linen cap. His pale brown uniform suggested a workingman, and a workingman he was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="临终的时候，爱迪是一个矮墩墩的白发老人，短颈阔胸，手臂粗壮，右肩上一个刺身军记依稀可见。此时的他，两腿瘦削，青筋暴突，战争中受伤的左膝，因关节炎而致残。他拄着拐杖走路。一副宽厚的脸膛被太阳晒得粗糙不平，胡子坚硬，下颚微突，使他看上去比实际上自负。他的左耳朵上夹着一根香烟，皮带上挂着一串钥匙。他脚穿胶底鞋，头戴一顶旧布帽子。从他身上穿的那套褪了色的棕色制服看，他是一个工人。他也确实是一个工人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Eddie's job was "maintaining" the rides, which really meant keeping them safe. Every afternoon, he walked the park, checking on each attraction, from the Tilt-A-Whirl to the Pipeline Plunge. He looked for broken boards, loose bolts, worn-out steel. Sometimes he would stop, his eyes glazing over, and people walking past thought something was wrong. But he was listening, that's all. After all these years he could hear trouble, he said, in the spits and stutters and thrumming of the equipment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱迪的工作是“维修”游乐设施，实际上就是保证它们的安全。每天下午，他在公园里巡视，检查每一项设施，从“漩涡激流”到“黑管历险”。他四处查看，寻找断裂的木板、松动的螺栓、损耗的钢筋。有时，他会停下脚步，两眼呆呆地凝视前方，过往的游人以为出了什么事。但是，他只是在聆听，仅此而已。经过这么多年之后，他说，他能在这些机器的哼哼唧唧中听出问题来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">With 50 minutes left on earth, Eddie took his last walk along Ruby Pier. He passed an elderly couple.</div>

<div class="line_en">They nodded politely. Customers knew Eddie. At least the regular ones did. They saw him summer after summer, one of those faces you associate with a place. His work shirt had a patch on the chest that read EDDIE above the word MAINTENANCE, and sometimes they would say, "Hiya, Eddie Maintenance," although he never thought that was funny.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们礼貌地点点头。游客们认识爱迪，起码常客认识。年复一年，他们都会在夏天里见到他，那是一张会让你想起某个地方的脸。他工作服衬衫的胸口上有一块补片，上面写着“爱迪”，下面是“维修部”，有时，人们喊他，“你好！爱迪·维修部”，他可从来没觉得滑稽。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Today, it so happened, was Eddie's birthday, his 83rd. A doctor, last week, had told him he had shingles. Shingles? Eddie didn't even know what they were. Once, he had been strong enough to lift a carousel horse in each arm. That was a long time ago.</div>

<div class="line_en">Forty minutes until his death. Eddie made his way to the front of the roller coaster line. He rode every attraction at least once a week, to be certain the brakes and steering were solid. Today was coaster day -- the "Ghoster Coaster" they called this one -- and the kids who knew Eddie yelled to get in the cart with him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="距离死亡还有四十分钟。爱迪走到排队等候疯狂过山车的人们前面。每座游乐车他一周起码坐一次，他要知道刹车和行驶都稳妥才放心。今天的节目是过山车——他们管这个叫“魔鬼过山车”——认识爱迪的孩子们嚷着要跟他坐一节车。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Children liked Eddie. Not teenagers. Teenagers gave him headaches. Over the years, Eddie figured he'd seen every sort of do-nothing, snarl-at-you teenager there was. But children were different. Children looked at Eddie -- who, with his protruding lower jaw, always seemed to be grinning, like a dolphin -- and they trusted him. They drew in like cold hands to a fire. They hugged his leg. They played with his keys. Eddie mostly grunted, never saying much. He figured it was because he didn't say much that they liked him.</div>

Five kids from Pitkin Avenue had cornered his brother, Joe, and were about to give him a beating. Eddie was a block away, on a stoop, eating a sandwich. He heard his brother scream.

<div class="line_en">One of the shop workers, a lanky, bony-cheeked young man named Dominguez, was by the solvent sink, wiping grease off a wheel.</div>

<div class="line_en">The shop smelled like sawdust. It was dark and cramped with a low ceiling and pegboard walls that held drills and saws and hammers. Skeleton parts of fun park rides were everywhere: compressors, engines, belts, lightbulbs, the top of a pirate's head. Stacked against one wall were coffee cans of nails and screws, and stacked against another wall were endless tubs of grease.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="修理车间里有一股锯屑味。低垂的天花板和挂满了钻头、锯和锤子的木板墙使车间显得昏暗狭窄。游乐设施零配件随处可见：压缩机、马达、皮带、灯泡，还有一个海盗脑袋的天灵盖。靠墙堆成一垛的是装在咖啡盒里的钉子和螺丝，另一面墙前堆着成桶成桶不计其数的润滑油。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Greasing a track, Eddie would say, required no more brains than washing a dish; the only difference was you got dirtier as you did it, not cleaner. And that was the sort of work that Eddie did: spread grease, adjusted brakes, tightened bolts, checked electrical panels. Many times he had longed to leave this place, find different work, build another kind of life. But the war came. His plans never worked out. In time, he found himself graying and wearing looser pants and in a state of weary acceptance, that this was who he was and who he would always be, a man with sand in his shoes in a world of mechanical laughter and grilled frankfurters. Like his father before him, like the patch on his shirt, Eddie was maintenance -- the head of maintenance -- or as the kids sometimes called him, "the ride man at Ruby Pier."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="润滑游乐车的轨道，爱迪说，跟洗碗一样不需要动脑筋；惟一不同的是，你本人会越干越脏，而不是越弄越干净。这正是爱迪干的活：抹润滑油、调整刹车片、拧紧螺栓、检查电路板。有多少次啊，他渴望离开这里，找一份不同的工作，建立另一种生活。但是，战争爆发了。他的计划落空了。最后，他发现自己的头发越来越灰白，穿的裤子越来越宽松，便也无可奈何地接受了现实：这就是他，他永远都会是这个样子，鞋里揣着沙子，生活在机械的笑声和烤香肠的世界里。就像从前他的父亲，像他衬衫上的补片，爱迪就等于维修——维修部的头——或者，像孩子们有时称呼他的那样，是“‘红宝石码头’的过山车人”。">查看中文翻译</div>

His legs were red from the sun, and his left knee still showed scars. In truth, much of Eddie's body suggested a survived encounter. His fingers were bent at awkward angles, thanks to numerous fractures from assorted machinery. His nose had been broken several times in what he called "saloon fights." His broadly jawed face might have been good-looking once, the way a prizefighter might have looked before he took too many punches.</div>

She wore a yellow cotton dress, with a pink barrette in her hair. Eddie didn't say much. He was so nervous he felt as if his tongue were glued to his teeth. They danced to the music of a big band, Long Legs Delaney and his Everglades Orchestra. He bought her a lemon fizz. She said she had to go before her parents got angry. But as she walked away, she turned and waved.</div>

<div class="line_en">And Eddie was right. Inside the base of Freddy's Free Fall, hidden from view, the cable that lifted Cart No. 2 had, for the last few months, been scraping across a locked pulley. Because it was locked, the pulley had gradually ripped the cable's steel wires -- as if husking an ear of corn -- until they were nearly severed. No one noticed. How could they notice? Only someone who had crawled inside the mechanism would have seen the unlikely cause of the problem.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱迪说得没错。在“弗雷迪自由落体”的底座里面，人们看不见的地方，几个月以来，拉动二号车的电缆，一直在一个被卡住的滑轮上摩擦。因为滑轮被卡住了，所以电缆的钢线在一根根地被扯断——像剥一粟玉米那样——直到整个电缆几乎被磨断了。没人注意到。怎么能注意到呢？只有什么人爬到机器里去，才能看到这令人难以想像的问题所在。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The pulley was wedged by a small object that must have fallen through the opening at a most precise moment.</div>

<div class="line_en">"DOM! WILLIE!" Eddie yelled. Someone banged against his waist, knocking his walkie-talkie to the ground. Eddie bent to get it. Willie went to the controls. He put his finger on the green button. Eddie looked up.</div>

<div class="line_en">Eddie's eyes shot from her to the carts. Did he have time? Her to the carts -- Whump. Too late. The carts were dropping. Jesus, he released the brake!-- and for Eddie, everything slipped into watery motion. He dropped his cane and pushed off his bad leg and felt a shot of pain that almost knocked him down. A big step. Another step. Inside the shaft of Freddy's Free Fall, the cable snapped its final thread and ripped across the hydraulic line. Cart No. 2 was in a dead drop now, nothing to stop it, a boulder off a cliff.</div>

<div class="line_en">In those final moments, Eddie seemed to hear the whole world: distant screaming, waves, music, a rush of wind, a low, loud, ugly sound that he realized was his own voice blasting through his chest. The little girl raised her arms. Eddie lunged. His bad leg buckled. He half flew, half stumbled toward her, landing on the metal platform, which ripped through his shirt and split open his skin, just beneath the patch that read EDDIE and MAINTENANCE. He felt two hands in his own, two small hands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在生命的最后时刻里，爱迪好像听到了整个世界的声音：远处的尖叫声、海浪声、音乐声、风声，以及一个忽高忽低难听的声音，他意识到，原来那是从他自己的胸腔里迸发出来的声音。小女孩举起双手。爱迪扑了过去。他的坏腿一瘸。他半飞半跌地朝她扑了过去，栽倒在金属平台上。金属平台撕开他的衬衫，擦破了他的皮肤，正好在那个写着“爱迪”和“维修部”的补片下面。他感到两只手握在了他的手里，两只小手。">查看中文翻译</div>
