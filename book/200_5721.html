<div class="line_en">Charms was always one of the best lessons in which to enjoy a private chat; there was generally so much movement and activity that the danger of being overheard was very slight. Today, with the room full of croaking bullfrogs and cawing ravens, and with a heavy downpour of rain clattering and pounding against the classroom windows, Harry, Ron and Hermione's whispered discussion about how Umbridge had nearly caught Sirius went quite unnoticed.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I've been suspecting this ever since Filch accused you of ordering Dungbombs, because it seemed such a stupid lie," Hermione whispered. "I mean, once your letter had been read it would have been quite clear you weren't ordering them, so you wouldn't have been in trouble at all -- it's a bit of a feeble joke, isn't it? But then I thought, what if somebody just wanted an excuse to read your mail? Well then, it would be a perfect way for Umbridge to manage it -- tip off Filch, let him do the dirty work and confiscate the letter, then either find a way of stealing it from him or else demand to see it -- I don't think Filch would object, when's he ever stuck up for a student's rights? Harry, you're squashing your frog."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“自从费尔奇说你订了大粪蛋，我就一直有这种怀疑，因为那显然是个愚蠢的谎话。”赫敏小声说，“我是说看了你的信，就会很清楚你没订，所以你不应该有麻烦——一个无聊的玩笑，不是吗？可后来我想，要是有人就想找借口看你的信呢？那样，对乌姆里奇可是个好办法——告诉费尔奇，让他做恶人没收那封信，然后从他那儿偷去，或要求看信——我不认为费尔奇会拒绝，他什么时候维护过学生的权利？哈利，你要把你的青蛙捏死了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry kicked off from the ground, spraying mud in all directions, and shot upwards, the wind pulling him slightly off course. He had no idea how he was going to see the Snitch in this weather; he was having enough difficulty seeing the one Bludger with which they were practising; a minute into the practice it almost unseated him and he had to use the Sloth Grip Roll to avoid it. Unfortunately, Angelina did not see this. In fact, she did not appear to be able to see anything; none of them had a clue what the others were doing. The wind was picking up; even at a distance Harry could hear the swishing, pounding sounds of the rain pummelling the surface of the lake.</div>

She led her sodden and disgruntled team back into the changing rooms, insisting that the practice had not been a waste of time, though without any real conviction in her voice. Fred and George were looking particularly annoyed; both were bandy-legged and winced with every movement. Harry could hear them complaining in low voices as he towelled his hair dry.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Good one!" said Harry encouragingly, deciding not to point out that in a real duel Neville's opponent was unlikely to be staring in the opposite direction with his wand held loosely at his side. "Listen, Neville, can you take it in turns to practise with Ron and Hermione for a couple of minutes so I can walk around and see how the rest are doing?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不错！”哈利鼓励地说，决定不指出在真正的搏斗时，对方不可能看着别处，魔杖松握在一边，“纳威，你能不能轮流跟罗恩和赫敏练一会儿，我随便走走，看看大家练得怎么样。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The room was suddenly full of shouts of Expelliarmus. Wands flew in all directions; missed spells hit books on shelves and sent them flying into the air. Harry was too quick for Neville, whose wand went spinning out of his hand, hit the ceiling in a shower of sparks and landed with a clatter on top of a bookshelf, from which Harry retrieved it with a Summoning Charm. Glancing around, he thought he had been right to suggest they practise the basics first; there was a lot of shoddy spellwork going on; many people were not succeeding in Disarming their opponents at all, but merely causing them to jump backwards a few paces or wince as their feeble spell whooshed over them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="屋里顿时一片除你武器之声，魔杖四处乱飞，打偏了的咒语击中架子上的书籍，一本本的书飞到了空中。哈利身手快，纳威的魔杖旋转着飞出去，撞到天花板上，火星四溅，然后当啷一声落到书架顶上，哈利用飞来咒把它收了回来。他看看周围，感到从基本功练起是对的。许多咒语用得乱七八糟，不少人根本不能解除对手的武器，只是逼着他们往后跳几步或畏缩一下，无力的咒语从他们头上呼啸飞过。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry walked around the other pairs, trying to correct those who were doing the spell wrong. Ginny was teamed with Michael Corner; she was doing very well, whereas Michael was either very bad or unwilling to jinx her. Ernie Macmillan was flourishing his wand unnecessarily, giving his partner time to get in under his guard; the Creevey brothers were enthusiastic but erratic and mainly responsible for all the books leaping off the shelves around them; Luna Lovegood was similarly patchy, occasionally sending Justin Finch-Fletchleys wand spinning out of his hand, at other times merely causing his hair to stand on end.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利走了一圈，努力纠正做错的人。金妮和迈克尔·科纳一组，她做得很好，迈克尔虽然做得不是很差，但就是不肯对她念这个咒语。厄尼·麦克米兰不必要地挥舞着魔杖，使得对方有隙可乘。克里维兄弟很热情，但技术不稳定，附近架子上飞起的书大都是他们的功劳。卢娜·洛夫古德也是反复无常，有时能让贾斯廷·芬列里的魔杖旋转着飞出，其他时候则只是让他的头发竖了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry moved off into the middle of the room. Something very odd was happening to Zacharias Smith. Every time he opened his mouth to disarm Anthony Goldstein, his own wand would fly out of his hand, yet Anthony did not seem to be making a sound. Harry did not have to look far to solve the mystery: Fred and George were several feet from Smith and taking it in turns to point their wands at his back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利走到屋子中央，扎卡赖斯·史密斯出了很奇怪的情况，每次他张嘴要解除安东尼·戈德斯坦的武器时，自己的魔杖却飞了出去，而安东尼好像并未发声。但哈利没多久就解开了谜团，弗雷德和乔治离史密斯不远，两人轮流用魔杖指着他的后背。">查看中文翻译</div>
