I didn't need to, because he was sitting right next to me, but I wanted to practise my writing. After an hour or two of hard work, I passed this letter to him.</div>

<div class="line_en">I always knew I would be apprenticed to Joe as soon as I was old enough, and so I used to spend most of the day helping him in the forge. However, I also attended the village evening school, which was organized by an ancient relation of Mr Wopsle's. Her teaching mostly consisted of falling asleep while we children fought each other, but Mr Wopsle's young cousin, Biddy, tried to keep us under control and teach us to read, write and count. Mr Wopsle"examined"us every three months. In fact he did not ask us any questions at all, but read aloud from Shakespeare, waving his arms dramatically and enjoying the sound of his own voice.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="乔夫人以常用的粗暴手法给我从头到脚洗了洗澡，给我穿上最好的衣服，把我交给潘波趣先生。我小声哭着，上了马车到了镇上。以前我从来没有离开乔，对我来讲，在郝薇香小姐家将会发生什么，我不敢想。">查看中文翻译</div>

In the centre of the room, sitting at a table, was the strangest lady I have ever seen, or shall ever see. She was wearing a wedding dress made of rich material. She had a bride's flowers in her hair, but her hair was white. There were suitcases full of dresses and Jewels around her, ready for a journey. She only had one white shoe on. Then I realized that over the years the white wedding dress had become yellow, and the flowers in her hair had died, and the bride inside the dress had grown old. Everything in the room was ancient and dying. The only brightness in the room was in her dark old eyes, that stared at me.</div>

<div class="line_en">And so I found myself back in the overgrown garden in the bright daylight. Estella put some bread and meat down on the ground for me, like a dog. I was so offended by her behaviour towards me that tears came to my eyes. As soon as she saw this, She gave a delighted laugh, and pushed me out of the gate. I walked the four miles home to the forge, thinking about all I had seen. As I looked sadly at my hands and boots, I remembered that I was only a common working boy, and wished I could be different.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我发现自己在强烈的阳光下回到了那个长满藤蔓的花园里。艾丝黛拉给我拿了些面包和肉食，放在地上，像喂狗一样。我被她的行为触怒了，我的眼泪夺眶而出。一看到这一切，她得意地一笑，就把我推出了门外。我走了4英里的路回到铁匠铺，想起我所看到的一切。当我伤心地看着我的双手和靴子，我记住了，我只是一个普通家庭的孩子，我希望我能改变这一切。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">My sister was curious to know all the details of my visit, and kept asking me question after question. Somehow I felt I could not, or did not want to, explain about Miss Havisham and her strange house. I knew my sister would not understand. And the worst of it was, that old fool Pumblechook arrived at tea-time, to ask more questions. Just looking at his fishy staring eyes and open mouth made me want to keep silent.</div>
