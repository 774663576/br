<div class="line_en">Down the hall, in the bedroom, Wendy could hear the typewriter Jack had carried up from downstairs burst into life for thirty seconds, fall silent for a minute or two, and then rattle briefly again. It was like listening to machine-gun fire from an isolated pillbox. The sound was music to her ears; Jack had not been writing so steadily since the second year of their marriage, when he wrote the story that Esquire had purchased. He said he thought the play would be done by the end of the year, for better or worse, and he would be moving on to something new. He said he didn't care if The Little School stirred any excitement when Phyllis showed it around, didn't care if it sank without a trace, and Wendy believed that, too. The actual act of his writing made her immensely hopeful, not because she expected great things from the play but because her husband seemed to be slowly closing a huge door on a roomful of monsters. He had had his shoulder to that door for a long time now, but at last it was swinging shut.</div>

<div class="line_en">Danny was hunched over the first of the five battered primers Jack had dug up by culling mercilessly through Boulder's myriad secondhand bookshops. They would take Danny right up to the second-grade reading level, a program she had told Jack she thought was much too ambitious. Their son was intelligent, they knew that, but it would be a mistake to push him too far too fast. Jack had agreed. There would be no pushing involved. But if the kid caught on fast, they would be prepared. And now she wondered if Jack hadn't been right about that, too.</div>

<div class="line_en">Danny, prepared by four years of "Sesame Street" and three years of "Electric Company," seemed to be catching on with almost scary speed. It bothered her. He hunched over the innocuous little books, his crystal radio and balsa glider on the shelf above him, as though his life depended on learning to read. His small face was more tense and paler than she liked in the close and cozy glow of the goosenecked lamp they had put in his room. He was taking it very seriously, both the reading and the workbook pages his father made up for him every afternoon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹尼看过四年的《芝麻街》和三年的《电动公司》，他的理解力提高的速度之快着实吓人，这让她感到不安。他伏在那几本并不有趣的小书上，收音机和滑翔机摆在上前方的架子上，仿佛他的生命全维系于学会阅读似的。在舒适的台灯光线下，他的小脸蛋紧张、苍白得让她生厌。无论是阅读，还是爸爸每天下午为他出的练习题，他都非常认真地对待。">查看中文翻译</div>

Another sign -- and they were multiplying all the time -- that there was another human being in the place, not just a carbon copy of one of them or a combination of both. It made her a little sad. Someday her child would be a stranger to her, and she would be strange to him… but not as strange as her own mother had become to her. Please don't let it be that way, God.

<div class="line_en">Still sitting in the chair beside Danny's reading table, she let her eyes wander around her son's room. The glider's wing had been neatly mended. His desk was piled high with picture books, coloring books, old Spiderman comic books with the covers half torn off, Crayolas, and an untidy pile of Lincoln Logs. The VW model was neatly placed above these lesser things, its shrink-wrap still undisturbed. He and his father would be putting it together tomorrow night or the night after if Danny went on at this rate, and never mind the end of the week. His pictures of Pooh and Eyore and Christopher Robin were tacked neatly to the wall, soon enough to be replaced with pin-ups and photographs of dope-smoking rock singers, she supposed. Innocence to experience. Human nature, baby. Grab it and growl. Still it made her sad. Next year he would be in school and she would lose at least half of him, maybe more, to his friends. She and Jack had tried to have another one for a while when things had seemed to be going well at Stovington, but she was on the pill again now.</div>

He slapped on the kitchen overheads and crossed to the sink. The washed dishes from supper were still heaped up in the drainer, where Wendy had left them to drip-dry.

<div class="line_en">In his mind he heard himself screaming into his frightened, crying son's face: Don't stutter/ He wiped his lips again.</div>

<div class="line_en">His heart thudding slowly in his chest, he took his pictures and then set the camera down to wait for them to develop. He wiped his lips with the palm of his hand. One thought played over and over in his mind, echoing with (You lost your temper. You lost your temper. You lost your temper.) an almost superstitious dread. They had come back. He had killed the wasps but they had come back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的心脏沉缓地跳动着，他拍了照，然后放下相机等着胶片显影。他用手掌抹了抹嘴唇。有个想法在他脑子里一次又一次地打着转儿，回荡着一种近乎迷信的恐怖。（你发脾气了。你发脾气了。你发脾气了。）它们复活了。他杀死了那些黄蜂，可是它们复活了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He went to Danny's worktable, rummaged in its drawers, and came up with a big jigsaw puzzle with a fiberboard backing. He took it over to the bedtable and carefully slid the bowl and the nest onto it. The wasps buzzed angrily inside their prison. Then, putting his hand firmly on top of the bowl so it wouldn't slip, he went out into the hall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他来到丹尼的书桌旁，在抽屉里翻寻，找出了一个带纤维板背衬的大七巧板。他来到床头桌边，小心翼翼地将碗和蜂窝移到板子上。黄蜂在碗里气恼得嗡嗡直叫。他紧紧按住玻璃碗，免得它滑动，然后端着蜂窝来到走廊。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That was crazy. Seventeenth-century bullshit. Insects didn't regenerate. And even if wasp eggs could mature full-grown insects in twelve hours, this wasn't the season in which the queen laid. That happened in April or May. Fall was their dying time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="瞎扯。简直是17世纪的胡言乱语，成虫肯定没复活。就算蜂卵能在12小时内孵出来，可现在也不是蜂王产卵的季节——那得在四五月间。秋天是它们死亡的季节。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The bomb sure hadn't been a dud. He had seen the thick white smoke start to puff out of it when he had pulled the ring. And when he had gone up two hours later, he had shaken a drift of small dead bodies out of the hole in the top.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="灭虫弹肯定不是颗哑弹。拉开上面的环的时候，他亲眼看到里面冒出了白色的浓烟。而且，两个小时后他又上了屋顶，从蜂窝顶上的窟窿里抖出了一堆死黄蜂。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He took them downstairs and through the kitchen. In back there was a door which gave on the outside. A cold night wind blew against his nearly naked body, and his feet went numb almost instantly against the cold concrete of the platform he was standing on, the platform where milk deliveries were made during the hotel's operating season. He put the puzzle and the bowl down carefully, and when he stood up he looked at the thermometer nailed outside the door. FRESH UP WITH 7-up, the thermometer said, and the mercury stood at an even twenty-five degrees. The cold would kill them by morning. He went in and shut the door firmly. After a moment's thought he locked it, too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他端着蜂窝来到楼下，穿过厨房。这里有一道后门通往楼外。寒冷的夜风吹打着他近乎赤裸的身体，一踏上那个冰冷的水泥平台——旺季时饭店的牛奶就送到这个平台上来——他的脚就麻木了。他轻手轻脚地把七巧板和玻璃碗放下，站起来看了看钉在门外的温度计。水银柱停在华氏25度上，到天亮它们就会被冻死的。他回到屋里，把门关紧，想了想，又把门锁上了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And suddenly he found that he didn't like the Overlook so well anymore, as if it wasn't wasps that had stung his son, wasps that had miraculously lived through the bug bomb assault, but the hotel itself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然，他发现自己不那么喜欢饭店了，好像蜇他儿子的不是黄蜂，不是在经受了灭虫弹的袭击后奇迹般地活下来的黄蜂，而是饭店本身。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He crossed the kitchen again and shut off the lights. He stood in the darkness for a moment, thinking, wanting a drink. Suddenly the hotel seemed full of a thousand stealthy sounds: creakings and groans and the sly sniff of the wind under the eaves where more wasps' nests might be hanging like deadly fruit.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他又穿过厨房，把灯关掉，然后在黑暗中站了一会儿，思考着，想喝杯酒。刹那间，饭店似乎响起了成百上千种鬼鬼祟祟的声音：嘎吱嘎吱声、呻吟声、屋檐下风的呜咽声。也许，屋檐上还吊着更多的像催命果一样的黄蜂窝。">查看中文翻译</div>
