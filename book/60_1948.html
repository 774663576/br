<div class="line_en">This is how it goes: A certain Dembscher owed Beethoven fifty florins, and when the composer, who was chronically short of funds, reminded him of the debt, Dembscher heaved a mournful sigh and said, Muss es sein? To which Beethoven replied, with a hearty laugh, Es muss sein! and immediately jotted down these words and their melody. On this realistic motif he then composed a canon for four voices: three voices sing Es muss sein, es muss sein, ja, ja, ja, ja! (It must be, it must be, yes, yes, yes, yes!), and the fourth voice chimes in with Heraus mit dem Beutel! (Out with the purse!).</div>

<div class="line_en">A year later, the same motif showed up as the basis for the fourth movement of the last quartet, Opus 155. By that time, Beethoven had forgotten about Dembscher's purse. The words Es muss sein! had acquired a much more solemn ring; they seemed to issue directly from the lips of Fate. In Kant's language, even Good morning, suitably pronounced, can take the shape of a metaphysical thesis.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一年之后，在他编号为一三五的最后一部四重奏的第四章里，这一动机成为了核心动机。这时，贝多芬想的不再是登普金的钱袋。“es muss sein”这几个字对他来说已经具备越来越庄严的调子，仿佛是命运之神的亲口召唤。一句话，若出自于康德，哪怕是一声“早安”，要是说得到位，听起来也可能像是一个形而上学的命题。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Even though he came to love Beethoven through Tereza, Tomas was not particularly knowledgeable about music, and I doubt that he knew the true story behind Beethoven's famous Muss es sein? Es muss sein! motif.</div>

<div class="line_en">German is a language of heavy words. Es muss sein! was no longer a joke; it had become der schwer gefasste Entschluss (the difficult or weighty resolution).</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="德语是一种词语沉重的语言。“es muss sein”根本已不再是一个玩笑，而是“der schwer gefasste Entschluss”，细加掂量的决断。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It is my feeling that Tomas had long been secretly irritated by the stern, aggressive, solemn Es muss sein! and that he harbored a deep desire to follow the spirit of Parmenides and make heavy go to light. Remember that at one point in his life he broke completely with his first wife and his son and that he was relieved when both his parents broke with him. What could be at the bottom of it all but a rash and not quite rational move to reject what proclaimed itself to be his weighty duty, his Es muss sein!'?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我相信，托马斯在自己内心深处，早已十分恼火这一庄重、严肃、逼人的“es muss sein”，于是在他身上产生了一种对改变的深切渴望，渴望按照巴门尼德的精神，把重变为轻。我们还记得当初他片刻内就作了决断，永世不见第一任妻子和他的儿子，而且当他得知父母与他断绝关系，反倒松了口气。要推开那试图压到他身上的沉重责任，推开那“es muss sein”，除了采取这突然且不合常理的举动，还会有什么呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So Beethoven turned a frivolous inspiration into a serious quartet, a joke into metaphysical truth. It is an interesting tale of light going to heavy or, as Parmenides would have it, positive going to negative. Yet oddly enough, the transformation fails to surprise us. We would have been shocked, on the other hand, if Beethoven had transformed the seriousness of his quartet into the trifling joke of a four-voice canon about Dembscher's purse. Had he done so, however, he would have been in the spirit of Parmenides and made heavy go to light, that is, negative to positive! First (as an unfinished sketch) would have come the great metaphysical truth and last (as a finished masterpiece) -- the most frivolous of jokes! But we no longer know how to think as Parmenides thought.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="贝多芬就这样将诙谐的灵感谱成了严肃的四重奏，将一句玩笑变成了形而上学的真理。这是一个很有趣的由轻到重（也就是巴门尼德的正负变化之说）的例子。奇怪的是，我们似乎并没对这样的转变表示出惊讶。如果倒过来，贝多芬将严肃的四重奏变成关于登普金还钱的无聊笑话的四重唱，想必定会引起我们的愤怒。然而这却是符合巴门尼德精神的，因为他把重变成了轻，把负变成了正！最初（作为一支没完成的短曲）表现了伟大的形而上学的真理，而最终（作为完成了的作品）却只是再无聊不过的玩笑？！我们已经再也不会像巴门尼德那样思考了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The day he reported to the good-natured woman responsible for the cleanliness of all shop windows and display cases in Prague, and was confronted with the result of his decision in all its concrete and inescapable reality, he went into a state of shock, a state that kept him in its thrall during the first few days of his new job. But once he got over the astounding strangeness of his new life (it took him about a week), he suddenly realized he was simply on a long holiday.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，当托马斯去报到，面对和善的布拉格玻璃窗及橱窗清洗店女老板的时候，他的那个决断的后果便突然向他展现了其全部的现实，他几乎惊惶失措。在惊恐中，托马斯度过了打工的头几天。而一旦克服了（大约一周以后）新生活令人惊恐的陌生感，托马斯猛然意识到自己等于是在放长假。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Being a surgeon means slitting open the surface of things and looking at what lies hidden inside. Perhaps Tomas was led to surgery by a desire to know what lies hidden on the other side of Es muss sein!. in other words, what remains of life when a person rejects what he previously considered his mission.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当外科医生，即是切开事物的表面去看看藏在里面的东西。也许正是这样的渴望推动着托马斯去看看在“es muss sein”之外到底还有什么。换句话说，要去看一看当一个人抛弃了所有他一直都以为是使命的东西时，生命中还能剩下些什么。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That, of course, was an external Es muss sein! reserved for him by social convention, whereas the Es muss sein! of his love for medicine was internal. So much the worse for him. Internal imperatives are all the more powerful and therefore all the more of an inducement to revolt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="显然，这是一种外在的，由社会习俗强加到他身上的“es muss sein”，而他对于医学的热爱这一“es muss sein”则是内在的必然。而恰恰这样更糟糕。因为内心的必然总是更强烈，总是更强力地刺激着我们走向反叛。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Here he was, doing things he didn't care a damn about, and enjoying it. Now he understood what made people (people he always pitied) happy when they took a job without feeling the compulsion of an internal Es muss sein! and forgot it the moment they left for home every evening. This was the first time he had felt that blissful indifference. Whenever anything went wrong on the operating table, he would be despondent and unable to sleep. He would even lose his taste for women. The Es muss sein! of his profession had been like a vampire sucking his blood.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="做的是自己完全不在乎的事，真美。从事的不是内心的“es muss sein”逼着去做的职业，一下班，就可把工作丢在脑后，托马斯终于体会到了这些人的幸福（而从前他总是对他们心存怜悯）。在这之前，他还从来没有感受过不在乎带来的快乐。以往每当手术没有如他所愿，出了问题，他就会绝望，会睡不着觉，甚至对女人都提不起兴致。职业的“es muss sein”就像吸血鬼一样吸他的血。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now he roamed the streets of Prague with brush and pole, feeling ten years younger. The salesgirls all called him doctor (the Prague bush telegraph was working better than ever) and asked his advice about their colds, aching backs, and irregular periods. They seemed almost embarrassed to watch him douse the glass with water, fit the brush on the end of the pole, and start washing. If they could have left their customers alone in the shops, they would surely have grabbed the pole from his hands and washed the windows for him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如今，他整天扛着长杆穿过布拉格的街巷去擦洗橱窗玻璃，吃惊地发觉自己感觉年轻了十岁。大商场的女售货员还管他叫“大夫”（布拉格的达姆达姆鼓敲得还是尽善尽美），并常常跟他咨询些感冒、背痛和经期不正常等毛病。每当看到托马斯往橱窗玻璃上喷水、用绑在长杆上的刷子开始清洗玻璃，女售货员总感到不好意思。要是能扔下店里的顾客不管，她们肯定会接过托马斯手中的长杆，替他擦洗。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tereza was suddenly out of his life. The only times he saw her were when she came back from the bar late at night and he woke befuddled from a half-sleep, and in the morning, when she was the befuddled one and he was hurrying off to work. Each workday, he had sixteen hours to himself, an unexpected field of freedom. And from Tomas's early youth that had meant women.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特蕾莎几乎突然消失了，托马斯只有每天夜里才能见到她，当她从酒吧回到家，托马斯已经睡眼朦胧，而早晨，特蕾莎还沉睡时，托马斯又得早起赶去干活。所以每天他有十六个小时是自己的，简直是意外地给他送上了一片自由空间。而对托马斯来说，从他还很年轻的时候起，自由空间就意味着女人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Most of Tomas's orders came from large shops, but his boss sent him out to private customers, too. People were still reacting to the mass persecution of Czech intellectuals with the euphoria of solidarity, and when his former patients found out that Tomas was washing windows for a living, they would phone in and order him by name. Then they would greet him with a bottle of champagne or slivovitz, sign for thirteen windows on the order slip, and chat with him for two hours, drinking his health all the while. Tomas would move on to his next flat or shop in a capital mood. While the families of Russian officers settled in throughout the land and radios intoned ominous reports of police functionaries who had replaced cashiered broadcasters, Tomas reeled through the streets of Prague from one glass of wine to the next like someone going from party to party. It was his grand holiday.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="托马斯主要是擦大百货店的玻璃，不过有时也会被老板派到别人家里。在那个时期，捷克人还是比较团结的，群情激奋，反对迫害知识分子。于是当托马斯以前的病人听说他当了玻璃擦洗工，纷纷打电话到清洗公司指名要求他擦玻璃。而托马斯一到，他们就以香槟或是烈酒招待，先在工作单上签好字，说他擦了多少多少扇窗户，然后便喝喝聊聊度过两个小时。所以托马斯无论是去私人家里还是去商场，都会感到心情舒畅。那时俄国军官的家庭已经开始在这个国家安家，内务部的官员代替了电台被解职的播音员，收音机里整日是些吓唬人的讲话，而托马斯摇摇晃晃地穿过布拉格城的街巷，由一家喝到另一家，像过不完的节，很开心。真是给他放了大假。">查看中文翻译</div>
