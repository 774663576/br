<div class="line_en">Her life was very lonely now. She saw Becky every day, of course, but they did not have much time for talking. The cook and the other servants were not friendly. Sometimes, at night, Ermengarde came up to Sara's room, but it was not easy for her to come often.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr Carrisford looked into the fire. "Ram Dass tells me," he said, "about a little servant-girl next door. The monkey ran away, and Ram Dass went across the roof to get him back from her room. The poor child sleeps in a cold, dirty attic, and works about sixteen hours a day. Is Ralph's daughter living like that? I can't stop thinking about it."</div>

<div class="line_en">Winter came, with its short, dark days, and the attic rooms were very cold. There were no fires for servant girls, and often Sara and Becky could not sleep because of the cold.

She did not get very much to eat, and she was always hungry.</div>
