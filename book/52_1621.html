<div class="line_en">I'm sorry, Peeta, I think. I'm sorry I couldn't save you. Save him? More likely I stole his last chance at life, condemned him, by destroying the force field. Maybe, if we had all played by the rules, they might have let him live.</div>

I can't think why the sky's being bombed until I realize the Gamemakers are shooting off fireworks up there, while the real destruction occurs on the ground.

<div class="line_en">My worst fears are confirmed when the face that greets me inside the hovercraft belongs to Plutarch Heavensbee, Head Gamemaker. What a mess I have made of his beautiful Games with the clever ticking clock and the field of victors. He will suffer for his failure, probably lose his life, but not before he sees me punished. His hand reaches for me, I think to strike me, but he does something worse. With his thumb and his forefinger, he slides my eyelids shut, sentencing me to the vulnerability of darkness. They can do anything to me now and I will not even see it coming.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当我看到飞机里的人是普鲁塔什·海文斯比－－赛组委会主席时，我的恐惧得到证实。他很聪明地把竞技场设计成了一个嘀嗒作响的大钟，而我却把他美丽的竞技场搞得天翻地覆，他会为自己的失败付出代价，也许会丢掉性命，但却是在我受到惩罚之后。他把手伸向我，我以为他要打我，可他却做了更糟的事，盖上了我的眼皮，让我坠入黑暗之中。他们现在可以对我做任何事，而我甚至在此之前看不到它的到来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The hovercraft materializes above me without warning. If it was quiet, and a mockingjay perched close at hand, I would have heard the jungle go silent and then the bird's call that precedes the appearance of the Capitol's aircraft. But my ears could never make out anything so delicate in this bombardment.</div>

<div class="line_en">When I swim back into semiconsciousness, I can feel I'm lying on a padded table. There's the pinching sensation of tubes in my left arm. They are trying to keep me alive because, if I slide quietly, privately into death, it will be a victory. I'm still largely unable to move, open my eyelids, raise my head. But my right arm has regained a little motion. It flops across my body, feeling like a flipper, no, something less animated, like a club. I have no real motor coordination, no proof that I even still have fingers. Yet I manage to swing my arm around until I rip the tubes out. A beeping goes off but I can't stay awake to find out who it will summon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当我再次迷迷糊糊醒过来的时候，感到自己躺在一张带垫子的桌子上。我的左臂正在打吊针，隐隐作痛。他们正在设法让我活下去，因为如果我静悄悄地死掉了，就等于我取得了胜利。我的身体机能还没有完全恢复，只能睁开眼睛，抬抬头。我的右臂恢复了一点知觉，它无力地垂在我胸前，就像鱼鳍，不，没那么好，像一根木棍。它还不能做出协调的动作，我甚至感觉不到自己是否还有手指。但是，我使劲晃动手臂，最后还是设法把输液管拔了下来。之后，警报铃响起，我没有看到铃声叫来的人，就又晕了过去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The next time I surface, my hands are tied down to the table, the tubes back in my arm. I can open my eyes and lift my head slightly, though. I'm in a large room with low ceilings and a silvery light. There are two rows of beds facing each other. I can hear the breathing of what I assume are my fellow victors. Directly across from me I see Beetee with about ten different machines hooked up to him. Just let us die! I scream in my mind. I slam my head back hard on the table and go out again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等我再醒过来的时候，我的手臂被绑在桌子上，胳膊上又插入了针头。我可以睁开眼睛，略微抬起头。我在一个很大的房间里，天花板很低，四周一片银白色。两排床对着摆放，我可以听到呼吸声，我猜是我的同伴。在我对面，我看到比特身上连接着大约十种不同的仪器。就让我们死去吧！我在心里呼喊。我使劲把头部撞在桌子上，之后又晕了过去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a plan to break us out of the arena from the moment the Quell was announced. The victor tributes from 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, and 11 had varying degrees of knowledge about it. Plutarch Heavensbee has been, for several years, part of an undercover group aiming to overthrow the Capitol. He made sure the wire was among the weapons. Beetee was in charge of blowing a hole in the force field. The bread we received in the arena was code for the time of the rescue. The district where the bread originated indicated the day. Three. The number of rolls the hour. Twenty-four. The hovercraft belongs to District 13. Bonnie and Twill, the women I met in the woods from 8, were right about its existence and its defense capabilities. We are currently on a very roundabout journey to District 13. Meanwhile, most of the districts in Panem are in full-scale rebellion.</div>

<div class="line_en">Technically, I am unarmed. But no one should ever underestimate the harm that fingernails can do, especially if the target is unprepared. I lunge across the table and rake mine down Haymitch's face, causing blood to flow and damage to one eye. Then we are both screaming terrible, terrible things at each other, and Finnick is trying to drag me out, and I know it's all Haymitch can do not to rip me apart, but I'm the mockingjay. I'm the mockingjay and it's too hard keeping me alive as it is.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="照理说，我已经没有了武器，可指甲也是厉害的武器，特别是在对方没有丝毫准备的情况下。我越过桌子，用指甲狠抓黑密斯的脸，他的脸上立刻流出血来，一只眼睛也抓伤了。之后，我们两个人都大喊着咒骂对方，芬尼克赶紧把我往屋子外面拽。我知道黑密斯是强忍着怒火才没把我撕成碎片。可我是嘲笑鸟。嘲笑鸟就是很不容易养活的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The others kept Peeta alive because if he died, we knew there'd be no keeping you in an alliance," says Haymitch. "And we couldn't risk leaving you unprotected."
