<div class="line_en">Next day he got up early to make the room ready for Mildred. He told the woman who had looked after him that he would not want her any more. Mildred came about six, and Philip, who was watching from the window, went down to let her in and help her to bring up the luggage: it consisted now of no more than three large parcels wrapped in brown paper, for she had been obliged to sell everything that was not absolutely needful. She wore the same black silk dress she had worn the night before, and, though she had now no rouge on her cheeks, there was still about her eyes the black which remained after a perfunctory wash in the morning: it made her look very ill. She was a pathetic figure as she stepped out of the cab with the baby in her arms. She seemed a little shy, and they found nothing but commonplace things to say to one another.</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip showed her the room. It was that in which Cronshaw had died. Philip, though he thought it absurd, had never liked the idea of going back to it; and since Cronshaw's death he had remained in the little room, sleeping on a fold-up bed, into which he had first moved in order to make his friend comfortable. The baby was sleeping placidly.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mildred went into the bedroom to undo her things and put them away. Philip tried to read, but his spirits were too high: he leaned back in his chair, smoking a cigarette, and with smiling eyes looked at the sleeping child. He felt very happy. He was quite sure that he was not at all in love with Mildred. He was surprised that the old feeling had left him so completely; he discerned in himself a faint physical repulsion from her; and he thought that if he touched her it would give him goose-flesh. He could not understand himself. Presently, knocking at the door, she came in again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="米尔德里德走进卧室，把带来的包裹打开，东西一样样拿出来。菲利普想看会儿书，但怎么也平静不下来。他靠在椅背上，抽着烟，笑盈盈地看着熟睡的孩子。他觉得幸福。他非常确定自己已经完全不爱米尔德里德了。甚至连他也没想到，自己竟能把过去对她的感情忘得干干净净。一想到她的样子只觉得有点反胃，一想到触碰她的身体，就浑身起鸡皮疙瘩。他也不知道这是怎么了。正纳闷，米尔德里德敲了敲客厅的门，走了进来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She did not answer, but tears rolled heavily down her cheeks. Philip knew from his experience at the hospital that women of her class looked upon service as degrading: he could not help feeling a little impatient with her; but he blamed himself, for it was clear that she was tired and ill. He got up and helped her to lay another place at the table. The baby was awake now, and Mildred had prepared some Mellin's Food for it. The liver and bacon were ready and they sat down. For economy's sake Philip had given up drinking anything but water, but he had in the house a half a bottle of whiskey, and he thought a little would do Mildred good. He did his best to make the supper pass cheerfully, but Mildred was subdued and exhausted. When they had finished she got up to put the baby to bed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="米尔德里德没说话，大颗泪水顺着脸颊重重砸下来。菲利普通过在医院和病人的接触，了解到她这个阶级的女人都觉得给别人帮佣是件很丢脸的事。他看她又哭起来，心里有些不耐烦。但再一打量，那副弱不禁风的疲惫样子让他又莫名自责。他站起来帮着把另一块餐巾铺好。孩子醒了，米尔德里德早就给她准备好了辅食。猪肝和咸肉一做好，他们就坐下来准备吃饭。为了省钱，菲利普已经戒酒只喝凉白开。他家倒是还有半瓶威士忌，也许喝点酒对米尔德里德有好处。他尽可能地让这顿饭愉快一些，可米尔德里德却一直阴沉着脸，好像已经累坏了。吃过饭后，她先把孩子抱上床。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip lit his pipe and began to read. It was pleasant to hear somebody moving about in the next room. Sometimes his loneliness had oppressed him. Mildred came in to clear the table, and he heard the clatter of plates as she washed up. Philip smiled as he thought how characteristic it was of her that she should do all that in a black silk dress. But he had work to do, and he brought his book up to the table. He was reading Osler's Medicine, which had recently taken the place in the students' favour of Taylor's work, for many years the text-book most in use. Presently Mildred came in, rolling down her sleeves. Philip gave her a casual glance, but did not move; the occasion was curious, and he felt a little nervous. He feared that Mildred might imagine he was going to make a nuisance of himself, and he did not quite know how without brutality to reassure her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普点上烟斗，翻开一本书。米尔德里德走来走去的声音从隔壁房间传来，让他心里非常快活。之前一个人在家时，孤独时常压得他喘不过气。米尔德里德走进来收拾桌子。他听见她洗盘子时，杯盏乒乒乓乓碰在一起的响声，想到她穿着黑色的丝裙做家务，真是别有一番独特风情。他还想再学会儿，于是拿着书坐到桌边。他正在研读奥斯勒的《内科学》，这本书已经取代泰勒编的教科书，成了学生们的新宠。在它之前，医学生的教科书一直是泰勒编的。米尔德里德干完活儿进屋来了，她把袖子卷下来。菲利普朝她瞥了一眼，一动没动。这样的情况很是古怪，他不由得紧张起来。米尔德里德也许会以为自己想要纠缠她不放，可他也不知道如何让她把心放回肚子里。">查看中文翻译</div>
