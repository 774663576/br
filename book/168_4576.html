<div class="line_en">When he turned, she was standing behind him, with half a dozen queen's men around her. Small wonder the yard grew so quiet. He had glimpsed Melisandre at her nightfires, and coming and going about the castle, but never so close. She's beautiful, he thought… but there was something more than a little unsettling about red eyes. "my lady."</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's as heavy as it needs to be to stop a sword," Jon said. "Now get it up." He stepped forward, slashing. Satin jerked the shield up in time to catch the sword on its rim, and swung his own blade at Jon's ribs. "Good," Jon said, when he felt the impact on his own shield. "That was good. But you need to put your body into it. Get your weight behind the steel and you'll do more damage than with arm strength alone. Come, try it again, drive at me, but keep the shield up or I'll ring your head like a bell…"</div>

<div class="line_en">Melisandre was waiting for him at the base of the Wall. She had sent her queen's men away. "What does His Grace want of me?" Jon asked her as they entered the cage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="梅莉珊卓在长城脚下等他，她已把后党人士统统打发走了。“陛下有什么需要我效劳的？”走进铁笼时，琼恩问。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He hung his mail and plate inside the armory, returned to his own cell, discarded his sweat-stained clothes, and donned a fresh set of blacks. It would be cold and windy in the cage, he knew, and colder and windier still on top of the ice, so he chose a heavy hooded cloak. Last of all he collected Longclaw, and slung the bastard sword across his back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他将锁甲和板甲挂在军械库里，回到房间，脱下沾染汗渍的衣服，穿上一套新洗的黑衣。他知道铁笼里寒风凛冽，冰墙之上则更为凄冷，风力也大，因此加了一件带兜帽的厚重斗篷。最后，他拿起佩剑长爪，挂在背后。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He shut the door and pulled the bell cord. The winch began to turn. They rose. The day was bright and the Wall was weeping, long fingers of water trickling down its face and glinting in the sun. In the close confines of the iron cage, he was acutely aware of the red woman's presence. She even smells red. The scent reminded him of Mikken's forge, of the way iron smelled when red-hot; the scent was smoke and blood. Kissed by fire, he thought, remembering Ygritte. The wind got in amongst Melisandre's long red robes and sent them flapping against Jon's legs as he stood beside her. "You are not cold, my lady?" he asked her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他关上门，拉了传唤铃，绞盘便开始转动，带动笼子上升。天气晴朗，长城哭泣，水滴在冰墙表面流淌，拖着长长的轨迹，在阳光下闪烁。铁笼狭窄的空间内，他清晰而强烈地觉察到红袍女的压迫力。她闻起来都是红色。那气味让他联想起密肯的炉子，炽热的钢铁淬火的味道。火吻而生，他不由得又记起耶哥蕊特。琼恩就在梅莉珊卓身旁，寒风吹得她长长的红袍在他脚边拍打鼓动。“您不冷吗，夫人？”他问她。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Stannis turned to study him. Beneath his heavy brow were eyes like bottomless blue pools. His hollow cheeks and strong jaw were covered with a short-cropped blue-black beard that did little to conceal the gauntness of his face, and his teeth were clenched. His neck and shoulders were clenched as well, and his right hand. Jon found himself remembering something Donal Noye once said about the Baratheon brothers. Robert was the true steel. Stannis is pure iron, black and hard and strong, but brittle, the way iron gets. He'll break before he bends. Uneasily, he knelt, wondering why this brittle king had need of him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="史坦尼斯转身打量他。浓密的眉毛下，他有一对如蓝色水池般深不见底的眼睛，凹陷的颧骨和棱角分明的方下巴覆盖着一层又短又齐的蓝黑胡子，却难以掩盖面容的憔悴。他咬紧牙关，右手成拳，连脖子和肩膀也绷紧，令琼恩不由得记起唐纳·诺伊的评价：如果说劳勃是真钢，那史坦尼斯就是纯铁，又黑又硬又坚强，却也容易损坏，和铁一样，弯曲之前就会先断掉。他不安地跪下，寻思这个倔强的纯铁国王需要他做什么。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She laughed. "Never." The ruby at her throat seemed to pulse, in time with the beating of her heart. "The Lord's fire lives within me, Jon Snow. Feel." She put her hand on his cheek, and held it there while he felt how warm she was. "That is how life should feel," she told him. "Only death is cold."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她报以微笑。“从不，”她喉际的血红宝石仿佛随心跳而脉动，“真主之火在我体内燃烧，琼恩·雪诺，感受一下。”她伸手贴在他脸颊上，让他感觉她身体的温度。“生命即是火热，”她告诉他，“冰冷属于死亡。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They found Stannis Baratheon standing alone at the edge of the Wall, brooding over the field where he had won his battle, and the great green forest beyond. He was dressed in the same black breeches, tunic, and boots that a brother of the Night's Watch might wear. Only his cloak set him apart; a heavy golden cloak trimmed in black fur, and pinned with a brooch in the shape of a flaming heart. "I have brought you the Bastard of Winterfell, Your Grace," said Melisandre.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩独自站在长城边缘沉思，面对着他获胜的平原和远处绿色的大森林。他身穿黑色的上衣、马裤和靴子，几乎与守夜人弟兄毫无二致，只有披风醒目；那是件厚重的金色披风，边缘镶黑毛皮，用烈焰红心的胸针别住。“我把临冬城的私生子带来了，陛下。”梅莉珊卓道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我不是大人，陛下。”琼恩站起身，“我知道您听说了什么。我是个变色龙和胆小鬼；我杀了自己的弟兄‘断掌’科林，以保全性命；我跟曼斯·雷德一起骑行，还娶了个野人老婆。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Stannis snorted. "I know Janos Slynt. And I knew Ned Stark as well. Your father was no friend of mine, but only a fool would doubt his honor or his honesty. You have his look." A big man, Stannis Baratheon towered over Jon, but he was so gaunt that he looked ten years older than he was. "I know more than you might think, Jon Snow. I know it was you who found the dragonglass dagger that Randyll Tarly's son used to slay the Other."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="史坦尼斯哼了一声。“我了解杰诺斯·史林特，也了解艾德·史塔克。你父亲非我之友，但只有傻瓜才会怀疑他的荣誉和忠诚。你继承了他的容貌。”史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩高高在上，耸立在琼恩上方，但他如此憔悴，看上去比实际年龄老十岁。“我知道的事比你想象的多得多，琼恩·雪诺。我知道是你找到了龙晶匕首，蓝道·塔利的儿子用它来杀死异鬼。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"And I mine. Yet they were what they were, and so are we. I am the only true king in Westeros, north or south. And you are Ned Stark's bastard." Stannis studied him with those dark blue eyes. "Tywin Lannister has named Roose Bolton his Warden of the North, to reward him for betraying your brother. The ironmen are fighting amongst themselves since Balon Greyjoy's death, yet they still hold Moat Cailin, Deepwood Motte, Torrhen's Square, and most of the Stony Shore. Your father's lands are bleeding, and I have neither the strength nor the time to stanch the wounds. What is needed is a Lord of Winterfell. A loyal Lord of Winterfell."</div>

<div class="line_en">When Jon had been very young, too young to understand what it meant to be a bastard, he used to dream that one day Winterfell. might be his. Later, when he was older, he had been ashamed of those dreams. Winterfell. would go to Robb and then his sons, or to Bran or Rickon should Robb die childless. And after them came Sansa and Arya. Even to dream otherwise seemed disloyal, as if he were betraying them in his heart, wishing for their deaths. I never wanted this, he thought as he stood before the blue-eyed king and the red woman. I loved Robb, loved an of them… I never wanted any harm to come to any of them, but it did. And now there's only me. All he had to do was say the word, and he would be Jon Stark, and nevermore a Snow. All he had to do was pledge this king his fealty, and Winterfell was his. All he had to do…</div>

<div class="line_en">King Stannis gazed off north again, his gold cloak streaming from his shoulders. "It may be that I am mistaken in you, Jon Snow. We both know the things that are said of bastards. You may lack your father's honor, or your brother's skill in arms. But you are the weapon the Lord has given me. I have found you here, as you found the cache of dragonglass beneath the Fist, and I mean to make use of you. Even Azor Ahai did not win his war alone. I killed a thousand wildlings, took another thousand captive, and scattered the rest, but we both know they will return. Melisandre has seen that in her fires. This Tormund Thunderfist is likely re-forming them even now, and planning some new assault. And the more we bleed each other, the weaker we shall all be when the real enemy falls upon us."</div>

He never thought of settling it with wildlings, though… but he never rode with wildlings, either. He did not fool himself; the free folk would make for unruly subjects and dangerous neighbors.

The one who calls himself the Lord of Bones, some of their clan chiefs, the new Magnar of Therm. Your brothers will not like it, no more than your father's lords, but I mean to allow the wildlings through the Wall… those who will swear me their fealty, pledge to keep the king's peace and the king's laws, and take the Lord of Light as their god. Even the giants, if those great knees of theirs can bend. I will settle them on the Gift, once I have wrested it away from your new Lord Commander.
