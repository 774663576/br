<div class="line_en">The boy had been working for the crystal merchant for almost a month, and he could see that it wasn't exactly the kind of job that would make him happy. The merchant spent the entire day mumbling behind the counter, telling the boy to be careful with the pieces and not to break anything.</div>

<div class="line_en">But the merchant understood what the boy had said. The boy's very presence in the shop was an omen, and, as time passed and money was pouring into the cash drawer, he had no regrets about having hired the boy. The boy was being paid more money than he deserved, because the merchant, thinking that sales wouldn't amount to much, had offered the boy a high commission rate. He had assumed he would soon return to his sheep.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="店主没说话，沉默了一会儿之后，说：“先知赐予我们古兰经，给我们留下了五项戒律，要我们一生遵行。其中最重要的一项是，真神只有一个。此外还有，每天祈祷五次，斋月的时候要禁食，面对穷人乐善好施。”">查看中文翻译</div>

I thought that someday I'd be rich, and could go to Mecca. I began to make some money, but I could never bring myself to leave someone in charge of the shop; the crystals are delicate things. At the same time, people were passing my shop all the time, heading for Mecca. Some of them were rich pilgrims, traveling in caravans with servants and camels, but most of the people making the pilgrimage were poorer than I.</div>

<div class="line_en">Two more months passed, and the shelf brought many customers into the crystal shop. The boy estimated that, if he worked for six more months, he could return to Spain and buy sixty sheep, and yet another sixty. In less than a year, he would have doubled his flock, and he would be able to do business with the Arabs, because he was now able to speak their strange language. Since that morning in the marketplace, he had never again made use of Urim and Thummim, because Egypt was now just as distant a dream for him as was Mecca for the merchant.

<div class="line_en">The desert was all sand in some stretches, and rocky in others. When the caravan was blocked by a boulder, it had to go around it; if there was a large rocky area, they had to make a major detour. If the sand was too fine for the animals' hooves, they sought a way where the sand was more substantial. In some places, the ground was covered with the salt of dried-up lakes. The animals balked at such places, and the camel drivers were forced to dismount and unburden their charges.

<div class="line_en">At that moment, it seemed to him that time stood still, and the Soul of the World surged within him. When he looked into her dark eyes, and saw that her lips were poised between a laugh and silence, he learned the most important part of the language that all the world spoke -- the language that everyone on earth was capable of understanding in their heart. It was love. Something older than humanity, more ancient than the desert. Something that exerted the same force whenever two pairs of eyes met, as had theirs here at the well. She smiled, and that was certainly an omen -- the omen he had been awaiting, without even knowing he was, for all his life. The omen he had sought to find with his sheep and in his books, in the crystals and in the silence of the desert.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此时，时间仿佛在刹那间停止，世界之魂蓦然出现在圣地亚哥面前。当男孩看见少女那双黑色的眼睛，看见她似笑非笑的面容，似启非启的双唇，他明白了世上最重要和最智慧的表达方式，也就是人类都能理解的语言。这就是所谓的爱情。它比沙漠和人还要长久，无论在什么地方，只要男女四目相对—就像此刻在这眼水井旁边一样，爱情就会以同样的力量爆发出来。少女的嘴角终于浮现出一丝微笑，这是一个预兆，是男孩今生今世在冥冥中苦苦期待的一个预兆，是男孩在羊群、书籍、水晶器皿以及沙漠的寂静中苦苦寻觅的一个预兆。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was the pure Language of the World. It required no explanation, just as the universe needs none as it travels through endless time. What the boy felt at that moment was that he was in the presence of the only woman in his life, and that, with no need for words, she recognized the same thing. He was more certain of it than of anything in the world. He had been told by his parents and grandparents that he must fall in love and really know a person before becoming committed. But maybe people who felt that way had never learned the universal language. Because, when you know that language, it's easy to understand that someone in the world awaits you, whether it's in the middle of the desert or in some great city. And when two such people encounter each other, and their eyes meet, the past and the future become unimportant. There is only that moment, and the incredible certainty that everything under the sun has been written by one hand only. It is the hand that evokes love, and creates a twin soul for every person in the world. Without such love, one's dreams would have no meaning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是世界上最纯正的表达方式，无需解释，就像地球在无限的太空中不停地运行无需任何解释。那一刻，男孩唯一明白的是，他正站在他生命中的女人面前，什么话都不需要说，她肯定也明白这一点。别的事情不好说，但在这件事上，男孩坚信不疑，尽管他的父母以及先辈都说过，必须在恋爱、订婚、相互了解和有了钱之后才可以结婚。说这话的人大概从来不了解宇宙的语言，因为如果掌握了这种语言，很容易就能理解，世上总有人在等待着另外一个人，无论是在大沙漠还是在大城市。当这两个人最终相遇，四目相对的时候，过去的一切和将来的一切全都变得无足轻重了，只有眼前的这一刻最重要。还有那不可思议的事实：朗朗乾坤下的一切，都是由同一只手写就。那是一只唤醒爱情的手，一只为那些在天底下工作、休息、寻找宝藏的人们造就相同灵魂的手。假如没有这一切，人类的所有梦想都将失去意义。">查看中文翻译</div>

What kind of blow should one deliver next in order to remain alive? The camel driver was not a fighter, and he had consulted with seers.

"We, people's hearts, seldom say much about those treasures, because people no longer want to go in search of them. We speak of them only to children.

<div class="line_en">"No," the alchemist answered. "What you still need to know is this: before a dream is realized, the Soul of the World tests everything that was learned along the way. It does this not because it is evil, but so that we can, in addition to realizing our dreams, master the lessons we've learned as we've moved toward that dream. That's the point at which most people give up. It's the point at which, as we say in the language of the desert, one 'dies of thirst just when the palm trees have appeared on the horizon.' Every search begins with beginner's luck. And every search ends with the victor's being severely tested."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不。”炼金术士回答，“你需要知道的事情是：在实现一个梦想之前，世界之魂永远都会对寻梦者途中所学到的一切进行检验。这种做法并无恶意，仅仅是为了不让我们远离梦想，并让我们获得寻梦过程中学到的经验教训。这是大多数人可能会放弃寻梦的一个时刻。用沙漠的语言，我们称之为‘渴死在椰枣树出现在地平线上的时刻’。每个人的寻梦过程都是以‘新手的运气’为开端，又总是以‘对远征者的考验’收尾。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You are wise, because you observe everything from a distance," the boy said. "But you don't know about love. If there hadn't been a sixth day, man would not exist; copper would always be just copper, and lead just lead.

But later, I could see that it was like other aspects of creation, and had its own passions and wars. It is we who nourish the Soul of the World, and the world we live in will be either better or worse, depending on whether we become better or worse. And that's where the power of love comes in.

<div class="line_en">A current of love rushed from his heart, and the boy began to pray. It was a prayer that he had never said before, because it was a prayer without words or pleas. His prayer didn't give thanks for his sheep having found new pastures; it didn't ask that the boy be able to sell more crystal; and it didn't beseech that the woman he had met continue to await his return. In the silence, the boy understood that the desert, the wind, and the sun were also trying to understand the signs written by the hand, and were seeking to follow their paths, and to understand what had been written on a single emerald. He saw that omens were scattered throughout the earth and in space, and that there was no reason or significance attached to their appearance; he could see that not the deserts, nor the winds, nor the sun, nor people knew why they had been created. But that the hand had a reason for all of this, and that only the hand could perform miracles, or transform the sea into a desert… or a man into the wind. Because only the hand understood that it was a larger design that had moved the universe to the point at which six days of creation had evolved into a Master Work.</div>

<div class="line_en">But his heart was speaking of other things. With pride, it told the story of a shepherd who had left his flock to follow a dream he had on two different occasions. It told of Personal Legend, and of the many men who had wandered in search of distant lands or beautiful women, confronting the people of their times with their preconceived notions. It spoke of journeys, discoveries, books, and change.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，圣地亚哥的心却在讲述着别的事情。它骄傲地讲起了一个牧羊人的故事，那牧羊人为了追寻自己连续两个夜晚所做的同一个梦而抛弃了他的羊群。心还讲到天命，以及很多追寻天命的人。他们挑战那些带有时代偏见的人，前去寻找遥远的土地和漂亮的女人。在整个旅途过程中，心一直在谈论新的发现，谈论书籍和巨大的变化。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When he reached the top of the dune, his heart leapt. There, illuminated by the light of the moon and the brightness of the desert, stood the solemn and majestic Pyramids of Egypt.</div>

<div class="line_en">The boy climbed the dune slowly. A full moon rose again in the starry sky: it had been a month since he had set forth from the oasis. The moonlight cast shadows through the dunes, creating the appearance of a rolling sea; it reminded the boy of the day when that horse had reared in the desert, and he had come to know the alchemist. And the moon fell on the desert's silence, and on a man's journey in search of treasure.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="男孩慢慢向沙丘顶端爬去。一轮满月悬在中天，星光灿烂。他在沙漠中已经走了一个月了。月光洒在沙丘上，变幻的阴影令沙漠看上去像波涛滚滚的大海，男孩回忆起一匹马在沙漠里自由驰骋，为炼金术士带去好预兆的那一天。说到底，月亮照耀的是沙漠的静寂和寻宝者们的足迹。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But here he was, at the point of finding his treasure, and he reminded himself that no project is completed until its objective has been achieved. The boy looked at the sands around him, and saw that, where his tears had fallen, a scarab beetle was scuttling through the sand.

<div class="line_en">Another omen! The boy began to dig into the dune. As he did so, he thought of what the crystal merchant had once said: that anyone could build a pyramid in his backyard. The boy could see now that he couldn't do so if he placed stone upon stone for the rest of his life.</div>

In my dream, there was a sycamore growing out of the ruins of the sacristy, and I was told that, if I dug at the roots of the sycamore, I would find a hidden treasure.
