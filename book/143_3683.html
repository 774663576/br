<div class="line_en">Turi Guiliano and Aspanu Pisciotta were up before the dawn, before the first light, for though it was unlikely, the carabinieri might start in darkness to surprise them with the morning sun. They had seen the armored car from Palermo arrive in the Bellampo Barracks late the evening before with two jeeploads of reinforcements. During the night Guiliano made scouting patrols down the side of the mountain and listened for any sounds that would be made by anyone approaching their cliff -- a precaution Pisciotta ridiculed. "When we were children we would have been such daredevils," he told Guiliano, "but do you think those lazy carabinieri will risk their lives in darkness, or even miss a good night's sleep in soft beds?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黎明前，天还黑漆漆的，图里·吉里安诺和阿斯帕努就起来了，因为宪兵可能在天亮前摸黑对他们实施突然袭击，当然这种可能性不大。头天晚上已经很晚的时候，他们看见从巴勒莫来的一辆装甲车和两辆吉普车开进贝兰伯兵营进行增援。夜间，吉里安诺几次从山坡上下去侦察，静听有没有人攀缘峭壁的声音——对这样的防范措施，皮肖塔很不以为然。他对吉里安诺说：“要说我们小时候，那还真是天不怕地不怕呢。你觉得那些懒鬼宪兵会摸着黑，拿自己的性命来冒险，甚至错过在软和的床上睡个好觉？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We have to train ourselves into good habits," Turi Guiliano said. He knew that someday there would be better enemies.</div>

<div class="line_en">Turi and Aspanu worked hard laying out guns on a blanket and checking them in every detail. Then they ate some of La Venera's bread cake, washed down with a flask of wine Hector Adonis had left them. The cake, with its heat and spices, lay glowingly in their stomachs. It gave them the energy to construct a screen of saplings and boulders on the edge of the cliff. Behind this screen, they watched the town and the mountain paths with their binoculars. Guiliano loaded the guns and put boxes of ammunition into the pockets of his sheepskin jacket while Pisciotta kept watch. Guiliano did his job carefully and slowly. He even buried all the supplies and covered the ground with huge rocks himself. He was never to trust anyone to check these details. So it was Pisciotta who spotted the armored car leaving the Bellampo Barracks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="图里和阿斯帕努都把枪放在毯子上仔细检查。接着，他们吃起拉韦内拉做的饼，喝上一两口阿多尼斯留下的酒。那块饼又辣又香，吃到肚子里热乎乎的，给他们补充了能量。他们用树枝和石头在悬崖边上垒起一道矮墙，然后待在矮墙后面，用望远镜观察小镇和山路上的动静。皮肖塔负责警戒，吉里安诺则把子弹压进枪膛里，并把几盒弹药装进羊皮夹克的口袋。他的动作非常仔细，不紧不慢。他把所有的给养都埋进地下，搬来几块大石头压在上面。对于这些细节的检查，他从来不相信任何人。就在这时候，皮肖塔看见那辆装甲车离开了贝兰伯兵营。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You're right," Pisciotta said. "The car is going down the Castellammare plain away from us."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你说得对，”皮肖塔说，“那辆装甲车不是朝我们这里来，而是开向海堡平原方向。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In an hour the carabinieri would send a detachment up the sides to Monte d'Ora in a frontal attack to flush them out. It helped that the police thought of them as wild youths, simple outlaws. The scarlet and gold flag of Sicily that they flew from the cliff edge confirmed their careless impudence, or so the police would think.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个小时之内，宪兵会派一个小分队从奥拉山的侧面爬上来，对他们展开正面攻击，把他们赶出来。警察以为他们是行事鲁莽的青年，是头脑简单的土匪，这对他们来说倒是十分有利。他们插在悬崖边的红黄两色西西里旗恰恰可以说明他们的粗心和冒失，警察也许就是这么想的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">An hour later, a troop van and a jeep carrying the Maresciallo Roccofino left through the gates of the Bellampo Barracks. The two vehicles traveled leisurely to the foot of Monte d'Ora and stopped to unload. Twelve carabinieri armed with rifles deployed on the tiny paths that led up the slope. Maresciallo Roccofino took off his braided cap and pointed it toward the scarlet and gold flag flying over the cliff above them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个小时后，一辆运兵车和一辆吉普车从贝兰伯兵营开出。坐在吉普车上的是罗科菲诺上士。这两辆车不紧不慢地开到奥拉山的山脚，十二名手持步枪的宪兵跳下车，部署在几条通向斜坡的小路上。罗科菲诺上士脱下有饰带的帽子，用它指着他们头顶上方、在悬崖边飘扬的那面金红两色旗帜。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They grinned at each other. Guiliano felt a quiet elation. Fighting the police would not be so difficult after all. It was a child's game with a child's cunning. The armored car would disappear around a curve of the road and then circle back and come into the mountains to the rear of their cliff. The authorities must know about the tunnel and expect them to use it to escape and run right into the armored car. And its machine guns.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们相视而笑。吉里安诺一阵暗自得意。毕竟对付警察并不那么难，就像玩小孩子的游戏，只要有小孩子那点儿聪明就行了。那辆装甲车将在那条道路的转弯处消失，然后兜个圈子进入山里，来到他们所在悬崖的后面。当局肯定知道那条暗道，认为他们会从那里逃跑，这样他们就会自投罗网，直接撞上装甲车，撞到他们的机枪口上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Pisciotta laughed. "We always hated going home, remember? But I have to admit, this is more fun. Shall we kill a few of them?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮肖塔笑起来。“还记得吧，我们从来就不喜欢回家？不过我得承认，这样更有意思。我们是不是干掉几个？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Turi Guiliano was watching through the binoculars from behind the screen of saplings. For a moment he worried about the armored car on the other side of the mountain. Would they have sent some men up the opposite slope? But those men would take hours to climb, they could not be close. He put them out of his mind and said to Pisciotta, "Aspanu, if we're not as clever as we think, we won't be going home to our mothers and a plate of spaghetti this night, as we used to do when we were children."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="图里·吉里安诺此刻正从树枝掩体后面通过望远镜进行观察。他有些担心停在山另一侧的装甲车。他们会不会派人从那个山坡爬上来？不过那些人要爬上来也得好几个小时，现在不可能靠近他们。他暂时将他们抛在脑后，对皮肖塔说：“阿斯帕努，我们还是比较聪明的，否则我们今天晚上就不能回家，不能像小时候那样去见妈妈、吃面条了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They waited patiently for an hour. Then Guiliano pushed his shotgun through the screen of saplings and fired twice. It was amazing how that straight confident line of men scattered so quickly, like darting ants disappearing into the grass. Pisciotta fired his rifle four times. Smoke puffs appeared in different parts of the slope as the carabinieri fired back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们耐心地等了一个小时。吉里安诺把他的短筒猎枪从树枝形成的屏障后面伸出去开了两枪。令人惊讶的是，那一排信心十足的人就像蚂蚁一样迅速散开，消失在草丛中。皮肖塔用步枪打了四发子弹。宪兵开始还击，山坡上有好几个地方冒出了青烟。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No," Guiliano said. "Fire over their heads." He thought about how Pisciotta disobeyed him two nights before. He said, "Aspanu, obey me. There's no point in killing them. It can't serve any purpose this time."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，”吉里安诺说，“开枪打他们头顶上方。”他想起前天夜里皮肖塔没有服从他的命令，“阿斯帕努，听我的，没有必要杀他们，这样的杀戮没有任何意义。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Guiliano put down his shotgun and took up the binoculars. He could see the Maresciallo and his Sergeant working a radio communications set. They would be contacting the armored car on the other side of the mountain, warning them that the outlaws would be on their way. He picked up his shotgun again and fired twice, then said to Pisciotta, "It's time to leave."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉里安诺放下手中的短筒猎枪，拿起望远镜。他看见上士和他手下的中士在进行无线电联络。他们会与大山另一侧的装甲车联络，提醒他们土匪就要逃跑了。他抓起短筒猎枪，又打了两枪，然后对皮肖塔说：“该走了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The carabinieri were still firing up at the cliff, not realizing the two outlaws were now on their flanks. Guiliano led the way down a tiny, hidden path through massive boulders and entered a little forest. They rested for a few minutes and then they both started running down the path swiftly and silently. In less than an hour they emerged onto the plain that separated the mountains from the town of Montelepre, but they had circled around to the far side of the town; it lay between them and the troop-carrying van. They hid their weapons under their jackets and walked across the plain, looking like two peasants on their way to work in the fields. They entered Montelepre at the top of the Via Bella, only a hundred yards from the Bellampo Barracks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="宪兵仍在向峭壁方向开火，不知道这两个土匪已经绕到了他们的侧面。吉里安诺在前面，沿着大石头间的隐蔽通道进入一片小树林。稍事休息之后，他们又开始迅速而悄无声息地沿着小路向下跑。不到一个小时，他们就来到大山和蒙特莱普雷之间的那片开阔地。他们绕到小镇的另一端，那地方处于他们和那辆运兵车之间。他们把武器掖在上衣里，就像下地干活的农民一样，大摇大摆地穿过那片开阔地。他们来到贝拉大街的北端，从离贝兰伯兵营只有一百码的地方进入蒙特莱普雷。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The two of them crawled to the far side of the cliff out of view of the advancing carabinieri, then slid down the boulder-strewn slope, rolling for fifty yards before they came to their feet, weapons ready. Crouched low, they ran down the hill stopping only for Guiliano to observe the attackers through his binoculars.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们两人朝悬崖较远处爬去，爬到行进的宪兵看不见他们的地方，然后从布满大石头的斜坡上滑下去。下滑五十码后，他们站起来，把武器拿在手里，猫着腰沿山坡向下跑。吉里安诺偶尔停下来，通过望远镜观察那些攻击者。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Hector Adonis had followed Guiliano's instructions perfectly. At the top of the Via Bella was a painted cart, the ancient legends covering every inch, inside and out. Even the spokes of the wheels and the rims were painted with tiny armored figures so that when the wheels rolled they cleverly gave the illusion of men whirling in combat. The shafts too were colored in bright red curlicues with silver dots.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="赫克特·阿多尼斯完全按照吉里安诺的指示作准备，在贝拉大街的北侧停放了一辆画满古代传说故事的大车。就连车轮辐条和轮箍上都画着身穿盔甲的小人，这样车轮一转动，这些小人就像打仗一样翻滚起来。车辕上漆着鲜红的纹饰，上面还点缀着一些银色。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At that same moment the Maresciallo Roccofino ordered his men to continue climbing the slopes toward the flag on the edge of the cliff. There had been no answering fire for the last hour and he was sure the two outlaws had fled through their tunnel and were now going down the other side of the mountain toward the armored car. He wanted to close the trap. It took his men another hour to reach the cliff edge and tear down the flag. Maresciallo Roccofino went into the cave and had the boulders pushed aside to open up the tunnel. He sent his men down that stone corridor and down the other side of the mountain to rendezvous with the armored car. He was astounded when he found that his quarry had escaped him. He broke up his men into searching and scouting parties, sure they would flush the fugitives from their holes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时候，罗科菲诺上士正命令手下人继续沿山坡向插着那面旗帜的悬崖逼近。山上已经有一个小时没有开枪还击了，他想那两个土匪肯定已沿着秘密通道逃跑，而且现在正从大山的另一侧下山，朝那辆装甲车方向自投罗网去了。他想把网收起来。他的手下人又用了一个小时才到达那个悬崖的边沿，扯下那面旗帜。科洛菲诺上士走进那个洞穴，把那些大石头推向一边，打开那条秘密通道。他派手下人进入那条洞穴走廊，到山的另一侧与装甲车会合。当他发现猎物已经逃跑时，他大为震惊，立即把人分成搜索和警戒小组，相信他们会把逃犯从洞里赶出来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Pisciotta gave a little salute, serious yet mocking, buttoned his jacket over his pistol, and started walking toward the gates of the Bellampo Barracks. As he walked he glanced down the road that led to Castellammare, just to make sure there was no armored car on its way back from the mountains.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮肖塔做了个严肃但可笑的敬礼动作，随即把上衣扣子扣上，遮住那把手枪，然后朝着贝兰伯兵营的大门走去。他边走边留心通向海堡平原的那条路，看有没有装甲车从山里往回开。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The cart looked like a man with tattoos that covered every inch of his body. Between the shafts stood a sleepy white mule. Guiliano jumped into the empty driver's seat and looked into the cart. It was packed with huge jugs of wine cradled into bamboo baskets. There were at least twenty of them. Guiliano slipped his shotgun behind a row of jugs. He gave a quick look toward the mountains; there was nothing to be seen, except the flag still flying. He grinned down at Pisciotta. "Everything is in place," he said. "Go and do your little dance."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这辆大车就像一个从头到脚都文了身的人一样。两个车辕之间套着一头懒洋洋的白骡子。吉里安诺跳上驾驶座，朝车里看了看。车上装满了大竹篓坛装酒，少说也有二十坛。他把短筒猎枪塞到一排坛子后面，接着朝大山方向瞥了一眼，看见那面旗帜还在飘扬，但其他什么动静也没有。他笑着看了看阿斯帕努。“现在是万事俱备，”他说道，“去展示一下你的身手吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">High up on the cart seat, Turi Guiliano watched Pisciotta walk slowly across the open field and onto the stone path that led to the gate. Then he looked down the Via Bella. He could see his house, but there was nobody standing in front of it. He had hoped he might catch a glimpse of his mother. Some men were sitting in front of one of the houses, their table and wine bottles shaded by an overhanging balcony. Suddenly he remembered the binoculars around his neck and he undipped the strap and threw them into the back of the cart.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="坐在驭手座上的图里·吉里安诺看着皮肖塔，见他慢慢穿过开阔地，走上通向兵营大门那条石板路。接着他看了看贝拉大街。他能看见自己家的房子，但是房子前面没有站人。他原以为也许能看见母亲的。有一幢房子前面坐着几个人。他们的餐桌和酒瓶就放在阳台下面的阴凉处。他突然想起脖子上挂着的望远镜，赶紧松开皮带，把望远镜放进大车后面。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The guard only saw a scruffy peasant who dared to grow a mustache more elegant than he deserved. He said roughly, "You there, you lump, where do you think you're going?" He did not unsling his rifle. Pisciotta could have cut his throat in a second.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个卫兵眼里看见的是一个邋遢的农民，但却留着与身份不相称的漂亮小胡子。他没好气吆喝起来：“嘿，说你呢，你这家伙，知道这是什么地方吗？”他的步枪仍然在肩上挎着。如果这时候皮肖塔想割断他的脖子，简直易如反掌。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Instead he tried to look obsequious, tried to suppress his mirth at this child's arrogance. He said, "If you please, I wish to see the Maresciallo. I have some valuable information."</div>

<div class="line_en">A young carabiniere stood guard at the gate, a boy no more than eighteen. His rosy cheeks and hairless face proclaimed his birth in the northern provinces of Italy; his black uniform with white piping, baggy and untailored, and his braided, fiercely military cap gave him the look of some puppet or clown. Against regulations he had a cigarette in his adolescent, cupid's bow mouth. Approaching on foot, Pisciotta felt a surge of amused contempt. Even after what had happened in the last few days the man did not have his rifle ready.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在兵营大门口站岗的年轻宪兵顶多只有十八岁。一看他那红扑扑的面颊和光溜溜的脸，就知道他是意大利北方省份的人。那镶着白边的黑色警服穿在他身上显得松松垮垮，根本不合身。那顶有饰带的军帽戴在他头上，使他看上去活像个木偶或小丑。那张稚气未脱、弯弯的嘴上还叼了一支烟，这显然是违反规定的。皮肖塔慢慢朝他走去，内心不由得产生一股莫名其妙的鄙弃。尽管过去几天出了不少事，可是这家伙却没有把步枪端在手上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The guard looked at Pisciotta with a more friendly interest. It was true that many Sicilians became policemen. It was a road out of poverty, it was a small piece of power. It was a well-known national joke that Sicilians became either criminals or policemen and that they did equal damage on both sides. Meanwhile Pisciotta was laughing inwardly at the thought that he would ever become a carabiniere. Pisciotta was a dandy; he owned a silk shirt made in Palermo. Only a fool would preen in that white-piped black uniform and that ridiculous braided stiff billed cap.</div>

<div class="line_en">The guard looked bewildered. The insolence had him confused; the information offered made him realize he had better consult his superior. He had a feeling that this man was too slippery and could get him into trouble of some kind. He opened the gate and motioned Pisciotta with his rifle to enter the grounds of the Bellampo Barracks. His back was to the street. At that moment, Guiliano, a hundred yards away, kicked the mule awake and started his cart onto the stone pathway to the gate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卫兵显得很茫然。他被这家伙给弄糊涂了。从这个人要提供的情报来看，他觉得最好还是向他的上司报告一下。他有一种预感，觉得这人很狡猾，弄不好会使他倒大霉。他把大门打开，端着枪朝皮肖塔晃了晃，示意他进入贝兰伯兵营。他背对着街道。这时候，还在一百码开外的吉里安诺已把骡子踢醒，让它拉着车走上通向兵营大门的石板路。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The grounds of the Bellampo Barracks consisted of four acres. On the land was the large administration building with an L-shaped wing that held the jail cells. Behind it was the living barracks for the carabinieri themselves, large enough to hold a hundred men with a specially partitioned section that served as a private apartment for the Maresciallo. Off to the right side was a garage for vehicles that was really a barn and still served partially as such since the detachment supported a troop of mules and donkeys for mountain travel where mechanical vehicles were useless.</div>

<div class="line_en">Far in the rear were a munitions shed and a supply shed, both made of corrugated steel. Surrounding the whole area was a seven-foot barbed wire fence with two high towers for sentries, but these had not been used for many months. The barracks had been built by the Mussolini regime and then enlarged during the war on the Mafia.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在最后面是弹药仓库和军需仓库。两个仓库都是波纹钢结构。兵营的四周有一道七英尺高的铁丝网，外加两个岗楼，但是这些东西已经有好几个月不用了。这座兵营是墨索里尼时期建造的，对黑手党开战后进行了扩建。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Pisciotta went through the gate he checked for danger signals. The towers were empty, there were no roaming armed guards. It looked like some peaceful deserted farm. There were no vehicles in the garage; in fact there were no vehicles in sight anywhere, which surprised him, and made him worry that one would be returning soon. He could not conceive of the Maresciallo being so stupid as to leave his garrison without a vehicle. He would have to warn Turi that they might get unexpected visitors.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮肖塔走进大门时，先看看有没有危险迹象。岗楼上空无一人，院子里也没有武装游动哨。这个兵营里很平静，看起来像个被遗弃的农场。车库里没有车辆；实际上整个兵营里都看不见什么车辆。皮肖塔感到吃惊，也担心随时可能有车辆返回。他简直不敢相信上士居然这么傻，兵营里一辆车也不留。他真想告诫图里，他们可能随时遇到回营地的宪兵。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Shepherded by the young guard, Pisciotta entered the wide doors of the administration building. This was a huge room with ceiling fans which did little to dispel the heat. There was a large raised desk dominating the room, and on the sides were railings which enclosed smaller desks for clerks; around the room were wooden benches. These were all empty except for the raised desk. Seated at this was a carabinieri corporal who was an altogether different proposition from the young guard. An ornate gold nameplate on the desk read corporal Canio Silvestro. The upper part of his body was massive -- great shoulders and thick columnar neck crowned by a huge boulder of a head. A pink scar, a slab of shiny dead tissue, seemed pasted from his ear down to the end of his rocklike jaw. A long bushy handlebar mustache flew out like two black wings over his mouth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在年轻卫兵的押送下，皮肖塔走进办公楼宽阔的大门。这是个很大的房间，虽然天花板上的吊扇在转动，但却不足以驱散房间里的热气。在房间的显著位置有一张加长了腿的大办公桌，它的四周有一排栏杆，里面放着办事人员用的小办公桌。一些长条木凳靠四周摆放。房间里几乎没有人，只有那张大办公桌前面坐着一个下士。跟那个年轻卫兵相比，他显得全然不同。办公桌上金灿灿的姓名牌上写着“卡尼奥·西尔韦斯特罗下士”。他身材魁梧，膀大腰圆，脖子粗壮，脑袋硕大。从耳朵到那轮廓分明的下巴有一道粉红的伤疤，那是一块亮闪闪的失去机能的组织。他的嘴唇上方有两撇浓密的胡须，就像一对张开的黑色翅膀。">查看中文翻译</div>

When Corporal Silvestro spoke his accent revealed him to be a Sicilian. "You are a lying piece of shit," he said to Pisciotta. But before he could go any further, Guiliano's voice could be heard shouting inside the gate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="西尔韦斯特罗佩戴着下士袖标，腰里别着一把大手枪。糟糕的是，当卫兵报告了皮肖塔的来意之后，下士满腹狐疑，根本不相信。下士操着一口西西里方言对皮肖塔说：“你是个撒谎的混蛋。”可是他话音未落，就听见大门外传来吉里安诺的叫声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The painted cart and its white mule were outside the gate. Bare to the waist, his broad chest streaming with sweat, Turi Guiliano was swinging a jug of wine. There was a huge idiotic grin on his face; his whole body seemed oafishly askew. His appearance disarmed suspicion. There could be no weapon concealed on his person, he was drunk and the accent was that of the most loutish dialect in all of Sicily. The Corporal's hand dropped from his pistol, the guard lowered his rifle. Pisciotta took a step backward ready to draw his own gun from beneath his jacket.</div>

Pisciotta was directly behind the Corporal, the only soldier with his arms free. Guiliano scanned the slopes; there was no sign of any of the searching party returning. He checked the road to Castellammare; there was no sign of the armored car. Down the Via Bella the children were still playing. He reached into the wagon and pulled out the lupara and pointed it at the astonished Corporal. At the same time Pisciotta pulled the pistol from beneath his shirt. He pressed it against the Corporal's back. "Don't move an inch," Pisciotta said, "or I'll barber that great mustache of yours with lead."</div>

Guiliano permitted this but was always alert, his eyes on the captive carabinieri. His neighbors were in a delighted good humor at Guiliano's exploit; he had humiliated the hated police, he was their champion. They told him that the Maresciallo had ordered them to be bastinadoed but the Corporal had effectively stopped this punishment from being carried out by the sheer force of his character and his argument that such an action would create so much ill will that it would affect the safety of the barracks.

He was careful to speak to them as he had always spoken to them. "You are welcome to come with me to the mountains," he said. "Or you can go visit relatives in other parts of Sicily until the authorities come to their senses." He waited but there was only silence. The two bandits, Passatempo and Terranova, stood aside from the others. They were extremely alert, as if poised to spring. Passatempo was a short, squat ugly man with a gross face marked by childhood smallpox, his mouth thick and unshaped. The peasants in the countryside called him "The Brute." Terranova was small and built like a ferret. Yet his small features were pleasant, his lips molded into a natural smile. Passatempo had been the typical greedy Sicilian bandit who simply stole livestock and killed for money. Terranova had been a hard-working farmer and had started his career as an outlaw when two tax collectors came to confiscate his prize pig. He had killed both of them, slaughtered his pig for his family and relatives to eat and then fled to the mountains. The two men had joined forces but had been betrayed and captured when they were hiding in a deserted warehouse in the grain fields of Corleone.</div>

In the fraction of a second before the Corporal pulled the trigger, Guiliano felt an enormous serenity and no fear. His eyes did not blink when the Corporal pulled the trigger, indeed he took a step forward. There was a loud metallic click as the hammer hit the defective ammunition in the barrel. A fraction of a second afterward, he was swarmed over by Pisciotta, Terranova and Passatempo, and the Corporal was falling under the weight of bodies. Terranova had grasped the pistol and was twisting it away, Passatempo had the Corporal by the hair of his head and was trying to gouge out his eyes, Pisciotta had his knife out and ready to plunge it into the Corporal's throat.

This was the man who had put him to the test, and who had confirmed his own immortality; this was the man who had certified the impotence of death. Guiliano pulled him to his feet and to the astonishment of all the others gave him a quick embrace. Then he pretended that he was merely helping the Corporal to stand erect.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Montelepre citizens who had been prisoners left hastily. They did not want to be witnesses to a massacre of carabinieri. Guiliano shepherded the Corporal and his fellow guards to the prison wing and locked them in the communal cell together. Then he led Pisciotta, Terranova and Passatempo on a search through the other buildings of the Bellampo Barracks. In the weapons shed they found rifles, pistols and machine pistols, with boxes of ammunition. They draped the weapons over their bodies and loaded the boxes of ammunition into the cart. From the living quarters they took some blankets and sleeping bags and Pisciotta threw two carabinieri uniforms into the cart just for good luck. Then, with Guiliano in the driver's seat, the can brimming over the top with looted goods, the other three men, walking with weapons ready, spread out to protect against any attack. They moved quickly down the road toward Castellammare. It took them over an hour to make their way to the house of the farmer who had loaned Hector Adonis the cart and to bury their loot in his pigpen. Then they helped the farmer cover his can with olive green paint stolen from an American Army supply depot.</div>

<div class="line_en">Newspapers all over Italy gave the story great prominence. Just three days before, the killing of the two other carabinieri had also been front-page news, but then Guiliano had just been another desperate Sicilian bandit whose only claim to fame was ferocity. This exploit was another matter. He had won a battle of wits and tactics against the National Police. He had freed his friends and neighbors from what was obviously an unjust imprisonment. Journalists from Palermo, Naples, Rome and Milan descended on the town of Montelepre, interviewing Turi Guiliano's family and friends. His mother was photographed holding up Turi's guitar which she claimed he played like an angel. (This was not true; he was only beginning to play well enough to make his tune recognizable.) His former schoolmates confessed that Turi was such a great reader of books that he had been nicknamed "The Professor." The newspapers seized upon this with delight. A Sicilian bandit who could actually read. They mentioned his cousin Aspanu Pisciotta, who had joined him in his outlawry out of sheer friendship, and wondered at a man who could inspire such loyalty.</div>

<div class="line_en">That an old photograph taken of him when he was seventeen showed him to be incredibly handsome in a Mediterranean manly fashion made the whole story irresistible. But perhaps what appealed to the Italian people most of all was Guiliano's act of mercy in sparing the Corporal who had tried to kill him. It was better than opera -- it was more like the puppet shows so popular in Sicily, where the wooden figures never lost blood or had their flesh torn and mangled by bullets.</div>
