<div class="line_en">Becky Sharp left London and travelled down to Queen's Crawley in hampshire, the home of Sir Pitt Crawley. Sir Pitt was a baronet and a Member of Parliament, and the land-owning Crawley family was of a higher social class than the Sedleys and the Osbornes, who had made their money by commerce. This thought comforted Becky as she reflected on her failed adventure with Mr Joseph Sedley.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sir Pitt Crawley is nothing like we silly girls imagined a baronet to be. Think of a short old man, in dirty old clothes, who smokes a horrible pipe, speaks with a rough uneducated accent, swears at his servants, and gets drunk every night! He has been married twice, I learn, and has two sons by his first wife. The older, Mr Pitt Crawley, still lives here. He's a pale, thin, ugly man, who is always reading religious books and riding around the countryside, telling everybody to lead good lives.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮特·克劳利爵士跟我们这些傻姑娘想象中的准男爵的样子一点都不像。想象一下，一个矮老头子，衣衫肮脏破旧，抽糟糕的烟斗，说一口粗野土话，冲着仆人咒骂，还每天晚上都喝醉！我听说，他结了两次婚，和第一任妻子生了两个儿子。长子皮特·克劳利先生，现在仍住在这里。他苍白瘦弱，长相难看，总是读宗教书籍，还骑着马在乡下到处转悠，劝诫人们要规规矩矩地生活。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sir Pitt also has a brother, Mr Bute Crawley. He and his wife, whom everyone calls Mrs Bute (there are so many Crawleys!), live in a house nearby. It seems that he and Sir Pitt don't get on -- some quarrel about money, I believe. Indeed, Sir Pitt himself is very mean -- I am not allowed to have a candle in my room after eleven at night! But of course I cannot complain, as I am only a poor little governess!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮特爵士还有个弟弟——比特·克劳利先生。他和他的妻子——大家叫她比特夫人（这里叫克劳利的实在太多了！）——住在附近的一栋宅子里。他和皮特爵士似乎关系不和——是因为钱发生争执，我认为。千真万确，皮特爵士本人吝啬极了——晚上十一点过后我的房间里都不准点蜡烛！可是当然啦，我是不能抱怨的，我只不过是个可怜的小家庭教师罢了！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As for Lady Crawley, Sir Pitt's second wife, she is a poor, faded, unhappy creature, who has nothing to say. She is quite often ill, and spends the rest of her time sewing.

<div class="line_en">Becky may have been a poor governess, but she was a clever, cunning little creature as well. For we must remember that this story has Vanity Fair for a title, and Vanity Fair is a very vain, wicked, foolish place, full of all sorts of falseness and pretence.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was certainly true that Sir Pitt Crawley was a mean, selfish, rude old man. He was never known to give away a penny, or to do a good action, but he enjoyed a joke -- and the company of a lively and amusing young woman. So the little governess had no difficulty in making herself useful and agreeable to her employer. She wrote his letters for him, played cards with him, and helped with the management of the farm, park and gardens.</div>

<div class="line_en">PLEASE FORGIVE MY LONG SILENCE, dearest Amelia, but for some weeks now our usual quiet life at Queen's Crawley has been quite different, because Miss Matilda Crawley is here on her yearly visit. We have dinner-parties and dancing-parties; we drink the best wines every day, and there are fires in every room. Miss Crawley, you see, is Sir Pitt's unmarried half-sister. She is a fat old lady, but has a fortune of seventy thousand pounds, which makes her brothers, Sir Pitt and Mr Bute, very affectionate towards her, as you might imagine! It is said that she intends to divide her fortune between Mr Bute's family, and Sir Pitt's younger son, Rawdon Crawley, who is a captain in the army and a great favourite with his aunt. This Captain Rawdon is staying here now, and I suppose you will like to know what sort of person he is.</div>

<div class="line_en">Your affectionate friend, Rebecca Becky did not, strange to say, give her dear friend an altogether accurate report of Captain Rawdon Crawley. The Captain had paid her not just one, but a great many compliments. The Captain had walked with her twenty times in the park, had met her in fifty corridors and passages. The Captain had leaned over her piano in the evenings as she sang, while Miss Matilda Crawley nodded sleepily in her chair by the fire. (Lady Crawley was now upstairs, being ill, and ignored by everyone in the house.)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="深爱你的朋友，丽贝卡，说来奇怪，贝姬并没有向她的朋友完全准确地描述罗顿·克劳利上尉。上尉可不仅仅只说过一句恭维话，而是恭维过她许多次。上尉陪她在庭园里散过二十次步，在过道和走廊见过她五十回。晚上她边弹琴边唱歌时，上尉会斜倚在她的钢琴旁，而玛蒂尔达·克劳利小姐则坐在炉边的椅子上打瞌睡。（克劳利女士因为病了，待在楼上，被屋子里的所有人遗忘了。）">查看中文翻译</div>

He has a loud voice, swears a great deal, and is always giving orders to the servants, who all love him in spite of this, for he is very generous with his money -- when he has any! He leads quite a wild life, I believe, gambling and so on, but his aunt Miss Matilda just laughs, and often pays his debts for him. She says he is worth far more than his boring brother, Mr Pitt Crawley, whom she hates.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="嗯，他是个魁梧、时髦的年轻人。他大嗓门，老是说粗话，总对仆人们发号施令。尽管如此，仆人们都很喜欢他，因为他花钱非常大方——只要手头有一点钱就这样！我猜想，他生活放荡不羁，爱赌博啊什么的，但他的姑姑玛蒂尔达小姐对此只是哈哈一笑，还经常为他还债。她说，他可比他那无聊的哥哥强多了。她讨厌皮特·克劳利先生。">查看中文翻译</div>

One night at a dancing-party he asked me, the poor little governess, to dance with him, and afterwards he swore out loud that I was the neatest little dancer in the room.

<div class="line_en">Nor did Becky mention to her friend what a great liking Miss Crawley had taken to her. Nothing would satisfy the old lady but that Miss Sharp should always sit next to her at dinner, and entertain her with amusing conversation.</div>

<div class="line_en">Not long after this, a carriage stopped at Miss Matilda Crawley's home in London in Park Lane, a fine comfortable house, and Miss Crawley herself was carried inside. Doctors were called, and the old lady was put to bed and cared for day and night by a young person who had accompanied her from Queen's Crawley.

<div class="line_en">Captain Rawdon Crawley visited every day, and spent a good deal of time in the company of Miss Sharp, receiving reports about his aunt's health.
