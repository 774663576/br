<div class="line_en">Halfway through October came their first trip of the term to Hogsmeade. Harry had wondered whether these trips would still be allowed, given the increasingly tight security measures around the school, but was pleased to know that they were going ahead; it was always good to get out of the castle grounds for a few hours.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="邓布利多去了哪儿？他在做什么？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry caught sight of the headmaster only twice over the next few weeks. He rarely appeared at meals anymore, and Harry was sure Hermione was right in thinking that he was leaving the school for days at a time. Had Dumbledore forgotten the lessons he was supposed to be giving Harry? Dumbledore had said that the lessons were leading to something to do with the prophecy; Harry had felt bolstered, comforted, and now he felt slightly abandoned.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在接下来的几个星期里，哈利只见过校长两次。他很少在吃饭的时候露面，看来赫敏认为校长一次离开好几天的说法是对的。难道邓布利多忘记了他应该给哈利单独上课吗？邓布利多说过，那些课最终跟那个预言有关。哈利曾经觉得很受鼓舞，心里很踏实，现在却有点儿被遗弃的感觉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry woke early on the morning of the trip, which was proving stormy, and whiled away the time until breakfast by reading his copy of Advanced Potion-Making. He did not usually lie in bed reading his textbooks; that sort of behavior, as Ron rightly said, was indecent in anybody except Hermione, who was simply weird that way. Harry felt, however, that the Half-Blood Princes copy of Advanced Potion-Making hardly qualified as a textbook. The more Harry pored over the book, the more he realized how much was in there, not only the handy hints and shortcuts on potions that was earning him such a glowing reputation with Slughorn, but also the imaginative little jinxes and hexes scribbled in the margins, which Harry was sure, judging by the crossings-out and revisions, that the Prince had invented himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="去霍格莫德村的那天早晨，外面刮起了狂风，哈利醒得很早，他翻看着那本《高级魔药制作》消磨早饭前的时间。平常他是不躺在床上看课本的，罗恩说得对，除了赫敏，这种行为放在任何人身上都是不雅观的，而赫敏那么做只是显得有些怪异而已。不过哈利觉得，混血王子的那本《高级魔药制作》根本不能算作课本。哈利越仔细研读那本书，越觉得里面内容丰富，不仅有容易操作的提示和快捷方法——正是这些让哈利赢得了斯拉格霍恩的热烈称赞，而且书的空白处还胡乱记着许多很有创意的小恶咒和小魔法，从那些涂涂改改的笔迹上看，哈利断定这些东西都是王子自己发明的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry had already attempted a few of the Prince's self-invented spells. There had been a hex that caused toenails to grow alarmingly fast (he had tried this on Crabbe in the corridor, with very entertaining results); a jinx that glued the tongue to the roof of the mouth (which he had twice used, to general applause, on an unsuspecting Argus Filch); and, perhaps most useful of all, Muffliato, a spell that filled the ears of anyone nearby with an unidentifiable buzzing, so that lengthy conversations could be held in class with out being overheard. The only person who did not find these charms amusing was Hermione, who maintained a rigidly disapproving expression throughout and refused to talk at all if Harry had used the Muffliato spell on anyone in the vicinity.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利已经尝试过王子发明的几个咒语。有一个恶咒是让人的脚趾噌噌地疯长（他在走廊上拿克拉布做了一个试验，效果有趣极了）；还有一个咒语是把人的舌头粘在上腭上（他在阿格斯·费尔奇身上用了两次，赢得了大家的热烈喝彩，而费尔奇还蒙在鼓里，毫无察觉）；最有用的要数闭耳塞听咒了，这个咒语能让周围每个人的耳朵里充满一种无法辨别的嗡嗡声，这样，在课堂上就能随心所欲地聊天，不怕被别人听见了。惟一觉得这些魔法不好玩的就是赫敏，她始终板着脸，一副不以为然的样子，如果哈利对近旁的什么人施了闭耳塞听咒，她就干脆一句话也不说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sitting up in bed, Harry turned the book sideways so as to examine more closely the scribbled instructions for a spell that seemed to have caused the Prince some trouble. There were many crossings-out and alterations, but finally, crammed into a corner of the page, the scribble:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利坐在床上，把课本侧过来仔细研读那潦草的笔迹写出的一个咒语，王子似乎在这个咒语上费了不少脑筋。经过无数次的涂涂改改，最后在那一页的角落上挤挤挨挨地写着这么几个字：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">While the wind and sleet pounded relentlessly on the windows, and Neville snored loudly, Harry stared at the letters in brackets. Nvbl… that had to mean "nonverbal." Harry rather doubted he would be able to bring off this particular spell; he was still having difficulty with nonverbal spells, something Snape had been quick to comment on in every D. A. D. A. class. On the other hand, the Prince had proved a much more effective teacher than Snape so far.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="狂风裹着雨夹雪，无情地打在窗户上，纳威很响地打着呼噜，哈利盯着括号里的那两个字。无声……肯定是指无声咒。哈利不知道自己能不能练成功这个特殊的咒语。他对于无声咒仍然不能得心应手，斯内普在黑魔法防御术课上动不动拿这件事说三道四。其实，王子教给哈利的东西比斯内普要多得多。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">By the time they had got dressed, padding themselves out with several of Mrs. Weasleys hand-knitted sweaters and carrying cloaks, scarves, and gloves, Ron's shock had subsided and he had decided that Harry's new spell was highly amusing; so amusing, in fact, that he lost no time in regaling Hermione with the story as they sat down for breakfast.</div>

Now, however, a wonderful possibility occurred to him. Could the Half-Blood Prince possibly be --?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后这句不是实话。实际上，哈利是亲眼看见他父亲给斯内普施了这个魔法，但他一直没有把他在冥想盆里的那段经历告诉罗恩和赫敏。不过，眼下他突然想起一种很奇妙的可能性。混血王子会不会就是——？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Maybe your dad did use it, Harry," said Hermione, "but he's not the only one. We've seen a whole bunch of people use it, in case you've forgotten. Dangling people in the air. Making them float along, asleep, helpless."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“或许你爸爸使用过它，哈利，”赫敏说，“但使用过它的不止你爸爸一个人。我们看见过一大堆人都在使用它，也许你已经忘记了。把人悬在半空，让他们昏昏沉沉、无能为力地在上面飘浮。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That was different," he said robustly. "They were abusing it. Harry and his dad were just having a laugh. You don't like the Prince, Hermione," he added, pointing a sausage at her sternly, "because he's better than you at Potions --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那是两码事。”他大大咧咧地说，“他们是在滥用这个魔法。哈利和他爸爸只是闹着玩儿。赫敏，你不喜欢王子，”他严肃地用香肠指着赫敏说道，“是因为他的魔药课学得比你好——”">查看中文翻译</div>

The road to the village was full of students bent double against the bitter wind. More than once Harry wondered whether they might not have had a better time in the warm common room, and when they finally reached Hogsmeade and saw that Zonko's Joke Shop had been boarded up, Harry took it as confirmation that this trip was not destined to be fun.

Harry's thoughts strayed to Ginny as they trudged up the road to Hogwarts through the frozen slush.
