<div class="line_en">Over the previous months Guiliano had lived up to his agreement with Rome. He had torn down all the posters of rival parties, had raided the headquarters of left-wing groups and broken up their meetings in Corleone, Montelepre, Castellammare, Partinico, Piani dei Greci, San Giuseppe Jato and the great city of Monreale. His bandits had put posters in all these cities that proclaimed in great black letters, death to the communists, and he had burned some of the community houses established by the Socialist Workers groups. But his campaign had started too late to affect the regional elections, and he had been reluctant to use the ultimate terror of assassination. Messages flew between Don Croce, Minister Trezza, the Cardinal of Palermo and Turi Guiliano. Reproaches were made. Guiliano was urged to step up his campaign so that the situation could be reversed for the national elections. Guiliano saved all these messages for his Testament.</div>

<div class="line_en">The 1948 April elections of the Sicilian legislature were a disaster for the Christian Democratic party in Rome. The "People's Bloc," the combination of Communist Socialist left-wing parties, polled 600,000 votes, to the Christian Democratic 330,000. Another 500.000 votes were split between the Monarchist and two other splinter parties. Panic reigned in Rome. Something drastic had to be done before the national election or Sicily, the most backward region of the country, would be decisive in turning all of Italy into a Socialist country.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="1948年4月，西西里立法机构的选举对罗马的基督教民主党无异于一场大灾难。由共产党和社会党所组成的左翼政党“人民联盟”获得六十万张选票，而基督教民主党才获得三十三万张选票。其余五十万张选票由保皇党和另外两个小政党所拥有。罗马陷入一片恐慌。在大选之前必须采取极端手段，否则，西西里这个最落后的地区就会在意大利走向社会主义的进程中起到决定性的作用。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The two most left-wing and generally rebellious towns in Sicily were Piani dei Greci and San Giuseppe Jato. For many years, even under Mussolini, they had celebrated the first of May as the day of revolution. Since May first was also the name day of Saint Rosalia, their celebration would be disguised as a religious festival not forbidden by the Fascist authorities. But now their May Day parades were bold with red flags and inflammatory speeches. The coming May Day in a week's time was to be the greatest in history. As was the custom, the two towns would combine to celebrate and envoys from all over Sicily would bring their families to rejoice over their recent victory. The Communist Senator, Lo Causi, a renowned and fiery orator, would give the main speech. It was to be the official celebration of the Left of their recent stunning victory in the elections.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="西西里岛最左倾叛逆的两个镇是皮亚尼—德格雷西和圣朱塞佩—亚托。多年来，即使在墨索里尼统治时期，他们也把五一节作为革命节日来庆祝。由于5月1日也是圣罗沙利节，他们可以利用宗教庆典作为掩护来搞庆祝，因为法西斯不禁止宗教活动。可是现在，他们在五一节游行活动中公开打出红旗，进行煽动性演说。一个星期之后的五一节活动将是有史以来规模最大的。按照以往的惯例，这两个镇将联合进行庆祝活动，来自西西里各地的代表会带着家人前来庆祝他们最近的胜利。共产党参议员、著名的激情演说家洛考西将发表重要讲演。这是左派为他们在近期选举中取得的胜利而举行的一次正式的庆祝。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Don Croce's plan was that this celebration was to be attacked by Guiliano's band and broken up. They would mount machine guns and fire over the heads of the crowd to disperse them. It was to be the first step in a campaign of intimidation, a paternal warning, a soft advisory hand of admonishment. The Communist Senator, Lo Causi, would learn that his election to Parliament did not give him license in Sicily or make sacred his person. Guiliano agreed to the plan and ordered his chiefs, Pisciotta, Terranova, Passatempo, Silvestro and Stefano Andolini to stand by to carry it out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="唐·克罗切的计划是让吉里安诺袭击并且阻止这场活动。他们要用机关枪朝人群头顶上方开枪，目的是把他们驱散。这是恫吓行动的第一步，是一次家长式的警告，是一种温柔的告诫。共产党参议员洛考西得要明白，当选国会议员并不代表西西里欢迎他，也不代表他能成为圣人。吉里安诺同意这项计划，下令他的头领皮肖塔、泰拉诺瓦、帕萨藤珀、西尔韦斯特罗和斯特凡·安多里尼做好动手的准备。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For the last three years the celebration had always been held on a mountain plain between Piani dei Greci and San Giuseppe Jato, sheltered by the twin peaks of Monte Pizzuta and Monte Cumeta. The people of the towns would climb up to the plain on wildly curving roads that joined near the top, so that the populations of the two towns would meet and become a single procession. They would enter the plain through a narrow pass, and then spread out to celebrate their holiday. This pass was called the Portella della Ginestra.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在过去三年中，庆祝活动都在皮亚尼—德格雷西和圣朱塞佩—亚托之间、以皮祖塔山峰和库梅塔山峰为屏障的一块平地上举行。有两条崎岖的山路在接近山顶处会合。两个镇的人沿山路朝那块台地行进，在此处汇成一股，穿过一个狭窄的通道进入那片平地，然后分散开来搞他们的庆祝活动。这个狭窄的通道叫吉里斯特拉山口。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The villages of Piani dei Greci and San Giuseppe Jato were poor, their houses ancient, their agriculture archaic.

<div class="line_en">The villages were so old that most of the houses were built of stone, and some had no windows but only small apertures covered with iron discs. Many families housed their animals in the rooms in which they lived. The town bakeries kept goats and young lambs huddled by their ovens, and if a freshly baked loaf dropped to the floor it would usually hit a pile of dung.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Cardinal of Palermo also was vexed. He had made a special trip to say a Mass in the two villages and had warned them not to vote for the Communists. He had blessed their children and even baptized them, and still they had turned on their Church. He summoned the village priests to Palermo and warned them that they must increase their efforts for the national elections. Not only in the political interests of the Church but to save ignorant souls from hell.</div>

<div class="line_en">But in the regional election of April 1948 they had treacherously voted overwhelmingly for the Communist or Socialist parties. This had enraged Don Croce who thought that the local Mafia chief controlled the area. But the Don declared that it was the disrespect to the Catholic Church that saddened him. How could devout Sicilians have so deceived the holy sisters who with Christian charity put bread into the mouths of their children?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是在1948年4月的地区性选举中，他们却背弃诺言，以一边倒的态势把选票投给了共产党和社会党。唐·克罗切原以为那些地区都在当地黑手党首领的控制之下，出现这种情况使他极为恼火。他公开地说，那里的人对基督教会的不尊重使他感到难过。那些虔诚的西西里人怎么能欺骗那些从事基督教慈善事业、把面包放进他们孩子嘴里的修女呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The village men hired themselves out as laborers to wealthy landowners for a dollar a day and sometimes even less, not enough to feed their families.

<div class="line_en">Minister Trezza was not so surprised. He was Sicilian and knew the island's history. The people of the two villages had always been proud and ferocious fighters against the rich in Sicily and the tyranny of Rome. They had been the first to join Garibaldi, and before that they had fought the French and Moorish rulers of the island. In Piani dei Greci the villagers descended from Greeks who had fled to Sicily to escape Turkish invaders. These villagers still retained their Greek customs, spoke the language and observed the Greek holidays by wearing ancient costumes. But it had been a stronghold of the Mafia which had always fostered rebellion. So Minister Trezza was disappointed by Don Croce's performance, his inability to educate them. But he also knew that the vote in the villages and the whole surrounding countryside had been engineered by one man, a Socialist party organizer named Silvio Ferra.</div>

<div class="line_en">Silvio Ferra was a highly decorated soldier in the Italian Army of World War II. He had won his medals in the African campaign and then had been captured by the American Army. He had been an inmate of a prisoner of war camp in the United States where he had attended educational courses designed to make prisoners understand the democratic process. He had not quite believed them until he had been given permission to work outside the camp for a baker in the local town. He had been amazed at the freedom of American life, the ease with which hard work could be turned into a lasting prosperity, the upward mobility of the lower classes. In Sicily the hardest-working peasant could only hope to provide food and shelter for his children; there could be no provision for the future.</div>

<div class="line_en">In four years he had done what the agitators from the north of Italy could not do. He had translated the Red Revolution and Socialist doctrine into Sicilian terms. He convinced them that a vote for the Socialist party meant getting a piece of land. He preached that the great estates of the nobles should be broken up since the nobles left them uncultivated. Land that could grow wheat for their children. He convinced them that under a Socialist government the corruption of Sicilian society could be wiped out. There would be no bribing of officials for preference, no one would have to give a priest a pair of eggs to read a letter from America, the village postman would not have to be given a token lira to ensure delivery of mail, men would not have to auction off the labor of their bodies at a pittance to work the fields of dukes and barons. There would be an end to starvation wages, and the officials of the government would be servants of the people, as it was in America. Silvio Ferra quoted chapter and verse to show that the official Catholic Church propped up the debased capitalistic system, yet he never attacked the Virgin Mary, the diversified useful saints, or a belief in Jesus. On Easter mornings he greeted his neighbors with the traditional, "Christ is risen." On Sundays he went to Mass. His wife and children were strictly supervised in true Sicilian style for he was a believer in all the old values, the son's absolute devotion for his mother, respect for his father, the sense of obligation for his most obscure cousins.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在四年的时间里，他做了意大利北方的煽动者做不到的事。他把红色革命和社会主义翻译成了西西里方言。他使人们深信选举社会党就意味着得到一块土地。他鼓吹说应当瓜分贵族的大庄园，因为贵族并不耕种这些土地。这些土地可以长出小麦喂饱他们的孩子。他劝说他们相信，社会党政府能够消灭西西里社会的腐败现象。不需要为了特殊关照而贿赂官员，不需要给神父送两个鸡蛋来让他帮忙读一封来自美国的信，也不必给镇上的邮差一个里拉确保信能送到。男人们不必再为了一点微薄的工钱廉价出卖自己的劳动力，到公爵和伯爵的土地上干活。不会再有连肚子都填不饱的工资，政府官员将成为人民的公仆，就像在美国一样。西尔韦奥·费拉引经据典来表明官方的天主教提出的是低劣的资本主义，但是他从来没有攻击过圣母玛利亚和值得赞颂的各位圣徒，也没有攻击过对耶稣的信仰。复活节的早晨，在跟邻居打招呼的时候，他使用的是传统的“基督复活了”。星期天早晨他都要去参加弥撒。他对妻子和孩子都是严格按照西西里的方式进行管教，因为他相信所有老的价值观念，认为儿子要绝对孝顺自己的母亲，敬重自己的父亲，并有责任关照最远房的平辈亲戚。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When he was returned to his native Sicily, Silvio Ferra became an ardent advocate of America. But he soon saw that the Christian Democratic party was a tool of the rich and so joined a Socialist Workers' study group in Palermo. He had a thirst for education and a passion for books. Soon he had gobbled up all the theories of Marx and Engels and then joined the Socialist party. He was given the assignment of organizing the party club in San Giuseppe Jato.</div>

When Don Croce sent special messengers to try to make an accommodation, he put them off.

<div class="line_en">But most of all Silvio Ferra had a sympathy for his fellow man, a rare quality in the Sicilian peasant. If a neighbor became ill he brought food for his family, he did chores for ailing old widows who lived alone, he cheered all those men who eked out a bare living and were fearful of their futures. He proclaimed a new dawn of hope under the Socialist party. When he gave political speeches he used the southern rhetoric so dearly loved by Sicilians. He did not explain the economic theories of Marx but spoke with fire of the vengeance owed to those who had oppressed the peasants for centuries. "As bread is sweet to us," he said, "so is the blood of the poor to the rich who drink it."</div>

Silvio Ferra had been born in Montelepre. Even as a youth his qualities had been evident. Turi Guiliano had admired him extravagantly, though they had not been close friends because of the difference in their ages -- Guiliano was four years younger -- and because Silvio had gone off to war. Silvio had returned a much decorated hero. He met a girl from San Giuseppe Jato and moved there to marry her. And as the political fame of Ferra grew, Guiliano let it be known the man was his friend though their politics were different.

<div class="line_en">On May Day of 1948 the populace of the two towns of Piani dei Greci and San Giuseppe Jato rose early to start on their long march up mountain trails to the plain beyond the Portella della Ginestra. They were led by bands of musicians from Palermo especially hired for the occasion. Silvio Ferra, flanked by his wife and two children, was in the vanguard of the San Giuseppe Jato procession, proudly carrying one of the huge red flags. Dazzlingly painted carts, with their horses in special red plumes and colorful tasseled blankets, were loaded with cooking pots, huge wooden boxes of spaghetti, enormous wooden bowls for salads. There was a special cart for the jugs of wine. Another cart fitted with blocks of ice carried wheels of cheese, great salami logs and the dough and ovens to bake fresh bread.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="1948年五一节那天，皮亚尼—德格雷西和圣朱塞佩—亚托两个小镇的居民一大早就起来，沿着山间小路朝吉里斯特拉山口那边的台地进行长距离攀登。走在队伍前面的是几支乐队，是为举行这次活动特地从巴勒莫雇请的。圣朱塞佩—亚托的人自豪地手持红旗，西尔韦奥·费拉在妻子和两个孩子的簇拥下走在这支队伍的最前面。油漆得五彩缤纷的大车装载着做饭的锅、装着面条的大木箱、盛色拉用的大木碗，拉车的马身上插着特别的红色羽毛，披着五颜六色的毛毯。还有一辆大车专门装了一坛坛的酒。另一辆车上装着大冰块，上面放着圆饼状的奶酪、大段大段的萨拉米香肠、揉好的生面团以及烤面包用的烤炉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And so when Guiliano agreed to suppress the festival at the Portella della Ginestra, he sent a friendly warning to Silvio Ferra that he should not take part in the May Day meeting. He assured him that none of the villagers of San Giuseppe Jato would be harmed but that there might be some danger he could not protect him from if he persisted in his Socialist party activities. Not that he, Guiliano, would ever do anything to harm him, but the Friends of the Friends were determined to crush the Socialist party in Sicily and Ferra would certainly be one of their targets.</div>

<div class="line_en">As Silvio Ferra led his townspeople toward the narrow mountain pass called the Portella della Ginestra, the people of Piani dei Greci converged from the other road, holding their red flags and Socialist party standards high. The two crowds mixed, exchanging exuberant greetings as they walked on, gossiping about the latest scandals in their villages and speculating on what their victory in the election would bring, what dangers lay ahead. Despite rumors that there would be trouble on this May Day they were by no means afraid. Rome they despised, the Mafia they feared, but not to submission.

<div class="line_en">On that same morning but much earlier, indeed before the smokey Sicilian sun had risen, two squads of twelve men each had made the march from Guiliano's headquarters in the mountains above Montelepre down to the mountain range which held the Portella della Ginestra. One squad was commanded by Passatempo and the other by Terranova. Each squad carried a heavy machine gun. Passatempo led his men high up on the slopes of Monte Cumeta and carefully supervised the emplacement of his machine gun. Four men were detailed to service and fire it.

<div class="line_en">Guiliano had planned to go with this expedition and command it personally, but seven days before May Day, Aspanu Pisciotta's weak chest had finally succumbed to a hemorrhage. He had been running up the side of the mountain to the band's headquarters when blood spurted out of his mouth and he collapsed to the ground. His body started rolling downhill. Guiliano, climbing behind him, thought it was one of his cousin's pranks. He stopped the body with his foot and then saw the front of Pisciotta's shirt covered with blood. At first he thought Aspanu had been hit by a sniper and he had missed the sound of the shot. He took Pisciotta in his arms and carried him uphill. Pisciotta was still conscious and kept murmuring, "Put me down, put me down." And Guiliano knew it could not be a bullet. The voice betrayed the weariness of an inner breakage, not the savage trauma of a body violated by metal.</div>

<div class="line_en">When Silvio Ferra turned to the sound of the firecrackers, three things registered simultaneously on his mind. The first was the sight of a small boy holding up his arm in astonishment. At the end of it, instead of a hand holding a kite, was a bloody horrible stump, the kite sailing off to the sky above the slopes of Monte Cumeta. The second was his shock of recognition -- the firecrackers were machine-gun fire. The third was a great black horse plunging wildly through the crowd, riderless, its flanks streaming blood. Then Silvio Ferra was running through the crowd, searching for his wife and children.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="西尔韦奥·费拉听见鞭炮声后转身时，大脑中同时记录了三件事。第一，他看见一个惊恐万状的小男孩举着手臂。那手臂的末端不是一只抓着风筝线的手，而是一只可怕的、血淋淋的残手，那断线的风筝正飘向库梅塔山的山坡。第二，他辨别出那不是鞭炮声，而是机枪的扫射声，顿时大惊失色。第三，一匹没有骑手的高大黑马在人群中横冲直撞，它的侧面血流如注。这时费拉飞快地冲进人群，去寻找自己的妻子和孩子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On the slopes of Monte Pizzuta, Terranova watched the scene through his field glasses. At first he thought people were falling to the ground out of terror, and then he saw motionless bodies sprawled with that peculiar abandon of death and he struck the machine gunner away from his weapon. But as his machine gun fell silent, he could still hear the gun on Monte Cumeta chattering. Terranova thought Passatempo had not yet seen that the gunfire had been aimed too low and people were being massacred. After a few minutes the other gun stopped and an awful stillness filled the Portella della Ginestra. Then floating up to the twin mountain peaks came the wails of the living, the shrieks of the wounded and the dying. Terranova signaled his men to gather close, had them dismantle the machine gun, and then led them away around the other side of the mountain to make their escape. As they did so he was pondering whether he should return to Guiliano to report this tragedy. He was afraid Guiliano might execute him and his men out of hand. Yet he was sure Guiliano would give him a fair hearing, and he and his men could truly swear that they had elevated their fire. He would return to headquarters and report. He wondered if Passatempo would do the same.</div>

<div class="line_en">After he dismissed them, Guiliano sat alone. He felt, for the first time since he had become a bandit, a sense of intolerable shame. In more than four years as an outlaw he could boast that he had never harmed the poor. That boast was no longer true. He had massacred them. In his innermost heart he could no longer think of himself as a hero. Then he thought over the possibilities. It could have been a mistake: His band was fine with lupare, but the heavy machine guns were not too familiar to them. Firing downward, it was possible they had misjudged the angle. He could not believe that Terranova or Passatempo had played him false, but there was always the awful possibility that one or both had been bribed to commit the massacre. Also, it had occurred to him the moment he heard the news that there might have been a third ambush party.</div>
