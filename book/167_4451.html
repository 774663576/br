<div class="line_en">He was old enough to know that it was not truly him they shouted for -- it was the harvest they cheered, it was Robb and his victories, it was his lord father and his grandfather and all the Starks going back eight thousand years. Still, it made him swell with pride. For so long as it took him to ride the length of that hall he forgot that he was broken. Yet when he reached the dais, with every eye upon him, Osha and Hodor undid his straps and buckles, lifted him off Dancer's back, and carried him to the high seat of his fathers.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dancer was draped in bardings of snowy white wool emblazoned with the grey direwolf of House Stark, while Bran wore grey breeches and white doublet, his sleeves and collar trimmed with vair. Over his heart was his wolf's-head brooch of silver and polished jet. He would sooner have had Summer than a silver wolf on his breast, but Ser Rodrik had been unyielding.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小舞披着一身雪白的羊毛衣，衣上绣着史塔克家族的灰色冰原狼纹章；布兰穿着灰马裤，白上装，袖子和领口镶了松鼠皮。他的胸前别着白银和铮亮黑玉制成的狼头胸针。其实他本想带上活生生的夏天，而非戴只银狼，可惜罗德利克爵士不准。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The low stone steps balked Dancer only for a moment. When Bran urged her on, she took them easily. Beyond the wide oak-and-iron doors, eight long rows of trestle tables filled Winterfell's Great Hall, four on each side of the center aisle. Men crowded shoulder to shoulder on the benches. "Stark!" they called as Bran trotted past, rising to their feet. "Winterfell! Winterfell!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="起初，低矮的石阶让小舞踌躇不前，然而布兰一加催促，它立刻轻松地越了过去。在橡木和钢铁制成的大门内，八列长桌占满了临冬城的大厅，一边四列，中间空出走道。人们接踵磨肩地挤在长凳上。“史塔克万岁！”布兰疾跑而过，人们纷纷起立，高声呼喊，“临冬城万岁！临冬城万岁！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You don't, so hush up," he told his brother. Ser Rodrik bellowed for quiet. Bran raised his voice. He bid them welcome in the name of his brother, the King in the North, and asked them to thank the gods old and new for Robb's victories and the bounty of the harvest. "May there be a hundred more," he finished, raising his father's silver goblet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你不行的，别说话了，”他告诉弟弟。这时，只听罗德利克大喝一声，全场肃静。接着布兰提起嗓子，以他长兄——北境之王罗柏的名义欢迎他们，请求他们为光辉的胜利和慷慨的丰收感谢新旧诸神。“愿此福运连绵不绝，”他结束讲话，举起父亲的银杯。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ser Rodrik was seated to Bran's left, his daughter Beth beside him. Rickon was to his right, his mop of shaggy auburn hair grown so long that it brushed his ermine mantle. He had refused to let anyone cut it since their mother had gone. The last girl to try had been bitten for her efforts. "I wanted to ride too," he said as Hodor led Dancer away. "I ride better than you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗德利克爵士坐在布兰左边，他女儿贝丝陪在他身旁。瑞肯坐在布兰右手，一头杂乱的褐发已经太长，披散在白貂斗篷上。自打母亲离开，他便拒绝任何人为他修理。前次为他剪头的女侍反被他咬了一口。“我也要骑马，”阿多带走小舞时，他说，“我骑得比你好。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"A hundred more!" Pewter tankards, clay cups, and iron-banded drinking horns clashed together. Bran's wine was sweetened with honey and fragrant with cinnamon and cloves, but stronger than he was used to. He could feel its hot snaky fingers wriggling through his chest as he swallowed. By the time he set down the goblet, his head was swimming.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“连绵不绝！”白蜡酒杯，陶杯和镶铁角杯相互交碰。布兰的酒里掺了蜂蜜，还加了肉桂和丁香，喝起来甘甜可口，却比他以前喝的饮料浓烈许多。他咽下酒汁，只觉无数热辣而弯曲的手指在胸腔蜿蜒，放下杯子，脑袋一片眩晕。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Such food Bran had never seen; course after course after course, so much that he could not manage more than a bite or two of each dish. There were great joints of aurochs roasted with leeks, venison pies chunky with carrots, bacon, and mushrooms, mutton chops sauced in honey and cloves, savory duck, peppered boar, goose, skewers of pigeon and capon, beef-and-barley stew, cold fruit soup. Lord Wyman had brought twenty casks of fish from White Harbor packed in salt and seaweed; whitefish and winkles, crabs and mussels, clams, herring, cod, salmon, lobster and lampreys. There was black bread and honeycakes and oaten biscuits; there were turnips and pease and beets, beans and squash and huge red onions; there were baked apples and berry tarts and pears poached in strongwine. Wheels of white cheese were set at every table, above and below the salt, and flagons of hot spice wine and chilled autumn ale were passed up and down the tables.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布兰从未见过如此丰盛的宴席，菜肴一道又一道，目不暇接，起初他还打算每道菜都加以品尝，但很快便打消了这念头。人们端上韭菜烤野牛腿，塞满胡萝卜、培根和蘑菇的鹿肉派，涂了蜂蜜和丁香的羊排，五香鸭子，胡椒野猪肉，烤鹅，烤鸡串和鸽子串，大麦墩牛肉，冰冻水果汤。威曼大人从白港带来二十箱封在盐和藻类里的海鲜：白鲑和螺蛳，螃蟹和蚌贝，以及蛤，鲱鱼，鳕鱼，鲑鱼，龙虾和七鳃鳗。四处都是黑面包、蜂蜜蛋糕和燕麦饼干，芜箐、豌豆和甜菜，大豆、南瓜和红色大洋葱，还有烤苹果，浆果饼和烈酒煮梨。每张桌子的盐碟旁都搁着轮轮雪白的干酪，一壶壶加了香料的热葡萄酒和冰镇秋麦酒则在席间传来传去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Lord Wyman's musicians played bravely and well, but harp and fiddle and horn were soon drowned beneath a tide of talk and laughter, the clash of cup and plate, and the snarling of hounds fighting for table scraps. The singer sang good songs, "Iron Lances" and "The Burning of the Ships" and "The Bear and the Maiden Fair," but only Hodor seemed to be listening. He stood beside the piper, hopping from one foot to the other.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="威曼大人手下的乐师们热情而优雅地演奏着，然而竖琴，提琴和喇叭的乐音很快被一片欢声笑语，觥雠交错和撕打争抢剩食的狗们的吠叫所淹没。歌手们唱得悦耳动听，他们依次表演了“铁枪”，“焚船”和“狗熊与美少女”，然而全场似乎只有阿多在听。他凑到笛手旁，单脚蹦跳不休。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The noise swelled to a steady rumbling roar, a great heady stew of sound. Ser Rodrik talked with Maester Luwin above Beth's curly head, while Rickon screamed happily at the Walders. Bran had not wanted the Freys at the high table, but the maester reminded him that they would soon be kin. Robb was to marry one of their aunts, and Arya one of their uncles. "She never will," Bran said, "not Arya," but Maester Luwin was unyielding, so there they were beside Rickon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="喧哗逐渐增大，组合成持续不断的轰隆吼叫，好似一场大型合唱，教人头晕脑胀。罗德利克爵士隔着贝丝的卷发和鲁温师傅交谈，瑞肯则欢快地朝瓦德兄弟尖叫。布兰不愿佛雷兄弟坐上高台，但师傅提醒他：他们不久后就是他的亲戚了。罗柏很快要跟他们的姑妈成亲，而艾利亚会嫁给他们的叔叔。“她不会的，”布兰说，“艾利亚才不会。”但鲁温师傅不理会他的抗议，最后这两人还是坐在了瑞肯身边。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The serving men brought every dish to Bran first, that he might take the lord's portion if he chose. By the time they reached the ducks, he could eat no more. After that he nodded approval at each course in turn, and waved it away. If the dish smelled especially choice, he would send it to one of the lords on the dais, a gesture of friendship and favor that Maester Luwin told him he must make. He sent some salmon down to poor sad Lady Hornwood, the boar to the boisterous Umbers, a dish of goose-in-berries to Cley Cerwyn, and a huge lobster to Joseth the master of horse, who was neither lord nor guest, but had seen to Dancer's training and made it possible for Bran to ride. He sent sweets to Hodor and Old Nan as well, for no reason but he loved them. Ser Rodrik reminded him to send something to his foster brothers, so he sent Little Walder some boiled beets and Big Walder the buttered turnips.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每上一道菜，仆人们都先端给布兰品尝，作为最高领主，他有权选择任何菜肴中喜欢的部分。所以等端上鸭子时，他已经彻底吃不下了。之后每道菜他都只好点头示意，挥手放走。假如某个餐盘闻起来实在诱人，他便指名送给高台上某位贵族，鲁温师傅之前特地指导过他：这是友谊和荣宠的姿势。他送了些鲑鱼给可怜又忧伤的霍伍德伯爵夫人，把野猪肉赐给喧闹的安柏家人，一盘浆果填鹅给了克雷·赛文，一只巨龙虾特意端给了马房总管乔赛斯——他不是贵族领主也非特邀宾客，但小舞全赖他细心调教，布兰方才得以乘骑。他还差人把糖果给阿多和老奶妈带去，不为别的，只因他爱他们。罗德利克爵士提醒他也该送点什么给他的养兄弟，于是他给小瓦德挑了煮甜菜，给了大瓦德黄油芜箐。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On the benches below, Winterfell men mixed with smallfolk from the winter town, friends from the nearer holdfasts, and the escorts of their lordly guests. Some faces Bran had never seen before, others he knew as well as his own, yet they all seemed equally foreign to him. He watched them as from a distance, as if he still sat in the window of his bedchamber looking down on the yard below, seeing everything yet a part of nothing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一切都是虚无的一部分下方的长凳上，临冬城堡的人们，避冬市镇的平民，附近村镇的来客以及来访贵族的跟班随从们混坐在一起。其中既有许多布兰从未见过的脸孔，也有许多他认识的人，然而在他眼中，他们都显得同样地陌生。他远远望着他们，好似坐在卧房的窗边探看下方的庭院，一切的一切都是虚无的一部分。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Osha moved among the tables, pouring ale. One of Leobald Tallhart's men slid a hand up under her skirts and she broke the flagon over his head, to roars of laughter. Yet Mikken had his hand down some woman's bodice, and she seemed not to mind. Bran watched Farlen make his red bitch beg for bones and smiled at Old Nan plucking at the crust of a hot pie with wrinkled fingers. On the dais, Lord Wyman attacked a steaming plate of lampreys as if they were an enemy host. He was so fat that Ser Rodrik had commanded that a special wide chair be built for him to sit in, but he laughed loud and often, and Bran thought he liked him. Poor wan Lady Hornwood sat beside him, her face a stony mask as she picked listlessly at her food. At the opposite end of the high table, Hothen and Mors were playing a drinking game, slamming their horns together as hard as knights meeting in joust.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧莎游走席间，替人斟酒。兰巴德·陶哈的某位手下把手滑进她裙子，却立刻遭她当头一壶，酒壶粉碎，众人哄堂大笑。密肯倒真把手伸进了某个女人的胸衣，但对方并不介意。布兰看着法兰拿骨头逗他的红母狗，老奶妈用满是皱纹的手指撕热派皮的动作瞧得他呵呵直笑。高台桌旁，威曼大人向一盘热气腾腾的鳗鱼发动猛攻，仿佛那是仇敌的军队。他好胖啊，罗德利克爵士不得不特地下令制做一把极宽的椅子供他入席，不过他总是笑口常开，乐呵呵的，布兰不由得暗自喜欢上了这人。可怜的霍伍德伯爵夫人坐在他身边，面色惨白，犹如一樽石雕，无精打采地拨弄着眼前的食物。桌子另一边，霍瑟和莫尔斯正在斗酒，角杯交碰，一如骑士格斗。">查看中文翻译</div>

It is cool in the godswood now. Steam is rising off the hot pools, and the red leaves of the weirwood are rustling. The smells are richer than here, and before long the moon will rise and my brother will sing to it.</div>

<div class="line_en">I want to be a knight. Bran took another sip of the spiced honey wine from his father's goblet, grateful for something to clutch. The lifelike head of a snarling direwolf was raised on the side of the cup. He felt the silver muzzle pressing against his palm, and remembered the last time he had seen his lord father drink from this goblet. It had been the night of the welcoming feast, when King Robert had brought his court to Winterfell. Summer still reigned then. His parents had shared the dais with Robert and his queen, with her brothers beside her. Uncle Benjen had been there too, all in black. Bran and his brothers and sisters sat with the king's children, Joffrey and Tommen and Princess Myrcella, who'd spent the whole meal gazing at Robb with adoring eyes. Arya made faces across the table when no one was looking; Sansa listened raptly while the king's high harper sang songs of chivalry, and Rickon kept asking why Jon wasn't with them. "Because he's a bastard," Bran finally had to whisper to him.</div>

Jory was dead, and Fat Tom, and Porther, Alyn, Desmond, Hullen who had been master of horse, Harwin his son… all those who had gone south with his father, even Septa Mordane and Vayon Poole. The rest had ridden to war with Robb, and might soon be dead as well for all Bran knew. He liked Hayhead and Poxy Tym and Skittrick and the other new men well enough, but he missed his old friends.</div>

She wore lambskin breeches soft with long use, and a sleeveless jerkin armored in bronze scales. Though near Robb's age, she was slim as a boy, with long brown hair knotted behind her head and only the barest suggestion of breasts. A woven net hung from one slim hip, a long bronze knife from the other; under her arm she carried an old iron greathelm spotted with rust; a frog spear and round leathern shield were strapped to her back.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="布兰想说点什么。我是不是也该对他们起誓？可他们这套誓词从没人教给他听过呀。“愿汝之凛冬短暂，盛夏长驻，”最后他道，用了一句常用的祝词。“请起，我是布兰登·史塔克。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I thank you." Bran wondered if he would have to eat a frog to be polite. "I offer you the meat and mead of Winterfell." He tried to recall all he had been taught of the crannogmen, who dwelt amongst the bogs of the Neck and seldom left their wetlands. They were a poor folk, fishers and frog-hunters who lived in houses of thatch and woven reeds on floating islands hidden in the deeps of the swamp. It was said that they were a cowardly people who fought with poisoned weapons and preferred to hide from foes rather than face them in open battle. And yet Howland Reed had been one of Father's staunchest companions during the war for King Robert's crown, before Bran was born.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“谢谢。”布兰不知遵照礼节自己是否得吃青蛙。“请您们尽情享用临冬城的酒肉。”他试图回忆泽地人的习俗，他们教过他的。相传他们世代居于颈泽深处，甚少离开沼泽。这些人都很穷，以捕鱼和捉蛙为生，住在茅草和芦苇编织的小屋中，躲藏于沼泽深处隐蔽的浮岛上。据说他们是懦弱的民族，不仅惯用淬毒的武器，而且常常躲着对手打游击，不敢面对面地战斗。然而在布兰出生之前，霍兰·黎德却成为了父亲最坚定的伙伴之一，协助他为劳勃的王冠浴血奋战。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"They won't bite if I'm there." Bran was pleased that they wanted to see the wolves. "Summer won't anyway, and he'll keep Shaggydog away." He was curious about these mudmen. He could not recall ever seeing one before. His father had sent letters to the Lord of Greywater over the years, but none of the crannogmen had ever called at Winterfell. He would have liked to talk to them more, but the Great Hall was so noisy that it was hard to hear anyone who wasn't right beside you.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“只要我在，他们不会咬人。”他们想见小狼，布兰觉得很开心。“夏天从来就不会，他还会把毛毛狗赶开。”对两位“泥人”他很好奇，以前他从未见过这个民族。虽说父亲年年岁岁都给灰水望的领主写信，却从未召见一个泽地人。他想跟他们多说话，可惜大厅实在太喧哗，除了坐在身边的人，远处什么也听不清。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Much later, after all the sweets had been served and washed down with gallons of summerwine, the food was cleared and the tables shoved back against the walls to make room for the dancing. The music grew wilder, the drummers joined in, and Hother Umber brought forth a huge curved warhorn banded in silver. When the singer reached the part in "The Night That Ended" where the Night's Watch rode forth to meet the Others in the Battle for the Dawn, he blew a blast that set all the dogs to barking.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="又过了许久，当所有甜食上完，人们就着大杯夏日红咽下去之后，仆人们便清空残羹剩食，把桌子推到墙边，留出跳舞的空间。音乐愈加狂放，鼓手们参加进来。霍瑟·安柏亲提一只巨型的镶银弯战角，待歌手们唱起“终结长夜”——说的是守夜人与异鬼的黎明之战——这歌谣时，他用力吹奏应和，全厅的狗跟着狂吠。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Others soon joined in. Hodor began to dance all by himself, while Lord Wyman asked little Beth Cassel to partner him. For all his size, he moved gracefully. When he tired, Cley Cerwyn danced with the child in his stead. Ser Rodrik approached Lady Hornwood, but she made her excuses and took her leave. Bran watched long enough to be polite, and then had Hodor summoned. He was hot and tired, flushed from the wine, and the dancing made him sad. It was something else he could never do.

<div class="line_cn" title="“阿多，”阿多吼道，同时跪在地上。鲁温师傅和稻草头合力把他抱进篮子。临冬城的居民对这样的景象早已司空见惯，可对外人而言，无疑还很新鲜。想必有些客人的好奇心会超过礼仪的约束，布兰感觉得到他们的目光。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They went out the rear rather than walk the length of the hall, Bran ducking his head as they passed through the lord's door.
