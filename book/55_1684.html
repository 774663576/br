<div class="line_en">And even that number turned out to be a high-water mark, not a regular occurrence or a sign of things to come. In 1992 a strange thing happened. The homicide rate went down by almost 10 percent from the year before, and it continued to sink for another seven years, hitting 5.7 in 1999, the lowest it had been since 1966. Even more shockingly, the rate stayed put for another seven years and then drooped even further, from 5.7 in 2006 to 4.8 in 2010. The upper line in figure 3-18 plots the American homicide trend since 1950, including the new lowland we have reached in the 21st century.</div>

<div class="line_en">The parallel trajectory of Canada and the United States is one of many surprises in the great crime decline of the 1990s. The two countries differed in their economic trends and in their policies of criminal justice, yet they enjoyed similar drops in violence. So did most of the countries of Western Europe. Figure 3-19 plots the homicide rates of five major European countries over the past century, showing the historical trajectory we have been tracking: a long-term decline that lasted until the 1960s, an uptick that began in that tumultuous decade, and the recent return to more peaceable rates. Every major Western European country showed a decline, and though it looked for a while as if England and Ireland would be the exceptions, in the 2000s their rates dropped as well.</div>

Canadians kill at less than a third of the rate of Americans, partly because in the 19th century the Mounties got to the western frontier before the settlers and spared them from having to cultivate a violent code of honor. Despite this difference, the ups and downs of the Canadian homicide rate parallel those of their neighbor to the south (with a correlation coefficient between 1961 and 2009 of 0.85), and it sank almost as much in the 1990s: 35 percent, compared to the American decline of 42 percent.</div>

In the United States the rates of every category of major crime dropped by about half, including rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, larceny, and even auto theft. The effects were visible not just in the statistics but in the fabric of everyday life.

<div class="line_en">As legendary New York mayor Fiorello La Guardia might have said, "When I make a mistake, it's a beaut!" (Wilson was a good sport about it, remarking, "Social scientists should never try to predict the future; they have enough trouble predicting the past.") The mistake of the murder mavens was to have put too much faith in the most recent demographic trends. The crack-fueled violence bubble of the late 1980s involved large numbers of teenagers, and the population of teenagers was set to grow in the 1990s as an echo of the baby boom. But the overall crime-prone cohort, which includes twenty-somethings as well as teenagers, actually fell in the 1990s. Even this corrected statistic, though, cannot explain the decline of crime in that decade. The age distribution of a population changes slowly, as each demographic pig makes its way through the population python. But in the 1990s the crime rate lurched downward for seven straight years and promptly parked itself at its new bottom for another nine. As with the takeoff of crime in the 1960s, changes in the rate of violence for each age cohort swamped the effect of the size of those cohorts.</div>

<div class="line_en">The other usual suspect in explaining crime trends, the economy, did little better in explaining this one. Though unemployment went down in the United States in the 1990s, it went up in Canada, yet violent crime decreased in Canada as well. France and Germany also saw unemployment go up while violence went down, whereas Ireland and the U. K. saw unemployment go down while violence went up. This is not as surprising as it first appears, since criminologists have long known that unemployment rates don't correlate well with rates of violent crime. (They do correlate somewhat with rates of property crime.) Indeed, in the three years after the financial meltdown of 2008, which caused the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression, the American homicide rate fell by another 14 percent, leading the criminologist David Kennedy to explain to a reporter, "The idea that everyone has ingrained into them -- that as the economy goes south, crime has to get worse -- is wrong. It was never right to begin with."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="还有一个疑问就是用经济来解释暴力趋势，其效果未见得比人口构成说更有说服力。虽然美国90年代的失业率一直在下降，在加拿大却是上升的，但加拿大的犯罪也减少了。法国和德国都是在失业增加的同时出现了暴力下降。现在人们已经不再对此觉得惊讶了，犯罪学家早已知道失业率和暴力犯罪率之间的相关性并不高。（与失业率具有某种相关性的是财产犯罪。）2008年发生的金融危机是自大萧条以来最大的经济衰退，此后的三年内，美国的凶杀率又下降了14%。犯罪学家戴维·肯尼迪（David Kennedy）对记者解释说：“人们有个根深蒂固的观念，认为一旦经济恶化，犯罪也会恶化——这个观念现在是错误的，而且从来就没正确过。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Among economic measures, inequality is generally a better predictor of violence than unemployment. But the Gini coefficient, the standard index of income inequality, actually rose in the United States from 1990 to 2000, while crime was falling, and it had hit its low point in 1968, when crime was soaring. The problem with invoking inequality to explain changes in violence is that while it correlates with violence across states and countries, it does not correlate with violence over time within a state or country, possibly because the real cause of the differences is not inequality per se but stable features of a state's governance or culture that affect both inequality and violence. (For example, in unequal societies, poor neighborhoods are left without police protection and can become zones of violent anarchy.)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在经济指标中，“不平等”通常比“失业”能够更准确地预测暴力水平。但是基尼系数，即测量收入不平等的指标，在1990年至2000年间是上升的，犯罪却是下降的，而基尼系数在1968年达到历史性的低点，犯罪却开始飙升。求助收入不平等来解释暴力水平的问题在于，即使在全州或者全国的范围内，两者呈现相关性，但在一个州或者一个国家的内部，两者之间仍然缺乏相关性。这一差距的真正原因是，促生暴力的不是不平等本身，而是国家管治和文化的特性，正是这种特性同时造成了不平等和暴力。（比如，在一个不平等的社会，贫民区没有警力保护，很有可能成为暴力肆虐的三不管地带。）">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The 1990s crime decline inspired one of the stranger hypotheses in the study of violence. When I told people I was writing a book on the historical decline of violence, I was repeatedly informed that the phenomenon had already been solved. Rates of violence have come down, they explained to me, because after abortion was legalized by the 1973 Roe v. Wade U. S. Supreme Court decision, the unwanted children who would ordinarily have grown up to be criminals were not born in the first place, because their begrudging or unfit mothers had had abortions instead. I first heard of this theory in 2001 when it was proposed by the economists John Donohue and Steven Levitt, but it seemed too cute to be true. Any hypothesis that comes out of left field to explain a massive social trend with a single overlooked event will almost certainly turn out to be wrong, even if it has some data supporting it at the time. But Levitt, together with the journalist Stephen Dubner, popularized the theory in their bestseller Freakonomics, and now a large proportion of the public believes that crime went down in the 1990s because women aborted their crime-fated fetuses in the 1970s.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="受90年代暴力下降的启发，暴力研究中出现了一个非常古怪的假设。当我告诉别人我正在写作一本书，主题是暴力下降的历史时，不断有人对我说，这个问题已经解决了。他们解释说，暴力水平之所以下降，是因为1973年美国最高法院对罗伊诉韦德案的裁决。堕胎合法化后，那些本来没有人愿意生养，成人后又大多成为罪犯的孩子，就不用出生了；那些不情不愿的或者不合格的母亲们，从此可以选择堕胎了。我在2001年第一次听到这种理论，当时是经济学家约翰·多诺霍（John Donohue）和史蒂文·莱维特（Steven Levitt）提出的。我觉得这简直实在太好玩了，不可能是真实的。任何假说，只要它来自于外行，想用一个单一的、被忽略了的事件解释重大的社会现象，几乎肯定是一个谬误，即使它当时能找到一些数据作为支持。不过，莱维特和记者斯蒂芬·迪布内（Stephen Dubner）一起创作了畅销书《魔鬼经济学》（Freakonomics），将这一理论普及到大众。现在，大部分公众都相信90年代犯罪率下跌是因为70年代的妇女打掉了有犯罪宿命的胎儿。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">To be fair, Levitt went on to argue that Roe v. Wade was just one of four causes of the crime decline, and he has presented sophisticated correlational statistics in support of the connection. For example, he showed that the handful of states that legalized abortion before 1973 were the first to see their crime rates go down. But these statistics compare the two ends of a long, hypothetical, and tenuous causal chain -- the availability of legal abortion as the first link and the decline in crime two decades later as the last -- and ignore all the links in between. The links include the assumptions that legal abortion causes fewer unwanted children, that unwanted children are more likely to become criminals, and that the first abortion-culled generation was the one spearheading the 1990s crime decline. But there are other explanations for the overall correlation (for example, that the large liberal states that first legalized abortion were also the first states to see the rise and fall of the crack epidemic), and the intermediate links have turned out to be fragile or nonexistent.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="公平地说，莱维特强调，罗伊诉韦德案只是导致犯罪下降的四个因素之一，他也给出了精巧的相关性统计学分析证明这一关联。比如，1973年之前，有几个州堕胎已经合法化，而犯罪率最先出现下降的也是这几个州。但是，这些统计数据是对一条漫长的、有假设前提的、牵强的因果链的两端进行比较——能够得到合法堕胎为第一环，20年后的犯罪下降为最末一环——中间的所有环节都被忽略了。这些环节包括几个假设，堕胎导致讨人厌的孩子减少，讨人厌的孩子有更大的可能成为罪犯，以及第一代经过堕胎筛选的年轻人引领90年代犯罪下降的先锋。但是，对于两者之间的相关性还有其他的解释（比如，在最先通过堕胎合法化的自由派各州，毒品瘟疫的发生和结束也比较早），而中间的各个过渡环节，不是非常脆弱，就是根本不存在。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">What about differences among individual women within a crime-prone population? Here the freakonomics theory would seem to get things backwards. Among women who are accidentally pregnant and unprepared to raise a child, the ones who terminate their pregnancies are likely to be forward-thinking, realistic, and disciplined, whereas the ones who carry the child to term are more likely to be fatalistic, disorganized, or immaturely focused on the thought of a cute baby rather than an unruly adolescent. Several studies have borne this out. Young pregnant women who opt for abortions get better grades, are less likely to be on welfare, and are more likely to finish school than their counterparts who have miscarriages or carry their pregnancies to term. The availability of abortion thus may have led to a generation that is more prone to crime because it weeded out just the children who, whether through genes or environment, were most likely to exercise maturity and self-control.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在有犯罪倾向的人口内部，妇女个体之间有什么差异吗？魔鬼经济学理论似乎是全面倒退的。在意外怀孕并且不准备抚养孩子的妇女中，选择终止妊娠被看作向前看、有现实感、能够自律；而接受怀孕生下孩子，则属于听天由命、没有条理，或者很不成熟，只想到可怜可爱的婴儿，而想不到不服管教的青春期。颇有几项研究力图证明这个观点。在年轻孕妇中，与完成妊娠或者发生流产的人相比，选择堕胎的人有更好的学习成绩，更少申请福利，也更有可能完成学业。但如此来说，堕胎的可获得性，也可以导致出现犯罪倾向更强的一代人，因为通过基因选择或者环境选择，它淘汰了那些最有可能思考和有自制力的人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">To begin with, the freakonomics theory assumes that women were just as likely to have conceived unwanted children before and after 1973, and that the only difference was whether the children were born. But once abortion was legalized, couples may have treated it as a backup method of birth control and may have engaged in more unprotected sex. If the women conceived more unwanted children in the first place, the option of aborting more of them could leave the proportion of unwanted children the same. In fact, the proportion of unwanted children could even have increased if women were emboldened by the abortion option to have more unprotected sex in the heat of the moment, but then procrastinated or had second thoughts once they were pregnant. That may help explain why in the years since 1973 the proportion of children born to women in the most vulnerable categories -- poor, single, teenage, and African American -- did not decrease, as the freakonomics theory would predict. It increased, and by a lot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="首先，魔鬼经济学理论假定，妇女刚好在1973年前后可能受孕怀上不想要的孩子，此后唯一的影响因素就是孩子是否被生出来。一旦堕胎合法化，男女双方有了堕胎做避孕的备份方案，也就很有可能进行更多不加防护的性生活。如果妇女会怀上更多“不想要的孩子”，堕胎这个选择，也不过是让“不想要的孩子”的比例保持不变而已。事实上，“不想要的孩子”的比例甚至可能会升高，妇女们有了堕胎撑腰壮胆，在性解放运动的高潮中有了更多不加防护的性爱。但是，一旦发现怀孕，又开始拖延犹豫或者变了主意。这也许真能解释为什么1973年之后，美国妇女中最弱势的几个群体——贫困、单身、青少年和非裔——出生的孩子，在新生儿总人口中的比例没有减少。魔鬼经济学的理论预测没有实现。而且，这一比例增加了，增加的幅度还非常大。">查看中文翻译</div>

Leapin' lizards! That's why I'm so bad!" And it is about as plausible. Though unwanted children may grow up to commit more crimes, it is more likely that women in crime-prone environments have more unwanted children than that unwantedness causes criminal behavior directly. In studies that pit the effects of parenting against the effects of the children's peer environment, holding genes constant, the peer environment almost always wins.</div>

<div class="line_en">Finally, if easy abortion after 1973 sculpted a more crime-averse generation, the crime decline should have begun with the youngest group and then crept up the age brackets as they got older. The sixteen-year-olds of 1993, for example (who were born in 1977, when abortions were in full swing), should have committed fewer crimes than the sixteen-year-olds of 1983 (who were born in 1967, when abortion was illegal). By similar logic, the twenty-two-year-olds of 1993 should have remained violent, because they were born in pre-Roe 1971. Only in the late 1990s, when the first post-Roe generation reached their twenties, should the twenty-something age bracket have become less violent. In fact, the opposite happened. When the first post-Roe generation came of age in the late 1980s and early 1990s, they did not tug the homicide statistics downward; they indulged in an unprecedented spree of mayhem. The crime decline began when the older cohorts, born well before Roe, laid down their guns and knives, and from them the lower homicide rates trickled down the age scale.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，如果1973年后的堕胎合法化塑造了具有抵制犯罪倾向的新生代，犯罪率的下降就应该从最年轻的人口组开始逐渐升高，年龄越大的人口组，犯罪率越高。比如，1993年16岁的青少年，在堕胎普遍化之后的1977年出生，应该比1983年的同年龄组的人犯罪率低。1983年时16岁的孩子出生于1967年，当时堕胎还是非法的。按照同样的逻辑，1993年时22岁的青年应该是富于暴力的，因为他们出生在堕胎合法化之前的1971年。只有到了90年代后期，合法堕胎时代出生的第一批婴儿进入二十多岁，20岁这个年龄组的犯罪率才应该开始下降。但事实却完全相反。80年代后期和90年代初期，合法堕胎年代出生的第一代人到了法定年龄，他们不仅没有压低凶杀的统计数字，反而带来了前所未有的大混乱。而在罗伊案裁决之前出生的、年龄略长的这批人放下刀枪的时候，犯罪率开始下降，并从这个年龄组开始传递给后面的年龄组。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">By the early 1990s, Americans had gotten sick of the muggers, vandals, and drive-by shootings, and the country beefed up the criminal justice system in several ways. The most effective was also the crudest: putting more men behind bars for longer stretches of time. The rate of imprisonment in the United States was pretty much flat from the 1920s to the early 1960s, and it even declined a bit until the early 1970s. But then it shot up almost fivefold, and today more than two million Americans are in jail, the highest incarceration rate on the planet. That works out to three-quarters of a percent of the entire population, and a much larger percentage of young men, especially African Americans. The American imprisonment binge was set off in the 1980s by several developments. Among them were mandatory sentencing laws (such as California's "Three Strikes and You're Out"), a prison-building boom (in which rural communities that had formerly shouted "Not in my backyard!" now welcomed the economic stimulus), and the War on Drugs (which criminalized possession of small amounts of cocaine and other controlled substances).</div>

<div class="line_en">Unlike the more gimmicky theories of the crime decline, massive imprisonment is almost certain to lower crime rates because the mechanism by which it operates has so few moving parts. Imprisonment physically removes the most crime-prone individuals from the streets, incapacitating them and subtracting the crimes they would have committed from the statistics. Incarceration is especially effective when a small number of individuals commit a large number of crimes. A classic study of criminal records in Philadelphia, for example, found that 6 percent of the young male population committed more than half the offenses. The people who commit the most crimes expose themselves to the most opportunities to get caught, and so they are the ones most likely to be skimmed off and sent to jail. Moreover, people who commit violent crimes get into trouble in other ways, because they tend to favor instant gratification over long-term benefits. They are more likely to drop out of school, quit work, get into accidents, provoke fights, engage in petty theft and vandalism, and abuse alcohol and drugs. A regime that trawls for drug users or other petty delinquents will net a certain number of violent people as bycatch, further thinning the ranks of the violent people who remain on the streets.</div>

<div class="line_en">Incarceration can also reduce violence by the familiar but less direct route of deterrence. An ex-convict might think twice about committing another crime once he gets out of jail, and the people who know about him might think twice about following in his footsteps. But proving that incarceration deters people (as opposed to incapacitating them) is easier said than done, because the statistics at any time are inherently stacked against it. The regions with the highest rates of crime will throw the most people in jail, creating the illusion that imprisonment increases crime rather than decreasing it. But with suitable ingenuity (for example, correlating increases in imprisonment at one time with decreases in crime at a later time, or seeing if a court order to reduce the prison population leads to a subsequent increase in crime), the deterrence effect can be tested. Analyses by Levitt and other statisticians of crime suggest that deterrence works. Those who prefer real-world experiments to sophisticated statistics may take note of the Montreal police strike of 1969. Within hours of the gendarmes abandoning their posts, that famously safe city was hit with six bank robberies, twelve arsons, a hundred lootings, and two homicides before the Mounties were called in to restore order.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="监禁还具有间接威慑的作用。一个被判过刑的人出狱后，再次犯罪之前会有所犹豫，而熟识他的人，也会吸取他的教训。要证明监禁对人有不良影响（因为他们无法再进入社会），说起来容易，做起来则很困难，因为所有的统计数据都不支持这个观点。犯罪率高的地区，关进监狱的罪犯也多，这就造成一种假象，似乎是监押带来了高犯罪率，而不是减少犯罪。但是，如果方法得当（比如，检视某一时间在押犯的增长和稍后一段时间的犯罪下降是否相关，或者，检视法庭下令减少在押犯人数之后，是否导致犯罪上升），监押的威慑效力是可以测试的。莱维特和其他犯罪统计学家的分析认为确实存在威慑效应。有人总是更喜欢真实世界的经验，而不是精巧的统计模型，他们可以去看看1969年蒙特利尔警察罢工的故事。警察们刚刚放弃他们的岗位，几个小时之内，蒙特利尔这个以安全出名的城市就发生了6起银行抢劫案、12起纵火案、100起商店洗劫案、两起谋杀案。当局紧急召回所有警察恢复社会秩序。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mass incarceration, even if it does lower violence, introduces problems of its own. Once the most violent individuals have been locked up, imprisoning more of them rapidly reaches a point of diminishing returns, because each additional prisoner become less and less dangerous, and pulling them off the streets makes a smaller and smaller dent in the violence rate. Also, since people tend to get less violent as they get older, keeping men in prison beyond a certain point does little to reduce crime. For all these reasons, there is an optimum rate of incarceration. It's unlikely that the American criminal justice system will find it, because electoral politics keep ratcheting the incarceration rate upward, particularly in jurisdictions in which judges are elected rather than appointed. Any candidate who suggests that too many people are going to jail for too long will be targeted in an opponent's television ads as "soft on crime" and booted out of office. The result is that the United States imprisons far more people than it should, with disproportionate harm falling on African American communities who have been stripped of large numbers of men.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大规模的监禁即使能够降低暴力，其本身也会产生新的问题。一旦将暴力倾向最强的那部分人锁进牢房，继续监押更多的犯人，降低暴力犯罪率的效果会迅速递减并消失。因为新来的犯人危险性越来越小，将他们从社会上清除出去，对暴力犯罪率产生的影响微乎其微。而且，随着年龄的增长，人的暴力倾向会减弱，对超过一定年龄的犯人继续监押，对减少犯罪率也没有多少意义。为此，监押水平存在一个最优度。但美国的刑事司法系统很难把握这个最优，因为在选举政治的压力下，监押率只会不断上升；在民选法官，而不是任命法官的选区，情况更是如此。任何一个候选人，只要他胆敢表示监狱里关押的人已经太多而且时间也太长，竞选对手就会在电视广告上说此人“对犯罪心慈手软”，并将此人赶出政坛。结果，美国的监狱关押了太多不应被关押的人，尤其是对美国黑人不合比例的高监押率，让非裔社区丧失了大量的男性成员。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But the case that the incarceration boom led to the crime decline is far from watertight. For one thing, the prison bulge began in the 1980s, but violence did not decline until a decade later. For another, Canada did not go on an imprisonment binge, but its violence rate went down too. These facts don't disprove the theory that imprisonment mattered, but they force it to make additional assumptions, such as that the effect of imprisonment builds up over time, reaches a critical mass, and spills over national borders.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，说监押人数暴涨导致犯罪下降，也不是无懈可击的。首先，监狱的膨胀始于80年代，而暴力的下降是10年之后才出现的。其次，加拿大并没有扩张监狱，但暴力犯罪还是减少了。这些事实尽管不能否认监押效应，但确实要求给这一理论附加一些假设，比如，监押效果需要时间逐渐生效，并在达到某个临界点之后，向全国扩散。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A second way in which Leviathan became more effective in the 1990s was a ballooning of the police. In a stroke of political genius, President Bill Clinton undercut his conservative opponents in 1994 by supporting legislation that promised to add 100,000 officers to the nation's police forces. Additional cops not only nab more criminals but are more noticeable by their presence, deterring people from committing crimes in the first place. And many of the police earned back their old nickname flatfoots by walking a beat and keeping an eye on the neighborhood rather than sitting in cars and awaiting a radio call before speeding to a crime scene. In some cities, like Boston, the police were accompanied by parole officers who knew the worst troublemakers individually and had the power to have them rearrested for the slightest infraction. In New York, police headquarters tracked neighborhood crime reports obsessively and held captains' feet to the fire if the crime rate in their precinct started to drift upward. The visibility of the police was multiplied by a mandate to go after nuisance crimes like graffiti, littering, aggressive panhandling, drinking liquor or urinating in public, and extorting cash from drivers at stoplights after a cursory wipe of their windshield with a filthy squeegee. The rationale, originally articulated by James Q. Wilson and George Kelling in their famous Broken Windows theory, was that an orderly environment serves as a reminder that police and residents are dedicated to keeping the peace, whereas a vandalized and unruly one is a signal that no one is in charge.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="90年代利维坦提高效率的第二个方式是扩张警察队伍。克林顿总统不愧是一位政治天才。1994年，他支持立法，给美国增加了10万警力，并由此出奇制胜地压倒了对手。新增的警力不仅可以制止更多的犯罪，而且这些警察在街头出现本身就让很多人放弃了犯罪的念头。美国英文中的“扁平足”原来在人们口语中就是“警察”的意思，现在他们又赢回了这一称号。很多警察重新开始在街区内步行巡逻，不再是仅仅坐在警车内等待呼叫后再赶往犯罪现场。在有些城市，比如波士顿，警察和假释官一起巡逻。假释官对那些最糟糕的前科犯人的情况了如指掌，而且有权为任何过失再次逮捕他们。在纽约，警察总局迫不及待地追踪各个街区的犯罪报告，一旦发现犯罪率有所上升，就立刻向分局的局长问责并施压。警察的可见度成倍提高，即使是对那些轻罪，比如涂鸦、乱扔垃圾、进攻性乞讨、在公共场所喝酒和便溺，以及在红绿灯处强行擦拭挡风玻璃并索取现金，他们也不会坐视不理。詹姆斯·Q·威尔逊和乔治·克林（George Kelling）在他们著名的“破窗理论”中首先提到，一个整洁的环境告诉大家，此地的警方和居民决心协力维持治安，而一个乱涂乱画和又脏又乱的环境则意味着此地属于三不管地带。">查看中文翻译</div>

Research on this question is the usual social science rat's nest of confounded variables, but the big picture suggests that the answer is "yes, in part," even if we can't pinpoint which of the innovations did the trick. Not only do several analyses suggest that something in the new policing reduced crime, but the jurisdiction that spent the most effort in perfecting its police, New York City, showed the greatest reduction of all. Once the epitome of urban rot, New York is now one of America's safest cities, having enjoyed a slide in the crime rate that was twice the national average and that continued in the 2000s after the decline in the rest of the country had run out of steam. As the criminologist Franklin Zimring put it in The Great American Crime Decline, "If the combination of more cops, more aggressive policing, and management reforms did account for as much as a 35% crime decrease (half the [U.

Above the bicycles was a prominent sign prohibiting graffiti and a wall that the experimenters had either covered in graffiti (the experimental condition) or left clean (the control condition). When the commuters were in the presence of the illegal graffiti, twice as many of them threw the flyer on the ground -- exactly what the Broken Windows theory predicted. In other studies, people littered more when they saw unreturned shopping carts strewn about, and when they heard illegal firecrackers being set off in the distance. It wasn't just harmless infractions like littering that were affected. In another experiment, passersby were tempted by an addressed envelope protruding from a mailbox with a five-euro bill visible inside it. When the mailbox was covered in graffiti or surrounded by litter, a quarter of the passersby stole it; when the mailbox was clean, half that many did.

A greater awareness of rape and sexual abuse made the ethos "If it feels good, do it" seem repugnant rather than liberating.

<div class="line_en">The result was a wave of civilizing offensives. As we will see in chapter 7, one positive legacy of the 1960s was the revolutions in civil rights, women's rights, children's rights, and gay rights, which began to consolidate power in the 1990s as the baby boomers became the establishment. Their targeting of rape, battering, hate crimes, gay-bashing, and child abuse reframed law-and-order from a reactionary cause to a progressive one, and their efforts to make the home, workplace, schools, and streets safer for vulnerable groups (as in the feminist "Take Back the Night" protests) made these environments safer for everyone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随之而来的是文明攻势的浪潮。我们将在第7章看到，60年代的一个积极的遗产是民权、女权、儿童权利和同性恋权利的革命。随着婴儿潮一代在90年代成为正统，这些权利运动开始整合力量。他们将强奸、殴打妻子、仇恨犯罪、欺凌同性恋和虐待儿童纳入法律与秩序的框架，从一种反叛型的运动变成一种进步型的事业；他们努力将家庭、工作场所、学校和街道变得对弱势群体更加安全（比如女权主义者举行反对强暴妇女的大示威“还我安宁夜”），从而也是对所有的人都更加安全。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One of the most impressive civilizing offensives of the 1990s came from African American communities, who set themselves the task of recivilizing their young men. As with the pacifying of the American West a century before, much of the moral energy came from women and the church. In Boston a team of clergymen led by Ray Hammond, Eugene Rivers, and Jeffrey Brown worked in partnership with the police and social service agencies to clamp down on gang violence. They leveraged their knowledge of local communities to identify the most dangerous gang members and put them on notice that the police and community were watching them, sometimes in meetings with their gangs, sometimes in meetings with their mothers and grandmothers. Community leaders also disrupted cycles of revenge by converging on any gang member who had recently been aggrieved and leaning on him to forswear vengeance. The interventions were effective not just because of the threat of an arrest but because the external pressure provided the men with an "out" that allowed them to back off without losing face, much as two brawling men may accede to being pulled apart by weaker interceders. These efforts contributed to the "Boston Miracle" of the 1990s in which the homicide rate dropped fivefold; it has remained low, with some fluctuations, ever since.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="90年代一场令人印象最深刻的文明攻势来自美国非裔社区。他们肩负起重新教化自己的年轻人的重任。和一百年前美国西部的平定一样，主要的道德源泉是妇女和教会。在波士顿，雷·哈蒙德、尤金·里弗斯和杰弗里·布朗带领一伙神职人员与警方和政府的社工机构合作，铲除黑帮暴力。他们熟悉当地社区的情况，知道谁是最危险的帮派团伙的成员。他们向这些人发出通知，警告他们警方和社区在监视他们。他们不是与这些帮派分子谈话，就是找他们的母亲或者祖母谈话。社区领袖的努力截断了冤冤相报的循环，他们与那些刚刚受到过欺压的帮会成员谈话，劝说加施压要求他们放弃报复。这样的干涉之所以有效，不仅是因为有了被逮捕的恐惧，而且，这样的外部压力给了帮会成员一个“退缩”的借口，让他们在让步的同时又不失去面子，很像是一位孱弱的求情人往往能劝解开两个打架的强壮男人。这些努力共同造就了90年代的“波士顿奇迹”——凶杀率下降至原来的1/5；自该时期至今，尽管有些波动，但一直维持在相当低的水平。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The police and courts, for their part, have been redirecting their use of criminal punishment from brute deterrence and incapacitation to the second stage of a civilizing process, enhancing the perceived legitimacy of government force. When a criminal justice system works properly, it's not because rational actors know that Big Brother is watching them 24/7 and will swoop down and impose a cost that will cancel any ill-gotten gain. No democracy has the resources or the will to turn society into that kind of Skinner box. Only a sample of criminal behavior can ever be detected and punished, and the sampling should be fair enough that citizens perceive the entire regime to be legitimate. A key legitimator is the perception that the system is set up in such a way that a person, and more importantly the person's adversaries, face a constant chance of being punished if they break the law, so that they all may internalize inhibitions against predation, preemptive attack, and vigilante retribution. But in many American jurisdictions, the punishments had been so capricious as to appear like misfortunes coming out of the blue rather than predictable consequences of proscribed behavior. Offenders skipped probation hearings or failed drug tests with impunity, and they saw their peers get away with it as well, but then one day, in what they experienced as a stroke of bad luck, they were suddenly sent away for years.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="警察和法庭也发挥了他们的作用。他们将工作的重心从严刑峻法及其威慑，转移到文明进程的第二个阶段，强化人们心目中政府权力的正当性。一旦执法和司法系统运作有效，有头脑的小兄弟们就知道，“老大哥”——政府时时刻刻都在盯着他们，随时准备扑向他们，让他们的非法生意血本无归。没有哪个民主制度有这样的资源或者意愿，能够将社会变成某种“斯金纳箱”。犯罪行为中只有很少的一部分“样本”能够被发现，并受到惩罚，所以取样要足够的公平，公民们才会认为整个政府具有合法性。决定一个制度的正当性的关键因素是，必须让人们感觉到，这个制度确立之后，每一个人，更重要的是还有每个人的敌人，都明白犯法必会受到惩罚，所以他们会产生内在的自我约束，不去从事掠夺、先发制人的进攻以及滥用私刑这些勾当。但是，过去在美国许多地区的法庭上，刑罚的裁处没有一定之规，非常随意，对于被告，判刑更像是一场飞来横祸，而不是某种特定行为带来的可预见的后果。罪犯缺席假释听证会，或者被检验证明吸毒却不受惩罚，他们看见其他的罪犯也是这样干的，而且也都没有受到惩罚。但是，某一天，他们突然被判监禁，刑期长达数年，他们当然想不明白，只能觉得这完全是自己厄运当头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But now judges, working with police and community leaders, are broadening their crime-fighting strategy from draconian yet unpredictable punishments for big crimes to small yet reliable punishments for smaller ones -- a guarantee, for example, that missing a probation hearing will net the offender a few days in jail. The shift exploits two features of our psychology (which will be explored in the chapter on our better angels). One is that people -- especially the people who are likely to get in trouble with the law -- steeply discount the future, and respond more to certain and immediate punishments than to hypothetical and delayed ones. The other is that people conceive of their relationships with other people and institutions in moral terms, categorizing them either as contests of raw dominance or as contracts governed by reciprocity and fairness. Steven Alm, a judge who devised a "probation with enforcement" program, summed up the reason for the program's success: "When the system isn't consistent and predictable, when people are punished randomly, they think, My probation officer doesn't like me, or, Someone's prejudiced against me, rather than seeing that everyone who breaks a rule is treated equally, in precisely the same way."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是现在，法官和警察以及社区领袖一起办案，他们对付犯罪的策略更多样了，对重罪犯处以严厉得出乎意料的重刑，对轻罪犯则采取轻惩但必罚的政策。比如，缺席一次假释听证的罪犯，一定会被带回监狱吃几天牢饭。这一转变其实是利用了人们的两个心理特性（我们将在“善良天使”一章再做详细解释）。一个特性是，人，特别是有违法犯罪倾向的人，总是不看重未来，对假定的和滞后的惩罚比较麻木，但对确定的和立即发生的惩罚则会有较强烈的反应。另一个特性是，人都是在道德层面上构想自己与其他人以及与各种组织的相互关系，将这些关系分为两类，或者是原始的实力竞争，或者是互惠和公平原则下的合约。史蒂文·阿尔姆法官设计了一套成功的“强制假释”制度，他这样总结说：“如果一套制度在执行中不能做到言必信、行必果，对违规的处罚漫无章法，人们就会认为，‘我的假释官不喜欢我’，或者‘某某对我有偏见’，而不是所有的违规者都受到同样的对待。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The newer offensive to tamp down violence also aims to enhance the habits of empathy and self-control that are the internal enforcers of the Civilizing Process. The Boston effort was named the TenPoint Coalition after a manifesto with ten stated goals, such as to "Promote and campaign for a cultural shift to help reduce youth violence within the Black community, both physically and verbally, by initiating conversations, introspection and reflection on the thoughts and actions that hold us back as a people, individually and collectively." One of the programs with which it has joined forces, Operation Ceasefire, was explicitly designed by David Kennedy to implement Immanuel Kant's credo that "morality predicated on external pressures alone is never sufficient." The journalist John Seabrook describes one of its empathy-building events:</div>

<div class="line_en">At the one I attended, there was a palpable, almost evangelical desire to make the experience transformative for the gangbangers. An older ex-gang member named Arthur Phelps, whom everyone called Pops, wheeled a thirty-seven-year-old woman in a wheelchair to the center of the room. Her name was Margaret Long, and she was paralyzed from the chest down. "Seventeen years ago, I shot this woman," Phelps said, weeping. "And I live with that every day of my life." Then Long cried out, "And I go to the bathroom in a bag," and she snatched out the colostomy bag from inside the pocket of her wheelchair and held it up while the young men stared in horror. When the final speaker, a street worker named Aaron Pullins III, yelled, "Your house is on fire! Your building is burning! You've got to save yourselves! Stand up!," three-quarters of the group jumped to their feet, as if they had been jerked up like puppets on strings.</div>

<div class="line_en">The 1990s civilizing offensive also sought to glorify the values of responsibility that make a life of violence less appealing. Two highly publicized rallies in the nation's capital, one organized by black men, one by white, affirmed the obligation of men to support their children: Louis Farrakhan's Million Man March, and a march by the Promise Keepers, a conservative Christian movement. Though both movements had unsavory streaks of ethnocentrism, sexism, and religious fundamentalism, their historical significance lay in the larger recivilizing process they exemplified. In The Great Disruption, the political scientist Francis Fukuyama notes that as rates of violence went down in the 1990s, so did most other indicators of social pathology, such as divorce, welfare dependency, teenage pregnancy, dropping out of school, sexually transmitted disease, and teenage auto and gun accidents.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="90年代的文明攻势诉诸赞颂责任价值观，引导年轻人远离充斥暴力的生活。美国首都华盛顿曾经举行过两次引人瞩目的大游行，分别是由黑人路易斯·法拉汉组织的“百万男人大进军”和由白人基督教保守派运动“守约者”组织的大游行。两者的宗旨都是宣示男子承担抚育孩子的责任。虽然两者都带有令人不安的种族中心主义、性别歧视和宗教极端主义的印迹，它们在其所弘扬的文明回归进程中都具有历史性的意义。在《大分裂》（The Great Disruption）一书中，政治学家弗朗西斯·福山（Francis Fukuyama）说，随着90年代暴力犯罪率的下降，其他指示社会病态的指标，比如离婚率、福利依赖率、少女怀孕率、退学率、性病率以及青少年车祸案和青少年枪伤案也都下降了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The recivilizing process of the past two decades is not just a resumption of the currents that have swept the West since the Middle Ages. For one thing, unlike the original Civilizing Process, which was a by-product of the consolidation of states and the growth of commerce, the recent crime decline has largely come from civilizing offensives that were consciously designed to enhance people's well-being. Also new is a dissociation between the superficial trappings of civilization and the habits of empathy and self-control that we care the most about.</div>

<div class="line_en">One way in which the 1990s did not overturn the decivilization of the 1960s is in popular culture. Many of the popular musicians in recent genres such as punk, metal, goth, grunge, gangsta, and hip-hop make the Rolling Stones look like the Women's Christian Temperance Union. Hollywood movies are bloodier than ever, unlimited pornography is a mouse-click away, and an entirely new form of violent entertainment, video games, has become a major pastime. Yet as these signs of decadence proliferated in the culture, violence went down in real life. The recivilizing process somehow managed to reverse the tide of social dysfunction without turning the cultural clock back to Ozzie and Harriet. The other evening I was riding a crowded Boston subway car and saw a fearsome-looking young man clad in black leather, shod in jackboots, painted with tattoos, and pierced by rings and studs. The other passengers were giving him a wide berth when he bellowed, "Isn't anyone going to give up his seat for this old woman? She could be your grandmother!"</div>

<div class="line_en">The cliché about Generation X, who came of age in the 1990s, was that they were media-savvy, ironic, postmodern. They could adopt poses, try on styles, and immerse themselves in seedy cultural genres without taking any of them too seriously. (In this regard they were more sophisticated than the boomers in their youth, who treated the drivel of rock musicians as serious political philosophy.) Today this discernment is exercised by much of Western society. In his 2000 book Bobos in Paradise, the journalist David Brooks observed that many members of the middle class have become "bourgeois bohemians" who affect the look of people at the fringes of society while living a thoroughly conventional lifestyle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所谓“被遗忘的一代”在90年代成人并进入社会，都说他们精于传播、诙谐讥讽，属于后现代派。他们也许会模仿一些身段，尝试一些时尚，甚至让自己沉浸在破烂文化的布景中，但却不会对其中任何一种玩意儿真心投入。（在这一点上，他们比婴儿潮那一代年轻人要精明老到得多，老一代人当年真心地将那些摇滚音乐家的胡言乱语奉为严肃政治哲学般的金科玉律。）今天的西方社会已经不再缺少这样的洞察力。记者戴维·布鲁克斯（David Brooks）2000年在《天堂里的波波族》（Bobos in Paradise）一书中提到他的观察，中产阶级中的许多人成为“布尔乔亚—波西米亚人”——反传统的中产阶级；这些人以社会边缘人的姿态，享受着完全正统的生活方式。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Cas Wouters, inspired by conversations with Elias late in his life, suggests that we are living through a new phase in the Civilizing Process. This is the long-term trend of informalization I mentioned earlier, and it leads to what Elias called a "controlled decontrolling of emotional controls" and what Wouters calls third nature. If our first nature consists of the evolved motives that govern life in a state of nature, and our second nature consists of the ingrained habits of a civilized society, then our third nature consists of a conscious reflection on these habits, in which we evaluate which aspects of a culture's norms are worth adhering to and which have outlived their usefulness. Centuries ago our ancestors may have had to squelch all signs of spontaneity and individuality in order to civilize themselves, but now that norms of nonviolence are entrenched, we can let up on particular inhibitions that may be obsolete. In this way of thinking, the fact that women show a lot of skin or that men curse in public is not a sign of cultural decay. On the contrary, it's a sign that they live in a society that is so civilized that they don't have to fear being harassed or assaulted in response. As the novelist Robert Howard put it, "Civilized men are more discourteous than savages because they know they can be impolite without having their skulls split." Maybe the time has even come when I can use a knife to push peas onto my fork.</div>
