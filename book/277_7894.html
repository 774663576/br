<div class="line_en">"Ah! I know nothing about the feelings of parents," said the Water-rat; "I am not a family man. In fact, I have never been married, and I never intend to be.

<div class="line_en">One morning the old Water-rat put his head out of his hole. He had bright beady eyes and stiff grey whiskers, and his tail was like a long bit of black india-rubber.

<div class="line_en">"You will never be in the best society unless you can stand on your heads," she kept saying to them; and every now and then she showed them how it was done.

<div class="line_cn" title="“除非你们学会倒立，否则你们永远不会进入上流社会，”她老爱这么对他们说，并不停地做给他们看。但是小鸭子们并未对她的话引起重视。他们太年轻了，一点也不知道在上流社会的好处是什么。">查看中文翻译</div>

Indeed, so devoted was the rich Miller to little Hans, that he [Hans] would never go by his garden without leaning over the wall and plucking a large nosegay, or a handful of sweet herbs, or filling his pockets with plums and cherries if it was the fruit season.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“小汉斯有许多朋友，但是最忠实的朋友只有磨坊主大休。的确，有钱的磨坊主对小汉斯是非常忠实的，每次他从小汉斯的花园经过总要从围墙上俯过身去摘上一大束鲜花，或者摘上一把香草。遇到硕果累累的季节，他就会往口袋里装满李子和樱桃。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No," answered the Linnet, "I don't think he was distinguished at all, except for his kind heart, and his funny round good-humoured face. He lived in a tiny cottage all by himself, and every day he worked in his garden. In all the country-side there was no garden so lovely as his. Sweet-william grew there, and Gilly-flowers, and Shepherds' -- purses, and Fair-maids of France. There were damask Roses, and yellow Roses, lilac Crocuses, and gold, purple Violets and white. Columbine and Ladysmock, Marjoram and Wild Basil, the Cowslip and the Flower-de-luce, the Daffodil and the Clove-Pink bloomed or blossomed in their proper order as the months went by, one flower taking another flower's place, so that there were always beautiful things to look at, and pleasant odours to smell.</div>

That at least is my idea about friendship, and I am sure I am right. So I shall wait till the spring comes, and then I shall pay him a visit, and he will be able to give me a large basket of primroses, and that will make him so happy.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“磨坊主常常对自己的妻子说，‘只要雪没有停，就没有必要去看小汉斯，因为人在困难的时候，就应该让他们独处，不要让外人去打搅他们。这至少是我对友谊的看法，我相信自己是对的，所以我要等到春天到来，那时我会去看望他，他还会送我一大篮樱草，这会使他非常愉快的。’">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"So little Hans worked away in his garden. During the spring, the summer, and the autumn he was very happy, but when the winter came, and he had no fruit or flowers to bring to the market, he suffered a good deal from cold and hunger, and often had to go to bed without any supper but a few dried pears or some hard nuts. Jn the winter, also, he was extremely lonely, as the Miller never came to see him then.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Sometimes, indeed, the neighbours thought it strange that the rich Miller never gave little Hans anything in return, though he had a hundred sacks of flour stored away in his mill, and six milk cows, and a large stock of woolly sheep; but Hans never troubled his head about these things, and nothing gave him greater pleasure than to listen to all the wonderful things the Miller used to say about the unselfishness of true friendship.</div>

Why, if little Hans came up here, and saw our warm fire, and our good supper, and our great cask of red wine, he might get envious, and envy is a most terrible thing, and would spoil anybody's nature. I certainly will not allow Hans's nature to be spoiled. I am his best friend, and I will always watch over him, and see that he is not led into any temptations. Besides, if Hans came here, he might ask me to let him have some flour on credit, and that I could not do. Flour is one thing, and friendship is another, and they should not be confused. Why, the words are spelt differently, and mean quite different things. Everybody can see that.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“‘你真是个傻孩子！’磨坊主大声渠道，‘我真不知道送你上学有什么用处。你好像什么也没有学会。噢，假如小汉斯来这里的话，看见我们暖和的炉火，看见我们丰盛的晚餐，以及大桶的红酒，他可能会妒忌的，而妒忌是一件非常可怕的事情，它会毁了一个人的品性。我当然不愿意把小汉斯的品性给毁了，我是他最要好的朋友，我要一直照顾他，并留心他不受任何诱惑的欺骗。再说，如果小汉斯来到我家，他也许会要我赊点面粉给他，这我可办不到。面粉是一件事，友谊又是另一件事，两者不能混为一谈。对呀，这两个词拼写起来差别很大，意思也大不一样。每个人都清楚这一点。’">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"'You are certainly very thoughtful about others,' answered the Wife, as she sat in her comfortable armchair by the big pinewood fire; 'very thoughtful indeed.

<div class="line_en">"Then you are quite behind the age," said the Water-rat. "Every good story-teller nowadays starts with the end, and then goes on to the beginning, and concludes with the middle. That is the new method. I heard all about it the other day from a critic who was walking round the pond with a young man. He spoke of the matter at great length, and I am sure he must have been right, for he had blue spectacles and a bald head, and whenever the young man made any remark, he always answered "Pooh!" But pray go on with your story. I like the Miller immensely. I have all kinds of beautiful sentiments myself, so there is a great sympathy between us.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那么你就太落后了，”河鼠说，“当今那些故事高手们都是从结尾讲起，然后到开头，最后才讲到中间。这是新方法。这些话是我那天从一位评论家那儿听来的，当时他正同一位年轻人在池塘边散步。对这个问题他作了好一番高谈阔论，我相信他是正确的，因他戴着一副蓝色的眼镜，头也全秃了，而且只要年轻人一开口讲话，他就总回答说，‘呸！’不过，还是请你把故事讲下去吧。我尤其喜欢那个磨坊主。我自己也有各种美丽的情感，所以我与他是同病相怜。”">查看中文翻译</div>
