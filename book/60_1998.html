<div class="line_en">They went from one to the next, but the doors were all closed. No admittance. At last they found one that was open, with a set of movable stairs leading up to it. They climbed the stairs and were greeted by a steward at the door. It was a small airplane -- one that sat barely thirty passengers -- and completely empty. They walked down the aisle between the seats, holding on to each other and not paying much attention to their surroundings. They took two adjoining seats, and Tereza laid her head on Tomas's shoulder. The first wave of horror had passed and been replaced by sadness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们从一架飞机走到另一架飞机，可是所有飞机的机舱门都关着，进不去。最后他们终于找到了一架前舱门开着的飞机，舷梯已经架好。他们走上舷梯，一位乘务员出现在机舱的门口，示意他俩往里走。这是一架小型飞机，只有三十来个座位，舱内一个乘客也没有。他们在座位之间的过道上向前走去，始终相互依偎着，也不管周围发生了什么。他们找到两个位子并肩坐下，特蕾莎把头靠在托马斯的肩上。最初的恐惧感消失了，变成了忧虑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Without turning his head, Tomas picked up the letter and handed it to her. It said that he was obliged to report that day to the airfield of the neighboring town.</div>

<div class="line_en">On that day, however, she gave a start. Tomas was not reading a book; he had a letter in front of him, and even though it consisted of no more than five typed lines, Tomas was staring at it long and hard.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可这天，特蕾莎贴近他时，发现托马斯并不是在看书。他面前放着一封信，尽管只有四五行用打字机打的字，可托马斯却眼睛一眨不眨地在死盯着看。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">While reading the letter, Tereza did not feel any love for Tomas; she simply realized that she could not now leave him for an instant: the feeling of horror overwhelmed all other emotions and instincts. Now that she was leaning against him (as the plane sailed through the storm clouds), her fear subsided and she became aware of her love, a love that she knew had no limit or bounds.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特蕾莎读完信的一刹那，并没有对托马斯产生什么爱，因为恐惧感抑制了所有其他的感情和感觉，她只是觉得自己一刻也不应该离开他。此刻，她依偎着托马斯（飞机在云层中穿行），恐惧消失了，她感到了自己的爱，而且她知道这是一种无限的爱，无比的爱。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">All we can see is the piercing light of an unknown event awaiting us. Sadness, on the other hand, assumes we are in the know. Tomas and Tereza knew what was awaiting them. The light of horror thus lost its harshness, and the world was bathed in a gentle, bluish light that actually beautified it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看见的，只是所期待的未知事件的一束强光。忧虑则相反，它意味着我们是有所知的。托马斯和特蕾莎知道等待他们的是什么。恐惧之强光被蒙上了，于是我们发现世界沐浴在淡蓝色的、温柔的光线中，使从前最丑陋的事物变得再也美丽不过。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Horror is a shock, a time of utter blindness. Horror lacks every hint of beauty.</div>

<div class="line_en">At last the airplane landed. They stood up and went to the door, which the steward opened for them. Still holding each other around the waist, they stood at the top of the stairs. Down below they saw three men with hoods over their heads and rifles in their hands. There was no point in stalling, because there was no escape. They descended slowly, and when their feet reached the ground of the airfield, one of the men raised his rifle and aimed it at them. Although no shot rang out, Tereza felt Tomas -- who a second before had been leaning against her, his arm around her waist -- crumple to the ground.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="飞机终于降落了。乘务员打开机舱门，他们站起身，朝舱门走去。他们始终相互搂着，站在舷梯高高的台阶上。只见下面有三个戴着风帽、持枪的男人。犹豫已没有用，因为没有办法再逃。他们慢慢走下舷梯，脚刚落到地上，其中一个男人举枪瞄准。没有听见枪声，可是特蕾莎发现刚刚还在身边、搂着她的托马斯，松开了手，往地上倒去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then he turned and set off after the little object, which was darting here and there as if trying desperately to dodge someone and find shelter. The chase went on for a while, until suddenly the man hurled himself to the ground. The chase was over.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着，他转过身，奋不顾身地去追捕那个小东西，只见它呈之字形飞奔着，像是在躲避某人，拼命寻找一个藏身处。追捕持续了几分钟，后来，那男人猛地扑倒在地，追捕宣告结束。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She tried pressing him to her but could not hold him up, and he fell against the cement runway. She leaned over him, about to fling herself on him, cover him with her body, when suddenly she noticed something strange: his body was quickly shrinking before her eyes. She was so shocked that she froze and stood stock still. The more Tomas's body shrank, the less it resembled him, until it turned into a tiny little object that started moving, running, dashing across the airfield.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她想把他抱住，可怎么也支撑不住他。他跌倒在降落场的水泥跑道上。特蕾莎弯下腰，试图扑向托马斯，用自己的身体护着他，可就在这时，发生了一件奇怪的事：眼前，托马斯的身体开始缩小，在迅速缩小。这真是难以置信，特蕾莎惊呆了，一动不动地站在那儿。托马斯的身体变得越来越小，一点儿都不像他了，最后只剩下一个很小的东西，它开始移动，然后跑了起来，在机场上奔逃。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The man who had shot him took off his mask and gave Tereza a pleasant smile.</div>

<div class="line_en">The man stood up and went back to Tereza, carrying the object in his hand. It was quaking with fear. It was a rabbit. He handed it to Tereza. At that instant her fear and sadness subsided and she was happy to be holding an animal in her arms, happy that the animal was hers and she could press it to her body. She burst into tears of joy. She wept, wept until blinded by her tears, and took the rabbit home with the feeling that she was nearly at her goal, the place where she wanted to be and would never forsake.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他站起来，朝特蕾莎走来。他捧着那东西给特蕾莎看。小东西吓得颤抖着。这是一只野兔，那男人将它递给特蕾莎。于是，恐惧和忧虑都消失了，她快乐地抱着这个小动物，一个属于她、她可以搂在怀里的小动物。她幸福地流下了泪。她哭了，不停地哭着，泪水挡住了她的视线，她将小兔子带回家中，心想：总算快达到目的了，她已到达自己想去的地方，她不必再逃跑了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It had a bed, a table, and a chair. The table had a lamp on it, a lamp that had never stopped burning in anticipation of her return, and on the lamp perched a butterfly with two large eyes painted on its widespread wings. Tereza knew she was at her goal. She lay down on the bed and pressed the rabbit to her face.</div>

<div class="line_en">Wandering the streets of Prague, she had no trouble finding her house, the house where she had lived with Mama and Papa as a small girl. But Mama and Papa were gone. She was greeted by two old people she had never seen before, but whom she knew to be her great-grandfather and great-grandmother. They both had faces as wrinkled as the bark of a tree, and Tereza was happy she would be living with them. But for now, she wanted to be alone with her animal. She immediately found the room she had been given at the age of five, when her parents decided she deserved her own living space.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她踏上了去布拉格的路，并在街上轻而易举就找到了自己的家。她小时候和父母曾在那儿生活过。她的父母现已不住那儿了。两个老人接待了她，她从未见过他们，但她知道这是她的曾祖父和曾祖母。他们的脸老得像褶皱的树皮，特蕾莎很高兴与他们共同生活。不过眼下，她想独自和小动物呆在一起。她毫不费劲就找到了幼时的小屋，她五岁起就住在那里，当时她的父母认为她应该有一个属于自己的房间。">查看中文翻译</div>
