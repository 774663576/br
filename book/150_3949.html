<div class="line_en">One day passed after the other. The sights of the wayside served as a background to her thoughts. She saw them as it were in duplicate, rounded as though in a stereoscope, with an added significance because to everything she saw was added the recollection of what she had seen when but a few short weeks before she had taken the same journey in the contrary direction. The coolies with their loads straggled disorderly, two or three together, and then a hundred yards behind one by himself, and then two or three more; the soldiers of the escort shuffled along with a clumsy walk that covered five and twenty miles a day; the amah was carried by two bearers and Kitty, not because she was heavier, but for face' sake, by four. Now and then they met a string of coolies lolloping by in line with their heavy burdens, now and then a Chinese official in a sedan who looked at the white woman with inquisitive eyes; now they came across peasants in faded blue and huge hats on their way to market and now a woman, old or young, tottering along on her bound feet. They passed up and down little hills laid out with trim rice-fields and farm- houses nestling cosily in a grove of bamboos; they passed through ragged villages and populous cities walled like the cities in a missal. The sun of the early autumn was pleasant, and if at daybreak, when the shimmering dawn lent the neat fields the enchantment of a fairy tale, it was cold, the warmth later was very grateful. Kitty was filled by it with a sense of beatitude which she made no effort to resist.</div>

<div class="line_en">Waddington walked with Kitty up the hill and they turned aside for a moment to look at Walter's grave; at the memorial arch he said good-bye to her, and looking at it for the last time she felt that she could reply to the enigmatic irony of its appearance with an equal irony of her own. She stepped into her chair.</div>

<div class="line_en">The vivid scenes with their elegant colour, their unexpected distinction, and their strangeness, were like an arras before which, like mysterious, shadowy shapes, played the phantoms of Kitty's fancy. They seemed wholly unreal. Mei-Tan-Fu with its crenellated walls was like the painted canvas placed on the stage in an old play to represent a city. The nuns, Waddington, and the Manchu woman who loved him, were fantastic characters in a masque; and the rest, the people sidling along the tortuous streets and those who died, were nameless supers. Of course it had, they all had, a significance of some sort, but what was it? It was as though they performed a ritual dance, elaborate and ancient, and you knew that those complicated measures had a meaning which it was important for you to know; and yet you could see no clue, no clue.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="眼前的风景色彩明丽，各具特色，时常给人意外，宛如是一沓异常华丽的花毯。而在花毯上，凯蒂的思绪像神秘而黯淡的影子一样晃来晃去。记忆中的一切似乎都不是真实的了。湄潭府的垛墙像是一出古剧的舞台上代指为某座城市的画布。嬷嬷们，韦丁顿，还有爱他的满洲女人，活像一出假面舞会上别出心裁装扮出来的人物。而其他的人——弯弯曲曲的街道上闲逛的人们和那些死去的人，仅仅是舞台上的无名走卒。当然所有人的身上都具有某种特别的意义，然而到底是什么呢？他们就好像是一场古老的宗教仪式上的舞者，你知道那些随着复杂节奏舞动的肢体具有某种你必须明白的意义，可你就是抓不着一点头绪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It seemed incredible to Kitty (an old woman was passing along the causeway, in blue, and the blue in the sunshine was like lapis lazuli; her face with its thousand little wrinkles was like a mask of old ivory; and she leaned, as she walked on her tiny feet, on a long black staff) it seemed incredible to Kitty that she and Walter had taken part in that strange and unreal dance. They had played important parts too. She might easily have lost her life: he had. Was it a joke? Perhaps it was nothing but a dream from which she would suddenly awake with a sigh of relief. It seemed to have taken place a long time ago and in a far-off place. It was singular how shadowy the persons of that play seemed against the sunny background of real life. And now it seemed to Kitty like a story that she was reading; it was a little startling that it seemed to concern her so little. She found already that she could not recall with distinctness Waddington's face which had been so familiar to her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯蒂难以相信（一个老妪沿着堤道走过来，身上穿着蓝布的衣服，在阳光下呈现出天青石的颜色。她的脸上遍布皱纹，活像一个老旧的象牙面具。她弯着腰，挪着小脚，手里拄着一根长长的黑色拐杖），凯蒂难以相信她和瓦尔特曾经参加了这样一场奇异而虚幻的舞会，还在其中扮演了如此重要的角色。她可能轻易地就丢了性命，他不就丢了吗？这会不会是一个玩笑？或许这只是一个梦，她应该立即惊醒，然后如释重负地长叹一声。转眼之间，这一切就好似发生在十分久远的时候，发生在一个遥不可及的地方了。在阳光明媚的现实之前，这出遥远的戏剧里的角色们该是多么模糊难辨。凯蒂觉得这出戏只是她读的一本小说，书里描述的故事似乎跟她毫不相干，这几乎吓了她一跳。她已经想不起韦丁顿那张脸到底长得什么模样了，而不久之前她还是如此地熟悉。">查看中文翻译</div>
