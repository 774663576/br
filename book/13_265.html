When Aragorn comes into his own, I shall offer him the service of stonewrights of the Mountain, and we will make this a town to be proud of."</div>

<div class="line_en">At length they came to the Prince Imrahil, and Legolas looked at him and bowed low; for he saw that here indeed was one who had elven-blood in his veins. "Hail, lord!" he said.

<div class="line_cn" title="最后，他们来到了印拉希尔王面前。勒苟拉斯打量了他片刻，深深一鞠躬，因为他看出来眼前的统治者确实拥有精灵血统。“大人！”他说：“宁若戴尔的居民已经极少离开罗瑞安的森林，不过，人们还是可以发现并非每个精灵都离开了安罗斯的港岸。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">With that the servant of the Prince came and led them to the Houses of Healing; and there they found their friends in the garden, and their meeting was a merry one. For a while they walked and talked, rejoicing for a brief space in peace and rest under the morning high up in the windy circles of the City. Then when Merry became weary, they went and sat upon the wall with the greensward of the Houses of Healing behind them; and away southward before them was the Anduin glittering in the sun, as it flowed away, out of the sight even of Legolas, into the wide flats and green haze of Lebennin and South Ithilien.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，王子的仆人正好前来带领两人前往医院，他们在那边的花园里见到了朋友，久别重逢自然是很令人高兴的事。他们边走边聊，把握这难得的安祥片刻，享受园内的美景和微风。当梅里觉得有些疲倦时，他们全都在城墙上坐了下来，背后则是医院翠绿的园圃；他们的南方是艳阳下波光粼粼的安都因大河，在勒苟拉斯的眼中，他甚至可以看见兰班宁和南伊西立安的风景。">查看中文翻译</div>

Never in all my life had I met them, until we came to Pelargir, and there I heard them crying in the air as we rode to the battle of the ships. Then I stood still, forgetting war in Middle-earth; for their wailing voices spoke to me of the Sea. The Sea! Alas! I have not yet beheld it. But deep in the hearts of all my kindred lies the sea-longing, which it is perilous to stir. Alas! for the gulls. No peace shall I have again under beech or under elm."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你们看！”他大喊着：“是海鸥！没想到它们会飞到这么远的内陆来，这真是个奇景，但也让我内心有些不安。我这辈子从来没看过它们，在我们前往佩拉格之前；在那里，当我们准备登船作战时，我听到它们在空中鸣叫的声音。我当场呆立，完全忘记了中土世界的战争，因为它们的鸣叫声述说着大海的景象。大海！唉！我还没机会看看它，不过，每个精灵的心中都对大海有种向往，一被挑动起来就不可遏抑。啊！我希望自己没有看到那些海鸥，将来，光只躺在树下休息而已，将不能够满足我了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

There will always be some folk, big or little, and even a few wise dwarves like Gimli, who need you. At least I hope so. Though I feel somehow that the worst of this war is still to come. How I wish it was all over, and well over!"</div>

It was at early morn of the day ere you came there, Merry, that we left Dunharrow, and such a fear was on all the folk that none would look on our going, save the Lady Éowyn, who lies now hurt in the House below. There was grief at that parting, and I was grieved to behold it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“也包括了对他的友谊吧，”勒苟拉斯说：“每个认识他的人，都会以自己的方法来敬爱他，即使是那骠骑国冷冰冰的美女也是一样。梅里，在你来到这里的那天一早，我们离开了登哈洛，那里的居民害怕到不敢目送我们离开，只有伊欧玟例外，她现在则是在医院里面调养身体。那场分离真让人难过，连我看到都觉得很不忍心。”">查看中文翻译</div>

"Four days and nights, and on into a fifth, we rode from the Black Stone," he said. "And lo! in the darkness of Mordor my hope rose; for in that gloom the Shadow Host seemed to grow stronger and more terrible to look upon. Some I saw riding, some striding, yet all moving with the same great speed. Silent they were, but there was a gleam in their eyes. In the uplands of Lamedon they overtook our horses, and swept round us, and would have passed us by, if Aragorn had not forbidden them."</div>

But defenders and foes alike gave up the battle and fled when we came, crying out that the King of the Dead was upon them.

Lo! all the black fleet was in his hands; and he chose the greatest ship to be his own, and he went up into it.

There they stood silent, hardly to be seen, save for a red gleam in their eyes that caught the glare of the ships that were burning.

Yet for a while I stand in the place of the Steward of Gondor, and it is mine to think first of its people. To prudence some heed must still be given. For we must prepare against all chances, good as well as evil. Now, it may be that we shall triumph, and while there is any hope of this, Gondor must be protected. I would not have us return with victory to a City in ruins and a land ravaged behind us. And yet we learn from the Rohirrim that there is an army still unfought upon our northern flank."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“而我，”印拉希尔说：“亚拉冈大人是我的君王，不管他承不承认都一样，他的想法就是我的命令，我也会去。但是，我必须暂代刚铎宰相的职务，也暂时必须先以它的人民优先考量，有些事情，我还是必须谨慎一些。我们必须准备好面对所有的可能性，可能是好，可能是坏。我们最后可能还是会获胜，只要这有一丝希望，我们就必须保护刚铎的人民。如果我们凯旋归来，我可不愿见到一座废墟和被敌人蹂躏的家园。而骠骑的情报也显示，北方边境依旧还有一支部队持续威胁我们。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"All are weary, and very many have wounds light or grievous," said Éomer, "and we have suffered much loss of our horses, and that is ill to bear. If we must ride soon, then I cannot hope to lead even two thousands, and yet leave as many for the defence of the City."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们的兵马都很疲倦，许多人都挂彩了，有些甚至身受重伤，”伊欧墨说：“我们自己的马匹也死伤惨重，这点最让人担心。如果我们得赶快出发，那么我想最多也只能派出两千骑兵，另外留下两千人防守王城。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We have not only to reckon with those who fought on this field," said Aragorn. "New strength is on the way from the southern fiefs, now that the coasts have been rid. Four thousands I sent marching from Pelargir through Lossarnach two days ago; and Angbor the fearless rides before them. If we set out in two days more, they will draw nigh ere we depart. Moreover many were bidden to follow me up the River in any craft they could gather; and with this wind they will soon be at hand, indeed several ships have already come to the Harlond. I judge that we could lead out seven thousands of horse and foot, and yet leave the City in better defence than it was when the assault began."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“除了眼前的兵力之外，”亚拉冈说：“由于海岸的威胁已经解除，南方海岸也有不少生力军正在赶来的路上。两天之前我派了四千兵马从佩拉格前往罗萨那奇，无畏的安格柏带领他们。如果我们在两天之内出发，他们应该可以在我们离开之前抵达。不只如此，我还下令其他人乘坐所有可以找到的船舰沿河过来支援，以这样的风势看来，他们两天之内应该也到得了；事实上，今天已经有几艘船抵达了哈龙德。我判断到时我们可以带领七千名步兵和骑兵，同时还可以在城内留下比攻防战开始前更多的兵力。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That is true," said Gandalf. "I do not counsel you to leave the City all unmanned. Indeed the force that we lead east need not be great enough for any assault in earnest upon Mordor, so long as it be great enough to challenge battle. And it must move soon. Therefore I ask the Captains: what force could we muster and lead out in two days' time at the latest? And they must be hardy men that go willingly, knowing their peril."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“的确，”甘道夫说：“我并不建议让城中毫无防卫。事实上，我们东征的部队不需要多到足以对魔多展开攻击，只要多到无法让魔王忽视就可以了，而部队移动的速度也必须够快。容我询问各位将领，我们在最多两天的时间中可以动员多少部队？这些人必须是明知危险也愿意前去的老练战士。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"In Erebor in the Kingdom of Dáin there is such skill," said Aragorn; "and if all our hopes do not perish, then in time I will send Gimli Glóin's son to ask for wrights of the Mountain. But men are better than gates, and no gate will endure against our Enemy if men desert it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“在丹恩的国度中，依鲁伯的工匠们有这种技术，”亚拉冈说：“如果我们没有一败涂地，或许我可以派金雳去请求山中的石匠前来支援。不过，战士远胜过厚门，如果人们逃离岗位，就算再厚的门也挡不住魔王。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The Gate is destroyed," said Imrahil, "and where now is the skill to rebuild it and set it up anew?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“城门被毁了，”印拉希尔说：“我们哪有足够的技术可以将它完全修复？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This then was the end of the debate of the lords: that they should set forth on the second morning from that day with seven thousands, if these might be found; and the great part of this force should be on foot, because of the evil lands into which they would go. Aragorn should find some two thousands of those that he had gathered to him in the South; but Imrahil should find three and a half thousands; and Éomer five hundreds of the Rohirrim who were unhorsed but themselves warworthy, and he himself should lead five hundreds of his best Riders on horse; and another company of five hundred horse there should be, among which should ride the sons of Elrond with the Dúnedain and the knights of Dol Amroth: all told six thousand foot and a thousand horse. But the main strength of the Rohirrim that remained horsed and able to fight, some three thousand under the command of Elfhelm, should waylay the West Road against the enemy that was in Anórien. And at once swift riders were sent out to gather what news they could northwards; and eastwards from Osgiliath and the road to Minas Morgul.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这就是各军领袖会议的结果：如果可能的话，他们应该在后天的早晨带领七千兵马出发。由于这部队未来将会进入魔多寸草不生的大地，因此大部分的战士应该步行。亚拉冈必须召集南方来的两千名战士，印拉希尔必须派出三千五百名士兵，伊欧墨则是必须挑选五百名善于步战的洛汗战士，另外再率领五百名最精锐的骠骑。除此之外，还有五百名由安罗斯骑士和登丹人组成的骑兵，这是由爱隆的两名儿子所率领。这样加起来总共七千兵马──六千名步兵、一千名骑兵。洛汗国的主力骑兵，大约三千名的兵力，则是必须在艾海姆的带领下，沿着西大道伏击安诺瑞安的敌人；城中也同时派出快马，前往北方和东方收集情报，打探清楚奥斯吉力亚斯和米那斯魔窟的状况。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No, he will try to trap the fly and take the sting," said Gandalf. "And there are names among us that are worth more than a thousand mail-clad knights apiece. No, he will not smile."</div>

<div class="line_en">And when they had reckoned up all their strength and taken thought for the journeys they should make and the roads they should choose, Imrahil suddenly laughed aloud.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Neither shall we," said Aragorn. "If this be jest, then it is too bitter for laughter. Nay, it is the last move in a great jeopardy, and for one side or the other it will bring the end of the game." Then he drew Andúril and held it up glittering in the sun. "You shall not be sheathed again until the last battle is fought," he said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们也不该笑，”亚拉冈说：“如果这是玩笑，那它的代价也未免太沉重了。不，这是赌局中最后的孤注一掷，对于任何一方来说，都是输赢的关键。”然后，他拔出了安都瑞尔圣剑，让它在阳光下反射着璀璨的光芒，“在最后一场战争结束之前，你将陪我度过这一切！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Surely," he cried, "this is the greatest jest in all the history of Gondor: that we should ride with seven thousands, scarce as many as the vanguard of its army in the days of its power, to assail the mountains and the impenetrable gate of the Black Land! So might a child threaten a mail-clad knight with a bow of string and green willow! If the Dark Lord knows so much as you say, Mithrandir, will he not rather smile than fear, and with his little finger crush us like a fly that tries to sting him?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这实在是，”他大喊道：“这一定是刚铎历史上规模最大的玩笑：我们只率领仅仅七千兵马，而这不过是刚铎全盛时期部队前锋的数量。而我们竟然要攻打固若金汤的魔王基地！这样就好像小孩子拿着木刀木枪，威胁全副武装的骑士一样！米斯兰达，如果魔王知道的和你一样，他多半会一笑置之，用小指捏死我们这些想要刺他的蜜蜂。”">查看中文翻译</div>
