<div class="line_en">Of the works of this mind history is the record. Its genius is illustrated by the entire series of days. Man is explicable by nothing less than all his history. Without hurry, without rest, the human spirit goes forth from the beginning to embody every faculty, every thought, every emotion, which belongs to it in appropriate events. But the thought is always prior to the fact; all the facts of history preëxist in the mind as laws. Each law in turn is made by circumstances predominant, and the limits of nature give power to but one at a time. A man is the whole encyclopædia of facts. The creation of a thousand forests is in one acorn, and Egypt, Greece, Rome, Gaul, Britain, America, he folded already in the first man. Epoch after epoch, camp, kingdom, empire, republic, democracy, are merely the application of his manifold spirit to the manifold world.</div>

<div class="line_en">This human mind wrote history, and this must read it. The Sphinx must solve her own riddle. If the whole of history is in one man, it is all to be explained from individual experience. There is a relation between the hours of our life and the centuries of time. As the air I breathe is drawn from the great repositories of nature, as the light on my book is yielded by a star a hundred millions of miles distant, as the poise of my body depends on the equilibrium of centrifugal and centripetal forces, so the hours should be instructed by the ages, and the ages explained by the hours. Of the universal mind each individual man is one more incarnation. All its properties consist in him. Each new fact in his private experience flashes a light on what great bodies of men have done, and the crises of his life refer to national crises. Every revolution was first a thought in one man's mind, and when the same thought occurs to another man, it is the key to that era. Every reform was once a private opinion, and when it shall be a private opinion again, it will solve the problem of the age. The fact narrated must correspond to something in me to be credible or intelligible. We as we read must become Greeks, Romans, Turks, priest and king, martyr and executioner, must fasten these images to some reality in our secret experience, or we shall learn nothing rightly. What befell Asdrubal or Cæsar Borgia is as much an illustration of the mind's powers and depravations as what has befallen us. Each new law and political movement has meaning for you. Stand before each of its tablets and say, 'Under this mask did my Proteus nature hide itself.' This remedies the defect of our too great nearness to ourselves. This throws our actions into perspective: and as crabs, goats, scorpions, the balance, and the waterpot lose their meanness when hung as signs in the zodiac, so I can see my own vices without heat in the distant persons of Solomon, Alcibiades, and Catiline.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个人类的心灵抒写了历史，而它也必须阅读历史。司芬克斯必须解答自己的谜语。如果整部历史就包藏在一个人身上，那么我们完全可以根据个人的经验来解释历史。我们生活中的每时每刻与一个个世纪之间，存在着一种相通的联系。比如我所呼吸的空气是从大自然这个巨大的储藏室里汲取而来的，比如我书上的光来自一亿英里之外的一颗星球，我身体的平衡全靠离心力与向心力的均衡。因而一个个时刻也应受到时代的导引，一个个时代也可以由时刻来解释。每一个人都是共同心灵的又一次转世再现，共同心灵的所有特点都体现在他的内心。他个人经验里的每一件新的事实都反映出绝大多数人曾共同做过什么，他私人生活的危机也反映了民族的生死存亡的危机。每一场革命起初只是某个人脑子里的一个念头，而当另一个人脑海里也出现了同样一种思想时，它就成为了那个时代的一个关键。每一次改革最初都是一种个人的看法，而当它再次成为一种个人看法时，它将成为解决那个时代的问题的答案了。你所描述的事实必须与我的内心一致，我才会认为它是可信的，可理解的。当我们阅读时，我们必须成为古希腊人、古罗马人、土耳其人、牧师与国王、殉教者与刽子手；我们必须把这些形象同我们隐秘经验里的某种实物紧密联系起来，否则我们就不能正确地掌握任何知识。发生在阿斯德鲁贝尔和凯撒身上的一切，就是关于心灵的力量和堕落的最好证明。每一种新的法律与政治运动对你来说都是有意义的。站在它的每一个招牌前，你应该说：“在这面具之下，曾掩藏了我多变的心灵本性。”这弥补了我们离自己太近的这个毛病。这使我们能透过一定的比例观看我们自己的行为。螃蟹、山羊、蝎子、秤与水壶一旦被用作黄道十二宫的标志，就不再是微不足道的东西了；同样地，在所罗门、亚西比德和喀提休这些遥远的人物身上，我也能够冷静地看到我自身的罪恶。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It is the universal nature which gives worth to particular men and things. Human life as containing this is mysterious and inviolable, and we hedge it round with penalties and laws. All laws derive hence their ultimate reason; all express more or less distinctly some command of this supreme, illimitable essence. Property also holds of the soul, covers great spiritual facts, and instinctively we at first hold to it with swords and laws, and wide and complex combinations. The obscure consciousness of this fact is the light of all our day, the claim of claims; the plea for education, for justice, for charity, the foundation of friendship and love, and of the heroism and grandeur which belong to acts of self-reliance. It is remarkable that involuntarily we always read as superior beings. Universal history, the poets, the romancers, do not in their stateliest pictures -- in the sacerdotal, the imperial palaces, in the triumphs of will or of genius -- anywhere lose our ear, anywhere make us feel that we intrude, that this is for better men; but rather is it true, that in their grandest strokes we feel most at home. All that Shakspeare says of the king, yonder slip of a boy that reads in the corner feels to be true of himself. We sympathize in the great moments of history, in the great discoveries, the great resistances, the great prosperities of men; -- because there law was enacted, the sea was searched, the land was found, or the blow was struck for us, as we ourselves in that place would have done or applauded.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="普遍的天性使特殊的人和事物也有了价值。包含着这种普遍天性的生命是神秘的，是神圣不可侵犯的，我们用各种惩戒和法律来维护它。因而，一切法律都从中获得了自己最终存在的理由；一切法律都或多或少地明确表示它们掌握着这种最高无限的要素。财产也控制着灵魂，包含着伟大的精神实质；起初，我们本能地用武力与法律，以及广泛而复杂的工具来掌控它。我们隐约意识到，这一事实就是我们这一生一世的光明，是我们最高的要求，是我们对教育、正义、仁慈的呼唤，是友谊、爱情、自助的基础。值得提醒的是，我们在阅读时，总是情不自禁地把自己看作超人。宇宙的历史，诗人，传奇作家，他们所描绘的最辉煌的画面——祭司和帝王的宫殿，坚强的意志和天才的胜利——从来不会让我们失望，不让我们感觉到这是在侵入别人的领地，不让我们感觉到这是要给更优秀的人看的；倒是在他们最伟大的笔法里，我们觉得轻松自如。莎士比亚述说的关于国王的一切，连坐在角落里读书的孩子也觉得可以发生在自己身上。历史的每一个伟大时刻，伟大发明，伟大抵抗，都能唤起我们的同情——因为自会有人为我们制定法律，为我们去海上探险，为我们发现陆地，或是为我们打击敌人，而如果我们处在同样位置也会这样做，或是鼓掌欢呼别人这样做。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We have the same interest in condition and character. We honor the rich, because they have externally the freedom, power, and grace which we feel to be proper to man, proper to us. So all that is said of the wise man by Stoic, or oriental or modern essayist, describes to each reader his own idea, describes his unattained but attainable self. All literature writes the character of the wise man. Books, monuments, pictures, conversation, are portraits in which he finds the lineaments he is forming. The silent and the eloquent praise him and accost him, and he is stimulated wherever he moves as by personal allusions. A true aspirant, therefore, never needs look for allusions personal and laudatory in discourse. He hears the commendation, not of himself, but more sweet, of that character he seeks, in every word that is said concerning character, yea, further, in every fact and circumstance, -- in the running river and the rustling com. Praise is looked, homage tendered, love flows from mute nature, from the mountains and the lights of the firmament.</div>

<div class="line_en">The world exists for the education of each man. There is no age or state of society or mode of action in history, to which there is not somewhat corresponding in his life. Every thing tends in a wonderful manner to abbreviate itself and yield its own virtue to him. He should see that he can live all history in his own person. He must sit solidly at home, and not suffer himself to be bullied by kings or empires, but know that he is greater than all the geography and all the government of the world; he must transfer the point of view from which history is commonly read, from Rome and Athens and London to himself, and not deny his conviction that he is the court, and if England or Egypt have any thing to say to him, he will try the case; if not, let them for ever be silent. He must attain and maintain that lofty sight where facts yield their secret sense, and poetry and annals are alike. The instinct of the mind, the purpose of nature, betrays itself in the use we make of the signal narrations of history. Time dissipates to shining ether the solid angularity of facts. No anchor, no cable, no fences, avail to keep a fact a fact. Babylon, Troy, Tyre, Palestine, and even early Rome, are passing already into fiction. The Garden of Eden, the sun standing still in Gibeon, is poetry thenceforward to all nations. Who cares what the fact was, when we have made a constellation of it to hang in heaven an immortal sign? London and Paris and New York must go the same way. "What is History," said Napoleon, "but a fable agreed upon?" This life of ours is stuck round with Egypt, Greece, Gaul, England, War, Colonization, Church, Court, and Commerce, as with so many flowers and wild ornaments grave and gay. I will not make more account of them. I believe in Eternity. I can find Greece, Asia, Italy, Spain, and the Islands, -- the genius and creative principle of each and of all eras in my own mind.</div>

<div class="line_en">These hints, dropped as it were from sleep and night, let us use in broad day. The student is to read history actively and not passively; to esteem his own life the text, and books the commentary. Thus compelled, the Muse of history will utter oracles, as never to those who do not respect themselves. I have no expectation that any man will read hìstory aright, who thinks that what was done in a remote age, by men whose names have resounded far, has any deeper sense than what he is doing to-day.</div>

<div class="line_en">History must be this or it is nothing. Every law which the state enacts indicates a fact in human nature; that is all. We must in ourselves see the necessary reason of every fact, -- see how it could and must be. So stand before every public and private work; before an oration of Burke, before a victory of Napoleon, before a martyrdom of Sir Thomas More, of Sidney, of Marmaduke Robinson, before a French Reign of Terror, and a Salem hanging of witches, before a fanatic Revival, and the Animal Magnetism in Paris, or in Providence. We assume that we under like influence should be alike affected, and should achieve the like; and we aim to master intellectually the steps, and reach the same height or the same degradation, that our fellow, our proxy, has done.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="历史必须是这样的，否则它就毫无价值。国家制定的每一条法律，都指出人性中的一件事实，不过如此。我们必须透彻地看出每一件事实的必要的理由——看出它能够怎样，必须怎样。你应该以这种态度对待每一种行为；对待一个政论家的演说，一个军事家的胜利，一个为主义或宗教殉难者的精神；对待革命期间的恐怖，宗教复兴的狂热。我们假定我们在同样的影响下也会受到同样的感染，做出同样的事情；我们的目的是要在精神上谙熟每一个阶段，达到我们的伙伴（也是我们的替身）所达到的同一个崇高或堕落的阶段。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We are always coming up with the emphatic facts of history in our private experience, and verifying them here. All history becomes subjective; in other words, there is properly no history; only biography. Every mind must know the whole lesson for itself, -- must go over the whole ground. What it does not see, what it does not live, it will not know. What the former age has epitomized into a formula or rule for manipular convenience, it will lose all the good of verifying for itself, by means of the wall of that rule. Somewhere, sometime, it will demand and find compensation for that loss by doing the work itself. Ferguson discovered many things in astronomy which had long been known. The better for him.</div>

But we apply ourselves to the history of its production. We put ourselves into the place and state of the builder. We remember the forest-dwellers, the first temples, the adherence to the first type, and the decoration of it as the wealth of the nation increased; the value which is given to wood by carving led to the carving over the whole mountain of stone of a cathedral. When we have gone through this process, and added thereto the Catholic Church, its cross, its music, its processions, its Saints' days and image-worship, we have, as it were, been the man that made the minster; we have seen how it could and must be.

When he has satisfied himself, in general and in detail, that it was made by such a person as he, so armed and so motived, and to ends to which he himself should also have worked, the problem is solved; his thought lives along the whole line of temples and sphinxes and catacombs, passes through them all with satisfaction, and they live again to the mind, or are now.</div>

<div class="line_en">Upborne and surrounded as we are by this all-creating nature, soft and fluid as a cloud or the air, why should we be such hard pedants, and magnify a few forms? Why should we make account of time, or of magnitude, or of figure? The soul knows them not, and genius, obeying its law, knows how to play with them as a young child plays with graybeards and in churches. Genius studies the causal thought, and, far back in the womb of things, sees the rays parting from one orb, that diverge ere they fall by infinite diameters. Genius watches the monad through all his masks as he performs the metempsychosis of nature. Genius detects through the fly, through the caterpillar, through the grub, through the egg, the constant individual; through countless individuals, the fixed species; through many species, the genus; through all genera, the steadfast type; through all the kingdoms of organized life, the eternal unity. Nature is a mutable cloud, which is always and never the same. She casts the same thought into troops of forms, as a poet makes twenty fables with one moral. Through the bruteness and toughness of matter, a subtle spirit bends all things to its own will. The adamant streams into soft but precise form before it, and, whilst I look at it, its outline and texture are changed again. Nothing is so fleeting as form; yet never does it quite deny itself. In man we still trace the remains or hints of all that we esteem badges of servitude in the lower races; yet in him they enhance his nobleness and grace; as lo, in alt schylus, transformed to a cow, offends the imagination; but how changed, when as Isis in Egypt she meets Osiris-Jove, a beautiful woman, with nothing of the metamorphosis left but the lunar horns as the splendid ornament of her brows!</div>

<div class="line_en">The identity of history is equally intrinsic, the diversity equally obvious. There is at the surface infinite variety of things; at the centre there is simplicity of cause. How many are the acts of one man in which we recognize the same character! Observe the sources of our information in respect to the Greek genius. We have the civil history of that people, as Herodotus, Thucydides, Xenophon, and Plutarch have given it; a very sufficient account of what manner of persons they were, and what they did. We have the same national mind expressed for us again in their literature, in epic and lyric poems, drama, and philosophy; a very complete form. Then we have it once more in their architecture, a beauty as of temperance itself, limited to the straight line and the square, -- a builded geometry. Then we have it once again in sculpture, the "tongue on the balance of expression," a multitude of forms in the utmost freedom of action, and never transgressing the ideal serenity; like votaries performing some religious dance before the gods, and, though in convulsive pain or mortal combat, never daring to break the figure and decorum of their dance. Thus, of the genius of one remarkable people, we have a fourfold representation: and to the senses what more unlike than an ode of Pindar, a marble centaur, the peristyle of the Parthenon, and the last actions of Phocion?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="历史的同一性都是内在的，而多样性则是外在的。事物的表面多种多样，而其核心的原因则很简单。一个人的所作所为是多么丰富啊，可我们从中看到的只是同一种性格！观察一下有关希腊天才的信息来源吧。我们所拥有的那个民族的文明史，正如希罗多德、修昔底德斯、色诺芬和普鲁塔克所记载的那样，充分阐释了他们的行为举止和所作所为。而在他们的文学、史诗、抒情诗、戏剧以及哲学这一系列蔚为大观的形式里，我们又一次看到了同一种民族精神的表现。随后在他们的建筑里，我们再一次看到了这种精神。它本身就是一种适度的美，局限于直线和方块，是一种造型的几何图形。随后又发现它表现在雕刻作品中，那是“表现均衡的语言”，其形式的多姿多彩表现为动作潇洒恣肆，而又绝不悖离理想的宁静，就像信徒们在诸神面前表演某种宗教舞蹈一样，尽管痉挛地疼痛，垂死地挣扎，却绝不会破坏舞蹈的造型与风雅。这样，有关这个非凡民族的天才，我们就有了四重表述：对于感觉来说，还有什么比一首品达的颂诗，一尊大理石的半人半马怪，一座帕台农神庙的廊柱以及福基翁临终的动作更大不一样的呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Nature is full of a sublime family likeness throughout her works; and delights in startling us with resemblances in the most unexpected quarters. I have seen the head of an old sachem of the forest, which at once reminded the eye of a bald mountain summit, and the furrows of the brow suggested the strata of the rock. There are men whose manners have the same essential splendor as the simple and awful sculpture on the friezes of the Parthenon, and the remains of the earliest Greek art. And there are compositions of the same strain to be found in the books of all ages. What is Guido's Rospigliosi Aurora but a morning thought, as the horses in it are only a morning cloud. If any one will but take pains to observe the variety of actions to which he is equally inclined in certain moods of mind, and those to which he is averse, he will see how deep is the chain of affinity.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大自然一切的作品都像一家人一样，有一种崇高的相像之点；大自然最喜欢在人最想不到的地方，给出让我们大吃一惊的相像。我曾见过深林中一个老酋长的头，它使我立刻想起一座光秃秃的山峰，其额头上的皱纹则使人想到岩石的地层。有些人的举止里天生具有一种庄严与华美，就像帕台农神庙里的那些简单而使人敬畏的雕刻，以及最早的古希腊艺术的遗迹那样的庄严与华美。在所有时代的书籍里，我们都可以找到具有同一种格调的作品。圭多在罗马罗斯匹格里奥斯宫壁上画的《曙光女神》只是描绘了一个早晨的思想，正如画中的马匹只不过是早晨的一朵云。如果有人愿意不怕麻烦地去观察他，在某些心境中他想做的各种各样的动作，以及他不想做的各种各样的动作，那就可以看出其中相似的链条是多么紧密了。">查看中文翻译</div>

A particular picture or copy of verses, if it do not awaken the same train of images, will yet superinduce the same sentiment as some wild mountain walk, although the resemblance is nowise obvious to the senses, but is occult and out of the reach of the understanding. Nature is an endless combination and repetition of a very few laws. She hums the old well-known air through innumerable variations.</div>

<div class="line_en">It has been said, that "common souls pay with what they do; nobler souls with that which they are." And why?

<div class="line_en">A painter told me that nobody could draw a tree without in some sort becoming a tree; or draw a child by studying the outlines of its form merely, -- but, by watching for a time his motions and plays, the painter enters into his nature, and can then draw him at will in every attitude. So Roos "entered into the inmost nature of a sheep." I knew a draughtsman employed in a public survey, who found that he could not sketch the rocks until their geological structure was first explained to him. In a certain state of thought is the common origin of very diverse works. It is the spirit and not the fact that is identical. By a deeper apprehension, and not primarily by a painful acquisition of many manual skills, the artist attains the power of awakening other souls to a given activity.</div>

A lady, with whom I was riding in the forest, said to me, that the woods always seemed to her to wait, as if the genii who inhabit them suspended their deeds until the wayfarer has passed onward: a thought which poetry has celebrated in the dance of the fairies, which breaks off on the approach of human feet. The man who has seen the rising moon break out of the clouds at midnight has been present like an archangel at the creation of light and of the world. I remember one summer day, in the fields, my companion pointed out to me a broad cloud, which might extend a quarter of a mile parallel to the horizon, quite accurately in the form of a cherub as painted over churches, -- a round block in the centre, which it was easy to animate with eyes and mouth, supported on either side by wide-stretched symmetrical wings. What appears once in the atmosphere may appear often, and it was undoubtedly the archetype of that familiar ornament. I have seen in the sky a chain of summer lightning which at once showed to me that the Greeks drew from nature when they painted the thunderbolt in the hand of Jove. I have seen a snow-drift along the sides of the stone wall which obviously gave the idea of the common architectural scroll to abut a tower.</div>

<div class="line_en">By surrounding ourselves with the original circumstances, we invent anew the orders and the ornaments of architecture, as we see how each people merely decorated its primitive abodes. The Doric temple preserves the semblance of the wooden cabin in which the Dorian dwelt. The Chinese pagoda is plainly a Tartar tent. The Indian and Egyptian temples still betray the mounds and subterranean houses of their forefathers. "The custom of making houses and tombs in the living rock," says Heeren, in his Researches on the Ethiopians, "determined very naturally the principal character of the Nubian Egyptian architecture to the colossal form which it assumed. In these caverns, already prepared by nature, the eve was accustomed to dwell on huge shapes and masses, so that, when art came to the assistance of nature, it could not move on a small scale without degrading itself. What would statues of the usual size, or neat porches and wings, have been, associated with those gigantic halls before which only Colossi could sit as watchmen, or lean on the pillars of the interior?"</div>

<div class="line_en">The Gothic church plainly originated in a rude adaptation of the forest trees with all their boughs to a festal or solemn arcade, as the bands about the cleft pillars still indicate the green withes that tied them. No one can walk in a road cut through pine woods, without being struck with the architectural appearance of the grove, especially in winter, when the bareness of all other trees shows the low arch of the Saxons. In the woods in a winter afternoon one will see as readily the origin of the stained glass window, with which the Gothic cathedrals are adorned, in the colors of the western sky seen through the bare and crossing branches of the forest. Nor can any lover of nature enter the old piles of Oxford and the English cathedrals, without feeling that the forest overpowered the mind of the builder, and that his chisel, his saw, and plane still reproduced its ferns, its spikes of flowers, its locust, elm, oak, pine, fir, and spruce.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the early history of Asia and Africa, Nomadism and Agriculture are the two antagonist facts. The geography of Asia and of Africa necessitated a nomadic life. But the nomads were the terror of all those whom the soil, or the advantages of a market, had induced to build towns. Agriculture, therefore, was a religious injunction, because of the perils of the state from nomadism. And in these late and civil countries of England and America, these propensities still fight out the old battle in the nation and in the individual. The nomads of Africa were constrained to wander by the attacks of the gad-fly, which drives the cattle mad, and so compels the tribe to emigrate in the rainy season, and to drive off the cattle to the higher sandy regions. The nomads of Asia follow the pasturage from month to month. In America and Europe, the nomadism is of trade and curiosity; a progress, certainly, from the gad-fly of Astaboras to the Anglo and Italo-mania of Boston Bay. Sacred cities, to which a periodical religious pilgrimage was enjoined, or stringent laws and customs, tending to invigorate the national bond, were the check on the old rovers; and the cumulative values of long residence are the restraints on the itineracy of the present day. The antagonism of the two tendencies is not less active in individuals, as the love of adventure or the love of repose happens to predominate. A man of rude health and flowing spirits has the faculty of rapid domestication, lives in his wagon, and roams through all latitudes as easily as a Calmuc. At sea, or in the forest, or in the snow, he sleeps as warm, dines with as good appetite, and associates as happily, as beside his own chimneys. Or perhaps his facility is deeper seated, in the increased range of his faculties of observation, which yield him points of interest wherever fresh objects meet his eyes. The pastoral nations were needy and hungry to desperation; and this intellectual nomadism, in its excess, bankrupts the mind, through the dissipation of power on a miscellany of objects. The home-keeping wit, on the other hand, is that continence or content which finds all the elements of life in its own soil; and which has its own perils of monotony and deterioration, if not stimulated by foreign infusions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在亚洲与非洲的早期历史里，游牧生活与农业生活是两种矛盾的生活方式。亚洲与非洲的地理特征使游牧生活成为必要的，但对那些拥有土地或市场的便利因而建造了城市的人来说，游牧民族则是非常可怕的。因为游牧生活危害了国家，所以务农就成了一种宗教性的训谕。在英国与美国这些新兴的文明国家，在国家与个人的内心，这些倾向仍像过去一样斗争着。非洲的游牧民族不得不永远流浪着，因为他们的牛群被牛虻侵袭得发狂，因而迫使那部落在雨季迁移，将牛群赶到较高的沙土区域。亚洲的游牧民族逐月跟随着有水草的地方转移。在美国与欧洲的那种游牧生活则是由于商业与好奇心；从阿斯塔波拉斯的牛虻到波士顿湾的英国迷与意大利迷，的确是一种进步。古代的流浪者受到种种限制，他们必须定期到一些圣城进行宗教朝拜，或被某些倾向于加强民族联系的严酷的法律与风俗所限制；而长期定居的累积的好处，则限制了今天人们的漫游。这两种倾向的对立在个人身上也非常活跃，是爱冒险还是爱休息，全凭当时哪一种冲动更占优势。一个体质强健，心境舒畅的人，能够很快适应环境，住在他的车里，南北畅游，到处一样地感到舒适。在海上，或是在树林里，或是在雪地里，他照样也睡得暖和，吃得有味，愉快地与人交往，就像在自己家里一样。或许他的机敏有更深的根源，他的观察范围不断增加，这使他不论看到什么新鲜事物，都能引起自己的兴趣。靠畜牧为生的国家贫困、饥饿到了绝望的地步，而这种精神上的游牧生活若发展过度，则会使人把力量分散于各种杂乱的对象上，从而毁灭了心灵。从另一方面来说，那种深居简出的聪明人的智慧只是一种自制力、一种满足，他能在自己的土地里找到生活的一切元素；但如果没有外面灌输进来的思想刺激他的智慧，它也有日趋单调与堕落的危险。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">What is the foundation of that interest all men feel in Greek history, letters, art, and poetry, in all its periods, from the Heroic or Homeric age down to the domestic life of the Athenians and Spartans, four or five centuries later? What but this, that every man passes personally through a Grecian period. The Grecian state is the era of the bodily nature, the perfection of the senses, -- of the spiritual nature unfolded in strict unity with the body. In it existed those human forms which supplied the sculptor with his models of Hercules, Phoebus, and Jove; not like the forms abounding in the streets of modern cities, wherein the face is a confused blur of features, but composed of incorrupt, sharply defined, and symmetrical features, whose eye-sockets are so formed that it would be impossible for such eyes to squint, and take furtive glances on this side and on that, but they must turn the whole head. The manners of that period are plain and fierce. The reverence exhibited is for personal qualities, courage, address, self-command, justice, strength, swiftness, a loud voice, a broad chest. Luxury and elegance are not known. A alt parse population and want make every man his own valet, cook, butcher, and soldier, and the habit of supplying his own needs educates the body to wonderful performances. Such are the Agamemnon and Diomed of Homer, and not far different is the picture Xenophon gives of himself and his compatriots in the Retreat of the Ten Thousand. "After the army had crossed the river Teleboas in Armenia, there fell much snow, and the troops lay miserably on the ground covered with it. But Xenophon arose naked, and, taking an axe, began to split wood; whereupon others rose and did the like." Throughout his army exists a boundless liberty of speech. They quarrel for plunder, they wrangle with the generals on each new order, and Xenophon is as sharp-tongued as any, and sharpertongued than most, and so gives as good as he gets. Who does not see that this is a gang of great boys, with such a code of honor and such lax discipline as great boys have?</div>

<div class="line_en">The costly charm of the ancient tragedy, and indeed of all the old literature, is, that the persons speak simply, -- speak as persons who have great good sense without knowing it, before yet the reflective habit has become the predominant habit of the mind. Our admiration of the antique is not admiration of the old, but of the natural. The Greeks are not reflective, but perfect in their senses and in their health, with the finest physical organization in the world. Adults acted with the simplicity and grace of children. They made vases, tragedies, and statues, such as healthy senses should, -- that is, in good taste. Such things have continued to be made in all ages, and are now, wherever a healthy physique exists; but, as a class, from their superior organization, they have surpassed all. They combine the energy of manhood with the engaging unconsciousness of childhood. The attraction of these manners is that they belong to man, and are known to every man in virtue of his being once a child; besides that there are always individuals who retain these characteristics. A person of childlike genius and inborn energy is still a Greek, and revives our love of the Muse of Hellas. I admire the love of nature in the Philoctetes. In reading those fine apostrophes to sleep, to the stars, rocks, mountains, and waves, I feel time passing away as an ebbing sea. I feel the eternity of man, the identity of his thought. The Greek had, it seems, the same fellow-beings as I. The sun and moon, water and fire, met his heart precisely as they meet mine. Then the vaunted distinction between Greek and English, between Classic and Romantic schools, seems superficial and pedantic.

<div class="line_en">The beautiful fables of the Greeks, being proper creations of the imagination and not of the fancy, are universal verities. What a range of meanings and what perpetual pertinence has the story of Prometheus! Beside its primary value as the first chapter of the history of Europe, (the mythology thinly veiling authentic facts, the invention of the mechanic arts, and the migration of colonies,) it gives the history of religion with some closeness to the faith of later ages. Prometheus is the Jesus of the old mythology. He is the friend of man; stands between the unjust "justice" of the Eternal Father and the race of mortals, and readily suffers all things on their account. But where it departs from the Calvinistic Christianity, and exhibits him as the defier of Jove, it represents a state of mind which readily appears wherever the doctrine of Theism is taught in a crude, objective form, and which seems the selfdefence of man against this untruth, namely, a discontent with the believed fact that a God exists, and a feeling that the obligation of reverence is onerous. It would steal, if it could, the fire of the Creator, and live apart from him, and independent of him. The Prometheus Vinctus is the romance of skepticism. Not less true to all time are the details of that stately apologue. Apollo kept the flocks of Admetus, said the poets. When the gods come among men, they are not known. Jesus was not; Socrates and Shakspeare were not. Antæus was suffocated by the gripe of Hercules, but every time he touched his mother earth, his strength was renewed. Man is the broken giant, and, in all his weakness, both his body and his mind are invigorated by habits of conversation with nature. The power of music, the power of poetry to unfix, and, as it were, clap wings to solid nature, interprets the riddle of Orpheus. The philosophical perception of identity through endless mutations of form makes him know the Proteus. What else am I who laughed or wept yesterday, who slept last night like a corpse, and this morning stood and ran? And what see I on any side but the transmigrations of Proteus? I can symbolize my thought by using the name of any creature, of any fact, because every creature is man agent or patient. Tantalus is but a name for you and me. Tantalus means the impossibility of drinking the waters of thought which are always gleaming and waving within sight of the soul. The transmigration of souls is no fable. I would it were; but men and women are only half human. Every animal of the barn-yard, the field, and the forest, of the earth and of the waters that are under the earth, has contrived to get a footing and to leave the print of its features and form in some one or other of these upright, heaven-facing speakers. Ah! brother, stop the ebb of thy soul, -- ebbing downward into the forms into whose habits thou hast now for many years slid. As near and proper to us is also that old fable of the Sphinx, who was said to sit in the road-side and put riddles to every passenger. If the man could not answer, she swallowed him alive. If he could solve the riddle, the Sphinx was slain. What is our life but an endless flight of winged facts or events! In splendid variety these changes come, all putting questions to the human spirit. Those men who cannot answer by a superior wisdom these facts or questions of time, serve them. Facts encumber them, tyrannize over them, and make the men of routine the men of sense, in whom a literal obedience to facts has extinguished every spark of that light by which man is truly man. But if the man is true to his better instincts or sentiments, and refuses the dominion of facts, as one that comes of a higher race, remains fast by the soul and sees the principle, then the facts fall aptly and supple into their places; they know their master, and the meanest of them glorifies him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="希腊人的美丽寓言完全是想象力的结晶，而不是幻想的产物，所以都是普遍的真理。普罗米修斯的故事寓意多么广阔，多么永久地恰当！它是欧洲历史的第一章（这则神话用一层薄幕遮住了真正的事实，机械工艺的发明，与向殖民地移民）。除了它这主要的价值之外，它同时也描绘了宗教史，那种与后世的信仰非常相近的宗教。普罗米修斯是古老神话中的耶稣。他是人类的朋友；他是站在永恒天父的不公正的“公正”与人类之间，愿意为他们忍受一切痛苦。但这和宗教改革主义者的基督教略有出入，将普罗米修斯表现为天神的挑战者也与宗教有出入，这里它代表一种精神状态；无论什么地方，如果人们以一种浅薄的客观的形势宣扬有神论，很快就会产生这种精神状态；这似乎是人的自卫，抵抗一种谎言，即人们都不满意只存在一个上帝这个为人所信的事实，而且觉得敬仰上帝的责任是一件麻烦事。如果可能，他会偷来造物者的火，与上帝分庭抗礼，摆脱上帝。《被缚的普罗米修斯》是怀疑主义的浪漫传奇，这高贵的寓言的一切细节也都适用于一切时代。诗人们说，阿波罗曾经替阿德墨托斯牧羊。诸神到人间来的时候，是没有人知道的。耶稣就不是；苏格拉底与莎士比亚也不是。安泰在将被赫拉克勒斯扼杀时，每当他碰到地母，他就又重新获得力量。人是衰弱的巨人，在他的衰弱状态中，他的身体与精神全靠与大自然沟通的习惯而获得活力。音乐的力量，诗歌的力量，似乎恣意翱翔在广阔的天空，并解答了奥菲斯的谜语。哲学的理解能够在无穷无尽的形式变化中看出相同之点，这使他能够明了那变化多端的海神普洛透斯。我不是普洛透斯是什么？昨天我笑了，或哭了，昨夜我睡得像个死尸一样，今天早上我则站着，奔跑着。无论我朝哪个方向看，所见芸芸众生岂不都是普洛透斯的转世？我可以用任何生物、任何事实的名字来象征我的思想，因为每一个生物都是人的代理人或病人。坦忒勒斯在你或我看来不过是一个名字。坦忒勒斯的意义是指我们无法饮到思想的泉水，虽然它永远在灵魂的视线内亮晶晶地摇摆着。轮回之说并不仅仅是一个寓言。我但愿它不过是一个寓言；然而男人与女人只是半个人。农场、田野、树林、地上、地下和水中的每一种动物，都设法在人类中获得一块立足之地，并且在这个或那个身体直立、面向天空、会说话的人身上设法留下自己的面貌与形体活动的痕迹。啊，我的兄弟，不要再让灵魂堕落了，不要再让灵魂堕落回那些形体了，多年来你已不知不觉染上了他们的习惯。那狮身人面兽的古老的寓言，对于我们也是一样地接近、恰当；它坐在路旁，给每一个行人出一个谜语。如果那人不能回答，它就生吞了他。如果他能够回答，狮身人面兽就被杀死。我们的生命是什么？不过是长着翅膀的事实或事件的无穷飞翔。它们变着法来向人的灵魂提出问题。有些人不能用优越的智慧应付面前的事实，答复面前的问题，就需要为它们服务。对于这些人，事实是一种累赘，事实控制他们，虐待他们，把他们变成遵守常规的人，有“见识”的人；他们对事实的一丝不苟的服从，甚至熄灭了他们身上那种使人之所以为人的每一个火花。但如果人忠实于自己更好的本能或感情，拒绝事实的统治，就像一个来自高等种族的人；他与灵魂紧紧相依，并且能够通晓原则，于是这些事实自会适当地顺从下来，并各得其所；它们认识自己的主人，它们中间最平庸者也能为他带来荣耀。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">See in Goethe's Helena the same desire that every word should be a thing. These figures, he would say, these Ch irons, Griffins, Phorkyas, Helen, and Leda, are somewhat, and do exert a specific influence on the mind. So far then are they eternal entities, as real to-day as in the first Olympiad. Much revolving them, he writes out freely his humor, and gives them body to his own imagination. And although that poem be as vague and fantastic as a dream, yet is it much more attractive than the more regular dramatic pieces of the same author, for the reason that it operates a wonderful relief to the mind from the routine of customary images, -- awakens the reader's invention and fancy by the wild freedom of the design, and by the unceasing succession of brisk shocks of surprise.</div>

<div class="line_en">The universal nature, too strong for the petty nature of the bard, sits on his neck and writes through his hand; so that when he seems to vent a mere caprice and wild romance, the issue is an exact allegory. Hence Plato said that "poets utter great and wise things which they do not themselves understand." All the fictions of the Middle Age explain themselves as a masked or frolic expression of that which in grave earnest the mind of that period toiled to achieve. Magic, and all that is ascribed to it, is a deep presentiment of the powers of science. The shoes of swiftness, the sword of sharpness, the power of subduing the elements, of using the secret virtues of minerals, of understanding the voices of birds, are the obscure efforts of the mind in a right direction. The preternatural prowess of the hero, the gift of perpetual youth, and the like, are alike the endeavour of the human spirit "to bend the shows of things to the desires of the mind."</div>

<div class="line_en">But along with the civil and metaphysical history of man, another history goes daily forward, -- that of the external world, -- in which he is not less strictly implicated. He is the compend of time; he is also the correlative of nature. His power consists in the multitude of his affinities, in the fact that his life is intertwined with the whole chain of organic and inorganic being. In old Rome the public roads beginning at the Forum proceeded north, south, east, west, to the centre of every province of the empire, making each market-town of Persia, Spain, and Britain pervious to the soldiers of the capital: so out of the human heart go, as it were, highways to the heart of every object in nature, to reduce it under the dominion of man. A man is a bundle of relations, a knot of roots, whose flower and fruitage is the world. His faculties refer to natures out of him, and predict the world he is to inhabit, as the fins of the fish foreshow that water exists, or the wings of an eagle in the egg presuppose air. He cannot live without a world. Put Napoleon in an island prison, let his faculties find no men to act on, no Alps to climb, no stake to play for, and he would beat the air and appear stupid. Transport him to large countries, dense population, complex interests, and antagonist power, and you shall see that the man Napoleon, bounded, that is, by such a profile and outline, is not the virtual Napoleon.

Do not the lovely attributes of the maiden child predict the refinements and decorations of civil society? Here also we are reminded of the action of man on man. A mind might ponder its thought for ages, and not gain so much selfknowledge as the passion of love shall teach it in a day. Who knows himself before he has been thrilled with indignation at an outrage, or has heard an eloquent tongue, or has shared the throb of thousands in a national exultation or alarm? No man can antedate his experience, or guess what faculty or feeling a new object shall unlock, any more than he can draw today the face of a person whom he shall see to-morrow for the first time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哥伦布需要有一个地球，才能筹划他的航线。牛顿与拉普拉斯需要无数年代与密布着星球的天空。我们可以说牛顿的心灵的性质已要寓言了一种重力吸引的太阳系。戴维或是盖·吕萨克的大脑自幼就开始研究微粒的相互吸引与排斥，也预示了机构定律。胎儿的眼睛难道不能预示光明？汉德尔的耳朵不是预言了和谐声音的魔力？瓦特、福尔顿、惠特默尔、阿克怀特建设性的手指，岂不预知了金属可溶解、可锻造的坚硬的质地，以及石头、水和木头的质地？小女孩可爱的品质岂不预示着文明社会的优雅与装饰？这里也使我们想到人对人的行为。人的一颗心灵可能数年间一直在沉思着自己的思想，但他从中所得的自我认识，也许还没有爱的激情一天教给他的多。一个人若从来没有因为某种暴行而震怒，从来没有听到雄辩的发言，从来没有参加过举国欢庆或人心惶惶的震荡，那他怎么知道自己？没有一个人能够事先预料他的经验，或是猜测一样新的物件将要启发哪一种功能或感觉，正如他今天无法画出明天初次见面时的一个人的脸像一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I will not now go behind the general statement to explore the reason of this correspondency. Let it suffice that in the light of these two facts, namely, that the mind is One, and that nature is its correlative, history is to be read and written.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这仅是一般性的陈述，我现在就不进一步研究它们一致性的理由了。总之，历史的读法与做法，都需要参照这两件事实：思想是一个整体，而大自然是与它息息相关的，历史就是见证和记载的过程。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Thus in all ways does the soul concentrate and reproduce its treasures for each pupil. He, too, shall pass through the whole cycle of experience. He shall collect into a focus the rays of nature. History no longer shall be a dull book. It shall walk incarnate in every just and wise man. You shall not tell me by languages and titles a catalogue of the volumes you have read. You shall make me feel what periods you have lived. A man shall be the Temple of Fame. He shall walk, as the poets have described that goddess, in a robe painted all over with wonderful events and experiences; -- his own form and features by their exalted intelligence shall be that variegated vest. I shall find in him the Foreworld; in his childhood the Age of Gold; the Apples of Knowledge; the Argonautic Expedition; the calling of Abraham; the building of the Temple; the Advent of Christ; Dark Ages; the Revival of Letters; the Reformation; the discovery of new lands; the opening of new sciences, and new regions in man. He shall be the priest of Pan, and bring with him into humble cottages the blessing of the morning stars and all the recorded benefits of heaven and earth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以，灵魂采取了一切方式为自己的每一个学生都收集和生产着宝藏。学生也需要经历整套经验，他要将大自然的光线汇聚到一个焦点。这样，历史不再是一本无聊乏味的书，它将具体体现在每一个正义和明哲之士身上。你不必告诉我你所读的史书是什么语言，书名是什么，你应该让我感觉到你经历了那些历史时期。一个人应当是一个名人殿。他应当像诗人们所描绘的那位女神那样，穿着一件绘满奇妙事件与经历的长袍行走着——他自己的体态与容貌因其高贵的智力，将成为那件色彩斑斓的祭袍。我将在他身上发现洪荒世界，在他的童年看到“黄金时代”、“智慧的苹果”、“伊尔戈的远征”、亚伯拉罕的感召、圣殿的修筑、“基督的降临”，中世纪的“黑暗时代”、“文艺复兴”、“宗教改革”、新大陆的发现，以及新科学的开拓与人类新领域的开发。他将成为潘神的祭司，将晨星的祝福与天上人间一切有记载的福祉，都带进蓬门荜户。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Is there somewhat overweening in this claim? Then I reject all I have written, for what is the use of pretending to know what we know not? But it is the fault of our rhetoric that we cannot strongly state one fact without seeming to belie some other. I hold our actual knowledge very cheap. Hear the rats in the wall, see the lizard on the fence, the fungus under foot, the lichen on the log. What do I know sympathetically, morally, of either of these worlds of life? As old as the Caucasian man, -- perhaps older, -- these creatures have kept their counsel beside him, and there is no record of any word or sign that has passed from one to the other. What connection do the books show between the fifty or sixty chemical elements, and the historical eras? Nay, what does history yet record of the metaphysical annals of man? What light does it shed on those mysteries which we hide under the names Death and Immortality? Yet every history should be written in a wisdom which divined the range of our affinities and looked at facts as symbols. I am ashamed to see what a shallow village tale our so-called History is. How many times we must say Rome, and Paris, and Constantinople! What does Rome know of rat and lizard? What are Olympiads and Consulates to these neighbouring systems of being? Nay, what food or experience or succour have they for the Esquimaux seal-hunter, for the Kanàka in his canoe, for the fisherman, the stevedore, the porter?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这种要求是不是有点过于自负？那我就否决我所写的一切，因为假装知道我们所不知道的事有什么用呢？我们在着重表达一种事实时，又似乎必须歪曲另一件事实，这都是因为我们修辞学的错误。我很看不起我们的实际知识，你听听墙壁里的老鼠，看看篱笆上的蜥蜴，脚下踏着的菌类，木材上生的苔藓。无论是从同情的角度还是从道德的角度，我对其中任何一种生命的生活世界知道些什么呢？这些生物与高加索人种一样古老——也许还要更老些；它们在人类的旁边默默地不发表意见，从来没有任何记载说到它们曾谈过话或打过手势。书上是否指出过五十种或六十种化学元素与历史时代的关系？不但如此，历史是否记载过人类的哲学年鉴？是否解释过我们隐藏在“死”与“生”这两个名词下的种种神秘？然而，每一个书写历史的人都应当有一种智慧，能够揣度与我们类似的事物的范围，能够将事实看作象征。我们的所谓的历史只是一种浅薄的村俗故事，我看到它感到很惭愧。我们为什么总是把罗马、巴黎、康斯坦丁堡挂在口上！罗马对于蜥蜴知道些什么？老鼠与蜥蜴都是与我们邻近的生命系统，但是奥林匹克运动会与执政时代对于它们有什么意义？不但如此，它们可有什么食物或经验或救济提供给猎海豹的爱斯基摩人，给小船上的南洋群岛的土著人，给渔民，给装卸工，给脚夫？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Broader and deeper we must write our annals, -- from an ethical reformation, from an influx of the ever new, ever sanative conscience, -- if we would trulier express our central and wide-related nature, instead of this old chronology of selfishness and pride to which we have too long lent our eyes. Already that day exists for us, shines in on us at unawares, but the path of science and of letters is not the way into nature. The idiot, the Indian, the child, and unschooled farmer's boy, stand nearer to the light by which nature is to be read, than the dissector or the antiquary.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们的天性位于核心，关系非常广泛。如果我们要真正地表现我们那天性，而不仅只要古老的，记载的全是我们已经阅读得太久的自私与骄傲的历史，我们必须将历史记载得更博大、更深刻——不但要写道德的改革，也要写那永远新鲜、永远需要治疗的良心。对我们来说，这一天已经来临了；就在我们不知不觉之间，它已照耀在我们身上，但科学与文学的道路并不是通向大自然的道路。愚人、印第安人、小孩和从未受过教育的农家子弟倒比那些解剖学家或者考古学家离光明更近些。">查看中文翻译</div>
