<div class="line_en">Patrick and I had met while I was doing the only other job I have ever held, that of trainee at The Cutting Edge, Hailsbury's only unisex hairdresser's He walked in while Samantha, the proprietor, was busy, asking for a number four. I gave him what he described afterwards as the worst haircut not only that he had ever had, but the worst haircut in the history of mankind. Three months later, realizing that a love of fiddling with my own hair did not necessarily mean that I was cut out to do anyone else's I left and got the job at the cafe with Frank.</div>

<div class="line_en">Spring arrived overnight, as if winter, like some unwanted guest, had abruptly shrugged its way into its coat and vanished, without saying goodbye. Everything became greener, the roads bathed in watery sunshine, the air suddenly balmy. There were hints of something floral and welcoming in the air, birdsong the gentle backdrop to the day.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一夜之间春天就来了，冬天就像一个不待见的客人，穿上外套突然消失了，不辞而别。到处绿意盎然、生机勃勃，道路沐浴在淡淡的阳光中，空气宜人，弥漫着花香和温暖的气息，鸟儿也唱起缱绻的歌。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I didn't notice any of it. I had stayed at Patrick's house the evening before. It was the first time I had seen him for almost a week due to his enhanced training schedule, but having spent forty minutes in the bath with half a pack of bath salts, he was so exhausted he could barely talk to me. I had begun stroking his back, in a rare attempt at seduction, and he had murmured that he was really too tired, his hand flicking as if he were swatting me away. I was still awake and staring at his ceiling discontentedly four hours later.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些我都没有留意。前一晚我一直待在帕特里克的房子里。因为他加强了训练，一周以来这是我第一次见他。他在浴室待了四十分钟，泡掉了半包浴盐，筋疲力尽，懒得跟我说话。我抚摸着他的肩，很难得地挑逗他，他低声说他真的太累了，他的手抖动着似乎要把我推开。四个小时后，我还没有睡着，满腹牢骚地盯着天花板。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When we started going out, Patrick had been working in sales and his favourite things could have been listed as beer, garage chocolate, talking about sport and sex (doing, not talking about), in that order. A good night out for us would probably comprise all four. He was ordinary-looking rather than handsome, and his bum was podgier than mine, but I liked it. I liked the solidity of him, the way he felt when I wrapped myself around him. His dad was dead and I liked the way he acted towards his mother; protective and solicitous. And his four brothers and sisters were like the Waltons. They actually seemed to like each other. The first time we went out on a date, a little voice in my head said: This man will never hurt you, and nothing he had done in the seven years since had led me to doubt it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们开始约会时，帕特里克做着销售工作，他最喜欢的东西排序如下：啤酒、车库巧克力、谈论运动和性（做爱，不是谈）。对我们俩来说，一个完美的晚上就包括这四项。他长相普通，谈不上帅，屁股比我的还大，但我喜欢。我喜欢他的稳健，我沉醉于紧紧环抱住他的那种感觉。他父亲去世了，我欣赏他对待他母亲的那种方式：保护有加又关怀备至。他的四个兄弟姊妹都喜欢沃尔顿家族，他们看起来真的喜欢彼此。我们第一次约会的时候，一个细小的声音在我心里说：这个男人永远不会伤害你。七年以来，他也从未做过任何事情，让我怀疑这点。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Patrick's stomach no longer gave when I nestled into him; it was a hard, unforgiving thing, like a sideboard, and he was prone to pulling up his shirt and hitting it with things, to prove quite how hard it was. His face was planed, and weathered from his time spent constantly outdoors. His thighs were solid muscle. That would have been quite sexy in itself, had he actually wanted to have sex. But we were down to about twice a month, and I wasn't the kind to ask.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我紧贴住他时，他的腹部不再有反应，坚硬无情，像钢板；他动不动就拉起衬衣，用肚子撞击东西，来证明它有多坚硬。他的脸扁平，由于长期进行户外活动晒得黝黑。他的大腿很结实，就其本身而言非常性感，如果他想做爱的话。但是我们已经减少到一个月大约两次了，我不想问原因。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was as if the fitter he got, the more obsessed by his own shape he became, the less interested he was in mine. I asked him a couple of times if he didn't fancy me any more, but he seemed pretty definite. "You're gorgeous," he would say. "I'm just shattered. Anyway, I don't want you to lose weight. The girls at the club -- you couldn't make one decent boob out of all of theirs put together." I wanted to ask how exactly he had come to work out this complex equation, but it was basically a nice thing to say so I let it go.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="似乎他越强健，就越为自己的身材着迷，就越发对我的身体不感兴趣。我问了他好几次他是不是不再喜欢我了，他的回答又似乎很肯定。“你棒极了，”他会这么说，“我只是累得快散架了。无论如何，我不希望你减肥。俱乐部的女孩——让她们都穿着比基尼站在一起，也找不出一个丰满的。”我想问他究竟是如何得出这个结论的，但大致说来，他这样说很让人高兴，我也就不再问了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I wanted to be interested in what he did, I really did. I went to the triathlon club nights, I tried to chat to the other girls. But I soon realized I was an anomaly -- there were no girlfriends like me -- everyone else in the club was single, or involved with someone equally physically impressive. The couples pushed each other on workouts, planned weekends in spandex shorts and carried pictures of each other in their wallets completing triathlons hand in hand, or smugly comparing joint medals. It was unspeakable.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我想对他做的事情表示兴趣，我也确实这么做了。我参加铁人三项俱乐部晚上的聚会，我试着跟其他女孩聊天。但我很快就觉察到自己是个异类——他们没有我这样的女朋友——俱乐部的其他人要么单身，要么跟同样身材傲人的人交往。那些情侣在训练中互相推搡，商量着周末的跑步计划，钱包里放着两人手牵手完成铁人三项的照片，并沾沾自喜地对照集体奖牌。真是难以言说。">查看中文翻译</div>

Patrick's job, his whole social life now revolved around the control of flesh -- taming it, reducing it, honing it. What if, faced with those tight little tracksuited bottoms, my own suddenly seemed wanting? What if my curves, which I had always thought of as pleasantly voluptuous, now seemed doughy to his exacting eyes?</div>

<div class="line_en">These were the thoughts that were still humming messily around my head as Mrs Traynor came in and pretty much ordered Will and me to go outside. "I've asked the cleaners to come and do a special spring clean, so I thought perhaps you could enjoy the nice weather while they're all in there."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特雷纳夫人进来时，我脑子里还萦绕着这些思绪。她几乎是用命令的口气让威尔和我去外面。“我让清洁工来搞一个特别的新春大扫除，他们在这里忙上忙下时，也许你们可以享受一下好天气。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It wasn't an entirely unreasonable suggestion. The garden was beautiful. It was as if with the slight lifting of temperatures everything had suddenly decided to look a little bit greener. Daffodils had emerged as if from nowhere, their yellowing bulbs hinting at the flowers to come. Buds burst from brown branches, perennials forcing their way tentatively through the dark, claggy soil. I opened the doors and we went outside, Will keeping his chair on the York stone path. He gestured towards a cast-iron bench with a cushion on it, and I sat there for some time, our faces lifted to the weak sunshine, listening to the sparrows squabbling in the hedgerow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这并不是个不可理喻的建议。花园很漂亮，似乎随着温度的稍微提升，一切事物都更绿了一些。水仙花不知道从哪儿冒了出来，黄色的球茎暗示着即将开花。褐色的树枝上迸出了绿芽，多年生植物从黑色而黏结的泥土中使劲探出头来。我打开门，我们到了户外，威尔把轮椅停在了约克石板路上。他示意我坐到放上了垫子的铸铁长椅上，我在那儿坐了一会儿，我们置身于淡淡的阳光下，听着麻雀在树篱间叽叽喳喳鸣叫。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I pushed myself upright, and turned to face him. His house chair had a control button that elevated his seat so that he could address people at head height. He didn't often use it, as it frequently made him dizzy, but it was working now. I actually had to look up at him.</div>

<div class="line_en">But the most debilitating was a burning sensation in his hands and feet; relentless, pulsing, it would leave him unable to focus on anything else. I would prepare a bowl of cold water and soak them, or wrap cold flannels around them, hoping to ease his discomfort. A stringy muscle would flicker in his jaw and occasionally he would just seem to disappear, as if the only way he could cope with the sensation was to absent himself from his own body. I had become surprisingly used to the physical requirements of Will's life. It seemed unfair that despite the fact he could not use them, or feel them, his extremities should cause him so much discomfort.</div>

I worked in silence, studying Will Traynor's face as I went, the lines that ran to the corners of his mouth, lines that seemed prematurely deep for his age. I smoothed his hair from the side of his face and saw the telltale tracks of stitches, perhaps from his accident. I saw the mauve shadows that told of nights and nights of lost sleep, the furrow between his brows that spoke of silent pain. A warm sweetness rose from his skin, the scent of the shaving cream, and something that was peculiar to Will himself, discreet and expensive. His face began to emerge and I could see how easy it must have been for him to attract someone like Alicia.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a curiously intimate thing, this shaving of Will. I realized as I continued that I had assumed his wheelchair would be a barrier; that his disability would prevent any kind of sensual aspect from creeping in. Weirdly, it wasn't working like that. It was impossible to be this close to someone, to feel their skin tauten under your fingertips, to breathe in the air that they breathed out, to have their face only inches from yours, without feeling a little unbalanced. By the time I reached his other ear I had begun to feel awkward, as if I had overstepped an invisible mark.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="给威尔刮胡子是件有些怪异的私密事情，我原以为他的轮椅会是一个障碍：他的残疾会将任何种类的欲望排除在外。不可思议的是，事情并不是那样。和他挨得如此近，感觉到指尖下面他的肌肤绷紧，呼进他吐出来的气息，跟他的脸只相隔几英寸，这样的情境很难不让人内心荡漾。进展到他的另一只耳朵时，我开始觉得别扭，好像我已经越过了隐形线。">查看中文翻译</div>
