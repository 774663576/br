<div class="line_en">Every cell in my body wants me to dig into the stew and cram it, handful by handful into my mouth. But Peeta's voice stops me. "We better take it slow on that stew. Remember the first night on the train? The rich food made me sick and I wasn't even starving then."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我真想一头扎进炖肉里，然后大口大口地塞到嘴里，三下五除二地把它吃光。可皮塔制止了我。“那炖肉咱们最好慢慢吃，还记得咱们在火车上的第一个夜晚吗？吃得太多，我都觉得恶心，从那以后我甚至都不觉得饿啦。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You're right. And I could just inhale the whole thing!" I say regretfully. But I don't. We are quite sensible. We each have a roll, half an apple, and an egg-size serving of stew and rice. I make myself eat the stew in tiny spoonfuls -- they even sent us silverware and plates -- savoring each bite. When we finish, I stare longingly at the dish. "I want more."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你说得对，我也不可能把这些东西一口吃光！”我很遗憾地说。其实我们并不遗憾，我们很理智。我们一人吃了一个蛋卷，半个苹果，鸡蛋大的大米炖肉。我小口吃着炖肉——他们甚至送来了银餐具和盘子——让我们慢慢品尝食物。我们吃完后，我仍然很眼馋地看着饭菜。“我还想吃。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I make room for him in the sleeping bag. We lean back against the cave wall, my head on his shoulder, his arms wrapped around me. I can feel Haymitch nudging me to keep up the act. "So, since we were five, you never even noticed any other girls?" I ask him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我在睡袋里给他腾出地方。我们斜倚在洞壁上，我的头靠在他肩上，他用胳膊抱着我。我能感觉到黑密斯在说——要保持这个姿势。“那么，我们一共五个人，你没注意别的女孩吗？”我问他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, I noticed just about every girl, but none of them made a lasting impression but you," he says.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，我看了几乎每个女孩，可只有你给我留下的印象最持久。”他说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, that's right. That's what I was thinking," he says. "Scoot over, I'm freezing."</div>

<div class="line_en">That's right. If we win, we'll each get a house in the part of town reserved for Hunger Games' victors. Long ago, when the Games began, the Capitol had built a dozen fine houses in each district. Of course, in ours only one is occupied. Most of the others have never been lived in at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没错，如果我们赢得比赛，我们每人会得到一所专为饥饿游戏胜出者准备的房子。很久以前，饥饿游戏起始阶段，凯匹特在每个区各修建了十二所漂亮房子。当然，我们区只有一所房子有人住。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I told you, he hates me!" I say, but I can't help laughing at the image of Haymitch becoming my new pal.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Ah, that'll be nice," says Peeta, tightening his arms around me. "You and me and Haymitch. Very cozy. Picnics, birthdays, long winter nights around the fire retelling old Hunger Games tales."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，这很好吗，”皮塔说，紧紧搂了我一下。“你、我还有黑密斯，很舒适。野餐呀、生日宴会呀，我们还可以在冬日漫长的夜晚围坐在火边，讲饥饿游戏的故事。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Only sometimes. When he's sober, I've never heard him say one negative thing about you," says Peeta.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“有时候他也许是，可他严肃起来的时候，我没听他说过你一句坏话。”皮塔说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That's right. Who am I thinking of? Oh, I know. It's Cinna who likes you. But that's mainly because you didn't try to run when he set you on fire," says Peeta. "On the other hand, Haymitch… well, if I were you, I'd avoid Haymitch completely. He hates you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“也是啊。我想说谁来着？噢，对了，西纳喜欢你，主要是因为他给你点火时，你没逃跑的缘故。”皮塔说，“至于他，黑密斯…嗯，如果我是你，我也会躲开他，他是不喜欢你。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He's never sober!" I protest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可他从来都没严肃过！”我反对道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“他更讨厌我，”皮塔说，“我觉得他和大多数人都格格不入。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I know the audience will enjoy our having fun at Haymitch's expense. He has been around so long, he's practically an old friend to some of them. And after his head-dive off the stage at the reaping, everybody knows him. By this time, they'll have dragged him out of the control room for interviews about us. No telling what sort of lies he's made up. He's at something of a disadvantage because most mentors have a partner, another victor to help them whereas Haymitch has to be ready to go into action at any moment. Kind of like me when I was alone in the arena. I wonder how he's holding up, with the drinking, the attention, and the stress of trying to keep us alive.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我知道观众很喜欢我们拿黑密斯寻开心。他参与比赛的时间太长了，对一些人而言，他已经是张太过熟悉的面孔。自从他在收获节仪式上从台上栽下来以后，他已家喻户晓。此时此刻，肯定有人已经把他从控制室拽出来，接受关于我们的采访。不知道他又会编出什么样的瞎话。他的处境很不利，因为多数指导老师都有搭档，他们可以相互帮衬，可黑密斯得随时准备应战。有点像我在竞技场孤军奋战的情形。他又喜欢喝酒，又要保持清醒，还要设法让我们活下来，我纳闷他是怎么应付这一切的。">查看中文翻译</div>

</div>
<div class="line_en">A thought hits me, and I'm amazed the question's taken so long to surface. Maybe it's because I've only recently begun to view Haymitch with a degree of curiosity. "How do you think he did it?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我突然想起一件事，惊异于我脑子里出现这个问题时间之久，也许因为直到最近我才对黑密斯产生好奇心吧。“你觉得他是怎么做到的？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Who? Did what?" Peeta asks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“谁？做到什么？”皮塔问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Haymitch. How do you think he won the Games?" I say.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“黑密斯，他是怎么赢得比赛的？”我说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It's funny. Haymitch and I don't get along well in person, but maybe Peeta is right about us being alike because he seems able to communicate with me by the timing of his gifts. Like how I knew I must be close to water when he withheld it and how I knew the sleep syrup just wasn't something to ease Peeta's pain and how I know now that I have to play up the romance. He hasn't made much effort to connect with Peeta really. Perhaps he thinks a bowl of broth would just be a bowl of broth to Peeta, whereas I'll see the strings attached to it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="很可笑，我和黑密斯私下处得关系不太好，可也许皮塔说得对，我们很相像，在很多事情上，我似乎和他也心有灵犀：例如送礼物的时间控制，在他迟迟不给我水时，我知道已靠近水源，再如咳嗽安眠糖浆不是用来给皮塔止痛，还有现在我该上演的浪漫故事。其实他没花很多力气跟皮塔沟通，也许他觉得对皮塔而言，一碗肉汤就是一碗肉汤，而我却能看出这其中的玄机。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Peeta considers this quite a while before he answers. Haymitch is sturdily built, but no physical wonder like Cato or Thresh. He's not particularly handsome. Not in the way that causes sponsors to rain gifts on you. And he's so surly, it's hard to imagine anyone teaming up with him. There's only one way Haymitch could have won, and Peeta says it just as I'm reaching this conclusion myself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮塔想了半天，没有回答。黑密斯身体强壮，可在块头上比不上加图和萨里什。他也不特别英俊，不是能让赞助人给他大把礼物的那种。而他又性情乖戾，很难想象有人愿意跟他搭伴。只有靠一种方法黑密斯能赢。我刚说出原因，皮塔也脱口而出。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">About half an hour has passed before I decide I have to eat again. Peeta's too hungry himself to put up an argument. While I'm dishing up two more small servings of lamb stew and rice, we hear the anthem begin to play. Peeta presses his eyes against a crack in the rocks to watch the sky.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大约半个小时过去了，我觉得还得吃点什么。皮塔自己也太饿，不能与我争辩。我们舀出两勺米饭炖肉，正准备吃，国歌响起来了。皮塔从石缝里朝外面的天空看去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I nod, then let the conversation drop. But secretly I'm wondering if Haymitch sobered up long enough to help Peeta and me because he thought we just might have the wits to survive. Maybe he wasn't always a drunk. Maybe, in the beginning, he tried to help the tributes. But then it got unbearable. It must be hell to mentor two kids and then watch them die. Year after year after year. I realize that if I get out of here, that will become my job. To mentor the girl from District 12. The idea is so repellent, I thrust it from my mind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我点点头，没再吱声。私下里我又觉得，黑密斯清醒的时间是否够长，来保证我和皮塔活下去，因为他觉得我们有足够的智慧活下去。也许他并不总是醉醺醺的。也许，当指导老师的起始阶段，他确实帮助过选手，慢慢地他觉得难以忍受。指导两个孩子，然后又眼睁睁地看着他们死去确实痛苦异常。我意识到，如果我能从这里出去，那么，一年一年又一年，这也将成为我的工作。为十二区的女孩做指导，真不情愿。我决计不去想它。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There won't be anything to see tonight," I say, far more interested in the stew than the sky. "Nothing's happened or we would've heard a cannon."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Are you sure? I mean, it's pouring buckets out there. I don't know how you can see anything," I say. I push him away from the rocks and squint out into the dark, rainy sky. For about ten seconds, I catch a distorted glimpse of Thresh's picture and then he's gone. Just like that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你肯定吗？我是说，天上下着瓢泼大雨，我不知你是怎么看到的。”我说。我把他从石缝边推开，向外面漆黑的雨夜看去。大约有十秒钟，我看到萨里什扭曲的图像，这么说，他真的离去了。就这么走了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm going to split one. But I'll save the cheese for tomorrow," I say. I see Peeta staring at me. "What?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我要分一个，但我把奶酪留到明天。”我说。我看到皮塔只盯着我，“什么？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He can't be," I say.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他不可能。”我说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I give a noncommittal shrug and cup my elbows in my hands, hugging them close to my body. I have to bury the real pain because who's going to bet on a tribute who keeps sniveling over the deaths of her opponents. Rue was one thing. We were allies. She was so young. But no one will understand my sorrow at Thresh's murder. The word pulls me up short. Murder! Thankfully, I didn't say it aloud. That's not going to win me any points in the arena. What I do say is, "It's just… if we didn't win… I wanted Thresh to. Because he let me go. And because of Rue."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我耸耸肩，心里乱乱的。我两臂相交，贴近自己的身体，尽量掩饰自己的真实感情。否则，谁会赞助一个为其他选手死亡而痛惜的人昵？露露是另外一回事，我们是伙伴。而她又很小。可此时无人理解我对萨里什故去的哀痛。一个词在我的脑海涌现：谋杀！感谢上帝，我没喊出来，不然在竞技场对我也一点好处没有。我支支吾吾地说：“事实上，如果咱们赢不了…我希望萨里什赢，因为他放走了我，还有就是露露。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I slump down against the rocks, momentarily forgetting about the task at hand. Thresh dead. I should be happy, right? One less tribute to face. And a powerful one, too. But I'm not happy. All I can think about is Thresh letting me go, letting me run because of Rue, who died with that spear in her stomach…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我怔怔地跌坐在石壁旁，暂时忘了手里的活计。萨里什死了。我本应高兴，不是吗？又少了一个对手，一个强劲的对手。可我并不高兴，我脑中浮现出的全是萨里什放我走的情形，他为了露露——那个腹部中矛的女孩——而放走了我。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We finish our food in silence and then Peeta offers to take the first watch. I burrow down in the sleeping bag next to him, pulling my hood up over my face to hide it from the cameras.

<div class="line_en">When Peeta wakes me later, the first thing I register is the smell of goat cheese. He's holding out half a roll spread with the creamy white stuff and topped with apple slices. "Don't be mad," he says. "I had to eat again. Here's your half."</div>

<div class="line_en">For the first time, I allow myself to truly think about the possibility that I might make it home. To fame. To wealth. To my own house in the Victor's Village. My mother and Prim would live there with me. No more fear of hunger. A new kind of freedom. But then… what? What would my life be like on a daily basis? Most of it has been consumed with the acquisition of food. Take that away and I'm not really sure who I am, what my identity is. The idea scares me some. I think of Haymitch, with all his money. What did his life become? He lives alone, no wife or children, most of his waking hours drunk. I don't want to end up like that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我第一次思考自己回家的可能性。我想到了荣誉，想到了财富，想到位于胜利者村属于自己的房子。妈妈和波丽姆可以和我一起住在那里。再也不用担心挨饿，这是一种新的自由。然后呢？…怎么样？我每天的生活会是什么样？以前每日都在为三餐奔波，现在改变了，我不清楚自己究竟是谁，是什么身份。这么一想，我感到心里一阵发慌。我想到了黑密斯，他很富有，可他的生活又怎样？他独自一人，没有妻子儿女，他大部分醒着的时候都醉醺醺的。我可不想落到这种地步。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Somewhere during my shift, the rain stops not gradually but all at once. The downpour ends and there's only the residual drippings of water from branches, the rush of the now overflowing stream below us. A full, beautiful moon emerges, and even without the glasses I can see outside. I can't decide if the moon is real or merely a projection of the Gamemakers. I know it was full shortly before I left home. Gale and I watched it rise as we hunted into the late hours.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我担任警戒时，雨不是慢慢地下，而是突然停了。倾盆大雨已经停歇，只有水滴从树枝上慢慢滑落，我们身边的小溪哗哗地流淌着。天上升起一轮满月，很美，即使不戴眼镜，周围的一切也能看得很清楚。我看不出月亮究竟是真的，还是大赛组织者制作的一个影像。我回想起离家前一晚月亮是圆的，盖尔和我在最后的几小时打猎时，看着它升起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">How long have I been gone? I'm guessing it's been about two weeks in the arena, and there was that week of preparation in the Capitol. Maybe the moon has completed its cycle. For some reason, I badly want it to be my moon, the same one I see from the woods around District 12. That would give me something to cling to in the surreal world of the arena where the authenticity of everything is to be doubted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我已经离家多久了？我约莫着来竞技场已经有两周了，再加上在凯匹特准备的一周，也许月亮又该圆了。不知怎的，我特别渴望此时高挂天空的就是我们家乡的月亮，是我在十二区看到的同一个月亮。这样，在一切都是虚构的竞技场的超现实世界里，总算有点真实的存在。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"But you won't be alone," I whisper to myself. I have my mother and Prim. Well, for the time being. And then… I don't want to think about then, when Prim has grown up, my mother passed away. I know I'll never marry, never risk bringing a child into the world. Because if there's one thing being a victor doesn't guarantee, it's your children's safety. My kids' names would go right into the reaping balls with everyone else's. And I swear I'll never let that happen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可你不会孤独的。”我轻声对自己说。我有妈妈和波丽姆。嗯，现在是这样，然后呢？…波丽姆长大了，妈妈过世了，我不愿想以后的事。我知道自己永远不会结婚，不会冒险把一个孩子带到这个世界来，因为胜利者也不能完全保证自己孩子的安全，孩子的名字会和其他人的名字一起放到收获节仪式上的大玻璃球里，我发誓永远不会让这一幕重演。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The sun eventually rises, its light slipping through the cracks and illuminating Peeta's face. Who will he transform into if we make it home? This perplexing, good-natured boy who can spin out lies so convincingly the whole of Panem believes him to be hopelessly in love with me, and I'll admit it, there are moments when he makes me believe it myself? At least, we'll be friends, I think. Nothing will change the fact that we've saved each other's lives in here. And beyond that, he will always be the boy with the bread. Good friends. Anything beyond that though… and I feel Gale's gray eyes watching me watching Peeta, all the way from District 12.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="太阳终于升起了，阳光透过石头缝隙射进来，照在皮塔的脸上。如果我们真能回家，他的生活会变得怎样？这个令人费解可又善良的男孩会编织出令人信服的谎言，让整个帕纳姆国人都相信他已疯狂地爱上了我。而且我也承认，有几次，甚至我都相信了他。至少，我想我们会成为朋友，我们救过彼此的命，这是不容更改的事实。无论怎样，他永远都是那个送给我面包的男孩，是好朋友。除此之外…我感觉盖尔的灰眼睛一直在跟踪着我和皮塔，从十二区直至竞技场。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Once we're packed up and standing outside our cave, our mood shifts to serious. It's as though for the last few days, sheltered by the rocks and the rain and Cato's preoccupation with Thresh, we were given a respite, a holiday of sorts. Now, although the day is sunny and warm, we both sense we're really back in the Games. I hand Peeta my knife, since whatever weapons he once had are long gone, and he slips it into his belt. My last seven arrows -- of the twelve I sacrificed three in the explosion, two at the feast -- rattle a bit too loosely in the quiver. I can't afford to lose any more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们打好行囊，来到洞外，立刻严肃起来。过去的几天，加图在追踪萨里什，我们躲在大雨的洞中，紧张的情绪得到暂时的放松，好像度过了一个假期。现在，虽然阳光明媚，天气和暖，可我们两个都觉得又回到了饥饿游戏中。我把刀子递给皮塔，无论他原来曾有过什么武器，现在早已不知去向，他把刀子别在腰里。我最后的七支箭——原来的十二支，在爆炸中用掉三支，宴会时用了两支——在松垮垮的箭袋中哐啷哐啷响。我不能再失掉自己的箭了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">With all the rain, the stream has overrun its banks by several feet on either side. We stop there to replenish our water. I check the snares I set days ago and come up empty. Not surprising with the weather. Besides, I haven't seen many animals or signs of them in this area.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="下了几天雨，两岸的水已经涨高了几英尺。我们停下来往水瓶里灌满水。我检查了一下几天前下的套，什么也没打到。在这样的天气里，也不奇怪。另外，在这一区域，我没见过很多动物的踪迹。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Keep an eye out," I say. "Stay on the rocks as much as possible, no sense in leaving him tracks to follow. And listen for both of us." It's clear, at this point, that the explosion destroyed the hearing in my left ear for good.</div>

<div class="line_en">As we head up alongside the stream, we pass the place where I found Peeta camouflaged in the weeds and mud.

Otherwise, I wouldn't risk it with Cato after us.</div>

<div class="line_en">The boulders diminish to rocks that eventually turn to pebbles, and then, to my relief, we're back on pine needles and the gentle incline of the forest floor. For the first time, I realize we have a problem. Navigating the rocky terrain with a bad leg -- well, you're naturally going to make some noise. But even on the smooth bed of needles, Peeta is loud.

<div class="line_en">Needless to say, although it takes several hours to reach my old camp with Rue, I've shot nothing. If the stream would settle down, fish might be an option, but the current is still too strong. As we stop to rest and drink water, I try to work out a solution. Ideally, I'd dump Peeta now with some simple root-gathering chore and go hunt, but then he'd be left with only a knife to defend himself against Cato's spears and superior strength. So what I'd really like is to try and conceal him somewhere safe, then go hunt, and come back and collect him. But I have a feeling his ego isn't going to go for that suggestion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不用说，虽然花了几个小时才走到我和露露原来的宿营地，但我一个猎物也没逮到。如果细流平缓，还可以抓鱼；可现在溪流很急。我们坐下休息喝水时，我琢磨着能有什么办法。我留下皮塔采摘植物根，自己去打猎。那样，他就只有一把刀用于自卫并对付加图的长矛，加图显然占有优势。所以最好的办法是把他藏在一个安全的地方，然后去打猎，之后再来找他。可我感觉以他的自负性格，他是不会同意这么做的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，”我耐心地说，“我也脱掉，这样咱俩声音都轻得多。”这么说就好像我也发出挺大声音似的。随后，我们俩都脱掉靴子和袜子。声音是小些了，但我肯定他正用力踩折每一根树枝。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Here?" he asks in disbelief, as if I'd asked him to walk barefoot on hot coals or something. I have to remind myself that he's still not used to the woods, that it's the scary, forbidden place beyond the fences of District 12. I think of Gale, with his velvet tread. It's eerie how little sound he makes, even when the leaves have fallen and it's a challenge to move at all without chasing off the game. I feel certain he's laughing back home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“在这里？”他以怀疑的口气问，好像我要他光脚在火炭上走似的。我不得不提醒自己他还很不适应森林，那里是十二区围障外的可怕禁区。这时我又想起盖尔轻盈的脚步。他的声音那么小，真奇怪，当树叶掉光的时候，即使不追赶猎物，悄声地在地面上走也很困难。我敢肯定，他正在家里笑呢！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"All right. Because that's what happened with Rue, and I watched her die!" I say. I turn away from him, go to the pack and open a fresh bottle of water, although I still have some in mine. But I'm not ready to forgive him. I notice the food. The rolls and apples are untouched, but someone's definitely picked away part of the cheese. "And you ate without me!" I really don't care, I just want something else to be mad about.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好的。因为露露就是这么出事的，我眼看着她死去！”我说。我转过身背对着他，又从背包里拿出一瓶水，尽管我自己的瓶里还有水。我不打算原谅他。我注意到那些食物，苹果和蛋卷都没动，可奶酪显然有人拿走了一些。“我不在时，你还一个人吃东西！”其实，我并不在乎，只是想找他的茬。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I push away, trying to sort out my feelings. "If two people agree on a signal, they stay in range. Because if one of them doesn't answer, they're in trouble, all right?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh, and I suppose the apples ate the cheese," I say.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，我猜是苹果吃了奶酪。”我说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What? No, I didn't," Peeta says.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“什么？不，我没吃。”皮塔说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don't know what ate the cheese," Peeta says slowly and distinctly, as if trying not to lose his temper, "but it wasn't me. I've been down by the stream collecting berries. Would you care for some?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不知道是什么东西吃了奶酪。”皮塔慢慢地、一字一句地说，像是在尽力克制自己不要发脾气。“可不是我，我一直在溪边摘浆果，你想来点吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My father's voice comes back to me. "Not these, Katniss. Never these. They're nightlock. You'll be dead before they reach your stomach."</div>

<div class="line_en">I would actually, but I don't want to relent too soon. I do walk over and look at them. I've never seen this type before. No, I have. But not in the arena. These aren't Rue's berries, although they resemble them. Nor do they match any I learned about in training. I lean down and scoop up a few, rolling them between my fingers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我其实挺想吃的，但我不想这么快就这么算了。我走过去看着这些浆果，我以前从来没见过这个品种。噢，不，我见过，但不是在竞技场。尽管外形很像露露说起的那种浆果，但却不是，也不像我在训练中认识的浆果。我俯身拿起一些，在指间翻弄着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Just then, the cannon fires. I whip around, expecting Peeta to collapse to the ground, but he only raises his eyebrows. The hovercraft appears a hundred yards or so away. What's left of Foxface's emaciated body is lifted into the air. I can see the red glint of her hair in the sunlight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在这时，炮声响了。我一闪身，以为皮塔会应声倒地，可他只抬了下眉毛。直升机在约一百码外的地方出现，把狐狸脸干瘦的身躯吊到空中。我可以看到她的头发在阳光下闪着红色的光。">查看中文翻译</div>
