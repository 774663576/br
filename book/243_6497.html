<div class="line_en">In the end Flimnap realized that his wife was not in love with me, and had not done anything wrong, but he was still angry with me. There were other lords who also disliked me, and together they managed to persuade the King that I was a danger to Lilliput. I knew they were discussing me in private, but I was seriously alarmed when I discovered what they had decided. Luckily, as well as Reldresal, I had another good friend among the King's officials. Late one night he visited me secretly, in order to warn me.</div>

<div class="line_en">I soon discovered that Flimnap, one of the King's highest officials, was my secret enemy. He had always disliked me, although he pretended to like me, but now he began to suspect his wife of visiting me privately, and he became jealous. Of course his wife did visit me, but always with her daughters and other ladies who came for regular afternoon visits. When visitors arrived at my house, I used to bring the coaches and horses inside, and put them carefully on my table. There was a high edge round the table, so that nobody would fall off. I sat in my chair with my face close to the table, and while I was talking to one group of visitors, the others used to drive round the table. I spent many hours like this, in very enjoyable conversation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不久我发现佛林奈浦，国王的一个高级官员，是我的秘密敌人。他早就不喜欢我，虽然他装出喜欢我的样子，现在他怀疑他的妻子私下里来看我而变得妒忌起来。当然他的妻子是拜访过我，可是她总是和她的女儿及其他贵妇一起下午来例访。当来访客人到了家门，我常常把车马搬进去小心地放到我的桌上。桌缘的边很高，所以不会有谁掉下去。我坐在椅子上，脸靠近桌子，在我跟一群客人谈话时，别的人常常在桌上驱马。我像这样花了很多时间，谈话也很愉快。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You know," he began, "that you've had enemies here for some time. Many of the lords are jealous of your great success against Blefuscu, and Flimnap still hates you. They accuse you of crimes against Lilliput, crimes punishable by death!"</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“听着，”他说，“我必须告诉你我所听到的，尽管这样做我是冒着生命危险的。他们指控你在王宫里撒尿，拒绝夺过敌人的所有船只，拒绝摧毁所有的大端派人，私下会见敌方官员，企图访问不来夫斯古以帮助敌人反对利力浦特。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Anyway, the King decided not to kill you, and that's when your friend Reldresal started speaking He agreed you'd made mistakes, but said that a good King should always be generous, as our King is. And he suggested that a suitable punishment would be for you to lose your sight. You'd still be strong enough to work for us, but you wouldn't be able to help the Big-Endians."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“小声点，别让人听见。不管怎么说，国王决定不杀你，那是因为你的朋友瑞颛沙开始说话。他同意你犯了错误，但是又说好的国王，像我们的国王，应该总是大度些。他建议适合你的惩罚是让你失去视力，你将仍然强壮，足以为我们干活，但是你将不能帮助大端派人。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Your enemies were most disappointed with Reldresal's plan," my friend went on. "They said you were a Big-Endian in your heart, and reminded the King how much you cost Lilliput in food and drink. Reldresal spoke again, to suggest saving money by giving you a little less food every day. In this way you'd become ill, and in a few months you'd die. And so they all agreed. In three days Reldresal will be sent to explain your punishment to you. He'll inform you that the King has been very kind to you, and that you're lucky to lose only your eyes. You'll be tied dowu, and very sharp arrows will be shot into your eyes. The King's doctors will make sure that you can no longer see."</div>

<div class="line_en">When I was alone, I thought about the situation for a long time. Perhaps I was wrong, but I could not see that the King was being kind and generous in ordering such an inhuman punishment. What should I do? I could ask for a trial, but I was not confident of the judges' honesty. I could attack the capital and kill all the Lilliputians, but when I remembered the King's past kindness to me, I did not want to do that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当剩下我一个人时，我考虑了很久我的处境。也许我错了。但是我看不出国王下令做如此不人道的处罚有什么仁慈和大度。我该怎么办？我可以请求审判，但是我对法官的诚实没有信心；我可以袭击都城杀死所有的利力浦特人；但是当我想起国王过去对我的仁慈我就不想这样做了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When I arrived, the King of Blefuscu sent two guides to show me the way to the capital. There I met the King, the Queen and the lords and ladies in their coaches. I explained that I had come to visit Blefuscu, as I had been invited. However, I did not say anything about the punishment waiting for me in Lilliput. They welcomed me warmly. That night, as there was no building big enough for me, I slept on the ground, covered by my blanket. It was not as comfortable as my bed in Lilliput, but I did not mind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我到达时，不来夫斯古的国王派了两个向导领我去都城。我见到了国王、王后及王公和贵妇，他们坐在车里。我解释说我是应邀来访问不来夫斯古的，不过我并没有提到利力浦特等着我的处罚。他们热情地欢迎我。那天晚上，因为没有够大的建筑给我住，我只有睡在地上，盖着我的毯子。这没有我在利力浦特的床舒适，不过我不介意。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At last I decided to escape. And so, before Reldresal came to tell me of my punishment, I went to the north of Lilliput, where our ships lay. I took my clothes off and put them into one of the largest warships. I also put a blanket into it. Then I stepped into the sea, and swam to Blefuscu. By pulling the Lilliput warship behind me, I kept my clothes and blanket dry.</div>

<div class="line_en">I was now impatient to start my voyage home, and the King ordered his workmen to repair the boat and prepare everything I needed. I had the meat of one hundred cattle and three hundred sheep to eat on the journey, and I also had some live animals to show to my friends in England.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我现在着急启程回家，国王命令他的工匠修好我的船，准备我需要的一切。我有100只牛和300只羊的肉供我旅途中食用，还有一些活动物以展示给我在英格兰的朋友们。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I did not spend long in Blefuscu. Only three days after my arrival, I noticed a boat in the sea, near the beach. It was a real boat, large enough for me. Perhaps it had been driven there by a storm. I swam out to it and tied ropes to it. Then, with the help of twenty of Blefuscu's ships and three thousand sailors, I pulled it on to the beach. It was not badly damaged, and it was exciting to be able to start planning my journey back to England and my home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我没有在不来夫斯古呆多久。只是3天之后，我注意到海岸附近有一只船，那是一只真正的船，大得足够我用。也许是被风暴驱到那儿的。我游向它，并系上绳子，然后在20只不来夫斯古船和3000名水手的帮助下，我把它拖到岸边。它损坏得还不算严重，能够计划着用它返回英格兰和我自己的家真是太令人兴奋了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">During this time, the King of Lilliput had written to ask the King of Blefuscu to send me back, as a prisoner, so that I could receive my punishment. The King of Blefuscu, however, replied that I was too strong to be taken prisoner, and that I would soon be returning to my country anyway. Secretly he invited me to stay and help him in Blefuscu, but I no longer believed in the promises of kings or their officials, so I politely refused.</div>

<div class="line_en">We arrived home at last on April 13th,1702, and I saw my dear wife and children again. At first I was delighted to be at home again. I earned quite a lot of money by showing my Lilliputian animals to people, and in the end I sold them for a high price. But as the days passed, I became restless, and wanted to see more of the world. And so, only two months later, I said goodbye to my family and sailed away again.</div>

On the third day, September 26th, I saw a sail, and was delighted to discover that it was an English ship, on its way home to England. The captain picked me up, and I told him my story. At first he thought I was mad, but when I took the live animals out of my pocket to show him, he believed me.</div>
