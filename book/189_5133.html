<div class="line_en">It was a chill, damp, windy night, when the Jew: buttoning his great-coat tight round his shrivelled body, and pulling the collar up over his ears so as completely to obscure the lower part of his face: emerged from his den. He paused on the step as the door was locked and chained behind him; and having listened while the boys made all secure, and until their retreating footsteps were no longer audible, slunk down the street as quickly as he could.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="一个值得留意的计划在本章讨论定板。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The house to which Oliver had been conveyed, was in the neighborhood of Whitechapel. The Jew stopped for an instant at the corner of the street; and, glancing suspiciously round, crossed the road, and struck off in the direction of the Spitalfields.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="奥立弗转移以后住进的这所房子位于怀特教堂附近。费金在街角停住，疑虑重重地四下里看了看，然后穿过大路，往斯皮达菲方向奔去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The mud lay thick upon the stones, and a black mist hung over the streets; the rain fell sluggishly down, and everything felt cold and clammy to the touch. It seemed just the night when it befitted such a being as the Jew to be abroad. As he glided stealthily along, creeping beneath the shelter of the walls and doorways, the hideous old man seemed like some loathsome reptile, engendered in the slime and darkness through which he moved: crawling forth, by night, in search of some rich offal for a meal.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="石子路面上积了厚厚的一层烂泥，黑沉沉的雾气笼罩着街道，雨点忽忽悠悠地飘落下来，什么东西摸上去都是冷冰冰、粘乎乎的。这种夜晚似乎只适合于老犹太之类的人外出。他无声无息地向前滑去，在墙壁、门洞的掩护下溜过。这个狰狞可怕的老头看上去像一只令人恶心的蜥蜴观的综合”，对列宁哲学阶段评价不足等），30年代受到苏联，从往来出没的泥泞和暗处爬出来，趁着夜色四出蠕行，想找到一点肥美的臭鱼腐肉吃吃。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Jew was evidently too familiar with the ground he traversed to be at all bewildered, either by the darkness of the night, or the intricacies of the way. He hurried through several alleys and streets, and at length turned into one, lighted only by a single lamp at the farther end. At the door of a house in this street, he knocked; having exchanged a few muttered words with the person who opened it, he walked upstairs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="老犹太显然对这一带十分熟悉，绝不会因沉沉黑夜或者复杂的道路而迷失方向。他快步穿过好几条大街小巷，最后拐进一条街，这里唯一的亮光来自街道尽头的一盏孤灯。老犹太走到当街一所房子跟前，敲了敲门，同开门的人嘀咕几句，便上楼去了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He kept on his course, through many winding and narrow ways, until he reached Bethnal Green; then, turning suddenly off to the left, he soon became involved in a maze of the mean and dirty streets which abound in that close and densely-populated quarter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他不停地走，穿过一条条境蜒曲折的小路，来到贝丝勒尔草地，又突然向左一转，很快就走进一座由龌龊的小街陋巷组成的迷宫，这种迷宫在那个闭塞的人口稠密区比比皆是。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A dog growled as he touched the handle of a room-door; and a man's voice demanded who was there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他刚一碰门把手，一只狗便立刻咆哮起来，一个男人的声音问是谁来了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Only me, Bill; only me, my dear," said the Jew looking in.</div>

<div class="line_en">Apparently, the dog had been somewhat deceived by Mr. Fagin's outer garment; for as the Jew unbuttoned it, and threw it over the back of a chair, he retired to the corner from which he had risen: wagging his tail as he went, to show that he was as well satisfied as it was in his nature to be.</div>

<div class="line_en">The latter recognition was uttered with just enough of embarrassment to imply a doubt of its reception; for Mr. Fagin and his young friend had not met, since she had interfered in behalf of Oliver. All doubts upon the subject, if he had any, were speedily removed by the young lady's behaviour. She took her feet off the fender, pushed back her chair, and bade Fagin draw up his, without saying more about it: for it was a cold night, and no mistake.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后一句招呼的口气有些尴尬，表明他拿不准对方会不会答理，自从南希偏袒奥立弗的事发生以后，费金先生和他的这位女弟子还没见过面。如果他在这个问题上存有一点疑虑的话，也立刻被年轻女子的举动抹去了。她没有多说什么，抬起搁在壁炉挡板上的脚，把自己坐的椅子往后扯了扯，吩咐费金把椅子凑到壁炉边上，这确实是一个寒冷的夜晚。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Nancy quickly brought a bottle from a cupboard, in which there were many: which, to judge from the diversity of their appearance, were filled with several kinds of liquids. Sikes pouring out a glass of brandy, bade the Jew drink it off.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="南希敏捷地从食橱里拿出一个瓶子，里边还有好些这类瓶子，从五花八门的外表来看，盛的全是各种饮料。赛克斯倒了一杯白兰地，要老犹太干了它。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It must be a piercer, if it finds its way through your heart," said Mr. Sikes. "Give him something to drink, Nancy. Burn my body, make haste! It's enough to turn a man ill, to see his lean old carcase shivering in that way, like a ugly ghost just rose from the grave."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“要扎进你的心，非得使锥子才行，”赛克斯先生说，“南希，给他点喝的。真是活见鬼，快一些。瞧他那副干巴巴的老骨头，抖得那样，也真叫人恶心，跟刚从坟墓里爬起来的恶鬼没什么两样。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"What! You're afraid of our getting the better of you, are you?" inquired Sikes, fixing his eyes on the Jew. "Ugh!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“干吗。怕我们抢了你的头彩，是吗？”赛克斯用眼睛死死盯住老犹太，问道。“唔。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">With a hoarse grunt of contempt, Mr. Sikes seized the glass, and threw the remainder of its contents into the ashes: as a preparatory ceremony to filling it again for himself: which he did at once.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="赛克斯先生发出一声沙哑的嘲笑，抓起酒杯，把里边的酒泼进炉灰里，又替自己满满地斟了一杯，作为见面礼，端起来一饮而尽。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“喂，”赛克斯咂了咂嘴，说道，“我可是准备停当了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Jew glanced round the room, as his companion tossed down the second glassful; not in curiousity, for he had seen it often before; but in a restless and suspicious manner habitual to him. It was a meanly furnished apartment, with nothing but the contents of the closet to induce the belief that its occupier was anything but a working man; and with no more suspicious articles displayed to view than two or three heavy bludgeons which stood in a corner, and a "life-preserver" that hung over the chimney-piece.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="趁同伴喝第二杯酒的功夫，费金的目光飞快地在屋里溜了一圈――不是出于好奇，他以前时常光顾这间屋子，而是出于一种习惯，闲不住，而且多疑。这是一间陈设十分简陋的公寓，只有壁橱里的东西表明这间屋子的房客不是一个凭力气吃饭的人。室内一角靠着两三根沉甸甸的大头短棒，一把“护身器”挂在壁炉架上，此外，再也看不出有什么使人油然起疑的东西了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No, he don't," sneered Mr. Sikes. "Or he won't, and that's the same thing. Speak out, and call things by their right names; don't sit there, winking and blinking, and talking to me in hints, as if you warn't the very first that thought about the robbery. Wot d"ye mean?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，他不知道，”赛克斯先生冷冷一笑。“或者说不想知道，都是一回事。说啊，有什么就说什么，别坐在那儿眨巴眼睛，跟我打哑谜，倒好像你不是头一个盘算持这一票似的。你打算如何？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Let "em hear!" said Sikes; "I don't care." But as Mr. Sikes DID care, on reflection, he dropped his voice as he said the words, and grew calmer.</div>

<div class="line_en">"And yet," said the old man, dropping his hands on his knees, "it's a sad thing, my dear, to lose so much when we had set our hearts upon it."</div>

<div class="line_en">A long silence ensued; during which the Jew was plunged in deep thought, with his face wrinkled into an expression of villainy perfectly demoniacal.

<div class="line_cn" title="一阵漫长难熬的沉默随之而起。老犹太陷入了沉思，他面部扭曲，一副奸诈邪恶的样子。赛克斯不时偷偷瞧他一眼。南希像是生怕招惹这个人室抢劫犯，管自坐在一旁，两眼直瞪瞪地盯住火，仿佛刚才发生的一切她都听不见似的。">查看中文翻译</div>

The crib's barred up at night like a jail; but there's one part we can crack, safe and softly."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那好，”赛克斯带着几分轻蔑甩开老犹太的手，说道，“你高兴什么时候动手就什么时候动手。前天晚上我跟托比翻过花园围墙，试了一下门窗上的嵌板。这家子到了夜里就关门闭户，跟大牢似的。不过有个地方我们能砸开，又安全又轻巧。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“啊呜。”赛克斯骤然打住，跟着又嚷了起来，这当儿，南希姑娘难得地摇了摇头，突然回头看了一眼，又立刻转向费金。“管它是什么地方。离开我，你办不了这事，我心里有数，跟你打交道，还是小心为妙。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Never mind wot it is!" replied Sikes. "I want a boy, and he musn't be a big "un. Lord!" said Mr. Sikes, reflectively, "if I'd only got that young boy of Ned, the chimbley-sweeper's! He kept him small on purpose, and let him out by the job. But the father gets lagged; and then the Juvenile Delinquent Society comes, and takes the boy away from a trade where he was earning money, teaches him to read and write, and in time makes a "prentice of him. And so they go on," said Mr. Sikes, his wrath rising with the recollection of his wrongs, "so they go on; and, if they'd got money enough (which it's a Providence they haven't,) we shouldn't have half a dozen boys left in the whole trade, in a year or two."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“管它是什么。”赛克斯回答，“我需要一个孩子，个头还不能太大，天啦。”赛克斯先生若有所思。“我要是能把扫烟囱师傅勒德的那个小家伙搞到手就好啦。他存心不让那孩子长个，好让他干这一行。那孩子本来在这一行已经开始挣钱了，可作爸爸的给关了起来，再往后，少年犯罪教化会把孩子带走了，教他读书写字，早晚要培养他当学徒什么的，他们老是那样，”赛克斯先生想起自己蒙受的损失，火气又上来了，“没有个完。要是他们得到足够的资金（谢天谢地，他们资金不够），只消一两年的功夫，整个这一行我们连半打孩子也凑不齐了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
