<div class="line_en">Ullman seemed truly warm toward Danny only, but Wendy had experienced that before. Danny seemed to be a child for people who ordinarily held W. C. Fields' sentiments about children. He bent a little from the waist and offered Danny his hand. Danny shook it formally, without a smile.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="厄尔曼看来只是对丹尼表现出了真正的热情，但温迪对此已经习以为常了。丹尼一向是人见人爱的那种孩子。厄尔曼弯了弯腰，向丹尼伸出了手。丹尼郑重其事地握了握，脸上没有笑容。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm happy to meet you both," Ullman said. "How old are you, Danny?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“很高兴认识二位，”厄尔曼说。“几岁了，丹尼？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ullman was waiting for them just inside the wide, old-fashioned front doors. He shook hands with Jack and nodded coolly at Wendy, perhaps noticing the way heads turned when she came through into the lobby, her golden hair spilling across the shoulders of the simple navy dress. The hem of the dress stopped a modest two inches above the knee, but you didn't have to see more to know they were good legs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="厄尔曼在宽大的老式正门的里侧迎候他们。他和杰克握了握手，对温迪冷冷地点了点头，也许觉察到了她走进大厅时人们纷纷回头的情景。她那一头金发披散在朴素的水手领上，裙摆不高不低，在膝盖以上两英寸的地方，但这足以让你知道那是一双秀腿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Sir, yet." Ullman smiled and glanced at Jack. "He's well mannered."</div>

<div class="line_en">"And Mrs. Torrance." He offered the same little bow, and for a bemused instant Wendy thought he would kiss her hand. She half-offered it and he did take it, but only for a moment, clasped in both of his. His hands were small and dry and smooth, and she guessed that he powdered them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“托兰斯夫人。”厄尔曼又弯了弯腰，温迪一时有些不知所措，以为他要吻她的手。她迟疑地伸出手，他真接了过去，但只是握了握，很快就放开了。他的手小巧、干爽、滑腻，她猜一定是上了粉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the background was the constant hum of conversation, the muted ding! of the silver-plated bell beside the cash register as one of the two clerks on duty struck it, the slightly impatient call of "Front, please!" It brought back strong, warm memories of her honeymoon in New York with Jack, at the Beekman Tower. For the first time she let herself believe that this might be exactly what the three of them needed: a season together away from the world, a sort of family honeymoon. She smiled affectionately down at Danny, who was goggling around frankly at everything. Another limo, as gray as a banker's vest, had pulled up out front.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大厅里混响着一片嗡嗡的说话声，当班的职员敲击现金出纳机后面的镀银铃铛时发出的叮叮声，略显烦躁的“下一位，请”。这勾起了她对蜜月的强烈而又温馨的回忆，她和杰克在纽约的比克曼塔饭店…此时，她第一次让自己相信，这也许正是他们3人所需要的：一起住上几个月，与世隔绝，过一个家庭蜜月。她慈爱地看着丹尼，他正在那儿毫无顾忌地东瞧瞧、西看看。又一辆银灰色的饭店班车开到了大厅前面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">To their right, down toward a pair of tall double doors that were pulled closed and roped off, there was an old-fashioned fireplace now blazing with birch logs. Three nuns sat on a sofa that was drawn up almost to the hearth itself. They were talking and smiling with their bags stacked up to either side, waiting for the check-out line to thin a little. As Wendy watched them they burst into a chord of tinkling, girlish laughter. She felt a smile touch her own lips; not one of them could be under sixty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们的右边，在通往一对紧闭的、前面拉着一条绳子的双扇大门的路上，有一个老式壁炉，炉膛里的桦木烧得正旺。3个修女坐在一张沙发上——沙发都快拖到炉膛里去了——行李包堆在两侧。她们在那里说说笑笑，等待着结账的人少下去。正当温迪看她们的时候，她们爆发出了一阵清脆的少女般的笑声。温迪自己也笑了笑——她们谁也不止60岁了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The lobby was a bustle of activity. Almost every one of the old-fashioned high-backed chairs was taken. Bellboys shuttled in and out with suitcases and there was a line at the desk, which was dominated by a huge brass cash register. The BankAmericard and Master Charge decals on it seemed jarringly anachronistic.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大厅里一片忙碌。差不多每张老式靠背椅都坐上了人。侍者拎着箱子进进出出；出纳台前排着一支长队，那儿最醒目的是一台巨大的铜质现金出纳机，机器上贴着美国银行信用卡和万事达信用卡的图案，显得十分不协调。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“呃，什么事？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Thank you, Mr. Ullman." The clerk crossed back to the desk, where a dreadnought of a woman bundled into a long fur coat and what looked like a black feather boa was remonstrating loudly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“谢谢你，厄尔曼先生。”职员回出纳台去了。那儿站着一个壮实的女人，裹在一件长长的裘皮大衣里，脖子上围着一条像黑蟒一样的东西，正在大发雷霆。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"How fortunate," Ullman said. "I'd like to take the three of you on a tour of the place a little later, and of course Dick Hallorann wants to show Mrs. Torrance the Overlook's kitchen. But I'm afraid --" One of the clerks came over and almost tugged his forelock.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“运气不错，”厄尔曼说。“我很乐意过一会儿带你们参观参观，当然，迪克—哈洛伦也要带托兰斯夫人去看看饭店的厨房。可是我担心——”一位职员愁眉苦脸地走了过来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's Mrs. Brant," the clerk said uncomfortably. "She refuses to pay her bill with anything but her American Express card. I told her we stopped taking American Express at the end of the season last year, but she won't…" His eyes shifted to the Torrance family, then back to Ullman. He shrugged.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“布兰特夫人，”职员浑身不自在地说。“除了运通卡，她拒绝用其他任何方式付账。我告诉她我们去年就不接受运通卡了，但她不…”他把目光转向杰克一家，接着又转回到厄尔曼，耸了耸肩。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I have been coming to the Overlook Hotel since 1955," she was telling the smiling, shrugging clerk. "I continued to come even after my second husband died of a stroke on that tiresome roque court -- I told him the sun was too hot that day -- and I have never… I repeat: never… paid with anything but my American Express credit card. Call the police if you like! Have them drag me away! I will still refuse to pay with anything but my American Express credit card. I repeat:…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“从1955年起我就是这里的常客了，”她对耸着肩膀满脸陪笑的职员说。“甚至在我的第二个丈夫死在那个讨厌的槌球场之后，我也是每年必来的——我告诉他那天太热了——我还从来没有…再说一遍：从来没有…用运通信用卡以外的任何东西付过账。想叫警察，随你便好了！让他们把我带走好了！我还是只用运通卡付账。我再说一遍…”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Excuse me," Mr. Ullman said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对不起，失陪了，”厄尔曼说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They watched him cross the lobby, touch Mrs. Brant's elbow deferentially, and spread his hands and nod when she turned her tirade on him. He listened sympathetically, nodded again, and said something in return. Mrs. Brant smiled triumphantly, turned to the unhappy desk clerk, and said loudly: "Thank God there is one employee of this hotel who hasn't become an utter Philistinel" She allowed Ullman, who barely came to the bulky shoulder of her fur coat, to take her arm and lead her away, presumably to his inner office.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们眼看他穿过大厅，礼貌地碰了碰布兰特夫人的肘弯，当她把谴责的矛头转到他身上时，他就摊摊手，点点头。他同情地听着，又点了点头，说了些什么。布兰特夫人脸上露出了胜利的微笑，回头对着那个倒霉的职员大声说：“谢天谢地，这家饭店还有一个人没变成十足的市侩！”她让厄尔曼——他明白她那昂贵的裘皮大衣意味着什么——挽着她的胳膊，带她到经理办公室去了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"But he didn't like that lady," Danny said immediately. "He was just pretending to like her." Jack grinned down at him. "I'm sure that's true, doc. But flattery is the stuff that greases the wheels of the world."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可他并不喜欢那个女人，”丹尼紧接着说。“他只是假装喜欢她。”杰克对他笑了笑。“我想是的，博士。可是奉承往往管用。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What's flattery?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“什么是奉承？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Flattery," Wendy told him, "is when your daddy says he likes my new yellow slacks even if he doesn't or when he says I don't need to take off five pounds."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“奉承，”温迪告诉他。“就是你爸爸尽管不喜欢，但还是说他喜欢我新买的黄色休闲裤，或者说我用不着减肥。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Something very like that."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“差不多。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You look very handsome," she said, and then they laughed again, Wendy putting a hand over her mouth. Danny still didn't understand, but it was okay. They were loving each other. Danny thought this place reminded her of somewhere else (the beak-man place) where she had been happy. He wished he liked it as well as she did, but he kept telling himself over and over that the things Tony showed him didn't always come true. He would be careful. He would watch for something called Redrum. But he would not say anything unless he absolutely had to. Because they were happy, they had been laughing, and there were no bad thoughts.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你真帅气。”她说，他们又哈哈大笑起来，温迪用一只手捂住了嘴。丹尼还是不明白，但这也很好。他们相爱着。丹尼想，这里使她想起了另外一个地方（叫比克曼？），在那个地方她过得很愉快。他希望自己也像她一样喜欢这儿，他一次次告诉自己，托尼给他看的东西并不是都会变成真的。他会小心的。他会提防那种叫REDRUM的东西。但是，除非绝对必要，他什么都不会说出来。因为他们很开心，一直在笑，也没想什么不好的事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Ullman didn't waste much flattery on me," Jack said. "Come on over by the window, you guys. I feel conspicuous standing out here in the middle with my denim jacket on. I honest to God didn't think there'd be anybody much here on closing day. Guess I was wrong."</div>

<div class="line_en">But Danny didn't think it was particularly gorgeous. He didn't like heights; they made him dizzy. Beyond the wide front porch, which ran the length of the hotel, a beautifully manicured lawn (there was a putting green on the right) sloped away to a long, rectangular swimming pool. A CLOSED sign stood on a little tripod at one end of the pool; closed was one sign he could read by himself, along with Stop, Exit, Pizza, and a few others.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但丹尼并不认为眼前的景色特别漂亮。他不喜欢高处，这使他感到晕眩。宽宽的饭店前廊外面，一片修剪整齐的草坪（右边有一块高尔夫轻击区）沿斜坡而下，接着一个长长的长方形游泳池。一张牌子竖在游泳池一端的小三角架上，上面写着：暂停使用。这是他能读懂的几个标牌之一，另外还有“行人止步”、“出口”、“比萨饼”等等。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“是一种游戏，”杰克说。“有点儿像槌球游戏，在石子场地上玩，而不是像槌球那样在草地上玩。石子场地有边儿，像张大台球桌。丹尼，这是一种非常古老的游戏。有时这里还举行比赛。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Danny, whose eyes were sharp, made out a rabbit, a dog, a horse, a cow, and a trio of bigger ones that looked like frolicking lions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你喜欢动物吗？”温迪问。“那叫树篱动物。”通往短柄槌球场的小路那边，树篱被修剪成了各种各样的动物。丹尼眼睛好使，看出了一只兔子，一条狗，一匹马，一头奶牛，还有三个大家伙看上去像嬉戏的狮子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mrs. Brant came out of the inner office looking vindicated. A few moments later two bellboys, struggling with eight suitcases between them, followed her as best they could as she strode triumphantly out the door. Danny watched through the window as a man in a gray uniform and a hat like a captain in the Army brought her long silver car around to the door and got out. He tipped his cap to her and ran around to open the trunk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布兰特夫人带着满脸扬眉吐气的神色从经理办公室走了出来。过了一会儿，她仰首阔步地走出了大门，两个侍者使出了吃奶的力气拎着8个箱子跟在后面。丹尼往窗外望去，看见一个男人——穿一身灰制服，戴一顶帽子，看上去像个陆军上尉——把她那辆长长的银色轿车开到门前，下了车，向她脱帽致敬，然后跑去开行李箱。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">(I'd like to get into his pants)</div>

<div class="line_en">The man in the gray uniform closed the trunk and walked back to help her into the car. Danny watched closely to see if she would say anything about his pants, but she only smiled and gave him a dollar bill -- a tip. A moment later she was guiding the big silver car down the driveway.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="灰制服男人关好行李箱，又回来扶她上车。丹尼仔细盯着，看她会不会说些关于他裤子的话，但她只是笑了笑，给了她一美元——小费。不一会儿，她就开着银色轿车上了路。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And in one of those flashes that sometimes came, he got a complete thought from her, one that floated above the confused, low-pitched babble of emotions and colors that he usually got in crowded places.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="刹那间，丹尼捕捉到了她的一个完整的想法。在人声鼎沸的地方，他接收到的通常都是杂乱无章的情感和色彩，它们混合成一片低沉的嗡嗡声，难辨彼此，但她的这个想法却漂浮在这一切之上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He thought about asking his mother why Mrs. Brant might want the car-man's pants, and decided against it. Sometimes questions could get you in a whole lot of trouble. It had happened to him before.</div>

<div class="line_en">She was looking rather sharply at the man in the gray uniform, who was supervising the loading. Why would she want to get that man's pants? Was she cold, even with that long fur coat on? And if she was that cold, why hadn't she just put on some pants of her own? His mommy wore pants just about all winter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她盯着正监督装车的灰制服男人，目光灼灼逼人。她为什么想钻到那个人的裤子里去？难道她穿着那件长裘皮大衣还觉得冷吗？要是她真的那么冷，那她为什么自己不多穿几条裤子呢？妈妈差不多整个冬天都穿裤子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So instead he squeezed in between them on the small sofa they were sharing and watched all the people check out at the desk. He was glad his mommy and daddy were happy and loving each other, but he couldn't help being a little worried. He couldn't help it.</div>
