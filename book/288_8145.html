<div class="line_en">After breakfast I was sitting by the river, and thinking, when George said,'Perhaps, when you've rested enough, you could help to wash the plates and things. 'so I cleaned the pan with some wood and grass -- and George's wet shirt.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then we started to move up the river again, past Old Windsor, which is very pretty. After that, the river is not very interesting until you get to Boveney. George and I were towing the boat then. As we were passing Datchet, George asked me if I remembered our first trip up the river. On that trip we reached Datchet at ten o'clock at night. All we wanted to do was to eat and go to bed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后我们又沿着河上路了，经过了古老的温莎镇那一片风景优美的地方。过了那儿风景就单调得很，一无可取，一直到布文奈。我和乔治一起拉着纤。当我们经过达切特时，乔治问我还记不记得第一次在河上旅游的情景。那一次，我们晚上十点钟才到达切特，大家只想吃点东西然后赶快去睡觉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was one Saturday in August. There was George, and Harris, and me. We were tired and hungry. When we got to Datchet, we took out of the boat the basket of food, the two bags, and the coats and things. Then we began to look for somewhere to stay. We passed a very pretty little hotel, but there were no roses round the door. I wanted somewhere with roses round the door. I do not know why. Anyway, I said,'Oh, we don't want to go there. Let's look for a little hotel with roses round the door. '</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那是八月份的一个星期六，同游的还是我们三个。那会儿又饿又累，到达切特的时候，我们从船里拿出一篮子食物，两个包，外套和其它一些东西。接着大家就想找地方安顿下来。我们经过一家很漂亮的小旅店，只是门口旁边没有玫瑰花。我偏偏想找一家门口有玫瑰的，也不明白怎么会如此心血来潮。我说：“漫着，我们别进去！咱们再找找其它旅店，看看有没有门口长满玫瑰的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We decided to have cold meat for lunch. Then, after that, George brought out a tin of fruit. We love tinned fruit, all three of us. We looked at the picture on the tin. We thought about the fruit. We imagined the taste of it. We smiled at each other, and Harris got out a spoon. Then we looked for the tinopener. We took everything out of the big basket.

<div class="line_en">Then Harris tried to open the tin with a little knife, and he cut himself badly. George tried with some scissors. The scissors flew up, and nearly hit him in the eye.

<div class="line_en">Then we all got angry. We took that tin, and we put it on the grass by the river. Harris went into a field and got a big, sharp stone. I got a long, thick piece of wood. George held the tin, and Harris put the sharp end of his stone against the top of it. I took the piece of wood, and held it high in the air. Then I brought it down as hard as I could.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们大家气得发疯。我们把罐头拿到岸上放在草地上。哈里斯找来一块又大又尖的石头，我拿了一根又长又粗的木头。乔治拿着罐头，哈里斯把石头尖对准了罐头的顶盖，我高高举起木头，使足了力量，狠命砸下去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was one big line across the top of the tin that looked like a mouth. It seemed to be laughing at us, and this made us very angry. So Harris ran at it, and picked it up. He threw it, as hard as he could, into the middle of the river. As it went down into the water, we shouted awful things at it. Then we got into the boat, and we left that place, and did not stop until we reached Maidenhead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罐头顶上有一条粗粗的横线，好象咧着的嘴，冲着我们狞笑。我们越发怒气冲冲。哈里斯狠狠冲过去，一把抓起来，使劲扔出去，扔到河中心。我们看着它沉下去，用很难听的话骂它，然后上了船，离开那个鬼地方，直到梅登黑德才停脚。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We beat it until it was long and thin. We beat it until it was square. We hit it with the wood until it was every shape there is -- but we could not make a hole in it.

Then the three of us sat round that tin on the grass, and we looked at it.</div>

<div class="line_en">There were no other people on the river, except for three old men. They were sitting in a boat, and they were fishing. As we got nearer, we could see that they were old.

It was very beautiful, and we felt that we were sailing into some strange land.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="河上除了三个老头儿，再没有其他人影。他们坐在船上钓鱼。我们靠上去的时候，才看清楚他们都上了年纪，而且还特别一本正经的样子，眼睛一眨不眨地盯着钓鱼线。太阳快落山了，向水面射出万道灿烂的金光，美不胜收，我们也仿佛驶进了一片神奇的国土。">查看中文翻译</div>

But then, from the words which rose on the evening air, we understood that we were near people. We also understood that those people were not happy. We had knocked those three old men from their seats, and they were all lying on the bottom of their boat. They were trying to stand up and they were picking fish off themselves. As they worked, they shouted unkind things about us -- not just the usual things, but special things about us, and about our families.</div>
