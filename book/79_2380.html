<div class="line_en">The cook didn't conform to Wendy's image of the typical resort hotel kitchen personage at all. To begin with, such a personage was called a chef, nothing so mundane as a cook -- cooking was what she did in her apartment kitchen when she threw all the leftovers into a greased Pyrex casserole dish and added noodles.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="饭店厨师的模样与温迪想像中的这类地方的典型司厨人员形象相去甚远。首先，这样的人叫厨师，不像“做饭的”那样平凡——所谓做饭，就是她在自家厨房里的那些作为：把残羹剩菜倒在一个油腻腻的耐热玻璃盘里，再加些面条。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Further, the culinary wizard of such a place as the Overlook, which advertised in the resort section of the New York Sunday Times, should be small, rotund, and pasty-faced (rather like the Pillsbury Dough-Boy); he should have a thin pencil-line mustache like a forties musical comedy star, dark eyes, a French accent, and a detestable personality.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="再则，像远望饭店这样的地方——在《纽约时报》周日版的旅游胜地版面上打广告的——烹调大师应该是矮墩墩、胖乎乎、脸蛋儿白净的；他应该像40年代的喜剧明星那样留一条细细的“一”字须，还应该有一双黑眼睛，带法国口音，有着龌龊的性格。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hallorann had the dark eyes and that was all. He was a tall black man with a modest afro that was beginning to powder white. He had a soft southern accent and he laughed a lot, disclosing teeth too white and too even to be anything but 1950 -- vintage Sears and Roebuck dentures. Her own father had had a pair, which he called Roebuckers, and from time to time he would push them out at her comically at the supper table… always, Wendy remembered now, when her mother was out in the kitchen getting something else or on the telephone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈洛伦的确有一双黑眼睛，但也仅此而已。他是个高个儿黑人，头发已经开始发白。他说话带柔和的南方口音，很喜欢笑，一笑就露出满口的牙齿——洁白整齐得一眼就可以看出是假牙。她父亲也有这样一副，常在晚餐桌上顶出来逗她，样子十分滑稽…温迪记得，每次都是趁她母亲去厨房取东西或忙着接电话的时候。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Danny had stared up at this black giant in blue serge, and then had smiled when Hallorann picked him up easily, set him in the crook of his elbow, and said: "You ain't gonna stay up here all winter."</div>

<div class="line_en">"No, you're gonna come down to St. Pete's with me and learn to cook and go out on the beach every damn evenin watchin for crabs. Right?" Danny giggled delightedly and shook his head no. Hallorann set him down.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，你跟我去圣皮特学做饭，每天晚上到海滩抓螃蟹。好吗？”丹尼乐得咯咯直笑，摇了摇头。哈洛伦把他放了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"If you're gonna change your mind," Hallorann said, bending over him gravely, "you better do it quick. Thirty minutes from now and I'm in my car. Two and a half hours after that, I'm sitting at Gate 32, Concourse B, Stapleton International Airport, in the mile-high city of Denver, Colorado. Three hours after that, I'm rentin a car at the Miama Airport and on my way to sunny St. Pete's, waiting to get iota my swimtrunks and just laaafin up my sleeve at anybody stuck and caught in the snow.

<div class="line_en">"We think he'll do," Jack said, and offered his hand. Hallorann took it. "I'm Jack Torrance. My wife Winnifred. Danny you've met."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我想是的，”杰克说，伸出一只手。哈洛伦握了握。“我叫杰克—托兰斯。这是我妻子温尼弗雷德。丹尼你已经认识了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，愉快的相识。夫人，称你温妮还是弗雷德？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Okay. That's better than the other two, I think. Right this way. Mr. Unman wants you to have the tour, the tour you'll get." He shook his head and said under his breath: "And won't I be glad to see the last of him." Hallorann commenced to tour them around the most immense kitchen Wendy had ever seen in her life. It was sparkling clean. Every surface was coaxed to a high gloss. It was more than just big; it was intimidating. She walked at Hallorann's side while Jack, wholly out of his element, hung back a little with Danny. A long wallboard hung with cutting instruments which went all the way from paring knives to two-handed cleavers hung beside a four-basin sink. There was a breadboard as big as their Boulder apartment's kitchen table. An amazing array of stainless-steel pots and pans hung from floor to ceiling, covering one whole wall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好的。比我说的那两个都好。这边来，厄尔曼先生想让你们参观参观，我这就带你们去。”他摇摇头，压低声音说：“那家伙我多看一眼都不乐意。”哈洛伦开始领着他们周游温迪平生见到过的最大的厨房。厨房里亮堂堂的，无一处不是经过精心擦洗、光洁如新。说它宽敞还不够，应该说它大得惊人。温迪跟在哈洛伦身边，杰克心不在焉地和丹尼跟在后面。一条长长的护墙板上挂满了各式各样的刀具；不锈钢的锅锅罐罐从地板一直挂到天花板，占了整整一面墙，那阵势真是令人眼花缭乱。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm a Wendy," she said, smiling.</div>

<div class="line_en">Smallest, she thought dismally, looking at it There were twelve burners, two regular ovens and a Dutch oven, a heated well on top in which you could simmer sauces or bake beans, a broiler, and a warmer -- plus a million dials and temperature gauges.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最小！她看着那个炉子，感到有些沮丧。这个炉子上有12个燃气头，两个普通烤箱，一个荷兰烤箱，一个可以煨沙司或焙豆子的加热罐，一副烤架，一个保温锅——还有一排排的表盘和温度计。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Don't let it get you down," Hallorann said. "It's big, but it's still only a kitchen. Most of this stuff you'll never even have to touch. Keep it clean, that's all I ask. Here's the stove I'd be using, if I was you. There are three of them in all, but this is the smallest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“别让它吓着你，”哈洛伦说。“确实不小，可毕竟还只是间厨房。大多数东西你碰都没有必要去碰。我唯一的要求是保持整洁。假如我是你，我会用这个炉子的，一共有三个，这一个最小。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"All gas," Hallorann said. "You've cooked with gas before, Wendy?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"I love gas," he said, and turned on one of the burners. Blue flame popped into life and he adjusted it down to a faint glow with a delicate touch. "I like to be able to see the flame you're cookin with. You see where all the surface burner switches are?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我喜欢用煤气，”他说，随手打开了一个燃气头。蓝色的火苗噗地冒了出来，他灵巧地一调，火苗只剩下了一点微光。“做饭时我喜欢看到火苗。你都知道燃气头开关在哪儿吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Hallorann roared. "Go right ahead, if you like. I left a list of everything edible over by the sink. You see it?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈洛伦哈哈大笑起来。“愿意的话，就表演下去吧。我在洗碗池那边放了一份食品清单。你看见了吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Here it is, Mommy!" Danny brought over two sheets of paper, written closely on both sides.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“在这儿，妈妈！”丹尼拿过来两张纸，每张正反两面都写得密密麻麻的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"A TV dinner in each one," Wendy said, and laughed weakly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“在每个上面都表演一次，”温迪说，小声地笑了出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Good boy," Hallorann said, taking it from him and ruffling his hair. "You sure you don't want to come to Florida with me, my boy? Learn to cook the sweetest shrimp creole this side of paradise?" Danny put his hands over his mouth and giggled and retreated to his father's side.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好孩子，”哈洛伦说，从丹尼手中接过清单，顺便搓了搓他的头发。“小伙子，你真的不想跟我去佛罗里达啦？不去人间天堂学做好吃的什锦虾啦？”丹尼两手捂着嘴巴咯咯地笑，往爸爸身边靠去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You three folks could eat up here for a year, I guess," Hallorann said. "We got a cold-pantry, a walk-in freezer, all sorts of vegetable bins, and two refrigerators. Come on and let me show you." For the next ten minutes Hallorann opened bins and doors, disclosing food in such amounts as Wendy had never seen before. The food supplies amazed her but did not reassure her as much as she might have thought: the Donner Party kept recurring to her, not with thoughts of cannibalism (with all this food it would indeed be a long time before they were reduced to such poor rations as each other), but with the reinforced idea that this was indeed a serious business: when snow fell, getting out of here would not be a matter of an hour's drive to Sidewinder but a major operation. They would sit up here in this deserted grand hotel, eating the food that had been left them like creatures in a fairy tale and listening to the bitter wind around their snowbound eaves. In Vermont, when Danny had broken his arm (when Jack broke Danny's arm) she had called the emergency Medix squad, dialing the number from the little card attached to the phone. They had been at the house only ten minutes later.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这里的东西足够你们三个吃上整整一年，”哈洛伦说。“这儿有一个糕点室，一个冷藏室，各种各样的蔬菜箱，两台冰箱。来，我带你们看一看。”接下来的10分钟，哈洛伦一会儿打开这只箱子，一会儿打开那扇门，展示里面存放的东西。温迪还从未见到过这么多的食品，但这并未打消她的顾虑。她老是想起唐纳登山队，但这引起的不是自相残食（有了这些吃的，他们在落到那一步之前确实需要很长的时间）的联想，而是一个根深蒂固、事关重大的想法：下雪后，从这儿出去可不像驱车一个小时到塞德温得那么轻松，而是一次大规模的军事行动。他们将呆在这个荒寂的大饭店，像童话中的人物一样吃着留给他们的食物，倾听着寒风在积雪覆盖的屋檐上呜咽。在佛蒙特，丹尼折断胳膊（不，是杰克折断丹尼的胳膊）那次，她在电话机的小卡片上找到号码，打电话叫急救车，他们10分钟就到了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There were more wonders in the cold-pantry. A hundred boxes of dried milk (Hallorann advised her gravely to buy fresh milk for the boy in Sidewinder as long as it was feasible), five twelve-pound bags of sugar, a gallon jug of blackstrap molasses, cereals, glass jugs of rice, macaroni, spaghetti; ranked cans of fruit and fruit salad; a bushel of fresh apples that scented the whole room with autumn; dried raisins, prunes, and apricots ("You got to be regular if you want to be happy," Hallorann said, and pealed laughter at the coldpantry ceiling, where one old-fashioned light globe hung down on an iron chain); a deep bin filled with potatoes; and smaller caches of tomatoes, onions, turnips, squashes, and cabbages.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“真可惜，”哈洛伦说，带着他们向通往饭店餐厅的那扇宽大的转门走去。“很久以前，他们家挺有钱。是沃森的祖父或曾祖父——记不得是他们中的哪一个了——建的这家饭店。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What happened?" Wendy asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“后来怎么了？”温迪问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, they couldn't make it go," Hallorann said. "Watson will tell you the whole story -- twice a day, if you let him. The old man got a bee in his bonnet about the place. He let it drag him down, I guess. He had two boys and one of them was killed in a riding accident on the grounds while the hotel was still a-building. That would have been 1908 or '09. The old man's wife died of the flu, and then it was just the old man and his youngest son. They ended up getting took back on as caretakers in the same hotel the old man had built."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“呃，他们经营不下去了，”哈洛伦说。“如果你们让沃森讲，他会把整个故事都告诉你们的——一天两遍。那老头很看好这地方。我想，他算是栽在这个地方了。他有两个儿子，其中一个在饭店的工地上骑马摔死了，时间大约在1908年或1909年。老头的妻子得肺炎死了，这样就只剩下了老头和他的小儿子。后来，他俩都做了这家饭店的看守人。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Hallorann laughed derisively. "Mr. Ullman, that's who. That was his bright idea last fall. I put it to him, I said: `What if we all get up here next May, Mr. Ullman, and I serve the traditional opening night dinner -- which just happens to be salmon in a very nice sauce -- and everybody gits sick and the doctor comes and says to you, "Ullman, what have you been doing up here? You've got eighty of the richest folks in America suffering from rat poisoning!</div>

<div class="line_en">"He plugged his finger into a light socket by mistake and that was the end of him," Hallorann said. "Sometime in the early thirties before the Depression closed this place down for ten years.

The long main room was beginning to take on the quiet, deserted look that Jack supposed they would become familiar with soon enough. The high-backed chairs were empty. The nuns who had been sitting by the fire were gone, and the fire itself was down to a bed of comfortably glowing coals. Wendy glanced out into the parking lot and saw that all but a dozen cars had disappeared.</div>
