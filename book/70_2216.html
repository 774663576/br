<div class="line_en">"You've been awfully nice," Ella called. "Thank you for a wonderful evening. I loved it. Every second." Then she ran through the garden, to the terrace, and up the stone steps. She found herself standing in front of the door to the gallery where their walk had begun. Moving through the doors, she disappeared into the darkness of the gallery.</div>

"I wanted to say, Your Highness, that your son, Kit, is the most lovely person I ever met. So good and brave. I hope you know how much he loves you."

<div class="line_en">One of the footmen leaned against the side of the carriage, trying to catch a fly. As soon as he spotted Ella, he frantically motioned to the coachman, the fly forgotten. With a snap of the reins, the coachman started moving the carriage and Ella slipped inside. Then the carriage was off, the four noble horses racing into the night.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的一名侍从靠在马车旁，正在捕捉苍蝇，但他一看见瑞拉就兴奋地向马车夫招手，完全忘记了苍蝇这回事。车夫猛地一拉缰绳，马车动起来了，瑞拉迅速钻进了车里。四匹高贵的马撒开腿拉着马车冲进夜色中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Letting out a deep breath, Ella finally looked back. She could just make out the prince standing on the steps. In one hand, he held her glass slipper. But it wasn't the loss of the shoe that hurt; it was the expression on his face that broke Ella's heart. Kit looked confused and sad. And it was all her fault.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="瑞拉长长地舒了一口气，最后回头望了一眼。她还能看见站在台阶上的王子，一只手上拿着她落下的水晶鞋。其实，丢了鞋瑞拉并不伤心，可王子脸上的表情却让她心碎。基特看起来惶惑又难过，而这全是她的错。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ella ran faster than she had ever run before. Finally, she found herself at the top of the staircase leading down to the palace courtyard. She spotted her carriage nearby. With a sigh of relief, she ran down the stairs. Suddenly, she felt one of her glass slippers, the one that had flown off on the swing, slide off her foot once more. She was just about to fetch it when she saw a group of guards arrive at the top of the stairs. With one last sad look at her pretty shoe, Ella ran the rest of the way down the stairs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="瑞拉从未像现在跑得这样快。终于她来到通向王宫大院的楼梯上，看见自己的马车就在附近。她如释重负地舒一口气，跑下楼梯。忽然，她发现自己穿着的水晶鞋中有一只——就是她荡秋千时飞出去的那只——又从她脚上滑了下来。她想取回鞋子，却看到一群侍卫站到了楼梯上。瑞拉悲伤地看了她那漂亮的鞋子最后一眼，急匆匆离开了楼梯。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A short distance behind, unaware of any of these odd changes, the guards continued their pursuit. Among them were the Grand Duke and the Captain. They both wanted to catch the mystery princess but for different reasons. The Grand Duke wanted to expose her for the fake he thought she was, while the Captain simply wanted to make Kit happy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在马车后方不远处，侍卫们还在坚持不懈地追赶着，对这些异常的变化一无所知。公爵和侍卫长也在追赶马车的队列里，他们都想抓住这位神秘的公主，却是出于不同的原因：公爵打算揭发她假冒的公主身份，而侍卫长则单纯地希望基特能快乐。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As the carriage sped out the palace gates, Ella heard the bells tolling the midnight hour. She also heard the sound of hoofbeats and knew that the guards were in pursuit. That meant Kit didn't want her to go. But she couldn't let him find her. Not now, not when the magic was about to end.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在马车飞快地跑出王宫大门时，瑞拉听见午夜的钟声响起了。她还听见阵阵马蹄声，她知道侍卫们正在追赶她。这意味着基特不想让她走，可她不能让他找到自己。不，不是这个时候，不能在魔法即将消失的时候。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The bell tolled again. Ella leaned out the window and saw the horses' tails begin to transform back into mouse tails. Around her, the walls of the carriage started to turn orange. As the persistent bell tolled loudly, the coachman's nose grew back into a beak, and he let out an anxious honk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="钟声又响了。瑞拉把身子探出窗外，看见马儿的尾巴开始变回老鼠尾巴了。在她周围，马车的内侧也开始变为橙色。钟声还在固执地、响亮地继续着，马车夫的鼻子变回了鸟喙，发出了焦虑的嘎嘎声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As a cloud passed over the moon, Ella's carriage clattered over a bridge, bringing them farther from their pursuers and closer to home. But they still had a ways to go, and as the ninth bell tolled, the carriage began to resemble a pumpkin, its elegant symmetry replaced with a bulbous shape and a stub protruding from the top. At the tenth bell, the horses finally disappeared, replaced by the four mice, who let out frightened squeaks as the pumpkin carriage rolled on. The goose fell to the road, honking loudly before shaking himself off and flying the rest of the way home. And as the eleventh and twelfth bells tolled, the spell was broken.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一片云朵拂过月亮，瑞拉的马车正咔嗒咔嗒跑过一座桥，他们离追赶的队伍越来越远，离家也越来越近，但前面还有一段路。这时第九次钟声响起，马车开始显现出南瓜的模样，原本优雅匀称的外形变得滚圆，顶上还冒出了瓜蒂。第十声钟响时，马儿都消失了，只留下四只老鼠，看着前进的南瓜车害怕得吱吱直叫。鹅跌到路面上，高声叫唤了几下后，抖抖身子，开始朝家飞去。终于，第十一声和第十二声钟响起的时候，咒语彻底解除了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">With the sounds of the last bell fading away, Ella found herself sitting on the ground, the pumpkin cracked beside her. There was a slight whoosh as her jewels transformed back into fireflies, and then, last but not least, her beautiful gown became the torn and ragged dress from before. All that was left of the magic was a single glass slipper. Ella pushed herself to her feet and began to brush herself off.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随着最后一声钟响慢慢消失，瑞拉跌坐在地上，南瓜在她身边崩裂开来。伴着轻快的“嗖”的一声，她穿戴的珠宝变回了萤火虫，漂亮的礼服也终于变成了原来的褴褛衣裳，这场魔法留给她的只剩一只水晶鞋。瑞拉挣扎着站起来，掸了掸身上的灰尘。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The horses' ears became round, and their muzzles narrowed into snouts. Then the coachman transformed completely back into a goose, his uniform falling around his webbed feet. The carriage itself began to shake and the footmen became lizards once more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="马儿的耳朵开始变圆，口鼻也收窄变长了。接着，车夫已经完全变回了鹅的样子，身上的制服耷拉下来，垂到他有蹼的脚上。马车开始抖动起来，侍从们也变成了蜥蜴。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A light rain began to fall. Ella cupped her hand over the slipper so the mice would not get wet and made her way back to the house. She heard the sound of a carriage approaching. Ducking to the side of the drive, she rushed through the pantry and into the kitchen just as she heard her stepsisters clatter through the front door. There was murmuring as the girls bickered, and then, much to Ella's dismay, she heard their footsteps moving closer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="天上下起了小雨。回家的路上，瑞拉把手挡在水晶鞋上，免得雨把老鼠们淋湿。这时她听见有辆马车的声音，越来越近。她连忙躲到车道边，快速跑过储藏室，进了厨房，正好听见她的两位姐姐嬉笑着从前门进屋了。两个姑娘低声拌着嘴，瑞拉听见她们的脚步声越来越近，不由得惊慌失措。">查看中文翻译</div>

Inside was the beautiful toy butterfly her father had given to her many years earlier. She gently placed the slipper next to it and then put the board back in place.

Her mind kept replaying moments from the ball: seeing Kit for the first time; feeling his hand in hers; swinging in the wild garden. The memories flashed through her mind, each one vivid and perfect. Yet her stepmother had said the prince could not marry for love. If that was true, she and Kit could never have a future. Not that she was sure he would want a future with her, or her with him. She shook her head to clear her thoughts.</div>
