<div class="line_en">Laila was lying still on the living-room couch, sweating through her blouse. Every exhaled breath burned the tip of her nose. She was aware of her parents talking in Mammy's room. Two nights ago, and again last night, she had awakened and thought she heard their voices downstairs. They were talking every day now, ever since the bullet, ever since the new hole in the gate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱拉静静地躺在客厅的沙发上，汗水浸透了她的上衣。每一次呼气都使鼻尖灼痛。她知道她的父母在妈妈的房间里谈话。前天晚上，还有昨天晚上，她都是半夜醒来，隐隐约约地听到他们在楼下交谈的声音。自从大门被子弹打穿一个新的洞孔之后，他们每天都在交谈。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was, by far, the hottest day of the year. The mountains trapped the bone-scorching heat, stifled the city like smoke. Power had been out for days. All over Kabul, electric fans sat idle, almost mockingly so.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那一天是夏天开始以来最热的日子。群山围住炎热至极的空气，整座城市热得像要冒烟。电力已经停了好几天。喀布尔各个地方的电风扇都停止运转，仿佛在嘲弄着世人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Inside Laila too a battle was being waged: guilt on one side, partnered with shame, and, on the other, the conviction that what she and Tariq had done was not sinful; that it had been natural, good, beautiful, even inevitable, spurred by the knowledge that they might never see each other again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="屋里的莱拉也正在进行着一场战争：一边是伴随着羞愧的罪恶感，另一边则是认为塔里克和她这么做并没有罪的坚定信念；那只是一件自然的、有益的、美妙的、甚至不可避免的事情罢了，他们这么做，全都因为知道今生再也无缘相会。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Laila rolled to her side on the couch now and tried to remember something: At one point, when they were on the floor, Tariq had lowered his forehead on hers. Then he had panted something, either Am I hurting you? or Is this hurting you?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱拉在沙发上翻了个身，试图想起某件事：他们躺在地板上的时候，在某个时刻，塔里克的额头抵在她的额头上。然后他喘息着说了一句话，可能是我把你弄痛了吗？也可能是这样你觉得痛吗？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">With the passing of time, she would slowly tire of this exercise. She would find it increasingly exhausting to conjure up, to dust off, to resuscitate once again what was long dead. There would come a day, in fact, years later, when Laila would no longer bewail his loss. Or not as relentlessly; not nearly. There would come a day when the details of his face would begin to slip from memory's grip, when overhearing a mother on the street call after her child by Tariq's name would no longer cut her adrift. She would not miss him as she did now, when the ache of his absence was her unremitting companion -- like the phantom pain of an amputee.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随着时间的流逝，她将会慢慢厌倦这种行为。她将会明白，召唤死去已久的回忆、掸走它上面的灰尘、使它重新浮现是一件越来越耗费精力的事情。实际上，多年以后，将会有一天莱拉再也不会因为失去他而哀泣，或者说她将再也不会这样无休无止地悲伤。肯定不会。终有一天，她的脑海再也不能清楚地浮现他的脸庞；终有一天，她再也不会因为听到一个母亲在街道上用塔里克的名字呼唤儿子而怅然若失。她将不会像现在这样思念他；但此时此刻，他的远走高飞带来的痛苦如同附骨之蛆，一刻也不间断地啮食她的灵魂。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Except every once in a long while, when Laila was a grown woman, ironing a shirt or pushing her children on a swing set, something trivial, maybe the warmth of a carpet beneath her feet on a hot day or the curve of a stranger's forehead, would set off a memory of that afternoon together. And it would all come rushing back. The spontaneity of it. Their astonishing imprudence. Their clumsiness. The pain of the act, the pleasure of it, the sadness of it. The heat of their entangled bodies.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但也有例外的时候。等到莱拉变成一个成年妇女，当她熨烫衬衣或者推着孩子荡秋千的时候，一些微不足道的事情，比如某个炎热的日子里脚下的地毯传来的温热感觉，又比如某个陌生人的额头的曲线，会让她想起一个两人共同度过的下午。这段回忆会一下子涌现出来。完全不受莱拉的控制。他们的胆大妄为。他们的笨手笨脚。那个动作带来的痛苦，它带来的欢乐，还有它带来的悲伤。他们纠缠的身体产生的灼热。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Laila knew that somewhere in the city someone had just died, and that a pall of black smoke was hovering over some building that had collapsed in a puffing mass of dust.

<div class="line_en">All the same, Laila had an urge to run through those streets. She could barely contain her own happiness. It took effort to sit, to not shriek with joy. Babi said they would go to Pakistan first, to apply for visas. Pakistan, where Tariq was! Tariq was only gone seventeen days, Laila calculated excitedly. If only Mammy had made up her mind seventeen days earlier, they could have left together. She would have been with Tariq right now! But that didn't matter now. They were going to Peshawar -- she, Mammy, and Babi -- and they would find Tariq and his parents there. Surely they would. They would process their paperwork together. Then, who knew? Who knew? Europe? America? Maybe, as Babi was always saying, somewhere near the sea…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="与此同时，莱拉很想冲上这些街道。她简直无法抑制住心中的快乐。她费了很大劲才能坐下来，让自己不因为快乐而颤抖。爸爸说他们将会先到巴基斯坦去，在那儿申请签证。巴基斯坦，塔里克就在那儿！塔里克才走了十七天，莱拉兴奋地计算着。要是妈妈在十七天前作出这个决定就好了，那他们就可以一起走。那她现在应该和塔里克在一起！但现在这一切都变得没关系了。他们将会到白沙瓦去——她，妈妈和爸爸——他们能够在那边找到塔里克和他的父母。他们肯定能找到的。他们会一起申请签证。然后，谁知道呢？谁知道呢？欧洲？美国？也许像爸爸经常说的那样，去某个靠近大海的地方……">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Three days before, Laila had gone outside for a breath of air. She'd stood by the front gates, leaning against them, when she'd heard a loud crack and something had zipped by her right ear, sending tiny splinters of wood flying before her eyes. After Giti's death, and the thousands of rounds fired and myriad rockets that had fallen on Kabul, it was the sight of that single round hole in the gate, less than three fingers away from where Laila's head had been, that shook Mammy awake. Made her see that one war had cost her two children already; this latest could cost her her remaining one.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="三天之前，莱拉曾经到外面去透气。她站在前门，倚着门板，当时她听到一阵爆裂声，有东西擦着她的右耳穿过，使得一些细小的木屑在她眼前飞舞。在吉提死后，在几千轮炮火之后，在无数火箭弹降落在喀布尔城里之后，她家的大门终于被打穿了一个洞孔。洞孔离莱拉的脑袋只有三个手指那么宽的距离，它让妈妈醒了过来。让她明白已经有一场战争夺走了她两个儿子，而最新的这一场将会夺走她仅剩的一个女儿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">From the walls of the room, Ahmad and Noor smiled down. Laila watched Mammy's eyes bouncing now, guiltily, from one photo to the other. As if looking for their consent. Their blessing. As if asking for forgiveness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="艾哈迈德和努尔在房间的墙壁向下微笑。莱拉发现妈妈的眼睛在瞟来瞟去，带着愧疚，从一张照片看到另一张照片。仿佛在征求他们的同意。他们的祝福。仿佛在请求他们原谅。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="那天晚上接下来几个小时，莱拉兴奋得睡不着。她躺在床上，看着橙色的、黄色的炮火在远处绚丽地升起。不过，尽管心内兴奋，屋外炮声连连，她还是在某个时刻睡着了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They are on a ribbon of beach, sitting on a quilt. It's a chilly, overcast day, but it's warm next to Tariq under the blanket draped over their shoulders. She can see cars parked behind a low fence of chipped white paint beneath a row of windswept palm trees. The wind makes her eyes water and buries their shoes in sand, hurls knots of dead grass from the curved ridges of one dune to another.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="梦中是一抹蓝色的海滩，他们坐在一张棉被上。天很冷，阴沉沉的，但她和塔里克坐在一起，肩膀盖着毛毯，她觉得很暖和。她看到一排被风吹得弯下腰的棕榈树下有一道低矮的篱笆，篱笆是白色的，油漆有些剥落，后面停着几辆轿车。海风吹得她眼泪直流，将他们的鞋子埋在沙中，还将一些枯死的草从一座弧形的沙丘刮向另一座弧形的沙丘。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They're watching sailboats bob in the distance. Around them, seagulls squawk and shiver in the wind. The wind whips up another spray of sand off the shallow, windward slopes.

A miniature-soccer-ball key chain, a gift from Giti. A little wooden zebra on wheels. A ceramic astronaut she and Tariq had found one day in a gutter. She'd been six and he eight.

<div class="line_en">Laila looked up. It was Mammy calling down from her bedroom upstairs. She was leaning out the window, resting her elbows on the sill. The sun, bright and warm, caught in her graying hair, shone on her drawn, thin face. Mammy was wearing the same cobalt blue dress she had worn the day of the lunch party four months earlier, a youthful dress meant for a young woman, but, for a moment, Mammy looked to Laila like an old woman. An old woman with stringy arms and sunken temples and slow eyes rimmed by darkened circles of weariness, an altogether different creature from the plump, round-faced woman beaming radiantly from those grainy wedding photos.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱拉抬起头。原来是妈妈在楼上的卧室朝她大喊。她的身体伸出窗外，手肘支撑在窗台上。明亮而温热的太阳照耀着她日渐灰白的头发，她那张瘦长的脸洒满了阳光。妈妈身上穿着四个月前她举办午宴那天穿的深蓝色裙子。一条年轻的裙子会让女人显得很年轻，但是那一刻，在莱拉眼中，妈妈很像一个老太婆。一个双臂纤细、太阳穴深陷、双眼无神、累得眼圈发黑的老太婆，和那些发黄的结婚照片中那个容光焕发、体态丰腴的圆脸女人完全是两个人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Laila pictured the beach again. Except now the singing was all around. And growing. Louder and louder by the moment, higher and higher. It flooded her ears. Drowned everything else out. The gulls were feathered mimes now, opening and closing their beaks noiselessly, and the waves were crashing with foam and spray but no roar. The sands sang on. Screaming now. A sound like… a tinkling?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱拉又想起了那个海滩。只不过现在歌声从四面八方传来。而且越来越响。每一秒都变得越来越响亮，越来越大声。它涌进了她的耳朵。把其他一切声音都淹没了。那些海鸥变成了长羽毛的哑剧演员，它们的嘴巴不停地张开闭上，却没有啼叫；海浪扑打上来，水花和泡沫四溅，却没有涛声。沙子唱起了歌。这时歌声变得很凄厉。听上去像是……清脆的叮当声？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="她停下了手中的活。她看见一只灰色的蜥蜴从地上的一道裂缝爬出来。它的头左右摇晃。它眨了眨眼，冲到一块石头之下。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And now she was flying, twisting and rotating in the air, seeing sky, then earth, then sky, then earth. A big burning chunk of wood whipped by. So did a thousand shards of glass, and it seemed to Laila that she could see each individual one flying all around her, flipping slowly end over end, the sunlight catching in each. Tiny, beautiful rainbows.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时她飞了起来，身体在空中不停地扭曲着，旋转着；她看见天空，然后是陆地，然后是天空，然后是陆地。一大根燃烧的木头从她身边飞过。同样从她身旁飞过的还有一千块玻璃的碎片，莱拉觉得自己似乎能看清每一块在她周围飞舞的碎片，慢慢地、一块接一块地不停翻动，每一块碎片上面都有阳光在闪耀。像是细小而美丽的彩虹。">查看中文翻译</div>
