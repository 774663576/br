<div class="line_en">But setting up house with Tereza cramped his style. Because of the organizational difficulties it entailed, he had been forced to relegate his erotic activities to a narrow strip of time (between the operating room and home) which, though he had used it intensively (as a mountain farmer tills his narrow plot for all it is worth), was nothing like the sixteen hours that now had suddenly been bestowed on him. (I say sixteen hours because the eight hours he spent washing windows were filled with new salesgirls, housewives, and female functionaries, each of whom represented a potential erotic engagement.)</div>

<div class="line_en">When his friends asked him how many women he had had in his life, he would try to evade the question, and when they pressed him further he would say, Well, two hundred, give or take a few. The envious among them accused him of stretching the truth. That's not so many, he said by way of self-defense. I've been involved with women for about twenty-five years now. Divide two hundred by twenty-five and you'll see it comes to only eight or so new women a year. That's not so many, is it?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="朋友问他有过多少女人时，他闪烁其词，如果他们追问，他就说：“该有两百个左右吧。”几个心怀嫉妒的家伙断定他在吹嘘，他辩解道：“这不算多。我和女人大概打了二十五年的交道。用两百除以二十五，你们瞧瞧，每年差不多才八个新的女人。这不算多。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Not at all. There is always the small part that is unimaginable. When he saw a woman in her clothes, he could naturally imagine more or less what she would look like naked (his experience as a doctor supplementing his experience as a lover), but between the approximation of the idea and the precision of reality there was a small gap of the unimaginable, and it was this hiatus that gave him no rest. And then, the pursuit of the unimaginable does not stop with the revelations of nudity; it goes much further: How would she behave while undressing? What would she say when he made love to her? How would her sighs sound? How would her face distort at the moment of orgasm?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="绝非如此。总有百分之几是难以想象的。看到一个穿戴整齐的女人，他显然能多多少少想象出她裸体的模样（在这里，医生的经历和情人的经验相得益彰），但是在大致的意念和精确的现实之间，还存在一个无法想象的小小空白，正是这一空白令他不得安宁。然而，对于难以想象部分的追寻不会因为肉体的袒露而结束，它将走得更远：她脱衣服的时候是什么表情？跟他做爱时，她会说些什么？她的叹息是什么声调？高潮来临那一刻，她的脸会怎样扭曲？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What did he look for in them? What attracted him to them? Isn't making love merely an eternal repetition of the same?</div>

<div class="line_en">What is unique about the I hides itself exactly in what is unimaginable about a person. All we are able to imagine is what makes everyone like everyone else, what people have in common. The individual I is what differs from the common stock, that is, what cannot be guessed at or calculated, what must be unveiled, uncovered, conquered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我”的独特性恰恰隐藏在人类无法想象的那一部分。我们能够想象的，仅仅是众人身上一致、相同之处。个别的“我”，区别于普遍，因此预先猜不出，估不了，需要在他者身上揭示它，发掘它，征服它。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">(Here too, perhaps, his passion for surgery and his passion for women came together. Even with his mistresses, he could never quite put down the imaginary scalpel. Since he longed to take possession of something deep inside them, he needed to slit them open.)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="（或许，在这里，他对外科的激情和对女色的激情是一致的。即便和情妇在一起时，他也没有松开想象这一解剖刀。他渴望征服深藏在她们体内的某一东西，为此要撕开她们外面的包裹物。）">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tomas was obsessed by the desire to discover and appropriate that one-millionth part; he saw it as the core of his obsession. He was not obsessed with women; he was obsessed with what in each of them is unimaginable, obsessed, in other words, with the one-millionth part that makes a woman dissimilar to others of her sex.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="发现那百万分之一，并征服它，托马斯执迷于这一欲念。在他看来，迷恋女性的意义即在于此。他迷恋的不是女人，而是每个女人身上无法想象的部分，换句话说，就是使一个女人有别于他者的百万分之一的不同之处。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tomas, who had spent the last ten years of his medical practice working exclusively with the human brain, knew that there was nothing more difficult to capture than the human I. There are many more resemblances between Hitler and Einstein or Brezhnev and Solzhenitsyn than there are differences. Using numbers, we might say that there is one-millionth part dissimilarity to nine hundred ninety-nine thousand nine hundred ninety-nine millionths parts similarity.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在最近十年的行医活动中，托马斯专门和人类的大脑打交道，他知道没有比抓住这“我”更难的事了。希特勒和爱因斯坦，勃列日涅夫和索尔仁尼琴，他们之间的相似远远多于不同。如果能用数据来表示，他们之间有百万分之一的不同，百万分之九十九万九千九百九十九的相同。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We may ask, of course, why he sought that millionth part dissimilarity in sex and nowhere else. Why couldn't he find it, say, in a woman's gait or culinary caprices or artistic taste?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="人们当然有权利追问为什么他只在性方面寻找那百万分之一的不同之处。他难道不能，比如说，从她们的步态、烹调口味或对美的偏好等方面去寻求？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">To be sure, the millionth part dissimilarity is present in all areas of human existence, but in all areas other than sex it is exposed and needs no one to discover it, needs no scalpel. One woman prefers cheese at the end of the meal, another loathes cauliflower, and although each may demonstrate her originality thereby, it is an originality that demonstrates its own irrelevance and warns us to pay it no heed, to expect nothing of value to come of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，这百万分之一的不同体现在人类生活的各个方面，尤其是公诸于世的，用不着去探究，也用不上解剖刀。一个女人喜欢奶酪胜于蛋糕，另外一个忍受不了花椰菜，这的确是表现其独特性的信号，然而，我们很快就看到，这种独特性完全没有意义，对其感兴趣并在其中找寻某种价值简直是在浪费时间。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So it was a desire not for pleasure (the pleasure came as an extra, a bonus) but for possession of the world (slitting open the outstretched body of the world with his scalpel) that sent him in pursuit of women.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以，促使托马斯追逐女性的不是感官享乐（感观享受像是额外所得的一笔奖赏），而是征服世界的这一欲念（用解剖刀划开世界这横陈的躯体）。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Only in sexuality does the millionth part dissimilarity become precious, because, not accessible in public, it must be conquered. As recently as fifty years ago, this form of conquest took considerable time (weeks, even months!), and the worth of the conquered object was proportional to the time the conquest took. Even today, when conquest time has been drastically cut, sexuality seems still to be a strongbox hiding the mystery of a woman's I.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="只有在性上，那百万分之一的不同才显珍贵，因为不是公开就能了解的，而需要去征服。还在半个世纪以前，这种征服需要更多的时间（几个星期，有时甚至是几个月！）。被征服对象的价值与征服她们的时间成正比。甚至在今天，尽管征服的时间大大缩短，性仍旧像一个保险箱，女性之“我”的所有奥秘都藏在里头。">查看中文翻译</div>
