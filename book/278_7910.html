<div class="line_en">Gerda was obliged to rest herself again, when, exactly opposite to her, a large Raven came hopping over the white snow. He had long been looking at Gerda and shaking his head; and now he said, "Caw! Caw!" Good day! Good day! He could not say it better; but he felt a sympathy for the little girl, and asked her where she was going all alone. The word "alone" Gerda understood quite well, and felt how much was expressed by it; so she told the Raven her whole history, and asked if he had not seen Kay.</div>

<div class="line_en">"In the kingdom where we now are there lives a Princess, who is extraordinarily clever; for she has read all the newspapers in the whole world, and has forgotten them again-so clever is she. She was lately, it is said, sitting on her throne-which is not very amusing after all-when she began humming an old tune, and it was just, 'Oh, why should I not be married?' 'That song is not without its meaning,' said she, and so then she was determined to marry; but she would have a husband who knew how to give an answer when he was spoken to-not one who looked only as if he were a great personage, for that is so tiresome. She then had all the ladies of the court drummed together; and when they heard her intention, all were very pleased, and said, 'We are very glad to hear it; it is the very thing we were thinking of.' You may believe every word I say," said the Raven; "for I have a tame sweetheart that hops about in the palace quite free, and it was she who told me all this.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“在我们现在所在的这个王国里，有一位非常聪明的公主。她读过世界上所有的报纸，然后又把它们忘得精光，因为她是那么聪明。最近她坐上了王位——据说这并不怎么有趣——这时她哼出一支歌，而这歌只有这么一句：‘为什么我现在不结婚呢？’她说：‘是的，这句话里有道理。’因此她很想结婚。不过她所希望的丈夫是：当人们和他讲话时，他必须能答话，不仅是站在那儿，只是好看而已——因为这是怪讨厌的。于是她把侍女都召进来：当她们知道了她的用意的时候，她们都非常高兴。‘好极了！’她们说：‘前不久我们也有这个意见。’请你相信，我对你讲的每一个字都是真的！”乌鸦说。“我有一位很驯服的爱人，她可以在宫里自由来往，因此她把所有的事情都告诉我了。” 当然所谓“爱人”也无非是一个乌鸦，因为乌鸦只会找类似的东西——那永远是一个乌鸦。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes, Yes," said the Raven, "you may believe it; it is as true as I am sitting here. People came in crowds; there was a crush and a hurry, but no one was successful either on the first or second day. They could all talk well enough when they were out in the street; but as soon as they came inside the palace gates, and saw the guard richly dressed in silver, and the lackeys in gold on the staircase, and the large illuminated saloons, then they were abashed; and when they stood before the throne on which the Princess was sitting, all they could do was to repeat the last word they had uttered, and to hear it again did not interest her very much. It was just as if the people within were under a charm, and had fallen into a trance till they came out again into the street; for then-oh, then-they could chatter enough. There was a whole row of them standing from the town-gates to the palace. I was there myself to look," said the Raven. "They grew hungry and thirsty; but from the palace they got nothing whatever, not even a glass of water. Some of the cleverest, it is true, had taken bread and butter with them: but none shared it with his neighbor, for each thought, 'Let him look hungry, and then the Princess won't have him.'"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，是的！”乌鸦说，“请你相信我。我的话实实在在，没有半句虚假。年轻人成群结队地到来。当他们来到街上的时候，什么话都会讲；不过他们一起进宫殿的门、看到穿银色制服的门警、看到台阶上站着穿金色制服的仆人和光耀夺目的大厅的时候，他们什么话也说不出来，只能重复地念着公主所说出的话的最后一个字——而她并不要再听自己的话。好像这些人的肚皮里都塞满了鼻烟、已经昏睡过去了似的。只有当他们回到街上来了以后，才能讲话。这些人从城门那儿一直站到宫门口，排成了一长队。我自己曾经去亲眼看过一次！”乌鸦说。“他们变得又饥又渴，不过到了宫殿里，他们连一杯温水也得不到。最聪明的几个人随身带了一点抹了黄油的面包，不过他们并不分给旁边的人吃，因为他们觉得，‘还是让这家伙现出一个饿鬼的样子吧，公主不会要他的！’”">查看中文翻译</div>

The saloons were gleaming with lustres-privy councillors and excellencies were walking about barefooted, and wore gold keys; it was enough to make any one feel uncomfortable. His boots creaked, too, so loudly, but still he was not at all afraid."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“也可能是！”乌鸦说，“因为我没有仔细去瞧它！不过我听我那位驯服的爱人说起，当他走进宫殿的门、看到穿银色制服的守卫和台阶上穿金色制服的仆人的时候，他一点也不感到慌张。他点点头，对他们说：‘站在这些台阶上一定是一件很腻烦的工作——我倒是宁愿走进去的！’大厅的烛光照耀得如同白昼。枢密顾问官和大臣们托着金盘子，打着赤脚走来走去。这叫人起一种庄严的感觉！他的靴子发出吱格吱格的响声，但是他却一点也不害怕！”">查看中文翻译</div>

All the ladies of the court, with their attendants and attendants' attendants, and all the cavaliers, with their gentlemen and gentlemen's gentlemen, stood round; and the nearer they stood to the door, the prouder they looked. It was hardly possible to look at the gentleman's gentleman, so very haughtily did he stand in the doorway."</div>

<div class="line_en">The evening was closing in when the Raven returned. "Caw-caw!" said he. "She sends you her compliments; and here is a roll for you. She took it out of the kitchen, where there is bread enough. You are hungry, no doubt. It is not possible for you to enter the palace, for you are barefooted: the guards in silver, and the lackeys in gold, would not allow it; but do not cry, you shall come in still. My sweetheart knows a little back stair that leads to the bedchamber, and she knows where she can get the key of it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当乌鸦回来的时候，天已经黑了很久。“呱！呱！”它说，“我代表我的爱人向你问候。这是我带给你的一小片面包。这是她从厨房里拿出来的。那儿面包多的是。你现在一定很饿了！……你想到宫里去是不可能的，因为你是打着赤脚的。那些穿着银色制服的警卫和穿着金色制服的仆人们不会让你进去的。不过请你不要哭；你还是可以进去的。我的爱人知道通到睡房的一个小后楼梯，同时她也知道可以在什么地方弄到钥匙！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That is very easily said," answered the Raven. "But how are we to manage it? I'll speak to my tame sweetheart about it: she must advise us; for so much I must tell you, such a little girl as you are will never get permission to enter."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这事说来容易！”乌鸦说。“不过我们怎样实行呢？让我先跟我那个驯服的爱人商量一下吧。她可能给我们一点忠告。我要告诉你一点——像你这样小的女孩子，一般是不会得到许可走进里面去的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Here the dreams were rushing past, but they hastened by so quickly that Gerda could not see the high personages. One hall was more magnificent than the other; one might indeed well be abashed; and at last they came into the bedchamber. The ceiling of the room resembled a large palm-tree with leaves of glass, of costly glass; and in the middle, from a thick golden stem, hung two beds, each of which resembled a lily. One was white, and in this lay the Princess; the other was red, and it was here that Gerda was to look for little Kay. She bent back one of the red leaves, and saw a brown neck. Oh! that was Kay! She called him quite loud by name, held the lamp towards him-the dreams rushed back again into the chamber-he awoke, turned his head, and-it was not little Kay!</div>

It was of pure gold, and the arms of the Prince and Princess shone like a star upon it; the coachman, the footmen, and the outriders, for outriders were there, too, all wore golden crowns. The Prince and the Princess assisted her into the carriage themselves, and wished her all success. The Raven of the woods, who was now married, accompanied her for the first three miles. He sat beside Gerda, for he could not bear riding backwards; the other Raven stood in the doorway, and flapped her wings; she could not accompany Gerda, because she suffered from headache since she had had a fixed appointment and ate so much. The carriage was lined inside with sugar-plums, and in the seats were fruits and gingerbread.</div>

They had something to eat and drink; and then went into a corner, where straw and carpets were lying. Beside them, on laths and perches, sat nearly a hundred pigeons, all asleep, seemingly; but yet they moved a little when the robber maiden came. "They are all mine," said she, at the same time seizing one that was next to her by the legs and shaking it so that its wings fluttered. "Kiss it," cried the little girl, and flung the pigeon in Gerda's face. "Up there is the rabble of the wood," continued she, pointing to several laths which were fastened before a hole high up in the wall; "that's the rabble; they would all fly away immediately, if they were not well fastened in. And here is my dear old Bac"; and she laid hold of the horns of a reindeer, that had a bright copper ring round its neck, and was tethered to the spot. "We are obliged to lock this fellow in too, or he would make his escape. Every evening I tickle his neck with my sharp knife; he is so frightened at it!" and the little girl drew forth a long knife, from a crack in the wall, and let it glide over the Reindeer's neck. The poor animal kicked; the girl laughed, and pulled Gerda into bed with her.</div>

<div class="line_en">When Gerda had warmed herself, and had eaten and drunk, the Lapland woman wrote a few words on a dried haberdine, begged Gerda to take care of them, put her on the Reindeer, bound her fast, and away sprang the animal. "Ddsa! Ddsa!" was again heard in the air; the most charming blue lights burned the whole night in the sky, and at last they came to Finland. They knocked at the chimney of the Finland woman; for as to a door, she had none.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当格尔达暖了一阵、吃了和喝了一些东西以后，拉普兰女人就在一条干鳕鱼上写下几个字，并且告诉格尔达好好拿着它，然后把她系在驯鹿的背上，这鹿立刻就跳走了，“呼！呼！”它在高空中说。最美丽的、蔚蓝色的北极光，一整夜不停地在闪耀着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was such a heat inside that the Finland woman herself went about almost naked. She was diminutive and dirty. She immediately loosened little Gerda's clothes, pulled off her thick gloves and boots; for otherwise the heat would have been too great-and after laying a piece of ice on the Reindeer's head, read what was written on the fish-skin. She read it three times: she then knew it by heart; so she put the fish into the cupboard-for it might very well be eaten, and she never threw anything away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这样他们到了芬马克，他们在那个芬兰女人的烟囱上敲着，因为她连一个门也没有。屋子里的热气很大，芬兰女人几乎是一丝不挂地住在那儿。她的身材很小，而且很脏。她马上把格尔达的衣服解开，把她的大手套和靴子脱下，否则格尔达就会感到太热了。她在驯鹿的头上放了一块冰，然后读了写在鳕鱼上的字——她一连读了三遍。当她把这些字都记熟了以后，就把这鱼扔进一个汤罐里去煮，因为它是可以吃的，而且她又是一个从来不浪费任何东西的人。">查看中文翻译</div>

Don't you see how men and animals are forced to serve her; how well she gets through the world barefooted? She must not hear of her power from us; that power lies in her heart, because she is a sweet and innocent child! If she cannot get to the Snow Queen by herself, and rid little Kay of the glass, we cannot help her. Two miles hence the garden of the Snow Queen begins; thither you may carry the little girl.

<div class="line_en">Little Gerda repeated the Lord's Prayer. The cold was so intense that she could see her own breath, which came like smoke out of her mouth. It grew thicker and thicker, and took the form of little angels, that grew more and more when they touched the earth. All had helms on their heads, and lances and shields in their hands; they increased in numbers; and when Gerda had finished the Lord's Prayer, she was surrounded by a whole legion. They thrust at the horrid snow-flakes with their spears, so that they flew into a thousand pieces; and little Gerda walked on bravely and in security. The angels patted her hands and feet; and then she felt the cold less, and went on quickly towards the palace of the Snow Queen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小小的格尔达念着《主祷文》。天气是那么寒冷，她可以看到自己呼出的气像烟雾似的从嘴里冒出来。呼出的气越来越浓，形成了明亮的小安琪儿。当他们一接触到地面时，就越变越大。他们都戴着头盔，拿着矛和盾。他们的数目在增大。当格尔达念完了祷告以后，她周围就出现了一个很大的兵团。这些兵士用长矛刺着这些可怕的雪花，把这些雪花打成无数碎片。于是小小的格尔达就又稳步地、勇敢地向前进。安琪儿抚摸着她的手和脚，于是她就不那么感到寒冷了。她匆忙地向白雪皇后的宫殿前进。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She ran on as fast as she could. There then came a whole regiment of snow-flakes, but they did not fall from above, and they were quite bright and shining from the Aurora Borealis. The flakes ran along the ground, and the nearer they came the larger they grew. Gerda well remembered how large and strange the snow-flakes appeared when she once saw them through a magnifying-glass; but now they were large and terrific in another manner-they were all alive. They were the outposts of the Snow Queen. They had the most wondrous shapes; some looked like large ugly porcupines; others like snakes knotted together, with their heads sticking out; and others, again, like small fat bears, with the hair standing on end: all were of dazzling whiteness-all were living snow-flakes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她拼命地向前跑。一股雪花卷过来了。它不是从天上落下来的，因为天上非常晴朗，而且还射出北极光。雪花是沿着地面卷来的。它越逼得近，就越变得庞大。格尔达记起，从前她透过热玻璃朝外望的时候，雪花是多么大，多么美丽啊。不过在这儿它们显得非常庞大和可怕——它们是有生命的。它们是白雪皇后的前哨兵，而且是奇形怪状的。有的样子像丑陋的大刺猬；有的像许多伸出头、纠成一团的蛇；有的像毛发直立的小胖熊。它们全都是白得发亮的、有生命的雪花。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The walls of the palace were of driving snow, and the windows and doors of cutting winds. There were more than a hundred halls there, according as the snow was driven by the winds. The largest was many miles in extent; all were lighted up by the powerful Aurora Borealis, and all were so large, so empty, so icy cold, and so resplendent! Mirth never reigned there; there was never even a little bear-ball, with the storm for music, while the polar bears went on their hind legs and showed off their steps. Never a little tea-party of white young lady foxes; vast, cold, and empty were the halls of the Snow Queen. The northern-lights shone with such precision that one could tell exactly when they were at their highest or lowest degree of brightness. In the middle of the empty, endless hall of snow, was a frozen lake; it was cracked in a thousand pieces, but each piece was so like the other, that it seemed the work of a cunning artificer. In the middle of this lake sat the Snow Queen when she was at home; and then she said she was sitting in the Mirror of Understanding, and that this was the only one and the best thing in the world.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I am going now to warm lands," said the Snow Queen. "I must have a look down into the black caldrons." It was the volcanoes Vesuvius and Etna that she meant. "I will just give them a coating of white, for that is as it ought to be; besides, it is good for the oranges and the grapes." And then away she flew, and Kay sat quite alone in the empty halls of ice that were miles long, and looked at the blocks of ice, and thought and thought till his skull was almost cracked. There he sat quite benumbed and motionless; one would have imagined he was frozen to death.</div>

<div class="line_en">Little Kay was quite blue, yes nearly black with cold; but he did not observe it, for she had kissed away all feeling of cold from his body, and his heart was a lump of ice. He was dragging along some pointed flat pieces of ice, which he laid together in all possible ways, for he wanted to make something with them; just as we have little flat pieces of wood to make geometrical figures with, called the Chinese Puzzle. Kay made all sorts of figures, the most complicated, for it was an ice-puzzle for the understanding. In his eyes the figures were extraordinarily beautiful, and of the utmost importance; for the bit of glass which was in his eye caused this. He found whole figures which represented a written word; but he never could manage to represent just the word he wanted-that word was "eternity"; and the Snow Queen had said, "If you can discover that figure, you shall be your own master, and I will make you a present of the whole world and a pair of new skates." But he could not find it out.</div>
