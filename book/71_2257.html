<div class="line_en">When Franz recovered his senses, he found Albert drinking a glass of water, which his pale colour showed he needed urgently, and the count already putting on his clown's costume. He automatically looked into the square. Everything had vanished: scaffold, executioners, victims. Only the people remained, noisy, busy, jovial. The bell on the Monte Citorio, which was rung only for the death of the pope and the beginning of the mascherata, was pouring forth its sound.</div>

<div class="line_en">Franz and Albert were like men who had been conducted to an orgy to help them forget some awful grief and who, the more they drank and the more they became intoxicated, felt a curtain descend between the past and the present. They could still see -- or, rather, they continued to feel inside them -- the shadow of what they had witnessed. But little by little they were possessed by the intoxication of the crowd; their minds began to feel unsteady and the power of reason seemed to be slipping away; they experienced a strange need to take part in this noise, this movement, this dizziness. A handful of confetti which struck Morcerf, thrown from a nearby carriage, covered him in dust, as it did his two companions, while stinging his neck and wherever on his face was not covered by the mask, as if a gross of pins had been thrown at him; but it had the effect of driving him into the fray in which all the masks they encountered were already engaged. He rose in turn in the carriage, filled his hands from the sacks and hurled eggs and dragées at his neighbours with all the strength and skill he could muster.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弗兰士和阿尔培象借酒消愁的人一样，在喝醉了以后，就觉得已有一重厚厚的纱幕隔开了过去和现在。可是他们却老是看到，或说得更正确些，他们依旧在心里想着刚才他们所目击的那一幕。但渐渐地，那到处弥漫着的兴奋情绪也传染到他们身上，他们觉得自己也不得不参加到那种嘈杂和混乱之中。附近的一辆马车里抛来了一把五色碎纸，把车上的三位同伴撒得满身都是，马瑟夫的脖子上和面具未遮住的那一部分脸上象是受了一百只小针刺戳似地弄得怪痒的，于是他被卷进了周围正在进行的一场混战里。他站起身来，抓起几把装在马车里的五色碎纸，使劲儿向他左近的人投去，表示他也是老于此道的能手。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It is hard to imagine a more complete contrast with what had just taken place. Instead of the gloomy and silent spectacle of death, the Piazza del Popolo was the scene of unbridled and garish merrymaking. A crowd of masked figures cascaded forth, bursting out on all sides, pouring through the doors and clambering through the windows. Carriages were emerging from every side-street, laden with pierrots, harlequins and dominos, marquesses and plebeians, grotesques, knights and peasants -- all yelling, waving their hands, throwing flour-filled eggs, confetti or bunches of flowers, assaulting friend and foe, stranger and acquaintance with words and missiles, without anyone having the right to object, with not a single reaction permitted except laughter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个突变真是难于想象。在波波罗广场上，代替死的阴郁和沉寂的，是一片兴高采烈和嘈杂的狂欢景象。四面八方，一群群戴面具的人流动过来，有从门里跑出来的，有离开窗口奔下来的。从每一条街，每一个角落，都有马车拥过来。马车上坐满了白衣白裤白面具的小丑，身穿花衣手持木刀的滑稽角色，戴半边面具的男男女女，侯爵夫人，勒司斐人，骑士和农民。大家尖声喊叫，打打闹闹，装腔作势，满天飞舞着装满了面粉的蛋壳，五色碎纸，花球，用他们的冷言冷语和种种可投掷的物品到处攻击人，也不分是敌是友，是同伴是陌生人，谁都不动气，大家都只是笑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">If you were to imagine that lovely and magnificent thoroughfare, the Corso, lined from one end to the other on either side with four- or five-storey mansions, each with its balconies spread with hangings and every window decked with draperies; and at the balconies and the windows, three hundred thousand spectators, Romans, Italians or foreigners from the four corners of the earth -- every form of aristocracy brought together: aristocracy of birth, aristocracy of money, aristocracy of talent; charming women who, themselves carried away by the spectacle, are bending over the balconies and leaning out of the windows to shower the carriages passing beneath with a hail of confetti, which is repaid in bunches of flowers -- the air thick with falling confetti and rising flowers; and then on the road itself a joyful, unceasing, demented crowd, with crazy costumes: huge cabbages walking along, buffalo-heads roaring on men's bodies, dogs apparently walking on their hind legs; and in the midst of all this, in the midst of this temptation of Saint Anthony as it might have been dreamed by Callot, a mask raised for some Astarte to reveal her delicious features, which you want to follow but from which you are kept back by demons such as might haunt a nightmare… then you would have a rough idea of what the carnival is like in Rome.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="试想那一条宽阔华丽的高碌街，从头到尾都耸立着巍巍的大厦，阳台上悬挂着花毯，窗口上飘扬着旗帜，在这些阳台上和窗口里，有三十万看客——罗马人，意大利人，还有从世界各地来的外国人，都是出身高贵，又有钱，又聪明的三位一体的贵族，可爱的娘儿们也被这种场面感动得忘了形，或倚着阳台，或靠着窗口，向经过的马车抛撒五色碎纸，马车里的人则以花球作回报。整个天空似乎都被落下来的五色碎纸和抛上去的花朵所遮黑了。街上挤满了生气勃勃的人群，都穿着奇形怪状的服装——硕大无比的大头鬼大摇大摆地走着，牛的头从人的肩胛后面伸过来嘶吼，狗被挤得直立起来用两条后腿走路。在这种种纷乱嘈杂之中，一只假面具向上揭了一下，而象卡洛的《圣安东尼之诱惑》①里所作的那样，露出了一个可爱的面孔，你本来很想钉梢上去的，但忽然一队魔鬼把你和她冲散了，上述的一切可以使你对于罗马的狂欢节有一个约略的概念。【注：①卡洛（1592－1635），十七世纪法国画家，《圣安东尼之诱惑》是他所作的一幅铜版画。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Franz thanked the count for his kind offer. As for Albert, he was engaged in flirting with a whole carriage full of Roman peasants which, like the count's, had stopped to take a rest, as vehicles are accustomed to do in traffic; he was showering it with bouquets.</div>

<div class="line_en">Albert was right. The beautiful stranger had no doubt decided not to carry the intrigue any further that day because, although the two young men made several more circuits, they did not find the carriage they were looking for: it had no doubt disappeared down one of the neighbouring side-streets.

The first place she looked was towards the place where, the previous evening, she had seen the count, so that she saw Franz and Albert in the box of the man about whom she had expressed such a strange opinion to Franz a day earlier. Her opera-glasses interrogated him with such emphasis that Franz realized it would be cruel to leave her curiosity unsatisfied any longer. So, taking advantage of the privilege of spectators in Italian theatres, which allows them to use the playhouses as their reception rooms, the two friends left their box to present their regards to the countess.

The Turks -- so picturesque in the old days with their long, brightly coloured robes -- are now hideous in their blue buttoned frock-coats and those Greek hats which make them look like wine bottles with red tops.

He was well enough acquainted with his friend's exceptional lack of discretion to realize that he would be kept informed of the smallest details of his success. And since, in two or three years of travelling the length and breadth of Italy, he had never had the good fortune even to begin such an intrigue on his own account, Franz was not displeased to discover how matters proceeded in such cases.

<div class="line_en">From two until five Franz and Albert followed the line of carriages, exchanging handfuls of confetti with those in the line opposite and with the pedestrians walking between the feet of the horses and the wheels of the carriages, without a single accident occurring, a single argument erupting or a single fight breaking out in all this appalling chaos. The Italians are supreme in this respect: a festivity for them is a genuine festivity. The author of this story, who lived for five or six years in Italy, can never once remember having seen a celebration interrupted by any of those disturbances that inevitably accompany our own.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从两点钟到五点钟，弗兰士和阿尔培跟在行列里，与别的马车和徒步的游客交换一把把的五色碎纸。那些徒步的人在马脚和车轮间挤来挤去，而竟没有发生一件意外，一件纠纷，或一次殴斗。过节是意大利人真正快乐的日子。本书的作者曾在意大利住过五六年，可想不起有哪一次典礼发生过意外事件，而那种事情在我国的一些庆祝活动中却常常连带发生。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As the day wore on, so the noise grew greater. On all those pavements, in all those carriages, at all those windows, not a single mouth remained silent, not a single arm remained still. It was a veritable human storm made up of a thunder of voices and a hail of dragées, bouquets, eggs, oranges and flowers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随着时间的前进，骚动喧嚣也愈来愈厉害了。在人行道上，在马车里，在窗口里，没有哪一条舌头是静止的，没有哪一只手臂是不动的。这是一场人为的风暴，是雷声般的叫喊，千万人的欢呼，鲜花，蛋壳，橘子和花球所组成的风暴。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The races, like the moccoli, are a particular feature of the last days of carnival. At the sound of these cannon, the carriages instantly broke ranks and each headed for the side-street nearest wherever they happened to be. All these manoeuvres take place with unbelievable skill and wonderful speed, without the police bothering in the slightest to assign anyone to a post or to show anyone where he should go. Those on foot pressed themselves against the palazzi. Then a great sound of horses' hoofs and rattling of sabres was heard.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="赛马象“长生烛”一样，也是狂欢节最后一天所特有的插曲之一。花爆的声音一响，马车便立刻散开行列，隐入邻近的横街小巷里去。这一切动作都熟练得令人难以相信，而且极其神速，警察也不必来干预此事。徒步的游人都齐齐贴墙排起来，接着就听到了马蹄的践踏声和铁器的撞击声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Almost at once, in the midst of a vast, universal, inconceivable clamour, they saw seven or eight horses go past like wraiths, driven on by the cheering of three hundred thousand voices and the metal castanets clattering on their backs.

<div class="line_en">This wild, blazing dash lasted some two hours. The Corso was lit as if in broad daylight and the features of the spectators' faces could be distinguished up to the third or fourth storey. Every five minutes Albert took out his watch. At last, it showed seven o'clock.</div>

<div class="line_en">The steps were crowded with bystanders and masked figures struggling to take the candles from each other's hands. Franz watched Albert as he went, and he saw him put his foot on the first step; almost at once a masked figure, wearing the familiar costume of the peasant girl with the bouquet, reached out and took his moccoletto, without Albert this time offering any resistance. Franz was too far away to hear what they said, but her words were doubtless reassuring, for he saw Albert and the girl walk off, arm in arm. For a time he followed them through the crowd, but he lost sight of them at the Via Macello.</div>
