<div class="line_en">He smiled at her, waiting for the rest of the question, but Dylan didn't continue. It didn't really matter. The door was there now, and whatever was through it, that was what she needed to concentrate on. It was just all so confusing.</div>

<div class="line_en">She didn't have time to question Caeli about the strange, deleted lines, however. He moved just a few metres to a door fitted snugly in a wall which may or may not have been there a moment earlier. Dylan wasn't sure. She frowned and rubbed at her forehead, disoriented.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她还没来得及问萨利这些被删除的奇怪条目是怎么回事，他已经朝一扇门走出几米远了，迪伦甚至不确定这扇嵌在墙里的暗门刚才到底是否存在。她眉头紧皱，摸着额头，感到有些困惑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Caeli hadn't argued or asked Dylan for a reason behind her odd request. Instead he had held out an arm, gesturing through the library. Dylan hesitated, taking one last look at the page before she followed him. Something caught her eye just before she ripped her gaze away. There, right at the bottom of the page, was another of those curious entries. Another soul blacked out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="面对迪伦这个古怪的请求，萨利既没有争辩也没有请她说出自己的理由。他只是伸出一只胳膊，示意她穿过图书馆。迪伦犹豫了一下，在跟着他走之前，最后再看了一眼那页。她的目光尚未离去，书页上又有东西吸引了她的注意。就在页底上又有一条奇怪的记录，又有一个灵魂的名字被涂黑了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Was that…" she started, turning back to Caeli.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Through there?" she asked, pointing to the solid-looking door. It was dark, maybe mahogany, and inlaid with elegantly carved panelling, fitting in with the grand surroundings. The handle was small and round, made of burnished brass.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“要穿过去吗？”她指着看起来很结实的门问道。深色的门可能是红木做的，上面的镶板精雕细琢，跟富丽堂皇的外观相得益彰。黄铜材质的门把手小巧混圆，被擦得锃亮。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A street. Dylan was instantly more comfortable. The buildings were like nothing she had ever seen, though: a world apart from the high, uniform red-sandstone tenement blocks of Glasgow. Row upon row of neat, single-storey homes, with well-manicured front lawns and pretty flowerbeds stretched out before her. Vehicles, almost all a glossy black with long, curved bonnets and shining silver platforms running along their flanks, were parked on driveways or at the kerb, like something out of the old movies Joan sometimes made her watch when they had one of their many elderly neighbours over for dinner. The sun was splitting the sky and there was a quiet, companionable hum about the place.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="里面是一条街道。迪伦顿感轻松，不过里面的建筑物跟自己见过的完全不同—这里和格拉斯哥那些高高耸立、整齐划一的红砂岩公寓大楼有天壤之别。一排排整洁优雅的单层小楼，修剪得整整齐齐的前庭草坪和漂亮的花圃映入眼帘。停在车道或街边的车辆几乎是清一色黑亮的轿车，长引擎盖带着弧度，两侧的上车踏板闪着银光。迪伦家里有时候会请一位上了年纪的邻居过来吃饭，琼会叫迪伦陪他们看看老电影，眼前的这些车就跟片子里的一模一样。阳光正露出云霄，此地传来沉静和谐的沉吟声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Caeli nodded. Dylan waited for him to open it for her -- not that she was used to gentlemanly manners, but he seemed to be in charge here -- but he didn't move. Was this another one of those things she had to do herself, like crossing the line in the wasteland? Looking at the being for reassurance, she tentatively stretched out a hand and grasped the doorknob. It turned easily in her hand, and Caeli stepped back so that she could swing it wide open. She did so, giving the being one more nervous glance before she stepped through and took in her surroundings.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="萨利点点头。迪伦等着他为自己开门—不是因为自己习惯于别人的绅士风度，而是这里的一切似乎都在萨利的管控之中。然而他没有动，莫非这次又必须由她自己来完成，就像跨越荒原上那道分界线一样？她看着萨利像是要得到一点安慰，然后试探着伸出手抓住了门把手。她轻轻一拧门就开了，萨利往后退了几步，好让迪伦把门完全敞开。迪伦打开了门，又紧张地看了一眼萨利，然后走了进去，观察里面的环境。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She took a quick second to memorise the pot of yellow and orange flowers to the right of the single step, the brass number nine nailed dead centre in the door, above a narrow letterbox. Certain she'd be able to find the house again, she went back to staring at the street in front of her. There was a tinny sound ringing in her ears that she strained to recognise. It hissed a little, but beneath this she could hear the beats and chimes of a melody. It was like listening to a radio that wasn't quite tuned in. She followed the sound, weaving through the cars until she came to a pair of legs sticking out from underneath a gleaming black vehicle. The noise was louder here and she realised she had been right: an ancient-looking radio -- what her granny would have called a wireless -- was propped on the top of the car. One foot bobbed in time with the music, an oldies tune Dylan didn't recognise.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她很快记住了台阶右边黄色和橙色的花盆、钉在门中央的9号铜牌，还有上方狭窄的邮箱，这下子她肯定能找回来了。她转身凝视着前方的街道，耳边响起一种细小的声音，迪伦费力地想听清楚。这声音有点嘶嘶作响，但这种声音背后还能听到一段旋律中的节奏和鸣响，就好像在听还没有调好波段的收音机。她循声在汽车之间来回穿梭，终于看到从一辆闪闪发光的黑色轿车下面伸出来的两条腿。这里的噪声比别处都要响，她发觉自己刚才的直觉完全正确，那里有一台放着老歌的模样古旧的收音机—她的祖母会管这个叫无线电—搁在车顶上，那人有一只脚还在伴着音乐的节拍上下摆动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan stepped forward onto a neatly paved path that wound through a tidy lawn. There was a soft click behind her and she turned to see the door close. She seemed to have exited from one of the buildings; a detached house with dormer windows and exterior walls clad in a dark wood. Caeli was nowhere to be seen, but Dylan had a feeling that all she had to do was remember the door to find her way back through to the records room again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦踏上一条铺设整齐的小道，迂回穿过一块干净的草坪。身后传来轻轻的咔嗒声，她转身一看，入口那扇门关上了，让她觉得自己是刚从屋里出来。这是一栋独立的建筑，上面有屋顶窗，外墙上包着黑色的木料。萨利不知所踪，然而迪伦感觉自己所能做的就是记住这个门，好找到重新穿回记录室的路。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="她不知道自己是不是已经找到了乔纳斯。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Hello?" she called, bending down slightly to squint under the car. She couldn't see much, just more legs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你好？”她微微弓下腰蹲在车下跟那人打招呼，还是只能看到腿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was baby-faced, that was the first thing to register with Dylan. Smooth, rounded cheeks sat below twinkling blue eyes; his blond hair was neatly combed, split in a side parting, but several locks had twisted out of place, sticking up at odd angles and making him look even more childlike. It was an odd face to sit atop a man's body that was tall with broad shoulders.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他长着一张娃娃脸，这是迪伦对他的最初印象。光滑的圆脸颊上一双蓝眼睛闪烁着，他的金发整齐地梳成了偏分，但还是有几缕头发不肯归位，以一个很奇特的角度翘了起来，让他看上去更加孩子气。如此高大的身体和宽阔的肩膀之上却长着这么一张娃娃脸，真是匪夷所思。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The foot stopped jiggling. After a second, there was a scrabbling sound and the legs extended, merging into a body and then, finally, an oil-smeared face. Dylan waited as he drew himself up to stand before her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但那条腿不再晃了。一秒钟后，传来刮擦的声音。迪伦先是看到那双腿伸长了，随后看到了那人的上身，最后是一张油亮的脸。他慢慢起身，站在了迪伦身前。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan was sure this was the soul she was looking for. He wasn't how she had imagined him, but this was definitely him, Jonas. She remembered suddenly that he was German and wondered if she'd be able to speak to him. She'd studied French in school, but her German was limited to counting to five.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦知道这就是自己正在寻找的灵魂。他跟自己想象中的不一样，不过这个确实就是他—乔纳斯。她突然想起来他是德国人，心里有些疑惑，不知道自己能否跟他交流。她在学校学过法语，但她的德语仅限于会从一数到五。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你刚来这儿没多久，是吗？”他的英语听上去非常地道，只是稍稍带一点口音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You're Jonas," she said. It wasn't a question, but he nodded anyway. "I'm Dylan."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你是乔纳斯。”她说。这不是一个问句，但他还是点了点头，“我是迪伦。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh." Dylan blushed, realising she'd somehow made a faux pas. "Sorry, no. I just arrived."</div>

<div class="line_en">He smiled a little wider in sympathy. "I can understand you," he assured her.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a moment's pause then. Jonas watched her patiently, his face politely surprised and not a little intrigued. Dylan grimaced and fidgeted on the spot. Why had she asked to see him? What did she want to ask? She was so muddled, off-balance, she couldn't get it quite straight in her head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="沉默了片刻后，乔纳斯开始耐心地打量起迪伦来。他的表情既客气又带着吃惊，还非常好奇。迪伦表情有些不自然，感觉坐立不安。她为什么要求来见他呢？她想问他什么呢？她自己也稀里糊涂，毫无准备，自己脑子里也没想清楚。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Whatever Jonas had been expecting, it wasn't that. He blinked, frowned, but gestured with a jerk of his chin that she should continue. Dylan played with her tongue between her teeth, biting down until it was almost painful. What did she want to know?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不论乔纳斯之前如何揣测，也没想到她会问这个。他眨了眨眼，眉头微皱，但还是点了点头，示意迪伦继续。迪伦在齿间摆弄着舌头，使劲咬下去，直到咬痛才松开。她到底想知道些什么呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He was called Tristan?" she asked. Best to start simply.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他是不是叫崔斯坦？”她觉得最好先从简单的开始问起。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh," Dylan managed to mumble, trying unsuccessfully to swallow back her disappointment. Maybe it wasn't him, then. Maybe Caeli had been wrong.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦。”迪伦嘀咕着，尽量想把自己的失望咽下去，但是还是掩饰不住。那么或许并不是他，也许是萨利搞错了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No," he said, shaking his head slowly, looking as if he was recalling things from long ago. "No, his name was Henrik."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不是。”他慢慢摇了摇头，像是在回忆很久以前的往事，“不，他的名字叫亨里克。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“他长什么样子呢？”她问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don't know, normal, I suppose." Jonas shrugged, as if the question was hard to answer. "He looked like any other soldier. Tall, brown hair, the uniform."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不知该怎么说，我觉得就是普通人的长相吧。”乔纳斯耸耸肩，好像这个问题很难回答，“他看起来跟其他士兵没什么区别。高个子，棕色头发，身穿军服。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I remember…" He huffed a breath and grinned suddenly. "I remember he had bluer eyes than anyone I had ever seen. I teased him about it, how he looked the quintessential Nazi soldier with eyes like that. They were the strangest colour."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我想起来了……”他突然长叹一口气，咧开嘴笑了，“我想起来了，他有一双蓝色的眼睛，我从来没见过那样的眼睛。我当时还逗他说，怎么他看起来那么像最纯正的纳粹士兵，有双这样的眼睛。那双眼的颜色是最奇特不过的了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Cobalt blue," Dylan whispered, seeing the blaze of colour in her head as clearly as if he were standing in front of her. The face surrounding the eyes was a little fuzzy, fading into the distance already, but the cold heat of his stare still burned into her. That was him; that was Tristan. She smiled a tiny smile to herself. At least that one thing was real.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“钴蓝色[1]。”迪伦喃喃自语。这颜色马上在她的脑海闪烁起来，历历在目，仿佛他就站在自己身边一样。眼睛周围的面部已经有点模糊了，正在逐渐淡出视线，然而他那冷热交织的目光却依然深深烙在她的心头。就是他，就是崔斯坦，她露出了一丝浅笑。至少这个是真实的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Perhaps he changed his name for each soul he encountered, picking a name he thought they would like. She remembered what he'd said, about how he had to make them follow, reddening as his words echoed in her mind, telling her she should fancy him. She'd liked the name Tristan; it had seemed oldy-worldy, mysterious. Very different to the David and Darren and Jordan clones at Kaithshall. Was that just another part of his job, another piece of the deception? She felt her chest tighten as she realised with a sudden rush of sadness that she might not even have known his real name. If he had one.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="也许他每遇到一个灵魂，就会换一个自己认为最合适的名字。她想起以前他说过的话，怎样才能让他们跟着他走，比如他曾刻意让迪伦对自己产生好感。想起这些，迪伦的脸又红了。她喜欢崔斯坦这个名字，听起来成熟稳重、老于世故，还带着点神秘，和吉斯夏尔中学里大卫、达伦、乔丹之类扎堆的烂俗名字完全不同。这也是他工作的一部分吗？是他的另一个手段吗？她突然意识到，即使他有一个真实的名字，自己也可能无从知道了。想到这里，一丝哀怨涌上心头，她感觉心口有点堵得慌。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Right," Jonas agreed, smiling at her. "Cobalt blue. That is a good description of them."</div>

<div class="line_en">"What… what was he like?" Unconsciously, Dylan raised a hand to her face and started to chew on one of her fingernails. Now that she was coming to the important questions, she was suddenly edgy, not sure she wanted the answers, frightened to hear something she wouldn't like.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他……他是什么样子呢？”迪伦下意识地举起一只手，开始咬手指。现在问到了最关键的问题，她突然有些焦躁不安，不确定自己到底想不想知道答案了，她害怕听到自己不愿意听到的内容。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦身子侧向一边，缓缓从乔纳斯身边离去。他仍然注视着她，眼中满是同情。但看着他眼中黯然神伤的自己更让迪伦痛苦，她现在只想离开他，找一个安静的去处躲起来，把脑子里那一团乱麻理清楚。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan stared at him, disappointed. He was right; he didn't understand. Couldn't. In fact, she could probably go through every name in Tristan's book and still not find a soul who had felt what she felt, who knew what it was like to have this gnawing pain that churned in her stomach, like a vital part of her was missing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦失望地看着他。他说得没错，他不理解自己的情感，理解不了。实际上，她有可能即使遍访崔斯坦名册上的每一个灵魂，还是找不出一个能跟自己感同身受的灵魂，他们无法理解此刻她心中翻腾的那种刻骨铭心的痛楚，那种感觉就像失去了要害部位一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That was both a comforting thought and a depressing one.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="想到这些，既让她略感宽慰，更让她悲不自胜。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“嗨，谢谢你听我说话。我想……我想该让你回到你的车那儿去了，你正在修车是吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yeah." Jonas grinned a little impishly, his chubby cheeks made his eyes all but disappear. "I always wanted a car when I was alive." His choice of words jarred with Dylan, but she kept her expression impassive. "Now I can play all I want. Though I think it would run whatever I did to it. Still, I like to pretend I'm making a difference. I was so excited when I crossed over and saw it, I almost didn't notice at first that I was back in Stuttgart!" He gave Dylan a slightly sad smile. "At least that is one thing about this place… going home."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是。”乔纳斯有些顽皮地笑了笑，胖嘟嘟的脸蛋几乎把他的眼都挤成了一条缝，“我活着的时候总是想买辆车。”他的用词在迪伦听来很别扭，但是她仍然是一副面无表情的样子。“现在我可以买得起自己想要的东西了。尽管我觉得不管我对它做什么它都会跑起来，但我还是喜欢假装这一切跟我有关系。我从荒原穿过来看到它的时候简直太激动了，一开始我几乎都没注意到自己回到了斯图加特！”他向迪伦报以略带伤感的微笑，“这里至少有一点是好的……让我回家了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'm not supposed to be here," she murmured, more to herself than Jonas. She shifted away from him. She wanted to be alone. Alone to think; alone to cry. She forced false brightness into her voice. "Well, have fun with your car. Thanks again." Dylan was off before the final word was out of her mouth, quick steps taking her away, eyes searching out the flower pots, the brass number nine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不应该待在这儿。”她小声嘀咕着，与其说是说给乔纳斯听的，还不如说是自言自语。她开始要抽身而去，想一个人待一会儿，一个人思考，一个人哭泣。她从声音里强打精神，“好吧，好好摆弄你的车吧。再次感谢。”最后一个词尚未出口，她就已经快步走开，开始用眼睛搜索着那个花盆和9号铜门牌。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That was not worth waiting a lifetime for. If she knew Tristan was coming, then maybe she could bear to linger here. But that wasn't going to happen. He was never, ever coming. That thought sent a jolt of agony right into her core and she shut her eyes against the pain of it. Tristan. She could still recall with crystal clarity the burning feeling of his lips pressing against hers, his arms tight around her. How ironic that that moment was the most alive she'd ever felt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不值得为这样的等待付出一生的时间。如果她知道崔斯坦终将到来，那么或许她可以忍受在这里徘徊的孤寂。可那样的事不会发生，他永远、永远不会到这里来。想到这里，她感到一阵钻心的痛楚，只能紧闭双眼强忍剧痛。崔斯坦，她仍能无比清晰地回忆起被他亲吻、被他拥紧时那炽热的感觉。那一刻是她有生以来感觉最亢奋的一刻，真是天大的讽刺。">查看中文翻译</div>
