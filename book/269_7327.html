<div class="line_en">I was like a lost moon -- my planet destroyed in some cataclysmic, disaster-movie scenario of desolation -- that continued, nevertheless, to circle in a tight little orbit around the empty space left behind, ignoring the laws of gravity.</div>

<div class="line_en">Time began to trip along much more quickly than before. School, work, and Jacob -- though not necessarily in that order -- created a neat and effortless pattern to follow. And Charlie got his wish: I wasn't miserable anymore. Of course, I couldn't fool myself completely. When I stopped to take stock of my life, which I tried not to do too often, I couldn't ignore the implications of my behavior.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="时间开始比以前流逝的更快了。学校、工作和雅各布——虽然未必是按照这种次序——构成了我所遵循的简单和轻松的模式。并且查理也如愿以偿：我已经不再郁郁寡欢。当然，我没法完全欺骗自己。每当我停下来思考着我的人生时，我努力试着不要太常这么做，我没法忽视我那些举止的隐含意义。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I was getting better with my bike, which meant fewer bandages to worry Charlie. But it also meant that the voice in my head began to fade, until I heard it no more. Quietly, I panicked. I threw myself into the search for the meadow with slightly frenzied intensity. I racked my brain for other adrenaline-producing activities.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我骑摩托车的水平提高了不少，那意味着我会更少受伤而不会让查理担心。但是那同时也意味着我脑海中的声音开始逐步消失，直到我再也听不到了。静悄悄的，我恐慌起来。我带着稍许狂热的感情去寻找那片草地。绞尽脑汁的寻找着其它能够产生肾上腺素的方法。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I didn't keep track of the days : hat passed -- there was no reason, as I tried to live as much in the present as possible, no past fading, no future impending. So I was surprised by the date when Jacob brought it up on one of our homework days. He was waiting when I pulled up in front of his house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我无心留意那些已经流逝的时光——毫无理由这么做，因为我努力的尽可能活在当下，既不去想那些消逝的过去，也不期待即将到来的明天。所以在我们约好做功课的一天，雅各布提到某个具体日子时我很惊讶。当我把车停在他家门口时他正在那等着我。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh, well, if that's all…" I took the candy. But I was trying to think of some way to make the boundaries clear. Again. They seemed to get blurred a lot with Jacob.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，好吧，如果是那样的话……”我接过糖果。但是，我正尝试着用其它的办法来划清我们之间的界限。再一次。我和雅各布之间的界限看起来模糊了很多。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我开始感觉不自在。这些话是在开玩笑，但是仅仅只是表面上如此。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Happy Valentine's Day," Jacob said, smiling, but ducking his head as he greeted me.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jacob shook his head with mock sadness. "You can be so out of it sometimes. Yes, it is the fourteenth day of February. So are you going to be my Valentine? Since you didn't get me a fifty-cent box of candy, it's the least you can do."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雅各布假装难过的摇了摇头。“你有时候太不合常理了。是的，今天是二月十四日。那么你会成为我的情人吗？既然你都没为我准备一盒五十美分的糖果，至少你也得那么做了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'm going to a movie Friday. I've been promising my cafeteria crowd that I would go out forever." Mike would be pleased.</div>

<div class="line_en">"You'll come too, right?" I added quickly. "Or will it be too much of a drag with a bunch of boring seniors?" So much for my chance to put some distance between us. I couldn't stand hurting Jacob; we seemed to be connected in an odd way, and his pain set off little stabs of my own. Also, the idea of having his company for the ordeal -- I had promised Mike, but really didn't feel any enthusiasm at the thought of following through -- was just too tempting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你也会来，对吧？”我立即补充到。“或者你觉得跟一群乏味高年级学生在一起很无趣？”利用这个机会使我们之间保持一些距离看起来已经不太可能了。我无法忍受自己去伤害雅各布，奇怪的是我们好像联系在一起，他受伤我也会感到疼痛。况且让他陪我一起去赴那场痛苦的约会——我已经答应了迈克，但我实在找不到任何热情来履行这个约定——简直太有诱惑力了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But Jacob's face fell. I caught the expression in his dark eyes before he dropped them to look at the ground.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是雅各布的脸色沉了下来。在他低下头来掩饰他的心情之前，我已经在他黑黑的眼珠里捕捉到了他的表情。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I broached the subject with Mike in English.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“嗨，迈克，”下课时我对他说。“你星期五晚上有空吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Sure," he agreed, visibly less eager.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然，”他同意了，明显没那么热切了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He looked up, his blue eyes instantly hopeful. "Yeah, I am. You want to go out?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他抬起头看着我，他的蓝眼睛里立即充满了希望。“是的，我有空。你想出去玩吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I worded my reply carefully. "I was thinking about getting a group" -- I emphasized the word -- "together to go see Crosshairs." I'd done my homework this time -- even reading the movie spoilers to be sure I wouldn't be caught off guard. This movie was supposed to be a bloodbath from start to finish. I wasn't so recovered that I could stand to sit through a romance. "Does that sound like fun?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我小心翼翼的回答他。“我想组织一个集体活动”——我强调着这个词——“一起去看《瞄准射击》吧。”这一次我已经事先做好准备工作了——甚至还阅读了剧透，确保自己不会再毫无准备。这部电影应该是从头到尾都是杀戮的血腥场面。我还没有恢复到可以忍受看完一部爱情片。“这是不是听起来很有趣？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Cool."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“真酷。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After a second, he perked back up to near his former excitement level. "How about we get Angela and Ben? Or Eric and Katie?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过了一会，他又活跃起来，几乎和开始一样兴奋。“不如我们叫上安吉拉和本？或者是埃里克和凯蒂？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Okay," Mike muttered, foiled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好的，”迈克咕噜道，有些挫败。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was determined to make this some kind of double date, apparently.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="很明显，他决心要把这次聚会变成几对情侣间的约会。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"How about both?" I suggested "And Jessica, too, of course. And Tyler and Conner, and maybe Lauren," I tacked on grudgingly. I had promised Quil variety.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yep, the very ones," I answered cheerfully. "Though you could look at it as tutoring -- they're only sophomores."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，正是他们，”我开心的回答道。“但是你也可以把它看做是功课辅导——他们才上二年级。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The diminished numbers didn't dampen Mike's anticipation, though. It was all he could talk about Friday.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="即使这样，人数的减少并没有影响迈克的期待。他一整天谈论的都是星期五的事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jessica and Lauren claimed to be busy as soon as Mike let it slip that I was involved in the planning. Eric and Katie already had plans -- it was their three-week anniversary or something. Lauren got to Tyler and Conner before Mike could, so those two were also busy. Even Quil was out -- grounded for fighting at school. In the end, only Angela and Ben, and, of course Jacob, were able to go.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当迈克无意中提到是我安排了这次活动时，杰西卡和劳伦就声称她们没空。埃里克和凯蒂已经有安排了——那天是他们交往三周的纪念日，或者其它的什么日子。劳伦在迈克之前就把这个安排告诉了泰勒和康纳，所以他俩也没空。甚至奎尔也来不了了——因为在学校打架而被禁止出门。最后，只有安吉拉和本，当然还要雅各布，可以去了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Are you sure you don't want to see Tomorrow and Forever instead?" he asked at lunch, naming the current romantic comedy that was ruling the box office. "Rotten Tomatoes gave it a better review."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Hey, Bella," he greeted me, and then his eyes turned wary as he looked up at Jacob. I glanced briefly at Jacob, too, trying to be objective. He really didn't look like a sophomore at all.

<div class="line_en">I fell asleep on the towel again, but when I woke up I was in my bed and it was light outside my window. I didn't remember moving; Charlie must have carried me to my room -- he'd also put the glass of water on my bedside table. I felt parched. I chugged it down, though it tasted funny from sitting stagnant all night.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我又靠在毛巾上睡着了，但是当我醒过来的时候我已经躺在我床上了，窗外有些光亮。我不记得自己移动过。一定是查理把我抱进房间的——他仍然放了一杯水在我床边的桌子上。我感到口渴。我咕噜咕噜的把水喝了下去，虽然它放了一晚上味道有些奇怪。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“迈克感觉好多了，”他朝楼上对我喊道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Well, that was encouraging. He'd only gotten sick eight hours or so before me. Eight more hours. The thought made my stomach turn, and I pulled myself up to lean over the toilet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="噢，真是振奋人心的好消息。他只比我提前了大约八个小时生的病。还有八个小时我也会好转了。想到这里我的胃又开始翻腾起来，我直起身子靠在马桶边上。">查看中文翻译</div>
