<div class="line_en">In days now forgotten, its world had been overturned. Soil had taken flight, leaving a broad and deep chasm, and then soil had come crashing down to fill it back in. At one end of the disturbed earth stood a lone black formation. Such things happened frequently throughout this vast domain, the soil flying away and returning, chasms opening up and being filled, and rock formations appearing like visible markers of each catastrophic change. Under the setting sun, the ant and hundreds of its brethren had carried off the surviving queen to establish a new empire.</div>

<div class="line_en">Its return visit was only a chance passing while searching for food. The ant arrived at the foot of the formation, sensing its indomitable presence with its feelers. Noting that the surface was hard and slippery, yet still climbable, up it went, with no purpose in mind but the random turbulence of its simple neural network. Turbulence was everywhere, within every blade of grass, every drop of dew on a leaf, every cloud in the sky, and every star beyond. The turbulence was purposeless, but in huge quantities of purposeless turbulence, purpose took shape.</div>

<div class="line_en">The ant sensed vibrations in the ground and knew from how they intensified that another giant presence was approaching from somewhere on the ground. Paying it no mind, the ant continued its climb up the formation. At the right angle where the foot of the formation met the ground, there was a spider web. This, the ant knew. It carefully detoured around the sticky hanging strands, passing by the spider lying in wait, its legs extended to feel for vibrations in the threads. Each knew of the other's presence but -- as it had been for eons -- there was no communication.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="褐蚁感到了地面的震动，从震动由弱变强的趋势来判断，它知道地面上的另一个巨大的存在正在向这里运动，它没有理会，继续向孤峰上攀爬。在孤峰底部和地面形成的直角空间里有一面蛛网，褐蚁知道那是什么，它小心地绕过了粘在悬崖上的蛛丝，从那个缩起所有的腿静等着蛛丝震动的蜘蛛旁经过，它们彼此都感觉到了对方的存在，但同过去的一亿年一样，双方没有任何交流。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The vibrations crescendoed and then stopped. The giant being had reached the formation. It was far taller than the ant and blotted out most of the sky. The ant was not unfamiliar with beings of this sort. It knew that they were alive, that they frequently appeared in this region, and that their appearances were closely related to the swiftly disappearing chasms and multiplying formations.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="震动达到高峰后停止了，那个巨大的存在已经来到了孤峰前，褐蚁看到这个存在比孤峰还要高许多，遮住了很大一部分天空。对这类存在褐蚁并不陌生，它知道他们是活的，常常出现在这片疆域，那些出现后很快就消失的峡谷和越来越多地耸现的孤峰，都与他们有着密切的关系。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The ant continued its climb, knowing that the beings were not a threat, with a few exceptions. Down below, the spider encountered one such exception when the being, which had evidently noticed its web reaching between the formation and the ground, whisked away the spider and web with the stems of a bundle of flowers it held in one limb, causing them to land broken in a pile of weeds. Then the being gently placed the flowers in front of the formation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="褐蚁继续向上攀登，它知道这类存在一般不会威胁到自己——当然也有例外。对于已处于下方的那个蜘蛛，这种例外已经出现，那个存在显然发现了孤峰与地面之间的蛛网，用一个肢体上拿着的一束花的花柄拂去了它，蜘蛛随着断开的蛛丝落到了草丛中。然后，他把花轻轻地放在了孤峰前。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then another vibration, weak but intensifying, told the ant that a second living being of the same sort was moving toward the formation. At the same time, the ant encountered a long trough, a depression in the surface of the formation with a rougher texture and different color: off-white. It followed the trough, for its roughness made for a far easier climb. At each end was a short, thinner trough: a horizontal base from which the main trough rose, and an upper trough that extended at an angle. By the time the ant climbed back out onto the slick black surface, it had gained an overall impression of the shape of the troughs: "1."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时。另一个震动出现了，很微弱，但也在增强中。褐蚁知道，另一个同类型的存在正在向孤峰移动。与此同时，在前方的峭壁上，它遇到了一道长长的沟槽，与峭壁表面相比，沟槽的凹面粗糙一些，颜色也不同，呈灰白色，它沿着沟槽爬，粗糙的表面使攀登容易了许多。沟槽的两端都有短小的细槽。下端的细槽与主槽垂直，上端的细槽则与主槽成一个角度相交。当褐蚁重新踏上蛸壁光滑的黑色表面后，它对槽的整体形状有了一个印象：“1”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then the height of the being in front of formation was cut in half, so it was roughly even with the formation. Evidently it had dropped to its knees, revealing a patch of dim blue sky where the stars had begun to come out behind it. The being's eyes gazed at the top of the formation, causing the ant to hesitate momentarily while deciding whether it ought to intrude into his line of sight. Instead, it changed direction and started crawling parallel with the ground, quickly reaching another trough and lingering in its rough depression as it savored the pleasant sensation of the crawl. The color was reminiscent of the eggs that surrounded its queen. With no hesitation, the ant followed the trough downward, and after a while, the layout become more complicated, a curve extended beneath a complete circle. It reminded the ant of the process of searching out scent information and eventually stumbling across the way home. A pattern was established in its neural network: "9."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，孤峰前的活着的存在突然矮了一半，与孤峰的高度相当了，他显然是蹲下了，在露出的那片暗蓝的天空中，星星已经开始稀疏地出现。他的眼睛看着孤峰的上端，褐蚁犹豫了一下，决定还是不要直接进入他的视线，于是转向沿着与地面平行的方向爬。很快，它遇到了另一道沟槽，它很留恋沟槽那粗糙的凹面，在上面爬行感觉很好，同时槽面的颜色也让它想起了蚁后周围的蚁卵。它不惜向下走回头路，沿着槽爬了一趟。这道槽的形状要复杂些，很弯曲，转了一个完整的圈后再向下延伸一段，让它想起在对气味信息的搜寻后终于找到了回家的路的过程，它在自己的神经网络中建立起了它的形状：“9”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then the being kneeling before the formation made a sound, a series of sounds that far exceeded the ant's capacity to comprehend: "It's a wonder to be alive. If you don't understand that, how can you search for anything deeper?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，蹲在孤峰前的存在发出了声音，这串远超出褐蚁理解力的话是这样的：“活着本身就很妙，如果连这道理都不懂，怎么去探索更深的东西呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The ant continued to crawl parallel to the ground and entered a third trough, one that was nearly vertical until it turned, like this: "7." The ant didn't like this shape. A sharp, sudden turn usually meant danger or battle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="褐蚁继续沿着与地面平行的方向爬，进入了第三道沟槽，它是一个近似于直角的转弯，是这样的：“7”。它不喜欢这形状，平时，这种不平滑的、突然的转向，往往意味着危险和战斗。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The first being's voice had obscured the vibrations, so it was only now that the ant realized that the second being had reached the formation. Shorter and frailer, the second being had white hair that stood out against the dark blue background of the sky, bobbing silver in the wind, connected somehow to the increasing number of stars.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="话声掩盖了震动，褐蚁这时才感觉到第二个活着的存在已经来到了孤峰前，第一个存在站起来就是为了迎接她。第二个存在比第一个要矮小瘦弱许多，有一头白发，白发在暮空暗蓝的背景上很醒目，那团在微风中拂动的银色似乎与空中越来越多的星星有某种联系。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Down on the formation, the ant wanted to turn toward the sky, but then discovered another trough ahead of it, identical to the "9"-shaped trough it had crawled through before the "7." So it continued horizontally through the "9," which it found better than both the "7" and the "1." although it could not say exactly why. Its aesthetic sense was primitive and single-celled. The indistinct pleasure it had felt upon crawling through the "9" intensified. A primitive, single-celled state of happiness. These two spiritual monocells, aesthetics and pleasure had never evolved. They had been the same a billion years ago, and would be the same a billion years hence.</div>

It had hoped, after crawling out of the "-" depression, to find a pleasurable "9," but instead it encountered a "2," with a comfortable initial curve but a sharp turn at the end that was as fearsome as that of the "7." The premonition of an uncertain future. The ant continued onward to the next trough, a closed shape: "0." The path seemed like part of a "9," but it was a trap.

Twilight still illuminated the west, and they could still count the stars that had come out, making it easy to remember how the firmament had looked a few moments ago: a vast expanse and a blue void, or a face without pupils, like a marble statue. Now, though the stars were few in number, the giant eyes had pupils. The void was filled. The universe had sight. The stars were tiny, just single twinkling points of silver that hinted at some unease on the part of its creator. The cosmic sculptor had felt compelled to dot pupils onto the universe, yet had a tremendous terror of granting it sight. This balance of fear and desire resulted in the tininess of the stars against the hugeness of space, a declaration of caution above all.</div>

After navigating its twists and turns, it established another pattern in its simple consciousness: the Chinese character -- mu, meaning "grave," although the character and its meaning were not known to the ant. Farther up was another combination of troughs -- far simpler this time, but to continue its exploration the ant had no choice but to clear its memory and forget the mu. Then it entered a wonderful line-trough, a shape that reminded it of the abdomen of a recently deceased cricket it had discovered not long ago. It quickly made out the new structure:, zhi, the Chinese possessive modifier. Then, as it continued upward, it encountered two more trough combinations, the first of which consisted of two droplet-shaped depressions and a cricket stomach: the character -- dong, meaning "winter." The top one was split into two parts, which together formed the character -- yang, meaning "poplar." This was the last shape the ant remembered, and the only one it retained from its entire journey.

It knew that its tiny neural net had no way to store such a thing, but after determining the overall shape of the image, its primitive one-cell aesthetic was as sparked as it had been by the sense of the "9." And somehow it seemed to recognize part of the image, a pair of eyes. The ant was sensitive to eyes, because their gaze meant danger. Yet it felt no anxiety now, for it knew the eyes were lifeless. It had already forgotten that when the giant being named Luo Ji knelt down in silence before the formation, he had been looking at those eyes. The ant climbed out of the basin and up onto the formation's peak. It felt no sense of towering above its surroundings, because it had no fear of falling. It had been blown off of places higher than this many times without any injury. Without the fear of heights, there can be no appreciation for the beauty of high places.</div>
