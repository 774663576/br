<div class="line_en">"All right," said Grandpa Joe, when the whole family was gathered in the old people's room after supper, "let's hear who found them."</div>

<div class="line_en">"The third ticket," read Mr Bucket, holding the newspaper up close to his face because his eyes were bad and he couldn't afford glasses, "the third ticket was found by a Miss Violet Beauregarde. There was great excitement in the Beauregarde household when our reporter arrived to interview the lucky young lady -- cameras were clicking and flashbulbs were flashing and people were pushing and jostling and trying to get a bit closer to the famous girl. And the famous girl was standing on a chair in the living room waving the Golden Ticket madly at arm's length as though she were flagging a taxi. She was talking very fast and very loudly to everyone, but it was not easy to hear all that she said because she was chewing so ferociously upon a piece of gum at the same time."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“第三张奖券，”巴克特先生念道，他把报纸凑到脸前，因为他的视力不好，又买不起眼镜戴，“第三张奖券由维奥莉特·博雷加德小姐找到。当我们的记者来到博雷加德家访问这位幸运的年轻小姐时，她家正热闹非凡——摄影机咔嚓咔嚓地响，闪光灯闪个不停，人们又推又搡，想更靠近这位出了名的小姐一点儿。这位出了名的小姐正站在客厅里的一把椅子上，举起手臂拼命地挥动那张金奖券，好像在挥手叫出租汽车似的。她又快又响地对大家说话，但是要听清楚她所有的话实在不容易，因为她同时在拼命地大嚼一片口香糖。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"'Now, Violet,' Mrs Beauregarde said from a far corner of the room where she was standing on the piano to avoid being trampled by the mob."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“‘好了，维奥莉特。’博雷加德太太说。她在房间远远的一角，正站在钢琴上面，怕被人群踩着。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"'I'm a gum chewer, normally,' she shouted, 'but when I heard about these ticket things of Mr Wonka's, I gave up gum and started on chocolate bars in the hope of striking lucky. Now, of course, I'm back on gum. I just adore gum. I can't do without it. I munch it all day long except for a few minutes at mealtimes when I take it out and stick it behind my ear for safekeeping. To tell you the truth, I simply wouldn't feel comfortable if I didn't have that little wedge of gum to chew on every moment of the day, I really wouldn't. My mother says it's not ladylike and it looks ugly to see a girl's jaws going up and down like mine do all the time, but I don't agree. And who's she to criticize, anyway, because if you ask me, I'd say that her jaws are going up and down almost as much as mine are just from yelling at me every minute of the day.'"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“‘其实我爱嚼口香糖，’她大叫着说，‘但是一听说旺卡先生的这些奖券，我就不嚼口香糖，开始改吃巧克力糖了，希望能幸运地得到奖券。现在，我当然回过头来吃我的口香糖。我就是热爱口香糖。我不能没有它。我整天嚼口香糖，除了吃饭时的几分钟我会把它从嘴里拿出来，为了安全地放好，我把它贴在我的耳朵后面。老实告诉你们吧，如果一天里有一分钟不嚼口香糖，我简直就浑身不舒服，实在不舒服。我妈妈说，看见一个姑娘像我这样整天上下不停地动着上下颌，着实不像一位小姐，太难看了，但是我不同意这话。她算什么，竟然批评起我来了。如果你们问我，我可以告诉你们，她的上下颌几乎就像我的一样，整天上下不停地动，她每分钟都在对我大叫大嚷。’”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"'All right, Mother, keep your hair on!' Miss Beauregarde shouted. 'And now,' she went on, turning to the reporters again, 'it may interest you to know that this piece of gum I'm chewing right at this moment is one I've been working on for over three months solid. That's a record, that is. It's beaten the record held by my best friend, Miss Cornelia Prinzmetel. And was she furious! It's my most treasured possession now, this piece of gum is. At night-time, I just stick it on the end of the bedpost, and it's as good as ever in the mornings -a bit hard at first, maybe, but it soon softens up again after I've given it a few good chews. Before I started chewing for the world record, I used to change my piece of gum once a day. I used to do it in our lift on the way home from school. Why the lift? Because I liked sticking the gooey piece that I'd just finished with on to one of the control buttons. Then the next person who came along and pressed the button got my old gum on the end of his or her finger. Ha-ha! And what a racket they kicked up, some of them. You get the best results with women who have expensive gloves on. Oh yes, I'm thrilled to be going to Mr Wonka's factory. And I understand that afterwards he's going to give me enough gum to last me for the rest of my whole life. Whoopee! Hooray!'"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“‘好吧，妈妈，不要发脾气！’博雷加德小姐叫道。‘现在，’她转向记者们说，‘你们也许有兴趣知道，我正在嚼的这片口香糖，我已经嚼了整整三个月。这是一个记录，它打破了我最好的朋友康妮莉亚·普林茨梅特尔小姐所保持的记录。她气坏了！现在这片口香糖是我最珍惜的宝贝。夜里我把它贴在床柱上，到早晨又像原来一样好——起先也许硬一点儿，但用力嚼几下就变软了。在我准备嚼出世界记录以前，我总是每天换一片口香糖，也总是放学回家时在电梯里换。为什么在电梯里换呢？因为我喜欢把刚嚼完时黏糊糊的口香糖贴在电梯的按钮上。等到下一个人来乘电梯，一按按钮，我的旧口香糖就粘在他——男的或者女的——的手指上了。哈哈！有些人会大叫大嚷。碰到戴名贵手套的女人效果最好。噢，对的，要到旺卡先生的工厂去我很高兴。我知道他接下来还要送给我够吃一辈子的口香糖。好啊！万岁！’”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The Teavee household," said Mr Bucket, going on with his reading, "was crammed, like all the others, with excited visitors when our reporter arrived, but young Mike Teavee, the lucky winner, seemed extremely annoyed by the whole business. 'Can't you fools see I'm watching television?' he said angrily. 'I wish you wouldn't interrupt!'"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们的记者来到蒂维家时，”巴克特先生念下去，“他家跟其他几家一样挤满了兴奋的来访者，但幸运的奖券得主小迈克·蒂维似乎给整件事情惹烦了。‘你们这些傻瓜没有看到我正在看电视吗？’他生气地说，‘我希望你们别打扰我！’”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The nine-year-old boy was seated before an enormous television set, with his eyes glued to the screen, and he was watching a film in which one bunch of gangsters was shooting up another bunch of gangsters with machine guns. Mike Teavee himself had no less than eighteen toy pistols of various sizes hanging from belts around his body, and every now and again he would leap up into the air and fire off half a dozen rounds from one or another of these weapons."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Of course not," said Mr Bucket, smiling at the old lady in the bed. "Some do, of course. In fact, quite a lot of them do. But not all."</div>

<div class="line_en">"'Quiet!' he shouted, when someone tried to ask him a question. 'Didn't I tell you not to interrupt! This show's an absolute whiz-banger! It's terrific! I watch it every day. I watch all of them every day, even the rotten ones, where there's no shooting. I like the gangsters best. They're terrific, those gangsters! Especially when they start pumping each other full of lead, or flashing the old stilettos, or giving each other the one-two-three with their knuckledusters! Gosh, what wouldn't I give to be doing that myself! It's the life, I tell you! It's terrific!'"</div>
