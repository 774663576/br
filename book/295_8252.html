<div class="line_en">Theresa called to Garrett from the shower, asking him to bring her a towel. Garrett covered the mouthpiece and told her he'd be right there. When he returned his attention to the phone, he heard his father inhale sharply.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Sure." Garrett sighed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Theresa emerged from the bedroom a few minutes later, looking rested and fresh. Smelling coffee brewing, she went to the kitchen for a cup. After putting a piece of bread in the toaster, Garrett walked to her side.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Good morning again to you, too."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Does she make you happy?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"So did I," he said. Fishing a coffee cup out of the cupboard for Theresa, he asked over his shoulder, "Do you want to do something today? I called the shop and told them I wasn't coming in."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's about damn time," he said again with a laugh before hanging up. Garrett stared at the phone as he replaced it in its cradle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Of course I do." She turned and faced him with a smile. "I had a wonderful night."</div>

<div class="line_en">"And do what?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, I can think of a couple of things," she said, putting her arms around him. "That is, if you don't have a problem with that."</div>

<div class="line_en">For the next four days, Theresa and Garrett were inseparable. Garrett ceded control of the shop to Ian, even allowing him to teach the dive classes on Saturday, something he'd never done before. Twice, Garrett and Theresa went sailing; on the second night they stayed out all night on the ocean, lying together in the cabin, rocked by the gentle swells of the Atlantic. Later that evening she asked him to tell her more adventure stories about early sailors, and she stroked his hair as the sound of his voice reverberated against the interior of the hull.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What she didn't know was that after she'd fallen asleep, Garrett left her side as he had their first night together and paced the deck alone. He thought about Theresa sleeping inside and the fact that she would be leaving soon, and with that thought came another memory from years before.</div>

<div class="line_en">She stood beside the front door, her suitcase beside her, frustrated with his comment. "C'mon, Garrett, we've already talked about this. I'm only going to be gone for a few days."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Garrett took an involuntary step backward, as if she'd struck him. "I didn't say we were. I'm just not sure whether you should go when you're feeling this way."</div>

<div class="line_en">When the memory faded, Garrett walked back inside the cabin and saw Theresa lying under the sheet. Quietly he slipped in beside her and held her tightly against him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The following day was spent at the beach, sitting near the pier where they'd first had lunch. When Theresa got sunburned by the early morning rays, Garrett walked to one of the many shops right off the beach and brought back some lotion. He applied it to her back, rubbing it into her skin, as gently as if she were a child, and even though she didn't want to believe it, deep down she could feel that there were moments when his mind was drifting somewhere else. But then, just as suddenly, the moments would pass and she would wonder whether she'd been mistaken.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They had lunch at Hank's again, holding hands and staring at each other from across the table. They talked quietly, oblivious to the throngs around them, neither one of them noticing when the check was brought to the table and the lunch crowd emptied out. Theresa watched him carefully, wondering if Garrett had been as intuitive with Catherine as he seemed to be with her. It was as if he could almost read her mind whenever they were together-if she wanted him to hold her hand, he reached for it before she said anything. If she just wanted to talk for a while without interruption, he listened quietly. If she wanted to know how he was feeling about her at any particular moment, the way he looked at her made it all clear. No one-not even David-had ever understood her as well as Garrett seemed to, yet how long had she known him? A few days? How, she wondered, could that be? Late at night, she thought about the answer as he lay sleeping by her side, and the answer always came back to the bottles she had originally found. The more she had come to know Garrett, the more she believed that she was destined to find his messages to Catherine, as if there were some great force that had directed them to her, with the intention of bringing them together.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Will I ever see you again?" she asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Of course I do." As he said it, he sat up in the bed, pulling slightly away from her. After a moment she sat up and turned on the bedside lamp.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On Saturday evening Garrett cooked another dinner for her, which they ate on the back deck under the stars. After making love, they lay in his bed, holding each other. Both of them knew that she had to return to Boston the following day. It was a subject they had both avoided talking about until now.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He paused for a long moment. "Do you really think it's possible if we don't see each other very much? When would I get to hold you? When would I be able to see your face? If we only see each other once in a while, we won't be able to do the things that we need to… to continue feeling the way we do. Every time we saw each other, we'd know it's only for a couple of days. There wouldn't be time for anything to grow."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I just don't want it to end," he said, looking down. "I don't want us to end, I don't want this week to end. I mean, you come into my life and turn it upside-down, and now you're leaving."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His words stung, partly from the truth and partly because he seemed to want to simply end it here and now. When he finally turned to her, a regretful smile on his face, she didn't know what to say. She released his hand, confused.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He shook his head. "No-I don't want to forget it. I can't forget it. I don't know… I just want to see you more than it sounds like we'll be able to."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Of course it does. It matters more than you think." When he reached out to take her hand, she flinched and he saw how much he had hurt her. He spoke gently, trying to control his own emotions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I do care. I care so much that it scares me. I haven't felt like this in so long, it's almost like I've forgotten how important another person could be to me. I don't think I could just let you go and forget you, and I don't want to. And I definitely don't want us to end right now." For a moment there was only the soft, even sound of his breathing. Finally he whispered, "I promise to do everything I can to see you. And we'll try to make it work."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Theresa, I'm sorry for putting you-putting us-through this on our last night. I didn't mean for it to happen. Believe me, you weren't a fling for me. God-you were anything but that. I told you I really care about you, and I mean that."</div>

<div class="line_en">They made love first thing in the morning and held each other until the sun had risen high enough to let them know it was time for Theresa to get ready. Even though she hadn't spent much time at all at the hotel and had brought her suitcase over to Garrett's house, she hadn't checked out, just in case Kevin or Deanna called.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The tenderness in his voice made her tears begin to fall. He went on, almost too quietly for her to hear. "Theresa, I think I'm in love with you."</div>

<div class="line_en">I think I'm in love with you, she heard again. I think…</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They showered together, and after dressing, Garrett made Theresa breakfast while she finished packing her things. Zipping her suitcase, Theresa heard the sound of sizzling in the kitchen as the smell of bacon wafted through the house. After drying her hair and putting on some makeup, she walked into the kitchen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Garrett was sitting at the table, drinking coffee. He winked at her when she entered. On the counter he'd left a cup by the coffeemaker, and she poured herself some. Breakfast was already on the table-scrambled eggs, bacon, and toast. Theresa sat in the chair closest to him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Not wanting to respond, she simply whispered: "Just hold me, okay? Let's not talk anymore."</div>

<div class="line_en">Finally she pulled back. Their time in the sun this week had left her tanned. In her jeans shorts and clean white shirt, she looked like a carefree teenager. For a moment she stared down at the small flower designs stitched into her sandals. Her suitcase and purse stood waiting next to the bedroom door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She got up from her chair and went to him, sitting in his lap. She wrapped her arms around him and buried her face in his neck. He held her tightly in return, running his hands through her hair.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She nodded, her lips pursed. "No, I'll be rushing just to catch my flight as it is, and besides, you'd have to follow me in your truck. We can say good-bye just as easily here."</div>

<div class="line_en">He laughed again, and she gave him a watery smile. Then she stood and wiped the wetness from her cheeks. Garrett moved to her suitcase and picked it up, and they both left the house. Outside, the sun was already climbing in the sky, and it was warming up quickly. Theresa retrieved the sunglasses she kept in the side pocket of her purse, holding them in her hand as they walked to her rental car.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She unlocked the trunk, and he placed her things inside. Then, taking her in his arms, he kissed her once gently and released her. After opening her car door, he helped her inside and she put the key in the ignition.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He stepped back from the door and closed it. She rolled down the window and put her hand out. Garrett took it in his for just a moment. Then she shifted the car into reverse.</div>

<div class="line_en">Despite the traffic, Theresa made it to the hotel quickly and checked out. There were three messages from Deanna, each seemingly more desperate than the last. "What's going on down there? How did your date go?" read the first one; "Why didn't you call? I'm waiting to hear all about it," read the second; and the third said simply, "You're killing me! Call me with the details-please!" There was also one message from Kevin-she'd called him a couple of times from Garrett's house-and it seemed to be at least a couple of days old. She returned the rental car and reached the airport with less than a half hour to spare. Luckily the line to check her bags was short, and she made it to the gate just as they were boarding. After handing her ticket to the stewardess, she boarded the plane and took her seat. The flight to Charlotte was only partly full, and the seat next to her was vacant.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She pulled her hand in, smiling at him, and slowly started forward. Garrett watched her as she waved one last time before driving off, wondering how on earth he'd get through the next two weeks.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Theresa closed her eyes, thinking back on the amazing events of the past week. Not only had she found Garrett, but she had come to know him better than she would ever have imagined possible. He had stirred deep feelings in her, feelings she had long thought were buried.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Idly she ran through their conversation of last night. His fears of letting go of the past, his feelings about not seeing her as much as he wanted to. These things she understood completely. But…</div>

<div class="line_en">She frowned. Why did he add the word "think"? Either he was in love or he wasn't… wasn't he? Had he said it to appease her? Or had he said it for another reason?</div>

<div class="line_en">She shut her eyes tiredly, suddenly unwilling to confront her warring emotions. One thing was for sure, though-she wasn't ever going to tell him that she loved him until she was certain he could put Catherine behind him. That night, in Garrett's dreams, a violent storm was well under way. Rain pelted hard against the side of the house, and Garrett ran frantically from one room to the next. It was the house he lived in now, and though he knew exactly where he was going, the blinding rain coming in the open windows made it difficult to see. Knowing he had to close them, he rushed to the bedroom and found himself entangled in the curtains as they blew inward. Fighting them off, he reached the window just as the lights went off.</div>

<div class="line_en">But what about her? Did she love Garrett?</div>

<div class="line_en">The room went black. Above the storm, he could hear the sound of a distant siren, warning of a hurricane. Lightning illuminated the sky as he struggled with the window.
