<div class="line_en">"Aunt March went today, for which, oh, be joyful!" said Jo. "I was mortally afraid she'd ask me to go with her. If she had, I should have felt as if I ought to do it, but Plumfield is about as gay as a churchyard, you know, and I'd rather be excused. We had a flurry getting the old lady off, and I had a fright every time she spoke to me, for I was in such a hurry to be through that I was uncommonly helpful and sweet, and feared she'd find it impossible to part from me. I quaked till she was fairly in the carriage, and had a final fright, for as it drove of, she popped out her head, saying, 'Josyphine, won't you --?' I didn't hear any more, for I basely turned and fled. I did actually run, and whisked round the corner where I felt safe."</div>

<div class="line_en">"May we, Mother?" asked Meg, turning to Mrs. March, who sat sewing in what they called 'Marmee's corner'.</div>

<div class="line_en">They all drank it merrily, and began the experiment by lounging for the rest of the day. Next morning, Meg did not appear till ten o'clock. Her solitary breakfast did not taste good, and the room seemed lonely and untidy, for Jo had not filled the vases, Beth had not dusted, and Amy's books lay scattered about. Nothing was neat and pleasant but 'Marmee's corner', which looked as usual. And there Meg sat, to 'rest and read', which meant to yawn and imagine what pretty summer dresses she would get with her salary. Jo spent the morning on the river with Laurie and the afternoon reading and crying over The Wide, Wide World, up in the apple tree. Beth began by rummaging everything out of the big closet where her family resided, but getting tired before half done, she left her establishment topsy-turvy and went to her music, rejoicing that she had no dishes to wash. Amy arranged her bower, put on her best white frock, smoothed her curls, and sat down to draw under the honeysuckle, hoping someone would see and inquire who the young artist was. As no one appeared but an inquisitive daddy-longlegs, who examined her work with interest, she went to walk, got caught in a shower, and came home dripping.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大家快乐地一饮而尽，于是试验开始，那天的剩余时间便被懒洋洋地打发过去了。第二天早上，梅格直到十点钟才露面。她独个儿吃早餐，却食之无味；由于乔没有在花瓶里插上花，贝思也没有打扫，艾美又把书丢得满地都是，房间显得空空落落，十分零乱，只有‘妈咪角’仍然跟平常一样井井有条，令人愉快。梅格便坐在那里，‘休息读书’，也就是说一面打呵欠一面胡思乱想，盘算着用自己的薪水买什么式样的漂亮夏装。乔在河边和劳里玩了一个早上，下午爬到苹果树上读《大世界》读得泪流满面。贝思从洋娃娃家族居住的大衣柜里头把东西全部翻出来整理，未及一半便倦了，于是把她的大家族横七竖八地躲在一边去弹钢琴，暗暗庆幸自己不用洗碗碟。艾美把花荫收拾一番，穿上漂亮的白色上衣，把鬈发梳理一遍，坐在忍冬花下画画，希望有人看到她，询问这位年轻的艺术家是谁。可惜只来了一只好事的长脚蜘蛛，饶有兴趣地把她的作品审视一番，她只好去散步，却遭大雨淋了一顿，回家时湿得像个落汤鸡。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At teatime they compared notes, and all agreed that it had been a delightful, though unusually long day. Meg, who went shopping in the afternoon and got a 'sweet blue muslin', had discovered, after she had cut the breadths off, that it wouldn't wash, which mishap made her slightly cross. Jo had burned the skin off her nose boating, and got a raging headache by reading too long. Beth was worried by the confusion of her closet and the difficulty of learning three or four songs at once, and Amy deeply regretted the damage done her frock, for Katy Brown's party was to be the next day and now like Flora McFlimsey, she had 'nothing to wear'. But these were mere trifles, and they assured their mother that the experiment was working finely. She smiled, said nothing, and with Hannah's help did their neglected work, keeping home pleasant and the domestic machinery running smoothly. It was astonishing what a peculiar and uncomfortable state of things was produced by the 'resting and reveling' process. The days kept getting longer and longer, the weather was unusually variable and so were tempers; an unsettled feeling possessed everyone, and Satan found plenty of mischief for the idle hands to do. As the height of luxury, Meg put out some of her sewing, and then found time hang so heavily, that she fell to snipping and spoiling her clothes in her attempts to furbish them up a la Moffat. Jo read till her eyes gave out and she was sick of books, got so fidgety that even good-natured Laurie had a quarrel with her, and so reduced in spirits that she desperately wished she had gone with Aunt March. Beth got on pretty well, for she was constantly forgetting that it was to be all play and no work, and fell back into her old ways now and then. But something in the air affected her, and more than once her tranquility was much disturbed, so much so that on one occasion she actually shook poor dear Joanna and told her she was 'a fright'. Amy fared worst of all, for her resources were small, and when her sisters left her to amuse herself, she soon found that accomplished and important little self a great burden. She didn't like dolls, fairy tales were childish, and one couldn't draw all the time. Tea parties didn't amount to much, neither did picnics, unless very well conducted. "If one could have a fine house, full of nice girls, or go traveling, the summer would be delightful, but to stay at home with three selfish sisters and a grown-up boy was enough to try the patience of a Boaz," complained Miss Malaprop, after several days devoted to pleasure, fretting, and ennui.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到了喝茶的时候，她们互相交流心得，一致认为这天过得相当愉快，只是日子似乎格外长。梅格下午上街买了一幅‘漂亮的蓝薄纱’，把幅面裁开后才发现这种布不经洗，这一小小的不幸令她脾气有点暴躁。乔划船时晒脱了鼻子上的皮，长时间看书又害得她脑袋生疼。贝思因为衣柜混乱不堪而忧心忡忡，一下子学三四首歌又力不从心。艾美淋湿了上衣，后悔不迭，第二天就是凯蒂·布朗的晚会，现在，她就像弗洛拉·麦克弗里姆西一样，‘没有衣服穿’。不过，这些都只是小事一桩，她们告诉母亲进展顺利。母亲笑笑，不做声，和罕娜一起把姐妹们丢下的工作接过来，把家操持得整齐舒适，使家庭机构顺利运作。这种‘休息和享乐’产生的结果出人意料：大家都有一种奇怪的、极不自在的感觉。日子变得越来越长，天气也跟她们的脾气一样变化无常，大家心里全都无头无绪，空空落落。而魔鬼撒旦可不会让你两手白闲着，他总会找出一些事来让你做。作为最高享受，梅格把一些针线活拿出去让人做，但接着便发现时间十分沉闷，熬不住又操起裁剪活，结果在莫法特家刷新衣服时因为使劲太大而把自己的衣服弄坏了。乔书不离手，一直读得两眼昏花，见书生厌，脾气也变得异常烦躁，连性子极好的劳里也跟她吵了一架，她于是伤心落泪，只恨未能早跟了马奇婶婶去。贝思倒过得相当安稳，因为她常常忘记了这是光玩不工作时间，不时重新操起旧活；但大家的情绪感染了她，性子一向温柔平和的她也变得有几分烦躁不安——一次甚至把可怜的宠儿乔安娜摇了几下，骂她是个‘怪物’。最难受的要数艾美，她的娱乐圈子窄，三位姐姐把她丢下，让她自己玩并自己照顾自己，她很快发现自己这个多才多艺、举足轻重的小人儿其实是个大包袱。她不喜欢洋娃娃，童话故事又太幼稚，而人也总不能一天到晚光画画；茶会没什么意思，野餐也不过如此，除非组织得极好。”如果能有一栋漂亮的房子，里头住满了善解人意的姑娘，或者外出旅游，这夏天才会过得开心。但跟三个自私的姐姐和一个大男孩呆在家里，（圣）神人也会发火，”我们的错词小姐心里抱怨道。这几天她充分体验了欢乐、烦恼，继而厌倦无聊的况味。">查看中文翻译</div>

It's a very queer thing for her to do, she doesn't act a bit like herself. But she says it has been a hard week for her, so we mustn't grumble but take care of ourselves."</div>

<div class="line_en">No one would own that they were tired of the experiment, but by Friday night each acknowledged to herself that she was glad the week was nearly done. Hoping to impress the lesson more deeply, Mrs. March, who had a good deal of humor, resolved to finish off the trial in an appropriate manner, so she gave Hannah a holiday and let the girls enjoy the full effect of the play system.</div>

<div class="line_en">In fact it was an immense relief to them all to have a little work, and they took hold with a will, but soon realized the truth of Hannah's saying, "Housekeeping ain't no joke." There was plenty of food in the larder, and while Beth and Amy set the table, Meg and Jo got breakfast, wondering as they did why servants ever talked about hard work.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="事实上，此时此刻，做一点工作对她们来说是一种很好的放松。她们决心把活干好，但“做家务可不是闹儿戏”，她们很快便会认识到罕娜这话的实际意义了。食品柜里有很多存货，贝思和艾美摆桌子，梅格和乔做早餐，一面做一面还奇怪为什么佣人说家务难做。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Having rekindled the fire, she thought she would go to market while the water heated. The walk revived her spirits, and flattering herself that she had made good bargains, she trudged home again, after buying a very young lobster, some very old asparagus, and two boxes of acid strawberries. By the time she got cleared up, the dinner arrived and the stove was red-hot. Hannah had left a pan of bread to rise, Meg had worked it up early, set it on the hearth for a second rising, and forgotten it. Meg was entertaining Sallie Gardiner in the parlor, when the door flew open and a floury, crocky, flushed, and disheveled figure appeared, demanding tartly…</div>

Mrs. March went out, after peeping here and there to see how matters went, also saying a word of comfort to Beth, who sat making a winding sheet, while the dear departed lay in state in the domino box. A strange sense of helplessness fell upon the girls as the gray bonnet vanished round the corner, and despair seized them when a few minutes later Miss Crocker appeared, and said she'd come to dinner.

<div class="line_en">Language cannot describe the anxieties, experiences, and exertions which Jo underwent that morning, and the dinner she served up became a standing joke. Fearing to ask any more advice, she did her best alone, and discovered that something more than energy and good will is necessary to make a cook. She boiled the asparagus for an hour and was grieved to find the heads cooked off and the stalks harder than ever. The bread burned black; for the salad dressing so aggravated her that she could not make it fit to eat. The lobster was a scarlet mystery to her, but she hammered and poked till it was unshelled and its meager proportions concealed in a grove of lettuce leaves. The potatoes had to be hurried, not to keep the asparagus waiting, and were not done at the last. The blanc mange was lumpy, and the strawberries not as ripe as they looked, having been skilfully 'deaconed'.</div>

Jo's one strong point was the fruit, for she had sugared it well, and had a pitcher of rich cream to eat with it. Her hot cheeks cooled a trifle, and she drew a long breath as the pretty glass plates went round, and everyone looked graciously at the little rosy islands floating in a sea of cream. Miss Crocker tasted first, made a wry face, and drank some water hastily. Jo, who refused, thinking there might not be enough, for they dwindled sadly after the picking over, glanced at Laurie, but he was eating away manfully, though there was a slight pucker about his mouth and he kept his eye fixed on his plate. Amy, who was fond of delicate fare, took a heaping spoonful, choked, hid her face in her napkin, and left the table precipitately.</div>

She turned scarlet and was on the verge of crying, when she met Laurie's eyes, which would look merry in spite of his heroic efforts. The comical side of the affair suddenly struck her, and she laughed till the tears ran down her cheeks.
