<div class="line_en">A cold rain was falling, turning the walls and ramparts of the Red Keep dark as blood. The queen held the king's hand and led him firmly across the muddy yard to where her litter waited with its escort. "Uncle Jaime said I could ride my horse and throw pennies to the smallfolk," the boy objected.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Do you want to catch a chill?" She would not risk it; Tommen had never been as robust as Joffrey. "Your grandfather would want you to look a proper king at his wake. We will not appear at the Great Sept wet and bedraggled." Bad enough I must wear mourning again. Black had never been a happy color on her. With her fair skin, it made her look half a corpse herself. Cersei had risen an hour before dawn to bathe and fix her hair, and she did not intend to let the rain destroy her efforts.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tommen did as he was bid. His meekness troubled her. A king had to be strong. Joffrey would have argued. He was never easy to cow. "Don't slump so," she told Tommen. "Sit like a king. Put your shoulders back and straighten your crown. Do you want it to tumble off your head in front of all your lords?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="托曼听话照办，然而他的温顺让母亲不安。王者无畏，乔佛里会与我争执，决不会乖乖就范。“坐要有坐相！”她嘱咐托曼，“要有国王的样子。肩膀挺起来，王冠戴好啰——你这样随随便便，待会儿在诸侯们面前掉下去怎么办？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, Mother." The boy sat straight and reached up to fix the crown. Joff's crown was too big for him. Tommen had always inclined to plumpness, but his face seemed thinner now. Is he eating well? She must remember to ask the steward. She could not risk Tommen growing ill, not with Myrcella in the hands of the Dornishmen. He will grow into Joff's crown in time. Until he did, a smaller one might be needed, one that did not threaten to swallow his head. She would take it up with the goldsmiths.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不会让它掉下去的，母亲。”男孩坐直身子，伸手整理王冠。小乔的王冠对他而言太大了，这个胖胖的托曼…等等，他的脸似乎变瘦了。最近，儿子的饮食正常吗？我得记住盘问总管。眼下弥赛菈在多恩人手里，可不能让托曼出半点差错。总有一天，他会长大，适合戴上小乔留下的冠冕。目前还是做个小一号的为好，以免压疼他的脑袋。太后决定马上去找金匠。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At the Great Sept of Baelor, that magnificence in marble atop Visenya's Hill, the little knot of mourners were outnumbered by the gold cloaks that Ser Addam Marbrand had drawn up across the plaza. More will turn out later, the queen told herself as Ser Meryn Trant helped her from the litter. Only the highborn and their retinues were to be admitted to the morning service; there would be another in the afternoon for the commons, and the evening prayers were open to all. Cersei would need to return for that, so that the smallfolk might see her mourn. The mob must have its show. It was a nuisance. She had offices to fill, a war to win, a realm to rule. Her father would have understood that.</div>

<div class="line_en">The old man's spotted hand looked like a chicken claw as it poked from a sleeve encrusted with golden scrollwork and small crystals. Cersei knelt on the wet marble and kissed his fingers, and bid Tommen to do the same. What does he know of me? How much did the dwarf tell him? The High Septon smiled as he escorted her into the sept. But was it a threatening smile full of unspoken knowledge, or just some vacuous twitch of an old man's wrinkled lips? The queen could not be certain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="总主教斑斑点点的手掌从装饰着黄金花纹和小水晶球的长袖中伸出来，活像一只鸡爪。瑟曦跪在潮湿的大理石上，亲吻他的指头，并让托曼也照办。他了解我多少？侏儒跟他说了些什么？总主教微笑着护送她进入圣堂，笑容中充满暗示，充满威胁，或许那不过是褶皱的嘴唇在无谓地抽搐？太后吃不准。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The High Septon met them at the top of the steps. A bent old man with a wispy grey beard, he was so stooped by the weight of his ornate embroidered robes that his eyes were on a level with the queen's breasts… though his crown, an airy confection of cut crystal and spun gold, added a good foot and a half to his height.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="总主教在阶梯顶上等待他们，他是个老人，留着稀疏的灰胡须，背驼得如此厉害，好似承受不住浑身华丽绣袍的重量，眼睛直低到对齐太后的胸口…好在那顶用无瑕的水晶和金丝铸成的优雅冠冕，为他增加了一尺半高度。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Lord Tywin had given him that crown to replace the one that was lost when the mob killed the previous High Septon. They had pulled the fat fool from his litter and torn him apart, the day Myrcella sailed for Dorne. That one was a great glutton, and biddable. This one… This High Septon was of Tyrion's making, Cersei recalled suddenly. It was a disquieting thought.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这顶冠冕正是拜泰温公爵所赐，以代替动乱中暴民杀害前任总主教时所丢失的那顶。当日，他们把那老笨蛋从轿子里拖出来撕成了碎片，那也是弥赛菈离我而去、远赴多恩的日子。那家伙虽然又笨又贪吃，至少可以收买，眼前这位…这是提利昂任命的，瑟曦想着想着，心生不悦。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At least I will not be expected to don mourning for Tyrion. I shall dress in crimson silk and cloth-of-gold for that, and wear rubies in my hair. The man who brought her the dwarf's head would be raised to lordship, she had proclaimed, no matter how mean and low his birth or station. Ravens were carrying her promise to every part of the Seven Kingdoms, and soon enough word would cross the narrow sea to the Nine Free Cities and the lands beyond. Let the Imp run to the ends of the earth, he will not escape me.</div>

<div class="line_en">They made their way through the Hall of Lamps beneath colored globes of leaded glass, Tommen's hand in hers. Trant and Kettleblack flanked them, water dripping from their wet cloaks to puddle on the floor. The High Septon walked slowly, leaning on a weirwood staff topped by a crystal orb. Seven of the Most Devout attended him, shimmering in cloth-of-silver. Tommen wore cloth-of-gold beneath his sable mantle, the queen an old gown of black velvet lined with ermine. There'd been no time to have a new one made, and she could not wear the same dress she had worn for Joffrey, nor the one she'd buried Robert in.</div>

<div class="line_en">Under the Great Sept's lofty dome of glass and gold and crystal, Lord Tywin Lannister's body rested upon a stepped marble bier. At its head Jaime stood at vigil, his one good hand curled about the hilt of a tall golden greatsword whose point rested on the floor. The hooded cloak he wore was as white as freshly fallen snow, and the scales of his long hauberk were mother-of-pearl chased with gold. Lord Tywin would have wanted him in Lannister gold and crimson, she thought. It always angered him to see Jaime all in white. Her brother was growing his beard again as well. The stubble covered his jaw and cheeks, and gave his face a rough, uncouth look. He might at least have waited till Father's bones were interred beneath the Rock.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在大殿由水晶、玻璃和黄金砌成的巍峨穹顶下，泰温·兰尼斯特公爵的身躯静躺在平台上的大理石棺中。詹姆在棺材前为父亲守灵，用完好的那只手握着一只极长的黄金巨剑，剑尖抵住地面，他身披的兜帽斗篷洁白犹如新雪，斗篷下的长锁甲则装饰有珍珠母与黄金。泰温大人宁愿他身穿兰尼斯特的红金服装，她明白，每每看到詹姆身披白袍的样子父亲就会发火。弟弟的胡子又长出来了，短短的胡碴掩盖了下巴与脸颊，使他看起来有些沧桑、粗鲁。也许，在父亲安息于凯岩城的地下之前，他都不会刮吧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The royal procession passed through the inner doors into the cavernous heart of the Great Sept, and down a wide aisle, one of seven that met beneath the dome. To right and left, highborn mourners sank to their knees as the king and queen went by. Many of her father's bannermen were here, and knights who had fought beside Lord Tywin in half a hundred battles. The sight of them made her feel more confident. I am not without friends.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="王家队伍通过几重内门，来到圣堂中心的大殿，顺着穹顶之下七条宽阔走道之一走下去，七条走道在中央交会。周围的贵族在国王和太后身边纷纷跪下，其中许多是父亲的旧部与封臣，有的骑士跟随泰温公爵征战了大小几十场战斗。看着他们，她觉得心里踏实多了。我不是没有朋友的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The silent sisters had armored Lord Tywin as if to fight some final battle. He wore his finest plate, heavy steel enameled a deep, dark crimson, with gold inlay on his gauntlets, greaves, and breastplate. His rondels were golden sunbursts; a golden lioness crouched upon each shoulder; a maned lion crested the greathelm beside his head. Upon his chest lay a longsword in a gilded scabbard studded with rubies, his hands folded about its hilt in gloves of gilded mail. Even in death his face is noble, she thought, although the mouth… The corners of her father's lips curved upward ever so slightly, giving him a look of vague bemusement. That should not be. She blamed Pycelle; he should have told the silent sisters that Lord Tywin Lannister never smiled. The man is as useless as nipples on a breastplate. That half smile made Lord Tywin seem less fearful, somehow. That, and the fact that his eyes were closed. Her father's eyes had always been unsettling; pale green, almost luminous, flecked with gold. His eyes could see inside you, could see how weak and worthless and ugly you were down deep. When he looked at you, you knew.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="静默姐妹把泰温大人打扮得似乎正要去参战。他穿着自己最好的板甲，厚重的钢板上了暗红色瓷釉，胸甲、护胫和手套均有繁复的黄金涡形装饰，护手圆盘则是黄金日芒。一对黄金母狮子趴在肩头，她们的配偶昂首立于巨盔顶上。公爵大人的胸前放了一把镀金剑鞘、红宝石装点的巨剑，公爵用镀金锁甲手套牢牢地将其握住。他死后的遗容都是如此尊贵，她心想，唯有那张嘴巴…父亲的嘴角微微上扬，似乎在茫然地微笑。简直荒唐。是派席尔的错，他应该告诉静默姐妹：泰温·兰尼斯特公爵从来不笑。老糊涂蛋，跟胸甲上的乳头一样没用。这淡淡的笑，外加紧闭的眼睛，使得泰温大人的模样不那么可怕了——然而父亲的眼神本是他的灵魂所系：那纯粹的绿，闪闪发亮，其中有金色的瞳仁。那双眼睛可以看穿你，看穿你灵魂中的虚弱、无能与丑陋。他可以夺人心魄。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Cersei led the king up three short steps, to kneel beside the body. Tommen's eyes were filled with tears. "Weep quietly," she told him, leaning close. "You are a king, not a squalling child. Your lords are watching you." The boy swiped the tears away with the back of his hand. He had her eyes, emerald green, as large and bright as Jaime's eyes had been when he was Tommen's age. Her brother had been such a pretty boy… but fierce as well, as fierce as Joffrey, a true lion cub. The queen put her arm around Tommen and kissed his golden curls. He will need me to teach him how to rule and keep him safe from his enemies. Some of them stood around them even now, pretending to be friends.</div>

<div class="line_en">Unbidden, a memory came to her, of the feast King Aerys had thrown when Cersei first came to court, a girl as green as summer grass. Old Merryweather had been nattering about raising the duty on wine when Lord Rykker said, "If we need gold, His Grace should sit Lord Tywin on his chamber pot." Aerys and his lickspittles laughed loudly, whilst Father stared at Rykker over his wine cup. Long after the merriment had died that gaze had lingered. Rykker turned away, turned back, met Father's eyes, then ignored them, drank a tankard of ale, and stalked off red-faced, defeated by a pair of unflinching eyes.</div>

The seven septons in the silver robes stood behind the bier, beseeching the Father Above to judge Lord Tywin justly. When they were done, seventy-seven septas gathered before the altar of the Mother and began to sing to her for mercy. Tommen was fidgeting by then, and even the queen's knees had begun to ache.

Queen Margaery, she reminded herself; Joff's widow and Tommen's wife-tobe. Margaery looked very like her brother, the Knight of Flowers. The queen wondered if they had other things in common. Our little rose has a good many ladies waiting attendance on her, night and day. They were with her now, almost a dozen of them. Cersei studied their faces, wondering.

<div class="line_en">Back out in the Hall of Lamps, the mourners buzzed about them thick as flies, eager to shower her with useless condolences. The Redwyne twins both kissed her hand, their father her cheeks. Hallyne the Pyromancer promised her that a flaming hand would burn in the sky above the city on the day her father's bones went west. Between coughs, Lord Gyles told her that he had hired a master stonecarver to make a statue of Lord Tywin, to stand eternal vigil beside the Lion Gate.

Most of the mourners had the decency to pretend that nothing was amiss, but Cersei saw two of Lady Margaery's cousins wrinkling their little Tyrell noses. As she and Tommen were walking back down the aisle the queen thought she heard someone mutter "privy" and chortle, but when she turned her head to see who had spoken a sea of solemn faces gazed at her blankly. They would never have dared make japes about him when he was still alive. He would have turned their bowels to water with a look.</div>

"My lady mother sends her regrets, Your Grace," Falyse burbled at her. "Lollys has been taken to bed with the child and she felt the need to stay with her.

Lancel was a weak reed, and she liked his newfound piety not at all; he had been much more amusing when he was trying to be Jaime. What has this mewling fool told the High Septon? And what will he tell his little Frey when they lie together in the dark? If he confessed to bedding Cersei, well, she could weather that. Men were always lying about women; she would put it down as the braggadocio of a callow boy smitten by her beauty.

<div class="line_en">"Better that than suffer another Tyrell on the council." His reproach annoyed her. "Rosby will make an adequate master of coin. You've seen that litter of his, with its carvings and silk draperies. His horses are better dressed than most knights. A man that rich should have no problem finding gold. As for Handship… who better to finish my father's work than the brother who shared all his counsels?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“总比让提利尔混进御前会议好得多！”他的责备让她不耐烦。“罗斯比会是个不错的财政大臣，看看他的坐轿，看看那上面的雕刻装饰与丝绸织锦你就知道了。他的马比大多数骑士的马打扮得更华丽。一个如此富裕的人想必精通生财之道。至于御前首相嘛…谁能比我父亲的弟弟，那个从来与我父亲亲密无间，并无私奉献着的弟弟更有资格接过他的担子呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>

"I have a wife I have not seen in two years, a dead son to mourn, another son about to marry and assume a lordship. Castle Darry must be made strong again, its lands protected, its burned fields plowed and planted anew. Lancel needs my help."</div>

<div class="line_en">"I hold no lands, that is true. But I have certain incomes, and chests of coin set aside.

<div class="line_en">"Mathis Rowan is sensible, prudent, well liked," her uncle went on, oblivious. "Randyll Tarly is the finest soldier in the realm. A poor Hand for peacetime, but with Tywin dead there's no better man to finish this war. Lord Tyrell cannot take offense if you choose one of his own bannermen as Hand. Both Tarly and Rowan are able men… and loyal. Name either one, and you make him yours. You strengthen yourself and weaken Highgarden, yet Mace will likely thank you for it." He gave a shrug. "That is my counsel, take it or no. You may make Moon Boy your Hand for all I care. My brother is dead, woman. I am going to take him home."</div>
