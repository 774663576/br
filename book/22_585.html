<div class="line_en">I suppose that even then -- or rather, especially then, when our compact is so new, so unproved, its threads still slender and weak -- I suppose that even then I might draw back, unloose myself from the tugging of his ambition. I believe I wake thinking I will; for the room -- the room in which, in whispers, at the hush of midnight, he took my hand, unfolded his dangerous plan, like a man putting back the rustling wrappers about a poison -- the room reassembles itself in the chill half-hour of dawn into all its rigid familiar lines. I lie and watch it. I know every curve and angle. I know them, too well. I remember weeping, as a girl of eleven, at the strangeness of Briar -- at the silence, the stillness, the turning passages and cluttered walls. I supposed then that those things would be strange to me for ever, I felt their strangeness make me strange -- make me a thing of points and hooks, a burr, a splinter in the gullet of the house. But Briar crept on me. Briar absorbed me. Now I feel the simple weight of the woollen cloak with which I have covered myself and think, I shall never escape! I am not meant to escape! Briar will never let me!</div>

<div class="line_en">But, I am wrong. Richard Rivers has come into Briar like a spore of yeast into dough, changing it utterly. When I go, at eight o'clock, to the library, I am sent away: he is there with my uncle, looking over the prints. They pass three hours together. And when, in the afternoon, I am summoned downstairs to make my farewells to the gentlemen, it is only Mr Hawtrey and Mr Huss that I must give my hand to. I find them in the hall, fastening their greatcoats, drawing on their gloves, while my uncle leans upon his cane and Richard stands, a little way off, his hands in his pockets, looking on. He sees me first. He meets my gaze, but makes no gesture. Then the others hear my step and lift their heads to watch me. Mr Hawtrey smiles.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，我错了，理查德·瑞富斯来到布莱尔，象一粒酵母粉落进面团里，彻底改变了布莱尔。次日八时，我去书房，随即就被打发走了：他跟我舅舅在那儿研究画。他们在一起待了三个小时。然后到中午，我被叫到楼下，跟绅士们告别，只有霍粹先生和哈斯先生要走。我在大厅见到他们，他们正忙着穿戴，我舅舅斜支在手杖上，理查德站在一旁，手揣在口袋里。是他先看到我。他与我对视一眼，但未做任何示意。这时其他人听到脚步声，都扭过头来注视着我。霍粹先生微笑着。">查看中文翻译</div>

They eat clay, you know, to whiten their complexions? Pure clay." He shakes his head. "I do think the fashion for pallor a most unhealthy one. As for you, Miss Lilly, I am struck again -- as I always am, when I must leave you! -- by the unfairness of your uncle keeping you here in such a miserable, mushroom-like way."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，二者皆是。”霍粹先生；“不过我是指那个雕像。李小姐跟雕像一样白皙，你看是不是？”他拉起我的手。“我家里的姑娘们该多么嫉妒你啊！她们吃黏土，你知道吗？为了美白肌肤，那是黏土啊。”他摇头叹息。“我觉得追求惨白的面色是一种最不健康的风气。至于你，李小姐，正如每次要离开你时我所感到的，我再次为你舅舅给予你的不公正待遇而感到愤慨，他让你待在这个不见天日的地方，象养蘑菇一样待你。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“不知道。”理查德说道。然后他转向我，低声加了一句：“不，李小姐，我暂时不回伦敦。你舅舅心地慈善，给了我一份整理他藏画的小差事，我俩似乎都对莫兰德抱有热诚。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The sight makes me giddy. I imagine the house walls cracking -- gaping -- collapsing in the concussion of his presence. I am only afraid they will do so before I have had my chance to escape.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这景象令我晕眩。在我想象中，这宅子的墙壁因他的出现而大受冲击，四分五裂，支离破碎，分崩离析。而我生怕这一切会在我抓住机会逃走前发生。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But I am afraid, too, of escaping. I think he knows it. He cannot speak privately with me, once Mr Huss and Mr Hawtrey have gone; and he does not dare to steal his way, a second time, to my own rooms. But he knows he must secure me to his plan. He waits, and watches. He takes his supper with us, still; but sits at my uncle's side, not mine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，我也害怕逃脱本身。我想他清楚这一点。哈斯先生和霍粹先生一走，他就不能跟我单独讲话了。他不会胆大包天到再次摸进我的房间。他也清楚，我加入计划，他才好高枕无忧。他耐心等待，小心观察。他还是跟我们一起用晚餐；却是坐在我舅舅旁边，而不是我旁边。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I am standing, thinking this, hearing his step fade, when Richard returns to the gallery from the floors above. He does not look for me, does not know that I am there, still there, in the shadow of the fastened front door. He only walks; but he walks briskly, his fingers drumming the gallery rail. I think perhaps he even whistles, or hums. We are not used to such sounds at Briar, and with my passion raised and set smarting by my uncle's words they strike me now as thrilling, perilous, like a shifting of timbers and beams. I think the dust must be rising in a cloud from the antique carpets beneath his shoes; and when I raise my eyes to follow his tread I am sure I can see fine crumbs of paint flake and tumble from the ceiling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我站在那儿寻思着，耳听得他脚步声渐渐隐去，这时理查德从楼上回来经过过厅，他没看我，他不知道我在，不知道我还站在紧闭大门边的暗处。他走过去了，步履轻快，手指点着过厅的扶栏。我想，也许他还吹着口哨呢，不然就是哼着小曲。在布莱尔，我们不常听到这种声音，而我血性渐起，正体味到我舅舅言辞给我的刺痛，这声音在我听来，充满危险，令我毛骨悚然，犹如危梁悬顶时那若有若无的滑动声。我觉得他走过去时，脚下古旧地毯上的灰尘升腾而起，云雾阵阵的；我目光追随他的脚步，我确信，我看到天花板上的油漆碎片都扑簌簌飞舞下来。">查看中文翻译</div>

She will see him take his place at my side, guide my fingers in the making of curves and crooked lines. He will drop his voice. Men's voices do badly in murmurs, as a rule -- they break, they jar, they long to rise -- but his can fall, insinuate, and yet, like a musical note, stay clear; and while she sits and sews, half the length of a room away, he will take me, in secret, point by point across his scheme, until the scheme is perfect.</div>

No-one, perhaps, save Mrs Stiles. For I think only she, of anyone there, ever gazes at Richard and wonders if he is all the gentleman he claims to be. I catch her look, sometimes.

Should I really be able to keep from going to her, if she did? I do not know. But, she does not, her voice only lifts high, in surprise, in indignation and then -- I suppose -- a kind of panic; but then it drops, is stifled or soothed, gives way in a moment to whispers, to the rub of linen or limbs… Then the rub becomes silence. And the silence is worst of all: not an absence of sound, but teeming -- as they say clear water teems, when viewed through a lens -- with kicks and squirming movements. I imagine her shuddering, weeping, her clothes put back -- but her freckled arms closing, despite herself, about his plunging back, her white mouth seeking out his -- I put my hands to my own mouth; and feel the dry chafe of my gloves.

<div class="line_en">There comes a knock upon my door. How should I stand? I stand at the fire. Does my voice sound queer, when I call out? Does she mark it? Does she hold her breath? I know I hold mine; then I feel myself colour, and will the blood from my face. The door is opened. Mrs Stiles comes first and, after a moment's hesitation, she is before me: Susan -- Susan Smith -- Suky Tawdry -- the gullible girl, who is to take my life from me and give me freedom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="门上响起叩门声。我该如何是好？我站在壁炉旁。我招呼她的声音，听上去会否有些怪异？她是否屏住了呼吸？我知道我是；然后我自觉脸上变了颜色，我强自抑住涌起的血色。门开了。斯黛尔太太先进来，有一瞬的犹疑，她出现在我面前：苏珊——是苏珊·史密斯——茶壶面孔——轻信的女孩，她将自我处得到我的一切，然后赋予我自由新生。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I have lain all night, sometimes sleeping, sometimes waking, oppressed with the nearness and obscurity of her.

<div class="line_en">Sharper than expectation, comes dismay. I have supposed she will resemble me, I have supposed she will be handsome: but she is a small, slight, spotted thing, with hair the colour of dust. Her chin comes almost to a point. Her eyes are brown, darker than mine. Her gaze is now too frank, now sly: she gives me a single, searching look that takes in my gown, my gloves, my slippers, the very clocks upon my stockings.</div>

<div class="line_en">We are watched by Mrs Stiles. Her look says plainly: "Here is the girl you sent for, to London. She is about good enough for you, I think."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯黛尔太太在旁观望。她的表情很坦白，仿佛在说：“这就是你从伦敦找来的姑娘，我觉得给你用，她绰绰有余呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You need not stay, Mrs Stiles," I say. And then, as she turns to go: "But you will have been kind to Miss Smith, I know." I look again at Susan. "You've heard, perhaps, that I am an orphan, Susan; like you. I came to Briar as a child -- very young, and with no-one at all to care for me. I cannot tell you all the ways in which Mrs Stiles has made me know what a mother's love is, since that time…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你不必待在这儿，斯黛尔太太。”我说道。然后，待她转身欲离去：“不过我知道，你会善待史密斯小姐的。”我又望着苏姗。“你也许听说过，我是个孤儿，苏珊，跟你一样。我很小就来到布莱尔——很小，根本没人喜欢我。从那时起，斯黛尔太太就无微不至照料我，让我了解母爱为何物，她待我好得难以言表。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then she blinks -- remembers her training, I suppose -- makes a hasty curtsey. She is pleased with the curtsey, I can tell. She is pleased with me. She thinks me a fool. The idea upsets me, more than it should. I think, You have come to Briar to ruin me. I step to take her hand. Won't you colour, or tremble, or hide your eyes? But she returns my gaze and her fingers -- which are bitten, about the nails -- are cold and hard and perfectly steady in mine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后她眨眨眼——我猜是记起了她得到的训示——向我草草地行了个屈膝礼。我敢说她对这个屈膝礼颇感满足。她对我也颇感满意。她觉得我是个傻瓜。这想法令我不爽，而我本不该为此烦恼。我想，你到布莱尔来，来毁灭我。我上前，拉起她的手。你就不脸红吗？不颤抖吗？眼神不闪躲吗？而她迎着我的目光，她的手指——那指甲被啃过——冰冷僵硬，在我手中沉稳异常。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I say this, smiling. The tormenting of my uncle's housekeeper is too routine an occupation, however, to hold me. It is Susan I want; and when Mrs Stiles has twitched and coloured and left us, I draw her to me, to lead her to the fire. She walks. She sits. She is warm and quick. I touch her arm. It is as slender as Agnes's, but hard. I can smell beer upon her breath. She speaks. Her voice is not at all how I have dreamed it, but light and pert; though she tries to make it sweeter. She tells me of her journey, of the train from London -- when she says the word, London, she seems conscious of the sound; I suppose she is not in the habit of naming it, of considering it a place of destination or desire. It is a wonder and a torment to me that a girl so slight, so trifling as she, should have lived her life in London, while mine has been all at Briar; but a consolation, also -- for if she can thrive there, then might not I, with all my talents, thrive better?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我微笑着说出这番话。其实，折腾我舅舅的管家，对我而言，实在太过稀松平常。我想要的是苏珊；斯黛尔太太抽搐一下，脸色一变，退下了。我拉着她的手，带她到了壁炉边。她跟着我，坐下来。她温暖而轻快。我碰到她的胳膊。她胳膊跟阿格尼丝的一样纤细，却更结实。我闻到她气息中的啤酒味，她说话，声音跟我梦到的完全不同，语音轻盈跳跃，颇有些粗鲁；虽然她尽力使声音柔美。她给我讲述旅途种种，从伦敦来时火车上的种种——当她提到那个字眼，伦敦，她似乎对此颇有感触。我猜她是不习惯直呼其名，不习惯将其当作向往之地或思念之乡。象她这么一个如此渺小，如此微不足道的姑娘，都能生活在伦敦，而我却在布莱尔苦熬，这个想法对于我，既是个问题，又是种折磨；不过其中也有少许安慰——因为，如果她能在伦敦讨生活，那以我的天赋才能，不是更会如鱼得水吗？">查看中文翻译</div>

I must keep her from that, more even than my uncle must! -- and while he jerks and screams I go softly to her, and touch her. She flinches at the feel of my fingers. I say, "Don't be frightened, Susan." I show her the brass hand in the floor. I have forgotten that, of course, she might look at anything there, anything at all, it would be so much ink upon paper.

She eats three eggs, spooning them quickly, neatly into her mouth -- not shuddering at the yielding of the yolk, not thinking, as she swallows, of the closing of her own throat about the meat.

She does not know it. She will not know it until, too late, she will look and see how it has clothed and changed her, made her like me. For now, she is only tired, restless, bored: I take her walking about the park, and she follows, lead-enly; we sit and sew, and she yawns and rubs her eyes, gazing at nothing. She chews her fingernails -- stops, when she sees me looking; then after a minute draws down a length of hair and bites the tip of that.</div>

At ten she puts me into my bed. After that, she stands in her room and I hear her sighing, and I lift my head and see her stretch and droop. Her candle lights her, very plainly; though I lie hidden in the dark. Quietly she passes, back and forth across the doorway -- now stooping to pick up a fallen lace; now taking up her cloak and brushing mud from its hem. She does not kneel and pray, as Agnes did. She sits on her bed, out of my sight, but lifts her feet: I see the toe of one shoe put to the heel of the other and work it down. Now she stands, to undo the buttons of her gown; now she lets it fall, steps awkwardly out of her skirt; unlaces her stays, rubs her waist, sighs again. Now she steps away. I lift my head, to follow. She comes back, in her nightgown -- shivering. I shiver, in sympathy. She yawns. I also yawn. She stretches -- enjoying the stretch -- liking the approach of slumber!

<div class="line_en">How effortless it seems! But when I have locked my mother's face away I lie, uneasily. My uncle's clock shudders and strikes. Some animal shrieks, like a child, in the park. I close my eyes and think -- what I have not thought so vividly of, in years -- of the madhouse, my first home; of the wild-eyed women, the lunatics; and of the nurses. I remember all at once the nurses' rooms, the mattings of coir, a piece of text on the limewashed wall: My meat is to do the will of Him that sent me. I remember an attic stair, a walk upon the roof, the softness of lead beneath my fingernail, the frightful drop to the ground -- I must fall into sleep, thinking this. I must plunge to the deepest layers of the night.</div>

I think her wary, at first; but it is only the canopy and drapes that trouble her: she stands each time with a lifted candle, peering into the folds of cloth.

But in Sue's hands, the deck is changed: she gathers and sorts it, shuffles and deals it, neatly and nimbly; and the golds and reds are vivid between her fingers, like so many jewels. She is astonished, of course, to learn I cannot play; and at once makes me sit, so she may teach me. The games are things of chance and simple speculation, but she plays earnestly, almost greedily -- tilting her head, narrowing her eye as she surveys her fan of cards. When I grow tired, she plays alone -- or else, will stand the cards upon their ends and tilt their tips together, and from doing this many times will build a rising structure, a kind of pyramid of cards -- always keeping back, for the top-most point, a king and a queen.</div>
