<div class="line_en">Finally, Mom and Dad came hurrying out the front door, looking alarmed. I guess they heard my shouts. "I can't find Josh or Petey!" I yelled up to them from the street.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="终于，妈妈和爸爸满脸惊恐地从前门跑了出来。我想他们是听到我的喊声了。“乔西和皮皮都不见了，”我从街上朝他们大喊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I ran down to the bottom of the driveway and peered into the car, but they weren't there. Mom and Dad were still inside talking with Mr. Dawes. I looked along the street in both directions, but there was no sign of them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我跑到车道尽头，看看车里，没有。妈妈和爸爸还在屋里跟道斯先生谈着。我把街道上下都看了个遍，连个影子都没有。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I headed up the driveway, kicking away dead leaves as I ran. It was sunny down on the street, but as soon as I entered our yard, I was back in the shade, and it was immediately cool again.</div>

<div class="line_en">I ran full speed along the side of the house. Tall trees leaned over the house on this side, blocking out nearly all of the sunlight.</div>

<div class="line_en">The backyard was bigger than I'd expected, a long rectangle that sloped gradually down to a wooden fence at the back. Just like the front, this yard was a mass of tall weeds, poking up through a thick covering of brown leaves. A stone birdbath had toppled onto its side. Beyond it, I could see the side of the garage, a dark, brick building that matched the house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后院比我想象的要大，长长的长方形，地面有些倾斜，边上是一道木栅栏。跟前院一样，厚厚的落叶间，长满了又高又密的野草，一只鸟浴缸翻倒在一边。再远处，可以看到车库的侧墙。那是一间黑乎乎的砖屋，颜色跟房子很相衬。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Hey -- Josh!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嘿——乔西！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No sign of him," I said, surprised at how worried I felt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没见他，”我答道，为自己如此担心而感到吃惊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well?" Out of breath, Dad came jogging up to me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“怎么样？”爸爸喘着粗气，朝我跑过来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I do," Dad said, rolling his eyes. "You know your brother when he doesn't get his way. Maybe he wants us to think he's run away from home." He frowned.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我倒相信，”爸爸翻了翻白眼说。“你知道你弟弟不顺心时会怎么做。也许他想让我们觉得他离家出走了。”他皱着眉头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes. It's the first place I looked." I gave the backyard a last quick search. "I don't believe Josh would just take off."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“看过了，最先看的。”我最后快速把后院找了一遍。“我不信乔西会一个人跑了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He wasn't back here. I stopped and searched the ground for footprints or a sign that he had run through the thick leaves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他不在那。我停下来，仔细查看地面，看看是否有脚印或者他踩过落叶留下的痕迹。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“找到没有？”我们回到前院时妈妈问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Did you check the car?" He sounded more angry than worried.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你看过车子没有？”爸爸的口气显得生气甚过担心。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"We've got to find him," Mom said, gazing down to the street. "He doesn't know this neighborhood at all. He probably wandered off and got lost."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们必须找到他，”妈妈盯着街道说。“他对这一带不熟悉，说不定走走就迷路了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mr. Dawes locked the front door and stepped down off the porch, pocketing the keys. "He couldn't have gotten far," he said, giving Mom a reassuring smile. "Let's drive around the block. I'm sure we'll find him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="道斯先生锁上前门，把钥匙放进口袋，走下门廊。“他不会走远的，”他笑着安慰妈妈，“我们开车在这个街区转一圈，肯定能找到他。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dad and I both shrugged. "Maybe he made a friend and wandered off," Dad said. He raised a hand and scratched his curly brown hair. I could tell that he was starting to worry, too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我和爸爸耸了耸肩。“也许他交了新朋友，跟人家走了，”爸爸说着，举手抓了抓头发。看得出，爸爸也开始担忧了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mom shook her head and glanced nervously at Dad. "I'll kill him," she muttered. Dad patted her on the shoulder.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="妈妈摇摇头，焦虑地看了一眼爸爸。“我会收拾他，”她喃喃自语地说，爸爸安慰地拍了拍她的肩膀。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mr. Dawes opened the trunk of the small Honda, pulled off his dark blazer, and tossed it inside. Then he took out a wide-brimmed, black cowboy hat and put it on his head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="道斯先生打开他那小本田车的后备箱，脱下外衣，扔了进去。然后，他拿出一顶宽边的黑色牛仔帽戴在头上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Keeps the sun away," Mr. Dawes said, sliding behind the wheel and slamming the car door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“挡太陽用的，”道斯先生边说边侧身坐进驾驶座，砰的一声关上车门。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mom and I got in back. Glancing over at her, I saw that Mom was as worried as I was.</div>

<div class="line_en">We headed down the block in silence, all four of us staring out the car windows. The houses we passed all seemed old. Most of them were even bigger than our house. All of them seemed to be in better condition, nicely painted with neat, well-trimmed lawns.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们沿街往下驶，大家默不作声，眼睛盯住窗外。沿街的房子都很陈旧，多数比我们的大，也比我们的要好些，草坪修剪得很整齐。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Where is that son of mine?" Dad asked, staring hard out the windshield.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这小子到底跑哪儿去了？”爸爸问，透过挡风玻璃使劲地看前面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It certainly is a quiet neighborhood, I thought. And shady. The houses all seemed to be surrounded by tall, leafy trees. The front yards we drove slowly past all seemed to be bathed in shade. The street was the only sunny place, a narrow gold ribbon that ran through the shadows on both sides.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一带真的好安静，我想，又很陰凉。所有房子四周都是枝繁叶茂的大树，院子都在树荫笼罩之下。街道是陽光能照到的唯一地带，宛如穿越陰暗地带的一条狭长的金丝带。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I didn't see any people in the houses or yards, and there was no one on the street.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那些房子和院子里都没见什么人，街上也是空空的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'll kill him. I really will," Mom muttered. It wasn't the first time she had said that about Josh.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“看我怎么收拾他，我肯定会的，”妈妈喃喃自语地说，都不知道她说了多少遍了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We had gone around the block twice. No sign of him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们绕着街区转了两圈，还是没见他的影子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Maybe that's why it's called Dark Falls, I thought.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我想，也许这就是镇子取名黑瀑布的缘故吧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mr. Dawes suggested we drive around the next few blocks, and Dad quickly agreed. "Hope I don't get lost. I'm new here, too," Mr. Dawes said, turning a corner. "Hey, there's the school," he announced, pointing out the window at a tall redbrick building. It looked very old-fashioned, with white columns on both sides of the double front doors. "Of course, it's closed now," Mr. Dawes added.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="道斯先生建议到远一些的几个街区转一转，爸爸马上表示赞成。“希望我不会迷路，这一带我也不熟，”道斯先生说着转入另一条街。“喏，学校就在那儿，”他指着外面的一座高大的红砖楼说。那是一栋旧式建筑，前门有两个入口，两侧是白色的圆柱。“当然，现在关着呢，”道斯先生补充道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Could Josh have walked this far?" Mom asked, her voice tight and higher than usual.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“乔西会走得这么远吗？”妈妈问，声音有些发紧，调子也比平时高。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Josh doesn't walk," Dad said, rolling his eyes. "He runs."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他才不会走呢，”爸爸翻了翻白眼说。“他只会跑。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My eyes searched the fenced-in playground behind the school. It was empty. No one there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我看了看学校后面用围栏围起来的运动场，那里空无一人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We'll find him," Mr. Dawes said confidently, tapping his fingers on the wheel as he steered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们会找到他的，”道斯先生信心十足地说，一边开车一边用手指敲打着方向盘。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A few shrubs dotted the cemetery, but there weren't many trees. As we drove slowly past, the gravestones passing by in a blur on the left, I realized that this was the sunniest spot I had seen in the whole town.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="墓碑之间点缀着几簇灌木丛，树很少。车开得很慢，但是，左侧车窗外的墓碑却显得模糊不清。我突然发觉，墓地是整个镇子陽光最灿烂的地方。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We turned a corner onto another shady block. A street sign read "Cemetery Drive", and sure enough, a large cemetery rose up in front of us. Granite gravestones rolled along a low hill, which sloped down and then up again onto a large flat stretch, also marked with rows of low grave markers and monuments.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们拐到另一个街区，街牌显示“公墓街”，眼前果真出现一个很大的墓地。那是一座矮山丘，从高到低是一排排花岗岩墓碑。再往上是一大片平地，布满了低矮的墓碑和纪念碑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, thank goodness!" Mom exclaimed, leaning down to see out the window on my side of the car.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，谢天谢地！”妈妈高兴地说，低下身子，靠到我这边，往窗外看。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There's your son." Mr. Dawes, pointing out the window, stopped the car suddenly.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sure enough, there was Josh, running wildly along a crooked row of low, white gravestones. "What's he doing here?" I asked, pushing open my car door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乔西真的在那，沿着弯弯的一排白色墓碑猛跑。“他在这里干什么？”我问，说着推开了车门。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I stepped down from the car, took a few steps onto the grass, and called to him. At first, he didn't react to my shouts. He seemed to be ducking and dodging through the tombstones. He would run in one direction, then cut to the side, then head in another direction.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我下了车，朝草地走了几步，然后喊乔西。一开始，他一点反应都没有。他好像在墓碑之间躲躲藏藏，一会儿往这边跑，一会儿突然转身，跑到另一边。">查看中文翻译</div>
