<div class="line_en">There was a cold wind this afternoon, but the sun shone for an hour or two. I walked out on the moors behind the house. The sheep were hiding from the wind under the stone walls, and there were grey clouds over the hills to the west. It is only November, but I could smell snow in the air.</div>

<div class="line_en">My name is Patrick Bronte. I'm 78 years old. the rector of the village of Haworth. Haworth is a village of small, grey stone houses on the side of a hill in the north of England, and I live in a house at the top of the hill, next to the church and the graveyard.</div>

<div class="line_en">I walked through the graveyard to the church this afternoon. All my family except Anne are buried there. The wind had blown some dead leaves through the door into the church, and I watched them dancing in the sunlight near the grave. Soon I shall be in that grave with my wife and children, under the cold grey stone and dancing leaves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="今天下午，我步行穿过墓地去教堂。除了安妮，我的一家都葬在这里。冷风卷起了一些枯叶，把它们从教堂的大门吹了进来，我注视着它们在墓地旁的阳光中上下飞舞。要不了多久我也会躺在这个墓地中，在这冰冷的灰色石头和纷飞的落叶下，同我的妻子和孩子们长眠在一起。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It is dark outside now, and it is very quiet in this house. Charlotte's husband, Mr Nicholls, is reading in his room, and our servant is cooking in the kitchen. Only the three of us live here now. It is very quiet. I can hear the sounds of the wood burning in the fire, and the big clock on the stairs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时外面黑了下来，整幢房子非常安静。夏洛蒂的丈夫尼科尔斯先生，正在自己的房间里看书，我们的用人正在厨房做饭。这儿只有我们三个人，真是太安静了！我能听见木柴在炉火中燃烧的声音和楼梯上大钟的嘀哒声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There is another sound too -- the sound of the wind outside. The wind has many voices. It sings and laughs and shouts to itself all night long. Last night it cried like a little child, and I got out of bed and went to the window to listen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="还有另一种声音——那就是屋外风的吼叫。风有着各种各样的声音，它总是整宿整宿地笑呀，哭呀，喊呀。而昨夜它呜咽得像个孩子。我下了床，走近窗边侧耳细听。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was no child, of course. Only the wind and the grave-stones, cold in the pale moonlight. But I decided then that I would write the story of my children, today, before it is too late. Charlotte's friend, Mrs Gaskell, is writing a book about her, and perhaps she will want to read my story.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然不会有孩子，只有风和苍白月光下冰冷的墓碑。然而我还是决定就在今天，趁还没有太晚，写写我的孩子们的故事。夏洛蒂的朋友盖斯凯尔夫人正在写一部关于夏洛蒂的书，也许她会愿意读读我的故事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a strong wind blowing that day too, out of a dark, cloudy sky. We could see snow on the moors. The road to Haworth goes up a hill, and there was ice on the stones of the road Maria, my wife, was afraid to ride up the hill in the carts.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天，昏暗多云的天空一整天都刮着强劲的风。我们能看到旷野上覆盖的雪。去霍沃斯的路沿着山坡向上而去，一路上的石头都结了冰。玛丽亚，我的妻子怕坐马车上山。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She was a small woman, my wife, and not very strong. But she carried the baby, Anne, up the hill in her arms. I carried Emily -- she was one and a half years old then. The others walked. My two-year-old son, Patrick Branwell, walked with me, and Charlotte, who was nearly four, walked with her mother. The two oldest children -- Elizabeth and Maria -- ran on in front. They were very excited, and laughed and talked all the way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我的妻子个子不高，身体也不好，可她还是抱着小女儿安妮往山上爬。我抱着一岁半的爱米丽，其他人都步行。两岁的儿子帕特里克·布兰韦尔和我走在一起；快四岁的夏洛蒂跟着妈妈；两个最大的孩子，伊丽莎白和小玛丽亚跑在前面。她们非常兴奋，一路上又说又笑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Do you like it, my dear?" I asked her that night, when the children were in bed. She looked pale and tired. I thought it was because of the long journey, and the children. Perhaps it was.</div>

She came from Penzance in Cornwall, a warm, sunny place by the sea in the south -- west of England. It is often cold on the moors behind Haworth, and the winds blow all winter.

I talked to them about adult things: the Duke of Wellington, and the important things that he was doing in London. The children listened carefully, and tried hard to understand. Maria often read to the others from the newspaper, and asked me questions about it. She understood it better than most men.</div>
