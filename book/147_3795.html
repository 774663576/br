<div class="line_en">There were six in Mrs. Bowden's party: Max Isaacs, Malvin Bowden, Eugene, two girls named Josie and Louise, and Mrs. Bowden. Josie was Mrs. Bowden's niece and lived with her. She was a tall beanpole of a girl with a prognathous mouth and stick-out grinning teeth. She was twenty. The other girl, Louise, was a waitress. She was small, plump, a warm brunette. Mrs. Bowden was a little sallow woman with ratty brown hair. She had brown worn-out eyes. She was a dressmaker. Her husband, a carpenter, had died in the Spring. There was a little insurance money. That was how she came to take the trip.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="包顿夫人一行共有6人：迈克斯·艾萨克、马温·包顿、尤金、乔西和露易丝，还有包顿夫人。乔西是包顿夫人的侄女，现在与她生活在一起。她身材瘦高，下巴外突，牙齿外龇，今年20岁。那位名叫露易丝的姑娘是一位女服务员。她是个矮小、丰满的小胖墩，性格热情、头发黑黑的。包顿夫人是一个皮肤暗黄、身材娇小的女人，长着一头蓬乱的褐色头发。她的眼睛是褐色的，看上去眼神黯淡，神情疲惫。她的职业是裁缝。她的丈夫是一位木匠，那年春天刚去世，她拿到了一点保险金。这就是她外出旅行的主要原因了。于是在黑夜里，他又一次坐上火车朝南方进发。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now, by night, he was riding once more into the South. The day-coach was hot, full of the weary smell of old red plush. People dozed painfully, distressed by the mournful tolling of the bell, and the grinding halts. A baby wailed thinly. Its mother, a gaunt wisp-haired mountaineer, turned the back of the seat ahead, and bedded the child on a spread newspaper. Its wizened face peeked dirtily out of its swaddling discomfort of soiled jackets and pink ribbon. It wailed and slept. At the front of the car, a young hill-man, high-boned and red, clad in corduroys and leather leggings, shelled peanuts steadily, throwing the shells into the aisle. People trod through them with a sharp masty crackle. The boys, bored, paraded restlessly to the car-end for water. There was a crushed litter of sanitary drinking-cups upon the floor, and a stale odor from the toilets.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="客车车厢里很热，而且满鼻子都是红色旧绒布座椅的气味。人们都困乏得打着盹，丧钟的哀鸣和火车停车时的刹车声都让他们非常不舒服。从不远的地方依稀传来婴儿的啼哭声，孩子的母亲是一位面容憔悴、头发扎成一束的山里女人。她把前座的椅背转过来，在上面铺了一张报纸，然后把孩子放在上面。孩子的身上裹着脏兮兮的外套和粉红色的带子。那张又瘦又脏的小脸透过襁褓向外张望着，哭了一会儿便睡着了。车厢前端坐着一个年轻的山里人，高颧骨、红面庞，身穿灯芯绒衣裤和皮绑腿，不停地剥着花生吃，随手把花生壳扔在过道的地板上，乘客们踩在上面发出刺耳的噼啪声。旅行团的几个孩子感到非常无聊，不时排着队到车厢的尾部去接水喝。地板上扔了许多被踩烂的卫生纸杯，厕所里散发出一阵尿臊味。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The weariness of the night wore in upon their jaded nerves, lay upon their dry hot eyeballs. They flattened noses against the dirty windows, and watched the vast structure of the earth sweep past -- clumped woodlands, the bending sweep of the fields, the huge flowing lift of the earth-waves, cyclic intersections bewildering -- the American earth -- rude, immeasurable, formless, mighty.</div>

<div class="line_en">His mind was bound in the sad lulling magic of the car wheels. Clackety-clack. Clackety-clack. Clackety-clack. Clackety-clack. He thought of his life as something that had happened long ago. He had found, at last, his gateway to the lost world. But did it lie before or behind him? Was he leaving or entering it? Above the rhythm of the wheels he thought of Eliza's laughter over ancient things. He saw a brief forgotten gesture, her white broad forehead, a ghost of old grief in her eyes. Ben, Gant -- their strange lost voices. Their sad laughter. They swam toward him through green walls of fantasy. They caught and twisted at his heart. The green ghost-glimmer of their faces coiled away. Lost. Lost.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尤金的思想沉浸在车轮发出的沉闷而带有魔力的催眠声中。咔嗒——咔嗒，咔嗒——咔嗒，咔嗒——咔嗒。他感到自己的一生好像已经是很久以前的事了。他终于找到了自己迷失的世界之门。可是这扇门究竟在他的前方还是在后方？他是离开还是走进它？在车轮发出的节奏声里，他想起了伊丽莎嘲笑那些久远往事的声音。他看见了她的一举一动、她宽阔白净的额头、她双目中忧郁的阴影，而此前他早已经遗忘了这一切。本恩、甘特——他们陌生而迷惘的声音，他们悲伤的笑声，他们隐隐约约地浮现在他幻想中的绿色墙壁上，他们紧紧抓住并绞痛了他的心。慢慢地，他们那鬼影幢幢的绿色脸庞又悄然离去，失去了。失去了。">查看中文翻译</div>

Still buried in night, they looked across at the unimpinging sheet of day. They looked under the lifted curtain at brightness. They were knifed sharply away from it. Then, gently, light melted across the land like dew. The world was gray.</div>

<div class="line_en">Max Isaacs fumbled his cigarette awkwardly, looked at Eugene, and grinned sheepishly with delight, craning his neck along his collar, and making a nervous grimace of his white fuzz-haired face. His hair was thick, straight, the color of taffy. He had blond eyebrows. There was much kindness in him. They looked at each other with clumsy tenderness. They thought of the lost years at Woodson Street. They saw with decent wonder their awkward bulk of puberty. The proud gate of the years swung open for them. They felt a lonely glory. They said farewell.</div>

The wing of a chicken, no doubt, and a glass of dry sherry. Meanwhile, all the valuable heirlooms had been pawned or sold. Fortunately, she was almost blind, and could not see the wastage of their fortune. It was very sad. But did she not sometimes think of that old time of the wine and the roses? When knighthood was in flower?</div>
