<div class="line_en">I was sick -- sick unto death with that long agony; and when they at length unbound me, and I was permitted to sit, I felt that my senses were leaving me. The sentence -- the dread sentence of death -- was the last of distinct accentuation which reached my ears. After that, the sound of the inquisitorial voices seemed merged in one dreamy indeterminate hum. It conveyed to my soul the idea of revolution -- perhaps from its association in fancy with the burr of a mill-wheel. This only for a brief period; for presently I heard no more. Yet, for a while, I saw; but with how terrible an exaggeration! I saw the lips of the black-robed judges. They appeared to me white -- whiter than the sheet upon which I trace these words -- and thin even to grotesqueness; thin with the intensity of their expression of firmness -- of immoveable resolution -- of stern contempt of human torture. I saw that the decrees of what to me was Fate, were still issuing from those lips. I saw them writhe with a deadly locution. I saw them fashion the syllables of my name; and I shuddered because no sound succeeded. I saw, too, for a few moments of delirious horror, the soft and nearly imperceptible waving of the sable draperies which enwrapped the walls of the apartment. And then my vision fell upon the seven tall candles upon the table. At first they wore the aspect of charity, and seemed white and slender angels who would save me; but then, all at once, there came a most deadly nausea over my spirit, and I felt every fibre in my frame thrill as if I had touched the wire of a galvanic battery, while the angel forms became meaningless spectres, with heads of flame, and I saw that from them there would be no help. And then there stole into my fancy, like a rich musical note, the thought of what sweet rest there must be in the grave. The thought came gently and stealthily, and it seemed long before it attained full appreciation; but just as my spirit came at length properly to feel and entertain it, the figures of the judges vanished, as if magically, from before me; the tall candles sank into nothingness; their flames went out utterly; the blackness of darkness supervened; all sensations appeared swallowed up in a mad rushing descent as of the soul into Hades. Then silence, and stillness, and night were the universe.</div>

<div class="line_en">I had swooned; but still will not say that all of consciousness was lost. What of it there remained I will not attempt to define, or even to describe; yet all was not lost. In the deepest slumber -- no! In delirium -- no! In a swoon -- no! In death -- no! even in the grave all is not lost. Else there is no immortality for man. Arousing from the most profound of slumbers, we break the gossamer web of some dream. Yet in a second afterward, (so frail may that web have been) we remember not that we have dreamed. In the return to life from the swoon there are two stages; first, that of the sense of mental or spiritual; secondly, that of the sense of physical, existence. It seems probable that if, upon reaching the second stage, we could recall the impressions of the first, we should find these impressions eloquent in memories of the gulf beyond. And that gulf is -- what? How at least shall we distinguish its shadows from those of the tomb? But if the impressions of what I have termed the first stage, are not, at will, recalled, yet, after long interval, do they not come unbidden, while we marvel whence they come? He who has never (1) swooned, is not he who finds strange palaces and wildly familiar faces in coals that glow; is not he who beholds floating in mid-air the sad visions that the many may not view; is not he who ponders over the perfume of some novel flower -- is not he whose brain grows bewildered with the meaning of some musical cadence which has never before arrested his attention.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我昏迷过去了。但也不能说丧失了全部意识。至于还剩余点什么意识，我不打算详加说明，也不愿去描述。不过真的并没有丧失全部意识。在酣睡中——并非如此！在狂乱中——并非如此！在昏迷中——并非如此！在死亡中——并非如此！即便在坟墓中，也不是完全失去意识。否则就没有灵魂不死这一说法了。当我们从沉沉睡梦中醒来，就像是打破了薄薄的丝网般的梦。可转眼间，我们就不记得自己做过梦了。大概是因为丝网一触即破吧。从昏迷中醒转来，要经历两个阶段：首先是心理或精神上恢复意识，其次是肉体的苏醒。如果到了第二个阶段，还回忆得起第一个阶段的印象，那么，我们或许就该发现，这些印象极富雄辩，使得昏迷中的情况活灵活现起来。可昏迷是什么？如何才能把昏迷的预兆也死亡的预兆稍稍区分开？但是，如果我所说的第一阶段中的印象不能随意回想起来，隔一段日月后，难道那印象就不会不邀而至？而我们，惟有惊奇于它到底来自何方。从没昏迷过的人，决不会看到奇怪和宫殿与极为熟悉的面容，隐现在光闪闪的煤火中；决不会看到很多人看不大见的忧伤幻影，在半空载沉载浮；决不会对新奇的花香玩味良久；决不会被以前没聆听过的音乐旋律弄得心神惚惚。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Amid frequent and thoughtful endeavors to remember; amid earnest struggles to regather some token of the state of seeming nothingness into which my soul had lapsed, there have been moments when I have dreamed of success; there have been brief, very brief periods when I have conjured up remembrances which the lucid reason of a later epoch assures me could have had reference only to that condition of seeming unconsciousness. These shadows of memory tell, indistinctly, of tall figures that lifted and bore me in silence down -- down -- still down -- till a hideous dizziness oppressed me at the mere idea of the interminableness of the descent. They tell also of a vague horror at my heart, on account of that heart's unnatural stillness. Then comes a sense of sudden motionlessness throughout all things; as if those who bore me (a ghastly train!) had outrun, in their descent, the limits of the limitless, and paused from the wearisomeness of their toil. After this I call to mind flatness and dampness; and then all is madness -- the madness of a memory which busies itself among forbidden things.</div>

<div class="line_en">So far, I had not opened my eyes. I felt that I lay upon my back, unbound. I reached out my hand, and it fell heavily upon something damp and hard. There I suffered it to remain for many minutes, while I strove to imagine where and what I could be. I longed, yet dared not to employ my vision. I dreaded the first glance at objects around me. It was not that I feared to look upon things horrible, but that I grew aghast lest there should be nothing to see. At length, with a wild desperation at heart, I quickly unclosed my eyes. My worst thoughts, then, were confirmed. The blackness of eternal night encompassed me. I struggled for breath. The intensity of the darkness seemed to oppress and stifle me. The atmosphere was intolerably close. I still lay quietly, and made effort to exercise my reason. I brought to mind the inquisitorial proceedings, and attempted from that point to deduce my real condition. The sentence had passed; and it appeared to me that a very long interval of time had since elapsed. Yet not for a moment did I suppose myself actually dead. Such a supposition, notwithstanding what we read in fiction, is altogether inconsistent with real existence; -- but where and in what state was I? The condemned to death, I knew, perished usually at the auto-da-fes, and one of these had been held on the very night of the day of my trial. Had I been remanded to my dungeon, to await the next sacrifice, which would not take place for many months? This I at once saw could not be. Victims had been in immediate demand. Moreover, my dungeon, as well as all the condemned cells at Toledo, had stone floors, and light was not altogether excluded.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="直到今天，我都没睁开过眼睛。我觉得自己是躺着的，没被捆绑。我伸出手，摸到的是特别潮湿坚硬的东西，我把手放在那上面，忍受了好几分钟，一边心里琢磨着自己到底在哪里，自己究竟又是谁。我很想睁开眼看一看，可又不敢。我对第一眼将看到的周遭景况，心存畏惧，不是害怕看到可怕的东西，而是惟恐睁开眼后，什么都看不到。我愈来愈惊骇了。最后，心情极度绝望之下，我猛地睁开了眼睛。不出所料，果然糟透了。长夜漫漫，黑暗包围着我，我拼命地呼吸。无边的黑暗压迫着我，令我窒息。空气憋闷，难受极了。我仍然静静地躺着，开始尽力调动自己的理智。我想起了审讯的一幕，试图从那一点上推断出目前的真实情形。死刑判决宣布了。对我来说，那似乎是很久很久以前的事了。然而片刻后，我就推测自己其实已经死了。虽然我们在小说里看的离奇事很多，可这一推想还是完全与真实存在相矛盾。——但我在哪里？我又是什么状态？我知道，被宗教法庭判决死刑的，通常是捆在火刑柱上烧死。而在我受审的当晚，这样的刑罚已执行过一次。难道我已被押解回地牢，正等着数月后的再一次火刑？我马上就看出这不可能。因为该死的人总是立即被处死。再说了，我呆过的那间地牢，和托莱多城的所有死牢一样，都是石头地板，而且也并不是一丝光都没有。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Very suddenly there came back to my soul motion and sound -- the tumultuous motion of the heart, and, in my ears, the sound of its beating. Then a pause in which all is blank. Then again sound, and motion, and touch -- a tingling sensation pervading my frame. Then the mere consciousness of existence, without thought -- a condition which lasted long. Then, very suddenly, thought, and shuddering terror, and earnest endeavor to comprehend my true state. Then a strong desire to lapse into insensibility. Then a rushing revival of soul and a successful effort to move. And now a full memory of the trial, of the judges, of the sable draperies, of the sentence, of the sickness, of the swoon. Then entire forgetfulness of all that followed; of all that a later day and much earnestness of endeavor have enabled me vaguely to recall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然，我的灵魂中又有了声音和动作意识——心脏一阵喧嚣，耳边就是心脏激越的跳动声。而后，是片刻的静止，大脑也随之一片空白。再接着，还是声音、动作、还有触摸——一种刺痛感遍布全身。然后意识中就是没有了思想，只知道自己是存在的。这一状况持续了很久。再后来，突然之间，思想复活了、心弦战栗的恐惧感回来了，一种想要了解自身真实处境的努力，也蓬勃起来。之后，便强烈渴望坠入无知觉的境地。精神完全苏醒了。手脚可以动了。随之而来是，则是重重记忆，法庭、法官、黑色幔帐、判决、生病以及昏迷；再之后，是所遗忘的一切，是过了些日子、经艰辛努力才模模糊糊回忆起的一切。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A fearful idea now suddenly drove the blood in torrents upon my heart, and for a brief period, I once more relapsed into insensibility. Upon recovering, I at once started to my feet, trembling convulsively in every fibre. I thrust my arms wildly above and around me in all directions. I felt nothing; yet dreaded to move a step, lest I should be impeded by the walls of a tomb. Perspiration burst from every pore, and stood in cold big beads upon my forehead. The agony of suspense, grew at length intolerable, and I cautiously moved forward, with my arms extended, and my eyes straining from their sockets, in the hope of catching some faint ray of light. I proceeded for many paces; but still all was blackness and vacancy. I breathed more freely. It seemed evident that mine was not, at least, the most hideous of fates.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然，一个可怕的念头闪现了。我立刻血液奔涌，心跳加剧。有一瞬间，我又失去了知觉。一醒过来，我马上跳了起来，抖得浑身痉挛。我伸出双手，上下左右朝着各个方向摸了一通，可我什么都没摸到。但我还是寸步都不敢挪动，生怕墓墙挡了去路。我全身的每一个毛孔都在冒汗，额上挂满豆大的汗珠，冰凉冰凉的。我焦虑，痛苦，最后实在忍无可忍了，就小心翼翼地往前移了脚步。我的双手朝前伸得笔直。想着要捕捉到一丝微弱的光线，我的两眼又瞪得目眦欲裂。我前行了几步。依然是黑暗与虚空。我的呼吸畅快点了。显然，命运没那么糟，我至少不是呆在最可怕的墓地。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And now, as I still continued to step cautiously onward, there came thronging upon my recollection a thousand vague rumors of the horrors of Toledo. Of the dungeons there had been strange things narrated -- fables I had always deemed them -- but yet strange, and too ghastly to repeat, save in a whisper. Was I left to perish of starvation in this subterranean world of darkness; or what fate, perhaps even more fearful, awaited me? That the result would be death, and a death of more than customary bitterness, I knew too well the character of my judges to doubt. The mode and the hour were all that occupied or distracted me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在我一步一步小心谨慎地朝前摸索时，托莱多城许许多多暧昧的传闻都涌上了心头，其中也有地牢里的一些怪事——我认为不过是无稽之谈——但毕竟希奇古怪，可怕得让人不敢公开谈论，只有私下里流传。难道要把我关在这个暗无天日的地下活活饿死？或者还有更可怕的命运等着我？结果总归是个死，而且会死得比别人更痛苦。我对这一点丝毫都不怀疑，因为我太了解那些法官的德行了。我满心里想的，或者说让我心意烦乱的，只不过是怎样死，以及什么时间死。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">My outstretched hands at length encountered some solid obstruction. It was a wall, seemingly of stone masonry -- very smooth, slimy, and cold. I followed it up; stepping with all the careful distrust with which certain antique narratives had inspired me. This process, however, afforded me no means of ascertaining the dimensions of my dungeon; as I might make its circuit, and return to the point whence I set out, without being aware of the fact; so perfectly uniform seemed the wall. I therefore sought the knife which had been in my pocket, when led into the inquisitorial chamber; but it was gone; my clothes had been exchanged for a wrapper of coarse serge. I had thought of forcing the blade in some minute crevice of the masonry, so as to identify my point of departure. The difficulty, nevertheless, was but trivial; although, in the disorder of my fancy, it seemed at first insuperable. I tore a part of the hem from the robe and placed the fragment at full length, and at right angles to the wall. In groping my way around the prison, I could not fail to encounter this rag upon completing the circuit. So, at least I thought: but I had not counted upon the extent of the dungeon, or upon my own weakness. The ground was moist and slippery. I staggered onward for some time, when I stumbled and fell. My excessive fatigue induced me to remain prostrate; and sleep soon overtook me as I lay.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我伸出的手指终于碰到了某个坚固的障碍物。是一堵墙。好像是用石头堆砌的——光溜溜、黏糊糊、冷冰冰的。我于是就顺着墙走，每走一步，都小心翼翼、充满警惕。这是某些古老的故事赋予我的启示。可我这么走，并不能确定地牢的大小，因为我很可能是在绕圈子，说不定不知不觉又回到了原处。这堵墙到处都是一个样，于是我就去找那把小刀，我记得被带上法庭时它就在我的口袋里。可它不见了。我的衣服也换成了粗布长袍。我本想把小刀插进石壁的某条细缝，以便确定我起步的地方。尽管在心神迷乱中，那个困难初看似乎无法克服，其实，也不过是件小事。我从袍子的边缘撕下一缕布，把它平铺在地上，与墙面成直角。这样，在摸索着绕地牢走时，如果绕一个圈，就不可能踩不到这块布。但我没有考虑地牢的大小，也没有充分估计自己的虚弱。地面又湿又滑，我蹒跚着朝前走了一会儿，就踉跄一下摔倒了。我疲劳极了，就那么倒卧在地，不想起来。很快，睡意就不可遏制地袭来了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I had little object -- certainly no hope -- in these researches; but a vague curiosity prompted me to continue them. Quitting the wall, I resolved to cross the area of the enclosure. At first, I proceeded with extreme caution, for the floor, although seemingly of solid material, was treacherous with slime. At length, however, I took courage, and did not hesitate to step firmly -- endeavoring to cross in as direct a line as possible. I had advanced some ten or twelve paces in this manner, when the remnant of the torn hem of my robe became entangled between my legs. I stepped on it, and fell violently on my face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我决定不再顺着墙壁走，而是从地牢中央横穿一遭。开始我每迈上一步都极为小心，因为地面虽然似乎很牢固，但却非常容易滑倒。到后来，我鼓足了勇气，不再犹疑，步伐也就坚定多了。我要尽可能笔直地到达对面。如此大约走了十一二步，袍子上那撕扯后残存的碎边，在两腿间缠来缠去，我一脚踩了上去，狠狠地跌了一跤，摔了个嘴啃泥。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Upon awaking, and stretching forth an arm, I found beside me a loaf and a pitcher with water. I was too much exhausted to reflect upon this circumstance, but ate and drank with avidity. Shortly afterward, I resumed my tour around the prison, and with much toil, came at last upon the fragment of the serge. Up to the period when I fell, I had counted fifty-two paces, and, upon resuming my walk, I had counted forty-eight more -- when I arrived at the rag. There were in all, then, a hundred paces; and, admitting two paces to the yard, I presumed the dungeon to be fifty yards in circuit. I had met, however, with many angles in the wall, and thus I could form no guess at the shape of the vault; for vault I could not help supposing it to be.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当我醒过来时，我伸出了一只手臂，我发现，身旁有一块面包，还有一罐子水。我已筋疲力尽，没去想是怎么回事，就贪婪地吃喝开了。不久，我又开始了我的地牢之行。经过一番苦苦支撑，走到了放布条的地方。摔倒之前我已经数了五十二步，重新爬起来后，又走了四十八步才到布条那里。如此说来，总共是一百步。两步是一码，于是我推测地牢的周长是五十码。但在我摸索行走时，碰到了许多转角，所以我无法推断出这个地窖的形状。没错，我认为这就是个地窖。这次探究几乎没什么目的——当然也不抱任何希望，不过是出于一种朦朦胧胧的好奇心。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the confusion attending my fall, I did not immediately apprehend a somewhat startling circumstance, which yet, in a few seconds afterward, and while I still lay prostrate, arrested my attention. It was this: my chin rested upon the floor of the prison, but my lips, and the upper portion of my head, although seemingly at a less elevation than the chin, touched nothing. At the same time, my forehead seemed bathed in a clammy vapor, and the peculiar smell of decayed fungus arose to my nostrils. I put forward my arm, and shuddered to find that I had fallen at the very brink of a circular pit, whose extent, of course, I had no means of ascertaining at the moment. Groping about the masonry just below the margin, I succeeded in dislodging a small fragment, and let it fall into the abyss. For many seconds I hearkened to its reverberations as it dashed against the sides of the chasm in its descent: at length, there was a sullen plunge into water, succeeded by loud echoes.

<div class="line_en">I saw clearly the doom which had been prepared for me, and congratulated myself upon the timely accident by which I had escaped. Another step before my fall, and the world had seen me no more. And the death just avoided, was of that very character which I had regarded as fabulous and frivolous in the tales respecting the Inquisition. To the victims of its tyranny, there was the choice of death with its direst physical agonies, or death with its most hideous moral horrors. I had been reserved for the latter. By long suffering my nerves had been unstrung, until I trembled at the sound of my own voice, and had become in every respect a fitting subject for the species of torture which awaited me.</div>

<div class="line_en">Agitation of spirit kept me awake for many long hours; but at length I again slumbered. Upon arousing, I found by my side, as before, a loaf and a pitcher of water. A burning thirst consumed me, and I emptied the vessel at a draught. It must have been drugged -- for scarcely had I drunk, before I became irresistibly drowsy. A deep sleep fell upon me -- a sleep like that of death. How long it lasted, of course, I know not; but when, once again, I unclosed my eyes, the objects around me were visible. By a wild, sulphurous lustre, the origin of which I could not at first determine, I was enabled to see the extent and aspect of the prison.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我心绪纷乱，有好几个小时都是清醒的，但最终又睡死过去。再次醒来，我发现和上次一样，身边又放了一块面包、一罐子水。我正渴得唇焦舌燥呢，一口气就把罐子里的水喝干了。可能水里给下了药，刚一进肚，我就感到一阵不可抗拒的困倦袭来。我沉沉睡去，就像死了一样。我当然不知道自己睡了多久。眼睛再度睁开时，居然能看到周围的东西了。借着一线一时说不出从何而来的昏黄亮光，我终于看清了牢房的大小和形状。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In its size I had been greatly mistaken. The whole circuit of its walls did not exceed twenty-five yards. For some minutes this fact occasioned me a world of vain trouble; vain indeed -- for what could be of less importance, under the terrible circumstances which environed me, then the mere dimensions of my dungeon? But my soul took a wild interest in trifles, and I busied myself in endeavors to account for the error I had committed in my measurement. The truth at length flashed upon me. In my first attempt at exploration, I had counted fifty-two paces, up to the period when I fell: I must then have been within a pace or two of the fragment of serge; in fact, I had nearly performed the circuit of the vault. I then slept -- and, upon awaking, I must have returned upon my steps -- thus supposing the circuit nearly double what it actually was. My confusion of mind prevented me from observing that I began my tour with the wall to the left, and ended it with the wall to the right.</div>

<div class="line_en">I had been deceived, too, in respect to the shape of the enclosure. In feeling my way, I had found many angles, and thus deduced an idea of great irregularity; so potent is the effect of total darkness upon one arousing from lethargy or sleep! The angles were simply those of a few slight depressions, or niches, at odd intervals. The general shape of the prison was square. What I had taken for masonry seemed now to be iron, or some other metal, in huge plates, whose sutures or joints occasioned the depression. The entire surface of this metallic enclosure was rudely daubed in all the hideous and repulsive devices to which the charnel superstition of the monks has given rise. The figures of fiends in aspects of menace, with skeleton forms, and other more really fearful images, overspread and disfigured the walls. I observed that the outlines of these monstrosities were sufficiently distinct, but that the colors seemed faded and blurred, as if from the effects of a damp atmosphere. I now noticed the floor, too, which was of stone. In the centre yawned the circular pit from whose jaws I had escaped; but it was the only one in the dungeon.</div>

<div class="line_en">All this I saw indistinctly and by much effort -- for my personal condition had been greatly changed during slumber. I now lay upon my back, and at full length, on a species of low framework of wood. To this I was securely bound by a long strap resembling a surcingle. It passed in many convolutions about my limbs and body, leaving at liberty only my head, and my left arm to such extent, that I could, by dint of much exertion, supply myself with food from an earthen dish which lay by my side on the floor. I saw, to my horror, that the pitcher had been removed. I say, to my horror -- for I was consumed with intolerable thirst. This thirst it appeared to be the design of my persecutors to stimulate -- for the food in the dish was meat pungently seasoned.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一切，我看得不甚清楚，而且还很费劲，因为在昏睡之时，我的身体状况发生了很大变化。我现在是仰面朝天，直挺挺得躺在一个低矮的木架子上，身上牢牢地捆着教服腰带一样的皮绳子。皮绳绕着我的四肢和身体缠了一圈又一圈，只有头部可以自由活动，左手勉强伸出够到吃的。食物就在附近地板上的陶制盘子里。我惊恐地发现，水罐子不见了。我说惊恐，是因为我快渴死了。很明显，这种焦渴是迫害我的人有意为之，因为盘子里的食物是肉，散发出刺鼻的味道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Looking upward, I surveyed the ceiling of my prison. It was some thirty or forty feet overhead, and constructed much as the side walls. In one of its panels a very singular figure riveted my whole attention. It was the painted figure of Time as he is commonly represented, save that, in lieu of a scythe, he held what, at a casual glance, I supposed to be the pictured image of a huge pendulum, such as we see on antique clocks. There was something, however, in the appearance of this machine which caused me to regard it more attentively. While I gazed directly upward at it, (for its position was immediately over my own,) I fancied that I saw it in motion. In an instant afterward the fancy was confirmed. Its sweep was brief, and of course slow. I watched it for some minutes, somewhat in fear, but more in wonder. Wearied at length with observing its dull movement, I turned my eyes upon the other objects in the cell.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我审视着地牢的天花板。它距我大概三四十英尺，构造与四壁很是相仿。其中一块嵌板上的一个奇异人影，深深吸引了我。那是一幅彩色的时间老人的画像。它与一般画法并无二致。只不过，他手里握的不是一把镰刀。不经意地扫了一眼后，我还以为，那是一个我们在老式钟上见过的巨大钟摆。但这个钟摆外形上的奇特处，促使我多看了它几眼。当我直勾勾地仰望着它时（它的位置恰在我正上方），我觉得我看到它动了。片刻间，这个感觉就被证实了。它的摆动幅度不大，当然也很慢。我盯着它看了会儿，有几分害怕，更多的则是惊奇。直到看厌了它单调的摆动，我的眼睛才转向天花板上的其他东西。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It might have been half an hour, perhaps even an hour, (for I could take but imperfect note of time) before I again cast my eyes upward. What I then saw, confounded and amazed me. The sweep of the pendulum had increased in extent by nearly a yard. As a natural consequence, its velocity was also much greater. But what mainly disturbed me, was the idea that it had perceptibly descended. I now observed -- with what horror it is needless to say -- that its nether extremity was formed of a crescent of glittering steel, about a foot in length from horn to horn; the horns upward, and the under edge evidently as keen as that of a razor. Like a razor also, it seemed massy and heavy, tapering from the edge into a solid and broad structure above. It was appended to a weighty rod of brass, and the whole hissed as it swung through the air.</div>

<div class="line_en">I could no longer doubt the doom prepared for me by monkish ingenuity in torture. My cognizance of the pit had become known to the inquisitorial agents -- the pit, whose horrors had been destined for so bold a recusant as myself -- the pit, typical of hell, and regarded by rumor as the Ultima Thule of all their punishments. The plunge into this pit I had avoided by the merest of accidents, and I knew that surprise, or entrapment into torment, formed an important portion of all the grotesquerie of these dungeon deaths. Having failed to fall, it was no part of the demon plan to hurl me into the abyss; and thus (there being no alternative) a different and a milder destruction awaited me. Milder!

But it might have been long -- for I knew there were demons who took note of my swoon, and who could have arrested the vibration at pleasure. Upon my recovery, too, I felt very -- oh, inexpressibly -- sick and weak, as if through long inanition. Even amid the agonies of that period, the human nature craved food. With painful effort I outstretched my left arm as far as my bonds permitted, and took possession of the small remnant which had been spared me by the rats. As I put a portion of it within my lips, there rushed to my mind a half-formed thought of joy -- of hope. Yet what business had I with hope? It was, as I say, a half-formed thought -- man has many such, which are never completed. I felt that it was of joy -- of hope; but I felt also that it had perished in its formation.

It would fray the serge of my robe -- it would return and repeat its operations -- again -- and again. Notwithstanding its terrifically wide sweep, (some thirty feet or more,) and the hissing vigor of its descent, sufficient to sunder these very walls of iron, still the fraying of my robe would be all that, for several minutes, it would accomplish. And at this thought I paused. I dared not go farther than this reflection. I dwelt upon it with a pertinacity of attention -- as if, in so dwelling, I could arrest here the descent of the steel.

My eyes followed its outward or upward whirls with the eagerness of the most unmeaning despair; they closed themselves spasmodically at the descent, although death would have been a relief, oh, how unspeakable! Still I quivered in every nerve to think how slight a sinking of the machinery would precipitate that keen, glistening axe upon my bosom.

For the first time during many hours -- or perhaps days -- I thought. It now occurred to me, that the bandage, or surcingle, which enveloped me, was unique. I was tied by no separate cord. The first stroke of the razor-like crescent athwart any portion of the band, would so detach it that it might be unwound from my person by means of my left hand. But how fearful, in that case, the proximity of the steel! The result of the slightest struggle, how deadly! Was it likely, moreover, that the minions of the torturer had not foreseen and provided for this possibility? Was it probable that the bandage crossed my bosom in the track of the pendulum? Dreading to find my faint, and, as it seemed, my last hope frustrated, I so far elevated my head as to obtain a distinct view of my breast.

<div class="line_cn" title="脑袋还没在原来的位置摆正，就有一个想法电光石火般闪过心头。我只能说，这正是先前提到的那尚未成形的脱身念头的另一半。先前，当我把食物送到焦渴的唇边时，只有一半想法在脑海中飘飘忽忽地漾起。现在，整个想法都出来了，虽然微弱、隐约、模糊，但却完整。想到能绝处逢生，我马上满怀激情地着手干起来，都有点神经质了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For many hours the immediate vicinity of the low framework upon which I lay, had been literally swarming with rats. They were wild, bold, ravenous -- their red eyes glaring upon me as if they waited but for motionlessness on my part to make me their prey. "To what food," I thought, "have they been accustomed in the well?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几个小时以来，我躺的那个矮木架旁边，大批老鼠蜂拥而至，它们疯狂、猖獗而贪婪，血红的眼睛死死盯住我，似乎在专门等到我一动不动时扑上来吞吃我。“它们在陷坑里惯于吃什么？”我暗自思忖道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They had devoured, in spite of all my efforts to prevent them, all but a small remnant of the contents of the dish. I had fallen into an habitual see-saw, or wave of the hand about the platter; and, at length, the unconscious uniformity of the movement deprived it of effect. In their voracity, the vermin frequently fastened their sharp fangs in my fingers. With the particles of the oily and spicy viand which now remained, I thoroughly rubbed the bandage wherever I could reach it; then, raising my hand from the floor, I lay breathlessly still.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管我拼命驱逐，它们到底还是把盘子里的肉吃得仅省一点碎屑。我的手一直习惯性地挥舞着，想看住盘子里的食物，可是到后来，这种无意识的挥动再也不起任何作用了。可恶的群鼠在贪婪至极，尖利的牙齿常常咬着我的手指。肉真的所剩不多了。我把那点油乎乎香喷喷的碎末全都抹到皮绳上，凡是左手能触及的地方，我都涂上了。然后，我把手缩回来，屏住呼吸躺着，一动也不动。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At first, the ravenous animals were startled and terrified at the change -- at the cessation of movement. They shrank alarmedly back; many sought the well. But this was only for a moment. I had not counted in vain upon their voracity. Observing that I remained without motion, one or two of the boldest leaped upon the frame-work, and smelt at the surcingle. This seemed the signal for a general rush. Forth from the well they hurried in fresh troops. They clung to the wood -- they overran it, and leaped in hundreds upon my person. The measured movement of the pendulum disturbed them not at all. Avoiding its strokes, they busied themselves with the anointed bandage. They pressed -- they swarmed upon me in ever accumulating heaps. They writhed upon my throat; their cold lips sought my own; I was half stifled by their thronging pressure; disgust, for which the world has no name, swelled my bosom, and chilled, with a heavy clamminess, my heart. Yet one minute, and I felt that the struggle would be over. Plainly I perceived the loosening of the bandage. I knew that in more than one place it must be already severed. With a more than human resolution I lay still.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看到这一变化——看到我一动不动了，那些贪婪的老鼠起初是又惊又怕，纷纷惶恐地后退，不少老鼠都逃回陷坑去了。但这样的现象只持续了一会儿。我没有白白估计错它们的贪婪。看我照样一动不动，一二只最大胆的跳上了木架，在绳索上嗅来嗅去。这像是个总攻的信号。成群结队的老鼠，急急忙忙、冒冒失失地涌出陷坑，粘在木架上，跳上我的身体，简直是泛滥成灾。钟摆“喀嚓喀嚓”的摆动丝毫没造成干扰，它们一边躲闪着不让钟摆撞上，一边忙着啃噬涂满肉末的皮绳子。它们密密麻麻地挤压在我身上，在我脖子上扭来扭去，冰冷在嘴巴嗅着我的嘴唇。我差点被它们压得窒息而死。一种无法言喻的厌恶升腾而起，黏乎乎的，使我的心底生出萧瑟寒意。不过片刻之后，我就感到，战斗即将终结。我明显察觉到了皮绳的松动。我知道，老鼠咬断的地方，不止一处。我以超人的意志继续一动不动地躺着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Nor had I erred in my calculations -- nor had I endured in vain. I at length felt that I was free. The surcingle hung in ribands from my body. But the stroke of the pendulum already pressed upon my bosom. It had divided the serge of the robe. It had cut through the linen beneath. Twice again it swung, and a sharp sense of pain shot through every nerve. But the moment of escape had arrived. At a wave of my hand my deliverers hurried tumultuously away. With a steady movement -- cautious, sidelong, shrinking, and slow -- I slid from the embrace of the bandage and beyond the reach of the scimitar. For the moment, at least, I was free.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我没估算错——因为我没白白受苦。我终于有了自由的感觉。皮绳断了，就那么一截一截地披挂在我身上；但是钟摆的利刃也压向了胸膛。它划破了长袍的斜纹哔叽布，划破了里面的亚麻布衣衫。它又摆动两个来回。尖锐的疼痛传遍了每一根神经。不过，脱身的时刻也到来了。随着我大手一挥，一阵骚乱，释放我的大群老鼠匆匆逃离。我稳稳地行动了——小心而缓慢地往边上一缩，我滑脱了皮绳子的束缚，避开了弯刀的利刃。至少在这一刻，我是自由了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Free! -- and in the grasp of the Inquisition! I had scarcely stepped from my wooden bed of horror upon the stone floor of the prison, when the motion of the hellish machine ceased, and I beheld it drawn up, by some invisible force, through the ceiling. This was a lesson which I took desperately to heart. My every motion was undoubtedly watched. Free! -- I had but escaped death in one form of agony, to be delivered unto worse than death in some other. With that thought I rolled my eves nervously around on the barriers of iron that hemmed me in. Something unusual -- some change which, at first, I could not appreciate distinctly -- it was obvious, had taken place in the apartment. For many minutes of a dreamy and trembling abstraction, I busied myself in vain, unconnected conjecture. During this period, I became aware, for the first time, of the origin of the sulphurous light which illumined the cell. It proceeded from a fissure, about half an inch in width, extending entirely around the prison at the base of the walls, which thus appeared, and were completely separated from the floor. I endeavored, but of course in vain, to look through the aperture.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="自由！可我仍在宗教法庭的掌控之中！我刚从恐怖的木床上滑到石头地板上，那地狱般的玩意儿就停止了摆动。我看到某种无形的力量在把它往上拖，拖过天花板不见了。这个教训，我已铭刻在心。无疑，我的一举一动都受到了监视。自由！我只不过是逃脱了一种痛苦的死法，随后到来的，将是比死还难受的别一种折磨。想到这里，我神经质地转动眼珠，打量起囚禁我的几面铁壁。有不同寻常的变化发生——起初我没有清楚地注意到它——这变化很明显了，它已经在这间地牢里发生了！有好一阵子，我恍若置身梦中，颤抖不止，魂灵也脱壳而去。我乱七八糟地猜想着，却皆是枉然。这期间，我第一次意识到了照亮地牢的昏黄光线来自何方。它是从一道缝隙射出的。那缝隙宽约半英寸，沿着地牢的墙角延伸一周。如此看来，墙壁与地面是彻底分离的。事实正是这样。我拼命从那道缝隙向外看，当然这么做不过是徒劳而已。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Unreal! -- Even while I breathed there came to my nostrils the breath of the vapor of heated iron! A suffocating odor pervaded the prison! A deeper glow settled each moment in the eyes that glared at my agonies! A richer tint of crimson diffused itself over the pictured horrors of blood. I panted! I gasped for breath! There could be no doubt of the design of my tormentors -- oh! most unrelenting! oh! most demoniac of men! I shrank from the glowing metal to the centre of the cell. Amid the thought of the fiery destruction that impended, the idea of the coolness of the well came over my soul like balm. I rushed to its deadly brink. I threw my straining vision below. The glare from the enkindled roof illumined its inmost recesses. Yet, for a wild moment, did my spirit refuse to comprehend the meaning of what I saw. At length it forced -- it wrestled its way into my soul -- it burned itself in upon my shuddering reason. Oh! for a voice to speak! -- oh! horror! -- oh! any horror but this! With a shriek, I rushed from the margin, and buried my face in my hands -- weeping bitterly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我刚放弃这一企图，立刻发现牢房起了不可思议的神秘变化。我先前已观察过，墙上的那些鬼怪图轮廓虽然相当清晰，但色彩似乎模糊了。可眼下，色彩即刻间却呈现出惊人的变化，而且越来越光辉夺目。这使得那些妖魔鬼怪的画图更其可怕，就算神经没我脆弱的人，也会吓得两股战战。先前从没看到过那些鬼怪有眼睛，可现在，一双双魔眼从四面八方瞪着我，目光中还流溢出疯狂而可怕的欢快，闪出火焰般可怕的光芒，我无法迫使自己相信那火是虚幻的。虚幻！——在呼吸之间，已有铁板烧热的气息扑进鼻孔！牢房里弥漫着令人窒息的味道！那些盯着我受煎熬的魔眼一闪一闪的，也越来越亮了！深红的颜色越来越浓烈，在那些血淋淋的恐怖画图上漫射。我气喘吁吁！我难以呼吸！毫无疑问，这是那帮折磨我的家伙设好的阴谋。哦，冷酷的恶魔！为躲开炽热的铁壁，我只得朝地牢中央退缩。想到即将被活活烤死，陷坑的凉爽倒成了精神抚慰剂。我迫不及待地冲到那致命的坑边，瞪圆了双眼往下看。燃烧的屋顶发出的亮光，照彻了坑内的角角落落。我有一刻是癫狂的。我的心灵拒绝领悟眼见的事实。但最后，它还是硬闯进了我的内心——在我发抖的理智上，烙下了深深的印记。哦，不可言传！哦，恐怖！哦，登峰造极的恐怖！我尖叫着逃离坑沿，悲痛地掩面而泣。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As I arose from the attempt, the mystery of the alteration in the chamber broke at once upon my understanding. I have observed that, although the outlines of the figures upon the walls were sufficiently distinct, yet the colors seemed blurred and indefinite. These colors had now assumed, and were momentarily assuming, a startling and most intense brilliancy, that gave to the spectral and fiendish portraitures an aspect that might have thrilled even firmer nerves than my own. Demon eyes, of a wild and ghastly vivacity, glared upon me in a thousand directions, where none had been visible before, and gleamed with the lurid lustre of a fire that I could not force my imagination to regard as unreal.</div>

<div class="line_en">Fool! might I have not known that into the pit it was the object of the burning iron to urge me? Could I resist its glow? or if even that, could I withstand its pressure? And now, flatter and flatter grew the lozenge, with a rapidity that left me no time for contemplation. Its centre, and of course, its greatest width, came just over the yawning gulf. I shrank back -- but the closing walls pressed me resistlessly onward. At length for my seared and writhing body there was no longer an inch of foothold on the firm floor of the prison. I struggled no more, but the agony of my soul found vent in one loud, long, and final scream of despair. I felt that I tottered upon the brink -- I averted my eyes -- There was a discordant hum of human voices! There was a loud blast as of many trumpets! There was a harsh grating as of a thousand thunders! The fiery walls rushed back! An outstretched arm caught my own as I fell, fainting, into the abyss. It was that of General Lasalle. The French army had entered Toledo. The Inquisition was in the hands of its enemies.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="白痴！我难道不知道，火烧铁壁就是为了把我逼入陷坑？难道我抗得住铁壁的炽热？难道我经得起它的压力？此时，菱形变得更扁了，速度之快，根本容不得我有片刻的思考余地。菱形的中心，当然，也就是它最宽的地方，已横在了张着血盆大口的深渊上。我退缩着——但丝丝逼近的铁壁，不可抗拒地推着我前进。最后，我的身体烤焦了，它扭动着，翻腾着，可地牢坚实的地板上，已无我的立锥之地。我不再挣扎。我最后响亮、悠长、绝望地尖叫了一声，为痛苦的灵魂寻到了发泄的出口。我感觉到自己在陷坑边缘摇摇欲坠——我移开了目光——忽然，我听到了一阵嘈杂的人声，听到了一阵嘹亮的声音，像是无数号角的奏鸣。我还听到了似乎是雷霆万钧的刺耳的声音！炽热的墙壁“刷”地一下恢复了原状。正当我晕乎乎地快要跌入深渊之际，一只手臂伸来，一把抓住了我的胳膊。那是拉萨尔将军的手。法国军队已开进托莱多城。宗教法庭沦陷敌手。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The heat rapidly increased, and once again I looked up, shuddering as with a fit of the ague. There had been a second change in the cell -- and now the change was obviously in the form. As before, it was in vain that I at first endeavored to appreciate or understand what was taking place. But not long was I left in doubt. The Inquisitorial vengeance had been hurried by my two-fold escape, and there was to be no more dallying with the King of Terrors. The room had been square. I saw that two of its iron angles were now acute -- two, consequently, obtuse. The fearful difference quickly increased with a low rumbling or moaning sound. In an instant the apartment had shifted its form into that of a lozenge. But the alteration stopped not here -- I neither hoped nor desired it to stop. I could have clasped the red walls to my bosom as a garment of eternal peace. "Death," I said, "any death but that of the pit!"</div>
