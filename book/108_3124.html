<div class="line_en">As soon as the young man thundered into the passenger seat of the Saab with a large sandwich in his hand, Ove obviously wished he hadn't asked for Jimmy's help with this. Things are not improved by Jimmy aimlessly shuffling off to "check a few leads" as soon as they enter the shop.</div>

<div class="line_en">If you want something done you have to do it yourself, as usual, Ove confirms to himself as he steers his steps alone towards the sales assistant. And not until Ove roars, "Have you been frontally lobotomized or what?!" to the young man who's trying to show him the shop's range of portable computers does Jimmy come hurrying to his aid. And then it's not Ove but rather the shop assistant who needs to be aided.</div>

<div class="line_en">Broadly speaking there are two kinds of people. Those who understand how extremely useful white cables can be, and those who don't. Jimmy is the first of these. He loves white cables. And white telephones. And white computer monitors with fruit on the back. That's more or less the sum of what Ove has absorbed during the car journey into town, when Jimmy natters on excitedly about the sorts of things every rational person ought to be so insuperably interested in, until Ove at last sinks into a sort of deeply meditative state of mind, in which the overweight young man's babbling turns to a dull hissing in his ears.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ove doesn't quite know what it is, but it looks like a white electrical plug of some sort and it feels like the sort of thing he could throw very hard at the sales assistant if the need arises.

This is so frequent that one could possibly name a syndrome after him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ove stands quietly in the hall, poking his house keys against the calluses on one of his palms. Patrick comes limping along on his crutches in pursuit of the eight-year-old. Apparently he's been given the evening's most thankless task: that of convincing his daughter that it's more fun sitting there in a dress, eating cake with a lot of boring grown-ups, than staying in her room listening to pop music and downloading apps onto her new iPad. Ove stays in the hall with his jacket on and stares emptily at the floor for what must be almost ten minutes.</div>

<div class="line_en">He walks up towards the parking area with the cat. Checks all the signposts by giving them a good kick. Tugs at the garage doors. Makes a detour over the guest parking and then comes back. Checks the trash room. As they come back between the houses alongside Ove's toolshed, Ove sees something moving down by the last house on Parvaneh and Patrick's side of the road. At first Ove thinks it's one of the party guests, but soon he sees that the figure is moving by the shed belonging to the dark house of that recycling family. They, as far as Ove knows, are still in Thailand. He squints into the gloom to be sure that the shadows are not deceiving him, and for a few seconds he actually doesn't see anything. But then, just as he's ready to admit that his eyesight is not what it used to be, the figure reappears. And behind him, another two. And then he hears the unmistakable sound of someone tapping with a hammer at a window that's covered in insulation tape. Which is how one minimizes the noise when the glass shatters. Ove knows exactly what it sounds like; he learned how to do it on the railways when they had to knock out broken train windows without cutting their fingers.</div>

<div class="line_en">When there's a stabbing feeling in his breast he thinks at first that one of them has managed to attack him from behind and thump a fist into his back. But then there's another stab, from inside. Worse than ever, as if someone were skewering him from the scalp down, methodically working a sword all the way through his body until it comes out through the soles of his feet. Ove gasps for air but there's no air to be had. He falls in the middle of a stride, tumbles with his full weight into the snow. Perceives the dulled pain of his cheek scraping against the ice, and feels how something seems to be squeezing the insides of his chest in a big, merciless fist. Like an aluminum can being crushed in the hand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当胸口传来刺痛的时候，他起初以为是其中一个黑影偷袭得逞，从背后挥了他一拳。然而刺痛再次袭来，就像有人用剑扎透了他的头皮，然后有条不紊地贯穿他的全身，从脚底穿出。欧维张口喘气，但是已经没有空气可以呼吸。他在中途摔倒在地，全身的重量一齐瘫倒在雪地里。神志模糊中，他感觉到脸颊滑到冰粒上的钝痛，感觉到胸口像有一只无情的巨拳在搅动，就像在掌心攥压一个铝罐头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He sees one of them take a couple of steps towards him, and he hears one of them shouting something. Ove increases his pace and charges at them like a human battering ram. He has time to think that he should have brought something from the toolshed to fight with, but now it's too late. From the corner of his eye he notices one of the figures swinging something long and narrow in one fist, so Ove decides he has to hit that bastard first.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ove hears the running steps of the burglars in the snow, and realizes that they are fleeing. He doesn't know how many seconds pass, but the pain in his head, like a long line of fluorescent tubes exploding, is unbearable. He wants to cry out but there's no oxygen in his lungs. All he hears is Parvaneh's remote voice through the deafening sound of pulsating blood in his ears. Perceives the tottering steps when she stumbles and slips through the snow, her disproportionate body on those tiny feet. The last thing Ove has time to think before everything goes dark is that he has to make her promise that she won't let the ambulance drive down between the houses.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维听见雪地上传来窃贼的脚步声，知道他们正逃之夭夭。他不知道过去了多少时间。但脑中的疼痛，像玻璃和钢铁碎片交织的雨中一长串灯泡一个接一个爆裂般难以忍受。他想呐喊，但是胸口没有空气，他只听见帕尔瓦娜的声音透过耳际阵阵的血脉声隐隐传来，感知到她急促的脚步在雪地上跌跌撞撞一步一滑，她不成比例的身躯牵动着那对小脚。在一片漆黑之前，欧维最后的念头是一定要她保证不让救护车开到房子之间来。">查看中文翻译</div>
