<div class="line_en">It was a wide room, the whole width of the house. It had a low beamed ceiling and brown plaster walls decked out with strips of Chinese embroidery and Chinese and Japanese prints in grained wood frames. There were low bookshelves, there was a thick pinkish Chinese rug in which a gopher could have spent a week without showing his nose above the nap. There were floor cushions, bits of odd silk tossed around, as if whoever lived there had to have a piece he could reach out and thumb. There was a broad low divan of old rose tapestry. It had a wad of clothes on it, including lilac-colored silk underwear. There was a big carved lamp on a pedestal, two other standing lamps with jade-green shades and long tassels. There was a black desk with carved gargoyles at the corners and behind it a yellow satin cushion on a polished black chair with carved arms and back. The room contained an odd assortment of odors, of which the most emphatic at the moment seemed to be the pungent aftermath of cordite and the sickish aroma of ether.</div>

<div class="line_en">She had a beautiful body, small, lithe, compact, firm, rounded. Her skin in the lamplight had the shimmering luster of a pearl. Her legs didn't quite have the raffish grace of Mrs. Regan's legs, but they were very nice. I looked her over without either embarrassment or ruttishness. As a naked girl she was not there in that room at all. She was just a dope. To me she was always just a dope.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的身体很美：玲珑，柔软，紧致，结实，丰满。灯光下，她的皮肤焕发出珍珠般的光泽。她的腿不像里根太太的腿那样妖冶魅人，却也非常漂亮。我上下打量着她，既不觉尴尬也没起色心。在这屋里的根本算不得一个裸女。她只是个白痴。在我眼里，她从来只是个白痴。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On a sort of low dais at one end of the room there was a high-backed teakwood chair in which Miss Carmen Sternwood was sitting on a fringed orange shawl. She was sitting very straight, with her hands on the arms of the chair, her knees close together, her body stiffly erect in the pose of an Egyptian goddess, her chin level, her small bright teeth shining between her parted lips. Her eyes were wide open. The dark slate color of the iris had devoured the pupil. They were mad eyes. She seemed to be unconscious, but she didn't have the pose of unconsciousness. She looked as if, in her mind, she was doing something very important and making a fine job of it. Out of her mouth came a tinny chuckling noise which didn't change her expression or even move her lips.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="房间一头，一处类似矮平台的地方有张高背柚木椅，卡门·斯特恩伍德小姐端坐其上，身下垫着一块流苏镶边的橘色披巾。她坐得笔挺，手放在椅子扶手上，膝盖并拢，僵直的身姿犹如埃及女神，下巴收平，小巧洁白的牙齿在微启的双唇间闪闪发亮。她双目圆睁。眼球幽深的暗蓝色已然吞没瞳孔。那是一双疯子的眼睛。她好像丧失了知觉，但失去知觉的人又不会是那种坐姿。看起来她似乎正想象自己在做什么非常重要的事，而且大获成功。她嘴里发出一串尖细的笑声，可笑归笑，她的表情毫无变化，连嘴唇也纹丝不动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She was wearing a pair of long jade earrings. They were nice earrings and had probably cost a couple of hundred dollars. She wasn't wearing anything else.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她戴着一对狭长的玉耳环。那是对精致的耳环，也许价值好几百块。除此之外，她全身上下一丝不挂。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I stopped looking at her and looked at Geiger. He was on his back on the floor, beyond the fringe of the Chinese rug, in front of a thing that looked like a totem pole. It had a profile like an eagle and its wide round eye was a camera lens. The lens was aimed at the naked girl in the chair. There was a blackened flash bulb clipped to the side of the totem pole. Geiger was wearing Chinese slippers with thick felt soles, and his legs were in black satin pajamas and the upper part of him wore a Chinese embroidered coat, the front of which was mostly blood. His glass eye shone brightly up at me and was by far the most life-like thing about him. At a glance none of the three shots I heard had missed. He was very dead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我不看她了，把目光移向盖革。他仰天躺在地毯流苏旁的地板上，身前是一根图腾柱一样的东西。它外形像一只鹰，又大又圆的眼睛是照相机镜头。镜头正对着椅子上那个赤条条的姑娘。柱子一侧夹着一个发黑的闪光灯泡。盖革穿着带厚毛毡鞋底的中式便鞋，腿上是黑缎睡裤，上身一件中式刺绣外套，前襟沾满了鲜血。他那颗玻璃眼珠亮晶晶地对着我发光，目前看来，这是他身上最有生机的东西了。草草一看，那三枪都没有打偏。他死得很透。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The flash bulb was the sheet lightning I had seen. The crazy scream was the doped and naked girl's reaction to it. The three shots had been somebody else's idea of how the proceedings might be given a new twist. The idea of the lad who had gone down the back steps and slammed into a car and raced away. I could see merit in his point of view.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我之前看到的那道闪电便源于这闪光灯泡。疯癫的尖叫声是这赤条条的傻姑娘看到亮光后的反应。三声枪响则是其他人的主意，想让事情有个出人意料的转折。就是那个走下后门台阶，砰地关上车门逃走的家伙。我可以借他的视角看清真相。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A couple of fragile gold-veined glasses rested on a red lacquer tray on the end of the black desk, beside a potbellied flagon of brown liquid. I took the stopper out and sniffed at it. It smelled of ether and something else, possibly laudanum. I had never tried the mixture but it seemed to go pretty well with the Geiger menage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那张黑色桌子一头的红漆托盘上，摆着两只精巧的金丝玻璃杯，旁边是盛着棕色液体的大肚酒瓶。我摘掉瓶塞，嗅了嗅那液体。闻着像乙醚混合了别的什么，可能是鸦片酊。我从来没这样混合过，不过这瓶东西倒是同盖革家很搭。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I listened to the rain hitting the roof and the north windows. Beyond was no other sound, no cars, no siren, just the rain beating. I went over to the divan and peeled off my trench coat and pawed through the girl's clothes. There was a pale green rough wool dress of the pull-on type, with half sleeves. I thought I might be able to handle it. I decided to pass up her underclothes, not from feelings of delicacy, but because I couldn't see myself putting her pants on and snapping her brassiere. I took the dress over to the teak chair on the dais. Miss Sternwood smelled of ether also, at a distance of several feet. The tinny chuckling noise was still coming from her and a little froth oozed down her chin. I slapped her face. She blinked and stopped chuckling. I slapped her again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我听着雨点打在屋顶和北窗上。除此没有别的声响，没有汽车声，没有警笛声，只有雨点滴答滴答响个不停。我走到卧榻前，脱掉雨衣，乱翻着那女孩的衣物。有条淡绿色的中袖粗羊毛套衫。我寻思着这件衣服我倒是可以帮她穿。内衣还是算了。倒不是故作矜持，只是看不得自己给她穿内裤扣胸罩。我把套衫拿到平台上的柚木椅子前。斯特恩伍德小姐身上也散发着乙醚味，在几英尺开外都闻得到。她还在细声细气地咯咯傻笑，嘴角的一丝涎沫顺下巴淌着。我扇了她两个耳光。她眨眨眼，不笑了。我又扇了她两下。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We took a little walk. Part of the time her earrings banged against my chest and part of the time we did the splits in unison, like adagio dancers. We walked over to Geiger's body and back. I had her look at him. She thought he was cute. She giggled and tried to tell me so, but she just bubbled. I walked her over to the divan and spread her out on it. She hiccuped twice, giggled a little and went to sleep. I stuffed her belongings into my pockets and went over behind the totem pole thing. The camera was there all right, set inside it, but there was no plate-holder in the camera. I looked around on the floor, thinking he might have got it out before he was shot. No plateholder. I took hold of his limp chilling hand and rolled him a little. No plateholder. I didn't like this development.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们走了几步。一半时间她的耳环重重砸在我的胸口上，一半时间我俩一齐迈步，犹如一对“慢板”[1]舞者。我们走到盖革的尸体前，再返回。我让她看了看他。她觉得他很可爱，傻笑起来，很想告诉我这点，却只是咯咯笑个不停。我领着她走向卧榻，让她四肢伸展仰躺在上面。她打了两个嗝，笑了几声，睡着了。我把她的东西塞进口袋，走到那根图腾柱后面。里面确实装了照相机，但机器里找不到暗盒。我在地上四顾找了找，心想他被枪杀前没准把它拿了出来。找不到暗盒。我握住他松垮冰凉的手，稍稍翻动他的身子。仍旧找不到暗盒。这样的事态发展我不喜欢。【注：[1]表演古典芭蕾双人舞时，女伴在男伴托扶下表演的各种缓慢优美的舞蹈动作。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She peered at me, her slaty eyes as empty as holes in a mask. "Gugutoterell," she said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她凝视着我，暗蓝色的眼睛空洞得好似面具上的孔眼。“咕咕嘟得哩。”她说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I slapped her around a little more. She didn't mind the slaps. They didn't bring her out of it. I set to work with the dress. She didn't mind that either. She let me hold her arms up and she spread her fingers out wide, as if that was cute. I got her hands through the sleeves, pulled the dress down over her back, and stood her up. She fell into my arms giggling. I set her back in the chair and got her stockings and shoes on her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我又掌掴了她几下。她满不在乎。挨了打，她并没有回过神来。我开始给她穿衣服。对此她也不放在心上。她由着我抬起她的手臂，还把手指张得很开，好像这样有多可爱似的。我抓着她的手穿进袖管，帮她把背后的衣服往下拉，再扶她起来。她痴笑着跌进我的怀里。我将她抱回椅子上，为她穿好鞋袜。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I went into a hall at the back of the room and investigated the house. There was a bathroom on the right and a locked door, a kitchen at the back. The kitchen window had been jimmied. The screen was gone and the place where the hook had pulled out showed on the sill. The back door was unlocked. I left it unlocked and looked into a bedroom on the left side of the hall. It was neat, fussy, womanish. The bed had a flounced cover. There was perfume on the triple-mirrored dressing table, beside a handkerchief, some loose money, a man's brushes, a keyholder. A man's clothes were in the closet and a man's slippers under the flounced edge of the bed cover. Mr. Geiger's room. I took the keyholder back to the living room and went through the desk. There was a locked steel box in the deep drawer. I used one of the keys on it. There was nothing in it but a blue leather book with an index and a lot of writing in code, in the same slanting printing that had written to General Sternwood. I put the notebook in my pocket, wiped the steel box where I had touched it, locked the desk up, pocketed the keys, turned the gas logs off in the fireplace, wrapped myself in my coat and tried to rouse Miss Sternwood. It couldn't be done. I crammed her vagabond hat on her head and swathed her in her coat and carried her out to her car. I went back and put all the lights out and shut the front door, dug her keys out of her bag and started the Packard. We went off down the hill without lights. It was less than ten minutes' drive to Alta Brea Crescent. Carmen spent them snoring and breathing ether in my face. I couldn't keep her head off my shoulder. It was all I could do to keep it out of my lap.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我走进屋子后面的过道，搜查起这幢房子来。右边有间浴室，后面是一扇锁着的门和一间厨房。厨房的窗户被人撬开了。纱窗不见了，看得到窗台上有个地方的挂钩被扯掉了。后门没锁。我由它保持原样，去过道左边的卧室里看了看。那卧室整洁、花哨、女里女气的。床上铺着镶荷叶边的罩子。三面镜子的梳妆台上放着香水，旁边是手帕、一点零钱、男士用的头刷和一串钥匙。壁橱里是男式衣服，床罩的荷叶边下方是男式拖鞋。是盖革先生的房间。我拿着钥匙串回到起居室，翻检起书桌来。抽屉很深，里面有只上锁的钢盒。我用一把钥匙打开了盒子。盒子里没什么东西，只有一本带索引的皮面本子，里面写了很多密码，正是那种倾斜的印刷体字，跟之前斯特恩伍德将军收到的一模一样。我把笔记本放进口袋，擦干净钢盒上我碰过的位置，锁好桌子，收起钥匙，关掉壁炉里的圆木形煤气炉，穿上雨衣，想叫醒斯特恩伍德小姐。可办不到。我拿起那顶毡帽硬戴到她头上，给她裹好雨衣，把她抱去了门外她的车里。我回到屋里，灭掉所有的灯，关上门，从她提包深处掏出钥匙，发动了那辆帕卡德。下山时我们没开车灯。不消十分钟就到了阿尔塔·布雷亚新月街道。卡门睡了一路，打着呼噜，朝我脸上喷着乙醚味的鼻息。我没法把她的脑袋从我肩上挪开。我能做的，最多就是不让它贴着我的大腿了。">查看中文翻译</div>
