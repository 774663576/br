<div class="line_en">"And so nice of Annie Moffat not to forget her promise. A whole fortnight of fun will be regularly splendid," replied Jo, looking like a windmill as she folded skirts with her long arms.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“安妮·莫法特没有忘记自己的诺言，这实在太棒了。足足两个星期让你尽情快活，那有多么痛快，”乔一面搭过话儿，一面用长胳膊把几件裙子折起来，形象颇像个风车。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I wish you were all going, but as you can't, I shall keep my adventures to tell you when I come back. I'm sure it's the least I can do when you have been so kind, lending me things and helping me get ready," said Meg, glancing round the room at the very simple outfit, which seemed nearly perfect in their eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我真希望大家都能去，既然不能，那就等我回来再跟你们讲遇到的奇闻趣事。你们对我这么好，把东西借给我，帮我收拾行装，我一定尽此绵力，”梅格说着环视房间，眼光落在行装上面。这套行装虽然十分简单，但在她们眼中却几乎十全十美。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It will look nice over my new muslin skirt, and the sash will set it off beautifully. I wish I hadn't smashed my coral bracelet, for you might have had it," said Jo, who loved to give and lend, but whose possessions were usually too dilapidated to be of much use. There is a lovely old-fashioned pearl set in the treasure chest, but Mother said real flowers were the prettiest ornament for a young girl, and Laurie promised to send me all I want," replied Meg. "Now, let me see, there's my new gray walking suit, just curl up the feather in my hat, Beth, then my poplin for Sunday and the small party, it looks heavy for spring, doesn't it? The violet silk would be so nice. Oh, dear!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这比起我的新薄纱裙子还要好看，衬上腰带就更加漂亮了。我真后悔我的珊瑚手镯给砸坏了，不然你便可以戴上它，”乔说。她生性豪爽大方，只是她的财物大都破旧不堪，派不上什么用场“宝箱里有一套漂亮的旧式珍珠首饰，但妈妈说鲜花才是年轻姑娘最美丽的饰物，而劳里答应把我要的全都送来，”梅格回答，”来，让我看看，这是我的新灰色旅行衣——把羽毛卷进我的帽子里，贝思——那是星期天和小型晚会穿的府绸裙子——春天穿显得沉了点，对吧？如果是紫罗兰色的丝绸裙子就好了；唉！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What did Mother give you out of the treasure box?" asked Amy, who had not been present at the opening of a certain cedar chest in which Mrs. March kept a few relics of past splendor, as gifts for her girls when the proper time came.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“妈妈从那只宝箱里拿出什么给你？”艾美问。马奇太太有个杉木箱子，里头装着几件曾经辉煌一时的旧物，准备在适当的时候送给四个女儿。那天打开箱子时，艾美恰好不在场，故有此一问。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Never mind, you've got the tarlaton for the big party, and you always look like an angel in white," said Amy, brooding over the little store of finery in which her soul delighted.</div>

<div class="line_en">"It isn't low-necked, and it doesn't sweep enough, but it will have to do. My blue housedress looks so well, turned and freshly trimmed, that I feel as if I'd got a new one. My silk sacque isn't a bit the fashion, and my bonnet doesn't look like Sallie's. I didn't like to say anything, but I was sadly disappointed in my umbrella. I told Mother black with a white handle, but she forgot and bought a green one with a yellowish handle. It's strong and neat, so I ought not to complain, but I know I shall feel ashamed of it beside Annie's silk one with a gold top," sighed Meg, surveying the little umbrella with great disfavor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可它领口太高，拖曳感也不够，但也只好这样应付了。我那件蓝色家居服倒是挺好，翻了新，并刚刚镶了饰边，和新的一样。我的丝绸外衣一点都不时髦，帽子也不像莎莉那顶；我原不想多说，但我对自己的伞失望极了。我原叫妈妈买一把白柄子的黑伞，她却忘了，带回一把黄柄子的绿桑这把伞结实雅致，因此我不该抱怨，但如果把它跟艾美那把金顶丝绸伞摆在一起，我就要羞死了。”梅格边叹息边极不满意地审视着那把小桑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I won't be so silly, or hurt Marmee's feelings, when she took so much pains to get my things. It's a nonsensical notion of mine, and I'm not going to give up to it. My silk stockings and two pairs of new gloves are my comfort. You are a dear to lend me yours, Jo. I feel so rich and sort of elegant, with two new pairs, and the old ones cleaned up for common." And Meg took a refreshing peep at her glove box.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不会这么傻，妈妈为我花钱已经很不容易了，我不想伤她的心。这只是我的荒唐想法罢了，我不会不分好歹的。幸好我的丝袜和两对新手套可以出出场面。你把自己的借给我，真是好妹妹，乔。我有两对新的，旧的也洗得干干净净，我觉得已经十分气派了。”梅格又朝她放手套的箱子瞄了一眼。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Annie Moffat has blue and pink bows on her nightcaps. Would you put some on mine?" she asked, as Beth brought up a pile of snowy muslins, fresh from Hannah's hands.</div>

<div class="line_en">"So I did! Well, I am happy, and I won't fret, but it does seem as if the more one gets the more one wants, doesn't it? There now, the trays are ready, and everything in but my ball dress, which I shall leave for Mother to pack," said Meg, cheering up, as she glanced from the half-filled trunk to the many times pressed and mended white tarlaton, which she called her 'ball dress' with an important air.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我是这样说过！哦，我是很满足，我也不会为此烦恼，不过似乎人得到的越多，野心也就越大，对不？噢，行了，行李装好了，一切齐备，单剩我的舞会礼服了，那要等妈妈来收拾，”梅格说着，眼光从装得半满的行李箱落到熨补过多次、被她郑重其事地称为‘舞会礼服’的白色塔拉丹薄纱裙上，心情愉快起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I wonder if I shall ever be happy enough to have real lace on my clothes and bows on my caps?" said Meg impatiently.</div>

<div class="line_en">The next day was fine, and Meg departed in style for a fortnight of novelty and pleasure. Mrs. March had consented to the visit rather reluctantly, fearing that Margaret would come back more discontented than she went. But she begged so hard, and Sallie had promised to take good care of her, and a little pleasure seemed so delightful after a winter of irksome work that the mother yielded, and the daughter went to take her first taste of fashionable life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天天气不错，梅格体面堂皇地辞别大家，准备体验十四天新奇快乐的生活。马奇太太一开始不同意这次出行，担心玛格丽特回来后会比去时更添一层不满。但梅格纠缠不休，莎莉也答应会好好照顾她，而且，干了一个冬天的烦闷工作后，到外面玩玩也是一大乐事，母亲便答应下来，让女儿去一尝上流社会的生活滋味。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Moffats were very fashionable, and simple Meg was rather daunted, at first, by the splendor of the house and the elegance of its occupants. But they were kindly people, in spite of the frivolous life they led, and soon put their guest at her ease. Perhaps Meg felt, without understanding why, that they were not particularly cultivated or intelligent people, and that all their gilding could not quite conceal the ordinary material of which they were made. It certainly was agreeable to fare sumptuously, drive in a fine carriage, wear her best frock every day, and do nothing but enjoy herself. It suited her exactly, and soon she began to imitate the manners and conversation of those about her, to put on little airs and graces, use French phrases, crimp her hair, take in her dresses, and talk about the fashions as well as she could. The more she saw of Annie Moffat's pretty things, the more she envied her and sighed to be rich. Home now looked bare and dismal as she thought of it, work grew harder than ever, and she felt that she was a very destitute and much-injured girl, in spite of the new gloves and silk stockings.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莫法特一家确实非常时髦。楼宇富丽堂皇，主人举止优雅，单纯的梅格一开始吃惊不校不过，尽管莫法特一家生活奢华放纵，但他们都是善良的人家，很快便使客人轻松下来。不知为什么，梅格隐隐觉得他们并非特别有教养，也并非特别聪明，虽然他们衣着华丽，其实内中也不过俗人一个而已。生活奢侈，乘坐豪华辇车，每天穿上漂亮衣服，除享乐之外一无所事，这种生活自然十分惬意。这正是梅格所思慕的生活。她很快便模仿身边那些人的言谈举止，摆点小架子，装点腔势，说话时搭上一句半句法语，把头发卷曲，把衣服弄窄，并学着评论流行服式。安妮·莫法特的漂亮东西她见得越多，就越是羡慕不已，自叹不如。如今家在她的心目中已经变得空无一物、沉闷无趣，工作变得比任何时候都要艰苦。她觉得自己是个一贫如洗、受到严重伤害的姑娘，即使有两对新手套和丝袜也无济于事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When the evening for the small party came, she found that the poplin wouldn't do at all, for the other girls were putting on thin dresses and making themselves very fine indeed. So out came the tarlatan, looking older, limper, and shabbier than ever beside Sallie's crisp new one. Meg saw the girls glance at it and then at one another, and her cheeks began to burn, for with all her gentleness she was very proud. No one said a word about it, but Sallie offered to dress her hair, and Annie to tie her sash, and Belle, the engaged sister, praised her white arms. But in their kindness Meg saw only pity for her poverty, and her heart felt very heavy as she stood by herself, while the others laughed, chattered, and flew about like gauzy butterflies. The hard, bitter feeling was getting pretty bad, when the maid brought in a box of flowers. Before she could speak, Annie had the cover off, and all were exclaiming at the lovely roses, heath, and fern within.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="临到‘小型晚会’那天晚上，她发现那件府绸裙子根本应付不了场面，因为其他姑娘们全都穿着薄薄的裙子，个个打扮得美若天仙；于是塔拉丹出动了，但跟莎莉簇新的裙子一比，立即相形失色，显得残旧不堪、寒酸落伍。梅格看到姑娘们扫了它一眼后，都互相交换个眼色，双颊顿时烧得通红。她虽然性格温柔，但自尊心极强。大家对此并没有说什么，不过莎莉主动提出跟她梳理头发，安妮帮她扎腰带，贝儿，那位订了婚的姐姐，则称赞她洁白的双臂。虽然大家全出于好意，但梅格看到的只是对贫穷的怜悯而已。她独自站立一旁，心情十分沉重，而姑娘们则又说又笑，像披着薄纱的蝴蝶一样到处跑来跑去。正当梅格心酸难受之际，女佣人突然送进来一箱鲜花。未等她说话，安妮已把盖子打开，众人随即发出一阵惊呼，原来里头装的全是绚丽的玫瑰、杜鹃和绿蕨。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She had not much time for repining, however, for the three young girls were busily employed in 'having a good time'. They shopped, walked, rode, and called all day, went to theaters and operas or frolicked at home in the evening, for Annie had many friends and knew how to entertain them. Her older sisters were very fine young ladies, and one was engaged, which was extremely interesting and romantic, Meg thought. Mr. Moffat was a fat, jolly old gentleman, who knew her father, and Mrs. Moffat, a fat, jolly old lady, who took as great a fancy to Meg as her daughter had done. Everyone petted her, and 'Daisey', as they called her, was in a fair way to have her head turned.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，她并没有多少时间来烦恼，因为三位年轻姑娘忙于打发‘快乐时光’。她们整天逛商店、散步、骑马、探访朋友，晚上则上剧院或留在家里嬉戏，因为安妮结交了不少朋友，熟谙待客之道。她的几个姐姐都是十分漂亮的年轻女子，一个已经订婚，而订婚是极为有趣而浪漫的，梅格想。莫法特先生是个体胖、快活的老绅士，认识她的父亲；莫法特太太，一位体胖、快活的老太太，跟自己的女儿一样十分喜欢梅格。一家人全都宠爱她，“黛茜”，如他们所称，被惯得有点头脑发热。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh, indeed!" said Annie with a funny look, as Meg slipped the note into her pocket as a sort of talisman against envy, vanity, and false pride, for the few loving words had done her good, and the flowers cheered her up by their beauty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，原来如此！”安妮怪模怪样地说了一句。梅格把字条塞进口袋，把它当作一种抵御妒忌、虚荣和伪自尊的护身符。里头寥寥数语，一片慈爱真情，梅格看后精神为之一振，而美丽动人的鲜花也使她心情好转起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What fun! Who are they from? Didn't know you had a lover," cried the girls, fluttering about Meg in a high state of curiosity and surprise.</div>

<div class="line_en">Feeling almost happy again, she laid by a few ferns and roses for herself, and quickly made up the rest in dainty bouquets for the breasts, hair, or skirts of her friends, offering them so prettily that Clara, the elder sister, told her she was 'the sweetest little thing she ever saw', and they looked quite charmed with her small attention. Somehow the kind act finished her despondency, and when all the rest went to show themselves to Mrs. Moffat, she saw a happy, bright-eyed face in the mirror, as she laid her ferns against her rippling hair and fastened the roses in the dress that didn't strike her as so very shabby now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="梅格几乎恢复了愉快的心情，她拈出几支绿蕨和玫瑰留给自己，随即将其余的分成几把精美的花束，分给朋友们点缀在胸前、头发和衣裙上。她做得既愉快又得体，大姐卡莱拉不禁称她为“她所见到的最甜美的小东西”，众人也十分欣赏她的小心意。这一善举把她的沮丧心情一驱而散。其他人都跑到莫法特太太跟前展览去了，她独个儿把几支绿蕨插在自己的鬈发上，又把几朵玫瑰在裙子上别好，这时裙子在她心目中变得没有那么难看了，临镜一照，看到了一张喜气洋洋双目明亮的脸孔。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She enjoyed herself very much that evening, for she danced to her heart's content. Everyone was very kind, and she had three compliments. Annie made her sing, and some one said she had a remarkably fine voice. Major Lincoln asked who 'the fresh little girl with the beautiful eyes' was, and Mr. Moffat insisted on dancing with her because she 'didn't dawdle, but had some spring in her', as he gracefully expressed it. So altogether she had a very nice time, till she overheard a bit of conversation, which disturbed her extremely. She was sitting just inside the conservatory, waiting for her partner to bring her an ice, when she heard a voice ask on the other side of the flowery wall…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天晚上她尽兴起舞，玩得十分开心；大家都非常友善，她还被人奉承了三次。安妮让她唱歌，有人称赞她声音十分甜美。林肯少校问“那位水灵灵的美目小姑娘”是谁，莫法特先生坚持要和她跳舞，因为她“不躲懒、舞步轻快有力”，他很有风度地说。这一切都使她的心情十分愉快，不料，她后来不经意听到了几句闲话，情绪顿时一落千丈。那时她正坐在温室里面，等舞伴给她带冰块过来，突然听到花墙的另一面传来一个声音问道——">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Here Meg's partner appeared, to find her looking much flushed and rather agitated. She was proud, and her pride was useful just then, for it helped her hide her mortification, anger, and disgust at what she had just heard. For, innocent and unsuspicious as she was, she could not help understanding the gossip of her friends. She tried to forget it, but could not, and kept repeating to herself, "Mrs. M. has made her plans," "that fib about her mamma," and "dowdy tarlaton," till she was ready to cry and rush home to tell her troubles and ask for advice. As that was impossible, she did her best to seem gay, and being rather excited, she succeeded so well that no one dreamed what an effort she was making. She was very glad when it was all over and she was quiet in her bed, where she could think and wonder and fume till her head ached and her hot cheeks were cooled by a few natural tears. Those foolish, yet well meant words, had opened a new world to Meg, and much disturbed the peace of the old one in which till now she had lived as happily as a child. Her innocent friendship with Laurie was spoiled by the silly speeches she had overheard. Her faith in her mother was a little shaken by the worldly plans attributed to her by Mrs. Moffat, who judged others by herself, and the sensible resolution to be contented with the simple wardrobe which suited a poor man's daughter was weakened by the unnecessary pity of girls who thought a shabby dress one of the greatest calamities under heaven.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“走着瞧吧。我要特意为她邀请小劳伦斯，那我就有好戏看了。”这时梅格的舞伴走回来，看到她脸红耳赤，情绪相当激动。她确实是个傲气的姑娘，也幸亏如此，她才忍住了没有发作，虽然她对刚才听到的闲话感到又羞又气、十分厌恶；因为无论她多么天真无邪，也不至于不明白这种闲话的意思。这些话挥之不去，一直在她耳边纠缠：什么“马奇太太早有计划”，“撒了个小谎”，“邋遢的塔拉丹”，等等。她真想大哭一场，冲回家去倾诉苦恼，寻求忠告。无奈这是不可能的事，她只得强装笑脸。由于心情激动，她一点也没有露出破绽，没有人想象得出她心里正在翻江倒海。终于盼到人散灯灭，她静静躺在床上，千思百想，愤愤不平，一直弄得脑袋生痛，又洒下几滴清泪，凉丝丝地落在烧得赤热的脸颊上。那些没有恶意的无聊话为梅格开辟了一个新天地，把她一直以来孩子般生活着的纯真、平静的旧天地搅得涟漪阵阵。她和劳里天真无邪的友谊被无意听来的废话蒙上了一层阴影；她对妈妈的信心也因以小人之心度人的莫法特太太‘早有计划’几个字而产生了一点动摇；她原以为自己是穷人家的女儿，衣着简朴乃是无可非议的事情，所以一向知足，岂料这帮姑娘看到旧裙子就如同看到普天之下最大的灾难一样，滥发同情之心，她不禁也对自己的信念产生了一丝怀疑。">查看中文翻译</div>

They crimped and curled her hair, they polished her neck and arms with some fragrant powder, touched her lips with coralline salve to make them redder, and Hortense would have added 'a soupcon of rouge', if Meg had not rebelled. They laced her into a sky-blue dress, which was so tight she could hardly breathe and so low in the neck that modest Meg blushed at herself in the mirror. A set of silver filagree was added, bracelets, necklace, brooch, and even earrings, for Hortense tied them on with a bit of pink silk which did not show. A cluster of tea-rose buds at the bosom, and a ruche, reconciled Meg to the display of her pretty, white shoulders, and a pair of high-heeled silk boots satisfied the last wish of her heart. A lace handkerchief, a plumy fan, and a bouquet in a shoulder holder finished her off, and Miss Belle surveyed her with the satisfaction of a little girl with a newly dressed doll.</div>

"Don't be troubled, Meg, poverty seldom daunts a sincere lover. Some of the best and most honored women I know were poor girls, but so love-worthy that they were not allowed to be old maids. Leave these things to time. Make this home happy, so that you may be fit for homes of your own, if they are offered you, and contented here if they are not. One thing remember, my girls. Mother is always ready to be your confidant, Father to be your friend, and both of us hope and trust that our daughters, whether married or single, will be the pride and comfort of our lives."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“说得好，乔，宁愿做快乐的老处女，也不做伤心的太太或不正经的女孩子，四处乱跑找丈夫，”马奇太太用坚定的口吻说，”不要烦恼，梅格，一个情到深处的恋人是不会轻易被贫穷吓倒的。我所知道的一些最优秀、最高贵的女士原来也是出身寒门，但爱神并没有遗忘这些可爱的女士们。耐心等待吧；让我们的家充满幸福，这样，当你们自己有一个家的时候，才可以承担起责任，如果没有，便在这里知足常乐地过一生。好孩子，记住：妈妈随时随刻都是你们倾诉闺中心事的知己，爸爸是你们的朋友；无论人们结婚还是独身，我们都希望自己的女儿能够成为我们生活中的骄傲和安慰。”">查看中文翻译</div>
