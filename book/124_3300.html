<div class="line_en">I screamed to wake up my parents, and they burst into the room, but there was nothing they could do to dim the supernovae exploding inside my brain, an endless chain of intracranial firecrackers that made me think that I was once and for all going, and I told myself -- as I've told myself before -- that the body shuts down when the pain gets too bad, that consciousness is temporary, that this will pass.

<div class="line_en">I woke up in the ICU. I could tell I was in the ICU because I didn't have my own room, and because there was so much beeping, and because I was alone: They don't let your family stay with you 24/7 in the ICU at Children's because it's an infection risk. There was wailing down the hall. Somebody's kid had died. I was alone. I hit the red call button.</div>

<div class="line_en">Whereupon I started to feel pretty tired again. But I woke up a bit when my parents came in, crying and kissing my face repeatedly, and I reached up for them and tried to squeeze, but my everything hurt when I squeezed, and Mom and Dad told me that I did not have a brain tumor, but that my headache was caused by poor oxygenation, which was caused by my lungs swimming in fluid, a liter and a half (!!!!) of which had been successfully drained from my chest, which was why I might feel a slight discomfort in my side, where there was, hey look at that, a tube that went from my chest into a plastic bladder half full of liquid that for all the world resembled my dad's favorite amber ale. Mom told me I was going to go home, that I really was, that I would just have to get this drained every now and again and get back on the BiPAP, this nighttime machine that forces air in and out of my crap lungs. But I'd had a total body PET scan on the first night in the hospital, they told me, and the news was good: no tumor growth. No new tumors. My shoulder pain had been lack-of-oxygen pain. Heart-working-too-hard pain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说完这句话我又开始觉得非常疲倦。但爸妈进来时我稍微清醒了点，他们哭着反复吻我的脸，我伸手抱他们，想使劲搂紧一点，但我一使劲浑身上下都疼。爸妈告诉我，我没得脑癌，头疼是由供氧不足引起的，而供氧不足是因为我的肺又浸泡在液体里了。医生从我胸腔成功地抽出了一升半（！！！）液体，这就是为什么我可能会觉得肋骨处有点儿不舒服，那儿，“嘿瞧瞧那儿”，有一根管子从我的胸腔出来通到一个塑料囊，里面装了一半液体，不管怎么看都像爸爸最喜欢的琥珀色麦芽啤酒。妈妈告诉我，我很快就能回家，绝不是骗我，我只需要时不时把这些液体排出来，还有，晚上要使用一种BiPAP呼吸机，它能强迫空气从我的垃圾肺进进出出。他们还说，我来医院的第一晚就做了个全身PET扫描，结果很好：肿瘤没有扩大，也没发现新的癌细胞。我的肩膀疼是缺氧引起的，心脏负担过重导致的疼痛。">查看中文翻译</div>

On Wednesday, two minimally supervised medical students removed my chest tube, which felt like getting stabbed in reverse and generally didn't go very well, so they decided I'd have to stay until Thursday. I was beginning to think that I was the subject of some existentialist experiment in permanently delayed gratification when Dr. Maria showed up on Friday morning, sniffed around me for a minute, and told me I was good to go.</div>

<div class="line_en">While we're on the topic of old Will's insufficiencies, your writing about young Hazel reminds me of the Bard's Fifty-fifth sonnet, which of course begins, "Not marble, nor the gilded monuments / Of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme; / But you shall shine more bright in these contents / Than unswept stone, besmear'd with sluttish time." (Off topic, but: What a slut time is. She screws everybody.) It's a fine poem but a deceitful one: We do indeed remember Shakespeare's powerful rhyme, but what do we remember about the person it commemorates? Nothing. We're pretty sure he was male; everything else is guesswork. Shakespeare told us precious little of the man whom he entombed in his linguistic sarcophagus. (Witness also that when we talk about literature, we do so in the present tense. When we speak of the dead, we are not so kind.) You do not immortalize the lost by writing about them. Language buries, but does not resurrect. (Full disclosure: I am not the first to make this observation. cf, the MacLeish poem "Not Marble, Nor the Gilded Monuments," which contains the heroic line "I shall say you will die and none will remember you.")</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="既然我们说到了莎老头的不足，你信里写到年轻的海蓁，让我想起这位诗人著名的十四行诗中的第五十五首。自然，开篇是这样的：没有云石或王公们金的墓碑/能够和我这些强劲的诗比寿/你将永远闪耀于这些诗篇里/远胜过那被时光涂脏的石头。”（时光真是个荡妇，它把每个人都搞了。）这首诗优美，但却不诚实：我们的确记得莎士比亚强劲的诗句，但诗里所说的那个人我们又记得些什么？什么也不记得。我们非常肯定他是男性，其他的一切就全属猜测。莎士比亚用语言做棺柩掩埋了此人，关于此人他向我们透露得极少。另外，请看，我们谈论文学时用现在时态，但谈到死去的人，我们就不那么宽和了。为逝者写作，不能令斯人不朽。语言只能埋葬逝者，却不能起死回生。（大曝光：我不是第一个发表此番言论的人。参看麦克利什 [4] 的诗作《没有云石或王公们金的墓碑》，其中有这样一句英雄体诗行：我要说你将死去，无人铭记你。）【注：[4] 阿奇博尔德·麦克利什（Archibald MacLeish，1892—1982），美国著名诗人和剧作家。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I am in receipt of your electronic mail dated the 14th of April and duly impressed by the Shakespearean complexity of your tragedy. Everyone in this tale has a rock-solid hamartia: hers, that she is so sick; yours, that you are so well. Were she better or you sicker, then the stars would not be so terribly crossed, but it is the nature of stars to cross, and never was Shakespeare more wrong than when he had Cassius note, "The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars / But in ourselves." Easy enough to say when you're a Roman nobleman (or Shakespeare!), but there is no shortage of fault to be found amid our stars.</div>
