<div class="line_en">Hot Pie ate even better; he was where he belonged, in the kitchens, a round stone building with a domed roof that was a world unto itself. Arya took her meals at a trestle table in the undercroft with Weese and his other charges, but sometimes she would be chosen to help fetch their food, and she and Hot Pie could steal a moment to talk. He could never remember that she was now Weasel and kept calling her Arry, even though he knew she was a girl. Once he tried to slip her a hot apple tart, but he made such a clumsy job of it that two of the cooks saw. They took the tart away and beat him with a big wooden spoon.</div>

<div class="line_en">Whatever names Harren the Black had meant to give his towers were long forgotten. They were called the Tower of Dread, the Widow's Tower, the Wailing Tower, the Tower of Ghosts, and Kingspyre Tower. Arya slept in a shallow niche in the cavernous vaults beneath the Wailing Tower, on a bed of straw. She had water to wash in whenever she liked, a chunk of soap. The work was hard, but no harder than walking miles every day. Weasel did not need to find worms and bugs to eat, as Arry had; there was bread every day, and barley stews with bits of carrot and turnip, and once a fortnight even a bite of meat.</div>

<div class="line_en">Weese used Arya to run messages, draw water, and fetch food, and sometimes to serve at table in the Barracks Hall above the armory, where the men-at-arms took their meals. But most of her work was cleaning. The ground floor of the Wailing Tower was given over to storerooms and granaries, and two floors above housed part of the garrison, but the upper stories had not been occupied for eighty years. Now Lord Tywin had commanded that they be made fit for habitation again. There were floors to be scrubbed, grime to be washed off windows, broken chairs and rotted beds to be carried off. The topmost story was infested with nests of the huge black bats that House Whent had used for its sigil, and there were rats in the cellars as well… and ghosts, some said, the spirits of Harren the Black and his sons.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="威斯安排艾莉亚做些奔走送信，打水，拿食物之类的工作，有时也叫她去军械库上方的兵营大厅侍奉士兵们餐饮。但她主要的工作是打扫清洗。号哭塔的底层如今被当做储藏室和粮仓，再上面两层住着一部分守城军士，但更高的楼层已经空置了八十年。泰温大人下令，要把它们收拾得适合人居。这样，就有无数的地板需要清洗，无数的窗户需要擦拭，无数的破椅烂床需要修理。顶层是河安家族家徽上那种黑蝠的巢穴，地下室则居住着好多老鼠…据说还闹鬼，黑心赫伦和他儿子们的鬼魂就在那里出没。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harrenhal was vast, much of it far gone in decay. Lady Whent had held the castle as bannerman to House Tully, but she'd used only the lower thirds of two of the five towers, and let the rest go to ruin. Now she was fled, and the small household she'd left could not begin to tend the needs of all the knights, lords, and highborn prisoners Lord Tywin had brought, so the Lannisters must forage for servants as well as for plunder and provender. The talk was that Lord Tywin planned to restore Harrenhal to glory, and make it his new seat once the war was done.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="赫伦堡巨大宽广，许多地方几近腐朽凋敝。河安伯爵夫人曾以徒利家族封臣的身份掌管城堡，但她只动用了五座塔里的两座，且只用下面三层，任由其他部分毁坏崩溃。如今她避战而逃，留下的一小群仆人自然无法照顾泰温大人麾下的大批骑士、领主和贵族囚犯，因此兰尼斯特家除了打家劫舍，搜刮钱粮，还得多抓人手来充当仆役。据说泰温大人打算恢复赫伦堡往日的荣耀，一旦战争结束便将其作为新的居城。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Gendry had been sent to the forge; Arya seldom saw him. As for those she served with, she did not even want to know their names. That only made it hurt worse when they died. Most of them were older than she was and content to let her alone.</div>

<div class="line_en">Arya thought that was stupid. Harren and his sons had died in Kingspyre Tower, that was why it had that name, so why should they cross the yard to haunt her? The Wailing Tower only wailed when the wind blew from the north, and that was just the sound the air made blowing through the cracks in the stones where they had fissured from the heat. If there were ghosts in Harrenhal, they never troubled her. It was the living men she feared, Weese and Ser Gregor Clegane and Lord Tywin Lannister himself, who kept his apartments in Kingspyre Tower, still the tallest and mightiest of all, though lopsided beneath the weight of the slagged stone that made it look like some giant half-melted black candle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="艾莉亚觉得这种说法很笨。赫伦父子死在焚王塔里——那座塔正是因此而得名——他们干嘛大老远穿过庭院来吓她呢？号哭塔每当北风刮来时才会号哭，那不过是因为空气吹过石头缝隙，这些石头当年曾因高热而裂开。总而言之，即便赫伦堡闹鬼，它们也从没来骚扰过她。她觉得活人比死人可怕多了，她害怕威斯和格雷果·克里冈爵士，更害怕住在焚王塔里的泰温·兰尼斯特公爵。那座塔尽管历经当年的烈火，在融化变形的岩石重压下倾向一侧，看上去活像一根巨大而半融的黑蜡烛，但仍然是最高最雄伟的塔楼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She wondered what Lord Tywin would do if she marched up to him and confessed to being Arya Stark, but she knew she'd never get near enough to talk to him, and anyhow he'd never believe her if she did, and afterward Weese would beat her bloody.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她不知道如果直接跑到泰温公爵面前，坦白自己是艾莉亚·史塔克，他会怎么做，但她知道自己根本没有近身的机会，更别提说话了，而且不管怎样，即使她说了，他也决不会相信，事后威斯还会狠狠揍她。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In his own small strutting way, Weese was nearly as scary as Ser Gregor. The Mountain swatted men like flies, but most of the time he did not even seem to know the fly was there. Weese always knew you were there, and what you were doing, and sometimes what you were thinking. He would hit at the slightest provocation, and he had a dog who was near as bad as he was, an ugly spotted bitch that smelled worse than any dog Arya had ever known. Once she saw him set the dog on a latrine boy who'd annoyed him. She tore a big chunk out of the boy's calf while Weese laughed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="威斯虽然地位低贱，又极自负，却差不多跟格雷果爵士一样可怕。魔山杀人就跟拍苍蝇一样随便，但多半时间他并不在乎苍蝇。可威斯总是知道你在那儿，知道你在干嘛，甚至知道你在想什么，哪怕露出一丝半点反抗之意，他就要你好看。他有一条丑陋的斑点母狗，几乎跟他一样坏，而且气味比艾莉亚见过的任何一条狗都难闻。有一次，一个扫厕所的男孩把他惹火了，他便放狗对付男孩。母狗撕下男孩小腿上一大块肉，威斯则哈哈大笑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On the road Arya had felt like a sheep, but Harrenbal turned her into a mouse. She was grey as a mouse in her scratchy wool shift, and like a mouse she kept to the crannies and crevices and dark holes of the castle, scurrying out of the way of the mighty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在来时的路上，艾莉亚感觉自己像头绵羊，到了赫伦堡之后，她觉得自己变成了老鼠。她不但穿着凌乱的羊毛裙，像老鼠一样灰仆仆的，也始终像老鼠一样在城堡的裂缝与黑洞之间求生存，随时得留心闪避，以免冒犯有权有势的大人们。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It took him only three days to earn the place of honor in her nightly prayers. "Weese," she would whisper, first of all. "Dunsen, Chiswyck, Polliver, Raff the Sweetling. The Tickler and the Hound. Ser Gregor, Ser Amory, Ser Ilyn, Ser Meryn, King Joffrey, Queen Cersei." If she let herself forget even one of them, how would she ever find him again to kill him?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="仅仅花了三天，他就在她的夜晚祷词中赢得一席之地。“威斯，”她把他放在荣誉的首席，“邓森，奇斯威克，波利佛，‘甜嘴’拉夫。记事本和猎狗。格雷果爵士，亚摩利爵士，伊林爵士，马林爵士，乔佛里国王，瑟曦太后。”她不能允许自己忘记其中一人，否则将来要怎么去找他们报仇，把他们杀掉呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sometimes she thought they were all mice within those thick walls, even the knights and the great lords. The size of the castle made even Gregor Clegane seem small. Harrenhal covered thrice as much ground as Winterfell, and its buildings were so much larger they could scarcely be compared. Its stables housed a thousand horses, its godswood covered twenty acres, its kitchens were as large as Winterfell's Great Hall, and its own great hall, grandly named the Hall of a Hundred Hearths even though it only had thirty and some (Arya had tried to count them, twice, but she came up with thirty-three once and thirty-five the other time) was so cavernous that Lord Tywin could have feasted his entire host, though he never did. Walls, doors, halls, steps, everything was built to an inhuman scale that made Arya remember the stories Old Nan used to tell of the giants who lived beyond the Wall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有时候她觉得大家都是困在厚厚围墙里的老鼠，即使骑士和领主们也一样，因为这城堡的规模让格雷果·克里冈都显得渺小。赫伦堡占地是临冬城的三倍，建筑物的体积更有天渊之别。它的马厩能容纳一千匹马，它的神木林足有二十亩，它的厨房仿若临冬城的大厅，而它本身的大厅则堂皇地冠以“百炉厅”的名号，虽然有些言过其实（艾莉亚曾经努力数过，但一次结果是三十三，另一次是三十五），但的确宽阔空旷，足够泰温公爵宴请整个军团，虽然他从没这么干过。不论墙壁，门窗，厅堂，阶梯，所有的一切都只能以巨大来形容，简直不像是给人类建造的，这让艾莉亚不禁想起老奶妈的故事里生活在长城之外的巨人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">King Robert's brothers Stannis and Renly had joined the fighting, she heard. "And both of them kings now," Weese said. "Realm's got more kings than a castle's got rats." Even Lannister men questioned how long Joffrey would hold the Iron Throne. "The lad's got no army but them gold cloaks, and he's ruled by a eunuch, a dwarf, and a woman," she heard a lordling mutter in his cups. "What good will the likes of them be if it comes to battle?" There was always talk of Beric Dondarrion. A fat archer once said the Bloody Mummers had slain him, but the others only laughed. "Lorch killed the man at Rushing Falls, and the Mountain's slain him twice. Got me a silver stag says he don't stay dead this time neither."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她还听说劳勃国王的两个弟弟史坦尼斯和蓝礼都加入了战事。“他俩自立为王，”威斯道，“这年头，国王比城堡里的老鼠还多。”如今，就连兰尼斯特的人也开始怀疑乔佛里到底可以在铁王座上坐多久。“这小鬼除了那群没用的金袍子之外根本没有一兵一卒，帮他管事的还是太监、侏儒和女人！”她听见某个小领主在杯盏间自言自语，“真正打起仗来，这些个家伙管什么用？”不时有人谈及贝里·唐德利恩。一个胖胖的弓箭手说他已被“血戏班”杀了，但其他人只是哈哈大笑。“他被洛奇在急流瀑前杀过一次，被魔山宰过两次。我赌一个银鹿，这次他也死得不安分。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And as lords and ladies never notice the little grey mice under their feet, Arya heard all sorts of secrets just by keeping her ears open as she went about her duties. Pretty Pia from the buttery was a slut who was working her way through every knight in the castle. The wife of the gaoler was with child, but the real father was either Ser Alyn Stackspear or a singer called Whitesmile Wat. Lord Lefford made mock of ghosts at table, but always kept a candle burning by his bed. Ser Dunaver's squire Jodge could not hold his water when he slept. The cooks despised Ser Harys Swyft and spit in all his food. Once she even overheard Maester Tothmure's serving girl confiding to her brother about some message that said Joffrey was a bastard and not the rightful king at all. "Lord Tywin told him to burn the letter and never speak such filth again," the girl whispered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="老爷和夫人们从不留意脚底的小灰鼠，于是艾莉亚在奔走东西执行任务期间，只需竖起耳朵，便能听到各种秘密。比如储藏室里那“小美人”皮雅其实是个荡妇，跟城堡里每个骑士几乎都有一腿；狱卒的老婆怀了孕，但孩子真正的爹不是埃林·斯脱克皮爵士，就是名叫“白色微笑”渥特的歌手；莱佛德伯爵在餐桌上对闹鬼之说大肆嘲笑，睡觉时却总在床边点一根蜡烛；杜纳佛爵士的侍从乔吉睡觉时会尿床；厨子们都鄙视哈瑞斯·史威佛爵士，并往他的食物里啐唾沫。有一次，她甚至偷听到托斯谬学士的侍女向哥哥诉说，乔佛里原来是个私生子，根本不是正统的国王。“泰温大人告诉师傅把信烧掉，再不准提起这肮脏事，”女孩低声道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Arya did not know who Bloody Mummers were until a fortnight later, when the queerest company of men she'd ever seen arrived at Harrenhal. Beneath the standard of a black goat with bloody horns rode copper men with bells in their braids; lancers astride striped black-and-white horses; bowmen with powdered cheeks; squat hairy men with shaggy shields; brown-skinned men in feathered cloaks; a wispy fool in green-and-pink motley; swordsmen with fantastic forked beards dyed green and purple and silver; spearmen with colored scars that covered their cheeks; a slender man in septon's robes, a fatherly one in maester's grey, and a sickly one whose leather cloak was fringed with long blond hair.</div>

<div class="line_en">No one ransomed the northmen, though. One fat lordling haunted the kitchens, Hot Pie told her, always looking for a morsel. His mustache was so bushy that it covered his mouth, and the clasp that held his cloak was a silver-and-sapphire trident. He belonged to Lord Tywin, but the fierce, bearded young man who liked to walk the battlements alone in a black cloak patterned with white suns had been taken by some hedge knight who meant to get rich off him. Sansa would have known who he was, and the fat one too, but Arya had never taken much interest in titles and sigils. Whenever Septa Mordane had gone on about the history of this house and that house, she was inclined to drift and dream and wonder when the lesson would be done.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then one morning she spied three women in the cowled grey robes of the silent sisters loading a corpse into their wagon. The body was sewn into a cloak of the finest silk, decorated with a battle-axe sigil. When Arya asked who it was, one of the guards told her that Lord Cerwyn had died.

For days and days Arya tried to work out how she might steal past the door guards to see him. If he knew her, he would be honor bound to help her. A lord would have gold for a certainty, they all did; perhaps he would pay some of Lord Tywin's own sellswords to take her to Riverrun.

<div class="line_en">Though ravens came and went every day, Lord Tywin himself spent most of his days behind closed doors with his war council. Arya caught glimpses of him, but always from afar -- once walking the walls in the company of three maesters and the fat captive with the bushy mustache, once riding out with his lords bannermen to visit the encampments, but most often standing in an arch of the covered gallery watching men at practice in the yard below. He stood with his hands locked together on the gold pommel of his longsword. They said Lord Tywin loved gold most of all; he even shit gold, she heard one squire jest. The Lannister lord was strong-looking for an old man, with stiff golden whiskers and a bald head. There was something in his face that reminded Arya of her own father, even though they looked nothing alike. He has a lord's face, that's all, she told herself. She remembered hearing her lady mother tell Father to put on his lord's face and go deal with some matter. Father had laughed at that. She could not imagine Lord Tywin ever laughing at anything.</div>

<div class="line_en">After that it was back to scrubbing and scurrying and listening at doors. Lord Tywin would soon march on Riverrun, she heard. Or he would drive south to Highgarden, no one would ever expect that. No, he must defend King's Landing, Stannis was the greatest threat. He'd sent Gregor Clegane and Vargo Hoat to destroy Roose Bolton and remove the dagger from his back. He'd sent ravens to the Eyrie, he meant to wed the Lady Lysa Arryn and win the Vale. He'd bought a ton of silver to forge magic swords that would slay the Stark wargs. He was writing Lady Stark to make a peace, the Kingslayer would soon be freed.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, be that as it may, she's not much to look at, but Eggon's been drinking and gets to touching her, and might be I did a little touching meself, and Raff's telling young Stilwood that he ought t' drag the girl upstairs and make hisself a man, giving the lad courage as it were. Finally Joss reaches up under her skirt, and she shrieks and drops her flagon and goes running off to the kitchen. Well, it would have ended right there, only what does the old fool do but he goes to Ser and asks him to make us leave the girl alone, him being an anointed knight and all such.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Ser Gregor, he wasn't paying no mind to none of our fun, but now he looks, you know how he does, and he commands that the girl be brought before him. Now the old man has to drag her out of the kitchen, and no one to blame but hisself. Ser looks her over and says, 'So this is the whore you're so concerned for' and this besotted old fool says, 'My Layna's no whore, ser' right to Gregor's face. Ser, he never blinks, just says, 'She is now' tosses the old man another silver, rips the dress off the wench, and takes her right there on the table in front of her da, her flopping and wiggling like a rabbit and making these noises. The look on the old man's face, I laughed so hard ale was coming out me nose. Then this boy hears the noise, the son I figure, and comes rushing up from the cellar, so Raff has to stick a dirk in his belly. By then Ser's done, so he goes back to his drinking and we all have a turn. Tobbot, you know how he is, he flops her over and goes in the back way. The girl was done fighting by the time I had her, maybe she'd decided she liked it after all, though to tell the truth I wouldn't have minded a little wiggling. And now here's the best bit… when it's all done, Ser tells the old man that he wants his change. The girl wasn't worth a silver, he says… and damned if that old man didn't fetch a fistful of coppers, beg mlord's pardon, and thank him for the custom!"</div>

<div class="line_en">Two nights later, he sent her to the Barracks Hall to serve at table. She was carrying a flagon of wine and pouring when she glimpsed Jaqen H'ghar at his trencher across the aisle. Chewing her lip, Arya glanced around warily to make certain Weese was not in sight. Fear cuts deeper than swords, she told herself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两天之后，威斯派她去兵营大厅侍奉晚餐。她拿酒壶帮兵士们倒酒时，一眼瞥见贾昆·赫加尔就在走道对面，就着托盘用餐。艾莉亚咬着嘴唇，小心翼翼地四处张望了一下，以确定威斯不在附近。恐惧比利剑更伤人，她告诉自己。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The men all roared, none louder than Chiswyck himself, who laughed so hard at his own story that snot dribbled from his nose down into his scraggy grey beard. Arya stood in the shadows of the stairwell and watched him. She crept back down to the cellars without saying a word. When Weese found that she hadn't asked about the clothes, he yanked down her breeches and caned her until blood ran down her thighs, but Arya closed her eyes and thought of all the sayings Syrio had taught her, so she scarcely felt it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="众人轰然狂笑，其中声音最大的就是奇斯威克自己，他似乎很满意自己的故事，连鼻涕都滴了下来，淌进乱糟糟的灰胡子里。艾莉亚站在楼梯间的阴影中，注视着他，一声不吭。最后，她蹑手蹑脚地回到地下室，威斯发现她没有询问衣服的事，便扒下她的裤子，用藤条鞭打，打得她大腿鲜血淋漓。艾莉亚闭紧眼睛，默念着西利欧教她的口诀，忘却了所有痛楚。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She took a step, and another, and with each she felt less a mouse. She worked her way down the bench, filling wine cups. Rorge sat to Jaqen's right, deep drunk, but he took no note of her. Arya leaned close and whispered, "Chiswyck," right in Jaqen's ear. The Lorathi gave no sign that he had heard.</div>
