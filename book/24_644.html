<div class="line_en">"There are many things we have had to hide from you, as we hid ourselves for half our stay on Earth. Some of you, I know, thought that concealment unnecessary. You are accustomed to our presence: you can no longer imagine how your ancestors would have reacted to us. But at least you can understand the purpose of our concealment, and know that we had a reason for what we did.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Because we banned nuclear weapons and all the other deadly toys you were accumulating in your armouries, the danger of physical annihilation was removed. You thought that was the only danger. We wanted you to believe that, but it was never true. The greatest danger that confronted you was of a different character altogether -- and it did not concern your race alone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当时，你们军火库中的核武器和其他致命玩意儿越来越多，我们首先摧毁了所有武器，消除了你们自相残杀的可能。你们以为那是唯一的危险，我们也有意让你们那样想。事实并非如此，最大的危险完全是另一种类型，也不是地球上独有的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Many worlds have come to the crossroads of nuclear power, have avoided disaster, have gone on to build peaceful and happy civilizations -- and have then been utterly destroyed by forces of which they knew nothing. In the twentieth century, you first began to tamper seriously with those forces. That was why it became necessary to act.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“其他很多星球都和你们一样顺利地走过核能危机，避开灾难，建立起和平幸福的文明，但最终还是失败了，被一种未知的力量彻底毁灭了。从二十世纪开始，你们就在玩弄这种神秘力量，因此必须马上制止。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"All through that century, the human race was drawing slowly nearer to the abyss -- never even suspecting its existence. Across that abyss, there is only one bridge. Few races, unaided, have ever found it. Some have turned back while there was still time, avoiding both the danger and the achievement. Their worlds have become Elysian islands of effortless content, playing no further part in the story of the universe. That would never have been your fate -- or your fortune. Your race was too vital for that. It would have plunged into ruin and taken others with it, for you would never have found the bridge.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“整个二十世纪，人类慢慢走近了一个不可知的无底深渊，只有一座桥可以过去，但各个星球的人很少能独自找到那座桥。他们中有些因为还有时间就打道回府了，危险避开了，发展也从此变得不可能了，他们的世界虽然富足，但再也无法在宇宙的历史中发挥作用了。你们的命运不是这样，或者说你们没有这样幸运，那种生活不属于你们，如果找不到那座桥，你们就会带着其他种族一同毁灭。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yet your mystics, though they were lost in their own delusions, had seen part of the truth. There are powers of the mind, and powers beyond the mind, which your science could never have brought within its framework without shattering it entirely. All down the ages there have been countless reports of strange phenomena -- poltergeists, telepathy, precognition -- which you had named but never explained. At first Science ignored them, even denied their existence, despite the testimony of five thousand years. But they exist, and, if it is to be complete, any theory of the universe must account for them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“神秘主义者也发现了一部分真理。你们的科学不可能接受智力、超智力这些客观存在的现象，否则，你们现有的科学体系就要全盘崩溃。后来许多年里出现了很多关于鬼怪、心灵感应、先知先觉等特异现象的报道，但你们只给这些现象取了个名字，没有作任何解释。最初，所有科学研究都不顾它们已经存在了五千年这个事实，盲目忽视甚至刻意否认它们的存在。但它们毕竟是真实存在的，任何一个完善的理论都必须能解释这些现象。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"In the centuries before our coming, your scientists uncovered the secrets of the physical world and led you from the energy of steam to the energy of the atom. You had put superstition behind you: Science was the only real religion of mankind. It was the gift of the western minority to the remainder of mankind, and it had destroyed all other faiths. Those that still existed when we came were already dying. Science, it was felt, could explain everything: there were no forces which did not come within its scope, no events for which it could not ultimately account. The origin of the universe might be forever unknown, but all that had happened after obeyed the laws of physics.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“在我们来到地球前的几个世纪，你们的科学家已经揭开了物质世界的一些秘密，从蒸汽时代发展到了原子时代，迷信废除了，科学成了人类惟一的宗教，这是西方少数人对世界的贡献；我们来的时候，宗教信仰摧毁了，虽然还有几种宗教，但早已名存实亡。人们相信科学可以解释一切，没有任何力量能超越科学的范畴，没有任何事科学解释不了；宇宙的起源也许永远无人知晓，但后来的一切都按照物理学原理在发展。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"To understand, you must go back into the past and recover much that your ancestors would have found familiar, but which you have forgotten -- which, in fact, we deliberately helped you to forget. For all our sojourn here has been based on a vast deception, a concealment of truth which you were not ready to face.</div>

<div class="line_en">"And so we came -- we were sent -- to Earth. We interrupted your development on every cultural level, but in particular we checked all serious work on paranormal phenomena. I am well aware of the fact that we have also inhibited, by the contrast between our civilizations, all other forms of creative achievement as well. But that was a secondary effect, and it is of no Importance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“所以我们就被派来了。我们干预你们在任何文化层面上的发展，还特别查阅过有关超自然现象的所有出版物。我知道我们两种文明不同，我们在完成任务的同时，会限制其他创造性活动的发展，但那并不重要。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That could not be allowed. I cannot explain the full nature of the threat you represented. It would not have been a threat to us, and therefore we do not comprehend it. Let us say that you might have become a telepathic cancer, a malignant mentality which in its inevitable dissolution would have poisoned other and greater minds.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这些应该被禁止。我无法解释那将是一场怎么样的浩劫，因为它不会影响我们的星球，我们不了解。这样说吧，你们也许会变成一个心灵感应的肿瘤、一种恶性的思想，不仅溃烂是无法避免的，它还会毒害其他更高层的智慧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"During the first half of the twentieth century, a few of your scientists began to investigate these matters. They did not know it, but they were tampering with the lock of Pandora's box. The forces they might have unleashed transcended any perils that the atom could have brought. For the physicists could only have ruined the Earth: the paraphysicists could have spread havoc to the stars.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“二十世纪前半叶，几个物理学家开始研究这些特异现象，他们不知道潘多拉盒子里究竟装的是什么，就想贸然打开盒子的锁，如果成功，他们释放出的力量可能超过所有原子弹的破坏力。他们在毁灭地球，而且还可能把这场浩劫带到其他星球上去。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Now I must tell you something which you may find very surprising, perhaps almost incredible. All these potentialities, all these latent powers -- we do not possess them, nor do we understand them. Our intellects are far more powerful than yours, but there is something in your minds that has always eluded us. Ever since we came to Earth we have been studying you; we have learned a great deal, and will learn more, yet I doubt if we shall discover all the truth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“有一件事你们会感到吃惊甚至难以相信，那就是我们自己没有这些力量，对这些力量的了解也只比你们多一点点，你们头脑中有些东西太难捕捉。通过对你们的长期观察，我们对这些力量已经有了一定了解，以后还会了解得更多，至于能不能完全了解，我不知道。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We held the clock back, we made you mark time while those powers developed, until they could come flooding out into the channels that were being prepared for them. What we did to improve your planet, to raise your standards of living, to bring justice and peace -- those things we should have done in any event, once we were forced to intervene in your affairs. But all that vast transformation diverted you from the truth, and therefore helped to serve our purpose.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Our races have much in common -- that is why we were chosen for this task. But in other respects, we represent the ends of two different evolutions. Our minds have reached the end of their development. So, in their present form, have yours. Yet you can make the jump to the next stage, and therein lies the difference between us. Our potentialities are exhausted, but yours are still untapped. They are linked, in ways we do not understand, with the powers I have mentioned -- the powers that are now awakening on your world.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们被派到这里来是因为我们两个种族有很多相似之处，但我们经历了两种不同的进化过程。我们的智力已经发展到了尽头，现在你们也一样，不同的是你们只是暂时的，你们还可以跳到下一个发展阶段。我们的潜力已经发掘完了，而你们的还几乎没有开始发掘。你们的潜力和前面提到的那些力量有着某种无法理解的联系。那些神秘力量在你们的世界中才刚刚开始。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"We believe -- it is only a theory -- that the Overmind Is trying to grow, to extend its powers and its awareness of the universe. By now it must be the sum of many races, and long ago it left the tyranny of matter behind. It is conscious of intelligence, everywhere. When it knew that you were almost ready, it sent us here to do its bidding, to prepare you for the transformation that is now at hand.</div>

<div class="line_en">"We are your guardians -- no more. Often you must have wondered what position my race held in the hierarchy of the universe. As we are above you, so there is something above us, using us for its own purposes. We have never discovered what it is, though we have been its tool for ages and dare not disobey it. Again and again we have received our orders, have gone to some world in the early flower of its civilization, and have guided it along the road that we can never follow -- the road that you are travelling now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们只是你们的保护者。你们可能想知道我们在宇宙中的地位，我们的地位比你们高，但我们上面还有一个统治者。我们不了解他，但已经替他工作很多年了，我们不敢违抗他。我们总是受命赶赴那些文明之花即将盛开的地方，引导那里的种族走一条我们自己不可能走的道路，就像你们现在走的路。”">查看中文翻译</div>

But we have glimpsed only the vague outlines of the truth. You called us the Overlords, not knowing the irony of that title. Let us say that above us is the Overmind, using us as the potter uses his wheel. And your race is the clay that is being shaped on that wheel.</div>

<div class="line_en">"As to the nature of that change, we can tell you very little. We do not know how it is produced -- what trigger impulse the Overmind employs when it judges that the time is ripe. All we have discovered is that it starts with a single individual -- always a child -- and then spreads explosively, like the formation of crystals round the first nucleus in a saturated solution. Adults will not be affected, for their minds are already set in an unalterable mould.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“至于这种转变的特征，我们也知之甚少，不知道超智慧统治者发现时机成熟时，会用什么办法来刺激转变的产生。我们只知道它们是从个体开始的，通常是小孩，紧接着就爆炸性地传开。成人不会被感染，他们的思维早就定型了，很难改变。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"All the earlier changes your race has known took countless ages. But this is a transformation of the mind, not of the body.

All the hopes and dreams of your race are ended now. You have given birth to your successors, and it is your tragedy that you will never understand them -- will never even be able to communicate with their minds. Indeed, they will not possess minds as you know them. They will be a single entity, as you yourselves are the sums of your myriad cells. You will not think them human, and you will be right.</div>
