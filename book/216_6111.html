<div class="line_en">Back on the raft we talked for a time and then the young man said, "My friends, I think I can tell you my secret now. I'm really a duke. My grandfather was the son of the Duke of Bridgewater, but he left England and came to America. When the old Duke died, my grandfather's younger brother stole everything and made himself the Duke of Bridgewater."</div>

<div class="line_en">Two or three days and nights went by and nothing much happened. We travelled at night when it was dark and everybody was asleep. We didn't want anyone to see Jim and ask questions about him.</div>

<div class="line_en">One of the men was about seventy years old; the other was about thirty, and they both had very old, dirty clothes. I said they could come with me, and we ran quickly back to the canoe.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其中一个人大约70岁，另外一个人大约30岁，他们俩都穿着很旧很脏的衣服。我说道，他们可以跟我来，我们很快跑回到了独木舟那儿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then, one morning, just after it was light, I found a little canoe, so I got into it and went over to the side of the river. I was looking round, when, suddenly, two men ran through the trees.</div>

<div class="line_en">And then the old man told us that he was really the first son of the King of France. He asked us all to go down on one knee when we spoke to him. we could call him "Your Majesty", too. So that was what we did, and they were both happy. Of course, I knew that they weren't really a duke and a king, but I didn't tell Jim. It's best if everybody is happy when you're living together on a raft.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后，那老人告诉我们，他的确是法国国王的长子。他要求我们跟他讲话时要单腿跪下。我们也可以称他为“陛下”。所以，这就是我们所做的一切，他们俩都很高兴。当然，我知道他们根本不是什么公爵和国王，可我没告诉吉姆。当你们共同生活在一只木筏上时，如果每一个人都快乐，那是最好不过了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I had to tell them something, so I said that Jim belonged to my uncle and was taking me to my family in New Orleans.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我得对他们说些什么，于是，我说，吉姆归我叔叔所有，他正把我送到新奥尔良的家去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, we'll travel down river with you, then," said the King. "We'll have a fine time together."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，那么，我们和你们一起旅行，”国王说道，“我们在一起会度过愉快的时光。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So we did things for him, and he liked it. But the old man spoke very little and he looked unhappy, too. After a time he said, "You know, Bridgewater, I, too, have a secret." And he began to cry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以，我们为他做事，他喜欢这样。可那个老人话说得很少，看上去也不高兴。过了一会，他说，“你要知道，布里奇沃特，我也有秘密。”他开始哭起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So the four of us went on down the river, but Jim and I didn't like those two men. They were always getting drunk and making plans to get money out of people in every town. It's all right to take a chicken or something if you're hungry, but these men were really bad! Jim and I decided to get away from them as soon as we could. It wasn't easy because they wanted to be with us all the time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，我们四人顺流而下，可我和吉姆不喜欢那两个人。他们总是喝得醉醺醺的，并计划在每一个镇上从人们那里搞到钱。如果你饿了，拿只鸡或什么的还可以，可这俩人坏透了。我和吉姆决定尽快地摆脱他们。这不容易，因为他们总要跟着我们。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then one morning the King went off into a town and told us to wait for him. We waited all morning and he didn't come back, so the Duke and I went into town to look for him. We looked all afternoon and in the end we found him in a bar, drunk, and then he and the Duke began to fight about some money.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一天，国王到一个镇上去了，让我们等他。我们等了他一上午，他没回来。于是，我和公爵到镇上去找他。我们找了一下午，最后，在一个酒吧里找到了他，他醉醺醺的。然后，他和公爵为钱开始打起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now we can get away from them, I thought. I turned and ran back to the river. "Quick, Jim!" I shouted. "It's time to go!" But there was no answer. Jim wasn't there!</div>

<div class="line_en">"Why, yes," the boy replied. "He's a runaway slave. I heard all about it in town. A family called the Phelpses have got him now. An old man in a bar told Mr Phelps that there was a runaway slave on a raft down by the river. He said he hadn't got time to take the slave back himself. So Mr Phelps gave him forty dollars and they went down and caught the slave this afternoon. The Phelpses are going to take him back to his owner, and they'll get three hundred dollars for him!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“看见了，”那男孩回答道，“他是一个逃跑的奴隶。我是在镇上听到这些的。斐尔普斯一家人抓到了他。酒吧里的一个老头告诉斐尔普斯先生，在河下游方向河边的木筏上有一个逃跑的奴隶。他说，他自己没有时间亲自把那奴隶抓来。于是，斐尔普斯先生给了他40美元，今天下午到那去抓住了那个奴隶。斐尔普斯打算把他送回到他的主人那儿去。为了这个奴隶，他们会得到300美元。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, what took you so long? We thought you were coming two days ago. Your Uncle Silas goes to town every day to meet you. He's there now, but he'll be back soon.

<div class="line_en">I began to make plans to get Jim back. First, I took the raft and went down to a little island. I hid the raft under the treesand lay down to sleep. Before it was light, I went off down the river in the canoe. When I thought I was near the Phelpses place, I stopped, got out of the canoe and went up to the house. Suddenly, a lot of dogs ran out. They came from everywhere and they made a terrible noise.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我开始制定救吉姆的计划。首先，我乘木筏顺流而下来到一个小岛。我把木筏藏在树下，躺下睡着了。天亮之前，我乘着独木舟顺流而下。当我觉得我已靠近斐尔普斯住处时，我停了下来，从独木舟上下来，朝那座房子走去。突然，有许多狗跑出来。他们朝我围过来，发出可怕的叫声。">查看中文翻译</div>
