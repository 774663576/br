<div class="line_en">The result of our having everything out was simply to reduce our situation to the last rigor of its elements. She herself had seen nothing, not the shadow of a shadow, and nobody in the house but the governess was in the governess's plight; yet she accepted without directly impugning my sanity the truth as I gave it to her, and ended by showing me, on this ground, an awestricken tenderness, an expression of the sense of my more than questionable privilege, of which the very breath has remained with me as that of the sweetest of human charities.</div>

<div class="line_en">There had been, this evening, after the revelation left me, for an hour, so prostrate -- there had been, for either of us, no attendance on any service but a little service of tears and vows, of prayers and promises, a climax to the series of mutual challenges and pledges that had straightway ensued on our retreating together to the schoolroom and shutting ourselves up there to have everything out.</div>

But there was everything, for our apprehension, in the lucky fact that no discomfortable legend, no perturbation of scullions, had ever, within anyone's memory attached to the kind old place.

<div class="line_en">The limit of this evil time had arrived only when, on the dawn of a winter's morning, Peter Quint was found, by a laborer going to early work, stone dead on the road from the village: a catastrophe explained -- superficially at least -- by a visible wound to his head; such a wound as might have been produced -- and as, on the final evidence, HAD been -- by a fatal slip, in the dark and after leaving the public house, on the steepish icy slope, a wrong path altogether, at the bottom of which he lay. The icy slope, the turn mistaken at night and in liquor, accounted for much -- practically, in the end and after the inquest and boundless chatter, for everything; but there had been matters in his life -- strange passages and perils, secret disorders, vices more than suspected -- that would have accounted for a good deal more.</div>

<div class="line_en">I walked in a world of their invention -- they had no occasion whatever to draw upon mine; so that my time was taken only with being, for them, some remarkable person or thing that the game of the moment required and that was merely, thanks to my superior, my exalted stamp, a happy and highly distinguished sinecure.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我走进他们构筑的世界——他们没有任何机会来参与到我的世界，所以，我只在他们的游戏需要扮演某个特别的人或什么特别的事的时候出现，这完全得益于我的主人和我突出的才情，我才得到了这份快乐的、非常体面的闲职。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My attention to them all really went to seeing them amuse themselves immensely without me: this was a spectacle they seemed actively to prepare and that engaged me as an active admirer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我注意到，他们旁若无人地自得其乐，这好像就是他们积极准备的演出，而我则成了活跃的仰慕者。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I forget what I was on the present occasion; I only remember that I was something very important and very quiet and that Flora was playing very hard. We were on the edge of the lake, and, as we had lately begun geography, the lake was the Sea of Azof.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我忘记了自己现在的身份，我只记得我很重要、很平静，弗洛拉玩得很痛快。我们呆在湖边，因为我们最近在学地理，这个湖的名字是“阿佐夫湖”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The way this knowledge gathered in me was the strangest thing in the world -- the strangest, that is, except the very much stranger in which it quickly merged itself. I had sat down with a piece of work -- for I was something or other that could sit -- on the old stone bench which overlooked the pond; and in this position I began to take in with certitude, and yet without direct vision, the presence, at a distance, of a third person.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个念头在我的心里萌生的方式即是这世上最奇怪的事了——最奇怪的是，除此以外，就是这个陌生人是从哪里快速出现的。我坐在湖边一张可以俯视湖面的旧石凳上看书，当时我确实开始被书中的情节所吸引，但是，用不着直视，我就发现在远处有一个人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Suddenly, in these circumstances, I became aware that, on the other side of the Sea of Azof, we had an interested spectator.</div>

<div class="line_en">I recollect counting over perfectly the possibilities, reminding myself that nothing was more natural, for instance, then the appearance of one of the men about the place, or even of a messenger, a postman, or a tradesman's boy, from the village.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was no ambiguity in anything; none whatever, at least, in the conviction I from one moment to another found myself forming as to what I should see straight before me and across the lake as a consequence of raising my eyes. They were attached at this juncture to the stitching in which I was engaged, and I can feel once more the spasm of my effort not to move them till I should so have steadied myself as to be able to make up my mind what to do. There was an alien object in view -- a figure whose right of presence I instantly, passionately questioned.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没有什么是模棱两可的，一切都看得一清二楚，至少当时我坚信，只要一抬眼，我就能清楚地看到眼前和对岸的一切。我的双眼聚焦在那个我正观察的地方，我感觉到自己再次努力不转移视线，直到我稳定了自己，能够决定下一步该怎么做。视野中有一个不速之客——这个人的出现立即引起了我强烈的怀疑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This was her attitude when I at last looked at her -- looked with the confirmed conviction that we were still, together, under direct personal notice. She had picked up a small flat piece of wood, which happened to have in it a little hole that had evidently suggested to her the idea of sticking in another fragment that might figure as a mast and make the thing a boat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是我最后看到的她的姿势——我非常确信，我们俩一起仍然处于那个人的监视之下。她捡起了一小块平整的木板，木板上正好有一个小洞，这使她有了把另一块碎木片插在小洞里当帆，把它做成小船的想法。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I waited, but nothing came; then, in the first place -- and there is something more dire in this, I feel, than in anything I have to relate -- I was determined by a sense that, within a minute, all sounds from her had previously dropped; and, in the second, by the circumstance that, also within the minute, she had, in her play, turned her back to the water.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我等待着，但什么都没发生。然后，首先发生的比这个更可怕的事是，直觉让我判断出来自她的声音预先变低了——我觉得这比我胡乱猜想的任何事情更加可怕。其次是片刻后，她沉浸在游戏中，转过身背对着湖水继续玩。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Of the positive identity of the apparition I would assure myself as soon as the small clock of my courage should have ticked out the right second; meanwhile, with an effort that was already sharp enough, I transferred my eyes straight to little Flora, who, at the moment, was about ten yards away. My heart had stood still for an instant with the wonder and terror of the question whether she too would see; and I held my breath while I waited for what a cry from her, what some sudden innocent sign either of interest or of alarm, would tell me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="瞬间我的勇气像跳动了一下指针的小闹钟一般恢复过来，我极为确信地告诉自己，这绝对只是个幽灵；同时，我用自己已经足够大的努力将目光移开，转向正在十码开外的地方玩耍的弗洛拉。我的心突然停滞，充满疑虑和恐慌地思考一个问题，不知道她是不是也能看到那个人。我屏住呼吸，等她哭叫起来，或者突然流露出好奇或惊吓的天真表情，这些都会直接告诉我答案。">查看中文翻译</div>
