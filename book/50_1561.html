<div class="line_en">One grave in every graveyard belongs to the ghouls. Wander any graveyard long enough and you will find it -- waterstained and bulging, with cracked or broken stone, scraggly grass or rank weeds about it, and a feeling, when you reach it, of abandonment. It may be colder than the other gravestones, too, and the name on the stone is all too often impossible to read. If there is a statue on the grave it will be headless or so scabbed with fungus and lichens as to look like a fungus itself. If one grave in a graveyard looks like a target for petty vandals, that is the ghoul-gate. If the grave makes you want to be somewhere else, that is the ghoul-gate.</div>

<div class="line_en">The first thing he saw was a bag. It was, Bod knew the moment he laid eyes on it, Silas's bag. It was at least a hundred and fifty years old, a thing of beauty, black leather with brass fittings and a black handle, the kind of bag a Victorian doctor or undertaker might have carried, containing every implement that might have been needed. Bod had never seen Silas's bag before, he had not even known that Silas had a bag, but it was the sort of bag that could only have belonged to Silas. Bod tried to peek inside it, but it was closed with a large brass padlock. It was too heavy for him to lift.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第一样东西是个皮箱，伯蒂一看就知道这属于赛拉斯。皮箱由漂亮的黑色皮革制成，带有黄色配件和黑色提手，至少有一百五十年的历史。维多利亚时期的医生或殡葬承办人经常随身携带这种皮箱，里头的工具一应俱全。伯蒂从没见过赛拉斯的皮箱，他甚至不知道赛拉斯有个皮箱，但这样的皮箱只可能属于赛拉斯。伯蒂试着往皮箱里窥探，可皮箱被一把硕大的黄铜锁锁得严严实实。他又试着把皮箱提起来，可太重了，他提不动。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Miss Lupescu said nothing. She sniffed. Then she looked at Silas and said, "So. This is the boy."

<div class="line_cn" title="卢佩斯库小姐没说话。她闻了闻伯蒂，接着对赛拉斯说：“所以说，这就是那个孩子。”她从椅子上站起来，开始围着伯蒂转，鼻孔张开，像是在嗅他的气味。转完一圈后，她对伯蒂说：“你每天早上醒来以及晚上睡觉前都要来向我汇报。我在那边的那座房子里租了一个房间。”她指向一栋只露出屋顶的房子，“不过，我平日都会待在这片坟场。我是一名历史学家，研究古墓的历史。听明白了吗，孩子？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="拥抱赛拉斯是伯蒂无法想象的，于是他伸出一只手。赛拉斯弯下腰，用自己苍白的大手轻柔地握了握伯蒂脏兮兮的小手，然后轻松地拎起自己的黑色皮箱，沿着小路走出坟场，仿佛他的皮箱轻如无物。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Silas had brought Bod food, true, and left it in the crypt each night for him to eat, but this was, as far as Bod was concerned, the least of the things that Silas did for him. He gave advice, cool, sensible, and unfailingly correct; he knew more than the graveyard folk did, for his nightly excursions into the world outside meant that he was able to describe a world that was current, not hundreds of years out of date; he was unflappable and dependable, had been there every night of Bod's life, so the idea of the little chapel without its only inhabitant was one that Bod found difficult to conceive of; most of all, he made Bod feel safe.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="赛拉斯的确会为伯蒂带吃的，他每晚会把食物放在教堂的地下室里，可在伯蒂看来，这在赛拉斯为他做的所有事之中是那么不足挂齿。赛拉斯会为他提供建议——冷静、理智、万无一失的建议。他所知的比坟场居民要多得多，因为他每夜都要到外面的世界去，所以他能为伯蒂描述当前的世界，而不是几百年前早已过时的世界。他处变不惊，十分可靠，在伯蒂从小到大的每一夜都未曾缺席。因此一想到小教堂里要空了，伯蒂感到难以接受。最重要的是，赛拉斯能给他安全感。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mrs. Owens said, "Back when you were born he promised us that if he had to leave, he would find someone else to bring you food and keep an eye on you, and he has. He's so reliable."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Good food," said Miss Lupescu. They were in the crypt. She had put two plastic containers on the tabletop, and opened the lids. She pointed to the first: "Is beetroot-barley-stew-soup." She pointed to the second. "Is salad. Now, you eat both. I make them for you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“健康的食物。”卢佩斯库小姐说。他们正在教堂的地下室，卢佩斯库小姐往桌上放了两个塑料盒，打开了第一个盒子的盖子。“这是甜菜大麦羹。”她又指向第二个盒子，“这是沙拉。你把这俩都吃了，这些是我为你做的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Bod was hungry. He took a plastic spoon, dipped it into the purple-red stew, and he ate. The food was slimy and unfamiliar, but he kept it down.</div>

<div class="line_en">Bod stared up at her to see if this was a joke. Food from Silas mostly came in packets, purchased from the kind of places that sold food late at night and asked no questions. No one had ever brought him food in a plastic container with a lid before. "It smells horrible," he said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伯蒂盯着她的脸，确认她不是在开玩笑。赛拉斯带来的食物通常是袋装食品，买自那些深夜售卖且不提问题的地方。从来没人给他带过装在有盖塑料盒子里的食物。“好难闻啊。”伯蒂说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Now the salad!" said Miss Lupescu, and she unpopped the top of the second container.

He could feel the saliva gathering, and realized that if he swallowed it, he would throw it back up. He said, "I can't eat this."</div>

<div class="line_en">The huge moon rose and the smaller mold-colored moon and they were joined by a ruby-red moon, and the grey wolf ran at a steady lope beneath them across the desert of bones. She stopped by a broken clay building like an enormous beehive, built beside a small rill of water that came bubbling out of the desert rock, splashed down into a tiny pool and was gone again. The grey wolf put her head down and drank, and Bod scooped water up in his hands, drinking the water in a dozen tiny gulps.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="硕大的月亮升了起来，接着是蓝绿色的小月亮，随后又升起一轮红宝石色泽的月亮。灰色巨兽以稳健的速度大步奔跑，穿过遍地尸骨的沙漠。她在一个巨大蜂巢般的破损陶土建筑边停下，旁边有一条溪流自沙漠的岩缝汩汩往外冒，汇成一个个小水洼，转瞬蒸发。灰兽低头喝水，伯蒂用手捧起水，咕嘟嘟地喝下去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"This is the boundary," said the grey wolf that was Miss Lupescu, and Bod looked up. The three moons had gone. Now he could see the Milky Way, see it as he had never seen it before, a glimmering shroud across the arch of the sky. The sky was filled with stars.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这儿是边界。”卢佩斯库小姐说。伯蒂抬起头。三个月亮消失了，他看到了银河，和以往见过的景致迥乎不同。银河如一条闪闪发亮的裹尸布，横跨天穹，伴以璀璨群星。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Bod clambered onto her huge, grey back once more and he buried his face in her fur and held on tightly, and it seemed only moments later that he was being carried -- awkwardly, as a grown woman carries a six-year-old boy -- across the graveyard, to the Owenses' tomb.</div>

<div class="line_en">Bod's left ankle was swollen and purple. Doctor Trefusis (1870-1936, May He Wake to Glory) inspected it and pronounced it merely sprained.

<div class="line_cn" title="“太好了。”赛拉斯说。一只停在橡树上的猫头鹰叫了一声。“要知道，我在外头听到了一些传言，说几周前你们去了我无法追踪的地方。一般来说，我会建议你们多加小心，不过好在食尸鬼不像别的东西，他们记性不好。”">查看中文翻译</div>
