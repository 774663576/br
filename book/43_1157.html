<div class="line_en">Like bees swarming after their queen, mother and daughters hovered about Mr. March the next day, neglecting everything to look at, wait upon, and listen to the new invalid, who was in a fair way to be killed by kindness. As he sat propped up in a big chair by Beth's sofa, with the other three close by, and Hannah popping in her head now and then 'to peek at the dear man', nothing seemed needed to complete their happiness. But something was needed, and the elder ones felt it, though none confessed the fact. Mr. and Mrs. March looked at one another with an anxious expression, as their eyes followed Meg. Jo had sudden fits of sobriety, and was seen to shake her fist at Mr. Brooke's umbrella, which had been left in the hall. Meg was absent-minded, shy, and silent, started when the bell rang, and colored when John's name was mentioned. Amy said, "Everyone seemed waiting for something, and couldn't settle down, which was queer, since Father was safe at home," and Beth innocently wondered why their neighbors didn't run over as usual.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“那傻子是什么意思？”梅格故作莫明其妙地笑着问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He's showing you how your John will go on by-and-by. Touching, isn't it?" answered Jo scornfully.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他在向你示范你的约翰日后会怎么做。感人吧，哼！”乔奚落道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We can't, for something has been said, and Laurie's mischief has spoiled you for me. I see it, and so does Mother. You are not like your old self a bit, and seem ever so far away from me. I don't mean to plague you and will bear it like a man, but I do wish it was all settled. I hate to wait, so if you mean ever to do it, make haste and have it over quickly," said Jo pettishly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们办不到，因为已经说出来了，劳里的恶作剧已毁了你在我心中的形象。我看出来了，妈妈也一样；你完完全全换了一个人，似乎离我那么遥远。我不想烦你，而且会像一个男子汉一样承受此事，但我很想它有个了断。我痛恨等待，所以如果你有意的话，就请快刀斩乱麻，”乔没好气地说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Laurie went by in the afternoon, and seeing Meg at the window, seemed suddenly possessed with a melodramatic fit, for he fell down on one knee in the snow, beat his breast, tore his hair, and clasped his hands imploringly, as if begging some boon. And when Meg told him to behave himself and go away, he wrung imaginary tears out of his handkerchief, and staggered round the corner as if in utter despair.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="下午劳里来了，看到梅格坐在窗边，仿佛一下子心血来潮，单膝跪在雪地上，捶胸扯发，还哀求地十指交叉握紧两手，犹如乞讨什么恩典；梅格叫他放尊重一点，命他走开，他又用自己的手帕绞出几滴假泪，然后绕着墙角摇摇晃晃而去，仿佛伤心欲绝。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Don't say my John, it isn't proper or true," but Meg's voice lingered over the words as if they sounded pleasant to her. "Please don't plague me, Jo, I've told you I don't care much about him, and there isn't to be anything said, but we are all to be friendly, and go on as before."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“别说我的约翰，这不合适，也并非事实。”但梅格的声音却恋恋不舍地在这四个字上头慢慢拖过，似在品尝其中滋味。”别烦我了，乔，我跟你说过我对他并没有特别的意思，这事也没什么可说的，我们还像以前一样友好来往。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I can't say anything till he speaks, and he won't, because Father said I was too young," began Meg, bending over her work with a queer little smile, which suggested that she did not quite agree with her father on that point.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“除非他开口，否则我没法说或者做什么，但他不会说的，因为爸爸说我还太年轻，”梅格说，一面低着头做活，脸上露出一丝异样的微笑，表明在这一点上他不很赞同父亲的意见。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I think not, if you liked anyone very much, and he liked you." Meg spoke as if to herself, and glanced out at the lane where she had often seen lovers walking together in the summer twilight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不这样看，如果你很喜欢一个人，而他也喜欢你的话。”梅格仿佛自言自语，眼光向外面一条小巷望去。她常常看到恋人们在夏日的黄昏下在这条小巷双双散步。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，我只会十分沉着十分干脆地说：‘谢谢你，布鲁克先生，你的心意我领了，但我和爸爸都认为我还太年轻，暂且不宜订约，此事请不必再提，我们仍如以前一样做朋友。’”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Hum, that's stiff and cool enough! I don't believe you'll ever say it, and I know he won't be satisfied if you do. If he goes on like the rejected lovers in books, you'll give in, rather than hurt his feelings."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哼！说得真够气派！我不信你会这样说，即使说了他也不会甘心。如果他像小说里头那些遭到拒绝的年青人一样纠缠不休，你就会答应他，而不愿伤害他的感情。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Meg rose as she spoke, and was just going to rehearse the dignified exit, when a step in the hall made her fly into her seat and begin to sew as fast as if her life depended on finishing that particular seam in a given time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="梅格说着站起来，正准备排练那尊严退出的一幕，突然客厅里传来一阵脚步声，她吓得飞身走回座位，赶紧拿起针线活，飞快地缝起来，仿佛她的生命全系于那一针一线之间。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jo smothered a laugh at the sudden change, and when someone gave a modest tap, opened the door with a grim aspect which was anything but hospitable.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乔见状忍着笑，这时有人轻轻敲了一下门，她没好气地打开门，板着一张脸孔，令人望而生畏。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's very well, he's in the rack. I'll get him, and tell it you are here." And having jumbled her father and the umbrella well together in her reply, Jo slipped out of the room to give Meg a chance to make her speech and air her dignity. But the instant she vanished, Meg began to sidle toward the door, murmuring…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“很好，他在搁物架上，我去找他，告诉它你来了。”乔回答时把父亲和雨伞混为一谈，然后溜出房间，给梅格一个显示尊严的说话机会。但她的身影刚一消失，梅格便侧身向门口行去，吞吞吐吐地说——">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Good afternoon. I came to get my umbrella, that is, to see how your father finds himself today," said Mr. Brooke, getting a trifle confused as his eyes went from one telltale face to the other.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“下午好。我来拿我的雨伞——顺便，看看你爸爸今天怎么样，”布鲁克先生说。看到姐妹二人神色异常，他感到有点诧异。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Don't go. Are you afraid of me, Margaret?" and Mr. Brooke looked so hurt that Meg thought she must have done something very rude. She blushed up to the little curls on her forehead, for he had never called her Margaret before, and she was surprised to find how natural and sweet it seemed to hear him say it. Anxious to appear friendly and at her ease, she put out her hand with a confiding gesture, and said gratefully…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“别走。你是不是怕我，玛格丽特？”布鲁克先生显得十分沮丧，梅格以为自己干了什么极端无礼粗鲁的事情。他以前从来没叫过她玛格丽特，现在这话从他口里发出，她不知为何脸涨得红至发根。她急于表明自己的善意和轻松心情，于是做了个信任的姿势，伸出一只手来，感激地说——">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Shall I tell you how?" asked Mr. Brooke, holding the small hand fast in both his own, and looking down at Meg with so much love in the brown eyes that her heart began to flutter, and she both longed to run away and to stop and listen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“要不要我告诉你怎样谢？”布鲁克先生问道，双手紧紧握住那只小手，低头望着梅格，棕色的眼睛流露出无限爱意。梅格心头怦怦乱跳，既想跑开，又想停下细听。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh no, please don't, I'd rather not," she said, trying to withdraw her hand, and looking frightened in spite of her denial.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，不，请不要这样——还是别说好，”她边说边试图把手抽回，脸上忍不住流露出惊慌的神色。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This was the moment for the calm, proper speech, but Meg didn't make it. She forgot every word of it, hung her head, and answered, "I don't know," so softly that John had to stoop down to catch the foolish little reply.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这本来到了镇静自若地说那番漂亮话的时候了，但梅格却没有说；她一个字也记不起来了，只是低垂着头，答：“我不知道。”声音又轻又软，约翰得弯下腰来才勉强听到这句傻气的回答。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He seemed to think it was worth the trouble, for he smiled to himself as if quite satisfied, pressed the plump hand gratefully, and said in his most persuasive tone, "Will you try and find out?

<div class="line_en">His tone was properly beseeching, but stealing a shy look at him, Meg saw that his eyes were merry as well as tender, and that he wore the satisfied smile of one who had no doubt of his success. This nettled her. Annie Moffat's foolish lessons in coquetry came into her mind, and the love of power, which sleeps in the bosoms of the best of little women, woke up all of a sudden and took possession of her. She felt excited and strange, and not knowing what else to do, followed a capricious impulse, and, withdrawing her hands, said petulantly, "I don't choose. Please go away and let me be!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他说得情真意切，但梅格含羞偷偷看他一眼，却看到他一双含情脉脉的眼睛藏着喜意，嘴角挂着一丝成功在握的微笑，十分得意，心中不觉着了恼。此时安妮·莫法特教给她的愚蠢的卖俏邀宠之道，闯进了她的脑海，一股潜藏于小妇人内心深处的支配欲在心中突然升起，令她失去自制。由于兴奋激动，她头昏眼花，手足无措，一时冲动，竟把双手抽出，怒声说道：“我不想学。请走开。别烦我！”">查看中文翻译</div>

The best of us have a spice of perversity in us, especially when we are young and in love. If Aunt March had begged Meg to accept John Brooke, she would probably have declared she couldn't think of it, but as she was preemptorily ordered not to like him, she immediately made up her mind that she would. Inclination as well as perversity made the decision easy, and being already much excited, Meg opposed the old lady with unusual spirit.</div>
