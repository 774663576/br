<div class="line_en">Christer Malm was sitting on the sofa. He was uncomfortable. It was the first time since they founded Millennium that he had seen Berger and Blomkvist in such disagreement. Over all the years they had been inseparable. Sometimes they had furious clashes, but their arguments were always about business matters, and they would invariably resolve all those issues before they hugged each other and went back to their corners. Or to bed. Last autumn had not been fun, and now it was as if a great gulf had opened up between them. Malm wondered if he was watching the beginning of the end of Millennium.</div>

And not because you're leaving your job as publisher -- that's a smart decision in this situation. I can go along with making it look like a schism or a power struggle between you and me -- I understand the logic when it's a matter of making Wennerström believe I'm a harmless bimbo and you're the real threat." She paused and now looked him resolutely in the eye. "But I think you're making a mistake. Wennerström isn't going to fall for it. He's going to keep on destroying Millennium. The only difference is that starting from today, I have to fight him alone, and you know that you're needed more than ever on the editorial board. OK, I'd love to wage war against Wennerström, but what makes me so cross is that you're abandoning ship all of a sudden. You're leaving me in the lurch when things are absolutely at their worst ever."</div>
