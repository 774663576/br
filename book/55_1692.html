<div class="line_en">For most of human history, the justification for war was pithily captured by Julius Caesar: "I came. I saw. I conquered." Conquest was what governments did. Empires rose, empires fell, entire populations were annihilated or enslaved, and no one seemed to think there was anything wrong with it. The historical figures who earned the honorific "So-and-So the Great" were not great artists, scholars, doctors, or inventors, people who enhanced human happiness or wisdom. They were dictators who conquered large swaths of territory and the people in them. If Hitler's luck had held out a bit longer, he probably would have gone down in history as Adolf the Great. Even today the standard histories of war teach the reader a great deal about horses and armor and gunpowder but give only the vaguest sense that immense numbers of people were killed and maimed in these extravaganzas.</div>

<div class="line_en">The occasional Western seer too paid homage to the ideal of peace. The prophet Isaiah expressed the hope that "they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more." Jesus preached, "Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you. If someone strikes you on one cheek, turn to him the other also." Though Christianity began as a pacifist movement, things went downhill in 312 CE when the Roman ruler Constantine had a vision of a flaming cross in the sky with the words "In this sign thou shalt conquer" and converted the Roman Empire to this militant version of the faith.</div>

<div class="line_en">Periodic expressions of pacifism or war-weariness over the next millennium did nothing to stop the nearly constant state of warfare. According to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, the premises of international law during the Middle Ages were as follows: "In the absence of an agreed state of truce or peace, war was the basic state of international relations even between independent Christian communities; (2) Unless exceptions were made by means of individual safe conduct or treaty, rulers saw themselves entitled to treat foreigners at their absolute discretion; (3) The high seas were no-man's-land, where anyone might do as he pleased."

<div class="line_en">One way to drive home the futility and evil of war is to tap the distancing power of satire. A moralizer can be mocked, a polemicist can be silenced, but a satirist can get the same point across through stealth. By luring an audience into taking the perspective of an outsider -- a fool, a foreigner, a traveler -- a satirist can make them appreciate the hypocrisy of their own society and the flaws in human nature that foster it. If the audience gets the joke, if the readers or viewers lose themselves in the work, they have tacitly acceded to the author's deconstruction of a norm without anyone having had to rebuff it in so many words. Shakespeare's Falstaff, for example, delivers the finest analysis ever expressed of the concept of honor, the source of so much violence over the course of human history. Prince Hal has urged him into battle, saying "Thou owest God a death." Falstaff muses:</div>

<div class="line_en">Together with satires suggesting that war was hypocritical and contemptible, the 18th century saw the appearance of theories holding that it was irrational and avoidable. One of the foremost was gentle commerce, the theory that the positive-sum payoff of trade should be more appealing than the zero-sum or negative-sum payoff of war. Though the mathematics of game theory would not be available for another two hundred years, the key idea could be stated easily enough in words: Why spend money and blood to invade a country and plunder its treasure when you can just buy it from them at less expense and sell them some of your own? The Abbé de Saint Pierre (1713), Montesquieu (1748), Adam Smith (1776), George Washington (1788), and Immanuel Kant (1795) were some of the writers who extolled free trade because it yoked the material interests of nations and thus encouraged them to value one another's well-being. As Kant put it, "The spirit of commerce sooner or later takes hold of every people, and it cannot exist side by side with war… Thus states find themselves compelled to promote the noble cause of peace, though not exactly from motives of morality."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在讽刺作品告诉大家战争的虚伪和卑鄙的同时，18世纪开始出现论证战争非理性和可避免的新理论。最早出现的是“文明商业”，即正和收益的交易必定比零和或者负和收益的战争更有吸引力。虽然还要再等200年，人类才会使用博弈论的数学语言，但其关键的思想可以简明地用文字表述如下：如果你能够用小钱去向别国购买财宝，再作为自己的东西卖出去，为什么还要花大钱再加上流血死人去侵犯别国，抢劫这些财宝呢？圣皮埃尔神父（The Abbé de Saint Pierre，1713年）、孟德斯鸠（1748年）、亚当·斯密（1776年）、乔治·华盛顿（1788年）和康德（1795年）都在文章和著作中赞扬自由贸易，因为它把各国的物质利益联结在一起，鼓励它们彼此珍重对方的存在。正如康德所说：“商业的精神迟早会抓住每一个人，它是不能和战争共存的…所以，尽管不完全是出于道德的动机，各国都会热衷于宣扬崇高的和平。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Satires appeared in France as well. In one of his pensées, Blaise Pascal (1623-62) imagined the following dialogue: "Why are you killing me for your own benefit? I am unarmed." "Why, do you not live on the other side of the water? My friend, if you lived on this side, I should be a murderer, but since you live on the other side, I am a hero, and it is just." Voltaire's Candide (1759) was another novel that slipped scathing antiwar commentary into the mouth of a fictitious character, such as the following definition of war: "A million assassins in uniform, roaming from one end of Europe to the other, murder and pillage with discipline in order to earn their daily bread."</div>

<div class="line_en">The most remarkable antiwar document of the era was Kant's 1795 essay "Perpetual Peace." Kant was no dreamer; he began the essay with the self-deprecating confession that he took the title of his essay from the caption on an innkeeper's sign with a picture of a burial ground. He then laid out six preliminary steps toward perpetual peace, followed by three sweeping principles. The preliminary steps were that peace treaties should not leave open the option of war; that states should not absorb other states; that standing armies should be abolished; that governments should not borrow to finance wars; that a state should not interfere in the internal governance of another state; and that in war, states should avoid tactics that would undermine confidence in a future peace, such as assassinations, poisonings, and incitements to treason.</div>

<div class="line_en">He then outlined his three conditions for perpetual peace. The first is that states should be democratic. Kant himself preferred the term republican, because he associated the word democracy with mob rule; what he had in mind was a government dedicated to freedom, equality, and the rule of law. Democracies are unlikely to fight each other, Kant argued, for two reasons. One is that a democracy is a form of government that by design ("having sprung from the pure source of the concept of law") is built around nonviolence. A democratic government wields its power only to safeguard the rights of its citizens. Democracies, Kant reasoned, are apt to externalize this principle to their dealings with other nations, who are no more deserving of domination by force than are their own citizens.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着他概述了他的永久和平的三大条件。第一个条件是，各国都是民主政体。康德自己使用的字眼是共和制，因为他将民主与暴民统治联结在一起，他脑子里所想的是一个致力于自由、平等和法治的政府。康德争辩说，民主政体之所以不会互相开战，有两个原因：第一，民主作为一种设计的政府形式，基础是非暴力的——这个设计“源自于纯粹的法治概念”。民主政府只有在保护自己公民的权利时才会使用武力。康德这样推理，民主国家往往会在与其他国家交涉时将这一原则外部化，这些其他国家也只应该由自己的公民而不是其他势力所统治。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The state of peace among men living side by side is not the natural state; the natural state is one of war. This does not always mean open hostilities, but at least an unceasing threat of war. A state of peace, therefore, must be established, for in order to be secured against hostility it is not sufficient that hostilities simply be not committed; and, unless this security is pledged to each by his neighbor (a thing that can occur only in a civil state), each may treat his neighbor, from whom he demands this security, as an enemy.</div>

<div class="line_en">More important, democracies tend to avoid wars because the benefits of war go to a country's leaders whereas the costs are paid by its citizens. In an autocracy "a declaration of war is the easiest thing in the world to decide upon, because war does not require of the ruler, who is the proprietor and not a member of the state, the least sacrifice of the pleasures of his table, the chase, his country houses, his court functions, and the like. He may, therefore, resolve on war as on a pleasure party for the most trivial reasons." But if the citizens are in charge, they will think twice about wasting their own money and blood on a foolish foreign adventure.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="更重要的是，民主政体倾向于避免战争，因为所有战争的收益都归国家领袖，而代价则由人民来支付。在专制政体下，“世界上最容易做出的决定就是宣战，因为对于一个专制的统治者来说，他是领主而不是国家的成员，战争不需要他牺牲任何快乐，诸如他的餐饮、他的狩猎、他的乡间别墅、他的宫廷仪式，如此等等。因此，他很可能为一些最微不足道的理由发动战争，就像他因为开心而举办一次晚会一样”。但是，如果权力在民，他们就会考虑为什么要在愚蠢的外国冒险上浪费自己的钱财和生命。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Kant's second condition for perpetual peace was that "the law of nations shall be founded on a Federation of Free States"-- a "League of Nations," as he also called it. This federation, a kind of international Leviathan, would provide objective, third-party adjudication of disputes, circumventing every nation's tendency to believe that it is always in the right. Just as individuals accede to a social contract in which they surrender some of their freedom to the state to escape the nastiness of anarchy, so it should be with states: "For states in their relation to each other, there cannot be any reasonable way out of the lawless condition which entails only war except that they, like individual men, should give up their savage (lawless) freedom, adjust themselves to the constraints of public law, and thus establish a continuously growing state consisting of various nations which will ultimately include all the nations of the world."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="康德永久和平的第二个条件是“以自由国家的联盟为基础制定国际法”——一个“国联”，他正是这样称呼它的。这个联盟是一个国际化的利维坦，鉴于每一个国家都认定自己永远正确，国联将超越单个国家，对争端提供客观的第三方仲裁。正如为了避免可怕的无政府状态，个人认同社会契约，向国家交出某些个人的自由，国家之于国联则是：“对于国家和其他国家的关系，只存在一种合理的方式让世界能够避免无法无天的必然引发战争的局面。如同个人，国家必须放弃它们蛮横（无法无天）的自由，将自己纳入公法的制约，从而建立一个包括不同国家的不断增长的实体，最后将世界上所有的国家均纳入其中。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Kant didn't have in mind a world government with a global army. He thought that international laws could be self-enforcing. "The homage which each state pays (at least in words) to the concept of law proves that there is slumbering in man an even greater moral disposition to become master of the evil principle in himself (which he cannot disclaim) and to hope for the same from others." The author of "Perpetual Peace" was, after all, the same man who proposed the Categorical Imperative, which stated that people should act so that the maxim of their action can be universalized. This is all starting to sound a bit starry-eyed, but Kant brought the idea back to earth by tying it to the spread of democracy. Each of two democracies can recognize the validity of the principles that govern the other. That sets them apart from theocracies, which are based on parochial faiths, and from autocracies, which are based on clans, dynasties, or charismatic leaders. In other words, if one state has reason to believe that a neighboring one organizes its political affairs in the same way that it does because both have stumbled upon the same solution to the problem of government, then neither has to worry about the other one attacking, neither will be tempted to attack the other in preemptive self-defense, and so on, freeing everyone from the Hobbesian trap. Today, for example, the Swedes don't stay up at night worrying that their neighbors are hatching plans for Norway Über Alles, or vice versa.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="康德没有想过一个备有全球军队的世界政府。他认为，国际法是自我执行的。“各国对法律这个概念（至少在言辞上）的尊重证明，人身上还沉睡着更强大的道德意愿，要去克制自己身上的（他无法拒绝的）邪恶因素，并且期望其他人也有同样的意愿。”说到底，《永久和平论》的作者也就是提出“绝对命令”的人，绝对命令（或“绝对律令”）是指人应该按照能够成为普遍行为准则的方式行动。这些乍听起来都是虚无缥缈的空想，但康德把这一思想与民主的传播联结在一起，让这一思想落在坚实的地面上。两个民主国家可以相互承认对方所遵从的原则的有效性。这将它们区别于神权政体，神权国家的基础是宗教信仰；这也将它们区别于专制政体，专制国家的基础是家族、王朝或者有魅力的领袖。换句话说，如果一个国家有理由相信它的邻国是按照与自己相同的方式组织政治事务，那么，因为两国政府解决问题的手段是一样的，所以两国均无须担心对方会发动进攻，也就均无须采取先发制人的防卫行动。以此类推，双方都不会掉进霍布斯陷阱。比如说，今天的瑞典人不会为了担忧他们的邻居正在酝酿什么“挪威高于一切”的计划而夜不能寐；反之亦然，挪威人对瑞典人也没有这样的忧虑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The third condition for perpetual peace is "universal hospitality" or "world citizenship." People from one country should be free to live in safety in others, as long as they don't bring an army in with them. The hope is that communication, trade, and other "peaceable relations" across national boundaries will knit the world's people into a single community, so that a "violation of rights in one place is felt throughout the world."</div>

<div class="line_en">Obviously the satirists' deglorification of war and Kant's practical ideas on how to reduce it did not catch on widely enough to spare Western civilization the catastrophes of the next century and a half. But as we shall see, they planted the seeds of a movement that would blossom later and turn the world away from war. The new attitudes had an immediate impact as well. Historians have noted a change in the attitudes to war beginning around 1700. Leaders began to profess their love of peace and to claim that war had been forced upon them. As Mueller notes, "No longer was it possible simply and honestly to proclaim like Julius Caesar, 'I came, I saw, I conquered.' Gradually this was changed to 'I came, I saw, he attacked me while I was just standing there looking, I won.' This might be seen as progress."</div>

<div class="line_en">More tangible progress was seen in the dwindling appeal of imperial power. In the 18th century some of the world's most bellicose nations, such as the Netherlands, Sweden, Spain, Denmark, and Portugal, reacted to military disappointments not by doubling down and plotting a return to glory but by dropping out of the conquest game, leaving war and empire to other countries and becoming commercial nations instead. One of the results, as we shall see in the next chapter, was that wars between great powers became shorter, less frequent, and limited to fewer countries (though the advance of military organization meant that the wars that did occur were more damaging).</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对许多国家来说，帝国权威不再具有吸引力了，这是一个更切实的进步。18世纪，世界上一些最好战的国家，比如荷兰、瑞典、西班牙、丹麦和葡萄牙，它们面对战事失利，不是扩张军备，计划反攻夺回胜利，而是退出征战的游戏，把战争和帝国甩给其他国家，自己埋头于商业贸易。我们将在下一章看到这个变化带来的一个后果，大国之间的战争时间变短了，频率降低了，参与的国家也减少了（虽然军事组织的进步意味着战争更具破坏性了）。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And the greatest progress was yet to come. The extraordinary decline of major war in the last sixty years may be a delayed vindication of the ivory-tower theories of Immanuel Kant -- if not "perpetual peace," then certainly a "long peace," and one that keeps getting longer. As the great thinkers of the Enlightenment predicted, we owe this peace not just to the belittling of war but to the spread of democracy, the expansion of trade and commerce, and the growth of international organizations.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最伟大的进步尚未到来。过去60年来大规模战争数目的惊人减少，也许就是对康德象牙塔理论的迟到的验证——如果现在还不是“永久和平”的话，也肯定是一个“长期和平”，而且是越来越长的长期和平。正如启蒙时代的伟大思想家所预示的那样，我们能够得到这个和平，不仅是因为唾弃战争，而且是因为民主的传播、贸易和商业的扩张，以及国际组织的成长。">查看中文翻译</div>
