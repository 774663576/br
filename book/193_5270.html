<div class="line_en">Vittoria Vetra stumbled forward, almost falling into the retina scan. She sensed the American rushing to help her, holding her, supporting her weight. On the floor at her feet, her father's eyeball stared up. She felt the air crushed from her lungs. They cut out his eye! Her world twisted. Kohler pressed close behind, speaking. Langdon guided her. As if in a dream, she found herself gazing into the retina scan. The mechanism beeped.</div>

<div class="line_en">The canister was gone. They had cut out her father's eye to steal it. The implications came too fast for her to fully comprehend. Everything had backfired.

<div class="line_en">"Mr. Langdon?" Kohler's face was expressionless. He motioned Langdon out of earshot. Langdon reluctantly followed, leaving Vittoria to fend for herself. "You're the specialist," Kohler said, his whisper intense. "I want to know what these Illuminati bastards intend to do with this antimatter."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「兰登先生？」寇勒的脸毫无表情。他示意兰登到旁边私下谈。兰登不情愿地照办了，撇下了薇多利雅一个人面对眼前状况。「你是专家，」寇勒用气音小声说，听起来很紧张，「我想知道这些光明会混蛋拿了反物质会打算做什麽。」">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Langdon tried to focus. Despite the madness around him, his first reaction was logical. Academic rejection. Kohler was still making assumptions. Impossible assumptions. "The Illuminati are defunct, Mr. Kohler. I stand by that. This crime could be anything -- maybe even another CERN employee who found out about Mr. Vetra's breakthrough and thought the project was too dangerous to continue."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登努力让自己专心。儘管四周一片混乱，但他的第一个反应是合理的。学者的排斥。寇勒还在继续假设，但那些根本是不可能的。「寇勒先生，我还是坚持，光明会现在已经不存在了。这桩犯罪事件有各种可能──甚至可能是另一个欧洲核子研究中心的员工发现了威特拉先生的大突破，认为这个研究计画太过危险，不应该继续下去。」">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Kohler looked stunned. "You think this is a crime of conscience, Mr. Langdon? Absurd. Whoever killed Leonardo wanted one thing -- the antimatter specimen. And no doubt they have plans for it."</div>

<div class="line_en">Langdon didn't know what else to do. He took his handkerchief and lay it on the floor over Leonardo Vetra's eyeball.

<div class="line_en">Again, Langdon forced himself to consider the implausible. If the Illuminati were still active, and if they stole the antimatter, what would be their intention? What would be their target? The answer furnished by his brain was instantaneous. Langdon dismissed it just as fast. True, the Illuminati had an obvious enemy, but a wide-scale terrorist attack against that enemy was inconceivable. It was entirely out of character. Yes, the Illuminati had killed people, but individuals, carefully conscripted targets. Mass destruction was somehow heavy -- handed. Langdon paused. Then again, he thought, there would be a rather majestic eloquence to it -- antimatter, the ultimate scientific achievement, being used to vaporize --</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="再一次，兰登逼自己想想这件不可能的事。如果光明会还在活动，而且他们偷走了反物质，那麽他们的动机会是什麽？他们的目标又是什麽？一个答案瞬间浮现在他脑海，但又随即被丢开。没错，光明会的确有个明显的敌人，但很难想像他们会对这个敌人展开大规模的恐怖攻击。那完全不是光明会的作风。的确，光明会杀过人，但都是针对个人，目标都经过精挑细选。大规模的毁灭行动是有些下手太重了。兰登停了一下，然后又想，光明会对反物质一定会有个比较冠冕堂皇的说法──反物质这项最高的科学成就，用来毁灭──">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But the Illuminati were not terrorists."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「可是光明会并不是恐怖份子啊。」">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="「你认为这是恐怖份子的手段？」">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Langdon felt a pang of truth in the statement. Leonardo Vetra had indeed been branded with the Illuminati symbol. Where had it come from? The sacred brand seemed too difficult a hoax for someone trying to cover his tracks by casting suspicion elsewhere. There had to be another explanation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登从这句话中体会到一个痛苦的事实。李欧纳度的确被烙印上光明会的符号。符号是哪儿来的？那个神圣的标记太难设计了，似乎不太可能是某个人为了想隐藏身分而嫁祸他人的骗局。一定有别的解释。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Not the specimen," Langdon countered. "The technology. Antimatter technology must be worth a mint. Maybe someone stole the specimen to do analysis and R and D."</div>

<div class="line_en">Langdon tried to sort out the thought. The Illuminati had always wielded tremendous power through financial means. They controlled banks. They owned gold bullion. They were even rumored to possess the single most valuable gem on earth -- the Illuminati Diamond, a flawless diamond of enormous proportions. "Money," Langdon said. "The antimatter could have been stolen for financial gain."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登努力整理思绪。光明会在金融方面向来拥有巨大的影响力。他们控制银行，拥有很多金块。甚至有谣言说，他们拥有全世界最珍贵的宝石──「光明会钻石」，那是一颗很大的、完美无瑕的钻石。「钱。」兰登说。「反物质被偷，有可能是因为财务的利益。」">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="兰登皱起眉头。他明白薇多利雅和寇勒的意思了。反物质陷阱不是可以随便找个墙上的插座插上就算了的。一旦从欧洲核子研究中心取走，那个罐子就一去不回，踏上了为时二十四小时的毁灭之旅。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Vittoria had told no one. That left only two explanations. Either her father had taken someone into his confidence without telling her, which made no sense because it was her father who had sworn them both to secrecy, or she and her father had been monitored. The cell phone maybe? She knew they had spoken a few times while Vittoria was traveling. Had they said too much? It was possible. There was also their E-mail. But they had been discreet, hadn't they?
