<div class="line_en">The trends have a few things in common. In each case they had to swim against powerful currents of human nature. These include the dehumanization and demonization of out-groups; men's sexual rapacity and their proprietary sentiments toward women; manifestations of parent-offspring conflict such as infanticide and corporal punishment; the moralization of sexual disgust in homophobia; and our meat hunger, thrill of the hunt, and boundaries of empathy based on kinship, reciprocity, and charisma.</div>

<div class="line_en">As if biology didn't make things bad enough, the Abrahamic religions ratified some of our worst instincts with laws and beliefs that have encouraged violence for millennia: the demonization of infidels, the ownership of women, the sinfulness of children, the abomination of homosexuality, the dominion over animals and denial to them of souls. Asian cultures have plenty to be ashamed of too, particularly the mass disowning of daughters that encouraged a holocaust of baby girls. And then there is the entrenchment of norms: beating wives, smacking children, confining calves, and shocking rats were acceptable because everyone had always treated them as acceptable.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果生物的属性还不够糟糕，亚伯拉罕诸教还将我们这些最糟糕的天性以戒律和信仰的形式规范化了，并在上千年的时间里一直鼓动着暴力——妖魔化异教徒，确立对女性的占有权，认定儿童天生有罪，憎恶同性恋，支配动物并拒绝承认它们有灵性。亚洲的文化也有不少耻辱之处，最耻辱的当属大规模抛弃女儿，导致对女婴的屠杀。此外，还有各种根深蒂固的习俗：殴打妻子，痛揍孩子，夹栏饲养，电击老鼠。这些准则被人们接受，是因为每个人都认为它们从来就是被接受的。">查看中文翻译</div>

But I had no idea that in every case, quantifiable measures of violence -- hate crimes and rape, wife-beating and child abuse, even the number of motion pictures in which animals were harmed -- would all point downward. How can we make sense of all the movements toward nonviolence of the past fifty years?</div>

<div class="line_en">This conclusion, of course, is the moral vision of the Enlightenment and the strands of humanism and liberalism that have grown out of it. The Rights Revolutions are liberal revolutions. Each has been associated with liberal movements, and each is currently distributed along a gradient that runs, more or less, from Western Europe to the blue American states to the red American states to the democracies of Latin America and Asia and then to the more authoritarian countries, with Africa and most of the Islamic world pulling up the rear. In every case, the movements have left Western cultures with excesses of propriety and taboo that are deservedly ridiculed as political correctness. But the numbers show that the movements have reduced many causes of death and suffering and have made the culture increasingly intolerant of violence in any form.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我的结论是，启蒙运动的道德观，及其所培育的人文主义和自由主义潮流是权利革命的源泉。权利革命也就是自由主义革命。每一场权利革命都和自由主义运动密切相连，每一场自由主义运动几乎都是从欧洲发源，经过美国蓝色自由州，传递到美国红色保守州，再传向拉美和亚洲的民主国家，接着进入集权国家、非洲国家，最后是伊斯兰世界。每一场权利革命都在西方文化中留下太多的新避讳和新禁忌，人们调侃地称其为“政治正确”。但是，数字显示，权利运动减少了许多死亡和苦难，同时让人们的新文化越来越不能容忍暴力，无论是何种形式的暴力。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Insofar as violence is immoral, the Rights Revolutions show that a moral way of life often requires a decisive rejection of instinct, culture, religion, and standard practice. In their place is an ethics that is inspired by empathy and reason and stated in the language of rights. We force ourselves into the shoes (or paws) of other sentient beings and consider their interests, starting with their interest in not being hurt or killed, and we ignore superficialities that may catch our eye such as race, ethnicity, gender, age, sexual orientation, and to some extent, species.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就暴力的不道德性而言，权利革命显示，道德的生活方式经常需要坚定地否定直觉、文化、宗教和常规。在追求道德的人中，道德准则受移情和理性的引导，并以权利的语言加以陈述。我们迫使自己设身处地为其他有感知的生命着想，穿上他们的鞋子（或者它们的爪子），设想如何免受伤害或杀戮，我们不再关注那些表面的事物，比如眼睛所看到的种族、民族、性别、年龄、性取向，甚至在某种程度上，还有物种。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">To hear the liberal punditry talk, one would think that the United States has been hurtling rightward for more than forty years, from Nixon to Reagan to Gingrich to the Bushes and now the angry white men in the Tea Party movement. Yet in every issue touched by the Rights Revolutions -- interracial marriage, the empowerment of women, the tolerance of homosexuality, the punishment of children, and the treatment of animals -- the attitudes of conservatives have followed the trajectory of liberals, with the result that today's conservatives are more liberal than yesterday's liberals. As the conservative historian George Nash points out, "In practice if not quite in theory American conservatism today stands well to the left of where it stood in 1980." (Maybe that's why the men are so angry.)</div>

<div class="line_en">Democratic government obviously played a role. The Rights Revolutions took place in democracies, which are constituted as social contracts among individuals designed to reduce violence among them; as such they contain the seeds of expansion to groups that originally had been overlooked. But the timing remains a puzzle, because democracy is not an entirely exogenous variable. It was the machinery of democracy itself that was at issue during the American civil rights movement, when the political disenfranchisement of blacks was remedied. In the other revolutions too, new groups were invited or argued their way into full partnership in the social contract. Only then could the government be empowered to police violence (or cease its own violence) against members of the affected groups.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="民主政府显然发挥了它的作用。权利革命都发生在民主国家，公民以社会契约约束他们之中的暴力，民主制度本身包含着一种内在的机制，让社会契约可以向原来被排斥的团体伸延。但是，时机仍然是说不清楚的谜，因为民主本身不是一个全然外生的变量。当美国黑人在民权运动中夺回被剥夺的公民权利时，美国民主制度本身就是争议的对象。其他权利革命也有同样经历，新团体被接纳或者经过自己的努力争取成为社会契约中的正式成员，只有这时，政府才真正得到授权监管（或放弃）针对某些社会成员的暴力。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The postwar years saw an expansion of prosperity, but prosperity has such a diffuse influence on a society that it offers little insight into the revolutions' immediate triggers. Money can buy education, police, social science, social services, media penetration, a professional workforce with more women, and better care of children and animals. It's hard to identify which of these made a difference, and even if we could, it would raise the question of why society chose to distribute its surplus among these various goods in such a way as to reduce harm to vulnerable populations. And though I know of no rigorous statistical analysis, I can discern no correlations between the timing of the various upswings in the consideration of rights from the 1960s to the 2000s and the economic booms and recessions of those decades.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="战后出现了长期的经济繁荣，不过繁荣对社会的影响是弥散式的，从中找不到任何触发革命的直接动因。钱可以买到教育、警察、社会科学、社会服务、媒体覆盖、有妇女参加的专业劳动大军，以及对儿童和动物更周到的关照，我们无法确定这中间到底哪个因素导致了变化，而且，即使能够确定某个因素，我们仍然无法回答为什么社会选择了这样的资源分配方式来保护弱势群体免受伤害。虽然我无法提供严谨的统计分析，我还是认为，从20世纪60年代直到21世纪的头10年间，各种权利扩张的时间表与同时期的经济增长和衰退没有相关性。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">During the Rights Revolutions, networks of reciprocity and trade had expanded with the shift from an economy based on stuff to one based on information. Women were less enslaved by domestic chores, and institutions sought talent from a wide pool of human capital rather than just from the local labor supply or old boys' club. As women and members of minority groups were drawn into the wheelings and dealings of government and commerce, they ensured that their interests were factored into their workings. We have seen some evidence for this mechanism: countries with more women in government and the professions have less domestic violence against women, and people who know gay people personally are less likely to disapprove of homosexuality. But as with democracy, the inclusiveness of institutions is not a completely exogenous process. The hidden hand of an information economy may have made institutions more receptive to women, minorities, and gays, but it still took government muscle in the form of antidiscrimination laws to integrate them fully. And in the case of children and animals, there was no market for reciprocal exchanges at all: the beneficence went in one direction.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在权利革命期间，互惠和贸易网络不断扩张，并实现了从实物经济向信息经济的转变。妇女的家务负担减轻了，社会需要更加多样和丰富的人力资本，而不仅仅是本地人工或者传统势力集团的成员。当妇女和少数族裔进入政府机构和商业领域，他们就会让自己的利益带入自己日常的工作。我们已经看到这一机制的实例：一个国家的政府和专业机构中任职的妇女人数越多，这个国家针对妇女的家庭暴力就越少；而与同性恋有私交的人较少反对同性恋。但是，正如民主一样，制度的包容性也不是完全的外生过程。信息经济隐藏的手可能是一种让机构更愿意接纳妇女、少数族裔和同性恋者的力量，当然，政府仍然要通过消除歧视的立法彻底完成转变。在儿童和动物福利的问题上，完全没有交换互利的市场：受益人完全是单方面的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">If I were to put my money on the single most important exogenous cause of the Rights Revolutions, it would be the technologies that made ideas and people increasingly mobile. The decades of the Rights Revolutions were the decades of the electronics revolutions: television, transistor radios, cable, satellite, long-distance telephones, photocopiers, fax machines, the Internet, cell phones, text messaging, Web video. They were the decades of the interstate highway, high-speed rail, and the jet airplane. They were the decades of the unprecedented growth in higher education and in the endless frontier of scientific research.

<div class="line_en">Another causal pathway is an increase in invitations to adopt the viewpoints of people unlike oneself. The Humanitarian Revolution had its Clarissa, Pamela, and Julie, its Uncle Tom's Cabin and Oliver Twist, its eyewitness reports of people being broken, burned, or flogged. During the electronic age, these empathy technologies were even more pervasive and engaging. African Americans and gay people appeared as entertainers on variety shows, then as guests on talk shows and as sympathetic characters on sitcoms and dramas. Their struggles were depicted in real-time footage of fire hoses and police dogs, and in bestselling books and plays like Travels with Charley, A Raisin in the Sun, and To Kill a Mockingbird. Telegenic feminists made their case on talk shows, and their views came out of the mouths of characters in soap operas and sitcoms.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="另外一个因果路径是，鼓励人们转换视角，从与自己不同的人的角度观察世界。人道主义革命有自己的《克拉丽莎》《帕米拉》和《茱丽》，有它的《汤姆叔叔的小屋》和《雾都孤儿》，还有目击者对人们被殴打、火刑和鞭笞的报告。在电子时代，移情的技术更普及，也更能打动人心。美国非裔和美国同性恋者先是活跃在各种娱乐节目中，接着他们做访谈节目的嘉宾，然后是出演电视剧和电影中令人同情的角色。不仅纪录片，还有畅销小说和改编的电影《携犬横越美国》、《阳光下的葡萄干》（A Raisin in the Sun）、《杀死一只知更鸟》都记载了他们在与警察的水龙和警犬对峙下的抗争。电视时代的女权主义者，不仅作为女主持人，还作为电视剧中的女主人公大声宣扬自己的理念。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Why should the spread of ideas and people result in reforms that lower violence? There are several pathways. The most obvious is a debunking of ignorance and superstition. A connected and educated populace, at least in aggregate and over the long run, is bound to be disabused of poisonous beliefs, such as that members of other races and ethnicities are innately avaricious or perfidious; that economic and military misfortunes are caused by the treachery of ethnic minorities; that women don't mind being raped; that children must be beaten to be socialized; that people choose to be homosexual as part of a morally degenerate lifestyle; that animals are incapable of feeling pain. The recent debunking of beliefs that invite or tolerate violence call to mind Voltaire's quip that those who can make you believe absurdities can make you commit atrocities.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="为什么思想和人员的传播会带来降低暴力的变革？有这样几条路径。最显而易见的是，思想和人员的传播暴露无知与迷信。交往密切且受过良好教育的大众，至少在整体上和长期趋势上，不会受到有害信仰的蛊惑，比如相信其他种族或民族的人天生贪婪和背信弃义，相信少数族裔的叛变造成了经济和军事的困境，相信妇女不介意被强奸，相信儿童只有在棍棒下才能学会规矩，相信有人选择腐败的生活方式因此成为同性恋者，还有就是相信动物是不会感到疼痛的。伏尔泰说过，那些能够让你相信谬误的人，也能让你犯下暴行。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And as we will see in chapter 9, it is not just the virtual reality experience of seeing the world through another person's eyes that expands empathy and concern. It is also an intellectual agility -- literally a kind of intelligence -- which encourages one to step outside the parochial constraints of one's birth and station, to consider hypothetical worlds, and to reflect back on the habits, impulses, and institutions that govern one's beliefs and values. This reflective mindset may be a product of enhanced education, and it may also be a product of electronic media. As Paul Simon marveled:</div>

<div class="line_en">There is a third way that a flow of information can fertilize moral growth. Scholars who have puzzled over the trajectory of material progress in different parts of the world, such as the economist Thomas Sowell in his Culture trilogy and the physiologist Jared Diamond in Guns, Germs, and Steel, have concluded that the key to material success is being situated in a large catchment area of innovations. No one is smart enough to invent anything in isolation that anyone else would want to use. Successful innovators not only stand on the shoulders of giants; they engage in massive intellectual property theft, skimming ideas from a vast watershed of tributaries flowing their way. The civilizations of Europe and western Asia conquered the world because their migration and shipping routes allowed traders and conquerors to leave behind inventions that had originated anywhere in the vast Eurasian landmass: cereal crops and alphabetic writing from the Middle East, gunpowder and paper from China, domesticated horses from Ukraine, oceangoing navigation from Portugal, and much else. There is a reason that the literal meaning of cosmopolitan is "citizen of the world," and the literal meaning of insular is "of an island." Societies that are marooned on islands or in impassable highlands tend to be technologically backward. And morally backward too. We have seen that cultures of honor, whose overriding ethic is tribal loyalty and blood revenge, can survive in mountainous regions long after their lowland neighbors have undergone a civilizing process.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第三条路径是可以促进道德提升的信息流。有些学者研究过世界不同地区物质进步的趋势，比如三卷本《文化》（Culture）的作者，经济学家托马斯·索厄尔和《枪炮、病菌和钢铁》（Guns， Germs， and Steel）的作者、生物学家贾里德·戴蒙德（Jared Diamond），他们都得出结论说，物质进步的关键在于它需要大量的创新为依托。还没有人聪明到能够在完全的孤独中发明一种让其他人都喜爱的东西。成功的创新不仅站在巨人的肩膀上，而且创新者还参与大规模的知识产权盗窃，从丰沛的思想水系中汲取各种养料。欧洲和西亚的文明能够征服世界，是因为移民和航海让商人和征服者把发明和创新从原产地带到欧亚大陆的各个角落，这些技术和创新有来自中东的谷物和拼音文字，来自中国的火药和造纸，来自乌克兰的良种马，还有葡萄牙的航海技术，等等等等。Cosmopolitan（世界性）的意思是“世界公民”，而insular（孤独）的意思就是“岛国小民”，这都是有原因的。困守孤岛或者交通不便的山区社会往往不仅技术落后，道德观念也落后。我们前面已经看到，在低地的居民已经开始文明进程的时候，山民们仍然保守着荣誉文化，也就是说将对部落的忠诚和家族复仇作为最高伦理。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In his 1963 essay "Pilgrimage to Nonviolence," Martin Luther King recounted the intellectual threads that he wove into his political philosophy. As a graduate student in theology in the late 1940s and early 1950s, he was, of course, conversant with the Bible and orthodox theology. But he also read renegade theologians such as Walter Rauschenbusch, who criticized the historical accuracy of the Bible and the dogma that Jesus died for people's sins.</div>

<div class="line_en">King then embarked on "a serious study of the social and ethical theories of the great philosophers, from Plato and Aristotle down to Rousseau, Hobbes, Bentham, Mill, and Locke. All of these masters stimulated my thinking -- such as it was -- and, while finding things to question in each of them, I nevertheless learned a great deal from their study." He carefully read (and rejected) Nietzsche and Marx, inoculating himself against the autocratic and communist ideologies that would be so seductive to other liberation movements. He also rejected the "anti-rationalism of the continental theologian Karl Barth," while admiring Reinhold Niebuhr's "extraordinary insight into human nature, especially the behavior of nations and social groups… These elements in Niebuhr's thinking helped me to recognize the illusions of a superficial optimism concerning human nature and the dangers of a false idealism."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="金赶赴费城聆听了霍华德大学校长莫迪凯·约翰逊（Mordecai Johnson）的讲座，自此，他的思想发生了不可逆转的变化。约翰逊刚刚结束了一次印度之行，他谈起了领导印度独立运动的莫罕达斯·甘地。金写道：“他的道理如此深刻和令人振奋，我离开聚会后立即买了几本关于甘地生平的书。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">King immediately appreciated that Gandhi's theory of nonviolent resistance was not a moralistic affirmation of love, as nonviolence had been in the teachings of Jesus. Instead it was a set of hardheaded tactics to prevail over an adversary by outwitting him rather than trying to annihilate him. A taboo on violence, King inferred, prevents a movement from being corrupted by thugs and firebrands who are drawn to adventure and mayhem. It preserves morale and focus among followers when the movement suffers early defeats. By removing any pretext for legitimate retaliation by the enemy, it stays on the positive side of the moral ledger in the eyes of third parties, while luring the enemy onto the negative side. For the same reason, it divides the enemy, paring away supporters who find it increasingly uncomfortable to identify themselves with one-sided violence. All the while it can press its agenda by making a nuisance of itself with sit-ins, strikes, and demonstrations. The tactic obviously won't work with all enemies, but it can work with some.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="金立刻认识到，与耶稣教义中一贯宣扬的非暴力不同，甘地的非暴力抵抗理论不是要对爱做道德肯定。相反，这是一套顽强的战略战术，是要通过更高的智慧战胜敌人，而不是要在肉体上消灭敌人。金得出结论，对暴力的禁忌可以防止运动被冒险家和暴徒所侵蚀。在运动初期遭受挫折的时候，暴力禁忌可以维持成员的士气和关注点。反对暴力，让敌人失去攻击的合理性，让自己在第三方眼中保持积极的道德优势，同时让敌人处于劣势。出于同样理由，非暴力抵抗分裂敌人，让一些敌人的支持者对单边暴力越来越反感。而运动本身可以通过静坐、罢工和示威等制造麻烦，争取自己的目标。这种战术当然不能用来对付所有的敌人，但显然对其中某些是有效的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">King's historic speech to the March on Washington in 1963 was an ingenious recombination of the intellectual components he had collected during his peripatetic pilgrimage: imagery and language from the Hebrew prophets, the valorization of suffering from Christianity, the ideal of individual rights from the European Enlightenment, cadences and rhetorical tropes from the African American church, and a strategic plan from an Indian who had been steeped in Jain, Hindu, and British culture.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="1963年，金在华盛顿大游行上所做的历史性演讲，是对他在朝圣之旅中积累的各种智慧的集大成者：有希伯来先知的想象和语汇，有基督教承担苦难的勇气，有欧洲启蒙运动个人权利的理想，有美国黑人教会的韵律和修辞，还有来自一个浸润了耆那教、印度教和英国文化的印度人的战略规划。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It is not too lazy to say that the rest is history. The moral contrivance assembled by King was thrown back into the idea pool, there to be adapted by the entrepreneurs of the other rights movements. They consciously appropriated its name, its moral rationale, and significantly, many of its tactics.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="毋庸赘言，过去已经成为历史。金组装的道德装置也成为人类思想库中的瑰宝，不断成为其他权利运动的工具。后来者自觉地高举非暴力的大旗和道德理性，并学习金的各种战略战术。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">By the standards of history, a striking feature of the late-20th-century Rights Revolutions is how little violence they employed or even provoked. King himself was a martyr of the civil rights movement, as were the handful of victims of segregationist terrorism. But the urban riots that we associate with the 1960s were not a part of the civil rights movement and erupted after most of its milestones were in place. The other revolutions had hardly any violence at all: there was the nonlethal Stonewall riot, some terrorism from the fringes of the animal rights movement, and that's about it. Their entrepreneurs wrote books, gave speeches, held marches, lobbied legislators, and gathered signatures for plebiscites. They had only to nudge a populace that had become receptive to an ethic based on the rights of individuals and were increasingly repelled by violence in any form. Compare this record to that of earlier movements which ended despotism, slavery, and colonial empires only after bloodbaths that killed 以历史的标准来看,20世纪后期权利运动最显著的特征就是它所使用和所引起的暴力都非常之少.金自己成为民权运动的烈士,是种族隔离分子恐怖行动的少数受害人之一.我们谈到的20世纪60年代美国城市发生的暴动事件都与民权运动无关,它们是在民权运动已经取得历史性进展之后的事情.其他社会革命的暴力成分非常有限:(同性恋夜总会的)"石墙骚乱"没有人员伤亡,动物权利运动中有些极端分子采用了恐怖手段,仅此而已.后期权利运动的推动者们出版书籍,发表演讲,组织游行,游说议员,为公投收集签名.公众早已接受以个人权利为基础的道德准则,而且越来越排斥任何形式的暴力,权利运动所需要的只剩下发动公众.相比之下,推翻专制政治、结束奴隶制和殖民统治的早期权利运动,无一不经过死伤几十万甚至上百万的血腥战斗.</div>
