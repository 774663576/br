But he is only one, and he is easily dealt with." As she spoke these words she rose from her seat and looked Edmund full in the face, her eyes flaming; at the same moment she raised her wand. Edmund felt sure that she was going to do something dreadful but he seemed unable to move. Then, just as he gave himself up for lost, she appeared to change her mind.</div>

<div class="line_en">Edmund did not like this arrangement at all but he dared not disobey; he stepped on to the sledge and sat at her feet, and she put a fold of her fur mantle round him and tucked it well in.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱德蒙内心不愿意，但又不敢违抗，他只好跨上雪橇，坐在她脚旁。她把毛皮披风的一角披在他身上，将他裹的紧紧的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes please, your Majesty," said Edmund, whose teeth were chattering.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“谢谢，陛下。”爱德蒙说，他的牙齿在不停地打战。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Perhaps something hot to drink?" said the Queen. "Should you like that?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你想喝点什么热的东西吗？”女王问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"My poor child," she said in quite a different voice, "how cold you look! Come and sit with me here on the sledge and I will put my mantle round you and we will talk."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我可怜的孩子，”她说话的腔调变得不同了，“瞧，你被冻得这个样子！坐到我雪橇上来吧，我给你裹上披风，好一起谈谈心。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Queen took from somewhere among her wrappings a very small bottle which looked as if it were made of copper. Then, holding out her arm, she let one drop fall from it on the snow beside the sledge. Edmund saw the drop for a second in mid-air, shining like a diamond. But the moment it touched the snow there was a hissing sound and there stood a jewelled cup full of something that steamed. The dwarf immediately took this and handed it to Edmund with a bow and a smile; not a very nice smile. Edmund felt much better as he began to sip the hot drink. It was something he had never tasted before, very sweet and foamy and creamy, and it warmed him right down to his toes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="女王从身边掏出一个很小的瓶子，它看上去是铜做的。然后，她伸出手臂，从瓶里倒出一滴东西滴在雪橇旁边的雪地上。爱德蒙看到，这一滴东西在落地前像宝石一样闪闪发光，但它一碰到雪，便发出一阵咝咝的响声，顿时就变成了一个宝石杯，杯子里盛满了饮料，还直冒热气。那个小妖马上拿起杯子，递给爱德蒙，皮笑肉不笑地向他鞠了一个躬。爱德蒙呷了一口，感到舒服多了。这是他从没尝到过的奶油饮料，非常甜，泡沫很多，他喝下以后，一直暖到脚跟。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">While he was eating the Queen kept asking him questions. At first Edmund tried to remember that it is rude to speak with one's mouth full, but soon he forgot about this and thought only of trying to shovel down as much Turkish Delight as he could, and the more he ate the more he wanted to eat, and he never asked himself why the Queen should be so inquisitive. She got him to tell her that he had one brother and two sisters, and that one of his sisters had already been in Narnia and had met a Faun there, and that no one except himself and his brother and his sisters knew anything about Narnia. She seemed especially interested in the fact that there were four of them, and kept on coming back to it. "You are sure there are just four of you?" she asked. "Two Sons of Adam and two Daughters of Eve, neither more nor less?" and Edmund, with his mouth full of Turkish Delight, kept on saying, "Yes, I told you that before," and forgetting to call her "Your Majesty", but she didn't seem to mind now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在他吃软糖的时候，女王接二连三地问了他许多问题。开始，爱德蒙竭力让自己记住，嘴里塞满了东西讲话是不礼貌的，但没有多久他就忘得干干净净，只顾狼吞虎咽地吃软糖。他吃得越多，就越是想吃，一点儿也没想到为什么女王要问他这么多问题。最后，他把一切情况都告诉了她：他有一个哥哥，一个姐姐和一个妹妹，他的妹妹也曾到过那尼亚，还遇见了一个农牧之神，除了他们兄妹四人以外，没有谁知道那尼亚的情况。女王听到他们有兄妹四人，似乎感到特别有兴趣，她反反复复地问：“你能肯定你们正好是四个人吗？亚当的两个儿子和夏娃的两个女儿，不多也不少？”爱德蒙嘴里塞满了软糖，一遍又一遍地回答：“是的，我已经告诉过你了。”现在他都忘了称她“陛下”，但她好像并不在乎。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Queen let another drop fall from her bottle on to the snow, and instantly there appeared a round box, tied with green silk ribbon, which, when opened, turned out to contain several pounds of the best Turkish Delight. Each piece was sweet and light to the very centre and Edmund had never tasted anything more delicious. He was quite warm now, and very comfortable.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，女王又从瓶子里倒出一滴东西滴到雪地上，地上立即出现了一个圆盒子，用绿丝带扎着，把它一打开，里面装着好几磅最好的土耳其软糖。每一块又甜又软，爱德蒙从没有吃过比它还要好吃的东西。他现在感到非常暖和，非常舒适。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It is dull, Son of Adam, to drink without eating," said the Queen presently. "What would you like best to eat?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“亚当的儿子，只饮不吃是傻瓜，”女王过了一会儿说，“你最喜欢吃什么东西呀？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Why can't we go to your house now?" said Edmund. When he had first got on to the sledge he had been afraid that she might drive away with him to some unknown place from which he would not be able to get back; but he had forgotten about that fear now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那么我们现在就到你家里去好吗？”爱德蒙试探着问道。他刚坐上雪橇时，担心她会把他带到一个非常陌生的地方去，他将永远回不来了，可是现在，他的这种担心已被抛到了九霄云外。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我一定照办。”爱德蒙说，两只眼睛依旧盯住那只空盒子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At last the Turkish Delight was all finished and Edmund was looking very hard at the empty box and wishing that she would ask him whether he would like some more. Probably the Queen knew quite well what he was thinking; for she knew, though Edmund did not, that this was enchanted Turkish Delight and that anyone who had once tasted it would want more and more of it, and would even, if they were allowed, go on eating it till they killed themselves. But she did not offer him any more. Instead, she said to him,</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，土耳其软糖全吃完了，爱德蒙的眼睛滴溜溜地看着那个空盒子，巴不得她再问他一声是不是还想吃。女王很可能知道他此时的思想活动。因为，爱德蒙虽然没有说出口，但她却十分清楚，这种土耳其软糖是一种施了妖法的迷魂糖，不管哪个吃了以后，都会越吃越想吃，只要有得吃，他就不会住口，一直吃到被毒死为止。女王并没有再给他吃，只是说：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Because, if you did come again -- bringing them with you of course -- I'd be able to give you some more Turkish Delight. I can't do it now, the magic will only work once. In my own house it would be another matter."</div>

I want a nice boy whom I could bring up as a Prince and who would be King of Narnia when I am gone. While he was Prince he would wear a gold crown and eat Turkish Delight all day long; and you are much the cleverest and handsomest young man I've ever met. I think I would like to make you the Prince -- some day, when you bring the others to visit me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我家是个很舒适的地方。”女王说，“我肯定你会喜欢，那里有好些房间是专门放土耳其软糖的。再说，我自己没有孩子，我很想领一个漂亮的男孩当王子。你哪一天把另外三个人带到我家来，我就哪一天让你当王子。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Ah, but once you were in my house," said the Queen, "you might forget all about thern. You would be enjoying yourself so much that you wouldn't want the bother of going to fetch them. No. You must go back to your own country now and come to me another day, with them, you understand. It is no good coming without them."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不错，但是如果你现在到了我的家里，”女王说，“你就会把他们忘得干干净净，你就会只顾自己玩乐，而不想再去找他们了。不行！你现在必须回到你自己的国家去，过几天和他们一起到我这儿来，不和他们一起来是不行的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But I don't even know the way back to my own country," pleaded Edmund. "That's easy," answered the Queen. "Do you see that lamp?" She pointed with her wand and Edmund turned and saw the same lamp-post under which Lucy had met the Faun. "Straight on, beyond that, is the way to the World of Men. And now look the other way' -- here she pointed in the opposite direction -- "and tell me if you can see two little hills rising above the trees."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但我不认得回去的路。”爱德蒙恳求说。“这容易。”女王回答说，“你看见那盏灯吗？”她用手中的棍子指了指，爱德蒙转过身去，看见了露茜曾在那儿碰见了农牧之神的那个灯柱。“一直往前走，到灯柱那边，就能找到通向人世间的路，嗯，现在请你看另外一条路，”她指着相反的方向问，“顺着树梢的上头看过去，你看到有两座小山吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

Just bring them along to the two hills -- a clever boy like you will easily think of some excuse for doing that -- and when you come to my house you could just say "Let's see who lives here" or something like that. I am sure that would be best. If your sister has met one of the Fauns, she may have heard strange stories about me -- nasty stories that might make her afraid to come to me. Fauns will say anything, you know, and now --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嗯，顺便说一句，”女王说，“你不必把我的情况告诉他们。我们两人必须严守秘密，这将是非常有趣的事情，你说是不是？要让他们来了以后大吃一惊。你只要想办法把他们带进那两座小山就行了——一个像你这样聪明的孩子要找个这样的借口还不容易——你到了我家以后，只消说一声，‘让我们看看谁住在这儿’或别的这一类的话就行了。据我看来，这是再好不过的办法。如果你的妹妹见到过一个农牧之神，她或许听到过关于我的什么坏话。她可能怕到我这儿来。那些农牧之神最会瞎说一通，现在……”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes, let's," said Lucy. "Oh, Edmund, I am glad you've got in too. The others will have to believe in Narnia now that both of us have been there. What fun it will be!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“也好，”露茜说，“哦，爱德蒙，你也来了，我感到很高兴。我们两人都到过那尼亚，别人一定会相信我们了。那该多有趣呀！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But Edmund secretly thought that it would not be as good fun for him as for her. He would have to admit that Lucy had been right, before all the others, and he felt sure the others would all be on the side of the Fauns and the animals; but he was already more than half on the side of the Witch. He did not know what he would say, or how he would keep his secret once they were all talking about Narnia.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱德蒙却暗自认为，对他来说，那尼亚并不像露茜说的那样有趣，但是他不得不在大家面前承认露茜是对的。他敢肯定，别人都会站在农牧之神和别的动物一边，而他却站在女巫这一边。如果大家都知道那尼亚的情况，那他就有口难辨了，也无法保守他的秘密了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Edmund was already feeling uncomfortable from having eaten too many sweets, and when he heard that the Lady he had made friends with was a dangerous witch he felt even more uncomfortable. But he still wanted to taste that Turkish Delight again more than he wanted anything else.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱德蒙软糖吃得太多，早已感到不很舒服，现在听说和他交朋友的那个女人原来是个危险的女巫，他就感到更不舒服了。虽然如此，与别的东西相比，他还是喜欢吃土耳其软糖。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'm all right," said Edmund, but this was not true. He was feeling very sick.</div>

<div class="line_en">By this time they had walked a good way. Then suddenly they felt coats around them instead of branches and next moment they were both standing outside the wardrobe in the empty room.</div>
