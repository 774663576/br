<div class="line_en">They were only perceptible at first as the light is in the sky before the moon rises. Then they were steady of see across the ocean which was rough now with the increasing breeze. He steered inside of the glow and he thought that now, soon, he must hit the edge of the stream. Now it is over, he thought. They will probably hit me again. But what can a man do against them in the dark without a weapon? He was stiff and sore now and his wounds and all of the strained parts of his body hurt with the cold of the night.</div>

<div class="line_en">"You tried to buy it with eighty-four days at sea. They nearly sold it to you too." I must not think nonsense, he thought. Luck is a thing that comes in many forms and who can recognize her? I would take some thought in any form and pay what they asked. I wish I could see the glow from the lights, he thought. I wish too many things. But that is the thing I wish for now. He tried to settle more comfortably of steer and from his pain he knew he was not dead. He saw the reflected glare of the lights of the city at what must have been around ten o'clock at night.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「你曾试着用海上的八十四天来买，而几乎可说他们也卖给了你。」我千万不可胡思乱想，他心想。运气这种东西，可以许多不同的形态来临，谁又能认得出它来呢？不过无论它是什么形态，我都想买一些，而且不讨价还价。但愿我能看得到灯火的红光，他想。我所希望的事情太多了。但此刻仅有这一个愿望。他试着把自己安置得更舒服一点，以便把舵。从疼痛中他明白自己还没死。大概是晚上十点钟左右，他看见了城市的灯火所反映的亮光。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He jerked the tiller free from the rudder and beat an chopped with it, holding it in both hands and driving it down again and again. But they were up to the bow now and driving in one after the other and together, tearing off the pieces of meat that showed glowing below the sea as they turned to come once more. One came, finally, against the head itself and he knew that it was over. He swung the tiller across the shark's head where the jaws were caught in the heaviness of the fish's head which would not tear. He swung it once and twice and again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他把舵柄由舵上卸下，双手握着它，一次又一次地往下捶打鲨鱼。但是此刻它们已游向船头，一条接着一条，成群拥上来，撕扯大鱼的肉，一片片的肉在海中闪烁着光芒，然后它们转了一圈又再度回来。最后，过来一条鲨鱼来抢食鱼头，他知道一切都完了。他朝鲨鱼头挥舞着舵柄，鲨鱼的嘴咬住大鱼沉重的头，扯不动，也撕不下来，老人一次再一次地挥打。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I hope I do not have to fight again, he thought. I hope so much I do not have to fight again. But by midnight he fought and this time he knew the fight was useless. They came in a pack and he could only see the lines in the water that their fins made and their phosphorescence as they threw themselves on the fish. He clubbed at heads and heard the jaws chop and the shaking of the skiff as they took hold below. He clubbed desperately at what he could only feel and hear and he felt something seized the club and it was gone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他想，希望我不必再搏斗了，我殷切希望不必再搏斗了。但是到了午夜时分，他又开始搏斗了，而且他知道这次再怎么斗也没有用的。鲨鱼成群结队地来了，他只能看到它们的鳍在水中所划出的线，以及它们冲向大鱼时身上发出的磷光。他用棍子击打它们的头，听到它们嘴巴抢食的声音，感觉小船在它们由下咬住大鱼时摇摆不已。他仅靠感觉和听声音，拼命地打。他感觉有东西抓住了棍子，之后棍子就被拖走了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He heard the tiller break and he lunged at the shark with the splintered butt. He felt it go in and knowing it was sharp he drove it in again. The shark let go and rolled away. That was the last shark of the pack that came. There was nothing more for them to eat. The old man could hardly breathe now and he felt a strange taste in his mouth. It was coppery and sweet and he was afraid of it for a moment. But there was not much of it. He spat into the ocean and said, "Eat that, galanos. And make a dream you've killed a man."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他听到舵柄断裂的声音，但也只好举起断裂的舵柄朝鲨鱼戳刺。他感觉已刺进去了，而且他晓得舵柄仍然尖利，因此再往里面推去。鲨鱼松了嘴，翻滚下来。这是刚才蜂拥而至的鲨鱼中的最后一只。也已经没有什么东西可供它们吃了。老人这时几乎已喘不过气来，他感觉口中有奇水怪的味道。是黄铜的味道，甜甜的，这味道令他担心了一下。但是不严重就是了。他往海里吐了一口唾沫说：「吃吧！虎鲨，去做个梦吧，梦见你们杀死了一个人。」">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He knew he was beaten now finally and without remedy and he went back to the stern and found the jagged end of the tiller would fit in the slot of the rudder well enough for him to steer. He settled the sack around his shoulders and put the skiff on her course. He sailed lightly now and he had no thoughts nor any feelings of any kind. He was past everything now and he sailed the skiff to make his homeport as well and as intelligently as he could. In the night sharks hit the carcass as someone might pick up crumbs from the table.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在他知道，他终于被打败了，而且是一败涂地，他回到了船尾，发现那半截锯齿状的舵柄还可以安置在舵孔里，勉强可以操作航行。他把肩膀上的布袋整理好，将然将小船驶向航道。这时航行起来很轻便，他已无任何想法，亦无任何感觉，对任何事也不感兴趣了。他尽量保持清醒地驾着小船，朝家乡的港口回航。晚上，鲨鱼又来袭击大鱼的残骸，恰如有些人捡食饭桌下的面包屑一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And the great sea with our friends and our enemies. And bed, he thought. Bed is my friend. Just bed, he thought. Bed will be a great thing. It is easy when you are beaten, he thought. I never knew how easy it was. And what beat you, he thought. "Nothing," he said aloud. "I went out too far." When he sailed into the little harbour the lights of the Terrace were out and he knew everyone was in bed. The breeze had risen steadily and was blowing strongly now. It was quiet in the harbour though and he sailed up onto the little patch of shingle below the rocks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大海中有我们的朋友，也有我们的敌人。还有床，他想。床是我的朋友，只要有一张床就行了，他想。床真是件好东西。当你精疲力竭战败之时，床给你舒适安逸，他想。我从来不晓得，床到底有多舒适安逸。到底是什么将你打败，他想。「没有任何东西，」他大声地说。「是我自己出海太远了。」当他航进小港的时候，露天酒店的灯光已经熄灭，他晓得每一个人都已经上床就寝。风很稳定地加强中，愈吹愈猛烈，然而海湾里面一切平静，他航向岩石下面一堆砂砾的地方。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The old man paid no attention to them and did not pay any attention to anything except steering. He only noticed how lightly and how well the skiff sailed now there was no great weight beside her. She's good, he thought. She is sound and not harmed in any way except for the tiller. That is easily replaced. He could feel he was inside the current now and he could see the lights of the beach colonies along the shore. He knew where he was now and it was nothing to get home. The wind is our friend, anyway, he thought. Then he added, sometimes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="老人不再理会它们，除了航行以外，他对任何事情都漠不关心。他只注意到小船现在没有沉重的负荷了，它多么轻巧而顺利地航行着啊。他心想，这真是条好船。很结实，而且除了舵柄以外，一点损坏也没有，那个倒很容易更换。他可以感觉到他已经航进海潮里面来了，同时也可以看见沿着海岸旁边海滨住宅区的灯光。他现在知道自己正处于什么方位了，回家不成问题了。他想，不管怎么说，风总是我们的朋友。他又补充说，有时候是的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He started to climb again and at the top he fell and lay for some time with the mast across his shoulder. He tried to get up. But it was too difficult and he sat there with the mast on his shoulder and looked at the road. A cat passed on the far side going about its business and the old man watched it. Then he just watched the road. Finally he put the mast down and stood up. He picked the mast up and put it on his shoulder and started up the road. He had to sit down five times before he reached his shack.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他又继续往上爬，爬到顶上的时候，他摔了一跤，他扛着桅杆在地上休息了一会儿。他努力想要站起来。但对他来说实在太困难了，他坐在那里，肩膀上依旧扛着桅杆，望着路上。一只猫从远处走过，像是要去办自己的事，老人注视着它，然后又望着路。最后他把桅杆放下，站了起来。然后，再把桅杆扛在肩膀上，开始上路。在走到小木屋之前，他总共坐下来休息了五次。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was no one to help him so he pulled the boat up as far as he could. Then he stepped out and made her fast to a rock. He unstepped the mast and furled the sail and tied it. Then he shouldered the mast and started to climb. It was then he knew the depth of his tiredness. He stopped for a moment and looked back and saw in the reflection from the street light the great tail of the fish standing up well behind the skiff's stern. He saw the white naked line of his backbone and the dark mass of the head with the projecting bill and all the nakedness between.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没有人帮助他上岸，只有尽自己的能力，把船尽量地往上拖。然后，他走下船把船系在岩石上。他卸下桅杆，把帆卷起来捆好，然后扛在肩上，开始往小木屋的路上爬去。这个时候，他才体会到自己到底有多疲倦。他停下来一会儿，往后望去，由街灯的反光中，他看到那条大鱼的尾巴耸立在船尾后。他还看见它秃得像一条条白线的背脊骨，以及那一团黑漆漆的头骨和突出的嘴，其余都只有光光的躯壳骨架而已。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Inside the shack he leaned the mast against the wall. In the dark he found a water bottle and took a drink. Then he lay down on the bed. He pulled the blanket over his shoulders and then over his back and legs and he slept face down on the newspapers with his arms out straight and the palms of his hands up. He was asleep when the boy looked in the door in the morning. It was blowing so hard that the drifting-boats would not be going out and the boy had slept late and then come to the old man's shack as he had come each morning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他把桅杆靠在小木屋里的墙上。黑暗中他摸索到一个水瓶，喝了一口水后便倒在床上。他拉起毯子盖在肩膀上、背上和腿上。他脸朝下趴在报纸上，手肩直直地伸着，掌心朝上。早晨当小男孩从门口往里望的时候，他正熟睡着。风强烈地吹着，那些随风飘荡的小船都不出海，因此男孩也就晚一点才起床，就如每天早晨一样，他来到老人的小木屋里察看。">查看中文翻译</div>
