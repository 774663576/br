<div class="line_en">Far off, he could hear his packmates calling to him, like to like. They were hunting too. A wild rain lashed down upon his black brother as he tore at the flesh of an enormous goat, washing the blood from his side where the goat's long horn had raked him. In another place, his little sister lifted her head to sing to the moon, and a hundred small grey cousins broke off their hunt to sing with her. The hills were warmer where they were, and full of food. Many a night his sister's pack gorged on the flesh of sheep and cows and horses, the prey of men, and sometimes even on the flesh of man himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们也在狩猎。他的黑毛兄弟在飘风骤雨中撕食一头大山羊，体侧被长角划开一道沟槽；但雨水洗去了血迹。另一个地方，他的小妹正举头向月高歌，上百只体型较小的灰色亲族也暂停捕猎加入合唱。那边的丘陵地比此间更温暖，乐趣也更多。许多夜晚，她的群落饱餐牛、羊、马匹——人类的牲口；有时甚至是人本身。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The white wolf padded along the man trail beneath the icy cliff. The taste of blood was on his tongue, and his ears rang to the song of the hundred cousins. Once they had been six, five whimpering blind in the snow beside their dead mother, sucking cool milk from her hard dead nipples whilst he crawled off alone. Four remained… and one the white wolf could no longer sense.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="白狼循冰崖底下的人迹轻捷前行。血肉骨头的口感仿佛出自自己的齿颊，而上百亲族的歌唱萦绕在耳边。但他失去了一个兄弟：灰毛、带着阳光味道的那个。当初他们一胞六胎，五个闭着眼睛在死去的母亲身边啜泣；当他的小伙伴们从死去的奶头上吸取冷奶的时候，他——白毛的这一个，用颤抖的腿脚爬向树林。六个剩下四个，如今又有一个逝去无踪。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The white wolf ran from it, racing toward the cave of night where the sun had hidden, his breath frosting in the air. On starless nights the great cliff was as black as stone, a darkness towering high above the wide world, but when the moon came out it shimmered pale and icy as a frozen stream. The wolf's pelt was thick and shaggy, but when the wind blew along the ice no fur could keep the chill out. On the other side the wind was colder still, the wolf sensed. That was where his brother was, the grey brother who smelled of summer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="白狼逃离它，似一枝白箭飞越寒冰，奔向太阳落山的夜晚之地，一路呵气成霜。无星的夜里，这道巨崖深沉仿佛岩石，高高耸立的大片黑暗分割天地；但月出之后它又晶莹闪亮，如同冰冻的溪流。狼毛既厚重又蓬松，但当风沿着冰面吹来，什么毛皮也抵挡不住那种寒气。不过他还见识过更冷的风。那是早先通过他灰毛、带阳光味道的兄弟感受到的。">查看中文翻译</div>

Get your feathers out of my face." Jon wriggled an arm out from under his blankets to shoo the raven off. It was a big bird, old and bold and scruffy, utterly without fear. "Snow," it cried, flapping to his bedpost. "Snow, snow."</div>

The apples stewed with prunes are excellent, except for the prunes. I won't eat prunes myself. Well, there was one time when Hobb chopped them up with chestnuts and carrots and hid them in a hen. Never trust a cook, my lord. They'll prune you when you least expect it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“三粒玉米和烤乌鸦，”艾迪说。“很好，大人。可是今早哈布做了煮鸡蛋、黑香肠、梅干炖苹果。梅干炖苹果妙极了，当然梅干除外。我自己从来不吃梅干。唉，有一次哈布把这玩意剁碎了和栗子还有胡萝卜拌一起填在母鸡里。所以绝对不能相信厨子，你怕什么他就拿什么修理你。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Good." A thousand wildlings had been penned up beyond the Wall, the captives Stannis Baratheon had taken when his knights had smashed Mance Rayder's patchwork host. Many of the prisoners were women, and some of the guards had been sneaking them out to warm their beds. King's men, queen's men, it did not seem to matter; a few black brothers had tried the same thing. Men were men, and these were the only women for a thousand leagues.</div>

<div class="line_en">Burning dead children had ceased to trouble Jon Snow; live ones were another matter. Two kings to wake the dragon. The father first and then the son, so both die kings. The words had been murmured by one of the queen's men as Maester Aemon had cleaned his wounds. Jon had tried to dismiss them as his fever talking. Aemon had demurred. "There is power in a king's blood," the old maester had warned, "and better men than Stannis have done worse things than this." The king can be harsh and unforgiving, aye, but a babe still on the breast? Only a monster would give a living child to the flames.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="琼恩对火葬死孩子已然见惯不惊，但烧活孩子是另一码事。唤醒龙需要两个国王，他回忆起来，先爹后儿子，两个死国王。这些词语是在战斗结束后，伊蒙师傅为一个后党骑士清洗伤口时听他念叨出来的。听到转述的时候，琼恩震惊了。“发烧说胡话而已，”他当时说，但伊蒙师傅不同意。“国王之血蕴含力量，琼恩，”他提醒。“比史坦尼斯更好的人干过比这更坏的事。”国王可能严厉而苛刻，没错；但一个吃奶娃娃？把活生生的孩子送进火堆简直禽兽不如。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jon pissed in darkness, filling his chamber pot as the Old Bear's raven muttered complaints. The wolf dreams had been growing stronger, and he found himself remembering them even when awake. Ghost knows that Grey Wind is dead. Robb had died at the Twins, betrayed by men he'd believed his friends, and his wolf had perished with him. Bran and Rickon had been murdered too, beheaded at the behest of Theon Greyjoy, who had once been their lord father's ward… but if dreams did not lie, their direwolves had escaped. At Queenscrown, one had come out of the darkness to save Jon's life. Summer, it had to be. His fur was grey, and Shaggydog is black. He wondered if some part of his dead brothers lived on inside their wolves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="琼恩摸黑撒了泡尿。熊老的乌鸦在一边抱怨个不休。狼梦更清晰了，现在琼恩即使醒着也能够回忆起梦境。白灵知道灰风没了。罗柏被他视为朋友的人出卖，死在孪河城，灰风殉难。布兰和瑞肯也已遇害，被变色龙席恩葛雷乔伊砍了头…但如果梦境没有出错，他们的冰原狼还活着。在王后之冠，一头冰原狼从黑暗中冲出来救了琼恩一命。夏天，肯定是他。他的毛是灰色的，毛毛狗是黑的。他想知道死去的兄弟们会不会有几分精魂存留在他们的狼身上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He filled his basin from the flagon of water beside his bed, washed his face and hands, donned a clean set of black woolens, laced up a black leather jerkin, and pulled on a pair of well-worn boots. Mormont's raven watched with shrewd black eyes, then fluttered to the window. "Do you take me for your thrall?" When Jon folded back the window with its thick diamond-shaped panes of yellow glass, the chill of the morning hit him in the face. He took a breath to clear away the cobwebs of the night as the raven flapped away. That bird is too clever by half. It had been the Old Bear's companion for long years, but that had not stopped it from eating Mormont's face once he died.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="琼恩从床头水壶倒出一盆水洗脸，接着套上一身干净黑毛衣，系好黑皮短外套，脚蹬一双旧皮靴。莫尔蒙的乌鸦用它那双黑亮精明的眼看着，然后扑腾到窗口。“我是你的奴隶吗？”琼恩问乌鸦。菱形窗格里嵌着黄色的厚玻璃；打开窗，清晨寒气扑面。他长出一口浊气，乌鸦飞走了。这个鸟东西有点聪明过头。它跟熊老相伴多年，等到莫尔蒙死后照样吃他脸上的肉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Outside his bedchamber a flight of steps descended to a larger room furnished with a scarred pinewood table and a dozen oak-and-leather chairs. With Stannis in the King's Tower and the Lord Commander's Tower burned to a shell, Jon had established himself in Donal Noye's modest rooms behind the armory. In time, no doubt, he would need larger quarters, but for the moment these would serve whilst he accustomed himself to command.</div>

<div class="line_en">The grant that the king had presented him for signature was on the table beneath a silver drinking cup that had once been Donal Noye's. The one-armed smith had left few personal effects: the cup, six pennies and a copper star, a niello brooch with a broken clasp, a musty brocade doublet that bore the stag of Storm's End. His treasures were his tools, and the swords and knives he made. His life was at the forge. Jon moved the cup aside and read the parchment once again.

He had ridden down the kingsroad almost as far as Queenscrown, prowled through the empty hovels of Mole's Town, inspected the ruined forts at Queensgate and Oakenshield. Each night he walked atop the Wall with Lady Melisandre, and during the days he visited the stockades, picking captives out for the red woman to question. He does not like to be balked.

The Lord Commander's Tower was a shell, the Common Hall a pile of blackened timbers, and Hardin's Tower looked as if the next gust of wind would knock it over… though it had looked that way for years. Behind them rose the Wall: immense, forbidding, frigid, acrawl with builders pushing up a new switchback stair to join the remnants of the old. They worked from dawn to dusk. Without the stair, there was no way to reach the top of the Wall save by winch. That would not serve if the wildlings should attack again.</div>
