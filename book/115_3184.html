<div class="line_en">"What have you been doing this morning?" I can hear her now, propped against her pillows, with all the small irritability of the patient who is not really ill, who has lain in bed too long, and I, reaching to the bedside drawer for the pack of cards, would feel the guilty flush form patches on my neck.</div>

<div class="line_en">I am glad it cannot happen twice, the fever of first love. For it is a fever, and a burden, too, whatever the poets may say. They are not brave, the days when we are twenty-one. They are full of little cowardices, little fears without foundation, and one is so easily bruised, so swiftly wounded, one falls to the first barbed word. Today, wrapped in the complacent armour of approaching middle age, the infinitesimal pricks of day by day brush one lightly and are soon forgotten, but then -- how a careless word would linger, becoming a fiery stigma, and how a look, a glance over a shoulder, branded themselves as things eternal. A denial heralded the thrice crowing of a cock, and an insincerity was like the kiss of Judas. The adult mind can lie with untroubled conscience and a gay composure, but in those days even a small deception scoured the tongue, lashing one against the stake itself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="幸好初恋的狂热不会发生第二次。那确实是种狂热；另外，不管诗人怎么描写，初恋同时又是一种负担。人们在二十一岁上缺乏勇气，因为琐碎小事而怕这怕那，无端担心。在那种年纪，一个人的自尊心很容易受到伤害，动辄生气，听谁说一句略微带刺的话就受不了。今天，我行将跨入中年。中年使人处于满足自得境界的保护之中。中年人也碰到日常的微不足道的烦恼，但他们几乎不感到什么刺痛，而且很快就会把烦恼置之脑后。但那时候情形就大不一样：别人无意之中说的一句话会久久忘不了，成为灼人的耻辱；一个眼色，回眸的一瞥，都可能打上永恒的标记；讨个没趣，那就意味着三夜失眠到鸡啼；言不由衷则像犹大的一吻①。成年人说说可以做到脸不改色心不慌，而在那种年纪，即使在区区小事上说句假话，舌头也会痛上老半天，使你受着炮烙般的苦刑——【注：①犹大：耶稣门徒，出卖耶稣者。据此，犹大的一吻常被后人用来比喻口出利剑。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes," I said, stung by her question, thinking how just and appropriate her word. It described me well. I was underhand. I had not played tennis with the professional at all.

<div class="line_en">I have forgotten much of Monte Carlo, of those morning drives, of where we went, even our conversation; but I have not forgotten how my fingers trembled, cramming on my hat, and how I ran along the corridor and down the stairs, too impatient to wait for the slow whining of the lift, and so outside, brushing the swing doors before the commissionaire could help me.</div>

If he had driven round in circles it would not have mattered to me, for I was in that first flushed stage when to climb into the seat beside him, and lean forward to the wind-screen hugging my knees, was almost too much to bear. I was like a little scrubby schoolboy with a passion for a sixth-form prefect, and he kinder, and far more inaccessible.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="这句话我还记得，因为那时我实在幼稚，穿着他的衣服竟觉得那么甜蜜，仿佛又成了那种替级长抱运动衣的小学生，能够把自己偶像的衣服围在脖子上，得意得要命。借他的上衣，把它技在我的肩头，那怕只有短短几分钟，这本身就是一种胜利，使我的早晨变得光明灿烂！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Not for me the languor and the subtlety I had read about in books. The challenge and the chase. The sword-play, the swift glance, the stimulating smile. The art of provocation was unknown to me, and I would sit with his map upon my lap, the wind blowing my dull, lanky hair, happy in his silence yet eager for his words. Whether he talked or not made little difference to my mood. My only enemy was the clock on the dashboard, whose hands would move relentlessly to one o'clock. We drove east, we drove west, amidst the myriad villages that cling like limpets to the Mediterranean shore, and today I remember none of them.</div>

<div class="line_en">All I remember is the feel of the leather seats, the texture of the map upon my knee, its frayed edges, its worn seams, and how one day, looking at the clock, I thought to myself, "This moment now, at twenty past eleven, this must never be lost," and I shut my eyes to make the experience more lasting. When I opened my eyes we were by a bend in the road, and a peasant girl in a black shawl waved to us; I can see her now, her dusty skirt, her gleaming, friendly smile, and in a second we had passed the bend and could see her no more. Already she belonged to the past, she was only a memory.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我还能记起的仅仅是坐在汽车皮椅上的感觉，膝上地图纵横交错的图案，它的皱边和松散的装订线。我也记得，有一次我曾望着时钟思忖：“此时此刻，十一点二十分，一定要使它成为永久的记忆。”接着我就闭上眼睛，以使当时一刹那的经历更深地印进脑子。等我睁开眼，汽车正在公路上拐弯。一个披黑色围巾的农家姑娘向我们招手。现在我还记得她的模样：蒙着尘土的裙子，脸上带着开朗而友好的微笑。一秒钟之间，我们拐过弯去，再也看不见她了。农家姑娘已成过去，只留下一个记忆。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I wanted to go back again, to recapture the moment that had gone, and then it came to me that if we did it would not be the same, even the sun would be changed in the sky, casting another shadow, and the peasant girl would trudge past us along the road in a different way, not waving this time, perhaps not even seeing us. There was something chilling in the thought, something a little melancholy, and looking at the clock I saw that five more minutes had gone by. Soon we would have reached our time limit, and must return to the hotel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我当时多想返回去，重新捕捉那已逝去的一刻。但我马上又想到，即便真的回去，一切都已不是原样，甚至天空的太阳经过位置的移动也会不同于前一刻；那农家姑娘或许正拖着疲乏的脚步沿公路走去，经过我们面前，这一回不再招手，也许根本没看见我们。这种想法多少使人寒心，感到悲凉。再看看时钟，又过了五分钟。不一会儿，时间就要过尽，我们又得回旅馆去了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I knew then that I would never tell Mrs Van Hopper about these morning expeditions, for her smile would hurt me as his laugh had done. She would not be angry, nor would she be shocked; she would raise her eyebrows very faintly as though she did not altogether believe my story, and then with a tolerant shrug of the shoulder she would say, "My dear child, it's extremely sweet and kind of him to take you driving; the only thing is -- are you sure it does not bore him dreadfully?" And then she would send me out to buy Taxol, patting me on the shoulder.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Is that meant to be a compliment to the day, or to my driving?" he said, and as he laughed, like a mocking brother, I became silent, overwhelmed suddenly by the great gulf between us, and how his very kindness to me widened it.</div>

The silence became minutes, and the minutes became miles, and everything is over now, I thought, I shall never drive with him again. Tomorrow he will go away. And Mrs Van Hopper will be up again. She and I will walk along the terrace as we did before. The porter will bring down his trunks, I shall catch a glimpse of them in the luggage lift, with new-plastered labels. The bustle and finality of departure.

<div class="line_en">"Why, that you lived at Manderley and -- and that you had lost your wife." There, I had said it at last, the word that had hovered on my tongue for days. Your wife. It came out with ease, without reluctance, as though the mere mention of her must be the most casual thing in all the world. Your wife. The word lingered in the air once I had uttered it, dancing before me, and because he received it silently, making no comment, the word magnified itself into something heinous and appalling, a forbidden word, unnatural to the tongue. And I could not call it back, it could never be unsaid. Once again I saw the inscription on the fly-leaf of that book of poems, and the curious slanting R. I felt sick at heart and cold.

<div class="line_en">Then he turned to me and spoke. "A little while ago you talked about an invention," he said, "some scheme for capturing a memory. You would like, you told me, at a chosen moment to live the past again. I'm afraid I think rather differently from you. All memories are bitter, and I prefer to ignore them. Something happened a year ago that altered my whole life, and I want to forget every phase in my existence up to that time. Those days are finished. They are blotted out. I must begin living all over again. The first day we met, your Mrs Van Hopper asked me why I came to Monte Carlo. It put a stopper on those memories you would like to resurrect. It does not always work, of course; sometimes the scent is too strong for the bottle, and too strong for me. And then the devil in one, like a furtive peeping Tom, tries to draw the cork. I did that in the first drive we took together. When we climbed the hills and looked down over the precipice. I was there some years ago, with my wife. You asked me if it was still the same, if it had changed at all. It was just the same, but -- I was thankful to realize oddly impersonal. There was no suggestion of the other time. She and I had left no record. It may have been because you were with me. You have blotted out the past for me, you know, far more effectively than all the bright lights of Monte Carlo. But for you I should have left long ago, gone on to Italy, and Greece, and further still perhaps. You have spared me all those wanderings. Damn your puritanical little tight-lipped speech to me.

<div class="line_en">I was so deep in my picture, I even saw the porter pocketing his tip and going back through the swing-door of the hotel, saying something over his shoulder to the commissionaire, that I did not notice the slowing-down of the car, and it was only when we stopped, drawing up by the side of the road, that I brought myself back to the present once again. He sat motionless, looking without his hat and with his white scarf round his neck, more than ever like someone medieval who lived within a frame. He did not belong to the bright landscape, he should be standing on the steps of a gaunt cathedral, his cloak flung back, while a beggar at his feet scrambled for gold coins.</div>

The mashed stubs of cigarettes lay everywhere -- in cleansing cream, in a dish of grapes, and on the floor beneath the bed. Visitors were lavish with their flowers, and the vases stood cheek-by-jowl in any fashion, hot-house exotics crammed beside mimosa, while a great beribboned casket crowned them all, with tier upon tier of crystallized fruit. Later her friends would come in for a drink, which I must mix for them, hating my task, shy and ill-at-ease in my corner hemmed in by their parrot chatter, and I would be a whipping-boy again, blushing for her when, excited by her little crowd, she must sit up in bed and talk too loudly, laugh too long, reach to the portable gramophone and start a record, shrugging her large shoulders to the tune.

<div class="line_en">I was still child enough to consider a Christian name like a plume in the hat, though from the very first he had called me by mine. The morning, for all its shadowed moments, had promoted me to a new level of friendship, I did not lag so far behind as I had thought. He had kissed me too, a natural business, comforting and quiet. Not dramatic as in books. Not embarrassing. It seemed to bring about an ease in our relationship, it made everything more simple. The gulf between us had been bridged after all. I was to call him Maxim. And that afternoon playing bezique with Mrs Van Hopper was not so tedious as it might have been, though my courage failed me and I said nothing of my morning. For when, gathering her cards together at the end, and reaching for the box, she said casually, "Tell me, is Max de Winter still in the hotel?" I hesitated a moment, like a diver on the brink, then lost my nerve and my tutored self-possession, saying, "Yes, I believe so -- he comes into the restaurant for his meals."</div>

He felt for the brim of my hat, and took hold of it, throwing it over his shoulder to the back seat, and then bent down and kissed the top of my head. "Promise me you will never wear black satin," he said. I smiled then, and he laughed back at me, and the morning was gay again, the morning was a shining thing. Mrs Van Hopper and the afternoon did not matter a flip of the finger. It would pass so quickly, and there would be tonight, and another day tomorrow. I was cocksure, jubilant; at that moment I almost had the courage to claim equality.

It must have been his birthday, and she had put it amongst her other presents on the breakfast table. And they had laughed together as he tore off the paper and string. She leant, perhaps, over his shoulder, while he read. Max. She called him Max. It was familiar, gay, and easy on the tongue. The family could call him Maxim if they liked. Grandmothers and aunts. And people like myself, quiet and dull and youthful, who did not matter. Max was her choice, the word was her possession; she had written it with so great a confidence on the fly-leaf of that book.
