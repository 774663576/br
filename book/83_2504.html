<div class="line_en">There was dim light behind narrow leaded panes in the side door of the Sternwood mansion. I stopped the Packard under the porte-cochere and emptied my pockets out on the seat. The girl snored in the corner, her hat tilted rakishly over her nose, her hands hanging limp in the folds of the raincoat. I got out and rang the bell. Steps came slowly, as if from a long dreary distance. The door opened and the straight, silvery butler looked out at me. The light from the hall made a halo of his hair.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ten blocks of that, winding down curved rain-swept streets, under the steady drip of trees, past lighted windows in big houses in ghostly enormous grounds, vague clusters of eaves and gables and lighted windows high on the hillside, remote and inaccessible, like witch houses in a forest. I came out at a service station glaring with wasted light, where a bored attendant in a white cap and a dark blue windbreaker sat hunched on a stool, inside the steamed glass, reading a paper. I started in, then kept going. I was as wet as I could get already. And on a night like that you can grow a beard waiting for a taxi. And taxi drivers remember.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我沿着风雨凄厉的蜿蜒街道整整走了十个街区，头顶上的枝杈间不停淋下水来，路过庞大阴森的院落，巍然的楼宇窗户亮着，隐约看见一簇簇屋檐和三角墙，山坡的高处也有窗子亮着灯，渺远，可望不可即，仿佛森林里女巫的房子。我来到一个加油站。里头的灯光明亮得毫无必要，雾蒙蒙的玻璃后面有个服务员，他头戴白便帽，身穿深蓝防风茄克，驼着背，坐在凳子上读报纸。我都迈步朝里走了，转念一想，还是继续赶路。我已经浑身湿透。像这样的晚上，等你打到出租车保准胡子都留长了。而且这种时候坐车，司机格外记得住你。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I made it back to Geiger's house in something over half an hour of nimble walking. There was nobody there, no car on the street except my own car in front of the next house. It looked as dismal as a lost dog. I dug my bottle of rye out of it and poured half of what was left down my throat and got inside to light a cigarette. I smoked half of it, threw it away, got out again and went down to Geiger's. I unIocked the door and stepped into the still warm darkness and stood there, dripping quietly on the floor and listening to the rain. I groped to a lamp and lit it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我健步走了半个多小时，回到了盖革家门前。那里没有人，路上也没有车，只有我自己的车停在他邻居家门口。我的车凄凉得犹如丧家之犬。我从车里摸出那瓶酒，把余量的一半倒进喉咙，坐进车里点了根烟。我抽掉半根烟，一扔，又从车里出来，向盖革家走去。我打开房门，踏进静谧温暖的黑暗中，站在那儿，任由身上的水轻轻滴在地板上，听着雨声。我摸到一盏灯，点亮了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The first thing I noticed was that a couple of strips of embroidered silk were gone from the wall. I hadn't counted them, but the spaces of brown plaster stood out naked and obvious. I went a little farther and put another lamp on. I looked at the totem pole. At its foot, beyond the margin of the Chinese rug, on the bare floor another rug had been spread. It hadn't been there before. Geiger's body had. Geiger's body was gone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我留意到的第一点是墙上少了两三条绣花丝绸。总数我没点过，但有几处棕色的灰泥墙面裸露了出来，很是显眼。我往前走了几步，打开另一盏灯。我看了看图腾柱。柱脚下，那条中式地毯的边缘旁本是光秃秃的地板，现在铺上了另一块毯子。那儿原本没放毯子。放的是盖革的尸体。现在，盖革的尸体不见了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That froze me. I pulled my lips back against my teeth and leered at the glass eye in the totem pole. I went through the house again. Everything was exactly as it had been. Geiger wasn't in his flounced bed or under it or in his closet. He wasn't in the kitchen or the bathroom. That left the locked door on the right of the hall. One of Geiger's keys fitted the lock. The room inside was interesting, but Geiger wasn't in it. It was interesting because it was so different from Geiger's room. It was a hard bare masculine bedroom with a polished wood floor, a couple of small throw rugs in an Indian design, two straight chairs, a bureau in dark grained wood with a man's toilet set and two black candles in foot-high brass candlesticks. The bed was narrow and looked hard and had a maroon batik cover. The room felt cold. I locked it up again, wiped the knob off with my handkerchief, and went back to the totem pole. I knelt down and squinted along the nap of the rug to the front door. I thought I could see two parallel grooves pointing that way, as though heels had dragged. Whoever had done it had meant business. Dead men are heavier than broken hearts.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我惊呆了。我抿紧嘴唇，斜眼看图腾柱上的玻璃眼。我又在屋里四处走了一圈。一丝一毫都没有变化。盖革不在铺着荷叶边床罩的床上，也不在床底下，更不在衣柜里。他既不在厨房也不在浴室里。走廊右边那扇门还是锁着。盖革的那串钥匙里有把匹配的。进屋一看很有意思，跟盖革那间全然不同。是间粗犷质朴、阳刚十足的卧室：光洁的木地板，两块印第安风格的小地毯，两把直背椅，带花纹的深色木头梳妆台，台面上是一套男式洗漱用品和两根插在一英尺高烛台上的黑色蜡烛。床很窄，看上去硬邦邦的，盖着褐紫红色的蜡仿印花布床罩。屋里寒气逼人。我重新锁好门，用手帕擦去门把上的指纹，回到图腾柱前。我跪在地上，眯起眼端详从脚下到门口的地毯绒毛。我想我看到了两条平行辙子，像是脚后跟拖出来的。干这事儿的人是动了真格的。死人的分量可比破碎的心更沉重。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It wasn't the law. They would have been there still, just about getting warmed up with their pieces of string and chalk and their cameras and dusting powders and their nickel cigars. They would have been very much there. It wasn't the killer. He had left too fast. He must have seen the girl. He couldn't be sure she was too batty to see him. He would be on his way to distant places. I couldn't guess the answer, but it was all right with me if somebody wanted Geiger missing instead of just murdered. It gave me a chance to find out if I could tell it leaving Carmen Sternwood out. I locked up again, choked my car to life and rode off home to a shower, dry clothes and a late dinner. After that I sat around in the apartment and drank too much hot toddy trying to crack the code in Geiger's blue indexed notebook. All I could be sure of was that it was a list of names and addresses, probably of the customers. There were over four hundred of them. That made it a nice racket, not to mention any blackmail angles, and there were probably plenty of those. Any name on the list might be a prospect as the killer. I didn't envy the police their job when it was handed to them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不是警察干的。是警察的话，他们保管还在屋里，摆弄着绳子、粉笔，准备好相机、扑粉，抽抽劣质雪茄，这时刚做好热身运动呢。准已经忙得热火朝天了。也不是凶手干的。他离开得太匆忙。他肯定看到那女孩了。至于那傻子能否看到他，他没法确定。估计他正在逃往远方。答案我猜不到，但要是有人希望盖革失踪而不是仅仅遭到谋杀，我倒不介意。这让我有机会确认是否真的可以排除卡门·斯特恩伍德的嫌疑。我锁好大门，上车点火，开着尾气滚滚的车回家洗了把澡，换了身干燥衣服，吃了顿迟来的晚饭。之后我坐在房间里，喝了很多香甜热酒[1]，绞尽脑汁想限免盖革那本带索引的蓝色笔记本里的密码。唯一能确定的是，那是一串人名和地址，也许是顾客的。有四百多个。敲诈勒索的事儿肯定很多，暂且不论吧，这买卖做得也挺大。名单上的任何人都有可能是凶手。等这本册子交到警察手里，可有得他们辛苦了。【注：[1]hot toddy：白兰地或威士忌等加糖和香料用热水冲泡后的饮料。】">查看中文翻译</div>
