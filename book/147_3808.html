<div class="line_en">Gant and Eliza came to his graduation. He found them lodgings in the town: it was early June -- hot, green, fiercely and voluptuously Southern. The campus was a green oven; the old grads went about in greasy pairs; the cool pretty girls, who never sweated, came in to see their young men graduate, and to dance; the mamas and papas were shown about dumbly and shyly.</div>

<div class="line_en">On this rich stage, Gant, who had left his charnel-house of death for three days, saw his son Eugene. He came, gathered to life again, out of his grave. He saw his son enthroned in all the florid sentiment of commencement, and the whole of his heart was lifted out of the dust. Upon the lordly sward, shaded by great trees, and ringed by his solemn classmen and their families, Eugene read the Class Poem ("O Mother Of Our Myriad Hopes"). Then Vergil Weldon spoke, high-husky, deep, and solemn-sad; and Living Truth welled in their hearts. It was a Great Utterance. Be true! Be clean! Be good! Be men! Absorb the Negation! The world has need of. Life was never so worth. Never in history had there been. No other class had shown so great a promise as. Among other achievements, the editor of the paper had lifted the moral and intellectual level of the State two inches. The university spirit! Character! Service! Leadership!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="甘特离开了那间死气沉沉的“停尸房”，来到了这个丰富多采的舞台看望他的儿子尤金。他在这里摆脱了悲哀，重新焕发出生命的光彩。他看见儿子在毕业典礼上情绪饱满，表现得非常出色，不禁心花怒放，所有的忧愁一扫而光。在参天大树环绕、散发着高贵气息的草坪上，神情庄重的学生和家长围成一圈，尤金站在他们中间开始朗诵毕业颂诗《啊，母校！万千希望之母》。接着，弗吉尔·韦尔登教授发表感言，他的嗓音高亢、嘶哑、深沉、庄严、忧郁，同学们听后，不由得从心底激发出“生命的真理”。他说的可是“至理名言”啊，一定要求真！要洁身自好！要出人头地！要堂堂正正地做人！要从否定中提高自我！社会需要人们这样做。生活从来没有这么美好过，史无前例的绝佳机遇。没有别的班级堪与之相比。最值得称道的是，校刊主编使本州的道德、知识水平有了大大的提高。发扬大学精神！修身养性！服务大众！发挥带头作用！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The college was charming, half-deserted. Most of the students, except the graduating class, had departed. The air was charged with the fresh sensual heat, the deep green shimmer of heavy leafage, a thousand spermy earth and flower-scents. The young men were touched with sadness, with groping excitement, with glory.</div>

<div class="line_en">Eliza and Gant listened attentively to all the songs and speeches. Their son was a great man on the campus. They saw and heard him before his class, on the campus, and at graduation, when his prizes and honors were announced.

They believed for a moment that all things were possible.</div>

<div class="line_en">They looked shyly at his strange dark face, with all its passionate and naïve ardor, and they felt tenderness and love for his youth and all that was unknown to it. And a great love and pity welled up in him because of their strange and awkward loneliness, and because he felt, through some terrible intuition, that he was already indifferent to the titles and honors they desired for him, and because those which he had come to desire for himself were already beyond the scale of their value. And, before the vision of pity and loss and loneliness, he turned away, clutching his lean hand into his throat.</div>

<div class="line_en">Eugene took them to Exeter and got them comfortably disposed in a Pullman. He was remaining for a few days to gather his belongings -- the clutter of four years, letters, books, old manuscript, worthless rubbish of every description, for he seemed to inherit Eliza's mania for blind accumulation. Extravagant with money, and unable to husband it, he saved everything else even when his spirit grew sick at the stale and dusty weariness of the past.</div>

<div class="line_en">Without asking sharply why, they felt the absurdity of clothing this bounding figure, with the wild dark face, in a frock-coat and string tie: he did not exist in business, trade, or law. More vaguely, they classified him as bookish and a dreamer -- Eliza referred to him as "a good scholar," which, in fact, he had never been. He had simply performed brilliantly in all things that touched his hunger, and dully, carelessly, and indifferently in all things that did not. No one saw very clearly what he was going to do -- he, surely, least of all -- but his family, following the tack of his comrades, spoke vaguely and glibly of "a career in journalism." This meant newspaper work. And, however unsatisfactory this may have been, their inevitable question was drugged for the moment by the glitter of success that had surrounded his life at the university.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们也没有追问他为什么会变成这样，他们只是觉得这个面色阴沉、举止粗鲁的儿子，如果穿上双排扣的正式礼服、系上领结，他高大的身材就会变得又滑稽又可笑，他并不适合在商业、贸易或者法律界发展。他们模模糊糊地把他划归到书呆子、幻想家那一类人里了——伊丽莎在别人面前提起他的时候，常会把他称作“一个不错的学者”。事实上，他从来都不是什么学者。他只不过在自己喜欢的方面做得优秀罢了，而对自己不喜欢的东西，他往往显得迟钝而冷漠。谁也不知道他以后要做什么——他本人也不知道——但是他的家人，只好顺着他那帮同学的说法，模糊、随意地认为他将来会从事新闻事业。这就意味着他会在报社工作。虽然这种工作并不尽如人意，但由于他们当时还沉醉于大学所取得的成绩中，对这些并没有做太多的考虑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He had nothing to tell them. He was nineteen; he had completed his college course; but he did not know what he was going to do. His father's plan that he should study law and "enter politics" had been forgotten since his sophomore year, when it became apparent that the impulse of his life was not toward law. His family felt obscurely that he was an eccentric --"queer," they called it -- and of an impractical or "literary" turn.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其实他并没有什么想法可说。他今年19岁，已经读完了大学，但他的确不知道以后要做什么。父亲希望他学习法律然后“进入政界”，可在大二的时候。他已经把这个计划抛在脑后了，因为他觉得自己的性情明显不适合从事法律工作。家里人隐约觉得他有些怪异——他们把这种情况称为“古怪”——说他思想不切实际，或者说有点“文绉绉”的感觉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He went back to Pulpit Hill for two or three days of delightful loneliness in the deserted college. He prowled through the empty campus at midnight under the great moons of the late rich Spring; he breathed the thousand rich odors of tree and grass and flower, of the opulent and seductive South; and he felt a delicious sadness when he thought of his departure, and saw there in the moon the thousand phantom shapes of the boys he had known who would come no more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他又重新回到讲坛山空荡荡的校园，享受了两三个孤独的日子。他在午夜时分趁着暮春的月色，呼吸着南方大地上花草树木散发出的多种肥沃、诱人的气息。他一想起自己即将离开这里，胸中便会涌起一股淡淡的忧伤。在月光下，他看见无数同学熟悉的幻影，现在他们都将一去不返了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But Eugene was untroubled by thought of a goal. He was mad with such ecstasy as he had never known. He was a centaur, moon-eyed and wild of mane, torn apart with hunger for the golden world. He became at times almost incapable of coherent speech. While talking with people, he would whinny suddenly into their startled faces, and leap away, his face contorted with an idiot joy. He would hurl himself squealing through the streets and along the paths, touched with the ecstasy of a thousand unspoken desires. The world lay before him for his picking -- full of opulent cities, golden vintages, glorious triumphs, lovely women, full of a thousand unmet and magnificent possibilities. Nothing was dull or tarnished. The strange enchanted coasts were unvisited. He was young and he could never die.</div>

<div class="line_en">And in the day he went to talk with Vergil Weldon. The old man was charming, confidential, full of wise intimacy, gentle humor. They sat beneath the great trees of his yard and drank iced tea. Eugene was thinking of California, Peru, Asia, Alaska, Europe, Africa, China. But he mentioned Harvard. For him, it was not the name of a university -- it was rich magic, wealth, elegance, joy, proud loneliness, rich books and golden browsing; it was an enchanted name like Cairo and Damascus.

Do you think you have replaced my childhood's God with your Absolute? No, you have only replaced his beard with a mustache, and a glint of demon hawk-eyes. To me, you were above good, above truth, above righteousness. To me, you were the sufficient negation to all your teachings. Whatever you did was, by its doing, right.

With a desperate pain, he faced departure from that Arcadian wilderness where he had known so much joy. At night he roamed the deserted campus, talking quietly until morning with a handful of students who lingered strangely, as he did, among the ghostly buildings, among the phantoms of lost boys.

As the car that was taking him to Exeter roared down the winding street, under the hot green leafiness of June, he heard, as from the sea-depth of a dream, far-faint, the mellow booming of the campus bell. And suddenly it seemed to him that all the beaten walks were thudding with the footfalls of lost boys, himself among them, running for their class.

<div class="line_en">Gant was fed and cared for by Helen. She moved back and forth in ceaseless fret between Eliza's house and Hugh Barton's, in constant rhythms of wild energy and depletion, anger, hysteria, weariness and indifference. She had had no children and, it seemed, would have none. For this reason, she had long periods of brooding morbidity, during which she drugged herself with nibbling potations of patent tonics, medicines with a high alcoholic content, home-made wines, and corn whiskey. Her large eyes grew lustreless and dull, her big mouth had a strain of hysteria about it, she would pluck at her long chin and burst suddenly into tears. She talked restlessly, fretfully, incessantly, wasting and losing herself in a net of snarled nerves, in endless gossip, incoherent garrulity about the townsfolk, the neighbors, disease, doctors, hospitals, death.</div>

<div class="line_en">He thought of her only as a very chill and respectable woman. He played Casino -- the only game he knew -- with her and the other boarders, and called her "ma'am." Then one night she took his hand, saying she would show him how to make love to a girl. She tickled the palm, put it around her waist, lifted it to her breast, and plumped over on his shoulder, breathing stertorously through her pinched nostrils and saying, "God, boy!" over and over. He plunged around the dark cool streets until three in the morning, wondering what he would do about it. Then he came back to the sleeping house, and crept on shoeless feet into her room. Fear and disgust were immediate. He climbed the hills to ease his tortured spirit and stayed away from the house for hours. But she would follow him down the halls or open her door suddenly on him, clad in a red kimono. She became very ugly and bitter, and accused him of betraying, dishonoring, and deserting her. She said that where she came from -- the good old State of South Carolina -- a man who treated a woman in such fashion would get a bullet in him. Eugene thought of new lands. He was in an agony of repentance and guilty abasement: he framed a long plea for pardon and included it in his prayers at night, for he still prayed, not from devout belief, but from the superstition of habit and number, muttering a set formula over sixteen times, while he held his breath. Since childhood he had believed in the magical efficacy of certain numbers -- on Sunday he would do only the second thing that came into his head and not the first -- and this intricate ritual of number and prayer he was a slave to, not to propitiate God, but to fulfil a mysterious harmonic relation with the universe, or to pay worship to the demonic force that brooded over him. He could not sleep of nights until he did this.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“也罢，到时候等你一路远行到了那里——人们所说的——北方地区——你可要去看看你舅舅爱默生和波士顿的所有亲戚。那一年他们到我们这里来的时候，你露西舅妈特别喜欢你——他们经常说，要是我们家有谁去他们那里，他们一定会非常高兴的——有时候一个人到了陌生的地方，人生地不熟的，要是能有个熟人就再好不过了。另外——等你见到爱默生舅舅以后，你不妨告诉他，要是哪一天他见到我去看望他时，千万别觉得有些意外。”（她神情十足地点着头）——“我希望等我一切准备停当后，也要像别人那样放开手脚到外地去轻松一下——我只需要收拾好行李就可以走了——不用给任何人提起这事——我可不想一辈子都待在厨房里累死累活的，就像个奴隶——那可太不划算了——今年秋天我再做成几笔生意后，我一定会像我一直希望的那样到外面去开阔一下眼界——前几天我还跟卡什·兰金先生谈过这个事呢——‘哎呀，甘特太太，’他说，‘要是我有您那样灵光的脑袋，五年内就变成富翁了——你可是这个小城里最出色的商人了。’他就是这样夸我的。‘你不要再跟我谈什么生意了，’我说，‘等我把手头的这几块地皮解决掉以后，我就洗手不干了，不再过问与地产有关的事了——我们到头来什么也带不走啊，兰金先生，’我说，‘寿衣上可没有口袋，到头来，我们只需六英尺见方、能够安身的地方就足够了——所以我打算洗手不干了，准备享一享清福了——人们常说——切勿后悔莫及。’‘哎呀，难得你会有这样的想法，甘特夫人。’他说，‘我看你说的这些话一点儿没错——我们去的时候什么也带不走的。’他还说：‘再说，就算能带走，拿到阴间又有什么用处啊？’不过我告诉你（她突然改变了语气，用往常习惯的那种男性姿势挥了一下手），我这儿有一件事需要做——你应该记得我曾经说过的夕阳街的那块地——”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Why, yes," she said, nodding briskly. "I'd show them! I'd act as if I thought I was Somebody. Son," she said more gravely, with a sudden change from her tremulous banter, "it worries me to see you walk like that. You'll get lung-trouble as sure as you're born if you go all humped over. That's one thing about your papa; he always carried himself as straight as a rod. Of course, he's not as straight now as he used to be-as the fellow says" (she smiled tremulously)—"I reckon we all have a tendency to shrink up a little as we get older. But in his young days there wasn't a straighter man in town."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不错，就那样，”她边说边轻快地点着头，“我要让他们瞧一瞧！如果我有自信成为大人物，我就会表现出来。孩子。”渐渐地，她的语气开始变得严肃起来：“一看见你走路的样子我就有些担心，你如果老是那样弯腰驼背的，到头来很容易患上肺病的。你爸爸有一个优点：他的身体经常挺得直直的。当然啦，他现在已经大不如从前了——就像人们常说的，”（她身体微颤地笑了起来）——“恐怕等我们变老的时候，每个人都要缩回去一点的。但是你爸爸年轻的时候，这个小城里再也没有人比他的身体更直了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And then the terrible silence came between them again. He had turned sullenly upon her while she talked. Indecisively she stopped, peered down at him with white pursed face, and in that silence, behind the trivial arras of her talk, he heard the bitter song of all her life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着又是一阵可怕的沉默。她说话的时候，尤金停下了脚步，脸色阴沉地转过身望着她。她犹豫地停下了话头，面色苍白，眉头紧皱，正静静地凝视着他。在这种沉默里，在她琐碎的话语背后，他听出了她一生的悲歌。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Good-bye," he muttered harshly. "Good-bye! Good-bye, mama!" A wild strange cry, like that of a beast in pain, was torn from his throat. His eyes were blind with tears; he tried to speak, to get into a word, a phrase, all the pain, the beauty, and the wonder of their lives -- every step of that terrible voyage which his incredible memory and intuition took back to the dwelling of her womb. But no word came, no word could come; he kept crying hoarsely again and again, "Good-bye, good-bye."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“再见！”他哽咽着说，心情特别难受。“再见！再见了，妈妈！”他像一只痛苦的野兽，从喉咙里发出一声狂野、怪异的叫声。他的眼睛已被泪水模糊得看不清了。他竭力想说出一个词、一个短语，说出他们生命的所有痛苦、美好和神奇——凭他超常的记忆和直觉，用只言片语把可怕的人生之旅全部表达出来，一直回溯到娘胎里为止。但是他一个字也找不出来，一个字也说不出口，他一次又一次嘶哑地大声说着：“再见，再见。”">查看中文翻译</div>
