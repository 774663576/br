<div class="line_en">About the refinements, or, as he called them, the "ghosts" of wit, the king troubled himself very little. He had an especial admiration for breadth in a jest, and would often put up with length, for the sake of it. Over-niceties wearied him. He would have preferred Rabelais's "Gargantua," to the "Zadig" of Voltaire: and, upon the whole, practical jokes suited his taste far better than verbal ones.</div>

<div class="line_en">I never knew any one so keenly alive to a joke as the king was. He seemed to live only for joking. To tell a good story of the joke kind, and to tell it well, was the surest road to his favor. Thus it happened that his seven ministers were all noted for their accomplishments as jokers. They all took after the king, too, in being large, corpulent, oily men, as well as inimitable jokers. Whether people grow fat by joking, or whether there is something in fat itself which predisposes to a joke, I have never been quite able to determine; but certain it is that a lean joker is a rara avis in terris.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我真不知道有谁跟皇帝一样好听笑话。看模样皇帝生来就是为了开开玩笑。谁要讲个笑话奇谈，讲得娓娓动听，包管得宠。说来也巧，御前七员大臣倒全是出名的说笑专家；而且个个都跟皇帝一样，不但是无与伦比的小丑，还是身材魁梧、脑满肠肥的样子。人究竟是开了玩笑才长胖的，还是胖大个儿骨子里就好开玩笑，要我说出个准谱，压根没这分能耐；但不消说，一个小丑长得皮包骨头，倒是稀世宝。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At the date of my narrative, professing jesters had not altogether gone out of fashion at court. Several of the great continental "powers" still retained their "fools," who wore motley, with caps and bells, and who were expected to be always ready with sharp witticisms, at a moment's notice, in consideration of the crumbs that fell from the royal table.</div>

<div class="line_en">I believe the name "Hop-Frog" was not that given to the dwarf by his sponsors at baptism, but it was conferred upon him, by general consent of the several ministers, on account of his inability to walk as other men do. In fact, Hop-Frog could only get along by a sort of interjectional gait -- something between a leap and a wriggle -- a movement that afforded illimitable amusement, and of course consolation, to the king, for (notwithstanding the protuberance of his stomach and a constitutional swelling of the head) the king, by his whole court, was accounted a capital figure.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="照我看，“跳蛙”这名字决不是矮子受洗时，教父教母给他取的，八成是七位大臣看他走路不同常人，才商定赐了他这个外号。其实跳蛙走起路来，只会象画花——一半象跳，一半象扭——这么走法看得万岁爷乐不可支，当然也引以自慰，因为万岁爷尽管长得肚子象牯牛，头大如笆斗，满朝文武还是把万岁爷当做数一数二的美男子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His fool, or professional jester, was not only a fool, however. His value was trebled in the eyes of the king, by the fact of his being also a dwarf and a cripple. Dwarfs were as common at court, in those days, as fools; and many monarchs would have found it difficult to get through their days (days are rather longer at court than elsewhere) without both a jester to laugh with, and a dwarf to laugh at. But, as I have already observed, your jesters, in ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, are fat, round and unwieldy -- so that it was no small source of self-gratulation with our king that, in Hop-Frog (this was the fool's name,) he possessed a triplicate treasure in one person.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="话说回来，万岁爷的弄臣，那个专业小丑，不仅仅是个傻子，其实还是个矮子，又是个瘸子，在皇上眼里身价就此高了三倍。当年在宫廷中，矮子正眼傻子一样平常；不少帝王要没个小丑陪着笑闹一场，要没个矮子拿来取笑一通，就觉得日子难过，在宫廷里，时光可比其他地方长得多呢。前文中早有交代，凡是小丑十之八九长得肥头大耳，笨手笨脚，所以万岁爷眼看跳蛙（这就是弄臣的名字）一个顶三个活宝，就别提有多得意了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Our king, as a matter of course, retained his "fool." The fact is, he required something in the way of folly -- if only to counterbalance the heavy wisdom of the seven wise men who were his ministers -- not to mention himself.</div>

<div class="line_en">I am not able to say, with precision, from what country Hop-Frog originally came. It was from some barbarous region, however, that no person ever heard of -- a vast distance from the court of our king. Hop-Frog, and a young girl very little less dwarfish than himself (although of exquisite proportions, and a marvellous dancer,) had been forcibly carried off from their respective homes in adjoining provinces, and sent as presents to the king, by one of his ever-victorious generals.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="跳蛙原籍哪里，可说不准。他出身在一个闻所未闻的蛮荒地区，离开皇宫老远老远呢。还有一个年轻姑娘，跟他差不多矮小，长得倒骨肉停匀，还是个出色的舞蹈家。两人的家乡近在毗邻，当初御前有位常胜将军，把他们分别掳来，进贡了皇上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Under these circumstances, it is not to be wondered at that a close intimacy arose between the two little captives. Indeed, they soon became sworn friends. Hop-Frog, who, although he made a great deal of sport, was by no means popular, had it not in his power to render Trippetta many services; but she, on account of her grace and exquisite beauty (although a dwarf,) was universally admired and petted: so she possessed much influence; and never failed to use it, whenever she could, for the benefit of Hop-Frog.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这两个小俘虏既是同病相怜，无怪乎亲热起来；自然不久就结成兄妹。跳蛙尽管大耍把戏，要不能替屈丽佩泰效劳，根本就不受人欢迎；她尽管矮小，却是举止端庄，姿色地众，人人对她倾倒，个个把她宠爱；因此炙手可热；无论什么时候，只要办得到，她就替跳蛙出头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But although Hop-Frog, through the distortion of his legs, could move only with great pain and difficulty along a road or floor, the prodigious muscular power which nature seemed to have bestowed upon his arms, by way of compensation for deficiency in the lower limbs, enabled him to perform many feats of wonderful dexterity, where trees or ropes were in question, or anything else to climb. At such exercises he certainly much more resembled a squirrel, or a small monkey, than a frog.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="话可说回来，跳蛙两腿固然长得畸形，走起路来总不免费心费力，看模样造物主为了弥补他下肢的缺陷，特地赐给他双臂无穷臂力，无论树木绳索一类可以攀爬的东西，他都能在上面表演不少身手矫捷的绝技。干着这套玩艺，当然跟松鼠猴崽不相上下，哪里还象青蛙。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On some grand state occasion -- I forget what -- the king determined to have a masquerade, and whenever a masquerade or anything of that kind, occurred at our court, then the talents both of Hop-Frog and Trippetta were sure to be called in play. Hop-Frog, in especial, was so inventive in the way of getting up pageants, suggesting novel characters, and arranging costume, for masked balls, that nothing could be done, it seems, without his assistance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一次，碰到个盛大国庆——什么节日可不记得了——万岁爷决定举行一次化装舞会。每逢宫廷中举行化装舞会之类的盛会，跳娃和屈丽佩泰两人准要奉旨前去一显身手；跳蛙心思尤其巧妙，善于准备舞会节目，编排新奇脚色，张罗服装，因此没他帮忙，仿佛什么也办不成。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The night appointed for the fête had arrived. A gorgeous hall had been fitted up, under Trippetta's eye, with every kind of device which could possibly give éclât to a masquerade. The whole court was in a fever of expectation. As for costumes and characters, it might well be supposed that everybody had come to a decision on such points. Many had made up their minds (as to what rôles they should assume) a week, or even a month, in advance; and, in fact, there was not a particle of indecision anywhere -- except in the case of the king and his seven minsters. Why they hesitated I never could tell, unless they did it by way of a joke. More probably, they found it difficult, on account of being so fat, to make up their minds. At all events, time flew; and, as a last resource, they sent for Trippetta and Hop-Frog.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到了钦定节日那一夜。在屈丽佩泰的监督下，一座金碧辉煌的大殿早已摆上五花八门的装饰，足以使化装舞会大放异彩。满朝文武全等得不耐烦了。说到穿什么衣服，扮什么脚色，不难想象，主意都早已拿定。好多人在一个礼拜前，甚至个把月前，就决定扮什么脚色了；事实上，除了万岁爷和七位大臣，到处都不见有人心猿意马。万岁爷他们要不是心开玩笑，我压根就说不上为什么这样。八成是长得太胖，才不易拿定主意吧。总的一句话，时间一眨眼就过去了；他们想尽办法，最后只得下旨传见屈丽佩泰和跳蛙。">查看中文翻译</div>

It happened to be the poor dwarf's birthday, and the command to drink to his "absent friends" forced the tears to his eyes. Many large, bitter drops fell into the goblet as he took it, humbly, from the hand of the tyrant.</div>

<div class="line_en">When the two little friends obeyed the summons of the king, they found him sitting at his wine with the seven members of his cabinet council; but the monarch appeared to be in a very ill humor.

<div class="line_en">"I will equip you as ourang-outangs," proceeded the dwarf; "leave all that to me. The resemblance shall be so striking, that the company of masqueraders will take you for real beasts -- and of course, they will be as much terrified as astonished."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“奴才来给陛下和大人扮成猩猩吧，”矮子往下说道，“一切都交给奴才来办吧。外表模样得扮得维妙维肖，这样参加舞会的才会把陛下和大人当作真野兽——说真个的，他们一看不但惊奇，也管保害怕。””">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The chains are for the purpose of increasing the confusion by their jangling. You are supposed to have escaped, en masse, from your keepers. Your majesty cannot conceive the effect produced, at a masquerade, by eight chained ourang-outangs, imagined to be real ones by most of the company; and rushing in with savage cries, among the crowd of delicately and gorgeously habited men and women. The contrast is inimitable."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“戴上铁链，为的是让大家听到铁链咣榔榔响，就更乱了。陛下和大人算是一齐从看守手里逃了出来。陛下可想不出这效果有多好，化装舞会上来了八个带铁链的猩猩，在场的多半还道是真猩猩呢；粗声野气的叫喊着，冲过去，插在一群穿绸着缓，锦衣绣服的男女当中。天下没比这更妙的对照啦。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It must be," said the king: and the council arose hurriedly (as it was growing late), to put in execution the scheme of Hop-Frog.</div>

<div class="line_en">His mode of equipping the party as ourang-outangs was very simple, but effective enough for his purposes. The animals in question had, at the epoch of my story, very rarely been seen in any part of the civilized world; and as the imitations made by the dwarf were sufficiently beast-like and more than sufficiently hideous, their truthfulness to nature was thus thought to be secured.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="跳蛙将君臣八人扮成猩猩的法子虽很简单，但很灵，原来目的不愁达不到。在这段故事的年月里，文明世界中难得看到猩猩；矮子装扮出来的假猩猩简直可以乱真，把人吓死，管保当做真猩猩。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The king and his ministers were first encased in tight-fitting stockinet shirts and drawers. They were then saturated with tar. At this stage of the process, some one of the party suggested feathers; but the suggestion was at once overruled by the dwarf, who soon convinced the eight, by ocular demonstration, that the hair of such a brute as the ourang-outang was much more efficiently represented by flax. A thick coating of the latter was accordingly plastered upon the coating of tar. A long chain was now procured. First, it was passed about the waist of the king, and tied; then about another of the party, and also tied; then about all successively, in the same manner. When this chaining arrangement was complete, and the party stood as far apart from each other as possible, they formed a circle; and to make all things appear natural, Hop-Frog passed the residue of the chain, in two diameters, at right angles, across the circle, after the fashion adopted, at the present day, by those who capture Chimpanzees, or other large apes, in Borneo.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="万岁爷和七位大臣先给裹上窄小的弹力布衬衣衬裤，再浸透柏油。这时，君臣八人中有人出主意，不妨插上翎毛；谁知矮子顿时驳回，马上振振有理的说得他们相信，类似猩猩这种畜生的兽毛，拿麻代替，不能再象。于是乎柏油上面就粘了厚厚一层麻。接着又取来长长一条铁链；先绕在万岁爷的腰际；绑好；再绕在一位大臣的腰际，绑好；然后在其他大臣的腰际—一绕过，绑好。这样戴上了铁链，各人尽量离得远远的站好，围成一圈。为了逼真起见，跳蛙按照今日婆罗洲人捕捉黑猩猩之类大人猿的办法，将剩下的铁链当作两根直径，交成直角，横贯圆周。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The arrangements of the room had been left to Trippetta's superintendence; but, in some particulars, it seems, she had been guided by the calmer judgment of her friend the dwarf. At his suggestion it was that, on this occasion, the chandelier was removed. Its waxen drippings (which, in weather so warm, it was quite impossible to prevent,) would have been seriously detrimental to the rich dresses of the guests, who, on account of the crowded state of the saloon, could not all be expected to keep from out its centre -- that is to say, from under the chandelier. Additional sconces were set in various parts of the hall, out of the way; and a flambeau, emitting sweet odor, was placed in the right hand of each of the Caryaides (Caryatides) that stood against the wall -- some fifty or sixty altogether.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="殿内一切布置本来交给屈丽佩泰监督照料；但有些细节看来是按着伙伴矮子的卓见办理。这回，照他意思，烛灯撤掉了。天这么热，难免没有烛泪掉下，大殿内挤得水泄不通，来宾中势必有人挤在大殿当中，换句话说，就是烛灯底下，烛泪免不了弄脏华丽衣服。殿内各个角落，凡是不碍手脚的地方，都另外摆上烛台；靠墙有排女像石柱，总共五六十个，右手各执火把一支，散发出馥郁香味。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The grand saloon in which the masquerade was to take place, was a circular room, very lofty, and receiving the light of the sun only through a single window at top. At night (the season for which the apartment was especially designed,) it was illuminated principally by a large chandelier, depending by a chain from the centre of the sky-light, and lowered, or elevated, by means of a counter-balance as usual; but (in order not to look unsightly) this latter passed outside the cupola and over the roof.</div>

<div class="line_en">The excitement among the masqueraders was prodigious, and filled the heart of the king with glee. As had been anticipated, there were not a few of the guests who supposed the ferocious-looking creatures to be beasts of some kind in reality, if not precisely ourang-outangs. Many of the women swooned with affright; and had not the king taken the precaution to exclude all weapons from the saloon, his party might soon have expiated their frolic in their blood. As it was, a general rush was made for the doors; but the king had ordered them to be locked immediately upon his entrance; and, at the dwarf's suggestion, the keys had been deposited with him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="来宾间这分乱，可别提多大了，看得万岁爷暗暗高兴。果不其然，多半人要不把这些青面涂牙的畜生当作猩猩，至少当作什么真的野兽。好多女宾吓得当场晕死；要不是万岁爷早加提防，拿掉殿内一切刀枪兵器，他这一伙恐怕早用鲜血来偿付这番胡闹啦。事实上，大家已经一齐向门口涌去；不过万岁爷一进大殿，就下旨将四门锁上了；而且按着矮子的意思，门上钥匙全藏在万岁爷的身边。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The eight ourang-outangs, taking Hop-Frog's advice, waited patiently until midnight (when the room was thoroughly filled with masqueraders) before making their appearance. No sooner had the clock ceased striking, however, than they rushed, or rather rolled in, all together -- for the impediment of their chains caused most of the party to fall, and all to stumble as they entered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="八个猩猩听从跳蛙的话，耐性守到半夜，殿内挤满了来宾，方始露脸。钟声刚停，他们一齐冲过去，其实还不如说是滚了进去，因为铁链碍手碍脚，害得多半都栽倒了，个个都是磕磕绊绊的跌进殿里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Soon after this, the king and his seven friends, having reeled about the hall in all directions, found themselves, at length, in its centre, and, of course, in immediate contact with the chain. While they were thus situated, the dwarf, who had followed closely at their heels, inciting them to keep up the commotion, took hold of their own chain at the intersection of the two portions which crossed the circle diametrically and at right angles. Here, with the rapidity of thought, he inserted the hook from which the chandelier had been wont to depend; and, in an instant, by some unseen agency, the chandelier-chain was drawn so far upward as to take the hook out of reach, and, as an inevitable consequence, to drag the ourang-outangs together in close connection, and face to face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="铁链一放下，万岁爷和七个伙伴在殿内四面八方踉踉跄跄走着，终于闯到大厅当中，不消说，恰恰挨着灯链。矮子原先悄悄跟在他们背后，撺掇他们吵个不休，等他们那样一站，他就捏住绑在他们身上的铁链那贯穿圆周的交叉部分；灵机一动，顿时将灯链钩子钩住铁链；说时迟那时快，没见有谁在拉，灯链竟径自升了上去，高得伸手够不着钩子了，八个猩猩就不免紧紧拉在一起，面面相对。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">While the tumult was at its height, and each masquerader attentive only to his own safety -- (for, in fact, there was much real danger from the pressure of the excited crowd,) -- the chain by which the chandelier ordinarily hung, and which had been drawn up on its removal, might have been seen very gradually to descend, until its hooked extremity came within three feet of the floor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大殿里乱得不可开交，来宾全只顾自己逃命，因为这群受惊的人推推搡搡的，才真叫悬呢。当初撤去烛灯时，灯链给拉了上去，现在又见缓缓放下，链钩离地不到三尺。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The masqueraders, by this time, had recovered, in some measure, from their alarm; and, beginning to regard the whole matter as a well-contrived pleasantry, set up a loud shout of laughter at the predicament of the apes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这早晚，来宾才多少安下心；慢慢把这事看作巧妙编排的滑稽戏，眼见八个猿人不上不下，就放声大笑了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Here, scrambling over the heads of the crowd, he managed to get to the wall; when, seizing a flambeau from one of the Caryaides (Caryatides), he returned, as he went, to the centre of the room -- leaped, with the agility of a monkey, upon the kings head -- and thence clambered a few feet up the chain -- holding down the torch to examine the group of ourang-outangs, and still screaming, "I shall soon find out who they are!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说着他排开人堆，好不容易挤到墙跟前；在一个女像石柱上取了支火把，重新回到大殿当中；纵身一跳，到了万岁势头上，手脚麻利，活象猴子；再顺着灯链爬上几尺；拿着火把往下打量那伙猩猩，嘴里还在叫嚷：“小的马上就看出他们是什么人。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Leave them to me! " now screamed Hop-Frog, his shrill voice making itself easily heard through all the din. "Leave them to me. I fancy I know them. If I can only get a good look at them, I can soon tell who they are."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“把他们交给小的吧！”这时跳蛙叫道，在一片喧哗声中，倒不难听到他那尖嗓子。“把他们交给小的。小的大概认识他们。只消好好看一下，就能马上说出是什么人来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And now, while the whole assembly (the apes included) were convulsed with laughter, the jester suddenly uttered a shrill whistle; when the chain flew violently up for about thirty feet -- dragging with it the dismayed and struggling ourang-outangs, and leaving them suspended in mid-air between the sky-light and the floor. Hop-Frog, clinging to the chain as it rose, still maintained his relative position in respect to the eight maskers, and still (as if nothing were the matter) continued to thrust his torch down towards them, as though endeavoring to discover who they were.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这如今，全殿的人，连猿人也在内，个个笑破肚子，冷不防，小丑嘘的打了个呼哨；灯链猛的升高三十来英尺——八个猩猩狼狈不堪，死命挣扎，一起拖了上去，吊在半空，上不接天，下不着地。跳蛙抱住灯链。随着上升，跟那八个套假面具的照旧保持一定距离，照旧若无其事似的拿火把冲下照在他们脸上，仿佛拚命想看出他们是什么人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So thoroughly astonished were the whole company at this ascent, that a dead silence, of about a minute's duration, ensued. It was broken by just such a low, harsh, grating sound, as had before attracted the attention of the king and his councillors, when the former threw the wine in the face of Trippetta. But, on the present occasion, there could be no question as to whence the sound issued. It came from the fang-like teeth of the dwarf, who ground them and gnashed them as he foamed at the mouth, and glared, with an expression of maniacal rage, into the upturned countenances of the king and his seven companions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大家眼看灯链上升，不由大惊失色，顿时一片死寂。过了分把钟，才响起低低一阵刺耳的嘎嘎声，当初万岁爷将酒泼在屈丽佩泰脸上，跟七位枢密大臣一起听到的就是这一声。不过，目前这一声从哪里发出的，倒是不言而喻。原来是矮子那犬牙般的牙缝间发出来的，他唾沫四溅，咬牙切齿，满脸怒火，气疯了，狠狠瞪着君臣八人仰起的脸庞。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Ah, ha!" said at length the infuriated jester. "Ah, ha! I begin to see who these people are, now!" Here, pretending to scrutinize the king more closely, he held the flambeau to the flaxen coat which enveloped him, and which instantly burst into a sheet of vivid flame. In less than half a minute the whole eight ourang-outangs were blazing fiercely, amid the shrieks of the multitude who gazed at them from below, horror-stricken, and without the power to render them the slightest assistance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，哈！”小丑火冒三丈，终于说道。“啊，哈！小的现在可看出是什么人了！”说着装作更仔细的打量万岁爷，火把凑近万岁爷身上裹着的那层麻，转眼就起了蛇舌般的—片火焰。不消片刻，四下里响起人群一片尖叫，八个猩猩全都烧着了，这群人在下面楞楞望着，吓得战战兢兢，可就是无能为力。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It is supposed that Trippetta, stationed on the roof of the saloon, had been the accomplice of her friend in his fiery revenge, and that, together, they effected their escape to their own country: for neither was seen again.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I now see distinctly," he said, "what manner of people these maskers are. They are a great king and his seven privy-councillors -- a king who does not scruple to strike a defenceless girl, and his seven councillors who abet him in the outrage. As for myself, I am simply Hop-Frog, the jester -- and this is my last jest."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这几个套假面具的是什么种人，小的现在可看清了，”他道。“其中一位是皇帝陛下，其余七位是枢密顾问大臣，——万岁爷毫不容情的打一个手无寸铁的姑娘，七位枢密大臣竟然为虎作怅。在下嘛，在下就是小丑跳蛙——这也是在下演的最后一出滑稽戏啦。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At length the flames, suddenly increasing in virulence, forced the jester to climb higher up the chain, to be out of their reach; and, as he made this movement, the crowd again sank, for a brief instant, into silence. The dwarf seized his opportunity, and once more spoke:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="火势愈来愈旺，一下子到了不可收拾的地步。小丑只得顺着灯链往上爬；下面一伙人刹时又不作声。矮子就又趁机说话；">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Owing to the high combustibility of both the flax and the tar to which it adhered, the dwarf had scarcely made an end of his brief speech before the work of vengeance was complete.

The cripple hurled his torch at them, clambered leisurely to the ceiling, and disappeared through the sky-light.</div>
