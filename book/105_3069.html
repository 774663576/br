<div class="line_en">In truth, they'd come quite far, almost reached the valley without the woman realising what was happening. They might have made it all the way to the line -- a feat Tristan had never achieved in all the thousands of souls he'd had to ferry -- had it not been for the wraiths. This soul, this woman, was so timid, so docile and compliant that she hadn't once questioned Tristan's word. It had become almost annoying, as if she were blank paper, completely vacant. But it had been convenient.</div>

<div class="line_en">It wasn't a question, so Tristan didn't bother to answer it. He just stared straight ahead, letting the flickering light of the flames lull him into a semi-trance. He hated this bit. Hated the crying and the moaning and the pleading.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这不是问句，所以崔斯坦并没有费事回答。他只是直勾勾地望着前方，让摇曳的炉火把自己带入半清醒半恍惚的心境中去。他打心里讨厌眼下这段时光，厌恶她哭哭啼啼、悲叹抱怨、恳求哀告。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The wraiths, though, would never let one so innocent and naive pass through the wasteland without a fight. They had dared to risk the sun, using the flimsy shadows of trees and bushes to attack. They had been easy to evade, but they'd been loud. And there had been nothing he could do to stop her looking towards the noise.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tristan blinked once, dragging himself back to the room, and looked at her. Her shoulders were hunched up, her eyes huge, her arms wrapped around her chest, as if she were trying to hug herself. He looked at her, at her pathetic expression, and he made himself feel absolutely nothing. Still, he was her ferryman; he had to answer.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“如果它们抓住了你，就会吞噬掉你的灵魂，然后你就会成为它们中的一员。”崔斯坦的目光移到别处，不去看她脸上恐惧的表情。他还是不由自主地开始为她感到难过。他再也承担不起这样的感情投入，不能有第二次了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I thought that you were going to rob me at first, you know," she said quietly, her voice steadier than he would have expected. She huffed a humourless laugh. "When I saw you outside my house, I thought you were one of the neighbourhood thugs, come to steal from me. I was going to call the police."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你知道，一开始我还以为你要打劫我呢。”她终于开始安静讲话了，声音比他预想的要沉着很多。她干笑了一声，接着说，“看到你在我家外面站着，我还以为你也是在附近活动的一个恶棍，打算来顺我点什么东西。我都准备要报警了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tristan nodded without looking at her. He'd seen that in her face as she'd peeped through the window at him and he'd been concerned for a brief moment. It was the way he was dressed; his age, face. It was all wrong for this woman. He should be older, someone gentlemanly. The type of man she would trust. He should not be the same boy who had been sent to collect Dylan from the train.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="崔斯坦没有看她，只是点了点头。他当时从她透过窗子打量他的表情中看出了她的心思，为此还担心了一会儿。这全是因为他的穿着打扮、年纪与相貌，对这个女人来说这样的形象完全不合适。他本该变得岁数更大一点，一副中年绅士派头才对，那才是她会信任的那种人。他不该还像从列车里迎接迪伦时那样，依旧是大男孩的模样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Why hadn't he changed? It didn't make sense. He'd never held on to a form before. And then, as they'd been leaving her street, he'd sworn he'd seen someone looking at him. He didn't understand it, but he didn't like it. It made it harder to try to forget about Dylan this way; to leave the pain behind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="为什么自己没有变化呢？这完全说不通。以前他从来留不住上一次执行任务时的相貌。然后，当他们离开那条街道时，他敢肯定有人在看着他。虽然不明白为什么，但他不喜欢这种感觉。这样一来要忘记迪伦、把痛苦抛在脑后就变得更加困难了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The wasteland was no cooler in the early light of dawn. Dylan stood on the threshold of the cottage. She'd been there for a while, fighting with herself. There were wraiths outside already, swooping across the surface of the lake like birds. Again, though, they hadn't come near her. The safe house seemed to be holding. She could stay here. Stay here, be safe, and wait for Tristan. But what if he didn't make it this far? What if the soul he was ferrying was too old, too slow? Besides, she was aching for him. The idea of waiting, for however long, was excruciating. She had to go and find him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="晨曦中的荒原也没有丝毫的凉爽。迪伦已经在小屋门槛上站了一会儿，心里万分纠结。现在恶魔已经在屋外聚集，如同飞鸟一样在湖面上空盘旋俯冲，但还没有靠近她。在安全屋的保护下，她可以继续耐心等待。她决定待在这里，平平安安地等着崔斯坦。但如果他还没有走这么远怎么办？要是他带领的那个灵魂岁数太大，走得太慢怎么办？而且，她非常渴望见到他，一想到要等下去—不管等多久—对她来说都是一种折磨。她必须现在就出发找到他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But the lake. She had almost drowned here. Tipped into the water, she'd floundered. Creatures in the deep had toyed with her, tugging, pulling, ripping. If it hadn't been for Tristan snagging the hem of her jeans and hauling her to safety, she'd never have left the water. She remembered the taste of it. Foul, stagnant, polluted. It had been thick, like oil on her tongue. And that had been in her own heather-covered wasteland.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是还有一个大湖挡在前面。她在这个湖里溺过一次水，一下水，她就免不了要扑腾。水下有不明的生物，她上次已经被它们戏耍、拖拽、撕扯过。如果不是崔斯坦无意间抓到了她的牛仔裤，把她拖回了安全地带，她根本不可能从水里出来。她依然记得湖水的味道—腥臊恶臭、污浊不堪，湖水滑过舌尖时像油一样黏稠，而且那一切都发生在她心像投射出的石楠丛生的荒原上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In this new burning wilderness, it was worse. It churned, poisonous and smoking. The surface was a haze; it didn't look substantial enough to take the weight of the dilapidated dinghy, but the boat was there, bobbing gently on the surface. That was a relief. It had capsized so she'd been worried that it might have sunk, or washed up dashed to pieces. But there it was, though, right where she'd left it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而在现在这个灼热的荒原上，情况变得更糟。湖水翻腾、毒烟四散，湖面上雾蒙蒙的，看起来一片虚空，似乎连那条破烂小艇的重量都承受不起。不过船还在，在水面上轻轻荡漾，这总算让她多少有些宽慰。因为翻过船，所以迪伦一直在担心它有可能已经沉下去了，或是年久失修，老不堪用，被波浪撞成碎片了。然而它还在那里，在她当时掉下船的地方。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the middle of the lake.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="湖心。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She sighed as she considered it. There were only two options: wade in there and get it, or walk round the lake. Walking was much more appealing than going into the oily, black water, with the hidden things lurking in its murky depths. But it was a long way. She'd be racing against the sun, and she wasn't at all sure that she would win.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦轻叹一声陷入了沉思。现在的她只有两个选择—要么涉水到湖心上船，要么走路绕过这个湖。选择前者就要在油乎乎、黑黢黢的湖里涉水，而且浑浊的深水中还潜藏着怪物。相比之下，走路对她来说更可行。然而前路漫漫，她必须要和太阳展开一场脚力大赛。她完全不敢确定自己能赢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tristan had thought the best way was to use the little dinghy, despite the dangers beneath the surface. That had to mean it was just too far -- and, in this version of the wasteland, just too hot -- to make it round before dark. And she'd survived the lake's icy waters before. She'd never been out in the black of night.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="崔斯坦以前想到的最好办法是利用这艘小艇，不去管水下的危险。那是因为路程太远—而且目前的这片荒原也太热了—天黑之前根本没有办法绕过这个湖。她以前曾在冰冷的湖水中活了下来，但从来没有在天黑之后赶过路。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So really it was a choice of what was worse: the water or the night?</div>

<div class="line_en">The lake, then. The crunch of her feet on the tiny stones that made up the beach was the only sound as she trotted down the slight incline towards the shore. There were no souls to see this early in the day. They would all be emerging from safe houses, just as she was, ready to cross the lake. She'd thought about them in the long hours as she waited for dawn, as she'd tried unsuccessfully to block out the screaming. She couldn't see their safe houses, but they must be close by, taking refuge from the dark, the demons. Dylan had been glad to be alone in a strange way. The other souls made her uncomfortable. They were eerie… strange. And, though she knew it was ridiculous, she was jealous that they still had their ferrymen, while she had yet to find hers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那么只有选择水路了。迪伦顺着通向岸边的小斜坡一路小跑，耳边只听得到脚踩在岸边小石子上的嘎吱声。天色尚早，还没有看到有其他灵魂经过。他们这会儿应该正像她一样走出安全屋，准备穿过湖区。在等待黎明的漫漫长夜里，在她想挡住外面的鬼哭狼嚎却无可奈何的时候，她也会想到他们。她看不到他们的安全屋，但他们一定就在附近躲避黑暗与恶魔。但其他灵魂让她感觉不自在，他们看起来太可怕……太古怪了。而且，尽管她清楚自己这样想太荒唐了，但她还是非常嫉妒那些灵魂仍然有摆渡人做伴，而她还要去寻找自己的摆渡人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She almost baulked at the water's edge. The lapping waves painted the toes of her trainers. Going any further in meant letting the foul liquid touch her skin, and giving any creatures lurking in the water a chance to snatch at her. Dylan hesitated, chewing on her lip, but there was really no choice. It was go forward or go back. Taking a deep breath, she forced her feet to move.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她差点在水边止步不前。湖水舔着她的运动鞋鞋尖，再往前走就意味着让肮脏的水接触皮肤，送给水中潜伏的怪物一个抓住自己的良机。迪伦犹豫了，她紧咬着嘴唇，但是现在要么向前，要么退后，真的再没有其他选择了。她深吸了一口气，强迫自己的双脚继续移动。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She fixed her eyes on it now. She'd been exaggerating before; it wasn't in the middle, but it was still at least the length of a swimming pool away from her. Her hopes of wading all the way were dashed when another step took her up to her chest, and then her throat. She jerked her chin upright, trying to keep her mouth clear, but the noxious fumes seeped up into her nose, making her gag and retch. She was shuddering with the cold, shaking so hard she almost didn't feel something sliding slowly round her left leg, then her right ankle. Her middle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在她把视线全放在小船上。之前她有些多虑了，船不是位于湖中心，但距离她仍至少有一个泳池的长度。她本来还盼着一直涉水走到小船那儿，现在希望终于破灭了。她又往前走了一步，水就已经到了胸口，接着又没到了喉咙。她抬起下巴，尽量不让嘴沾到水，但是湖面上的毒烟直窜进鼻腔，让她感到窒息、恶心。她冻得浑身剧烈抖动，差点没有觉察出有东西先是缓缓地绕着自己的左腿滑动，接着又到了右脚踝，然后又游到了腰间。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Icy cold. Burning. The two sensations hit Dylan at once and she gasped. Thicker than water, the liquid fought against each step. It swirled around her knees, then her thighs. Though she couldn't see the lakebed, her feet felt their way along, shuffling over the shifting mixture of sand and stones. So far, so good. It was beyond unpleasant, but she was still on her feet, and she'd yet to feel the grabbing claws of any creatures hiding down there. A few steps further in and she had to lift her hands clear of the surface. The tar-like water lapped at her middle and she felt nauseous. She hoped she'd reach the little boat before she had to resort to swimming.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dylan whirled in the water, kicking and slapping and flailing. Droplets of oily black splashed up, landing in her hair, on her cheeks. Spray found its way into her eyes and her mouth. Spitting and blind, she wrenched her jumper out of the creature's maw, and launched herself towards the dinghy, trying to swim and fight at the same time. It was ungainly and exhausting, but she managed to stop the creatures from getting a firm grip, and the boat was getting closer and closer. Nearly there. She reached out, fingers searching for the edge of the boat. She had it. Her fingers tightened painfully, but then suddenly she couldn't breathe. Three of the things had sunk their teeth into her jumper and their combined strength was too much for her to shake free.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Shit! What's that?" she shrieked. Her arms, still aloft, slapped down to chase away whatever had a hold of her jumper.

Yanking down the zipper, she twisted and writhed her way out of her jumper, then kicked desperately up. Up and up and up. Surely this was too far? Was she going the wrong way -- right to the bottom? She couldn't fight the urge to breathe much longer.</div>

<div class="line_en">They dived, plunging down into the frozen lake, pulling her with them. Dylan opened her mouth to scream just as the water pooled over her face. It flooded into her mouth, thick and toxic. She panicked, blowing out all the air in her lungs, too desperate to clear her mouth to think. As soon as her lungs contracted, they fought to inflate, squeezing and cramping. Dylan clamped her lips shut, fighting the desire to breathe. All the time she was going deeper and deeper. Flashes from before sprang into her mind, but there was no Tristan to save her this time.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dylan lay panting, face down for a moment, trying to feel if there was anything attached to her ankles before she had to turn and face the horrors, but there was no sensation other than the cold. Awkwardly, she clambered round and arranged herself on the hard wooden seat. Her whole body shook, from fright as much as the cold, and her head was spinning. She was soaked, too, her clothes coated in the viscous lake water. But she was alive.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她趴在那里喘了好一会儿。在不得不转头重新面对那些恐怖的水下生物之前，她先努力触探了一下，看看是不是有什么东西缠着自己的脚踝，不过除了冰冷之外别无其他感觉。她艰难地翻过身，重新坐回到硬木座位上。因为寒冷和恐惧，她的身体在发抖，并感到一阵阵眩晕。全身的衣服都湿透了，挂满了黏糊糊的湖水。但所幸她仍然活着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now she had to row. There were no oars, but she remembered there hadn't been the last time… at first. Dylan closed her eyes, reached down between her knees and felt around with her fingers.</div>

<div class="line_en">Nothing. Dylan opened her eyes, stared across the lake. It was at least half a mile to the other shore, and the air was completely calm, no phantom wind to push her gently across, not that she had a sail. And there was no way she was going to try to swim. Nothing was getting her out of this boat.</div>

<div class="line_en">Rowing was hard. Dylan vaguely recalled Tristan laughing at her when she'd asked if he wanted her to take a turn, saying something sarky about not wanting to be on the water for ever. It hadn't looked very difficult when he'd done it, but Dylan was finding it almost impossible. The dinghy wouldn't go in the direction she wanted it to, and trying to pull through the water, strangely misty as it was, was like tugging at the weight of the world. Worse, her hands kept slipping on the oar handles, and she rubbed the skin from the inside of her thumb in the first ten minutes, so that the whole area throbbed. That pain barely registered against the aching in her legs and her back, though. It was very, very slow progress.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="划船居然超乎想象地艰难。迪伦隐隐约约想起，以前曾问过崔斯坦想不想让自己轮换着划桨，当时他还哂笑着冷嘲热讽说不想永远待在水上。他划船的时候看起来毫不吃力，而迪伦现在发觉对于自己来说这是根本不可能的。小船并不朝着她想去的方向前进，而且在烟雾缭绕的诡异水面行船犹如拖着整个世界在走一样。更糟的是，她攥着桨柄的手一直在打滑。她的拇指内侧受到摩擦，一阵阵抽痛，尽管与腿上和后背的痛相比，这种痛几乎察觉不到。划了很久，依然没有前进多远。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She pounded the side of the dinghy, then turned and threw herself back onto the seat, utterly at a loss.</div>

<div class="line_en">About halfway, she came across something to momentarily distract her from her lack of progress, however. A boat passed her going in the opposite direction. It glided along slowly, its inhabitants rippling in the light. Then, once the first boat had passed, there was another, and another. Soon the surface of the lake was awash with tiny crafts, a hazy flotilla creating a fog on the surface of the lake.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大概划到还剩一半路程的时候，眼前的一幕暂时转移了她的注意力。一条船从对面驶过来。船身缓缓划过水面，船上乘客的身影在日光下显得影影绰绰。第一条船刚刚经过，紧接着又驶来一条。很快整个湖面上布满了小船，这一支朦朦胧胧的小型船队在湖面上搅起了一片雾气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Especially when a boat got into trouble. The water around her dinghy remained calm, but Dylan knew without even raising her head that it was happening. First, the noise changed. Rather than the gentle lap of water against the side of the craft and the warped mumble of a hundred conversations, there was a shrill keening. Not the harsh, guttural sound of the wraiths, it was coming from a soul, she was sure of it. Then there was the light. The whispery glow of white from the orbs were barely making a difference to the glowing red light from the sun. But from the direction of the scream, the nearest orb brightened intensely. It was like suddenly having coloured glasses removed, and the world, just for a moment, seemed normal-coloured.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特别是当一艘船遇上麻烦的时候更是如此。迪伦的小船周围水面仍然平静，但她不用抬头也知道正在发生什么。首先是声音的变化—不是湖水温柔拍打船舷的声音，也不是那上百个含混不清的谈话声，而是刺耳的哭号。不是魔鬼发出的那种尖厉的喉音，她敢肯定，那声音是一个灵魂发出的。然后是光的变化—引导灵魂的光球本来发着柔和的光，几乎和夕阳的红光别无二致。但距离尖叫方向最近的那个光球陡然变亮了很多，看上去就好像突然把有色眼镜摘掉了一样，整个世界的颜色在那一瞬间变得正常了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was much harder not to watch these souls, and the wraiths that hovered, ready to tear them from the boat, pull them under the murky surface of the lake. Facing back the way she'd come was the only way to row, so Dylan had no option but to stare in the direction of the boats, trying not to look at them. She tried to keep her eyes on the stern of her own dinghy, but it was hard. The movement fluttered around the edge of her vision, and she had to constantly fight the instinct to raise her eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她很难不去注意那些船上的灵魂以及徘徊在湖面上空的恶魔。它们随时准备把这些灵魂从船上拉下水，拖到浑浊的湖水深处。只有背对着来时的方向才能划船，所以迪伦只有盯着来船的方向，而又尽量不去看这些船。她努力把注意力放在自己的船尾，但是这个很难。各种动静在视野的边缘层出不穷，所以她不得不一直压制抬眼的冲动。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Before Dylan's very eyes, the water rose up, forming a twisted shape that looked from where she was to be a claw. The claw detached itself from the lake, separated. Became a dozen, no, two dozen smaller beings. Like bats.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在迪伦眼前，湖水立了起来，形成了一个扭曲诡异的形状。从迪伦的视角看上去它就像一副利爪。爪子从湖水中分离出来，张开，变成十几个，不，二三十个蝙蝠一样的小生物。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She saw the boat at once. It was directly in front of her, maybe a hundred metres away, and it was rocking from side to side like it was being attacked by a hurricane. It was hard to look at, because the orb floating in the middle of the boat was shining so brightly it stung her eyes. Still she couldn't tear her eyes away. She wasn't supposed to. It was calling to her. No, she realised. It was calling to its soul… but the soul was ignoring it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她快速瞥了一眼那条船，它就在自己前方大概一百米的地方。船身剧烈地左右摇晃，犹如遭遇了飓风袭击。要盯着船看很困难，因为在船中间浮动的光球发着非常刺眼的光亮，但她依然无法移开自己的视线，它好像在召唤迪伦。不，她明白了，它是在召唤自己引导的灵魂……但是那灵魂却置之不理。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As soon as the word was out, she clapped her hand over her mouth, but it was too late. They'd heard her. The lake creatures continued to tug the soul down into the depths of the water, oblivious to the orb, which was now pulsing furiously. Then the wraiths came at her. With no orb, no ferryman, they didn't need to wait for dark to feast on her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="话一出口，她马上用手捂住了嘴，然而为时已晚。它们听到了她的喊声，现在那个光球在狂乱地闪烁，而湖中怪物们继续把那个灵魂往深水拖拽，完全对此熟视无睹。接着那些恶魔们向她涌过来。没有光球，也没有摆渡人的保护，它们不需要等到天黑就可以在她身上大快朵颐了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dylan started rowing manically, hauling the oars through the water as fast and as hard as she could. It wasn't enough. Not even close.

<div class="line_en">"Don't look, don't look, don't look," Dylan chanted, mumbling the words in rhythm with her strokes. She was shaking with the effort of not peeking. Worse than that, she couldn't see where she was going, and she knew she wasn't good enough to row in a straight line. Who knew where she would end up, but so long as she was off the water she'd be happy. She tried to remember how far it was from the beach to the safe house over the hill. It hadn't seemed like a long way; just one hill. Just one hill. Just one hill. She focused on that thought. That, and keeping her eyes shut.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不要睁眼，不要睁眼，不要睁眼。”迪伦随着划桨的节奏小声念叨着。她努力紧紧闭着眼，浑身都在颤抖。更糟的是，她看不见船前进的方向，而她也清楚自己的划桨技术还没有好到可以闭着眼划出一条直线。谁知道自己会怎么收场呢？不过只要离开这片水域，她就谢天谢地了。她尽力回想从水岸到山上的安全屋还有多远，好像不是一段很长的路。只有一座山，只有一座山，只有一座山。她一面聚精会神地想着，一面仍紧闭着双眼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They were still there; she could see them all around her. She squeezed her eyes tight shut again, scrunching up her whole face. Why weren't they attacking? It was hard to take in, hard to believe that they could be so close and not touch her… just because she had her eyes shut? But she had no other explanation. Hardly daring to breath, Dylan reached out blindly and fumbled for the oars. Painstakingly slowly, she dipped them in and started to row. One stroke at a time, she pulled through the water. The growling increased to a roar, but it was a frustrated noise and still nothing touched her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="它们还在，她能看见它们群集在自己周围。她又闭上了眼，紧张得五官扭作一团。它们为什么不袭击自己呢？它们离自己咫尺之遥却没有攻击，莫非这是因为自己闭着眼的缘故？这真让人难以置信，可除此之外她实在找不出其他的解释了。迪伦几乎不敢呼吸，闭着眼睛摸索着寻找船桨。她小心翼翼地慢慢把桨放在水中，然后开始划起来。她努力地划船，渐渐地在水上缓缓前行。那号叫声越来越大，变成了声嘶力竭的咆哮，但声音里满是沮丧。它们仍然没有碰她一下。">查看中文翻译</div>
