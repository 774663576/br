<div class="line_en">Sure, it was big. It looked like a mansion compared to our old house. It was a tall redbrick house with a sloping black roof and rows of windows framed by black shutters.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，房子很大，跟我们原来住的地方相比，简直可以说是一座豪宅。这是一座高大的红砖房，斜斜的黑屋顶，一排排窗子被黑黑的百叶窗勾出了鲜明的轮廓。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It's so dark, I thought, studying it from the street. The whole house was covered in darkness, as if it were hiding in the shadows of the gnarled, old trees that bent over it.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was the middle of July, but dead brown leaves blanketed the front yard. Our sneakers crunched over them as we trudged up the gravel driveway.</div>

<div class="line_en">He took us on a tour of every room in the house. I was beginning to get excited. The house was really kind of neat. There were so many rooms and so many closets. And my room was huge and had its own bathroom and an old-fashioned window seat where I could sit at the window and look down at the street.</div>
