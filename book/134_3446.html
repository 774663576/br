<div class="line_en">Therese Stepped out into the street and looked, but the streets were empty with a Sunday morning emptiness. The wind flung itself around the tall cement corner of Frankenberg's as if it were furious at finding no human figure there to oppose. No one but her, Therese thought, and grinned suddenly at herself. She might have thought of a more pleasant place to meet than this. The wind was like ice against her teeth. Carol was a quarter of an hour late. If she didn't come, she would probably keep on waiting, all day and into the night. One figure came out of the subway's pit, a splintery thin hurrying figure of a woman in a long black coat under which her feet moved as fast as if four feet were rotating on a wheel.</div>

<div class="line_en">They roared into the Lincoln Tunnel. A wild, inexplicable excitement mounted in Therese as she stared through the windshield. She wished the tunnel might cave in and kill them both, that their bodies might be dragged out together. She felt Carol glancing at her from time to time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她们轰隆轰隆地开进林肯隧道。特芮丝从挡风玻璃看出去，产生了狂野的、难以名状的兴奋感。她希望隧道塌陷，夺去她俩的性命，这样她们的尸体被拖出来的时候，还会是在一起的。她感觉到卡罗尔的目光不时扫向她。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="她们往上城驶去。感觉像是在一座会横扫前方的山里，却又全在卡罗尔的掌控中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It doesn't matter," Therese said. She could see freckles along the bridge of Carol's nose. Her short fair hair that made Therese think of perfume held to a light was tied back with the green and gold scarf that circled her head like a band.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“都可以。”特芮丝说。她看到卡罗尔鼻梁上的雀斑，剪短的秀发让特芮丝想起香水瓶对着灯光举起来的景象。她把她的头发用绿色和金色相间的围巾绑在后面。围巾盘在她的头上，就像一条带子一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Do you like driving?" Carol asked without looking at her. She had a cigarette in her mouth. She drove with her hands resting lightly on the wheel, as if it were nothing to her, as if she sat relaxed in a chair somewhere, smoking. "Why're you so quiet?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你喜欢开车吗？”卡罗尔问，但没有看着她。她嘴里叼着一支烟，开车时手轻轻放在方向盘上，好像对她来说是轻而易举的事，好像她正轻松自在地坐在哪里的一把椅子上抽着烟。“你为什么都不说话？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No, I haven't," Therese answered. She supposed she was pale. She had started to have breakfast, but she had dropped the milk bottle in the sink, and then given it all up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“还没有。”特芮丝回答。她想她应该是一脸苍白。她出门前本来想吃点早餐的，后来干脆把牛奶瓶扔在水槽里，一点东西也没吃。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“最好喝点咖啡。保温瓶里有咖啡。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="她们开出隧道，卡罗尔把车停在路边。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then Carol took the thermos herself and poured some into the cup, steaming and light brown.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后卡罗尔自己先拿起保温瓶，倒了点咖啡在杯子里。淡褐色的咖啡热气腾腾的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Carol smiled. "Do you always want to know where things come from?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡罗尔笑了笑：“你一定要知道每样东西的来历吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The coffee was very strong and a little sweet. It sent strength through her. When the cup was half empty, Carol started the car. Therese was silent. What was there to talk about? The gold four-leaf clover with Carol's name and address on it that dangled from key chain on the dashboard? The stand of Christmas trees they passed on the road? The bird that flew by itself across a swampy looking field? No. Only the things she had written to Carol in the unmailed letter were to be talked about, and that was impossible.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="咖啡很浓，而且很甜，给了她力气。咖啡喝掉了一半，卡罗尔重新发动车子，特芮丝还是一语不发。要谈什么呢？挂在仪表板上钥匙圈的金色四叶幸运草上面有卡罗尔的名字和地址，要聊这个吗？要聊她们在路上看到的圣诞树？要聊聊那些飞越如沼泽般农地的小鸟？不。她想说的，只有她在那封没寄出的信中写给卡罗尔的话，但那又是不可能的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They had just driven into a little town and out of it. Now on the driveway that made a great semicircular curve, they approached a white two-story house that had projecting side wings like the paws of a resting lion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她们刚驶进一个小镇，又开了出来。现在她们进入一条半圆形的车道，接近了一幢两层楼的白色房子，房子两侧的厢房像睡狮的脚爪一样伸展。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Behind her, the door closed with a light, firm double report. Therese turned and found Carol looking at her puzzledly, her lips parted a little as if in surprise, and Therese felt that in the next second Carol would ask, "What are you doing here?" as if she had forgotten, or had not meant to bring her here at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她身后的门关上了，发出两声轻微而结实的声响。特芮丝转过头去，发现卡罗尔困惑地看着她，嘴唇微张，似乎感到很惊讶。特芮丝几乎认为接下来卡罗尔会问：“你在这里做什么？”仿佛忘了是她带她来这里的，或者她根本没想要带她来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There's no one here but the maid. And she's far away," Carol said, as if in reply to some question of Therese's.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“家里只有女佣，没有其他人。而且她也不在附近。”卡罗尔这样说着，似乎是在回应特芮丝的疑惑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Do you like the country?" Carol asked as they turned into a smaller road.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你喜欢乡下吗？”转进小路时卡罗尔问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a metal door mat, a big shining brass mailbox, a dog barking hollowly from around the side of the house, where a white garage showed beyond some trees. The house smelled of some spice, Therese thought, mingled with a separate sweetness that was not Carol's perfume either.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="门前有一块金属踏垫，还有又大又亮的黄铜邮筒，一只狗在房子旁边闷声吠叫，白色的车库则位于侧面的树木后面。特芮丝想，房子闻起来有某种香料的味道，又混合了另一种甜美的味道，这种味道和卡罗尔的香水也不同。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's a lovely house," Therese said, and saw Carol's little smile that was tinged with impatience.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Take off your coat." Carol took the scarf from around her head and ran her fingers through her hair. "Wouldn't you like a little breakfast? It's almost noon."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“脱掉外套。”卡罗尔从头上取下围巾，用手指梳理着头发。“想要吃早餐吗？快中午了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Carol looked around the living room, and the same puzzled dissatisfaction came back to her face. "Let's go upstairs. It's more comfortable."</div>

<div class="line_en">Therese followed Carol up the white wooden staircase, past an oil painting of a small girl with yellow hair and a square chin like Carol's, past a window where a garden with an S-shaped path, a fountain with a blue-green statue appeared for an instant and vanished. Upstairs, there was a short hall with four or five rooms around it. Carol went into a room with green carpet and walls, and took a cigarette from a box on a table. She glanced at Therese as she lighted it. Therese didn't know what to do or say, and she felt Carol expected her to do or say something, anything. Therese studied the simple room with its dark-green carpet and the long green pillowed bench along one wall. There was a plain table of pale wood in the center. A game room, Therese thought, though it looked more like a study with its books and music albums and its lack of pictures.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特芮丝跟着卡罗尔走上宽阔的木头阶梯，经过一幅油画。画中是一个留着黄色头发的小女孩，她的下巴方正，和卡罗尔一样。另外经过一扇窗，窗外短暂出现了一个花园，然后很快便消失了。花园有S形的小径，喷泉旁装饰着蓝绿色的雕像。楼上有一条短短的走廊，旁边是四五个房间。卡罗尔走进一间有着绿色地毯和绿色墙壁的房间，从桌上的盒子里拿了支烟，点烟时瞧了特芮丝一眼。特芮丝不知道该说什么或做什么才好。她感觉到卡罗尔希望她做些什么或说些什么，任何事都好。特芮丝观察着那间简单的房间。房间布置着深绿色的地毯，墙边放着可以让人靠着休息的绿色长凳，还有一张素面的白色木头桌，特芮丝想，这里应该是休闲室，看起来也很像书房，里面摆放着书本和唱片，但一张照片都没有。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Therese looked into the room opposite. It had flowered cotton upholstery and plain blond woodwork like the table in the other room. There was a long plain mirror over the dressing table, and throughout a look of sunlight, though no sunlight was in the room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特芮丝往对面的房间看进去。房间里有花朵纹样的棉布装饰的家具，还有简单的淡色木家具，很像另一间房间里的桌子。梳妆台上有一面简单的长镜子，房间采光很好，但实际上房间里并没有阳光直接射入。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"My favorite room," Carol said, walking out of it. "But that's my room over there."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我最喜欢这个房间。”卡罗尔说，然后走了出来。“可是我的房间在那里。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The bed was a double bed. And there were military brushes on the dark bureau across the room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="房里摆着双人床，另一头的黑色柜子上摆着男用衣刷。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Carol opened a wall panel in the hall. "Yes," she said. "Would you like a coke?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡罗尔打开走廊上的壁柜。“对，”她说，“你想喝可乐吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The hum of the refrigerator came louder now. Through all the house, there was no sound but those they made. Therese did not want the cold drink, but she took the bottle and carried it downstairs after Carol, through the kitchen and into the back garden she had seen from the window. Beyond the fountain were a lot of plants some three feet high and wrapped in burlap bags that looked like something, standing there in a group, Therese thought, but she didn't know what. Carol tightened a string that the wind had loosened. Stooped in the heavy wool skirt and the blue cardigan sweater, her figure looked solid and strong, like her face, but not like her slender ankles. Carol seemed oblivious of her for several minutes, walking about slowly, planting her moccasined feet firmly, as if in the cold flowerless garden she was at last comfortable. It was bitterly cold without a coat, but because Carol seemed oblivious of that, too, Therese tried to imitate her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="冰箱的嗡嗡声现在更清楚了。整个房子里只有她们两人制造出的声音。特芮丝不想喝冷饮，但她还是拿了可乐，跟在卡罗尔后面下楼，走过厨房，进入她刚刚看到的后花园。喷泉后面种了各种植物，大多三英尺高，套着看起来不晓得像什么东西的粗布袋，成群矗立在那里。特芮丝想不出来这些粗布袋到底像什么。卡罗尔把风中松动的系线绑紧。她穿着厚重的羊毛裙和蓝色羊毛衫，弯下身子，看来结实强壮，就像她的脸一样，但又和细瘦的脚踝不同。有好一阵子，卡罗尔似乎忘了她的存在，她慢慢走着，穿着软底鞋的足部重重踱着，仿佛在这个寒冷的、没有花朵的花园里，她终于有了舒适的感觉。天气很冷，没有穿外套的话寒气刺骨，但卡罗尔好像也不以为意，特芮丝也试着有样学样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Therese glanced in vain for a picture of him. There was a picture of Carol on the dressing table, holding up a small girl with blond hair. And a picture of a woman with dark curly hair, smiling broadly, in a silver frame.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特芮丝搜寻着她丈夫的照片，但没看见。梳妆台上有一张卡罗尔的照片，照片里她抱着一个金发小女孩。还有一张镶银框的照片，照片里是个留着黑色卷发的女人，笑得很开怀。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"And how do you like your job?" Carol asked in the kitchen, still with her air of remoteness. She was looking into the big refrigerator. She lifted out two plates covered with wax paper. "I wouldn't mind some lunch, would you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你喜欢你的工作吗？”卡罗尔在厨房问道，她说话的语气还是带着一种距离感。她看着大冰箱里面，翻出两个盖着蜡纸的盘子。“我不介意吃点午餐，你呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“不了，谢谢你。我没有偷过东西，但我相信偷东西一点也不难。在那边到处可以看见别人的皮包，只要拿点东西就够了。别人也会偷你买的晚餐肉。”特芮丝笑了起来。她和卡罗尔一起为这件事发笑。和卡罗尔在一起，什么事都好笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They had sliced cold chicken, cranberry sauce, green olives, and crisp white celery. But Carol left her lunch and went into the living room.

Carol sat listening relaxed and motionless, not even sipping the new glass of whisky and water. Therese played the C major Sonata, which was slowish and rather simple, full of broken octaves, but it struck her as dull, then pretentious in the trill parts, and she stopped. It was suddenly too much, her hands on the keyboard that she knew Carol played, Carol watching her with her eyes half closed, Carol's, whole house around her, and the music that made her abandon herself, made her-defenseless. With a gasp, she dropped her hands in her lap.</div>

<div class="line_en">Therese could hear Carol's voice in the hall. She did not want to hear what she was saying. She got up and put her skirt and her shoes on. Now she saw what Carol had held in her hand. It was a shoehorn of tan-colored wood. Anyone else would have thrown it, Therese thought. Then she knew one word for what she felt about Carol: pride. She heard Carol's voice repeating the same tones, and now opening the door to leave, she heard the words, "I have a guest," for the third time calmly presented as a barrier.
