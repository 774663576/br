<div class="line_en">But Sonja loved Ernest so unconditionally that Ove managed to keep this kind of perfectly sensible observation to himself. He knew better than to speak ill of what she loved; after all he understood very keenly how it was to receive her love when no one else could understand why he was worthy of it. So he and Ernest learned to get along reasonably well when they visited the cottage in the forest, apart from the fact that Ernest bit Ove once when he sat on his tail on one of the kitchen chairs. Or at least they learned to keep their distance. Just like Ove and Sonja's father.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但索雅无条件地爱恩斯特，所以欧维学会了把这种理性思辨深藏在心里。她喜欢的，他知道说坏话没有好果子吃，虽没人理解，他自己最清楚缘何得到她的爱。于是，在拜访森林木屋时，他和恩斯特都学会了容忍对方的存在——除了有一次，欧维往厨房凳上坐的时候，压到了恩斯特的尾巴，被咬了一口。或者说，他们学会了与对方保持距离，恰如欧维和索雅的爸爸那样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ove didn't dislike this cat in particular. It's just that he didn't much like cats in general. He'd always perceived them as untrustworthy. Especially when, as in the case of Ernest, they were as big as mopeds. It was actually quite difficult to determine whether he was just an unusually large cat or an outstandingly small lion. And you should never befriend something if there's a possibility it may take a fancy to eating you in your sleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="也不是欧维特别不喜欢这只猫，而是他根本就不喜欢猫。他总是认为它们非常不值得信任。特别是当它们——比如恩斯特这样——长得跟助动车那么大的时候。实际上很难下定论，这到底是只出奇大的猫，还是只出奇小的狮子。不要跟搞不清会不会趁你睡着时把你吃掉的东西交朋友，这是欧维的人生哲学。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ove learned to fish. In the two autumns that followed their first visit, the roof of the house for the first time ever did not leak. And the truck started every time the key was turned without as much as a splutter. Of course Sonja's father was not openly grateful about this. But on the other hand he never again brought up his reservations about Ove "being from town." And this, from Sonja's father, was as good a proof of affection as any.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维从来没学会钓鱼。但自从索雅第一次带欧维来森林木屋，两个秋天来了又去，屋顶从造好以来还头一回没漏水。而那辆卡车，只要有人转钥匙，就一定能发动起来，都不带咳嗽一声。关于这些，索雅的爸爸从没有开口道过谢。但他再也没有提欧维“从城里来”这档子事。对索雅的爸爸来说，这就算是最真诚的情感流露了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Even if Ove's view was that this Cat Annoyance was not entitled to sit on one chair and spread his tail over another, he let it go. For Sonja's sake.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哪怕欧维坚持认为这该死的猫崽子本无权自己坐一个凳子，还用尾巴占一个，但为了索雅，他只好作罢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Two springs passed and two summers. And in the third year, one cool June night, Sonja's father died. And Ove had never seen anyone cry like Sonja cried then. The first few days she hardly got out of bed. Ove, for someone who had run into death as much as he had in his life, had a very paltry relationship to his feelings about it, and he pushed it all away in some confusion in the kitchen of the forest cottage. The pastor from the village church came by and ran through the details of the burial.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两番春夏之后，在第三年，一个凉爽的六月夜晚，索雅的爸爸死了。欧维从未见过谁哭成索雅那样。头两天，她几乎下不了床。也曾遭遇死亡多次的欧维，与围绕死亡产生的情感之间仅有些微不足道的关系，他只能在森林木屋的厨房里无助地消磨时间。镇上教堂里的牧师来交代了一下葬礼的细节。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ove nodded. Didn't know what he was expected to say to that one. Then he went outside to see if anything on the truck needed fiddling with.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维点点头，不知道他想要怎样的回答。于是，他出了门，去检查卡车有没有什么毛病要修。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On the fourth day Sonja got out of bed and started cleaning the cottage with such frenetic energy that Ove kept out of her way, in the way that insightful folk avoid an oncoming tornado. He meandered about the farm, looking for things to do. He rebuilt the woodshed, which had collapsed in one of the winter storms. In the coming days he filled it with newly cut wood. Mowed the grass. Lopped overhanging branches from the surrounding forest. Late on the evening of the sixth day they called from the grocery store.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第四天，索雅下了床，开始疯狂地清扫木屋，欧维像未卜先知的人躲避一场即将到来的龙卷风一样保持着距离。他在院子里四处寻找可以让自己忙活一阵的事做，修补春季风暴中破损的木棚。第五天，他在里面装满新砍的柴。修剪草皮，砍掉从树林里长过界的树枝。第六天晚上，杂货店打来电话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"A good man," stated the pastor succinctly and pointed at one of the photos of Sonja and her father on the living room wall.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ove drove faster than he had ever driven on the roads that night. Sonja held Ernest's big head in her hands all the way. He was still breathing when they made it to the vet, but his injuries were far too serious, the loss of blood too great.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维从没有比当晚更快地在路上开过车。一路上索雅都捧着恩斯特的大脑袋。到兽医院的时候，它还在呼吸，但伤势太重，失血过多。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After two hours crouching at his side in the operating room, Sonja kissed the cat's wide brow and whispered, "Good-bye, darling Ernest." And then, as if the words were coming out of her mouth wrapped in whisks of cloud: "And good-bye to you, my darling father."</div>

<div class="line_en">They stood in silence for a long time, with their arms around each other. And at long last she lifted her face towards his, and looked into his eyes with great seriousness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们沉默地站了很久，彼此拥抱着。最后她抬起头面向他，严肃地注视着他的眼睛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And then Ove lied to her for the second -- and last -- time: he said that he would. Even though he knew it wasn't possible for him to love her any more than he already did.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是欧维对她撒了谎，说他会的。尽管他心里很清楚，他已经不可能比现在更爱她了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You have to love me twice as much now," she said.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我失去太多了，欧维。感觉我的心就像在身体之外跳动。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They buried Ernest beside the lake where he used to go fishing with Sonja's father. The pastor was there to read the blessing. After that, Ove loaded up the Saab and they drove back on the small roads, with Sonja's head leaning against his shoulder. On the way he stopped in the first little town they passed through. Sonja had arranged to meet someone there. Ove did not know who. It was one of the traits she appreciated most about him, she often said long after the event. She knew no one else who could sit in a car for an hour, waiting, without demanding to know what he was waiting for or how long it would take. Which was not to say that Ove did not moan, because moaning was one thing he excelled at. Especially if he had to pay for the parking. But he never asked what she was doing. And he always waited for her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们把恩斯特葬在他曾和索雅的爸爸垂钓的那个鱼塘边。牧师也在，还念了悼词。之后，欧维把行李装上萨博，让索雅把头靠在他的肩膀上，两人沿着小路返城。他们在回城路上的第一个小镇短暂停留。索雅要在那里见一个人。欧维不知道是谁。这是他身上最让她欣赏的品质之一，她后来这样说。她不知道还有谁可以在车里等上整整一个小时而不追问自己究竟在等什么或者要等多长时间。欧维并不是不抱怨，天知道他有多会抱怨，特别是需要付停车费的时候。但他从不多过问她的去向，总是会等她。">查看中文翻译</div>
