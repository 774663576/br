<div class="line_en">The Fiat skirted the town of Trapani and took a road along the beach. Michael Corleone and Stefano Andolini came to a villa, larger than most, with three outlying houses. There was a wall around the villa with only a gap left on the beach side. The gate to the villa was guarded by two men, and just inside Michael could see a wide fat man dressed in clothes that looked alien in this landscape: a sport jacket and slacks with an open, knit polo shirt. As they waited for the gate to open Michael saw the grin on the man's broad face and was astonished to see it was Peter Clemenza.</div>

<div class="line_en">Clemenza was the chief underling of Michael Corleone's father back in America. What was he doing here? Michael had last seen him that fatal night when Clemenza had planted the gun he had used to assassinate the police captain and the Turk, Sollozzo. He had remembered the look of pity and sadness on Clemenza's face at that moment over two years ago. Now Clemenza was genuinely overjoyed to see Michael. He pulled him out of the tiny Fiat and almost crushed him in a bear hug.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Michael, it's great to see you. I've been waiting for years to tell you how proud I am of you. What a great job you did. And now all your troubles are over. In a week you'll be with the family, there'll be a great feast. Everybody's waiting for you, Mikey." He stared into Michael's face fondly while holding him within his two massive arms, and as he did so he made an assessment. This was no longer just the young war hero. During his time in Sicily the boy had grown into a man. That is to say, Michael's face was no longer open; it had the proud closed look of the born Sicilian. Michael was ready to take his rightful place in the family.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“迈克尔，看见你真是太好啦。我等了好多年，就是想告诉你，我为你感到骄傲，你干了一件了不起的事。现在你的麻烦已经过去，再过一个星期，你就要和家人团聚了，他们要为你摆宴接风呢。大家都在等着你，米奇。”他用强劲的臂膀搂着迈克尔，兴致勃勃地看着他的面孔，还作出了自己的评估。眼前这个人已经不只是个战争中的年轻英雄了。在西西里的这段时间，他已经从一个毛头小伙子长成了男子汉。也就是说，迈克尔脸上表现出西西里人那骄傲而又含蓄的神情，原先的稚气已经荡然无存。迈克尔已经可以在家族中获得他应得的地位了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Michael was happy to see Clemenza's huge, bulky form, his broad heavily featured face. He asked for news of his family. His father had recovered from the assassination attempt, but his health was not good. Clemenza shook his head mournfully. "It never does anybody any good when they get holes punched in their body, no matter how good they recover. But it's not the first time your father was shot. He's like an ox. He'll be okay. Sonny getting killed, that's what did the damage to him and your mother. It was brutal, Mikey -- they cut him to pieces with machine guns. That wasn't right, they didn't have to do that. That was spite work. But we're making plans. Your father will tell you when we get you home. Everybody is happy you're coming back."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔看见克莱门扎高大魁梧的身躯和轮廓分明的大脸庞，心里非常高兴。他询问了家里的情况。他父亲遇刺后身体已经恢复，但健康状况不太好。克莱门扎忧伤地摇摇头。“任何人身上被打出窟窿都是麻烦事，无论你恢复得多好。不过这已经不是你父亲第一次遇刺了。他就像一头公牛，他会没事的。桑尼被打死了，这才是对他和你母亲最大的伤害。太残忍了，米奇，他们用机枪把他打成了碎片。这太过分了。他们根本就用不着这么干，太可耻了。不过我们也正在制订计划。回家之后，你父亲会告诉你的。听说你就要回去了，大家都很高兴。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Stefano Andolini nodded to Clemenza; they obviously had met before. He shook hands with Michael and said he had to leave -- there were things he had to do back in Montelepre. "Remember this, whatever you may hear," he said, "that I always remained faithful to Turi Guiliano and that he trusted me to the end. If he is betrayed it is not I who will have betrayed him." He stuttered with sincerity. "And I will not betray you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯特凡·安多里尼朝克莱门扎点点头，显然他们以前见过面。他和迈克尔握握手，说他要告辞了——他必须回蒙特莱普雷去处理一些事情。“无论你听到什么，”他说道，“都要记住这一点，我将永远忠于图里·吉里安诺，他可以永远信任我。如果他遭到背叛，背叛他的人肯定不会是我。”他有点口吃，但充满诚意，“我不会背叛你们。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Clemenza led Michael across the open grounds to the main villa. There were armed men patrolling the walls and on the beach where the estate was open to the sea. A small dock stretched toward the faraway coast of Africa, and tethered to the dock was a large sleek motorboat flying the flag of Italy.</div>

Fishing boats with bright blue and red sails bobbed on the horizon like balls skipping over the water. There was a small table on the terrace covered with a heavy dark brown cloth, and the two men sat on the chairs around it. There was a pot of espresso and a jug of red wine.</div>

<div class="line_en">Michael said, "Jesus." He remembered the precautions Don Croce had taken around the hotel. "I think that was our friend Guiliano. I hope you and my father know what you're doing. I'm so tired I can't think."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔说：“天哪。”他想起了唐·克罗切在饭店四周采取的防范措施，“我想那是我们的朋友吉里安诺干的。我希望你和我父亲能知道自己在干什么。我太累，脑子转不动了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Clemenza said, "A courier comes by air every day to Tunis and I go over by boat to talk to him. Those were my orders yesterday. At first Don Croce was supposed to help us, or so your father told me before I left the States. But you know what happened in Palermo after you left yesterday? Somebody tried to knock off Croce. They came over the wall of the garden and killed four of his bodyguards. But Croce got away. So what the hell is going on?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克莱门扎说：“每天都有信使飞往突尼斯，我乘船过去和他交谈。这是我昨天接到的指令。原本是想让唐·克罗切帮助我们的，这是我离开美国的时候你父亲跟我说的。可是你知道你昨天离开巴勒莫之后，那里发生了什么？有人企图暗杀克罗切。他们从花园翻墙进去，杀了四个保镖。不过克罗切躲过了一劫。那么这究竟是怎么回事呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Michael undressed and got into bed. He had not slept for over thirty hours and yet his mind jumped and would not let his body rest. He could feel the heat of the morning sun though he had closed the heavy wooden shutters. There was a heavy fragrance of flowers and lemon trees. His mind worked over the events of the past few days. How did Pisciotta and Andolini move around so freely? Why did Guiliano seem to have decided Don Croce was his enemy at this most inappropriate of times? Such an error was not Sicilian. After all, the man had lived seven years in the mountains as an outlaw. Enough was enough. He must want to live a better life -- not possible here, but certainly in America. And he definitely had such plans or he would not be sending his fiancee, pregnant, to America before him. The clarifying thought struck him that the answer to all this mystery was that Guiliano was bent on fighting one last battle. That he did not fear to die here on his native ground. There were plans and conspiracies spinning out to their final conclusions that he, Michael, could not be aware of, and so he must be wary. For Michael Corleone did not want to die in Sicily. He was not part of this particular myth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔脱下衣服就上了床，他已经有三十多个小时没合眼了，可是他的大脑中思绪起伏，不让身体休息。虽然放下了厚厚的木制百叶窗，他依然能感觉到早晨就已火辣辣的太阳，空气中浮动着浓郁的花香和柠檬树的清香。他在思考过去几天中发生的事情。皮肖塔和安多里尼的行动怎么能如此自由？在一个最不当的时机，吉里安诺为什么认定唐·克罗切是他的敌人？这样的错误有悖于西西里人的特点。这个人已经在山里当了七年土匪，想必已经当够了，他肯定希望过好一点的生活——在这里是不可能的，但在美国没问题。他肯定有这样的计划，否则他不会让已经怀孕的未婚妻先去美国。他的思路清晰起来，这些谜团的答案是：吉里安诺准备进行最后的一搏。他并不害怕死在自己的国家。各种策划和阴谋很快会见分晓，而他迈克尔是被蒙在鼓里的，所以必须谨慎从事。他迈克尔·柯里昂可不想死在西西里。在这个特定的传奇里，他是个局外人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The room was full of huge rustic furniture. There was a table on which stood a blue enameled basin and a jug of water. Over a chair there was a rough brown towel. On the walls were paintings of saints and the Virgin Mary, with the infant Jesus in her arms. Michael washed his face and then left the room. At the bottom of the stairs Peter Clemenza was waiting for him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="房间里摆满了制作粗糙的家具，有一张桌上放着一只蓝色搪瓷脸盆和一罐子水，一条棕色毛巾搭在椅子上，墙壁上画着各位圣人和怀抱小基督的圣母玛利亚。迈克尔洗过脸后走出房间。这时，彼得·克莱门扎已在楼梯下面等他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Ah, now you look better, Mikey," Clemenza said. "A good meal to give you back your strength and then we can talk business." He led Michael into a kitchen that held a long wooden table. They sat down and an old woman in black appeared magically at the stove and poured two cups of espresso and served them. Then just as magically she produced a platter of eggs and sausage which she put on the table. From the oven came a great sun-shaped brown-crusted loaf of bread. Then she disappeared into a room beyond the kitchen. She did not acknowledge Michael's thanks. At that moment a man entered the room. He was older than Clemenza but looked so much like him that Michael knew immediately that this was Don Domenico Clemenza, Peter Clemenza's brother. Don Domenico was attired much differently. He was in black velvet trousers that tucked into sturdy brown boots. He wore a white silk shirt with ruffled sleeves and a long black vest. On his head was a short billed cap. In his right hand he carried a whip which he threw into a corner. Michael rose to greet him and Don Domenico Clemenza took him into his arms with a friendly embrace.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，你看上去好多了，米奇，”克莱门扎说，“先好好吃一顿，这样就有力气了，接下来我们就可以谈正事了。”他把迈克尔领进厨房。他们在一张长木桌边上坐下，一个穿黑衣服的老妪像变魔术似的出现在炉子旁边，倒了两杯浓咖啡给他们端了过来，接着又变魔术似的端来一盘鸡蛋和香肠放在桌上，还从烤箱里拿来一大块皮色焦黄的圆面包。然后她就走进厨房隔壁的房间，对迈克尔的感谢没作任何表示。这时候一个男人走进来，他的年纪比克莱门扎稍大一些，但是跟他长得很像。迈克尔立刻意识到这是彼得·克莱门扎的哥哥唐·多梅尼克·克莱门扎。不过唐·多梅尼克的穿着截然不同。他穿一条黑丝绒长裤，裤脚管塞进一双结实的棕色皮靴里，上身是一件白绸衬衣，袖子带褶，外面套了一件长黑马甲，头上戴着一顶短檐帽。他把右手拿着的鞭子扔进一个角落。迈克尔站起来和他打招呼，唐·多梅尼克·克莱门扎伸出双臂，友好地拥抱了他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Michael awoke in the huge bedroom and opened the shutters, which swung outward to a white stone balcony glittering in the morning sun. Below the balcony, the Mediterranean Sea rolled like a deep blue carpet out to the horizon. Streaks of crimson laced the water, and on these boats fishermen sailed out of sight. Michael watched them for a few minutes, utterly bewitched by the beauty of the sea and the majestic cliffs of Erice up the coast to the north.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔一觉醒来，推开这间大卧室的百叶窗，看见了在朝阳中熠熠生辉的白色石砌阳台。从阳台往下看，波光粼粼的地中海像蓝色的地毯一直伸向水天相接的地方。海面泛出道道深红，出海的渔船正淡出他的视野。他盯着这些渔船看了一会儿，全然陶醉在大海和海岸线北边埃里切巍峨峭壁的美景之中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Don Domenico said gravely but with a twinkle in his eye, "Michael, it is such a great pleasure and honor to me that your father, Don Corleone, has put you in my care. Now you can solve my curiosity. My good-for-nothing brother here, is his success in America as great as he claims? Has he climbed so high, this younger brother of mine I could never trust to slaughter a pig properly? Does Don Corleone really set him on his right hand? And he says he commands over a hundred men. How can I believe all this?" But as he said this he patted his younger brother's shoulder fondly.</div>

Peter Clemenza was his father's most trusted and deadly caporegime back in America.</div>

But I find it impossible. 'Unfaithful' I may be, but only to those who have no honor. Don Croce sells information to the government and to me that is an infamita. No matter how subtle the reasons. The old ways are still the best, Michael, as you will see after you have been here the next few days."</div>

My younger brother and I were working in the fields with my father and Papa gave me a packet of lire notes to bring back to my mother. My brother and I were silly children and we flaunted the notes, we were so excited at having that much money in our hands. Two carabinieri saw us on the road and took away our money and laughed at us when we cried. We didn't know what to do, we were afraid to go home and we were afraid to go back to our father. Then this young man came out of the bushes. He was taller than most men in Sicily and much broader in the shoulders. He looked like the American soldiers we had seen during the war. He carried a machine gun under his arm yet he had such gentle brown eyes. He was very handsome. He asked us, 'Children, why are you crying on such a wonderful day? And you, young lady, you're ruining your beautiful looks, who will want to marry you?' But he was laughing and you could see that the sight of us delighted him for some reason. We told him what had happened and he laughed again and said we must always beware of the carabinieri and that this was a good lesson for us to learn so early in life. Then he gave my brother a huge wad of lire to bring home to our mother and to me he gave a note for my father. I can still remember it word for word. It said, 'Don't reproach your two beautiful children who will be the pleasure and comfort of your old age. The money I have given them is far greater than you have lost. And know this: From today on, you and your children are under the protection of GUILIANO.' I thought that name was so wonderful and he had written it in large letters.

Guiliano was only Michael's age, and Michael was intrigued by the man's fame; he was anxious at the thought that they would finally meet face to face. He wondered what use his father could put Guiliano to in America. For he had no doubt that was his father's purpose. Otherwise the assignment of bringing Guiliano home with him did not make sense.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两天来迈克尔一直在紧张地期待着，因为他自己也急于回到美国的家中。彼得·克莱门扎说起过桑尼遇害的事，对图里·吉里安诺，迈克尔感到了同样的不祥之兆。在他的头脑中，这两个人慢慢交织在了一起，他们的外貌有点相似，生命力顽强，有能力。迈克尔的年龄与吉里安诺相仿，对吉里安诺的名气很感兴趣，想到他们最终将见面，他真有些迫不及待了。他心想不知吉里安诺到美国之后，父亲会让他干什么。他相信这是他父亲的目的，否则派他把吉里安诺带回去就毫无道理了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Michael walked with Adonis down to the beach. The armed guards saluted them both: " Vossia, " Your Lordship. Not one of them showed any sign of derision at the sight of the tiny elegantly dressed Hector Adonis. The motorboat had come back, and now closer to it Michael could see it was almost as big as a small yacht. The men aboard it were armed with lupare and machine guns.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔和阿多尼斯一直走到了海滩。武装警卫向他们两人敬礼并称呼他们“大人”。两个警卫看见身材矮小、衣着考究的阿多尼斯，没有表露出任何不恭敬的嘲笑。那艘摩托艇已经返回。从近处，迈克尔可以看见它的大小与一艘游艇相仿。艇上的人配备了短筒猎枪和机枪。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You must send Guiliano's Testament to America immediately, to your father," Adonis said. "He will know how to use it. He will make sure that Don Croce and the government in Rome will know it is safely in America and then they will not dare harm Guiliano. They will let him emigrate safely."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你必须立即把吉里安诺的遗嘱送到美国交给你父亲，”阿多尼斯说，“他知道有什么用，他肯定会让唐·克罗切和罗马政府知道这个东西已经安全到了美国，这样他们就不会伤害吉里安诺，他们会让他安全地移民美国。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes they have," Hector Adonis said. He put a friendly hand on Michael's arm and Michael noticed how small and dainty his fingers were, like a child's. "Maria Lombardo, Guiliano's mother, gave it to you. Only she and myself know where it is, not even Pisciotta knows."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“给了，他们给你了。”赫克特·阿多尼斯说。他亲切地把手放在迈克尔手臂上，迈克尔注意到他的手那么小，就像一个小孩的手。“吉里安诺的母亲玛丽亚·隆巴尔多交给你的。只有她和我知道东西在哪里，就连皮肖塔也不知道。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"All Sicilians are," Hector Adonis said. "We trust no one and dissemble before everyone. Guiliano's father is certainly trustworthy, but he might be indiscreet. Pisciotta has been Guiliano's truest friend since their childhood, Stefano Andolini has saved Guiliano's life in battle with the carabinieri, but men change with time or under torture. So it's best they do not know."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“所有的西西里人都是，”赫克特·阿多尼斯说，“我们谁都不信，对任何人都有所保留。当然，吉里安诺的父亲可以相信，但是他可能不太谨慎。虽然皮肖塔从小就是他最忠实的朋友，斯特凡·安多里尼从宪兵手中救过吉里安诺的命，但是时间和酷刑是会让人改变的，所以最好还是不让他们知道。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I am blessed," Hector Adonis said simply. "But you see how clever Guiliano can be? He trusts only me with the Testament and he trusts only Pisciotta with his life. Both of us must betray him if he is to fail."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我很荣幸，”阿多尼斯轻描淡写地说，“不过你能看出吉里安诺有多聪明了吧？在遗嘱问题上，他只相信我，但是他却把性命托付给了皮肖塔。只有我们两个人都背叛他的时候，他才会失败。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He saw Michael's uncomprehending look. "It's in the black Madonna," Hector Adonis said. "It's true the Madonna has been in the family for generations and is valuable. Everybody knows about it. But Guiliano was given a replica. It is hollow. The Testament is written on very thin paper and each sheet has Guiliano's signature. I helped him compose it over the last few years. There are also some incriminating documents. Turi always knew what the end might be and wanted to be prepared. For a young man he has a great sense of strategy."</div>
