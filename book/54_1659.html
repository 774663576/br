We'll meet that June note with the money we got there." He paused a moment, "We'll probably have to sell a couple of the cows and their calves to make them July and August notes… maybe even that ole sow, But by the end of August we should have enough cotton to make that September payment… Course we'll probably have to go all the way to Vicksburg to get it ginned, Can't hardly use Harlan Granger's gin this year."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“要是他知道了，他肯定会大发雷霆，这样只会害得他被吊死。只要事情不再恶化，我们就别告诉他。我们可以先拿这笔钱还掉六月份的贷款。”爸爸顿了一下，“或许，我们要卖掉几头牛来付清7月和8月的贷款。到了8月底，我们就应该有足够的钱来付9月份的贷款…当然，我们还要把棉花送到维京伯格去轧，今年恐怕是不能用格兰杰的轧棉机了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Hey, ole Jack," I said, patting the mule as I watched Mr. Morrison enter the side door. I thought of returning to my seat on the steps, but decided against it. Instead I remained with Jack, thoughtfully digesting all I had heard, until Mr. Morrison came from the house. He went into the barn, then reappeared with the planter, a plowlike tool with a small round container for dropping seeds attached to its middle. He put the planter into the back of the wagon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嘿，杰克。”我拍了拍杰克，看着莫里森先生走了进去。我本来还想回到阶梯上坐着，不过最后打消了这个念头。我站在杰克旁边，回想着爸妈刚才的对话。没过多久，莫里森先生出来了。他走到谷仓，拿着播种机出来，把它放到了车后。">查看中文翻译</div>

Then he returned to its front and, bending at the knees with his back against the grill, he positioned his large hands beneath the bumper. Slowly, his muscles flexing tightly against his thin shirt and the sweat popping off his skin like oil on water, he lifted the truck in one fluid, powerful motion until the front was several inches off the ground and slowly walked it to the left of the road, where he set it down as gently as a sleeping child. Then he moved to the rear of the truck and repeated the feat.</div>

<div class="line_en">To escape the heat, the boys and I often ambled into the coolness of the forest after the chores were done. There, while the cows and their calves grazed nearby, we sat on the banks of the pond, our backs propped against an old hickory or pine or walnut, our feet dangling lazily in the cool water, and waited for a watermelon brought from the garden to chill.

The revival ran for seven days and it was an occasion everyone looked forward to, for it was more than just church services; it was the year's only planned social event, disrupting the humdrum of everyday country life. Teenagers courted openly, adults met with relatives and friends they had not seen since the previous year's "big meeting," and children ran almost free.</div>

Then it was a feast to remember.</div>

No matter how low the pantry supplies, each family always managed to contribute something, and as the churchgoers made the rounds from table to table, hard times were forgotten at least for the day.</div>
