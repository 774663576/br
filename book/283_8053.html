<div class="line_en">Emma did not repent her condescension in going to the Coles. The visit afforded her many pleasant recollections the next day; and all that she might be supposed to have lost on the side of dignified seclusion, must be amply repaid in the splendour of popularity. She must have delighted the Coles-worthy people, who deserved to be made happy! -- And left a name behind her that would not soon die away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱玛屈尊去了科尔家，并不感到后悔。第二天，她心里还留下许多愉快的回忆。她打破了深居简出的尊严，这也许可以算是一种损失，但她这次大受欢迎，出尽了风头，充分弥补了所受的损失。她一定使科尔夫妇感到很高兴——他们都是体面人，应该让他们感到高兴！她还留下了一个让人久久不会淡忘的好名声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Perfect happiness, even in memory, is not common; and there were two points on which she was not quite easy. She doubted whether she had not transgressed the duty of woman by woman, in betraying her suspicions of Jane Fairfax's feelings to Frank Churchill. It was hardly right; but it had been so strong an idea, that it would escape her, and his submission to all that she told, was a compliment to her penetration, which made it difficult for her to be quite certain that she ought to have held her tongue.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="完满无缺的欢乐，即使在回忆里，也是不寻常的。有两件事使她感到不安。她把自己对简·费尔法克斯心迹的怀疑泄露给了弗兰克—邱吉尔，心想这是否违背了女人对女人应尽的义务。那样做很难说是正当的，不过她心里的念头太强烈了，便禁不住脱口而出了，而弗兰克能老老实实听她讲下去，说明她很有洞察力，这样一来，她也就拿不准自己是否应该闭口不语了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The other circumstance of regret related also to Jane Fairfax; and there she had no doubt. She did unfeignedly and unequivocally regret the inferiority of her own playing and singing. She did most heartily grieve over the idleness of her childhood-and sat down and practised vigorously an hour and a half.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="另一件使她懊丧的事，也跟简·费尔法克斯小姐有关，这是毋庸置疑的。她自己弹琴唱歌都不如人，为此她确确实实感到难过。她痛悔小时候太懒散，于是便坐下来，发奋苦练了一个半小时。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She looked down the Randalls road. The scene enlarged; two persons appeared; Mrs. Weston and her son-in-law; they were walking into Highbury; -- to Hartfield of course. They were stopping, however, in the first place at Mrs. Bates's; whose house was a little nearer Randalls than Ford's; and had all but knocked, when Emma caught their eye. -- Immediately they crossed the road and came forward to her; and the agreeableness of yesterday's engagement seemed to give fresh pleasure to the present meeting. Mrs. Weston informed her that she was going to call on the Bateses, in order to hear the new instrument.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她朝通往兰多尔斯的路上望去。景色开阔了，只见出现了两个人，是韦斯顿太太和她的继子。他们来到了海伯里，不用说是去哈特菲尔德。不过，他们先走到贝茨太太家门口，贝茨太太家比福德商店离兰多尔斯稍近一点。两人刚要敲门，一眼瞧见了爱玛，便立即从街对面朝她走来。由于昨天大家在一起玩得很快活，令人相见似乎格外高兴。韦斯顿太太告诉爱玛说，他们正要去贝茨太太家，好听听那架新钢琴。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harriet, tempted by every thing and swayed by half a word, was always very long at a purchase; and while she was still hanging over muslins and changing her mind, Emma went to the door for amusement. -- Much could not be hoped from the traffic of even the busiest part of Highbury; -- Mr. Perry walking hastily by, Mr. William Cox letting himself in at the office-door, Mr. Cole's carriage-horses returning from exercise, or a stray letter-boy on an obstinate mule, were the liveliest objects she could presume to expect; and when her eyes fell only on the butcher with his tray, a tidy old woman travelling homewards from shop with her full basket, two curs quarrelling over a dirty bone, and a string of dawdling children round the baker's little bow-window eyeing the gingerbread, she knew she had no reason to complain, and was amused enough; quite enough still to stand at the door. A mind lively and at ease, can do with seeing nothing, and can see nothing that does not answer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈丽特见一样喜欢一样，别人说什么都能左右她，因而买东西总要花很长时间。就在她望着细纱布踌躇不定的时候，爱玛走到门口想看看热闹。在海伯里，即便最热闹的地段，也不能指望看到多少行人。她所能指望看到的最热闹的场面，无外乎是佩里先生匆匆走过去，威廉·考克斯先生走进律师事务所，科尔先生家拉车的马遛完了刚回，信差骑着一头犟骡子在闲逛。而实际上，她看到的只是卖肉的手里拿着个托盘，一个整洁的老太太提着满满一篮东西出了店门往家走，两条恶狗正在为争一根脏骨头而狂吠乱叫，一群游手好闲的孩子围在面包房的小凸肚窗外面，眼睁睁地盯着姜饼。这时候，她觉得自己没有理由抱怨，而倒感到挺有趣，便一直站在门口。一个性情开朗、悠闲自在的人，什么都看不见也无所谓，而且也看不到什么不对自己心意的东西。">查看中文翻译</div>

Emma watched them in, and then joined Harriet at the interesting counter, -- trying, with all the force of her own mind, to convince her that if she wanted plain muslin it was of no use to look at figured; and that a blue ribbon, be it ever so beautiful, would still never match her yellow pattern. At last it was all settled, even to the destination of the parcel.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Very well, I am much obliged to you. My mother is delightfully well; and Jane caught no cold last night. How is Mr. Woodhouse? -- I am so glad to hear such a good account. Mrs. Weston told me you were here. -- Oh! then, said I, I must run across, I am sure Miss Woodhouse will allow me just to run across and entreat her to come in; my mother will be so very happy to see her-and now we are such a nice party, she cannot refuse. --`Aye, pray do,' said Mr. Frank Churchill, `Miss Woodhouse's opinion of the instrument will be worth having.' -- But, said I, I shall be more sure of succeeding if one of you will go with me. --`Oh,' said he, `wait half a minute, till I have finished my job;' -- For, would you believe it, Miss Woodhouse, there he is, in the most obliging manner in the world, fastening in the rivet of my mother's spectacles. -- The rivet came out, you know, this morning. -- So very obliging! -- For my mother had no use of her spectacles -- could not put them on. And, by the bye, every body ought to have two pair of spectacles; they should indeed. Jane said so. I meant to take them over to John Saunders the first thing I did, but something or other hindered me all the morning; first one thing, then another, there is no saying what, you know. At one time Patty came to say she thought the kitchen chimney wanted sweeping. Oh, said I, Patty do not come with your bad news to me. Here is the rivet of your mistress's spectacles out. Then the baked apples came home, Mrs. Wallis sent them by her boy; they are extremely civil and obliging to us, the Wallises, always-I have heard some people say that Mrs. Wallis can be uncivil and give a very rude answer, but we have never known any thing but the greatest attention from them. And it cannot be for the value of our custom now, for what is our consumption of bread, you know? Only three of us. -- besides dear Jane at present-and she really eats nothing-makes such a shocking breakfast, you would be quite frightened if you saw it. I dare not let my mother know how little she eats-so I say one thing and then I say another, and it passes off. But about the middle of the day she gets hungry, and there is nothing she likes so well as these baked apples, and they are extremely wholesome, for I took the opportunity the other day of asking Mr. Perry; I happened to meet him in the street. Not that I had any doubt before -- I have so often heard Mr. Woodhouse recommend a baked apple. I believe it is the only way that Mr. Woodhouse thinks the fruit thoroughly wholesome. We have apple-dumplings, however, very often. Patty makes an excellent apple-dumpling. Well, Mrs. Weston, you have prevailed, I hope, and these ladies will oblige us."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“都挺好，多谢你的关心。我母亲身体很好，真叫人高兴。简昨天晚上着凉。伍德豪斯先生怎么样？听说他身体挺好，我真高兴。韦斯顿先生告诉我你在这儿。‘哦！’我说，‘那我一定得跑过去，我想伍德豪斯小姐一定会允许我跑过去请她的。我母亲一定很乐意见到她——现在我们家里又来了嘉宾，她不会不肯来的。一是呀，请去吧，’弗兰克·邱吉尔先生说，‘伍德豪斯小姐对钢琴的看法值得听一听。“可是，’我说，‘你们哪一位要是跟我一起去，我就更有把握请到她了。“哦！’弗兰克说，‘稍等片刻，让我把手头的事情办完。’你肯相信吗，伍德豪斯小姐，天下没有比弗兰克更热心的人啦，他在给我母亲的眼镜装小铆钉呢。你知道，那铆钉今天早上掉出来了。真是太热心啦！我母亲已经不用这副眼镜了——没法戴了。顺便说一句，人人应该配备两副眼镜，的确应该。简是这么说的。我今天本来打算要做的第一件事，是把眼镜拿到约翰·桑德斯那儿去，可是一个上午总有什么事情来打扰，一直没去成。事情一件接一件，你要知道，我也说不上是什么事。一会儿，帕蒂跑来说厨房的烟囱要扫一扫了。‘唁！帕蒂，’我说，“别拿这坏消息来打扰我。瞧，老太太眼镜上的铆钉掉下来了。’随后，烤苹果送来了，是沃利斯太太打发她的孩子送来的。沃利斯家待我们太客气，太热心了，一向如此——我听有人说，沃利斯太太很不客气，回起话来很冲，可是我们从未遇见这种事，人家总是客客气气的。这倒不是看在我们是他们顾客的分上，因为你也知道，我们能吃多少面包啊？我们才三口人——再说亲爱的简——她简直不吃什么东西——吃早饭时真令人震惊，你要是看见了，准会大吃一惊。我不敢让我妈妈知道简吃得多么少——所以就支支吾吾地搪塞过去了。可是到中午简肚子饿了，还就爱吃这些烤苹果。烤苹果对身体极有好处，因为那天我趁机问过佩里先生了。我是凑巧在街上碰见他的。倒不是说我以前有过什么怀疑——我经常听见伍德豪斯先生劝人家吃烤苹果。我想伍德豪斯先生认为，只有这样吃苹果才对身体最有好处。不过，我们还是经常吃苹果布丁。好啦，韦斯顿太太，我想你已经说通了吧，两位小姐会赏光的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I declare I cannot recollect what I was talking of. -- Oh! my mother's spectacles. So very obliging of Mr. Frank Churchill! `Oh!' said he, `I do think I can fasten the rivet; I like a job of this kind excessively.' -- Which you know shewed him to be so very… Indeed I must say that, much as I had heard of him before and much as I had expected, he very far exceeds any thing… I do congratulate you, Mrs. Weston, most warmly. He seems every thing the fondest parent could… `Oh!' said he, `I can fasten the rivet. I like a job of that sort excessively.' I never shall forget his manner. And when I brought out the baked apples from the closet, and hoped our friends would be so very obliging as to take some, `Oh!' said he directly, `there is nothing in the way of fruit half so good, and these are the finest-looking home-baked apples I ever saw in my life.' That, you know, was so very… And I am sure, by his manner, it was no compliment. Indeed they are very delightful apples, and Mrs. Wallis does them full justice-only we do not have them baked more than twice, and Mr. Woodhouse made us promise to have them done three times -- but Miss Woodhouse will be so good as not to mention it. The apples themselves are the very finest sort for baking, beyond a doubt; all from Donwell-some of Mr. Knightley's most liberal supply. He sends us a sack every year; and certainly there never was such a keeping apple anywhere as one of his trees-I believe there is two of them. My mother says the orchard was always famous in her younger days. But I was really quite shocked the other day -- for Mr. Knightley called one morning, and Jane was eating these apples, and we talked about them and said how much she enjoyed them, and he asked whether we were not got to the end of our stock. `I am sure you must be,' said he, `and I will send you another supply; for I have a great many more than I can ever use. William Larkins let me keep a larger quantity than usual this year. I will send you some more, before they get good for nothing.' So I begged he would not-for really as to ours being gone, I could not absolutely say that we had a great many left-it was but half a dozen indeed; but they should be all kept for Jane; and I could not at all bear that he should be sending us more, so liberal as he had been already; and Jane said the same. And when he was gone, she almost quarrelled with me-No, I should not say quarrelled, for we never had a quarrel in our lives; but she was quite distressed that I had owned the apples were so nearly gone; she wished I had made him believe we had a great many left. Oh, said I, my dear, I did say as much as I could. However, the very same evening William Larkins came over with a large basket of apples, the same sort of apples, a bushel at least, and I was very much obliged, and went down and spoke to William Larkins and said every thing, as you may suppose. William Larkins is such an old acquaintance! I am always glad to see him. But, however, I found afterwards from Patty, that William said it was all the apples of that sort his master had; he had brought them all-and now his master had not one left to bake or boil. William did not seem to mind it himself, he was so pleased to think his master had sold so many; for William, you know, thinks more of his master's profit than any thing; but Mrs. Hodges, he said, was quite displeased at their being all sent away. She could not bear that her master should not be able to have another apple-tart this spring. He told Patty this, but bid her not mind it, and be sure not to say any thing to us about it, for Mrs. Hodges would be cross sometimes, and as long as so many sacks were sold, it did not signify who ate the remainder. And so Patty told me, and I was excessively shocked indeed! I would not have Mr. Knightley know any thing about it for the world! He would be so very… I wanted to keep it from Jane's knowledge; but, unluckily, I had mentioned it before I was aware."</div>
