<div class="line_en">Each knight had his squires, servants, and men-at-arms. Behind them came armorers, cooks, grooms; ranks of spearmen, axemen, archers; grizzled veterans of a hundred battles and green boys off to fight their first. Before them marched the clansmen from the hills; chiefs and champions astride shaggy garrons, their hirsute fighters trotting beside them, clad in furs and boiled leather and old mail. Some painted their faces brown and green and tied bundles of brush about them, to hide amongst the trees.</div>

<div class="line_en">Asha Greyjoy rode in the baggage train, in a covered wayn with two huge iron-rimmed wheels, fettered at wrist and ankle and watched over day and night by a She-Bear who snored worse than any man. His Grace King Stannis was taking no chances on his prize escaping captivity.

<div class="line_en">Her ankle still gave a stab of pain whenever she tried to put her weight on it. Something was broken down inside, Asha did not doubt. The swelling had gone down at Deepwood, but the pain remained. A sprain would surely have healed by now. Her irons clacked every time she moved. The fetters chafed at her wrists and at her pride.

<div class="line_en">And so at Deepwood the kraken's daughter had done the same when she was dumped before the king, bound and limping (though blessedly unraped), her ankle a blaze of pain. "I yield, Your Grace. Do as you wish with me. I ask only that you spare my men." Qarl and Tris and the rest who had survived the wolfswood were all she had to care about. Only nine remained. We ragged nine, Cromm named them. He was the worst wounded.</div>

<div class="line_en">Stannis had given her their lives. Yet she sensed no true mercy in the man. He was determined, beyond a doubt. Nor did he lack for courage. Men said he was just… and if his was a harsh, hard-handed sort of justice, well, life on the Iron Islands had accustomed Asha Greyjoy to that. All the same, she could not like this king. Those deep-set blue eyes of his seemed always slitted in suspicion, cold fury boiling just below their surface. Her life meant little and less to him. She was only his hostage, a prize to show the north that he could vanquish the ironborn.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="史坦尼斯给她留下了他们的命。但阿莎感觉得到，这个男人没有所谓的仁慈。他坚决的赦免了这就个人，毫无疑问。但也绝不是因为不敢杀他们。人们说史坦尼斯很公正…即使他的公正是一个苛刻的、冷酷的审判，那也无所谓，铁群岛的生活已经让阿莎·格雷乔伊习惯了冷酷。不管怎样，她都不喜欢这个国王。他深邃的蓝眼睛常常透露出猜疑，冰冷的愤怒在平静的外表下沸腾。她的生命对于史坦尼斯来说毫无意义。她只不过是他的俘虏，一个向北方人显示他征服铁种的战利品。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">More fool him. Bringing down a woman was not like to awe any northmen, if she knew the breed, and her worth as a hostage was less than naught. Her uncle ruled the Iron Islands now, and the Crow's Eye would not care if she lived or died. It might matter some to the wretched ruin of a husband that Euron had inflicted upon her, but Eric Ironmaker did not have coin enough to ransom her. But there was no explaining such things to Stannis Baratheon. Her very womanhood seemed to offend him. Men from the green lands liked their women soft and sweet in silk, she knew, not clad in mail and leather with a throwing axe in each hand. But her short acquaintance with the king at Deepwood Motte convinced her that he would have been no more fond of her in a gown. Even with Galbart Glover's wife, the pious Lady Sybelle, he had been correct and courteous but plainly uncomfortable. This southron king seemed to be one of those men to whom women are another race, as strange and unfathomable as giants and grumkins and the children of the forest. The She-Bear made him grind his teeth as well.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="北方人会让他失望。制服一个女人可不会让任何北方人敬畏他，阿莎了解这些北方佬，那么她作为一个俘虏将会毫无价值。她的叔叔现如今统治者铁群岛，鸦眼可不关心她的死活。或许对于攸伦强塞给她的老朽的丈夫来说她还有点价值，可“铸铁者”艾里没有那么多钱来赎她。像史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩解释这些没有任何用。阿莎特殊的女性气质似乎冒犯了他。她知道青绿地的男人都喜欢他们的女人身穿丝绸甜蜜温柔，而不是穿着铠甲和毛皮手执飞斧。但是在深林堡，短暂的会面让阿莎觉得史坦尼斯并不喜欢她身穿长袍的样子。即便跟盖伯特·葛洛佛的妻子，虔诚的希贝尔夫人（Lady Sybelle）在一起，他依然显得客气周到却明显的很不适应。这个南方国王看起来是跟女人完全不是一个世界的人，好像巨人、精怪和森林之子一样奇怪而深不可测。“母熊”同样让他咬碎了牙。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Even prisoners have ears, and she had heard all the talk at Deepwood Motte, when King Stannis and his captains were debating this march. Ser Justin had opposed it from the start, along with many of the knights and lords who had come with Stannis from the south. But the wolves insisted; Roose Bolton could not be suffered to hold Winterfell, and the Ned's girl must be rescued from the clutches of his bastard. So said Morgan Liddle, Brandon Norrey, Big Bucket Wull, the Flints, even the She-Bear. "One hundred leagues from Deepwood Motte to Winterfell," said Artos Flint, the night the argument boiled to a head in Galbart Glover's longhall. "Three hundred miles as the raven flies."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="即使囚犯也有耳朵，在深林堡，史坦尼斯国王和他的手下们争论这场行军的时候，她全听到了。贾斯汀爵士和许多从南方就跟着史坦尼斯的骑士和领主们从一开始就反对。但是北方人坚持要打；他们不能容忍卢斯·波顿继续占领临冬城，还有奈德的女儿必须从那个私生子手里就出来。Morgan Liddle， Brandon Norrey， Big Bucket Wull， the Flints，甚至the She-Bear都这样说。“从深林堡到临冬城有一百里格，”在盖伯特·葛洛佛的大厅里，争吵最激烈的那个晚上，Artos菲林特说：“乌鸦飞行距离三百英里。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was only one woman that Stannis listened to, and he had left her on the Wall. "Though I would sooner she was with us," confessed Ser Justin Massey, the fair-haired knight who commanded the baggage train. "The last time we went into battle without Lady Melisandre was the Blackwater, when Lord Renly's shade came down upon us and drove half our host into the bay."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="史坦尼斯只听从一个女人的建议，他把她留在了长城上。“我宁愿她和我们在一起，”贾斯汀·马塞爵士坦白道，这位梳理整齐的骑士指挥着辎重队。“上一次我们不和她在一起打仗是在黑水河，蓝礼大人的影子不知道从哪里冒出来把我们一般的军队赶进了河里。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“这几乎称不上一次战斗，”贾斯汀爵士笑着说。“你的铁民反抗得很勇敢，女士，但我们的数量比你们多好几倍，而且还是攻其不备。临冬城会发现我们来了，卢斯·伯顿的人可跟我们的数量差不多。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"He wants my lands," Asha replied. "He wants the Iron Islands." She knew the signs. She had seen the same before in other suitors. Massey's own ancestral holdings, far to the south, were lost to him, so he must needs make an advantageous marriage or resign himself to being no more than a knight of the king's household. Stannis had frustrated Ser Justin's hopes of marrying the wildling princess that Asha had heard so much of, so now he had set his sights on her. No doubt he dreamed of putting her in the Seastone Chair on Pyke and ruling through her, as her lord and master. That would require ridding her of her present lord and master, to be sure… not to mention the uncle who had married her to him. Not likely, Asha judged. The Crow's Eye could eat Ser Justin to break his fast and never even belch.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他想要我的地盘，”阿莎回答。“他想要铁群岛。”她看的出来。以前在其他求婚者身上她看的出来一样的征兆。马赛自己祖传的领地远在南方而且已经失去，他必须给自己找一个有利可图的婚姻，不然的话就不能继续做为王室的骑士。阿莎听说过史坦尼斯断绝了贾斯汀爵士娶野人公主（wildling princess）的希望，所以他只能把目光对准她了。毫无疑问他梦想着让他坐上派克岛的海石座椅，然后通过她来统治铁群岛，像她的主人艾里那样。这就需要除掉她现在的主人，以确保统治…更别说她叔叔已经把她嫁给了艾里。他没机会，阿莎断定。鸦眼会把贾斯汀爵士吃干抹净不带打嗝的。">查看中文翻译</div>

Southron knights and men-at-arms, the lot of them. Asha would have called them king's men, but the other stormlanders and crownlands men named them queen's men… though the queen they followed was the red one at Castle Black, not the wife that Stannis Baratheon had left behind at Eastwatch-by-the-Sea.

He shivered violently for hours, even when they cut him out of his sodden clothes, wrapped him in warm furs, and sat him by the fire. That same night he slipped into a feverish sleep. He never woke.</div>

Richard Horpe commanded a halt, though the army had advanced no more than a half-mile that day and they were hours shy of dark. It was well past moonrise before the baggage train and rear guard straggled in. Asha was amongst them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天国王的斥候发现了两座湖中间一个遗弃的小农场—一个简陋的小地方，不过只有几件棚屋，一个大厅和一个瞭望塔。Richard Horpe下令停止进军，虽然那天仅仅前进了不到半英里，而且离天黑还有几个小时。当辎重队和殿后部队好不容易来到这里时月亮已经高高升起。阿莎就在其中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Asha Greyjoy would have welcomed a fight herself. One battle, to put an end to this misery. Steel on steel, pink snow, broken shields and severed limbs, and it would all be done.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿莎·格雷乔伊也宁愿来一场战斗，让一场战斗来终结这个悲剧。刀剑相交，血红的雪，破碎的盾牌和切断的肢体。让一切都结束吧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Aye!" shouted Morgan Liddle. "Blood and battle!" Then all the hill-men were shouting, banging their cups and drinking horns on the table, filling the king's tent with the clangor.</div>

<div class="line_en">Yet when light came, the camp woke to snow and silence. The sky turned from black to white, and seemed no brighter. Asha Greyjoy awoke cramped and cold beneath the pile of sleeping furs, listening to the She-Bear's snores. She had never known a woman to snore so loudly, but she had grown used to it whilst on the march, and even took some comfort in it now. It was the silence that troubled her. No trumpets blew to rouse the men to mount up, form column, prepare to march. No warhorns summoned forth the northmen. Something is wrong.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当阳光升起时，这个营地开始醒来，周围依然冰天雪地，万籁俱寂。天空仅仅是由黑变白，却没有变得多明亮。阿莎·格雷乔伊因为腹部绞痛和铺的毛皮下传来的冰冷而醒来，只听到母熊在打鼾。她从来不知道一个女人打鼾声也能这么响，但在行军之中她也逐渐习惯了，现在甚至还觉得有点声音很舒服。外面的寂静才让她感到不安。没有唤醒人们整理行装、列队准备行进的喇叭声，也没有北方人召集部队的号角声。有什么地方不对。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Somewhere ahead Roose Bolton awaited them behind the walls of Winterfell, but Stannis Baratheon's host sat snowbound and unmoving, walled in by ice and snow, starving.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="前方不远处卢斯伯顿正在临冬城里等着他们，而史坦尼斯·拜拉席恩的军队却被雪困住不能行动，被放在冰雪之墙里，还挨着饿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Asha crawled out from under her sleeping furs and pushed her way out of the tent, knocking aside the wall of snow that had sealed them in during the night. Her irons clanked as she climbed to her feet and took a breath of the icy morning air. The snow was still falling, even more heavily than when she'd crawled inside the tent. The lakes had vanished, and the woods as well. She could see the shapes of other tents and lean-tos and the fuzzy orange glow of the beacon fire burning atop the watchtower, but not the tower itself. The storm had swallowed the rest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿莎从铺盖的毛皮下爬出来，辛苦的走出帐篷，将这一晚上堆积在帐篷外挡住门的雪墙推开。当她爬到外面呼吸一口清晨冰冷的空气时，她的镣铐也叮当作响。雪依然在下，甚至比昨天晚上入睡时下的还大。两个湖已经不见了，甚至树林也不见了。她能看到其他帐篷的形状和瞭望塔上的烟火发出的模糊地橘黄色的光，但是看不到塔本身。积雪将他们全部覆盖了。">查看中文翻译</div>
