<div class="line_en">In the time leading up to Max's arrival, another washing customer was lost, this time the Weingartners. The obligatory Schimpferei occurred in the kitchen, and Liesel composed herself with the fact that there were still two left, and even better, one of them was the mayor, the wife, the books.</div>

<div class="line_en">A boy from school, Otto Sturm, was one such person. Every Friday afternoon, he rode his bike to church, carrying goods to the priests.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a small portion of guilt at first, but the plan was perfect, or at least as close to perfect as it could be. At just after two o'clock every Friday, Otto Sturm turned onto Munich Street with the produce in his front basket, at the handlebars. On this particular Friday, that was as far as he would travel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一开始，她心里有些内疚，但这个计划太完美了，或者说不可能更完美了。每个星期五，刚过下午两点，奥托·施图尔姆就会出现在慕尼黑大街上，他的自行车车把上挂着篮子，篮子里放着农产品。但在这个特别的星期五，他只能骑到这里为止。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“蠢货。”鲁迪咧开嘴笑着说，他们检查了手中的战利品。有面包、摔碎的鸡蛋，还有一块大家伙——熏肉。鲁迪把鼻子凑到这条肥美的火腿上，得意地吸了口气。“真是美妙。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As tempting as it was to keep the victory to themselves, they were overpowered by a sense of loyalty to Arthur Berg. They made their way to his impoverished lodging on Kempf Strasse and showed him the produce. Arthur couldn't hold back his approval.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管他们很想保守这次胜利的秘密，但是对阿图尔·贝格的忠心却占了上风。他们来到坎弗街上阿图尔那寒碜的住处，把战利品展示给他看。阿图尔一点儿也不吝惜赞美的言辞。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well," he nodded, "whoever that is, I'm grateful to him." He walked inside and returned with a bread knife, a frying pan, and a jacket, and the three thieves walked the hallway of apartments. "We'll get the others," Arthur Berg stated as they made it outside. "We might be criminals, but we're not totally immoral." Much like the book thief, he at least drew the line somewhere.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好啊，”他点了点头，“不管他是谁，我都要谢谢他。”他回到屋子里，拿出一把切面包的刀、一口煎锅和一件外套。三个小偷走到公寓楼的门口。“我们把其他人都喊来。”当他们走到公寓外面时，阿图尔·贝格宣布，“我们也许是罪犯，但可不是不讲义气的人。”他像偷书贼那样，也在某处画了一条界线。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A few more doors were knocked on. Names were called out to apartments from streets below, and soon, the whole conglomerate of Arthur Berg's fruit-stealing troop was on its way to the Amper. In the clearing on the other side, a fire was lit and what was left of the eggs was salvaged and fried. The bread and Speck were cut. With hands and knives, every last piece of Otto Sturm's delivery was eaten. No priest in sight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几扇门被敲响。有人朝着街道上方的公寓窗户大声喊了几个名字。很快，阿图尔·贝格的水果盗窃团就集结完毕，向安珀河边走去。他们来到河对岸的空地上生起火，把摔碎的鸡蛋打到锅里，把面包和熏肉切成片。他们挥动着小刀和双手，将奥托·施图尔姆的货物一扫而空。眼见之处没有一个神父。">查看中文翻译</div>

They ran into him on Munich Street, on the way home from school on a Wednesday. He was already in his Hitler Youth uniform. "We're going again tomorrow afternoon. You interested?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="喜忧参半的小胜利才刚刚过去五天，阿图尔·贝格又一次出现了，邀请他们参加下一次偷盗行动。那是一个星期三，他们正走在放学的路上，突然在慕尼黑大街上撞见了他。他已经穿上了希特勒青年团的制服。“明天下午我们要再干一场。你们有兴趣吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Don't remind me." But Rudy Steiner couldn't resist smiling. In years to come, he would be a giver of bread, not a stealer -- proof again of the contradictory human being. So much good, so much evil. Just add water.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“别再跟我提这件事了。”但鲁迪·施泰纳还是忍不住笑了。在未来的年岁里，他只会施舍面包，不会再偷盗面包，这大概又证明了人类有多么自相矛盾。那么多的善心，那么多的恶意，只要加点水和一下就行了。">查看中文翻译</div>
