<div class="line_en">"Oh, dear, what does the money matter?" wailed Pittypat, wringing her hands. "I just couldn't believe my eyes, and poor Charlie hardly dead a year… And that awful Captain Butler, making you so conspicuous, and he's a terrible, terrible person, Scarlett. Mrs. Whiting's cousin, Mrs. Coleman, whose husband came from Charleston, told me about him. He's the black sheep of a lovely family -- oh, how could any of the Butlers ever turn out anything like him? He isn't received in Charleston and he has the fastest reputation and there was something about a girl -- something so bad Mrs. Coleman didn't even know what it was --"</div>

<div class="line_en">A cold qualm of guilt assailed Scarlett at the thought of Ellen's consternation, should she ever learn of her daughter's scandalous conduct. But she took heart at the thought of the twenty-five miles between Atlanta and Tara. Miss Pitty certainly wouldn't tell Ellen. It would put her in such a bad light as a chaperon. And if Pitty didn't tattle, she was safe.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一想到母亲听到自己女儿的不体面行为时必然会出现的那种惊惶失措的神色，思嘉便觉得有股冰凉的罪恶感涌上心头。但亚特兰大和塔拉相距有25英里呢，想到这，她于是又鼓起勇起来了。皮蒂姑妈决不会告诉爱伦。因为那样会使她这个监护人处于很不体面的地位，只要皮蒂不多嘴多舌，她就没事了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He isn't brave," said Scarlett perversely, pouring half a pitcher of syrup over her waffles. "He just does it for money. He told me so. He doesn't care anything about the Confederacy and he says we're going to get licked. But he dances divinely."</div>

And if anybody dares say one little word about you, I'll tend to them… Aunt Pitty, don't cry. It has been hard on Scarlett, not going anywhere. She's just a baby." Her fingers played in Scarlett's black hair. "And maybe we'd all be better off if we went out occasionally to parties. Maybe we've been very selfish, staying here with our grief. War times aren't like other times. When I think of all the soldiers in town who are far from home and haven't any friends to call on at night -- and the ones in the hospital who are well enough to be out of bed and not well enough to go back in the army -- Why, we have been selfish. We ought to have three convalescents in our house this minute, like everybody else, and some of the soldiers out to dinner every Sunday. There, Scarlett, don't you fret. People won't talk when they understand. We know you loved Charlie."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你不要难过，”她说，“亲爱的。我知道，你昨晚做了件勇敢的事，这对医院有很大帮助。如果有人敢说你一句半句，我会起来对付他们的。……皮蒂姑妈，你不要哭了。思嘉也实在够苦的了，哪儿也不能去，她还是个孩子呢。”她用手指摆弄着思嘉的黑发。“要是我们偶尔出去参加一点社交活动，那兴许要好一些。也许我们太只顾自己了，总是闷闷不乐地呆在家里。战争时期跟平时不一样嘛。每当我想到城里那些士兵，他们远离家乡，晚上也没什么朋友好去拜访的——还有医院那些伤兵，他们已经可以起床，但是还不能回到部队里去——这样，我觉得我们真有点自私了。我们应当马上收三个正在康复的伤员到家里来，像别的人家那样，同时请几个士兵每逢礼拜天来这里吃饭，好了，思嘉，你不要着急了，人们一旦了解就不会说什么了。我们知道你是爱查理的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Scarlett was far from fretting and Melanie's soft hands in her hair were irritating. She wanted to jerk her head away and say "Oh, fiddle-dee-dee!" for the warming memory was still on her of how the Home Guard and the militia and the soldiers from the hospital had fought for her dances last night. Of all the people in the world, she didn't want Melly for a defender. She could defend herself, thank you, and if the old cats wanted to squall -- well, she could get along without the old cats. There were too many nice officers in the world for her to bother about what old women said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="本来思嘉根本不着急，倒是对于媚兰在她头发里摆弄的那两只手有点不耐烦了。她真想使劲将脑袋一摆，说一声：“简直是胡扯！”因为她还清楚地记得，昨晚那些乡团队员、民兵和住院的伤兵曾怎样急着要跟她跳舞。在这世界上谁都可以充挡她的保护人，就是不要媚兰。她能保护自己的，谢谢你了。如果那不怀好意的老婆子硬要大喊大叫——好吧，没有她们她也会照样活下去，世界上有那么多漂亮的军官，干吗她还要为这些老婆子的叫嚷发愁呢！">查看中文翻译</div>

It was that he intended to be asked into Pittypat's house and knew unerringly how to get the invitation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="由于心情激动，别的人好像谁也不曾想起巴特勒船长没有把思嘉的戒指也退回来。但思嘉想到了，而且很恼火。她知道那不是由于巴特勒船长为人高尚而促使他做出这样一个豪侠的举动。而是因为他希望获得邀请到皮蒂帕特家里来，并且精确无误地算准了怎样才能得到这一邀请。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I was greatly disturbed to hear of your recent conduct," ran Ellen's letter and Scarlett, who was reading it at the table, scowled. Bad news certainly traveled swiftly. She had often heard in Charleston and Savannah that Atlanta people gossiped more and meddled in other people's business more than any other people in the South, and now she believed it. The bazaar had taken place Monday night and today was only Thursday. Which of the old cats had taken it upon herself to write Ellen? For a moment she suspected Pittypat but immediately abandoned that thought. Poor Pittypat had been quaking in her number-three shoes for fear of being blamed for Scarlett's forward conduct and would be the last to notify Ellen of her own inadequate chaperonage. Probably it was Mrs. Merriwether.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我听说了你最近的行为，心中感到非常不安，”爱伦的来信中这样写道，思嘉坐在桌前阅读，不由得皱起了眉头。一定是那个讨厌的消息迅速传开了。思嘉在查尔斯顿和萨凡纳时，常听人说亚特兰大的人比南方任何其他地方的人都更喜欢议论和干预旁人的事，现在她才相信了。义卖会是星期一晚上举行的，今天才星期四呢。是哪个缺德的老婆子自告奋勇给爱伦写了信呢？有那么一阵她怀疑到皮蒂帕特身上，可是立即打消了这种想法。可怜的皮蒂帕特，由于害怕因思嘉举止不当而受到指责，一直心惊胆颤，她是不大可能把自己作为监护人的失职行为告诉爱伦的。说不定是梅里韦瑟太太干的吧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I told you he was a gentleman, didn't I?" she said turning to Pittypat, her smile bright through the teardrops on her face. "No one but a gentleman of refinement and thoughtfulness would ever have thought how it broke my heart to -- I'll send my gold chain instead. Aunt Pittypat, you must write him a note and invite him to Sunday dinner so I can thank him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我告诉过你他是上等人，不是吗？”她回过头去对皮蒂帕特说，一丝明朗的微笑从她脸上的泪珠里透露出来。“只有一位崇高而用心的上等人才会想到那叫我多么伤心——我愿意拿出我的金链子来替代。皮蒂帕特姑妈，请你必须写个条子去，请他星期天来吃午饭，好让我当面谢谢他。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Pittypat was ill and in her bed when Gerald arrived the next afternoon. She sent many messages of regret to him from behind her closed door and left the two frightened girls to preside over the supper table. Gerald was ominously silent although he kissed Scarlett and pinched Melanie's cheek approvingly and called her "Cousin Melly." Scarlett would have infinitely preferred bellowing oaths and accusations. True to her promise, Melanie clung to Scarlett's skirts like a small rustling shadow and Gerald was too much of a gentleman to upbraid his daughter in front of her. Scarlett had to admit that Melanie carried off things very well, acting as if she knew nothing was amiss, and she actually succeeded in engaging Gerald in conversation, once the supper had been served.</div>

To leave Atlanta when life had just begun again and go home and face Ellen! She would rather die than face her mother. She wished she were dead, this very minute, then everyone would be sorry they had been so hateful. She turned and tossed on the hot pillow until a noise far up the quiet street reached her ears. It was an oddly familiar noise, blurred and indistinct though it was. She slipped out of bed and went to the window. The street with its over-arching trees was softly, deeply black under a dim star-studded sky. The noise came closer, the sound of wheels, the plod of a horse's hooves and voices. And suddenly she grinned for, as a voice thick with brogue and whisky came to her, raised in "Peg in a Low-backed Car," she knew. This might not be Jonesboro on Court Day, but Gerald was coming home in the same condition.</div>

<div class="line_en">Scarlett arose at five-thirty, before the servants had come in from the back yard to start breakfast, and slipped down the steps to the quiet lower floor. Gerald was awake, sitting on the sofa, his hands gripping his bullet head as if he wished to crush it between his palms. He looked up furtively as she entered. The pain of moving his eyes was too excruciating to be borne and he groaned.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="思嘉五点半钟起身，这时仆人们还没有从后院进来动手做早餐。她溜进静悄悄的楼下客厅里。杰拉尔德已经醒过来，坐在沙发上，双手捧着圆圆的脑袋，仿佛要把它捏碎似的。思嘉进去时他偷偷朝她看了看。他这样动动眼睛也觉得痛苦不堪，接着便呻吟起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She saw a long vista of picnics by the bubbling waters of Peachtree Creek and barbecues at Stone Mountain, receptions and balls, afternoon danceables, buggy rides and Sunday-night buffet suppers. She would be there, right in the heart of things, right in the center of a crowd of men.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她想象着美妙的远景她好像看见在水声潺潺的桃树溪畔举行野餐和在石山举行大野宴的情景，还有招待会、舞会，坐马车兜风，以及星期日晚上在小店吃晚餐，等等。所有这些活动她都要在场，并且成为其中的核心，成为一群群男人围聚着的核心。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Scarlett turned and tiptoed through the silent hall into the dining room to get the brandy bottle that she and Melly privately called the "swoon bottle" because Pittypat always took a sip from it when her fluttering heart made her faint -- or seem to faint. Triumph was written on her face and no trace of shame for her unfilial treatment of Gerald. Now Ellen would be soothed with lies if any other busybody wrote her. Now she could stay in Atlanta. Now she could do almost as she pleased, Pittypat being the weak vessel that she was. She unlocked the cellaret and stood for a moment with the bottle and glass pressed to her bosom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="思嘉转过身来，踮起脚尖经过穿堂，到饭厅里去拿白兰地酒，这是皮蒂帕特每当心跳发晕或者好像要晕时总得喝一口的，因此思嘉和媚兰私下称之为“治晕药水”，思嘉脸上一片得胜的神色，对于自己这样不孝地摆弄父亲一点不感到羞耻。如今，即便还有什么多嘴多舌的人再给爱伦写信，她也可以从谎言中得到宽慰了。现在她可以继续待在亚特兰大了。如今，她可以根据自己高兴做几乎任何想做的事了，因为皮蒂帕特本来就是个没主见的女人。她打开酒柜，拿出酒瓶和玻璃杯，把它们抱在胸前站了一会儿。">查看中文翻译</div>
