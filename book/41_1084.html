<div class="line_en">When I was a little girl, my father and I had a nightly ritual. After I'd said my twenty-one Bismillahs and he had tucked me into bed, he would sit at my side and pluck bad dreams from my head with his thumb and forefinger. His fingers would hop from my forehead to my temples, patiently searching behind my ears, at the back of my head, and he'd make a pop sound -- like a bottle being uncorked -- with each nightmare he purged from my brain. He stashed the dreams, one by one, into an invisible sack in his lap and pulled the drawstring tightly. He would then scour the air, looking for happy dreams to replace the ones he had sequestered away. I watched as he cocked his head slightly and frowned, his eyes roaming side to side, like he was straining to hear distant music. I held my breath, waiting for the moment when my father's face unfurled into a smile, when he sang, Ah, here is one, when he cupped his hands, let the dream land in his palms like a petal slowly twirling down from a tree. Gently, then, so very gently -- my father said all good things in life were fragile and easily lost -- he would raise his hands to my face, rub his palms against my brow and happiness into my head.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ah, tonight. Well, tonight is a special one, he always said before going on to tell me about it. He would make up a story on the spot. In one of the dreams he gave me, I had become the world's most famous painter. In another, I was the queen of an enchanted island, and I had a flying throne. He even gave me one about my favorite dessert, Jell-O. I had the power to, with a wave of my wand, turn anything into Jell-O -- a school bus, the Empire State Building, the entire Pacific Ocean, if I liked. More than once, I saved the planet from destruction by waving my wand at a crashing meteor. My father, who never spoke much about his own father, said it was from him that he had inherited his storytelling ability. He said that when he was a boy, his father would sometimes sit him down -- if he was in the mood, which was not often -- and tell stories populated with jinns and fairies and divs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哦，今夜。嗯，今夜这个可不一般。他总是先这么说，说完再告诉我。他会现编个故事。他把梦给我。在其中的一个梦里，我成了世界上最著名的画家。另一次，我是魔幻岛上的女王，有会飞的王座。他甚至给过我一个吉露果子冻的梦，那是我最喜欢的零食。我有了魔力，只要我想，挥一挥魔杖，就能把任何东西变成果冻——校车，帝国大厦，整个太平洋。不止一次，我对着猛扑而来的陨石挥舞魔杖，从毁灭的边缘拯救了地球。关于他自己的父亲，我父亲从不多谈，但是他说，他讲故事的本领得自家传。他说他小时候，他父亲有时会让他坐下——得赶上他心情好，不过这种时候不太多——给他讲故事，故事里都是精灵和仙女，还有魔王。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And so, what is my dream tonight? he would whisper, taking my hands. And his smile would open. Because he knew already what dream I was giving him. It was always the same. The one of him and his little sister lying beneath a blossoming apple tree, drifting toward an afternoon nap. The sun warm against their cheeks, its light picking out the grass and the leaves and clutter of blossoms above.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那么，我今夜是什么梦？他抓着我的手，小声问道。他眉开眼笑，因为他已经知道我要给他什么梦了。总是同样的梦。梦见他和他妹妹躺在开花的苹果树下，迷迷糊糊地开始午后的小睡。太阳暖暖地照着他们的脸，阳光辉映着青草、绿叶、头顶上锦簇的花团。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I was an only, and often lonely, child. After they'd had me, my parents, who'd met back in Pakistan when they were both around forty, had decided against tempting fate a second time. I remember how I would eye with envy all the kids in our neighborhood, in my school, who had a little brother or sister. How bewildered I was by the way some of them treated each other, oblivious to their own good luck. They acted like wild dogs. Pinching, hitting, pushing, betraying one another any way they could think of. Laughing about it too. They wouldn't speak to one another. I didn't understand. Me, I spent most of my early years craving a sibling. What I really wished I had was a twin, someone who'd cried next to me in the crib, slept beside me, fed from Mother's breast with me. Someone to love helplessly and totally, and in whose face I could always find myself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我是个独生的孩子，常常也是个孤独的孩子。我的父母相识于巴基斯坦，当时他们都已经四十岁上下，有了我以后，他们决定不再第二次冒险。我记得我看着邻居家、校园里那些有弟弟妹妹的小孩，满心的羡慕。可我也对有些孩子的相处方式感到迷惑不解，他们对自己的好运气视而不见。他们的举止就像野狗，互相抓挠，打斗，推撞，彼此背叛，无所不用其极，而且嬉皮笑脸。他们互不理睬。我真不明白。而我呢，我小时候大部分时间都在渴望着，家里不要只有我一个孩子。我最希望的是能有个孪生姐妹，在小床上挨着我哭，挨着我睡，和我一起吃妈妈的奶。她会无条件地、全身心地爱我，而且我总是可以从她脸上看到自己。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And so Baba's little sister, Pari, was my secret companion, invisible to everyone but me. She was my sister, the one I'd always wished my parents had given me. I saw her in the bathroom mirror when we brushed our teeth side by side in the morning. We dressed together. She followed me to school and sat close to me in class -- looking straight ahead at the board, I could always spot the black of her hair and the white of her profile out of the corner of my eye. I took her with me to the playground at recess, feeling her presence behind me when I whooshed down a slide, when I swung from one monkey bar to the next. After school, when I sat at the kitchen table sketching, she doodled patiently nearby or stood looking out the window until I finished and we ran outside to jump rope, our twin shadows bopping up and down on the concrete.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以，巴巴的妹妹帕丽就成了我的秘密伙伴，除了我之外，谁也看不见她。她是我的妹妹，是我一直希望父母能给我的妹妹。早晨我俩肩并肩地在一起刷牙，我能在卫生间的镜子里看见她，我们一起穿衣。她跟我去上学，上课时坐在离我不远的地方，直愣愣地看着前方的黑板，我总是能用眼角的余光，看到她黑色的头发和白色的侧影。课间休息时，我带她去操场，不管是滑滑梯，还是从攀爬架一个杠子摆荡到下一个杠子，我都能感觉到，她就在我身后。放了学，我坐在厨房的桌子边画画，她也在一旁耐心地涂涂抹抹，要不就站在那儿，看着窗外，等我画完，我们便跑出去跳绳，我们的影子成双结对，在水泥地上蹦上蹦下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">No one knew about my games with Pari. Not even my father. She was my secret.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="谁也不知道我和帕丽的游戏。连我父亲也不知道。她是我的秘密。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sometimes, when no one was around, we ate grapes and talked and talked -- about toys, which cereals were tastiest, cartoons we liked, schoolkids we didn't, which teachers were mean. We shared the same favorite color (yellow), favorite ice cream (dark cherry), TV show (Alf), and we both wanted to be artists when we grew up. Naturally, I imagined we looked exactly the same because, after all, we were twins. Sometimes I could almost see her -- really see her, I mean -- just at the periphery of my eyesight. I tried drawing her, and, each time, I gave her the same slightly uneven light green eyes as mine, the same dark curly hair, the same long, slashing eyebrows that almost touched. If anyone asked, I told them I had drawn myself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有时旁边没人，我们就吃葡萄，聊天，聊起来就没个完。我们谈玩具，谈哪种麦片最好吃，谈我们喜欢的卡通，我们不喜欢的同学，谈哪些老师比较凶。我们喜欢同一种颜色——黄色，我们最爱吃的冰激凌是黑樱桃味儿的，最爱看的电视节目是《家有阿福》，而且我们长大了都想当画家。我理所当然地认为，我俩长得一模一样，毕竟我们是双胞胎嘛。有时我几乎能看见她，我的意思是真真切切地、用我眼角的余光看见她。我想把她画下来，每一次，我都给她画上和我一样的眼睛，淡绿色的，稍微有点不均匀，同样的黑色卷发，同样的大长眉毛，双眉几乎连在了一起。如果有人问，我就说，我画的是我自己。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Some people hide their sadness very well, Pari. He was like that. You couldn't tell looking at him. He was a hard man. But I think, yes, I think he was sad inside.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我感觉，如果我对她的故事听得足够仔细，就一定能对自己有所发现。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The tale of how my father had lost his sister was as familiar to me as the stories my mother had told me of the Prophet, tales I would learn again later when my parents would enroll me in Sunday school at a mosque in Hayward. Still, despite the familiarity, each night I asked to hear Pari's story again, caught in the pull of its gravity. Maybe it was simply because we shared a name. Maybe that was why I sensed a connection between us, dim, enfolded in mystery, real nonetheless. But it was more than that. I felt touched by her, like I too had been marked by what had happened to her. We were interlocked, I sensed, through some unseen order in ways I couldn't wholly understand, linked beyond our names, beyond familial ties, as if, together, we completed a puzzle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对我来说，我父亲怎样失去妹妹的故事，就像我母亲给我讲的先知生平一样耳熟能详——后来，父母送我到海沃德的清真寺，上星期日学校之前，我又把先知的故事温习了一遍。可是熟悉归熟悉，每天晚上，我还是要再听一遍帕丽的故事，仿佛被它巨大的引力俘获了一样。也许这很简单，因为我们有同样的名字。也许这就是为什么，我感觉到我们之间有一种联系，隐隐约约，包裹在神秘里，可又是那么真实。然而，它却不只如此。我能感觉到她的触碰，好像发生在她身上的事，也在我身上留下了印记。我感觉我们是连体的，通过某种看不见的规则，以我无法完全理解的方式，超越了我们的名字，超越了家庭的纽带，连接在一起，就像我们共同完成了一个谜题。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The whole time we talked like this, a fantasy played out in my head. In it, I would save all my money, not spend a dollar on candy or stickers, and when my piggy bank was full -- though it wasn't a pig at all but a mermaid sitting on a rock -- I would break it open and pocket all the money and set out to find my father's little sister, wherever she was, and, when I did, I would buy her back and bring her home to Baba.

<div class="line_en">I remember a minor miracle of a conversation I had had with Baba, about a month back. The exchange was a fleeting bubble of normalcy, like a tiny pocket of air down in the deep, dark, cold bottom of the ocean. I was late bringing him lunch, and he turned his head to me from his recliner and remarked, with the gentlest critical tone, that I was genetically programmed to not be punctual. Like your mother, God rest her soul.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我想起一个来月之前，我和巴巴谈话时出现了一个小小的奇迹。我们吵嘴了，这是久违的正常交流，如同一个小小的气泡，蛰伏在深深的、黑暗的、寒冷的洋底，却飞沫般转瞬即逝。那天我给他弄好午饭时已经迟了，他从躺椅上扭过头，用那种柔中带刺的腔调，说我生下来就带着不守时的基因。像你妈。愿真主让她灵魂安息。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But then, he went on, smiling, as if to reassure me, a person has to have a flaw somewhere.</div>

<div class="line_en">I check my watch as I veer onto the freeway from the Old Oakland Road entrance. It's already half past noon. It will take me forty minutes at least to reach SFO, barring any accidents or roadwork on the 101. On the plus side, it is an international flight, so she will still have to clear customs, and perhaps that will buy me a little time. I slide over to the left lane and push the Lexus up close to eighty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从老奥克兰路的入口拐上高速公路的时候，我看了看手表，已经中午十二点半了。至少还要四十分钟，我才能开到旧金山国际机场，而且还得指望101号高速路上不能有任何事故，也不能碰上道路施工。往好里想，这是国际航班，所以她还得过海关，这大概能让我赢得一点时间。我把车掰上了最内侧车道，将雷克萨斯的时速提到了一百三十公里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">To my relief, he doesn't mention her again. But, some days, he won't stop. Why won't you tell me where she is, Pari? Is she having an operation? Don't lie to me! Why is everyone lying to me? Has she gone away? Is she in Afghanistan? Then I'm going too! I'm going to Kabul, and you can't stop me. We go back and forth like this, Baba pacing, distraught; me feeding him lies, then trying to distract him with his collection of home-improvement catalogs or something on television. Sometimes it works, but other times he is impervious to my tricks. He worries until he is in tears, in hysterics. He slaps at his head and rocks back and forth in the chair, sobbing, his legs quivering, and then I have to feed him an Ativan. I wait for his eyes to cloud over, and, when they do, I drop on the couch, exhausted, out of breath, near tears myself. Longingly, I look at the front door and the openness beyond and I want to walk through it and just keep walking. And then Baba moans in his sleep, and I snap back, simmering with guilt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我松了口气，他没再提她。可有些日子，他一提起来就没个完。为什么你不告诉我她在哪儿啊，帕丽？她在动手术吗？别跟我撒谎！为什么所有人都跟我撒谎？她走了吗？她在阿富汗吗？那我也要去！我要去喀布尔，你拦不住我。我们像这样来回折腾，巴巴踱着步，焦虑不安。我用谎话哄着他，然后拿他收集的家庭装潢手册或电视节目，来分散他的注意力。有时候管用，可还有些时候，他对我的把戏无动于衷。他忧心忡忡，最后歇斯底里，以泪洗面。他狠狠拍着自己的脑袋，在椅子上前俯后仰，抽泣着，两腿哆嗦个不停，再后来，我不得不喂他一片劳拉西泮[2]。我等着他眼皮打架，他一合上眼，我便跌坐到沙发上，筋疲力尽，上气不接下气，恨不得自己也大哭一场。我满心渴望地看着大门，门外一片广阔的天地，我真想走出去，不停地走下去。可是巴巴在睡梦中一哼哼，我便一下子回过神来，因为内疚而脸上发烧。【注：[2]抗焦虑药物。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Hector Juarez lives across the street. We've been neighbors for many years and have become friends in the last few. He comes over a couple of times a week and he and I eat junk food and watch trash TV late into the night, mostly reality shows. We chew on cold pizza and shake our heads with morbid fascination at the antics and tantrums on the screen. Hector was a marine, stationed in the south of Afghanistan. A couple of years back, he got himself badly hurt in an IED attack. Everyone from the block showed up when he finally came home from the VA. His parents had hung a Welcome Home, Hector sign out in their front yard, with balloons and a lot of flowers. Everyone clapped when his parents pulled up to the house. Several of the neighbors had baked pies. People thanked him for his service. They said, Be strong, now. God bless. Hector's father, Cesar, came over to our house a few days later and he and I installed the same wheelchair ramp Cesar had built outside his own house leading up to the front door, the American flag draped above it. I remember, as the two of us worked on the ramp, I felt a need to apologize to Cesar for what had happened to Hector in my father's homeland.</div>

<div class="line_en">It's like seeing the photo of a radio personality, how they never turn out to look the way you had pictured them in your mind, listening to their voice in your car. She is old, for one thing. Or oldish. Of course I knew this. I had done the math and estimated she had to be around her early sixties. Except it is hard to reconcile this slim gray-haired woman with the little girl I've always envisioned, a three-year-old with dark curly hair and long eyebrows that almost meet, like mine. And she is taller than I imagined. I can tell, even though she is sitting, on a bench near a sandwich kiosk, looking around timidly like she's lost. She has narrow shoulders and a delicate build, a pleasant face, her hair pulled back taut and held with a crocheted headband. She wears jade earrings, faded jeans, a long salmon tunic sweater, and a yellow scarf wrapped around her neck with casual European elegance. She had told me in her last e-mail that she would wear the scarf so I could spot her quickly.</div>

She has Baba's grin exactly -- except for a rice grain's gap between her upper front teeth -- crooked on the left, the way it scrunches up her face and nearly squeezes shut her eyes, how she tilts her head just a tad.

I feel a twist in my stomach, it looks so painful.</div>

Other people, though -- especially Afghans -- are always pointing out how fortunate Baba is, what a blessing I am. They speak of me admiringly. They make me out to be a saint, the daughter who has heroically forgone some glittering life of ease and privilege to stay home and look after her father. But, first, the mother, they say, their voices ringing, I imagine, with a glistening kind of sympathy. All those years of nursing her. What a mess that was. Now the father. She was never a looker, sure, but she had a suitor. An American, he was, the solar fellow. She could have married him. But she didn't. Because of them. The things she sacrificed. Ah, every parent should have a daughter like this. They compliment me on my good humor. They marvel at my courage and nobility the way people do those who have overcome a physical deformity or maybe a crippling speech impediment.</div>

<div class="line_en">But I don't recognize myself in this version of the story. For instance, some mornings I spot Baba sitting on the edge of his bed, eyeing me with his rheumy gaze, impatient for me to slip socks onto his dry, mottled feet, and he growls my name and makes an infantile face. He wrinkles his nose in a way that makes him look like a wet, fearful rodent, and I resent him when he makes this face. I resent him for being the way he is. I resent him for the narrowed borders of my existence, for being the reason my best years are draining away from me. There are days when all I want is to be free of him and his petulance and neediness. I am nothing like a saint.</div>

We have lived in this house since 1989, when I was seven, renting it first, before Baba bought it from the owner back in '93. Mother died in this house, on a sunny Christmas Eve morning, in a hospital bed I set up for her in the guest bedroom and where she spent the last three months of her life. She asked me to move her to that room because of the view. She said it raised up her spirits. She lay in the bed, her legs swollen and gray, and spent her days looking out the window at the cul-de-sac, the front yard with its rim of Japanese maples she had planted years before, the star-shaped flower bed, the swath of lawn split by a narrow path of pebbles, the foothills in the distance and the deep, rich gold they turned midday when sunlight shone full tilt on them.</div>

<div class="line_en">When I was eleven, all the sixth-grade classes in my elementary school went for an overnight field trip to the Monterey Bay Aquarium. The whole week leading up to that Friday, it was all my classmates talked about, in the library or playing four square at recess, how much fun they would have, once the aquarium closed for the day, free to run around the exhibits, in their pajamas, among the hammerheads, the bat rays, the sea dragons, and the squid. Our teacher, Mrs. Gillespie, told us dinner stations would be set up around the aquarium, and students would have their choice of PB&amp; J or mac and cheese. You can have brownies for dessert or vanilla ice cream, she said. Students would crawl into their sleeping bags that night and listen to teachers read them bedtime stories, and they would drift off to sleep among the sea horses and sardines and the leopard sharks gliding through tall fronds of swaying kelp. By Thursday, the anticipation in the classroom was electric. Even the usual troublemakers made sure to be on their best for fear that mischief would cost them the trip to the aquarium.</div>

<div class="line_en">For me, it was a bit like watching an exciting movie with the sound turned off. I felt removed from all the cheerfulness, cut off from the celebratory mood -- the way I did every December when my classmates went home to Douglas firs and stockings dangling over fireplaces and pyramids of presents. I told Mrs. Gillespie I wouldn't be going along. When she asked why, I said the field trip fell on a Muslim holiday. I wasn't sure she believed me.</div>

<div class="line_en">The night of the trip, I stayed home with my parents, and we watched Murder, She Wrote. I tried to focus on the show and not think about the field trip, but my mind insisted on wandering off. I imagined my classmates, at that same moment, in their pajamas, flashlights in hand, their foreheads pressed against the glass of a giant tank of eel. I felt something clenching in my chest, and I shifted my weight on the couch. Baba, slung back on the other couch, tossed a roasted peanut into his mouth and chuckled at something Angela Lansbury said. Next to him, I caught Mother watching me pensively, her face clouded over, but when our eyes met her features cleared quickly and she smiled -- a stealthy, private smile -- and I dug inward and willed myself to smile back. That night, I dreamt I was at a beach, standing waist-deep in the ocean, water that was myriad shades of green and blue, jade, sapphire, emerald, turquoise, gently rocking at my hips. At my feet glided legions of fish, as if the ocean were my own private aquarium. They brushed against my toes and tickled my calves, a thousand darting, glistening flashes of color against the white sand.</div>

<div class="line_en">At the aquarium, I wandered gamely through the exhibits and did my best to answer Baba's questions about different types of fish I recognized. But the place was too bright and noisy, the good exhibits too crowded. It was nothing like the way I imagined it had been the night of the field trip. It was a struggle. It wore me out, trying to make like I was having a good time. I felt a stomachache coming on, and we left after an hour or so of shuffling about.

As he spoke, I remembered when I was little and he would take me to the petting zoo at Kelley Park and the Japanese gardens next door to see the koi, and how we would give names to all the fish and how I would cling to his hand and think to myself that I would never need anyone else as long as I lived.</div>

<div class="line_en">The next year, in junior high, girls my age were wearing eye shadow and lip gloss. They went to Boyz II Men concerts, school dances, and on group dates to Great America, where they screeched through the dips and corkscrews of the Demon. Classmates tried out for basketball and cheerleading. The girl who sat behind me in Spanish, pale-skinned with freckles, was going out for the swim team, and she casually suggested one day, as we were clearing our desks just after the bell, that I give it a shot too. She didn't understand. My parents would have been mortified if I wore a bathing suit in public. Not that I wanted to. I was terribly self-conscious about my body. I was slim above the waist but disproportionately and strikingly thick below, as if gravity had pulled all the weight down to my lower half. I looked like I had been put together by a child playing one of those board games where you mix and match body parts or, better yet, mismatch them so everyone has a good laugh. Mother said what I had was "strong bones." She said her own mother had had the same build. Eventually, she stopped, having figured, I guess, that big-boned was not something a girl wanted to be called.</div>

I begged Baba to end the Farsi classes, but he refused. He said I would appreciate later the gift he was giving me.

<div class="line_en">Then there was Sundays, when I put on a white cotton scarf, and he dropped me off at the mosque in Hayward for Koran lessons. The room where we studied -- a dozen other Afghan girls and I -- was tiny, had no air-conditioning, and smelled of unwashed linen. The windows were narrow and set high, the way prison-cell windows always are in the movies. The lady who taught us was the wife of a grocer in Fremont. I liked her best when she told us stories about the Prophet's life, which I found interesting -- how he had lived his childhood in the desert, how the angel Gabriel had appeared to him in a cave and commanded him to recite verses, how everyone who met him was struck by his kind and luminous face. But she spent the bulk of the time running down a long list, warning us against all the things we had to avoid at all cost as virtuous young Muslim girls lest we be corrupted by Western culture: boys -- first and foremost, naturally -- but also rap music, Madonna, Melrose Place, shorts, dancing, swimming in public, cheerleading, alcohol, bacon, pepperoni, non-halal burgers, and a slew of other things. I sat on the floor, sweating in the heat, my feet falling asleep, wishing I could lift the scarf from my hair, but, of course, you couldn't do that in a mosque. I looked up at the windows, but they allowed only narrow slits of sky. I longed for the moment when I exited the mosque, when fresh air first struck my face and I always felt a loosening inside my chest, the relief of an uncomfortable knot coming undone.</div>

Jeremy had laconic blue eyes and a white-boy Afro. He was secretive and brooding. He played guitar in a garage band -- at the school's annual talent show, they played a raucous take on "House of the Rising Sun." In class, I sat four seats behind and to the left of Jeremy. Sometimes I pictured us kissing, his hand cupped around the back of my neck, his face so close to mine it eclipsed the whole world. A sensation would spread through me like a warm feather gently shivering across my belly, my limbs. Of course it could never happen. We could never happen, Jeremy and I. If he had even the dimmest inkling of my existence, he had never given a clue. Which was just as well, really.

<div class="line_en">By the time I was in high school, days at Abe's Kabob House dragged long and hot. Much of the luster that the things inside the restaurant had held for me in childhood had faded. The old humming soda merchandiser in the corner, the vinyl table covers, the stained plastic cups, the tacky item names on the laminated menus -- Caravan Kabob, Khyber Pass Pilaf, Silk Route Chicken -- the badly framed poster of the Afghan girl from National Geographic, the one with the eyes -- like they had passed an ordinance that every single Afghan restaurant had to have her eyes staring back from the wall. Next to it, Baba had hung an oil painting I had done in seventh grade of the big minarets in Herat. I remember the charge of pride and glamour I had felt when he had first put it up, when I watched customers eating their lamb kabobs beneath my artwork.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等我上了高中，在亚伯烤肉馆的日子就变得燥热而难熬。饭馆里那些在我童年时代的眼中熠熠发光的东西，已经大部分归于黯淡。角落里老旧的汽水柜，塑料台布，变了颜色的塑料杯，过了塑的菜单上那些俗气的菜名——大篷车烤肉串，开伯尔山口抓饭，丝绸之路鸡——相框里装着歪歪扭扭的招贴画，是《国家地理》封面上的阿富汗女孩，眼睛特别大的那个——好像颁布了一条法令，所有的阿富汗餐馆都必须把她的眼睛搁到墙上，负责瞪人。在招贴旁边，巴巴挂了一张我在七年级时画的油画，画的是赫拉特的大宣礼塔。我记得他刚把画挂上去的时候，我看到顾客们在我的作品下吃着羊肉串，真感到心里充满了骄傲和激动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At lunch hour, while Mother and I ping-ponged back and forth from the spicy smoke in the kitchen to the tables where we served office workers and city employees and cops, Baba worked the register -- Baba and his grease-stained white shirt, the bushel of gray chest hair spilling over the open top button, his thick, hairy forearms. Baba beaming, waving cheerfully to each entering customer. Hello, sir! Hello, madam! Welcome to Abe's Kabob House. I'm Abe. Can I take your order please? It made me cringe how he didn't realize that he sounded like the goofy Middle Eastern sidekick in a bad sitcom. Then, with each meal I served, there was the sideshow of Baba ringing the old copper bell. It had started as a kind of joke, I suppose, the bell, which Baba had hooked to the wall behind the register counter. Now each table served was greeted by a hearty clang of the copper bell. The regulars were used to it -- they barely heard it anymore -- and new customers mostly chalked it up to the eccentric charm of the place, though there were complaints from time to time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到了午餐时间，母亲和我就像乒乓球一样，在厨房辛辣的油烟和餐桌之间来来回回，招待写字楼的职员、市政员工和警察，巴巴则负责打理柜台，他穿着油糊糊的白衬衫，露出粗壮而多毛的小臂，领口敞开着，一大片花白的胸毛泼洒在外。每有顾客登门，巴巴便堆起笑脸，喜滋滋地招手致意。你好，先生！你好，女士！欢迎光临亚伯烤肉馆。在下就是亚伯。请问可以点菜了吗？我听了直起鸡皮疙瘩，因为他意识不到，他活像低劣的情景喜剧里一个愚蠢的中东配角。接着，我每上一道菜，都会穿插着巴巴摇响老铜铃的表演。一开始，巴巴把铃铛挂到柜台后面的墙上时，我还以为这只是图个好玩，可现在每张桌子上菜时，都会听到铜铃叮当一声，发出衷心的祝福。常客已经习惯了，几乎听而不闻，新客人听了，多半会给这个地方的古怪魅力再添一笔，不过偶尔也有人口出怨言。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">You don't want to ring the bell anymore, Baba said one night. It was in the spring quarter of my senior year in high school. We were in the car outside the restaurant, after we had closed, waiting for Mother, who had forgotten her antacid pills inside and had run back in to fetch them. Baba wore a leaden expression. He had been in a dark mood all day. A light drizzle fell on the strip mall. It was late, and the lot was empty, save for a couple of cars at the KFC drive-thru and a pickup parked outside the dry-cleaning shop, two guys inside the truck, smoke corkscrewing up from the windows.</div>

It is a bit of a marvel how Baba, at times, summons her with such uncanny precision -- remembering, for instance, that she salted her food by bouncing the salt grains off the palm of her hand or her habit of interrupting people on the phone when she never did it in person -- and how, other times, he can be so wildly inaccurate. I imagine Mother is fading for him, her face receding into shadows, her memory diminishing with each passing day, leaking like sand from a fist.

<div class="line_en">A few months before Dr. Bashiri passed me the phone number to a hospice, Mother and I took a trip to the Santa Cruz Mountains and stayed in a hotel for the weekend. Mother didn't like long trips, but we did go off on short ones now and then, she and I, back before she was really sick. Baba would man the restaurant, and I would drive Mother and me to Bodega Bay, or Sausalito, or San Francisco, where we would always stay in a hotel near Union Square. We would settle down in our room and order room service, watch on-demand movies. Later, we would go down to the Wharf -- Mother was a sucker for all the tourist traps -- and buy gelato, watch the sea lions bobbing up and down on the water over by the pier. We would drop coins into the open cases of the street guitarists and the backpacks of the mime artists, the spray-painted robot men. We always made a visit to the Museum of Modern Art, and, my arm coiled around hers, I would show her the works of Rivera, Kahlo, Matisse, Pollock. Or else we would go to a matinee, which Mother loved, and we would see two, three films, come out in the dark, our eyes bleary, ears ringing, fingers smelling of popcorn.</div>

Our room was a cabin with a wooden porch, from which we had a view of the swimming pool, the restaurant, and entire groves of redwood that soared straight up into the clouds. Some of the trees were so close, you could tell the subtle shades of color on a squirrel's fur as it dashed up the trunk.

Iqbal had told this old friend that when he was in Pakistan, he had been receiving money from his older brother who lived in northern California.

<div class="line_en">Pari stays a month with Baba and me. In the mornings, we take breakfast together in the kitchen. Black coffee and toast for Pari, yogurt for me, and fried eggs with bread for Baba, something he has found a taste for in the last year. I worried it was going to raise his cholesterol, eating all those eggs, and I asked Dr. Bashiri during one of Baba's appointments. Dr. Bashiri gave me one of his tight-lipped smiles and said, Oh, I wouldn't worry about it. And that reassured me -- at least until a bit later when I was helping Baba buckle his seat belt and it occurred to me that maybe what Dr. Bashiri had really meant was, We're past all that now.</div>

<div class="line_en">After lunch, the three of us go out for a stroll. We keep it short for both their sakes -- what with Baba tiring quickly and Pari's arthritis. Baba has a wariness in his eyes, tottering anxiously along the sidewalk between Pari and me, wearing an old newsboy cap, his cardigan sweater, and wool-lined moccasins. There is a middle school around the block with an ill-manicured soccer field and, across that, a small playground where I often take Baba. We always find a young mother or two, strollers parked near them, a toddler stumbling around in the sandbox, now and then a teenage couple cutting school, swinging lazily and smoking. They rarely look at Baba -- the teenagers -- and then only with cold indifference, or even subtle disdain, as if my father should have known better than to allow old age and decay to happen to him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吃完午饭，我们便出门散步，时间不长，因为他俩都撑不下来——巴巴很快就累了，而帕丽有关节炎。巴巴的目光中带着警惕，心神不宁地沿着人行道，一步三晃地走在我和帕丽中间。他戴着一顶旧前进帽，身穿开襟羊毛衫，脚上是一双翻毛软皮鞋。街区周围有一座中学，校内有块足球场，草皮修剪得很烂，对面就是我常带巴巴去的小运动场。我们总能看见一两个年轻的母亲，婴儿车停在她们身边，小宝宝在沙坑里东倒西歪，偶尔有一对十几岁大的孩子，旷了课，抽着烟，吊儿郎当地晃来晃去。这些半大孩子啊，他们从来不拿正眼瞧巴巴，就算看一眼，也是无动于衷，甚至带着隐隐的蔑视，好像我父亲的年老力衰纯属活该。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After breakfast, I retreat into my office -- otherwise known as my bedroom -- and Pari keeps Baba company while I work. At her request, I have written down for her the schedule of the TV shows he likes to watch, what time to give him his midmorning pills, which snacks he likes and when he's apt to ask for them. It was her idea I write it all down.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吃完早餐，我就回到自己的办公室——其实就是我的卧室。我工作时，帕丽陪着巴巴。应她的要求，我给她写了巴巴喜欢看的电视节目表：什么时候让他吃上午的药，他喜欢哪种零食，一般什么时间吃。是她让我把这些都写下来的。">查看中文翻译</div>

I keep a steady supply of both.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我没告诉她，她永远也没办法按自己希望的方式了解他了。不过，我还是跟她讲了一些小窍门。比如说，如果巴巴开始焦虑不安，要想让他平静下来，我通常——不是次次如此——会马上递给他一本免费送来的家庭购物目录，或是一份卖家具的广告折页。这两样东西我总是有充足的备货。">查看中文翻译</div>

All my life, I have lived like an aquarium fish in the safety of a glass tank, behind a barrier as impenetrable as it has been transparent.

Why else had I left Neal, the man I was engaged to a few years ago? He owned a small solar-panel-installation company. He had a square-shaped, creased face I liked the moment I met him at Abe's Kabob House, when I asked for his order and he looked up from the menu and grinned. He was patient and friendly and even-tempered. It isn't true what I told Pari about him. Neal didn't leave me for someone more beautiful. I sabotaged things with him. Even when he promised to convert to Islam, to take Farsi classes, I found other faults, other excuses.

<div class="line_en">I get up and go to my room. One of the quirks of never leaving home is that no one cleans out your old room and sells your toys at a garage sale, no one gives away the clothes you have outgrown. I know that for a woman who is nearly thirty, I have too many relics of my childhood sitting around, most of them stuffed in a large chest at the foot of my bed whose lid I now lift. Inside are old dolls, the pink pony that came with a mane I could brush, the picture books, all the Happy Birthday and Valentine's cards I had made my parents in elementary school with kidney beans and glitter and little sparkling stars. The last time we spoke, Neal and I, when I broke things off, he said, I can't wait for you, Pari. I won't wait around for you to grow up.</div>

I went to Baba's room, but he wasn't there. His bed had been made, his TV was dark, and there was a half-full glass of water on the bedside table. I was a little relieved.

<div class="line_en">Baba blinked. Even before the stroke, he had already started withdrawing, falling into long, silent lapses, looking disconsolate. Since the stroke, his face has become a mask, his mouth frozen perpetually in a lopsided, polite little smile that never climbs to his eyes. He hasn't said a word since the stroke. Sometimes, his lips part, and he makes a husky, exhaling sound -- Aaaah!-- with enough of an upturn at the tail end to make it sound like surprise, or like what I said has triggered a minor epiphany in him.</div>

But when I was packing for Baba, I reached in the hallway closet for the top suitcase, from the stack of three, and was able to fit all of Baba's clothes in it. Then I finally worked up the nerve to clear my parents' bedroom. I ripped off the old wallpaper, repainted the walls. I moved out their queen-size bed, my mother's dresser with the oval vanity mirror, cleared the closets of my father's suits, my mother's blouses and dresses sheathed in plastic. I made a pile in the garage for a trip or two to Goodwill. I moved my desk to their bedroom, which I use now as my office and as my study when classes begin in the fall. I emptied the chest at the foot of my bed too. In a trash bag, I tossed all my old toys, my childhood dresses, all the sandals and tennis shoes I had outworn. I couldn't bear to look any longer at the Happy Birthday and Father's Day and Mother's Day cards I had made my parents. I couldn't sleep at night knowing they were there at my feet.

<div class="line_en">Chin quivering, Pari slowly shakes her head. She takes the box from me and peers inside it. "No," she says. "Only that when we lost each other, Abdullah and I, it hurt him much more than me. I was the lucky one because I was protected by my youth. Je pouvais oublier. I still had the luxury of forgetting. He did not." She lifts a feather, brushes it against her wrist, eyeing it as though hoping it might spring to life and take flight. "I don't know what this feather means, the story of it, but I know it means he was thinking of me. For all these years. He remembered me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="帕丽的下巴颤抖着，慢慢摇了摇头。她从我手里接过茶叶盒，仔细地看着。“不。”她说，“我们俩，阿卜杜拉和我失散的时候，他受到的伤害比我重得多。我比较幸运，因为我年轻小，这一点保护了我。Je pouvais oublier。[15]我还能享受遗忘。他不行。”她拿起一片羽毛，轻轻蹭着自己的手腕，盯着它，好像在希望它活起来，飞起来。“我不知道这羽毛意味着什么，也不知道它的故事，可我知道它的意思是，他想着我。这么多年来一直想着我。他记得我。”【注：[15]法语：我可以忘掉。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I put an arm around her shoulder as she weeps quietly. I watch the sun-washed trees, the river flowing past us and beneath the bridge -- the Pont Saint-Bénezet -- the bridge the children's song is about. It's a half bridge, really, as only four of its original arches remain. It ends midway across the river. Like it reached, tried to reunite with, the other side and fell short.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她轻声哭了起来，我搂住她的肩膀。我看着沐浴在阳光下的树，河水流过我们身旁，流过这座桥——圣贝内泽桥，儿歌里的桥。它其实是座断桥，原来的桥拱只剩下了四个，走到河中央便戛然而止。仿佛它在努力渡河，让两岸聚首，却功亏一篑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That night at the hotel, I lie awake in bed and watch the clouds nudging against the big swollen moon hanging in our window. Down below, heels click on the cobblestones. Laughter and chatter. Mopeds rattling past. From the restaurant across the street, the clinking of glasses on trays. The tinkling of a piano meanders up through the window and to my ears.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当晚在酒店，我躺在床上，醒着，望着月亮大而圆满，高挂在我们的窗棂中间，由着云朵轻推慢撞。窗外月下，高跟鞋咔嗒咔嗒，敲击着鹅卵石。欢笑，絮语。小摩托车咯噔咯噔驶过。马路对面的餐馆里，杯盘叮当，钢琴叮咚，蜿蜒流转，从窗口攀援而入，轻敲着我的耳鼓。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I turn over and watch Pari sleeping soundlessly beside me. Her face is pale in the light. I see Baba in her face -- youthful, hopeful Baba, happy, how he used to be -- and I know I will always find him whenever I look at Pari. She is my flesh and blood. And soon I will meet her children, and her children's children, and my blood courses through them too. I am not alone. A sudden happiness catches me unawares. I feel it trickling into me, and my eyes go liquid with gratitude and hope.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我翻过身，看着帕丽，她安静地睡在我身边。灯光之下，她的脸显得苍白。我在她脸上看见了巴巴，年轻而满怀希望的巴巴，像过去那样快乐。我知道了，不管什么时候，只要看到帕丽，我也就看得见巴巴。她是我的血与肉。很快我也将见到她的孩子，还有她孩子的孩子们，我的血也在他们周身奔流。我不孤单。一种突然的幸福，出其不意地淹没了我。我感到它在涓涓流入我的身体，也带着感恩和希望，流入了我的双眼。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As I watch Pari sleep, I think of the bedtime game Baba and I used to play. The purging of bad dreams, the gift of happy ones. I remember the dream I used to give him. Careful not to wake Pari, I reach across now and gently rest my palm on her brow. I close my own eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我看着熟睡中的帕丽，想起了巴巴和我常玩的睡前游戏。清除掉一个个噩梦，再以好梦相赠。我想起了我常常送给他的那个梦，于是小心翼翼地伸出手，生怕弄醒帕丽，轻轻盖住了她的额头。我闭上了眼睛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It is a sunlit afternoon. They are children once more, brother and sister, young and clear-eyed and sturdy. They are lying in a patch of tall grass in the shade of an apple tree ablaze with flowers. The grass is warm against their backs and the sun on their faces, flickering through the riot of blossoms above. They rest sleepily, contentedly, side by side, his head resting on the ridge of a thick root, hers cushioned by the coat he has folded for her. Through half-lidded eyes, she watches a blackbird perched on a branch. Streams of cool air blow through the leaves and downward.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是个明媚的午后。他们又一次成了孩童，哥哥和妹妹。小小的年纪，明澈的眼睛，结结实实的身子骨。他们躺在一片高草中，置身于苹果树的树荫下。一树花开，满枝吐焰。他们身下铺着暖草，脸上披着阳光，高高的光影，闪烁在怒放的新花中间。他们躺着，带着睡意，带着满足，紧紧相挨。他枕着粗大而隆起的树根，而她的脑袋下面，垫着他叠起的外衣。透过半开的眼皮，她看见一只乌鸫栖于高枝。凉风习习，吹过树叶中间，又转而下探。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She turns her face to look at him, her big brother, her ally in all things, but his face is too close and she can't see the whole of it. Only the dip of his brow, the rise of his nose, the curve of his eyelashes. But she doesn't mind. She is happy enough to be near him, with him -- her brother -- and as a nap slowly steals her away, she feels herself engulfed in a wave of absolute calm. She shuts her eyes. Drifts off, untroubled, everything clear, and radiant, and all at once.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她扭过脸看着他，看着她的哥哥，她不离不弃的伙伴，可他的脸太近了，她看不到全貌。只有他下落的眼眉，微翘的鼻子，弯弯的睫毛。可她不在乎。待在他身边，和他，和她哥哥在一起，她足以感到幸福。当睡意慢慢把她偷走，她感觉到，一片绝对平静的波浪将她浸没。她闭上眼，漂进了睡乡，没有烦忧，一切都是清澈的，灿烂的，一切都同时来到了。">查看中文翻译</div>
