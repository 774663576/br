<div class="line_en">It happened now and then in the almost forty years they lived in the row of row houses that some thoughtless and recently moved-in neighbor was bold enough to ask Sonja what the real cause was for the deep animosity between Ove and Rune. Why had two men who had once been friends suddenly started hating one another with such overpowering intensity?</div>

<div class="line_en">Sonja usually answered that it was quite straightforward. It was simply about how when the two men and their wives moved into their houses, Ove drove a Saab 96 and Rune a Volvo 244. A year or so later Ove bought a Saab 95 and Rune bought a Volvo 245. Three years later Ove bought a Saab 900 and Rune bought a Volvo 265. In the decades that followed, Ove bought another two Saab 900s and then a Saab 9000. Rune bought another Volvo 265 and then a Volvo 745, but a few years later he went back to a sedan model and acquired a Volvo 740. Whereupon Ove bought yet one more Saab 9000 and Rune eventually went over to a Volvo 760, after which Ove got himself a Saab 9000i and Rune part-exchanged to a Volvo 760 Turbo.</div>

<div class="line_en">And possibly it was not the entire explanation for why these two men loathed one another, Sonja used to explain. Either you understood it or you didn't. And if you didn't understand, there was no point even trying to clarify the rest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这很可能不是两个男人闹翻的全部理由，索雅总这么解释。能理解的人自然理解，不理解的也就没有必要再解释下去了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Most people never did understand, Ove often commented. But then people had no idea of loyalty these days. The car was just "a means of transport" and the road just a complication arising between two points. Ove is convinced this is why the roads are as bad as they are. If people were a little more careful with their cars they wouldn't drive like idiots, he thinks, watching with concern as Parvaneh pushes away the newspaper he has spread across her seat. She has to retract the driver's seat as far as it'll go, so she can maneuver her pregnant belly into the car, then bring it forward all the way so she can reach the wheel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大多数人当然永远不会理解，欧维总是这么认为。反正大家对什么是忠诚也已经一无所知。如今车只不过是一种交通工具，而道路只是两点之间乱七八糟的连接线。欧维窃以为，这就是交通一团糟的原因。要是人们稍微担心一下自己的车，就不会开得跟脑子有病似的了，他眼见帕尔瓦娜把他铺在座位上的报纸推开的时候，心里这么想。她不得不把驾驶座推到最后才把自己怀孕的肚皮挤上车，然后又把座位拉到最前端才够到方向盘。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And then the day came when Ove went to the car dealer to look at the recently launched Saab 9-3, and when he came home in the evening, Rune had bought a BMW.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Because you're getting a proper license!" Ove cuts her short, emphasizing "proper" in a way that makes it plain that a license for an automatic is as much a "proper driver's license" as a car with an automatic gearbox is a "proper car."</div>

<div class="line_en">Parvaneh seems to accept this as an apology. She nods and calms down. Takes hold of the steering wheel, starts the car, and follows his instructions. The Saab lurches forward with a little jump, then pauses before catapulting itself with a loud roar towards the guest parking and very nearly crashing into another car. Ove tugs at the hand brake. Parvaneh lets go of the steering wheel and yells in panic, covering her eyes with her hands until the Saab finally comes to an abrupt stop. Ove is puffing as if he'd had to make his way to the hand brake by forcing himself through a military obstacle course. His facial muscles twitch like a man whose eyes are being sprayed with lemon juice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="帕尔瓦娜显然把这话当成是道歉，于是点点头，振作精神，把住方向盘，发动汽车，照他的话做起来。萨博猛地向前一冲，卡了一下，然后咆哮一声朝访客停车场扎了过去，差那么一毫就径直撞上了另一辆车。欧维拉住手刹，帕尔瓦娜松开方向盘，惊声尖叫着用双手捂住眼睛，直到萨博终于猛烈地晃动着急停下来。欧维大喘粗气，就像拉手刹之前被迫经历了一场军事障碍训练。他的脸抽搐得就像有人往他眼睛里喷了柠檬汁。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The light turns green. Parvaneh brings up the clutch, the Saab splutters, and the instrument panel goes black. Stressed, Parvaneh turns the key in the ignition, which only makes it grind in a heartrending manner. The engine makes a roar, coughs, and dies anew. The men with the shaved heads and tattooed throats sound the horn. One of them gestures.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="绿灯亮起，帕尔瓦娜松开离合器，萨博干咳一声，仪表盘上的一切一齐变暗。帕尔瓦娜紧张地旋转点火的钥匙，它却只发出一阵揪心的震颤。发动机大吼一声，干咳，又灭了。光头文颈男们按按喇叭。其中一个做了个手势。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It takes them fifteen minutes to get out of the parking area and onto the main road. Once they're there, Parvaneh revs the first gear until the Saab vibrates like it's about to explode. Ove tells her to change gear and she replies that she doesn't know how. Meanwhile the cat seems to be trying to open the back door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们花了一刻钟才从停车场开出来上了大路。帕尔瓦娜用一挡在大路上跑得整辆萨博跟要炸了似的。欧维让她换挡，她说不知道该怎么换。此刻猫咪在后座想方设法要打开车门。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When they get to the first red light, a big black SUV with two shaven-headed young men in the front pulls up so close to their rear bumper that Ove is pretty sure he'll have their license number etched into his paintwork when they get home. Parvaneh glances nervously in the mirror. The SUV revs its engine, as if giving vent to some sort of opinion. Ove turns and looks out the back window. The two men have tattoos all over their throats, he notes. As if the SUV is not a clear enough advertisement for their stupidity.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们到达第一个红灯的时候，一辆高大的城市吉普——前座上坐着两个剃着光头的年轻人——停在他们身后，离他们的保险杠非常近，欧维确信回家后都能从车漆上找出车牌号来。帕尔瓦娜紧张地朝后视镜里瞟了一眼。城市吉普轰了轰油门，就像表了个态。欧维转身从后窗望出去。两个男人脖子上布满了文身，就像城市吉普还不够证明他们都长了榆木脑袋。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The SUV behind them honks until it sounds as if the Finland ferry is about to run them down. And then something in Ove snaps. He throws the door open, gets out of the car, walks slowly around the SUV, and rips the driver's door open.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们身后的城市吉普把喇叭摁得就像他们把车停在了一艘芬兰渡轮的引擎盖上。此刻欧维身上起了某种反应，技术上称之为“回火”。他推开车门，下车，大步绕到城市吉普旁边，一把拉开前座车门。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Throat Tattoo doesn't have time to answer and Ove doesn't wait for him either. Instead he grabs the young man by his collar and pulls him up so hard that his body tumbles clumsily out of the car. He's a muscular sort, easily weighing in at two hundred pounds, but Ove holds his collar in an immovable steel grip. Evidently, Throat Tattoo is so surprised by the strength in the old man's grip that it doesn't occur to him to put up any resistance. Fury burns in Ove's eyes as he presses the probably thirty-five-years-younger man so hard against the side of the SUV that the bodywork creaks. He places the tip of his index finger in the middle of the shaved head and positions his eyes so close to Throat Tattoo's face that they feel each other's breath.</div>

No one is making the slightest move to come to his assistance. No one beeps. No one moves. Everyone seems to be thinking the same thing: If a non-throat-tattooed man of Ove's age without any hesitation steps up to a throat-tattooed man of the age of this Throat Tattoo and presses him up against a car in this manner, then it's very likely not the throat-tattooed man one should be most worried about annoying.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ove nods by way of confirmation and lets him back down on the ground. Then turns around, walks around the SUV, and gets back into the Saab. Parvaneh stares at him, with her mouth hanging open.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Now, you listen to me," says Ove calmly while he carefully closes the door.</div>

<div class="line_en">"You've given birth to two children and quite soon you'll be squeezing out a third. You've come here from a land far away and most likely you fled war and persecution and all sorts of other nonsense. You've learned a new language and got yourself an education and you're holding together a family of obvious incompetents. And I'll be damned if I've seen you afraid of a single bloody thing in this world before now."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你有两个孩子，马上第三个就要从你肚子里蹦出来。你来自外国，一定是因为战争、迫害或各种可怕的灾难而背井离乡。你学了一门新的语言，接受教育，支撑着一个显然不怎么好养的家。要是让你再受这世界上哪怕任何一坨屎的惊吓，我就不得好死。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ove rivets his eyes into her. Parvaneh is still agape. Ove points imperiously at the pedals under her feet.</div>

<div class="line_en">And that afternoon Parvaneh learns to drive.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天下午，帕尔瓦娜学会了开车。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm not asking for brain surgery. I'm asking you to drive a car. It's got an accelerator, a brake, and a clutch. Some of the greatest twits in world history have sorted out how it works. And you will as well."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不是请你做脑外科手术，只是请你开车。这是油门、刹车和离合器。这世上有史以来最著名的几个白痴都能搞明白这玩意是怎么工作的，你肯定也行。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Parvaneh pushes a ringlet of hair out of her face, sticky with tears. Clumsily she once again grabs hold of the steering wheel with both hands. Ove nods, puts on his safety belt, and makes himself comfortable.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="帕尔瓦娜捋开脸上被泪水凝结在一起的一撮头发，双手再次笨拙地握住方向盘。欧维点点头，系上安全带，坐直身子。">查看中文翻译</div>
