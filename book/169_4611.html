<div class="line_en">The drums were pounding out a battle beat as the Iron Victory swept forward, her ram cutting through the choppy green waters. The smaller ship ahead was turning, oars slapping at the sea. Roses streamed upon her banners; fore and aft a white rose upon a red escutcheon, atop her mast a golden one on a field as green as grass. The Iron Victory raked her side so hard that half the boarding party lost their feet. Oars snapped and splintered, sweet music to the captain's ears. He vaulted over the gunwale, landing on the deck below with his golden cloak billowing behind him. The white roses drew back, as men always did at the sight of Victarion Greyjoy armed and armored, his face hidden behind his kraken helm. They were clutching swords and spears and axes, but nine of every ten wore no armor, and the tenth had only a shirt of sewn scales. These are no ironmen, Victarion thought. They still fear drowning.</div>

<div class="line_en">From all sides the rosey warriors converged, with grey steel in their hands and terror behind their eyes. Their fear was so ripe Victarion could taste it. Left and right he laid about, hewing off the first man's arm at the elbow, cleaving through the shoulder of the second. The third buried his own axehead in the soft pine of Victarion's shield. He slammed it into the fool's face, knocked him off his feet, and slew him when he tried to rise again. As he was struggling to free his axe from the dead man's rib cage, a spear jabbed him between the shoulder blades. It felt as though someone had slapped him on the back. Victarion spun and slammed his axe down onto the spearman's head, feeling the impact in his arm as the steel went crunching through helm and hair and skull. The man swayed for half a heartbeat, till the iron captain wrenched the steel free and sent his corpse staggering loose-limbed across the deck, looking more drunk than dead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玫瑰战士从四面八方围上来，寒铁在手，但眼神慌张，维克塔利昂品尝得到他们浓烈的恐惧。他左冲右突，砍下第一个人的手臂，劈穿第二个人的肩膀，第三个人将斧子劈进维克塔利昂松软的松木盾里，而他反手将盾牌砸到那笨蛋的脸上，将其撞翻，然后趁其试图站起来时猛下杀招。他正奋力将斧子从死人肋骨间拔出，一支长矛戳进他肩胛骨之间，感觉像被人拍了一下后背。维克塔利昂回身砍向长矛兵的脑袋，钢铁劈开头盔、头发和颅骨，手上一阵酥麻。那人略微摇晃了片刻，等铁船长抽回斧子，尸体便四仰八叉跌倒在甲板上，看上去更像是醉酒，而不是死了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When he turned to find the next victim for his axe, he spied the other captain across the deck. His white surcoat was spotted with blood and gore, but Victarion could make out the arms upon his breast, the white rose within its red escutcheon. The man bore the same device upon his shield, on a white field with a red embattled border. "You!" the iron captain called across the carnage. "You of the rose! Be you the lord of Southshield?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他转身替自己的斧子寻找下一个牺牲品，发现对方船长就在甲板另一边。此人的白色外套沾染着点点血浆，但维克塔利昂能辨认出他胸口的纹章：红盾纹中一朵白玫瑰。那人的盾牌上也有同样的徽纹，镶在红色底子上，四周围着一圈白色城垛。“你！”铁船长在杀戮战场中大喝，“戴玫瑰的！你是南盾岛领主？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">By then his ironborn had followed him down onto the deck of the broken longship. He heard Wulfe One-Ear let out a howl as he went to work, glimpsed Ragnor Pyke in his rusted mail, saw Nute the Barber send a throwing axe spinning through the air to catch a man in the chest. Victarion slew another man, and another. He would have killed a third, but Ragnor cut him down first. "Well struck," Victarion bellowed at him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此时铁民们已随他跳到被攻击的舰艇上。他听见“单耳”沃费发出一声嚎叫，又瞥到拉格诺·派克穿着生锈的甲胄投入战团，而“理发师”纽特扔出旋转的飞斧，击中敌人的胸膛。维克塔利昂又接连杀死两个，他本打算杀第三个，但拉格诺先下手了。“干得好！”维克塔利昂朝他喊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Serry leapt to meet him. His longsword was good castle-forged steel, and the young knight made it sing. His first cut was low, and Victarion deflected it off his axe. His second caught the iron captain on the helm before he got his shield up. Victarion answered with a sidearm blow of his axe. Serry's shield got in the way. Wooden splinters flew, and the white rose split lengthwise with a sweet sharp crack. The young knight's longsword hammered at his thigh, once, twice, thrice, screaming against the steel. This boy is quick, the iron captain realized. He smashed his shield in Serry's face and sent him staggering back against the gunwale. Victarion raised his axe and put all his weight behind his cut, to open the boy from neck to groin, but Serry spun away. The axehead crashed through the rail, sending splinters flying, and lodged there when he tried to pull it free. The deck moved under his feet, and he stumbled to one knee.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="西瑞一跃而起，迎上前来。他的钢剑是城堡中铸就的上等货，而这个年轻骑士将它舞得呼呼生风。他第一击砍向下盘，维克塔利昂用斧子拨开，还不及举盾，又被第二击打中头盔。维克塔利昂的斧子从侧面还击，西瑞以盾牌抵挡，木屑飞散，随着一声动听而尖锐的断裂声，白玫瑰折成上下两半。随即，年轻骑士的剑接二连三敲到他的大腿，在铁甲上发出刺耳声响。这小子动作很快，铁船长意识到，于是他用盾牌撞击西瑞的脸，将其跌跌撞撞地逼至舷缘，随后高举斧头，压上身体的重量，意图将年轻人整个儿劈成两半，却被西瑞一旋身躲开了。斧子猛劈入栏杆，碎片四散，他试图拔出来再劈，不料它被卡住了。甲板在身下摇晃，他一失足，单膝跪倒在地。">查看中文翻译</div>

He caught Serry's blade in an iron fist. Lobstered steel crunched, and a stab of pain made him grunt, yet Victarion held on. "I am quick as well, boy," he said as he ripped the sword from the knight's hand and flung it into the sea.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="塔尔勃特爵士扔掉破碎的盾牌，长剑下砍。维克塔利昂的盾牌在跌倒时扭到了另一边，只得用钢甲铁拳抓向西瑞的剑。铁手套上的关节吱嘎作响，一阵刺痛令他闷哼一声，但维克塔利昂坚持忍住。“我动作也很快，小子。”他边说边把剑从骑士手中夺下，扔进海里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That won him a respite to pull his axe loose. The white roses were falling back before the iron tide. Some tried to flee belowdecks, as others cried for quarter. Victarion could feel warm blood trickling down his fingers beneath the mail and leather and lobstered plate, but that was nothing. Around the mast a thick knot of foemen fought on, standing shoulder to shoulder in a ring. These few are men, at least. They would sooner die than yield. Victarion would grant some of them that wish. He beat his axe against his shield and charged them.</div>

<div class="line_en">They hacked at him from front and back, but their swords might have been willow switches for all the harm they did him. No blade could cut through Victarion Greyjoy's heavy plate, nor did he give his foes the time to find the weak points at the joints, where only mail and leather warded him. Let three men assail him, or four, or five; it made no matter. He slew them one at a time, trusting in his steel to protect him from the others. As each foe fell he turned his wroth upon the next.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们从前后一起袭来，但他们的剑像柳条一样无法对他造成伤害。没有东西能砍穿维克塔利昂·葛雷乔伊厚重的板甲，他也不会给敌人找到关节薄弱点的机会——那里只有锁甲和皮甲的保护。不管攻击他的人是三个、四个还是五个，都没区别，他逐一杀死，心中坚信自己的钢甲能抵御其余攻击。每当一个敌人倒下，他便将怒气转移到下一个敌人身上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The last man to face him must have been a smith; he had shoulders like a bull, and one much more muscular than the other. His armor was a studded brigandine and a cap of boiled leather. The only blow he landed completed the ruin of Victarion's shield, but the cut the captain dealt in answer split his head in two. Would that I could deal with the Crow's Eye as simply. When he jerked his axehead free again, the smith's skull seemed to burst. Bone and blood and brain went everywhere, and the corpse fell forward, up against his legs. Too late to plead for quarter now, Victarion thought as he untangled himself from the dead man. By then the deck was slick beneath his feet, and the dead and the dying lay in heaps on every side. He threw his shield away and sucked in air. "Lord Captain," he heard the Barber say beside him, "the day is ours."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后一个人一定是位铁匠：公牛样的肩膀，其中一边比另一边粗壮得多。那人身穿镶钉锁甲，头戴熟皮帽。他唯一命中的一击使得维克塔利昂的盾牌最终完全损毁，但铁船长回砍一斧，便将他脑袋劈成两半。对付鸦眼要这么简单就好了。他将斧子拔出，铁匠的头颅仿佛爆裂一般，骨头，鲜血和脑浆洒得到处都是，尸体扑倒下来，靠在他腿上。现在求饶太晚了，维克塔利昂边想边甩脱死尸。此时，他脚下的甲板变得滑腻腻的，左右躺满一堆堆死尸和濒死的人。他扔开盾牌，深吸一口气。“司令官，”“理发师”就在他身边，“今天的胜利属于我们。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">All around the sea was full of ships. Some were burning, some were sinking, some had been smashed to splinters. Between the hulls the water was thick as stew, full of corpses, broken oars, and men clinging to the wreckage. In the distance, half a dozen of southron longships were racing back toward the Mander. Let them go, Victarion thought, let them tell the tale. Once a man had turned his tail and run from battle he ceased to be a man.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="海上布满船只，有些在燃烧，有些在下沉，有些被撞得支离破碎。船壳之间的水面犹如一锅炖汤，点缀了无数尸体、断桨和扒在残骸上的人。远处，十几艘属于南方人的长船正疾速逃进曼德河。让他们逃，维克塔利昂心想，让他们去传扬这个故事。夹着尾巴逃跑的不是男人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His eyes were stinging from the sweat that had run down into them during the fight. Two of his oarsmen helped undo his kraken helm so he might lift it off. Victarion mopped at his brow. "That knight," he grumbled, "the knight of the white rose. Did any of you pull him out?" A lord's son would be worth a goodly ransom; from his father, if Lord Serry had survived the day. From his liege at Highgarden, if not.</div>

<div class="line_en">He gave the captured ship to Ragnor Pyke, named a dozen men to crew her, and clambered back up onto his own Iron Victory. "Strip the captives of arms and armor and have their wounds bound up," he told Nute the Barber. "Throw the dying in the sea. If any beg for mercy, cut their throats first." He had only contempt for such; better to drown on seawater than on blood. "I want a count of the ships we won and all the knights and lordlings we took captive. I want their banners too." One day he would hang them in his hall, so when he grew old and feeble he could remember all the foes he had slain when he was young and strong.</div>

<div class="line_en">Aye, he thought, a great victory for the Crow's Eye and his wizards. The other captains would shout his brother's name anew when the tidings reached Oakenshield. Euron had seduced them with his glib tongue and smiling eye and bound them to his cause with the plunder of half a hundred distant lands; gold and silver, ornate armor, curved swords with gilded pommels, daggers of Valyrian steel, striped tiger pelts and the skins of spotted cats, jade manticores and ancient Valyrian sphinxes, chests of nutmeg, cloves, and saffron, ivory tusks and the horns of unicorns, green and orange and yellow feathers from the Summer Sea, bolts of fine silk and shimmering samite… and yet all that was little and less, compared to this. Now he has given them conquest, and they are his for good and all, the captain thought. The taste was bitter on his tongue. This was my victory, not his. Where was he? Back on Oakenshield, lazing in a castle. He stole my wife and he stole my throne, and now he steals my glory.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没错，他心想，对鸦眼和他的巫师们来说是一场大胜仗。等消息传到橡盾岛，其他船长们又会高呼他哥哥的名字。攸伦曾凭借伶牙俐齿和微笑的眼睛魅惑他们，用来自远方的诸多战利品吸引他们为他效力：金、银、釉彩盔甲，镀金圆头的弯刀、瓦雷利亚钢匕首、斑纹虎皮、花斑猫皮、翡翠狮身蝎尾兽、古老的瓦雷利亚斯芬克斯像、豆蔻、丁香、藏红花、象牙、独角兽角、来自盛夏群岛的绿、橙和黄色羽毛，精致的丝绸与闪亮的锦缎…但跟现在比起来，这些都显得微不足道。他让他们去征服，他们便永远成了他的人，船长舌尖苦涩。这是我的胜利，不是他的。他在哪儿？在后方的橡盾岛，在城堡里游手好闲。他偷走我的妻子，偷走我的王座，现在又偷走我的荣耀。">查看中文翻译</div>

Later, when Balon's sons were born, he had grown to accept that one day he would kneel to them as well, when one of them took his father's place upon the Seastone Chair.

<div class="line_en">The wind was freshening, and his thirst was raging. After a battle he always wanted wine. He gave the deck to Nute and went below. In his cramped cabin aft, he found the dusky woman wet and ready; perhaps the battle had warmed her blood as well. He took her twice, in quick succession. When they were done there was blood smeared across her breasts and thighs and belly, but it was his blood, from the gash in his palm. The dusky woman washed it out for him with boiled vinegar.</div>

It was a lazy river, wide and slow and treacherous with snags and sandbars. Most seagoing vessels dared not sail beyond Highgarden, but longships with their shallow draughts could navigate as far upstream as Bitterbridge. In ancient days, the ironborn had boldly sailed the river road and plundered all along the Mander and its vassal streams… until the kings of the green hand had armed the fisherfolk on the four small islands off the Mander's mouth and named them his shields.</div>

<div class="line_en">Two thousand years had passed, but in the watchtowers along their craggy shores, greybeards still kept the ancient vigil. At the first glimpse of longships the old men would light their beacon fires, and the call would leap from hill to hill and island to island. Fear! Foes! Raiders! Raiders! When the fisherfolk saw the fires burning on the high places they would put their nets and plows aside and take up their swords and axes. Their lords would rush from their castles, attended by their knights and men-at-arms. Warhorns would echo across the waters, from Greenshield and Greyshield, Oakenshield and Southshield, and their longships would come sliding out from moss-covered stone pens along the shores, oars flashing as they swarmed across the straits to seal the Mander and hound and harry the raiders upriver to their doom.</div>

<div class="line_en">Euron had sent Torwold Browntooth and the Red Oarsman up the Mander with a dozen swift longships, so the lords of the Shield Islands would spill forth in pursuit. By the time his main fleet arrived, only a handful of fighting men remained to defend the isles themselves. The ironborn had come in on the evening tide, so the glare of the setting sun would keep them hidden from the greybeards in the watchtowers until it was too late. The wind was at their backs, as it had been all the way down from Old Wyk. It was whispered about the fleet that Euron's wizards had much and more to do with that, that the Crow's Eye appeased the Storm God with blood sacrifice. How else would he have dared sail so far to the west, instead of following the shoreline as was the custom?</div>

He had three aboard the Silence, Quellon Humble had confided in a whisper. Queer men and terrible, they were, but the Crow's Eye had made them slaves. "He still needs me to fight his battles, though," Victarion insisted. "Wizards may be well and good, but blood and steel win wars." The vinegar made his wound hurt worse than ever.

"Balon was mad, Aeron is madder, and Euron is maddest of them all." The young lord had tried to sail home after the kingsmoot, refusing to accept Euron as his liege. But the Iron Fleet had closed the bay, the habit of obedience was rooted deep in Victarion Greyjoy, and Euron wore the driftwood crown.

Victarion's hunger flared. "Let him come. I will take his sword for mine own, as your own forebear took Red Rain. Let them all come, and bring the Lannisters as well. A lion may be fierce enough on land, but at sea the kraken rules supreme." He would give half his teeth for the chance to try his axe against the Kingslayer or the Knight of Flowers.

Ironborn filled the tables, drinking and shouting and jostling each other, boasting of the men that they had slain, the deeds that they had done, the prizes they had won. Many were bedecked with plunder. Left-Hand Lucas Codd and Quellon Humble had torn tapestries off the walls to serve as cloaks. Germund Botley wore a rope of pearls and garnets over his gilded Lannister breastplate. Andrik the Unsmiling staggered by with a woman under each arm; though he remained unsmiling, he had rings on every finger.

Darkness gathered beyond the walls, but inside the torches burned with a ruddy orange glow, and their smoke gathered under the rafters like a grey cloud. Drunken men began to dance the finger dance.

Euron stood by the window, drinking from a silver cup. He wore the sable cloak he took from Blacktyde, his red leather eye patch, and nothing else.
