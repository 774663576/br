Well, Judge Young will instruct you that that's not what this trial is about. I'm sure that for every doctor who did not approve of her work, we could produce a dozen doctors who did. But that is not the issue.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was the final day of the trial. Alan Penn, the defense attorney, was making his summation to the jury.</div>

<div class="line_en">He looked into the faces of the jurors. "Euthanasia is a crime of compassion, of mercy, and I daresay it takes place in some form or another in hospitals all over the world. The prosecuting attorney is asking for a death sentence. Don't let him confuse the issue. There has never been a death sentence for euthanasia. Sixty-three percent of Americans believe euthanasia should be legal, and in eighteen states in this country, it is legal. The question is, do we have the right to compel helpless patients to live in pain, to force them to stay alive and suffer? The question has become complicated because of the great strides we've made in medical technology. We've turned the care of patients over to machines. Machines have no mercy. If a horse breaks a leg, we put it out of its misery by shooting it. With a human being, we condemn him or her to a half life that is hell.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他直视着陪审团的每个成员。“无痛苦致死或者叫安乐死，是一种怜悯的罪恶，是一种仁慈的罪恶，而且我敢说，它在全世界的医院里以各种各样的方式发生着。控方律师要求判处死刑。不能让他在此混淆视听。从来没有因安乐死而判死刑的先例。百分之六十五的美国人认为安乐死应属合法，在这个国家里已经有18个州安乐死合法。问题的关键是，我们是否有权强迫那些无可救药的病人在痛苦中生活，强迫他们活活受罪？由于医学技术的大步发展，这个问题变得复杂起来。我们已经把对病人的看护转移给机器来从事。机器是没有任何仁慈怜悯之心的。如果一匹马断了腿，我们就开枪打死它，使它摆脱痛苦。而对一个人，我们却要强使他或她在一种不死不活的地狱般的境地中饱受煎熬。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Paige Taylor is on trial for the death of John Cronin. She has admitted helping him die. She did so because he was in great pain, and he asked her to do so. That is euthanasia, and it's being accepted more and more throughout the world. In the past year, the California Supreme Court has upheld the right of a mentally competent adult to refuse or demand the withdrawal of medical treatment of any form. It is the individual who must live or die with the course of treatment chosen or rejected."</div>

"Ladies and gentlemen, I have been practicing law in courtrooms for more than twenty years, and I must tell you that in all those years.

She has taken full responsibility for that. But you can rest assured that she knew nothing about the money that was left to her. What she did, she did in a spirit of compassion. John Cronin was a man with a failing heart and an untreatable, fatal cancer that had spread through his body, causing him agony. Just ask yourself one question. Under those circumstances, would you like to go on living? Thank you." He turned, walked back to the table, and sat next to Paige.</div>

<div class="line_en">Gus Venable glanced at the defendant again. There was a look of despair on Paige's face. He turned back to the jury. "An attorney has testified that Dr. Taylor said, about the million dollars that was left to her, 'It's unethical. He was my patient.' But she grabbed the money. She needed it. She had a drawer full of travel brochures at home -- Paris, London, the Riviera. And bear in mind that she didn't go to the travel agency after she got the money. Oh, no. She planned those trips earlier. All she needed was the money and the opportunity, and John Cronin supplied both. A helpless, dying man she could control. She had at her mercy a man who she admitted was in enormous pain -- agony, in fact, according to her own admission. When you're in that kind of pain, you can imagine how difficult it must be to think clearly. We don't know how Dr. Taylor persuaded John Cronin to change his will, to cut out the family he loved and to make her his main beneficiary. What we do know is that he summoned her to his bedside on that fatal night. What did they talk about? Could he have offered her a million dollars to put him out of his misery? It's a possibility we must face. In either case, it was cold-blooded murder.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="格斯·维纳布朝被告瞥了一眼。佩姬满脸绝望的神情。他又转脸面对陪审团。“一位律师作证，泰勒医生曾就遗赠给她的百万美金说过，‘这是不道德的。他是我的病人。’但她还是霸占了这笔钱。她需要这笔钱。她家里有个抽屉，里面满是旅游观光的小册子——巴黎、伦敦、里维埃拉。请各位注意，她在弄到这笔钱之后，并没有去旅行社。噢，不。她早就计划好了这些旅行。她所欠缺的只是钞票和机会，而现在约翰·克洛宁提供了这两者。他是她可以控制的孤苦无助行将就木的人。她玩弄于股掌之中的这个人，诚如她自己承认的，正处于极大的痛苦之中——一种垂死挣扎苟延残喘的苦难。当你处在这种痛苦中的时候，你可以想象得到，要想头脑清楚地思考会有多大的困难。我们并不知道泰勒医生是怎样劝说约翰·克洛宁修改遗嘱，中止他所热爱的家庭的继承权，而使她自己成为主要受益人的。不过我们确实知道的是，他在那个不幸的夜晚把她叫到床边。他们谈了些什么？他会为了从痛苦中解脱出来而送给她一百万美金吗？这是我们必须面对的可能性。在无论哪种情况下，这都是残酷的谋杀。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's a most remarkable coincidence that immediately after Mr. Cronin changed his will and left Dr. Taylor the sum of one million dollars, she gave him an overdose of insulin and murdered him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“最令人惊异的巧合是，就在克洛宁先生刚刚修改遗嘱和给泰勒医生留下百万美元巨款之后，她立即给他注射过量的胰岛素，将他谋杀。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Again and again, the defendant has convicted herself with her own words. She said that she was on friendly terms with John Cronin, that he liked and respected her. But you have heard witnesses testify that he hated Dr. Paige Taylor, that he called her 'that bitch,' and told her to keep her fucking hands off him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“一遍又一遍，就连被告自己的话也在证明她有罪。她说她与约翰·克洛宁友善相处，他喜欢她并且尊重她。可是你们已经听到证人作证时说他恨佩姬·泰勒医生，他管她叫‘那条母狗’，叫她那双脏手别碰他。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The defense talked about euthanasia. Did Dr. Taylor do what she did out of a feeling of compassion? I don't think so. Dr. Taylor and others have testified that Mr. Cronin had only a few more days to live. Why didn't she let him live those few days? Perhaps it was because Dr. Taylor was afraid Mrs. Cronin might learn about her husband changing his will, and put a stop to it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“辩方刚才谈到安乐死。泰勒医生难道真是出自怜悯之心才干下这桩事的吗？我以为并非如此。泰勒医生本人和其他人都已作证，克洛宁先生已然是去日无多。为什么她就不能让他活过这几天呢？也许是因为泰勒医生害怕克洛宁太太得知她丈夫修改遗嘱的事并且给予阻止吧。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Just a minute!" Venable was beginning to panic. "Isn't it true that you criticized Dr. Taylor's ability so severely that she was finally ready to quit Embarcadero Hospital?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“等一下！”维纳布开始觉得惊慌失措。“你曾经严厉地批评泰勒医生的无能，以致于她最终准备离开恩巴卡德罗医院，这难道不是事实吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Gus Venable turned pale. "Dr. Barker…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="格斯·维纳布的面孔刷地一下子变得惨白。“巴克大夫…”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Lawrence Barker took a deep breath, and when he spoke, his voice was filled with outrage. "Then how the hell could you bring Dr. Taylor to trial?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="劳伦斯·巴克深深吸口气，开始讲话，口气中充满极度的义愤。“那你到底是怎样把泰勒大夫搅到这场官司里来的？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="维纳布以为自己听错了。“对不起，你说什么？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Because it happens to be the truth." Barker turned to look at Paige, and when he spoke again, he was talking to her as though they were the only two people in the courtroom: "Some people are born to be doctors. You were one of those rare ones. I knew from the beginning how capable you were. I was hard on you -- maybe too hard -- because you were good. I was tough on you because I wanted you to be tougher on yourself. I wanted you to be perfect, because in our profession, there's no room for error. None."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“因为这恰巧就是事实。”巴克大夫转过身看着佩姬。当他再度开口说话时，他只对着佩姬侃侃而谈，就像这法庭里只有他们两个人一样。“有些人天生就是医生。你就是这极少数人中的一个。我打从一开始就知道你有多大的能力。我对你非常严格——也许过份严格——因为你非常优秀。我对你毫不客气，因为我要求你自己更为坚强。我期望你成为完美无缺的人，因为在我们这个专业里是容不得一点过失的。一点也不行。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Gus Venable was starting to feel better. "Well, then," he said patronizingly, "how can you say that Paige Taylor is a brilliant doctor?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="格斯·维纳布开始觉得形势有所好转。“好的，那么，”他又摆出屈尊俯就的样子说，“你现在又如何能说佩姬·泰勒是个才华横溢技术高超的医生呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"This trial is a farce!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这场审判是一出大闹剧！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Don't interrupt me," Barker snapped. "You've used the testimony of a lot of biased, jealous people to attack a brilliant surgeon. She --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不要打断我，”巴克抢白道。“你利用一大伙心怀偏见，忌贤妒能的人所作证词来攻击一位才华横溢技术高超的外科大夫。她——”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“是的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Gus Venable could feel his victory slipping away. His prize witness had become his worst nightmare. "Dr. Barker -- it has been testified that you accused Dr. Taylor of killing your patient Lance Kelly. How…?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="格斯·维纳布感觉得出来他的胜利即将成为泡影。他的王牌证人已经成为他最可怕的梦魇。“巴克大夫——有人作证说你曾指责泰勒大夫杀死了你的病人兰斯·凯利。怎么…？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dr. Barker went on speaking slowly, with an effort. "And as for John Cronin leaving her that money, Dr. Taylor knew nothing about it. I talked to Mr. Cronin myself. He told me that he was going to leave Dr. Taylor that money because he hated his family, and he said he was going to ask Dr. Taylor to release him from his misery. I agreed."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="巴克大夫有点费劲地继续慢慢说着。“至于约翰·克洛宁留赠给她一笔钱的事，泰勒大夫事前一无所知。我自己和克洛宁先生谈的。他告诉我，他将把那笔钱留给泰勒大夫，因为他恨他的家产，他并且说他将要求泰勒大夫为他解除痛苦。我同意了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
