<div class="line_en">As he strode across the strand, a drowned man returning from a call of nature stumbled into him in the darkness. "Damphair," he murmured. Aeron laid a hand upon his head, blessed him, and moved on. The ground rose beneath his feet, gently at first, then more steeply. When he felt scrub grass between his toes, he knew that he had left the strand behind. Slowly he climbed, listening to the waves. The sea is never weary. I must be as tireless.</div>

<div class="line_en">He had run before the Crow's Eye as if he were still the weak thing he had been, but when the waves broke over his head they reminded once more that that man was dead. I was reborn from the sea, a harder man and stronger. No mortal man could frighten him, no more than the darkness could, nor the bones of his soul, the grey and grisly bones of his soul. The sound of a door opening, the scream of a rusted iron hinge. The priest's robes crackled as he pulled them down, still stiff with salt from their last washing a fortnight past. The wool clung to his wet chest, drinking the brine that ran down from his hair. He filled his waterskin and slung it over his shoulder.</div>

<div class="line_en">On the crown of the hill four-and-forty monstrous stone ribs rose from the earth like the trunks of great pale trees. The sight made Aeron's heart beat faster. Nagga had been the first sea dragon, the mightiest ever to rise from the waves. She fed on krakens and leviathans and drowned whole islands in her wrath, yet the Grey King had slain her and the Drowned God had changed her bones to stone so that men might never cease to wonder at the courage of the first of kings. Nagga's ribs became the beams and pillars of his longhall, just as her jaws became his throne. For a thousand years and seven he reigned here, Aeron recalled. Here he took his mermaid wife and planned his wars against the Storm God. From here he ruled both stone and salt, wearing robes of woven seaweed and a tall pale crown made from Nagga's teeth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山上，四十四根巨石肋骨从地底冒出来，仿佛巨大的白色树干。看到它们，伊伦不禁心跳加速。娜伽是世上头一条海龙，是大海之中诞生的最具威能的生物，它以海怪和海兽为食，愤怒时能吞下整座岛屿，然而灰海王亲手杀了它，淹神则将它的骨头变成化石，好让后世铁民永远铭记初代先王的功业。娜伽的肋骨成了灰海王大厅的房梁和柱子，它的嘴巴则被当做他的王座。他在这里统治了一千零七年，伊伦回忆道，他娶美人鱼为妻，与风暴之神作战。他不仅统治了海洋，还统治了岩石陆地。他穿着海草编织的长袍，而娜伽的牙齿是他高耸的苍白王冠。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But that was in the dawn of days, when mighty men still dwelt on earth and sea. The hall had been warmed by Nagga's living fire, which the Grey King had made his thrall. On its walls hung tapestries woven from silver seaweed most pleasing to the eyes. The Grey King's warriors had feasted on the bounty of the sea at a table in the shape of a great starfish, whilst seated upon thrones carved from mother-of-pearl. Gone, all the glory gone. Men were smaller now. Their lives had grown short. The Storm God drowned Nagga's fire after the Grey King's death, the chairs and tapestries had been stolen, the roof and walls had rotted away. Even the Grey King's great throne of fangs had been swallowed by the sea. Only Nagga's bones endured to remind the ironborn of all the wonder that had been.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可惜这已是黎明之纪元的往事，当时的勇士们纵横四海，无可阻挡。灰海王留住了娜伽的火种，他的厅堂也因而永远保持着温暖。厅堂的墙壁挂满银色海草编织的织锦，战士们围聚在海星形状的硕大桌旁享用大海的馈赠，他们的座椅则是用珍珠母砌成。消逝了，荣耀的岁月已经消逝。现在的铁民多么渺小，生命也变得短暂，灰海王死后，风暴之神迫不及待地熄灭了娜伽的火种，奸人们偷去座椅和织锦，房顶和墙壁则逐渐腐朽，只剩下娜伽的骨骼，永世地纪念铁种过往的荣耀。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dark clouds ran before the wind as the first light stole into the world. The black sky went grey as slate; the black sea turned grey-green; the black mountains of Great Wyk across the bay put on the blue-green hues of soldier pines. As color stole back into the world, a hundred banners lifted and began to flap. Aeron beheld the silver fish of Botley, the bloody moon of Wynch, the dark green trees of Orkwood. He saw warhorns and leviathans and scythes, and everywhere the krakens great and golden. Beneath them, thralls and salt wives begin to move about, stirring coals into new life and gutting fish for the captains and the kings to break their fasts. The dawnlight touched the stony strand, and he watched men wake from sleep, throwing aside their sealskin blankets as they called for their first horn of ale. Drink deep, he thought, for we have god's work to do today.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="清风吹散黑云，曙光偷偷照亮世界。黑暗的天空变为板岩的灰白，黑暗的大海化作苔藓的灰绿，而海湾对面大威克岛的黑暗山峦被无数士卒松染成蓝绿色。世界有了色泽，一百面不同的旗帜也开始舒展，伊伦看见波特利的银鱼、温奇的血月和奥克伍的深绿树林；他也看见战号、海兽与镰刀，但满山遍野、最为耀眼的还是金色的大海怪。奴工和盐妾们开始活动了，他们重新燃起炭盆，清洗鱼肉，为船长和头领们准备早饭。等曙光照到石滩上时，铁民们也尽皆苏醒过来，掀开海豹皮毯子，叫嚣着索要今天的第一角杯麦酒。喝个痛快吧，伊伦心想，今天，我们要实践神灵的诺言。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Nine wide steps had been hewn from the stony hilltop. Behind rose the howling hills of Old Wyk, with mountains in the distance black and cruel. Aeron paused where the doors once stood, pulled the cork from his waterskin, took a swallow of salt water, and turned to face the sea. We were born from the sea, and to the sea we must return. Even here he could hear the ceaseless rumble of the waves and feel the power of the god who lurked below the waters. Aeron went to his knees. You have sent your people to me, he prayed. They have left their halls and hovels, their castles and their keeps, and come here to Nagga's bones, from every fishing village and every hidden vale. Now grant to them the wisdom to know the true king when he stands before them, and the strength to shun the false. All night he prayed, for when the god was in him Aeron Greyjoy had no need of sleep, no more than the waves did, nor the fishes of the sea.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="九级宽阔的阶梯通向石山顶端，石山背后为老威克岛的呼啸丘陵，更远处则是残酷的漆黑群山。伊伦在门扉曾经矗立之处停顿良久，拔出水袋的木塞，灌了一口盐水，然后转身面朝大海。我们来自大海，终将回归于大海。即便在这里，他仍能清晰地听见浪涛不倦的隆隆拍打声，仍能清楚地体会到海底神灵的力量。于是伊伦不由自主地双膝下跪。伟大的神灵啊，您把您的子民派到我这里，他祈祷，您让他们离开厅堂和茅屋，离开城堡和要塞，来到娜伽的遗骨所在，每个渔村每座山谷的代表齐聚一堂。请您再赐予他们智慧，好让他们选出真正的王者；请您再赐予他们力量，好让他们击退虚伪的僭主。他就这样祈祷了一整夜，和神灵同在，伊伦·葛雷乔伊无须睡眠，正如那浪涛，正如海洋中繁衍的鱼群。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The drowned men took up their driftwood cudgels and began to beat them one against the other as they walked back down the hill. Others joined them, and the clangor spread along the strand. Such a fearful clacking and a clattering it made, as if a hundred trees were pummeling one another with their limbs. Kettledrums began to beat as well, boom-boom-boom-boom-boom, boom-boom-boom-boom-boom. A warhorn bellowed, then another. AAAAAAoooooooooooooooooooooooo.</div>

<div class="line_en">When the Damphair raised his bony hands the kettledrums and the warhorns fell silent, the drowned men lowered their cudgels, and all the voices stilled. Only the sound of the waves pounding remained, a roar no man could still. "We were born from the sea, and to the sea we all return," Aeron began, softly at first, so men would strain to hear. "The Storm God in his wrath plucked Balon from his castle and cast him down, yet now he feasts beneath the waves in the Drowned God's watery halls." He lifted his eyes to the sky. "Balon is dead! The iron king is dead!"</div>

<div class="line_en">Men left their fires to make their way toward the bones of the Grey King's Hall; oarsmen, steersmen, sailmakers, shipwrights, the warriors with their axes and the fishermen with their nets. Some had thralls to serve them; some had salt wives. Others, who had sailed too often to the green lands, were attended by maesters and singers and knights. The common men crowded together in a crescent around the base of the knoll, with the thralls, children, and women toward the rear. The captains and the kings made their way up the slopes. Aeron Damphair saw cheerful Sigfry Stonetree, Andrik the Unsmiling, the knight Ser Harras Harlaw. Lord Baelor Blacktyde in his sable cloak stood beside The Stonehouse in ragged sealskin. Victarion loomed above all of them save Andrik. His brother wore no helm, but elsewise he was all in armor, his kraken cloak hanging golden from his shoulders. He shall be our king.

<div class="line_en">His eyes, Aeron saw, were now grey, now blue, as changeable as the seas. Mad eyes, he thought, fool's eyes. The vision he spoke of was doubtless a snare set by the Storm God to lure the ironborn to destruction. The offerings that his men spilled out before the kingsmoot included sealskins and walrus tusks, arm rings made of whalebone, warhorns banded in bronze. The captains looked and turned away, leaving lesser men to help themselves to the gifts. When the fool was done talking and his champions began to shout his name, only the Farwynds took up the cry, and not even all of them. Soon enough the cries of "Gylbert!

His own hair was snow white as well, and his huge beard covered him like a blanket from cheeks to thighs, so it was hard to tell where the beard ended and the pelt began. Though his grandsons were great strapping men, they struggled with his weight on the steep stone steps. Before the Grey King's Hall they set him down, and three remained below him as his champions.</div>

"I can't count how many hands I've smashed to pulp with that hammer," Erik said, "but might be some thief could tell you. I can't say how many heads I've crushed against my anvil neither, but there's some widows could.
