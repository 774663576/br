<div class="line_en">According to Miss Stephanie Crawford, however, Atticus was leaving the post office when Mr. Ewell approached him, cursed him, spat on him, and threatened to kill him. Miss Stephanie (who, by the time she had told it twice was there and had seen it all -- passing by from the Jitney Jungle, she was)-- Miss Stephanie said Atticus didn't bat an eye, just took out his handkerchief and wiped his face and stood there and let Mr. Ewell call him names wild horses could not bring her to repeat. Mr. Ewell was a veteran of an obscure war; that plus Atticus's peaceful reaction probably prompted him to inquire, "Too proud to fight, you nigger-lovin' bastard?" Miss Stephanie said Atticus said, "No, too old," put his hands in his pockets and strolled on. Miss Stephanie said you had to hand it to Atticus Finch, he could be right dry sometimes.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="但是，看见我们没精打采地在附近闲逛，既不想吃，也不热衷于我们的正常爱好，他知道我们惊恐到什么程度了。一天晚上，他给杰姆看一本新到的橄榄球杂志，想激起他的兴致。看见杰姆胡乱翻了几页就丢到一边时，他问道，“你怎么啦，孩子？”">查看中文翻译</div>

Jem said it might work if I cried and flung a fit, being young and a girl. That didn't work either.</div>

<div class="line_en">"He meant it when he said it," said Atticus. "Jem, see if you can stand in Bob Ewell's shoes a minute. I destroyed his last shred of credibility at that trial, if he had any to begin with. The man had to have some kind of comeback, his kind always does. So if spitting in my face and threatening me saved Mayella Ewell one extra beating, that's something I'll gladly take.

Atticus assured us that nothing would happen to Tom Robinson until the higher court reviewed his case, and that Tom had a good chance of going free, or at least of having a new trial. He was at Enfield Prison Farm, seventy miles away in Chester County. I asked Atticus if Tom's wife and children were allowed to visit him, but Atticus said no.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你讲话要注意语法。”阿迪克斯说，“问题是，汤姆·鲁宾逊是个黑人。在世界上我们的这块地方，没有哪个陪审团会说：‘我们认为你有罪，但是罪不重。’这个案子只有两种结果，要么就干脆释放，要么就是死刑。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Atticus dropped his newspaper beside his chair. He said he didn't have any quarrel with the rape statute, none what ever, but he did have deep misgivings when the state asked for and the jury gave a death penalty on purely circumstantial evidence. He glanced at me, saw I was listening, and made it easier. "-- I mean, before a man is sentenced to death for murder, say, there should be one or two eye-witnesses. Some one should be able to say, 'Yes, I was there and saw him pull the trigger.'"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿迪克斯手中的报纸掉在椅子边。他说他对于有关强奸的法律条款毫无意见。但是，起诉一方只根据问接证据就请求对被告处以极刑，而陪审团也以此为依据定极刑，对于这一点，他感到深为不安。他瞥了我一眼，看见我也在听，就把话说得浅显一点：“我是说，要是一个人因谋杀而判死刑，必须有一两个目击者。必须有人证明说：‘是的，我当时在场，亲眼看见他扣动扳机。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"If you had been on that jury, son, and eleven other boys like you, Tom would be a free man," said Atticus. "So far nothing in your life has interfered with your reasoning process. Those are twelve reasonable men in everyday life, Tom's jury, but you saw something come between them and reason. You saw the same thing that night in front of the jail. When that crew went away, they didn't go as reasonable men, they went because we were there. There's something in our world that makes men lose their heads -- they couldn't be fair if they tried. In our courts, when it's a white man's word against a black man's, the white man always wins. They're ugly, but those are the facts of life."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“假若陪审团是由你和十一个象你这样的娃娃组成，汤姆就自由了。”阿迪克斯说，“到现在为止，在你的生活中，还没有什么来干扰你的推理。组成汤姆案件的陪审团的十二个陪审员在日常生活中足懂道理的人，但是在法庭上你看得出他们和道理之间存在一种什么东西。那天晚上在监狱门前，你看到了类似的情况。那帮人走时，不是因为他们讲道理，而是因为我们在那儿。在这个世界上，有一种东西可以使人丧失理智——即使他想公正也办不到。在我们的法庭上，如果是自人跟黑人打官司，自人毫无疑问会赢。这种现象是丑恶的，但是这是生活中的事实。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Don't fool yourselves -- it's all adding up and one of these days we're going to pay the bill for it. I hope it's not in you children's time."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿迪克斯说这些话时声音一直很柔和，但他说的最后一个词听起来最响。我抬头看他，发现他脸上表露出强烈的感情。“最令我厌恶韵事情莫过于一个下贱的白人利用黑人的无知欺侮他们。不要自欺欺人了，所有的事情会累积起来，有朝一日，我们会要付这笔帐的。我希望不会在你们这一代找你们算帐。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well then, how do you explain why the Cunninghams are different? Mr. Walter can hardly sign his name, I've seen him. We've just been readin' and writin' longer'n they have."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那么，你怎么解释坎宁安家与我们家的不同昵？我曾经看见，沃尔特先生几乎连自己的姓名部不会写。我们只不过比他们读书写字的时间长一些罢了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well I'm glad he could, or who'da taught Atticus and them, and if Atticus couldn't read, you and me'd be in a fix. I don't think that's what background is, Jem."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“暖，幸好那时侯有个人是这样做了，不然谁能教阿迪克斯和芬奇家其他的人呢？要是阿迪克斯不识字，你我两个就真糟了。不过，我想，门第不是指的这个，杰姆。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, everybody's gotta learn, nobody's born knowin'. That Walter's as smart as he can be, he just gets held back sometimes because he has to stay out and help his daddy. Nothin's wrong with him. Naw, Jem, I think there's just one kind of folks. Folks."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，每个人都要学了才会，没有人生来就会。沃尔特非常聪明，但他的聪明有时不能发挥，因为他经常要在家帮他爸爸干活。他没有什么不好。不，杰姆，我认为，人只有一种。就是人。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Background doesn't mean Old Family," said Jem. "I think it's how long your family's been readin' and writin'. Scout, I've studied this real hard and that's the only reason I can think of. Somewhere along when the Finches were in Egypt one of 'em must have learned a hieroglyphic or two and he taught his boy." Jem laughed. "Imagine Aunty being proud her great-grandaddy could read an' write -- ladies pick funny things to be proud of."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“门第并不等于古老的家族啊。”杰姆说，“我想，门第指的是你这个家族会念书会写字共有多久了。斯各特，这个问题我冥思苦想了好大一阵子．这是我想刭的唯一原因。芬奇这一家族在埃及时，家里的某个成员肯定学会了一两个象形文字，并教给了他的小孩。”杰姆笑了起来。“想一想吧，姑妈为她的曾祖父能读能写而感到自豪——女人们总是挑一些奇怪的事情来引以自豪。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"That's what I thought, too," he said at last, "when I was your age. If there's just one kind of folks, why can't they get along with each other? If they're all alike, why do they go out of their way to despise each other? Scout, I think I'm beginning to understand something. I think I'm beginning to understand why Boo Radley's stayed shut up in the house all this time… it's because he wants to stay inside."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我象你这么大时，”他最后说，“也是这样想的。如果人只有一种，为什么人与人之间不能很好地相魁呢？如果大家都一样，为什么他们要专门互相鄙视呢？斯各特，我想，我逐渐悟出了一个道理。我逐渐懂得了为什么布？拉德利总是把自己关在屋子里……那是因为他亭硌呆在屋子里。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jem turned around and punched his pillow. When he settled back his face was cloudy. He was going into one of his declines, and I grew wary. His brows came together; his mouth became a thin line. He was silent for a while.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰姆转身捅了捅枕头。再靠下去时，他脸色显得有些阴沉。他的情绪又在低落下去，弄得我小心谨慎起来。他的眉毛皱成一团，嘴巴变成了一条细缝。好大一会儿他都沉默营。">查看中文翻译</div>
