<div class="line_en">At length they stirred and looked up, and began to search for anything that would give them tidings of Balin's fate, or show what had become of his folk. There was another smaller door on the other side of the chamber, under the shaft. By both the doors they could now see that many bones were lying, and among them were broken swords and axe-heads, and cloven shields and helms. Some of the swords were crooked: orc-scimitars with blackened blades.</div>

<div class="line_en">There were many recesses cut in the rock of the walls, and in them were large iron-bound chests of wood. All had been broken and plundered; but beside the shattered lid of one there lay the remains of a book. It had been slashed and stabbed and partly burned, and it was so stained with black and other dark marks like old blood that little of it could be read. Gandalf lifted it carefully, but the leaves crackled and broke as he laid it on the slab. He pored over it for some time without speaking. Frodo and Gimli standing at his side could see, as he gingerly turned the leaves, that they were written by many different hands, in runes, both of Moria and of Dale, and here and there in Elvish script.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="岩壁上有许多置放箱子的空间，其中有许多外面包覆着铁片的大木箱，每个箱子都已经被撬开、洗劫一空。不过，在其中一个破烂的箱子旁边，留有一本书籍的碎片。那本书经过刀剑之类利器的破坏，有部分甚至被烧毁了，其他的地方还沾有黑色的陈年血迹，因此能够阅读的部分实在少得可怜。甘道夫小心地准备拿起这本书，但书页在他一碰之下瞬间粉碎。他小心阅了一阵子，一言不发。佛罗多和金雳站在他身边，看着他轻手轻脚地翻阅这本由许多人所撰写的册子，其中包含了摩瑞亚和谷地的符文，偶尔还夹杂着精灵文字。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Company of the Ring stood silent beside the tomb of Balin. Frodo thought of Bilbo and his long friendship with the dwarf, and of Balin's visit to the Shire long ago. In that dusty chamber in the mountains it seemed a thousand years ago and on the other side of the world.</div>

<div class="line_en">At last Gandalf looked up. "It seems to be a record of the fortunes of Balin's folk," he said. "I guess that it began with their coming to Dimrill Dale nigh on thirty years ago: the pages seem to have numbers referring to the years after their arrival. The top page is marked one -- three, so at least two are missing from the beginning. Listen to this!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，甘道夫终于抬起头。“看来这是本记录巴林的特遣队遭遇的册子，”他说：“我猜里面的内容，是从他们三十年前从丁瑞尔河谷来到这里开始记载起的。封面第一页写着一之三，很明显，前面的一之一和一之二都已经弄丢了。你们听听其中的内容！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We drove out orcs from the great gate and guard -- I think; the next word is blurred and burned; probably room -- we slew many in the bright -- I think -- sun in the dale. Floi was killed by an arrow. He slew the great. Then there is a blur followed by Floi under grass near Mirror mere. The next line or two I cannot read. Then comes We have taken the twentyfirst hall of North end to dwell in. There is I cannot read what. A shaft is mentioned. Then Balin has set up his seat in the Chamber of Mazarbul."</div>

<div class="line_en">Gandalf paused and set a few leaves aside. "There are several pages of the same sort, rather hastily written and much damaged, he said; "but I can make little of them in this light. Now there must be a number of leaves missing, because they begin to be numbered five, the fifth year of the colony, I suppose. Let me see! No, they are too cut and stained; I cannot read them. We might do better in the sunlight. Wait! Here is something: a large bold hand using an Elvish script."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="甘道夫停了下来，移走几页。“接下来有好几页都是一样的东西，写得很仓促，大部分都无法辨识，”他说：“我在这种微弱的光线下很难看清楚。接下来一定有很多页不见了，因为下面的文章开始以五来标示，我猜是殖民的第年。来，让我看看！要命，这里也被割破、沾上了血迹，我没办法分辨其中的文字。如果有陽光就好了。等等！接下来有新的东西了，这是个笔力苍劲的人用精灵文字记载事情。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I fear he had ill tidings to record in a fair hand," said Gandalf. "The first clear word is sorrow, but the rest of the line is lost, unless it ends in estre. Yes, it must be yestre followed by day being the tenth of novembre Balin lord of Moria fell in Dimrill Dale. He went alone to look in Mirror mere. an orc shot him from behind a stone. we slew the orc, hut many more… up from east up the Silverlode. The remainder of the page is so blurred that I can hardly make anything out, but I think I can read we have barred the gates, and then can hold them long if, and then perhaps horrible and suffer. Poor Balin! He seems to have kept the title that he took for less than five years. I wonder what happened afterwards; but there is no time to puzzle out the last few pages. Here is the last page of all." He paused and sighed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“恐怕这手好字记载的不是什么好事情，甘道夫说：“我能够看懂的第一个字是哀伤，但那一行之后的文字都模糊掉了，最后好像是昨……。没错，那应该是昨天。后面则写着十一月十号，摩瑞亚之王巴林战死在丁瑞尔河谷。他孤身前往调查镜影湖，有名半兽人躲在石头后面偷袭他，将他射死。我们杀死了那半兽人，但有更多……从东边的银光河过来的。接下来的文字完全不清楚，我想我应该知道这边写的是我们堵住了大门，然后可以抵挡他们一阵子，只是这边好像接的是恐怖和痛苦。可怜的巴林！这个称号他只拥有了不到五年。不知道后来到底发生了什么事情；我们现在没时间搞清楚最后几页的迷团是什么，这是最后一页。”他叹了口气。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It is grim reading," he said. "I fear their end was cruel. Listen! We cannot get out. We cannot get out. They have taken the Bridge and second hall. Frar and Loni and Nali fell there. Then there are four lines smeared so that I can only read went 5 days ago. The last lines run the pool is up to the wall at Westgate. The Watcher in the Water took Óin. We cannot get out. The end comes, and then drums, drums in the deep. I wonder what that means. The last thing written is in a trailing scrawl of elf-letters: they are coming. There is nothing more." Gandalf paused and stood in silent thought.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“里面的内容让人不寒而栗，”他说：“他们的结局应该很恐怖，你们听！我们出不去！我们出不去！他们占领了桥梁和第二个大厅。法拉和朗尼和那里死在那边。然后有四行的字模糊不清，我只看得懂，五天前离开……最后一行描述的是湖水已经涨满，快要淹没西门了。水中的监视者抓走了欧寅，我们出不去。末日即将降临，然后是鼓声，地深中传来的鼓声，不知道这是什么意思。最后一行写的是非常潦草的精灵文字：他们来了，然后就没有了。”甘道夫停了下来，沉思着这一切的意义。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A sudden dread and a horror of the chamber fell on the Company. "We cannot get out," muttered Gimli. "It was well for us that the pool had sunk a little, and that the Watcher was sleeping down at the southern end."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="众人觉得自己被笼罩在极端恐怖的气氛中，“我们出不去，”金雳嘀咕着：“幸好湖水已经退了一些，而监视者在南边尽头沉眠……”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Gandalf raised his head and looked round. "They seem to have made a last stand by both doors," he said; "but there were not many left by that time. So ended the attempt to retake Moria! It was valiant but foolish. The time is not come yet. Now, I fear, we must say farewell to Balin son of Fundin. Here he must lie in the halls of his fathers. We will take this book, the Book of Mazarbul, and look at it more closely later. You had better keep it, Gimli, and take it back to Dain, if you get a chance. It will interest him, though it will grieve him deeply. Come, let us go! The morning is passing."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="甘道夫抬起头，看着四周。“他们似乎在两座门之间死守，”他说：“但到了最后也没有剩下多少人。原来重新殖民摩瑞亚的行动是这么结束的！很勇敢，但也很愚蠢。时机还没到，恐怕我们必须向方登之子巴林告别了，他必须和他的先祖们一起安眠。我们先拿走这本撰史之书，稍后有机会再来仔细研读。金雳，这最好交给你来保管，如果有机会的话，将它带给丹恩，虽然里面都是坏消息，但他还是会很感兴趣的。来吧，出发了！时间快来不及了！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Gandalf had hardly spoken these words, when there came a great noise: a rolling Boom that seemed to come from depths far below, and to tremble in the stone at their feet. They sprang towards the door in alarm. Doom, doom it rolled again, as if huge hands were turning the very caverns of Moria into a vast drum. Then there came an echoing blast: a great horn was blown in the hall, and answering horns and harsh cries were heard further off. There was a hurrying sound of many feet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="甘道夫话还没说完，一个巨大的声响突然出现，似乎从地底深处传来的轰，让他们脚底的地板也为之撼动。众人立刻冲向大门。咚！咚！那声音又继续开始隆隆作响，彷佛有只巨手将摩瑞亚当成一面战鼓。然后又传来了另一声刺耳的声音，大厅中出现不停回汤的号角声。然后，远方又传来其他的号角声和叫喊声，接着是许多匆忙的脚步声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Back to the hall," answered Gandalf. "But our visit to this room has not been in vain. I now know where we are. This must be, as Gimli says, the Chamber of Mazarbul; and the hall must be the twenty-first of the North-end. Therefore we should leave by the eastern arch of the hall, and bear right and south, and go downwards. The Twenty-first Hall should be on the Seventh Level, that is six above the level of the Gates. Come now! Back to the hall! "</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“回到大厅里面，”甘道夫回答：“不过，我们这次的探索并不算无功而返。我知道我们的位置了。这里正如同金雳所说的一样，必定是马萨布尔之厅，因此，我们之前所待的大厅必定是北端的第二十一大厅。所以，我们应该从东边的拱门离开，继续往右、往南走，方向则是朝下。第二十一大厅应该在七楼，也就是距离大门六层楼的地方。来吧！回到之前的大厅去！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="甘道夫飞快地站到门缝前，将手杖伸了出去。一瞬间，一道刺眼的亮光照亮了室内和外面的走道。巫师探头出去想要看清楚状况。一阵箭雨从走廊上呼啸而下，甘道夫连忙跳了回来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"There is no sound outside here yet," said Aragorn, who was standing by the eastern door listening. "The passage on this side plunges straight down a stair: it plainly does not lead back towards the hall. But it is no good flying blindly this way with the pursuit just behind. We cannot block the door. Its key is gone and the lock is broken, and it opens inwards. We must do something to delay the enemy first.

<div class="line_en">Suddenly, and to his own surprise, Frodo felt a hot wrath blaze up in his heart. "The Shire!

Black drops dripped from the blade and smoked on the floor. Boromir hurled himself against the door and slammed it again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然间，佛罗多感到胸中充满了怒气，这让他自己也大吃一惊。他大喊着“夏尔万岁！”跑到波罗莫身边，用刺针戳向那恐怖的大脚。外面传来一阵低吼声，那只脚跟着抽回去，差点将刺针从佛罗多的手上拔走。刀刃上滴下的黑色鲜血在地板上冒出一阵青烟，波罗莫把握住机会，使劲把门给再度推上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Heavy feet were heard in the corridor. Boromir flung himself against the door and heaved it to; then he wedged it with broken sword-blades and splinters of wood. The Company retreated to the other side of the chamber. But they had no chance to fly yet. There was a blow on the door that made it quiver; and then it began to grind slowly open, driving back the wedges. A huge arm and shoulder, with a dark skin of greenish scales, was thrust through the widening gap. Then a great, flat, toeless foot was forced through below. There was a dead silence outside.</div>

When thirteen had fallen the rest fled shrieking. leaving the defenders unharmed, except for Sam who had a scratch along the scalp. A quick duck had saved him; and he had felled his orc: a sturdy thrust with his Barrow-blade.

<div class="line_en">But even as they retreated, and before Pippin and Merry had reached the stair outside, a huge orc-chieftain, almost man-high, clad in black mail from head to foot, leaped into the chamber; behind him his followers clustered in the doorway. His broad flat face was swart, his eyes were like coals, and his tongue was red; he wielded a great spear. With a thrust of his huge hide shield he turned Boromir's sword and bore him backwards, throwing him to the ground. Diving under Aragorn's blow with the speed of a striking snake he charged into the Company and thrust with his spear straight at Frodo. The blow caught him on the right side, and Frodo was hurled against the wall and pinned. Sam, with a cry, hacked at the spear-shaft, and it broke. But even as the orc flung down the truncheon and swept out his scimitar, Anduril came down upon his helm. There was a flash like flame and the helm burst asunder. The orc fell with cloven head. His followers fled howling, as Boromir and Aragorn sprang at them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在他们开始撤退的时候，皮聘和梅里还没有跑到另一边的阶梯，一名身形巨大几乎和人齐高的半兽人酋长冲了进来。他全身从头到脚都披着黑色的锁子甲，部属们挤在他后面准备看首领大显神威。他的脸孔黝黑，双眸如同黑炭一般漆黑，舌头则是鲜红色的，手中拿着一柄巨大的长槍。他用沉重的兽皮盾一股脑格开波罗莫的利剑，把他撞得连连后退，摔倒在地上。接着，他用如同毒蛇一般的迅捷速度闪过阿拉贡的劈砍，冲进大伙阵形中央，一槍刺向佛罗多。这一槍正中佛罗多的右腰，让他往后直飞出去，卡在山壁上。山姆惊叫一声，扑上前去砍断槍身。在同一瞬间，那名半兽人快速的拔出腰间的弯刀，准备展开第二波攻势，不过，阿拉贡不会再给他第二次机会。圣剑安都瑞尔砍中他的头盔，一阵火花闪过，他的脑浆当场连着头盔的碎片四下飞溅，身躯则是彷佛极度不甘似地缓缓倒下。他的部属这时一哄而散，波罗莫和阿拉贡则是冲向前准备继续砍杀败逃的敌人。">查看中文翻译</div>

They groped their way down a long flight of steps, and then looked back; but they could see nothing, except high above them the faint glimmer of the wizard's staff. He seemed to be still standing on guard by the closed door. Frodo breathed heavily and leaned against Sam, who put his arms about him. They stood peering up the stairs into the darkness. Frodo thought he could hear the voice of Gandalf above, muttering words that ran down the sloping roof with a sighing echo. He could not catch what was said. The walls seemed to be trembling.

<div class="line_en">At the end of an hour they had gone a mile, or maybe a little more, and had descended many flights of stairs. There was still no sound of pursuit. Almost they began to hope that they would escape. At the bottom of the seventh flight Gandalf halted.</div>

There was no other sound of pursuit, neither tramp of feet, nor any voice. Gandalf took no turns, right or left, for the passage seemed to be going in the direction that he desired. Every now and again it descended a flight of steps, fifty or more, to a lower level. At the moment that was their chief danger; for in the dark they could not see a descent, until they came on it, and put their feet out into emptiness. Gandalf felt the ground with his staff like a blind man.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I do not know," answered Gandalf. "But I found myself suddenly faced by something that I have not met before.

I know many; but to do things of that kind rightly requires time, and even then the door can be broken by strength.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不知道，”甘道夫回答：“但我发现我面对的是前所未有的一股力量，除了试着封印那扇门之外，我根本想不出别的办法。我知道很多的封印法术，但都需要时间施展，而且就算成功了，敌人也可以硬用蛮力将它打开。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They peered out. Before them was another cavernous hall. It was loftier and far longer than the one in which they had slept. They were near its eastern end; westward it ran away into darkness. Down the centre stalked a double line of towering pillars. They were carved like boles of mighty trees whose boughs upheld the roof with a branching tracery of stone. Their stems were smooth and black, but a red glow was darkly mirrored in their sides. Right across the floor, close to the feet of two huge pillars a great fissure had opened. Out of it a fierce red light came, and now and again flames licked at the brink and curled about the bases of the columns. Wisps of dark smoke wavered in the hot air.</div>

Doom, doom rolled the drum-beats, growing louder and louder, doom, doom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="箭矢开始落在众人之间，又有另一支箭从佛罗多的身上弹开，另一支箭则是射穿了甘道夫的帽子，像是根黑色羽毛一般卡在那里。佛罗多忍不住回头打量这些敌人，透过摇曳的火焰，他依稀可以看见几百名的半兽人，他们扭曲的长矛和弯刀在火焰中反射着血红色的光芒。咚，咚，鼓声持续的响着，越来越大声，咚，咚。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Legolas turned and set an arrow to the string, though it was a long shot for his small bow. He drew, but his hand fell, and the arrow slipped to the ground. He gave a cry of dismay and fear. Two great trolls appeared; they bore great slabs of stone, and flung them down to serve as gangways over the fire. But it was not the trolls that had filled the Elf with terror. The ranks of the orcs had opened, and they crowded away, as if they themselves were afraid. Something was coming up behind them. What it was could not be seen: it was like a great shadow, in the middle of which was a dark form, of man-shape maybe, yet greater; and a power and terror seemed to be in it and to go before it.</div>

<div class="line_en">It came to the edge of the fire and the light faded as if a cloud had bent over it. Then with a rush it leaped across the fissure. The flames roared up to greet it, and wreathed about it; and a black smoke swirled in the air. Its streaming mane kindled, and blazed behind it. In its right hand was a blade like a stabbing tongue of fire; in its left it held a whip of many thongs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他走到火焰前，光芒跟着黯淡下来，彷佛被乌云遮住一般，接着，他跳过地上的裂隙，地心深处的火焰涌出恭迎它的大驾，点燃了他背上的鬃毛，牵扯出一长条火焰来。空气中黑烟舞动，激发出末日将临的恐怖感。这魔物右手拿着如同火舌一般形状不定的刀刃，另一只手则拿着火焰构成的九尾鞭。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The dark figure streaming with fire raced towards them. The orcs yelled and poured over the stone gangways. Then Boromir raised his horn and blew. Loud the challenge rang and bellowed, like the shout of many throats under the cavernous roof. For a moment the orcs quailed and the fiery shadow halted. Then the echoes died as suddenly as a flame blown out by a dark wind, and the enemy advanced again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那缀着火焰的黑暗形体冲向众人，半兽人大喊着越过充作桥梁的石板。接着，波罗莫吹响了号角，震耳欲聋，如同排山倒海，万人争鸣的声响震慑了半兽人，连火影也跟着停下脚步。然后，那回声就如同被黑风吹灭的火焰一般突然停息了，敌人又再度开始前进。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"You cannot pass," he said. The orcs stood still, and a dead silence fell. "I am a servant of the Secret Fire, wielder of the flame of Anor. You cannot pass. The dark fire will not avail you, flame of Udun. Go back to the Shadow! You cannot pass."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“邪灵止步！”他说。半兽人全都停了下来，现场陷入一片寂静。“我是秘火的服侍者、亚尔诺炽炎的持有者。邪灵止步！黑暗之火无法击倒我，邪婬的污顿之火啊！退回到魔影身边去！没有邪灵可以越过我的阻挡！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Over the bridge!" cried Gandalf, recalling his strength. "Fly! This is a foe beyond any of you. I must hold the narrow way. Fly! " Aragorn and Boromir did not heed the command, but still held their ground, side by side, behind Gandalf at the far end of the bridge. The others halted just within the doorway at the hall's end, and turned, unable to leave their leader to face the enemy alone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“快过桥！”甘道夫鼓起全身力气，大喊着：“快跑！不要回头。我必须要守住这条路，你们快跑！”阿拉贡和波罗莫不管他的命令，依旧坚守住桥的另一端，并肩站在甘道夫身后，等待他。其他人则是呆呆地站在桥对面的门廊边，不忍心让领队单独面对敌人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Balrog made no answer. The fire in it seemed to die, but the darkness grew. It stepped forward slowly on to the bridge, and suddenly it drew itself up to a great height, and its wings were spread from wall to wall; but still Gandalf could be seen, glimmering in the gloom; he seemed small, and altogether alone: grey and bent, like a wizened tree before the onset of a storm.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="炎魔没有回答，他体内的火焰似乎开始减弱，但黑暗则开始增加。他缓步踏上桥，突然间挺身站起来，张开的翅膀足足和整座大厅一样宽。但在这一团黑暗中，甘道夫的身影依旧清晰可见。他看来十分的矮小、孤单无助，如同面对风暴的枯萎老树一般。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Balrog reached the bridge. Gandalf stood in the middle of the span, leaning on the staff in his left hand, but in his other hand Glamdring gleamed, cold and white. His enemy halted again, facing him, and the shadow about it reached out like two vast wings. It raised the whip, and the thongs whined and cracked. Fire came from its nostrils. But Gandalf stood firm.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="炎魔走到桥上，甘道夫站在桥中央，左手倚着手杖，但另外一只手握着发出耀目白光的格兰瑞神剑。他的敌人又再度停下脚步面对他，对方的陰影如同一对巨大的翅膀一般伸向他。他举起九尾鞭，每一道分岔开始闪动着光芒，发出嘶嘶声，他的鼻孔冒出火焰，但甘道夫毫不退让。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">With a bound the Balrog leaped full upon the bridge. Its whip whirled and hissed.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a ringing clash and a stab of white fire. The Balrog fell back and its sword flew up in molten fragments. The wizard swayed on the bridge, stepped back a pace, and then again stood still.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一阵震耳欲聋的巨响传来，白炽的火焰四下飞舞。炎魔连连后退，火焰剑断碎成四下飞舞的白色岩浆。巫师的身形一晃，退了一步，又稳住脚步。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“刚铎永存！”波罗莫也跟着大喊冲上桥。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At that moment Gandalf lifted his staff, and crying aloud he smote the bridge before him. The staff broke asunder and fell from his hand. A blinding sheet of white flame sprang up. The bridge cracked. Right at the Balrog's feet it broke, and the stone upon which it stood crashed into the gulf, while the rest remained, poised, quivering like a tongue of rock thrust out into emptiness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在那一刻，甘道夫举起手杖，大喊着击向脚下的桥梁，手杖在他手上碎成赍粉。一道让人目眩的白焰窜起，桥梁发出断折的声音，在炎魔的脚下碎裂开来，他所站着的那一整块岩石都跟着落下无底深渊，其他的部分则如同一座石舌，危颤颤的悬在空中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">With a terrible cry the Balrog fell forward, and its shadow plunged down and vanished. But even as it fell it swung its whip, and the thongs lashed and curled about the wizard's knees, dragging him to the brink. He staggered and fell, grasped vainly at the stone, and slid into the abyss. "Fly, you fools! " he cried, and was gone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="炎魔发出惊天动地的喊声，落了下来，黑影跟着消失在深渊中。但就在他落下前，他手上的九尾鞭一挥，卷住了巫师的膝盖。他摇晃了几下，徒劳无功地试图抓住岩石，就这样落进无底深渊中。“你们这些笨蛋，快跑呀！”他拼尽最后一丝力气大喊。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They stumbled wildly up the great stairs beyond the door. Aragorn leading, Boromir at the rear. At the top was a wide echoing passage. Along this they fled. Frodo heard Sam at his side weeping, and then he found that he himself was weeping as he ran. Doom, doom, doom the drum-beats rolled behind, mournful now and slow; doom!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们步履不稳地冲上门后的阶梯。阿拉贡带着路，波罗莫走在最后。在楼梯的顶端是一条宽广的走道。他们沿着走道飞奔，佛罗多听见山姆在他身旁啜泣着，他发现自己也忍不住跟着边跑边哭泣。咚，咚，咚，的鼓声依旧跟在后方，现在变得缓慢，彷佛在哀悼什么一样。咚！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The fires went out, and blank darkness fell. The Company stood rooted with horror staring into the pit. Even as Aragorn and Boromir came flying back, the rest of the bridge cracked and fell. With a cry Aragorn roused them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="火焰消失了，整个大厅陷入一片黑暗。远征队的成员惊恐地不能动弹，眼睁睁地看着队长落入深渊中。就在阿拉贡和波罗莫刚踏上地板的瞬间，桥梁其余部分也跟着落了下去，阿拉贡的一声暴喊惊醒了众人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a guard of orcs crouching in the shadows behind the great door posts towering on either side, but the gates were shattered and cast down. Aragorn smote to the ground the captain that stood in his path, and the rest fled in terror of his wrath. The Company swept past them and took no heed of them. Out of the Gates they ran and sprang down the huge and age-worn steps, the threshold of Moria.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一群半兽人躲在两边的门柱中看守着大门，但大门本身已经倾倒在地上。阿拉贡满腔怒火正好无处发泄，一眨眼就砍下了守卫队长的脑袋，其他的半兽人见情势不对，纷纷开溜。远征队无暇顾及这些家伙，只是一个劲的跑出那古老的大门、陈旧的阶梯，离开摩瑞亚的土地。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They ran on. The light grew before them; great shafts pierced the roof. They ran swifter. They passed into a hall, bright with daylight from its high windows in the east. They fled across it. Through its huge broken doors they passed, and suddenly before them the Great Gates opened, an arch of blazing light.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们继续往前跑。前方出现了刺眼的光芒，巨大的通风口将外界的光线引导进来，他们跑得更快了。接着，一行人来到一个被东方的窗户照得十分明亮的房间，他们狂奔过这个房间，冲过一扇破碎的大门，来到充满耀目光芒的门廊前。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They looked back. Dark yawned the archway of the Gates under the mountain-shadow. Faint and far beneath the earth rolled the slow drum-beats: doom. A thin black smoke trailed out. Nothing else was to be seen; the dale all around was empty. Doom. Grief at last wholly overcame them, and they wept long: some standing and silent, some cast upon the ground. Doom, doom. The drum-beats faded.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们回头看去。黑暗的入口在陰影中大张着。他们可以听见微弱、遥远的缓慢鼓声，咚。一阵黑烟飘了出来，其他什么都看不见。河谷四下一片空旷。咚。他们这才有时间感受应有的痛苦和折磨，有些人站着掩面，有些人则是哭倒在地上。咚，咚。鼓声渐渐的消失了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They did not halt until they were out of bowshot from the walls. Dimrill Dale lay about them. The shadow of the Misty Mountains lay upon it, but eastwards there was a golden light on the land. It was but one hour after noon. The sun was shining; the clouds were white and high.</div>
