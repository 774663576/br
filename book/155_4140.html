<div class="line_cn" title="“可以。”这是爸爸对杰姆的请求的答复。杰姆先问爸爸我们可不可以去雷切尔小姐的鱼塘边上和迪尔坐一会儿，因为这是迪尔在梅科姆县的最后一个晚上。“代我向他告别，明年夏天我们会再见面的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr. Avery boarded across the street from Mrs. Henry Lafayette Dubose's house. Besides making change in the collection plate every Sunday, Mr. Avery sat on the porch every night until nine o'clock and sneezed. One evening we were privileged to witness a performance by him which seemed to have been his positively last, for he never did it again so long as we watched. Jem and I were leaving Miss Rachel's front steps one night when Dill stopped us: "Golly, looka yonder." He pointed across the street. At first we saw nothing but a kudzu-covered front porch, but a closer inspection revealed an arc of water descending from the leaves and splashing in the yellow circle of the street light, some ten feet from source to earth, it seemed to us. Jem said Mr. Avery misfigured, Dill said he must drink a gallon a day, and the ensuing contest to determine relative distances and respective prowess only made me feel left out again, as I was untalented in this area.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="艾弗里先生住在街对面，和亨利·拉斐特·杜博斯太太隔街相望。艾弗里先生每个星期日去教堂捐献时，总要在捐款盘里换些零钱。除了干这个外，他每天晚上坐在走廊上，一直坐到九点钟，然后打起喷嚏来。一天晚上，我们十分荣幸地看到了他的表演。那次表演看上去是最后一次，因为被我们注意以后，他再没表演过。那天晚上，杰姆和我正要离开雷切尔小姐前面的台阶，逋尔突然拦住我们：“天啊，看那边。”他指着街对面。开始，除了葡萄树遮盖的前廊外我们什么都没看见。可仔细一看，我们发现一道水弧从树叶上落下来，在街灯的昏暗光线中发出劈劈啪啪的溅水声。看上去从水源到地面之间有十英尺高。杰姆说艾弗里先生没尿准，迫尔说他一定是一天喝了一加仑。接着，他俩开始比赛，看谁尿得远，尿得猛，这使我感到又被抛下不管了，因为我在这个领域没有天赋。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dill and Jem were simply going to peep in the window with the loose shutter to see if they could get a look at Boo Radley, and if I didn't want to go with them I could go straight home and keep my fat flopping mouth shut, that was all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="原来，迪尔和杰姆要从那块松了一块叶板的百叶窗那儿向室内窥视，试试能不能看见拉德利，要是我不愿意跟他们去，可以立刻回家，但要守口如瓶，就这些。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We strolled silently down the sidewalk, listening to porch swings creaking with the weight of the neighborhood, listening to the soft night-murmurs of the grown people on our street. Occasionally we heard Miss Stephanie Crawford laugh.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们默默地在人行道上走着，听着人们在走廊的悬椅上压出的嘎吱嘎吱的声响，听着住在街道两旁的成年人夜间轻轻的谈话声。偶尔可以听到斯蒂芬尼·克劳福德小姐的笑声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“杰姆，请你……”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Because nobody could see them at night, because Atticus would be so deep in a book he wouldn't hear the Kingdom coming, because if Boo Radley killed them they'd miss school instead of vacation, and because it was easier to see inside a dark house in the dark than in the daytime, did I understand?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因为晚上没人能看见他们，因为阿迪克斯在全神看书，听不到外面的动静，还因为，如果布·拉德利把他们杀了，他们将要失去的是新的学期而不是假期。另外，从外面朝一间黑屋子里看，晚上比白天看得更清楚一些。杰姆问我懂不懂。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">With that, I had no option but to join them. We thought it was better to go under the high wire fence at the rear of the Radley lot, we stood less chance of being seen. The fence enclosed a large garden and a narrow wooden outhouse.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他这么一说，我没别的办法，只好跟他们一道去。我们觉得最好从拉德利家房子后面的很高的铁丝网下面钻过去，那样被人看见的可能性小一些。铁丝网围着一个很大的园子和一个窄狭的木厕所。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="因为要注意这一点，我的速度可能是一分钟一步。看到远远走在前面的杰姆在月光下向我招手时，我加快了速度。我们来到一道门前，这道门将园子与后院隔开。杰姆碰碰门，门咯吱咯吱响起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jem held up the bottom wire and motioned Dill under it. I followed, and held up the wire for Jem. It was a tight squeeze for him. "Don't make a sound," he whispered. "Don't get in a row of collards whatever you do, they'll wake the dead."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰姆掀起铁丝网的底部，示意要迪尔钻过去。我跟在迪尔后面，然后，替杰姆掀起铁丝网。杰姆勉强钻过来。“别弄出声响，”他小声说，“不管怎么样，别走到甘蓝地里去，否则死人也会被惊醒的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The back of the Radley house was less inviting than the front: a ramshackle porch ran the width of the house; there were two doors and two dark windows between the doors. Instead of a column, a rough two-by-four supported one end of the roof. An old Franklin stove sat in a corner of the porch; above it a hat-rack mirror caught the moon and shone eerily.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拉德利家的后面不如前面逗人喜欢：破烂不堪的走廊的长度与房子一样宽；有两扇门，两门之间有两扇窗，窗里一片漆黑；代替大圆柱的是一根二英寸厚四英寸宽的粗糙的术材，支撑着屋顶的一端；走廊上一个角落里有一个古老的富兰克林式的炉灶}炉灶上方有一面帽架上的镜子在月光下闪闪发光，令人不寒而栗。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We spat ourselves dry, and Jem opened the gate slowly, lifting it aside and resting it on the fence. We were in the back yard.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们一个个都吐得口里发干，然后杰姆轻轻推开门，把门从门墩儿上抬起，抽出来靠在一旁的栅栏上。我们进了后院。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That we would be obliged to dodge the unseen from all directions was confirmed when Dill ahead of us spelled G-o-d in a whisper. We crept to the side of the house, around to the window with the hanging shutter. The sill was several inches taller than Jem.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="前面杰姆轻轻的一声叫证明我们不得不小心谨慎，不要碰上那些看不见的东西。我们弯着腰摸到房子侧面，然后朝有一块松了叶板的窗子移近。窗台比杰姆高几英寸。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Let's get away from here," breathed Jem. "Let's go 'round in back again. Sh-h," he warned me, as I was about to protest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们要离开这里，”杰娲说，“我们再回到后边去。嘘。”我正要说话，他先发出了警告。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dill stopped and let Jem go ahead. When Jem put his foot on the bottom step, the step squeaked. He stood still, then tried his weight by degrees. The step was silent. Jem skipped two steps, put his foot on the porch, heaved himself to it, and teetered a long moment. He regained his balance and dropped to his knees. He crawled to the window, raised his head and looked in.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪尔停下来，让杰姆走在前面。杰姆踏上楼梯的最底下一级时，楼梯略吱一下响起来。他停下来不敢再动。然后，一点点移上去。楼梯不响了。杰姆连跨两级踏上走廊，身子也跟了上去，然后踉踉跄跄地好一阵才站稳。他弯下双膝，徐徐爬到窗下，抬起头向室内望去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="这时，我看见了一个黑影。这是一个戴着帽子的男人的影子。开始，我以为是树，但是当时没有风，树干是不能走动的。整个后廊沫浴在月光之中，那影子从走廊那一端朝杰姆走来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Had Jem's pants been safely on him, we would not have slept much anyway. Every night-sound I heard from my cot on the back porch was magnified three-fold; every scratch of feet on gravel was Boo Radley seeking revenge, every passing Negro laughing in the night was Boo Radley loose and after us; insects splashing against the screen were Boo Radley's insane fingers picking the wire to pieces; the chinaberry trees were malignant, hovering, alive. I lingered between sleep and wakefulness until I heard Jem murmur.</div>

<div class="line_en">He went the back way, through Deer's Pasture, across the schoolyard and around to the fence, I thought -- at least that was the way he was headed.
