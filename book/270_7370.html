<div class="line_en">The counter in Alice's bathroom was covered with a thousand different products, all claiming to beautify a person's surface. Since everyone in this house was both perfect and impermeable, I could only assume that she'd bought most of these things with me in mind. I read the labels numbly, struck by the waste.</div>

<div class="line_en">How many hours had I waited for Charlie to finally leave Billy's house so that I could see Jacob? Each minute, not knowing if Jacob was still breathing or not, had seemed like ten lifetimes. And then, when at last I'd been allowed to go, to see for myself that Jacob was alive, the time had gone so quickly. I felt like I'd barely caught my breath before Alice was calling Edward, insisting that I keep up this ridiculous sleepover facade. It seemed so insignificant…</div>

<div class="line_en">"Jacob's still unconscious," Alice answered. "Carlisle or Edward will call when he's awake. Anyway, you need to go see Charlie. He was there at Billy's house, he saw that Carlisle and Edward are back in from their trip, and he's bound to be suspicious when you get home."</div>

<div class="line_en">"You need to think of Charlie now. You've had a long day -- sorry, I know that doesn't begin to cover it -- but that doesn't mean that you can shirk your responsibilities." Her voice was serious, almost chiding. "It's more important now than ever that Charlie stays safely in the dark. Play your role first, Bella, and then you can do what you want second. Part of being a Cullen is being meticulously responsible."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你现在需要想一想查理，今天你经历了漫长的一天——对不起，我知道那还不足以表达这层意思——但是那并不意味着你就能逃避责任。”她的声音很严肃，几乎是责备，“现在查理安全地被蒙在鼓里比任何时候都更重要。首先尽到你的责任，贝拉，其次你就可以做任何你想做的事了。当卡伦家的一分子行为谨慎负责是不可分割的一部分。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Of course she was right. And if not for this same reason -- a reason that was more powerful than all my fear and pain and guilt -- Carlisle would never have been able to talk me into leaving Jacob's side, unconscious or not.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她当然是对的。如果不是因为相同的原因——一个比我的恐惧、痛苦和内疚更强有力的原因——卡莱尔永远都无法说服我离开雅各布的身边，不管他昏迷与否。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Jacob is fine, Bella," Alice said, easily interpreting my preoccupation. "There's no hurry. If you realized how much extra morphine Carlisle had to give him -- what with his temperature burning it off so quickly -- you would know that he's going to be out for a while."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“雅各布没事，贝拉，”爱丽丝说道，非常容易地就看透了我当下最担心的事情，“不必着急，如果你意识到卡莱尔不得不额外给他注射了多少吗啡——他的体温很快就把药水蒸发掉了——你就会知道用不了多久他就会好起来了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There were many things I needed to think of, but I couldn't seem to get her out of my head, the newborn whose other life was now -- abruptly -- over. Her face, twisted with desire for my blood, lingered behind my eyelids.</div>

<div class="line_en">Alice, however, found the question very interesting. "Jasper, too, Bella -- his talent works on your body just as well as it does on anyone else's. That's the difference, do you see it? Jasper's abilities affect the body physically. He really does calm your system down, or excite it. It's not an illusion. And I see visions of outcomes, not the reasons and thoughts behind the decisions that create them. It's outside the mind, not an illusion, either; reality, or at least one version of it. But Jane and Edward and Aro and Demetri -- they work inside the mind. Jane only creates an illusion of pain. She doesn't really hurt your body, you only think you feel it. You see, Bella? You are safe inside your mind. No one can reach you there. It's no wonder that Aro was so curious about your future abilities."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，爱丽丝却发现这个问题很有趣：“贾斯帕也是如此，贝拉——他的天赋用在你身上的效果和在别人身上是一样的。那就是区别，你明白吗？贾斯帕的能力带给身体的影响是肉体上的。他真的可以使你的系统平静下来，或者兴奋起来。那不是幻觉，而我能预见有结果的事情的后果，并不是这些决定背后的原因或思想创造了它们。这是大脑之外的东西，也不是幻觉；是事实，或者至少是事实的一种情况，但是简、爱德华和阿罗以及德米特里——他们都是在大脑内部起作用的。简只是创造了痛苦的幻觉。她没有真正地伤害你的身体，你只是觉得你感觉到了。明白吗，贝拉？你在自己的大脑内部很安全。没有人能到达你头脑中的那个地方，难怪阿罗对你未来的能力会如此好奇的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The worst part…" I hesitated, and then let words spill out in a flood of truth. "The worst part is that I saw the whole thing -- our whole life. And I want it bad, Jake, I want it all. I want to stay right here and never move. I want to love you and make you happy. And I can't, and it's killing me. It's like Sam and Emily, Jake -- I never had a choice. I always knew nothing would change. Maybe that's why I was fighting against you so hard."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“最糟糕的地方……”我犹豫了，接着话语一股脑儿全都汩汩地涌现出来了，“最糟糕的地方是我看见一切——我们完整的人生，而且我很想要，杰克，我都想要。我想要待在这里，永远都不要动。我想爱你，让你开心，而我不能，这会杀死我的。我一直都知道不会有任何改变，或许那就是我为什么那么强烈地抗拒你的原因。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Lots of things." I worked to make my voice lighter, but I stayed honest. "I've never been much of a masochist, so I'm not looking forward to the pain. And I wish there was some way to keep him away -- I don't want him to suffer with me, but I don't think there's any way around it.
