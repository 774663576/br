<div class="line_en">He went up to her. He was filled with a feeling of unutterable bliss at the thought that he had found her at last and could be there with her. He sat down at her side, said something to her, and she said something back. She radiated calm. Her hand made slow, supple movements. All his life he had longed for the calm of her movements. Feminine calm had eluded him all his life.</div>

<div class="line_en">Several half-naked women were trying to wind themselves around him, but he was tired, and to extricate himself from them he opened the door leading to the next room. There, just opposite him, he saw a young woman lying on her side on a couch. She, too, was half-naked: she wore nothing but panties. Leaning on her elbow, she looked up at him with a smile that said she had known he would come.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他置身于一群半裸的女人中间，她们围着他旋转，他感到很疲倦。为了躲开她们，他打开了通向隔壁房间的门。他看到面前有一个年轻姑娘躺在长沙发上。她也是半裸着，只穿了条三角裤；她侧躺着，上身由臂肘撑着。她微笑着看着他，就好像知道他会来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But just then the dream began its slide back to reality. He found himself back in that no-man's-land where we are neither asleep nor awake. He was horrified by the prospect of seeing the young woman vanish before his eyes and said to himself, God, how I'd hate to lose her! He tried desperately to remember who she was, where he'd met her, what they'd experienced together. How could he possibly forget when she knew him so well? He promised himself to phone her first thing in the morning. But no sooner had he made the promise than he realized he couldn't keep it: he didn't know her name. How could he forget the name of someone he knew so well? By that time he was almost completely awake, his eyes were open, and he was asking himself, Where am I? Yes, I'm in Prague, but that woman, does she live here too? Didn't I meet her somewhere else? Could she be from Switzerland? It took him quite some time to get it into his head that he didn't know the woman, that she wasn't from Prague or Switzerland, that she inhabited his dream and nowhere else.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但就在这时，他从熟睡中滑落到半清醒的状态。他进入了这个no ma‘s land，睡不着却仍没清醒过来。他绝望地发现这个女人消失了，心里想：天哪！我不能失去她！他竭尽全力去回想是在何处碰到她的，和她一起经历过什么。既然这么熟悉，怎么会想不起来呢？他暗暗决定，一定要在第一时间给她打电话。但他马上颤抖了起来，他不能给她打电话，因为他想不起她的名字了。他怎么会把一个他如此熟悉的人的名字给忘了呢？紧接着，他差不多全醒了过来，睁开了双眼，心里想：我在哪儿？对了，我在布拉格，这个女人是布拉格的吗？难道不是我在别的地方遇到的？也许是在瑞士认识她的？过了一段时间，他才明白他并不认识这个女人，她既不是苏黎世的也不是布拉格的，她只在梦中，而不在任何别的地方。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He suddenly recalled the famous myth from Plato's Symposium: People were hermaphrodites until God split them in two, and now all the halves wander the world over seeking one another. Love is the longing for the half of ourselves we have lost.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他想起了柏拉图《会饮篇》中那个著名传说：以前人类是两性同体的，上帝把他们分成了两半，从那时起，这两半就开始在世界上游荡，相互寻找。爱情，是对我们自己失去的另一半的渴望。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was so upset he sat straight up in bed. Tereza was breathing deeply beside him. The woman in the dream, he thought, was unlike any he had ever met. The woman he felt he knew most intimately of all had turned out to be a woman he did not even know. And yet she was the one he had always longed for. If a personal paradise were ever to exist for him, then in that paradise he would have to live by her side. The woman from his dream was the Es muss sein! of his love.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他迷惑不解，起身坐到了床边。特蕾莎在他身旁深深地呼吸着。他想，梦中的那个年轻女人不像他生活里认识的任何一个女人。这个年轻女人对他来说是那么熟悉，但实际上却完全不认识。但她正是他一直所渴望的。如果有一天他找到了他个人的天堂，假设这个天堂存在的话，他要和这个女人一起在那儿生活。他梦中的那个年轻女人，是他爱情的“es muss sein”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Let us suppose that such is the case, that somewhere in the world each of us has a partner who once formed part of our body. Tomas's other part is the young woman he dreamed about. The trouble is, man does not find the other part of himself. Instead, he is sent a Tereza in a bulrush basket. But what happens if he nevertheless later meets the one who was meant for him, the other part of himself? Whom is he to prefer? The woman from the bulrush basket or the woman from Plato's myth?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="假定事情是这样的，我们每个人在世界的某个地方都有着另一半，以前它和我们组成的是同一个身体。托马斯的另一半，就是他梦见的那个年轻女人。但没有人会找到自己的另一半。代替这一半的，是别人放在篮子里，顺流漂送给他的特蕾莎。可如果以后他真遇到了命中注定的那个女人，遇到了他自己的另一半呢？他会选谁呢？是在篮子里捡到的女人，还是柏拉图传说中的女人呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She is alone and stops to look in at him with an infinitely sad expression in her eyes. He cannot withstand her glance. Again, he feels her pain in his own heart. Again, he falls prey to compassion and sinks deep into her soul. He leaps out of the window, but she tells him bitterly to stay where he feels happy, making those abrupt, angular movements that so annoyed and displeased him. He grabs her nervous hands and presses them between his own to calm them. And he knows that time and again he will abandon the house of his happiness, time and again abandon his paradise and the woman from his dream and betray the Es muss sein! of his love to go off with Tereza, the woman born of six laughable fortuities.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她孤独一人，停在人行道上，远远地，向他投去无限悲哀的目光。而他，则不能承受这样的目光。又一次，他在自己的内心感到了特蕾莎的痛苦！又一次，他成了同情的俘虏，堕入了特蕾莎的灵魂。他从窗口跳下去。但特蕾莎苦涩地对他说，他只需呆在他觉得幸福的地方，她的一举一动又生硬又不连贯，总是让他讨厌，总让他扫兴。他一把抓住她紧张的双手，紧紧地握在他的手里，让它们平静下来。他知道自己已经准备随时离开他幸福的家，准备随时离开与他梦中的年轻姑娘一起生活的天堂，他要背叛爱情的“es muss sein”跟着特蕾莎，跟着这个缘于六次滑稽的偶然的女人走。">查看中文翻译</div>
