<div class="line_en">One morning, about ten days after Mrs. Churchill's decease, Emma was called downstairs to Mr. Weston, who "could not stay five minutes, and wanted particularly to speak with her." -- He met her at the parlour-door, and hardly asking her how she did, in the natural key of his voice, sunk it immediately, to say, unheard by her father, "Can you come to Randalls at any time this morning? -- Do, if it be possible. Mrs. Weston wants to see you. She must see you."</div>

<div class="line_en">Emma found that she must wait; and now it required little effort. She asked no more questions therefore, merely employed her own fancy, and that soon pointed out to her the probability of its being some money concern-something just come to light, of a disagreeable nature in the circumstances of the family, -- something which the late event at Richmond had brought forward. Her fancy was very active. Half a dozen natural children, perhaps-and poor Frank cut off! -- This, though very undesirable, would be no matter of agony to her. It inspired little more than an animating curiosity.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱玛觉得只有等待了，不过并不那么难挨了。于是她不再发问了，只是发挥自己的想象，脑子里很快就冒出一个念头：事情说不定跟钱财有关系——家境方面刚暴露出什么令人不快的事情，是里士满最近发生的不幸引起的。她越想越悬乎。也许发现了五六个私生子——可怜的弗兰克剥夺了继承权！这种事虽说很糟糕，但却不会使她为之痛苦，只不过激起了她的好奇心。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"He knew nothing about it, Emma. On this article I can fully acquit him. It was a private resolution of hers, not communicated to him-or at least not communicated in a way to carry conviction. -- Till yesterday, I know he said he was in the dark as to her plans. They burst on him, I do not know how, but by some letter or message -- and it was the discovery of what she was doing, of this very project of hers, which determined him to come forward at once, own it all to his uncle, throw himself on his kindness, and, in short, put an end to the miserable state of concealment that had been carrying on so long."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他不知道这件事呵，爱玛。在这一点上，我敢说他完全是无辜的。那是简私自决定的，没跟他交换意见——至少没有明确地商量。我知道，他说直到昨天他还蒙在鼓里，不知道简的计划。他址突然知道的，我也不清楚是怎么知道的，也许此收到信了，或是接到了回信——正是因为发现了简的举动，获悉了她的这项汁划，他才决定立即采取主动，向他舅舅坦白一切，求他宽恕。总之，结束这隐瞒已久所造成的痛苦状态。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Most favourably for his nephew-gave his consent with scarcely a difficulty. Conceive what the events of a week have done in that family! While poor Mrs. Churchill lived, I suppose there could not have been a hope, a chance, a possibility; -- but scarcely are her remains at rest in the family vault, than her husband is persuaded to act exactly opposite to what she would have required. What a blessing it is, when undue influence does not survive the grave! --</div>

<div class="line_en">"This was settled last night, and Frank was off with the light this morning. He stopped at Highbury, at the Bates's, I fancy, some time-and then came on hither; but was in such a hurry to get back to his uncle, to whom he is just now more necessary than ever, that, as I tell you, he could stay with us but a quarter of an hour. -- He was very much agitated-very much, indeed-to a degree that made him appear quite a different creature from any thing I had ever seen him before. -- In addition to all the rest, there had been the shock of finding her so very unwell, which he had had no previous suspicion of -- and there was every appearance of his having been feeling a great deal."</div>

What has it been but a system of hypocrisy and deceit, -- espionage, and treachery? -- To come among us with professions of openness and simplicity; and such a league in secret to judge us all! -- Here have we been, the whole winter and spring, completely duped, fancying ourselves all on an equal footing of truth and honour, with two people in the midst of us who may have been carrying round, comparing and sitting in judgment on sentiments and words that were never meant for both to hear. -- They must take the consequence, if they have heard each other spoken of in a way not perfectly agreeable!"</div>

His wife gave him a look which invited him in; and, while he was coming round, added, "Now, dearest Emma, let me intreat you to say and look every thing that may set his heart at ease, and incline him to be satisfied with the match. Let us make the best of it-and, indeed, almost every thing may be fairly said in her favour. It is not a connexion to gratify; but if Mr. Churchill does not feel that, why should we? and it may be a very fortunate circumstance for him, for Frank, I mean, that he should have attached himself to a girl of such steadiness of character and good judgment as I have always given her credit for -- and still am disposed to give her credit for, in spite of this one great deviation from the strict rule of right.

<div class="line_en">A glance or two between him and his wife, convinced him that all was as right as this speech proclaimed; and its happy effect on his spirits was immediate. His air and voice recovered their usual briskness: he shook her heartily and gratefully by the hand, and entered on the subject in a manner to prove, that he now only wanted time and persuasion to think the engagement no very bad thing. His companions suggested only what could palliate imprudence, or smooth objections; and by the time they had talked it all over together, and he had talked it all over again with Emma, in their walk back to Hartfield, he was become perfectly reconciled, and not far from thinking it the very best thing that Frank could possibly have done.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="韦斯顿先生跟太太对视了一两眼后便意识到，正如这番话所表明的那样，一切都顺顺当当，因而立刻高兴起来。看他的神态，听他的声音，他又恢复了往常的活跃。他满怀感激之情，一把抓住太太的手，跟她谈起了这件事，那样子足以证明：只要给以时间，让他听听别人的话，他就会相信这还不算是件很坏的亲事。他的两个同伴说的话，只是想为弗兰克的鲁莽行为开脱，使他不至于反对这门亲事。等他们三人一起谈完了这件事，他送爱玛回哈特菲尔德途中跟爱玛又谈了一阵之后，他已经完全想通了，差不多快要认为：这是弗兰克所能做的最令人满意的事了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Much, indeed!" cried Emma feelingly. "If a woman can ever be excused for thinking only of herself, it is in a situation like Jane Fairfax's. -- Of such, one may almost say, that `the world is not their's, nor the world's law.'"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“的确情有可原！”爱玛感慨地嚷道。“如果一个女人只为自己着想还可以原谅的话，那只有处在简·费尔法克斯小姐那样的地位。对于这种人，你简直可以说：‘这世界不是他们的，这世界的法律也约束不到他们。’”【注：爱玛在仿效引用莎士比亚所著悲剧《罗密欧与朱丽叶》第五幕第一场中的一句话，原话为：“这世界不是你的朋友，这世界的法律也保护不到你。”】">查看中文翻译</div>
