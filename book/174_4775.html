<div class="line_en">If you shut your eyes and are a lucky one, you may see at times a shapeless pool of lovely pale colours suspended in the darkness; then if you squeeze your eyes tighter, the pool begins to take shape, and the colours become so vivid that with another squeeze they must go on fire. But just before they go on fire you see the lagoon. This is the nearest you ever get to it on the mainland, just one heavenly moment; if there could be two moments you might see the surf and hear the mermaids singing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果你闭上双眼，碰上你运气好，你有时会看见黑暗中悬浮着一汪池水，没有一定的形状，颜色淡白，十分可爱。然后，你把眼睛眯一眯，水池就现出了形状，颜色变得更加鲜明；再眯得紧些，那颜色就变得像着了火似的。但就在它着火燃烧以前，你就瞥见了那礁湖。这便是你在大陆上所能看到的礁湖的最逼近的景象，仅仅是美妙的一瞬间，要是能有两瞬间，你也许还能看见拍岸的浪花，听见人鱼的歌唱。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The children often spent long summer days on this lagoon, swimming or floating most of the time, playing the mermaid games in the water, and so forth. You must not think from this that the mermaids were on friendly terms with them: on the contrary, it was among Wendy's lasting regrets that all the time she was on the island she never had a civil word from one of them. When she stole softly to the edge of the lagoon she might see them by the score, especially on Marooners' Rock, where they loved to bask, combing out their hair in a lazy way that quite irritated her; or she might even swim, on tiptoe as it were, to within a yard of them, but then they saw her and dived, probably splashing her with their tails, not by accident, but intentionally.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="孩子们时常在礁湖上消磨长长的夏日，多半在水里游泳，或在水上漂浮，玩着人鱼的游戏，等等。你不要因此以为，人鱼们和他们友好相处；恰恰相反，温迪在岛上的时候，从来没有听到她们对她说过一句客气的话，她感到这永远是她的一个遗憾。当她偷偷地走近湖边时，她就看到成群的人鱼；特别是在流囚岩上、她们喜欢在那儿晒太阳，梳理她们的长发，那神态撩得她心里怪痒痒的。她可以像是踮着脚走路似的，轻轻游到离她们一码远的地方；可这时她们发现了她，就纷纷纵身潜入水中，或许还故意用尾巴撩水溅她一身。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The most haunting time at which to see them is at the turn of the moon, when they utter strange wailing cries; but the lagoon is dangerous for mortals then, and until the evening of which we have now to tell, Wendy had never seen the lagoon by moonlight, less from fear, for of course Peter would have accompanied her, than because she had strict rules about every one being in bed by seven. She was often at the lagoon, however, on sunny days after rain, when the mermaids come up in extraordinary numbers to play with their bubbles. The bubbles of many colours made in rainbow water they treat as balls, hitting them gaily from one to another with their tails, and trying to keep them in the rainbow till they burst. The goals are at each end of the rainbow, and the keepers only are allowed to use their hands. Sometimes a dozen of these games will be going on in the lagoon at a time, and it is quite a pretty sight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看人鱼最魅人的时间，是在月亮初升时；那时，她们会发出奇异的哭号声。不过，那时候礁湖对于人类是危险的，在我们要谈到的那个夜晚之前，温迪从来没见过月光下的礁湖。她倒不是害怕，因为，彼得当然会陪伴她的；而是因为，她有严格的规定，一到七点钟，人人都必须上床睡觉。她时常在雨过天晴的日子来到湖畔，那时，人鱼大批地到水面上来，玩着水泡。彩虹般的水做成的五颜六色的水泡，她们当作球，用尾巴欢快地拍来拍去，试着把他们拍进彩虹，直到破碎为止。球门就在彩虹的两端，只有守门员才许可用手接球。有时，礁湖里有几百个人鱼同时在玩水泡，真是一大奇观。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They treated all the boys in the same way, except of course Peter, who chatted with them on Marooners' Rock by the hour, and sat on their tails when they got cheeky. He gave Wendy one of their combs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="人鱼们对待男孩子们也是这样，当然彼得是例外，彼得和她们坐在流囚岩上长时间地谈天，在她们嬉皮笑脸的时候，骑上她们的尾巴。他把她们的一把梳子给了温迪。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But the moment the children tried to join in they had to play by themselves, for the mermaids immediately disappeared. Nevertheless we have proof that they secretly watched the interlopers, and were not above taking an idea from them; for John introduced a new way of hitting the bubble, with the head instead of the hand, and the mermaids adopted it. This is the one mark that John has left on the Neverland.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，孩子们刚想参加她们的游戏，人鱼们就立刻钻进水里不见了，孩子们只得自己玩了。不过，我们有证据知道她们在暗中窥视着这帮不速之客，并且也很乐意从孩子们那儿学到点什么。因为约翰引进了一种打水泡的新方法，用头而不是用手，于是人鱼守门员就采用了这方法。这是约翰留在永无乡的一个遗迹。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It must also have been rather pretty to see the children resting on a rock for half an hour after their mid-day meal. Wendy insisted on their doing this, and it had to be a real rest even though the meal was make-believe. So they lay there in the sun, and their bodies glistened in it, while she sat beside them and looked important.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="孩子们在午饭后，躺在岩石上休息半小时，这景象也是挺好看的。温迪一定要他们这样做，即使午饭是假装的，午休也必须是真的。所以他们全都在阳光下躺着，他们的身体给太阳晒得油光锃亮的，温迪坐在他们旁边，显得很神气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was one such day, and they were all on Marooners' Rock. The rock was not much larger than their great bed, but of course they all knew how not to take up much room, and they were dozing, or at least lying with their eyes shut, and pinching occasionally when they thought Wendy was not looking. She was very busy, stitching.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在这样的一天，他们全都躺在流囚岩上。岩石并不比他们的床大多少，不过，他们当然都懂得，不要多占地方。他们打着盹；或者，至少是闭着眼睛，趁温迪不注意时，不时互相挤捏一下。温迪正忙着做针钱活。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">While she stitched a change came to the lagoon. Little shivers ran over it, and the sun went away and shadows stole across the water, turning it cold. Wendy could no longer see to thread her needle, and when she looked up, the lagoon that had always hitherto been such a laughing place seemed formidable and unfriendly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正缝着缝着，礁湖上起了变化。水面掠过一阵微颤，太阳隐去不见了，阴影笼罩着湖面，湖水变冷了。温迪穿针都看不见了。她抬头一看，一向是喜笑颜开的瞧湖，这时变得狰狞可怕、不怀好意的了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="她知道，不是黑夜来到了，而是某种像夜一样黑暗的东西来到了。不，比夜还要黑暗。那东西没有到来，可是，它先从海上送来一阵颤抖，预示它就要到来。那是什么呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There crowded upon her all the stories she had been told of Marooners' Rock, so called because evil captains put sailors on it and leave them there to drown. They drown when the tide rises, for then it is submerged.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她一下子想起了所有那些她听到过的、关于流囚岩的故事。之所以叫流囚岩，是因为恶船长把水手丢在岩石上，让他们淹死在那儿。当海潮涨起时，岩石被淹没了，水手们就淹死了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Of course she should have roused the children at once; not merely because of the unknown that was stalking toward them, but because it was no longer good for them to sleep on a rock grown chilly. But she was a young mother and she did not know this; she thought you simply must stick to your rule about half an hour after the mid-day meal. So, though fear was upon her, and she longed to hear male voices, she would not waken them. Even when she heard the sound of muffled oars, though her heart was in her mouth, she did not waken them. She stood over them to let them have their sleep out. Was it not brave of Wendy?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，她应该立刻叫醒孩子们；因为，不仅莫名的危险就要临头，而且睡在一块变冷的岩石上，也不利于健康。可是，她是一个年幼的母亲，不懂得这个道理；她以为，必须严格遵守午饭后休息半小时的规矩。所以，虽然她害怕极了，渴望听见男性的声音，可她不想叫醒他们。甚至在她听到了闷声闷气的划桨声，心都跳到嘴里的时候，她还是没叫醒他们。她站在他们身边，让他们睡足。温迪难道还不勇敢吗？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“海盗！”他喊道。别的孩子都围拢到他身边。一丝奇特的笑意，浮现在他的脸上，温迪看到，不禁打了个寒颤。他脸上露出这种微笑的时候，没有人敢和他说话，他们只能站着静候他的命令。命令下得又快又锐利。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The boat drew nearer. It was the pirate dinghy, with three figures in her, Smee and Starkey, and the third a captive, no other than Tiger Lily. Her hands and ankles were tied, and she knew what was to be her fate. She was to be left on the rock to perish, an end to one of her race more terrible than death by fire or torture, for is it not written in the book of the tribe that there is no path through water to the happy hunting-ground? Yet her face was impassive; she was the daughter of a chief, she must die as a chief's daughter, it is enough.</div>

<div class="line_en">Peter was not quite like other boys; but he was afraid at last. A tremour ran through him, like a shudder passing over the sea; but on the sea one shudder follows another till there are hundreds of them, and Peter felt just the one. Next moment he was standing erect on the rock again, with that smile on his face and a drum beating within him. It was saying, "To die will be an awfully big adventure."</div>
