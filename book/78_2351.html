<div class="line_en">"You look like you wanted that one, sonny," the shopkeeper said pleasantly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“看来你正需要这块糖，孩子。”店老板高兴地说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"One Wonka's Whipple-Scrumptious Fudge-mallow Delight," he said, remembering how much he had loved the one he had on his birthday.</div>

<div class="line_en">The man behind the counter looked fat and well-fed. He had big lips and fat cheeks and a very fat neck. The fat around his neck bulged out all around the top of his collar like a rubber ring. He turned and reached behind him for the chocolate bar, then he turned back again and handed it to Charlie. Charlie grabbed it and quickly tore off the wrapper and took an enormous bite. Then he took another… and another… and oh, the joy of being able to cram large pieces of something sweet and solid into one's mouth! The sheer blissful joy of being able to fill one's mouth with rich solid food!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="柜台后面的人看来吃得很好，胖胖的。他厚嘴唇，胖脸，脖子也非常胖，脖子周围的肥肉在领子上面鼓起来，像一个橡皮轮胎。他转过身去拿身后的一块巧克力糖，再转过身来递给查理。查理把它一把抓住，马上撕掉包糖纸，咬了一大口。接着又是一口…又是一口…噢，能大口大口吃一整块甜甜的巧克力糖，这多么痛快啊！能把这么多食物塞满一嘴，这简直是无上快乐！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The shopkeeper put Charlie's change on the counter. "Take it easy," he said. "It'll give you a tummy-ache if you swallow it like that without chewing."</div>

<div class="line_en">Charlie went on wolfing the chocolate. He couldn't stop. And in less than half a minute, the whole thing had disappeared down his throat. He was quite out of breath, but he felt marvellously, extraordinarily happy. He reached out a hand to take the change. Then he paused. His eyes were just above the level of the counter. They were staring at the silver coins lying there. The coins were all five-penny pieces. There were nine of them altogether. Surely it wouldn't matter if he spent just one more…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="查理继续狼吞虎咽地吃那块巧克力糖。他停不下来。不到半分钟，整块巧克力糖已经进了他的喉咙不见了。他简直连气也透不过来，但是觉得异常痛快。他伸手去拿找给他的钱。但他停下来了。他的眼睛与柜台齐平。它们盯住了柜台上那些银币。全是五便士一枚的银币，一共九枚。仅仅再花掉一枚绝对没有关系…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Why not?" the fat shopkeeper said, reaching behind him again and taking another Whipple-Scrumptious Fudgemallow Delight from the shelf. He laid it on the counter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没问题，”胖老板说着又转过身去，从架子上再拿下一块旺卡的一流开心牛奶巧克力软糖。他把糖放在柜台上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Charlie picked it up and tore off the wrapper… and suddenly… from underneath the wrapper… there came a brilliant flash of gold.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="查理把它拿起来，撕开包糖纸…忽然之间…从包糖纸里…闪出一道耀眼的金光。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I think," he said quietly, "I think… I'll have just one more of those chocolate bars. The same kind as before, please."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我想，”他轻轻地说，“我想…我想再买一块那种巧克力糖，跟刚才那块一样的，谢谢你。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's a Golden Ticket!" screamed the shopkeeper, leaping about a foot in the air. "You've got a Golden Ticket! You've found the last Golden Ticket! Hey, would you believe it! Come and look at this, everybody! The kid's found Wonka's last Golden Ticket! There it is! It's right here in his hands!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是一张金奖券！”店老板腾空跳了几乎一英尺高，大叫着，“你得到了一张金奖券！你找到了最后一张金奖券！哎，你能相信吗？大家快过来看哪！这孩子找到了旺卡的最后一张金奖券！就在这里！就在他的手里！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It seemed as though the shopkeeper might be going to have a fit. "In my shop, too!" he yelled. "He found it right here in my own little shop! Somebody call the newspapers quick and let them know! Watch out now, sonny! Don't tear it as you unwrap it! That thing's precious!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这店老板好像要发狂了。“而且是在我的店里！”他叫道，“他就在我这小店里找到了它！你们哪一位快去通知报馆，告诉他们！现在小心点，孩子！把它拉出来的时候不要把它撕坏了！这张纸太贵重了！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In a few seconds, there was a crowd of about twenty people clustering around Charlie, and many more were pushing their way in from the street. Everybody wanted to get a look at the Golden Ticket and at the lucky finder.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不到几秒钟，二十几个人就围住了查理，还有更多的人从街上挤进来。人人都想见识见识这张金奖券和这位幸运得主。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“奖券在哪里？”有人大声问道，“把它举高，让我们都能看到它！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"How did he manage to find it, I'd like to know?" a large boy shouted angrily. "Twenty bars a day I've been buying for weeks and weeks!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我倒想知道他怎么会找到金奖券！”一个大男孩生气地叫道，“这几个星期，我每天都买上二十块这种巧克力糖！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“他需要吃啊，这皮包骨头的小家伙。”一个女孩笑着说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Charlie hadn't moved. He hadn't even unwrapped the Golden Ticket from around the chocolate. He was standing very still, holding it tightly with both hands while the crowd pushed and shouted all around him. He felt quite dizzy. There was a peculiar floating sensation coming over him, as though he were floating up in the air like a balloon. His feet didn't seem to be touching the ground at all. He could hear his heart thumping away loudly somewhere in his throat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="查理一动也不动。他甚至没有把裹着巧克力糖的金奖券抽出来。当周围的人又推搡又叫嚷的时候，他就这样一动不动地站在那里，双手紧紧抓住那张金奖券。他感到头晕眼花。他有一种奇怪的飘飘然的感觉，好像自己是个气球在空中飘来飘去。他的脚像是根本没有碰到地面。他能够听到他的心在喉咙里怦怦直跳。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"That's quite enough of that!" the fat shopkeeper shouted, pushing his way through the crowd and taking Charlie firmly by the arm. "Leave the kid alone, will you! Make way there! Let him out!" And to Charlie, as he led him to the door, he whispered, "Don't you let anybody have it! Take it straight home, quickly, before you lose it! Run all the way and don't stop till you get there, you understand?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“够了够了！”胖老板叫着从人群中挤过来，抓紧了查理的手臂，“别打扰这孩子好不好！让让路！让他出去！”他把查理送到店门口，悄悄地对查理说：“别让任何人得到它！趁没把它卖掉，快拿着它直接回家吧！一路跑回去，不到家不要停下来，明白吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At that point, he became aware of a hand resting lightly on his shoulder, and when he looked up, he saw a tall man standing over him. "Listen," the man whispered. "I'll buy it from you. I'll give you fifty pounds. How about it, eh? And I'll give you a new bicycle as well. Okay?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在这时候，查理感到有一只手轻轻地搭在他的肩上。他抬起头，看见一个高个子男人站在他面前。“听我说，”那人悄悄说，“我想买下你这张奖券。我给你五十英镑，怎么样，外加一辆新的自行车，好吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Are you crazy?" shouted a woman who was standing equally close. "Why, I'd give him two hundred pounds for that ticket! You want to sell that ticket for two hundred pounds, young man?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你疯了吗？”一个站得同样近的女人叫道，“哼，我愿给他两百英镑买下这张奖券！小朋友，你肯把这张奖券两百英镑卖给我吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Charlie nodded.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="查理点点头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You know something," the fat shopkeeper said, pausing a moment and smiling at Charlie, "I have a feeling you needed a break like this. I'm awfully glad you got it. Good luck to you, sonny."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你知道吗，”胖老板停了一下，对查理微笑着说，“我有一个感觉，你需要这样一个转机。你得到了它，我替你高兴。祝你好运，孩子。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Thank you," Charlie said, and off he went, running through the snow as fast as his legs would go. And as he flew past Mr Willy Wonka's factory, he turned and waved at it and sang out, "I'll be seeing you! I'll be seeing you soon!" And five minutes later he arrived at his own home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“谢谢你。”查理说着拔腿就跑，能跑多快跑多快，一路穿过雪地。当他飞也似的跑过威利·旺卡先生的工厂时，他转身对它挥手高唱：“我要来看你！我很快就要来看你！”五分钟后，他回到了自己的家。">查看中文翻译</div>
