<div class="line_en">"Well, that's a luxury we weren't given when they firebombed Twelve, but you're all so much cozier with the Capitol here," says Gale. By the look on Lyme's face, I think she might shoot him, or at least take a swing. She'd probably have the upper hand, too, with all her training. But her anger only seems to infuriate him and he yells, "We watched children burn to death and there was nothing we could do!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可是十二区被轰炸时，我们可没享受这样的待遇，你们因为靠近凯匹特已经比我们舒服多了。”盖尔的话一出口，莱姆的脸色变得很难看，看上去她恨不得一枪毙了他，或者至少跟他干一仗。她受过训练，兴许她还能占上风。但她的气愤只能是进一步激怒盖尔，他喊道：“当时我们也只能眼睁睁地看着我们区的孩子被烧死，也束手无措！”">查看中文翻译</div>

But then… I'm also a girl from District 12. Not President Snow. I can't help it. I can't condemn someone to the death he's suggesting. "Gale," I say, taking his arm and trying to speak in a reasonable tone. "The Nut's an old mine. It'd be like causing a massive coal mining accident." Surely the words are enough to make anyone from 12 think twice about the plan.</div>

<div class="line_en">Gale's plan exceeds anyone's expectations. Beetee was right about being unable to control the avalanches once they'd been set in motion. The mountainsides are naturally unstable, but weakened by the explosions, they seem almost fluid. Whole sections of the Nut collapse before our eyes, obliterating any sign that human beings have ever set foot on the place. We stand speechless, tiny and insignificant, as waves of stone thunder down the mountain. Burying the entrances under tons of rock. Raising a cloud of dirt and debris that blackens the sky. Turning the Nut into a tomb.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="盖尔的计划超出任何人的预料，比特说得没错，山体一旦崩塌，便无法控制。本来就不很坚固的山石，在遭到轰炸后，像泥石流一样迅速崩塌下来，“硬骨头”的整个一面山体在我们的眼前塌落，山上一切人类活动的痕迹瞬间荡然无存。我们呆呆地站在那里，惊得一句话也说不出来，感觉自己是多么渺小而微不足道。山石伴着巨大的响声轰然而下，成吨的碎石把出口堵塞，腾起的灰尘四处弥漫，把天空染成了黑色。“硬骨头”登时变成了一座坟墓。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Our hoverplanes are initially ignored by the commanders in the Nut, because in the past they've been little more trouble than flies buzzing around a honeypot. But after two rounds of bombings in the higher elevations of the mountain, the planes have their attention. By the time the Capitol's antiaircraft weapons begin to fire, it's already too late.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们的直升机开始并没有引起对方指挥官太多的注意，搁在平常，这些飞机不过是些在蜜罐子边嗡嗡的蜜蜂。但在飞机对山顶进行了两轮轰炸之后，终于引起了敌方的注意。到了凯匹特的防空作战武器开始发挥作用时，已经太晚了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I imagine the hell inside the mountain. Sirens wailing. Lights flickering into darkness. Stone dust choking the air. The shrieks of panicked, trapped beings stumbling madly for a way out, only to find the entrances, the launchpad, the ventilation shafts themselves clogged with earth and rock trying to force its way in. Live wires flung free, fires breaking out, rubble making a familiar path a maze. People slamming, shoving, scrambling like ants as the hill presses in, threatening to crush their fragile shells.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我能想象山洞内可怕的景象。警铃大作，洞内一片漆黑，空气里充满了呛人的灰尘，被困在里面的人们极度惊恐，一边尖叫着，一边疯狂地奔向出口，却发现出口、火箭发射口、通风口都已经被石块和土堵住，并且石块和土还在向内涌。电线垂落地上，引起熊熊大火，散落在地上的碎石堵塞了熟悉的通道，使人们找不到出路。当山体向内挤压，即将要压碎他们脆弱的躯体时，人们互相推搡、拥挤、像蚂蚁一样疯狂地四处奔逃。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On the day my father died, the sirens went off during my school lunch. No one waited for dismissal, or was expected to. The response to a mine accident was something outside the control of even the Capitol. I ran to Prim's class. I still remember her, tiny at seven, very pale, but sitting straight up with her hands folded on her desk. Waiting for me to collect her as I'd promised I would if the sirens ever sounded. She sprang out of her seat, grabbed my coat sleeve, and we wove through the streams of people pouring out onto the streets to pool at the main entrance of the mine. We found our mother clenching the rope that had been hastily strung to keep the crowd back. In retrospect, I guess I should have known there was a problem right then. Because why were we looking for her, when the reverse should have been true?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在父亲去世的那一天，学校正在开午饭，突然警铃大作。没人等着放学，或者需要等放学。老百姓对矿井事故的反应甚至凯匹特也无从控制。我跑到波丽姆的班级。我仍记得她当时的样子，那时她七岁，小小的个头，脸色苍白，但两手交叉放在桌子上，身体坐得笔直，正在等着我来接她。我们早就约好了如果警铃响了，我就来接她。她从座位上跳起来，抓住我的袖口。我们穿行在正拥向矿井出口的人流中。到了那里，我们看到妈妈正手抓着为阻挡人群拥入而临时拉起的绳索。现在回想起来，我当时就应该知道一定是出事了，因为在这样的时候，应该是妈妈去找我们，而不是我们找她呀？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The elevators were screeching, burning up and down their cables as they vomited smoke-blackened miners into the light of day. With each group came cries of relief, relatives diving under the rope to lead off their husbands, wives, children, parents, siblings. We stood in the freezing air as the afternoon turned overcast, a light snow dusted the earth. The elevators moved more slowly now and disgorged fewer beings. I knelt on the ground and pressed my hands into the cinders, wanting so badly to pull my father free. If there's a more helpless feeling than trying to reach someone you love who's trapped underground, I don't know it. The wounded. The bodies. The waiting through the night. Blankets put around your shoulders by strangers. A mug of something hot that you don't drink. And then finally, at dawn, the grieved expression on the face of the mine captain that could only mean one thing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罐笼吱吱嘎嘎地响着，不停地上上下下，把浑身漆黑的矿工从肚子里吐出来，吐到赤裸裸、惨白的阳光下。每上来一拨人，他们的亲人就发出了欣慰的哭泣声，就会从绳子底下钻过去，带走他们的丈夫、妻子、孩子、父母或兄弟姐妹。我们站在黄昏的寒风中，天上飘起了雪花。罐笼越走越慢，吐出来的人也越来越少。我跪在地上，手掌压在煤渣地上，我多么渴望能从这里把爸爸领回家呀。如果有哪种感情超越了对困在地下的爸爸的渴望，我并不知道，此时我是多么的无助和绝望。不断有受伤的人或者死者被拉上来，我们等了整整一夜。好心的陌生人给我们披上了毯子，端来了热汤，可我们没心思喝。最后，到了清晨，矿长脸上的悲哀表情只能说明一件事。">查看中文翻译</div>

Worn down by the Victory Tour, failing in my attempt to calm the districts, facing the memories of Clove and Cato, particularly Cato's gruesome, slow death by mutts.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我坐在大厅入口处的石柱旁，通过大门，我可以看到大理石地面向前延伸到台阶，台阶再往前走就是广场。我仍记得当我和皮塔在赢得饥饿游戏比赛后接受人们祝贺时的感觉，那是一种很不舒服的感觉。当时，我已被胜利巡演折腾得精疲力竭，又没能够平息各辖区的反叛情绪，而且时时被格拉芙和加图的死亡的记忆折磨着，特别是加图缓慢而悲惨的死亡。">查看中文翻译</div>

I have no stomach for it anyway, no heat in my blood. I wish Peeta was here -- the old Peeta -- because he would be able to articulate why it is so wrong to be exchanging fire when people, any people, are trying to claw their way out of the mountain. Or is my own history making me too sensitive? Aren't we at war? Isn't this just another way to kill our enemies?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="外面的枪声仍在继续，一些急于参加战斗的反抗者催促盖尔赶快行动。我没有请求加入战斗。不是他们不允许，而是我对战斗已经没有兴趣，我的血液里也失去了热情。我真希望皮塔就在这里——原来的皮塔——因为他会说明为什么当有人要从山里逃命时，与对方交火是不对的。也许是我的个人经历使我过于敏感了？外面不是在打仗吗？这不是为了消灭我们的敌人吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Night falls quickly. Huge, bright spotlights are turned on, illuminating the square. Every bulb must be burning at full wattage inside the train station as well. Even from my position across the square, I can see clearly through the plate-glass front of the long, narrow building. It would be impossible to miss the arrival of a train, or even a single person. But hours pass and no one comes. With each minute, it becomes harder to imagine that anyone survived the assault on the Nut.</div>

I experience my own confusion as I realize what I've said is entirely true, and the noble impulse that carried me across the square is replaced by despair. "I can't. That's the problem, isn't it?" I lower my bow. "We blew up your mine. You burned my district to the ground. We've got every reason to kill each other. So do it. Make the Capitol happy. I'm done killing their slaves for them." I drop my bow on the ground and give it a nudge with my boot. It slides across the stone and comes to rest at his knees.</div>
