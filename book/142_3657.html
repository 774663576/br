<div class="line_en">In the New Hampshire village, every foreign phenomenon was properly noticed by housewives peering from windows, storekeepers lounging behind their doors. And so when the black automobile bearing New York license plates stopped in front of the Adams' home, every citizen knew about it in a matter of minutes.</div>

<div class="line_en">Kay Adams, really a small-town girl despite her college education, was also peering from her bedroom window. She had been studying for her exams and preparing to go downstairs for lunch when she spotted the car coming up the street, and for some reason she was not surprised when it rolled to a halt in front of her lawn. Two men got out, big burly men who looked like gangsters in the movies to her eyes, and she flew down the stairs to be the first at the door. She was sure they came from Michael or his family and she didn't want them talking to her father and mother without any introduction. It wasn't that she was ashamed of any of Mike's friends, she thought; it was just that her mother and father were old-fashioned New England Yankees and wouldn't understand her even knowing such people.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="恺·亚当斯姆尽管上过大学，但还有小村镇的姑娘的习气，她也从卧室窗口朝外凝视。她近年来一直在刻苦学习，准备考试。她刚刚打算下楼吃午饭，恰恰在这时瞅见那辆汽车从街道那边开了过来。当汽车突然停在她家草坪前面的时候，不知什么缘故，她并不感到奇怪。车上下来了两个男人，又高又大又粗壮，在她看来就像电影里的坏蛋。她断定那两个人是迈克尔或他家里派来的。她不愿意他们两人在未经介绍之前就同她父母谈话。她心里想，这倒并非因为她对迈克尔的朋友感到害臊，而是因为她父母都是古板的新英格兰人，甚至对她怎么会认识这种人也不会理解。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Kay laughed. Her laughter was so unaffected, so incredulous, that the officers were impressed. "Mike wouldn't do anything like that," she said. "He never had anything to do with his family. When we went to his sister's wedding it was obvious that he was treated as an outsider, almost as much as I was. If he's hiding now it's just so that he won't get any publicity, so his name won't be dragged through all this. Mike is not a gangster. I know him better than you or anybody else can know him. He is too nice a man to do anything as despicable as murder. He is the most law-abiding person I know, and I've never known him to lie."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="恺放声大笑。她笑得那么自然，表现得那么不相信迈克尔杀人的事。这两个警察也得到了很深刻的印象。“迈克尔不会干这种事，”她说，“他同他的家庭根本没有任何牵连。我同他一道参加过他妹妹的婚礼，我看得很清楚：他被当做外人看待，简直同我一样地被当作客人。假使他躲起来了，那是因为他不想让自己的名字给扯进这种纠纷里去。迈克不是强盗。我比你更了解他，任何人也不可能比我更了解他。他这人太光明磊落了，根本不可能去干谋杀这类可鄙的事。他是我所认识的最奉公守法的一个人，而且据我所知，他从来都没有撒过谎。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="侦探费力普斯又温和地问：“你认识他有好久了？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I think there are a few things you should know," Detective Phillips said. "On the night he left you, he went to the hospital. When he came out he got into an argument with a police captain who had come to the hospital on official business. He assaulted that police officer but got the worst of it. In fact he got a broken jaw and lost some teeth. His friends took him out to the Corleone Family houses at Long Beach. The following night the police captain he had the fight with was gunned down and Michael Corleone disappeared. Vanished. We have our contacts, our informers. They all point the finger at Michael Corleone but we have no evidence for a court of law. The waiter who witnessed the shooting doesn't recognize a picture of Mike but he may recognize him in person. And we have Sollozzo's driver, who refuses to talk, but we might make him talk if we have Michael Corleone in our hands. So we have all our people looking for him, the FBI is looking for him, everybody is looking for him. So far, no luck, so we thought you might be able to give us a lead."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我想有些事情得让你知道一下，”侦探费力普斯说，“那天晚上他离开你之后就到医院去了，他刚从医院里出来，就与一个警官发生争执。他先动手想打那个警官，但却没有占到便宜。实际上他的牙床给打坏了，有几颗牙也给打落了，他的朋友把他送回了长摊镇考利昂家。第二天晚上与他发生殴打的那个上尉警官就被枪杀了，而同时迈克尔·考利昂就失踪了，销声匿迹了。我们有通消息的人，也有告密的人。他们都认定凶手就是迈克尔·考利昂。但是我们向法院提不出证据，饭店堂倌是现场见证人，他看了迈克尔的照片却说不认识，但见了人就可能认识。还有索洛佐的司机，他拒不开口。但是如果我们把迈克尔·考利昂抓到手，我们就能想办法叫他开口，因此，我们全体都出来找他，联邦调查局也在找他，我们大家都在找他。直到现在还没有结果。我们觉得，也许你能够向我们提供一些线索。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Kay shook her head. The other detective, Siriani, said roughly, "We know you two have been shacking up together. We have the hotel records and witnesses. If we let that information slip to the newspapers your father and mother would feel pretty lousy. Real respectable people like them wouldn't think much of a daughter shacking up with a gangster. If you don't come clean right now I'll call your old man in here and give it to him straight."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="恺摇摇头。另一个侦探粗暴地说：“我们知道你同他一直在一起过夜。我们掌握了旅馆登记和见证人，要是把这种事情捅到报纸上去，你父母是会很不愉快的。像他那样真正高尚的人，对于一个经常同流氓过夜的女儿是会有看法的。如果你不马上坦白，我就要把你老子喊来，把这些情况直截了当地告诉他。”">查看中文翻译</div>
