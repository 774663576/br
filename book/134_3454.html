<div class="line_en">Therese came back upstairs for the box. It had come an hour ago by messenger -- a lot of sandwiches in wax paper, a bottle of blackberry wine, a cake, and a box containing the white dress Mrs. Semco had promised her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特芮丝又上楼去拿箱子。那个箱子是一小时前信差带过来的，里面有好多包覆在蜡纸里面的三明治、一瓶黑莓酒、一块蛋糕，还有一个盒子，装着桑姆科太太答应做给她的白色连衣裙。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">An unwanted dress still lay on the couch, a corner of the rug was turned back, but Therese was impatient to be off. She pulled the door shut, and hurried down the steps with the box, past the Kellys' who were both away at work, past Mrs. Osborne's door. She had said good-by to Mrs. Osborne an hour ago when she had paid the next month's rent.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was Phil McElroy, calling her to ask about the interview with Harkevy yesterday. She had told Dannie about it last night when they had had dinner together. Harkevy hadn't promised her a job, but he had said to keep in touch, and Therese felt he meant it. He had let her come to see him backstage in the theater where he was supervising the set for Winter Town. He had chosen three of her cardboard models and looked very carefully at them, dismissed one as a little dull, pointed out some impracticality in the second, and liked best the hall-like set Therese had started the evening she had come back from the first visit to Carol's house. He was the first person who had ever given her less conventional sets a serious consideration. She had called Carol up immediately and told her about the meeting. She told Phil about the Harkevy interview, but she didn't mention that the Andronich job had fallen through. She knew it was because she didn't want Richard to hear about it. Therese asked Phil to let her know what play Harkevy was doing sets for next, because he said he hadn't decided himself between two plays. There was more of a chance he would take her on as apprentice, if he chose the English play he had talked about yesterday.</div>

<div class="line_en">They fixed dinner themselves, because Florence had already started her three weeks' leave. They opened some special jars of things that Carol said she had been saving, and they made stingers in the cocktail shaker just before dinner. Therese thought Carol's mood had passed, but when she started to pour a second stinger for herself, Carol said shortly, "I don't think you should have any more of that."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佛罗伦斯已经开始休假——三个礼拜，所以今晚她们自己做了晚餐，打开了一些奇怪的罐头，卡罗尔说这些罐头已经储存好一阵子了。晚餐前两人还调了鸡尾酒，特芮丝觉得卡罗尔的情绪已经平复下来了，可是等她替自己倒第二杯鸡尾酒的时候，卡罗尔又立刻说：“我觉得你不应该再喝酒了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was Harge still, Therese thought. Therese hesitated a minute, then went upstairs. She untied the waist and the sleeves, glanced at herself in the mirror, then tied them all back again. If Carol wanted her to keep it on, she would.</div>

<div class="line_en">And Therese deferred, with a smile. And the mood went on. Nothing Therese said or did could change it, and Therese blamed the inhibiting dress for not being able to think of the right things to say. They took brandied chestnuts and coffee up to the porch after dinner, but they said even less to each other in the semidarkness, and Therese only felt sleepy and rather depressed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特芮丝带着笑容听从了，卡罗尔的怪情绪还是继续着，不管特芮丝怎么说或怎么做，都没有改变。特芮丝则把责任推到那件使人无法开口的连衣裙上，穿上这件连衣裙之后，好像就无法说出适当的话。晚餐后，她们把酒渍的栗子和咖啡带到楼上阳台，可是在半昏暗的灯光下，两人交谈的机会甚至更少，特芮丝只感觉到睡意，而且情绪非常低落。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Richard just left the house," Mrs. Semco said. "He's going to be awfully lonely. He mopes around already." But she laughed, her vigorous, high-pitched laugh that filled the kitchen where Therese knew she stood, a laugh that would ring through the house, even to Richard's empty room upstairs.

<div class="line_en">Therese let a crack of air in at her window. It was quite cold and the heater felt good on her ankles. The clock on the dashboard said quarter to ten, and she thought suddenly of the people working in Frankenberg's, penned in there at a quarter of ten in the morning, this morning and tomorrow morning and the next, the hands of clocks controlling every move they made. But the hands of the clock on the dashboard meant nothing now to her and Carol. They would sleep or not sleep, drive or not drive, whenever it pleased them. She thought of Mrs. Robichek, selling sweaters this minute on the third floor, commencing another year there, her fifth year.</div>
