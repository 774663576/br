<div class="line_en">The Grotta Bianca was a long cave that ended in a mass of boulders that reached to the ceiling, or almost. When they were little boys Turi and Aspanu had managed to squeeze over those boulders and discover a passage that ran right through to the other side of the mountain. It had existed before Christ, dug by the army of Spartacus, hiding from Roman legions.</div>

<div class="line_en">The morning after their escape from Montelepre, Turi Guiliano and Aspanu Pisciotta bathed in a swift-running stream behind their cave on Monte d'Ora. They took their guns to the edge of the cliff and spread out a blanket to enjoy the pink-streaked dawn.</div>

<div class="line_en">Far below, tiny as a toy village, lay Montelepre. The many paths that led to their cliff were thin chalky worms which clung to the sides of the mountains. One by one the gray stone houses of Montelepre were turned to gold by the rising sun.</div>

<div class="line_en">The morning air was clear, the prickly pears on the ground were cool and sweet and Turi picked one up and bit into it carefully to freshen his mouth. In a few hours the heat of the sun would turn them into juiceless cottony balls. Gecko lizards, with huge balloonlike heads on tiny insect legs, crawled over his hand, but they were harmless despite their obscenely frightening appearance. He flicked them aside.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="早晨的空气非常清新。地上的仙人果清凉甘甜，图里随手摘了一个，慢慢地放进嘴里咬了一口，可以清除口腔中的异味。再过几个小时，火热的太阳就将把它们变成棉桃似的干果。长着昆虫般细腿和圆鼓鼓大脑袋的壁虎爬到他手上。它们虽然样子可怕，但是却不伤人。他把它们轻轻地掸开了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">While Aspanu cleaned the guns, Turi watched the town below. His naked eye picked out tiny black dots, people going into the countryside to work their little pieces of land. He tried to locate his own house. Long ago he and Aspanu had flown the flags of Sicily and America from that roof. Gleefully cunning children, they had accepted praise as patriots, but the real reason was to keep the house under observation while they roamed the tops of the nearby mountains -- a reassuring link to the adult world.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿斯帕努在擦枪，图里注视着下面的小镇。目力所及处，他看见一些小黑点。那是人们走出小镇到自己的小块土地上去劳作。他想找到自己家的房子。很久以前他和阿斯帕努曾经在自家的屋顶插上西西里和美国的旗帜。这两个聪明活泼的孩子被人们称赞为爱国者，他们没有吭气，其实真正原因是：当他们在附近山头玩耍的时候，一眼就能看见这幢房子——确保与成人世界的联系。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Guiliano said to Pisciotta, "Keep an eye on those trails," and went into the cave. Even after ten years, Guiliano remembered exactly where they had buried the flags, in the right-hand corner where the boulders met the earth. They had dug in the dirt underneath the boulder, then packed the earth back over it.</div>

<div class="line_en">Suddenly he remembered something that had happened ten years ago. The Fascist officials of the village had ordered them to take down the American flag from the Guiliano roof. The two boys had been so enraged that they had taken down both flags, the American and the Sicilian. Then they had taken the flags to their secret hideout, the Grotta Bianca, and buried the flags near the wall of boulders.</div>

<div class="line_en">A mat of thin, slimy, green-black moss had grown over the spot. Guiliano dug into it with his boot and then used a small stone as a pick. In a matter of minutes the flags were uncovered. The American flag was a slimy mess of rags, but they had wrapped the Sicilian flag inside the American one, and the shielded one had survived. Guiliano flipped it open, the scarlet and gold colors as bold as when he was a child. There was not even a hole in it. He brought it outside and said to Pisciotta, laughing, "Do you remember this, Aspanu?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那个地方已经长出一层薄薄的暗绿色青苔。吉里安诺用皮靴在地上踢了踢，然后用一块小石头在地上挖起来。没用几分钟时间，他就把那两面旗挖了出来。美国旗已经成了一块破布，裹在它里面的西西里旗则保存得比较好。吉里安诺把旗子展开，鲜红和金黄色还像他小时候看到的一样鲜艳，而且上面一个洞眼都没有。他把它取出来，笑着对皮肖塔说：“你还记得这个吗，阿斯帕努？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Pisciotta stared at the flag. Then he too laughed, but in a more excited way. "It's fate," he shouted and jumped up and snatched the flag from Guiliano's hand. He went to the cliff's edge and waved it at the town below. They did not even have to speak to each other. Guiliano tore off a sapling that grew on the cliff face. They dug a hole and propped the sapling up with stones, then attached the flag to the sapling so that it flew free for all the world to see. Finally, they sat on the cliff edge to wait.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮肖塔惊讶地看着这面旗，接着也笑起来，不过显得更加激动。“这是命运，”他大喊一声，从地上跳起来，把那面旗从吉里安诺手里夺了过去。他拿着旗子走到悬崖边，朝着下面的小镇挥舞。此刻他俩是心照不宣。吉里安诺从悬崖边上拔起一棵小树。他们在地上挖了一个小洞，把小树放进去，用石头把树支撑起来，然后把那面旗帜挂在上面，让所有的人看见它在自由地飘扬。最后，他们坐在悬崖边等待着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Guiliano recognized the contempt in Pisciotta's voice. Pisciotta -- so slender, so dapper, so well formed -- had a horror of physical deformity. His tubercular lungs, which sometimes bloodied his mouth, disgusted him, not because of the danger to his life, but because it marred what he thought of as his beauty. Sicilians have a fondness for giving people nicknames related to their physical failings or abnormalities, and once a friend had called Pisciotta "Paper Lungs." Pisciotta had tried to stab him with his pocketknife. Only Guiliano's strength had prevented murder.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉里安诺听出了皮肖塔话音中的鄙弃。皮肖塔这个人身材瘦削、精干、体态匀称，但对生理缺陷有一种恐惧心理。他患有肺结核，有时候还咳血，他觉得很恶心，倒不是因为这会危及生命，而是因为这会破坏他的完美形象。西西里人喜欢根据一个人的生理缺陷给人起绰号。有一次皮肖塔的一个朋友戏称他“纸肺”，皮肖塔操起小刀就要捅他，要不是吉里安诺有力气，差点就要弄出人命来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was midday before they saw anything and then it was just a lone man riding a donkey on the dusty path that led to their cliff. They watched for another hour and then as the donkey entered the mountain range and took the upward path, Pisciotta said, "Damn, that rider is smaller than his donkey. It must be your godfather, Adonis."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到中午时分，他们才看见通向他们那段峭壁的土路上出现了一个骑着毛驴的人。持续观察了一个小时后，他们才看见那只驴子上了山脊，沿着上山的路走来。皮肖塔说：“真见鬼，骑驴的人比驴还小。肯定是你的教父阿多尼斯。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Guiliano ran down the mountainside for a few miles and hid behind a huge granite rock. It was one of his childhood games with Aspanu.

<div class="line_en">Guiliano called, "Godfather, it's Turi," and waited until Adonis put his gun back into his waistband and shrugged out of his knapsack. Then Guiliano lowered his lupara and stepped into the open. Guiliano knew that Hector Adonis always had trouble dismounting because of his short legs and he wanted to help him. But when he appeared on the path the Professor slid down quickly, and they embraced. They walked up to the cliff, Guiliano leading the donkey.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉里安诺大声说：“教父，我是图里。”等阿多尼斯把枪插回腰间的皮带上，卸下身上的背包后，吉里安诺才把短筒猎枪的枪口放低，从岩石后面走出来。他知道赫克特·阿多尼斯腿短，从牲口背上下来比较困难，想上前帮他一把。可是当他走上那条小道的时候，教授已经很敏捷地从毛驴背上下来了。他们相互拥抱，吉里安诺牵着驴子，两人一起向上，朝峭壁方向走去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, young man, you've burned your bridges," Hector Adonis said in his professional voice. "Two more dead policemen after last night. It's no longer a joke."</div>

To let you bring me packages of food while I take a vacation in the mountains? They come to kill me, and so I'll kill them. And you, my dear godfather. When I was a child, didn't you lecture me on the miserable life of the Sicilian peasant? How oppressed they are, by Rome and its tax collectors, by the nobility, by rich landowners who pay for our labor with lire that can barely keep us alive? I went to the marketplace with two hundred other men of Montelepre and they bid for us as if we were cattle. A hundred lire for a morning's work they said, take it or leave it. And most of the men had to take it. Who then will be the champion of Sicily, if not Salvatore Guiliano?"</div>

Would his godfather think him insanely proud? But he went on. "I am not afraid of dying." He smiled at Hector Adonis, the boyish smile Adonis knew so well and loved. "Really, I'm astonished by it myself. But I'm not afraid of being killed. It doesn't seem possible to me." He laughed aloud. "Their field police, their armored cars, their machine guns, all of Rome.

<div class="line_en">Hector Adonis studied both of the young men as he pondered his answer. He could easily promise to help and forget his promise. He could just as easily refuse and promise only to give the aid a friend would give from time to time, as he was doing today. After all, the comedy might be short. Guiliano might be killed fighting or betrayed. He might emigrate to America. And the problem would be solved, he thought sadly.</div>

One of them was the Song of Roland, and he had read it to them.</div>

<div class="line_en">Adonis knew the poem almost by heart. It was dear to every literate Sicilian, and its story was beloved by the illiterate. It was the mainstay of the puppet theater that played every town and village, and its legendary characters were painted on the side of every wagon that rolled along the Sicilian hills. Emperor Charlemagne's two great knights, Roland and Oliver, slaughtered the Saracens, protecting their Emperor's retreat into France. Adonis told how they had died together in the great battle of Roncevalles -- how Oliver begged three times for Roland to blow his horn to bring back Charlemagne's army and how Roland refused out of pride. And then when the Saracens overwhelmed them, Roland blew his great horn, but it was too late. When Charlemagne returned to rescue his knights, he found their bodies among the thousands of dead Saracens and rent his beard. Adonis remembered the tears in Turi Guiliano's eyes and, oddly enough, the look of scorn on the face of Aspanu Pisciotta. To one it was the greatest moment a man could live, to the other child it was a humiliating death at the hands of the infidel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这首诗阿多尼斯几乎能背下来。在西西里，每个识字的人都喜爱这首诗，每个不识字的也都喜欢这个故事。在小镇和乡村演出的木偶剧团都把它作为主打节目，西西里的每辆马车上都画着这个传奇故事中的人物。查理大帝有两个伟大的骑士罗兰和奥利维，他们杀死了大批萨拉森人，保护他从法兰克撤离。阿多尼斯讲述了他们在伟大的龙塞斯瓦列斯战役中是如何共同战死的——奥利维三次请求罗兰吹响号角，让查理大帝的军队回兵营救，而骄傲的罗兰拒绝了。等萨拉森人在数量上占压倒优势的时候，罗兰吹响了大号，但为时已晚。查理大帝杀回来营救他的爱将，发现他们已经战死，他们的四周躺满了萨拉森人的尸体，他难过得直扯自己的胡须。阿多尼斯记得吉里安诺激动得热泪盈眶，但奇怪的是，阿斯帕努的脸上却露出了不屑的神情。这两个孩子中，一个认为这是人生中最壮烈的时刻，另一个却认为死在异教徒手中很不光彩。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The two young boys had gotten up from the grass to run into the house for supper. Turi threw his arms across Aspanu's shoulder, and Hector had smiled at the gesture. It was Roland holding Oliver erect so that they could both die on their feet before the charging Saracens. Roland, dying, had reached out his gauntlet to the azure sky, and an angel had plucked it from his hand. Or so the poem and legend said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当时两个孩子从草地上爬起来，跑进屋里去吃晚饭。图里的一只手臂搂着阿斯帕努的肩膀，阿多尼斯看见这个姿势后微微一笑。这是罗兰扶着奥利维，这样他们两人才能在冲上来的萨拉森人面前站着死。罗兰临死的时候把他的铁护手指向蓝天，一个天使把它从他的手里接了过去。那首诗以及那个传奇故事都是这么说的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That was a thousand years ago, but Sicily still suffered in the same brutal landscape of olive groves and scorching plains, of roadside shrines built by the first followers of Christ, the countless crosses holding the crucified rebellious slaves led by Spartacus.

<div class="line_en">As Adonis watched them now, Pisciotta lounging on his back in the grass, Guiliano staring at him with dark brown eyes and with a smile that seemed to say he knew exactly what his godfather was thinking, a curious transformation of the scene took place. Adonis saw them as statues carved in marble, their bodies wrenched out of ordinary life. Pisciotta became a figure on a vase, the gecko in his hand an adder, all finely etched in the morning sunlight of the mountains. Pisciotta looked dangerous, a man who filled the world with poison and daggers.</div>

<div class="line_en">Salvatore Guiliano, his godson Turi, was the other side of the vase. His had the beauty of some Greek Apollo, the features fully molded flesh, the eyes with whites so clear they gave almost the impression of blindness. His face was open and frank with the innocence of a legendary hero. Or rather, thought Adonis, rejecting his sentimentality, the resolution of a young man determined to be heroic. His body had the muscular fleshiness of those Mediterranean statues, the heavy thighs, the muscular back. His body was American, taller and broader than most Sicilians'.</div>
