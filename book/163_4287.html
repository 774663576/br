<div class="line_en">"Wang Miao?" The way the cop addressed him by name only, so direct and impolite, made Wang uncomfortable. Adding to the insult, the man lit a cigarette as he addressed him, without even lifting his head to show his face. Before Wang could answer, the man nodded at the younger cop, who showed Wang his badge. Having lit the cigarette, the older cop moved to enter Wang's apartment.</div>

<div class="line_en">As soon as Wang saw the cops, he felt annoyed. The younger one was all right -- at least he was polite. But the other one, in plainclothes, immediately grated on him. He was thickset and had a face full of bulging muscles. Wearing a dirty leather jacket, smelling of cigarettes, and speaking in a loud voice, he was exactly the sort of person Wang despised.</div>

<div class="line_en">The meeting table, formed by pushing several smaller tables together, was piled with documents and odds and ends. The attendees, their clothes wrinkled, looked exhausted. Those wearing ties had all pulled them loose. It seemed as if they had been up all night.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="临时拼凑的会议桌上也是堆满了文件和杂物，与会者大多神情疲惫，衣服皱巴巴的，有领带的都扯开了，好像熬了一夜。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Wang was surprised by the chaos as he entered the large meeting room. Around him were numerous computers in various states of disarray. They had run out of table space and put a few workstations directly on the floor, where power cords and networking wires formed a tangled mess. Instead of being installed in racks, a bunch of routers were left haphazardly on top of the servers. Printer paper was scattered everywhere. A few projector screens stood in various corners of the room, sticking out at odd angles like gypsy tents. A cloud of smoke hovered over the room… Wang Miao wasn't sure if this was the Battle Command Center, but he was sure of one thing: Whatever they were dealing with was too important for them to care about keeping up appearances.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="会议是在一个大厅里举行的，汪淼一进去就对这里的纷乱吃惊不小。大厅周围是一圈胡乱安放的电脑设备，有的桌子上放不下就直接搁地板上，电线和网线纠缠着散在地上；一大摞网络交换机没有安在机架内，而是随手堆放在服务器上；有好几个投影仪的大屏幕，在大厅的角落里呈不同角度随意立着，像吉普赛人的帐篷；烟雾像晨雾般在半空浮了一层……汪淼不知道这是否就是那名军官所说的作战中心，有一点他可以肯定：这里在处理的事情，已经让人们顾不上其他了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A major general named Chang Weisi presided over the meeting, and half the attendees were military officers. After a few quick introductions, Wang found out that many of the others were police. The rest were academics like him, with a few prominent scientists specializing in basic research in the mix.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="主持会议的是一位叫常伟思的陆军少将，与会者有一半是军人。经过简单的介绍，他知道还有少部分警方人员，其他的人都是和他一样参加会议的专家学者，其中有几位还是很有名望的科学家，而且是研究基础科学的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The unusual term "combat zone" gave Wang pause. He also noticed that the general did not seem to want to explain in detail the background of what they were dealing with to new people like him. This supported Shi's point.

The general had neglected to add "gentlemen."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“战区”这个不寻常的术语令汪淼迷惑，他还注意到，首长好像并没有打算向他这样的新人介绍来龙去脉，这倒是印证了史强的话。在常将军这简短的开场白中，他两次提到了 “同志们”，汪淼看看对面的两名北约军人和两个美国中情局官员，感觉将军似乎漏掉了“先生们”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Shi looked around but couldn't find an ashtray. In the end, he dropped the cigarette into a teacup. He raised his hand, and before Chang could even acknowledge him, he spoke loudly. "General, I have a request which I've made before: I want information parity."</div>

<div class="line_en">Ding nodded. "I have no direct connection with the Frontiers of Science, but it is famous in academia. Its core goal is a response to the following: Since the second half of the twentieth century, physics has gradually lost the concision and simplicity of its classical theories. Modern theoretical models have become more and more complex, vague, and uncertain. Experimental verification has become more difficult as well. This is a sign that the forefront of physics research seems to be hitting a wall. "Members of the Frontiers of Science want to attempt a new way of thinking. To put it simply, they want to use the methods of science to discover the limits of science, to try to find out if there is a limit to how deeply and precisely science can know nature -- a boundary beyond which science cannot go. The development of modern physics seems to suggest that such a line has been touched."</div>

If you won't agree, we understand."</div>
