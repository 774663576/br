<div class="line_en">It happened on a bright, sunny day in early spring. All through the winter Robin and his men had had a very boring time. Nearly all their fun and adventures happened with people travelling through the forest. As there were no trains, people had to travel on horseback. In winter the roads were so bad, and the weather so cold and wet, that most people stayed at home. So it was rather a quiet time for Robin and his men. They lived in great caves during the winter, and spent their time making bows and arrows, and mending their boots and clothes.</div>

<div class="line_en">Robin Hood was captain of the band of Merry Men. Next to him came Little John. It might seem strange to you. He was called Little John because he was so tall.</div>

<div class="line_en">When Robin first came to live in Sherwood Forest he was rather sad, for he could not at once forget all he had lost. But he was not long lonely. When it became known that he had gone to live in the Green Wood, other poor men, who had been driven out of their homes by the Normans, joined him. They soon formed a band and were known as the "Merry Men."</div>

<div class="line_en">Robin was no longer Robin of Huntingdon, but Robin of Sherwood Forest. Very soon people shortened Sherwood into Hood. People almost forgot that he was really an earl, and he had become known, not only all over England, but in many far countries, as Robin Hood.</div>
