<div class="line_en">A long time passed, and people said to each other --"I wonder if there is a church out in the wood? The bell has a tone that is wondrous sweet; let us stroll thither, and examine the matter nearer." And the rich people drove out, and the poor walked, but the way seemed strangely long to them; and when they came to a clump of willows which grew on the skirts of the forest, they sat down, and looked up at the long branches, and fancied they were now in the depth of the green wood. The confectioner of the town came out, and set up his booth there; and soon after came another confectioner, who hung a bell over his stand, as a sign or ornament, but it had no clapper, and it was tarred over to preserve it from the rain. When all the people returned home, they said it had been very romantic, and that it was quite a different sort of thing to a pic-nic or tea-party. There were three persons who asserted they had penetrated to the end of the forest, and that they had always heard the wonderful sounds of the bell, but it had seemed to them as if it had come from the town. One wrote a whole poem about it, and said the bell sounded like the voice of a mother to a good dear child, and that no melody was sweeter than the tones of the bell. The king of the country was also observant of it, and vowed that he who could discover whence the sounds proceeded, should have the title of "Universal Bell-ringer," even if it were not really a bell.</div>

<div class="line_en">People said "The Evening Bell is sounding, the sun is setting." For a strange wondrous tone was heard in the narrow streets of a large town. It was like the sound of a church-bell: but it was only heard for a moment, for the rolling of the carriages and the voices of the multitude made too great a noise.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“暮钟响起来了！”人们说，“太阳落下去了！”城外的房子彼此之间的距离比较远，而且都有花园和草坪；因此城外的人就可以看出天还是很亮的，所以也能更清楚地听到这个钟声。它似乎是从一个藏在静寂而清香的森林里的教堂里发出来的。大家朝这声音飘来的方向望，不禁起了一种庄严的感觉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Those persons who were walking outside the town, where the houses were farther apart, with gardens or little fields between them, could see the evening sky still better, and heard the sound of the bell much more distinctly. It was as if the tones came from a church in the still forest; people looked thitherward, and felt their minds attuned most solemnly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黄昏的时候，太阳正在下沉，烟囱上飘着的云块泛出一片金黄的光彩；这时在一个大城市的小巷里，一忽儿这个人，一忽儿那个人全都听到类似教堂钟声的奇异声音。不过声音每次持续的时间非常短。因为街上隆隆的车声和嘈杂的人声总是把它打断了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was the day of confirmation. The clergyman had spoken so touchingly, the children who were confirmed had been greatly moved; it was an eventful day for them; from children they become all at once grown-up-persons; it was as if their infant souls were now to fly all at once into persons with more understanding. The sun was shining gloriously; the children that had been confirmed went out of the town; and from the wood was borne towards them the sounds of the unknown bell with wonderful distinctness. They all immediately felt a wish to go thither; all except three. One of them had to go home to try on a ball-dress; for it was just the dress and the ball which had caused her to be confirmed this time, for otherwise she would not have come; the other was a poor boy, who had borrowed his coat and boots to be confirmed in from the innkeeper's son, and he was to give them back by a certain hour; the third said that he never went to a strange place if his parents were not with him-that he had always been a good boy hitherto, and would still be so now that he was confirmed, and that one ought not to laugh at him for it: the others, however, did make fun of him, after all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在举行坚信礼的那一天，牧师发表了一篇漂亮而动人的演说。受坚信礼的孩子们都受到了极大的感动，因为这是他们生命中极重要的一天。他们在这一天从孩子变成了成年人。他们稚气的灵魂也要变成更有理智的成年人的灵魂。当这些受了坚信礼的人走出城外的时候，处处照着灿烂的太阳光，树林里那个神秘的大钟发出非常洪亮的声音。他们想立刻就去找这个钟声；因此他们全都去了，只有三个人是例外。一个要回家去试试她的参加舞会的礼服，因为她这次来受坚信礼完全是为了这件礼服和舞会，否则她就决不会来的。第二个是一个穷苦的孩子。他受坚信礼穿的衣服和靴子是从主人的少爷那儿借来的；他必须在指定的时间内归还。第三个说，在他没有得到父母的同意以前，决不到一个陌生的地方去。他一直是一个听话的孩子，即使受了坚信礼，仍然是如此。人们不应该笑他！——但是人们却仍然笑他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Many persons now went to the wood, for the sake of getting the place, but one only returned with a sort of explanation; for nobody went far enough, that one not further than the others. However, he said that the sound proceeded from a very large owl, in a hollow tree; a sort of learned owl, that continually knocked its head against the branches. But whether the sound came from his head or from the hollow tree, that no one could say with certainty. So now he got the place of "Universal Bellringer," and wrote yearly a short treatise "On the Owl"; but everybody was just as wise as before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这么一来，许多人为了饭碗问题，就到树林里去寻找钟。不过在回来的人当中只有一个人能说出一点道理，谁也没有深入树林，这人当然也没有，可是他却说声音是住在一株空树里的大猫头鹰发出来的。这只猫头鹰的脑袋里装的全是智慧。它不停地把脑袋撞着树。不过这声音是从它的脑袋里发出来的呢，还是从空树干里发出来的呢，他可没有把握下个判断。他总算得到了“世界的敲钟人”这个职位，因此他每年写一篇关于猫头鹰的短论。不过大家并没有因为读了他的论文而变得比以前更聪明。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There were three, therefore, that did not go; the others hastened on. The sun shone, the birds sang, and the children sang too, and each held the other by the hand; for as yet they had none of them any high office, and were all of equal rank in the eye of God.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因此这三个人就不去了。别的人都连蹦带跳地走了。太阳在照耀着，鸟儿在唱着，这些刚刚受了坚信礼的人也在唱着。他们彼此手挽着手，因为他们还没得到什么不同的职位，而且在受坚信礼的这天大家在我们的上帝面前都是平等的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But two of the youngest soon grew tired, and both returned to town; two little girls sat down, and twined garlands, so they did not go either; and when the others reached the willow-tree, where the confectioner was, they said, "Now we are there! In reality the bell does not exist; it is only a fancy that people have taken into their heads!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过他们之中有两个最小的孩子马上就感到腻烦了，所以他们两个人就回到城里去了。另外还有两个小女孩子坐下来扎花环，也不愿意去。当其余的孩子走到那个卖糕饼的人所在的柳树林里的时候，他们说：“好，我们算是到了。钟连影子都没有，这完全是一个幻想！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At the same moment the bell sounded deep in the wood, so clear and solemnly that five or six determined to penetrate somewhat further. It was so thick, and the foliage so dense, that it was quite fatiguing to proceed. Woodroof and anemonies grew almost too high; blooming convolvuluses and blackberry-bushes hung in long garlands from tree to tree, where the nightingale sang and the sunbeams were playing: it was very beautiful, but it was no place for girls to go; their clothes would get so torn. Large blocks of stone lay there, overgrown with moss of every color; the fresh spring bubbled forth, and made a strange gurgling sound.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正在这时候，一个柔和而庄严的钟声在树林的深处响起来；有四五个孩子决计再向树林里走去。树很密，叶子又多，要向前走真是不太容易。车叶草和秋牡丹长得非常高，盛开的旋花和黑莓像长花环似的从这棵树牵到那棵树。夜莺在这些树上唱歌，太阳光在这些树上嬉戏。啊，这地方真是美丽得很，不过这条路却不是女孩子可以走的，因为她们在这儿很容易撕破自己的衣服，这儿有长满各色青苔的石块，有潺潺流着的新鲜泉水，发出一种“骨碌，骨碌”的怪声音。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They now let him go on alone; and as he went, his breast was filled more and more with the forest solitude; but he still heard the little bell with which the others were so satisfied, and now and then, when the wind blew, he could also hear the people singing who were sitting at tea where the confectioner had his tent; but the deep sound of the bell rose louder; it was almost as if an organ were accompanying it, and the tones came from the left hand, the side where the heart is placed. A rustling was heard in the bushes, and a little boy stood before the King's Son, a boy in wooden shoes, and with so short a jacket that one could see what long wrists he had. Both knew each other: the boy was that one among the children who could not come because he had to go home and return his jacket and boots to the innkeeper's son. This he had done, and was now going on in wooden shoes and in his humble dress, for the bell sounded with so deep a tone, and with such strange power, that proceed he must.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这样，大家就让他一个人向前走。他越向前走，他的心里就越充满了一种森林中特有的静寂之感。不过他仍听见大家所欣赏的那阵小小的钟声。有时风把那个糕饼店里的声音吹来，于是他就听到大家在一面吃茶，一面唱歌。不过洪亮的钟声比这些声音还要大，好像有风琴在伴奏似的。这声音是从左边来的——从心所在的那一边来的。有一个沙沙的响声从一个灌木丛中飘出来。王子面前出现了一个男孩子。这孩子穿着一双木鞋和一件非常短的上衣——短得连他的手肘也盖不住。他们彼此都认识，因为这个孩子也是在这天参加过坚信礼的。他没有能跟大家一起来，因为他得回去把衣服和靴子还给老板的少爷。他办完了这件事以后，就穿着木鞋和寒碜的上衣独自一人走来，因为钟声是那么洪亮和深沉，他非来不可。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Was it that which people had heard? Yes, everybody was unanimous on the subject, except one, who said that the bell was too small and too fine to be heard at so great a distance, and besides it was very different tones to those that could move a human heart in such a manner. It was a king's son who spoke; whereon the others said, "Such people always want to be wiser than everybody else."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="难道大家听到的钟声就是从这里发出来的吗？是的，他们都有这种看法，只有一个人是例外。这人说，这口钟太小，太精致，决不会叫他们在很远的地方就听得见！此外，他们听到过的钟声跟这钟声完全不同，因为它能打动人的心。说这话的人是国王的儿子。因此别的人都说：“这种人总是想装得比别人聪明一点。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That surely cannot be the bell," said one of the children, lying down and listening. "This must be looked to." So he remained, and let the others go on without him.</div>

<div class="line_en">They afterwards came to a little house, made of branches and the bark of trees; a large wild apple-tree bent over it, as if it would shower down all its blessings on the roof, where roses were blooming.

<div class="line_en">"Why, then, we can go together," said the King's Son. But the poor child that had been confirmed was quite ashamed; he looked at his wooden shoes, pulled at the short sleeves of his jacket, and said that he was afraid he could not walk so fast; besides, he thought that the bell must be looked for to the right; for that was the place where all sorts of beautiful things were to be found.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们一块儿走吧！”王子说。这个穿着木鞋的孩子感到非常尴尬。他把上衣的短袖子拉了一下，说他恐怕不能走得像王子那样快；此外，他认为钟声一定是从右边来的，因为右边的景象很庄严和美丽。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But there we shall not meet," said the King's Son, nodding at the same time to the poor boy, who went into the darkest, thickest part of the wood, where thorns tore his humble dress, and scratched his face and hands and feet till they bled. The King's Son got some scratches too; but the sun shone on his path, and it is him that we will follow, for he was an excellent and resolute youth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这样一来，我们就碰不到头了！”王子说，对这穷苦的孩子点了点头。孩子向这树林最深最密的地方走去。荆棘把他寒碜的衣服钩破了，把他的脸、手和脚划得流出血来。王子身上也有好几处伤痕，不过他所走的路却充满了太阳光。我们现在就要注意他的行程，因为他是一个聪明的孩子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I must and will find the bell," said he, "even if I am obliged to go to the end of the world."</div>

<div class="line_en">But on he went, without being disheartened, deeper and deeper into the wood, where the most wonderful flowers were growing. There stood white lilies with blood-red stamina, skyblue tulips, which shone as they waved in the winds, and apple-trees, the apples of which looked exactly like large soapbubbles: so only think how the trees must have sparkled in the sunshine! Around the nicest green meads, where the deer were playing in the grass, grew magnificent oaks and beeches; and if the bark of one of the trees was cracked, there grass and long creeping plants grew in the crevices. And there were large calm lakes there too, in which white swans were swimming, and beat the air with their wings. The King's Son often stood still and listened. He thought the bell sounded from the depths of these still lakes; but then he remarked again that the tone proceeded not from there, but farther off, from out the depths of the forest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过他不怕困难，他一步一步地向树林的深处走。那儿长着许多奇异的花：含有红蕊的、像星星一样的百合花，在微风中射出光彩的、天蓝色的郁金香，结着像大肥皂泡一样发亮的果实的苹果树。你想想看，这些树在太阳光中该是多么光彩夺目啊。四周是一片非常美丽的绿草原。草上有公鹿和母鹿在嬉戏，而且还有茂盛的栎树和山毛榉。草和藤本植物从树缝里长出来。这一大片林木中还有静静的湖，湖里还有游泳着的白天鹅，它们在拍着翅膀。王子站着静静地听。他常常觉得钟声是从深沉的湖里飘上来的；不过他马上就注意到，钟声并不是从湖里来的，而是从森林的深处来的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And he seized hold of the creeping-plants, and the roots of trees-climbed up the moist stones where the water-snakes were writhing and the toads were croaking-and he gained the summit before the sun had quite gone down. How magnificent was the sight from this height! The sea-the great, the glorious sea, that dashed its long waves against the coast-was stretched out before him. And yonder, where sea and sky meet, stood the sun, like a large shining altar, all melted together in the most glowing colors. And the wood and the sea sang a song of rejoicing, and his heart sang with the rest: all nature was a vast holy church, in which the trees and the buoyant clouds were the pillars, flowers and grass the velvet carpeting, and heaven itself the large cupola. The red colors above faded away as the sun vanished, but a million stars were lighted, a million lamps shone; and the King's Son spread out his arms towards heaven, and wood, and sea; when at the same moment, coming by a path to the right, appeared, in his wooden shoes and jacket, the poor boy who had been confirmed with him. He had followed his own path, and had reached the spot just as soon as the son of the king had done. They ran towards each other, and stood together hand in hand in the vast church of nature and of poetry, while over them sounded the invisible holy bell: blessed spirits floated around them, and lifted up their voices in a rejoicing hallelujah!</div>
