<div class="line_en">"She's ashore all right," said Maxim. "I was watching her from the headland and I saw her come right into the bay, and head for the reef. They'll never shift her, not with these tides. She must have mistaken the bay for Kerrith harbour. It's like a wall out there, in the bay. Tell them in the house to stand by with food and drink in case these fellows want anything, and ring through to the office to Mr Crawley and tell him what's happened. I'm going back to the cove to see if I can do anything. Get me some cigarettes, will you?"</div>

Why don't they keep them for the kiddies on Saturday night?' And then the next one came, and then the third. "That's not fireworks," says Robert, 'that's a ship in distress.'

<div class="line_en">I went out on the terrace. I could see the trees taking shape beyond the lawns. The fog was lifting, it was rising in little clouds to the sky above. It whirled above my head in wreaths of smoke. I looked up at the windows above my head. They were tightly closed, and the shutters were fastened. They looked as though they would never open, never be thrown wide.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我走出屋子，来到平台，只见草坪那头的树木正从雾中探出身来。浓雾化作团团微云，向空中升去，开始消散，水汽在我头上如烟圈般打旋。我抬头望望宅子上部的窗户，窗子都已关得严严实实，下着百叶窗，那模样就好像再也不准备开启，一辈子再也不会有人来推开窗户透气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was by the large window in the centre that I had stood five minutes before. How high it seemed above my head, how lofty and remote. The stones were hard and solid under my feet. I looked down at my feet and then up again to the shuttered window, and as I did so I became aware suddenly that my head was swimming and I felt hot. A little trickle of perspiration ran down the back of my neck. Black dots jumped about in the air in front of me. I went into the hall again and sat down on a chair. My hands were quite wet. I sat very still, holding my knees.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="五分钟前我正站在居中的那扇大窗旁。此刻看来那窗子离我头顶距离极远，高高在上，何其巍然。我踩着坚硬的石块，低头看自己的双脚，接着又举目望望紧闭的百叶窗，这时我突然觉得一阵眩晕，浑身闷热难受，脖子背上淌下一股汗水的细流，眼前金星乱舞。于是，我又走回大厅，找了张椅子坐下。我的双手汗津津的，抱着膝盖，静坐着一动也不动。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The fog was rising, lifting to the tops of the trees. I could see the woods at the end of the lawns. Above my head a pale sun tried to penetrate the heavy sky. It was hotter than ever. Oppressive, as Frith had said. A bee hummed by me in search of scent, bumbling, noisy, and then creeping inside a flower was suddenly silent. On the grass banks above the lawns the gardener started his mowing machine. A startled linnet fled from the whirring blades towards the rose-garden. The gardener bent to the handles of the machine and walked slowly along the bank scattering the short-tipped grass and the pin-point daisy-heads. The smell of the sweet warm grass came towards me on the air, and the sun shone down upon me full and strong from out of the white mist. I whistled for Jasper but he did not come. Perhaps he had followed Maxim when he went down to the beach. I glanced at my watch. It was after half past twelve, nearly twenty to one. This time yesterday Maxim and I were standing with Frank in the little garden in front of his house, waiting for his housekeeper to serve lunch. Twenty-four hours ago. They were teasing me, baiting me about my dress. "You'll both get the surprise of your lives," I had said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雾正消散，已往上退到树梢头。这时我已能看到草坪尽头的林子。在我的头顶惨淡的太阳正挣扎着想穿透雾蒙蒙的天空。天更加热了，正像弗里思刚才说的那样，闷得叫人透不过气。一只蜜蜂嗡嗡飞过我身旁，吵吵嚷嚷，东问西撞，寻着花香而去。待它钻进一朵花去采蜜，嗡嗡声才戛然而止。草坪边的草坡上，园丁开动了刈草机，一只红雀被飕飕作声的刈草刀片惊起，朝玫瑰园一溜烟飞去。园丁弓着身子，握着刈草机的手柄，沿草坡慢慢往前走，草屑和雏菊的小花四散飞扬。微风吹来，带着温热的草香；太阳透过白色的水汽，火辣辣地照在我头上。我打着唿哨，呼唤杰斯珀，但不见长耳狗的踪迹。也许这畜生随着迈克西姆往海滩去了，我看看手表，已经过了十二点半，差不多再过二十分钟就到一点，昨天这时候，迈克西姆和我正同弗兰克一起站在他家门前的小花园里，等候他的管家开午饭。这是二十四小时前的事。当时两人都在笑话我。想方设法要打听我将穿什么样的化装舞眼。我说“你们俩不大吃一惊才怪呢”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No. Very good, Madam."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那好，太太”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No. No, I think I'll go out in a moment or two. Don't bother, Frith."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，不必。稍隔片刻我还得出去。别麻烦了，弗里思”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He went away and left me alone in the hall. It was quiet sitting there, quiet and cool. All trace of the party had been cleared away. It might never have happened. The hall was as it had always been, grey and silent and austere, with the portraits and the weapons on the wall. I could scarcely believe that last night I had stood there in my blue dress at the bottom of the stairs, shaking hands with five hundred people. I could not believe that there had been music-stands in the minstrels' gallery, and a band playing there, a man with a fiddle, a man with a drum. I got up and went out on to the terrace again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他走了，让我独自留在大厅里。坐在这儿倒挺安静，也还凉快。昨夜舞会留下的痕迹都已扫除干净，简直就像压根儿没发生过这回事。大厅还是平时那模样：色调灰暗，一片死寂，阴森严峻，墙上照样挂满人像画和兵器。我简直不敢相信，昨夜自己曾穿着那件蓝色袍子，站在楼梯脚跟前，同五百位来宾握手；我也不能想象，吟游诗人画廊里曾摆开乐谱架，小乐队在此演奏，有一个提琴手和一个鼓手。我站起身，出了门，又走上平台。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="于是，我也沿着陡峭的蜿蜒小径，穿过黑压压的林子，直奔坡下的海滩而去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I felt sick with shame at the memory of my words. And then I realized for the first time that Maxim had not gone away as I had feared. The voice I had heard on the terrace was calm and practical. The voice I knew. Not the voice of last night when I stood at the head of the stairs. Maxim had not gone away. He was down there in the cove somewhere. He was himself, normal and sane. He had just been for a walk, as Frank had said. He had been on the headland, he had seen the ship closing in towards the shore. All my fears were without foundation. Maxim was safe. Maxim was all right. I had just experienced something that was degrading and horrible and mad, something that I did not fully understand even now, that I had no wish to remember, that I wanted to bury for ever more deep in the shadows of my mind with old forgotten terrors of childhood; but even this did not matter as long as Maxim was all right.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="记起自己说过的这句话，我真是羞愧得无地自容。到这时我才意识到迈克西姆并未出走，自己原先的顾虑没有道理。我刚才听到他在平台上说话，那嗓音平和镇静，就事论事地吩咐别人干这干那，正是我所熟悉的声音，不像昨夜我出现在楼梯口时听到的嗓音那么可怕。迈克西姆并未出走！他在下面小海湾里的什么地方忙碌着。他还是老样子，神志正常而清醒。正如弗兰克所说，他只不过是出去散一会步；他到过海岬，在那儿见到有艘船漂近海岸。我的恐惧疑虑全是没有根据的。迈克西姆安然无恙；迈克西姆没出什么问题。我只是做了一场恶梦，一场有失身分的颠三倒四的恶梦，其含义即使在此刻我还不十分明白。我不愿回过头去重温这场恶梦，巴不得把它同遗忘已久的童年的恐怖经历一起，永远深埋在记忆的阴暗角落里。不过话说回来，只要迈克西姆还是好好的，即便做一场恶梦又有何妨！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The fog had almost gone, and when I came to the cove I could see the ship at once, lying about two miles offshore with her bows pointed towards the cliffs. I went along the breakwater and stood at the end of it, leaning against the rounded wall. There was a crowd of people on the cliffs already who must have walked along the coastguard path from Kerrith. The cliffs and the headland were part of Manderley, but the public had always used the right-of-way along the cliffs. Some of them were scrambling down the cliff face to get a closer view of the stranded ship. She lay at an awkward angle, her stern tilted, and there were a number of rowing-boats already pulling round her. The lifeboat was standing off. I saw someone stand up in her and shout through a megaphone. I could not hear what he was saying. It was still misty out in the bay, and I could not see the horizon. Another motor boat chugged into the light with some men aboard. The motor boat was dark grey. I could see someone in uniform. That would be the harbour-master from Kerrith, and the Lloyd's agent with him. Another motor boat followed, a party of holiday-makers from Kerrith aboard. They circled round and round the stranded steamer chatting excitedly. I could hear their voices echoing across the still water.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，雾已差不多散尽。来到小海湾，我一眼便瞧见那艘搁浅的船。船停在离岸两英里的地方，船头朝着礁岩。我沿着防波堤走去，在堤的尽头站定，身子倚在筑成圆弧形的堤墙上。山头悬崖边已聚集了一大群人，大概都是沿着海岸警卫队的巡逻路线从克里斯走来看热闹的。这儿的悬崖和海岬全是曼陀而庄园的一部分，但外人都一贯行使穿越悬崖的通行权。有些看热闹的闲人竟沿着峭壁爬下来，以便从近处观察搁浅的船只。那条船搁浅的角度很别扭，船尾往上翘着。这时已有好几条小艇从四面八方向搁浅的船只划去；救生艇已离岸出动，我看见有人正站在救生艇里通过扩音器哇啦哇啦叫嚷。此人说些什么，我听不清。海湾仍然蒙在迷雾中，望不见地平线。又有一艘汽艇突突地驶来，艇上站着好几个男人。那汽艇是深褐色的，我看见艇上的乘员穿着制服，大概是克里斯的港务长和随行的劳埃德协会①代办。另一艘满载度假旅客的汽艇跟随在后，从克里斯驶来，两艘汽艇围着搁浅的轮船来回绕圈子，艇上的人正起劲地议论着什么。我听到这些人说话的声音在静静的水面上飘过，引起回响。[注：①英国的船舶注册协会，发布年鉴，载明船舶的等级、吨位等。]">查看中文翻译</div>

The gulls no longer wheeled overhead, they had settled on the water a little distance from the ship. More pleasure boats appeared during the afternoon. It must be a field day for Kerrith boatmen. The diver came up and then went down again. One of the tugs steamed away while the other still stood by. The harbour-master went back in his grey motor boat, taking some men with him, and the diver who had come to the surface for the second time. The crew of the ship leant against the side throwing scraps to the gulls, while visitors in pleasure boats rowed slowly round the ship. Nothing happened at all. It was dead low water now, and the ship was heeled at an angle, the propeller showing clean. Little ridges of white cloud formed in the western sky and the sun became pallid. It was still very hot.

A leaf fell onto my hand from the tree above. I shivered for no reason.</div>

<div class="line_en">The house looked very peaceful as I came upon it from the woods and crossed the lawns. It seemed sheltered and protected, more beautiful than I had ever seen it. Standing there, looking down upon it from the banks, I realized, perhaps for the first time, with a funny feeling of bewilderment and pride that it was my home, I belonged there, and Manderley belonged to me. The trees and the grass and the flower tubs on the terrace were reflected in the mullioned windows. A thin column of smoke rose in the air from one of the chimneys. The new-cut grass on the lawn smelt sweet as hay. A blackbird was singing on the chestnut tree. A yellow butterfly winged his foolish way before me to the terrace.</div>

<div class="line_en">I went and sat on the window-seat in the library. It seemed funny without Jasper. He must have gone with Maxim. The old dog lay asleep in her basket. I picked up The Times and turned the pages without reading it. It was queer this feeling of marking time, like sitting in a waiting-room at a dentist's. I knew I should never settle to my knitting or to a book. I was waiting for something to happen, something unforeseen. The horror of my morning and the stranded ship and not having any lunch had all combined to give birth to a latent sense of excitement at the back of my mind that I did not understand. It was as though I had entered into a new phase of my life and nothing would be quite the same again. The girl who had dressed for the fancy dress ball the night before had been left behind. It had all happened a very long time ago. This self who sat on the window-seat was new, was different… Robert brought in my tea, and I ate my bread-and-butter hungrily. He had brought scones as well, and some sandwiches, and an angel cake. He must have thought it derogatory to bring bread-and-butter alone, nor was it Manderley routine. I was glad of the scones and the angel cake. I remembered I had only had cold tea at half past eleven, and no breakfast. Just after I had drunk my third cup Robert came in again.</div>
