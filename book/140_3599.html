<div class="line_en">I would not, if I could, here or to-day, embody a record of my later years of unspeakable misery, and unpardonable crime. This epoch -- these later years -- took unto themselves a sudden elevation in turpitude, whose origin alone it is my present purpose to assign. Men usually grow base by degrees. From me, in an instant, all virtue dropped bodily as a mantle. From comparatively trivial wickedness I passed, with the stride of a giant, into more than the enormities of an Elah-Gabalus. What chance -- what one event brought this evil thing to pass, bear with me while I relate. Death approaches; and the shadow which foreruns him has thrown a softening influence over my spirit. I long, in passing through the dim valley, for the sympathy -- I had nearly said for the pity -- of my fellow men. I would fain have them believe that I have been, in some measure, the slave of circumstances beyond human control. I would wish them to seek out for me, in the details I am about to give, some little oasis of fatality amid a wilderness of error. I would have them allow -- what they cannot refrain from allowing -- that, although temptation may have erewhile existed as great, man was never thus, at least, tempted before -- certainly, never thus fell. And is it therefore that he has never thus suffered? Have I not indeed been living in a dream? And am I not now dying a victim to the horror and the mystery of the wildest of all sublunary visions?</div>

<div class="line_en">My earliest recollections of a school-life, are connected with a large, rambling, Elizabethan house, in a misty-looking village of England, where were a vast number of gigantic and gnarled trees, and where all the houses were excessively ancient. In truth, it was a dream-like and spirit-soothing place, that venerable old town. At this moment, in fancy, I feel the refreshing chilliness of its deeply-shadowed avenues, inhale the fragrance of its thousand shrubberies, and thrill anew with undefinable delight, at the deep hollow note of the church-bell, breaking, each hour, with sullen and sudden roar, upon the stillness of the dusky atmosphere in which the fretted Gothic steeple lay imbedded and asleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我对学校生活的最早记忆，总离不开一幢结构不规则的伊丽莎白式大房子①，房子建在伦敦一个雾蒙蒙的村子里，那儿有很多浑身疙疙瘩瘩的参天巨树，所有的房子都特别古旧。说真的，那个古老的小镇的确是个梦一般抚慰人心的所在。这一刻，在想象中，我体味着浓荫如盖的大街上那份沁人心脾的凉意，嗅着灌木林里散发出的芳香，听着低沉而空洞的教堂的钟声，我重新怀着说不清的喜悦颤抖了，钟声每隔一个小时就会冷不丁地敲响，阴森森的，在寂静的暗淡天光里回荡，那被岁月侵蚀的哥特式尖塔就掩映在暮色之中，沉沉而睡。【注：①指伊丽莎白女王时代流行的建筑式样，特征为窗户巨大，回廊幽长，烟囱高耸，还有很多带形装饰。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I am the descendant of a race whose imaginative and easily excitable temperament has at all times rendered them remarkable; and, in my earliest infancy, I gave evidence of having fully inherited the family character. As I advanced in years it was more strongly developed; becoming, for many reasons, a cause of serious disquietude to my friends, and of positive injury to myself. I grew self-willed, addicted to the wildest caprices, and a prey to the most ungovernable passions. Weak-minded, and beset with constitutional infirmities akin to my own, my parents could do but little to check the evil propensities which distinguished me. Some feeble and ill-directed efforts resulted in complete failure on their part, and, of course, in total triumph on mine. Thenceforward my voice was a household law; and at an age when few children have abandoned their leading-strings, I was left to the guidance of my own will, and became, in all but name, the master of my own actions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们这族人，一直以想象力丰富，性子暴躁而闻名，在幼年时代，我就表现出了完全继承家族特征的秉性。随着我一年一年地长大，这种秉性益发显著。由于多种原因，搞得我的朋友焦虑不堪，我自己也备受伤害。我变得一意孤行，沉溺于胡思乱想，情绪常常失控。我的父母天性优柔寡断，而且患有我这样的先天虚弱症，所以，他们也拿我那与众不同的坏性情毫无办法。他们也曾花费过心力，但因为软弱，方法不当，终于还是一败涂地，而我当然是大获全胜的一方。此后，我的话便成了家法。在大多数孩子还得牵着走路的年龄，我就开始率性而为了，除了名义上有父母，其实一切都是自己当家作主。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It gives me, perhaps, as much of pleasure as I can now in any manner experience, to dwell upon minute recollections of theschool and its concerns. Steeped in misery as I am -- misery, alas! only too real -- I shall be pardoned for seeking relief, however slight and temporary, in the weakness of a few rambling details. These, moreover, utterly trivial, and even ridiculous in themselves, assume, to my fancy, adventitious importance, as connected with a period and a locality when and where I recognise the first ambiguous monitions of the destiny which afterwards so fully overshadowed me.

<div class="line_en">The house, I have said, was old and irregular. The grounds were extensive, and a high and solid brick wall, topped with a bed of mortar and broken glass, encompassed the whole. This prison-like rampart formed the limit of our domain; beyond it we saw but thrice a week -- once every Saturday afternoon, when, attended by two ushers, we were permitted to take brief walks in a body through some of the neighbouring fields -- and twice during Sunday, when we were paraded in the same formal manner to the morning and evening service in the one church of the village. Of this church the principal of our school was pastor. With how deep a spirit of wonder and perplexity was I wont to regard him from our remote pew in the gallery, as, with step solemn and slow, he ascended the pulpit! This reverend man, with countenance so demurely benign, with robes so glossy and so clerically flowing, with wig so minutely powdered, so rigid and so vast, -- could this be he who, of late, with sour visage, and in snuffy habiliments, administered, ferule in hand, the Draconian laws of the academy? Oh, gigantic paradox, too utterly monstrous for solution!</div>

<div class="line_en">The extensive enclosure was irregular in form, having many capacious recesses. Of these, three or four of the largest constituted the play-ground. It was level, and covered with fine hard gravel. I well remember it had no trees, nor benches, nor anything similar within it. Of course it was in the rear of the house. In front lay a small parterre, planted with box and other shrubs; but through this sacred division we passed only upon rare occasions indeed -- such as a first advent to school or final departure thence, or perhaps, when a parent or friend having called for us, we joyfully took our way home for the Christmas or Midsummer holy-days.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="宽广的院子形状并不规则，墙壁有很多地方都凹进去很大一块。最大的三四个壁凹连成了操场。地面平坦，铺着上好的硬沙砾。我记得很清楚，没有树，也没有凳子，没有任何可以坐的东西。当然什么都在屋后。屋前有个小花坛，种着黄杨及其他小灌木，不过说实话，只有赶上难得的机会，才能经过这片圣地——比如第一次进校，最后一次离校，还有，就是在父母或朋友来找，我们兴冲冲地回家过圣诞或夏至节的时候。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At an angle of the ponderous wall frowned a more ponderous gate. It was riveted and studded with iron bolts, and surmounted with jagged iron spikes.

<div class="line_en">The school-room was the largest in the house -- I could not help thinking, in the world. It was very long, narrow, and dismally low, with pointed Gothic windows and a ceiling of oak. In a remote and terror-inspiring angle was a square enclosure of eight or ten feet, comprising the sanctum, "during hours," of our principal, the Reverend Dr. Bransby. It was a solid structure, with massy door, sooner than open which in the absence of the "Dominie," we would all have willingly perished by thepeine forte et dure. In other angles were two other similar boxes, far less reverenced, indeed, but still greatly matters of awe. One of these was the pulpit of the "classical" usher, one of the "English and mathematical." Interspersed about the room, crossing and re-crossing in endless irregularity, were innumerable benches and desks, black, ancient, and time-worn, piled desperately with much-bethumbed books, and so beseamed with initial letters, names at full length, grotesque figures, and other multiplied efforts of the knife, as to have entirely lost what little of original form mighthave been their portion in days long departed. A huge bucket with water stood at one extremity of the room, and a clock of stupendous dimensions at the other.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="做教室的那个房间最大，我不由觉得，它是世界上最大的一间。房间狭长，屋顶很底，煞是沉闷。窗子是哥特式的，天花板是橡木的。在远处一个恐怖的角落，围出了个八九英尺见方的小屋子，那是一间密室——是我们的校长，牧师勃兰斯比博士“授课时间”的密室。小屋结构坚固，房门厚重。即便主人不在，我们宁愿活活地处罚死，也不会开一下门。在另外两个角落里，还有两个相似的斗室，虽然远不及校长大人那间令人肃然，但也让人心生敬畏。一间属于“古典文学”教师，一间属于“英语兼数学”教师。教室里散布着课桌和凳子，横七竖八，数也数不清。桌凳都是黑漆漆的，老旧破烂。桌上乱糟糟地堆放着翻黑的书本、刻满缩写字母，有的连名带姓刻上长长的一串、还有希奇古怪的图案和用刀子刻了多次留下的记号。因此，早在很早很早以前，就已经彻底面目全非了。房间的一头，放着一只水桶，里面盛着水；另一头，是一个大得惊人的钟。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But the house! -- how quaint an old building was this! -- to me how veritably a palace of enchantment! There was really no end to its windings -- to its incomprehensible subdivisions. It was difficult, at any given time, to say with certainty upon which of its two stories one happened to be. From each room to every other there were sure to be found three or four steps either in ascent or descent. Then the lateral branches were innumerable -- inconceivable -- and so returning in upon themselves, that our most exact ideas in regard to the whole mansion were not very far different from those with which we pondered upon infinity. During the five years of my residence here, I was never able to ascertain with precision, in what remote locality lay the little sleeping apartment assigned to myself and some eighteen or twenty other scholars.</div>

The morning's awakening, the nightly summons to bed; the connings, the recitations; the periodical half-holidays, and perambulations; the play-ground, with its broils, its pastimes, its intrigues; -- these, by a mental sorcery long forgotten, were made to involve a wilderness of sensation, a world of rich incident, an universe of varied emotion, of excitement the most passionate and spirit-stirring.

<div class="line_en">Encompassed by the massy walls of this venerable academy, I passed, yet not in tedium or disgust, the years of the third lustrum of my life. The teeming brain of childhood requires no external world of incident to occupy or amuse it; and the apparently dismal monotony of a school was replete with more intense excitement than my riper youth has derived from luxury, or my full manhood from crime. Yet I must believe that my first mental development had in it much of the uncommon -- even much of the outré. Upon mankind at large the events of very early existence rarely leave in mature age any definite impression. All is gray shadow -- a weak and irregular remembrance -- an indistinct regathering of feeble pleasures and phantasmagoric pains. With me this is not so. In childhood I must have felt with the energy of a man what I now find stamped upon memory in lines as vivid, as deep, and as durable as the exergues of the Carthaginian medals.</div>

<div class="line_en">In truth, the ardor, the enthusiasm, and the imperiousness of my disposition, soon rendered me a marked character among my schoolmates, and by slow, but natural gradations, gave me an ascendancy over all not greatly older than myself; -- over all with a single exception. This exception was found in the person of a scholar, who, although no relation, bore the same Christian and surname as myself; -- a circumstance, in fact, little remarkable; for, notwithstanding a noble descent, mine was one of those every-day appellations which seem, by prescriptive right, to have been, time out of mind, the common property of the mob. In this narrativeI have therefore designated myself as William Wilson, -- a fictitious title not very dissimilar to the real. My namesake alone, of those who in school-phraseology constituted "our set," presumed to compete with me in the studies of the class -- in the sports and broils of the play-ground -- to refuse implicit belief in my assertions, and submission to my will -- indeed, to interfere with my arbitrary dictation in any respect whatsoever.

<div class="line_en">Wilson's rebellion was to me a source of the greatest embarrassment; -- the more so as, in spite of the bravado with which in public I made a point of treating him and his pretensions, I secretly felt that I feared him, and could not help thinking the equality which he maintained so easily with myself, a proof of his true superiority; since not to be overcome cost me a perpetual struggle. Yet this superiority -- even this equality -- was in truth acknowledged by no one but myself; our associates, by some unaccountable blindness, seemed not even to suspect it. Indeed, his competition, his resistance, and especially his impertinent and dogged interference with my purposes, were not more pointed than private. He appeared to be destitute alike of the ambition which urged, and of the passionate energy of mind which enabled me to excel. In his rivalry he might have been supposed actuated solely by a whimsical desire to thwart, astonish, or mortify myself; although there were times when I could not help observing, with a feeling made up of wonder, abasement, and pique, that he mingled with his injuries, his insults, or his contradictions, a certain most inappropriate, and assuredly most unwelcome affectionateness of manner. I could only conceive this singular behavior to arise from a consummate self-conceit assuming the vulgar airs of patronage and protection.</div>

<div class="line_en">It may seem strange that in spite of the continual anxiety occasioned me by the rivalry of Wilson, and his intolerable spirit of contradiction, I could not bring myself to hate him altogether. We had, to be sure, nearly every day a quarrel in which, yielding me publicly the palm of victory, he, in some manner, contrived to make me feel that it was he who had deserved it; yet a sense of pride on my part, and a veritable dignity on his own, kept us always upon what are called "speaking terms," while there were many points of strong congeniality in our tempers, operating to awake in me a sentiment which our position alone, perhaps, prevented from ripening into friendship. It is difficult, indeed, to define, or even to describe, my real feelings towards him. They formed a motley and heterogeneous admixture; -- some petulant animosity, which was not yet hatred, some esteem, more respect, much fear, with a world of uneasy curiosity. To the moralist it will be unnecessary to say, in addition, that Wilson and myself were the most inseparable of companions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管威尔逊总和我较劲儿，可似乎有点奇怪的是，他那叫人忍无可忍的反驳精神，虽然令我时时感到焦虑，却没有勾起我对他的恨意。我们自然是几乎天天吵架，可当着人的面，他总是让我赢，可一边又能想办法让我感觉到，赢家应该是他。不过，由于我的自尊心以及他那份真正的尊严，我们总是保持着“泛泛之交”，与此同时，我们有很多地方又性情相投。这让我意识到，可能是我们所处的位置，才是我们成为朋友的障碍。要想给我对他的感情下个定义，那真是太难了，甚至描述一下，都不易。这感情错综复杂，一言难尽——有几分任性的仇视，却也并非仇恨；有着尊重，多的是敬意；害怕的成分不少，却又好奇得心神不宁。对道德家来说，倒没必要补上一句，我和威尔逊是难分难舍弃的好同伴。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Perhaps it was this latter trait in Wilson's conduct, conjoined with our identity of name, and the mere accident of our having entered the school upon the same day, which set afloat the notion that we were brothers, among the senior classes in the academy. These do not usually inquire with much strictness into the affairs of their juniors. I have before said, or should have said, thatWilson was not, in the most remote degree, connected with my family. But assuredly if we had been brothers we must have been twins; for, after leaving Dr. Bransby's, I casually learned that my namesake was born on the nineteenth of January, 1813 -- and this is a somewhat remarkable coincidence; for the day is precisely that of my own nativity.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="或许，正因威尔逊举止中的这点亲热，加上我们又同名同姓，刚巧又在同一天入校，所以，在高年级里就流传开我们是兄弟的说法了。高年级学生对低年级学生的事情，很少认真查究。其实，威尔逊和我家压根一点关系都没有，这一点，我在前面说过，我应该是说过的。如果我们是兄弟，那么准是双胞胎，因为在我离开勃兰斯比那个学校后，无意中得知，同名同姓的那个人生于一八一三年一月十九日——这真是惊人的巧合，因为那一天，正好也是我的生日。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was no doubt the anomalous state of affairs existing between us, which turned all my attacks upon him, (and they were many, either open or covert) into the channel of banter or practical joke (giving pain while assuming the aspect of mere fun) rather than into a more serious and determined hostility. But my endeavours on this head were by no means uniformly successful, even when my plans were the most wittily concocted; for my namesake had much about him, in character, of that unassuming and quiet austerity which, while enjoying the poignancy of its own jokes, has no heel of Achilles in itself, and absolutely refuses to be laughed at. I could find, indeed, but one vulnerable point, and that, lying in a personal peculiarity, arising, perhaps, from constitutional disease, would have been spared by any antagonist less at his wit's end than myself; -- my rival had a weakness in the faucial or guttural organs, which precluded him from raising his voice at anytime above a very low whisper. Of this defect I did not fall to take what poor advantage lay in my power.疑,我和他的关系很反常.所以,我对他不遗余力的攻击--攻击很多,明的暗的都有,总是表现为半真半假的嬉笑怒骂,而非清坚决绝的敌对.但我的玩笑,却总刺痛他的心.不过我在这方面纵然是煞费苦心,机关算尽,也难免有闪失的时候,因为那同名同姓的人,天性谦逊、宁静、严肃,表现在欣赏自己那套辛辣的笑话上,他那份严肃真叫无懈可击,无论如何都是绝对不肯被人嘲笑的.说真的,我只在他身上找到一个弱点,他身上有个特征,或许这是先天性的疾病--我的对手的咽喉器官,或者说发音器官有毛病,无论何时都提不高嗓音,总像是微弱的耳语.他的任何冤家,不像我那样被他逼得黔驴技穷的,从不就此伤害他;我可不会放过这上苍赐予的大好机会.</div>

<div class="line_en">Wilson's retaliations in kind were many; and there was one form of his practical wit that disturbed me beyond measure. How his sagacity first discovered at all that so petty a thing would vex me, is a question I never could solve; but, having discovered, he habitually practised the annoyance. I had always felt aversion to my uncourtly patronymic, and its very common, if not plebeian prænomen. The words were venom in my ears; and when, upon the day of my arrival, a second William Wilson came also to the academy, I felt angry with him for bearing the name, and doubly disgusted with the name because a stranger bore it, who would be the cause of its twofold repetition, who would be constantly in my presence, and whose concerns, in the ordinary routine of the school business, must inevitably, on account of the detestable coincidence, be often confounded with my own.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="威尔逊对我的报复五花八门。最灵验的一招是让我大伤脑筋。他那么睿智，开头何以发现耍一耍这个雕虫小技就能惹恼我？这一点我永远弄不明白。不过他一旦发现了这一招，就频频使用，害我生气。我一向厌恶自己平庸的姓氏，还有这普通透顶的名字——如果没流为平民百姓所用，倒也罢了。这姓名一钻进我的耳朵，就好像是灌进了毒液。我第一天到校时，另一个威廉。威尔逊也来了。我对他无比愤怒，他怎么也叫这个名字？于是，我对这姓名又增加了一重厌恶，因为一个陌生人居然也以威廉。威尔逊命名。而他，就是使这个名字被双倍喊叫的人。他会经常在我眼前闪现；在学校生活的日常事务中，总会不可避免地把我们两人混为一谈。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I had not then discovered the remarkable fact that we were of the same age; but I saw that we were of the same height, and I perceived that we were even singularly alike in general contour of person and outline of feature. I was galled, too, by the rumor touching a relationship, which had grown current in the upper forms. In a word, nothing could more seriously disturb me, (although I scrupulously concealed such disturbance,) than any allusion to a similarity of mind, person, or condition existing between us. But, in truth, I had no reason to believe that (with the exception of the matter of relationship, and in the case of Wilson himself,) this similarity had ever been made a subject of comment, or even observed at all by our schoolfellows. That he observed it in all its bearings, and as fixedly as I, was apparent; but that he could discover in such circumstances so fruitful a field of annoyance, can only be attributed, as I said before, to his more than ordinary penetration.</div>

<div class="line_en">How greatly this most exquisite portraiture harassed me, (for it could not justly be termed a caricature,) I will not now venture to describe. I had but one consolation -- in the fact that the imitation, apparently, was noticed by myself alone, and that I had to endure only the knowing and strangely sarcastic smiles of my namesake himself. Satisfied with having produced in my bosom the intended effect, he seemed to chuckle in secret over the sting he had inflicted, and was characteristically disregardful of the public applause which the success of his witty endeavours might have so easily elicited. That the school, indeed, did not feel his design, perceive its accomplishment, and participate in his sneer, was, for many anxious months, a riddle I could not resolve. Perhaps the gradation of his copy rendered it not so readily perceptible; or, more possibly, I owed my security to the masterly air of the copyist, who, disdaining the letter, (which in a painting is all the obtuse can see,) gave but the full spirit of his original for my individual contemplation and chagrin.</div>

<div class="line_en">As it was, I at length grew restive in the extreme under his distasteful supervision, and daily resented more and more openly what I considered his intolerable arrogance. I have said that, in the first years of our connexion as schoolmates, my feelings in regard tohim might have been easily ripened into friendship: but, in the latter months of my residence at the academy, although the intrusion of his ordinary manner had, beyond doubt, in some measure, abated, my sentiments, in nearly similar proportion, partook very much of positive hatred. Upon one occasion he saw this, I think, and afterwards avoided, or made a show of avoiding me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最终，他那令人讨厌的监督，使我失去了耐心。他的自以为是真让人受不了，我对他的愤恨变得一天比一天露骨。我说过了，在和他同学的头几年里，我对他的感情不难成熟为友谊；可学校生涯的最后几个月，无疑地，他平日爱管我闲事的脾性减轻了几分，尽管如此，我心中的恨意，反而增加了几分。有一回，我想他是看出来了，从那以后他就躲避我，或者说假装躲避我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I have already more than once spoken of the disgusting air of patronage which he assumed toward me, and of his frequent officious interference with my will. This interference often took the ungracious character of advice; advice not openly given, but hinted or insinuated. I received it with a repugnance which gained strength as I grew in years. Yet, at this distant day, let me do him the simple justice to acknowledge that I can recall no occasion when the suggestions of my rival were on the side of those errors or follies so usual to his immature age and seeming inexperience; that his moral sense, at least, if not his general talents and worldly wisdom, was far keener than my own; and that I might, to-day, have been a better, and thus a happier man, had I less frequently rejected the counsels embodied in those meaning whispers which I then but too cordially hated and too bitterly despised.</div>

<div class="line_en">One night, about the close of my fifth year at the school, and immediately after the altercation just mentioned, finding every one wrapped in sleep, I arose from bed, and, lamp in hand, stole through a wilderness of narrow passages from my own bedroom to that of my rival. I had long been plotting one of those ill-natured pieces of practical wit at his expense in which I had hitherto been so uniformly unsuccessful. It was my intention, now, to put my scheme in operation, and I resolved to make himfeel the whole extent of the malice with which I was imbued. Having reached his closet, I noiselessly entered, leaving the lamp, with a shade over it, on the outside. I advanced a step, and listened to the sound of his tranquil breathing. Assured of his being asleep, I returned, took the light, and with it again approached the bed. Close curtains were around it, which, in the prosecution of my plan, I slowly and quietly withdrew, when the bright rays fell vividly upon the sleeper, and my eyes, at the same moment, upon his countenance. I looked; -- and a numbness, an iciness of feeling instantly pervaded my frame. My breast heaved, my knees tottered, my whole spirit became possessed with an objectless yet intolerable horror. Gasping for breath, I lowered the lamp in still nearer proximity to the face. Were these -- these the lineaments of William Wilson? I saw, indeed, that they were his, but I shook as if with a fit of the ague in fancying they were not. What was there about them to confound me in this manner? I gazed; -- while my brain reeled with a multitude of incoherent thoughts. Not thus he appeared -- assuredly not thus -- in the vivacity of his waking hours. The same name! the same contour of person! the same day of arrival at the academy! And then his dogged and meaningless imitation of my gait, my voice, my habits, and my manner! Was it, in truth, within the bounds of human possibility, that what I now saw was the result, merely, of the habitual practice of this sarcastic imitation? Awe-stricken, and with a creeping shudder, I extinguished the lamp, passed silently from the chamber, and left, at once, the halls of that old academy, never to enter them again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大约在我第五年的学校生活快结束的时候，一天晚上，就在上文提到的那次吵架后不久，每个人都已酣然入梦，我从床上爬起来，手里提着灯，穿过一道狭窄的走道，悄悄溜到了冤家对头的寝室。我早就想使出一个恶毒的花招，拿他寻寻开心，好让他尝尝我的厉害，可一直没有得逞。现在，计划就要付诸实施了，我一定要让他感觉到，我对他的怨毒，早已是山高海深。到他的小屋门口了。我把灯留在外面，扣上罩子，蹑手蹑脚进了门。我朝前走了一步，倾听着他安静的呼吸。确信他真的睡着了，我折身出去，取了灯，再次走到他的床边。床的四周密密实实地挂着帐子。要实施计划了。我慢慢地把帐子掀开。当明亮的光线照在睡着的人身上时，我的眼睛也落在了他的脸上。一望之下，顿时浑身麻木，好似兜头泼了盆冷水。我心口狂跳，膝盖颤抖，无缘无故地，惊骇得受不了。我直喘大气，我无声地把灯又放低了些，低到要挨着他的脸。这就是——这就是威廉。威尔逊的面容么？我真切地看到，他就是这副模样，可一想到他仿佛长得并不是这样，我就止不住发疟疾一样颤抖起来。这副容貌怎会把我吓得魂不附体呢？我凝视着他——我的脑子如同塞进一团乱麻，各种念头鱼贯而来。他醒着的时候，可不是这个样子，绝不是这个样子。同名同姓！同样的面容！同一天进学校！接着，他莫名其妙而又无比顽固地模仿我的步态、我的声音、我的习惯、我的举止！他一贯模仿我，难道这具有讽刺意味的模仿，真的使他变成我现在所看到的模样？我被敬畏的感觉击中了，周身战栗，灭了灯，悄悄走出房间，马上离开了古旧的学校，从此再没有跨进去一步。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After a lapse of some months, spent at home in mere idleness, I found myself a student at Eton. The brief interval had been sufficient to enfeeble my remembrance of the events at Dr. Bransby's, or at least to effect a material change in the nature of the feelings with which I remembered them. The truth -- the tragedy -- of the drama was no more. I could now find room to doubt the evidence of my senses; and seldom called up the subject at all but with wonder at the extent of human credulity, and a smile at the vivid force of the imagination which I hereditarily possessed. Neither was this species of skepticism likely to be diminished by the character of the life I led at Eton. The vortex of thoughtlessfolly into which I there so immediately and so recklessly plunged, washed away all but the froth of my past hours, engulfed at once every solid or serious impression, and left to memory only the veriest levities of a former existence.</div>

<div class="line_en">I do not wish, however, to trace the course of my miserable profligacy here -- a profligacy which set at defiance the laws, while it eluded the vigilance of the institution. Three years of folly, passed without profit, had but given me rooted habits of vice, and added, in a somewhat unusual degree, to my bodily stature, when, after a week of soulless dissipation, I invited a small party of the most dissolute students to a secret carousal in my chambers. We met at a late hour of the night; for our debaucheries were to be faithfully protracted until morning. The wine flowed freely, and there were not wanting other and perhaps more dangerous seductions; so that the grey dawn had already faintly appeared in the east, while our delirious extravagance was at its height. Madly flushed with cards and intoxication, I was in the act of insisting upon a toast of more than wonted profanity, when my attention was suddenly diverted by the violent, although partial unclosing of the door of the apartment, and by the eager voice of a servant from without. He said that some person, apparently in great haste, demanded to speak with me in the hall.</div>

I staggered forward at once, and a few steps brought me to the vestibule of the building. In this low and small room there hung no lamp; and now no light at all was admitted, save that of the exceedingly feeble dawn which made its way through the semi-circular window. As I put my foot over the threshold, I became aware of the figure of a youth about my own height, and habited in a white kerseymere morning frock, cut in the novel fashion of the one I myself wore at the moment. This the faint light enabled me to perceive; but the features of his face I could not distinguish.

<div class="line_en">Although this event failed not of a vivid effect upon my disordered imagination, yet was it evanescent as vivid. For some weeks, indeed, I busied myself in earnest inquiry, or was wrapped in a cloud of morbid speculation. I did not pretend to disguise from my perception the identity of the singular individual who thus perseveringly interfered with my affairs, and harassed me with his insinuated counsel. But who and what was this Wilson? -- and whence came he? -- and what were his purposes? Upon neither of these points could I be satisfied; merely ascertaining, in regard to him, that a sudden accident in his family had caused his removal from Dr. Bransby's academy on the afternoon of the day in which I myself had eloped. But in a brief period I ceased to think upon the subject; my attention being all absorbed in a contemplated departure for Oxford. Thither I soon went; the uncalculating vanity of my parents furnishing me with an outfit and annual establishment, which would enable me to indulge at will in the luxury already so dear to my heart, -- to vie in profuseness of expenditure with the haughtiest heirs of the wealthiest earldoms in Great Britain.</div>

<div class="line_en">Excited by such appliances to vice, my constitutional temperament broke forth with redoubled ardor, and I spurned even the common restraints of decency in the mad infatuation of my revels. But it were absurd to pause in the detail of my extravagance. Let it suffice, that among spendthrifts I out-Heroded Herod, and that, giving name to a multitude of novel follies, I added no brief appendix to the long catalogue of vices then usual in the most dissolute university of Europe.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我兴致盎然，因为我有了堕落的本钱。我的天性喷涌，且变本加厉。我拼命寻欢作乐，毫无节制，一点颜面都不顾及。如果在此细述一遍我的孟浪，那可真荒唐。我单提一笔就够了。在挥霍方面，比起希律王①，我甚至犹有过之而不及。若是将那么多新奇的勾当一并列出，那么，在这所欧洲最荒淫的大学那串长长的罪行录上，我所干的坏事就有不短的一串。【注：①希律王，耶酥诞生时的犹太王，以暴虐著称。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It could hardly be credited, however, that I had, even here, so utterly fallen from the gentlemanly estate, as to seek acquaintancewith the vilest arts of the gambler by profession, and, having become an adept in his despicable science, to practise it habitually as a means of increasing my already enormous income at the expense of the weak-minded among my fellow collegians. Such, nevertheless, was the fact. And the very enormity of this offence against all manly and honourable sentiment proved, beyond doubt, the main if not the sole reason of the impunity with which it was committed. Who, indeed, among my most abandoned associates, would not rather have disputed the clearest evidence of his senses, than have suspected of such courses, the gay, the frank, the generous William Wilson -- the noblest and most liberal commoner at Oxford -- him whose follies (said his parasites) were but the follies of youth and unbridled fancy -- whose errors but inimitable whim -- whose darkest vice but a careless and dashing extravagance?</div>

<div class="line_en">I had been now two years successfully busied in this way, when there came to the university a young parvenu nobleman, Glendinning -- rich, said report, as Herodes Atticus -- his riches, too, as easily acquired. I soon found him of weak intellect, and, of course, marked him as a fitting subject for my skill. I frequently engaged him in play, and contrived, with the gambler's usual art, to let him win considerable sums, the more effectually to entangle him in my snares. At length, my schemes being ripe, I met him (with the full intention that this meeting should be final and decisive) at the chambers of a fellow-commoner, (Mr. Preston,) equally intimate with both, but who, to do him justice, entertained not even a remote suspicion of my design. To give to this a better coloring, I had contrived to have assembled a party of some eight or ten, and was solicitously careful that the introduction of cards should appear accidental, and originate in the proposal of my contemplated dupe himself. To be brief upon a vile topic, none of the low finesse was omitted, so customary upon similar occasions that it is a just matter for wonder how any are still found so besotted as to fall its victim.</div>

<div class="line_en">We had protracted our sitting far into the night, and I had at length effected the manœuvre of getting Glendinning as my sole antagonist. The game, too, was my favorite écarté. The rest of the company, interested in the extent of our play, had abandoned their own cards, and were standing around us as spectators. Theparvenu, who had been induced by my artifices in the early part of the evening, to drink deeply, now shuffled, dealt, or played, with a wild nervousness of manner for which his intoxication, I thought, might partially, but could not altogether account. In a very short period he had become my debtor to a large amount, when, having taken a long draught of port, he did precisely what I had been coolly anticipating -- he proposed to double our already extravagant stakes. With a well-feigned show of reluctance, and not until after my repeated refusal had seduced him into some angry words which gave a color of pique to my compliance, did I finally comply. The result, of course, did but prove how entirely the prey was in my toils; in less than an hour he had quadrupled his debt. For some time his countenance had been losing the florid tinge lent it by the wine; but now, to my astonishment, I perceived that it had grown to a pallor truly fearful. I say to my astonishment. Glendinning had been represented to my eager inquiries as immeasurably wealthy; and the sums which he had as yet lost, although in themselves vast, could not, I supposed, very seriously annoy, much less so violently affect him. That he was overcome by the wine just swallowed, was the idea which most readily presented itself; and, rather with a view to the preservation of my own character in the eyes of my associates, than from any less interested motive, I was about to insist, peremptorily, upon a discontinuance of the play, when some expressions at my elbow from among the company, and an ejaculation evincing utter despair on the part of Glendinning, gave me to understand that I had effected his total ruin under circumstances which, rendering him an object for the pity of all, should have protected him from the ill offices even of a fiend.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="夜很深了，我们还没散场。最后，我的阴谋终于得逞了，葛兰丁宁成了我惟一的对手。我们玩的是我最喜欢的埃卡特①！其他人对我们一掷千金的气势大感兴趣，都扔掉自己手里的牌，站在我们旁边当了看客。这暴发户上半夜在我的诱骗下，喝了很多酒。眼下，他洗牌、发牌、打牌都紧张得要死，我想，他确实喝多了，不过也不是绝对如此。一会儿工夫，他就输给了我一大笔钱。我沉着到等着，果不其然，他灌了一大口葡萄酒后，提出将赌注再加一倍，其实原先的赌注已是个很大的数字了！我装出很勉强的样子假意推脱。我再三拒绝，把他惹恼了，对我破口大骂起来。如此，我才假装是出于怄气答应的他。当然，结果不过证明，这个猎物完全落进了我的圈套中。不到一个钟头，他的债就翻了四倍。一段时间里，他那原本喝得通红的脸上，一丝红润都不见了。让我惊讶的是，他居然面如死灰，可怕极了。我说过了，我很惊讶。我仔细调查过了，据说葛兰丁宁富得流油，他输的这笔钱在别人眼里固然不小，可是我想也不至于苦恼成这样啊，更不该反应这么激烈。一个念头闪现了：酒刚一落肚，他就醉了。我正要坚决主要不赌了——这倒不说出于无私的动机，而是为了在同伙面前保持自己的人格——忽然注意到周围人的表情，听到了葛兰丁宁万分绝望的叹息。我明白了，我已害他倾家荡产。这般境况下，大伙都同情起他来，即便是恶魔，也不会忍心对他下手。【注：①埃卡特，纸牌的一种玩法。可供两个人玩。每人各发五张牌，第十一张为王牌，满五分成一局。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">What now might have been my conduct it is difficult to say. The pitiable condition of my dupe had thrown an air of embarrassed gloom over all; and, for some moments, a profound silence was maintained, during which I could not help feeling my cheeks tingle with the many burning glances of scorn or reproach cast upon me by the less abandoned of the party. I will even own that an intolerable weight of anxiety was for a brief instant lifted from my bosom by the sudden and extraordinary interruption which ensued. The wide, heavy folding doors of the apartment were all at oncethrown open, to their full extent, with a vigorous and rushing impetuosity that extinguished, as if by magic, every candle in the room. Their light, in dying, enabled us just to perceive that a stranger had entered, about my own height, and closely muffled in a cloak. The darkness, however, was now total; and we could only feel that he was standing in our midst. Before any one of us could recover from the extreme astonishment into which this rudeness had thrown all, we heard the voice of the intruder.</div>

You are, beyond doubt, uninformed of the true character of the person who has to-night won at écarté a large sum of money from Lord Glendinning. I will therefore put you upon an expeditious and decisive plan of obtaining this very necessary information.

Can I -- shall I describe my sensations? -- must I say that I felt all the horrors of the damned? Most assuredly I had little time given for reflection. Many hands roughly seized me upon the spot, and lights were immediately reprocured. A search ensued. In the lining of my sleeve were found all the court cards essential inécarté, and, in the pockets of my wrapper, a number of packs, fac-similes of those used at our sittings, with the single exception that mine were of the species called, technically, arrondées; the honors being slightly convex at the ends, the lower cards slightly convex at the sides. In this disposition, the dupe who cuts, as customary, at the length of the pack, will invariably find that he cuts his antagonist an honor; while the gambler, cutting at the breadth, will, as certainly, cut nothing for his victim which may count in the records of the game.</div>

<div class="line_en">Abased, humbled to the dust as I then was, it is probable that I should have resented this galling language by immediate personal violence, had not my whole attention been at the moment arrested by a fact of the most startling character. The cloak which I had worn was of a rare description of fur; how rare, how extravagantly costly, I shall not venture to say. Its fashion, too, was of my own fantastic invention; for I was fastidious to an absurd degree of coxcombry, in matters of this frivolous nature. When, therefore, Mr. Preston reached me that which he had picked up upon the floor, and near the folding doors of the apartment, it was with an astonishment nearly bordering upon terror, that I perceived my own already hanging on my arm, (where I had no doubt unwittingly placed it,) and that the one presented me was but its exact counterpart in every, in even the minutest possible particular. The singular being who had so disastrously exposed me, had been muffled, I remembered, in a cloak; and none had been worn at all by any of the members of our party with the exception of myself. Retaining some presence of mind, I took the one offered me by Preston; placed it, unnoticed, over my own; left the apartment with a resolute scowl of defiance; and, next morning ere dawn of day, commenced a hurried journey from Oxford to the continent, in a perfect agony of horror and of shame.</div>

The sentiment of deep awe with which I habitually regarded the elevated character, the majestic wisdom, the apparent omnipresence and omnipotence of Wilson, added to a feeling of even terror, with which certain other traits in his nature and assumptions inspired me, had operated, hitherto, to impress me with anidea of my own utter weakness and helplessness, and to suggest an implicit, although bitterly reluctant submission to his arbitrary will. But, of late days, I had given myself up entirely to wine; and its maddening influence upon my hereditary temper rendered me more and more impatient of control. I began to murmur, -- to hesitate, -- to resist. And was it only fancy which induced me to believe that, with the increase of my own firmness, that of my tormentor underwent a proportional diminution?

I had indulged more freely than usual in the excesses of the wine-table; and now the suffocating atmosphere of the crowded rooms irritated me beyond endurance. The difficulty, too, of forcing my way through the mazes of the company contributed not a little to the ruffling of my temper; for I was anxiously seeking, (let me not say with what unworthy motive) the young, the gay, the beautiful wife of the aged and doting Di Broglio. With a too unscrupulous confidence she had previously communicated to me the secret of the costume in which she would be habited, and now, having caught a glimpse of her person, I was hurrying to make my way into her presence. -- At this moment I felt a light hand placed upon my shoulder, and that ever-remembered, low, damnable whisper within my ear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗马。18XX年。狂欢节。我去参加那不勒斯公爵德。布罗利奥府的化装舞会。我比平日里还要纵饮无度。房间里人潮滚滚，空气窒息，这让我恼火得不行。我我穿过闹哄哄的人群，费劲极了，我的火气一点都没退，因为我在寻找年老昏聩的德。布罗利奥那青春、放荡、美丽的妻子。别让我说出自己那卑鄙的动机吧。她先前就恬不知耻地私下里跟我说过，她会化装什么样子。现在，我看到她了。我马上急匆匆地朝她走去。这当口，我感到一只手轻轻搭上肩头，那难忘的、该死的低语在耳边响起。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Scoundrel!" I said, in a voice husky with rage, while every syllable I uttered seemed as new fuel to my fury, "scoundrel! impostor! accursed villain! you shall not -- you shall not dog me unto death! Follow me, or I stab you where you stand!" -- and I broke my way from the ball-room into a small ante-chamber adjoining -- dragging him unresistingly with me as I went.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“恶棍！”我叫道，愤怒得声音都哑了。每吐出一个字，怒火都要旺盛几分，“恶棍！骗子！可恶的大坏蛋！你不该——你不该这样把我缠个死！跟我来，不然我一剑刺穿你！”我拽着他就走，我们穿过人群，离开舞场，来到隔壁的小会客厅。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Upon entering, I thrust him furiously from me. He staggered against the wall, while I closed the door with an oath, and commanded him to draw. He hesitated but for an instant; then, with a slight sigh, drew in silence, and put himself upon his defence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一进屋，我就猛地把他搡了出去。他跌跌撞撞退到墙边。我骂了一句，关上了门。我让他拔出剑来。他犹豫了一会儿，然后，幽幽地叹息一声，默默拔出剑，拉开了防御的架势。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The contest was brief indeed. I was frantic with every species of wild excitement, and felt within my single arm the energy and power of a multitude. In a few seconds I forced him by sheer strength against the wainscoting, and thus, getting him at mercy, plunged my sword, with brute ferocity, repeatedly through and through his bosom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="决斗的时间实际上很短。我受了各种刺激，狂怒不已，只觉自己的一条胳膊力大无穷。几秒钟之内，我使出全部力气，把他逼到墙壁跟前。他陷入了可怜的境地。我残忍地一剑刺中他的胸口，一剑，又一剑，捅了很多下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At that instant some person tried the latch of the door. I hastened to prevent an intrusion, and then immediately returned to my dying antagonist. But what human language can adequately portray that astonishment, that horror which possessed me at the spectacle then presented to view? The brief moment in which I averted my eyes had been sufficient to produce, apparently, a material change in the arrangements at the upper or farther end of the room. A large mirror, -- so at first it seemed to me in my confusion -- now stood where none had been perceptible before; and, as I stepped up to it in extremity of terror, mine own image, but with features all pale and dabbled in blood, advanced to meet me with a feeble and tottering gait.</div>
