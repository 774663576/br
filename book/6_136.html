<div class="line_en">"I was in despair, Walter," she said. "Mr Kyrle's investigation was finished, and had shown nothing, he said. Mr Fairlie was no help at all -- I heard that he didn't even leave his room to go to the funeral! But he did show me a letter he'd received from Count Fosco, which contained news of Anne Catherick. The Count said that Anne Catherick had been found and put back in the asylum from which she had escaped. But because she hated Sir Percival and wanted to make trouble for him, she was now claiming that she was not Anne Catherick at all, but Lady Glyde. The Count warned Mr Fairlie that if she escaped again, she might try to annoy members of Lady Glyde's family.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I wasn't well enough to do anything for about a month after returning to Limmeridge, but when I felt stronger, I decided to make some investigations myself.

<div class="line_en">"Well, Walter, you can guess what's coming, I'm sure. The director of the asylum, who seemed an honest person, told me that Anne Catherick had been brought back on 27th July. He was puzzled by some odd personal changes in her, but assumed they were caused by her mental illness. He then called a nurse to take me to Anne Catherick, who was walking in the gardens.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，沃尔特，我相信你能猜到接下来发生的事情。精神病院的院长看上去是个正直的人，他告诉我，安妮·凯瑟里克是7月27日被送回来的。他对凯瑟里克身上的变化感到很困惑，但他推测是由于精神方面的疾病造成的。然后，他叫一名护士带我去见安妮·凯瑟里克，她正在花园散步。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Bribery, Walter. I didn't want to risk a legal battle and all the delay that would involve, so I persuaded the nurse that a terrible mistake had been made and she would be doing a good thing in helping Anne Catherick escape. And I offered her £400. The plan went smoothly, and by early afternoon the next day Laura and I were on the train to Cumberland."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“贿赂，沃尔特。我不想打官司，那样太冒险，也会耽误很长时间。所以，我对护士说，这里一定有严重的误会，如果她能帮助安妮·凯瑟里克逃走，就做了一件天大的好事。之后，我给了她400英镑。计划进行得很顺利，第二天刚过中午，我和劳拉就乘上了开往坎伯兰郡的火车。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"She woke up," Marian continued, "in the asylum, unable to leave, unable to make contact with the outside world. She was called by Anne Catherick's name and found she was wearing clothes with Anne Catherick's name on them. She was told Lady Glyde was dead and buried, and that she was Anne Catherick, Anne Catherick, Anne Catherick… Day in, day out, from 27th July to 15th October, she was made to feel that she was mad. It's hardly surprising her mind is so confused now."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“她醒来以后，”玛丽安接着说，“发现自己在精神病院里，既不能离开，也无法同外界接触。别人叫她安妮·凯瑟里克，她发现自己穿着有安妮·凯瑟里克名字的衣服。别人告诉她格莱德夫人已经死了，被安葬了，她就是安妮·凯瑟里克，安妮·凯瑟里克，安妮·凯瑟里克…一天又一天，从7月27日到10月15日，他们强迫她认为自己疯了。难怪现在她思维混乱。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And Laura?" I asked. "What actually happened on the day she left Blackwater Park and came to London?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那么，劳拉呢？”我问，“她离开布莱克沃特庄园到伦敦后，到底发生了什么？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Marian sighed. "Oh, Walter, it's not at all clear. Poor Laura's mind is so confused now that her memory of events is very unreliable. She can't even remember the date she left Blackwater. All she has been able to tell me is this. The Count met her at the station, and said that I was still in London and that he would take her to see me at once. She doesn't remember where the cab went, but it was clearly not to his house in St John's Wood. She was taken to a house in a narrow street, where people came and went, asking her questions she didn't understand. At this point the Count told her I was now very ill; she was so frightened by this news she nearly fainted. Someone then gave her a glass of water, which she said tasted odd -- and after that she lost consciousness."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽安叹了口气，“噢，沃尔特，现在还不清楚。可怜的劳拉思维很乱，她的记忆不可靠。她连离开布莱克沃特的日期都记不起来。她能告诉我的就是，伯爵在车站接她，告诉她我还在伦敦，他要带劳拉马上去见我。她不记得车往哪里走了，但是很明显不是去伯爵在圣约翰伍德的家。她被带进一条小巷里的一间房子，那里人来人往，问一些她听不懂的问题。这时，伯爵告诉她我病得很严重，她听了非常害怕，几乎昏了过去。接着有人给了她一杯水，她说水的味道很怪，之后她就失去了知觉。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"And what happened at Limmeridge?" I asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“在利默里奇发生了什么？”我问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Marian turned her face away. "I can't bear to think about it," she said. "The worst part was taking Laura into Mr Fairlie's room. He looked straight into Laura's face and said, "My niece is buried in Limmeridge churchyard. I don't recognize this woman. Remove her from my house before I call on the law to protect me." Even the servants were doubtful about her identity, because she was so much changed and so confused by her experiences. Perhaps people would have been persuaded if we'd stayed longer, but I didn't dare risk it. At any minute the people from the asylum might come looking for us, so I decided to return to London at once and hide. Then, as we were passing the churchyard, Laura insisted on a last look at her mother's grave. And… well, that moment changed our three lives."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽安把头转向一侧。“我简直不忍心想在那儿发生的事情。”她回答，“最糟的就是我带劳拉走进费尔利先生的房间后，他紧盯着劳拉的脸说：‘我侄女已经埋在利默里奇教堂墓地了。我不认识这个女人。赶快带她出去，不然我要用法律来保护自己了。’仆人们也对劳拉的身份很怀疑，因为她变化太大了，她的经历也让她思绪异常混乱。也许我们逗留的时间长一些，大家会被说服，但是我不想冒这个险，因为精神病院的人随时都会来找我们，所以我决定马上回伦敦躲起来。当我们经过教堂的时候，劳拉坚持要最后再看一眼她母亲的坟墓。后来…嗯，那一刻改变了我们三个人的生活。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Meanwhile, Marian and I began the battle. We studied the statements that Mr Kyrle had taken from witnesses -- the doctor, and the servants and cook in Count Fosco's house. I obtained a copy of Lady Glyde's death certificate, and Marian wrote to Mrs Michelson, who replied, saying that she could not remember the exact date of Laura's departure from Blackwater Park. Nor could she remember when the letter announcing Laura's death, which was undated, had arrived from Madame Fosco.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="与此同时，玛丽安和我开始了紧张的调查。我们仔细研究克尔先生记录的证词——分别来自医生以及伯爵家的仆人和厨师。我弄到了一份格莱德夫人的死亡证明。玛丽安给米切尔森太太写信，米切尔森太太回信说记不清劳拉离开布莱克沃特庄园的确切日期了，也记不清福斯科夫人来信通知他们劳拉死讯的具体时间了，那封信没有注明日期。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Our life quickly took on a regular pattern -- work, watching out for our enemies, and care of Laura, whom we surrounded with a gentle, protective love, helping her slowly but steadily to recover her balance of mind and her self-confidence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们的生活很快形成了一个较为固定的模式——工作，留意我们的敌人，照顾劳拉。我们细心地照顾她，保护她，帮助她慢慢地恢复正常的思维和自信心。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The plot against Laura was now clear. Anne Catherick had been taken into Count Fosco's house as Lady Glyde, and Lady Glyde had taken the dead woman's place in the asylum. It was also clear that the three of us could expect no mercy from Count Fosco and Sir Percival, who between them had gained £30,000 from the plot. They would do everything in their power to prevent their crime being discovered, and would hunt for their victim to separate her from her only friends -- Marian and myself. This is why I had chosen a poor and crowded part of London to live in. It is easier to hide in a place where people are always coming and going.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="针对劳拉的阴谋现在已经清楚了。安妮·凯瑟里克被当作格莱德夫人带进了福斯科伯爵的家里，格莱德夫人在精神病院里取代了那个已经死了的女人的位置。还有一点也很明显，福斯科伯爵和珀西瓦尔爵士是不会放过我们三个的。他们两人从这个阴谋中得到30,000英镑。他们会尽一切可能不让他们的罪行败露，也会极力追寻他们所陷害的人，并把她同她的朋友们——玛丽安和我——分开。这就是为什么我选择伦敦一处既贫穷又拥挤的地方住下来，因为在一个人来人往的地方比较容易躲藏。">查看中文翻译</div>

I accept, of course, that the identity of Lady Glyde as a living person is a proved fact to Miss Halcombe and yourself. But there is no evidence. If you could prove that the date on the death certificate was earlier than the date of Lady Glyde's journey to London, then you might have a case."</div>
