<div class="line_en">She dare not turn north onto the vast ocean of grass they called the Dothraki sea. The first khalasar they met would swallow up her ragged band, slaying the warriors and slaving the rest. The lands of the Lamb Men south of the river were likewise closed to them. They were too few to defend themselves even against that unwarlike folk, and the Lhazareen had small reason to love them. She might have struck downriver for the ports at Meereen and Yunkai and Astapor, but Rakharo warned her that Pono's khalasar had ridden that way, driving thousands of captives before them to sell in the flesh marts that festered like open sores on the shores of Slaver's Bay. "Why should I fear Pono?" Dany objected. "He was Drogo's ko, and always spoke me gently."</div>

<div class="line_en">They rode by night, and by day took refuge from the sun beneath their tents. Soon enough Dany learned the truth of Doreah's words. This was no kindly country. They left a trail of dead and dying horses behind them as they went, for Pono, Jhaqo, and the others had seized the best of Drogo's herds, leaving to Dany the old and the scrawny, the sickly and the lame, the broken animals and the ill-tempered. It was the same with the people. They are not strong, she told herself, so I must be their strength. I must show no fear, no weakness, no doubt. However frightened my heart, when they look upon my face they must see only Drogo's queen. She felt older than her fourteen years. If ever she had truly been a girl, that time was done.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dany had named him the first of her Queensguard… and when Mormont's gruff counsel and the omens agreed, her course was clear. She called her people together and mounted her silver mare. Her hair had burned away in Drogo's pyre, so her handmaids garbed her in the skin of the hrakkar Drogo had slain, the white lion of the Dothraki sea. Its fearsome head made a hood to cover her naked scalp, its pelt a cloak that flowed across her shoulders and down her back. The cream-colored dragon sunk sharp black claws into the lion's mane and coiled its tail around her arm, while Ser Jorah took his accustomed place by her side.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莫尔蒙被丹妮任命为第一个“女王铁卫”…既然他的意见和预兆相符，那她的方向也就明确了。于是她召集子民，骑上银马。她的头发已在卓戈的火葬堆里焚尽，所以女仆为她戴上“赫拉卡”——卓戈在多斯拉克海上捕杀的白狮——的毛皮，骇人的狮首正好形成兜帽，遮盖她的光头，狮皮则成了天然披风，从肩头垂下背部。那只乳黄色的龙偎在她身边，伸出黑色利爪，深深陷进狮鬃，尾巴则缠绕她的手臂。乔拉爵士一如往常，骑马不离左右。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Three days into the march, the first man died. A toothless oldster with cloudy blue eyes, he fell exhausted from his saddle and could not rise again. An hour later he was done. Blood flies swarmed about his corpse and carried his ill luck to the living. "His time was past," her handmaid Irri declared. "No man should live longer than his teeth." The others agreed. Dany bid them kill the weakest of their dying horses, so the dead man might go mounted into the night lands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="行至第三天，便有人倒下。一位有着蒙昧蓝眼，牙齿掉光的老人，力竭落马，无法起身，一小时后断了气。血蝇围绕尸体，将他的恶运传给世人。“他的时辰已到，”女仆伊丽宣布，“任何人都不该活得比自己的牙齿更久。”余人纷纷赞同。丹妮吩咐他们杀死一匹虚弱濒死的马儿，好让死者骑着进入夜晚的国度。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was little forage in the red waste, and less water. It was a sere and desolate land of low hills and barren windswept plains. The rivers they crossed were dry as dead men's bones. Their mounts subsisted on the tough brown devilgrass that grew in clumps at the base of rocks and dead trees. Dany sent outriders ranging ahead of the column, but they found neither wells nor springs, only bitter pools, shallow and stagnant, shrinking in the hot sun. The deeper they rode into the waste, the smaller the pools became, while the distance between them grew. If there were gods in this trackless wilderness of stone and sand and red clay, they were hard dry gods, deaf to prayers for rain.</div>

The milk in her breasts dried up, her nipples cracked and bled, and the flesh fell away from her day by day until she was lean and hard as a stick, yet it was her dragons she feared for. Her father had been slain before she was born, and her splendid brother Rhaegar as well. Her mother had died bringing her into the world while the storm screamed outside. Gentle Ser Willem Darry, who must have loved her after a fashion, had been taken by a wasting sickness when she was very young. Her brother Viserys, Khal Drogo who was her sun-and-stars, even her unborn son, the gods had claimed them all. They will not have my dragons, Dany vowed. They will not.</div>

<div class="line_en">When she had her handmaids char the horsemeat black, the dragons ripped at it eagerly, their heads striking like snakes. So long as the meat was seared, they gulped down several times their own weight every day, and at last began to grow larger and stronger. Dany marveled at the smoothness of their scales, and the heat that poured off them, so palpable that on cold nights their whole bodies seemed to steam.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是她吩咐女仆把肉烤焦，小龙见状立刻急切争食，头像蛇一般窜动抢夺。从此，只要肉是烧过的，他们便每日吞下数倍体重的份量，终于渐渐茁壮。丹妮对他们光滑的鳞片颇感惊奇，龙鳞还会散发热气，到了寒冷的夜里尤其明显，彷佛全身都在冒烟。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The dragons were no larger than the scrawny cats she had once seen skulking along the walls of Magister Illyrio's estate in Pentos… until they unfolded their wings. Their span was three times their length, each wing a delicate fan of translucent skin, gorgeously colored, stretched taut between long thin bones. When you looked hard, you could see that most of their body was neck, tail, and wing. Such little things, she thought as she fed them by hand. Or rather, tried to feed them, for the dragons would not eat. They would hiss and spit at each bloody morsel of horsemeat, steam rising from their nostrils, yet they would not take the food… until Dany recalled something Viserys had told her when they were children.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从前在潘托斯，她在伊利里欧总督的宅院里见过在墙边潜行的小猫，骨瘦如柴，她的龙现在就和它们差不多…可是张开翅膀就不同了，他们翼展是身长的三倍，每一只翅膀都是一片半透明的精巧皮肤，色彩斑斓，紧致地张在长长的细骨之间。倘若仔细观察，你会发现幼龙的身躯基本由脖颈、尾巴和翅膀组成。他们好小啊，她一边用手给他们喂食，心里一边想。其实应该说是“试图”喂食，因为小龙不肯吃东西。他们一见血红的马肉片，便嘶叫吐气，鼻子喷出热气，就是不肯进食…后来，丹妮想起小时候韦赛里斯说过的话。">查看中文翻译</div>

"Visenya's dragon was Vhagar, Rhaenys had Meraxes, and Aegon rode Balerion, the Black Dread. It was said that Vhagar's breath was so hot that it could melt a knight's armor and cook the man inside, that Meraxes swallowed horses whole, and Balerion… his fire was as black as his scales, his wings so vast that whole towns were swallowed up in their shadow when he passed overhead."</div>

Even devilgrass grew scant; horses dropped in their tracks, leaving so few that some of her people must trudge along on foot. Doreah took a fever and grew worse with every league they crossed. Her lips and hands broke with blood blisters, her hair came out in clumps, and one evenfall she lacked the strength to mount her horse. Jhogo said they must leave her or bind her to her saddle, but Dany remembered a night on the Dothraki sea, when the Lysene girl had taught her secrets so that Drogo might love her more. She gave Doreah water from her own skin, cooled her brow with a damp cloth, and held her hand until she died, shivering. Only then would she permit the khalasar to press on.</div>

<div class="line_en">The next pool they found was scalding hot and stinking of brimstone, but their skins were almost empty. The Dothraki cooled the water in jars and pots and drank it tepid. The taste was no less foul, but water was water, and all of them thirsted. Dany looked at the horizon with despair. They had lost a third of their number, and still the waste stretched before them, bleak and red and endless. The comet mocks my hopes, she thought, lifting her eyes to where it scored the sky. Have I crossed half the world and seen the birth of dragons only to die with them in this hard hot desert? She would not believe it.</div>

<div class="line_en">They made camp before the remnants of a gutted palace, on a windswept plaza where devilgrass grew between the paving stones. Dany sent out men to search the ruins. Some went reluctantly, yet they went… and one scarred old man returned a brief time later, hopping and grinning, his hands overflowing with figs.

<div class="line_en">How long the city had been deserted she could not know, but the white walls, so beautiful from afar, were cracked and crumbling when seen up close. Inside was a maze of narrow crooked alleys. The buildings pressed close, their facades blank, chalky, windowless. Everything was white, as if the people who lived here had known nothing of color. They rode past heaps of sun-washed rubble where houses had fallen in, and elsewhere saw the faded scars of fire. At a place where six alleys came together, Dany passed an empty marble plinth. Dothraki had visited this place before, it would seem. Perhaps even now the missing statue stood among the other stolen gods in Vaes Dothrak. She might have ridden past it a hundred times, never knowing. On her shoulder, Viserion hissed.</div>

Aggo showed her a courtyard overgrown with twisting vines and tiny green grapes, and Jhogo discovered a well where the water was pure and cold.

Dothraki men wore their hair in long oiled braids, and cut them only when defeated. Perhaps I should do the same, she thought, to remind them that Drogo's strength lives within me now.

<div class="line_en">Across the tent, Rhaegal unfolded green wings to flap and flutter a half foot before thumping to the carpet. When he landed, his tail lashed back and forth in fury, and he raised his head and screamed. If I had wings, I would want to fly too, Dany thought. The Targaryens of old had ridden upon dragonback when they went to war. She tried to imagine what it would feel like, to straddle a dragon's neck and soar high into the air. It would be like standing on a mountaintop, only better. The whole world would be spread out below. If I flew high enough, I could even see the Seven Kingdoms, and reach up and touch the comet.</div>

Goldsmiths, jewelers, dressmakers, whatever she wanted I found for her, but it was never enough. Bear Island is rich in bears and trees, and poor in aught else. I built a fine ship for her and we sailed to Lannisport and Oldtown for festivals and fairs, and once even to Braavos, where I borrowed heavily from the moneylenders. It was as a tourney champion that I had won her hand and heart, so I entered other tourneys for her sake, but the magic was gone. I never distinguished myself again, and each defeat meant the loss of another charger and another suit of jousting armor, which must needs be ransomed or replaced. The cost could not be borne. Finally I insisted we return home, but there matters soon grew even worse than before. I could no longer pay the cook and the harper, and Lynesse grew wild when I spoke of pawning her jewels.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我活着，只希望见她开心，所以我大老远从旧镇聘来一个新厨子，又从兰尼斯港找来一位竖琴手。金匠、珠宝匠、服装师，她要什么我都成全，却怎么也不够。熊岛盛产野熊和木材，此外的资源却相当匮乏。我造了一艘大船，与她航至兰尼斯港和旧镇，四处参加节庆和宴会，有一次甚至远达布拉佛斯，我在那里借了巨款。当初我是以比武冠军的身份赢得了她的欢笑和芳心，因此我为了她继续参加比武大会，然而魔力不再，我竟再也没有赢过。每次落败，便意味着一匹战马和一套盔甲的损失，必须花钱赎回，或重置新品。这样的开销我实在受不了，最后终于坚持回家去，但回家之后情况却越来越糟。我付不出厨子和竖琴手的薪水，而琳妮丝一听说我有意典当她的珠宝，便暴跳如雷。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dany shivered, and pulled the lionskin tight about her. She looked like me. It explained much that she had not truly understood. He wants me, she realized. He loves me as he loved her, not as a knight loves his queen but as a man loves a woman. She tried to imagine herself in Ser Jorah's arms, kissing him, pleasuring him, letting him enter her. It was no good. When she closed her eyes, his face kept changing into Drogo's.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“卡丽熙，您要我们去找什么？”乔戈问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Whatever there is," Dany answered. "Seek for other cities, living and dead. Seek for caravans and people. Seek for rivers and lakes and the great salt sea.

I will know where I am bound, and how best to get there."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“什么都好，”丹妮回答，“去找其他的城市，活城或死城。去找商旅和人迹，去找河流、湖泊和咸水汪洋。查出荒原的尽头，以及荒原之外的景象。等我再次出发，我绝不再盲目前进，我不但要明确目的地，还要知道抵达该处的捷径。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The next morn, she summoned her bloodriders. "Blood of my blood," she told the three of them, "I have need of you. Each of you is to choose three horses, the hardiest and healthiest that remain to us. Load as much water and food as your mounts can bear, and ride forth for me. Aggo shall strike southwest, Rakharo due south. Jhogo, you are to follow shierak qiya on southeast."</div>

<div class="line_en">And so they went, the bells in their hair ringing softly, while Dany settled down with her small band of survivors in the place they named Vaes Tolorro, the city of bones. Day followed night followed day. Women harvested fruit from the gardens of the dead. Men groomed their mounts and mended saddles, stirrups, and shoes. Children wandered the twisty alleys and found old bronze coins and bits of purple glass and stone flagons with handles carved like snakes. One woman was stung by a red scorpion, but hers was the only death. The horses began to put on some flesh. Dany tended Ser Jorah's wound herself, and it began to heal.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是他们领命离去，发际铃铛轻声作响。丹妮则带着她那一小群追随者在这个他们称为“维斯·托罗若”，意思是“枯骨之城”的地方安顿下来。日夜交替，女人在死者的花园里采收果实，男人则喂养马匹，修补鞍辔、马镫和蹄铁。孩童在曲折的巷道中漫游，发掘出古老的青铜钱币和紫色的玻璃片，还有手把如蛇的石瓶。曾有一名妇人被红蝎咬伤，但除她之外无人丧命。马儿逐渐茁壮，在丹妮的亲自照料下，乔拉爵士的伤也慢慢愈合。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dany gave him charge of a dozen of her strongest men, and set them to pulling up the plaza to get to the earth beneath. If devilgrass could grow between the paving stones, other grasses would grow when the stones were gone. They had wells enough, no lack of water. Given seed, they could make the plaza bloom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随后丹妮交给他十二名壮丁，命他们翻掘广场地面，挖出下面的泥土。既然恶魔草能在石板夹缝间存活，那么除去石块后，其他植物想必也可以在此生长。他们找到了好多井，因此水源不虞匮乏，只要播下种子，便可使广场焕然一新。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Rakharo was the first to return. Due south the red waste stretched on and on, he reported, until it ended on a bleak shore beside the poison water. Between here and there lay only swirling sand, wind-scoured rocks, and plants bristly with sharp thorns. He had passed the bones of a dragon, he swore, so immense that he had ridden his horse through its great black jaws. Other than that, he had seen nothing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拉卡洛首先归来。据他报告，红色荒原往南不断延伸，尽头是毒水之滨的贫瘠崖岸。毒水与此地间只有滚滚红沙，饱经风蚀的岩块，以及长满尖刺的植物。他发誓，自己曾行经巨龙的遗骸，黑色的龙口大得可以容他骑马穿过。除此之外，什么也没发现。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Aggo was back next. The southwest was barren and burnt, he swore. He had found the ruins of two more cities, smaller than Vaes Tolorro but otherwise the same. One was warded by a ring of skulls mounted on rusted iron spears, so he dared not enter, but he had explored the second for as long as he could. He showed Dany an iron bracelet he had found, set with a uncut fire opal the size of her thumb. There were scrolls as well, but they were dry and crumbling and Aggo had left them where they lay.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二个回来的是阿戈。他誓言西南地区烈日炎炎，一片荒漠。他找到了两座城市的遗迹，和维斯·托罗若相比，除了规模较小，并无太大差异。其中一座城周围有生锈铁枪环绕，枪尖挂着骷髅，所以他不敢冒进，但他仔细探索了另外一座死城。他向丹妮展示了在里面发现的一个铁手环，上嵌一个大如拇指的火红蛋白石，浑然天成，未经雕琢。此外他还找到一些卷轴，不过多半干燥脆弱，所以阿戈没有带回来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jhogo was gone so long that Dany feared him lost, but finally when they had all but ceased to look for him, he came riding up from the southeast. One of the guards that Aggo had posted saw him first and gave a shout, and Dany rushed to the walls to see for herself. It was true. Jhogo came, yet not alone. Behind him rode three queerly garbed strangers atop ugly humped creatures that dwarfed any horse.</div>
