<div class="line_en">The Water Rat was restless, and he did not exactly know why. To all appearance the summer's pomp was still at fullest height, and although in the tilled acres green had given way to gold, though rowans were reddening, and the woods were dashed here and there with a tawny fierceness, yet light and warmth and colour were still present in undiminished measure, clean of any chilly premonitions of the passing year. But the constant chorus of the orchards and hedges had shrunk to a casual evensong from a few yet unwearied performers; the robin was beginning to assert himself once more; and there was a feeling in the air of change and departure. The cuckoo, of course, had long been silent; but many another feathered friend, for months a part of the familiar landscape and its small society, was missing too and it seemed that the ranks thinned steadily day by day. Rat, ever observant of all winged movement, saw that it was taking daily a southing tendency; and even as he lay in bed at night he thought he could make out, passing in the darkness overhead, the beat and quiver of impatient pinions, obedient to the peremptory call.</div>

<div class="line_en">Nature's Grand Hotel has its Season, like the others. As the guests one by one pack, pay, and depart, and the seats at the table-d'hote shrink pitifully at each succeeding meal; as suites of rooms are closed, carpets taken up, and waiters sent away; those boarders who are staying on, en pension, until the next year's full re-opening, cannot help being somewhat affected by all these flittings and farewells, this eager discussion of plans, routes, and fresh quarters, this daily shrinkage in the stream of comradeship. One gets unsettled, depressed, and inclined to be querulous. Why this craving for change? Why not stay on quietly here, like us, and be jolly? You don't know this hotel out of the season, and what fun we have among ourselves, we fellows who remain and see the whole interesting year out. All very true, no doubt the others always reply; we quite envy you-and some other year perhaps-but just now we have engagements -- and there's the bus at the door-our time is up! So they depart, with a smile and a nod, and we miss them, and feel resentful. The Rat was a self-sufficing sort of animal, rooted to the land, and, whoever went, he stayed; still, he could not help noticing what was in the air, and feeling some of its influence in his bones.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was difficult to settle down to anything seriously, with all this flitting going on. Leaving the water-side, where rushes stood thick and tall in a stream that was becoming sluggish and low, he wandered country-wards, crossed a field or two of pasturage already looking dusty and parched, and thrust into the great sea of wheat, yellow, wavy, and murmurous, full of quiet motion and small whisperings. Here he often loved to wander, through the forest of stiff strong stalks that carried their own golden sky away over his head-a sky that was always dancing, shimmering, softly talking; or swaying strongly to the passing wind and recovering itself with a toss and a merry laugh. Here, too, he had many small friends, a society complete in itself, leading full and busy lives, but always with a spare moment to gossip, and exchange news with a visitor. Today, however, though they were civil enough, the field-mice and harvest-mice seemed preoccupied. Many were digging and tunnelling busily; others, gathered together in small groups, examined plans and drawings of small flats, stated to be desirable and compact, and situated conveniently near the Stores. Some were hauling out dusty trunks and dress-baskets, others were already elbow-deep packing their belongings; while everywhere piles and bundles of wheat, oats, barley, beech-mast and nuts, lay about ready for transport.</div>

For a few weeks it was all well enough, but afterwards, O the weary length of the nights! The shivering, sunless days! The air so clammy and chill, and not an insect in an acre of it! No, it was no good; my courage broke down, and one cold, stormy night I took wing, flying well inland on account of the strong easterly gales. It was snowing hard as I beat through the passes of the great mountains, and I had a stiff fight to win through; but never shall I forget the blissful feeling of the hot sun again on my back as I sped down to the lakes that lay so blue and placid below me, and the taste of my first fat insect! The past was like a bad dream; the future was all happy holiday as I moved southwards week by week, easily, lazily, lingering as long as I dared, but always heeding the call! No, I had had my warning; never again did I think of disobedience.'</div>

<div class="line_en">'Ah, yes, the call of the South, of the South!' twittered the other two dreamily. 'Its songs its hues, its radiant air! O, do you remember --' and, forgetting the Rat, they slid into passionate reminiscence, while he listened fascinated, and his heart burned within him. In himself, too, he knew that it was vibrating at last, that chord hitherto dormant and unsuspected. The mere chatter of these southern-bound birds, their pale and second-hand reports, had yet power to awaken this wild new sensation and thrill him through and through with it; what would one moment of the real thing work in him -- one passionate touch of the real southern sun, one waft of the authentic odor? With closed eyes he dared to dream a moment in full abandonment, and when he looked again the river seemed steely and chill, the green fields grey and lightless. Then his loyal heart seemed to cry out on his weaker self for its treachery.</div>

<div class="line_en">Restlessly the Rat wandered off once more, climbed the slope that rose gently from the north bank of the river, and lay looking out towards the great ring of Downs that barred his vision further southwards-his simple horizon hitherto, his Mountains of the Moon, his limit behind which lay nothing he had cared to see or to know. To-day, to him gazing South with a new-born need stirring in his heart, the clear sky over their long low outline seemed to pulsate with promise; to-day, the unseen was everything, the unknown the only real fact of life. On this side of the hills was now the real blank, on the other lay the crowded and coloured panorama that his inner eye was seeing so clearly. What seas lay beyond, green, leaping, and crested! What sun-bathed coasts, along which the white villas glittered against the olive woods! What quiet harbours, thronged with gallant shipping bound for purple islands of wine and spice, islands set low in languorous waters!</div>

<div class="line_en">Footsteps fell on his ear, and the figure of one that walked somewhat wearily came into view; and he saw that it was a Rat, and a very dusty one. The wayfarer, as he reached him, saluted with a gesture of courtesy that had something foreign about it-hesitated a moment-then with a pleasant smile turned from the track and sat down by his side in the cool herbage. He seemed tired, and the Rat let him rest unquestioned, understanding something of what was in his thoughts; knowing, too, the value all animals attach at times to mere silent companionship, when the weary muscles slacken and the mind marks time.</div>

There, lying half-buried in the thick, cool under-hedge tangle that bordered it, he could muse on the metalled road and all the wondrous world that it led to; on all the wayfarers, too, that might have trodden it, and the fortunes and adventures they had gone to seek or found unseeking-out there, beyond-beyond!</div>

A fair city, and an ancient and glorious one. And you may have heard, too, of Sigurd, King of Norway, and how he sailed thither with sixty ships, and how he and his men rode up through streets all canopied in their honour with purple and gold; and how the Emperor and Empress came down and banqueted with him on board his ship. When Sigurd returned home, many of his Northmen remained behind and entered the Emperor's body-guard, and my ancestor, a Norwegian born, stayed behind too, with the ships that Sigurd gave the Emperor. Seafarers we have ever been, and no wonder; as for me, the city of my birth is no more my home than any pleasant port between there and the London River. I know them all, and they know me.

<div class="line_en">'My last voyage,' began the Sea Rat, 'that landed me eventually in this country, bound with high hopes for my inland farm, will serve as a good example of any of them, and, indeed, as an epitome of my highly-coloured life. Family troubles, as usual, began it. The domestic storm-cone was hoisted, and I shipped myself on board a small trading vessel bound from Constantinople, by classic seas whose every wave throbs with a deathless memory, to the Grecian Islands and the Levant. Those were golden days and balmy nights! In and out of harbour all the time-old friends everywhere-sleeping in some cool temple or ruined cistern during the heat of the day-feasting and song after sundown, under great stars set in a velvet sky! Thence we turned and coasted up the Adriatic, its shores swimming in an atmosphere of amber, rose, and aquamarine; we lay in wide land-locked harbours, we roamed through ancient and noble cities, until at last one morning, as the sun rose royally behind us, we rode into Venice down a path of gold. O, Venice is a fine city, wherein a rat can wander at his ease and take his pleasure! Or, when weary of wandering, can sit at the edge of the Grand Canal at night, feasting with his friends, when the air is full of music and the sky full of stars, and the lights flash and shimmer on the polished steel prows of the swaying gondolas, packed so that you could walk across the canal on them from side to side! And then the food-do you like shellfish? Well, well, we won't linger over that now.' He was silent for a time; and the Water Rat, silent too and enthralled, floated on dream-canals and heard a phantom song pealing high between vaporous grey wave-lapped walls.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我上次出海，”海上老鼠说开了。“是希望办一处内陆农庄，于是我就登上了这片国土。这次航海，可以看作是我历次航海的一个例证，确实也是我丰富多采的生活的一个缩影。开头，照例是由家庭纠纷引起的。家务风暴的警钟敲响了，我就乘上一艘小商船，由君士坦丁堡启航，驶入古代世界的海洋，朝着希腊群岛和东地中海行进，海上的每一个浪头都荡漾着令人难忘的回忆。那些日子，白天阳光灿烂，夜间和风习习。船不停地进港出港，到处都遇到老朋友。在炎热的白天，我们睡在阴凉的庙宇或废水池里，太阳落山后，就在嵌满星星的天鹅绒般的天幕下，纵情饮宴，放声高歌！从那里，我们又转向亚德里亚海沿岸；那里的海岸弥漫着琥珀色、玫瑰色、蓝晶色的空气。我们碇泊在陆地环抱的宽阔的港湾里，我们在古老而豪华的城市里游逛。末了，有一天早晨，我们顺着一条金灿灿的航道驶进了威尼斯。威尼斯真是一座美丽的城市啊！在那里，老鼠可以自由自在地溜达闲逛，尽情玩乐！要是游倦了，晚上可以坐在大运河边，和朋友们一道吃喝。那时，空中乐声悠扬，头上一天繁星，河里满是摇摆的游艇，船头熠熠发亮，一只只游艇紧紧挨着，你都能踩着它们丛一岸走到另一岸！说到吃的，你喜欢吃贝吗？得，得，那个，咱们现在还是少谈为妙。”他沉默了一阵；河鼠也默不作声。他听得入了迷，仿佛乘上一只梦中游艇漂呀漂，听到一首高亢的魔歌，在雾气蒙蒙、波浪拍击的河墙之间回响。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'By no means,' said the Sea Rat frankly. 'Such a life as you describe would not suit me at all. I'm in the coasting trade, and rarely out of sight of land. It's the jolly times on shore that appeal to me, as much as any seafaring. O, those southern seaports! The smell of them, the riding-lights at night, the glamour!'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“根本不是这样，”航海鼠坦白地说。“你说的那种生活对我也不适合。我只是做海岸营生，很少离开陆地。吸引我的是岸上的快乐时光，和航海一样。南方的那些海港，它们的气味，夜晚的那些停泊灯，多么令人神往啊！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">'For the crew it is,' replied the seafarer gravely, again with the ghost of a wink.'From Corsica,' he went on, 'I made use of a ship that was taking wine to the mainland. We made Alassio in the evening, lay to, hauled up our wine-casks, and hove them overboard, tied one to the other by a long line. Then the crew took to the boats and rowed shorewards, singing as they went, and drawing after them the long bobbing procession of casks, like a mile of porpoises. On the sands they had horses waiting, which dragged the casks up the steep street of the little town with a fine rush and clatter and scramble. When the last cask was in, we went and refreshed and rested, and sat late into the night, drinking with our friends, and next morning I took to the great olive-woods for a spell and a rest. For now I had done with islands for the time, and ports and shipping were plentiful; so I led a lazy life among the peasants, lying and watching them work, or stretched high on the hillside with the blue Mediterranean far below me. And so at length, by easy stages, and partly on foot, partly by sea, to Marseilles, and the meeting of old shipmates, and the visiting of great ocean-bound vessels, and feasting once more. Talk of shell-fish! Why, sometimes I dream of the shell-fish of Marseilles, and wake up crying!'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对于水手来说是艰苦的，”航海鼠严肃地说，若有若无地又眨了一下眼睛，“在科西加，我搭上一艘运葡萄酒去大陆的船，”航海鼠接着说。“傍晚时我们到达阿拉西奥，船驶进港口。我们把酒桶抬起，扔下船去，用一根长绳把酒桶一个个连结起来，然后水手乘上小艇，朝岸边划去，一边唱歌，小艇后面拖着一长串上下漂浮的酒桶，像一哩路长的一串海豚。河滩上，有马匹等着，马拉着酒桶，叮叮咚咚冲上小镇陡峭的街道。运完最后一桶酒，我们就打个尖，歇一会儿，晚上和朋友们一道喝酒，直到深夜。第二天早上，我就到大橄榄林里去呆上一段时间，好好休息。这时我已经暂时不去海岛，不过还常同海港和航行打交道。所以我在农人当中过着懒散的生活，躺着看他们干活，或者伸长四肢躺在高高的山坡上，远在脚下就是蔚蓝的地中海。于是，我就这样轻轻松松，一程又一程，或步行，或乘船，最终来到了马赛，会见了同船的老伙伴，访问了远洋巨轮，又一次吃喝饮宴。这不是又谈到鲜贝了！是啊，有时我做梦梦见马赛的鲜贝，竟哭醒了！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'Southwards we sailed again at last,' continued the Sea Rat, 'coasting down the Italian shore, till finally we made Palermo, and there I quitted for a long, happy spell on shore. I never stick too long to one ship; one gets narrow-minded and prejudiced. Besides, Sicily is one of my happy hunting-grounds. I know everybody there, and their ways just suit me. I spent many jolly weeks in the island, staying with friends up country. When I grew restless again I took advantage of a ship that was trading to Sardinia and Corsica; and very glad I was to feel the fresh breeze and the sea-spray in my face once more.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“然后我们又向南驶去，”海上老鼠接着说，“沿着意大利的海岸航行，来到巴勒摩。在那儿，我离船上岸，逗留了很长一段快乐时光。我从不死守住一条船；那会使人变得头脑闭塞，思想偏颇。再说，西西里岛是我爱去的一个地方。那里的人我都认识，他们的风尚很合我的口味。我在岛上和朋友们一道，在乡间愉快地过了好几个星期。等到我呆腻了，我就搭上一艘驶向萨丁尼亚和科西加的商船。我又一次感到新鲜的海风和浪沫扑打在脸上，好不惬意。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">By this time their meal was over, and the Seafarer, refreshed and strengthened, his voice more vibrant, his eye lit with a brightness that seemed caught from some far-away sea-beacon, filled his glass with the red and glowing vintage of the South, and, leaning towards the Water Rat, compelled his gaze and held him, body and soul, while he talked. Those eyes were of the changing foam-streaked grey-green of leaping Northern seas; in the glass shone a hot ruby that seemed the very heart of the South, beating for him who had courage to respond to its pulsation. The twin lights, the shifting grey and the steadfast red, mastered the Water Rat and held him bound, fascinated, powerless. The quiet world outside their rays receded far away and ceased to be. And the talk, the wonderful talk flowed on-or was it speech entirely, or did it pass at times into song-chanty of the sailors weighing the dripping anchor, sonorous hum of the shrouds in a tearing North-Easter, ballad of the fisherman hauling his nets at sundown against an apricot sky, chords of guitar and mandoline from gondola or caique? Did it change into the cry of the wind, plaintive at first, angrily shrill as it freshened, rising to a tearing whistle, sinking to a musical trickle of air from the leech of the bellying sail? All these sounds the spell-bound listener seemed to hear, and with them the hungry complaint of the gulls and the sea-mews, the soft thunder of the breaking wave, the cry of the protesting shingle.</div>

<div class="line_en">Lastly, in his waking dream it seemed to him that the Adventurer had risen to his feet, but was still speaking, still holding him fast with his sea-grey eyes.'And now,' he was softly saying, 'I take to the road again, holding on southwestwards for many a long and dusty day; till at last I reach the little grey sea town I know so well, that clings along one steep side of the harbour. There through dark doorways you look down flights of stone steps, overhung by great pink tufts of valerian and ending in a patch of sparkling blue water. The little boats that lie tethered to the rings and stanchions of the old sea-wall are gaily painted as those I clambered in and out of in my own childhood; the salmon leap on the flood tide, schools of mackerel flash and play past quay-sides and foreshores, and by the windows the great vessels glide, night and day, up to their moorings or forth to the open sea. There, sooner or later, the ships of all seafaring nations arrive; and there, at its destined hour, the ship of my choice will let go its anchor. I shall take my time, I shall tarry and bide, till at last the right one lies waiting for me, warped out into midstream, loaded low, her bowsprit pointing down harbour. I shall slip on board, by boat or along hawser; and then one morning I shall wake to the song and tramp of the sailors, the clink of the capstan, and the rattle of the anchor-chain coming merrily in. We shall break out the jib and the foresail, the white houses on the harbour side will glide slowly past us as she gathers steering-way, and the voyage will have begun! As she forges towards the headland she will clothe herself with canvas; and then, once outside, the sounding slap of great green seas as she heels to the wind, pointing South!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后来，河鼠在白日梦里仿佛看到，探险鼠已经站起身来，但仍在说个不停，那双海灰色的眸子仍旧紧紧盯着他。“现在，”他轻轻地说：“我又上路了，朝着西南方向，风尘仆仆地一连走许多天，直到到达我熟悉的那个坐落在海港峭壁上的灰黄色滨海小镇……在那儿，从昏暗的门道向下望去，可以看到一行石阶，上面覆盖着长长的粉红色缬草，石阶的尽头，便是蓝莹莹的海水。古老的海堤上的铁环或桩柱上，系着一些小艇，漆成鲜艳的色调，跟我小时候常爬进爬出的那些小艇一个样。涨潮时，鲑鱼随波跳跃，一群群的鲭鱼银光闪闪，欢蹦嬉戏，游过码头和海滩边。巨轮日夜不停地在窗前徐徐滑过，驶向碇泊处或大海。所有的航海国家的船只，早晚都要抵达那里，在一定的时辰，我选中的那条船就会抛锚。我不急于上船，而是静候时机，直到我相中的那条船驶进河中央，载满了货，船首朝向海港时，我才乘小艇或攀着缆索悄悄溜上船去。于是早晨一觉醒来，我就会听到水手的歌声和沉重的脚步声，绞盘的嘎吱声，还有收锚索时欢快的哐啷声。我们扯起船首三角帆和前桅帆。船离岸时，港边的白色房屋就从我们身边慢慢滑开，航海就此开始！当船向海岬缓缓驶去时，她全身披满了白帆；一到外海，她便迎着汪洋大海的万顷碧波，乘风破浪，直指南方！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Back into speech again it passed, and with beating heart he was following the adventures of a dozen seaports, the fights, the escapes, the rallies, the comradeships, the gallant undertakings; or he searched islands for treasure, fished in still lagoons and dozed day-long on warm white sand. Of deep-sea fishings he heard tell, and mighty silver gatherings of the mile-long net; of sudden perils, noise of breakers on a moonless night, or the tall bows of the great liner taking shape overhead through the fog; of the merry home-coming, the headland rounded, the harbour lights opened out; the groups seen dimly on the quay, the cheery hail, the splash of the hawser; the trudge up the steep little street towards the comforting glow of red-curtained windows.</div>

<div class="line_en">'Going South, with the rest of them,' murmured the Rat in a dreamy monotone, never looking at him. 'Seawards first and then on shipboard, and so to the shores that are calling me!' He pressed resolutely forward, still without haste, but with dogged fixity of purpose; but the Mole, now thoroughly alarmed, placed himself in front of him, and looking into his eyes saw that they were glazed and set and turned a streaked and shifting grey-not his friend's eyes, but the eyes of some other animal! Grappling with him strongly he dragged him inside, threw him down, and held him.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Rat struggled desperately for a few moments, and then his strength seemed suddenly to leave him, and he lay still and exhausted, with closed eyes, trembling. Presently the Mole assisted him to rise and placed him in a chair, where he sat collapsed and shrunken into himself, his body shaken by a violent shivering, passing in time into an hysterical fit of dry sobbing. Mole made the door fast, threw the satchel into a drawer and locked it, and sat down quietly on the table by his friend, waiting for the strange seizure to pass. Gradually the Rat sank into a troubled doze, broken by starts and confused murmurings of things strange and wild and foreign to the unenlightened Mole; and from that he passed into a deep slumber.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="河鼠拼命挣扎了一阵，然后。像是突然间泄了气，躺着一动不动，虚乏无力，闭着眼睛，直打哆嗦。鼹鼠随即扶他起来，坐在椅子上。他全身瘫软，蜷缩成一团，身子剧烈地抽搐，过后，爆发出一阵歇斯底里的干嚎。鼹鼠关紧了门，把背包扔进一个抽屉，锁好，然后静静地坐在朋友身边的桌子上，等着这阵奇怪的邪魔过去。渐渐地，河鼠沉入了惊悸不宁的浅睡，间或惊醒过来，嘴里面咕哝着，在懵懂的鼹鼠听来，全是些荒诞不经的异国事情。过后，河鼠就睡熟了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Poor Ratty did his best, by degrees, to explain things; but how could he put into cold words what had mostly been suggestion? How recall, for another's benefit, the haunting sea voices that had sung to him, how reproduce at second-hand the magic of the Seafarer's hundred reminiscences? Even to himself, now the spell was broken and the glamour gone, he found it difficult to account for what had seemed, some hours ago, the inevitable and only thing. It is not surprising, then, that he failed to convey to the Mole any clear idea of what he had been through that day.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可怜的河鼠竭力一桩桩一件件作着解释：可是那些多半属暗示性的东西，他用冷冰冰的语言又怎么说得清呢？他怎能对另一个人复述那曾经向他歌唱的迷人的海声，又怎能再现航海鼠的千百种往事的魔力？现在魔法已破，魅力消失了，几小时前那似乎是不可避免的天经地义的事情；连他自己也很难解释了。所以，他没能使鼹鼠明白他那天的经历，就不奇怪了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Very anxious in mind, the Mole left him for a time and busied himself with household matters; and it was getting dark when he returned to the parlour and found the Rat where he had left him, wide awake indeed, but listless, silent, and dejected.

<div class="line_en">To the Mole this much was plain: the fit, or attack, had passed away, and had left him sane again, though shaken and cast down by the reaction.

<div class="line_cn" title="对鼹鼠来说，有一点是显而易见的，就是那阵狂热病，尽管使河鼠受到打击，情绪低落，但终究已经过去，他又清醒过来了。一时间，他似乎对日常生活中那些琐事没了兴趣，对季节变换必然带来的变化和活动，也无心去作安排了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Casually, then, and with seeming indifference, the Mole turned his talk to the harvest that was being gathered in, the towering wagons and their straining teams, the growing ricks, and the large moon rising over bare acres dotted with sheaves. He talked of the reddening apples around, of the browning nuts, of jams and preserves and the distilling of cordials; till by easy stages such as these he reached midwinter, its hearty joys and its snug home life, and then he became simply lyrical.</div>
