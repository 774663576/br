<div class="line_en">Tristan stood immobilised for a moment, but then wrapped his arms around her and squeezed her tightly to him. He rubbed her back with one hand as she continued to cry into his chest.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Tristan!" Dylan gasped. She jumped off the bed, almost falling in her haste to cross the room. He stood as she approached and, forgetting herself, she threw her arms around him in relief. Quiet sobs escaped her, making her chest shake. She nestled her head into his shoulder and let herself drown in the ocean of safety and pleasure that engulfed her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“崔斯坦！”迪伦喘息着说。她跳下床，慌乱中穿过屋子时几乎摔倒。崔斯坦就站在那里，她忘情地扑过来，如释重负地搂着他。不知不觉间她开始低声呜咽，胸口跟着一颤一颤的。她的头依偎在他的肩上，尽情沉浸在无尽的安心与喜悦中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Eventually Dylan felt the rush of emotions subside into calm, and she drew herself away from him, as the awkwardness returned. She had little experience of being held by boys, and her head was a whirlwind of confused emotions. A blush warmed her cheeks slightly, but she forced herself to look up into his eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，迪伦起伏澎湃的心绪终于归于平静。此时的她才感到一丝尴尬，忙把身子闪到一边。之前她很少被男孩子抱过，现在她的心里五味杂陈，乱极了。迪伦的脸上泛起淡淡的红晕，但她还是强迫自己抬头直视他的眼睛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I thought… I thought you were gone." Dylan's voice caught with emotion, but she ploughed on, desperate to know. "What happened, you were just behind me?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Tristan's face was barely recognisable. One eye was puffy and almost closed; the other bloodshot. His jaw was bruised and swollen, and one cheek had a deep gash running the length of it. He struggled to smile, but the attempt clearly hurt. Even in the dark, his eyes conveyed the suffering he had endured. Dylan reached a hand up to stroke his face, but hesitated, afraid to cause him any more pain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="崔斯坦的脸几乎面目全非了。一只眼睛肿着，眯成了一道缝；另一只眼睛布满了血丝。瘀紫的下巴肿得老高，一道又深又长的刀伤划过了半边脸颊。他努力做出微笑的样子，但看得出来即使动一下也会很疼。甚至在黑暗中，她也能从他的眼神中感受到他的伤痛。迪伦伸手想摸摸他的脸，但又害怕这会让他更疼，手悬在半空又停住了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a pause. Dylan's eyes searched in the darkness, but she couldn't see enough to read his expression.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="沉默。迪伦的眼在黑暗中搜索，但始终看不清他脸上的表情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He took her hand and led her back over to the bed, sitting beside her. The light from the fire now flickered across his face, illuminating it for the first time and causing Dylan a sharp intake of breath.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他握着她的手，把她拉回床边，自己也挨着她坐下。火光在他的脸上摇曳，此时迪伦才第一次看清他的脸，不禁倒抽一口冷气。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dylan stared at him with pleading eyes. She knew he was trying to avoid discussion of where he'd been, but it felt as though he didn't want to talk to her about anything. She felt rejected. She'd thrown herself at him and made her joy at his return very obvious. Now she just felt foolish. Her eyes smarting, she folded her arms across her chest. He seemed to sense her emotions. He reached and caught one of her hands, pulling it gently away from her side.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦一双恳切的眼睛盯着他。她知道他在尽力回避，不愿意说出他去了哪里。可感觉他像是跟自己完全无话可说似的，她感觉自己受了冷落。刚才她扑向他，毫无保留地表达了重逢的喜悦，现在她觉得自己很蠢。她感到眼睛一阵刺痛，双臂交叉抵在了胸前。他似乎也觉察到了她的情绪，伸手轻柔地把她的一只手放了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Do you think you could sleep more?" She shook her head before his sentence was finished. "Well, at the very least you should lie down and rest, tomorrow we have far to go."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“觉得自己还能再睡会儿吗？”他的话音未落，她就已经摇头了，“好吧，至少你应该躺下来休息一会儿，明天我们还有很远的路要走呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She nodded. "It was just to pass the time."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她点点头，“只是在熬时间而已。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He shuffled backwards till he was leaning against the wall and pulled her over beside his chest. She nestled into his side, feeling self-conscious but safe. He didn't seem to want to speak, but was content to lie there beside her. Dylan smiled to herself and allowed herself to relax for the first time in two days.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他慢慢向后退，靠在墙壁上，然后把她拉到自己胸口旁。她依偎在他怀里，既感到羞涩又觉得心安。他似乎不想说话，但身旁有她相伴已经心满意足了。迪伦暗自微笑，两天来第一次让自己放松下来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"We should get going," Tristan whispered in her ear. His voice was soft and low, his breath tickled her neck and sent a shiver down her spine. Embarrassed, she jumped off the bed and away from him, coming to a standstill in the middle of the room, opposite a window. She glanced out of it and saw that the wasteland, her wasteland was back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们该走了。”崔斯坦在她耳边小声说。他的声音温柔而低沉，他的呼吸让她的脖子痒痒的，她忍不住打了一个冷战。她尴尬地跳下床，从他身边溜走，对着窗子站在屋子中间，一动也不动。她向窗外望去，又看见了那片荒原。她的荒原又回来了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the mornin light Tristan's injuries looked even more horrific. His left eye was a blur of blue and black shadows, and his jaw was covered in shades of purple, brown and yellow. The gash down his cheek was beginning to close, but the dried blood stood out starkly against his white skin. He also had several long scratches down his arms. As the morning chased the gloom from the cottage, Dylan traced her fingers down one particularly vicious-looking wound that ran the length of Tristan's forearm. She still lay in his arms, and though she felt incredibly comfortable and secure there, she was afraid to speak and break the silence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在晨光中，崔斯坦的伤口看起来更加触目惊心。他的左眼血肉模糊，青一块紫一块；下巴上全是紫色、棕色和黄色的伤痕；脸颊上的砍伤已经开始愈合了，但是干了的血污在白皙皮肤的衬托下显得格外扎眼；他的胳膊上也有几道很长的抓痕。当黎明驱走了小屋里的黑暗后，迪伦用手指轻轻抚摸着他前臂上一处看起来特别可怕的伤口。她仍然躺在他的臂弯里，尽管她觉得无比惬意安心，却生怕一开口就会打破这份宁静。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What do you mean?" Tristan looked up sharply.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这话是什么意思？”崔斯坦迅速抬头向上看了一眼。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yesterday, before you came, I looked out of the door and… and…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“昨天，就在你回来之前，我向门外看，然后……然后……”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan didn't know quite how to describe the world she had seen. "Everything was red -- the sun, the sky, the ground. And I could see souls, thousands of them, travelling with their guides. I saw the demons, they were everywhere." Caught in this memory, Dylan's voice tailed off into a whisper.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦不知道该怎样形容她之前看到的那个世界，“所有东西都是红的—太阳、天空还有大地。我看得见鬼魂，成千上万的鬼魂，有向导引着他们走。我看见了魔鬼，到处都是。”迪伦完全沉浸在了回忆中，声音越来越小，几乎变成了耳语。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"So it's fake? Everything I see is fake? It's just in my head?" Tristan had told her that, told her the wasteland was her projection, but Dylan had never really appreciated just what that meant. Until now. She didn't like it. Although the wasteland of yesterday had been horrifying, she couldn't stand the thought of being tricked by Tristan.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那这是假的了？我看到的一切都是假的？只是我头脑中的幻觉？”崔斯坦之前告诉过她，这个荒原只是她的心像，但直到现在迪伦才真正理解其中含义。她不喜欢这样。虽然昨天的荒原非常恐怖，但她一想到自己被崔斯坦欺骗了，心里还是接受不了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tristan frowned at her. He could not remember a time when a soul had seen and guessed so much about this world. No soul had ever been separated from their ferryman and survived a demon attack before. Dylan should be lost to him, and yet here she was. He was astounded, and palpably grateful, that she stood before him. How could this seemingly ordinary soul be so extraordinary?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="崔斯坦皱起了眉头。他从未见过哪个鬼魂见识了荒原上的那么多事后，还能对这里浮想联翩。如果离开了他们的摆渡人，鬼魂在魔鬼的袭击下绝不会安然无恙。迪伦本应和他永别了，可现在她还在这里。她能好端端地站在自己面前，这既让他感到惊诧，同时又为此深感庆幸。这个看起来普普通通的魂魄怎么竟会如此与众不同呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You only see the true wasteland when you lose your guide," he said to her. "I am the vessel that creates your projection."</div>

<div class="line_en">Dylan looked at him, and her eyes were pools of helplessness. He held out his hand to her, aware that she was fragile, but knowing it was dangerous to delay.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦看着他，眼中满是绝望与无助。他伸手牵她，感觉到她是那么娇小虚弱，但他明白再拖下去会非常危险。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Dylan," he said tenderly. There was no way to sugarcoat his words so he tried to lessen their bite with his tone of voice. "You're dead. What you see in your mind is all you have. This place, here, this is the only way you can make the journey. This is what's real."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“迪伦。”他声音轻柔。他没有办法给自己的话裹上糖衣，只能用语调尽量缓和这话的杀伤力，“你已经死了，你的心像就是你的全部。这个地方，这里，就是你这段旅程的必经之路。真相就是这样。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Come on," he said. "Let's go." He gave her a warm, reassuring smile that she returned with slightly trembling lips. She stepped forward to take his hand, thrilling a little at the contact, and faced the door. This cottage had been both jail and shelter to her, and she had mixed feelings about leaving it. Keen to be off, Tristan strode confidently to the door and pulled her after him, out once more into the wasteland.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“来吧，”他说，“我们走吧。”他给了她一个温暖、宽慰的微笑。她的嘴唇微微一颤，算作回应。她走上前拉着他的手，刚一碰到他心中就怦然一动。她面朝着小屋的门，这座小屋对她来说既是囚牢又是庇护所，离开这里她心里也说不清是悲是喜。崔斯坦急着要走，把她落在身后，大步流星地朝门走去，又一次踏上了荒原。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was no sun today, but the layer of cloud that covered the sky was light and fluffy. Dylan wondered what it revealed about her mood. If she had to identify it herself, she would say pensive and curious. She was confused by what Tristan had said about the wasteland and her mind, but although she did not want to be deceived by this artificial place, she felt a lot safer in the now familiar landscape of hills. Of course, the presence of Tristan played a vital role in that. She looked at him again, at the back of his head and his strong shoulders as he led her forward. What had happened to him? When she had spoken to him last night, he hadn't wanted to talk about it, but Dylan felt responsible for every bruise, every scratch. After all, he was here protecting her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="今天看不到太阳，遮蔽天空的云层显得轻飘飘、毛绒绒的。迪伦想知道这又反映了自己怎样的心情。要是让她自己来说个清楚，她会说自己现在既忧伤又好奇。崔斯坦那些关于荒原和她内心世界的话让她一头雾水，她虽然不想被这个虚幻的地方欺骗，但现在走在熟悉的山峦景物中还是让她倍感安全。当然，崔斯坦的陪伴也起了很关键的作用。她又看了看领着她前行的崔斯坦，看着他的后脑勺和强壮的肩膀。他到底遭遇了什么？昨晚他们说话时，他一直不愿提起这件事。但迪伦感觉他身上每一片青肿、每一处抓痕都是为了她而伤的，毕竟他是她的保护人啊。">查看中文翻译</div>

A glow began in his chest, and he knew his decision was made.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="崔斯坦看起来很吃惊，他是真的吃惊。这不是他预料之中的答案，他原以为她问这些只是出于对这个世界的好奇，他原以为人类需要什么都问个明白，但她问这些竟是出于关心。一股暖流涌上胸口，他知道自己该做何选择了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You didn't tell me they could hurt you," she said softly, her green eyes wide with empathetic pain.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我推了你一把，你好像才缓过神来。接着，我们跑的时候，我觉得我们会没事的。”他脸上露出痛苦的表情。由于羞愧，眉头拧在了一起，“我当时不是故意要放开你的。”他小声说。">查看中文翻译</div>

The set of his mouth told Dylan that it was a painful process. Her guilt increased tenfold as she realised that she was hurting him again by dredging this back up, and she began to question her motives. Was it simply nosiness? She hoped not.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对不起，迪伦。我很抱歉。他们一看到我放开了你，就把我围了起来，正好堵在我们俩之间。我想追上你，但从他们中间穿不过去。你在飞跑，但是小屋离得太远了，来不及的。”此时他的眼神飘忽，像是在重温当时的情景。他的口型告诉迪伦这是一段不堪回首的痛苦经历。一想到自己重提往事是对他的又一次伤害，迪伦的内疚感顿时强烈了十倍。她开始反思自己这样做的动机。仅仅是满足自己的好奇心吗？但愿不是。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He broke off at this point and seemed to be struggling internally. Dylan wasn't sure if he was debating about whether to say something or simply trying to work out how to say it. She waited patiently. Tristan looked up at the sky -- quite a feat as they were traversing a fairly steep hill and it was taking all of Dylan's powers of concentration to keep her feet steady and listen at the same time. However the sky seemed to hold his answer as he nodded curtly and sighed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他突然停了下来，像是内心正在挣扎。迪伦不清楚他是在纠结于有些事要不要讲还是在努力思索讲述的方式。她静静地等着。崔斯坦仰望着天空—他们此时正翻越一座陡峭的山峰，此时抬头看天真是需要极大的勇气。迪伦集中了所有的注意力，想一边站稳脚跟，一边听他讲话。天空中似乎有他要找的答案，他略略点了一下头，叹了口气。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dylan pictured it in her head as he spoke. The demons plummeting downwards, curling viciously around him, pulling and scratching at his face. She imagined him trying to fight them off, thrashing his arms at them and trying to run. The demons swarming all over him, grabbing tighter and pulling him down, down into the ground. Although, even in her imagination, he should have been too far away for her to see, every feature of his expression was crystal clear: his face a mask of terror and panic, eyes wide and mouth gaping open in horror. Blood trickled down his face, running into his left eye, where one of the demons had mauled him. In her mind's eye, Tristan slowly disappeared. How much had they hurt him? How much pain had there been in each blow, each clawing talon? All of it for her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在他讲述的同时，迪伦在脑海中想象着当时的情景：恶鬼们向下俯冲，将他团团围住，撕扯着抓挠着他的脸。她脑中浮现了他努力想把它们击退，朝它们抡起双臂，试图冲出重围的样子。密密麻麻的恶鬼们围着他，越抓越紧，把他拖到了地下。尽管在她的想象中，她应该根本无法看到很远处的他，然而他脸上每一个细微特征却又无比清晰—他的脸上满是惊惧和恐怖，双眼圆睁，嘴因为恐惧而大张着。血顺着脸淌，流进了已经被恶鬼抓伤的左眼里。然后，他在她的想象中慢慢消失了。他受了多少伤啊？它们每打一下，它们的利爪每抓一下，他都要忍受多大的疼痛啊？他所遭受的这一切都是为了她。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"They tried attacking me, slashing at me with their claws and flying straight at me, kind of like a full body punch. They can't go through me like they can you.

<div class="line_cn" title="“我最后听你在叫我。我想把它们赶走然后到你身边，但它们太多了。不过听到你的声音至少让我知道你安全了。”他注视着她，那双湛蓝色的眼睛深深打动了她。她能做的只有满怀敬畏地回望着他，沉浸在他深邃的目光中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh!" she gasped, as she felt herself falling forward towards the ground. She closed her eyes and waited for the thump that would force the breath from her lungs and coat her clothes in moisture and muck. Her hands came out in front of her to protect her body from the worst of the impact, but it never came. Tristan's hand darted out and grabbed the back of her jumper, bringing her to an abrupt stop just above the ground. She opened her eyes and peeked at the path. As she'd thought -- wet and mucky. She hadn't even sighed with relief before she was yanked backwards as Tristan pulled her upright. He tried very hard to keep a straight face, but a laugh escaped his clenched jaw.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢！”感觉自己朝前栽倒时，她不由得大叫了一声。她眼一闭，等着这重重的一摔，顿时让自己肺部无法呼吸，等着衣服上沾满泥水。她把手护在身前，免得受太重的伤。然而最坏的结果并没有发生，崔斯坦的手一甩，从后面抓住了她的套衫，就在她的身体快要摔在地面的一刹那，一切都戛然而止了。她睁开眼，偷偷瞄了一眼这条道—真的跟她想的一样，又潮湿又泥泞。她还没来得及如释重负地喘口大气，崔斯坦猛地把她往回一拉，她又好好地站在那儿了。他竭力绷着脸，但尽管下巴绷得很紧，笑声还是渗了出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So of course she fell. Her foot, without being guided by her eyes, caught on a clump of grass sticking out from the ground.</div>

He meant it to cheer her up, but Dylan's face fell a little at this news. Then what? What was beyond this wasteland? And did that mean she would never see Tristan again after this? This news was more upsetting than her fear of the unknown. He had become the only person in her world, and she couldn't bear to lose this final thing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，懂了。”他说完咧着嘴笑，“好吧，要是你知道我们已经走完了一半的路，心里会轻松点的。很快你就要走出这儿了。”他原意是想逗她开心，但听到这个消息后，迪伦却脸色微沉。然后呢？过了荒原又是什么地方？就是说她以后再也见不到崔斯坦了吗？这个消息比起对未知世界的恐惧更让她心情沮丧。他已经成了她的世界里的唯一，她实在无法忍受失去这最后的亲人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Her musings took her to the top of the hill, over a few lumps and bumps and into a natural hollow. The perfect spot for a little rest. She looked hopefully at Tristan and he smiled, understanding. With the smile came a shake of his head, however.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦想着心事，就这样走到了山顶，经过几次颠簸后，进入了一个天然山洞。这里是小憩的理想场所。她一脸期待地看着崔斯坦，他会心一笑，却摇了摇头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He held out a hand, an invitation. Dylan gazed at it morosely, but he was right. They had to try and stay ahead of the night, and the wraiths that came with it. She didn't want Tristan to suffer any more because of her. Reaching out, she took the hand he offered. It was covered with scratches and bruises, mirroring the faded marks on Dylan's own arms, but his grip was strong. He pulled her up out of the hollow and at once she was assaulted by the strength of the wind. It had definitely picked up, and the stinging in her ears deafened her slightly. It made conversation difficult as they descended. Dylan had hoped to get Tristan back to his story, of what had gone on beneath the earth, but it seemed she would have to wait for a more peaceful moment. It wasn't the sort of tale that could be shouted over the wind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他伸出手，做了一个邀请的姿势。迪伦看起来有些愁眉苦脸，但她知道崔斯坦说得没错。他们必须抓紧时间，赶到夜幕和随之而来的恶魔前面。她不希望崔斯坦再因为她受苦了，于是握住了他的手。这只手上满是抓痕和青肿，在迪伦胳膊上已经消失的伤痕对比下格外醒目，但他的手非常有力。他刚带她走出山洞，迪伦马上感到狂风袭来。风势越来越大，耳朵里的刺痛让她有点听不清楚声音。他们往山下走的时候，交谈变得非常困难。迪伦本来还想让崔斯坦接着讲故事，讲讲地下发生了什么事，现在看来要等更安静的时候才行了。这样的故事不能隔着风声喊来喊去的。">查看中文翻译</div>
