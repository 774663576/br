<div class="line_en">When I heard the sound of the car in the drive I got up in sudden panic, glancing at the clock, for I knew that it meant Beatrice and her husband had arrived. It was only just gone twelve; they were much earlier than I expected. And Maxim was not yet back. I wondered if it would be possible to hide, to get out of the window, into the garden so that Frith, bringing them to the morning-room, would say, "Madam must have gone out," and it would seem quite natural, they would take it as a matter of course.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="车道上有汽车的声音响起，我猛地惊跳起来，一定是比阿特丽斯夫妇到了。我看看时钟，刚才十二点，没想到他们这么早就来。迈克西姆还没回家。我不知道能不能跳出窗子，躲到花园里去。这样，如果弗里思把他们领到晨室，看见我不在，就会说：“太太大概出去了。”这是很自然的事，客人们也不会觉得有什么反常。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The window opened out on to the terrace and the little grass clearing beyond, but as I prepared to brush past the rhododendrons the sound of voices came close, and I backed again into the room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="窗子外面是平台，再过去一点是小草地。正当我准备擦过石南花跳出窗子时，我听见人声渐近，于是又赶快退回房间。肯定，弗里思告诉他们这会儿我正在展室，他们便从花园这条路进屋来了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They were coming to the house by way of the garden, Frith having told them doubtless that I was in the morning-room. I went quickly into the big drawing-room, and made for a door near me on the left. It led into a long stone passage, and I ran along it, fully aware of my stupidity, despising myself for this sudden attack of nerves, but I knew I could not face these people, not for a moment anyway.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我快步走进大客厅，直奔左首近处的一扇门而去。门外是一条长长的石筑甬道。我沿着甬道狂奔，完全意识到自己又在犯愚蠢的错误。这种突发性的神经质使我鄙视自己，但是我知道这会儿无论如何没法见客人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They would lead me, I supposed, to the bedrooms, and I could find my suite in the east wing, and sit up there a little while, until I judged it nearly time for lunch, when good manners would compel me to come down again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我想走上楼梯一定便是卧室，我能在东厢找到自己的那套房间，然后往里边一躲，直到午饭时分世俗礼仪逼得我非下楼不可时再说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The passage seemed to be taking me to the back regions, and as I turned a corner, coming upon another staircase, I met a servant I had not seen before, a scullery-maid perhaps; she carried a mop and pail in her hands. She stared at me in wonder, as though I were a vision, unexpected in this part of the house, and "Good morning," I said, in great confusion, making for the stairway, and "Good morning, Madam," she returned, her mouth open, her round eyes inquisitive as I climbed the stairs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="甬道大概通往宅子的后部。转过一个弯，我来到另一段楼梯跟前。在这儿我碰上一个从没见过的女佣，她提着拖把和木桶，大概是打杂的女工。她惊异地望着我，仿佛见了鬼，显然是没料到会在这儿遇到我。我心慌意乱地说一声“早安”，就向楼梯奔去。她回了一句：“早安，太太”，一面大张着嘴，眼睛瞪得滚圆，好奇地望着我登上楼梯。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I must have lost my bearings, for passing through a door at the head of the stairs I came to a long corridor that I had not seen before, similar in some ways to the one in the east wing, but broader and darker -- dark owing to the panelling of the walls.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我大概把方向弄错了。因为穿过楼梯口的一扇门，我发现自己来到一条长长的走廊上。这条走廊我没见到过，多少同东厢的走廊相似，只是更宽大，另外，因为墙上嵌镶着护壁板，比东厢的也更黝暗。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I hesitated, then turned left, coming upon a broad landing and another staircase. It was very quiet and dark. No one was about. If there had been housemaids here, during the morning, they had finished their work by now and gone downstairs. There was no trace of their presence, no lingering dust smell of carpets lately swept, and I thought, as I stood there, wondering which way to turn, that the silence was unusual, holding something of the same oppression as an empty house does, when the owners have gone away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我迟疑一下，接着往左拐弯，来到另一个宽敞的楼梯口平台。这儿一片死寂，光线暗淡，周围一个人也没有。要是早上曾有使女在这儿打扫，那么这会儿已经完工下楼，没有留下任何痕迹，没有那种清扫地毯之后散发出来的灰尘味儿。我独自站在那儿，不知该往哪个方向走。四下静得出奇，简直就像人去楼空的大宅，置身其中使人觉得相当压抑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I opened a door at hazard, and found a room in total darkness, no chink of light coming through the closed shutters, while I could see dimly, in the centre of the room, the outline of furniture swathed in white dust-sheets.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我随手打开一扇门，来到一间黑屋子。百叶窗全关着，一点光线也透不进来，但我影影绰绰地看到房间中央裹在白罩单里的家具轮廊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The room smelt close and stale, the smell of a room seldom if ever used, whose ornaments are herded together in the centre of a bed and left there, covered with a sheet. It might be too that the curtain had not been drawn from the window since some preceding summer, and if one crossed there now and pulled them aside, opening the creaking shutters, a dead moth who had been imprisoned behind them for many months would fall to the carpet and lie there, beside a forgotten pin, and a dried leaf blown there before the windows were closed for the last time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="房间里很闷，有股霉味儿，就像那种实在难得使用的房间，不住人时，把各种摆设往床铺当中一堆，罩上一条被单。也许从去年夏天以来，窗帷一直不曾拉开过，现在你要是走去拉开它，打开那吱咯作声的百叶窗，也许会有一只在里边关了好几个月的死飞蛾掉在地毯上，与一枚早已被人遗忘的扣针并排着作了伴，还有一片枯叶，那是上一次关窗之前被风吹进房间的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I shut the door softly, and went uncertainly along the corridor, flanked on either side by doors, all of them closed, until I came to a little alcove, set in an outside wall, where a broad window gave me light at last. I looked out, and I saw below me the smooth grass lawns stretching to the sea, and the sea itself, bright green with white-tipped crests, whipped by a westerly wind and scudding from the shore.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我轻轻关上门，无所适从地沿走廊向前。两边都是关着的房间。最后我来到一个从外边墙头凹陷进来的小壁角前。这儿有一扇大窗，总算给我带来了亮光。从这儿望出去，下面是平整的草地，草地往外延伸，便是大海。海上吹着一阵西风，在明亮的绿色水面上激起粼粼白浪，飞快地从岸边荡漾开去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Somehow I was glad my rooms were in the east wing. I preferred the rose-garden, after all, to the sound of the sea.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不知道什么缘故，我因为自己住在东厢而庆幸，我还是宁愿观赏玫瑰园，我可不爱听大海的咆哮！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was closer than I had thought, much closer; it ran, surely, beneath that little knot of trees below the lawns, barely five minutes away, and if I listened now, my ear to the window, I could hear the surf breaking on the shores of some little bay I could not see. I knew then I had made the circuit of the house, and was standing in the corridor of the west wing. Yes, Mrs Danvers was right. You could hear the sea from here. You might imagine, in the winter, it would creep up on to those green lawns and threaten the house itself, for even now, because of the high wind, there was a mist upon the window-glass, as though someone had breathed upon it. A mist salt-laden, borne upwards from the sea. A hurrying cloud hid the sun for a moment as I watched, and the sea changed colour instantly, becoming black, and the white crests with them very pitiless suddenly, and cruel, not the gay sparkling sea I had looked on first.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大海近在咫尺，比我原先想象的要近得多。大海就在草地下边一个小树丛脚下奔腾，打这儿去只要五分钟便可以走到。如果我把耳朵贴近窗户，我还能听到浪花拍击近处什么地方一个小海湾的声响。这时我才知道自己兜了一个大圈，此刻正站在西厢的走廊里。丹弗斯太太说得不错，是的，在这儿确能听到大海的涛声。人们甚至可以想象，在冬天，大海会爬上陆地，淹没草坪，危及房屋本身。即使在此刻，因为风大，窗玻璃上也已经蒙上一层水汽，像是有人在上头呵了一口气，这是从海上吹来的带盐味的轻雾。一片乌云在天空这没了太阳。大海顿时变得黝暗，阵阵白浪也狂暴地奔腾起来，不再像我刚才看见的那种欢快闪光的样子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“您有没有走进哪个房间看看？”她问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I went back to the landing then, at the head of the stairs, and as I prepared to go down, one hand upon the banister, I heard the door behind me open, and it was Mrs Danvers. We stared at one another for a moment without speaking, and I could not be certain whether it was anger I read in her eyes or curiosity, for her face became a mask directly she saw me. Although she said nothing I felt guilty and ashamed, as though I had been caught trespassing, and I felt the tell-tale colour come up into my face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我走回到楼梯口的那一方平台，一手扶着栏杆准备下楼。这时我听见背后的房门打开，丹弗斯太太出现了。我们两人谁也不说话，瞪着眼睛对视了一会。她一见到我，立刻戴上一副假面具，使我无法判断她的眼睛射出的是怒火还是好奇的目光。虽然她什么也没说，我却又心虚起来，羞愧得犹如擅自闯入别人屋子而被逮了个正着。我的脸涨得通红，无异是告诉她我心中鬼。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No," I said. "No, I just opened a door, I did not go in. Everything was dark, covered up in dust-sheets. I'm sorry. I did not mean to disturb anything. I expect you like to keep all this shut up."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，”我赶快回答。“没有。我只是打开过一扇房门看了看，没有进屋，那里暗极了，东西都蒙着罩单。我很抱歉，我并没有想弄乱东西的意思。你大概希望把这儿的一切都锁在屋子里收藏好。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I shook my head. "No, I'd rather not," I said. "No, I must go downstairs." I began to walk down the stairs, and she came with me, by my side, as though she were a warder, and I in custody.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我忙摇头说：“不，我可没有这个想法，喔，我得下楼去了。”我沿着楼梯走下，她跟在我身边，就像押解犯人的卫兵。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Perhaps you would like me to show you all over the west wing?" she said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“也许您希望我带您看看西厢所有的房间吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Any time, when you have nothing to do, you have only to ask me, and I will show you the rooms in the west wing," she persisted, making me vaguely uncomfortable. I knew not why. Her insistence struck a chord in my memory, reminding me of a visit to a friend's house, as a child, when the daughter of the house, older than me, took my arm and whispered in my ear, "I know where there is a book, locked in a cupboard, in my mother's bedroom. Shall we go and look at it?" I remembered her white, excited face, and her small, beady eyes, and the way she kept pinching my arm.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“随便什么时候，只要您有空，跟我说一声，我就带您看看西厢的这些房间。”她一而再、再而三地要带我看房间，这使我隐约觉得不安。其中原因，我也不明白。她紧钉着不放的口吻使我回想到童年时代有一次到朋友家玩，那家有一个年龄比我大的女儿，她拉着我的手臂，在我耳畔低语：“我知道在妈妈卧室的橱里藏着一本书，怎么样？去看看吗？”我记得她在说话时脸激动得煞白，闪亮的眼睛睁得滚圆，一面还不住捏我的膀子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I will have the dust-sheets removed, and then you can see the rooms as they looked when they were used," said Mrs Danvers. "I would have shown you this morning, but I believed you to be writing letters in the morning-room. You have only to telephone through to my room, you know, when you want me. It would only take a short while to have the rooms in readiness."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我可以把罩单取走，这样您就能见到这些房间的本来面貌，”丹弗斯太太说。“本来今天早晨我就可以带您参观，但是我以为您在晨室里写信。您什么时候有事吩咐，请打个电话到我房间来。把这些房间打扫一下，布置停当，不花多少时间。”">查看中文翻译</div>

I had not realized that, or of course we would never have thrust ourselves upon you so soon. Well, what do you think of Manderley?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这是弗兰克—克劳利，”迈克西姆把总管事介绍给我。此人脸无血色，瘦骨嶙峋，喉结突出。当他看着我的时候，我在他的眼光里发现了一种如释重负的表情。这是为什么？可还没等我细想，弗里思进来了，给我端上雪利酒。比阿特丽斯也来找我说话：“迈克西姆说你们昨天晚上刚到。我可不知道，要不然，我们自然不会今天就跑来打扰你们。嗯，你觉得曼陀丽边地方怎么样？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Beatrice was tall, broad-shouldered, very handsome, very much like Maxim about the eyes and jaw, but not as smart as I had expected, much tweedier; the sort of person who would nurse dogs through distemper, know about horses, shoot well. She did not kiss me. She shook hands very firmly, looking me straight in the eyes, and then turned to Maxim. "Quite different from what I expected. Doesn't answer to your description at all."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="比阿特丽斯个子很高，肩膀宽宽的，长得很好看，眼睛和颌部同迈克西姆很相像。不过她不像我原先想象的那么漂亮，比阿特丽斯粗犷得像个男子，完全是那种养狗成癖、擅长骑射的人物。她没有吻我，只是紧紧捏着我的手一握，一面还笔直地看着我的眼睛。她转过脸去对迈克西姆说：“跟我想象的大不相同。完全不像你描述的那样子。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Here she is at last," said Maxim. "Where have you been hiding? We were thinking of sending out a search party. Here is Beatrice, and this is Giles, and this is Frank Crawley. Look out, you nearly trod on the dog."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，她总算来了，”迈克西姆说，“你躲到哪儿去了？我们正准备派人分头去找你。这是比阿特丽斯，这是贾尔斯，这是弗兰克—克劳利。嗨，当心，你差一点踩在狗身上。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Everyone laughed, and I joined in, not quite certain if the laugh was against me or not, wondering secretly what it was she had expected, and what had been Maxim's description.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Tell me a bit about yourself," she said at last; "what was it you were doing in the south of France? Living with some appalling American woman, Maxim said."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过了一会，她才又开口说话：“给我讲点你的情况吧。当时你在法国南部干什么？迈克西姆说你跟一个讨厌的美国女人呆在一起。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes," she said, when I paused, "it all happened very suddenly, as you say. But of course we were all delighted, my dear, and I do hope you will be happy."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="待我讲完，她才说：“是啊，正像你所说，一切都发生得很突然。不过，亲爱的，我们大家都为此感到高兴，真希望你俩过得幸福。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="她不作声了。我们在草坪上来口溜达。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I explained about Mrs Van Hopper, and what had led to it, and she seemed sympathetic but a little vague, as though she was thinking of something else.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我讲了范—霍珀夫人和以后发生的事。她好像显示出同情的样子，但态度暖昧，有些心不在焉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Thank you, Beatrice," I said, "thank you very much." I wondered why she said she hoped we would be happy, instead of saying she knew we would be so. She was kind, she was sincere, I liked her very much, but there was a tiny doubt in her voice that made me afraid.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“谢谢你，比阿特丽斯，”我说。“非常感谢，”我嘴上这么说，心里却在纳闷，为什么她说“希望”我俩过得幸福，而不说“肯定”。这个人心肠好，很直率，我喜欢他。但是她的话音里微微带一点疑虑，这又使我不安。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"When Maxim wrote and told me," she went on, taking my arm, "and said he had discovered you in the south of France, and you were very young, very pretty, I must admit it gave me a bit of a shock. Of course we all expected a social butterfly, very modern and plastered with paint, the sort of girl you expected to meet in those sort of places. When you came into the morning-room before lunch you could have knocked me down with a feather."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她挽起我的手臂继续说：“当迈克西姆写信来告诉我这个消息的时候，说实话，我很奇怪。他说他在法国南部遇到你，还说你很年轻，长得不错。当然，大家都以为你一定是个交际花之类的时髦人物，脸上涂得红红绿绿。在那种地方碰上这样的人是不稀奇的。午饭前你进晨室的时候，简直弄得我目瞪口呆。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Part of me wanted her to continue her train of thought, to tell me more of the past, naturally and easily like this, and something else, way back in my mind, did not want to know, did not want to hear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我有点儿希望她就这样自然而平易地往下说，多告诉我一点过去的事情；可是，在心底，我又暗暗觉得，我不想知道这一切，我不愿再听说下去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We are not a bit alike, you know," she said, "our characters are poles apart. I show everything on my face: whether I like people or not, whether I am angry or pleased. There's no reserve about me. Maxim is entirely different. Very quiet, very reserved. You never know what's going on in that funny mind of his. I lose my temper on the slightest provocation, flare up, and then it's all over. Maxim loses his temper once or twice in a year, and when he does -- my God -- he does lose it. I don't suppose he ever will with you, I should think you are a placid little thing."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你知道，迈克西姆跟我是完全不一样的人，”她说。“我们的性格截然相反。我这人喜怒哀乐全表现在脸上，对别人的好恶一点儿也藏不住，迈克西姆则完全不同，他很沉默，感情从不外露。你根本猜不透他那古怪的脑袋里装着些什么样的想法。谁稍微惹我一下，我就按捺不住，大发雷霆，但过后马上就忘个精光。迈克西姆一年里难得发一两次脾气，可是一发作起来，那真是不得了。我看对你他大概不会这样，你是个沉静的小乖乖。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She smiled, and pinched my arm, and I thought about being placid, how quiet and comfortable it sounded, someone with knitting on her lap, with calm unruffled brow. Someone who was never anxious, never tortured by doubt and indecision, someone who never stood as I did, hopeful, eager, frightened, tearing at bitten nails, uncertain which way to go, what star to follow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她微笑着捏捏我的膀子。我想“沉静”这两个字听上去多么安详而舒适。膝盖上摊着针线活，脸色平和，不慌不忙，不急不躁，无忧无虑。我可根本不是这种人；时而贪求，时而恐惧，撕拉着咬得不成样子的指甲，不知何去何从！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You won't mind me saying so, will you?" she went on, "but I think you ought to do something to your hair. Why don't you have it waved? It's so very lanky, isn't it, like that? Must look awful under a hat. Why don't you sweep it back behind your ears?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她接着说：“有句话要对你说，请你不要见怪好吗？我觉得你的头发得好好弄一弄。为什么不去烫一下？你不觉得你的长发太平直吗？散在帽子底下一定够难看的。为什么不拢到耳朵背后去？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I did so obediently, and waited for her approval. She looked at me critically, her head on one side. "No," she said. "No, I think that's worse. It's too severe, and doesn't suit you. No, all you need is a wave, just to pinch it up. I never have cared for that Joan of Arc business or whatever they call it. What does Maxim say? Does he think it suits you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我顺从地用手掠掠头发。等着她表示赞许，她侧着头挑剔地看了一会说：“不行，不行，这样更糟。这种发式过于老成。对你不合适。看来你是得去烫一烫，把头发扎起来就行了。我可从来不喜欢那种圣女贞德①式或是换个别的什么名字的时髦发式。迈克西姆怎么说？也许他觉得这样好？”——【注：①一译为冉—达克。历史上百年战争末期抗击英军的法国女英雄，后被处火刑。】">查看中文翻译</div>

I suppose Frank will go back to the office. What a dull creature he is, never has anything interesting to say. Well, all of you. What have you been discussing? Pulling the world to bits, I suppose."

<div class="line_en">The wind had dropped. The afternoon was drowsy, peaceful. The grass had been new-mown; it smelt sweet and rich, like summer. A bee droned above Giles's head, and he flicked at it with his hat. Jasper sloped in to join us, too warm in the sun, his tongue lolling from his mouth. He flopped beside me, and began licking his side, his large eyes apologetic. The sun shone on the mullioned windows of the house, and I could see the green lawns and the terrace reflected in them. Smoke curled thinly from one of the near chimneys, and I wondered if the library fire had been lit, according to routine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="风停了，午后的宁静使人昏昏欲睡。草地刚经修剪，发出浓郁的新草香味，仿佛夏天已经来临。一只蜜蜂在贾尔斯头上嗡嗡打转，他挥着帽子驱赶它。杰斯珀跑下草坡，来到我们脚边，因为太热，伸着舌头。它扑通一声在我身边躺下，舔着自己的肚子，那对大眼睛露出抱愧的神情。太阳照耀着带竖框的窗子，把绿色的草坪和庭院都映进我的眼里。近处的烟囱，有淡淡的青烟袅袅飘起，我想他们大概已按惯例把藏书室的炉火点着了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In a little while it would be different, there would come tomorrow, and the next day, and another year. And we would be changed perhaps, never sitting quite like this again. Some of us would go away, or suffer, or die; the future stretched away in front of us, unknown, unseen, not perhaps what we wanted, not what we planned. This moment was safe though, this could not be touched. Here we sat together, Maxim and I, hand-in-hand, and the past and the future mattered not at all. This was secure, this funny fragment of time he would never remember, never think about again. He would not hold it sacred; he was talking about cutting away some of the undergrowth in the drive, and Beatrice agreed, interrupting with some suggestion of her own, and throwing a piece of grass at Giles at the same time. For them it was just after lunch, quarter past three on a haphazard afternoon, like any hour, like any day. They did not want to hold it close, imprisoned and secure, as I did. They were not afraid.</div>

<div class="line_en">A thrush flew across the lawn to the magnolia tree outside the dining-room window. I could smell the faint, soft magnolia scent as I sat here, on the lawn. Everything was quiet and still. Very distant now came the washing of the sea in the bay below. The tide must have gone out.</div>

She had been born here, bred here; she knew it all, she belonged here more than I should ever do. She must have many memories locked inside her heart. I wondered if she ever thought about the days that were gone, ever remembered the lanky pig-tailed child that she had been once, so different from the woman she had become, forty-five now, vigorous and settled in her ways, another person…</div>

<div class="line_en">We came to the rooms, and Giles, stooping under the low doorway, said, "How very jolly; this is a great improvement, isn't it, Bee?" and "I say, old boy, you have spread yourself," said Beatrice: "new curtains, new beds, new everything. You remember, Giles, we had this room that time you were laid up with your leg? It was very dingy then. Of course Mother never had much idea of comfort. And then, you never put people here, did you, Maxim? Except when there was an overflow. The bachelors were always dumped here. Well, it's charming, I must say. Looks over the rose-garden too, which was always an advantage. May I powder my nose?"</div>
