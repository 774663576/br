<div class="line_en">Elsa is having terrible nightmares tonight. She's always dreaded closing her eyes and no longer being able to get to the Land-of-Almost-Awake. The worst thing would be a dreamless sleep. But this is the night she learns of something even worse. Because she can't get to the Land-of-Almost-Awake, and yet she dreams about it. She can see it clearly from above, as if she's lying on her stomach on top of a huge glass dome, peering down at it. Without being able to smell any smells or hear any laughter or feel the rush of wind over her face when the cloud animals take off. It's the most terrifying dream of all the eternities.</div>

Cloud animals, mercilessly butchered, lie in the ashes. All of Granny's tales are burning.</div>

<div class="line_en">Elsa wakes up when she throws herself out of the bed and lands facedown against the floor. She cowers there, her chest heaving, her hands covering her throat. It feels as if millions of eternities have passed before she can trust that she's back in the real world. She's not had a single nightmare since Granny and the cloud animals first brought her to the Land-of-Almost-Awake. She had forgotten how nightmares feel. She stands up, sweaty and exhausted, checks to see that she's not been bitten by one of the shadows, and tries to get her thoughts into order.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱莎滚下床，脸朝下摔在地板上，醒了。她瑟瑟发抖，大口大口喘着粗气，双手捂着自己的喉咙。在她确认自己已经回到真实世界之前，似乎过了“上百万个永恒”。自从外婆和云兽第一次将她带去不眠大陆，她就再没有做过一次噩梦，甚至已经忘记噩梦是什么样子的。她站起身，浑身是汗，精疲力竭，检查自己是不是被某只暗影咬了，同时试图理清思绪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One figure wanders among the shadows. A slim man enveloped in a cloud of cigarette smoke. That's the only scent Elsa can smell up there on top of the dome, the smell of Granny's tobacco. Suddenly the figure looks up and two clear blue eyes penetrate the haze. A shroud of mist seeps between his thin lips. Then he points directly at Elsa, his forefinger deformed into a gray claw, and he shouts something, and in the next moment hundreds of shadows launch themselves from the ground and engulf her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有个人在暗影间游荡。一个包裹在香烟烟雾中的瘦削男人。那是爱莎在玻璃罩顶唯一能闻到的气味，外婆烟草的气味。突然，那个人抬头，一双明亮的蓝色眼睛透过迷雾望过来，薄唇间吐出一片迷雾。然后他直直指向爱莎，食指扭曲变形成灰爪。他喊了些什么，下一刻，成百的暗影从地面涌上来，吞没了她。">查看中文翻译</div>

Panic wells up inside of her, but Alf glares at her and makes a quick "stay calm" gesture, so that's what she tries to do. She looks at Britt-Marie and tries to figure out if she's worked up today because she has found the wurse, or if it's a quite normal fuss about the usual Britt-Marie stuff. It seems to be the latter, thank God, but directed at Mum.</div>
