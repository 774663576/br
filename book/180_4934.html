<div class="line_en">Yes, Mr Bankes said, watching him go. It was a thousand pities. (Lily had said something about his frightening her -- he changed from one mood to another so suddenly.) Yes, said Mr Bankes, it was a thousand pities that Ramsay could not behave a little more like other people. (For he liked Lily Briscoe; he could discuss Ramsay with her quite openly.) It was for that reason, he said, that the young don't read Carlyle. A crusty old grumbler who lost his temper if the porridge was cold, why should he preach to us? was what Mr Bankes understood that young people said nowadays. It was a thousand pities if you thought, as he did, that Carlyle was one of the great teachers of mankind. Lily was ashamed to say that she had not read Carlyle since she was at school. But in her opinion one liked Mr Ramsay all the better for thinking that if his little finger ached the whole world must come to an end. It was not THAT she minded. For who could be deceived by him? He asked you quite openly to flatter him, to admire him, his little dodges deceived nobody. What she disliked was his narrowness, his blindness, she said, looking after him.</div>

<div class="line_en">"A bit of a hypocrite?" Mr Bankes suggested, looking too at Mr Ramsay's back, for was he not thinking of his friendship, and of Cam refusing to give him a flower, and of all those boys and girls, and his own house, full of comfort, but, since his wife's death, quiet rather? Of course, he had his work… All the same, he rather wished Lily to agree that Ramsay was, as he said, "a bit of a hypocrite."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“有那么点伪君子的味道？”班克斯先生提出道，一面也看着拉姆齐先生的背影，因为他不正是在想着他的友谊，想着卡姆不肯给他一朵花，想着所有那些男孩和女孩，想着他自己那所原来非常舒适、但妻子去世后却很冷清的住宅吗？当然，他有他的工作……然而他还是希望莉莉能同意，如他所说的那样，拉姆齐“有那么点伪君子的味道”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Lily Briscoe went on putting away her brushes, looking up, looking down. Looking up, there he was -- Mr Ramsay -- advancing towards them, swinging, careless, oblivious, remote. A bit of a hypocrite? she repeated. Oh, no -- the most sincere of men, the truest (here he was), the best; but, looking down, she thought, he is absorbed in himself, he is tyrannical, he is unjust; and kept looking down, purposely, for only so could she keep steady, staying with the Ramsays. Directly one looked up and saw them, what she called "being in love" flooded them. They became part of that unreal but penetrating and exciting universe which is the world seen through the eyes of love. The sky stuck to them; the birds sang through them. And, what was even more exciting, she felt, too, as she saw Mr Ramsay bearing down and retreating, and Mrs Ramsay sitting with James in the window and the cloud moving and the tree bending, how life, from being made up of little separate incidents which one lived one by one, became curled and whole like a wave which bore one up and threw one down with it, there, with a dash on the beach.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr Bankes expected her to answer. And she was about to say something criticizing Mrs Ramsay, how she was alarming, too, in her way, high-handed, or words to that effect, when Mr Bankes made it entirely unnecessary for her to speak by his rapture. For such it was considering his age, turned sixty, and his cleanliness and his impersonality, and the white scientific coat which seemed to clothe him. For him to gaze as Lily saw him gazing at Mrs Ramsay was a rapture, equivalent, Lily felt, to the loves of dozens of young men (and perhaps Mrs Ramsay had never excited the loves of dozens of young men). It was love, she thought, pretending to move her canvas, distilled and filtered; love that never attempted to clutch its object; but, like the love which mathematicians bear their symbols, or poets their phrases, was meant to be spread over the world and become part of the human gain. So it was indeed. The world by all means should have shared it, could Mr Bankes have said why that woman pleased him so; why the sight of her reading a fairy tale to her boy had upon him precisely the same effect as the solution of a scientific problem, so that he rested in contemplation of it, and felt, as he felt when he had proved something absolute about the digestive system of plants, that barbarity was tamed, the reign of chaos subdued.</div>

<div class="line_en">Such a rapture -- for by what other name could one call it?-- made Lily Briscoe forget entirely what she had been about to say. It was nothing of importance; something about Mrs Ramsay. It paled beside this "rapture," this silent stare, for which she felt intense gratitude; for nothing so solaced her, eased her of the perplexity of life, and miraculously raised its burdens, as this sublime power, this heavenly gift, and one would no more disturb it, while it lasted, than break up the shaft of sunlight, lying level across the floor.</div>

<div class="line_en">She could have wept. It was bad, it was bad, it was infinitely bad! She could have done it differently of course; the colour could have been thinned and faded; the shapes etherealised; that was how Paunceforte would have seen it. But then she did not see it like that. She saw the colour burning on a framework of steel; the light of a butterfly's wing lying upon the arches of a cathedral. Of all that only a few random marks scrawled upon the canvas remained. And it would never be seen; never be hung even, and there was Mr Tansley whispering in her ear, "Women can't paint, women can't write…"</div>

<div class="line_en">She now remembered what she had been going to say about Mrs Ramsay. She did not know how she would have put it; but it would have been something critical. She had been annoyed the other night by some highhandedness. Looking along the level of Mr Bankes's glance at her, she thought that no woman could worship another woman in the way he worshipped; they could only seek shelter under the shade which Mr Bankes extended over them both. Looking along his beam she added to it her different ray, thinking that she was unquestionably the loveliest of people (bowed over her book); the best perhaps; but also, different too from the perfect shape which one saw there. But why different, and how different? she asked herself, scraping her palette of all those mounds of blue and green which seemed to her like clods with no life in them now, yet she vowed, she would inspire them, force them to move, flow, do her bidding tomorrow. How did she differ? What was the spirit in her, the essential thing, by which, had you found a crumpled glove in the corner of a sofa, you would have known it, from its twisted finger, hers indisputably? She was like a bird for speed, an arrow for directness. She was willful; she was commanding (of course, Lily reminded herself, I am thinking of her relations with women, and I am much younger, an insignificant person, living off the Brompton Road). She opened bedroom windows. She shut doors. (So she tried to start the tune of Mrs Ramsay in her head.) Arriving late at night, with a light tap on one's bedroom door, wrapped in an old fur coat (for the setting of her beauty was always that -- hasty, but apt), she would enact again whatever it might be -- Charles Tansley losing his umbrella; Mr Carmichael snuffling and sniffing; Mr Bankes saying, "The vegetable salts are lost." All this she would adroitly shape; even maliciously twist; and, moving over to the window, in pretence that she must go,-- it was dawn, she could see the sun rising,-- half turn back, more intimately, but still always laughing, insist that she must, Minta must, they all must marry, since in the whole world whatever laurels might be tossed to her (but Mrs Ramsay cared not a fig for her painting), or triumphs won by her (probably Mrs Ramsay had had her share of those), and here she saddened, darkened, and came back to her chair, there could be no disputing this: an unmarried woman (she lightly took her hand for a moment), an unmarried woman has missed the best of life. The house seemed full of children sleeping and Mrs Ramsay listening; shaded lights and regular breathing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时她想起了刚才正要说的关于拉姆齐夫人的话。她不知道自己会如何表达：但肯定会带有批评性质。那天晚上她的专横使自己很生气。她顺着班克斯先生看拉姆齐夫人的目光望去，心想没有哪个女人能够像他祟拜拉姆齐夫人那样祟拜另一个女人；她们只能一起在班克斯先生给予她们的庇荫下寻求安身立命之所。她沿着他的目光望去时把自己的不同的目光加了进去，一面心里在想，毫无疑问她是最漂亮的人（现在正低着头看书）：也许还是最好的人；可是仍和你在那里看到的完美的形态不同。但为什么不同，怎么个不同法？她问自己，一面把调色板上一堆堆蓝色绿色颜料刮去，她感到现在它们就像没有生命的泥土块，然而她发誓明天她要赋予它们以灵感，强近它们按她的意志动作、流淌。她究竟不同在何处？她的内在精神是什么？如果你在—张沙发的角落里发现了一只手套，从手套弯曲的手指上可以毫无疑问地断定这是拉姆齐夫人的，那么用什么来了解她的本质呢？在速度方面她如一只鸟，在直截了当方面她如一枝箭。她任性；她咄咄逼人（当然啦，莉莉提醒自己，我考虑的是她和女人间的关系，我比她年轻得多，是个小人物，住在布罗普顿街）。她打开卧室的窗子。她关上门。（她这样开始试图在脑子里想像拉姆齐夫人的生活情况，）她深夜到莉莉这里来，轻轻敲一下房门，身卜裹件旧皮大衣（她的美貌总是这样衬托出来的——匆匆而就，但恰到好处），她总是要把随便什么拿来表演一番——查尔斯·坦斯利丢了雨伞；卡迈克尔先生哼哧哼哧吸鼻子；班克斯先生说，“蔬菜失去了盐分”。这—切她都能熟练地学出来，甚至恶作剧地歪曲一番；然后她走到窗前，假装必需走了——已是黎明时分，她可以看见太阳正在升起——她半转过身子，更为亲密地但仍旧不断笑着坚持说，她一定得，明塔一定得，她们都一定得结婚。因为在这整个世界上，无论她得到什么样的荣誉的桂冠（但是拉姆齐夫人觉得她的画毫不足取），或获得了什么样的胜利（也许拉姆齐夫人曾有过自己的一份胜利）——说到此处她神情变得忧郁悲哀，回到椅子旁——无可争辩的一点是，一个没有结过婚的女人（她轻轻地把莉莉的手握了片刻）失去了人生最美好的部分。房子里似乎充满了熟睡的孩子，拉姆齐夫人在凝神倾听；充满了罩暗了的灯光和有规律的呼吸声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Oh, but, Lily would say, there was her father; her home; even, had she dared to say it, her painting. But all this seemed so little, so virginal, against the other. Yet, as the night wore on, and white lights parted the curtains, and even now and then some bird chirped in the garden, gathering a desperate courage she would urge her own exemption from the universal law; plead for it; she liked to be alone; she liked to be herself; she was not made for that; and so have to meet a serious stare from eyes of unparalleled depth, and confront Mrs Ramsay's simple certainty (and she was childlike now) that her dear Lily, her little Brisk, was a fool. Then, she remembered, she had laid her head on Mrs Ramsay's lap and laughed and laughed and laughed, laughed almost hysterically at the thought of Mrs Ramsay presiding with immutable calm over destinies which she completely failed to understand. There she sat, simple, serious. She had recovered her sense of her now -- this was the glove's twisted finger. But into what sanctuary had one penetrated? Lily Briscoe had looked up at last, and there was Mrs Ramsay, unwitting entirely what had caused her laughter, still presiding, but now with every trace of wilfulness abolished, and in its stead, something clear as the space which the clouds at last uncover -- the little space of sky which sleeps beside the moon.</div>

<div class="line_en">Was it wisdom? Was it knowledge? Was it, once more, the deceptiveness of beauty, so that all one's perceptions, half way to truth, were tangled in a golden mesh? or did she lock up within her some secret which certainly Lily Briscoe believed people must have for the world to go on at all? Every one could not be as helter skelter, hand to mouth as she was. But if they knew, could they tell one what they knew? Sitting on the floor with her arms round Mrs Ramsay's knees, close as she could get, smiling to think that Mrs Ramsay would never know the reason of that pressure, she imagined how in the chambers of the mind and heart of the woman who was, physically, touching her, were stood, like the treasures in the tombs of kings, tablets bearing sacred inscriptions, which if one could spell them out, would teach one everything, but they would never be offered openly, never made public. What art was there, known to love or cunning, by which one pressed through into those secret chambers? What device for becoming, like waters poured into one jar, inextricably the same, one with the object one adored? Could the body achieve, or the mind, subtly mingling in the intricate passages of the brain? or the heart? Could loving, as people called it, make her and Mrs Ramsay one? for it was not knowledge but unity that she desired, not inscriptions on tablets, nothing that could be written in any language known to men, but intimacy itself, which is knowledge, she had thought, leaning her head on Mrs Ramsay's knee.</div>

<div class="line_en">This ray passed level with Mr Bankes's ray straight to Mrs Ramsay sitting reading there with James at her knee. But now while she still looked, Mr Bankes had done. He had put on his spectacles. He had stepped back. He had raised his hand. He had slightly narrowed his clear blue eyes, when Lily, rousing herself, saw what he was at, and winced like a dog who sees a hand raised to strike it. She would have snatched her picture off the easel, but she said to herself, One must. She braced herself to stand the awful trial of some one looking at her picture. One must, she said, one must. And if it must be seen, Mr Bankes was less alarming than another. But that any other eyes should see the residue of her thirty-three years, the deposit of each day's living mixed with something more secret than she had ever spoken or shown in the course of all those days was an agony. At the same time it was immensely exciting.</div>

Only like a bee, drawn by some sweetness or sharpness in the air intangible to touch or taste, one haunted the dome-shaped hive, ranged the wastes of the air over the countries of the world alone, and then haunted the hives with their murmurs and their stirrings; the hives, which were people. Mrs Ramsay rose. Lily rose. Mrs Ramsay went. For days there hung about her, as after a dream some subtle change is felt in the person one has dreamt of, more vividly than anything she said, the sound of murmuring and, as she sat in the wicker arm-chair in the drawing-room window she wore, to Lily's eyes, an august shape; the shape of a dome.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was Mrs Ramsay reading to James, she said. She knew his objection -- that no one could tell it for a human shape. But she had made no attempt at likeness, she said. For what reason had she introduced them then? he asked. Why indeed?-- except that if there, in that corner, it was bright, here, in this, she felt the need of darkness. Simple, obvious, commonplace, as it was, Mr Bankes was interested. Mother and child then -- objects of universal veneration, and in this case the mother was famous for her beauty -- might be reduced, he pondered, to a purple shadow without irreverence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="是拉姆齐夫人结詹姆斯念故事，她说。她知道他反对的理由——没人能看出这是个人的形状。但她并没有企图画得和真人一样，她说。那么她为什么要画他们呢？他问。真的，为什么呢？———只不过因为如果在那里，在那个角落里，光线很明亮，这里，在这边，她感到需要暗的色调。尽管道理简单、明显、平常，班克斯先生却很感兴趣。那么这就是母与子了——这是受到普遍祟敬的对象。而此处还是个以美貌著称的母亲——竟然可以将其简化为一团紫色的阴影而毫无不敬的感觉，他心中默想道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But the picture was not of them, she said. Or, not in his sense. There were other senses too in which one might reverence them. By a shadow here and a light there, for instance. Her tribute took that form if, as she vaguely supposed, a picture must be a tribute. A mother and child might be reduced to a shadow without irreverence. A light here required a shadow there. He considered. He was interested. He took it scientifically in complete good faith. The truth was that all his prejudices were on the other side, he explained. The largest picture in his drawing-room, which painters had praised, and valued at a higher price than he had given for it, was of the cherry trees in blossom on the banks of the Kennet. He had spent his honeymoon on the banks of the Kennet, he said. Lily must come and see that picture, he said. But now -- he turned, with his glasses raised to the scientific examination of her canvas. The question being one of the relations of masses, of lights and shadows, which, to be honest, he had never considered before, he would like to have it explained -- what then did she wish to make of it? And he indicated the scene before them. She looked. She could not show him what she wished to make of it, could not see it even herself, without a brush in her hand. She took up once more her old painting position with the dim eyes and the absent-minded manner, subduing all her impressions as a woman to something much more general; becoming once more under the power of that vision which she had seen clearly once and must now grope for among hedges and houses and mothers and children -- her picture. It was a question, she remembered, how to connect this mass on the right hand with that on the left. She might do it by bringing the line of the branch across so; or break the vacancy in the foreground by an object (James perhaps) so. But the danger was that by doing that the unity of the whole might be broken. She stopped; she did not want to bore him; she took the canvas lightly off the easel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是这幅画画的不是他们，她说，至少不是从他理解的意义上的他们。人们还可以从别的意义上崇敬他们。比如说，用这里一块阴影、那儿一道亮色来表示。如果像她隐约感到的那样一幅画必然是一种敬意的表示，她的敬意就是用这种形式表现出来的。母与子可以被简化成一团阴影而毫无不敬之意。这里的一片亮色需要那儿有一片阴影。他思考着。他很感兴趣！他真诚地以科学的态度来理解她的话，事实是，他的偏见完全是另一方面的，他解释道。他客厅里最大的一幅画得到了画家们的赞扬，估计比他买的时候要值钱，画面上是肯尼特河畔繁花似锦的樱桃树：他说他是在肯尼特河畔度的蜜月。莉莉一定要来看看那幅画，他说。不过现在——他转过身去，把眼镜推到脑门上，用科学的眼光来审视她画布上的画。问题的关键是画面布局、光和阴影间的关系，而这方面，老实说，他以前从未考虑过，他希望能给他解释一下——她究竟打算如何处理这画面？他指了指眼前的景象。她看着这景象。她无法使他明白她打算如何处理，手里没有画笔时连她自己都看不出要如何处理。她重新摆出了绘画时习惯的姿势，目光朦胧、心不在焉，压抑下她作为女人的所有印象，集中在更具一般性的事物上；又一次处于那强有力的景象的支配之下，她曾经清清楚楚地看到过它一次，而现在却必须在树篱、房屋、母亲们和孩子们之间到处搜寻——她的画面。她记起来了，问题在如何把右边的布局和左边的联系起来。她可以把树枝的线条这样画过来；或者用一个物体（也许是詹姆斯）填补上前景的空白。但这样做的危险是可能破坏了整体的协调。她打住话头；她不想惹他厌烦；她轻轻从画架上把画布取了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But it had been seen; it had been taken from her. This man had shared with her something profoundly intimate. And, thanking Mr Ramsay for it and Mrs Ramsay for it and the hour and the place, crediting the world with a power which she had not suspected -- that one could walk away down that long gallery not alone any more but arm in arm with somebody -- the strangest feeling in the world, and the most exhilarating -- she nicked the catch of her paint-box to, more firmly than was necessary, and the nick seemed to surround in a circle forever the paint-box, the lawn, Mr Bankes, and that wild villain, Cam, dashing past.</div>
