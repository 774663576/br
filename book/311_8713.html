<div class="line_en">She remembered her books today, and she was wearing fresh clothes. She'd had to wash her jeans out in the bathtub last night, so they were still kind of damp… But altogether, Eleanor felt a thousand times better than she had yesterday. Even her hair was halfway cooperating. She'd clumped it up into a bun and wrapped it with a rubber band. It was going to hurt like crazy trying to tear the rubber band out, but at least it was staying for now.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was something about the music on that tape. It felt different. Like, it set her lungs and her stomach on edge. There was something exciting about it, and something nervous. It made Eleanor feel like everything, like the world, wasn't what she'd thought it was. And that was a good thing. That was the greatest thing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="磁带里的音乐很有意思。与众不同，好像会搅动她的心肝肺，令人既兴奋又紧张不安。埃莉诺觉得眼前的整个世界都跟她原来想象的不同了。这是好事，是最好不过的事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She looked up at his face, even though she knew how that was going to feel, like someone was hooking her insides out through her chest. "No. It was awesome. I didn't want to stop listening. That one song -- is it 'Love Will Tear Us Apart'?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她明知一旦抬头看他，自己的心肝肺就会被整个掏出来，但还是抬起头，看着他说：“不，是真的帅呆了。我真想一直听下去。那首——是叫《爱将再次撕裂我们》吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She handed him yesterday's comics, then tugged nervously at the green ribbon wound round her wrist. She couldn't think of what to say. She started to worry that maybe she wouldn't say anything, that she wouldn't even thank him…</div>
