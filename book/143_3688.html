<div class="line_en">One such evening, listening to his father talk of the old days in America, the idea had come to him. Salvatore Senior was drinking wine and swapping tales with an old and trusted friend who had been in America also and had returned to Sicily with him, and they good-naturedly reproached each other for being so stupid. The other man, a carpenter named Alfio Dorio, reminded Guiliano's father of their first few years in America before they had worked for the Godfather, Don Corleone. They had been hired to help build a huge tunnel under a river, either to New Jersey or to Long Island, they quarreled about that. They reminisced about how eerie it was to work beneath a flowing river, their dread that the tubes holding out the water would collapse and they would drown like rats. And suddenly it came to Guiliano. These two men with some trusted helpers could build a tunnel from his parents' house to the base of the mountains only a hundred yards away. The exit could be hidden by the huge granite rocks and the source of the tunnel in the house could be hidden in one of the closets or beneath the stove in the kitchen. If that could be done Guiliano might come and go as he pleased.</div>

<div class="line_en">The two older men told him that it was impossible, but his mother was wild with pleasure at the idea that her son could secretly come and sleep in his bed on cold winter nights. Alfio Dorio said that given the necessity for secrecy, the limited amount of men who could be used, and since the work could only be done at night, it would take too long to complete such a tunnel. And then there were problems. How would they get rid of the dirt excavated without being observed? And the soil here was full of stones. What if they came up against a strain of granite underground? And then what if the tunnel were betrayed by some of the men recruited to work on it? But the persistent objection of the two older men was that it would take at least a year. And Guiliano realized that they harped on this because they believed in their heart of hearts that he would not be alive so long. His mother realized the same thing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两个老人告诉他这是不可能的，但是他母亲听到这个想法后欣喜不已，因为这样一来，在寒冷的冬天，她儿子就可以偷偷地回家，在他自己的床上睡觉了。阿尔菲奥·多里奥说，就算能保住密，能够帮忙的人也很有限，而且这只能在晚上干，挖这样一条地道需要花的时间太长了。还有其他一些问题。比如，他们挖出来的土倒在哪里才不会引起别人注意？再说了，这里的土层中石头太多。如果在地下碰到大块的花岗岩怎么办？如果被请来帮忙的人中有人把地道的事说出去了怎么办？这两个老人之所以持反对意见，主要是考虑到至少要花上一年的时间。吉里安诺注意到，他们反复说这个问题，是因为他们内心深处觉得他活不了那么长时间。他母亲也意识到这个问题。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She said to the two older men: "My son asks you to do something that may help save his life. If you are too lazy to do so, then I will. We can try at least. What do we have to lose except our labor? And what can the authorities do even if they discover the tunnel? We have a perfect right to dig on our land. We'll say we're making a cellar for vegetables and wine. Just think. This tunnel may someday save Turi's life. Isn't that worth some sweat?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Hector Adonis was also present. Adonis said he would get some books on excavation and the necessary equipment. He also came up with a variation that pleased them all: that they build a little offshoot tunnel that would lead into another house on the Via Bella, an escape hatch in case the exit of the tunnel was compromised or betrayed by an informer. This offshoot tunnel would be dug first, and only by the two old men and Maria Lombardo. Nobody else would know about it. And it would not take so long to dig.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="赫克特·阿多尼斯当时也在场，他说他去弄一些挖掘地道的书和必要设备。他还提出了一个使大家都很高兴的想法：挖一条通贝拉大街另一幢房子的小暗道，万一地道口暴露或被人告密，就用它作为备用出口。这条暗道先挖，由两位老人和玛丽亚·隆巴尔多来。这样别人就不会知道，而且挖的时间也不会太长。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hector Adonis volunteered his house but it was too far away, and Guiliano did not want to endanger his godfather. For if the tunnel was discovered the owner of the house would surely be arrested. Other relatives and friends were considered and rejected, and then finally Guiliano's mother said, "There is only one person. She lives alone, just four houses down the street. Her husband was killed by the carabinieri, she hates them. She is my best friend and she is fond of Turi, she has watched him grow from a boy to a man. Didn't she send him food all the winter he spent in the mountains? She is my true friend and I have complete trust in her."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="赫克特·阿多尼斯主动提出通到他家的房子，可是那地方有些远了，而且吉里安诺也不想牵连他的教父，因为一旦地道被发现，房主人肯定会遭到逮捕。他们考虑了其他的亲戚，但都被否定了。最后吉里安诺的母亲说：“只有一个人。她一个人独居，就在这条街往下的第四家。她丈夫被宪兵打死了，她对他们恨之入骨。她是我最好的朋友，而且她特别喜欢图里。她是看着图里从小长大的。图里在大山里度过了整整一个冬天，她也送去了食物，她是我真正的朋友，我充分信任她。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They had a long discussion on which house was trustworthy. Guiliano's father suggested the home of Aspanu Pisciotta's parents, but this was immediately vetoed by Guiliano. The house was too suspect, would be closely watched. And there were too many relatives living in that house. Too many people would know. Besides, Aspanu was not on good terms with his family. His natural father had died, and when his mother remarried he had never forgiven her.</div>

<div class="line_en">She paused for a moment and then said, "La Venera." And of course since the discussion had begun, they had been waiting for her to say that name. From the first, La Venera had been the only logical choice in all their minds. But they were Sicilian males and could not make such a suggestion. If La Venera agreed and the story came out, her reputation would be ruined forever. She was a young widow. She would be granting her privacy and her person to a young male. Who could ever doubt that she would lose her virtue? No man in that part of Sicily could marry or even respect such a woman. It was true that La Venera was at least fifteen years older than Turi Guiliano. But she was not yet forty. And though her face was not beautiful, it was attractive enough, and there was a certain fire in her eyes. In any case she was female and he was male and with the tunnel they would be alone together. There could not therefore be any doubt that they would become lovers, for no Sicilian believed that any male and female alone together, no matter what difference in age, could refrain. And so the tunnel into her house that perhaps might one day save Turi Guiliano's life would also mark her as a woman of ill repute. What they all understood except for Turi Guiliano himself was that Guiliano's sexual chastity worried them. It was not natural in a Sicilian male. He was almost prudish. His band of men went to Palermo to visit whores; Aspanu Pisciotta had scandalous love affairs. His bandit chiefs Terranova and Passatempo were known to be the lovers of poor widows to whom they gave gifts. Passatempo even had a reputation as a man who used persuasion more typical of rapist than suitor, though he trod carefully now that he was under Guiliano's orders. Guiliano had decreed execution for any of his men who raped.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她略作停顿后接着说：“拉韦内拉。”自打开始讨论，他们就在等她说出这个名字。从一开始，拉韦内拉就是他们头脑中唯一合乎逻辑的人选。因为他们是西西里的男人，不能提出这样的建议。如果事情传出去，她从此就会声名狼藉。她是个年轻寡妇。这样一来，她就等于把自己的隐私和自己本身交给了一个年轻男子。谁能相信她没有失德？在西西里这个地方，没有哪个男人会跟这样一个女人结婚，甚至没有人会尊重她。虽然拉韦内拉比吉里安诺至少要大十五岁，可是她还不到四十岁，她长得不算漂亮，但还有几分姿色，她的眼睛中闪烁着欲望的火。不管怎么说，她是一个女人，而他是一个男人。有了这条地道，他们就可以单独在一起，因此他们肯定会成为情人。西西里人相信，一个男人和一个女人无论年龄相差多大，只要单独在一起，都没法克制自己。所以，把地道通到她的家里，也许有一天能救图里·吉里安诺的命，可是她肯定要落一个坏名声。吉里安诺洁身自好，这使大家都感到担心，不过他本人还不理解这一点。这种情况在一个西西里男子的身上极为少见，他太拘谨了。他手下的人是巴勒莫妓院的常客，阿斯帕努·皮肖塔的风流韵事臭名远扬，泰拉诺瓦和帕萨藤珀都是穷寡妇的情人，经常会接济她们一些东西。即使有了吉里安诺的警告在先，帕萨藤珀收服女人的手段还是更像强奸犯，而非追求者。吉里安诺下令说手下人只要强奸妇女，就会被枪毙。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For all these reasons they had to wait for Guiliano's mother to put forth the name of her friend, and they were a little surprised when she did so. Maria Lombardo Guiliano was a religious, old-fashioned woman who did not hesitate to call the young girls of the town whores if they so much as took a stroll in the village square without a chaperone. They did not know what Maria Lombardo knew. That La Venera, because of the sufferings of childbirth, the lack of proper medical care, could no longer become pregnant. They could not know that Maria Lombardo had already decided that La Venera could best comfort her son in the safest possible way. Her son was an outlaw with a price on his head and could easily be betrayed by a woman. He was young and virile and needed a woman -- who better than an older woman who could not bear children, and who could not make any claims for marriage? And indeed would not want to marry a bandit. She had had her fill of that misery. A husband shot down before her eyes. It was a perfect arrangement. Only La Venera's reputation would suffer, and so she would have to make the decision herself. It would be on her head if she agreed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="出于这些原因，他们才等吉里安诺母亲把她这位朋友的名字说出来。而当她说了之后，他们都感到有些惊讶。玛丽亚·隆巴尔多·吉里安诺是个保守的信徒，如果年轻女孩无人陪伴在镇子的广场上散步，她就会毫不犹豫地说她们是婊子。他们不知道玛丽亚·隆巴尔多所了解的内情：拉韦内拉由于难产，加之没有适当的医疗保健，已经失去了生育能力。他们不可能知道，玛丽亚·隆巴尔多已经认定，拉韦内拉可以用最安全的方式给她儿子带来最大的快乐。她的儿子是个土匪，当局悬赏要他的人头，很容易被女人出卖。他年纪轻，精力充沛，需要有一个女人——一个年纪大一些、没有生育能力的女人，而且不会提出结婚的要求，这有什么不好？谁愿意跟一个土匪结婚呢？她有过自己的悲惨经历，她的丈夫被人在她的眼前枪杀。这将是一个很好的安排。只是拉韦内拉的名声会受影响，所以这个决定必须由她自己作出。如果她同意，那说明她心甘情愿地认了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The offshoot was disguised by a wooden panel covered with a foot of dirt so that workers on the main tunnel would not know it existed. Guiliano had to dig away the dirt and remove the wooden disc. It took him another fifteen minutes to crawl through the narrow space that led under La Venera's house. The trapdoor there led to the kitchen and was covered by a huge iron stove. Guiliano tapped on the trapdoor with the prearranged signal and waited. He tapped again. He never feared bullets, but he feared this darkness. Finally there was a faint noise above him and then the trapdoor was raised. It could not rise all the way because the stove above it broke the plane of the lid. Guiliano had to squeeze through the opening and wound up on his belly on La Venera's kitchen floor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="支线地道入口盖着一块木板，上面覆了一英尺的土加以伪装，这样挖主干地道的人就不会知道还有另外一条地道。吉里安诺不得不先把土挖掉，然后搬开那块木板。又过了十五分钟，他才从狭小的地道爬到拉韦内拉家的房子下面。它的出口在厨房，出口上面摆了一只很大的铁炉子。吉里安诺用约定的暗号敲了敲活动门板，然后静静地等待。接着他又敲了几下。他从来不害怕子弹，可是他害怕这样的黑暗。终于头顶上方传来轻微的响声，接着活动门板被提了上去。但是由于那只炉子压着，门板不能平着向上提。吉里安诺只好从露出的那个开口挤上去，最后是肚皮紧贴着拉韦内拉家厨房的地面爬出来的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Guiliano's mother made that request a few days later she was surprised when La Venera gave a proud and joyful yes. It confirmed a suspicion that her friend had a weakness for Turi. So be it, Maria Lombardo thought as she took La Venera into her arms with grateful tears. The offshoot tunnel was completed in four months; the main tunnel would not be completed for another year. Periodically Guiliano would sneak into town at night and visit his family and sleep in a warm bed, after his mother's hot meals; there would always be a feast. But it was nearly spring before he found it necessary to use the offshoot tunnel. A carabinieri patrol in strength came down the Via Bella and passed by. They were armed to the teeth. Guiliano's bodyguard of four men hidden in nearby houses was ready to do battle. But they passed on. Still there was the fear that on their return they might decide to raid the Guiliano home. So Turi Guiliano went through the trapdoor in his parents' bedroom and into the tunnel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几天以后，吉里安诺的母亲向她提出这个要求的时候，她惊讶地发现拉韦内拉自豪而兴奋地答应了。这也验证了她的怀疑，那就是她的朋友喜欢图里。玛丽亚·隆巴尔多眼里闪着感激的泪花，把拉韦内拉拥在自己的怀里，心想那就听天由命了吧。四个月后，这条支线地道完工。主干地道要再用一年时间才能完成。每隔一段时间，吉里安诺就在夜里悄悄地回到镇上，看望自己的家人，每次母亲都给他准备一顿丰盛的饭菜，吃完这顿热饭之后，他就在那张温暖的床上好好睡一觉。快到春天的时候，吉里安诺发现有必要使用那条支线地道了。有一天，一支几乎全副武装的宪兵队在贝拉大街上巡逻。吉里安诺的四个保镖就隐蔽在附近的房子里，他们已经做好了战斗准备。但是巡逻队走过去了。尽管如此，他们还是害怕巡逻队会对吉里安诺的家杀个回马枪。于是图里·吉里安诺从父母亲卧室的出入口钻进了地道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Though it was the middle of the night, La Venera was still in her usual ill-fitting black dress, the mourning for her husband though he was three years dead. Her feet were bare. She wore no stockings, and as Guiliano rose from the floor he could see the skin on her legs was a startling white, so very much in contrast to the brown skin of her sunburned face and the jet black, coarse and heavily woven hair. For the first time he noticed that her face was not as broad as that of most of the older women in his town, that it was triangular, and though her eyes were dark brown, they had little black flecks in them he had never seen before. In her hand she held a scuttle full of live coals as if ready to throw them at the open trapdoor. Now she calmly slid the coals back into the stove and replaced the lid. She looked a little frightened.</div>

<div class="line_en">They waited. La Venera made him coffee and they chatted. She noted that he did not have any of the nervous movements of her husband. He did not peer out the windows, his body did not tense at sudden noises in the street. He seemed completely relaxed. She did not know he had trained himself to act this way because of her stories about her husband and because he did not want to alarm his parents, especially his mother.

He thanked her and said how he and his companions had fallen on her food packets as if they were gifts from the Magi. How his men had complimented her cooking. He did not tell her of the coarse jokes some of his companions had made, that if her lovemaking equaled her cooking she would be a prize indeed. Meanwhile he was watching her closely. She was not being as friendly to him as usual; she did not show that fond tenderness she had always shown in public. He wondered if he had offended her in some way.

The winter was near its end, but the mountains were filled with storm gales and the padlocked shrines of saints along the roads were dripping with rain. Guiliano in his cave dreamed of his mother's cooking, a hot bath, his soft bed in his childhood room. And mixed with these longings, much to his surprise, was the memory of the white skin of La Venera's legs. Night had fallen when he whistled up to his bodyguards and took the road down to Montelepre.</div>

<div class="line_en">When La Venera saw him, she laughed and it was the first time Guiliano could ever remember her laughing. "You look like a Moor," she said. And for a moment he felt a child's hurt, perhaps because the Moors were always the villains in the puppet shows of Sicily, and instead of being a hero in danger of his life, he could be seen as a villain. Or perhaps because her laugh made her seem inaccessible to his inner desire. She saw that in some way she had injured his vanity. "I'll fill the bath tin and you can get clean," she said. "And I have some of my husband's clothes you can wear while I clean yours."</div>

His death had been certain, once he had turned bandit, and every day she had waited, hoping he would die in the mountains or some far-off town. But he had been shot down before her eyes. And ever since she had been unable to escape the shame, not of his being a bandit, but of his dying an inglorious and not a brave death.

But the last year of commanding and killing men made his natural boyish fear seem more like a joke, the rejection by a woman not so paralyzing to his ego.

On these tables were photographs of her dead husband and dead child, singly and together. Some were of La Venera with her family. The photos were framed in black oval wood, the prints tinged with sepia brown. Guiliano was surprised by the beauty of La Venera in these younger, happier days, especially when she was dressed in pretty, youthful clothes.

<div class="line_en">Rutillo Candeleria had been a handsome man. He had a high forehead surmounted by wavy chestnut hair carefully cut, and Guiliano wondered if his wife had cut it for him. His face was adorned with full cavalry mustaches which made him seem older, though he had only been thirty-five when the carabinieri shot him. Now his face looked down from the oval portrait almost kindly, in a benediction. Only the eyes and mouth betrayed his ferocity. And yet at the same time there was a resignation in that face, as if he knew what his fate must be. Like all who raised their hands against the world and tore from it what they wished by violence and murder, like others who made personal law and tried to rule society with it. he must come finally to sudden death.</div>

Guiliano felt La Venera's legs pressed against his back; her heat came through the rough cotton of her dress. When she moved in front of him to cut around his forehead she kept well away from his leg, but when she had to lean forward, the swelling of her bust almost brushed against his lips and the clean heavy scent of her body made his face as warm as if he were standing before a fire.

<div class="line_en">For that first moment, Guiliano lost all sense of himself and his world. La Venera's body was so lush, and it burned with a tropical heat that went to his very bones. Her breasts were fuller than he could ever have imagined; the black widow's dress had cleverly disguised and protected them. At the sight of those oval globes of flesh he felt the blood pounding in his head. And then they were on the floor making love and taking off their clothing at the same time. She kept whispering, "Turi, Turi," in an agonized voice, but he said nothing. He was lost in the smell, the heat and fleshiness of her body.

She had turned her back because she could not bear the fearful nervousness of her husband when he was in the house, his terror of being trapped so that he could never fall asleep, the way he started up if she rose from the bed to cook or do some chore. She marveled now at Guiliano's calm; she loved him for it. She loved him because, unlike her husband, he did not bring his guns to bed, he did not interrupt his lovemaking to listen for the sound of lurking enemies, he did not smoke or drink and tell his fears.

La Venera looked ten years younger. Her dark brown eyes had black flecks dancing in them, her cheeks were rosy with color, and for the first time in almost four years she wore a dress that was not black. It was the frilly dress beribboned with velvet that a girl wears to show the mother of her lover. Maria Lombardo felt a rush of gratitude for her friend, for her loyalty and her courage and also a certain satisfaction that her plans had come out so well. This would be a wonderful arrangement for her son, a woman who would never be a traitor, a woman who could never make a permanent claim upon him. Though she loved her son fiercely she felt no jealousy. Except when La Venera told how she had cooked her best dish, a pie stuffed with rabbit meat and chunks of strong cheese riddled with fat grains of pepper, and how Turi had devoured enough for five men and sworn he had never eaten anything better in his life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她一直等到中午才到吉里安诺家里去看他母亲。玛丽亚·隆巴尔多一看她的脸就知道发生了什么。拉韦内拉看起来年轻了十岁。她那深棕色的眼睛炯炯有神，双颊透着玫瑰红色，而且四年来第一次没有穿黑裙子。这是一条带花边、配丝绒腰带的裙子。姑娘们穿上这样的裙子是为了告诉母亲她们有了意中人。玛丽亚·隆巴尔多的感激之情油然而生，她感谢这个朋友，感谢她的忠诚、她的勇气，同时对自己的计划成功实现感到满意。对她儿子来说，这是个极好的安排，因为这个女人永远不会背叛他，永远不会对他说她怀孕了。虽然隆巴尔多很爱自己的儿子，但她并没有产生嫉妒。如果说有，那只是因为拉韦内拉说她做了最拿手的食物，撒着饱满花椒粒的兔肉奶酪馅饼，图里一口气吃了足够五个人吃的分量，还说自己一辈子也没吃过比这个更好吃的东西。">查看中文翻译</div>
