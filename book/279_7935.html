<div class="line_en">One of the reasons why Tom's mind had drifted away from its secret troubles was, that it had found a new and weighty matter to interest itself about. Becky Thatcher had stopped coming to school. Tom had struggled with his pride a few days, and tried to "whistle her down the wind," but failed. He began to find himself hanging around her father's house, nights, and feeling very miserable. She was ill. What if she should die! There was distraction in the thought. He no longer took an interest in war, nor even in piracy. The charm of life was gone; there was nothing but dreariness left. He put his hoop away, and his bat; there was no joy in them any more. His aunt was concerned. She began to try all manner of remedies on him. She was one of those people who are infatuated with patent medicines and all new–fangled methods of producing health or mending it. She was an inveterate experimenter in these things. When something fresh in this line came out she was in a fever, right away, to try it; not on herself, for she was never ailing, but on anybody else that came handy. She was a subscriber for all the "Health" periodicals and phrenological frauds; and the solemn ignorance they were inflated with was breath to her nostrils. All the "rot" they contained about ventilation, and how to go to bed, and how to get up, and what to eat, and what to drink, and how much exercise to take, and what frame of mind to keep one's self in, and what sort of clothing to wear, was all gospel to her, and she never observed that her health–journals of the current month customarily upset everything they had recommended the month before. She was as simple–hearted and honest as the day was long, and so she was an easy victim. She gathered together her quack periodicals and her quack medicines, and thus armed with death, went about on her pale horse, metaphorically speaking, with "hell following after." But she never suspected that she was not an angel of healing and the balm of Gilead in disguise, to the suffering neighbors.</div>

<div class="line_en">The water treatment was new, now, and Tom's low condition was a windfall to her. She had him out at daylight every morning, stood him up in the woodshed and drowned him with a deluge of cold water; then she scrubbed him down with a towel like a file, and so brought him to; then she rolled him up in a wet sheet and put him away under blankets till she sweated his soul clean and "the yellow stains of it came through his pores" -- as Tom said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="时下，水疗法是个新玩意，正巧汤姆精神也不怎么样，这下可得了她的劲。早晨天一亮，她就把汤姆叫到外边，让他在木棚里站好，然后没头没脸地给他浇上一阵凉水。她还用毛巾像锉东西一样使劲给汤姆擦身，让他缓过来。接着她用湿床单包起汤姆，再盖上毯子直捂得他大汗淋漓，洗净灵魂。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yet notwithstanding all this, the boy grew more and more melancholy and pale and dejected. She added hot baths, sitz baths, shower baths, and plunges. The boy remained as dismal as a hearse. She began to assist the water with a slim oatmeal diet and blister–plasters. She calculated his capacity as she would a jug's, and filled him up every day with quack cure–alls.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tom had become indifferent to persecution by this time. This phase filled the old lady's heart with consternation. This indifference must be broken up at any cost. Now she heard of Pain–killer for the first time. She ordered a lot at once. She tasted it and was filled with gratitude. It was simply fire in a liquid form. She dropped the water treatment and everything else, and pinned her faith to Pain–killer. She gave Tom a teaspoonful and watched with the deepest anxiety for the result. Her troubles were instantly at rest, her soul at peace again; for the "indifference" was broken up. The boy could not have shown a wilder, heartier interest, if she had built a fire under him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tom felt that it was time to wake up; this sort of life might be romantic enough, in his blighted condition, but it was getting to have too little sentiment and too much distracting variety about it. So he thought over various plans for relief, and finally hit pon that of professing to be fond of Pain–killer. He asked for it so often that he became a nuisance, and his aunt ended by telling him to help himself and quit bothering her. If it had been Sid, she would have had no misgivings to alloy her delight; but since it was Tom, she watched the bottle clandestinely. She found that the medicine did really diminish, but it did not occur to her that the boy was mending the health of a crack in the sitting–room floor with it.</div>

<div class="line_en">Peter was agreeable. So Tom pried his mouth open and poured down the Pain–killer. Peter sprang a couple of yards in the air, and then delivered a war–whoop and set off round and round the room, banging against furniture, upsetting flower–pots, and making general havoc. Next he rose on his hind feet and pranced around, in a frenzy of enjoyment, with his head over his shoulder and his voice proclaiming his unappeasable happiness. Then he went tearing around the house again spreading chaos and destruction in his path. Aunt Polly entered in time to see him throw a few double summersets, deliver a final mighty hurrah, and sail through the open window, carrying the rest of the flower–pots with him. The old lady stood petrified with astonishment, peering over her glasses; Tom lay on the floor expiring with laughter.</div>

<div class="line_en">Aunt Polly felt a sudden pang of remorse. This was putting the thing in a new light; what was cruelty to a cat MIGHT be cruelty to a boy, too. She began to soften; she felt sorry. Her eyes watered a little, and she put her hand on Tom's head and said gently:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="听到这，波莉姨妈突然感到一阵难受，后悔不已。汤姆的说法让她开了窍。猫受不了，那孩子不也同样受不了吗？她软下来，心里感到内疚。她眼睛有点湿润，手放在汤姆头上，亲切地说：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tom reached school ahead of time. It was noticed that this strange thing had been occurring every day latterly. And now, as usual of late, he hung about the gate of the schoolyard instead of playing with his comrades. He was sick, he said, and he looked it. He tried to seem to be looking everywhere but whither he really was looking-down the road. Presently Jeff Thatcher hove in sight, and Tom's face lighted; he gazed a moment, and then turned sorrowfully away. When Jeff arrived, Tom accosted him; and "led up" warily to opportunities for remark about Becky, but the giddy lad never could see the bait. Tom watched and watched, hoping whenever a frisking frock came in sight, and hating the owner of it as soon as he saw she was not the right one. At last frocks ceased to appear, and he dropped hopelessly into the dumps; he entered the empty schoolhouse and sat down to suffer. Then one more frock passed in at the gate, and Tom's heart gave a great bound. The next instant he was out, and "going on" like an Indian; yelling, laughing, chasing boys, jumping over the fence at risk of life and limb, throwing handsprings, standing on his head-doing all the heroic things he could conceive of, and keeping a furtive eye out, all the while, to see if Becky Thatcher was noticing. But she seemed to be unconscious of it all; she never looked. Could it be possible that she was not aware that he was there? He carried his exploits to her immediate vicinity; came war–whooping around, snatched a boy's cap, hurled it to the roof of the schoolhouse, broke through a group of boys, tumbling them in every direction, and fell sprawling, himself, under Becky's nose, almost upsetting her-and she turned, with her nose in the air, and he heard her say: "Mf! some people think they're mighty smart-always showing off!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汤姆早早来到学校，人们发现，奇怪的是他最近每天都是这样。和往常一样，他没跟伙伴们在一起玩耍，而是独自一人在校门口徘徊。他说自己病了，看上去也确实像生病的样子。他装出若无其事的样子四处看着。其实，他真正关注的是那边的那条路。这时，杰夫·撒切尔跃入眼帘，汤姆喜上眉梢，他盯着看了一会，然后失望地转过身去。等杰夫走近，汤姆主动上前同他搭讪，想俟机套出有关贝基的情况，可是谈了一通却是白搭。汤姆只好等啊等啊，等得望眼欲穿。每当路那头出现了女孩子模样时，他都满心欢喜，等到近处一看，不是他要等的人，他马上恨得咬牙切齿。后来，路上踪影全无，他的希望破灭了，所以他闷闷不乐地步进空无一人的教室，坐在那里难过。这时，汤姆看见女孩的衣服从大门口飘进来，汤姆的心怦怦直跳，他马上跑出教室，像印第安人一样，开始登场表演。他叫着，笑着，你追我赶，甚至不顾摔断手脚，冒着生命危险跳过栅栏，前后翻个不停或者拿大顶。总之，凡是他能想到的逞能事情，他都做了。他一边做，一边偷眼看看贝基·撒切尔是不是看见了这一切。可是她好像一点也没看见，甚至连望一眼都没有。这可能因为她没有注意到他在那里。于是汤姆就凑近了一些，“冲啊！杀呀”地喊个不停。他跑着抓下一个男孩子的帽子就扔到教室的屋顶上，然后又冲向另一群孩子，弄得他们跌跌撞撞四散开去，自己也一下子摔在贝基面前，还差点把她绊倒。贝基转过身去，昂着头。汤姆听见她说：“哼！有的人自以为是，神气得很呢——尽是卖弄！”">查看中文翻译</div>
