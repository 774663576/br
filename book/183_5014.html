<div class="line_en">On an evening of startling beauty, when the sunset behind them was so crimson and purple and widely spread that the very sky itself seemed to have grown larger, they came in sight of land on their starboard bow. It came slowly nearer and the light behind them made it look as if the capes and headlands of this new country were all on fire. But presently they were sailing along its coast and its western cape now rose up astern of them, black against the red sky and sharp as if it was cut out of cardboard, and then they could see better what this country was like. It had no mountains but many gentle hills with slopes like pillows. An attractive smell came from it -- what Lucy called "a dim, purple kind of smell", which Edmund said (and Rhince thought) was rot, but Caspian said, "I know what you mean."</div>

<div class="line_en">The wind never failed but it grew gentler every day till at length the waves were little more than ripples, and the ship glided on hour after hour almost as if they were sailing on a lake. And every night they saw that there rose in the east new constellations which no one had ever seen in Narnia and perhaps, as Lucy thought with a mixture of joy and fear, no living eye had seen at all. Those new stars were big and bright and the nights were warm. Most of them slept on deck and talked far into the night or hung over the ship's side watching the luminous dance of the foam thrown up by their bows.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="风虽没停过，却一天比一天小，到最后浪花变成了涟漪那么大小，船一个小时接着一个小时悄悄行驶着，仿佛行驶在湖面上似的。每夜他们都看见东方升起新的星辰，在纳尼亚可没人见过这种星辰，正如露茜心里惊喜交加地琢磨着的，也许任何人的肉眼都根本没见过吧。那些新星又大又亮，夜间天气暖和，他们大半人睡在甲板上，有的一直谈到深更半夜，有的在船舷徘徊，观看船头激起的灿烂泡沫翩然起舞。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They sailed on a good way, past point after point, hoping to find a nice deep harbour, but had to content themselves in the end with a wide and shallow bay. Though it had seemed calm out at sea there was of course surf breaking on the sand and they could not bring the Dawn Treader as far in as they would have liked. They dropped anchor a good way from the beach and had a wet and tumbling landing in the boat. The Lord Rhoop remained on board the Dawn Treader. He wished to see no more islands. All the time that they remained in this country the sound of the long breakers was in their ears.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们开了好长一段路程，开过一个小岬又一个小岬，只指望找一个深水良港，可是末了只得在一个又宽又浅的海滩将就一下。虽然外边海面上风平浪静，可是不消说，沙滩上还是有拍岸碎浪，他们没法把黎明踏浪者号按照心意中那样深入开进去，只好在离开海滩老远处抛锚，再坐小船，弄得身上透湿，跌跌撞撞地上了岸。罗普爵爷依然留在黎明踏浪者号上。他不希望再看见什么岛屿了。他们留在这岛上的时候，耳边一直听到长长的碎浪拍岸的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Two men were left to guard the boat and Caspian led the others inland, but not far because it was too late for exploring and the light would soon go. But there was no need to go far to find an adventure. The level valley which lay at the head of the bay showed no road or track or other sign of habitation. Underfoot was tine springy turf dotted here and there with a low bushy growth which Edmund and Lucy took for heather. Eustace, who was really rather good at botany; said it wasn't, and he was probably right; but it was something of very much the same kind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯斯宾留下两个人看守小船，自己带领其他人到内陆去，但没走远，因为天太晚了，无法探测，而且天色很快就暗了。不过也用不着走远去探险。滩头处那一片平地既看不见道路，也看不见足迹，更看不见任何人烟。脚下到处都点缀着细软湿润的草皮，还有一种低矮的丛生植物，爱德蒙和露茜认为是石南。尤斯塔斯对植物学的确相当精通，他说不是石南，大概说对了；不过这东西多少跟石南一类大同小异。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I think it's a ruin," said Lucy when they had got a good deal nearer, and her guess was the best so far. What they now saw was a wide oblong space flagged with smooth stones and surrounded by grey pillars but unroofed. And from end to end of it ran a long table laid with a rich crimson cloth that came down nearly to the pavement. At either side of it were many chairs of stone richly carved and with silken cushions upon the seats. But on the table itself there was set out such a banquet as had never been seen, not even when Peter the High King kept his court at Cair Paravel. There were turkeys and geese and peacocks, there were boars' heads and sides of venison, there were pies shaped like ships under full sail or like dragons and elephants, there were ice puddings and bright lobsters and gleaming salmon, there were nuts and grapes, pineapples and peaches, pomegranates and melons and tomatoes. There were flagons of gold and silver and curiouslywrought glass; and the smell of the fruit and the wine blew towards them like a promise of all happiness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我想是座废墟吧。”他们走得更近时，露茜说，她的猜测到目前为止可以说是最正确的了。他们眼前看到的是一个宽阔的长方形空地，地面铺着光滑的石块，四下都是灰色的柱子，不过没有屋顶。从这一端到那一端有一张长长的桌子，桌上铺着大红桌布，几乎拖到石板地上。桌子两边有许多精工细雕的石椅，座位上铺着绸缎垫子。而且上面还摆了一桌从未见过的丰盛宴席，连至尊王彼得在凯尔帕拉维尔执政时也未见过这么丰盛的宴席。席上有火鸡、鹅和孔雀，有野猪头、鹿脯，有馅饼，有的形状像满帆的大船，有的像巨龙，有的像大象，有冰镇布丁，有鲜艳的龙虾、闪亮的鲑鱼，有果仁、葡萄、菠萝，有桃子、石榴、蜜瓜和番茄。还有金酒壶、银酒壶、制作奇巧的玻璃酒杯；水果和美酒的香味向他们迎面扑来，像有喜庆活动。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Everyone now came close and saw that what sat in those three chairs was three men, though hard to recognize as men till you looked closely. Their hair, which was grey, had grown over their eyes till it almost concealed their, faces, and their beards had grown over the table, climbing pound and entwining plates and goblets as brambles; entwine a fence, until, all mixed in one great mat of hair, they flowed over the edge and down to the floor. And from their heads the hair hung over the backs of their chairs so that they were wholly hidden. In fact the three men were; nearly all hair.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时大家走近一看，只见那三个座位上坐着的原来是三个人，可是不凑近看就看不出是人。他们的头发都已灰白，长得盖过眼睛，几乎遮住了脸，他们的胡子长得盖住桌子，沿着桌子攀缘，像荆棘盘绕篱笆似的盘绕着杯盘，缠到后来成了一大簇毛，飘拂过桌沿，拖到地面。他们头上的发丝还披散到椅背上，把身子全遮住了。实际上这三个人几乎浑身是毛发。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“瞧！”爱德蒙厉声说。眼下他们已走在柱子之间，站在石板地上了。大家都朝爱德蒙所指的地方看去。原来椅子不全是空座。在桌子首席和左右两边座位上有什么东西——可能有三个。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“死了吗？”凯斯宾说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We can try," said Caspian, and began shaking the nearest of the three sleepers. For a moment everyone thought he was going to be successful, for the man breathed hard and muttered, "I'll go eastward no more. Out oars for Narnia." But he sank back almost at once into a yet deeper sleep than before: that is, his heavy head sagged a few inches lower towards the table and all efforts to rouse him again were useless. With the second it was much the same. "Weren't born to live like animals. Get to the east while you've a chance -- lands behind the sun," and sank down. And the third only said, "Mustard, please," and slept hard.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们可以试试。”凯斯宾说，一面开始摇醒三个沉睡的人中最靠近他的一个。有一会儿大家以为他就要成功了，因为那人拼命吸着气，咕哝道：“我再也不往东去了，准备划船到纳尼亚去。”可是说完几乎一下子又陷入沉睡，而且睡得比先前还要沉；就是说，他那个沉沉的脑袋朝桌子冲下几英寸，任你怎么想方设法把他吵醒都没用。第二个人也差不多一样。“我们不是生来就得过牛马生活的。趁你有个机会快到东方去吧——到太阳后面的陆地上去。”说着就不省人事了。第三个人只说了一句：“请递给我芥末。”说完呼呼大睡。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They took some time choosing their seats at the perilous table. Probably everyone had the same reason but no one said it out loud. For it was really a rather nasty choice. One could hardly bear to sit all night next to those three terrible hairy objects which, if not dead, were certainly not alive in the ordinary sense. On the other hand, to sit at the far end, so that you would see them less and less as the night grew darker, and wouldn't know if they were moving, and perhaps wouldn't see them at all by about two o'clock no, it was not to be thought of. So they sauntered round and round the table saying, "What about here?" and "Or perhaps a bit further on," or, "Why not on this side?" till at last they settled down somewhere about the middle but nearer to the sleepers than to the other end. It was about ten by now and almost dark. Those strange new constellations burned in the east. Lucy would have liked it better if they had been the Leopard and the Ship and other old friends of the Narnian sky.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们花了老半天工夫才在这张危机四伏的桌上挑好座位，恐怕每个人都出于同样的原因，但是没人说出口而已。因为这的确是件相当讨厌的选择。要你整夜坐在三个浑身长着吓人长毛的怪物旁边，可不大受得了，这三个即使不是死人，按常理来说，确实也不是活人。但另一方面呢，坐在那一头，天色越来越黑，就越是看不见他们，不会知道他们是不是有动静，也许到半夜两点钟光景就一点也看不见他们了——不，不该想这事。于是他们就绕着桌子走了一圈又一圈，嘴里一面说：“这儿怎么样？”一会儿说：“或许还是坐得远一点儿吧，”一会儿又说：“为什么不坐在这一边呢？”到末了终于决定坐在中间，不过离三个沉睡的人比离另一头更近些。这时大约十点钟，天几乎黑了。那些陌生的新星座在东方发光。如果这是豹子星座和船星座，以及纳尼亚上空看到过的星座老朋友，露茜会更喜欢。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="过了几个小时，倒仿佛过了好几个世纪似的，有一阵子他们都明白刚才已经打过一会儿盹，突然一下子又全都清醒了。那些星座的方向都跟刚才看见的大不相同了。天空很黑，只有东方隐隐约约有点灰白。他们虽然口渴，而且身上又冷又僵，却没一个人开口说话，因为终于出现了奇事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Before them, beyond the pillars, there was the slope of a low hill. And now a door opened in the hillside, and light appeared in the doorway, and a figure came out, and the door shut behind it. The figure carried a light, and this light was really all that they could see distinctly. It came slowly nearer and nearer till at last it stood right at the table opposite to them. Now they could see that it was a tall girl, dressed in a single long garment of clear blue which left her arms bare. She was bareheaded and her yellow hair hung down her back. And when they looked at her they thought they had never before known what beauty meant.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在他们前面，柱子外有座低矮的小山的斜坡。这时坡上有扇门打开了，门口露出了亮光，一个人走了出来，背后的门又关上了。那人手里拿着灯火，这灯火其实就是他们惟一能看得清的东西。灯火慢慢越来越近，越来越近，最后就正好对着他们，放在桌子对面。他们这才看见来人是个高个儿姑娘，身穿一件蓝色露臂长袍。她没戴帽子，一头金发披散在背后。他们瞧着她的时候心里就想，活到这么大才知道什么叫美人儿呢。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The light which she had been carrying was a tall candle in a silver candlestick which she now set upon the table. If there had been any wind off the sea earlier in the night it must have died down by now, for the flame of the candle burned as straight and still as if it were in a room with the windows shut and the curtains drawn. Gold and silver on the table shone in its light.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Seven years ago," said the girl, "they came here in a ship whose sails were rags and timbers ready to fall apart. There were a few others with them, sailors, and when they came to this table one said, `Here is the good place. Let us set sail and reef sail and row no longer but sit down and end our days in peace!' And the second said, `No, let us re-embark and sail for Narnia and the west; it may be that Miraz is dead.' But the third, who was a very masterful man, leaped up and said, `No, by heaven. We are men and Telmarines, not brutes. What should we do but seek adventure after adventure? We have not long to live in any event. Let us spend what is left in seeking the unpeopled world behind the sunrise.' And as they quarrelled he caught up the Knife of Stone which lies there on the table and would have fought with his comrades. But it is a thing not right for him to touch. And as his fingers closed upon the hilt, deep sleep fell upon all the three. And till the enchantment is undone they will never wake."</div>
