<div class="line_en">Alone once more in the sordid parlour of the dead missionary, lying on the long chair that faced the window, her abstracted eyes on the temple across the river (now again at the approach of evening aerial and lovely), Kitty tried to set in order the feelings in her heart. She would never have believed that this visit to the convent could so have moved her. She had gone from curiosity. She had nothing else to do and after looking for so many days at the walled city across the water she was not unwilling to have at least a glimpse of its mysterious streets.</div>

<div class="line_en">But once within the convent it had seemed to her that she was transported into another world situated strangely neither in space nor time. Those bare rooms and the white corridors, austere and simple, seemed to possess the spirit of something remote and mystical. The little chapel, so ugly and vulgar, in its very crudeness was pathetic; it had something which was wanting in the greatness of a cathedral, with its stained glass and its pictures: it was very humble; and the faith which had adorned it, the affection which cherished it, had endued it with a delicate beauty of the soul. The methodical way in which the convent's work was carried on in the midst of the pestilence showed a coolness in the face of danger and a practical sense, almost ironical it was so matter of fact, which were deeply impressive. In Kitty's ears rang still the ghastly sounds she heard when for a moment Sister St Joseph opened the infirmary door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是在修道院里的时候，有一会儿她感觉自己像是进入了另外一个世界，一个超然于宇宙之外的世界。那些空荡荡的房间和白色的走廊虽然简陋，却似乎有一种迷离、神秘的气息游荡于其间。那间小礼拜堂看上去是那么粗陋俗气，几乎可以说是一派惨相，然而它却具有某种雄伟的大教堂所没有的东西。它的彩窗和油画是如此拙劣，然而它所包含的信念，人们对它所怀有的崇高情感，却赋予了它纯净的灵魂之美。在这个瘟疫肆虐的中心地带，修道院的工作却是如此一丝不苟，有条不紊，简直就是对这场劫难的嘲讽。凯蒂的耳际又响起了圣约瑟姐妹打开医疗室的门时，那一片鬼哭狼嚎的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was unexpected the way they had spoken of Walter. First the Sister and then the Mother Superior herself, and the tone of her voice had been very gentle when she praised him. Oddly enough it gave her a little thrill of pride to know that they thought so well of him. Waddington also had told something of what Walter was doing; but it was not only his competence that the nuns praised (in Hong Kong she had known that he was thought clever), they spoke of his thoughtfulness and his tenderness. Of course he could be very tender. He was at his best when you were ill; he was too intelligent to exasperate, and his touch was pleasant, cool, and soothing. By some magic he seemed able by his mere presence to relieve your suffering. She knew that she would never see again in his eyes the look of affection which she had once been so used to that she found it merely exasperating. She knew now how immense was his capacity for loving; in some odd way he was pouring it out on these wretched sick who had only him to look to. She did not feel jealousy, but a sense of emptiness; it was as though a support that she had grown so accustomed to as not to realize its presence were suddenly withdrawn from her so that she swayed this way and that like a thing that was top-heavy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她们评论瓦尔特的话也出乎她的意料。先是圣约瑟姐妹，然后是修道院长自己，她们的声调一到了赞扬他的时候就变得异常欣慰。她们夸奖他时，她竟然会见鬼地感到一阵骄傲。韦丁顿也提到过瓦尔特做的事，但只是称赞他的医术和头脑（在香港就有人说他脑瓜聪明了），这点修女们也肯定过了。然而她们还说他这个人体贴细心，温柔和善。他当然可能非常和善，要是有人病了，那正是他显露身手的时候；他聪明的脑瓜自然知道怎么不弄疼你，上手一定又轻又柔。这个人一出场就让你病痛全无，你不夸他妙手回春才怪呢。现在她明白他的眼里再也看不到那种百般怜爱的神情了，以前她终日与这种神情相伴，只有觉得厌烦。如今她知道他还很会爱别人，并且正在用一种古怪的方式将这种爱倾注到那些把性命交给他的病人身上。她没有感到嫉妒，只是有点惘然若失，就好像她长久以来习惯靠于其上的扶手突然被抽走了，使她一下子头重脚轻，左摇右晃。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Waddington too thought highly of Walter. She alone had been blind to his merit. Why? Because he loved her and she did not love him. What was it in the human heart that made you despise a man because he loved you? But Waddington had confessed that he did not like Walter. Men didn't. It was easy to see that those two nuns had for him a feeling which was very like affection. He was different with women; notwithstanding his shyness you felt in him an exquisite kindliness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="韦丁顿也对瓦尔特评价颇高。唯独她对他的价值视而不见，为什么？因为他爱了她，而她却不爱他。一个男人由于爱你而遭到你的鄙视，这人心是怎么长的啊？不过，韦丁顿也承认他不是那么喜欢瓦尔特。看来男人都不喜欢他。可那两位嬷嬷对他的好感是挂在脸上的。看来女人对他另有一番感觉。她们敏锐地感觉到他的腼腆背后隐藏着一颗厚道和善的心。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She had only contempt for herself because once she had felt contempt for Walter. He must have known how she regarded him and he had accepted her estimate without bitterness. She was a fool and he knew it and because he loved her it had made no difference to him. She did not hate him now, nor feel resentment of him, but fear rather and perplexity. She could not but admit that he had remarkable qualities, sometimes she thought that there was even in him a strange and unattractive greatness; it was curious then that she could not love him, but loved still a man whose worthlessness was now so clear to her. After thinking, thinking, all through those long days she rated accurately Charles Townsend's value; he was a common fellow and his qualities were second-rate. If she could only tear from her heart the love that still lingered there! She tried not to think of him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="回忆起她曾经那么鄙视瓦尔特，现在她只想鄙视自己。她当初怎么看他的，他一定心知肚明，但他一如既往、毫无怨言地爱她。她是个笨蛋，他再清楚不过了；因为他爱她，这一点他也毫不在乎。现在她不再恨他了，也不憎恶，有的只是害怕和困惑。她不得不承认他的身上有出众的优点，甚至有那么一点不易被人察觉的伟大之处。而她竟然不爱他，却爱了一个她现在觉得不值一物的男人，这真是怪事。这些漫长的白天她一直思前想后，查理·唐生究竟哪里值得她爱呢？他只不过是个凡夫俗子，彻头彻尾的二流货色。如果她现在还是成天哭天抹泪，那岂不证明她的心思还留在他那儿？她必须忘了他。">查看中文翻译</div>
