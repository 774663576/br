<div class="line_en">He never spent the night with the others. It was easy enough if he was at their place: he could leave whenever he pleased. It was worse when they were at his and he had to explain that come midnight he would have to drive them home because he was an insomniac and found it impossible to fall asleep in close proximity to another person. Though it was not far from the truth, he never dared tell them the whole truth: after making love he had an uncontrollable craving to be by himself; waking in the middle of the night at the side of an alien body was distasteful to him, rising in the morning with an intruder repellent; he had no desire to be overheard brushing his teeth in the bathroom, nor was he enticed by the thought of an intimate breakfast.</div>

<div class="line_en">The unwritten contract of erotic friendship stipulated that Tomas should exclude all love from his life. The moment he violated that clause of the contract, his other mistresses would assume inferior status and become ripe for insurrection.</div>

<div class="line_en">Accordingly, he rented a room for Tereza and her heavy suitcase. He wanted to be able to watch over her, protect her, enjoy her presence, but felt no need to change his way of life.

<div class="line_en">From that time on they both looked forward to sleeping together. I might even say that the goal of their lovemaking was not so much pleasure as the sleep that followed it. She especially was affected. Whenever she stayed overnight in her rented room (which quickly became only an alibi for Tomas), she was unable to fall asleep; in his arms she would fall asleep no matter how wrought up she might have been. He would whisper impromptu fairy tales about her, or gibberish, words he repeated monotonously, words soothing or comical, which turned into vague visions lulling her through the first dreams of the night. He had complete control over her sleep: she dozed off at the second he chose.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从那以后，两人都乐滋滋盼着共同入眠。我甚至想说，他们做爱的目的并不是追求快感，而是为了之后的共枕而眠。尤其是她，没有他就睡不着觉。如果得一个人呆在单室套（它越来越成为一个托词），她整夜都闭不了眼睛。在他怀中，无论有多兴奋，她都能慢慢入睡。他为她编故事，轻声讲给她听，或者说一些无关紧要的事，声音单调，翻来覆去，但却有趣，给人抚慰。在特蕾莎的脑海中，这些话渐渐化作朦胧的幻影，带她入梦。他完全控制了她的睡眠，要她哪一刻入睡，她就在哪一刻入眠。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">While they slept, she held him as on the first night, keeping a firm grip on wrist, finger, or ankle. If he wanted to move without waking her, he had to resort to artifice. After freeing his finger (wrist, ankle) from her clutches, a process which, since she guarded him carefully even in her sleep, never failed to rouse her partially, he would calm her by slipping an object into her hand (a rolled-up pajama top, a slipper, a book), which she then gripped as tightly as if it were a part of his body.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="睡着时，她还像第一夜那样攥着他：紧紧地抓住他的手腕、手指或脚踝。当他想离开又不弄醒她，他就得使点花招。他从她手中抽出手指（手腕或脚踝），这总会让她在模糊中惊醒过来，因为睡着的时候她也很用心地守着他。为了让她安静，他就塞一件东西到她手中（一件揉成一团的睡衣，一只拖鞋，一本书），而她随后紧紧地攥着它，好像那是他身体的一部分。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That is why he was so surprised to wake up and find Tereza squeezing his hand tightly. Lying there looking at her, he could not quite understand what had happened. But as he ran through the previous few hours in his mind, he began to sense an aura of hitherto unknown happiness emanating from them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这就是为什么他醒后发现特蕾莎紧紧地攥着他的手时会如此惊讶！他看着她，难以明白到底发生了什么事。他回想起刚刚逝去的几个小时的时光，以为从中呼吸到了莫名的幸福的芬芳。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Once, when he had just lulled her to sleep but she had gone no farther than dream's antechamber and was therefore still responsive to him, he said to her, Good-bye, I'm going now. Where? she asked in her sleep. Away, he answered sternly. Then I'm going with you, she said, sitting up in bed. No, you can't. I'm going away for good, he said, going out into the hall. She stood up and followed him out, squinting. She was naked beneath her short nightdress. Her face was blank, expressionless, but she moved energetically. He walked through the hall of the flat into the hall of the building (the hall shared by all the occupants), closing the door in her face. She flung it open and continued to follow him, convinced in her sleep that he meant to leave her for good and she had to stop him. He walked down the stairs to the first landing and waited for her there. She went down after him, took him by the hand, and led him back to bed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天，他刚哄她入睡，但她还没有进入梦乡，还能回答提问。他对她说：“好了！现在我要走了。”“哪儿？”她问。“我要出门。”他认真地说。“我要和你一起去。”她边说边从床上坐了起来。“不，我不要。我这一走就不回来了。”他说着走出了房间，到了门口。她起身跟他到了门口，眨着眼睛。她只穿了一件短睡裙，下面什么也没穿。她的脸麻木，没有表情，但她的动作很有力。他从门口走到走廊上（是楼房的公共走廊），当着她的面关上门。她猛地打开门，跟着他，在半睡眠中确信他想永远地离开她，而她应该留住他。他下了一层楼，站在楼梯口等着她。她在那儿找到他，抓住他的手，拉他回到自己身边，回到床上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tomas came to this conclusion: Making love with a woman and sleeping with a woman are two separate passions, not merely different but opposite. Love does not make itself felt in the desire for copulation (a desire that extends to an infinite number of women) but in the desire for shared sleep (a desire limited to one woman).</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="托马斯心想：跟一个女人做爱和跟一个女人睡觉，是两种截然不同，甚至几乎对立的感情。爱情并不是通过做爱的欲望（这可以是对无数女人的欲求）体现的，而是通过和她共眠的欲望（这只能是对一个女人的欲求）而体现出来的。">查看中文翻译</div>
