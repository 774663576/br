<div class="line_en">The hall of the house was cool as a vault. Mrs. Dalloway raised her hand to her eyes, and, as the maid shut the door to, and she heard the swish of Lucy's skirts, she felt like a nun who has left the world and feels fold round her the familiar veils and the response to old devotions. The cook whistled in the kitchen. She heard the click of the typewriter. It was her life, and, bending her head over the hall table, she bowed beneath the influence, felt blessed and purified, saying to herself, as she took the pad with the telephone message on it, how moments like this are buds on the tree of life, flowers of darkness they are, she thought (as if some lovely rose had blossomed for her eyes only); not for a moment did she believe in God; but all the more, she thought, taking up the pad, must one repay in daily life to servants, yes, to dogs and canaries, above all to Richard her husband, who was the foundation of it -- of the gay sounds, of the green lights, of the cook even whistling, for Mrs. Walker was Irish and whistled all day long -- one must pay back from this secret deposit of exquisite moments, she thought, lifting the pad, while Lucy stood by her, trying to explain how</div>

<div class="line_en">Millicent Bruton, whose lunch parties were said to be extraordinarily amusing, had not asked her. No vulgar jealousy could separate her from Richard. But she feared time itself, and read on Lady Bruton's face, as if it had been a dial cut in impassive stone, the dwindling of life; how year by year her share was sliced; how little the margin that remained was capable any longer of stretching, of absorbing, as in the youthful years, the colours, salts, tones of existence, so that she filled the room she entered, and felt often as she stood hesitating one moment on the threshold of her drawing- room, an exquisite suspense, such as might stay a diver before plunging while the sea darkens and brightens beneath him, and the waves which threaten to break, but only gently split their surface, roll and conceal and encrust as they just turn over the weeds with pearl.</div>

<div class="line_en">Like a nun withdrawing, or a child exploring a tower, she went upstairs, paused at the window, came to the bathroom. There was the green linoleum and a tap dripping. There was an emptiness about the heart of life; an attic room. Women must put off their rich apparel. At midday they must disrobe. She pierced the pincushion and laid her feathered yellow hat on the bed. The sheets were clean, tight stretched in a broad white band from side to side. Narrower and narrower would her bed be. The candle was half burnt down and she had read deep in Baron Marbot's Memoirs. She had read late at night of the retreat from Moscow. For the House sat so long that Richard insisted, after her illness, that she must sleep undisturbed. And really she preferred to read of the retreat from Moscow. He knew it. So the room was an attic; the bed narrow; and lying there reading, for she slept badly, she could not dispel a virginity preserved through childbirth which clung to her like a sheet. Lovely in girlhood, suddenly there came a moment -- for example on the river beneath the woods at Clieveden -- when, through some contraction of this cold spirit, she had failed him. And then at Constantinople, and again and again. She could see what she lacked. It was not beauty; it was not mind. It was something central which permeated; something warm which broke up surfaces and rippled the cold contact of man and woman, or of women together. For THAT she could dimly perceive. She resented it, had a scruple picked up Heaven knows where, or, as she felt, sent by Nature (who is invariably wise); yet she could not resist sometimes yielding to the charm of a woman, not a girl, of a woman confessing, as to her they often did, some scrape, some folly. And whether it was pity, or their beauty, or that she was older, or some accident -- like a faint scent, or a violin next door (so strange is the power of sounds at certain moments), she did undoubtedly then feel what men felt. Only for a moment; but it was enough. It was a sudden revelation, a tinge like a blush which one tried to check and then, as it spread, one yielded to its expansion, and rushed to the farthest verge and there quivered and felt the world come closer, swollen with some astonishing significance, some pressure of rapture, which split its thin skin and gushed and poured with an extraordinary alleviation over the cracks and sores! Then, for that moment, she had seen an illumination; a match burning in a crocus; an inner meaning almost expressed. But the close withdrew; the hard softened. It was over -- the moment. Against such moments (with women too) there contrasted (as she laid her hat down) the bed and Baron Marbot and the candle half-burnt. Lying awake, the floor creaked; the lit house was suddenly darkened, and if she raised her head she could just hear the click of the handle released as gently as possible by Richard, who slipped upstairs in his socks and then, as often as not, dropped his hot-water bottle and swore! How she laughed!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="像个引身而退的修女，又像是个在宝塔上探险的孩子，她走上楼去，在窗前停留片刻，然后走进了卫生间。地上铺着绿地毡，有一只龙头在滴水。生活的核心是一片空虚，是阁楼上的一个房间。女人必须脱下她们那华贵的衣饰。到了正午时分，她们就必须脱下睡袍。她把发针插到针垫上，将她那饰有羽毛的黄帽子放在床上。床单很干净，床角处的白色阔条纹镶边绷得笔挺。她的床会越变越窄。蜡烛已烧掉了一半，她曾躺在床上入迷地读过马尔博男爵的《回忆录》[22]。她曾在深夜里读着关于莫斯科大撤退的描述。因为议会的会议总是开到很晚，理查德考虑到她的病体，坚持说她的睡眠不应该受到干扰。而其实，她更愿意在夜里看讲述莫斯科大撤退的书。他知道的。于是她的卧室被安排在阁楼上，一张窄窄的床。躺在那里看书，因为她的睡眠质量不好，她无法驱散那种生完孩子后还依然保留着的处女感，那感觉如床单般包裹着她。少女时代的她很可爱，可突然也会出现那样的时刻——比如那次在克里弗登树林下的河上——当时，由于这种冷漠的性情突然来袭，她让他失望了。接下来的一次发生在康斯坦丁堡，再后来发作的次数就越来越多了。她明白自己的缺陷在哪里。不是美貌，不是心灵。是某种渗透她全身的本质的东西，是一股冲破了表层的暖流，使男女间或女性间的冷漠关系激起了涟漪。她能够隐约地感触到这一点。她憎恨它，天知道这样的踌躇不安是从哪里得来的，她感到，或许是天性使然（她的天性向来都很明智）。然而她有时也会禁不住被女性的魅力征服，那魅力不是来自少女，而是来自于坦然相告的女人，她们常常对她倾诉，倾诉她们的困厄，她们的愚笨。不管是出于同情，还是被她们的美貌吸引，还是由于自己比她们年长，还是某种偶然的因素——如一阵淡淡的清香，或隔壁飘来的小提琴声（在某些时刻，音乐的力量是那么不可思议），她当时毫无疑问地体会到了男人们的感觉。这样的感觉虽然只在一时，但已足够。这是不期而至的启示，如脸上泛起的一阵红晕，你想要加以遏制，然而它已扩散开，你拿它束手无策，只得赶紧躲到偏僻的角落里，在那里暗自颤抖，感觉这个世界在向你逼近，这个世界因为某种奇异的意义、某种狂喜的压力而不断膨胀，挣破了稀薄的表皮喷涌而出，用超凡的抚慰能力，缝合了裂缝与剧痛！然后，就在那一刻，她看见了一幕幻景，在一朵藏红花中燃烧着的一根火柴，一种内在的意义几乎就要显露出来。可是，靠近中的世界撤退了，那份坚强也随之疲软了下去。结束了——这个时刻到此为止了。同这样的时刻（也包括同女人们在一起的时刻）形成对比（她放下了帽子）的是，这张床、这本马尔博男爵的书、这根烧得剩下半支的蜡烛。睁着眼睛躺在床上，地板在嘎吱作响。灯火通明的屋子突然间暗下来，如果她抬起头来，就能听见理查德小心翼翼地轻轻转动门把手时发出的咔哒声。接着，他脱掉鞋子悄悄地溜上楼，有时还会失手把热水袋掉在地上，随即就是一通咒骂！那时她会笑得合不拢嘴！【注：[22]马尔博男爵（1782~1854），法国将军，著有描写拿破仑时代的《回忆录》。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She put the pad on the hall table. She began to go slowly upstairs, with her hand on the bannisters, as if she had left a party, where now this friend now that had flashed back her face, her voice; had shut the door and gone out and stood alone, a single figure against the appalling night, or rather, to be accurate, against the stare of this matter-of-fact June morning; soft with the glow of rose petals for some, she knew, and felt it, as she paused by the open staircase window which let in blinds flapping, dogs barking, let in, she thought, feeling herself suddenly shrivelled, aged, breastless, the grinding, blowing, flowering of the day, out of doors, out of the window, out of her body and brain which now failed, since Lady Bruton, whose lunch parties were said to be extraordinarily amusing, had not asked her.</div>

<div class="line_en">She sat on the floor -- that was her first impression of Sally -- she sat on the floor with her arms round her knees, smoking a cigarette. Where could it have been? The Mannings? The Kinloch- Jones's? At some party (where, she could not be certain), for she had a distinct recollection of saying to the man she was with, "Who is THAT?" And he had told her, and said that Sally's parents did not get on (how that shocked her -- that one's parents should quarrel!). But all that evening she could not take her eyes off Sally. It was an extraordinary beauty of the kind she most admired, dark, large-eyed, with that quality which, since she hadn't got it herself, she always envied -- a sort of abandonment, as if she could say anything, do anything; a quality much commoner in foreigners than in Englishwomen. Sally always said she had French blood in her veins, an ancestor had been with Marie Antoinette, had his head cut off, left a ruby ring. Perhaps that summer she came to stay at Bourton, walking in quite unexpectedly without a penny in her pocket, one night after dinner, and upsetting poor Aunt Helena to such an extent that she never forgave her. There had been some quarrel at home. She literally hadn't a penny that night when she came to them -- had pawned a brooch to come down. She had rushed off in a passion. They sat up till all hours of the night talking. Sally it was who made her feel, for the first time, how sheltered the life at Bourton was. She knew nothing about sex -- nothing about social problems. She had once seen an old man who had dropped dead in a field -- she had seen cows just after their calves were born. But Aunt Helena never liked discussion of anything (when Sally gave her William Morris, it had to be wrapped in brown paper). There they sat, hour after hour, talking in her bedroom at the top of the house, talking about life, how they were to reform the world. They meant to found a society to abolish private property, and actually had a letter written, though not sent out. The ideas were Sally's, of course -- but very soon she was just as excited -- read Plato in bed before breakfast; read Morris; read Shelley by the hour.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="坐在地板上——那是萨利给她的第一印象——双手抱膝坐在地板上，抽着烟。会是发生在哪儿呢？在曼宁家吗？在金洛克·琼斯家吗？一定是在某次派对上（在哪里的派对呢，她记不得了），因为她清楚地记得，她问过那个当时陪着萨利本人的男子：“那人是谁呀？”，那男子也告诉了她，还说萨利的父母关系不和（她当时多么诧异——为人父母的竟然也会干架）。不过，她的视线整晚都不曾离开过萨利。那是她最为爱慕的超凡脱俗的美，黝黑的肤色，大大的眼睛，她总是羡慕那种气质，因为她自己身上没有——那种放纵的气质，就好像什么都能说，什么都能做。这样的气质在外国人身上很常见，但在英国女人身上却很稀罕。萨利总是说她血管里流着法国人的血，她有一个祖先曾经侍奉过玛丽·安托瓦内特[23]，后来被砍了头，留下了一枚红宝石戒指。也许就在那年夏天，萨利来伯尔顿小住，有天晚饭后，她突然风风火火地闯进来，身上分文没有，着实把可怜的海伦娜姑妈搞得火冒三丈，以至于从此再也没有原谅她。原来是她家发生了一场争吵。于是那天晚上她就跑到克拉丽莎家来了，身上真的是一文没有——连路费都是当掉了一枚胸针换来的。她是在一怒之下离家出走的。那天晚上，她们整整聊了一个通宵。正是萨利使克拉丽莎头一次感悟到，伯尔顿的生活是多么闭塞。她对性一无所知——对社会问题也一窍不通。她有次看见一个老头摔死在农田里——也看见过刚产下小牛犊的母牛。可是，海伦娜姑妈从不喜欢谈论任何事情（萨利把威廉·莫里斯[24]的书借给她时，还不得不用牛皮纸把封面包起来）。她们俩坐在顶楼上她的闺房里，一谈就是好几个钟头，她们谈论生活，谈论该如何去改造这个世界。她们想要建立一个废除私有制的社会，还确实写过一封关于这个想法的信，尽管没有寄出去。当然，这主意最初是萨利想出来的——不过，不多会儿她就和萨利一样兴奋起来——在早餐前还躺在床上读柏拉图，读莫里斯，甚至连着个把小时读雪莱的诗歌呢。【注：[23]玛丽·安托瓦内特（1755~1793）：法王路易十六之妻，一代艳后。在法国大革命期间被送上断头台。[24]威廉·莫里斯（1834~1896）：英国作家、画家，代表作有《世俗的天堂》《乌有乡的消息》等。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The strange thing, on looking back, was the purity, the integrity, of her feeling for Sally. It was not like one's feeling for a man. It was completely disinterested, and besides, it had a quality which could only exist between women, between women just grown up. It was protective, on her side; sprang from a sense of being in league together, a presentiment of something that was bound to part them (they spoke of marriage always as a catastrophe), which led to this chivalry, this protective feeling which was much more on her side than Sally's. For in those days she was completely reckless; did the most idiotic things out of bravado; bicycled round the parapet on the terrace; smoked cigars. Absurd, she was -- very absurd. But the charm was overpowering, to her at least, so that she could remember standing in her bedroom at the top of the house holding the hot-water can in her hands and saying aloud, "She is beneath this roof… She is beneath this roof!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="回想起来，令人诧异的是，她对萨利的感情既纯洁又诚恳。这和她对男人的感情迥然不同。这种感情完全是无私的，而且，还有一种只存在于女性间的，尤其是刚成年的女性间的特质。在她这边，这感情是保护性的。它发自一种类似于同盟军般的感觉，一种终将有什么会来拆散她们的预感（她们谈起婚姻来，总说得像是一场灾祸），导致了这种骑士精神，这种想要保护对方的感情，这样的感情在她身上要比萨利强烈许多。因为在那些日子里，萨利无论做什么都全然不计后果。出于虚荣心，萨利会干下最出格的事，围着露台的女儿墙骑自行车，抽雪茄烟。荒唐，那时的她——实在是荒唐。可是，她的魅力也是毋庸置疑的，至少对克拉丽莎来说是的。所以她至今还记得自己手里拿着热水罐，站在位于顶楼的闺房里，大声地喃喃自语：“她和我在同一屋檐下…她和我在同一屋檐下啊！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sally's power was amazing, her gift, her personality. There was her way with flowers, for instance. At Bourton they always had stiff little vases all the way down the table. Sally went out, picked hollyhocks, dahlias -- all sorts of flowers that had never been seen together -- cut their heads off, and made them swim on the top of water in bowls. The effect was extraordinary -- coming in to dinner in the sunset. (Of course Aunt Helena thought it wicked to treat flowers like that.) Then she forgot her sponge, and ran along the passage naked. That grim old housemaid, Ellen Atkins, went about grumbling --"Suppose any of the gentlemen had seen?" Indeed she did shock people. She was untidy, Papa said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="萨利的力量是惊人的，她有天赋，有个性。比如，她对待鲜花的方式就很独特。在伯尔顿，人们总是在桌子底下摆一整排难看的小花瓶。萨利跑出去，采来了蜀葵、大丽花——各种鲜花，人们从未看见过这些花被摆在一起的——剪下花朵，放在一只只水杯里，让它们漂浮在水面上。人们在日落时分进来用餐时，都会为那别致的效果而惊叹不已（当然，海伦娜姑妈认为那样对待鲜花实在是缺德）。还有次，她洗澡忘了拿海绵，就光着身子跑过走廊去取。从此，那个一本正经的老女佣艾伦·阿特金斯逢人就嘀嘀咕咕——“要是给哪位先生看见了该怎么得了？”她的行为着实令人咋舌。克拉丽莎的父亲则嫌她不修边幅。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She was wearing pink gauze -- was that possible? She SEEMED, anyhow, all light, glowing, like some bird or air ball that has flown in, attached itself for a moment to a bramble. But nothing is so strange when one is in love (and what was this except being in love?) as the complete indifference of other people. Aunt Helena just wandered off after dinner; Papa read the paper. Peter Walsh might have been there, and old Miss Cummings; Joseph Breitkopf certainly was, for he came every summer, poor old man, for weeks and weeks, and pretended to read German with her, but really played the piano and sang Brahms without any voice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="萨利穿了件粉红的薄纱衫——怎么可能？总之，她看上去，光彩熠熠，生气勃勃，就像飞进来的一只小鸟或气球，暂时歇息在一根荆棘上。但在一个人恋爱时（如果这不算爱，那算什么呢），最难理解的莫过于他人的全然漠视。海伦娜姑妈一吃完晚饭就走开了，爸爸在看报纸。彼德·沃尔什也许当时在场，也许还有老小姐卡明斯。约瑟夫·布莱科普夫一定也在场，因为他每年夏天都来，可怜的老头，一住就是好几个礼拜，表面上是来和她一起读德语的，但其实是来弹钢琴，是来荒腔走调地演唱勃拉姆斯的歌曲的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">No, the words meant absolutely nothing to her now. She could not even get an echo of her old emotion. But she could remember going cold with excitement, and doing her hair in a kind of ecstasy (now the old feeling began to come back to her, as she took out her hairpins, laid them on the dressing-table, began to do her hair), with the rooks flaunting up and down in the pink evening light, and dressing, and going downstairs, and feeling as she crossed the hall "if it were now to die 'twere now to be most happy." That was her feeling -- Othello's feeling, and she felt it, she was convinced, as strongly as Shakespeare meant Othello to feel it, all because she was coming down to dinner in a white frock to meet Sally Seton!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不，现在这些话对她来说已毫无意义了。往昔的感情，她甚至连一点余韵都捕捉不住。但她还能记得自己曾激动得浑身冰凉，在迷醉的状态下梳妆打扮（此刻，往日的感觉似乎又回来了，她拔下发针，放在梳妆台上，开始梳头）。在粉红的暮色中，有几只白嘴鸦飞上飞下，她穿戴好后走下楼去，穿过客厅时，她感到“如果此刻就能奔赴黄泉，那么此刻就是最幸福的时刻了”。那就是她的感觉——奥赛罗式的感觉，她感受到了，她相信自己的感受和莎士比亚笔下奥赛罗的感受一般强烈，这都是因为，她穿了一袭白衣走下楼去，要去和萨利·西顿一起吃顿晚饭呢！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">All this was only a background for Sally. She stood by the fireplace talking, in that beautiful voice which made everything she said sound like a caress, to Papa, who had begun to be attracted rather against his will (he never got over lending her one of his books and finding it soaked on the terrace), when suddenly she said, "What a shame to sit indoors!" and they all went out on to the terrace and walked up and down. Peter Walsh and Joseph Breitkopf went on about Wagner. She and Sally fell a little behind. Then came the most exquisite moment of her whole life passing a stone urn with flowers in it. Sally stopped; picked a flower; kissed her on the lips. The whole world might have turned upside down! The others disappeared; there she was alone with Sally. And she felt that she had been given a present, wrapped up, and told just to keep it, not to look at it -- a diamond, something infinitely precious, wrapped up, which, as they walked (up and down, up and down), she uncovered, or the radiance burnt through, the revelation, the religious feeling!-- when old Joseph and Peter faced them:</div>

Always when she thought of him she thought of their quarrels for some reason -- because she wanted his good opinion so much, perhaps. She owed him words: "sentimental," "civilised"; they started up every day of her life as if he guarded her. A book was sentimental; an attitude to life sentimental. "Sentimental," perhaps she was to be thinking of the past. What would he think, she wondered, when he came back?</div>

She had just broken into her fifty-second year. Months and months of it were still untouched. June, July, August! Each still remained almost whole, and, as if to catch the falling drop, Clarissa (crossing to the dressing-table) plunged into the very heart of the moment, transfixed it, there -- the moment of this June morning on which was the pressure of all the other mornings, seeing the glass, the dressing-table, and all the bottles afresh, collecting the whole of her at one point (as she looked into the glass), seeing the delicate pink face of the woman who was that very night to give a party; of Clarissa Dalloway; of herself.</div>

That was her self when some effort, some call on her to be her self, drew the parts together, she alone knew how different, how incompatible and composed so for the world only into one centre, one diamond, one woman who sat in her drawing-room and made a meeting-point, a radiancy no doubt in some dull lives, a refuge for the lonely to come to, perhaps; she had helped young people, who were grateful to her; had tried to be the same always, never showing a sign of all the other sides of her -- faults, jealousies, vanities, suspicions, like this of Lady Bruton not asking her to lunch; which, she thought (combing her hair finally), is utterly base!

<div class="line_en">"Do you remember the lake?" she said, in an abrupt voice, under the pressure of an emotion which caught her heart, made the muscles of her throat stiff, and contracted her lips in a spasm as she said "lake." For she was a child, throwing bread to the ducks, between her parents, and at the same time a grown woman coming to her parents who stood by the lake, holding her life in her arms which, as she neared them, grew larger and larger in her arms, until it became a whole life, a complete life, which she put down by them and said, "This is what I have made of it! This!" And what had she made of it? What, indeed? sitting there sewing this morning with Peter.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes," said Peter. "Yes, yes, yes," he said, as if she drew up to the surface something which positively hurt him as it rose. Stop! Stop! he wanted to cry. For he was not old; his life was not over; not by any means. He was only just past fifty. Shall I tell her, he thought, or not? He would like to make a clean breast of it all. But she is too cold, he thought; sewing, with her scissors; Daisy would look ordinary beside Clarissa. And she would think me a failure, which I am in their sense, he thought; in the Dalloways' sense. Oh yes, he had no doubt about that; he was a failure, compared with all this -- the inlaid table, the mounted paper-knife, the dolphin and the candlesticks, the chair-covers and the old valuable English tinted prints -- he was a failure! I detest the smugness of the whole affair, he thought; Richard's doing, not Clarissa's; save that she married him. (Here Lucy came into the room, carrying silver, more silver, but charming, slender, graceful she looked, he thought, as she stooped to put it down.) And this has been going on all the time! he thought; week after week; Clarissa's life; while I -- he thought; and at once everything seemed to radiate from him; journeys; rides; quarrels; adventures; bridge parties; love affairs; work; work, work! and he took out his knife quite openly -- his old horn-handled knife which Clarissa could swear he had had these thirty years -- and clenched his fist upon it.</div>

So Peter Walsh and Clarissa, sitting side by side on the blue sofa, challenged each other. His powers chafed and tossed in him. He assembled from different quarters all sorts of things; praise; his career at Oxford; his marriage, which she knew nothing whatever about; how he had loved; and altogether done his job.</div>

<div class="line_en">What an extraordinary habit that was, Clarissa thought; always playing with a knife. Always making one feel, too, frivolous; empty-minded; a mere silly chatterbox, as he used.
