<div class="line_en">At the time I establish'd myself in Pennsylvania, there was not a good bookseller's shop in any of the colonies to the southward of Boston. In New York and Philad'a the printers were indeed stationers; they sold only paper, etc., almanacs, ballads, and a few common school-books. Those who lov'd reading were oblig'd to send for their books from England; the members of the Junto had each a few. We had left the alehouse, where we first met, and hired a room to hold our club in. I propos'd that we should all of us bring our books to that room, where they would not only be ready to consult in our conferences, but become a common benefit, each of us being at liberty to borrow such as he wish'd to read at home. This was accordingly done, and for some time contented us.</div>

<div class="line_en">Finding the advantage of this little collection, I propos'd to render the benefit from books more common, by commencing a public subscription library. I drew a sketch of the plan and rules that would be necessary, and got a skilful conveyancer, Mr. Charles Brockden, to put the whole in form of articles of agreement to be subscribed, by which each subscriber engag'd to pay a certain sum down for the first purchase of books, and an annual contribution for increasing them. So few were the readers at that time in Philadelphia, and the majority of us so poor, that I was not able, with great industry, to find more than fifty persons, mostly young tradesmen, willing to pay down for this purpose forty shillings each, and ten shillings per annum. On this little fund we began. The books were imported; the library wag opened one day in the week for lending to the subscribers, on their promissory notes to pay double the value if not duly returned. The institution soon manifested its utility, was imitated by other towns, and in other provinces. The libraries were augmented by donations; reading became fashionable; and our people, having no publick amusements to divert their attention from study, became better acquainted with books, and in a few years were observ'd by strangers to be better instructed and more intelligent than people of the same rank generally are in other countries.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="自传续编后来看到了这个小小藏书楼的优点，我就主张推广读书的利益，建立一个公共订阅图书馆。我起草了一个计划，拟订了一些必要的规程。请一个熟识业务的公证人，查理·勃劳克田先生，把全文写成了订阅合同条款，按照合同每一个订阅户同意为第一批购书先付一笔费用，以后每年付一定数目的会费来添置图书。在费城那时候读者是寥若晨星，我们又大多数很穷，我东奔西跑也只不过找到了五十个人，多半是年轻的手艺工人，愿意各人为此先付出四十先令，以后每人每年付十先令。我们就靠了这样微薄的资金开始了。书籍进口了，图书馆每周开放一天，向订阅户办理借阅手续，但是他们得签署凭证，同意假如书籍不能按时归还，就得照价加倍偿还。这种图书馆不久就显出了它的效用，其他州的城镇也起来仿效了。这些图书馆获得了私人捐款后也扩大了，读书成为一种风尚。因为我们的人民没有公共娱乐来转移他们对读书的兴趣，所以他们对书籍就比较熟悉。几年以后，照外国观察家的看法，他们的文化水平和他们的智力较之别的国家中同一阶级的一般人民有过之而无不及。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The objections and reluctances I met with in soliciting the subscriptions, made me soon feel the impropriety of presenting one's self as the proposer of any useful project, that might be suppos'd to raise one's reputation in the smallest degree above that of one's neighbors, when one has need of their assistance to accomplish that project. I therefore put myself as much as I could out of sight, and stated it as a scheme of a number of friends, who had requested me to go about and propose it to such as they thought lovers of reading. In this way my affair went on more smoothly, and I ever after practis'd it on such occasions; and, from my frequent successes, can heartily recommend it. The present little sacrifice of your vanity will afterwards be amply repaid. If it remains a while uncertain to whom the merit belongs, some one more vain than yourself will be encouraged to claim it, and then even envy will be disposed to do you justice by plucking those assumed feathers, and restoring them to their right owner.</div>

<div class="line_en">This library afforded me the means of improvement by constant study, for which I set apart an hour or two each day, and thus repair'd in some degree the loss of the learned education my father once intended for me. Reading was the only amusement I allow'd myself. I spent no time in taverns, games, or frolicks of any kind; and my industry in my business continu'd as indefatigable as it was necessary. I was indebted for my printing-house; I had a young family coming on to be educated, and I had to contend with for business two printers, who were established in the place before me. My circumstances, however, grew daily easier. My original habits of frugality continuing, and my father having, among his instructions to me when a boy, frequently repeated a proverb of Solomon, "Seest thou a man diligent in his calling, he shall stand before kings, he shall not stand before mean men," I from thence considered industry as a means of obtaining wealth and distinction, which encourag'd me, tho' I did not think that I should ever literally stand before kings, which, however, has since happened; for I have stood before five, and even had the honor of sitting down with one, the King of Denmark, to dinner.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个图书馆给我一个不断钻研提高自己的机会，我每日划出一两小时来读书，这样在某种程度上弥补了我没有受过高深教育的缺陷。我父亲曾经一度有意让我受这种高深广博的教育。除了读书以外，我不允许我自己有其他的娱乐。我从不到酒馆、赌场或任何其他娱乐场所去消磨辰光，我在我业务上继续勤勤恳恳辛辛苦苦地工作，这在当时是必要的。我为印刷铺负的债还未偿清。我家里的小孩快要受教育了，在业务上我还得跟两家在我以前就在本地开业的印刷铺竞争。虽然如此，我的境遇逐渐好转了。我原先节俭朴素的习惯还是保持着。在我童年时期我父亲对我的教诲当中，有一句他常常提到的所罗门的箴言说：“若是一个人勤勉从事，他将站在君王的面前，他将不站在普通人面前。”因此我认为勤勉是发财和成名的手段。这一信仰鼓励了我，虽然我从没有想到我会真正地站在君王面前。但是这一点倒真的已经做到了，因为我曾经站在五个国王面前过，甚至还曾有过跟一个国王同坐吃饭的光荣——那就是跟丹麦国王。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We have an English proverb that says, "He that would thrive, must ask his wife." It was lucky for me that I had one as much dispos'd to industry and frugality as myself. She assisted me cheerfully in my business, folding and stitching pamphlets, tending shop, purchasing old linen rags for the papermakers, etc., etc. We kept no idle servants, our table was plain and simple, our furniture of the cheapest. For instance, my breakfast was a long time bread and milk (no tea), and I ate it out of a twopenny earthen porringer, with a pewter spoon. But mark how luxury will enter families, and make a progress, in spite of principle: being call'd one morning to breakfast, I found it in a China bowl, with a spoon of silver! They had been bought for me without my knowledge by my wife, and had cost her the enormous sum of three-and-twenty shillings, for which she had no other excuse or apology to make, but that she thought her husband deserv'd a silver spoon and China bowl as well as any of his neighbors. This was the first appearance of plate and China in our house, which afterward, in a course of years, as our wealth increas'd, augmented gradually to several hundred pounds in value.</div>

<div class="line_en">I had been religiously educated as a Presbyterian; and tho' some of the dogmas of that persuasion, such as the eternal decrees of God, election, reprobation, etc., appeared to me unintelligible, others doubtful, and I early absented myself from the public assemblies of the sect, Sunday being my studying day, I never was without some religious principles. I never doubted, for instance, the existence of the Deity; that he made the world, and govern'd it by his Providence; that the most acceptable service of God was the doing good to man; that our souls are immortal; and that all crime will be punished, and virtue rewarded, either here or hereafter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在宗教方面我从小所受的是长老会的教养。虽然长老会的某些教条，例如：上帝的永恒判决，上帝的选拔，上帝的定罪等等，听起来莫名其妙，其他的一些教条也是可疑的。尽管我从早年起就不到长老会教堂去做礼拜，因为礼拜天是我读书的日子，但是我仍然保持着某些宗教信仰，比方说，我从不怀疑上帝的存在，上帝创造世界，上帝按照上帝的旨意统治世界，上帝最喜悦的贡献是对人行善，我们的灵魂是不朽的，善有善报，恶有恶报，这种报应不是在今世，就是在来世。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">These I esteem'd the essentials of every religion; and, being to be found in all the religions we had in our country, I respected them all, tho' with different degrees of respect, as I found them more or less mix'd with other articles, which, without any tendency to inspire, promote, or confirm morality, serv'd principally to divide us, and make us unfriendly to one another. This respect to all, with an opinion that the worst had some good effects, induc'd me to avoid all discourse that might tend to lessen the good opinion another might have of his own religion; and as our province increas'd in people, and new places of worship were continually wanted, and generally erected by voluntary contributions, my mite for such purpose, whatever might be the sect, was never refused.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tho' I seldom attended any public worship, I had still an opinion of its propriety, and of its utility when rightly conducted, and I regularly paid my annual subscription for the support of the only Presbyterian minister or meeting we had in Philadelphia. He us'd to visit me sometimes as a friend, and admonish me to attend his administrations, and I was now and then prevail'd on to do so, once for five Sundays successively. Had he been in my opinion a good preacher, perhaps I might have continued, notwithstanding the occasion I had for the Sunday's leisure in my course of study; but his discourses were chiefly either polemic arguments, or explications of the peculiar doctrines of our sect, and were all to me very dry, uninteresting, and unedifying, since not a single moral principle was inculcated or enforc'd, their aim seeming to be rather to make us Presbyterians than good citizens.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然我很少参加任何公共礼拜，我仍然认为做礼拜是应该的，有用的，假如主持得当的话。我定期地缴付年捐，维持费城唯一的长老会牧师或教堂。这位牧师有时以友人的身份来看我，劝我到他的教堂去做礼拜，有时候我也给他拖去参加礼拜，有一次连续去了五个礼拜天。假如当时我认为他是一个好的传教士，也许我会继续去做礼拜，尽管我需要礼拜天的空闲时间来读书。但是他的讲道的主题不是神学上的争论，就是阐述长老会独特的教条，这些对我来讲全是十分枯燥无味，毫无启发性的，因为这种讲道从不宣扬或鼓吹一条道德伦理原则，它的目的好像是要我们做长老会的教友，而不是要我们做好公民。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At length he took for his text that verse of the fourth chapter of Philippians, "Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true, honest, just, pure, lovely, or of good report, if there be any virtue, or any praise, think on these things." And I imagin'd, in a sermon on such a text, we could not miss of having some morality. But he confin'd himself to five points only, as meant by the apostle, viz.: 1. Keeping holy the Sabbath day. 2. Being diligent in reading the holy Scriptures. 3. Attending duly the publick worship. 4. Partaking of the Sacrament. 5. Paying a due respect to God's ministers. These might be all good things; but, as they were not the kind of good things that I expected from that text, I despaired of ever meeting with them from any other, was disgusted, and attended his preaching no more. I had some years before compos'd a little Liturgy, or form of prayer, for my own private use (viz., in 1728), entitled, Articles of Belief and Acts of Religion. I return'd to the use of this, and went no more to the public assemblies. My conduct might be blameable, but I leave it, without attempting further to excuse it; my present purpose being to relate facts, and not to make apologies for them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后来，他用腓立比人书第四章中的某一节作为经文：“最后，弟兄们，凡是真实的，正直的，公正的，纯洁的，可爱的，有美名的，若是有什么德行或是任何可赞美的地方，你们都要加以思考。”我想用这样一段经文做主题的讲道总不会不讲到一些道德了吧。但是他讲的只限于五点，认为这五点就是使徒的本意。它们是：一、虔守安息日；二、勤读《圣经》；三、按时做礼拜；四、参加圣典；五、尊敬教牧师。这些可能全是好东西，但不是我意料中从那段经文里引申出来的好东西，我再也不能希望从任何其他经文中遇到我所要的好东西了，我讨厌极了，以后再也不去听他的道了。在这以前（一七二八年）我曾经编了一本小小的祈祷书或祈祷文，准备我自己私人使用，叫做“信条和宗教条例”。我又重新使用这本祈祷书，不再到教堂做礼拜去了。我这一举动可能是不对的，但是我撇开不提，不再设法加以宽宥，因为我当前的目的是叙述事实，而不是替事实辩护。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the various enumerations of the moral virtues I had met with in my reading, I found the catalogue more or less numerous, as different writers included more or fewer ideas under the same name. Temperance, for example, was by some confined to eating and drinking, while by others it was extended to mean the moderating every other pleasure, appetite, inclination, or passion, bodily or mental, even to our avarice and ambition. I propos'd to myself, for the sake of clearness, to use rather more names, with fewer ideas annex'd to each, than a few names with more ideas; and I included under thirteen names of virtues all that at that time occurr'd to me as necessary or desirable, and annexed to each a short precept, which fully express'd the extent I gave to its meaning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在我的阅读中，我发现在列举道德品质时，各家的分类多少有点分歧，因为对不同的作者同一个词的涵义可以或多或少。节制这个词，比方说，有人把它的意义限于饮食，但另外有人却使它的意义包括调节其他的快乐、欲望、癖好和肉体的或精神的情欲，甚至把它推广到贪婪和野心方面。为了明确起见，我主张宁可多设几个项目，每一项底下少包括一点涵义，不要项目少而涵义多。我提出了十三种德行，这是当时我认为是必需的或是相宜的全部德行名目，在每一项底下我加了一些简单的箴言，充分地说明了我认为该词涵义应有的范围。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was about this time I conceiv'd the bold and arduous project of arriving at moral perfection. I wish'd to live without committing any fault at any time; I would conquer all that either natural inclination, custom, or company might lead me into. As I knew, or thought I knew, what was right and wrong, I did not see why I might not always do the one and avoid the other. But I soon found I had undertaken a task of more difficulty than I bad imagined. While my care was employ'd in guarding against one fault, I was often surprised by another; habit took the advantage of inattention; inclination was sometimes too strong for reason. I concluded, at length, that the mere speculative conviction that it was our interest to be completely virtuous, was not sufficient to prevent our slipping; and that the contrary habits must be broken, and good ones acquired and established, before we can have any dependence on a steady, uniform rectitude of conduct. For this purpose I therefore contrived the following method.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在这时前后，我想出了一个达到完美品德的大胆而费力的计划。我希望我一生中在任何时候能够不犯任何错误，我要克服所有缺点，不管它们由天生的爱好，或是习惯，或是交友不善所引起的。因为我知道，或是自以为知道何者为善，何者为恶，我想我或许可以做到只做好事不做坏事的地步。但是不久我发现了我想做的工作比我想象的要困难得多。正当我聚精会神地在克服某一缺点时，出乎我意料以外地另外一个缺点却冒出来了。习惯利用了一时的疏忽，理智有时候又不是癖好的敌手。后来我终于断定，光是抽象地相信完善的品德是于我们有利的，还不足以防止过失的发生，坏的习惯必须打破，好的习惯必须加以培养，然后我们才能希望我们的举止能够坚定不移始终如一地正确。为了达到这个目标，因此我想出了下面的一个方法。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">My intention being to acquire the habitude of all these virtues, I judg'd it would be well not to distract my attention by attempting the whole at once, but to fix it on one of them at a time; and, when I should be master of that, then to proceed to another, and so on, till I should have gone thro' the thirteen; and, as the previous acquisition of some might facilitate the acquisition of certain others, I arrang'd them with that view, as they stand above. Temperance first, as it tends to procure that coolness and clearness of head, which is so necessary where constant vigilance was to be kept up, and guard maintained against the unremitting attraction of ancient habits, and the force of perpetual temptations. This being acquir'd and establish'd, Silence would be more easy; and my desire being to gain knowledge at the same time that I improv'd in virtue, and considering that in conversation it was obtain'd rather by the use of the ears than of the tongue, and therefore wishing to break a habit I was getting into of prattling, punning, and joking, which only made me acceptable to trifling company, I gave Silence the second place. This and the next, Order, I expected would allow me more time for attending to my project and my studies. Resolution, once become habitual, would keep me firm in my endeavors to obtain all the subsequent virtues; Frugality and Industry freeing me from my remaining debt, and producing affluence and independence, would make more easy the practice of Sincerity and Justice, etc., etc. Conceiving then, that, agreeably to the advice of Pythagoras in his Golden Verses, daily examination would be necessary, I contrived the following method for conducting that examination.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="既然我的目的是在养成这一切美德的习惯，我认为最好还是不要立刻全面地去尝试，以致分散注意力，最好还是在一个时期内集中精力对付其中的一个。当我掌握了那个美德以后，接着就开始注意另外一个，这样下去，直等到我做到了十三条为止。因为先获得的一些美德可以便利其他美德的培养，所以我就按照这个主张把它们像上面的次序排列起来。我把节制放在第一，因为它可能使我头脑冷静，思想清楚。为了经常保持警惕，抵抗旧习惯不断的吸力和无穷无尽的试探的引诱，这种冷静的头脑和清晰的思想是必要的，在获得和养成了这一美德以后，沉默寡言就容易得多了。在改进我品德的同时我还想增进知识，我认为在谈话时与其用嘴还不如用耳朵更能增进知识，因此我想打破我当时正在形成的爱好喋喋不休、爱说俏皮话、爱戏谑的习惯。这种习惯使我只能与轻浮的人交友，因此我给了沉默寡言第二位。在获得了这一项和下一项（生活秩序）的美德以后，我估计会使我有更多的时间来执行我的计划来读书。养成了有决心这一习惯后，我就能更坚决地努力获得其余的美德了。俭朴和勤勉能使我还清债款的余数，会给我财富和产业，会使诚恳和公正的实践更加容易，等等等等。接着，按照毕达哥拉斯在他的“金诗篇”里所提出的意见，我认为每日必须检查，因此我想出下面的方法来进行考查。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I made a little book, in which I allotted a page for each of the virtues. I rul'd each page with red ink, so as to have seven columns, one for each day of the week, marking each column with a letter for the day. I cross'd these columns with thirteen red lines, marking the beginning of each line with the first letter of one of the virtues, on which line, and in its proper column, I might mark, by a little black spot, every fault I found upon examination to have been committed respecting that virtue upon that day.</div>

<div class="line_en">I determined to give a week's strict attention to each of the virtues successively. Thus, in the first week, my great guard was to avoid every the least offence against Temperance, leaving the other virtues to their ordinary chance, only marking every evening the faults of the day. Thus, if in the first week I could keep my first line, marked T, clear of spots, I suppos'd the habit of that virtue so much strengthen'd and its opposite weaken'd, that I might venture extending my attention to include the next, and for the following week keep both lines clear of spots. Proceeding thus to the last, I could go thro' a course compleat in thirteen weeks, and four courses in a year. And like him who, having a garden to weed, does not attempt to eradicate all the bad herbs at once, which would exceed his reach and his strength, but works on one of the beds at a time, and, having accomplish'd the first, proceeds to a second, so I should have, I hoped, the encouraging pleasure of seeing on my pages the progress I made in virtue, by clearing successively my lines of their spots, till in the end, by a number of courses, I should he happy in viewing a clean book, after a thirteen weeks' daily examination.</div>

<div class="line_en">My scheme of ORDER gave me the most trouble; and I found that, tho' it might be practicable where a man's business was such as to leave him the disposition of his time, that of a journeyman printer, for instance, it was not possible to be exactly observed by a master, who must mix with the world, and often receive people of business at their own hours. Order, too, with regard to places for things, papers, etc., I found extreamly difficult to acquire. I had not been early accustomed to it, and, having an exceeding good memory, I was not so sensible of the inconvenience attending want of method. This article, therefore, cost me so much painful attention, and my faults in it vexed me so much, and I made so little progress in amendment, and had such frequent relapses, that I was almost ready to give up the attempt, and content myself with a faulty character in that respect, like the man who, in buying an ax of a smith, my neighbour, desired to have the whole of its surface as bright as the edge. The smith consented to grind it bright for him if he would turn the wheel; he turn'd, while the smith press'd the broad face of the ax hard and heavily on the stone, which made the turning of it very fatiguing. The man came every now and then from the wheel to see how the work went on, and at length would take his ax as it was, without farther grinding. "No," said the smith, "turn on, turn on; we shall have it bright by-and-by; as yet, it is only speckled." "Yes," said the man, "but I think I like a speckled ax best." And I believe this may have been the case with many, who, having, for want of some such means as I employ'd, found the difficulty of obtaining good and breaking bad habits in other points of vice and virtue, have given up the struggle, and concluded that "a speckled ax was best"; for something, that pretended to be reason, was every now and then suggesting to me that such extream nicety as I exacted of myself might be a kind of foppery in morals, which, if it were known, would make me ridiculous; that a perfect character might be attended with the inconvenience of being envied and hated; and that a benevolent man should allow a few faults in himself, to keep his friends in countenance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="关于“生活秩序”的这一项给了我最多的麻烦。我发现虽然对于一个，比方说，像印刷所职工这样的人，他的工作固定，他可以安排他的时间，他或许可以做到每事有一定时间的地步，一个老板必须出外应酬，在任何时间接待因事来访的客人，那他就不可能严格遵守这一点了。关于杂物、文件等等的安放必须有一定地方这一秩序问题，我发现也是十分难做到的。早年的时候我不习惯于这样做，因为我的记忆力非常好，所以我也不觉得因这种缺乏秩序乱放东西所引起的不便。因此这一条却花了我不少的心血和努力，我因为这些过失而感到那么烦恼，我在这方面改进得那么慢，而且又是那样地常常故态复萌，我几乎要放弃这种企图，使我自己满足于在这方面缺陷不全的品德了。这正像一个人向我的邻居铁匠买了一把斧头，他要求铁匠把整把斧头磨得像斧口一样亮。铁匠同意替他磨亮假如他愿意摇转磨刀的轮子的话，他摇了，铁匠把斧头广阔的一面紧紧地重重地贴在磨刀轮的石上，这样使得摇轮子很吃力。那人不时地从轮子的地方跑过来看看究竟工作进行到什么程度，最后他不想再磨了，宁可接受原来的斧头了。“不，”铁匠说，“继续摇吧，继续摇吧。慢慢地我们就会把它磨亮的。现在只是有了斑点罢了。”“是的，”那人说，“但是我想我最喜欢一把有斑点的斧头”。我相信许多人都是这样，他们因为没有像我使用的那些方法，在其他道德和恶习方面发现要获得好习惯打破坏习惯是艰难的，所以就不再努力了，最后断定“一把有斑点的斧头是最好的了”。因为某些冒充理智的东西不时地在暗示我说，像我这样极度吹毛求疵地苛求于我自己或许竟是一种道德上的蠢事，假如有人知道了，我将成为笑柄。又说一个完善的品德会引起别人的忌妒和敌视，那倒反而麻烦了。又说一个仁慈的人会允许自己有一些过失，替他的朋友们留一点面子。">查看中文翻译</div>

I purposed writing a little comment on each virtue, in which I would have shown the advantages of possessing it, and the mischiefs attending its opposite vice; and I should have called my book THE ART OF VIRTUE because it would have shown the means and manner of obtaining virtue, which would have distinguished it from the mere exhortation to be good, that does not instruct and indicate the means, but is like the apostle's man of verbal charity, who only without showing to the naked and hungry how or where they might get clothes or victuals, exhorted them to be fed and clothed.-James ii. 15, 16.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="应当注意的是：虽然我这一计划并不是完全没有宗教，但是其中却没有任何教派的特殊教条的迹象。我故意避免这些教条，因为我深信我的方法是有用而极优秀的，对于信仰各种教派的人都可能有用，并且我早晚打算把它发表，因此我不愿意它包含任何足以引起任何教派的人反对的东西。我曾打算替每一条美德写一些说明，指出获得这种品德的好处和与它相反的恶习的危害性。我原打算称这本书为《道德的艺术》没有一样东西能像道德一样地使人发财致富［富兰克林原注］。，因为它会指出养成这些美德的方法和方式，这就使它与那些仅仅劝人为善的书籍有所区别。这种空洞的理论不教诲人，也不指出方法，但是正像那个使徒的口头慈善家一样，不向赤身裸体的和饥饿的人指出怎样或何处他们可以找到衣服或食物，而只是劝告他们吃饱穿暖（《新约·雅各书》第二章，十五、十六两节）。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But it so happened that my intention of writing and publishing this comment was never fulfilled. I did, indeed, from time to time, put down short hints of the sentiments, reasonings, etc., to be made use of in it, some of which I have still by me; but the necessary close attention to private business in the earlier part of thy life, and public business since, have occasioned my postponing it; for, it being connected in my mind with a great and extensive project, that required the whole man to execute, and which an unforeseen succession of employs prevented my attending to, it has hitherto remain'd unfinish'd.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是碰巧我撰写和发表这些说明的打算从未实现。的确，我常常记下一些短短有关的感想、论断等的笔记，以备日后应用，有一部分我还保存到现在哩！但是由于我早年对私人事业和日后对国家大事必须加以密切的注意，使我不得不把它耽搁了。因为既然我认为它跟一个巨大的广泛的计划有关，而这个计划又需要一个人的全部精力去执行，一连串非预料所及的职务使我无法实现这一计划，因此这些说明也就迄今尚未脱稿。">查看中文翻译</div>
