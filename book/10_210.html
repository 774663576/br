<div class="line_en">"But they cannot reach the Mountain unmarked," said Roäc, "and I fear lest there be battle in the valley. I do not call this counsel good. Though they are a grim folk, they are not likely to overcome the host that besets you; and even if they did so, what will you gain? Winter and snow is hastening behind them. How shall you be fed without the friendship and goodwill of the lands about you? The treasure is likely to be your death, though the dragon is no more!"</div>

<div class="line_en">Now the days passed slowly and wearily. Many of the dwarves spent their time piling and ordering the treasure; and now Thorin spoke of the Arkenstone of Thrain, and bade them eagerly to look for it in every corner.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接下来的日子过得漫长而又疲惫。大部分的矮人都把时间花在堆放和整理宝藏上，索林跟大家提起了瑟莱因的阿肯宝钻，要求他们务必翻遍每一个角落替他寻找。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"For the Arkenstone of my father," he said, "is worth more than a river of gold in itself, and to me it is beyond price. That stone of all the treasure I name unto myself, and I will be avenged on anyone who finds it and withholds it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那是我父亲传下来的阿肯宝钻，它比一整条河的黄金还值钱。”他说，“对我来说它是无价之宝，所有宝藏中我只将其归入我的名下，谁如果找到宝石后自己收下了，我一定跟他势不两立。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Things had gone on like this for some time, when the ravens brought news that Dain and more than five hundred dwarves, hurrying from the Iron Hills, were now within about two days' march of Dale, coming from the North-East.</div>

<div class="line_en">Bilbo heard these words and he grew afraid, wondering what would happen, if the stone was found-wrapped in an old bundle of tattered oddments that he used as a pillow. All the same he did not speak of it, for as the weariness of the days grew heavier, the beginnings of a plan had come into his little head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="比尔博听了这些话之后开始感到害怕了，一直在想如果宝石被发现了不知该如何是好——那宝石就被他包在当枕头的破布包袱里。不过，他还是没有把此事说出口，因为随着日子过得越来越消沉，一个新的计划钻进了他的小脑袋里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But Thorin was not moved. "Winter and snow will bite both men and elves," he said, "and they may find their dwelling in the waste grievous to bear. With my friends behind them and winter upon them, they will perhaps be in softer mood to parley with."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但索林依旧不为所动。“冬天和大雪也同样会伤害人类和精灵，”他说，“他们会发现野地中的营盘难以忍受。在我的朋友从后面夹攻，又有老天的帮忙，或许他们在谈判桌上的态度会软下来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That night Bilbo made up his mind. The sky was black and moonless. As soon as it was full dark, he went to a corner of an inner chamber just within the gate and drew from his bundle a rope, and also the Arkenstone wrapped in a rag. Then he climbed to the top of the wall. Only Bombur was there, for it was his turn to watch, and the dwarves kept only one watchman at a time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当夜，比尔博下定了决心。天空中一片黑暗，没有月亮。等天一黑透，他立刻走到紧靠大门的一个房间的角落，从包袱中掏出一根绳索，以及包在一块破布里的阿肯宝钻。接着他爬到城墙顶端，那里只有邦伯在，因为正好轮到他守夜，矮人们人手有限，每次只能派一个人放哨。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It is mighty cold!" said Bombur. "I wish we could have a fire up here as they have in the camp!"</div>

<div class="line_en">"I daresay; but I am bound here till midnight," grumbled the fat dwarf. "A sorry business altogether. Not that I venture to disagree with Thorin, may his beard grow ever longer; yet he was ever a dwarf with a stiff neck."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我想也是，但我得在这儿守到半夜。”胖矮人嘟囔道，“真是没劲，不是我要背地里说索林闲话，愿他的胡子能长得再长一点，可他实在是个固执的‘僵脖子’。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As soon as Bombur had gone, Bilbo put on his ring, fastened his rope, slipped down over the wall, and was gone. He had about five hours before him. Bombur would sleep (he could sleep at any time, and ever since the adventure in the forest he was always trying to recapture the beautiful dreams he had then); and all the others were busy with Thorin. It was unlikely that any, even Fili or Kili, would come out on the wall until it was their turn.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邦伯一走，比尔博戴上戒指，系好绳索，从墙上溜了下去，走了。他大概有五个小时的时间可以支配。邦伯肯定会睡着（他任何时候都能睡着，而且自从经历了森林中的奇遇之后，他一直想要重回当时的美好梦境），其他人都在和索林一起忙。所有的人，即使是菲力和奇力，也不可能在轮到他们站哨之前跑到城墙上来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was very dark, and the road after a while, when he left the newly made path and climbed down towards the lower course of the stream, was strange to him. At last he came to the bend where he had to cross the water, if he was to make for the camp, as he wished. The bed of the stream was there shallow but already broad, and fording it in the dark was not easy for the little hobbit. He was nearly across when he missed his footing on a round stone and fell into the cold water with a splash. He had barely scrambled out on the far bank, shivering and spluttering, when up came elves in the gloom with bright lanterns and searched for the cause of the noise.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="天色十分昏暗，脚下的路在稍微走了一会儿之后，也就是当他离开新修的道路，朝着较低的河道爬下去之后，变得陌生起来。最后，他来到了河水转弯的地方，如果他要如他所愿地前往对方的营地，那么他必须要涉水而过。河床虽然很浅，但河面已经很宽了，在黑暗中渡河对于矮小的霍比特人来说绝非易事。就在快要走到对岸的时候，他踩在了一块圆石上，脚下一个不稳，扑通一声掉进了冰冷的水中。等他好不容易爬上对岸，浑身发抖，牙齿打战时，只见黑暗中几个精灵打着明亮的灯笼出来寻究那声“扑通”的原因。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="虽然精灵们很吃惊，但还是很快就把他抓了起来。“你是什么人？你就是矮人手下的霍比特人吗？你要干什么？你是怎么溜过我们的岗哨混进来的？”他们的问题像连珠炮般一个又一个。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Whatever it is, it's my own, my good elves. But if you wish ever to get back to your own woods from this cold cheerless place," he answered shivering, "you will take me along quick to a fire, where I can dry-and then you will let me speak to your chiefs as quick as may be. I have only an hour or two to spare."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我亲爱的精灵们，不管是什么事情，那都是我的事。不过，如果你们希望赶快离开这个冰冷的地方回到你们自己的森林里去，”他发着抖回答道，“你们最好赶紧带我到营火边，让我可以烘干，然后再让我尽快和你们的首领说上话。我只有一两个小时的时间了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我是比尔博·巴金斯先生，”他回答道，“如果你们想知道的话，我就是索林的伙伴！我见过你们的国王很多次，不过他见到我也许不认识。但是巴德一定还记得我，所以我特别想见的人是巴德。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That is how it came about that some two hours after his escape from the Gate, Bilbo was sitting beside a warm fire in front of a large tent, and there sat too, gazing curiously at him, both the Elvenking and Bard. A hobbit in elvish armour, partly wrapped in an old blanket, was something new to them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就这样，比尔博在离开正门两小时后，就已坐在了一座大营帐前的温暖营火前烘手，而精灵国王和巴德就坐在他身旁，好奇地打量着他。一名穿着精灵盔甲、半裹着旧毯子的霍比特人对他们来说可是件新鲜事物。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Really you know," Bilbo was saying in his best business manner, "things are impossible. Personally I am tired of the whole affair. I wish I was back in the West in my own home, where folk are more reasonable. But I have an interest in this matter-one fourteenth share, to be precise, according to a letter, which fortunately I believe I have kept." He drew from a pocket in his old jacket (which he still wore over his mail), crumpled and much folded, Thorin's letter that had been put under the clock on his mantelpiece in May!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“其实你们知道，”比尔博用最像谈正事的口吻说道，“这样僵下去是不会有结果的。就我个人而言，我对这一切已经厌倦了。我希望能回到西方我自己的家里去，那里的人们更讲道理。不过，我和这件事也有利益关系——准确说来，是有十四分之一的分成。这事是写在一封信上的，幸运的是我想我还留着那封信。”他从旧夹克（他还把这夹克套在盔甲外面）的口袋里掏出一封信，皱皱的、折了好几折，那就是索林今年五月放在他壁炉上时钟下的那封信！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"A share in the profits, mind you," he went on. "I am aware of that. Personally I am only too ready to consider all your claims carefully, and deduct what is right from the total before putting in my own claim. However you don't know Thorin Oakenshield as well as I do now. I assure you, he is quite ready to sit on a heap of gold and starve, as long as you sit here."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“请注意，是净利的分成，”他继续道，“我注意到这点了。对我来说，我很愿意认真考虑你们提出的要求，在总数中扣除该扣的数目后，再来考虑我应得的收益。不过，你们不像我这样了解索林·橡木盾。我向你们保证，只要你们还留在这里，他真的愿意坐在金山上挨饿。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Quite so," said Bilbo. "I see your point of view. At the same time winter is coming on fast. Before long you will be having snow and what not, and supplies will be difficult-even for elves I imagine. Also there will be other difficulties. You have not heard of Dain and the dwarves of the Iron Hills?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“说得没错，”比尔博说，“我同意你的看法。不过，冬天来得很快，你们马上就会遇到雪啊什么的了，补给会变得很困难，我相信连精灵也不例外。你们有没有听说过戴因和铁丘陵的矮人？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I thought as much. I see I have some information you have not got. Dain, I may tell you, is now less than two days' march off, and has at least five hundred grim dwarves with him-a good many of them have had experience in the dreadful dwarf and goblin wars, of which you have no doubt heard. When they arrive there may be serious trouble."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="精灵国王问道。“和我想的一样。看来，我也有一些是你们不知道的情报啊。让我告诉你们吧，戴因现在距离这儿已经只有不到两天的路程了，他手下至少有五百名骁勇善战的矮人，其中许多人经历过矮人和半兽人那场可怕的大战，这你们想必听说过。等他们一到，事情可能就很麻烦了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"This is the Arkenstone of Thrain," said Bilbo, "the Heart of the Mountain; and it is also the heart of Thorin. He values it above a river of gold. I give it to you.

<div class="line_cn" title="“这就是瑟莱因的阿肯宝钻。”比尔博说，“山之心，这也是索林的心肝宝贝，他把它看得比满满一河的金子还贵重。我把它给你们，这会在谈判中助你们一臂之力的。”说着，比尔博将这颗美妙的宝石递给了巴德，他的身体忍不住微微颤抖着，眼睛也不由自主地投去向往的一瞥。巴德呆呆地用手接过宝石，一副失魂落魄的样子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Elvenking himself, whose eyes were used to things of wonder and beauty, stood up in amazement. Even Bard gazed marvelling at it in silence. It was as if a globe had been filled with moonlight and hung before them in a net woven of the glint of frosty stars.</div>
