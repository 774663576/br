<div class="line_en">The Paris of three hundred and fifty years ago -- the Paris of the fifteenth century -- was already a gigantic city. We Parisians generally make a mistake as to the ground which we think that we have gained, since Paris has not increased much over one-third since the time of Louis XI. It has certainly lost more in beauty than it has gained in size.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="三百五十年前的巴黎，十五世纪的巴黎，已经是一座巨大的城市。我们巴黎人，对于那时以后取得的进展，通常都有错误的看法。巴黎，自从路易十一以来，其扩大最多不超过三分之一。而且，老实说，美丽方面的损失远远超过了宏大方面的收获。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Paris had its birth, as the reader knows, in that old island of the City which has the form of a cradle. The strand of that island was its first boundary wall, the Seine its first moat. Paris remained for many centuries in its island state, with two bridges, one on the north, the other on the south; and two bridge heads, which were at the same time its gates and its fortresses, -- the Grand-Châtelet on the right bank, the Petit-Châtelet on the left. Then, from the date of the kings of the first race, Paris, being too cribbed and confined in its island, and unable to return thither, crossed the water. Then, beyond the Grand, beyond the Petit-Châtelet, a first circle of walls and towers began to infringe upon the country on the two sides of the Seine. Some vestiges of this ancient enclosure still remained in the last century; to-day, only the memory of it is left, and here and there a tradition, the Baudets or Baudoyer gate, "Porte Bagauda".</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们知道，巴黎诞生于形状像个摇篮的内城那座古老河洲（32）。这河洲的滩头就是巴黎的最早墙垣，塞纳河就是它最早的沟堑。以后若干世纪，巴黎仍然是河洲状态，有两座桥，一座在北，一座在南，有两座桥头堡，既是它的门户，又是它的堡垒，右岸的叫大堡，左岸的叫小堡。后来，早在第一王朝（33）列王统治时期，由于河洲过于逼窄，再也没有回旋余地，巴黎就跨过了塞纳河。于是，越过大堡，又超过小堡，最早的一座城墙和塔楼开始侵入塞纳河两岸的田野。这座古老城墙在上个世纪还有若干遗迹，今天只剩下回忆了，有时也有一点传统观念，例如，博岱门，又叫博多埃门（Porta Begauda）。【注：（32）现名“城岛”。（33）第一王朝，即墨洛温王朝，起始于克洛维斯一世（约466—511），终止于矮子丕平（卒于768年）。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Little by little, the tide of houses, always thrust from the heart of the city outwards, overflows, devours, wears away, and effaces this wall. Philip Augustus makes a new dike for it. He imprisons Paris in a circular chain of great towers, both lofty and solid. For the period of more than a century, the houses press upon each other, accumulate, and raise their level in this basin, like water in a reservoir. They begin to deepen; they pile story upon story; they mount upon each other; they gush forth at the top, like all laterally compressed growth, and there is a rivalry as to which shall thrust its head above its neighbors, for the sake of getting a little air. The street glows narrower and deeper, every space is overwhelmed and disappears. The houses finally leap the wall of Philip Augustus, and scatter joyfully over the plain, without order, and all askew, like runaways. There they plant themselves squarely, cut themselves gardens from the fields, and take their ease. Beginning with 1367, the city spreads to such an extent into the suburbs, that a new wall becomes necessary, particularly on the right bank; Charles V. builds it. But a city like Paris is perpetually growing. It is only such cities that become capitals. They are funnels, into which all the geographical, political, moral, and intellectual water-sheds of a country, all the natural slopes of a people, pour; wells of civilization, so to speak, and also sewers, where commerce, industry, intelligence, population, -- all that is sap, all that is life, all that is the soul of a nation, filters and amasses unceasingly, drop by drop, century by century.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="逐渐，房屋的洪流不断从城中心向四外扩展、漫溢，蚕食、销蚀，抹去了这道墙垣。菲利浦—奥古斯都为挡住这股洪流建造了一道新堤坝。他兴建了一圈高大结实的塔楼把巴黎囚禁起来。以后一个多世纪，巴黎的房屋就在这个盆子里面拥挤、堆积，像水在水库里那样上涨。开始向高度发展，楼上加楼，一层层摞上去，就像液体受压，不断向上喷射。一个个争先恐后把自己的脑袋探上去超过邻人，好多吸点空气。街道越来越深，越来越窄，任何空场子都填平了，不见了。房屋终于跳出了菲利浦—奥古斯都的墙垣，欢天喜地在平原上散布，就跟从牢房里逃出来似的，漫无秩序地到处乱跑。就在那里安顿下来，在田野里开辟花园，开始舒舒服服地过日子。早在一三六七年，城市向关厢的扩张就很厉害了，因而只好再来一堵围墙，尤其在河右岸，是查理五世建造的。可是，像巴黎这样的城市总是不断膨胀的。也只有这样的城市才成为首都。这种城市就像大漏斗，一个国家的地理、政治、精神、文化的川流，一个民族的自然川流都汇集到这里来；也不妨说是文明之井，又好似沟渠，举凡商业、工业、文化、人口，一个民族的一切元气、一切生命、一切灵魂，都一个世纪又一个世纪，一滴又一滴在这里过滤，在这里沉积。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So Charles V.'s wall suffered the fate of that of Philip Augustus. At the end of the fifteenth century, the Faubourg strides across it, passes beyond it, and runs farther. In the sixteenth, it seems to retreat visibly, and to bury itself deeper and deeper in the old city, so thick had the new city already become outside of it. Thus, beginning with the fifteenth century, where our story finds us, Paris had already outgrown the three concentric circles of walls which, from the time of Julian the Apostate, existed, so to speak, in germ in the Grand-Châtelet and the Petit-Châtelet. The mighty city had cracked, in succession, its four enclosures of walls, like a child grown too large for his garments of last year. Under Louis XI., this sea of houses was seen to be pierced at intervals by several groups of ruined towers, from the ancient wall, like the summits of hills in an inundation, -- like archipelagos of the old Paris submerged beneath the new.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，查理五世的围墙也落到菲利浦—奥古斯都的围墙同样的下场。早在十五世纪末叶，它就被跨越、超出了，关厢也跑得更远了。在十六世纪，表面上看，围墙好像后退了，越来越深入到旧城里面，因为城外有一座新城已经越来越扩充了。这样，长话短说，早在十五世纪，巴黎就已经超出叛教者朱利安（34）时代作为大堡和小堡萌芽状态的三道城墙的同心圆的范围。威力巨大的城市已经先后胀破了四道墙箍，就像一个孩子长大起来，撑破了去年的衣服。在路易十一时代，随处可见在房屋的汪洋大海中有一堆又一堆敌楼作为旧城墙遗迹冒了出来，就像洪水泛滥中冒出的山巅，那是被新巴黎淹没了的旧巴黎群岛。【注：（34）朱利安（尤利安努斯）（331—363），罗马皇帝，曾宣布不信基督教。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The City, which occupied the island, was the most ancient, the smallest, and the mother of the other two, crowded in between them like (may we be pardoned the comparison) a little old woman between two large and handsome maidens. The University covered the left bank of the Seine, from the Tournelle to the Tour de Nesle, points which correspond in the Paris of to-day, the one to the wine market, the other to the mint. Its wall included a large part of that plain where Julian had built his hot baths. The hill of Sainte-Geneviève was enclosed in it. The culminating point of this sweep of walls was the Papal gate, that is to say, near the present site of the Pantheon. The Town, which was the largest of the three fragments of Paris, held the right bank. Its quay, broken or interrupted in many places, ran along the Seine, from the Tour de Billy to the Tour du Bois; that is to say, from the place where the granary stands to-day, to the present site of the Tuileries. These four points, where the Seine intersected the wall of the capital, the Tournelle and the Tour de Nesle on the right, the Tour de Billy and the Tour du Bois on the left, were called pre-eminently, "the four towers of Paris." The Town encroached still more extensively upon the fields than the University. The culminating point of the Town wall (that of Charles V.) was at the gates of Saint-Denis and Saint-Martin, whose situation has not been changed.</div>

<div class="line_en">As we have just said, each of these three great divisions of Paris was a town, but too special a town to be complete, a city which could not get along without the other two. Hence three entirely distinct aspects: churches abounded in the City; palaces, in the Town; and colleges, in the University. Neglecting here the originalities, of secondary importance in old Paris, and the capricious regulations regarding the public highways, we will say, from a general point of view, taking only masses and the whole group, in this chaos of communal jurisdictions, that the island belonged to the bishop, the right bank to the provost of the merchants, the left bank to the Rector; over all ruled the provost of Paris, a royal not a municipal official. The City had Notre-Dame; the Town, the Louvre and the Hôtel de Ville; the University, the Sorbonne. The Town had the markets (Halles); the city, the Hospital; the University, the Pré-aux-Clercs. Offences committed by the scholars on the left bank were tried in the law courts on the island, and were punished on the right bank at Montfauçon; unless the rector, feeling the university to be strong and the king weak, intervened; for it was the students' privilege to be hanged on their own grounds.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="上面已经说过，巴黎的这三大区划，各自是一座城市，但作为城市也未免过于各专其司，因而自身也就不完整，任一皆不能没有其他两座而自己生存。因此，三副面貌彼此迥然不同。内城里尽是教堂，外城里尽是宫殿，大学城里尽是学院。这里姑且不谈旧巴黎的种种次要的独出心裁之处，也不谈变幻莫测的道路捐，只从一般角度说说混乱不堪的市政管辖的整体全貌。大体而言，河洲属主教管辖，右岸归府尹道，左岸归大学董事长。巴黎府尹（38）统管三者，他是王室官吏，不是市府官吏。内城有圣母院，外城有卢浮宫和市政厅，大学城有索尔朋（39）；外城有菜市场（40），内城有市医院，大学城有神学生草坪。学生在左岸干了犯法的事，审判得在河洲上的司法宫举行，处罚却在右岸的鹰山。除非大学董事长自认为该校强大而国王孱弱，进行干预；因为在自己校内被吊死是大学生的特权。【注：（38）府尹道是管辖市民的，巴黎府尹是王室官吏，实际上两者对立。（39）索尔朋是巴黎大学旧称，现在只是巴黎十三座大学之一的一部分。（40）最初的菜市场开始于10世纪，在15世纪已经成为有繁杂分类部门的市集，到了左拉所描写的时代甚至更为庞大。现在已经改造为主要在地下的超级市场，分门别类当然更为庞杂，不过早已不卖菜了。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">From a bird's-eye view, these three burgs, the City, the Town, and the University, each presented to the eye an inextricable skein of eccentrically tangled streets. Nevertheless, at first sight, one recognized the fact that these three fragments formed but one body. One immediately perceived three long parallel streets, unbroken, undisturbed, traversing, almost in a straight line, all three cities, from one end to the other; from North to South, perpendicularly, to the Seine, which bound them together, mingled them, infused them in each other, poured and transfused the people incessantly, from one to the other, and made one out of the three. The first of these streets ran from the Porte Saint-Martin: it was called the Rue Saint-Jacques in the University, Rue de la Juiverie in the City, Rue Saint-Martin in the Town; it crossed the water twice, under the name of the Petit Pont and the Pont Notre-Dame. The second, which was called the Rue de la Harpe on the left bank, Rue de la Barillerié in the island, Rue Saint-Denis on the right bank, Pont Saint-Michel on one arm of the Seine, Pont au Change on the other, ran from the Porte Saint-Michel in the University, to the Porte Saint-Denis in the Town. However, under all these names, there were but two streets, parent streets, generating streets, -- the two arteries of Paris. All the other veins of the triple city either derived their supply from them or emptied into them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="鸟瞰之下，内城、大学城、外城这三镇各自呈现出街道交错，奇特地扭结在一起，难解难分。不过，第一眼就可看出，这三大块还是构成一个整体的。还可以立即看出，有两条平行的长街，延展不断，几乎一溜笔直，自南而北，与塞纳河垂直，整个贯穿三城（45），把三大块联结起来，混合起来，不断把这一城的人流向、涌向、注入另一城内，三镇由此合而为一。第一条长街从圣雅各门走向圣马丁门，它在大学城叫做圣雅各街，在内城叫做犹太街，在外城叫做圣马丁街；两次过河，一次名叫小桥，另一次名叫圣母院桥。第二条长街在左岸叫做竖琴街，在河洲上叫做小桶厂街，在右岸叫做圣德尼街，它在塞纳河一道河汊上通过圣米歇桥，在另一道河汊上通过钱币兑换所桥，在大学城从圣米歇门走向外城的圣德尼门。不过，尽管名称各异，街道始终还是这两条。它们是两条母亲街、两条始祖街，是巴黎的两条大动脉。三重城垣内其他一切血管都从它们、也向它们流出流进血液。【注：（45）这两条长街今日仍在（当然已经展宽了不少），自西南南而东北东，平行穿过城岛，两端都直抵外环路。不过，不是一溜笔直的。各段街名均已更改，不一。】">查看中文翻译</div>

All these gates were strong, and also handsome, which does not detract from strength. A large, deep moat, with a brisk current during the high water of winter, bathed the base of the wall round Paris; the Seine furnished the water.

<div class="line_en">Independently of these two principal streets, piercing Paris diametrically in its whole breadth, from side to side, common to the entire capital, the City and the University had also each its own great special street, which ran lengthwise by them, parallel to the Seine, cutting, as it passed, at right angles, the two arterial thoroughfares. Thus, in the Town, one descended in a straight line from the Porte Saint-Antoine to the Porte Saint-Honoré; in the University from the Porte Saint-Victor to the Porte Saint-Germain. These two great thoroughfares intersected by the two first, formed the canvas upon which reposed, knotted and crowded together on every hand, the labyrinthine network of the streets of Paris. In the incomprehensible plan of these streets, one distinguished likewise, on looking attentively, two clusters of great streets, like magnified sheaves of grain, one in the University, the other in the Town, which spread out gradually from the bridges to the gates.</div>

<div class="line_en">For the spectator who arrived, panting, upon that pinnacle, it was first a dazzling confusing view of roofs, chimneys, streets, bridges, places, spires, bell towers. Everything struck your eye at once: the carved gable, the pointed roof, the turrets suspended at the angles of the walls; the stone pyramids of the eleventh century, the slate obelisks of the fifteenth; the round, bare tower of the donjon keep; the square and fretted tower of the church; the great and the little, the massive and the aerial. The eye was, for a long time, wholly lost in this labyrinth, where there was nothing which did not possess its originality, its reason, its genius, its beauty, -- nothing which did not proceed from art; beginning with the smallest house, with its painted and carved front, with external beams, elliptical door, with projecting stories, to the royal Louvre, which then had a colonnade of towers.

This form of a ship had also struck the heraldic scribes; for it is from that, and not from the siege by the Normans, that the ship which blazons the old shield of Paris, comes, according to Favyn and Pasquier. For him who understands how to decipher them, armorial bearings are algebra, armorial bearings have a tongue. The whole history of the second half of the Middle Ages is written in armorial bearings, -- the first half is in the symbolism of the Roman churches.

<div class="line_en">Thus the City first presented itself to the eye, with its stern to the east, and its prow to the west. Turning towards the prow, one had before one an innumerable flock of ancient roofs, over which arched broadly the lead-covered apse of the Sainte-Chapelle, like an elephant's haunches loaded with its tower. Only here, this tower was the most audacious, the most open, the most ornamented spire of cabinet-maker's work that ever let the sky peep through its cone of lace. In front of Notre-Dame, and very near at hand, three streets opened into the cathedral square, -- a fine square, lined with ancient houses. Over the south side of this place bent the wrinkled and sullen façade of the Hôtel Dieu, and its roof, which seemed covered with warts and pustules. Then, on the right and the left, to east and west, within that wall of the City, which was yet so contracted, rose the bell towers of its one and twenty churches, of every date, of every form, of every size, from the low and wormeaten belfry of Saint-Denis du Pas (Carcer Glaueini) to the slender needles of Saint-Pierre aux Boeufs and Saint-Landry.</div>

In this throng of houses the eye also distinguished, by the lofty open-work mitres of stone which then crowned the roof itself, even the most elevated windows of the palace, the Hôtel given by the city, under Charles VI., to Juvénal des Ursins; a little farther on, the pitch-covered sheds of the Palus Market; in still another quarter the new apse of Saint-Germain le Vieux, lengthened in 1458, with a bit of the Rue aux Febves; and then, in places, a square crowded with people; a pillory, erected at the corner of a street; a fine fragment of the pavement of Philip Augustus, a magnificent flagging, grooved for the horses' feet, in the middle of the road, and so badly replaced in the sixteenth century by the miserable cobblestones, called the "pavement of the League;" a deserted back courtyard, with one of those diaphanous staircase turrets, such as were erected in the fifteenth century, one of which is still to be seen in the Rue des Bourdonnais. Lastly, at the right of the Sainte-Chapelle, towards the west, the Palais de Justice rested its group of towers at the edge of the water. The thickets of the king's gardens, which covered the western point of the City, masked the Island du Passeur. As for the water, from the summit of the towers of Notre-Dame one hardly saw it, on either side of the City; the Seine was hidden by bridges, the bridges by houses.</div>

Then, if your view ran along the bank, from east to west, from the Tournelle to the Tour de Nesle, there was a long cordon of houses, with carved beams, stained-glass windows, each story projecting over that beneath it, an interminable zigzag of bourgeois gables, frequently interrupted by the mouth of a street, and from time to time also by the front or angle of a huge stone mansion, planted at its ease, with courts and gardens, wings and detached buildings, amid this populace of crowded and narrow houses, like a grand gentleman among a throng of rustics. There were five or six of these mansions on the quay, from the house of Lorraine, which shared with the Bernardins the grand enclosure adjoining the Tournelle, to the Hôtel de Nesle, whose principal tower ended Paris, and whose pointed roofs were in a position, during three months of the year, to encroach, with their black triangles, upon the scarlet disk of the setting sun.</div>

<div class="line_en">This side of the Seine was, however, the least mercantile of the two. Students furnished more of a crowd and more noise there than artisans, and there was not, properly speaking, any quay, except from the Pont Saint-Michel to the Tour de Nesle. The rest of the bank of the Seine was now a naked strand, the same as beyond the Bernardins; again, a throng of houses, standing with their feet in the water, as between the two bridges.</div>

<div class="line_en">The capricious ravine of streets did not cut this block of houses into too disproportionate slices. The forty-two colleges were scattered about in a fairly equal manner, and there were some everywhere. The amusingly varied crests of these beautiful edifices were the product of the same art as the simple roofs which they overshot, and were, actually, only a multiplication of the square or the cube of the same geometrical figure. Hence they complicated the whole effect, without disturbing it; completed, without overloading it. Geometry is harmony. Some fine mansions here and there made magnificent outlines against the picturesque attics of the left bank. The house of Nevers, the house of Rome, the house of Reims, which have disappeared; the Hôtel de Cluny, which still exists, for the consolation of the artist, and whose tower was so stupidly deprived of its crown a few years ago. Close to Cluny, that Roman palace, with fine round arches, were once the hot baths of Julian. There were a great many abbeys, of a beauty more devout, of a grandeur more solemn than the mansions, but not less beautiful, not less grand. Those which first caught the eye were the Bernardins, with their three bell towers; Sainte-Geneviève, whose square tower, which still exists, makes us regret the rest; the Sorbonne, half college, half monastery, of which so admirable a nave survives; the fine quadrilateral cloister of the Mathurins; its neighbor, the cloister of Saint-Benoit, within whose walls they have had time to cobble up a theatre, between the seventh and eighth editions of this book; the Cordeliers, with their three enormous adjacent gables; the Augustins, whose graceful spire formed, after the Tour de Nesle, the second denticulation on this side of Paris, starting from the west. The colleges, which are, in fact, the intermediate ring between the cloister and the world, hold the middle position in the monumental series between the Hôtels and the abbeys, with a severity full of elegance, sculpture less giddy than the palaces, an architecture less severe than the convents. Unfortunately, hardly anything remains of these monuments, where Gothic art combined with so just a balance, richness and economy. The churches (and they were numerous and splendid in the University, and they were graded there also in all the ages of architecture, from the round arches of Saint-Julian to the pointed arches of Saint-Séverin), the churches dominated the whole; and, like one harmony more in this mass of harmonies, they pierced in quick succession the multiple open work of the gables with slashed spires, with open-work bell towers, with slender pinnacles, whose line was also only a magnificent exaggeration of the acute angle of the roofs.</div>

<div class="line_en">Lastly, in the intervals of these roofs, of these spires, of these accidents of numberless edifices, which bent and writhed, and jagged in so eccentric a manner the extreme line of the University, one caught a glimpse, here and there, of a great expanse of moss-grown wall, a thick, round tower, a crenellated city gate, shadowing forth the fortress; it was the wall of Philip Augustus. Beyond, the fields gleamed green; beyond, fled the roads, along which were scattered a few more suburban houses, which became more infrequent as they became more distant. Some of these faubourgs were important: there were, first, starting from la Tournelle, the Bourg Saint-Victor, with its one arch bridge over the Bièvre, its abbey where one could read the epitaph of Louis le Gros, epitaphium Ludovici Grossi, and its church with an octagonal spire, flanked with four little bell towers of the eleventh century (a similar one can be seen at Etampes; it is not yet destroyed); next, the Bourg Saint-Marceau, which already had three churches and one convent; then, leaving the mill of the Gobelins and its four white walls on the left, there was the Faubourg Saint-Jacques with the beautiful carved cross in its square; the church of Saint-Jacques du Haut-Pas, which was then Gothic, pointed, charming; Saint-Magloire, a fine nave of the fourteenth century, which Napoleon turned into a hayloft; Notre-Dame des Champs, where there were Byzantine mosaics; lastly, after having left behind, full in the country, the Monastery des Chartreux, a rich edifice contemporary with the Palais de Justice, with its little garden divided into compartments, and the haunted ruins of Vauvert, the eye fell, to the west, upon the three Roman spires of Saint-Germain des Prés. The Bourg Saint-Germain, already a large community, formed fifteen or twenty streets in the rear; the pointed bell tower of Saint-Sulpice marked one corner of the town. Close beside it one descried the quadrilateral enclosure of the fair of Saint-Germain, where the market is situated to-day; then the abbot's pillory, a pretty little round tower, well capped with a leaden cone; the brickyard was further on, and the Rue du Four, which led to the common bakehouse, and the mill on its hillock, and the lazar house, a tiny house, isolated and half seen.</div>

The Town, in fact much larger than the University, was also less of a unit. At the first glance, one saw that it was divided into many masses, singularly distinct. First, to the eastward, in that part of the town which still takes its name from the marsh where Camulogènes entangled Caesar, was a pile of palaces. The block extended to the very water's edge. Four almost contiguous Hôtels, Jouy, Sens, Barbeau, the house of the Queen, mirrored their slate peaks, broken with slender turrets, in the Seine.</div>

<div class="line_en">But that which attracted the eye most of all, and fixed it for a long time on that point, was the abbey itself. It is certain that this monastery, which had a grand air, both as a church and as a seignory; that abbatial palace, where the bishops of Paris counted themselves happy if they could pass the night; that refectory, upon which the architect had bestowed the air, the beauty, and the rose window of a cathedral; that elegant chapel of the Virgin; that monumental dormitory; those vast gardens; that portcullis; that drawbridge; that envelope of battlements which notched to the eye the verdure of the surrounding meadows; those courtyards, where gleamed men at arms, intermingled with golden copes; -- the whole grouped and clustered about three lofty spires, with round arches, well planted upon a Gothic apse, made a magnificent figure against the horizon.</div>

Let us say here that a prince's apartment was then composed of never less than eleven large rooms, from the chamber of state to the oratory, not to mention the galleries, baths, vapor-baths, and other "superfluous places," with which each apartment was provided; not to mention the private gardens for each of the king's guests; not to mention the kitchens, the cellars, the domestic offices, the general refectories of the house, the poultry-yards, where there were twenty-two general laboratories, from the bakehouses to the wine-cellars; games of a thousand sorts, malls, tennis, and riding at the ring; aviaries, fishponds, menageries, stables, barns, libraries, arsenals and foundries.

One could there distinguish, very well, though cleverly united with the principal building by long galleries, decked with painted glass and slender columns, the three Hôtels which Charles V. had amalgamated with his palace: the Hôtel du Petit-Muce, with the airy balustrade, which formed a graceful border to its roof; the Hôtel of the Abbe de Saint-Maur, having the vanity of a stronghold, a great tower, machicolations, loopholes, iron gratings, and over the large Saxon door, the armorial bearings of the abbé, between the two mortises of the drawbridge; the Hôtel of the Comte d' Etampes, whose donjon keep, ruined at its summit, was rounded and notched like a cock's comb; here and there, three or four ancient oaks, forming a tuft together like enormous cauliflowers; gambols of swans, in the clear water of the fishponds, all in folds of light and shade; many courtyards of which one beheld picturesque bits; the Hôtel of the Lions, with its low, pointed arches on short, Saxon pillars, its iron gratings and its perpetual roar; shooting up above the whole, the scale-ornamented spire of the Ave-Maria; on the left, the house of the Provost of Paris, flanked by four small towers, delicately grooved, in the middle; at the extremity, the Hôtel Saint-Pol, properly speaking, with its multiplied façades, its successive enrichments from the time of Charles V., the hybrid excrescences, with which the fancy of the architects had loaded it during the last two centuries, with all the apses of its chapels, all the gables of its galleries, a thousand weathercocks for the four winds, and its two lofty contiguous towers, whose conical roof, surrounded by battlements at its base, looked like those pointed caps which have their edges turned up.</div>

<div class="line_en">Continuing to mount the stories of this amphitheatre of palaces spread out afar upon the ground, after crossing a deep ravine hollowed out of the roofs in the Town, which marked the passage of the Rue Saint-Antoine, the eye reached the house of Angoulême, a vast construction of many epochs, where there were perfectly new and very white parts, which melted no better into the whole than a red patch on a blue doublet. Nevertheless, the remarkably pointed and lofty roof of the modern palace, bristling with carved eaves, covered with sheets of lead, where coiled a thousand fantastic arabesques of sparkling incrustations of gilded bronze, that roof, so curiously damascened, darted upwards gracefully from the midst of the brown ruins of the ancient edifice; whose huge and ancient towers, rounded by age like casks, sinking together with old age, and rending themselves from top to bottom, resembled great bellies unbuttoned. Behind rose the forest of spires of the Palais des Tournelles. Not a view in the world, either at Chambord or at the Alhambra, is more magic, more aerial, more enchanting, than that thicket of spires, tiny bell towers, chimneys, weather-vanes, winding staircases, lanterns through which the daylight makes its way, which seem cut out at a blow, pavilions, spindle-shaped turrets, or, as they were then called, "tournelles," all differing in form, in height, and attitude. One would have pronounced it a gigantic stone chess-board.</div>

<div class="line_en">As we have just said, the quarter of the palace, of which we have just endeavored to give the reader some idea by indicating only the chief points, filled the angle which Charles V.'s wall made with the Seine on the east. The centre of the Town was occupied by a pile of houses for the populace. It was there, in fact, that the three bridges disgorged upon the right bank, and bridges lead to the building of houses rather than palaces. That congregation of bourgeois habitations, pressed together like the cells in a hive, had a beauty of its own. It is with the roofs of a capital as with the waves of the sea, -- they are grand. First the streets, crossed and entangled, forming a hundred amusing figures in the block; around the market-place, it was like a star with a thousand rays.</div>

There were also fine edifices which pierced the petrified undulations of that sea of gables. At the head of the Pont aux Changeurs, behind which one beheld the Seine foaming beneath the wheels of the Pont aux Meuniers, there was the Chalelet, no longer a Roman tower, as under Julian the Apostate, but a feudal tower of the thirteenth century, and of a stone so hard that the pickaxe could not break away so much as the thickness of the fist in a space of three hours; there was the rich square bell tower of Saint-Jacques de la Boucherie, with its angles all frothing with carvings, already admirable, although it was not finished in the fifteenth century. (It lacked, in particular, the four monsters, which, still perched to-day on the corners of its roof, have the air of so many sphinxes who are propounding to new Paris the riddle of the ancient Paris. Rault, the sculptor, only placed them in position in 1526, and received twenty francs for his pains.) There was the Maison-aux-Piliers, the Pillar House, opening upon that Place de Grève of which we have given the reader some idea; there was Saint-Gervais, which a front "in good taste" has since spoiled; Saint-Méry, whose ancient pointed arches were still almost round arches; Saint-Jean, whose magnificent spire was proverbial; there were twenty other monuments, which did not disdain to bury their wonders in that chaos of black, deep, narrow streets. Add the crosses of carved stone, more lavishly scattered through the squares than even the gibbets; the cemetery of the Innocents, whose architectural wall could be seen in the distance above the roofs; the pillory of the Markets, whose top was visible between two chimneys of the Rue de la Cossonnerie; the ladder of the Croix-du-Trahoir, in its square always black with people; the circular buildings of the wheat mart; the fragments of Philip Augustus's ancient wall, which could be made out here and there, drowned among the houses, its towers gnawed by ivy, its gates in ruins, with crumbling and deformed stretches of wall; the quay with its thousand shops, and its bloody knacker's yards; the Seine encumbered with boats, from the Port au Foin to Port-l'Evêque, and you will have a confused picture of what the central trapezium of the Town was like in 1482.</div>

Thus, immediately adjoining the park des Tournelles, between the Rue Saint-Antoine and the Vielle Rue du Temple, there stood Sainte-Catherine, with its immense cultivated lands, which were terminated only by the wall of Paris. Between the old and the new Rue du Temple, there was the Temple, a sinister group of towers, lofty, erect, and isolated in the middle of a vast, battlemented enclosure. Between the Rue Neuve-du-Temple and the Rue Saint-Martin, there was the Abbey of Saint-Martin, in the midst of its gardens, a superb fortified church, whose girdle of towers, whose diadem of bell towers, yielded in force and splendor only to Saint-Germain des Prés. Between the Rue Saint-Martin and the Rue Saint-Denis, spread the enclosure of the Trinité.</div>

<div class="line_en">Thus an immense block, which the Romans called iusula, or island, of bourgeois houses, flanked on the right and the left by two blocks of palaces, crowned, the one by the Louvre, the other by the Tournelles, bordered on the north by a long girdle of abbeys and cultivated enclosures, all amalgamated and melted together in one view; upon these thousands of edifices, whose tiled and slated roofs outlined upon each other so many fantastic chains, the bell towers, tattooed, fluted, and ornamented with twisted bands, of the four and forty churches on the right bank; myriads of cross streets; for boundary on one side, an enclosure of lofty walls with square towers (that of the University had round towers); on the other, the Seine, cut by bridges, and bearing on its bosom a multitude of boats; behold the Town of Paris in the fifteenth century.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这样，市民住宅这广阔的一片，即古罗马人所谓的insula（68），左右各有一大群宫殿，一边以卢浮宫为首，另一边以小塔宫为冠，北边是长长一带寺院和田园。一眼望去尽为混沌一团。这无数建筑物的屋顶有瓦盖的，也有石板铺的，层层交叠，构成无尽系列的古怪形式。在这些建筑的上面则是右岸四十四座教堂的钟楼，刺花文身，密纹细镂。数万街道纵横交错，一边的界限是方塔高墙（大学城的墙垣上则是圆塔），另一边以塞纳河为界。一座座桥梁下面无数舟楫穿行不绝。——这就是十五世纪的外城。【注：（68）拉丁文，岛。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Beyond the walls, several suburban villages pressed close about the gates, but less numerous and more scattered than those of the University. Behind the Bastille there were twenty hovels clustered round the curious sculptures of the Croix-Faubin and the flying buttresses of the Abbey of Saint-Antoine des Champs; then Popincourt, lost amid wheat fields; then la Courtille, a merry village of wine-shops; the hamlet of Saint-Laurent with its church whose bell tower, from afar, seemed to add itself to the pointed towers of the Porte Saint-Martin; the Faubourg Saint-Denis, with the vast enclosure of Saint-Ladre; beyond the Montmartre Gate, the Grange-Batelière, encircled with white walls; behind it, with its chalky slopes, Montmartre, which had then almost as many churches as windmills, and which has kept only the windmills, for society no longer demands anything but bread for the body. Lastly, beyond the Louvre, the Faubourg Saint-Honoré, already considerable at that time, could be seen stretching away into the fields, and Petit-Bretagne gleaming green, and the Marché aux Pourceaux spreading abroad, in whose centre swelled the horrible apparatus used for boiling counterfeiters. Between la Courtille and Saint-Laurent, your eye had already noticed, on the summit of an eminence crouching amid desert plains, a sort of edifice which resembled from a distance a ruined colonnade, mounted upon a basement with its foundation laid bare. This was neither a Parthenon, nor a temple of the Olympian Jupiter. It was Montfauçon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="城墙外面，城门口附近有几处关厢市镇，但数量少于大学城那边，也比那边分散。巴士底城堡后面，有二十来栋简陋房屋环绕着福班十字架教堂的那些奇特雕塑和田园圣安东尼教堂的扶壁拱架；还有波潘库尔镇，隐没在小麦地里；库尔提伊那快乐的小村庄，到处是小酒店；圣洛朗镇，它那教堂的钟楼，远远望去，好像和圣马丁门的那些尖塔连成一气；还有圣德尼关厢和宽广的圣拉德尔田园；蒙马特尔门过去，是白墙环绕的谷仓女舟子修道院；修道院后面，蒙马特尔山的石灰石山坡上当时教堂的数量大致与磨坊的数量相当，以后只剩下了磨坊，因为现今社会只需要肉体的粮食。从卢浮宫再往前看，在草场上伸展着圣奥诺瑞关厢，当时已经颇具规模；还有那小布列塔尼园林郁郁葱葱；还有小猪市，市场中心矗立着可怕的大镬，是用来煮死制造伪币者的。在库尔提伊和圣洛朗之间，你已经注意到，荒凉平原上有一座矮矮的土丘，顶上有个好似建筑物的东西，远远看去，好像一座柱廊倾颓在坍陷的屋基上。这不是巴特侬神庙，也不是奥林匹亚山朱庇特殿堂。这是鹰山。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Now, if the enumeration of so many edifices, summary as we have endeavored to make it, has not shattered in the reader's mind the general image of old Paris, as we have constructed it, we will recapitulate it in a few words. In the centre, the island of the City, resembling as to form an enormous tortoise, and throwing out its bridges with tiles for scales; like legs from beneath its gray shell of roofs. On the left, the monolithic trapezium, firm, dense, bristling, of the University; on the right, the vast semicircle of the Town, much more intermixed with gardens and monuments. The three blocks, city, university, and town, marbled with innumerable streets. Across all, the Seine, "foster-mother Seine," as says Father Du Breul, blocked with islands, bridges, and boats. All about an immense plain, patched with a thousand sorts of cultivated plots, sown with fine villages. On the left, Issy, Vanvres, Vaugirarde, Montrouge, Gentilly, with its round tower and its square tower, etc.; on the right, twenty others, from Conflans to Ville-l'Evêque. On the horizon, a border of hills arranged in a circle like the rim of the basin. Finally, far away to the east, Vincennes, and its seven quadrangular towers to the south, Bicêtre and its pointed turrets; to the north, Saint-Denis and its spire; to the west, Saint Cloud and its donjon keep. Such was the Paris which the ravens, who lived in 1482, beheld from the summits of the towers of Notre-Dame.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这么许多建筑，我们一一简单介绍，也就逐渐勾勒出了旧巴黎的轮廓。如果这还不足以在读者心目中毁坏它的形象，那么就再来啰嗦两句，予以概括。中央是城岛，形状活像一只乌龟，覆盖着瓦顶的桥梁好似它的脚爪从灰色屋顶龟壳里伸出来。左边是大学城不等边四边形，整整一大块，结结实实，密集，拥塞，毛发横七竖八。右边是外城，这广阔的半圆形里面的花园和历史性建筑比城岛和大学城都多得多。这三大块——内城、大学城和外城——都有无数街道纵横交错。流经全境的是塞纳河——按照杜勒勃耳神父的说法，那是“塞纳乳娘”，——一座座沙洲、桥梁，一艘艘船舶拥塞。巴黎四周是广阔的平原，无数田园、许多美丽村庄星罗棋布。左边有伊席、旺夫尔、蒙卢日，既有圆塔又有方塔的让提伊等等；右边是其他二十来个村庄，从孔弗朗直至主教城。天边山峦环抱，好似一个大盆的边缘。远处东边是樊尚和它那七座四角塔，南边是比塞特和那些小尖塔，西边是圣克卢和它的主楼，北边是圣德尼和它的尖顶。这就是一四八二年的乌鸦栖落在圣母院钟楼顶端时所见的巴黎。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Nevertheless, Voltaire said of this city, that "before Louis XIV., it possessed but four fine monuments": the dome of the Sorbonne, the Val-de-Grâce, the modern Louvre, and I know not what the fourth was -- the Luxembourg, perhaps. Fortunately, Voltaire was the author of "Candide" in spite of this, and in spite of this, he is, among all the men who have followed each other in the long series of humanity, the one who has best possessed the diabolical laugh. Moreover, this proves that one can be a fine genius, and yet understand nothing of an art to which one does not belong. Did not Moliere imagine that he was doing Raphael and Michael-Angelo a very great honor, by calling them "those Mignards of their age?"</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="在杜伊勒里宫，那是卡特琳·德·梅迪奇斯的巴黎（70）；在市政厅，那是亨利二世（71）的巴黎，那两座建筑至今仍然是趣味高雅的；在王宫广场，是亨利四世的巴黎（72），门脸儿是砖砌的，边角是石垒的，屋顶是石板铺的，还有三色的房屋；在神恩谷教堂，是路易十三（73）的巴黎，这是一种矮墩墩的建筑艺术，穹隆好似有提手的篮子，圆柱鼓着肚子，圆顶驼着背，真叫人莫名其妙；在残废军人院，是路易十四（74）的巴黎，宏大、华丽、金光灿烂而冷冰冰；在圣絮皮斯修道院，是路易十五的巴黎：涡卷，飘带系结，云朵，细穗，菊莴苣叶饰，这一切全是石刻的；在先贤祠，是路易十六（75）的巴黎：罗马圣彼得教堂的拙劣翻版，建筑笨拙地缩成一团，也不能补救线条的难看；在医学院，是共和的巴黎：可怜的仿希腊—罗马风格，摹仿罗马大竞技场和雅典巴特侬神庙，仿佛是共和三年宪法摹仿米诺斯法典，建筑艺术上被称为“获月（76）风格”；在旺多姆广场，是拿破仑的巴黎：用大炮铸成一根铜柱，这个巴黎倒也挺了不起；在交易所广场，是王政复辟时代的巴黎：雪白的廊柱支撑着平滑的饰带，总体呈正方形的，花费了两千万。【注：（70）我们既痛苦而又愤慨地看见：人们打算扩建、改造、重组，也就是说，摧毁这座卓越的宫殿。今日的建筑师粗手笨脚，根本不够资格去碰一碰文艺复兴时代的这些精致杰作。我们始终希望他们不这样干。况且，拆毁杜伊勒里宫如今已经不仅仅是一种粗暴行为，连喝醉酒的汪达尔人也会觉得羞愧，而是一种背叛。杜伊勒里宫不单纯是十六世纪艺术的珍品，它还是十九世纪历史的一页。这座宫殿不再属于国王，它属于人民。让它就像如今这样吧！我们的革命已经两次在它脸上打下烙印。在它那两座门面上，一座挨过八月十日的炮弹，一座遭受过7月29日的轰击。这座宫殿是神圣的。1792年，法国人民强行要求废黜国王，宣布共和，完成1789年革命未竟事业。为背叛祖国的国王和大资产阶级当政者所激怒，1792年8月10日晨，巴黎的革命人民在资产阶级左派市政府领导下，攻占这座王宫。国王狼狈逃窜，终被逮捕，次年被送上断头台处决。从此开始了法国革命资产阶级的激进专政。1830年，查理十世颁布一系列反动敕令。巴黎和全国各地革命人民再次发出“打倒波旁王朝”、“建立共和”的口号。7月29日，起义群众和一部分国民自卫军攻占杜伊勒里宫，国王仓皇出奔英国。但是，7月革命的胜利果实为金融贵族等等反动势力所篡夺，共和制未得建立，却建立了波旁支系（即奥尔良宗室）的七月王朝。曾经成为反动复辟堡垒的杜伊勒里宫本身并不是神圣的，只是由于人民革命的烙印，它才是神圣的。当然，杜伊勒里宫虽已荡然无存（1871年遭火焚，1882年拆除），它的建筑艺术仍是不朽的。（71）亨利二世（1519—1559）：1547至1559年为法国国王。（72）1624年，红衣主教黎希留着手兴建王宫建筑群，原是在亨利四世时代若干建筑物的基础之上。（73）路易十三，亨利四世的儿子（1601—1643），1610至1643年为法国国王。（74）路易十四（1638—1715），路易十三之子，太阳王，1643至1715年为法国国王。（75）路易十六（1754—1793），路易十五之孙，1774年始为法国国王，1793年被斩首。（76）获月：共和历法的第9月，相当于公历6月19（或20）日至7月19（或20）日。】">查看中文翻译</div>

The Sainte-Geneviève of M. Soufflot is certainly the finest Savoy cake that has ever been made in stone. The Palace of the Legion of Honor is also a very distinguished bit of pastry. The dome of the wheat market is an English jockey cap, on a grand scale. The towers of Saint-Sulpice are two huge clarinets, and the form is as good as any other; the telegraph, contorted and grimacing, forms an admirable accident upon their roofs. Saint-Roch has a door which, for magnificence, is comparable only to that of Saint-Thomas d'Aquin. It has, also, a crucifixion in high relief, in a cellar, with a sun of gilded wood. These things are fairly marvellous. The lantern of the labyrinth of the Jardin des Plantes is also very ingenious.</div>

<div class="line_en">As for the Palace of the Bourse, which is Greek as to its colonnade, Roman in the round arches of its doors and windows, of the Renaissance by virtue of its flattened vault, it is indubitably a very correct and very pure monument; the proof is that it is crowned with an attic, such as was never seen in Athens, a beautiful, straight line, gracefully broken here and there by stovepipes. Let us add that if it is according to rule that the architecture of a building should be adapted to its purpose in such a manner that this purpose shall be immediately apparent from the mere aspect of the building, one cannot be too much amazed at a structure which might be indifferently -- the palace of a king, a chamber of communes, a town-hall, a college, a riding-school, an academy, a warehouse, a court-house, a museum, a barracks, a sepulchre, a temple, or a theatre. However, it is an Exchange. An edifice ought to be, moreover, suitable to the climate. This one is evidently constructed expressly for our cold and rainy skies. It has a roof almost as flat as roofs in the East, which involves sweeping the roof in winter, when it snows; and of course roofs are made to be swept. As for its purpose, of which we just spoke, it fulfils it to a marvel; it is a bourse in France as it would have been a temple in Greece. It is true that the architect was at a good deal of trouble to conceal the clock face, which would have destroyed the purity of the fine lines of the façade; but, on the other hand, we have that colonnade which circles round the edifice and under which, on days of high religious ceremony, the theories of the stock-brokers and the courtiers of commerce can be developed so majestically.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="至于交易所大厦，柱廊是希腊式的，门窗的开阔穹隆是罗马式的，低矮宽阔的拱顶是文艺复兴式样的，它当然是一座非常合乎规矩、非常纯粹的建筑物。证明就是：大厦顶上那层阿提刻楼（78）连雅典也没见过，那种直线真是漂亮，而且随处都有烟突管把线条切断！还得指出，屡见不鲜的是：建筑的构造极其适合它的用途，因而一看见建筑物，它的用途也就自动自己否定了自己。所以，任何一座建筑，无论用作王宫，还是议院、市政厅、学院、驯马场、科学院、仓库、法庭、博物馆、兵营、陵墓、庙宇、戏院，都无关紧要。管它的，先用作交易所再说！此外，任何一座建筑还应该适应气候条件。这一座交易所建筑显然是故意为我国这样寒冷而多雨的天气建造的，所以，冬天一下雪，就得打扫屋顶，当然它的屋顶也正是为了便于打扫而造的，于是，那个屋顶完全像在干燥的近东一样，平平坦坦的！至于上述的那个用途，它也真是再适合不过了：它在法国正是用作交易所的，要在希腊的话，当作神殿也行！诚然，设计它那种造型的时候，把大时钟掩盖起来是颇费了一番心思的，否则岂不破坏了正面美妙线条的纯净；但是，也有补偿，围绕着整个建筑盖了一道柱廊，每逢重大宗教盛典的日子，就可以在那里庄严肃穆地发表证券经纪人和商业掮客的高论。【注：（77）托马斯·阿奎纳（约1225—1274），著名的基督教神学家、经院哲学家。意大利人。他的哲学和神学体系即为反动的“托马斯主义”。（78）阿提刻文化指雅典文化；建筑艺术上指顶楼小于底下各层的那种式样。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And if you wish to receive of the ancient city an impression with which the modern one can no longer furnish you, climb -- on the morning of some grand festival, beneath the rising sun of Easter or of Pentecost -- climb upon some elevated point, whence you command the entire capital; and be present at the wakening of the chimes. Behold, at a signal given from heaven, for it is the sun which gives it, all those churches quiver simultaneously. First come scattered strokes, running from one church to another, as when musicians give warning that they are about to begin. Then, all at once, behold! -- for it seems at times, as though the ear also possessed a sight of its own, -- behold, rising from each bell tower, something like a column of sound, a cloud of harmony. First, the vibration of each bell mounts straight upwards, pure and, so to speak, isolated from the others, into the splendid morning sky; then, little by little, as they swell they melt together, mingle, are lost in each other, and amalgamate in a magnificent concert. It is no longer anything but a mass of sonorous vibrations incessantly sent forth from the numerous belfries; floats, undulates, bounds, whirls over the city, and prolongs far beyond the horizon the deafening circle of its oscillations.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="要是你想从旧城获得现代巴黎再也无法给予的印象，那你就在哪个重大节日的早晨，在复活节或圣灵降临节，日出之际，登上某个制高点，俯览整个首都，去目睹那钟乐齐鸣的奇景。看啊，信号自天而降，因为，那是太阳发出信号，于是，成千上万教堂同时颤动。首先是零星散布的钟声铿锵，从一座教堂到一座教堂，仿佛是乐师们彼此告知演奏就要开始了；然后，突然你看见——因为有时似乎耳朵也有其视觉，——你看见从每一座钟楼同时升起声音之柱、和声之烟。开始，钟声一一战栗，袅袅升起在那灿烂辉煌的晨空，径直，纯净，可以说是彼此孤立。然后，钟声逐渐壮大而溶合、混同，彼此交融，汇合为一支雄浑磅礴的协奏曲。现在只有一个块然整体的音响在颤动了，从无数钟楼回荡不已，飘扬，波动，跳跃，旋转于全城上空，把那不尽颤抖的轰然鸣响的涡卷远远投向天边之外，延绵不绝。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Nevertheless, this sea of harmony is not a chaos; great and profound as it is, it has not lost its transparency; you behold the windings of each group of notes which escapes from the belfries. You can follow the dialogue, by turns grave and shrill, of the treble and the bass; you can see the octaves leap from one tower to another; you watch them spring forth, winged, light, and whistling, from the silver bell, to fall, broken and limping from the bell of wood; you admire in their midst the rich gamut which incessantly ascends and re-ascends the seven bells of Saint-Eustache; you see light and rapid notes running across it, executing three or four luminous zigzags, and vanishing like flashes of lightning. Yonder is the Abbey of Saint-Martin, a shrill, cracked singer; here the gruff and gloomy voice of the Bastille; at the other end, the great tower of the Louvre, with its bass. The royal chime of the palace scatters on all sides, and without relaxation, resplendent trills, upon which fall, at regular intervals, the heavy strokes from the belfry of Notre-Dame, which makes them sparkle like the anvil under the hammer. At intervals you behold the passage of sounds of all forms which come from the triple peal of Saint-Germaine des Prés. Then, again, from time to time, this mass of sublime noises opens and gives passage to the beats of the Ave Maria, which bursts forth and sparkles like an aigrette of stars. Below, in the very depths of the concert, you confusedly distinguish the interior chanting of the churches, which exhales through the vibrating pores of their vaulted roofs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，这和声的汪洋大海并不是一团混沌。无论它多么宏大，多么深邃，它仍然透明豁亮。你可以看见每组音符独立蜿蜒着，从钟声齐鸣中逸出；你可以一直倾听手铃和风笛时而低沉、时而尖锐的唱和；你可以看见一个钟楼至一个钟楼八度上下跳跃；你注视着这些八度音振翅翱翔，轻盈而发出呼啸：这是银铃的声音；跌落而破碎、跛行：这是木钟的声音；你从它们中间惊赞着圣欧斯塔希教堂七口钟的丰富音阶上行下降响个不停；你看见闪亮的音符急速滑过一切音程，划出三、四个曲曲折折的光迹，然后闪电一般消失了。那边，是圣马丁教堂尖锐、碎裂的歌唱，这边，是巴士底阴险、粗暴的呼喊，另一端是粗壮的卢浮塔的最低音。旧王宫庄严钟乐的响亮颤音传向四面八方，圣母院钟声均匀地重重撞击着，犹如大钟敲打铁砧，溅出一阵阵火花。你不时看见圣日耳曼—德—普瑞三重钟乐飞扬，一阵阵各种形状的音符掠过。随后，这一阵阵宏伟壮丽的钟声微微间歇，圣哉马利亚的赋格曲式乐音穿插进来，断断续续轰鸣，如同星光的火花爆裂。下面，在这支协奏曲的最深处，可以模模糊糊分辨出各座教堂内心的歌声，从它们拱顶的每个颤动着的毛孔里渗透出来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Assuredly, this is an opera which it is worth the trouble of listening to. Ordinarily, the noise which escapes from Paris by day is the city speaking; by night, it is the city breathing; in this case, it is the city singing. Lend an ear, then, to this concert of bell towers; spread over all the murmur of half a million men, the eternal plaint of the river, the infinite breathings of the wind, the grave and distant quartette of the four forests arranged upon the hills, on the horizon, like immense stacks of organ pipes; extinguish, as in a half shade, all that is too hoarse and too shrill about the central chime, and say whether you know anything in the world more rich and joyful, more golden, more dazzling, than this tumult of bells and chimes; -- than this furnace of music, -- than these ten thousand brazen voices chanting simultaneously in the flutes of stone, three hundred feet high, -- than this city which is no longer anything but an orchestra, -- than this symphony which produces the noise of a tempest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="确实，这是一出值得静听的歌剧。通常，巴黎白天散逸出营营声，那是城市在低声曼语，夜里那是城市在轻轻呼吸；现在，这是城市在歌唱。因此，请你注意倾听这钟乐，想象向整体音响扩散五十万人的款款倾诉、河水永恒的哀怨、风声无尽的叹息、天边山丘上如同巨大管风琴奏鸣的那四座森林的遥远而庄重的四重奏，你再像半浓淡画中那样，从中心钟乐声里消除那些过于嘶哑、过于尖锐的声音；然后，请你说说世上是否还有什么声音更为丰富，更为欢乐，更为金光闪闪，更为使人晕眩，胜似这钟乐齐鸣，超过这音乐的熔炉，超过这么许多高达三百尺（79）的石笛同时铿然发出成千上万乐音，胜似这座浑然成为整个一支管弦乐的城市，超过这首暴风骤雨般的交响曲。【注：（79）本书中的尺均为法尺，每法尺合325毫米，稍短于我国的尺。】">查看中文翻译</div>
