<div class="line_en">When I broke up with yet another boyfriend, this time after a three-year relationship, I decided it was time for me to face the facts -- I was just not lucky in love. Yet even though I had given up on men, I wasn't ready to go without love in my life, so I decided to get a dog.</div>

<div class="line_en">A few days later, I received a call from a man who'd gotten my name through a computer dating club. I had joined the club before the start of my last relationship and had never cancelled my membership. I hadn't been very impressed with the people I'd met through the club's services, but this guy, Brad, seemed nice enough on the phone, so when he asked me to meet him at the lake in a nearby park the next evening, I thought, I've got to walk Cognac anyway… sure, why not?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几天后，我接到一个陌生人的电话，是通过网上约会俱乐部得到我名字的人。我是在我最近那次感情开始前加入这个俱乐部的，也从来没有取消我的会员资格。我对通过俱乐部认识的人没有很深刻的印象，但这个家伙，布拉德，讲电话时听起来很热情，所以当他约我第二天晚上在附近一个公园的湖边见面时，我想，我反正也要带着戈里亚去公园散步…当然，为什么不去呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Like all puppies, Cognac was adorable; immediately, I felt love and sweetness flowing in my life again. Why hadn't I thought of this sooner?</div>

<div class="line_en">Brad had said he was no longer in the service, but that he had been an air force tech sergeant. That wasn't the kind of guy I usually dated, but I had liked his voice on the phone and decided to keep an open mind. When I got to the park for our date, I looked around for a blond man with a buzz cut and a military bearing. There was no one like that at the park -- the only blond man was a gorgeous guy with hair almost to his shoulders. I thought, now why can't a guy like that ask me out? Then the gorgeous guy walked over to me and said, "Are you Jan?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布拉德表示，他曾经是空军技术军士，但他现在已经不服役了。他不是一般的男子，但我喜欢他在电话里的声音，决定保持开放的态度。当我到公园赴约时，我环顾四周，一直在找剪裁时髦的军装和佩戴军事勋章的金发男子。可是在公园里唯一一个金发男子是一个头发几乎到肩膀的英俊男子。我想，为什么这么帅的男人来找我约会？然后那帅气的男子向我走来，说：“是你吗？珍？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At the end of our walk, we weren't ready to say goodbye, so we found a cafe and picked an outdoor table so the puppy could be with us. From the very start, our relationship included Cognac.</div>

<div class="line_en">Cognac's enthusiastic greeting made our introductions easy. He jumped up on Brad's legs and ran in circles, wagging his whole body madly while trying to lick every part of Brad he could. We started to walk around the lake, and everybody we met fussed over the puppy. By the time we were halfway around the lake, Brad was holding Cognac's leash, and he and I were chatting away like old friends.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="戈里亚的热烈欢迎使我们相处得很容易。它跳上布拉德的腿并且围着他转，疯狂地摇摆他的整个身体，试图舔布拉德的每一部分。我们开始在湖边散步，每个人见到我们的小狗都大惊小怪。不知不觉我们已经绕着湖走了大半圈了，布拉德拉着戈里亚，和我像是老朋友一样聊个没完。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Things went from good to better. One evening, three months later, Brad and I went to a restaurant that we liked for dinner. It was one of those places that have paper over the tablecloths and when they bring you the menu, they also bring crayons so that you can draw or write poetry while you're waiting for your meal. Brad and I always played Hangman while we waited and that night, we were playing our usual game. As I guessed the letters and the words started to form themselves, a sentence emerged: Will you marry me?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们之间的关系进展得非常顺利。三个月后的一天晚上，布拉德和我去一个餐厅吃晚饭，我们都很喜欢这里，因为它在这些地方的餐馆中是有桌布纸的，当服务员来点餐时，也会送来蜡笔，以便候餐的时间可以让您画画或者是写诗。布拉德和我经常会玩游戏，而那一天在我们等待用餐时，我们玩我们一贯玩的游戏。当我猜出了全部的字母和单词时，一个完整的句子出现了：你愿意嫁给我吗？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The day of the wedding dawned perfect and clear. Our families and friends gathered near the natural spring that we'd chosen as the spot where we would say our vows. My bridesmaids were dressed in rich purple gowns. I had on my wedding dress, and my heart felt as if it were overflowing with love and joy. Yet I was slightly apprehensive, wondering if we had lost our minds expecting Cognac, now ten months old and goofy in the way that only young dogs can be, to handle his responsibilities as ring bearer without creating chaos.</div>

<div class="line_en">Somehow I managed to get to the aisle, unhook Cognac's leash and put the basket in his mouth. He was off like a shot, racing toward Brad with his beautiful golden ears streaming behind him, as if he was hot on the trail of a speeding rabbit. There was a swell of laughter as our guests appreciated the dedication of our furry ring-bearer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不知道为什么，我没有勇气走过去。戈里亚像听到了发令声一样挣脱了绳索，叼着花篮朝布拉德跑去，我只看到了它金色的耳朵，它就像只超速兔子，客人们都笑出了声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Cognac's job was to carry a heart-shaped basket containing our rings to Brad. The basket held a heart-shaped pillow to which Brad had secured our rings with pieces of wire. This would prevent a disaster, in case Cognac decided to go for a swim in the spring, basket and all, instead of delivering it to Brad as we'd planned. As I began to walk to the aisle, in preparation for following the bridesmaids, I panicked. I realized I needed another hand! I held my bouquet in one hand, Cognac on his leash in the other, but I needed to hold the basket as well. If I gave the basket to Cognac to carry, he would take it as the signal to run to Brad, just as he'd been trained and I'd be dragged after him -- spoiling the effect I'd had in my mind for my appearance on the scene.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="戈里亚的任务是将心形花篮交给我们的布拉德。篮子里面心形枕头上面有戒指。这样就能阻止意外发生，一旦戈里亚决定去温泉游泳，篮子和所有的东西都会弄丢，我们没预想狗狗能乖乖地把戒指交到布拉德手中。当我准备和伴娘走到走道里，我害怕了。我意识到我需要帮忙！我一手牵着戈里亚，而且必须抓好篮子。而我手里还拿着花束。如果我把篮子完全交给戈里亚携带，它将作为信号把篮子带到布拉德那里，就像训练时一样，我会看好戈里亚，不能让我想象中的坏情境发生。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Cognac wore a white collar and a purple satin bow tie. My bridesmaids, who knew we had lost our minds having a dog at the ceremony, ran around with lint rollers, trying to keep their dark gowns free of golden hair -- an almost impossible task.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="戈里亚身穿白色衣领和一条紫色的缎面领结。我的伴娘，不知所措地看着它在仪式上跑来跑去，戈里亚试图解开它藏在黑暗袍里面的金色秀发——这似乎是个不可能完成的任务。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When Cognac reached Brad, he dropped the basket at feet and, panting, looked up at Brad for approval. As Brad reached down to pick up the rings, a suddenly quiet Cognac solemnly raised his paw to meet my almost-husband's hand -- a canine "Way to go, Brad."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当戈里亚跑到布拉德面前，它放下篮子，气喘吁吁，看着布拉德。布拉德弯腰拿起戒指，突然安静下来的戈里亚伸出它的爪子指向我这边——就像是在说“去吧，布拉德”。">查看中文翻译</div>
