<div class="line_en">The feast tents were behind them now. They squished over wet clay and torn grass, out of the light and back into the gloom. Ahead loomed the castle gatehouse. She could see torches moving on the walls, their flames dancing and blowing in the wind. The light shone dully against the wet mail and helms. More torches were moving on the dark stone bridge that joined the Twins, a column of them streaming from the west bank to the east.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="婚宴大帐被抛在身后，马车碾过潮湿的黏土和褴褛的草地，驶出光亮范围，再度进入黑暗。前方耸立着城堡门楼，她可以看到墙垒上有火炬移动，焰苗于风中飞舞。湿乎乎的锁甲和头盔反射出暗淡的光线。连接双子城的黑石拱桥上有更多火炬，一队人马正自西岸朝东岸而行。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Hound reined up so suddenly that she almost fell off the wayn. "Seven bloody buggering hells," Arya heard him curse, as their left wheel began to sink in soft mud. The wayn tilted slowly. "Get dovm," Clegane roared at her, slamming the heel of his hand into her shoulder to knock her sideways. She landed light, the way Syrio had taught her, and bounced up at once with a face full of mud. "Why did you do that?" she screamed. The Hound had leapt down as well. He tore the seat off the front of the wayn and reached in for the swordbelt he'd hidden beneath it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="猎狗突然勒住缰绳，害她差点从马车上摔下去。“该死的！七层地狱！”艾莉亚听见他咒骂，而左面轮子陷入软泥中，马车开始倾斜。“下去，”克里冈一边朝她吼，一边用掌根猛推肩膀，将她拂下马车。她轻巧地落地，用上西利欧教的方法，然后满脸泥浆地跳起来。“你干什么？”她喊。猎狗也跳了下来，并扯下马车的坐垫，伸手去取藏在下面的剑带。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The castle's not closed," Arya said suddenly. The sergeant had said it would be, but he was wrong. The portcullis was being drawn upward even as she watched, and the drawbridge had already been lowered to span the swollen moat. She had been afraid that Lord Frey's guardsmen would refuse to let them in. For half a heartbeat she chewed her lip, too anxious to smile.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“城堡没有关门。”艾莉亚突然道。军官说禁止出入，很明显他搞错了。就在她注目观看时，铁闸门升了起来，而吊桥放下，架在高涨的护城河上。她本来害怕佛雷侯爵的卫兵会拒绝他们进入，眼见这番光景，不由得咬紧嘴唇，渴望得都不敢笑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When Arya looked around, she saw that there were only two of the huge feast tents where once there had been three. The one in the middle had collapsed. For a moment she did not understand what she was seeing. Then the flames went licking up from the fallen tent, and now the other two were collapsing, heavy oiled cloth settling down on the men beneath. A flight of fire arrows streaked through the air. The second tent took fire, and then the third. The screams grew so loud she could hear words through the music. Dark shapes moved in front of the flames, the steel of their armor shining orange from afar.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="艾莉亚环顾四周，只见原本的三座婚宴大帐，而今只剩下两个，中间那座倒掉了。片刻之间，她不明就里，直到看见倒塌的帐篷冒出火舌，另外两个也开始颠覆，厚重的油布落在人群头上。一阵火箭划过夜空，拉出道道光痕，第二座大帐应声着火，接着是第三座。惨叫声如此凄厉，她甚至可以透过音乐听清楚词语。黑影朝火焰移动，钢甲闪烁橙光。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Somewhere far off she heard a wolf howling. It wasn't very loud compared to the camp noise and the music and the low ominous growl of the river running wild, but she heard it all the same. Only maybe it wasn't her ears that heard it. The sound shivered through Arya like a knife, sharp with rage and grief. More and more riders were emerging from the castle, a column four wide with no end to it, knights and squires and freeriders, torches and longaxes. And there was noise coming from behind as well.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="远方某处，传来一头狼的嗥叫。相对于营地的喧哗、乐声及奔腾的河流所发出的险恶低哮，并非很响，但她还是听见了，也许并非耳朵听见的。嗥叫声如匕首般锐利，充满愤怒与悲哀，贯穿全身，令她颤抖。越来越多的骑兵从城堡里涌出，四个一排，没有尽头，骑士、侍从和自由骑手，手执火炬与长斧。接着嘈杂声从身后传来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was only then that she heard the riders pouring out the castle gate in a river of steel and fire, the thunder of their destriers crossing the drawbridge almost lost beneath the drumming from the castles. Men and mounts wore plate armor, and one in every ten carried a torch. The rest had axes, longaxes with spiked heads and heavy bone-crushing armorsmashing blades.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时她才听见骑兵从城门口涌出，如同一条钢铁和火焰的洪流，踏在吊桥上的隆隆马蹄几乎被城内的鼓声所掩盖。人、马都穿戴板甲，每十人中有一人擎火炬，其余则提长柄斧，带有锐利的尖头和沉重的刀刃，足以劈碎骨头，撕裂盔甲。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Clegane cut Stranger loose with a single slash of his sword and leapt onto his back. The courser knew what was wanted of him. He pricked up his ears and wheeled toward the charging destriers. In a coat of gold or a coat of red, a lion still has claws. And mine are long and sharp, my lord, as long and sharp as yours. Arya had prayed a hundred hundred times for the Hound to die, but now… there was a rock in her hand, slimy with mud, and she didn't even remember picking it up. Who do I throw it at?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克里冈一剑劈断系住陌客的绳索，跳到马背上。骏马训练有素，立刻竖起耳朵，转向冲来的敌人。红狮子斗黄狮子，爪牙锋利不留情。出手致命招招狠，汝子莫忘记，汝子莫忘记。艾莉亚祈祷过千百次猎狗的死，但现在…她手里有块石头，粘着黏黏的烂泥，都不记得什么时候捡起来的。我该朝谁扔呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She had no more time to watch the tents then. With the river overflowing its banks, the dark swirling waters at the end of the drawbridge reached as high as a horse's belly, but the riders splashed through them all the same, spurred on by the music. For once the same song was coming from both castles. I know this song, Arya realized suddenly. Tom o' Sevens had sung it for them, that rainy night the outlaws had sheltered in the brewhouse with the brothers. And who are you, the proud lord said, that I must bow so low?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她无暇再看婚宴大帐。尽管河水溢出堤岸，于吊桥尽头黑乎乎地打旋，有马肚子那么高，但在音乐的鞭策之下，骑兵们仍溅着水花强行趟过去。两座城堡的音乐到如今方才协调一致。我知道这首歌，艾莉亚忽然意识到。那个雨夜，土匪们跟僧侣一起在酿酒屋住宿时，七弦汤姆曾给他们唱过。汝何德何能？爵爷傲然宣称，须令吾躬首称臣？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Frey riders were struggling through the mud and reeds, but some of them had seen the wayn. She watched as three riders left the main column, pounding through the shallows. Only a cat of a different coat, that's all the truth I know…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佛雷家的骑兵艰难地穿越烂泥和杂草，有些人看到了马车。她目睹三个骑兵离开大队，踏着积水而来。颜色有别，威力不逊，各显神通，分个高低。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then she saw the third rider coming her way. Arya moved behind the wayn. Fear cuts deeper than swords. She could hear drums and warhorns and pipes, stallions trumpeting, the shriek of steel on steel, but all the sounds seemed so far away. There was only the oncoming horseman and the longaxe in his hand. He wore a surcoat over his armor and she saw the two towers that marked him for a Frey. She did not understand. Her uncle was marrying Lord Frey's daughter, the Freys were her brother's friends. "Don't!" she screamed as he rode around the wayn, but he paid no mind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第三个骑兵朝她而来。艾莉亚忙躲到马车后面。恐惧比利剑更伤人。鼓声、号角、笛子、马匹嘶鸣，金铁相交的尖锐响动，但一切的一切都仿佛如此遥远，世界只剩下迅速逼近的骑兵和他手中的长斧。他在铠甲外罩了件外衣，上面绣有双塔纹章，表明是佛雷家的人。她不明白。她舅舅要跟佛雷家的女儿结婚，佛雷应是哥哥的朋友啊。“不要！”他绕过马车时，艾莉亚尖叫，但对方毫不理会。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She jumped at the clash of metal as Clegane turned aside the first longaxe. While he was engaged with the first man, the second circled behind him and aimed a blow for the small of his back. Stranger was wheeling, so the Hound took only a glancing blow, enough to rip a great gash in his baggy peasant's blouse and expose the mail below. He is one against three. Arya still clutched her rock. They're sure to kill him. She thought of Mycah, the butcher's boy who had been her friend so briefly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克里冈拨开第一柄长斧时发出的金属撞击声把她吓了一跳。他与第一个人交手，第二个人趁机绕到他后面，照准背心砍下去。陌客机警地转圈，因此猎狗不过被稍稍扫到一下，松垮的农夫布衫被撕了个大口子，露出下面的锁甲。他以一敌三，艾莉亚紧紧抓着石头，肯定会被杀的。她想到米凯，想到那个曾短暂地成为她朋友的屠夫之子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When he charged Arya threw the rock, the way she'd once thrown a crabapple at Gendry. She'd gotten Gendry right between the eyes, but this time her aim was off, and the stone caromed sideways off his temple. It was enough to break his charge, but no more. She retreated, darting across the muddy ground on the balls of her feet, putting the wayn between them once more. The knight followed at a trot, only darkness behind his eyeslit. She hadn't even dented his helm. They went round once, twice, a third time. The knight cursed her. "You can't run for --"</div>

<div class="line_en">The axehead caught him square in the back of the head, crashing through his helm and the skull beneath and sending him flying face first from his saddle. Behind him was the Hound, still mounted on Stranger. How did you get an axe? she almost asked, before she saw. One of the other Freys was trapped beneath his dying horse, drowning in a foot of water. The third man was sprawled on his back, unmoving. He hadn't worn a gorget, and a foot of broken sword jutted from beneath his chin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斧头结结实实砸在他后脑，击穿头盔和颅骨，将骑士从马鞍上掀飞出去。原来是骑陌客的猎狗救了她。你怎么搞到斧子的？她差点脱口而出，接着便看见一个佛雷家的士兵被压在自己濒死的坐骑下，周围是一尺深的水；另一人仰面躺倒，四肢伸开，一动不动。他没戴护喉，一尺长的断剑从下巴戳出来。">查看中文翻译</div>

Some of the barracks tents were burning too, and half a hundred silk pavilions. Everywhere swords were singing. And now the rains weep o'er his hall, with not a soul to hear. She saw two knights ride down a running man. A wooden barrel came crashing onto one of the burning tents and burst apart, and the flames leapt twice as high. A catapult, she knew. The castle was flinging oil or pitch or something.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was stuffed at the bottom of a sack of dried apples, in the back of the wayn behind the pickled pigs' feet. Arya upended the sack and tossed it to him.

<div class="line_en">"Come with me." Sandor Clegane reached down a hand. "We have to get away from here, and now." Stranger tossed his head impatiently, his nostrils flaring at the scent of blood. The song was done. There was only one solitary drum, its slow monotonous beats echoing across the river like the pounding of some monstrous heart. The black sky wept, the river grumbled, men cursed and died. Arya had mud in her teeth and her face was wet. Rain. It's only rain. That's all it is. "We're here," she shouted. Her voice sounded thin and scared, a little girl's voice. "Robb's just in the castle, and my mother. The gate's even open." There were no more Freys riding out. I came so far.

<div class="line_en">Arya spun away from him and darted for the gate. The portcullis was coming down, but slowly. I have to run faster. The mud slowed her, though, and then the water. Run fast as a wolf. The drawbridge had begun to lift, the water running off it in a sheet, the mud falling in heavy clots. Faster. She heard loud splashing and looked back to see Stranger pounding after her, sending up gouts of water with every stride. She saw the longaxe too, still wet with blood and brains. And Arya ran. Not for her brother now, not even for her mother, but for herself. She ran faster than she had ever run before, her head down and her feet churning up the river, she ran from him as Mycah must have run.</div>
