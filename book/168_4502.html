<div class="line_en">Ser Desmond Grell had served House Tully all his life. He had been a squire when Catelyn was born, a knight when she learned to walk and ride and swim, master-at-arms by the day that she was wed. He had seen Lord Hoster's little Cat become a young woman, a great lord's lady, mother to a king. And now he has seen me become a traitor as well.</div>

<div class="line_en">Her brother Edmure had named Ser Desmond castellan of Riverrun when he rode off to battle, so it fell to him to deal with her crime. To ease his discomfort he brought her father's steward with him, dour Utherydes Wayn. The two men stood and looked at her; Ser Desmond stout, red-faced, embarrassed, Utherydes grave, gaunt, melancholy. Each waited for the other to speak. They have given their lives to my father's service, and I have repaid them with disgrace, Catelyn thought wearily.</div>

<div class="line_en">Her things were moved into her father's bedchamber, dominated by the great canopied bed she had been born in, its pillars carved in the shapes of leaping trout. Her father himself had been moved half a turn down the stair, his sickbed placed to face the triangular balcony that opened off his solar, from whence he could see the rivers that he had always loved so well.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="人们把她的物品搬到父亲的卧室，卧室中有一张带巨遮罩的大床——她便是在这出生的——床柱被雕成跳跃鳟鱼的形状。早先父亲将床移下一半台阶，面对着卧室外的三角阳台，以便观看他一辈子钟爱的河流。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ser Desmond nodded, plainly glad to be done with his distasteful task, but sad-eyed Utherydes Wayn lingered a moment after the castellan took his leave. "It was a grave thing you did, my lady, but for naught. Ser Desmond has sent Ser Robin Ryger after them, to bring back the Kingslayer… or failing that, his head."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="戴斯蒙爵士点点头，为能完成这尴尬的任务而形喜于色。眼神沉痛的乌瑟莱斯·韦恩在代理城主离开后多呆了一会，“您干了一件非常可怕的事，夫人，可这件事毫无意义。戴斯蒙爵士已命罗宾·莱格爵士前去追赶，要活捉弑君者…倘若不行，就把他人头带回。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Lord Hoster was sleeping when Catelyn entered. She went out to the balcony and stood with one hand on the rough stone balustrade. Beyond the point of the castle the swift Tumblestone joined the placid Red Fork, and she could see a long way downriver. If a striped sail comes from the east, it will be Ser Robin returning. For the moment the surface of the waters was empty. She thanked the gods for that, and went back inside to sit with her father.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯特琳进门时，霍斯特公爵正在熟睡。于是她走到外面的阳台，一只手放在粗糙的石栏杆上。城堡夹角处，迅猛的腾石河注入宁静的红叉河，越过交汇点，她可以眺望很远的下游。若有条纹风帆的船从东方出现，定是罗宾·莱格爵士无疑。但暂时水面什么也没有，她为此感谢诸神，然后回到父亲身旁坐下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a smell of death about that room; a heavy smell, sweet and foul, clinging. It reminded her of the sons that she had lost, her sweet Bran and her little Rickon, slain at the hand of Theon Greyjoy, who had been Ned's ward. She still grieved for Ned, she would always grieve for Ned, but to have her babies taken as well…"It is a monstrous cruel thing to lose a child," she whispered softly, more to herself than to her father.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="房间里充斥着死亡的气息，浓重、甜腻而腐败，附在空气里。这让她想到失去的孩子，她的甜心布兰和小瑞肯，他们都被奈德的养子席恩·葛雷乔伊给杀了。她一直沉浸在失去奈德的悲伤中，从来都无法摆脱，而今又加上两个宝贝…“失去孩子，是多么可怕而残忍的事啊。”她轻声呢喃，更像是自言自语，而不是说给父亲听。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Catelyn could not say if Lord Hoster knew that she was there, or if her presence brought him any comfort, but it gave her solace to be with him. What would you say if you knew my crime, Father? she wondered. Would you have done as I did, if it were Lysa and me in the hands of our enemies? Or would you condemn me too, and call it mother's madness?</div>

Catelyn could not blame Ser Desmond; she had given him small reason to trust her, and no doubt he feared that she might use the loyalty that many of the folk of Riverrun would still feel toward their lord's daughter to work some further mischief.

The milk of the poppy had done its work, and Lord Hoster was sunk in heavy sleep. A thin line of spittle ran down from one corner of his open mouth to dampen his pillow. Catelyn took a square of linen and wiped it away gently. When she touched him, Lord Hoster moaned. "Forgive me," he said, so softly she could scarcely hear the words.

<div class="line_en">That night Catelyn slept fitfully, haunted by formless dreams of her children, the lost and the dead. Well before the break of day, she woke with her father's words echoing in her ears. Sweet babes, and trueborn… why would he say that, unless… could he have fathered a bastard on this woman Tansy? She could not believe it. Her brother Edmure, yes; it would not have surprised her to learn that Edmure had a dozen natural children. But not her father, not Lord Hoster Tully, never.</div>

<div class="line_en">She and her sister had been married on the same day, and left in their father's care when their new husbands had ridden off to rejoin Robert's rebellion. Afterward, when their moon blood did not come at the accustomed time, Lysa had gushed happily of the sons she was certain they carried. "Your son will be heir to Winterfell and mine to the Eyrie. Oh, they'll be the best of friends, like your Ned and Lord Robert. They'll be more brothers than cousins, truly, I just know it." She was so happy.</div>

<div class="line_en">Catelyn rose, threw on a robe, and descended the steps to the darkened solar to stand over her father. A sense of helpless dread filled her. "Father," she said, "Father, I know what you did." She was no longer an innocent bride with a head full of dreams.

<div class="line_en">The next day, as she broke her fast, Catelyn asked for quill and paper and began a letter to her sister in the Vale of Arryn. She told Lysa of Bran and Rickon, struggling with the words, but mostly she wrote of their father. His thoughts are all of the wrong he did you, now that his time grows short. Maester Vyman says he dare not make the milk of the poppy any stronger. It is time for Father to lay down his sword and shield. It is time for him to rest. Yet he fights on grimly, will not yield. It is for your sake, I think. He needs your forgiveness. The war has made the road from the Eyrie to Riverrun dangerous to travel, I know, but surely a strong force of knights could see you safely through the Mountains of the Moon? A hundred men, or a thousand? And if you cannot come, will you not write him at least? A few words of love, so he might die in peace? Write what you will, and I shall read it to him, and ease his way.</div>

<div class="line_en">Small wonder her sister's marriage had been so loveless. The Arryns were proud, and prickly of their honor. Lord Jon might wed Lysa to bind the Tullys to the cause of the rebellion, and in hopes of a son, but it would have been hard for him to love a woman who came to his bed soiled and unwilling. He would have been kind, no doubt; dutiful, yes; but Lysa needed warmth.</div>

<div class="line_en">Later that day, as she sat at Lord Hoster's bedside with a book, reading the same passage over and over, she heard the sound of loud voices and a trumpet's blare. Ser Robin, she thought at once, flinching. She went to the balcony, but there was nothing to be seen out on the rivers, but she could hear the voices more clearly from outside, the sound of many horses, the clink of armor, and here and there a cheer. Catelyn made her way up the winding stairs to the roof of the keep. Ser Desmond did not forbid me the roof, she told herself as she climbed.</div>

<div class="line_en">Even as she set the quill aside and asked for sealing wax, Catelyn sensed that the letter was like to be too little and too late. Maester Vyman did not believe Lord Hoster would linger long enough for a raven to reach the Eyrie and return. Though he has said much the same before… Tully men did not surrender easily, no matter the odds. After she entrusted the parchment to the maester's care, Catelyn went to the sept and lit a candle to the Father Above for her own father's sake, a second to the Crone, who had let the first raven into the world when she peered through the door of death, and a third to the Mother, for Lysa and all the children they had both lost.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="甚至在搁笔封蜡时，凯特琳就已经感到这封信太渺小也太迟了。韦曼学士认为霍斯特公爵撑不过乌鸦往返鹰巢城的时间。尽管父亲以前常说…不论机会多么渺茫，徒利家的人从不轻易屈服。把羊皮纸托付给学士之后，凯特琳去了圣堂，在天父面前为父亲点上一根蜡烛，另一根献给老妪，是她透过生死之门向世界窥视时把第一只乌鸦送到人间，第三根给了圣母，为的是莱莎和她们所失去的孩子们。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was two hours before he saw fit to come to her. By then the castle rang to the sound of noisy reunions as men embraced the women and children they had left behind. Three ravens had risen from the rookery, black wings beating at the air as they took flight. Catelyn watched them from her father's balcony. She had washed her hair, changed her clothing, and prepared herself for her brother's reproaches… but even so, the waiting was hard.</div>

<div class="line_en">The sounds were coming from the far side of the castle, by the main gate. A knot of men stood before the portcullis as it rose in jerks and starts, and in the fields beyond, outside the castle, were several hundred riders. When the wind blew, it lifted their banners, and she trembled in relief at the sight of the leaping trout of Riverrun. Edmure.</div>
