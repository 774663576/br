<div class="line_en">Once, during a visit to her studio many years before, the bowler hat had caught Tomas's fancy. He had set it on his head and looked at himself in the large mirror which, as in the Geneva studio, leaned against the wall. He wanted to see what he would have looked like as a nineteenth-century mayor. When Sabina started undressing, he put the hat on her head. There they stood in front of the mirror (they always stood in front of the mirror while she undressed), watching themselves. She stripped to her underwear, but still had the hat on her head.</div>

<div class="line_en">And all at once she realized they were both excited by what they saw in the mirror.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后，她突然发现，这场景令他俩感到兴奋刺激。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What could have excited them so? A moment before, the hat on her head had seemed nothing but a joke. Was excitement really a mere step away from laughter?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这怎么可能？刚刚那顶圆礼帽戴在她头上还像是戏弄。从滑稽可笑到兴奋刺激，是不是仅一步之遥？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yes. When they looked at each other in the mirror that time, all she saw for the first few seconds was a comic situation. But suddenly the comic became veiled by excitement: the bowler hat no longer signified a joke; it signified violence; violence against Sabina, against her dignity as a woman. She saw her bare legs and thin panties with her pubic triangle showing through. The lingerie enhanced the charm of her femininity, while the hard masculine hat denied it, violated and ridiculed it. The fact that Tomas stood beside her fully dressed meant that the essence of what they both saw was far from good clean fun (if it had been fun he was after, he, too, would have had to strip and don a bowler hat); it was humiliation. But instead of spurning it, she proudly, provocatively played it for all it was worth, as if submitting of her own will to public rape; and suddenly, unable to wait any longer, she pulled Tomas down to the floor. The bowler hat rolled under the table, and they began thrashing about on the rug at the foot of the mirror.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="是的。看着镜中的自己，她起初只觉得样子可笑。可随后这种滑稽感就被兴奋所淹没：圆顶礼帽不再是逗乐的玩意，它象征着暴力，对萨比娜的强暴，对她的女性尊严的强暴。她看见自己，双腿裸露，一条薄薄的三角裤下边透现出私部。内衣突显出她女性的诱人曲线，而那顶男式毡帽否定了她，凌辱了她，使她变得滑稽可笑。托马斯在她身旁，衣冠楚楚，由此可知，他们所看到的，本质上不是戏弄（不然，他自己也该只穿内衣，头戴圆顶礼帽），而是侮辱。然而，她并没有反抗这种侮辱，反而以撩拨挑逗的骄傲姿态对它加以炫耀，仿佛她心甘情愿让人当众施暴一般，最终，她再也忍耐不住，将托马斯扑倒。圆顶礼帽滚落到桌子底下；两人的身体在镜子旁的地毯上纠缠起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sabina was now by herself. She went back to the mirror, still in her underwear. She put the bowler hat back on her head and had a long look at herself. She was amazed at the number of years she had spent pursuing one lost moment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="萨比娜独自一人，她重新倚在镜子跟前。她还是只穿着内衣，又一次戴上圆顶礼帽，久久地注视着自己。她很讶异，这么长时间了，还是未能忘掉已经逝去的那一刻。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Fourth, it was a sign of her originality, which she consciously cultivated. She could not take much with her when she emigrated, and taking this bulky, impractical thing meant giving up other, more practical ones.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其四，这也是她公然培植的个性的标志。当初移民过来时，她带不了很多东西，为了装上这件又碍事又无用的东西，她不得不舍下了其他更有用的物品。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Second, it was a memento of her father. After the funeral her brother appropriated all their parents' property, and she, refusing out of sovereign contempt to fight for her rights, announced sarcastically that she was taking the bowler hat as her sole inheritance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其次，它是萨比娜父亲的纪念物。父亲下葬之后，她哥哥就将父母的全部财产据为已有，而她出于傲气，死活不肯为自己的权利抗争。她以嘲讽的口气宣称，自己只保留这顶圆礼帽作为父亲的惟一遗产。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Third, it was a prop for her love games with Tomas.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其三，这是她与托马斯性爱游戏中的小道具。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Fifth, now that she was abroad, the hat was a sentimental object. When she went to visit Tomas in Zurich, she took it along and had it on her head when he opened the hotel-room door. But then something she had not reckoned with happened: the hat, no longer jaunty or sexy, turned into a monument to time past. They were both touched. They made love as they never had before. This was no occasion for obscene games. For this meeting was not a continuation of their erotic rendezvous, each of which had been an opportunity to think up some new little vice; it was a recapitulation of time, a hymn to their common past, a sentimental summary of an unsentimental story that was disappearing in the distance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其五，在异国，这顶圆礼帽成了感情寄托。她去苏黎世探望托马斯时就带上了这顶帽子，并且在旅馆给他开门时戴上了它。意想不到的事情发生了，圆顶礼帽不再滑稽，也不再令人兴奋，它是过去的残迹。两人都为之感动。他们像往常一样做爱：再也没有了淫荡嬉闹的位置，因为他们的相逢，不是为了像从前那样在性爱游戏的延续中玩出什么新的鬼花招，而是对往昔时光的回顾，对他们共同经历的过去的记忆所作的赞颂，对一个湮没于久远处的并不伤感的故事的感伤回望。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">First, it was a vague reminder of a forgotten grandfather, the mayor of a small Bohemian town during the nineteenth century.</div>

<div class="line_en">Now, perhaps, we are in a better position to understand the abyss separating Sabina and Franz: he listened eagerly to the story of her life and she was equally eager to hear the story of his, but although they had a clear understanding of the logical meaning of the words they exchanged, they failed to hear the semantic susurrus of the river flowing through them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="也许现在更容易理解萨比娜与弗兰茨之间相隔的鸿沟了：他热切地聆听她讲述自己的人生，她也怀着同样的热望听他倾诉。他们完全明白彼此所说的话语在逻辑上的意思，却听不到话语间流淌着的那条语义之河的低声密语。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The bowler hat was a motif in the musical composition that was Sabina's life. It returned again and again, each time with a different meaning, and all the meanings flowed through the bowler hat like water through a riverbed. I might call it Heraclitus' ( You can't step twice into the same river ) riverbed: the bowler hat was a bed through which each time Sabina saw another river flow, another semantic river: each time the same object would give rise to a new meaning, though all former meanings would resonate (like an echo, like a parade of echoes) together with the new one. Each new experience would resound, each time enriching the harmony. The reason why Tomas and Sabina were touched by the sight of the bowler hat in a Zurich hotel and made love almost in tears was that its black presence was not merely a reminder of their love games but also a memento of Sabina's father and of her grandfather, who lived in a century without airplanes and cars.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这圆顶礼帽成了萨比娜生命乐章中的动机。这一动机不断重复出现，每一次获得一个不同含义。所有的含义经由圆顶礼帽出现，犹如河水流经河床。可以说，就是赫拉克利特所说的那道河床：“人不能两次踏入同一条河流！”圆顶礼帽是一道河床，而在萨比娜眼中，每次流过的是另一条河，另一条语义之河：同一个事物每次激发出不同的含义，但这含义中回响着（像回声，像一连串回声）之前曾有的所有含义。每一次新的经历都会与之应和得更为和谐，使之更为丰富。在苏黎世的旅馆房间里，他俩见到圆顶礼帽都感动了，几乎是流着眼泪在做爱，因为这个黑色的物件不仅是他们性爱游戏的纪念，还是萨比娜的父亲和祖父的遗物，他们生活的时代没有汽车，也没有飞机。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">While people are fairly young and the musical composition of their lives is still in its opening bars, they can go about writing it together and exchange motifs (the way Tomas and Sabina exchanged the motif of the bowler hat), but if they meet when they are older, like Franz and Sabina, their musical compositions are more or less complete, and every motif, every object, every word means something different to each of them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="假若人还年轻，他们的生命乐章不过刚刚开始，那他们可以一同创作旋律，交换动机（像托马斯和萨比娜便交换产生了圆顶礼帽这一动机），但是，当他们在比较成熟的年纪相遇，各自的生命乐章已经差不多完成，那么，在每个人的乐曲中，每个词，每件物所指的意思便各不相同。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And so when she put on the bowler hat in his presence, Franz felt uncomfortable, as if someone had spoken to him in a language he did not know. It was neither obscene nor sentimental, merely an incomprehensible gesture. What made him feel uncomfortable was its very lack of meaning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这就是为什么当萨比娜在弗兰茨面前戴上那圆顶礼帽时他会感到困窘，就像有人用一种听不懂的语言对他说了什么。他不觉得这一举动淫荡或是伤感，这只不过是个看不明白的动作，没有意义，令他不知所措。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">If I were to make a record of all Sabina and Franz's conversations, I could compile a long lexicon of their misunderstandings. Let us be content, instead, with a short dictionary.</div>
