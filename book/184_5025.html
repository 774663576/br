<div class="line_en">The giant King and Queen looked at each other, nodded to each other, and smiled in a way that Jill didn't exactly like. She liked the King better than the Queen. He had a fine, curled beard and a straight eagle-like nose, and was really rather good-looking as giants go. The Queen was dreadfully fat and had a double chin and a fat, powdered face -- which isn't a very nice thing at the best of times, and of course looks much worse when it is ten times too big. Then the King put out his tongue and licked his lips. Anyone might do that: but his tongue was so very large and red, and came out so unexpectedly, that it gave Jill quite a shock.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jill's room was about the size of a church, and would have been rather grim if it had not had a roaring fire on the hearth and a very thick crimson carpet on the floor. And here delightful things began to happen to her. She was handed over to the Queen's old Nurse, who was, from the giants' point of view, a little old woman almost bent double with age, and, from the human point of view, a giantess small enough to go about an ordinary room without knocking her head on the ceiling. She was very capable, though Jill did wish she wouldn't keep on clicking her tongue and saying things like "Oh la, la! Ups-adaisy" and "There's a duck" and "Now we'll be all right, my poppet". She filled a giant foot-bath with hot water and helped Jill into it. If you can swim (as Jill could) a giant bath is a lovely thing. And giant towels, though a bit rough and coarse, are lovely too, because there are acres of them. In fact you don't need to dry at all, you just roll about on them in front of the fire and enjoy yourself. And when that was over, clean, fresh, warmed clothes were put on Jill: very splendid clothes and a little too big for her, but clearly made for humans not giantesses. "I suppose if that woman in the green kirtle comes here, they must be used to guests of our size," thought Jill.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔的房间有一个教堂那么大，要是壁炉里没有旺旺的火，地上没铺着厚厚的红地毯，屋里看上去就相当阴暗可怕。在这儿她开始遇上一些令人高兴的事。吉尔被人交给了王后的老保姆，从巨人的观点看，她是个上了年纪，弯腰屈背的小老太婆，从人类的观点来看，她仍算是个女巨人，只是身材矮小得可以走进一间普通房间，脑袋不至于碰到天花板罢了。老保姆非常能干，然而吉尔真希望她不要老是喋喋不休，说什么，”哦，啦啦，抱抱就好了”，“真是小宝贝儿”，“好，我们就好了，小乖乖”。她在一只巨人的洗脚盆里倒上热水，帮吉尔爬进去。要是你会游泳（吉尔就会游泳），在巨人盆里洗次澡可真妙。还有巨人的毛巾，虽然有点粗糙，也很可爱，因为那毛巾足有几英亩那么大，事实上你完全不用擦干，只要在毛巾上滚过去，滚到炉火前，痛痛快快玩就行了。洗完澡以后，吉尔穿上了干净、鲜艳、暖和的衣服。衣服十分华丽，就是大了一点，但看得出这衣服是为人做的，而不是为女巨人做的。“我猜要是那个绿衣女人上这儿来，这些衣服就用来给我们这种身材的客人穿。”吉尔想道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jill was just as indignant as you and I would have been at the mention of toys and dolls; and, though lollipops and comfits might be all very well in their way, she very much hoped that something more solid would be provided. The Queen's foolish speech, however, produced excellent results, for Puddleglum and Scrubb were at once picked up by gigantic gentlemen-in-waiting, and Jill by a gigantic maid of honour, and carried off to their rooms.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔跟你我一样，一听到提起什么玩具和娃娃，就感到气不打一处来；虽然按他们的规矩糖果和蜜钱也许不错，可是她却非常希望来点更实惠的东西。不过王后这篇蠢话倒产生了极好的结果，因为普德格伦和斯克罗布立刻被几个巨人男侍从抱起，吉尔也被一个女侍从抱走，送到各自的房间里去了。4">查看中文翻译</div>

Don't cry, little girl, or you won't be good for anything when the feast comes."</div>

<div class="line_en">She soon saw that she was right about this, for a table and chair of the right height for an ordinary grown-up human were placed for her, and the knives and forks and spoons were the proper size too. It was delightful to sit down, feeling warm and clean at last. Her feet were still bare and it was lovely to tread on the giant carpet. She sank in it well over her ankles and it was just the thing for sore feet. The meal -- which I suppose we must call dinner, though it was nearer tea time -- was cock-a-leekie soup, and hot roast turkey, and a steamed pudding, and roast chestnuts, and as much fruit as you could eat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她很快就看出她猜对了，因为一副给普通成人用的桌椅已经为她放好了，还有刀、叉、匙也都是正常的规格。终于能够暖暖和和、干干净净地坐下来，真叫人高兴。她还光着两只脚，踩在巨人的地毯上可真舒服。她的脚在里面一直陷到足踝，对痛脚来说正需要这样的东西。那顿饭——我想我们得称之为午饭，虽然那时已将近用茶点的时间了——是韭菜鸡肉汤、热的烤火鸡，还有一道蒸布丁、烤栗子以及尽够吃的水果。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The only annoying thing was that the Nurse kept coming in and out, and every time she came in, she brought a gigantic toy with her -- a huge doll, bigger than Jill herself, a wooden horse on wheels, about the size of an elephant, a drum that looked like a young gasometer, and a woolly lamb. They were crude, badly made things, painted in very bright colours, and Jill hated the sight of them. She kept on telling the Nurse she didn't want them, but the Nurse said:</div>

<div class="line_en">The rain fell steadily all the evening and all the night, dashing against the windows of the castle, and Jill never heard it but slept deeply, past supper time and past midnight. And then came the deadest hour of the night and nothing stirred but mice in the house of the giants. At that hour there came to Jill a dream. It seemed to her that she awoke in the same room and saw the fire, sunk low and red, and in the firelight the great wooden horse. And the horse came of its own will, rolling on its wheels across the carpet, and stood at her head. And now it was no longer a horse, but a lion as big as the horse. And then it was not a toy lion, but a real lion, The Real Lion, just as she had seen him on the mountain beyond the world's end. And a smell of all sweet-smelling things there are filled the room. But there was some trouble in Jill's mind, though she could not think what it was, and the tears streamed down her face and wet the pillow. The Lion told her to repeat the signs, and she found that she had forgotten them all. At that, a great horror came over her. And Aslan took her up in his jaws (she could feel his lips and his breath but not his teeth) and carried her to the window and made her look out. The moon shone bright; and written in great letters across the world or the sky (she did not know which) were the words UNDER ME. After that, the dream faded away, and when she woke, very late next morning, she did not remember that she had dreamed at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天傍晚的雨一直不停地下了整整一夜，雨点溅在城堡的窗户上，但吉尔完全没听见，只是沉沉熟睡，睡过了晚饭时刻，睡过了午夜。到了夜阑人静的时刻，在这座巨人的屋子里，除了老鼠，什么动静也没有。就在这时吉尔做了一个梦。梦中她似乎就在这间屋里醒来，看见那堆火，火力已经减弱，发红了，火光中是那匹大木马。木马轮子自动转起来，滚过地毯，停在她床头。这会儿那不是马，而是一只像马那么大的狮子了。接着它又不是玩具狮子，而是一头真正的狮子了。真正的狮王，就像她曾经在世界尽头外的高山上看见过的一样。屋里充满了各种各样的香味儿。但吉尔脑子里出了点麻烦，尽管她想不出是怎么回事，眼泪还是刷刷地流下她脸蛋，把枕头都弄湿了。狮王叫她背一下指示，而她竟发现自己已经把指示全忘光了。因此，她吓得要命。后来阿斯兰把她衔起来（她感觉到他的嘴唇和呼吸，但感觉不到牙齿），带她来到窗前，叫她往外看。外面月光明亮，在天上或地上（她不知道是哪儿）是几个大大的字”在我下面”。此后，梦就消失了，第二天早上她很晚才醒来，这时她已完全不记得做过梦了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The sun was shining and, except for a few drifts, the snow had been almost completely washed away by the rain. Down below them, spread out like a map, lay the flat hill-top which they had struggled over yesterday afternoon; seen from the castle, it could not be mistaken for anything but the ruins of a gigantic city. It had been flat, as Jill now saw, because it was still, on the whole, paved, though in places the pavement was broken. The criss-cross banks were what was left of the walls of huge buildings which might once have been giants' palaces and temples. One bit of wall, about five hundred feet high, was still standing; it was that which she had thought was a cliff. The things that had looked like factory chimneys were enormous pillars, broken off at unequal heights; their fragments lay at their bases like felled trees of monstrous stone. The ledges which they had climbed down on the north side of the hill -- and also, no doubt the other ledges which they had climbed up on the south side -- were the remaining steps of giant stairs. To crown all, in large, dark lettering across the centre of the pavement, ran the words UNDER ME.</div>

So likely, isn't it? No. We must just own up. We've only four signs to go by, and we've muffed the first three."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你意思是说我错过了，”吉尔说，“这话不假。从你带我上这儿来以后，我就把一切都弄糟了。反正都一样——说我非常抱歉什么的——反正都一样。那指示是什么？在我下面好像没什么意思吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>

No doubt, if we'd had our minds on our job when we were at the Ruinous City, we'd have been shown how -- found a little door, or a cave, or a tunnel, met someone to help us. Might have been (you never know) Aslan himself. We'd have got down under those paving-stones somehow or other. Aslan's instructions always work: there are no exceptions. But how to do it now -- that's another matter."</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's hardly what I call a Chance," said the Marshwiggle. "But it's all the chance we're likely to get." As a matter of fact, Scrubb's plan was not quite so hopeless as you might think. If you want to get out of a house without being seen, the middle of the afternoon is in some ways a better time to try it than the middle of the night. Doors and windows are more likely to be open; and if you are caught, you can always pretend you weren't meaning to go far and had no particular plans. (It is very hard to make either giants or grown-ups believe this if you're found climbing out of a bedroom window at one o'clock in the morning.)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这也说不上是一个机会，”沼泽怪说，“但我们很可能只有这么个机会了。”事实上，斯克罗布的计划并不像你们认为那么希望渺茫。如果你要走出一所房子而不让人看见，从某些方面看来，在下午这段时间试试看，倒比半夜里更好，门窗很可能都开着，万一被抓住，你总是可以装出并不是有意要走远，而且也没什么特别的打算。（要是半夜一点钟给人发现你正从卧室窗户往外爬，就很难叫巨人或成人相信这一点了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Our only chance," said Scrubb, "is to try to sneak away by daylight. Mightn't there be an hour in the afternoon when most of the giants are asleep? -- and if we could steal down into the kitchen, mightn't there be a back door open?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们惟一的机会是，”斯克罗布说，“想法在白天偷偷溜走。下午会不会有个把小时大多数巨人都睡着了呢？——要是我们能偷偷到厨房里去，会不会有一扇后门开着？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was not a pleasant idea. Puddleglum was dead against any idea of telling the giants their real business and simply asking to be let out; and of course the children couldn't tell without his permission, because they had promised. And all three felt pretty sure that there would be no chance of escaping from the castle by night. Once they were in their rooms with the doors shut, they would be prisoners till morning. They might, of course, ask to have their doors left open, but that would rouse suspicions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这主意可不妙。普德格伦坚决反对把他们真正的任务告诉巨人和干脆要求出去这样的主意。当然两个孩子没有它的许可也不能说，因为他们已经保证过了。他们三个都知道要在晚上逃出城堡是万万不可能的。一旦他们待在自己的房间里，房门关上了，他们就得一直关到早上为止。他们当然可以请求让房门开着，但那样会引起怀疑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They lost no time in rushing out past her and climbing down the first staircase they came to. The noise of hounds and horns and giant voices guided them, so that in a few minutes they reached the courtyard. The giants were all on foot, for there are no giant horses in that part of the world, and the giants' hunting is done on foot; like beagling in England. The hounds were also of normal size. When Jill saw that there were no horses she was at first dreadfully disappointed, for she felt sure that the great fat Queen would never go after hounds on foot; and it would never do to have her about the house all day. But then she saw the Queen in a kind of litter supported on the shoulders of six young giants. The silly old creature was all got up in green and had a horn at her side.</div>

<div class="line_en">Twenty or thirty giants, including the King, were assembled, ready for the sport, all talking and laughing fit to deafen you: and down below, nearer Jill's level, there were wagging tails, and barking, and loose, slobbery mouths and noses of dogs thrust into your hand. Puddleglum was just beginning to strike what he thought a gay and gamesome attitude (which might have spoiled everything if it had been noticed) when Jill put on her most attractively childish smile, rushed across to the Queen's litter and shouted up to the Queen.
