<div class="line_en">Every one of these old people was over ninety. They were as shrivelled as prunes, and as bony as skeletons, and throughout the day, until Charlie made his appearance, they lay huddled in their one bed, two at either end, with nightcaps on to keep their heads warm, dozing the time away with nothing to do. But as soon as they heard the door opening, and heard Charlie's voice saying, "Good evening, Grandpa Joe and Grandma Josephine, and Grandpa George and Grandma Georgina," then all four of them would suddenly sit up, and their old wrinkled faces would light up with smiles of pleasure -- and the talking would begin. For they loved this little boy. He was the only bright thing in their lives, and his evening visits were something that they looked forward to all day long. Often, Charlie's mother and father would come in as well, and stand by the door, listening to the stories that the old people told; and thus, for perhaps half an hour every night, this room would become a happy place, and the whole family would forget that it was hungry and poor.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Will you tell me now, Grandpa Joe, please?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那么请你现在告诉我好吗，约瑟夫爷爷？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Grandpa Joe was the oldest of the four grandparents. He was ninety-six and a half, and that is just about as old as anybody can be. Like all extremely old people, he was delicate and weak, and throughout the day he spoke very little. But in the evenings, when Charlie, his beloved grandson, was in the room, he seemed in some marvellous way to grow quite young again. All his tiredness fell away from him, and he became as eager and excited as a young boy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="约瑟夫爷爷是四位老人家中最老的一位。他已经九十六岁半，一般人大概就只能活那么老。和所有极老的人一样，他很虚弱，整天不说什么。但到晚上，当他心爱的孙子查理到房间里来时，他好像奇迹般地又变得十分年轻。他的虚弱样子一下子消失得无影无踪，变得像个小孩子一样又起劲又兴奋。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, what a man he is, this Mr Willy Wonka!" cried Grandpa Joe. "Did you know, for example, that he has himself invented more than two hundred new kinds of chocolate bars, each with a different centre, each far sweeter and creamier and more delicious than anything the other chocolate factories can make!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，这位威利·旺卡先生是怎么个人啊！”约瑟夫爷爷叫道，“比方说，你知道吗？他一个人就发明了两百多种新的巧克力糖，各有不同的夹心，比任何一家巧克力工厂的巧克力糖都要甜得多，奶油味浓得多，好吃得多！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Perfectly true!" cried Grandma Josephine. "And he sends them to all the four corners of the earth! Isn't that so, Grandpa Joe?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“一点儿不假！”约瑟芬奶奶叫道，“他把它们销售到地球的每一个角落！不是这样吗，约瑟夫爷爷？”">查看中文翻译</div>

</div>
<div class="line_en">"Quite right!" the others agreed, nodding their heads. "Mr Wonka has done it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“一点儿不假！”另外几位老人家点头同意说，“威利·旺卡先生做到了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It is, my dear, it is. And to all the kings and presidents of the world as well. But it isn't only chocolate bars that he makes. Oh, dear me, no! He has some really fantastic inventions up his sleeve, Mr Willy Wonka has! Did you know that he's invented a way of making chocolate ice cream so that it stays cold for hours and hours without being in the refrigerator? You can even leave it lying in the sun all morning on a hot day and it won't go runny!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，我亲爱的，正是这样。威利·旺卡先生还把巧克力糖送给世界各国的国王和总统。不过他不止制造巧克力糖。噢，天哪，不是的！他还有一些真正异想天开的发明。这位威利·旺卡先生真有一套绝招！你知道吗？他发明了一种办法制造巧克力冰淇淋！这种冰淇淋不用放进冰箱，却可以许多许多个钟头保持冰冻。即使在大热天，你把它放在太阳底下一个上午也不会融化！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And then again," Grandpa Joe went on speaking very slowly now so that Charlie wouldn't miss a word, "Mr Willy Wonka can make marshmallows that taste of violets, and rich caramels that change colour every ten seconds as you suck them, and little feathery sweets that melt away deliriously the moment you put them between your lips. He can make chewing-gum that never loses its taste, and sugar balloons that you can blow up to enormous sizes before you pop them with a pin and gobble them up. And, by a most secret method, he can make lovely blue birds" eggs with black spots on them, and when you put one of these in your mouth, it gradually gets smaller and smaller until suddenly there is nothing left except a tiny little pink sugary baby bird sitting on the tip of your tongue."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“还有，”约瑟夫爷爷现在很慢地说下去，因此查理一个字也不会听漏，“威利·旺卡先生能够做出有紫罗兰香味的软糖、舔下去每十秒钟变一次颜色的牛奶糖、进口就会甜津津地融化的棉花糖。他能够做出永不失去甜味的口香糖，只要不用针刺破、不用口咬破便可以吹得其大无比的泡泡糖。他还用最秘密的办法制造出带黑点的蓝色鸟蛋，你把这样一个蛋放到嘴里，它会愈变愈小，最后一下子，舌尖上只剩下一只很小很小的粉红色糖鸟。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But that's impossible!" said little Charlie, staring at his grandfather.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但那是不可能的！”小查理看着他的爷爷说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Of course it's impossible!" cried Grandpa Joe. "It's completely absurd! But Mr Willy Wonka has done it!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然不可能！”约瑟夫爷爷叫道，“这简直是荒谬！但是威利·旺卡先生做到了！”">查看中文翻译</div>
