<div class="line_en">Stanley awoke in a meadow, looking up at the giant rock tower. It was layered and streaked with different shades of red, burnt orange, brown, and tan. It must have been over a hundred feet tall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利在草地上醒了过来，抬眼望着那块巍峨的石壁。石壁被垒成了深浅不一的各色条纹，有红色、橙色、棕褐色和棕黄色等，足有一百多英尺高。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stanley lay awhile, just looking at it. He didn't have the strength to get up. It felt like the insides of his mouth and throat were coated with sand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利躺了一会儿，望着石壁。他没有力气站起来。他觉得嘴里和喉咙里都蒙着一层沙土。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His hands and fingers were sore from digging, especially under his fingernails. He scooped some dirty water into his mouth, then swished it around, trying to filter it with his teeth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的双手和手指因为挖洞变得酸痛不堪，特别是指甲。他捧了点脏兮兮的水放到嘴里，漱了漱，指望着能靠牙齿过滤掉泥。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And no wonder. When he rolled over he saw the water hole. It was about two and a half feet deep and over three feet wide. At the bottom lay no more than two inches of very brown water.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这没什么好奇怪的。他翻过身，看到了那个水洞，约有两点五英尺深，三英尺多宽。洞底的水不超过两英寸，水是褐色的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Zero moaned.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="零蛋开始呻吟了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stanley started to say something to him, but no words came out of his mouth, and he had to try again. "How you doing?" It hurt to talk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利想对零蛋说一些话，但是他嘴里没有冒出一个字。他不得不又试了试。“你怎么样了？”说话的时候喉咙直犯疼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Not good," Zero said quietly. With great effort, he rolled over, raised himself to his knees, and crawled to the water hole. He lowered his head into it and lapped up some water.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不太好。”零蛋平静地说。他使劲翻过身，跪着直起身子，缓缓地爬到水洞边，低下头，舔了点水。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Stanley thought about going back down the mountain to look for the shovel, so he could make the water hole deeper. Maybe that would give them cleaner water. They could use the jars as drinking glasses.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利想要下山找回铲子，把洞挖得深一些。没准那样一来，就能挖出干净点的水。罐子正好可以用来当水杯。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He took a deep breath, then walked the last fifty yards to the giant precipice and touched it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他深深地吸了一口气，朝着那座石壁走出了最后五十码，摸到了它。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He struggled to his feet. He was in a field of greenish white flowers that seemed to extend all the way around Big Thumb.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他挣扎着站起来。面前是一片微微透着绿意的白色花海，沿着大拇指，一直向四面八方蔓延。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But he didn't think he had the strength to go down, let alone make it back up again. And he didn't know where to look.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是，他觉得自己已经没有气力下山了，更别说还得重新爬上来。况且，他也不知道去哪里找。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then he jerked back, clutched his knees to his chest, and rolled to his side. His body shook violently.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后，他猛地缩了回去，膝盖靠在胸膛上，蜷成一团，侧身翻倒在地上，身体剧烈地颤抖着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tag, you're it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="好，你做到了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He could see part of the trail he had made the night before, when he carried Zero up the mountain. If he was going to head back down and look for the shovel, he realized, he should do it soon, while the trail was fresh. But he didn't want to leave Zero. He was afraid Zero might die while he was gone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="前一天夜里留下的足迹依稀可见，那会儿他正扛着零蛋往山上爬。倘若真的打算下山找铲子，趁着痕迹还比较清晰的时候应该赶紧下山。但他不想把零蛋一个人扔在这里。他担心自己走掉之后，零蛋可能会死。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then he walked back to Zero and the water hole. On the way he picked one of the flowers. It actually wasn't one big flower, he discovered, but instead each flower was really a cluster of tiny little flowers that formed a round ball. He brought it to his mouth but had to spit it out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后，他又回到了零蛋和水洞那儿，半路上还摘了朵花。那种花并不大，但是每朵实际上都是由很多小花凑在一起形成的花球。他将花放进嘴里又吐出来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No, listen," Zero insisted, then he closed his eyes as his face twisted with pain.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他冲着月——月——月——亮叫喊，">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Zero closed his eyes. But then again he said, "I didn't know about the shoes."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="零蛋闭上眼睛，可是又接着说：“我不知道那双鞋的来历。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I didn't know," Zero said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我当时不知道。”零蛋说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Zero was still lying doubled over on his side. "I got to tell you something," he said with a groan.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="零蛋仍旧蜷着身子侧躺在地上。“我想跟你说件事。”他带着呻吟说道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That's okay," Stanley said. "Just rest."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好了，”斯坦利说，“好好休息。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It took a moment for Stanley to comprehend. "Clyde Livingston's shoes?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过了好一会儿斯坦利才明白过来。“克莱德·利文斯顿的鞋？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stanley didn't know what he was talking about. His shoes were on his feet. "That's all right," he said. "Just rest now."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利不明白零蛋指的是什么。他的鞋就穿在自己脚上。“好了，”他说，“休息会儿吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="然而大灰狼等在树下，饥肠辘辘，孤孤单单，">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Zero's "confession" seemed to bring him some relief. The muscles in his face relaxed. As he drifted into sleep, Stanley softly sang him the song that had been in his family for generations.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这番“忏悔”让零蛋心情放松了些，他脸上的肌肉也松弛了。当他逐渐睡去的时候，斯坦利轻轻地唱起了祖传的那首歌谣。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's all my fault," said Zero.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“都是我的错。”零蛋说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stanley stared at him. It was impossible. Zero was delirious.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯坦利盯着他。这不可能。零蛋肯定疯了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's nobody's fault," said Stanley.</div>
