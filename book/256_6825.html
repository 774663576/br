<div class="line_en">On reading over what I have written of the Stricklands, I am conscious that they must seem shadowy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="回过头来读了读我写的思特里克兰德夫妇的故事，我感到这两个人被我写得太没有血肉了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was just that shadowiness about them which you find in people whose lives are part of the social organism, so that they exist in it and by it only.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在他们身上，你发现了他们身上的阴暗，他们的生活是社会有机体的一部分，所以他们只存在于其中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I was torn between the fear of hurting a nice woman's feelings and the fear of being in the way.

I did not know what to do.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我既怕伤害这位夫人的感情，又怕去她家作客惹她心烦，心里非常矛盾。我知道她这时一定痛苦不堪，我不愿意看到别人受苦，自己无力替她分忧；但另一方面我又很想看一看思特里克兰德太太对这件事有何反应，尽管我对这个想法自己也觉得不好意思。我真不知道该怎么办好了。">查看中文翻译</div>
