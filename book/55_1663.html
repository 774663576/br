<div class="line_en">Ötzi the Iceman, as he is now called, became a celebrity. He appeared on the cover of Time magazine and has been the subject of many books, documentaries, and articles. Not since Mel Brooks's 2000 Year Old Man ("I have more than 42,000 children and not one comes to visit me") has a kilogenarian had so much to tell us about the past. Ötzi lived during the crucial transition in human prehistory when agriculture was replacing hunting and gathering, and tools were first made of metal rather than stone. Together with his ax and backpack, he carried a quiver of fletched arrows, a wood-handled dagger, and an ember wrapped in bark, part of an elaborate fire-starting kit. He wore a bearskin cap with a leather chinstrap, leggings sewn from animal hide, and waterproof snowshoes made from leather and twine and insulated with grass. He had tattoos on his arthritic joints, possibly a sign of acupuncture, and carried mushrooms with medicinal properties.</div>

<div class="line_en">In 1991 two hikers stumbled upon a corpse poking out of a melting glacier in the Tyrolean Alps. Thinking that it was the victim of a skiing accident, rescue workers jackhammered the body out of the ice, damaging his thigh and his backpack in the process. Only when an archaeologist spotted a Neolithic copper ax did people realize that the man was five thousand years old.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ötzi is not the only millennia-old man who became a scientific celebrity at the end of the 20th century. In 1996 spectators at a hydroplane race in Kennewick, Washington, noticed some bones poking out of a bank of the Columbia River. Archaeologists soon recovered the skeleton of a man who had lived 9,400 years ago. Kennewick Man quickly became the object of highly publicized legal and scientific battles. Several Native American tribes fought for custody of the skeleton and the right to bury it according to their traditions, but a federal court rejected their claims, noting that no human culture has ever been in continuous existence for nine millennia. When the scientific studies resumed, anthropologists were intrigued to learn that Kennewick Man was anatomically very different from today's Native Americans. One report argued that he had European features; another that he matched the Ainu, the aboriginal inhabitants of Japan. Either possibility would imply that the Americas had been peopled by several independent migrations, contradicting DNA evidence suggesting that Native Americans are descendants of a single group of migrants from Siberia.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到20世纪末，奥茨不再是唯一一个成为科学明星的千年老人。1996年，在华盛顿州的肯纳威克，一场水上飞机竞赛的观众注意到哥伦比亚河岸边有暴露的骨头。考古学家很快找到了一具生活在9400年前的男性骨架。“肯纳威克人”立刻成为法律纠纷和科学争议的目标，受到媒体的高度关注。几个印第安人部落互相抢夺对这具骨架的监护权，并力争要按照传统掩埋骨架。但是，一所联邦法院拒绝了他们的要求，法庭表示，人类还没有任何文化能够连续存在9000年。重新开启对这具骨骼的科学研究后，考古学家们对自己的新发现颇为激动——在人体解剖学上，“肯纳威克人”和今天的美洲土著非常不同。一项报告坚持说此人有欧洲人的特征，另一项报告说他和阿伊努人，即日本的原住民相吻合。两种可能性都意味着美洲曾经有几支独立的外来移民，而DNA证据表明今天的美洲土著都是一支来自西伯利亚的移民的后裔。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ten years after the Iceman was discovered, a team of radiologists made a startling discovery: Ötzi had an arrowhead embedded in his shoulder. He had not fallen in a crevasse and frozen to death, as scientists had originally surmised; he had been murdered. As his body was examined by the the CSI Neolithic team, the outlines of the crime came into view. Ötzi had unhealed cuts on his hands and wounds on his head and chest. DNA analyses found traces of blood from two other people on one of his arrowheads, blood from a third on his dagger, and blood from a fourth on his cape. According to one reconstruction, Ötzi belonged to a raiding party that clashed with a neighboring tribe. He killed a man with an arrow, retrieved it, killed another man, retrieved the arrow again, and carried a wounded comrade on his back before fending off an attack and being felled by an arrow himself.</div>

<div class="line_en">These are just two examples of famous prehistoric remains that have yielded grisly news about how their owners met their ends. Many visitors to the British Museum have been captivated by Lindow Man, an almost perfectly preserved two-thousand-year-old body discovered in an English peat bog in 1984. We don't know how many of his children visited him, but we do know how he died. His skull had been fractured with a blunt object; his neck had been broken by a twisted cord; and for good measure his throat had been cut. Lindow Man may have been a Druid who was ritually sacrificed in three ways to satisfy three gods. Many other bog men and women from northern Europe show signs of having been strangled, bludgeoned, stabbed, or tortured.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们只有两具史前人类的遗骨，而他们生命的结束方式，都是非常可怕的。大英博物馆的很多参观者都被“林多人”所吸引。这是一具保存完好、有2000年历史的古尸，1984年在英国的泥炭沼泽地被发现。我们不知道有多少他的孩子来探望过他，但我们知道他是怎样死亡的。他的头盖骨被钝器击裂，他的颈骨被扭紧的绳子勒断，不仅如此，他的喉咙还被割开了。“林多人”可能是一个德鲁伊，被以三种方式牺牲，献祭给三位神。北欧泥炭沼泽保留下来的男女尸体都带有被勒死、被重器击打、被刀扎或者遭受酷刑的痕迹。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For plenty of reasons, then, Kennewick Man has become an object of fascination among the scientifically curious. And here is one more. Lodged in Kennewick Man's pelvis is a stone projectile.

<div class="line_en">In a single month while researching this book, I came across two new stories about remarkably preserved human remains. One is a two-thousand-year-old skull dug out of a muddy pit in northern England. The archaeologist who was cleaning the skull felt something move, looked through the opening at the base, and saw a yellow substance inside, which turned out to be a preserved brain. Once again, the unusual state of preservation was not the only noteworthy feature about the find. The skull had been deliberately severed from the body, suggesting to the archaeologist that it was a victim of human sacrifice. The other discovery was of a 4,600-year-old grave in Germany that held the remains of a man, a woman, and two boys. DNA analyses showed that they were members of a single nuclear family, the oldest known to science. The foursome had been buried at the same time -- signs, the archaeologists said, that they had been killed in a raid.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在为此书做研究的一个月时间里，我检索到两个保存特别完好的人类尸体的故事。一个是在英格兰北部的泥沼中挖出的一副2000年前的头骨。当考古学家清理骷髅的时候，感觉到里面有东西在滑动，从骷髅底部的敞口处向里窥测，看到一种黄色的物质，它竟然是风干了的人脑。和以往一样，尸身保留异常完好的程度并非值得我们关注的唯一要点。这具头骨是很精心地从身体上切割下来的，这告诉考古学家，这是一位活人献祭的受害者。另一个故事是德国的一处有4600年历史的老坟墓，埋葬着一位男子、一位女子和两个男孩的尸体。DNA检测证明他们是一个核心家庭的成员，这应当是科学家所知道的最早的核心家庭。这四位死者是同时下葬的。考古学家认为，这表明他们是在一场袭击中被同时杀害的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What is it about the ancients that they couldn't leave us an interesting corpse without resorting to foul play? Some cases may have an innocent explanation based in taphonomy, the processes by which bodies are preserved over long spans of time. Perhaps at the turn of the first millennium the only bodies that got dumped into bogs, there to be pickled for posterity, were those that had been ritually sacrificed. But with most of the bodies, we have no reason to think that they were preserved only because they had been murdered. Later we will look at the results of forensic investigations that can distinguish how an ancient body met its end from how it came down to us. For now, prehistoric remains convey the distinct impression that The Past is a place where a person had a high chance of coming to bodily harm.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="难道说，古人们不进行谋杀，就不能给后人留下些有趣的尸骨了吗？根据丧葬学理，有些案例可以有合理的解释，因为只有经过处理的尸体才能够长久地保存。也许，在人类的第一个千禧年开始的时候，只有那些作为献祭品牺牲者的尸体才会被扔进泥沼，因此得以为后代保存下来。但是，我们还是没有理由认为，古人们保存这些人的尸体，仅仅因为他们是被谋杀的。下面，我们要从法医的鉴定结果来看看古代尸体的死亡原因，它又是怎样落到我们的手里。至少，史前的遗骨给我们留下的明确印象是，在“往昔”这个地方，人的身体极有可能受到伤害。">查看中文翻译</div>
