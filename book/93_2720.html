<div class="line_en">Morris, that's my husband's nickname, said I was a fanatic about my tree. I couldn't help it. It was just my way. It was a lovely tree, from the angel on top to the miniature manger my great grandfather made underneath. Grandma told us he carved it the first year they were married. She loved telling stories of knitting scarves and mittens for presents. They lived on the plains in a small clay and lumber house for their first four years.</div>

<div class="line_en">The fresh green smell of Christmas filled the house and the sight of the tree took your breath away. Striped candy canes were evenly distributed and colorful paper chains, swans, lambs, donkeys and horses draped aesthetically on the branches to compliment the red and gold bulbs. The white silvery winged angel stood at the very top watching over the entire tree. I also placed a cassette player for sortie Christmas songs. It was a beautiful tree; and I knew it deserved a good feedback.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="圣诞节清新的绿色气息充满了整个房间，看到圣诞树让你屏住呼吸。条纹的拐杖糖均匀地分布着，五颜六色的纸链，天鹅、羊羔、驴和马在树枝上悬挂着，美观地衬托着红色和金色的灯泡。那个白色的、带着银色翅膀的天使站在最高处，看着整棵树。我还放置了一个卡式录音机来放圣诞歌曲。这是一棵美丽的树，我知道它值得好好反馈。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Laura and I were children, story telling became an integral part of the family's tradition. It was the climax of every night. We put the manger under the tree when the decoration was done and waited for Christmas Eve when Papa read the Bible stories. Only then were we ready to put the Baby in the manger.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当劳拉和我还是孩子的时候，讲故事成了家庭传统中不可或缺的一部分。这是每个夜晚的高潮。装饰完毕后，我们把马槽放在圣诞树下，等待平安夜爸爸读圣经故事。直到那时我们才准备好把婴儿放进马槽。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Cut it out, Cora, you'll make yourself crazy. It's a very nice tree, really. Come on look, it's snowing,"his words led me to the opaque bay through the window.

<div class="line_cn" title="“别闹了，柯拉，你会把自己弄疯的。这棵树真的很漂亮。快来看，下雪了。”他的话引导我穿过窗户来到那个不透明的海湾。我在丈夫旁边的沙发上坐下，拿起《电视指南》。正当莫里斯按“ON”键去看篮球比赛时，门铃响了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No, honey, this is someone else's grandma."The young mother's white wool stole slipped from her dark hair. She bound the baby in 3 blue blanket and maybe it was the Light's flare reflecting from the ceiling's dome in the hall or maybe it was the special night, but just at that moment she looked like the Madonna. Her big brown eyes were filled with tenderness as she touched the baby. I felt what she felt. I am a mother myself, you know. She smiled at me, like the smile of an innocent angel, without any impurity.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，亲爱的，这是别人的奶奶。”年轻母亲的白色羊毛披肩从她黑色的头发上滑落下来。她把婴儿裹在3条蓝色的毯子里，也许是大厅天花板穹顶反射出的光芒，也许是那个特别的夜晚，但就在那一刻，她看起来就像圣母玛利亚。她抚摸着婴儿，棕色的大眼睛里充满了柔情。我感受到了她的感受。你知道，我自己也是个母亲。她对我微笑，像一个天真无邪的天使，没有任何杂质。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As they drove out of sight Morris and I came back into the warm room. The Bible was on the coffee table where Morris pm it after he had read to me earlier. The draft from the door turned the fine Bible pages. We sat down and glanced at the holy book. "Anyone who takes care of a little child like this is caring for me!" I leaned back into my husband's arms and looked at my Christmas tree.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他们开车离开我们的视线时，我和莫里斯回到了温暖的房间。圣经就放在咖啡桌上，莫里斯先前给我读完圣经后，就把它放在了那里。从门口拿出的稿子翻动着精美的《圣经》。我们坐下来，扫了一眼圣经。“任何照顾这样一个小孩的人都是在照顾我！”我向后靠在丈夫的怀里，看着我的圣诞树。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They all bundled into their warm clothing and Maryann kissed us goodbye. The baby had been sleeping most of the time when they were in our house. When she put his blankets around him, she handed him to me. She put the white stole back on her black hair and I looked at the baby. He opened his eyes and I knew he was too young to smile, but I told you -- he did. I would never forget the look on that infant face. Maybe it was the special night or, as I said, maybe the hall light cast a reflection, but in the blanket around the baby's head, brightness glowed. They started out the door. "Wait!"I yelled. I put the carved infant Jesus into David's hand. "I will never forget you."I said."Nor we VOU."said the father."or your kindness to strangers."</div>
