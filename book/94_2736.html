<div class="line_en">But Dad isn't Granny, so he just nods tentatively and asks her to be good enough to put on her seat belt. He does that very often. Nods tentatively. Dad is a tentative person. Mum is a perfectionist and Dad is a pedant and that was partly why their marriage didn't work so well, Elsa figures. Because a perfectionist and a pedant are two very different things. When Mum and Dad did the cleaning, Mum wrote a minute-by-minute breakdown of the cleaning schedule, but then Dad would sort of get caught up with descaling the coffee percolator for two and a half hours, and you really can't plan a life with a person like that around you, said Mum. The teachers at school always tell Elsa that her problem is her inability to concentrate, which is very odd, Elsa thinks, because Dad's big problem is that he can't stop concentrating.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，爸爸不是外婆，所以他犹豫地点了点头，叫她听话系好安全带。他经常这样，犹豫地点头。爸爸是个优柔寡断的人。妈妈是个完美主义者，而爸爸是个书呆子，这也是他们的婚姻行不通的一个原因。完美主义者和书呆子是截然不同的两种生物。就打扫卫生这件事，妈妈会写下一份精确到分钟的打扫计划表，但爸爸却会被给咖啡壶除垢之类的事情缠住两个半小时。妈妈说，身边有这样的人，很难制定人生规划。学校的老师总是告诉爱莎，她的问题是注意力难以集中，爱莎觉得这很奇怪，因为爸爸最大的问题就是集中得停不下来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He often does that. Asks what Elsa would like to do. Because he very rarely wants to do anything himself. And this Tuesday was very unexpected for him: Dad is not very good at dealing with unexpected Tuesdays. That's why Elsa only stays every other weekend with him, because after he met Lisette and she and her children moved in, Dad said it was too "messy" for Elsa there. When Granny found out, she phoned him and called him a Nazi at least ten times in a minute. That was a Nazi record, even for Granny. And when she'd hung up she turned to Elsa and spluttered, "Lisette? What sort of name is that?" And Elsa knew she didn't really mean it, of course, because everyone likes Lisette -- she has the same superpower as George. But Granny was the sort of person you brought with you when you went to war, and that was what Elsa loved about her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他总是这样，问爱莎想做什么。因为他自己很少主动想做什么事情。这个周二对他来说是意料之外的，爸爸很不擅长应对意料之外的周二。爱莎每两周才会跟他过个周末，因为自从他遇见莉丝特，并且她的孩子们搬过来之后，爸爸就说他家对爱莎而言太“复杂”了。外婆知道情况后，给爸爸打了个电话，在一分钟之内起码骂了他十遍“纳粹”。即使对外婆而言，这个使用次数也是够多的。挂掉电话之后，她激动地对爱莎说：“莉丝特？这算什么鬼名字？”爱莎知道外婆这么说并不是真心的，每个人都喜欢莉丝特——她也有乔治那种超能力。但外婆是爱莎的坚定同盟，爱莎爱她这一点。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dad likes to know what he's getting. One time last year they rearranged the shelves in the supermarket near where Dad and Lisette live, and Elsa had to run those tests she had seen advertised on the television, to make sure he hadn't had a stroke.</div>

<div class="line_en">Once they get home, Dad gets out of Audi and goes with her to the entrance. Britt-Marie is on the other side of the door, hunched up like a livid little house pixie on guard. It occurs to Elsa that you always know no good can come from catching sight of Britt-Marie. "She's like a letter from the tax authorities, that old biddy," Granny used to say. Dad seems to agree -- Britt-Marie is one of the few subjects on which he and Granny were in agreement. She's holding a crossword magazine in her hand. Britt-Marie likes crosswords very much because there are very clear rules about how to do them. She only ever does them in pencil, though -- Granny always said Britt-Marie was the sort of woman who would have to drink two glasses of wine and feel really wild and crazy to be able to fantasize about solving a crossword in ink.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到家时，爸爸从奥迪上下来陪爱莎走到大门入口。布里特—玛丽在门的另一侧探出头，像一只恼怒的家养小精灵。爱莎突然想到，看见布里特—玛丽就意味着没什么好事。“她就像税务局的来信，那个老太婆。”外婆以前常常说。爸爸貌似也同意，这是他和外婆少数能达成一致的观点。她手上拿着一份填字杂志。她很喜欢这个游戏，因为规则明确。她只用铅笔填，外婆总说，布里特—玛丽这种女人，必须喝上两杯红酒让自己感到狂野才能去幻想一下用墨水解决填字游戏。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She pats the glove compartment of Audi, as if it were a cat. New cars smell of soft leather, the polar opposite of the smell of old split leather in Granny's flat. Elsa likes both smells, though she prefers living animals to dead ones that have been made into car seats. "You know what you're getting with an Audi," Dad says, nodding. His last car was also called Audi.</div>

Dad looked very doubtful about it when he found out. It took him three weeks to decide what sort of font the posters should have.

The song the drunk always sings. Elsa sits in the darkness on the stairs and hugs herself, as if it is a lullaby just for her. And then even that falls silent. She hears the drunk trying to calm down the shoehorn, before disappearing into her flat again. Elsa half-closes her eyes.
