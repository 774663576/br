<div class="line_en">As Ella watched, the beggar woman lifted her walking stick into the air. It suddenly transformed from an old gnarled piece of wood into a thin silver wand. Then she began to wave the wand, causing a coil of silver glitter to descend over her head. When the glitter cleared, the beggar woman was gone, and in her place was a beautiful woman with light hair that hung about her face in tight curls.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="瑞拉看着乞丐婆婆把拐杖举到空中。突然，这根粗糙的木棍变成了一根细细的银魔杖。老婆婆挥舞着魔杖，一个耀眼的银色的光环降落到她的头上方。光环消失的时候，乞丐婆婆不见了，她刚才站的地方出现了一个长着浅色卷发的漂亮女人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The dark tattered cloak she had worn had been replaced with a white gown that sparkled in the moonlight. (Truly a spectacular transformation, if I do say so myself!

<div class="line_cn" title="瑞拉跟着仙女教母走来走去。“那个浴缸？”她指着一个带脚的旧浴缸建议道，那浴缸现在被用来喂鸟。仙女教母摇了摇头。“那个木桶？”仙女教母又摇了摇头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Perhaps we should begin with the carriage," the Fairy Godmother was saying. "To be honest, I hadn't really thought about it, although I can't imagine why not. Let's see…" Spinning around, she looked over the garden. In the center, the fountain gurgled, while a greenhouse stood nearby, the strong smell of earth and flowers coming from inside. "What we need is something that sort of says 'coach.'"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“也许我们该从马车开始。”仙女教母说，“说实话，我还没考虑过，虽然我不知道为什么没想过。让我想想…”她转来转去，看着花园。花园的中间，喷泉在汩汩流淌，旁边是一个温室，里面传来土地和鲜花浓浓的香味。“我们需要的是一种大概叫作‘四轮马车’的东西。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Let me see," her fairy godmother said, racking her brain. "What about a pumpkin?" she finally suggested.</div>

<div class="line_en">Clapping her hands in delight, Ella's fairy godmother began to inspect the pumpkins one by one. Several were far too small, others not quite ripe. Finally, she found one that seemed perfect. She tried to pick it up. But it was a rather large pumpkin and it didn't budge. "Never mind. We'll do it here."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="仙女教母高兴地拍着手，开始一个一个地查看这些南瓜。有几个太小了，还有一些不熟。终于，她找到一个看似非常完美的南瓜。她想把它拿起来。但是南瓜太大了，竟然一点儿都搬不动。“没关系，就在这里吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Do what here?" Ella asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“在这里干什么？”瑞拉问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh," Ella replied, as though this were something that happened to her all the time. She looked at the pumpkin and waited for the magical transformation. And then she waited some more. Finally, she snuck a glance at her fairy godmother. The woman's eyes were closed in concentration. Feeling Ella's gaze upon her, she opened one eye.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，”瑞拉回答道，仿佛成天看到这种事一样。她盯着南瓜，等待着神奇的变化。她又等了一会儿。终于，她忍不住偷偷地看了仙女教母一眼。仙女教母那时正全神贯注地闭着眼睛。她感到瑞拉在看着自己，便睁开了一只眼睛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It might be better…" her fairy godmother began. But then she shook her head. "Oh, for heaven's sake. Let's just have a go." Pointing her wand at the pumpkin, she mumbled a few words, and a cloud of stardust blew out over the pumpkin. Then, as Ella watched in amazement, the pumpkin began to grow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那样可能会好一点…”仙女教母说。不过她又摇摇头：“哦，看在老天的分上，我们先试一下。”她用魔杖指着南瓜，念念有词地说了几句话，南瓜便发出一片神奇的光芒。接着，瑞拉惊奇地看着南瓜开始变大。">查看中文翻译</div>

Fragments of the broken greenhouse became its windows, the sides grew ornate decorations, and on top of the carriage, the pumpkin's stem became an immaculate roof.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="瑞拉看到眼前的南瓜又开始变化，忍不住吸了一口气。这次，它变成一辆她见过的最漂亮的马车。温室的碎片变成了它的窗户，四周的墙变成了美丽的装饰，马车顶上，南瓜的茎变成了完美无瑕的车顶。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"They can talk?" Ella asked, the night growing stranger still. True, her mother had told her animals could talk and listen. And true, she had spent many a lonely night telling the mice of her dreams and hardships, but she hadn't really thought they could understand her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“它们会说话？”瑞拉问道，这个夜晚变得更加不可思议。尽管，母亲告诉过她动物会说话，也会倾听。尽管，在无数个孤独的夜晚，她向老鼠们倾诉过自己的梦想和艰难，但是她从没想到它们真的可以听懂。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, certainly," her fairy godmother replied. "And they are very good listeners, too. They have told me all about you." Then, focusing her attention, she lifted her wand. In one smooth motion, she passed it over the family of mice.</div>

When that was finished, the Fairy Godmother clapped her hands together. "Now, everyone into place. There's no time to be lost."

<div class="line_en">True to her word, Ella's fairy godmother had kept elements of her mother's dress but enhanced it. The color had changed from soft pink to sky blue. The skirt filled out and now swirled around her as she moved, and the sleeves fell slightly off her shoulders, decorated with delicate butterflies. With another wave of the wand, fireflies descended and settled into Ella's hair, around her neck, and on her ears.

<div class="line_en">Her fairy godmother nodded. "Now, I really must insist you go and quickly…" Her voice trailed off as she saw a look of worry cross over Ella's face. "What is it now?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="仙女教母点点头：“好了，现在得走了，快…”当她看到瑞拉脸上的那一丝忧虑后，她的声音顿住了：“又怎么了？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">(In all the years before and all the years since, I have never crafted something quite as special as those shoes. Given the important role they played later, I'm rather glad I did. But I am getting ahead of myself. You will see just how important they were very soon.)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="（在那之前的好多年，以及以后的好多年，我都从来没做过那么特殊的鞋子。想到后来这双鞋起到的作用，我很高兴我那么做了。我好像有点透露后面发生的事情了。您很快就会发现这双鞋有多么重要。）">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You'll be surprised how comfortable they are," her fairy godmother commented.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“它们舒服得让你吃惊。”仙女教母说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Gingerly, Ella slipped first one foot, then the other into her new shoes. They fit like gloves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="瑞拉小心翼翼地先穿上一只水晶鞋，又穿上另一只。它们非常合脚。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her fairy godmother smiled. "I can't think why," she said. "You're invited as much as they are. But never fear. Remember, there's none so blind as those who will not see."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="仙女教母笑着说：“怎么会呢？你和她们一样，是受到邀请的。但是千万别害怕。记住，视而不见的人才是真正的瞎子。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"My stepmother and the girls," she said softly. "Won't they humiliate me and have me thrown out if they can?" Up until that moment, she had been too caught up in the magic of it all to think about it. But she knew her stepfamily all too well. They would never stand her presence at the ball.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我继母和姐姐们，”瑞拉低声说，“她们会不会羞辱我，再让人把我扔出来？”刚才她一直陶醉在仙女教母的魔法里，没顾上考虑这个问题。但是她太了解继母她们了。她们不会容忍瑞拉出现在舞会上的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ella nodded, reassured. As she took a seat on the comfortable bench inside the carriage, her fairy godmother peered through the window. "Ella, remember this: the magic will only last so long. With the echo of the last bell at the last stroke of midnight, the spell will be broken -- and all will be as it was before."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="瑞拉放心地点点头。瑞拉坐在马车里舒服的座位上，仙女教母从车窗外看过来。“瑞拉，记住：魔法不会持续太长时间。午夜最后一次钟响敲击的回声消失时，魔法就会消失——一切都会恢复原样。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I mean I will make sure they don't know you, which I think I can do."</div>

<div class="line_en">Ella cocked her head. "You mean they won't believe it's me, dressed as I am?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="瑞拉抬起头问：“你是说因为我穿成这样，她们不会相信是我吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Midnight?" Ella smiled. Just moments earlier, she'd thought she wouldn't be going to the ball at all. "That will be more than enough time!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“午夜？”瑞拉笑了。就在刚才，她还以为自己根本去不了舞会呢。“时间已经足够了！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As the horses' hooves clopped on the road, Ella looked out at the passing countryside. A full moon hung high in the sky, its light illuminating the roofs of houses and turning the green grasses silver. At that moment, Ella felt as if she were someone else. Someone who had never known sadness and loss. Someone who had always loved and been loved in return. At that moment, she felt like anything was possible.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伴随着马蹄的得得声，瑞拉看着车窗外乡村的景色。一轮满月挂在天上，月光照亮了屋顶，让绿色的草地也变成了银色。那一刻，瑞拉觉得自己仿佛变成另一个人：一个从来不知道悲伤和失落的人；一个充满了爱，也备受爱护的人。那一刻，她觉得一切都是可能的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Without further ado, the coachman gave the signal and they were off. Ella took a deep breath and leaned back. The carriage was the most elegant one she had ever been in, every inch designed to sparkle and enchant.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="瑞拉说完，马车夫做了个手势，他们就出发了。瑞拉深吸了一口气，靠在座位上。这是她坐过的最精美的马车，每个细节都是那么闪耀迷人。">查看中文翻译</div>
