<div class="line_en">Two-thirds of the way down the Faubourg Saint-Honoré, behind a magnificent private mansion (remarkable even among the many remarkable residences in this rich district), there is a huge garden surrounded by walls as high as ramparts. From here, in springtime, the tufted chestnuts drop their pink-and-white flowers into two fluted stone vases, placed opposite one another on two quadrangular pilasters, between which is set an iron gateway from the time of Louis XIII.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="圣·奥诺路是有钱人的住宅区，各式各样的巨邸都以设计的高雅和建筑的华丽相竞争，靠近这条路的中段，在一座最富丽堂皇的大厦的背后，有一座很大的花园，园里遍栽栗子树，树头昂然俯视着那象城堡似的又高又结实的围墙。每年春天，粉红和雪白的栗花纷纷飘坠，于是，在那路易十三时代筑成的铁门。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Despite the splendid geraniums growing in the two vases which tossed their marbled leaves and purple flowers in the wind, this grandiose entrance had been condemned since the time -- and it was some time earlier -- when the owners of the mansion confined themselves to possession of the house itself, the tree-lined courtyard opening into the Faubourg and the garden behind the gateway we have mentioned, which formerly gave access to a magnificent vegetable garden, an acre in size, adjoining the property. But the demon of speculation drew a line, in the form of a street, along the side of the vegetable garden; the street, before it even existed except as a line, received a name, thanks to a polished-iron plaque; and someone had the idea that the vegetable garden could be sold for buildings along the street, to compete with the major Parisian thoroughfare called the Faubourg Saint-Honoré.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两旁方柱顶上的大石花盆里，就堆满了这些娇柔的花瓣。这个高贵的进口虽然外观很壮丽，虽然种植在那两只石花盆里的（牛龙）牛花很绰约多姿：杂色斑驳的叶片随风摇曳，深红色的花朵赏心悦目，但是，自从这座大厦的业主搬进来以后（那已是许多年以前的事了），却已绝对废弃不用。大厦的正门向圣·奥诺路，前面有一个种满花草的庭园，后面就是关闭在这扇铁门里的花园。这扇门以前原和一个肥沃的果园相通，果园的面积约有一亩左右，但投机鬼却在这个果园的尽头划了一条线——就是说，修筑了一条街道——而这条街道甚至在还没有完工以前就已经给取了名，果园的主人原想使这条街道和那条称为圣·奥诺路的巴黎大动脉连接起来，这样就可以把果园当作可以建筑房屋的沿街地皮出卖。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">However, as we said, the garden gate, which used at one time to look over the vegetable garden, has been condemned and rust is eating into its hinges. Worse still: so that the low-born market gardeners shall not sully the interior of the aristocratic property with their vulgar gaze, a wall of planks has been affixed to the bars of the gate up to a height of six feet. Admittedly these planks are not so tightly juxtaposed as to prevent a furtive glance slipping between them; but the house is a forbidding house and not afraid of indiscreet eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因此，正如刚才已经说过了的，这扇通果园的铁门已封闭了起来，任其生锈腐蚀，而的确要不了多久铁锈就会把门上的铰链烂断，同时，为了防止果园里的掘土工人擅自窥视大厦，玷污贵族的庭园，铁门上又钉了六呎高的木板。不错，木板钉得并不十分密，从板缝里仍旧可以偷看到园内的景色，但那座房子里的家风极其严肃，是不怕轻狂之徒作好奇的窥视的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">However, where speculation is concerned, man proposes and money disposes. The street was baptized and died in its cradle. The purchaser of the vegetable garden, having paid the full amount for it, could not resell at the price he wanted; so, while waiting for a rise in prices that was bound, sooner or later, to more than compensate him for past losses and the capital which he had tied up, he made do with renting the plot to some market gardeners for the sum of five hundred francs a year. This was money invested at half a per cent, which is not much nowadays when so many people invest it at fifty and still complain that the returns are poor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是，在投机事业上，真所谓谋事在人，成事在钱。这条被定了新名字的街道始终没修完，果园的购买者本钱付了不少，可是除非他甘心蚀大本，否则无法找到一个愿意来接手这笔买卖的人。但他相信将来有一天总可以卖到一笔大数目，非但可以偿清他过去所支出的费用，而且可以捞回那笔困死在这项投资上的资金的利息，所以他只得以年租五百法郎的价钱，把这块地方暂时租给一个果贩子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On the side nearest to the mansion, the chestnut-trees which we mentioned crown the wall, though this does not prevent other luxuriantly flowering rivals from insinuating their branches between them in search of air. At a corner where the growth is so thick that the light can hardly penetrate, a wide stone bench and some garden seats mark a meeting place or favourite retreat of an inhabitant of the large house, which can hardly be seen through the protective wall of greenery around this spot, even though it is only a hundred yards away. Apart from that, the position of this mysterious shelter could have been dictated by: the absence of sun, giving a permanent chill to the air, on even the hottest summer days; the singing of the birds; and the distance from the house and from the street, that is to say from bustle and noise.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在大厦那方面，我们前面已经提到过，栗子树高高地耸立着，长得比围墙还高，其他的花木也欣欣向荣地生长着，并不受栗子树的影响，它们热心地向四面八方蔓延，填满了园中的空地，象在坚持它们也有权享受光线和空气似的。花园的有一个角落枝叶极其繁密，几乎把日光都关闭在外面，这儿有一条大石凳和各色各样农家风味的坐具，表示这个隐秘的去处是一个聚会的地点，或是这大厦里某一位主人翁所心爱的静居处，大厦离这儿虽只有一百步左右，但从繁密的绿叶丛中望出去，却只能看到一个极模糊的影子。总之，选择这个神秘的地点来作静居处是极有道理的，因为这儿可以逃避一切窥视的目光，有凉快爽神的树荫，繁密的枝叶象是一重天幕。即使在最炎热的夏季，遇到那火烧一般的日子，灼人的阳光也找不到一丝进道，鸟儿在宛转地歌唱，街上和大厦里的喧嚣声都达不到这儿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the vegetable garden, instead of cabbages, carrots, radish, peas and melons, the only growing things to show that this otherwise abandoned site is still sometimes tended are tall alfalfa plants. A low door, opening on the proposed line of the street, allows entry to the place, which is surrounded by walls. The tenants have, in the past week, abandoned it because of its barrenness, and now, instead of the previous half a percent, it is bringing in no per cent at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这个果园里，以前曾一度繁殖过最精美的果蔬，现在却只疏疏朗朗地种植着一些苜蓿花，由于无人照料，将来，恐不免要成一块贫瘠的空地。它和那条计划中的街道有一扇矮矮的小门相通，开门进来，便是这块篱笆围住的荒地，但虽然是荒地，在一星期以前，业主却从它身上得回了千分之五的老本，而以前它是一个钱都不赚的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On the evening of one of the warmest days that Paris had so far enjoyed that spring, the stone bench carried a book, a sunshade, a work basket and a lawn handkerchief, partly embroidered. Not far from the bench, beside the gate, looking through a gap in the planks, was a young woman whose attention was directed towards the deserted vegetable garden which we have just described.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="春之女神最近赐了一些最温暖的日子给巴黎的居民。这一天傍晚，石凳上可以看见随随便便地抛着一本书，一顶阳伞和一只绣花篮子，篮子里拖出一块未完工的绣花麻纱手帕。离这几件东西不远的地方，有一个青年女郎站在铁门旁边，竭力从板缝中向外面望，她的态度极其热切，眼睛一眨都不眨，这可以证明她对于这件事是感到多么的关切。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Almost at the same moment as she was looking out across it, the little doorway into the site closed silently and a young man came through it, tall, energetic, wearing an undyed cotton smock and corduroy cap -- though his well-tended moustache, beard and black hair did not harmonize with this lower-class attire. He looked quickly around to ensure that he was not being watched, came through the door, closed it behind him and strode rapidly towards the iron gate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正当那时，果园通街道的那扇门无声地打开了，进来的是一个高大强壮的青年人，身上穿着一套普通的灰色工人装，戴着一顶丝绒的鸭舌帽，但他的头发，胡子和髭须却梳理得极其工整，漆黑光亮，和他身上这种平民式的打扮颇不相称。他把门打开以后，迅速地向四周环顾了一眼，发觉并没有人看到他，就走进来，又小心地把门关上，以匆促的步伐向铁门走过来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Seeing the man she was expecting, if not necessarily in that dress, the young woman was taken aback and started. But the man, with a sharpness of perception that belongs only to a lover, had already seen, through the gaps in the planks, the fluttering of her white dress and long blue belt. He ran across to the gate and, pressing his lips against the opening, said: "Don't worry, Valentine. It's me!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="青年女郎虽然见到了她所期待的人，但看到服装不对，就不禁大吃一惊，急忙要抽身退回。但那个眼睛里燃烧着爱情的青年却已经从门的缺口里看到了白衣服的动作，又看到了他那位美丽的邻居的细腰上的那条蓝色的腰带的飘动。他急忙跳过来，把他的嘴巴贴在一个缺口上，喊道：“别怕，凡兰蒂，是我！”">查看中文翻译</div>

Now, let me thank you for your scolding; it charms me, because it proves that… I dare not say that you were waiting for me, but at least that you thought of me.

Apart from which, I feared people might find it odd for a captain in the spahis to be constantly hovering around this plot of land, where there is not a single fortress to attack or blockhouse to defend; so I have become a market gardener and put on the clothing of my profession."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“上苍别让我跟那比我自己的生命更宝贵的人开玩笑！但听我说，凡兰蒂，我把这件事详详细细地来告诉你。我对于量地皮和爬墙壁实在有点厌倦了，而且你又告诉我，要是你爹爹看到我在这儿徘徊，很可能把我当作一名小偷关到牢里去，所以我很担心，因为那会把法国全体陆军的名誉都玷污了的，同时，要是旁人看到一位驻阿尔及利亚的骑兵上尉老是在这既无城堡需要围攻又无要塞须得保卫的地点蹓跶，那又会引起多大的惊奇——所以我已变成了一个菜贩子，并且穿上了我这一行职业的服装。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, I went to find the owner of this plot of land and, since the lease with the old tenants had run out, I took it over from him myself. All this alfalfa that you see is mine, Valentine. Nothing prevents me from building a cabin in the stubble and from henceforth living twenty yards away from you. Oh, happiness and joy -- I can hardly contain myself. Do you think that those two things can be bought, Valentine? Impossible, isn't it? Well, all this happiness and joy, for which I would have given ten years of my life, are costing me… guess how much? Five hundred francs a year, in quarterly instalments. You see, from now on we have nothing to fear. I am at home here. I can put a ladder against my wall and look over it. I am entitled to tell you that I love you, without fearing that the night watch will disturb me, provided your pride is not wounded at hearing this word on the lips of a poor day-labourer dressed in a smock and wearing a cap."</div>

Was it not my happiness that gave you confidence in me? When you told me that some vague instinct had convinced you that you were running a great danger, I devoted myself to serving you, and asked for no reward save the happiness of being able to do so. Since that time, have I given any indication that would make you repent of having chosen me from among all those who would have been happy to die for you? Poor child, you told me that you were engaged to Monsieur d'Epinay, that your father had decided that this match would take place and that, consequently, it was certain to do so, since everything that Monsieur de Villefort wants is bound to happen. Well, I stayed in the background, not expecting anything from my own will or yours, but everything from events and from Providence; and yet you love me, you took pity on me, Valentine, and you told me so.

They say that Monsieur Franz d'Epinay will be away for another year yet. What good fortune might not befall us in a year, what favourable turn might events not take! So let us hope, because it is so good and so sweet to hope. Meanwhile you, Valentine, you who accuse me of egoism, how have you behaved towards me? Like the beautiful and cold statue of some prudish Venus. In exchange for my devotion, my obedience and my restraint, what have you promised me? Nothing. What have you given me? Very little. You talk to me of Monsieur d'Epinay, your fiancé, and you sigh at the thought that you might one day belong to him. Come, Valentine, is that the only idea on your mind? What! I offer you my life, I give you my soul, I dedicate the slightest beat of my heart to you; and, while I am all yours, while I whisper to myself that I should die if I were to lose you, you, on your side, are not appalled at the very idea of belonging to another man! Oh, Valentine, Valentine! If I was what you are, if I felt myself to be loved as you may be sure that I love you, I should already have put my hand a hundred times through the bars of this gate and grasped poor Maximilien's, saying: 'Yours, yours alone, Maximilien, in this world and in the next.'"</div>
