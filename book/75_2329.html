<div class="line_en">The Palazzo Falconieri stands on a promontory on one of the smaller Italian lakes. It's late June, and a faint breeze touches the pines and cypresses that cluster like sentinels around the rocky headland. The gardens are imposing, and perhaps even beautiful, but the deep shadows lend the place a forbidding air, which is echoed by the severe lines of the Palazzo itself.</div>

<div class="line_en">The building faces the lake, and is fronted by tall windows through which silk curtains are visible.

<div class="line_en">At first glance the twelve men sitting around the table look ordinary enough. Successful, judging from their quietly expensive clothes.

<div class="line_en">The morning passes in discussion, which is conducted in Russian and English, the languages common to all those present. Then a light lunch -- antipasti, lake trout, chilled Vernaccia wine, fresh figs and apricots -- is served on the terrace. Afterwards the twelve men pour themselves coffee, contemplate the breeze-ruffled expanse of the lake, and pace the garden. There are no security people, because at this level of secrecy, security people themselves become a risk. Before long the men have returned to their places in the shadowed conference room. The day's agenda is simply headed "EUROPE."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Salvatore Greco has dedicated his life to resurrecting the influence of his family, which lost its place in the Cosa Nostra power structure in the 1990s, following the murder of Salvatore's father by a member of the rival Matteo family. A quarter of a century later Salvatore has hunted down and killed all of the surviving Mattei. The Greci, and their associates the Messini, are the richest, most powerful, and most feared of the Sicilian clans. Salvatore is known to have personally murdered at least sixty people, and to have ordered the deaths of hundreds more. Today, at fifty-five years of age, his hold over Palermo and its drug trade is absolute. His enterprises, worldwide, turn over some twenty to thirty billion dollars. Gentlemen, he's practically one of us."</div>

But recently he has started ordering the assassination of members of the establishment. To date, his tally is two judges and four senior magistrates, all killed by car bombs, and an investigative journalist, who was gunned down last month outside her apartment.

A month ago I sent an intermediary to arrange a meeting with him, as I felt that we needed to reach some sort of accommodation.

From the east comes the murmur of traffic on the Boulevard Suchet, to the west is the Bois de Boulogne and the Auteuil racecourse. The club's garden is bordered by a trellis hung with blossoming jasmine whose scent infuses the warm air. Most of the other tables are occupied, but conversation is muted.

<div class="line_en">Definitely not brother and sister, Villanelle decides. There's a tension between them -- a complicity -- that's anything but familial. They're certainly rich, though.

In six months' time she was due to sit her finals.

<div class="line_en">No one ever visits her here -- her professional meetings take place in cafes and public parks, her sexual liaisons are mostly conducted in hotels -- but if they were to do so, the apartment would bear out her cover story in every detail. In the study, her computer, a top-of-the-range wafer of stainless steel, is protected by civilian security software that a halfway skilled hacker would quickly bypass. But a scan of its contents would reveal little more than the details of a successful day-trading account, and the contents of the filing cabinet are similarly non-committal. There is no music system.

<div class="line_en">Conditions at the remand centre were unspeakable. The food was barely edible, the sanitation non-existent, and an icy, numbing wind from the Dobryanka river penetrated every cheerless corner of the institution. The slightest infraction of the rules resulted in a prolonged period of shiza, or solitary confinement. Oxana had been there for three months when she was ordered from her cell, marched without explanation to the prison courtyard, and ordered to climb into a battered all-terrain vehicle. Two hours later, deep in the Perm Krai, the driver halted by a bridge over the frozen Chusovaya river, and wordlessly directed her to a low, prefabricated unit, beside which a black four-wheel- drive Mercedes was parked. Inside the unit, there was just enough room for a table, two chairs, and a paraffin heater.</div>

<div class="line_en">She re-reads the document file, scanning each sentence for a possible entrée. Greco's principal residence, a farmhouse in a hill-village outside Palermo, is a fortress. His family lives there, protected by a loyal and vigilant team of armed bodyguards. His wife, Calogera, rarely leaves home; his only daughter, Valentina, lives in a neighbouring village, where she is married to the oldest son of her father's consigliere. The region has its own dialect and a history of obdurate hostility to outsiders. Those whom Greco wishes to meet -- allied clan members, prospective associates, his tailor, his barber -- are invited to the farmhouse, where they are searched, and if necessary disarmed.

<div class="line_en">One document in particular, though, interests Villanelle. It's a five-year-old press cutting from the Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera reporting a near-fatal accident sustained by one of the paper's own journalists in Rome. According to Bruno De Santis: "I was coming out of a restaurant in Trastevere when a car came racing towards me on the wrong side of the street. The next thing I knew, I was in hospital, lucky to be alive."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，其中一份文件尤其吸引了薇拉内拉的注意。那是一份五年前从意大利晚邮报上剪下来的新闻，报道了该报一名记者在罗马遭遇了一次几乎致命的事故。据布鲁诺·德·桑蒂斯所说：“我从特拉斯迪维尔的一家餐馆出来时，一辆车从街的另一边向我冲来。等我恢复意识之后，我发现我在医院里，幸好还活着。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">De Santis's none-too-subtle suggestion is that this attempt on his life is the consequence of a piece he wrote for the Corriere a month earlier, about a young Sicilian soprano named Franca Farfaglia. In the piece, he criticised Farfaglia for having accepted a donation towards her studies at the La Scala Theatre Academy in Milan from Salvatore Greco, "the notorious organised crime boss."</div>

<div class="line_en">It is a brave and perhaps foolhardy piece of journalism, but Villanelle is not interested in De Santis.

Several of the images reappear on the singer's own website, where there's a history of her career to date, a selection of performance reviews, and her schedule for the next few months.

<div class="line_en">The worst came first. Six weeks of fitness training and unarmed combat on a lonely, wind-scoured stretch of the Essex coast. She arrived in early December. The instructor was a former Special Boat Service instructor named Frank, a knotty, taciturn figure of about sixty, with a gaze as cold as the North Sea. His habitual get-up, worn in all weathers, was a faded cotton tracksuit and a pair of old tennis shoes. Frank was merciless. Oxana was underweight and in poor condition following her months in the Dobryanka remand centre, and for the first fortnight the interminable runs across the marshes, with the sleet whipping at her face and the greasy coastal mud sucking at her boots, were torture.</div>

<div class="line_en">Determination kept her going. Anything, even death from exposure on the mudflats, was better than returning to the Russian penal system. Frank didn't know who she was, and didn't care. His brief was simply to bring her to combat readiness. For the duration of the course she lived in an unheated Nissen hut on a mud-and-shingle island linked to the mainland by a quarter-mile-long causeway. During the Cold War, the place had been an early warning station, and something of its grim, apocalyptic purpose lingered.</div>

<div class="line_en">On the first night Oxana was so cold she couldn't sleep, but from then on exhaustion took its toll, and she was wrapped in her single blanket and dead to the world by 9 p. m. Frank kicked the corrugated-iron door open every morning at 4 a. m. before tossing her the day's rations -- usually a plastic canteen of water and a couple of tins of processed meat and vegetables -- and leaving her to pull on her T-shirt, combat trousers and boots, invariably still sodden from the day before. For two hours they ran repeated circuits of the island, either across the oozing grey mudflats or along the icy tideline, before returning to the Nissen hut to brew tea and heat up a mess-tin of rations on a small hexamine stove. By sunrise, they would be outside again, pounding the mudflats until Oxana was vomiting with fatigue.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the afternoons, as the darkness closed in, they worked on hand-to-hand combat. Over the years Frank had taken elements of ju-jitsu, street-fighting and other techniques and refined them into a single discipline. The emphasis was on improvisation and speed, and practice sessions were often conducted knee-deep in the sea, with the mud and shingle shifting treacherously beneath their feet. Realising that her English was poor, Frank taught by physical example. Oxana thought she knew a thing or two about fighting, having learnt the basics of the Systema Spetsnaz from her father, but Frank seemed to anticipate every move she attempted, deflecting her blows with casual ease before pitching her, yet again, into the icy seawater.</div>

<div class="line_en">Late one afternoon in the final week they were circling each other in the incoming tide. Frank had a Gerber knife with an eight-inch blade, Oxana was unarmed. Frank moved first, swinging the oxidised blade so close to her face that she felt the breeze of its passing, and in response she ducked under his knife-arm and hammered a short-arm punch into his ribs. It stopped him for a second, and by the time the Gerber came slicing back she was out of reach. They danced back and forth, and Frank lunged for her chest. Her body outraced her brain. Half-turning she grabbed his wrist, wrenched him in the direction to which he was already committed, and booted his legs from under him. As Frank fell backwards into the water, arms flailing, she was already lifting her knee to stamp his knife-hand into the shingle --"Control the weapon, then the man" her father had always told her -- and as the instructor involuntarily released the Gerber, fell forwards to pin him underwater. Straddling him, she forced his head back with the palm of her hand, and watched the agonised working of his face as he began to drown.</div>

This was calculatedly nightmarish, and designed to induce maximal stress and anxiety in its subjects. Shortly after her arrival Oxana was stripped naked by her male guards and marched to a brightly lit, windowless cell, empty except for a close-circuit camera mounted high on one wall. Time passed, hour after endless hour, but she was given only water, and without toilet facilities was forced to use the floor. Before long the cell stank, and her stomach was twisting with hunger.

Between these sessions, in which she was offered food in exchange for information, she was forced to adopt agonising and humiliating stress positions. Starved, sleep-deprived and severely disoriented, she drifted into a trance-like state, in which the boundaries between her senses blurred. She managed, nevertheless, to hang on to some vestigial sense of self, and to the knowledge that the experience would come to an end. However terrifying and degrading it turned out to be, it was preferable to life in the secure wing of a Ural Mountains penal colony.

<div class="line_en">Not that it was ever quite enough. Because for all its fierce excitement, that moment of submission invariably marked the end of Oxana's interest. The story was always the same, even with Yuliana, the psychotherapist. By yielding to Oxana, by surrendering her mystery, she made herself undesirable. And Oxana simply moved on, leaving the older woman bereft, her personal and professional self-esteem in tatters.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是这还不够。因为奥克萨娜这种强烈的兴奋，在对方屈服的那一刻便已经结束了。故事总是一样的，即使对象是那个心理医生，尤丽安娜。她向奥克萨娜屈服，她向奥克萨娜的神秘投降，这使她变得不再那么令人渴望了。奥克萨娜继续着她的生活，把那个丧失亲人、失去了职业道德的老妇人抛在脑后。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After the sniper course, she learnt about explosives and toxicology in Volgograd, surveillance in Berlin, advanced driving and lock-picking in London, and identity management, communications and coding in Paris. For Oxana, who had never left Russia before her appointment with Konstantin at the Chusovaya Bridge, the international travelling was dizzying. Each course was taught in the language of the country in question, testing her linguistic aptitude to the limit and, more often than not, leaving her mentally as well as physically drained.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在狙击课程结束之后，奥克萨娜在伏尔加格勒学习了炸药学和毒理学，在柏林学习了盯梢，在伦敦学习了高级驾驶和开锁，在巴黎学习了身份管理、通信和编码。在丘索瓦亚大桥上和康斯坦丁见面之前，奥克萨娜从未离开过俄罗斯，对于她来说，这些国际旅行相当让人头晕眼花。每门课程都是用当地的语言教学，几乎在测试她的语言能力极限，这往往会使她身心俱疲。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Throughout it all, patient and imperturbable on the sidelines, was Konstantin. He maintained a professional distance between himself and Oxana, but was sympathetic towards her on the handful of occasions when the pressure became too much, and she demanded, coldly, to be left alone. "Take a day off," he told her on one occasion in London. "Go and explore the city. And start thinking about your cover name. Oxana Vorontsova's dead."</div>

<div class="line_en">By November, her training was almost over. She had been staying in a dingy one-star hotel in the Paris suburb of Belleville, and travelling every day to an anonymous office building in La Défense, where a young man of Indian origin was teaching her the finer points of steganography -- the science of concealing secret information in computer files. On the final day of the course Konstantin appeared, paid her hotel bill, and accompanied her to an apartment on the Quai Voltaire, on the Left Bank.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到十一月时，奥克萨娜的训练基本宣告结束。她住在巴黎贝尔维尔郊区的一家肮脏的一星级酒店里，每天到拉德芳斯街道上的不知名建筑里游玩，在那儿一个印度人教她精妙的加密速记术——一门将秘密信息隐藏在电脑文件里的学问。在学习的最后一天康斯坦丁露了面，把她在宾馆的帐结了，并陪她去了银行左岸的伏尔泰河沿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The first-floor apartment was furnished with spare, minimal chic. Its occupant was a tiny, fierce-looking woman of about sixty, dressed completely in black, whom Konstantin introduced as Fantine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="公寓的一层被装饰的简约精致。它的主人是一个身材娇小，面容凶猛的六十岁左右的女人，穿着全黑的衣服，康斯坦丁把她称为芳汀。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Fantine stared at Oxana, appeared unimpressed by what she saw, and asked her to walk around the room. Self-conscious in her faded T-shirt, jeans and trainers, Oxana complied. Fantine watched her for a moment, turned to Konstantin, and shrugged.</div>

<div class="line_en">And so began the final stage of Oxana's transformation. She moved into a four-star hotel two streets away, and each morning joined Fantine for breakfast in the first-floor apartment. At nine o'clock every morning a car came for them. On the first day they went to the Galeries Lafayette on Boulevard Haussmann. Fantine marched Oxana round the department store, ordering her to try on a succession of outfits -- daywear, casual, evening -- and buying them whether Oxana liked them or not. The tight, flashy clothes to which Oxana was drawn Fantine dismissed without a glance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，奥克萨娜转变的最后阶段开始了。她搬进两条街外的一家四星级酒店，每天早上都会在一楼的公寓里和芳汀一起吃早餐。每天早上九点，一辆车来接他们。第一天，他们去豪斯曼大道的拉斐德百货公司。芳汀带着奥克萨娜在百货公司里逛了一圈，命令她试穿一系列的服装，包括日装、休闲装、晚装——不管奥克萨娜喜欢与否，都要买。而奥克萨娜穿着的那种紧身的、浮夸的衣服，芳汀看都不看就驳回了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">By the end of the day, the car was piled high with shopping bags, and Oxana was beginning to enjoy the company of her ruthlessly critical mentor. Over the week that followed they visited shoe shops and fashion houses, couture and prêt-à-porter shows, a vintage emporium in St. Germain, and the costume and design museum at the Palais Galliera. At each of these, Fantine offered an unsparing commentary. This was chic, clever and elegant; that was crass, tasteless and irredeemably vulgar. One afternoon Fantine took Oxana to a hairdresser in the Place des Victoires. Her instructions to the stylist were to proceed as she chose, and to ignore anything that Oxana suggested. Afterwards, Fantine stood her in front of a mirror, and Oxana ran a hand through her short, blunt-cut hair. She liked the look that Fantine had put together for her. The designer biker jacket, the stripy T-shirt, the low-rise jeans and ankle boots. She looked… Parisian.</div>

<div class="line_en">Later that afternoon, they visited a boutique selling scent on the rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré. "Choose," said Fantine. "But choose well." For ten minutes Oxana stalked the elegant shop floor, before stopping in front of a glass display cabinet. The assistant watched her for a moment. "Vous permettez, Mademoiselle?" he murmured, handing her a slender glass phial with a scarlet ribbon at its neck. Cautiously, Oxana touched the amber scent to her wrist. Fresh as a spring dawn, but with darker base notes, it spoke to something deep inside her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天下午晚些时候，她们去郊外圣奥诺雷街上的一家香水店。“选吧，”芳汀说，“但是选瓶好的。”奥克萨娜在这家优雅的商店里徘徊了十分钟，直到她停在一个玻璃橱柜前面。店员看了她一会。“请允许我，小姐？”他低声说，然后递给她一个细细的玻璃瓶，瓶颈上系着一条红色缎带。奥克萨娜小心翼翼地触摸了一下手腕上的琥珀色香味。像春天的曙光一样清新，有着很深的基调，它似乎向她内心深处的某种东西诉说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's called Villanelle," said the assistant. "It was the favourite scent of the Comtesse du Barry. The perfume house added the red ribbon after she was guillotined in 1793."</div>

<div class="line_en">As she crosses the Piazza Verdi in Palermo, her heels clicking faintly on the cobblestones, Villanelle glances up at the imposing frontage of Sicily's, and indeed Italy's, largest opera house. Palm trees rise from the piazza, their leaves whispering faintly in the warm breeze; bronze lions flank the broad entrance stairway. Villanelle is wearing a silk Valentino dress and elbow-length Fratelli Orsini opera gloves. The dress is red, but so darkly shaded as to be almost black. A spacious Fendi shoulder bag hangs by a slim chain. Villanelle's face is pale in the evening light, and her hair is pinned up with a long, curved clip. She looks glamorous, if less showy than the socialites in Versace and Dolce &amp; Gabbana thronging the mirrored entrance hall. First nights at the Teatro Massimo are always an occasion, and tonight's offering is Puccini's Tosca, one of the most popular operas of all. That the title role is being sung by a local soprano, Franca Farfaglia, makes the occasion unmissable.</div>

They had recognised her talent, sought her out, and taken her from the lowest place in the world to the highest, where she belonged. A predator, an instrument of evolution, one of that elite to whom no moral law applied. Inside her, this knowledge bloomed like a great dark rose, filling every cavity of her being.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她没有那样。她的生活平静无波。她成为了匆匆从一处赶往另一处的单调大军中的一员，他们的孤独深深地印在目光中。她不知道给予她处刑权利的是什么权威。她没有问康斯坦丁，因为她确定他不会告诉他，事实上，她其实根本不在乎。对于薇拉内拉来说，最重要的是她被选中了。她被选择成为一个无所不能的组织的工具，而那个组织理解她的与众不同，就像她自己一直理解的那样。他们识别出了她的天赋，把她挑选出来，并且把她从世界最低处带到最高处——她应当归属的地方。一个捕食者，一个进化中的手段，一个不适用于任何法律道德的精英。在她心中，这种知识像一朵巨大的黑玫瑰一样盛开，填满了她生命的每一个空洞。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Slowly, the auditorium of the Teatro Massimo begins to fill. Sitting back in her seat, Villanelle studies the programme, her face shadowed by the partition between her box and the next. The performance time arrives and the house lights dim, the audience hubbub fading to silence. As the conductor takes his bow, to warm applause, Villanelle hears a figure quietly take his place in the adjoining box. She doesn't turn, and as the curtain rises on the first act, leans forward to gaze with rapt attention at the stage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="慢慢地，马西莫剧院的礼堂开始坐满了人。薇拉内拉靠在椅子上，研究着这个节目，她的包厢和隔壁包厢之间的隔墙的阴影笼罩在她的脸上。演出时间到了，场灯暗了下来，观众的喧哗声渐渐消失。当指挥鞠躬并获得热烈的掌声时，薇拉内拉听见一个人悄悄的进入了隔壁包厢，坐到了他的位置上。她没有转身，当第一幕的幕布升起时，她俯身凝视舞台，全神贯注。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Minute succeeds minute; time is slowed to a crawl. Puccini's music engulfs Villanelle, but does not touch her. Her consciousness is focused, in its entirety, on the unseen person to her left. She forces herself not to look, but senses his presence like a pulse, malign and infinitely dangerous. At moments, she feels a coldness at the nape of her neck, and knows that he is watching her. Finally the strains of the Te Deum die away, the first act ends, and the crimson and gold curtain falls.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一分钟接一分钟；时间慢的像在爬行。普契尼音乐包围了薇拉内拉，但没有感动她。她的意识全部集中在她左边那个看不见的人身上。她强迫自己不要去看，但她能感觉到他的存在，像一个恶意的、无限危险的脉搏。有时候，她感觉脖子后面很冷，并且知道他在盯着她看。终于，赞美诗音乐逐渐消失了，第一幕结束了，深红色和金色的大幕落下了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As the house lights come up for the interval, and conversation swells in the auditorium, Villanelle sits motionless as if hypnotised by the opera. Then, without a sideways glance, she stands and leaves the box, noting with her peripheral vision the presence of two bodyguards who are lounging, bored but watchful, at the end of the corridor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="幕间休息时，场灯亮了起来，观众的交谈声重新充满礼堂。薇拉内拉一动不动地坐着，好像被歌剧催眠了似的。然后，她目不斜视的站了起来，离开了包厢。她用余光注意到走廊尽头有两名保镖懒洋洋的闲逛着，无聊但机警。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Moving unhurriedly into the vestibule, she makes her way to the bar and orders a glass of mineral water, which she holds but doesn't drink. At the far end of the room, she sees Leoluca Messina moving towards her. Pretending she hasn't seen him, she turns into the crowd, re-emerging near the entrance to the foyer. Outside, on the opera house steps, the heat of the day has not yet abated. The sky is rose-pink over the sea, a livid purple overhead. Half-a-dozen young men passing Villanelle whistle and make appreciative comments in the local dialect.</div>

<div class="line_en">She returns and takes her place in her box moments before the curtain rises on the second act. Once again she makes a point of not glancing to her left at Greco; instead, she gazes fixedly at the stage as the opera unfolds. The story is a dramatic one. Tosca, a singer, is in love with the painter Cavaradossi, who has been falsely accused of aiding the escape of a political prisoner. Arrested by Scarpia, the chief of police, Cavaradossi is condemned to die. Scarpia, however, proposes a deal: if Tosca gives herself to him, Cavaradossi will be released. Tosca agrees, but when Scarpia approaches her, she seizes a knife and kills him.</div>

<div class="line_en">The curtain falls. And this time, when Villanelle has finished applauding, she turns to Greco and smiles, as if seeing him for the first time. It is not long before there is a knock at the door of the box. It is one of the bodyguards, a heavyset man who enquires, not discourteously, if she would care to join Don Salvatore for a glass of wine. Villanelle hesitates for a moment and then politely nods her acceptance. As she steps into the corridor the second bodyguard looks her up and down. She has left her bag in the box, her hands are empty, and the Valentino dress clings to her lean, athletic form. The two men glance knowingly at each other. It is clear that they have delivered many women to their boss. The heavyset man gestures to the door of Greco's box. "Per favore, Signorina…"</div>

<div class="line_en">They talk. For Villanelle, language is fluid. Most of the time she thinks in French, but every so often she awakes and knows that she's been dreaming in Russian. At times, close to sleep, the blood roars in her ears, an unstoppable tide shot through with polyglot screams. On such occasions, alone in the Paris apartment, she anaesthetises herself with hours of web-surfing, usually in English. And now, she notes, she is mentally playing out scenarios in Sicilian-inflected Italian. She hasn't sought out the language, but her head echoes with it. Is there any part of her that is still Oxana Vorontsova? Does she still exist, that little girl who lay night after night in urine-sodden sheets at the orphanage, planning her revenge?

<div class="line_en">As the opera continues, Villanelle once again gazes raptly at the stage, waiting for the moment that she has planned. This comes with the great love duet, "Amaro sol per te." As the final note dies away, the audience roars its applause, with cries of "Bravi!" and "Brava Franca!" echoing from every corner of the house. Villanelle applauds with the others, and eyes shining, turns to Greco. His eyes meet hers, and as if on impulse, he seizes her hand and kisses it. She holds his gaze for a moment, and raising her other hand to her hair, unfastens the long, curved clip, so that the dark tresses fall to her shoulders. And then her arm descends, a pale blur, and her clip is buried deep in his left eye.</div>

<div class="line_en">His face blanks with shock and pain. Villanelle presses the tiny plunger, injecting a lethal dose of veterinary-strength etorphine into the frontal lobe of his brain and inducing immediate paralysis. She lowers him to the floor, and glances around. Her own box is empty, and in the box beyond, an elderly couple are dimly visible, peering at the stage through opera glasses. All eyes are on Farfaglia and the tenor singing Cavaradossi, both standing motionless as wave after wave of applause breaks over them. Reaching over the partition, Villanelle recovers her bag, retires into the shadows, and takes out the Ruger. The double snap of the suppressed weapon is unremarkable, and the low-velocity.22 rounds leave barely a loose thread as they punch though Greco's linen jacket.</div>

She fires twice, less than a second separating the silenced shots, and both men drop to the carpeted floor. Blood jets briefly from the entry wounds in the back of their necks, but the men are already dead, their brainstems shot through. For several long seconds, Villanelle is overwhelmed by the intensity of the killings, and by a satisfaction so piercing that it's close to pain. It's the feeling that sex always promises but never quite delivers, and for a moment she clutches herself, gasping, through the Valentino dress. Then slipping the Ruger into her bag and squaring her shoulders, she exits the box.</div>

He parts a blanket-like curtain and suddenly they are backstage, in the heavy half-dark of the wings, with the music, relayed by tannoy from the orchestra pit, blaring about them. Men and women in nineteenth-century costume swim out of the shadows; stagehands move with regimented purpose. Placing an arm round Villanelle's shoulder, Messina hurries her past racks of costumes and tables set with props, then directs her into the narrow space between the cyclorama and the brick back wall.

<div class="line_en">Then more corridors, discoloured walls hung with fire extinguishers and instructions for emergency evacuation of the house, and finally they are stepping from the stage door onto the Piazza Verdi, with the sound of traffic in their ears and the livid purple sky overhead. Fifty metres away, a silver and black MV Agusta motorcycle is standing at a bollard on the Via Volturno. Villanelle climbs up behind Messina, and with a low growl of exhaust they glide into the night.</div>

<div class="line_en">It's several minutes before they hear the first police sirens. Leoluca is heading eastwards, winding through side streets, the MV Agusta nervily responsive to the sharp twists and turns. At intervals, to her left, Villanelle catches a glimpse of the lights of the port and the inky shimmer of the sea. People glance at them as they pass -- the man with the wolfish features, the woman in the scarlet dress -- but this is Palermo; no one looks too closely. The streets narrow, with washing suspended above and the sounds and smells of family meals issuing through open windows. And then a dark square, a derelict cinema and the baroque facade of a church.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几分钟后他们才听到第一声警笛。利奥卢卡向东行驶，穿过蜿蜒的街道，这辆MV阿古斯塔在曲折的路上表现良好。每隔一段时间，薇拉内拉就可以瞥见她左边港口的灯光和大海的墨色微光。当他们经过的时候，人们会瞥他们一眼——一个面色狼藉的男人，一个穿着红衣的女人时——但这是巴勒莫，没有人看得太仔细。街道狭窄，上面晾着衣物，从敞开的窗户传来家庭用餐的声音和气味。然后他们经过一个黑暗的广场，一个废弃的电影院和一个巴洛克式教堂的的正面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Rocking the bike onto its stand, Messina leads her down an alley beside the church, and unlocks a gate. They are in a walled cemetery, a city of the dead, with family tombs and mausoleums extending in dim rows into the night. "This is where they'll bury Salvatore when they've dug your bullets out of him," says Messina. "And sooner or later, where they'll bury me."</div>

<div class="line_en">He glances at her for a moment and walks away. The MV Agusta kicks into life with a snarl and fades into the night. Picking her way downhill between the tombs, Villanelle finds a small clearing in front of a pillared mausoleum. From the Fendi shoulder bag she takes a Briquet lighter, a crumpled blue cotton frock, a pair of wafer-thin sandals and a lingerie-fabric money belt. The money belt holds 500 in cash, an airline ticket, and a passport and credit card identifying her as Irina Skoryk, a French national born in Ukraine.</div>

<div class="line_en">Quickly changing her clothes, Villanelle makes a pyre of the Valentino dress, all documents relating to Sylviane Morel, and the green contact lenses and brunette wig that she has been wearing.

<div class="line_cn" title="薇拉内拉迅速换完了衣服，把华伦天奴的裙子、所有与西尔维亚·莫雷尔有关的文件，以及她戴的绿色隐形眼镜和浅褐色假发堆成了一堆。火短暂而强烈地燃烧着，当一切消失殆尽时，她用一根柏树树枝把灰烬扫进了灌木丛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Continuing downhill, Villanelle finds a rusty exit gate, and a path leading down steps to a narrow lane. This gives onto a broader, busier road, which she follows westwards towards the city centre. After twenty minutes she finds what she has been looking for: a large wheeled garbage bin behind a restaurant, overflowing with kitchen waste. Pulling on the opera gloves she looks around her, and makes sure that she's unobserved. Then she plunges both hands into the bin, and pulls out half a dozen bags. Unknotting one, she thrusts the Fendi shoulder bag and the Ruger into the stinking mess of clam shells, fish heads and coffee grounds. Returning the bag to the bin, she piles the others on top. Last to disappear are the gloves. The whole operation has taken less than thirty seconds. Unhurriedly, she continues walking westwards.</div>

<div class="line_en">At 11 a. m. the following morning, agent Paolo Vella of the Polizia di Stato is standing at the bar of a cafe in the Piazza Olivella, taking coffee with a colleague. It has been a long morning; since dawn Vella has been manning the cordon at the main entrance to the Teatro Massimo, now a crime scene. The crowds, by and large, have been respectful, keeping their distance. Nothing has been officially announced, but all Palermo seems to know that Don Salvatore Greco has been assassinated. Theories abound, but the general assumption is that this is family business. There's a rumour that the hit was carried out by a woman. But there are always rumours.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Will you look at that," breathes Vella, all thoughts of the Greco murder temporarily banished. His colleague follows his gaze out of the cafe into the busy street, where a young woman in a blue sundress -- a tourist, evidently -- has paused to watch the sudden ascent of a flight of pigeons. Her lips are parted, her grey eyes shine, the morning light illuminates her close-cropped hair.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“来看看这个，”维拉低声说，所有关于格雷克谋杀案的想法都暂时消失了。他的同事跟着他从咖啡厅走进繁华的街道，一个穿着蓝色的背心裙年轻女人——一个旅客，很明显——停下了脚步看着一群鸽子突然飞起。她的嘴唇微微张开，灰色的眼睛闪闪发光，上午的阳光使她的短发闪闪发光。">查看中文翻译</div>
