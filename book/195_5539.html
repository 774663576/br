<div class="line_en">Next day Philip arrived at Blackstable. Since the death of his mother he had never lost anyone closely connected with him; his aunt's death shocked him and filled him also with a curious fear; he felt for the first time his own mortality. He could not realise what life would be for his uncle without the constant companionship of the woman who had loved and tended him for forty years. He expected to find him broken down with hopeless grief. He dreaded the first meeting; he knew that he could say nothing which would be of use. He rehearsed to himself a number of apposite speeches.</div>

<div class="line_en">He sank on his knees, and because it was expected of him Philip followed his example. He looked at the little shrivelled face. He was only conscious of one emotion: what a wasted life! In a minute Mr. Carey gave a cough, and stood up. He pointed to a wreath at the foot of the bed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他双膝跪地，菲利普知道他想让自己也跟着做，所以也跪了下来。看着伯母那张皱巴巴的小脸，他心里此时只有一种感受：这被虚度浪费了的一生啊！过了一会儿，伯伯咳嗽一声，站起身来，指了指伯母脚边的花圈：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“这是我们这里的地主送来的。”他的声音很低，像是在教堂做礼拜一样。此时此刻他的身份也似乎仅仅是个牧师。“我想茶点应该已经备好了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They went down again to the dining-room. The drawn blinds gave a lugubrious aspect. The Vicar sat at the end of the table at which his wife had always sat and poured out the tea with ceremony. Philip could not help feeling that neither of them should have been able to eat anything, but when he saw that his uncle's appetite was unimpaired he fell to with his usual heartiness. They did not speak for a while. Philip set himself to eat an excellent cake with the air of grief which he felt was decent.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们又回到餐厅。百叶窗已经合上了，屋子里有些昏暗，凄惨的气氛弥漫开来，蔓延到整个房间。牧师坐在桌子的一端，那是他妻子生前的位置。他倒茶的模样看起来非常正式。菲利普禁不住想他们理应悲痛万分，食不下咽，可看到伯伯的胃口似乎完全没有受到影响，所以自己也敞开肚皮吃了起来。他们谁也没作声。菲利普怀着沉痛的心情吞下一块非常可口的蛋糕，似乎此时此刻只有表现得忧伤一点才是得体之举。">查看中文翻译</div>

Louisa never liked Mrs. Rawlingson.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Things have changed a great deal since I was a curate," said the Vicar presently.

<div class="line_en">Josiah Graves, churchwarden and manager of the bank, came back to dinner at the vicarage after the funeral. The blinds had been drawn up, and Philip, against his will, felt a curious sensation of relief. The body in the house had made him uncomfortable: in life the poor woman had been all that was kind and gentle; and yet, when she lay upstairs in her bed-room, cold and stark, it seemed as though she cast upon the survivors a baleful influence. The thought horrified Philip.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="教会执事兼银行经理乔西亚·格雷夫斯参加完教区的葬礼后随他们一起回来晚餐。餐厅的百叶窗打开了，菲利普莫名奇妙地觉得松快了些，尽管他知道此刻这种感觉是不被允许的。之前楼上躺着的尸体让他心里很不舒服。那个可怜的女人在世时善良体贴，但现在她的尸体躺在楼上的床上，硬邦邦、冷瑟瑟。一层晦气可怕的暗影飘飘而下，笼罩着这些还在世的人。一想到这，菲利普心里就毛毛的。">查看中文翻译</div>

Things were going rather far if he could not choose his own text for his own wife's tombstone. There was a pause, and then the conversation drifted to parish matters. Philip went into the garden to smoke his pipe. He sat on a bench, and suddenly began to laugh hysterically.</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip did not reply. He had thought much of what Foinet said to him, but he was still so undecided that he did not wish to speak of the future. There would be something fine in giving up art because he was convinced that he could not excel; but unfortunately it would seem so only to himself: to others it would be an admission of defeat, and he did not want to confess that he was beaten. He was an obstinate fellow, and the suspicion that his talent did not lie in one direction made him inclined to force circumstances and aim notwithstanding precisely in that direction. He could not bear that his friends should laugh at him. This might have prevented him from ever taking the definite step of abandoning the study of painting, but the different environment made him on a sudden see things differently. Like many another he discovered that crossing the Channel makes things which had seemed important singularly futile. The life which had been so charming that he could not bear to leave it now seemed inept; he was seized with a distaste for the cafes, the restaurants with their ill-cooked food, the shabby way in which they all lived. He did not care any more what his friends thought about him: Cronshaw with his rhetoric, Mrs. Otter with her respectability, Ruth Chalice with her affectations, Lawson and Clutton with their quarrels; he felt a revulsion from them all. He wrote to Lawson and asked him to send over all his belongings. A week later they arrived. When he unpacked his canvases he found himself able to examine his work without emotion. He noticed the fact with interest. His uncle was anxious to see his pictures. Though he had so greatly disapproved of Philip's desire to go to Paris, he accepted the situation now with equanimity. He was interested in the life of students and constantly put Philip questions about it. He was in fact a little proud of him because he was a painter, and when people were present made attempts to draw him out. He looked eagerly at the studies of models which Philip showed him. Philip set before him his portrait of Miguel Ajuria.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普没吱声。把福瓦内说的话想了一遍又一遍，但始终没个主意，也不想再讨论关于未来的事了。他已经确信自己无法成为画家中的佼佼者，所以放下画笔似乎是个正确的选择。但不幸的是，这个选择好像只对他来说是正确的。在别人看来，放弃画画就是承认失败。可他不想承认自己的失败。他很倔强，明明知道自己可能不是做某件事的料，却偏要逆流而上，非做不行。一想到朋友们可能会嘲笑自己，他就觉得受不了。这种对别人看法的介意让他之前一直迟迟不能下定决心放弃画画，而现在环境变了，他的想法也忽然变了。他和其他人一样，一跨过英吉利海峡就发现曾经那么重要的事现在已经变得无所谓了。在海峡那边时他曾觉得如此美好、几乎舍不得荒废一分一秒的人生，现在看来也变得愚昧又荒谬。他想起巴黎的咖啡馆、小饭店里难以下咽的饭菜和朋友们邋邋遢遢、寒酸无比的生活，一股厌恶之情油然而生。他不在乎朋友会怎么看他了。花言巧语的克朗肖、道貌岸然的奥特夫人、搔首弄姿的露丝·查理斯和斗鸡一样的劳森、克拉顿，这些人统统都变得那么讨厌！他给劳森去了封信，请他把自己的全部家当都寄回来。一个礼拜后，包裹邮到了。他整理东西的时候发现自己现在可以不带任何情感地、清醒地打量自己的画作。这整件事似乎很有意思，值得玩味。伯伯等不及想看看他的画。虽然当初他百般阻挠，不让菲利普去巴黎，但现在他的心情平静了不少，头脑也清醒了一些。他很好奇学生们的生活是个什么样，也不时跟菲利普问东问西。侄子成了个画家，这件事让他有点骄傲。只要一有外人在场，他就要把菲利普的事拿出来显摆显摆。他兴致勃勃地翻看着菲利普拿出来的肖像画。菲利普把他给米盖尔·阿胡利亚画的那张头像摆到他眼前。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"'A rolling stone gathers no moss,'" proceeded the clergyman. Philip hated that proverb above all, and it seemed to him perfectly meaningless. His uncle had repeated it often during the arguments which had preceded his departure from business. Apparently it recalled that occasion to his guardian.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“滚石不生苔，转业不聚财。”牧师又接了一句。菲利普最讨厌这句老话，他觉得这句话对自己没有分毫意义。当初他硬要离开会计事务所时，他的监护人伯伯就总把这句话搬出来。显然此情此景又让他想起了当年的事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip knew by now that whenever anyone was angry with him his first thought was to say something about his club-foot. His estimate of the human race was determined by the fact that scarcely anyone failed to resist the temptation. But he had trained himself not to show any sign that the reminder wounded him. He had even acquired control over the blushing which in his boyhood had been one of his torments.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普现在发现，但凡有人生他的气了，第一个念头就是拿他的跛足说事。他觉得自己已经把人性看了个透彻，没有人能够抵抗这种戳人痛处所带来的报复的快意。他苦苦磨炼自己，终于能够在别人提及他的残疾时装出无所谓的样子。小时候他动不动就会脸红，不过现在慢慢能控制住了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Vicar looked up at his nephew quickly to see whether he was laughing at him. Philip's face was serious, but there was a twinkle in his eyes which irritated him. Philip should really be getting more serious. He felt it right to give him a rap over the knuckles.</div>

<div class="line_en">He had thought of doctoring among other things, chiefly because it was an occupation which seemed to give a good deal of personal freedom, and his experience of life in an office had made him determine never to have anything more to do with one; his answer to the Vicar slipped out almost unawares, because it was in the nature of a repartee. It amused him to make up his mind in that accidental way, and he resolved then and there to enter his father's old hospital in the autumn.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="之所以他能在那么多选择里想到医生，主要是因为这个行业似乎有更多的私人时间。他坐过办公室，那段经历让他宁死也不想再踏进办公室一步。他顺着牧师的话脱口而出，根本就是不假思索的随机应变。可他觉得用这种偶然的方式做出一项重大决定实在有趣，所以当机立断决定秋天就去爸爸生前所在的医院学习。">查看中文翻译</div>
