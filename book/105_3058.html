<div class="line_en">Dylan didn't know how long she lay on the floor. She couldn't take her eyes from the doorway. Any moment Tristan was going to walk through it, windswept, breathless, but fine. He was going to appear and be okay and take control. He had to. Her heart was crashing in her chest, straining painfully against muscles that felt locked in stone. Completely drained from her exertions, her body started to shake.</div>

<div class="line_en">Her muscles protested painfully, making her groan as she pulled herself up into a sitting position. She still didn't dare take her eyes from the doorway. Tristan was going to arrive any second, as long as she kept looking. Somewhere at the back of her mind a small voice told her that this was ridiculous, but she held on to the belief, because it was the only thing keeping the panic from rising up in her throat and erupting in uncontrollable screaming.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dylan managed to get her quivering legs underneath her and, with the support of the doorframe, hauled herself to her feet. She kept a firm hold on the rotting timber, swaying dangerously. Fear and fatigue had stripped her of every inch of energy. Standing on the threshold, she could hear the whispering and screaming outside, although something about the safe house seemed to dull the noise. Keeping her feet firmly behind the line, she leaned her head out, searching the night for a glimpse of blue eyes or tousled blond hair. Her eyes found nothing, but her ears were assaulted by a barrage of noise; outraged shrieking as the demons attempted to assail her but were frustrated by whatever supernatural charm the safe house held. Gasping with shock, she yanked her head back and the noise instantly dimmed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦尽力支撑起颤抖的双腿，借助门框的帮助，她终于站了起来。她紧紧抓着那块摇摇欲坠的朽木，又恐惧又疲劳，连一丁点力气也没有了。她站在门槛上，可以听到外面恶魔们的低语声和咆哮声，尽管这避难所附近有什么东西已经让噪声小了不少。她的脚牢牢地扎在门槛后，只把头探出去望着夜空，希望能看到那双蓝蓝的眼睛或是那一头凌乱的金发。她的眼睛一无所获，但是连续的噪声却袭扰着她的耳朵。企图朝她扑过来的恶魔们被安全屋的某种魔力击退，发出一声声愤怒的吼叫。迪伦倒吸了一口冷气，把头缩了回来，那噪声立刻减弱了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dylan backed away from the door slowly. Her feet caught on something on the floor and she almost tripped. She ripped her eyes away from the doorway for a fraction of a second, but it was almost pitch black and she couldn't make out what she'd stepped on. That sent another wave of terror through Dylan. She could not bear a night alone in the dark here. She would go insane.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦慢慢地从门口退回屋里。她突然踩到了什么东西几乎绊倒，在那电光火石的一瞬间，她的目光暂时离开了门口，但是屋里一片漆黑，她看不清自己到底踩到了什么，这让迪伦感到毛骨悚然。她无法忍受晚上独自一个人待在黑暗中，那样她会疯掉的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Please," she whispered, aware that she was begging an inanimate object to work but unable to stop herself. "Please, I need this." On the last word her composure broke and strangled sobs broke through. Her chest convulsed and her eyelids squeezed together as the first teardrop slipped down her cheeks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“拜托了。”她低声说着。她意识到自己是在恳求一个无生命的东西正常运转，但还是没办法阻止自己，“求你了，我需要这个。”说完最后一个词，她的那点镇定土崩瓦解，压抑已久的啜泣再也压不住了。她的胸口颤抖，双目紧闭，第一滴泪水顺着脸颊滑落下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Fire. There was always a fireplace in these cottages. But she was going to have to turn away from the door, and that meant facing the fact that Tristan might be gone. No, she told herself. He would come. She should just get the fire sorted for when he arrived. She felt her way across the cottage, and sure enough at the other end of the room was a stone fireplace. Kneeling, she searched with her fingertips. Her fingers brushed against ash and lumps of wood in the grate. To the left of it she found some dry logs, but no matches, and no electronic switch like the one back home that would make fake flames dance and jolt while a fan heater blew out hot air that was almost as welcome as the light.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="火！这些小屋里总有壁炉。可她必须转身离开门，这就意味着要面对崔斯坦可能离开的现实。不，她告诉自己，崔斯坦会回来的。等他到的时候，她应该恰好能生起火了。她摸索着穿过屋子，在小屋的一头真的有一个石壁炉。她跪下来，用指尖摸索。她的手指拂过炉栅里的炉灰和木块。她在它的左边找到了一些干木柴，但是没有火柴，也没有家里那样的电子开关，能在暖风机吹出热空气的同时让电子火焰摇曳舞蹈，那样的热风和灯光一样让人渴望。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A crackling noise made her open them, momentarily afraid, but what she saw made her gasp with shock. There were flames in the fireplace. They were small and flickered in the draft from the open door, but they refused to be put out. As if they were acting of their own accord, Dylan's hands reached out and grabbed a couple of logs. She placed them delicately on the fire, holding her breath in case her clumsy actions smothered the fledgling flames.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一声噼噼啪啪的爆裂声让她睁开了眼，瞬间显露惊惧之色。但眼前的一幕却让她惊讶得倒抽了一口气。壁炉里冒出了火焰，火苗微弱，在从门口吹来的风中摇曳不定，却顽强地持续燃烧着。迪伦的手不由自主地伸出来，抓起了一把木柴。她小心翼翼地把它们放在火上，屏住呼吸，生怕自己一时的毛手毛脚会扼杀这初生的火焰。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As the latch clicked closed, something broke within Dylan. Tears blinding her, she blundered sightless across the room until she met what felt like a bed. She threw herself onto it and gave way to the sobs that threatened to overwhelm her. Panic engulfed her, and she battled desperate cravings to run and scream and break things.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="门闩随着咔嗒一声轻响闭合了，迪伦的心里好像炸开了一样。泪水模糊了视线，她泪眼蒙眬地跌跌撞撞穿过屋子，一直走到摸起来像是床的东西那里才停下。她扑倒在上面，恸哭失声，似乎整个人都被这哭泣压垮了。恐惧感包围着她，她在努力克制心里升起的一股强烈的渴望，想要冲出门外大喊大叫乱踢乱打一通。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They held, but continued to sputter because of the draft. Dylan turned and looked at the door. Closing it felt like closing her hope, and meant closing the door on Tristan. But she couldn't lose the fire. Feeling as if she was moving in slow motion, she rose and walked over to the door. She paused there, fighting a desire to run out into the night in a desperate attempt to find Tristan. That would mean surrendering herself to the demons, though, and Tristan wouldn't want that. Unable to watch, she shut her eyes, and then the door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="它们坚持了下来，但是在风中继续发出噼噼啪啪的声音。迪伦回身看着门，感觉关上大门就像关闭了希望，同时也意味着将崔斯坦挡在了门外，但她不能让这堆火熄灭。像电影慢镜头一样，她缓缓地站起身，朝门口一步步挪过去。她停在那儿，心里做着思想斗争，恨不得冲出门外，不顾一切地寻找崔斯坦。那就意味着把自己拱手献给恶魔们，崔斯坦也不想看到这样的事发生。没法再看下去了，她闭上了眼，关上了门。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh God, oh God, oh God," she repeated again and again in between gasping sobs. What was she going to do? Without Tristan she had no idea where she was going. She would get lost, wander till it was dark and then be a sitting duck for the demons. Or would she have to stay here, and wait? But who would come for her? If she didn't need to eat or drink, would she wait here for an eternity, like a cursed princess in some ridiculous fairy tale, hoping for a prince to come and rescue her?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，上帝啊，哦，上帝啊，哦，上帝啊！”她在啜泣的间隙一遍遍自语。她该怎么办？没有崔斯坦指引，她完全不知道自己该去向何方。她会迷路，在荒原上一直徘徊到夜幕降临，最后成为恶魔们轻易捕获的猎物。难道她就必须待在这里等着吗？谁又会来管她呢？如果她不需要吃喝的话，她是不是就要在这里一直待下去呢？就像荒唐的童话故事里那些受了诅咒的落难公主盼着王子来拯救自己？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And then other thoughts crept into her head. The loneliness and fear dragged up issues that hadn't had a chance to surface since the crash. Visions of Joan swam before her eyes. She imagined where she might be now, whether there had been a funeral held yet. In her mind's eye she pictured her mum receiving the call at the hospital, saw the devastated look on her face, her perfectly arched eyebrows crumpling as her hand reached up to cover her mouth, as if she could hold the truth out. Dylan thought of all the arguments they'd ever had, of all the mean things she'd said and never meant, and all the things she wanted to say and never had. Their last proper conversation had been a fight about seeing her dad. She could still remember telling her mother she was going to visit him, could remember the look on her face. Joan had stared at Dylan as if she'd betrayed her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着，她的脑海里又出现了别的事。孤独和恐惧让自从出事故以来一直没有机会想的那些事统统翻了上来。她的眼前浮现出琼的样子，她想象着她现在会在哪儿，自己的葬礼不知举行了没有。在想象中，她仿佛看到了妈妈接到医院传来的噩耗时的情景，看到了她脸上那种极度震惊的表情，看到她漂亮的弯眉皱成一团，手捂住了嘴，好像这样就能把事实隐瞒起来似的。迪伦想到了她们之间曾经的争吵，想到了她说过的那些有口无心的气人话，还有她想说却一直没说出口的话。她们俩最后一次像模像样的谈话竟然是一场吵架，争论她要不要去看爸爸。她还能想起来自己告诉母亲要去看他时，母亲脸上的表情—琼盯着迪伦，仿佛迪伦背叛了她。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">All of a sudden her situation, her death, hit home. It wasn't fair. How much could she be expected to lose? Her future, her family, her friends… all were gone. Now her ferryman, too? No, not just her ferryman. Tristan. Stolen away, just like everything else. Dylan didn't think she had any tears left, but as his face burst into her mind, more bubbled over, hot and salty on her cheeks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然间，迪伦想到了眼下的情形还有自己的死，一下子触到了伤心处。太不公平了。她这一死失去了多少东西啊？前途、家庭、朋友……全都没了。现在连她的灵魂摆渡人也离她而去了吗？不，崔斯坦不仅是她的摆渡人，他就像她生命中所有的一切那样悄然离去了。迪伦觉得自己的眼泪早就哭干了，但当他的脸在心头骤然浮现时，炽热而咸腥的泪水不住地顺着她的脸颊流淌。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was the longest night Dylan had ever endured. Every time she closed her eyes, haunting images flashed through her head: Joan, Tristan, a father figure who was terrifying without a face, flickers of the nightmare from the train. Slowly, sluggishly, it passed. The fire dimmed to an orange glow, and the dark outside dissolved into a soft light that filtered through the windows. The first rays of dawn chased away the colourless grey and brought life to the cottage, but Dylan didn't notice. She continued to stare at the logs in the fire till the warm colours of heat had dimmed to grey ash and the spent pieces of wood could do nothing but smoke softly in their grate. Her body seemed to have turned to stone. Her mind was shell-shocked, and took refuge in stupor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是迪伦经历过的最漫长的黑夜。她只要一闭上眼，各种挥之不去的景象就在脑海中闪现—琼、崔斯坦、没有脸的父亲那恐怖的模样，还有一闪而过的列车上的梦魇。夜缓慢而迟滞地过去了。壁炉里的火光变成了微弱的橙色火苗，屋外的黑暗也渐渐消散，一缕微光透过窗子渗了进来。初生的晨曦驱散了黯淡的灰色，给小屋添了些生气。可迪伦丝毫没有注意到这一切，她继续盯着炉中的木柴发呆，直到它们火热的暖色完全消散，变成一堆灰烬，燃尽的木头无可奈何地在炉栅里冒起了一阵青烟。她的身体石化般纹丝不动，她像是被战场上的炮弹声吓傻了似的，在麻木与呆滞中苟延残喘。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It took until mid-morning for her to realise that the light meant that she was free to escape her haven that was somehow also a prison. She could search for Tristan. What if he was lying somewhere in the valley, hurt and bleeding? What if he was waiting for her to come and find him?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="直到上午时分，她才意识到天亮意味着自己可以自由地跑出这个有点像监狱一样的避难所了，她可以去找崔斯坦。要是他躺在山谷的某个地方，身上受伤浑身流血怎么办？要是他一直在等她来救自己怎么办？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She eyed the door, still closed against the terrors of the wasteland. Tristan was out there, but so were the wraiths. Were the valley's shadows deep enough and dark enough for them to attack? Would the morning light be strong enough to keep her safe?</div>

<div class="line_en">Instead, the world had turned into many dazzling shades of red. The two hills remained, but now they were coated with burgundy dirt. There was no vegetation, but the steep sides were pierced with sharp, jagged rocks that burst from the ground in unique formations. The gravelled path had been replaced by a slick black walkway that looked like boiling tar. It appeared to be constantly undulating and bubbling as if it was alive.

<div class="line_en">But these were not the most frightening things. Gliding across the surface, climbing the hills and wandering up the pathway, were hundreds upon hundreds of what looked like… well, Dylan couldn't even find the words. They were human and yet looked formless, only the briefest outline identifying their age and gender. Dylan looked closely at the ones nearest to her. They seemed not to see her, not even to be aware that they were really there. They were intent on only one thing -- on following the brightly glowing orb that radiated in front of each of them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但这还不是最恐怖的事情。在路面上、山上、小路上，成千上万的东西在滑动、爬行、徘徊（好吧，迪伦简直找不到合适的词来形容他们的样子）。他们是人，看上去却又模模糊糊，只有一个非常粗略的轮廓能分辨出他们的年龄和性别。迪伦仔细盯着那些离自己最近的人形物，而他们似乎没有看到她，甚至连他们在哪个地方也浑然不觉。他们只专注于一件事—跟着那些照亮他们各自前路的那个闪光发亮的球体往前走。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Every figure was shadowed by a host of black spectres that hovered around their heads and circled in front of them. Dylan drew in a panicked breath as she watched them, fearful for each of the figures, but though the wraiths swirled in the air around them, they kept their distance. It was the orbs, she realised suddenly. The wraiths didn't want to get close to the pulsing balls of light, though where the shadows were heaviest she noticed they glowed less brightly and the demons dared to swoop more closely. Little cogs clicked into place at the back of her head as she stared.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每个人形物的头顶上空都笼罩着一团黑影，那是一群黑压压的恶鬼在他们周围和前方徘徊。迪伦看到它们时，不禁惊恐地倒吸了一口冷气，为这些人形物担心。不过，恶魔们虽然在他们周围盘旋，却始终保持一定的距离。她突然明白了，一定是那些球体在起作用。恶魔们不敢靠那些跳动的光球太近。然而她观察到，在阴影最浓重的地方那些光球的亮度就减弱了，魔鬼们这时就敢俯冲下来靠得更近。她痴痴地望着这一切，脑子里忽然一下子豁然开朗。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She was one of those things. This was the real wasteland. And Tristan was her orb. Without her orb, could she even step outside safely? If she left the safe house now could the demons attack her even though it was daytime? The only way to be sure was to step outside the protective charm of the cottage. Could she do that? She swayed gently in the doorway as she thought about it. No. Tilting out, she caught the hiss and wail of wraiths. That was enough. Horrified, she stepped back and slammed the door. She leaned her back against it, as if she could hold the wraiths at bay. Her strength lasted only a few more seconds before she sank to the ground, wrapped her hands around her legs, dropped her head to her knees and began to sob.</div>

<div class="line_en">After a brilliant sunset of oranges, reds and burgundies, the sky grew black. With the darkness came the whistling and screaming around the cottage. Dylan had long since lit the fire -- this time in the light with matches she had found on top of the mantelpiece. It had been a much longer process than the previous night, but finally she had coaxed the flame to grow and devour the twigs. Now the large logs had caught and it was crackling and spitting, providing warmth and comforting light. She had abandoned her post at the window.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="日落时分，橘红色、鲜红色和酒红色的余晖交织在一起，无比灿烂辉煌。之后，天开始黑下来。夜幕降临，呼啸声和尖叫声在小屋周围响起。迪伦早早就把炉火点着了—这次用的是她在壁炉架上方找到的火柴。这次点着火要比前一天晚上耗费更长的时间，但终于她还是引着了火苗。火吞噬了小树枝，大木柴也点着了，毕毕剥剥地爆响，带来了温暖和抚慰人心的光亮。她不再坐在窗边了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The thought of facing them again caused a trickle of sweat to slither down her back. She knew that she would not be able to walk outside today. It was still possible that Tristan was out there, trying to make his way back to her. She had to hold on to that hope. She could wait at least another day.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迪伦一想到要再次面对它们，后背就淌下冷汗来，她知道自己今天不能走到外面去了。崔斯坦可能还在奋力要从外面赶到她这里来，她必须保留着这点希望，至少她可以再等一天。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Minutes sauntered by, but after a while Dylan pulled herself together a little. She stood up and dragged a chair over to the window. She settled into it and leaned her head on her folded arms, which she rested against the windowsill. The view was the same as from the front door. A crimson desert dotted with drifting souls blindly following and being followed. It was mesmerising to watch. Seeing the demons still made her stomach churn, remembering the feel of their claws and the screaming in her ears.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="时间一分分慢慢地流逝。过了一会儿，迪伦稍稍振作了一些。她站起来，拽过一把椅子放在窗边。她在椅子上坐定，头压在交叠的胳膊上，胳膊靠着窗台。眼前的景象跟刚才在门口看到的别无二致，一片深红色的荒野上点缀着茫茫然移动的灵魂，既茫然跟随别人，又被别人茫然跟随，这一幕让人看得目瞪口呆。那些魔鬼的样子让她的胃里一阵翻江倒海，她又回想起了它们的利爪和回荡在耳边的尖叫。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The darkness frightened her, and she could not tell who was outside, watching her. Instead she lay on the bed and gazed at the flames till her eyes drooped as she slipped into semi-consciousness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黑暗让她感到恐怖，她分辨不清什么东西会在外面盯着她。她躺在床上，凝视着那火苗，直到眼皮慢慢垂下，人也滑入半梦半醒中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When she awoke hours later it was still pitch black outside. She looked up at the ceiling, and just for a few moments she could have been anywhere. In her cramped room at home, surrounded by posters of a certain film star and cuddly bears, or in a strange room in Aberdeen getting ready for another day of getting to know her dad. But she wasn't in either of these places. She was in a safe house. And she was dead. A steel band wrapped itself around her ribs. She couldn't breathe.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几个小时后她醒来时，外面依然一片漆黑。她盯着天花板，就在这片刻时间内，她的思绪可以飞到任何地方。她仿佛回到了在家中那间狭小的卧室里，周围是满墙的电影明星海报还有她的抱抱熊；又或是身处阿伯丁一间陌生的屋子里，准备好第二天来熟悉她的爸爸。但是现在，她不在这些地方。她躲在安全屋里，而且她已经死了。她的肋骨像是被钢圈箍紧了似的，让她连呼吸都很困难。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The cottage was warm. The fire that she had so carefully constructed still blazed in the grate and sent shadows dancing across the walls, but that wasn't what had pulled her from sleep. Turning over onto her side to watch the flames, she noticed the true reason for her waking. A figure was silhouetted against the light of the fire, unmoving. Fear flooded her and she froze, but as her eyes adjusted, the outline began to take shape, a familiar shape. A shape that Dylan had feared she would never see again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小屋里很暖和。她小心点燃的火仍在壁炉中燃烧，光影在墙上跳跃舞蹈，不过把她从睡眠中拉出来的不是这些黑影。她侧躺着注视着火苗，这才注意到自己醒来的真正原因。火光映衬着一个人影，他一动不动地立在那里，她顿时吓得身子木了半边。她定睛观瞧，那个人影开始变得清晰，是她熟悉的身影，是迪伦害怕再也见不到的身影。">查看中文翻译</div>
