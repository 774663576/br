<div class="line_en">Cool green light filtered down through the diamond-shaped panes of colored glass set in the sloping triangular walls, and a breeze was blowing gently through the terrace doors, carrying the scents of fruit and flowers from the garden beyond. "Your ears heard true," said Dany. "I want to buy them all. Tell the Good Masters, if you will."</div>

<div class="line_en">She had chosen a Qartheen gown today. The deep violet silk brought out the purple of her eyes. The cut of it bared her left breast. While the Good Masters of Astapor conferred among themselves in low voices, Dany sipped tart persimmon wine from a tall silver flute. She could not quite make out all that they were saying, but she could hear the greed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="今天她穿着魁尔斯长袍，深紫罗兰色的绸缎映衬紫色的眼睛，左边酥胸裸露出来。阿斯塔波的善主大人们在低声交谈，丹妮举起一只银色细高脚杯，啜饮酸柿酒。她听不清所有的话，但听得出其中的贪婪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Each of the eight brokers was attended by two or three body slaves… though one Grazdan, the eldest, had six. So as not to seem a beggar, Dany had brought her own attendants; Irri and Jhiqui in their sandsilk trousers and painted vests, old Whitebeard and mighty Belwas, her bloodriders. Ser Jorah stood behind her sweltering in his green surcoat with the black bear of Mormont embroidered upon it. The smell of his sweat was an earthy answer to the sweet perfumes that drenched the Astapori.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="八名商人各由两三名贴身奴隶服侍…其中最老的格拉兹旦带了六人。为不被看作乞丐，丹妮也带来自己的仆人：穿沙丝长裤和彩绘背心的伊丽与姬琪、老人白胡子和壮汉贝沃斯、还有血盟卫。乔拉爵士站在她身后，穿着绣有人立黑熊的绿外套，散发出朴实的汗臭，与阿斯塔波人浑身浸透的香水形成鲜明对比。">查看中文翻译</div>

"Of thousands, there are eight. is this what she means by all? There are also six centuries, who shall be part of a ninth thousand when complete. Would she have them too?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“全部！？”克拉兹尼·莫·纳克罗兹低吼道，他今天闻上去是桃子的味道。奴隶女孩用维斯特洛通用语把这个词重复了一遍。“若以千为单位，就是八千。她全部都要？此外还有六百，等凑齐一千就是九千。这些她也要？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Kraznys turned back to his fellows. once again they conferred among themselves. The translator had told Dany their names, but it was hard to keep them straight. Four of the men seemed to be named Grazdan, presumably after Grazdan the Great who had founded Old Ghis in the dawn of days. They all looked alike; thick fleshy men with amber skin, broad noses, dark eyes. Their wiry hair was black, or a dark red, or that queer mixture of red and black that was peculiar to Ghiscari. All wrapped themselves in tokars, a garment permitted only to freeborn men of Astapor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克拉兹尼又转向同伴们，再次商讨。翻译已把他们的名字告诉了丹妮，但她还记不精准。好像有四个格拉兹旦，想必是取自创世之初建立古吉斯帝国的“伟人”格拉兹旦。他们八个的长相都差不多：粗壮肥胖、琥珀色皮肤、宽鼻子、黑眼睛。直立的头发要么黑，要么暗红，要么就是红黑混杂——这是吉斯人的血统标志。他们都裹着托卡长袍，在阿斯塔波只有自由人才准穿这种服装。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dany let them argue, sipping the tart persimmon wine and trying to keep her face blank and ignorant. I will have them all, no matter the price, she told herself. The city had a hundred slave traders, but the eight before her were the greatest. When selling bed slaves, fieldhands, scribes, craftsmen, and tutors, these men were rivals, but their ancestors had allied one with the other for the purpose of making and selling the Unsullied. Brick and blood built Astapor, and brick and blood her people.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹妮任凭他们争论，自己啜饮酸柿酒，装作茫然无知。不管价钱多高，我都要全买下来，她告诉自己。这座城市有上百个奴隶商人，但此刻在她面前的八位最有影响力。售卖床上奴隶、农奴、文书、工匠或教师的时候，这些人是竞争对手，但在制造和出售无垢者方面，他们世世代代结成联盟。砖与血造就阿斯塔波，砖与血造就她的子民。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was the fringe on the tokar that proclaimed a man's status, Dany had been told by Captain Groleo. In this cool green room atop the pyramid, two of the slavers wore tokars fringed in silver, five had gold fringes, and one, the oldest Grazdan, displayed a fringe of fat white pearls that clacked together softly when he shifted in his seat or moved an arm.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="据格罗莱船长所言，托卡长袍上的流苏代表各自的地位。来到这间位于金字塔顶的荫凉休憩厅的奴隶商人中，有两个穿的托卡长袍带银流苏，五个带金流苏，最老的格拉兹旦的流苏则是大颗白珍珠。当他在椅子上挪移或摆动手臂，它们便互相撞击，发出轻微的嗒嗒声。">查看中文翻译</div>

I shall need the boys as replacements to take up the swords they drop." She put her wine aside and leaned toward the slave girl.

<div class="line_en">It was a long, dark, windy night that followed. Dany fed her dragons as she always did, but found she had no appetite herself. She cried awhile, alone in her cabin, then dried her tears long enough for yet another argument with Groleo.

Dany told them both to keep on with what they were doing, and went up on deck for a taste of the cool night air.

Today she rode her silver, clad in horsehair pants and painted leather vest, a bronze medallion belt about her waist and two more crossed between her breasts.

Ser Jorah Mormont was behind in mail and surcoat, glowering at anyone who came too near. Rakharo and Jhogo protected the litter. Dany had commanded that the top be removed, so her three dragons might be chained to the platform. Irri and Jhiqui rode with them, to try and keep them calm. Yet Viserion's tail lashed back and forth, and smoke rose angry from his nostrils. Rhaegal could sense something wrong as well.

<div class="line_en">I ought to have a banner sewn, she thought as she led her tattered band up along Astapor's meandering river. She closed her eyes to imagine how it would look: all flowing black silk, and on it the red three-headed dragon of Targaryen, breathing golden flames. A banner such as Rhaegar might have borne. The river's banks were strangely tranquil. The Worm, the Astapori called the stream. It was wide and slow and crooked, dotted with tiny wooded islands. She glimpsed children playing on one of them, darting amongst elegant marble statues. On another island two lovers kissed in the shade of tall green trees, with no more shame than Dothraki at a wedding. Without clothing, she could not tell if they were slave or free.</div>

There were no bronze statues here; only a wooden platform where rebellious slaves were racked, and flayed, and hanged.

<div class="line_en">Kraznys mo Nakloz and his fellows were all there to greet her. Other well-born Astapori stood in knots behind them, sipping wine from silver flutes as slaves circulated among them with trays of olives and cherries and figs. The elder Grazdan sat in a sedan chair supported by four huge copper-skinned slaves. Half a dozen mounted lancers rode along the edges of the plaza, keeping back the crowds who had come to watch. The sun flashed blinding bright off the polished copper disks sewn to their cloaks, but she could not help but notice how nervous their horses seemed. They fear the dragons. And well they might.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克拉兹尼·莫·纳克罗兹和他的同伴们在此恭候。其他出生高贵的阿斯塔波人也一簇簇站在大奴隶商人们身后，从银色细高脚杯里啜饮红酒，奴隶在他们中间穿梭，捧着盘盘橄榄、樱桃和无花果。年长的格拉兹旦坐在轿子里，由四名古铜色皮肤的高大奴隶抬着。六个枪骑兵沿广场边缘巡逻，挡住围观的人群。他们的黄丝披风上缝有许多闪亮铜盘，反射出明亮炫目的阳光，但她注意到他们的紧张。他们怕龙。真龙不怕他们。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At first glimpse, Dany thought their skin was striped like the zorses of the jogos Nhai. Then she rode her silver nearer and saw the raw red flesh beneath the crawling black stripes. Flies. Flies and maggots. The rebellious slaves had been peeled like a man might peel an apple, in a long curling strip. One man had an arm black with flies from fingers to elbow, and red and white beneath. Dany reined in beneath him. "What did this one do?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乍看一眼，丹妮以为那上面的奴隶有跟鸠格斯奈的斑纹马一样的皮肤，随着银马骑近，才发现蠕动的黑斑纹下是鲜红的生肉。苍蝇。苍蝇和蛆虫。如削苹果似地，反叛奴隶的皮肤被长长卷曲、一缕缕地剥下。有个人一条胳膊从手指到肘部爬满黑色的苍蝇，底下则是红色与白色。丹妮在他下方勒住缰绳，“这人干了什么？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her stomach roiling, Dany wheeled her silver about and trotted toward the center of the plaza, and the army she had bought so dear. Rank on rank on rank they stood, her stone halfmen with their hearts of brick; eight thousand and six hundred in the spiked bronze caps of fully trained Unsullied, and five thousand odd behind them, bareheaded, yet armed with spears and shortswords. The ones farthest to the back were only boys, she saw, but they stood as straight and still as all the rest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹妮的胃阵阵翻搅，连忙圈转银马，朝广场中央那支昂贵的军队奔去。他们一排一排又一排地站立着，个个都是没有人性的石头，是她的砖头太监。总共八千六百个经过完整训练、赢得尖刺盔的无垢者，外加五千多光着脑袋，装备长矛和短剑的受训者。她看到远方最后面的那些不过是孩子，但跟其他人一样站得笔直，纹丝不动。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">While the payment was being made, Kraznys mo Nakloz favored her with a few final words on the handling of her troops. "They are green as yet," he said through Missandei. "Tell the whore of Westeros she would be wise to blood them early. There are many small cities between here and there, cities ripe for sacking. Whatever plunder she takes will be hers alone. Unsullied have no lust for gold or gems. And should she take captives, a few guards will suffice to march them back to Astapor. We'll buy the healthy ones, and for a good price. And who knows? In ten years, some of the boys she sends us may be Unsullied in their turn. Thus all shall prosper."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="交付过程中，克拉兹尼·莫·纳克罗兹最后一次嘱咐她如何约束部队。“他们还很嫩，”他通过弥桑黛说，“告诉维斯特洛婊子，聪明的话就先让他们获得一些作战经验。此去西方，路上有许多小城市，很适合洗劫，不管取得什么战利品，都可以全部收归己有，因为无垢者对金钱和珠宝没有欲望。抓获的俘虏，靠一队护卫就能押回阿斯塔波。我们会买下其中健康的，价格从优。谁知道呢？也许十年之后，她给我们送来的男孩会继而成为无垢者，形成良性循环。这样对大家都有好处。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Finally there were no more trade goods to add to the pile. Her Dothraki mounted their horses once more, and Dany said, "This was all we could carry.

<div class="line_en">"There is a reason. A dragon is no slave." And Dany swept the lash down as hard as she could across the slaver's face. Kraznys screamed and staggered back, the blood running red down his cheeks into his perfumed beard. The harpy's fingers had tom his features half to pieces with one slash, but she did not pause to contemplate the ruin. "Drogon," she sang out loudly, sweetly, all her fear forgotten. "Dracarys."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那当然。真龙不是奴隶。”丹妮使尽全力用鞭抽向奴隶商人的脸。克拉兹尼尖叫着蹒跚着往后退去，鲜红的血从脸颊淌下，渗进洒了香水的胡子里。鹰身女妖之指将他的面目一下子撕成碎片，但她没有注足细看。“卓耿，”她亲切地大喊，忘记了所有恐惧，“dracarys！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A lance of swirling dark flame took Kraznys full in the face. His eyes melted and ran down his cheeks, and the oil in his hair and beard burst so fiercely into fire that for an instant the slaver wore a burning crown twice as tall as his head.

<div class="line_cn" title="一道黑色的火焰旋转着直扑向克拉兹尼的面门，熔化了眼睛，果冻般的一团滑下面庞，头发和胡子里的油猛烈燃烧，刹那间，奴隶商人好似戴上了一顶燃烧的冠冕，足有他脑袋两倍之高。焦臭肉味盖过香气，而他的嚎叫淹没了所有声响。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then the Plaza of Punishment blew apart into blood and chaos. The Good Masters were shrieking, stumbling, shoving one another aside and tripping over the fringes of their tokars in their haste. Drogon flew almost lazily at Kraznys, black wings beating. As he gave the slaver another taste of fire, Irri and Jhiqui unchained Viserion and Rhaegal, and suddenly there were three dragons in the air. When Dany turned to look, a third of Astapor's proud demon-homed warriors were fighting to stay atop their terrified mounts, and another third were fleeing in a bright blaze of shiny copper. One man kept his saddle long enough to draw a sword, but Jhogo's whip coiled about his neck and cut off his shout. Another lost a hand to Rakharo's arakh and rode off reeling and spurting blood. Aggo sat calmly notching arrows to his bowstring and sending them at tokars. Silver, gold, or plain, he cared nothing for the fringe. Strong Belwas had his arakh out as well, and he spun it as he charged.</div>
