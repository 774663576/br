<div class="line_en">The next morning was bright, clear and sunny. I woke up with a motorman's glove in my mouth, drank two cups of coffee and went through the morning papers. I didn't find any reference to Mr. Arthur Gwynn Geiger in either of them. I was shaking the wrinkles out of my damp suit when the phone rang. It was Bernie Ohls, the D.

<div class="line_en">Shaved, dressed and lightly breakfasted I was at the Hall of Justice in less than an hour. I rode up to the seventh floor and went along to the group of small offices used by the D. A.'s men. Ohls' was no larger than the others, but he had it to himself. There was nothing on his desk but a blotter, a cheap pen set, his hat and one of his feet. He was a medium-sized blondish man with stiff white eyebrows, calm eyes and well-kept teeth. He looked like anybody you would pass on the street. I happened to know he had killed nine men -- three of them when he was covered, or somebody thought he was.</div>

<div class="line_en">He fixed the lock on his door and we went down to the official parking lot and got into a small blue sedan. We drove out Sunset, using the siren once in a while to beat a signal. It was a crisp morning, with just enough snap in the air to make life seem simple and sweet, if you didn't have too much on your mind. I had.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他锁好办公室门，我们下楼走进法院的停车场，上了一辆蓝色小轿车。我们驶出日落大道，不时碰到红灯便鸣警笛冲过去。那是个凉爽的早晨，空气里的寒意恰如其分，让生活显得简单又甜蜜，如果你没有太多心事的话。但我有。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was thirty miles to Lido on the coast highway, the first ten of them through traffic. Ohls made the run in three quarters of an hour. At the end of that time we skidded to a stop in front of a faded stucco arch and I took my feet out of the floorboards and we got out. A long pier railed with white two-by-fours stretched seaward from the arch. A knot of people leaned out at the far end and a motorcycle officer stood under the arch keeping another group of people from going out on the pier. Cars were parked on both sides of the highway, the usual ghouls, of both sexes. Ohls showed the motorcycle officer his badge and we went out on the pier, into a loud fish smell which one night's hard rain hadn't even dented.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="沿海岸边的高速公路走上三十英里就能到达里多，前十英里往来车辆比较多。这段路奥尔斯开了四十五分钟。最后我们在一座褪色的灰泥拱门前刹了车，我把腿迈出车厢，同他走下车。安有“二英寸乘以四英寸”[2]白色栏杆的狭长码头从拱门一路向大海伸展开去。一群人在远端探身看着什么，有个摩托骑警站在拱门下面，拦住要冲上码头的另一群人。公路两旁都停着车，这一众热衷观赏惨剧的人，有男也有女。奥尔斯向骑警出示了警徽，我俩走上码头。下了一晚上的雨，那股扑鼻的鱼腥味还是臭气熏天，丝毫没有变淡。【注：[2]two—by—four：指截面为2英寸×4英寸的木材。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ohls said hello to a deputy in green khaki and a man in plain clothes. The barge crew of three men leaned against the front of the wheelhouse and chewed tobacco. One of them was rubbing at his wet hair with a dirty bath-towel. That would be the man who had gone down into the water to put the chains on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="奥尔斯跟一个身穿绿色卡其布制服的警长和一个便衣男子打了招呼。驳船上的三个船员靠在驾驶舱前，咀嚼着烟草。其中一人正用一条肮脏的浴巾擦着湿头发。应该就是他跳进水里给车绑上吊索的。">查看中文翻译</div>

Something that glistened in the morning sunlight was on its deck, with hoist chains still around it, a large black and chromium car. The arm of the hoist had been swung back into position and lowered to deck level. Men stood around the car. We went down slippery steps to the deck.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Went through there. Must have hit pretty hard. The rain stopped early down here, around nine p. m. The broken wood's dry inside. That puts it after the rain stopped. She fell in plenty of water not to be banged up worse, not more than half tide or she'd have drifted farther, and not more than half tide going out or she'd have crowded the piles. That makes it around ten last night. Maybe nine-thirty, not earlier. She shows under the water when the boys come down to fish this morning, so we get the barge to hoist her out and we find the dead guy."</div>

<div class="line_en">The driver was still draped around the steering post with his head at an unnatural angle to his shoulders. He was a slim dark-haired kid who had been good-looking not so long ago. Now his face was bluish white and his eyes were a faint dull gleam under the lowered lids and his open mouth had sand in it. On the left side of his forehead there was a dull bruise that stood out against the whiteness of the skin.</div>

First off the guy plowed an awful straight furrow down that pier. You can read his tread marks all the way nearly. That puts it after the rain like the Sheriff said. Then he hit the pier hard and clean or he don't go through and land right side up. More likely turned over a couple of times. So he had plenty of speed and hit the rail square. That's more than half-throttle. He could have done that with his hand falling and he could have hurt his head falling too."</div>

<div class="line_en">We went back along the pier and got into Ohls' sedan again. He wrestled it around on the highway and drove back towards town along a three-lane highway washed clean by the rain, past low rolling hills of yellow-white sand terraced with pink moss. Seaward a few gulls wheeled and swooped over something in the surf and far out a white yacht looked as if it was hanging in the sky.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们沿码头原路返回，再次上了奥尔斯的车。他在高速公路上吃力地调了个头，顺着一条被雨洗净的三车道公路返城。连绵起伏的山丘掠过两旁，黄白相间的沙土上长满一重重粉色的苔藓。海那边，几只海鸥在空中盘旋，突然猛扑向浪花上的什么东西；很远处有艘游艇，仿佛悬挂在天际。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Owen Taylor. How do I know? Funny about that. About a year or so back we had him in the cooler on a Mann Act rap. It seems he run Sternwood's hotcha daughter, the young one, off to Yuma. The sister ran after them and brought them back and had Owen heaved into the icebox. Then next day she comes down to the D. A. and gets him to beg the kid off with the U. S. 'cutor. She says the kid meant to marry her sister and wanted to, only the sister can't see it. All she wanted was to kick a few high ones off the bar and have herself a party. So we let the kid go and then darned if they don't have him come back to work. And a little later we get the routine report on his prints from Washington, and he's got a prior back in Indiana, attempted hold-up six years ago. He got off with six months in the county jail, the very one Dillinger bust out of. We hand that to the Sternwoods and they keep him on just the same. What do you think of that?"</div>
