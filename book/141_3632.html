From this point it described a long curve, descending towards Bitter Creek Valley, to rise again to the dividing ridge of the waters between the Atlantic and the Pacific. There were many creeks in this mountainous region, and it was necessary to cross Muddy Creek, Green Creek, and others, upon culverts.</div>

<div class="line_en">The train, on leaving Great Salt Lake at Ogden, passed northward for an hour as far as Weber River, having completed nearly nine hundred miles from San Francisco. From this point it took an easterly direction towards the jagged Wahsatch Mountains. It was in the section included between this range and the Rocky Mountains that the American engineers found the most formidable difficulties in laying the road, and that the government granted a subsidy of forty-eight thousand dollars per mile, instead of sixteen thousand allowed for the work done on the plains. But the engineers, instead of violating nature, avoided its difficulties by winding around, instead of penetrating the rocks. One tunnel only, fourteen thousand feet in length, was pierced in order to arrive at the great basin.</div>

<div class="line_en">Several passengers had got off at Green River, and were walking up and down the platforms; and among these Aouda recognised Colonel Stamp Proctor, the same who had so grossly insulted Phileas Fogg at the San Francisco meeting. Not wishing to be recognised, the young woman drew back from the window, feeling much alarm at her discovery. She was attached to the man who, however coldly, gave her daily evidences of the most absolute devotion. She did not comprehend, perhaps, the depth of the sentiment with which her protector inspired her, which she called gratitude, but which, though she was unconscious of it, was really more than that. Her heart sank within her when she recognised the man whom Mr. Fogg desired, sooner or later, to call to account for his conduct. Chance alone, it was clear, had brought Colonel Proctor on this train; but there he was, and it was necessary, at all hazards, that Phileas Fogg should not perceive his adversary.</div>

<div class="line_en">Passepartout felt something like a shudder shoot through his frame, but his confidence in his master remained unbroken. Was there any means of detaining Mr. Fogg in the car, to avoid a meeting between him and the colonel? It ought not to be a difficult task, since that gentleman was naturally sedentary and little curious. The detective, at least, seemed to have found a way; for, after a few moments, he said to Mr. Fogg, "These are long and slow hours, sir, that we are passing on the railway."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="路路通听了这话好象身上打了一个冷颤，但是，他对福克先生的信心却毫不动摇。可是，现在有什么办法把福克先生留在车厢里不让他跟那个上校碰头呢？这也许不难，团为这位绅士生性就是个不爱活动不爱看热闹的人。最后费克斯认为自己已经找到了一个好办法。待不多久，他就对斐利亚·福克说：“先生，咱们这样坐在火车上，时间过得真是又长又慢啊。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a general disappointment among the passengers, who, without reckoning the delay, saw themselves compelled to trudge fifteen miles over a plain covered with snow. They grumbled and protested, and would certainly have thus attracted Phileas Fogg's attention if he had not been completely absorbed in his game.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此外，所有的旅客也都感到很丧气，耽搁时间暂且不说，旅客还得在这冰天雪地里步行十五六英里。所以，叫喊声和咒骂声乱成了一片，斐利亚·福克要不是一心在玩“惠司脱”的话，这些叫声准会引起他的注意。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But a number of the passengers were at once attracted by the engineer's proposal, and Colonel Proctor was especially delighted, and found the plan a very feasible one. He told stories about engineers leaping their trains over rivers without bridges, by putting on full steam; and many of those present avowed themselves of the engineer's mind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，立刻就有些旅客对这个建议随声附和表示同意，尤其是普洛克托上校特别拥护这个办法，这个冒失鬼，他觉得完全可以这么干。他甚至还告诉大家说，有些工程师还想过用高速度直线奔驰的办法使火车从“没有桥”的河上飞过去，他还讲了另外一些类似的怪事。说到最后，所有关心这个问题的人都同意了司机的高见。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The locomotive whistled vigorously; the engineer, reversing the steam, backed the train for nearly a mile -- retiring, like a jumper, in order to take a longer leap. Then, with another whistle, he began to move forward; the train increased its speed, and soon its rapidity became frightful; a prolonged screech issued from the locomotive; the piston worked up and down twenty strokes to the second. They perceived that the whole train, rushing on at the rate of a hundred miles an hour, hardly bore upon the rails at all.</div>

<div class="line_en">And they passed over! It was like a flash. No one saw the bridge. The train leaped, so to speak, from one bank to the other, and the engineer could not stop it until it had gone five miles beyond the station. But scarcely had the train passed the river, when the bridge, completely ruined, fell with a crash into the rapids of Medicine Bow.</div>
