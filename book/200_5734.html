<div class="line_en">Ron's euphoria at helping Gryffindor scrape the Quidditch cup was such that he couldn't settle to anything next day. All he wanted to do was talk over the match, so Harry and Hermione found it very difficult to find an opening in which to mention Grawp. Not that either of them tried very hard; neither was keen to be the one to bring Ron back to reality in quite such a brutal fashion. As it was another fine, warm day, they persuaded him to join them in revising under the beech tree at the edge of the lake, where they had less chance of being overheard than in the common room. Ron was not particularly keen on this idea at first -- he was thoroughly enjoying being patted on the back by every Gryffindor who walked past his chair, not to mention the occasional outbursts of "Weasley is our King'-- but after a while he agreed that some fresh air might do him good.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'm not," said Harry quickly, and looked down at his Transfiguration notes, attempting to straighten his lace. The truth was that Ron had just reminded Harry forcibly of another Gryffindor Quidditch player who had once sat rumpling his hair under this very tree. "I'm just glad we won, that's all."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我没笑。”哈利赶紧说，然后低头看着自己的变形课笔记，想把面孔板起来。其实刚才罗恩让哈利不禁想起了另一个格兰芬多魁地奇球队员，以前他也是坐在这棵树下弄乱自己的头发。“我只是为我们打赢了比赛感到高兴，没别的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, I mean, I'd already let in that one of Davies's, so I wasn't feeling all that confident, but I dunno, when Bradley came towards me, just out of nowhere, I thought -- you can do this! And I had about a second to decide which way to fly, you know, because he looked like he was aiming for the right goalhoop -- my right, obviously, his left -- but I had a funny feeling that he was feinting, and so I took the chance and flew left -- his right, I mean -- and -- well -- you saw what happened," he concluded modestly, sweeping his hair back quite unnecessarily so that it looked interestingly windswept and glancing around to see whether the people nearest to them -- a bunch of gossiping third-year Hufflepuffs -- had heard him. "And then, when Chambers came at me about five minutes later -- What?" Ron asked, having stopped mid-sentence at the look on Harry's face. "Why are you grinning?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嗯，我的意思是，我已经漏掉了戴维斯的一个球，所以没那么有信心了，可我也不知道是怎么回事，布拉德利不知从什么地方朝我冲过来时，我心里想——你能做到！我大概用了一秒钟时间决定该往哪边飞，你知道，他看上去好像在瞄准右边的圆环——是我的右边，当然也就是他的左边——但是我心里怪怪的，觉碍他是在做假动作，所以我冒了个险朝左边飞去——也就是他的右边，我是说——然后——嗯——后来的情况你们都看到了。”他谦虚地停止了描述，多此一举地把头发拢到脑后，好像足头发被风吹了个乱七八糟，看上去挺引人注目的；他还朝四下里扫了一眼，看看最近的那些人——一群正在闲聊的三年级赫奇帕奇学生——有没有听到自己刚才那番话。“接着，大约五分钟后钱伯斯朝我攻上来时——你怎么了？”罗恩问，看见哈利脸上的表情后，他只讲了一半就打住了，“你在笑什么啊？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊，”赫敏烦躁地说，翻开一页《中级变形术》，瞪着书里的一连串图解，里面演示出一只猫头鹰如何变成了一副小型望远镜，“是啊，我开始也觉得他疯了。但是，很不幸，他说服了哈利和我。”">查看中文翻译</div>

June had arrived, but to the fifth-years this meant only one thing: their OWLs were upon them at last.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well," he sighed, "Hagrid hasn't been sacked yet, has he? He's hung on this long, maybe he'll hang on till the end of term and we won't have to go near Grawp at all."</div>

<div class="line_en">Their teachers were no longer setting them homework; lessons were devoted to revising those topics the teachers thought most likely to come up in the exams. The purposeful, feverish atmosphere drove nearly everything but the OWLs from Harry's mind, though he did wonder occasionally during Potions lessons whether Lupin had ever told Snape that he must continue giving Harry Ooclumency tuition. If he had, then Snape had ignored Lupin as thoroughly as he was now ignoring Harry. This suited Harry very well; he was quite busy and tense enough without extra classes with Snape, and to his relief Hermione was much too preoccupied these days to badger him about Occlumency; she was spending a lot of time muttering to herself, and had not laid out any elf clothes for days.</div>

All was quiet except for the rustle of parchment, the occasional creak of a telescope as it was adjusted on its stand, and the scribbling of many quills.

<div class="line_en">Harry put his eye back to his telescope and refocused it, now examining Venus. He looked down at his chart to enter the planet there, but something distracted him; pausing with his quill suspended over the parchment, he squinted down into the shadowy grounds and saw half a dozen figures walking over the lawn. If they had not been moving, and the moonlight had not been gilding the tops of their heads, they would have been indistinguishable from the dark ground on which they walked. Even at this distance, Harry had a funny feeling he recognised the walk of the squattest of them, who seemed to be leading the group.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在哈利又把眼睛贴近望远镜，重新调整了一下焦距观察金星。他低头看着自己的星象图，准备把金星的位置记上去，但是有东西分散了他的注意力；手里的羽毛笔悬在羊皮纸上空停了下来，他眯起眼睛望着下面幽暗的场地，看到六个身影正走过草地。如果他们没有走动，如果月光没有照亮他们的头顶，那么在漆黑的场地上他们是不容易被发现的。虽然离得这么远，可哈利还是奠名其妙地感到，自己认出了那些人当中最矮胖的那个人的走路姿势，那个人好像在带领着这个队伍。">查看中文翻译</div>
