<div class="line_en">Tully should have gone straight home and tried to forget the whole thing, but by the time the ferry pulled back into downtown Seattle, she was a wreck. Instead of turning left on Alaskan Way, she turned right and hit the gas.</div>

<div class="line_en">None of it mattered much to her; what changed, what stayed the same… she didn't care. Even under the best of circumstances, she was only barely connected to the yesterdays of her life, and tonight was far from the best of circumstances. Still, when she turned onto Firefly Lane, it was like rocketing into the past.</div>

<div class="line_en">She turned onto the paved driveway and drove up to the small white farmhouse with the glossy black trim. Over the years Mrs. Mularkey had turned the ragged yard into an English-style garden full of flowers. In this late autumn, the whole garden seemed to glow golden. The yard and hanging baskets were a riot of red geraniums, visible in the orangey porch light.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她开上车道，来到有着光亮黑色门窗的白色小农庄前。穆勒齐伯母花了几年的工夫，将原本不起眼的前院变成英式花园，在这个晚秋时节，整个花园仿佛镀上一层金，花圃与悬挂式花盆开满艳红的天竺葵，在门廊的橘色灯光下争奇斗艳。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr. M. answered, and for a second there, standing on the porch, looking up at him, Tully felt her whole life flash before her eyes. He looked older, of course, with a vanishing hairline and an expanding waistline, but dressed as he was in a white T-shirt and worn jeans, he looked so much like he used to that she felt young again, too. "Hey, Mr. M."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="穆勒齐伯父来开门，塔莉站在门廊上抬头看他，刹那间，人生闪过她眼前。他虽然老了，发线后退，腰围增加，但那身白Ｔ恤配旧牛仔裤的装扮和当年如出一辙，塔莉觉得自己也回到了从前，“嗨，伯父。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In no time, Mrs. M. came down the stairs, zipping up the red velour robe she'd worn for as long as Tully had known her. No matter how many expensive robe-and-nightgown sets Tully sent Mrs. M. over the years, this old red one remained her favorite. "Tully," she said, pulling off her big beige-rimmed bifocals. "Is everything okay?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没多久，穆勒齐伯母下楼来，边走边拉起睡袍的拉链，打从塔莉认识她起，这件红丝绒睡袍便一直都在。塔莉这些年送了不少高级睡衣、睡袍，穆勒齐伯母却始终最爱这一件。“塔莉。”她摘下米白框的双焦距大眼镜，“你没事吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mrs. M. went straight to the wet bar in the living room -- an addition in the late eighties -- and poured two glasses of wine. Handing one to Tully, she led the way into the living room and sat down on the new leopard-print sofa. Behind their heads the wall was full of family photos now. Jesus and Elvis still held center stage, but around them were dozens of school photos of Marah and the twins; Johnny and Kate's wedding pictures; Sean's graduate school graduation photos; and a few here and there of Tully. "Okay, what's the problem?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="穆勒齐伯母直接走向客厅的小酒吧倒了两杯红酒，这是80年代末期增添的小花样。她将一杯递给塔莉，带头走向客厅，坐在豹纹新沙发上。她们身后的墙上挂满了家族照片，耶稣与猫王依然占据中心位置，但旁边围绕着数十张照片：玛拉和双胞胎、强尼与凯蒂的婚礼、尚恩的研究所毕业照，还有几张塔莉的照片穿插其中，“好了，究竟怎么回事？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sounds were clearer here by the water as well. Maple leaves turned color and fell from the nearby trees, landing like quickened footsteps on the marshy ground; squirrels scurried from branch to branch, no doubt gathering their food for a cold they sensed was drawing near, and as always there was the tide, moving forward and back against the shore with a rhythm connected to the faraway moon. Here, on her back porch, only the seasons changed, and each gave the landscape an amazing new look.</div>

<div class="line_en">Kate never tired of the view from her own back porch. Tonight, on this crisp late October evening, the sky above Seattle was an endless, star-filled black.

Her teenage daughter was sprouting like a tree, blooming every day into another variation of who she would someday become. Moods twisted her up and left her looking sometimes like a girl who'd just washed up onshore, unable to quite remember who she was and who she wanted to be.</div>

<div class="line_en">No wonder Tully had so many sharp angles and harsh edges; she'd never let herself be softened by love, wrapped up in it. Without kids or a husband or a mother's love, she'd grown selfish. And so, yet again, Kate would let go of her anger without an apology. She shouldn't have let it simmer so long anyway. It was remarkable how quickly time passed. Sometimes it felt as if they'd just had the blowup. What mattered now was not the words, spoken or withheld, but rather the years of friendship.</div>

<div class="line_en">Kate sighed and glanced in the rearview mirror. The twins were playing together in the backseat, making their plastic dinosaurs fight. "Girls," she whispered under her breath, wondering why it was that adolescent girls simply had to be mean to their mothers.

Maybe the species needed girls who thought they were grown up at thirteen for some bizarre, hidden reason.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Welcome back to The Girlfriend Hour," she was saying now, trying to be heard over the din of applause. Kate knew that people sometimes stood in line for six hours to be in the studio audience, and why not? The Hour, as it was called by fans and media alike now, was fun and breezy and occasionally even inspiring. No one ever quite knew what Tully would say or do next. It was part of what kept people tuning in, and Johnny made sure that everything ran like a well-oiled machine. True to her word, Tully had made them all rich, and Johnny, in turn, always made Tully look good.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“欢迎收看《私房话时间》。”她提高音量，努力压过如雷的掌声。粉丝昵称这个节目为“私房话”，现在媒体也这样用了。凯蒂知道有些观众为了入场不惜排队六个小时，那一点也不奇怪，因为节目内容轻松有趣，偶尔也能发人深省。塔莉总是出人意料，没人猜得到她接下来要说什么、做什么，这是吸引观众每天收看的因素之一。在强尼的努力下，节目运作如同上足了油的机器般顺畅。塔莉说过会让所有人发财，她确实做到了，而强尼的回报则是永远让塔莉光鲜亮丽。">查看中文翻译</div>

Last year she'd decided to let her hair grow out into a sleek shoulder-length bob, and she'd returned to her natural reddish-brown color. The sophisticated girl-next-door cut and color only emphasized her high cheekbones and chocolaty eyes. A few well-placed shots of collagen had given her perfect lips, which she coated in just a hint of gloss but almost no color.</div>

Dozens of people had been working for months to make it the event of the year in Seattle. Not only were the locals expected to attend, but the RSVPs indicated a celebrity-studded night.

<div class="line_cn" title="她环顾四周，奥林匹克饭店的宴会厅老派而璀璨，饭店最近好像改名字了，但她记不得新名称，这些连锁饭店买卖太频繁，反正对西雅图居民而言，这里永远是奥林匹克饭店。">查看中文翻译</div>
