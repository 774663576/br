<div class="line_en">When she opened her eyes in the morning it was because a young housemaid had come into her room to light the fire and was kneeling on the hearth-rug raking out the cinders noisily. Mary lay and watched her fora few moments and then began to look about the room. She had never seen a room at all like it and thought it curious and gloomy. The walls were covered with tapestry with a forest scene embroidered on it. There were fantastically dressed people under the trees and in the distance there was a glimpse of the turrets of a castle. There were hunters and horses and dogs and ladies. Mary felt as if she were in the forest with them. Out of a deep window she could see a great climbing stretch of land which seemed to have no trees on it, and to look rather like an endless, dull, purplish sea.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Aye, that I do," answered Martha, cheerfully polishing away at the grate. "I just love it. It's none bare. It's covered wi' growin' things as smells sweet. It's fair lovely in spring an' summer when th' gorse an'broom an' heather's in flower. It smells of honey an'there's such a lot of fresh air-an' th' sky looks so high an' th' bees an' skylarks makes such a nice noise hummin' an' singin'. Eh!

<div class="line_en">Mary listened to her with a grave, puzzled expression. The native servants she had been used to in India were not in the least like this. They were obsequious and servile and did not presume to talk to their masters as if they were their equals. They made salaams and called them "protector of the poor" and names of that sort. Indian servants were commanded to do things, not asked. It was not the custom to say "please" and "thank you'and Mary had always slapped her Ayah in the face when she was angry. She wondered a little what this girl would do if one slapped her in the face. She was a round, rosy, good-natured-looking creature, but she had a sturdy way which made Mistress Mary wonder if she might not even slap back-if the person who slapped her was only a little girl.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽听着，表情阴暗而困惑。这和她习惯的印度仆人完全两回事。他们像奴隶一样谦卑巴结，不敢和主人讲话。他们向主人行一种弯腰额手的礼，称主人是“穷人的保护者”之类。印度仆人做事是被命令，不是请求。那里不习惯说“请”和“谢谢”，玛丽生气的时候总是搧奶妈脸。她稍微捉摸了一下，如果有谁搧这个姑娘，她会什么反应。她是个圆滚滚，玫瑰色，模样好心的生灵，可是她有一种坚强的态度，让玛丽小姐推测她甚至会搧回去——要是搧她的人只是个小女孩儿的话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Eh! I know that," she said. "If there was a grand Missusat Misselthwaite I should never have been even one of th' under house-maids. I might have been let to be scullery maid but I'd never have been let upstairs. I'm too common an' I talk too much Yorkshire. But this is a funny house for all it's so grand. Seems like there's neither Master nor Mistress except Mr. Pitcher an' Mrs. Medlock. Mr. Craven, he won't be troubled about anythin' when he's here, an' he's nearly always away.

<div class="line_en">It had not been the custom that Mistress Mary should do anything but stand and allow herself to be dressed like a doll, but before she was ready for breakfast she began to suspect that her life at Misselthwaite Manor would end by teaching her a number of things quite new to her -- things such as putting on her own shoes and stockings, and picking up things she let fall. If Martha had been a well-trained fine young lady's maid she would have been more subservient and respectful and would have known that it was her business to brush hair, and button boots, and pick things up and lay them away. She was, however, only an untrained Yorkshire rustic who had been brought up in a moorland cottage with a swarm of little brothers and sisters who had never dreamed of doing anything but waiting on themselves and on the younger ones who were either babies in arms or just learning to totter about and tumble over things.</div>

When she went into the room which had been made into a nursery for her, she found that it was rather like the one she had slept in. It was not a child's room, but a grown-up person's room, with gloomy old pictures on the walls and heavy old oak chairs. A table in the center was set with a good substantial breakfast. But she had always had a very small appetite, and she looked with something more than indifference at the first plate Martha set before her.</div>

She wondered what it would look like and whether there were any flowers still alive in it. When she had passed through the shrubbery gate she found herself in great gardens, with wide lawns and winding walks with clipped borders. There were trees, and flower-beds, and evergreens clipped into strange shapes, and a large pool with an old gray fountain in its midst. But the flower-beds were bare and wintry and the fountain was not playing. This was not the garden which was shut up. How could a garden be shut up? You could always walk into a garden.</div>

<div class="line_en">She was just thinking this when she saw that, at the end of the path she was following, there seemed to be along wall, with ivy growing over it. She was not familiar enough with England to know that she was coming upon the kitchen-gardens where the vegetables and fruit were growing. She went toward the wall and found that there was a green door in the ivy, and that it stood open. This was not the closed garden, evidently, and she could go into it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她正这么想着，就看见在脚下的这条小路尽头，似乎有一道长长的墙，长满了常春藤。她对英格兰还不够熟，不知道她遇到了菜园，用来种蔬菜和水果。她向墙走去，常春藤中有一道门，打开着。显然不是那个上锁的花园，她可以进去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She went through the door and found that it was a garden with walls all round it and that it was only one of several walled gardens which seemed to open into one another. She saw another open green door, revealing bushes and pathways between beds containing winter vegetables. Fruit-trees were trained flat against the wall, and over some of the beds there were glass frames. The place was bare and ugly enough, Mary thought, as she stood and stared about her. It might be nicer in summer when things were green, but there was nothing pretty about it now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她穿过门，发现一个四周围着墙的花园，而且这只是几个有墙的花园之一，几个花园的门似乎互通着。她看到另一扇打开的绿门，露出灌木和花床间的小径，花床上种着冬季蔬菜。果树枝条被驯成一片，平坦地贴着墙。一些花床盖着玻璃罩。这地方可真够光秃丑陋的，玛丽想，站在那里目不转睛地环顾着。夏天有绿色，也许能好看些，但是现在没有任何漂亮处可言。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mary made no response. She went down the path and through the second green door. There, she found more walls and winter vegetables and glass frames, but in the second wall there was another green door and it was not open. Perhaps it led into the garden which no one had seen for ten years. As she was not at all a timid child and always did what she wanted to do, Mary went to the green door and turned the handle. She hoped the door would not open because she wanted to be sure she had found the mysterious garden -- but it did open quite easily and she walked through it and found herself in an orchard. There were walls all round it also and trees trained against them, and there were bare fruit-trees growing in the winter-browned grass -- but there was no green door to be seen anywhere. Mary looked for it, and yet when she had entered the upper end of the garden she had noticed that the wall did not seem to end with the orchard but to extend beyond it as if it enclosed a place at the other side. She could see the tops of trees above the wall, and when she stood still she saw a bird with a bright red breast sitting on the topmost branch of one of them, and suddenly he burst into his winter song-almost as if he had caught sight of her and was calling to her.</div>

If she had been an affectionate child, who had been used to being loved, she would have broken her heart, but even though she was "Mistress Mary Quite Contrary'she was desolate, and the bright-breasted little bird brought a look into her sour little face which was almost a smile.

<div class="line_en">The robin hopped about busily pecking the soil and now and then stopped and looked at them a little. Mary though this black dewdrop eyes gazed at her with great curiosity.

<div class="line_en">This was plain speaking, and Mary Lennox had never heard the truth about herself in her life. Native servants always salaamed and submitted to you, whatever you did. She had never thought much about her looks, but she wondered if she was as unattractive as Ben Weatherstaff and she also wondered if she looked as sour as he had looked before the robin came. She actually began to wonder also if she was "nasty tempered." She felt uncomfortable.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是大实话，玛丽·伦诺克斯从来没有听到对她自己的真相。土著仆人总是最你额手行礼，顺从你，不管你做了什么。她以前从没怎么想过自己的样貌，但是她怀疑自己是不是和季元本一样不招人爱，她还怀疑自己的样子是不是和他在知更鸟来之前一样乖戾。她竟然开始怀疑自己确实“脾气凶恶”。她觉得不舒服。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Tha' an' me are a good bit alike," he said."We was wove out of th' same cloth. We're neither of us good lookin' an' we're both of us as sour as we look. We've got the same nasty tempers, both of us, I'll warrant."</div>

<div class="line_en">Suddenly a clear rippling little sound broke out near her and she turned round. She was standing a few feet from a young apple-tree and the robin had flown on to one of its branches and had burst out into a scrap of a song. Ben Weatherstaff laughed outright.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然一阵细小的声音波浪般在她附近响起，她转过身。她离一棵小苹果树有几尺远，知更鸟飞到一根枝条上，歌声突发。季元本放声大笑起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Would you make friends with me?" she said to the robin just as if she was speaking to a person.

<div class="line_cn" title="“你愿意和我交朋友吗？”她像对一个人一样对知更鸟说，“你愿意吗？”她说话的态度不是硬邦邦的小样儿，也不是专横跋扈的印度样儿，而是轻柔殷勤，季元本和她初听他吹哨时一般地惊讶。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Why," he cried out, "tha' said that as nice an' human as if tha' was a real child instead of a sharp old woman. Tha' said it almost like Dickon talks to his wild things on th'moor."</div>
