<div class="line_en">A fine layer of snow covered the yard, dusted the top of my truck, and whitened the road. But that wasn't the worst part. All the rain from yesterday had frozen solid -- coating the needles on the trees in fantastic, gorgeous patterns, and making the driveway a deadly ice slick. I had enough trouble not falling down when the ground was dry; it might be safer for me to go back to bed now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="院子里覆盖了一层薄雪，我的车顶披上了银装，道路铺上了白色的地毯。但这还不是最糟糕的。昨天下的雨全都冻成了冰——给树上的针叶穿上奇异瑰丽的衣衫，将我们家的私人车道变成了一块滑溜溜的冰面。地面干燥时，我都要克服许多困难才不至于摔跤；此刻也许回到床上去睡觉对我更安全。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I should be avoiding him entirely after my brainless and embarrassing babbling yesterday. And I was suspicious of him; why should he lie about his eyes? I was still frightened of the hostility I sometimes felt emanating from him, and I was still tongue-tied whenever I pictured his perfect face. I was well aware that my league and his league were spheres that did not touch. So I shouldn't be at all anxious to see him today.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在昨天那样不经大脑思考地，令人窘困地胡说一气之后，按说我本来应该躲着他才是。而且我对他一直心存疑虑；他为什么要在自己的眼睛这个问题上撒谎？我有时感到他身上散发着一种敌意，对这种敌意，我依然很害怕，而且每当我想象他那张完美无缺的脸时，我依然会张口结舌。我清楚地意识到，我们和他们是不同的群体，我们之间不会有交集，所以今天完全不应该急切地想见他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Driving to school, I distracted myself from my fear of falling and my unwanted speculations about Edward Cullen by thinking about Mike and Eric, and the obvious difference in how teenage boys responded to me here. I was sure I looked exactly the same as I had in Phoenix. Maybe it was just that the boys back home had watched me pass slowly through all the awkward phases of adolescence and still thought of me that way. Perhaps it was because I was a novelty here, where novelties were few and far between. Possibly my crippling clumsiness was seen as endearing rather than pathetic, casting me as a damsel in distress. Whatever the reason, Mike's puppy dog behavior and Eric's apparent rivalry with him were disconcerting. I wasn't sure if I didn't prefer being ignored.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="开车去学校的路上，我竭力去想迈克和埃里克，以及这里十几岁的男孩子对我的明显不同的反应，以此来分散注意力，使自己别老提心吊胆地怕摔倒和对爱德华·卡伦的那些没有用的胡乱推测。我非常清楚我的样子跟在凤凰城时完全一样。也许只是家那边的男孩子目睹了我度过自己那令人难堪的整个青春发育阶段的漫长过程，而且还在用老眼光看我罢了。也许是因为在这里我是初来乍到，大家觉得比较新奇，而这里这样的新奇并不多，而且十年八年都难得碰上一回。也说不定是大家觉得我笨手笨脚的，挺可爱而不是挺可怜，把我看成了一个需要保护的小姑娘。无论是出于什么原因，迈克小狗般的举止和埃里克明显地跟他较着劲儿弄得我很不安。我不知道自己是不是更喜欢被人忽略。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When I got out of my truck at school, I saw why I'd had so little trouble. Something silver caught my eye, and I walked to the back of the truck -- carefully holding the side for support -- to examine my tires. There were thin chains crisscrossed in diamond shapes around them. Charlie had gotten up who knows how early to put snow chains on my truck. My throat suddenly felt tight. I wasn't used to being taken care of, and Charlie's unspoken concern caught me by surprise.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到了学校从车上下来以后，我明白了自己几乎没有遇到任何麻烦的原因。一样银色的东西映入了我的眼帘，我走到后面——小心地抓着车身——去查看轮胎，只见上面十字交叉呈菱形地绑着细细的链条。不知道查理多早起床，给我的卡车上了防滑链。我的喉咙一下子发紧了。我不习惯有人照顾的滋味，查理默默的关心，着实让我受宠若惊了一把。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Just before I heard the shattering crunch of the van folding around the truck bed, something hit me, hard, but not from the direction I was expecting. My head cracked against the icy blacktop, and I felt something solid and cold pinning me to the ground. I was lying on the pavement behind the tan car I'd parked next to. But I didn't have a chance to notice anything else, because the van was still coming. It had curled gratingly around the end of the truck and, still spinning and sliding, was about to collide with me again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在我听到那辆客货两用车嘎吱一声撞上我卡车的底盘之前，什么东西撞击了我一下，很猛烈，但不是来自我以为的那个方向。我的头砰的一声磕在了冰冷的沥青路面上，感觉有某样硬而冷的东西把我压在了地上。我躺在一辆棕黄色的轿车后面的人行道上，我当时就把车停在这辆车的隔壁。但是没有机会去注意别的任何东西了，因为那辆客货两用车还在往前来。它绕过了卡车的车尾，发出了刺耳的磨擦声，还在旋转，还在滑动，眼看又要和我撞上了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Edward Cullen was standing four cars down from me, staring at me in horror. His face stood out from a sea of faces, all frozen in the same mask of shock. But of more immediate importance was the dark blue van that was skidding, tires locked and squealing against the brakes, spinning wildly across the ice of the parking lot. It was going to hit the back corner of my truck, and I was standing between them. I didn't even have time to close my eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱德华·卡伦站在距我四辆车的位置，一脸惊恐地盯着我。他的脸格外醒目，虽然有无数张脸，组成了一片脸的汪洋，而且也全都呆若木鸡，面无表情。但是更迫在眉睫的还是那辆滑行的深蓝色客货两用车，轮胎锁死了，刹车吱吱地尖叫，在停车场的冰面上打滑，旋转着向我撞来。眼看就要撞着我卡车的后角了，而我正好站在它们之间。我连闭眼都来不及了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A low oath made me aware that someone was with me, and the voice was impossible not to recognize. Two long, white hands shot out protectively in front of me, and the van shuddered to a stop a foot from my face, the large hands fitting providentially into a deep dent in the side of the van's body.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一句低声的咒骂，让我意识到有人跟我在一起，那声音听着很熟悉，不可能辨认不出来。两只长长的白手，箭一般地伸到了我前面来保护我，客货两用车在距我的脸一英尺远的地方颤抖着停住了，说来凑巧，那双大手与客货两用车侧面的一道凹痕正好吻合。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="死一般的寂静了一会儿之后，突然又响起了尖叫声。在这突如其来的喧闹声中，我听见不止一人在叫我的名字，但有一个声音比所有的尖叫声都要清晰，我听见爱德华·卡伦在耳边着急到几乎疯狂的哑着嗓子问道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then his hands moved so fast they blurred. One was suddenly gripping under the body of the van, and something was dragging me, swinging my legs around like a rag doll's, till they hit the tire of the tan car.

<div class="line_en">My mom was in hysterics, of course. I had to tell her I felt fine at least thirty times before she would calm down. She begged me to come home -- forgetting the fact that home was empty at the moment -- but her pleas were easier to resist than I would have thought. I was consumed by the mystery Edward presented. And more than a little obsessed by Edward himself. Stupid, stupid, stupid. I wasn't as eager to escape Forks as I should be, as any normal, sane person would be.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我妈自然是歇斯底里了。我起码得跟她说上三十遍我没事儿，她才会冷静下来。她恳求我回家去——忘掉家里暂时没人这件事——不过她的请求比我想象的要容易拒绝。我已经被爱德华带来的神秘弄得精疲力竭了，而且更有一点被他这个人给迷住了。愚蠢，愚蠢，愚蠢。我不渴望着逃离福克斯了，离开这个我本应该避而远之的地方，就像任何正常的神志清醒的人那样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I decided I might as well go to bed early that night. Charlie continued to watch me anxiously, and it was getting on my nerves. I stopped on my way to grab three Tylenol from the bathroom. They did help, and, as the pain eased, I drifted to sleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天晚上，我决定不妨早点儿上床睡觉。查理依旧不安地看着我，看得我都有些发毛了。我去卧室的中途停了下来，从卫生间抓了三颗泰诺。还确实管用，很快就止疼了，我不知不觉就睡着了。">查看中文翻译</div>
