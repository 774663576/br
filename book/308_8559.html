<div class="line_en">"What is it?" I asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“怎么了？”我问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It is that there are moments when a great longing for my friend Hastings comes over me. That is the friend of whom I spoke to you -- the one who resides now in the Argentine. Always, when I have had a big case, he has been by my side. And he has helped me -- yes, often he has helped me. For he had a knack, that one, of stumbling over the truth unawares -- without noticing it himself, bien entendu. At times, he has said something particularly foolish, and behold that foolish remark has revealed the truth to me! And then, too, it was his practice to keep a written record of the cases that proved interesting."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我常常思念我的朋友黑斯廷斯。他现在定居阿根廷了，我之前跟你提过。每次办大案子，身边总有他，而且他对我帮助很大——是的，帮助很大。因为他总能在不知不觉中发掘出真相——当然，当然，他自己常常留意不到。有时他会说些傻话，而正是这些傻话让我豁然开朗！还有，他喜欢将案情进展书写下来，这个习惯也非常有意思。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, as a matter of fact, I've read some of Captain Hastings's narratives, and I thought, why not try my hand at something of the same kind. Seemed a pity not to unique opportunity -- probably the only time I'll be mixed up with anything of this kind." I felt myself getting hotter and hotter, and more and more incoherent, as I floundered through the above speech.</div>

<div class="line_en">Still somewhat doubtful, I rummaged in the drawers of my desk and produced an untidy pile of manuscript which I handed over to him. With an eye on possible publication in the future, I had divided the work into chapters, and the night before I had brought it up to date with an account of Miss Russell's visit. Poirot had therefore twenty chapters.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我依然举棋不定，但还是从书桌抽屉里拿出一沓乱糟糟的手稿递给他。考虑到将来可能将这些文字付诸出版，我划分了若干章节，昨晚刚更新到拉塞尔小姐来访这部分。所以交给波洛的一共有二十章。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh! I comprehend perfectly; you have referred to me as comic -- as, perhaps, ridiculous now and then? It matters not at all. Hastings, he also was not always polite. Me, I have the mind above such trivialities."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦！这完全可以理解。你不止一次将我刻画得滑稽可笑，甚至荒诞不经，对吗？没关系，黑斯廷斯有时也不太拘礼。这种小问题我一向都不在乎。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“詹姆斯，”姐姐说，“你在手稿中没说我坏话吧？”我吓了一大跳，下巴差点掉下去了。这个问题我写稿时还真没留意。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I went into the workshop. Poirot was sitting by the window. The manuscript lay neatly piled on a chair beside him. He laid his hand on it and spoke.</div>

<div class="line_en">I left him with them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些手稿就留给波洛自己看了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I was obliged to go out to a case at some distance away and it was past eight o'clock when I got back, to be greeted with a plate of hot dinner on a tray, and the announcement that Poirot and my sister had supped together at half-past seven, and that the former had then gone to my workshop to finish his reading of the manuscript.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="今天出诊的目的地比较远，回家时已经过了晚上八点。迎接我的是热腾腾的晚餐。姐姐说七点半的时候波洛和她一起吃了饭，饭后波洛去了我的“工作室”，继续读那份手稿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Not so did Hastings write," continued my friend. "On every page, many, many times was the word "I." What he thought -- what he did. But you -- you have kept your personality in the background; only once or twice does it obtrude -- in scenes of home life, shall we say?" I blushed a little before the twinkle of his eye.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“黑斯廷斯的写法与你不同，”我的朋友继续说道，“每一页上都有很多个‘我’，他的想法和行动一目了然。而你则将自己放在幕后，只有寥寥几次出场——而且仅限于描述日常生活罢了。我说得对不对？”他目光炯炯地注视着我，让我有点脸红。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Not that it matters very much," said Caroline, reading my expression correctly. "M. Poirot will know what to think. He understands me much better than you do."</div>

<div class="line_en">Poirot ran to and fro rearranging things. Pulling out a chair here, altering the position of a lamp there, occasionally stooping to straighten one of the mats that covered the floor. He was specially fussing over the lighting. The lamps were arranged in. such a way as to throw a clear light on the side of the room where the chairs were grouped, at the same time leaving the other end of the room, where I presumed Poirot himself would sit, in a dim twilight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="波洛忙着调整屋内的摆设，到这边稍稍拖出一把椅子，到那边挪挪一盏台灯，偶尔还弯腰拉平地上的垫子。他格外关心照明问题，特意将灯光聚集到集中摆着椅子的房间一侧，另一侧的光线则十分暗淡——我猜他本人肯定要坐在这一边。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I will start at the beginning. When Miss Ackroyd asked me to investigate the case, I went up to Fernly Park with the good Doctor Sheppard. I walked with him along the terrace, where I was shown the footprints on the windowsill. From there Inspector Raglan took me along the path which leads to the drive. My eye was caught by a little |SS summer-house, and I searched it thoroughly. I found two things -- a scrap of starched cambric and an empty goose quill. The scrap of cambric immediately suggested to me a maid's apron. When Inspector Raglan showed me his list of the people in the house, I noticed at once that one of the maids -- Ursula Bourne, the parlourmaid -- had no real alibi."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我从头开始说起。接到艾克罗伊德小姐的委托后，我就和好心的谢泼德医生一起去了芬利庄园。我们来到露台，看了窗台上的鞋印。然后拉格伦警督又把我带到通往车道的那条小路上。一座小凉亭吸引了我的目光，经过仔细搜查，我找到了两件东西——一小片浆过的丝绢和一支空的鹅毛管。那片丝绢立刻令我联想到女仆的围裙。拉格伦警督给我看大宅中的仆役名单时，我一眼就注意到其中一名女仆——客厅女仆厄休拉·波恩——并没有真正的不在场证明。”">查看中文翻译</div>

</div>
</div>
<div class="line_en">"But I was held up by one point. The times did not fit. Ursula Bourne could certainly not have gone to the summer-house before nine-thirty, whereas the man must have got there by a few minutes past nine. I could, of course, assume that he waited there for half an hour. The only alternative supposition was that there had been two separate meetings in the summer-house that night. Eh bien, as soon as I went into that alternative I found several significant facts. I discovered that Miss Russell, the housekeeper, had visited Dr Sheppard that morning, and had displayed a good deal of interest in cures for victims of the drug habit. Taking that in conjunction with the goose quill, I assumed that the man in question came to Fernly to meet the housekeeper, and not Ursula Bourne. Who, then, did Ursula Bourne come to the rendezvous to meet? I was not long in doubt. First I found a ring -- a wedding ring -- with 'From R.' and a date inside it. Then I learnt that Ralph Paton had been seen coming up the path which led to the summer-house at twenty-five minutes past nine, and I also heard of a certain conversation which had taken place in the wood near the village that very afternoon -- a conversation between Ralph Paton and some unknown girl. So I had my facts succeeding each other in a neat and orderly manner. A secret marriage, an engagement announced on the day of the tragedy, the stormy interview in the wood, and the meeting arranged for the summer-house that night."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但我在其中一个环节上遇到了阻碍——时间衔接不上。九点半之前厄休拉·波恩不可能去过凉亭，而那个男人到达凉亭的时间则肯定是刚过九点。当然，我可以假设他在那里等了半个小时。除此之外就只有一种可能性了：那天晚上其实有两组不相干的人先后在凉亭里会面。从这条思路出发，我立刻发现了几个明显的事实。我得知女管家拉塞尔小姐那天早上找过谢泼德医生，对戒毒方法表现出极大兴趣。联系到鹅毛管，我便推断那男人去芬利庄园是要找拉塞尔小姐，而非厄休拉·波恩。那么，厄休拉·波恩到凉亭是和谁会面呢？这个谜很快揭开了。首先我发现一枚结婚戒指——内侧刻着‘R·赠’和日期；接着我得知，九点二十五分左右有人看见拉尔夫·佩顿出现在通往凉亭的小径上，我又听说同一天下午有人在村子附近的小树林里密谈——主角是拉尔夫·佩顿和某个姑娘。将这些事实环环相扣，顺序如下：一场秘密婚姻；谋杀当天曝光的订婚消息；树林里的激烈争吵；晚上在凉亭中的约会。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"According to her own story, she was in her bedroom from nine-thirty until ten. But supposing that instead she was in the summer-house? If so, she must have gone there to meet someone. Now we know from Dr Sheppard that someone from outside did come to the house that night -- the stranger whom he met just by the gate. At first glance it would seem that our problem was solved, and that the stranger went to the summer-house to meet Ursula Bourne. It was fairly certain that he did go to the summer-house because of the goose quill. That suggested at once to my mind a taker of drugs -- and one who had acquired the habit on the other side of the Atlantic where sniffing 'snow' is more common than in this country. The man whom Dr Sheppard met had an American accent, which fitted in with that supposition."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“根据她本人的说辞，九点半到十点之间她都待在卧室里。但假设她是在凉亭里呢？那她必定跑去和某人会面了。根据谢泼德医生的证词，我们知道当晚确实有个外人来过——就是他在庄园门口遇到的陌生人。乍看之下问题已经解决，那个陌生人是去凉亭见厄休拉·波恩。从那根鹅毛管推断，他也确实去过凉亭。我马上就想到此人是一名瘾君子——而且他是在大西洋彼岸染上毒瘾的，‘白粉’在那边可比我们这儿流行得多。谢泼德医生遇到的人带有美国口音，也符合我的假设。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Incidentally this proved to me one thing, that both Ralph Paton and Ursula Bourne (or Paton) had the strongest motives for wishing Mr Ackroyd out of the way.

<div class="line_en">"It explains, too," said Poirot, "why Major Blunt thought it was you who were in the study. Such scraps as came to him were fragments of dictation, and so his subconscious mind deduced that you were with him.
