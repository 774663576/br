<div class="line_en">Phileas Fogg was in prison. He had been shut up in the Custom House, and he was to be transferred to London the next day.</div>

<div class="line_en">Passepartout, when he saw his master arrested, would have fallen upon Fix had he not been held back by some policemen. Aouda was thunderstruck at the suddenness of an event which she could not understand. Passepartout explained to her how it was that the honest and courageous Fogg was arrested as a robber. The young woman's heart revolted against so heinous a charge, and when she saw that she could attempt to do nothing to save her protector, she wept bitterly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当福克先生被捕的时候，路路通要上去跟侦探拼命。但是来了几个警察把他拉开了。这件突如其来的暴行把艾娥达给吓怔了，她莫名其妙，一点也不明白是怎么回事。路路通把情况告诉了她。福克先生，这样一位正直、勇敢的绅士，她的救命恩人，居然被人当小偷抓起来了。年轻的夫人坚决地抗议这种污蔑。她非常气愤。当她觉得自己又无能为力的时候，她的眼泪不住地从脸上流了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The thought then struck Passepartout, that he was the cause of this new misfortune! Had he not concealed Fix's errand from his master? When Fix revealed his true character and purpose, why had he not told Mr. Fogg? If the latter had been warned, he would no doubt have given Fix proof of his innocence, and satisfied him of his mistake; at least, Fix would not have continued his journey at the expense and on the heels of his master, only to arrest him the moment he set foot on English soil. Passepartout wept till he was blind, and felt like blowing his brains out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时路路通忽然想起了一件事，这件事肯定是目前这一切不幸的根源！到底我为什么要一直对福克先生隐瞒住费克斯的身份呢？当费克斯对我说明了他是警察厅密探和他的任务的时候，为什么我一点也不告诉我主人呢？要是他事先知道了他一定会提出证据说明自己的身份，指出对方的误会；那样一来，福克先生决不会再为这个一心等待踏上英国领土，立即动手抓人的祸害精侦探出旅费了。而费克斯也就不会死跟在他后边了。可怜的小伙子一想到自己的这些错误和疏忽，就后悔得要死。他哭了。他痛苦万分，他恨不得一头撞死！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">If anyone, at this moment, had entered the Custom House, he would have found Mr. Fogg seated, motionless, calm, and without apparent anger, upon a wooden bench. He was not, it is true, resigned; but this last blow failed to force him into an outward betrayal of any emotion. Was he being devoured by one of those secret rages, all the more terrible because contained, and which only burst forth, with an irresistible force, at the last moment? No one could tell. There he sat, calmly waiting -- for what? Did he still cherish hope? Did he still believe, now that the door of this prison was closed upon him, that he would succeed?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时谁要走进海关办事处的这间房子里，就会看见福克先生一动不动地坐在一张长凳上，安安静静地一点也不着急。虽然不能说他是“听天由命”，但是，至少在外表上，这个意外的打击确实没有使他惊慌失措。难道他现在还有必然胜利的把握吗？这一点谁也不知道。但福克确实是很安详地在那儿等待着……他在等什么呢？他还没死心吗？在他进了这间拘留室，就被锁在里面的时候，难道他还认为自己的旅行计划能胜利完成吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Aouda and he had remained, despite the cold, under the portico of the Custom House. Neither wished to leave the place; both were anxious to see Mr. Fogg again.</div>

<div class="line_en">That gentleman was really ruined, and that at the moment when he was about to attain his end. This arrest was fatal. Having arrived at Liverpool at twenty minutes before twelve on the 21st of December, he had till a quarter before nine that evening to reach the Reform Club, that is, nine hours and a quarter; the journey from Liverpool to London was six hours.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="至于这位绅上，他毫无疑问是完全垮了。他是在马上就要成功的时候垮了。这次可真把他弄得一败涂地，无法挽回了。12月21号十一点四十分到达了利物浦，离开八点四十五分他预定要回到改良俱乐部的时候还足有九个小时零四十五分，而坐火车到伦敦只需要六个小时。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">However that may have been, Mr. Fogg carefully put his watch upon the table, and observed its advancing hands. Not a word escaped his lips, but his look was singularly set and stern. The situation, in any event, was a terrible one, and might be thus stated: if Phileas Fogg was honest he was ruined; if he was a knave, he was caught.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不管怎样，福克先生依然是把他的表规规矩矩地放到一张桌子上，看着表针在走动。他半句话也不说，他的目光非常集中，一动也不动。总之，当前的情况是很可怕的。如果看不出福克内心深处的打算，这种情况就会使你得出这样的结论：福克先生如果真是个正人君子，那他现在算是给毁了。如果他真是小偷，那他现在已经是被逮住了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Custom House clock struck one. Mr. Fogg observed that his watch was two hours too fast.</div>

<div class="line_en">Did escape occur to him? Did he examine to see if there were any practicable outlet from his prison? Did he think of escaping from it? Possibly; for once he walked slowly around the room. But the door was locked, and the window heavily barred with iron rods. He sat down again, and drew his journal from his pocket. On the line where these words were written, "21st December, Saturday, Liverpool," he added, "80th day, 11.40 a. m.," and waited.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他是不是打算逃跑？他是不是想在这屋里找条可逃的路？他想逃吗？人们也许可以这样怀疑他，因为他曾在屋子里兜了一个时候。但是门锁得很紧，窗子上都装着铁栏杆。结果他又坐下来了。他从皮夹里取出了他的旅行计划表，上面最后一行写着：“12月21日，星期六到达利物浦。”他在“星期六”底下又接着写了下面几个字：“上午十一点四十分，第八十天。”">查看中文翻译</div>
