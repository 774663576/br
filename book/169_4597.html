<div class="line_en">It was not all his fear of drowning, though that was surely some of it. It was the motion of the ship as well, the way the decks rolled beneath his feet. "I have a queasy belly," he confessed to Dareon the day they sailed from Eastwatch-by-the-Sea. The singer slapped him on the back and said, "With a belly big as yours, Slayer, that is a lot of quease."</div>

<div class="line_en">Sam tried to keep a brave face on him, for Gilly's sake if little else. She had never seen the sea before. When they were struggling through the snows after fleeing Craster's Keep, they had come on several lakes, and even those had been a wonder to her. As Blackbird slipped away from shore the girl began to tremble, and big salt tears rolled down her cheeks. "Gods be good," Sam heard her whisper. Eastwatch vanished first, and the Wall grew smaller and smaller in the distance, until it finally disappeared. The wind was coming up by then. The sails were the faded grey of a black cloak that had been washed too often, and Gilly's face was white with fear. "This is a good ship," Sam tried to tell her. "You don't have to be afraid." But she only looked at him, held her baby tighter, and fled below.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“在找美人鱼吗，杀手？”戴利恩看到山姆注视着海湾，于是说道，这位从东海望加入的歌手年轻英俊，长着一头金发和浅褐色眼睛，看上去更像个神秘的王子而不是黑衣弟兄。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sam soon found himself clutching tightly to the gunwale and watching the sweep of the oars. The way they all moved together was somehow beautiful to behold, and better than looking at the water. Looking at the water only made him think of drowning. When he was small his lord father had tried to teach him how to swim by throwing him into the pond beneath Horn Hill. The water had gotten in his nose and in his mouth and in his lungs, and he coughed and wheezed for hours after Ser Hyle pulled him out. After that he never dared go in any deeper than his waist.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆也不由自主地抓紧船舷，眼睛死盯着船桨划动——至少它们整齐划一的动作有一种美，好歹比看着水面强。看着水面只能让他想到被淹死。小时候，父亲大人为教他游泳，便把他扔进角陵城边的水池。水从鼻子和嘴巴灌进来，流到肺部，虽然最后海尔爵士将他拉了上来，但他咳嗽喘息了好几个小时，并且从此以后再也不敢踏入深过腰间的水里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Bay of Seals was a lot deeper than his waist, and not so friendly as that little fishpond below his father's castle. Its waters were grey and green and choppy, and the wooded shore they followed was a snarl of rocks and whirlpools. Even if he could kick and crawl that far somehow, the waves were like to smash him up against some stone and break his head to pieces.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="海豹湾比他的腰深好多啊，也不若父亲城堡底下的小鱼塘来得友善。灰绿色的海水跌宕起伏，覆盖着树林的海岸边布满凌乱的巨石与旋涡。即使他能连踢带爬地游泳，也有可能被海浪冲到石头上，撞碎脑袋。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Going to the Citadel to forge a chain and be a maester, to be of better service to the Watch, he told himself, but the thought just made him weary. He did not want to be a maester, with a heavy chain wrapped around his neck, cold against his skin. He did not want to leave his brothers, the only friends he'd ever had. And he certainly did not want to face the father who had sent him to the Wall to die.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was different for the others. For them, the voyage would have a happy ending. Gilly would be safe at Horn Hill, with all the width of West-eros between her and the horrors she had known in the haunted forest. As a serving maid in his father's castle, she would be warm and well fed, a small part of a great world she could never have dreamed of as Craster's wife. She would watch her son grow up big and strong, and become a huntsman or a stablehand or a smith. If the boy showed any aptitude for arms, some knight might even take him as a squire.</div>

<div class="line_en">Even Dareon would be happier. He had always claimed to be innocent of the rape that sent him to the Wall, insisting that he belonged at some lord's court, singing for his supper. Now he would have that chance. Jon had named him a recruiter, to take the place of a man named Yoren, who had vanished and was presumed dead. His task would be to travel the Seven Kingdoms, singing of the valor of the Night's Watch, and from time to time returning to the Wall with new recruits.</div>

<div class="line_en">Maester Aemon was going to a better place as well. It was pleasant to think of him spending whatever time remained him bathed by the warm breezes of Oldtown, conversing with his fellow maesters and sharing his wisdom with acolytes and novices. He had earned his rest, a hundred times over.</div>

<div class="line_en">He thought that would excite her. He could not have been more wrong. Gilly peered at him with flat, dull eyes, looking through some strands of unwashed hair. "If you want, m'lord."</div>

<div class="line_en">But not looking at the water was even worse, Sam realized in the cramped cabin beneath the sterncastle that the passengers were sharing. He tried to take his mind off the roiling in his stomach by talking with Gilly as she nursed her son. "This ship will take us as far as Braavos," he said. "We'll find another ship to carry us to Oldtown. I read a book about Braavos when I was small. The whole city is built in a lagoon on a hundred little islands, and they have a titan there, a stone man hundreds of feet high. They have boats instead of horses, and their mummers play out written stories instead of just making up the usual stupid farces. The food is very good too, especially the fish. They have all kinds of clams and eels and oysters, fresh from their lagoon. We ought to have a few days between ships. If we do, we can go and see a mummer show, and have some oysters."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不在外头看水面更糟，挤在尾楼底下大家共享的狭促船舱里，山姆的肚子就受不了。他曾试图为正给儿子喂奶的吉莉打气。“这艘船将把我们带到布拉佛斯，”他说，“我们再在那儿找船去旧镇。我小时候看过一本关于布拉佛斯的书，据说该城建于一个潟湖周围，由上百岛屿组成，湖口还有泰坦巨人呢，那是一个数百尺高的石头人哟。他们用船只代替马匹，他们的戏子表演的是精巧的剧本，而非随处可见的愚蠢的即兴闹剧。那里的东西也很好吃，特别是鱼，还有各种各样的蛤、鳗鱼和牡蛎，都是从潟湖中捕上来的新鲜货。转船期间，我们应该有几天空隙，我带你去看戏吃牡蛎吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The motion of the boat was stirring up the eggs and bacon and fried bread that Sam had eaten before the ship set out. All at once he could not stand the cabin one more instant. He pushed himself back to his feet and clambered up the ladder to give his breakfast to the sea. The sickness came on Sam so strongly that he did not stop to gauge which way the wind was blowing, so he retched from the wrong rail and ended up spattering himself. Even so, he felt much better afterward… though not for long.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="船只摇晃，搅起肚内的食物，起程前，他刚吃过鸡蛋、培根和炸面包。忽然间，山姆再也无法忍受在船舱里多待一刻。于是他站起身，爬上梯子，去把早饭交给大海。山姆晕船晕得如此厉害，他甚至无暇关心风向，结果呕吐时没选对船舷，污物全溅到了自己身上。虽然如此，他仍然感觉好多了…尽管为时不长。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The ship was Blackbird, the largest of the Watch's galleys. Storm Crow and Talon were faster, Cotter Pyke told Maester Aemon back at Eastwatch-by-the-Sea, but they were fighting ships, lean, swift birds of prey where the rowers sat on open decks. Blackbird was a better choice for the rough waters of the narrow sea beyond Skagos. "There have been storms," Pyke warned them. "Winter storms are worse, but autumn's are more frequent."</div>

<div class="line_en">The first ten days were calm enough, as Blackbird crept across the Bay of Seals, never out of sight of land. It was cold when the wind was blowing, but there was something bracing about the salt smell in the air. Sam could hardly eat, and when he did force something down it did not stay down for long, but aside from that he did not do too badly. He tried to bolster Gilly's courage and give her what cheer he could, but that proved hard. She would not come up on deck, no matter what he said, and seemed to prefer to huddle in the dark with her son. The babe liked the ship no more than his mother did, it seemed. When he was not squalling, he was retching up his mother's milk. His bowels were loose and always moving, staining the furs that Gilly wrapped him in to keep him warm and filling the air with a brown stench. No matter how many tallow candles Sam lit, the smell of shit persisted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最初十天相当平静，黑鸟号在海豹湾中行驶，从没让陆地离开视野。起风时很冷，但空气中有股清新的咸味。山姆几乎吃不下东西，即使强迫自己吞咽下去，食物在肚子里也留不长，但除此之外，他感觉还不算太糟。他多次鼓励吉莉，尽量让她高兴，事实证明这并不容易。无论他怎么说，她都不肯上甲板去，宁愿留在黑暗中抱着儿子，而婴儿也似乎跟母亲一样不喜欢船。行船期间，他不是哇哇哭闹，就是呕吐母亲的乳汁，还老拉肚子，弄脏了吉莉裹着他为他保暖的毛皮，弄得舱内阵阵恶臭。不管山姆点上多少根牛油蜡烛，粪便的味道始终存在。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was more pleasant out in the open air, especially when Dareon was singing. The singer was known to Blackbird's oarsmen, and would play for them as they rowed. He knew all their favorite songs: sad ones like "The Day They Hanged Black Robin," "The Mermaid's Lament," and "Autumn of My Day," rousing ones like "Iron Lances" and "Seven Swords for Seven Sons," bawdy ones like "Milady's Supper," "Her Little Flower," and "Meggett Was a Merry Maid, a Merry Maid Was She." When he sang "The Bear and the Maiden Fair," all the oarsmen joined in, and Blackbird seemed to fly across the water. Dareon had not been much of a swordsman, Sam knew from their days training under Alliser Thorne, but he had a beautiful voice. "Honey poured over thunder," Maester Aemon had once called it. He played woodharp and fiddle too, and even wrote his own songs… though Sam did not think them very good. Still, it was good to sit and listen, though the chest was so hard and splintery that Sam was almost grateful for his fleshy buttocks. Fat men take a cushion with them wherever they go, he thought.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="室外要舒服多了，尤其是戴利恩唱歌的时候。歌手很受黑鸟号的船员们欢迎，因为他会在他们划桨时表演。他会唱所有他们喜欢的歌：有悲伤的歌，比如《吊死黑罗宾的日子》、《人鱼挽歌》和《我的秋天》；也有雄壮的歌，比如《铁枪》和《七子七剑》；还有《贵妇的晚餐》、《她的小花儿》和《快乐处女麦吉特》这样的靡靡之音。每当他唱到《狗熊与美处女》时，所有桨手都会跟着唱，而黑鸟号仿佛在水面上飞翔。早在艾里莎·索恩手下受训时，山姆就知道戴利恩的武艺不精，但他有副好嗓门，伊蒙学士形容说那像加了蜜的雷。他也会弹木竖琴，会拉小提琴，甚至会自己写歌…尽管山姆对他的歌不太感冒，无论如何，坐着听歌算是船上最好的消遣，就是箱子太硬，太多木刺，让山姆不由得感谢自己生了个肥屁股。胖子的优势就是走到哪儿都自带坐垫，他心想。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Maester Aemon preferred to spend his days on deck as well, huddled beneath a pile of furs and gazing out across the water. "What is he looking at?" Dareon wondered one day. "For him it's as dark up here as it is down in the cabin."</div>

"When last I passed this way, I saw every rock and tree and whitecap, and watched the grey gulls flying in our wake. I was five-and-thirty and had been a maester of the chain for sixteen years. Egg wanted me to help him rule, but I knew my place was here. He sent me north aboard the Golden Dragon, and insisted that his friend Ser Duncan see me safe to Eastwatch. No recruit had arrived at the Wall with so much pomp since Nymeria sent the Watch six kings in golden fetters. Egg emptied out the dungeons too, so I would not need to say my vows alone. My honor guard, he called them. One was no less a man than Brynden Rivers. Later he was chosen lord commander."</div>

<div class="line_en">Even so, it was a better voyage than the last one Sam had taken. He had been no more than ten when he set sail on Lord Redwyne's galleas, the Arbor Queen. Five times as large as Blackbird and magnificent to behold, she had three great burgundy sails and banks of oars that flashed gold and white in the sunlight. The way they rose and fell as the ship departed Oldtown had made Sam hold his breath… but that was the last good memory he had of the Redwyne Straits. Then as now the sea had made him sick, to his lord father's disgust.</div>

<div class="line_en">Beneath grey skies they sailed, east and south and east again, as the Bay of Seals widened about them. The captain, a grizzled brother with a belly like a keg of ale, wore blacks so stained and faded that the crew called him Old Tattersalt. He seldom said a word. His mate made up for him, blistering the salt air with curses whenever the wind died or the oarsmen seemed to flag. They ate oaten porridge in the mornings, pease porridge in the afternoons, and salt beef, salt cod, and salt mutton at night, and washed it down with ale. Dareon sang, Sam retched, Gilly cried and nursed her babe, Maester Aemon slept and shivered, and the winds grew colder and more blustery with every passing day.</div>

Thereafter, Lord Randyll forbade Sam to eat apples so long as they remained beneath Paxter Redwyne's roof. He had been seasick on their voyage home as well, but so relieved to be going that he almost welcomed the taste of vomit at the back of his throat. It was not until they were back at Horn Hill that his mother told Sam that his father had never meant for him to return. "Horas was to come with us in your place, whilst you remained on the Arbor as Lord Paxter's page and cupbearer. If you had pleased him, you would have been betrothed to his daughter." Sam could still recall the soft touch of his mother's hand as she washed the tears off his face with a bit of lace, dampened with her spit. "My poor Sam," she murmured. "My poor poor Sam."</div>

<div class="line_en">The island sat at the mouth of the Bay of Seals, massive and mountainous, a stark and forbidding land peopled by savages. They lived in caves and grim mountain fastnesses, Sam had read, and rode great shaggy unicorns to war. Skagos meant "stone" in the Old Tongue. The Skagosi named themselves the stoneborn, but their fellow northmen called them Skaggs and liked them little. Only a hundred years ago Skagos had risen in rebellion. Their revolt had taken years to quell and claimed the life of the Lord of Winterfell and hundreds of his sworn swords. Some songs said the Skaggs were cannibals; supposedly their warriors ate the hearts and livers of the men they slew. In ancient days, the Skagosi had sailed to the nearby isle of Skane, seized its women, slaughtered its men, and ate them on a pebbled beach in a feast that lasted for a fortnight. Skane remained unpeopled to this day.</div>

Dareon screamed at him once, when all of them were huddled in the cabin. It doesn't, Sam wanted to tell him, but so long as I'm thinking about that I'm not thinking about drowning or being sick or Maester Aemon's shivering. "It doesn't," he managed to squeak, but the thunder drowned out all the rest of it, and the deck lurched and knocked him sideways. Gilly was sobbing. The babe was shrieking.

As Blackbird rounded the south coast of Skagos, they spotted the wreckage of a galley on the rocks. Some of her crew had washed up on the shore, and the rooks and crabs had gathered to pay them homage. "Too bloody close," grumbled Old Tattersalt when he saw. "One good blow, and we'll be breaking up aside them." Exhausted as they were, his rowers bent to their oars again, and the ship clawed south toward the narrow sea, till Skagos dwindled to no more than a few dark shapes in the sky that might have been thunderheads, or the tops of tall black mountains, or both.

Gilly did not leave the child willingly, I am certain. What threats the Lord Commander made, what promises, I can only guess… but threats and promises there surely were."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“她为两个孩子哺乳，两个孩子都爱，”伊蒙说，“但爱的程度并不相同，没有一个母亲会给所有孩子同样的爱，甚至连天上的圣母也不例外。我敢肯定，吉莉并非自愿丢下儿子的，总司令大人如何威胁，如何承诺，我猜不到…但一定有过…”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">No happy choice. Sam thought of all the trials that he and Gilly suffered, Craster's Keep and the death of the Old Bear, snow and ice and freezing winds, days and days and days of walking, the wights at Whitetree, Coldhands and the tree of ravens, the Wall, the Wall, the Wall, the Black Gate beneath the earth. What had it all been for? No happy choices and no happy endings.</div>

<div class="line_en">He wanted to scream. He wanted to howl and sob and shake and curl up in a little ball and whimper. He switched the babes, he told himself. He switched the babes to protect the little prince, to keep him away from Lady Melisandre's fires, away from her red god. If she burns Gilly's boy, who will care? No one but Gilly. He was only Craster's whelp, an abomination born of incest, not the son of the King-beyond-the-Wall. He's no good for a hostage, no good for a sacrifice, no good for anything, he doesn't even have a name.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他想要尖声嘶喊，他想要号叫哭泣，他想要颤抖着呜咽着蜷成一个球。琼恩调换了婴儿，他告诉自己，琼恩调换了婴儿，以保护小王子，好让他远离梅莉珊卓的火焰，远离她的红神。假如她烧死的是吉莉的儿子，又有谁会在乎呢？除了吉莉之外没有人。他不过是卡斯特的小崽子，出自乱伦的怪物，远远比不上塞外之王的儿子重要。他既不能做人质，也不能做祭品，一点用也没有，他甚至没有名字。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Wordless, Sam staggered up onto the deck to retch, but there was nothing in his belly to bring up. Night had come upon them, a strange still night such as they had not seen for many days. The sea was black as glass. At the oars, the rowers rested. One or two were sleeping where they sat. The wind was in the sails, and to the north Sam could even see a scattering of stars, and the red wanderer the free folk called the Thief. That ought to be my star, Sam thought miserably. I helped to make Jon Lord Commander, and I brought him Gilly and the babe. There are no happy endings.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆默默无语地蹒跚上甲板去呕吐，但肚子里没东西可以倒出来。黑夜已经降临，这个夜晚平静得出奇，好多天都没有这样的平静。黑沉沉的海洋仿佛玻璃一般，桨手们坐在桨位上休息，其中一两个睡着了。风动船帆，山姆看到北方的点点繁星，还有被自由民称做“盗贼星”的红色流浪星。那颗星星代表我，山姆悲哀地想，我助琼恩当上总司令，我把吉莉和婴儿带给他。没有幸福的结局。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No." Sam wiped his nose, and pointed south with a fat finger, toward the gathering darkness. "There," he said. No sooner had he spoken than lightning flashed, sudden and silent and blinding bright. The distant clouds glowed for half a heartbeat, mountains heaped on mountains, purple and red and yellow, taller than the world. "The worst isn't done. The worst is just beginning, and there are no happy endings."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不。”山姆擦了擦鼻子，用胖胖的手指指向乌云密布的南方，指向那片聚集的黑暗。“看那儿。”他说。话刚出口，突然远方来了一道沉默的闪电，光亮炫目，云层闪烁了片刻，仿佛层层叠叠的山峦，呈现紫色、红色，还有黄色，高高矗立在世界尽头。“最糟糕的还没有到来。最糟糕的才刚刚开始。永远也没有幸福的结局。”">查看中文翻译</div>
