<div class="line_en">Many years passed and the young man was very successful in business. He had a beautiful home and a wonderful family, but realizing his father was very old, he thought perhaps he should go to see him. He had not seen him since that graduation day. Before he could make the arrangements, he received a telegram telling him his father had passed away, and willed all of his possessions to his son. He needed to come home immediately and take care of things.</div>

<div class="line_en">A young man was getting ready to graduate from college. For many months he had admired a beautiful sports car in a dealer's showroom, and knowing his father could well afford it, he told him that was all he wanted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个年轻人即将大学毕业。数月来，他爱上了某经销商的展室中那一辆漂亮的跑车，他知道自己的父亲有能力负担得起，就告诉父亲，这是他最想要的礼物。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As Graduation Day approached, the young man awaited signs that his father had purchased the car. Finally, on the morning of his graduation, his father called him into his private study. His father told him how proud he was to have such a fine son, and told him how much he loved him. He handed his son a beautiful wrapped gift box. Curious, but somewhat disappointed, the young man opened the box and found a lovely, leather-bound Bible, with the young man's name embossed in gold.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在毕业典礼即将来临的日子里，年轻人等待着他的父亲把这辆车送给他，而种种迹象表明，他的父亲会把这礼物送给他。最后，在毕业典礼的那天上午，父亲把他叫到自己的书房。他父亲告诉他，他是多么自豪能有这样一个好儿子，并告诉他，他是多么爱他。他递给儿子一个包装精美的礼品盒。出于好奇，这位年轻人打开了盒子，但令他失望的是，里面装的是一个可爱的皮革装订的圣经，上面还用金印烫着年轻人的名字。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Angrily, he raised his voice to his father and said, "With all your money you give me a Bible?" He then stormed out of the house, leaving the Bible.</div>

<div class="line_en">When he arrived at his father's house, sudden sadness and regret filled his heart. He began to search through his father's important papers and saw the still new Bible, just as he had left it years ago.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他来到了父亲的家，突然感到心里一阵悲伤与懊悔。他仔细清理父亲的重要文件，还看到了当年那本圣经，崭新就如他几年前离开时那样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">With tears, he opened the Bible and began to turn the pages. As he was reading, a car key dropped from the back of the Bible. It had a tag with the dealer's name, the same dealer who had the sports car he had desired. On the tag was the date of his graduation, and the words…"Paid in full."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他噙着泪水打开圣经，当他翻到某一页时，一把钥匙从书的背面掉出来了。钥匙上面打着一个经销商的名字，是那辆跑车经销商的名字。这是他曾渴望的标记。而标签上还有他毕业的日期，还有充满爱的语言“款已付清…”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">How many times do we miss blessings because they are not packaged as we expected? I trust you enjoyed this. Do not spoil what you have by desiring what you have not; but remember that what you now have was once among the things you only hoped for. Sometimes we don't realize the good fortune we have or we could have because we expect "the packaging" to be different. What may appear as bad fortune may in fact be the door that is just waiting to be opened.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们多少次与祝福擦肩而过，仅仅是因为它没有按照我们想象中的样子包装好？我相信你理解（明白）这一点。不要用你渴望得到而没得到的，去破坏你所拥有的一切，但你要记住这一点：你现在所拥有的，恰恰也是你曾经一心期待得到的。有时，我们并没有意识到自己有多么幸运，或者只是因为幸运与我们想象的有所不同。那些表面上看起来像是坏的运气，实际上可能正是需要开启才知道的幸运。">查看中文翻译</div>
