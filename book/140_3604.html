<div class="line_en">This event -- which I should be sorry to discuss in a tone of unsuitable levity -- occurred in the summer of 18—. Mr. Barnabas Shuttleworthy, one of the wealthiest and most respectable citizens of the borough, had been missing for several days under circumstances which gave rise to suspicion of foul play. Mr. Shuttleworthy had set out from Rattleborough very early one Saturday morning, on horseback, with the avowed intention of proceeding to the city of P, about fifteen miles distant, and of returning the night of the same day. Two hours after his departure, however, his horse returned without him, and without the saddle-bags which had been strapped on his back at starting. The animal was wounded, too, and covered with mud. These circumstances naturally gave rise to much alarm among the friends of the missing man, and when it was found, on Sunday morning, that he had not yet made his appearance, the whole borough arose en masse to go and look for his body.</div>

<div class="line_en">The foremost and most energetic in instituting this search was the bosom friend of Mr. Shuttleworthy -- a Mr. Charles Goodfellow, or, as he was universally called, "Charley Goodfellow," or "Old Charley Goodfellow." Now, whether it is a marvellous coincidence, or whether it is that the name itself has an imperceptible effect upon the character, I have never yet been able to ascertain; but the fact is unquestionable, that there never yet was any person named Charles who was not an open, manly, honest, good-natured and frank-hearted fellow, with a rich, clear voice, that did you good to hear it, and an eye that looked you always straight in the face, as much as to say "I have a clear conscience myself; am afraid of no man, and am altogether above doing a mean action." And thus all the hearty, careless, "walking gentlemen" of the stage are very certain to be called Charles.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="查特尔沃西先生的挚友查尔斯·古德费罗先生，或者大家都叫他“查理·古德费罗先生”或者“老查理·古德费罗先生”，是进行这项研究的最重要和最有活力的人。现在，不管这是多么奇妙的巧合或者是这个名字本身对这个角色有着潜移默化的影响，我还无法确定；但事实是毋庸置疑的，从来没有一个叫查尔斯的人，不是一个开朗，有男子气概，诚实，善良，坦率的人，有一个丰富，清晰的声音，你听到它很高兴，一只眼睛总是直视着你的脸，甚至说“我自己问心无愧，不怕任何人，完全不做卑鄙的事。”因此，舞台上所有心地善良、漫不经心的“散步的绅士”都一定叫查尔斯。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now "Old Charley Goodfellow," although he had been in Rattleborough not longer than six months or thereabouts, and although nobody knew any thing about him before he came to settle in the neighbourhood, had experienced no difficulty in the world in making the acquaintance of all the respectable people in the borough. Not a man of them but would have taken his bare word for a thousand at any moment; and as for the women, there is no saying what they would not have done to oblige him. And all this came of his having been christened Charles, and of his possessing, in consequence, that ingenuous face which is proverbially the very "best letter of recommendation."</div>

<div class="line_en">I have already said that Mr. Shuttleworthy was one of the most respectable, and, undoubtedly, he was the most wealthy man in Rattleborough, while "Old Charley Goodfellow" was upon as intimate terms with him as if he had been his own brother. The two old gentlemen were next-door neighbours, and although Mr. Shuttleworthy seldom, if ever, visited "Old Charley," and never was known to take a meal in his house, still this did not prevent the two friends from being exceedingly intimate, as I have just observed; for "Old Charley" never let a day pass without stepping in three or four times to see how his neighbour came on, and very often he would stay to breakfast or tea, and almost always to dinner; and then the amount of wine that was made way with by the two cronies at a sitting, it would really be a difficult thing to ascertain. Old Charley's favourite beverage was Château Margaux, and it appeared to do Mr. Shuttleworthy's heart good to see the old fellow swallow it, as he did, quart after quart; so that, one day, when the wine was in and the wit, as a natural consequence, somewhat out, he said to his crony, as he slapped him upon the back -- "I tell you what it is, Old Charley, you are, by all odds, the heartiest old fellow I ever came across in all my born days; and, since you love to guzzle the wine at that fashion, I'll be darned if I don't have to make thee a present of a big box of the Château Margaux. Od rot me," — (Mr. Shuttleworthy had a sad habit of swearing, although he seldom went beyond "Od rot me," or "By gosh," or "By the jolly golly,") — "Od rot me," says he, "if I don't send an order to town this very afternoon for a double box of the best that can be got, and I'll make ye a present of it, I will -- ye needn't say a word, now -- I will, I tell ye, and there's an end of it; so look out for it -- it will come to hand some of these fine days, precisely when ye are looking for it the least." I mention this little bit of liberality on the part of Mr. Shuttleworthy, just by way of showing you how very intimate an understanding existed between the two friends.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我已经说过，沙特尔沃西先生是最受人尊敬的人之一，毫无疑问，他是拉特伯勒最富有的人，而“老查理·古德费罗”和他关系非常亲密，就好像他是自己的兄弟一样。这两位老先生是隔壁的邻居，虽然沙特尔沃西先生很少去拜访“老查理”，也从来没有人知道他会在家里吃饭，但正如我刚才所说，这并没有妨碍这两位朋友之间的亲密关系；因为“老查理”从来不会让一天不走三、四次就去看看邻居的近况，他经常留下来吃早饭或喝茶，几乎总是去吃晚饭；然后两个亲信坐在一起酿了多少酒，真的很难确定。老查理最喜欢的饮料是玛歌酒庄，沙特尔沃西先生看到老家伙一夸脱接一夸脱地把它吞下去，心里似乎很高兴；因此，有一天，当酒开了，机智自然有些出格时，他对他的亲信说，他拍了拍他的背：“我告诉你，老查理，你很可能是我这辈子遇到的最热心的老家伙了；而且，既然你喜欢这样大口地喝葡萄酒，如果我不给你做一大盒玛歌酒庄的礼物，那我就倒霉了。他说：“如果我今天下午不下命令进城买一盒最好的，我就给你们做个礼物，我会把它送给你们的。”我会的，你们不必说一句话，现在，我会的，我告诉你们，这一切都结束了，所以要当心，这美好的日子总会到来，正是你们最不想看到的时候。”我提到了沙特尔沃西先生的这一点宽宏大量，只是向你们展示两位朋友之间有多么亲密的理解。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At first, he was too much overpowered with grief to be able to do any thing at all, or to concert upon any plan of action; so that for a long time he endeavoured to dissuade Mr. Shuttleworthy's other friends from making a stir about the matter, thinking it best to wait awhile -- say for a week or two, or a month or two, to see if something wouldn't turn up, or if Mr. Shuttleworthy wouldn't come in the natural way, and explain his reasons for sending his horse on before. I dare say you have often observed this disposition to temporize or to procrastinate in people who are labouring under any very poignant sorrow. Their powers of mind seem to be rendered torpid, so that they have a horror of any thing like action, and like nothing in the world so well as to lie quietly in bed and "nurse their grief," as the old ladies express it -- that is to say, ruminate over their trouble.</div>

<div class="line_en">Well, on the Sunday morning in question, when it came to be fairly understood that Mr. Shuttleworthy had met with foul play, I never saw any one so profoundly affected as "Old Charley Goodfellow." When he first heard that the horse had come home without his master, and without his master's saddle-bags, and all bloody from a pistol shot that had gone clean through and through the poor animal's chest without quite killing him; when he heard all this, he turned as pale as if the missing man had been his own dear brother or father, and shivered and shook all over as if he had had a fit of the ague.</div>

<div class="line_en">The people of Rattleborough had, indeed, so high an opinion of the wisdom and discretion of "Old Charley," that the greater part of them felt disposed to agree with him, and not make a stir in the business "until something should turn up," as the honest old gentleman worded it; and I believe that, after all, this would have been the general determination but for the very suspicious interference of Mr. Shuttleworthy's nephew, a young man of very dissipated habits, and otherwise of rather bad character. This nephew, whose name was Pennifeather, would listen to nothing like reason in the matter of "lying quiet," but insisted upon making immediate search for the "corpse of the murdered man." This was the expression he employed; and Mr. Goodfellow acutely remarked at the time, that it was "a singular expression, to say no more." This remark of Old Charley's, too, had great effect upon the crowd; and one of the party was heard to ask, very impressively, "how it happened that young Mr. Pennifeather was so intimately cognizant of all the circumstances connected with his wealthy uncle's disappearance, as to feel authorized to assert, distinctly and unequivocally, that his uncle was 'a murdered man.'" Hereupon some little squibbing and bickering occurred among various members of the crowd, and especially between "Old Charley" and Mr. Pennifeather -- although this latter occurrence was, indeed, by no means a novelty, for no good will had subsisted between the parties for the last three or four months; and matters had even gone so far that Mr. Pennifeather had actually knocked down his uncle's friend for some alleged excess of liberty that the latter had taken in the uncle's house, of which the nephew was an inmate. Upon this occasion, "Old Charley" is said to have behaved with exemplary moderation and Christian charity. He arose from the blow, adjusted his clothes, and made no attempt at retaliation at all -- merely muttering a few words about "taking summary vengeance at the first convenient opportunity," -- a natural and very justifiable ebullition of anger, which meant nothing, however, and, beyond doubt, was no sooner given vent to than forgotten.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拉特伯勒的人民确实对“老查理”的智慧和判断力有很高的评价，因此他们中的大部分人都愿意同意他的意见，而不会像这位诚实的老绅士所说的那样，在“有什么事情发生之前”在这件事上引起轰动；我相信，毕竟，如果没有沙特尔沃西先生的侄子的非常可疑的干涉，这将是一种普遍的决心，他是一个有着非常放荡的习惯的年轻人，而且性格也相当坏。这个名叫潘尼费瑟的侄子，在“安静地躺着”这件事上，听不到任何类似的理由，但坚持要立即寻找“被谋杀者的尸体”。这就是他所用的表达方式；古德费罗先生当时尖锐地说，这是“一种独特的表达方式，“别再说了。”老查理的这句话也对人群产生了很大的影响，有人听到一个聚会的人非常感人地问道，“年轻的潘尼费瑟先生怎么会对他富有的叔叔失踪的所有情况都了如指掌，觉得有权断言显然，他叔叔是“一个被谋杀的人”。这时，人群中，特别是“老查理”和潘尼费瑟先生之间，发生了一些小小的争吵和争吵，尽管这一次的争吵并不是什么新鲜事，因为双方之间并没有任何善意。在过去的三四个月里，事情甚至发展到了这样的地步，彭尼费希尔先生实际上因为他叔叔的朋友在叔叔的家里被剥夺了一些所谓的过度自由，而把他叔叔的朋友撞倒了，而他的侄子就是其中的一个囚犯。据说，在这个场合，“老查理”表现得堪称楷模的温和和基督教慈善。他从打击中站了起来，调整了一下衣服，一点也不想报复——只是咕哝了几句“在第一个方便的机会就立即报仇”，这是一种自然的、非常正当的愤怒情绪，然而，这毫无意义，毫无疑问，他一发泄就被遗忘了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">However these matters may be, (which have no reference to the point now at issue,) it is quite certain that the people of Rattleborough, principally through the persuasion of Mr. Pennifeather, came at length to the determination of dispersing over the adjacent country in search of the missing Mr. Shuttleworthy. I say they came to this determination in the first instance. After it had been fully resolved that a search should be made, it was considered almost a matter of course that the seekers should disperse -- that is to say, distribute themselves in parties -- for the more thorough examination of the region round about. I forget, however, by what ingenious train of reasoning it was that "Old Charley" finally convinced the assembly that this was the most injudicious plan that could be pursued. Convince them, however, he did -- all except Mr. Pennifeather; and, in the end, it was arranged that a search should be instituted, carefully and very thoroughly, by the burghers en masse, "Old Charley" himself leading the way.</div>

<div class="line_en">As for the matter of that, there could have been no better pioneer than "Old Charley," whom every body knew to have the eye of a lynx; but, although he led them into all manner of out-of-the-way holes and corners, by routes that nobody had ever suspected of existing in the neighbourhood, and although the search was incessantly kept up day and night for nearly a week, still no trace of Mr. Shuttleworthy could be discovered. When I say no trace, however, I must not be understood to speak literally; for trace, to some extent, there certainly was. The poor gentleman had been tracked, by his horse's shoes, (which were peculiar,) to a spot about three miles to the east of the borough, on the main road leading to the city. Here the track made off into a by-path through a piece of woodland -- the path coming out again into the main road and cutting off about half a mile of the regular distance. Following the shoe-marks down this lane, the party came at length to a pool of stagnant water, half hidden by the brambles, to the right of the lane, and opposite this pool all vestige of the track was lost sight of. It appeared, however, that a struggle of some nature had here taken place, and it seemed as if some large and heavy body, much larger and heavier than a man, had been dragged from the by-path to the pool. This latter was carefully dragged twice, but nothing was found; and the party were upon the point of going away, in despair of coming to any result, when Providence suggested to Mr. Goodfellow the expediency of draining the water off altogether. This project was received with cheers and many high compliments to "Old Charley" upon his sagacity and consideration. As many of the burghers had brought spades with them, supposing that they might possibly be called upon to disinter a corpse, the drain was easily and speedily effected; and no sooner was the bottom visible than right in the middle of the mud that remained was discovered a black silk velvet waistcoat, which nearly every one present immediately recognized as the property of Mr. Pennifeather. This waistcoat was much torn, and stained with blood, and there were several persons among the party who had a distinct remembrance of its having been worn by its owner on the very morning of Mr. Shuttleworthy's departure for the city; while there were others, again, ready to testify upon oath, if required, that Mr. P. did not wear the garment in question at any period during the remainder of that memorable day; nor could any one be found to say that he had seen it upon Mr. P.'s person at any period at all subsequent to Mr. Shuttleworthy's disappearance.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="关于这一点，没有比“老查理”更好的拓荒者了，每个人都知道他有一只猞猁的眼睛；但是，尽管他带领他们走到了各种各样的偏僻的角落里，尽管没有人怀疑这条路在附近存在过，尽管搜索一直在不断地进行着。一夜将近一个星期，仍然没有发现沙特尔沃斯先生的踪迹。然而，当我说“没有痕迹”的时候，我不应该被理解为按字面意思说话；在某种程度上，痕迹确实存在。这位可怜的绅士被他的马蹄铁（这是一种奇特的鞋子）跟踪到自治区以东大约三英里的一个地方，在通往城市的大路上。在这里，这条铁轨通过一片林地变成了一条小路——这条小路再次延伸到主路，切断了约半英里的正常距离沿着这条小巷的鞋印，一行人终于来到一滩死水，半藏在荆棘丛中，在小巷的右边，在这滩水的对面，所有的痕迹都看不见了然而，这里似乎发生了某种性质的搏斗，似乎有一个比人大得多、重得多的大而重的身体，从小路拖到了池边。后者被小心地拖了两次，但什么也没有找到；当上帝建议古德费罗先生把水全部排干时，那一伙人正准备离开，因为他们对任何结果都感到绝望。这个项目受到欢呼和许多高度赞扬“老查理”的睿智和考虑由于许多市民都随身带着铁锹，以为他们可能会被召唤去挖掘尸体，排水管就很容易迅速地打开了；而且，只要一看到底部，就在剩下的泥泞中发现了一件黑色丝绸天鹅绒背心，几乎在场的每一个人都立即承认这是彭尼费瑟先生的财产。这件马甲破得很厉害，沾满了血迹，一行人中有几个人清楚地记得，在沙特尔沃西先生去城里的那天早晨，它的主人穿了这件马甲；还有一些人，如果需要的话，也准备宣誓作证，说P先生没有穿这件马甲在那值得纪念的一天的剩余时间里的任何时候都有疑问；也没有人能说他在沙特尔沃西先生失踪之后的任何时候看到过P先生的人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Matters now wore a very serious aspect for Mr. Pennifeather, and it was observed, as an indubitable confirmation of the suspicions which were excited against him, that he grew exceedingly pale, and when asked what he had to say for himself, was utterly incapable of saying a word. Hereupon, the few friends his riotous mode of living had left him deserted him at once to a man, and were even more clamorous than his ancient and avowed enemies for his instantaneous arrest. But, on the other hand, the magnanimity of Mr. Goodfellow shone forth with only the more brilliant lustre through contrast. He made a warm and intensely eloquent defence of Mr. Pennifeather, in which he alluded more than once to his own sincere forgiveness of that wild young gentleman -- "the heir of the worthy Mr. Goodfellow [[Shuttleworthy]]," -- for the insult which he (the young gentleman) had, no doubt in the heat of passion, thought proper to put upon him (Mr. Goodfellow). "He forgave him for it," he said, "from the very bottom of his heart; and for himself (Mr. Goodfellow), so far from pushing the suspicious circumstances to extremity, which, he was sorry to say, really had arisen against Mr. Pennifeather, he (Mr. Goodfellow) would make every exertion in his power, would employ all the little eloquence in his possession to -- to -- to -- soften down, as much as he could conscientiously do so, the worst features of this really exceedingly perplexing piece of business."</div>

<div class="line_en">One of the most unaccountable errors committed by the orator was his allusion to the suspected as "the heir of the worthy old gentleman Mr. Shuttleworthy." The people had really never thought of this before. They had only remembered certain threats of disinheritance uttered a year or two previously by the uncle, (who had no living relative except the nephew;) and they had, therefore, always looked upon this disinheritance as a matter that was settled -- so single-minded a race of beings were the Rattleburghers; but the remark of "Old Charley" brought them at once to a consideration of this point, and thus gave them to see the possibility of the threats having been nothing more than a threat. And straightway, hereupon, arose the natural question of cui bono? -- a question that tended even more than the waistcoat to fasten the terrible crime upon the young man. And here, lest I be misunderstood, permit me to digress for one moment merely to observe that the exceedingly brief and simple Latin phrase which I have employed, is invariably mistranslated and misconceived. "Cui bono," in all the crack novels and elsewhere, -- in those of Mrs. Gore, for example, (the author of "Cecil,") a lady who quotes all tongues from the Chaldæan to Chickasaw, and is helped to her learning, "as needed," upon a systematic plan, by Mr. Beckford, -- in all the crack novels, I say, from those of Bulwer and Dickens to those of Turnapenny and Ainsworth, the two little Latin words cui bono are rendered "to what purpose," or, (as if quo bono,) "to what good." Their true meaning, nevertheless, is "for whose advantage." Cui, to whom; bono, is it for a benefit. It is a purely legal phrase, and applicable precisely in cases such as we have now under consideration, where the probability of the doer of a deed hinges upon the probability of the benefit accruing to this individual or to that from the deed's accomplishment. Now, in the present instance, the question cui bono very pointedly implicated Mr. Pennifeather. His uncle had threatened him, after making a will in his favour, with disinheritance. But the threat had not been actually kept; the original will, it appeared, had not been altered. Had it been altered, the only supposable motive for murder on the part of the suspected would have been the ordinary one of revenge; and even this would have been counteracted by the hope of reinstation into the good graces of the uncle. But the will being unaltered, while the threat to alter remained suspended over the nephew's head, there appears at once the very strongest possible inducement for the atrocity: and so concluded, very sagaciously, the worthy citizens of the borough of Rattle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="演说家犯下的一个最不可解释的错误是，他暗指嫌疑犯是“可敬的老绅士沙特尔沃西先生的继承人”。人们以前真的从来没有想过这一点他们只记得一两年前舅舅（除了侄子外，没有活人亲戚）发出的某些剥夺继承权的威胁，因此，他们一直把这种剥夺继承权看作是一个已经解决的问题——响尾蛇是如此专一的一个种族但是“老查理”的话立刻使他们想到了这一点，从而使他们明白了威胁只不过是一种威胁的可能性。就在这时，崔博诺的自然问题出现了？—一个比背心更倾向于把可怕的罪行强加给这个年轻人的问题。在这里，为了不被误解，请允许我稍微偏离一下，仅仅是为了观察到，我所使用的极其简短和简单的拉丁语短语，总是被误解和误解。“崔波诺”，在所有的限免小说和其他地方，—在戈尔夫人的小说中，例如，（《塞西尔》的作者，）一位引用了从迦勒底到奇卡索所有语言的女士，在贝克福德先生的系统计划下，在所有的限免小说中，我说，从布鲁尔和狄更斯到图纳潘尼和安斯沃思，这两个拉丁语单词“崔波诺”被翻译成“为了什么目的”，或者（仿佛“波诺”）为“什么好处”。然而，它们的真正含义是“为了谁”。崔，对谁；波诺，是为了一个好处。这是一个纯粹的法律用语，准确地适用于我们现在正在考虑的情况，其中一个契约的行为人的概率取决于该个人或该契约的完成所产生利益的概率。现在，在本案中，崔波诺的问题非常尖锐地牵涉到彭尼费瑟先生。他叔叔在立了一个对他有利的遗嘱后，曾威胁要剥夺他的继承权。但威胁实际上并没有被保留，原来的遗嘱似乎没有改变。如果这件事被改变了，嫌疑犯唯一可以支持的杀人动机就是普通的复仇动机；即使这样，也会被希望恢复叔叔的美貌所抵消。但是，尽管改变的威胁仍然悬在侄子的头上，但意志仍然没有改变，这一暴行似乎立刻出现了最强烈的可能诱因：因此，非常明智地得出结论，拉特市值得尊敬的市民。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So, in the present instance, it turned out with all the eloquence of "Old Charley;" for, although he laboured earnestly in behalf of the suspected, yet it so happened, somehow or other, that every syllable he uttered of which the direct but unwitting tendency was not to exalt the speaker in the good opinion of his audience, had the effect to deepen the suspicion already attached to the individual whose cause he pleaded, and to arouse against him the fury of the mob.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因此，在目前的情况下，结果以“老查理”的口才证明了这一点，因为尽管他为嫌疑犯辛勤工作，但不知何故，他所说的每一个音节，其直接但不知情的倾向，都不是要使演讲者得到听众的好评，结果加深了对他所请求的人的怀疑，激起了暴民的愤怒。">查看中文翻译</div>

The prisoner, being questioned as to his whereabouts on the morning of Mr. Shuttleworthy's disappearance, had absolutely the audacity to acknowledge that on that very morning he had been out with his rifle deer-stalking, in the immediate neighbourhood of the pool where the blood-stained waistcoat had been discovered through the sagacity of Mr. Goodfellow.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr. Pennifeather was, accordingly, arrested upon the spot, and the crowd, after some farther search, proceeded homewards, having him in custody. On the route, however, another circumstance occurred tending to confirm the suspicion entertained. Mr. Goodfellow, whose zeal led him to be always a little in advance of the party, was seen suddenly to run forward a few paces, stoop, and then apparently to pick up some small object from the grass. Having quickly examined it, he was observed, too, to make a sort of half attempt at concealing it in his coat pocket; but this action was noticed, as I say, and consequently prevented, when the object picked up was found to be a Spanish knife, which a dozen persons at once recognized as belonging to Mr. Pennifeather. Moreover, his initials were engraved upon the handle. The blade of this knife was open and bloody.</div>

He said that a stern sense of the duty he owed to his Maker, not less than to his fellow men, would permit him no longer to remain silent. Hitherto, the sincerest affection for the young man (notwithstanding the latter's ill treatment of himself, Mr. Goodfellow), had induced him to make every hypothesis which imagination could suggest, by way of endeavouring to account for what appeared suspicious in the circumstances that told so seriously against Mr. Pennifeather; but these circumstances were now altogether too convincing -- too damning; he would hesitate no longer -- he would tell all he knew, although his heart (Mr. Goodfellow's) should absolutely burst asunder in the effort. He then went on to state that, on the afternoon of the day previous to Mr. Shuttleworthy's departure for the city, that worthy old gentleman had mentioned to his nephew, in his hearing, (Mr. Goodfellow's,) that his object in going to town on the morrow was to make a deposit of an unusually large sum of money in the "Farmers [[Farmers']] and Mechanics' Bank," and that, then and there the said Mr. Shuttleworthy had distinctly avowed to the said nephew his irrevocable determination of rescinding the will originally made, and of cutting him off with a shilling.

<div class="line_en">At this juncture, it was announced that the horse of the murdered man had just expired in the stable from the effects of the wound he had received, and it was proposed by Mr. Goodfellow that a post mortem examination of the beast should be immediately made, with the view, if possible, of discovering the ball. This was accordingly done; and, as if to demonstrate beyond a question the guilt of the accused, Mr. Goodfellow, after considerable searching in the cavity of the chest, was enabled to detect and to pull forth a bullet of very extraordinary size, which, upon trial, was found to be exactly adapted to the bore of Mr. Pennifeather's rifle, while it was far too large for that of any other person in the borough or its vicinity. To render the matter even surer yet, however, this bullet was discovered to have a flaw or seam at right angles to the usual suture; and upon examination, this seam corresponded precisely with an accidental ridge or elevation in a pair of moulds acknowledged by the accused himself to be his own property. Upon the finding of this bullet, the examining magistrate refused to listen to any farther testimony, and immediately committed the prisoner for trial -- declining resolutely to take any bail in the case, although against this severity Mr. Goodfellow very warmly remonstrated, and offered to become surety in whatever amount might be required. This generosity on the part of "Old Charley" was only in accordance with the whole tenor of his amiable and chivalrous conduct during the entire period of his sojourn in the borough of Rattle. In the present instance, the worthy man was so entirely carried away by the excessive warmth of his sympathy, that he seemed to have quite forgotten, when he offered to go bail for his young friend, that he himself (Mr. Goodfellow) did not possess a single dollar's worth of property upon the face of the earth.</div>

He became ten times a greater favourite than ever; and, as a natural result of the hospitality with which he was treated, he relaxed, as it were, perforce, the extremely parsimonious habits which his poverty had hitherto impelled him to observe, and very frequently had little réunions at his own house, when wit and jollity reigned supreme -- dampened a little, of course, by the occasional remembrance of the untoward and melancholy fate which impended over the nephew of the late lamented bosom friend of the generous host.</div>

Not that he said any thing about "the good old Mr. Shuttleworthy" when he issued the invitations. The fact is, he thought much and concluded to say nothing at all. He did not mention to any one -- if I remember aright -- that he had received a present of Château-Margaux. He merely asked his friends to come and help him to drink some, of a remarkably fine quality and rich flavour, that he had ordered up from the city a couple of months ago, and of which he would be in the receipt upon the morrow.

<div class="line_en">The scene that ensued is altogether beyond description. The rush for the doors and windows was terrific, and many of the most robust men in the room fainted outright through sheer horror. But after the first wild, shrieking burst of affright, all eyes were directed to Mr. Goodfellow. If I live a thousand years, I can never forget the more than mortal agony which was depicted in that ghastly face of his, so lately rubicund with triumph and wine. For several minutes, he sat rigidly as a statue of marble; his eyes seeming, in the intense vacancy of their gaze, to be turned inwards and absorbed in the contemplation of his own miserable, murderous soul. At length, their expression appeared to flash suddenly out into the external world, when, with a quick leap, he sprang from his chair, and falling heavily with his head and shoulders upon the table, and in contact with the corpse, poured out rapidly and vehemently a detailed confession of the hideous crime for which Mr. Pennifeather was then imprisoned and doomed to die.</div>

<div class="line_en">After some vociferation, quiet was at length fully restored, and, as very often happens in similar cases, a profound and remarkable silence ensued. Being then requested to force open the lid, I complied, of course, "with an infinite deal of pleasure." I inserted a chisel, and giving it a few slight taps with a hammer, the top of the box flew suddenly and violently off, and, at the same instant, there sprang up into a sitting position, directly facing the host, the bruised, bloody and nearly putrid corpse of the murdered Mr. Shuttleworthy himself. It gazed for a few moments, fixedly and sorrowfully, with its decaying and lack-lustre eyes, full into the countenance of Mr. Goodfellow; uttered slowly, but clearly and impressively, the words -- "Thou art the man!" and then, falling over the side of the chest as if thoroughly satisfied, stretched out its limbs quiveringly upon the table.</div>

<div class="line_en">The means by which this happily-timed confession was extorted, although efficient, were simple indeed. Mr. Goodfellow's excess of frankness had disgusted me, and excited my suspicion from the first. I was present when Mr. Pennifeather had struck him, and the fiendish expression which then arose upon his countenance, although momentary, assured me that his threat of vengeance would, if possible, be rigidly fulfilled. I was thus prepared to view the manœuvering of "Old Charley" in a very different light from that in which it was regarded by the good citizens of Rattleborough. I saw at once that all the criminating discoveries arose, either directly or indirectly, from himself. But the fact which clearly opened my eyes to the true state of the case, was the affair of the bullet, found by Mr. G. in the carcass of the horse. I had not forgotten, although the Rattleburghers had, that there was a hole where the ball had entered the horse, and another where it went out. If it were found in the animal then, after having made its exit, I saw clearly that it must have been deposited by the person who found it. The bloody shirt and handkerchief confirmed the idea suggested by the bullet; for the blood upon examination proved to be capital claret, and no more. When I came to think of these things, and also of the late increase of liberality and expenditure on the part of Mr. Goodfellow, I entertained a suspicion which was none the less strong because I kept it altogether to myself.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the mean time, I instituted a rigorous private search for the corpse of Mr. Shuttleworthy, and, for good reasons, searched in quarters as divergent as possible from those to which Mr. Goodfellow conducted his party. The result was that, after some days, I came across an old dry well, the mouth of which was nearly hidden by brambles; and here, at the bottom, I discovered what I sought.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="同时，我对沙特尔沃西先生的尸体进行了严格的私人搜查，出于正当理由，我在尽可能不同于古德费罗先生所领导的政党的地方进行了搜查。结果，过了几天，我发现了一口干井，井口几乎被荆棘遮住了，在井底，我发现了我要找的东西。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now it so happened that I had overheard the colloquy between the two cronies, when Mr. Goodfellow had contrived to cajole his host into the promise of a box of Château-Margaux. Upon this hint I acted. I procured a stiff piece of whalebone, thrust it down the throat of the corpse, and deposited the latter in an old wine box -- taking care so to double the body up as to double the whalebone with it. In this manner I had to press forcibly upon the lid to keep it down while I secured it with nails; and I anticipated, of course, that as soon as these latter were removed, the top would fly off and the body fly up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时我碰巧听到了两位亲信的谈话，这时古德费罗先生设法哄骗主人答应要一盒玛歌沙茶。根据这一暗示，我采取了行动。我弄了一块僵硬的鲸骨，把它塞到尸体的喉咙里，然后把尸体放在一个旧酒盒里——小心地把尸体翻起来，好让它把鲸骨翻一番我用钉子固定盖子的时候，不得不用力按盖子，把它压下去；当然，我预料到，一旦把后者取下来，盖子就会飞起来，身体就会飞起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Having thus arranged the box, I marked, numbered and addressed it as already told; and then writing a letter in the name of the wine merchants with whom Mr. Shuttleworthy dealt, I gave instructions to my servant to wheel the box to Mr. Goodfellow's door, in a barrow, at a given signal from myself. For the words which I intended the corpse to speak, I confidently depended upon my ventriloquial abilities; for their effect, I counted upon the conscience of the murderous wretch.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我把箱子整理好后，按事先说的做了记号、编号和地址，然后以沙特尔沃西先生与之打交道的酒商的名义写了一封信，指示我的仆人在我发出信号的情况下，用手推车把箱子推到古德费罗先生的门前对于我想让尸体说的话，我自信地依赖于我的腹语能力；对于它们的效果，我依赖于那个杀人犯的良心。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I believe there is nothing more to be explained. Mr. Pennifeather was released upon the spot, inherited the fortune of his uncle, profited by the lessons of experience, turned over a new leaf, and led happily ever afterwards a new life.</div>
