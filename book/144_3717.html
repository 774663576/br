<div class="line_en">Cross flew from Vegas to L. A., rented a car, and arrived at the Malibu Colony guarded gatehouse as the sun began to fall into the ocean. There was no longer any special security, though there was still the secretary in the guest house who checked and buzzed him in. He walked through the longitudinal garden to the house on the beach. There was still the little South American maid, who led him to the sea-green living room that seemed just out of reach of the Pacific Ocean waves.</div>

<div class="line_en">Athena was waiting for him, and she was even more beautiful than he remembered. She was dressed in a green blouse and slacks, and she seemed to melt and become part of the mist over the ocean behind her. He could not take his eyes off her. She shook his hand in greeting, not the usual Hollywood kiss on both cheeks. She had drinks ready and she handed him one. It was Evian water with lime. They sat in the large, mint green upholstered chairs that faced the ocean. The descending sun scattered gold coins of light in the room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="安提娜在等着他，她甚至比记忆中还要漂亮。她的上衣是绿色的，宽大的裤子也是绿色，看起来似乎要融化在身后的万顷碧波之中。他无法把视线从她身上移开。她亲切地跟他握了手，没有像好莱坞通行的那样吻他的双颊。她已经准备了加了酸橙的“依云”矿泉水，递给他一杯。他们坐在薄荷绿色的宽椅子里，面朝大海，夕阳西下，屋子里洒下一地碎金。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The sound of her voice further entranced Cross. It was not sultry or inviting. But it had such a velvet tone, it had such regal confidence and yet was so warm, that he just wanted her to keep talking. Jesus Christ, he thought, what the hell is this? He was ashamed of her power over him. His head still down, he murmured, "I thought I could get you back to work by appealing to your greed."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克罗斯更加心醉神迷。她的声音不撩拨，也不诱人，但那天鹅绒一般柔软细腻的声调，既带着雍容，又那么温和。他只想听她再多说一点。天哪，他想，我这到底是怎么了？他感到羞耻，自己面对她的时候竟然如此不能自持。他仍然低着头，喃喃道：“我以为满足你的贪婪，你就会回来工作。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Cross was so aware of her beauty that he had to bow his head to avoid looking at her. The golden helmet of hair, the creamy skin, the way her long body sprawled in her chair. Some of the gold coins fell into her green eyes, fleeting shadows. He felt an urgent desire to touch her, to be closer to her, to own her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的美如此强烈地侵袭着克罗斯，他不得不低下头，不去看她的金发、奶油色肌肤和慵懒地卧在椅子里的样子，夕阳映着她碧绿的眼睛，光影转瞬即逝。一种急切的欲望在他心头燃起，他想抚摸她，想亲近她，想占有她。">查看中文翻译</div>

"Claudia told me the Studio reneged on their deal once my husband killed himself. You had to give them back the picture and take a percentage."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我的缺点不少，不过这一项不算。”安提娜说。她不再望着窗外的汪洋，而是转过头来，凝视他的眼睛，“克劳迪娅告诉我说，我丈夫刚一自杀，公司就反悔你们的交易了。你必须把电影还给他们，只拿分成。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Cross felt a thrill that she would do that for him. He considered the offer. The Studio might still take him to court. Also, he could not bear to make Athena put him in her debt.

<div class="line_cn" title="克罗斯一阵兴奋。她竟然肯为了他这么做。他思考着这个建议。这样的话，电影公司仍然会把他告上法庭。而且，他不想接受安提娜的帮助。他突然想到，虽然安提娜很美，但这可不意味着她不聪明。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Athena got up from her chair and moved to stand close to the picture window. The beaches were gray shadows, the sun had disappeared, and the ocean seemed to reflect the mountain ranges behind her house and the Pacific Coast Highway. She gazed out toward the now blue-black water, the small waves rippling in slyly. She did not turn her head to him when she said, "Why would I do that? Simply because I knew Boz Skannet better than anybody. And I don't care if he left a hundred suicide notes, he would never kill himself."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="安提娜从椅子上起身，站在观景窗旁边。沙滩变成了一片灰影，太阳已经消失不见，海水朦胧地映出了她屋子后面的山峦和太平洋海岸公路。她出神地注视着已经变成深蓝色的海水，和在海面上顽皮地翻涌的细浪。她并没回头看他，说道：“我为什么肯呢？因为我比谁都要了解博兹·斯堪尼特，就算他留下一百封绝笔信我也不信他会自杀。”">查看中文翻译</div>

You're my candidate as the killer." Even stern, her face was so beautiful to Cross that his voice was not as steady as he would have wished.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没错。”安提娜说。她转过身，直视他的眼睛，“可是你买下了电影，博兹恰巧就自杀了。你有凶手的嫌疑。”哪怕是表情冷峻的时候，克罗斯也觉得她如此美丽。克罗斯竭力想稳住自己的声调，却无法完全随心所愿。">查看中文翻译</div>

When I heard about you buying the picture, I knew exactly what you would do, but I must say I didn't think you could be so clever."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="安提娜摇了摇头。“我要的是什么他们都明白，就跟你一样明白。可他们没有那么做，而是把电影卖给了你。他们才不在乎片子拍完之后我会不会死，但是你在乎。甚至就在你说帮不了忙的时候，我就知道你会的。当我听说你买了电影之后，我就知道你要做什么了。我没想到你做得这么绝妙。”">查看中文翻译</div>

I'm not being immodest, I know I'm beautiful, people have been telling me that since I was a child. I always knew I had power, but I could never really understand that power. I'm not really happy with it but I use it. What they call "love"."</div>

<div class="line_en">His first reaction was one of anger, that she could think she could just buy him off. That she was acting a part, using her skill as a woman the same way a man would use physical force. But what really bothered him was that he could hear a faint bit of mockery in her voice. Mockery of his gallantry, and turning his true love into a simple screw. As if she was telling him that his love for her was as fake as her love for him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的第一个反应是生气，她竟然觉得这样就可以收买他。她这是在逢场作戏，是在施展女人特有的手段，跟男人们用暴力解决问题一样。可真正让他难受的是，他听出安提娜的口气里隐约带着一丝嘲弄。她在嘲弄他的大献殷勤，把他的真爱贬成了简单的求欢。她仿佛是说她对他的爱是假的，就像他对她的爱一样假。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="看到她的惊异，他感到一阵愉悦。她说：“我没数过，不过确实很多。那时我十八岁，而且那时我是真的爱他。可如今我竟然要他死。多可笑啊，不是吗？”她皱起了双眉，过了一会儿又漫不经心地问，“还跟你说什么了？”">查看中文翻译</div>

Cross with every touch yearned to feel her body on his. By the end of the meal, he no longer could taste what he was eating. Finally they were done and Athena took him by the hand and led him out of the kitchen and up the two flights of stairs to her bedroom.

There was a group of three or four adults standing around watching them, but something seemed odd about the scene.

I thought maybe she had a brain tumor, I remembered when Boz had let her fall on the floor, that maybe her brain had been injured and it was now beginning to show. For months after that I brought her to doctors, she underwent a battery of tests of all kinds, I took her to specialists and they checked everything. Then someone, and I don't remember whether it was the doctor in Boston or the psychiatrist in Texas Children's Hospital, told me she was autistic. I didn't even know what that meant except that I thought it was some kind of retardation. "No," the doctor said. It meant she lived in her own world, was unaware of other people's existence, had no interest in them, could feel nothing for anything or anyone.

The doctors told me it had nothing to do with Boz dropping her on her head or me deserting her, but I don't know if I believe that.

<div class="line_cn" title="“法国有个特殊医疗诊所，有个非常好的医生，”安提娜说，“我打算拍完这部电影就到那去。博兹出现的时候，我知道他要杀了我，那贝萨妮就没有任何能依靠的人了。所以我才想到用斯堪尼特的命做回来拍戏的条件。她谁也没有，只有我。所以为了她，我愿意承担这种罪恶。”安提娜顿了片刻，朝克罗斯笑了笑，“比肥皂剧还烂俗套，是不是？”她露出一丝微笑来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Athena laughed. "That's what gives me hope," she said. "Sad, isn't it? It's a hug box. A lot of autistic children use it when they get depressed. It's just like a hug from a person but they don't have to connect or relate to another human being." Athena took a deep breath and said, "Cross, someday I'm going to take the place of that box. That's the whole purpose of my life now. My life has no meaning except for that. Isn't that funny? The Studio tells me that I get thousands of letters from people who love me. In public people want to touch me. Men keep telling me they love me. Everybody but Bethany, and she's the only one I want."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="安提娜笑了起来。“就是那个东西给了我一线希望，”她说，“多可悲，不是吗？那就是个大箱子。很多自闭症的孩子在感到情绪低落的时候就会用它。它用起来就好像有人在拥抱你，你不必跟任何人有接触。”安提娜深吸一口气，接着说道，“克罗斯，总有一天我会取代那只箱子。如今这就是我全部的生活目标。除此之外，我的生命毫无意义。是不是很滑稽？公司告诉我说给我写信求爱的人有成百上千，在公共场合总有人想要触摸我。那么多人都在告诉我说他们爱我。每个人都是这样，只有贝萨妮不是，可她却是我唯一在乎的人。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="这辈子最出乎她意料的一个发现是，虽然她聪明又美丽（而且她自嘲地想，她还很和善、优雅、大方），她的那些密友、爱她的男人、羡慕她的亲戚，却有时候会因她的不幸而感到庆幸。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So though she knew the power of her beauty and used that power, she despised it. She longed for the day when lines would cut deep into her perfect face, each showing a path she had taken, a journey survived, when her body would fill out, soften and enlarge her to provide comfort for those she'd hold and care for, and her eyes would grow more liquid with mercy from all the suffering she'd witnessed and all the tears she'd never shed. She'd grow smile lines around her mouth from laughing at herself, and at life itself. How free she would be when she no longer feared the consequences of her physical beauty and instead delighted in its loss as it was replaced by a more enduring serenity.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以，她深知美貌的力量，也擅长利用它，她却憎恶这种力量。她期待有一天，皱纹会深深地刻进她完美的面庞之中，每条皱纹都显示出她选择的道路和艰辛的旅途。她期待自己有一天发福、松弛，那时候她丰满的体形可以为她在乎的人遮风挡雨；见到那么痛苦的遭遇之后，她的眼睛会因为曾经未能流下的眼泪而更加清澈，满是怜悯。那时她嘴角的笑纹会慢慢漾开，因为她嘲笑自己、嘲笑生活。若是能不再惧怕美丽的外表所带来的后果，而是欣然接受青春不再，取而代之享受持久安宁，那是多么自由。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One of the reasons she loved Claudia was because Claudia had never betrayed her with that look.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她喜欢克劳迪娅的原因之一就是，克劳迪娅从没辜负她，从没有过这样的表情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was why she kept Bethany so secret from her day-to-day life. She hated the idea that people she loved would have that fleeting look of satisfaction, that she had been punished for her own beauty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正因如此，贝萨妮的存在是个秘密，避开了她的日常生活。她讨厌看到所爱的人眼中那种满足，仿佛她因自己的美貌而受到了惩罚。">查看中文翻译</div>

She knew he was helplessly in love with her and she saw he did not have that certain look of satisfaction when he knew of her misfortune with Bethany.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因此，在克罗斯·德·莱纳见到贝萨妮的时候，她一直在关注他的一举一动。她看到他起先有所退缩，很快就恢复了正常。她知道，他这是无可救药地爱上她了；而且她看见，在他知道她和贝萨妮的不幸时，他的脸上并没有那种幸灾乐祸的表情。">查看中文翻译</div>
