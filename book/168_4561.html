<div class="line_en">A good heart. I have a good heart. Hysterical laughter rose up her gullet, but Sansa choked it back down. The bells were ringing, slow and mournful. Ringing, ringing, ringing. They had rung for King Robert the same way. Joffrey was dead, he was dead, he was dead, dead, dead. Why was she crying, when she wanted to dance? Were they tears of joy?</div>

<div class="line_en">The gods are just, thought Sansa. Robb had died at a wedding feast as well. It was Robb she wept for. Him and Margaery. Poor Margaery, twice wed and twice widowed. Sansa slid her arm from a sleeve, pushed down the gown, and wriggled out of it. She balled it up and shoved it into the bole of an oak, shook out the clothing she had hidden there. Dress warmly, Ser Dontos had told her, and dress dark. She had no blacks, so she chose a dress of thick brown wool. The bodice was decorated with freshwater pearls, though. The cloak will cover them. The cloak was a deep green, with a large hood. She slipped the dress over her head, and donned the cloak, though she left the hood down for the moment. There were shoes as well, simple and sturdy, with flat heels and square toes. The gods heard my prayer, she thought. She felt so numb and dreamy. My skin has turned to porcelain, to ivory, to steel. Her hands moved stiffly, awkwardly, as if they had never let down her hair before. For a moment she wished Shae was there, to help her with the net.</div>

<div class="line_en">When she pulled it free, her long auburn hair cascaded down her back and across her shoulders. The web of spun silver hung from her fingers, the fine metal glimmering softly, the stones black in the moonlight. Black amethysts from Asshai. One of them was missing. Sansa lifted the net for a closer look. There was a dark smudge in the silver socket where the stone had fallen out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后她终于成功，浓密的褐红秀发随之垂下肩膀，披散到背上。手中发网闪烁着淡淡的光芒，银丝十分悦目，宝石却是黑色。亚夏的黑紫晶。仔细查看，珊莎发觉丢了一颗，丝线交接处有颗结晶不知所踪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A sudden terror filled her. Her heart hammered against her ribs, and for an instant she held her breath. Why am I so scared, it's only an amethyst, a black amethyst from Asshai, no more than that. It must have been loose in the setting, that's all. It was loose and it fell out, and now it's lying somewhere in the throne room, or in the yard, unless…</div>

<div class="line_en">Ser Dontos had said the hair net was magic, that it would take her home. He told her she must wear it tonight at Joffrey's wedding feast. The silver wire stretched tight across her knuckles. Her thumb rubbed back and forth against the hole where the stone had been. She tried to stop, but her fingers were not her own. Her thumb was drawn to the hole as the tongue is drawn to a missing tooth. What kind of magic? The king was dead, the cruel king who had been her gallant prince a thousand years ago. If Dontos had lied about the hair net, had he lied about the rest as well? What if he never comes? What if there is no ship, no boat on the river, no escape? What would happen to her then?</div>

"Tyrion poisoned him?" Her dwarf husband had hated his nephew, she knew. Could he truly have killed him? Did he know about my hair net, about the black amethysts? He brought Joff wine. How could you make someone choke by putting an amethyst in their wine? If Tyrion did it, they will think I was part of it as well, she realized with a start of fear. How not?

<div class="line_en">He was so drunk that sometimes Sansa had to lend him her arm to keep him from falling. The bells were ringing out across the city, more and more of them joining in. She kept her head down and stayed in the shadows, close behind Dontos. While descending the serpentine steps he stumbled to his knees and retched. My poor Florian, she thought, as he wiped his mouth with a floppy sleeve. Dress dark, he'd said, yet under his brown hooded cloak he was wearing his old surcoat; red and pink horizontal stripes beneath a black chief bearing three gold crowns, the arms of House Hollard. "Why are you wearing your surcoat? Joff decreed it was death if you were caught dressed as a knight again, he… oh…" Nothing Joff had decreed mattered any longer.</div>

<div class="line_en">They continued down the serpentine and across a small sunken courtyard. Ser Dontos shoved open a heavy door and lit a taper. They were inside a long gallery. Along the walls stood empty suits of armor, dark and dusty, their helms crested with rows of scales that continued down their backs. As they hurried past, the taper's light made the shadows of each scale stretch and twist. The hollow knights are turning into dragons, she thought.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们继续走完楼梯，随后穿越一个凹陷的小庭院。唐托斯爵士推开一道厚门，点燃蜡烛，领她走进荒废的回廊。墙边矗立着一副副空洞的铠甲，黝黑蒙尘，从头盔直到背部镶着龙鳞。他们快步通过，蜡烛的光芒映照在鳞片上，扭曲着它们。仿佛千万个龙骑士死而复生，她心想。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One more stair took them to an oaken door banded with iron. "Be strong now, my jonquil, you are almost there." When Dontos lifted the bar and pulled open the door, Sansa felt a cold breeze on her face, She passed through twelve feet of wall, and then she was outside the castle, standing at the top of the cliff.

<div class="line_en">Sansa dared not look down. She kept her eyes on the face of the cliff, making certain of each step before reaching for the next. The stone was rough and cold. Sometimes she could feel her fingers slipping, and the handholds were not as evenly spaced as she would have liked. The bells would not stop ringing. Before she was halfway down her arms were trembling and she knew that she was going to fall. One more step, she told herself, one more step. She had to keep moving. If she stopped, she would never start again, and dawn would find her still clinging to the cliff, frozen in fear. One more step, and one more step.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="珊莎不敢往下瞧，只把岩壁死死盯住，踩好一步再踏一步。石头冰冷粗糙，她时时觉得手指往下滑，凹洞也根本不够大。钟声持续。没爬到一半，人已发起抖来，感觉随时可能摔下去。再一步，她告诉自己，再一步。她勉强前进，因为如果停下，一定会僵在原地，直到天亮都不肯移动，活活冻死在寒风里。再一步，再一步。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ser Dontos disappeared. She could hear him huffing and puffing as he began the descent. Sansa listened to the tolling of the bell, counting each ring. At ten, gingerly, she eased herself over the edge of the cliff, poking with her toes until they found a place to rest. The castle walls loomed large above her, and for a moment she wanted nothing so much as to pull herself up and run back to her warm rooms in the Kitchen Keep. Be brave, she told herself. Be brave, like a lady in a song.</div>

<div class="line_en">"No names," the man said. "In the boat." He sat hunched over his oars, an old man, tall and gangling, with long white hair and a great hooked nose, with eyes shaded by a cowl. "Get in, be quick about it," he muttered. "We need to be away."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“别说话！”对方回答，“快上船。”这人拿撑篙当坐垫，生得高大瘦长，却是个老者，有长长白发和大鹰勾鼻，眼神被头巾遮掩。“进来，动作快，”他喃喃道，“我们快迟到了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The ground took her by surprise. She stumbled and fell, her heart pounding. When she rolled onto her back and stared up at from where she had come, her head swam dizzily and her fingers clawed at the dirt. I did it. I did it, I didn't fall, I made the climb and now I'm going home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到达底部时，她不禁吃了一惊，随即绊倒在地，心脏狂跳。她蜷起身子，抬头望着来路，只觉头晕目眩，指甲抠进泥中。我做到了，我竟然做到了！我没有摔下来！我下来了，我可以回家了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When both of them were safe aboard, the cowled man slid the blades into the water and put his back into the oars, rowing them out toward the channel. Behind them the bells were still tolling the boy king's death. They had the dark river all to themselves. With slow, steady, rhythmic strokes, they threaded their way downstream, sliding above the sunken galleys, past broken masts, burned hulls, and torn sails. The oarlocks had been muffled, so they moved almost soundlessly. A mist was rising over the water. Sansa saw the embattled ramparts of one of the Imp's winch towers looming above, but the great chain had been lowered, and they rowed unimpeded past the spot where a thousand men had burned. The shore fell away, the fog grew thicker, the sound of the bells began to fade. Finally even the lights were gone, lost somewhere behind them. They were out in Blackwater Bay, and the world shrank to dark water, blowing mist, and their silent companion stooped over the oars. "How far must we go?" she asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两人均安全上船后，戴头巾的老人将撑篙滑入水中，用尽全身力气，将船向河口摆去。丧钟依然为死去的国王持续鸣奏，黑色的河水围绕小舟。随着撑篙坚定、缓慢而有节律地拍打，他们愈行愈远，经过沉没的舰艇、破损的桅杆、烧焦的船壳和分裂的风帆。撑篙的叶片包了布，小舟几乎没发出任何声响。薄雾在河面升起，小恶魔的绞盘塔隐约出现在前方，好在拦江铁索已然放下，他们顺利通过了那成千上万活人被烧死的地方。河岸已不复见，雾气越来越浓，钟声缓缓褪散，最后连灯火亮光全部消失，一叶扁舟深入黑水湾。全世界只剩下漆黑无边的水，漂浮不定的雾和两位沉默不语的伙伴，“还有多远？”她问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ser Dontos pulled her back onto her feet. "This way. Quiet now, quiet, quiet." He stayed close to the shadows that lay black and thick beneath the cliffs. Thankfully they did not have to go far. Fifty yards downriver, a man sat in a small skiff, half-hidden by the remains of a great galley that had gone aground there and burned. Dontos limped up to him, puffing. "Oswell?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="唐托斯爵士扶她起立，“这边走，安静，安静，千万安静。”他领她走进悬崖底深邃的阴影里，向下游行了大约五十码，只见前方有条小舟，半掩藏在一只烧焦沉没的巨舰背后，一个男人正在舟中等待。唐托斯喘起粗气，蹒跚着去会他，“奥斯威尔？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No talk." The oarsman was old, but stronger than he looked, and his voice was fierce. There was something oddly familiar about his face, though Sansa could not say what it was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“别说话。”船夫虽然年迈，身体却有力量，声音也极凶悍。他的面容让珊莎觉得奇怪地熟悉，但说不上为什么。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The eastern sky was vague with the first hint of dawn when Sansa finally saw a ghostly shape in the darkness ahead; a trading galley, her sails furled, moving slowly on a single bank of oars. As they drew closer, she saw the ship's figurehead, a merman with a golden crown blowing on a great seashell horn. She heard a voice cry out, and the galley swung slowly about.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当东方的天空映出第一道曙光，蒙蒙发亮时，珊莎终于在黑暗中发现一个幽灵般的形体：似乎是艘商船，帆已收起，只靠一列木桨保持低速运动。靠近之后，她看见船首像乃是头戴金冠、吹奏海贝巨号角的男性人鱼。雾中一声号令，商船便朝小舟驶来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Not far." Ser Dontos took her hand in his own and rubbed it gently. "Your friend is near, waiting for you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不远了，”唐托斯爵士双手执起她的手，轻轻揉搓，“您的朋友在那边等您。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As they came alongside, the galley dropped a rope ladder over the rail. The rower shipped the oars and helped Sansa to her feet. "Up now. Go on, girl, I got you." Sansa thanked him for his kindness, but received no answer but a grunt. It was much easier going up the rope ladder than it had been coming down the cliff. The oarsman Oswell followed close behind her, while Ser Dontos remained in the boat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大船驶拢后，沿栏放下一道绳梯，船夫扔开撑篙，扶珊莎登上去，“去吧，上，孩子，有我在后面。”珊莎感谢他的帮助，对方却只咕哝了一声。爬绳梯总比爬悬崖容易，在她之后，这位叫奥斯威尔的船夫也登上大船，唐托斯爵士却没跟来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Abashed, Sansa bit her lip and huddled down in silence. The rest was rowing, rowing, rowing.</div>

<div class="line_en">Two sailors were waiting by the rail to help her onto the deck. Sansa was trembling. "She's cold," she heard someone say. He took off his cloak and put it around her shoulders. "There, is that better, my lady? Rest easy, the worst is past and done."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两名船员把她扶上甲板，珊莎有些发抖。“她着了凉，”某人评论，并把自己的斗篷解下，披到她肩膀，“来，好点了么，小姐？你好好歇息，一切都没事，你安全了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She knew the voice. But he's in the Vale, she thought. Ser Lothor Brune stood beside him with a torch.</div>

<div class="line_en">Lothor Brune dipped his torch. Three men stepped to the gunwale, raised crossbows, fired. One bolt took Dontos in the chest as he looked up, punching through the left crown on his surcoat. The others ripped into throat and belly. It happened so quickly neither Dontos nor Sansa had time to cry out. When it was done, Lothor Brune tossed the torch down on top of the corpse. The little boat was blazing fiercely as the galley moved away.</div>

The gold cloaks will hunt, and the eunuch will jingle his purse. Dontos… well, you heard him. He sold you for gold, and when he'd drunk it up he would have sold you again. A bag of dragons buys a man's silence for a while, but a well-placed quarrel buys it forever." He smiled sadly. "All he did he did at my behest. I dared not befriend you openly. When I heard how you saved his life at Joff 's tourney, I knew he would be the perfect catspaw.</div>

<div class="line_en">The thought made her tummy flutter. She might never need to share a bed with Tyrion again. That was what she'd wanted… wasn't it? The cabin was low and cramped, but a featherbed had been laid upon the narrow sleeping shelf to make it more comfortable, and thick furs piled atop it. "It will be snug, I know, but you shouldn't be too uncomfortable." Littlefinger pointed out a cedar chest under the porthole. "You'll find fresh garb within. Dresses, smallclothes, warm stockings, a cloak. Wool and linen only, I fear. Unworthy of a maid so beautiful, but they'll serve to keep you dry and clean until we can find you something finer."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“为什么我却要他死？”小指头耸耸肩，“别傻了，小姐，我没有动机。你瞧，我远在千里之外，什么也做不了。记住，永远都要让你的敌人迷惑，永远都要让他们猜不透你的打算、看不清你的为人，这样你真正的目的就不会暴露。很多时候，最好的办法就是做一些没有明显好处的事，甚至是一些表面上看来有损于自己利益的事。珊莎，当你日后加入到游戏中来时，请记得这第一课。”">查看中文翻译</div>
