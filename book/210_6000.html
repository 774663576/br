<div class="line_en">Her story came to an end. She had not raised her voice: she had not cried. But things seemed to change as the story progressed. The fire looked as if it was laughing at her troubles. All the objects around her appeared not to care about her tragic history. And yet it was only a short time since he had been kissing her. Everything looked different now.</div>

<div class="line_en">Clare stirred the fire. It was unnecessary, but he felt he had to do something. He had not really taken in the whole story yet. He stood up. Now as he began to understand the story in its full horror, his face was like an old man's. He made uncertain movements, because everything in his head was vague and uncertain. He could not make himself think clearly.</div>

<div class="line_en">Later on that night Clare also came back to the house. He prepared a bed downstairs, but crept shoeless upstairs to see if Tess was asleep. He was relieved to see her sleeping deeply. And yet he felt he alone had the whole worry of what action to take, and the responsibility for her life as well as his. He turned away from her door, and then turned back again, pulled by his love for her. But his eye was caught by a painting on the wall of one of Tess's ancestors, a proud fierce woman, who looked as if she hated and wanted to deceive all men. He thought she and Tess looked alike. That was enough to stop him, and he went downstairs to his lonely bed.</div>

<div class="line_en">He looked calm and cold, full of self-control. His face showed he had fought against passion and won, but did not like being the winner.

The night came in, unconcerned and uninterested, the night which had swallowed up his happiness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他看起来沉静又冷峻，充满了自制力。他的神情显示出他经历了一场与情欲的战斗，而且他赢了，但他却不喜欢成为这样一个胜者。他依然觉得他难以接受这个事实：苔丝，一个纯洁的乡村少女，竟不是她看起来的这样。生活有时是多么出乎意料啊！他熄灭了蜡烛。夜在漫不经心、漠然地一点点降临，就是这夜吞没了他的幸福和快乐。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She turned her back on him, sobbing as if her heart would break. It would have won round any man but Angel Clare.

She would never have thought of criticizing his hardness. To her he was still perfection.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“苔丝，你这是什么意思？当然了，你是我的妻子。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, just as you wish. I will do whatever you like." They sat down to breakfast, tired and sad. They did not look at each other and they did not eat much. Angel left soon afterwards to start his studies at the flour-mill nearby. Tess cleared the ashes from the fireplace, cleaned the house and prepared the lunch, waiting for his return. At lunch they talked politely of work at the flour-mill and methods of milling. In the afternoon he went back to the mill, and in the evening he studied his books and papers. Tess felt she was in his way and went to the kitchen. He came to find her there.</div>

<div class="line_en">Another day passed by in the same way. Only once did Tess try to get closer to her husband. As he was leaving for the flour-mill, she put up her mouth to be kissed. He ignored the invitation, and said goodbye coldly. She felt as if he had hit her. How often had he wanted to kiss her in those happy days at Talbothays!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="同样的生活又过去了一天。苔丝只尝试过一次去接近她的丈夫。他要离开到面粉厂去的时候，她凑上她的唇，等他吻她。他对她的主动表示不加理睬，只是冷冷地说了声再见。当时她的感觉就像挨了他的打。在塔尔勃塞那些快乐的日子里，他是多么经常地想要吻她啊！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She had hoped, as women do, that living together for a time would break down his coldness. Being near him every day was her only hope of winning him back.

<div class="line_en">So they both prepared to leave the following day. That night Tess was woken by a noise in the house. At first she thought Angel was coming to her bedroom, and her heart beat wildly with joy. But then she saw his eyes staring emptily ahead of him, and knew he was walking in his sleep.

She had given herself totally up to him, and did not care what happened to her as long as she was with him.

Angel's parents would have taken poor lonely Tess to their hearts immediately, as they did every other lost soul, without thought of family or education or wealth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苔丝匆匆地超过了他们，泪水从她脸上潸潸滚下。她继续尽可能快地走着，离开了爱敏斯特。她是多么不走运啊，碰见的偏偏会是两个儿子，而不是父亲。安吉尔的父母会立即打心底里接受孤苦可怜的苔丝，就像他们对每一个迷失的人做的那样，而不会去考虑他的出身、学识或财富。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She grew more and more tired and depressed as she walked the fifteen miles back to Flintcomb-Ash, where only hard work awaited her. But on the way she noticed a crowd listening to a preacher and she stopped for a while to join them. The preacher was describing with enthusiasm how he had been wicked for years and how a certain parson had pointed it out to him: this had gradually turned him from wickedness. But Tess was more shocked by the voice than the words. She moved round behind the crowd to look at his face. As the afternoon sun shone full on him, she recognized Alec D'Urberville.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Look, here's a pair of old boots," said one of the brothers, noticing Tess's boots behind the tree.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Excellent walking boots, I see," said Miss Chant. "How wicked to throw them away! Give them to me. I'll find a poor person who would like them."</div>
