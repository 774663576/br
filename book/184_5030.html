<div class="line_en">Rilian explained that there were quite a lot of outlets by which one could get to the surface; he had been taken out through most of them at one time or another. But he had never gone out alone, only with the Witch; and he had always reached these outlets by going in a ship across the Sunless Sea. What the Earthmen would say if he went down to the harbour without the Witch, and with four strangers, and simply ordered a ship, no one could guess. But most likely they would ask awkward questions. On the other hand the new outlet, the one for the invasion of Overworld, was on this side of the sea, and only a few miles away. The Prince knew that it was nearly finished; only a few feet of earth divided the diggings from the outer air. It was even possible that it had now been quite finished. Perhaps the Witch had come back to tell him this and to start the attack. Even if it was not, they could probably dig themselves out by that route in a few hours -- if they could only get there without being stopped, and if only they found the diggings unguarded. But those were the difficulties.</div>

<div class="line_en">All felt that they had earned what Scrubb called a "breather". The Witch had locked the door and told the Earthmen not to disturb her, so there was no danger of interruption for the present. Their first business was, of course, Puddleglum's burnt foot. A couple of clean shirts from the Prince's bedroom, torn into strips, and well greased on the inside with butter and salad oil off the supper table, made a fairly good dressing. When this had been applied, they all sat down and had a little refreshment, and discussed plans for escaping from the Underworld.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大家都觉得他们已经获得了斯克罗布所说的“片刻休息”。女巫刚才已经锁上了门，而且吩咐地下人别来打扰她。因此目前没有被人打扰的危险。他们的第一件事当然是照料普德格伦烧伤的那只脚。他们从王子卧室里拿来了两三件干净的衬衣，撕成一条条，里面涂上晚饭桌上的黄油和色拉油，就成了绝妙的敷料。敷好伤以后，他们都坐下吃了一些茶点，讨论逃出地下世界的计划。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I say," he asked, "what's that noise?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“喂，”他问，“那是什么声音？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The very first thing they noticed was a great red glow. Its reflection made a red patch on the roof of the Underworld thousands of feet above them, so that they could see a rocky ceiling which had perhaps been hidden in darkness ever since the world was made. The glow itself came from the far side of the city so that many buildings, grim and great, stood up blackly against it. But it also cast its light down many streets that ran from it towards the castle. And in those streets something very strange was going on. The closely-packed, silent crowds of Earthmen had vanished. Instead, there were figures darting about by ones, or twos, or threes. They behaved like people who do not want to be seen: lurking in shadow behind buttresses or in doorways, and then moving quickly across the open into fresh places of hiding. But the strangest thing of all, to anyone who knew the gnomes, was the noise. Shouts and cries came from all directions. But from the harbour there came a low, rumbling roar which grew steadily louder and was already shaking the whole city.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们注意到的第一件事就是一大片红光。红光在他们上面几千英尺高处地下世界顶部反射出一片红色，因此他们能看见一片岩石天花板，也许天花板从这个世界造好以来一直就隐蔽在黑暗中。那片红光来自城市的另一边，因此好多阴森森的大房子在红光衬托下黑压压地矗立着。但红光也照到很多从那儿通向城堡的街道，那些街道上正出了些怪事。那些挨挨挤挤、一声不吭的地下人群已经消失了。只见三三两两的人影到处冲来冲去。他们显得像人们不希望让人看见一样：偷偷潜伏在扶壁后的阴影里，或者门口，然后很快穿过空地，到新的隐蔽处去。但对任何了解这些小精灵的人来说，最奇怪的事就是声音。四面八方都传来吵吵嚷嚷的声音。不过从港口方面却传来一种低沉的隆隆吼声，逐渐变得更响，而且已经震撼了整个城市。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They had all, in fact, been hearing the noise but it had begun and increased so gradually that they did not know when they had first noticed it. For a time it had been only a vague disquiet like gentle winds, or traffic very far away. Then it swelled to a murmur like the sea. Then came rumblings and rushings. Now there seemed to be voices as well and also a steady roaring that was not voices.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="事实上他们全都一直听到这种声音，但这声音是逐步响起来的，因此他们不知道自己几时初次注意到这声音。有一段时间，那只是一种隐隐约约的骚动，像轻轻的风声，或是远处的人来车往声。随后就增强为海涛般的沙沙声。接着又传来了隆隆声和哗啦啦声。这会儿似乎还有说话声，还夹杂着一种不是说话声的连续吼声。">查看中文翻译</div>

By my head, the sea's rising. The flood is upon us. Aslan be praised, this castle stands on high ground. But the water comes on grimly fast."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“瞧，瞧！”王子说，“船已经开到港口这一边来了——船开到街上来了。瞧，所有的船都开进城来了！啊呀，海水上涨了。要发洪水了。赞美阿斯兰，这个城堡造在高地上。但海水涨起来快得要命。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'll tell you what it is," said Puddleglum. "That Witch has laid a train of magic spells so that whenever she was killed, at that same moment her whole kingdom would fall to pieces.

<div class="line_cn" title="“我告诉你是怎么回事吧。”普德格伦说，“那个女巫已经设下了一连串魔法咒语，因此无论什么时候她被杀了，她的王国同时也就崩溃了。要是她知道杀掉她的人五分钟以后就要被烧死，或活埋，或淹死，她那种坏蛋就是死也不在乎。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“说得对，沼泽怪朋友，”王子说，“当我们的剑砍下了女巫的脑袋，那一下就把她的一切魔法都结束了，如今幽深王国正在崩溃。我们正眼看着地下世界的末日呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Not by my counsel," said the Prince. "I would save my horse, Coalblack, and the Witch's Snowflake (a noble beast and worthy of a better mistress) which are both stabled in the courtyard. After that, let us make shift to get out to high ground and pray that we shall find an outlet. The horses can carry two each at need, and if we put them to it they may outstrip the flood."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“依我之见这不成，”王子说，“我要去救我的马黑炭，还有女巫的马雪花（那是一匹好马，值得找一个更好的女主人），这两匹马都在院子里的马厩里。过后，我们赶快骑着马到高地上去，但愿我们能找到一个出口。必要时一匹马可以骑两个人，要是我们骑着马，马也可以越过洪水。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Will your Highness not put on armour?" asked Puddleglum. "I don't like the look of those" -- and he pointed down to the street. Everyone looked down.

<div class="line_cn" title="“殿下不披上盔甲吗？”普德格伦问道，“我不喜欢那些东西的样子——”他朝街下指指，大家都朝下看。好多人（现在他们走近了，显然是地下人）正从港口方向走过来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Look, friends," he said, holding out the shield towards them. "An hour ago it was black and without device; and now, this." The shield had turned bright as silver, and on it, redder than blood or cherries, was the figure of the Lion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“瞧，朋友们，”他说着把盾举起来对着他们，“一小时以前盾还是黑的，没有纹章；现在啊，瞧这个。”那盾已经变得银光闪闪，上面还有比血、比樱桃更红的狮王图像。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Prince unlocked the door and they all went down the stairs: three of them with drawn swords, and Jill with drawn knife. The attendants had vanished and the great room at the foot of the Prince's stairs was empty. The grey, doleful lamps were still burning and by their light they had no difficulty in passing gallery after gallery and descending stairway after stairway. The noises from outside the castle were not so easily heard here as they had been in the room above. Inside the house all was still as death, and deserted. It was as they turned a corner into the great hall on the ground floor that they met their first Earthman -- a fat, whitish creature with a very piglike face who was gobbling up all the remains of food on the tables. It squealed (the squeal also was very like a pig's) and darted under a bench, whisking its long tail out of Puddleglum's reach in the nick of time. Then it rushed away through the far door too quickly to be followed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="王子打开了门，他们都走下楼去：三个拿着出鞘的剑，吉尔手里拿着出鞘的刀。那些随从都不见了，王子楼梯脚下那间大房间里空空荡荡。那些灰沉沉、阴森森的灯仍然亮着，借着灯光他们亳不费力地走过一条条走廊，走下一段又一段楼梯。城堡外面的声音在这儿倒不如他们在上面房间听得清楚。屋里寂静如死，空无一人。他们转了一个弯来到底层大厅时才遇到了第一个地下人——一个苍白的胖子，长着一张猪样的脸，正大口大口吃着桌上的残羹剩饭。它尖叫一声（叫声也很像猪叫），就冲到一条长凳下，长尾巴一挥，正好没让普德格伦抓住。随后它飞快地从另一边门冲了出去，追也追不上了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And they all did as the Prince had said. But when Scrubb shook hands with Jill, he said, "So long, Jill. Sorry I've been a funk and so ratty. I hope you get safe home," and Jill said, "So long, Eustace. And I'm sorry I've been such a pig." And this was the first time they had ever used Christian names, because one didn't do it at school.</div>

<div class="line_en">From the hall they came out into the courtyard. Jill, who went to a riding school in the holidays, had just noticed the smell of a stable (a very nice, honest, homely smell it is to meet in a place like Underland) when Eustace said, "Great Scott! Look at that!" A magnificent rocket had risen from somewhere beyond the castle walls and broken into green stars.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们从门厅来到院子。吉尔在假日里上过骑马学校，恰好闻到一股马厩的味儿（在地下世界这种地方闻到这种味儿，可真好闻，又纯正又亲切）。这时尤斯塔斯说，“天哪！看那边！”城堡墙后的什么地方升起了一股壮丽的焰火，碎裂成很多绿星星。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“朋友们，”王子说，“一旦一个人开始冒这么大的风险，就必须把希望和恐惧置之度外，否则死神或解脱都来不及保全他的荣誉和理智。嗬，我的美人儿（他打开了马厩门）。嗨，老朋友！黑炭，稳住。别出声，雪花！没有忘记你。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The horses were both frightened by the strange lights and the noises. Jill, who had been so cowardly about going through a black hole betweeen one cave and another, went in without fear between the stamping and snorting beasts, and she and the Prince had them saddled and bridled in a few minutes. Very fine they looked as they came out into the courtyard, tossing their heads. Jill mounted Snowflake, and Puddleglum got up behind her. Eustace got up behind the Prince on Coalblack. Then with a great echo of hoofs, they rode out of the main gateway into the street.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两匹马都被那些奇怪的亮光和闹声吓坏了。吉尔穿过山洞之间的黑洞时胆子那么小，现在却毫无畏惧地走到两匹又顿脚又喷鼻的牲口当中，她和王子一会儿就把马装好鞍子和笼头。两匹马牵出来时仰着头，看来十分神气。吉尔骑上雪花，普德格伦坐在她后面，尤斯塔斯跨上黑炭，坐在王子后面。然后只听得蹄声旷得旷得，他们就骑着马出了大门，向街上驰去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Not much danger of being burnt. That's the bright side of it," observed Puddleglum, pointing to their right. There, hardly a hundred yards away, lapping against the walls of the houses, was water.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“幸亏烧伤没什么大的危险。”普德格伦说，一面指着他们右面。那边，不到一百码以外，就有海水在拍打着屋子的墙壁了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Courage!" said the Prince. "The road there goes down steeply. That water has climbed only half up the greatest hill in the city. It might come so near in the first half-hour and come no nearer in the next two. My fear is more of that --" and he pointed with his sword to a great tall Earthman with boar's tusks, followed by six others of assorted shapes and sizes who had just dashed out of a side street and stepped into the shadow of the houses where no one could see them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“鼓起勇气！”王子说，“那边的下坡路陡，海水只升到城里最大一座山的半山腰。开头半小时海水离我们可能很近，接下来两小时就不会更近。我更担心的倒是……”他用剑指着一个身高七英尺的大个子地下人，那人长着一口獠牙，后面跟着另外六个各种形状、高矮不一的地下人，他们刚从一条小街里冲出来，躲进人们看不见的屋子的阴影里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Prince led them, aiming always in the direction of the glowing red light but a little to the left of it. His plan was to get round the fire (if it was a fire) on to high ground, in hope that they might find their way to the new diggings. Unlike the other three, he seemed to be almost enjoying himself. He whistled as he rode, and sang snatches of an old song about Corin Thunder-fist of Archenland. The truth is, he was so glad at being free from his long enchantment that all dangers seemed a game in comparison. But the rest found it an eerie journey.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="王子带领大家直奔那片红光的方向，但稍稍偏左一点，他的计划是绕过那片火（如果那是火的话），登上高地，希望能找到路通往新挖的出口。他跟其他三个人不同，似乎有点自得其乐。骑马时还吹着口哨，还唱起歌颂阿钦兰王国的霹雳拳击手柯林的一首老歌的片断。事实上他因为长期受魔法幽禁，一旦解脱出来感到十分高兴，相比之下，一切危险似乎只是儿戏了。但其他人都觉得这段路程阴森可怕。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Behind them was the sound of clashing and entangled ships, and the rumble of collapsing buildings. Overhead was the great patch of lurid light on the roof of the Underworld. Ahead was the mysterious glow, which did not seem to grow any bigger. From the same direction came a continual hubbub of shouts, screams, cat-calls, laughter, squeals, and bellowings; and fireworks of all sorts rose in the dark air. No one could guess what they meant. Nearer to them, the city was partly lit up by the red glow, and partly by the very different light of the dreary Gnome lamps.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们后面传来船只互相碰撞、缠绕的声音，建筑物倒下的轰隆隆声。头项是地下世界顶部那一大片火红的光。前面就是那神秘的红光，那光似乎并没有变得大些。从同一方向还不断传来吵闹、呼喊、尖叫、口哨、哄笑、惨叫、怒吼，闹成一片；黑夜中还升起各种各样的焰火。谁也猜不出这是什么意思。离他们近一点的地方，城市有部分地方被那片红光照亮，部分地方被那些大不相同的阴森森的小精灵的灯照亮。">查看中文翻译</div>

And in and out of those places the shapes of Earthmen were darting and slipping all the time, always with their eyes fixed on the travellers, always trying to keep out of sight themselves. There were big faces and little faces, huge eyes like fishes' eyes and little eyes like bears'. There were feathers and bristles, horns and tusks, noses like whipcord, and chins so long that they looked like beards. Every now and then a group of them would get too big or come too near. Then the Prince would brandish his sword and make a show of charging them. And the creatures, with all manner of hootings, squeakings, and cluckings, would dive away into the darkness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过还有很多地方两种光都照不到，仍然一片漆黑。地下人的身影就在那些地方不断地冲进去，溜出来，眼睛一直盯着这一行人，始终尽量避开他们的视线。那些人中有的是大脸，有的是小脸，有的长着鱼眼般的大眼睛，有的长着熊眼般的小眼睛，有长着羽毛的，有长着鬃毛的，有长角的，有长獠牙的，有的鼻子长得像鞭绳，有的下巴长得像胡子。有时遇上一群人人数太多，或者靠得太近。王子就挥舞宝剑，装出要打他们的架势。这些家伙就发出各种叫声，有的唬唬叫，有的叽叽叫，有的吱吱叫，然后蹿到黑暗中去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"That was my thought too, Puddleglum," said the Prince. "And we can never fight our way through so many. Hark you! Let us ride forth close by the edge of yonder house. And even as we reach it, do you slip off into its shadow. The Lady and I will go forward a few paces. Some of these devils will follow us, I doubt not; they are thick behind us. Do you, who have long arms, take one alive if you may, as it passes your ambush. We may get a true tale of it or learn what is their quarrel against us."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我也是这么想，普德格伦，”王子说，“我们休想从那么多人中杀出一条路来。你们听好！我们往前骑到靠那边房子跟前。我们刚走到，你就溜到阴影里。我和小姐就再往前走几步。我相信有些妖怪就会跟着我们；他们密密麻麻都躲在我们后面呢。你的手臂长，要是可能的话，碰到哪个经过你埋伏的地方，就抓一个活的。我们可以从它嘴里打听到真相，了解他们究竟跟我们有什么过不去的事。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But when they had climbed many steep streets and were far away from the flood, and almost out of the town on the inland side, it began to be more serious. They were now close to the red glow and nearly on a level with it, though they still could not see what it really was. But by its light they could see their enemies more clearly. Hundreds -- perhaps a few thousands -- of gnomes were all moving towards it. But they were doing so in short rushes, and whenever they stopped, they turned and faced the travellers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但等他们爬上一条又一条的陡峭街道，离洪水很远了，而且几乎出了城到内陆一边，事态变得更严重了。这会儿他们已经靠近这片红光，几乎和红光处在同一高度，可是他们仍然看不出这光是怎么回事。不过在这片光照下，他们能把敌人看得更清楚。成百个，也许有几千个小精灵都在朝红光走去。但他们走起路来蜂拥而上，一旦停下，他们就转身面对着这一行人。—">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Marsh-wiggle slipped off into the shadow as quickly as a cat. The others, for a sickening minute or so, went forward at a walk. Then suddenly from behind them there broke out a series of blood-curdling screams, mixed with the familiar voice of Puddleglum, saying, "Now then! Don't cry out before you're hurt, or you will be hurt, see? Anyone would think it was a pig being killed."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="沼泽怪像只猫似的迅速溜到阴影里去。其余的人熬过了一两分钟，又继续往前走。接着他们身后忽然传来一连串令人心惊胆战的尖叫声，夹杂着普德格伦那熟悉的声音在说，“行了，别叫了，免得伤着，不然你就真要伤着了，懂吗？人家听了还以为要杀猪呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That was good hunting," exclaimed the Prince, immediately turning Coalblack and coming back to the corner of the house. "Eustace," he said, "of your courtesy, take Coalblack's head." Then he dismounted, and all three gazed in silence while Puddleglum pulled his catch out into the light. It was a most miserable little gnome, only about three feet long. It had a sort of ridge, like a cock's comb (only hard), on the top of its head, little pink eyes, and a mouth and chin so large and round that its face looked like that of a pigmy hippopotamus. If they had not been in such a tight place, they would have burst into laughter at the sight of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“抓得好。”王子喝彩道，一面马上把黑炭调转身子，回到屋角上。“尤斯塔斯，”他说，“请你拉住黑炭的头。”随后他下了马，三个人都默默注视着普德格伦把抓住的东西拉到亮处。一看原来是个可怜透顶的小精灵，大约只有三英尺高。头顶上有个像鸡冠似的脊（只是硬邦邦的），粉红的小眼睛，嘴和下巴又大又圆，那张脸看上去就像只小河马。如果他们不是处在这么一种困境中，看见这副模样准会捧腹大笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
