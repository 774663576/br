<div class="line_en">Laila was aware of the face over her, all teeth and tobacco and foreboding eyes. She was dimly aware, too, of Mariam, a presence beyond the face, of her fists raining down. Above them was the ceiling, and it was the ceiling Laila was drawn to, the dark markings of mold spreading across it like ink on a dress, the crack in the plaster that was a stolid smile or a frown, depending on which end of the room you looked at it from. Laila thought of all the times she had tied a rag around the end of a broom and cleaned cobwebs from this ceiling. The three times she and Mariam had put coats of white paint on it. The crack wasn't a smile any longer now but a mocking leer. And it was receding. The ceiling was shrinking, lifting, rising away from her and toward some hazy dimness beyond. It rose until it shrank to the size of a postage stamp, white and bright, everything around it blotted out by the shuttered darkness. In the dark, Rasheed's face was like a sunspot.</div>

<div class="line_en">Brief little bursts of blinding light before her eyes now, like silver stars exploding. Bizarre geometric forms in the light, worms, egg-shaped things, moving up and down, sideways, melting into each other, breaking apart, morphing into something else, then fading, giving way to blackness.</div>

Mariam's face looked thin and drawn in this light, but she did not appear agitated or frightened, merely preoccupied, thoughtful, so self-possessed that when a fly landed on her chin she paid it no attention. She just sat there with her bottom lip stuck out, the way she did when she was absorbed in thought.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="屋外，光线渐渐消逝，天色暗了下来。在这黄昏的光芒中，玛丽雅姆的脸庞显得又瘦又长，但她并没有流露出激动或惊惶，她只是神情专注，心事重重，浑然忘我，连下巴停了一只苍蝇也丝毫没有反应。她只是咬着上唇，坐在那儿；她沉思的时候总是这副样子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">MARIAM FISHED THE bedroom key from Rasheed's pocket before they wrapped him in a bedsheet. Laila took him by the legs, behind the knees, and Mariam grabbed him under the arms. They tried lifting him, but he was too heavy, and they ended up dragging him. As they were passing through the front door and into the yard, Rasheed's foot caught against the doorframe and his leg bent sideways. They had to back up and try again, and then something thumped upstairs and Laila's legs gave out. She dropped Rasheed. She slumped to the ground, sobbing and shaking, and Mariam had to stand over her, hands on hips, and say that she had to get herself together. That what was done was done.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽雅姆从拉希德的口袋掏出房间的钥匙，然后她们用床单把他裹起来。莱拉把手伸到他的膝盖后面，抱着他的双脚，玛丽雅姆则抓住他的腋下。她们试图把他抬起来，可是他太重了，结果她们只好把他拖走。她们拖着他穿过前门，走进院子，拉希德的双脚被门框卡住了，他的腿弯向一旁。她们只得走回去，再次试着把他拖起来；然后楼上传来一声巨响，莱拉双腿发软。她倒在拉希德身边。她趴在地上，啜泣着，浑身颤抖。玛丽雅姆只好站在她身边，双手叉腰，说她必须坚强一点。说事情既然做了就做了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"We have to leave! We can't stay here," Laila said in a broken, husky voice. She thought suddenly of the sound the shovel must have made striking Rasheed's head, and her body pitched forward. Bile surged up her chest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们必须离开！我们不能留在这里！”莱拉心碎地说，她的嗓音很嘶哑。她突然想到铁锹打中拉希德的脑袋肯定发出很响的声音。她的身体向前倾斜，胆汁涌了上来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After a time, Laila got up and wiped her face, and they carried Rasheed to the yard without further incident. They took him into the toolshed. They left him behind the workbench, on which sat his saw, some nails, a chisel, a hammer, and a cylindrical block of wood that Rasheed had been meaning to carve into something for Zalmai but had never gotten around to doing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过了一会，莱拉站起来，擦掉脸上的眼泪，和玛丽雅姆一起，顺顺当当地把拉希德拖到院子里。她们把他拖进工具棚屋。她们把他藏在工作台之后，工作台上摆着一把锯子、几枚铁钉、一把凿子、一把铁锤，还有一块圆柱体形状的木头。拉希德本来打算为察尔迈伊把这块木头雕刻成某种东西，但他一直没有完工。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mariam waited patiently until Laila felt better. Then she had Laila lie down, and, as she stroked Laila's hair in her lap, Mariam said not to worry, that everything would be fine. She said that they would leave -- she, Laila, the children, and Tariq too. They would leave this house, and this unforgiving city. They would leave this despondent country altogether, Mariam said, running her hands through Laila's hair, and go someplace remote and safe where no one would find them, where they could disown their past and find shelter.</div>

<div class="line_en">Laila murmured encouragingly. It would be an existence rife with difficulties, she saw, but of a pleasurable kind, difficulties they could take pride in, possess, value, as one would a family heirloom. Mariam's soft maternal voice went on, brought a degree of comfort to her. There is a way, she'd said, and, in the morning, Mariam would tell her what needed to be done and they would do it, and maybe by tomorrow this time they would be on their way to this new life, a life luxuriant with possibility and joy and welcomed difficulties. Laila was grateful that Mariam was in charge, unclouded and sober, able to think this through for both of them. Her own mind was a jittery, muddled mess.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱拉满怀希望地喃喃自语。她知道未来的生活将会充满困难，但这些是令人愉快的困难，她们将会解决这些困难，将会像对待传家宝一样珍重这些困难，将会从中获得她们的尊严。玛丽雅姆慈祥的柔和声音再次响起，宽慰着莱拉。肯定有办法的，她将会说，等到第二天早晨，玛丽雅姆将会跟莱拉说她们需要做些什么事，她们将会完成它；也许到了明天这个时候，她们已经踏上了一条通往新生活的道路，她们将会知难而上，去拥抱充满各种可能性和欢乐的生活。莱拉感激玛丽雅姆清楚而镇定地，为了她们两个人的将来而安排了这一切。她自己则心绪不宁，头脑一团糟。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They would live in a small house on the edge of some town they'd never heard of, Mariam said, or in a remote village where the road was narrow and unpaved but lined with all manner of plants and shrubs. Maybe there would be a path to take, a path that led to a grass field where the children could play, or maybe a graveled road that would take them to a clear blue lake where trout swam and reeds poked through the surface. They would raise sheep and chickens, and they would make bread together and teach the children to read. They would make new lives for themselves -- peaceful, solitary lives -- and there the weight of all that they'd endured would lift from them, and they would be deserving of all the happiness and simple prosperity they would find.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她们将会去一个未曾听说过的地方，住进一座小小的房子，玛丽雅姆说，或者生活在一个遥远的村庄，那儿的道路很狭窄，而且没有铺路面，但是路两旁有各种各样的树木和草丛。也许那儿还有一条小径，一条通向草地的小径，孩子们可以在草地上玩耍；又或许那儿有一条铺了沙砾的道路，她们可以沿着那条路，来到一个澄蓝的湖泊，鲑鱼在湖里游泳，湖面上生长着芦苇。她们将会喂养绵羊和小鸡，她们将会一起做面包，教两个孩子读书识字。她们将会过上新的生活——安宁的、孤独的生活，卸下长久以来所承受的重负，过上幸福的小康生活。">查看中文翻译</div>
