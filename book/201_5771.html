<div class="line_en">All lessons were suspended, all examinations postponed. Some students were hurried away from Hogwarts by their parents over the next couple of days -- the Patil twins were gone before breakfast on the morning following Dumbledore's death and Zacharias Smith was escorted from the castle by his haughty-looking father. Seamus Finnigan, on the other hand, refused point-blank to accompany his mother home; they had a shouting match in the Entrance Hall which was resolved when she agreed that he could remain behind for the funeral. She had difficulty in finding a bed in Hogsmeade, Seamus told Harry and Ron, for wizards and witches were pouring into the village, preparing to pay their last respects to Durnbledore.</div>

<div class="line_en">Some excitement was caused among the younger students, who had never seen it before, when a powder-blue carriage the size of a house, pulled by a dozen giant winged palominos, came soaring out of the sky in the late afternoon before the funeral and landed on the edge of the Forest. Harry watched from a window as a gigantic and handsome olive-skinned, black-haired woman descended the carriage steps and threw herself into the waiting Hagrid's arms. Meanwhile a delegation of Ministry officials, including the Minister for Magic himself, was being accommodated within the castle. Harry was diligently avoiding contact with any of them; he was sure that, sooner or later, he would be asked again to account for Dumbledore's last excursion from Hogwarts.</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny were spending all of their time together. The beautiful weather seemed to mock them; Harry could imagine how it would have been if Durnbledore had not died, and they had had this time together at the very end of the year, Ginny's examinations finished, the pressure of homework lifted… and hour by hour, he put off saying the thing that he knew he must say, doing what he knew it was right to do, because it was too hard to forgo his best source of comfort.</div>

There might still be as many as four Horcruxes out there somewhere and each would need to be found and eliminated before there was even a possibility that Voldemort could be killed. He kept reciting their names to himself, as though by listing them he could bring them within reach: "the locket…, the cup… the snake… something of Gryffindor's or Ravenclaw's… the locket… the cup… the snake… something of Gryffindor's or Ravenclaw's…"</div>

<div class="line_en">Silence fell between them, each of them lost in their own thoughts, but Harry was sure that they, like him, were thinking about the following morning, when Dumbledore's body would be laid to rest. Harry had never attended a funeral before; there had been no body to bury when Sirius had died. He did not know what to expect and was a little worried about what he might see, about how he would feel. He wondered whether Dumbledore's death would be more real to him once the funeral was over. Though he had moments when the horrible fact of it threatened to overwhelm him, there were blank stretches of numbness where, despite the fact that nobody was talking about anything else in the whole castle, he still found it difficult 10 believe that Dumbledore had really gone. Admittedly he had not, as he had with Sirius, looked desperately for some kind of loophole, some way that Dumbledore would come back… he felt in his pocket for the cold chain of the fake Horcrux, which he now carried with him everywhere, not as a talisman, but as a reminder of what it had cost and what remained still to do.</div>

<div class="line_en">Over at the Slytherin table Crabbe and Goyle were muttering together. Hulking boys though they were, they looked oddly lonely without the tall, pale figure of Malfoy between them, bossing them around. Harry had not spared Malfoy much thought. His animosity was all for Snape, but he had not forgotten the fear in Malfoy's voice on that Tower top, nor the fact that he had lowered his wand before the other Death Eaters arrived. Harry did not believe that Malfoy would have killed Dumbledore. He despised Malfoy still for his infatuation with the Dark Arts, but now the tiniest drop of pity mingled with his dislike. Where, Harry wondered, was Malfoy now, and what was Voldemort making him do under threat of killing him and his parents?</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry rose early to pack the next day; the Hogwarts Express would be leaving an hour after the funeral. Down-stairs he found the mood in the Great Hall subdued. Every-body was wearing their dress robes and no one seemed very hungry. Professor McGonagall had left the thronelike chair in the middle of the staff table empty. Hagrid's chair was deserted too: Harry thought thai perhaps he had not been able to face breakfast; but Snape's place had been unceremoniously filled by Rufus Scrimgeour. Harry avoided his yellowish eyes as they scanned the Hall; Harry had the uncomfortable feeling that Scrimgeour was looking for him.

<div class="line_en">An extraordinary assortment of people had already settled into half of the chairs: shabby and smart, old and young. Most Harry did not recognise, but there were a few that he did, including members of the Order of the Phoenix: Kingsley Shacklebolt, Mad-Eye Moody, Tonks, her hair miraculously returned to vividest pink, Remus Lupin, with whom she seemed to be holding hands, Mr and Mrs Weasley, Bill sup-ported by Fleur and followed by Fred and George, who were wearing jackets of black dragonskin. Then there was Madame Maxime, who took up two-and-a-half chairs on her own, Tom, the landlord of the Leaky Cauldron, Arabella Figg, Harry's Squib neighbour, the hairy bass player from the wizardmg group the Weird bisters, hrnie Frang, dnver ol the Knight Bus, Madam Malkin, of the robe shop in Diagon Alley, and some people whom Harry merely knew by sight, such as the barman of the Hog's Head and the witch who pushed the trolley on the Hogwarts Express.

<div class="line_en">Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny filed into seats at the end of a row beside the lake. People were whispering to each other; it sounded like a breeze in the grass, but the birdsong was louder by far. The crowd continued to swell; with a great rush of affection for both of them, Harry saw Neville being helped into a seat by Luna. They alone of all the DA had responded to Hermione's summons the night that Dumbledore had died, and Harry knew why: they were the ones who had missed the DA most… probably the ones who had checked their coins regularly in the hope that there would be another meeting…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利、罗恩、赫敏和金妮依次坐到湖边那排椅子的最后几个座位上。人们在小声地互相交谈，声音像是微风吹过草地，而鸟叫的声音显得格外响亮。人群还在不断拥来。哈利看见卢娜扶着纳威在椅子上坐下，不由得对他们俩产生了喜爱之情。在邓布利多去世的那天夜里，D.A。的所有成员中只有他们俩响应了赫敏的召唤，哈利知道这是为什么：他们俩最怀念D.A。……也许他们经常会把硬币拿出来看看，希望D.A。还会再组织活动……">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Cornelius Fudge walked past them towards the front rows, his expression miserable, twirling his green bowler hat as usual; Harry next recognised Rita Skeeter, who, he was infuriated to see, had a notebook clutched in her red-takmed hand; and then, with a worse jolt of fury, Dolores Umbridge, an unconvincing expression of grief upon her toadlike face, a black velvet bow set atop her iron-coloured curls. At the sight of the centaur Firenze, who was standing like a sentinel near the water's edge, she gave a start and scurried hastily into a seat a good distance away.</div>

<div class="line_en">And he saw them in the clear green sunlit water, inches below the surface, reminding him horribly of the Inferi; a chorus of merpeople singing in a strange language he did not understand, their pallid faces rippling, their purplish hair flowing all around them. The music made the hair on Harry's neck stand up and yet it was not unpleasant. It spoke very clearly of loss and of despair. As he looked down into the wild faces of the singers he had the feeling that they, at least, were sorry for Dumbledore's passing. Then Ginny nudged him again and he looked round.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，他看见了他们，就在阳光照耀下的清澈的绿色湖水中，就在湖面下几英寸的地方，这使他想起了那些阴尸，恐惧再次袭上心头。一支人鱼组成的合唱队用一种奇怪的、他听不懂的语言在婉转歌唱，他们苍白的面孔荡漾不定，紫色的头发在他们周围漂浮。这音乐听得哈利脖子后面的汗毛根根竖立，却并不刺耳难听。它明明白白地诉说着哀痛和绝望。哈利低头望着水里那些情绪激动的面孔，觉得至少他们是在为邓布利多的离去感到忧伤。这时，金妮又捅了捅他，他转过脸来。">查看中文翻译</div>

He was crying quite silently, his face gleaming with tears, and in his arms, wrapped in purple velvet spangled with golden stars, was what Harry knew to be Dumbledore's body. A sharp pain rose in Harry's throat at this sight: for a moment, the strange music and the knowledge that Dumbledore's body was so close seemed to take all warmth from the day. Ron looked white and shocked. Tears were falling thick and fast into both Ginny and Hermione's laps.</div>

<div class="line_en">A little tufty-haired man in plain black robes had got to his feet and stood now in front of Dumbledore's body. Harry could not hear what he was saying. Odd words floated back to them over the hundreds of beads. "Nobility of spirit"…"intellectual contribution"…"greatness of heart"… it did not mean very much. It had little to do with Dumbledore as Harry had known him. He suddenly remembered Dumbledore's idea of a few words: "nitwit", "oddment", "blubber" and "tweak", and again, had to suppress a grin… what was the matter with him?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个头发浓密、穿一身朴素黑袍子的小个子男人从座位上站起身，站在邓布利多的遗体前。哈利听不清他在说些什么。偶尔有只言片语越过几百个脑袋飘到后面。“高贵的精神”……“学术成熟”……“伟大的心灵”……这些都没有多大意义。这些都跟哈利认识的那个邓布利多没有多大关系。他突然想起邓布利多发明的那几个词：“笨蛋！”“哭鼻子！”“残渣”和“拧”，又一次忍不住想笑……他这是怎么了？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They could not see clearly what was happening at the front. Hagrid seemed to have placed the body carefully upon the table. Now he retreated down the aisle, blowing his nose with loud trumpeting noises that drew scandalised looks from some, including, Harry saw, Dolores Umbridge… but Harry knew that Dumbledore would not have cared. He tried to make a friendly gesture to Hagrid as he passed, but Hagrid's eyes were so swollen it was a wonder he could see where he was going. Harry glanced at the back row to which Hagrid was heading and realised what was guiding him, for there, dressed in a jacket and trousers each the size of a small marquee, was the giant Grawp, his great ugly boulder-like head bowed, docile, almost human. Hagrid sat down next to his half-brother and Grawp palled Hagrid hard on the head, so that his chair legs sank into the ground. Harry had a wonderful momentary urge to laugh. But then the music stopped and he turned to face the front again.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a soft splashing noise to his left and he saw that the merpeople had broken the surface to listen, too. He remembered Dumbledore crouching at the water's edge two years ago, very close to where Harry now sat, and conversing in Mermish with the Merchieftainess. Harry wondered where Dumbledore had learned Mermish. There was so much he had never asked him, so much he should have said…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="左边传来了水花泼溅的声音，他扭头一看，那些人鱼都冒出了水面，也在仔细地倾听。哈利想起两年前邓布利多蹲在水边，差不多就在此刻哈利所坐的这个位置，用人鱼的语言跟人鱼的首领交谈。哈利不知道邓布利多是在哪儿学会了人鱼的语言。他有那么多事情没有问他，他有那么多话应该对他讲……">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And then, without warning, it swept over him, the dreadful truth, more completely and undeniably than it had until now. Dumbledore was dead, gone… he clutched the cold locket in his hand so tightly that it hurt, but he could not prevent hot tears spilling from his eyes: he looked away from Ginny and the others and stared out over the lake, towards the Forest, as the little man in black droned on… there was movement among the trees. The centaurs had come to pay their respects, too. They did not move into the open but Harry saw them standing quite still, half-hidden in shadow, watching the wizards, their bows hanging at their sides. And Harry remembered his first nightmarish trip into the Forest, the first time he had ever encountered the thing that was then Voldemort, and how he had faced him, and how he and Dumbledore had discussed fighting a losing battle not long thereafter. It was important, Dumbledore said, to fight, and fight again, and keep fighting, for only then could evil be kept at bay, though never quite eradicated…</div>

White smoke spiralled into the air and made strange shapes: Harry thought, for one heart-stopping moment, that he saw a phoenix fly joyfully into the blue, but next second the fire had vanished. In its place was a white marble tomb, encasing Dumbledore's body and the table on which he had rested.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然，几个人尖叫起来。耀眼的白色火焰从邓布利多的遗体和那张桌子周围蹿了出来：火苗越蹿越高，遮挡住了遗体。白色的烟袅袅地升向空中，呈现出各种奇怪的形状：一刹那间，哈利仿佛看见一只凤凰欢快地飞上了蓝天，但紧接着火焰就消失了，那里出现了一座白色的大理石坟墓，把邓布利多的遗体和安放遗体的那张桌子都包在了里面。">查看中文翻译</div>

He could not let anybody else stand between him and Voldemort; he must abandon for ever the illusion he ought to have lost at the age of one: that the shelter of a parent's arms meant that nothing could hurt him. There was no waking from his nightmare, no comforting whisper in the dark that he was safe really, that it was all in his imagination; the last and greatest of his proteclors had died and he was more alone than he had ever been before.</div>

She met Harry's gaze with the same hard, blazing look that he had seen when she had hugged him after winning the Quidditch Cup in his absence, and he knew that at that moment they understood each other perfectly, and that when he told her what he was going to do now, she would not say "Be careful", or "Don't do it", but accept his decision, because she would not have expected anything less of him.

<div class="line_cn" title="听着这些话，哈利再也忍受不住了，他想，如果他继续坐在金妮身边，他的决心肯定会动摇。他看见罗恩此刻把赫敏搂在怀里，轻轻地抚摸着她的头发，赫敏趴在他的肩头伤心地哭泣，大滴的眼泪也从罗恩的长鼻子尖上滚落下来。哈利狼狈地站起身，背对着金妮和邓布利多的坟墓，绕着湖边走去。走动一下比静静坐着好受多了：正如尽早动身去寻找魂器，消灭伏地魔，会比焦虑地等待好受得多……">查看中文翻译</div>

That's what he wanted me to do, that's why he told me all about them. If Dumbledore was right -- and I'm sure he was -- there are still four of them out there. I've got to find them and destroy them and then I've got to go after the seventh bit of Voldemort's soul, the bit that's still in his body, and I'm the one who's going to kill him.
