<div class="line_en">They hanged at Tyburn, in those days, so the street outside Newgate had not obtained one infamous notoriety that has since attached to it. But, the gaol was a vile place, in which most kinds of debauchery and villainy were practised, and where dire diseases were bred, that came into court with the prisoners, and sometimes rushed straight from the dock at my Lord Chief Justice himself, and pulled him off the bench. It had more than once happened, that the Judge in the black cap pronounced his own doom as certainly as the prisoner's, and even died before him. For the rest, the Old Bailey was famous as a kind of deadly inn-yard, from which pale travellers set out continually, in carts and coaches, on a violent passage into the other world: traversing some two miles and a half of public street and road, and shaming few good citizens, if any. So powerful is use, and so desirable to be good use in the beginning. It was famous, too, for the pillory, a wise old institution, that inflicted a punishment of which no one could foresee the extent; also, for the whipping-post, another dear old institution, very humanising and softening to behold in action; also, for extensive transactions in blood-money, another fragment of ancestral wisdom, systematically leading to the most frightful mercenary crimes that could be committed under Heaven. Altogether, the Old Bailey, at that date, was a choice illustration of the precept, that "Whatever is is right;" an aphorism that would be as final as it is lazy, did it not include the troublesome consequence, that nothing that ever was, was wrong.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那时绞刑还在泰本执行，因此新门监狱大门外那条街还不像后来那么声名狼籍，但监狱却是个恶劣的地方，各种堕落荒唐与流氓行为都在那里出现，各种可怕的疾病也都在那里孳生，而且随着囚徒进入法庭，有时甚至从被告席径直传染给大法官，把他从宝座上拉下来。戴黑色礼帽的法官对囚犯宣判死刑时，也宣判了自己的毁灭，甚至毁灭得比囚犯还早的事出现过不止一次。此外，老贝勒还以“死亡逆旅”闻名。面无人色的旅客不断从那儿出发，坐着大车或马车经过一条充满暴烈事件的路去到另一个世界。在穿过大约两英里半的大街和公路时，并没有几个公民（即使有的话）为此感到惭傀。习惯是强有力的，习惯成自然在开始时也很有用处。这监狱还以枷刑闻名。那是一种古老而聪明的制度，那种惩罚伤害之深没有人可以预见。它也以鞭刑柱闻名，那也是一种可爱而古老的制度，看了之后是会令人大发慈悲，心肠变软的。它也以大量的“血钱”交易闻名，那也是我们祖宗聪明的一种表现，它能系统全面地引向天下最骇人听闻的雇佣犯罪。总而言之，那时的老贝勒是“存在便是合理”这句名言的最佳例证。这个警句若是没有包含“过去不存在的也都不合理”这个令人尴尬的推论的话，倒可以算作是结论性的，虽然并不管用。">查看中文翻译</div>

For, people then paid to see the play at the Old Bailey, just as they paid to see the play in Bedlam -- only the former entertainment was much the dearer. Therefore, all the Old Bailey doors were well guarded -- except, indeed, the social doors by which the criminals got there, and those were always left wide open.</div>

Mr. Lorry sat at a table, among the gentlemen in wigs: not far from a wigged gentleman, the prisoner's counsel, who had a great bundle of papers before him: and nearly opposite another wigged gentleman with his hands in his pockets, whose whole attention, when Mr. Cruncher looked at him then or afterwards, seemed to be concentrated on the ceiling of the court.

<div class="line_en">Everybody present, except the one wigged gentleman who looked at the ceiling, stared at him. All the human breath in the place, rolled at him, like a sea, or a wind, or a fire. Eager faces strained round pillars and corners, to get a sight of him; spectators in back rows stood up, not to miss a hair of him; people on the floor of the court, laid their hands on the shoulders of the people before them, to help themselves, at anybody's cost, to a view of him -- stood a-tiptoe, got upon ledges, stood upon next to nothing, to see every inch of him. Conspicuous among these latter, like an animated bit of the spiked wall of Newgate, Jerry stood: aiming at the prisoner the beery breath of a whet he had taken as he came along, and discharging it to mingle with the waves of other beer, and gin, and tea, and coffee, and what not, that flowed at him, and already broke upon the great windows behind him in an impure mist and rain.</div>

<div class="line_en">The object of all this staring and blaring, was a young man of about five-and-twenty, well-grown and well-looking, with a sunburnt cheek and a dark eye. His condition was that of a young gentleman. He was plainly dressed in black, or very dark grey, and his hair, which was long and dark, was gathered in a ribbon at the back of his neck; more to be out of his way than for ornament. As an emotion of the mind will express itself through any covering of the body, so the paleness which his situation engendered came through the brown upon his cheek, showing the soul to be stronger than the sun. He was otherwise quite self-possessed, bowed to the Judge, and stood quiet.</div>

The form that was to be doomed to be so shamefully mangled, was the sight; the immortal creature that was to be so butchered and torn asunder, yielded the sensation.

Haunted in a most ghastly manner that abominable place would have been, if the glass could ever have rendered back its reflections, as the ocean is one day to give up its dead. Some passing thought of the infamy and disgrace for which it had been reserved, may have struck the prisoner's mind. Be that as it may, a change in his position making him conscious of a bar of light across his face, he looked up; and when he saw the glass his face flushed, and his right hand pushed the herbs away.</div>

<div class="line_en">It happened, that the action turned his face to that side of the court which was on his left. About on a level with his eyes, there sat, in that corner of the Judge's bench, two persons upon whom his look immediately rested; so immediately, and so much to the changing of his aspect, that all the eyes that were turned upon him, turned to them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="原来这个动作使他把头转向了他左边的法庭。在法官座位的角落上坐着两个人，位置大体跟他的目光齐平。他的目光立即落到两人身上。那目光闪落之快，他的脸色变化之大，使得转向他的目光全都又转向了那两个人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His daughter had one of her hands drawn through his arm, as she sat by him, and the other pressed upon it. She had drawn close to him, in her dread of the scene, and in her pity for the prisoner. Her forehead had been strikingly expressive of an engrossing terror and compassion that saw nothing but the peril of the accused. This had been so very noticeable, so very powerfully and naturally shown, that starers who had had no pity for him were touched by her; and the whisper went about, "Who are they?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的女儿坐在他身边，一只手挽着他的胳膊，另一只手搭在胳膊上面。她因害怕这场面，也因怜悯那囚徒，身子挪得更靠近他了。因为只看到被告的危险，她的额头鲜明地表现出了专注的恐怖与同情。这种表情太引人注目，太强有力，流露得太自然，那些对囚犯全无同情的看客也不禁受到感染。一片窃窃私语随之而起，“这两人是谁呀？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The spectators saw in the two figures, a young lady of little more than twenty, and a gentleman who was evidently her father; a man of a very remarkable appearance in respect of the absolute whiteness of his hair, and a certain indescribable intensity of face: not of an active kind, but pondering and self-communing. When this expression was upon him, he looked as if he were old; but when it was stirred and broken up -- as it was now, in a moment, on his speaking to his daughter -- he became a handsome man, not past the prime of life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="观众看到的两个人一个是刚过二十的小姐，另一个显然是她的父亲。后者以他满头的白发十分引人注目。他脸上带着一种难以描述的紧张表情：并非活跃性的紧张，而是沉思的内心自省的紧张。这种表情在他脸上时，他便显得憔悴苍老，可是那表情一消失——现在它就暂时消失了，因为他跟女儿说话——他又变成了一个漂亮的男人，还没有超过他的最佳年华。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jerry, the messenger, who had made his own observations, in his own manner, and who had been sucking the rust off his fingers in his absorption, stretched his neck to hear who they were. The crowd about him had pressed and passed the inquiry on to the nearest attendant, and from him it had been more slowly pressed and passed back; at last it got to Jerry:</div>
