<div class="line_en">I don't think it ever occurred to me that enrolling as the first and only Western student in a Chinese chef's school was a difficult or a strange thing to do. It was an impulsive decision, like going to China in the first place. I wanted to learn more about Sichuanese food, and I didn't even consider as an obstacle the fact that I would have to study in Sichuanese dialect, in a big rowdy class of boys who weren't necessarily going to accept me.</div>

<div class="line_en">Of course I had been used to sharing my family home in Oxford with foreigners, and to negotiating cultural difference on a daily basis. It had been no surprise to come down to breakfast and find a Sicilian engineer or a Turkish porcelain tycoon drinking coffee with my parents. Family camping holidays around the British Isles or Europe were never very organised. My father plotted our routes, choosing roads on the basis that they appeared as wiggly lines on the map and were therefore likely to be scenic. We rarely had a firm idea about where we would stay, and often had to pitch camp spontaneously by the side of the road.</div>

<div class="line_en">The same applied to living in China in general. The country was still in the stranglehold of the decaying communist system. Stuffy bureaucrats made key decisions in every state-run institution and state-owned restaurant. If you obeyed the rules and tried to make arrangements through official channels, whether they were for a cooking lesson or a trip to a forbidden part of the country, you would be thwarted at every turn. Everything would be impossible: the system, it seemed, was designed to say 'no'. Yet in other ways, China was positively anarchic: anything was possible. You just had to improvise.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不仅是旅行，在中国的生活大体上也是这样子。这个国家还被逐渐僵化的计划经济体系把控着。国有机构和国营餐馆中，都是人员冗余的官僚集团说了算。中国在外国的背包客圈儿里是个传奇，一路上遇到的服务人员全都摆着臭脸、态度粗暴，而且无论问什么问题，他们总是令人沮丧地丢出永恒的答案：“没有。”要是你遵守各种条条框框，通过官方渠道办事，不管是报名烹饪课还是去中国的某个“禁地”旅行，那几乎每走一步都会遭遇挫败。一切都是不可能的，仿佛整个体制的设定就是对任何要求说“不”。然而，要是走别的渠道，中国又仿佛是个“无政府主义”的地方。这里的“无政府主义”是个褒义词：一切皆有可能，你只是需要一点临场发挥。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In China, my travelling was similarly open-ended. I would just have the thought of going to a particular place, and then go there, without paying any attention to logistics. This was probably the only way to deal with China in the mid-nineties, because if you did stop for a moment to consider the horrifically dangerous roads, the joltingly uncomfortable buses, the hassle from the police and the long hours it took to get anywhere, you would be unlikely to venture out at all.</div>

<div class="line_en">I spent most of my holidays in China travelling into fei kai fang di qu ('areas that are not open'). I had to use subterfuge to buy bus tickets, to travel before dawn, and to disguise myself, on several occasions, as a Chinese peasant. Upon arrival in a forbidden area, it became a matter of persuading minor officials and policemen to do things that were against their better judgement. Mostly, they were flummoxed at being faced with a friendly twenty-something Englishwoman chatting merrily to them in Chinese. They would offer me tea and cigarettes, listen to my charm offensive, and eventually agree to waive the fine, let me stay for a little longer, or allow me to take photographs of the local monastery. I was always aided in my outrageous negotiations by the fact that communications in remote areas were lousy: the doubtful policeman would invariably try to telephone his superiors in the nearest town for advice on how to handle the crisis, but the lines were always down. It was just him versus me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="年轻而富有冒险精神的我，在中国的大多数假期都是在“非开放地区”旅行。那些地区有这个国家最美、最原始的处女地。我必须用各种托词和借口买车票，天不亮就出发赶路，在好些情况下还需要乔装打扮成中国农民。一到某个“禁地”，就要对着某些小官和警察好说歹说，让他们行些不愿意行的方便。大多数时候，看着面前这个二十多岁、笑容友好的英国姑娘用中文跟他们愉快地交流，他们脸上都是一副困惑的表情。他们请我喝茶、给我递烟、看着我发动“魅力攻势”，最终同意不罚款，让我多待几天，或者同意我拍当地佛寺的照片。偏远地区的通讯条件总是很差，这对我那些离谱的“谈判”很有利。警察不知道该怎么办的时候，一定会想给附近城镇的上级打电话，想问问如何处理眼前的“危机”。但线路一般都不通，于是就剩下我和他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In my twenties I relished the challenge of this cloak-and-dagger travel. It was fantastically exciting for a start, wandering off into Tibetan counties that had barely seen any foreigners since the early twentieth-century missionaries. Strange though it may sound, I also adored the sport of my skirmishes with the Chinese police. I was not a Tibetan, who might be sent to a prison camp on trumped-up political charges, or a peasant at the mercy of the vagaries of some local official. I knew enough about Chinese political sensitivities to avoid doing anything stupid. So there was nothing at stake: the worst that might happen was that I might be fined and packed off back to Chengdu.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="二十多岁的我相当享受这“十面埋伏”的旅行带来的挑战。旅行的本身就特别棒、特别令人兴奋。我在西藏的城镇里到处漫步：自二十世纪初的外国传教士之后，这些地方就没怎么来过外国人。我感觉自己太荣幸、太奢侈了，能够在商业旅游汹汹而来之前体验这些非凡离奇的化外之地。听起来可能很奇怪，我觉得和中国的“有关部门”起点小冲突、小争执也挺好玩的。我算是了解中国的政治敏感点，不会做什么真正的傻事。我不过就是想找找乐子、享受旅行而已，而且也没什么大危险：最糟糕的情况不过就是被罚个款，然后收拾收拾回成都。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Liu Yaochun and I first met when we were fixed up together as conversation partners by the history faculty at Sichuan University. Most of my foreign student friends were introduced by their teachers to dull language partners, with whom they had a few strained conversations about cultural differences before deciding to abandon the experiment. But Liu Yaochun was different. The elder son of two illiterate peasants from one of China's poorest regions, he had managed to win a place at Sichuan University by sheer brainpower. By the time I met him, he was already embarking on the postgraduate history degree that would lead him into a career in academia. (To me, he always seemed like a human advertisement for the social mobility created by Chinese communism.) He turned out to be fantastic company: original, funny, and full of ideas. We spent many hours talking to each other in a wild mix of English and Chinese, about history, culture, politics, philosophy, morality and religion. It is to him that I owe most of my Chinese language skills, and he says the same about me with reference to his English.</div>

<div class="line_en">So I became brazen in my attitude to China. I just went ahead and asked, fully expecting everything to fall into place as I wished, somehow ('La Principessa', my Italian friend Francesca called me).

<div class="line_en">Studying at the Sichuan cooking school, battling against the chauvanism of my classmates and struggling with the language of professional Chinese cookery, was just another of the bizarre adventures I was encountering so often that they had come to seem an entirely normal part of life. By then it didn't require any particular courage or determination. I just got on with it. Far more difficult, in a way, was the time I spent with my friend Liu Yaochun and his family, passing the Chinese New Year in their remote village in the north of China.</div>

<div class="line_en">My first visit to the village where Liu Yaochun had grown up was a culture shock, despite my growing familiarity with China. I had leapt at the invitation to spend the Lunar New Year with his family, and made my way there on a series of trains and long-distance buses. The village lay in a distant corner of northwestern Gansu Province, not far from Inner Mongolia and the northern fringes of the Chinese empire. It was midwinter, and freezing cold. The white, wintry sun hung over a bleached landscape, eerily bland, devoid of feature and colour. Monotonous, pale, dusty hills rose to the north; the pale dusty fields were bare; and the houses were built out of the same pale earth as the land on which they stood. Even the poplar trees, leafless in winter, were covered in dust, and the sky was so feeble a blue that it looked scarcely different from the land. It made me feel desolate, this monochrome emptiness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第一次来到刘复兴土生土长的乡村，对中国自以为已经非常熟悉的我还是受到了强烈的文化冲击。他邀请我跟他们一家人过春节的时候，我高兴得跳起来，换了好几趟火车、汽车，风雨无阻地到了目的地。这个乡村在中国西北部甘肃省一个偏远的角落，就在内蒙古附近，也是古中华帝国的国境之北。正值隆冬，这里简直是个冰窟窿。冬天白晃晃的冷太阳照在白晃晃的土地上，有种怪诞的冷清，说不出什么特点，没有别的色彩。北边绵延着单调、苍白、尘土飞扬的山丘；荒凉光秃的田野上也弥漫着沙尘；地上的土是苍白的，房子也是用同样苍白的土修起来的；就连冬天掉光了叶子的杨树，也覆盖着一层尘土。天空蓝得有气无力，看着也跟大地没什么区别。这黑白色调的空旷与单调，让我顿生无限的孤寂之感。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Liu Yaochun was a Cultural Revolution baby, born in 1970. When he was small, he lived with his parents, and, later, his brother and sister, in a single-roomed village house built of mud bricks, with an earthen floor. The land his parents farmed was dry and dusty, the northern winters harsh. His primary school was another mud hut, and there was little to eat most of the time besides dried sweet-potato chips that were sent as famine relief by the authorities. But Liu Yaochun was clever and hard-working, and he swotted away in his mud hut, learning his Chinese characters and doing his sums. His parents, knowing that a good education was his only chance to escape a life of peasant drudgery, sent him to high school in the nearby county town, where he lodged with an aunt and uncle. Six years later, at the age of eighteen, he passed the national university examinations and matriculated at Sichuan University, one of the best in China.</div>

<div class="line_en">Although his parents were still in their forties, they looked older, worn out by a life of gruelling agricultural labour. They had lived through the tumult of land reform, famine and the Cultural Revolution. (Liu Yaochun's father, with an embarrassed grin, recalled his fatuous political activities during those years -- like dancing the 'loyalty dance' to Chairman Mao, which involved skipping around the outline of the Chinese character for 'loyalty' on the ground.) Because they couldn't read, and spoke a thick local dialect, travelling was difficult for them. The furthest they had been from the village was to the provincial capital, Lanzhou -- and even that was adventurous by the standards of most of their neighbours.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的父母都是四十多岁，但看着显老，一辈子辛辛苦苦做农活让他们饱经风霜。他们经历了土改、饥荒和“文革”等一系列变故（刘复兴的爸爸憨厚又难为情地笑着，回忆了那些年自己跳“忠字舞”向毛主席表忠心：要用舞姿在地上写个“忠”字）。他们不认字，说话也带着浓重的方言口音，所以很难去外面走走看看。他们离开村子去得最远的地方就是省城兰州。就连这在他们的很多邻居眼里也是了不起的冒险了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Liu Yaochun's parents no longer lived in a mud hut, but they were still illiterate. Some years before, they had built themselves a traditional home from pine and poplar trunks, bricks and earth: five rooms and a grain store opening on to a walled courtyard. Outside the walls, there was a small orchard, and a shed for the ass. The main room was bright and high-ceilinged, with exposed beams. One end of it was taken up by the kang, the raised earthen platform that is the social centre of rural houses in northern China, beneath which smouldered a fire of animal dung, keeping it constantly warm. We sat on the kang during the day, brewing tea on a wood-fired stove whose tin chimney lurched crazily upwards to a hole in the roof; at night I slept there with Liu Yaochun's mother and sister, each of us wrapped in quilts. The men, Liu Yaochun and his father and brother, slept on another kang, in a room across the yard.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="刘复兴的父母已经不住泥棚屋了，但仍然大字不识。几年前，他们用松树和杨树的树干、砖和土，自己盖了当地的传统民房：五间房，一个储粮仓，有围墙的前院。围墙外面有个小果园，外加一个茅房。大房挑高敞亮，木头横梁裸露在外。房间一头是炕：用土砌起来的高台，这是华北农村地区的社交中心，下面一直用动物粪便焖火保温。白天我们就坐在炕上，在柴炉子上煮着茶，铁烟囱以相当疯狂的姿势耸立在房顶的一个洞上；晚上我和刘复兴的妈妈、妹妹一起睡，每个人身上都裹了好几层被子。刘复兴与爸爸和弟弟这几个男人睡在院子对面一间房的另一张炕上。">查看中文翻译</div>

She had several granddaughters too, but, being female, they didn't count in the family hierarchy.

<div class="line_en">With Liu Yaochun at my side, I wandered from house to house, courtyard to courtyard, taking the official family photographs: a young woman and the fiancé chosen by her parents; baby sons with penises proudly displayed through the gaps in open trousers; old people posing solemnly for my portraits, perhaps their last. These photographs, the most serious, would be the ones that would grace the family shrines, to be revered by future generations. The old people preferred to be photographed in black and white, feeling it, perhaps, to be a more ancestral medium.</div>

While the men and I lazed around on the kang, smoking cigarettes and chatting, they swept away the fag ends and the watermelon seed husks we had cast to the floor. In the kitchen, they kneaded flour into dough for steamed buns; they mixed flour with water, rolled it and cut it into noodles, or pulled it into ma hua twists. They chopped wood and stoked the fires in the stove and beneath the kangs. At mealtimes, they waited on us, and ate their own food afterwards, in the kitchen. Then they washed the dishes.

<div class="line_en">The meals we ate were simple and monotonous; this was not the rich gastronomic landscape of Sichuan, but the arid north, and winter too, when there was little to eat besides wheat, pork, chilli and garlic. Rice was an occasional luxury. Sometimes the staple grain on the table was millet, an ancient Chinese cereal that city dwellers regard as lowly peasant food, but even that was unusual. As my Sichuanese university teacher once said to me disparagingly: 'In the north all they eat is mian (flour-foods).' We sat at the square wooden table in the main room, slurping our noodles or chomping on plain buns, adding crushed garlic or chillies in oil to enliven their blandness.

After a few days my bowels had turned to concrete.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们吃的饭都比较简单单调。这里可不是拥有丰富美味的四川，而是荒凉的华北，还是在冬天，除了小麦、猪肉、辣椒和大蒜也没什么别的食材。米饭偶尔能吃上一顿，已是奢侈。有时候饭桌上的主食是小米，比较古老的中国谷物，城里人都觉得是农村人吃的低等粗粮。但那里就连小米也很少见。我记得川大有个老师曾经用很嫌弃的语气跟我说：“北方人只吃面食。”我们坐在大房的方形木桌周围，吸溜吸溜地吃着面或者啃着馒头，不时加点蒜粒或者辣椒油来提提味。早、午、晚饭没什么区别，几乎吃不到什么肉，唯一的新鲜食材是家里自己种的洋葱、芹菜、大蒜和苹果。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">You have only to visit places like Liu Yaochun's village to realise that the concept of a single 'Chinese cuisine' is rather flimsy. For a start, China is divided, north-south, between the wheat-eaters and the rice-eaters. The inhabitants of Gansu belong to the former, their province part of a great swathe of pasta- and bread-eating territory that extends west from the eastern coast and Beijing to the borders of Central Asia, and even further. Certain northern Chinese pasta forms are strikingly similar to those found in Italy: like the 'cats' ears' eaten in Xi'an, which are identical in shape and manufacture to orecchiette. The Italian folk explanation is that Marco Polo introduced the Chinese to spaghetti and its ilk during his travels in the late thirteenth century, while the Chinese like to think that pasta was a gift they gave to the world. In 2005, Chinese archaeologists claimed to have clinched the argument by discovering a four-thousand-year-old bowlful of millet noodles in a site they excavated along the Yellow River. Many experts, however, believe that the true origins of pasta-type foods lie further west, in Persia.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="只有到了刘复兴这个村，你才会意识到把“中国菜”作为单一的概念是多么笼统浅薄。首先，中国南北分化严重：一方吃大米，一方吃小麦；甘肃的居民属于后者。从东海岸和北京往西，一直到中亚的边境甚至更远，这么大的一片区域的主食都是面和馒头，甘肃就是其中之一。华北的有些面食形状和意大利面有着惊人的相似：比如“猫耳朵”，和意大利的耳状通心粉在形状和制作方法上都完全一样。意大利人的解释是，马可·波罗在十九世纪末旅居中国时把意大利面介绍给了当地人；而中国人则觉得面食是他们送给全世界的礼物。二零零五年，中国考古学家宣布，纷争终结，因为他们在黄河沿岸一个考古现场挖掘出四千年前的一碗小米挂面。不过很多专家都认为，这种面片状的食物应该起源于更西部的波斯。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the days leading up to the New Year, I watched Liu Yaochun's family make their preparations for the feast. Liu Yaochun was in charge of the Spring Festival couplets: with a calligraphy brush he inked auspicious phrases on to strips of red paper that would be pasted up around every doorway in the house (sometimes it's useful to have a literate son in the family). The fattened pig had already been slaughtered and brined, but his father took the cockerel outside and dispatched it with a cleaver, letting its blood drain out into the dusty earth. In the main street that ran through the village, local lads practised their drumming, and the children made beautiful lanterns out of wooden struts and multi-coloured paper. The girls were dressed brightly in scarlet, fuchsia pink, or red-and-pink, as if to defy the bleached monotony of the landscape.</div>

<div class="line_en">The elderly are revered in China partly because they are ancestors-in-waiting. After they die, their descendants will (they hope) place their images on the shrine table in the main room of the house, and honour their spirits with offerings. Some of the grander old families in Liu Yaochun's village still possessed ancestral scrolls, family trees illustrated with pictures of the deceased, generation by generation, which traditionally hang over the shrine. Pictures of Mao Zedong may have taken the place of these images and scrolls during the Cultural Revolution, but now they were creeping back, alongside Mao. The Chinese family consists not only of the living, but also of generations of the dead.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sharing food, in China, binds the living family together, and it is also the ritual that connects those on both sides of the grave. On New Year's Eve, Liu Yaochun's extended family, from the grandparents down to the smallest child, processed to the orchard to invite their ancestors to join in the feast. They knelt on the ground, burning paper money and incense, kowtowing repeatedly, pouring libations of strong grain liquor into the earth. The uncles lit strings of firecrackers that shattered the air. Then everybody trooped over to the house of the eldest son, Liu Yaochun's uncle, where the men kowtowed before the main family shrine. The women had laid out a New Year's Eve dinner for the dead: little dishes of meat and vegetables, a bowl of noodles with chopsticks, cups of tea and wine.</div>

<div class="line_en">One of the peculiarities of the Chinese world of spirits and ancestors, for a foreigner, is its close resemblance to the earthly world. Chinese gods hold bureaucratic sway in their heavenly offices, considering petitions from mortal beings and accepting gifts and bribes much as communist officials do down below (and as imperial officials did before them). Dead people need material things just as the living do: clothing, money, and, these days, even mobile telephones. At funerals, relatives of the deceased burn paper effigies of all these objects, sending them heavenwards in a cloud of smoke. Special shops for mourning goods sell cars, washing machines, watches, and mobile phones, all made out of cardboard and coloured paper.</div>

<div class="line_en">The tombs of the wealthy were, in the past, well equipped for life beyond the grave. Most famously, the great, brutal unifying first emperor of China, Qin Shi Huangdi, was laid to rest with an entire terracotta army to protect him. My favourite Chinese tomb site, however, is at Mawangdui, near the Hunanese capital, Changsha, where a marquess was buried with his wife and son in the second century BC. The tombs were unearthed in the seventies, their contents in a state of almost miraculous preservation. This noble family was interred with scores of wooden figurines: servants to wait on them and musicians to entertain them. There were wooden models of chessboards and make-up boxes, musical instruments and luxurious gowns, and sophisticated medical and philosophical manuscripts painted on silk. There was also plenty of food, because, above all, the dead need to eat.</div>

There were painted lacquer wine cups inscribed with the phrase 'Gentlemen, please drink', and extravagant serving dishes. There was also a store of raw ingredients: many different grains, beasts and fowl, fruits, eggs, millet cakes and medicinal herbs that included cassia bark and Sichuan pepper.

<div class="line_en">Across the Chinese empire, people took care to satisfy the appetites of the dead. In the Astana Tombs of Turpan, on the edge of the Taklamakan desert, archaeologists have unearthed jiao zi dumplings in Tang Dynasty graves: a little dry and brittle, perhaps, but in all other respects exactly what you might have for lunch in the same region today, 1200 years later. The early twentieth century European explorer Aurel Stein returned from the same region with not only the priceless Dunhuang manuscripts, but also some 'jam tarts' and other pastries from the Astana tombs, which still lie in a vault in the British Museum. In Shaanxi Province in the Ming period, people were buried with miniature ceramic tables, laden with dishes of food modelled in clay: sheep's heads, whole chickens and fish, persimmons, peaches and pomegranates.</div>

They might lay little dishes of cooked food by their graves, home-smoked bacon, green beans and rice, whatever the rest of the family is eating, so the deceased seems to take part in a shared household meal. For long-dead ancestors, the food offerings on the shrine may be more abstract: a whole smoked pig's head, perhaps, or an unpeeled pomelo, neither of them immediately edible. In China, the worst thing you can do to a corpse is dismember it. Ghosts need their legs for walking, and their eyes for seeing. And their stomachs must be filled.</div>

<div class="line_en">On New Year's Day, Liu Yaochun and I continued with our exhausting round of visits, paying our respects in every house in the village, from dawn to dusk. The food we were offered was lavish by comparison with everyday fare, but varied little from home to home. We nibbled watermelon seeds and walnuts, dried persimmons, peanuts, tangerines, and sweets wrapped in cellophane. Then there were the main dishes: slices of pig's liver and pig's-ear terrine; braised pork ribs; pork slivers stir-fried with celery or green onion; pretty slices of a pork-and-egg roll; steamed porkballs studded with ricegrains; and whole river fish (an obligatory New Year's treat because 'having fish' -- you yu -- is a pun that also means 'having plenty'). The staple foods were sweet-potato noodles, wheat noodles, and little steamed buns, served with pickles, chilli and garlic. Each table was laid with nine bowls, arranged in a square.</div>

<div class="line_en">If a family elder entered the room, in whichever house we were visiting, Liu Yaochun and the other boys and men leapt to their feet and kowtowed before the family shrine. Liu Yaochun's knees were dusty with all these prostrations. One bearded grandfather we met wore a huge, rough sheepskin over his Mao suit and carried a wooden staff. He told Liu Yaochun he had discovered a miracle medicine. 'It is made with the charcoal from under the kang,' he said, 'and it can cure many diseases, including AIDS.' He handed Liu Yaochun some lumps of coal wrapped in paper. 'Since you are a research student at a university, perhaps you could investigate its scientific properties?' As Liu Yaochun pointed out to me later, 'this project has nothing to do with my major, which is medieval European history.' But in this place of reverence for the elderly, he listened carefully to the old man, nodding solemnly at his every word.</div>

<div class="line_en">Over the days, I met almost everyone in the village. There were the descendants of the former landlord, whose fortunes had been dramatically reversed in the land reforms of the fifties, but who were now clawing back their relative wealth with a successful minibus business. We exchanged pleasantries with the local communist party secretary, and with an old lady who hobbled around on tiny bound feet, encased in miniature black cotton shoes (the Nationalist government outlawed footbinding in 1911, but it persisted for years afterwards in out-of-the-way places like this).</div>

It was illegal, of course, to have so many children, but they had a relative in the local government who had forged a sterilisation document for the mother as a special favour. With so many mouths to feed, the parents were desperately poor: they had even been compelled to give away daughter Number Five for adoption. But they needed a son, badly. Daughters, in the traditional Chinese scheme of things, married out into other villages, so they were useless as pension schemes and future feeders of ancestors. ('My brother and I will have to support my parents in their old age,' Liu Yaochun told me, 'Because in the end, my sister doesn't really belong to the family.') Now, finally, after all these unlucky girls, they had a little emperor, plump and beautiful in his tasselled silk hat. The relief of everyone in the family was palpable.</div>

After nightfall, loud drumbeats drew us out into the street, and we spied the tail end of the New Year procession, wending its way up a nearby hill. It was an old tradition that had recently been revived -- such 'feudal' customs were banned under Mao. We ran to catch up. The air was electric with the clash of gongs and cymbals, and the frenetic beating of the drums. Homemade paper lanterns, lit by candles and held aloft on sticks, cast a flickering light over the shadowy crowd of figures and the jerky undulations of a dancing lion.

<div class="line_en">Later the procession left the temple and called on every house in the village, pouring into each courtyard in a rush of light and colour. Firecrackers rent the air, driving away evil spirits. Family members burned offerings at their ancestral shrines, and rewarded the dancers and the drummers with gifts of fruit and nuts. A sick woman knelt on the ground as the lion danced around her, and flaming ghost money was passed over her head. A paper lantern caught fire and withered in a blaze of light. Overhead, the new moon was a sliver of light amidst a glittering canopy of stars.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着游行队伍离开大庙，造访村里每一户人家。人群涌进每一个前院，变成流动的光影与色彩。烟花爆竹不断绽放炸响，驱赶妖魔鬼怪、邪神恶灵。人们在家里的灵堂前烧了供品，给前来道贺的舞狮人和打鼓汉子送上水果干货当谢礼。病弱的女人跪在地上，舞狮队绕着她跳了一圈，燃烧的纸钱也在她头上飘了一圈。一个纸灯笼着了火，瞬间就灰飞烟灭。头顶上的新月像一道银光，划破闪烁无垠的星空。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After the ceremony I was roped into what I can only describe as a kind of press conference. I was invited to sit on the kang in a side room, and the wedding guests crowded in to look at me. There were people trying to push in from the courtyard, craning their heads around the door, peering in at the window. The air was hazy with cigarette smoke.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="礼成之后我无处可逃，接下来发生的事情我只能形容为某种“新闻发布会”。人们邀请我到某个偏房的炕上，喜客们都挤进来要看看我。院子里还有人拼命要进来，在门边使劲探着脑袋，贴在窗户边上往里看。空气中，人们吞云吐雾，烟气弥漫升腾。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Shortly before I left the village, we were invited to attend a wedding, where a large, buxom young woman was entering into an arranged marriage with a slender young man whom she hardly knew. We watched them light the wedding incense, and make their bows to the gods, their parents, their ancestors and, finally, to each other.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="离开刘复兴他们村之前不久，有人邀请我们去喝喜酒。新娘高大丰满，新郎瘦弱矮小，两人是父母之命、媒妁之言，互相并不熟悉。我们看着一对新人敬了喜香，一拜天地、二拜高堂、夫妻对拜。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Someone took it upon himself to be the master of ceremonies, inviting members of the audience to quiz me. 'How can England be a democracy when it has a Queen?' asked someone. 'In your opinion is it better to have straight or curly hair?' demanded another. The eyes of one man widened in concern and amazement when I told him that Winston Churchill was dead. I felt a heavy sense of responsibility. To many of them, apparently, I was the outside world. I was the diplomatic representative not only of her majesty Queen Elizabeth, but of the nations of Europe, the United States of America, everywhere that wasn't China. So I tried not to laugh at the more ridiculous questions, I tried my best to answer seriously.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有人自封为主持人，邀请观众出点题来考考我。“你们英国有女王，为啥还叫民主国家啊？”其中一个问道。“你觉着直发好还是卷发好啊？”另一个接着发问。我告诉一个男人温斯顿·丘吉尔已经过世，他的双眼焦虑而震惊地瞪得老大。我感觉到沉重的责任感。这其中的大多数人都是第一次有机会拉着个外国人问点啥。很显然，在他们眼里，我不仅是伊丽莎白女王殿下的外交使节，还代表了欧洲各国、美利坚合众国、一切中国之外的地方。所以每个回答我都深思熟虑，听到特别荒谬的问题也尽量忍住笑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">My reward for this exhausting Q&amp;A session was a seat of honour at the wedding feast: a lavish spread of chicken with ginger, slow-braised belly pork, eggs and tomatoes, fried pork with spring onions, potato chips in honey sauce and whole fried fish. It was an incredible menu for rural Gansu in midwinter. The bride and groom made their rounds, toasting everyone with strong grain liquor. Enamel dishes of cigarettes lay on every table and the men smoked furiously, tucking extra cigarettes wherever they could -- in jacket pockets, behind their ears.</div>

<div class="line_en">By the end of the day I was succumbing to a rotten cold. Walking home with Liu Yaochun, I burst into tears. I couldn't help it: I was ill, I was tired, I was lonely. I had exhausted all my reserves of patience. I was sick of being a foreign diplomat, of having people nodding sagely at my every trivial utterance as if I was expressing the wisdom of Confucius. And I was desperate for privacy. All those nights on the kang, sleeping alongside the women of the family and occasional female visitors. The visitors watching, fascinated, as I poured hot water into the basin on the washstand in the morning, washed myself, dressed and undressed. Even when I went to the loo, on a designated patch of earth next to the orchard, I had to perform under the gentle scrutiny of the family's ass.</div>

<div class="line_en">Perhaps I was also feeling the weight of tradition on my shoulders. After two weeks in the village I was being sucked into its patriarchal vision, and it was one in which people like me didn't exist. Although only in my mid-twenties, I was already antique by local standards. The only other unwed woman my age I met, Hong Xia, was being married off in a few months to a man she barely knew, who lived in an even more impoverished village. She was dreading her wedding, but knew that if she waited any longer she wouldn't be able to find a husband, and the old village gossips would start to wonder if there was some sinister reason for her solitude.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我流泪可能还因为感觉到肩上有被传统加诸的重担。在乡村居住两周，我被不由自主地卷进家长制的幻象中，我这样的人原本对此完全没有概念。我也才二十五六，但用当地的标准来看已经是“古董”了。我在村里只见到一个与我同龄却还未婚配的女孩：她叫红霞，几个月后就要遵循长辈之命嫁给一个根本不怎么了解的男人；这个人的村儿更穷。她对喜宴十分恐惧，但也知道，要是再等下去，她恐怕就嫁不掉了。如果这样村里就会流言四起，议论她不嫁人是不是有什么见不得人的理由。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And then there was the disturbing matter of the Hungry Ghosts. In China, the worst thing you can do is to leave no descendants to honour your memory. The spirits of the childless, neglected and unfed, are malignant. They wander the earth looking for mischief, venomous in their hunger. During the seventh lunar month, the Ghost Month, the gates of the underworld open and the spirits of the dead pour forth. It's an inauspicious month, a bad time to move house or marry. It's a time when people make renewed offerings to their ancestors, serving them dinner and burning effigies of all the things that they might need in the coming year. But they take care not to forget the marauding Hungry Ghosts, who must be appeased by rice thrown into the sacrificial fire.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="想到那些饥饿的鬼魂，我也心烦意乱。中国人所谓“不孝有三，无后为大”，最糟糕的事情就是没有后代祭奠怀念自己。那些没有孩子、无人惦记、无人献祭的亡人都化为恶灵，在大地上四处游荡吓人，因为饥饿而心怀怨恨。农历的七月被称为“鬼月”，阴曹地府的门打开，亡人的灵魂纷纷飘上来。这是个不吉利的月份，忌入宅、忌嫁娶。人们用这个时候来给祖先贡献新的祭品，为他们端上饭菜，把未来一年可能需要的所有东西都烧给他们。但他们也很细心地不去忘记那些没有亲人的“饿灵”，抓起稻米扔进祭祀的火堆来安抚他们。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">People in China normally greet a young woman by asking her, first, if she is married, and then how old she is. If the answer to the first question is no, and to the second is more than about twenty-three (in a village like this), the response is a sharp intake of breath, and an expression of incredulity. Day after day, in this remote community, I was reminded that my whole life was invalid unless I married quickly, and reproduced. The Hungry Ghosts hovered in the background, menacing. Would I end up as one of them, I asked myself, roaming the streets of Oxford, yearning for sustenance, hoping that my nieces and nephews would remember to feed me?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一般来说，中国人遇到年轻女孩，第一句问候就是问她结婚没有、年纪多大。要是回答没结婚，年纪在二十三岁以上（在这样一个村庄），对方的反应通常是倒抽一口凉气，露出难以置信的表情。在这个偏远的山区，每一天都有人提醒我，要是不赶快结婚生子，我这一辈子就白过了。饿灵们仿佛就在背后盘旋游荡着，赤裸裸地威胁着我。我扪心自问，是否百年之后也会成为他们中的一员，飘荡在牛津的大街小巷，渴望有谁给我点食物，希望我的侄儿侄女们能记得喂我点东西吃？">查看中文翻译</div>

My stay in Liu Yaochun's village had been fascinating, but I certainly didn't want to live there. Chengdu, with its spirited women, gentle climate and marvellous food, felt much more like home. Liu Yaochun and I travelled back there together at the end of the holiday, on the long, slow train from Lanzhou, winding our way through the mountains as we philosophised endlessly and sipped from our mugs of green tea.</div>

<div class="line_en">But the end of my course at the Sichuan cooking school turned out to be just the beginning of a project that would take over my life. Back in London, I left the BBC and spent a year at the School of Oriental and African Studies, reading for a masters degree in Chinese studies and writing my final dissertation on Sichuanese food. My first proposal for a Sichuanese cookbook was rejected by six publishers, and after my course had ended I returned to work at the BBC, this time in radio. Living in London, I cooked my favourite Sichuanese dishes for various English friends, and the reception was often ecstatic. No one had ever tasted Chinese food like it before, so spicy and exciting. I was astonished by the absence of authentic Sichuanese restaurants in a city as diverse as London, and the near-total lack of Sichuanese recipe books in the English language.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但烹饪学校课程的结束，却标志着另一个项目的开始，它会占据我的人生。回到伦敦，我在伦敦大学亚非学院待了一年时间，攻读中国研究方向的硕士学位，并且撰写我关于川菜的毕业论文。我为那本想象中的川菜食谱写了份计划书，但遭到六家出版社的拒绝。硕士课程结束后，我找了份广播节目制作的工作。定居在伦敦的我为很多英国朋友烹制了最拿手的川菜，常常把他们吃得心醉神迷。没人吃过这样的中国菜，香辣爽口、令人兴奋。伦敦这么多元化的城市，竟然没有一家地道的川菜馆；英语如此运用广泛的语言，竟然找不到一本川菜食谱；这两者都让我震惊不已。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Towards the end of my time at the Sichuan Institute of Higher Cuisine, I began to think seriously about writing a Sichuanese cookery book. And I knew that if I wanted to do it, I had to go back to England, at least for a while. I was also running out of money, and needed to decide whether or not to return to my old job at the BBC. So, when my cooking course ended, I said farewell to my teachers and my fellow chefs, not knowing when I would see them again. I packed up my possessions, and sent home many boxes of things that seemed terribly important at the time but turned out to be useless in England, like Chinese army plimsolls, bamboo ornaments and thermal underwear. And then I left Chengdu, with an aching heart.</div>

<div class="line_en">After a year, I thought I would give the book one last try, so I wrote a much better proposal, and to my delight was offered a publishing contract. Thanks to the support of various BBC managers, I spent many months in Chengdu over the following three years, continuing my research.

<div class="line_en">Liu Yaochun and I, of course, continued to spend whole afternoons and evenings talking in teahouses. But he never shared my culinary passions. Liu Yaochun has always been a puritan when it comes to food. He grew up in the hard north, after all, on a diet of sweet potatoes, steamed buns and noodles, and he tut-tuts at the dietary promiscuity of the southern Chinese: 'They eat so many weird things. It's revolting. I really think there should be limits.' The amusing thing about our friendship is that, through me, he has found himself invited, over the years, to endless banquets in the finest restaurants in Chengdu. He acts as interpreter for foreign journalists on gastronomic tours, and is on friendly terms with some of the best chefs and cooking teachers in the city. 'I'd really be just as happy with a bowl of noodles,' he says with a self-deprecating grin, sitting down to another stupendous feast.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，刘复兴和我仍然是一下午、一整晚地在茶馆聊天。但他从未像我一样对烹饪与食物着迷。在吃食上，刘复兴一直是朴素克己的。毕竟，他在艰难困苦的北方长大，吃的总是红薯、蒸馒头和面条这几样，对华南地区这些丰富而杂乱的饮食，他总是发出不赞同的“啧啧”声：“他们吃得太奇怪了、太恶心了。我真觉得该克制一点的。”我们的友谊说来好笑，他发现跟我做朋友这些年，经常被邀请到成都最好的餐馆，赴各种各样的宴会。外国记者来成都进行美食之旅时，他担任了翻译，和城中很多顶级厨师与烹饪老师关系都很好。“我真的吃碗面就行了。”他有些谦虚、有些自嘲地咧嘴一笑，在又一场盛宴中落座。">查看中文翻译</div>
