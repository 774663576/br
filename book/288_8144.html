<div class="line_en">At that time George had rooms in the house of a lady called Mrs Gippings. One evening his watch stopped at a quarter past eight. He did not realize this then. When he went to bed, he took off his watch, and he did not look at it.</div>

<div class="line_en">I woke up at six o'clock the next morning, and I found that George was awake, too. We both tried to go to sleep again, but we could not. This was because we did not need to get up early. We could sleep for another two or three hours. But we both felt we would die if we tried to sleep for another five minutes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我早晨六点钟醒来，发现乔治也醒了。我们俩都想再睡一会儿，可怎么也睡不着了。这是因为我们不需要早起了，而且还可以再睡上两、三个小时。然而，哪怕再多睡五分钟，我们都会觉得立刻就要死了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'Good heavens!'George cried. 'I have to be at the bank by nine o'clock!'And he threw down the watch and jumped out of bed. He had a cold bath and he dressed. Then he ran and looked at his watch. It had started to go again, and it was twenty to nine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我的天哪！”乔治惊叫起来，“我九点钟要赶到银行呢！”说着扔了表，跳下床，匆匆用冷水洗了洗，穿上衣服，急急忙忙跑回去一看表，表又开始走了，现在是差二十分九点。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This happened in the winter, so it was dark in the mornings, anyway. When George woke up, he looked at his watch. It was a quarter past eight.</div>

<div class="line_en">George took his watch and ran downstairs. The dining-room was dark and silent. There was no fire, no breakfast. George was very angry with Mrs G. He decided to tell her this later, in the evening. Then he caught hold of his coat, his hat and his umbrella, and ran to the front door. lt'was locked! George said that Mrs G. was a lazy old woman. Then he unlocked the door and ran out into the street.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乔治抓起表，冲下楼。饭厅黑洞洞，静悄悄的，炉子没生，早餐也没做。乔治很生吉宾斯太太的气，晚上回来得好好和她理论理论。他拿着外衣，帽子和雨伞，跑到前门，门居然还锁着！乔治说吉宾斯太太真是个懒得要命的老太婆。他飞快地打开门，跑到街上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For a few hundred metres he ran as fast as he could. But, suddenly, he noticed that there were not many people about. He also noticed that the shops were not open. It was a very dark and foggy morning. However, it seemed very strange that they had closed the shops because of the fog. He had to go to work, so why should other people stay in bed?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他使出全力跑出去几百米，忽然注意到周围没几个人，店铺也没开门。那天早晨雾很大，天很黑，可是店铺要是因为雾大就停止营业，这可够奇怪的。他自己还得去上班，怎么别人就能在床上呆着呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">George could see only three people. One of them was a policeman, one was a man who was taking vegetables to the market, and one was a taxi-driver.</div>

<div class="line_en">George looked at his watch. It was five to nine. For a moment, he stood there without moving. He wondered if he was dreaming. He felt his wrist, and bent down and felt his legs. Then, with his watch in his hand, he went up to the policeman.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乔治又看看表，差五分钟九点。他站在那儿呆了一会儿，一动没动，好像还做着梦呢！他数数脉搏，又弯腰摸摸自己的腿。后来，他拿着表上前去问警察。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Of course, then the policemen wanted to know what he was doing. George said,'Nothing. I'm just going for a walk. 'But they did not believe him. In the end, two policemen went back to the house with him. They wanted to know if he really did live there. They watched him go in with his key. Then they stood on the opposite side of the road, and they watched the house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然了，人家警察也想知道他究竟想干什么。乔治说：“没什么，只是散散步。”但他们不相信乔治的话，后来两个警察和他一起回家，想看看他是不是真的住在那儿。他们看着乔治用钥匙开了门，便站在街对面，监视着这所屋子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When he got in, he thought,'I'll light the fire, and then I'll make some breakfast. 'But he made a lot of noise, and he was afraid that Mrs Gippings would wake up.

<div class="line_en">After that, we pulled up the cover and we put our heads over the side of the boat. We looked down at the water. The night before, we had decided to get up early. We would throw off the cover and we would jump into the water, with shouts of happiness. Then we would enjoy a long swim.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随后我们卷起篷布，把头探出船舷，低头看着水。头天晚上，我们还打算早起，扯掉帐篷，跳进水里，齐声欢呼几嗓子，再痛痛快快畅游一番。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I did not want to give up the idea absolutely. I decided to go down to the edge of the river, and then splash some water over myself. So I went out on to the river bank, and I began to move carefully along the branch of a tree which was over the water.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was very cold, and I thought I would not splash water over myself, after all. I would go back into the boat and dress. I turned -- and just then the stupid branch broke. The next minute, I was in the middle of the river, with half a litre of the Thames inside me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="真冷啊！我不准备往身上泼冷水了。我想回到船上穿衣服——就在这当间，那个该死的树枝折断了。再看我呢，已经在河中央了，肚子里灌了足足有半升泰晤士河水。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When I got back to the boat, I was very cold. I wanted to put on my shirt as quickly as possible. By accident, I dropped it into the water. This made me very angry, but George started to laugh. 'I can't see anything to laugh at,'I told George. He just went on laughing! In fact, I never saw a man laugh so much. In the end, I became really angry with him. I told him what I thought about him. He laughed more loudly. And then, just as I was getting the shirt back out of the water, I noticed that it was not my shirt. So I began to laugh, too. I looked at George, who was laughing so much. Then I looked at the wet shirt -- and I laughed more and more. Because I was laughing so much, I dropped the shirt in the water again.</div>

<div class="line_en">Harris had some trouble when he tried to break the eggs. He had trouble stopping them from getting onto his trousers. And he had more trouble trying to stop them from going up his arms. Finally, he managed to get about six of the eggs into the pan. Then he sat down and started to cook them.</div>

<div class="line_en">It seemed to be very difficult work. Whenever he went near the pan, he burnt himself. Then he dropped everything, and danced about, and waved his hands, and shouted.

<div class="line_cn" title="这个工作太复杂了。只要哈里斯一靠近锅子，准得烫着自己，把什么都扔了，甩着手跳来舞去，又喊又叫的。事实上，我和乔治每次看他，他总是那样表演着。起初我们还以为煎个鸡蛋，这样大呼小叫都是必不可少的一道工序呢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I have never seen a man's face change so quickly. I tried to make him see that it was very funny, but he did not agree with me.</div>

<div class="line_en">After that, it was time for breakfast, and we decided to have eggs. Harris said he would cook them. He said he was very good at doing eggs.

<div class="line_cn" title="到吃早餐的时间了，我们想吃煎鸡蛋，哈里斯说他来做。听他讲他特别会煎鸡蛋，吃了他煎的鸡蛋就会觉得吃什么也不香了。“没有我的煎鸡蛋，他们宁可不吃饭，”他说，“最后就饿得一命呜呼了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
