<div class="line_en">The first few days, Mariam hardly left her room. She was awakened every dawn for prayer by the distant cry of azan, after which she crawled back into bed. She was still in bed when she heard Rasheed in the bathroom, washing up, when he came into her room to check on her before he went to his shop. From her window, she watched him in the yard, securing his lunch in the rear carrier pack of his bicycle, then walking his bicycle across the yard and into the street. She watched him pedal away, saw his broad, thick-shouldered figure disappear around the turn at the end of the street.</div>

<div class="line_en">For most of the days, Mariam stayed in bed, feeling adrift and forlorn. Sometimes she went downstairs to the kitchen, ran her hands over the sticky, grease-stained counter, the vinyl, flowered curtains that smelled like burned meals. She looked through the ill-fitting drawers, at the mismatched spoons and knives, the colander and chipped, wooden spatulas, these would-be instruments of her new daily life, all of it reminding her of the havoc that had struck her life, making her feel uprooted, displaced, like an intruder on someone else's life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些日子里，玛丽雅姆多数时间都待在床上，总有着空荡荡的、被人遗弃的感觉。有时候，她会走下楼，到厨房去，用手去摸摸那黏糊糊的、满是油脂的橱柜，碰碰那印着花朵图案的塑料窗帘。窗帘散发出一股烧肉的味道。她打开那些做工粗糙的抽屉，看着不成套的勺子和刀具，还有漏锅和有缺口的木头锅铲，这些都将成为她的新生活中的工具。所有这些令她想起了自己的悲惨遭遇，使她觉得自己身处他乡异里，不知身在何方，好像闯进了别人的生活。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At the kolba, her appetite had been predictable. Here, her stomach rarely growled for food. Sometimes she took a plate of leftover white rice and a scrap of bread to the living room, by the window. From there, she could see the roofs of the one-story houses on their street. She could see into their yards too, the women working laundry lines and shooing their children, chickens pecking at dirt, the shovels and spades, the cows tethered to trees.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在泥屋，她的肚子每到该吃饭的时候就饿了。在这里，她很少想起来要吃饭。有时她会带着一盘隔顿的白米饭和一片面包到客厅去，站在窗口旁边。从那儿她能看到他们那条街上那些平房的屋顶。她还可以望见它们的院子，见到各户人家的女人在晾衣服、一边叫喊一边追赶孩子，看见小鸡在啄食泥土，看到铁铲和铁锹，还有那些系在树上的牛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She thought longingly of all the summer nights that she and Nana had slept on the flat roof of the kolba, looking at the moon glowing over Gul Daman, the night so hot their shirts would cling to their chests like a wet leaf to a window. She missed the winter afternoons of reading in the kolba with Mullah Faizullah, the clink of icicles falling on her roof from the trees, the crows cawing outside from snow-burdened branches.</div>

<div class="line_en">She set three cups of lentils to soak in a pot, found a knife and cut some carrots and a pair of potatoes, left them too to soak. She searched for flour, found it in the back of one of the cabinets behind a row of dirty spice jars, and made fresh dough, kneading it the way Nana had shown her, pushing the dough with the heel of her hand, folding the outer edge, turning it, and pushing it away again. Once she had floured the dough, she wrapped it in a moist cloth, put on a hijab, and set out for the communal tandoor.</div>

<div class="line_en">Rasheed had told her where it was, down the street, a left then a quick right, but all Mariam had to do was follow the flock of women and children who were headed the same way. The children Mariam saw, chasing after their mothers or running ahead of them, wore shirts patched and patched again. They wore trousers that looked too big or too small, sandals with ragged straps that flapped back and forth. They rolled discarded old bicycle tires with sticks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拉希德跟她说过烤炉的位置，沿街道走下去，先向左转，紧接着向右转，但玛丽雅姆只能跟随一群沿着同一条路前行的妇女和儿童。玛丽雅姆看到那些小孩穿着打满补丁的衣服，有的在他们的母亲身后追逐，有的跑在她们的前头。他们的裤子看上去不是太大就是太小，脚下的破拖鞋发出啪哒、啪哒的声音。他们用棍子滚着废弃的旧自行车轮胎。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This endless conversation, the tone plaintive but oddly cheerful, flew around and around in a circle. On it went, down the street, around the corner, in line at the tandoor. Husbands who gambled. Husbands who doted on their mothers and wouldn't spend a rupiah on them, the wives. Mariam wondered how so many women could suffer the same miserable luck, to have married, all of them, such dreadful men. Or was this a wifely game that she did not know about, a daily ritual, like soaking rice or making dough? Would they expect her soon to join in?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这无穷无尽的交谈，这平淡但偶尔兴奋的语调，不断地在玛丽雅姆耳边回响。她就听着这些闲聊，沿着街道走下去，转过街角，排到烤炉前面的队伍中去。有些丈夫喜欢赌钱。有些丈夫对他们的母亲有求必应，却不愿在她们——这些妻子——身上花一分钱。玛丽雅姆心下奇怪，怎么会有这么多女人都有着相同的悲惨遭遇，她们怎么都跟这么可怕的男人成为夫妻。又或者这只是一个她所不了解的、妻子之间的游戏，一种日常的仪式，就像浸泡大米和揉面团一样？她们会希望她很快也加入吗？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then someone tapped her on the shoulder. Mariam turned around and found a light-skinned, plump woman wearing a hijab, like her. She had short, wiry black hair and a good-humored, almost perfectly round face. Her lips were much fuller than Mariam's, the lower one slightly droopy, as though dragged down by the big, dark mole just below the lip line. She had big greenish eyes that shone at Mariam with an inviting glint.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后有人拍了拍她的肩膀。玛丽雅姆转过身，看见一个丰腴的女人，这个女人肤色较白，和她一样，也戴着面纱。她有一头既短且粗的黑发，一张欢快的、浑圆的脸庞。她的嘴唇比玛丽雅姆的丰厚，下唇稍微有点下垂，好像是被紧接着下唇的那块大黑痣拉下去似的。她一双明亮的绿色大眼睛带着期盼向玛丽雅姆看来。">查看中文翻译</div>

She ran up then down the street, panting, near tears now, began trying doors blindly. Some were locked, others opened only to reveal unfamiliar yards, barking dogs, and startled chickens. She pictured Rasheed coming home to find her still searching this way, her knee bleeding, lost on her own street. Now she did start crying. She pushed on doors, muttering panicked prayers, her face moist with tears, until one opened, and she saw, with relief, the outhouse, the well, the toolshed. She slammed the door behind her and turned the bolt. Then she was on all fours, next to the wall, retching. When she was done, she crawled away, sat against the wall, with her legs splayed before her. She had never in her life felt so alone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽雅姆拐了一个弯，又拐了一个弯。她发现这条路是对的，但突然想不起来哪间才是拉希德的房子。她沿着街道跑上跑下，气喘吁吁，泪水差点就要夺眶而出，开始盲目地去推推那些房门。有的上了锁，有的打开了，但露出的只是陌生的院子、吠叫的狗和吓坏了的小鸡。她想像拉希德走回家，发现她膝盖流血，在自己的街道上迷了路，依旧这样茫无头绪地找自己的房子。她哭了起来。她推开一扇又一扇大门，张皇失措地求真主保佑，脸上泪水涟涟，直到有一扇门被推开了，她看到那个厕所，那口井，还有那间摆放工具的棚屋，终于松了一口气。她走了进去，砰地把门甩上，上了门闩。接着她在墙边躺下，不断作呕。喘过气之后，她爬了起来，靠墙壁坐着，双脚伸展在前方。有生以来，她第一次觉得如此孤独。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She poured water for him from the aftawa to wash his hands with. As he dried with a towel, she put before him a steaming bowl of daal and a plate of fluffy white rice. This was the first meal she had cooked for him, and Mariam wished she had been in a better state when she made it. She'd still been shaken from the incident at the tandoor as she'd cooked, and all day she had fretted about the daal's consistency, its color, worried that he would think she'd stirred in too much ginger or not enough turmeric.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽雅姆从一个圆形的敞口盆给他倒了水，让他洗手。他用毛巾擦手的时候，她把一碗蒸汽腾腾的豆汤和一盘松软的白米饭端到他面前。这是她为他做的第一顿饭，玛丽雅姆心想，要是做饭的时候她的状态更好一些就好了。煮饭时，她还在为烤炉边发生的事情颤抖。她一整天都在害怕豆汤不够浓，颜色不够好看，担心他会认为她放了太多的生姜或者放的姜母不够。">查看中文翻译</div>

They think nothing of a stranger touching their wives' bare feet! They think they're being modern men, intellectuals, on account of their education, I suppose. They don't see that they're spoiling their own nang and namoos, their honor and pride."</div>
