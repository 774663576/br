<div class="line_en">Harry dressed and went down the spiral staircase into the common room. The moment he appeared, the people who had already finished breakfast broke into applause again. The prospect of going down into the Great Hall and facing the rest of the Gryffindors, all treating him like some sort of hero, was not inviting; it was that, however, or stay here and allow himself to be cornered by the Creevey brothers, who were both beckoning frantically to him to join them. He walked resolutely over to the portrait hole, pushed it open, climbed out of it, and found himself face-to-face with Hermione.</div>

<div class="line_en">When Harry woke up on Sunday morning, it took him a moment to remember why he felt so miserable and worried. Then the memory of the previous night rolled over him. He sat up and ripped back the curtains of his own four-poster, intending to talk to Ron, to force Ron to believe him -- only to find that Ron's bed was empty; he had obviously gone down to breakfast.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, of course I knew you hadn't entered yourself," she said when he'd finished telling her about the scene in the chamber off the Hall.

<div class="line_en">They went downstairs, crossed the entrance hall quickly without looking in at the Great Hall, and were soon striding across the lawn toward the lake, where the Durmstrang ship was moored, reflected blackly in the water. It was a chilly morning, and they kept moving, munching their toast, as Harry told Hermione exactly what had happened after he had left the Gryffindor table the night before. To his immense relief, Hermione accepted his story without question.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Look," said Hermione patiently, "it's always you who gets all the attention, you know it is. I know it's not your fault," she added quickly, seeing Harry open his mouth furiously. "I know you don't ask for it… but -- well -- you know, Ron's got all those brothers to compete against at home, and you're his best friend, and you're really famous -- he's always shunted to one side whenever people see you, and he puts up with it, and he never mentions it, but I suppose this is just one time too many…"</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，好吧，我给他写信。”哈利说着，把最后一片面包扔进了湖里。两人站在那里，注视着面包在湖面上漂浮了一阵，随即一只巨大的触手冒出水面，把它抓到水下去了。然后他们便返回了城堡。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dear Sirius, You told me to keep you posted on what's happening at Hogwarts, so here goes -- I don't know if you've heard, but the Triwizard Tournament's happening this year and on Saturday night I got picked as a fourth champion. I don't who put my name in the Goblet of Fire, because I didn't. The other Hogwarts champion is Cedric Diggory, from Hufflepuff.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Finished," he told Hermione, getting to his feet and brushing straw off his robes. At this, Hedwig fluttered down onto his shoulder and held out her leg.</div>

<div class="line_en">If Harry had thought that matters would improve once everyone got used to the idea of him being champion, the following day showed him how mistaken he was. He could no longer avoid the rest of the school once he was back at lessons -- and it was clear that the rest of the school, just like the Gryffindors, thought Harry had entered himself for the tournament. Unlike the Gryffindors, however, they did not seem impressed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果哈利以为一旦大家习惯了他是勇士，情况就会有所好转，那么他第二天就会发现自己是大错特错了。重新开始上课以后，他就再也无法躲避学校的其他同学了——而显然另外几个学院的同学也像格兰芬多们一样，以为哈利是自己报名参加争霸赛的。不过他们和格兰芬多们不同，他们似乎觉得这件事并不很光彩。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Hufflepuffs, who were usually on excellent terms with the Gryffindors, had turned remarkably cold toward the whole lot of them. One Herbology lesson was enough to demonstrate this. It was plain that the Hufflepuffs felt that Harry had stolen their champion's glory; a feeling exacerbated, perhaps, by the fact that Hufflepuff House very rarely got any glory, and that Cedric was one of the few who had ever given them any, having beaten Gryffindor once at Quidditch. Ernie Macmillan and Justin FinchFletchley, with whom Harry normally got on very well, did not talk to him even though they were repotting Bouncing Bulbs at the same tray -- though they did laugh rather unpleasantly when one of the Bouncing Bulbs wriggled free from Harry's grip and smacked him hard in the face. Ron wasn't talking to Harry either. Hermione sat between them, making very forced conversation, but though both answered her normally, they avoided making eye contact with each other. Harry thought even Professor Sprout seemed distant with him -- but then, she was Head of Hufflepuff House.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="赫奇帕奇们一向和格兰芬多们相处得很好，可现在也突然对他们全都冷淡起来。一次草药课就足以证明这一点。显然，赫奇帕奇们觉得哈利盗取了他们勇士的光荣。由于赫奇帕奇学院很少获得什么光荣——塞德里克是少数几个给他们带来光荣的人之一，他曾经在魁地奇比赛中打败了格兰芬多院——这就使他们的这种怨恨情绪更加强烈了。厄尼·麦克米兰和贾斯廷·芬列里本来和哈利关系是很不错的，现在也不跟他说话了，尽管他们几个人在同一个托盘上移植跳跳球茎——不过，当一个跳跳球茎扭动着从哈利手里挣脱、在他脸上重重打了一下时，他们都幸灾乐祸地哈哈大笑起来，使人心里很不舒服。罗恩也不跟哈利说话了。赫敏坐在他们俩中间，勉强找出些话来。哈利和罗恩各自跟赫敏倒是有问有答，表现正常，可是他们俩却互相躲着对方的目光。哈利觉得就连斯普劳特教授似乎也对他冷淡起来——也难怪啊，她是赫奇帕奇学院的院长嘛。">查看中文翻译</div>

To the class's horror, Hagrid proceeded to explain that the reason the skrewts had been killing one another was an excess of pent-up energy, and that the solution would be for each student to fix a leash on a skrewt and take it for a short walk. The only good thing about this plan was that it distracted Malfoy completely.</div>

<div class="line_en">The pair of them looked out over the lawn; the class was widely scattered now, and all in great difficulty. The skrewts were now over three feet long, and extremely powerful. No longer shell-less and colorless, they had developed a kind of thick, grayish, shiny armor. They looked like a cross between giant scorpions and elongated crabs -- but still without recognizable heads or eyes. They had become immensely strong and very hard to control.</div>

<div class="line_en">The next few days were some of Harry's worst at Hogwarts. The closest he had ever come to feeling like this had been during those months, in his second year, when a large part of the school had suspected him of attacking his fellow students. But Ron had been on his side then. He thought he could have coped with the rest of the school's behavior if he could just have had Ron back as a friend, but he wasn't going to try and persuade Ron to talk to him if Ron didn't want to. Nevertheless, it was lonely with dislike pouring in on him from all sides.</div>

<div class="line_en">He could understand the Hufflepuffs' attitude, even if he didn't like it; they had their own champion to support. He expected nothing less than vicious insults from the Slytherins -- he was highly unpopular there and always had been, because he had helped Gryffindor beat them so often, both at Quidditch and in the Inter-House Championship. But he had hoped the Ravenclaws might have found it in their hearts to support him as much as Cedric. He was wrong, however. Most Ravenclaws seemed to think that he had been desperate to earn himself a bit more fame by tricking the goblet into accepting his name.</div>

Twelve and a quarter inches… ash… pleasantly springy. It's in fine condition… You treat it regularly?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Four summers ago, on his eleventh birthday, he had entered Mr. Ollivander's shop with Hagrid to buy a wand. Mr. Ollivander had taken his measurements and then started handing him wands to try. Harry had waved what felt like every wand in the shop, until at last he had found the one that suited him -- this one, which was made of holly, eleven inches long, and contained a single feather from the tail of a phoenix. Mr. Ollivander had been very surprised that Harry had been so compatible with this wand. "Curious," he had said, "curious," and not until Harry asked what was curious had Mr. Olhivander explained that the phoenix feather in Harry's wand had come from the same bird that had supplied the core of Lord Voldemort's.</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry had never shared this piece of information with anybody. He was very fond of his wand, and as far as he was concerned its relation to Voldemort's wand was something it couldn't help -- rather as he couldn't help being related to Aunt Petunia. However, he really hoped that Mr. Ollivander wasn't about to tell the room about it. He had a funny feeling Rita Skeeter's Quick-Quotes Quill might just explode with excitement if he did.</div>

<div class="line_en">The photographs took a long time. Madame Maxime cast everyone else into shadow wherever she stood, and the photographer couldn't stand far enough back to get her into the frame; eventually she had to sit while everyone else stood around her. Karkaroff kept twirling his goatee around his finger to give it an extra curl; Krum, whom Harry would have thought would have been used to this sort of thing, skulked, half-hidden, at the back of the group. The photographer seemed keenest to get Fleur at the front, but Rita Skeeter kept hurrying forward and dragging Harry into greater prominence. Then she insisted on separate shots of all the champions. At last, they were free to go.</div>
