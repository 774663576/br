<div class="line_en">Harry wracked his brains over the next week as to how he was to persuade Slughorn to hand over the true memory, but nothing in the nature of a brain wave occurred and he was reduced to doing what he did increasingly these days when at a loss: poring over his Potions book, hoping that the Prince would have scribbled something useful in a margin, as he had done so many times before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在接下来的一个星期里，哈利绞尽脑汁地考虑着怎么能让斯拉格霍恩交出真实的记忆，可是没有一点儿灵感，他只好做起如今他在无计可施时做得越来越多的事情：翻他的魔药课本，希望王子在空白处写了点高招。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry ignored her. He had just found an incantation "Sectum-sempra!" scrawled in a margin above the intriguing words "For enemies," and was itching to try it out, but thought it best not to in front of Hermione. Instead, he surreptitiously folded down the corner of the page.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利不理她，他刚发现空白处写了个咒语（神锋无影！），下面还有“对敌人”三个有趣的字。哈利心里痒痒的很想试一下，但觉得最好不要在赫敏跟前试，便偷偷把页角折了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They were sitting beside the fire in the common room; the only other people awake were fellow sixth years. There had been a certain amount of excitement earlier when they had come back from dinner to find a new sign on the notice board that announced the date for their Apparition Test. Those who would be seventeen on or before the first test date, the twenty-first of April, had the option of signing up for additional practice sessions, which would take place (heavily supervised) in Hogsmeade.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ron had panicked on reading this notice; he had still not man-aged to Apparate and feared he would not be ready for the test. Hermione, who had now achieved Apparition twice, was a little more confident, but Harry, who would not be seventeen for another four months, could not take the test whether ready or not.</div>

<div class="line_en">Having wasted a lot of time worrying aloud about Apparition, Ron was now struggling to finish a viciously difficult essay for Snape that Harry and Hermione had already completed. Harry fully expected to receive low marks on his, because he had disagreed with Snape on the best way to tackle dementors, but he did not care: Slughorns memory was the most important thing to him now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="浪费了很多时间唠叨对幻影显形的担心之后，罗恩正在痛苦地给斯内普写一篇特别难的论文。哈利跟赫敏都已写完了。哈利等着得低分，因为他在对付摄魂怪的最佳办法上与斯内普不一致。但哈利不在乎，现在对他来说，拿到斯拉格霍恩的记忆才是最重要的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“——不是坟墓吧？”罗恩笑道，“也许是下水道……”桃金娘发出一声愤怒的号叫，钻回了抽水马桶，水溅在马桶的周围和地板上。刺激桃金娘似乎让罗恩重新获得了勇气。“你说得对，”他说着把书包甩回肩上，“我要参加霍格莫德的特殊训练，然后再决定去不去考试。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And so the following weekend, Ron joined Hermione and the rest of the sixth years who would turn seventeen in time to take the test in a fortnight. Harry felt rather jealous watching them all get ready to go into the village; he missed making trips there, and it was a particularly fine spring day, one of the first clear skies they had seen in a long time. However, he had decided to use the time to attempt another assault on the Room of Requirement.</div>

<div class="line_en">As it was Sunday morning, nearly all the students were inside their various common rooms, the Gryffindors in one tower, the Ravenclaws in another, the Slytherins in the dungeons, and the Hufflepuffs in the basement near the kitchens. Here and there a stray person meandered around the library or up a corridor. There were a few people out in the grounds, and there, alone in the seventh-floor corridor, was Gregory Goyle. There was no sign of the Room of Requirement, but Harry was not worried about that; if Goyle was standing guard outside it, the room was open, whether the map was aware of it or not. He therefore sprinted up the stairs, slowing down only when he reached the corner into the corridor, when he began to creep, very slowly, toward the very same little girl, clutching her heavy brass scales, that Hermione had so kindly helped a fortnight before. He waited until he was right behind her before bending very low and whispering, "Hello… you're very pretty, aren't you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因为是星期天上午，几乎所有的学生都在各自的公共休息室里，格兰芬多的在一座塔楼，拉文克劳的在另一座，斯莱特林的在地下教室里，赫奇帕奇的在厨房附近的地下室。有零零星星的人在图书馆或走廊闲逛……还有几个人在操场上……看到了，高尔一个人在八楼走廊上。地图上看不到有求必应屋，但哈利不担心这一点。如果高尔在外面放哨，那么屋子就是开着的，无论地图知不知道。他箭步冲上楼梯，到了走廊口的拐角处才放慢脚步。他蹑手蹑脚地向赫敏两星期前好心帮过的那个端着铜天平的小女孩走去，一直走到她身后，才弯下腰小声说：“你好……你很漂亮，是不是？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Once out of sight of the entrance hall, Harry pulled the Marauder's Map and his Invisibility Cloak from his bag. Having concealed himself, he tapped the map, murmured, "I solemnly swear that I am up to no good," and scanned it carefully.</div>

<div class="line_en">Yet this hopeful mood did not last long. Half an hour later, having tried many more variations of his request to see what Malfoy was up to, the wall was just as doorless as ever. Harry felt frustrated beyond belief Malfoy might be just feet away from him, and there was still not the tiniest shred of evidence as to what he was doing in there. Losing his patience completely, Harry ran at the wall and kicked it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是乐观的情绪没有维持多久。他花了半个小时，又试了很多说法，墙上还是没有出现门。哈利感到遭受了难以置信的挫折，马尔福近在咫尺，却半点也看不出他在干什么。哈利彻底失去了耐心，冲过去朝墙上踢了一脚。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Goyle gave a high-pitched scream of terror, threw the scales up into the air, and sprinted away, vanishing from sight long before the sound of the scales smashing had stopped echoing around the corridor. Laughing, Harry turned to contemplate the blank wall behind which, he was sure, Draco Malfoy was now standing frozen, aware that someone unwelcome was out there, but not daring to make an appearance. It gave Harry a most agreeable feeling of power as he tried to remember what form of words he had not yet tried.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="高尔惊恐地尖叫了一声，把天平扔向空中，撒腿就跑，在天平摔到地上的回响散去前早就跑得没踪影了。哈利大笑着转身面对着那段空墙，他相信德拉科·马尔福正僵立在后面，知道外面有不受欢迎的人却不敢出来。这给了哈利一种非常痛快的气势，他开始想还有哪种说法没试过。">查看中文翻译</div>
