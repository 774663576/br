<div class="line_en">When the truck had gone, loaded with implements, with heavy tools, with beds and springs, with every movable thing that might be sold, Tom hung around the place. He mooned into the barn shed, into the empty stalls, and he walked into the implement lean-to and kicked the refuse that was left, turned a broken mower tooth with his foot. He visited places he remembered -- the red bank where the swallows nested, the willow tree over the pig pen. Two shoats grunted and squirmed at him through the fence, black pigs, sunning and comfortable. And then his pilgrimage was over, and he went to sit on the doorstep where the shade was lately fallen. Behind him Ma moved about in the kitchen, washing children's clothes in a bucket; and her strong freckled arms dripped soapsuds from the elbows. She stopped her rubbing when he sat down. She looked at him a long time, and at the back of his head when he turned and stared out at the hot sunlight. And then she went back to her rubbing.</div>

Used to read ever' word in that almanac out loud -- letters from folks that couldn't sleep or had lame backs. An' later he'd give them people for a lesson, an' he'd say, 'That's a par'ble from Scripture.' Your Pa an' Uncle John troubled 'im some about it when they'd laugh." She piled wrung clothes like cord wood on the table. "They say it's two thousan' miles where we're goin'. How far ya think that is, Tom?

"I heerd talkin'," he said. "Sons-a-bitches won't let a ol' fella sleep. When you bastards get dry behin' the ears, you'll maybe learn to let a ol' fella sleep." His furious fingers managed to flip open the only two buttons on his fly that had been buttoned. And his hand forgot what it had been trying to do. His hand reached in and contentedly scratched under the testicles. Ma came in with wet hands, and her palms puckered and bloated from hot water and soap.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the late afternoon the truck came back, bumping and rattling through the dust, and there was a layer of dust in the bed, and the hood was covered with dust, and the headlights were obscured with a red flour. The sun was setting when the truck came back, and the earth was bloody in its setting light. Al sat bent over the wheel, proud and serious and efficient, and Pa and Uncle John, as befitted the heads of the clan, had the honor seats beside the driver. Standing in the truck bed, holding onto the bars of the sides, rode the others, twelve-year-old Ruthie and ten-year-old Winfield, grime-faced and wild, their eyes tired but excited, their fingers and the edges of their mouths black and sticky from licorice whips, whined out of their father in town. Ruthie, dressed in a real dress of pink muslin that came below her knees, was a little serious in her young-ladiness. But Winfield was still a trifle of a snot-nose, a little of a brooder back of the barn, and an inveterate collector and smoker of snipes. And whereas Ruthie felt the might, the responsibility, and the dignity of her developing breasts, Winfield was kid-wild and calfish. Beside them, clinging lightly to the bars, stood Rose of Sharon, and she balanced, swaying on the balls of her feet, and took up the road shock in her knees and hams. For Rose of Sharon was pregnant and careful. Her hair, braided and wrapped around her head, made an ash-blond crown. Her round soft face, which had been voluptuous and inviting a few months ago, had already put on the barrier of pregnancy, the self-sufficient smile, the knowing perfection-look; and her plump body -- full soft breasts and stomach, hard hips and buttocks that had swung so freely and provocatively as to invite slapping and stroking -- her whole body had become demure and serious. Her whole thought and action were directed inward on the baby. She balanced on her toes now, for the baby's sake. And the world was pregnant to her; she thought only in terms of reproduction and of motherhood. Connie, her nineteen-year-old husband, who had married a plump, passionate hoyden, was still frightened and bewildered at the change in her; for there were no more cat fights in bed, biting and scratching with muffled giggles and final tears. There was a balanced, careful, wise creature who smiled shyly but very firmly at him. Connie was proud and fearful of Rose of Sharon. Whenever he could, he put a hand on her or stood close, so that his body touched her at hip and shoulder, and he felt that this kept a relation that might be departing. He was a sharp-faced, lean young man of a Texas strain, and his pale blue eyes were sometimes dangerous and sometimes kindly, and sometimes frightened. He was a good hard worker and would make a good husband. He drank enough, but not too much; fought when it was required of him; and never boasted. He sat quietly in a gathering and yet managed to be there and to be recognized.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="傍晚时候，卡车回来了，一路在尘沙里颠簸飞驰，底板上积了一层尘土，车头的盖子上蒙了一层尘土，连车前的头灯也被红色的灰尘蒙住了。卡车开回来的时候，太阳正在西沉，大地承受了落日的余晖，染上了血红的颜色。奥尔坐在那里，俯身在方向盘上，又得意、又严肃、又能干的样子；爸和约翰伯伯坐在司机旁边的荣誉座上，正跟家长的身份相称。其余的人站在车身的底板上，揪住了车两边的横档，有十二岁的露西和十岁的温菲尔德，一副顽皮的模样；他们的眼睛显得倦乏而又兴奋，他们的手指头和嘴角还有黏糊糊的黑印迹，因为嚼过在市镇上哭闹着向他们父亲讨来的甘草棒糖。露西穿着一件长到膝下的淡红色女童装，略略有些装正经的小妇人的神气。但是温菲尔德却还脱不了拖着鼻涕、爱在仓棚后面发愣、到处拾烟屁股吸一吸的顽皮孩子的寒伧相。露西已经感到自己那对发育着的乳房的力量，感到它们的责任和尊严，而温菲尔德却还是个愣头愣脑的野孩子。罗莎夏轻轻地抓住横档，站在他们身边。她踮着脚尖站在那儿，一摇一摆，极力保持平衡，用大腿和屁股承受着一路的颠簸。她已经怀了孕，所以很小心谨慎。她那编成辫子盘在头上的头发成了一顶灰黄色的宝冠。她那娇嫩的圆脸，几个月以前还风骚诱人，现在已经摆出那副有了身孕后的端庄的仪容、自满的微笑和自觉十全十美的神情；她那胖胖的身子——饱满而柔软的乳房和肚子，还有那结实的屁股，自由自在地摆动着，富有诱惑力，仿佛要挑逗人家去拍一拍、摸一摸似的——现在她的整个身子已经变得稳重而端庄了。她的全部心思和行动都向着肚里的婴孩。为了婴孩，她现在才踮着脚尖，使身子稳定。在她看来，整个世界也是怀孕了；她的脑子里只转着繁殖和母性的念头。她那十九岁的丈夫康尼，娶了这么个胖胖的、多情的少女，对她的变化还在感到惊讶和惶惑；因为他们已经不再在床上抓着咬着学猫斗，不再抿着嘴笑，不再嬉闹得迸出眼泪来了。她现在是个稳重、谨慎而贤惠的人儿，对他含蓄而又沉着地微笑着。康尼有罗莎夏这样一个妻子，感觉到又得意、又害怕。只要有机会，他就把一只手放在她身上，或是靠近她站着，使自己的身子接触到她的大腿或是肩膀；他觉得这样才能维持住一种可能会失去的亲热关系。他是一个瘦身材的青年，长着一张得克萨斯人气质的尖脸，他那双淡蓝的眼睛有时凶狠，有时和气，有时惊恐。他是个善良而勤劳的工人，也能做个好丈夫。他喝酒喝得不少，但并不过量；不得已的时候，他也会跟人家斗一场；可是他决不夸口。他静静地坐在人群中，勉强待在那儿，让人家知道他在场。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Had he not been fifty years old, and so one of the natural rulers of the family, Uncle John would have preferred not to sit in the honor place beside the driver. He would have liked Rose of Sharon to sit there. This was impossible, because she was young and a woman. But Uncle John sat uneasily, his lonely haunted eyes were not at ease, and his thin strong body was not relaxed. Nearly all the time the barrier of loneliness cut Uncle John off from people and from appetites. He ate little, drank nothing, and was celibate. But underneath, his appetites swelled into pressures until they broke through. Then he would eat of some craved food until he was sick; or he would drink jake or whisky until he was a shaken paralytic with red wet eyes; or he would raven with lust for some whore in Sallisaw. It was told of him that once he went clear to Shawnee and hired three whores in one bed, and snorted and rutted on their unresponsive bodies for an hour. But when one of his appetites was sated, he was sad and ashamed and lonely again. He hid from people, and by gifts tried to make up to all people for himself. Then he crept into houses and left gum under pillows for children; then he cut wood and took no pay. Then he gave away any possession he might have: a saddle, a horse, a new pair of shoes. One could not talk to him then, for he ran away, or if confronted hid within himself and peeked out of frightened eyes. The death of his wife, followed by months of being alone, had marked him with guilt and shame and had left an unbreaking loneliness on him.</div>

Al, bending over the wheel, kept shifting eyes from the road to the instrument panel, watching the ammeter needle, which jerked suspiciously, watching the oil gauge and the heat indicator. And his mind was cataloguing weak points and suspicious things about the car. He listened to the whine, which might be the rear end, dry; and he listened to tappets lifting and falling. He kept his hand on the gear lever, feeling the turning gears through it. And he had let the clutch out against the brake to test for slipping clutch plates. He might be a musking goat sometimes, but this was his responsibility, this truck, its running, and its maintenance. If something went wrong it would be his fault, and while no one would say it, everyone, and Al most of all, would know it was his fault. And so he felt it, watched it, and listened to it. And his face was serious and responsible. And everyone respected him and his responsibility. Even Pa, who was the leader, would hold a wrench and take orders from Al.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="罗莎夏两手摸摸肚子。“你还看不出，”她说着，满意地笑了笑，就走进屋里去了。傍晚很热，西方地平线上还闪射着光芒。也不用什么招呼，全家人就都聚集在卡车边上，于是家庭会议就开幕了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The film of evening light made the red earth lucent, so that its dimensions were deepened, so that a stone, a post, a building had greater depth and more solidity than in the daytime light; and these objects were curiously more individual -- a post was more essentially a post, set off from the earth it stood in and the field of corn it stood out against. And plants were individuals, not the mass of crop; and the ragged willow tree was itself, standing free of all other willow trees. The earth contributed a light to the evening. The front of the gray, paintless house, facing the west, was luminous as the moon is. The gray dusty truck, in the yard before the door, stood out magically in this light, in the overdrawn perspective of a stereopticon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="黄昏的余晖使红色的大地隐隐发亮，所以大地的周界显得深沉了，石头、柱子、房屋都比在白昼的光线里深沉得多、坚实得多；说也稀奇，这些物体都显得更加独特——柱子成了更实在的柱子，仿佛跟它所在的大地和它所衬托的玉米互相分离了似的。农作物也一株一株地各自成为个体，而不是一片庄稼了；那棵枝条纷乱的柳树也离开了其他所有的柳树，孤零零地站在那里。大地给黄昏贡献了一份微光。那所没有油漆的灰色房屋面朝西面，前面部分像月亮那样灿然有光。就在这片微光中，就在这片好像一架立体幻灯机放映的景象里，那辆蒙着尘沙的灰色卡车轮廓鲜明地耸立在门前的院子里，带着几分神奇的意味。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The family met at the most important place, near the truck. The house was dead, and the fields were dead; but this truck was the active thing, the living principle. The ancient Hudson, with bent and scarred radiator screen, with grease in dusty globules at the worn edges of every moving part, with hub caps gone and caps of red dust in their places -- this was the new hearth, the living center of the family; half passenger car and half truck, high-sided and clumsy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一家人在靠近卡车的那块最重要的地方聚会。房屋死气沉沉，田野也是死气沉沉；但是这辆卡车却是有生气的东西，是生命的主要因素。这辆老古董哈得逊车，水箱的隔板弯曲而有伤痕，一切能转动的机件上被磨损的棱角上都蒙着带灰尘的水珠，而水珠里都夹杂着肮脏的机油，气门盖都没有了，气门上面积着红色的尘沙——这辆又笨又大、一半客车一半卡车的高档板旧汽车，就是他们的新的家，一家的生活中心。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Pa walked around the truck, looking at it, and then he squatted down in the dust and found a stick to draw with. One foot was flat to the ground, the other rested on the ball and slightly back, so that one knee was higher than the other. Left forearm rested on the lower, left, knee; the right elbow on the right knee, and the right fist cupped for the chin. Pa squatted there, looking at the truck, his chin in his cupped fist. And Uncle John moved toward him and squatted down beside him. Their eyes were brooding. Grampa came out of the house and saw the two squatting together, and he jerked over and sat on the running board of the truck, facing them. That was the nucleus. Tom and Connie and Noah strolled in and squatted, and the line was a half-circle with Grampa in the opening. And then Ma came out of the house, and Granma with her, and Rose of Sharon behind, walking daintily. They took their places behind the squatting men; they stood up and put their hands on their hips. And the children, Ruthie and Winfield, hopped from foot to foot beside the women; the children squidged their toes in the red dust, but they made no sound. Only the preacher was not there. He, out of delicacy, was sitting on the ground behind the house. He was a good preacher and knew his people.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爸在卡车周围走了一转，把车子看了一番，然后蹲在尘土里，找了一支柴棒来写数字。他一只脚平踏在地上，一只脚踮着，略略向后，因此一个膝盖高于另一个膝盖。他的左前臂搁在较低的左膝上；右肘撑在右膝上，右手托住了下巴。爸就这样用拳头托着下巴，蹲在那里，望着卡车。约翰伯伯向他走去，在他旁边蹲下来。他们的眼睛露出沉思的神色。爷爷从屋里出来，看见他们两人蹲在那里，便颤巍巍地走过来，坐在卡车的踏板上，面对着他们。这就是全家的核心。汤姆、康尼和诺亚踱过来蹲着，这些人形成了一个半圆形，爷爷就在缺口的地方。接着，妈和奶奶也从屋里出来了，罗莎夏跟在后面，娇弱地走着。她们在蹲着的男人们背后就位；她们站在那里，把手按在屁股上。露西和温菲尔德两个孩子在妇女们身边蹦蹦跳跳；他们在尘沙里扭动着脚趾，可是不出一点响声。只有牧师不在那里。他是知趣的，就在屋后的地上坐着。他是个好牧师，懂得老乡们的心理。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The people too were changed in the evening, quieted. They seemed to be a part of an organization of the unconscious. They obeyed impulses which registered only faintly in their thinking minds. Their eyes were inward and quiet, and their eyes, too, were lucent in the evening, lucent in dusty faces.</div>

Stuck my finger in the differential and they wasn't no sawdust. Opened the gear box an' they wasn't no sawdust. Test' her clutch an' rolled her wheels for line. Went under her an' her frame ain't splayed none. She never been rolled. Seen they was a cracked cell in her battery an' made the fella put in a good one. The tires ain't worth a damn, but they're a good size. Easy to get. She'll ride like a bull calf, but she ain't shootin' no oil. Reason I says buy her is she was a pop'lar car. Wreckin' yards is full a Hudson Super-Sixes, an' you can buy parts cheap. Could a got a bigger, fancier car for the same money, but parts too hard to get, an' too dear.

The bureaus were sold. On the floor lay a broken comb, an empty talcum powder can, and a few dust mice. Ma set her lantern on the floor. She reached behind one of the boxes that had served as chairs and brought out a stationery box, old and soiled and cracked at the corners. She sat down and opened the box. Inside were letters, clippings, photographs, a pair of earrings, a little gold signet ring, and a watch chain braided of hair and tipped with gold swivels. She touched the letters with her fingers, touched them lightly, and she smoothed a newspaper clipping on which there was an account of Tom's trial. For a long time she held the box, looking over it, and her fingers disturbed the letters and then lined them up again. She bit her lower lip, thinking, remembering. And at last she made up her mind. She picked out the ring, the watch charm, the earrings, dug under the pile and found one gold cuff link. She took a letter from an envelope and dropped the trinkets in the envelope. She folded the envelope over and put it in her dress pocket. Then gently and tenderly she closed the box and smoothed the top carefully with her fingers. Her lips parted. And then she stood up, took her lantern, and went back into the kitchen. She lifted the stove lid and laid the box gently among the coals. Quickly the heat browned the paper.

<div class="line_en">"I forgot the dogs," Pa said. He whistled shrilly, and one bouncing dog ran in, but only one. Noah caught him and threw him up on the top, where he sat rigid and shivering at the height. "Got to leave the other two," Pa called. "Muley, will you look after 'em some? See they don't starve?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我把狗忘了，”爸说。他尖声吹了一下呼哨，一只狗就跳着跑过来，但是只有这一只。诺亚把它捉住了，抛到车顶上，它便端端正正地坐着，因为那地方太高，它直打哆嗦。“还有两只，只好甩下了，”爸大声说。“缪利，你可以照顾照顾它们，不让它们饿死吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Pa said, "Ma, you an' Granma set in with Al for a while. We'll change aroun' so it's easier, but you start out that way." They got into the cab, and then the rest swarmed up on top of the load, Connie and Rose of Sharon, Pa and Uncle John, Ruthie and Winfield, Tom and the preacher. Noah stood on the ground, looking up at the great load of them sitting on top of the truck.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爸说道：“妈，你和奶奶暂且在奥尔身边坐一会儿吧。我们轮流调换位子，可以舒畅些，你们先那么坐着吧。”她们跨进了驾驶座，其余的人便拥到行李上，康尼和罗莎夏，爸和约翰伯伯，露西和温菲尔德，还有汤姆和牧师。诺亚站在地上，抬头望着坐在满车行李上的那一大堆人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I got to get that ridge pole fixed," Al said. "Do her tonight when we stop." Grampa grunted and fought weakly against awakening, and when he was finally settled he went deeply to sleep again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我要把那根撑杆装好，”奥尔说，“等今天晚上我们停车的时候来装吧。”爷爷昏昏沉沉地咕噜着，有气无力地抗拒他们的干扰，不愿意醒过来。后来他们终于把他安顿妥当了的时候，他又呼呼地睡熟了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Al walked around, looking underneath at the springs. "Holy Jesus," he said, "them springs is flat as hell. Lucky I blocked under 'em."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="奥尔绕着卡车走了一圈，看看车底下的弹簧。“哎呀，”他说道，“这些弹簧钢板全压扁了。幸亏我在底下又垫了木块撑着。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Al slipped in the low gear and let in the clutch. The truck shuddered and strained across the yard. And the second gear took hold. They crawled up the little hill, and the red dust arose about them. "Chr-ist, what a load!" said Al. "We ain't makin' no time on this trip."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="奥尔把排挡一推，踩紧了离合器。卡车震动了一阵，吃力地穿过了院子。接着换上了二挡。他们爬上了那座小山冈，四周扬起了红色的尘土。“老天爷，装得多重啊！”奥尔说，“这一趟可跑不快。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“把那些鸡也拿去吧，”爸说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Al got into the driver's seat. The starter whirred and caught, and whirred again. And then the loose roar of the six cylinders and a blue smoke behind. "So long, Muley," Al called.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="奥尔坐上了司机座位。发动机转了一阵，煞住了，又转动起来。于是六个汽缸发出了轻松的吼声，车后面冒起了青烟。“再见，缪利，”奥尔喊道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The people on top of the load did look back. They saw the house and the barn and a little smoke still rising from the chimney. They saw the windows reddening under the first color of the sun. They saw Muley standing forlornly in the dooryard looking after them. And then the hill cut them off. The cotton fields lined the road. And the truck crawled slowly through the dust toward the highway and the west.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="行李上面的人都在向后望。他们看见了那所屋子和那个仓棚，烟囱上还微微冒出一缕炊烟。他们看见那些窗户映着太阳最初的色彩，渐渐红起来。他们看见缪利冷冷清清地站在门前的院子里，目送着他们。接着，山冈便截断了他们的视线。棉田排列在大路的两旁。卡车向着公路，向着西部，从尘沙中慢腾腾地开走了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ma tried to look back, but the body of the load cut off her view. She straightened her head and peered straight ahead along the dirt road. And a great weariness was in her eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="妈想要向背后望望，但是车上堆着的行李却挡住了她的视线。她挺着头，眯缝着眼睛，直望着前面那条土路。她的两眼中满是倦意。">查看中文翻译</div>
