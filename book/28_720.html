<div class="line_en">Motherhood became my motivator. It dictated my movements, my decisions, the rhythm of every day. It took no time, no thought at all, for me to be fully consumed by my new role as a mother. I'm a detail-oriented person, and a baby is nothing if not a reservoir of details. Barack and I studied little Malia, taking in the mystery of her rosebud lips, her dark fuzzy head and unfocused gaze, the herky-jerky way she moved her tiny limbs. We bathed and swaddled her and kept her pressed to our chests. We tracked her eating, her hours of sleep, her every gurgle. We analyzed the contents of each soiled diaper as if it might tell us all her secrets.</div>

<div class="line_en">She was a tiny person, a person entrusted to us. I was heady with the responsibility of it, fully in her thrall. I could lose an hour just watching her breathe. When there's a baby in the house, time stretches and contracts, abiding by none of the regular rules. A single day can feel endless, and then suddenly six months have blown right past. Barack and I laughed about what parenthood had done to us. If we'd once spent the dinner hour parsing the intricacies of the juvenile justice system, comparing what I'd learned during my stint at Public Allies with some of the ideas he was trying to fit into a reform bill in the legislature, we now, with no less fervor, debated whether Malia was too dependent on her pacifier and compared our respective methods for getting her to sleep. We were, as most new parents are, obsessive and a little boring, and nothing made us happier. We hauled little Malia in her baby carrier with us to Zinfandel for our Friday night dates, figuring out how to streamline our order so we could be in and out quickly, before she got too restless.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她是一个小人儿，一个被托付给我们的人。我满怀兴奋地照顾着她，对她着了迷。她睡觉时，我能一动不动地看她呼吸一个小时。家里有了孩子后，时间有时感觉很长，有时感觉又很短，不符合常规。短短一天会让人觉得那么漫长，然而，整整六个月又像一阵风一样很快就过去了。贝拉克和我对我们做了父母后的改变感到好笑。曾经，我们会在晚饭时分析错综复杂的青少年司法制度，讨论我在“公众联盟”工作期间了解到的情况和他计划提交给州议会的改革法案里的观点是否相契合；而现在，我们怀着同样的热情，讨论玛利亚是否对安抚奶嘴过于依赖，比较各自哄她入睡的方式。和大多数初为父母的人一样，我们有点强迫症，有点无聊，没有什么能让我们更开心。星期五晚上，我们用婴儿车推着玛利亚一起到仙粉黛餐厅约会，想办法缩短上菜时间，以便在她变得躁动不安之前，赶快吃完出去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">What I didn't realize -- and this would also go into my file of things many of us learn too late -- is that a part-time job, especially when it's meant to be a scaled-down version of your previously full-time job, can be something of a trap. Or at least that's how it played out for me. At work, I was still attending all the meetings I always had while also grappling with most of the same responsibilities. The only real difference was that I now made half my original salary and was trying to cram everything into a twenty-hour week. If a meeting ran late, I'd end up tearing home at breakneck speed to fetch Malia so that we could arrive on time (Malia eager and happy, me sweaty and hyperventilating) to the afternoon Wiggleworms class at a music studio on the North Side. To me, it felt like a sanity-warping double bind. I battled guilt when I had to take work calls at home. I battled a different sort of guilt when I sat at my office distracted by the idea that Malia might be allergic to peanuts. Part-time work was meant to give me more freedom, but mostly it left me feeling as if I were only half doing everything, that all the lines in my life had been blurred.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有件事我没有预料到，我觉得这也是很多人会后知后觉的一件事，那就是一份兼职工作，特别是当它是你此前所做全职工作的缩减版时，那会是一个陷阱，至少在我身上是这样的。上班时，我还是需要参加之前要参加的所有会议，工作量基本跟之前一样。唯一的不同是，我的薪水是过去的一半儿，却要在一周二十小时的工作时间里做完所有事。如果某次会议结束晚了，我就要以百米冲刺的速度奔回家，带玛利亚赶去北城一个音乐工作室上摇摆虫儿歌早教课（玛利亚快乐而兴奋，我则一身大汗、上气不接下气）。对我来说，那简直是要把人逼疯的节奏。在家里接工作电话时，我会有负疚感；同样，我坐在办公室里突然分心想到玛利亚可能会对花生过敏时，会有另一种负疚感。兼职工作原本是想给自己更多自由，结果后来我感觉负荷增加了一倍，我生活中所有的界限都一片模糊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Several months after Malia was born, I'd returned to work at the University of Chicago. I negotiated to come back only half-time, figuring this would be a win-win sort of arrangement -- that I could now be both career woman and perfect mother, striking the Mary Tyler Moore/ Marian Robinson balance I'd always hoped for. We'd found a babysitter, Glorina Casabal, a doting, expert caregiver about ten years older than I was. Born in the Philippines, she was trained as a nurse and had raised two kids of her own. Glorina --"Glo"-- was a short, bustling woman with a short, practical haircut and gold wire-rimmed glasses who could change a diaper in twelve seconds flat. She had a nurse's hyper-competent, do-anything energy and would become a vital and cherished member of our family for the next few years. Her most important quality was that she loved my baby passionately.</div>

<div class="line_en">Meanwhile, it seemed that Barack had hardly missed a stride. A few months after Malia's birth, he'd been reelected to a four-year term in the state senate, winning with 89 percent of the vote. He was popular and successful, and plate spinner that he was, he was also starting to think about bigger things -- namely, running for the U. S. Congress, hoping to unseat a four-term Democrat named Bobby Rush. Did I think it was a good idea for him to run for Congress? No, I did not. It struck me as unlikely that he'd win, given that Rush was well-known and Barack was still a virtual nobody. But he was a politician now and had traction inside the state Democratic Party. He had advisers and supporters, some of whom were urging him to give it a shot. Somebody had conducted a preliminary poll that seemed to suggest maybe he could win. And this I know for sure about my husband: You don't dangle an opportunity in front of him, something that could give him a wider field of impact, and expect him just to walk away. Because he doesn't. He won't.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="同一时间，贝拉克的事业似乎发展得顺风顺水。玛利亚出生几个月后，他再次被选入州参议院，赢得了百分之八十九的选票，任期四年。他很受欢迎，很成功，就像我前面说的，他是一个喜欢看着一堆盘子转起来的人，那时他又开始考虑更高的目标，那就是进入美国国会，希望取代一位连任四届的民主党人—鲍比·拉什。他竞选国会议员是个好主意吗？不，我不这么认为。我觉得他获胜的可能性不大，因为鲍比·拉什是个名人，而他基本上还是个无名小卒。但他是个从政者了，在州民主党内部有影响力。他有顾问和支持者，其中一些人力劝他试一试。有人做了一个初步的民意调查，结果显示他有获胜的可能。对我的丈夫，有一点我是了解的：你不能用机会去引诱他，如果那个机会可以让他在更广的范围内发挥影响力，那他绝不会坐视不理。因为他不是那样的人，以后也不会是。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At the end of 1999, when Malia was almost eighteen months old, we took her to Hawaii at Christmastime to visit her great-grandmother Toot, who was now seventy-seven years old and living in the same small high-rise apartment she'd been in for decades. It was meant to be a family visit -- the one time each year Toot could see her grandson and great-granddaughter. Winter had once again clapped itself over Chicago, siphoning the warmth from the air and the blue from the sky. Feeling antsy both at home and at work, we'd booked a modest hotel room near Waikiki Beach and started counting down the days. Barack's teaching duties at the law school had wrapped up for the semester, and I'd put in for time off at my job. But then politics got in the way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="1999年底，玛利亚快满十八个月的时候，我们在圣诞节带着她回到夏威夷，看望她的曾外祖母。贝拉克的外祖母当时已经七十七岁了，还住在那栋已经住了几十年的高楼里。那是探亲之行，每年只有那时候，外祖母才能见到自己的外孙和曾外孙女。冬天再次降临芝加哥，带走了空气中的暖意和天空中的湛蓝。我们在家和上班时都感到烦躁不安，在预订了威基基海滩附近的一家普通旅馆后，我们开始数着日子期待出发。贝拉克这一学期在法学院的课已经结束，我也把工作推后了。但是接下来，政治阻碍了我们的计划。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Illinois senate was hung up in a marathon debate, trying to settle on the provisions of a major crime bill. Instead of breaking for the holidays, it went into a special session with the aim of pushing through to a vote before Christmas. Barack called me from Springfield, saying we'd need to delay our trip by a few days. This wasn't great news, but I understood it was out of his hands. All I cared was that we eventually got there. I didn't want Toot spending Christmas alone, and beyond that Barack and I needed the downtime. The trip to Hawaii, I was figuring, would separate both of us from our work and give us a chance to simply breathe.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伊利诺伊州参议院正在进行一场马拉松式的漫长辩论，要落实一个很重要的打击犯罪法案的具体条款。那场辩论并没有因为假期而中断，参议院决定再加开一次会议，希望在圣诞节前敲定条款并提交表决。贝拉克从斯普林菲尔德打电话给我，说我们可能需要推迟几天再走。这不是个好消息，但我理解那是突发情况，不是他能控制的。我在乎的是，我们最后还是能赶上圣诞节，我不想让外祖母一个人过圣诞节，而且贝拉克和我都需要休假。我想，去夏威夷度假可以让我们抛开工作，放松一下。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I was enough of a veteran now to try to keep myself largely disengaged from the daily ups and downs of the race. I'd given Barack's decision to run a wan blessing, adopting a let's-just-get-this-out-of-the-way attitude about the whole thing. I thought maybe he'd try and fail to get into national politics and that this would then motivate him to want to try something entirely different. In an ideal world (my ideal world, anyway), Barack would do something like become the head of a foundation, where he could have an impact on issues that mattered and also make it home for dinner at night.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我那时是个经验丰富的老手了，基本不太在意他每天竞选活动的起起伏伏。我对贝拉克参选的决定并不热心，对整件事抱着一种尽快解决了事的态度。我想也许在进军国会受挫后，他会去尝试其他完全不同的事情。在理想的世界里（起码是在我的理想世界里），他会去做一家基金会的负责人，这样他不仅能在重要的事情上发挥影响力，而且晚上还能按时回家吃晚饭。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was now officially running for Congress, which meant that he rarely switched off. He would later give an interview to a local paper, estimating that during the six or so months he campaigned for Congress, he spent less than four full days at home with me and Malia. This was the painful reality of campaigning. On top of his other responsibilities, Barack lived with a ticking clock, one that incessantly reminded him of the minutes and hours remaining before the March primary. How he spent each of those minutes and hours could, at least in theory, affect the eventual outcome. What I was learning, too, was that in the eyes of a campaign operation, any minutes or hours a candidate spends privately with family are viewed basically as a waste of that valuable time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后来，他正式参选国会议员，这意味着他几乎没有休息时间。再后来，他接受一份本地报纸的采访时说，在他竞选国会议员的大约六个月的时间里，他待在家里陪我和玛利亚的时间加起来不超过四天。在众多的职责之外，贝拉克心里还装着一个时钟，时刻提醒他距离3月的初选还剩多少小时多少分钟，至少从理论上来说，他如何安排那些时间将会影响最终结果。我慢慢了解到，就选举活动而言，一位候选人选择和家人度过的每一小时和每一分钟，都被视为对那段宝贵时间的浪费。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">All was going fine until Barack got a call from someone back in Illinois, letting him know that the senate was somewhat abruptly going back into session to finish work on the crime bill. If he intended to vote, he had something like forty-eight hours to get back to Springfield. Another clock was now ticking. With a sinking heart, I watched as Barack jumped into action, rebooking our flights to leave the following day, pulling the plug on our vacation. We had to go. We had no choice. I suppose I could've stayed on alone with Malia, but what would be the fun in that? I wasn't happy with the idea of leaving, but I understood, again, this was the way of politics. The vote was an important one -- the bill included new gun-control measures, which Barack had fervently supported -- and it had also proven divisive enough that a single absent senator could potentially prevent the bill from passing. We were going home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一切都很顺利，直到贝拉克接到伊利诺伊州打来的一个电话，通知他参议院临时决定重新开会，完成那个打击犯罪法案的工作。如果他计划投票的话，那就还有48小时的时间赶回斯普林菲尔德。时钟又开始嘀嗒嘀嗒地响起来。我心情低落地看着贝拉克行动，把我们的航班改签到第二天，就这样结束了我们的假期。我们没有选择。我可以和玛利亚继续待在这里，但是那样有什么意思呢？我虽不愿意走，但是我再次表示理解，这就是政治。那次投票很重要，法案里增加了新的管控枪支的条款，是贝拉克强烈支持的，而议员们对法案的意见分歧很大，只要有一位参议员不到场投票，法案可能就无法通过。我们一定得回去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We flew to Hawaii on December 23, after the legislature finally hit pause for the holiday, though it still hadn't managed to find a resolution. But to my relief, we'd made it. Waikiki Beach was a revelation for young Malia. She tootled up and down the shoreline, kicking at the waves and exhausting herself with joy. We spent a merry, uneventful Christmas with Toot in her apartment, opening gifts and marveling at her devotion to the five-thousand-piece jigsaw puzzle she had going on a card table. As it always had, Oahu's languid green waters and cheery populace helped unhitch us from our everyday concerns, leaving us blissful and caught up in little more than the feeling of warm air on our skin and our daughter's delight at absolutely everything. As the headlines kept reminding us, we were fast approaching the dawn of a new millennium. And we were in a lovely place to spend the final days of 1999.</div>

<div class="line_en">But then something unexpected happened. Overnight, Malia spiked a high fever. She'd ended the day as an exuberant surf kicker but was now, not even twelve hours later, a hot and listless heap of toddler-shaped misery, glassy-eyed and wailing in pain, but still too young to tell us anything specific about it. We gave her Tylenol, but it didn't help much. She was tugging at one ear, which made me suspect it was infected. The reality of what this meant started to set in. We sat on the bed, watching Malia drift into a restless, uncomfortable sleep. We were only a matter of hours now from our flight home. I saw the worry deepening on Barack's face, caught as he was in the crosscurrents of his opposing obligations. What we were about to decide went far beyond the moment at hand.</div>

He could leave his sick daughter and fretting wife halfway across the Pacific and go join his colleagues. It was an option. But I wasn't going to martyr myself by suggesting it. I was vulnerable, I'll admit, swimming in the uncertainty of what was going on with Malia. What if the fever got worse? What if she needed a hospital? Meanwhile, around the world, there were more paranoid people than us readying fallout shelters, hoarding cash and jugs of water just in case the worst of the Y2K predictions came true and the power and communication grids went on the fritz due to buggy computer networks unable to register the new millennium.

<div class="line_en">Bobby Rush, the incumbent congressman, had tragically lost a family member to gun violence in Chicago only a few months earlier, which cast Barack in an even poorer light. Nobody seemed to register that he was from Hawaii, that he'd been visiting his widowed grandmother, or that his daughter had fallen ill. All that mattered was the vote. The press hammered on it for weeks. The Chicago Tribune's editorial page criticized the group of senators who hadn't managed to vote that day, calling them "a bunch of gutless sheep." Barack's other opponent, a fellow state senator named Donne Trotter, took his own shots, telling a reporter that "to use your child as an excuse for not going to work also shows poorly on the individual's character."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="鲍比·拉什，那位时任国会议员，几个月前刚刚在一次枪支暴力事件中失去一位亲人，这让贝拉克的形象变得更糟。似乎没有人注意到夏威夷是他的家乡，他回去是看望他孀居的外祖母，没赶回来是因为他的女儿生病。最重要的事情就是投票。媒体连续几周都在大力报道这件事。《芝加哥论坛报》的社论版批评那天没有到场投票的议员，称他们为“一帮没胆的绵羊”。贝拉克的另一个对手，一个叫多恩·特洛特的州议员对他进行攻击，告诉记者说“拿自己孩子当借口不来工作的人，其人品可想而知”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I wasn't accustomed to any of this. I wasn't used to having opponents or seeing my family life scrutinized in the news. Never before had I heard my husband's character questioned like that. It hurt to think that a good decision -- the right decision, as far as I was concerned -- seemed to be costing him so much. In a column he wrote for our neighborhood's weekly newspaper, Barack calmly defended his choice to stay with me and Malia in Hawaii.

<div class="line_en">It seemed that with the fickleness of a child's earache, Barack's three years of work in the state senate had been all but wiped away. He'd led an overhaul of state campaign finance laws that ushered in stricter ethics rules for elected officials. He'd fought for tax cuts and credits for the working poor and was focused on cutting prescription drug costs for senior citizens. He'd earned the trust of legislators from all parts of the state, Republican and Democrat alike. But none of the real stuff seemed to matter now. The race had devolved into a series of low blows.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就这样，因为孩子一时耳痛，贝拉克在州参议院三年的工作似乎被一笔勾销了。他曾经领导对州竞选经费法案的全面修订，从而加强了对当选官员的道德约束。他曾为帮助穷人减税和贷款而抗争，曾致力于减少老年人处方药的费用。他赢得了来自伊利诺伊州各地的议员的信任，不管是共和党还是民主党。但这些似乎都无关紧要了。竞选已经演变成了一系列卑劣的勾当。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">From the start of the campaign, Barack's opponents and their supporters had been propagating unseemly ideas meant to gin up fear and mistrust among African American voters, suggesting that Barack was part of an agenda cooked up by the white residents of Hyde Park -- read, white Jews -- to foist their preferred candidate on the South Side. "Barack is viewed in part to be the white man in blackface in our community," Donne Trotter told the Chicago Reader. Speaking to the same publication, Bobby Rush said, "He went to Harvard and became an educated fool. We're not impressed with these folks with these eastern elite degrees." He's not one of us, in other words. Barack wasn't a real black man, like them -- someone who spoke like that, looked like that, and read that many books could never be.</div>

<div class="line_en">Barack, for his part, took it more in stride than I did, having already seen in Springfield how nasty politics could get and how the truth was so often distorted to serve people's political aims. Bruised but unwilling to give up, he continued to campaign through the winter, making his weekly trips back and forth to Springfield while trying earnestly to beat back the storm, even as donations began to dwindle and more and more endorsements went to Bobby Rush. With the clock ticking down to the primary, Malia and I hardly saw him at all, though he called us every evening to say good night.</div>

He was everything people like Bobby Rush and Jesse Jackson and so many black leaders had talked about for years: He'd gotten an education, and rather than abandoning the African American community, he was now trying to serve it. This was a heated election, sure, but Barack was being attacked for all the wrong things. I was astonished to see how our leaders treated him only as a threat to their power, inciting mistrust by playing on backward, anti-intellectual ideas about race and class.</div>

<div class="line_en">My stint at the university had left me feeling worn out, putting me in a far-from-perfect juggle while also straining our finances with the expense of child care. After Sasha was born, I debated whether I even wanted to return to my job at all, thinking that maybe our family would be better served if I stayed home full-time. Glo, our beloved babysitter, had been offered a higher-paying nursing job and had reluctantly decided she needed to move on. I couldn't blame her, of course, but losing Glo rearranged everything in my working mother's heart. Her investment in my family had allowed me to maintain my investment in my job. She loved our kids as if they were her own. I'd wept and wept the night she gave her notice, knowing how hard it would be for us to balance without her. I knew how fortunate we were to have the resources to hire her in the first place. But now that she was gone, it felt like losing an arm.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sasha, we planned to call her. I'd chosen the name because I thought it had a sassy ring. A girl named Sasha would brook no fools.

My hope was that they'd grow up to be bright and energetic, optimistic like their father and hard-driving like their mom. More than anything, I wanted them to be strong, to have a certain steeliness, the kind that would keep them upright and forward moving, no matter what. I didn't know a thing about what was coming our way, how our family's life would unfold -- whether everything would go well or everything would go poorly, or whether, like most people, we'd get a solid mix of both.

<div class="line_en">I loved being with my little daughters. I recognized the value of every minute and hour put in at home, especially with Barack's schedule being so irregular. I thought once again of my mother's decision to stay home with me and Craig. Surely, I was guilty of romanticizing her life -- imagining it had actually been fun for her to Pine-Sol the windowsills and make all our clothes -- but compared with the way I'd been living, it seemed quaint and manageable, and possibly worth trying. I liked the idea of being in charge of one thing rather than two, of not having my brain scrambled by the competing narratives of home and work. And it did seem that we could swing it financially. Barack had moved from an adjunct position to a senior lecturer at the law school, which gave us a tuition break at the university's Lab School, where Malia was soon to start preschool.</div>

<div class="line_en">I debated whether to even send in my résumé. It sounded like a great opportunity, but I'd just basically talked myself into the idea that I was -- that we all were -- better off with my staying home. In any event, this was not a moment of high glamour for me, not a time I could really imagine blow-drying my hair and putting on a business suit. I was up several times a night to nurse Sasha, which put me behind on sleep and therefore sanity. Even as I was still rather fanatically devoted to neatness, I was losing the battle. Our condo was strewn with baby toys, toddler books, and packages of diaper wipes. Any trip outside the house involved a giant stroller and an unfashionable diaper bag full of the essentials: a Ziploc of Cheerios, a few everyday toys, and an extra change of clothes -- for everyone.</div>

<div class="line_en">But motherhood had also brought with it a set of wonderful friendships. I'd managed to connect with a group of professional women and form a kind of chatty, hands-on social cluster. Most of us were deep into our thirties and working in all sorts of careers, from banking and government to nonprofits. Many of us were having children at the same time. The more children we had, the tighter we grew. We saw one another nearly every weekend. We looked after each other's babies, went on group outings to the zoo, and bought bulk tickets for Disney on Ice. Sometimes on a Saturday afternoon, we just set the whole pack of kids loose in somebody's playroom and cracked open a bottle of wine.</div>

Some allowed their toddlers to eat hot dogs and corn chips; others served whole-grain everything. A few had super-involved husbands; others had husbands like mine, who were oversubscribed and away a lot.

There was a war going on in Afghanistan, a new color-coded threat advisory system being used in the United States, and Osama bin Laden was apparently hiding somewhere in a cave.

C. and more because five years into his tenure as state senator Barack's overloaded schedule was starting to really grate on me. As Sasha and Malia grew, I found that the pace only quickened and the to-do lists only got longer, leaving me operating in what felt like a never-ending state of overdrive. Barack and I did all we could to keep the girls' lives calm and manageable. We had a new babysitter helping out at home. Malia was happy at her University of Chicago Laboratory School, making friends and loading up her own little calendar with birthday parties and swim classes on weekends. Sasha was now about a year old, wobbling on two feet and beginning to say words and crack us up with her megawatt smiles.

<div class="line_en">And then I'd wait. I'd wait so long that Sasha's and Malia's eyelids would start to droop and I'd have to carry them to bed. Or I'd wait alone, hungry, and increasingly bitter as my own eyes got heavy and candle wax pooled on the table. On my way, I was learning, was the product of Barack's eternal optimism, an indication of his eagerness to be home that did nothing to signify when he would actually arrive. Almost home was not a geo-locator but rather a state of mind. Sometimes he was on his way but needed to stop in to have one last forty-five-minute conversation with a colleague before he got into the car. Other times, he was almost home but forgot to mention that he was first going to fit in a quick workout at the gym.</div>

<div class="line_en">This left me a little ragged in the evenings and sometimes put me in direct conflict with my night-owl husband, who turned up on Thursday nights from Springfield relatively chipper and wanting to dive headfirst into family life, making up for all the time he'd lost. But time was now officially an issue for us. If Barack's disregard for punctuality had once been something I'd gently teased him about, it was now a straight-up aggravation. I knew that Thursdays made him happy. I'd hear his excitement when he called to report that he was done with work and finally headed home. I understood it was nothing but good intentions that would lead him to say "I'm on my way!" or "Almost home!" And for a while, I believed those words. I'd give the girls their nightly bath but delay bedtime so that they could wait up to give their dad a hug. Or I'd feed them dinner and put them to bed but hold off on eating myself, lighting a few candles and looking forward to sharing a meal with Barack.</div>

<div class="line_en">We live by the paradigms we know. In Barack's childhood, his father disappeared and his mother came and went. She was devoted to him but never tethered to him, and as far as he was concerned, there was nothing wrong in this approach. He'd had hills, beaches, and his own mind to keep him company. Independence mattered in Barack's world. It always had and always would. I, meanwhile, had been raised inside the tight weave of my own family, in our boxed-in apartment, in our boxed-in South Side neighborhood, with my grandparents and aunts and uncles all around, everyone jammed at one table for our regular Sunday night meals. After thirteen years in love, we needed to think through what this meant.</div>

<div class="line_en">When it came down to it, I felt vulnerable when he was away. Not because he wasn't fully devoted to our marriage -- this is and has always been a meaningful certainty in my life -- but because having been brought up in a family where everyone always showed up, I could be extra let down when someone didn't show. I was prone to loneliness and now also felt fierce about sticking up for the girls' needs, too. We wanted him close. We missed him when he was gone. I worried that he didn't understand what that felt like for us. I feared that the path he'd chosen for himself -- and still seemed so clearly committed to pursuing -- would end up steamrolling our every need. When he'd first approached me about running for state senate years earlier, there had been only two of us to think about. I had no conception of what saying yes to politics might mean for us later, once we'd added two children to the mix. But I now knew enough to understand that politics was never especially kind to families. I'd had a glimpse of it back in high school, through my friendship with Santita Jackson, and had seen it again when Barack's political opponents had exploited his decision to stay with Malia in Hawaii when she was sick.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说到底，没有他的陪伴我感到脆弱无助。不是因为他对我们的婚姻不够投入—这一点我向来是确定无疑的，而是因为我从小在一个所有人都在场的家庭里长大，当有人缺席时我会感到非常失落。我容易觉得孤独，加上还要照顾女儿们的需求，又感到愤怒。我们想要他在身边。他不在的时候我们会想念他。我担心他不理解我们的感受。我害怕他为自己选择的道路—而且很明显他依然想在那条路上走下去—最终会压倒我们的每一个需求。在他几年前第一次问我对于他竞选州参议院席位的想法时，需要考虑的还只有我们两个人。等我们有了两个孩子，我才知道答应他从政对我们意味着什么。我当时有了足够的阅历，知道政治对家庭向来不友好。早在高中时，我和桑蒂塔的友谊就让我看到了这一点；后来在贝拉克的政治对手攻击他留在夏威夷陪生病的玛利亚时，我再次看到了这一点。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Barack was reluctant at first to try couples counseling. He was accustomed to throwing his mind at complicated problems and reasoning them out on his own. Sitting down in front of a stranger struck him as uncomfortable, if not a tad dramatic. Couldn't he just run over to Borders and buy some relationship books? Weren't there discussions we could have on our own? But I wanted to really talk, and to really listen, and not to do it late at night or during hours we could be together with the girls. The few people I knew who'd tried couples counseling and were open enough to talk about it said that it had done them some good. And so I booked us an appointment with a downtown psychologist who came recommended by a friend, and Barack and I went to see him a handful of times.</div>

I'd had close friends go through devastating breakups, brought on by small problems left unattended or lapses in communication that led eventually to irreparable rifts. A couple of years earlier, my brother, Craig, had moved temporarily back into the upstairs apartment we'd grown up in, living above our mother after his own marriage had slowly and painfully fallen apart.</div>

<div class="line_en">Our counselor -- Dr. Woodchurch, let's call him -- was a soft-spoken white man who'd gone to good universities and always wore khakis. My assumption was that he would hear what Barack and I had to say and then instantly validate all my grievances. Because every last one of those grievances was, as I saw it, absolutely valid. I'm going to guess that Barack might have felt the same way about his own grievances.</div>

<div class="line_en">I began to see that there were ways I could be happier and that they didn't necessarily need to come from Barack's quitting politics in order to take some nine-to-six foundation job. (If anything, our counseling sessions had shown me that this was an unrealistic expectation.) I began to see how I'd been stoking the most negative parts of myself, caught up in the notion that everything was unfair and then assiduously, like a Harvard-trained lawyer, collecting evidence to feed that hypothesis. I now tried out a new hypothesis: It was possible that I was more in charge of my happiness than I was allowing myself to be. I was too busy resenting Barack for managing to fit workouts into his schedule, for example, to even begin figuring out how to exercise regularly myself. I spent so much energy stewing over whether or not he'd make it home for dinner that dinners, with or without him, were no longer fun.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我渐渐意识到，我有办法让自己更开心，不必非要贝拉克退出政界转做某个朝九晚六的基金会的工作。（我们的几次心理咨询也让我看到那是不现实的期望。）我发现，我一直在给自己最消极的部分火上浇油，觉得一切都不公平，然后像一个哈佛大学培养的律师一样，千方百计地搜寻证据来支持这一假想。我开始尝试新的假想：也许我可以比以往做更多事情，让自己开心起来。我忙于责怪贝拉克把健身这一项加进他的日程表里，而根本没想我自己如何定时健身。我耗费了太多精力，为他能否赶回家吃晚饭而烦恼，结果不管他在与不在，晚饭本身已经不再有趣。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This turned out to be the big revelation for me about counseling: No validating went on. No sides were taken. When it came to our disagreements, Dr. Woodchurch would never be the deciding vote. Instead, he was an empathic and patient listener, coaxing each of us through the maze of our feelings, separating out our weapons from our wounds. He cautioned us when we got too lawyerly and posited careful questions intended to get us to think hard about why we felt the way we felt. Slowly, over hours of talking, the knot began to loosen. Each time Barack and I left his office, we felt a bit more connected.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而最后，我对咨询这件事有了一个大发现：中间没有认定，没有偏袒。在我们看法不统一时，伍德丘奇医生从不会投票支持任何一方。他是一个有同理心和耐心的聆听者，小心地引领着我们通过自己感觉的迷宫，把我们的武器和我们的伤口分开。当我们像律师一样辩论时他会提醒我们，并精心设定一些问题，引导我们思考为什么自己会有那样的感觉。慢慢地，经过几个小时的谈话，那个结解开了。每次贝拉克和我离开他的办公室时，我们都感觉离彼此更近了一些。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This was my pivot point, my moment of self-arrest. Like a climber about to slip off an icy peak, I drove my ax into the ground. That isn't to say that Barack didn't make his own adjustments -- counseling helped him to see the gaps in how we communicated, and he worked to be better at it -- but I made mine, and they helped me, which then helped us. For starters, I recommitted myself to being healthy. Barack and I belonged to the same gym, run by a jovial and motivating athletic trainer named Cornell McClellan. I'd worked out with Cornell for a couple of years, but having children had changed my regular routine. My fix for this came in the form of my ever-giving mother, who still worked full-time but volunteered to start coming over to our house at 4:45 in the morning several days a week so that I could run out to Cornell's and join a girlfriend for a 5:00 a. m. workout and then be home by 6:30 to get the girls up and ready for their days. This new regimen changed everything: Calmness and strength, two things I feared I was losing, were now back.</div>

<div class="line_en">When it came to the home-for-dinner dilemma, I installed new boundaries, ones that worked better for me and the girls. We made our schedule and stuck to it. Dinner each night was at 6:30. Baths were at 7:00, followed by books, cuddling, and lights-out at 8:00 sharp. The routine was ironclad, which put the weight of responsibility on Barack to either make it on time or not. For me, this made so much more sense than holding off dinner or having the girls wait up sleepily for a hug. It went back to my wishes for them to grow up strong and centered and also unaccommodating to any form of old-school patriarchy: I didn't want them ever to believe that life began when the man of the house arrived home. We didn't wait for Dad. It was his job now to catch up with us.</div>
