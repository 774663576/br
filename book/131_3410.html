<div class="line_en">A few months earlier, a different illicit romance had been brewing. To Nath's immense disapproval, all spring Lydia had spent her afternoons out with Jack in his car: driving round and round town, or parking the VW near the green quad of the college, or by the playground, or in a deserted parking lot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几个月前，另一场地下恋情也在酝酿之中。尽管内斯强烈反对，整个春天，莉迪亚每天下午还是会和杰克开车出去，围着镇子兜风，或者把甲壳虫停在大学校园外面、操场旁边和某个废弃的停车场里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Despite what Nath thought, to Lydia's smug satisfaction, despite the whispers, now and then, when someone glimpsed her climbing into Jack's car -- She's not, is she? No way. Her? Can't be -- despite Lydia's own expectations, the truth was much less scandalous. While the college students scurried to class, or kindergartners scaled the slide, or bowlers trudged into the alley for a quick after-work game, something happened that Lydia had never expected: she and Jack talked. As they sat smoking, feet propped on the dashboard, she told him stories about her parents: how in second grade, she'd traced the diagram of the heart from the encyclopedia, labeling each ventricle with magic marker, and her mother had pinned it up on her bedroom wall as if it were a masterpiece. How at ten, her mother had taught her to take a pulse; how at twelve her mother had persuaded her to skip Cat Malone's birthday party -- the only one she'd ever been invited to -- to finish her science fair project. How her father had insisted she go to the freshman dance and bought her a dress, and she had spent the night standing in the darkest corner of the gym, counting the minutes until she could go home: how late was late enough? Eight thirty? Nine? At first she tried not to mention Nath, remembering how Jack hated him. But she could not talk about herself without Nath and, to her surprise, Jack asked questions: Why did Nath want to be an astronaut? Was he quiet at home like he was at school? So she told him how, after the moon landing, he had bounded across the lawn, pretending to be Neil Armstrong, for days. How, in the sixth grade, he'd convinced the librarian to let him borrow from the adults' section and brought home textbooks on physics, flight mechanics, aerodynamics. How he'd asked for a telescope for his fourteenth birthday and received a clock radio instead; how he'd saved his allowance and bought himself one. How, sometimes, at dinner, Nath never said a word about his day, because their parents never asked. Jack absorbed everything, lighting her next cigarette as she flicked the old butt out the window, tossing her his pack when she ran out. Week after week, she tamped down a flare of guilt at making Nath seem even more pathetic -- because talking about Nath kept her in Jack's car every afternoon, and every afternoon she spent in Jack's car bothered Nath more and more.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Try again," Jack said. He set his foot on the dashboard and pushed in the cigarette lighter. "Nice and slow. Clutch in, gas out."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“再试一次，”杰克说着，朝仪表盘伸出一只脚，把点烟器踢进去，“轻点，慢点，抬离合，踩油门。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Think of the gas pedal and the clutch as partners," he said. "When one goes up, the other goes down." Under Jack's direction, Lydia let the clutch out slowly and tapped the gas with her toe, and the VW crept forward across the empty parking lot of the roller rink on Route 17. Then the engine stalled, slamming her shoulders into the seat back. Even after a week of practice, the violence of this moment still surprised her, how the whole car jolted and fell silent, as if it had had a heart attack.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“把油门和离合器想象成一对好伙伴，”杰克说，“一个踏板抬起来，另一个必然是落下的。”在杰克的指导下，莉迪亚缓缓松开离合器踏板，脚尖轻点油门，操纵着甲壳虫汽车慢慢穿过17号公路旱冰场旁边那座空旷的停车场。然后，发动机熄火了，她的肩膀一下子撞在靠背上。尽管已经练习了一星期，这种突如其来的事件还是会让她觉得意外。整辆车先是摇摇晃晃，然后静止不动，像心脏病发作一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now, in mid-April, Jack had started teaching Lydia to drive. At the end of the month, she would be sixteen.</div>

<div class="line_en">At the far end of the parking lot, a police car pulled in and executed a neat U-turn, pointing its nose toward the street. They're not looking for us, Lydia told herself. Route 17, out at the edge of town, was a notorious speed trap. Still, the black-and-white car kept catching her eye. She turned the key and restarted the car and stalled again, almost at once.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="停车场的另一侧，一辆警车开进来，利落地掉了个头，车头对准了街面。“他们不是来找我们的。”莉迪亚告诉自己。17号公路在镇子边上，是臭名昭著的汽车超速监视区。然而，黑白相间的警车还是令她走神。她转动钥匙，重新发动汽车，这一次，发动机几乎立刻就熄火了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She had not realized this, but it was true. Even the two weeks until her birthday, when she could get her learner's permit, seemed eternal. When she had her license, Lydia thought, she could go anywhere. She could drive across town, across Ohio, all the way to California, if she wanted to. Even with Nath gone -- her mind shied from the thought -- she would not be trapped alone with her parents; she could escape anytime she chose. Just thinking about it made her legs twitch, as if itching to run.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她没有意识到这个问题，但他说得对。还有两个星期就是她的生日，却不知道什么时候能取得初学者驾照。等获得驾照，莉迪亚想，她就能去任何地方。如果她愿意，大可以离开米德伍德，横穿俄亥俄，一路驶向加利福尼亚。就算内斯离开了——她不愿想到这件事——她也不会孤零零地困在父母身边；她可以在自己选定的时间逃离。只是想到这些，她的腿就激动得打战，仿佛迫不及待想要逃跑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Slowly, she thought, taking a deep breath. Just like partners. One goes up, the other goes down. James had promised to teach her to drive their sedan as soon as she had her permit, but Lydia did not want to learn in their car. It was sedate and docile, like a middle-aged mare. It buzzed gently, like a watchful chaperone, if you didn't fasten your seat belt. "After you get your license," her father said, "we'll let you take the car out on Friday nights with your friends."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="慢点，她想，随后做了个深呼吸。它们是一对好伙伴。一个抬起，一个落下。詹姆斯保证过，只要她拿到初学者驾照，他就教她开他们家的轿车，但莉迪亚不想用家里的车学，那辆车太安静，太温驯，犹如一匹中年母马，如果你没有系安全带，它会温柔地嗡嗡叫，俨然一副警惕的监护人的架势。“等你得到初学者驾照，”她父亲说，“我们就让你星期五晚上开车和朋友出去。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Lydia sank the clutch to the floor and started the engine again and reached for the gearshift. It was almost five thirty, and her mother would expect her soon. When she tried to let out the clutch, her foot slipped off the pedal. The car bucked and died. The eyes of the policeman in the cruiser flicked toward them, then back toward the road.</div>

<div class="line_en">Lydia knew this was a lie, but she nodded. "Yeah," she said hoarsely. "Next time." As they turned onto Route 17, she blew a long column of smoke out toward the police car.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jack shook his head. "We can try again tomorrow." The coils of the lighter glowed as he pulled it from the socket and pressed a cigarette to its center, the end singeing black against the hot metal, then orange, as if the color had bled. He passed it to Lydia and, once they had switched seats, lit another for himself. "You almost had it," he said, wheeling the car toward the exit of the parking lot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰克摇摇头。“我们明天再试。”他把点烟器拔出插座，上面的线圈闪闪发光，杰克把一根烟凑到点烟器中间，在金属的炙烤下，烟头先是焦黑，然后变红，仿佛血的颜色。他把烟递给莉迪亚，和她对调位置，然后，又给自己点了一支烟。“你差不多就要学会了。”他说完，驾驶着汽车向停车场的出口驶去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She hopped out a block early, and Jack turned the corner and pulled into his driveway while she trotted home, as if she'd walked the whole way herself. Tomorrow, she thought, she would pop the car into first and they would roll across the parking lot, white lines whipping beneath the wheels. On top of the pedals, her feet would feel comfortable, her insteps supple. Soon she would glide down the highway, shifting into third, then fourth, speeding off somewhere all on her own.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她在离家一个街区的地方提前下车，杰克转了个弯，驶向他家的车道，莉迪亚小跑着回家，假装刚才一直都在步行。明天，她想，她会挂到一挡，穿过停车场，碾过地上的白线。她的脚踩在踏板上会十分舒适自如，脚背也不再僵硬，接着，她就开上公路，挂上三挡，然后四挡，加速驶向某个地方，完全凭她一个人的力量。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now, Lydia said, "He would never believe me."</div>

<div class="line_en">Lydia grinned. She suspected that Jack still took other girls out -- some days, he and the VW were nowhere to be found -- but with her, he was practically gentlemanly: he had never even held her hand. So what, if they were only friends? Most days she was the one climbing into his car, and she knew this had not escaped Nath's attention. At dinnertime, while she spun stories for her mother about her grades and her extra credit project, or for her father about Shelley's new perm or Pam's obsession with David Cassidy, Nath watched her -- half-angry, half-afraid -- as if he wanted to say something but didn't know how. She knew what he was thinking, and she let him. Some evenings, she came into Nath's room, plopped down on his windowsill, and lit a smoke, daring him to say something.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莉迪亚笑了。她怀疑杰克仍然会带其他女孩出去鬼混——有时候，他和他的车都会不见踪影——不过，和她在一起的时候，他表现得一直像个绅士，他甚至连她的手都没拉过。那么，他们只是朋友吗？大部分的时间，只有她进出杰克的车，她知道，这逃不过内斯的眼睛。饭桌上，当她给母亲编造一些关于她的成绩的故事和所谓的“额外学分计划”，或者告诉父亲谢莉新烫了头发、帕姆爱上了大卫·卡西迪的时候，内斯都会看着她，既愤怒又担忧。他似乎想要说些什么，但不知如何开口。她知道他在想什么，也不阻止他去想。有几个晚上，她会走进内斯的房间，一屁股坐在窗台上，点燃一支烟，等着他说点什么。">查看中文翻译</div>

At home, in her room, Lydia flicked on the record player, where the album Hannah had given her for Christmas was already in place -- to Lydia's surprise, she had been playing it over and over.

<div class="line_en">She meant: I love you. I love you. But her words sucked the breath from Lydia's lungs: When I'm dead. All through that long-ago summer, she had thought her mother might really be dead, and those weeks and months had left a persistent, insistent ache in her chest, like a pulsing bruise. She had promised: anything her mother wanted. Anything at all. As long as her mother stayed.</div>

<div class="line_en">All through dinner, the conversation with her mother writhed inside Lydia. She steeled herself with one thought: later, she would tell Nath all about it, and then she would feel better. She excused herself early, leaving half her plate untouched. "I've got to finish my physics," she said, knowing her mother wouldn't protest. Then, on her way upstairs, she passed the hall table, where her father had set the mail just before supper, and one envelope caught her eye: a Harvard seal in the corner, and beneath that, Admissions Office. She slit it open with her finger.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吃饭时与母亲的谈话令莉迪亚坐立不安。她只能安慰自己：过一会儿我要和内斯谈谈，这样就会感觉好些。她提前离开饭桌，盘子里的菜还剩一半没有动。“我去写物理作业了。”她知道，这样说的话，母亲不会反对。她经过前厅的桌子，晚饭前，她父亲刚把信件拿进来放在上面，一只信封吸引了她的注意：它的角上印着哈佛大学的校徽，校徽下面是“招生办”字样。她用手指划开信封。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dear Mr. Lee, she read. We look forward to you joining us on campus April 29-May 2 and have matched you with a host student for your visit. She knew it had been coming, but it had not seemed real until now. The day after her birthday. Without thinking, she ripped the letter and envelope in two. And at that moment, Nath came out of the kitchen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="亲爱的李先生，她读道，我们期待你于4月29日到5月2日访问我校，我们已为你安排好一位学生予以接待。虽然她知道这一天迟早要来，但白纸黑字带来的冲击异常真实。那是她生日的后一天。她不假思索地把信和信封撕成两半，就在这时，内斯走出厨房。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Thought I heard you out here," he said. "Can I borrow --" He spotted the red crest on the torn envelope, the letter in pieces in Lydia's hand, and froze.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我听见你在这里，”他说，“我能借……”看到莉迪亚手中破信封上的红色校徽和被撕碎的信，内斯呆住了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“给我。”内斯抢过了信，“这是我的，天哪。你在干什么？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Nath pieced the ragged edges together, as if he could make the letter whole again. "This is about my visit. What the hell were you thinking? That if I didn't get this, I couldn't go?" Put so starkly, it sounded foolish and pathetic, and tears began to form in the corners of Lydia's eyes, but Nath did not care. It was as if Lydia had been stealing from him. "Get it through your head: I'm going. I'm going that weekend. And I'm going in September." He bolted for the stairs. "Jesus Christ. I can't get out of this house fast enough." In a moment, his door slammed overhead, and although Lydia knew he wouldn't open it -- nor did she know what she would say if he did -- this did not stop her from knocking, again and again and again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="内斯小心地把碎片拼到一起，好像这样就能让信恢复原样似的。“这是关于我的参观的，你到底是怎么想的？要是我看不到它，就不能去吗？”他说得非常直白，听起来既愚蠢又可悲，眼泪涌出莉迪亚的眼角，但内斯不在乎，他觉得莉迪亚偷了他的东西，“你得想明白，我要走了。那个周末我会走，九月份更要走。”他跑上楼梯，“天哪，我恨不得快点离开这个家。”过了一会儿，他的房门“砰”的一声被甩上了。莉迪亚虽然知道他不会再开门——她也不知道他开了门她又能说什么——她还是过去敲门，一遍一遍又一遍。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I know what to do," Lydia said. "I just can't do it." Her hand had cramped into a claw around the gearshift and she pried it away. Partners, she reminded herself. The gas and the clutch were partners. It struck her now: that wasn't true. If one went up, the other had to go down. That was how everything went. Her grade in physics had gone up to a C-minus but her grade in history had slipped to a D. Tomorrow her English essay was due -- two thousand words on Faulkner -- but she could not even find her book. Maybe there was no such thing as partners, she thought. From all her studying, this flashed through her mind: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. One went up and the other went down. One gained, the other lost. One escaped, the other was trapped, forever.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我知道该怎么做，”莉迪亚说，“我只是做不到。”她紧抓变速杆，把它拨到一边。“好伙伴”，她提醒自己，油门和离合器是好伙伴。突然，她发现，这不是真的，如果一个上去，另一个就得下来，那算什么好伙伴。然而，世界上的事情都是这样的，她的物理成绩提升到C—，但历史成绩就得下降到D。明天又要交英语论文——两千字，论福克纳——但她连福克纳的书都找不着了。也许世上根本没有所谓的好伙伴，她想。她曾经学过的一条知识划过脑海：“对于每一个作用力，都有一个大小相等、方向相反的反作用力。”一个向上，另一个向下。一个得到，另一个失去。一个逃离，另一个受困，永远受困。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The thought haunted her for days. Although Nath -- cooled down now from the incident of the letter -- was speaking to her again, she could not bear to mention it, even to apologize. Each night after dinner, despite her mother's most pointed nagging, she stayed in her room alone instead of tiptoeing down the hall in search of sympathy. The night before her birthday, James rapped at her door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些想法侵扰了她好几天。虽然内斯——他已经从撕信事件中冷静下来——又和她说话了，但她还是不愿面对他要走的事实，甚至连向他道歉都不肯。尽管每天晚饭时还要继续听母亲唠叨，但她一离开饭桌就会躲进自己房间，而不是偷偷走进客厅寻找安慰。她生日的前一天晚上，詹姆斯过来敲门。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Lydia flipped the locket open and froze. Inside were two pictures the size of her thumbnail: one of her father, one of her -- dolled up for the ninth-grade dance the year before. All the way home, she had told him what a wonderful time she'd had. The photo of her father smiled broadly, fondly, expectantly. The photo of herself looked away, serious, resentful, sullen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莉迪亚打开挂坠，呆住了，里面有两张她拇指指甲那么小的照片：一张是她父亲，另一张是她——这是去年她盛装打扮参加九年级的舞会时照的。当时，在回家的路上，她不停地告诉父亲舞会是多么精彩。她父亲在照片上笑得很开心，带着天真和期盼的神情。她自己的照片则很严肃，面带愠色，眼睛也没有看镜头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You've seemed down the past couple of weeks," he said. He held out a little blue velvet box the size of a deck of cards. "I thought an early present might cheer you up." It had taken him some time, this gift, and he was proud of it. He had gone so far as to ask Louisa for advice on what a teenage girl might like, and this time, he was sure Lydia would love it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“最近几周你看上去心情不好，”他说，然后拿出一只蓝色的丝绒小盒，盒面像扑克牌那么大，“我想，提前把礼物送给你可能会让你开心。”詹姆斯觉得自豪，因为自己为这份礼物花了一番心思。他征求过路易莎的建议，问她十几岁的小女孩可能喜欢什么样的东西，所以这一次，他相信莉迪亚会喜欢它。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Inside the box lay a silver heart on a chain. "It's beautiful," Lydia said, surprised. At last, a present that was a present -- not a book, not a hint -- something she wanted, not something they wanted for her. This was the necklace she had longed for at Christmas. The chain slid through her fingers like a stream of water, so lithe it felt almost alive.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="盒子里是一条项链，拴着银制的心形挂坠。“真漂亮。”莉迪亚惊喜地说。她终于收到了像样的礼物——不是书，也不是暗示——是她想要的东西，而不是他们希望她要的。圣诞节时，她就盼望收到这样的项链。链子像流水一样滑下她的手指，非常柔软，似乎是活的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He fiddled with the clasp of the necklace, struggling with the tiny spring loop. "I wanted gold, but a reliable source told me everyone was wearing silver this year," he said. Lydia ran a finger along the velvet lining of the box. Her father was so concerned with what everyone was doing: I'm so glad you're going to the dance, honey -- everyone goes to the dance. Your hair looks so pretty that way, Lyddie -- everyone has long hair these days, right? Anytime she smiled: You should smile more -- everyone likes a girl who smiles. As if a dress and long hair and a smile could hide everything about her that was different. If her mother let her go out like the other girls, she thought, it might not matter what she looked like -- Jackie Harper had one blue eye and one green, and she'd been voted Most Social last year. Or if she looked like everyone else, perhaps it would not matter that she had to study all the time, that she could not go out on the weekends until she'd done all her homework, that she could not go out with boys at all. One or the other might be overcome. To be pulled both ways -- no dress, no book, no locket could help that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他笨拙地摆弄着项链的扣环，想把它打开。“我本来想买金的，但可靠人士告诉我，今年大家都戴银的。”他说。莉迪亚用手指摩挲着盒子的丝绒衬里。她父亲非常关心“大家”都在做什么。你去跳舞，我很高兴，亲爱的——大家都去跳舞。你的头发那样弄很好看，莉迪——大家最近都在留长发，对吗？当她微笑的时候，你应该多笑笑——大家都喜欢爱笑的女孩。好像一件衣服、一头长发、一个微笑就能掩盖她与“大家”的不同之处。要是母亲允许她和其他女孩那样出去的话，她想，自己不管是什么样子都无所谓——杰姬·哈珀一只眼睛是蓝色的，另一只是绿的，去年，她照样当选为“最受欢迎的学生”。或许，如果她的外表和别人一样的话，她就不用一直都努力用功，不用连周末都要先完成作业才能出门，也不会被禁止和男孩出门。这些问题都不再将是问题。至于衣服、书或者项链什么的，根本不具备如此巨大的作用。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I know this year has been tough, and your mother's been asking a lot of you," James said. "Just remember, school isn't everything. It's not as important as friendship, or love." Already he could see a faint line worrying a crease between Lydia's brows, dark circles blooming beneath her eyes from late-night studying. He wanted to smooth that wrinkle with his thumb, to wipe the shadows away like dust. "Every time you look at this, just remember what really matters. Every time you look at this, I want you to smile. Promise?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我知道今年你压力很大，你母亲对你要求很高。”詹姆斯说，“要记住，学校不是生活的全部，它并没有友情或者爱情那么重要。”他已经能从莉迪亚的眉心看出一道忧心忡忡的纹路，由于用功到深夜，她的眼睛下面也出现了黑眼圈。他想用拇指抚平那道皱纹，像擦拭灰尘那样抹掉女儿的黑眼圈。“每当你看到它，不要忘记什么才是真正重要的。每当你看到它，我希望你能笑一笑。好吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"There we go," James said, the catch springing open at last. He refastened it at her nape, and the metal cut a line of cold, like a ring of ice, around her throat. "What do you think? Do you like it?" Lydia understood: this was meant to remind her of all he wanted for her. Like a string tied around her finger, only this lay around her neck.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好了。”詹姆斯说，他终于打开了扣环。他给女儿戴上项链，金属在她脖子上形成一道冷硬的线条，如同一只冰环围绕着她的喉咙。“你觉得怎么样？你喜欢它吗？”莉迪亚明白，他是想提醒她，不要忘记他的期望。这与缠在她手指上的丝线没有什么不同，唯一的区别是，项链是挂在她脖子上的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The next day, in honor of her birthday, she wore the necklace, as her father suggested. "Right after school," James told her, "I'll take you over to get your permit and we'll have our first driving lesson before dinner." Her mother said, "And after dinner, we'll have cake. And I've got some special presents for the birthday girl." Which meant books, Lydia thought. That night Nath would pack his suitcase. All day she consoled herself: In six hours, I will have my permit. In two weeks, I will be able to drive away.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Five," Louisa said. "I'm just a poor grad student, not a rich professor." She patted his arm playfully, and the tenderness in her face shocked Lydia. Her mother looked at her father this way, late at night, when he was caught up in his reading and she leaned against his armchair affectionately, before nudging him to bed. Louisa's hand lingered on her father's arm and Lydia stared at them, her father and this girl, cozy in the front seat like a little married couple, a tableau framed by the bright screen of the windshield, and she thought suddenly: This girl is sleeping with my father.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我赌五美元。”路易莎说，“我只是个贫穷的研究生，不是有钱的教授。”她顽皮地拍拍他的肩膀，脸上温柔的表情震撼了莉迪亚。她母亲也是这么看她父亲的。夜深人静时，当玛丽琳发现詹姆斯还在看书，她会亲昵地斜靠在扶手椅上，催促他上床。路易莎的手在她父亲的胳膊上流连，莉迪亚盯着他们，她父亲和这个女孩亲密地坐在那里，像一对小夫妻，他们在挡风玻璃上的倒影，宛如一幅结婚照。莉迪亚突然意识到：这个女孩在和我父亲睡觉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It had never occurred to her before to think of her father as a man with desires. Like all teenagers, she preferred -- despite her very existence -- to imagine her parents as eternally chaste. But there was something in the way her father and Louisa touched, in their easy banter, that shocked her innocent sensibilities. To her, the faint crackle between them blazed so hotly that her cheeks flushed. They were lovers. She was sure of it. Louisa's hand was still on her father's arm and her father didn't move, as if the caress were nothing unusual. In fact, James did not even notice: Marilyn often rested her hand on him just this way, and the feeling was too familiar to stand out. For Lydia, however, the way her father kept looking straight ahead, eyes still scanning the road, was all the confirmation she needed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她以前从未想过，自己的父亲也是个有欲望的男人。与所有青少年一样，她更愿意——尽管她自己就是反例——把父母想象成纯洁而忠贞的男女。所以，亲眼见到她父亲和路易莎动作暧昧、举止随意，莉迪亚颇感震惊，连她都觉得不好意思了。他们是情人。她敢肯定。路易莎的手仍然放在她父亲的胳膊上，她父亲也没有动，好像这种爱抚十分平常。实际上，詹姆斯根本没有注意，玛丽琳也经常这样把手放在他身上，他已经习以为常，无法引起警觉。然而，对莉迪亚而言，看到父亲目不斜视地打量着路面，更加证实了她的判断。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At that moment Lydia realized the room had gone silent. Everyone's head was bent over the test. She looked up at the clock, but it told her nothing: not when they started, not when the test ended, only the time, three forty-one. The second hand tick-tick-ticked around from eleven to twelve and the minute hand, like a long iron needle, jumped forward another notch. Three forty-two. She flipped her booklet open. What color is a stop sign? She filled in the circle for B: Red. What must you do if you see or hear an emergency vehicle coming from any direction? In her haste, the pencil slipped outside the bubble in a jagged claw. A few rows up, a girl with pigtails rose, and the woman at the front gestured her into the next room. A moment later, the boy sitting next to her did the same. Lydia looked down at her booklet again. Twenty questions. Eighteen left to go.</div>

Lydia made her way toward the back corner of the room, stepping over bookbags and purses and the legs of the boy in the next-to-last row. Everything her father had ever said to her bounced back in a new tone: You can never have too many friends.

How much distance should you leave between yourself and the vehicle in front of you under good road conditions? To her right, a man with a mustache closed his booklet and put down his pencil. C, Lydia guessed. A. D. On the next page, she found a list of sentences she could not complete.

Nath was up in his room, packing for his trip, and alone with her youngest, she was planning aloud, half talking to herself. Hannah, delighted to have her mother's attention even by default, nodded sagely. Under her breath she practiced -- Surprise! Surprise! -- and watched her mother pipe Lydia's name in blue onto the sheet cake. It was supposed to look like a driver's license, a white-frosted rectangle with a photo of Lydia in the corner where the real photograph would be. Inside, it was chocolate cake. Because this was an extra-special birthday, Marilyn had baked this cake herself -- from a box, true, but she had mixed it, one hand moving the mixer through the cake batter, the other holding the battered aluminum bowl still against the whirling blades. She had let Hannah pick out the tub of frosting, and now she squeezed out the last of the tube of decorator's icing spelling L-Y-D and reached into the grocery bag for another.</div>

<div class="line_en">Such a special cake, Hannah thought, would taste extra-special, too. Better than just plain vanilla or chocolate. The box had shown a smiling woman hovering over a slice of cake and the words You mix in the love. Love, Hannah decided, would be sweet, like her mother's perfume, and soft as marshmallows. Quietly she extended a finger, gouging a small dip in the perfectly smooth surface of the cake. "Hannah!" Marilyn snapped, and swatted her hand away.</div>

Then her mother would understand that she hadn't meant to mess up the cake. But as she reached out, Marilyn set down the tube of icing mid-letter and lifted her head, listening. "That can't be them already."</div>

<div class="line_en">Upstairs, in her room, Lydia yanked at the necklace, which wouldn't break. She unhooked it and slammed it inside its box, as if it were a wild thing, and pushed it deep beneath the bed. If her father asked where it was, she would say she was saving it for special occasions. She would say she didn't want to lose it, don't worry, she'd wear it next time, Daddy. In the mirror, a fine red line ringed her neck.</div>

<div class="line_en">"What happened?" Marilyn murmured to James, who shook his head. Hannah knew. Lydia hadn't studied. Two weeks ago, before Lydia had come home after school, Hannah had explored her room, looking for treasures. She'd pocketed Lydia's book from the floor of the closet and, beneath it, had found the rules and regulations pamphlet. When Lydia started to study, Hannah had thought, she would notice her book was missing. She would come looking for it. Every few days, she had checked, but the pamphlet hadn't moved. Yesterday it had been half-covered by a pair of beige platforms and Lydia's best bell-bottoms. And the book was still tucked upstairs under Hannah's pillow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“怎么回事？”玛丽琳低声问詹姆斯，他摇摇头。汉娜知道为什么。莉迪亚没有学习交通规则。两周前的一天，莉迪亚还没放学的时候，汉娜跑到她房间探险，寻找宝藏。她在柜子底部找到莉迪亚的一本书，把它装进自己的口袋，然后，在书下面，她看到印着交通规则的小册子。莉迪亚开始学习的时候，汉娜想，她应该注意到自己的书不见了，然后四处寻找。每隔几天，她就跑到姐姐房间察看，结果发现那本交通规则根本没有挪过窝。昨天，小册子上面压了一双米色高跟厚底鞋和莉迪亚最好的喇叭裤。而那本书仍旧藏在汉娜卧室的枕头底下。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">By the time Lydia came down to dinner an hour later, the mark had faded away, though the feeling that accompanied it had not. She had dressed up as if for a party, her hair ironed dry and straight and glossy on the big ironing board, her lips coated with jam-colored gloss. James, looking at her, had a sudden memory of Marilyn when they'd first met. "Don't you look nice," he said, and Lydia forced herself to smile. She sat bolt upright with that same fake smile at the dinner table, like a doll on display, but only Hannah spotted its fakeness. Her back ached, watching Lydia, every bit of her did, and she slouched in her own chair until she nearly slid off the seat. As soon as dinner was over, Lydia patted her mouth with her napkin and stood up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个小时后，莉迪亚下楼吃饭，那道痕迹已经消褪了，但痛苦的感觉还在。她打扮得像是去参加派对，头发熨得干干的，又直又光滑，嘴上涂着果酱色的唇膏。詹姆斯看着女儿，突然想起他和玛丽琳初次见面的时候。“你真美。”他说，莉迪亚挤出一个笑容。她保持着刚才的假笑，在晚餐桌前直挺挺地坐着，像一只展示柜里的洋娃娃，但只有汉娜看出那笑容有多虚假。她难受地看着莉迪亚，观察她的一举一动，无精打采地坐在自己的椅子里，最后差点从上面滑下来。晚餐一结束，莉迪亚就拿餐巾拍拍嘴，站了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Wait," Marilyn said. "There's cake." She went into the kitchen and in a moment emerged bearing the cake on a tray, candles aglow. The photo of Lydia was gone, the top of the cake refrosted to plain white, with just Lydia's name. Hiding under the smooth white, Hannah thought, was the pretend driver's license, the Congratulations and the blue L-Y-D. Though you couldn't see it, it was there just underneath, covered up but smudged and unreadable and horrible. And you'd be able to taste it, too. Their father snapped picture after picture, but Hannah didn't smile. Unlike Lydia, she had not yet learned to pretend. Instead she half shut her eyes, like she did during the scary parts of TV shows, so that she could only half see what came next.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“等等，”玛丽琳说，“还有蛋糕呢。”她走进厨房，过了一会儿，用托盘端出一只蛋糕，还点着蜡烛。蛋糕上莉迪亚的照片不见了，重新用糖霜涂成白色，只写着莉迪亚的名字。汉娜想，藏在白色表层下面的，是原来的驾照图案，还有“祝贺”和“L—Y—D”几个字母。虽然你看不见，但它们就在下面，已经被抹平了，难以辨认，令人生厌。而且，当你吃的时候，还能尝出来。他们的父亲在不停地照相，但汉娜没有笑。与莉迪亚不同，她还没学会假装。她只能半闭着眼睛，仿佛看到电视上的恐怖镜头一样，这样她就能只看到一半接下来发生的事情了。">查看中文翻译</div>

As they reached the last line of the song, James held up the camera and she bent over the cake, lips pursed as if to kiss. Her perfectly made-up face smiled around the table, sweeping each of them in turn. Their mother. Their father. Nath. Hannah did not know everything Lydia thought she understood -- the necklace, Louisa, all I want you to remember -- but she knew that something had shifted inside her sister, that she was balanced on a dangerous, high-up ledge. She sat very still, as if one wrong move might tip Lydia off the edge, and Lydia blew out the flames with one quick puff.</div>
