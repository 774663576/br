<div class="line_en">'Who are YOU?'said the Caterpillar. This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation. Alice replied, rather shyly, 'I -- I hardly know, sir, just at present -- at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think I must have been changed several times since then.'</div>

<div class="line_en">The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in silence: at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.</div>

<div class="line_en">'I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly,' Alice replied very politely, 'for I can't understand it myself to begin with; and being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不能解释得更清楚了，”爱丽丝非常有礼貌地回答，“因为我压根儿不懂是怎么开始的，一天里改变好几次大小是非常不舒服的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“一点也不。”毛毛虫说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Which brought them back again to the beginning of the conversation. Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's making such VERY short remarks, and she drew herself up and said, very gravely, 'I think, you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这句话又把他们带回了谈话的开头，对于毛毛虫的那些非常简短的回答，爱丽丝颇有点不高兴了，她挺直了身子一本正经地说：“我想还是你先告诉我，你是谁？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“别发脾气嘛！”毛毛虫说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth hearing. For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth again, and said, 'So you think you're changed, do you?'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱丽丝想反正没什么事，不如在这儿等一等，也许最后它会说一点儿值得听的话的。有好几分钟，他只是喷着烟雾不说话。最后它松开胳膊，把水烟管从嘴里拿出来，说：“你认为你已经变了，是吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'Come back!' the Caterpillar called after her. 'I've something important to say!' This sounded promising, certainly: Alice turned and came back again.</div>

<div class="line_en">This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again. In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself.

<div class="line_cn" title="这次，爱丽丝耐心地等着它开口，一两分钟后，毛毛虫从嘴里拿出了水烟管，打了个哈欠，摇了摇身子，然后从蘑菇上下来，向草地爬去，只是在它爬的时候，顺口说道：“一边会使你长高，另一边会使你变矮。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“什么东西的一边，什么东西的另一边？”爱丽丝想。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question. However, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有那么一两分钟，爱丽丝端详着那个蘑菇，思讨着哪里是它的两边。由于它十公圆，爱丽丝发现这个问题可不容易解决。不管怎样，最后，她伸开双管环抱着它，而且尽量往远伸，然后两只手分别掰下了一块蘑菇边。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'And now which is which?' she said to herself, and nibbled a little of the right-hand bit to try the effect: the next moment she felt a violent blow underneath her chin: it had struck her foot! She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit. Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last, and managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可现在哪边是哪边呢？”她问自己，然后啃了右手那块试试。蓦地觉得下巴被猛烈地碰了一下：原来下巴碰着脚背了。这突然的变化使她战栗，缩得太快了，再不抓紧时间就完了，于是，她立即去吃另一块，虽然下巴同脚顶得太紧，几乎张不开口，但总算把左手的蘑菇啃着了一点。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction, like a serpent. She had just succeeded in curving it down into a graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a hurry: a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating her violently with its wings.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看起来，她的手没法举到头上来了，于是，她就试着把头弯下去凑近手。她高兴地发现自己的脖子像蛇一样，可以随便地往上下左右扭转，她把脖子朝下，变成一个“z”字形，准备伸进那些绿色海洋里去，发现这些绿色海洋不是别的，正是刚才曾经在它下面漫游的树林的树梢。就在这对，一种尖利的嘶声，使得她急忙缩回了头。一只大鸽子朝她脸上飞来，并且呼着翅膀疯狂地拍打她。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'What CAN all that green stuff be?' said Alice. 'And where HAVE my shoulders got to? And oh, my poor hands, how is it I can't see you?' She was moving them about as she spoke, but no result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the distant green leaves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那些绿东西是什么呢？”爱丽丝说，“我的肩膀呢？哎呀！我的可怜的双手啊，怎样才能再见到你们呢？”她说话时挥动着双手，可是除了远处的绿树丛中出现一些颤动外，什么也没有了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'Come, my head's free at last!' said Alice in a tone of delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found: all she could see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay far below her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，我的头自由了！”爱丽丝高兴地说，可是转眼间高兴变成了恐惧。这时，她发现找不见自己的肩膀了，她往下看时，只能见到了很长的脖子，这个脖子就像是矗立在绿色海洋中的高树杆。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">'Well, be off, then!' said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it settled down again into its nest.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was so long since she had been anything near the right size, that it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual. 'Come, there's half my plan done now! How puzzling all these changes are! I'm never sure what I'm going to be, from one minute to another! However, I've got back to my right size: the next thing is, to get into that beautiful garden -- how IS that to be done, I wonder?' As she said this, she came suddenly upon an open place, with a little house in it about four feet high. 'Whoever lives there,' thought Alice, 'it'll never do to come upon them THIS size: why, I should frighten them out of their wits!' So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself down to nine inches high.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="由于她已经不是正常高度了，所以开头还有点奇怪，不过几分钟就习惯了。然后又像平常那样同自己说话了。“好啊，现在我的计划完成一半了。这些变化多么奇怪，我无法知道下一分钟我会是什么样儿。不管怎样，现在我总算回到自己原来的大小了，下一件事情就是去那个美丽的花园。可是我不知道该怎么去做呢？”说话间来到了一片开阔地，这里有一间四英尺高的小房子。“别管是谁住在这里，”爱丽丝想，“我现在这样的大小不能进去，邓会把它们吓得灵魂出窍的，”她小口小口地咬了一点右手上的蘑菇，一直到自己变成九英寸高，才走向那座小房子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'It matters a good deal to ME,' said Alice hastily; 'but I'm not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't want YOURS: I don't like them raw.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这对我很不一样，”爱丽丝急忙分辩，“而且老实说，我不是在找蛋，就算我在找蛋，我还不要你的呢？我是不吃生蛋的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Alice crouched down among the trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and untwist it. After a while she remembered that she still held the pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱丽丝费劲儿地往树林里蹲，因为她的脖子常常会被树叉挂住，要随时停下来排解。过了一会，她想起了手里的两块蘑菇，于是她小心地咬咬这块，又咬咬那块，因此她一会儿L长高，一会缩小，最后终于使自己成了平常的高度了。">查看中文翻译</div>
