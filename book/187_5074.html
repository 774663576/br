<div class="line_en">Quick as lightning, Rishda Tarkaan leaped back out of reach of the King's sword. He was no coward, and would have fought single-handed against Tirian and the Dwarf if need were. But he could not take on the Eagle and the Unicorn as well. He knew how Eagles can fly into your face and peck at your eyes and blind you with their wings. And he had heard from his father (who had met Narnians in battle) that no man, except with arrows, or a long spear, can match a Unicorn, for it rears on its hind legs as it falls upon you and then you have its hoofs and its horn and its teeth to deal with all at once. So he rushed into the crowd and stood calling out:</div>

<div class="line_en">While this was happening two other things happened as well. The Ape had not realized his danger as quickly as the Tarkaan. For a second or so he remained squatting beside the fire staring at the newcomers. Then Tirian rushed upon the wretched creature, picked it up by the scruff of the neck, and dashed back to the stable shouting, "Open the door!" Poggin opened it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这件事发生的时候，还同时发生了另外两件事。无尾猿不像那泰坎那样迅速地认识到处境的危险。大约有一两秒钟，它依旧蹲在篝火旁，定晴望着新来的野兽们。接着蒂莲就向那倒霉的家伙猛扑过去，抓住它的颈背把它拎了起来，然后冲回马厩，大叫道：“开门。”波金打开马厩的门。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Go and drink your own medicine, Shift!" said Tirian and hurled the Ape through into the darkness. But as the Dwarf banged the door shut again, a blinding greenish-blue light shone out from the inside of the stable, the earth shook, and there was a strange noise -- a clucking and screaming as if it was the hoarse voice of some monstrous bird. The Beasts moaned and howled and called out "Tashlan! Hide us from him!" and many fell down, and many hid their faces in their wings or paws. No one except Farsight the Eagle, who has the best eyes of all living things, noticed the face of Rishda Tarkaan at that moment. And from what Farsight saw there he knew at once that Rishda was just as surprised, and nearly frightened, as everyone else. "There goes one," thought Farsight, "who has called on gods he does not believe in. How will it be with him if they have really come?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“诡谲，进去喝你自己的药吧！”蒂莲一边说，一边把无尾猿往马厩里的黑暗中扔了进去。但小矮人砰的一声重新把门关上时，一道令人目眩的蓝绿色的强光从马厩里照射出来，大地震动了，响起了一种奇怪的声音——一种咯咯的叫嚣声，仿佛是某种怪鸟嘶哑的叫声。野兽们呜咽、号哭、大声呼喊。“塔什兰！遮掩我们，别让它看见！”许多禽兽倒下了，许多禽兽把自己的脸躲在翅膀或是脚爪下面。此时此刻，除了生着一切生物中最好的眼睛的老鹰外，没有哪一个注意过利什达泰坎的脸。千里眼老鹰凭它所看到的情况立刻就知道：利什达同大家一模一样的感到奇怪，几乎同大家一样的诚惶诚恐。“一个走了，”老鹰心中想道，“他曾向他并不相信的诸神呼吁。如果诸神真的来了，他将怎么办呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The third thing -- which also happened at the same moment -- was the only really beautiful thing that night. Every single Talking Dog in the whole meeting (there were fifteen of them) came bounding and barking joyously to the King's side. They were mostly great big dogs with thick shoulders and heavy jaws. Their coming was like the breaking of a great wave on the seabeach: it nearly knocked you down. For though they were Talking Dogs they were just as doggy as they could be: and they all stood up and put their front paws on the shoulders of the humans and licked their faces, all saying at once: "Welcome! Welcome! We'll help, we'll help, help, help. Show us how to help, show us how, how. How-how-how?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="也在同时发生的第三件事，是那天夜里真正美丽的事情。大会上的每头会说人话的狗儿（总共十五头）欢乐地跳着吠着跑到国王这边来了。它们大部分是了不得的大狗，肩膀厚实，上下腭厚重。群狗的来势像是巨浪冲击海滩，几乎要把你冲倒。因为，它们虽然是会人话的狗儿，却又是尽可能发挥狗性的狗儿：它们都双脚站了起来，前腿的爪子搭在人的肩膀上，用舌头舔舔人的脸，它们大家立刻说道：“欢迎！欢迎！我们决心帮忙，帮忙，帮忙。告诉我们怎么个帮法，怎么个帮法，怎么，怎么——怎么——怎么？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was so lovely that it made you want to cry. This, at last, was the sort of thing they had been hoping for. And when, a moment later, several little animals (mice and moles and a squirrel or so) came pattering up, squealing with joy, and saying "See, see. We're here," and when, after that, the Bear and the Boar came too, Eustace began to feel that perhaps, after all, everything might be going to come right. But Tirian gazed round and saw how very few of the animals had moved.</div>

<div class="line_en">Eustace could never remember what happened in the next two minutes. It was all like a dream (the sort you have when your temperature is over 100) until he heard Rishda Tarkaan's voice calling out from the distance:</div>

<div class="line_en">Eustace stood with his heart beating terribly, hoping and hoping that he would be brave. He had never seen anything (though he had seen both a dragon and a seaserpent) that made his blood run so cold as that line of dark-faced bright-eyed men. There were fifteen Calormenes, a Talking Bull of Narnia, Slinkey the Fox, and Wraggle the Satyr. Then he heard twang-and-zipp on his left and one Calormene fell: then twang-andzipp again and the Satyr was down. "Oh, well done, daughter!" came Tirian's voice; and then the enemy were upon them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尤斯塔斯站在那里，心怦怦乱跳，他希望，希望自己会大胆勇敢。他从来没有看见过像面孔墨黑眼睛发亮的队伍那样使他血液冰凉的东西，尽管他看见过一条飞龙和一条海蛇。敌方是十五个卡乐门兵，一头纳尼亚的会说人话的公牛，狐狸斯林基，半神半兽的森林之神拉格尔。然后他听到左边儿嘣的一响、嗖的一声，一个卡乐门士兵应声倒下了；接着又是蹦的一响、嗖的一声，半神半兽的森林之神也应声倒下了。“啊，射得好，女儿！”传来了蒂莲的赞美声；接着是敌人向他们进攻。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then Eustace came to his senses and saw the Calormenes scampering back to their friends. But not all of them. Two lay dead, pierced by Jewel's horn, one by Tirian's sword. The Fox lay dead at his own feet, and he wondered if it was he who had killed it. The Bull also was down, shot through the eye by an arrow from Jill and gashed in his side by the Boar's tusk. But our side had its losses too. Three dogs were killed and a fourth was hobbling behind the line on three legs and whimpering. The Bear lay on the ground, moving feebly. Then it mumbled in its throaty voice, bewildered to the last, "I -- I don't understand," laid its big head down on the grass as quietly as a child going to sleep, and never moved again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是尤斯塔斯恢复了知觉，看见卡乐门士兵向他们的朋友们惊惶地跑回去。但并非都跑回去了。两个倒毙在地上，一个是珍宝的独角戳死的，一个是蒂莲的剑杀死的。狐狸死在他脚边，他弄不清是不是他自己把它宰了的。公牛也倒下了，吉尔的一箭射中了它的眼睛，野猪的獠牙口叫它胁部裂开了。但我方也有损失。三条狗被杀死了，第四条狗凭着三条腿在战线后面蹒跚行走，嘴里呜咽哀鸣。熊躺在地上，虚弱无力地挪动着。它最终还是迷惑不解，喉咙里咕咕哝哝地说道：“我——我不——明白。”接着就像一个小孩儿落入睡眠一样，大脑袋平静地落到草地上，永远不再动弹了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Good," said Tirian. "Now look yonder to our left. You see a great rock that gleams white like marble in the firelight. First we will fall upon those Calormenes. You, maiden, shall move out on our left and shoot as fast as ever you may into their ranks: and you, Eagle, fly at their faces from the right. Meanwhile we others will be charging them. When we are so close, Jill, that you can no longer shoot at them for fear of striking us, go back to the white rock and wait. You others, keep your ears wide even in the fighting. We must put them to flight in a few minutes or else not at all, for we are fewer than they. As soon as I call Back, then rush to join Jill at the white rock, where we shall have protection behind us and can breathe awhile. Now, be off, Jill."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“行，”蒂莲说道，“现在往我们的左边瞧瞧。你看到一块大石头，在火光里像大理石一样闪耀着雪白的光彩。首先我们要袭击那些卡乐门士兵，小姐，你运动到我们的左边，尽力把箭迅速射进他们的队伍里去；老鹰，你从左边飞过去，袭击他们的脸。与此同时，我们其他的人马就向他们冲去。当我们逼近敌人时，吉尔，怕误射了自己人，你就不能再射箭了，你可以回到白石头那儿等候。你们其他的人，即使在作战时也要竖起耳朵细听。我们必须在几分钟之内把他们打得四散逃跑，不然就压根儿打不跑他们了，因为我们的人员比他们少。我一叫后退，你们就跑到大石头那儿与吉尔会合，我们在那石头后面可以有个掩护，可以有一会儿歇口气。现在，吉尔，出发吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Feeling terribly alone, Jill ran out about twenty feet, put her right leg back and her left leg forward, and set an arrow to her string. She wished her hands were not shaking so. "'That's a rotten shot!" she said as her first arrow sped towards the enemy and flew over their heads. But she had another on the string next moment: she knew that speed was what mattered. She saw something big and black darting into the faces of the Calormenes. 'that was Farsight. First one man, and then another, dropped his sword and put up both his hands to defend his eyes. Then one of her own arrows hit a man, and another hit a Narnian wolf, who had, it seemed, joined the enemy. But she had been shooting only for a few seconds when she had to stop. With a flash of swords and of the Boar's tusks and Jewel's horn, and with deep baying from the dogs, Tirian and his party were rushing on their enemies, like men in a hundred yards' race. Jill was astonished to see how unprepared the Calormenes seemed to be. She did not realize that this was the result of her work and the Eagle's. Very few troops can keep on looking steadily to the front if they are getting arrows in their faces from one side and being pecked by an eagle on the other.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉尔觉得孤零零得可怕，她向前跑了二十英尺光景，右腿右伸，左腿前伸，箭搭在弦上，她但愿她的双手别那么发抖。她的第一支箭迅速向敌人射去，越过敌人的脑袋飞开去了。她说道：“这一箭可射糟了。”但她随即搭上第二支箭，她知道，重要的是射箭的速度，要打他个措手不及。她看到一个又大又黑的东西，扑到了卡乐门士兵的脸上。那是千里眼老鹰。起初是一个兵，随即是其他的兵，丢下手里的剑，举起双手护住自己的眼睛。然后是她射出的一支箭击中了一个士兵，另一支又击中了一头纳尼亚狼，这狼好像参加了敌人的队伍。但她刚射了几秒钟就不得不停止了。蒂莲及其伙伴向敌人猛冲过去了，仿佛百米赛跑似的，剑光闪闪，野猪的獠牙和珍宝的独角横冲直撞，狗儿们吠叫呐喊。吉尔诧异地看到卡乐门士兵仿佛处于毫无准备的状态，她并未认识到这正是她和老鹰的汗马功劳。军队如果一边受到利箭的射击，另一边又受到老鹰尖嘴的猛啄，是很少能稳稳地瞅着正面的战线的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh well done. Well done!" shouted Jill. The King's party were cutting their way right into the enemy. The Unicorn was tossing men as you'd toss hay on a fork. Even Eustace seemed to Jill (who after all didn't know very much about swordsmanship) to be fighting brilliantly. The Dogs were at the Calormenes' throats. It was going to work! It was victory at last -- With a horrible, cold shock Jill noticed a strange thing. Though Calormenes were falling at each Narnian sword-stroke, they never seemed to get any fewer. In fact, there were actually more of them now than when the fight began. There were more every second. They were running up from every side. They were new Calormenes. These new ones had spears. There was such a crowd of them that she could hardly see her own friends. Then she heard Tirian's voice crying: "Back! To the rock!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，打得好！打得好！”吉尔大叫大喊。国王的队伍夺路攻入敌阵。独角兽用独角挑起人来就像你用叉子挑动干草一样。在吉尔看来，甚至尤斯塔斯（他毕竟对剑术知之甚少）也打得挺漂亮。狗儿们正咬着卡乐门士兵的喉咙。战斗正在顺利进行。终于胜利在望了——吉尔浑身打了一个可怕的寒颤：她把一件奇怪的事情看在眼里啦。虽然每次纳尼亚的利剑劈将下去，必有卡乐门士兵倒毙，可是卡乐门士兵的数量，似乎一点儿也没有减少。事实上，对方的兵员，反而比战斗开始时确实增多了。每一秒钟都有兵员增加。他们从四面八方奔跑而来。他们是新来的卡乐门士兵。这些新来乍到的兵都有长矛。敌方兵员涌过来一大群，吉尔没法儿望见她的战友们了。接着她听见蒂莲喊叫的声音：“撤退！撤到白石头去！”">查看中文翻译</div>
