<div class="line_en">She opened her eyes and stared up blind at the black that shrouded her, her dream already fading. So beautiful. She licked her lips, remembering. The bleating of the sheep, the terror in the shepherd's eyes, the sound the dogs had made as she killed them one by one, the snarling of her pack. Game had become scarcer since the snows began to fall, but last night they had feasted. Lamb and dog and mutton and the flesh of man. Some of her little grey cousins were afraid of men, even dead men, but not her. Meat was meat, and men were prey. She was the night wolf.</div>

<div class="line_en">The blind girl rolled onto her side, sat up, sprang to her feet, stretched. Her bed was a rag-stuffed mattress on a shelf of cold stone, and she was always stiff and tight when she awakened. She padded to her basin on small, bare, callused feet, silent as a shadow, splashed cool water on her face, patted herself dry. Ser Gregor, she thought. Dunsen, Raff the Sweetling. Ser Ilyn, Ser Meryn, Queen Cersei. Her morning prayer. Or was it? No, she thought, not mine. I am no one. That is the night wolf's prayer. Someday she will find them, hunt them, smell their fear, taste their blood. Someday.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="失明的女孩侧身坐了起来，伸了伸脚。她的床只是冰冷石头架子上塞满碎布的床垫，所以醒来之后经常觉得四肢僵硬。她赤着长满茧子的小脚，轻轻地走向水槽，静如影。冷水泼在脸上，然后再拍干。“格雷果爵士”她想，“邓森、‘甜‘拉夫、伊林爵士、马林爵士、瑟曦太后”，这是她的晨祷。这是吗？不，她想，不是我的。我是无名之辈，而那是夜狼的祈祷。终有一天她会找到他们、追捕他们，享受他们的恐惧、品味他们鲜血的滋味，会有那么一天的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She found her smallclothes in a pile, sniffed at them to make sure they were fresh enough to wear, donned them in her darkness. Her servant's garb was where she'd hung it -- a long tunic of undyed wool, roughspun and scratchy. She snapped it out and pulled it down over her head with one smooth practiced motion. Socks came last. One black, one white. The black one had stitching round the top, the white none; she could feel which was which, make sure she got each sock on the right leg. Skinny as they were, her legs were strong and springy and growing longer every day.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她在衣架上摸索到了她小小的衣服，闻了闻，以确定它们还够干净。在黑暗里，她穿好了衣服。她仆人的衣服还在她挂的地方，这是一件未经染色的羊毛外衣，由粗棉纱织成，走起路来沙沙作响。她将外衣套在头上，轻轻的拉下，最后穿的是袜子。两只袜子一只黑色、一只白色。黑色那只在顶部缝了一圈布，白的那只没有，所以她能够分清楚左右脚，不会穿错。尽管还是很瘦，但她的腿每天都长长，变的结实富有弹性。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She knew the way to the kitchens, but her nose would have led her there even if she hadn't. Hot peppers and fried fish, she decided, sniffing down the hall, and bread fresh from Umma's oven. The smells made her belly rumble. The night wolf had feasted, but that would not fill the blind girl's belly. Dream meat could not nourish her, she had learned that early on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她知道去厨房的路，不过她的鼻子已经在她之前就到了那里。辣椒和炸鱼的味道，她对自己说，顺着大厅闻过去，是乌玛烤箱里传出的新鲜面包的味道。香味让她的肚子咕咕作响。夜狼享受了盛宴，但这填补不了盲眼女孩的胃。梦里的肉给不了她营养，这一天她早就知道了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She broke her fast on sardines, fried crisp in pepper oil and served so hot they burned her fingers. She mopped up the leftover oil with a chunk of bread torn off the end of Umma's morning loaf and washed it all down with a cup of watered wine, savoring the tastes and the smells, the rough feel of the crust beneath her fingers, the slickness of the oil, the sting of the hot pepper when it got into the half-healed scrape on the back of the hand. Hear, smell, taste, feel, she reminded herself. There are many ways to know the world for those who cannot see.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她打破了自己吃沙丁鱼的速度记录，炸鱼块上的辣椒油太烫了，刺的手指火辣辣的痛。她从乌玛早上烤的面包上面扯下来一块，擦干净手上的油，配一杯兑水的葡萄酒吃掉了。品味着食物的味道和香气，感受着手指上茧的粗糙、滑腻腻的油、辣椒钻进手背的刺痛。听觉、嗅觉、味觉、感觉，她提醒自己，尽管看不到，但还是有很多方法去认识这个世界。">查看中文翻译</div>

Sometimes all she had to go on was tone and choice of words; other times the waif allowed her to lay hands upon her face.

<div class="line_en">She could feel air currents on her skin now. She could find the kitchens by their smell, tell men from women by their scents. She knew Umma and the servants and the acolytes by the pattern of their footfalls, could tell one from the other before they got close enough to smell (but not the waif or the kindly man, who hardly made a sound at all unless they wanted to). The candles burning in the temple had scents as well; even the unscented ones gave off faint wisps of smoke from their wicks. They had as well been shouting, once she had learned to use her nose.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在，她能感觉到皮肤上的气流，通过嗅觉他能找到厨房、通过不同的气味她能分辨男女。通过脚步声，她能够分出乌玛、仆人或者侍僧。只要靠近到嗅觉范围内，她能够将一个人从一群人中分开（但对流浪儿和慈祥之人不行，除非他们故意，否则几乎不会发出任何声音）。神庙里燃烧的蜡烛也会散发出味道，即使是那些没味道的蜡烛，也会通过灯芯散发出缕缕淡淡的烟雾。一旦她学会了用鼻子去听，它们也有自己的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Some nights she might have cried herself to sleep if she had still been Arry or Weasel or Cat, or even Arya of House Stark… but no one had no tears. Without eyes, even the simplest task was perilous. She burned herself a dozen times as she worked with Umma in the kitchens. Once, chopping onions, she cut her finger down to the bone. Twice she could not even find her own room in the cellar and had to sleep on the floor at the base of the steps. All the nooks and alcoves made the temple treacherous, even after the blind girl had learned to use her ears; the way her footsteps bounced off the ceiling and echoed round the legs of the thirty tall stone gods made the walls themselves seem to move, and the pool of still black water did strange things to sound as well.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有些夜晚，当她是阿利或黄鼠狼或者猫儿，甚至是史塔克家的艾莉亚的时候，她会哭着入睡。但无名之辈没有眼泪。眼睛看不见之后，就算是最简单的工作也充满危险。在厨房给乌玛帮厨的时候，她把自己烧伤了十几次。又一次，在切洋葱的时候，她切到了自己的手指，骨头都露出来了。有两次，她找不到自己地下室的房间，只好睡在台阶下面。角落和壁炉让神庙显得变化莫测，尽管盲眼女孩已经学会用耳朵去听，但她的脚步的回声在天花板和三十个高大的神像的长腿之间传递，听起来好像墙壁自己会走一样。黑色的水池同样也会发出听起来奇怪的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="这个早上，她发现了两个死人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One man had died at the feet of the Stranger, a single candle flickering above him. She could feel its heat, and the scent that it gave off tickled her nose. The candle burned with a dark red flame, she knew; for those with eyes, the corpse would have seemed awash in a ruddy glow. Before summoning the serving men to carry him away, she knelt and felt his face, tracing the line of his jaw, brushing her fingers across his cheeks and nose, touching his hair. Curly hair, and thick. A handsome face, unlined. He was young. She wondered what had brought him here to seek the gift of death. Dying bravos oft found their way to the House of Black and White, to hasten their ends, but this man had no wounds that she could find.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其中一个是男子，死在陌客的脚边，孤零零的蜡烛闪烁着摇摆不定的光，照在他的身上。她能够感觉到蜡烛的热量，蜡烛燃烧发出的气味也刺激着她的鼻子。她知道燃烧的蜡烛有着暗红色的火焰，如果用眼睛去看的话，尸体将会是沐浴在红光之下。在尸体被侍僧清理掉之前，她跪了下来，感受他的脸。手指经过下巴的轮廓线，穿过他的口鼻，触碰到了他的头发，他的头发是蜷曲的，很厚。这是一张英俊的脸，他很年轻，仅身着单衣。她很想知道是什么原因令他来寻求千面之神的恩赐。濒死的布拉佛斯人经常能够找到来黑白之院的路，加速他们生命结束的过程。但艾莉亚在他身上没有发现伤口。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The dead men had their own smell too. One of her duties was to find them in the temple every morning, wherever they had chosen to lie down and close their eyes after drinking from the pool.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="死人也有自己的味道。艾莉亚的工作职责之一就是在每天清晨在神庙里寻找死人。无论他们选择躺在神庙的什么地方。在他们喝掉水池里的水死掉之后，帮他们闭上眼睛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The second body was that of an old woman. She had gone to sleep upon a dreaming couch, in one of the hidden alcoves where special candles conjured visions of things loved and lost. A sweet death and a gentle one, the kindly man was fond of saying. Her fingers told her that the old woman had died with a smile on her face. She had not been dead long. Her body was still warm to the touch. Her skin is so soft, like old thin leather that's been folded and wrinkled a thousand times.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="另外一个是一位老妇人，她躺在一张理想的床上——在一个隐藏的壁龛里。那里特别的蜡烛总是容易让人想起那些爱过和失去的事物。温柔而甜蜜的死亡，慈祥之人经常这样说。她的手指告诉她，老妇人是面带笑容死去的。她并没有死去太久，身体摸起来还有温度，皮肤也还像鞣过上千次的皮子一样柔软。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The corpses were laid out in the vault. The blind girl went to work in the dark, stripping the dead of boots and clothes and other possessions, emptying their purses and counting out their coins. Telling one coin from another by touch alone was one of the first things the waif had taught her, after they took away her eyes. The Braavosi coins were old friends; she need only brush her fingertips across their faces to recognize them. Coins from other lands and cities were harder, especially those from far away. Volantene honors were most common, little coins no bigger than a penny with a crown on one side and a skull on the other. Lysene coins were oval and showed a naked woman. Other coins had ships stamped onto them, or elephants, or goats. The Westerosi coins showed a king's head on the front and a dragon on the back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="死去的人的尸体被放置在地下室里，盲眼女孩在黑暗里工作。她剥掉死人的衣服、靴子以及其它物品，清空他们的钱包清点他们的财产。通过触摸来分辨不同的钱币，是在她失明之后，流浪儿教她的第一件事。布拉佛斯钱币就像是老朋友一样，她只需要将手指划过钱币的表面就能将他们认出来。来自其他大陆和自由贸易城邦，尤其是来自遥远的远方的钱币分辨起来就困难的多。瓦兰提斯的钱币是最常见的，小小的金币和铜星差不多大，一面是王冠、一面是头像。Lysene（里斯？）的金币是椭圆形的，上面的图案是裸女。其它地方的钱币上面图案也是各异，有船舶、大象或者山羊。维斯特洛的钱币正面是国王的头像，背面是一条龙。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When the serving men arrived to bear the corpse away, the blind girl followed them. She let their footsteps be her guide, but when they made their descent she counted. She knew the counts of all the steps by heart. Under the temple was a maze of vaults and tunnels where even men with two good eyes were often lost, but the blind girl had learned every inch of it, and she had her stick to help her find her way should her memory falter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当仆人们把尸体带走的时候，盲眼女孩跟着他们，他们的脚步声就是她的向导。当他们向下走的时候，她就开始计数，现在她知道所有台阶的数量。黑白之院的下面是储藏室和隧道构成的迷宫，就算是双眼正常的人也常常会迷路。盲眼女孩了解这里的每一寸地方，当与记忆有偏差的时候，手杖会帮她找到正确的路。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The old woman had no purse, no wealth at all but for a ring on one thin finger. On the handsome man she found four golden dragons out of Westeros. She was running the ball of her thumb across the most worn of them, trying to decide which king it showed, when she heard the door opening softly behind her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="老妇人没有钱包，身上也没有值钱的东西，只有纤细的手指上戴着一枚戒指。在英俊的年轻人身上她找到了4枚维斯特洛的金龙。当背后的门轻轻打开的时候，她正在用拇指感受金龙的磨损，试图确认上面是哪一个国王。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The girl darted sideways, her stick spinning, heard a sound behind her, whirled in that direction, struck at air.

She did not remember ever hearing his voice before, but what was there to say that the servants of the Many-Faced God could not change their voices as easily as they did their faces? Besides her, the House of Black and White was home to two serving men, three acolytes, Umma the cook, and the two priests that she called the waif and the kindly man. Others came and went, sometimes by secret ways, but those were the only ones who lived here. Her nemesis could be any of them.</div>

<div class="line_en">The old woman's corpse was cool by now, the bravo's body stiffening. The girl was used to that. Most days, she spent more time with the dead than with the living. She missed the friends she'd had when she was Cat of the Canals; Old Brusco with his bad back, his daughters Talea and Brea, the mummers from the Ship, Merry and her whores at the Happy Port, all the other rogues and wharfside scum. She missed Cat herself the most of all, even more than she missed her eyes. She had liked being Cat, more than she had ever liked being Salty or Squab or Weasel or Arry. I killed Cat when I killed that singer. The kindly man had told her that they would have taken her eyes from her anyway, to help her to learn to use her other senses, but not for half a year. Blind acolytes were common in the House of Black and White, but few as young as she. The girl was not sorry, though. Dareon had been a deserter from the Night's Watch; he had deserved to die.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="老妇人的尸体已经冷了下来，小伙的身体则已经僵硬，女孩已经习惯这些了。她和死人在一起的时间比和活人在一起的多。当她是运河上的猫儿的时候她就失去了她的朋友们。老布鲁斯科和他有病的脊背，他的女儿泰丽亚和布瑞亚，船上的哑剧演员，快乐码头的玛丽和她的妓女们，还有其它那些流氓和码头边闲晃的混混们。最重要的是她失去了猫儿她自己，甚至比失去双眼更重要。她喜欢做猫儿多过做阿盐、乳鸽、黄鼠狼和阿利。当我杀掉那个歌手的时候我也就杀死了猫儿。慈祥之人说过他们会用任何方法让她失明，好让她学会使用身体的其它官能，但他没说要半年这么长的时间。盲眼侍僧在黑白之院里很常见，但是很少有像她这么年幼的。不过女孩丝毫不感到遗憾，戴利恩是守夜人的逃兵，他唯有一死。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No one beat me." The girl crawled on all fours until she found her stick, then sprang back to her feet, bruised and dirty. The vault was still and silent. He was gone. Or was he? He could be standing right beside her, she would never know. Listen for his breathing, she told herself, but there was nothing. She gave it another moment, then put her stick aside and resumed her work. If I had my eyes, I could beat him bloody. One day the kindly man would give them back, and she would show them all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没谁能欺负我。”女孩手脚并用在地上爬，直到找到了她的手杖，她才带着满身伤痕和尘土站了起来。地窖寂静无声，他走了。或许没走？现在正站在她旁边？她没办法知道。仔细寻找他的呼吸声，她对自己说，然而什么声音都没有。她等了一会，然后把手杖收起来，继续刚才的工作。要是我能看到，我一定把他打的浑身是血。终有一天慈祥之人会让我恢复光明，我一定会给刚才这人颜色看看。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She had said as much to the kindly man. "And are you a god, to decide who should live and who should die?" he asked her. "We give the gift to those marked by Him of Many Faces, after prayers and sacrifice. So has it always been, from the beginning. I have told you of the founding of our order, of how the first of us answered the prayers of slaves who wished for death. The gift was given only to those who yearned for it, in the beginning… but one day, the first of us heard a slave praying not for his own death but for his master's. So fervently did he desire this that he offered all he had, that his prayer might be answered. And it seemed to our first brother that this sacrifice would be pleasing to Him of Many Faces, so that night he granted the prayer. Then he went to the slave and said, 'You offered all you had for this man's death, but slaves have nothing but their lives. That is what the god desires of you. For the rest of your days on earth, you will serve him.' And from that moment, we were two." His hand closed around her arm, gently but firmly. "All men must die. We are but death's instruments, not death himself. When you slew the singer, you took god's powers on yourself. We kill men, but we do not presume to judge them. Do you understand?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她也是这样对慈祥之人说的。“你是神么？可以决定谁可以活谁必须死？”他问她。“我们在祈祷和祭祀之后，赐予被千面之神选中的人以恩赐。从最开始我们就一直是这样做的。我告诉过你我们的使命是如何开始的，我们中的第一个是如何回应盼望死亡的奴隶的祈祷的。最初恩赐只赐予渴求死亡的人。但是有一天，我们中的第一个听到一名奴隶不是祈祷自己的而是他主人的死亡。他热切的渴望祈祷得到回应，为此愿意付出他的一切。在我们中的第一个看来，这种牺牲能够取悦千面之神，所以在那个夜晚他回应了奴隶的祈祷。之后他找到奴隶，对他说‘你愿意为这人的死付出你的一切，但奴隶除了生命一无所有。你的余生都将为千面之神服务，这就是他向你所要求的。’从那之后，我们就有了两个人。”慈祥之人握着她的手臂，轻柔却坚定。“凡人皆有一死，我们只是死亡的工具而不是死亡本身。当取歌手性命的时候，你用的是千面之神的力量。我们取人性命，但是我们没有资格去评价他们，明白吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That evening, after supper and a short session of the lying game, the blind girl tied a strip of rag around her head to hide her useless eyes, found her begging bowl, and asked the waif to help her don Beth's face. The waif had shaved her head for her when they took her eyes; a mummer's cut, she called it, since many mummers did the same so their wigs might fit them better. But it worked for beggars too and helped to keep their heads free from fleas and lice. More than a wig was needed, though. "I could cover you with weeping sores," the waif said, "but then innkeeps and taverners would chase you from their doors." Instead she gave her pox scars and a mummer's mole on one cheek with a dark hair growing from it. "Is it ugly?" the blind girl asked.</div>

She scratched his head behind one ear, and the cat jumped up into her lap and began to purr. Braavos was full of cats, and no place more than Pynto's. The old pirate believed they brought good luck and kept his tavern free of vermin. "You know me, don't you?" she whispered. Cats were not fooled by a mummer's moles. They remembered Cat of the Canals.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="今晚她很幸运，小酒馆几乎是空的，她要了火边的一个安静小角落，刚刚双腿交叉坐下，就感觉到有东西从她大腿上擦过。“又是你呀”盲眼女孩说。她挠了挠他耳朵后面，猫就跳到她腿上来，发出满足的呜呜声。布拉佛斯到处都是猫，尤其Pynto的店里最多。老海盗相信猫能带来好运，还能帮他的酒馆除去老鼠。“你认识我，是吗？”她低声说。猫们才不会被丑角的痣蒙骗呢，它们记得运河上的猫儿。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Beth did her begging at a different place every night. She had learned early on that innkeeps and taverners were more apt to tolerate her presence if it was not a frequent occurrence. Last night she had spent outside the Inn of the Green Eel, so tonight she turned right instead of left after the Bloody Bridge and made her way to Pynto's at the other end of Ragman's Harbor, right on the edge of the Drowned Town. Loud and smelly he might be, but Pynto had a soft heart under all his unwashed clothes and bluster. Oft as not, he would let her come inside where it was warm if the place was not too crowded, and now and again he might even let her have a mug of ale and a crust of food whilst regaling her with his stories. In his younger days Pynto had been the most notorious pirate in the Step-stones, to hear him tell it; he loved nothing better than to speak at great length about his exploits.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="贝丝每晚都在不同的地方乞讨，她很早就明白只要她的出现不是那么频繁，一般客栈的门房或酒店的老板就更容易容忍她的存在。她昨天晚上呆在绿色鳗鱼客栈外面，因此今天经过血桥之后她向右转（而不是向左）打算去旧衣贩码头的另一边的Pynto的店转转。尽管嗓门大而且有股臭味，但在他的咆哮声和从来不洗的脏衣服之下，Pynto有颗善良的心。经常在店里不挤的时候，他会允许她进去取暖，时不时的他还会给她一杯啤酒、一盘食物，还会对她讲他的故事。听Pynto自己讲，他年轻的时候是石阶群岛最臭名昭著的海盗，现在最喜欢的就是跟人讲他过去的辉煌事迹。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a good night for the blind girl. Pynto was in a jolly mood and gave her a cup of watered wine, a chunk of stinky cheese, and half of an eel pie. "Pynto is a very good man," he announced, then settled down to tell her of the time he seized the spice ship, a tale she had heard a dozen times before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对盲女孩来说，这是一个美好的夜晚，Pynto今天心情不错，给了她一杯兑水的葡萄酒，一大块臭奶酪和半个鳗鱼派。“Pynto是个很好的人”他宣布，然后又坐下来抓着她跟她讲他掳获香料船的事迹，这些故事她已经听过几十遍了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As the hours passed the tavern filled. Pynto was soon too busy to pay her any mind, but several of his regulars dropped coins into her begging bowl. Other tables were occupied by strangers: Ibbenese whalers who reeked of blood and blubber, a pair of bravos with scented oil in their hair, a fat man out of Lorath who complained that Pynto's booths were too small for his belly. And later three Lyseni, sailors off the Goodheart, a storm-wracked galley that had limped into Braavos last night and been seized this morning by the Sealord's guards.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随着时间的流逝酒馆里人渐渐满了起来，Pynto很快就忙的不可开交不会再注意盲女孩，但他的一些常客会往她的讨饭碗里丢一些硬币。一些桌前坐着的是陌生人：满是血和油脂味道的伊班捕鲸者；两个头发里抹了香精的布拉佛斯人；一个来自罗拉斯的胖子抱怨Pynto的桌位对他的肚子来说太窄；最后是三个里斯人，他们是好心人号上的水手，船在暴风雨中受损严重，昨天才缓慢的驶到布拉佛斯，今天早上被海王手下的人扣押。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Lyseni took the table nearest to the fire and spoke quietly over cups of black tar rum, keeping their voices low so no one could overhear. But she was no one and she heard most every word. And for a time it seemed that she could see them too, through the slitted yellow eyes of the tomcat purring in her lap. One was old and one was young and one had lost an ear, but all three had the white-blond hair and smooth fair skin of Lys, where the blood of the old Freehold still ran strong.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="里斯人坐在离火最近的一张桌子，一边喝黑朗姆酒一边轻声交谈。他们压低了声音这样就没有人（no one）可以听到他们在谈什么了，但盲眼女孩恰恰就是那个“没有人”（no one），所以她几乎听到了他们说的每一个字。一度她好像能够通过腿上呜呜叫的公猫那小小的黄眼睛看到这三个里斯人。他们一个老、一个年轻、还有一个少了只耳朵，他们三个都有着浅亚麻色的头发和里斯人特有的光滑白皙的皮肤，这是他们继承自古自由堡垒的血统。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I know where the slaves came from. They were wildlings from West-eros, from a place called Hardhome. An old ruined place, accursed." Old Nan had told her tales of Hardhome, back at Winterfell when she had still been Arya Stark. "After the big battle where the King-Beyond-the-Wall was killed, the wildlings ran away, and this woods witch said that if they went to Hardhome, ships would come and carry them away to someplace warm. But no ships came, except these two Lyseni pirates, Goodheart and Elephant, that had been driven north by a storm. They dropped anchor off Hardhome to make repairs, and saw the wildlings, but there were thousands and they didn't have room for all of them, so they said they'd just take the women and the children. The wildlings had nothing to eat, so the men sent out their wives and daughters, but as soon as the ships were out to sea, the Lyseni drove them below and roped them up. They meant to sell them all in Lys. Only then they ran into another storm and the ships were parted. The Goodheart was so damaged her captain had no choice but to put in here, but the Elephant may have made it back to Lys. The Lyseni at Pynto's think that she'll return with more ships. The price of slaves is rising, they said, and there are thousands more women and children at Hardhome."</div>
