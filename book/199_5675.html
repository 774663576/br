<div class="line_en">They were soon caught up in the crowds now flooding out of the stadium and back to their campsites. Raucous singing was borne toward them on the night air as they retraced their steps along the lantern-lit path, and leprechauns kept shooting over their heads, cackling and waving their lanterns. When they finally reached the tents, nobody felt like sleeping at all, and given the level of noise around them, Mr. Weasley agreed that they could all have one last cup of cocoa together before turning in. They were soon arguing enjoyably about the match; Mr. Weasley got drawn into a disagreement about cobbing with Charlie, and it was only when Ginny fell asleep right at the tiny table and spilled hot chocolate all over the floor that Mr. Weasley called a halt to the verbal replays and insisted that everyone go to bed. Hermione and Ginny went into the next tent, and Harry and the rest of the Weasleys changed into pajamas and clambered into their bunks. From the other side of the campsite they could still hear much singing and the odd echoing bang.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="很快，离开体育馆返回营地的潮水般的人群就把他们包围了。当他们顺着被灯笼照亮的通道往回走时，夜空里传来粗声粗气的歌声，小矮妖们不停地在他们头顶上穿梭飞驰，挥舞着手里的灯笼，嘎嘎欢笑。最后，终于到了帐篷边，可是谁也不想睡觉。考虑到周围实在太喧闹了，韦斯莱先生便同意大家喝完一杯可可奶再进帐篷。立刻，大家就为刚才比赛的事争论来。关于撞人犯规的问题，韦斯莱先生和查理争得不可开交。最后金妮在小桌边睡着了，把一杯热巧克力全洒在了地上，韦斯莱先生这才命令大家停止对比赛的争论，进去睡觉。赫敏和金妮钻进了旁边的帐篷，哈利和韦斯莱家的男孩们换上睡衣，爬向他们的铺位。这时，他们仍能听见营地另一边传来的歌声和奇怪的撞击声，在夜空里久久回响。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry, who was on a top bunk above Ron, lay staring up at the canvas ceiling of the tent, watching the glow of an occasional leprechaun lantern flying overhead, and picturing again some of Krum's more spectacular moves. He was itching to get back on his own Firebolt and try out the Wronski Feint… Somehow Oliver Wood had never managed to convey with all his wriggling diagrams what that move was supposed to look like… Harry saw himself in robes that had his name on the back, and imagined the sensation of hearing a hundred-thousand-strong crowd roar, as Ludo Bagman's voice echoed throughout the stadium, "I give you… Potter!"</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="隐隐约约地，他觉得事情有点不对劲儿。营地里的声音变了。歌声停止了，他听见了惊叫声和人们慌乱奔跑的声音。他从双人床上滑下来，伸手去拿衣服，可是韦斯莱先生说：“来不及了，哈利——随便抓一件外衣就出去吧，快点儿！”韦斯莱先生自己就是把牛仔服直接套在睡衣上的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">By the light of the few fires that were still burning, he could see people running away into the woods, fleeing something that was moving across the field toward them, something that was emitting odd flashes of light and noises like gunfire. Loud jeering, roars of laughter, and drunken yells were drifting toward them; then came a burst of strong green light, which illuminated the scene.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就着仍在燃烧的几堆火的火光，哈利看见人们纷纷朝树林里跑去，好像在逃避某个在营地上向他们移动的东西。那东西古怪地闪着光，还发出像打枪一般的声音。响亮的讥笑声、狂笑声、醉醺醺的叫嚷声，也都向他们移动过来。接着，一道绿色的强光一闪，照亮了周围的一切。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A crowd of wizards, tightly packed and moving together with wands pointing straight upward, was marching slowly across the field. Harry squinted at them… They didn't seem to have faces… Then he realized that their heads were hooded and their faces masked. High above them, floating along in midair, four struggling figures were being contorted into grotesque shapes. It was as though the masked wizards on the ground were puppeteers, and the people above them were marionettes operated by invisible strings that rose from the wands into the air. Two of the figures were very small.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一群巫师紧紧挤作一团，每个人都把手里的魔杖向上指着，一起向前推进，慢慢地在场地上移动。哈利眯着眼睛仔细打量着…这些人似乎没有面孔…接着他才反应过来，他们的脑袋上戴着兜帽，脸上蒙着面罩。在他们头顶上方，四个挣扎着的人影在空中飘浮，被扭曲成各种怪异的形状，就好像地面上这些蒙面巫师是操纵木偶的人，而他们上方的那几个人是牵线木偶，被从魔杖里冒向空中的无形的绳子控制着。其中两个人影很小。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The floating people were suddenly illuminated as they passed over a burning tent and Harry recognized one of them: Mr. Roberts, the campsite manager. The other three looked as though they might be his wife and children.

<div class="line_cn" title="当空中飘浮的那几个人从燃烧的帐篷上经过、被火光突然照亮时，哈利认出了其中的一个是营地管理员罗伯茨先生。另外三个看样子是他的妻子和孩子。下面的一个游行者用魔杖把罗伯茨夫人掉了个头朝下。罗伯茨夫人的睡衣垂落下来，露出一大堆花花哨哨的内裤，下面的人群开心地尖叫、起哄，她挣扎着想把自己的身体盖住。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">More wizards were joining the marching group, laughing and pointing up at the floating bodies. Tents crumpled and fell as the marching crowd swelled.

<div class="line_en">"C'mon," said Fred, grabbing Ginny's hand and starting to pull her toward the wood. Harry, Ron, Hermione, and George followed. They all looked back as they reached the trees. The crowd beneath the Roberts family was larger than ever; they could see the Ministry wizards trying to get through it to the hooded wizards in the center, but they were having great difficulty. It looked as though they were scared to perform any spell that might make the Roberts family fall.</div>

<div class="line_en">"The point?" said Mr. Weasley with a hollow laugh. "Harry, that's their idea of fun. Half the Muggle killings back when You-Know-Who was in power were done for fun. I suppose they had a few drinks tonight and couldn't resist reminding us all that lots of them are still at large. A nice little reunion for them," he finished disgustedly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“意义？”韦斯莱先生干笑了一声，说道，“哈利，那就是他们作乐的方式。过去神秘人当道的时候，他们杀害麻瓜一半都是为了取乐。我猜想他们今晚多喝了几杯酒，就忍不住想提醒我们一下：他们还有很多人在外逍遥。他们搞了一次愉快的小聚会。”他厌恶地说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We can't prove it was them, Bill," said Mr. Weasley. "Though it probably was," he added hopelessly.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yeah, I bet it was!" said Ron suddenly. "Dad, we met Draco Malfoy in the woods, and he as good as told us his dad was one of those nutters in masks! And we all know the Malfoys were right in with You-Know-Who!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对，我猜肯定是这样！”罗恩突然说道，“爸爸，我们在树林里遇见了德拉科·马尔福，他实际上差不多告诉了我们，他爸爸就是那些蒙面疯子当中的一个！我们都知道马尔福一家以前和神秘人很有交情！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Your guess is as good as ours, Hermione," said Mr. Weasley. "But I'll tell you this… it was only the Death Eaters who ever knew how to conjure it. I'd be very surprised if the person who did it hadn't been a Death Eater once, even if they're not now… Listen, it's very late, and if your mother hears what's happened she'll be worried sick. We'll get a few more hours sleep and then try and get an early Portkey out of here."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们也是这样猜想的，赫敏，”韦斯莱先生说，“不过我要告诉你们一点…只有食死徒才知道怎样变出那个标记。我可以肯定，变出标记的人以前准是一个食死徒，尽管现在也放不是了…听着，时间已经很晚了，如果你们的妈妈听说了这些事情，肯定会担心得要命。我们抓紧时间睡几个小时，然后早早地弄到门钥匙，离开这里。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Use your brains, Ron," said Bill. "If they really were Death Eaters, they worked very hard to keep out of Azkaban when You-Know-Who lost power, and told all sorts of lies about him forcing them to kill and torture people. I bet they'd be even more frightened than the rest of us to see him come back. They denied they'd ever been involved with him when he lost his powers, and went back to their daily lives… I don't reckon he'd be over-pleased with them, do you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你动脑子想一想吧，罗恩，”比尔说，“如果他们真是食死徒，神秘人失势之后，他们就会千方百计设法别被关进阿兹卡班，并编造各种谎话，说当初是神秘人强迫他们杀害和折磨别人的。我敢打赌，他们比我们这些人更害怕看见他回来。神秘人倒台后，他们百般否认自己跟他有关系，又重新过上了正常人的生活…我认为神秘人对他们不会很满意，你说呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But if they were the Death Eaters, why did they Disapparate when they saw the Dark Mark?" said Ron. "They'd have been pleased to see it, wouldn't they?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可是如果他们就是食死徒，为什么一看见黑魔标记就幻影移形了呢？”罗恩问，“他们应该很高兴看见它呀，对不对？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"So… whoever conjured the Dark Mark…" said Hermione slowly, "were they doing it to show support for the Death Eaters, or to scare them away?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那么…变出黑魔标记的人…”赫敏慢慢地说，“这么做到底是为了表示支持食死徒，还是要把他们吓跑呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry got back into his bunk with his head buzzing. He knew he ought to feel exhausted: It was nearly three in the morning, but he felt wide-awake -- wide-awake, and worried.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利爬回到他的双层术上，脑袋里嗡嗡作响。他知道他应该感到精疲力竭才是：现在已是凌晨三点，可是他却感到异常清醒——清醒，而且担忧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He thought of the letter he had written to Sirius before leaving Privet Drive. Would Sirius have gotten it yet? When would he reply? Harry lay looking up at the canvas, but no flying fantasies came to him now to ease him to sleep, and it was a long time after Charlie's snores filled the tent that Harry finally dozed off.</div>
