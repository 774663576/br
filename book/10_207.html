<div class="line_en">In the meanwhile, the dwarves sat in darkness, and utter silence fell about them. Little they ate and little they spoke. They could not count the passing of time; and they scarcely dared to move, for the whisper of their voices echoed and rustled in the tunnel. If they dozed, they woke still to darkness and to silence going on unbroken. At last after days and days of waiting, as it seemed, when they were becoming choked and dazed for want of air, they could bear it no longer. They would almost have welcomed sounds from below of the dragon's return. In the silence they feared some cunning devilry of his, but they could not sit there for ever.</div>

<div class="line_en">Thorin spoke: "Let us try the door!" he said. "I must feel the wind on my face soon or die. I think I would rather be smashed by Smaug in the open than suffocate in here!" So several of the dwarves got up and groped back to where the door had been. But they found that the upper end of the tunnel had been shattered and blocked with broken rock. Neither key nor the magic it had once obeyed would ever open that door again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="索林开口了，“我们来试试把门打开吧！”他说，“我如果再不吹点风就要闷死了。我想我宁愿在光天化日下被史矛革打死，也不愿意在这里活活憋死！”几个矮人听他这么一说都站了起来，往回摸到了石门原先所在的位置。但他们发现，隧道的上端已经被碎石震坍塞住了。所以，它原先所听命的魔法或是钥匙，都再也不能将其打开了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Come, come!" he said. "'While there's life there's hope!' as my father used to say, and 'Third time pays for all.' I am going down the tunnel once again. I have been that way twice, when I knew there was a dragon at the other end, so I will risk a third visit when I am no longer sure. Anyway the only way out is down. And I think this time you had better all come with me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好啦。，好啦！”他说，“‘只要还活着，就有希望。’这是我父亲常说的话，他还老说‘事不过三’呢。我准备再下去一趟。在我知道那里有恶龙的时候，我都已经去了两次了呢，现在我吃不准他在不在了，再下去一次又有何妨。再怎么说，惟一的出路也只能是往下了。这次，我想你们最好跟我一起去吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Down, down they went. The dwarves could not, of course, compare with the hobbit in real stealth, and they made a deal of puffing and shuffling which echoes magnified alarmingly; but though every now and again Bilbo in fear stopped and listened, not a sound stirred below. Near the bottom, as well as he could judge, Bilbo slipped on his ring and went ahead. But he did not need it: the darkness was complete, and they were all invisible, ring or no ring. In fact so black was it that the hobbit came to the opening unexpectedly, put his hand on air, stumbled forward, and rolled headlong into the hall!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们一路往下走着。矮人们在走路不出声方面当然没法跟霍比特人比，他们的喘气声和脚步声都被隧道里面的回声放得很大。虽然比尔博时不时地因为担心而停下脚步来凝神倾听，但底下并没有被激起任何声响来。快到最底下的时候，比尔博根据自己的判断戴上了戒指，继续走了过去。但其实他并不需要用到戒指：那里一团漆黑，不管戴没戴戒指，大家谁都看不见谁。事实上，由于底下实在太黑了，比尔博竟然没料到自己已经来到了洞口，双手抓了个空，一下向前跌倒，从洞口一骨碌滚进了大厅！">查看中文翻译</div>

There was not a gleam of light-unless, as it seemed to him, when at last he slowly raised his head, there was a pale white glint, above him and far off in the gloom.

<div class="line_en">After a while a twinkling gleam showed them returning, Oin with a small pine-torch alight in his hand, and Gloin with a bundle of others under his arm. Quickly Bilbo trotted to the door and took the torch; but he could not persuade the dwarves to light the others or to come and join him yet. As Thorin carefully explained, Mr. Baggins was still officially their expert burglar and investigator. If he liked to risk a light, that was his affair. They would wait in the tunnel for his report. So they sat near the door and watched.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="又过了一阵子，一道摇曳的微光和他们一起回来了，欧因手里拿着一个小小的松枝火把，格罗因则在腋下夹着一堆同样的火把。比尔博赶紧跑到门边接过火把，但他却无法说服其他矮人和他一样点起火把来。索林小心翼翼地解释说，巴金斯先生依旧是队伍中名正言顺的飞贼和侦察员，如果他想要冒险点火，那是他自己的事，他们会等在隧道里面等待他回来报告。于是他们就在门边坐了下来，小心翼翼地观望着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The dwarves, of course, were very alarmed when Bilbo fell forward down the step with a bump into the hall, and they sat huddled just where he had left them at the end of the tunnel.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“嘘！嘘！”当他们听见比尔博的声音时，便发出这样的声音与比尔博联络。虽然这的确帮助霍比特人得到了他们的位置，比尔博还是花了一点时间才从他们那里得到了一点别的东西。不过最后，等比尔博真的开始拼命跺脚，扯开他那尖嗓子大喊“来点光！”的时候，索林终于让步了，派欧因和格罗因到隧道另一头去取他们的行李。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They saw the little dark shape of the hobbit start across the floor holding his tiny light aloft. Every now and again, while he was still near enough, they caught a glint and a tinkle as he stumbled on some golden thing. The light grew smaller as he wandered away into the vast hall; then it began to rise dancing into the air. Bilbo was climbing the great mound of treasure. Soon he stood upon the top, and still went on. Then they saw him halt and stoop for a moment; but they did not know the reason.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们看见霍比特人小小的黑色身影高举着小火把朝大厅深处走去。在他还没走远的时候，矮人们借着一点微光和一声“当啷”，发现比尔博不小心踢到了地上某样金灿灿的东西。随着他渐渐走进幽深的大厅，光点变得越来越小，然后光点开始向上，在半空中舞动，原来比尔博正在往一大堆金银财宝上爬去。很快，他就站上了财宝堆的顶端，接着又继续向前。这时，他们看见他停住了脚步，弯下腰来检查了片刻，但他们都不知道他这样做究竟原因何在。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was the Arkenstone, the Heart of the Mountain. So Bilbo guessed from Thorin's description; but indeed there could not be two such gems, even in so marvellous a hoard, even in all the world. Ever as he climbed, the same white gleam had shone before him and drawn his feet towards it. Slowly it grew to a little globe of pallid light. Now as he came near, it was tinged with a flickering sparkle of many colours at the surface, reflected and splintered from the wavering light of his torch. At last he looked down upon it, and he caught his breath. The great jewel shone before his feet of its own inner light, and yet, cut and fashioned by the dwarves, who had dug it from the heart of the mountain long ago, it took all light that fell upon it and changed it into ten thousand sparks of white radiance shot with glints of the rainbow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那是因为比尔博发现了阿肯宝钻，那颗山之心！他是从索林的描述中作出判断的，不过事实上，即便是在这里这么一大堆让人眼花缭乱的宝藏中，不，即便是在全世界，都不可能存在两颗符合这般描述的宝石来。他不停地往上爬，一道不变的白色光芒一直在他的前方闪烁，吸引着他的脚步。慢慢地，那光芒化成了一个纯净白光的小球。他又走近了一点，宝石的表面在他手中火把的映照下，发散出一道由许多颜色构成的光晕。最后，他走到宝石跟前，屏住呼吸，细细端详。这颗无双的宝石在他的脚下由内而外地闪耀着属于它自己的光芒。但另一方面，在多年前将其从山底下挖出来的矮人们的精雕细琢下，它又能将所有落到它身上的光亮幻化成千万道白色的光线，投射出彩虹般的光芒。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Now he went on again. Down the other side of the great mound he climbed, and the spark of his torch vanished from the sight of the watching dwarves. But soon they saw it far away in the distance again. Bilbo was crossing the floor of the hall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他又接着往前走，从宝山的另外一边爬了下去，手中火把的光亮从矮人们的视野中消失了。不过很快，他们又看到火光出现在更远的地方。比尔博正在横穿整个大厅。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Suddenly Bilbo's arm went towards it drawn by its enchantment. His small hand would not close about it, for it was a large and heavy gem; but he lifted it, shut his eyes, and put it in his deepest pocket.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然，在它的魅力吸引下，比尔博的手臂不由自主地向它伸去，将它拿了起来。他的小手甚至没办法将它完全握住，因为这是一颗硕大而又沉重的宝石，但他还是将它捧了起来，闭上眼睛，然后将其放进了最贴身的口袋里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Now I am a burglar indeed!" thought he. "But I suppose I must tell the dwarves about it-some time. They did say I could pick and choose my own share; and I think I would choose this, if they took all the rest!" All the same he had an uncomfortable feeling that the picking and choosing had not really been meant to include this marvellous gem, and that trouble would yet come of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我现在可成为一个真正的飞贼了！”他想，“不过我想我应该跟矮人们说一下——等有时间吧。他们不是说过我那一份可以自己挑吗，那我就选这个，让他们分其余的吧！”不过他也多少有点不安，感到矮人们所说的自行挑选，恐怕不包括这颗璀璨夺目的宝石，自己这么拿了或许会惹上麻烦。。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He went on, until he came to the great doors at the further side, and there a draught of air refreshed him, but it almost puffed out his light. He peeped timidly through, and caught a glimpse of great passages and of the dim beginnings of wide stairs going up into the gloom. And still there was no sight nor sound of Smaug. He was just going to turn and go back, when a black shape swooped at him, and brushed his face. He squeaked and started, stumbled backwards and fell. His torch dropped head downwards and went out!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他继续往前走，最后来到了远端的大门前，扑面而来的一股新鲜空气让他觉得神清气爽，却也差点将他的火把弄灭。他小心地朝外张去，看见外面有相当宽敞的走廊，还有通往上方昏暗中去的宽阔阶梯的最初几级。到目前为止，史矛革的身影或声音还是没有出现。他正准备转身回去时，一个黑影突然向他俯冲过来，擦过他的脸飞了过去。他尖叫一声，瞪大了眼睛，向后跌倒在地，手中火把头朝地落了下去，立刻熄灭了！">查看中文翻译</div>

All were now eager to explore the hall while they had the chance, and willing to believe that, for the present, Smaug was away from home. Each now gripped a lighted torch; and as they gazed, first on one side and then on another, they forgot fear and even caution. They spoke aloud, and cried out to one another, as they lifted old treasures from the mound or from the wall and held them in the light, caressing and fingering them.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Only a bat and a dropped torch, nothing worse!" he said in answer to their questions. Though they were much relieved, they were inclined to be grumpy at being frightened for nothing; but what they would have said, if he had told them at that moment about the Arkenstone, I don't know. The mere fleeting glimpses of treasure which they had caught as they went along had rekindled all the fire of their dwarvish hearts; and when the heart of a dwarf, even the most respectable, is wakened by gold and by jewels, he grows suddenly bold, and he may become fierce.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“只是一只蝙蝠，火把掉了，没什么大不了的！”他回答了他们的问踢。虽然他们听了大大松了口气，却也为这一场虚惊而发了几句牢骚。我不知道如果他当时就把阿肯宝钻的事情告诉了矮人们，他们会说些什么。他们向前走着，一路上瞥见的财宝重新又点燃了矮人们心中的火焰。而当矮人们的心思被黄金和珠宝唤醒后，即使原来是一个最可尊敬的人，也会突然变得胆大包天，甚至是相当凶狠起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Fili and Kili were almost in merry mood, and finding still hanging there many golden harps strung with silver they took them and struck them; and being magical (and also untouched by the dragon, who had small interest in music) they were still in tune. The dark hall was filled with a melody that had long been silent. But most of the dwarves were more practical: they gathered gems and stuffed their pockets, and let what they could not carry fall back through their fingers with a sigh. Thorin was not least among these; but always he searched from side to side for something which he could not find. It was the Arkenstone; but he spoke of it yet to no one.</div>

Long before the dwarves were tired of examining the treasures, he became weary of it and sat down on the floor; and he began to wonder nervously what the end of it all would be. "I would give a good many of these precious goblets," he thought, "for a drink of something cheering out of one of Beorn's wooden bowls!"</div>

<div class="line_en">Though all the old adornments were long mouldered or destroyed, and though all was befouled and blasted with the comings and goings of the monster, Thorin knew every passage and every turn. They climbed long stairs, and turned and went down wide echoing ways, and turned again and climbed yet more stairs, and yet more stairs again. These were smooth, cut out of the living rock broad and fair; and up, up, the dwarves went, and they met no sign of any living thing, only furtive shadows that fled from the approach of their torches fluttering in the draughts.</div>

<div class="line_en">Out of a dark opening in a wall of rock there issued a boiling water, and it flowed swirling in a narrow channel, carved and made straight and deep by the cunning of ancient hands. Beside it ran a stone-paved road, wide enough for many men abreast. Swiftly along this they ran, and round a wide-sweeping turn-and behold! before them stood the broad light of day. In front there rose a tall arch, still showing the fragments of old carven work within, worn and splintered and blackened though it was. A misty sun sent its pale light between the arms of the Mountain, and beams of gold fell on the pavement at the threshold.</div>

<div class="line_en">Under the rocky wall to the right there was no path, so on they trudged among the stones on the left side of the river, and the emptiness and desolation soon sobered even Thorin again. The bridge that Balin had spoken of they found long fallen, and most of its stones were now only boulders in the shallow noisy stream; but they forded the water without much difficulty, and found the ancient steps, and climbed the high bank. After going a short way they struck the old road, and before long came to a deep dell sheltered among the rocks; there they rested for a while and had such a breakfast as they could, chiefly cram and water. (If you want to know what cram is, I can only say that I don't know the recipe; but it is biscuitish, keeps good indefinitely, is supposed to be sustaining, and is certainly not entertaining, being in fact very uninteresting except as a chewing exercise. It was made by the Lake-men for long journeys.)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="沿着山壁往右边走是没有路的，因此，他们是在河流左岸的乱石间脚步沉重地走着。荒凉的、光秃秃的环境很快就让大家严肃起来，即使索林也不例外。他们发现巴林提到过的那座桥早就已经塌了，造桥用的石头现在成了躺在喧闹浅溪中的卵石。不过，他们还是没费多少力气就渡过了河水，顺利找到了古老的阶梯，爬上了高高的河岸。走了一小段之后，他们踏上了那条古代留下的道路，不久就来到了一处岩石围成的幽谷。他们在这里休息了一会儿，倾其所有地吃了一顿早餐，主要是克拉姆和水。（如果你想要知道克拉姆是什么东西，我只能告诉你，我也不知道它的配方，不过它吃起来有点饼干的味道，可以保存很长的时间，吃了很耐饥，味道当然不敢恭维，事实上它吃起来很没味道，像是一种纯粹的口腔咀嚼练习。长湖边的人类制作这种干粮是专供长途旅行时用的。）">查看中文翻译</div>

Still, here we can now lie hid and sheltered for a while, and can see much without being seen."</div>

It was quite deserted; not even wild animals seemed to have used it in all the days of Smaug's dominion. There they laid their burdens; and some threw themselves down at once and slept, but the others sat near the outer door and discussed their plans. In all their talk they came perpetually back to one thing: where was Smaug? They looked West and there was nothing, and East there was nothing, and in the South there was no sign of the dragon, but there was a gathering of very many birds. At that they gazed and wondered; but they were no nearer understanding it, when the first cold stars came out.</div>
