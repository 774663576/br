<div class="line_cn" title="爸爸眼睛在他们两个身上，来回看，好像在研究他们，又好像是头一次见到他们一样。他面无表情，就像机器人一样，看不出有丝毫的感情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This wasn't like him. Not at all. He was always a very direct person, Margaret thought. If he was angry, he said he was angry. If he was upset, he'd tell them he was upset.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这不像爸爸，一点也不像。爸爸总是很坦率。玛格丽特想。如果他生气，他会告诉他们。如果他难过，他也会说他很难过。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"But can't you take us down there and tell us what you're doing?" Casey asked. He still hadn't put the T-shirt on. He was holding it in a ball between his hands on the kitchen table.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“爸爸，你就不能带我们下去，告诉我们你在做什么吗？”凯西问道。他没穿T恤衫，双手把它握成一团，放在厨房桌上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Casey raised his eyes to Margaret and shrugged. Their father reappeared carrying the lab coat he had tossed over the front banister.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凯西抬眼看了看玛格丽特，耸了耸肩。爸爸拿着刚才扔在前面扶栏上的工作服又回到他们面前。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He nodded. "I guess." He pulled on the lab coat over his head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爸爸点点头。“应该吧。”他把工作服从头上套下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Some day," their father said. He returned the chair to all four legs and then stood up. "We'll do it soon, okay?" He raised his arms above his head and stretched. "I've got to get back to work." He disappeared into the front hallway.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“改天吧，”爸爸说着，直了直身子，椅子恢复到了四脚着地状态。他站起身来，“我过几天就带你们下去，好吗？”他把胳膊举过头顶，伸了伸懒腰。“我要回去工作了，”说完便消失在前屋走廊里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yeah. We'd really like to understand it," Margaret added enthusiastically.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“爸爸，我们真的很想知道，”玛格丽特急切地附和着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我告诉过你们不要去地下室，”他平静地说道，双臂交叉向后靠着。椅子的两条前腿离了地。“我想我已经说得很清楚了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dr. Brewer's reply was muffled as he adjusted the lab coat and straightened the collar. "Later," he said. He disappeared into the hallway. They heard him shut the basement door behind him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布鲁尔博士整理了一下工作服，拉直了领子，嘴里咕哝着回应了一句：“回头见。”说完便消失在走廊里。他们听见他关上了地下室的门。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I guess," Casey said. "He sure is acting… weird."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我觉得不会，”凯西说，“但他真有点古怪。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I can't believe that plant grabbed me," Casey said thoughtfully, not budging.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我真不敢相信，植物抓住了我，”凯西若有所思地说，但他没动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Maybe he's upset because Mom is gone," Margaret said. She sat up and gave Casey a push. "Come on. Get up. I've got work to do."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“或许是因为妈妈走了他感到不愉快，”玛格丽特说着，站起来，推了凯西一下，“嗨，起来，我还有事要做。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She went up to her room, thinking about how she missed her mother already. Then the scene in the basement with Casey trying to pull himself free of the enormous, twining plant tendrils played once again through her mind.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“那就是说，您不会很快回家喽，”玛格丽特难过地说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well… yes," Margaret admitted. She raised her eyes to the bedroom window. Two sparrows had landed outside on the window ledge and were chattering excitedly, distracting Margaret, making it hard to hear her mother over the crackling line from Tucson.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，我真的很想你”玛格丽特承认了。她抬眼看了看窗户。有两只麻雀落在了窗台上，叽叽喳喳地叫着。这分散了玛格丽特的注意力，电话里的劈啪声也很难让她听清妈妈的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"How's your father doing?" Mrs. Brewer asked. "I spoke to him last night, but he only grunted."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“比我们还重要吗？”玛格丽特大声反驳。她不喜欢自己说话时的烦躁语气。她希望自己没有在电话里抱怨爸爸。妈妈在医院担心的事情已经够多了。玛格丽特知道此刻不应该让妈妈感觉这么糟糕。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He's working really hard," Mrs. Brewer replied. In the background, Margaret could hear some kind of loudspeaker announcement. Her mother was calling from a pay phone at the hospital.</div>
