<div class="line_en">Winter passed, and spring returned to the river bank. Then came a fine morning in early summer, when the world seemed full of sunlight and new green leaves. Down by the river bank, the Mole and the Water Rat were hard at work, mending and cleaning boats, looking for lost oars, and getting ready for a summer on the river. Then they went in to breakfast and had nearly finished when they heard a heavy knock on the door.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="当他们到达蛤蟆宅第，他们看见这辆新车正停放在房子前。车身很长，锃亮耀眼，是蛤蟆最喜欢的艳红色。只见癞蛤蟆他自己穿着特大外套，戴着帽子和护目镜，正从台阶上走下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It wasn't easy to do. The Rat had to sit on Toad, while the Mole pulled off his overcoat, hat and goggles. And Toad called them some very unpleasant names while this was going on. But when he stood up again, he seemed more like himself, the Toad that they had always known.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这可不是件容易的事。水鼠不得不坐在癞蛤蟆身上压住他以便鼹鼠脱下他的外衣，帽子和护目镜。癞蛤蟆嘴里一直对他们骂骂咧咧的。但当他再次站起来时，他似乎更像他自己，更像大家所熟悉的癞蛤蟆了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After about an hour the door opened, and a very sad and sorry Toad came out, followed by the Badger.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大约过了一小时，门开了，一只很伤心、很愧疚的癞蛤蟆走了出来，獾跟在他的后面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He took Toad into a room off the hall and closed the door. The Rat shook his head. "We won't save Toad by just talking to him," he said. "He'll say anything -- and then just go and do what he likes."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他带癞蛤蟆离开大厅走进一个房间关上了门。水鼠摇着头，说：“仅仅跟他谈谈是救不了他的，他将会作一些许诺——然后又去干他喜欢干的事。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You knew this would happen one day, Toad," explained the Badger. "We've warned you so many times, and you haven't listened. You're spending all your money, you're always in trouble with the police, and you drive like a madman. You will come with me into the next room, and there you will hear some facts about yourself. And you will come out a different Toad."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你应该知道这件事总有一天会发生的，蛤蟆，”獾解释说。“我们警告过你多次而你从来不听。你正在花光你所有的钱财，又总是给警察找麻烦，因为你开车像疯子。你跟我到另一个房间去，在那儿你会听到你自己的一些荒唐事。你出来后将会变个样。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"My friends," said the Badger, looking pleased, "I' am happy to tell you that Toad now realizes how silly he has been. He has promised never to get into a motor-car again."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“朋友们，”獾看起来很开心，“我高兴地告诉你们癞蛤蟆现在已认识到他曾经有多愚蠢。他已发誓再也不走进汽车。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No!" said Toad suddenly. "No, I won't. I'm not sorry, and I haven't been silly at all. It was all wonderful! And I won't promise anything!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不！”癞蛤蟆突然说。“不，我不。我不感到愧疚，我一点儿也不愚蠢。那整个太精彩了！我才不发什么誓呢！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a long, long silence.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接下来是一段长长的沉默。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, yes, I know," said Toad quickly. "You argue so beautifully, dear Badger, and I can't stop myself agreeing with you. But I've been thinking about it. I love driving, I' m a wonderful driver, and I promise you I'll go on driving for ever! Poop -- poop!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，是的，我知道，”癞蛤蟆赶快说，“你说得那么至情至理，亲爱的獾，我就忍不住答应你了。但是我一直在想这个问题。我喜欢开车，我是了不起的驾车手，我发誓我将继续永远开车！扑扑—扑扑！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Very well," said the Badger. "If you won't listen to reason, we'll have to try another way. We're going to stay with you in your house until you become sensible. Take him upstairs, you two, and lock him in his bedroom."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“很好，”獾说，“如果你不听忠告，我们将不得不采取另一种方法。我们打算和你呆在你的屋里直到你清醒过来。带他上楼去，你们俩，把他锁在卧室里。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I told you so, didn't I?" the Rat said to the Mole.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我告诉过你吧，是不是？”水鼠对鼹鼠说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So Toad, fighting and shouting, was pulled upstairs by his two friends.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="癞蛤蟆又打又叫，但还是被他俩朋友拉上了楼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We'll take good care of you, Toad," added the Mole. "No more trouble with the police. No more crashes, and weeks in hospital."</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's for your own good, Toady, you know," said the Rat kindly. "We'll all have good times together again soon, when this -- this madness has passed."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这是为你好，蛤蟆兄，你知道，”水鼠和善地说。“当这种——这种疯狂过去时，我们又可以一起享受美好时光了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then began a very tiring few weeks for the three friends. Day and night they guarded Toad, and one of them was always with him. They talked to him and tried to amuse him, hoping that he would forget his motor-car madness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接下来三个朋友开始了几星期的辛苦行动。他们日夜看管着癞蛤蟆，并且总有一个人和他在一起。他们和他聊天，想方设法逗他开心，希望他会忘记他那驾车狂热。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A sad whisper came from me bed, "Thank you so much, dear Ratty! But how are you, and the excellent Mole, and dear old Badger?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从床上传来伤感的低低的回答声：“非常感谢你，亲爱的阿鼠！不过你怎么样，还有极好的鼹鼠和亲爱的老獾？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One day the Rat was the guard for the morning. He went upstairs and found Toad still in bed, "How are you today, old fellow?" he asked brightly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天早上，轮到水鼠看管癞蛤螅他走上楼看见癞蛤蟆仍躺在床上，便轻快地问：“今天怎么样，老伙计？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But Toad did not seem to get better. He often put the bed-room chairs together to look like a motor-car. Then he sat in the front one and pretended to drive, making terrible engine noises all the time. His friends tried to interest him in other things, but Toad just became sad and silent.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是癞蛤蟆似乎并没有变好。他时常把卧室里的椅子摆成汽车状，然后他坐在前面的椅子上假装开车，还不停地发出刺耳的引擎声。当他的朋友试着用别的事情以引起他的兴趣时，他却只是在那儿一言不发，显得很伤感。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Fine, fine," replied the Rat. "Badger and Mole," he added, perhaps not very sensibly, "have gone out for a run round. They'll be out until lunch-time, so you and I will spend a pleasant morning together."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好，都好，”水鼠答道。“獾和鼹鼠，”他也许不很明智地又补充说，“已出去跑步了，他们要到中饭时间才回来，所以就你和我将一起度过这个愉快的早上。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don't want you to trouble yourself about me," Toad said, in a sad little voice. "I was wondering if you would go down to the village and fetch the doctor. But no, it's not important. It's probably too late by now."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不想因为我而麻烦你，”蛤蟆伤心地低声说。“我想你能否下楼去村里找位医生。不过算了，这已不重要了。很可能现在已经太迟了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When Toad heard the front door bang, he jumped out of bed, laughing loudly. He quickly put on his best suit and filled his pockets with money. Then he took the sheets off the bed, tied them together, and in minutes he had climbed down from the bedroom window and was running across the garden towards the fields.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当癞蛤蟆听到大厅前门砰地一响，他马上从床上跳下来，大声地笑起来。他快速地穿上最好的外套并往口袋里塞满了钞票，然后他从床上扯过床单，把它们系在一起。几分钟后，他已从卧室的窗户爬了下来，穿过花园向野外跑去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Rat felt very worried. Toad lay so still and quiet -- perhaps he really was ill. The Rat wished that the other two were not so far away. What should he do? He looked again at the still and silent Toad, and decided that he must get th doctor at once. He hurried out, carefully locking the door behind him, and ran off to the village as fast as he could.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="水鼠非常担心，癞蛤蟆躺在那儿安安静静的，一动不动——也许他真的病了。水鼠希望他们俩没跑得太远，他该怎么办？他又看了一眼安静沉默的癞蛤蟆，决定马上去叫医生。他急忙出去小心地锁上了门，然后尽可能快地向村子跑去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don't know… I think my heart… But you mustn't be sad, Ratty. Dear, kind friend… I have enjoyed knowing you so much… hate to say goodbye…" Toad's whisper became slower and slower, and then stopped.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不知道……我想我的心……不过你不必伤心，阿鼠。亲爱的，善良的朋友……我真高兴跟你这么熟……真不愿对你说再见……”蛤蟆低低的声音越来越慢，然后停了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A few hours later he was a long way from home. As he walked happily along the road, he felt very pleased with himself. "A clever piece of work, that was!" he boasted to the trees and the fields. "Poor old Ratty! A good fellow, but not very intelligent. Badger will be so angry with him!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几小时以后，他已离家很远了。他高兴地走在公路上，对自己的行为非常满意。“那真是聪明之举！”他对着树木和田野自吹道。“可怜的老阿鼠！一个好人，但不太聪明。獾肯定要对他发火的！”">查看中文翻译</div>

Halfway through his meal, he heard a sound that he knew very well indeed. Poop -- poop! The car stopped outside and the people in it came into the pub to have lunch.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不久他来到了一座小镇，便决定在那儿的酒馆用午餐。走了那么长的路，他已经非常饿了。吃到半截，他听到了他实在是非常熟悉的声音。扑扑—扑扑！汽车停在了外面，车上的人下来走进酒馆来用餐。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Shaking with excitement, Toad paid his bill and hurried out. He walked slowly round the car, looking at it lovingly. Everybody was having lunch and the street was empty.</div>
