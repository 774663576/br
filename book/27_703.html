<div class="line_en">In March, a month after I had started digging into the company, Theranos had closed another round of funding. Unbeknownst to me, the lead investor was Rupert Murdoch, the Australian-born media mogul who controlled the Journal's parent company, News Corporation. Of the more than $430 million Theranos had raised in this last round, $125 million had come from Murdoch. That made him the company's biggest investor.</div>

<div class="line_en">During the dinner, Holmes came over to Murdoch's table, introduced herself, and chatted him up. The strong first impression she made on him was bolstered by Milner, who sang her praises when Murdoch later asked him what he thought of the young woman.</div>

<div class="line_en">Murdoch was known to dabble in Silicon Valley startup investments. He'd been an early investor in Uber, turning a $150,000 bet into some $50 million. But unlike the big venture capital firms, he did no due diligence to speak of. The eighty-four-year-old mogul tended to just follow his gut, an approach that had served him well on his way to building one of the world's biggest media and entertainment empires. The one call he placed before investing in Theranos was to Toby Cosgrove, the CEO of the Cleveland Clinic. Holmes had mentioned that she was on the verge of announcing an alliance with the world-renowned heart center. Like Yuri Milner, Cosgrove had only good things to say when Murdoch reached him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="梅铎喜欢投资硅谷新创公司是众所皆知的事，他是优步早期投资人，当初的十五万美元投资后来变成五千万。不过他跟大型创投公司不同，他不做什么风险调查评估，这位八十四岁大亨倾向跟着自己的感觉走，这个方法帮助他一路创建起全世界最大的媒体娱乐王国之一。他在投资Theranos之前，只打了通电话给托比．寇斯葛洛夫（Toby Cosgrove），克里夫兰医学中心（Cleveland Clinic）首席执行官，因为霍姆斯提过她就快要宣布跟这家知名心脏权威机构合作。跟尤里．米尔纳一样，梅铎致电的时候，寇斯葛洛夫对霍姆斯只有溢美之词。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They met again a few weeks later at the media mogul's Northern California ranch. Murdoch, who had only one bodyguard, was surprised by the size of the security detail Holmes arrived with. When he asked her why she needed it, she replied that her board insisted on it. Over a lunch served by the ranch's staff, Holmes pitched Murdoch on an investment, emphasizing that she was looking for long-term investors. Don't expect any quarterly reports for a while, she warned him, and certainly not an initial public offering. The investment packet that was later delivered to Murdoch's Manhattan office reiterated that message. Its cover letter stated in the first paragraph that Theranos planned to remain private for the "long term" and went on to repeat those two words no fewer than fifteen times.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几个星期后他们再度碰面，这次地点在这位媒体大亨的北加州庄园。只有一个贴身保镳的梅铎，看到霍姆斯抵达时大阵仗的安全随扈，大为惊讶，他问她为什么需要这么多随扈，她回答这是董事会的坚持。享用牧场人员端上的午餐的同时，霍姆斯卖力鼓吹梅铎入股，她强调自己在寻找的是长期投资人，她警告他，短时间内不要期待看到任何季报，当然也不会有首次公开募股（IPO，编按：首次将公司股票卖给一般公众）。随后，送到梅铎曼哈顿办公室的投资文档再次重申了这点，首页第一段写着，Theranos计划「长期」维持私有、不上市，「长期」两个字在后面重复了不下十五次。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Theranos was by far the single biggest investment Murdoch had ever made outside of the media assets he controlled, which included the 20th Century Fox movie studio, the Fox broadcast network, and Fox News. He was won over by Holmes's charisma and vision but also by the financial projections she gave him. The investment packet she sent forecast $330 million in profits on revenues of $1 billion in 2015 and $505 million in profits on revenues of $2 billion in 2016. Those numbers made what was now a $10 billion valuation seem cheap.</div>

<div class="line_en">Murdoch also derived comfort from some of the other reputable investors he heard Theranos had lined up. They included Cox Enterprises, the Atlanta-based, family-owned conglomerate whose chairman, Jim Kennedy, he was friendly with, and the Waltons of Walmart fame. Other big-name investors he didn't know about ranged from Bob Kraft, owner of the New England Patriots, to Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim and John Elkann, the Italian industrialist who controlled Fiat Chrysler Automobiles.</div>

<div class="line_en">In late September, as we were getting close to publication, Holmes met with Murdoch a fourth time in his office on the eighth floor of the News Corporation building in Midtown Manhattan. My desk in the Journal's newsroom was just three floors below, but I had no idea she was on the premises. She brought up my story with renewed urgency, hoping Murdoch would offer to kill it. Once again, despite the substantial investment he had at stake, he declined to intervene.</div>

<div class="line_en">By the time Mike Siconolfi and I had our conversation about the ancient art of Sicilian fishing in late July, Holmes had had three private meetings with Murdoch. The latest had taken place earlier that month, when she'd hosted him in Palo Alto and showed him the miniLab. During the visit, she'd raised my story, telling him the information I had gathered was false and would do great damage to Theranos if it was published. Murdoch had demurred, saying he trusted the paper's editors to handle the matter fairly.</div>

<div class="line_en">While Tyler Shultz remained unreachable (I'd gotten his mother on the phone and left a message for him with her, to no avail), I assumed Theranos would have presented us with a signed statement similar to the ones from Drs. Rezaie and Beardsley if it had succeeded in making him recant. Besides, there was nothing it could do to make the emails he had given me disappear. Those spoke for themselves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然泰勒．舒兹依旧联系不上（我有跟他妈妈通上电话，并且留言请他妈妈转告，但仍然没有下文），不过我心想，如果Theranos对他策反成功，Theranos必定会拿着类似瑞札伊和比尔兹利医师所签的声明来给我们。更何况，Theranos也没办法让泰勒早就给我的电邮消失不见，那些电邮自己会说话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Boies Schiller's Mike Brille sent a letter to Rochelle Gibbons threatening to sue her if she didn't cease making what he termed "false and defamatory statements" about the company and its executives. In Phoenix, two new patients showed up for appointments at Dr. Sundene's office and threw tantrums. She had to hire an attorney to get Yelp to take down incendiary reviews they posted on the site about her. I had managed to keep Dr. Stewart from succumbing to Balwani's pressure, but Theranos had convinced her practice to accept in-office laboratory services from it to blunt her account of inaccurate test results.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="BSF事务所的迈克．布里耶寄了一封信给罗雪儿．吉本斯，扬言如果她不停止对Theranos和其高层「不实且有损名誉的指控」，就要对她提出告诉。在亚利桑那州凤凰城，有两个新病人到桑定医师的诊所无理取闹，他们还到Yelp网站留下对桑定医师的煽动性评论。桑定医师不得不聘请律师，才成功让Yelp撤下评论。另一头，我好不容易才让史都华医师不对包汪尼的施压低头，Theranos却又说服她执业诊所接受它的实验室服务，这等于直接打脸她所说Theranos检测不准确的说法。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In a last-ditch effort to prevent publication, Boies sent the Journal a third lengthy letter, reiterating his threat to sue the paper and dismissing my reporting as an elaborate fantasy concocted by a fertile mind:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="为了阻止刊登，波伊斯使出最后一招。他寄给《华尔街日报》第三封长信，再次威胁提告，并把我的报导斥为一个想像力丰富的脑袋精心编造的幻想故事：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The root of the problem may be the drama of the reporter's original thesis, which may fall into the category of "too good to check." That thesis, as Mr. Carreyrou explained in discussions with us, is that all of the recognition by the academic, scientific, and health-care communities of the breakthrough contributions of Theranos' achievements is wrong; that every previous published report about Theranos, including in The Journal itself, has been the result of misleading manipulation by the company; and that the company and its founder are essentially perpetrating a fraud by touting a technology that does not work and using existing commercial equipment to do tests that Theranos pretends are done with new technology. Certainly such an exposé, if true, would be a powerful piece of investigative journalism. The problem may be that even though that thesis is not true, it is just too dramatic to let go.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="问题的根源，可能就出在这位记者打从一开始的论点就充满戏剧性，是属于「好到舍不得去查证」（too good to check）那一类。如同凯瑞鲁（Carreyrou）先生（编按：本书作者）跟我们讨论时所解释的，他所持的论点是：Theranos的突破性贡献在学术界、科学界、医疗界所取得的一切认可，都是错误的；过去所有有关Theranos的媒体报导，包括《华尔街日报》本身的报导，都是Theranos一手操作误导的结果；Theranos和其创办人基本上是在犯一宗诈欺罪，吹捧一项根本不能用的技术、用现行商用仪器做检验却又假装是用Theranos新技术所做。当然，这种揭穿如果属实的话会是威力强大的调查报导，而实情很可能只是：这个论点虽不是真的，但实在太有戏剧效果，叫人割舍不了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I have tried to figure out how we could have arrived at a place where The Journal is considering publication of an article that we know to be false, misleading, and unfair, and that threatens to disclose information that Theranos rigorously protects as trade secrets.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我努力想搞清楚我们是怎么走到这个地步的——《华尔街日报》考虑刊出一篇文章，而我们知道那篇文章是不实的、误导的、不公的，甚至可能泄漏Theranos处心积虑要保护的商业机密。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At 4:00 p. m. on Thursday, October 8, we met with Boies again in a different conference room on the sixth floor of the Journal's newsroom. This time, he came with a smaller contingent made up of Heather King and Meredith Dearborn. As she had in June, King pulled out a little tape recorder and set it on the table between us.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="十月八日星期四下午四点，我们再次跟波伊斯碰面，地点在《华尔街日报》六楼新闻编辑部另一间会议室。这次他所率领的代表团比较小，有海瑟．金恩、梅瑞蒂丝．迪尔波恩。跟六月那次一样，金恩一开始就拿出一个小录音机，放在双方之间的桌上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The letter requested an audience with Gerry Baker, the Journal's editor in chief. For the sake of fairness, Baker granted him one but made sure to invite me and Mike to attend as well as Jay Conti and Neal Lipschutz, the paper's standards editor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这封信还请求拜会《华尔街日报》总编辑杰瑞．贝克（Gerry Baker）。为了公正起见，贝克同意，但也要求邀请我和麦可参加，还有杰．康提以及新闻规范编辑尼尔．立普修兹（Neal Lipschutz）。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Although they continued to argue strenuously that my reporting was flawed and inaccurate, Boies and King made two key admissions during this second meeting that strengthened our hand. Acknowledging for the first time that Theranos didn't run all of its blood tests on its proprietary devices, Boies described the transition to doing so as "a journey" that would take the company some time to complete. The second came after I brought up several recent wording changes I'd noticed on the Theranos website. One in particular seemed telling: the sentence "Many of our tests require only a few drops of blood" had been deleted. When I asked why, King inadvertently blurted out that she assumed it was for "marketing accuracy." (Later, she would insist she never pronounced those words.)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然他们仍然继续据理反对刊登报导，但这次波伊斯和金恩做了两大招认，强化了我方的立场。一是他们首度承认，Theranos并不是所有检验都用其独家设备，波伊斯形容要做到那个程度是「一段长途旅程」，需要花点时间才能达成。第二是我提到，我发现Theranos网站的措辞最近有些改变，其中特别明显的是，删掉了「我们很多检验只需要几滴血液即可进行」，我询问为什么，金恩不小心脱口说出她认为那是为了「行销精准度」（后来她坚持从未说这些话）。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mike and I asked how soon it could take place, which tests would be administered, and what assurance we would have that the results would come from the device and not involve some sleight of hand. When Boies replied that it would probably take several weeks to organize and was wishy-washy on the other points, Baker politely declined the offer. He shared our view that we had to publish before Holmes's appearance at the Journal's tech conference, which was less than two weeks away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我和麦可问，展示最快什么时候可以进行、会做哪些检验、如何保证检验结果真的是出自这台设备而没有耍花招，波伊斯回答大概需要好几个星期安排，至于另外几个问题则答得不确定、不清楚，于是贝克婉拒了他的提议。贝克的想法跟我们一样，必须在霍姆斯现身《华尔街日报》的科技年会之前刊出，而年会就在不到两个星期后。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Toward the end of the meeting, Boies tried one last tack: if we were willing to delay going to press a little longer, he would arrange a demonstration of the Theranos device. They had done one for Fortune magazine not long before, he said, so there was no reason they couldn't do one for us too. Such a demonstration would provide the incontrovertible proof that we were wrong about the machine not working, Boies contended.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="会议接近尾声时，波伊斯搬出最后一招：如果我们愿意多延一点时间再刊登，他会安排一场展示，示范Theranos的设备。他说，他们不久前才为《财星》杂志做过一次，没有理由不能为我们再做一次。波伊斯声称，这种展示是无可争辩的证据，可以证明我们所说「这台机器不能用」是错的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The story sparked a firestorm. NPR interviewed me on its Marketplace program first thing in the morning. The editor of Fortune, the publication that had done more than any other to elevate Holmes to stardom, made the story the focus of his daily email to readers. "A high-flying unicorn has been brought closer to earth this morning by a deeply reported story on the front page of the Wall Street Journal," he wrote. Forbes and The New Yorker, two other magazines that had played roles in Holmes's rise to fame, also picked up the story, as did many other news outlets.</div>

<div class="line_en">The story was published on the Journal's front page on Thursday, October 15, 2015. The headline, "A Prized Startup's Struggles," was understated but the article itself was devastating. In addition to revealing that Theranos ran all but a small fraction of its tests on conventional machines and laying bare its proficiency-testing shenanigans and its dilution of finger-stick samples, it raised serious questions about the accuracy of its own devices. It ended with a quote from Maureen Glunz saying that "trial and error on people" was "not OK," bringing home what I felt was the most important point: the medical danger to which the company had exposed patients.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="二〇一五年十月十五日星期四，这篇报导刊登于《华尔街日报》头版，标题是「最有价值新创公司的挣扎」（A Prized Startup's Struggle），很轻描淡写，不过内文杀伤力十足，不仅踢爆Theranos的血液检验几乎都是用传统仪器所做，还揭露Theranos在能力测试的欺骗行为，以及对手指样本进行稀释，文章还严重质疑Theranos自家设备的准确性。文章最后引述莫琳．葛朗兹的话：「把『试误法』（trial and error，编按：通过尝试与错误，直到找到正确方法为止）用在民众身上是不可以的。」这句话让我深刻体认到最重要的一点：这家公司让病患暴露于医疗危险中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In Silicon Valley, it became the talk of the town. Some venture capitalists reflexively jumped to Holmes's defense. One of them was former Netscape cofounder Marc Andreessen, whose wife had just profiled Holmes in a cover story for the New York Times's style magazine headlined "Five Visionary Tech Entrepreneurs Who Are Changing the World." But others were less charitable, having long harbored doubts of their own. Why had Holmes always been so secretive about her technology? Why had she never recruited a board member with even basic knowledge of blood science? And why hadn't a single venture capital firm with expertise in health care put money into the company? For these observers, the story confirmed what they'd quietly suspected.</div>

<div class="line_en">He explained that the FDA had targeted the little tube because, as a medical device, it clearly fell under its jurisdiction and gave it the most solid legal cover to take action against the company. But the underlying reason for the inspection had been the poor clinical data Theranos had submitted to the agency in an effort to get it to approve its tests. When the inspectors had failed to find any better data on-site, the decision had been made to shut down the company's finger-stick testing by taking away the nanotainer, he said. That wasn't all: he said the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services had also just launched its own inspection of Theranos. He didn't know whether it was still ongoing but was sure it spelled more trouble for the company. Mike and I discussed these revelations and quickly went to work on a follow-up story for the next day's paper.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他进一步解释，FDA之所以锁定这个小管子是有原因的，医疗设备是FDA的管辖范围，因此这个东西正好给FDA一个很正当的表面理由，来对Theranos采取行动，实际上这次稽查的真正理由是：Theranos送交FDA的临床数据实在太糟糕。稽查员到现场找不到任何更好的数据后，决定拿走纳米容器，用这个方法来关掉Theranos的手指检验。还不只如此，他说CMS（联邦医疗保险和医疗补助服务中心）也刚展开对Theranos的稽查，他不知道稽查行动是不是仍在进行，不过他很确定Theranos这下麻烦大了。我和麦可对这些爆料内容做了一番讨论，然后很快就着手明天要刊登的后续报导。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I decided to try him again that day before lunch. This time he picked up the phone. On deep background, he confirmed to me that the FDA had recently conducted a surprise inspection of Theranos's facilities in Newark and Palo Alto. Dealing a severe blow to the company, the agency had declared its nanotainer an uncleared medical device and forbidden it from continuing to use it, he said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我决定那天午餐前再试一次，这次他接电话了。在身分保密的前提下，他向我证实，FDA最近的确分头到Theranos的纽华克和帕罗奥图所在地，突击稽查。他说，结果FDA宣布Theranos的纳米容器是未经核准的医疗设备，禁止继续使用。这无疑是对Theranos的严重打击。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We knew that the battle was far from over and that Theranos and Boies would be coming at us hard in the following days and weeks. Whether my reporting stood up to their attacks would largely depend on what actions, if any, regulators took. Rumors had been circulating among former Theranos employees of an FDA inspection, but I hadn't been able to confirm it by the time we went to press. I had called my source at the agency several times but hadn't been able to reach him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们很清楚这场战役离结束还早得很，接下来几天、几周，Theranos和波伊斯势必会恶狠狠向我们扑来，我的报导是不是承受得住他们的攻击，主要将取决于监管机关采取的作为（如果有任何作为的话）。Theranos前员工一直传言说，FDA对Theranos进行稽查，但是到我们刊出报导前，我迟迟无法证实。我多次打电话给我在FDA的线人，但一直联系不上他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I had sent Heather King an email earlier in the day to let her know I was working on a second story and to request a Theranos comment about the things I was going to report. King hadn't replied. I now knew why: toward the end of her interview with Cramer, Holmes dropped mention of the nanotainer withdrawal and spun it as a voluntary decision. She was trying to get ahead of my scoop.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天稍早我寄了封电邮给海瑟．金恩，告诉她我正在进行第二篇报导，并且要求Theranos对我即将报导的内容做出回应，当时金恩没有回复，我现在知道为什么了：接受克瑞莫访问近尾声的时候，霍姆斯主动提到纳米容器撤除一事，谎称这是Theranos自己主动的决定。她试图抢先我的独家报导一步。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A few hours later, I was standing over the shoulder of the page-one editor who was handling my new story when Holmes's face appeared on a nearby TV tuned to CNBC. We took a break from the edit and turned up the volume. Dressed in her usual all-black attire and sporting a strained smile, she played the role of the visionary Silicon Valley innovator who was being smeared by entrenched interests trying to thwart progress. "This is what happens when you work to change things," she said. "First they think you're crazy, then they fight you, and then all of a sudden you change the world." But, when Jim Cramer asked her about specific elements of the article, such as the company's use of third-party analyzers for most of its tests, she turned defensive and gave evasive and misleading answers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几个小时后，我站在头版编辑身后，探头看他处理我新写好的文章。这时，霍姆斯的脸孔出现在旁边一台锁定CNBC的电视上，我们停下编辑工作，转大电视音量。她一如往常全身黑衣打扮，脸上勉强挤出一丝微笑，这次扮演的是遭到恶意中伤的硅谷前瞻创新者，抹黑她的是企图阻挠改革进步的盘根错节利益，她说：「当你努力想改变一些事情就会发生这种事，他们会先认为你疯了，然后打击你，接着你突然就改变了世界。」不过，主持人吉姆．克瑞莫问到文章的具体内容时，譬如Theranos大部分的检测是用他厂生产的分析仪所做，她就转趋防守，做出闪躲又误导的回答。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Theranos had issued a second press release that morning that amounted to what we in the news business call a "nondenial denial." "We are disappointed to see that The Wall Street Journal still can't get its facts straight," it began, before going on to admit that the company had "temporarily" withdrawn its little blood tubes in what it portrayed as a proactive move to seek FDA clearance for their use.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天早上Theranos发布第二则新闻稿，里面的内容正是我们新闻界所谓的「不直接否认的否认」（nondenial denial）。新闻稿开头就说：「我们很失望看到《华尔街日报》仍然未能了解事实真相」，接着承认Theranos「暂时」撤除其血液小管，根据新闻稿的说法，这是Theranos为了取得FDA核可，而主动采取的行动。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We quickly published my follow-up piece online. Setting the record straight, it revealed that the FDA had forced the company to stop testing blood drawn from patients' fingers and declared its nanotainer an "unapproved medical device."

Holmes wasn't her usual well-put-together self. Her hair was disheveled from her travels and she wore glasses instead of contact lenses. Standing next to her were Balwani and Heather King. Striking a defiant tone, she told the assembled staff that the two articles the Journal had published were filled with falsehoods seeded by disgruntled former employees and competitors. This sort of thing was bound to happen when you were working to disrupt a huge industry with powerful incumbents who wanted to see you fail, she said.

<div class="line_en">Mike Siconolfi had wanted me to handle the interview, but the paper didn't like the idea of making last-minute changes to an event that had taken months of planning.

<div class="line_en">Holmes came out swinging almost from the start. That was no surprise: we had expected her to be combative. What we hadn't fully anticipated was her willingness to tell bald-face lies in a public forum. Not just once, but again and again during the half-hour interview. In addition to continuing to insist that the nanotainer withdrawal had been voluntary, she said the Edison devices referred to in my stories were an old technology that Theranos hadn't used in years. She also denied that the company had ever used commercial lab equipment for finger-stick tests. And she claimed that the way Theranos conducted proficiency testing was not only perfectly legal, it had the express blessing of regulators.</div>

<div class="line_en">The biggest lie, to my mind, was her categorical denial that Theranos diluted finger-stick samples before running them on commercial machines. "What the Journal described -- that we take a sample, dilute it, and put it on a commercial analyzer -- is inaccurate, and that's not what we do," she told Krim. "In fact, I bet you if you tried that, it wouldn't work because it's just not possible to dilute a sample and put it onto a commercial analyzer. I mean, there are so many things that are wrong with that." As I shook my head in disgust, a text flashed on my phone screen. It was from Alan Beam: "I can't believe what she just said!" he wrote.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在我看来最大的谎言是，她斩钉截铁否认Theranos先稀释手指样本再放进商用仪器做检验。她告诉克林姆：「《华尔街日报》说我们先稀释样本再放进商用分析仪，那不是事实，我们不是那么做的。事实上，我敢跟你打赌，那么做绝对不可行，因为稀释样本再放进商用分析仪根本不可能。我的意思是，那篇报导有太多错误。」我摇摇头，觉得恶心，这时我的手机屏幕闪现一则短信，是艾伦．毕姆传来的，他写道：「我不敢相信她竟然这么说！」">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">From there, Holmes turned her sights on the former employees who had spoken to me, calling them "confused" and seizing on their anonymity to discredit them. She claimed that one of them had worked at Theranos for only two months back in 2005, which was a complete fabrication. All our confidential sources had worked at the company in recent times. In response to a question about Rochelle Gibbons, she reprised the line she'd used with her employees five days earlier, likening the Journal to "a tabloid magazine." And she referred to me as "some guy" who had reported "false stuff about us."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接下来，她把矛头转向跟我爆料的前员工，她说他们「搞不清楚」，并且紧抓着匿名这一点来削弱其可信度。她还宣称其中一位只在二〇〇五年到Theranos工作两个月。这种说法完全是凭空捏造，我们每个线人都是近期在那里工作。回答有关罗雪儿．吉本斯的问题时，她重复五天前跟员工说过的话，把《华尔街日报》比做「八卦杂志」，她还说我是「某个对我们做出不实报导的家伙」。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One problem she faced was that we were no longer the only ones raising questions about Theranos. Several prominent Silicon Valley figures had begun criticizing the company publicly. One of them was a well-known former Apple executive named Jean-Louis Gassée. A few days earlier, Gassée had published an item on his blog describing sharply discordant blood-test results he had received from Theranos and Stanford Hospital over the summer. Gassée had written Holmes to inquire about the discrepancies but had never received a response. When Krim raised Gassée's case, Holmes claimed to have never received his email. Now that it knew about his complaint, Theranos would reach out to him to try to understand what had happened, she said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她开始面临到一个问题，现在已经不只是我们对Theranos提出质疑，有几位硅谷名人也开始公开批评这家公司，其中一位是鼎鼎大名的苹果前高层尚–路易．盖西（Jean-Louis Gassée）。几天前，盖西在自己的博客贴文，描述他夏天分别在Theranos和斯坦福医院做的血液检验结果，落差很大。他曾去信询问霍姆斯，但从未收到回复。当克林姆问起盖西的事，霍姆斯的说法是：她没收到他的电邮，现在知道他的投诉了，Theranos会主动跟他联系了解事情始末。">查看中文翻译</div>
