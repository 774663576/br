<div class="line_en">Gingerly indeed… and these would be the ginger jars. Tyrion lifted one for inspection. It was round and ruddy, a fat clay grapefruit. A little big for his hand, but it would fit comfortably in the grip of a normal man, he knew. The pottery was thin, so fragile that even he had been warned not to squeeze too tightly, lest he crush it in his fist. The clay felt roughened, pebbled. Hallyne told him that was intentional. "A smooth pot is more apt to slip from a man's grasp." The wildfire oozed slowly toward the lip of the jar when Tyrion tilted it to peer inside. The color would be a murky green, he knew, but the poor light made that impossible to confirm. "Thick," he observed.</div>

<div class="line_en">Even so, he was glad he had listened. The chill in the long dank vault went bone deep. Timett had chosen to retreat back up to the cellar after a brief taste of the cold below. They were somewhere under the hill of Rhaenys, behind the Guildhall of the Alchemists. The damp stone walls were splotchy with nitre, and the only light came from the sealed iron-and-glass oil lamp that Hallyne the Pyromancer carried so gingerly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然如此，他还是很高兴自己接受了建议。漫长的地窖阴湿黑暗，寒气彻骨。提魅没走几步，稍稍感受寒意，便决定退回上层去。他们位于雷妮丝丘陵地底深处，就在练金术士的公会大厅下方。潮湿的石墙上遍布硝石，唯一的光源来自火术士哈林小心翼翼地提着的那盏密封的铁条玻璃油灯。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They had warned him to dress warmly. Tyrion Lannister took them at their word. He was garbed in heavy quilted breeches and a woolen doublet, and over it all he had thrown the shadowskin cloak he had acquired in the Mountains of the Moon. The cloak was absurdly long, made for a man twice his height. When he was not ahorse, the only way to wear the thing was to wrap it around him several times, which made him look like a ball of striped fur.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们告诫他要穿暖一点，于是提利昂·兰尼斯特地穿上厚重的软垫长裤、羊毛外衣，罩上从明月山脉得来的影子山猫皮披风。那件披风原本是为他两倍身高的人穿用的，所以他穿起来长得夸张。下马后，唯一的穿法便是把披风在身上缠个好几圈，他看起来活像个斑纹毛球。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The substance was the pyromancers' own term for wildfire. They called each other wisdom as well, which Tyrion found almost as annoying as their custom of hinting at the vast secret stores of knowledge that they wanted him to think they possessed. Once theirs had been a powerful guild, but in recent centuries the maesters of the Citadel had supplanted the alchemists almost everywhere. Now only a few of the older order remained, and they no longer even pretended to transmute metals…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这种物质”，是火术士对野火的称呼。他们彼此间以“智者”相称，他们也习惯不断暗示自己学识广博，希望别人认为他们是饱学之士，这令提利昂十分不耐。的确，他们的公会曾盛极一时，但在最近几个世纪，学城的学士已经渐渐取代了各地的练金术士。如今这个古老组织的成员寥寥无几，也不再伪称有方子炼化金属…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That is from the cold, my lord," said Hallyne, a pallid man with soft damp hands and an obsequious manner. He was dressed in striped black-and-scarlet robes trimmed with sable, but the fur looked more than a little patchy and moth-eaten. "As it warms, the substance will flow more easily, like lamp oil."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“大人，这是因为地底的冷气，”哈林说。他是个脸色苍白的人，一双手又软又湿，态度极为谄媚。他穿着镶貂皮边的黑红条纹长袍，可毛皮看来有点稀疏，似乎还被蛾啃过。“温度升高之后，这种物质便会顺畅流动，就像灯油。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh, but it does," said Hallyne. "There is a vault below this one where we store the older pots. Those from King Aerys's day. It was his fancy to have the jars made in the shapes of fruits. Very perilous fruits indeed, my lord Hand, and, hmmm, riper now than ever, if you take my meaning. We have sealed them with wax and pumped the lower vault full of water, but even so… by rights they ought to have been destroyed, but so many of our masters were murdered during the Sack of King's Landing, the few acolytes who remained were unequal to the task. And much of the stock we made for Aerys was lost. Only last year, two hundred jars were discovered in a storeroom beneath the Great Sept of Baelor. No one could recall how they came there, but I'm sure I do not need to tell you that the High Septon was beside himself with terror. I myself saw that they were safely moved. I had a cart filled with sand, and sent our most able acolytes. We worked only by night, we --"</div>

<div class="line_en">When at last they reached the top of the steps, Tyrion shrugged out of his shadowskin fur and folded it over his arm. The Guildhall of the Alchemists was an imposing warren of black stone, but Hallyne led him through the twists and turns until they reached the Gallery of the iron Torches, a long echoing chamber where columns of green fire danced around black metal columns twenty feet tall. Ghostly flames shimmered off the polished black marble of the walls and floor and bathed the hall in an emerald radiance. Tyrion would have been more impressed if he hadn't known that the great iron torches had only been lit this morning in honor of his visit, and would be extinguished the instant the doors closed behind him. Wildfire was too costly to squander.</div>

He bid Hallyne farewell and waddled down to where Timett son of Timett waited with an escort of Burned Men. Given his purpose today, it had seemed a singularly appropriate choice for his guard. Besides, their scars struck terror in the hearts of the city rabble. That was all to the good these days. Only three nights past, another mob had gathered at the gates of the Red Keep, chanting for food. Joff had unleashed a storm of arrows against them, slaying four, and then shouted down that they had his leave to eat their dead. Winning us still more friends.</div>

"We have become swollen, bloated, foul. Brother couples with sister in the bed of kings, and the fruit of their incest capers in his palace to the piping of a twisted little monkey demon. Highborn ladies fornicate with fools and give birth to monsters! Even the High Septon has forgotten the gods! He bathes in scented waters and grows fat on lark and lamprey while his people starve!

When the boar did open him, a great stench rose to heaven and a thousand snakes slid forth from his belly, hissing and biting!" He jabbed his bony finger back at comet and castle.
