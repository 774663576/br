<div class="line_en">Among other public buildings in a certain town, which for many reasons it will be prudent to refrain from mentioning, and to which I will assign no fictitious name, there is one anciently common to most towns, great or small: to wit, a workhouse; and in this workhouse was born; on a day and date which I need not trouble myself to repeat, inasmuch as it can be of no possible consequence to the reader, in this stage of the business at all events; the item of mortality whose name is prefixed to the head of this chapter.</div>

<div class="line_en">For a long time after it was ushered into this world of sorrow and trouble, by the parish surgeon, it remained a matter of considerable doubt whether the child would survive to bear any name at all; in which case it is somewhat more than probable that these memoirs would never have appeared; or, if they had, that being comprised within a couple of pages, they would have possessed the inestimable merit of being the most concise and faithful specimen of biography, extant in the literature of any age or country.</div>

<div class="line_en">Although I am not disposed to maintain that the being born in a workhouse, is in itself the most fortunate and enviable circumstance that can possibly befall a human being, I do mean to say that in this particular instance, it was the best thing for Oliver Twist that could by possibility have occurred. The fact is, that there was considerable difficulty in inducing Oliver to take upon himself the office of respiration,-- a troublesome practice, but one which custom has rendered necessary to our easy existence; and for some time he lay gasping on a little flock mattress, rather unequally poised between this world and the next: the balance being decidedly in favour of the latter. Now, if, during this brief period, Oliver had been surrounded by careful grandmothers, anxious aunts, experienced nurses, and doctors of profound wisdom, he would most inevitably and indubitably have been killed in no time. There being nobody by, however, but a pauper old woman, who was rendered rather misty by an unwonted allowance of beer; and a parish surgeon who did such matters by contract; Oliver and Nature fought out the point between them. The result was, that, after a few struggles, Oliver breathed, sneezed, and proceeded to advertise to the inmates of the workhouse the fact of a new burden having been imposed upon the parish, by setting up as loud a cry as could reasonably have been expected from a male infant who had not been possessed of that very useful appendage, a voice, for a much longer space of time than three minutes and a quarter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我倒也无意坚持说，出生在贫民收容院这件事本身乃是一个人所能指望得到的最美妙、最惹人羡慕的运气，但我的确想指出，此时此刻，对奥立弗退斯特说来，这也许是最幸运的一件事了。不瞒你说，当时要奥立弗自个儿承担呼吸空气的职能都相当困难――呼吸本来就是一件麻烦事，偏偏习惯又使这项职能成了我们维持生存必不可少的事情。好一阵子，他躺在一张小小的毛毯上直喘气，在今生与来世之间摇摆不定，天平决定性地倾向于后者。别的且不说，在这个短暂的时光里，倘若奥立弗的周围是一班细致周到的老奶奶、热心热肠的大娘大婶、经验丰富的护土以及学识渊博的大夫，毫无疑义，他必定一下子就被结果了。幸好在场的只有一个济贫院的老太婆，她已经叫不大容易到手的一点啤酒弄得有些晕乎乎的了，外加一位按合同办理这类事情的教区外科医生。除此之外，没有旁人。奥立弗与造化之间的较量见了分晓了。结果是，几个回合下来，奥立弗呼吸平稳了，打了一个喷嚏，发出一阵高声啼哭，作为一名男婴，哭声之响是可以想见的，要知道他在远远超过三分十五秒的时间里还始终不曾具有嗓门这样一种很有用处的附件。他开始向全院上下公布一个事实：本教区又背上了一个新的包袱。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As Oliver gave this first proof of the free and proper action of his lungs, the patchwork coverlet which was carelessly flung over the iron bedstead, rustled; the pale face of a young woman was raised feebly from the pillow; and a faint voice imperfectly articulated the words, "Let me see the child, and die."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="奥立弗刚以这一番活动证明自己的肺部功能正常，运转自如，这时，胡乱搭在铁床架上的那张补钉摞补钉的床单飒飒地响了起来，一个年轻女子有气无力地从枕头上抬起苍白的面孔，用微弱的声音不十分清晰地吐出了几个字：“让我看一看孩子再死吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The surgeon had been sitting with his face turned towards the fire: giving the palms of his hands a warm and a rub alternately. As the young woman spoke, he rose, and advancing to the bed's head, said, with more kindness than might have been expected of him:</div>

<div class="line_en">Apparently this consolatory perspective of a mother's prospects failed in producing its due effect. The patient shook her head, and stretched out her hand towards the child.</div>

<div class="line_en">The surgeon deposited it in her arms. She imprinted her cold white lips passionately on its forehead; passed her hands over her face; gazed wildly round; shuddered; fell back -- and died. They chafed her breast, hands, and temples; but the blood had stopped forever. They talked of hope and comfort. They had been strangers too long.</div>

<div class="line_en">What an excellent example of the power of dress, young Oliver Twist was! Wrapped in the blanket which had hitherto formed his only covering, he might have been the child of a nobleman or a beggar; it would have been hard for the haughtiest stranger to have assigned him his proper station in society. But now that he was enveloped in the old calico robes which had grown yellow in the same service, he was badged and ticketed, and fell into his place at once -- a parish child -- the orphan of a workhouse -- the humble, half-starved drudge -- to be cuffed and buffeted through the world -- despised by all, and pitied by none.</div>
