<div class="line_en">Hedwig was still angry with Harry about the disasterous car journey and Ron's wand was still malfunctioning, surpassing itself on Friday morning by shooting out of Ron's hand in Charms and hitting tiny old Professor Flitwick squarely between the eyes, creating a large, throbbing green boil where it had struck. So with one thing and another, Harry was quite glad to reach the weekend. He, Ron, and Hermione were planning to visit Hagrid on Saturday morning. Harry, however, was shaken awake several hours earlier than he would have liked by Oliver Wood, Captain of the Gryffindor Quidditch team.</div>

Harder to avoid was Colin Creevey, who seemed to have memorized Harry's schedule.

<div class="line_en">"Yes," said Harry heavily, resigned to explaining the complicated rules of Quidditch. "They're called Bludgers. There are two Beaters on each team who carry clubs to beat the Bludgers away from their side. Fred and George Weasley are the Gryffindor Beaters."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对，”哈利吐了口粗气，无可奈何地开始解释魁地奇的复杂规则，“它们叫游走球。每个队有两名队员用棍子把游走球赶开。弗雷德和乔治韦斯莱是格兰芬多的击球手。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，鬼飞球，就是那个红色的大球，是进球得分用的。每个队有三名追球手把鬼飞球传来传去，设法使它穿过球场顶头的球门，就是三根顶上有圆环的长柱子。”">查看中文翻译</div>

And whichever team's Seeker gets the Snitch earns his team an extra hundred and fifty points."</div>

<div class="line_en">The rest of the Gryffindor team were already in the changing room. Wood was the only person who looked truly awake. Fred and George Weasley were sitting, puffy-eyed and touslehaired, next to fourth year Alicia Spinnet, who seemed to be nodding off against the wall behind her. Her fellow Chasers, Katie Bell and Angelina Johnson, were yawning side by side opposite them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="格兰芬多队的其他球员已经在更衣室了。看上去只有伍德是完全醒了。弗雷德和乔治韦斯莱坐在那里，眼圈浮肿，头发乱蓬蓬的。旁边的四年级女生艾丽娅斯平内特好像靠在墙上打起了瞌睡。另两名追球手，凯蒂贝尔和安吉利娜约翰逊坐在对面，连连打着哈欠。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But Colin didn't stop questioning Harry all the way down the sloping lawns to the Quidditch field, and Harry only shook him off when he reached the changing rooms; Colin called after him in a piping voice, "I'll go and get a good seat, Harry!" and hurried off to the stands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是在沿草坡走向球场的一路上，科林仍然不停地问这问那，一直到更衣室门口，哈利才把他甩掉。科林在他身后尖声叫道：“我去找个好座位，哈利！”然后匆匆向看台跑去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There you are, Harry, what kept you?" said Wood briskly. "Now, I wanted a quick talk with you all before we actually get onto the field, because I spent the summer devising a whole new training program, which I really think will make all the difference…</div>

<div class="line_en">Wood was holding up a large diagram of a Quidditch field, on which were drawn many lines, arrows, and crosses in differentcolored inks. He took out his wand, tapped the board, and the arrows began to wiggle over the diagram like caterpillars. As Wood launched into a speech about his new tactics, Fred Weasley's head drooped right onto Alicia Spinnet's shoulder and he began to snore.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伍德举起一块魁地奇球场的大型示意图，上面绘有各种颜色的线条、箭头和叉叉。他取出魔杖，朝着图板上一点，那些箭头就像毛毛虫一样在图板上蠕动起来。五德开始讲解他的新战术，弗雷德韦斯莱的头垂到了艾丽娅的肩上，打起了呼噜。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They had been in the locker room so long that the sun was up completely now, although remnants of mist hung over the grass in the stadium. As Harry walked onto the field, he saw Ron and Hermione sitting in the stands.</div>
