<div class="line_en">AT Paris, just after dark one gusty evening in the autumn of 18—, I was enjoying the twofold luxury of meditation and a meerschaum, in company with my friend C. Auguste Dupin, in his little back library, or book-closet, au troisiême, No. 33, Rue Dunôt, Faubourg St. Germain. For one hour at least we had maintained a profound silence; while each, to any casual observer, might have seemed intently and exclusively occupied with the curling eddies of smoke that oppressed the atmosphere of the chamber. For myself, however, I was mentally discussing certain topics which had formed matter for conversation between us at an earlier period of the evening; I mean the affair of the Rue Morgue, and the mystery attending the murder of Marie Roget. I looked upon it, therefore, as something of a coincidence, when the door of our apartment was thrown open and admitted our old acquaintance, Monsieur G --, the Prefect of the Parisian police.</div>

<div class="line_en">We gave him a hearty welcome; for there was nearly half as much of the entertaining as of the contemptible about the man, and we had not seen him for several years. We had been sitting in the dark, and Dupin now arose for the purpose of lighting a lamp, but sat down again, without doing so, upon G.'s saying that he had called to consult us, or rather to ask the opinion of my friend, about some official business which had occasioned a great deal of trouble.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们向他表示热烈欢迎，因为这个人谈吐有趣，差不多有一半抵过了他为人的可鄙，而且我们已经有几年没看见他了。我们一直坐在黑暗的房间里，这时，迪潘站起来打算点灯，可是他又坐下了，没去点灯，因为G一说，他来拜访是为了一些已经引起很多麻烦的公事要向我们请教，或者更确切地说，为了要征求我的朋友的意见。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Why, I will tell you," replied the Prefect, as he gave a long, steady, and contemplative puff, and settled himself in his chair. "I will tell you in a few words; but, before I begin, let me caution you that this is an affair demanding the greatest secrecy, and that I should most probably lose the position I now hold, were it known that I confided it to any one."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嘿，我这就要告诉你，”警察局长回答道，他于是深思再三地慢慢喷出一长缕烟云，在他那张椅子上坐下来。“我可以用几句话告诉你，不过，在我未讲之前，让我先提醒你们，这是一桩要求绝对严守机密的案子，万一让人知道我向谁透露了消息，我大概十之八九会丢掉我现在担任的职位的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“请你说得再清楚一点。”我说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It is clearly inferred," replied the Prefect, "from the nature of the document, and from the non-appearance of certain results which would at once arise from its passing out of the robber's possession; -- that is to say, from his employing it as he must design in the end to employ it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这是明摆着的，”警察局长回答道，“从文件的性质可以推断出来，还有，文件从抢走的人手里一传出去，立即会引起某种后果，这就是说，他要利用这个文件，而且他一定会计划在最后利用这个文件，但是，并没有出现这种情况。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“不明白吗？好吧；如果把文件透露给第三个人，现在且不说他的姓名，那可要使人们对一个地位极高的人的名誉产生怀疑；这样就使持有文件的人占了优势，弄得那位辉煌人物的名誉和安静生活都要因此受到危险。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The thief," said G., "is the Minister D --, who dares all things, those unbecoming as well as those becoming a man. The method of the theft was not less ingenious than bold. The document in question -- a letter, to be frank -- had been received by the personage robbed while alone in the royal boudoir. During its perusal she was suddenly interrupted by the entrance of the other exalted personage from whom especially it was her wish to conceal it. After a hurried and vain endeavor to thrust it in a drawer, she was forced to place it, open as it was, upon a table. The address, however, was uppermost, and, the contents thus unexposed, the letter escaped notice. At this juncture enters the Minister D --. His lynx eye immediately perceives the paper, recognises the handwriting of the address, observes the confusion of the personage addressed, and fathoms her secret. After some business transactions, hurried through in his ordinary manner, he produces a letter somewhat similar to the one in question, opens it, pretends to read it, and then places it in close juxtaposition to the other. Again he converses, for some fifteen minutes, upon the public affairs. At length, in taking leave, he takes also from the table the letter to which he had no claim. Its rightful owner saw, but, of course, dared not call attention to the act, in the presence of the third personage who stood at her elbow. The minister decamped; leaving his own letter -- one of no importance -- upon the table."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这个贼，”G一说，“正是D一部长，他什么都敢，不论是象男人做的，还是不象男人做的事。偷盗的方法之巧妙也不亚于他的胆大妄为。所说的这个文件，坦率地讲，就是一封信，它是失去信件的人单独待在皇宫内院里的时候收到的。她正在仔细地看信，可是突然被人打断了，另外有一位高贵人物进来了，而且她正好特别不愿意让他看见这封信。她打算把信塞到抽屉里，可是匆匆忙忙，白费力气，她只好把那封信，照原样敞开着放在桌子上。尽管这样，最上面的是地址，内容并没有暴露，这封信也没有引起注意，正在这个关节上，D一部长进来了，他那双狸猫眼立刻看见了信纸认出了地址的笔迹，看出了收信人不知所措，并且揣测到她的秘密。他办了几件公事，像他平常那样匆匆处理完毕，然后，他拿出一封信，跟所说的那封信仿佛差不多，拆开来，假装在看信，接着又把这封信放在靠近另外那封信的位置。他又谈起了公事，大约谈了15分钟。最后，他告辞了，可是他把桌子上那封他无权占有的信也带走了。这封信的合法的主人看见了，可是，当着那第三者的面，他正站在她旁边，当然，她不敢要人注意这样的行为。这位部长转移阵地了，他把他自己的信，一封不要紧的信．留在桌子上了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes," replied the Prefect; "and the power thus attained has, for some months past, been wielded, for political purposes, to a very dangerous extent. The personage robbed is more thoroughly convinced, every day, of the necessity of reclaiming her letter. But this, of course, cannot be done openly. In fine, driven to despair, she has committed the matter to me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，”警察局长回答道，“而且把这样弄到手的权柄，为了政治上的目的，在前几个月运用到了十分危险的程度。这位失盗的人一天比一天更透彻地认识到有必要把她的信收回来。可是，当然，这也不是可以公开地做得到的。最后，她被逼得走投无路，把这件事委托我了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"True," said G.; "and upon this conviction I proceeded. My first care was to make thorough search of the minister's hotel; and here my chief embarrassment lay in the necessity of searching without his knowledge.

<div class="line_cn" title="“的确，”G一说，“我也是抱着这样的信心开始做起来的。我首先考虑的是要彻底搜查这位部长的旅馆。在这一点上，使我为难的主要问题在于有必要不让他知道在搜查。其他的一切都不必谈，我已经得到警告，要是让他感到有理由怀疑我们的企图，那就会产生危险的后果。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It is clear," said I, "as you observe, that the letter is still in possession of the minister; since it is this possession, and not any employment of the letter, which bestows the power. With the employment the power departs."</div>

<div class="line_en">"O yes; and for this reason I did not despair. The habits of the minister gave me, too, a great advantage. He is frequently absent from home all night. His servants are by no means numerous. They sleep at a distance from their master's apartments, and, being chiefly Neapolitans, are readily made drunk. I have keys, as you know, with which I can open any chamber or cabinet in Paris. For three months a night has not passed, during the greater part of which I have not been engaged, personally, in ransacking the D -- Hotel. My honor is interested, and, to mention a great secret, the reward is enormous. So I did not abandon the search until I had become fully satisfied that the thief is a more astute man than myself. I fancy that I have investigated every nook and corner of the premises in which it is possible that the paper can be concealed."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，是的；正因为有这一层，我并没有感到失望。这位部长的习惯也对我十分有利。他常常整夜不在家。他的仆人也绝不是十分多的。他们睡的地方离他们主人的那套房间有一段距离，还有，他们大半是那不勒斯人，所以很容易弄得喝醉酒。我有钥匙，你也知道，巴黎的任何一间房，任何一个柜子，我都能打开。一连三个月，为了搜查这家D一旅馆，一夜都没有错过，我每一夜都亲自参加一大部分的工作。我的名誉要紧，再告诉你一件十分机密的事，酬金的数目极大。所以我没有放弃搜查，直到后来我才完全佩服这个贼比我更加精明。我以为凡是可能隐藏这份文件的每一个角落我都检查过了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

I took the entire building, room by room; devoting the nights of a whole week to each. We examined, first, the furniture of each apartment. We opened every possible drawer; and I presume you know that, to a properly trained police agent, such a thing as a secret drawer is impossible. Any man is a dolt who permits a 'secret' drawer to escape him in a search of this kind. The thing is so plain. There is a certain amount of bulk -- of space -- to be accounted for in every cabinet. Then we have accurate rules. The fiftieth part of a line could not escape us. After the cabinets we took the chairs. The cushions we probed with the fine long needles you have seen me employ. From the tables we removed the tops."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“从他所费的气力来看吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The measures, then," he continued, " were good in their kind, and well executed; their defect lay in their being inapplicable to the case, and to the man. A certain set of highly ingenious resources are, with the Prefect, a sort of Procrustean bed, to which he forcibly adapts his designs. But he perpetually errs by being too deep or too shallow, for the matter in hand; and many a schoolboy is a better reasoner than he. I knew one about eight years of age, whose success at guessing in the game of 'even and odd' attracted universal admiration. This game is simple, and is played with marbles. One player holds in his hand a number of these toys, and demands of another whether that number is even or odd. If the guess is right, the guesser wins one; if wrong, he loses one. The boy to whom I allude won all the marbles of the school. Of course he had some principle of guessing; and this lay in mere observation and admeasurement of the astuteness of his opponents. For example, an arrant simpleton is his opponent, and, holding up his closed hand, asks, 'are they even or odd?' Our schoolboy replies, 'odd,' and loses; but upon the second trial he wins, for he then says to himself, 'the simpleton had them even upon the first trial, and his amount of cunning is just sufficient to make him have them odd upon the second; I will therefore guess odd;' -- he guesses odd, and wins. Now, with a simpleton a degree above the first, he would have reasoned thus: 'This fellow finds that in the first instance I guessed odd, and, in the second, he will propose to himself, upon the first impulse, a simple variation from even to odd, as did the first simpleton; but then a second thought will suggest that this is too simple a variation, and finally he will decide upon putting it even as before. I will therefore guess even;' -- he guesses even, and wins. Now this mode of reasoning in the schoolboy, whom his fellows termed 'lucky,' -- what, in its last analysis, is it?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那么，这些措施，”他接下去说，“本身都是好的，而且执行得很好。它们的缺点在于对这个案子和这个人不能适用。对于这位警察局长，一套十分别出心裁的计策，可说是一张普罗克拉斯提斯的床①他硬要使他的计划适合这套计策。他处理他手上的案件，总是要犯钻得太深或者看得太浅的错误，许多小学生都比他头脑清楚。我认识一个八岁的小学生，在玩‘单双’游戏的时候，他猜得很难，引得人人钦佩。这个游戏很简单，要用石弹子来玩。一个人手里握着一定数目的弹子，要求另一个人来猜这个数是单是双。如果猜中了，猜的人赢一粒弹子，如果猜错了，他就输一个弹子。我说的这个男孩子把学校里所有的石弹子都赢过来了。当然，他猜起来是有点道理的，那不过是要观察和衡量他的对手的精明程度。例如，对方是个大笨蛋，举着握紧了的手来问，‘是单是双？’我们的小学生回答，‘单，”他输了，可是第二次再试，他赢了，因为他自己寻思，‘这个笨蛋第一次用的是双，他那一点狡猾本事只够让他在第二次用单数，所以我要猜单，”他于是猜单，赢了。那么，对于比起先的这个笨得好一点的，他会这样来分析：‘这个家伙看到我第一次猜单，他首先想到的第一个念头，大概是要采取由双到单的简单变化，像第一个笨蛋一样，可是他再想一下就觉得这种变化太简单了，最后他决定还是像先前那样用双数，所以我要猜双；’他猜双，赢了，这是小学生推理的方式，小伙伴都说他‘侥幸’……那么，归根到底，这是怎么回事呢？”【注：①①普罗克拉斯提斯是希腊传说中的一个强盗，他把落到他手里的人放生到一张铁床上，砍掉比床长的部分，比床短就硬把这个人拉长。后人遂以此比喻生搬硬套，强求一致的措施。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“那不过是，”我说，“推理的人有设身处地体察他对手的智力罢了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"For its practical value it depends upon this," replied Dupin; "and the Prefect and his cohort fail so frequently, first, by default of this identification, and, secondly, by ill-admeasurement, or rather through non-admeasurement, of the intellect with which they are engaged. They consider only their own ideas of ingenuity; and, in searching for anything hidden, advert only to the modes in which they would have hidden it. They are right in this much -- that their own ingenuity is a faithful representative of that of the mass; but when the cunning of the individual felon is diverse in character from their own, the felon foils them, of course. This always happens when it is above their own, and very usually when it is below. They have no variation of principle in their investigations; at best, when urged by some unusual emergency -- by some extraordinary reward -- they extend or exaggerate their old modes of practice, without touching their principles. What, for example, in this case of D --, has been done to vary the principle of action? What is all this boring, and probing, and sounding, and scrutinizing with the microscope, and dividing the surface of the building into registered square inches -- what is it all but an exaggeration of the application of the one principle or set of principles of search, which are based upon the one set of notions regarding human ingenuity, to which the Prefect, in the long routine of his duty, has been accustomed? Do you not see he has taken it for granted that all men proceed to conceal a letter, -- not exactly in a gimlet-hole bored in a chair-leg -- but, at least, in some out-of-the-way hole or corner suggested by the same tenor of thought which would urge a man to secrete a letter in a gimlet-hole bored in a chair-leg? And do you not see also, that such recherches nooks for concealment are adapted only for ordinary occasions, and would be adopted only by ordinary intellects; for, in all cases of concealment, a disposal of the article concealed -- a disposal of it in this recherché manner, -- is, in the very first instance, presumed and presumable; and thus its discovery depends, not at all upon the acumen, but altogether upon the mere care, patience, and determination of the seekers; and where the case is of importance -- or, what amounts to the same thing in the policial eyes, when the reward is of magnitude, -- the qualities in question have never been known to fail. You will now understand what I meant in suggesting that, had the purloined letter been hidden any where within the limits of the Prefect's examination -- in other words, had the principle of its concealment been comprehended within the principles of the Prefect -- its discovery would have been a matter altogether beyond question. This functionary, however, has been thoroughly mystified; and the remote source of his defeat lies in the supposition that the Minister is a fool, because he has acquired renown as a poet. All fools are poets; this the Prefect feels; and he is merely guilty of a non distributio medii in thence inferring that all poets are fools."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“从实用价值来看，这是关键，”迪潘回答道；“警察局长和他那一帮人这么经常地失策，首先是因为没有这样设身处地想一想，其次是估计不当，或者更确切地说，根本没有估计他们所对付的人的智力。他们只考虑他们自己的巧妙主意，在搜查任何藏起来的东西的时候，只想到他们自己会以什么方式来隐藏东西。他们只有这一点对——他们自己的智谋忠实地体现了大众的智谋，可是如果那个罪犯的鬼主意在性质上跟他们自己的不一样，他会使他们枉费心机的。当然罗，如果比他们自己的高明，那就老是会发生这种情况，如果不如他们，那也时常会这样。他们进行调查的原则一成不变；至多，由于情况非常紧急，或者在重赏的促使之下，他们会把老一套的办法扩充或者变本加厉地运用一番，可也不会去碰一碰他们的原则。例如，在D一这桩案子里，有没有做过什么事去改变行动的原则呢？钻孔，用探针刺探，测量，用显微镜观察，还有把房子的表面分成多少编了号的平方英寸，这一大套是干什么呢？这不过是根据那一套对人类的心机的见解，把警察局长在长期例行公事里习以为常的那种或者那一套搜查的原则，变本加厉地运用起来，还能是别的吗？难道你没有看出，他认为理所当然，凡是人要想藏信，虽然不一定去把椅子腿钻个洞，至少也总要放在什么偏僻的小洞或者角落里，这岂不是跟劝人把椅子腿钻个洞来藏信的主意一脉相承吗？难道你也没有看出，这样考究的藏东西的角落只适合于寻常的情况，大概只有智力寻常的人才会采用；可以说，在凡是要隐藏东西的案子里，对所隐藏的东西的处理，以这种考究的方式来处理，这首先就是可以想见的，而且本来料得到的；因而，要查出赃物，完全不必依靠才智，而全然是依靠追查的人细心、耐心和决心；遇到案情重大，或者从政治眼光看也同样关系重大，而且赏格非同小可，那倒从来没听见有在所说的这些条件上失策的。现在你可以明白我的意思了，譬如说，假定失窃的信确实是藏在警察局长搜查范围之内的什么地方，换句话说，假定藏信的原则包括在警察局长的那些原则之内，那么，查出信来大概也原本不在话下。可是，这位长官却完全受了蒙骗。他失败的原因在于他推测这位部长是个笨蛋，因为D一已经有了诗人的名气。凡是笨蛋都是诗人；这位警察局长觉得就是这样，他不过是犯了使用不周的命题的错误，而因此推断出，凡是诗人都是笨蛋。”">查看中文翻译</div>

With an art worthy a better cause, for example, they have insinuated the term 'analysis' into application to algebra. The French are the originators of this particular deception; but if a term is of any importance -- if words derive any value from applicability -- then 'analysis' conveys 'algebra' about as much as, in Latin, 'ambitus' implies 'ambition,' 'religio' 'religion,' or 'homines honesti,' a set of honorable men."</div>

<div class="line_en">"I dispute the availability, and thus the value, of that reason which is cultivated in any especial form other than the abstractly logical. I dispute, in particular, the reason educed by mathematical study. The mathematics are the science of form and quantity; mathematical reasoning is merely logic applied to observation upon form and quantity. The great error lies in supposing that even the truths of what is called pure algebra, are abstract or general truths. And this error is so egregious that I am confounded at the universality with which it has been received. Mathematical axioms are not axioms of general truth. What is true of relation -- of form and quantity -- is often grossly false in regard to morals, for example. In this latter science it is very usually untrue that the aggregated parts are equal to the whole. In chemistry also the axiom fails. In the consideration of motive it fails; for two motives, each of a given value, have not, necessarily, a value when united, equal to the sum of their values apart. There are numerous other mathematical truths which are only truths within the limits of relation. But the mathematician argues, from his finite truths, through habit, as if they were of an absolutely general applicability -- as the world indeed imagines them to be. Bryant, in his very learned 'Mythology,' mentions an analogous source of error, when he says that 'although the Pagan fables are not believed, yet we forget ourselves continually, and make inferences from them as existing realities.' With the algebraist, however, who are Pagans themselves, the 'Pagan fables' are believed, and the inferences are made, not so much through lapse of memory, as through an unaccountable addling of the brains. In short, I never yet encountered the mere mathematician who could be trusted out of equal roots, or one who did not clandestinely hold it as a point of his faith that x 2 +px was absolutely and unconditionally equal to q. Say to one of these gentlemen, by way of experiment, if you please, that you believe occasions may occur where x 2 +px is not altogether equal to q, and, having made him understand what you mean, get out of his reach as speedily as convenient, for, beyond doubt, he will endeavor to knock you down.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“关于用抽象逻辑以外的其他任何特殊形式培植起来的理智，我对它的效用，也就是它的价值，表示怀疑。我尤其怀疑的是，由研究数学而引导出的理智。数学是形式和数量的科学；数学的推理仅仅是在考查形状和数量时的所用的逻辑。所以会铸成大错，在于设想连所谓纯代数的真理也都是抽象真理或普遍真理。而且这种错误又错得这么异乎寻常，从它一向为人们接受的普通程度来看，我觉得十分令人厌恶。数学的公理并不是普遍真实的公理。譬如，适用于表示关系，表示形状和数量的正确道理，用在伦理学方面却往往大错特错。在伦理学上，要说各部分累积之和等于整体，那常常是完全不能成立的。在化学方面，这个公理也不能成立。在考察动机的时候，它不能成立，因为两种动机，各有既定的价值，把二者结合起来得出的价值不一定等于它们各自的价值之和。还有其他的许多数学真理，仅仅在表示关系的限度之内才是真理。然而数学家却出于习惯，根据他的有限真理来论证，仿佛它们具有绝对的普遍适用的性质、也正象全世界的确以为它们都能普遍适用似的。布莱恩特①在他的十分渊博的《神话》中提到一种类似的错误根源，他说，‘虽然异教的传说是不可信的，我们却不断地忘记我们自己的身份，把它们当作既存在的现实，根据它们来进行论证。’对于代数学家，既然他们本身是不相信基督的异教徒，‘异教的传说’就是可信的，他们根据这些来论证，与其说是出于记性不好，倒不如说是出于不可理解的一种糊涂头脑。总之，我还没有遇到一个在求等根以外能靠得住的数学家，也没有哪个不是私下里坚信X*X＋PX是绝对无条件地等于q的。如果你愿意，你不妨试一试，对这些先生之中的某一位说，你相信可能出现X*X＋PX完全不等于q的情况，在你使他明白了你的意思之后，你赶紧溜走，让他抓不住你，因为没有疑问，他是一定要把你打翻在地的。”【注：①①布莱恩特（JacobBryant1715－1804），英国语言学家表兼文物工作者，《神话》是他的重要著作。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I mean to say," continued Dupin, while I merely laughed at his last observations, "that if the Minister had been no more than a mathematician, the Prefect would have been under no necessity of giving me this check. Had he no more than a poet, I think it probable that he would have foiled us all. I knew him, however, as both mathematician and poet, and my measures were adapted to his capacity, with reference to the circumstances by which he was surrounded. I knew him as a courtier, too, and as a bold intriguant. Such a man, I considered, could not fail to be aware of the ordinary policial modes of action. He could not have failed to anticipate -- and events have proved that he did not fail to anticipate -- the waylayings to which he was subjected. He must have foreseen, I reflected, the secret investigations of his premises. His frequent absences from home at night, which were hailed by the Prefect as certain aids to his success, I regarded only as ruses, to afford opportunity for thorough search to the police, and thus the sooner to impress them with the conviction to which G --, in fact, did finally arrive -- the conviction that the letter was not upon the premises. I felt, also, that the whole train of thought, which I was at some pains in detailing to you just now, concerning the invariable principle of policial action in searches for articles concealed -- I felt that this whole train of thought would necessarily pass through the mind of the Minister. It would imperatively lead him to despise all the ordinary nooks of concealment. He could not, I reflected, be so weak as not to see that the most intricate and remote recess of his hotel would be as open as his commonest closets to the eyes, to the probes, to the gimlets, and to the microscopes of the Prefect. I saw, in fine, that he would be driven, as a matter of course, to simplicity, if not deliberately induced to it as a matter of choice. You will remember, perhaps, how desperately the Prefect laughed when I suggested, upon our first interview, that it was just possible this mystery troubled him so much on account of its being so very self-evident."</div>

The principle of the vis inertiæ, for example, with the amount of momentum proporionate with it and consequent upon it, seems to be identical in physics and metaphysics. It is not more true in the former, that a large body is with more difficulty set in motion than a smaller one, and that its subsequent impetus is commensurate with this difficulty, than it is, in the latter, that intellects of the vaster capacity, while more forcible, more constant, and more eventful in their movements than those of inferior grade, are yet the less readily moved, and more embarrassed and full of hesitation in the first few steps of their progress.

One party playing requires another to find a given word -- the name of town, river, state or empire -- any word, in short, upon the motley and perplexed surface of the chart. A novice in the game generally seeks to embarrass his opponents by giving them the most minutely lettered names; but the adept selects such words as stretch, in large characters, from one end of the chart to the other. These, like the over-largely lettered signs and placards of the street, escape observation by dint of being excessively obvious; and here the physical oversight is precisely analogous with the moral inapprehension by which the intellect suffers to pass unnoticed those considerations which are too obtrusively and too palpably self-evident. But this is a point, it appears, somewhat above or beneath the understanding of the Prefect. He never once thought it probable, or possible, that the Minister had deposited the letter immediately beneath the nose of the whole world, by way of best preventing any portion of that world from perceiving it.</div>

But, then, the radicalness of these differences, which was excessive; the dirt; the soiled and torn condition of the paper, so inconsistent with the true methodical habits of D --, and so suggestive of a design to delude the beholder into an idea of the worthlessness of the document; these things, together with the hyper-obtrusive situation of this document, full in the view of every visiter, and thus exactly in accordance with the conclusions to which I had previously arrived; these things, I say, were strongly corroborative of suspicion, in one who came with the intention to suspect.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我一瞧到这封信，立即断定这正是我要找的那封，当然，从外表的各方面来看，这跟警察局长向我们宣读的详细说明完全不同。印章又大又黑，印着D一的姓名的首字母；在原来的信上是一个小红印章，印着S一家族的公爵信章。这封信是写给部长的，字迹纤细，出自女入的手笔，那封信姓名地址抬头是某一位皇室人物，字体粗扩鲜明，只有信的大小跟原信一样。然而，从另一方面来看，这些区别的截然不同，也嫌过分肮脏；信纸污染和破损的情况，这些都跟D一实际的有条不紊的习惯那样自相矛盾，而且那样使人联想到这是在企图欺骗看到信的人，让他以为这封信没有用，这些情况，再加上信的位置过分突出，来访的每一个人完全看得清清楚楚，这正同我先前得出的结论完全一致；这些情况，嘿，对于一个抱着怀疑的目的而来的人来说，都是引起疑心的强有力的证据。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The next morning I called for the snuff-box, when we resumed, quite eagerly, the conversation of the preceding day. While thus engaged, however, a loud report, as if of a pistol, was heard immediately beneath the windows of the hotel, and was succeeded by a series of fearful screams, and the shoutings of a terrified mob. D -- rushed to a casement, threw it open, and looked out. In the meantime, I stepped to the card-rack, took the letter, put it in my pocket, and replaced it by a fac-simile, which I had carefully prepared at my lodgings -- imitating the D -- cipher, very readily, by means of a seal formed of bread.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“第二天早晨，我假托拿回鼻烟壶又去访问，我们又兴冲冲地接着前一天的话谈下去。可是，谈着谈着，又听见紧挨着旅馆的窗户下面很响地爆炸了一声，仿佛是手枪的声音，接着是一连串可怕的尖叫的声音和吓坏了的人群喧叫的声音。D一冲到一扇窗口，推开窗户向外面张望。这时候，我走到卡片架旁边，拿起那封信，放在我的口袋里，同时用一封复制的信来掉包（只从外表来说），这是我在家里先仔细地复制好的，并且仿造了D一的姓名的首字母，我用一块面团当作印章，做起来很方便。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I protracted my visit as long as possible, and, while I maintained a most animated discussion with the Minister, upon a topic which I knew well had never failed to interest and excite him, I kept my attention really riveted upon the letter. In this examination, I committed to memory its external appearance and arrangement in the rack; and also fell, at length, upon a discovery which set at rest whatever trivial doubt I might have entertained. In scrutinizing the edges of the paper, I observed them to be more chafed than seemed necessary. They presented the broken appearance which is manifested when a stiff paper, having been once folded and pressed with a folder, is refolded in a reversed direction, in the same creases or edges which had formed the original fold. This discovery was sufficient. It was clear to me that the letter had been turned, as a glove, inside out, re-directed, and re-sealed. I bade the Minister good morning, and took my departure at once, leaving a gold snuff-box upon the table.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我尽可能拖长这次访问的时间，我一方面跟这位部长极其热烈地高谈阔论下去，我深知这个题目万无一失，一定会使他感到兴致勃勃，另一方面，我的注意力其实是集中在那封信上。经过这样的观察，我把信的外表，以及它放在卡片架里的方式都牢牢地记在心里，而且，我终于发现了一个情况，使我排除了我原来感到的任何一点疑问。在仔细观察信纸的边角的时候，我看出边角的伤损超过了似乎应有的程度。信纸破损的样子，仿佛把一张硬纸先折叠一次，用文件夹压平，然后又按原来折叠的印子，朝相反的方向重新折叠了一次。发现了这个情况就足够了。我看得很清楚，这封信翻了个面，好象一只把里面翻到外面的手套，重新添上姓名地址，重新加封过。我于是向部长说了一声早安，立即告辞，可是把一只金鼻烟壶放在桌子上了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">'D --," replied Dupin, "is a desperate man, and a man of nerve. His hotel, too, is not without attendants devoted to his interests. Had I made the wild attempt you suggest, I should never have left the Ministerial presence alive. The good people of Paris would have heard of me no more. But I had an object apart from these considerations. You know my political prepossessions. In this matter, I act as a partisan of the lady concerned. For eighteen months the Minister has had her in his power. She has now him in hers -- since, being unaware that the letter is not in his possession, he will proceed with his exactions as if it was. Thus will he inevitably commit himself, at once, to his political destruction. His downfall, too, will not be more precipitate than awkward. It is all very well to talk about the facilis descensus Averni; but in all kinds of climbing, as Catalini (Catalani) said of singing, it is far more easy to get up than to come down. In the present instance I have no sympathy -- at least no pity -- for him who descends. He is that monstrum horrendum, an unprincipled man of genius. I confess, however, that I should like very well to know the precise character of his thoughts, when, being defied by her whom the Prefect terms 'a certain personage,' he is reduced to opening the letter which I left for him in the card-rack."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“D一是一个穷凶极恶的人，”迪潘回答说，“而且通事沉着。他的旅馆里也不是没有甘心为他效劳的仆人。假使我象你提出的那样轻举妄动，我大概永远不会活着离开那位部长的旅馆了，好心的巴黎人大概再也不会听到有人说起我了。你知道我在政治上的倾向。在这件事情上，我充当了那位有关的夫人的坚决拥护者。这位部长已经把她摆布了十八个月。现在要由她来摆布他了，既然他没有发觉信已经不在他手里，他会继续勒索，仿佛信还在手里一样。因此，他就免不了要弄得他自己马上在政治上毁灭。他的垮台，与其说是一落千丈，倒不如说是难堪。常言说，下地狱容易，这种话好倒是好，可是，在各种各样的攀援过程之中，正象卡塔兰尼①谈唱歌一样，升高要比降低容易得多。对于他这样除了格的人，我不同情他，至少是不怜悯他。他是那种十分残忍的怪物，一个有天才而不顾廉耻的人。不过，我得承认，等到警察局长称之为‘某一位大人物’的那位夫人公然反抗他了，他只好去打开我放在卡片架里那封留给他的信的时候，我倒十分想知道他究竟有何感想。”【注：①卡塔兰尼（Catalano1780—1849）：意大利女高音歌唱家。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The disturbance in the street had been occasioned by the frantic behavior of a man with a musket. He had fired it among a crowd of women and children. It proved, however, to have been without ball, and the fellow was suffered to go his way as a lunatic or a drunkard. When he had gone, D -- came from the window, whither I had followed him immediately upon securing the object in view. Soon afterwards I bade him farewell. The pretended lunatic was a man in my own pay."</div>
