<div class="line_en">There were four bags in a pile just outside the door. Three of them were giant, battered old suitcases covered with black imitation alligator hide. The last was an oversized zipper bag with a faded tartan skin.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Guess you can handle that one, can't you?" Hallorann asked him. He picked up two of the big cases in one hand and hoisted the other under his arm.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我想你能对付那一个，是吗？”哈洛伦问丹尼。他一只手拎起两个皮箱，把另一个夹在了腋下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Sure," Danny said. He got a grip on it with both hands and followed the cook down the porch steps, trying manfully not to grunt and give away how heavy it was.</div>

<div class="line_en">Hallorann set his bags down by the trunk of a beige Plymouth Fury. "This ain't much car," he confided to Danny, "just a rental job. My Bessie's on the other end. She's a car. 1950 Cadillac, and does she run sweet? I'll tell the world. I keep her in Florida because she's too old for all this mountain climbing. You need a hand with that?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈洛伦把皮箱放在一辆米色汽车的行李箱旁边。“这算不上什么车，”他向丹尼透露道，“租来的。我的贝茜在那边儿。那才称得上辆好车。1950年的卡迪拉克，跑起来还漂亮吗？那还用问！我把它留在佛罗里达了，因为它太老了，爬不了这么多的山。要我帮一把吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A sharp and cutting fall wind had come up since they had arrived; it whistled across the parking lot, making Danny wince his eyes down to slits as he carried the zipper bag in front of him, bumping on his knees. A few errant aspen leaves rattled and turned across the now mostly deserted asphalt, making Danny think momentarily of that night last week when he had wakened out of his nightmare and had heard -- or thought he heard, at least -- Tony telling him not to go.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们到达的时候，冰冷刺骨的秋风就刮起来了。现在，风呼啸着掠过停车场，吹得丹尼的眼睛眯成了缝，拉链包在他的膝盖上磕碰着。几片四处飘落的山杨叶刷刷作响，在空寂的柏油路上打着转儿，使丹尼一时想起了上周那个他从恶梦中醒来的晚上，当时，托尼告诉他别到这里来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No, sir," Danny said. He managed to carry it the last ten or twelve steps without grunting and set it down with a large sigh of relief.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，先生，”丹尼说。他走完了最后十来步台阶，好不容易才没有喘粗气，放下拉链包，大大地松了一口气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Good boy," Hallorann said. He produced a large key ring from the pocket of his blue serge jacket and unlocked the trunk. As he lifted the bags in he said: "You shine on, boy. Harder than anyone I ever met in my life. And I'm sixty years old this January."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“真是个好孩子，”哈洛伦说。他从蓝哔叽茄克的口袋里掏出一大串钥匙，打开了行李箱。装行李包的时候，他说：“孩子，你闪灵。比我这辈子碰到的任何人都厉害。一月份我就满60了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Huh?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“什么？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You got a knack," Hallorann said, turning to him. "Me, I've always called it shining. That's what my grandmother called it, too. She had it. We used to sit in the kitchen when I was a boy no older than you and have long talks without even openin our mouths."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你会一种窍门儿，”哈洛伦说，向他转过身来。“我，我一向把它叫做‘闪灵’。我祖母就这么叫它，她也有。我跟你差不多大的时候，我们坐在厨房里，不用开口就可以交谈。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hallorann smiled at Danny's openmouthed, almost hungry expression and said, "Come on up and sit in the car with me for a few minutes. Want to talk to you." He slammed the trunk.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看到丹尼张着嘴、急于知道的样子，哈洛伦笑了，说：“上车去，陪我坐一会儿。我想和你谈谈。”他啪地一声关上了行李箱。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the lobby of the Overlook, Wendy Torrance saw her son get into the passenger side of Hallorann's car as the big black cook slid in behind the wheel. A sharp pang of fear struck her and she opened her mouth to tell Jack that Hallorann had not been lying about taking their son to Florida -- there was a kidnapping afoot. But they were only sitting there. She could barely see the small silhouette of her son's head, turned attentively toward Hallorann's big one. Even at this distance that small head had a set to it that she recognized -- it was the way her son looked when there was something on the TV that particularly fascinated him, or when he and his father were playing old maid or idiot cribbage. Jack, who was still looking around for Ullman, hadn't noticed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在前厅，温迪—托兰斯看到哈洛伦钻进了自己的车子里，丹尼也坐到了黑大个儿厨师旁边的乘客座位上。一阵强烈的恐惧感袭了上来，她张开口，想告诉杰克，哈洛伦刚才说把丹尼带到佛罗里达去不是在开玩笑——一场诱拐案正在发生。可是，他俩只是坐在那里。她仅能看见她儿子的小脑袋的侧影，专心致志地偏向哈洛伦的大脑袋。即便离得这么远，温迪还是能认出这个小脑袋的姿势——在看特别吸引他的电视节目或者跟他爸爸玩纸牌的时候，他就是这个样子。杰克还在找厄尔曼，没有注意这一切。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the car Hallorann was saying: "Get you kinda lonely, thinkin you were the only one?" Danny, who had been frightened as well as lonely sometimes, nodded. "Am I the only one you ever met?" he asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汽车里，哈洛伦正在说：“只有你一个小孩，你会感到孤独吗？”丹尼过去经受过恐吓，也感到过孤独，他点了点头，问道：“你是不是只碰到过我一个人？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No," Hallorann said, "but you do run across them. A lot of folks, they got a little bit of shine to them. They don't even know it. But they always seem to show up with flowers when their wives are feelin blue with the monthlies, they do good on school tests they don't even study for, they got a good idea how people are feelin as soon as they walk into a room. I come across fifty or sixty like that. But maybe only a dozen, countin my gram, that knew they was shinin."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，”哈洛伦说。“但你肯定超过别的人。许多人有一点点闪灵，他们甚至都不知道。但是，在他们妻子每个月不愉快的那几天，他们总是知道送上几朵花，他们不用功也可以考个好成绩，他们一进屋就知道人们心情怎么样。这样的人我碰到过四五十个。但是，依我算来，可能只有十来个人知道他们在闪灵。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Wendy kept silent, watching Hallorann's car nervously, wondering what they could possibly be talking about that would make Danny cock -- his head that way.</div>

<div class="line_en">But he got no further. Hallorann had thrown his head back, and rich, dark laughter issued from his chest, rolling around in the car like cannonfire. The seat shook with the force of it. Danny smiled, puzzled, and at last the storm subsided by fits and starts. Hallorann produced a large silk handkerchief from his breast pocket like a white flag of surrender and wiped his streaming eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他再也不用说下去了。哈洛伦扬头纵声大笑起来，笑声从他胸腔里发出来，在车子里回荡，听上去像隆隆的炮声，震得座位直摇晃。丹尼只知道笑，不明白这是怎么回事。终于，暴风雨般的笑声平息下来，变成了时断时续的抽气声。哈洛伦从胸口扯出一张真丝手帕——大得像投降用的白旗，揩了揩淌出的眼泪。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Hallorann winced and jerked backward on the seat. His teeth came together with a hard click, drawing blood from his lower lip in a thin trickle. His hands flew up involuntarily from his lap to the level of his chest and then settled back again. For a moment his eyelids fluttered limply, with no conscious control, and Danny was frightened.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈洛伦身子一缩，向后撞在了座位上。他牙齿猛地一磕，一小股血从他下嘴唇上流了出来。他的双手不由自主地从膝上飞到胸前，紧接着又掉回了原处。有一会儿，他的眼睑颤动着，完全失去了意识的控制，丹尼害怕了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Okay," Danny said. He considered it for a moment, then gathered his concentration and flung it out at Hallorann. He had never done anything precisely like this before, and at the last instant some instinctive part of him rose up and blunted some of the thought's raw force -- he didn't want to hurt Mr. Hallorann. Still the thought arrowed out of him with a force he never would have believed. It went like a Nolan Ryan fastball with a little extra on it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，”丹尼说。他考虑了一会儿，然后将注意力聚拢，投向哈洛伦。他以前还从未做过这样的事，在最后一刻，凭着本能，他减弱了意识的这种原始力量——他不愿伤着哈洛伦。可是，他的意识仍然带着他永远也不会相信的力量，像箭一样射了出去，比诺兰—瑞安投出的一个快球还有力。">查看中文翻译</div>

Then he'd think, what if I get caught? Then he'd think, I really want it. Then he'd think about getting caught again. He was making himself sick about it, and he was making me sick. Mommy was talking to the man who sells the shoes so I went over and said, `Kid, don't take that radio. Go away.' And he got really scared. He went away fast."</div>

I remember just four years ago I had a job cookin at a boys' camp up in Maine on Long Lake. So I am sittin by the boarding gate at Logan Airport in Boston, just waiting to get on my flight, and I start to smell oranges. For the first time in maybe five years. So I say to myself, 'My God, what's comin on this crazy late show now?' and I got down to the bathroom and sat on one of the toilets to be private. I never did black out, but I started to get this feelin, stronger and stronger, that my plane was gonna crash. Then the feeling went away, and the smell of oranges, and I knew it was over.
