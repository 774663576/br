<div class="line_en">"I wanted to talk to you. Professor," Harry said quickly, looking at Dumbledore, who gave him a swift, searching look. "Wait here for me, Harry," he said. "Our examination of the grounds will not take long."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“教授，我想跟你谈谈。”哈利看着邓布利多急促地说，邓布利多敏锐地看了他一眼。“你在这里等我吧，我们查看场地用不了多长时间。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你好，福克斯。”哈利说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They trooped out in silence past him and closed the door. After a minute or so, Harry heard the clunks of Moody's wooden leg growing fainter in the corridor below. He looked around.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="三个人默默地从哈利身边走出去，关上了房门。一分钟后，哈利听到穆迪的木头假腿在楼下走廊里渐渐远去。他开始环顾四周。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry sat down in a chair in front of Dumbledore's desk. For several minutes, he sat and watched the old headmasters and headmistresses snoozing in their frames, thinking about what he had just heard, and running his fingers over his scar. It had stopped hurting now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利在邓布利多书桌前面的一把椅子上坐下。有那么几分钟，他坐在那里望着那些在镜框里打鼾的老校长们，想着他刚才听到的话，一边用手抚摸着他的伤疤，伤疤现在已经不疼了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He felt much calmer, somehow, now that he was in Dumbledore's office, knowing he would shortly be telling him about the dream. Harry looked up at the walls behind the desk. The patched and ragged Sorting Hat was standing on a shelf. A glass case next to it held a magnificent silver sword with large rubies set into the hilt, which Harry recognized as the one he himself had pulled out of the Sorting Hat in his second year. The sword had once belonged to Godric Gryffindor, founder of Harry's House. He was gazing at it, remembering how it had come to his aid when he had thought all hope was lost, when he noticed a patch of silvery light, dancing and shimmering on the glass case. He looked around for the source of the light and saw a sliver of silver-white shining brightly from within a black cabinet behind him, whose door had not been closed properly. Harry hesitated, glanced at Fawkes, then got up, walked across the office, and pulled open the cabinet door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="置身于邓布利多的办公室，而且知道马上就可以把那个梦告诉校长，哈利感觉平静多了。他朝桌子后面的墙上看去，那顶破旧的、打着补丁的分院帽搁在架子上。旁边一个玻璃匣子里放着一把银光闪闪的宝剑，剑柄上镶着大颗的红宝石。哈利认出这正是他二年级时从分院帽里抽出的那把宝剑。它曾经属于哈利他们学院的创始人戈德里克·格兰芬多。哈利凝视着它，想起当他感到一切都完了的时候，是这把剑救了他。忽然，他发现玻璃匣子有一片银光在闪烁。他回头寻找亮光的来源，发现身后一个黑柜子的门没有关好，里面透出了明亮的银光。哈利迟疑了一下，看了看福克斯，然后起身走过去，拉开了柜门。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Fawkes, Professor Dumbledore's phoenix, was standing on his golden perch beside the door. The size of a swan, with magnificent scarlet-and-gold plumage, he swished his long tail and blinked benignly at Harry.</div>

<div class="line_en">He wanted to touch it, to find out what it felt like, but nearly four years' experience of the magical world told him that sticking his hand into a bowl full of some unknown substance was a very stupid thing to do. He therefore pulled his wand out of the inside of his robes, cast a nervous look around the office, looked back at the contents of the basin, and prodded them. The surface of the silvery stuff inside the basin began to swirl very fast.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他想碰碰它，看会是什么感觉。但在魔法世界将近四年的经验告诉他，把手伸进盛满未知物体的盆里是非常愚蠢的。于是他从袍子里抽出魔杖，紧张地看了看四周，然后对着盆里的物体戳了戳。银色物体的表面旋转得快了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry bent closer, his head right inside the cabinet. The silvery substance had become transparent; it looked like glass. He looked down into it expecting to see the stone bottom of the basin -- and saw instead an enormous room below the surface of the mysterious substance, a room into which he seemed to be looking through a circular window in the ceiling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利俯下身，脑袋完全伸进了柜子里。银色物体变得透明了，看上去像玻璃一样。他使劲往里面看，以为会看见石盆的底——可那神秘物质的表面下却是一间很大的屋子，他好像在通过一个圆形的天窗朝屋子里看。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A shallow stone basin lay there, with odd carvings around the edge: runes and symbols that Harry did not recognize. The silvery light was coming from the basin's contents, which were like nothing Harry had ever seen before. He could not tell whether the substance was liquid or gas. It was a bright, whitish silver, and it was moving ceaselessly; the surface of it became ruffled like water beneath wind, and then, like clouds, separated and swirled smoothly. It looked like light made liquid -- or like wind made solid -- Harry couldn't make up his mind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="柜子里有一个浅浅的石盆，盆口有奇形怪状的雕刻：全是哈利不认识的字母和符号。银光就是由盆里的东西发出来的，哈利从没见过这样的东西。他搞不清它是液体还是气体。它像一块明亮的白银，但在不停地流动，像水面在微风中泛起涟漪，又像云朵那样飘逸地散开、柔和地旋转。它像是化为液体的光——又像是凝成固体的风——哈利无法作出判断。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Where was this place? It surely wasn't Hogwarts; he had never seen a room like that here in the castle. Moreover, the crowd in the mysterious room at the bottom of the basin was comprised of adults, and Harry knew there were not nearly that many teachers at Hogwarts. They seemed, he thought, to be waiting for something; even though he could only see the tops of their hats, all of their faces seemed to be pointing in one direction, and none of them were talking to one another.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是什么地方？肯定不是霍格沃茨，他在城堡中从没见过这样的房间。此外，盆底的神秘房间中的那些人都是成年人，哈利知道霍格沃茨绝没有那么多教师。他想这些人一定是在等待着什么，尽管他只能看见他们的帽顶，但所有人的脸似乎都朝着同一个方向，而且没有人说话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The room was dimly lit; he thought it might even be underground, for there were no windows, merely torches in brackets such as the ones that illuminated the walls of Hogwarts. Lowering his face so that his nose was a mere inch away from the glassy substance, Harry saw that rows and rows of witches and wizards were seated around every wall on what seemed to be benches rising in levels. An empty chair stood in the very center of the room. There was something about the chair that gave Harry an ominous feeling. Chains encircled the arms of it, as though its occupants were usually tied to it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="屋里光线昏暗，他想那可能是在地下，因为四周没有窗户，只有像霍格沃茨那样的插在墙壁支架上的火把。哈利把脸凑近一些，鼻子离玻璃状物质只有一英寸了。他看到一排排的巫师坐在四周的阶梯式长凳上，屋子正中央摆着一张空椅子。这椅子使哈利有一种不祥的感觉，因为它的扶手上缠着锁链，好像是绑人用的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dumbledore's office gave an almighty lurch -- Harry was thrown forward and pitched headfirst into the substance inside the basin -</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓布利多的办公室突然倾倒过来——哈利的身体朝前一冲，头朝下栽进了盆里——">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The basin being circular, and the room he was observing square, Harry could not make out what was going on in the corners of it. He leaned even closer, tilting his head, trying to see…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="盆是圆形的，而那间屋子是方形的，哈利看不到角落里的情况。他凑得更近一点儿，歪着脑袋，努力想看清楚…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But his head did not hit the stone bottom. He was falling through something icy-cold and black; it was like being sucked into a dark whirlpool -</div>

<div class="line_en">And suddenly, Harry found himself sitting on a bench at the end of the room inside the basin, a bench raised high above the others. He looked up at the high stone ceiling, expecting to see the circular window through which he had just been staring, but there was nothing there but dark, solid stone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然，哈利发现自己坐在盆底那间屋子顶头的一张长凳上，它比别的凳子都高。他抬头仰望高高的石头天花板，想找到那个圆形的天窗，可是看到的只有暗黑、坚固的石块。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Breathing hard and fast. Harry looked around him. Not one of the witches and wizards in the room (and there were at least two hundred of them) was looking at him. Not one of them seemed to have noticed that a fourteen-year-old boy had just dropped from the ceiling into their midst. Harry turned to the wizard next to him on the bench and uttered a loud cry of surprise that reverberated around the silent room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利的呼吸紧张而急促。他扫视四周，没有一个巫师在看着他（屋里至少有两百个巫师），似乎没有人注意到一个十四岁的男孩刚刚从天花板上掉到了他们中间。哈利朝他旁边的那位巫师一望，不禁惊叫起来，叫声在肃静的屋子中回响。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But Dumbledore didn't move or speak. He ignored Harry completely. Like every other wizard on the benches, he was staring into the far corner of the room, where there was a door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可邓布利多没有动也没有说话，他根本就没有理睬哈利。他像长凳上的其他巫师一样盯着远处的屋角，那里有一扇门。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry gazed, nonplussed, at Dumbledore, then around at the silently watchful crowd, then back at Dumbledore. And then it dawned on him…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利迷惑地望着邓布利多，再望望那些沉默等候的众人，然后又望望邓布利多。他突然想起来了…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was sitting right next to Albus Dumbledore.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他旁边的那人正是阿不思·邓布利多。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry raised his right hand, hesitated, and then waved it energetically in from of Dumbledore's face. Dumbledore did not blink, look around at Harry, or indeed move at all. And that, in Harry's opinion, settled the matter. Dumbledore wouldn't ignore him like that. He was inside a memory, and this was not the present-day Dumbledore. Yet it couldn't be that long ago… the Dumbledore sitting next to him now was silver-haired, just like the present-day Dumbledore. But what was this place? What were all these wizards waiting for?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利举起右手，犹豫了一下，然后在邓布利多面前用力挥了挥。邓布利多没有眨眼，也没有扭头看哈利，他一动也没动。哈利认为这便充分证明了自己的想法是正确的。邓布利多不会对他这样视而不见的。他此刻是在回忆里，这不是现在的邓布利多。但过去的时间可能不太久…他身边的邓布利多和现在一样满头银发。可这是什么地方呢？这些巫师在等什么呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Professor!" Harry said in a kind of strangled whisper. "I'm sorry -- I didn't mean to -- I was just looking at that basin in your cabinet -- I -- where are we?"</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="以前，哈利也曾到过一个地方，那里的人看不到他，也听不到他说话。那一次，他是通过一本施了魔法的日记本里的某一页掉进了另一个人的回忆中…如果他没有搞错的话，现在这种事再次发生了…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Before Harry could reach any conclusions about the place in which they were, he heard footsteps. The door in the corner of the dungeon opened and three people entered -- or at least one man, flanked by two dementors.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利还没有想出这是什么地方，便听到了一阵脚步声。地牢拐角的门开了，走进来三个人——至少有一个是人，被两个摄魂怪挟持着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry looked around more carefully. The room, as he had suspected when observing it from above, was almost certainly underground -- more of a dungeon than a room, he thought. There was a bleak and forbidding air about the place; there were no pictures on the walls, no decorations at all; just these serried rows of benches, rising in levels all around the room, all positioned so that they had a clear view of that chair with the chains on its arms.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利仔细地打量四周。正如他从上面望下来时猜想的那样，这间屋子几乎可以肯定是在地下——他觉得它更像一个地牢。屋里有一种惨淡阴森的气氛，墙上没有图画，没有任何装饰，只有四面那一排排密密的长凳，阶梯式地排上去，从所有的位子都能清楚地看到那把带锁链的椅子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry's insides went cold. The dementors -- tall, hooded creatures whose faces were concealed -- were gliding slowly toward the chair in the center of the room, each grasping one of the man's arms with their dead and rotten-looking hands. The man between them looked as though he was about to faint, and Harry couldn't blame him… he knew the dementors could not touch him inside a memory, but he remembered their power only too well. The watching crowd recoiled slightly as the dementors placed the man in the chained chair and glided back out of the room. The door swung shut behind them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利的五脏六腑顿时变得冰凉。那两个摄魂怪——那两个面孔被兜帽遮着的高大怪物——缓缓朝屋子中央的扶手椅走去，腐烂的死人般的双手紧抓着中间那人的胳膊。那个人看上去快要晕倒了，哈利觉得这不能怪他…虽然哈利知道在回忆中摄魂怪伤害不到他，但他对它们的威力印象太深了，至今心有余悸。周围的人都显得有点胆怯，摄魂怪把那人放进带锁链的椅子上，缓步走出房间，房门关上了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Igor Karkaroff," said a curt voice to Harry's left. Harry looked around and saw Mr. Crouch standing up in the middle of the bench beside him. Crouch's hair was dark, his face was much less lined, he looked fit and alert. "You have been brought from Azkaban to present evidence to the Ministry of Magic. You have given us to understand that you have important information for us."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“伊戈尔·卡卡洛夫。”哈利左边一个很唐突的声音说。哈利转过头，看见克劳奇先生在旁边那边长凳中间站了起来。克劳奇的头发是黑的，脸上的皱纹比现在少得多。他看上去精神抖擞，“你被从阿兹卡班带出来，要向魔法部作证。你告诉我们说，你有重要情报要向我们汇报。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Unlike Dumbledore, Karkaroff looked much younger; his hair and goatee were black. He was not dressed in sleek furs, but in thin and ragged robes. He was shaking.

<div class="line_cn" title="与邓布利多不同，卡卡洛夫看上去比现在年轻多了，头发和胡须还是黑的。他没有穿光滑的毛皮大衣，而是穿着又薄又破的长袍。他在发抖。就在哈利注视的当儿，椅子扶手上的锁链突然发出金光，然后像蛇一样缠到卡卡洛夫的胳膊上，把他绑在了那里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="哈利探头朝那边一看，是疯眼汉穆迪坐在那里——但他的外貌有一点儿很明显的不同。他还没有魔眼，只有一双普通的眼睛，这双眼睛正盯着卡卡洛夫。穆迪两眼眯缝起来了，带着强烈的厌恶。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And then, the dungeon returned. Harry was sitting in a different seat, still on the highest bench, but now to the left side of Mr. Crouch. The atmosphere seemed quite different: relaxed, even cheerful. The witches and wizards all around the walls were talking to one another, almost as though they were at some sort of sporting event. Harry noticed a witch halfway up the rows of benches opposite. She had short blonde hair, was wearing magenta robes, and was sucking the end of an acid-green quill. It was, unmistakably, a younger Rita Skeeter. Harry looked around; Dumbledore was sitting beside him again, wearing different robes. Mr. Crouch looked more tired and somehow fiercer, gaunter… Harry understood. It was a different memory, a different day… a different trial.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dumbledore drew his wand out of the inside of his robes and placed the tip into his own silvery hair, near his temple. When he took the wand away, hair seemed to be clinging to it -- but then Harry saw that it was in fact a glistening strand of the same strange silvery-white substance that filled the Pensieve. Dumbledore added this fresh thought to the basin, and Harry, astonished, saw his own face swimming around the surface of the bowl. Dumbledore placed his long hands on either side of the Pensieve and swirled it, rather as a gold prospector would pan for fragments of gold… and Harry saw his own face change smoothly into Snape's, who opened his mouth and spoke to the ceiling, his voice echoing slightly.</div>

<div class="line_en">"You could," said Dumbledore heavily. "I attended it many times, but some trials come back to me more clearly than others… particularly now…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可以，”邓布利多沉重地说，“我参加过许多次审讯，但对有几次审讯记得格外清楚…尤其是现在…”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry shook his head, wondering, as he did so, how he could have failed to ask Neville this, in almost four years of knowing him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利摇了摇头，心里奇怪他认识纳威将近四年了，怎么就没想到问问这件事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes, they were talking about Neville's parents," said Dumbledore. "His father, Frank, was an Auror just like Professor Moody. He and his wife were tortured for information about Voldemort's whereabouts after he lost his powers, as you heard."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，他们说的正是纳威的父母，”邓布利多说，“他父亲弗兰克和穆迪教授一样是个傲罗。你听到了，那些人残酷折磨弗兰克和他的妻子，逼他们说出伏地魔失去魔力之后的下落。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dumbledore gave Harry a very sharp look. " Has Neville never told you why he has been brought up by his grandmother?" he said.</div>

<div class="line_en">"The Longbottoms were very popular," said Dumbledore. "The attacks on them came after Voldemort's fall from power, just when everyone thought they were safe. Those attacks caused a wave of fury such as I have never known. The Ministry was under great pressure to catch those who had done it. Unfortunately, the Longbottoms' evidence was -- given their condition -- none too reliable."</div>

<div class="line_en">"No," said Dumbledore, his voice full of a bitterness Harry had never heard there before. "They are insane. They are both in St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies and Injuries. I believe Neville visits them, with his grandmother, during the holidays. They do not recognize him."</div>
