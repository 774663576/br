<div class="line_en">I ran into Accident and Emergency. The sprawling layout of the hospital and my natural lack of any kind of internal compass meant that the critical-care ward took me forever to find. I had to ask three times before someone pointed me in the right direction. I finally swung open the doors to Ward C12, breathless and gasping, and there, in the corridor, was Nathan, sitting reading a newspaper. He looked up as I approached him.</div>

His face was partially obscured by an oxygen mask and his eyes were closed. His skin looked grey, tinged with a blue-whiteness which made something in me constrict. Mrs Traynor sat next to him, one hand resting on his covered arm. She was staring, unseeing, at the wall opposite.</div>

<div class="line_en">I had been off on Friday -- in part because the Traynors insisted I was owed a day off, but mostly because there was no way I could get a passport other than heading to London on the train and queuing up at Petty France. I had popped by their house on Friday night, on my return, to show Will my spoils and to make sure his own passport was still valid. I thought he had been a little quiet, but there had been nothing particularly unusual in that. Some days he was in more discomfort than others. I had assumed it was one of those days. If I'm honest, my mind was so full of our travel plans that I didn't have a lot of room to think about anything else.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="星期五我没有上班——部分原因是特雷纳家坚持让我休一天假，但主要原因是我只有坐火车去伦敦，在“小法兰西”排队才能办上护照。星期五晚上我一回来就去了他们家，给威尔看我的战利品，也确认了一下他的护照仍然有效。我感觉他有点沉默，但没什么特别不寻常的。有些时候他比另外一些时候更不舒服，我以为那天也是这样。坦白来说，我的脑子里全是我们的旅游计划，没有太多空间想别的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I spent Saturday morning picking up my belongings from Patrick's house with Dad, and then I went shopping in the high street with Mum in the afternoon to pick up a swimsuit and some holiday necessities, and I stayed over at my parents' house Saturday and Sunday nights. It was a tight squeeze, with Treena and Thomas there as well. On Monday morning I got up at 7, ready to be at the Traynors" by 8am. I arrived there to find the whole place closed up, the front and back doors locked. There was no note. I stood under the front porch and rang Nathan's phone three times without an answer. Mrs Traynor's phone was set to voicemail. Finally, as I sat on the steps for forty-five minutes, Nathan's text arrived.</div>

<div class="line_en">The consultant came round, but I didn't feel that I could follow him in while Will's mother was in there. When he emerged, fifteen minutes later, Mrs Traynor came out behind him. I'm not sure if she told me simply because she had to talk to somebody, and I was the only person available, but she said in a voice thick with relief that the consultant was fairly confident that they had got the infection under control. It had been a particularly virulent bacterial strain. It was lucky that Will had gone to hospital when he had. Her "or…" hung in the silence between us.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="医师来了，但我觉得既然威尔的母亲在那儿，我不能跟医师进去。十五分钟后他又出现了，特雷纳夫人在他身后。我不知道她告诉我是不是仅仅因为她需要跟人说说，我又是唯一在场的，不过她沙哑的声音中带着一丝宽慰，她说医生相当确信感染得到了控制。这是一种致命的菌株，很幸运威尔感染后就来了医院。“否则……”她没有说完，这个词悬荡在我们之间。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Just occasionally, something like understanding passed between me and Mrs Traynor.

I think she had aged ten years in the time that I had been with them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="偶尔，我和特雷纳夫人之间也会互相体谅。她的脸色突然温和了一些——不再是那副惯常的死板的表情——我突然意识到她有多么的累。我觉得我跟他们在一起的这段时间，她老了十岁。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After she'd gone I went in, closing the door behind me, and sat down beside him.

Then I told myself to stop thinking about death.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她离开后我走了进去，关上身后的门，坐在威尔旁边。他表情很茫然，似乎我认识的那个威尔去某个地方短期旅行了，只剩下了一个躯壳。我不知道人们死时是不是这样。而后我告诉自己不要再想死亡这件事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It's an easy thing to say. But I had a lot of time to think, in that hospital room. I thought about Will and the frightening speed with which he had become dangerously ill. I thought about Patrick, and the fact that even as I had collected my things from his flat, unpeeled and rolled up my wall calendar, folded and packed the clothes I had laid so carefully in his chest of drawers, my sadness was never the crippling thing I should have expected. I didn't feel desolate, or overwhelmed, or any of the things you should feel when you split apart a love of several years. I felt quite calm, and a bit sad and perhaps a little guilty -- both at my part in the split, and the fact that I didn't feel the things I probably should. I had sent him two text messages, to say I was really, really sorry, and that I hoped he would do really well in the Xtreme Viking. But he hadn't replied.</div>

<div class="line_en">After an hour, I leant over, lifted the blanket from Will's arm, and there, pale brown against the white sheet, lay his hand. A cannula was taped to the back of it with surgical tape. When I turned it over, the scars were still livid on his wrists. I wondered, briefly, if they would ever fade, or if he would be permanently reminded of what he had tried to do.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个小时后，我俯下身，掀开盖住威尔手臂的毯子，他浅褐色的手显露在白色的床单上。手背上用医用胶布绑着一根插管。我把他的手翻过来，手腕上的伤疤仍然乌青发紫。不知道这些伤疤是否会退去，不然它们会永远提醒他曾尝试做过的事情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I took his fingers gently in mine and closed my own around them. They were warm, the fingers of someone very much living. I was so oddly reassured by how they felt in my own that I kept them there, gazing at them, at the calluses that told of a life not entirely lived behind a desk, at the pink seashell nails that would always have to be trimmed by somebody else.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我轻柔地将他的手指放进我的手中，包住它们。他的手指很温暖，一个活着的人的手指。握住它们让我很安心，我一直握着，凝视它们，看着那些茧块，它们诉说着一个人的人生，这个人并没有完全在一张办公桌后面生活，我看着他粉红色的指甲，总是要由别人帮忙剪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I traced his knuckles with my finger. Some small part of me wondered whether I should be embarrassed if Will opened his eyes at this point, but I couldn't feel it. I felt with some certainty that it was good for him to have his hand in mine. Hoping that in some way, through the barrier of his drugged sleep, he knew this too, I closed my eyes and waited.</div>

As I did so I had to fight a peculiar and rising feeling of panic. A subversive little voice kept rising up inside me, saying, This is how it would feel if he were dead. To drown it out, I turned on the radio, trying to bring the annexe back to life. I did some cleaning, made Will's bed with fresh sheets and picked some flowers from the garden, which I put in the living room.

I stared at the passport that I had queued to collect, remembering my mounting sense of excitement even as I sat on the train heading into the city, and for the first time since I had embarked upon my plan, I felt properly despondent. There were just over three weeks to go, and I had failed. My contract was due to end, and I had done nothing to noticeably change Will's mind. I was afraid to even ask Mrs Traynor where on earth we went from here. I felt suddenly overwhelmed. I dropped my head into my hands and, in the silent little house, I left it there.</div>
