<div class="line_en">This letter must make its way to Emma's feelings. She was obliged, in spite of her previous determination to the contrary, to do it all the justice that Mrs. Weston foretold. As soon as she came to her own name, it was irresistible; every line relating to herself was interesting, and almost every line agreeable; and when this charm ceased, the subject could still maintain itself, by the natural return of her former regard for the writer, and the very strong attraction which any picture of love must have for her at that moment. She never stopt till she had gone through the whole; and though it was impossible not to feel that he had been wrong, yet he had been less wrong than she had supposed -- and he had suffered, and was very sorry -- and he was so grateful to Mrs. Weston, and so much in love with Miss Fairfax, and she was so happy herself, that there was no being severe; and could he have entered the room, she must have shaken hands with him as heartily as ever.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I perfectly agree with you, sir,"-- was then his remark. "You did behave very shamefully. You never wrote a truer line." And having gone through what immediately followed of the basis of their disagreement, and his persisting to act in direct opposition to Jane Fairfax's sense of right, he made a fuller pause to say, "This is very bad.-- He had induced her to place herself, for his sake, in a situation of extreme difficulty and uneasiness, and it should have been his first object to prevent her from suffering unnecessarily.-- She must have had much more to contend with, in carrying on the correspondence, than he could. He should have respected even unreasonable scruples, had there been such; but hers were all reasonable. We must look to her one fault, and remember that she had done a wrong thing in consenting to the engagement, to bear that she should have been in such a state of punishment."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我完全同意你的说法，先生，”他这么说道。“你的行为的确很可耻。你这话说得再真实不过了。”信上紧接着谈到他们不和的原因，谈到弗兰克·邱吉尔坚持反对简·费尔法克斯的是非观，奈特利先生看完之后，停下来发了一通议论：“这太不像话了。他引诱她为了他的缘故，把自己置于一个极其困难、极其尴尬的局面，他的首要责任应该是不让她忍受不必要的痛苦。为了保持通信，简的困难肯定比他的多得多。即使简是平白无故地多虑，他也该尊重才是，何况她的顾虑全是合情合理的。我们得看到她的一个缺点，还得记住她同意订婚是做了一件错事，因而应该受到这样的惩罚。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The subject followed; it was in plain, unaffected, gentlemanlike English, such as Mr. Knightley used even to the woman he was in love with, how to be able to ask her to marry him, without attacking the happiness of her father. Emma's answer was ready at the first word. "While her dear father lived, any change of condition must be impossible for her. She could never quit him." Part only of this answer, however, was admitted. The impossibility of her quitting her father, Mr. Knightley felt as strongly as herself; but the inadmissibility of any other change, he could not agree to. He had been thinking it over most deeply, most intently; he had at first hoped to induce Mr. Woodhouse to remove with her to Donwell; he had wanted to believe it feasible, but his knowledge of Mr. Woodhouse would not suffer him to deceive himself long; and now he confessed his persuasion, that such a transplantation would be a risk of her father's comfort, perhaps even of his life, which must not be hazarded. Mr. Woodhouse taken from Hartfield!-- No, he felt that it ought not to be attempted. But the plan which had arisen on the sacrifice of this, he trusted his dearest Emma would not find in any respect objectionable; it was, that he should be received at Hartfield; that so long as her father's happiness in other words his life -- required Hartfield to continue her home, it should be his likewise.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是就谈起了这个问题。那是用明白、朴实而又不失优雅的英语谈的，奈特利先生甚至对自己的情人也用这样的语言说话。他谈的是怎样才能让她嫁给他，而又不引起她父亲的不快活。爱玛一听就作出了回答。“只要我亲爱的父亲还在世，我就不可能改变现在的状况。我决不能离开他。”然而，这个回答只有一半可以接受。她不可能离开她父亲，奈特利先生跟她一样深有同感。但是说不能有其他任何改变，他却不能同意。他已经非常深入、非常专注地考虑过这个问题了。起初，他希望劝说伍德豪斯先生跟女儿一起住到当维尔，他原以为这是行得通的，可他了解伍德豪斯先生，不能总是自己骗自己。现在他承认，要劝说她父亲换个地方，搞不好会危及他的安乐，甚至他的性命，万万使不得。让伍德豪斯先生离开哈特菲尔德！不，他觉得不能这么做。然而，为了舍弃这个办法而想出来的另一计划，他相信他最亲爱的爱玛说什么也不会有意见，那就是他搬到哈特菲尔德来。只要她父亲的安乐——或者说为了她父亲的性命，需要她继续以哈特菲尔德为家，那就只能让她以哈特菲尔德为家。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Of their all removing to Donwell, Emma had already had her own passing thoughts. Like him, she had tried the scheme and rejected it; but such an alternative as this had not occurred to her. She was sensible of all the affection it evinced. She felt that, in quitting Donwell, he must be sacrificing a great deal of independence of hours and habits; that in living constantly with her father, and in no house of his own, there would be much, very much, to be borne with. She promised to think of it, and advised him to think of it more; but he was fully convinced, that no reflection could alter his wishes or his opinion on the subject. He had given it, he could assure her, very long and calm consideration; he had been walking away from William Larkins the whole morning, to have his thoughts to himself.</div>

Think she must of the possible difference to the poor little boy; and yet she only gave herself a saucy conscious smile about it, and found amusement in detecting the real cause of that violent dislike of Mr. Knightley's marrying Jane Fairfax, or any body else, which at the time she had wholly imputed to the amiable solicitude of the sister and the aunt.</div>

<div class="line_en">In time, of course, Mr. Knightley would be forgotten, that is, supplanted; but this could not be expected to happen very early. Mr. Knightley himself would be doing nothing to assist the cure;-- not like Mr. Elton. Mr. Knightley, always so kind, so feeling, so truly considerate for every body, would never deserve to be less worshipped than now; and it really was too much to hope even of Harriet, that she could be in love with more than three men in one year.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，到时候奈特利先生是会被忘记的，也就是说，由别人所代替。但这又不是指日可待的事。奈特利先生本人是帮不了什么忙来医治那创伤的，他不像埃尔顿先生。他总是那么心地善良，那么富于同情心，那么真挚地关心每一个人，大家永远都会对他敬重有加。况且，即便是哈丽特，要她在一年里爱上三个以上的男人，那也确实太过分了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She would have been too happy but for poor Harriet; but every blessing of her own seemed to involve and advance the sufferings of her friend, who must now be even excluded from Hartfield. The delightful family party which Emma was securing for herself, poor Harriet must, in mere charitable caution, be kept at a distance from. She would be a loser in every way. Emma could not deplore her future absence as any deduction from her own enjoyment. In such a party, Harriet would be rather a dead weight than otherwise; but for the poor girl herself, it seemed a peculiarly cruel necessity that was to be placing her in such a state of unmerited punishment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="若不是为了可怜的哈丽特，她真要乐不可支了。可是她自己的幸福似乎牵扯并加剧了她朋友的痛苦，这个朋友现在甚至要给排斥在哈特菲尔德之外了。爱玛为自己营造了一个乐融融的家庭，出于善意的谨慎，必须让可怜的哈丽特与她家保持一定的距离。无论从哪方面看，哈丽特都是个失意的人。以后见不到她，爱玛也不愁会减少一丝一毫的欢乐。在这样一个家庭里，哈丽特只会成为一个沉重的负担。但是，对这可怜的姑娘来说，硬把她置于这般田地，忍受不应受的惩罚，实在是太残酷了。">查看中文翻译</div>
