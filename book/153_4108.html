<div class="line_en">Jonathan circled slowly over the Far Cliffs, watching. This rough young Fletcher Gull was very nearly a perfect flight-student. He was strong and light and quick in the air, but far and away more important, he had a blazing drive to learn to fly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乔纳森在远崖上空慢慢盘旋，仔细观望。这个粗野的年轻海鸥弗莱契，已非常近于一个尽善尽美的飞行员了。在空中，他顽强、轻巧而敏捷。但更重要的是，他有学习飞行的炽烈欲望。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Here he came this minute, a blurred gray shape roaring out of a dive, flashing one hundred fifty miles per hour past his instructor. He pulled abruptly into another try at a sixteen point vertical slow roll, calling the points out loud.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一霎时，他飞了过来，只见一个模糊的灰色形体，从一次俯冲中翻飞出来，以每小时一百五十英里的速度，闪电般掠过他的导师。他一转身又作另一次尝试，这次是十六点垂直慢滚，一边翻滚一边大声数着点。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="弗莱契一失败，就沉不住气，怒气冲冲，这会儿想在最高点停住时控制失灵，情况也就更糟。他一个斤斗倒栽下来，砰地一下倒转起来，最后好容易恢复了平衡，气喘吁吁，但已落到比他导师的水平面低一百英尺的地方。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">By the end of three months Jonathan had six other students, Outcasts all, yet curious about this strange new idea of flight for the joy of flying.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到了第三个月底，乔纳森又另外收了六个学生，全都是弃儿。但他们都有一种好奇心，想探索为飞行的乐趣而飞行。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jonathan Seagull looked down at him and nodded. "You'll never get it for sure as long as you make that pull-up so hard. Fletcher, you lost forty miles an hour in the entry! You have to be smooth! Firm but smooth, remember?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乔纳森低头望着他，点点头。“你在停住时候这样用力，是怎么也不成的。弗莱契，你一开头就减速每小时四十英里！你动作要平稳些！要坚定，可也要平稳，记住了吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Each of us is in truth an idea of the Great Gull, an unlimited idea of freedom," Jonathan would say in the evenings on the beach, "and precision flying is a step toward expressing our real nature. Everything that limits us we have to put aside. That's why all this high-speed practice, and low speed, and aerobatics…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“事实上咱们每一个都是伟大海鸥的观念，一个关于自由的无限观念。”每天傍晚，乔纳森在海滩上总是这么说，“精确飞行向着表现我们的真正本质迈进了一步。任何限制我们的东西我们都要予以清除。就是因为这个原故，我们才进行这种高速和低速练习，做各种特技动作……”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He dropped down to the level of the younger gull. "Let's try it together now, in formation. And pay attention to that pull-up. It's a smooth, easy entry."</div>

<div class="line_en">…and his students would be asleep, exhausted from the day's flying. They liked the practice, because it was fast and exciting and it fed a hunger for learning that grew with every lesson.

<div class="line_cn" title="……而他的学生们全都打着瞌睡，经过一天飞行已经疲乏不堪了。他们喜欢这种练习，因为它速度快、叫人兴奋，还可以满足对学习的渴望，现在他们每上一课，这种对学习的渴望也就越大。但他们当中，包括弗莱契在内，没有一个相信，用观念飞行可能同用风和羽毛飞行一样真实。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"We're free to go where we wish and to be what we are," Jonathan answered, and he lifted from the sand and turned east, toward the home grounds of the Flock.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们有自由想去哪儿就去哪儿，想成为什么就成为什么。”乔纳森回答。说罢，就从沙滩上起飞，朝向东方，朝向鸥群的栖居之地飞去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Your whole body, from wingtip to wingtip," Jonathan would say, other times, "is nothing more than your thought itself, in a form you can see. Break the chains of your thought, and you break the chains of your body, too…" But no matter how he said it, it sounded like pleasant fiction, and they needed more to sleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你们整个身体，从这边翼梢到那边翼梢，”又有一次乔纳森又这么说，“就是你们的思想本身，只不过变成了你们肉眼看得见的形式罢了。打破了思想的枷锁，也就同时打破了身体的枷锁……”但不管他怎么说，听起来倒像是好听的故事，可他们更需要的却是睡觉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We're not ready!" said Henry Calvin Gull. "We're not welcome! We're Outcast! We can't force ourselves to go where we're not welcome, can we?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们还没准备好呢！”海鸥亨利·卡尔文说。“我们不会受到欢迎的！我们都是弃儿！我们总不能强迫自己到不受欢迎的地方去，对不对？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="刚过了一个月，乔纳森就说，现在该回到群里去了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was brief anguish among his students, for it is the Law of the Flock that an Outcast never returns, and the Law had not been broken once in ten thousand years. The Law said stay; Jonathan said go; and by now he was a mile across the water. If they waited much longer, he would reach a hostile Flock alone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一时间学生们都很苦恼，因为鸥群的法律规定，一旦成了弃儿，就永远不能回去。一万年来，这条法律从来没有被违背过。法律说留下；乔纳森说走；而这时他已经飞出海面一英里了。如果他们再在这儿呆下去，那他只好单身去对付那满怀敌意的海鸥群了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, we don't have to obey the law if we're not a part of the Flock, do we?" Fletcher said, rather self- consciously. "Besides, if there's a fight we'll be a lot more help there than here."'</div>

<div class="line_en">And so they flew in from the west that morning, eight of them in a double-diamond formation, wingtips almost overlapping. They came across the Flock's Council Beach at a hundred thirty-five miles per hour, Jonathan in the lead. Fletcher smoothly at his right wing, Henry Calvin struggling gamely at his left. Then the whole formation rolled slowly to the right, as one bird… level… to… inverted… to… level, the wind whipping over them all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这样，他们八只海鸥排成双菱形队形，彼此的冀消几乎相重，在那天早晨一起飞向东方。他们以一百三十英里的时速，穿过鸥群会议的海滩。乔纳森领头，弗莱契平稳地飞在他的右翼，亨利·卡尔文雄赳赳地在他的左翼紧跟。然后，整个队形慢慢向右翻滚，动作像一只鸟儿……水平飞行……翻身倒飞……，又是水平飞行，海风像鞭子似地打在他们每一个身上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The squawks and grockles of everyday life in the Flock were cut off as though the formation were a giant knife, and eight thousand gull-eyes watched, without a single blink. One by one, each of the eight birds pulled sharply upward into a full loop and flew all the way around to a dead-slow stand-up landing on the sand. Then as though this sort of thing happened every day, Jonathan Seagull began his critique of the flight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="鸥群中吵吵嚷嚷、熙来攘往的日常生活突然中断，仿佛这个飞来的队形是把巨刀，当头向他们劈了下来。八千只眼睛盯着看，连眨也不眨一下。八只海鸥，一个接一个，陡直向上跃升，翻了个斤斗，又兜了个圈子，以极慢的速度，直立着降落在沙滩上。接着，海鸥乔纳森开始讲评这次飞行，好像这样的事每天都发生一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It went like lightning through the Flock. Those birds are Outcast! And they have returned! And that… that can't happen! Fletcher's predictions of battle melted in the Flock's confusion.</div>

The gull who looks upon an Outcast breaks the Law of the Flock, Gray-feathered backs were turned upon Jonathan from that moment onward, but he didn't appear to notice. He held his practice sessions directly over the Council Beach and for the first time began pressing his students to the limit of their ability.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="差不多过了一个小时，长者的话才在鸥群中传开：别理睬他们。跟弃儿说话的，他也要给赶出去当弃儿。朝弃儿看一眼的，就是违背了鸥群的法律。从那一刻起，海鸥们就把长满灰色羽毛的背朝向乔纳森，但他似乎并不理会。他干脆就在会议沙滩的上空讲课，进行教练，头一次逼着学生们施展全部才能。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The voice came to him as it had in the first day that he had met Jonathan Livingston Seagull, "The trick Fletcher is that we are trying to overcome our limitations in order, patiently, We don't tackle flying through rock until a little later in the program."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="和他第一天遇到乔纳森·利文斯顿时一样，那个声音又对他说了。“弗莱契，诀窍是，我们要一步步克服我们的局限，要有次序，有耐心。在我们的课程表里，穿岩飞行这一课还要稍稍靠后一些哩。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh, Fletch, come on. Think. If you are talking to me now, then obviously you didn't die, did you? What you did manage to do was to change your level of consciousness rather abruptly. It's your choice now. You can stay here and learn on this level -- which is quite a bit higher than the one you left, by the way -- or you can go back and keep working with the Flock. The Elders were hoping for some kind of disaster, but they're startled that you obliged them so well."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，弗莱契，来吧。想一想。你这会儿正跟我说着话，那你显然没有死，对不对！你刚才干的事儿，只不过把你的意识水平改变得太快了点儿。现在你选择吧。你可以留下来，在这一水平上学习，——附带说一声，比起你原来的水平要高得多了——要不，你也可以回去，继续做鸥群的工作。长者们一直希望发生什么祸事，但他们万万没想到你会帮他们这么个大忙。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I want to go back to the Flock, of course. I've barely begun with the new group!"</div>

<div class="line_en">Fletcher shook his head and stretched his wings and opened his eyes at the base of the cliff, in the center of the whole Flock assembled. There was a great clamor of squawks and screes from the crowd when first he moved.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“怎么搞的，”乔纳森觉得纳闷，“世界上最难办的事怎么倒是使一只鸟儿确信他自己是自由的，而且可以亲自加以证明，只要他肯略微花费点时间练习练习？这样的事为什么竟会这样难呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="过了一会儿，弗莱契自己也飞入高中，面对着一群新学员，他们正迫不及待的等着上第一课。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"To begin with," he said heavily, "you've got to understand that a seagull is an unlimited idea of freedom, an image of the Great Gull, and your whole body, from wingtip to wingtip, is nothing more than your thought itself."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“首先，”他说，心情有点沉重，“你们必须懂得，一只海鸥是关于自由的无限观念，是鸥神的表象。而你们的整个身体，从一翼到另一翼，就是你们的思想本身。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="年轻的海鸥们不解地望着他。嘿，伙计。他们想，这听起来可不像是翻斤斗的规则。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Fletcher sighed and started over. "Hm. Ah… very well," he said, and eyed them critically. "Let's begin with Level Flight." And saying that, he understood all at once that his friend had quite honestly been no more divine than Fletcher himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弗莱契叹了口气，又接着说下去，“哼。啊……好吧，”他说，用批评的目光端详着他。“咱们从水平飞行开始。”说着，他恍然大悟，真的，他的朋友确确实实不比他弗莱契自己更神圣。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">No limits, Jonathan? he thought. Well, then, the time's not distant when I'm going to appear out of thin air on your beach, and show you a thing or two about flying!</div>
