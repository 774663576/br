<div class="line_en">One day, the security platoon commander asked Ye to come to the gatehouse at the entrance to the base. When she entered the gatehouse, she was surprised to see three children: two boys and a girl, about fifteen or sixteen. They all wore old coats and dog fur hats, obviously locals. The guard on duty told her that they came from the village of Qijiatun. They had heard that the people on Radar Peak were learned and had come to ask some questions related to their studies.</div>

<div class="line_en">One of the children took out a worn-out middle school physics textbook. His hands were dirty and cracked like tree bark. In a thick Northeastern accent, he asked a simple physics question: The textbook said that a body in free fall is under constant acceleration but will always reach a terminal velocity. They had been thinking about this for several nights and could not understand why.</div>

<div class="line_en">Three days later, seven children came to seek Ye. In addition to the three who had come last time, there were four more from villages located even farther away. The third time, fifteen children came to find her, and even a teacher at a small-town high school came along. Because there was a shortage of teachers, he had to teach physics, math, and chemistry, and he came to ask Ye for some help on teaching. The man was over fifty years old, and his face was already full of wrinkles. He was very nervous in front of Ye, and spilled books everywhere. After they left the gatehouse, Ye heard him say to the students: "Children, that was a scientist. A real, bona fide scientist!"</div>

<div class="line_en">It was dark by the time Ye got off work on the eve of Chinese New Year, 1980. Most people at the base had already left Radar Peak for the three-day holiday, and it was quiet everywhere. Ye returned to her room. This was once the home of her and Yang Weining, but now it was empty, her only companion the unborn child within her. In the night outside, the cold wind of the Greater Khingan Mountains screamed, carrying with it the faint sound of firecrackers going off in the village of Qijiatun. Loneliness pressed down on Ye like a giant hand, and she felt herself being crushed; compressed until she was so small that she disappeared into an invisible corner of the universe…</div>

<div class="line_en">That year, eight months after she sent her signal toward the sun, Ye went into labor. Because the baby was malpositioned and her body was weak, the base clinic couldn't handle her case and had to send her to the nearest town hospital.</div>

<div class="line_en">This became one of the hardest times in Ye's life. After enduring a great deal of pain and losing a large amount of blood, she sank into a coma. Through a blur she could only see three hot, blinding suns slowly orbiting around her, cruelly roasting her body. This state lasted for some time, and she hazily thought it was probably the end for her. It was her hell. The fire of the three suns would torment her and burn her forever. This was punishment for her betrayal, the betrayal that exceeded all others. She sank into terror: not for her, but for her unborn child -- was the child still in her? Or had she already been born into this hell to suffer eternally with her?</div>

<div class="line_en">Just then, someone knocked on her door. When she opened it, Ye first saw the guard, and then, behind him, the fire of several pine branch torches flickering in the cold wind. The torches were held aloft by a crowd of children, their faces bright red from the cold, and icicles hung from their hats. When they came into her room, they seemed to bring the cold air in with them. Two of the boys, thinly dressed, had suffered the most. They had taken off their thick coats and wrapped them around something that they carried in their arms. Unwrapping the coats revealed a large pot, the fermented cabbage and pork dumplings inside still steaming hot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在这时，响起了敲门声，开门后叶文洁首先看到哨兵，他身后有几支松明子的火光在寒风中摇曳着，举火把的是一群孩子，他们脸冻得通红，狗皮帽上有冰碴子，进屋后带着一股寒气。有两个男孩子冻得最厉害，他们穿得很单薄，却用两件厚棉衣裹着一个什么东西抱在怀里，把棉衣打开来，是一个大瓷盆，里面的酸菜猪肉馅饺子还冒着热气。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The doctor told Ye that she had lost more than 2,000 ml of blood. Dozens of peasants from Qijiatun had come to donate blood to her. Many of the peasants had children who Ye had tutored, but most had no connection to her at all, having only heard her name from the children and their parents.

<div class="line_en">Ye's living situation became a problem after the birth of her child. The difficult birth had damaged her health. It was impossible for her to stay at the base with the baby all by herself, and she had no relatives who could help. Just then, an old couple living in Qijiatun came to talk to the base leaders and explained that they could take Ye and her baby home with them and take care of them. The old man used to be a hunter and also gathered some herbs for traditional medicine. Later, after the forest around the area was lost to logging, the couple had turned to farming, but people still called him Hunter Qi out of habit. They had two sons and two daughters. The daughters were married and had moved out. One of the sons was a soldier away from home, and the other was married and lived with them. The daughter-in-law had also just given birth.</div>

Feng had the strong, solid frame of the women of the Northeast. She ate sorghum every day, and her large breasts were full of milk even though she was feeding two babies at the same time. Other nursing women in Qijiatun also came to feed Yang Dong. They liked her, saying that the baby had the same clever air as her mother.</div>

<div class="line_en">On countless days, Ye held Yang Dong and sat with the other women of the village in the yard, surrounded by birch posts. Next to her was a lazy black dog and the playing children, bathing in the warm sunlight. She paid attention especially to the women with the copper tobacco pipes. Leisurely, they blew smoke out of their mouths, and the smoke, filled with sunlight, gave off a silvery glow much like the fine hairs on their plump limbs. One time, one of them handed her the long-stemmed cupronickel pipe and told her it would make her feel better. She took only two hits before she became dizzy, and they laughed about it for several days.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="记不清有多少个晴朗的日子，叶文洁抱着杨冬同屯子里的女人们坐在白桦树柱围成的院子里，旁边有玩耍的孩子和懒洋洋的大黑狗，温暖的阳光拥抱着这一切。她每次都特别注意看那几个举着铜烟袋锅儿的，她们嘴里悠然吐出的烟浸满了阳光，同她们那丰满肌肤上的汗毛一样，发出银亮的柔光。有一次她们中的一位将长长的白钢烟锅递给她，让她“解解乏”，她只抽了两口，就被冲得头晕脑涨，让她们笑了好几天。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As for the men, Ye had little to say to them. The matters that occupied them all day also seemed outside her understanding. She gathered that they were interested in planting some ginseng for cash while the government seemed to be relaxing policies a little, but they didn't quite have the courage to try. They all treated Ye with great respect and were very polite toward her. She didn't pay much attention to this at first. But after a while, after observing how those men roughly beat their wives and flirted outrageously with the widows in the village, saying things that made her blush, she finally realized how precious their respect was. Every few days, one of them would bring a hare or pheasant he had caught to Hunter Qi's home. They also gave Yang Dong strange and quaint toys that they'd made with their own hands.</div>

<div class="line_en">Most memorable to Ye were the evenings. Hunter Qi's son was away in the city selling mushrooms -- the first to leave the village to earn money elsewhere, so she shared a room in his house with Feng. Back then, there was no electricity in the village, and every evening, the two huddled around a kerosene lamp. Ye would read while Feng did her needlework. Ye would lean closer and closer to the lamp without noticing, and her bangs would often get singed, at which point the two of them would glance up and smile at each other. Feng, of course, never had this happen to her. She had very sharp eyes, and could do detailed work even in the dim light from heating charcoal. The two babies, not even half a year old, would be sleeping together on the kang next to them. Ye loved to watch them sleep, their even breathing the only sound in the room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最令叶文洁难忘的是那些夜晚。齐猎头儿的儿子到城里卖蘑菇去了，他是屯里第一个外出挣钱的人，她就和大凤住在一起。这时齐家屯还没通电，每天晚上，她们俩守在一盏油灯旁，叶文洁看书，大凤做针线活。叶文洁总是不自觉地将书和眼睛凑近油灯，常常刘海被烤得吱啦一下，这时她俩就抬头相视而笑。大凤从来没出过这事儿，她的眼神极好，借着炭火的光也能干细活儿。两个不到半周岁的孩子睡在她身边的炕上，他们的睡相令人陶醉，屋里能听到的，只有他们均匀的呼吸声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In Ye's memory, these months seemed to belong to someone else, like a segment of another life that had drifted into hers like a feather. This period condensed in her memory into a series of classical paintings -- not Chinese brush paintings but European oil paintings. Chinese brush paintings are full of blank spaces, but life in Qijiatun had no blank spaces. Like classical oil paintings, it was filled with thick, rich, solid colors. Everything was warm and intense: the heated kang stove-beds lined with thick layers of ura sedge, the Guandong and Mohe tobacco stuffed in copper pipes, the thick and heavy sorghum meal, the sixty-five-proof baijiu distilled from sorghum -- all of these blended into a quiet and peaceful life, like the creek at the edge of the village.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在叶文洁的记忆中，这段日子不像是属于自己的，仿佛是某片从别的人生中飘落的片断，像一片羽毛般飞人自己的生活。这段记忆被浓缩成一幅幅欧洲古典油画，很奇怪，不是中国画，就是油画，中国画上空白太多，但齐家屯的生活是没有空白的，像古典的油画那样，充满着浓郁得化不开的色彩。一切都是浓烈和温热的：铺着厚厚乌拉草的火坑、铜烟锅里的关东烟和莫合烟、厚实的高粱饭、六十五度的高粱酒……但这一切，又都在宁静与平和中流逝着，像屯子边上的小溪一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One time, she put down her book and saw that Feng was holding the cloth shoe she was stitching over her knee and staring into the kerosene lamp without moving.

<div class="line_en">At first, Ye did not like sleeping on the heated kang, and often got sick, but she gradually got used to it. As she slept, she would imagine herself becoming a baby sleeping in someone's warm lap. The person who held her wasn't her father or mother, or her dead husband. She didn't know who it was. The feeling was so real that she would wake up with tears on her face.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ye examined Feng. The kerosene lamp was a wonderful artist and created a classical painting with dignified colors and bright strokes: Feng had her coat draped over her shoulders, exposing her red belly-band, and a strong, graceful arm. The glow from the kerosene lamp painted her figure with vivid, warm colors, while the rest of the room dissolved into a gentle darkness. Close attention revealed a dim red glow, which didn't come from the kerosene lamp, but the heating charcoal on the ground. The cold air outside sculpted beautiful ice patterns on the windowpanes with the room's warm, humid air.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="叶文洁细看大凤，油灯是一位卓越的画家，创作了这幅凝重色调中又带着明快的古典油画：大凤披着棉袄，红肚兜和一条圆润的胳膊露出来，油灯突出了她的形象，在她最美的部位涂上了最醒目的色彩，将其余部分高明地隐没于黑暗中。背景也隐去了，一切都淹没于一片柔和的黑暗中，但细看还是能看到一片暗红的光晕，这光晕不是来自油灯，而是地上的炭火照出来的，可以看到，外面的严寒已开始用屋里温暖的湿气在窗户上雕出美丽的冰纹了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Feng was satisfied with this answer, and went back to her needlework. But Ye could no longer be at peace. She put down her book and lay down on the warm surface of the kang, closing her eyes. In her imagination, the rest of the universe around their tiny cottage disappeared, just the way the kerosene lamp hid most of the room in darkness. Then she substituted the universe in Feng's heart for the real one. The night sky was a black dome that was just large enough to cover the entirety of the world. The surface of the dome was inlaid with countless stars shining with a crystalline silver light, none of which was bigger than the mirror on the old wooden table next to the bed. The world was flat and extended very far in each direction, but ultimately there was an edge where it met the sky. The flat surface was covered with mountain ranges like the Greater Khingan Mountains, and with forests dotted with tiny villages, just like Qijiatun… This toy-box-like universe comforted Ye, and gradually it shifted from her imagination into her dreams.</div>

Ye then received a notice: Both she and her father had been politically rehabilitated. Soon after, a letter arrived for her from Tsinghua, stating that she could return to teach right away. Accompanying the letter was a sum of money: the back pay owed to her father after his rehabilitation. Finally, at base meetings, her supervisors could call her comrade.</div>

Even though the calamity had just ended, everything was in ruins, and countless men and women were licking their wounds. The dawn of a new life was already evident. Students with children of their own appeared on college campuses; bookstores sold out of famous literary works; technological innovation became the focus in factories; and scientific research now enjoyed a sacred halo. Science and technology were the only keys to opening the door to the future, and people approached science with the faith and sincerity of elementary school students. Though their efforts were naïve, they were also down-to-earth. At the first National Conference on Science, Guo Moruo, president of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, declared that it was the season of rebirth and renewal for China's battered science establishment.</div>

After the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh CPC Central Committee, he was soon promoted to the level of a deputy minister.

<div class="line_en">Ye recognized them from a distance because they were all dressed in now-rare green military uniforms. When they came closer, she realized that the uniforms were likely the same ones they had worn at that mass struggle session.

<div class="line_en">The first impression Ye had was that, though the three had once seemed to be carved out of the same mold, they now looked very different from each other. One had become very thin and small, and her uniform hung loose on her. Already showing her age, her back was bent and her hair had a yellow tint. Another had become thick framed, so that the uniform jacket she wore could not even be buttoned. Her hair was messy and her face dark, as though the hardship of life had robbed her of any feminine refinement, leaving behind only numbness and rudeness. The third woman still had hints of her youthful appearance, but one of her sleeves was now empty and hung loose as she walked.</div>

<div class="line_en">The one-armed woman said, "There was a movie called Maple recently. I don't know if you've seen it. At the end, an adult and a child stand in front of the grave of a Red Guard who had died during the faction civil wars. The child asks the adult, 'Are they heroes?' The adult says no. The child asks, 'Are they enemies?' The adult again says no. The child asks, 'Then who are they?' The adult says, 'History.'"</div>

<div class="line_en">The thin woman sighed, tears in her eyes. "Then, later, we returned to the city. But so what if we're back? We still have nothing. Rusticated youths who have returned don't lead very good lives. We can't even find the worst jobs. No job, no money, no future. We have nothing."</div>

<div class="line_en">The three old Red Guards departed, leaving only Ye on the exercise grounds. More than a dozen years ago, on that rainy afternoon, she had stood alone here as well, gazing at her dead father. The old Red Guard's final remark echoed endlessly in her mind…</div>

<div class="line_en">The setting sun cast a long shadow from Ye's slender figure. The small sliver of hope for society that had emerged in her soul had evaporated like a drop of dew in the sun. Her tiny sense of doubt about her supreme act of betrayal had also disappeared without a trace. Ye finally had her unshakable ideal: to bring superior civilization from elsewhere in the universe into the human world.</div>
