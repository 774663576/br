<div class="line_en">Main character: Humbert the Hummer. Time: Sunday morning in June. Place: sunlit living room. Props: old, candy-striped davenport, magazines, phonograph, Mexican knickknacks (the late Mr. Harold E. Haze -- God bless the good man -- had engendered my darling at the siesta hour in a blue-washed room, on a honeymoon trip to Vera Cruz, and mementoes, among these Dolores, were all over the place). She wore that day a pretty print dress that I had seen on her once before, ample in the skirt, tight in the bodice, short-sleeved, pink, checkered with darker pink, and, to complete the color scheme, she had painted her lips and was holding in her hollowed hands a beautiful, banal, Eden-red apple. She was not shod, however, for church. And her white Sunday purse lay discarded near the phonograph.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="主要人物：低吟者亨伯特。时间：六月里一个礼拜天。地点：阳光照耀下的卧室。道具：浓淡条纹相同的旧沙发、杂志、唱机、墨西哥式小古董。那天她穿一件漂亮的印花套裙，以前我见她穿过一次，裙摆很大，束腰，短袖：粉红色，深紫色条格，这组颜色系列的结尾是她涂了口红，在她凹陷的手中，握着一只美丽的伊甸红色苹果。但她没有穿去教堂的鞋子。她白色的礼拜钱包也扔在唱机边上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Give it back," she pleaded, showing the marbled flush of her palms. I produced Delicious. She grasped it and bit into it, and my heart was like snow under thin crimson skin, and with the monkeyish nimbleness that was so typical of that American nymphet, she snatched out of my abstract grip the magazine I had opened (pity no film had recorded the curious pattern, the monogrammic linkage of our simultaneous or overlapping moves). Rapidly, hardly hampered by the disfigured apple she held, Lo flipped violently through the pages in search of something she wished Humbert to see. Found it at last. I faked interest by bringing my head so close that her hair touched my temple and her arm brushed my cheek as she wiped her lips with her wrist. Because of the burnished mist through which I peered at the picture, I was slow in reacting to it, and her bare knees rubbed and knocked impatiently against each other. Dimly there came into view: a surrealist painter relaxing, supine, on a beach, and near him, likewise supine, a plaster replica of the Venus di Milo, half-buried in sand. Picture of the Week, said the legend. I whisked the whole obscene thing away. Next moment, in a sham effort to retrieve it, she was all over me. Caught her by her thin knobby wrist. The magazine escaped to the floor like a flustered fowl. She twisted herself free, recoiled, and lay back in the right-hand corner of the davenport. Then, with perfect simplicity, the impudent child extended her legs across my lap.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“扔回来，”她请求道，露出她手掌大理石般的光泽。我说“美味”。她抓过去咬一口，我的心象深红色皮肤下的白雪，而她，带着那种典型美国性感少女猴子般的机敏，夺走我虚握着打开的杂志（很遗憾没有一部电影记录过这种奇异的方式，记录过我们同时式重叠举动按字母顺序的连贯性）。她握着的不成形的苹果几乎不能阻碍她，洛迅速而用力地翻着杂志，想找到什么她希望能给亨伯特看看的东西。终于找到了。我佯装很感兴趣，把头凑过去，她的头发触到了我的太阳穴，当她手腕去抹嘴唇时，臂膀扫过我的脸颊。正因为我那画片，仿佛是透过一片燃烧的烟雾，因此对它的反应很慢，她赤裸的双膝便不耐烦地摩挲碰撞着。朦朦胧胧映入眼帘：一位超现实主义画家懒散地仰卧在海滩上休憩，他身边，反方向仰卧着一具米洛维纳斯的石膏复制品，一半埋在沙里。“本星期的画”，说明上这样写着。我把这下流东西拂到一边。立刻又假装要把它找回来，她却一下子扑到我的身上。抓住她细软、瘦峭的手腕时，杂志象迷乱的鸟逃到地上。她挣脱了我，向后一例，靠在沙发的右角里。然后，极其简短自然地，这厚颜的孩子把她的腿伸到我的大腿上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">By this time I was in a state of excitement bordering on insanity; but I also had the cunning of the insane. Sitting there, on the sofa, I managed to attune, by a series of stealthy movements, my masked lust to her guileless limbs. It was no easy matter to divert the little maiden's attention while I performed the obscure adjustments necessary for the success of the trick.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时我的兴奋已处在疯狂的边缘；同时我也疯狂地狡猾。坐在沙发上，通过一连串隐秘的小动作，我终于把我遮掩的欲望谐调进她坦诚的四肢里。为了这次阴谋的成功，我需要进行隐秘的调整，但改变这女孩的注意力却不是易事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Talking fast, lagging behind my own breath, catching up with it, mimicking a sudden toothache to explain the breaks in my patter -- and all the while keeping a maniac's inner eye on my distant golden goal, I cautiously increased the magic friction that was doing away, in an illusional, if not factual, sense, with the physically irremovable, but psychologically very friable texture of the material divide (pajamas and robe) between the weight of two sunburnt legs, resting athwart my lap, and the hidden tumor of an unspeakable passion. Having, in the course of my patter, hit upon something nicely mechanical, I recited, garbling them slightly, the words of a foolish song that was then popular -- O my Carmen, my little Carmen, something, something, those something nights, and the stars, and the cars, and the bars, and the barmen; I kept repeating this automatic stuff and holding her under its special spell (spell because of the garbling), and all the while I was mortally afraid that some act of God might interrupt me, might remove the golden load in the sensation of which all my being seemed concentrated, and this anxiety forced me to work, for the first minute or so, more hastily than was consensual with deliberately modulated enjoyment. The stars that sparkled, and the cars that parkled, and the bars, and the barmen, were presently taken over by her; her voice stole and corrected the tune I had been mutilating. She was musical and apple-sweet. Her legs twitched a little as they lay across my live lap; I stroked them; there she lolled in the right-hand corner, almost asprawl, Lola the bobby-soxer, devouring her immemorial fruit, singing through its juice, losing her slipper, rubbing the heel of her slipperless foot in its sloppy anklet, against the pile of old magazines heaped on my left on the sofa -- and every movement she made, every shuffle and ripple, helped me to conceal and to improve the secret system of tactile correspondence between beast and beauty -- between my gagged, bursting beast and the beauty of her dimpled body in its innocent cotton frock.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我喋喋不体，紧赶慢追，上气不接下气，又假装牙疼解释我断断续续的话语——所有的时候都用一只癫狂的内眼盯在不远处我金色的目标．士。我小心谨慎地增加着魔幻般的摩挲，以一种如果不是实在的，也是幻象的感觉，在两条横过我膝盖的灼热玉腿与无以言传的欲望隐蔽的膨胀之间摩挲，那感觉废除了生理上坚不可摧、但心理上异常脆弱的阻隔物质（睡衣与长袍）的质地。我在喋喋不体中，突然记起一首当时非常流行的傻歌词，我稍加改动，吟诵起来——噢，我的卡门，我的小卡门，是什么，是什么，那些良宵，还有星星，还有汽车，还有酒吧，还有酒保；我不住就这样念来念去，在它奇特的指挥下（奇特是因为改动过）制住她；我自始至终都万分惧怕，怕上帝可能来搅乱，会在我全神贯注的感觉中挪走那金色的重负，这种焦虑迫使我在差不多第一分钟的时间里行动更为犹豫，而不是对经过慎重调整的享受表现出两厢情愿。闪耀的是星，汽车停好，以及酒吧和酒保，现在都被她翻了个；她的歌声盗走并修正了我篡改过的音调。她声音美妙，甜似苹果。她的双腿稍稍蜷曲，放在我活力充沛的大腿上：我轻轻拍着；她懒洋洋地倚在右角里，几乎是仰卧着，少女劳拉，啃着她忘不掉的水果，含着果汁唱着歌，丢掉她的拖鞋，挠着她光着脚湿德德的后跟，靠着沙发上我左边的那堆旧杂志——她的每一个举动，每走一步，每出一声，都促使我一会儿隐匿，一会儿扩张在兽性与美丽之间——我令人作呕、燃烧防兽性与她纯洁的棉袍下她肢体的美丽之间——能感知的秘密。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Under my glancing finger tips I felt the minute hairs bristle ever so slightly along her shins. I lost myself in the pungent but healthy heat which like summer haze hung about little Haze. Let her stay, let her stay… As she strained to chuck the core of her abolished apple into the fender, her young weight, her shameless innocent shanks and round bottom, shifted in my tense, tortured, surreptitiously laboring lap; and all of a sudden a mysterious change came over my senses. I entered a plane of being where nothing mattered, save the infusion of joy brewed within my body. What had begun as a delicious distension of my innermost roots became a glowing tingle which now had reached that state of absolute security, confidence and reliance not found elsewhere in conscious life. With the deep hot sweetness thus established and well on its way to the ultimate convulsion, I felt I could slow down in order to prolong the glow. Lolita had been safely solipsized. The implied sun pulsated in the supplied poplars; we were fantastically and divinely alone; I watched her, rosy, gold-dusted, beyond the veil of my controlled delight, unaware of it, alien to it, and the sun was on her lips, and her lips were apparently still forming the words of the Carmen-barmen ditty that no longer reached my consciousness. Everything was now ready. The nerves of pleasure had been laid bare. The corpuscles of Krause were entering the phase of frenzy. The least pressure would suffice to set all paradise loose.</div>

<div class="line_en">I had ceased to be Humbert the Hound, the sad-eyed degenerate cur clasping the boot that would presently kick him away. I was above the tribulations of ridicule, beyond the possibilities of retribution. In my self-made seraglio, I was a radiant and robust Turk, deliberately, in the full consciousness of his freedom, postponing the moment of actually enjoying the youngest and frailest of his slaves. Suspended on the brink of that voluptuous abyss (a nicety of physiological equipoise comparable to certain techniques in the arts) I kept repeating chance words after her -- barmen, alarmin', my charmin', my carmen, ahmen, ahahamen -- as one talking and laughing in his sleep while my happy hand crept up her sunny leg as far as the shadow of decency allowed. The day before she had collided with the heavy chest in the hall and --"Look, look!"-- I gasped --"look what you've done, what you've done to yourself, ah, look"; for there was, I swear, a yellowish-violet bruise on her lovely nymphet thigh which my huge hairy hand massaged and slowly enveloped -- and because of her very perfunctory underthings, there seemed to be nothing to prevent my muscular thumb from reaching the hot hollow of her groin -- just as you might tickle and caress a giggling child -- just that -- and: "Oh it's nothing at all," she cried with a sudden shrill note in her voice, and she wiggled, and squirmed, and threw her head back, and her teeth rested on her glistening underlip as she half-turned away, and my moaning mouth, gentlemen of the jury, almost reached her bare neck, while I crushed out against her left buttock the last throb of the longest ecstasy man or monster had ever known.</div>

There she stood and blinked, cheeks aflame, hair awry, her eyes passing over me as lightly as they did over the furniture, and as she listened or spoke (to her mother who was telling her to come to lunch with her at the Chatfields -- neither Lo nor Hum knew yet what busybody Haze was plotting), she kept tapping the edge of the table with the slipper she held in her hand.
