<div class="line_en">Farid eased the Land Cruiser up the driveway of a big house in Wazir Akbar Khan. He parked in the shadows of willow trees that spilled over the walls of the compound located on Street 15, Sarak-e-Mehmana, Street of the Guests. He killed the engine and we sat for a minute, listening to the tink-tink of the engine cooling off, neither one of us saying anything. Farid shifted on his seat and toyed with the keys still hanging from the ignition switch. I could tell he was readying himself to tell me something.</div>

<div class="line_en">I patted his arm. "You've done much more than I've paid you for. I don't expect you to go with me." But I wished I didn't have to go in alone. Despite what I had learned about Baba, I wished he were standing alongside me now. Baba would have busted through the front doors and demanded to be taken to the man in charge, piss on the beard of anyone who stood in his way. But Baba was long dead, buried in the Afghan section of a little cemetery in Hayward. Just last month, Soraya and I had placed a bouquet of daisies and freesias beside his headstone. I was on my own.</div>

<div class="line_en">We climbed a few steps and entered a large, sparsely decorated house. We crossed the foyer -- a large Afghan flag draped one of the walls -- and the men took me upstairs to a room with twin mint green sofas and a big-screen TV in the far corner. A prayer rug showing a slightly oblong Mecca was nailed to one of the walls. The older of the two men motioned toward the sofa with the barrel of his weapon. I sat down. They left the room. I crossed my legs. Uncrossed them. Sat with my sweaty hands on my knees. Did that make me look nervous? I clasped them together, decided that was worse and just crossed my arms on my chest. Blood thudded in my temples. I felt utterly alone. Thoughts were flying around in my head, but I didn't want to think at all, because a sober part of me knew that what I had managed to get myself into was insanity. I was thousands of miles from my wife, sitting in a room that felt like a holding cell, waiting for a man I had seen murder two people that same day. It was insanity. Worse yet, it was irresponsible. There was a very realistic chance that I was going to render Soraya a biwa, a widow, at the age of thirty-six. This isn't you, Amir, part of me said. You're gutless. It's how you were made. And that's not such a bad thing because your saving grace is that you've never lied to yourself about it. Not about that. Nothing wrong with cowardice as long as it comes with prudence. But when a coward stops remembering who he is… God help him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们走上台阶，进入一座装潢精美的大房子。我们穿过门廊——墙上挂着一面巨大的阿富汗国旗，那两个男人带我上楼，走进一间房子，里面摆放着一对翠绿色的沙发，一台大屏幕电视摆在距离颇远的屋角。墙上钉着绣有麦加地图的祷告地毯。年纪较大那人用枪管指指沙发。我坐下。他们离开房间。我翘起脚，又放下。我坐在那儿，双手冒着汗水，放在膝盖上。这让我看起来很紧张吧？我合起手掌，觉得这样更糟糕，干脆横抱在胸前。血液在我的太阳穴里面涌动。我感到深深的孤独。思绪在我脑海翻飞，但我根本不想去思考，因为我体内清醒的那部分知道，我是发疯了，才会让自己陷进这一切。我远离妻子几千英里，坐在感觉像地牢的房间里面，等待一个凶手，我刚刚才亲眼看到他杀死两个人。这一定是疯了。甚至更糟糕，这还很不负责任。非常可能的是，我即将让年方三十六岁的索拉雅成为寡妇。这不是你，阿米尔。我体内有个声音说，你懦弱，这是你的天性。这并非什么坏事，因为你从不强装勇敢，这是你的优点。只要三思而后行，懦弱并没有错。可是，当一个懦夫忘了自己是什么人…愿真主保佑他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I glanced at Farid sitting in the car and mouthed, "I'll be back," not so sure at all that I would be. The armed men frisked me head to toe, patted my legs, felt my crotch. One of them said something in Pashtu and they both chuckled. We stepped through the front gates. The two guards escorted me across a well-manicured lawn, past a row of geraniums and stubby bushes lined along the wall. An old hand-pump water well stood at the far end of the yard. I remembered how Kaka Homayoun's house in Jalalabad had had a water well like that -- the twins, Fazila and Karima, and I used to drop pebbles in it, listen for the plink.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我看了看坐在车里的法里德，大声说：“我会回来的。”但心里却是忐忑不安。持着枪械的家伙搜遍我全身，拍拍我的腿，摸摸我的胯下。其中一个用普什图语说了几句，他们两个哈哈大笑。我们穿过前门。那两个卫兵护送着我，走过一片修剪齐整的草坪，经过一排植在墙边的天竺葵和茂密的灌木丛。远处，在院子尽头，有一泵摇井。我记得霍玛勇叔叔在贾拉拉巴特的房子也有这样的水井——那对双胞胎，法茜拉和卡丽玛，还有我，经常往里面丢石头，听它落水的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He took a seat across from me and lowered his hands on the armrests. For a long time, he said nothing. Just sat there, watching me, one hand drumming the upholstery, the other twirling turquoise blue prayer beads. He wore a black vest over the white shirt now, and a gold watch. I saw a splotch of dried blood on his left sleeve. I found it morbidly fascinating that he hadn't changed clothes after the executions earlier that day. Periodically, his free hand floated up and his thick fingers batted at something in the air. They made slow stroking motions, up and down, side to side, as if he were caressing an invisible pet. One of his sleeves retracted and I saw marks on his forearm -- I'd seen those same tracks on homeless people living in grimy alleys in San Francisco. His skin was much paler than the other two men's, almost sallow, and a crop of tiny sweat beads gleamed on his forehead just below the edge of his black turban. His beard, chest-length like the others, was lighter in color too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他坐在我对面，双手放在沙发的扶手上。好长一段时间，他一语不发，只是坐在那儿，看着我，一手拍打着沙发套，一手捻着青绿色的念珠。现在，他在白色的衬衣外面加了件黑色的背心，戴着金表。我看见他左袖有一小块干涸的血迹。他没换掉早些时候行刑的衣服，这对我来说竟然有些病态的魔力。他那没拿念珠的手不时抬起，厚厚的手指在空气中做拍打状，慢慢地，上下左右拍打着，仿佛他在摸着一只隐形的宠物。他的袖子后缩，我见到他前臂上有吸毒的标记——同样的标记，我也曾在旧金山那些生活在污秽小巷的流浪汉身上见过。他的皮肤比其他两个自得多，白得近乎病态，他的前额，就在黑色头巾边缘之下，有颗汗珠渗出来。他的胡子跟其他人一样，长到胸前，也是颜色较浅。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a coffee table by the sofa. The base was X-shaped, walnut-sized brass balls studding the ring where the metallic legs crossed. I'd seen a table like that before. Where? And then it came to me: at the crowded tea shop in Peshawar, that night I'd gone for a walk. On the table sat a bowl of red grapes. I plucked one and tossed it in my mouth. I had to preoccupy myself with something, anything, to silence the voice in my head. The grape was sweet. I popped another one in, unaware that it would be the last bit of solid food I would eat for a long time. The door opened and the two armed men returned, between them the tall Talib in white, still wearing his dark John Lennon glasses, looking like some broad-shouldered, NewAge mystic guru.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="沙发前面摆着一张咖啡桌，底座是 X状的，金属桌脚交叉的地方，拴着一环胡桃大小的铜球。我之前见过这样的桌子。在哪里？我突然想起来：在白沙瓦那间拥挤的茶馆里面，那天傍晚我出去闲逛时走进去的那间。桌上摆着一盘红色的葡萄，我摘下一个，丢进嘴里。我得找件事来想着，任何事情都行，这样才能让脑子里的声音安静下来。葡萄很甜，我又吃了一个，完全没有想到在接下来很长一段时间里面，这是我吃下的最后一口固体食物。门打开，那两个持枪的男人回来，他们中间是那个穿白色衣服的高个子塔利班，依然戴着约翰·列农式的墨镜，看上去有点像某个神秘的新世纪巫师。">查看中文翻译</div>

The Talib grinned. "One of the better ones I've seen in a while. But it really is so much better this way, I think. Don't you?" He twirled his fingers, snapped them, fist opening and closing. "So, _Inshallah_, you enjoyed the show today?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Public justice is the greatest kind of show, my brother. Drama. Suspense. And, best of all, education en masse." He snapped his fingers.

"But you want a real show, you should have been with me in Mazar. August 1998, that was."</div>

<div class="line_en">He stood up, paced around the sofa once, twice. Sat down again. He spoke rapidly. "Door to door we went, calling for the men and the boys. We'd shoot them right there in front of their families. Let them see. Let them remember who they were, where they belonged." He was almost panting now. "Sometimes, we broke down their doors and went inside their homes. And… I'd… I'd sweep the barrel of my machine gun around the room and fire and fire until the smoke blinded me." He leaned toward me, like a man about to share a great secret. "You don't know the meaning of the word 'liberating' until you've done that, stood in a roomful of targets, let the bullets fly, free of guilt and remorse, knowing you are virtuous, good, and decent. Knowing you're doing God's work. It's breathtaking." He kissed the prayer beads, tilted his head. "You remember that, Javid?"</div>

"We left the bodies in the streets, and if their families tried to sneak out to drag them back into their homes, we'd shoot them too. We left them in the streets for days. We left them for the dogs. Dog meat for dogs." He crushed his cigarette. Rubbed his eyes with tremulous hands. "You come from America?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“挨家过户。我们只有吃饭和祷告的时候才停手。”塔利班说。他说的时候神情愉悦，好像一个男人在描绘他参加过的盛宴。“我们将尸体扔在街道上，如果他们的家人试图偷偷将他拉回家，我们就连他们一块干掉。我们将他们扔在街道上好多天，把他们留给狗吃，狗肉应该留给狗。”他吸了一口烟，用颤抖的手揉揉眼睛。“你从美国来？”">查看中文翻译</div>

The Talib turned to the two men standing by the door. "That's an answer?" he asked them."Nay, Agha sahib," they said in unison, smiling. He turned his eyes to me. Shrugged. "Not an answer, they say." He took a drag of his cigarette. "There are those in my circle who believe that abandoning watan when it needs you the most is the same as treason. I could have you arrested for treason, have you shot for it even. Does that frighten you?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"It should," he said. He leaned back in the sofa. Crushed the cigarette. I thought about Soraya. It calmed me. I thought of her sickleshaped birthmark, the elegant curve of her neck, her luminous eyes. I thought of our wedding night, gazing at each other's reflection in the mirror under the green veil, and how her cheeks blushed when I whispered that I loved her. I remembered the two of us dancing to an old Afghan song, round and round, everyone watching and clapping, the world a blur of flowers, dresses, tuxedos, and smiling faces.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那是应该的。”他说，回身靠着沙发，吸烟。我想起索拉雅。这让我镇定。我想起她镰刀状的胎记，脖子优雅的曲线，还有明亮的眼睛。我想起婚礼那夜，我们在绿色头巾之下，看着彼此在镜里的容貌，对她说我爱她。我记得我们两个在一首古老的阿富汗歌谣伴奏下翩翩起舞，转了一圈又一圈，大家看着，鼓掌称好，满世界都是花朵、洋装、燕尾服，还有笑脸。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I said would you like to see him? Would you like to see my boy?" His upper lip curled up in a sneer when he said those last two words."Yes." The guard left the room. I heard the creak of a door swinging open. Heard the guard say something in Pashtu, in a hard voice. Then, footfalls, and the jingle of bells with each step. It reminded me of the Monkey Man Hassan and I used to chase down in Shar e-Nau. We used to pay him a rupia of our allowance for a dance. The bell around his monkey's neck had made that same jingling sound.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我问你是不是想见见他，见见我的男孩？”说到最后两个字时，他上唇卷起，发出一声冷笑。“是的。”卫兵离开房间。我听见一扇摇晃的门打开的声音，听见卫兵声音严厉，用普什图语说了些什么，然后是脚步声，每一步都伴有铃铛的响声。它让我想起过去，我和哈桑经常在沙里诺区追逐的那个耍猴人。我们常常从零用钱中给他一个卢比的硬币，猴脖子上的铃铛就发出同样的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The resemblance was breathtaking. Disorienting. Rahim Khan's Polaroid hadn't done justice to it. The boy had his father's round moon face, his pointy stub of a chin, his twisted, seashell ears, and the same slight frame. It was the Chinese doll face of my childhood, the face peering above fanned-out playing cards all those winter days, the face behind the mosquito net when we slept on the roof of my father's house in the summer. His head was shaved, his eyes darkened with mascara, and his cheeks glowed with an unnatural red. When he stopped in the middle of the room, the bells strapped around his anklets stopped jingling. His eyes fell on me. Lingered. Then he looked away. Looked down at his naked feet. One of the guards pressed a button and Pashtu music filled the room. Tabla, harmonium, the whine of a dil-roba. I guessed music wasn't sinful as long as it played to Taliban ears. The three men began to clap.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="相似得令人心碎、令人迷惑。拉辛汗的宝丽莱照片拍得并不像。那男孩有他父亲那张满月似的脸庞，翘起的下巴，扭曲的海贝般的耳朵，还有同样瘦削的身形。它是那张我童年见到的中国娃娃脸，那张冬天时看着呈扇子状展开的扑克牌的脸，那张我们夏天睡在爸爸房子的屋顶上时躲在蚊帐后面的脸。他剃着平头，眼睛被睫毛膏涂黑，脸颊泛出不自然的红色。他在房子中央停住，套在他脚踝上的铃铛也不再发出声响。他眼光落在我身上，打量着，然后移开，看着他自己赤裸的双足。有个卫兵按揿下按钮，房间里响起普什图音乐。手鼓，手风琴，还有如泣如诉的雷布巴琴。我猜想，音乐只要传进塔利班的耳朵，就不算是罪恶。那三个男人开始鼓掌。">查看中文翻译</div>

Mother, she prefers tennis -- Father says she has a wicked backhand. They own an Afghan restaurant and two jewelry stores; both businesses are doing spectacularly." He plucked a red grape. Put it, lovingly, in Sohrab's mouth. "So if I need money, I'll have them wire it to me." He kissed the side of Sohrab's neck. The boy flinched a little, closed his eyes again. "Besides, I didn't fight the Shorawi for money. Didn't join the Taliban for money either. Do you want to know why I joined them?" My lips had gone dry.

The bastards didn't give a reason, and they wouldn't answer my mother's questions. Not that it was a mystery; everyone knew the communists had no class. They came from poor families with no name. The same dogs who weren't fit to lick my shoes before the Shorawi came were now ordering me at gunpoint, Parchami flag on their lapels, making their little point about the fall of the bourgeoisie and acting like they were the ones with class.

<div class="line_en">"Anyway, we were crammed in groups of six in these tiny cells each the size of a refrigerator. Every night the commandant, a haif-Hazara, half-Uzbek thing who smelled like a rotting donkey, would have one of the prisoners dragged out of the cell and he'd beat him until sweat poured from his fat face. Then he'd light a cigarette, crack his joints, and leave. The next night, he'd pick someone else. One night, he picked me. It couldn't have come at a worse time. I'd been peeing blood for three days. Kidney stones. And if you've never had one, believe me when I say it's the worst imaginable pain. My mother used to get them too, and I remember she told me once she'd rather give birth than pass a kidney stone. Anyway, what could I do? They dragged me out and he started kicking me. He had knee-high boots with steel toes that he wore every night for his little kicking game, and he used them on me. I was screaming and screaming and he kept kicking me and then, suddenly, he kicked me on the left kidney and the stone passed. Just like that! Oh, the relief!" Assef laughed. "And I yelled 'Allah-u akbar' and he kicked me even harder and I started laughing. He got mad and hit me harder, and the harder he kicked me, the harder I laughed. They threw me back in the cell laughing. I kept laughing and laughing because suddenly I knew that had been a message from God: He was on my side. He wanted me to live for a reason."</div>

<div class="line_en">HE HAS GEL IN HIS HAIR and a Clark Gable mustache above his thick lips. The gel has soaked through the green paper surgical cap, made a dark stain the shape of Africa. I remember that about him. That, and the gold Allah chain around his dark neck. He is peering down at me, speaking rapidly in a language I don't understand, Urdu, I think. My eyes keep going to his Adam's apple bob bing up and down, up and down, and I want to ask him how old he is anyway -- he looks far too young, like an actor from some foreign soap opera -- but all I can mutter is, I think I gave him a good fight. I think I gave him a good fight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那人的头发涂着睹喱水，厚厚的嘴唇上面留着克拉克·盖博那样的小胡子。睹喱水浸透了绿色的手术纸帽，弄出非洲地图似的污迹。我记得他黑色的脖子上的金项链，挂着安拉的神像。他俯视着我，连珠炮似的说出一种我听不懂的语言，乌尔都语【Urdu，巴基斯坦官方语言】，我想。我的眼睛盯在他的喉结，看着它上上下下，我想问他究竟多大年纪——他看上去太年轻，像外国肥皂剧里面某个演员。但我说出口的只是，我要狠狠揍他一顿，我要狠狠揍他一顿。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">My memory of the fight with Assef is amazingly vivid in stretches: I remember Assef turning on the music before slipping on his brass knuckles. The prayer rug, the one with the oblong, woven Mecca, came loose from the wall at one point and landed on my head; the dust from it made me sneeze. I remember Assef shoving grapes in my face, his snarl all spit-shining teeth, his bloodshot eyes rolling. His turban fell at some point, let loose curls of shoulder-length blond hair.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在我记忆中，跟阿塞夫打架的情景栩栩如生，真叫人吃惊：我记得阿塞夫在戴上拳套之前打开了音乐。在某个时刻，长方形的祷告毛毯，织着麦加地图那张，从墙上松落，掉在我头上，它上面的泥土弄得我打喷嚏。我记得阿塞夫抓起葡萄磨着我的脸，他咬牙切齿，滚动着血红的眼睛。在某个时刻，阿塞夫的头巾脱落，露出几缕长及肩膀的金色头发。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mostly, I remember this: His brass knuckles flashing in the afternoon light; how cold they felt with the first few blows and how quickly they warmed with my blood. Getting thrown against the wall, a nail where a framed picture may have hung once jabbing at my back. Sohrab screaming. Tabla, harmonium, a dil-roba. Getting hurled against the wall. The knuckles shattering my jaw. Choking on my own teeth, swallowing them, thinking about all the countless hours I'd spent flossing and brushing. Getting hurled against the wall. Lying on the floor, blood from my split upper lip staining the mauve carpet, pain ripping through my belly, and wondering when I'd be able to breathe again. The sound of my ribs snapping like the tree branches Hassan and I used to break to swordfight like Sinbad in those old movies. Sohrab screaming. The side of my face slamming against the corner of the television stand. That snapping sound again, this time just under my left eye. Music. Sohrab screaming. Fingers grasping my hair, pulling my head back, the twinkle of stainless steel. Here they. ome. That snapping sound yet again, now my nose. Biting down in pain, noticing how my teeth didn't align like they used to. Getting kicked. Sohrab screaming. I don't know at what point I started laughing, but I did. It hurt to laugh, hurt my jaws, my ribs, my throat. But I was laughing and laughing. And the harder I laughed, the harder he kicked me, punched me, scratched me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我记得的大体是这样的：他的拳套在午后的阳光中闪亮，他第一次击中我时，我浑身发冷，但很快，我的鲜血就温暖了他的拳套。我被甩到墙壁，一颗本来可能挂着画的钉子刺进我的后背。我听到索拉博的尖叫，还有手鼓、手风琴、雷布巴琴演奏的乐声。身子撞到墙壁上，拳套击打我的下巴。被自己的牙齿噎住，将它们吞下去，我想起自己曾花了无数时间刷牙、清牙缝。被摔倒墙上。倒在地板上，血从破裂的上唇流出来，滴污了淡紫色的地毯，腹部阵阵剧痛起伏，想着我什么时候才能再次呼吸。我的肋骨断裂，声音跟折断树枝一样，从前哈桑和我经常拿折断的树枝当剑，像旧电影里面的辛巴德那样决斗。听到索拉博的尖叫。我的侧脸撞上电视柜的一角。又是一声断裂，这次正中我左眼下面。我听到音乐声，索拉博的尖叫声。手指抓着我的头发，拖着我向后，不锈钢闪闪发亮，它们挥击过来，断裂声再次响起，这次是我的鼻子。咬牙忍痛，发现我的牙齿已经不像过去那样齐整了。被踢中。索拉博不断尖叫。我不知道自己何时开始发笑，但我笑了。笑起来很痛，下巴、肋骨、喉咙统统剧痛难忍。但我不停笑着。我笑得越痛快，他就越起劲地踢我、打我、抓我。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"WHAT'S SO FUNNY?" Assef bellowed. Another rib snapped, this time left lower. What was so funny was that, for the first time since the winter of 1975, I felt at peace. I laughed because I saw that, in some hidden nook in a corner of my mind, I'd even been looking forward to this. I remembered the day on the hill I had pelted Hassan with pomegranates and tried to provoke him. He'd just stood there, doing nothing, red juice soaking through his shirt like blood. Then he'd taken the pomegranate from my hand, crushed it against his forehead. Are you satisfied now? he'd hissed. Do you feel better? I hadn't been happy and I hadn't felt better, not at all. But I did now. My body was broken -- just how badly I wouldn't find out until later -- but I felt healed. Healed at last. I laughed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“什么事这样好笑？”阿塞夫怒不可遏。又一根肋骨断裂，这次在左边胸下。好笑的是，自1975年冬天以来，我第一次感到心安理得。我大笑，因为我知道，在我大脑深处某个隐蔽的角落，我甚至一直在期待这样的事情。我记得那天，在山上，我用石榴扔哈桑，试图激怒他。他只是站在那儿，一动不动，红色的果汁染在他衬衣上，跟鲜血一样。然后他从我手里拿过一个石榴，在自己额头上磨碎。现在你满意了吗？他凄然说，你觉得好受一些了吗？我从不曾觉得高兴，从不曾觉得好受一些，根本就没有过。但我现在感觉到了。我体无完肤——我当时并不清楚有多糟糕，后来才知道——但心病已愈。终于痊愈了，我大笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then the end. That, I'll take to my grave: I was on the ground laughing, Assef straddling my chest, his face a mask of lunacy, framed by snarls of his hair swaying inches from my face. His free hand was locked around my throat. The other, the one with the brass knuckles, cocked above his shoulder. He raised his fist higher, raised it for another blow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着是结局，我就算埋在坟里也会记得。我躺在地上哈哈大笑，阿塞夫坐在我胸膛，一张发疯似的脸被缕缕晃动的头发围绕着，离我的脸只有几英寸。他一只手掐着我的喉咙，另外一只戴着拳套，作势悬在肩上，他举起拳头，准备再次击落。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Bismillah! Bismillah!" he said, eyes bulging at the sight of me. He slung my arm around his shoulder and lifted me. Carried me to the truck, running. I think I screamed. I watched the way his sandals pounded the pavement, slapped his black, calloused heels. It hurt to breathe. Then I was looking up at the roof of the Land Cruiser, in the backseat, the upholstery beige and ripped, listening to the ding-ding-ding signaling an open door. Running foot steps around the truck. Farid and Sohrab exchanging quick words. The truck's doors slammed shut and the engine roared to life. The car jerked forward and I felt a tiny hand on my forehead. I heard voices on the street, some shouting, and saw trees blurring past in the window Sohrab was sobbing. Farid was still repeating, "Bismillah! Bismillak!"It was about then that I passed out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“奉安拉之名！奉安拉之名！”他说，眼睛大大地瞪着我。他将我的手臂摔在肩膀，背起我，朝卡车飞奔而去。我想我尖叫了。我看见他的拖鞋嘭嘭蹬着地面，甩打着他粗黑的后脚跟。呼吸很痛。然后我看到了陆地巡洋舰的车顶，被放进后座，看到发皱的米色坐垫，听见车门打开的叮叮叮声音。一阵跑步声绕过车身，法里德和索拉博匆匆谈了几句，车门用力关上，引擎发动。车子猛然前冲，我感到额头上有只小手。我听见街道上的声音，几声呼喝，看见窗外的模糊的树朝后退去。索拉博在哭泣，法里德仍不停重复着：“奉安拉之名！奉安拉之名！”大约在那时，我昏了过去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"OUT! GET IT OUT!" he screamed. Teetering, I opened the door. The guards' eyes widened when they saw me and I wondered what I looked like. My stomach hurt with each breath. One of the guards said something in Pashtu and then they blew past us, running into the room where Assef was still screaming. "OUT!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“出去！滚出去！”他高声尖叫。我跌跌撞撞打开门。卫兵看到我的时候，眼睛睁得大大的，我在想自己像什么样子，每次呼吸都带来胃痛。有个卫兵用普什图语说了几句，接着飞也似的跑过我们，奔进房间。阿塞夫仍在里面不停喊着“出去！”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The whole world rocking up and down, swooping side to side, I hobbled down the steps, leaning on Sohrab.
