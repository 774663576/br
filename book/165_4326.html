<div class="line_en">The start of the Trisolar Crisis coincided with Cheng Xin's completion of her graduate studies, and she was selected to join the task force working on the design of the propulsion system for the next generation of Long March rockets. To others, this seemed like the perfect job: important and high profile.</div>

<div class="line_en">But Cheng Xin had lost the enthusiasm for her chosen profession. Gradually, she had come to see chemical rockets as similar to the giant smokestacks of the early Industrial Age. Poets back then had praised those forests of smokestacks, thinking that they were the same as industrial civilization. People now praised rockets the same way, thinking they represented the Space Age. But if humanity relied on chemical rockets, they might never become a true spacefaring race.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但程心对自己专业的热情早已消退。她渐渐认识到，化学动力火箭就像工业革命初期的大烟简，那时的诗人赞美如林的大烟筒，认为那就是工业文明；现在人们同样赞美火箭，认为它代表着航天时代。事实上，依靠化学火箭可能永远也无法进人真正的航天时代。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Trisolar Crisis simply highlighted this fact. Trying to build a Solar System defense system based on chemical rockets was pure lunacy. Cheng Xin had made an effort to keep her options open by picking some classes in nuclear propulsion. After the Crisis, all aspects of work within the aerospace system accelerated, and even the long-delayed first-generation space plane project was given the go-ahead. Her task force was also charged with designing the prototype for the engines that would be used by the plane in spaceflight. Professionally, Cheng Xin's future seemed bright: Her abilities were recognized, and in China's aerospace system, most chief engineers began their careers in propulsion design. But since she believed chemical rocketry was yesterday's technology, she didn't think she would get very far in the long term. Heading in the wrong direction was worse than doing nothing at all, but her job demanded her complete focus and attention. She was deeply frustrated.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="三体危机的出现使这一事实一更加明显，依靠化学动力建立太阳系防御体系简直是痴人说梦。她一度有意使自己的专业面不要太窄，选修了许多核能方面的课程。危机爆发后，系统内各方面的工作都紧急加速，曾久拖不决的第一代空天飞机项目也飞快上马，她所在的课题组同时承担了空天飞机航天段发动机的前期设计。程心的专业前景似乎很光明，她的能力得到广泛赏识，而在航天系统中，总设计师们有很大比例是搞发动机专业出身的。但她坚信化学航天发动机已是夕阳技术，置身其中，个人和团队都走不了很远，在错误的方向上停止就等于前进，而她的工作意味着全身心投人错误的方向，这一度使她很苦脑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The PIA Headquarters was located in an old six-story building not far from the UN Headquarters. Dating from the end of the eighteenth century, the building was thick and well-built, like a solid block of granite. When Cheng Xin entered it for the first time after her trans-Pacific flight, she felt a chill, as though entering a castle. The place wasn't at all what she had expected from an intelligence agency for the whole world; it reminded her more of a place where byzantine plots were hatched through whispers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="PIA总部设在跟联合国大厦不远的一幢六层旧楼中，此楼建于18世纪末，结实厚重。像是一大块花岗岩。飞越大洋的程心第一次走进楼里，感到一阵城堡中的阴冷。这里与她想象中的地球世界的情报中心完全不同，更像一个在窃窃私语中产生拜占庭式阴谋的地方。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then came an opportunity for her to leave chemical rockets behind. The United Nations began to create all sorts of agencies related to planetary defense. Unlike UN agencies from the past, these new agencies reported directly to the PDC, and were staffed by experts from various nations. The Chinese aerospace system sent many people to these agencies. A high-level official offered Cheng Xin a new position: Aide to the director of the Technology Planning Center for the PDC Strategic Intelligence Agency. Humanity's intelligence-gathering work against the Trisolarans had so far focused on the ETO, but the PDC Strategic Intelligence Agency, or PIA, would focus their efforts directly on the Trisolaran Fleet and the home world of Trisolaris itself. They needed people with strong backgrounds in the technical aspects of aerospace technology.</div>

<div class="line_en">The building was mostly empty; she was among the first to report for duty. In an office full of unassembled furniture and just-unsealed cardboard boxes, she met her boss, PIA's Technology Planning Center director.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mikhail Vadimov was in his forties, muscular, tall, and spoke English with a heavy Russian accent. It took a few moments before Cheng Xin even realized that he was speaking English. He sat on a cardboard box and complained to her that he had worked in the aerospace industry for more than a dozen years and had no need for any technical assistance. Every country was eager to fill the PIA with its own people, but much less willing to give cold, hard cash. Then he seemed to realize that he was talking to a hopeful young woman who was growing rather dejected from his speech, and tried to comfort her by saying: "If this agency manages to make history -- a big possibility, even if it probably won't be very good history -- we two will be remembered as the first to show up!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="米哈伊尔·瓦季姆，一个四十多岁魁梧强壮的俄罗斯人，说话带着突噜突噜的俄语调，程心好半天才意识到他在讲英语。他坐在纸箱子上向程心抱怨说，自己在航天专业做了十几年，不需要什么航天技术助理，各国都使劲向PIA塞人，却舍不得出钱。想到自己面前是一个年轻姑娘，他又安慰有些失落的程心说，如果这个机构以后创造了历史——这是完全有可能的，虽然不一定是好的历史一一那他们俩是最先到来的人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Cheng Xin was cheered by the fact that she and her boss had both worked in aerospace. She asked Vadimov what he had worked on. He carelessly mentioned a stint on the Buran spacecraft; then that he'd served as the executive chief designer for a certain cargo-carrying spaceship; but after that, his explanations turned vague. He claimed that he had done a couple of years in diplomacy, then entered "some department" that "did the same kinds of things we do now."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="遇到同行使程心稍稍高兴了一些，她就向主任打听他都在专业上做过些什么，瓦季姆轻描淡写地说，他上世纪曾经参加过失败的前苏联“基风雪”号航天飞机的设计，后来担任过某型货运飞船的副总设计师，再后来的资历他有些含糊其辞，说在外交部干过两年，然后就到“某个部门”从事“我们现在这类工作”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As soon as Cheng Xin walked into the PIA chief's spacious office, she was greeted by the strong smell of cigar smoke. A large painting hung on the wall. A leaden sky and the dim, snow-covered ground took up most of the painting; in the distance, where the clouds met the snow, a few dark shapes lurked. A closer examination revealed them to be dirty buildings, most of them one-story clapboard houses mixed with a few European-style houses with two or three stories. Based on the shape of the river in the foreground and other hints in the geography, this was a portrait of New York at the beginning of the eighteenth century. The overwhelming impression given off by the painting was coldness, which Cheng Xin thought fit the person sitting under the painting rather well.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="走进局长宽大的办公室，一股浓烈的雪茄味扑面而来。首先吸引程心目光的是墙上那幅大油画，广阔画面的大部分都被布满铅云的天空和晦暗的雪野所占据，在远景的深处，几乎到了云与雪交会的地方，有一片，黑糊糊的东西，细看是一片肮脏的建筑，大部分是低矮的板房，其间有几幢两三层的欧式楼房。从画面前方那条河流和其他的地形看，这可能是18世纪初的纽约。这画给程心最大的感觉就是冷，倒是很符合坐在画下那个人的形象。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Next to the large painting was a smaller picture. The main subject in the painting was an ancient sword with a golden cross guard and a bright, shining blade, held in a hand enclosed in bronze gauntlets -- only the forearm was shown. The hand was lifting the sword to pick up a wreath woven from red, white, and yellow flowers floating over the water. In contrast to the larger painting, this picture was bright and colorful, but it nonetheless radiated eeriness. Cheng Xin noticed that bloodstains covered the white flowers in the wreath.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这幅画旁边还有一幅较小的油画，画面的主题是一把古典样式的剑，带着金色的护腕，剑锋雪亮，握在一只套着青铜盔甲的手中，这只手只画到小臂；这只握着剑的手正从蓝色的水面上捞起一个花冠，花冠由红、白、黄三色的鲜花编成。这幅画的色调与大画相反，华丽明艳，但隐藏着一种不祥的诡异，程心注意到，花冠的白花上有明显的血迹。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">PIA Chief Thomas Wade, an American, was far younger than Cheng Xin had expected -- he looked younger than Vadimov. He was also more handsome, with very classical features. Later, she would conclude that the classical appearance came mostly from Wade's expressionless face, like a cold, lifeless statue transplanted out of the cold painting behind him. Wade didn't look busy -- the desk in front of him was completely empty, with no sign of a computer or paper documents. He glanced up as she entered, but returned to contemplating the cigar in his hand almost right away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="PLA局长托马斯·维德比程心想象的年轻许多，看上去比瓦季姆都年轻，也比后者长得帅，脸上的线条很古典。程心后来发现，这种古典的感觉多半来自他的面无表情，像从后面的油画中搬出来的一座冰冷的雕像。他看上去不忙，前面的大办公桌上空空荡荡，没有电脑和文件，他正专心致志地研究着手中雪茄的烟头，程心进来后，他只是抬头扫了一眼，然后，又继续研究烟头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Cheng Xin thought she saw exhaustion and laziness in those eyes, but there was also something deeper, something sharp that made her uncomfortable. A smile appeared on Wade's face, like water seeping out of a crack in the frozen surface of a river; there was no real warmth, and it didn't relax her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那目光给程心最初的印象是疲倦和懒散，但在深处隐约透出一丝令她不安的锐利。他脸上出现了一抹笑意，但丝毫没有使程心感到温暖和放松，那微笑像冰封的河面上一条冰缝中渗出的冰水，在冰面上慢慢弥散开来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She tried to respond with a smile of her own, but the first words out of Wade's mouth froze her face and entire body. "Would you sell your mother to a whorehouse?"</div>

<div class="line_en">After she told Vadimov what had happened, Vadimov laughed. "That's just a line that used to be popular in our… trade. I heard it started back during the Second World War. Veterans would use it as a joke on novices. The point is: Our profession is the only one on Earth where lies and betrayal are at the very heart of what we do. We have to be… flexible when it comes to commonly accepted ethical norms. PIA is formed from two groups of people: Some are technical experts like you; others are veterans of the various intelligence agencies in the world. These two groups have different ways of thinking and acting. It's a good thing that I'm familiar with both and can help you adjust to the other."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="听程心说完这次跟局长见面的事后，瓦季姆一笑置之，“呵呵，这是业内曾流传的一句……一句……就是一句话吧，可能起源于二战时期。老鸟常用它来调侃新手，它是说：地球上只有我们这个行业是以欺骗和背叛为核心的。对于有些公认的准则，我们应该适当地……怎么说呢……灵活一些。PIA由两部分人组成，一部分是你这样的专业人页，另一部分来自情报和军队的秘密战部门，这两种人的思想方法和行为方式很不一样——好在两者我都熟悉，我会帮助你们互相适应的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Cheng Xin shook her head no, but she wasn't even trying to respond to the question; she was terrified that she had not understood what he said. But Wade waved at her with his cigar. "Thanks. Go do what needs to get done."</div>

<div class="line_en">Two days after Cheng Xin's arrival, PIA held its first all-hands meeting, even though not everyone had shown up yet. Other than PIA Chief Wade, there were three assistant chiefs: one from China, one from France, and one from the United Kingdom.</div>

<div class="line_en">They were polite to each other, but there was no trust. The technical experts kept to themselves and acted as if they were on guard against theft every minute.

<div class="line_en">Assistant Chief Yu Weiming spoke first. Cheng Xin had no idea what kind of work he had done in China -- and he had the sort of face that took multiple meetings to remember what he looked like.

<div class="line_en">While Assistant Chief Yu was giving this speech, Cheng Xin noticed that Wade was kicking the table legs and slowly maneuvering his chair away from the conference table as though he didn't want to be there. Later, whenever anyone asked him to say a few words, he shook his head and refused.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当于副局长开始讲话时，程心注意到维德用一只脚蹬着桌腿，把自己慢慢推离了会议桌，一副置身事外的样子。后面每一个官员讲完后请他讲话，他都摆摆手谢绝了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Finally, after everyone who wanted to make a speech had done so, he spoke. Pointing at the pile of boxes and fresh office supplies in the meeting room, he said, "I'd like the rest of you to take care of these matters on your own." Apparently, he was referring to the administrative details of getting the agency up and running. "Please don't take up my time or theirs"-- here he pointed at Vadimov and his staff. "I need everyone in the Technology Planning Center with experience in spaceflight engineering to stay. The rest of you are dismissed."</div>

<div class="line_en">Assistant Chief Yu said that he understood that everyone in the PIA was sent by their own country, and so they had dual loyalties. PIA didn't demand, and didn't even hope, that they would place their loyalty to the agency above their duties to their own nations. However, since the PIA's task was the protection of the entire human race, he hoped that everyone present would at least try to balance the two appropriately.

"With those sophons zipping about at lightspeed, spying on us constantly, and completely blocking all fundamental physics research, it's no longer certain that we'll make significant technological progress in the future. If humanity is doomed to crawl at a snail's pace through space, we'd better get started as soon as possible."</div>

Not only did humanity possess such technology, the bombs were already on launch vehicles: the ICBMs in service could easily be repurposed for this use. American Peacekeepers, Russian Topols, and Chinese Dongfengs could all directly launch their payloads into near-Earth orbits.

<div class="line_en">Moreover, due to the presence of sophons, the plan for sending a probe would be completely transparent to the enemy, making its chances of successfully gathering any valuable intelligence nonexistent. Considering the enormous investment required to implement such a plan, the benefits were too minuscule. Most of the plan's value was purely symbolic, and the great powers were simply insufficiently interested. The other three permanent members of the PDC voted yes only because they were interested in the propulsion technology.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="还有一个重要原因：由于智子的存在，探测器计划从头到尾对敌人而言完全透明，使成功的机会更渺茫了。总之，相对于计划的巨大投人而言，所获甚微，更多的是象征意义，各大国对此不感兴趣。他们最感兴趣的是把探测器推进到光速百分之一的技术，正因为这一点，另外三个常任理事国才投了赞成票。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This was because the proposed probe had no way to decelerate. Even taking into account the fact that the Trisolaran Fleet would be decelerating, the probe and the fleet would pass by each other at a relative speed of around 5 percent of lightspeed (assuming the probe wasn't captured by the fleet). The window for gathering intelligence would be extremely small. Since the small mass of the probe made active sensors such as radar impractical, the probe was limited to passive sensing, mainly of electromagnetic signals. Given the advanced state of Trisolaran technology, it was almost certain that the enemy would not be using electromagnetic radiation, but media such as neutrinos or gravitational waves -- techniques beyond the current state of human technology.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因为探测器没有减速能力，就是考虑到三体舰队的减速，双方也将至少以光速的百分之五的相对速度擦肩而过（在探测器没有被敌舰捕获的情况下），探测窗口很狭窄。由于探测器的质量限制，不可能进行雷达等主动探测，只能进行信息接收的被动探测。可接收的信息主要是电磁波，而敌人的通信肯定早就不用电磁波了，而是使用中微子或引力波一类目前人类技术鞭长莫及的媒介。">查看中文翻译</div>

Four light-years away, on that distant world, other invisible beings were also "attending" their meeting. The presence of the sophons was something that people tended to forget. When they remembered it, besides fright, they also felt a kind of insignificance, as though they were a swarm of ants under the magnifying glass of some playful, cruel child.

<div class="line_en">In traditional intelligence warfare, sending a spy whose identity was known to the enemy was a meaningless gesture. But this war was different. Sending a representative of humanity into the Trisolaran Fleet was, by itself, a valiant gesture, and it made no difference that the Trisolarans would know the individual's identity ahead of time. The PIA didn't even need to figure out what the spy had to do once he or she got there: As long as the person could be safely and successfully inserted into the fleet, the possibilities were endless. Given that the Trisolarans were transparent in thought and vulnerable to stratagems, Wade's idea became even more attractive.</div>

For example, when the computer was first invented, it was merely a tool for increasing efficiency, and some thought five computers would be enough for the entire world. Artificial hibernation was the same. Before it was a reality, people just thought it would provide an opportunity for patients with terminal illnesses to seek a cure in the future.

Cloning raised moral questions, but they mostly troubled those with a moral view influenced by Christianity. The troubles brought about by hibernation, on the other hand, were practical, and affected the entire human race. Once the technology was successfully commercialized, those who could afford it would use it to skip to paradise, while the rest of humanity would have to stay behind in the comparatively depressing present to construct that paradise for them.

In the long journey through trans-Neptunian space in particular, outside temperature would be close to absolute zero. In contrast, minus-fifty-degrees Celsius was like the inside of a furnace.

<div class="line_en">One of the hibernation experts said, "You're talking about cryopreservation, not hibernation. The biggest barrier to reanimating a flash-frozen body is preventing cell damage from ice crystals during the thawing process. It's like what happens to frozen tofu: When you defrost it, it turns into a sponge. Oh, I guess most of you haven't had frozen tofu." The expert, who was Chinese, smiled at the confused Western faces around him. "Now, maybe the Trisolarans know techniques to prevent such damage. Perhaps they can restore the body to normal temperature within an extremely short period of time: a millisecond, or even a microsecond. We don't know how to do such a thing, at least not without vaporizing the body in the process."</div>

<div class="line_en">The last session of the PDC marked the first time a resolution had been passed based on a proposal that wasn't even written down. And Cheng Xin got to witness the debating skills of Wade, usually a man of few words. He argued that if we assumed the Trisolarans were capable of reviving a body in deep freeze, then it made sense to assume they were also capable of reviving a bare brain in similar condition and conversing with it through an external interface. Surely such a task was trivial for a civilization capable of unfolding a proton into two dimensions and etching circuits over the resulting surface. In some sense, a brain was no different from the whole person: It possessed the person's thoughts, personality, and memories. And it most definitely possessed the person's capacity for stratagems. If successful, the brain would still be a ticking bomb in the heart of the enemy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在那次PDC常任理事国会议上，第一次通过了一个还没有形成文本的提案，程心也第一次见识了平时沉默寡言的维德的雄辩能力。他说，如果三体人能够复活一个深冻的人体，也一定能够复活一个这样的大脑，并且用某种外部接口与它交流、对午一个能够把质子展开成二维并在上面蚀刻电路的文明来说，这并不是一件很困难的事。从某种意义上讲，一个大脑与一个完整的人没有什么区别，它有这个人的意识，这个人的精神，这个人的记忆，特别是，有这个人的谋略。如果成功这仍然是进人敌人心脏的二颗炸弹。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Cheng Xin's eyes filled with hot tears. Each ascending rocket lit them up like bright, glistening pools. She told herself again and again that no matter what happened next, it was worth it to have pushed the Staircase Program this far.</div>

<div class="line_en">At the same time, in Russia and China, Topol and Dongfeng missiles were also rising into the sky. The scene resembled a doomsday scenario, but Cheng Xin could tell by the curvature of the rocket trails that these were orbital launches instead of intercontinental strikes. These devices, which could have killed billions, would never return to the surface of the Earth. They would pool their enormous power to accelerate a feather to 1 percent of the speed of light.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="与此同时，在俄罗斯和中国，“白杨”和“东风”导弹也在不间断地发射中。这很像世界末日的景象，但程心专业的眼光从这条夫国之路尽头的弯曲度看出，这不是洲际攻击轨道，一而是太空发射轨道。那些本来可能致几亿人死亡的东西，现在一去不回了，用它们那巨大的能量去把那片羽毛推进到光速的百分之一。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But the two men beside her, Vadimov and Wade, seemed unmoved by the spectacular scene playing out before them. They didn't even bother looking up; instead, they smoked and conversed in low voices. Cheng Xin knew very well what they were discussing: who would be chosen for the Staircase Program.</div>

<div class="line_en">The other leaders and implementers of the Staircase Program did not suffer her pangs of guilt. If PIA were a national intelligence agency, this matter would have been resolved long ago.

<div class="line_en">Once the Staircase Program was approved, the problem of who should be sent came to the forefront. Cheng Xin lacked the courage to even imagine such a person. Even if his or her brain could be captured by the Trisolarans and revived, life afterwards -- if such an existence could be called life -- would be one interminable nightmare. Every time she thought about this, her heart felt squeezed by a hand chilled to minus-two-hundred-degrees Celsius.</div>

<div class="line_en">Although the PDC members did not fully agree that a brain was the same as a whole person, they lacked better choices, especially since their interest in the Staircase Program was largely based on the technology for accelerating the probe to 1 percent of lightspeed.

<div class="line_en">After the initial panic of the Crisis subsided, a mainstream consensus gradually dominated international politics: It was important to prevent the Crisis from being leveraged as a tool to destroy democracy.

<div class="line_en">One of Cheng Xin's college classmates came to New York to visit her. The talk turned to what had happened to others in their class, and her friend mentioned Yun Tianming.

Right away, Cheng Xin went to Assistant Chief Yu to suggest Tianming as a candidate.</div>

<div class="line_en">He made another logical deduction that made him laugh even harder, until it was hard to breathe. Based on Cheng Xin's timing, she could not know that he had already chosen euthanasia. In other words, if Tianming hadn't already chosen this path, she would try to convince him to take it. Maybe she would even entice him, or pressure him, until he agreed.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then they would search his memory to identify what forms of suffering he feared the most. They would discover a torture technique he had once read in a history book -- first, the victim was whipped until not an inch of his skin remained intact; then the victim's body was tightly wrapped in bandages; and after the victim had stopped bleeding, the bandages would be torn off, ripping open all the wounds at once -- then send signals replicating such torture into his brain. The victim in his history book couldn't live for long in those conditions, but Tianming's brain would not be able to die. The most that could happen was that his brain could shut down from shock. In the eyes of Trisolarans, it would resemble a computer locking up. They'd just restart his brain and run another experiment, driven by curiosity, or merely the desire for entertainment…</div>

<div class="line_en">If the Trisolarans were to really capture his brain as Cheng Xin wished, then his true nightmare would begin. Aliens who shared nothing with humanity would attach sensors to his brain and begin tests involving the senses.
