<div class="line_en">He sat down, collected his thoughts, and considered how he could lift this burden from his shoulders. For a long time his thoughts led to nothing, but suddenly it was as if scales were removed from his eyes. "I know what I will do," he shouted. "I will marry Fat Trina. She too has a goat, and she can drive mine out with hers, and then I shall no longer have to torment myself."</div>

<div class="line_en">Heinz was lazy, and although he had nothing else to do but to drive his goat out to the pasture every day, he nevertheless groaned every evening when he returned home after finishing his day's work.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利是个大懒鬼，其实他只要把羊赶出去放牧，也别无它事。不过每天放羊回家后，他总要唉声歎气：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So Heinz got up, set his weary limbs into motion, and walked across the street, for it was no further than that, to where Fat Trina's parents lived, and asked for the hand in marriage of their industrious and virtuous daughter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利马上从地上爬起来，拖着疲惫的步子，迳直穿过大街，来到了不远处的特琳娜父母家，直接了当地向他们要求把那勤劳、善良的女孩嫁给他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It is in truth a heavy burden," he said, "and a tiresome job, to drive such a goat out to the field year in and year out until late in the fall. If I could only lie down and sleep at it! But no, I must keep my eyes open so it won't damage the young trees, or force its way through the hedge into a garden, or even run away altogether. How can I get some rest and enjoy life?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这活实在太累了！成年累月都要去放羊，太乏味了！只是到了秋天才能休闲片刻，要是能躺下来睡上一大觉有多好啊！不过你休想，你得时刻睁着只眼，否则它就会损坏幼树，或穿过篱笆进入人家的花园，或乾脆跑掉。人怎样才能坐下来逍遥逍遥呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Dear Heinz," she said one day, "why should we make our lives so miserable, ruining the best days of our youth, when there is no need for it? The two goats disturb our best sleep every morning with their bleating. Wouldn't it be better for us to give them to our neighbor, who will give us a beehive for them? We will put the beehive in a sunny place behind the house, and then not give it any more thought. Bees do not have to be taken care of, nor driven into the field. They fly out and find their way home again by themselves, and they collect honey without any effort at all on our part."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哈利宝贝，”一天她对丈夫说：“我们这么辛苦干活何苦呢？简直是在虚度年华嘛！这真的没必要。那两头羊每天一清早就咩咩地叫，吵得我们睡不好觉，何不把它送给邻居，与他换一窝蜜蜂不是更好吗？我们可以把它养到屋后的阳光下，这无需我们多照看，蜜蜂本来就不需人去管，更不用赶到田间去，它们自己会飞来飞去，并且还会採蜜，一点也不麻烦。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her parents did not think about it for long. "Birds of a feather, flock together," they thought, and gave their consent.</div>

<div class="line_en">The neighbor willingly gave them a beehive for the two goats. The bees flew tirelessly in and out from early morning until late evening, filling the hive with the best honey. Thus that fall-time, Heinz was able to take out a whole jugful.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邻居拿一窝蜜蜂换来了两头羊，心里可欢喜啦！蜜蜂每天忙着飞进飞出，一点也不知疲倦，它们在蜂窝里酿满了诱人的蜜，到了秋天，哈利就聚上了满满一罐蜜。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They placed the jug on a shelf on their bedroom wall. Fearing that it might be stolen, or that the mice might get into it, Trina brought in a stout hazel stick and put it beside her bed, so that she would be able to reach it without having to get up, and then from her place in bed drive away the uninvited guests.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="夫妻俩把那个罐子摆在靠床的墙壁的搁板上，为了防小偷和老鼠，特琳娜特意找来了一根粗大的榛树棒，准备在床边，只要有动静，她一伸手便可拿到，一点也不费神，这样很快可赶走那些不速之客。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You have spoken like a sensible woman," replied Heinz. "We will carry out your proposal without delay. And furthermore, honey tastes better and is more nourishing than goat's milk, and it keeps longer too."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“言之有理。”哈利夸道，“我们说做便做，加之蜂蜜比羊奶好吃，更有营养，且保存期也长得多。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One morning when he was still lying in the feathers in broad daylight, resting from his long sleep, he said to his wife, "Women are fond of sweets, and you have been snacking on the honey. It would be better for us to exchange it for a goose with a young gosling, before you eat it all up."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天早上，日已上三竿，他还直挺在床上，这时他对妻子说：“女人喜欢甜食，你常独自一人偷吃蜂蜜，趁你还没喝光，不如拿它换只带崽的鹅来。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Do you think," said Heinz, "that the boy will tend geese? Nowadays children no longer obey. They do just as they please, because they think that they are smarter than their parents, just like that servant who was supposed to look for the cow and chased after three blackbirds."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你想小傢伙会去放鹅吗？现在的小孩可没有那么听话，他们做事只图新鲜，就像那种小孩，本让他去放牛，却去追甚么三只山鸟。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh," replied Trina, "he will get it if he does not do what I say. I will take a stick and tan his hide with more blows than can be counted."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哼！”只听特琳娜说，“如果他胆敢胡来，不听我的话，我会用棒子敲下他一层皮来，哈利，你说呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"See here, Heinz," she shouted in her fervor, seizing the stick that she intended to use to drive away the mice. "See here! This is how I will beat him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她面红耳赤地大叫着，顺手操起那根赶老鼠的根子，“瞧，就这么收拾他！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She struck forth, unfortunately hitting the jug of honey above the bed. The jug struck against the wall and fell down in pieces. The fine honey flowed out onto the floor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她伸手一敲，不巧打着了床头的蜂蜜罐。罐子猛地撞在墙壁上，碰了个粉碎，甜美的蜂蜜全洒在了地上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There lies the goose with the young gosling," said Heinz. "And they do not need to be tended. But it is lucky that the jug did not fall on my head. We have every reason to be satisfied with our fate."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“带崽的鹅就躺在这儿了，”只听哈利说，“它们再也不用人来照看了。幸亏罐子没有砸在我头上，这真是不幸中的万幸。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes," answered Trina, "there is always time enough. You know, the snail was once invited to a wedding and started on his way, but arrived at the child's baptism. In front of the house it fell over the fence, and said, 'Haste makes waste.'"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“太对了！”特琳娜应和道，“我们总会有出头之日的。你也知道，有只蜗牛曾应邀去参加婚礼，可是等别人生下了小孩，并要举行命名仪式时它才赶到，到了屋前却一下跌下了篱笆，它不是口中还说：'欲速则不达'嘛！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then noticing that there was still some honey in one of the pieces of the jug, he reached out for it, saying quite happily, "Wife, let us enjoy the leftovers, and then we will rest a little from the fright we have had. What does it matter if we get up a little later than usual? The day will be long enough."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说着，他瞧见了碎罐片上仍残有一些蜂蜜，便伸手掬起来，口里津津乐道地说：“老婆啊，剩下的这点我们可以放心吃了。担了这么久的惊，我们总算可以安宁了。起得迟又有甚么的，反正白天够长的！”">查看中文翻译</div>
