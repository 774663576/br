<div class="line_en">Amy found that housework and art did not go well together, and returned to her mud pies. Meg went daily to her pupils, and sewed, or thought she did, at home, but much time was spent in writing long letters to her mother, or reading the Washington dispatches over and over. Beth kept on, with only slight relapses into idleness or grieving.</div>

<div class="line_en">For a week the amount of virtue in the old house would have supplied the neighborhood. It was really amazing, for everyone seemed in a heavenly frame of mind, and self-denial was all the fashion. Relieved of their first anxiety about their father, the girls insensibly relaxed their praiseworthy efforts a little, and began to fall back into old ways. They did not forget their motto, but hoping and keeping busy seemed to grow easier, and after such tremendous exertions, they felt that Endeavor deserved a holiday, and gave it a good many.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="整整一个星期这间旧屋子都洋溢着一股勤勉、谦和之风，其风之盛，足以延及邻里。这颇令人费解，因为大家似乎心情奇佳，个个都自我克制。但当她们思虑父亲的心情得到缓解之后，姑娘们便不知不觉地放松了劲儿，又开始回复到旧日的样子。她们并没有忘记自己的座右铭，只是这种期待、忙碌的日子似乎变得没有那么难熬了，经过了种种劳顿之后，她们觉得应该放个假来犒赏犒赏自己的努力，于是一放便放了许多。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">All the little duties were faithfully done each day, and many of her sisters' also, for they were forgetful, and the house seemed like a clock whose pendulum was gone a-visiting. When her heart got heavy with longings for Mother or fears for Father, she went away into a certain closet, hid her face in the folds of a dear old gown, and made her little moan and prayed her little prayer quietly by herself. Nobody knew what cheered her up after a sober fit, but everyone felt how sweet and helpful Beth was, and fell into a way of going to her for comfort or advice in their small affairs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="贝思每天都忠实地做好一切琐碎的家务。因为她的姐妹们都善忘，再兼屋子里群龙无首，她便把许多属于她们的工作也揽了过来。每当她思念父母、心情沉重的时候，她就独自走到一个衣柜边，把脸埋在旧衣服里，悄悄呜咽一阵，轻声祷告几句。没有人知道是什么使她在一阵哭泣之后重新振作起来，但大家都分明感觉到她是多么的温柔可亲、善解人意、乐于助人，于是每逢遇上哪怕是丁点儿的小问题都喜欢找她排解。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So Beth lay down on the sofa, the others returned to their work, and the Hummels were forgotten. An hour passed. Amy did not come, Meg went to her room to try on a new dress, Jo was absorbed in her story, and Hannah was sound asleep before the kitchen fire, when Beth quietly put on her hood, filled her basket with odds and ends for the poor children, and went out into the chilly air with a heavy head and a grieved look in her patient eyes. It was late when she came back, and no one saw her creep upstairs and shut herself into her mother's room. Half an hour after, Jo went to 'Mother's closet' for something, and there found little Beth sitting on the medicine chest, looking very grave, with red eyes and a camphor bottle in her hand.</div>

Mrs. Hummel told him she was poor, and had tried to cure baby herself, but now it was too late, and she could only ask him to help the others and trust to charity for his pay. He smiled then, and was kinder, but it was very sad, and I cried with them till he turned round all of a sudden, and told me to go home and take belladonna right away, or I'd have the fever."</div>

She told her story, expecting to be consoled, but Laurie only put his hands in his pockets and walked about the room, whistling softly, as he knit his brows in deep thought. Presently he sat down beside her, and said, in his most wheedlesome tone, "Now be a sensible little woman, and do as they say. No, don't cry, but hear what a jolly plan I've got.

<div class="line_en">"How is the little dear?" asked Laurie, for Beth was his especial pet, and he felt more anxious about her than he liked to show.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“小贝思情况怎么样？”劳里问。他特别宠爱贝思，因此心中万分焦急，但却不想表露出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"She is lying down on Mother's bed, and feels better. The baby's death troubled her, but I dare say she has only got cold. Hannah says she thinks so, but she looks worried, and that makes me fidgety," answered Meg.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“她现在躺在妈妈的床上，感到好些了，婴儿的死使她受了刺激，但我敢说她只是患了伤风，罕娜说她是这么认为的，但她显得神不守舍，这就让我担心死了，”梅格回答。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Meg and Jo came running down to behold the miracle which had been wrought, and Amy, feeling very precious and self-sacrificing, promised to go, if the doctor said Beth was going to be ill.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="梅格和乔跑下楼来观看这一奇迹，艾美自命不凡，觉得自己正在作出自我牺牲，答应如果医生证明贝思真的有病，她就去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What a trying world it is!" said Jo, rumpling up her hair in a fretful way. "No sooner do we get out of one trouble than down comes another. There doesn't seem to be anything to hold on to when Mother's gone, so I'm all at sea."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“真是祸不单行！”乔说道，情急之中把头发拨得纷乱，”我们一波未平，一波又起。妈妈不在，我们就像失了主心骨，我一点主意也没有了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That is what troubles me," said Meg. "I think we ought to tell her if Beth is really ill, but Hannah says we mustn't, for Mother can't leave Father, and it will only make them anxious. Beth won't be sick long, and Hannah knows just what to do, and Mother said we were to mind her, so I suppose we must, but it doesn't seem quite right to me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我正为这犯难，”梅格说，”如果贝思真的得了病，按理我们应该告诉她，但罕娜说我们不必这样做，因为妈妈不能搁下爸爸，告诉她只能让他们干着急。贝思不会病很久，罕娜知道该怎么做，再说妈妈吩咐过我们要听她的话，所以我想我们还是不要发电报，但我总觉得有点不对劲。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, don't make a porcupine of yourself, it isn't becoming. Settle your wig, Jo, and tell me if I shall telegraph to your mother, or do anything?" asked Laurie, who never had been reconciled to the loss of his friend's one beauty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“喂，别把自己弄得像头箭猪，这样并不好看。把头发弄好，乔，告诉我是发封电报给你妈妈呢，还是做点什么？”劳里问。他一直对他的朋友把一头秀发剪掉耿耿于怀。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dr. Bangs came, said Beth had symptoms of the fever, but he thought she would have it lightly, though he looked sober over the Hummel story.
