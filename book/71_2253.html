<div class="line_en">He took a few steps towards the point from which daylight was coming; the calm of reality was succeeding to the feverishness of dreams. He saw that he was in a cave, walked towards the opening and through the arched door observed blue sky and azure sea. The air and the water sparkled in the rays of the morning sun; on the shore, the sailors were chattering and laughing where they sat; and, ten yards out to sea, the boat bobbed gracefully at anchor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他向光线进来的那个地方走前几步，在梦的兴奋激动以后，跟着就来了现实的宁静，他发觉自己是在一个岩洞里，他向洞口走去，透过一座拱形的门廊，看到一片蔚蓝的海和一片淡青色的天空，空气和海水在清晨的阳光里闪闪地发亮，水手们坐在海滩上，在那儿叽哩咕噜地谈着笑着，离他们十码远的地方，静静地泊着那艘小船。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Franz regained consciousness, the outside world seemed like a continuation of his dream: he felt himself to be in a tomb where barely a single ray of sunshine, like a look of pity, could penetrate. He reached out and felt stone. He sat up and found that he was lying, wrapped in his burnous, on a bed of dry heather, soft and sweet-smelling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当弗兰士醒来的时候，外界的境物似乎是他梦的第二部分。他以为自己是躺在一个坟墓里，一缕阳光象是一道怜悯的眼光似的从外面透进来。他伸出手去，触着了石头。他坐起身来，发觉自己是和衣躺在一只非常柔软而芬香的干芰草所铺成的床上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For a short while he enjoyed the cool breeze on his forehead, listening to the muffled sound of the waves against the shore, where they left a lace pattern of silvery white foam on the rocks. He abandoned himself, without attempting to analyse it, to the divine charm of natural things, especially when one can enjoy them after a fantastic dream. Then, little by little, this outside life, with its calm, its purity and its grandeur, recalled the improbability of his dream, and memories began to flood back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他在洞口站了一会儿，享受着那拂过他额头的清新的微风，倾听着那卷到海滩上来的、在岩石四周留下一圈白色泡沫的波浪的轻微拍击声。他暂时让自己沉醉在大自然的圣洁妩媚里，把一切回想和思虑都抛在一边，当人们在一场迷乱的怪梦以后，常常总是这样的；于是，这种这样宁静，这样纯洁，这样宏伟的外界生活渐渐地向他证实了梦的虚幻，他开始回想起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He remembered arriving on the island, being introduced to the chief of the smugglers, then an underground palace full of marvels, an excellent dinner and a spoonful of hashish. But, confronted by the reality of daylight, it seemed to him that all this had happened at least a year ago, so large did his dream loom in mind and so immediate did it seem. Thus, from time to time, his imagination took one of the shadow figures who had lit up his night with their kisses, and made her sit amongst the sailors, or walk across a rock or stand in the rocking boat. In any case, his head was quite clear and his body perfectly rested. There was no heaviness in his brain but, on the contrary, a certain general feeling of well-being and an ability to absorb the air and the sun that was greater than ever.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他记得怎样到达这个岛上，怎样被介绍给一个走私贩子的首领，怎样进入一座富丽堂皇的地下宫殿，怎样用了一顿山珍海馐的晚餐，怎样咽下了一茶匙大麻精。但是，面对着白天，这种种所经过的一切似乎至少已是一年以前的事情了，那个梦在他的脑子里所留下的印象是这样的深刻，在他的想象里所占据的地位是这样的坚强。他不时地在幻想中，看到梦中垂青于他并投以香吻的女仙中的一个在水手之中；时而幻想着看到她坐在岩石上，或是坐在船里，随着船儿上下摆动。除了这一点以外，他的头脑却十分清醒，他的身体也已完全从疲劳里恢复了过来。他的头脑毫无迟钝的感觉，相反的，他却感觉到相当轻松，他从来没象现在这样活泼地呼吸纯洁的空气或欣赏明亮的阳光。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So it was with a light heart that he went down to join his sailors. As soon as they saw him, they rose and the master came across. "Milord Sinbad," he said, "requested us to convey his compliments to Your Excellency, and asked us to express his regret at not being able to bid Your Excellency farewell. He hopes that you will excuse him when you know that he has urgent business in Malaga."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他兴冲冲地向水手们走过去，他们一看见他，就马上站起来，船长招呼他说：“辛巴德先生留言向大人致意，他不能亲自向您告别，托我们转达歉意，但他相信您一定会原谅他的，因为有非常重要的大事召他到马拉加去了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"So, my dear Gaetano," Franz said, "all this is real then: there was a man who welcomed me to this island, treated me royally and left while I was asleep?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那末，盖太诺，”弗兰士说，“这一切，那末，都是真的了？这个岛上真有一个人请我去，极其殷勤地款待我，而在我睡着的时候走了的吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"So real is he that you can see his little yacht speeding off under full sail. If you want to take your spyglass, you will quite probably recognize your host himself in the midst of his crew."</div>

<div class="line_en">As he said this, Gaetano pointed towards a little boat steering a course for the southern tip of Corsica.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说着，盖太诺就向一个方向指了指，果然有一艘小帆船扬帆向科西嘉的南端驶去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Franz pulled out his own handkerchief and returned the greeting by waving it in the same manner. A moment later, a small puff of smoke appeared from the stern of the boat, detached itself from the vessel and rose in a graceful arc towards the sky, after which Franz heard the faint sound of a shot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弗兰士也同样地挥动他的手帕回答他的敬意。过了一会儿，帆船的尾部发出一蓬轻烟，象一朵瑞云似的升到空中散了开来，接着弗兰士就听到一下隐约的炮声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Franz took out his glass, adjusted the focus and turned it towards the point indicated. Gaetano was quite right. The mysterious stranger was standing on the stern of the boat, facing in his direction and, like Franz, with a spyglass in his hand. His dress was the same as the one in which he had appeared to his guest on the previous evening, and he was waving goodbye with his handkerchief.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弗兰士调整他的望远镜，向所指的那个方向望。盖太诺没有说错。在那艘船的尾部，那位神秘的陌生人也正用手握着一具望远镜，向岸边望来。他还是穿着昨天晚上的那一套衣服，挥舞着他的手帕向他的客人告别。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Gaetano reminded him that he had come here to hunt the goats, something that he had completely forgotten. He took his gun and began to scour the island like a man accomplishing a duty rather than one enjoying a pleasure; after a quarter of an hour, he had killed a goat and two kids. But, though the goats were as wild and shy as chamois, they bore too great a resemblance to the domestic variety and Franz did not consider them true game.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="盖太诺提醒他，他原是为射山羊而来的——这一点他可完全忘记了。他拿起猎枪，开始在岛上打起猎来，从神色上看，他倒象是在了却一种责任而不象在寻欢作乐；一刻钟内，他已射死一只大山羊和两只小山羊。这些动物虽然是野的，而且敏捷得象羚羊一样，但实在太象家畜的山羊了，所以弗兰士认为这简直不能算是打猎。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">However, he did not leave a single foot of the granite wall un-examined, even though it was as impenetrable as futurity. He did not notice a single crack without putting the blade of his knife into it, or a lump jutting out of the surface without pressing it, in the hope that it would give way; but all was futile and he spent two hours on this fruitless search. After that, he gave up. Gaetano was triumphant.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是，这些象“未来”一样难以渗透的花岗石壁，他却没有一呎地方不曾仔仔细细的检查过。他每看到一线裂缝，就用他那柄猎剑的剑锋插进去撬，每看到一块凸出的地方，就去撞去推，希望它会陷进去。但一切都无用，他费了两个钟头来检查，结果毫无所得。最后，他放弃了他的搜索，盖太诺胜利了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And anyway, there were far more powerful ideas on his mind. Since the previous evening he had effectively been the hero of a tale from the Thousand and One Nights, and he was irresistibly drawn back to the cave. So, even though the first investigation had failed, he began a second one, after telling Gaetano to have the two kids roasted. This second visit must have lasted a fairly long time because, when he returned, the kid was cooked and the meal was ready.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而且，还有其他更有力的念头占据着他的脑子。自从昨天傍晚以来，他已真的变成《一千〇一夜》神话里的角色之一了，他不可抗拒地又被吸引到岩洞前面。他叫盖太诺在两只小山羊里挑一只烤来吃，然后，不顾第一次的失败，他又开始作第二次搜索。这第二次的访问花了很多时间，当他回来的时候，小山羊已经烤熟，大家已在等他用餐了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Franz returned to the shore, the yacht was only a little white dot on the horizon. He tried his glass, but even with that it was impossible to make anything out.</div>

He would find plenty of friends of his own there."</div>

<div class="line_en">What was most clear in all this was that Milord Sinbad, Franz's host, had the honour to be associated with every smuggler and bandit on every coast around the Mediterranean, which could only make his position seem even more peculiar. As for Franz, there was nothing further to keep him on Monte Cristo, since he had lost all hope of finding the secret of the cavern; so he hastened to finish his lunch, while ordering the men to prepare the boat for when he was ready.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从这一篇话中就知道，弗兰士的东道主辛巴德先生显然和地中海沿岸的走私贩子和强盗都保持着极其亲善的关系，单是这一点就使他的地位够奇特的了。至于弗兰士，他已丝毫不再想在基督山逗留了。他对于侦察岩洞的秘密已感到毫无希望，所以匆匆地用完午餐，船本已准备好了的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At length he managed to make his way through the swelling and increasingly expectant crowd, and reached the hotel. At his first request, he was told, with that impertinence which is peculiar to cab-drivers when they have already been booked and innkeepers whose establishments are full, that there was no more room for him in the Hôtel de Londres, whereupon he sent his card up to Signor Pastrini and asked to be announced to Albert de Morcerf. This tactic succeeded and Signor Pastrini hurried down in person, begging pardon for having kept His Excellency waiting, scolding his staff, snatching the candlestick from the hand of the guide who had already taken charge of the traveller, and preparing to conduct him to Albert, when the latter himself came to meet them.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Damnation!" said Albert. "All this means is that we shall pay dearer for it. You know how it goes: from Drake or Aaron -- twenty-five francs on ordinary days, and thirty or thirty-five on Sundays and holidays. Add five francs a day as your own fee, and we are in for a round forty francs."</div>
