<div class="line_en">"Not yet, Daughter of Eve," he said. "Not yet. But you are growing more like it. It is not certain that some wicked one of your race will not find out a secret as evil as the Deplorable Word and use it to destroy all living things. And soon, very soon, before you are an old man and an old woman, great nations in your world will be ruled by tyrants who care no more for joy and justice and mercy than the Empress Jadis. Let your world beware. That is the warning. Now for the command. As soon as you can, take from this Uncle of yours his magic rings and bury them so that no one can use them again."</div>

<div class="line_en">They were on the pavement outside the Ketterleys' front door, and except that the Witch, the Horse, and the Cabby were gone, everything was exactly as they had left it. There was the lamp-post, with one arm missing; there was the wreck of the hansom cab; and there was the crowd. Everyone was still talking and people were kneeling beside the damaged policeman, saying things like, "He's coming round" or "How do you feel now, old chap?" or "The Ambulance will be here in a jiffy."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们走在凯特利家前门外的人行道上，除了女巫、马和马车夫消失了以外，一切依然如旧。灯柱还在，缺了一根横杆。马车的残骸和人群都在。大伙儿都在议论，有人跪在被打伤的警察身边，说着“他醒过来了”、“你现在觉得怎么样，老弟？”或者“救护车马上就到”之类的话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Both the children were looking up into the Lion's face as he spoke these words. And all at once (they never knew exactly how it happened) the face seemed to be a sea of tossing gold in which they were floating, and such a sweetness and power rolled about them and over them and entered them that they felt they had never really been happy or wise or good, or even alive and awake, before. And the memory of that moment stayed with them always, so that as long as they both lived, if ever they were sad or afraid or angry, the thought of all that golden goodness, and the feeling that it was still there, quite close, just round some corner or just behind some door, would come back and make them sure, deep down inside, that all was well. Next minute all three of them (Uncle Andrew now awake) came tumbling into the noise, heat, and hot smells of London.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当狮子说这番话时，两个孩子都拾起头，凝视着它。顷刻间（他们一点儿也不知道是怎么发生的），那张脸变成了一片起伏不定的金色海洋，他们漂浮在海中，一种力和甜蜜的感觉缠绕着他们，淹没了他们并渗透到他们体内，使他们意识到，自己以前从来没有过真正的幸福、智慧和美好，甚至没有活过、醒过。那一瞬间的记忆一直伴随着他们，在他们的有生之年，只要心中感到悲哀、害怕或者愤怒，就会想起那一刻金色的良辰，那种感觉依然存在，很近，就在某个拐弯处或者某一扇门后，就会重新回来，使他们由衷地相信，生活是美好的。不一会儿，三个人（安德鲁舅舅也醒了）就跌跌撞撞地回到了伦敦的喧嚣、炎热和刺鼻气味中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Most people were wildly looking round for Jadis and the horse. No one took any notice of the children for no one had seen them go or noticed them coming back. As for Uncle Andrew, what between the state of his clothes and the honey on his face, he could not have been recognized by anyone. Fortunately the front door of the house was-open and the housemaid was standing in the doorway staring at the fun (what a day that girl was having!) so the children had no difficulty in bustling Uncle Andrew indoors before anyone asked any questions.</div>

<div class="line_en">He raced up the stirs before them and at first they were very afraid he was heading for his attic and meant to hide his remaining magic rings. But they needn't have bothered.

<div class="line_en">And just as the Witch Jadis had looked different when you saw her in our world instead of in her own, so the fruit of that mountain garden looked different too. There were of course all sorts of coloured things in the bedroom; the coloured counterpane on the bed, the wallpaper, the sunlight from the window, and Mother's pretty, pale blue dressing jacket. But the moment Digory took the Apple out of his pocket, all those things seemed to have scarcely any colour at all. Every one of them, even the sunlight, looked faded and dingy. The brightness of the Apple threw strange lights on the ceiling. Nothing else was worth looking at: you couldn't look at anything else. And the smell of the Apple of Youth was as if there was a window in the room that opened on Heaven.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就像你在我们世界里看见的简蒂丝同在她的世界里看见的不一样，山上花园里的果实看上去也有了变化。卧室里自然有不少各种色彩的东西：床罩、墙纸、从窗口射进的阳光，以及妈妈那件漂亮的淡蓝色短上衣。但迪格雷从口袋里一拿出苹果，所有的东西甚至阳光都黯然失色。明亮的苹果在天花板上投下奇异的光彩，别的东西都不值一看了——你实在也无法再看任何别的东西。那只青春之果的香味使你觉得房间里似乎有一扇朝着天堂开启的窗户“">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then Digory took a minute to get his breath, and then went softly into his Mother's room. And there she lay, as he had seen her lie so many other times, propped up on the pillows, with a thin, pale face that would make you cry to look at. Digory took the Apple of Life out of his pocket.</div>

<div class="line_en">He peeled it and cut it up and gave it to her piece by piece. And no sooner had she finished it than she smiled and her head sank back on the pillow and she was asleep: a real, natural, gentle sleep, without any of those nasty drugs, which was, as Digory knew, the thing in the whole world that she wanted most. And he was sure now that her face looked a little different. He bent down and kissed her very softly and stole out of the room with a beating heart; taking the core of the apple with him. For the rest of that day, whenever he looked at the things about him, and saw how ordinary and unmagical they were, he hardly dared to hope; but when he remembered the face of Aslan he did hope.</div>

<div class="line_en">About a week after this it was quite certain that Digory's Mother was getting better. About a fortnight later she was able to sit out in the garden. And a month later that whole house had become a different place. Aunt Letty did everything that Mother liked; windows were opened, frowsy curtains were drawn back to brighten up the rooms, there were new flowers everywhere, and nicer things to eat, and the old piano was tuned and Mother took up her singing again, and had such games with Digory and Polly that Aunt Letty would say "I declare, Mabel, you're the biggest baby of the three."</div>

<div class="line_en">When things go wrong, you'll find they usually go on getting worse for some time; but when things once start going right they often go on getting better and better. After about six weeks of this lovely life there came a long letter from Father in India, which had wonderful news in it. Old Great-Uncle Kirke had died and this meant, apparently, that Father was now very rich. He was going to retire and come home from India forever and ever. And the great big house in the country, which Digory had heard of all his life and never seen would now be their home; the big house with the suits of armour, the stables, the kennels, the river, the park, the hot-houses, the vineries, the woods, and the mountains behind it. So that Digory felt just as sure as you that they were all going to live happily ever after. But perhaps you would like to know just one or two things more.</div>

<div class="line_en">In Narnia the Beasts lived in great peace and joy and neither the Witch nor any other enemy came to trouble that pleasant land for many hundred years. King Frank and Queen Helen and their children lived happily in Narnia and their second son became King of Archenland. The boys married nymphs and the girls married woodgods and river-gods. The lamp-post which the Witch had planted (without knowing it) shone day and night in the Narnian forest, so that the place where it grew came to be called Lantern Waste; and when, many years later, another child from our world got into Narnia, on a snowy night, she found the light still burning. And that adventure was, in a way, connected with the ones I have just been telling you.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在纳尼亚，动物们非常快乐地生活在和平之中，几百年里，女巫和其他任何敌人都没来骚扰那片乐土。弗兰克国王与海伦王后以及他们的孩子也非常幸福地生活在纳尼亚。他们的第二个儿子当了阿钦兰的国王。儿子们娶了仙女，女儿们嫁了河神与树神。女巫栽下（她自己并不知道）的路灯柱日夜照耀在纳尼亚的森林里，它长大的那片地方被叫作灯柱野林。几百年后，另一个孩子在一个下雪的夜晚，从我们的世界走进纳尼亚，发现那盏灯依然亮着。那次历险在某种意义上与我刚刚告诉你们的故事紧密相联。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was like this. The tree which sprang from the Apple that Digory planted in the back garden, lived and grew into a fine tree. Growing in the soil of our world, far out of the sound of Aslan's voice and far from the young air of Narnia, it did not bear apples that would revive a dying woman as Digory's Mother had been revived, though it did bear apples more beautiful than any others in England, and they were extremely good for you, though not fully magical. But inside itself, in the very sap of it, the tree (so to speak) never forgot that other tree in Narnia to which it belonged. Sometimes it would move mysteriously when there was no wind blowing: I think that when this happened there were high winds in Narnia and the English tree quivered because, at that moment, the Narnia tree was rocking and swaying in a strong south-western gale. However, that might be, it was proved later that there was still magic in its wood. For when Digory was quite middle-aged (and he was a famous learned man, a Professor, and a great traveller by that time) and the Ketterleys' old house belonged to him, there was a great storm all over the south of England which blew the tree down. He couldn't bear to have it simply chopped up for firewood, so he had part of the timber made into a wardrobe, which he put in his big house in the country. And though he himself did not discover the magic properties of that wardrobe, someone else did. That was the beginning of all the comings and goings between Narnia and our world, which you can read of in other books.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="事情是这样的。迪格雷埋在后花园里的苹果核长成了一棵美丽的树。因为长在我们这个世界的土壤里，远离阿斯兰的声音和纳尼亚年轻的空气，虽然它的果实比英格兰其他所有苹果都要漂亮得多，而且对你极有益处，但却没有十足的魔力，也不会再像救活迪格雷的妈妈一样使一个垂死的妇女恢复生机。但是，就这棵果树的内在性质而言，在它的汁液之中，这棵树（就这样称它吧）仍然没有忘记它所属的在纳尼亚的那棵树。有时没有刮风，它也会神秘地摇动。我想，这种时候纳尼亚一定在刮大风；在英格兰的这棵树之所以战栗，是因为纳尼亚的母树在强劲的西南风中摇摆晃动。然而，以后证明了，这棵树的木材中仍然存在着魔法。当迪格雷到了中年（那时，他成了著名的学者、教授和大旅行家，凯特利家的老房子也归他所有），英格兰南部的一场风暴吹倒了那棵树。他不忍心让人把它当柴烧了，便用一部分木料做了一个大衣柜，放在他乡下的大房子里。他自己虽然没有发现那衣柜的魔力，另一个人却发现了。那就是我们的世界和纳尼亚之间所有故事的开端，你可以在这本书的其他故事里读到。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When Digory and his people went to live in the big country house, they took Uncle Andrew to live with them; for Digory's Father said, "We must try to keep the old fellow out of mischief, and it isn't fair that poor Letty should have him always on her hands." Uncle Andrew never tried any Magic again as long as he lived. He had learned his lesson, and in his old age he became a nicer and less selfish old man than he had ever been before. But he always liked to get visitors alone in the billiard-room and tell them stories about a mysterious lady, a foreign royalty, with whom he had driven about London. "A devilish temper she had," he would say. "But she was a dem fine woman, sir, a dem fine woman."</div>
