<div class="line_en">"You must not think it necessary for you to come to the chapel when we do," she said. "You are a Protestant and you have your own convictions."</div>

<div class="line_en">Since the nuns were busy from morning till night with a hundred duties Kitty saw little of them but at the services in the bare, humble chapel. On her first day the Mother Superior, catching sight of her seated at the back behind the girls on the benches according to their ages, stopped and spoke to her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="修女们一天到晚里外忙活，除了在简陋的礼拜堂里做礼拜的时候，凯蒂很少看见她们。来帮忙的第一天，凯蒂来到礼拜堂，坐到后排的长凳上，前面是几排按照年龄大小的顺序就座的女孩儿。修道院长看到了她，便走过来和她说话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Mother Superior gave her a moment's glance and slightly inclined her grave head.</div>

<div class="line_en">But with Sister St Joseph Kitty soon became on terms not of intimacy perhaps but of familiarity. The economy of the convent was in her charge and to look after the material well-being of that big family kept the Sister on her feet all day. She said that the only time she had to rest was that which she devoted to prayer. But it pleased her towards evening when Kitty was with the girls at their work to come in and, vowing that she was tired out and had not a moment to spare, sit down for a few minutes and gossip. When she was not in the presence of the Mother Superior she was a talkative, merry creature, fond of a joke, and she did not dislike a bit of scandal. Kitty stood in no fear of her, her habit did not prevent Sister St Joseph from being a good-natured, homely woman, and she chattered with her gaily. She did not mind with her showing how badly she talked French and they laughed with one another over Kitty's mistakes. The Sister taught her every day a few useful words of Chinese. She was a farmer's daughter and at heart she was still a peasant.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没过多久，凯蒂就在礼拜堂里和圣约瑟姐妹混在了一起，两人的关系即使不是亲密，也是相当熟稔了。这位姐妹掌控修道院的经济财政大权，为了这一大家子的福利问题，从早到晚腿都要跑断了。她说一天之中唯一放松的时刻，就是在礼拜堂里念祈祷词了。每到傍晚凯蒂带着她那些手上还拿着活儿的徒弟走进来的时候，圣约瑟姐妹都会欣喜万分，忙不迭地对凯蒂声称她已经累得动弹不得，赶紧坐下来东拉西扯一会儿。修道院长若不在场，她就是一个欢天喜地、滔滔不绝的姑娘，不但笑话一个接一个地讲，还对各色丑闻韵事评头论足。凯蒂对她没有丝毫的忌惮，圣约瑟姐妹自然也敞开心扉，在凯蒂面前俨然是一位外表朴实、心地善良的女子。凯蒂兴高采烈地与之闲聊，对自己拙劣的法语不加掩饰，两人还常常因为凯蒂的某个语病而笑作一团。凯蒂每天都从圣约瑟姐妹那里学来几句实用的汉语。圣约瑟姐妹是农夫的女儿，而至今在心底里还是个农民。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh, no. It would be too hard to come back. I love to be here and I am never so happy as when I am among the orphans. They're so good, they're so grateful. But it is all very well to be a nun (on a beau etre religieuse), still one has a mother and one cannot forget that one drank the milk of her breasts. She is old, my mother, and it is hard never to see her again; but then she is fond of her daughter-in-law, and my brother is good to her. His son is growing up how, I should think they will be glad of an extra pair of strong arms on the farm; he was only a child when I left France, but he promised to have a fist that you could fell an ox with."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“呃，没有过。要想回去太难了。我喜欢这里，尤其是跟那些孤儿在一块儿的时候，从来没有那么高兴过。她们心好，对你心怀感激。一个修女（即便是位修女）要是有一个妈妈，她还老惦记着小时候喝过她的奶水，这也挺好的。我的妈妈很老了，真想再见她一眼。不过她的儿媳妇讨她欢喜，我哥哥对她也很孝顺。他的儿子快长大了，我看不久他们就会看到农场里又添了一个壮劳力。我从法国走的时候他还是个孩子，但那时候他的手一看就知道将来是拿斧头的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I used to keep the cows when I was little," she said, "like St Joan of Arc. But I was too wicked to have visions. It was fortunate, I think, for my father would certainly have whipped me if I had. He used often to whip me, the good old man, for I was a very naughty little girl. I am ashamed sometimes when I think now of the pranks I used to play."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我很小的时候就会放牛了。”她说道，“就跟圣女贞德一样。但是我心眼太坏，肯定成不了贞德。这够幸运的，我想，因为要是我敢胡思乱想，我的父亲就会拿鞭子抽我。那个好老头儿，他过去没少抽我，因为我小时候特别淘气。现在想起那时候搞的恶作剧，我还忍不住脸红呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Do you never wish to go home again, ma soeur? asked Kitty.</div>

<div class="line_en">Kitty laughed at the thought that this corpulent, middle-aged nun could ever have been a wayward child. And yet there was something childlike in her still so that your heart went out to her: she seemed to have about her an aroma of the countryside in autumn when the apple trees are laden with fruit and the crops are in and safely housed. She had not the tragic and austere saintliness of the Mother Superior, but a gaiety that was simple and happy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这位身材圆胖的中年修女也曾是个任性的娃娃，想到这个凯蒂就觉得好笑。不过，即使是现在，她的身上也还流露着一股孩子气，让人不由自主地想和她亲近。她的身上似乎散发着秋日乡村所特有的馨香，那时苹果树被丰满的果实压弯了枝头，庄稼已经收割完毕、去壳入仓了。修道院长具有圣人般的悲怆、苛刻，而她仅仅是单纯地快乐着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was almost impossible in that quiet room, listening to the nun, to realize that on the other side of these four walls cholera was raging. Sister St Joseph had an unconcern which conveyed itself to Kitty.</div>

<div class="line_en">She had a naive curiosity about the world and its inhabitants. She asked Kitty all kinds of questions about London and England, a country, she thought, where so thick was the fog that you could not see your hand at mid-day, and she wanted to know if Kitty went to balls and whether she lived in a grand house and how many brothers and sisters she had. She spoke often of Walter. The Mother Superior said he was wonderful and every day they prayed for him. How lucky Kitty was to have a husband who was so good and so brave and so clever.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="圣约瑟姐妹对世上的各个国度及其居民充满了好奇。她向凯蒂问了无数关于伦敦和英格兰的问题。按她以前的想法，英格兰到处浓雾弥漫，到了正午也是伸手不见五指。她还问凯蒂是不是舞会上的常客，是否住在一所豪华的大房子里，以及有多少个兄弟姐妹等等。她常常说起瓦尔特，修道院长就说他是个出色的人，她们每天都给他祈祷。凯蒂嫁了这样一个善良、勇敢、聪明的好丈夫，是多么有福气啊。">查看中文翻译</div>
