<div class="line_en">"They're not ours," said Peter doubtfully.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这怎么行，衣服不是我们的。”彼得犹豫不决地说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Ugh!" said Susan, stamping her feet, "it's pretty cold. What about putting on some of these coats?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，”苏姗跺着脚说，“多冷呀，拿几件外套先穿上，你们说好吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I am sure nobody would mind," said Susan; "it isn't as if we wanted to take them out of the house; we shan't take them even out of the wardrobe."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我相信谁也不会有什么意见，”苏珊说，“我们又不想把它们带到屋外去，我们甚至不会把它们带出衣橱。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I never thought of that, Su," said Peter. "Of course, now you put it that way, I see. No one could say you had bagged a coat as long as you leave it in the wardrobe where you found it. And I suppose this whole country is in the wardrobe."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我倒没考虑到这一点，苏，”彼得说，“经你这么一说，我看当然可以。只要你们在橱里什么地方拿的，还放在什么地方，就不会有谁说你们是小偷了。据我猜测，这整个国家就在衣橱里边。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They immediately carried out Susan's very sensible plan. The coats were rather too big for them so that they came down to their heels and looked more like royal robes than coats when they had put them on. But they all felt a good deal warmer and each thought the others looked better in their new get-up and more suitable to the landscape.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，他们就立即执行了苏珊的这个合情合理的计划。衣服太大，他们套在身上，一直拖到脚后跟，就像是穿了龙袍似的。但他们都感到暖和多了，相互一打量，也都觉得这样打扮显得更好看了，与冰天雪地的风光也更相配了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"This is going to be exciting enough without pretending," said Peter, as he began leading the way forward into the forest. There were heavy darkish clouds overhead and it looked as if there might be more snow before night.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“就这样，不用什么打扮，也够威风的了。”彼得一边说，一边领着大家朝森林前进。头上乌云密布，似乎在傍晚前还要下一场大雪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I say," began Edmund presently, "oughtn't we to be bearing a bit more to the left, that is, if we are aiming for the lamp-post?" He had forgotten for the moment that he must pretend never to have been in the wood before. The moment the words were out of his mouth he realized that he had given himself away.

<div class="line_en">There was a dead silence. "Well, of all the poisonous little beasts --" said Peter, and shrugged his shoulders and said no more. There seemed, indeed, no more to say, and presently the four resumed their journey; but Edmund was saying to himself, "I'll pay you all out for this, you pack of stuck-up, selfsatisfied prigs."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着是死一般的沉寂。“唉，各种各样难对付的人都有……”彼得说着，耸了耸肩膀，就没有往下再说什么。看来，也确实没有更多的话可说了，过了一会儿，四个人又重新开始他们的旅程。只有爱德蒙心里暗暗在想：我总有一天要惩罚你们一下，你们这一伙自命不凡的伪君子。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Everyone agreed to this and off they went walking briskly and stamping their feet. Lucy proved a good leader. At first she wondered whether she would be able to find the way, but she recognized an oddlooking tree on one place and a stump in another and brought them on to where the ground became uneven and into the little valley and at last to the very door of Mr Tumnus's cave. But there a terrible surprise awaited them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大家一致同意这个建议，于是就立即出发。他们一边轻快地跑着，一边跺着脚。事实证明，露茜是个好向导。起初，她担心自己找不到路，但她在一个地方认出了一棵长得古里古怪的树，后来又认出了一个树桩，终于把大家带到了一个崎岖不平的地方，然后进了那个小山谷，没多久就到了图姆纳斯先生的洞口，但他们所看到的却是一幅十分可怕的景象，他们都大吃一惊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Where are we going anyway?" said Susan, chiefly for the sake of changing the subject.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们到底往哪里走啊？”苏珊问道，她这样说，主要是为了岔开刚才的话题。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I think Lu ought to be the leader," said Peter; "goodness knows she deserves it. Where will you take us, Lu?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我看，应当让露茜做向导，”彼得说，“也只有她配做向导。璐，你打算带我们上哪儿去？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The door had been wrenched off its hinges and broken to bits. Inside, the cave was dark and cold and had the damp feel and smell of a place that had not been lived in for several days. Snow had drifted in from the doorway and was heaped on the floor, mixed with something black, which turned out to be the charred sticks and ashes from the fire. Someone had apparently flung it about the room and then stamped it out. The crockery lay smashed on the floor and the picture of the Faun's father had been slashed into shreds with a knife.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="门已被扭脱了下来，断成了好几截，洞内又黑又冷，又潮湿，满是霉味。看来，这个地方已有好些日子没有人住了。雪从洞口吹进来，堆积在门口，里面还混杂着一些黑糊糊的东西，再一看，是烧剩下来的木炭屑和炭灰。很明显，是有人把烧着的柴火扔到了洞内，然后又把它们踩灭了。陶罐打碎在地上，羊怪父亲的画像被人用刀子砍成了碎片。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What about going to see Mr Tumnus?" said Lucy. "He's the nice Faun I told you about."</div>

<div class="line_en">They were all still wondering what to do next, when Lucy said, "Look! There's a robin, with such a red breast. It's the first bird I've seen here. I say! -- I wonder can birds talk in Narnia? It almost looks as if it wanted to say something to us." Then she turned to the Robin and said, "Please, can you tell us where Tumnus the Faun has been taken to?" As she said this she took a step towards the bird. It at once flew away but only as far as to the next tree. There it perched and looked at them very hard as if it understood all they had been saying. Almost without noticing that they had done so, the four children went a step or two nearer to it. At this the Robin flew away again to the next tree and once more looked at them very hard. (You couldn't have found a robin with a redder chest or a brighter eye.)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大家默不作声，考虑着下一步该怎么办。突然，露茜对大家说：“你们看，那里有一只知更鸟，它的胸脯是多么的红啊。它是我在这儿看到的第一只鸟。哎呀，难道那尼亚的鸟儿会讲话吗？它看来好像有什么话要对我们说似的。”说着，她就转过身对知更鸟说：“请问，你知道图姆纳斯先生被押送到什么地方去了吗？”她说着，又朝着鸟儿走近了一步。那知更鸟立即就跳着飞走了，不过它就落在紧紧相邻的一棵树上。它停在那儿，紧紧地盯着他们，好像它完全懂得他们说的话似的。四个孩子几乎把什么都忘了，一起向它靠近了一两步。看到他们走近了，那鸟儿又飞到了另外一棵树上，仍然紧盯着他们。（你肯定没看到过胸脯比它还要红、眼睛比它还要亮的知更鸟）">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Robin appeared to understand the matter thoroughly. It kept going from tree to tree, always a few yards ahead of them, but always so near that they could easily follow it. In this way it led them on, slightly downhill. Wherever the Robin alighted a little shower of snow would fall off the branch. Presently the clouds parted overhead and the winter sun came out and the snow all around them grew dazzlingly bright. They had been travelling in this way for about half an hour, with the two girls in front, when Edmund said to Peter, "if you're not still too high and mighty to talk to me, I've something to say which you'd better listen to."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那知更鸟好像完全懂事似的，它不断地从一棵树飞到另一棵树，总是飞落在他们前面仅仅几码远的地方，使他们很容易跟上它。它就这样引着他们慢慢地走下山坡。它每停一处，那儿的树枝上就掉下一阵雪来。没过多久，头上的乌云散开了，太阳出来了，茫茫雪原变得更加耀眼晶莹。他们就这样一直走了大约半个小时，两个女孩子一直走在前面。这时，爱德蒙对彼得说：“如果你们不再这样高傲自大、目中无人，我有话要对你们说，你们最好听听。”">查看中文翻译</div>
