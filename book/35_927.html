<div class="line_en">Wistan, then, could not be so badly hurt. Indeed, he must have managed this same journey down the hill not long ago, and while it was still dark. Had he had to lean heavily on the arm of his guide? Or had he managed to go mounted on his mare, perhaps with a monk holding steady the bridle?</div>

<div class="line_en">The young monk was a thin, sickly-looking Pict who spoke Edwin's language well. No doubt he had been delighted to have in his company someone nearer his own age, and for the first part of the journey down through the dawn mists, he had talked with relish. But since entering the trees, the young monk had fallen silent and Edwin now wondered if he had in some way offended his guide. More likely the monk was simply anxious not to attract the attention of whatever lurked in these woods; amidst the pleasant birdsong, there had been some strange hissings and murmurs. When Edwin had asked once again, more from a wish to break the silence than for reassurance, "So my brother's wounds seemed not to be mortal?" the reply had been almost curt.</div>

<div class="line_en">At least he had done his utmost once he had emerged into the chilly morning air. He had run almost the whole way back up to the monastery, slowing only for the steepest slopes. Sometimes, pushing through the woods, he had felt himself lost, but then the trees had thinned and the monastery had appeared against the pale sky. So he had gone on climbing and arrived at the big gate, breathless and with his legs aching.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="至少，他走入清晨的寒冷空气之后，是尽了力的。他几乎是一路跑回到了山上的修道院，遇到最陡的坡才会慢下来。有时候，他要穿过密林，感觉走错了路，但随后树木变稀，修道院又出现在灰色的天空之下。于是他接着往上爬，到大门的时候，双腿酸痛、气喘吁吁。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Show this boy down to the cooper's cottage. And take care no one sees you leave the monastery." Such, according to the young monk, had been Father Jonus's instruction to him. So Edwin would soon be reunited with the warrior, but what sort of welcome could he expect? He had let Wistan down at the first challenge. Instead of hurrying to his side at the first sign of battle, Edwin had run off into the long tunnel. But his mother had not been down there, and only when the tunnel's end had finally appeared, distant and moon-like in the blackness, had he felt lifting from him the heavy clouds of dream and realised with horror what had occurred.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“把男孩领到山下箍桶匠的屋里。不要让人看见你离开修道院。”根据年轻僧侣的说法，乔纳斯神父是这么吩咐的。看来埃德温很快就能和武士团聚，但他能期待什么样的欢迎呢？第一次遇到挑战，他就让维斯坦失望了。埃德温没能在战斗一开始时就赶到他身旁，而是跑进了那条长长的隧道。但他母亲不在那下面，最后隧道的出口终于出现，在遥远的前方，黑暗中如同月亮，这时候梦的阴云才从他心头散去，他回过神来，想起发生的事，感到非常震惊。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For some time he came across neither monk nor soldier. But as he moved along the high wall, ducking his head so as not to be spotted from some far-off window, he had seen below the soldiers' horses crowded together in the small yard inside the main gate. Bound on all sides by high walls, the animals, still saddled, were circling nervously, even though there was scarcely space to do so without colliding. Then as he came towards the monks' quarters, where another of his age might well have rushed on to the central courtyard, he had had the presence of mind to recall the geography of the grounds and proceed by a roundabout route, utilising what he remembered of the back ways. Even on reaching his destination, he had placed himself behind a stone pillar and peered round cautiously.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一开始，他没有碰到僧侣，也没遇上士兵。他沿着高墙走，脑袋低着，以免被远处某扇窗户里的人看到，这时他看到下面大门内的小院子里，挤满了士兵们的马。马鞍没下，四周都是高墙，所以马儿都在焦虑地转圈，地方很小，有时候会互相撞上。他继续朝僧侣的住处走去，换作别的孩子，肯定就直接跑到中央的院子里去了，他却心思周密，想了一下修道院的布局之后，他走了一条绕弯子的路，利用了他记忆中的那些隐秘路径。就是快到目的地的时候，他还是要躲在一根石柱后面，先小心翼翼地看看周围。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The small door beside the main gate was unlocked, and he had managed to collect himself sufficiently to enter the grounds with stealthy care. He had been aware of smoke for the latter part of his climb, but now it tickled his chest, making it hard not to cough loudly. He knew then for sure it was too late to move the hay wagon, and felt a great emptiness opening within him. But he had pushed the feeling aside for another moment, and pressed on into the grounds.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大门旁的那扇小门没锁，他打起精神，偷偷摸摸溜了进去。山路走了一半的时候，他就意识到了烟味儿，这时候烟熏得他胸口疼，忍不住要大声咳嗽。他知道，这时候去移干草车，肯定太迟了，顿时感到心里空荡荡的，没有着落。但他还是把这种感觉放到了一边，继续朝里面走。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The central courtyard was barely recognisable. Three robed figures were sweeping wearily, and as he watched, a fourth arrived with a pail and tossed water across the cobbles, setting to flight several lurking crows. The ground was strewn in places with straw and with sand, and his eyes were drawn to the several shapes covered over with sackcloth, which he supposed to be corpses. The old stone tower, where he knew Wistan had held out, loomed over the scene, but this too had changed: it was charred and blackened in many places, especially around its arched entryway and each of its narrow windows. To Edwin's eyes the tower as a whole appeared to have shrunk. He had been craning his neck around the pillar to ascertain if the pools surrounding the covered shapes were of blood or of water, when the bony hands had grasped his shoulders from behind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="中央的院子简直认不出来了。三个人穿着僧袍，懒洋洋地扫着地，在他看的时候，又来了一个人，拿着桶往鹅卵石上泼水，躲在一旁的几只乌鸦受了惊吓，飞走了。地面上零零散散撒了干草和沙，他注意到有几个人形的东西，用麻布盖着，他猜可能是尸体。他知道维斯坦曾在那儿负隅抗敌的古老石塔，这时依然巍巍耸立，但连塔也发生了变化：塔身很多地方成了焦黑色，尤其是入门的拱廊和每一扇窄窗的周围。在埃德温看来，整个石塔似乎一下子缩小了。他从柱子后面伸长脖子，想确定一下，麻布覆盖的人形周围那一摊摊潮湿的地方，究竟是血还是水，这时一双瘦骨嶙峋的手从背后抓住了他的肩膀。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He had twisted around to find Father Ninian, the silent monk, staring into his eyes. Edwin had not cried out, but had said, in a low voice, pointing towards the bodies: "Master Wistan, my Saxon brother. Does he lie there?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他扭过身子，发现尼尼安神父——那个不说话的僧侣——正盯着自己的眼睛。埃德温没有喊叫，而是指着尸体，低声说道：“维斯坦阁下，我的撒克逊兄弟。他也躺在那儿？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The silent monk appeared to understand, and shook his head emphatically. But even as he raised a finger to his lips in the familiar manner, he had stared warningly into Edwin's face. Then, glancing furtively around him, Ninian had tugged Edwin away from the courtyard.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="沉默的僧侣似乎能听懂他的话，用力摇了摇头。他抬起一根手指，放在嘴唇上，但就在做这个熟悉的动作时，他仍在瞪着埃德温的脸，似乎是要警告对方。然后，尼尼安偷眼望了望四周，把埃德温拉走了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He and Wistan had been in the barn behind the old tower. Having for the moment done with woodcutting, the warrior had been seized by the urge to load the rickety wagon high with the hay stored at the back of the shed. As they had set about this task, Edwin had been required at regular intervals to clamber up onto the bales and prod into them with a stick. The warrior, observing carefully from the ground, would sometimes make him go over a section again, or order him to thrust a leg as far down as possible into a particular spot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当时，他和维斯坦在古老石塔后面的谷仓里。武士这下子不去劈柴了，却又急不可耐地要把马棚后面储藏的干草搬过来，堆到那辆摇摇晃晃的推车上。他们动手干这件事的时候，他又不时让埃德温爬上草垛，用棒子往里捅。武士站在地上认真看着，有时候会让他到某个地方重新捅一遍，或者命令他把腿伸进某个具体的位置，越深越好。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Had his real mother called him in his dreams? Perhaps that was why he had remained asleep for so long.

<div class="line_cn" title="他真正的母亲在梦里喊他了吗？也许是这个原因，他才睡了那么久，被跛脚的僧侣叫醒之后，他没有冲到武士身旁，而是跟在其他人后面，进了那条奇怪的长隧道，好像他仍旧在梦境深处一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It had been his mother's voice without doubt, the same voice that had called to him in the barn. "Find the strength for me, Edwin. Find the strength and come rescue me. Come rescue me. Come rescue me." There had been an urgency there he had not heard the previous morning. And there had been more: as he had stood at that open trap-door, staring down at the steps leading into the darkness, he had felt something pull at him with such force he had become giddy, almost sick.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那毫无疑问是他母亲的声音，同一个声音在谷仓里也曾向他呼喊。“埃德温，为了我，找到力量吧。找到力量，来救我。来救我。来救我。”与头天早晨相比，这时的声音里有一种急迫感。还有别的：站在打开的暗门前、盯着通向黑暗的台阶时，他曾感到有东西在拉他，力气很大，让他头晕目眩，几乎要呕吐。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But Edwin had let him down. How could he have gone on sleeping for so long? It had been a mistake to lie down at all. He should simply have sat upright in the corner, napping a few winks the way he had seen Wistan do, ready at the first noise to start to his feet. Instead, like an infant, he had accepted from the old woman a cup of milk, and fallen into a deep sleep in his corner of the chamber.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可埃德温却让他失望了。他怎么会睡了那么久呢？躺下来本身就是个错误。他就该直挺挺地坐在角落里，偶尔闭闭眼睛，像维斯坦那样，一听到声音立即就能站起身来。可他呢，像个婴儿一样，喝了老太太递来的一杯牛奶，就在房间那一头沉睡不醒。">查看中文翻译</div>

An animal in a trap? There it was again, behind the birdsong and the wind. The noise followed a pattern: an intense burst of rustling, as of a struggle, then silence. Then soon, more rustling.

The flattened grass around her marked the area where, by pushing with her legs, she had been sliding about in her struggles.

<div class="line_en">Edwin hurried forward, like a thief spying an opportunity, and crouching in the grass began to tug at the knots. The twine was thin and coarse, cutting cruelly into her wrists; the palms, in contrast, spread open one across the other, were small and tender. At first the knots did not yield, but he forced himself to be calm and studied carefully the path the coils took. Then when he tried again, the knot gave under his touch.

But now, when he considered it all carefully, he was certain he had felt no fear.

<div class="line_en">Glancing down, Edwin had seen in front of him a kind of moat which followed the circular wall all the way to form a ring. It was too wide for a man to leap, and the simple bridge of two planks was the only way to reach the central floor of trodden earth. As he stepped onto the planks, gazing down into the darkness below, he heard the warrior say behind him:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="埃德温低下头，看到眼前似乎有条壕沟，围着圆形的石墙形成一个圆圈。沟太宽了，跳不过去，两块木板搭成一个简单的桥，只有从桥上走，才能到达塔中央的夯土地面。他迈步走上木板，眼睛望着黑漆漆的桥下，武士在他身后说：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Wistan had been preoccupied with the old tower from the time they had first arrived at the monastery. Edwin could remember him continually glancing up at it while they had been cutting logs in the woodshed. And when they had pushed the barrow around the grounds to deliver the firewood, they had twice made diversions just to go past it. So it had come as no surprise, once the monks had disappeared into their meeting and the courtyard was empty, that the warrior should lean the axe on the woodpile and say: "Come a moment, young comrade, and we'll examine more closely this tall and ancient friend who stares down at us. It seems to me he watches where we go, and takes offence we've yet to pay him a visit."</div>

Why a moat on the inside? Why a moat at all for a small tower like this? What good can it do?" Wistan came over the planks himself and tested with his heel the central floor. "Perhaps," he went on, "the ancients built this tower to slaughter animals. Perhaps once this was their killing floor.

Imagine the animal twisting, trying to charge, yet finding the moat wherever it turned. And the one small bridge so hard to locate in a frenzy.

"This place, not just this old tower, but this entire place, all of what men today call this monastery, I'd wager was once a hillfort built by our Saxon forefathers in times of war. So it contains many cunning traps to welcome invading Britons." The warrior moved away and slowly paced the perimeter of the floor, staring down into the moat. Eventually he looked up again and said: "Imagine this place a fort, boy. The siege broken after many days, the enemy pouring in. Fighting in every yard, on every wall. Now picture this. Two of our Saxon cousins, out there in the yard, hold back a large body of Britons. They fight bravely, but the enemy's too great in number and our heroes must retreat. Let's suppose they retreat here, into this very tower. They skip across the little bridge and turn to face their foes at this very spot. The Britons grow confident. They have our cousins cornered. They press in with their swords and axes, hurry over the bridge towards our heroes. Our brave kin bring down the first of them, but soon must retreat further. Look there, boy. They retreat up those winding stairs along the wall. Still more Britons cross the moat until this space where we stand is filled. Yet the Britons' greater numbers can't yet be turned to advantage. For our brave cousins fight two abreast on the stairs, and the invaders can but meet them two against two. Our heroes are skilled, and though they retreat higher and higher, the invaders cannot overwhelm them. As Britons fall, those following take their place, then fall in their turn. But surely our cousins grow weary. Higher and higher they retreat, the invaders pursue them stair by stair. But what's this? What's this, Edwin? Do our kin finally lose their nerve? They turn and run the remaining circles of steps, only now and then striking behind them. This is surely the end. The Britons are triumphant. Those watching from down here smile like hungry men before a banquet. But look carefully, boy. What do you see? What do you see as our Saxon cousins near that halo of sky above?" Grasping Edwin's shoulders, Wistan repositioned him, pointing up to the opening. "Speak, boy. What do you see?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"It was foolish of you to come back as you did, and after you'd made good your escape. Father Jonus was angry to hear of it. But here you are, safely away again, and with luck no one's the wiser about your return. But what an affair this is! Is your brother always so quarrelsome? Or is it one of the soldiers made some fierce insult to him in passing? Perhaps once you reach his bedside, young cousin, you'll ask him how it all began, for none of us can make head or tail of it. If it was he who insulted the soldiers, then it must have been something strong indeed, for they as one forgot whatever purpose brought them to see the abbot, and turning into wild men, set about trying to extract payment for his boldness. I myself woke at the sounds of the shouting, even though my own chamber's far from the courtyard. I ran there in alarm, only to stand helpless alongside my fellow monks, watching in horror all that unfolded. Your brother, they soon told me, had run into the ancient tower to escape the wrath of the soldiers, and though they rushed in after him with a mind to tear him limb from limb, it seems he began to fight them as best he knew. And a surprising match he seemed to be, even though they were thirty or more and he just one Saxon shepherd. We watched expecting any moment to see his bloody remains brought out, and instead it's soldier after soldier running from that tower in panic, or staggering out carrying wounded comrades. We could hardly believe our eyes! We were praying for the quarrel soon to end, for whatever the original insult, such violence's surely uncalled for. Yet it went on and on, and then, young cousin, the dreadful accident occurred. Who knows it wasn't God himself, frowning on so black a quarrel within his holy buildings, pointed a finger and struck them with fire? More likely it was one of the soldiers running back and forth with torches tripped and made his great error. The horror of it! Suddenly the tower was ablaze! And who'd think an old damp tower could offer so much kindling? Yet blaze it did and Lord Brennus's men together with your brother caught within. They'd have done better forgetting their quarrel at once and running out as fast as they could, but I fancy they thought instead to fight the flames, and saw only too late the fires engulfing them. An accident of true ghastliness, and the few who came out did so just to die twisting horribly on the ground. Yet miracle of miracles, young cousin, your brother it turns out escaped! Father Ninian found him wandering the darkness of the grounds, dazed and wounded, but still alive, even as the rest of us watched the blazing tower and prayed for the trapped men inside. Your brother lives, but Father Jonus, who himself treated his wounds, has counselled the few of us who know this news to keep it a solemn secret, even from the abbot himself. For he fears if the news gets further, Lord Brennus will send out more soldiers seeking vengeance, not caring that most died by accident and not by your brother's hand. You'd do well not to whisper a word of it to anyone, at least not until you're both far from this country. Father Jonus was angry you should risk yourself returning to the monastery, yet he's contented he can the more easily reunite you with your brother. 'They must travel together out of this country,' he said. The best of men is Father Jonus, and still our wisest, even after what the birds have done to him. I dare say your brother owes him and Father Ninian his life."</div>
