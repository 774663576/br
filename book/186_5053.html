<div class="line_en">The children were facing one another across the pillar where the bell hung, still trembling, though it no longer gave out any note. Suddenly they heard a soft noise from the end of the room which was still undamaged. They turned quick as lightning to see what it was. One of the robed figures, the furthest-off one of all, the woman whom Digory thought so beautiful, was rising from its chair. When she stood up they realized that she was even taller than they had thought. And you could see at once, not only from her crown and robes, but from the flash of her eyes and the curve of her lips, that she was a great queen. She looked round the room and saw the damage and saw the children, but you could not guess from her face what she thought of either or whether she was surprised. She came forward with long, swift strides.</div>

<div class="line_en">After she had studied him for well over a minute, she let go of his chin and said: "You are no magician. The mark of it is not on you. You must be only the servant of a magician. It is on another's Magic that you have travelled here."</div>

<div class="line_en">"There is great peril here," said the Queen. "The whole palace is breaking up. If we are not out of it in a few minutes we shall be buried under the ruin." She spoke as calmly as if she had been merely mentioning the time of day. "Come," she added, and held out a hand to each of the children. Polly, who was disliking the Queen and feeling rather sulky, would not have let her hand be taken if she could have helped it. But though the Queen spoke so calmly, her movements were as quick as thought. Before Polly knew what was happening her left hand had been caught in a hand so much larger and stronger than her own that she could do nothing about it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“灾祸来了，”女王说，“整个宫殿就要塌掉。如果我们不在几分钟内出去，就会被埋在废墟里。”她说得平平静静，好像只是在谈论一天的时辰。“来。”她说着，向两个孩子各伸出一只手。波莉讨厌这个女王并且仍在生气，如果可能的话，她决不会让她抓住自己的手。女王虽然说话时显得不慌不忙，但行动却像思维一样敏捷。波莉还未反应过来，她的左于就被一只长得多、有力得多的大手抓住了，她根本无法挣脱。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Queen led them out of the Hall of Images into a long corridor and then through a whole maze of halls and stairs and courtyards. Again and again they heard parts of the great palace collapsing, sometimes quite close to them. Once a huge arch came thundering down only a moment after they had passed through it. The Queen was walking quickly -- the children had to trot to keep up with her but she showed no sign of fear. Digory thought, "She's wonderfully brave. And strong. She's what I call a Queen! I do hope she's going to tell us the story of this place."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="女王带领他们出了塑像厅，来到一条长长的走廊，又接二连三地穿过许多大厅、台阶和院子。他们不断地听见那座大宫殿里传来坍塌的声音。有一次，他们刚刚走过，一个巨大的拱门就轰降隆地塌了下来。女王健步疾走——孩子们不得不小跑若才能跟上——而她也并未露出害怕的神色。迪格雷想，“她真是勇敢得出奇，又强壮，这才是我心目中的女王！要是能让她讲讲这儿的故事该多好！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"This is a terrible woman," thought Polly. "She's strong enough to break my arm with one twist. And now that she's got my left hand I can't get at my yellow ring. If I tried to stretch across and get my right hand into my left pocket I mightn't be able to reach it, before she asked me what I was doing. Whatever happens we mustn't let her know about the rings. I do hope Digory has the sense to keep his mouth shut. I wish I could get a word with him alone."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这是一个可怕的女人，”波莉想，“她太有劲了，稍稍一打就会把我的手臂弄断。现在，她拉住我的左手，我摸不到黄戒指了。要是我把右手伸到左边口袋里，就可以在她问我干什么之前摸到戒指。无论如何，不能让她知道戒指的事。我真希望迪格雷能守口如瓶，也希望能亲口叮嘱他一句。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Queen let go of his hand and raised her arm. She drew herself up to her full height and stood rigid. Then she said something which they couldn't understand (but it sounded horrid) and made an action as if she were throwing something towards the doors. And those high and heavy doors trembled for a second as if they were made of silk and then crumbled away till there was nothing left of them but a heap of dust on the threshold.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="女工放开他，举起手臂，尽量往上挺直，然后，她说了几句他们听不懂的话（但听起来很恐怖），朝门做了一个扔东西的动作。那些高而重的门像丝织品一样震颤了一秒钟便塌了卜来，彻彻底底地毁坏了，门槛七只剩下一堆灰。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She did tell them certain things as they went along:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她边走边告诉他们“那道门里是地牢”，">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That is the door to the dungeons," she would say, or "That passage leads to the principal torture chambers," or "This was the old banqueting hall where my greatgrandfather bade seven hundred nobles to a feast and killed them all before they had drunk their fill.

<div class="line_en">They came at last into a hall larger and loftier than any they had yet seen. From its size and from the great doors at the far end, Digory thought that now at last they must be coming to the main entrance. In this he was quite right. The doors were dead black, either ebony or some black metal which is not found in our world. They were fastened with great bars, most of them too high to reach and all too heavy to lift. He wondered how they would get out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，他们走进一间比先前见到的所有房间都更大更高的厅堂，从它的规模和尽头那些大型的门洞来看，迪格雷认为他们到了主要的入口处。这次，他猜对了。门呈乌黑色，要么是用乌木，要么是用一种我们这个世界找不到的黑色金属做的。门上牢牢地拴着许多大门闩，大多数都高不可及，重不可举。他感到纳闷的是他们如何出去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Has your master magician, your uncle, power like mine?" asked the Queen, firmly seizing Digory's hand again. "But I shall know later. In the meantime, remember what you have seen. This is what happens to things, and to people, who stand in my way."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你的魔法师主人，你的舅舅，有我这种力量吗？”女王又紧紧地抓住了迪格雷的手。“不过我以后会知道的。记住你们今天看见的事。对物如此，对挡住我去路的人也是如此。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Much more light than they had yet seen in that country was pouring in through the now empty doorway, and when the Queen led them out through it they were not surprised to find themselves in the open air. The wind that blew in their faces was cold, yet somehow stale. They were looking from a high terrace and there was a great landscape out below them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="光从敞开的门洞里射了进来。在这个国家里，他们还从未见过比这更充足的光线。女王带着他们穿过门口，当他们发现自己兰身户外时并没有感到惊奇。他们站在一个高高的台地上，俯瞰着脚下宽广的景致。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Whew!" whistled Digory.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嘘！”迪格雷轻轻地吹了一声口哨。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Low down and near the horizon hung a great, red sun, far bigger than our sun. Digory felt at once that it was also older than ours: a sun near the end of its life, weary of looking down upon that world. To the left of the sun, and higher up, there was a single star, big and bright. Those were the only two things to be seen in the dark sky; they made a dismal group. And on the earth, in every direction, as far as the eye could reach, there spread a vast city in which there was no living thing to be seen. And all the temples, towers, palaces, pyramids, and bridges cast long, disastrous-looking shadows in the light of that withered sun. Once a great river had flowed through the city, but the water had long since vanished, and it was now only a wide ditch of grey dust.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="往下看，只见一轮比我们的太阳大得多的红太阳在地平线附近，迪格雷立刻就觉得那轮太阳比我们的太阳老：这幕年的太阳已经厌倦于俯视下面的世界。太阳的左上方，有一颗大而亮的星星。黑暗的天空中，残阳和孤星组成了一幅阴郁的画面。地上，有一个不管从哪个方向极目远眺都望不到边际的巨大的城市。城市里不见活动着的人和物。所有的庙宇、楼塔、宫殿、金字塔和桥在衰弱的阳光下投下长长的悲哀的影子。城里曾经有一条河，但河床早已干涸，只刹下一条宽宽的灰色土沟。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="”没有。”迪格雷说。他想解释安德鲁舅舅并没有统治任何城市。但女王接着说：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Look well on that which no eyes will ever see again," said the Queen. "Such was Charn, that great city, the city of the King of Kings, the wonder of the world, perhaps of all worlds. Does your uncle rule any city as great as this, boy?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"It is silent now. But I have stood here when the whole air was full of the noises of Charn; the trampling of feet, the creaking of wheels, the cracking of the whips and the groaning of slaves, the thunder of chariots, and the sacrificial drums beating in the temples. I have stood here (but that was near the end) when the roar of battle went up from every street and the river of Charn ran red." She paused and added, "All in one moment one woman blotted it out for ever."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“现在很安静。但是当空中充斥着恰恩的各种声音那会儿，我曾站在这里。脚步声、车轮声、鞭子的抽打声和奴隶的呻吟，还有马车的轰响以及寺庙里献祭的鼓声。当战斗开始，每条街道上杀声四起，恰恩河水被鲜血染红的时候，我也曾站在这儿（但那时一切都快完了）。”停了一下，她又说，“一个女人顷刻间便将这一切永远地抹去了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It was my sister's fault," said the Queen. "She drove me to it. May the curse of all the Powers rest upon her forever! At any moment I was ready to make peace -- yes and to spare her life too, if only she would yield me the throne. But she would not. Her pride has destroyed the whole world. Even after the war had begun, there was a solemn promise that neither side would use Magic. But when she broke her promise, what could I do? Fool! As if she did not know that I had more Magic than she! She even knew that I had the secret of the Deplorable Word. Did she think -- she was always a weakling -- that I would not use it?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是我姐姐的错，”女王说，“她逼我干的。让所有的神都永远地诅咒她吧！那时，我随时都准备讲和——是的，只要她让位给我，我就饶她不死。但她不干，她的傲慢毁了整个世界。甚至在战争开始以后，双方都郑重地保证不使用魔法，但她不守信用，我怎么办呢？傻瓜：好像她不知道我的魔法比她的大似的。她还知道我握了灭绝咒的秘密。她以为——她始终是个弱者——她以为我不会使用这个秘咒吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That was the secret of secrets," said the Queen Jadis. "It had long been known to the great kings of our race that there was a word which, if spoken with the proper ceremonies, would destroy all living things except the one who spoke it. But the ancient kings were weak and softhearted and bound themselves and all who should come after them with great oaths never even to seek after the knowledge of that word. But I learned it in a secret place and paid a terrible price to learn it. I did not use it until she forced me to it. I fought to overcome her by every other means. I poured out the blood of my armies like water --"</div>

Then I waited till we were so close that we could see one another's faces. She flashed her horrible, wicked eyes upon me and said, "Victory." "Yes," said I, "Victory, but not yours."

<div class="line_en">Polly and Digory looked at each other, aghast. Polly had disliked the Queen from the first; and even Digory, now that he had heard the story, felt that he had seen quite as much of her as he wanted. Certainly, she was not at all the sort of person one would like to take home. And if they did like, they didn't know how they could. What they wanted was to get away themselves: but Polly couldn't get at her ring and of course Digory couldn't go without her. Digory got very red in the face and stammered.</div>
