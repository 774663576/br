<div class="line_en">"Charlie, we've still got that strictly need-to-know company situation going. I know it's been more than a week since you saw Renesmee, but a visit is just not a good idea right now. How about I bring Renesmee over to see you?"</div>

<div class="line_en">I was only half paying attention to Charlie -- enough to notice the strange reluctance in his voice when he spoke of Billy, but not enough to worry what that was about.

<div class="line_en">This trip was about more than protecting my father from the twenty-seven oddly matched vampires -- who all had sworn not to kill anyone in a three-hundred-mile radius, but still… Obviously, no human being should get anywhere near this group.

We sat on our thrones and thought ourselves gods. We didn't notice for a long time that we were changing -- almost petrifying. I suppose the Volturi did us one favor when they burned our castles.

<div class="line_en">As we drove in silence, I squinted through the annoying contacts into the cold rain; it wasn't quite cold enough for snow.

This morning she'd been trying to find out if I could push the shield away from my mind altogether.

<div class="line_en">The buildings -- all three stories, all narrow, all leaning slightly as if bowed by the pounding rain -- were mostly old houses divided up into multiple apartments. It was hard to tell what color the peeling paint was supposed to be. Everything had faded to shades of gray. A few of the buildings had businesses on the first floor: a dirty bar with the windows painted black, a psychic's supply store with neon hands and tarot cards glowing fitfully on the door, a tattoo parlor, and a daycare with duct tape holding the broken front window together. There were no lamps on inside any of the rooms, though it was grim enough outside that the humans should have needed the light.

<div class="line_en">I examined the man behind the desk while April made a hasty retreat. He was short and balding, probably around fifty-five, with a paunch. He wore a red silk tie with a blue -- and-white-striped shirt, and his navy blazer hung over the back of his chair. He was also trembling, blanched to a sickly paste color, with sweat beading on his forehead; I imagined an ulcer churning away under the spare tire.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="趁艾普丽尔急忙退出去的时候我观察了一下桌子后的那个人。是个秃头的矮个子，55岁左右，啤酒肚，穿着蓝白相间的衬衫加红色丝质领带，藏蓝色西装外套搭在椅背上。他焦虑着，脸色病态的苍白，像浆糊一样，额头上尽是汗珠。这让我联想到后车厢里腐烂融化了的备用胎。">查看中文翻译</div>
