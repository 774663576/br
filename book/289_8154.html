<div class="line_en">The next day was rainy and dark. Rain fell on the roof of the barn and dripped steadily from the eaves. Rain fell in the barnyard and ran in crooked courses down into the lane where thistles and pigweed grew. Rain spattered against Mrs. Zuckerman's kitchen windows and came gushing out of the downspouts. Rain fell on the backs of the sheep as they grazed in the meadow. When the sheep tired of standing in the rain, they walked slowly up the lane and into the fold.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“当然，我想你一定不愿孵出一群啄木鸟来，”威伯酸溜溜地说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Certainly not," said the lamb. "In the first place, I cannot get into your pen, as I am not old enough to jump over the fence. In the second place, I am not interested in pigs. Pigs mean less than nothing to me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然不能了，”一只羊羔说。“首先，我无法进到你的院子里，因为我还太小，跳不过这篱笆。其次，我对猪一点儿也不感兴趣。照我看，猪比啥都不是还不是。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“抱歉，宝贝儿，抱歉，”母鹅说。”我正在孵我的蛋呢。他们共有八个，得时刻让他们又干——干——干又暖。因此我只好呆在这儿，不能走——走——走开。我孵蛋时不能玩儿。我盼着能早点孵出小鹅来。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你能来和我一起玩儿吗？”他请求。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What do you mean, less than nothing?" replied Wilbur. "I don't think there is any such thing as less than nothing. Nothing is absolutely the limit of nothingness. It's the lowest you can go. It's the end of the line. How can something be less than nothing? If there were something that was less than nothing, then nothing would not be nothing, it would be something-even though it's just a very little bit of something. But if nothing is nothing, then nothing has nothing that is less than it is."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“什么叫比啥都不是还不是？”威伯回答。“我不认为有什么东西会比啥都不是还不是。‘啥都不是‘已经不是到了顶了，那绝对是天地的顶端，世界的尽头了。怎么可能还会有比啥都不是还不是的东西呢？要是你说得对，那‘啥都不是‘就该是点啥，哪怕只是那么一丁点儿。但是如果‘啥都不是‘就是‘啥都不是‘，那么你就找不到会比啥都不是还不是的东西。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Play?" said Templeton, twirling his whiskers. "Play? I hardly know the meaning of the word."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“玩儿？”坦普尔曼说着，捻了捻他的胡子。“玩儿？我都不懂这词儿是什么意思。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well," said Wilbur, "it means to have fun, to frolic, to run and skip and make merry."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，”威伯说，“玩就是做游戏，嬉耍，跑跳，找乐子。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I never do those things if I can avoid them, " replied the rat, sourly. "I prefer to spend my time eating, gnawing, spying, and hiding. I am a glutton but not a merry-maker. Right now I am on my way to your trough to eat your breakfast, since you haven't got sense enough to eat it yourself." And Templeton, the rat, crept stealthily along the wall and disappeared into a private tunnel that he had dug between the door and the trough in Wilbur's yard. Templeton was a crafty rat, and he had things pretty much his own way. The tunnel was an example of his skill and cunning. The tunnel enabled him to get from the barn to his hiding place under the pig trough without coming out into the open. He had tunnels and runways all over Mr. Zuckerman's farm and could get from one place to another without being seen. Usually he slept during the daytime and was abroad only after dark.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我从不愿意在这些事儿上浪费时间。”耗子冷冷的回答。“我宁愿把我的时间用在吃，咬，偷，藏上面。我是一个贪吃的老鼠，不是游戏主义者。我要去吃你食槽里的早餐了，反正现在你也不想去吃。”老鼠坦普尔曼说完，便沿着墙缝爬进他开凿的那条贯穿门和食槽的秘密通道里去了。坦普尔曼是只非常狡猾的耗子，也很有些高明的手段。这条通道不过是他的狡猾与挖洞技巧的一个证明而已。这条通道能令他不用在谷仓的明处露面，就能在谷仓和自己在猪食槽下的藏身处来回。他在祖克曼先生的农场里挖了很多条地道，这样就可以不被发现的任意来去了。通常他都在白天睡觉，夜深才出来活动。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Wilbur watched him disappear into his tunnel. In a moment he saw the rat's sharp nose poke out from underneath the wooden trough. Cautiously Templeton pulled himself up over the edge of the trough. This was almost more than Wilbur could stand: on this dreary, rainy day to see his breakfast being eaten by somebody else. He knew Templeton was getting soaked, out there in the pouring rain, but even that didn't comfort him. Friendless, dejected, and hungry, he threw himself down in the manure and sobbed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="威伯看着他爬进了通道。瞬间来历，他就看见耗子的尖鼻头从木头食槽下面探出来。坦普尔曼小心地顺着食槽边爬了进去。威伯几乎再也不能忍受了：谁愿意在一个忧伤的下雨天，看到自己的早餐被别人吃掉呢？他知道外面的雨水正浇着在那里大嚼的坦普尔曼，可这也不会使他感到有所安慰。无助，失意，饥饿…他趴在牛粪堆里啜泣起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

You can imagine Wilbur's surprise when, out of the darkness, came a small voice he had never heard before. It sounded rather thin, but pleasant. "Do you want a friend, Wilbur?" it said. "I'll be a friend to you. I've watched you all day and I like you."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我就在这儿，”那个声音说。“你先睡吧。明早你就会看到我了。”夏洛特的夜晚似乎很长。威尔伯的肚子空了，脑子里满是。当你的胃是空的，你的头脑是满的，它总是很难入睡。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Approximately-oximately thirty days, all told," answered the goose. "But I cheat a little. On warm afternoons, I just pull a little straw over the eggs and go out for a walk."Wilbur yawned and went back to sleep. In his dreams he heard again the voice saying, "I'll be a friend to you. Go to sleep-you'll see me in the morning."About half an hour before dawn, Wilbur woke and listened. The barn was still dark. The sheep lay motionless. Even the goose was quiet. Overhead, on the main floor, nothing stirred: the cows were resting, the horses dozed. Templeton had quit work and gone off somewhere on an errand. The only sound was a slight scraping noise from the rooftop, where the weather-vane swung back and forth. Wilbur loved the barn when it was like this-calm and quiet, waiting for light.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“大约大约三十天，总的说来，回答说：“鹅”。但我有点作弊。在温暖的下午，我拉点稻草在鸡蛋，出去走一走。”威尔伯打了个哈欠，回去睡觉。在梦中他又听到一个声音说：“我会成为你的朋友。”。“睡觉吧，你会在早上看到我的。”大约天亮前半小时，威尔伯醒了，听着。谷仓还很黑。羊一动不动地躺着。连鹅都安静了。头顶上，在一楼，没有动静：牛在休息，马在打盹。坦普尔曼已经放弃工作去某地出差。唯一的声音是从屋顶发出轻微的刮擦声，风向标在那里来回摆动。威尔伯喜欢谷仓，就像这样安静安静，等待光明。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh, beautiful day, it is here at last! Today I shall find my friend."Wilbur looked everywhere. He searched his pen thoroughly. He examined the window ledge, stared up at the ceiling. But he saw nothing new. Finally he decided he would have to speak up. He hated to break the lovely stillness of dawn by using his voice, but he couldn't think of any other way to locate the mysterious new friend who was nowhere to be seen. So Wilbur cleared his throat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，美好的一天，终于到了。”！今天我要去找我的朋友。”威尔伯到处找。他彻底搜查了他的钢笔。他检查窗台，盯着天花板看。但他没有看到什么新鲜事。最后他决定要大声说出来。他不愿用自己的声音打破黎明时那令人愉快的寂静，但他想不出有什么别的办法可以找到那个神秘的新朋友，因为他根本就不见了。于是威尔伯清了清嗓子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I beg everyone's pardon," whispered Wilbur. "I didn't mean to be objectionable." He lay down meekly in the in the manure, facing the door. He did not know it, but his friend was very near. and the old sheep was right-the friend was still asleep.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Attention, please!" he said. "I will repeat the message. Will the party who addressed me at bedtime last night kindly speak up. Please tell me where you are, if you are my friend!"The sheep looked at each other in disgust.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Stop your nonsense, Wilbur!" said the oldest sheep. "If you have a new friend here, you are probably disturbing his rest; and the quickest way to spoil a friendship is to wake somebody up in the morning before he is ready. How can you be sure your friend is an early riser?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“别胡说了，威尔伯！”老绵羊说。如果你在这里有一个新朋友，你可能会打扰他的休息；和友谊是唤醒别人在早晨之前他准备破坏的最快途径。你怎么能确定你的朋友是个早起的人？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Soon Lurvy appeared with slops for breakfast. Wilbur rushed out, ate everything in a hurry, and licked the trough. The sheep moved off down the lane, the gander waddled along behind them, pulling grass. And then, just as Wilbur was settling down for his morning nap, he heard again the thin voice that had addressed him the night before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不久鲁维来送早饭了。威尔伯冲了出去，匆匆吃了所有东西，舔了锅。羊走下车道，公鹅摇摇摆摆地跟在后面，拉草。然后，正当威尔伯正准备睡午觉的时候，他又听到了前一天晚上对他说的那微弱的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"When I say 'salutations,' it's just my fancy way of saying hello or good morning. Actually, it's a silly expression, and I am surprised that I used it at all. As for my whereabouts, that's easy. Look up here in the corner of the door way! Here I am. Look, I'm waving!"At last Wilbur saw the creature that had spoken to him in such a kindly way. Stretched across the upper part of the doorway was a big spiderweb, and hanging from the top of the web, head down, was a large grey spider. She was about the size of a gumdrop. She had eight legs, and she was waving one of them at Wilbur in friendly greeting. "See me now?" she asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当我说‘致敬，这只是我的幻想的方式说你好或早上好。事实上，这是一个愚蠢的表达，我很惊讶我居然用了它。至于我的行踪，那很容易。在门口的拐角处往上看！我在这里。看，我在挥手！”最后，威尔伯看到了那个亲切友好地对他说话的家伙。躺在门口的上部是一个巨大的蜘蛛网，挂在网上，顶部的头，是一只大灰蜘蛛。她是一个水果糖的大小。她有八条腿，她友好地向威尔伯挥手致意。现在见我？”她问。">查看中文翻译</div>
