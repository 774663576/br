<div class="line_en">Guiliano was braver than all the others. His tactics in guerrilla warfare were unmatched, his ability to inspire love in the people of Sicily unequaled since Garibaldi. He was idealistic and romantic, and he had the feral cunning so admired by Sicilians. But he had flaws that Pisciotta saw and tried to correct.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉里安诺比其他人勇敢。在游击战术方面无人能出其右。自加里波第以来，谁也没能像他那样赢得西西里人民的热爱。他既是理想主义者，又是浪漫主义者。他身上具有西西里人所崇拜的充满野性的机敏。皮肖塔发现他身上也有缺点，并且想帮助他克服。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Guiliano insisted on giving at least fifty percent of the band's loot to the poor, Pisciotta told him, "You can be rich or you can be loved. You think the people of Sicily will rise and follow your banner in a war against Rome. They never will. They will love you when they take your money, they will hide you when you need sanctuary, they will never betray you. But they don't have a revolution in them."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉里安诺坚持认为至少要从他们抢夺来的东西中拿出一半分给穷人，皮肖塔则对他说：“你可以很富有，你也可以受人爱戴。你认为西西里人会揭竿而起，在你的旗帜下进行一场反对罗马的战争。他们绝对不会。他们接受你给的钱，他们会喜欢你；你需要庇护的时候，他们会把你藏起来；他们绝对不会背叛你。但是他们的内心是不想革命的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Pisciotta had always been loyal. Since childhood he had accepted Guiliano's leadership without jealousy. And Guiliano had always proclaimed that Pisciotta was co-leader of the band, not one of the subchiefs like Passatempo, Terranova, Andolini and the Corporal. But Guiliano's personality was so overwhelming that the co-leadership became a myth; Guiliano commanded. Pisciotta accepted this without reservation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮肖塔以前一直是忠心耿耿。从孩提时代开始他就服从吉里安诺的领导，从来没有嫉妒之心。吉里安诺总是说皮肖塔是他们组织的二把手，有别于帕萨藤珀、泰拉诺瓦、安多里尼和“下士”那样的头领。可是吉里安诺的人格魅力占了绝对优势，所以二把手的领导形同虚设，吉里安诺在指挥着一切。皮肖塔毫无保留地接受了这一切。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Pisciotta had opposed listening to the blandishments of Don Croce and the Christian Democratic party. He had opposed crushing the Communist and Socialist organizations in Sicily.</div>

<div class="line_en">Guiliano had always been a believer, an innocent; Pisciotta had always seen clearly. With the advent of Colonel Luca and his Special Force, Pisciotta knew the end had come. They could win a hundred victories, but a solitary defeat would mean their death. As Roland and Oliver had quarreled in the legend of Charlemagne, so Guiliano and Pisciotta had quarreled and Guiliano had been too stubborn in his heroism. Pisciotta had felt like Oliver, repeatedly begging Roland to blow his horn.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉里安诺一直是个有信仰的人，而且很单纯，这一点皮肖塔看得很清楚。皮肖塔知道，卢卡上校和特种部队的出现，就意味着他们的末日来临。他们纵然可能有过一百次的胜利，但是只要有一次重大失败就会给他们带来灭顶之灾。就像在查理大帝传说中的罗兰和奥利维争吵一样，吉里安诺和皮肖塔之间也发生了争吵，吉里安诺坚持他的英雄主义，而且非常固执。皮肖塔觉得自己很像奥利维，不断地恳求罗兰吹响号角。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Guiliano hoped for a pardon from the Christian Democrats, Pisciotta said, "They will never pardon you, and Don Croce can never permit you to have any power. Our destiny is to buy our way out of our banditry with money, or someday to die as bandits. It's not a bad way to die, not for me anyway." But Guiliano had not listened to him, and this finally aroused Pisciotta's resentment and started the growth of that hidden worm of treachery.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当吉里安诺希望得到基督教民主党政府赦免的时候，皮肖塔说：“他们永远不会赦免你。唐·克罗切决不会让你拥有权力。我们的命运是用钱买通一条脱离土匪的道路，否则我们总有一天就会像土匪那样死去。那样的死法也不坏，至少对我来说是这样。”可是吉里安诺没有听他的，这终于引起皮肖塔的反感，从而暗暗滋生了叛逆之心。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Don Croce had studied the relationship between Guiliano and Pisciotta closely for the last three years. They were the sole danger to his plans of empire. They were the only obstacles to his rule of Sicily. At first he had thought he could make Guiliano and his band the armed forces of the Friends of the Friends. He had sent Hector Adonis to sound Guiliano out. The proposition was clear. Turi Guiliano would be the great warrior. Don Croce the great statesman. But Guiliano would have to bend his knee, and this he refused to do. He had his own star to follow, to help the poor, to make Sicily a free country, to lift the yoke of Rome. This Don Croce could not comprehend.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在过去三年中，唐·克罗切仔细研究了吉里安诺和皮肖塔之间的关系。对于他的帝国计划来说，他们是唯一的危险。他们是他统治西西里的唯一障碍。他原本以为可以把吉里安诺和他的队伍变成友中友的武装。他曾经派赫克特·阿多尼斯对吉里安诺进行试探。他的意思很明确。图里·吉里安诺将成为伟大的武士，而唐·克罗切则成为伟大的政治活动家。但是，这样吉里安诺就必须屈膝，他不肯这样做。他有自己的理想，他要帮助穷人，要使西西里获得自由，要松开罗马强加于他们的枷锁。这是唐·克罗切无法理解的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">What worried Pisciotta most was that Guiliano, who had found love and tenderness in a young girl, had become more ferocious as a bandit. He killed carabinieri where previously he had captured them. He had executed Passatempo while on his honeymoon. He showed no mercy to anyone he suspected of informing. Pisciotta was in terror that the man he had loved and defended all these years might turn on him. He worried that if Guiliano learned of some of the things he had recently done, he, too, might be executed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最让皮肖塔担心的是，吉里安诺得到了一个年轻姑娘的爱情和温情，但却变成了一个更为凶残的土匪。他以前只是把宪兵抓起来，现在却要把他们杀掉。他在蜜月期间处决了帕萨藤珀。他对他所怀疑的告密者从不心慈手软。皮肖塔感到恐惧的是，这些年来他一直热爱并且保卫的这个人有可能与他反目。他担心如果他最近做的一些事被吉里安诺知道了，他也可能被处决。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then when Guiliano fell in love with Justina and married her, Pisciotta realized his and Guiliano's destinies were indeed separate. Guiliano would escape to America, have a wife and children. He, Pisciotta, would be a fugitive forever. He would never have a long life; a bullet or his lung disease would finish him off. That was his destiny. He could never live in America.</div>

<div class="line_en">But from 1943 to 1947, Guiliano's star was in ascendency. The Don still had to forge the Friends into one unified force. The Friends had not recovered from the terrible decimation of their ranks by Mussolini's Fascist government. So the Don gentled Guiliano's power by enticing him into an alliance with the Christian Democratic party. Meanwhile he built the Mafia empire anew and bided his time. His first stroke, the engineering of the massacre at the Portella della Ginestra, with the blame falling on Guiliano, had been a masterpiece, but he could not claim the credit his due. That stroke destroyed any chance that the government in Rome might pardon Guiliano and support his bid for power in Sicily. It also stained forever the hero's mantle Guiliano wore as the champion of the poor in Sicily. And when Guiliano executed the six Mafia chiefs the Don had no choice. The Friends of the Friends and Guiliano's band had to fight each other to the death.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从1943年到1947年，吉里安诺的命运之星处于上升时期。克罗切仍然忙于把友中友打造成一支统一的力量。黑手党还没有从墨索里尼法西斯政府的摧残中恢复元气。所以他对吉里安诺的力量采取了怀柔政策，诱使他和基督教民主党结盟。与此同时他重振黑手党，等待时机东山再起。他的第一招就是策划了吉里斯特拉山口的大屠杀，让吉里安诺背上黑锅。这是他的杰作，可是他又不能把功劳记在他自己的名下。这一招使罗马政府赦免吉里安诺、支持他在西西里竞选的任何可能性都化成了泡影。这一招也使吉里安诺的“西西里人民英雄”的名声沾染了永久性的污点。吉里安诺处决六名黑手党头领的时候，唐·克罗切已经别无选择。友中友和吉里安诺的武装不得不一决雌雄。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So Don Croce had focused more intently on Pisciotta. Pisciotta was clever, but as young men are clever -- that is, he did not give full weight to the hidden terror and evil in the hearts of the best of men. And Pisciotta too had a taste for the fruits and temptations of the world. Where Guiliano disdained money, Pisciotta loved the rewards money brought. Guiliano did not have a penny for his personal fortune though he had earned over a billion lire with his crimes. He distributed his share of the spoils to the poor and to help support his family.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是唐·克罗切把更多的注意力集中在皮肖塔身上。皮肖塔很聪明，但只是年轻人的那种聪明——也就是说，他没有充分认识到，最好的人心里也有潜在的恐怖与邪恶。皮肖塔已品尝到外部世界的果实和诱惑。吉里安诺对金钱嗤之以鼻，而皮肖塔却喜欢金钱带来的回报。虽然吉里安诺的犯罪活动给他带来数十亿里拉的钱财，可是他自己连一个子儿也没有拿。他把自己分得的那一部分钱财都给了穷人，也有一些用于养活自己的家人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But Don Croce had observed that Pisciotta wore the finest tailored suits in Palermo and visited the most expensive prostitutes. Also that Pisciotta's family lived much better than Guiliano's. And Don Croce learned that Pisciotta had money stored in Palermo's banks under false names, and had taken other precautions that only a man interested in staying alive would make. Like false identity papers in three different names, a safe house prepared in Trapani. And Don Croce knew that all this was a secret held from Guiliano. So he awaited Pisciotta's visit, a visit requested by Pisciotta, who had known the Don's house was always open to him, with interest and pleasure. And also with prudence and foresight. He was surrounded by armed guards, and he had alerted Colonel Luca and Inspector Velardi to be ready for a conference if all went well. If it did not, if he had misjudged Pisciotta or if this was a triple-dyed treachery cooked up by Guiliano to have the Don killed, then it would be the grave for Aspanu Pisciotta.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是唐·克罗切注意到，皮肖塔穿的是巴勒莫裁剪最得体的服装，去的是费用最昂贵的妓院。皮肖塔家的生活比吉里安诺家的好得多。唐·克罗切还了解到，皮肖塔用假名字在巴勒莫多家银行里存了钱，还采取了一些只有渴望生存的人才会采取的措施，比如拥有三个不同名字的假证件，此外在特拉帕尼还有一处安全屋。唐·克罗切知道这些都是他背着吉里安诺干的，因此他等待皮肖塔主动造访。因为皮肖塔知道克罗切会兴致盎然、欢欣鼓舞地迎接他，当然也十分谨慎，深谋远略。克罗切由武装保镖簇拥着，此外他还提醒卢卡上校和韦拉尔迪警督，如果一切正常，就准备开一次会议。如果情况不妙，如果他对皮肖塔的判断是错误的，如果这是一个吉里安诺刺杀他的阴谋，那么阿斯帕努·皮肖塔就将有来无回。">查看中文翻译</div>

"When we are children, when we are young, it is natural to love our friends, to be generous to them, to forgive their faults. Each day is fresh, we look forward to the future with pleasure and without fear. The world itself is not so dangerous; it is a happy time. But as we grow old and have to earn our bread, friendship does not endure so easily. We must always be on our guard. Our elders no longer look after us, we are no longer content with those simple pleasures of children. Pride grows in us -- we wish to become great or powerful or rich, or simply to guard ourself against misfortune. I know how much you love Turi Guiliano, but now you must ask yourself, what is the price of this love? And after all these years does it still exist or is it just the memory that exists?" He waited for Pisciotta to make an answer, but Pisciotta looked at him with a face stonier than the rocks on the Cammarata Mountains and as white. For Pisciotta's face had gone very pale.</div>

<div class="line_en">And so on the evening of July 5, as Pisciotta made his way to Castelvetrano, he had committed himself to Don Croce.
