<div class="line_en">The Lion was pacing to and fro about that empty land and singing his new song. It was softer and more lilting than the song by which he had called up the stars and the sun; a gentle, rippling music. And as he walked and sang the valley grew green with grass. It spread out from the Lion like a pool. It ran up the sides of the little hills like a wave. In a few minutes it was creeping up the lower slopes of the distant mountains, making that young world every moment softer. The light wind could now be heard ruffling the grass. Soon there were other things besides grass. The higher slopes grew dark with heather. Patches of rougher and more bristling green appeared in the valley. Digory did not know what they were until one began coming up quite close to him. It was a little, spiky thing that threw out dozens of arms and covered these arms with green and grew larger at the rate of about an inch every two seconds. There were dozens of these things all round him now. When they were nearly as tall as himself he saw what they were. "Trees!" he exclaimed.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Stop!" cried the Witch. "Stand back. No, further back. If anyone goes within ten paces of either of the children, I will knock out his brains." She was poising in her hand the iron bar that she had torn off the lamp-post, ready to throw it. Somehow no one doubted that she would be a very good shot.</div>

<div class="line_en">The nuisance of it, as Polly said afterwards, was that you weren't left in peace to watch it all. Just as Digory said "Trees!" he had to jump because Uncle Andrew had sidled up to him again and was going to pick his pocket. It wouldn't have done Uncle Andrew much good if he had succeeded, for he was aiming at the right-hand pocket because he still thought the green rings were "homeward" rings. But of course Digory didn't want to lose either.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="令人沮丧的是，正如波莉以后说的，你无法安安静静地观赏这一切。迪格雷说“树”的同时，他不得不跳到一边，因为安德鲁舅舅又悄悄溜到他身旁，企图偷他的戒指。即使他偷到手也没有多大好处，因为他一直以为绿戒指管返回，便把目标对准右边口袋。当然，迪格雷也不想让他得逞。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Uncle Andrew's temper at last got the better of his fears. "Yes, Ma'am, I would," he said. "Most undoubtedly I would. I should be perfectly in my rights. I have been most shamefully, most abominably treated. I have done my best to show you such civilities as were in my power. And what has been my reward? You have robbed -- I must repeat the word robbed a highly respectable jeweller. You have insisted on my entertaining you to an exceedingly expensive, not to say ostentatious, lunch, though I was obliged to pawn my watch and chain in order to do so (and let me tell you, Ma'am, that none of our family have been in the habit of frequenting pawnshops, except my cousin Edward, and he was in the Yeomanry). During that indigestible meal -- I'm feeling the worse for it at this very moment -- your behaviour and conversation attracted the unfavourable attention of everyone present. I feel I have been publicly disgraced. I shall never be able to show my face in that restaurant again. You have assaulted the police. You have stolen --"</div>

<div class="line_en">All this time the Lion's song, and his stately prowl, to and fro, backwards and forwards, was going on. What was rather alarming was that at each turn he came a little nearer. Polly was finding the song more and more interesting because she thought she was beginning to see the connection between the music and the things that were happening. When a line of dark firs sprang up on a ridge about a hundred yards away she felt that they were connected with a series of deep, prolonged notes which the Lion had sung a second before. And when he burst into a rapid series of lighter notes she was not surprised to see primroses suddenly appearing in every direction. Thus, with an unspeakable thrill, she felt quite certain that all the things were coming (as she said) "out of the Lion's head". When you listened to his song you heard the things he was making up: when you looked round you, you saw them. This was so exciting that she had no time to be afraid. But Digory and the Cabby could not help feeling a bit nervous as each turn of the Lion's walk brought him nearer. As for Uncle Andrew, his teeth were chattering, but his knees were shaking so that he could not run away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这段时间里，狮子一直不停地唱着歌，庄严地前后左右走动。使人惊异的是，它每次转身，都离他们更近一些。波莉发现，歌声越来越有趣，因为她觉得自己开始看出了音乐与眼前发生的事之间的联系。当大约百米外的山脊上跳出一排墨绿色的冷杉树时，她感到这和一秒钟前狮子唱的一组低沉、悠长的音调紧密相关。豪不奇怪，随着狮了唱出一组轻快的旋律，她看到报春花从四面八方长了出来。在一阵无以言表的激动中，她肯定所有这些都是从（用她的话说）“狮子脑袋里出来的”。当你聆听它歌唱时，你就听见了它所创造的事物：当你环顾四周，你就能看见这些事物。这太令人激动了，她无暇感到害怕。但狮子每一次转身离他们更近时，迪格雷和马车夫都不禁有些紧张，安德鲁舅舅则牙齿打战，双膝发抖，根本跑不掉了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was certainly plenty to watch and to listen to. The tree which Digory had noticed was now a full-grown beech whose branches swayed gently above his head. They stood on cool, green grass, sprinkled with daisies and buttercups. A little way off, along the river bank, willows were growing. On the other side tangles of flowering currant, lilac, wild rose, and rhododendron closed them in. The horse was tearing up delicious mouthfuls of new grass.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="值得看和值得听的实在太多了。迪格雷最先看见的那棵树己经长成一棵粗壮的山毛榉，枝丫优美地在他头顶上舒展。他们站立的那片凉爽的青草地上散布着雏菊和毛莨属植物。稍远的地方，沿河生长着柳树。河的对岸，绽放着一丛丛茶藨子、丁香花、野玫瑰和杜鹃花。那匹马大口大口地撕咬着新鲜的草。，">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Witch shrieked and ran: in a few moments she was out of sight among the trees. Uncle Andrew turned to do likewise, tripped over a root, and fell flat on his face in a little brook that ran down to join the river. The children could not move. They were not even quite sure that they wanted to. The Lion paid no attention to them. Its huge red mouth was open, but open in song not in a snarl. It passed by them so close that they could have touched its mane. They were terribly afraid it would turn and look at them, yet in some queer way they wished it would. But for all the notice it took of them they might just as well have been invisible and unsmellable. When it had passed them and gone a few paces further it turned, passed them again, and continued its march eastward.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="女巫尖叫一声跑开了，很快便消头在树林中。安德鲁舅舅转身想跟着跑，不料绊倒在一根树桩上，脸朝下倒在流向大河的一条小溪中。孩子们无法动弹。他们甚至不能肯定自己是否想跑。狮子根本没有注意他们。它张着血红的大口，没有咆哮，只是歌唱。它与他们擦身而过，他们可以摸到它的皮毛。两人害怕极了，怕它转过身看着自己。但奇怪的是，他们又希望它转过身来。从开始到现在．他们好像是看不见闻不着的东西，丝豪没有引起它的注意。它从他们身边过去，走了几步，又折回来，两次与他们擦身而过，转向东去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Nobody, least of all Jadis, could have missed at that range. The bar struck the Lion fair between the eyes. It glanced off and fell with a thud in the grass. The Lion came on. Its walk was neither slower nor faster than before; you could not tell whether it even knew it had been hit. Though its soft pads made no noise, you could feel the earth shake beneath their weight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="任何，更不用说简蒂丝，都不会在这么近的距离打偏。铁棒不偏不倚地敲在狮子的两眼之间，然后一掠而过，砰的一声落在草中。但狮子没有停下，步伐既未减慢也未增快，很难说它是否知道自己被打了一下。虽然它柔软的爪子没发出任何声响，你却能感到大地在它的脚下震颇。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Suddenly the Witch stepped boldly out towards the Lion. It was coming on, always singing, with a slow, heavy pace. It was only twelve yards away. She raised her arm and flung the iron bar straight at its head.</div>

He certainly was a dreadful sight by now: for of course, the more dressed up you were to begin with, the worse you look after you've crawled out of a smashed hansoncab and fallen into a muddy brook. "I'm not saying," he added, "that this is not a most interesting place. If I were a younger man, now -- perhaps I could get some lively young fellow to come here first. One of those big-game hunters. Something might be made of this country. The climate is delightful. I never felt such air. I believe it would have done me good if -- if circumstances had been more favourable. If only we'd had a gun."</div>

I wonder what they'll say now? I have discovered a world where everything is bursting with life and growth. Columbus, now, they talk about Columbus. But what was America to this? The commercial possibilities of this country are unbounded. Bring a few old bits of scrap iron here, bury 'em, and up they come as brand new railway engines, battleships, anything you please. They'll cost nothing, and I can sell 'em at full prices in England. I shall be a millionaire. And then the climate! I feel years younger already. I can run it as a health resort. A good sanatorium here might be worth twenty thousand a year. Of course I shall have to let a few people into the secret. The first thing is to get that brute shot."</div>

In all directions it was swelling into humps. They were of very different sizes, some no bigger than mole-hills, some as big as wheel-barrows, two the size of cottages. And the humps moved and swelled till they burst, and the crumbled earth poured out of them, and from each hump there came out an animal. The moles came out just as you might see a mole come out in England. The dogs came out, barking the moment their heads were free, and struggling as you've seen them do when they are getting through a narrow hole in a hedge. The stags were the queerest to watch, for of course the antlers came up a long time before the rest of them, so at first Digory thought they were trees. The frogs, who all came up near the river, went straight into it with a plop-plop and a loud croaking. The panthers, leopards and things of that sort, sat down at once to wash the loose earth off their hind quarters and then stood up against the trees to sharpen their front claws. Showers of birds came out of the trees. Butterflies fluttered. Bees got to work on the flowers as if they hadn't a second to lose. But the greatest moment of all was when the biggest hump broke like a small earthquake and out came the sloping back, the large, wise head, and the four baggy-trousered legs of an elephant. And now you could hardly hear the song of the Lion; there was so much cawing, cooing, crowing, braying, neighing, baying, barking, lowing, bleating, and trumpeting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="你能想像一块草地像壶里的水一样沸腾吗，但这样描述正存发生的事是最最恰当的。周围的草地膨胀成个个大小不同的圆丘，有的只有鼹鼠丘那么大，有的和独轮小车相差无几，其中两个与小棚屋一般大小。这些圆丘移动着，膨胀着，直到泥土四溅地炸开后，每个圆丘里都钻出一样动物。鼹鼠出来时与你在英国见的鼹鼠出洞一模一样。狗一伸出脑袋就汪汪地叫，像从篱笆的窄缝里钻过时那样挣扎着。雄鹿是最有趣的，因为它们的角比只他部分先出来很长时间，所以，一开始迪格雷以为是树。青蛙从河岸边钻出来后，就呱呱地叫着，一蹦一蹦地跳到河里去了。花豹、黑豹一类的动物马上坐下来，将后腿上沾的松土抖掉，然后站起身，在树上磨前爪。林中传来阵阵鸟鸣。蜜蜂一秒钟也不愿耽误就在花上忙开了。但最壮观的时刻是当最大的圆丘像轻度地震一样炸裂开时，从里而隆起大象斜坡般的脊背、聪明的大脑袋和四条像穿着宽松裤子一般的大腿。现在，你几乎听不见狮子的歌唱了，四面八方，满耳的牛叫、马嘶、犬吠、鸟鸣…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Here! Stop! Come back! The boy's gone mad," said Uncle Andrew. He followed the children at a cautious distance behind; for he didn't want to get too far away from the green rings or too near the Lion.</div>

<div class="line_en">In a few minutes Digory came to the edge of the wood and there he stopped. The Lion was singing still. But now the song had once more changed. It was more like what we should call a tune, but it was also far wilder. It made you want to run and jump and climb. It made you want to shout. It made you want to rush at other people and either hug them or fight them. It made Digory hot and red in the face. It had some effect on Uncle Andrew, for Digory could hear him saying, "A spirited gel, sir. It's a pity about her temper, but a dem fine woman all the same, a dem fine woman." But what the song did to the two humans was nothing compared with what it was doing to the country.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几分钟后，迪格雷走到树林边上，站住了。狮子仍在歌唱。但歌声又变了。这次的歌声与我们所说的“调子”更为相似，但依然狂放不羁，使你想跳，想跑，想攀登，想大喊大叫，想冲向他人，拥抱他们或与他们搏斗。迪格雷听得脸上通红发热。安德鲁舅舅似乎也受了影晌，因为迪格雷听见他说：“一个活泼的姑娘，老兄。她的脾气令人遗憾，但总的来说，是个漂亮的女人，一个漂亮的女人。”然而，歌声对这两个人产生的效果根本无法与它对这片上地产生的效果相比。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But though Digory could no longer hear the Lion, he could see it. It was so big and so bright that he could not take his eyes off it. The other animals did not appear to be afraid of it. Indeed, at that very moment, Digory heard the sound of hoofs from behind; a second later the old cab-horse trotted past him and joined the other beasts. (The air had apparently suited him as well as it had suited Uncle Andrew. He no longer looked like the poor, old slave he had been in London; he was picking up his feet and holding his head erect.) And now, for the first time, the Lion was quite silent. He was going to and fro among the animals. And every now and then he would go up to two of them (always two at a time) and touch their noses with his. He would touch two beavers among all the beavers, two leopards among all the leopards, one stag and one deer among all the deer, and leave the rest. Some sorts of animal he passed over altogether. But the pairs which he had touched instantly left their own kinds and followed him. At last he stood still and all the creatures whom he had touched came and stood in a wide circle around him. The others whom he had not touched began to wander away. Their noises faded gradually into the distance. The chosen beasts who remained were now utterly silent, all with their eyes fixed intently upon the Lion. The cat-like ones gave an occasional twitch of the tail but otherwise all were still. For the first time that day there was complete silence, except for the noise of running water. Digory's heart beat wildly; he knew something very solemn was going to be done. He had not forgotten about his Mother; but he knew jolly well that, even for her, he couldn't interrupt a thing like this.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然迪格雷听不见狮子唱歌了，但仍然能看见它。它那么高大，那么明亮，将他牢牢地吸引住了。其他动物似乎也不怕它。就在这时，他听见阵马蹄声，那匹拉车的老马小跑右从他身边过去，和其他动物站到一起了（空气适合安德鲁舅舅也适合它，它看上去不再像伦敦街头可怜的老奴隶，它正扬起腿，高昂着头。）这时，狮子第一次安静下来。它在动物中巡视一番，时不时走到其中的两个面前（每次总是两个），用它的鼻子吻它们的鼻子：在花豹中挑出两头，在鹿群中挑出一头雄鹿和一头雌鹿，将其他的撇在一边。对有些种类的动物，它只是走过而已；但它吻过的动物成双成对地离开白己的群体，跟在它后面。最后，它站住了，它挑出来的动物也走过来，围着它站成一圈。它没有吻过的动物开始四下散开，叫声逐渐消失在远方。它选出来的那些动物静静地站着，所有的眼睛都紧紧地盯着狮子。猫类动物偶尔摇摇尾巴，其他的动物全都一动也不动。那天，第一次这么寂静，只听见淙淙的流水声。迪格雷的心在猛烈地跳动，他知道神圣而庄严的事情就要发生了。他已经忘了妈妈。但他非常清楚，即使为了她，他也不能打扰这样的大事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Lion, whose eyes never blinked, stared at the animals as hard as if he was going to burn them up with his mere stare. And gradually a change came over them. The smaller ones -- the rabbits, moles and such-like grew a good deal larger. The very big ones -- you noticed it most with the elephants -- grew a little smaller. Many animals sat up on their hind legs. Most put their heads on one side as if they were trying very hard to understand. The Lion opened his mouth, but no sound came from it; he was breathing out, a long, warm breath; it seemed to sway all the beasts as the wind sways a line of trees. Far overhead from beyond the veil of blue sky which hid them the stars sang again; a pure, cold, difficult music. Then there came a swift flash like fire (but it burnt nobody) either from the sky or from the Lion itself, and every drop of blood tingled in the children's bodies, and the deepest, wildest voice they had ever heard was saying:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不曾眨过眼的狮子用它那灼人的目光凝视着动物们。逐渐，那些动物起了变化。小动物一如兔子、睡鼠等——大了许多。庞大的动物——这一点从大象身上最能看出来——小了一些。许多动物用后腿坐着，其中大多数都偏着头，似乎在努力地试着理解什么。狮子张着嘴，却没有发声。像风刮起一排树一样，它呼出的绵长而温暖的气息可以将所有的动物都席卷而去。头上，遥远的空中，躲在蓝色天幕后面的星星又开始了新的歌唱。那是一种纯洁、清冷而难以理解的音乐。接着，从天上或狮子身上闪出一股火光。孩子们的每一滴血都沸腾起来。一个从未听到过的最低沉最粗犷的声音说道：">查看中文翻译</div>
