<div class="line_en">There was not a particle of difference in her manner. He had expected some change, subtle or abrupt; he fancied that there would be shame in the way she treated him, or anger, or perhaps some increase of familiarity; but there was nothing. She was exactly the same as before. They walked towards the sea all together, talking and laughing; and Sally was quiet, but she was always that, reserved, but he had never seen her otherwise, and gentle. She neither sought conversation with him nor avoided it. Philip was astounded. He had expected the incident of the night before to have caused some revolution in her, but it was just as though nothing had happened; it might have been a dream; and as he walked along, a little girl holding on to one hand and a little boy to the other, while he chatted as unconcernedly as he could, he sought for an explanation. He wondered whether Sally meant the affair to be forgotten. Perhaps her senses had run away with her just as his had, and, treating what had occurred as an accident due to unusual circumstances, it might be that she had decided to put the matter out of her mind. It was ascribing to her a power of thought and a mature wisdom which fitted neither with her age nor with her character. But he realised that he knew nothing of her. There had been in her always something enigmatic.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的态度和平日没有丁点不同。菲利普本以为会有些隐晦或突然的变化。他想象她面对自己时会觉得羞耻、愤怒，或者表现得比过去更加亲密；然而，什么都没有发生，她仍和过去一模一样。一群人说说笑笑往海边走，萨莉一言不发，像往日一样含蓄温柔，菲利普也只见过她这幅样子。她既不主动和他说话，也不会故意不理他。这让菲利普震惊了。他原以为昨晚的事会让萨莉有天翻地覆的转变，却发现那件事似乎只是自己的一个梦，从未真实地发生过。他往前走着，一只手领了个小姑娘，另一只拉住个小男孩，装作若无其事地大声谈笑，心里却暗暗琢磨萨莉究竟是怎么一回事。也许她也像自己一样，觉得这事儿只是发生在特殊场合下的一时冲动，又或者，她已经决定把它抛到脑后。萨莉的思考能力和成熟的智慧都与其年龄、性格不符，也许正因为此，她才会如此淡定。菲利普这才意识到，原来自己一直不了解萨莉。在她身上，永远有些让人捉摸不透的东西。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then he remembered what had happened. His heart sank, and, half out of bed already, he stopped; he did not know how he was going to face her; he was overwhelmed with a sudden rush of self-reproach, and bitterly, bitterly, he regretted what he had done. What would she say to him that morning? He dreaded meeting her, and he asked himself how he could have been such a fool. But the children gave him no time; Edward took his bathing-drawers and his towel, Athelstan tore the bed-clothes away; and in three minutes they all clattered down into the road. Sally gave him a smile. It was as sweet and innocent as it had ever been.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普一个激灵，想到昨晚发生的事，他的心一下沉入谷底，呆呆地坐在床上，不知道该怎么面对萨莉，心里自责极了。他后悔自己昨晚的行为，悔得肠子都要青了。该和萨莉说点什么呢？他甚至不敢见她，觉得自己就是个彻头彻尾的大傻子。孩子们可看不出他心里的纠结，爱德华把他的衬衣、衬裤拿过来，阿西尔斯坦扯开他的被子，不出三分钟这群嘻嘻哈哈的孩子就推搡着他下楼了。萨莉看到他，轻轻一笑，像往日一样恬静、纯洁。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They played leap-frog in the water, and the bathe was as uproarious as on the previous day. Sally mothered them all, keeping a watchful eye on them, and calling to them when they went out too far. She swam staidly backwards and forwards while the others got up to their larks, and now and then turned on her back to float. Presently she went out and began drying herself; she called to the others more or less peremptorily, and at last only Philip was left in the water. He took the opportunity to have a good hard swim. He was more used to the cold water this second morning, and he revelled in its salt freshness; it rejoiced him to use his limbs freely, and he covered the water with long, firm strokes. But Sally, with a towel round her, went down to the water's edge.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们在海里玩着青蛙跳的游戏，跟昨天一样闹声喧天。萨利像母亲一样照顾着所有孩子，有谁游得太远了，她就负责把他们叫回来。孩子欢快地扑腾着水，她就静静地来回游了两圈，不时仰面在水上漂浮一会儿。不久之后，她上岸擦干身子，带着命令的口吻，让剩下的小孩赶快上来穿衣服。最后，水里只剩菲利普一个人了。他抓紧机会赶快痛快地游了两趟。他现在已经比前一天更适应这凉凉的海水了，带着盐味的清新气息让人非常愉快。他自由自在地伸展四肢，使劲儿划着水。萨莉围着一条毛巾走到水边来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She had never talked to him in that manner before. It was as though what had happened gave her a sort of right over him, and she looked upon him as a child to be cared for. In a few minutes they were dressed, and they started to walk back. Sally noticed his hands.</div>

<div class="line_en">She took his hands in hers and rubbed them, first one and then the other, till the colour returned. Philip, touched and puzzled, watched her. He could not say anything to her on account of the children, and he did not meet her eyes; but he was sure they did not avoid his purposely, it just happened that they did not meet. And during the day there was nothing in her behaviour to suggest a consciousness in her that anything had passed between them. Perhaps she was a little more talkative than usual. When they were all sitting again in the hop-field she told her mother how naughty Philip had been in not coming out of the water till he was blue with cold. It was incredible, and yet it seemed that the only effect of the incident of the night before was to arouse in her a feeling of protection towards him: she had the same instinctive desire to mother him as she had with regard to her brothers and sisters.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她拉过菲利普的手，轻轻搓着，先是一只，再是另一只，直到两只手都恢复了血色。菲利普大为感动，又困惑不解，好奇地看着她。孩子就在身边，他不好说些什么。萨莉的眼睛一直低垂着，他捕捉不到她的目光，可心里清楚她只是在专心致志地给自己暖手罢了。整整一天的时间，她都没再表现出任何异样，好像没有意识到她和菲利普之间发生了什么。可能她比平时更健谈一点吧。坐在啤酒花田里，她给母亲讲起菲利普早上有多么淘气，在海里冻得浑身发青还不肯出来。她的表现让人难以置信，仿佛昨晚那件事产生的唯一影响就是激发了她对菲利普的保护欲。她本能地如母亲一般照顾着他，就像照顾其他弟弟妹妹。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was not till the evening that he found himself alone with her. She was cooking the supper, and Philip was sitting on the grass by the side of the fire. Mrs. Athelny had gone down to the village to do some shopping, and the children were scattered in various pursuits of their own. Philip hesitated to speak. He was very nervous. Sally attended to her business with serene competence and she accepted placidly the silence which to him was so embarrassing. He did not know how to begin. Sally seldom spoke unless she was spoken to or had something particular to say. At last he could not bear it any longer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="直到傍晚，菲利普才找着机会和她单独待上一会儿。她正忙着做晚饭，菲利普则坐在篝火边的草地上。阿西尔尼夫人去镇上买东西了，其他孩子四处乱跑，各玩各的。菲利普犹犹豫豫，不知如何开口。他心里非常忐忑。萨莉熟练地做着家务，对使菲利普焦躁难安的沉默淡然处之。他想打破这种沉默，可萨莉除了说正事外，几乎从不主动开口。最后，他终于忍不下去了，脱口而出：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He waited under the stars, sitting on the stile, and the hedges with their ripening blackberries were high on each side of him. From the earth rose rich scents of the night, and the air was soft and still. His heart was beating madly. He could not understand anything of what happened to him. He associated passion with cries and tears and vehemence, and there was nothing of this in Sally; but he did not know what else but passion could have caused her to give herself. But passion for him? He would not have been surprised if she had fallen to her cousin, Peter Gann, tall, spare, and straight, with his sunburned face and long, easy stride. Philip wondered what she saw in him. He did not know if she loved him as he reckoned love. And yet? He was convinced of her purity. He had a vague inkling that many things had combined, things that she felt though was unconscious of, the intoxication of the air and the hops and the night, the healthy instincts of the natural woman, a tenderness that overflowed, and an affection that had in it something maternal and something sisterly; and she gave all she had to give because her heart was full of charity.</div>

Her arm, strong and muscular, was bare to the elbow; he passed his hand over it and wondered at its beauty; it gleamed in the darkness; she had the skin that Rubens painted, astonishingly fair and transparent, and on one side were little golden hairs. It was the arm of a Saxon goddess; but no immortal had that exquisite, homely naturalness; and Philip thought of a cottage garden with the dear flowers which bloom in all men's hearts, of the hollyhock and the red and white rose which is called York and Lancaster, and of love -- in-a-mist and Sweet William, and honeysuckle, larkspur, and London Pride.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他让萨莉阖上眼睛，轻轻吻着她的眼皮。先是一只眼，再是另一只。她的胳膊强壮而结实，从手腕一直裸露到手肘。他轻轻抚摸着她的皮肤，感受那带有温度的美丽。她就像鲁本斯画里的女人，每一寸肌肤在月光下都泛着光辉，白皙透明得叫人不敢相信，手臂外侧长着细细的金色绒毛，如同撒克逊女神的玉臂。凡人怎会有这样精致而平凡的美好呢？菲利普想，所有男人心中都有一座乡间小舍，鲜花怒放，美不胜收：有蜀葵，有叫作兰卡斯特和约克的红白双色玫瑰，有黑种草、石竹、忍冬、飞燕草，还有虎耳草。">查看中文翻译</div>
