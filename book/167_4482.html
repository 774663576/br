<div class="line_en">"Lord Stannis wants to smoke out the Imp's savages." Dontos swayed as he spoke, one hand on the trunk of a chestnut tree. A wine stain discolored the red-and-yellow motley of his tunic. "They kill his scouts and raid his baggage train. And the wildlings have been lighting fires too. The Imp told the queen that Stannis had better train his horses to eat ash, since he would find no blade of grass. I heard him say so. I hear all sorts of things as a fool that I never heard when I was a knight. They talk as though I am not there, and -- he leaned close, breathing his winey breath right in her face --"the Spider pays in gold for any little trifle. I think Moon Boy has been his for years."</div>

<div class="line_en">The southern sky was black with smoke. It rose swirling off a hundred distant fires, its sooty fingers smudging out the stars. Across the Blackwater Rush, a line of flame burned nightly from horizon to horizon, while on this side the Imp had fired the whole riverfront: docks and warehouses, homes and brothels, everything outside the city walls.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="唐托斯点头。“他将树木积成一个巨大的柴堆，奉献给他的新神，红袍女祭司要他这么做的。听说他现在灵肉都归她驱使，甚至发誓一但夺取君临，便要焚毁贝勒大圣堂呢！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was true. The Blackwater Rush was as empty as Sansa had ever seen it. All the ferries had been withdrawn to the north bank, and the trading galleys had fled or been seized by the Imp to be made over for battle. The only ships to be seen were the king's war galleys. They rowed endlessly up and down, staying to the deep water in the middle of the river and exchanging flights of arrows with Stannis's archers on the south shore.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是事实。如今黑水河比以往任何时候都空旷。所有渡船都撤到北岸，而商船要么逃走，要么被小恶魔扣留，用于作战。放眼望去，唯一的船是国王的战舰。它们不断来回穿梭，保持在河中央的深水区，与南岸史坦尼斯的弓手飞箭往来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Child, child." Dontos shook his head. "Out of the castle, yes, we could do that, but the city gates are more heavily guarded than ever, and the Imp has even closed off the river."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“孩子呀，孩子。”唐托斯摇摇头。“溜出红堡很简单，我们能做到。但每道城门都戒备森严，何况小恶魔还封锁了河道。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Lord Stannis himself was still on the march, but his vanguard had appeared two nights ago during the black of the moon. King's Landing had woken to the sight of their tents and banners. They were five thousand, Sansa had heard, near as many as all the gold cloaks in the city. They flew the red or green apples of House Fossoway, the turtle of Estermont, and the fox-andflowers of Florent, and their commander was Ser Guyard Morrigen, a famous southron knight who men now called Guyard the Green. His standard showed a crow in flight, its black wings spread wide against a storm-green sky. But it was the pale yellow banners that worried the city. Long ragged tails streamed behind them like flickering flames, and in place of a lord's sigil they bore the device of a god: the burning heart of the Lord of Light.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="史坦尼斯公爵本人还在行军，但他的先锋部队已于两天前趁一个月黑风高的晚上先行抵达。早上醒来，全君临都看到了他们的帐篷与旗帜。珊莎听说他们有五千人之多，几乎相当于城里金袍卫士的总数。敌人营地里飘扬着佛索威家族的青苹果旗和红苹果旗，伊斯蒙家族的海龟旗以及佛罗伦家族的狐狸鲜花旗，他们的指挥官是古德·莫里根爵士，一个著名的南方骑士，从前是蓝礼的绿衣卫。他的旗帜乃是一只飞鸦，在风雨欲来的碧绿天空中大展黑翅。但最令整个城市揪心的还是那些淡黄的旗，长长的旗穗拖在后面，如火焰一样摇曳，原本该是家族纹章的地方放着神的标记：光之王的烈焰红心。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The time is right now," Sansa insisted, "before the fighting starts. They've forgotten about me. I know we could slip away if we tried."</div>

<div class="line_en">Sansa dug her nails into her hand. She could feel the fear in her tummy, twisting and pinching, worse every day. Nightmares of the day Princess Myrcella had sailed still troubled her sleep; dark suffocating dreams that woke her in the black of night, struggling for breath. She could hear the people screaming at her, screaming without words, like animals. They had hemmed her in and thrown filth at her and tried to pull her off her horse, and would have done worse if the Hound had not cut his way to her side. They had torn the High Septon to pieces and smashed in Ser Aron's head with a rock. Try not to be afraid! he said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="珊莎的指甲深深掐进掌心，肚子里则有恐惧绞动抽搐，一天比一天强烈。弥赛菈公主离去那天的经历一直在梦中纠缠不休，梦魇黑暗而令人窒息，令她每每在深晚惊醒，拼命喘气。群众的尖叫萦绕耳际，不成词句，活像动物的嘶喊。他们把她团团围住，各种东西朝她扔来，还想将她拉下马，若不是猎狗杀开一条血路来救她，后果不堪设想。想想看，他们将总主教撕成碎片，用石头砸扁了艾伦爵士的头。您不要怕！他居然要我别害怕！">查看中文翻译</div>

Perhaps the good gods will send a storm to sweep them from the seas." Dontos gave a hopeful smile. "It is not easy for you, I know. You must be patient, child. When my friend returns to the city, we shall have our ship. Have faith in your Florian, and try not to be afraid."</div>

Dontos covered his mouth to stifle a burp. "Gods preserve you, my little Jonquil." He was growing weepy. The wine did that to him. "Give your Florian a little kiss now. A kiss for luck." He swayed toward her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他们这样想就好，亲爱的，这样您更安全。瑟曦太后，小恶魔以及瓦里斯这些人当彼此是毒蛇猛兽，像老鹰一样互相盯得紧紧的，到处花钱雇人探听消息，但坦妲伯爵夫人的女儿就没人劳神关心，对不对？”唐托斯捂住嘴巴，打了个嗝。“诸神保佑您，我的小琼琪。”他的泪水涌上来，是酒的缘故。“快给您的佛罗理安一个小小的吻吧。一个幸运之吻。”他摇摇晃晃地向她靠近。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The whole city was afraid. Sansa could see it from the castle walls. The smallfolk were hiding themselves behind closed shutters and barred doors as if that would keep them safe. The last time King's Landing had fallen, the Lannisters looted and raped as they pleased and put hundreds to the sword, even though the city had opened its gates. This time the Imp meant to fight, and a city that fought could expect no mercy at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其实全城都陷入了恐慌。珊莎在城堡围墙上看到，老百姓们统统关闭窗户，上好门闩，似乎这样就能保住性命。上次君临城陷，兰尼斯特家肆意奸淫掳掠，带走几百条人命，那一次还是开城投降的。而今小恶魔意图抵抗，城破之后的下场可想而知。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She crossed over the dry moat with its cruel iron spikes and made her way up the narrow turnpike stair, but when she reached the door of her bedchamber she could not bear to enter. The very walls of the room made her feel trapped; even with the window opened wide it felt as though there were no air to breathe.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她穿过布满尖锐铁刺的干涸护城河，走上狭窄的高架楼梯，当到达卧房门口时，居然不想进去。房间的墙壁让她窒息，明知里面窗户大开，她仍然感觉空气稀薄。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The drawbridge to Maegor's Holdfast was unguarded. The imp had moved most of the gold cloaks to the city walls, and the white knights of the Kingsguard had duties more important than dogging her heels. Sansa could go where she would so long as she did not try to leave the castle, but there was nowhere she wanted to go.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="梅葛楼的吊桥无人看守。小恶魔将大部分金袍卫士调去守城，而白袍的御林铁卫们而今也忙得不可开交，无暇步步尾随她。只要别离开城堡，珊莎想去哪儿就可以去哪儿，但她哪儿也不想去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Turning back to the stair, Sansa climbed. The smoke blotted out the stars and the thin crescent of moon, so the roof was dark and thick with shadows. Yet from here she could see everything: the Red Keep's tall towers and great cornerforts, the maze of city streets beyond, to south and west the river running black, the bay to the east, the columns of smoke and cinders, and fires, fires everywhere. Soldiers crawled over the city walls like ants with torches, and crowded the hoardings that had sprouted from the ramparts. Down by the Mud Gate, outlined against the drifting smoke, she could make out the vague shape of the three huge catapults, the biggest anyone had ever seen, overtopping the walls by a good twenty feet. Yet none of it made her feel less fearful. A stab went through her, so sharp that Sansa sobbed and clutched at her belly. She might have fallen, but a shadow moved suddenly, and strong fingers grabbed her arm and steadied her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是珊莎转回楼梯，继续攀登。浓烟遮掩了群星和一轮纤细的新月，堡顶黑呼呼的，满是阴影。但从这儿看出去，全城尽在眼帘：红堡高耸的塔楼和巨大的角堡，下方如迷宫般的城市街道，西面南面是奔流的黑水，东面则是海湾，以及一丛丛烟柱和灰烬，火，到处都是火。近处，士兵擎着火炬，像蚂蚁一样爬满城墙和从城垛延伸出的塔楼。烂泥门下，飘荡的烟尘中依稀可辨三座投石机的轮廓，这是前所未有的巨型投石机，高过城墙足足二十尺。但这一切都不能减轻她的恐惧。一阵尖利的刺痛突然袭来，珊莎紧捂肚子，眼泪夺眶而出。她差点摔下去，幸亏一个影子突然闪出，用强有力的手紧扣她的胳膊，将她稳住。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sansa dodged the wet groping lips, kissed him lightly on an unshaven cheek, and bid him good night. It took all her strength not to weep. She had been weeping too much of late. It was unseemly, she knew, but she could not seem to help herself; the tears would come, sometimes over a trifle, and nothing she did could hold them back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="珊莎避开他探出的湿润双唇，轻轻吻在他胡子拉碴的脸颊上，并跟他道晚安，竭尽全力才没有哭泣。最近她哭得太多。这样很不体面，她知道，但就是控制不住。有时为了一些琐事，眼泪便掉下来，怎么都收不住。">查看中文翻译</div>

The man with the garlicky breath was on the ground, blood pumping out the stump of his arm, but there were others all around, some with clubs in hand. The Hound leapt at them, his sword a blur of steel that trailed a red mist as it swung. When they broke and ran before him he had laughed, his terrible burned face for a moment transformed.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Just as if I was one of those true knights you love so well, yes. What do you think a knight is for, girl? You think it's all taking favors from ladies and looking fine in gold plate? Knights are for killing." He laid the edge of his longsword against her neck, just under her ear. Sansa could feel the sharpness of the steel. "I killed my first man at twelve. I've lost count of how many I've killed since then. High lords with old names, fat rich men dressed in velvet, knights puffed up like bladders with their honors, yes, and women and children too -- they're all meat, and I'm the butcher. Let them have their lands and their gods and their gold. Let them have their sers." Sandor Clegane spat at her feet to show what he thought of that.

Everywhere she turned she saw faces twisted into monstrous inhuman masks. She wept and told them she had never done them hurt, yet they dragged her from her horse all the same. "No," she cried, "no, please, don't, don't," but no one paid her any heed. She shouted for Ser Dontos, for her brothers, for her dead father and her dead wolf, for gallant Ser Loras who had given her a red rose once, but none of them came. She called for the heroes from the songs, for Florian and Ser Ryam Redwyne and Prince Aemon the Dragonknight, but no one heard. Women swarmed over her like weasels, pinching her legs and kicking her in the belly, and someone hit her in the face and she felt her teeth shatter. Then she saw the bright glimmer of steel.

<div class="line_en">When she woke, the pale light of morning was slanting through her window, yet she felt as sick and achy as if she had not slept at all. There was something sticky on her thighs. When she threw back the blanket and saw the blood, all she could think was that her dream had somehow come true. She remembered the knives inside her, twisting and ripping.

She pulled the torn sheet from the bed, and the stained blanket as well. I'll have to burn them. She balled up the evidence, stuffed it in the fireplace, drenched it in oil from her bedside lamp, and lit it afire. Then she realized that the blood had soaked through the sheet into the featherbed, so she bundled that up as well, but it was big and cumbersome, hard to move. Sansa could get only half of it into the fire.

<div class="line_en">When the fire was out, they carried off the singed featherbed, fanned away the worst of the smoke, and brought up a tub. Women came and went, muttering and looking at her strangely. They filled the tub with scalding hot water, bathed her and washed her hair and gave her a cloth to wear between her legs. By then Sansa was calm again, and ashamed for her folly. The smoke had ruined most of her clothing. One of the women went away and came back with a green wool shift that was almost her size. "It's not as pretty as your own things, but it will serve," she announced when she'd pulled it down over Sansa's head.
