<div class="line_en">When the hops were picked, Philip with the news in his pocket that he had got the appointment as assistant house-physician at St. Luke's, accompanied the Athelnys back to London. He took modest rooms in Westminster and at the beginning of October entered upon his duties. The work was interesting and varied; every day he learned something new; he felt himself of some consequence; and he saw a good deal of Sally. He found life uncommonly pleasant. He was free about six, except on the days on which he had out-patients, and then he went to the shop at which Sally worked to meet her when she came out. There were several young men, who hung about opposite the `trade entrance' or a little further along, at the first corner; and the girls, coming out two and two or in little groups, nudged one another and giggled as they recognised them. Sally in her plain black dress looked very different from the country lass who had picked hops side by side with him. She walked away from the shop quickly, but she slackened her pace when they met, and greeted him with her quiet smile. They walked together through the busy street. He talked to her of his work at the hospital, and she told him what she had been doing in the shop that day. He came to know the names of the girls she worked with. He found that Sally had a restrained, but keen, sense of the ridiculous, and she made remarks about the girls or the men who were set over them which amused him by their unexpected drollery. She had a way of saying a thing which was very characteristic, quite gravely, as though there were nothing funny in it at all, and yet it was so sharp-sighted that Philip broke into delighted laughter. Then she would give him a little glance in which the smiling eyes showed she was not unaware of her own humour. They met with a handshake and parted as formally. Once Philip asked her to come and have tea with him in his rooms, but she refused.</div>

<div class="line_en">Never a word of love passed between them. She seemed not to desire anything more than the companionship of those walks. Yet Philip was positive that she was glad to be with him. She puzzled him as much as she had done at the beginning.

<div class="line_en">He walked away with a tumult of thoughts in his head. What a fool he had been! That was the first thing that struck him, an abject, miserable fool, and he repeated it to himself a dozen times in a rush of angry feeling. He despised himself. How could he have got into such a mess? But at the same time, for his thoughts chased one another through his brain and yet seemed to stand together, in a hopeless confusion, like the pieces of a jig-saw puzzle seen in a nightmare, he asked himself what he was going to do. Everything was so clear before him, all he had aimed at so long within reach at last, and now his inconceivable stupidity had erected this new obstacle. Philip had never been able to surmount what he acknowledged was a defect in his resolute desire for a well ordered life, and that was his passion for living in the future; and no sooner was he settled in his work at the hospital than he had busied himself with arrangements for his travels. In the past he had often tried not to think too circumstantially of his plans for the future, it was only discouraging; but now that his goal was so near he saw no harm in giving away to a longing that was so difficult to resist. First of all he meant to go to Spain. That was the land of his heart; and by now he was imbued with its spirit, its romance and colour and history and grandeur; he felt that it had a message for him in particular which no other country could give. He knew the fine old cities already as though he had trodden their tortuous streets from childhood. Cordova, Seville, Toledo, Leon, Tarragona, Burgos. The great painters of Spain were the painters of his soul, and his pulse beat quickly as he pictured his ecstasy on standing face to face with those works which were more significant than any others to his own tortured, restless heart. He had read the great poets, more characteristic of their race than the poets of other lands; for they seemed to have drawn their inspiration not at all from the general currents of the world's literature but directly from the torrid, scented plains and the bleak mountains of their country. A few short months now, and he would hear with his own ears all around him the language which seemed most apt for grandeur of soul and passion. His fine taste had given him an inkling that Andalusia was too soft and sensuous, a little vulgar even, to satisfy his ardour; and his imagination dwelt more willingly among the wind-swept distances of Castile and the rugged magnificence of Aragon and Leon. He did not know quite what those unknown contacts would give him, but he felt that he would gather from them a strength and a purpose which would make him more capable of affronting and comprehending the manifold wonders of places more distant and more strange.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲利普转身离开，心里如一团乱麻。他第一点想到的是：自己真是傻瓜，一个又可怜又可恨的大傻瓜！他怒气冲冲地把自己骂了十几遍。怎么能惹出这样一摊麻烦来呢？与此同时，他脑子里一个接一个不断冒出的想法如同噩梦中所见的乱七八糟的拼图画块，让人完全理不出头绪。他问自己该怎么做。他终于等到这样一天的来临：未来一片明朗，梦想唾手可得，可就在这个节骨眼上，他那难以置信的愚蠢又给自己隔上了一堵墙。他总是不能沉下心来安稳地过日子，究其原因，有一条是他无法反驳的：他总是对未来怀有热忱的渴望。刚刚才得到医院的任职，他就开始忙着安排自己的旅行了。过去，他一再阻止自己对未来做出过细的打算，那只会让人士气大失。可现在离目标只有咫尺之距，他也就允许自己向那难以抗拒的欲望做出妥协。首先，他想去西班牙，那是他心里最神圣的一方土地。此时，他的身体已经融入它的精魂，它的浪漫与色彩、历史与恢弘。众多国家中，似乎只有那里对他发出召唤。哥多华、塞维利亚、托莱多、利昂、塔拉戈纳、布尔戈斯——他对那里古老优雅的老城非常熟悉，就像一个土生土长的西班牙人，从小就穿梭在那蜿蜒曲折的小巷中。西班牙的伟大画家是他最为敬仰的灵魂画师，没有别的任何一幅画能像他们的作品给菲利普饱受折磨、焦躁难安的心灵带来教诲和抚慰，每当想象自己面对面地站在这些画作前，菲利普就感到一阵狂喜。他拜读过西班牙诗人的著作，诗行间体现出的鲜明民族特色在其他任何土地都见所未见。他们没有跟着世界文学的潮流亦步亦趋，而是从故乡炎热、芬芳的平原和荒凉灰暗的山丘中攫取灵感。还有短短几个月，他就能置身异域，亲耳听到身边人说着那最具灵魂与激情光辉的语言。他品味上佳、眼光独特。对他来说，安达卢西亚似乎太柔弱多情，甚至有些俗气。他的想象更爱驰骋在风沙凛冽的卡斯提尔或畅游于粗犷宏伟的亚拉贡、利昂。这些尚未体验过的经历会带来些什么他还无从知晓，但他觉得一定能在其中获取力量、找到目标，从而向更遥远、更陌生的目的地前进，去迎接、去参悟这世上的种种神奇。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For this was only a beginning. He had got into communication with the various companies which took surgeons out on their ships, and knew exactly what were their routes, and from men who had been on them what were the advantages and disadvantages of each line. He put aside the Orient and the P. &amp; O. It was difficult to get a berth with them; and besides their passenger traffic allowed the medical officer little freedom; but there were other services which sent large tramps on leisurely expeditions to the East, stopping at all sorts of ports for various periods, from a day or two to a fortnight, so that you had plenty of time, and it was often possible to make a trip inland. The pay was poor and the food no more than adequate, so that there was not much demand for the posts, and a man with a London degree was pretty sure to get one if he applied. Since there were no passengers other than a casual man or so, shipping on business from some out-of-the-way port to another, the life on board was friendly and pleasant. Philip knew by heart the list of places at which they touched; and each one called up in him visions of tropical sunshine, and magic colour, and of a teeming, mysterious, intense life. Life! That was what he wanted. At last he would come to close quarters with Life. And perhaps, from Tokyo or Shanghai it would be possible to tranship into some other line and drip down to the islands of the South Pacific. A doctor was useful anywhere. There might be an opportunity to go up country in Burmah, and what rich jungles in Sumatra or Borneo might he not visit? He was young still and time was no object to him. He had no ties in England, no friends; he could go up and down the world for years, learning the beauty and the wonder and the variedness of life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这还仅仅只是个开始。他已经和很多聘用随船医生的轮船公司有过联系，对他们的远洋航线也耳熟能详，甚至还跟之前船上的大夫打听过每条航线的优势劣势。他放弃了东方轮船和铁行轮船，因为这两个公司的职位太紧俏，而且他们的主要业务是客员运输，这样一来，随船医务人员几乎没有什么自由可言。其他公司会派大型的不定期商船前往东方，航行安排也不算紧凑，在每个港口逗留的时间从一两天到半个月不等，大可以趁此机会到内陆去游玩一圈。这种职位薪水微薄，伙食糟糕，所以公司对应聘者也没有过多的要求，若是一个在伦敦学医的人申请应聘，绝对是十拿九稳的。商船除了偶尔载几个人之外便没有其他旅客了，再加上它为了运输货物，一般都是在偏僻的小港口间来回航行，所以船上的生活非常愉快舒适。菲利普把商船停靠的港口地背得滚瓜烂熟，每个名字都能让他想起明媚温暖的热带阳光、五彩斑斓的异域景色和充实、神秘、热闹的生活。生活啊，这就是他想要的！历经千辛万苦，他终于离真正的生活越来越近。也许某次在从东京或上海起航后，他可以中途换船，一路航行到那宛若世外桃源一般的南太平洋小岛上。反正哪里都需要医生嘛。说不定有机会去缅甸乡下走一遭，谁知道在苏门答腊或婆罗洲会与怎样的丛林美景不期而遇呢？菲利普年纪尚轻，时间于他并不是什么问题。他在英国没有亲戚朋友，可以花上几年的时间去世界各地走一走，见识大千世界中的的美景奇观。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Now this thing had come. He put aside the possibility that Sally was mistaken; he felt strangely certain that she was right; after all, it was so likely; anyone could see that Nature had built her to be the mother of children. He knew what he ought to do. He ought not to let the incident divert him a hair's breadth from his path. He thought of Griffiths; he could easily imagine with what indifference that young man would have received such a piece of news; he would have thought it an awful nuisance and would at once have taken to his heels, like a wise fellow; he would have left the girl to deal with her troubles as best she could. Philip told himself that if this had happened it was because it was inevitable. He was no more to blame than Sally; she was a girl who knew the world and the facts of life, and she had taken the risk with her eyes open. It would be madness to allow such an accident to disturb the whole pattern of his life. He was one of the few people who was acutely conscious of the transitoriness of life, and how necessary it was to make the most of it. He would do what he could for Sally; he could afford to give her a sufficient sum of money. A strong man would never allow himself to be turned from his purpose.</div>

<div class="line_en">She had trusted him and been kind to him. He simply could not do a thing which, notwithstanding all his reason, he felt was horrible. He knew he would have no peace on his travels if he had the thought constantly with him that she was wretched. Besides, there were her father and mother: they had always treated him well; it was not possible to repay them with ingratitude. The only thing was to marry Sally as quickly as possible. He would write to Doctor South, tell him he was going to be married at once, and say that if his offer still held he was willing to accept it. That sort of practice, among poor people, was the only one possible for him; there his deformity did not matter, and they would not sneer at the simple manners of his wife. It was curious to think of her as his wife, it gave him a queer, soft feeling; and a wave of emotion spread over him as he thought of the child which was his. He had little doubt that Doctor South would be glad to have him, and he pictured to himself the life he would lead with Sally in the fishing village. They would have a little house within sight of the sea, and he would watch the mighty ships passing to the lands he would never know. Perhaps that was the wisest thing. Cronshaw had told him that the facts of life mattered nothing to him who by the power of fancy held in fee the twin realms of space and time. It was true. Forever wilt thou love and she be fair!</div>

<div class="line_en">His wedding present to his wife would be all his high hopes. Self-sacrifice! Philip was uplifted by its beauty, and all through the evening he thought of it. He was so excited that he could not read. He seemed to be driven out of his rooms into the streets, and he walked up and down Birdcage Walk, his heart throbbing with joy. He could hardly bear his impatience. He wanted to see Sally's happiness when he made her his offer, and if it had not been so late he would have gone to her there and then. He pictured to himself the long evenings he would spend with Sally in the cosy sitting-room, the blinds undrawn so that they could watch the sea; he with his books, while she bent over her work, and the shaded lamp made her sweet face more fair. They would talk over the growing child, and when she turned her eyes to his there was in them the light of love. And the fishermen and their wives who were his patients would come to feel a great affection for them, and they in their turn would enter into the pleasures and pains of those simple lives. But his thoughts returned to the son who would be his and hers. Already he felt in himself a passionate devotion to it. He thought of passing his hands over his little perfect limbs, he knew he would be beautiful; and he would make over to him all his dreams of a rich and varied life. And thinking over the long pilgrimage of his past he accepted it joyfully. He accepted the deformity which had made life so hard for him; he knew that it had warped his character, but now he saw also that by reason of it he had acquired that power of introspection which had given him so much delight. Without it he would never have had his keen appreciation of beauty, his passion for art and literature, and his interest in the varied spectacle of life. The ridicule and the contempt which had so often been heaped upon him had turned his mind inward and called forth those flowers which he felt would never lose their fragrance. Then he saw that the normal was the rarest thing in the world. Everyone had some defect, of body or of mind: he thought of all the people he had known (the whole world was like a sick-house, and there was no rhyme or reason in it), he saw a long procession, deformed in body and warped in mind, some with illness of the flesh, weak hearts or weak lungs, and some with illness of the spirit, languor of will, or a craving for liquor. At this moment he could feel a holy compassion for them all. They were the helpless instruments of blind chance. He could pardon Griffiths for his treachery and Mildred for the pain she had caused him. They could not help themselves. The only reasonable thing was to accept the good of men and be patient with their faults. The words of the dying God crossed his memory:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他准备放弃所有的远大理想，将自我牺牲作为献给新婚妻子的最好礼物。这是多么美妙的事啊，他整整想了一夜，激动得看不下去书。一种无形的力量把他拽出屋子，推到了大街上。他沿着伯德卡基的人行道信步往返，心脏兴奋而剧烈地跳动着。他一刻也不想等待下去了，恨不能立刻就去找萨莉说出他的决定，迫不及待地想看到萨莉幸福的样子。如果不是时候太晚，他可能现在已经站在萨莉家的大门外了。他想象着和她依偎在一间舒适惬意的客厅，百叶窗敞开着，波光粼粼的大海就在眼前。他看书时，她就在一旁静静忙碌；那可爱的面庞在灯罩下倾泻出的暗暗光亮中多了几分迷人的滋味。他们谈着那即将出生的小宝宝，眼神时而相遇，便能看出她的眸子里烁着爱的光辉。前来问诊的渔夫和妻子都很喜欢他们，而他们也愿意与这些病人苦乐共享。他又想到萨莉肚子里的孩子。他似乎已经爱上了这个素未谋面的小家伙。这个孩子会长得很漂亮，他要爱怜地摸摸那小手小脚，要把自己壮丽多彩的人生梦想统统转交给他。回想曾经那段漫长的朝圣之旅，他竟忽然得以释怀。他坦然接受了自己的残疾，尽管正是因为它，生活才变得如此艰辛。这只瘸腿让他的性格扭曲，可也赋予他内省的能力，让他能因此而自得其乐。倘若他的肢体是健全的，也许就不会对美有如此独到的鉴赏力，不会这样热烈地崇尚艺术和文学，也不会因生命百态而兴致勃勃。在他身上日积月累的讥讽嘲笑让他渐渐筑起心墙，催开了芳香不逝的花朵。他看到，在这世上，最为珍贵是寻常。人人生来便带着瑕疵，或是身体，或是灵魂。他想到自己认识的所有的人（世界可比作一间病房，混乱无序，毫无逻辑可言），排成长长一队，肢体残缺，心灵扭曲；肉体的疾病如心脏绞痛、肺部脓肿，精神的异常如意志匮乏、嗜酒成命。此刻，他想到这些人，心中升起神圣而深沉的同情。他们是遭到命运玩弄的可怜人儿。他原谅了格里菲斯的背叛，原谅了米尔德里德的铁石心肠。他们对自己的行为也是无能为力啊。唯一合理的做法只有接受人心之善，宽容人性之恶。菲利普忽然想起耶稣在临终之际的那句教诲：">查看中文翻译</div>
