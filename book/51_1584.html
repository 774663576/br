<div class="line_en">The impact with the hard-packed earth of the plain knocks the wind out of me. My backpack does little to soften the blow. Fortunately my quiver has caught in the crook of my elbow, sparing both itself and my shoulder, and my bow is locked in my grasp. The ground still shakes with explosions. I can't hear them. I can't hear anything at the moment. But the apples must have set off enough mines, causing debris to activate the others. I manage to shield my face with my arms as shattered bits of matter, some of it burning, rain down around me. An acrid smoke fills the air, which is not the best remedy for someone trying to regain the ability to breathe.</div>

<div class="line_en">I'd better get out of here, I think. They'll be making a beeline for the place. But once I'm on my feet, I realize escape may not be so simple. I'm dizzy. Not the slightly wobbly kind, but the kind that sends the trees swooping around you and causes the earth to move in waves under your feet. I take a few steps and somehow wind up on my hands and knees. I wait a few minutes to let it pass, but it doesn't.</div>

<div class="line_en">No blood trails, I tell myself, and manage to pull my hood up over my head, tie the cord under my chin with uncooperative fingers. That should help soak up the blood. I can't walk, but can I crawl? I move forward tentatively. Yes, if I go very slowly, I can crawl. Most of the woods will offer insufficient cover. My only hope is to make it back to Rue's copse and conceal myself in greenery. I can't get caught out here on my hands and knees in the open. Not only will I face death, it's sure to be a long and painful one at Cato's hand. The thought of Prim having to watch that keeps me doggedly inching my way toward the hideout.</div>

<div class="line_en">Panic begins to set in. I can't stay here. Flight is essential. But I can neither walk nor hear. I place a hand to my left ear, the one that was turned toward the blast, and it comes away bloody. Have I gone deaf from the explosion? The idea frightens me. I rely as much on my ears as my eyes as a hunter, maybe more at times. But I can't let my fear show. Absolutely, positively, I am live on every screen in Panem.</div>

<div class="line_en">To say I make it in the nick of time is an understatement. I have literally just dragged myself into the tangle of bushes at the base of the trees when there's Cato, barreling onto the plain, soon followed by his companions. His rage is so extreme it might be comical -- so people really do tear out their hair and beat the ground with their fists -- if I didn't know that it was aimed at me, at what I have done to him. Add to that my proximity, my inability to run or defend myself, and in fact, the whole thing has me terrified. I'm glad my hiding place makes it impossible for the cameras to get a close shot of me because I'm biting my nails like there's no tomorrow. Gnawing off the last bits of nail polish, trying to keep my teeth from chattering.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果仅仅说我及时逃走了，那就太轻描淡写了，几乎就在我爬进灌木丛的同时，加图从林子里猛地蹿出来，后面跟着他的同伙。他气愤至极，简直好笑——原来人在着急时，真的会手抓头发，拳头捶地。要是我并不知道他这么做是冲我来的，是因我的所作所为而大为光火就好了。我距离他们这么近，不能跑，又无力自卫，事实上，这所有的一切都令我恐惧。我很庆幸摄像机在我的藏身之处照不到近景，因为我正疯狂地咬指甲，同时这么做也是为了不让自己的牙齿打颤。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="一瞬间，三区的男孩没了命。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Cato has finished the first phase of his tantrum and takes out his anger on the smoking remains by kicking open various containers. The other tributes are poking around in the mess, looking for anything to salvage, but there's nothing. The boy from District 3 has done his job too well. This idea must occur to Cato, too, because he turns on the boy and appears to be shouting at him. The boy from District 3 only has time to turn and run before Cato catches him in a headlock from behind. I can see the muscles ripple in Cato's arms as he sharply jerks the boy's head to the side.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="加图气急败坏，把火发在那堆东西上，他用脚踢着那些烧毁的瓶瓶罐罐和板条箱，其他人在废墟上四处转悠。三区的男孩活干得太出色了，加图肯定也这么想，因为这时他正冲着那个男孩喊着什么。加图想从身后把他的头夹到腋下，三区男孩急忙躲闪开。加图又用双手使劲拉他的脑袋，这时我能看到加图臂膀上暴起的青筋。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The other two Careers seem to be trying to calm Cato down. I can tell he wants to return to the woods, but they keep pointing at the sky, which puzzles me until I realize, Of course. They think whoever set off the explosions is dead. They don't know about the arrows and the apples. They assume the booby trap was faulty, but that the tribute who blew up the supplies was killed doing it. If there was a cannon shot, it could have been easily lost in the subsequent explosions. The shattered remains of the thief removed by hovercraft. They retire to the far side of the lake to allow the Gamemakers to retrieve the body of the boy from District 3. And they wait.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其他两个人似乎想要劝加图镇静下来，我可以看出他好像要回到丛林里，可另外两个人一直手指天空，我纳闷他们是什么意思，后来我明白了，当然了，他们认为那个引爆地雷的人肯定已经一命呜呼了。他们并不知道苹果和箭的事，他们觉得埋设地雷是错误的，可引爆地雷的人已为此送命，即使随后鸣炮，其声音也会被爆炸声淹没，偷补给品的贼的尸体要由直升机弄走，所以他们退到湖的另一侧，等待组委会将三区男孩的尸体带走。他们在一旁等待。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The first thing I do is dig out my own glasses and put them on, which relaxes me a little, to have at least one of my hunter's senses working. I drink some water and wash the blood from my ear. Fearing the smell of meat will draw unwanted predators -- fresh blood is bad enough -- I make a good meal out of the greens and roots and berries Rue and I gathered today.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我做的第一件事是把我的夜视镜拿出来戴上，这让我稍微放松下来，因为至少作为猎手的一种感官还在起作用。我喝了点水，把耳朵里的血洗掉。我担心肉味会引来食肉动物——血腥味也够呛——我就吃了露露和我一起摘的一些野菜、植物茎块和浆果，不错。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The dizziness has subsided and while my left ear is still deafened, I can hear a ringing in my right, which seems a good sign. There's no point in leaving my hiding place, though. I'm about as safe as I can be, here at the crime scene. They probably think the bomber has a two- or three-hour lead on them. Still it's a long time before I risk moving.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="晕眩已渐渐过去，可左耳仍听不见，右耳嗡嗡地响，这也许是好兆头。我现在没必要离开自己的藏身之处。这是靠近“犯罪现场”最安全的地方了，他们肯定认为引爆人已逃出去两三个小时了，在我冒险逃跑之前，还要等很长时间。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I suppose a cannon goes off. A hovercraft appears and takes the dead boy. The sun dips below the horizon. Night falls. Up in the sky, I see the seal and know the anthem must have begun. A moment of darkness. They show the boy from District 3. They show the boy from District 10, who must have died this morning. Then the seal reappears. So, now they know. The bomber survived. In the seal's light, I can see Cato and the girl from District 2 put on their night-vision glasses. The boy from District 1 ignites a tree branch for a torch, illuminating the grim determination on all their faces. The Careers stride back into the woods to hunt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随后传来炮声，直升机出现，将尸体拖走。太阳已落到地平线下，夜晚来临。天空出现帕纳姆市徽，国歌响起。一阵黑暗之后，出现了三区男孩的影像，还有十区的男孩，肯定是今早死去的，之后市徽再次出现。现在他们知道，引爆地雷的人没死。借着天空中市徽出现时的光亮，我看到加图和二区的女孩戴上了夜视镜，一区的男孩点燃一个树枝当做火把，他们的脸在火光的映衬下清晰可见，严肃的面孔上显出决计报复的神情。几个职业选手冲入丛林，开始新一轮的追杀。">查看中文翻译</div>

The betting must be getting really hot in the Capitol. They'll be doing special features on each of us now. Probably interviewing our friends and families. It's been a long time since a tribute from District 12 made it into the top eight. And now there are two of us. Although from what Cato said, Peeta's on his way out. Not that Cato is the final word on anything. Didn't he just lose his entire stash of supplies?</div>

<div class="line_en">A cold breeze has sprung up. I reach for my sleeping bag before I remember I left it with Rue. I was supposed to pick up another one, but what with the mines and all, I forgot. I begin to shiver. Since roosting overnight in a tree isn't sensible anyway, I scoop out a hollow under the bushes and cover myself with leaves and pine needles. I'm still freezing. I lay my sheet of plastic over my upper body and position my backpack to block the wind. It's a little better. I begin to have more sympathy for the girl from District 8 that lit the fire that first night. But now it's me who needs to grit my teeth and tough it out until morning. More leaves, more pine needles. I pull my arms inside my jacket and tuck my knees up to my chest. Somehow, I drift off to sleep.</div>

<div class="line_en">I peer through the bushes, afraid the Careers have returned, trapping me here for an indefinite time. No, it's Foxface, standing in the rubble of the pyramid and laughing. She's smarter than the Careers, actually finding a few useful items in the ashes. A metal pot. A knife blade. I'm perplexed by her amusement until I realize that with the Careers' stores eliminated, she might actually stand a chance. Just like the rest of us. It crosses my mind to reveal myself and enlist her as a second ally against that pack. But I rule it out. There's something about that sly grin that makes me sure that befriending Foxface would ultimately get me a knife in the back. With that in mind, this might be an excellent time to shoot her. But she's heard something, not me, because her head turns away, toward the drop-off, and she sprints for the woods. I wait. No one, nothing shows up. Still, if Foxface thought it was dangerous, maybe it's time for me to get out of here, too. Besides, I'm eager to tell Rue about the pyramid.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我从树丛偷偷往外看，很害怕职业选手已经返回，要把我长时间困在这里。不，是狐狸脸，正站在废墟上哈哈地笑。她比那帮人聪明，在废墟中找到了一些有用的东西，一个铁锅、一块刀片。她的自鸣得意令我不解，之后我明白了她的心思，职业选手补给品报销了，她就跟我们其他人一样，有了获胜的机会。我脑中突然闪过一个念头，跟她也结为同盟，但我很快排除了这个想法。她脸上狡黠的笑让我觉得与她结盟的最后结果就是后背挨上一刀。这么一想，我觉得现在也许是射死她的好时机。但她好像听到了什么，不是我的声音，她扭过头，飞快地跑向树林。我等着，没有人，什么也没有出现。但不管怎样，如果狐狸脸觉得危险临近，那最好我也赶快离开。再说，我也想赶快把爆炸的事告诉露露。">查看中文翻译</div>

I hurry, loaded bow in one hand, a hunk of cold groosling in the other, because I'm famished now, and not just for leaves and berries but for the fat and protein in the meat. The trip to the stream is uneventful. Once there, I refill my water and wash, taking particular care with my injured ear. Then I travel uphill using the stream as a guide. At one point, I find boot prints in the mud along the bank. The Careers have been here, but not for a while. The prints are deep because they were made in soft mud, but now they're nearly dry in the hot sun. I haven't been careful enough about my own tracks, counting on a light tread and the pine needles to conceal my prints. Now I strip off my boots and socks and go barefoot up the bed of the stream.</div>

I find myself pawing at my left ear periodically, trying to clean away whatever deadens its ability to collect sounds. If there's improvement, it's undetectable. I can't adjust to deafness in the ear. It makes me feel off-balanced and defenseless to my left. Blind even. My head keeps turning to the injured side, as my right ear tries to compensate for the wall of nothingness where yesterday there was a constant flow of information.

By now she should have returned, as it's midday. Undoubtedly, she spent the night in a tree somewhere. What else could she do with no light and the Careers with their night-vision glasses tromping around the woods. And the third fire she was supposed to set -- although I forgot to check for it last night -- was the farthest from our site of all. She's probably just being cautious about making her way back. I wish she'd hurry, because I don't want to hang around here too long. I want to spend the afternoon traveling to higher ground, hunting as we go.

<div class="line_cn" title="听觉失衡，我感觉易受攻击，于是就爬到一棵树上等候，如果职业选手出现，从树上射箭位置也很有利。太阳在天上缓缓地移动，我得做点事来打发时间，我嚼碎草药，给蜇伤处敷上，蜇伤的地方已经消肿了，但肉皮还很嫩；用手指梳理了湿头发，编好辫子；从后面把靴子带系好；检查了一下箭袋，还有九支；拿树叶在左耳边晃动，试试是否能听见，可还是什么也听不到。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I wash the blood out of my jacket and hair and clean my ever-growing list of wounds. The burns are much better but I use a bit of medicine on them anyway. The main thing to worry about now is keeping out infection. I go ahead and eat the second fish. It isn't going to last long in this hot sun, but it should be easy enough to spear a few more for Rue. If she would just show up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我把夹克和头发上的血洗掉，清洗越来越多的伤口。烧伤在用药之后好多了。现在最主要的问题是感染。我又吃了一条鱼。鱼在炎热的阳光下很难保存，再说给露露再抓一两条鱼也不是什么难事，如果她能出现的话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I slowly peel and eat a handful of nuts. My last cracker. The groosling neck. That's good because it takes time to pick clean. Finally, a groosling wing and the bird is history. But it's a hollow day, and even with all that I start daydreaming about food. Particularly the decadent dishes served in the Capitol. The chicken in creamy orange sauce. The cakes and pudding. Bread with butter. Noodles in green sauce. The lamb and dried plum stew. I suck on a few mint leaves and tell myself to get over it. Mint is good because we drink mint tea after supper often, so it tricks my stomach into thinking eating time is over. Sort of.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我慢慢地剥着皮，吃了一把坚果，直到吃完最后一个，还吃了鸟脖子，这东西现在吃很合适，因为有时间把骨头剔干净，最后吃了鸟翅膀，于是那只鸟就成为了历史。可今天真是很饿，尽管吃了那么多，我还是禁不住做起吃美食的白日梦，特别想起了在凯匹特吃的精制的食物。橘汁奶油烤鸡、蛋糕和布丁、黄油面包、绿色浓汁面条、杏干炖羊腿。我吮吸了一下薄荷叶，让自己清醒一下。薄荷很好，我们晚饭后总是喝薄荷茶，它告诉我的胃吃饭时间已经结束，可以这么说吧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dangling up in the tree, with the sun warming me, a mouthful of mint, my bow and arrows at hand… this is the most relaxed I've been since I've entered the arena. If only Rue would show up, and we could clear out. As the shadows grow, so does my restlessness. By late afternoon, I've resolved to go looking for her. I can at least visit the spot where she set the third fire and see if there are any clues to her whereabouts.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在我挂在树上，太阳暖暖地照着，嘴里含着薄荷叶，手里拿着弓，这是自从我进入竞技场以来最惬意的时刻。只要露露快点出现，我们就可以出发了。树影越来越斜，我也越来越待不住了，接近黄昏时，我决定去找她。我至少可以去她燃放第三堆篝火的地方找她，看看是否有她的踪迹。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In less than an hour, I'm at the place where we agreed to have the third fire and I know something has gone amiss. The wood has been neatly arranged, expertly interspersed with tinder, but it has never been lit. Rue set up the fire but never made it back here. Somewhere between the second column of smoke I spied before I blew up the supplies and this point, she ran into trouble.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不到一个小时，我就到了我们相约点燃第三堆篝火的地方，这里有什么地方不对头。木头整齐地码放着，周围老练地撒满易燃的叶子，但却从未点燃过。露露堆起柴火，却没能赶回来。我引爆地雷前看到第二堆篝火发出的浓烟，那么就是说在点燃第三堆篝火时，她遇到了麻烦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I have to remind myself she's still alive. Or is she? Could the cannon shot announcing her death have come in the wee hours of the morning when even my good ear was too broken to pick it up? Will she appear in the sky tonight? No, I refuse to believe it. There could be a hundred other explanations. She could have lost her way. Run into a pack of predators or another tribute, like Thresh, and had to hide. Whatever happened, I'm almost certain she's stuck out there, somewhere between the second fire and the unlit one at my feet. Something is keeping her up a tree.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我不得不提醒自己她还活着，抑或，她确实还活着吗？是不是今早鸣炮时我的比较好的那只耳朵也太聋而没听到？她会在今晚的影像中出现吗？不，我绝不相信。对此还有一百种其他的解释。她迷路了吗？碰到野兽了？或碰到其他选手了，比如萨里什，而不得不躲开？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I grin and move in the direction of the bird. Another just a short distance ahead, picks up on the handful of notes. Rue has been singing to them, and recently. Otherwise they'd have taken up some other song. My eyes lift up into the trees, searching for a sign of her. I swallow and sing softly back, hoping she'll know it's safe to join me. A mockingjay repeats the melody to me. And that's when I hear the scream.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我咧开嘴笑了，朝鸟叫的方向跑去。就在前面不远处，另一只鸟也鸣唱起这简短的小调，露露确实给鸟唱过歌，而且就在不久前，不然这些鸟会鸣唱别的曲调。我抬头向树上望去，希望能找到她的踪迹，我学着鸟叫声，哼出这个曲调，想让她知道现在和我会合是安全的，另一只嘲笑鸟学着我的声音，啾啾地叫着。这时我突然听到尖叫声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It's a relief to be doing something after sitting around all afternoon. I creep silently through the shadows, letting them conceal me. But nothing seems suspicious. There's no sign of any kind of struggle, no disruption of the needles on the ground. I've stopped for just a moment when I hear it. I have to cock my head around to the side to be sure, but there it is again. Rue's four-note tune coming out of a mockingjay's mouth. The one that means she's all right.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="呆坐了一下午，现在终于有点事干，心里感觉很畅快。我在树影里悄悄地穿行，让影子把我隐蔽起来。我没有发现任何可疑的迹象，没有打斗，四周静悄悄的。我刚刚停住脚步，却听到了那一种声音，我歪过头再仔细听听，没错，是嘲笑鸟发出的露露平安的四个音符的小调。这么说她很平安。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It's a child's scream, a young girl's scream, there's no one in the arena capable of making that sound except Rue. And now I'm running, knowing this may be a trap, knowing the three Careers may be poised to attack me, but I can't help myself. There's another high-pitched cry, this time my name. "Katniss! Katniss!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那是孩子的尖叫，一个女孩，在竞技场，除了露露之外，还没有一个女孩能发出这种声音。听到叫声我赶快跑开，恐怕是陷阱，因为我知道职业选手随时都可能攻击我。但是又传来了另一声尖叫，这次听得很清：“凯特尼斯，凯特尼斯！”">查看中文翻译</div>
