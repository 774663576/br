<div class="line_en">After they cut down the sycamore tree, it seemed like everything else fell apart, too. Champ died. And then I found out about the eggs. It was Champ's time to go, and even though I still miss him, I think it's been easier for me to deal with his death than it has been for me to deal with the truth about the eggs. I still cannot believe it about the eggs.</div>

<div class="line_en">The eggs came before the chickens in our case, but the dog came before them both. One night when I was about six years old, Dad came home from work with a full-grown dog tied down in the back of his truck. Someone had hit it in the middle of an intersection, and Dad had stopped to see how badly it was hurt. Then he noticed that the poor thing was skinny as a rail and didn't have any tags. "Starving and completely disoriented," he told my mother. "Can you imagine someone abandoning their dog like that?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Then my mother started noticing an odor. A mysterious odor of indeterminate origin. We all admitted we smelled it, too, but where my mother was convinced it was Eau de Champ, we disagreed. She had us bathing him so often that it couldn't possibly be him. We each sniffed him out pretty good and he smelled perfectly rosy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后妈妈开始注意到了气味。一股没来源的神秘的臭味。我们都承认闻到了，但是当我妈妈相信是来自钱普的时候，我们全都不同意。她让我们经常给他洗澡，几乎不可能是他。我们每个人都闻过他，而他闻起来绝对很好。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">By the end of the week, the dog was named Champ. By the end of the next week, he'd made it from the backyard into the kitchen area. And not too long after that, he was all moved in. It seemed nobody wanted a full-grown dog with a happy bark. Nobody but four-fifths of the Baker family, anyway.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那周结束前，他被命名为钱普。又过了一周，他已经从后院占领了厨房。在那之后没多久，他就到处乱跑。好像没有人会想要一只会乱叫的未成年狗。除了五分之四的贝克一家。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My personal suspicion was that Matt and Mike were the ones not bathing enough, but I didn't want to get close enough to sniff them. And since our camp was divided on just who the culprit or culprits were, the odor was dubbed the Mystery Smell. Whole dinnertime discussions revolved around the Mystery Smell, which my brothers found amusing and my mother did not.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我个人怀疑没有经常洗澡的是马特和迈克，但是我不想走近去闻。而自从我们家被分为了嫌疑人和侦探两方，那气味被命名为神秘气味。整个晚餐时间讨论都围绕着神秘气味，哥哥们觉得很有趣，可妈妈却不那么认为。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For the next two weeks I was completely consumed with the growing of chicks. I labeled the eggs A, B, C, D, E, and F, but before long they had names, too: Abby, Bonnie, Clyde, Dexter, Eunice, and Florence. Every day I weighed them, candled them, and turned them. I even thought it might be good for them to hear some clucking, so for a while I did that, too, but clucking is tiring! It was much easier to hum around my quiet little flock, so I did that, instead. Soon I was humming without even thinking about it, because when I was around my eggs, I was happy.</div>

<div class="line_en">I was upset and pretty dazed for a while. It was raining a lot and I was riding my bike to school to avoid having to take the bus, and each day when I'd get home, I'd retreat to my room, lose myself in a novel, and simply forget about collecting eggs.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was worth it. Even after Mrs. Helms and Mrs. Stueby offered me more money per dozen, it was still worth it. So, through the rest of sixth grade, through all of seventh grade and most of eighth, I delivered eggs to the Loskis. The very best, shiniest eggs went straight to the Loskis, and in return I got a few moments alone with the world's most dazzling eyes. It was a bargain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这很值得。就算在哈姆斯和史努比太太加价了之后，我还是觉得值得。所以，六年级剩下的时间，整个七年级和大部分的八年级，我送鸡蛋到洛世奇家。最好的、闪亮的鸡蛋总是给洛世奇家，而我可以和那双世界上最闪亮的眼睛单独相处几分钟。一切都值了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then they cut down the sycamore tree. And two weeks later Champ died. He'd been spending a lot of time sleeping, and even though we didn't really know how old he was, no one was really surprised when one night Dad went out to feed him and discovered he was dead. We buried him in the backyard, and my brothers put up a cross that reads:</div>

<div class="line_en">Mrs. Stueby was the one who got me back on schedule. She called to say she'd read about the tree in the paper and was sorry about everything that had happened, but it had been some time now and she missed her eggs and was worried that my hens might quit laying. "Distress can push a bird straight into a molting, and we wouldn't want that! Feathers everywhere and not an egg in sight. I'm quite allergic to the feathers myself or I'd probably have a flock of my own, but never you mind. You just bring 'em over when you're up to it. All's I wanted was to check in and let you know how sorry I was about the tree. And your dog, too. Your mother mentioned he passed away."</div>
