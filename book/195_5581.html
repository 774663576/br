<div class="line_en">Philip asked Mr. Jacobs, the assistant-surgeon for whom he had dressed, to do the operation. Jacobs accepted with pleasure, since he was interested just then in neglected talipes and was getting together materials for a paper. He warned Philip that he could not make his foot like the other, but he thought he could do a good deal; and though he would always limp he would be able to wear a boot less unsightly than that which he had been accustomed to. Philip remembered how he had prayed to a God who was able to remove mountains for him who had faith, and he smiled bitterly.</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip went into a `small ward', which was a room on the landing, outside each ward, reserved for special cases. He remained there a month, for the surgeon would not let him go till he could walk; and, bearing the operation very well, he had a pleasant enough time. Lawson and Athelny came to see him, and one day Mrs. Athelny brought two of her children; students whom he knew looked in now and again to have a chat; Mildred came twice a week. Everyone was very kind to him, and Philip, always surprised when anyone took trouble with him, was touched and grateful. He enjoyed the relief from care; he need not worry there about the future, neither whether his money would last out nor whether he would pass his final examinations; and he could read to his heart's content. He had not been able to read much of late, since Mildred disturbed him: she would make an aimless remark when he was trying to concentrate his attention, and would not be satisfied unless he answered; whenever he was comfortably settled down with a book she would want something done and would come to him with a cork she could not draw or a hammer to drive in a nail.</div>

<div class="line_en">They arrived at the boarding-house and dismissed the cab. An untidy maid opened the door and, when Philip asked if they had rooms, said she would inquire. She fetched her mistress. A middle-aged woman, stout and business-like, came downstairs, gave them the scrutinising glance of her profession, and asked what accommodation they required.</div>

<div class="line_en">She did not like being reproached, and, retiring huffily into a haughty silence, she sat by listlessly while Philip made the preparations for their departure. The little flat was hot and stuffy under the August sun, and from the road beat up a malodorous sultriness. As he lay in his bed in the small ward with its red, distempered walls he had longed for fresh air and the splashing of the sea against his breast. He felt he would go mad if he had to spend another night in London. Mildred recovered her good temper when she saw the streets of Brighton crowded with people making holiday, and they were both in high spirits as they drove out to Kemp Town. Philip stroked the baby's cheek.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她不喜欢遭人责怪，气急败坏地做出副傲慢样子，一声不吭。菲利普把要带走的行李收拾起来，她就没精打采地坐在一边。八月的烈阳下，这间小公寓又热又闷，楼下马路蒸腾出一股灼人热浪，掺杂着扑鼻恶臭袭窗而来。当他躺在病房的小床上，面对着涂了红漆的墙，满心想的都是溅起的海浪扑到胸膛上。他觉得自己哪怕再在伦敦多待一天都能发疯。米尔德里德看着大街上挤满了准备去度假的人，脾气已经消了大半，他们坐上去肯普敦的车，心情都格外明媚。菲利普疼爱地摸着孩子的小脸。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There were about a dozen people in the boarding-house. They ate in a narrow, dark room at a long table, at the head of which the landlady sat and carved. The food was bad. The landlady called it French cooking, by which she meant that the poor quality of the materials was disguised by ill-made sauces: plaice masqueraded as sole and New Zealand mutton as lamb. The kitchen was small and inconvenient, so that everything was served up lukewarm. The people were dull and pretentious; old ladies with elderly maiden daughters; funny old bachelors with mincing ways; pale-faced, middle-aged clerks with wives, who talked of their married daughters and their sons who were in a very good position in the Colonies. At table they discussed Miss Corelli's latest novel; some of them liked Lord Leighton better than Mr. Alma-Tadema, and some of them liked Mr. Alma-Tadema better than Lord Leighton. Mildred soon told the ladies of her romantic marriage with Philip; and he found himself an object of interest because his family, county people in a very good position, had cut him off with a shilling because he married while he was only a stoodent; and Mildred's father, who had a large place down Devonshire way, wouldn't do anything for them because she had married Philip. That was why they had come to a boarding-house and had not a nurse for the baby; but they had to have two rooms because they were both used to a good deal of accommodation and they didn't care to be cramped. The other visitors also had explanations of their presence: one of the single gentlemen generally went to the Metropole for his holiday, but he liked cheerful company and you couldn't get that at one of those expensive hotels; and the old lady with the middle-aged daughter was having her beautiful house in London done up and she said to her daughter: "Gwennie, my dear, we must have a cheap holiday this year," and so they had come there, though of course it wasn't at all the kind of thing they were used to. Mildred found them all very superior, and she hated a lot of common, rough people. She liked gentlemen to be gentlemen in every sense of the word.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这家寄宿旅馆里大概住着十来个人。大家在一间窄小昏暗的屋子里围着长桌吃饭，桌子一头坐着房东太太，负责给住客们切面包和肉。伙食糟糕透了，房东太太管这叫法式烹饪，意思就是把黏糊糊的酱汁往各种各样劣质食材上一浇：拿鲽鱼肉冒充鳎鱼，拿新西兰老羊肉代替羔羊肉。厨房也是小小的一间，做什么都不方便，端上来的菜都已经不够热乎了。房客们愚不可及，狂妄自大；有几个老太太带着一把年纪还没嫁出去的女儿住在这儿，还有个把喜欢装腔作势的滑稽的老光棍；脸色苍白的中年职员和妻子喜欢拿自己已经嫁出去的女儿和儿子来吹牛，说他们在殖民地过的是人上人的日子。这些人围着桌子讨论科雷利小姐最新的作品，有些喜欢莱顿勋爵超过阿尔玛—塔德玛，有些则刚好相反。米尔德里德很快就跟这里的女房客讲了她和菲利普浪漫甜蜜的婚姻，而菲利普也发现自己成了众人注目的焦点，因为在米尔德里德口中，他出身郡中名门，却因为还是“淆生”才早早结了婚而被剥夺了继承权。米尔德里德的父亲在德文郡有好大一片家产，但也不肯给他们什么东西，他生气自己的女儿嫁给了菲利普。正因如此，小两口才不得不住在寄宿旅馆，也没有给孩子请保姆。但是他们大房子住惯了，不习惯在小屋子里憋着，所以一气儿在这租了两间房。其他房客也纷纷解释了来这儿住下的原因：有位单身男士一般都去“大都会”酒店度假，但他喜欢和别人作伴，在那种豪华酒店里可找不到志同道合的有趣伙伴。老妇人带着一把年纪还待字闺中的女儿，说她们在伦敦的房子正在修建中，还嘱咐女儿：“格温妮，亲爱的，咱们今年度假可得去个便宜的地方。”所以，尽管她们以前从不会到这种地方度假，但今年还是勉强来了。米尔德里德觉得这些人都很上档次，她痛恨粗俗平庸的人。她喜欢的男人都是“不折不扣的绅士”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The remark seemed cryptic to Philip, but when he heard her say it two or three times to different persons, and found that it aroused hearty agreement, he came to the conclusion that it was only obscure to his own intelligence. It was the first time that Philip and Mildred had been thrown entirely together. In London he did not see her all day, and when he came home the household affairs, the baby, the neighbours, gave them something to talk about till he settled down to work. Now he spent the whole day with her. After breakfast they went down to the beach; the morning went easily enough with a bathe and a stroll along the front; the evening, which they spent on the pier, having put the baby to bed, was tolerable, for there was music to listen to and a constant stream of people to look at; (Philip amused himself by imagining who they were and weaving little stories about them; he had got into the habit of answering Mildred's remarks with his mouth only so that his thoughts remained undisturbed;) but the afternoons were long and dreary.

<div class="line_en">It exasperated him because it showed that she was not listening to anything he said, and yet, if he was silent, she reproached him for sulkiness. Her mind was of an order that could not deal for five minutes with the abstract, and when Philip gave way to his taste for generalising she very quickly showed that she was bored. Mildred dreamt a great deal, and she had an accurate memory for her dreams, which she would relate every day with prolixity.</div>

<div class="line_en">He discovered that it was difficult to talk to her. She had not even the power of attending to what she was herself saying, so that a dog running in front of her or the passing of a man in a loud blazer would call forth a remark and then she would forget what she had been speaking of. She had a bad memory for names, and it irritated her not to be able to think of them, so that she would pause in the middle of some story to rack her brains. Sometimes she had to give it up, but it often occurred to her afterwards, and when Philip was talking of something she would interrupt him.</div>

<div class="line_en">One morning he received a long letter from Thorpe Athelny. He was taking his holiday in the theatrical way, in which there was much sound sense, which characterised him. He had done the same thing for ten years. He took his whole family to a hop-field in Kent, not far from Mrs. Athelny's home, and they spent three weeks hopping. It kept them in the open air, earned them money, much to Mrs. Athelny's satisfaction, and renewed their contact with mother earth. It was upon this that Athelny laid stress. The sojourn in the fields gave them a new strength; it was like a magic ceremony, by which they renewed their youth and the power of their limbs and the sweetness of the spirit: Philip had heard him say many fantastic, rhetorical, and picturesque things on the subject. Now Athelny invited him to come over for a day, he had certain meditations on Shakespeare and the musical glasses which he desired to impart, and the children were clamouring for a sight of Uncle Philip. Philip read the letter again in the afternoon when he was sitting with Mildred on the beach. He thought of Mrs. Athelny, cheerful mother of many children, with her kindly hospitality and her good humour; of Sally, grave for her years, with funny little maternal ways and an air of authority, with her long plait of fair hair and her broad forehead; and then in a bunch of all the others, merry, boisterous, healthy, and handsome. His heart went out to them. There was one quality which they had that he did not remember to have noticed in people before, and that was goodness. It had not occurred to him till now, but it was evidently the beauty of their goodness which attracted him. In theory he did not believe in it: if morality were no more than a matter of convenience good and evil had no meaning. He did not like to be illogical, but here was simple goodness, natural and without effort, and he thought it beautiful. Meditating, he slowly tore the letter into little pieces; he did not see how he could go without Mildred, and he did not want to go with her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天早上，菲利普收到索普·阿西尔尼的来信。他的假期极富戏剧色彩，不管是去哪儿还是干什么，都安排得合理妥善，充分体现了他特有的缜密心思。连续十年，每年他都这样度假：带着全家老小到肯特郡的啤酒花田，这里离阿西尔尼夫人的娘家不远。他们就在这儿待三个星期，每天都跑到地里采啤酒花，既能在室外呼吸新鲜空气，又能挣些外快，既遂了阿西尔尼夫人的心意，还可以和土地母亲来次亲密接触。阿西尔尼所强调的也正是这点。站在蓝天之下、土地之上，整个人似乎都充满新的力量。就像一场神秘的仪式，他们借此机会重获青春，四肢复而有力，思想又见活跃。菲利普听他唠叨过很多假期发生的事，他用尽各种华丽辞藻，把在田里干农活的经历描绘得天花乱坠。他写信来邀菲利普过去待一天。他说自己最近对莎士比亚和玻璃琴做了些研究，想要和菲利普交流一番。另外，孩子们都吵着闹着要见菲利普叔叔呢。下午，菲利普和米尔德里德在沙滩闲坐，他掏出信来又读了一遍。他想到阿西尔尼夫人。那是个生养了好多小孩的母亲，性格快活、待人友善、脾气温和。还有萨莉，小小年纪却成熟稳重，带着点儿滑稽的、慈母般的气质和不怒自威的神气，浓密的头发绑成长长的辫子，露着又宽又平的额头。除了她之外，家里还有一群欢天喜地、吵闹顽皮、健康漂亮的孩子。菲利普很喜欢他们。阿西尔尼一家身上有种特质，他之前还从没在其他人身上寻到过，那特质就是善良。一直到现在他才发现这一点，可毫无疑问，从一开始吸引菲利普的就是他们美好而善良的心。这从理论上似乎说不通：若道德只是件行方便的事，那么善恶就都失去了意义。他不想失掉逻辑，把脑子搅成一锅粥，但确实存在这一种单纯的善良，不加矫饰，不经修缮，而他觉得这种善良美极了。沉思片刻，他慢慢把这封信撕得粉碎。他不知道怎么甩掉米尔德里德独自前往，更不愿带着她一同登门。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was very hot, the sky was cloudless, and they had been driven to a shady corner. The baby was gravely playing with stones on the beach, and now and then she crawled up to Philip and gave him one to hold, then took it away again and placed it carefully down. She was playing a mysterious and complicated game known only to herself. Mildred was asleep. She lay with her head thrown back and her mouth slightly open; her legs were stretched out, and her boots protruded from her petticoats in a grotesque fashion. His eyes had been resting on her vaguely, but now he looked at her with peculiar attention. He remembered how passionately he had loved her, and he wondered why now he was entirely indifferent to her. The change in him filled him with dull pain. It seemed to him that all he had suffered had been sheer waste. The touch of her hand had filled him with ecstasy; he had desired to enter into her soul so that he could share every thought with her and every feeling; he had suffered acutely because, when silence had fallen between them, a remark of hers showed how far their thoughts had travelled apart, and he had rebelled against the unsurmountable wall which seemed to divide every personality from every other. He found it strangely tragic that he had loved her so madly and now loved her not at all. Sometimes he hated her. She was incapable of learning, and the experience of life had taught her nothing. She was as unmannerly as she had always been. It revolted Philip to hear the insolence with which she treated the hard-worked servant at the boarding-house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="天热得很，抬头是明晃晃的一片天，一丝云彩都没有。他们只好找片阴凉地避暑。孩子坐在沙滩上煞有介事地玩着几块小石头，不时爬过来往菲利普掌心放一块，然后又夺回去，小心翼翼地放在地上摆好。她正在玩的一种神秘而复杂的游戏，显然只有她自己才能明白。米尔德里德睡着了。她平躺着，头往后仰，嘴微微张开；两条腿伸直了，靴子露出衬裙，摆了个古怪的姿势。菲利普迷迷糊糊地打量着她，精力全都集中在她身上。他记起自己曾经疯狂地爱着她，却不知为何现在对她毫无感觉。这种转变让他心里又苦又痛，仿佛经历过的所有辛酸苦楚都成了白白浪费。过去摸一下她的手都要兴奋得久久难以平静，想走进她的灵魂，想分享她一点一滴的情绪和感想。爱情让他痛彻心扉，因为每每两人之间只余沉默，她随便一句话就会让他知道原来他和她只是分向而行，愈行愈远。人和人之间似乎隔着一面不可逾越的墙，而他竟傻得试图越过这堵墙。昔日疯狂的爱如今已如烟云散尽，他从中品出莫名的悲伤滋味。她是个不知悔改的人，以往的生活经历也没让她学到些什么，还是跟以前一样粗野无礼。有时她对餐馆里辛勤工作的女侍者横眉竖眼，菲利普看在眼里，觉得非常反感。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Presently he considered his own plans. At the end of his fourth year he would be able to take his examination in midwifery, and a year more would see him qualified. Then he might manage a journey to Spain. He wanted to see the pictures which he knew only from photographs; he felt deeply that El Greco held a secret of peculiar moment to him; and he fancied that in Toledo he would surely find it out. He did not wish to do things grandly, and on a hundred pounds he might live for six months in Spain: if Macalister put him on to another good thing he could make that easily. His heart warmed at the thought of those old beautiful cities, and the tawny plains of Castile. He was convinced that more might be got out of life than offered itself at present, and he thought that in Spain he could live with greater intensity: it might be possible to practise in one of those old cities, there were a good many foreigners, passing or resident, and he should be able to pick up a living. But that would be much later; first he must get one or two hospital appointments; they gave experience and made it easy to get jobs afterwards. He wished to get a berth as ship's doctor on one of the large tramps that took things leisurely enough for a man to see something of the places at which they stopped. He wanted to go to the East; and his fancy was rich with pictures of Bangkok and Shanghai, and the ports of Japan: he pictured to himself palm-trees and skies blue and hot, dark-skinned people, pagodas; the scents of the Orient intoxicated his nostrils. His heart but with passionate desire for the beauty and the strangeness of the world.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这会儿，他开始计划自己将来的打算。学医第四年快结束的时候，他会参加产科医生考试，再过一年就能拿到行医资格。那之后，他想去西班牙旅行一趟。他想看看之前只见过照片的那些画，埃尔·格列柯的作品对他来说有些神秘的含义，也许只有身处托莱多才能明白。他没有什么宏伟的计划，大概一百镑就能在西班牙生活半年。如果麦卡利斯特再给他推荐笔好买卖，那这笔钱很容易就能赚到。想到优雅美丽的古城和卡斯提尔昏黄的平原，他的心就暖融融的。在西班牙的日子一定比现在更有意思，到那儿之后生活也会跟着充实起来，说不定还能去那里的某个古城当大夫呢。那边有很多外国人，有来往经过此地的，还有定居下来的，总之想谋个生计肯定不难。但是这都是以后的事了，他还是要先在一两个医院任职，等有了经验之后才能方便找到工作。他想在不定期的货船上当个随船医生。这种船只出行时间比较随意，刚好够他去某个陌生的地方走走看看。他想去东方瞧一瞧，幻想过许多曼谷、上海和日本港口的画面；他坐在棕榈树下，头顶是蔚蓝炽热的天空，周围是深色皮肤的东方人和神秘古老的寺庙；来自东方的幽幽香气让他沉醉不已。他满心希望去世界上所有陌生而美丽的地方走一遭。">查看中文翻译</div>
