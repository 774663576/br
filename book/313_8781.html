<div class="line_en">His forecast proved to be correct, for the detective looked blank enough when I got to Baker Street and showed him the empty box. They had only just arrived, Holmes, the prisoner, and he, for they had changed their plans so far as to report themselves at a station upon the way. My companion lounged in his armchair with his usual listless expression, while Small sat stolidly opposite to him with his wooden leg cocked over his sound one. As I exhibited the empty box he leaned back in his chair and laughed aloud.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个警官预料得果然不错，当我回到贝克街，把空箱子给那位侦探看时，他面色很不好看。他们三人——福尔摩斯、琼斯和囚犯——刚刚来到贝克街，因为他们变更了原来的计划，在中途先到警察局去作了报告。福尔摩斯仍像往常一样，懒洋洋地坐在他的椅子上，斯莫尔冷冷地坐在他对面，把那条木腿搭在好腿上面。当我把空箱子给大家看的时候，他倚着椅子，放声大笑起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes, I have put it away where you shall never lay hand upon it," he cried exultantly. "It is my treasure, and if I can't have the loot I'll take damed good care that no one else does. I tell you that no living man has any right to it, unless it is three men who are in the Andaman convict-barracks and myself. I know now that I cannot have the use of it, and I know that they cannot. I have acted all through for them as much as for myself. It's been the sign of four with us always. Well, I know that they would have had me do just what I have done, and throw the treasure into the Thames rather than let it go to kith or kin of Sholto or Morstan. It was not to make them rich that we did for Achmet. You'll find the treasure where the key is and where little Tonga is. When I saw that your launch must catch us, I put the loot away in a safe place. There are no rupees for you this journey."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不错，我已经把宝物放到你们永远拿不到的地方去了，”斯莫尔狂笑着喊道，“宝物是属于我的，如果我得不到，我就得想办法，叫谁也得不到。我告诉你，除了在安达曼岛囚犯营的三个人和我自己以外，别人没有资格得到这些宝物。我知道，现在我用不到，他们也用不到。我就代表他们三个人和我自己，把宝物处理了。四签名永远与我们同在。我知道他们三个人必然同意我这样办，宁可把宝物沉到泰晤士河河底，也不要让它落入肖尔托或摩斯坦的亲戚朋友手中。我们干掉阿基默德，并不是为了让他们去发财。你会发现，宝物和钥匙，还有汤加葬在一起了。当我看到你们的船明显能够追上我们时，我就把宝物藏到稳妥的地方去了。你们这趟是一个卢比也弄不到了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Justice!" snarled the ex-convict. "A pretty justice! Whose loot is this, if it is not ours? Where is the justice that I should give it up to those who have never earned it? Look how I have earned it! Twenty long years in that fever-ridden swamp, all day at work under the mangrove-tree, all night chained up in the filthy convict-huts, bitten by mosquitoes, racked with ague, bullied by every cursed black-faced policeman who loved to take it out of a white man. That was how I earned the Agra treasure, and you talk to me of justice because I cannot bear to feel that I have paid this price only that another may enjoy it! I would rather swing a score of times, or have one of Tonga's darts in my hide, than live in a convict's cell and feel that another man is at his ease in a palace with the money that should be mine."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“正义？！”罪犯咆哮道，“多么美好的正义啊！宝物不是我们的，还能是谁的呢？宝物不是他们赚来的，我却要给他们，难道这算公正吗？你们看看我是怎样把宝物赚到手的。整整二十年，在那热病肆虐的湿地里住着，白天整日在红树下面做苦工，夜晚整晚被锁在肮脏的囚棚里，被蚊子咬着，被疟疾折磨着，被喜欢拿白种人泄愤的该死的黑人狱卒凌辱。这是我赚到阿格拉宝物的代价，而你却要来同我讲什么正义，就因为我不能忍受自己千辛万苦得来的宝物让别人去坐享吗！我宁愿被绞死几十次，或吃汤加一根毒刺，也不甘心一边在牢狱里活着，一边想着另一个人住着豪宅，拿着应当是我的钱去快乐逍遥！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Easier for me to throw and easier for you to recover," he answered with a shrewd, side-long look. "The man that was clever enough to hunt me down is clever enough to pick an iron box from the bottom of a river. Now that they are scattered over five miles or so, it may be a harder job. It went to my heart to do it though. I was half mad when you came up with us. However, there's no good grieving over it. I've had ups in my life, and I've had downs, but I've learned not to cry over spilled milk."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我扔着省事，你们捞着也省事。”斯莫尔狡猾地斜眼看了看他，答道，“你们有本领追捕到我，就有本领在河底捞一只铁箱子。现在它们散落在长达五英里的河道里，捞起来就不太容易了。我也是横了心，才这么干的。当我看到你们追上来的时候，我几乎都要发疯了。但惋惜是没有什么用处的。我这一辈子的命运有盛有衰，但我懂得不去事后追悔。”">查看中文翻译</div>

I could understand, as I saw the fury and the passion of the man, that it was no groundless or unnatural terror which had possessed Major Sholto when he first learned that the injured convict was upon his track.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，斯莫尔已经不像以前那般沉默了，他滔滔不绝地诉说着这些话，两眼发亮，手铐随着双手激动的挥舞而叮当作响。看到他这样愤怒和冲动，我可以理解为什么肖尔托少校一听说这个受屈的囚犯在追踪他，就吓得惊恐不安，他的恐惧是有理由的，也是很自然的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, sir, you have been very fair-spoken to me, though I can see that I have you to thank that I have these bracelets upon my wrists. Still, I bear no grudge for that.

<div class="line_en">"I am a Worcestershire man myself, born near Pershore. I dare say you would find a heap of Smalls living there now if you were to look. I have often thought of taking a look round there, but the truth is that I was never much of a credit to the family, and I doubt if they would be so very glad to see me. They were all steady, chapel-going folk, small farmers, well known and respected over the countryside, while I was always a bit of a rover. At last, however, when I was about eighteen, I gave them no more trouble, for I got into a mess over a girl and could only get out of it again by taking the Queen's shilling and joining the Third Buffs, which was just starting for India."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我是伍斯特郡人，出生在珀肖尔城附近。我想，您要是去那儿一看，还能发现一堆斯莫尔家族的人住在那里。我有时很想回去看看，可事实上，我在家族中名声向来不好，我想，他们未必高兴见到我。他们全是稳重的教徒，都是在乡里受人尊敬的小农民，而我却一直是一个流浪汉。可后来，在十八岁的时候，我最终不再给他们添麻烦了，因为我谈恋爱时惹出一些纠纷，为求脱身，我只能去吃国粮，加入步兵三团，他们当时正要调往印度。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I wasn't destined to do much soldiering, however. I had just got past the goose-step and learned to handle my musket, when I was fool enough to go swimming in the Ganges. Luckily for me, my company sergeant, John Holder, was in the water at the same time, and he was one of the finest swimmers in the service. A crocodile took me just as I was halfway across and nipped off my right leg as clean as a surgeon could have done it, just above the knee. What with the shock and the loss of blood, I fainted, and should have been drowned if Holder had not caught hold of me and paddled for the bank. I was five months in hospital over it, and when at last I was able to limp out of it with this timber toe strapped to my stump, I found myself invalided out of the Army and unfitted for any active occupation."</div>

<div class="line_en">"I was, as you can imagine, pretty down on my luck at this time, for I was a useless cripple, though not yet in my twentieth year. However, my misfortune, soon proved to be a blessing in disguise. A man named Abel White, who had come out there as an indigo-planter, wanted an overseer to look after his coolies and keep them up to their work. He happened to be a friend of our colonel's, who had taken an interest in me since the accident. To make a long story short, the colonel recommended me strongly for the post, and, as the work was mostly to be done on horseback, my leg was no great obstacle, for I had enough thigh left to keep a good grip on the saddle. What I had to do was to ride over the plantation, to keep an eye on the men as they worked, and to report the idlers. The pay was fair, I had comfortable quarters, and altogether I was content to spend the remainder of my life in indigo-planting. Mr. Abel White was a kind man, and he would often drop into my little shanty and smoke a pipe with me, for white folk out there feel their hearts warm to each other as they never do here at home."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, I was never in luck's way long. Suddenly, without a note of warning, the great mutiny broke upon us. One month India lay as still and peaceful, to all appearance, as Surrey or Kent; the next there were two hundred thousand black devils let loose, and the country was a perfect hell. Of course you know all about it, gentlemen -- a deal more than I do, very like, since reading is not in my line. I only know what I saw with my own eyes. Our plantation was at a place called Muttra, near the border of the Northwest Provinces. Night after night the whole sky was alight with the burning bungalows, and day after day we had small companies of Europeans passing through our estate with their wives and children, on their way to Agra, where were the nearest troops. Mr. Abel White was an obstinate man. He had it in his head that the affair had been exaggerated, and that it would blow over as suddenly as it had sprung up. There he sat on his veranda, drinking whisky-pegs and smoking cheroots, while the country was in a blaze about him. Of course we stuck by him, I and Dawson, who, with his wife, used to do the book-work and the managing. Well, one fine day the crash came. I had been away on a distant plantation and was riding slowly home in the evening, when my eye fell upon something all huddled together at the bottom of a steep nullah. I rode down to see what it was, and the cold struck through my heart when I found it was Dawson's wife, all cut into ribbons, and half eaten by jackals and native dogs. A little further up the road Dawson himself was lying on his face, quite dead, with an empty revolver in his hand, and four sepoys lying across each other in front of him. I reined up my horse, wondering which way I should turn; but at that moment I saw thick smoke curling up from Abel White's bungalow and the flames beginning to burst through the roof. I knew then that I could do my employer no good, but would only throw my own life away if I meddled in the matter. From where I stood I could see hundreds of the black fiends, with their red coats still on their backs, dancing and howling round the burning house. Some of them pointed at me, and a couple of bullets sang past my head: so I broke away across the paddy-fields, and found myself late at night safe within the walls at Agra."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“唉，真是好景不长。突然间，毫无预兆地，大叛乱就爆发了。前一个月，印度看起来就像萨利区或肯特郡一样平静祥和，到下一个月，二十多万黑鬼子就失去了约束，整个国家变成了地狱一般。当然，你们几位绅士都知道这些事——很可能比我知道得更多呢，因为阅读不是我的专长。我只知道我亲眼看到的事情。我们的种植园的所在地叫做马图拉，靠近西北几省的边界。每天晚上，房子燃烧的火焰照得满天通红；每天白天，都有小队的欧洲士兵带着他们的家小，经过我们的庄园，开往阿格拉，那里是最近的驻有军队的地方。园主埃布尔·怀特先生是一位固执的人。他以为这些叛变的消息不免有些夸大，他想，叛乱来得快，去得也快。他依然坐在阳台上，喝着威士忌，吸着雪茄烟，可是，周围早已烽烟四起了。当然，我和管账的道森还有道森的妻子都坚定地跟随着他。唉，有一天，变故来了。那天，我去了远处的一个庄园，傍晚时，我缓缓地骑着马回来。那时，我的目光被陡峭的峡谷谷底的一堆蜷伏着的东西吸引住了。我骑马走下去一看，不禁毛骨悚然，正是道森的妻子，被人割成了一条一条的，又被豺狼和野狗吃去了一半。道森就趴在不远的地方，已经死了，手握着放空了的手枪，在他前面还躺着彼此压在一起的四个印度兵的尸首。我控着马缰，正不知往什么地方去才好，却忽然看见埃布尔·怀特的房子浓烟滚滚，火苗开始冲出屋顶。我知道，我已经帮不上主人什么忙了，掺和进去只会把自己的性命搭上。从我站的地方可以看见，上百个穿红衣的黑鬼子正在对着燃烧的房子手舞足蹈，狂吼乱叫。其中有几个人向我指了一指，跟着就有两颗流弹从我头上掠过去。我扭转马头，向稻田里狂奔而去，深夜才逃到了阿格拉城内，获得了平安。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Wherever the English could collect in little bands they held just the ground that their guns commanded. Everywhere else they were helpless fugitives. It was a fight of the millions against the hundreds; and the cruellest part of it was that these men that we fought against, foot, horse, and gunners, were our own picked troops, whom we had taught and trained, handling our own weapons and blowing our own bugle-calls. At Agra there were the Third Bengal Fusiliers, some Sikhs, two troops of horse, and a battery of artillery. A volunteer corps of clerks and merchants had been formed, and this I joined, wooden leg and all. We went out to meet the rebels at Shahgunge early in July, and we beat them back for a time, but our powder gave out, and we had to fall back upon the city."</div>

<div class="line_en">"The city of Agra is a great place, swarming with fanatics and fierce devil worshippers of all sorts. Our handful of men were lost among the narrow, winding streets. Our leader moved across the river, therefore, and took up his position in the old fort of Agra. I don't know if any of you gentlemen have ever read or heard anything of that old fort. It is a very queer place -- the queerest that ever I was in, and I have been in some rum corners, too. First of all it is enormous in size. I should think that the enclosure must be acres and acres. There is a modern part, which took all our garrison, women, children, stores, and everything else, with plenty of room over. But the modern part is nothing like the size of the old quarter, where nobody goes, and which is given over to the scorpions and the centipedes. It is all full of great deserted halls, and winding passages, and long corridors twisting in and out, so that it is easy enough for folk to get lost in it. For this reason it was seldom that anyone went into it, though now and again a party with torches might go exploring."</div>

<div class="line_en">"The river washes along the front of the old fort, and so protects it, but on the sides and behind there are many doors, and these had to be guarded, of course, in the old quarter as well as in that which was actually held by our troops. We were short-handed, with hardly men enough to man the angles of the building and to serve the guns. It was impossible for us, therefore, to station a strong guard at every one of the innumerable gates. What we did was to organize a central guardhouse in the middle of the fort, and to leave each gate under the charge of one white man and two or three natives. I was selected to take charge during certain hours of the night of a small isolated door upon the south-west side of the building. Two Sikh troopers were placed under my command, and I was instructed if anything went wrong to fire my musket, when I might rely upon help coming at once from the central guard. As the guard was a good two hundred paces away, however, and as the space between was cut up into a labyrinth of passages and corridors, I had great doubts as to whether they could arrive in time to be of any use in case of an actual attack."</div>

<div class="line_en">"The third night of my watch was dark and dirty, with a small driving rain. It was dreary work standing in the gateway hour after hour in such weather. I tried again and again to make my Sikhs talk, but without much success. At two in the morning the rounds passed and broke for a moment the weariness of the night. Finding that my companions would not be led into conversation, I took out my pipe and laid down my musket to strike the match. In an instant the two Sikhs were upon me. One of them snatched my firelock up and levelled it at my head, while the other held a great knife to my throat and swore between his teeth that he would plunge it into me if I moved a step."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, I was pretty proud at having this small command given me, since I was a raw recruit, and a game-legged one at that. For two nights I kept the watch with my Punjabees. They were tall, fierce-looking chaps, Mahomet Singh and Abdullah Khan by name, both old fighting men, who had borne arms against us at Chilian Wallah. They could talk English pretty well, but I could get little out of them. They preferred to stand together, and jabber all night in their queer Sikh lingo. For myself, I used to stand outside the gateway, looking down on the broad, winding river and on the twinkling lights of the great city. The beating of drums, the rattle of tomtoms, and the yells and howls of the rebels, drunk with opium and with bang, were enough to remind us all night of our dangerous neighbours across the stream. Every two hours the officer of the night used to come round to all the posts to make sure that all was well."</div>

If our door were in the hands of the sepoys the place must fall, and the women and children be treated as they were in Cawnpore. Maybe you gentlemen think that I am just making out a case for myself, but I give you my word that when I thought of that, though I felt the point of the knife at my throat, I opened my mouth with the intention of giving a scream, if it was my last one, which might alarm the main guard. The man who held me seemed to know my thoughts; for, even as I braced myself to it, he whispered: 'Don't make a noise. The fort is safe enough. There are no rebel dogs on this side of the river.' There was the ring of truth in what he said, and I knew that if I raised my voice I was a dead man. I could read it in the fellow's brown eyes. I waited, therefore, in silence, to see what it was that they wanted from me."</div>

When the troubles broke out he would be friends both with the lion and the tiger -- with the sepoy and with the Company's raj. Soon, however, it seemed to him that the white men's day was come, for through all the land he could hear of nothing but of their death and their overthrow. Yet, being a careful man, he made such plans that, come what might, half at least of his treasure should be left to him. That which was in gold and silver he kept by him in the vaults of his palace, but the most precious stones and the choicest pearls that he had he put in an iron box and sent it by a trusty servant, who, under the guise of a merchant, should take it to the fort at Agra, there to lie until the land is at peace. Thus, if the rebels won he would have his money, but if the Company conquered, his jewels would be saved to him. Having thus divided his hoard, he threw himself into the cause of the sepoys, since they were strong upon his borders.

<div class="line_en">"I could hear the measured tramp of their footsteps sounding through the lonely corridors. Suddenly it ceased, and I heard voices and a scuffle, with the sound of blows. A moment later there came, to my horror, a rush of footsteps coming in my direction, with a loud breathing of a running man. I turned my lantern down the long straight passage, and there was the fat man, running like the wind, with a smear of blood across his face, and close at his heels, bounding like a tiger, the great black-bearded Sikh, with a knife flashing in his hand. I have never seen a man run so fast as that little merchant. He was gaining on the Sikh, and I could see that if he once passed me and got to the open air he would save himself yet. My heart softened to him, but again the thought of his treasure turned me hard and bitter. I cast my firelock between his legs as he raced past and he rolled twice over like a shot rabbit. Ere he could stagger to his feet the Sikh was upon him and buried his knife twice in his side. The man never uttered moan nor moved muscle but lay where he had fallen. I think myself that he may have broken his neck with the fall. You see, gentlemen, that I am keeping my promise. I am telling you every word of the business just exactly as it happened, whether it is in my favour or not."</div>

Whatever punishment was in store for him, I felt that he might expect no sympathy from me.

A key was hung by a silken cord to that carved handle upon the top. We opened it, and the light of the lantern gleamed upon a collection of gems such as I have read of and thought about when I was a little lad at Pershore. It was blinding to look upon them. When we had feasted our eyes we took them all out and made a list of them. There were one hundred and forty-three diamonds of the first water, including one which has been called, I believe, 'the Great Mogul,' and is said to be the second largest stone in existence. Then there were ninety-seven very fine emeralds, and one hundred and seventy rubies, some of which, however, were small. There were forty carbuncles, two hundred and ten sapphires, sixty-one agates, and a great quantity of beryls, onyxes, cats'-eyes, turquoises, and other stones, the very names of which I did not know at the time, though I have become more familiar with them since. Besides this, there were nearly three hundred very fine pearls, twelve of which were set in a gold coronet. By the way, these last had been taken out of the chest, and were not there when I recovered it."</div>

Then we solemnly renewed our oath to stand by each other and be true to our secret. We agreed to conceal our loot in a safe place until the country should be at peace again, and then to divide it equally among ourselves. There was no use dividing it at present, for if gems of such value were found upon us it would cause suspicion, and there was no privacy in the fort nor any place where we could keep them. We carried the box, therefore, into the same hall where we had buried the body, and there, under certain bricks in the best-preserved wall, we made a hollow and put our treasure. We made careful note of the place, and next day I drew four plans, one for each of us, and put the sign of the four of us at the bottom, for we had sworn that we should each always act for all, so that none might take advantage. That is an oath that I can put my hand to my heart and swear that I have never broken."</div>

<div class="line_en">"It came about in this way. When the rajah put his jewels into the hands of Achmet he did it because he knew that he was a trusty man. They are suspicious folk in the East, however: so what does this rajah do but take a second even more trusty servant and set him to play the spy upon the first. This second man was ordered never to let Achmet out of his sight, and he followed him like his shadow. He went after him that night and saw him pass through the doorway. Of course he thought he had taken refuge in the fort and applied for admission there himself next day, but could find no trace of Achmet. This seemed to him so strange that he spoke about it to a sergeant of guides, who brought it to the ears of the commandant. A thorough search was quickly made, and the body was discovered. Thus at the very moment that we thought that all was safe we were all four seized and brought to trial on a charge of murder -- three of us because we had held the gate that night, and the fourth because he was known to have been in the company of the murdered man. Not a word about the jewels came out at the trial, for the rajah had been deposed and driven out of India: so no one had any particular interest in them. The murder, however, was clearly made out, and it was certain that we must all have been concerned in it. The three Sikhs got penal servitude for life, and I was condemned to death, though my sentence was afterwards commuted to the same as the others."</div>

I was given a hut in Hope Town, which is a small place on the slopes of Mount Harriet, and I was left pretty much to myself. It is a dreary, fever-stricken place, and all beyond our little clearings was infested with wild cannibal natives, who were ready enough to blow a poisoned dart at us if they saw a chance. There was digging and ditching and yam-planting, and a dozen other things to be done, so we were busy enough all day, though in the evening we had a little time to ourselves. Among other things, I learned to dispense drugs for the surgeon, and picked up a smattering of his knowledge.

The surgery, where I used to make up my drugs, was next to his sitting-room, with a small window between us. Often, if I felt lonesome, I used to turn out the lamp in the surgery, and then, standing there, I could hear their talk and watch their play. I am fond of a hand at cards myself, and it was almost as good as having one to watch the others. There was Major Sholto, Captain Morstan, and Lieutenant Bromley Brown, who were in command of the native troops, and there was the surgeon himself, and two or three prison-officials, crafty old hands who played a nice sly safe game.

Night after night the soldiers got up poorer men, and the poorer they got the more keen they were to play. Major Sholto was the hardest hit. He used to pay in notes and gold at first, but soon it came to notes of hand and for big sums. He sometimes would win for a few deals just to give him heart, and then the luck would set in against him worse than ever.

Captain Morstan was then to apply for leave of absence, to meet us at Agra, and there we were to have a final division of the treasure, he taking the major's share as well as his own.

The villain Sholto went off to India, but he never came back again. Captain Morstan showed me his name among a list of passengers in one of the mail-boats very shortly afterwards. His uncle had died, leaving him a fortune, and he had left the Army, yet he could stoop to treat five men as he had treated us. Morstan went over to Agra shortly afterwards and found, as we expected, that the treasure was indeed gone. The scoundrel had stolen it all without carrying out one of the conditions on which we had sold him the secret. From that I lived only for vengeance. I thought of it by day and I nursed it by night. It became an overpowering, absorbing passion with me. I cared nothing for the law -- nothing for the gallows. To escape, to track down Sholto, to have my hand upon his throat -- that was my one thought. Even the Agra treasure had come to be a smaller thing in my mind than the slaying of Sholto."</div>

He was sick to death and had gone to a lonely place to die. I took him in hand, though he was as venomous as a young snake, and after a couple of months I got him all right and able to walk.

With three long hops I was on him. He put his carbine to his shoulder, but I struck him full, and knocked the whole front of his skull in. You can see the split in the wood now where I hit him. We both went down together, for I could not keep my balance; but when I got up I found him still lying quiet enough. I made for the boat, and in an hour we were well out at sea. Tonga had brought all his earthly possessions with him, his arms and his gods. Among other things, he had a long bamboo spear, and some Andaman cocoanut-matting, with which I made a sort of a sail. For ten days we were beating about, trusting to luck, and on the eleventh we were picked up by a trader which was going from Singapore to Jiddah with a cargo of Malay pilgrims.

I had always vowed vengeance, and now I had my chance. It was as if fate had placed him in my way that I might pay my debt before I left the island.

A hundred times I have killed him in my sleep. At last, however, some three or four years ago, we found ourselves in England. I had no great difficulty in finding where Sholto lived, and I set to work to discover whether he had realized on the treasure, or if he still had it. I made friends with someone who could help me -- I name no names, for I don't want to get anyone else in a hole -- and I soon found that he still had the jewels.

I'd have come through and taken my chance with the three of them, only even as I looked at him his jaw dropped, and I knew that he was gone. I got into his room that same night, though, and I searched his papers to see if there was any record of where he had hidden our jewels. There was not a line, however, so I came away, bitter and savage as a man could be. Before I left I bethought me that if I ever met my Sikh friends again it would be a satisfaction to know that I had left some mark of our hatred; so I scrawled down the sign of the four of us, as it had been on the chart, and I pinned it on his bosom.

He would eat raw meat and dance his war-dance: so we always had a hatful of pennies after a day's work. I still heard all the news from Pondicherry Lodge, and for some years there was no news to hear, except that they were hunting for the treasure. At last, however, came what we had waited for so long. The treasure had been found. It was up at the top of the house in Mr. Bartholomew Sholto's chemical laboratory. I came at once and had a look at the place, but I could not see how, with my wooden leg, I was to make my way up to it. I learned, however, about a trapdoor in the roof, and also about Mr. Sholto's supper-hour. It seemed to me that I could manage the thing easily through Tonga. I brought him out with me with a long rope wound round his waist. He could climb like a cat, and he soon made his way through the roof, but as ill luck would have it, Bartholomew Sholto was still in the room, to his cost. Tonga thought he had done something very clever in killing him, for when I came up by the rope I found him strutting about as proud as a peacock. Very much surprised was he when I made at him with the rope's end and cursed him for a little bloodthirsty imp. I took the treasure box and let it down, and then slid down myself, having first left the sign of the four upon the table to show that the jewels had come back at last to those who had most right to them. Tonga then pulled up the rope, closed the window, and made off the way that he had come."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我想，我要说的都说完了。我听一个船夫称赞过史密斯的‘曙光’号速度很快，因此我想到，它倒是我们逃走的便利工具。我便雇了老史密斯，说好如果他能把我们安然送上大船，就给他一大笔酬金。当然，他可能看得出来，这里面有一些蹊跷，可是他并不知道我们的秘密。所有这些，句句属实，先生们，我说这些，并不是为了逗你们开心——因为你们并没有优待我。我说这些是因为，我认为毫无隐瞒就是我最好的辩护，让世人知道，肖尔托少校曾经如何害苦了我，而对于他儿子的死，我是无辜的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, Holmes," said Athelney Jones, "you are a man to be honoured, and we all know that you are a connoisseur of crime; but duty is duty, and I have gone rather far in doing what you and your friend asked me. I shall feel more at ease when we have our story-teller here safe under lock and key. The cab still waits, and there are two inspectors downstairs. I am much obliged to you both for your assistance. Of course you will be wanted at the trial. Good-night to you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“福尔摩斯，”阿塞尔纳·琼斯说，“您是一个值得尊敬的人，我们都知道您是犯罪学的行家，可是，我有我的职责，今天为您和您的朋友已经通融很多了。现在，只有把给我们讲故事的这个人锁进监狱里，我才能放心。马车还在外面候着，楼下还有两个警官呢。对于你们二位的协助，我衷心感激。自然，到庭审的时候，还要请你们出席作证。祝你们晚安吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Not at all. I think she is one of the most charming young ladies I ever met and might have been most useful in such work as we have been doing. She had a decided genius that way; witness the way in which she preserved that Agra plan from all the other papers of her father. But love is an emotional thing, and whatever is emotional is opposed to that true cold reason which I place above all things. I should never marry myself, lest I bias my judgment."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“一点儿也没有。我认为，在我生平所见的女子中，她是最迷人的一位了，并且可能是在我们这一类工作中最有帮助的一位。她在这方面确实有一些天赋，她在她父亲所有文件中独独收藏了那张阿格拉地图这件事，就可以证明这一点。可是，爱情是一种感性的事情，感性与纯粹的冷静思考相矛盾，而我认为，后者才是至高无上的。我自己永远不会结婚，以免影响我的判断力。”">查看中文翻译</div>
