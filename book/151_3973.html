<div class="line_en">So I moved to an empty table and just waited for everyone to finish stampeding and the lunchroom teacher to tell us what to do next. As she started telling us the cafeteria rules, I looked around to see where Jack Will was sitting, but I didn't see him on my side of the room. Kids were still coming in as the teachers started calling the first few tables to get their trays and stand on line at the counter. Julian, Henry, and Miles were sitting at a table toward the back of the room.</div>

<div class="line_en">Via had warned me about lunch in middle school, so I guess I should have known it would be hard. I just hadn't expected it to be this hard. Basically, all the kids from all the fifth-grade classes poured into the cafeteria at the same time, talking loudly and bumping into one another while they ran to different tables. One of the lunchroom teachers said something about no seat-saving allowed, but I didn't know what she meant and maybe no one else did, either, because just about everybody was saving seats for their friends. I tried to sit down at one table, but the kid in the next chair said, "Oh, sorry, but somebody else is sitting here."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="关于中学午餐的问题，维娅已经给我打过预防针，因此对它的糟糕我早已有心理准备。只是没想到那么糟。总之，五年级全体学生都同时涌到自助餐厅来了，大家奔向不同的餐桌，你冲我撞，高声喧哗。一位午餐室老师在交代关于不许占位的事宜，但是我没有搞清楚她的意思，也许其他人也没弄懂，因为几乎每个人都在为他们的朋友占座位。我试图在一张餐桌坐下来，但是坐在一边的同学说，“噢，对不起，这儿有人坐了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I could tell I was being stared at without even looking up. I knew that people were nudging each other, watching me out of the corners of their eyes. I thought I was used to those kinds of stares by now, but I guess I wasn't.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mom had packed me a cheese sandwich, graham crackers, and a juice box, so I didn't need to stand on line when my table was called. Instead, I just concentrated on opening my backpack, pulling out my lunch bag, and slowly opening the aluminum-foil wrapping of my sandwich.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="妈妈给我打包了一份芝士三明治、全麦饼干和一盒果汁，所以等我的桌号被叫到的时候我就用不着去排队了，只需细心打开背包，取出午餐包，慢慢打开铝箔包装的三明治。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was one table of girls that I knew were whispering about me because they were talking behind their hands. Their eyes and whispers kept bouncing over to me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我知道有一桌女孩正在悄悄议论我，因为她们说话的时候用手捂着嘴。她们在交头接耳，眼神不时地落到我身上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I hate the way I eat. I know how weird it looks. I had a surgery to fix my cleft palate when I was a baby, and then a second cleft surgery when I was four, but I still have a hole in the roof of my mouth. And even though I had jaw-alignment surgery a few years ago, I have to chew food in the front of my mouth. I didn't even realize how this looked until I was at a birthday party once, and one of the kids told the mom of the birthday boy he didn't want to sit next to me because I was too messy with all the food crumbs shooting out of my mouth. I know the kid wasn't trying to be mean, but he got in big trouble later, and his mom called my mom that night to apologize. When I got home from the party, I went to the bathroom mirror and started eating a saltine cracker to see what I looked like when I was chewing. The kid was right. I eat like a tortoise, if you've ever seen a tortoise eating. Like some prehistoric swamp thing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我讨厌自己的吃相。我知道那有多么怪异。当我还是个婴儿的时候，我就做过一次修补腭裂的手术，四岁的时候又做了第二次，但是现在我的上颚依然还有一个洞。虽然几年前我动过下巴调整手术，但是我不得不用口腔前半部咀嚼食物。我甚至从来没意识到这样子有多难看，直到有一天我参加一个生日派对，一个孩子告诉过生日的男孩的妈妈，他不想跟我坐在一起，因为我太邋遢了，食物屑不断从我嘴里喷出来。我知道那个男孩并无恶意，但是后来他遇到了大麻烦，那天晚上他的妈妈打电话向我妈妈道歉。我从派对回家，来到浴室的镜子前，开始吃一块苏打饼干，想看看自己吃东西时是什么模样。那个男孩说得对。我吃东西的时候像一只乌龟——如果你见过乌龟吃东西的话。就像某种史前沼泽怪。">查看中文翻译</div>
