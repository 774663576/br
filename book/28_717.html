<div class="line_en">It hurts to live after someone has died. It just does. It can hurt to walk down a hallway or open the fridge. It hurts to put on a pair of socks, to brush your teeth. Food tastes like nothing. Colors go flat. Music hurts, and so do memories. You look at something you'd otherwise find beautiful -- a purple sky at sunset or a playground full of kids -- and it only somehow deepens the loss. Grief is so lonely this way.</div>

<div class="line_en">The day after my father died, we drove to a South Side funeral parlor -- me, my mother, and Craig -- to pick out a casket and plan a service. To make arrangements, as they say in funeral parlors. I don't remember much about our visit there, except for how stunned we were, each of us bricked inside our private grief. Still, as we went through the obscene ritual of shopping for the right box in which to bury our dad, Craig and I managed to have our first and only fight as adult siblings.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="父亲去世后的第二天，我们三个人，我、母亲和克雷格，开车到南城的一家殡仪馆，去选一副棺木并准备葬礼。我们按照殡仪馆的人所说的，做了各种安排。我不记得太多细节，只记得我们都晕乎乎的，每个人都深陷在自己悲伤的泥淖里。但就在我们走那个可憎的程序、选择合适的棺木来安葬我们的父亲时，克雷格和我之间爆发了我们兄妹成年后第一次也是唯一的一次争吵。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It boiled down to this: I wanted to buy the fanciest, most expensive casket in the place, complete with every extra handle and cushion a casket could possibly have. I had no particular rationale for wanting this. It was something to do when there was nothing else to do. The practical, pragmatic part of our upbringing wouldn't allow me to put much stock in the gentle, well-intentioned platitudes people would heap on us a few days later at the funeral. I couldn't be easily comforted by the suggestion that my dad had gone to a better place or was sitting with angels. As I saw it, he just deserved a nice casket.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="事情是这样的。我想买那里最豪华、最昂贵的一副棺木，里面有你能想到的棺木里应该有的所有把手和垫子。我想买这个并没有什么合理依据。只是在没事可做时，那是一件可以做的事。我们接受的讲求实际和实用的家教，让我无法相信几天后葬礼上那些善良好心的人们告诉我们的套话。我不会轻易得到安慰，相信父亲去了一个更好的地方，或者和天使坐在一起。在我看来，他就应该躺在一副好的棺木里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Craig, meanwhile, insisted that Dad would want something basic -- modest and practical and nothing more. It suited our father's personality, he said. Anything else would be too showy.</div>

She was pointing out that we Robinsons had been reduced to a true and ridiculous mess -- unrecognizable with our swollen eyelids and dripping noses, our hurt and strange helplessness here in our own kitchen.

The point was he would have liked it, and so we let ourselves laugh.</div>

<div class="line_en">Losing my dad exacerbated my sense that there was no time to sit around and ponder how my life should go. My father was just fifty-five when he died. Suzanne had been twenty-six. The lesson there was simple: Life is short and not to be wasted. If I died, I didn't want people remembering me for the stacks of legal briefs I'd written or the corporate trademarks I'd helped defend. I felt certain that I had something more to offer the world. It was time to make a move.</div>

<div class="line_en">Still unsure of where I hoped to land, I typed up letters of introduction and sent them to people all over the city of Chicago. I wrote to the heads of foundations, community-oriented nonprofits, and big universities in town, reaching out specifically to their legal departments -- not because I wanted to do legal work, but because I figured they were more likely to respond to my résumé. Thankfully, a number of people did respond, inviting me to have lunch or come in for a meeting, even if they had no job to offer. Over the course of the spring and summer of 1991, I put myself in front of anyone I thought might be able to give me advice. The point was less to find a new job than to widen my understanding of what was possible and how others had gone about it. I was realizing that the next phase of my journey would not simply unfold on its own, that my fancy academic degrees weren't going to automatically lead me to fulfilling work. Finding a career as opposed to a job wouldn't just come from perusing the contact pages of an alumni directory; it required deeper thought and effort. I would need to hustle and learn. And so, again and again, I laid out my professional dilemma for the people I met, quizzing them on what they did and whom they knew. I asked earnest questions about what kind of work might be available to a lawyer who didn't, in fact, want to practice law.</div>

<div class="line_en">One afternoon, I visited the office of a friendly, thoughtful man named Art Sussman, who was the in-house legal counsel for the University of Chicago. It turned out that my mother had once spent about a year working for him as a secretary, taking dictation and maintaining the legal department's files. This was back when I was a sophomore in high school, before she'd taken her job at the bank. Art was surprised to learn that I hadn't ever visited her at work -- that I'd never actually set foot on the university's pristine Gothic campus before now, despite having grown up just a few miles away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天下午，我到阿特·萨斯曼的办公室拜访，他是芝加哥大学的内部法律顾问，他亲切友好、缜密周到。我的母亲曾经给他做过一年的秘书，工作内容是做笔录和管理法务部门的文件。那是我上高二的时候，在她去银行工作之前的事。阿特惊讶于我从来没在母亲工作时来看过她，也就是说，在此之前我从没有踏进过芝加哥大学一尘不染的哥特式校园，尽管我就在离那儿几英里的地方长大。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">If I was honest, there'd been no reason for me to visit the campus. My neighborhood school didn't run field trips there. If there were cultural events open to the community when I was a kid, my family hadn't known about them. We had no friends -- no acquaintances, even -- who were students or alumni. The University of Chicago was an elite school, and to most everyone I knew growing up, elite meant not for us. Its gray stone buildings almost literally had their backs turned to the streets surrounding campus. Driving past, my dad used to roll his eyes at the flocks of students haplessly jaywalking across Ellis Avenue, wondering how it was that such smart people had never learned to properly cross a street.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="老实说，我并没有来这所大学的理由。我社区的学校没有组织过到这里的校外活动。如果在我小时候这里举办过向社区开放的文化活动，我的家人也不会知道。我们没有朋友，甚至也没有熟人在这所学校就读或者是它的校友。芝加哥大学是一所精英学校，对于我成长中认识的几乎所有人而言，精英意味着和我们无关。它那灰色的石头建筑背对着校园周围的街道。开车经过那里时，父亲看着成群的学生在艾利斯大道上乱穿马路，常常翻翻白眼说：“这些头脑聪明的人怎么连好好过马路都没学会。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was an odd power in saying it out loud. I hadn't given the idea much thought before now, but it occurred to me that I'd have made a perfectly fine University of Chicago student, if only the town-gown divide hadn't been so vast -- if I'd known about the school and the school had known about me. Thinking about this, I felt an internal prick, a small subterranean twinge of purpose. The combination of where I came from and what I'd made of myself gave me a certain, possibly meaningful perspective. Being black and from the South Side, I suddenly saw, helped me recognize problems that a man like Art Sussman didn't even realize existed.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I think you should talk to Susan Sher," he told me then, unwittingly setting off what to this day feels like an inspired chain reaction. Susan was about fifteen years older than I was. She'd been a partner at a big law firm but had ultimately bailed out of the corporate world, just as I was hoping to do, though she was still practicing law with the Chicago city government. Susan had slate-gray eyes, the kind of fair skin that belongs on a Victorian queen, and a laugh that often ended with a mischievous snort. She was gently confident and highly accomplished and would become a lifelong friend. "I'd hire you right now," she told me when we finally met. "But you just finished telling me how you don't want to be a lawyer."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我认为你应该去跟苏珊·谢尔谈一谈。”他对我说。现在看来他似乎无意中触发了一个连锁反应，让我结识了一连串能力卓越的人。苏珊大概比我大十五岁，曾经是一家大型律师事务所的合伙人，但是她最终脱离了企业界，那正是我想做的事。不过，她在市政府仍然负责法律事务。苏珊有一双灰蓝色的眼睛，皮肤白皙得像维多利亚女王，笑起来会以一种调皮的响鼻声收尾。她温和自信，极有才干，后来成为我毕生的朋友。“我现在就想雇用你，”我们后来见面时她说，“但你刚刚告诉我你不想再做律师了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Instead, Susan proposed what now seems like another fated introduction, steering me and my résumé toward a new colleague of hers at city hall -- another ship-jumping corporate lawyer with a yen for public service, this one a fellow daughter of the South Side and someone who would end up altering my course in life, not once, but repeatedly. "The person you really need to meet," Susan said, "is Valerie Jarrett."</div>

<div class="line_en">Valerie Jarrett was the newly appointed deputy chief of staff to the mayor of Chicago and had deep connections across the city's African American community. Like Susan, she'd been smart enough to land herself a job in a blue-chip firm after law school and had then been self-aware enough to realize that she wanted out. She'd moved to city hall largely because she was inspired by Harold Washington, who'd been elected mayor in 1983 when I was away at college and was the first African American to hold the office. Washington was a voluble politician with an exuberant spirit. My parents loved him for how he could pepper an otherwise folksy speech with Shakespeare quotes and for the famous, mouth-stuffing vigor with which he ate fried chicken at community events on the South Side. Most important, he had a distaste for the entrenched Democratic machinery that had long governed Chicago, awarding lucrative city contracts to political donors and generally keeping blacks in service to the party but rarely allowing them to advance into official elected roles.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="瓦莱丽·贾勒特是新上任的芝加哥市长办公室副主任，她在芝加哥非洲裔美国人社群中人脉很广。和苏珊一样，她非常优秀，从法学院毕业后在一家实力雄厚的律师事务所找到一份工作，后来她足够有自知之明，意识到自己不想做一行。她到市政厅工作，主要是受到哈罗德·华盛顿的激励。1983年，我还在上大学时，哈罗德当选为芝加哥市市长，是第一个担任这个职位的非洲裔美国人。他是一位口才极佳、充满活力的政治家。我的父母很喜欢他，因为他能用莎士比亚的名言给一场朴实接地气的演讲增添色彩。他还到南城参加社区活动，大吃炸鸡，活力四射。最重要的是，他对长期以来统治芝加哥的根深蒂固的民主党机制深恶痛绝。在这种机制下，政治捐赠者得到了获利丰厚的市政合同，黑人虽然受雇为党派服务，却很少有机会能成长为正式候选人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Building his campaign around reforming the city's political system and better tending to its neglected neighborhoods, Washington won the election by a hair. His style was brassy and his temperament was bold. He was able to eviscerate opponents with his eloquence and intellect. He was a black, brainy superhero. He clashed regularly and fearlessly with the mostly white old-guard members of the city council and was viewed as something of a walking legend, especially among the city's black citizens, who saw his leadership as kindling a larger spirit of progressivism. His vision had been an early inspiration for Barack, who arrived in Chicago to work as an organizer in 1985.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的竞选围绕改革芝加哥市的政治机制以及提升对被忽视的社区的管理展开，并最终以微弱的优势获胜。他做事雷厉风行，性格大胆自信。他用自己的辩才和智慧无情地碾压对手。他无所畏惧地与白人占绝大多数的市议会那些保守的议员频频交战，被视为活着的传奇。他在黑人市民中的威望尤其高，他的领导被认为点燃了进步主义的燎原之火。他的远见卓识在早年激励了贝拉克，所以他会在1985年到芝加哥做社区组织者。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Valerie, too, was drawn by Washington. She was thirty years old when she joined Washington's staff in 1987, at the start of his second term. She was also the mother of a young daughter and soon to be divorced, which made it a deeply inconvenient time to take the sort of pay cut one does when leaving a swishy law firm and landing in city government. And within months of her starting the job, tragedy struck: Harold Washington abruptly had a heart attack and died at his desk, thirty minutes after holding a press conference about low-income housing. In the aftermath, a black alderman was appointed by the city council to take Washington's place, but his tenure was relatively short. In a move many African Americans saw as a swift and demoralizing return to the old white ways of Chicago politics, voters went on to elect Richard M. Daley, the son of a previous mayor, Richard J. Daley, who was broadly considered the godfather of Chicago's famous cronyism.</div>

<div class="line_en">Though she had reservations about the new administration, Valerie had decided to stay on at city hall, moving out of the legal department and directly into Mayor Daley's office. She was glad to be there, as much for the contrast as anything. She described to me how her transition from corporate law into government felt like a relief, an energizing leap out of the super-groomed unreality of high-class law being practiced on the top floors of skyscrapers and into the real world -- the very real world.</div>

<div class="line_en">Chicago's City Hall and County Building is a flat-roofed, eleven-story, gray-granite monolith that occupies an entire block between Clark and LaSalle north of the Loop. Compared with the soaring office towers surrounding it, it's squatty but not without grandeur, featuring tall Corinthian columns out front and giant, echoing lobbies made primarily of marble. The county runs its business out of the east-facing half of the building; the city uses the western half, which houses the mayor and city council members as well as the city clerk. City hall, as I learned on the sweltering summer day I showed up to meet Valerie for a job interview, was both alarmingly and upliftingly packed with people.</div>

<div class="line_en">Valerie had reserved twenty minutes on her schedule to talk to me that day, but our conversation ended up stretching for an hour and a half. A thin, light-skinned African American woman dressed in a beautifully tailored suit, she was soft-spoken and strikingly serene, with a steady brown-eyed gaze and an impressive grasp of how the city functioned. She enjoyed her job but didn't try to gloss over the bureaucratic headaches of government work. Something about her caused me instantly to relax. Years later, Valerie would tell me that to her surprise I'd managed to reverse the standard interview process on her that day -- that I'd given her some basic, helpful information about myself, but otherwise I'd grilled her, wanting to understand every last feeling she had about the work she did and how responsive the mayor was to his employees. I was testing the suitability of the work for me as much as she was testing the suitability of me for the work.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="瓦莱丽原本在她的日程表上安排了二十分钟给我，结果我们的谈话持续了一个半小时。她是非洲裔美国人，身材瘦削，肤色偏浅，穿着一套漂亮合身的西装，说话轻声细语，气质沉着，褐色的眼睛目光坚定，又熟稔市政事务，让人印象深刻。她热爱她的工作，但并不试图粉饰政府工作中令人头疼的官僚作风。她身上的某种东西让我立刻放松下来。多年后，瓦莱丽告诉我，那天让她吃惊的是，我居然在面试中反客为主—我介绍了一些关于自己的基本信息后，就开始盘问她，了解她对自己所做工作的全部感受，以及市长对下属的回应是否积极。与其说是她在评估我是否适合做那份工作，不如说是我在评估那份工作是否适合自己。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There were couples getting married and people registering cars. There were people lodging complaints about potholes, their landlords, their sewer lines, and everything else they felt the city could improve. There were babies in strollers and old ladies in wheelchairs. There were journalists and lobbyists, and also homeless people just looking to get out of the heat. Out on the sidewalk in front of the building, a knot of activists waved signs and shouted chants, though I can't remember what it was they were angry about. What I do know is that I was simultaneously taken aback and completely enthralled by the clunky, controlled chaos of the place. City hall belonged to the people. It had a noisy, gritty immediacy that I never felt at Sidley.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那里有人在结婚，有人在做车辆注册。有人在投诉坑洼的路面、下水道、他们的房东等各种他们认为需要市政帮助解决的问题。那里有躺在手推车里的婴儿，还有坐着轮椅的老妇人。那里有记者和政府说客，还有躲避暑热的无家可归的人。在大楼外的人行道上，一群激进分子挥舞着标语，喊着口号，不过我记不清他们抗议的内容是什么了。我只知道那里复杂而节制的混乱场景既让我感到害怕，也把我完全吸引住了。市政厅属于人民。它有一种喧闹而真实的急迫感，那是我在盛德从未感受过的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I had never been one to hold city hall in high regard. Having grown up black and on the South Side, I had little faith in politics. Politics had traditionally been used against black folks, as a means to keep us isolated and excluded, leaving us undereducated, unemployed, and underpaid. I had grandparents who'd lived through the horror of Jim Crow laws and the humiliation of housing discrimination and basically mistrusted authority of any sort. (Southside, as you may recall, thought that even the dentist was out to get him.) My father, who was a city employee most of his life, had essentially been conscripted into service as a Democratic precinct captain in order to even be considered for promotions at his job. He relished the social aspect of his precinct duties but had always been put off by city hall cronyism.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我对市政厅的评价向来不高。作为一个在南城长大的黑人，我对政治没有什么信心。政治历来都是压迫黑人的，是隔离和排斥我们的手段，让我们无法受到良好教育，找不到工作，所得报酬偏低。我的（外）祖父母经历了吉姆·克劳法 [3]的恐怖和住房歧视的羞辱，对任何权威都不信任。（也许你还记得，我的外祖父认为连牙医都会对他不利。）我的父亲做了一辈子的城市工人，后来被征召担任民主党选区的区长，就是为了在工作上有职位升迁的机会。他很享受自己选区职责中的社会服务的方面，但对于市政厅任人唯亲的行为总是深感厌恶。【注：[3]吉姆·克劳法（Jim Crow laws），泛指1876年至1965年间美国南部各州以及边境各州对有色人种（主要针对非洲裔美国人，但同时也包含其他族群）实行种族隔离制度的法律。这些法律上的种族隔离强制公共设施必须依照种族的不同而隔离使用。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And yet I was suddenly considering a city hall job. I'd winced at the pay cut, but on some visceral level I was just intrigued. I was feeling another twinge, a quiet nudge toward what might be a whole different future from the one I'd planned for. I was almost ready to leap, but for one thing. It wasn't just about me anymore. When Valerie called me a few days later to follow up, I told her I was still thinking the offer over. I then asked a final and probably strange question.

<div class="line_en">I suppose I should back up here, rewinding us through the heavy heat of that summer, through the disorienting haze of those long months after my father died. Barack had flown back to Chicago to be with me for as long as he could around my dad's funeral before returning to finish at Harvard. After graduation in late May, he packed up his things, sold his banana-yellow Datsun, and flew back to Chicago, delivering himself to 7436 South Euclid Avenue and into my arms. I loved him. I felt loved by him. We'd made it almost two years as a long-distance couple, and now, finally, we could be a short-distance couple. It meant that we once again had weekend hours to linger in bed, to read the newspaper and go out for brunch and share every thought we had. We could have Monday night dinners and Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday night dinners, too. We could shop for groceries and fold laundry in front of the TV. On the many evenings when I still got weepy over the loss of my dad, Barack was now there to curl himself around me and kiss the top of my head.</div>

<div class="line_en">Barack had, as he always seemed to, plenty of options. His reputation -- the gushing reports by his law school professors, the New York Times story about his selection as president of the Law Review -- seemed to bring a flood of opportunity. The University of Chicago offered him an unpaid fellowship that came with a small office for the year, the idea being that he'd write his book there and maybe eventually sign on to teach as an adjunct professor at the law school. My colleagues at Sidley &amp; Austin, still hoping Barack would come work full-time at the firm, provided him with a desk to use during the eight or so weeks leading up to his bar exam in July. He was now also considering taking a job at Davis, Miner, Barnhill &amp; Galland, a small public interest firm that did civil rights and fair housing work and whose attorneys had been aligned closely with Harold Washington, which was a huge draw for Barack.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一直以来，贝拉克都拥有很多选择。他的名声—法学院教授对他的溢美之词，《纽约时报》对他当选《哈佛法律评论》主席的报道—给他带来了许多机会。芝加哥大学为他提供了一个不领薪水的研究员职位，以及一间小办公室，让他在那里完成书稿，并希望他最终能留在芝加哥大学法学院担任教职。我在盛德的同事仍然希望贝拉克能在事务所全职工作，还给他提供了一张办公桌，当时距离7月司法考试还有八周左右，他可以在那段时间里使用。而他那时还在考虑加入一家名叫戴维斯·迈纳·巴恩希尔&amp;加朗的小型公益律师事务所。这家律师事务所受理公民权利和公平住房领域的事务，里面的律师和哈罗德·华盛顿有密切合作，这对贝拉克有很大吸引力。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Barack was relieved to be done with law school, eager to get out of the abstract realm of academia and into work that felt more engaging and real.

<div class="line_en">There's something innately bolstering about a person who sees his opportunities as endless, who doesn't waste time or energy questioning whether they will ever dry up. Barack had worked hard and dutifully for everything he was now being given, but he wasn't notching achievements or measuring his progress against that of others, as so many people I knew did -- as I sometimes did myself. He seemed, at times, beautifully oblivious to the giant rat race of life and all the material things a thirtysomething lawyer was supposed to be going after, from a car that wasn't embarrassing to a house with a yard in the suburbs or a swank condo in the Loop. I'd observed this quality in him before, but now that we were living together and I was considering making the first real swerve of my life, I came to value it even more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一个知道自己有无穷无尽的机会的人底气是很足的，他从不用浪费时间和精力去想自己的机会是否会枯竭。贝拉克在所有交付给他的事情上都努力而负责，但和我认识的许多人不同，他从不以别人为标杆来衡量自己的成就、自己的进步，而我自己有时就会那么做。他有时似乎完全无视人生赛场上的激烈竞争，以及一个三十几岁的律师应该追求的所有物质上的东西，比如一辆不那么寒酸的车、郊区一栋带庭院的房子或者卢普区一套值得炫耀的公寓。我以前就曾注意到他身上的这种品质，而当时我们住在了一起，在我正考虑做出自己人生中第一次真正的改变时，我愈加珍视这种品质。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In a nutshell, Barack believed and trusted when others did not. He had a simple, buoying faith that if you stuck to your principles, things would work out. I'd had so many careful, sensible conversations at this point, with so many people, about how to extract myself from a career in which, by all outward measures, I was flourishing. Again and again, I'd read the caution and concern on so many faces when I spoke of having loans to pay off, of not yet having managed to buy a house. I couldn't help but think about how my father had kept his aims deliberately modest, avoiding every risk in order to give us constancy at home. I still walked around with my mother's advice ringing in my ear: Make the money first and worry about your happiness later. Compounding my anxiety was the one deep longing that far outmatched any material wish: I knew I wanted to have children, sooner rather than later. And how would that work if I abruptly started over in a brand-new field?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="简言之，当其他人持怀疑和谨慎的态度时，贝拉克会相信你并对你有信心。他怀有一个简单而令人鼓舞的信念，那就是，只要你坚持自己的原则，一切问题都会迎刃而解。那个时候，我已经和许多人进行了许多次审慎而理智的谈话，探讨我如何从一个以所有外在标准衡量都前程似锦的事业中抽身。当我谈到自己还有贷款要还、还没有买房时，我一次又一次地从许多张脸上读到了慎重和关切。我不由得想起我的父亲，他刻意地放低自己的目标，避开每一个风险，就为了让我们有一个稳定的家庭环境。母亲的话也在耳边回响：“先挣钱，然后再考虑成就感的事。”另外，加重我焦虑感的还有我内心的一个深深的渴望，它凌驾于任何物质愿望之上，那就是，我想要生孩子，而且想尽早。如果我突然转到一个全新的领域从零做起，这件事要怎么办呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Barack, when he showed up back in Chicago, became a kind of soothing antidote. He absorbed my worries, listened as I ticked off every financial obligation I had, and affirmed that he, too, was excited to have children. He acknowledged that there was no way we could predict how exactly we'd manage things, given that neither of us wanted to be locked into the comfortable predictability of a lawyer's life. But the bottom line was that we were far from poor and our future was promising, maybe even more promising for the fact that it couldn't easily be planned.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="贝拉克回到芝加哥后成了安抚我的一剂特效药。他化解我的种种忧虑，听我列举每一项债务，告诉我他也非常愿意要孩子。他承认，因为我们两个都不愿意被困在舒适而有保障的律师工作中，我们没有办法预测未来的情况。但底线是，我们肯定不会变成穷人，我们的未来大有希望，可能正因为它没办法轻易规划，所以更加让人期待。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A word now about the bar exam: It's a necessary chore, a rite of passage for any just-hatched lawyer wishing to practice, and though the content and structure of the test itself vary somewhat from state to state, the experience of taking it -- a two-day, twelve-hour exam meant to prove your knowledge of everything from contract law to arcane rules about secured transactions -- is pretty much universally recognized as hellish. Just as Barack was intending to, I had sat for the Illinois bar exam three years earlier, the summer after finishing up at Harvard, submitting myself beforehand to what was supposed to be a self-disciplined two months of logging hours as a first-year associate at Sidley while also taking a bar review class and pushing myself through a dauntingly fat book of practice tests.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="再来说一说司法考试的事。它是任何初出茅庐的律师在执业前必须迈过的一道门槛，就像是一个成人礼。尽管各州考试的内容和结构有所不同，但是参加这个考试被公认为梦魇般的经历。考试共持续两天，总共十二个小时，从合同法到关于担保交易的艰深法则，考察你掌握的所有知识。贝拉克很快就要参加这个考试，而我是在三年前参加的伊利诺伊州司法考试。那是从哈佛毕业后的夏天，我主动提前两个月进入盛德工作，这被认为是刚参加工作的律师上进的表现。与此同时，我还参加了一个司法考试复习班，硬着头皮啃一本厚得像砖头一样的模考练习册。">查看中文翻译</div>

I asked if there was an envelope in there for me. There was. Was it a letter from the Illinois State Bar Association? Why, yes, that's what it said on the envelope.

If anything, I generally overdid things, especially when it came to preparing for a big moment or test, but this one I'd let slip by. I think now that it was a by-product of the disinterest I'd felt all through law school, burned out as I was on being a student and bored by subjects that struck me as esoteric and far removed from real life. I wanted to be around people and not books, which is why the best part of law school for me had been volunteering at the school's Legal Aid Bureau, where I could help someone get a Social Security check or stand up to an out-of-line landlord.</div>

<div class="line_en">Several years later, though, the memory was causing me to regard Barack with extra curiosity. He was attending bar review classes and carrying around his own bar review books, and yet didn't seem to be cracking them as often as I thought maybe he should -- as I would, anyway, knowing what I knew now. But I wasn't going to nag him or even offer myself as an example of what could go wrong. We were built so differently, he and I. For one thing, Barack's head was an overpacked suitcase of information, a mainframe from which he could seemingly pull disparate bits of data at will. I called him "the fact guy," for how he seemed to have a statistic to match every little twist in a conversation. His memory seemed not-quite-but-almost photographic. The truth was, I wasn't worried about whether he'd pass the bar and, somewhat annoyingly, neither was he.</div>

He reached for my hand and said that as much as he loved me with his whole being, he still didn't really see the point. Instantly, I felt the blood rise in my cheeks.

<div class="line_en">Barack looked at me playfully. He'd baited me. It had all been a ruse. It took me a second to dismantle my anger and slide into joyful shock. He'd riled me up because this was the very last time he would invoke his inane marriage argument, ever again, as long as we both should live. The case was closed. He dropped to one knee then and with an emotional hitch in his voice asked sincerely if I'd please do him the honor of marrying him. Later, I'd learn that he'd already gone to both my mother and my brother to ask for their approval ahead of time. When I said yes, it seemed that every person in the whole restaurant started to clap.</div>

<div class="line_en">I did this for a couple of reasons. For one, I liked Valerie. I was impressed by her, and whether or not I ended up taking the job, I was excited to get to know her better. I knew that Barack would be impressed, too. More important, though, I wanted him to hear Valerie's story. Like Barack, she'd spent part of her childhood in a different country -- in her case, Iran, where her father had been a doctor at a hospital -- and returned to the United States for her schooling, giving her the same kind of clear-eyed perspective I saw in Barack. Barack had concerns about my working at city hall. Like Valerie, he'd been inspired by the leadership of Harold Washington when he was mayor, but felt decidedly less affinity for the old-school establishment represented by Richard M. Daley. It was the community organizer in him: Even while Washington was in office, he'd had to battle relentlessly and sometimes fruitlessly with the city in order to get even the smallest bit of support for grassroots projects. Though he'd been nothing but encouraging about my job prospects, I think he was quietly worried I might end up disillusioned or disempowered working under Daley.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我这么做有几个原因。首先，我喜欢瓦莱丽，很钦佩她，所以不管最后我会不会接受这份工作，我都愿意与她有更深入的交往。我知道贝拉克也一定会钦佩她。最重要的是，我想让他听听瓦莱丽的故事。和贝拉克一样，她小时候也在国外生活过一段时间，在伊朗，她的父亲曾在那里的一家医院做医生。后来她回到美国上学，这段经历让她拥有了看待世界的广阔视角，我在贝拉克身上也看到了同样的特质。贝拉克对我去市政厅工作感到担忧。和瓦莱丽一样，哈罗德·华盛顿任市长时，贝拉克也曾受到他领袖力量的激励，但是贝拉克对理查德·M。戴里所代表的保守政府没有多少好感。他曾经做过社区组织者。即使在哈罗德·华盛顿担任市长期间，他为了给基层项目争取到一丁点儿支持，也要跟市政府进行不懈的有时也是徒劳的斗争。虽然他全力支持我选择自己喜欢的工作，但我觉得他内心是有隐忧的，他担心我在戴里手下工作后，理想会幻灭，自信心会被消磨掉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Valerie was the right person to address any concerns. She'd rearranged her entire life in order to work for Washington and then lost him almost immediately. The void that followed Washington's death offered a kind of cautionary tale for the future, one I'd eventually find myself trying to explain to people across America: In Chicago, we'd made the mistake of putting all our hopes for reform on the shoulders of one person without building the political apparatus to support his vision. Voters, especially liberal and black voters, viewed Washington as a kind of golden savior, a symbol, the man who could change everything. He'd carried the load admirably, inspiring people like Barack and Valerie to move out of the private sector and into community work and public service. But when Harold Washington died, most of the energy he'd generated did, too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="瓦莱丽是帮忙消除所有担忧的不二人选。她之前为了追随哈罗德·华盛顿，彻底改变了自己的生活，而紧接着就失去了他。哈罗德去世后留下的空白也为未来提供了一个警示，后来我自己也向全国人民反复申述这一点：在芝加哥，我们犯了一个错误，就是把改革的所有希望寄托在一个人身上，而没有建立起政治组织来支持他的愿景。选民们，尤其是自由选民和黑人选民，将哈罗德视为救世主，一个象征，一个能改变一切的人。他也令人钦佩地挑起这一重担，激励了像贝拉克和瓦莱丽这样的人离开私营企业，进入社区公共服务和公共事业领域工作。但是在哈罗德·华盛顿去世后，他所激发的能量也随之消散了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Valerie's decision to stay on with the mayor's office had required some thought, but she explained to us why she felt it was the right choice. She described feeling supported by Daley and knowing that she was being useful to the city. Her loyalty, she said, had been to Harold Washington's principles more than to the man himself. Inspiration on its own was shallow; you had to back it up with hard work. This idea resonated with both me and Barack, and inside that one dinner I felt as if something had been cemented: Valerie Jarrett was now a part of our lives. Without our ever discussing it, it seemed almost as if the three of us had somehow agreed to carry one another a good long way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="瓦莱丽也是经过思考之后，才决定继续留在市长办公室工作的。她向我们解释了为什么她认为这是正确的选择。她说感觉戴里是支持她的工作的，她也能为这个城市做些事情。她说，她更多是忠于哈罗德·华盛顿的原则，而不是他这个人。激励本身是肤浅的，你必须用艰苦的工作来支撑它。这个观点引起了我和贝拉克的共鸣，在那次晚餐中，我感觉有一件事已经确定，那就是，瓦莱丽·贾勒特是我们生活的一部分了。虽然我们没有明确讨论，但是我们三个人似乎已经达成一致，要携手互助，走很长一段路。">查看中文翻译</div>

I felt Nairobi's foreignness -- or really, my own foreignness in relation to it -- immediately, even in the first strains of morning. It's a sensation I've come to love as I've traveled more, the way a new place signals itself instantly and without pretense. The air has a different weight from what you're used to; it carries smells you can't quite identify, a faint whiff of wood smoke or diesel fuel, maybe, or the sweetness of something blooming in the trees. The same sun comes up, but looking slightly different from what you know.</div>

<div class="line_en">Barack's half sister Auma met us at the airport, greeting us both warmly. The two of them had met only a handful of times, beginning six years earlier when Auma had visited Chicago, but they had a close bond. Auma is a year older than Barack. Her mother, Grace Kezia, had been pregnant with Auma when Barack Obama Sr. left Nairobi to study in Hawaii in 1959. (They also had a son, Abongo, who was a toddler at the time.) After he returned to Kenya in the mid-1960s, Barack senior and Kezia went on to have two more children together.</div>

Arriving in Kenya, I was so tired from the travel I could barely make conversation, but riding into the city in the backseat of Auma's rattletrap Volkswagen Bug, I took note of how the quickness of her smile was just like Barack's, how the curve of her head also resembled his. Auma also clearly had inherited the family brains: She'd been raised in Kenya and returned there often, but she'd gone to college in Germany and was still living there, studying for a PhD. She was fluent in English, German, Swahili, and her family's local language, called Luo. Like us, she was just here for a visit.</div>

<div class="line_en">Auma had arranged for me and Barack to stay in a friend's empty apartment, a spartan one-bedroom in a nondescript cinder-block building that had been painted bright pink. For the first couple of days, we were so zonked by jet lag it felt as if we were moving at half speed. Or maybe it was just the pace of Nairobi, which ran on an entirely different logic than Chicago did, its roads and British-style roundabouts clogged by a mix of pedestrians, bikers, cars, and matatus -- the tottering, informal jitney-like buses that could be seen everywhere, painted brightly with murals and tributes to God, their roofs piled high with strapped-on luggage, so crowded that passengers sometimes just rode along, clinging precariously to the exterior.</div>

<div class="line_en">Barack was more at home in Nairobi than I was, having been there once before. I moved with the awkwardness of a tourist, aware that we were outsiders, even with our black skin. People sometimes stared at us on the street. I hadn't been expecting to fit right in, obviously, but I think I arrived there naively believing I'd feel some visceral connection to the continent I'd grown up thinking of as a sort of mythic motherland, as if going there would bestow on me some feeling of completeness. But Africa, of course, owed us nothing. It's a curious thing to realize, the in-betweenness one feels being African American in Africa. It gave me a hard-to-explain feeling of sadness, a sense of being unrooted in both lands.</div>

But we did fight. And for better or worse, I tend to yell when I'm angry. When something sets me off, the feeling can be intensely physical, a kind of fireball running up my spine and exploding with such force that I sometimes later don't remember what I said in the moment. Barack, meanwhile, tends to remain cool and rational, his words coming in an eloquent (and therefore irritating) cascade. It's taken us time -- years -- to understand that this is just how each of us is built, that we are each the sum total of our respective genetic codes as well as everything installed in us by our parents and their parents before them.

We met Auma at a downtown train station, and the three of us boarded a passenger train with slatted windows to head west out of the city and toward the Obama family's ancestral home. Sitting by a window in a cabin packed with Kenyans, some of whom were traveling with live chickens in baskets, others with hefty pieces of furniture they'd bought in the city, I was again struck by how strange my girl-from-Chicago, lawyer-at-a-desk life had suddenly become -- how this man sitting next to me had shown up at my office one day with his weird name and quixotic smile and brilliantly upended everything. I sat glued to the window as the sprawling community of Kibera, the largest urban slum in Africa, streamed past, showing us its low-slung shanties with corrugated-tin roofs, its muddy roads and open sewers, and a kind of poverty I'd never seen before nor could hardly have imagined.</div>

I remember being sweaty and thirsty as we walked the last bit of the way to Barack's grandmother's compound, to the well-kept concrete home where she'd lived for years, farming an adjacent vegetable patch and tending several cows. Granny Sarah, they called her. She was a short, wide-built lady with wise eyes and a crinkling smile. She spoke no English, only Luo, and expressed delight that we'd come all this way to see her. Next to her, I felt very tall. She studied me with an extra, bemused curiosity, as if trying to place where I came from and how precisely I'd landed on her doorstep.

<div class="line_en">I laughed and explained, with Auma's help, that I was black through and through, basically as black as we come in America.</div>

<div class="line_en">Granny Sarah found this funny. She seemed to find everything funny, teasing Barack for not being able to speak her language. I was bowled over by her easy joy. As evening fell, she butchered us a chicken and made us a stew, which she served with a cornmeal mush called ugali. All the while, neighbors and relatives popped in to say hello to the younger Obamas and to congratulate us on our engagement. I gobbled the food gratefully as the sun dropped and night settled over the village, which had no electricity, leaving a bright spray of stars overhead. That I was in this place seemed like a little miracle. I was sharing a rudimentary bedroom with Barack, listening to the stereo sound of crickets in the cornfields all around us, the rustle of animals we couldn't see. I remember feeling awed by the scope of land and sky around me and at the same time snug and protected inside that tiny home. I had a new job, a fiancé, and an expanded family -- an approving Kenyan granny, even. It was true: I'd been flung out of my world, and for the moment it was all good.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="萨拉奶奶觉得这很有意思。她似乎觉得什么都很有意思，还取笑贝拉克不会说她的语言。我被她的轻松快乐吸引了。到了傍晚，她杀了一只鸡为我们做了一道炖菜，我们配上一种叫乌伽黎的玉米糊一起吃。其间有邻居和亲戚过来问候年轻的奥巴马姐弟，祝贺我们订婚。我感激地狼吞虎咽，不久后太阳落山了，夜色开始笼罩村庄，这里没有电，我们能看到头上夜空的点点繁星。来到这个地方让我感觉像是一个奇迹。我和贝拉克睡在一间简陋的卧室里，听着周围玉米地里传来蟋蟀的叫声，还有我们看不到的动物的窸窣声，在这个小屋里我们感觉舒适而安全。我还记得身处这片广阔的土地，内心升起敬畏感。我有一份新工作、一个未婚夫、一个大家族，甚至还有一个认可我们亲事的生活在肯尼亚的祖母。这是真实的：我被抛出了我自己的世界，而目前感觉一切都好。">查看中文翻译</div>
