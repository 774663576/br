Personally, I had a lot of work to do. As for Hans, I think he was doing his best to avoid me.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a man a year older than himself -- a German Jew named Erik Vandenburg -- who taught him to play the accordion. The two of them gradually became friends due to the fact that neither of them was terribly interested in fighting. They preferred rolling cigarettes to rolling in snow and mud. They preferred shooting craps to shooting bullets. A firm friendship was built on gambling, smoking, and music, not to mention a shared desire for survival. The only trouble with this was that Erik Vandenburg would later be found in several pieces on a grassy hill. His eyes were open and his wedding ring was stolen. I shoveled up his soul with the rest of them and we drifted away. The horizon was the color of milk. Cold and fresh. Poured out among the bodies.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="教会他拉手风琴的人叫埃里克·范登堡，是个比他大一岁的德国犹太人。他们俩渐渐成了好朋友，这大概是因为两人都不喜欢战斗。比起在雪地和泥地里翻滚，他们更喜欢卷香烟。比起发射子弹，他们更喜欢掷骰子。于是，他们俩在赌博、抽烟、音乐，以及共同的求生欲望的基础上建立起了牢固的友谊。唯一的问题是不久之后，埃里克·范登堡在一座杂草丛生的山丘上被打成了筛子。他双眼圆睁，手上的婚戒被偷走了。我把他的灵魂收拢起来铲走，然后我们便缓缓地离开。那一天的地平线现出牛奶的颜色，冰冷而新鲜的乳白色倾泻在遍地的尸体上。">查看中文翻译</div>
