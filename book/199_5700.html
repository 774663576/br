<div class="line_en">Wormtail approached Harry, who scrambled to find his feet, to support his own weight before the ropes were untied. Wormtail raised his new silver hand, pulled out the wad of material gagging Harry, and then, with one swipe, cut through the bonds tying Harry to the gravestone.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a split second, perhaps, when Harry might have considered running for it, but his injured leg shook under him as he stood on the overgrown grave, as the Death Eaters closed ranks, forming a tighter circle around him and Voldemort, so that the gaps where the missing Death Eaters should have stood were filled. Wormtail walked out of the circle to the place where Cedric's body lay and returned with Harry's wand, which he thrust roughly into Harry's hand without looking at him. Then Wormtail resumed his place in the circle of watching Death Eaters.</div>

<div class="line_en">At these words Harry remembered, as though from a former life, the dueling club at Hogwarts he had attended briefly two years ago… All he had learned there was the Disarming Spell, "Expelliarmus"… and what use would it be to deprive Voldemort of his wand, even if he could, when he was surrounded by Death Eaters, outnumbered by at least thirty to one? He had never learned anything that could possibly fit him for this. He knew he was facing the thing against which Moody had always warned… the unblockable Avada Kedavra curse -- and Voldemort was right -- his mother was not here to die for him this time… He was quite unprotected…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="听了这话，哈利想起两年前他曾参加过一个短期的决斗俱乐部，那好像是上辈子的事一样…他在那里只学到了“除你武器”这样的缴械咒…可即使他能够夺走伏地魔的魔杖，又有什么用呢？周围都是食死徒，与他的比例至少是三十比一。他没有学过在这里用得上的东西。他知道他面临的是穆迪经常警告要防范的咒语…不可阻拦的阿瓦达索命咒。伏地魔说对了，这一次没有妈妈来拼死救他了…他完全没有保护。">查看中文翻译</div>

The pain was so intense, so all-consuming, that he no longer knew where he was… White-hot knives were piercing every inch of his skin, his head was surely going to burst with pain, he was screaming more loudly than he'd ever screamed in his life -</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="这几个字从哈利嘴里迸出来，在墓地上空回响，梦幻的状态突然消失了，就像被当头浇了一盆凉水似的——钻心咒在他浑身留下的疼痛又全部回来了——他重新意识到他在哪里，面前是什么…">查看中文翻译</div>

Harry, following the beam with his astonished gaze, saw that Voldemort's long white fingers too were gripping a wand that was shaking and vibrating.</div>

<div class="line_en">More screams of pain from the wand… and then something else emerged from its tip… the dense shadow of a second head, quickly followed by arms and torso… an old man Harry had seen only in a dream was now pushing himself out of the end of the wand just as Cedric had done… and his ghost, or his shadow, or whatever it was, fell next to Cedric's, and surveyed Harry and Voldemort, and the golden web, and the connected wands, with mild surprise, leaning on his walking stick…</div>
