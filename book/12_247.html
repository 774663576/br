<div class="line_en">The hobbits stood now on the brink of a tall cliff, bare and bleak, its feet wrapped in mist; and behind them rose the broken highlands crowned with drifting cloud. A chill wind blew from the East. Night was gathering over the shapeless lands before them; the sickly green of them was fading to a sullen brown. Far away to the right the Anduin, that had gleamed fitfully in sun-breaks during the day, was now hidden in shadow. But their eyes did not look beyond the River, back to Gondor, to their friends, to the lands of Men. South and east they stared to where, at the edge of the oncoming night, a dark line hung, like distant mountains of motionless smoke. Every now and again a tiny red gleam far away flickered upwards on the rim of earth and sky.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈比人此时站在一座高耸悬崖旁，上面光秃秃得寸草不生，底下则被包围在迷雾中，在悬崖之后则可以看见穿插在云雾之间的山丘。前方的大地则已经渐渐被夜色所笼罩，原先看来恶心的绿色现在则变成奄奄一息的褐色。右方极远之处则是安都因，本来它在太阳底下反射着光芒，现在则被阴影给掩盖。但他们的目光并没有回到刚铎、回到朋友和人类的土地之上，他们继续的往南边、往东边看着夜色从远方缓缓扑来，仿佛是地平线彼端的山脉一样飘忽不定。在极远的地方，偶尔会有微弱的红色火芒窜起，随即又消失。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was the third evening since they had fled from the Company, as far as they could tell: they had almost lost count of the hours during which they had climbed and laboured among the barren slopes and stones of the Emyn Muil, sometimes retracing their steps because they could find no way forward, sometimes discovering that they had wandered in a circle back to where they had been hours before. Yet on the whole they had worked steadily eastward, keeping as near as they could find a way to the outer edge of this strange twisted knot of hills. But always they found its outward faces sheer, high and impassable, frowning over the plain below; beyond its tumbled skirts lay livid festering marshes where nothing moved and not even a bird was to be seen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是他们离开远征队的第三天晚上，不过，这也是有些勉强的推算，自从他们在爱明莫尔的崎岖地形中跋涉以来，几乎完全忘记到底过了多少小时。这段时间中，有时他们会遇上死路，必须回头，有时则会发现自己原来都在绕圈子。但是，基本上他们还是在稳定地前进，尽可能的沿着山脉的边缘走。他们经常会遇到无法通行的断崖绝壁，俯瞰着底下的平原，四周则是鸟兽绝迹的荒凉地形。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes, I can smell it," said Frodo, but he did not move, and his eyes remained fixed, staring out towards the dark line and the flickering flame. "Mordor!" he muttered under his breath. "If I must go there, I wish I could come there quickly and make an end!" He shuddered. The wind was chilly and yet heavy with an odour of cold decay. "Well," he said, at last withdrawing his eyes, "we cannot stay here all night, fix or no fix. We must find a more sheltered spot, and camp once more; and perhaps another day will show us a path."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，我闻得到，”佛罗多说，但他依旧站着不动，双眼搜寻着天际闪烁的火焰。“魔多！”他压低声音呢喃着：“如果我必须去那边，我希望可以快点了结！”他打了个寒颤。晚风不只寒冷，更夹杂着腐败的味道。“好吧，”他最后终于将目光移开。“不管有没有路，我们都不能在这边过夜，必须找个比较有掩蔽的地方，在那边扎营，或许第二天可以找到别的路。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Can you smell it?" He sniffed at the wind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这真是矛盾哪！”山姆说：“这世界上只有一个我们听过，但又绝不想要靠近的地方，现在我们偏偏朝着那个方向走！而且我们竟然还没办法走过去，看来我们是走错方向了。我们没办法从悬崖上下去，就算下去了，我打赌底下也是个寸步难行的沼泽。呸！你闻得到吗？”他迎着风嗅了嗅。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Only those, what d'you call 'em, lembas, Mr. Frodo. A fair supply. But they are better than naught, by a long bite. I never thought, though, when I first set tooth in them, that I should ever come to wish for a change. But I do now: a bit of plain bread, and a mug -- aye, half a mug -- of beer would go down proper. I've lugged my cooking-gear all the way from the last camp, and what use has it been? Naught to make a fire with, for a start; and naught to cook, not even grass!"</div>

<div class="line_en">"I wonder," said Frodo. "It's my doom, I think, to go to that Shadow yonder, so that a way will be found. But will good or evil show it to me? What hope we had was in speed. Delay plays into the Enemy's hands -- and here I am: delayed. Is it the will of the Dark Tower that steers us? All my choices have proved ill. I should have left the Company long before, and come down from the North, east of the River and of the Emyn Muil, and so over the hard of Battle Plain to the passes of Mordor. But now it isn't possible for you and me alone to find a way back, and the Orcs are prowling on the east bank. Every day that passes is a precious day lost. I am tired, Sam. I don't know what is to be done. What food have we got left?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Sometimes in the silence of that barren country they fancied that they heard faint sounds behind them, a stone falling, or the imagined step of flapping feet on the rock. But if they halted and stood still listening, they heard no more, nothing but the wind sighing over the edges of the stones -- yet even that reminded them of breath softly hissing through sharp teeth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有时，在这块荒地的寂静中，他们会幻想自己听见身后传来什么声音，可能是石头落下的声音，或是有蹼的脚踩在地上的虚幻之声；但如果他们停下来，仔细地侧耳倾听，就什么都听不见了，只剩下风吹过岩石间的微弱叹息，每每让他们联想到轻风吹过锐利尖齿的声音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"So do I," said Frodo; "but he's not my chief trouble. I wish we could get away from these hills! I hate them. I feel all naked on the east side, stuck up here with nothing but the dead flats between me and that Shadow yonder. There's an Eye in it. Come on! We've got to get down today somehow."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我也是，”佛罗多说：“但他并非是我们主要的问题。我希望可以离开这块丘陵地！我讨厌这个地方。在这边，我觉得面对东方一点掩护也没有，只有那块死寂的平原，魔眼还虎视眈眈地在那边。来吧！今天一定得找到办法下去才行。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">All that day the outer ridge of the Emyn Muil had been bending gradually northward, as they struggled on. Along its brink there now stretched a wide tumbled flat of scored and weathered rock, cut every now and again by trench-like gullies that sloped steeply down to deep notches in the cliff-face. To find a path in these clefts, which were becoming deeper and more frequent, Frodo and Sam were driven to their left, well away from the edge, and they did not notice that for several miles they had been going slowly but steadily downhill: the cliff-top was sinking towards the level of the lowlands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们这一整天都跋涉在爱明莫尔的外缘，看着地形逐渐地往北方转。在高地的边缘有着连绵不断的平地和许多块岩石，偶尔还被如同壕沟的地堑切断，在陡峭的悬崖上留下一道道的痕迹。为了要在这些险阻之间找到出路，佛罗多和山姆被迫往左边靠，反而离高地的边缘越来越远。他们并没有注意到地势已经逐渐下倾了好几哩，悬崖顶的高度开始慢慢地向低地看齐。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But that day wore on, and when afternoon faded towards evening they were still scrambling along the ridge and had found no way of escape.</div>

<div class="line_en">At last they were brought to a halt. The ridge took a sharper bend northward and was gashed by a deeper ravine. On the further side it reared up again, many fathoms at a single leap: a great grey cliff loomed before them, cut sheer down as if by a knife stroke. They could go no further forwards, and must turn now either west or east. But west would lead them only into more labour and delay, back towards the heart of the hills; east would take them to the outer precipice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们终于停了下来，眼前的斜坡猛然往北转，又被一道深沟给切割开来；在另外一边这道深沟又持续往上升，赫然成为一道直上直下，似乎被刀子切割过的峭壁。眼看着他们无法继续前进，只得向西或是向东转，但如果往西方走，只会让他们花上更多的精神和功夫，又回到群山之间，东方则是只能走到悬崖边缘。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The cleft was longer and deeper than it seemed. Some way down they found a few gnarled and stunted trees, the first they had seen for days: twisted birch for the most part, with here and there a fir-tree. Many were dead and gaunt, bitten to the core by the eastern winds. Once in milder days there must have been a fair thicket in the ravine, but now, after some fifty yards, the trees came to an end, though old broken stumps straggled on almost to the cliff's brink. The bottom of the gully, which lay along the edge of a rock-fault, was rough with broken stone and slanted steeply down. When they came at last to the end of it, Frodo stooped and leaned out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这深沟果然比看起来的要高、要深很多。往下走去不远的地方，他们发现了几丛纠结干枯的老树，这是他们多日以来第一次看到的大型植物，大部分是桦树，中间也夹杂着几株杉木，许多树已经死掉了，在冷冽东风的吹拂下几乎完全萎缩。或许在比较好的天候下，这里原先是一丛丛茂盛的植物，但是，在走不到五十码之后，四周的环境又变得一片荒芜，只有一株断裂的老树桩挣扎着耸立在山崖的边缘。这道深沟一路延伸出去，化成一道插满了断裂岩石，往下垂去的陡坡。两人好不容易来到深沟的边缘，佛罗多低头往下看去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sam knelt beside him and peered reluctantly over the edge. Then he glanced up at the great cliff rising up, away on their left. "Easier!" he grunted. "Well, I suppose it's always easier getting down than up. Those as can't fly can jump!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆在他旁边单膝跪地，不情愿地往下看。然后他又抬头看看左边那直入云霄的峭壁。“是简单多了啊！”他嘟哝着：“好吧！我想往下永远都会比往上要容易。不会飞，总会跳吧！”">查看中文翻译</div>

There was a distant mutter of thunder borne on the rising breeze. Frodo sniffed the air and looked up doubtfully at the sky. He strapped his belt outside his cloak and tightened it, and settled his light pack on his back; then he stepped towards the edge. "I'm going to try it," he said.</div>

Then he lay on the ground, leaning out and looking down; but the light seemed to be fading quickly, although the sun had not yet set. "I think we could manage this," he said presently.

<div class="line_en">The hurrying darkness, now gathering great speed, rushed up from the East and swallowed the sky. There was a dry splitting crack of thunder right overhead. Searing lightning smote down into the hills. Then came a blast of savage wind, and with it, mingling with its roar, there came a high shrill shriek. The hobbits had heard just such a cry far away in the Marish as they fled from Hobbiton, and even there in the woods of the Shire it had frozen their blood. Out here in the waste its terror was far greater: it pierced them with cold blades of horror and despair, stopping heart and breath. Sam fell flat on his face. Involuntarily Frodo loosed his hold and put his hands over his head and ears. He swayed, slipped, and slithered downwards with a wailing cry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="急速奔驰而来的黑暗从东方急遽地靠近，将整个天空都吞没，正上方还传来了旱雷的声音，闪电直击而下落在山丘中。紧接着而来的是一阵狂风，混杂在其中的却是一声凄厉的尖叫。许久以前，当他们从哈比屯逃出的时候，就听过这样的叫声；即使当时他们还身在哈比屯的森林中，这声音也让他们血液为之冻结。在这寸草不生的荒地中，这叫声的效果尤其骇人，它像是恐惧与绝望所凝结成的冰冷刀刃，恶狠狠地插入两人胸口，让他们无法呼吸。山姆立刻趴了下来，佛罗多不由自主地松开手，遮住耳朵和脑袋。他摇晃了几下，脚步一个不稳，就惨叫着跌了下去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"What can I do, Mr. Frodo? What can I do?" shouted Sam, leaning out dangerously far. Why could not his master see? It was dim, certainly, but not as dark as all that.

<div class="line_en">Frodo was calling with a weak voice. He was not actually very far away. He had slid and not fallen, and had come up with a jolt to his feet on a wider ledge not many yards lower down. Fortunately the rock-face at this point leaned well back and the wind had pressed him against the cliff, so that he had not toppled over. He steadied himself a little, laying his face against the cold stone, feeling his heart pounding. But either the darkness had grown complete, or else his eyes had lost their sight. All was black about him. He wondered if he had been struck blind. He took a deep breath.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佛罗多的声音很微弱。他事实上并没有距离山姆很远。他刚刚只是滑了一跤，并没有摔落悬崖，几乎立刻就在底下的另一块突出的地方找到了站立之处。很幸运的，这里的崖壁是倾斜的，之前的狂风正好让他结结实实地趴在崖壁上，所以才没有跌下去。他稳住了身形，将脸贴在冰冷的石头上，感觉着自己的心跳。但不知是由于黑暗太过浓密，还是他失去了视力，眼前只有一片漆黑。他怀疑自己是否瞎掉了，于是深吸一口气，想让自己冷静下来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Quickly Sam unslung his pack and rummaged in it. There indeed at the bottom was a coil of the silken-grey rope made by the folk of Lórien. He cast an end to his master. The darkness seemed to lift from Frodo's eyes, or else his sight was returning. He could see the grey line as it came dangling down, and he thought it had a faint silver sheen. Now that he had some point in the darkness to fix his eyes on, he felt less giddy. Leaning his weight forward, he made the end fast round his waist, and then he grasped the line with both hands.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Thirty ells!" said Frodo considering. "I believe it would be enough. If the storm passes before nightfall, I'm going to try it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“三十个手臂长！”佛罗多在脑海中估算着。“我想应该够了，如果暴雨在午夜之前结束，应该可以试试看。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And I'm thinking that I won't spend a moment longer than I need, stuck up on this edge with the eyes of the Dark Country looking over the marshes," said Frodo. With that he stood up and went down to the bottom of the gully again. He looked out. Clear sky was growing in the East once more. The skirts of the storm were lifting, ragged and wet, and the main battle had passed to spread its great wings over the Emyn Muil, upon which the dark thought of Sauron brooded for a while. Thence it turned, smiting the Vale of Anduin with hail and lightning, and casting its shadow upon Minas Tirith with threat of war. Then, lowering in the mountains, and gathering its great spires, it rolled on slowly over Gondor and the skirts of Rohan, until far away the Riders on the plain saw its black towers moving behind the sun, as they rode into the West. But here, over the desert and the reeking marshes the deep blue sky of evening opened once more, and a few pallid stars appeared, like small white holes in the canopy above the crescent moon.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我则是觉得若非绝对必要，也不想一分一秒多留在这里，忍受黑暗国度的监视。”佛罗多一说完，他就站起来走到深沟底。他探头往外看去，东方的天色又再度变得澄清，风暴的外缘已经开始瓦解，最主要的雨云则已经飘到爱明莫尔之上，也就是之前索伦曾经将心思集中的地方。乌云转了个方向，将暴雨和闪电击打在安都瑞尔的河谷上，并且将阴影投射在米那斯提力斯之上，彷佛带来了开战的威胁。然后，乌云穿出山脉，越积越高，最后移动到刚铎和洛汗国的边界；正往西方前进的骠骑们，正好看见如山般的乌云跟在太阳之后移动。不过，在这块彷佛被天地遗忘的荒地上，湛蓝色的天空又再度开启，几颗黯淡的星斗出现在天空上，彷佛新月之上的苍穹开了几个小口一般。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The rain's nearly given over already," said Sam; "but don't you go doing anything risky in the dim again, Mr. Frodo! And I haven't got over that shriek on the wind yet, if you have. Like a Black Rider it sounded -- but one up in the air, if they can fly. I'm thinking we'd best lay up in this crack till night's over."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“雨势已经开始在减小了，”山姆说：“可是，佛罗多先生，千万不要在微弱的光线里冒险了！即使你已经不在乎那风中的叫声，我还很担心呢。听起来像是黑骑士，只不过是空中传来的，仿佛他们学会了风行一样。我想我们最好等天亮，再试着离开这个地方。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Very well," said Sam heavily. "If it must be, let's get it over!" He took up the rope and made it fast over the stump nearest to the brink; then the other end he tied about his own waist. Reluctantly he turned and prepared to go over the edge a second time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，”山姆语气沉重地说：“如果别无选择，那我们还是赶快完成这一切吧！”他拿起绳子，将它紧紧地绑在最靠近崖边的树桩上，另外一边则是绑在自己的腰上。他不情愿地转过身，准备再度攀下悬崖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It does look sort of silver in the dark," said Sam. "Never noticed it before, though I can't remember as I've ever had it out since I first stowed it. But if you're so set on climbing, Mr. Frodo, how are you going to use it? Thirty ells, or say, about eighteen fathom: that's no more than your guess at the height of the cliff."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“它在黑暗里面看起来的确是银色的，”山姆说：“我之前从来没有注意过，不过，自从我上次将它收起来之后，也没有把它再拿出来过。佛罗多先生，如果你这么坚持要爬下去，要怎么利用这绳子？三十个手臂长，大概就是三十六尺左右，跟你估计悬崖的高度几乎一样。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's good to be able to see again," said Frodo, breathing deep. "Do you know, I thought for a bit that I had lost my sight? From the lightning or something else worse. I could see nothing, nothing at all, until the grey rope came down. It seemed to shimmer somehow."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“能够再看清楚眼前的景象真好！”佛罗多深吸一口气说：“你知道吗，我之前以为自己瞎掉了！多半是由于那闪电或是什么邪恶的力量。我什么都看不见，直到那绳子垂降下来，绳子似乎在黑暗中发出了银光。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Frodo thought for a while. "Make it fast to that stump, Sam!" he said. "Then I think you shall have your wish this time and go first. I'll lower you, and you need do no more than use your feet and hands to fend yourself off the rock. Though, if you put your weight on some of the ledges and give me a rest, it will help. When you're down, I'll follow. I feel quite myself again now."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佛罗多沉思了片刻。“山姆，把它绑紧在树桩上！”他说：“这次我想你可以如愿先下去了。我来把你放下去，你只需要用手脚保持平衡就好了。然后，如果你可以暂时站在能够稳住身形的地方，让我休息一下也是很好的。当你下去之后，我会跟着下来，我觉得自己已经恢复正常了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Frodo took rather more time to follow him. He had the rope about his waist and it was fast above, and he had shortened it so that it would pull him up before he reached the ground; still he did not want to risk a fall, and he had not quite Sam's faith in this slender grey line. He found two places, all the same, where he had to trust wholly to it: smooth surfaces where there was no hold even for his strong hobbit fingers and the ledges were far apart. But at last he too was down.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佛罗多则花了更多时间才下来。他将绳子更用力地绑在两边，也将绳子多绕了几圈，避免出现任何的危险。因为，他不想要再度冒着跌落悬崖的风险，而他又没有山姆对这绳子的强烈信心。同样的，他在其中两段地方都必须完全倚靠绳子的支撑，在那边，连哈比人强韧的手脚都无法找到任何的支撑点。幸好，他还是安全地下来了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It did not, however, turn out half as bad as he had expected. The rope seemed to give him confidence, though he shut his eyes more than once when he looked down between his feet. There was one awkward spot, where there was no ledge and the wall was sheer and even undercut for a short space; there he slipped and swung out on the silver line. But Frodo lowered him slowly and steadily, and it was over at last. His chief fear had been that the rope-length would give out while he was still high up, but there was still a good bight in Frodo's hands, when Sam came to the bottom and called up: "I'm down!" His voice came up clearly from below, but Frodo could not see him; his grey elven-cloak had melted into the twilight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="事实上，这次的经验并没有如他预期之中的糟糕。这绳子似乎让他有了信心，当他往下看的时候，还是好几次忍不住闭上眼睛。路上有段相当危险的地方，山壁往内凹，又完全没有落脚的地方，他只能靠着绳子晃荡。但佛罗多依旧稳定、持续地将他往下放，最后这段旅程终于结束了。他最担心的是在他距离地面还很高的时候绳子就会用完；不过，当山姆踩到地面的时候，佛罗多的手上还有好几匝的绳子。他对着头上大喊：“我到了！”他的声音虽然很清楚，但在暮色中，他的灰色斗篷已经和大地合而为一，佛罗多从崖顶上什么也看不见。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"They do cheer the heart, don't they?" said Sam looking up. "Elvish they are, somehow. And the Moon's growing. We haven't seen him for a night or two in this cloudy weather. He's beginning to give quite a light."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“它们真的让人心情一振，对吧？”山姆抬起头来说：“不知为何，我觉得它们看起来有种精灵的感觉。月亮也接近满月了。这种多云的天气已经有好几天没有看到，月亮越来越亮了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It certainly came," said Frodo, "and that's the chief thing. But now we've got to think of our next move. Night will be on us soon. How beautiful the stars are, and the Moon!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“它的确是掉下来了，”佛罗多说：“这才是最重要的事情。不过，现在我们得要想想接下来该怎么办，天马上就要黑了。你看，月亮和星星看起来多漂亮！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Under the first shadows of night they started out on the next stage of their journey. After a while Sam turned and looked back at the way they had come. The mouth of the gully was a black notch in the dim cliff. "I'm glad we've got the rope," he said. "We've set a little puzzle for that footpad, anyhow. He can try his nasty flappy feet on those ledges!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在夜色的第一道阴影之下，两人展开了第二阶段的旅程。过了一阵子之后，山姆转过头，看着他们经过的道路。深沟的出口看起来像是悬崖上的一道缺口。“幸好我们有带绳子，”他说：“我们应该给那个跟踪者留下了一个谜团，这次他可以用那双蹼在悬崖上好好玩玩了！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes," said Frodo; "but he won't be full for some days. I don't think we'll try the marshes by the light of half a moon."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没错，”佛罗多说：“但距离满月还有一些日子。我想，在这样的月色下，我们最好还是不要在荒原上赶路。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They picked their steps away from the skirts of the cliff, among a wilderness of boulders and rough stones, wet and slippery with the heavy rain. The ground still fell away sharply. They had not gone very far when they came upon a great fissure that yawned suddenly black before their feet. It was not wide, but it was too wide to jump across in the dim light. They thought they could hear water gurgling in its depths. It curved away on their left northward, back towards the hills, and so barred their road in that direction, at any rate while darkness lasted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们小心翼翼地在散布的乱石和树丛之间找路离开崖边，同时还必须要小心因为大雨而变得泥泞湿滑的地面。地形依旧相当陡峭，他们没走多远，就遇到了一个突然在他们面前出现的深沟。它不是很宽，但是在这种微弱的光线下要跳过去实在太危险了。两人甚至觉得可以听见沟中传来溪水流动的声音。这条深沟向他们的左边弯去，阻止了两人往北方的道路，至少在这黑暗中他们不可能朝这个方向走。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They did not find the going any easier at the broken feet of the Emyn Muil. Nor did Sam find any nook or hollow to shelter in: only bare stony slopes frowned over by the cliff, which now rose again, higher and more sheer as they went back. In the end, worn out, they just cast themselves on the ground under the lee of a boulder lying not far from the foot of the precipice. There for some time they sat huddled mournfully together in the cold stony night, while sleep crept upon them in spite of all they could do to hold it off. The moon now rode high and clear. Its thin white light lit up the faces of the rocks and drenched the cold frowning walls of the cliff, turning all the wide looming darkness into a chill pale grey scored with black shadows.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在爱明莫尔的山脚下跋涉，并没有让他们轻松多少，山姆也没有找到什么可以遮风避雨的地方，只有越来越陡峭的岩壁和崎岖的地形。到了最后，他们只能精疲力尽地找了个靠近悬崖的大石底下躺下来。他们可怜兮兮地躲在巨岩下，努力的和不停袭来的睡意搏斗。月亮此时已经升到半天高，微弱的白光照亮了湿透的岩壁，将整块黑暗的大地，转变成笼罩在黑色和灰色阴影之下的地形。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I suppose so," said Frodo. "I'm tired, and I don't think I can scramble among stones much longer tonight -- though I grudge the delay. I wish there was a clear path in front of us: then I'd go on till my legs gave way."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我也这么想，”佛罗多说：“我已经累了，不管我有多讨厌拖延，今晚也没有多少力气可以翻山越岭了。真希望眼前有一条清清楚楚的大路，这样一来，我宁愿走到腿快断掉再休息。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well!" said Frodo, standing up and drawing his cloak more closely round him. "You sleep for a bit Sam and take my blanket. I'll walk up and down on sentry for a while." Suddenly he stiffened, and stooping he gripped Sam by the arm. "What's that?" he whispered. "Look over there on the cliff!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧！”佛罗多站了起来，把斗篷裹得更紧一些。“山姆，你盖我的毯子睡一会儿吧。我先走走，负责守夜。”突然间他觉得浑身发冷，立刻弯腰抓住山姆的手臂。“那是什么？”他低语道：“你看悬崖上那是什么东西！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Down the face of a precipice, sheer and almost smooth it seemed in the pale moonlight, a small black shape was moving with its thin limbs splayed out. Maybe its soft clinging hands and toes were finding crevices and holds that no hobbit could ever have seen or used, but it looked as if it was just creeping down on sticky pads, like some large prowling thing of insect-kind. And it was coming down head first, as if it was smelling its way. Now and again it lifted its head slowly, turning it right back on its long skinny neck, and the hobbits caught a glimpse of two small pale gleaming lights, its eyes that blinked at the moon for a moment and then were quickly lidded again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在苍白月光的照耀下，显得几乎直上直下的悬崖上，有一个黑色的身影伸长了四肢往下爬。或许他如同触须一般的手脚，可以找到哈比人无法利用的缝隙和落脚处，但从远方看来，他似乎是靠着吸盘在山崖上前进的，好象某种蜥蜴或是昆虫一样；而且，他还是头朝下的往下爬，仿佛在嗅闻些什么。有时，他会缓缓抬起头，用长长的脖子左右转动脑袋；此时，哈比人会看见他一双眼睛朝着月亮眨啊眨的，接着又闭了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sam looked and breathed in sharply through his teeth. "Ssss!" he said. "That's what it is. It's that Gollum! Snakes and adders! And to think that I thought that we'd puzzle him with our bit of a climb! Look at him! Like a nasty crawling spider on a wall."</div>

<div class="line_en">"I don't know," said Frodo quietly, "but I think not. It is hard even for friendly eyes to see these elven-cloaks: I cannot see you in the shadow even at a few paces. And I've heard that he doesn't like Sun or Moon."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“那他又为什么会朝这个方向爬？”山姆问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, I'm sick of him," said Sam. "He's come once too often for me, and I'm going to have a word with him, if I can. I don't suppose we could give him the slip now anyway." Drawing his grey hood well over his face, Sam crept stealthily towards the cliff.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好吧，总之我已经厌倦这家伙紧追不舍的样子，”山姆说：“他实在太黏人了，这次如果有机会，我要跟他好好谈谈，我认为这次可不能让他再逃跑了。”山姆戴上兜帽，无声无息地朝向悬崖边移动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The black crawling shape was now three-quarters of the way down, and perhaps fifty feet or less above the cliff's foot. Crouching stone-still in the shadow of a large boulder the hobbits watched him. He seemed to have come to a difficult passage or to be troubled about something. They could hear him snuffling, and now and again there was a harsh hiss of breath that sounded like a curse. He lifted his head, and they thought they heard him spit. Then he moved on again. Now they could hear his voice creaking and whistling. "Ach, sss! Cautious, my precious! More haste less speed. We musstn't rissk our neck, musst we, precious? No, precious -- gollum!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那个黑影几乎已经爬了四分之三的路，距离地面只有不到五十尺的距离。两名哈比人埋伏在一颗大石旁，动也不动地观察着他。他似乎遇到了一段难以落脚的道路，或是遭遇了什么困难的抉择。两人可以听见他嗅闻着，有时还夹杂着听起来像是诅咒的嘶嘶声。他抬起头，佛罗多和山姆觉得似乎听见他吐痰的声音，然后他又继续往下移动。这时，他们终于可以清楚听见他的自言自语：“啊，嘶！小心，我的宝贝！欲速则不达。我们可不能太冒险，对吧，宝贝？当然了，宝贝──咕鲁！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“山姆，小声一点！”佛罗多警告道：“或许他闻得到我们的味道，我认为他的听力跟精灵一样灵敏。我想他现在多半已经听到了什么声音，可能就是我们谈话的声音。我们刚刚在那边不是大喊大叫的吗？而且，我们在不到几秒之前，说话都还是太大声了些。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He lifted his head again, blinked at the moon, and quickly shut his eyes. "We hate it," he hissed. "Nassty, nassty shivery light it is -- sss -- it spies on us, precious -- it hurts our eyes."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他又抬起头，对着月亮眨眼，接着很快地闭上眼。“我们讨厌这东西！”他嘶声说：“可恶讨厌的银光──嘶──它监视我们，宝贝，而且还让我们的眼睛很痛。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Indeed Gollum had suddenly paused again, and his large head on its scrawny neck was lolling from side to side as if he was listening. His pale eyes were half unlidded. Sam restrained himself, though his fingers were twitching. His eyes, filled with anger and disgust, were fixed on the wretched creature as he now began to move again, still whispering and hissing to himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="咕鲁那时的确停了下来，他连在细长脖子上的大脑袋四下转动着，仿佛正在倾听什么。他苍白的眼睛半睁了开来。山姆压抑住自己，只不过手指依旧不停地扭动着。他充满了愤怒和厌恶的双眼，则是集中在那个变形的生物身上，看着他再度开始移动，再度自言自语。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At last he was no more than a dozen feet from the ground, right above their heads. From that point there was a sheer drop, for the cliff was slightly undercut, and even Gollum could not find a hold of any kind. He seemed to be trying to twist round, so as to go legs first, when suddenly with a shrill whistling shriek he fell. As he did so, he curled his legs and arms up round him, like a spider whose descending thread is snapped.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，他到了距离地面不过十几尺的地方，就在两人的头上。从那边开始悬崖往内凹，连咕鲁都找不到任何支撑身体的地方，他似乎想要扭转过身体，准备用脚先下去。就在此时，他突然尖叫着跌落下来，同时，他的手臂和脚将身体团团包住，就像是丝线突然断裂的蜘蛛一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sam was out of his hiding in a flash and crossed the space between him and the cliff-foot in a couple of leaps. Before Gollum could get up, he was on top of him. But he found Gollum more than he bargained for, even taken like that, suddenly, off his guard after a fall. Before Sam could get a hold, long legs and arms were wound round him pinning his arms, and a clinging grip, soft but horribly strong, was squeezing him like slowly tightening cords; clammy fingers were feeling for his throat. Then sharp teeth bit into his shoulder. All he could do was to butt his hard round head sideways into the creature's face. Gollum hissed and spat, but he did not let go.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆飞快地从躲藏处跑了出来，三步并做两步就冲到悬崖边，在咕鲁来得及站起来之前，他就已经扑了上去。但他惊讶地发现，咕鲁即使刚从悬崖上落下来，又遭遇到这种突如其来的危机，也比他预料的难缠多了。在山姆来得及抓住他之前，他的长手和长脚已经将对方紧紧抱住；柔软但极为强壮的四肢正如同丝线一般慢慢地收紧，两只粘粘的双手也正在摸索着他的咽喉，接着，他锐利的牙齿咬住了山姆的肩膀。山姆唯一能做的就是把头用力撞上咕鲁的脸，咕鲁发出嘶嘶声，不停地挣扎，但就是不肯放手。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Things would have gone ill with Sam, if he had been alone. But Frodo sprang up, and drew Sting from its sheath. With his left hand he drew back Gollum's head by his thin lank hair, stretching his long neck, and forcing his pale venomous eyes to stare up at the sky.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果山姆只有一个人，可能就会遭遇到难以想象的厄运，但佛罗多迅速地扑上来，将刺针拔出鞘。他用左手拉住咕鲁稀疏的头发，让他不由自主地往后仰，露出长长的脖子，强迫他那双恶毒的眼睛瞪着天空。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yess. Yess. No!" shrieked Gollum. "Once, by accident it was, wasn't it, precious? Yes, by accident. But we won't go back, no, no!" Then suddenly his voice and language changed, and he sobbed in his throat, and spoke but not to them. "Leave me alone, gollum! You hurt me. O my poor hands, gollum! I, we, I don't want to come back. I can't find it. I am tired. I, we can't find it, gollum, gollum, no, nowhere. They're always awake. Dwarves, Men, and Elves, terrible Elves with bright eyes. I can't find it. Ach!"

Soon the sound of their soft breathing could be heard. Gollum's hands twitched a little. Hardly perceptibly his head moved to the left and the right, and first one eye and then the other opened a slit. The hobbits made no sign.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="佛罗多看着山姆，两人的眼神交会，立刻就明白对方的意思。他们放松下来，头靠着山壁，假装闭上眼。咕鲁的手抽动了一下，他的头用几乎无法察觉的动作，往左右微微扫视了片刻。接着，他先张开一只眼，然后是另外一只，哈比人不动声色。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The hobbits seated themselves beside him, one on either side, with their backs to the stony wall, resting their legs. There was no need for any arrangement by word: they knew that they must not sleep for a moment. Slowly the moon went by. Shadows fell down from the hills, and all grew dark before them. The stars grew thick and bright in the sky above. No one stirred. Gollum sat with his legs drawn up, knees under chin, flat hands and feet splayed on the ground, his eyes closed; but he seemed tense, as if thinking or listening.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈比人们在他身边坐了下来，一边一个人，每个人的背都靠着墙壁，不约而同地伸出脚来休息。他们彼此之间不需要任何的沟通，全都知道不能够浪费时间在睡觉上面。月亮慢慢地隐退，阴影从山脉间落下，一切被黑暗所笼罩，天空上的星辰在黑暗衬托下，显得额外的明亮。咕鲁将膝盖顶着下巴，手和脚放在地上，闭着眼，但他的身体十分的僵硬，似乎在倾听着些什么。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="山姆拿出绳子。“咕鲁先生，在这个荒凉的地方，你又准备要去哪里啊？”他咬牙切齿地说：“我们很怀疑哪，很怀疑，我敢保证是要去找你的半兽人朋友吧。你这个肮脏的狡猾东西，这绳子应该套在你的脖子上打结才对，而且还应该是个死结。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="在山姆打绳结的时候，他低头看着咕鲁，绳子的效果让他们全都吃了一惊。咕鲁开始尖叫，那是种单薄、刺耳的声音，让人听起来很难过。他不停地扭动，试着用嘴巴咬绳子，不管旁人怎么反应，他就是尖叫个不停。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我们接下来，只需要找到什么东西可以固定住他就好了，”佛罗多说，“我们想要让他可以走路，所以不能够绑住他的腿，或是他的手臂，这家伙走起路来似乎是手脚并用的。那么就绑住他的一只脚踝，另外一端由我们来抓住就好了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At last Frodo was convinced that he really was in pain; but it could not be from the knot. He examined it and found that it was not too tight, indeed hardly tight enough.

<div class="line_cn" title="最后，佛罗多终于相信他是真的很痛苦，但这应该不是绳结的效果。他仔细地检查绳结，发现它并不算特别紧，事实上根本不够紧。山姆一向是刀子嘴、豆腐心。“你怎么搞的？”他说：“如果你老是想逃跑，我们一定得把你绑起来，但我们又不想伤到你。”">查看中文翻译</div>

From that moment a change, which lasted for some time, came over him. He spoke with less hissing and whining, and he spoke to his companions direct, not to his precious self. He would cringe and flinch, if they stepped near him or made any sudden movement, and he avoided the touch of their elven-cloaks; but he was friendly, and indeed pitifully anxious to please. He would cackle with laughter and caper, if any jest was made, or even if Frodo spoke kindly to him, and weep if Frodo rebuked him. Sam said little to him of any sort.
