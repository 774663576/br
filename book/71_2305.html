<div class="line_en">The baron, consequently, adored Count Andrea Cavalcanti. The same could not be said of Mlle Eugénie Danglars. Having an instinctive horror of marriage, she had welcomed Andrea as a means of repelling Morcerf; but now that Andrea was coming too close, she began to feel a visible repulsion towards him. The baron may perhaps have noticed it but, as he could only attribute this feeling to a whim, he had pretended not to notice it.</div>

<div class="line_en">The elder Cavalcanti had been contacted by letter and had warmly approved of the match. Expressing deep regret that his duties absolutely forbade him to leave Parma, where he then was, he stated his intention of releasing a capital sum sufficient to give an income of 150,000 livres. It was agreed that the three million would be entrusted to Danglars, who would invest them. Some people had tried to sow doubt in the young man's mind about the solidity of his future father-in-law's position: Danglars had recently been making repeated losses on the Exchange; but the young man, with sublime confidence and disinterestedness, dismissed all these vain murmurings, and had the tact to say nothing about them to the baron.</div>

<div class="line_en">One morning Albert was awoken by his valet, announcing Beauchamp. He rubbed his eyes and asked for the visitor to be shown into the little smoking parlour on the ground floor. Then he dressed quickly and went down. Beauchamp was pacing up and down, but he stopped when he saw Albert.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一天早晨，阿尔培的贴身跟班唤醒他，通报波香来访。阿尔培擦擦眼睛，吩咐仆人请他在楼下的小吸烟室里稍候，很快地穿好衣服，走下楼去。他发觉波香在房间里踱来踱去，一看到他，波香就止步了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Meanwhile, the period of grace that Beauchamp had asked for had almost passed. During it, Morcerf had come to appreciate the value of Monte Cristo's advice when he told him to let the matter clear itself up. No one had remarked on the note about the general and no one had thought to identify the officer who had betrayed the castle of Janina with the noble count who sat in the Upper House.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="波香要求延期的时间快满了。马瑟夫现在已领悟到伯爵劝他息事宁人那个忠告的价值。谁都不曾留心到关于将军的那则消息，谁都不曾认出那个出卖亚尼纳城的法国军官就是贵族院里那个高贵的伯爵。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As for Beauchamp, he had not been seen since the day of Albert's visit and, whenever anyone asked for him, the reply was that he had left for a few days' journey. Where was he? Nobody knew.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="波香自从阿尔培去拜访他那天起，便再没有人见到过他，阿尔培每次向人问及他，人家总是回答他已旅行去了，要过些日子才能回来。他究竟到哪儿去，谁都不知道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Even so, Albert felt insulted, because the intention to offend was quite obviously there, in the few lines that had wounded his honour. Moreover, the manner in which Beauchamp had ended their meeting had left a bitter taste in his mouth. For these reasons, he still harboured the idea of a duel but hoped, if Beauchamp would agree, that they might be able to disguise the real reason for it, even from their seconds.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是阿尔培并不觉得他所受的侮辱已减轻，激怒他的那几行消息显然是一种故意的侮辱。此外，波香结束上次会谈时的态度在他的心里留下了一个痛苦的记忆。所以他的头脑里依旧存着希望决斗的念头，并希望瞒住这次决斗的真原因，甚至瞒过他的陪证人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"One can do what I did, Albert, which is to say: money, time and effort are nothing when it is a matter of the reputation and interests of an entire family. One says: more than probability is needed, we must have certainty if we are to accept a duel to the death with a friend. One says: if I cross swords or pull the trigger against a man whose hand I have shaken over the past three years, I must at least know why I am doing such a thing, so that I may arrive at the appointed place with my mind at rest and the easy conscience which a man needs when he must use his arm to save his life."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“就是照我的方法办，阿尔培，我这样想：金钱、时间和疲劳，比起一个家庭的名誉和利害来，是不算一回事的。‘大概如此’这几个字还不够有力，只有事实才能判明是否应该和一个朋友作一场致命的决斗。假如我以一把剑的剑锋或一支手枪的子弹指向一个三年来曾与我交往亲密的人，我至少必须知道我为什么要那样做，我必须带着一颗无愧的心去与他相会，而当一个人必须用他自己的武器救自己生命的时候，是需要那种安静的良心的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

"Let nothing remain except the eternal friendship that I owe to my saviour, a friendship that my children will transfer to yours, a friendship that will always remind me that I owe you the blood in my veins, the life in my body and the honour of my name… For, if such a thing were to be known, oh, Beauchamp! I am telling you, I would blow my brains out. Or else, no, my poor mother! I should not wish to kill her at the same time -- otherwise, I should go abroad."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，是的，”阿尔培说，“只让永恒的友谊存在吧，我向我的救主答应那种友谊将勉励我们的子孙世世代代保存下去，并使我永远记得：我的生命和名誉都出于你的恩赐！因为，假如这件事被人知道，噢！波香呀，我就得毁灭我自己，或是——不，我可怜的母亲！我不能让这个打击杀死她——我就得逃离我的祖国了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Albert seized them convulsively, crumpled them, twisted them and considered tearing them up; but, fearing that the smallest scrap might be blown away in the wind and come back to haunt him one day, he went across to the candle which he kept burning continually to light cigars, and let the flames devour them to the last fragment. "Dear friend, best of friends!" he muttered, as he burned the papers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿尔培用一只颤抖的手抓过来，把它们撕得粉碎。他浑身发抖，深恐逃走一小片将来再出现到他面前，他走到那支老是燃着准备点雪茄的蜡烛前面，把每一片碎纸都烧掉。“亲爱的好朋友！”他一面烧那些文件，一面轻轻地说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"What it is," Albert said, "is that something is broken in my heart. You must understand, Beauchamp, that one cannot in an instant abandon that feeling of respect, of confidence and pride, that a father's spotless name inspires in his son. Oh, Beauchamp! How shall I face him? Shall I shrink back when he puts his lips to my forehead or withdraw my hand from his touch? Beauchamp, I am the most wretched of men. Oh, my mother, my poor mother!" he said, looking through tear-filled eyes at her portrait. "How you would have suffered, had you witnessed all this!"</div>
