<div class="line_en">Dantès went through all the stages of misery endured by prisoners who are left entombed in prison. He started with pride, which is the product of hope and the knowledge of one's innocence. Then he came to doubt his own innocence, which did a great deal to justify the governor's ideas on mental derangement. Finally, he fell from the summit of his pride and prayed, not to God, but to men; God is the last refuge. Such unfortunates, who should begin with Our Lord, only come to trust in Him after exhausting all other sources of hope.</div>

<div class="line_en">So Dantès prayed to be removed from his dungeon and put in another, even one that was deeper and darker: any change, albeit for the worse, would be a change, and would provide some relief for a few days. He begged to be allowed exercise, fresh air, books or implements. None of these requests was granted, but he continued to make them for all that. He had become accustomed to talk to his new jailer, even though the man was (if that was possible) more uncommunicative than his predecessor: it was still a pleasure to speak to another human being, however dumb. Dantès talked to hear the sound of his own voice; he had tried talking to himself when he was alone, but that frightened him.</div>

<div class="line_en">One day he begged the jailer to ask for him to be given a cell-mate: anyone, even the mad abbé he had heard about. However rough a jailer's skin, there is always something human beneath. Although he had never shown any sign of it, the jailer had often, in the depth of his heart, pitied this unfortunate young man whose captivity was so harsh; so he passed on Number 34's message to the governor. The latter, cautious as a politician, concluded however that Dantès wanted to start a riot among the prisoners, devise some plot or have a friend to help him in an escape attempt. He turned down the request.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他恳求狱卒有一天可以给他弄到一个同伴，即使是那个疯长老也好。那狱卒，纵然因为看惯了许多受苦的情形而变硬了心肠，却总是一个人。在他的心底里，也曾常常同情于这个如此受苦的不幸的青年，于是他把三十四号的要求呈到堡长面前。但后者却审慎得象是一位政治家，竟以为邓蒂斯想结党或企图逃跑，所以拒绝了他的请求。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Often, in the days of his freedom, Dantès had been alarmed at the idea of the obscure revels and terrifying camaraderie of those prison cells where vagabonds, bandits and murderers share their base pleasures. But he came to wish that he might be thrown into one of those holes, so that he could catch sight of some other face apart from that of his impassive jailer who refused to speak; and he dreamed of a convict's life: the shameful uniform, the ankle chain, the branded shoulder. At least men in the galleys enjoyed the company of their fellows, they breathed fresh air and could see the open sky. Convicts were lucky.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在入狱以前，每当邓蒂斯想到那些犯人聚集在一起，有贼，有流浪汉，有杀人的凶犯，心中便不禁要作呕。现在他希望和他们在一起，以便除了那不和他讲话的狱卒以外，还可以看到一些其他的面孔，他羡慕那些穿着囚衣，系着铁链，肩上钉着记号的苦工。充当苦工的囚徒能呼吸到外面新鲜的空气，又能互相见面，他们是非常幸福的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So he prayed, not with fervour, but with fury. Praying aloud, he was no longer frightened by the sound of his own words; he fell into a sort of ecstasy, he saw God radiant in every word he uttered and confided every action of his humble and abandoned life to the will of this powerful Deity, deriving instruction from them and setting himself tasks to perform. At the end of every prayer he added the self-interested entreaty that men more often contrive to address to their fellows than to God: "And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that trespass against us."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后他陷入于一种神志昏迷恍惚的状态。他看到上帝在倾听他所说的每一个字。他把他一生的行动都献到万能的主的前面，诉说他所愿意完成的种种工作，并在每一次祷告的结尾引用这一句向上帝请求时所常用而向人请求时更常用的话，“请宽恕我们的罪恶，象我们宽恕那些负罪于我们的人一样。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dantès had exhausted every human resource. Inevitably, as we said earlier, he turned to God. Every pious notion ever sown in the world and gleaned by some wretch, bowed beneath the yoke of destiny, now came to refresh his soul. He recalled the prayers that his mother had taught him and discovered a significance in them that he had not previously understood: to a happy man, a prayer is a monotonous composition, void of meaning, until the day when suffering deciphers the sublime language through which the poor victim addresses God.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓蒂斯已尽了一切努力；他于是转向上帝。所有那些久已忘记的敬神之念都回来了。他记起了他母亲所教他的祷告，并在那些祷告里发现了一种他以前一向所不知道的意义。因为在境遇顺利的时候，祷告似乎只是字语的堆积，直到有一天，灾祸来向那不幸的受难者说明，他祈求上苍怜悯的话，是多么的崇高！他祷告，不是热诚地祷告，而是忿怒地祷告。他大声祷告，他已不再怕听他自己的声音了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So his mind darkened and a cloud formed in front of his eyes. Dantès was a simple, uneducated man; to him, the past was covered by a murky veil that can be raised only by knowledge. In the solitude of his dungeon and the desert of his thoughts, he could not reconstruct ages past, revive extinct races or rebuild those antique cities that imagination augments and poeticizes so that they pass before one's eyes, gigantic and lit by fiery skies, as in Martin's Babylonian scenes. All he had were: his own past, which was so short; his present -- so sombre; and his future -- so uncertain: nineteen years of light to contemplate, in what might be eternal darkness! There was consequently nothing to help distract his mind. His energetic spirit, which would have wished for nothing better than to take flight through the ages, was forced to remain trapped like an eagle in a cage. He clung to one idea: that of his happiness, which had been destroyed, for no apparent reason, by an unprecedented stroke of fate. He refused to release this thought, turning it over and over, as it were consuming it ravenously, like the pitiless Ugolino devouring Archbishop Roger's skull in Dante's Inferno. His faith had been transient and he lost it, as others do when they achieve success. The difference was that he had not gained by it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后，一种阴郁的情绪充满了他的心头。他很单纯，又没有受过什么教育，所以，在他那孤独的黑牢里，凭他自己的那一些思想，他无法重新构筑起那些逝去的世纪，复活那些消灭了的民族，重建那些被想象渲染得如此广大宏伟，象在马丁①的名画里那样被天火所烛照，而已在我们眼前消逝了的古代城市。他无法做到这一步，他过去的生命是这样的短暂，目前的是这样的阴郁，未来的是这样的朦胧。十九年的光去烛照那无穷尽的黑暗是太微弱了！他没有消闷解愁的方法。他那充沛的精神，本来可以借追溯往事来活动活动的，现在却被囚禁了起来，象一只被关在笼子里的鹰一样。他只抓住一个念头，——就是他的幸福，那被空前的劫运所不明不白地毁灭了的幸福。他把这个念头想了又想，然后，象但丁的地狱里的乌哥里诺吞下罗格大主教的头颅骨似的把它囫囵吞了下去。【注：①约翰·马丁（1789－1854），英国画家。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Fury followed asceticism. Edmond's curses made his jailer start back in horror. He dashed himself against the walls of his prison and raged against everything around him, himself first of all, at the slightest discomfort caused by a grain of sand, a straw or a draught. Then it was that he recalled the denunciatory letter that he had seen, that Villefort had shown him, that his hands had touched. Every line blazed on the cell wall like the Mene, Mene, Tekel, Upharsin at Belshazzar's feast. He decided that it was human hatred and not divine vengeance that had plunged him into this abyss. He doomed these unknown men to every torment that his inflamed imagination could devise, while still considering that the most frightful were too mild and, above all, too brief for them: torture was followed by death, and death brought, if not repose, at least an insensibility that resembled it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="刻苦自制以后接着就来了狂怒。邓蒂斯把他自己的身体去撞监狱的墙壁，口里大喊着渎神的咒骂，以致他的狱卒恐怖地望而却步。他把他的愤怒转嫁到他周围的一切，尤其是泄怒于他自己，泄怒于那来惹恼他的最微细的东西，——一粒沙，一茎草，或一丝气，然后，维尔福给他看的那封告密信在他的脑海里重新浮现出来，一行一行似乎是用火红的字母写在墙上①。他对自己说，把他投入到这种无限痛苦的深渊里的，是人的仇恨而不是天的报应。他用他所能想象得出的种种最可怕的毒刑来惩罚这些不明的迫害者，但觉得一切毒刑都不够厉害，因为在毒刑以后接着就来了死，而死以后，即使不是安息，至少也是近于安息的那种麻木状态。【注：①见《旧约》《但以理书》第五章，伯沙撒王设宴纵饮，忽见手指在粉墙上写了几个大字。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He often told himself, thinking of his enemies, that tranquillity was death and that other means, apart from death, were needed by whoever wished to inflict a cruel punishment, until eventually he fell into the melancholy quietude of thoughts of suicide. Woe to the man who, sliding into misfortune, is drawn by such dark thoughts! This is one of those dead seas that seem to offer the inviting blue of pure waters, but where the swimmer's feet are sucked into a bituminous mire which draws him, drags him down and swallows him up. Once caught, he is lost if God does not come to his aid, and every effort that he makes pulls him nearer to death.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="由于老是想着死就是安息，由于想发明比死更残酷的刑罚，他就开始想到自杀。真不幸，处于痛苦中的他竟又扯上了这种念头！自杀之念就象是那些死海，肉眼看来似乎很波平浪静；但假如轻率地冒险投入它的怀抱，就会发现自己被陷在一个泥沼里，愈陷愈深地被吞进去。只要一经陷入，除非上帝的保护之手把他从那里拔出来，否则就一切都完了，他的挣扎只是加速他的毁灭而已。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">However, this state of moral agony is less fearful than the suffering that precedes it or the punishment that may follow: it is a kind of dizzying comfort to contemplate the open abyss when, at the bottom of that abyss, lies nothingness. Reaching this point, Edmond found some consolation in the idea; all his sufferings, all his sorrows and the procession of spectres that follow in their train seemed to take wing and fly from the corner of his prison where the angel of death might rest his silent foot. Dantès looked with equanimity at his past life, with terror at what was to come, and chose the mid-point that appeared to offer a refuge.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，这种心灵上的惨境却没有先前的受苦和此后的惩罚那样可怕。这也是一种慰藉，这种慰藉犹如使人只看见深渊张开的大口，而不知底下却是一片黑暗。爱德蒙从这个念头上得了一些安慰。当死神似乎快要进来的时候，他一切的忧愁，一切的痛苦，以及伴随着忧愁痛苦而来的那一连串妖魔鬼怪都从他的地牢里逃了出去。邓蒂斯平静地回顾他过去的生活，恐怖地瞻仰他的未来，就选择了那条似乎可以给他作一个避难所的中间的路线。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Sometimes," he thought at such moments, "in my distant voyages, when I was still a man -- and when that man, free and powerful, gave orders to others that they carried out -- I used to see the sky open, the sea tremble and groan, a storm brewing in some part of the sky and thrashing the horizon with its wings like a giant eagle; then I would feel that my vessel was nothing but a useless refuge, itself shaking and shuddering, as light as a feather in the hand of a giant. Soon the appearance of some sharp rocks and the awful thundering of the waves against them spoke to me of death, and death appalled me. I strove to escape it, uniting all my strength as a man and all my skill as a sailor in the struggle against God!… All this, because I was happy then; to return to life was to return to happiness; because I had not asked for death, I had not chosen it; because finally sleep on a bed of seaweed and pebbles seemed hard to me -- I, who believed myself to be a creature made in the image of God, rebelled at the idea of serving, after my death, as nourishment for seagulls and vultures. But today it is different: I have lost everything that could make me love life and now death smiles at me like a nursemaid to the child she will rock to sleep. Today I die at my own pleasure and go to sleep, tired and broken, as I used to fall asleep after one of those evenings of despair and fury when I had counted three thousand circuits of my room, that is to say thirty thousand paces, or almost ten leagues."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“有的时候，”他说，“在我的航程中，当我还是自由自在，身强力壮，指挥着别人的时候，我也曾见过天空突然阴暗，海洋暴怒地吐着白沫，浪头汹涌而起，象一只用翅膀遮空而来的大怪鸟似的。那时，我觉得我的船只是一个不起作用的藏身处，象是巨人手中的一根羽毛，在大风暴之前颤抖着，震荡着。不久，浪潮的怒吼和尖利的岩石向我宣布死快要临头了，那时，死很使我恐怖，于是我用了一个男子汉和一个水手的全部技术和智慧与万能的主抗争。我所以这样做，因为那时我很幸福，因为回到生命也就是回到欢乐，因为我不允许那样的死，不愿意那样的死，因为长眠在岩石和海藻所筑成的床上这种景象似乎很可怕，因为我不愿意象我这样一个上帝用照他自己的模样创造出来的人给海鸥和大鸦作食粮。但现在不同了。我已经丧失了使我留恋于生命的一切，死神在向我微笑，邀我去长眠。我是自愿死的。我是精疲力尽而死的。就好象在那几天晚上，我绕着这个地牢踱了三千遍以后带着绝望和忿怒睡去一样。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There were two ways for him to die. The first was simple: it involved fixing his kerchief to one of the bars on the window and hanging himself. The alternative was to pretend to eat and allow himself to die of hunger. Dantès was very loath to adopt the first course. He had been brought up with a horror of pirates, people who are hanged from the yardarm, so he saw hanging as an ignominious method of execution which he did not want to apply to himself. Consequently he chose the second way and began to carry out his decision that very day.</div>

<div class="line_en">He did as he had promised. Twice a day, he threw his food out of the little barred opening which gave him no more than a glimpse of the sky, first joyfully, then thoughtfully and finally with regret. He had to remind himself of the oath he had sworn to find the strength to pursue his awful resolution. Seen with the eyes of hunger, this food, which had formerly disgusted him, appeared appetizing to look at and smelled exquisite. Sometimes he held the plate containing it for an hour in his hand, staring at the piece of rotten meat or repulsive fish, and the mouldy black bread. The last instinct of survival struggled within him and occasionally defeated his resolve. At such times, his dungeon seemed less dark and his situation less desperate. He was still young, he must be about twenty-five or twenty-six, so he had roughly fifty years left to live, that is to say twice as long as he had lived so far. In this vast expanse of time, how many different events might unlock the doors and break down the walls of the Château d'If, and set him free! At such times he put his lips towards the meal that, like a deliberate Tantalus, he was snatching from his own mouth. But then he would remember the oath which his nature was too generous to break for fear that he might end by despising himself. So, firm and implacable, he summoned up the little remnant of life that remained to him, until the day came when they brought him his supper and he was too weak to get up and throw it out of the window.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他履行了他的誓言，把狱卒每天给他拿来的两次食物从钉着栅栏的窗洞里倒出去，——最初很高兴，后来就有点犹豫，最后则很悔恨。只有记起他的誓言才使他有力量继续这样做下去。饥饿美化了这些一度曾这样使人噁心，这样刺眼和这样触鼻的食物。有几次，他整小时的把盘子端在手里，凝视着那不满一口的腐肉，臭鱼和发霉的黑面包。神秘的生存本能依旧还在他的内心冲激着，有时竟征服了他的决心，那时，他的黑牢似乎没有以前那么阴森了，他的境况也没有以前那么绝望了。他还年轻，——才不过二十四五岁，他差不多还有五十年可活。在那样广大的时空里，谁能断言不会发生什么不能预料的事故来打开他的牢门，恢复他的自由？他本来自愿做丹达露斯①，自动拒绝进饮食，但想到这里，他就把食物举到唇边；但他又想起了他的誓言，他天性高尚，深怕打破誓言会有损人格。于是他残酷无情地坚持下去，直到最后，他连把晚餐抛到窗洞外面去的力量都不够了。【注：①希腊神话中人物。天神宙斯之子，因泄露天上机密，罚降下界，受饥渴之苦。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Weak as he was, the young man's brain was struck by an ordinary notion which is constantly present in a prisoner's mind: freedom. This noise came so aptly at the moment when, for him, every noise was about to cease, that he felt God must finally be taking pity on his suffering an sending him this noise to warn him to stop on the edge of the grave above which his foot was already poised. Who knows? Perhaps one of his friends, one of those beloved beings about whom he had thought so much that his mind was worn out with it, might be concerned for him at this moment and trying to lessen the distance between them.</div>

Unfortunately, Edmond's head was an empty vessel, deafened by the buzzing of a single idea; he was so weak that his mind drifted like a whiff of smoke and could not fasten on a single thought. He could see only one way to sharpen his wits and recover the lucidity of his judgement: he turned towards the still-steaming broth that the jailer had just put down on the table, got up, staggered over to it, took the cup, raised it to his lips and drank down the liquid that it contained with an unspeakable sensation of well-being.</div>

Then, between these periods of feverish activity, he listened to hear if the sound had returned, growing impatient with the caution shown by this prisoner who had not guessed that it was another like himself who had disturbed him in his efforts to escape -- another prisoner whose eagerness to be free was at least as great as his own.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the evening the jailer came. Dantès was on his bed, feeling that there he was better able to guard the unfinished opening. He must have looked at this unwelcome visitor in a peculiar manner, because the man said: "Come, come, are you going mad again?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="傍晚时分，狱卒来了，邓蒂斯已上了床。他觉得这样似乎可以把那未完成的洞口保护得更安全一点。他的眼里无疑的露出了一种奇异的表情，因为那狱卒说，“喂，你又疯了吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When night came, Dantès thought that his neighbour would take advantage of the silence and darkness to resume their conversation, but he was wrong. The night passed but no sound came to relieve his feverish expectation. But the following day, after the morning visit, when he had just moved his bed away from the wall, he heard three knocks, equally spaced. He fell to his knees.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dantès was half inside the opening and, at this moment, the portion of ground on which he was resting his two hands seemed to give way beneath him. He plunged back, while a mass of earth, rubble and broken stones fell away into a hole that had opened up beneath the opening which he himself had made. Then, in the bottom of this dark hole, the depth of which he was unable to assess, he saw a head appear, then some shoulders and finally a whole man, who emerged, with a fair degree of agility, from the pit they had dug.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓蒂斯这时半个身体埋在洞口里，在一刹那间，他撑手的那一块地面开始陷了下去。他缩回身来，一大堆石头和泥土落了下去，而就在他自己所挖成的这个洞下面，又露出一个洞来。接着，从那个无法知道深浅的洞底里，他看到最初露出一个头，接着露出了肩膀，最后露出了一个人的身体，那个人轻轻地跳进他的地牢里。">查看中文翻译</div>
