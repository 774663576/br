He didn't worry about a shirt because once he began running he would be hot as popping grease even if the morning air was chill, or shoes because the bottoms of his feet were by now as tough as his worn-out sneakers.</div>

<div class="line_en">He tiptoed out of the house. The place was so rattly that it screeched whenever you put your foot down, but Jess had found that if you tiptoed, it gave only a low moan, and he could usually get outdoors without waking Momma or Ellie or Brenda or Joyce Ann. May Belle was another matter. She was going on seven, and she worshiped him, which was OK sometimes. When you were the only boy smashed between four sisters, and the older two had despised you ever since you stopped letting them dress you up and wheel you around in their rusty old doll carriage, and the littlest one cried if you looked at her cross-eyed, it was nice to have somebody who worshiped you. Even if it got unhandy sometimes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他踮起脚，悄悄地走出屋子。在他们的屋子里一动就嘎嘎地响，无论什么地方，只要把脚踩下去，就会发出刺耳的声音。但杰斯找到了窍门，把脚踮起来，声音就低得多，如同微弱的呻吟。所以，他这样走出去，通常不会吵醒妈妈，也不会吵醒艾丽、布兰达或乔伊丝·安。至于梅宝，那是另外一回事了。她快满七岁，很崇拜他，有时候被人崇拜很不错。当你是唯一的男孩，被夹在四个姐妹中，这滋味！两个姐姐么，曾经帮你打扮起来，把你放在已被她们坐得生了锈的旧娃娃车里推着到处跑，但自从你不要她们这样做的时候起，她们就看不起你了；而最小的妹妹呢，你斜着眼瞅她一下，她就哭；所以，有个人崇拜你，也挺好。即使有时候你不大方便，那也无妨。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He began to trot across the yard. His breath was coming out in little puffs -- cold for August. But it was early yet. By noontime when his mom would have him out working, it would be hot enough.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他喊了一声“嘭”就起跑，绕着奶牛场飞奔。贝茜小姐嘴里慢慢嚼着草，悠悠地朝场中心走去，困倦的眼睛跟着他转。她看起来不是很机灵，即使在奶牛里也不算机灵，但却能迅速地躲开，给杰斯让出路来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His straw-colored hair flapped hard against his forehead, and his arms and legs flew out every which way. He had never learned to run properly, but he was long-legged for a ten-year-old, and no one had more grit than he.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的浅黄色头发使劲拍打着前额，双臂和两腿飞快地摆动着。他从来没有学过正确的跑步姿势，但在十岁的孩子里，他却算是个腿长的，而且没有一个人有他这样坚毅的精神。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Lark Creek Elementary was short on everything, especially athletic equipment, so all the balls went to the upper grades at recess time after lunch. Even if a fifth grader started out the period with a ball, it was sure to be in the hands of a sixth or seventh grader before the hour was half over. The older boys always took the dry center of the upper field for their ball games, while the girls claimed the small top section for hopscotch and jump rope and hanging around talking. So the lower-grade boys had started this running thing. They would all line up on the far side of the lower field, where it was either muddy or deep crusty ruts. Earle Watson who was no good at running, but had a big mouth, would yell "Bang!" and they'd race to a line they'd toed across at the other end.</div>

<div class="line_en">One time last year Jesse had won. Not just the first heat but the whole shebang. Only once. But it had put into his mouth a taste for winning. Ever since he'd been in first grade he'd been that "crazy little kid that draws all the time." But one day -- April the twenty-second, a drizzly Monday, it had been -- he ran ahead of them all, the red mud slooching up through the holes in the bottom of his sneakers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="去年，有一次杰西赢了。赢的不仅是第一场小组赛，而是整个比赛。不过也仅仅只有那么一次。但就是这一次使他尝到了胜利的滋味。他从一年级起，一直是“始终在画画的发疯小男孩”。但是，有一天——四月二十二日，星期一，细雨蒙蒙，那是有意义的一天——那天，他跑在最前面，超过了所有的人，而红色的烂泥浆却穿过他运动鞋底上的几个洞冒了出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For the rest of that day, and until after lunch on the next, he had been "the fastest kid in the third, fourth, and fifth grades," and he only a fourth grader. On Tuesday, Wayne Pettis had won again as usual. But this year Wayne Pettis would be in the sixth grade. He'd play football until Christmas and baseball until June with the rest of the big guys. Anybody had a chance to be the fastest runner, and by Miss Bessie, this year it was going to be Jesse Oliver Aarons, Jr.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从那一天那个时候开始，直到第二天午饭后，他都是跑得最快的，“在三年级、四年级，甚至五年级里，跑得最快的”，而他才上四年级。星期二，韦恩·佩提斯像往常一样，又赢了。但这一学年，韦恩·佩提斯该上六年级了。他该和其他的大孩子一起玩橄榄球，一直玩到圣诞节；然后打棒球，打到六月份。每个人都有机会成为跑得最快的运动员。在小母牛贝茜小姐看来，今年该是小杰西·奥利弗·艾伦斯了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jess pumped his arms harder and bent his head for the distant fence. He could hear the third-grade boys screaming him on. They would follow him around like a country-music star. And May Belle would pop her buttons. Her brother was the fastest, the best. That ought to give the rest of the first grade something to chew their cuds on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰斯更加使劲地摆动双臂，头倾向远方另一端的围栏。他能听到三年级的男生在不断尖声呼喊他的名字。像追随乡村音乐明星那样，到处簇拥着他。梅宝将拍打着小东西，说他的哥哥跑的最快，最好。这一定会给一年级的其他学生一样东西，让他们好好琢磨琢磨，思量思量。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Which left Jess to do the work as usual. Momma never sent the babies out to help, although if he worked it right he could usually get May Belle to do something. He put his head down on the table. The running had done him in this morning. Through his top ear came the sound of the Timmonses' old Buick --"Wants oil," his dad would say -- and the happy buzz of voices outside the screen door as Ellie and Brenda squashed in among the seven Timmonses.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="留给杰斯干的活和往常一样。妈妈从来不派小的来帮忙，不过，即使他能够完成，也要让梅宝做点什么。他把头低下来，侧着枕到桌子上。今天早上的跑步累得他够呛。蒂蒙斯家那辆旧比克车的声音灌到了他朝上的那只耳朵里——他的爸爸一定会说：“该上油了。”——纱门外传来了嘁嘁喳喳快乐的声音，是艾丽和布兰达挤进了蒂蒙斯家的七个人中间。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was May Belle who came to tell him in the bean patch that people were moving into the old Perkins place down on the next farm. Jess wiped his hair out of his eyes and squinted. Sure enough. A U-Haul was parked right by the door. One of those big jointed ones. These people had a lot of junk. But they wouldn't last. The Perkins place was one of those ratty old country houses you moved into because you had no decent place to go and moved out of as quickly as you could. He thought later how peculiar it was that here was probably the biggest thing in his life, and he had shrugged it off as nothing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="是梅宝到豆田里告诉他说，有人正在搬进旁边农场里的珀金斯老宅。杰斯撩开搭在眼睛上的头发，眯着眼看。真的。一辆U型拖车正停在门边。一个大个子和其他几个大个子在一起。这些人有大量的破烂。但他们不会久住。珀金斯老宅是一所破旧的农村老房子，他们搬进去是因为找不到好地方，所以一定会尽快搬走的。过一会，他想到或许这里会有他生命中最重大的事件发生，觉得真是怪异。然后他耸了耸肩，就像从没有过这种想法一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
