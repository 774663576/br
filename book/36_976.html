<div class="line_en">From now on, her indifference to the flat was even greater. There seemed no common ground on which they could talk to one another. She let herself be asked for expenses. It became so with him that he hated to do it. He preferred standing off the butcher and baker. He ran up a grocery bill of sixteen dollars with Oeslogge, laying in a supply of staple articles, so that they would not have to buy any of those things for some time to come. Then he changed his grocery. It was the same with the butcher and several others. Carrie never heard anything of this directly from him. He asked for such as he could expect, drifting farther and farther into a situation which could have but one ending.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从这以后，她对这个家更加漠不关心了。他们之间似乎已经没有了任何相互交谈的共同基矗她总是等着他来开口问她要开支的钱。这使他十分难堪，因此他极不情愿这样做。他宁愿躲着肉铺老板和面包房老板。他向奥斯拉格赊了16块钱的食品帐，贮存了一批主要食品，这样他们在一段时间之内就不用买这些东西了。然后，他换了一家食品店。对于肉铺老板和其他几家老板，他也采用了同样的办法。这一切，嘉莉从未直接听他谈起过。他只开口要他能指望得到的东西，越来越深地陷入了只可能有一种结局的处境。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Carrie was doing better, that he knew. Her clothes were improved now, even fine. He saw her coming and going, sometimes picturing to himself her rise. Little eating had thinned him somewhat. He had no appetite. His clothes, too, were a poor man's clothes. Talk about getting something had become even too threadbare and ridiculous for him. So he folded his hands and waited -- for what, he could not anticipate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="嘉莉干得越来越好，这一点他很清楚。现在，她的衣服漂亮多了，甚至可以说得上是华丽了。他看着她进进出出，有时候自己想象她飞黄腾达的情景。他吃得很少，有些消瘦了。他没有食欲。他的衣服也已经破旧。关于要找事做的那套话，连他自己都觉得乏味可笑。因此，他就十指交叉地等待着——等待什么呢，他也无法预料。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At last, however, troubles became too thick. The hounding of creditors, the indifference of Carrie, the silence of the flat, and presence of winter, all joined to produce a climax. It was effected by the arrival of Oeslogge, personally, when Carrie was there.</div>

<div class="line_en">Hurstwood had been reading of this thing, and wondering concerning the huge tie-up which would follow. A day or two before this trouble with Carrie, it came. On a cold afternoon, when everything was grey and it threatened to snow, the papers announced that the men had been called out on all the lines. Being so utterly idle, and his mind filled with the numerous predictions which had been made concerning the scarcity of labour this winter and the panicky state of the financial market, Hurstwood read this with interest. He noted the claims of the striking motormen and conductors, who said that they had been wont to receive two dollars a day in times past, but that for a year or more "trippers" had been introduced, which cut down their chance of livelihood one-half, and increased their hours of servitude from ten to twelve, and even fourteen. These "trippers" were men put on during the busy and rush hours, to take a car out for one trip. The compensation paid for such a trip was only twenty-five cents. When the rush or busy hours were over, they were laid off. Worst of all, no man might know when he was going to get a car. He must come to the barns in the morning and wait around in fair and foul weather until such time as he was needed. Two trips were an average reward for so much waiting -- a little over three hours' work for fifty cents. The work of waiting was not counted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="赫斯渥早已从报上知道了这件事情，一直在想着罢工之后将会出现的大规模的交通瘫痪。在这次和嘉莉争吵的前一两天，罢工开始了。一个寒冷的下午，天色阴暗，眼看就要下雪了，报上宣布有轨电车工人全线罢工了。赫斯渥闲得无聊，头脑里装满了人们关于今年冬天将缺少劳动力和金融市场将出现恐慌局面的多种预测，很有兴趣地看着罢工的新闻。他注意到了罢工的司机和售票员提出的要求。他们说，过去他们一直拿着2块钱一天的工资，但是最近一年多来，出现了“临时工”，他们谋生的机会就随之减少了一半，而劳作的时间却由十个小时增加到了十二个小时，甚至是十四个小时。这些“临时工”是在繁忙和高峰的时候临时来开一次电车的工人。这样开一次车的报酬只有2毛5分钱。等高峰或繁忙时刻一过，他们就被解雇了。最糟糕的是，谁也不知道自己什么时候有车可开。他必须一早就去车场，不管好天歹天都得等在那里，直到用得着他的时候。等候这么久，平均只有开两次车的机会——三小时多一点的工作，拿5毛钱的报酬。等候的时间是不计酬的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There had been appearing in the papers about this time rumours and notices of an approaching strike on the trolley lines in Brooklyn. There was general dissatisfaction as to the hours of labour required and the wages paid. As usual -- and for some inexplicable reason -- the men chose the winter for the forcing of the hand of their employers and the settlement of their difficulties.</div>

<div class="line_en">Now he left before she did, which was a remarkable thing, and tramped eastward to Fourteenth Street and Sixth Avenue, where he took the car. He had read that scores of applicants were applying at the office of the Brooklyn City Railroad building and were being received. He made his way there by horse-car and ferry -- a dark, silent man -- to the offices in question. It was a long way, for no cars were running, and the day was cold; but he trudged along grimly. Once in Brooklyn, he could clearly see and feel that a strike was on. People showed it in their manner. Along the routes of certain tracks not a car was running. About certain corners and nearby saloons small groups of men were lounging. Several spring wagons passed him, equipped with plain wooden chairs, and labelled "Flatbush" or "Prospect Park. Fare, Ten Cents." He noticed cold and even gloomy faces. Labour was having its little war.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一次他走在她之前，这可真是一件不同寻常的事。他向东步行到十四街和第六大道的拐角处，在那里乘上了公共马车。他从报上得知有几十个人正在布鲁克林市立电车公司大楼的办公室里申请工作并受到雇用。他，一个阴郁、沉默的人，一路上又乘公共马车又搭渡船到达了前面提到过的办公室。这段路程很长，因为电车不开，天气又冷，但他还是顽强地、艰难地赶着路。一到布鲁克林，他就明显地看到和感到罢工正在进行。这一点从人们的态度上就看得出来。有些电车轨道上，沿线没有车辆在行驶。有些街角上和附近的酒店周围，小群的工人在闲荡。几辆敞篷货车从他身边驶过，车上安着普通的木椅，标有“平坦的灌木丛”或“展望公园，车费一毛”的字样。他注意到了那些冰冷甚至阴郁的面孔。工人们正在进行一场小小的战争。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When he came near the office in question, he saw a few men standing about, and some policemen. On the far corners were other men -- whom he took to be strikers -- watching. All the houses were small and wooden, the streets poorly paved. After New York, Brooklyn looked actually poor and hard-up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他走近前面提到的办公室时，他看见周围站着几个人，还有几个警察。在远处的街角上还有些别的人在观望着——他猜想那些人是罢工者。这里所有的房屋都很矮小，而且都是木结构的，街道的铺设也很简陋。和纽约相比。布鲁克林真显得寒酸而贫穷。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The offices are up those steps," said the bluecoat. His face was a very neutral thing to contemplate. In his heart of hearts, he sympathised with the strikers and hated this "scab." In his heart of hearts, also, he felt the dignity and use of the police force, which commanded order. Of its true social significance, he never once dreamed. His was not the mind for that. The two feelings blended in him -- neutralised one another and him. He would have fought for this man as determinedly as for himself, and yet only so far as commanded. Strip him of his uniform, and he would have soon picked his side.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“上了那些台阶就是办公室，”这警察说。从他的脸上看，他是毫无偏袒的。但在他的内心深处，他是同情罢工并且憎恨这个“工贼”的。然而，同样在他的内心深处，他也感受到警察的尊严和作用，警察就是要维持秩序。至于警察的真正的社会意义，他从未想过。他那种头脑是不会想到这些的。这两种感觉在他心里混为一体，相互抵消，使他采取了中立的态度。他会像为自己一样为这个人去坚决地战斗，但也只是奉命而行。一旦脱下制服，他就会立即站到自己同情的那一边去。">查看中文翻译</div>
