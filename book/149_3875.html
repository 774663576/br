<div class="line_en">Blomkvist had been fascinated by the old man's account, but when Vanger excused himself to go to the bathroom, his scepticism returned. The old man had still not got to the end, and Blomkvist had finally promised to listen to the whole story.</div>

<div class="line_en">The time limit set by Blomkvist had been exceeded by a good margin. It was 4:30, and there was no hope of catching the afternoon train, but he still had a chance of making the evening train at 9:30. He stood by the window rubbing his neck as he stared out at the illuminated facade of the church on the other side of the bridge. Vanger had shown him a scrapbook with articles from both the local newspaper and the national media. There had been quite a bit of media interest for a while -- girl from noted industrialist's family disappears. But when no body was found and there was no breakthrough in the investigation, interest gradually waned. Despite the fact that a prominent family was involved, thirty-six years later the case of Harriet Vanger was all but forgotten. The prevailing theory in articles from the late sixties seemed to be that she drowned and was swept out to sea -- a tragedy, but something that could happen to any family.</div>

<div class="line_en">"What do you think happened to her?" he said when Vanger came back into the room. "Normally there were some twenty-five people living here year-round, but because of the family gathering there were more than sixty on Hedeby Island that day. Of these, between twenty and twenty-five can be ruled out, pretty much so. I believe that of those remaining, someone -- and in all likelihood it was someone from the family -- killed Harriet and hid the body."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你觉得她出了什么事？”等范耶尔回到书房后，他问道。“正常来说，一年到头都住在海泽比岛上的大约只有二十五人，但因为家庭聚会之故，当天这里出现了六十几个人。这其中差不多有二十至二十五人可以除外。我相信剩下的人当中，有人——而且非常可能是家族里的人——杀害了海莉藏起尸体。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I have a dozen objections to that."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对这点我有十几点疑义。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, the first one is that even if someone hid her body, it should have been found if the search was as thorough as the one you described."</div>

<div class="line_en">"To tell you the truth, the search was even more extensive than I've described. It wasn't until I began to think of Harriet as a murder victim that I realised several ways in which her body could have disappeared. I can't prove this, but it's at least within the realm of possibility."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“说实话，搜索的范围比我说得还要广。一直到后来我开始觉得海莉可能遭人杀害，才发觉凶手有几个毁尸灭迹的方法。我无法证明，但至少不无可能。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Harriet went missing sometime around 3:00 that afternoon. At about 2:55 she was seen by Pastor Falk, who was hurrying to the bridge. At almost exactly the same time a photographer arrived from the local paper, and for the next hour he took a great number of pictures of the drama. We -- the police, I mean -- examined the photographs and confirmed that Harriet was not in any one of them; but every other person in town was seen in at least one, apart from very small children."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“海莉是在当天下午三点左右失踪。两点五十五分前后，正赶往桥边的法尔克牧师还见到她。几乎就在同一时间，地方报的一名摄影记者也来到现场，并在接下来一个小时内拍了许许多多车祸的照片。我们——我是说警察——检视过所有照片，证实海莉并不在其中；但城里的每个人，除了幼童之外，都至少上过一张照片。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"These are pictures from that day. The first one was taken in Hedestad during the Children's Day parade. The same photographer took it around 1:15 p. m., and Harriet is there in it."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="范耶尔又拿出一本相簿放到桌上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The photograph was taken from the second floor of a building and showed a street along which the parade -- clowns on trucks and girls in bathing suits -- had just passed. Spectators thronged the pavements. Vanger pointed at a figure in the crowd.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这张照片是从某栋建筑物二楼拍摄的，除了街景还有刚刚通过的游行队伍——载着小丑的卡车和穿着清凉的女孩。人行道上挤满围观群众。范耶尔指着人群中的一人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That's Harriet. It's about two hours before she will disappear; she's with some of her schoolfriends in town. This is the last picture taken of her. But there's one more interesting shot."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那是海莉。这大概是她失踪前两个小时，她和几个同学进城去了。这也是她最后一张照片。不过还有一张更有趣。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Vanger leafed through the pages. The album contained about 180 pictures -- five rolls -- from the crash on the bridge. After having heard the account, it was almost too much to suddenly see it in the form of sharp black-and-white images. The photographer was a professional who had managed to capture the turmoil surrounding the accident. A large number of the pictures focused on the activities around the overturned tanker truck. Blomkvist had no problem identifying a gesticulating, much younger Henrik Vanger soaked with heating oil.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="范耶尔一页页地翻开。相簿里大概有一百八十张（六卷）相片拍的是桥上的车祸场面。在听了那么多描述后，乍看到清晰的黑白影像竟有点不适应。这位摄影记者很专业，成功地捕捉到事故现场的混乱情景。有大量照片针对的是人们在翻覆的油罐车旁的一举一动。布隆维斯特马上就认出比现在年轻许多、全身被高温油料浸湿的范耶尔，正比手画脚地指挥着。">查看中文翻译</div>

Take a look at the house, the middle second floor window. That's Harriet's room. In the preceding picture the window was closed. Here it's open."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“有趣的相片在这里。”范耶尔说：“据我们推断，这是在三点四十至三点四十五分之间拍的，也就是海莉遇见法尔克后四十五分钟左右。看看那栋屋子，二楼中间那扇窗。那是海莉的房间。前一张照片里，窗子还关着，这时却是打开的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Harriet disappeared sometime around 3:00 or shortly thereafter. These pictures give an impression of where certain people were at that time. That's why I can eliminate a number of people from the list of suspects. For the same reason I can conclude that some people who were not in the photographs at that time must be added to the list of suspects."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“海莉在三点左右或刚过不久失踪。从这些照片大概能知道某些人当时在哪里，所以才能将一部分人从嫌疑名单中删除。同样地，我也可以断定当时不在照片中的人必须列入名单。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There are actually several very practical ways it could have been done. Sometime around 3:00 the killer struck. He or she presumably didn't use any sort of weapon -- or we would have found traces of blood. I'm guessing that Harriet was strangled and I'm guessing that it happened here -- behind the wall in the courtyard, somewhere out of the photographer's line of sight and in a blind spot from the house. There's a path, if you want to take a shortcut, to the parsonage -- the last place she was seen -- and back to the house. Today there's a small flower bed and lawn there, but in the sixties it was a gravelled area used for parking. All the killer had to do was open the boot of a car and put Harriet inside. When we began searching the island the next day, nobody was thinking that a crime had been committed. We focused on the shorelines, the buildings, and the woods closest to the village."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“的确有几种方式非常可行。三点左右凶手下手。他或她应该没有使用任何凶器，否则便会追踪到血迹。我猜海莉是被勒毙，而且可能就在这里——在墙背后的院子，在摄影记者视线不能及、从房子也看不见的死角。那里有一条连接牧师住所与我们家的小路一，那是最后有人见到她的地方。现在那里整理成小花坛和草地，但在六十年代却是碎石铺地的停车场。因此凶手只需打开车的后备箱，把海莉放进去。第二天搜索岛上时，谁也没想到发生命案，所以将重点放在海岸边、建筑物和最靠近村子的树林。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"To be completely honest with you, Harriet's disappearance was the reason why gradually I withdrew from the firm's management. I lost all motivation. I knew that there was a killer somewhere nearby and the worrying and searching for the truth began to affect my work. The worst thing is that the burden didn't get any lighter over time -- on the contrary. Around 1970 I had a period when I just wanted to be left alone. Then Martin joined the board of directors, and he had to take on more and more of my work. In 1976 I retired and Martin took over as CEO. I still have a seat on the board, but I haven't sailed many knots since I turned fifty. For the last thirty-six years not a day has passed that I have not pondered Harriet's disappearance. You may think I'm obsessed with it -- at least most of my relatives think so."</div>

She suspected that Armansky hoped that this way he would have a chance to keep an eye on her and meddle in her affairs.
