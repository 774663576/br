<div class="line_en">Robert Langdon lay on a bed of coins at the bottom of theFountain of the Four Rivers. His mouth was still wrapped around the plastic hose. The air being pumped through thespumanti tube to froth the fountain had been polluted by the pump, and his throat burned. He was not complaining, though. He was alive.</div>

<div class="line_en">He was not sure how accurate his imitation of a drowning man had been, but having been around water his entire life, Langdon had certainly heard accounts. He had done his best. Near the end, he had even blown all the air from his lungs and stopped breathing so that his muscle mass would carry his body to the floor.</div>

<div class="line_en">Now, resting on the bottom of the fountain, Langdon had waited as long as he could wait. He was about to start choking. He wondered if the Hassassin was still out there. Taking an acrid breath from the tube, Langdon let go and swam across the bottom of the fountain until he found the smooth swell of the central core. Silently, he followed it upward, surfacing out of sight, in the shadows beneath the huge marble figures.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此时，停歇在喷泉池底，兰登尽可能等久一点。他快要窒息了，很想知道哈撒辛是不是还在那裡。兰登从管子裡吸了口辛辣的空气，鬆开手，游过喷泉底部，找到喷泉中央平滑的隆起部份。然后他悄然沿著那块隆起处往上，就在巨大的大理石雕像阴影下方，他偷偷浮出了水面。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That was all Langdon needed to see. Pulling a long breath of fresh air back into his lungs, he scrambled back toward where Cardinal Baggia had gone down. Langdon knew the man would be unconscious now, and chances of revival were slim, but he had to try. When Langdon found the body, he planted his feet on either side, reached down, and grabbed the chains wrapped around the cardinal. Then Langdon pulled. When the cardinal broke water, Langdon could see the eyes were already rolled upward, bulging. Not a good sign. There was no breath or pulse.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登唯一要看的就是这个。他吸了一大口新鲜的空气后，又手脚并用游回巴吉亚枢机主教沉下去那裡。兰登知道枢机主教现在应该已经失去意识了，醒来的机会很低，但他得试试看。兰登找到那具身躯，他站稳双脚，双手往下抓起缠绕在枢机主教身上的铁鍊，然后用力拉。枢机主教终于露出水面时，兰登看到他的双眼已经上翻，往外暴凸。不是好迹象。他已经没有呼吸，也探不到脉搏了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then he went to work. Compressing the cardinal's chain-clad chest, Langdon pumped the water from his lungs. Then he began CPR. Counting carefully. Deliberately. Resisting the instinct to blow too hard and too fast. For three minutes Langdon tried to revive the old man. After five minutes, Langdon knew it was over.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后他开始动手。兰登朝枢机主教被铁鍊缠绕的胸膛下压，把水压出他的肺，然后开始做心肺复甦术。谨慎算著数字，小心翼翼，抗拒著想吹得太用力或压得太快的衝动。前三分钟，兰登还指望能救活这个老人。五分钟后，他知道一切结束了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Knowing he could never get the body up and over the fountain rim, Langdon lugged Cardinal Baggia through the water and into the hollow beneath the central mound of marble. Here the water became shallow, and there was an inclined ledge. Langdon dragged the naked body up onto the ledge as far as he could. Not far.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登知道他绝对没办法把尸体抬出喷泉池外，于是使劲拉著巴吉亚枢机主教游过水面，来到喷泉中央大理石堆下头的中空处。这裡的水比较浅，还有个倾斜的岩架。兰登把赤裸的尸体尽量拖上岩架，但没拖上去多少。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Gently, Langdon ran a hand across the man's face and closed his upturned eyes. As he did, he felt an exhausted shudder of tears well from within. It startled him. Then, for the first time in years, Langdon cried.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登伸出一隻手，轻轻拂过老人的脸，把他往上翻的双眼阖上。此时筋疲力尽又颤抖著，他忽然感到眼泪冒上来。他愣住了，然后，好多年来第一次，兰登哭了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Somehow, even now, prostrate in the shadows on the semisubmerged ledge, Cardinal Baggia retained an air of quiet dignity. The water lapped softly across his chest, seeming almost remorseful… as if asking forgiveness for being the man's ultimate killer… as if trying to cleanse the scalded wound that bore its name.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，即使是现在，躺在阴影裡半没入水中的岩架上，巴吉亚枢机主教仍保持著一种沉静又庄严的气质。水轻轻拍打著他的胸膛，简直像是在自责……彷彿因成为淹死这位老人的最终凶手而祈求宽恕……彷彿想洗净写著它名字的那个伤口。">查看中文翻译</div>
