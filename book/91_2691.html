<div class="line_en">Still, the sun was hot. Still, one got over things. Still, life had a way of adding day to day. Still, he thought, yawning and beginning to take notice -- Regent's Park had changed very little since he was a boy, except for the squirrels -- still, presumably there were compensations -- when little Elise Mitchell, who had been picking up pebbles to add to the pebble collection which she and her brother were making on the nursery mantelpiece, plumped her handful down on the nurse's knee and scudded off again full tilt into a lady's legs. Peter Walsh laughed out.</div>

<div class="line_en">Slightly waved by tears the broad path, the nurse, the man in grey, the perambulator, rose and fell before her eyes. To be rocked by this malignant torturer was her lot. But why?

<div class="line_en">She frowned; she stamped her foot. She must go back again to Septimus since it was almost time for them to be going to Sir William Bradshaw. She must go back and tell him, go back to him sitting there on the green chair under the tree, talking to himself, or to that dead man Evans, whom she had only seen once for a moment in the shop. He had seemed a nice quiet man; a great friend of Septimus's, and he had been killed in the War. But such things happen to every one. Every one has friends who were killed in the War. Every one gives up something when they marry. She had given up her home. She had come to live here, in this awful city. But Septimus let himself think about horrible things, as she could too, if she tried. He had grown stranger and stranger. He said people were talking behind the bedroom walls. Mrs. Filmer thought it odd. He saw things too -- he had seen an old woman's head in the middle of a fern. Yet he could be happy when he chose. They went to Hampton Court on top of a bus, and they were perfectly happy. All the little red and yellow flowers were out on the grass, like floating lamps he said, and talked and chattered and laughed, making up stories. Suddenly he said, "Now we will kill ourselves," when they were standing by the river, and he looked at it with a look which she had seen in his eyes when a train went by, or an omnibus -- a look as if something fascinated him; and she felt he was going from her and she caught him by the arm. But going home he was perfectly quiet -- perfectly reasonable. He would argue with her about killing themselves; and explain how wicked people were; how he could see them making up lies as they passed in the street. He knew all their thoughts, he said; he knew everything. He knew the meaning of the world, he said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她凝眉，她跺足。她必须再次回到赛普提默斯那里，因为他们去威廉·布莱德肖爵士那里的时间快到了。她必须返回去告诉他，必须回到他那里。他坐在树下的绿椅子上，自言自语，或者是在和死去的埃文斯交谈，她只在一家商店里和此人有过匆匆的一面之缘。他看上去是个沉默寡言的好人，是赛普提默斯的好朋友，在战场上牺牲了。可这样的事每个人都会遭遇到。每个人都有牺牲在战场上的好友。每个人在结婚时都必须放弃点什么。她放弃了自己的家。她来到这里，住在这个糟糕的城市里。可赛普提默斯放任自己想那些可怕的事，如果她想，她也可以这样呀。他变得越来越古怪了。他说有人在卧室的墙壁里面说话。菲尔默太太觉得他的话匪夷所思。他还会看见幻象——他在一株蕨草中看见了一个老妇人的脑袋。然而，只要他想，他还是能够得到快乐的。有次，他们坐在巴士顶层上去汉普顿宫[34]游玩，就玩得很带劲。草地上开满了小红花与小黄花，他说它们如漂浮的灯火，他喜笑颜开，说个不停，还编造了许多故事。可突然，他又说道：“让我们去自杀吧。”当时他们站在河岸边，他看着河水的眼神真是奇特，当一列火车或一辆巴士从他们身边开过时，她也曾看见过他眼里的这种神色——一种似乎被什么东西蛊惑住了的眼神。她感觉他正在离她而去，于是她抓住了他的胳膊。可回家途中他又变得沉默寡言——变得非常理智。他会和她讨论一起去自杀的事，还解释说人类是多么邪恶，当人们在街上和他擦肩而过时，他一眼就能看出他们都是喜欢说谎的人。他说他洞悉他们所有的想法，因为他了解一切。他还说他了解这个世界的意义。【注：[34]位于伦敦近郊泰晤士河滨的游览胜地，是亨利八世的宫殿。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then when they got back he could hardly walk. He lay on the sofa and made her hold his hand to prevent him from falling down, down, he cried, into the flames! and saw faces laughing at him, calling him horrible disgusting names, from the walls, and hands pointing round the screen. Yet they were quite alone. But he began to talk aloud, answering people, arguing, laughing, crying, getting very excited and making her write things down. Perfect nonsense it was; about death; about Miss Isabel Pole. She could stand it no longer. She would go back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后来，他们回到家后，他几乎就不能走路了。他躺在沙发上，让她握紧他的手，别让他掉下去，掉下去，他高喊着，别让他掉进了底下的火海！他看见墙上有嘲笑他的鬼脸，那张脸在用各种恶毒龌龊的话骂他，纱窗上有无数只手在对他指指戳戳。然而房间里除了他们俩并没有别人。可他开始大声说话，回答着别人的问题，争论着，笑着，喊着，把自己弄得兴奋无比，还让她把他的话记下来。那纯粹就是胡言乱语，关于死亡，关于伊莎贝尔·波尔小姐。她再也受不了了，她要回家去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He dropped her hand. Their marriage was over, he thought, with agony, with relief. The rope was cut; he mounted; he was free, as it was decreed that he, Septimus, the lord of men, should be free; alone (since his wife had thrown away her wedding ring; since she had left him), he, Septimus, was alone, called forth in advance of the mass of men to hear the truth, to learn the meaning, which now at last, after all the toils of civilisation -- Greeks, Romans, Shakespeare, Darwin, and now himself -- was to be given whole to…"To whom?" he asked aloud. "To the Prime Minister," the voices which rustled above his head replied. The supreme secret must be told to the Cabinet; first that trees are alive; next there is no crime; next love, universal love, he muttered, gasping, trembling, painfully drawing out these profound truths which needed, so deep were they, so difficult, an immense effort to speak out, but the world was entirely changed by them for ever.</div>

<div class="line_en">Heaven was divinely merciful, infinitely benignant. It spared him, pardoned his weakness. But what was the scientific explanation (for one must be scientific above all things)? Why could he see through bodies, see into the future, when dogs will become men? It was the heat wave presumably, operating upon a brain made sensitive by eons of evolution. Scientifically speaking, the flesh was melted off the world. His body was macerated until only the nerve fibres were left. It was spread like a veil upon a rock.</div>

<div class="line_en">He lay back in his chair, exhausted but upheld. He lay resting, waiting, before he again interpreted, with effort, with agony, to mankind. He lay very high, on the back of the world. The earth thrilled beneath him. Red flowers grew through his flesh; their stiff leaves rustled by his head. Music began clanging against the rocks up here. It is a motor horn down in the street, he muttered; but up here it cannoned from rock to rock, divided, met in shocks of sound which rose in smooth columns (that music should be visible was a discovery) and became an anthem, an anthem twined round now by a shepherd boy's piping (That's an old man playing a penny whistle by the public-house, he muttered) which, as the boy stood still came bubbling from his pipe, and then, as he climbed higher, made its exquisite plaint while the traffic passed beneath. This boy's elegy is played among the traffic, thought Septimus. Now he withdraws up into the snows, and roses hang about him -- the thick red roses which grow on my bedroom wall, he reminded himself. The music stopped. He has his penny, he reasoned it out, and has gone on to the next public-house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他靠回到椅子上，筋疲力尽却又亢奋不已。他靠在那里休息着，等待着，直到再次恢复力气，去痛苦地向人类作出解释。他躺在高高的巅峰，躺在世界屋脊之上。大地在他脚下战栗。红花从他的肉体里长出来，僵硬的叶片在他的脑袋边簌簌作响。叮当的乐声响起，敲打着这里的岩石。那是远处街道上的汽车喇叭声，他嘟哝道。但在这儿，音乐在岩石间轰鸣，扩散开去，又在声波的震动中凝聚起来，光滑的音柱袅袅升腾（音乐也是看得见的，那可是个新发现），成为了一首赞歌，此时牧童的笛声也加入了进来（那其实是一个老头在酒吧门口吹着哨笛[36]，他嘟哝道），牧童静立在那里，乐声从笛子里涌出，之后，自己爬到了更高的地方，听到笛声变得哀婉动人，听到底下嘈杂的车流声。牧童的悲歌交织着车流的杂沓，赛普提默斯想道。此时，他退隐至雪山之巅，玫瑰高悬在他的四围——它是盛开在我卧室墙上的大朵的红玫瑰，他提醒自己说。乐声戛然而止。他如此推断，那老头定是讨到了钱，去下一家酒吧了。【注：[36]Pennywhistle，一种六音孔的玩具哨笛。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But he himself remained high on his rock, like a drowned sailor on a rock. I leant over the edge of the boat and fell down, he thought. I went under the sea. I have been dead, and yet am now alive, but let me rest still; he begged (he was talking to himself again -- it was awful, awful!); and as, before waking, the voices of birds and the sound of wheels chime and chatter in a queer harmony, grow louder and louder and the sleeper feels himself drawing to the shores of life, so he felt himself drawing towards life, the sun growing hotter, cries sounding louder, something tremendous about to happen.</div>

<div class="line_en">He had only to open his eyes; but a weight was on them; a fear. He strained; he pushed; he looked; he saw Regent's Park before him. Long streamers of sunlight fawned at his feet. The trees waved, brandished. We welcome, the world seemed to say; we accept; we create. Beauty, the world seemed to say. And as if to prove it (scientifically) wherever he looked at the houses, at the railings, at the antelopes stretching over the palings, beauty sprang instantly. To watch a leaf quivering in the rush of air was an exquisite joy. Up in the sky swallows swooping, swerving, flinging themselves in and out, round and round, yet always with perfect control as if elastics held them; and the flies rising and falling; and the sun spotting now this leaf, now that, in mockery, dazzling it with soft gold in pure good temper; and now and again some chime (it might be a motor horn) tinkling divinely on the grass stalks -- all of this, calm and reasonable as it was, made out of ordinary things as it was, was the truth now; beauty, that was the truth now.

The amusing thing about coming back to England, after five years, was the way it made, anyhow the first days, things stand out as if one had never seen them before; lovers squabbling under a tree; the domestic family life of the parks. Never had he seen London look so enchanting -- the softness of the distances; the richness; the greenness; the civilisation, after India, he thought, strolling across the grass.</div>

<div class="line_en">Those five years --1918 to 1923-- had been, he suspected, somehow very important. People looked different. Newspapers seemed different. Now for instance there was a man writing quite openly in one of the respectable weeklies about water-closets. That you couldn't have done ten years ago -- written quite openly about water- closets in a respectable weekly. And then this taking out a stick of rouge, or a powder-puff and making up in public. On board ship coming home there were lots of young men and girls -- Betty and Bertie he remembered in particular -- carrying on quite openly; the old mother sitting and watching them with her knitting, cool as a cucumber. The girl would stand still and powder her nose in front of every one. And they weren't engaged; just having a good time; no feelings hurt on either side. As hard as nails she was -- Betty What'shername --; but a thorough good sort. She would make a very good wife at thirty -- she would marry when it suited her to marry; marry some rich man and live in a large house near Manchester.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那五年——从1918年到1923年——大概是最为关键的五年吧，他估计。人们看上去和以前不同了。报纸也看上去不同了。如今，比方说，有个人在一份有分量的周刊上公开发表了他对厕所的意见。十年前你是不可能那么做的——在一份有名的周刊上公然写什么厕所的事。还有就是在公共场合掏出一支口红，或一块粉扑打扮起来。在归乡的轮船上有许多年轻男女——他印象特别深刻的有贝蒂和伯迪——公开地打情骂俏，老母亲坐在一旁织着绒线，看在眼里却无动于衷。姑娘则静静地站在那里，在众目睽睽之下往鼻子上抹粉。而且他们也不兴订婚，只要开心就好，对哪一方都不会造成感情伤害。像她那么冷酷的人——贝蒂，是叫这个名字吧——，但也是个绝对的好人，到三十岁时，她会做个贤妻良母——等到时机合适她就会结婚的，嫁个阔老公，住在曼彻斯特附近的大房子里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This susceptibility to impressions had been his undoing no doubt. Still at his age he had, like a boy or a girl even, these alternations of mood; good days, bad days, for no reason whatever, happiness from a pretty face, downright misery at the sight of a frump. After India of course one fell in love with every woman one met. There was a freshness about them; even the poorest dressed better than five years ago surely; and to his eye the fashions had never been so becoming; the long black cloaks; the slimness; the elegance; and then the delicious and apparently universal habit of paint. Every woman, even the most respectable, had roses blooming under glass; lips cut with a knife; curls of Indian ink; there was design, art, everywhere; a change of some sort had undoubtedly taken place. What did the young people think about? Peter Walsh asked himself.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sally, to do her justice, saw through all that. One of the things he remembered best was an argument one Sunday morning at Bourton about women's rights (that antediluvian topic), when Sally suddenly lost her temper, flared up, and told Hugh that he represented all that was most detestable in British middle-class life. She told him that she considered him responsible for the state of "those poor girls in Piccadilly"-- Hugh, the perfect gentleman, poor Hugh!-- never did a man look more horrified! She did it on purpose she said afterwards (for they used to get together in the vegetable garden and compare notes). "He's read nothing, thought nothing, felt nothing," he could hear her saying in that very emphatic voice which carried so much farther than she knew. The stable boys had more life in them than Hugh, she said. He was a perfect specimen of the public school type, she said. No country but England could have produced him. She was really spiteful, for some reason; had some grudge against him. Something had happened -- he forgot what -- in the smoking-room. He had insulted her -- kissed her? Incredible! Nobody believed a word against Hugh of course. Who could? Kissing Sally in the smoking-room! If it had been some Honourable Edith or Lady Violet, perhaps; but not that ragamuffin Sally without a penny to her name, and a father or a mother gambling at Monte Carlo. For of all the people he had ever met Hugh was the greatest snob -- the most obsequious -- no, he didn't cringe exactly. He was too much of a prig for that. A first-rate valet was the obvious comparison -- somebody who walked behind carrying suit cases; could be trusted to send telegrams -- indispensable to hostesses. And he'd found his job -- married his Honourable Evelyn; got some little post at Court, looked after the King's cellars, polished the Imperial shoe- buckles, went about in knee-breeches and lace ruffles. How remorseless life is! A little job at Court!</div>

You had to go and look at them -- you had to spend a great deal of time always admiring whatever it was -- linen cupboards, pillow-cases, old oak furniture, pictures, which Hugh had picked up for an old song. But Mrs. Hugh sometimes gave the show away. She was one of those obscure mouse-like little women who admire big men. She was almost negligible. Then suddenly she would say something quite unexpected -- something sharp. She had the relics of the grand manner perhaps. The steam coal was a little too strong for her -- it made the atmosphere thick. And so there they lived, with their linen cupboards and their old masters and their pillow-cases fringed with real lace at the rate of five or ten thousand a year presumably, while he, who was two years older than Hugh, cadged for a job.</div>

But one must do Clarissa justice. She wasn't going to marry Hugh anyhow. She had a perfectly clear notion of what she wanted. Her emotions were all on the surface. Beneath, she was very shrewd -- a far better judge of character than Sally, for instance, and with it all, purely feminine; with that extraordinary gift, that woman's gift, of making a world of her own wherever she happened to be. She came into a room; she stood, as he had often seen her, in a doorway with lots of people round her. But it was Clarissa one remembered.

He only felt, after seeing her that morning, among her scissors and silks, making ready for the party, unable to get away from the thought of her; she kept coming back and back like a sleeper jolting against him in a railway carriage; which was not being in love, of course; it was thinking of her, criticising her, starting again, after thirty years, trying to explain her. The obvious thing to say of her was that she was worldly; cared too much for rank and society and getting on in the world -- which was true in a sense; she had admitted it to him. (You could always get her to own up if you took the trouble; she was honest.) What she would say was that she hated frumps, fogies, failures, like himself presumably; thought people had no right to slouch about with their hands in their pockets; must do something, be something; and these great swells, these Duchesses, these hoary old Countesses one met in her drawing- room, unspeakably remote as he felt them to be from anything that mattered a straw, stood for something real to her. Lady Bexborough, she said once, held herself upright (so did Clarissa herself; she never lounged in any sense of the word; she was straight as a dart, a little rigid in fact). She said they had a kind of courage which the older she grew the more she respected. In all this there was a great deal of Dalloway, of course; a great deal of the public-spirited, British Empire, tariff-reform, governing-class spirit, which had grown on her, as it tends to do. With twice his wits, she had to see things through his eyes -- one of the tragedies of married life. With a mind of her own, she must always be quoting Richard -- as if one couldn't know to a tittle what Richard thought by reading the Morning Post of a morning! These parties for example were all for him, or for her idea of him (to do Richard justice he would have been happier farming in Norfolk). She made her drawing-room a sort of meeting-place; she had a genius for it. Over and over again he had seen her take some raw youth, twist him, turn him, wake him up; set him going. Infinite numbers of dull people conglomerated round her of course. But odd unexpected people turned up; an artist sometimes; sometimes a writer; queer fish in that atmosphere. And behind it all was that network of visiting, leaving cards, being kind to people; running about with bunches of flowers, little presents; So-and-so was going to France -- must have an air-cushion; a real drain on her strength; all that interminable traffic that women of her sort keep up; but she did it genuinely, from a natural instinct.</div>

To see your own sister killed by a falling tree (all Justin Parry's fault -- all his carelessness) before your very eyes, a girl too on the verge of life, the most gifted of them, Clarissa always said, was enough to turn one bitter. Later she wasn't so positive perhaps; she thought there were no Gods; no one was to blame; and so she evolved this atheist's religion of doing good for the sake of goodness.</div>

<div class="line_en">And of course she enjoyed life immensely. It was her nature to enjoy (though goodness only knows, she had her reserves; it was a mere sketch, he often felt, that even he, after all these years, could make of Clarissa). Anyhow there was no bitterness in her; none of that sense of moral virtue which is so repulsive in good women. She enjoyed practically everything. If you walked with her in Hyde Park now it was a bed of tulips, now a child in a perambulator, now some absurd little drama she made up on the spur of the moment. (Very likely, she would have talked to those lovers, if she had thought them unhappy.) She had a sense of comedy that was really exquisite, but she needed people, always people, to bring it out, with the inevitable result that she frittered her time away, lunching, dining, giving these incessant parties of hers, talking nonsense, sayings things she didn't mean, blunting the edge of her mind, losing her discrimination. There she would sit at the head of the table taking infinite pains with some old buffer who might be useful to Dalloway -- they knew the most appalling bores in Europe -- or in came Elizabeth and everything must give way to HER. She was at a High School, at the inarticulate stage last time he was over, a round-eyed, pale-faced girl, with nothing of her mother in her, a silent stolid creature, who took it all as a matter of course, let her mother make a fuss of her, and then said "May I go now?" like a child of four; going off, Clarissa explained, with that mixture of amusement and pride which Dalloway himself seemed to rouse in her, to play hockey. And now Elizabeth was "out," presumably; thought him an old fogy, laughed at her mother's friends. Ah well, so be it. The compensation of growing old, Peter Walsh thought, coming out of Regent's Park, and holding his hat in hand, was simply this; that the passions remain as strong as ever, but one has gained -- at last!-- the power which adds the supreme flavour to existence,-- the power of taking hold of experience, of turning it round, slowly, in the light.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然啰，她非常享受生活。活得开心是她的天性（尽管只有天知道，她也有保守的一面。他常常感觉，即使是和她交往了这么多年的他，也只能画出克拉丽莎的一点点轮廓）。总之，她的天性里没有抱怨，没有贤惠女人身上那种令人讨厌的仁义道德。她几乎能享受一切。如果你此时正与她散步在海德公园[42]，花坛里的郁金香、童车里的婴儿都会让她心情大好，在这种心情的刺激下，她会编造出可笑的小故事（如果她觉得那些情侣们不快乐，她很有可能会去和他们聊上几句安慰一下的）。她有一种极其细腻的喜剧感，可她需要别人，总是需要别人，去把它激发出来，这就造成了无法避免的后果，就是白白地浪费掉许多时间，午餐、晚餐，她的派对永不落幕，说着无聊的话，言不由衷的话，把自己的大脑弄得昏昏沉沉，丧失了敏锐的辨别力。她会坐在桌子的首席，跟某个也许对达洛维有用的老家伙苦苦纠缠——他们认识全欧洲所有最令人讨厌的角色——或者伊丽莎白正好走进来，那么一切都必须为她让路了。他最后一次去达洛维家的时候，伊丽莎白还是个高中生，正处在笨嘴拙舌的阶段，她是个眼睛圆圆的、脸色苍白的姑娘，跟她母亲没有半点相像的地方。她是一个沉默寡言、感觉迟钝的姑娘，把一切都认为是理所应当，任她母亲在她身上发泄一阵母爱之后，她会像个四岁的小孩子一般说道：“我现在可以走了吗？”她跑掉后，克拉丽莎解释说，伊丽莎白去打曲棍球了。脸上带着混合了快乐与骄傲的表情，这样的表情似乎是达洛维本人给她的影响。如今伊丽莎白想必已经“进入了社交界”，因而会嘲笑她母亲的朋友，会认为他是个老古董。那么好吧，就这样吧。彼德·沃尔什走出摄政公园，手里拿着帽子，就是简简单单的这个，心里想，人老后得到的报偿只有一点：热情依然保留得如以前一般强烈，不过你得到了——终于！——使生活增添无上滋味的力量——把握经验的力量，这力量使生活流畅地运转起来，慢慢地，在阳光下品味。【注：[42]伦敦最著名的皇家公园，位于市中心的威斯敏斯特教堂地区。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A terrible confession it was (he put his hat on again), but now, at the age of fifty-three one scarcely needed people any more. Life itself, every moment of it, every drop of it, here, this instant, now, in the sun, in Regent's Park, was enough. Too much indeed. A whole lifetime was too short to bring out, now that one had acquired the power, the full flavour; to extract every ounce of pleasure, every shade of meaning; which both were so much more solid than they used to be, so much less personal. It was impossible that he should ever suffer again as Clarissa had made him suffer. For hours at a time (pray God that one might say these things without being overheard!), for hours and days he never thought of Daisy.</div>

<div class="line_en">Could it be that he was in love with her then, remembering the misery, the torture, the extraordinary passion of those days? It was a different thing altogether -- a much pleasanter thing -- the truth being, of course, that now SHE was in love with HIM. And that perhaps was the reason why, when the ship actually sailed, he felt an extraordinary relief, wanted nothing so much as to be alone; was annoyed to find all her little attentions -- cigars, notes, a rug for the voyage -- in his cabin. Every one if they were honest would say the same; one doesn't want people after fifty; one doesn't want to go on telling women they are pretty; that's what most men of fifty would say, Peter Walsh thought, if they were honest.</div>

<div class="line_en">But then these astonishing accesses of emotion -- bursting into tears this morning, what was all that about? What could Clarissa have thought of him? thought him a fool presumably, not for the first time. It was jealousy that was at the bottom of it -- jealousy which survives every other passion of mankind, Peter Walsh thought, holding his pocket-knife at arm's length. She had been meeting Major Orde, Daisy said in her last letter; said it on purpose he knew; said it to make him jealous; he could see her wrinkling her forehead as she wrote, wondering what she could say to hurt him; and yet it made no difference; he was furious! All this pother of coming to England and seeing lawyers wasn't to marry her, but to prevent her from marrying anybody else. That was what tortured him, that was what came over him when he saw Clarissa so calm, so cold, so intent on her dress or whatever it was; realising what she might have spared him, what she had reduced him to -- a whimpering, snivelling old ass. But women, he thought, shutting his pocket- knife, don't know what passion is. They don't know the meaning of it to men. Clarissa was as cold as an icicle. There she would sit on the sofa by his side, let him take her hand, give him one kiss -- Here he was at the crossing.</div>

But the passage of ages had blurred the clarity of that ancient May day; the bright petalled flowers were hoar and silver frosted; and she no longer saw, when she implored him (as she did now quite clearly) "look in my eyes with thy sweet eyes intently," she no longer saw brown eyes, black whiskers or sunburnt face but only a looming shape, a shadow shape, to which, with the bird-like freshness of the very aged she still twittered "give me your hand and let me press it gently" (Peter Walsh couldn't help giving the poor creature a coin as he stepped into his taxi), "and if some one should see, what matter they?" she demanded; and her fist clutched at her side, and she smiled, pocketing her shilling, and all peering inquisitive eyes seemed blotted out, and the passing generations -- the pavement was crowded with bustling middle-class people -- vanished, like leaves, to be trodden under, to be soaked and steeped and made mould of by that eternal spring --</div>

He thought her beautiful, believed her impeccably wise; dreamed of her, wrote poems to her, which, ignoring the subject, she corrected in red ink; he saw her, one summer evening, walking in a green dress in a square.

<div class="line_en">Septimus was one of the first to volunteer. He went to France to save an England which consisted almost entirely of Shakespeare's plays and Miss Isabel Pole in a green dress walking in a square. There in the trenches the change which Mr. Brewer desired when he advised football was produced instantly; he developed manliness; he was promoted; he drew the attention, indeed the affection of his officer, Evans by name. It was a case of two dogs playing on a hearth-rug; one worrying a paper screw, snarling, snapping, giving a pinch, now and then, at the old dog's ear; the other lying somnolent, blinking at the fire, raising a paw, turning and growling good-temperedly. They had to be together, share with each other, fight with each other, quarrel with each other. But when Evans (Rezia who had only seen him once called him "a quiet man," a sturdy red-haired man, undemonstrative in the company of women), when Evans was killed, just before the Armistice, in Italy, Septimus, far from showing any emotion or recognising that here was the end of a friendship, congratulated himself upon feeling very little and very reasonably. The War had taught him. It was sublime. He had gone through the whole show, friendship, European War, death, had won promotion, was still under thirty and was bound to survive. He was right there. The last shells missed him. He watched them explode with indifference. When peace came he was in Milan, billeted in the house of an innkeeper with a courtyard, flowers in tubs, little tables in the open, daughters making hats, and to Lucrezia, the younger daughter, he became engaged one evening when the panic was on him -- that he could not feel.</div>

Still, scissors rapping, girls laughing, hats being made protected him; he was assured of safety; he had a refuge. But he could not sit there all night. There were moments of waking in the early morning. The bed was falling; he was falling. Oh for the scissors and the lamplight and the buckram shapes!

Even taste (Rezia liked ices, chocolates, sweet things) had no relish to him. He put down his cup on the little marble table. He looked at people outside; happy they seemed, collecting in the middle of the street, shouting, laughing, squabbling over nothing. But he could not taste, he could not feel. In the tea-shop among the tables and the chattering waiters the appalling fear came over him -- he could not feel. He could reason; he could read, Dante for example, quite easily ("Septimus, do put down your book," said Rezia, gently shutting the Inferno), he could add up his bill; his brain was perfect; it must be the fault of the world then -- that he could not feel.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dr. Holmes came again. Large, fresh coloured, handsome, flicking his boots, looking in the glass, he brushed it all aside -- headaches, sleeplessness, fears, dreams -- nerve symptoms and nothing more, he said. If Dr. Holmes found himself even half a pound below eleven stone six, he asked his wife for another plate of porridge at breakfast. (Rezia would learn to cook porridge.) But, he continued, health is largely a matter in our own control. Throw yourself into outside interests; take up some hobby. He opened Shakespeare -- Antony and Cleopatra; pushed Shakespeare aside. Some hobby, said Dr. Holmes, for did he not owe his own excellent health (and he worked as hard as any man in London) to the fact that he could always switch off from his patients on to old furniture? And what a very pretty comb, if he might say so, Mrs. Warren Smith was wearing!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="霍姆斯大夫又来了。他身材高大，脸色红润，英俊潇洒。他掸掸靴子，照照镜子，把这些症状全不当回事——头痛、失眠、恐惧、多梦——不过是神经过敏罢了，别无其他，他说。如果霍姆斯大夫发现自己的体重低于一百六十磅，哪怕只轻了半磅，他就会在早餐时要求他妻子给他多来一份麦片粥（蕾西娅需要学会煮麦片粥）。不过，他接着说，健康主要是取决于自己的。要对外界事物培养起广泛的兴趣，要有些兴趣爱好。他打开莎士比亚的书——《安东尼和克利奥佩特拉》，随后又把它丢到一边。得有些兴趣爱好，霍姆斯大夫说，他自己是怎么获得如此良好的健康的呢（要知道，他工作起来的劲头不会输给任何一个伦敦男人），不正是因为他总是能够将注意力从病人身上转移到古董式家具上吗？如果不介意他这么冒昧地说一句，沃伦·史密斯太太头上的那把梳子可真美啊！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So there was no excuse; nothing whatever the matter, except the sin for which human nature had condemned him to death; that he did not feel. He had not cared when Evans was killed; that was worst; but all the other crimes raised their heads and shook their fingers and jeered and sneered over the rail of the bed in the early hours of the morning at the prostrate body which lay realising its degradation; how he had married his wife without loving her; had lied to her; seduced her; outraged Miss Isabel Pole, and was so pocked and marked with vice that women shuddered when they saw him in the street. The verdict of human nature on such a wretch was death.</div>

<div class="line_en">So he was deserted. The whole world was clamouring: Kill yourself, kill yourself, for our sakes. But why should he kill himself for their sakes? Food was pleasant; the sun hot; and this killing oneself, how does one set about it, with a table knife, uglily, with floods of blood,-- by sucking a gaspipe? He was too weak; he could scarcely raise his hand. Besides, now that he was quite alone, condemned, deserted, as those who are about to die are alone, there was a luxury in it, an isolation full of sublimity; a freedom which the attached can never know. Holmes had won of course; the brute with the red nostrils had won.

For often Sir William would travel sixty miles or more down into the country to visit the rich, the afflicted, who could afford the very large fee which Sir William very properly charged for his advice. Her ladyship waited with the rugs about her knees an hour or more, leaning back, thinking sometimes of the patient, sometimes, excusably, of the wall of gold, mounting minute by minute while she waited; the wall of gold that was mounting between them and all shifts and anxieties (she had borne them bravely; they had had their struggles) until she felt wedged on a calm ocean, where only spice winds blow; respected, admired, envied, with scarcely anything left to wish for, though she regretted her stoutness; large dinner-parties every Thursday night to the profession; an occasional bazaar to be opened; Royalty greeted; too little time, alas, with her husband, whose work grew and grew; a boy doing well at Eton; she would have liked a daughter too; interests she had, however, in plenty; child welfare; the after-care of the epileptic, and photography, so that if there was a church building, or a church decaying, she bribed the sexton, got the key and took photographs, which were scarcely to be distinguished from the work of professionals, while she waited.</div>

<div class="line_en">But Proportion has a sister, less smiling, more formidable, a Goddess even now engaged -- in the heat and sands of India, the mud and swamp of Africa, the purlieus of London, wherever in short the climate or the devil tempts men to fall from the true belief which is her own -- is even now engaged in dashing down shrines, smashing idols, and setting up in their place her own stern countenance. Conversion is her name and she feasts on the wills of the weakly, loving to impress, to impose, adoring her own features stamped on the face of the populace. At Hyde Park Corner on a tub she stands preaching; shrouds herself in white and walks penitentially disguised as brotherly love through factories and parliaments; offers help, but desires power; smites out of her way roughly the dissentient, or dissatisfied; bestows her blessing on those who, looking upward, catch submissively from her eyes the light of their own. This lady too (Rezia Warren Smith divined it) had her dwelling in Sir William's heart, though concealed, as she mostly is, under some plausible disguise; some venerable name; love, duty, self sacrifice. How he would work -- how toil to raise funds, propagate reforms, initiate institutions! But conversion, fastidious Goddess, loves blood better than brick, and feasts most subtly on the human will. For example, Lady Bradshaw. Fifteen years ago she had gone under. It was nothing you could put your finger on; there had been no scene, no snap; only the slow sinking, water-logged, of her will into his. Sweet was her smile, swift her submission; dinner in Harley Street, numbering eight or nine courses, feeding ten or fifteen guests of the professional classes, was smooth and urbane. Only as the evening wore on a very slight dulness, or uneasiness perhaps, a nervous twitch, fumble, stumble and confusion indicated, what it was really painful to believe -- that the poor lady lied. Once, long ago, she had caught salmon freely: now, quick to minister to the craving which lit her husband's eye so oilily for dominion, for power, she cramped, squeezed, pared, pruned, drew back, peeped through; so that without knowing precisely what made the evening disagreeable, and caused this pressure on the top of the head (which might well be imputed to the professional conversation, or the fatigue of a great doctor whose life, Lady Bradshaw said, "is not his own but his patients'") disagreeable it was: so that guests, when the clock struck ten, breathed in the air of Harley Street even with rapture; which relief, however, was denied to his patients.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但平衡感有个姐妹，很少微笑，更加严厉，是个女神，即使现在也依旧致力于——在印度的炎热与黄沙中，在非洲的泥泞与沼泽中，在伦敦的贫民窟中，总之，只要是恶劣的气候和狡猾的魔鬼会引诱人们去背离真正信仰的地方，也就是她的真正信仰——冲破神殿，打碎偶像，并以她自己的严厉外表来取而代之。皈依就是她的名字，她凌驾在弱者的意志之上，她喜欢惹人注目、强加于人，欣赏刻在大众脸上的她自己的面容。在海德公园一角，她站在一只木桶上面讲道；裹着白衣，伪装成一个宣扬手足之情的人，如做着忏悔般地在工厂和国会里活动；提供帮助，但也觊觎权力；粗暴地打击那些持不同意见者、心怀不满者；把她的祝福送给那些抬头仰望着她的人，这些驯顺的人在她的眼睛里找到了光明。这位女神（蕾西娅·沃伦·史密斯猜出来了）在威廉爵士的心中也占有一个位置，尽管是隐秘的，在大部分的时间里，都在一种似是而非的伪装之下，以某种脆弱的名义：爱、职责、自我牺牲。他该怎么办呢——筹措资金、宣传改革、创办医院，这些都是多么累人的活呀！但是皈依，这个吹毛求疵的女神，比起砖瓦来，她更爱鲜血，而且以最微妙的方式享受着人类的意志。比如，布莱德肖夫人。十五年前她就已经屈服了。你根本找不出任何理由：没有吵闹，也没有呵斥，只有缓慢地下沉，沉入水中，直到她的意志转变为他的。她的微笑很甜美，她的屈服很迅速。哈利街的晚餐，有八九道菜，要招待十到十五个专业人士，总是办得从容不迫、礼数周全。只是在那天晚上，一丁点细微的疲倦，也或者是不安，紧张的抽搐、哆嗦、困惑、支支吾吾，表示出——要相信这一点实在是痛苦——这位可怜的女士在说谎。很久以前，她曾有过自由自在地钓鲑鱼的经历，而现在，为了及时满足她丈夫对支配和权力的狂热追求，这种欲望会使他的眼睛油光发亮，她麻木，挤退、修理、消灭了自我，退缩在后，偷偷张望。因此她弄不明白是什么造成了那天晚上的不愉快，还弄得大家都头昏脑涨的（很可能是因为那些专业性太强的话题，也或者是要做一个了不起的医生所导致的疲惫，因为他的生活，照布莱德肖夫人的说法，“是属于他的病人的，而不是他自己的”）。所以，当十点钟的钟声敲响，客人们终于可以呼吸到哈利大街上的新鲜空气时，真感到如释重负。然而，这种安慰，他的病人们是无福消受的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There in the grey room, with the pictures on the wall, and the valuable furniture, under the ground glass skylight, they learnt the extent of their transgressions; huddled up in arm-chairs, they watched him go through, for their benefit, a curious exercise with the arms, which he shot out, brought sharply back to his hip, to prove (if the patient was obstinate) that Sir William was master of his own actions, which the patient was not. There some weakly broke down; sobbed, submitted; others, inspired by Heaven knows what intemperate madness, called Sir William to his face a damnable humbug; questioned, even more impiously, life itself. Why live? they demanded. Sir William replied that life was good. Certainly Lady Bradshaw in ostrich feathers hung over the mantelpiece, and as for his income it was quite twelve thousand a year. But to us, they protested, life has given no such bounty. He acquiesced. They lacked a sense of proportion. And perhaps, after all, there is no God? He shrugged his shoulders. In short, this living or not living is an affair of our own? But there they were mistaken. Sir William had a friend in Surrey where they taught, what Sir William frankly admitted was a difficult art -- a sense of proportion. There were, moreover, family affection; honour; courage; and a brilliant career. All of these had in Sir William a resolute champion. If they failed him, he had to support police and the good of society, which, he remarked very quietly, would take care, down in Surrey, that these unsocial impulses, bred more than anything by the lack of good blood, were held in control. And then stole out from her hiding-place and mounted her throne that Goddess whose lust is to override opposition, to stamp indelibly in the sanctuaries of others the image of herself. Naked, defenceless, the exhausted, the friendless received the impress of Sir William's will. He swooped; he devoured. He shut people up. It was this combination of decision and humanity that endeared Sir William so greatly to the relations of his victims.</div>

So he ruminated. It was his habit. He did not go deeply. He brushed surfaces; the dead languages, the living, life in Constantinople, Paris, Rome; riding, shooting, tennis, it had been once. The malicious asserted that he now kept guard at Buckingham Palace, dressed in silk stockings and knee- breeches, over what nobody knew. But he did it extremely efficiently. He had been afloat on the cream of English society for fifty-five years. He had known Prime Ministers. His affections were understood to be deep. And if it were true that he had not taken part in any of the great movements of the time or held important office, one or two humble reforms stood to his credit; an improvement in public shelters was one; the protection of owls in Norfolk another; servant girls had reason to be grateful to him; and his name at the end of letters to the Times, asking for funds, appealing to the public to protect, to preserve, to clear up litter, to abate smoke, and stamp out immorality in parks, commanded respect.</div>

<div class="line_en">Lady Bruton raised the carnations, holding them rather stiffly with much the same attitude with which the General held the scroll in the picture behind her; she remained fixed, tranced. Which was she now, the General's great-grand-daughter? great-great-grand- daughter? Richard Dalloway asked himself. Sir Roderick, Sir Miles, Sir Talbot -- that was it. It was remarkable how in that family the likeness persisted in the women. She should have been a general of dragoons herself. And Richard would have served under her, cheerfully; he had the greatest respect for her; he cherished these romantic views about well-set-up old women of pedigree, and would have liked, in his good-humoured way, to bring some young hot-heads of his acquaintance to lunch with her; as if a type like hers could be bred of amiable tea-drinking enthusiasts! He knew her country. He knew her people. There was a vine, still bearing, which either Lovelace or Herrick -- she never read a word poetry of herself, but so the story ran -- had sat under. Better wait to put before them the question that bothered her (about making an appeal to the public; if so, in what terms and so on), better wait until they have had their coffee, Lady Bruton thought; and so laid the carnations down beside her plate.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“克拉丽莎好吗？”她突兀地问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Clarissa always said that Lady Bruton did not like her. Indeed, Lady Bruton had the reputation of being more interested in politics than people; of talking like a man; of having had a finger in some notorious intrigue of the eighties, which was now beginning to be mentioned in memoirs. Certainly there was an alcove in her drawing-room, and a table in that alcove, and a photograph upon that table of General Sir Talbot Moore, now deceased, who had written there (one evening in the eighties) in Lady Bruton's presence, with her cognisance, perhaps advice, a telegram ordering the British troops to advance upon an historical occasion. (She kept the pen and told the story.) Thus, when she said in her offhand way "How's Clarissa?" husbands had difficulty in persuading their wives and indeed, however devoted, were secretly doubtful themselves, of her interest in women who often got in their husbands' way, prevented them from accepting posts abroad, and had to be taken to the seaside in the middle of the session to recover from influenza. Nevertheless her inquiry, "How's Clarissa?" was known by women infallibly, to be a signal from a well-wisher, from an almost silent companion, whose utterances (half a dozen perhaps in the course of a lifetime) signified recognition of some feminine comradeship which went beneath masculine lunch parties and united Lady Bruton and Mrs. Dalloway, who seldom met, and appeared when they did meet indifferent and even hostile, in a singular bond.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克拉丽莎总是说布鲁顿女士不喜欢她。确实，大家都知道布鲁顿女士对政治比对人更感兴趣。她说话像个男子汉，曾在80年代的一桩臭名昭著的阴谋中插了一手，这件事至今在一些回忆录里还常有提及。她的客厅里肯定有个暗室，里面还有张桌子，上面放着一张将军塔尔博特·摩尔爵士的照片，将军如今已过世，他曾在那里当着布鲁顿女士的面起草了一份电报（在80年代的某个夜晚），电报的内容她是知晓的，也许还帮他出了点主意，那份电报是命令英国部队在某个历史性的时刻进军的（她保存了那支笔，并公开了那件事）。因此，在她唐突地问了一句“克拉丽莎好吗”之时，男人们很难使他们的妻子相信她会对女人感兴趣，毕竟，无论他们对布鲁顿女士多么忠心耿耿，他们自己都在偷偷地怀疑呢。女人们常常坏了丈夫的好事，不许他们去海外就职，议会开到一半却不得不带她们去海滨疗养，因为她们突然患上了流感。然而，女人们还是能够准确地把握住她那句“克拉丽莎好吗”的意义，它是来自一个祝福者、一个几乎沉默寡言的伴侣的信号，她所说的（一辈子里也许有那么五六次）代表她尊重那种女性间的友谊，它是款待男性的午餐会上的一股潜流，它把布鲁顿女士和达洛维夫人以奇特的方式联系在了一起，虽说这两人很少见面，而且见面时总显得冷冰冰的，有时甚至还表现出敌意。">查看中文翻译</div>

She exaggerated. She had perhaps lost her sense of proportion. Emigration was not to others the obvious remedy, the sublime conception. It was not to them (not to Hugh, or Richard, or even to devoted Miss Brush) the liberator of the pent egotism, which a strong martial woman, well nourished, well descended, of direct impulses, downright feelings, and little introspective power (broad and simple -- why could not every one be broad and simple? she asked) feels rise within her, once youth is past, and must eject upon some object -- it may be Emigration, it may be Emancipation; but whatever it be, this object round which the essence of her soul is daily secreted, becomes inevitably prismatic, lustrous, half looking-glass, half precious stone; now carefully hidden in case people should sneer at it; now proudly displayed. Emigration had become, in short, largely Lady Bruton.</div>

Hugh proposed modifications in deference to people's feelings, which, he said rather tartly when Richard laughed, "had to be considered," and read out "how, therefore, we are of opinion that the times are ripe… the superfluous youth of our ever-increasing population… what we owe to the dead…" which Richard thought all stuffing and bunkum, but no harm in it, of course, and Hugh went on drafting sentiments in alphabetical order of the highest nobility, brushing the cigar ash from his waistcoat, and summing up now and then the progress they had made until, finally, he read out the draft of a letter which Lady Bruton felt certain was a masterpiece. Could her own meaning sound like that?</div>

She had lived in the forefront of her time. She had had good friends; known the ablest men of her day. Murmuring London flowed up to her, and her hand, lying on the sofa back, curled upon some imaginary baton such as her grandfathers might have held, holding which she seemed, drowsy and heavy, to be commanding battalions marching to Canada, and those good fellows walking across London, that territory of theirs, that little bit of carpet, Mayfair.</div>

Contrary winds buffeted at the street corner. They looked in at a shop window; they did not wish to buy or to talk but to part, only with contrary winds buffeting the street corner, with some sort of lapse in the tides of the body, two forces meeting in a swirl, morning and afternoon, they paused. Some newspaper placard went up in the air, gallantly, like a kite at first, then paused, swooped, fluttered; and a lady's veil hung. Yellow awnings trembled. The speed of the morning traffic slackened, and single carts rattled carelessly down half- empty streets. In Norfolk, of which Richard Dalloway was half thinking, a soft warm wind blew back the petals; confused the waters; ruffled the flowering grasses. Haymakers, who had pitched beneath hedges to sleep away the morning toil, parted curtains of green blades; moved trembling globes of cow parsley to see the sky; the blue, the steadfast, the blazing summer sky.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I should like to see Mr. Dubonnet," said Hugh in his curt worldly way. It appeared that this Dubonnet had the measurements of Mrs. Whitbread's neck, or, more strangely still, knew her views upon Spanish jewellery and the extent of her possessions in that line (which Hugh could not remember). All of which seemed to Richard Dalloway awfully odd. For he never gave Clarissa presents, except a bracelet two or three years ago, which had not been a success. She never wore it. It pained him to remember that she never wore it. And as a single spider's thread after wavering here and there attaches itself to the point of a leaf, so Richard's mind, recovering from its lethargy, set now on his wife, Clarissa, whom Peter Walsh had loved so passionately; and Richard had had a sudden vision of her there at luncheon; of himself and Clarissa; of their life together; and he drew the tray of old jewels towards him, and taking up first this brooch then that ring, "How much is that?" he asked, but doubted his own taste. He wanted to open the drawing- room door and come in holding out something; a present for Clarissa. Only what? But Hugh was on his legs again. He was unspeakably pompous. Really, after dealing here for thirty-five years he was not going to be put off by a mere boy who did not know his business. For Dubonnet, it seemed, was out, and Hugh would not buy anything until Mr. Dubonnet chose to be in; at which the youth flushed and bowed his correct little bow. It was all perfectly correct. And yet Richard couldn't have said that to save his life! Why these people stood that damned insolence he could not conceive. Hugh was becoming an intolerable ass. Richard Dalloway could not stand more than an hour of his society. And, flicking his bowler hat by way of farewell, Richard turned at the corner of Conduit Street eager, yes, very eager, to travel that spider's thread of attachment between himself and Clarissa; he would go straight to her, in Westminster.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我想见见杜博内先生。”休用老于世故的口吻简洁地说道。看来这个杜博内先生知道惠特布莱德太太的颈围尺寸，或者，虽说这看来愈发奇怪，还知道她喜爱西班牙首饰以及她拥有多少那种首饰（关于这个，休记不清了）。所有这一切在理查德·达洛维看来都十分奇怪。因为他从来不送克拉丽莎礼物，除了两三年前曾送给她一只手镯，而且还失败了。她从来不戴那玩意儿。一想到她从来也不戴，他就觉得心里难受。如一根蜘蛛丝在这儿那儿摇来荡去，之后又依附在了一片叶尖上，理查德的心思也从死气沉沉之中恢复了过来，把全副心思都集中在了他妻子克拉丽莎的身上，彼德·沃尔什曾如此热烈地爱过她呢。理查德骤然在眼前看见了她在午餐会上的情景：他自己和克拉丽莎在一起，他们生活在一起。于是，他把一盘旧首饰拿到自己面前，先拿起一枚胸针，再拿起一枚戒指看了下，“这个多少钱？”他问，但对自己的眼光表示怀疑。他想要打开客厅的门，手里拿着什么东西走进去——献给克拉丽莎的一份礼物。只是送什么好呢？可休又在那里走动了。他真是虚荣心强得没话说了。真的，他已和这家店打了三十五年的交道，才不会被一个对生意经一窍不通的毛孩子忽悠呢。杜博内先生好像是出去了，如果杜博内先生不在，休就不会买任何东西，那小伙子听到这句，脸刷地就红了，赶忙毕恭毕敬地朝他鞠了小小的一躬。一切都很完美，礼貌周到。然而即使要了理查德的命，他也不会那么说的！他想不通这些店员怎么能忍受这个该死的傲慢之徒。休成了个令人受不了的混蛋。理查德·达洛维和他在一起超过一小时就会受不了的。于是，理查德轻轻弹了下圆顶礼帽表示再见，转过了康迪特街的街角，急切地，是的，非常急切地，去追随那根将他和克拉丽莎联系在一起的蛛丝。他要径直奔向威斯敏斯特，奔到她的身旁。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But he wanted to come in holding something. Flowers? Yes, flowers, since he did not trust his taste in gold; any number of flowers, roses, orchids, to celebrate what was, reckoning things as you will, an event; this feeling about her when they spoke of Peter Walsh at luncheon; and they never spoke of it; not for years had they spoken of it; which, he thought, grasping his red and white roses together (a vast bunch in tissue paper), is the greatest mistake in the world. The time comes when it can't be said; one's too shy to say it, he thought, pocketing his sixpence or two of change, setting off with his great bunch held against his body to Westminster to say straight out in so many words (whatever she might think of him), holding out his flowers, "I love you." Why not? Really it was a miracle thinking of the war, and thousands of poor chaps, with all their lives before them, shovelled together, already half forgotten; it was a miracle. Here he was walking across London to say to Clarissa in so many words that he loved her. Which one never does say, he thought. Partly one's lazy; partly one's shy. And Clarissa -- it was difficult to think of her; except in starts, as at luncheon, when he saw her quite distinctly; their whole life. He stopped at the crossing; and repeated -- being simple by nature, and undebauched, because he had tramped, and shot; being pertinacious and dogged, having championed the down- trodden and followed his instincts in the House of Commons; being preserved in his simplicity yet at the same time grown rather speechless, rather stiff -- he repeated that it was a miracle that he should have married Clarissa; a miracle -- his life had been a miracle, he thought; hesitating to cross. But it did make his blood boil to see little creatures of five or six crossing Piccadilly alone. The police ought to have stopped the traffic at once. He had no illusions about the London police. Indeed, he was collecting evidence of their malpractices; and those costermongers, not allowed to stand their barrows in the streets; and prostitutes, good Lord, the fault wasn't in them, nor in young men either, but in our detestable social system and so forth; all of which he considered, could be seen considering, grey, dogged, dapper, clean, as he walked across the Park to tell his wife that he loved her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是，他想拿点什么进门。鲜花？对，鲜花，因为他不相信自己对首饰的品位。不论多少束花，玫瑰、兰花都可以的，来庆祝你认为值得庆祝的任何事。他们在午餐会上说起彼德·沃尔什时，他突然对她涌起了一股柔情。他们已经有多年不说感情的事了，他心想，这是世界上最严重的错误，手里捧着红白相间的玫瑰（用薄纱纸包裹着的一大把）。相处久了，这种事就没法说了，因为我们太害羞了，这种话说不出口呀，他想着，把一两个六便士的找头放进口袋，一大捧花紧紧贴在胸口，奔向威斯敏斯特，去直截了当对她说出心里话（不管她会怎么想），献上鲜花，还有说，“我爱你。”有什么不可以呢？想想战争，真是一个奇迹，成千上万个可怜的家伙，生活才刚刚开始，就一同被黄土掩埋了，而且大多已经淡出了人们的记忆。此时，他正在穿越伦敦城，去对克拉丽莎倾诉衷肠，去对她说他爱她。我们从来不会这么说的，他想。部分因为懒惰，部分因为羞涩。而克拉丽莎——要想起她来很不容易，除非在一些特别的场合，比如在午餐会上，他才会非常清晰地想起她来，想起他们的生活。他停在十字路口，反复说着——他生性天真，灵魂还没有被腐蚀，因为他奋斗过，坚持过；他执着坚定，支持弱势群体，在下议院会议中直陈己见；他保持了单纯的天性，但同时也变得沉默寡言、拘谨呆板——他反复说着，他能够娶到克拉丽莎，简直就是奇迹。一个奇迹——他的生活就是个奇迹，他沉思着，在十字路口踌躇不前。不过看着那些只有五六岁的小家伙独自穿过皮卡迪里街，他觉得火冒三丈。交警应该立刻把来往的车流拦下来。他对伦敦的交警不抱幻想。实际上，他是在收集警察渎职的证据，例如不许小摊贩把货车停在大街上，不许妓女拉客，天哪，错不在她们身上，也不在那些寻快活的小青年身上，而在我们这个面目可憎的社会制度，诸如此类。这些都是他脑子里考虑着的问题，你可以看出他在深思，你看他头发灰白，犟头倔脑，衣冠楚楚，干净整齐地穿过公园回家去，去告诉妻子他爱她。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For he would say it in so many words, when he came into the room. Because it is a thousand pities never to say what one feels, he thought, crossing the Green Park and observing with pleasure how in the shade of the trees whole families, poor families, were sprawling; children kicking up their legs; sucking milk; paper bags thrown about, which could easily be picked up (if people objected) by one of those fat gentlemen in livery; for he was of opinion that every park, and every square, during the summer months should be open to children (the grass of the park flushed and faded, lighting up the poor mothers of Westminster and their crawling babies, as if a yellow lamp were moved beneath). But what could be done for female vagrants like that poor creature, stretched on her elbow (as if she had flung herself on the earth, rid of all ties, to observe curiously, to speculate boldly, to consider the whys and the wherefores, impudent, loose-lipped, humorous), he did not know. Bearing his flowers like a weapon, Richard Dalloway approached her; intent he passed her; still there was time for a spark between them -- she laughed at the sight of him, he smiled good-humouredly, considering the problem of the female vagrant; not that they would ever speak.

<div class="line_en">How like him! He would go on saying "An hour's complete rest after luncheon" to the end of time, because a doctor had ordered it once. It was like him to take what doctors said literally; part of his adorable, divine simplicity, which no one had to the same extent; which made him go and do the thing while she and Peter frittered their time away bickering. He was already halfway to the House of Commons, to his Armenians, his Albanians, having settled her on the sofa, looking at his roses. And people would say, "Clarissa Dalloway is spoilt." She cared much more for her roses than for the Armenians. Hunted out of existence, maimed, frozen, the victims of cruelty and injustice (she had heard Richard say so over and over again)-- no, she could feel nothing for the Albanians, or was it the Armenians? but she loved her roses (didn't that help the Armenians?)-- the only flowers she could bear to see cut. But Richard was already at the House of Commons; at his Committee, having settled all her difficulties. But no; alas, that was not true. He did not see the reasons against asking Ellie Henderson. She would do it, of course, as he wished it. Since he had brought the pillows, she would lie down… But -- but -- why did she suddenly feel, for no reason that she could discover, desperately unhappy? As a person who has dropped some grain of pearl or diamond into the grass and parts the tall blades very carefully, this way and that, and searches here and there vainly, and at last spies it there at the roots, so she went through one thing and another; no, it was not Sally Seton saying that Richard would never be in the Cabinet because he had a second-class brain (it came back to her); no, she did not mind that; nor was it to do with Elizabeth either and Doris Kilman; those were facts. It was a feeling, some unpleasant feeling, earlier in the day perhaps; something that Peter had said, combined with some depression of her own, in her bedroom, taking off her hat; and what Richard had said had added to it, but what had he said? There were his roses. Her parties! That was it! Her parties! Both of them criticised her very unfairly, laughed at her very unjustly, for her parties. That was it! That was it!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="太有他的特色了！他会一再说“午餐会之后该好好地休息一小时”，直到世界末日，因为有个大夫曾对他这么说过。他这种人对医生说的话会不折不扣地执行，部分是因为他那可爱的、非凡的单纯，没有人能单纯到他那样的程度，这使得他去完成了他的那些事业，而她和彼德则把时间都浪费在了喋喋不休的争论中。理查德已经在去下议院的半路上了，要去讨论他的亚美尼亚人，或者是阿尔巴尼亚人，留下她坐在沙发上，看着他献上的玫瑰。而别人会说“克拉丽莎·达洛维被宠坏了”。比起亚美尼亚人来，她更关心她的玫瑰。尽管那些人到哪儿都被人驱逐，受尽了折磨，饥寒交迫，成为了残忍与不公的牺牲品（她不知道听理查德说过多少遍了）——然而，她对阿尔巴尼亚人什么感觉也没有，或者是亚美尼亚人吧？可她爱她的玫瑰（这难道对亚美尼亚人没有一点帮助吗？）——这是她能容忍看着别人把它从枝头摘下来的唯一一种花。可理查德大概已经到了下议院，在委员会里，已经解决了她所有的困难。可是不，唉，这不是真的。他不明白她不想请埃莉·亨德森的原因。她当然会照他希望的那样做。因为他已经拿来了枕头，她就躺下来吧…可是——可是——为什么她会突然间感觉，她实在找不出任何理由，会有如此刻骨铭心的痛苦？像一个在草地里丢失了一粒珍珠或钻石的人，如此这般小心翼翼地拨开高高的草丛，这里那里徒劳地寻找着，最后在草根处发现了它，她就这么将事情一桩桩一件件地梳理了一番。不，不是因为萨利·西顿说了理查德永远也进不了内阁，因为他有颗二流的脑袋（她想起了萨利说过的这句话），不，她对此并不介意；也不是因为伊丽莎白和多丽丝·基尔曼的缘故，那是明显的事实。这是一种感觉，一种不愉快的感觉，也许是因为今天早上，彼德说过的什么话，与她在卧室里脱掉帽子时感到的一丝沮丧交织在一起，而理查德说的话更增加了她的不快，可他说了什么呢？他的玫瑰还在这里。她的派对！就是它！她的派对！他们俩都非常不公地批评了她，非常刻薄地嘲笑她，因为她的派对。就是为了它！就是为了它！">查看中文翻译</div>

Was it that some Mongol had been wrecked on the coast of Norfolk (as Mrs. Hilbery said), had mixed with the Dalloway ladies, perhaps, a hundred years ago? For the Dalloways, in general, were fair-haired; blue-eyed; Elizabeth, on the contrary, was dark; had Chinese eyes in a pale face; an Oriental mystery; was gentle, considerate, still. As a child, she had had a perfect sense of humour; but now at seventeen, why, Clarissa could not in the least understand, she had become very serious; like a hyacinth, sheathed in glossy green, with buds just tinted, a hyacinth which has had no sun.</div>

<div class="line_en">She had been cheated. Yes, the word was no exaggeration, for surely a girl has a right to some kind of happiness? And she had never been happy, what with being so clumsy and so poor. And then, just as she might have had a chance at Miss Dolby's school, the war came; and she had never been able to tell lies. Miss Dolby thought she would be happier with people who shared her views about the Germans. She had had to go. It was true that the family was of German origin; spelt the name Kiehlman in the eighteenth century; but her brother had been killed. They turned her out because she would not pretend that the Germans were all villains -- when she had German friends, when the only happy days of her life had been spent in Germany! And after all, she could read history. She had had to take whatever she could get. Mr. Dalloway had come across her working for the Friends. He had allowed her (and that was really generous of him) to teach his daughter history. Also she did a little Extension lecturing and so on. Then Our Lord had come to her (and here she always bowed her head). She had seen the light two years and three months ago. Now she did not envy women like Clarissa Dalloway; she pitied them.</div>

<div class="line_en">Bitter and burning, Miss Kilman had turned into a church two years three months ago. She had heard the Rev. Edward Whittaker preach; the boys sing; had seen the solemn lights descend, and whether it was the music, or the voices (she herself when alone in the evening found comfort in a violin; but the sound was excruciating; she had no ear), the hot and turbulent feelings which boiled and surged in her had been assuaged as she sat there, and she had wept copiously, and gone to call on Mr. Whittaker at his private house in Kensington. It was the hand of God, he said. The Lord had shown her the way. So now, whenever the hot and painful feelings boiled within her, this hatred of Mrs. Dalloway, this grudge against the world, she thought of God. She thought of Mr. Whittaker. Rage was succeeded by calm. A sweet savour filled her veins, her lips parted, and, standing formidable upon the landing in her mackintosh, she looked with steady and sinister serenity at Mrs. Dalloway, who came out with her daughter.</div>

<div class="line_en">But Miss Kilman did not hate Mrs. Dalloway. Turning her large gooseberry-coloured eyes upon Clarissa, observing her small pink face, her delicate body, her air of freshness and fashion, Miss Kilman felt, Fool! Simpleton! You who have known neither sorrow nor pleasure; who have trifled your life away! And there rose in her an overmastering desire to overcome her; to unmask her. If she could have felled her it would have eased her. But it was not the body; it was the soul and its mockery that she wished to subdue; make feel her mastery. If only she could make her weep; could ruin her; humiliate her; bring her to her knees crying, You are right! But this was God's will, not Miss Kilman's. It was to be a religious victory.

<div class="line_en">Love and religion! thought Clarissa, going back into the drawing- room, tingling all over. How detestable, how detestable they are! For now that the body of Miss Kilman was not before her, it overwhelmed her -- the idea. The cruelest things in the world, she thought, seeing them clumsy, hot, domineering, hypocritical, eavesdropping, jealous, infinitely cruel and unscrupulous, dressed in a mackintosh coat, on the landing; love and religion. Had she ever tried to convert any one herself? Did she not wish everybody merely to be themselves? And she watched out of the window the old lady opposite climbing upstairs. Let her climb upstairs if she wanted to; let her stop; then let her, as Clarissa had often seen her, gain her bedroom, part her curtains, and disappear again into the background. Somehow one respected that -- that old woman looking out of the window, quite unconscious that she was being watched. There was something solemn in it -- but love and religion would destroy that, whatever it was, the privacy of the soul. The odious Kilman would destroy it. Yet it was a sight that made her want to cry.</div>

<div class="line_en">How extraordinary it was, strange, yes, touching, to see the old lady (they had been neighbours ever so many years) move away from the window, as if she were attached to that sound, that string. Gigantic as it was, it had something to do with her. Down, down, into the midst of ordinary things the finger fell making the moment solemn. She was forced, so Clarissa imagined, by that sound, to move, to go -- but where? Clarissa tried to follow her as she turned and disappeared, and could still just see her white cap moving at the back of the bedroom. She was still there moving about at the other end of the room. Why creeds and prayers and mackintoshes? when, thought Clarissa, that's the miracle, that's the mystery; that old lady, she meant, whom she could see going from chest of drawers to dressing-table. She could still see her. And the supreme mystery which Kilman might say she had solved, or Peter might say he had solved, but Clarissa didn't believe either of them had the ghost of an idea of solving, was simply this: here was one room; there another. Did religion solve that, or love?</div>

It was Peter who had helped her; Peter who had lent her books. But look at the women he loved -- vulgar, trivial, commonplace.

Do her hair as she might, her forehead remained like an egg, bald, white. No clothes suited her. She might buy anything. And for a woman, of course, that meant never meeting the opposite sex. Never would she come first with any one. Sometimes lately it had seemed to her that, except for Elizabeth, her food was all that she lived for; her comforts; her dinner, her tea; her hot-water bottle at night.

They lived with everything they wanted,-- her mother had breakfast in bed every day; Lucy carried it up; and she liked old women because they were Duchesses, and being descended from some Lord.

And she talked too about the war. After all, there were people who did not think the English invariably right. There were books. There were meetings. There were other points of view.

Her hands twitched. She seemed to struggle. Yet to others God was accessible and the path to Him smooth. Mr. Fletcher, retired, of the Treasury, Mrs. Gorham, widow of the famous K.

Of course, she would not push her way. She inclined to be passive. It was expression she needed, but her eyes were fine, Chinese, oriental, and, as her mother said, with such nice shoulders and holding herself so straight, she was always charming to look at; and lately, in the evening especially, when she was interested, for she never seemed excited, she looked almost beautiful, very stately, very serene. What could she be thinking? Every man fell in love with her, and she was really awfully bored. For it was beginning. Her mother could see that -- the compliments were beginning. That she did not care more about it -- for instance for her clothes -- sometimes worried Clarissa, but perhaps it was as well with all those puppies and guinea pigs about having distemper, and it gave her a charm.

<div class="line_en">Suddenly Elizabeth stepped forward and most competently boarded the omnibus, in front of everybody. She took a seat on top. The impetuous creature -- a pirate -- started forward, sprang away; she had to hold the rail to steady herself, for a pirate it was, reckless, unscrupulous, bearing down ruthlessly, circumventing dangerously, boldly snatching a passenger, or ignoring a passenger, squeezing eel-like and arrogant in between, and then rushing insolently all sails spread up Whitehall. And did Elizabeth give one thought to poor Miss Kilman who loved her without jealousy, to whom she had been a fawn in the open, a moon in a glade? She was delighted to be free. The fresh air was so delicious. It had been so stuffy in the Army and Navy Stores. And now it was like riding, to be rushing up Whitehall; and to each movement of the omnibus the beautiful body in the fawn-coloured coat responded freely like a rider, like the figure-head of a ship, for the breeze slightly disarrayed her; the heat gave her cheeks the pallor of white painted wood; and her fine eyes, having no eyes to meet, gazed ahead, blank, bright, with the staring incredible innocence of sculpture.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was always talking about her own sufferings that made Miss Kilman so difficult. And was she right? If it was being on committees and giving up hours and hours every day (she hardly ever saw him in London) that helped the poor, her father did that, goodness knows,-- if that was what Miss Kilman meant about being a Christian; but it was so difficult to say.

Animals are often ill. She might own a thousand acres and have people under her. She would go and see them in their cottages. This was Somerset House. One might be a very good farmer -- and that, strangely enough though Miss Kilman had her share in it, was almost entirely due to Somerset House. It looked so splendid, so serious, that great grey building. And she liked the feeling of people working. She liked those churches, like shapes of grey paper, breasting the stream of the Strand. It was quite different here from Westminster, she thought, getting off at Chancery Lane. It was so serious; it was so busy. In short, she would like to have a profession. She would become a doctor, a farmer, possibly go into Parliament, if she found it necessary, all because of the Strand.</div>

Abbesses, principals, head mistresses, dignitaries, in the republic of women -- without being brilliant, any of them, they were that. She penetrated a little further in the direction of St. Paul's. She liked the geniality, sisterhood, motherhood, brotherhood of this uproar. It seemed to her good. The noise was tremendous; and suddenly there were trumpets (the unemployed) blaring, rattling about in the uproar; military music; as if people were marching; yet had they been dying -- had some woman breathed her last and whoever was watching, opening the window of the room where she had just brought off that act of supreme dignity, looked down on Fleet Street, that uproar, that military music would have come triumphing up to him, consolatory, indifferent.</div>

For although the clouds were of mountainous white so that one could fancy hacking hard chips off with a hatchet, with broad golden slopes, lawns of celestial pleasure gardens, on their flanks, and had all the appearance of settled habitations assembled for the conference of gods above the world, there was a perpetual movement among them. Signs were interchanged, when, as if to fulfil some scheme arranged already, now a summit dwindled, now a whole block of pyramidal size which had kept its station inalterably advanced into the midst or gravely led the procession to fresh anchorage. Fixed though they seemed at their posts, at rest in perfect unanimity, nothing could be fresher, freer, more sensitive superficially than the snow-white or gold-kindled surface; to change, to go, to dismantle the solemn assemblage was immediately possible; and in spite of the grave fixity, the accumulated robustness and solidity, now they struck light to the earth, now darkness.</div>

Miracles, revelations, agonies, loneliness, falling through the sea, down, down into the flames, all were burnt out, for he had a sense, as he watched Rezia trimming the straw hat for Mrs. Peters, of a coverlet of flowers.</div>

He had come in, rather shyly, looking round him, and his hat had fallen when he hung it up. That she could remember. She knew he was English, though not one of the large Englishmen her sister admired, for he was always thin; but he had a beautiful fresh colour; and with his big nose, his bright eyes, his way of sitting a little hunched made her think, she had often told him, of a young hawk, that first evening she saw him, when they were playing dominoes, and he had come in -- of a young hawk; but with her he was always very gentle. She had never seen him wild or drunk, only suffering sometimes through this terrible war, but even so, when she came in, he would put it all away. Anything, anything in the whole world, any little bother with her work, anything that struck her to say she would tell him, and he understood at once. Her own family even were not the same. Being older than she was and being so clever -- how serious he was, wanting her to read Shakespeare before she could even read a child's story in English!-- being so much more experienced, he could help her.

<div class="line_en">Holmes was coming upstairs. Holmes would burst open the door. Holmes would say "In a funk, eh?" Holmes would get him. But no; not Holmes; not Bradshaw. Getting up rather unsteadily, hopping indeed from foot to foot, he considered Mrs. Filmer's nice clean bread knife with "Bread" carved on the handle. Ah, but one mustn't spoil that. The gas fire? But it was too late now. Holmes was coming. Razors he might have got, but Rezia, who always did that sort of thing, had packed them. There remained only the window, the large Bloomsbury-lodging house window, the tiresome, the troublesome, and rather melodramatic business of opening the window and throwing himself out. It was their idea of tragedy, not his or Rezia's (for she was with him). Holmes and Bradshaw like that sort of thing. (He sat on the sill.) But he would wait till the very last moment. He did not want to die. Life was good. The sun hot. Only human beings -- what did THEY want? Coming down the staircase opposite an old man stopped and stared at him. Holmes was at the door. "I'll give it you!" he cried, and flung himself vigorously, violently down on to Mrs. Filmer's area railings.</div>

The clock was striking -- one, two, three: how sensible the sound was; compared with all this thumping and whispering; like Septimus himself. She was falling asleep. But the clock went on striking, four, five, six and Mrs. Filmer waving her apron (they wouldn't bring the body in here, would they?) seemed part of that garden; or a flag.

<div class="line_en">One of the triumphs of civilisation, Peter Walsh thought. It is one of the triumphs of civilisation, as the light high bell of the ambulance sounded. Swiftly, cleanly the ambulance sped to the hospital, having picked up instantly, humanely, some poor devil; some one hit on the head, struck down by disease, knocked over perhaps a minute or so ago at one of these crossings, as might happen to oneself. That was civilisation. It struck him coming back from the East -- the efficiency, the organisation, the communal spirit of London. Every cart or carriage of its own accord drew aside to let the ambulance pass. Perhaps it was morbid; or was it not touching rather, the respect which they showed this ambulance with its victim inside -- busy men hurrying home yet instantly bethinking them as it passed of some wife; or presumably how easily it might have been them there, stretched on a shelf with a doctor and a nurse… Ah, but thinking became morbid, sentimental, directly one began conjuring up doctors, dead bodies; a little glow of pleasure, a sort of lust too over the visual impression warned one not to go on with that sort of thing any more -- fatal to art, fatal to friendship. True. And yet, thought Peter Walsh, as the ambulance turned the corner though the light high bell could be heard down the next street and still farther as it crossed the Tottenham Court Road, chiming constantly, it is the privilege of loneliness; in privacy one may do as one chooses. One might weep if no one saw. It had been his undoing -- this susceptibility -- in Anglo-Indian society; not weeping at the right time, or laughing either. I have that in me, he thought standing by the pillar-box, which could now dissolve in tears. Why, Heaven knows. Beauty of some sort probably, and the weight of the day, which beginning with that visit to Clarissa had exhausted him with its heat, its intensity, and the drip, drip, of one impression after another down into that cellar where they stood, deep, dark, and no one would ever know. Partly for that reason, its secrecy, complete and inviolable, he had found life like an unknown garden, full of turns and corners, surprising, yes; really it took one's breath away, these moments; there coming to him by the pillar-box opposite the British Museum one of them, a moment, in which things came together; this ambulance; and life and death. It was as if he were sucked up to some very high roof by that rush of emotion and the rest of him, like a white shell-sprinkled beach, left bare. It had been his undoing in Anglo-Indian society -- this susceptibility.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="文明的一次胜利，彼德·沃尔什想。这是文明的一次胜利，当他听见清脆、尖利的救护车铃声传来时。救护车富有人道精神地迅速载上某个可怜的家伙，迅疾地、利落地向医院飞驰而去：可能是脑袋受伤，也可能是突发疾病，也可能是就在一两分钟前在某个路口被车撞了，这种事也可能发生在自己身上的。这就是文明。从东方回来后，文明给了他很深的印象——伦敦的效率、组织、互助精神。每一辆货车和马车都主动闪到一边，给救护车让路。也许这有点变态，但人们对救护车里的牺牲者所表现出来的尊敬，难道不也令人感动吗——忙碌的人们匆匆往家里赶，但同时也不由地想到会不会是自己的妻子在那车子里面，或者想到他们自己也很有可能变成车子里的那个倒霉蛋，四仰八叉地躺在担架上，医生护士陪在旁边…唉，只要脑子里一出现医生、尸体之类的东西，人们的思绪就会变得多么扭曲，多么伤感啊。由这种视觉刺激出来的快乐的灵光一现，或者说一种欲望，告诫人们从今往后别再去想那些事——对艺术，对友谊，它都是致命的。然而，彼德·沃尔什想，救护车转过街角进入另一条街，尽管依然能听见清脆尖利的铃声，它沿着托特纳姆法院街继续往前，铃声一直闹着，那是孤独的特权，在私下里，一个人会按自己的选择行事。如果没人看见，你也许会流泪。正是他的极度敏感，造成了他在印度的英国人圈子里四处碰壁。他总是不合时宜地哭，或不合时宜地笑。我身上有那毛病，他站在邮筒前想道，此刻就能感动得眼泪汪汪。怎么会这样，真是天晓得。也许是一种美，还有白天的重负，它开始于对克拉丽莎的拜访，炎热与紧张把他折磨得筋疲力尽，各种印象接踵而来，一滴滴地流进了他的内心深处，那里又深又暗，一个永远都没人了解的地方。也许是因为它吧，它既神秘又完整，它不容侵犯，他发现生命是一座神秘的花园，花园里曲径通幽，隐秘的角落星罗棋布，充满了神奇。真的，这样的时刻，可以教人屏住呼吸。他站在大英博物馆对面的邮筒前，感受着这样一个时刻，刹那间，各种事物都聚拢到一起，这辆救护车，生命和死亡。他仿佛被喷薄的激情推上了一个高高的屋顶，而他的那具躯壳，则如一片散布着零星贝壳的洁白海滩，空空如也。这造成了他在印度的英国人圈子里兜不开——他那极度的敏感。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Clarissa once, going on top of an omnibus with him somewhere, Clarissa superficially at least, so easily moved, now in despair, now in the best of spirits, all aquiver in those days and such good company, spotting queer little scenes, names, people from the top of a bus, for they used to explore London and bring back bags full of treasures from the Caledonian market -- Clarissa had a theory in those days -- they had heaps of theories, always theories, as young people have. It was to explain the feeling they had of dissatisfaction; not knowing people; not being known. For how could they know each other? You met every day; then not for six months, or years. It was unsatisfactory, they agreed, how little one knew people. But she said, sitting on the bus going up Shaftesbury Avenue, she felt herself everywhere; not "here, here, here"; and she tapped the back of the seat; but everywhere. She waved her hand, going up Shaftesbury Avenue. She was all that. So that to know her, or any one, one must seek out the people who completed them; even the places. Odd affinities she had with people she had never spoken to, some woman in the street, some man behind a counter -- even trees, or barns. It ended in a transcendental theory which, with her horror of death, allowed her to believe, or say that she believed (for all her scepticism), that since our apparitions, the part of us which appears, are so momentary compared with the other, the unseen part of us, which spreads wide, the unseen might survive, be recovered somehow attached to this person or that, or even haunting certain places after death… perhaps -- perhaps.</div>

<div class="line_en">Looking back over that long friendship of almost thirty years her theory worked to this extent. Brief, broken, often painful as their actual meetings had been what with his absences and interruptions (this morning, for instance, in came Elizabeth, like a long-legged colt, handsome, dumb, just as he was beginning to talk to Clarissa) the effect of them on his life was immeasurable. There was a mystery about it. You were given a sharp, acute, uncomfortable grain -- the actual meeting; horribly painful as often as not; yet in absence, in the most unlikely places, it would flower out, open, shed its scent, let you touch, taste, look about you, get the whole feel of it and understanding, after years of lying lost. Thus she had come to him; on board ship; in the Himalayas; suggested by the oddest things (so Sally Seton, generous, enthusiastic goose! thought of HIM when she saw blue hydrangeas). She had influenced him more than any person he had ever known. And always in this way coming before him without his wishing it, cool, lady-like, critical; or ravishing, romantic, recalling some field or English harvest. He saw her most often in the country, not in London. One scene after another at Bourton…</div>

The young lady handed him some letters. He went upstairs -- he saw her most often at Bourton, in the late summer, when he stayed there for a week, or fortnight even, as people did in those days. First on top of some hill there she would stand, hands clapped to her hair, her cloak blowing out, pointing, crying to them -- she saw the Severn beneath. Or in a wood, making the kettle boil -- very ineffective with her fingers; the smoke curtseying, blowing in their faces; her little pink face showing through; begging water from an old woman in a cottage, who came to the door to watch them go. They walked always; the others drove. She was bored driving, disliked all animals, except that dog. They tramped miles along roads. She would break off to get her bearings, pilot him back across country; and all the time they argued, discussed poetry, discussed people, discussed politics (she was a Radical then); never noticing a thing except when she stopped, cried out at a view or a tree, and made him look with her; and so on again, through stubble fields, she walking ahead, with a flower for her aunt, never tired of walking for all her delicacy; to drop down on Bourton in the dusk. Then, after dinner, old Breitkopf would open the piano and sing without any voice, and they would lie sunk in arm-chairs, trying not to laugh, but always breaking down and laughing, laughing -- laughing at nothing.

<div class="line_en">It was odd; it was true; lots of people felt it. Peter Walsh, who had done just respectably, filled the usual posts adequately, was liked, but thought a little cranky, gave himself airs -- it was odd that HE should have had, especially now that his hair was grey, a contented look; a look of having reserves. It was this that made him attractive to women who liked the sense that he was not altogether manly. There was something unusual about him, or something behind him. It might be that he was bookish -- never came to see you without taking up the book on the table (he was now reading, with his bootlaces trailing on the floor); or that he was a gentleman, which showed itself in the way he knocked the ashes out of his pipe, and in his manners of course to women. For it was very charming and quite ridiculous how easily some girl without a grain of sense could twist him round her finger. But at her own risk. That is to say, though he might be ever so easy, and indeed with his gaiety and good-breeding fascinating to be with, it was only up to a point. She said something -- no, no; he saw through that. He wouldn't stand that -- no, no. Then he could shout and rock and hold his sides together over some joke with men. He was the best judge of cooking in India. He was a man. But not the sort of man one had to respect -- which was a mercy; not like Major Simmons, for instance; not in the least like that, Daisy thought, when, in spite of her two small children, she used to compare them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="多奇怪呀，真的，许多人都这么觉得。彼德·沃尔什，到目前为止所做的事情还算体面，对一般的职务也还能胜任，大家也都喜欢他，不过，大家都认为他有点古怪，喜欢摆谱——奇怪的是他居然会有一种心满意足的表情，尤其是如今他的头发都已灰白，脸上还挂着一副矜持的表情。正是这一点使他在女人眼里很有魅力，她们觉得他并非是十足的大男子主义。他身上，或身后，有什么与众不同之处。也许因为他是个书呆子——他来看你时，从来不会忘记拿起你家桌子上的书看一看（他此时正在阅读，鞋带拖在地板上）；或者因为他是个绅士，那是从他倒烟斗灰的动作里看出来的，当然在他对待女性的态度中也能看出来。这多可爱，又多荒唐呀，没有一点头脑的姑娘都能轻而易举地把他玩弄于股掌之间。不过，这姑娘也有自己的风险。也就是说，尽管他也许向来都很随和，而且确实生性乐观教养良好，跟他在一起令人心旷神怡，但那只是在一定程度上而言。那次，她都说了些什么呀——算了，算了，他看出来了。他受不了那个——算了，算了。随后，他就会和那帮男人为了某个笑话而大喊大叫、摇来晃去、捧腹大笑。他是印度最好的烹饪鉴赏师。他是个男人。但不是那种你一定要尊重他的男人——天可怜见的，比如说，不像西蒙斯少校，一点都不像，戴西想，尽管她有了两个小孩，她还是常常拿他俩做比较。">查看中文翻译</div>

Out came with his pocket-knife a snapshot of Daisy on the verandah; Daisy all in white, with a fox-terrier on her knee; very charming, very dark; the best he had ever seen of her. It did come, after all so naturally; so much more naturally than Clarissa. No fuss. No bother. No finicking and fidgeting. All plain sailing. And the dark, adorably pretty girl on the verandah exclaimed (he could hear her). Of course, of course she would give him everything! she cried (she had no sense of discretion) everything he wanted! she cried, running to meet him, whoever might be looking.

<div class="line_en">Well indeed he had got himself into a mess at his age. And it came over him when he woke in the night pretty forcibly. Suppose they did marry? For him it would be all very well, but what about her? Mrs. Burgess, a good sort and no chatterbox, in whom he had confided, thought this absence of his in England, ostensibly to see lawyers might serve to make Daisy reconsider, think what it meant. It was a question of her position, Mrs. Burgess said; the social barrier; giving up her children. She'd be a widow with a past one of these days, draggling about in the suburbs, or more likely, indiscriminate (you know, she said, what such women get like, with too much paint). But Peter Walsh pooh-poohed all that. He didn't mean to die yet. Anyhow she must settle for herself; judge for herself, he thought, padding about the room in his socks, smoothing out his dress-shirt, for he might go to Clarissa's party, or he might go to one of the Halls, or he might settle in and read an absorbing book written by a man he used to know at Oxford. And if he did retire, that's what he'd do -- write books. He would go to Oxford and poke about in the Bodleian. Vainly the dark, adorably pretty girl ran to the end of the terrace; vainly waved her hand; vainly cried she didn't care a straw what people said. There he was, the man she thought the world of, the perfect gentleman, the fascinating, the distinguished (and his age made not the least difference to her), padding about a room in an hotel in Bloomsbury, shaving, washing, continuing, as he took up cans, put down razors, to poke about in the Bodleian, and get at the truth about one or two little matters that interested him. And he would have a chat with whoever it might be, and so come to disregard more and more precise hours for lunch, and miss engagements, and when Daisy asked him, as she would, for a kiss, a scene, fail to come up to the scratch (though he was genuinely devoted to her)-- in short it might be happier, as Mrs. Burgess said, that she should forget him, or merely remember him as he was in August 1922, like a figure standing at the cross roads at dusk, which grows more and more remote as the dog-cart spins away, carrying her securely fastened to the back seat, though her arms are outstretched, and as she sees the figure dwindle and disappear still she cries out how she would do anything in the world, anything, anything, anything…</div>

And then he could just -- just do what? just haunt and hover (he was at the moment actually engaged in sorting out various keys, papers), swoop and taste, be alone, in short, sufficient to himself; and yet nobody of course was more dependent upon others (he buttoned his waistcoat); it had been his undoing. He could not keep out of smoking-rooms, liked colonels, liked golf, liked bridge, and above all women's society, and the fineness of their companionship, and their faithfulness and audacity and greatness in loving which though it had its drawbacks seemed to him (and the dark, adorably pretty face was on top of the envelopes) so wholly admirable, so splendid a flower to grow on the crest of human life, and yet he could not come up to the scratch, being always apt to see round things (Clarissa had sapped something in him permanently), and to tire very easily of mute devotion and to want variety in love, though it would make him furious if Daisy loved anybody else, furious! for he was jealous, uncontrollably jealous by temperament.

Why he should have spoken so moderately yet firmly, with the air of a disciplinarian well within his rights which are founded upon justice, neither young Charles Morris, nor old Charles, neither Miss Elaine nor Mrs. Morris knew.

Peter Walsh sat there. One might fancy that day, the London day, was just beginning. Like a woman who had slipped off her print dress and white apron to array herself in blue and pearls, the day changed, put off stuff, took gauze, changed to evening, and with the same sigh of exhilaration that a woman breathes, tumbling petticoats on the floor, it too shed dust, heat, colour; the traffic thinned; motor cars, tinkling, darting, succeeded the lumber of vans; and here and there among the thick foliage of the squares an intense light hung. I resign, the evening seemed to say, as it paled and faded above the battlements and prominences, moulded, pointed, of hotel, flat, and block of shops, I fade, she was beginning, I disappear, but London would have none of it, and rushed her bayonets into the sky, pinioned her, constrained her to partnership in her revelry.</div>

<div class="line_en">For the great revolution of Mr. Willett's summer time had taken place since Peter Walsh's last visit to England. The prolonged evening was new to him. It was inspiriting, rather. For as the young people went by with their despatch-boxes, awfully glad to be free, proud too, dumbly, of stepping this famous pavement, joy of a kind, cheap, tinselly, if you like, but all the same rapture, flushed their faces. They dressed well too; pink stockings; pretty shoes. They would now have two hours at the pictures. It sharpened, it refined them, the yellow-blue evening light; and on the leaves in the square shone lurid, livid -- they looked as if dipped in sea water -- the foliage of a submerged city. He was astonished by the beauty; it was encouraging too, for where the returned Anglo-Indian sat by rights (he knew crowds of them) in the Oriental Club biliously summing up the ruin of the world, here was he, as young as ever; envying young people their summer time and the rest of it, and more than suspecting from the words of a girl, from a housemaid's laughter -- intangible things you couldn't lay your hands on -- that shift in the whole pyramidal accumulation which in his youth had seemed immovable. On top of them it had pressed; weighed them down, the women especially, like those flowers Clarissa's Aunt Helena used to press between sheets of grey blotting-paper with Littré's dictionary on top, sitting under the lamp after dinner. She was dead now. He had heard of her, from Clarissa, losing the sight of one eye. It seemed so fitting -- one of nature's masterpieces -- that old Miss Parry should turn to glass. She would die like some bird in a frost gripping her perch. She belonged to a different age, but being so entire, so complete, would always stand up on the horizon, stone-white, eminent, like a lighthouse marking some past stage on this adventurous, long, long voyage, this interminable (he felt for a copper to buy a paper and read about Surrey and Yorkshire -- he had held out that copper millions of times. Surrey was all out once more)-- this interminable life. But cricket was no mere game. Cricket was important. He could never help reading about cricket. He read the scores in the stop press first, then how it was a hot day; then about a murder case. Having done things millions of times enriched them, though it might be said to take the surface off. The past enriched, and experience, and having cared for one or two people, and so having acquired the power which the young lack, of cutting short, doing what one likes, not caring a rap what people say and coming and going without any very great expectations (he left his paper on the table and moved off), which however (and he looked for his hat and coat) was not altogether true of him, not to-night, for here he was starting to go to a party, at his age, with the belief upon him that he was about to have an experience. But what?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="自从彼德·沃尔什上次回英国以来，威利特先生的伟大革命——夏令时，就已经开始了。延长的黄昏对他是桩新鲜事。还相当振奋人心呢。小伙子们拿着公文箱走过去，因获得了自由而欣喜若狂，还傻乎乎地觉得骄傲，为能走在这条著名的人行道上而感到无比快乐，也许是庸俗，是华而不实的虚荣心，如果你想那么说也行，但那欢天喜地的心情，依然在他们的脸上映出了红晕。他们穿得也很考究，淡红的长袜和挺括的皮鞋。他们现在要去电影院消遣两个小时。黄中透蓝的暮色使他们的轮廓分明起来，也使他们显得更为优雅。暮色把广场上的树叶映得一片苍黄青灰——它们看上去仿佛是浸在海水中一般——一座沉没在海底的城市里的树叶。这样的美令他惊骇，也令他鼓舞，因为那些从印度回来的英国人会心安理得地坐在东方俱乐部里（他认识不少这样的人），怒气冲冲地总结着世界的腐败，而他还在这里，还和以前一样年轻。尽管如此，他依然嫉妒年轻人的夏日时光以及别的一切，还从一个姑娘的话语中，从一个女仆的笑声中——这些都是你无法掌握的无形之物——怀疑起在青年时代里觉得不可动摇地堆积起来的那座金字塔型的社会发生了变化。它曾经压在他们的头顶上，把他们压垮，尤其是女性，就像克拉丽莎的海伦娜姑妈的花，她在晚饭后常常坐在台灯下，把它们夹在灰色吸墨纸之间，上面再压上一本利特雷词典。她现在已经过世了。他从克拉丽莎那里听说，她一只眼睛失明了。似乎很合适——简直是大自然的一大杰作——那个老帕里小姐居然会有个玻璃球眼珠。她会像在风雪中紧紧攀住树枝的一只鸟儿那般死去的。她属于另一个世纪，但她是如此完美，如此统一，她永远都会站立在地平线上，如石头一般洁白刚毅，如一座灯塔，在这个充满危险的、无比漫长的旅途上，在这个没有尽头的（他掏出一枚铜板买了份报纸，看一看萨里和约克郡的板球赛——他已经千百万次掏出过铜板了。萨里又一次出局了）——在这个没有尽头的生活中，标志出一段已然逝去的往昔。但板球不仅仅是一种体育运动。板球是很重要的。他总忍不住想看看板球赛的消息。他先看看报纸付印时临时插进去的最新比分，然后再看天气到底有多热，然后再看一桩谋杀案的报道。同一件事做了千百万次会使这事变得意义丰富，尽管也可以说会使之黯然乏味。过去变得丰富，还积累下经验，曾经在乎过那么一两个人，于是具有了年轻人缺乏的力量，化复杂为简单，做自己想做的，不在乎别人的风言风语，凡事不抱太大期望（他把报纸留在桌上跑掉了），不过他也并非完全如此（他去拿自己的帽子和大衣），至少今晚不是，因为他此刻正准备去参加派对，在他这样的年龄，还满怀期待地以为会有什么事情即将发生在自己身上。但会发生什么呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Beauty anyhow. Not the crude beauty of the eye. It was not beauty pure and simple -- Bedford Place leading into Russell Square. It was straightness and emptiness of course; the symmetry of a corridor; but it was also windows lit up, a piano, a gramophone sounding; a sense of pleasure-making hidden, but now and again emerging when, through the uncurtained window, the window left open, one saw parties sitting over tables, young people slowly circling, conversations between men and women, maids idly looking out (a strange comment theirs, when work was done), stockings drying on top ledges, a parrot, a few plants. Absorbing, mysterious, of infinite richness, this life. And in the large square where the cabs shot and swerved so quick, there were loitering couples, dallying, embracing, shrunk up under the shower of a tree; that was moving; so silent, so absorbed, that one passed, discreetly, timidly, as if in the presence of some sacred ceremony to interrupt which would have been impious. That was interesting. And so on into the flare and glare.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="总之，是美感。不是眼睛里生涩的美，也不是简单纯粹的美——从贝德福德街到拉塞尔广场。当然，这一段路笔直而空阔，有对称的走廊，但也有灯火闪耀的窗户，一架钢琴，一架放着音乐的唱机。你会感觉到人们在偷偷地寻欢作乐，但时不时也会显露出来，透过拉开帷幔的窗户，窗门打开着，你可以看见一群人围桌而坐，年轻人在翩翩起舞，男人和女人在交谈，女仆懒散地看着窗外（那是她们表示工作已经完成的奇特方式）。长袜晾在顶层壁架上，一只鹦鹉，几株花草。引人入胜，神秘莫测，无限广阔，是这样的生活。在这个宽阔的广场上，出租车呼啸而过，猛然打弯，情侣们在闲荡，躲在树荫下甜言蜜语、卿卿我我，真是感人，如此静谧，如此专注，人们小心翼翼地、不好意思地从他们身边走过，仿佛在出席某种神圣的仪式，任何打搅都是一种亵渎的行为。这真有意思。他继续前行，走入一个灯火辉煌的世界。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Was everybody dining out, then? Doors were being opened here by a footman to let issue a high-stepping old dame, in buckled shoes, with three purple ostrich feathers in her hair. Doors were being opened for ladies wrapped like mummies in shawls with bright flowers on them, ladies with bare heads. And in respectable quarters with stucco pillars through small front gardens lightly swathed with combs in their hair (having run up to see the children), women came; men waited for them, with their coats blowing open, and the motor started. Everybody was going out. What with these doors being opened, and the descent and the start, it seemed as if the whole of London were embarking in little boats moored to the bank, tossing on the waters, as if the whole place were floating off in carnival. And Whitehall was skated over, silver beaten as it was, skated over by spiders, and there was a sense of midges round the arc lamps; it was so hot that people stood about talking. And here in Westminster was a retired Judge, presumably, sitting four square at his house door dressed all in white. An Anglo-Indian presumably.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那么，大家都出去吃饭了吗？有个男仆打开了这里的一扇门，出来一位走路大刀阔斧的老妇人，穿着搭襻鞋，头发上插着三根紫色的鸵鸟毛。另外几扇门也打开了，出来几位头戴鲜花、身裹披巾如木乃伊般的女士，还有没戴头饰的女士。在有着装饰立柱的高档住宅区里，女人们头上插着梳子（她们刚才跑上楼去看了下小孩）穿过门前稍稍修饰过的小花园而来；男人们在等着她们，微风吹开了他们的轻大衣，汽车已经发动好了。大家都要出门。大门一扇扇打开了，人们走下台阶出发，于是乎整个伦敦都出动了，人们仿佛在登上停泊在岸边的一只只小船，小船随着波浪颠簸，仿佛整个地方都在摇摆着过狂欢节呢。白厅如一张银箔，弧光灯闪过，如覆上了道道蛛丝，似乎有一群蚊子在围着弧光灯飞舞。天气这么热，大家站在那里交谈。而在这里的威斯敏斯特，有一个退休的法官，披一件白袍，端端正正地坐在家门口，也许还是个英印混血儿呢。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The cold stream of visual impressions failed him now as if the eye were a cup that overflowed and let the rest run down its china walls unrecorded. The brain must wake now. The body must contract now, entering the house, the lighted house, where the door stood open, where the motor cars were standing, and bright women descending: the soul must brave itself to endure. He opened the big blade of his pocket-knife.</div>

<div class="line_en">And here a shindy of brawling women, drunken women; here only a policeman and looming houses, high houses, domed houses, churches, parliaments, and the hoot of a steamer on the river, a hollow misty cry. But it was her street, this, Clarissa's; cabs were rushing round the corner, like water round the piers of a bridge, drawn together, it seemed to him because they bore people going to her party, Clarissa's party.</div>
