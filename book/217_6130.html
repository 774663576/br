<div class="line_en">Col. Grangerford was a gentleman, you see. He was a gentleman all over; and so was his family. He was well born, as the saying is, and that's worth as much in a man as it is in a horse, so the Widow Douglas said, and nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracy in our town; and pap he always said it, too, though he warn't no more quality than a mudcat himself. Col. Grangerford was very tall and very slim, and had a darkish-paly complexion, not a sign of red in it anywheres; he was clean shaved every morning all over his thin face, and he had the thinnest kind of lips, and the thinnest kind of nostrils, and a high nose, and heavy eyebrows, and the blackest kind of eyes, sunk so deep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns at you, as you may say. His forehead was high, and his hair was black and straight and hung to his shoulders. His hands was long and thin, and every day of his life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from head to foot made out of linen so white it hurt your eyes to look at it; and on Sundays he wore a blue tail-coat with brass buttons on it. He carried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it. There warn't no frivolishness about him, not a bit, and he warn't ever loud. He was as kind as he could be – you could feel that, you know, and so you had confidence. Sometimes he smiled, and it was good to see; but when he straightened himself up like a liberty-pole, and the lightning begun to flicker out from under his eyebrows, you wanted to climb a tree first, and find out what the matter was afterwards. He didn't ever have to tell anybody to mind their manners – everybody was always goodmannered where he was. Everybody loved to have him around, too; he was sunshine most always – I mean he made it seem like good weather. When he turned into a cloudbank it was awful dark for half a minute, and that was enough; there wouldn't nothing go wrong again for a week.</div>

He grabbed his gun and rode straight to the place where we was hid. But we didn't wait. We started through the woods on a run. The woods warn't thick, so I looked over my shoulder to dodge the bullet, and twice I seen Harney cover Buck with his gun; and then he rode away the way he come – to get his hat, I reckon, but I couldn't see.

They was all a-horseback; he lit off of his horse and got behind a little woodpile, and kep' his horse before him to stop the bullets; but the Grangerfords stayed on their horses and capered around the old man, and peppered away at him, and he peppered away at them. Him and his horse both went home pretty leaky and crippled, but the Grangerfords had to be FETCHED home – and one of 'em was dead, and another died the next day.

<div class="line_en">About an hour after dinner everybody was dozing around, some in their chairs and some in their rooms, and it got to be pretty dull. Buck and a dog was stretched out on the grass in the sun sound asleep. I went up to our room, and judged I would take a nap myself. I found that sweet Miss Sophia standing in her door, which was next to ours, and she took me in her room and shut the door very soft, and asked me if I liked her, and I said I did; and she asked me if I would do something for her and not tell anybody, and I said I would. Then she said she'd forgot her Testament, and left it in the seat at church between two other books, and would I slip out quiet and go there and fetch it to her, and not say nothing to nobody. I said I would. So I slid out and slipped off up the road, and there warn't anybody at the church, except maybe a hog or two, for there warn't any lock on the door, and hogs likes a puncheon floor in summer-time because it's cool. If you notice, most folks don't go to church only when they've got to; but a hog is different.</div>

So I give it a shake, and out drops a little piece of paper with "HALF-PAST TWO" wrote on it with a pencil. I ransacked it, but couldn't find anything else. I couldn't make anything out of that, so I put the paper in the book again, and when I got home and upstairs there was Miss Sophia in her door waiting for me. She pulled me in and shut the door; then she looked in the Testament till she found the paper, and as soon as she read it she looked glad; and before a body could think she grabbed me and give me a squeeze, and said I was the best boy in the world, and not to tell anybody. She was mighty red in the face for a minute, and her eyes lighted up, and it made her powerful pretty. I was a good deal astonished, but when I got my breath I asked her what the paper was about, and she asked me if I had read it, and I said no, and she asked me if I could read writing, and I told her "no, only coarse-hand," and then she said the paper warn't anything but a book-mark to keep her place, and I might go and play now.</div>

<div class="line_en">All of a sudden, bang! bang! bang! goes three or four guns – the men had slipped around through the woods and come in from behind without their horses! The boys jumped for the river – both of them hurt – and as they swum down the current the men run along the bank shooting at them and singing out, "Kill them, kill them!" It made me so sick I most fell out of the tree. I ain't a-going to tell ALL that happened – it would make me sick again if I was to do that. I wished I hadn't ever come ashore that night to see such things. I ain't ever going to get shut of them – lots of times I dream about them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然之间，砰！砰！砰！响起了三四响枪声。那边的人没有骑马，偷偷穿过林子，绕到他们后边，冲了过来。那两个孩子往河里跳——两人都受了伤——他们往下水划，对方在岸上对着他们一边射击，一边大叫，“打死他们，打死他们！”我当时是多么难受啊！几乎从树上栽下来。这种种全部的经过，我也不想叙说了，——要是这样做的话，只会叫我更难受。我但愿，当初那个夜晚，我根本没有爬上岸来，以致亲眼目击这次的惨祸。我的脑子里，将永远赶不掉这种种的一切——有好多回，我在梦里还梦见了这种种的一切啊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I stayed in the tree till it begun to get dark, afraid to come down. Sometimes I heard guns away off in the woods; and twice I seen little gangs of men gallop past the log store with guns; so I reckoned the trouble was still a-going on. I was mighty downhearted; so I made up my mind I wouldn't ever go anear that house again, because I reckoned I was to blame, somehow. I judged that that piece of paper meant that Miss Sophia was to meet Harney somewheres at half-past two and run off; and I judged I ought to told her father about that paper and the curious way she acted, and then maybe he would a locked her up, and this awful mess wouldn't ever happened.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我躲在树上，一直躲到天黑，害怕爬下树来。我间或听到远处林子里有枪声。有两回，我看到有一小伙的人骑着马、带着枪，驰过木材场，因此我估摸着冲突还没有完。我心里万分沉重，因此打定了主意，从此决不再走近那座房子。因为我寻思，这全是我闯的祸啊！我推想，那张纸片是苏菲亚小姐要和哈尼·歇佛逊在晚上两点半钟一起出奔。我寻思起来，我原本应该把这张纸片的事以及她行动的怪异之处告诉她父亲的。这样，他父亲也许会把她关在房间里不许出来。这么一来，这多么可怕的灾祸就根本不会发生。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When I got down out of the tree I crept along down the river bank a piece, and found the two bodies laying in the edge of the water, and tugged at them till I got them ashore; then I covered up their faces, and got away as quick as I could. I cried a little when I was covering up Buck's face, for he was mighty good to me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我一下了树，就沿着河岸下游偷偷走了一段路。我发现河边躺着两具尸体。我把他们一步步拖上岸来，然后盖住了他们的脸。随后我就赶快离开。把勃克的脸盖起来的时候，我不禁哭了一会儿，因为他对我多么好啊。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was just dark now. I never went near the house, but struck through the woods and made for the swamp. Jim warn't on his island, so I tramped off in a hurry for the crick, and crowded through the willows, red-hot to jump aboard and get out of that awful country. The raft was gone! My souls, but I was scared! I couldn't get my breath for most a minute. Then I raised a yell. A voice not twenty-five foot from me says:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时天刚黑。从此以后，我从未走近那座房子。我穿过林子，往泥水塘那边走。杰姆不在他那片小岛上。我急忙往小河浜那边赶，一路拨开了柳树丛，火烧火燎地只想跳上木筏，远离这片可怕的土地——可是木筏不见了！我的天啊！我多么惊慌啊！我几乎有一分钟时间喘不过气来。我使劲吼叫了一声。离我二十五英尺，响起了一个声音：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was Jim's voice – nothing ever sounded so good before. I run along the bank a piece and got aboard, and Jim he grabbed me and hugged me, he was so glad to see me. He says:</div>
