<div class="line_en">I spent much of my childhood listening to the sound of striving. It came in the form of bad music, or at least amateur music, coming up through the floorboards of my bedroom -- the plink plink plink of students sitting downstairs at my great-aunt Robbie's piano, slowly and imperfectly learning their scales. My family lived in the South Shore neighborhood of Chicago, in a tidy brick bungalow that belonged to Robbie and her husband, Terry. My parents rented an apartment on the second floor, while Robbie and Terry lived on the first. Robbie was my mother's aunt and had been generous to her over many years, but to me she was kind of a terror. Prim and serious, she directed the choir at a local church and was also our community's resident piano teacher. She wore sensible heels and kept a pair of reading glasses on a chain around her neck. She had a sly smile but didn't appreciate sarcasm the way my mother did. I'd sometimes hear her chewing out her students for not having practiced enough or chewing out their parents for delivering them late to lessons.</div>

<div class="line_en">The sound of people trying, however, became the soundtrack to our life. There was plinking in the afternoons, plinking in the evenings. Ladies from church sometimes came over to practice hymns, belting their piety through our walls. Under Robbie's rules, kids who took piano lessons were allowed to work on only one song at a time. From my room, I'd listen to them attempting, note by uncertain note, to win her approval, graduating from "Hot Cross Buns" to "Brahms's Lullaby," but only after many tries. The music was never annoying; it was just persistent. It crept up the stairwell that separated our space from Robbie's. It drifted through open windows in summertime, accompanying my thoughts as I played with my Barbies or built little kingdoms made out of blocks. The only respite came when my father got home from an early shift at the city's water treatment plant and put the Cubs game on TV, boosting the volume just enough to blot it all out.</div>

<div class="line_en">None of this really registered with me. I was just a kid, a girl with Barbies and blocks, with two parents and an older brother who slept each night with his head about three feet from mine. My family was my world, the center of everything. My mother taught me how to read early, walking me to the public library, sitting with me as I sounded out words on a page. My father went to work every day dressed in the blue uniform of a city laborer, but at night he showed us what it meant to love jazz and art. As a boy, he'd taken classes at the Art Institute of Chicago, and in high school he'd painted and sculpted. He'd been a competitive swimmer and boxer in school, too, and as an adult was a fan of every televised sport, from professional golf to the NHL. He appreciated seeing strong people excel. When my brother, Craig, got interested in basketball, my father propped coins above the doorframe in our kitchen, encouraging him to leap for them.</div>

<div class="line_en">This was the tail end of the 1960s on the South Side of Chicago. The Cubs weren't bad, but they weren't great, either. I'd sit on my dad's lap in his recliner and listen to him narrate how the Cubs were in the middle of a late-season swoon or why Billy Williams, who lived just around the corner from us on Constance Avenue, had such a sweet swing from the left side of the plate. Outside the ballparks, America was in the midst of a massive and uncertain shift. The Kennedys were dead. Martin Luther King Jr. had been killed standing on a balcony in Memphis, setting off riots across the country, including in Chicago. The 1968 Democratic National Convention turned bloody as police went after Vietnam War protesters with batons and tear gas in Grant Park, about nine miles north of where we lived. White families, meanwhile, were moving out of the city in droves, lured by the suburbs -- the promise of better schools, more space, and probably more whiteness, too.</div>

<div class="line_en">Craig and I are not quite two years apart in age. He's got my father's soft eyes and optimistic spirit, my mother's implacability. The two of us have always been tight, in part thanks to an unwavering and somewhat inexplicable allegiance he seemed to feel for his baby sister right from the start. There's an early family photograph, a black and white of the four of us sitting on a couch, my mother smiling as she holds me on her lap, my father appearing serious and proud with Craig perched on his. We're dressed for church or maybe a wedding. I'm about eight months old, a pudge-faced, no-nonsense bruiser in diapers and an ironed white dress, looking ready to slide out of my mother's clutches, staring down the camera as if I might eat it. Next to me is Craig, gentlemanly in a little bow tie and suit jacket, bearing an earnest expression. He's two years old and already the portrait of brotherly vigilance and responsibility -- his arm extended toward mine, his fingers wrapped protectively around my fat wrist.</div>

On hot summer nights, Craig and I dozed off to the sound of cheers from the adult-league softball games going on at the nearby public park, where by day we climbed on the playground jungle gym and played tag with other kids.</div>

<div class="line_en">At the time the photo was taken, we were living across the hall from my father's parents in Parkway Gardens, an affordable housing project on the South Side made up of modernist apartment buildings. It had been built in the 1950s and was designed as a co-op, meant to ease a post-World War II housing shortage for black working-class families. Later, it would deteriorate under the grind of poverty and gang violence, becoming one of the city's more dangerous places to live. Long before this, though, when I was still a toddler, my parents -- who had met as teenagers and married in their mid-twenties -- accepted an offer to move a few miles south to Robbie and Terry's place in a nicer neighborhood.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拍这张照片时，我们住在帕克维公园社区，和祖父祖母家只隔着一条过道。帕克维公园社区是芝加哥南城的一处经济适用社区，里面都是现代风格的公寓楼房。社区是20世纪50年代落成的合作公寓 [3]，是为缓解第二次世界大战后黑人工人阶层家庭住房短缺问题而设计的。后来，在贫穷和帮派暴力的碾压下，这个社区每况愈下，成为城里最危险的居住地之一。不过，早在那之前，我还在蹒跚学步时，父母就接受邀请，搬到南边几英里外萝比和特里家里住，这里要比之前社区的环境好多了。我的父母十几岁时相识，后来二十几岁时结了婚。【注：[3]合作公寓，美国城市中低收入居民最主要的居住方式。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On Euclid Avenue, we were two households living under one not very big roof. Judging from the layout, the second-floor space had probably been designed as an in-law apartment meant for one or two people, but four of us found a way to fit inside. My parents slept in the lone bedroom, while Craig and I shared a bigger area that I assume was intended to be the living room. Later, as we grew, my grandfather -- Purnell Shields, my mother's father, who was an enthusiastic if not deeply skilled carpenter -- brought over some cheap wooden paneling and built a makeshift partition to divide the room into two semiprivate spaces. He added a plastic accordion door to each space and created a little common play area in front where we could keep our toys and books.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在欧几里得大道上，我们是住在同一个屋檐下的两户人家，空间并不大。从设计来看，二楼应该是老人房，只够一两个人住，但我们一家四口还是设法住了进去。父母用了唯一的卧室，我和克雷格的卧室在一个稍大的区域，我猜这里本该是起居室。后来，我们长大一些，我的外祖父普耐尔·席尔兹，一个热心但技艺不算精湛的木匠，带来一些便宜的木制镶板，做了一个临时隔断，将房间分成了两个半私密的空间。他还给每个空间安了一扇折叠门，这样又隔出了一个小小的公共游戏区，我们可以用来放玩具和书。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I loved my room. It was just big enough for a twin bed and a narrow desk. I kept all my stuffed animals on the bed, painstakingly tucking them around my head each night as a form of ritual comfort. On his side of the wall, Craig lived a sort of mirror existence with his own bed pushed up against the paneling, parallel to mine. The partition between us was so flimsy that we could talk as we lay in bed at night, often tossing a balled sock back and forth through the ten-inch gap between the partition and the ceiling as we did.</div>

<div class="line_en">Aunt Robbie, meanwhile, kept her part of the house like a mausoleum, the furniture swathed in protective plastic that felt cold and sticky on my bare legs when I dared sit on it. Her shelves were loaded with porcelain figurines we weren't allowed to touch. I'd let my hand hover over a set of sweet-faced glass poodles -- a delicate-looking mother and three tiny puppies -- and then pull it back, fearing Robbie's wrath. When lessons weren't happening, the first floor was deadly silent. The television was never on, the radio never played. I'm not even sure the two of them talked much down there. Robbie's husband's full name was William Victor Terry, but for some reason we called him only by his last name. Terry was like a shadow, a distinguished-looking man who wore three-piece suits every day of the week and pretty much never said a word.</div>

<div class="line_en">Robbie and Terry were older. They grew up in a different era, with different concerns. They'd seen things our parents hadn't -- things that Craig and I, in our raucous childishness, couldn't begin to guess. This was some version of what my mother would say if we got too wound up about the grouchiness downstairs. Even if we didn't know the context, we were instructed to remember that context existed. Everyone on earth, they'd tell us, was carrying around an unseen history, and that alone deserved some tolerance. Robbie, I'd learn many years later, had sued Northwestern University for discrimination, having registered for a choral music workshop there in 1943 and been denied a room in the women's dorm. She was instructed to stay instead in a rooming house in town -- a place "for coloreds," she was told. Terry, meanwhile, had once been a Pullman porter on one of the overnight passenger rail lines running in and out of Chicago. It was a respectable if not well-paying profession, made up entirely of black men who kept their uniforms immaculate while also hauling luggage, serving meals, and generally tending to the needs of train passengers, including shining their shoes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="萝比和特里上了年纪。他们成长于另一个时代，拥有不同的思维方式。他们看到过我们的父母也不曾看到的事情，克雷格和我两个毛孩子就更不懂了。有时我们对楼下的坏脾气抱怨过度时，母亲会这么教育我们。虽然我们不了解时代背景，但我们被教导要记住它是存在的。父母告诉我们，地球上的每个人都背负着一段看不见的历史，单凭这一点，宽容就是必要的。许多年之后，我才了解到，姑婆萝比曾经以种族歧视的罪名控告西北大学。1943年，她报名参加了一个合唱音乐研习班，却不被允许住女生宿舍，而被通知去住城里的一个出租房，还被告知那里是“有色人种”的住处。特里曾经是出入芝加哥的夜间客运专线上的一名卧车服务员。那是一份体面但薪水一般的工作，从事这个工作的全都是黑人男性，他们穿着干净整洁的制服，为乘客提供行李托运、送餐以及其他服务，包括擦鞋。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I came to think of upstairs and downstairs as two different universes, ruled over by competing sensibilities. Upstairs, we were noisy and unapologetically so. Craig and I threw balls and chased each other around the apartment. We sprayed Pledge furniture polish on the wood floor of the hallway so we could slide farther and faster in our socks, often crashing into the walls. We held brother-sister boxing matches in the kitchen, using the two sets of gloves my dad had given us for Christmas, along with personalized instructions on how to land a proper jab. At night, as a family, we played board games, told stories and jokes, and cranked Jackson 5 records on the stereo. When it got to be too much for Robbie down below, she'd emphatically flick the light switch in our shared stairwell, which also controlled the lightbulb in our upstairs hallway, off and on, again and again -- her polite-ish way of telling us to pipe down.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那时我把楼上和楼下看成两个不同的天地，由两种不同的氛围主宰。楼上的我们闹哄哄的，并觉得理应如此。克雷格和我在公寓里互相扔球追逐。我们把碧丽珠家具护理喷蜡喷到走廊的木地板上，这样就可以穿着袜子在上面滑得更远更快，经常滑得撞到墙上。我们用两副手套（那是父亲送的圣诞礼物）在厨房里举行兄妹拳击比赛，还有“私人教练”指导我们如何稳准狠地出击。晚上，我们一家人会玩棋类游戏，讲故事或笑话，听杰克逊五兄弟乐队的唱片。如果我们吵到了楼下的萝比，她便果断地走向我们共用的楼梯间的电灯开关，这个开关也控制着我们楼上走廊的灯泡，一开一关，一开一关，这是她在礼貌地提醒我们小点儿声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I was about four when I decided I wanted to learn piano. Craig, who was in the first grade, was already making trips downstairs for weekly lessons on Robbie's upright and returning relatively unscathed. I figured I was ready. I was pretty convinced I already had learned piano, in fact, through straight-up osmosis -- all those hours spent listening to other kids fumbling through their songs. The music was already in my head. I just wanted to go downstairs and demonstrate to my exacting great-aunt what a gifted girl I was, how it would take no effort at all for me to become her star student.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大概四岁时，我决定学习钢琴。克雷格当时读小学一年级，每周到萝比家学弹立式钢琴，回来时基本安然无恙。我想我准备好了。事实上，我确信自己潜移默化中已经学会了弹钢琴，毕竟之前听了那么久其他孩子磕磕绊绊地弹奏曲子。那些音乐已经印在我脑海中了。我迫不及待想下楼向苛刻的姑婆展示我是一个有天赋的女孩，不费吹灰之力就能成为她的明星学生。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Years after his retirement, Terry still lived in a state of numbed formality -- impeccably dressed, remotely servile, never asserting himself in any way, at least that I would see. It was as if he'd surrendered a part of himself as a way of coping. I'd watch him mow our lawn in the high heat of summer in a pair of wing tips, suspenders, and a thin-brimmed fedora, the sleeves of his dress shirt carefully rolled up. He'd indulge himself by having exactly one cigarette a day and exactly one cocktail a month, and even then he wouldn't loosen up the way my father and mother would after having a highball or a Schlitz, which they did a few times a month. Some part of me wanted Terry to talk, to spill whatever secrets he carried. I imagined that he had all sorts of interesting stories about cities he'd visited and how rich people on trains behaved or maybe didn't. But we wouldn't hear any of it. For some reason, he'd never tell.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="退休多年后，特里依然保持着一种麻木的礼节—着装一丝不苟，态度温和谦卑，与世无争，至少在我眼中是这样。好像他为了生存已经放弃了一部分自我，我常看到他在夏天的烈日下割草，脚穿一双布洛克雕花皮鞋，身穿背带裤，头戴一顶卷檐软呢帽，正装衬衣的袖子仔细地挽上去。他每天只抽一根烟，每月只喝一杯鸡尾酒，这是他放松的方式。即便那样的时候，他也不会像我父母在喝了掺有苏打威士忌调酒和喜立滋啤酒后那样放松，他们每个月都要喝上几次。我有点儿希望特里能开口，倾诉他心里藏着的秘密。我想象他有很多关于他曾到过的城市以及富人们在火车上行为是否得体的有趣故事。但是，我们没有听到过任何故事。不知为何，他从来不讲这些。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Robbie's piano sat in a small square room at the rear of the house, close to a window that overlooked the backyard. She kept a potted plant in one corner and a folding table where students could fill out music work sheets in the other. During lessons, she sat straight spined in an upholstered high-back armchair, tapping out the beat with one finger, her head cocked as she listened keenly for each mistake. Was I afraid of Robbie? Not exactly, but there was a scariness to her; she represented a rigid kind of authority I hadn't yet encountered elsewhere. She demanded excellence from every kid who sat on her piano bench. I saw her as someone to win over, or maybe to somehow conquer. With her, it always felt like there was something to prove.</div>

<div class="line_en">It turned out I liked the piano. Sitting at it felt natural, like something I was meant to do. My family was loaded with musicians and music lovers, especially on my mother's side. I had an uncle who played in a professional band. Several of my aunts sang in church choirs. I had Robbie, who in addition to her choir and lessons directed something called the Operetta Workshop, a shoestring musical theater program for kids, which Craig and I attended every Saturday morning in the basement of her church. The musical center of my family, though, was my grandfather Shields, the carpenter, who was also Robbie's younger brother. He was a carefree, round-bellied man with an infectious laugh and a scraggly salt-and-pepper beard. When I was younger, he'd lived on the West Side of the city and Craig and I had referred to him as Westside. But he moved into our neighborhood the same year I started taking piano lessons, and we'd duly rechristened him Southside.</div>

<div class="line_en">When you're little, a piano can look like it has a thousand keys. You're staring at an expanse of black and white that stretches farther than two small arms can reach. Middle C, I soon learned, was the anchoring point. It was the territorial line between where the right hand and the left hand traveled, between the treble and the bass clefs. If you could lay your thumb on middle C, everything else automatically fell into place. The keys on Robbie's piano had a subtle unevenness of color and shape, places where bits of the ivory had broken off over time, leaving them looking like a set of bad teeth. Helpfully, the middle C key had a full corner missing, a wedge about the size of my fingernail, which got me centered every time.</div>

He didn't trust dentists, which led to his having virtually no teeth. He didn't trust the police, and he didn't always trust white people, either, being the grandson of a Georgia slave and having spent his early childhood in Alabama during the time of Jim Crow before coming north to Chicago in the 1920s.

When Southside had a payday for his carpentry work, he'd sometimes splurge and buy himself a new album. He threw regular parties for the family, forcing everyone to talk loudly over whatever he put on the stereo, because the music always dominated. We celebrated most major life events at Southside's house, which meant that over the years we unwrapped Christmas presents to Ella Fitzgerald and blew out birthday candles to Coltrane. According to my mother, as a younger man Southside had made a point of pumping jazz into his seven children, often waking everyone at sunrise by playing one of his records at full blast.</div>

<div class="line_en">At home, I continued to work on my own progress as a musician. Sitting at Robbie's upright piano, I was quick to pick up the scales -- that osmosis thing was real -- and I threw myself into filling out the sight-reading work sheets she gave me. Because we didn't have a piano of our own, I had to do my practicing downstairs on hers, waiting until nobody else was having a lesson, often dragging my mom with me to sit in the upholstered chair and listen to me play. I learned one song in the piano book and then another. I was probably no better than her other students, no less fumbling, but I was driven. To me, there was magic in the learning. I got a buzzy sort of satisfaction from it. For one thing, I'd picked up on the simple, encouraging correlation between how long I practiced and how much I achieved. And I sensed something in Robbie as well -- too deeply buried to be outright pleasure, but still, a pulse of something lighter and happier coming from her when I made it through a song without messing up, when my right hand picked out a melody while my left touched down on a chord. I'd notice it out of the corner of my eye: Robbie's lips would unpurse themselves just slightly; her tapping finger would pick up a little bounce.</div>

It's possible that we might have continued this way, Robbie and I, had I been less curious and more reverent when it came to her piano method. But the lesson book was thick enough and my progress on the opening few songs slow enough that I got impatient and started peeking ahead -- and not just a few pages ahead but deep into the book, checking out the titles of the more advanced songs and beginning, during my practice sessions, to fiddle around with playing them. When I proudly debuted one of my late-in-the-book songs for Robbie, she exploded, slapping down my achievement with a vicious "Good night!" I got chewed out the way I'd heard her chewing out plenty of students before me. All I'd done was try to learn more and faster, but Robbie viewed it as a crime approaching treason.

In general, they weren't ones to intervene in matters outside schooling, expecting early on that my brother and I should handle our own business. They seemed to view their job as mostly to listen and bolster us as needed inside the four walls of our home. And where another parent might have scolded a kid for being sassy with an elder as I had been, they also let that be. My mother had lived with Robbie on and off since she was about sixteen, following every arcane rule the woman laid down, and it's possible she was secretly happy to see Robbie's authority challenged.

To this day, I'm not sure how she managed it, but she somehow got access to a practice hall at Roosevelt University in downtown Chicago, holding her recitals in a grand stone building on Michigan Avenue, right near where the Chicago Symphony Orchestra played. Just thinking about going there made me nervous. Our apartment on Euclid Avenue was about nine miles south of the Chicago Loop, which with its glittering skyscrapers and crowded sidewalks felt otherworldly to me.

<div class="line_en">It would be years before I fully understood what driving the car meant to my father. As a kid, I could only sense it -- the liberation he felt behind the wheel, the pleasure he took in having a smooth-running engine and perfectly balanced tires humming beneath him. He'd been in his thirties when a doctor informed him that the odd weakness he'd started to feel in one leg was just the beginning of a long and probably painful slide toward immobility, that odds were that someday, due to a mysterious unsheathing of neurons in his brain and spinal cord, he'd find himself unable to walk at all. I don't have the precise dates, but it seems that the Buick came into my father's life at roughly the same time that multiple sclerosis did. And though he never said it, the car had to provide some sort of sideways relief.</div>

<div class="line_en">The diagnosis was not something he or my mother dwelled upon. We were decades, still, from a time when a simple Google search would bring up a head-spinning array of charts, statistics, and medical explainers that either gave or took away hope. I doubt he would have wanted to see them anyway. Although my father was raised in the church, he wouldn't have prayed for God to spare him. He wouldn't have looked for alternative treatments or a guru or some faulty gene to blame. In my family, we have a long-standing habit of blocking out bad news, of trying to forget about it almost the moment it arrives. Nobody knew how long my father had been feeling poorly before he first took himself to the doctor, but my guess is it had already been months if not years. He didn't like medical appointments. He wasn't interested in complaining. He was the sort of person who accepted what came and just kept moving forward.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="关于这种病，父亲和母亲都没有多考虑。那时候，还需要再过几十年才有谷歌，才能一搜就有一堆让人眼花缭乱的图表、数据和医学解释，带来或带走希望。即使当时有这些，我猜父亲也不愿意看。虽然父亲从小就去教堂，但他应该不会乞求上帝祛除他的病。他也不会寻找替代疗法或权威专家，又或者怪罪某个有缺陷的基因。在我的家族中，我们有一个由来已久的习惯，那就是屏蔽坏消息，在它到来的那一刻就忘掉它。没人知道父亲在看医生之前已经有多长时间感觉不舒服，我猜测不是几年也得有几个月。他不喜欢看医生，也不会怨天尤人。他是那种接受命运安排、一门心思往前看的人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I do know that on the day of my big piano recital, he was already walking with a slight limp, his left foot unable to catch up to his right. All my memories of my father include some manifestation of his disability, even if none of us were quite willing to call it that yet. What I knew at the time was that my dad moved a bit more slowly than other dads. I sometimes saw him pausing before walking up a flight of stairs, as if needing to think through the maneuver before actually attempting it. When we went shopping at the mall, he'd park himself on a bench, content to watch the bags or sneak in a nap while the rest of the family roamed freely.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我清楚地记得，在我参加钢琴演奏会的重要日子，他走路已经有点跛，左脚跟不上右脚的步伐。我对父亲的所有记忆里都有他残疾的样子，虽然我们都不愿意用这个词。当时我只知道，父亲比其他小孩的父亲走路要慢一点儿。我有时看见他在爬一段楼梯前会停住，似乎需要想想怎么爬再行动。我们去商场购物时，他会坐在长凳上，帮忙看包或者打个盹儿，让其他人去逛。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Riding downtown for the piano recital, I sat in the backseat of the Buick wearing a nice dress and patent leather shoes, my hair in pigtails, experiencing the first cold sweat of my life. I was anxious about performing, even though back at home in Robbie's apartment I'd practiced my song practically to death. Craig, too, was in a suit and prepared to play his own song. But the prospect of it wasn't bothering him. He was sound asleep, in fact, knocked out cold in the backseat, his mouth agape, his expression blissful and unworried. This was Craig. I'd spend a lifetime admiring him for his ease. He was playing by then in a Biddy Basketball league that had games every weekend and apparently had already tamed his nerves around performing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到市中心参加钢琴演奏会的路上，我坐在别克车的后座，穿着一件漂亮的裙子和一双漆皮鞋，扎着辫子，生平第一次紧张得直冒汗。我对于演奏很焦虑，虽然我已经在萝比家把曲子练得滚瓜烂熟。克雷格也参加这次演奏会，他穿着一身西装，似乎并不紧张，还在车后座上睡着了。事实上，他睡得很死，嘴半张着，表情愉快而平静。这就是克雷格。我这辈子都梦想可以像他那样淡然从容。他当时参加了青少年篮球联赛，每周末都会比赛，显然对现场表演这档子事已经驾轻就熟。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My father would often pick a lot as close to our destination as possible, shelling out more money for parking to minimize how far he'd have to walk on his unsteady legs. That day, we found Roosevelt University with no trouble and made our way up to what seemed like an enormous, echoing hall where the recital would take place. I felt tiny inside it. The room had elegant floor-to-ceiling windows through which you could see the wide lawns of Grant Park and, beyond that, the white-capped swells of Lake Michigan. There were steel-gray chairs arranged in orderly rows, slowly filling with nervous kids and expectant parents. And at the front, on a raised stage, were the first two baby grand pianos I'd ever laid eyes on, their giant hardwood tops propped open like black bird wings. Robbie was there, too, bustling about in a floral-print dress like the belle of the ball -- albeit a matronly belle -- making sure all her students had arrived with sheet music in hand. She shushed the room to silence when it was time for the show to begin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="父亲经常会花很长时间挑选停车地点，为的是与目的地尽可能地接近，这样就要多付一笔钱，但可以让他少走几步路。那天，我们很顺利地找到了罗斯福大学，走进了那个看起来巨大的有回声的大厅，钢琴演奏会就在这里举行。走进大厅，我感觉自己很渺小。大厅装着典雅的落地窗，从那里可以望见格兰特公园的大片草坪，远处还可以看到密歇根湖白色细浪腾起的湖面。大厅内整齐地排列着一排排青灰色的座椅，人慢慢多起来，都是紧张的孩子和满怀期待的父母。在大厅前部，高出地面的舞台上，放着两架小型三角钢琴，这是我有生以来第一次看到这种钢琴，它们那被撑开的巨大的硬木顶盖，就像黑色的翅膀。萝比已经到了，她穿着一条印花长裙，正在忙碌，看起来就像舞会上的美人，不过是上了年纪有点儿发福的美人。她要确保所有学生手里都拿着要演奏曲子的活页乐谱。当演出开始时，她示意全场安静下来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And yet there was a problem, one I discovered in the split second it took to lift my little fingers to the keys. I was sitting at a perfect piano, it turned out, with its surfaces carefully dusted, its internal wires precisely tuned, its eighty-eight keys laid out in a flawless ribbon of black and white. The issue was that I wasn't used to flawless. In fact, I'd never once in my life encountered it. My experience of the piano came entirely from Robbie's squat little music room with its scraggly potted plant and view of our modest backyard. The only instrument I'd ever played was her less-than-perfect upright, with its honky-tonk patchwork of yellowed keys and its conveniently chipped middle C. To me, that's what a piano was -- the same way my neighborhood was my neighborhood, my dad was my dad, my life was my life. It was all I knew.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是有一个问题，当我小小的手指放在琴键上的一瞬间我就发现了这个问题—放在我面前的是一架完美的钢琴，它的表面被仔细地擦拭过，琴弦的音调得很准，八十八个琴键完美地排列着，就像一条黑白相间的缎带。但问题是，我不习惯完美无瑕。事实上，我有生以来从没有见过完美无瑕的东西。我关于钢琴的所有经验都来自萝比那间低矮的小音乐室，屋里有盆乱蓬蓬的盆栽，窗外是我们简朴的后院。我唯一摸过的乐器就是她那台不完美的立式钢琴，上面的琴键已经泛黄，中央C音键有个缺口。对我来说，那才是钢琴的样子，就像我的社区是我的社区、我的父亲是我的父亲、我的生活是我的生活一样，那才是我认识的钢琴。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I don't recall who played in what order that day. I only know that when it was my turn, I got up from my seat and walked with my very best posture to the front of the room, mounting the stairs and finding my seat at one of the gleaming baby grands. The truth is I was ready. As much as I found Robbie to be snippy and inflexible, I'd also internalized her devotion to rigor. I knew my song so well I hardly had to think about it. I just had to start moving my hands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我记不清楚那天的演出顺序了，只知道轮到我的时候，我从座位上站起来，用最好的仪态走到大厅前面，走上舞台台阶，坐在其中一架闪闪发光的小型三角钢琴前。事实上我已经做好了准备。虽然我认为萝比急躁又顽固，但她对完美的苛求已经内化在我的身体里。我对于要演奏的曲目熟悉到根本不用思考，要做的只是动手而已。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Now, suddenly, I was aware of people watching me from their chairs as I stared hard at the high gloss of the piano keys, finding nothing there but sameness. I had no clue where to place my hands. With a tight throat and chugging heart, I looked out to the audience, trying not to telegraph my panic, searching for the safe harbor of my mother's face. Instead, I spotted a figure rising from the front row and slowly levitating in my direction. It was Robbie. We had brawled plenty by then, to the point where I viewed her a little bit like an enemy. But here in my moment of comeuppance, she arrived at my shoulder almost like an angel. Maybe she understood my shock. Maybe she knew that the disparities of the world had just quietly shown themselves to me for the first time. It's possible she needed simply to hurry things up. Either way, without a word, Robbie gently laid one finger on middle C so that I would know where to start. Then, turning back with the smallest smile of encouragement, she left me to play my song.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那一刻，我突然意识到台下坐着的观众在盯着我看，而我正盯着那些光滑闪亮的琴键，它们看起来一模一样。我不知道手该怎么放。我喉咙发紧，心扑通扑通地跳，但努力掩饰着自己的紧张情绪向观众席望去，想寻找母亲那张熟悉的脸。这时，我看到一个身影从前排站起来，慢慢地朝我的方向飘过来—是萝比。在那之前我们已有过多次争吵，我已经有点儿把她视为敌人。但就在我感到窘迫的时刻，她像天使一样来到我身旁。也许她明白我的感觉，也许她知道世界的差异正在无声地向我第一次展现，也可能她只是想加快演奏速度。不管怎样，萝比没有说一句话，只是把一根手指放在中央C音键上，让我知道从哪里开始。然后，她转过身，带着一丝不易察觉的鼓励的微笑，让我开始演奏。">查看中文翻译</div>
