<div class="line_en">He had walked several kilometres over pavements, and his varicose ulcer was throbbing. This was the second time in three weeks that he had missed an evening at the Community Centre: a rash act, since you could be certain that the number of your attendances at the Centre was carefully checked. In principle a Party member had no spare time, and was never alone except in bed. It was assumed that when he was not working, eating or sleeping he would be taking part in some kind of communal recreation: to do anything that suggested a taste for solitude, even to go for a walk by yourself, was always slightly dangerous. There was a word for it in Newspeak: ownlife, it was called, meaning individualism and eccentricity. But this evening as he came out of the Ministry the balminess of the April air had tempted him. The sky was a warmer blue than he had seen it that year, and suddenly the long, noisy evening at the Centre, the boring, exhausting games, the lectures, the creaking camaraderie oiled by gin, had seemed intolerable. On impulse he had turned away from the bus-stop and wandered off into the labyrinth of London, first south, then east, then north again, losing himself among unknown streets and hardly bothering in which direction he was going.</div>

<div class="line_en">From somewhere at the bottom of a passage the smell of roasting coffee -- real coffee, not Victory Coffee -- came floating out into the street. Winston paused involuntarily.

<div class="line_en">"If there is hope," he had written in the diary, "it lies in the proles." The words kept coming back to him, statement of a mystical truth and a palpable absurdity. He was somewhere in the vague, brown-coloured slums to the north and east of what had once been Saint Pancras Station. He was walking up a cobbled street of little two-storey houses with battered doorways which gave straight on the pavement and which were somehow curiously suggestive of rat-holes. There were puddles of filthy water here and there among the cobbles. In and out of the dark doorways, and down narrow alleyways that branched off on either side, people swarmed in astonishing numbers -- girls in full bloom, with crudely lipsticked mouths, and youths who chased the girls, and swollen waddling women who showed you what the girls would be like in ten years' time, and old bent creatures shuffling along on splayed feet, and ragged barefooted children who played in the puddles and then scattered at angry yells from their mothers. Perhaps a quarter of the windows in the street were broken and boarded up. Most of the people paid no attention to Winston; a few eyed him with a sort of guarded curiosity. Two monstrous women with brick-red forearms folded across their aprons were talking outside a doorway. Winston caught scraps of conversation as he approached.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“如果有希望，”他在日记中写道，“希望在无产者身上。”他又想起这句话，这是神秘真相的一种说明，也是显而易见的荒诞。他现在来到一片暗淡、褐色的棚户区，它的东南面曾经就是圣潘克拉斯火车站。他走上一条铺有鹅卵石的街道，两边有小巧的两层楼房，破旧的大门对着人行道，给人一种老鼠洞的奇怪感觉。鹅卵石的街面上有一摊摊脏水。黑乎乎的门洞里外，街道两侧的小巷子里，到处都是人，数量惊人——姑娘们正当花季，嘴唇上抹着口红；小伙子追逐着姑娘；臃肿蹒跚的女人让人想起姑娘十年以后的模样；弯腰驼背的老人迈着难看的步子；衣衫褴褛、光着脚板的孩子在脏水坑里玩耍，因着他们母亲的呵斥声又一哄而散。街上的窗户或许有四分之一是破的，用板钉着。大多数人并不注意温斯顿，有几个人带着好奇而又警觉的眼神看着他。两个穿着围裙，交叉着红棕色手臂的胖女人在门口说话。温斯顿走近时听到她们交谈的只言片语。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The strident voices stopped abruptly. The women studied him in hostile silence as he went past. But it was not hostility, exactly; merely a kind of wariness, a momentary stiffening, as at the passing of some unfamiliar animal. The blue overalls of the Party could not be a common sight in a street like this. Indeed, it was unwise to be seen in such places, unless you had definite business there. The patrols might stop you if you happened to run into them. "May I see your papers, comrade? What are you doing here? What time did you leave work? Is this your usual way home?" -- and so on and so forth. Not that there was any rule against walking home by an unusual route: but it was enough to draw attention to you if the Thought Police heard about it.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Steamer" was a nickname which, for some reason, the proles applied to rocket bombs. Winston promptly flung himself on his face. The proles were nearly always right when they gave you a warning of this kind. They seemed to possess some kind of instinct which told them several seconds in advance when a rocket was coming, although the rockets supposedly travelled faster than sound. Winston clasped his forearms above his head. There was a roar that seemed to make the pavement heave; a shower of light objects pattered onto his back. When he stood up he found that he was covered with fragments of glass from the nearest window.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“汽弹”是一个外号，无产者用来指火箭弹。温斯顿猛地朝他转过脸去。当无产者对你发出这样的警告，他们差不多总是正确的。他们似乎拥有某种直觉，当火箭飞过来时，他们提前几秒钟就有预感，虽然这种火箭据说飞得比声音还快。温斯顿用手臂护住头。一声呼啸似乎使得人行道抖动起来，有什么东西像阵雨似的落到他的背上。他爬起来一看，那是从附近窗户上掉下来的碎玻璃。">查看中文翻译</div>

A young woman leapt out of a doorway a little ahead of Winston, grabbed up a tiny child playing in a puddle, whipped her apron round it and leapt back again, all in one movement. At the same instant a man in a concertina-like black suit, who had emerged from a side-alley, ran towards Winston, pointing excitedly to the sky.</div>

<div class="line_en">He walked on. The bomb had demolished a group of houses two hundred metres up the street. A black plume of smoke hung in the sky, and below it a cloud of plaster dust in which a crowd was already forming round the ruins. There was a little pile of plaster lying on the pavement ahead of him, and in the middle of it he could see a bright red streak. When he got up to it he saw that it was a human hand severed at the wrist. Apart from the bloody stump, the hand was so completely whitened as to resemble a plaster cast.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他又往前走。炸弹将街前边两百米处的一排房子夷为平地。一股浓烟升入空中，地上则扬起一团粉尘，废墟旁已围着一群人。他前面的人行道上有一小堆瓦砾，他看到中间有一条鲜红的痕迹。走近了才看清是一只手腕处炸断的手。除了断口处鲜血淋淋，那只手已经完全发白，犹如一只石膏模型。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He kicked the thing into the gutter, and then, to avoid the crowd, turned down a side-street to the right. Within three or four minutes he was out of the area which the bomb had affected, and the sordid swarming life of the streets was going on as though nothing had happened. It was nearly twenty hours, and the drinking-shops which the proles frequented ("pubs", they called them) were choked with customers. From their grimy swing doors, endlessly opening and shutting, there came forth a smell of urine, sawdust and sour beer. In an angle formed by a projecting housefront three men were standing very close together, the middle one of them holding a folded-up newspaper which the other two were studying over his shoulders. Even before he was near enough to make out the expression on their faces, Winston could see absorption in every line of their bodies. It was obviously some serious piece of news that they were reading. He was a few paces away from them when suddenly the group broke up and two of the men were in violent altercation. For a moment they seemed almost on the point of blows.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他将它踢到沟里，随后避开人群，拐向右边的一条小路。三四分钟后，他已经离开那个被炸的地区，街上拥挤嘈杂的生活一如往常，好像什么都没有发生一样。现在差不多是晚上八点，无产者光顾的小酒店（他们叫做“酒馆”）挤满了顾客。满是灰尘的弹簧门不停地开开关关，散发出一股尿臊、木屑和酸啤酒的味道。在房子正面凸出的一个角落，有三个男子紧挨着站在一起，中间那个拿着一张折叠起来的报纸，另外两个从他的肩膀上看那报纸。温斯顿还没走过去看清他们脸上的表情，就知道他们对那份报纸全神贯注。显然他们在看某个重大新闻。他离他们还有几步远时，这伙人突然爆发出冲突，其中两个激烈地争吵起来。看上去他们几乎快要打起来了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They were talking about the Lottery. Winston looked back when he had gone thirty metres. They were still arguing, with vivid, passionate faces. The Lottery, with its weekly pay-out of enormous prizes, was the one public event to which the proles paid serious attention. It was probable that there were some millions of proles for whom the Lottery was the principal if not the only reason for remaining alive. It was their delight, their folly, their anodyne, their intellectual stimulant. Where the Lottery was concerned, even people who could barely read and write seemed capable of intricate calculations and staggering feats of memory. There was a whole tribe of men who made a living simply by selling systems, forecasts and lucky amulets. Winston had nothing to do with the running of the Lottery, which was managed by the Ministry of Plenty, but he was aware (indeed everyone in the Party was aware) that the prizes were largely imaginary. Only small sums were actually paid out, the winners of the big prizes being non-existent persons. In the absence of any real intercommunication between one part of Oceania and another, this was not difficult to arrange.</div>

<div class="line_en">But if there was hope, it lay in the proles. You had to cling on to that. When you put it in words it sounded reasonable: it was when you looked at the human beings passing you on the pavement that it became an act of faith. The street into which he had turned ran downhill. He had a feeling that he had been in this neighbourhood before, and that there was a main thoroughfare not far away. From somewhere ahead there came a din of shouting voices. The street took a sharp turn and then ended in a flight of steps which led down into a sunken alley where a few stall-keepers were selling tired-looking vegetables. At this moment Winston remembered where he was. The alley led out into the main street, and down the next turning, not five minutes away, was the junk shop where he had bought the blank book which was now his diary. And in a small stationer's shop not far away he had bought his penholder and his bottle of ink.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但如果有希望，希望在无产者身上。你得坚信这一点。当你用文字表达时，这听起来就很有道理。当你看一下人行道上走过的行人，这就成了一个信仰的行为。他拐进去的这条街是个下坡路。他觉得以前来过这儿，不远就有一条大街。前面什么地方传来叫喊声。街道有个急转弯，尽头便是一段台阶，通向一个地势较低的小巷，那儿有一些摊贩在卖已经不新鲜的蔬菜。这时，温斯顿想起他在什么地方了。这条小巷通向那条大街，过了下一个转弯，不用五分钟，就到了他买那本空白本子的旧货店，这本子他现在用来写日记。在不远的一家文具店，他买了笔杆和一瓶墨水。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He paused for a moment at the top of the steps. On the opposite side of the alley there was a dingy little pub whose windows appeared to be frosted over but in reality were merely coated with dust. A very old man, bent but active, with white moustaches that bristled forward like those of a prawn, pushed open the swing door and went in. As Winston stood watching it occurred to him that the old man, who must be eighty at the least, had already been middle-aged when the Revolution happened. He and a few others like him were the last links that now existed with the vanished world of capitalism. In the Party itself there were not many people left whose ideas had been formed before the Revolution. The older generation had mostly been wiped out in the great purges of the "fifties and "sixties, and the few who survived had long ago been terrified into complete intellectual surrender. If there was anyone still alive who could give you a truthful account of conditions in the early part of the century, it could only be a prole. Suddenly the passage from the history book that he had copied into his diary came back into Winston's mind, and a lunatic impulse took hold of him. He would go into the pub, he would scrape acquaintance with that old man and question him. He would say to him: "Tell me about your life when you were a boy. What was it like in those days? Were things better than they are now, or were they worse?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他在最上面的台阶处停了一会儿。在小巷的另一头，有一家脏兮兮的小酒馆，窗户像是结了一层霜，但其实是蒙了一层灰。一个老汉，驼着腰，但很精神，白胡须像虾一样向前翘起。他推开弹簧门走了进去。温斯顿站在那儿，他觉得这老人至少有八十岁了，发生革命时，他已是中年。他和其他一些像他这样的人是现存的与已消失的资本主义世界的最后的联系了。在党内，其思想在革命前形成的人为数不多了。老一代人中，大多数在五六十年代的大清洗中已被消灭，少数幸存者很久前已经被改造成彻底的思想顺从者了。如果还有人活着，能够给你真实地讲述本世纪初期的社会状况，那只能是无产者了。他突然想起他从历史书上抄到日记中的一段话。他想走进小酒馆，设法认识那个老人，向他提问。他会问他：“请告诉我你的童年生活。那时候的生活怎么样？比现在好还是比现在坏？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Hurriedly, lest he should have time to become frightened, he descended the steps and crossed the narrow street. It was madness, of course. As usual, there was no definite rule against talking to proles and frequenting their pubs, but it was far too unusual an action to pass unnoticed. If the patrols appeared he might plead an attack of faintness, but it was not likely that they would believe him. He pushed open the door, and a hideous cheesy smell of sour beer hit him in the face. As he entered the din of voices dropped to about half its volume. Behind his back he could feel everyone eyeing his blue overalls. A game of darts which was going on at the other end of the room interrupted itself for perhaps as much as thirty seconds. The old man whom he had followed was standing at the bar, having some kind of altercation with the barman, a large, stout, hook-nosed young man with enormous forearms. A knot of others, standing round with glasses in their hands, were watching the scene.</div>

The proles were supposed not to drink gin, though in practice they could get hold of it easily enough. The game of darts was in full swing again, and the knot of men at the bar had begun talking about lottery tickets. Winston's presence was forgotten for a moment.

The history books say that life before the Revolution was completely different from what it is now. There was the most terrible oppression, injustice, poverty -- worse than anything we can imagine. Here in London, the great mass of the people never had enough to eat from birth to death. Half of them hadn't even boots on their feet. They worked twelve hours a day, they left school at nine, they slept ten in a room. And at the same time there were a very few people, only a few thousands -- the capitalists, they were called -- who were rich and powerful. They owned everything that there was to own.

<div class="line_en">Winston sat back against the window sill. It was no use going on. He was about to buy some more beer when the old man suddenly got up and shuffled rapidly into the stinking urinal at the side of the room. The extra half-litre was already working on him. Winston sat for a minute or two gazing at his empty glass, and hardly noticed when his feet carried him out into the street again. Within twenty years at the most, he reflected, the huge and simple question, "Was life better before the Revolution than it is now?" would have ceased once and for all to be answerable. But in effect it was unanswerable even now, since the few scattered survivors from the ancient world were incapable of comparing one age with another. They remembered a million useless things, a quarrel with a workmate, a hunt for a lost bicycle pump, the expression on a long-dead sister's face, the swirls of dust on a windy morning seventy years ago: but all the relevant facts were outside the range of their vision. They were like the ant, which can see small objects but not large ones. And when memory failed and written records were falsified -- when that happened, the claim of the Party to have improved the conditions of human life had got to be accepted, because there did not exist, and never again could exist, any standard against which it could be tested.</div>

At the same time he noticed that although it was nearly twenty-one hours the shop was still open.

Only on a small table in the corner was there a litter of odds and ends -- lacquered snuff-boxes, agate brooches and the like -- which looked as though they might include something interesting.

<div class="line_en">Winston immediately paid over the four dollars and slid the coveted thing into his pocket. What appealed to him about it was not so much its beauty as the air it seemed to possess of belonging to an age quite different from the present one. The soft, rain-watery glass was not like any glass that he had ever seen. The thing was doubly attractive because of its apparent uselessness, though he could guess that it must once have been intended as a paperweight. It was very heavy in his pocket, but fortunately it did not make much of a bulge. It was a queer thing, even a compromising thing, for a Party member to have in his possession. Anything old, and for that matter anything beautiful, was always vaguely suspect. The old man had grown noticeably more cheerful after receiving the four dollars. Winston realised that he would have accepted three or even two.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="温斯顿马上付了四元钱，把那件中意的宝贝揣进了口袋。吸引他的主要不是它的漂亮，而是他能拥有一件属于与现代截然不同的一个时代的东西。这块温润、雨水般的玻璃不同于他见过的任何一块玻璃。因其无所用处的外观，就格外具有魅力，虽然他猜测它可能会被用作镇纸。它在口袋里沉甸甸的，但幸运的是，它并不使口袋显得鼓鼓囊囊。一个党员拥有这样的东西，是一件古怪的事，甚至是一件不宜声张的事。任何陈旧的东西，尤其是美的东西，总会招来莫名其妙的猜疑。老人收下四元钱后心情明显欢快多了。温斯顿意识到三元，甚至两元他也会卖的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He was holding the lamp high up, so as to illumine the whole room, and in the warm dim light the place looked curiously inviting. The thought flitted through Winston's mind that it would probably be quite easy to rent the room for a few dollars a week, if he dared to take the risk. It was a wild, impossible notion, to be abandoned as soon as thought of; but the room had awakened in him a sort of nostalgia, a sort of ancestral memory. It seemed to him that he knew exactly what it felt like to sit in a room like this, in an armchair beside an open fire with your feet in the fender and a kettle on the hob: utterly alone, utterly secure, with nobody watching you, no voice pursuing you, no sound except the singing of the kettle and the friendly ticking of the clock.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他把灯举起来，以便把整个房间照亮，在温暖而又暗淡的灯光下，这房间看上去有一种奇特的亲切感。温斯顿突然产生了一个念头，也许他每星期花几块钱就能轻易租下这个房间，如果他能冒这个险的话。这是一个大胆的非分之想，刚想起就应该马上丢弃；但这个房间唤醒了他心中的一种怀旧，一种原始记忆。他好像很清楚坐在这样的房间里有什么样的感觉，坐在欢快的炉火旁的扶手椅里，脚放在壁炉的栅栏上，水壶放在搁架上：多么清静、多么安详，没有人看着你，没有声音骚扰你，除了水壶的歌唱和时钟友好的滴答声，没有其他的噪音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We lived here till my wife died," said the old man half apologetically. "I'm selling the furniture off by little and little.

<div class="line_en">He lit another lamp, and, with bowed back, led the way slowly up the steep and worn stairs and along a tiny passage, into a room which did not give on the street but looked out on a cobbled yard and a forest of chimney pots. Winston noticed that the furniture was still arranged as though the room were meant to be lived in. There was a strip of carpet on the floor, a picture or two on the walls, and a deep, slatternly armchair drawn up to the fireplace. An old-fashioned glass clock with a twelve-hour face was ticking away on the mantelpiece. Under the window, and occupying nearly a quarter of the room, was an enormous bed with the mattress still on it.</div>

<div class="line_en">Winston wondered vaguely to what century the church belonged. It was always difficult to determine the age of a London building. Anything large and impressive, if it was reasonably new in appearance, was automatically claimed as having been built since the Revolution, while anything that was obviously of earlier date was ascribed to some dim period called the Middle Ages. The centuries of capitalism were held to have produced nothing of any value. One could not learn history from architecture any more than one could learn it from books. Statues, inscriptions, memorial stones, the names of streets -- anything that might throw light upon the past had been systematically altered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="温斯顿模模糊糊地想这教堂是哪个世纪的。要想确定伦敦一座建筑的年代总是很困难。任何一座大型建筑，要是外观比较新，就自然地被认为是革命以后建造的，而明显的老建筑就会被归于名为中世纪的那个黑暗时期。资本主义的几个世纪被认为没有产生任何有价值的东西。比起书本来，人们从建筑中更学不到什么东西。雕像、碑文、纪念碑、街道的名称——任何有可能帮助人们认识过去的东西都被系统地篡改了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Winston did not buy the picture. It would have been an even more incongruous possession than the glass paperweight, and impossible to carry home, unless it were taken out of its frame. But he lingered for some minutes more, talking to the old man, whose name, he discovered, was not Weeks -- as one might have gathered from the inscription over the shopfront -- but Charrington. Mr Charrington, it seemed, was a widower aged sixty-three and had inhabited this shop for thirty years. Throughout that time he had been intending to alter the name over the window, but had never quite got to the point of doing it. All the while that they were talking the half-remembered rhyme kept running through Winston's head. Oranges and lemons, say the bells of St Clement's, You owe me three farthings, say the bells of St Martin's! It was curious, but when you said it to yourself you had the illusion of actually hearing bells, the bells of a lost London that still existed somewhere or other, disguised and forgotten. From one ghostly steeple after another he seemed to hear them pealing forth. Yet so far as he could remember he had never in real life heard church bells ringing.</div>

It was too great a coincidence. Whether she was really an agent of the Thought Police, or simply an amateur spy actuated by officiousness, hardly mattered. It was enough that she was watching him.

As he turned it occurred to him that the girl had only passed him three minutes ago and that by running he could probably catch up with her. He could keep on her track till they were in some quiet place, and then smash her skull in with a cobblestone. The piece of glass in his pocket would be heavy enough for the job. But he abandoned the idea immediately, because even the thought of making any physical effort was unbearable. He could not run, he could not strike a blow. Besides, she was young and lusty and would defend herself. He thought also of hurrying to the Community Centre and staying there till the place closed, so as to establish a partial alibi for the evening. But that too was impossible.

<div class="line_en">It was after twenty-two hours when he got back to the flat. The lights would be switched off at the main at twenty-three thirty. He went into the kitchen and swallowed nearly a teacupful of Victory Gin. Then he went to the table in the alcove, sat down and took the diary out of the drawer. But he did not open it at once. From the telescreen a brassy female voice was squalling a patriotic song. He sat staring at the marbled cover of the book, trying without success to shut the voice out of his consciousness.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was at night that they came for you, always at night. The proper thing was to kill yourself before they got you. Undoubtedly some people did so. Many of the disappearances were actually suicides. But it needed desperate courage to kill yourself in a world where firearms, or any quick and certain poison, were completely unprocurable. He thought with a kind of astonishment of the biological uselessness of pain and fear, the treachery of the human body which always freezes into inertia at exactly the moment when a special effort is needed. He might have silenced the dark-haired girl if only he had acted quickly enough: but precisely because of the extremity of his danger he had lost the power to act. It struck him that in moments of crisis one is never fighting against an external enemy, but always against one's own body. Even now, in spite of the gin, the dull ache in his belly made consecutive thought impossible. And it is the same, he perceived, in all seemingly heroic or tragic situations. On the battlefield, in the torture chamber, on a sinking ship, the issues that you are fighting for are always forgotten, because the body swells up until it fills the universe, and even when you are not paralysed by fright or screaming with pain, life is a moment-to-moment struggle against hunger or cold or sleeplessness, against a sour stomach or an aching tooth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们会在夜里来抓你，总是在夜里。最好在他们逮住你之前自我了断。无疑有人是这么做的。许多的失踪其实是自杀。但在你根本无法获得枪支，或任何速效而致命的毒药的这个世界上，自杀需要巨大的勇气。他惊讶地发现，生理上的疼痛和恐惧毫无意义，在需要身体作出特殊反应的时刻，身体总是背叛你，僵硬不动。要是他当时行动迅速的话，他就能将那个黑发女孩灭口；但就因为他处于岌岌可危的境地，反而失去了行动的力量。他想到，人在危急时刻不是同外部敌人战斗，而总是同自己的身体战斗。甚至现在，尽管喝了杜松子酒，肚子的隐痛还是使思想不能连贯。他意识到，在所有显得英雄或悲壮的情景中，情况都一样。在战场上，在审讯室，在沉船上，你为之战斗的东西总是被忘却，因为身体在膨胀，占据了一切；即使你没有被吓瘫或痛得大叫，生命也只是一场反对饥饿、寒冷或失眠，反对胃酸或牙疼的战斗。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He opened the diary. It was important to write something down. The woman on the telescreen had started a new song. Her voice seemed to stick into his brain like jagged splinters of glass. He tried to think of O'Brien, for whom, or to whom, the diary was written, but instead he began thinking of the things that would happen to him after the Thought Police took him away. It would not matter if they killed you at once. To be killed was what you expected. But before death (nobody spoke of such things, yet everybody knew of them) there was the routine of confession that had to be gone through: the grovelling on the floor and screaming for mercy, the crack of broken bones, the smashed teeth and bloody clots of hair. Why did you have to endure it, since the end was always the same? Why was it not possible to cut a few days or weeks out of your life? Nobody ever escaped detection, and nobody ever failed to confess. When once you had succumbed to thoughtcrime it was certain that by a given date you would be dead. Why then did that horror, which altered nothing, have to lie embedded in future time?</div>

<div class="line_en">He tried with a little more success than before to summon up the image of O'Brien. "We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness," O'Brien had said to him. He knew what it meant, or thought he knew. The place where there is no darkness was the imagined future, which one would never see, but which, by foreknowledge, one could mystically share in. But with the voice from the telescreen nagging at his ears he could not follow the train of thought further. He put a cigarette in his mouth. Half the tobacco promptly fell out onto his tongue, a bitter dust which was difficult to spit out again. The face of Big Brother swam into his mind, displacing that of O'Brien. Just as he had done a few days earlier, he slid a coin out of his pocket and looked at it. The face gazed up at him, heavy, calm, protecting: but what kind of smile was hidden beneath the dark moustache? Like a leaden knell the words came back at him:</div>
