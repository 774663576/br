<div class="line_en">The septry stood upon an upthrust island half a mile from the shore, where the wide mouth of the Trident widened further still to kiss the Bay of Crabs. Even from shore its prosperity was apparent. Its slope was covered with terraced fields, with fishponds down below and a windmill above, its wood-and-sailcloth blades turning slowly in the breeze off the bay. Brienne could see sheep grazing on the hillside and storks wading in the shallow waters around the ferry landing.</div>

<div class="line_en">The tide was going out now, and swiftly. The water that separated the island from the shore was receding, leaving behind a broad expanse of glistening brown mudflats dotted by tidal pools that glittered like golden coins in the afternoon sun. Brienne scratched the back of her neck, where an insect had bitten her. She had pinned her hair up, and the sun had warmed her skin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在正赶上退潮，而且退得很快，将岛屿与陆地隔离的河水急速后撤，留下一片广阔的褐色泥滩，微微泛光，一个个潮水坑遍布其中，在下午的阳光里像金币般闪烁。布蕾妮挠挠颈背，一只小虫咬了她一口。她已将头发盘起来，太阳照得皮肤暖洋洋的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Saltpans is just across the water," said Septon Meribald, pointing north across the bay. "The brothers will ferry us over on the morning tide, though I fear what we shall find there. Let us enjoy a good hot meal before we face that. The brothers always have a bone to spare for Dog." Dog barked and wagged his tail.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Those who dwell here are penitents, who seek to atone for their sins through contemplation, prayer, and silence. Only the Elder Brother and his proctors are permitted to speak, and the proctors only for one day of every seven."</div>

<div class="line_en">Septon Meribald smiled. "Mothers have been cowing their daughters with that tale since I was your age. There was no truth to it then and there is none now. A vow of silence is an act of contrition, a sacrifice by which we prove our devotion to the Seven Above. For a mute to take a vow of silence would be akin to a legless man giving up the dance." He led his donkey down the slope, beckoning them to follow. "If you would sleep beneath a roof tonight, you must climb off your horses and cross the mud with me. The path of faith, we call it. Only the faithful may cross safely. The wicked are swallowed by the quicksands, or drowned when the tide comes rushing in. None of you are wicked, I hope? Even so, I would be careful where I set my feet. Walk only where I walk, and you shall reach the other side."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="梅里巴德修士微微一笑。“我在你这个年纪时，我的长辈也如此吓唬孩子，其实无论何时何地，这说法都并非事实。立誓保持静默乃是表达忏悔的方式，作出牺牲来自己证明对天上七神的虔诚，哑巴发誓沉默就好比没腿的人宣言放弃舞蹈。”他牵驴子走下斜坡，招呼他们跟上。“如果今晚想睡在屋檐底下，现在就必须下马，随我一起穿越泥沼。我们称它为信仰之路，信仰坚贞的人才能安全通过，而心怀歹意的将会被流沙吞没，或在潮水涌回来时淹死。你们中没有人心怀歹意吧？即使如此，我仍会小心落脚之处。记住，只踩我踩过的地方，就能到达另一边。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The path of faith was a crooked one, Brienne could not help but note. Though the island seemed to rise to the northeast of where they left the shore, Septon Meribald did not make directly for it. Instead, he started due east, toward the deeper waters of the bay, which shimmered blue and silver in the distance. The soft brown mud squished up between his toes. As he walked he paused from time to time, to probe ahead with his quarterstaff. Dog stayed near his heels, sniffing at every rock, shell, and clump of seaweed. For once he did not bound ahead or stray.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布蕾妮发现信仰之路果真蜿蜒曲折，那座岛看起来耸立在西北方，梅里巴德修士却没直接朝它走，而是折向东方，往海湾中水深处进发。远处海水闪烁着银蓝色光芒，褐色烂泥“吱吱咯咯”地挤进他脚趾间，他不时停下来，用木杖试探前方。狗儿紧跟在他脚后，嗅着每一块岩石、每一只贝壳和每一丛海草。但这回它既没在前面蹦蹦跳跳，也没有四处游走。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Brienne followed, taking care to keep close to the line of prints left by the dog, the donkey, and the holy man. Then came Podrick, and last of all Ser Hyle. A hundred yards out, Meribald turned abruptly toward the south, so his back was almost to the septry. He proceeded in that direction for another hundred yards, leading them between two shallow tidal pools. Dog stuck his nose in one and yelped when a crab pinched it with his claw. A brief but furious struggle ensued before the dog came trotting back, wet and mud-spattered, with the crab between his jaws.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布蕾妮跟在后面，小心留意狗、驴子和修士留下的一排足印，然后是波德瑞克，海尔爵士收尾。一百码之后，梅里巴德突然转向南方，几乎背对修道院行进。他朝那个方向又走了一百码，带领他们从两个浅浅的潮水坑之间穿过。狗儿将鼻子探进其中一个，一只螃蟹用蝥夹它的鼻子，令它吠叫起来，接着是一场短暂但剧烈的搏斗，最后狗儿小跑着回来，浑身湿漉漉的，沾满烂泥，口中叼着那只螃蟹。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Three men were waiting for them as they clambered up the broken stones that ringed the isle's shoreline. They were clad in the brown-and-dun robes of brothers, with wide bell sleeves and pointed cowls. Two had wound lengths of wool about the lower halves of their faces as well, so all that could be seen of them were their eyes. The third brother was the one to speak. "Septon Meribald," he called. "It has been nigh upon a year. You are welcome. Your companions as well."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们爬过环绕岛岸的碎石堆，三个人正在等候。他们穿修士兄弟的棕褐长袍，袍子有宽大的钟形袖口和尖顶兜帽，其中两位还用长长的羊毛布裹住脸的下半部分，只能看见眼睛。开口说话的是第三位。“梅里巴德修士，”他大声说，“差不多一年没见了。欢迎你，还有你的伙伴们。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The flats shimmered wetly all about them, mottled in half a hundred hues. The mud was such a dark brown it appeared almost black, but there were swathes of golden sand as well, upthrust rocks both grey and red, and tangles of black and green seaweed. Storks stalked through the tidal pools and left their footprints all around them, and crabs scuttled across the surface of shallow waters. The air smelled of brine and rot, and the ground sucked at their feet and let them go only reluctantly, with a pop and a squelchy sigh. Septon Meribald turned and turned again and yet again. His footprints filled up with water as soon as he moved on. By the time the ground grew firmer and began to rise beneath the feet, they had walked at least a mile and a half.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="泥滩在周围泛着潮湿的光，映衬出近百种斑驳色调。烂泥是深黯的褐色，差不多跟黑的一样，但也有一片片金色沙地，一块块灰色与红色的突起岩石，以及一丛丛黑色与绿色的海草。鹳鸟在潮水坑中跋涉，留下许多脚印，螃蟹则在浅滩表面疾走。空气带有海盐和腐败的味道，泥巴吸住人们的脚，直到人们用力，才“啪”的一声不情不愿地放开，伴随着吱吱嘎嘎的叹息。梅里巴德修士转了一个又一个弯，留下的脚印里很快注满了水。等地面变得坚固，并开始上升，她估计至少走了一里半路。">查看中文翻译</div>

When we sought to harness him to a plow he kicked Brother Rawney and broke his shinbone in two places. We had hoped gelding might improve the beast's ill temper, but… Brother Gillam, will you show them?" Brother Gillam lowered his cowl.

<div class="line_en">They passed a dozen brothers of the order on their way up; cowled men in dun-andbrown who gave them curious looks as they went by, but spoke no word of greeting. One was leading a pair of milk cows toward a low barn roofed in sod; another worked a butter churn. On the upper slopes they saw three boys driving sheep, and higher still they passed a lichyard where a brother bigger than Brienne was struggling to dig a grave. From the way he moved, it was plain to see that he was lame. As he flung a spadeful of the stony soil over one shoulder, some chanced to spatter against their feet. "Be more watchful there," chided Brother Narbert. "Septon Meribald might have gotten a mouthful of dirt." The gravedigger lowered his head. When Dog went to sniff him he dropped his spade and scratched his ear.</div>

The sept had windows of leaded glass, wide doors carved with likenesses of the Mother and the Father, and a seven-sided steeple with a walk on top.

<div class="line_en">The Elder Brother was not what Brienne had expected. He could hardly be called elder, for a start; whereas the brothers weeding in the garden had had the stooped shoulders and bent backs of old men, he stood straight and tall, and moved with the vigor of a man in the prime of his years. Nor did he have the gentle, kindly face she expected of a healer. His head was large and square, his eyes shrewd, his nose veined and red. Though he wore a tonsure, his scalp was as stubbly as his heavy jaw. He looks more like a man made to break bones than to heal one, thought the Maid of Tarth, as the Elder Brother strode across the room to embrace Septon Meribald and pat Dog. "It is always a glad day when our friends Meribald and Dog honor us with another visit," he announced, before turning to his other guests. "And new faces are always welcome. We see so few of them."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="长老跟布蕾妮想象的大不一样。首先，他几乎算不上长者，菜园里除草的兄弟都是弯腰驼背的老人，他却高大挺拔，充满活力，正当壮年；其次，他的脸不象她想象中的医疗圣人那般和蔼慈祥。他脑袋大而方，眼睛敏锐精明，鼻子布满红色纹路。尽管他削过发，但头顶跟厚实的下巴都布满短须。他不像是位能给人接骨疗伤的圣人，反倒像是随时要折断别人关节的打手，塔斯的处女心想。长老穿过屋子，拥抱梅里巴德修士，又轻轻拍了拍狗儿。“每次我们的朋友梅里巴德和狗儿来访，总是个快乐的日子，”他宣告，然后转身面对其他宾客。“我们也欢迎新面孔。啊，最近见到的新面孔太少了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Perhaps two thousand years ago the Hermit's Hole had been a damp, dark place, floored with dirt and echoing to the sounds of dripping water, but no longer. The cave that Brienne and her companions entered had been turned into a warm, snug sanctum. Woolen carpets covered the ground, tapestries the walls. Tall beeswax candles gave more than ample light. The furnishings were strange but simple; a long table, a settle, a chest, several tall cases full of books, and chairs. All were made from driftwood, oddly shaped pieces cunningly joined together and polished till they shone a deep gold in the candlelight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两千年前，隐士洞也许阴暗潮湿，泥土遍布，回荡着滴水声，现在早已改观。布蕾妮与伙伴们进入的山洞变成一间温暖舒适的密室，地板铺羊毛毯，墙壁覆盖织锦，长长的蜂蜡烛散发出充裕的光线，家具样式奇异而朴素，包括一张长桌、一条高背长凳、一个箱子，几只摆满书籍的高大书柜，还有一些椅子。它们全用浮木制成，奇形怪状的木条巧妙地拼凑起来，打磨抛光，在烛光之下泛出暗金色。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Meribald performed the customary courtesies before seating himself upon the settle. Unlike Septon Narbert, the Elder Brother did not seem dismayed by Brienne's sex, but his smile did flicker and fade when the septon told him why she and Ser Hyle had come. "I see," was all he said, before he turned away with, "You must be thirsty. Please, have some of our sweet cider to wash the dust of travel from your throats." He poured for them himself. The cups were carved from driftwood too, no two the same. When Brienne complimented them, he said, "My lady is too kind. All we do is cut and polish the wood. We are blessed here. Where the river meets the bay, the currents and the tides wrestle one against the other, and many strange and wondrous things are pushed toward us, to wash up on our shores. Driftwood is the least of it. We have found silver cups and iron pots, sacks of wool and bolts of silk, rusted helms and shining swords… aye, and rubies."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="梅里巴德照例客套一番，然后落座于高背长凳上。与纳伯特修士不同，长老并没因布蕾妮的性别而不安，但当修士提起布蕾妮和海尔爵士旅行的原因时，他还是收起了笑容，只说句“我明白了。”便将话题岔开。“你们一定渴了。请尝尝我们的甜苹果酒，润一润经历旅途风尘的嗓子。”他亲自给他们倒酒。杯子也由浮木制成，没有两只是相同的。当布蕾妮表示赞赏时，他回答说，“小姐您过奖，我们只不过将木头雕刻抛光，加以利用罢了。在这个地方，我们受到诸神的保佑，河流与海湾交接处，河水与潮水互相角力，许多稀奇古怪的东西因而被冲上岸堤，馈赠给我们。浮木在其中算是最不起眼，我们找到过银杯、铁锅、一袋袋羊毛、一卷卷丝绸，生锈的头盔，闪亮的宝剑…对了，甚至还有红宝石呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Too many corpses, these days." The Elder Brother sighed. "Our gravedigger knows no rest. Rivermen, westermen, northmen, all wash up here. Knights and knaves alike. We bury them side by side, Stark and Lannister, Blackwood and Bracken, Frey and Darry. That is the duty the river asks of us in return for all its gifts, and we do it as best we can. Sometimes we find a woman, though… or worse, a little child. Those are the cruelest gifts." He turned to Septon Meribald. "I hope that you have time to absolve us of our sins. Since the raiders slew old Septon Bennet, we have had no one to hear confession."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“最近尸体太多了，”长老叹气，“掘墓人都没休息过。三河人，西境人，北方佬，全冲到了这里。有骑士也有无赖。我们将他们埋在一起，史塔克与兰尼斯特，布莱克伍德与布雷肯，佛雷与戴瑞…统统在一起，这是河流交给我们的责任，以回报它的丰厚馈赠，我们尽力而为，然而有时候找到女人…有时更糟，找到小孩。那是最为残酷的礼物。”他转向梅里巴德修士。“我希望你有时间为我们告解。自土匪杀死老贝内特修士之后，我们就没入听取忏悔了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

It fell to me to treat some of the survivors. The fisherfolk brought them across the bay to me after the flames had gone out and they deemed it safe to land. One poor woman had been raped a dozen times, and her breasts… my lady, you wear man's mail, so I shall not spare you these horrors… her breasts had been torn and chewed and eaten, as if by some… cruel beast. I did what I could for her, though that was little enough. As she lay dying, her worst curses were not for the men who had raped her, nor the monster who devoured her living flesh, but for Ser Quincy Cox, who barred his gates when the outlaws entered the town and sat safe behind stone walls as his people screamed and died."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Ser Quincy is an old man," said Septon Meribald gently. "His sons and good-sons are far away or dead, his grandsons are still boys, and he has two daughters. What could he have done, one man against so many?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“昆西爵士是个老人，”梅里巴德修士轻柔地说，“他的儿子和养子不是远在他乡就是已经死去，他的孙子们还小，他还有两个女儿。凭一己之力又怎么对付得了那么多歹徒呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>

I am glad that you are here to give it. I could not." He put aside the driftwood cup, and stood. "The supper bell will sound soon. My friends, will you come with me to the sept, to pray for the souls of the good folk of Saltpans before we sit down to break bread and share some meat and mead?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Their supper in the septry was as strange a meal as Brienne had ever eaten, though not at all unpleasant. The food was plain, but very good; there were loaves of crusty bread still warm from the ovens, crocks of fresh-churned butter, honey from the septry's hives, and a thick stew of crabs, mussels, and at least three different kinds of fish. Septon Meribald and Ser Hyle drank the mead the brothers made, and pronounced it excellent, whilst she and Podrick contented themselves with more sweet cider. Nor was the meal a somber one. Meribald pronounced a prayer before the food was served, and whilst the brothers ate at four long trestle tables, one of their number played for them on the high harp, filling the hall with soft sweet sounds. When the Elder Brother excused the musician to take his own meal, Brother Narbert and another proctor took turns reading from The Seven-Pointed Star.</div>

<div class="line_en">By the time the readings were completed, the last of the food had been cleared away by the novices whose task it was to serve. Most were boys near Podrick's age, or younger, but there were grown men as well, amongst them the big gravedigger they had encountered on the hill, who walked with the awkward lurching gait of one half-crippled. As the hall emptied, the Elder Brother asked Narbert to show Podrick and Ser Hyle to their pallets in the cloisters. "You will not mind sharing a cell, I hope? It is not large, but you will find it comfortable."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="诵读结束之后，最后一点食物已被担当侍者的学徒们清理干净。他们大多跟波德瑞克年龄相仿，或者更小，但也有成年人，他们在山坡上遇到的大个子掘墓人便在其中，他笨拙地迈着一瘸一拐的步伐。大厅逐渐空旷，长老让纳伯特带波德瑞克和海尔爵士去回廊里的床铺。“你们不介意共用一间房吧？不大，但挺舒适。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Only the castle remains. Even the fisherfolk are gone, the fortunate few who were out on the water when the raiders came. They watched their houses burn and listened to screams and cries float across the harbor, too fearful to land their boats. When at last they came ashore, it was to bury friends and kin. What is there for them at Saltpans now but bones and bitter memories? They have moved to Maidenpool or other towns." He gestured with the lantern, and they resumed their descent. "Saltpans was never an important port, but ships did call there from time to time. That was what the raiders wanted, a galley or a cog to carry them across the narrow sea. When none was at hand, they took their rage and desperation out upon the townsfolk. I wonder, my lady… what do you hope to find there?"</div>

It was colder here than on the sheltered side, and wilder. The hill was steeper, and the path meandered back and forth through weeds and briars, wind-carved rocks, and twisted, thorny trees that clung tenaciously to the stony hillside. The Elder Brother brought a lantern to light their way down. At one turn he paused. "On a clear night you could see the fires of Saltpans from here. Across the bay, just there." He pointed.</div>

They looked like beehives made of stone, low and rounded, windowless. "This one," he said, indicating the nearest cottage, the only one with smoke rising from the smokehole in the center of its roof. Brienne had to duck when entering to keep from banging her head against the lintel. Inside she found a dirt floor, a straw pallet, furs and blankets to keep her warm, a basin of water, a flagon of cider, some bread and cheese, a small fire, and two low chairs. The Elder Brother sat in one, and put the lantern down. "May I stay a while? I feel that we should talk."</div>

He drank, to drown his pain in a sea of wine. He did not love, nor was he loved himself. It was hate that drove him. Though he committed many sins, he never sought forgiveness. Where other men dream of love, or wealth, or glory, this man Sandor Clegane dreamed of slaying his own brother, a sin so terrible it makes me shudder just to speak of it. Yet that was the bread that nourished him, the fuel that kept his fires burning. Ignoble as it was, the hope of seeing his brother's blood upon his blade was all this sad and angry creature lived for… and even that was taken from him, when Prince Oberyn of Dorne stabbed Ser Gregor with a poisoned spear."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我对桑铎·克里冈此人略知一二。多年他来一直担任乔佛里王子的贴身护卫，即便在这儿，也能听说他的故事，其中有好也有坏，而即使我们听说的只有一半真实，这也是一个苦难而饱受折磨的灵魂，一个嘲笑着诸神同时也嘲笑人类的罪人。他忠诚效力，却感受不到由此带来的自豪；他努力战斗，但胜利中没有喜悦；他饮酒如水，企图淹没感受；他没有爱，也不爱自己，驱使他的是仇恨。他虽犯下许多罪孽，却从不寻求宽恕。其他人梦想爱情、财富和荣耀，而这个人，桑铎克里冈梦想着杀死自己的兄长，这是如此可怕的念头，单单说出来就令我战栗。然而那是滋养他的面包，那是让他生命之火继续焚烧的燃料，他期望看到哥哥的血染在自己的剑上，这悲哀而充满愤怒的生灵为此而活着…然而现在连这点希望也被夺走了，多恩的奥柏伦亲王以一根毒矛刺穿了格雷果爵士。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I did. You would have pitied him as well, if you had seen him at the end. I came upon him by the Trident, drawn by his cries of pain. He begged me for the gift of mercy, but I am sworn not to kill again. Instead, I bathed his fevered brow with river water, and gave him wine to drink and a poultice for his wound, but my efforts were too little and too late. The Hound died there, in my arms. You may have seen a big black stallion in our stables. That was his warhorse, Stranger. A blasphemous name. We prefer to call him Driftwood, as he was found beside the river. I fear he has his former master's nature."</div>

<div class="line_en">"I never chose it. My father was a knight, and his before him. So were my brothers, every one. I was trained for battle since the day they deemed me old enough to hold a wooden sword. I saw my share of them, and did not disgrace myself. I had women too, and there I did disgrace myself, for some I took by force. There was a girl I wished to marry, the younger daughter of a petty lord, but I was my father's thirdborn son and had neither land nor wealth to offer her… only a sword, a horse, a shield. All in all, I was a sad man. When I was not fighting, I was drunk. My life was writ in red, in blood and wine."</div>

<div class="line_en">"When I died in the Battle of the Trident. I fought for Prince Rhaegar, though he never knew my name. I could not tell you why, save that the lord I served served a lord who served a lord who had decided to support the dragon rather than the stag. Had he decided elsewise, I might have been on the other side of the river. The battle was a bloody thing. The singers would have us believe it was all Rhaegar and Robert struggling in the stream for a woman both of them claimed to love, but I assure you, other men were fighting too, and I was one. I took an arrow through the thigh and another through the foot, and my horse was killed from under me, yet I fought on. I can still remember how desperate I was to find another horse, for I had no coin to buy one, and without a horse I would no longer be a knight. That was all that I was thinking of, if truth be told. I never saw the blow that felled me. I heard hooves behind my back and thought, a horse! but before I could turn something slammed into my head and knocked me back into the river, where by rights I should have drowned.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当我死于三叉戟河之战时。我为雷加王子战斗，尽管他从不知道我的名字，这很正常，我侍奉的领主侍奉另一个领主，而这另一个领主决定支持龙而非鹿。假如他作出相反的决定，我也许就站在河的另一边。战斗血腥残酷。歌手们总是让人们相信，在河中苦斗的只有雷加和劳勃，为了一个他们同时爱上的女人，但我向你保证，其他人也在奋战，我就是其中之一。我大腿中箭，另一支箭射中了脚，胯下的马也被杀死，然而我继续战斗。我记得当时不顾一切想要再找一匹马，因为我没钱买，若没有马，就不再是骑士。老实说，我所想的只有这个，根本没看见将我打倒的那一击。我听见背后有马蹄声，于是心想，一匹马！但还没来得及转身，脑袋就给砸了一下，被打落到河里，按理应该淹死。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Instead I woke here, upon the Quiet Isle. The Elder Brother told me I had washed up on the tide, naked as my name day. I can only think that someone found me in the shallows, stripped me of my armor, boots, and breeches, and pushed me back out into the deeper water. The river did the rest. We are all born naked, so I suppose it was only fitting that I come into my second life the same way. I spent the next ten years in silence."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Do you?" He leaned forward, his big hands on his knees. "If so, give up this quest of yours. The Hound is dead, and in any case he never had your Sansa Stark. As for this beast who wears his helm, he will be found and hanged. The wars are ending, and these outlaws cannot survive the peace. Randyll Tarly is hunting them from Maidenpool and Walder Frey from the Twins, and there is a new young lord in Darry, a pious man who will surely set his lands to rights. Go home, child. You have a home, which is more than many can say in these dark days. You have a noble father who must surely love you. Consider his grief if you should never return. Perhaps they will bring your sword and shield to him, after you have fallen. Perhaps he will even hang them in his hall and look on them with pride… but if you were to ask him, I know he would tell you that he would sooner have a living daughter than a shattered shield."</div>

I am the only child the gods let him keep. The freakish one, not fit to be a son or daughter." All of it came pouring out of Brienne then, like black blood from a wound; the betrayals and betrothals, Red Ronnet and his rose, Lord Renly dancing with her, the wager for her maidenhead, the bitter tears she shed the night her king wed Margaery Tyrell, the mêlée at Bitterbridge, the rainbow cloak that she had been so proud of, the shadow in the king's pavilion, Renly dying in her arms, Riverrun and Lady Catelyn, the voyage down the Trident, dueling Jaime in the woods, the Bloody Mummers, Jaime crying "Sapphires," Jaime in the tub at Harrenhal with steam rising from his body, the taste of Vargo Hoat's blood when she bit down on his ear, the bear pit, Jaime leaping down onto the sand, the long ride to King's Landing, Sansa Stark, the vow she'd sworn to Jaime, the vow she'd sworn to Lady Catelyn, Oathkeeper, Duskendale, Maidenpool, Nimble Dick and Crackclaw and the Whispers, the men she'd killed…</div>
