<div class="line_en">But his son hated him. He hated him for coming up to them, for stopping and looking down on them; he hated him for interrupting them; he hated him for the exaltation and sublimity of his gestures; for the magnificence of his head; for his exactingness and egotism (for there he stood, commanding them to attend to him) but most of all he hated the twang and twitter of his father's emotion which, vibrating round them, disturbed the perfect simplicity and good sense of his relations with his mother. By looking fixedly at the page, he hoped to make him move on; by pointing his finger at a word, he hoped to recall his mother's attention, which, he knew angrily, wavered instantly his father stopped. But, no. Nothing would make Mr Ramsay move on. There he stood, demanding sympathy.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mrs Ramsay, who had been sitting loosely, folding her son in her arm, braced herself, and, half turning, seemed to raise herself with an effort, and at once to pour erect into the air a rain of energy, a column of spray, looking at the same time animated and alive as if all her energies were being fused into force, burning and illuminating (quietly though she sat, taking up her stocking again), and into this delicious fecundity, this fountain and spray of life, the fatal sterility of the male plunged itself, like a beak of brass, barren and bare. He wanted sympathy. He was a failure, he said. Mrs Ramsay flashed her needles. Mr Ramsay repeated, never taking his eyes from her face, that he was a failure. She blew the words back at him. "Charles Tansley…" she said. But he must have more than that. It was sympathy he wanted, to be assured of his genius, first of all, and then to be taken within the circle of life, warmed and soothed, to have his senses restored to him, his barrenness made furtile, and all the rooms of the house made full of life -- the drawing-room; behind the drawing-room the kitchen; above the kitchen the bedrooms; and beyond them the nurseries; they must be furnished, they must be filled with life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一直搂着儿子随随便便坐着的拉姆齐夫人这时打起精神，半转过身子，似乎要用力站起来，立刻一阵活力雨点般向空中直喷而出，一根水雾之柱，同时她显得生气勃勃充满活力，仿佛她全部的精力都凝聚成了力量，在燃烧，在发光（尽管她仍安静地坐着，又拿起了织着的袜子），那个命中注定没有生机的男人一头扎进了这美妙丰饶的生命之喷泉和水雾之中，像一只黄铜鸟嘴，光秃贫瘠。他需要同情。他是个失败者，他说。拉姆齐夫人闪动着钢针。拉姆齐先生又说了一遍，眼睛—直没有离开她的脸，他是个失败者。她堵回他的话，“查尔斯·坦斯利……”她说道。但是对他来说这还不够。他需要的是同情，首先需要他的天才得到确信，然后接纳他进入生活之圈，使他得到温暖和安慰，使他的感觉得到恢复，使他的贫乏空虚变得丰饶富足，使宅子里的每一个房间都充满勃勃生机——客厅；客厅后面的厨房；厨房上面的卧室；卧室再过去的育儿室；一定要用家具把它们布置起来，—定要它们充满生机。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He was a failure, he repeated. Well, look then, feel then. Flashing her needles, glancing round about her, out of the window, into the room, at James himself, she assured him, beyond a shadow of a doubt, by her laugh, her poise, her competence (as a nurse carrying a light across a dark room assures a fractious child), that it was real; the house was full; the garden blowing. If he put implicit faith in her, nothing should hurt him; however deep he buried himself or climed high, not for a second should he find himself without her. So boasting of her capacity to surround and protect, there was scarcely a shell of herself left for her to know herself by; all was so lavished and spent; and James, as he stood stiff between her knees, felt her rise in a rosy-flowered fruit tree laid with leaves and dancing boughs into which the beak of brass, the arid scimitar of his father, the egotistical man, plunged and smote, demanding sympathy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他是个失败者，他重复道。好吧，那你看一看，感觉一下吧。她闪动着钢针，环顾四周，看看窗外，看看室内，看看詹姆斯，她用她的笑声、她的沉着自信的姿态、她的胜任一切的能力使他毫不怀疑地确信这是真的（正像一个拿着盏灯穿过一间黑屋子的保姆让一个犟孩子放心一样）；宅子里丰富充足；花园中鲜花盛开。如果他对她绝对信任，就没有什么能伤害他；无论他把自己埋得多深或爬得多高，也没有一刻会发现她不在自己身边。她对自己包围保护别人的能力是如此自豪，因而简直没有给自己留下一个能使她了解自己的躯壳；一切都毫不吝惜给掉了，用尽了；而当詹姆斯直挺挺地站在她双膝之间时，感觉到她上升成了一棵枝繁叶茂、开满红花的果树，被那个黄铜鸟嘴，那个自我中心的男人（他的父亲）的那把生气全无的短弯刀冲进去猛击。要求得到同情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Charles Tansley thought him the greatest metaphysician of the time, she said. But he must have more than that. He must have sympathy. He must be assured that he too lived in the heart of life; was needed; not only here, but all over the world. Flashing her needles, confident, upright, she created drawing-room and kitchen, set them all aglow; bade him take his ease there, go in and out, enjoy himself. She laughed, she knitted. Standing between her knees, very stiff, James felt all her strength flaring up to be drunk and quenched by the beak of brass, the arid scimitar of the male, which smote mercilessly, again and again, demanding sympathy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="查尔斯·坦斯利认为他是当代最伟大的玄学家，她说道。但是对他来说这还不够。他必需得到同情。必需使他确信他也处身于生活的中心；人们需要他；不仅在这里，而且在世界各处都需要他。她闪动着钢针，自信，坦然，她把客厅和厨房创造得光彩夺目；让他在那里自在安心，进进出出，过得快活。她笑，她织袜子。詹姆斯直挺挺地站在她双膝之间，感觉到她所有的力量都突然进发出来，被那个黄铜鸟嘴吸吮、压制，被男人那把生气全无的短弯刀一次再一次地无情猛击，要求得到同情。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Immediately, Mrs Ramsey seemed to fold herself together, one petal closed in another, and the whole fabric fell in exhaustion upon itself, so that she had only strength enough to move her finger, in exquisite abandonment to exhaustion, across the page of Grimm's fairy story, while there throbbed through her, like a pulse in a spring which has expanded to its full width and now gently ceases to beat, the rapture of successful creation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="立刻，拉姆齐夫人似乎把自己合拢了起来，花瓣一片叠着一片地合上，整个架子筋疲力尽地塌了下来，于是她听任极度疲乏的摆布。只剩下把手指在格林童话的书页上移动的力气；同时在她体内跳动着创造成功的狂喜，如同泉水的涌动，在扩展到了极点后现在慢慢停止了搏动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Filled with her words, like a child who drops off satisfied, he said, at last, looking at her with humble gratitude, restored, renewed, that he would take a turn; he would watch the children playing cricket. He went.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他脑袋里装满了她的话，像一个心满意足地睡着了的小孩，终于恢复了信心，重新振作起来，怀着谦恭的感激之情看着她，说他要去转上一圈；他要去看孩子们打板球。他走开了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Every throb of this pulse seemed, as he walked away, to enclose her and her husband, and to give to each that solace which two different notes, one high, one low, struck together, seem to give each other as they combine. Yet as the resonance died, and she turned to the Fairy Tale again, Mrs Ramsey felt not only exhausted in body (afterwards, not at the time, she always felt this) but also there tinged her physical fatigue some faintly disagreeable sensation with another origin. Not that, as she read aloud the story of the Fisherman's Wife, she knew precisely what it came from; nor did she let herself put into words her dissatisfaction when she realized, at the turn of the page when she stopped and heard dully, ominously, a wave fall, how it came from this: she did not like, even for a second, to feel finer than her husband; and further, could not bear not being entirely sure, when she spoke to him, of the truth of what she said. Universities and people wanting him, lectures and books and their being of the highest importance -- all that she did not doubt for a moment; but it was their relation, and his coming to her like that, openly, so that any one could see, that discomposed her; for then people said he depended on her, when they must know that of the two he was infinitely the more important, and what she gave the world, in comparison with what he gave, negligable. But then again, it was the other thing too -- not being able to tell him the truth, being afraid, for instance, about the greenhouse roof and the expense it would be, fifty pounds perhaps to mend it; and then about his books, to be afraid that he might guess, what she a little suspected, that his last book was not quite his best book (she gathered that from William Bankes); and then to hide small daily things, and the children seeing it, and the burden it laid on them -- all this diminished the entire joy, the pure joy, of the two notes sounding together, and let the sound die on her ear now with a dismal flatness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在他走开去的时候，这一涌动中的每一次跳动似乎都把她和丈夫包围于其中，使他们给对方以安慰，像同时奏出一高一低的两个不同音将结合起来时所能互相给予的那样。然而，当回响着的共鸣消失，她又回到童话故事的时候，拉姆齐夫人不仅感到身体的疲乏（她总是在后来、而不是当时，有这种感觉），而且在肉体的疲乏中还夹杂着出自另外原因的微微令人不快的感觉。在她朗读渔夫老婆的故事时，她并不确切地知道这感觉来自何处；当她翻页停止朗读、听到海浪落下时那沉闷不祥的声音、意识到它的来源时，她也没有让自己用语言把不满表达出来：她不愿意感到自己比丈夫强，即使是一秒钟也不行；而且在对他说话时如果不能肯定自己说的都是事实。她是无法忍受的。大学和人们需要他，讲课、著作以及它们具有头等重要的意义——这—切她从不怀疑；但是，使她烦恼不安的是他们两人之间的关系，他这样公开地到她这儿来求助，搞得尽人皆知；因为这样一来人们就会说他依赖于她，而实际上他们应该知道，在他们两个人之中他绝对重要得多，比起他对世界的贡献，她的贡献是微不足道的。不过也还有着另一点——由于害怕不能够告诉他真相，比如说，关于温室的顶和修理所需费用，可能得五十镑左右；还有关于他的著作，她怕他会猜到他最近出的那本书并不是他写的最好的一本，她本来就有点疑心是这么回事（她是从威廉·班克斯处得到的印象）；还有需要隐瞒一些日常小事，以及孩子们看到这一切给他们造成的负担——所有这些都削弱了两个音将在一起奏出时那完整的欢乐、纯粹的欢乐，使这声音凄凉单调地在她耳际消失。">查看中文翻译</div>

It was Augustus Carmichael shuffling past, precisely now, at the very moment when it was painful to be reminded of the inadequacy of human relationships, that the most perfect was flawed, and could not bear the examination which, loving her husband, with her instinct for truth, she turned upon it; when it was painful to feel herself convicted of unworthiness, and impeded in her proper function by these lies, these exaggerations,-- it was at this moment when she was fretted thus ignobly in the wake of her exaltation, that Mr Carmichael shuffled past, in his yellow slippers, and some demon in her made it necessary for her to call out, as he passed,</div>
