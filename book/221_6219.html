<div class="line_en">I didn't sleep that night. I lay awake in the little box room, gazing up at the ceiling and carefully reconstructing the last two months based on what I now knew. It was as if everything had shifted, fragmented and settled in some other place, into a pattern I barely recognized.</div>

<div class="line_en">I felt duped, the dim-witted accessory who hadn't known what was going on. I felt they must have laughed privately at my attempts to feed Will vegetables, or cut his hair -- little things to make him feel better. What had been the point, after all?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我感觉自己被骗了，在什么都不知道的情况下就傻傻地做了帮凶。我想他们私下里肯定嘲笑我，还费尽心思地给威尔喂蔬菜，给他理发——做所有让他舒服些的小事。可是这些又有什么意义呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I ran over and over the conversation I had heard, trying to interpret it in some alternative way, trying to convince myself that I had misunderstood what they had said. But Dignitas wasn't exactly somewhere you went for a mini-break. I couldn't believe Camilla Traynor could contemplate doing that to her son. Yes, I had thought her cold, and yes, awkward around him. It was hard to imagine her cuddling him, as my mother had cuddled us -- fiercely, joyously -- until we wriggled away, begging to be let go. If I'm honest, I just thought it was how the upper classes were with their children. I had just read Will's copy of Love in a Cold Climate, after all. But to actively, to voluntarily play a part in her own son's death?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我一遍又一遍地回想听来的话，想为它找到另外的解释，想说服自己我误会她们的意思了，但是“尊严”并不是一个用来度短假的地方。我不能相信卡米拉•特雷纳会考虑对她儿子做那件事。是的，我觉得她冷漠。是的，她跟他有别扭。很难想象她搂抱他，会像母亲抱我们那样热烈愉快，直到我们挣脱开来，请求她松手。老实说，我原以为那是上流社会的人们对待自己孩子的方式。毕竟我刚读了威尔借给我的书——《恋恋冬季》[22]。但是她会主动积极地在儿子的死亡中自愿扮演一个角色吗？ 注：[22]英国作家南西·米佛（Nancy Mitford，1904～1973）的小说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I couldn't tell anyone. That was almost the worst bit. I was now complicit in the Traynors' secret. Sick and listless, I rang Patrick to say I wasn't feeling well and was going to stay home. No problem, he was doing a 10k, he said. He probably wouldn't be through at the athletics club until after nine anyway. I'd see him on Saturday. He sounded distracted, as if his mind were already elsewhere, further along some mythical track.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我不能告诉任何人，这是最糟糕的一点。我现在与特雷纳夫人在一条船上。忧心忡忡又虚弱无力，我给帕特里克打电话，告诉他我不太舒服，要待在家里。没问题，他现在正忙，他说。他在运动俱乐部至少要待到九点以后。我周六才能见他。他听起来心不在焉，好像正在想别的事情，也许是沿着虚构中的线路飞奔。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">With hindsight her behaviour seemed even colder, her actions imbued with some sinister intent. I was angry with her and angry with Will. Angry with them for letting me engage in a facade. I was angry for all the times I had sat and thought about how to make things better for him, how to make him comfortable, or happy. When I was not angry, I was sad. I would recall the slight break in her voice as she tried to comfort Georgina, and feel a great sadness for her. She was, I knew, in an impossible position.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="事后想来，她的行为似乎冷酷至极，充满恶意。我生她的气，也生威尔的气。我气愤的是，他们制造一场假象来骗我。有多少次我坐下来沉思怎样把事情做得更好，怎样让他舒适和开心，我为此感到愤怒。气消时，我又难过起来。我想起她试图安慰乔治娜时语气中的不忍，又为她感到痛心。我知道，她也无能为力。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But mostly I felt filled with horror. I was haunted by what I now knew. How could you live each day knowing that you were simply whiling away the days until your own death? How could this man whose skin I had felt that morning under my fingers -- warm, and alive -- choose to just extinguish himself? How could it be that, with everyone's consent, in six months' time that same skin would be decaying under the ground?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但我主要还是恐惧，我所知道的一切成为我无法摆脱的困扰。知道你仅仅是一日日消磨着死亡前的日子，你怎么还过得下去？这个男人，那天早上他的身体在我的手指下，温暖而有活力，怎么会选择结束自己的生命？他怎么能得到大家的一致同意，不到六个月的时间这具身体会在地底等待腐朽？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I refused supper. I lay in bed until my thoughts darkened and solidified to the point where I couldn't bear the weight of them, and at eight thirty I came back downstairs and sat silently watching television, perched on the other side of Granddad, who was the only person in our family guaranteed not to ask me a question. He sat in his favourite armchair and stared at the screen with glassy-eyed intensity. I was never sure whether he was watching, or whether his mind was somewhere else entirely.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我没有吃晚饭。我躺在床上，直到我的思绪混乱到我再也承受不住。八点半时我走下楼，坐在外祖父的另一边，一声不吭地看电视。外祖父是这个家绝不会问我问题的人。他坐在他最喜欢的扶手椅里，出神地凝视着屏幕。我从不确定他是否在看电视，兴许他的心思早就飞向了别处。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I saw the way she glanced at Dad.

I knew they would blame themselves for encouraging me to take the job.</div>

<div class="line_en">I spent the short bus ride trying to work out what I was going to tell my parents. They would be furious that I had left what they would see as a perfectly suitable and well-paid job. After her initial shock my mother would look pained and defend me, suggesting that it had all been too much. My father would probably ask why I couldn't be more like my sister. He often did, even though I was not the one who ruined her life by getting pregnant and having to rely on the rest of the family for financial support and babysitting. You weren't allowed to say anything like that in our house because, according to my mother, it was like implying that Thomas wasn't a blessing. And all babies were God's blessing, even those who said bugger quite a lot, and whose presence meant that half the potential wage earners in our family couldn't actually go and get a decent job.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="公共汽车上短暂的路程中，我一直在想该怎么跟我父母说。辞掉一份他们眼中称心如意又高薪的工作，他们肯定会大发雷霆。最初的震惊过后，母亲会面露难色，为我辩护，说他们这么做太过分了。父亲大概会问为什么我不能像我妹妹一些。他总是这么说，即使因为怀孕而毁掉自己的生活，还要依靠家里人提供经济援助和帮忙照看婴儿的人不是我。在我们家，你不能说那样的话，因为，按照母亲的观点，那样就像在暗示托马斯不是一个恩赐。但每一个孩子都是上帝的恩赐，即便是这些老说“浑蛋”的孩子，即便他的存在意味着我们家里一半可以挣工资的人，不能真正去做一份体面的工作。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I slammed the door in my sister's face. And when I finally heard her walking slowly back down the stairs, I chose not to think about what she would say to my parents, about the way they would all treat this as further evidence of my catastrophic inability to do anything of any worth. I chose not to think about Syed at the Job Centre and how I would explain my reasons for leaving this most well paid of menial jobs. I chose not to think about the chicken factory and how somewhere, deep within its bowels, there was probably a set of plastic overalls, and a hygiene cap with my name still on it.</div>

<div class="line_en">I lay back and I thought about Will. I thought about his anger and his sadness. I thought about what his mother had said -- that I was one of the only people able to get through to him. I thought about him trying not to laugh at the "Molahonkey Song" on a night when the snow drifted gold past the window. I thought about the warm skin and soft hair and hands of someone living, someone who was far cleverer and funnier than I would ever be and who still couldn't see a better future than to obliterate himself. And finally, my head pressed into the pillow, I cried, because my life suddenly seemed so much darker and more complicated than I could ever have imagined, and I wished I could go back, back to when my biggest worry was whether Frank and I had ordered in enough Chelsea buns.</div>

I hated her for the fact that she got thick, straight hair, while mine breaks off if it grows beyond my shoulders. I hated her for the fact that you can never tell her anything that she doesn't already know. I hated the fact that for my whole school career teachers insisted on telling me in hushed tones how bright she was, as if her brilliance wouldn't mean that by default I lived in a permanent shadow. I hated her for the fact that at the age of twenty-six I lived in a box room in a semi-detached house just so she could have her illegitimate son in with her in the bigger bedroom. But every now and then I was very glad indeed that she was my sister.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在很多方面我都不喜欢我妹妹。几年前，我可能会向你展示就这个话题我潦草地写下的数张单子。我讨厌她有浓密的直发，而我的头发只要一长过肩就断了。我讨厌她什么都知道。我讨厌在我整个求学生涯中，老师们一直用肃静的语气告诉我，她有多聪明，好像她的聪明并不意味着我生活在永远的阴影中。我讨厌她，因为在我二十六岁的年纪，我住在半独立式房屋的储藏室里，就为了让她能跟她的私生子一起住在大些的卧室里。但时不时地我还是打心眼儿里为有她做妹妹感到高兴。">查看中文翻译</div>
