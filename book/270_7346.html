<div class="line_en">I felt oddly buoyant as I walked from spanish toward the cafeteria, and it wasn't just because I was holding hands with the most perfect person on the planet, though that was certainly part of it.</div>

<div class="line_en">Or maybe it wasn't anything to do with me specifically. Maybe it was the atmosphere of freedom that hung over the entire campus. School was winding down, and, for the senior class especially, there was a perceptible thrill in the air.</div>

<div class="line_en">Freedom was so close it was touchable, taste-able. Signs of it were everywhere. Posters crowded together on the cafeteria walls, and the trashcans wore a colorful skirt of spilled-over fliers: reminders to buy yearbooks, class rings, and announcements; deadlines to order graduation gowns, hats, and tassels; neon-bright sales pitches -- the juniors campaigning for class office; ominous, rose-wreathed advertisements for this year's prom. The big dance was this coming weekend, but I had an ironclad promise from Edward that I would not be subjected to that again. After all, I'd already had that human experience.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="自由如此接近，到处都是它的信号，简直可以触摸得到了，品尝得到了。食堂的墙壁上贴满了海报，垃圾桶上披着一层漫溢出来的广告传单：买年鉴的提示，班级竞赛和通知；预订毕业礼服、帽子和流苏的截止日期；霓虹般闪亮的促销传单——二年级学生竞争班委会；散发着不祥的预兆的今年正式舞会的玫瑰花环广告。大舞会就在这个周末，但是我跟爱德华约定好决不再做这样的事情。毕竟，我已经有过这样的人类经验了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Alice and Ben were already there, too, on either side of Angela. Ben was intent over a comic book, his glasses sliding down his narrow nose. Alice was scrutinizing my boring jeans-and-a-t-shirt outfit in a way that made me self-conscious. Probably plotting another makeover. I sighed. My indifferent attitude to fashion was a constant thorn in her side. If I'd allow it, she'd love to dress me every day -- perhaps several times a day -- like some oversized three-dimensional paper doll.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱丽丝和本也已经坐在那里了，他们分别坐在安吉拉的两侧。本专注地读着一本笑话书，他的眼镜从窄窄的鼻梁上滑落下来。而爱丽丝则打量着我令人厌倦的牛仔裤与T恤的搭配，她的眼神让我感到有些神经过敏。或许她正在构思另一个改头换面的计划呢，我叹了叹气。我对时尚的漠然态度在她看来就像一根刺儿一样，要是我允许的话，她会每天为我打扮——说不定每天好几次——就像我是超大的立体纸玩偶一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">No, it must be my personal freedom that lightened me today. The ending of the school year did not give me the pleasure it seemed to give the other students. Actually, I felt nervous to the point of nausea whenever I thought of it. I tried to not think of it.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Have you sent your announcements, yet?" Angela asked when Edward and I sat down at our table. She had her light brown hair pulled back into a sloppy ponytail instead of her usual smooth hairdo, and there was a slightly frantic look about her eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你发出通知了吗？”我和爱德华在餐桌边坐下来的时候，安吉拉问道。她把淡棕色的头发梳到脑后扎成一个马尾辫了，一改她平时的发型，而且她的眼中闪烁着些许焦急的神色。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Angela and Alice started talking about options; Ben joined the conversation, setting his comics aside. My attention drifted. I was surprised to find that the subject of my freedom was suddenly not as gratifying as it had been just a moment ago. While they discussed things to do in Port Angeles or maybe Hoquiam, I began to feel disgruntled.</div>

<div class="line_en">Angela's voice yanked me from my reverie. She was waving her hand back and forth in front of Alice's blank, staring face. Alice's expression was something I recognized -- an expression that sent an automatic shock of panic through my body. The vacant look in her eyes told me that she was seeing something very different from the mundane lunchroom scene that surrounded us, but something that was every bit as real in its own way. Something that was coming, something that would happen soon. I felt the blood slither from my face.</div>

Though I suppose, for Mike's car, you'll do. It's only within the finer tunings of a good Italian sports car that you're out of your depth.

What had Alice seen today at lunch? Something he didn't want to tell me, and I tried to think of a reason why he would keep secrets. Maybe it would be better to prepare myself before I asked. I didn't want to freak out and have him think I couldn't handle it, whatever it was.</div>

<div class="line_en">My imagination was sadly out of control. I'd taken a perfectly normal afternoon and twisted it until it looked like Edward was going out of his way to keep things from me. I needed therapy.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh." That was nothing close to what I'd been expecting. But of course it made sense that Alice would be watching out for Jasper's future. He was her soul mate, her true other half, though they weren't as flamboyant about their relationship as Rosalie and Emmett were. "Why didn't you tell me before?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦。”这和我所期待的相去甚远，不过，爱丽丝当然会关注贾斯帕的未来。他是她的精神伴侣，她真实的另一半，尽管他们俩并没有像罗莎莉和埃美特那样炫耀他们的关系，“为什么你不早些告诉我？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We went downstairs to work on our homework, just in case Charlie showed up early. Edward finished in minutes; I slogged laboriously through my calculus until I decided it was time to fix Charlie's dinner. Edward helped, making faces every so often at the raw ingredients -- human food was mildly repulsive to him. I made stroganoff from Grandma Swan's recipe, because I was sucking up. It wasn't one of my favorites, but it would please Charlie.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们下楼去做作业，以防查理早回来。爱德华没几分钟就做完了，我缓慢艰难地做着微积分作业，直到我决定要给查理做晚餐了。爱德华在一边帮忙，过于频繁地看着我的原材料做鬼脸——人类的食物对他而言有些恶心。我照着斯旺祖母的秘方做了一道酸奶油蘑菇肉汤，因为我要拍马屁了。这不是我最喜欢的菜，但是这会令查理高兴的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Huh," was my genius response. But what could I say? I knew I wouldn't be allowed to hit a werewolf party, even with parental supervision.

I don't know how long I stood there weighing the pros against the cons -- doing the right thing by Jacob, seeing my closest friend again, being a good person, versus making Edward furious with me.
