<div class="line_en">The rest of our journey was very easy, and the next evening we reached the house of our master's friend, where a groom took us to a comfortable stable. We stayed two or three days, then returned home. John was glad to see us, and we were glad to see him.</div>

<div class="line_en">The master was waiting at the Hall door with a letter in his hand. "Ride for your life, John!" he said. "Give this to Dr White, then rest your horse and be back as soon as you can. Mrs Gordon is very ill."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="主人在大宅门口等着，手里拿着一封信。“拼命跑，约翰！”他说。“把这封信交给怀特大夫，让马歇歇，然后再尽快赶回来。太太病得很厉害。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Away went John and I, through the Park, through the village, and down the hill. There was a long piece of flat road by the riverside, and John said, "Now Beauty, do your best!" I needed no whip, and for two miles I galloped as fast as I could-perhaps even faster than my grandfather, who won the race at Newrmarket. When we came to the bridge, John slowed me down a little and patted my neck. "Well done, Beauty!" he said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我和约翰冲了出来，穿过庄园，穿过村子，冲下山去。河边的一长段路很平坦，约翰说：“现在，黑骏马，你尽力吧！”我不需鞭打，尽我所能飞奔了2英里——也许比我那得了纽马克特赛马冠军的爷爷跑得还快。当我们来到桥边时，约翰让我稍微放慢速度，拍着我的脖子说：“真不错，黑骏马！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Wake up, Beauty!" he said, coming into the stable. "We must go quickly now!" And before I could think, he had the saddle on my back and the bridle on my head.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then I was off again, as fast as before. The air was cold and the moon was bright, and it was a pleasant night. We went through a village, then a dark wood, then uphill, then downhill, and after twelve kilometres, we came to the town.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我又跑了起来，和刚才一样快。空气寒冷，月光皎洁，这是一个令人愉快的夜晚。我们穿过了一个村子，然后是一片黑黢黢的林子，然后上山、下山，跑了12公里后，我们进了城。">查看中文翻译</div>
