<div class="line_en">The death of Guiliano crushed the spirit of the people of Sicily. He had been their champion, their shield against the rich and the nobility, the Friends of the Friends, the Christian Democratic government in Rome. With Guiliano gone, Don Croce Malo put the island of Sicily through his olive press and squeezed out an immense fortune from rich and poor alike. When the government tried to build dams to provide cheap water, Don Croce had heavy equipment for building dams blown up. After all, he controlled all the water wells in Sicily; dams supplying cheap water were not to his interest. With the postwar boom in building Don Croce's inside information and persuasive negotiation style procured the best building sites at a cheap price; he sold dear. He took under his personal protection all the businesses of Sicily. You could not sell an artichoke in Palermo's market stalls without paying Don Croce a few centesimi; the rich could not buy jewels for their wives or racing horses for their sons without taking out insurance with Don Croce. And with a firm hand he discouraged all the foolish hopes of peasants who wished to claim uncultivated land from the estate of Prince Ollorto, because of nonsensical laws passed by the Italian Parliament. Squeezed between Don Croce, the nobles and the government in Rome, the Sicilian people gave up hope.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the two years after Guiliano's death, five hundred thousand Sicilians, most of them young males, emigrated. They went to England and became gardeners, makers of ice cream, waiters in restaurants. They went to Germany and did heavy manual labor, to Switzerland to keep that country clean and build cuckoo clocks. They went to France as kitchen helpers and sweepers in garment houses. They went to Brazil to hack out clearings in the forest. Some went to the cold winters of Scandinavia. And of course there were the fortunate few recruited by Clemenza to serve in the Corleone Family in the United States. These were considered the luckiest of all. And so Sicily became a land of old men, young children and women who were widows by economic vendetta. The stone villages no longer supplied laborers for the rich estates, and the rich also suffered. Only Don Croce prospered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在吉里安诺死后的两年中，从西西里迁出的移民多达五十万，其中大多数都是青年男性。他们有的前往英国，做园丁、制作冰淇淋和当饭店服务员；有的前往德国，从事繁重的体力劳动；有的前往瑞士，在那个国家当保洁工或者生产杜鹃报时钟；有的移民法国，在厨房打下手或者在服装厂当扫地工；有的落户巴西，在密林中砍伐树木开垦土地；有的去了寒冷的斯堪的纳维亚国家；当然也有少数人比较幸运，被克莱门扎雇用到美国为柯里昂家族服务。这些人被认为是最幸运的。这样一来，西西里岛只剩下老人、小孩和因经济仇杀成为寡妇的女人。那些石屋小村落再也无法为富人的庄园提供劳动力，富人也因此受到了影响。发财的只有唐·克罗切。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Gaspare "Aspanu" Pisciotta had been tried for his crimes as a bandit and sentenced to a life term in the Ucciardone Prison. But it was understood by everyone that he would be given a pardon. His only worry was that he would be murdered while in prison. Still the amnesty did not come. He sent word to Don Croce that unless he was pardoned immediately, he would reveal all the contacts the band had with Trezza, how the new Premier had conspired with Don Croce to murder his own citizens at the Portella della Ginestra.</div>

<div class="line_en">Pisciotta prepared his morning coffee and drank it. He had a fear of being poisoned. So everything in that cup of coffee had been brought to him by his family. The prison food he first fed in tiny portions to the pet parrot he kept in a cage. And for emergencies he kept on one of his shelves, with the embroidery needles and piles of fabric, a huge jar of olive oil. He hoped that by pouring it down his throat, he would counter the effect of the poison or cause himself to vomit it up. He did not fear any other violence -- he was too well guarded. Only visitors he approved were allowed to his cell door; he was never permitted out of this room. He waited patiently for the parrot to eat and digest his food and then ate his own breakfast with good appetite.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮肖塔喝了一杯自己冲的早晨的咖啡。由于害怕被人下毒，那杯咖啡里的所有东西都是由他的家人送来的。监狱里的牢饭他要先拿一小块给他养在笼子里的鹦鹉吃。为防不测，他把一大瓶橄榄油与绣花针和一堆织物绣品一起放在一个书架上。他希望把橄榄油倒进喉咙里能起到解毒作用，或者引发呕吐把吃下去的东西吐出来。他并不害怕其他形式的暴力，因为对他的看守非常严密。只有得到他的同意，探监者才能到他的牢房门口来。他是绝对不准出牢房的。他耐心地等待鹦鹉把东西吃下去，消化了，然后才津津有味地吃自己的早饭。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On the morning after Minister Trezza's ascension to the premiership of Italy, Aspanu Pisciotta awoke at eight in the morning. He had a large cell, filled with plants and large screens of needlework he had taken up during his time in jail. The brilliant silk of the embroidery patterns seemed to quiet his mind, for now he often thought of his childhood with Turi Guiliano, of their love for each other.</div>

<div class="line_en">Hector Adonis left his Palermo apartment and used the tram car to the Ucciardone Prison. The February sun was already hot though it was early morning, and he regretted wearing his black suit and tie. But he felt he must dress formally on such an occasion. He touched the important slip of paper in the breast pocket of his jacket, securely pressed to the bottom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="赫克特·阿多尼斯离开他在巴勒莫的公寓，乘电车前往乌恰敦监狱。虽然才二月份，早晨的太阳已经热烘烘的了。他后悔自己穿了黑色西服，还打了领带。但是他觉得在这样的场合，还是应当穿得庄重一些。他摸了摸上衣口袋里那张重要的纸条，而后把它往口袋下面塞了塞。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As he rode through the city the ghost of Guiliano rode with him. He remembered one morning watching a tram full of carabinieri blown up, one of Guiliano's retaliations for his parents being put in this same prison. And he wondered again how the gentle boy he had taught the classics could commit such a terrible act. Now, though the walls of the buildings he passed were blank, he could still see in his imagination the bold red paint that had inscribed 'long live Guiliano' so often painted on them. Well, his godson had not lived long. But what always troubled Hector Adonis was that Guiliano had been murdered by his lifelong and childhood friend. That was why he had been delighted to receive instructions to deliver the note in his jacket pocket. The note had been sent by Don Croce with specific instructions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在他乘车前往市区的路上，吉里安诺的阴影一直萦绕在他的脑际。他记得有一天早上他亲眼看见一辆满载宪兵的电车被炸毁，这是吉里安诺为报复把他的父母关在这座监狱所采取的行动之一。他再次感到不解，这个曾经听他上过文学经典课程的温文尔雅的学生怎么会犯下这么严重的罪行。虽然沿途这些建筑物墙壁上的标语已经没有了，但他仍然可以想象出经常出现在这些墙壁上、用红色大写字母书写的“吉里安诺万岁”。可是，他的教子寿命并不长。不过一直使他感到不安的是，吉里安诺是被他终身的朋友和儿时的伙伴杀害的。这就是为什么接到要他送交上衣口袋里那张字条的指示之后，他感到非常高兴。字条是唐·克罗切派人送来的，上面附有具体的指示。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The tram stopped in front of the long brick building that was the Ucciardone Prison. It was separated from the street by a stone wall topped by barbed wire. Guards manned the gate, and the perimeter of the wall was patrolled by heavily armed police. Hector Adonis, all necessary documents in hand, was admitted, taken in charge by a special guard, and escorted to the hospital pharmacy. There he was greeted by the pharmacist, a man by the name of Cuto. Cuto wore an immaculate white smock over a business suit with a tie. He, too, had, by some subtle psychological process, decided to dress for the occasion. He greeted Hector Adonis cordially and they sat down to wait.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="电车在乌恰敦监狱前停下。这座监狱是一幢长长的砖结构建筑，由一道带铁丝网的围墙把它和马路隔开。它的大门口有岗哨，围墙四周有全副武装的警察巡逻。赫克特·阿多尼斯持有全部必要的文件，所以被准许进入。他由一名看守领着来到医院的药房。一个叫库托的药剂师接待了他。此人穿着西装，系着领带，外面套着一件洁白的大褂。出于某种微妙的心理，他也决定逢场作戏，穿得正规一些。他很客气地与赫克特·阿多尼斯打招呼，接着两人坐下等候。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, yes," Cuto said. "He is very careful about his health. He has even stopped smoking. It's something curious I've noticed about our prisoners. When they are free they abuse their health -- they smoke to excess, they drink to drunkenness, they fornicate to exhaustion. They don't sleep enough or get enough exercise. Then when they have to spend the rest of their lives in prison, they do push-ups, they spurn tobacco, they watch their diet and are moderate in all things."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哦，是的，”库托回答说，“他非常注意自己的健康，连烟都戒了。这是我在囚犯中注意到的怪现象。他们自由的时候，不把自己的健康当回事——烟是拼命地抽，酒是不醉不罢休，搞女人就搞个精疲力竭。他们睡眠不足，运动很少。可是等他们要在监狱中度过余生的时候，他们又是做俯卧撑，又是戒烟，还注意自己的饮食，无论做什么都适当有度。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Adonis looked around the pharmacy. There were shelves full of medicines and great oaken closets that held bandages and medical instruments, for the pharmacy served as a medical emergency room for the prisoners. There were even two neatly made-up beds in an alcove of the huge rooms.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿多尼斯向药房四周看了看。这里的架子上放的都是药品。大橡木橱里放的是绷带和医疗器械，因为这个药房也用作囚犯的急诊室。在大房间里凹进去的地方还有两张收拾得很干净的床。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In his cell Aspanu Pisciotta took the bottle of streptomycin and broke the elaborate seals. He measured out his dose and swallowed it. He was surprised at the bitterness of the taste for that one second he could think, then his body bent backward in a great arc and was thrown to the floor. He let out a scream that brought the guard running to the cell door. Pisciotta struggled to his feet, fighting off the agonizing pain that wracked his body. There was a terrible rawness in his throat and he staggered toward the jar of olive oil. His body arched again and he screamed to the guard, "I've been poisoned. Help me, help me." And then before he fell again there was a great furiousness that he had finally been outwitted by Don Croce.</div>

<div class="line_en">The guards carrying Pisciotta rushed into the pharmacy shouting that the prisoner had been poisoned. Cuto made them lay Pisciotta on one of the beds in the alcove and examined him. Then he quickly prepared an emetic and poured it down Pisciotta's throat. To the guards he seemed to be doing everything to save Pisciotta. Only Hector Adonis knew that the emetic was a weak solution that would not help the dying man. Adonis moved to the side of the bed and took the slip of paper in his breast pocket, holding it concealed in the palm of his hand. With the pretense of helping the pharmacist, he slipped the paper inside Pisciotta's shirt. At the same time he looked down at Pisciotta's handsome face. It seemed to be contorted with grief, but Adonis knew it was the contraction of terrible pain. Part of the tiny mustache had been gnawed away in his agony. Hector Adonis at that moment said a prayer for his soul and felt a great sadness. He remembered when this man and his godson had walked arm in arm over the hills of Sicily reciting the poetry of Roland and Charlemagne.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几名看守匆匆把皮肖塔抬进药房，大声喊叫说犯人中毒了。库托让他们把皮肖塔躺在凹处的一张床上，给他进行检查。接着他迅速把一帖催吐剂倒进他的喉咙。在看守们看来，他似乎是在竭尽全力抢救皮肖塔。只有赫克特·阿多尼斯知道这帖催吐剂浓度很淡，对这个将死的人来说已无济于事。阿多尼斯走到床边，从上衣口袋里取出那张字条，把它偷偷地藏在手掌心里。他假装帮助药剂师，却趁机把纸条放进了皮肖塔的衬衣里。与此同时，他看了看皮肖塔那张英俊的脸。那张扭曲的脸显得很痛苦，不过阿多尼斯知道这是剧痛造成的抽搐。由于疼痛难忍，他把一部分小胡子都咬掉了。这时候，赫克特·阿多尼斯为他的灵魂做了一次祈祷，同时也感到一阵悲伤。他记得这个人曾经和他的教子手挽手地行走在西西里的山上，背诵有关罗兰和查理大帝的诗句。">查看中文翻译</div>
