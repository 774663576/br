<div class="line_en">Clare was a thoughtful, honest man. He knew Tess was not a toy to play with and throw away when finished with. Her life was as important to her as his was to him. He knew he must treat her affection for him seriously. But if they went on meeting every day, their relationship must develop: he could not stop himself. As he had not decided what purpose their relationship should have, he decided that for the moment they should meet as little as possible. But it was not easy to keep to this decision. He was driven towards her by the heat in his blood.</div>

<div class="line_en">The nights were as hot as the days. Angel Clare could not sleep. He went out into the darkness to think over what had happened that afternoon. He had come as a student of farming to this dairy, thinking he would be here only a short time. He thought it would be a quiet place. From here he could observe the great world outside, before plunging back into it. But the world outside had lost its interest, and the quiet place was now the centre of all feeling.</div>

<div class="line_en">His family were delighted, though surprised, to see him. Angel was glad to be at home, and yet he did not feel so much part of the family as he used to. His father's religious belief was very strict, but he was a kind, honest man, and fond of his sons. However, he would have been shocked to know of the pagan pleasure in nature and pretty womanhood experienced by Angel. His mother shared his father's religious views and helped in his church work. His brothers seemed rather unimaginative and narrow-minded, although they were both well educated: they felt that anybody outside the Church or university could not be respected.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管有些惊讶，他的家人见到他还是很高兴。回到家安吉尔也感到很愉快，然而他不再像过去那样觉得自己是这个家庭的重要组成部分了。他父亲恪守宗教信条，非常严格，但他是个和善正直的人，深爱着他的孩子们。然而，他若是知道安吉尔从自然界和漂亮女人身上所获得的非基督教的快乐，一定会感到震惊的。他母亲有着同父亲一样的宗教观念，并帮助父亲从事教堂的工作。他的哥哥们看起来相当枯燥死板，而且心胸狭窄，尽管他们俩都受过良好的教育，但他们觉得任何教堂或大学外的人都不应受到尊敬。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As he rode into the village, he saw a group of young girls waiting outside the church. Walking quickly to join them was Miss Mercy Chant, only daughter of his father's neighbour. His parents quietly hoped Angel would marry Mercy one day. She was very good at giving Bible classes, but in Angel's mind was the face of the pretty milkmaid who hardly ever thought of God.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他骑马进村时，他看到一群年轻姑娘正等候在教堂外面。默茜·钱特小姐正快步走去加入她们，她是他父亲家邻居的独生女。他的父母都暗暗地希望有一天安吉尔能和默茜结婚。她对于传授《圣经》知识非常在行，但安吉尔的心被一张漂亮的面孔占据了，就是那个几乎从没有想起过上帝的挤奶女工的面孔。">查看中文翻译</div>

They thought farming was a poor man's job, not suitable for a gentleman. Angel felt all the more determined to keep to his choice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当他和哥哥们走在一起时，安吉尔感觉到，尽管他们俩很幸运地接受了大学教育，但没有一个能实事求是地看待生活。他们认为务农是穷人的职业，对一个绅士来说是不合适的。安吉尔坚持自己选择的决心更坚定了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As he set off to return to the dairy and Tess, his father rode with him a little way. Mr Clare was telling his son about the new D'Urberville family who had taken the ancient name and lived near Trantridge. There was a young man and his blind mother.

<div class="line_en">Angel could not accept his father's narrow religious beliefs, but he loved him for his courage. He remembered that his father had not once asked whether Tess had money or not.

<div class="line_en">Tess could not accept her mother's view of life, but perhaps Joan was right in this. Silence seemed best for Angel's happiness. So she grew calm, and from October onwards she was completely happy. Clare seemed the perfect guide, thinker, and friend. She saw perfection in his face, his intelligence, and his soul. She dismissed the past from her mind. They spent all their time together, as country people do once they are engaged. In the wonderful autumn afternoons they walked by streams, crossing on little wooden bridges. They saw tiny blue fogs in the shadows of trees and hedges, and at the same time bright sunshine in the fields. The sun was so near the ground that the shadows of Clare and Tess stretched a quarter of a mile ahead of them, like two long pointing fingers. When Clare talked to Tess of their future, and the farm they would have abroad, she could hardly believe that she would be going through the world by his side. Her feeling for him was now the breath and life of Tess's being. It 152 made her forget her past sorrows, but she knew they were waiting like wolves for their moment to attack.</div>
