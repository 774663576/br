<div class="line_en">For twenty years he had seen his mother -- a poor, weak creature who needed his protection -- in his wife. This image was deeply rooted in him, and he could not rid himself of it in two dys. On the way home his conscience began to bother him: he was afraid that Marie-Claude had fallen apart after he left and that he would find her terribly sick at heart. Stealthily he unlocked the door and went into his room. He stood there for a moment and listened: Yes, she was at home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="二十多年来，他在妻子身上看到的是母亲的影子，是一个需要他保护的弱者；这种观念在他头脑里已经根深蒂固，仅两天时间是无法摆脱的。回家时，他心中不禁有些歉疚：在他离家后，妻子可能已经崩溃，他也许会看到她痛不欲生的样子；他胆怯地扭转钥匙开了门锁，回到自己房间。他小心翼翼，不弄出声响，侧耳细听。是的，她在家。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Where else can I go? he wanted to say (genuinely surprised), but said nothing.</div>

<div class="line_en">When he made his confession on the day he left for Rome, he had no precise plan of action. He expected to come home and talk it all out in a friendly atmosphere so as not to harm Marie-Claude any more than necessary. It never occurred to him that she would calmly and coolly urge him to leave.</div>

<div class="line_en">Evening came, and he did not know where to turn. All his life he had shared his bed with Marie-Claude. If he went home to Marie-Claude, where should he sleep?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="好几个小时过去了，他不知该怎么办。他这辈子一直都与玛丽—克洛德睡在一张床上。如果现在回家，是不是该跟从前一样躺在她身边？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That afternoon, he gave his lecture, then went straight to Sabina's from the university. He had decided to ask her whether he could spend the night. He rang the doorbell, but no one answered. He went and sat at the cafe across the street and stared long and hard at the entrance to her building.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="下午课后，他从学校出来直奔萨比娜的住处。他打算求她让他留下过夜。他按响门铃，没人应。他去对面的咖啡馆里等着，两眼直盯着那幢楼的大门。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He could, of course, make up a bed on the sofa in the next room. But wouldn't that be merely an eccentric gesture? Wouldn't it look like a sign of ill will?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，他还可以把隔壁房间的长沙发当床睡，但那样是不是太过分了？她会不会认为是敌意的表现？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Even though it facilitated things, he could not help feeling disappointed. He had been afraid of wounding her all his life and voluntarily stuck to a stultifying discipline of monogamy, and now, after twenty years, he suddenly learned that it had all been superfluous and he had given up scores of women because of a misunderstanding!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管她的这种态度使他省却不少麻烦，他还是感觉失落。这一辈子他都担心伤害她，也正是为了这一点他才自动给自己套上了愚蠢的一夫一妻制这条准则。结果二十年过去，才发觉自己多虑无益，竟因这份误解而把多少女人拒之门外！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He wanted to remain friends with her, after all! Yet getting into bed with her was out of the question. He could just hear her asking him ironically why he didn't prefer Sabina's bed. He took a room in a hotel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他希望和妻子依然是朋友！可再与她共枕也做不到。他仿佛已听到她的冷嘲热讽：怎么了？他不是宁愿要萨比娜的那张床的吗？于是他选了一间旅馆住下。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">During the next few days, he returned at regular intervals, still hoping to find her in, but one day he found the door open and three men in overalls loading the furniture and paintings into a van parked outside.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他本来准备塞给这些人几张钞票叫他们透露一下秘密，可忽然之间泄了气。他因悲哀而彻底麻木了。对这一切，他一点也不明白，也不可能明白，只是意识到从遇到萨比娜的那天起，他便料到这一刻。该来的事情已经来临。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At last he had ceased to be a little boy; for the first time in his life he was on his own. The next day he hired a carpenter to make a bookcase for him. He spent several days designing it and deciding where it should stand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他人生第一次结束了当小男孩的日子，独立了。第二天会有一名细木工匠过来，他要请木匠做个书柜。他花了几个星期，亲手设计了外形、规格和安放的位置。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One day, he saw her through the window of a cafe. She was sitting with two women, and her face, long riddled with wrinkles from her unbridled gift for grimaces, was in a state of animation. The women were listening closely and laughing continually. Franz could not get over the feeling that she was telling them about him. Surely she knew that Sabina had disappeared from Geneva at the very time Franz decided to live with her. What a funny story it would make! He was not the least bit surprised at becoming a butt to his wife's friends.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天，他望见妻子坐在一家咖啡馆的玻璃窗后。玛丽—克洛德和两个女士在一起，脸上显出十分兴奋的样子，由于喜好夸张而滑稽的表演，她的那张脸上早已刻下了数不清的皱纹。两个女人在听着她说话，还不住地大笑。弗兰茨不禁觉得她正在跟她们谈论他自己。妻子一定知道，在他决意与萨比娜一起生活的那一刻，萨比娜便从日内瓦消失了。真是个可笑的故事！就这样成了妻子女友们的笑柄，他自己也不感到奇怪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When he got home to his new flat, where every hour he could hear the bells of Saint-Pierre, he found that the department store had delivered his new desk. He promptly forgot about Marie-Claude and her friends. He even forgot about Sabina for the time being. He sat down at the desk. He was glad to have picked it out himself. For twenty years he had lived among furniture not of his own choosing. Marie-Claude had taken care of everything.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他回到新居，在那儿可以听见圣彼得大教堂的排钟齐鸣声。当天，商店给他送来了买好的桌子。他把玛丽—克洛德和她的女友抛在脑后，一时还忘却了萨比娜。他到桌边坐下，为亲自挑选了它而感到高兴。二十年来，他一直生活在并非自己所选的家具之中。玛丽—克洛德包办了一切。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Actually, he had always preferred the unreal to the real. Just as he felt better at demonstrations (which, as I have pointed out, are all playacting and dreams) than in a lecture hall full of students, so he was happier with Sabina the invisible goddess than the Sabina who had accompanied him throughout the world and whose love he constantly feared losing. By giving him the unexpected freedom of a man living on his own, she provided him with a halo of seductiveness. He became very attractive to women, and one of his students fell in love with him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而且，他一向偏爱虚幻胜于现实。如同他喜欢身处游行队伍之中（我已经说过，那些游行不过是一场戏，一个梦）。而不爱站在讲台后给学生授课，因此，比起同萨比娜周游世界，比起战战兢兢一步步索求她的爱情，与幻化为无形女神的她相守更加幸福。她赐给他的，是突然而至的男子汉的自由，为此，她给他罩上了魅力的光环。他变得对女人颇具吸引力，一个女学生爱上了他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And at some point, he realized to his great surprise that he was not particularly unhappy. Sabina's physical presence was much less important than he had suspected. What was important was the golden footprint, the magic footprint she had left on his life and no one could ever remove. Just before disappearing from his horizon, she had slipped him Hercules' broom, and he had used it to sweep everything he despised out of his life. A sudden happiness, a feeling of bliss, the joy that came of freedom and a new life -- these were the gifts she had left him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此时，他猛然惊诧地发现其实自己并非不幸。萨比娜的人在不在根本不像他所以为的那么重要。重要的是她在他的生命当中留下的那道灿烂而神奇的印迹，无人可以夺走。何况在从他的世界里消失之前，她已将赫拉克勒斯巨人之帚交到他手中，而他也已用之将一切厌恶的东西通通从自己的生活中清扫了出去。这不期的幸福，这美好的生活，这由新生和自由带来的欢乐，是她给他留下的礼物。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And so within an amazingly short period the backdrop of his life had changed completely. Until recently he had lived in a large upper-middle-class flat with a servant, a daughter, and a wife; now he lived in a tiny flat in the old part of town, where almost every night he was joined by his young student-mistress.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就这样，在短暂得令人难以置信的一瞬间，他整个人生的境况彻底改变了。就在不久之前，他还住在一套布尔乔亚的大房子里，有女佣、女儿和妻子，现在却身处旧城区的一个单间公寓，而他年轻的女友几乎天天到他这儿过夜！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She was a modest girl and not particularly pretty, but she admired Franz in the way Franz had only recently admired Sabina. He did not find it unpleasant. And if he did perhaps feel that trading Sabina for a student with glasses was something for a comedown, his innate goodness saw to it that he cared for her and lavished on her the paternal love that had never had a true outlet before, given that Marie-Anne had always behaved less like his daughter than like a copy of Marie-Claude.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她长得既不难看也不漂亮，可毕竟比他年纪小那么多！而且她仰慕弗兰茨，一如当初弗兰茨仰慕萨比娜那样。这并不让人讨厌。也许，他会觉得这个戴眼镜的女学生当作萨比娜的替身略为逊色，但他的仁爱之心要求他欢欢喜喜地接纳她，并向她倾注一种他从来未能如愿付出过的父爱，因为女儿玛丽—安娜举手投足从不像是个女儿，反倒像另一个玛丽—克洛德。">查看中文翻译</div>
