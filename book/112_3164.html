<div class="line_en">It was our third time playing the Godfather theme since lunch, so I was looking around at the tourists seated across the piazza to see how many of them might have been there the last time we'd played it. People don't mind hearing a favourite more than once, but you can't have it happen too often or they start suspecting you don't have a decent repertoire. At this time of year, it's usually okay to repeat numbers. The first hint of an autumn wind and the ridiculous price of a coffee ensure a pretty steady turnover of customers. Anyway, that's why I was studying the faces in the piazza and that's how I spotted Tibor.</div>

<div class="line_en">He was waving his arm and I thought at first he was waving to us, but then I realised he was trying to attract a waiter. He looked older, and he'd put on some weight, but he wasn't hard to recognise. I gave Fabian, on accordion right next to me, a little nudge and nodded towards the young man, though I couldn't take either hand off my saxophone just then to point him out properly. That was when it came home to me, looking around the band, that apart from me and Fabian, there was no one left in our line-up from that summer we'd met Tibor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他正挥舞着手臂，一开始我以为他是在跟我们挥手，后来发现他是在招呼服务生。他看上去比以前老，还胖了些，但不难认出来。我用胳膊肘轻轻地推了推身边拉手风琴的费边，摆头示意他注意那个年轻人，因为当时我没法从萨克斯上腾出手来指给他看。就在这时，当我环顾乐队时，突然间发现：我们认识蒂博尔的那年夏天，当时在乐队里的那群人就只剩下我和费边了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When we finished our number, Fabian gave me a dirty look, annoyed I'd nudged him during his "special passage"-- not a solo exactly, but one of those rare moments when the violin and clarinet have stopped, I'm blowing just quiet notes in the background, and he's holding the tune together on his accordion. When I tried to explain, pointing out Tibor, now stirring his coffee beneath a parasol, Fabian seemed to have trouble remembering him. In the end, he said:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这首歌演完了，费边狠狠地瞪了我一眼，怪我在他的“特别片段”推了他——算不上独奏，却是一段小提琴和单簧管难得停下来的时候，我的萨克斯以柔和的音符给他伴奏，由他的手风琴把持调子。我跟他解释，把蒂博尔指给他看，这会儿蒂博尔正在阳伞下搅动着咖啡。费边想了好一会儿才认出他来，说：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Okay, that was all of seven years ago, but it was still a shock. Playing together every day like this, you come to think of the band as a kind of family, the other members as your brothers. And if every now and then someone moves on, you want to think he'll always stay in touch, sending back postcards from Venice or London or wherever he's got to, maybe a Polaroid of the band he's in now -- just like he's writing home to his old village. So a moment like that comes as an unwelcome reminder of how quickly things change. How the bosom pals of today become lost strangers tomorrow, scattered across Europe, playing the Godfather theme or "Autumn Leaves" in squares and cafes you'll never visit.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没错，那是七年前的事了，可我还是感到不小的震撼。像这样天天在一起演出，渐渐地你会把乐队当作家，把乐队里的其他成员当作你的兄弟。当时不时有人离开的时候，你就会想他们会一直保持联系，从威尼斯、伦敦或其他地方寄明信片回来，抑或是寄一张目前所在乐队的照片——就像给老家写信一样。因此想到以前的乐队就剩我们两个人，不禁令人感慨世事无常。今日的知己明日就变成失去联络的陌路人，分散在欧洲各地，在你永远不会去的广场和咖啡厅里演奏着《教父》或者《秋叶》。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I was disappointed Fabian hadn't shown more interest, but I suppose he'd never been one of those particularly concerned about the young cellist. Fabian, you see, he's only ever played in bars and cafes. Not like Giancarlo, our violin player at that time, or Ernesto, who was our bass player. They'd had formal training, so to them someone like Tibor was always fascinating. Maybe there was a tiny bit of jealousy there -- of Tibor's top-drawer musical education, of the fact that his future was still in front of him. But to be fair, I think it was just that they liked to take the Tibors of this world under their wing, look after them a little, maybe prepare them for what lay ahead, so when the disappointments came they wouldn't be quite so hard to take.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我很失望费边对蒂博尔的出现不怎么感兴趣，不过我想他跟其他人不一样，从来就不曾对这个年轻的大提琴手有特别的兴趣。是这样的，费边只是个在酒吧和咖啡厅里演出的乐手，不像詹卡洛，我们当时的小提琴手，或者欧内斯托，当时的贝司手，他们是受过专业训练的，所以他们对蒂博尔这样的人总是很感兴趣。也许是有一点点的嫉妒在里面——嫉妒蒂博尔受过顶级的音乐教育，嫉妒他还有大好的前途。但平心而论，我觉得他们只是想保护像蒂博尔这样的人，给他们一些帮助，甚至让他们对未来做好准备，这样，当事情不尽人意的时候，他们就不会太接受不了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That summer seven years ago had been an unusually warm one, and even in this city of ours, there were times you could believe we were down on the Adriatic. We played outdoors for over four months -- under the cafe awning, facing out to the piazza and all the tables -- and I can tell you that's hot work, even with two or three electric fans whirring around you. But it made for a good season, plenty of tourists passing through, a lot from Germany and Austria, as well as natives fleeing the heat down on the beaches. And that was the summer we first started noticing Russians. Today you don't think twice about Russian tourists, they look like everyone else. But back then, they were still rare enough to make you stop and stare. Their clothes were odd and they moved around like new kids at school. The first time we saw Tibor, we were between sets, refreshing ourselves at the big table the cafe always kept aside for us. He was sitting nearby, continually getting up and repositioning his cello case to keep it in the shade.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="七年前的那个夏天异常炎热，即便在这个城市有时也感觉像是在亚得里亚海。我们要在室外演出四个多月——在咖啡店的遮阳篷底下，面对着广场和所有的桌子——告诉你吧，干这活儿热得不得了，就算有两三台电扇在你旁边呼呼地吹。可是这倒带来了好生意，游客熙熙攘攘，很多是从德国和奥地利来的。本地的居民也跑到沙滩上来乘凉。那年夏天我们还开始留意到俄国人。如今看见俄国游客不稀奇，他们和其他游客没什么两样。可当时俄国人还很罕见，让人不禁停下来看几眼。他们穿着古怪，像学校里新来的小孩子一般不自在。我们第一次见到蒂博尔是在幕间休息的时候，我们在一旁咖啡厅为我们准备的一张大桌子旁休息喝饮料。他就坐在旁边，不停地起来摆弄琴箱，不让太阳照到。">查看中文翻译</div>

And sometimes if he came to the cafe during our evening session, we'd call him over afterwards, maybe treat him to some wine and crostini.</div>

<div class="line_en">We soon discovered Tibor was Hungarian, not Russian; that he was probably older than he looked, because he'd already studied at the Royal Academy of Music in London, then spent two years in Vienna under Oleg Petrovic. After a rocky start with the old maestro, he'd learnt to handle those legendary temper tantrums and had left Vienna full of confidence -- and with a series of engagements in prestigious, if small, venues around Europe. But then concerts began to get cancelled due to low demand; he'd been forced to perform music he hated; accommodation had proved expensive or sordid.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不久我们就知道了蒂博尔不是俄国人，是匈牙利人；他的实际年龄要比长相大一些，他在伦敦的皇家音乐学院学习过，然后在维也纳待了两年，师从奥列格·彼得罗维奇。经过一开始痛苦的适应期后，他学会了应付大师出了名的坏脾气，信心满满地离开维也纳——应邀到欧洲一些不大、但是很有名的地方演出。可是后来由于演出市场不景气，演出逐渐被取消；他开始被迫演奏一些他讨厌的音乐；住的地方也又贵又脏。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So our city's well-organised Arts and Culture Festival -- which was what brought him here that summer -- had been a much-needed boost, and when an old friend from the Royal Academy had offered him a free apartment for the summer down near the canal, he'd taken it up without hesitation. He was enjoying our city, he told us, but cash was always a problem, and though he'd had the occasional recital, he was now having to think hard about his next move.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是乎我们这里精心组织的文化艺术节——那年夏天他正是为此而来——就成了他最需要的助推器。当皇家学院的一个老朋友愿意夏天把运河旁的一间公寓借给他时，他毫不犹豫就答应了。他说他很喜欢我们的城市，可是钱永远是个问题，虽然他偶尔有些演出，但现在他不得不好好考虑下一步怎么走了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was after a while of listening to these worries that Giancarlo and Ernesto decided we should try and do something for him. And that was how Tibor got to meet Mr. Kaufmann, from Amsterdam, a distant relative of Giancarlo's with connections in the hotel world.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="听说了蒂博尔的烦恼以后不久，詹卡洛和欧内斯托决定：我们应该为他做些事情。就这样蒂博尔见到了阿姆斯特丹来的考夫曼先生，詹卡洛的一个远房亲戚，在酒店界有点关系。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I remember that evening very well. It was still early in the summer, and Mr. Kaufmann, Giancarlo, Ernesto, all the rest of us, we sat indoors, in the back room of the cafe, listening to Tibor play his cello. The young man must have realised he was auditioning for Mr. Kaufmann, so it's interesting now to remember how keen he was to perform that night. He was obviously grateful to us, and you could see he was pleased when Mr. Kaufmann promised to do what he could for him on his return to Amsterdam. When people say Tibor changed for the worse that summer, that his head got too big for his own good, that this was all down to the American woman, well, maybe there's something in that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我仍然清楚地记得那个晚上。那时还是初夏，考夫曼先生、詹卡洛、欧内斯托，还有乐队里其他所有的人，我们坐在咖啡厅的里屋，听蒂博尔拉琴。年轻人一定是知道这是考夫曼先生的试听，所以那天晚上表演得特别卖力，现在回想起来真是有意思。他显然很感激我们，当考夫曼先生答应回阿姆斯特丹以后会尽力帮助他的时候，他的喜悦之情溢于言表。大家说那年夏天蒂博尔开始走下坡路，说他头脑发热、不知好歹，说都是因为那个美国女人，咳，也许不无道理。">查看中文翻译</div>

At that moment, the piazza was pleasantly cool -- the cafe end remains shaded for much of the morning -- and the paving stones were still wet from the city workers' hoses. Having gone without breakfast, he'd watched enviously while at the next table she'd ordered a series of fruit-juice concoctions, then -- apparently on a whim, for it wasn't yet ten o'clock -- a bowl of steamed mussels. He had the vague impression the woman was, for her part, stealing glances back at him, but hadn't thought too much about it. "She looked very pleasant, beautiful even," he told us at the time. "But as you see, she's ten, fifteen years older than me. So why would I think anything was going on?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Over the next two days he found himself thinking about the encounter many times. He saw again the smirk around her mouth as he'd so proudly announced Petrovic's name and felt the anger rising afresh. But on reflection, he could see he had not really been angry on his old teacher's behalf. It was rather that he had become accustomed to the idea that Petrovic's name would always produce a certain impact, that it could be relied upon to induce attention and respect: in other words, he'd come to depend on it as a sort of certificate he could brandish around the world. What had so disturbed him was the possibility that this certificate didn't carry nearly the weight he'd supposed.</div>

<div class="line_en">The idea of entering her room, even in the middle of the afternoon, had struck him as awkwardly intimate, and he was relieved to find a large suite, the bedroom closed off entirely from view. The tall French windows had boarded shutters, for the moment folded back, so the lace curtains moved in the breeze, and he could see that by stepping through onto the balcony, he'd find himself looking over the square. The room itself, with its rough stone walls and dark wood floor, had almost a monastic air about it, softened only partially by the flowers, cushions and antique furniture. She, in contrast, was dressed in T-shirt, tracksuit trousers and trainers, as though she'd just come in from running.

<div class="line_en">She had indicated a polished upright chair carefully placed in the centre of the room, so he sat down on it and unpacked his cello. Rather disconcertingly, she sat herself in front of one of the big windows so that he could see her almost exactly in profile, and she continued to stare into the space before her all the time he tuned up. Her posture didn't alter as he began to play, and when he came to the end of his first piece, she didn't say a word. So he moved quickly to another piece, and then another. A half-hour went by, then a whole hour. And something to do with the shaded room and its austere acoustics, the afternoon sunlight diffused by the drifting lace curtains, the background hubbub rising from the piazza, and above all, her presence, drew from him notes that held new depths, new suggestions. Towards the end of the hour, he was convinced he'd more than fulfilled her expectations, but when he had finished his last piece, and they had sat in silence for several moments, she at last turned in her chair towards him and said:</div>

He'd felt only a tiny nudge of suspicion when, looking around her room, he'd seen no sign of her own cello. After all, it was perfectly natural she wouldn't bring a cello on holiday with her.

<div class="line_en">But as he'd continued to return to the suite for further sessions, the suspicions had grown. He'd done his best to push them out of his mind, for by this time, he'd lost any lingering reservations about their meetings. The mere fact that she was listening to him seemed to draw fresh layers from his imagination, and in the hours between these afternoon sessions, he'd often find himself preparing a piece in his mind, anticipating her comments, her shakes of the head, her frown, the affirming nod, and most gratifying of all, those instances she became transported by a passage he was playing, when her eyes would close and her hands, almost against her will, began shadowing the movements he was making. All the same, the suspicions wouldn't go away, and then one day he came to the room and the bedroom door had been left ajar. He could see more stone walls, what looked to be a medieval four-poster bed, but no trace of a cello. Would a virtuoso, even on holiday, go so long without touching her instrument? But this question, too, he pushed out of his mind.</div>

<div class="line_en">She would laugh much more easily now than in the first days of their friendship, and she developed the habit, when they stepped out of the Excelsior and crossed the piazza, of linking her arm through his. This was the point at which we first started noticing them, a curious couple, he looking so much younger than he actually was, she looking in some ways motherly, in other ways "like a flirty actress," as Ernesto put it. In the days before we got to talking with Tibor, we used to waste a lot of idle chat on them, the way men in a band do. If they strolled past us, arm in arm, we'd look at each other and say: "What do you think? They've been at it, yes?" But having enjoyed the speculation, we'd then shrug and admit it was unlikely: they just didn't have the atmosphere of lovers. And once we came to know Tibor, and he began telling us about those afternoons in her suite, none of us thought to tease him or make any funny suggestions.</div>

<div class="line_en">Towards the end of september -- there was now a chill in the breeze -- Giancarlo received a phone call from Mr. Kaufmann in Amsterdam; there was a vacancy for a cellist in a small chamber group at a five-star hotel in the centre of the city. The group played in a minstrels' gallery overlooking the dining room four evenings a week, and the musicians also had other "light, non-musical duties" elsewhere in the hotel. Board and accommodation terms were available. Mr. Kaufmann had immediately remembered Tibor and the post was being held open for him. We gave Tibor the news straight away -- in the cafe the very evening of Mr. Kaufmann's call -- and I think we were all taken aback by the coolness of Tibor's response. It was certainly a contrast to his attitude earlier in the summer, when we'd fixed up his "audition" with Mr. Kaufmann. Giancarlo, in particular, became very angry.</div>

No, please, don't try and stop me this time. I want to say this. If you gave me that cello right now and asked me to play, I'd have to say no, I can't do it. Not because the instrument isn't good enough, nothing like that. But if you're now thinking I'm a fake, that I've somehow pretended to be something I'm not, then I want to tell you you're mistaken. Look at everything we've achieved together. Isn't that proof enough I'm no fake anything? Yes, I told you I was a virtuoso. Well, let me explain what I meant by that. What I meant was that I was born with a very special gift, just as you were. You and me, we have something most other cellists will never have, no matter how hard they practise. I was able to recognise it in you, the moment I first heard you in that church. And in some way, you must have recognised it in me too. That's why you decided to come to this hotel that first time."</div>

You have to understand, I am a virtuoso. But I'm one who's yet to be unwrapped. You too, you're still not entirely unwrapped, and that's what I've been doing these past few weeks. I've been trying to help you shed those layers. But I never tried to deceive you. Ninety-nine per cent of cellists, there's nothing there under those layers, there's nothing to unwrap. So people like us, we have to help each other. When we see each other in a crowded square, wherever, we have to reach out for one another, because there are so few of us."</div>

I'm forty-one years old now. But at least I haven't damaged what I was born with. I've met so many teachers over the years who've said they'd help me, but I saw through them. Sometimes it's difficult to tell, Tibor, even for us. These teachers, they're so… professional, they talk so well, you listen and at first you're fooled. You think, yes, at last, someone to help me, he's one of us. Then you realise he's nothing of the kind. And that's when you have to be tough and shut yourself off.

He'd worried beforehand how things would be, after her "confession" and the way they'd last parted, but all the tension seemed simply to have evaporated, and the atmosphere between them felt better than ever. Even when, after he'd finished a piece, she closed her eyes and embarked on a long, stringent critique of his performance, he felt no resentment, only a hunger to understand her as fully as possible. The next day and the day after, it was the same: relaxed, at times even jokey, and he felt sure he'd never played better in his life. They didn't allude at all to that conversation before he'd gone away, nor did she ask about his break in the countryside. They only talked about the music.</div>

The last time we had drinks with him, he was clearly very grateful to Giancarlo and Ernesto for his job, and to us all for our friendship, but I couldn't help getting the impression he was being a little aloof with us. A few of us thought this, not just me, though Giancarlo, typically, now took Tibor's side, saying the boy had just been feeling excited and nervous about this next step in his life.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Excited? How can he be excited?" Ernesto said. "He's spent the summer being told he's a genius. A hotel job, it's a comedown. Sitting talking to us, that's a comedown too. He was a nice kid at the start of the summer. But after what that woman's done to him, I'm glad we're seeing the back of him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“兴奋？他怎么可能兴奋？”欧内斯托说。“整个夏天他都被别人叫做天才。到酒店工作是委屈了他。坐在这里跟我们聊天也是委屈了他。夏天刚到那会儿他还是个好孩子。可那女人对他做了那些事以后，我很高兴能看见他回来。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Like I said, this all happened seven years ago. Giancarlo, Ernesto, all the boys from that time except me and Fabian, they've all moved on. Until I spotted him in the piazza the other day, I hadn't thought about our young Hungarian maestro for a long time. He wasn't so hard to recognise. He'd put on weight, certainly, and was looking a lot thicker around the neck. And the way he gestured with his finger, calling for a waiter, there was something -- maybe I imagined this -- something of the impatience, the off-handedness that comes with a certain kind of bitterness. But maybe that's unfair. After all, I only glimpsed him. Even so, it seemed to me he'd lost that youthful anxiety to please, and those careful manners he had back then. No bad thing in this world, you might say.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我说过了，这是七年前的事了。詹卡洛、欧内斯托，当时乐队里的其他人，除了我和费边都走了。我很久没再想起我们这位年轻的匈牙利天才，直到那天偶然在广场上发现他。他没怎么变，只是胖了些，脖子粗了好一圈。他用手指头招呼服务生的动作——也许是我的想象——有些不耐烦，有些粗鲁，自然而然就有些愤恨。我这么说可能不公平，毕竟我只瞥了他几眼。但我还是觉得他似乎失去了年轻时的快活劲儿和以前认认真真的态度。你可能会说在这世上这不是什么坏事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I would have gone over and talked with him, but by the end of our set he'd already gone. For all I know, he was here only for the afternoon. He was wearing a suit -- nothing very grand, just a regular one -- so perhaps he has a day job now behind a desk somewhere. Maybe he had some business to do nearby and came through our city just for old times' sake, who knows? If he comes back to the square, and I'm not playing, I'll go over and have a word with him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我本想过去跟他聊聊，可是等表演结束，他已经走了。据我所知，他只在广场上待了一个下午。他穿着西装——不是什么特别好的，普通西装而已——所以我猜他现在白天在哪里坐办公室。他可能是到附近办事，想起以前的时光，顺路到这里来一下，谁知道？要是他再到广场上来时我不在演出的话，我一定过去跟他聊聊。">查看中文翻译</div>
