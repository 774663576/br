<div class="line_en">My highly educated dad recommended that I do what he did. "Son, I want you to study hard, get good grades, so you can find a safe, secure job with a big company. And make sure it has excellent benefits." My rich dad wanted me to learn how money works so I could make it work for me. These lessons I would learn through life with his guidance, not because of a classroom.</div>

<div class="line_en">On that bright Saturday morning, I was learning a completely different point of view from what I had been taught by my poor dad. At the age of 9, I grew aware that both dads wanted me to learn. Both dads encouraged me to study… but not the same things.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在那个明媚的星期六上午，我接受了一种与穷爸爸教我的方式完全不同的学习方式。就在那一刻，我意识到两位爸爸都希望我去学习，鼓励我去研究，但研究的内容不同。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My rich dad continued my first lesson, "I'm glad you got angry about working for 10 cents an hour. If you had not gotten angry and had gladly accepted it, I would have to tell you that I could not teach you. You see, true learning takes energy, passion, a burning desire. Anger is a big part of that formula, for passion is anger and love combined. When it comes to money, most people want to play it safe and feel secure. So passion does not direct them: Fear does."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="富爸爸继续着我的第一课：“我很高兴你为每小时10美分而生气，如果你不生气而是高兴地接受了它，那我只能告诉你我没法教你。真正的学习需要精力、激情和热切的愿望。愤怒是其中一个重要的成分，因为激情正是愤怒和热爱的结合物。说到钱，大多数人希望稳稳妥妥地挣到，他们很少有挣钱的激情，于是，只好有没钱的恐惧。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“这就是他们接受低工资工作的原因喽？”我问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes," said rich dad. "Some people say I exploit people because I don't pay as much as the sugar plantation or the government. I say the people exploit themselves. It's their fear, not mine."</div>

<div class="line_en">"I don't have to. And besides, more money will not solve the problem. Just look at your dad. He makes a lot of money, and he still can't pay his bills. Most people, given more money, only get into more debt."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你不这么认为吗？”我问。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“这就是1小时10美分的原因？”我笑了，“课程的第一部分。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That's right," smiled rich dad. "You see, your dad went to school and got an excellent education, so he could get a high-paying job. Which he did. But he still has money problems because he never learned anything about money at school. On top of that, he believes in working for money."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“没错。”富爸爸也笑了，“你瞧，你爸进了大学而且受到很好的教育，所以他能得到一份高薪的工作。他的确也得到了，但他还是为钱所困，原因就是他在学校里从来没学过关于钱的知识。而且最大的问题是，他相信工作就是为了钱。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Don't worry about that for now. Just know that it's fear that keeps most people working at a job. The fear of not paying their bills. The fear of being fired. The fear of not having enough money. The fear of starting over. That's the price of studying to learn a profession or trade, and then working for money. Most people become a slave to money… and then get angry at their boss."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“别担心，你只须知道，正是出于恐惧心，人们大多害怕失去工作，害怕付不起账单，害怕遭到火灾，害怕没有足够的钱，害怕挨饿，大多数人期望得到一份稳定的工作。为了寻求稳定，他们会去学习某种专业，或做生意，拼命为钱而工作，大多数人成了钱的奴隶，然后把怒气对准他们的老板。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We sat in silence on that beautiful Hawaiian Saturday morning. My friends would have just been starting their Little League baseball game.

<div class="line_en">"As I said, there is a lot to learn. Learning how to have money work for you is a lifetime study. Most people go to college for four years, and their education ends. I already know that my study of money will continue over my lifetime, simply because the more I Find out, the more I find out I need to know. Most people never study the subject. They go to work, get their paycheck, balance their checkbooks, and that's it. On top of that, they wonder why they have money problems. Then, they think that more money will solve the problem. Few realize that it's their lack of financial education that is the problem."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Look," said rich dad. "Taxes are just one small section on learning how to have money work for you. Today, I just wanted to find out if you still have the passion to learn about money. Most people don't. They want to go to school, learn a profession, have fun at their work, and earn lots of money. One day they wake up with big money problems, and then they can't stop working. That's the price of only knowing how to work for money instead of studying how to have money work for you. So do you still have the passion to learn?" asked rich dad.</div>

Most people never see the trap they are in."</div>

<div class="line_en">My little 9-year-old brain and heart nearly exploded. After all, it was 1956 and being paid $2 an hour would have made me the richest kid in the world. I couldn't imagine earning that kind of money. I wanted to say "yes." I wanted the deal. I could see a new bicycle, new baseball glove, and adoration of my friends when I flashed some cash. On top of that, Jimmy and his rich friends could never call me poor again. But somehow my mouth stayed silent.</div>

<div class="line_en">Rich dad was looking at two boys staring back at him, eyes wide open and brains empty. He knew he was testing us, and he knew there was a part of our emotions that wanted to take the deal. He knew that each human being has a weak and needy part of their soul that can be bought. And he knew that each human being also had a part of their soul that was strong and filled with a resolve that could never be bought. It was only a question of which one was stronger. He had tested thousands of souls in his life. He tested souls every time he interviewed someone for a job.</div>

<div class="line_en">Suddenly there was a silence from inside me. Something had changed. The offer was too big and had gotten ridiculous. Not too many grownups in 1956 made more than $5 an hour. The temptation disappeared, and a calm set in. Slowly I turned to my left to look at Mike. He looked back at me. The part of my soul that was weak and needy was silenced. The part of me that had no price took over. There was a calm and a certainty about money that entered my brain and my soul. I knew Mike had gotten to that point also.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Good," rich dad said softly. "Most people have a price. And they have a price because of human emotions named fear and greed. First, the fear of being without money motivates us to work hard, and then once we get that paycheck, greed or desire starts us thinking about all the wonderful things money can buy. The pattern is then set."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“很好，”富爸爸轻轻地说，“大多数人都希望有一份工资收入，之所以会这样是因为他们有恐惧和贪婪之心。先说恐惧感，没钱的恐惧会刺激我们努力工作，当我们得到报酬时，贪婪或欲望又开始让我们去想所有钱能买到的东西。于是就形成了一种模式。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“起床，上班，付账，再起床，再上班，再付账……他们的生活就是在无穷尽地为这两种感觉而奔忙：恐惧和贪婪。给他们更多的钱，他们就会以更高的开支重复这种循环。这就是我所说的‘老鼠赛跑“’。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I doubt it," said rich dad. "Instead, they feel the fear of not having money. Instead of confronting the fear, they react instead of think.

"'Then, they get a few bucks in their hands, and again the emotion of joy and desire and greed take over, and again they react, instead of think."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我想是的。他们害怕没有钱，不愿面对没钱的恐惧，对此他们作出了反应但不是用他们的头脑。”富爸爸说着拍拍我们的头。“他们会去挣了点小钱，可快乐、欲望、贪婪会接着控制他们，他们会再作出反应，仍然是不加思考。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That's correct," said rich dad. "Instead of telling the truth about how they feel, they react to their feeling, fail to think. They feel the fear, they go to work, hoping that money will soothe the fear, but it doesn't. That old fear haunts them, and they go back to work, hoping again that money will calm their fears, and again it doesn't. Fear has them in this trap of working, earning money, working, earning money, hoping the fear will go away. But every day they get up, and that old fear wakes up with them. For millions of people, that old fear keeps them awake all night, causing a night of turmoil and worry. So they get up and go to work, hoping that a paycheck will kill that fear gnawing at their soul. Money is running their lives, and they refuse to tell the truth about that. Money is in control of their emotions and hence their souls."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“正是如此，他们不去分辨真相，不去思考，只是对感受作出反应。他们感到恐惧，于是去工作，希望钱能消除恐惧，但钱不可能消除恐惧。于是，恐惧追逐着他们，他们只好又去工作，希望钱能消除恐惧，但还是无法摆脱恐惧。恐惧使他们落入工作的陷阶，挣钱——工作——挣钱，希望有一天能消除恐惧。但每天他们起床时，就会发现恐惧又同他们一起醒来了。恐惧使成千上万的人彻夜难眠，忧心忡忡。所以他们又起床去工作了，希望薪水能杀死那该死的恐惧。钱主宰着他们的生活，他们拒绝去分辨真相，钱控制了他们的情感和灵魂。”">查看中文翻译</div>
