<div class="line_en">It is Saturday night in a restaurant in downtown Chengdu, and it feels as though I have never been away. A hotpot simmers in the centre of the table, steam rising from the sea of chillies on the surface of its broth. We all have red faces. My old friends Zhou Yu and Tao Ping are roaring with laughter, as usual, at my feeble jokes. The whole restaurant is buzzing with lively social energy (in Chinese, it is 're nao' -- as hot and noisy as a marketplace). Five years or so after I first lived in Chengdu, I am back yet again, this time for three months to continue work on my Sichuanese cookbook. I have returned to my grubby worker's flat, which a few European student friends and I have kept on, paying the peppercorn rent between us, taking it in turns to live there. And I have slipped effortlessly back into my usual routine of studying in the kitchens of restaurants, reading cookery books in teahouses, and dining out with friends. So, of course, now that my father has come to visit Chengdu for the second time, this time with my mother in tow, I have done the Sichuanese thing and invited them out for a hotpot supper.</div>

<div class="line_en">Encouraged by Zhou Yu and Tao Ping, I have ticked the boxes on the order form myself, and our waitress has already stacked my chosen raw ingredients around the pot. There are rabbits' ears and goose intestines, bony little catfish, shivering sheets of ox tripe and throat cartilage, slices of luncheon meat, mushrooms of various kinds, and water spinach. I explain to my parents how to cook pieces of raw food in the broth and then dip them into the seasonings, and soon we are all tucking in. I am an assiduous host, and make sure that I give my mother and father lots of interesting things to eat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在周钰和陶萍的鼓励下，我自己在菜单上的小格子里画了勾，服务员已经把点好的菜围摆在锅边了。我点了兔耳、鹅肠、黄辣丁、毛肚、黄喉、午餐肉、菌菇拼盘和空心菜。我向父母示范怎么在锅底里煮这些生食，然后在油碟里蘸一蘸。很快我们就都举起了筷子。我是个特别尽职尽责的东道主，总想让父母多吃些有趣的东西才好。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It is only when I notice my father struggling with a rubbery goose intestine that I realise something is not quite right. He sits opposite me, a polite expression fixed on his face, crunching. Though the restaurant is noisy, I know perfectly well what is going on in his mouth. I can hear it in my mind's ear: the skid and squeak of teeth against rubberiness, the graunch of it, the sheer unpleasantness of it, for him. I realise he must be wondering, as I did half a decade before, what on earth the point is of eating these tasteless bits of rubbish, these old bicycle inner tubes. He must be wishing his horrible daughter had ordered something actually edible.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="直到我发现爸爸正跟一根韧性极强的鹅肠作斗争，才隐约感到有什么不对劲。他坐在我对面，脸上保持着礼貌的表情，嘎吱嘎吱地咀嚼着。火锅店人声鼎沸，我却很清楚他的“口舌春秋”。想象中那声音清清楚楚：牙齿咬住那橡胶一样的东西，磨来磨去，发出短促尖利的声音，非常刺耳、非常煞风景，他应该已经很不高兴了。我想他一定像五年前的我一样在想，吃这些什么味道都没有的烂东西，这些跟旧单车内胎一样的东西，到底有什么意义。他一定希望，这个不争气的女儿点了些起码能入口的菜。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It will be the same with the tripe, the rabbits' ears and the ox throat cartilage. The rabbit kidneys and bony little fish won't be much better. Glancing at my mother, my heart sinks further, because I'm quite sure she isn't enjoying them either, though she too is chewing nobly. Couldn't I at least have ordered some lean beef fillet or slices of chicken for my poor parents? What induced me to inflict such a meal on them? The answer is painfully clear: goose intestines, and the whole rubbery array of Sichuanese offal delicacies have become utterly normal to me. Or not merely normal, actually. On this occasion, as on many others, I ordered the goose intestines because I positively wanted to eat them, and I remarked earlier to Zhou Yu (something of a goose-intestine expert) how lovely and crisp they were. Oh blimey.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="毛肚、兔耳和黄喉也有同样的遭遇。兔腰子和耗儿鱼也好不到哪儿去。我瞟了眼妈妈，心更是一沉，因为我很确定她也吃得不开心，虽然她和爸爸一样在尽量高雅地咀嚼。我怎么就没能至少给我可怜的父母点一盘牛肉或者鸡丝呢？我是缺了哪根筋，要让他们遭受这么一顿饭的折磨呢？答案异常清楚：鹅肠和川菜中这一大批橡胶一样耐嚼的内脏下水，在我眼里已经十分平常了。或者说，早已超越了平常。这个场合和其他很多场合一样，我点鹅肠，是因为我很想吃。之前我还跟周钰（他算得上是鹅肠专家了）夸，说鹅肠多好吃、多脆。哎呀！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It's all very well learning to cook in China, but it's equally important to learn how to eat. You can't just waltz into a Chinese restaurant and attempt to judge the food as you might a Michelin-starred restaurant in Paris. If you do, you'll find much of it rather disgusting. Chinese gastronomy is unlike European gastronomy: it has very different criteria for the appreciation of food. I think it took me years to fully understand this. In the beginning, although I ate with great gusto, I was able only to appreciate Chinese food that resonated, at least distantly, with my own experience. Though I prided myself on my early love of the spiciness of Sichuanese cuisine, for example, and even took to the local breakfast of rice porridge served with peanuts and spicy pickled vegetables, this kind of food was hardly a challenge for someone whose mother had always cooked regional Indian for the family, and slathered her food in harissa.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="中国当然是学习烹饪的圣地，但对于欧洲人来说，学习如何吃也同样重要。你不可能就那样迈着欢快轻松的步子走进一家中国餐馆，期待着像在巴黎米其林星级餐厅一样品评其中的食物。如果真的用这种标准，你可能会觉得这些食物都非常恶心。中国和欧洲在烹饪学上有着天差地别的认知，对美食的欣赏标准也大相径庭。我也是花了很多年才完全明白这个道理的。一开始，虽然我吃起美食来兴趣盎然，却只能欣赏那些和我个人经历有共鸣的，至少要有微妙联系的食物。比如说，我固然自豪于自己很早就爱上了川菜中的香辛料，甚至习惯了当地稀饭配花生和辣泡菜的早餐；但这种食物对我来说不算什么挑战啊，因为我妈妈也经常做印度菜给我们吃，放了很多的哈里萨辣椒酱。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Yet in some senses, during those first two years in Chengdu, I was still eating as a European, because whole swathes of Chinese gastronomy remained inaccessible to me. I spent evenings politely munching my way through goose intestines and grappling with chicken's feet, but I can't say I really enjoyed them. The rubberiness, the bones and the crunchy cartilage seemed to me to be obstacles to pleasure, not the cause of it. I greeted the discovery of a clawed turtle's foot in my mouth or a bit of tripe in my rice bowl with resignation rather than relish. I ate them, of course, but it was as a favour to my friends and as a dare to myself; I would never have ordered them from a menu. Eating everything was, for me, a public declaration of intent to leave behind the treaty ports of the palate in which so many Westerners in China still lived, and venture into the gastronomic hinterland. But in my stomach of stomachs, I remained an observer, an anthropologist taking part in bizarre tribal rituals in order to learn rather than to belong.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从某种意义上来说，在成都的头两年，我一直吃得像个欧洲人，因为完全没有突破中国美食的大片“禁忌之地”。很多个晚上，我礼貌地咀嚼鸭肠、肢解鸡爪，但不能说真的很爱吃。橡胶一样的口感、乏味的骨头和咬起来咯吱作响的软骨，这些东西非但激不起我下口的欲望，反而像一个障碍，让我毫无愉悦之感。有时嘴里吃出一只鳖爪，或者饭碗里发现一片毛肚，我的态度是无欲无求地放弃，而不是有滋有味地品尝。当然，我会吃下去，但只是照顾到朋友的面子，也为了锻炼自己的胆量；我自己是绝不会点的。从前，西方在中国建了不少通商口岸，到现在还有很多外国人居住。而对我来说，什么都吃就相当于公开宣称，要放弃味觉上的“通商口岸”，冒险深入到中国美食的腹地。但我内心的最深处仍然只是个旁观者，一个“人类学家”，走进一场匪夷所思的“部落仪式”，只为猎奇了解，而非融入其中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Watching a Chinese person eat, say, a chicken's foot for the first time can be a nauseating experience. See that old woman, on a park bench, taking a spiced chicken's foot out of a paper bag. It looks like a human hand, almost, with its thin wrist and bony knuckles, but it has tight, scaly skin and long pointed toenails. The old woman puts it, feet first, into her mouth, and begins to gnaw. Her teeth, like a rodent's, strip off the skin. There is a slightly wet crunch as she bites through the cartilage of the knuckles. You can see her jaw moving as she chews them, making more little crunching noises. And then, after a while, she very delicately spits out the tiny bones and the toenails, which are perfectly clean.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="典型的英国人要是第一次看中国人吃鸡爪一类的东西，可能会忍不住吐出来。你看那个老太太，坐在公园的长椅上，从纸袋里拿出个卤鸡爪。那鸡爪看着跟人手几乎一般无二：瘦瘦的手腕、突出的骨节，但是皮很紧，是鳞片状的，还有又尖又长的趾甲。老太太把这东西一点点塞进嘴里，啃咬起来。她那啮齿动物一般的牙齿把鸡皮扯了下来。她嚼着关节处的软骨，发出有点湿乎乎的嘎吱声。她一边嚼着，你就看着她下巴在动，不断发出小声的“嘎吱嘎吱”。嚼了一会儿，她很精妙地吐出小小的骨头和趾甲，精光得没有一点儿皮肉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The main problem was texture. Texture is the last frontier for Westerners learning to appreciate Chinese food. Cross it, and you're really inside. But the way there is a wild journey that will bring you face to face with your own worst prejudices, your childhood fears, perhaps even some Freudian paranoias. It will disgust you, disconcert you, and make your compatriots view you, at times, with a scarcely disguised revulsion. Think, for a moment, of the words we use to describe some of the textures most adored by Chinese gourmets: gristly, slithery, slimy, squelchy, crunchy, gloopy. For Westerners they evoke disturbing thoughts of bodily emissions, used handkerchiefs, abattoirs, squashed amphibians, wet feet in wellington boots, or the flinching shock of fingering a slug when you are picking lettuce. Did you shudder slightly while reading this paragraph? Be honest.</div>

<div class="line_en">Aside from a few rather messy, tricky foods, like pork ribs and chicken wings, that have been enshrined as favourites by supermarkets and fast-food chains, the vast majority of Britons and Americans tend to prefer breasts and fillets that can be cut into neat pieces with a knife and fork. Fiddling around with a bony fowl's neck for the sake of a few wisps of silky meat, as the Chinese do, or working your way through a pile of small, husky melon seeds, seems like a crazy waste of time and effort.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="也有一些比较难搞、吃起来样子也不好看的食物，比如猪排和鸡翅，常年都是超市和连锁快餐店的最爱，也因此步入神坛。但大多数英美人民基本都比较偏爱胸肉或里脊肉，可以用刀叉干脆利落地切成小块小块的。西方人看着中国人拿着骨瘦如柴的飞禽脖子，费好一番功夫就为了扯下几丝纤细的肉；或者慢慢去嗑一堆小小的带壳瓜子，都会觉得真是疯了，这不是时间和精力的极大浪费吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Westerners with a particular interest in food have a much higher threshold for grapple than most people. You might find them scooping the luscious marrow out of ox bones at the St John restaurant in London's Smithfield, shucking oysters for dinner, or sucking the brains out of a langoustine's head. A willingness to tackle the more intricate ingredients has become a badge of honour, signifying the rejection of infantilised fast-food culture, with its dumbed-down eating rituals, bland tastes and pulpy textures. Such people have no difficulties with the middle ground of Chinese eating, and may enjoy, as the Chinese do, the struggles to extract and separate. Yet it takes several years of quite dedicated Chinese eating, in my experience, to begin to appreciate texture for itself. And that is what you must do if you wish to become a Chinese gourmet, because many of the grandest Chinese delicacies, not to mention many of the most exquisite pleasures of everyday Chinese eating, are essentially about texture.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有的西方人对食物特别感兴趣，所以他们的“格斗”门槛要高过大多数人。你可能会发现他们在伦敦史密斯菲尔德路上的圣约翰餐厅（2），从牛骨头里捞出甘美的骨髓大快朵颐；晚餐吸溜吸溜地吞几个生蚝，或者陶醉地吮吸海螯虾的脑髓。克服更复杂的食材去品尝美味的意愿，成了一枚荣誉勋章，象征着对低幼化的快餐文化的抵制：拒绝那些极度简化的进食仪式、平淡无奇的味道和烂兮兮软塌塌的口感。这些人接受起地道的中国饮食文化来毫无困难，可能还会和中国人一样享受这提取与分离的艰难过程。但根据我的经验，还是需要在中国“精吃”个好几年，才能真正欣赏那些独特食材的口感。如果你想成为中餐美食家，这是必经之路，因为中国的山珍海味、珍馐佳肴，无论是庙堂之上的豪宴，还是日常饮食中最精妙的愉悦，从本质上说都和口感有关。【注：（2）伦敦的一家老牌餐厅，以菜单中囊括各种各样的杂碎和内脏而闻名。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My father classifies foods according to what he calls their 'grapple factor'. Whenever my mother cooks something that is complicated to eat, like quails, or sprats, he complains, to her exasperation, about the 'high grapple factor'. Although not everyone would be so fussy about quails, most Westerners are only willing to grapple with something if it is particularly delicious. Anyone in their right mind, surely, would agree that lobsters are worth a bit of a grapple, but shell-on prawns? It's a matter of opinion.</div>

<div class="line_en">Take the sea cucumber, also known as bêche de mer or trepang. These warty, sluglike creatures spend their lives cruising the sea floor, hoovering up decaying organic material. When frightened or irritated, they shoot out sticky threads from their anuses to entangle would-be predators, or zap them with bits of digestive apparatus, which they can use as a missile and then regrow. Dried sea cucumbers are one of a pantheon of exotic dried foods that form the very pinnacle of Chinese banquet culture. In their raw state, they are dark-grey, wizened and hard, and look rather like fossilised turds. Preparing them is a laborious process. You have to salt-roast them in a wok until they are swollen and puckered, or char them black in a naked gas flame. Then you soak them in hot water until they are soft enough to be scraped clean, and slit them open along the belly to remove their viscera. What do you have after all this? Gristly, rubbery, sluggy things with a faintly unpleasant fishy taste. So you have to simmer them in stock with a little Chinese leek to remove the fishiness, and if you are a really good chef, you end up with… gristly, rubbery, sluggy things with no taste at all!</div>

<div class="line_en">Of course, by the time you actually serve them, you will have added some extravagant seasonings. In Beijing I have eaten one of the most legendary northern delicacies, sea cucumber braised with Chinese leeks. It is made with spiny sea cucumber, which looks even less appetising than the smooth kind to a European eye. Each sea cucumber costs about 200 yuan: a tidy sum with which you could easily buy dinner for a family of four. It lies on your plate in a slick of dark sauce, glistening, inescapably phallic in appearance and covered in rows of playful little spikes. The accompanying sauce is delicious, of course, but the sea cucumber itself only makes sense in textural terms, with its squelchy rubberiness, that surprising hint of crispness in the bite.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，等要端上桌的时候，肯定加了些特别奢侈的调味料了。我在北京吃到过北方最富传奇色彩的美味佳肴：葱烧海参。食材用的是刺参，用我的“欧洲眼”看去，这些东西的样子比那种光滑的还要更倒胃口。每只刺参大概两百元，都够一家四口吃顿好的了。它就那么躺在你面前盘中装的一摊深色酱汁里，亮闪闪的，让人不禁想起男性生殖器，上面还调皮地长满了小刺。当然，酱汁是非常美味的，但海参本身只有口感上的意义，咬起来“咯吱咯吱”的，很有嚼劲，竟然还有惊人的爽脆。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Chinese chefs and gourmets talk often about kou gan, or 'mouthfeel'. Certain textures are especially prized. Cui, for example, denotes a particular quality of crispness that is found in fresh crunchy vegetables, blanched pig's kidneys, and goose intestines, not to mention sea cucumbers that have been properly cooked. Cui crispness offers resistance to the teeth, but finally yields, cleanly, with a pleasant snappy feeling. It is distinct from su, which is the dry, fragile, fall-apart crispness of deep-fried duck skin or taro dumplings. Some foods, like the skin of a barbecued suckling pig, can be described as su cui because they offer both types of crispness, simultaneously.</div>

<div class="line_en">If you want to express the springy elasticity of a squid ball, you might refer to its tan xing, which also describes the bouncy aspect of that sea cucumber texture. (In Taiwan they call the same mouthfeel 'Q', or even, of foods that are very bouncy, 'QQ', in an unusual and inexplicable borrowing from the roman alphabet.) Nen is the tenderness of just-cooked fish or meat, or the fresh suppleness of very young pea shoots; hua the smooth slipperiness of 'velveted' slices of chicken. Another lovely texture word is shuang, which evokes a refreshing, bright, slippery, cool sensation in the mouth: one might use it for certain starch jellies soused in vinegar and chilli oil. Mouthfeel terms often stray over any notional border between the experiences of taste and texture: like ma, for the lip-tingling numbness of Sichuan pepper, or wei hou, 'the flavour is thick', suggesting a lingering, many-layered taste and aftertaste.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说到鱿鱼丸子这种食物，那就是“有弹性”了。海参的口感里面也有这种弹牙的拉伸感。（台湾将这种口感说成“Q”；特别有弹性的食物，就是“QQ”了，这竟然是从罗马字母中生发来的形容词。）“嫩”就是烧得恰到好处的鱼或肉，或者新鲜柔软的豆苗；“滑”就是上了浆、过了油的鸡丝；还有种很棒的口感是“爽”，指的是嘴里清新、鲜明、顺滑、清凉的感觉：比如说蘸了醋和红油的凉粉。有时候，口感游走在非常模糊的边缘，经常和味道结合在一起形容。比如“麻”，就是花椒让你的嘴巴微微发痛又麻木的感觉；或者“味厚”，就是缠绵悠长、很多层次，回味久久萦绕在舌尖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the English language, with all its expressive beauty and startling diversity, it is hard to describe the appeal of a braised sea cucumber. Try as you might, you end up sounding comical, or revolting.

In English, it all sounds like a dog's dinner.</div>

<div class="line_en">Century after century, men of letters wrote essays and poems on the pleasures of eating, like Shu Xi, of the Jin Dynasty, who penned a rhapsody on pasta; and the Tang Dynasty poet Du Fu, who waxed lyrical about the river fish of Sichuan. These famous epicures were far from unique: a passionate appreciation of food was respectable, even desirable, in the traditional scholar-gentleman. He might exercise his discernment in matters gastronomical as much as in the enjoyment of music, painting, poetry or calligraphy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="数个世纪以来，文人雅士们留下很多关于食之愉悦的诗篇。比如晋朝束皙写下的《饼赋》，是关于面团的狂想曲；唐朝诗人杜甫为四川的河鱼作了朗朗上口的诗篇。这些著名的“老饕”并不鲜见：在传统的文人君子圈里，对食物的热切欣赏是很受尊重的，甚至是不可或缺的品质。对食物的品位与品鉴力能够和对音乐、绘画、诗歌或者书法的品位相提并论。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Chinese people are generally proud of their sophisticated and sensuous culinary culture. Unparallelled in the world, it is undoubtedly one of the glories of Chinese civilisation. Yet this pride is tinged with a certain sheepishness, because of the sneaking suspicion that Chinese epicureanism and general self-indulgence have been partly responsible for the country's 'backwardness' in relation to the modern West. In the early twentieth century, the exasperation of Chinese intellectuals at the smug self-satisfaction of traditional culture helped to trigger the first revolution against the old imperial order. Later, the Cultural Revolution saw a violent backlash against the 'Four Olds': old ideas, old culture, old customs and old habits. Even today, Chinese people often remark, with a snort, that while their ancestors invented gunpowder, they simply made it into firecrackers: it was Europeans who thought of using it in artillery, which they then pointed up the noses of the unsuspecting Chinese. Similarly, as one Xi'an taxi driver moaned to me, while the Chinese realised the power of steam as a force for cookery in the Stone Age, they left it to the British to invent the steam engine.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="中国人通常都很为他们历史悠久、讲究美感的烹饪文化骄傲，毕竟这在全世界都所向披靡，也是中华文明桂冠上毫无疑义的一颗明珠。但这骄傲中似乎也掺杂了一丝怯懦，因为在全民潜藏的意识中有点怀疑中国的享乐主义和普遍的自我放纵可能是中国比起现代西方国家有些“落后”的原因之一。二十世纪早期，中国的知识分子愤而抗争，批判传统文化目中无人的骄傲自满，引发了第一场针对旧帝国秩序的革命。后来，“文化大革命”期间又开展了近乎狂暴的“破四旧”运动：破除旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯。就连今天，也有中国人会满含轻蔑地说，他们的祖先是最早发明火药的，却只做成了烟花爆竹；而欧洲人却想到了用来做炮弹，指向毫无知觉的中国人。同样的，我参观完半坡博物馆出来以后，载我的西安司机朝我悲叹，早在石器时代中国人就意识到蒸汽的力量可以用于烹饪，却生生等到英国人来发明蒸汽机。">查看中文翻译</div>

Would they have produced more outstanding chemists if they hadn't been so preoccupied with the chemical reactions taking place in the wok? Perhaps it was the abysmal diet of the British, along with cold showers and the stiff upper lip, that enabled them to establish a global empire.

<div class="line_en">After the publication of my Sichuanese cookery book, my life in China changed dramatically. The faith my cooking school teachers and my professional mentors had placed in me was vindicated. For years they had been encouraging me in my work out of sheer kindness. Now I was able to give something back. Journalists were using my book as a way into writing features about Sichuanese cuisine; travellers from countries as far apart as the United States and Korea were arriving in Chengdu and using it as a guide. I was able to travel back to China more frequently myself, to research and write articles for international publications. Best of all, I found that talented Sichuanese chefs were queuing up to show me what they could do.</div>

During my apprenticeship at the Sichuan cooking school, I dreamed of attending real Chinese banquets. I'd read about these forty-course extravaganzas. I knew they were happening around me, here and there. I could almost sniff their traces on the wind -- but they were out of the social reach of a young foreign student like me.

Born into a family of well-to-do workers, the elite class of the Maoist years, he failed a critical exam in his teens and was forced to spend five punishing years working in a factory canteen. Later, he managed to wangle a casual job in the Shufeng Garden, a well-respected Chengdu restaurant, where, by dint of sheer hard work and persistence, he was eventually promoted to the rank of chef. He went on to win gold and silver medals at national culinary contests, opened his own restaurant, and is now regarded as the enfant terrible of the Chengdu cooking scene.

The place consists just of six private rooms, furnished with traditional Chinese furniture and ceramics, which can seat a total of seventy guests.

It violates no taboos for me: I am no more offended by the scaley strips of snake or the spicy snails than I would be by a fried egg. I relish the tenderness of the pig's-brain custard that is offered to me as an off-menu aside.

<div class="line_en">In every society, cutting-edge cooking is about much more than taste. Like any art, it is a kind of cultural dialogue, rich in references to its broader context. You cannot appreciate it completely without an understanding of the themes and traditions with which it plays. Take, for example, Heston Blumenthal's Fat Duck restaurant in England. A dish such as his renowned sardines-on-toast ice cream may taste delicious, but its wit and novelty lies in the knowledge that ice cream is supposed to be a dessert, and that sardines on toast is a casual supper dish you don't expect to find in a top-class restaurant. His raw oyster with horseradish, passionfruit purée and lavender is exciting partly because of the extraordinary juxtaposition of ingredients. The familiar is shown in a different light.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="无论在什么社会，一流的厨艺都远远不止味道这么简单。和所有的艺术一样，这都是一场关于文化的对话，可以在更广阔的背景下去探索更丰富的内涵。要是你不懂菜品中展现出来的主题与传统，那就无法完全欣赏其美妙。比如，英国赫斯顿·布鲁门索的“肥鸭子”餐厅。他有道名菜叫沙丁鱼配烤面包冰淇淋，吃起来自然美味，但这道菜真正的精巧与匠心却在于，冰淇淋本来应该是甜品，而沙丁鱼配烤面包是很家常的菜，似乎不应该出现在这么高档的餐厅里。他的生蚝配辣根、百香果泥与薰衣草令人吃得激动不已，部分原因是各种食材惊人而出色的搭配。它们都是再熟悉不过的东西，经重新排列组合竟然有了全新的感受。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Yu Bo's cooking is also intended to titillate not only the tastebuds, but the mind. As his banquet takes its course, we are served with an intriguing dish of fresh, ice-cold ox-foot tendons, glossed with a mustardy, sweet-sour sauce and topped with raw salmon roe. It is a stirring textural experience, the sensuous burst of the fish eggs married with the slick chewiness of the tendons. But it is also a clever commentary on Chinese culinary tradition, because ox tendons are usually a dried food, reconstituted and then braised with rich flavourings; and raw salmon roe are a novel, Japanese-influenced ingredient. You need to know this to understand what Yu Bo is doing: the pleasure of the dish lies as much in its inventiveness as in its tastes and textures.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="喻波的菜品也正有此意，他想要撩拨的不止味蕾，还有心弦。宴席菜一道道地上，出现了一道非常有趣的菜：新鲜的冰镇牛蹄筋配芥末风味的酸甜酱，上面点缀了些三文鱼籽。真是一场口感的盛宴。鱼籽在嘴里爆开，又和牛蹄筋的滑嫩筋道神奇地结合在一起。这是对中国烹饪传统的智慧演绎，因为牛蹄筋通常是干货，泡发之后加丰富的调味料炖煮；而三文鱼籽是种受日本影响的新奇食材。这些你都要知道，才能明白喻波的真正用心：这道菜不仅味道和口感令人愉悦，其中的吐故纳新也值得赞赏一番。">查看中文翻译</div>

An English-speaking chef like Jereme Leung of the Whampoa Club in Shanghai may be able to explain to Westerners the thinking behind his food, and to promote understanding of the complexity of Chinese haute cuisine. But language difficulties and cultural barriers make it hard for others, like Yu Bo, to do likewise.</div>

<div class="line_en">Yu Bo also reworks traditional Sichuanese supper dishes, transforming them into banquet foods. A crayfish concoction plays with the flavour themes of everyday twice-cooked pork. The sublime artisan-reared pork with garlic and dried longans, or 'dragon-eye' fruit, cooked for 24 hours until the meat is almost melted, is served with miniature Sichuanese flatbreads (I am reminded of Heston Blumenthal's miniature Lancashire hotpots). It is, in terms of Chinese gastronomy, fei er bu ni: richly fat without being greasy. And one of Yu Bo's classic side dishes never fails to thrill me: a blue-and-white china jar filled with what appear to be calligraphy brushes. In fact, the brushes at the ends of the bamboo stems are made from a fine flaky pastry with hair-like folds that conceal a minced beef filling. You dip one into a china inkdish of sauce, and then pop the 'brush' part into your mouth, leaving the bamboo stem on the plate.</div>

<div class="line_en">The artistry of the finest Chinese cooking, with its subtle command of colour, aroma, taste and mouthfeel, still leaves me speechless with admiration. Those fugues on a single theme -- imagine, if you will, an entire banquet based on duck: wings, webbed feet, liver, gizzards, intestines, tongues, hearts, heads, skin and flesh, each part cooked according to its particular character! That combination of intellectual thrill with raw, sexy, sensual pleasure! Those smooth and bouncy and silky and chewy and crunchy and tender textures! Those games with hot and cold! Apply yourself to the study of Chinese gastronomic culture, and most particularly, to the understanding of texture, and whole worlds open up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最精巧的中国菜充满了艺术性，那对色彩、气息、味道与口感的微妙把控至今还让我满怀欣赏与崇拜，无法用语言表达。有些是只有一个主题的“命题作文”。比如，想象一下“全鸭宴”：鸭翅、鸭掌、鸭肝、鸭胗、鸭肠、鸭舌、鸭心、鸭头、鸭皮和鸭肉，每一部分都根据不同的特色来烹饪！富有智慧的灵感与原始的、性感的、世俗的愉悦，这是多么激动人心的结合！那些光滑的、筋道的、浓稠的、耐嚼的、爽脆的、柔和的口感啊！冷与热的纠缠游戏！要是投入到对中国美食文化的研究中，特别是去了解其中各种口感的奥妙，将有全新的世界在你眼前展开。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The only notable Western chef who gives due credit to Chinese gastronomy seems to be Ferran Adrià, the genius of El Bulli in northern Spain. He told the Financial Times journalist Nick Lander that he thought the most important political figure in cooking of the last half-century had been Mao Zedong: 'Everyone wants to know which country is producing the best food today,' he said. 'Some say Spain, others France, Italy or California. But these places are only competing for the top spot because Mao destroyed the preeminence of Chinese cooking by sending China's chefs to work in the fields and factories. If he hadn't done this, all the other countries and all the other chefs, myself included, would still be chasing the Chinese dragon.'</div>

<div class="line_en">As for myself, I can't remember any one Eureka moment when I suddenly saw the point of pure texture in food. But by the time I was ready to inflict on my poor parents, quite thoughtlessly, the revolting experience of a goose-intestine hotpot, I must have been long gone. My English values, when it came to what was disgusting and what was not, had simply disappeared: not only had I crossed the boundary into Chinese gastronomic territory, I could barely even remember where it had lain. Now I compared gristly experiences with as much delicate consideration as I might have compared the bouquets of a couple of bottles of vintage Bordeaux.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说回我自己。也不记得到底是从什么时候起，我在电光石火间发现了食物口感纯粹的意义。但在毫无考虑就让可怜的父母承受鹅肠火锅这么恶心的东西时，我在这条路上肯定已经走远了。我那些关于什么恶心、什么不恶心的英式价值观，就那么消失了：我不仅跨越中国美食的边界进入了腹地，甚至都不太记得边界在哪里了。在如今的我心里，吃软骨，大概和品尝多年波尔多陈酿一样，精妙而回味无穷。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mao Zedong may have done his best to annihilate Chinese haute cuisine, but ancient habits die hard. Since the end of the Cultural Revolution, Chinese gastronomy has been recovering something of its old vivacity.

<div class="line_en">If you are lucky enough to dine at El Bulli, you will find that in many ways Adrià's culinary explorations are proceeding along Chinese lines, with his cui seaweeds, his hua shuang exploding jelly 'olives', his su sesame-and-seaweed crackers, his endless playfulness with form and mouthfeel. Like the great Chinese chefs, he composes fugues on a single ingredient, playing with all the creative possibilities of pumpkin, coconut, or passion fruit. Dinner at El Bulli is a dance of tastes, textures, temperatures; to eat there is to eat with all the senses, as you do at a really fine Chinese banquet.</div>

<div class="line_en">My investigations took me, inevitably, to the door of the undisputed 'King of Abalone', Ah Yat, a Cantonese chef who has become an abalone celebrity across Southeast Asia (the concept of an abalone celebrity is not bizarre from a Chinese standpoint). He also has something of a global reputation, as attested by his large collection of international medals and tributes, including a 'Highest Honour Award' from the French parliament in 1997. I was taken to his Forum restaurant in Causeway Bay by a rakish food writer who was an old chum of one of my mentors: let's just call him the Gentleman Gourmet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我的调查不可避免地把我带到香港毫无争议的“鲍鱼王”阿一门前。这位香港厨子是整个东南亚的“烹鲍名人”（从中国人的角度看，“烹鲍名人”这个概念并不奇怪）。同时他还享誉全球，大量的国际奖牌与名誉就是证明，其中还有一九九七年法国议会颁发的“最高荣誉奖”。我被一个特别开朗热情的美食作家带到阿一在铜锣湾的富临酒家。这位作家是我一位导师的老朋友，我们就叫他“美食先生”好了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But if there was no single moment of conversion to the pleasures of rubberiness, there were several small epiphanies along the way. One was in Hong Kong, where I did some one-off market research for an abalone farm. Dried abalone is, of course, one of the grandest Chinese banquet ingredients, like shark's fin and sea cucumber. The finest of these sought-after shellfish come from Japan, where they are dried by a secret and mysterious method: a single large, top-class Japanese abalone can fetch the equivalent of more than £500 in a smart Hong Kong restaurant.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，虽说我不是在某一刻突然“虔诚皈依”嚼劲带来的愉悦，一路上也有些“小顿悟”的时刻。一次是在香港，我临时为一个鲍鱼养殖场做市场调查。干鲍鱼当然是中餐宴会上最昂贵奢侈的食材之一，和鱼翅、海参齐名。这些大受追捧的海产，最好的都来自日本。日本人通过秘而不宣的方法将它们做成干货：在香港比较高级的餐厅，仅一头顶级的日本大鲍鱼，价钱可能就要超过五百英镑。">查看中文翻译</div>

It would have been just another encounter with a perplexing Chinese delicacy, and I would have murmured polite approval, while secretly wondering why on earth people would pay so much for something so tough and rubbery. But now, for the first time, I understand the serious, sensual appeal of the abalone, the elusive delights of its strong and tender bite. I feel lightheaded with pleasure.</div>
