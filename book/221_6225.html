<div class="line_en">We were in the garden. Nathan was doing Will's physio, gently moving his knees up and down towards his chest, while Will lay on a blanket, his face turned to the sun, his arms spread out as though he was sunbathing. I sat on the grass alongside them and ate my sandwiches. I rarely went out at lunchtime any more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们在花园里。内森在给威尔做理疗，他轻轻地把威尔的膝盖朝胸部上下移动，威尔躺在一张毯子上，脸朝向太阳，手臂伸展开，就像在日光浴。我坐在旁边的草地上吃着三明治，现在午餐时间我很少出去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well… tonight it's a quick bout of advanced martial arts, then a helicopter is flying me to Monte Carlo for supper. And then I might take in a cocktail in Cannes on the way home. If you look up at around -- ooh -- around 2am, I'll give you a wave on my way over," I said. I peeled the two sides of my sandwich apart, checking the filling. "I'm probably finishing my book."</div>

<div class="line_en">I had spent an hour working on the calendar before coming to Granta House that morning. Some days I just sat and stared at it from my bed, magic marker in hand, trying to work out what I could take Will to. I wasn't yet convinced that I could get Will to go much further afield, and even with Nathan's help the thought of an overnight visit seemed daunting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天早上来格兰塔屋之前，我在日历上消磨了一个小时。有时候，我就坐在床上盯着日历，手里拿着神奇的记号笔，想着我可以带威尔去干什么。我还不确信自己可以带威尔去远离市镇的地方，即使有内森的帮助，想到一整夜的旅行也让我畏惧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I stood up, pocketed the money, and shoved the remains of my lunch into its brown paper bag. I was smiling as I walked away from them but, weirdly, and for no reason that I could immediately understand, my eyes were prickling with tears.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我站起身，把钱揣进口袋，把剩下的午餐塞进棕色纸袋。我笑着从他们身边走开，奇怪的是，不知为何，泪水刺痛着我的眼睛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I scanned the local paper, glancing at football matches and village fêtes, but was afraid after the racing debacle that Will's chair might get stuck in the grass. I was concerned that crowds might leave him feeling exposed. I had to rule out all horse-related activities, which in an area like ours meant a surprising amount of outdoor stuff. I knew he wouldn't want to watch Patrick running, and cricket and rugby left him cold. Some days I felt crippled by my own inability to think up new ideas.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我浏览了一下本地报纸，扫了眼足球比赛和村民游乐会。自从那次在赛马场威尔的轮椅陷入草地事件发生后，我还是有点害怕。据我所知，人群会让他觉得孤立无助。我不得不排除掉所有与马相关的活动，在我们这个地方，这些占据着户外活动的很大一部分。我知道他也不想看帕特里克跑步，板球和橄榄球会让他觉得冷。有时候，想不出新的点子让我觉得自己无能。">查看中文翻译</div>

Some quadriplegics had no sensation but, while he was impervious to temperature, below his chest Will could feel both pain and touch. I went in to see him twice, bringing him music and nice things to eat, and offering to keep him company, but peculiarly I felt in the way, and realized quite quickly that Will didn't actually want the extra attention in there.

<div class="line_en">There were codes to their discussions. I worked out that SCI was a spinal cord injury, AB the able-bodied, a UTI an infection. I saw that a C4/5 spinal injury was far more severe than a C11/12, most of whom still seemed to have use of their arms or torso. There were stories of love and loss, of partners struggling to cope with disabled spouses as well as young children. There were wives who felt guilty that they had prayed their husbands would stop beating them -- and then found they never would again. There were husbands who wanted to leave disabled wives but were afraid of the reaction of their community. There was exhaustion and despair, and a lot of black humour -- jokes about exploding catheter bags, other people's well-meaning idiocy, or drunken misadventures. Falling out of chairs seemed to be a common theme. And there were threads about suicide -- those who wanted to, those who encouraged them to give themselves more time, to learn to look at their lives in a different way. I read each thread, and felt like I was getting a secret insight into the workings of Will's brain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们的讨论中有一些代号。我查出SCI就是“脊髓损伤”，AB指“健全”，UTI指“感染”。我了解到C4 / 5的脊髓损伤比C11 / 12严重得多，后者中的大多数似乎都能使用他们的胳膊或躯体。有爱与失的故事，一方努力照顾残疾的配偶和他们年幼的孩子。有些妻子感到羞愧，祈祷他们的丈夫不再打她们——然后发现他们再也打不了了。有些丈夫想离开身患残疾的妻子，但是惧怕所在社区的反应。有疲惫与绝望，以及很多的黑色幽默——导尿管袋子爆炸的笑话，别人好意的愚蠢行为，酒醉带来的灾难。从轮椅上跌下来似乎是一个常见的主题。也有一些有关自杀的链式消息——有些人想自杀，有些人鼓励他们给自己更多时间，学会换一种方式看待自己的生活。每一条信息我都读了，我感觉这些信息让我获得了一个秘密洞悉威尔大脑中的思绪的渠道。">查看中文翻译</div>

If I could work out a way of dying with dignity, and if I didn't know it would devastate my family, I would take it. I have been stuck in this chair eight years now, and my life is a constant round of humiliations and frustrations. Can you really put yourself in his shoes? Do you know how it feels to not even be able to empty your bowels without help? To know that forever after you are going to be stuck in your bed/unable to eat, dress, communicate with the outside world without someone to help you? To never have sex again? To face the prospect of sores, and ill health and even ventilators? You sound like a nice person, and I'm sure you mean well. But it may not be you looking after him next week. It may be someone who depresses him, or even doesn't like him very much. That, like everything else, is out of his control. We SCIs know that very little is under our control -- who feeds us, dresses us, washes us, dictates our medication. Living with that knowledge is very hard.</div>

<div class="line_en">Two hours later we exited the tattoo parlour, me eighty pounds lighter and bearing a surgical patch over my hip where the ink was still drying. Its relatively small size, the tattoo artist said, meant that I could have it lined and coloured in one visit, so there I was. Finished. Tattooed. Or, as Patrick would no doubt say, scarred for life. Under that white dressing sat a fat little bumblebee, culled from the laminated ring binder of images that the tattoo artist had handed us when we walked in. I felt almost hysterical with excitement. I kept reaching around to peek at it until Will told me to stop, or I was going to dislocate something.</div>
