<div class="line_en">Away in the middle of the night a wild peal burst from the village bells, and in a moment the streets were swarming with frantic half–clad people, who shouted, "Turn out! turn out! they're found! they're found!" Tin pans and horns were added to the din, the population massed itself and moved toward the river, met the children coming in an open carriage drawn by shouting citizens, thronged around it, joined its homeward march, and swept magnificently up the main street roaring huzzah after huzzah!</div>

<div class="line_en">Tuesday afternoon came, and waned to the twilight. The village of St. Petersburg still mourned. The lost children had not been found. Public prayers had been offered up for them, and many and many a private prayer that had the petitioner's whole heart in it; but still no good news came from the cave. The majority of the searchers had given up the quest and gone back to their daily avocations, saying that it was plain the children could never be found. Mrs. Thatcher was very ill, and a great part of the time delirious. People said it was heartbreaking to hear her call her child, and raise her head and listen a whole minute at a time, then lay it wearily down again with a moan. Aunt Polly had drooped into a settled melancholy, and her gray hair had grown almost white. The village went to its rest on Tuesday night, sad and forlorn.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="日子到了星期二下午，一直挨到黄昏时刻，圣彼得堡全村仍沉浸在哀悼之中，两个走失的孩子尚无音讯。大家为他俩举行了公开的祈祷仪式。还有许多私自为他俩祈祷的人，个个诚心诚意，企望着他俩早日归来，可洞中传来的消息仍然和以前一样。大多数寻找的人都回家去各干各的事情，他们认为很显然不可能再找到那两个孩子了。撒切尔夫人病得不轻，一大部分时间烧得她直说胡话。她呼唤着孩子的名字，有时头抬起来整整有一分钟时间那么长听着，然后无力地呻吟着一头倒在床上。见此情形，大家都说真叫人心碎。波莉姨妈一直愁云笼罩，那头灰发现在几乎全都变白了。晚上整个村庄在一片悲哀和绝望的氛围里静了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Aunt Polly's happiness was complete, and Mrs. Thatcher's nearly so. It would be complete, however, as soon as the messenger dispatched with the great news to the cave should get the word to her husband. Tom lay upon a sofa with an eager auditory about him and told the history of the wonderful adventure, putting in many striking additions to adorn it withal; and closed with a description of how he left Becky and went on an exploring expedition; how he followed two avenues as far as his kite–line would reach; how he followed a third to the fullest stretch of the kite–line, and was about to turn back when he glimpsed a far–off speck that looked like daylight; dropped the line and groped toward it, pushed his head and shoulders through a small hole, and saw the broad Mississippi rolling by! And if it had only happened to be night he would not have seen that speck of daylight and would not have explored that passage any more! He told how he went back for Becky and broke the good news and she told him not to fret her with such stuff, for she was tired, and knew she was going to die, and wanted to. He described how he labored with her and convinced her; and how she almost died for joy when she had groped to where she actually saw the blue speck of daylight; how he pushed his way out at the hole and then helped her out; how they sat there and cried for gladness; how some men came along in a skiff and Tom hailed them and told them their situation and their famished condition; how the men didn't believe the wild tale at first, "because," said they, "you are five miles down the river below the valley the cave is in" -- then took them aboard, rowed to a house, gave them supper, made them rest till two or three hours after dark and then brought them home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="波莉姨妈快活极了。撒切尔夫人也差不多，等到派往洞里报喜的人把这个消息告诉了她丈夫，他也会快活到极点。汤姆躺在沙发上，周围一群热心的听者听他讲述这次历险的故事，他不时地添油加醋大肆渲染一番。最后，他描述了他如何离开贝基独自一人去探险；怎样顺着两个通道一直走到风筝线够不着的地方；然后又是怎样顺着第三个通道往前走，把风筝线全放开，他刚要返回时却看见远处有个小亮点，看上去像是日光；于是他丢下绳子，朝小亮点处摸索过去，连头带肩一起伸出小洞，看见了那宽阔的密西西比河滚滚流过。如果当时是晚上，那他不会发现亮光，更不可能走这条通道。他还讲他是如何回去，把这个好消息告诉贝基，可她说不要拿这种胡扯来烦她，因为她已经够累的了。她知道她活不长了，也愿意死去。他描述了他费尽口舌去说服她，等她摸索到能看见蓝色天光的地方，她简直高兴死了；他是怎样挤到洞外，然后帮忙把她也拉出了洞，他俩怎样坐在那儿，高兴得大喊大叫；然后有几个人是如何乘小艇经过，汤姆招呼他们，并讲明自己的处境：已经断炊。那几个人起先如何不相信这荒唐的事，因为他们讲“你们呆的山洞在河下游五英里处”——然后把他俩弄上小艇，划到一座房子处，让他俩吃了晚饭，天黑后休息了两三个小时，才把他们带回家。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The village was illuminated; nobody went to bed again; it was the greatest night the little town had ever seen. During the first half–hour a procession of villagers filed through Judge Thatcher's house, seized the saved ones and kissed them, squeezed Mrs. Thatcher's hand, tried to speak but couldn't-and drifted out raining tears all over the place.</div>

<div class="line_en">Tom learned of Huck's sickness and went to see him on Friday, but could not be admitted to the bedroom; neither could he on Saturday or Sunday. He was admitted daily after that, but was warned to keep still about his adventure and introduce no exciting topic. The Widow Douglas stayed by to see that he obeyed. At home Tom learned of the Cardiff Hill event; also that the "ragged man's" body had eventually been found in the river near the ferry–landing; he had been drowned while trying to escape, perhaps.</div>

<div class="line_en">Three days and nights of toil and hunger in the cave were not to be shaken off at once, as Tom and Becky soon discovered. They were bedridden all of Wednesday and Thursday, and seemed to grow more and more tired and worn, all the time. Tom got about, a little, on Thursday, was down–town Friday, and nearly as whole as ever Saturday; but Becky did not leave her room until Sunday, and then she looked as if she had passed through a wasting illness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="很快汤姆和贝基明白了：由于呆在洞中三天三夜，又累又饥，身体还不可能一下子恢复过来。整个星期三和星期四，他们都卧床不起，好像是越睡越困，越休息越乏力。汤姆星期四稍微活动了一下，星期五就到镇上去了，到星期六几乎完全恢复了原样，可是贝基一直到星期天才出门，但看上去很瘦，好像害过一场大病似的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">About a fortnight after Tom's rescue from the cave, he started off to visit Huck, who had grown plenty strong enough, now, to hear exciting talk, and Tom had some that would interest him, he thought. Judge Thatcher's house was on Tom's way, and he stopped to see Becky. The Judge and some friends set Tom to talking, and some one asked him ironically if he wouldn't like to go to the cave again. Tom said he thought he wouldn't mind it. The Judge said:</div>
