<div class="line_en">Jasmine Alison Viola Mayhew. She was born in the late evening of the third day of the new Millennium, and so would always be as old as the century. A neat but healthy 6lbs 6ozs, and to Dexter's mind, inexpressibly beautiful, he knew that he would sacrifice his life for her, while at the same time feeling fairly confident that the situation was unlikely to arise.</div>

<div class="line_en">That night, sitting in the low-slung vinyl hospital chair, clutching the tiny, crimson-faced bundle, Dexter Mayhew made a solemn resolution. He resolved to do the right thing from now on. A few biological and sexual imperatives aside, all his words and actions would now be fit for his daughter's ears and eyes. Life would be lived as if under Jasmine's constant scrutiny. He would never do anything that might cause her pain or anxiety or embarrassment and there would be nothing, absolutely nothing in his life to be ashamed of anymore.</div>

<div class="line_en">This solemn resolution held for approximately ninety-five minutes. As he sat in a toilet cubicle, attempting to exhale cigarette smoke into an empty Evian bottle, a little must have escaped and set off the detector, waking his exhausted wife and daughter from their much-needed sleep and as he was escorted from the cubicle, still clutching the screw-top bottle of yellow grey smoke, the look in his wife's tired, narrowed eyes said it all: Dexter Mayhew was simply not up to it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个决定的执行维持了大约九十五分钟。他坐在厕所间试图将烟吐进矿泉水瓶，却漏了一点出去，触动了烟雾传感器，警报声吵醒了此时最需要睡眠的妻女。被人从厕所领出来时，他依然攥着旋紧了盖子、灰烟腾腾的水瓶。妻了一脸倦息，迷离的眼神分明在说：德克斯特—梅休不配。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The growing antagonism between them was exacerbated by the fact that, as the new century began, he found himself without a job, or even the prospect of a job. The broadcast slot for Sport Xtreme had crept inexorably towards dawn, until it became clear that no-one, not even BMX riders, could stay up that late on a weeknight, no matter how rad, sweet or old skool the moves. The series limped to an end and Paternity Leave shaded into the less fashionable state of unemployment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有件事横耳在他们之间，恶化着双方的关系：伴随着新世纪的到来，他丢了饭碗，看不到一点工作的前景。《极限运动》的播出时间越来越无情地向凌晨后延，直至终于再没有人收看，因为在工作日，即使越野自行车手也不可能熬到那么晚——无论节目有多前卫、热烈或经典。它最终难以为继，他的产假也尴尬地转变成了失业。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A temporary distraction was provided by moving house. After much resistance the bachelor flat in Belsize Park was rented out for a huge monthly sum, and exchanged for a neat terraced house in Richmond with, they told him, bags of potential. Dexter protested that he was too young to move to Surrey, by about thirty-five years, but there was no arguing with the quality of life, the good schools, the transport links, the deer roaming in the Park. It was close to her parents, the Twins lived nearby, so Surrey won out and in May they had begun the endless, bottomlessly expensive task of sanding every available wooden surface and knocking through every non-supporting wall. The Mazda sports car went too, sacrificed for a secondhand people carrier that smelt indelibly of the previous family's communal vomit.</div>

<div class="line_en">Instead there was bickering, meanness and sullen looks through a fine haze of plaster dust. Sylvie began to spend more and more time at her parents' house, ostensibly to avoid the builders but more often to stay clear of her listless, ineffectual husband. Occasionally she would phone up to suggest that he go and see their friend Callum, the crayfish baron, and take him up on his offer of work, but Dexter resisted. Perhaps his presenting career might pick up again, he might find work as a producer or re-train as a cameraman or an editor. In the meantime he could help the builders, cutting down on labour costs and to this end he made tea and went for biscuits, picked up a little basic Polish, played PlayStation against the sonic boom of the floor-sander.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现实却是另外一番景象——口角、私心，以及泥灰漫漫中的怒目相视。西尔维越发持久地待在娘家，名义上是避开装修，实则是要回避一无是处的冷漠丈夫，偶尔打来电话，建议他去会会那位小龙虾大亨卡勒姆，接受他提供的工作机会，却遭拒绝。他还幻想着重操旧业当个主持人，也许制片人、学做摄影师、编辑也是一种选择。其间他可以帮建筑工人干活，省点开支。到目前，他煮茶、采购饼干、学了点波兰文、玩PS游戏—音乐声盖过地板磨砂机的隆隆噪声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was a momentous year for the Mayhew family, yet Dexter found himself enjoying nest-building far less than he had thought. He had imagined family life as a sort of extended Building Society commercial: an attractive young couple in blue overalls, paint-rollers in hand, pulling crockery from an old tea chest and flopping down onto a big old sofa. He imagined walking shaggy dogs in the park and exhausted but good-humoured night-feeds. At some point in the near future, there would be rock pools, fires on the beach, mackerel cooked over driftwood. He would invent ingenious games and put up shelves. Sylvie would wear his old shirts over bare legs. Knitwear. He would wear a lot of knitwear and provide for his dependents.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对梅休一家来说，这一年意义重大。不过德克斯特却发现安家的工作远不及他预想的有意思。他曾想象着家庭生活会和建房互助协会的广告片相去不远：魅力四射的青年夫妇身穿蓝色工作服，手拿油漆滚筒，从旧茶柜里拉出瓷器，然后一头扎进一张旧沙发里。他还想过牵着毛茸茸的宠物狗在公园里散步，一身疲惫却又乐呵呵地给它们喂晚餐。岩石砌成的泳池、海滩上的簿火、烤鳙鱼也不是梦。他要发明别出心裁的游戏，录成音像制品上架热销。西尔维会光着腿穿他那些宽大的旧衬衫以及针织衫。他会经常穿针织衫，也不忘给孩子们准备。">查看中文翻译</div>

He counts the boxes of the green stuff while the driver stands by with a clipboard, staring openly, and instinctively Dexter knows what's coming next.</div>

<div class="line_en">Once upon a time he had wondered what happened to all the old people in the TV industry, and now he had his answer. Trainee editors and cameramen were twenty-four, twenty-five, and he had no experience as a producer. Mayhem TV plc, his very own independent company, had become less a business, more an alibi for his inactivity. At the end of the tax year it was formally wound down to avoid accounting costs, and twenty reams of optimistically headed paper were shamefully consigned to the attic. The only bright spot came from spending time with Emma again, sneaking off to the movies when he should have been learning to grout with Jerzy and Lech. But that melancholy feeling, stepping out of a cinema into sunlight on a Tuesday afternoon, had become unbearable. What about his vow of perfect fatherhood? He had responsibilities now. In early June he finally cracked, went to see Callum O'Neill and was initiated into the Natural Stuff family.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他一度不明白电视行业的过来人后来都有何发展，如今有了答案。实习编辑和摄影师都只有二十四五岁，至于制片人，他缺乏经验。他的梅亨电视公司从来也不是一家真正的公司，只是遮掩无所事事的挡箭牌，在纳税年度结束时，它已无力承担会计成本。当初信心满满地定购的二十令办公用纸也被锁进了阁楼。生活中唯一的亮点是同爱玛在一起的时光，他逃避泥水活，溜出去约她看电影。然而有个周二，走出电影院、顶着午后阳光的时候，他的忧郁终丁一发不可收拾。他曾发誓当个好父亲，是吗？他是有责任的。六月初他终于妥协，找到卡勒姆·奥尼尔，加人了“天然食府”的大家庭。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The real head-offices of Natural Stuff are in a warehouse in Clerkenwell, fresh and clean and modern, with juicers and bean-bags, unisex toilets, high-speed internet and pinball machines; immense, Warholesque canvases of cows, chickens and crayfish hang on the walls. Part workplace, part teenager's bedroom, the architects had labelled it not an office, but a "dreamspace" in Helvetica, lower case. But before Dexter is allowed into the dreamspace, he has to learn the ropes. Cal is very keen that all his executives get their hands dirty, so Dexter is on a month-long trainee placement, working as the shadow manager of the latest outpost of the empire. In the last three weeks he has cleaned out the juicers, worn a hairnet to make the sandwiches, ground the coffee, served the customers and, to his surprise, it has been okay. This, after all, is what it's all about; business is people, as Callum likes to say.</div>

<div class="line_en">The worst thing about it is the recognition, that flickering look of pity that passes over the customer's face when they see an ex-TV presenter serving up soup. The ones in their mid-thirties, his contemporaries, they're the worst. To have had fame, even very minor fame, and to have lost it, got older and maybe put on a little weight is a kind of living death, and they stare at Dexter behind the cash register as one might stare at a prisoner on a chain-gang. "You seem smaller in real life," they sometimes say, and it's true, he does feel smaller now. "But it's okay," he wants to say, ladling out the Goan-style lentil soup. "It's fine. I'm at peace. I like it here, and it's only temporary. I'm learning a new business, I'm providing for my family. Would you like some bread to go with that? Wholemeal or multigrain?"</div>

How did he get here, he wonders, a shopping arcade in Surrey on a Saturday night? It's not even Richmond proper, just a suburb of a suburb, and he thinks once again of Suki, out on the town somewhere with her attractive girlfriends.

<div class="line_en">Soon the sun is setting and Jasmine is falling asleep on his chest as he walks briskly home down the pleasant streets to the neat little house that will be lovely when it's finished. He goes to the kitchen and without removing the sleeping baby from his sling, opens the bottle and pours a glass, his arms curled awkwardly around the bundle like a ballet dancer. He looks at the glass, almost ritualistically, then drains it, and thinks: not drinking would be so much easier if it wasn't so delicious. He closes his eyes, leans against the counter top as the tension goes out of his shoulders. There was a time when he used alcohol as a stimulant, something to lift his spirits and give him energy, but now he drinks like all parents drink, as a kind of early evening sedative. Feeling calmer, he props up the sleeping baby in a little nest of cushions on the sofa and enters the small, suburban garden: a rotary clothes line surrounded by timber and bags of cement. He keeps the baby harness on, letting it hang loose like a shoulder holster so that he might almost be an off-duty cop, homicide division, a jaded romantic, moody but dangerous, moonlighting with a little bit of childcare in Surrey. All he needs to complete the impression is a cigarette. It is his first for two weeks, and he lights it reverently, savouring that delicious first taste, sucking so hard that he can hear the tobacco crackle. Burning leaves and petrol, it tastes of 1995.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="很快便到夕阳西下，胸前裹着的贾斯敏已然睡着，他匆匆往家赶，一路感受着街道令人愉快的气息，他那别致齐整的家在装修后也会变得非常可爱。他不及放下孩子便来到厨房，打开酒瓶斟了一杯，跳芭蕾般笨拙地将手绕过襁褓，举着酒杯庄重地看着，像是在参加一场仪式，接着一饮而尽，怪它太美味，戒掉谈何容易！他闭上双眼，靠在厨房操作台上，任由双肩释放紧张。曾几何时，酒精于他是一种刺激，一种提神、提供能量的东西，如今他已无异于天下父母——它已成了夜晚的镇静剂。他心绪终于安定了些，于是将熟睡的孩子安放在沙发上那个软垫铺成的小窝里，然后走进小小的郊区庭院，置身围着旋转晾衣架的木料和一袋袋水泥之间。婴儿背带依旧松松地挂在身上，像皮枪套那般，衬得他活似一位凶杀专案组下了班的警官，疲惫一天后念想着浪漫，却又暗藏着郁闷和危险：他还在萨里郡兼职做婴儿保育工作。要是能呵根烟，这个形象便完整了。两周以来的第一支啊，他虔诚地点上，品味起来。他贪婪地吸着，都能听见烟草的噼啪声。还发散出燃烧的烟叶和汽油味，是一九九五年的味道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At the off-licence there's a tingle of anticipation as he pushes open the door and is immediately confronted by a high sheer wall of booze. Since the pregnancy there has been a policy of not keeping alcohol in the house in order to deter casual, everyday drinking. "I'm just bored of sitting on a sofa on a Tuesday night," said Sylvie, "while you get drunk alone," and taking this as a challenge he has stopped, more or less. But now he finds himself in an off-licence, and there seems to be so much great stuff here and it all looks so nice that it seems silly not to take advantage. Spirits and beers, wines white and red, he takes it all in and buys two bottles of good Bordeaux, just to be on the safe side, and twenty cigarettes. Then, because why not, he goes to the Thai take-away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="还没推开酒水店大门，他心里已激动不已。门一开，迎面一墙的酒水。自从妻子怀孕，家里就有了不存酒精饮料的规矩，免得每天都管不住自己。“每星期二下午我都一个人坐在沙发上，看着你那副醉脸，”西尔维说，“对此我忍无可忍了。”如此警告下，他总算是多少戒了酒。但既然已在酒水店，面对这么多悦目的好东西，不享受岂不犯傻？汽酒、啤酒、红葡萄酒、白葡萄酒，通通不能少，保险起见，再加两瓶上好的波尔多，此外还有二十支香烟。泰国餐外卖餐厅便在眼前，自然无妨一去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As soon as he lays her on the changing mat she wakes and starts to cry again, that awful rasping cry. Breathing through his mouth, he changes her as quickly and efficiently as he can. Part of the positive press about having a baby was how inoffensive baby poo was, how poo and wee lost their taint and became, if not fun, at least innocuous. His sister had even claimed that you could "eat it on toast", so benign and fragrant was this "poo".</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可刚把她放在换衣垫上，她就醒了，刺耳地哭起来。他张嘴喘着气，尽快为她换好尿片。当奶爸的好处之一，就是对宝宝的排泄物已不再反感。有趣纵然算不上，可到底也是没有害处的寻常东西。他姐姐甚至说：“就算烧烤了吃掉也无妨。”“宝宝便”无害，还有香味呢。">查看中文翻译</div>

Like a master safe-cracker, he is going to change her nappy without waking her up.</div>

<div class="line_en">Even so, you wouldn't want it underneath your fingernails and with the arrival of formula and solids it has taken on a decidedly more adult quality. Little Jasmine has produced what looks like a half-pound of peanut butter, which she has somehow contrived to smear up her back. With his head a little fuzzy from the wine on an empty stomach, he scoops and scrapes it up as best he can with half a pack of baby wipes and, when these run out, the edge of his one-day travelcard.

<div class="line_en">He crosses to the cot and lays her down, and she starts to scream. He picks her up and she is silent. Lays her down, she screams. He is aware of a pattern but it seems so unreasonable, so plain wrong, for her to demand so much when his spring rolls are getting cold, the wine is standing open and this small room smells so richly of hot poo. The phrase "unconditional love" has been thrown around a lot, but right now he feels like imposing some conditions. "Come on, Jas, play fair, be nice. Daddy's been up since five, remember?" She is quiet once again, her breath warm and steady against his neck, and so he tries once more to lay her down, taking it slowly, an absurd limbo dance, shifting imperceptibly from the vertical to the horizontal. He still wears the macho baby harness, and now imagines himself a bomb disposal expert; gently, gently, gently.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="来到婴儿床边，他将她放平，迎来不住尖叫，无奈地抱起来，叫声便止了。如此三番五次，折腾得他好不委屈。她怎么这么不讲理？他的春卷都凉了，酒瓶也早开了盖，房间里还充斥着恶心的味道。所谓“无条件的爱”自是挂在嘴边的，但这一刻他真想加上些条件：“拜托，贾斯，对我公平点儿，行行好吧。爸爸五点钟就起床，忙到现在了，你看见吗？”她再次安静下来，呼出温暖的气息，均匀地吹在他的脖子上，于是他再次尝试，动作缓慢如在跳一种奇怪的丛林舞蹈，身体不知不觉地从垂直转换为水平。依然戴着威风的婴儿背带的他，此刻将自己想象成了拆弹专家。要轻柔，轻柔，再轻柔。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He closes the door regardless and trots downstairs. Got to be tough. Got to be ruthless, that's what the books say. If she had some language, he'd be able to explain: Jasmine, it is necessary for both of us to have some private time. He eats in front of the television, but is once again struck by how hard it is to ignore a baby screaming. Controlled crying they call it, but he has lost control and wants to cry and starts to feel a Victorian indignation towards his wife -- what kind of irresponsible harlot leaves a baby with his father? How dare she? He turns up the television and goes to pour another glass of wine, but is surprised to find the bottle empty.</div>

He makes some more formula, then climbs upstairs, his head a little fuzzy, blood ringing in his ears. The fierce little face softens as he places the milk bottle into her hands, but then she is screaming again, a ferocious wail as he sees that he has forgotten to screw the lid on the bottle and now warm formula has flooded out and soaked the bedclothes, the mattress, is in her eyes and up her nose, and she's screaming now, really screaming, and why shouldn't she scream, given that daddy has snuck into her room and flung half a pint of warm milk in her face. Panicked, he grabs a muslin square, finding instead her best cashmere cardigan on a pile of clean washing, and wipes off the excess clots of formula from her hair and out of her eyes, kissing her all the time, cursing himself -- "idiot idiot idiot sorry sorry sorry" -- and with the other arm beginning the process of changing her formula-sodden bedding, her clothes, her nappy, flinging it all in a pile on the floor. Now he's relieved she isn't able to talk. "Look at you, you idiot," she would say, "can't even look after a baby." Back downstairs he makes more formula with one hand then carries her upstairs, feeding her in the darkened room until once again her head is on his shoulder, she is calm, is sleeping.</div>

He puts on some music, a compilation designed to make your home feel like the lobby of a European boutique hotel, and tries to read Sylvie's discarded magazine, but even that's beyond him now. He puts the games console on, but neither Metal Gear Solid, nor Quake nor Doom, not even Tomb Raider at its highest level brings him any peace.

<div class="line_en">Of course, she can't say any of this out loud. There's something unnatural about a woman finding babies or, more specifically, conversation about babies, boring. They'll think she's bitter, jealous, lonely. But she's also bored of everybody telling her how lucky she is, what with all that sleep and all that freedom and spare time, the ability to go on dates or head off to Paris at a moment's notice. It sounds like they're consoling her, and she resents this and feels patronised by it. It's not like she's even going to Paris! In particular, she is bored of jokes about the biological clock, from her friends, her family, in films and on TV. The most idiotic, witless word in the English language is "singleton", followed closely by "chocoholic", and she refuses to be part of any Sunday supplement lifestyle phenomenon. Yes, she understands the debate, the practical imperatives, but it's a situation entirely out of her control.

He holds picture books in front of her face, lifting flaps, pulling tabs, jabbing at pages saying "Duck! Cow! Choo-choo train! See the funny tiger, see it!" He puts on deranged puppet shows. A plastic chimpanzee sings the first verse of "Wheels on the Bus" over and over again, Tinky Winky performs "Old MacDonald", a stuffed pig gives her "Into the Groove" for no reason.

Relaxing Classics for Tots, part of Sylvie's total baby-mind-control project. The "Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy" sounds from tinny speakers.

Acid Jazz and break-beats, 70s funk and acid house, give way to deep and progressive house, electronica and big beat and Balearic and compilations with the word "chill" in and even a small, unconvincing selection of drum and bass. Looking through old music should be a pleasure, but he's surprised to find that even the sight of the artwork makes him feel anxious and jittery, tied up as it is with memories of sleepless, paranoid nights with strangers in his flat, idiotic conversations with friends he no longer knows. Dance music makes him anxious now. This must be it then, he thinks, this is getting old.</div>

The compilation is called "Eleven Years" and on the homemade inlay slip is a photograph, smudgy from Emma's cheap home printer, but nevertheless it is still possible to make out the two of them sitting on a mountainside, the peak of Arthur's Seat, the extinct volcano that looms over Edinburgh. It must have been that morning after graduation, what, twelve years ago? In the photo, Dexter in a white shirt leans against a boulder with a cigarette dangling from his lip. Emma sits a little distance away with her knees brought up to her chest, her chin on her knees. She wears 501s cinched tight at the waist, is a little plumper then than now, gawky and awkward with a ragged fringe of hennaed hair shading her eyes. It's the expression that she has used in photos ever since, smiling one-sidedly with her mouth closed. Dexter peers at her face and laughs. He shows it to Jasmine.</div>

<div class="line_en">And then it's The Smiths, "There is a Light That Never Goes Out", and though he never particularly cared for The Smiths he continues to bob around, head down, twenty again, drunk at a student disco. He is singing quite loudly, it's embarrassing, but he doesn't care. In the small bedroom of a terraced house, dancing with his daughter to music from a toy train, he suddenly has an intense feeling of contentment. More than contentment -- elation. He spins, and steps on a pull-along wooden dog, and stumbles like a street drunk, steadying himself with one hand against the wall. Whoa there, steady boy, he says aloud, then looks down at Jasmine to see she's okay and she's fine, she's laughing, his own beautiful, beautiful daughter. There is a light that never goes out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“史密斯”乐队的《光明永不息》响起，尽管这个乐队他一向都并不太喜欢，他还是随着旋律摇晃着，仿佛又回到了二十岁，回到了学生时代醉醺醺的迪厅。他不禁高声地唱了起来，场面固然是尴尬的，但他不在乎。在这幢小小排屋的一个房间里，伴着音乐和自己的女儿共舞，他忽然感到强烈的满足，以及欢畅。他转着圈，一脚踩在一只木玩具狗上，像街头醉鬼一样打了个趣起，手撑着墙，稳住了自己。“哇，差点栽了，小子。”他自言自语，然后低头看看贾斯敏，她没事，还在笑呢———他的小美人，漂亮的女儿。她才是“光明永不息”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And now it's "Walk On By", a song his mother used to play when he was a kid. He remembers Alison dancing to it in the living room, a cigarette in one hand, a drink in the other. He settles Jasmine on his shoulder, feeling her breath on his neck, and takes her other hand in his, kicking through the debris in an old-fashioned slow-dance. Through the middle of exhaustion and red wine he has a sudden desire to talk to Emma, to tell her what he's listening to, and as if on cue his phone rings just as the song fades. He forages amongst the discarded toys and books; perhaps it's Emma, calling back. The display says "Sylvie" and he swears; he must answer. Sober, sober, sober, he tells himself. He leans against the cot, settles Jasmine in his lap and takes the call.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着是一曲《轻轻走过》，他小时候母亲常放的歌。他还记得艾莉森一手烟一手饮料，在客厅里伴着节拍跳舞。他让贾斯敏头靠着他的肩，感觉她的气息吹在脖了上，又握住她的一只手，踏过一地的杂乱，跳起了一支老派的慢舞。在葡萄酒和疲劳的作用下，他忽然涡望和爱玛说说话，告诉她自己正在听什么音乐。似乎得到感应般，在乐声渐弱时，他的手机响起来。他在一堆玩具和旧书里翻找着。也许是爱玛回电话了。可屏幕上显示“西尔维”，他骂了一句，又不得不接。冷静，冷静，再冷静，他告诉自己。倚着小床坐下，将贾斯敏放在大腿上，他接起了电话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“她笑脒脒的，是不是，贾斯敏，我的甜心？妈吗给咱们打电话呢。”他小心地把电话放在贾斯敏耳边，她却不出声。两人都觉得没趣，于是他只好说：“下次再听她的吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In a hotel room in Westminster, ten miles further east along the Thames, his wife sits naked on the edge of a bed with the phone held loosely in her hand and quietly starts to cry. From the bathroom comes the sound of a shower running. Sylvie doesn't like what crying does to her face, so when the sound stops she quickly wipes at her eyes with the heel of her hand and drops the phone onto the pile of discarded clothes on the floor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在向东十英里外的泰晤士河下游，威斯敏斯特的一家酒店里，他的妻子赤裸地坐在床缘，无力地拿着手机，悄声哭了起来。卫生间的流水声一停，西尔维也迅速地止住哭，用手掌抹干眼泪，将手机往衣服堆上一丢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The house seems very quiet. He sits there for a full minute, his daughter sleeping now on his lap, and listens to the roar of blood and wine in his head. For a moment he feels a pulse of dread and loneliness, but he shakes this away, then stands and raises his sleeping daughter to his face, loose-limbed now like a kitten. He inhales her scent: milky, almost sweet, his own flesh and blood. Flesh and blood. The phrase is a cliché but there are fleeting moments when he catches sight of himself in her face, becomes aware of the fact and can't quite believe it. For better or for worse, she is a part of me. He lowers her gently into her cot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="房间里异常安静。整整一分钟，他坐着没动。女儿睡在大腿上。他听得到血液和葡萄酒在脑袋里轰鸣。有那么会儿，他感到一阵恐惧和孤单，却一甩头将它们赶走，然后起身抱着熟睡的女儿，她此刻四肢放松，像只小猫。他嗅到了她散发出的甜甜奶香，这是他的骨肉啊！骨肉。这自然是陈词滥调，但有时候，在那么一瞬间，他会在她脸上清晰地捕捉到自己的影子，对此他难以置信。不管是好是坏，她是我的一部分。他温柔地将她安放到童床上。">查看中文翻译</div>
