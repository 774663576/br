<div class="line_en">"Qarth is the greatest city that ever was or ever will be," Pyat Pree had told her, back amongst the bones of Vaes Tolorro. "It is the center of the world, the gate between north and south, the bridge between east and west, ancient beyond memory of man and so magnificent that Saathos the Wise put out his eyes after gazing upon Qarth for the first time, because he knew that all he saw thereafter should look squalid and ugly by comparison."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“魁尔斯是古往今来最伟大的城市。”俳雅·菩厉在枯骨之城维斯·托罗若就告诉过她。“它是世界的中心，沟通南北的门户，连接东西的桥梁，古老悠久，超越人们的记忆。它宏伟壮丽，令智者萨索斯第一眼看到它之后便自毁双眼，因为他知道今后所见的一切，与它相比都将丑陋不堪，黯然失色。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dany took the warlock's words well salted, but the magnificence of the great city was not to be denied. Three thick walls encircled Qarth, elaborately carved. The outer was red sandstone, thirty feet high and decorated with animals: snakes slithering, kites flying, fish swimming, intermingled with wolves of the red waste and striped horses and monstrous elephants. The middle wall, forty feet high, was grey granite alive with scenes of war: the clash of sword and shield and spear, arrows in flight, heroes at battle and babes being butchered, pyres of the dead. The innermost wall was fifty feet of black marble, with carvings that made Dany blush until she told herself that she was being a fool. She was no maid; if she could look on the grey wall's scenes of slaughter, why should she avert her eyes from the sight of men and women giving pleasure to one another?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹妮认为男巫说话向来添油加醋，但这座伟大城市的华丽宏伟无可否认。三重厚墙环绕着魁尔斯，墙上有各种精巧的雕刻。外墙由红砂岩砌成，三十尺高，雕刻着各种动物：蜿蜒爬行的蛇，展翅飞翔的鸢，滑行游动的鱼，还夹杂着红色荒原的狼群，以及斑马和巨象。中墙四十尺高，由灰色花岗岩砌成，雕刻着栩栩如生的战争场面：刀剑相交，矛盾互击，箭支如雨，英雄在战斗，婴儿被屠杀，熊熊燃烧的火葬堆。内墙是五十尺高的黑色大理石，墙上的雕刻让丹妮羞红了脸，但她告诉自己，别傻了，她早已不是黄花闺女；既然灰墙上的屠戮场面都吓不倒她，男女交欢的情景又有什么隐讳呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On the walls of Qarth, men beat gongs to herald her coming, while others blew curious horns that encircled their bodies like great bronze snakes. A column of camelry emerged from the city as her honor guards. The riders wore scaled copper armor and snouted helms with copper tusks and long black silk plumes, and sat high on saddles inlaid with rubies and garnets. Their camels were dressed in blankets of a hundred different hues.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹妮莉丝抵达魁尔斯时，人们在城墙上敲响铜锣通报，另一些人吹起如青铜巨蛇一般盘绕在身的奇怪号角。城内走出一队骆驼骑兵，充当她的荣誉护卫。骑手们穿着铜鳞甲，头戴镶有铜牙、披着长长黑羽的长吻盔，高高地坐在镶嵌红宝石和石榴石的华丽鞍座之上。他们的骆驼披着色彩斑斓的毯子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">All the colors that had been missing from Vaes Tolorro had found their way to Qarth; buildings crowded about her fantastical as a fever dream in shades of rose, violet, and umber. She passed under a bronze arch fashioned in the likeness of two snakes mating, their scales delicate flakes of jade, obsidian, and lapis lazuli. Slim towers stood taller than any Dany had ever seen, and elaborate fountains filled every square, wrought in the shapes of griffins and dragons and manticores.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="维斯·托罗若所缺乏的各种色彩似乎全跑到了魁尔斯，她的四周挤满了建筑物，呈现着深浅各异、如梦似幻的玫瑰、紫罗兰和棕褐色调。她经过一道雕成交欢的双蛇形状的青铜拱门，蛇的鳞片是精致的翡翠、黑曜石和天青石。无数纤细的尖塔高高耸立，丹妮毕生未见如此高大的塔楼。每个广场都有狮鹫、龙和狮身蝎尾兽形状的精巧喷泉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The outer gates were banded with copper, the middle with iron; the innermost were studded with golden eyes. All opened at Dany's approach. As she rode her silver into the city, small children rushed out to scatter flowers in her path. They wore golden sandals and bright paint, no more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="外城门镶铜，中门镶铁，内城门则镶嵌着许多黄金眼睛。这些城门随着丹妮的走近一一打开。她骑着银马进入城内，小孩子们跑出来，撒下鲜花，铺满她前进的路径。这些孩子除了金色的凉鞋，什么都没穿，全身都是明艳的彩绘。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Qartheen lined the streets and watched from delicate balconies that looked too frail to support their weight. They were tall pale folk in linen and samite and tiger fur, every one a lord or lady to her eyes. The women wore gowns that left one breast bare, while the men favored beaded silk skirts. Dany felt shabby and barbaric as she rode past them in her lionskin robe with black Drogon on one shoulder. Her Dothraki called the Qartheen "Milk Men" for their paleness, and Khal Drogo had dreamed of the day when he might sack the great cities of the east. She glanced at her bloodriders, their dark almond-shaped eyes giving no hint of their thoughts. Is it only the plunder they see? she wondered. How savage we must seem to these Qartheen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="魁尔斯人罗列于街道边，或在精致的阳台上观看——那些阳台如此精细，令人怀疑是否能支撑人的体重。他们是高挑而白皙的人种，穿着亚麻布、织锦和虎皮制成的衣服，在她的眼里，个个都是领主和贵妇。妇女的长袍露出一边胸脯，男子则偏爱镶有珠饰的丝裙。丹妮披着狮皮，肩上站了黑色的卓耿，从他们面前骑过，觉得自己粗鄙而蛮荒。魁尔斯人被多斯拉克人呼为“奶人”，因为他们肤色白皙，卓戈卡奥曾经梦想有朝一日来洗劫这些东方的巨城。她瞥了一眼她的血盟卫，从他们杏仁状的黑眼睛里看不出任何想法。在他们眼中，这些都只是未来的战利品吗？她疑惑地想。而在这些魁尔斯人看来，我们定是一群彻头彻尾的野蛮人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Pyrat Pree conducted her little khalasar down the center of a great arcade where the city's ancient heroes stood thrice life-size on columns of white and green marble. They passed through a bazaar in a cavernous building whose latticework ceiling was home to a thousand gaily colored birds. Trees and flowers bloomed on the terraced walls above the stalls, while below it seemed as if everything the gods had put into the world was for sale.</div>

<div class="line_en">"The only palace I desire is the red castle at King's Landing, my lord Pyat." Dany was wary of the warlock; the maegi Mirri Maz Duur had soured her on those who played at sorcery. "And if the great of Qarth would give me gifts, Xaro, let them give me ships and swords to win back what is rightfully mine."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我惟一想去的宫殿是君临的红堡，俳雅大人。”丹妮对男巫存有戒心，女巫弥丽·马兹·笃尔使她对操弄巫术的人心怀厌恶。“如果魁尔斯的大人物们要给我礼物，札罗，请他们赐予我舰船和军队，助我赢回理应属于我的一切吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>

They read their crumbling scrolls, drink shade-of-the-evening until their lips turn blue, and hint of dread powers, but they are hollow husks compared to those who went before. Pyat Pree's gifts will turn to dust in your hands, I warn you." He gave his camel a lick of his whip and sped away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他们曾经强盛，”札罗同意，“但如今就跟那些羸弱的老兵一样可笑，只会夸耀当年之勇，全不顾力量与技能早已离他们而去。他们阅读腐朽的卷轴，啜饮夜影之水直到双唇变蓝，口中暗示自己具有可怕的力量，但跟前人相比，他们不过是空壳子。我要提醒您，无论俳雅·菩厉给您什么礼物，都将在手中化为尘土。”他抽了骆驼一鞭，加速跑开。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The crow calls the raven black," muttered Ser Jorah in the Common Tongue of Westeros. The exile knight rode at her right hand, as ever.

"You would do well to avoid both those men, Your Grace."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“乌鸦还嫌八哥黑，”乔拉爵士用维斯特洛通用语低声说。遭放逐的骑士照旧在她的右边骑行。进入魁尔斯城之前，他收起多斯拉克服装，再度穿上板甲、锁子甲和羊毛衣——这些远在半个世界之外的七大王国骑士的全副装备。“您最好避开他们俩，陛下。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Those men will help me to my crown," she said. "Xaro has vast wealth, and Pyat Pree pretends to power," the knight said brusquely. On his dark green surcoat, the bear of House Mormont stood on its hind legs, black and fierce. Jorah looked no less ferocious as he scowled at the crowd that filled the bazaar. "I would not linger here long, my queen. I mislike the very smell of this place."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他们会助我得到王冠，”她道，“札罗拥有巨大的财富，而俳雅·菩厉——只会装神弄鬼，”骑士唐突地说。在他深绿色的外衣上，莫尔蒙家族的巨熊后腿直立，黑黝黝的，煞是凶猛。乔拉朝集市里拥挤的人群皱眉，看上去也同样凶猛。“我不愿在此久留，我的女王。我不喜欢这地方的气味。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Xaro Xhoan Daxos had offered Dany the hospitality of his home while she was in the city. She had expected something grand. She had not expected a palace larger than many a market town. It makes Magister Illyrio's manse in Pentos look like a swineherd's hovel, she thought. Xaro swore that his home could comfortably house all of her people and their horses besides; indeed, it swallowed them. An entire wing was given over to her. She would have her own gardens, a marble bathing pool, a scrying tower and warlock's maze. Slaves would tend her every need. In her private chambers, the floors were green marble, the walls draped with colorful silk hangings that shimmered with every breath of air. "You are too generous," she told Xaro Xhoan Daxos.</div>

<div class="line_en">All the great of Qarth will come to see my dragons, Dany thought, yet she thanked Xaro for his kindness before she sent him on his way. Pyat Pree took his leave as well, vowing to petition the Undying Ones for an audience. "A honor rare as summer snows." Before he left he kissed her bare feet with his pale blue lips and pressed on her a gift, a jar of ointment that he swore would let her see the spirits of the air. Last of the three seekers to depart was Quaithe the shadowbinder. From her Dany received only a warning. "Beware," the woman in the red lacquer mask said.</div>

Pyat and Xaro had showered Dany with promises from the moment they first glimpsed her dragons, declaring themselves her loyal servants in all things, but from Quaithe she had gotten only the rare cryptic word. And it disturbed her that she had never seen the woman's face. Remember Mirri Maz Duur, she told herself. Remember treachery. She turned to her bloodriders.

<div class="line_en">The thought of home disquieted her. If her sun-and-stars had lived, he would have led his khalasar across the poison water and swept away her enemies, but his strength had left the world. Her bloodriders remained, sworn to her for life and skilled in slaughter, but only in the ways of the horselords. The Dothraki sacked cities and plundered kingdoms, they did not rule them. Dany had no wish to reduce King's Landing to a blackened ruin full of unquiet ghosts. She had supped enough on tears.

<div class="line_en">When all the men had gone, her handmaids stripped off the travelstained silks she wore, and Dany padded out to where the marble pool sat in the shade of a portico. The water was deliciously cool, and the pool was stocked with tiny golden fish that nibbled curiously at her skin and made her giggle. It felt good to close her eyes and float, knowing she could rest as long as she liked. She wondered whether Aegon's Red Keep had a pool like this, and fragrant gardens full of lavender and mint. It must, surely. Viserys always said the Seven Kingdoms were more beautiful than any other place in the world.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Usurper will kill you, sure as sunrise, Mormont had said. Robert had slain her gallant brother Rhaegar, and one of his creatures had crossed the Dothraki sea to poison her and her unborn son. They said Robert Baratheon was strong as a bull and fearless in battle, a man who loved nothing better than war. And with him stood the great lords her brother had named the Usurper's dogs, cold-eyed Eddard Stark with his frozen heart, and the golden Lannisters, father and son, so rich, so powerful, so treacherous.</div>

<div class="line_en">How could she hope to overthrow such men? When Khal Drogo had lived, men trembled and made him gifts to stay his wrath. If they did not, he took their cities, wealth and wives and all. But his khalasar had been vast, while hers was meager. Her people had followed her across the red waste as she chased her comet, and would follow her across the poison water too, but they would not be enough. Even her dragons might not be enough. Viserys had believed that the realm would rise for its rightful king… but Viserys had been a fool, and fools believe in foolish things.</div>
