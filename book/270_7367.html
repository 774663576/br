<div class="line_en">I tried to get to the zipper, but I couldn't free my arms. I strained, fighting against Jacob's inert strength. Jacob muttered, still fast asleep, his arms constricting again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我试着拉拉链，但是我没办法挪动我的胳膊，我绷紧抵抗雅各布的惯性。雅各布低声咕哝着还是在酣睡，他的胳膊又收缩了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Stop it, stop it!" I yelled, scrambling awkwardly to put myself between them. The space was so small that I didn't have to stretch far to put one hand on each of their chests. Edward wrapped his hand around my waist, ready to yank me out of the way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“停下来，停下来！”我大声叫道，慌乱地爬到他们之间。空间如此之小，我根本不需要伸长胳膊把手搭在他们俩的胸口上。爱德华用他的手抓住我的手腕，准备把我拉到一旁。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The growling erupted from all around. Edward was crouching in front of me, and I couldn't see his face, but the snarls were ripping angrily out of his chest. Jacob was half-crouched, too, his whole body quivering, while growls rumbled through his clenched teeth. Outside the tent, Seth Clearwater's vicious snarls echoed off the rocks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="咆哮的声音从四面八方传了过来。爱德华蹲在我面前，我看不见他的脸，但是他的胸膛生气地起伏不定，一阵阵怒吼从中传了出来。雅各布也半蹲着，他整个身体都在颤抖，咆哮声轰隆隆地从他紧闭的牙齿缝中传出来。帐篷外面，塞思。克里尔沃特不怀好意的怒吼在岩石上回荡起伏。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Hey!" he complained, his eyes flying open. Instinctively, he flinched away from the cold, rolling onto me. I gasped as his weight knocked the breath out of me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嘿！”他抱怨道，眼睛倏地睁开了。出于本能，他躲避开冰冷的地方朝我滚过来。他的体重压得我喘不过气来，我大口地喘着粗气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And then his weight was gone. I felt the impact as Jacob flew into one of the tent poles and the tent shuddered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着他的体重消失了，雅各布飞到一根帐篷柱子上使帐篷不停地抖动起来，我感觉到他巨大的影响力。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Under my touch, Jacob began to calm himself. The shaking slowed, but his teeth were still bared, his eyes furiously focused on Edward. Seth continued to growl, a long unbroken sound, a violent background to the sudden silence in the tent.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在我的触碰下，雅各布开始让自己平静下来。他颤抖的速度慢了下来，但是他的牙齿还是裸露在外，眼睛凶猛地盯着爱德华。塞思还在咆哮，那是一声没有间断的长鸣，帐篷里陡然安静下来，他的声音因此成为一种非常猛烈的背景音。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'll just use the sleeping bag again, if you don't mind." Jacob ignored him, climbing around us and sliding into the down bag. "I wasn't quite ready to wake up. That wasn't the best night's sleep I ever had."</div>

<div class="line_en">Then both of his arms were constricted around my waist, and his lips found my ear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着他用双臂紧紧地搂住我的腰，嘴唇吻到我的耳边。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His lips gave up on mine for a moment, but I knew he was nowhere close to finished. His mouth followed the line of my jaw, and then explored the length of my neck. He freed my hair, reaching for my other arm to draw it around his neck like the first.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的唇放弃了一会儿，但是我知道还远远没到他结束的时候。他的嘴巴顺着我下巴上的线条吻下来，接着吻我的脖子。他松开我的头发，伸手拉住我另一只胳膊，把它圈在他的脖子上，就像先前那样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I shivered as I felt his teeth graze my earlobe.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的牙齿摩擦到我的耳朵让我一阵颤抖。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I shook my head mechanically until one of his hands wound back into my hair and stopped me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我机械地摇摇头，直到他的一只手绕过我的头发制止了我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His voice turned acidic. "Are you sure you want me to come back? Or did you really want me to die?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的声音变得酸溜溜的：“你确定想让我回来吗？或者你真的想让我死？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Anger rocked through me like the whiplash after a heavy punch. That was too much -- he wasn't fighting fair.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="气愤涌遍我的全身，就像鞭子狠狠地抽过一样，那太过分了——他没有公平竞争。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You can do better than this, Bella," he whispered huskily. "You're overthinking it."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“贝拉，你可以做得更好的，”他沙哑地低语道，“你仔细想一想。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"That's right," he murmured. "For once, just let yourself feel what you feel."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那就对了，”他咕哝道，“就一次，让自己感受你想要的感觉。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My arms were already around his neck, so I grabbed two fistfuls of his hair -- ignoring the stabbing pain in my right hand -- and fought back, struggling to pull my face away from his.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我的胳膊已经圈住他的脖子，所以我抓住两把他的头发——没理会右手上的刺痛——反击回去，挣扎着把我的脸从他那里移开。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">With a wild gasp, he brought his mouth back to mine, his fingers clutching frantically against the skin at my waist.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他大大地吸了一口气，他重新吻住我的唇，手指疯狂地抓住我腰上的皮肤。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was too strong to recognize that my hands, trying to yank his hair out by the roots, meant to cause him pain. Instead of anger, he imagined passion. He thought I was finally responding to him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他太强悍了，因而意识不到我的手想要把他的头发连根拔起，是想要让他疼痛一下。他想到的不是生气，而是激情，他以为我终于开始对他有反应了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The jolt of anger unbalanced my tenuous hold on self-control; his unexpected, ecstatic response overthrew it entirely. If there had been only triumph, I might have been able to resist him. But the utter defenselessness of his sudden joy cracked my determination, disabled it. My brain disconnected from my body, and I was kissing him back. Against all reason, my lips were moving with his in strange, confusing ways they'd never moved before -- because I didn't have to be careful with Jacob, and he certainly wasn't being careful with me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="愤怒狠狠地击打着我，使我自己脆弱的自控失去平衡；他突然欣喜若狂的回应把它完全颠覆了。要是那只是胜利的话，我很可能会抗拒的，但是我对他突如其来的喜悦完全没有设防，它击溃了我的决心，使之不再起作用。我的大脑与我的身体脱离，我开始回吻着他。违背所有的理性，我的嘴唇在他的上面游移，那是一种陌生、令人迷惑的感觉，我以前从来没有经历过——因为我不必对雅各布小心翼翼，他当然也不会对我谨小慎微。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was everywhere. The piercing sunlight turned my eyelids red, and the color fit, matched the heat. The heat was everywhere. I couldn't see or hear or feel anything that wasn't Jacob.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他无所不在，刺眼的阳光使我的眼睑变成红色，这种颜色很合适，与这里的热量很匹配，热量无所不在。我看不见，也听不见，也感觉不到雅各布之外的任何事情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My fingers tightened in his hair, but I was pulling him closer now.</div>

<div class="line_en">The questions were stupid, because I knew the answer: I'd been lying to myself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些问题很愚蠢，因为我知道答案，我一直在自欺欺人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Why wasn't I stopping this? Worse than that, why couldn't I find in myself even the desire to want to stop? What did it mean that I didn't want him to stop? That my hands clung to his shoulders, and liked that they were wide and strong? That his hands pulled me too tight against his body, and yet it was not tight enough for me?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="为什么我不制止这样？更糟糕的是，为什么我发现自己甚至找不到想要制止的欲望？我不想让他停下来这意味着什么？我的双手紧紧地握着他的肩膀，喜欢它们宽阔而强壮？他的手紧紧地拉着我靠近他，然而这对我而言还不够紧？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The tiny piece of my brain that retained sanity screamed questions at me.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jacob was right. He'd been right all along. He was more than just my friend. That's why it was so impossible to tell him goodbye -- because I was in love with him. Too. I loved him, much more than I should, and yet, still nowhere near enough. I was in love with him, but it was not enough to change anything; it was only enough to hurt us both more. To hurt him worse than I ever had.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="雅各布是对的，他一直都是正确的。他不仅仅是朋友，对他说再见是那么不可能，就是因为这一点——因为他爱我，我也爱他。我爱他，超过了我应该保持的界限，尽管缺如此，这还远远不够。我爱他，但这不足以改变任何事情；这只会带给我们更多伤害，比我之前伤害他更深。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I didn't care about more than that -- than his pain. I more than deserved whatever pain this caused me. I hoped it was bad. I hoped I would really suffer.</div>

<div class="line_en">For one brief, never-ending second, an entirely different path expanded behind the lids of my tear-wet eyes. As if I were looking through the filter of Jacob's thoughts, I could see exactly what I was going to give up, exactly what this new self-knowledge would not save me from losing. I could see Charlie and Renee mixed into a strange collage with Billy and Sam and La Push. I could see years passing, and meaning something as they passed, changing me. I could see the enormous red-brown wolf that I loved, always standing as protector if I needed him. For the tiniest fragment of that second, I saw the bobbing heads of two small, black-haired children, running away from me into the familiar forest. When they disappeared, they took the rest of the vision with them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在短暂而又无止尽的一秒钟里，一条完全不同的道路在我热泪满盈的眼眶里扩展开来。好像我看透了雅各布思想的滤网，能够清清楚楚地看见我要放弃的东西，这层新的自我认识会使我什么都不必失去。我能看见查理、蕾妮与比利，山姆和拉普西奇怪地融合在一起。我能看见许多年过去了，随着时间的流逝意味着什么，也改变了我。我能看见我爱的红棕色狼，总是在我需要的时候以保护者的身份站在我身边。就是那一秒钟最微小的片段里，我看见两个小小的黑头发的小孩，他们轻轻的摆动着脑袋，从我身边跑开，跑进熟悉的森林里，他们消失的时候把幻影也一起带走了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In this moment, it felt as though we were the same person. His pain had always been and would always be my pain -- now his joy was my joy. I felt joy, too, and yet his happiness was somehow also pain. Almost tangible -- it burned against my skin like acid, a slow torture.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在这一刻，我们就像是同一个人一样。他的痛苦一直是，而且永远都是我的痛苦——现在他的快乐就是我的快乐。我也感到欣喜，然而他的幸福不知为何也是痛苦。几乎触手可及——就像酸液一样在我的皮肤上燃烧，是一种慢慢的折磨。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He smiled, pleased by my response. "I won't be long," he promised. "But one thing first…"</div>
