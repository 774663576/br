<div class="line_en">After they had ridden for several hours down the valley, it widened out and they could see what was ahead of them. The river which they had been following here joined a broader river, wide and turbulent, which flowed from their left to their right, towards the east. Beyond this new river a delightful country rose gently in low hills, ridge beyond ridge, to the Northern Mountains themselves. To the right there were rocky pinnacles, one or two of them with snow clinging to the ledges. To the left, pine-clad slopes, frowning cliffs, narrow gorges, and blue peaks stretched away as far as the eye could reach. He could no longer make out Mount Pire. Straight ahead the mountain range sank to a wooded saddle which of course must be the pass from Archenland into Narnia.</div>

<div class="line_en">The eastern-flowing river, which was pouring from the higher mountains at the western end of the range, was far too swift and too broken with rapids for them to think of swimming it; but after some casting about, up and down the bank, they found a place shallow enough to wade. The roar and clatter of water, the great swirl against the horses' fetlocks, the cool, stirring air and the darting dragon-flies, filled Shasta with a strange excitement.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="向东流去的大河是从西端的高山上倾泻而下的，奔腾得太快，被湍滩打断之处太多，他们不敢游过去，在岸上来来回回几番焦急地寻找，终于找到一个浅浅的可以涉水而过的地方。哗啦哗啦的水声，冲在马蹄茸毛上的旋涡，清凉、动荡的空气，飞来飞去的蜻蜓，都使沙斯塔心里充满了新奇的激动之情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Friends, we are in Archenland!" said Bree proudly as he splashed and churned his way out on the Northern bank. "I think that river we've just crossed is called the Winding Arrow."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“朋友们，咱们进入阿钦兰了！”布里溅泼着水、摇摇晃晃爬上北岸时，自豪地说道，”我想我们刚才渡过的河流叫做旋箭河。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我希望我们及时赶到了。”赫温喃喃说道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then they began going up, slowly and zigzagging a good deal, for the hills were steep. It was all open park-like country with no roads or houses in sight. Scattered trees, never thick enough to be a forest, were everywhere. Shasta, who had lived all his life in an almost tree-less grassland, had never seen so many or so many kinds. If you had been there you would probably have known (he didn't) that he was seeing oaks, beeches, silver birches, rowans, and sweet chestnuts. Rabbits scurried away in every direction as they advanced, and presently they saw a whole herd of fallow deer making off among the trees.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是他们开始攀登而上，走得很慢，曲曲折折，因为小山很陡。这是空旷的、公园似的乡野，看不见道路和房子。疏疏朗朗的树木到处都是，可总是没有密集到蔚然成林的。沙斯塔一向住在一个几乎没有树木的草原上，从未看见过这么多的树，这么多各种各样的树，如果你也在那儿，你就可能知道（他可不知道），他正瞧见橡树、山毛棒、白桦、花楸、栗子树哩。他们前进时，野兔向四面八方乱窜，不久他们又看见一大群黄棕色黄占鹿从林木之间逃逸而去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The race was very gruelling for the Horses. As they topped each ridge they found another valley and another ridge beyond it; and though they knew they were going in more or less the right direction, no one knew how far it was to Anvard. From the top of the second ridge Shasta looked back again. Instead of a dust-cloud well out in the desert he now saw a black, moving mass, rather like ants, on the far bank of the Winding Arrow. They were doubtless looking for a ford.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对马儿来说，这是一场极度紧张的竞赛。它们到每个山脊的顶上时，总是发现前面还有山谷或山脊，虽然它们知道自己走的是大致正确的方向，却不知道离安瓦德还有多远。沙斯塔在第二个山脊上回头望去，现在看到的不是从大沙漠里冒起来的一股尘烟，而是一团黑魁魁的东西，倒有点儿像蚂蚁，正在叫做”盘旋的箭”的河岸上蠕动。毫无疑问，他们是在寻找可以涉水而过的地方。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At that moment everyone's feelings were completely altered by a sound from behind. It was not the sound they had been expecting to hear -- the noise of hoofs and jingling armour, mixed, perhaps, with Calormene battle-cries. Yet Shasta knew it at once. It was the same snarling roar he had heard that moonlit night when they first met Aravis and Hwin. Bree knew it too. His eyes gleamed red and his ears lay flat back on his skull. And Bree now discovered that he had not really been going as fast -- not quite as fast -- as he could. Shasta felt the change at once. Now they were really going all out. In a few seconds they were well ahead of Hwin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在这关键时刻，大家的感觉都被背后的吼声完全改变了。这不是他们意料中的声音——马蹄嘚嘚声和盔甲丁当声，或者还夹杂着卡乐门人挑战的呐喊声。然而沙斯塔立刻听出来这是什么声音了。他们在月明之夜第一次遇见阿拉维斯和赫温时，听到的是同样的咆哮声。布里也立刻明白了。它的眼睛发亮，它的两个耳往后平贴在脑袋上。布里这时才发现，它并未确确实实地尽最大的力量快跑——跑得并不太快。现在可真的使足劲儿飞跑了。不出几秒钟，它就超过赫温好多了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was all Shasta could do to prevent himself from shouting out similar instructions; but he thought, "The poor chap's doing all he can already," and held his tongue. And certainly both Horses were doing, if not all they could, all they thought they could; which is not quite the same thing. Bree had caught up with Hwin and they thundered side by side over the turf. It didn't look as if Hwin could possibly keep it up much longer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="沙斯塔能做的，只有克制自己，不要叫出类似的指示，他心里想”这可怜的家伙已经把它所有的力气都使出来了。”但他没有说出口来。而这两匹马儿，如果不是竭尽全力，也都自以为竭尽全力了——这两者可不是一回事。布里已经追上赫温，它们并驾齐驱地隆隆驰过草根土。看来赫温不可能这样坚持多久了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Quick! Quick!" shouted Aravis. "We might as well not have come at all if we don't reach Anvard in time. Gallop, Bree, gallop. Remember you're a war-horse."</div>

<div class="line_en">He looked forward again and saw something which he did not take in, or even think about. Their way was barred by a smooth green wall about ten feet high. In the middle of that wall there was a gate, open. In the middle of the gateway stood a tall man dressed, down to his bare feet, in a robe coloured like autumn leaves, leaning on a straight staff. His beard fell almost to his knees.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他向前看看，瞧到了他没注意甚至没想到的事情。他们前进的道路被一道十英尺高的平整的绿色墙垣挡住了。墙垣的中间有个大门，洞开着。门里站着一个身材高大的人，赤脚穿一件秋叶色长袍，身子斜靠在一根笔直的手杖上。他的胡须很长，几乎下垂到膝头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's not fair," thought Shasta. "I did think we'd be safe from lions here!"</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="沙斯塔一眼便看到了这一切，他重新回过头去望。狮子现在几乎要抓住赫温了。狮子正在向赫温的后腿扑呀扑的，此刻赫温汗迹斑斑、两眼圆睁的脸上已经露出绝望的神色。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One of the most terrible noises in the world, a horse's scream, broke from Hwin's lips. Aravis was stooping low over Hwin's neck and seemed to be trying to draw her sword. And now all three -- Aravis, Hwin, and the lion were almost on top of Shasta. Before they reached him the lion rose on its hind legs, larger than you would have believed a lion could be, and jabbed at Aravis with its right paw. Shasta could see all the terrible claws extended. Aravis screamed and reeled in the saddle. The lion was tearing her shoulders. Shasta, half mad with horror, managed to lurch towards the brute. He had no weapon, not even a stick or a stone. He shouted out, idiotically, at the lion as one would at a dog. "Go home! Go home!" For a fraction of a second he was staring right into its wideopened, raging mouth. Then, to his utter astonishment, the lion, still on its hind legs, checked itself suddenly, turned head over heels, picked itself up, and rushed away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="世界上最最可怕的声音，一匹马儿的哀鸣，从赫温的嘴里迸发出来了。阿拉维斯正俯下身来伏在赫温的脖子上，似乎企图拔出刀来。如今她们三个——阿拉维斯、赫温和狮子，几乎就在沙斯塔的头顶之上。她们尚未靠近他，那狮子便用后腿站了起来（它躯体之巨大，你简直没法儿相信），伸出前腿的右爪，猛扑阿拉维斯。沙斯塔看得见那伸开来的所有爪子。阿拉维斯尖声叫喊，在马鞍上摇摇晃晃。狮子在扯她的肩膀。沙斯塔惊惶得半疯半癫，设法向那野兽扑过去。他没有武器，连一根木棒或一块石头也没有。他傻瓜似的向狮子大喊，仿佛人们冲狗儿叫喊一样。”回家去！回家去！”在一秒钟不到的时间里，他瞪眼望着那张得大大的、凶猛的狮子嘴巴。接着，却使他诧异之至，那仍旧用后腿站着的狮子，突然克制自己，变得俯首贴地了，它随即抬起身子，迅速跑掉了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Shasta slipped his feet out of the stirrups, slid both his legs over the left side, hesitated for one hideous hundredth of a second, and jumped. It hurt horribly and nearly winded him; but before he knew how it hurt him he was staggering back to help Aravis. He had never done anything like this in his life before and hardly knew why he was doing it now.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I who know many present things by my art," replied the Hermit with a smile, "have yet little knowledge of things future. Therefore I do not know whether any man or woman or beast in the whole world will be alive when the sun sets tonight. But be of good hope. The damsel is likely to live as long as any of her age."</div>

<div class="line_en">When Aravis came to herself she found that she was lying on her face on a low bed of extraordinary softness in a cool, bare room with walls of undressed stone. She couldn't understand why she had been laid on her face; but when she tried to turn and felt the hot, burning pains all over her back, she remembered, and realized why. She couldn't understand what delightfully springy stuff the bed was made of, because it was made of heather (which is the best bedding) and heather was a thing she had never seen or heard of.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿拉维斯苏醒过来时，发觉她正俯卧在一张特别柔软的床上，房间内什么陈设也没有，石头墙也是未经雕琢的、粗糙的。她不明白为什么安排她俯卧；但当她要想翻身而感觉到整个背部灼热发烫、十分疼痛时，她记起来了，明白了非得俯卧不可的缘故。她不明白这床是用什么舒适而有弹性的材料做的，因为这床是用石南荒原草（最好的垫褥）做成的，而她从未见过或听说过这种草。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The door opened and the Hermit entered, carrying a large wooden bowl in his hand. After carefully setting this down, he came to the bedside, and asked:</div>

<div class="line_en">He fetched the wooden bowl and held it to her lips. Aravis couldn't help making a face when she tasted it, for goats' milk is rather a shock when you are not used to it. But she was very thirsty and managed to drink it all and felt better when she had finished.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他拿起木碗，送到她的唇边。她喝下去时不由得做了个鬼脸，因为羊奶还没有喝惯时总是叫人害怕的。她很口渴，设法把那碗羊奶都喝下去了，喝完时，觉得好多了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“女儿啊，”隐士说道，”我在这个世界上活了一百零九个春秋了，可从来不曾碰到过什么类似运气的东西。在这一切里，有些东西我不理解，但如果我们确实需要弄明白的话，你不妨深信不疑，我们一定会弄明白的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

Ten scratches: sore, but not deep or dangerous."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“听着，女儿，你想睡时不妨睡睡，”隐士说道，”因为你的伤口洗过了，敷了药，包裹好了，伤口虽然疼痛，可不比鞭打后的伤痕严重。这必定是一头十分奇怪的狮子，它并没有用牙齿咬到你的肉里，把你从马鞍子上叼下来，只是用爪子在你背上挠了一下。十道伤痕，痛，可是不深，不危险。”">查看中文翻译</div>

"My good Horse, you've lost nothing but your self-conceit. No, no, cousin. Don't put back your ears and shake your mane at me. If you are really so humbled as you sounded a minute ago, you must learn to listen to sense. You're not quite the great Horse you had come to think, from living among poor dumb horses. Of course you were braver and cleverer than them. You could hardly help being that. It doesn't follow that you'll be anyone very special in Narnia. But as long as you know you're nobody special, you'll be a very decent sort of Horse, on the whole, and taking one thing with another. And now, if you and my other four-footed cousin will come round to the kitchen door we'll see about the other half of that mash."</div>
