<div class="line_en">Once, he arrived early and made it to the front door. I stammered nervously as I introduced him to Mother, who was blending bergamot and ylang-ylang, clicking her fingers to test the proportions. She said hello but her fingers kept pulsing. When Charles looked at me as if to ask why, Mother explained that God was speaking through her fingers. "Yesterday I tested that I'd get a migraine today if I didn't have a bath in lavender," she said. "I took the bath and guess what? No headache!"</div>

<div class="line_en">I couldn't reconcile his world with mine so I separated them. Every evening I watched for his red jeep from my window, and when it appeared on the highway I ran for the door. By the time he'd bumped up the hill I'd be waiting on the lawn, and before he could get out I'd be in the jeep, arguing with him about my seatbelt. (He refused to drive unless I wore one.)</div>

<div class="line_en">Charles was my first friend from that other world, the one my father had tried to protect me from. He was conventional in all the ways and for all the reasons my father despised conventionality: he talked about football and popular bands more than the End of Days; he loved everything about high school; he went to church, but like most Mormons, if he was ill, he was as likely to call a doctor as a Mormon priest.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dad said I was becoming "uppity." He didn't like that I rushed home from the junkyard the moment the work was finished, or that I removed every trace of grease before going out with Charles. He knew I'd rather be bagging groceries at Stokes than driving the loader in Blackfoot, the dusty town an hour north where Dad was building a milking barn. It bothered him, knowing I wanted to be in another place, dressed like someone else.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爸爸说我变得“自命不凡”。他不喜欢我一干完活儿就匆忙离开废料场往家赶，也不喜欢我在和查尔斯外出之前把所有油污的痕迹都洗掉。他知道，我宁愿在斯托克斯商店包装杂货，也不愿去布莱克富特开装载机。布莱克富特是北部一小时路程的地方一个尘土飞扬的小镇，爸爸在那里建造牛奶仓库。他知道我想去别的地方，想穿得和别人一样，这让他颇为恼火。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You must have smelled it," he said. "It was strong. I've smelled it before. On you. You always smell of it. Hell, I probably do, too, now." He sniffed his shirt. I was quiet. I hadn't smelled anything.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你一定闻到了，”他说，“味道浓烈。我以前闻到过。你身上一直有这股味道。见鬼，现在我身上可能也有这个味儿了。”他嗅了嗅衬衫。我很安静。我什么都没闻到。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On the site in Blackfoot, he dreamed up strange tasks for me to do, as if he thought my doing them would remind me who I was. Once, when we were thirty feet in the air, scrambling on the purlins of the unfinished roof, not wearing harnesses because we never wore them, Dad realized that he'd left his chalk line on the other side of the building. "Fetch me that chalk line, Tara," he said. I mapped the trip. I'd need to jump from purlin to purlin, about fifteen of them, spaced four feet apart, to get the chalk, then the same number back. It was exactly the sort of order from Dad that was usually met with Shawn saying, "She's not doing that."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在布莱克富特镇的工地，他给我安排了一些奇怪的任务，好像他觉得做这些工作就会让我记起自己是谁。有一次，我们正悬在三十英尺的高空，爬上尚未完工的屋檩，没有系安全绳，因为我们从来不系。爸爸想起他将粉笔线落在了另一边。“把粉笔线给我拿来，塔拉。”他说。我估摸了一下行程。我需要翻过一根根檩条——大概有十五根，每两条间距四英尺——才能拿到粉笔线，然后原路返回，还得走过那些檩条。通常肖恩听见父亲这样的命令，会说：“别让她做那个。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That was how Dad and Shawn became comrades, even if they only agreed on one thing: that my brush with education had made me uppity, and that what I needed was to be dragged through time. Fixed, anchored to a former version of myself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就这样爸爸和肖恩成了同志，尽管他们只在一件事上达成了共识：上学让我变得自命不凡，我需要被慢慢拉回从前，被调教一番，变回过去的样子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You can fetch it," Shawn said. "Unless your fancy school and fancy boyfriend have made you too good for it." His features hardened in a way that was both new and familiar.</div>

<div class="line_en">Shawn had a gift for language, for using it to define others. He began searching through his repertoire of nicknames. "Wench" was his favorite for a few weeks. "Wench, fetch me a grinding wheel," he'd shout, or "Raise the boom, Wench!" Then he'd search my face for a reaction. He never found one. Next he tried "Wilbur." Because I ate so much, he said. "That's some pig," he'd shout with a whistle when I bent over to fit a screw or check a measurement.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我摇摇晃晃地上了一根檩条，来到仓库边缘的框架梁上。从某种意义上来说这样更危险——如果我倒向右侧，没有檩条接着——但框架梁很粗，我可以像走钢丝一样走过去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Shawn took to lingering outside after the crew had finished for the day. I suspect he wanted to be near the driveway when Charles drove up it. He seemed to be forever changing the oil in his truck. The first night he was out there, I ran out and jumped into the jeep before he could say a word. The next night he was quicker on the draw. "Isn't Tara beautiful?" he shouted to Charles. "Eyes like a fish and she's nearly as smart as one." It was an old taunt, blunted by overuse. He must have known I wouldn't react on the site so he'd saved it, hoping that in front of Charles it might still have sting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小工队结束了一天的工作后，肖恩开始在外面逗留。我怀疑他是想趁查尔斯开车过来时靠近车道。他总是装作在给自己的卡车更换机油。他在外面的第一晚，我跑出去，不等他说一个字便跳上吉普车。第二晚，他出手更迅速。“塔拉很美对吗？”他对查尔斯喊道，“眼睛像鱼一样，她几乎和鱼一样聪明。”这是一句嘲讽的老话，用了太多次，我都麻木了。他一定知道在工地说这句话我不会有任何反应，所以他偏当着查尔斯的面说，希望能刺痛我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Charles never responded. We entered into an unspoken agreement to begin our evenings the moment the mountain disappeared in the rearview mirror. In the universe we explored together there were gas stations and movie theaters; there were cars dotting the highway like trinkets, full of people laughing or honking, always waving, because this was a small town and everybody knew Charles; there were dirt roads dusted white with chalk, canals the color of beef stew, and endless wheat fields glowing bronze. But there was no Buck's Peak.</div>

<div class="line_en">During the day, Buck's Peak was all there was -- that and the site in Blackfoot. Shawn and I spent the better part of a week making purlins to finish the barn roof. We used a machine the size of a mobile home to press them into a Z shape, then we attached wire brushes to grinders and blasted away the rust so they could be painted. When the paint was dry we stacked them next to the shop, but within a day or two the wind from the peak had covered them in black dust, which turned to grime when it mixed with the oils on the iron. Shawn said they had to be washed before they could be loaded, so I fetched a rag and a bucket of water.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then the world had turned upside down: I had entered a university, where I'd wandered into an auditorium and listened, eyes wide, mind buzzing, to lectures on American history. The professor was Dr. Richard Kimball, and he had a resonant, contemplative voice. I knew about slavery; I'd heard Dad talk about it, and I'd read about it in Dad's favorite book on the American founding. I had read that slaves in colonial times were happier and more free than their masters, because the masters were burdened with the cost of their care. That had made sense to me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着世界发生了天翻地覆的变化：我进入一所大学，在那里我漫步走进一间礼堂，听了一场关于美国历史的讲座，它让我睁大双眼，思绪万千。讲课的教授是理查德·金伯尔博士，他声音洪亮，引人深思。我对奴隶制略知一二；我听爸爸谈起过，也在爸爸最喜欢的关于美国建国的书中读到过。我读到过，殖民时期的奴隶比他们的主人更幸福、更自由，因为主人还要负担照顾他们的费用。我当时觉得颇有道理。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The summer shawn and I had worked the Shear, there'd been an afternoon when I'd wiped the sweat from my face so many times that, by the time we quit for supper, my nose and cheeks had been black. That was the first time Shawn called me "Nigger." The word was suprising but not unfamiliar. I'd heard Dad use it, so in one sense I knew what it meant. But in another sense, I didn't understand it as meaning anything at all. I'd only ever seen one black person, a little girl, the adoptive daughter of a family at church. Dad obviously hadn't meant her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那年夏天我和肖恩一起操纵大剪刀。有一天下午，由于我多次擦拭脸上的汗，等到我们歇工吃晚饭时，我的鼻子和脸颊全黑了。那是肖恩第一次叫我“黑鬼”。我很惊讶，但并不感到陌生。我听爸爸用过这个词，所以从某种意义上来说我知道它的意思。但从另一种意义上，我完全不理解它的含义。我只在教堂见过一个黑人，是个小女孩，某户人家的养女。爸爸显然不是在说她。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The day Dr. Kimball lectured on slavery, he filled the overhead screen with a charcoal sketch of a slave market. The screen was large; as in a movie theater it dominated the room. The sketch was chaotic. Women stood, naked or half naked, and chained, while men circled them. The projector clacked. The next image was a photograph, black and white and blurred with age. Faded and overexposed, the image is iconic. In it a man sits, stripped above the waist, exposing for the camera a map of raised, crisscrossing scars. The flesh hardly looks like flesh, from what has been done to it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="金伯尔博士讲授奴隶制那天，他头顶的屏幕上是一幅关于奴隶市场的炭笔素描。屏幕很大，就像电影院的屏幕一样，占据了整个房间。画上是一片混乱的场面。女人们站着，全裸或半裸，被锁链锁着，被男人们团团围住。投影机咔嗒一声，切换到下一张黑白照片，照片因为年代久远而有些模糊不清。褪色和过度曝光，让这张照片很有象征性。照片上，一个人面对镜头坐着，上身赤裸，露出地图般纵横交错的凸起的伤疤。遭受的凌辱让他身上的肉看上去不再像肉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I saw many more images in the coming weeks. I'd heard of the Great Depression years before when I'd played Annie, but the slides of men in hats and long coats lined up in front of soup kitchens were new to me. When Dr. Kimball lectured on World War II, the screen showed rows of fighter planes interspersed with the skeletal remains of bombed cities. There were faces mixed in -- FDR, Hitler, Stalin. Then World War II faded with the lights of the projector.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接下来的几周，我见到了更多的照片。几年前我扮演安妮时就听说过经济大萧条，但幻灯片上戴着帽子、穿着长外套、排着长队站在施粥所前的人们还是让我感到新鲜。金伯尔博士讲到第二次世界大战的时候，屏幕上出现了一排排战斗机，散布在被炸毁的城市的残骸上。还有很多面孔混在一起——罗斯福、希特勒、斯大林。接着第二次世界大战随着投影仪的灯光而褪色。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The next time I entered the auditorium there were new faces on the screen and they were black. There hadn't been a black face on that screen -- at least none that I remembered -- since the lectures on slavery. I'd forgotten about them, these other Americans who were foreign to me. I had not tried to imagine the end of slavery: surely the call of justice had been heard by all, and the issue had been resolved.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="下一次我走进礼堂时，屏幕上出现了许多新面孔，他们都是黑人。自从那次关于奴隶制的讲座后，屏幕上就再没出现过黑人面孔——至少我不记得有过。我已经忘记了他们，这些美国人对我来说是外国人。我从没试着想象奴隶制的终结：毫无疑问，正义的呼声广为人知，这个问题已经得到解决。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This was my state of mind when Dr. Kimball began to lecture on something called the civil rights movement. A date appeared on the screen: 1963. I figured there'd been a mistake. I recalled that the Emancipation Proclamation had been issued in 1863. I couldn't account for that hundred years, so I assumed it was a typo. I copied the date into my notes with a question mark, but as more photographs flashed across the screen, it became clear which century the professor meant. The photos were black and white but their subjects were modern -- vibrant, well defined. They were not dry stills from another era; they captured movement. Marches. Police. Firefighters turning hoses on young men.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="金伯尔博士开始讲授民权运动时，我就是这样的心态。屏幕上出现了一个年份：一九六三。我想肯定是弄错了。我记得《奴隶解放宣言》[9]是一八六三年颁布的。我无法解释这一百年间发生了什么，所以我觉得那是一个输入错误。我把日期抄在笔记上，加了一个问号，但随着屏幕上闪现更多的照片，教授所指的是哪个世纪变得清晰起来。它们虽然是黑白照片，但主题是现代的——栩栩如生，意义明确。它们不是来自另一个时代干巴巴的静物照，它们捕捉到了运动的瞬间。游行。警察。消防队员将水管对准年轻人。【注：[9]时任美国总统林肯于1862年9月颁布《奴隶解放宣言》，规定从1863年1月1日起美国各州奴隶应被视为自由人。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The next name was Martin Luther King Jr. I had never seen his face before, or heard his name, and it was several minutes before I understood that Dr. Kimball didn't mean Martin Luther, who I had heard of. It took several more minutes for me to connect the name with the image on the screen -- of a dark-skinned man standing in front of a white marble temple and surrounded by a vast crowd. I had only just understood who he was and why he was speaking when I was told he had been murdered. I was still ignorant enough to be surprised.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="下一个名字是马丁·路德·金。我以前从未见过他的脸，也从未听过他的名字，过了几分钟我才明白金伯尔博士说的并不是我听说过的马丁·路德。我花了几分钟才将名字和屏幕上的图像联系起来——一名皮肤黝黑的男子站在一座白色大理石殿前，被一大群人簇拥着。我刚弄明白他是谁，刚了解到他为什么在那里发表演说，便被告知他被人谋杀了。我仍然那么无知，以至于为此震惊不已。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I don't know what Shawn saw on my face -- whether it was shock, anger or a vacant expression. Whatever it was, he was delighted by it. He'd found a vulnerability, a tender spot. It was too late to feign indifference.</div>

<div class="line_en">For the rest of the afternoon -- for the rest of the summer -- I was Nigger. I'd answered to it a thousand times before with indifference. If anything, I'd been amused and thought Shawn was clever. Now it made me want to gag him.

<div class="line_en">I did not think of my brother as that person; I doubt I will ever think of him that way. But something had shifted nonetheless. I had started on a path of awareness, had perceived something elemental about my brother, my father, myself. I had discerned the ways in which we had been sculpted by a tradition given to us by others, a tradition of which we were either willfully or accidentally ignorant. I had begun to understand that we had lent our voices to a discourse whose sole purpose was to dehumanize and brutalize others -- because nurturing that discourse was easier, because retaining power always feels like the way forward.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我觉得哥哥不是那种人；我想我永远都不会那样看待他。但无论如何，有些事情还是发生了变化。我开始了一段觉醒之路，对哥哥，对父亲，以及对我自己有了一些基本的认识。我已觉察出我们是如何被别人给予我们的传统所塑造，而这个传统我们有意或无意地忽视了。我开始明白，我们为一种话语发声，这种话语的唯一目的是丧失人性和残酷地对待他人——因为培养这种话语更容易，因为保有权力总是让人感觉在前进。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I couldn't articulate how the name made me feel. Shawn had meant it to humiliate me, to lock me in time, into an old idea of myself. But far from fixing me in place, that word transported me. Every time he said it --"Hey Nigger, raise the boom" or "Fetch me a level, Nigger"-- I returned to the university, to that auditorium, where I had watched human history unfold and wondered at my place in it. The stories of Emmett Till, Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King were called to my mind every time Shawn shouted, "Nigger, move to the next row." I saw their faces superimposed on every purlin Shawn welded into place that summer, so that by the end of it, I had finally begun to grasp something that should have been immediately apparent: that someone had opposed the great march toward equality; someone had been the person from whom freedom had to be wrested.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我说不清这个称呼给我什么感受。肖恩这样做是想羞辱我，把我锁在过去，困在过去的自我中。但这个词并未让我就范，反而将我送往别外。每次他说“嘿，黑鬼，开起吊杆”，或是“给我拿个水平仪，黑鬼”，我就仿佛回到了大学，回到了那间礼堂——我窥见人类的历史并思索我在其中的位置的地方。每次肖恩大喊“黑鬼，挪到下一排去”，我就想起罗莎·帕克斯、艾米特·提尔和马丁·路德·金的事迹。那个夏天，我看到他们的脸浮现在每一根肖恩焊接的檩条上，于是最后，我终于明白过来一个本来显而易见的事实：有的人反对平等的大潮；有的人必须从某些人那里夺取自由。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I could not have articulated this, not as I sweated through those searing afternoons in the forklift. I did not have the language I have now. But I understood this one fact: that a thousand times I had been called Nigger, and laughed, and now I could not laugh. The word and the way Shawn said it hadn't changed; only my ears were different. They no longer heard the jingle of a joke in it. What they heard was a signal, a call through time, which was answered with a mounting conviction: that never again would I allow myself to be made a foot soldier in a conflict I did not understand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在那些在叉车里度过的汗流浃背的炎热的下午，我无法清楚地表述出这些。那时的我还未掌握现在的语言。但我明白了一个事实：我曾一千次被叫黑鬼，以前我笑过，现在我笑不出来了。这个词没有变，肖恩说出它的方式也没有变，只是我的耳朵变了。它们听到的不再是其中的玩笑。它们听见的是一个信号，一种穿越时间的召唤，得到的回应是一种越来越坚定的信念：我再也不允许自己在一场我并不理解的冲突中首当其冲。">查看中文翻译</div>
