<div class="line_en">But Hester Prynne, with a mind of native courage and activity, and for so long a period not merely estranged, but outlawed, from society, had habituated herself to such latitude of speculation as was altogether foreign to the clergyman. She had wandered, without rule or guidance, in a moral wilderness; as vast, as intricate and shadowy, as the untamed forest, amid the gloom of which they were now holding a colloquy that was to decide their fate. Her intellect and heart had their home, as it were, in desert places, where she roamed as freely as the wild Indian in his woods. For years past she had looked from this estranged point of view at human institutions, and whatever priests or legislators had established; criticising all with hardly more reverence than the Indian would feel for the clerical band, the judicial robe, the pillory, the gallows, the fireside, or the church. The tendency of her fate and fortunes had been to set her free. The scarlet letter was her passport into regions where other women dared not tread. Shame, Despair, Solitude! These had been her teachers -- stern and wild ones -- and they had made her strong, but taught her much amiss.</div>

<div class="line_en">The minister, on the other hand, had never gone through an experience calculated to lead him beyond the scope of generally received laws; although, in a single instance, he had so fearfully transgressed one of the most sacred of them. But this had been a sin of passion, not of principle, nor even purpose. Since that wretched epoch, he had watched, with morbid zeal and minuteness, not his acts -- for those it was easy to arrange -- but each breath of emotion, and his every thought. At the head of the social system, as the clergyman of that day stood, he was only the more trammelled by its regulations, its principles, and even its prejudices. As a priest, the framework of his order inevitably hemmed him in. As a man who had once sinned, but who kept his conscience all alive and painfully sensitive by the fretting of an unhealed wound, he might have been supposed safer within the line of virtue than if he had never sinned at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而在牧师那一方面，却从来没有过一种经历会引导他跨越雷池一步；虽说只有一例，他曾经那么可怕地冒犯了其中最为神圣的戒条。但那只是情感冲动造成的罪过，并非原则上的对抗，甚至不是故意而为。从那倒霉的时日起，他一直以病态的热情，小心翼翼地监视着自己的，不是他的行为——因为这很容易调整——，而是他的每一丝情绪和每一个念头。当年，牧师们是身居社会首位的，因此他只能更受戒律、原则甚至偏见的束缚。身为牧师，他的等级观必然也会限制他。作为一个一度犯罪、但又因未愈的伤口的不断刺激而良心未泯并备受折磨的人，他或许会认为比起他从未有过罪孽反倒在道德上更加保险。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The decision once made, a glow of strange enjoyment threw its flickering brightness over the trouble of his breast. It was the exhilarating effect -- upon a prisoner just escaped from the dungeon of his own heart -- of breathing the wild, free atmosphere of an unredeemed, unchristianised, lawless region. His spirit rose, as it were, with a bound, and attained a nearer prospect of the sky, than throughout all the misery which had kept him grovelling on the earth. Of a deeply religious temperament, there was inevitably a tinge of the devotional in his mind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这决定一旦做出之后，一般欣喜异常的色彩便将其跳动的光辉投射到他胸中的烦恼之上。这种振奋人心的决定对于一个刚刚逃脱自己心灵禁锢的囚犯来说，有如踏上一片未受基督教化的、尚无法律管理的荒土，让他呼吸到那旷野的自由空气。他的精神就此一下升腾起来，比起被悲惨心境压得匍匐在地时，更近地看到了天空的景色。他是一个深具宗教气质的人，因此他的情绪上便必然会染上虔敬的色调。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"If, in all these past seven years," thought he, "I could recall one instant of peace or hope, I would yet endure, for the sake of that earnest of Heaven's mercy. But now -- since I am irrevocably doomed-wherefore should I not snatch the solace allowed to the condemned culprit before his execution? Or, if this be the path to a better life, as Hester would persuade me, I surely give up no fairer prospect by pursuing it! Neither can I any longer live without her companionship; so powerful is she to sustain -- so tender to soothe! O Thou to whom I dare not lift mine eyes, wilt Thou yet pardon me!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“在这过去的七个年头中，”他想着，“如果我还能回忆起有过瞬间的宁静或希望，我也会看在上天的仁慈的诚意上忍受下去的。可是如今，我既已命中注定无法挽回，又何必不去捕捉已经定罪的犯人临刑前所能得到的那点慰藉呢？或者说，象海丝特规劝我的那样，如果这是一条通往美好生活的途径，我踏上它肯定不是舍弃什么光明的前程！何况，没有她的陪伴，我再也活不下去了；她对我的支撑是那样有力，她对我的抚慰是那么温柔！啊，我不敢抬眼仰望的天神啊，你还肯再饶恕我吧！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So speaking, she undid the clasp that fastened the scarlet letter, and, taking it from her bosom, threw it to a distance among the withered leaves. The mystic token alighted on the hither verge of the stream. With a hand's breadth farther flight it would have fallen into the water, and have given the little brook another woe to carry onward, besides the unintelligible tale which it still kept murmuring about. But there lay the embroidered letter, glittering like a lost jewel, which some ill-fated wanderer might pick up, and thenceforth be haunted by strange phantoms of guilt, sinkings of the heart, and unaccountable misfortune.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她一边这样说着，一边解开别着红字的胸针，从胸前取下红字，远远地抛到枯叶之中。那神秘的标志落在离小溪不远的地方。只消再飞这几指宽的距离，红字就会落进水里，那样的话，小溪除去连续不断地喃喃诉说着的莫测的故事之外，又要载着另一段哀怨流淌了。但那个刺绣的红字落在岸边，象一颗遗失的珠宝似的闪闪发光，某个倒霉的流浪者可能会把它拣起来，从此便会被神秘的罪恶幽灵、沉沦的心灵和难言的不幸所萦绕了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Do I feel joy again?" cried he, wondering at himself. "Methought the germ of it was dead in me! O Hester, thou art my better angel! I seem to have flung myself -- sick, sin-stained, and sorrow-blackened-down upon these forest-leaves, and to have risen up all made anew, and with new powers to glorify Him that hath been merciful! This is already the better life! Why did we not find it sooner?"</div>

<div class="line_en">The stigma gone, Hester heaved a long, deep sigh, in which the burden of shame and anguish departed from her spirit. Oh, exquisite relief! She had not known the weight, until she felt the freedom! By another impulse, she took off the formal cap that confined her hair; and down it fell upon her shoulders, dark and rich, with at once a shadow and a light in its abundance, and imparting the charm of softness to her features. There played around her mouth, and beamed out of her eyes, a radiant and tender smile, that seemed gushing from the very heart of womanhood. A crimson flush was glowing on her cheek, that had been long so pale. Her sex, her youth, and the whole richness of the beauty, came back from what men call the irrevocable past, and clustered themselves, with her maiden hope, and a happiness before unknown, within the magic circle of this hour. And, as if the gloom of the earth and sky had been but the effluence of these two mortal hearts, it vanished with their sorrow. All at once, as with a sudden smile of heaven, forth burst the sunshine, pouring a very flood into the obscure forest, gladdening each green leaf, transmuting the yellow fallen ones to gold, and gleaming adown the grey trunks of the solemn trees. The objects that had made a shadow hitherto, embodied the brightness now. The course of the little brook might be traced by its merry gleam afar into the wood's heart of mystery, which had become a mystery of joy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="海丝特除掉那耻辱的标志之后，深深长叹一声，她的精神就此解脱了耻辱和苦闷的重荷，轻松得简直飘然欲仙了！她如今感到了自由，才明白那重荷的份量！随着另一次冲动，她摘下了那顶束发的正正经经的帽子；满头乌黑浓密的秀发立刻飘洒在肩头，厚实之中显出光影婆婆，为她的容貌乎添了柔和之美。她的嘴角和眼波中散发出温柔的嫣然笑意，似是涌自她女性的心头。长期以来十分苍白的面颊也泛起红潮。她的女性，她的青春，和她各方面的美，都从所谓的无可挽回的过去中恢复了，伴随而来的是她少女时期的希望和一种前所不知的幸福，都在此时此刻的魔圈中荟萃一堂。而且，那种天昏地暗似乎是这两个人心中流泄出来的，此时也随着他们忧伤的消逝而消散了。突然之间，天空似乎一下子绽出微笑，立时阳光四射，将灿烂的光芒洒向膝腕的树林，使每一片绿叶都兴高采烈，把所有枯黄的落时染成金黄，连肃穆的树木的灰色树干也闪出亮光。原先造成阴影的东西，如今也成了发光体。小溪的河道也愉快地粼粼闪光，溯源而上可以直抵树林的那神秘心脏。此时也已成为一种欢乐的神秘。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Such was the sympathy of Nature -- that wild, heathen Nature of the forest, never subjugated by human law, nor illumined by higher truth -- with the bliss of these two spirits! Love, whether newly born, or aroused from a death-like slumber, must always create a sunshine, filling the heart so full of radiance, that it overflows upon the outward world. Had the forest still kept its gloom, it would have been bright in Hester's eyes, and bright in Arthur Dimmesdale's!</div>

The ray quivered to and fro, making her figure dim or distinct -- now like a real child, now like a child's spirit -- as the splendour went and came again. She heard her mother's voice, and approached slowly through the forest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="海丝特莞尔一笑，又叫了一声珠儿，这时可以看见她了，就在一段距离之外，正如牧师所说，她站在透过树弯照到她身上的一道阳光之中，象是个被了一层灿烂衣装的幻影。那阳光来回抖动，使得她的身影忽明忽暗——一会儿象是个活生生的孩子，一会儿又象是孩子的精灵——随着阳光去面复返。她听到了她母亲的呼唤，慢慢穿过树林走了过来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And she was gentler here than in the grassy-margined streets of the settlement, or in her mother's cottage. The flowers appeared to know it; and one and another whispered as she passed, "Adorn thyself with me, thou beautiful child, adorn thyself with me!" -- and, to please them, Pearl gathered the violets, and anemones, and columbines, and some twigs of the freshest green, which the old trees held down before her eyes. With these she decorated her hair, and her young waist, and became a nymph-child, or an infant dryad, or whatever else was in closest sympathy with the antique wood. In such guise had Pearl adorned herself, when she heard her mother's voice, and came slowly back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而她在这林中，也要比在居民区两边铺了草的街道上，或是她母亲的茅屋中，显得温和些。花朵象是明白这一点；在她经过时，就会有那么一两朵悄声低语：“用我来打扮打扮你自己吧，你这漂亮的孩子，用我来打扮打扮你自己吧！”——而为了让它们高兴，珠儿也就摘了几朵紫罗兰、银莲花和耧斗菜，以及一些从老树上垂到她眼前的翠绿的嫩枝。她用这些花枝编成花环，戴往头发上，缠在腰肢间，于是便成了一个小仙子，或是林中小仙女，或是同古老的树林最为亲密无间的什么精灵。珠儿把自己这样打扮好了，便听到她母亲的呼唤，慢慢地往回走去。">查看中文翻译</div>
