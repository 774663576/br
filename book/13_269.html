<div class="line_en">Sam put his ragged orc-cloak under his master's head, and covered them both with the grey robe of Lórien; and as he did so his thoughts went out to that fair land, and to the Elves, and he hoped that the cloth woven by their hands might have some virtue to keep them hidden beyond all hope in this wilderness of fear. He heard the scuffling and cries die down as the troops passed on through the Isenmouthe. It seemed that in the confusion and the mingling of many companies of various kinds they had not been missed, not yet at any rate.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sam took a sip of water, but pressed Frodo to drink, and when his master had recovered a little he gave him a whole wafer of their precious waybread and made him eat it. Then, too worn out even to feel much fear, they stretched themselves out. They slept a little in uneasy fits; for their sweat grew chill on them, and the hard stones bit them, and they shivered. Out of the north from the Black Gate through Cirith Gorgor there flowed whispering along the ground a thin cold air.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆啜饮了一口水，让佛罗多喝了一大口，当主人稍稍恢复了一点体力之后，他把一整片宝贵的干粮都逼主人吃下去。然后，疲倦的两人甚至没有多余的力气感到恐惧，于是就这么大剌剌地躺在地上睡觉。他们睡得并不安稳，之前滚烫的汗水变得冰冷，锐利的石头让他们全身疼痛，两人还止不住打着哆嗦。一阵阵的冷风从黑门吹往西力斯葛哥，不断把两人身上的体温夺走。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the morning a grey light came again, for in the high regions the West Wind still blew, but down on the stones behind the fences of the Black Land the air seemed almost dead, chill and yet stifling. Sam looked up out of the hollow. The land all about was dreary, flat and drab-hued. On the roads nearby nothing was moving now; but Sam feared the watchful eyes on the wall of the Isenmouthe, no more than a furlong away northward. South-eastward, far off like a dark standing shadow, loomed the Mountain. Smokes were pouring from it, and while those that rose into the upper air trailed away eastward, great rolling clouds floated down its sides and spread over the land. A few miles to the north-east the foothills of the Ashen Mountains stood like sombre grey ghosts, behind which the misty northern heights rose like a line of distant cloud hardly darker than the lowering sky.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到了早晨，天色再度泛白，在高处依旧吹着西风，但在这暗黑大地的围栏之内，空气几乎是完全停滞的，四周一片冰冷，却又让人喘不过气来。山姆往凹坑外面打量，四周的所有地形全都是千篇一律的单调、死气沉沉，附近的道路上空无一人，但山姆担心不远处的艾辛口，依旧有人监视着此地。阴沉的火山则是带着让人不寒而栗的气势矗立在东南方，山头冒出大量的浓烟，在强风的吹送下它飘往东方的高空，从它的山侧冒出浓密的黑云，掩盖了整块大地；东北方几哩处则是灰烬山脉，看起来像是阴郁的灰色鬼魂一样毫无生气；北方的地平线上挂着低垂的乌云，和地面的苍凉比起来并不逊色。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"So that was the job I felt I had to do when I started," thought Sam: "to help Mr. Frodo to the last step and then die with him? Well, if that is the job then I must do it. But I would dearly like to see Bywater again, and Rosie Cotton and her brothers, and the Gaffer and Marigold and all. I can't think somehow that Gandalf would have sent Mr. Frodo on this errand, if there hadn't a' been any hope of his ever coming back at all. Things all went wrong when he went down in Moria. I wish he hadn't. He would have done something."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“原来这就是我出发时，觉得自己该做的工作，”山姆想：“协助佛罗多先生走出最后几步，和他死在一起。好吧，如果这真的是我的使命，我必须完成它。可是，我真的好想再看见临水路，还有小玫—卡顿和她的兄弟们，以及我们家老爹和马利葛。如果佛罗多先生根本回不来，我实在不能想像甘道夫为什么要派他来？当他死在摩瑞亚的时候，一切都不对劲了。我真希望他还活着，这样他至少可以做些什么。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sam tried to guess the distances and to decide what way they ought to take. "It looks every step of fifty miles," he muttered gloomily, staring at the threatening mountain, "and that'll take a week, if it takes a day, with Mr. Frodo as he is." He shook his head, and as he worked things out, slowly a new dark thought grew in his mind. Never for long had hope died in his staunch heart, and always until now he had taken some thought for their return. But the bitter truth came home to him at last: at best their provision would take them to their goal; and when the task was done, there they would come to an end, alone, houseless, foodless in the midst of a terrible desert. There could be no return.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆试着猜测确实的距离以及应该走的道路。“看起来至少有五十哩，”他瞪着那丑恶的火山，嘴里嘀咕着：“如果本来要花一天，但以佛罗多先生现在的状况，可能得拖上一整个星期。”他摇摇头，仔细的思索着，但一种丧气的想法却逐渐在他心中累积。在他坚强的内心中，希望从来没有真正消失过，在这之前，他总是乐观的认为大伙都还有回家的机会；不过，现在，他终于认清了这苦涩的事实：即使在最乐观的状态下，他们的补给品也仅足以让他们抵达目标；等到任务完成之后，他们会孤单地置身在一块死寂、没有食物、没有饮水的沙漠正中央。他们不可能回去了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">With a new sense of responsibility he brought his eyes back to the ground near at hand, studying the next move. As the light grew a little he saw to his surprise that what from a distance had seemed wide and featureless flats were in fact all broken and tumbled. Indeed the whole surface of the plains of Gorgoroth was pocked with great holes, as if, while it was still a waste of soft mud, it had been smitten with a shower of bolts and huge slingstones. The largest of these holes were rimmed with ridges of broken rock, and broad fissures ran out from them in all directions. It was a land in which it would be possible to creep from hiding to hiding, unseen by all but the most watchful eyes: possible at least for one who was strong and had no need for speed. For the hungry and worn, who had far to go before life failed, it had an evil look.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他怀着更强的责任感把目光重新专注回眼前，研究着下一步该怎么做。随着光线渐渐增强，他惊讶地看见原先宽广的平原上竟布满了碎石；事实上，整个葛哥洛斯平原都满是大大小小的坑洞，彷佛当此地还是软泥浆的时候，有无数的碎石落得满地都是，打得到处都凹凸不平。最大的坑洞旁边都有一圈的岩石包围，还有许多裂隙从中间往外延伸。这块土地的确可以让人从一个掩蔽处无声无息地来到下一个掩蔽，连最尽责的哨兵都很难发现这里有任何人入侵。至少，如果这个潜入者十分强壮，不需要担心饮食的问题，这里对他来说就不会是太大的挑战。因为，在两人抵达终点之前，他们所必须面对的疲倦和饥饿，将会对他们的精神和意志构成最大的考验。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But even as hope died in Sam, or seemed to die, it was turned to a new strength. Sam's plain hobbit-face grew stern, almost grim, as the will hardened in him, and he felt through all his limbs a thrill, as if he was turning into some creature of stone and steel that neither despair nor weariness nor endless barren miles could subdue.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，当山姆的希望之火熄灭的同时，它也转化成了一股新的力量。山姆平凡的小脸变得十分严肃，坚定的决心在背后支持着他，让他全身觉得一阵战栗。他似乎化成了某种不会失望、疲倦的钢铁怪物，连眼前这一望无际的荒原也无法让他退缩。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Once more they started, crawling from hollow to hollow, flitting behind such cover as they could find, but moving always in a slant towards the foothills of the northern range. But as they went the most easterly of the roads followed them, until it ran off, hugging the skirts of the mountains, away into a wall of black shadow far ahead. Neither man nor orc now moved along its flat grey stretches; for the Dark Lord had almost completed the movement of his forces, and even in the fastness of his own realm he sought the secrecy of night, fearing the winds of the world that had turned against him, tearing aside his veils, and troubled with tidings of bold spies that had passed through his fences.</div>

<div class="line_en">The hobbits had gone a few weary miles when they halted. Frodo seemed nearly spent. Sam saw that he could not go much further in this fashion, crawling, stooping, now picking a doubtful way very slowly, now hurrying at a stumbling run.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈比人走了好几哩，最后才疲倦地停下来，佛罗多几乎已经快累倒了，山姆看得出来，他没办法继续这样再走多远了。在此之前，他们必须弯腰前进、躲躲藏藏，有时刻意迂回，有时又必须加快脚步。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He was taking a far greater risk than he knew; but Frodo was too much occupied with his burden and with the struggle in his mind to debate, and almost too hopeless to care. They climbed on to the causeway and trudged along, down the hard cruel road that led to the Dark Tower itself. But their luck held, and for the rest of that day they met no living or moving thing; and when night fell they vanished into the darkness of Mordor. All the land now brooded as at the coming of a great storm: for the Captains of the West had passed the Cross-roads and set flames in the deadly fields of Imlad Morgul.</div>

<div class="line_en">So the desperate journey went on, as the Ring went south and the banners of the kings rode north. For the hobbits each day, each mile, was more bitter than the one before, as their strength lessened and the land became more evil. They met no enemies by day. At times by night, as they cowered or drowsed uneasily in some hiding beside the road, they heard cries and the noise of many feet or the swift passing of some cruelly ridden steed. But far worse than all such perils was the ever-approaching threat that beat upon them as they went: the dreadful menace of the Power that waited, brooding in deep thought and sleepless malice behind the dark veil about its Throne. Nearer and nearer it drew, looming blacker, like the oncoming of a wall of night at the last end of the world.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就这样，他们绝望的旅程继续下去，魔戒持续往南，而人皇的旗帜则是不停往北。对于哈比人来说，每一天、每一哩都比之前更煎熬，他们的力量不停流失，脚下的土地也变得越来越邪恶。白天他们不会遇见任何的敌人，到了晚上，当他们不安地打盹时，偶尔会听见旁边的道路传来脚步声或是饱受鞭打的马匹喘气声。不过，比这些都还要让人害怕的是那一直不断接近，像是一波波浪潮般打在他们身上的威胁感：那是坐在黑暗王座上，沉思着、考虑着应该如何征服世界的邪恶力量。它越来越近，剥夺人们的希望，如同世界末日般毫不留情地迫近。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There came at last a dreadful nightfall; and even as the Captains of the West drew near to the end of the living lands, the two wanderers came to an hour of blank despair. Four days had passed since they had escaped from the orcs, but the time lay behind them like an ever-darkening dream. All this last day Frodo had not spoken, but had walked half-bowed, often stumbling, as if his eyes no longer saw the way before his feet. Sam guessed that among all their pains he bore the worst, the growing weight of the Ring, a burden on the body and a torment to his mind. Anxiously Sam had noted how his master's left hand would often be raised as if to ward off a blow, or to screen his shrinking eyes from a dreadful Eye that sought to look in them. And sometimes his right hand would creep to his breast, clutching, and then slowly, as the will recovered mastery, it would be withdrawn.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，最恐怖的一夜降临了。西方的将领们已经快要进入魔多那死气沉沉的疆域，这两名旅人则是陷入了彻底绝望的处境中。他们从半兽人的部队中脱逃已经四天了，但每一天过的都像是一场越来越黑暗的噩梦一样。在这最后一天，佛罗多沉默不语，只是弯腰驼背地走着，脚步非常不稳，彷佛他的眼睛已经无法看见脚下的土地。山姆猜得出来，除了两人都必须忍耐的无比疲倦之外，他还必须承受魔戒对于身体和心灵的折磨。山姆注意到主人的左手，经常会无意识地举起来，彷佛是为了遮挡攻击或是躲避想要搜寻他们的邪眼；有时，他的右手会捧着胸口，慢慢的，随着他恢复自制力之后，那手才会拿开。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Now as the blackness of night returned Frodo sat, his head between his knees, his arms hanging wearily to the ground where his hands lay feebly twitching. Sam watched him, till night covered them both and hid them from one another. He could no longer find any words to say; and he turned to his own dark thoughts. As for himself, though weary and under a shadow of fear, he still had some strength left. The lembas had a virtue without which they would long ago have lain down to die. It did not satisfy desire, and at times Sam's mind was filled with the memories of food, and the longing for simple bread and meats. And yet this waybread of the Elves had a potency that increased as travellers relied on it alone and did not mingle it with other foods. It fed the will, and it gave strength to endure, and to master sinew and limb beyond the measure of mortal kind. But now a new decision must be made. They could not follow this road any longer; for it went on eastward into the great Shadow, but the Mountain now loomed upon their right, almost due south, and they must turn towards it. Yet still before it there stretched a wide region of fuming, barren, ash-ridden land.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在夜色再度落下之后，佛罗多抱着头坐在地上，手臂疲倦地垂向地面，手指则会无意识地抽搐着。山姆看着他，直到夜色将两人的身影完全掩盖为止，他再也不知道该说些什么，只能默默的沉思着。虽然他非常疲倦、满心恐惧，但他的力量并没有完全被消磨掉。精灵的干粮有种特别的力量，否则他们早就自怨自艾地躺下来等死，不过，它却无法完全满足食欲，山姆有时脑海中挤满了对食物的回忆，他只想要能够拿着普通的面包和肉，咬上几口。虽然这精灵口粮并非完美，但只要旅行者完全不吃别的东西，只靠它来填饱肚子，它的效果就会更为增加。它可以加强意志力，让人拥有更强的耐力，并且驱使肌肉和骨骼承受远远超越一般人极限的考验。不过，此时他们必须要作出决定了！他们已经不能继续走这条路了，因为它只会通往魔影的大本营；但火山却在他们的右方，也就是正南方的方向，他们必须要转头了。不过，在火山和他们之间，依旧是一块荒凉、冒着毒烟，遍地灰烬的残破大地。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Water, water!" muttered Sam. He had stinted himself, and in his parched mouth his tongue seemed thick and swollen; but for all his care they now had very little left, perhaps half his bottle, and maybe there were still days to go. All would long ago have been spent, if they had not dared to follow the orc-road. For at long intervals on that highway cisterns had been built for the use of troops sent in haste through the waterless regions. In one Sam had found some water left, stale, muddied by the orcs, but still sufficient for their desperate case. Yet that was now a day ago. There was no hope of any more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“水，水怎么办！”山姆嘀咕着。他已经把自己的配额减到不能再少，他觉得自己的舌头似乎都已经肿了起来。但即使他这么精打细算、极力强忍，手上的食物和饮水还是剩下不多。他大概只剩半壶水，眼前却还有好几天要走，如果他们不是冒险走上这条路，可能好几天前水就喝光了。这条道路的路边兴建有一些临时储水槽，主要是提供给仓皇赶路的部队，在这缺水的地区使用的。山姆在其中一个里找到一些酸臭、被半兽人弄得都是泥巴的水。不过，以他们目前的状况来说，这水已经不算太坏了。糟糕的是，眼前恐怕还要走上好几天，他们不可能再找到任何水了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At last wearied with his cares Sam drowsed, leaving the morrow till it came; he could do no more. Dream and waking mingled uneasily. He saw lights like gloating eyes, and dark creeping shapes, and he heard noises as of wild beasts or the dreadful cries of tortured things; and he would start up to find the world all dark and only empty blackness all about him. Once only, as he stood and stared wildly round, did it seem that, though now awake, he could still see pale lights like eyes; but soon they flickered and vanished.</div>

Such daylight as followed was dim; for here as the Mountain drew near the air was ever mirky, while out from the Dark Tower there crept the veils of Shadow that Sauron wove about himself. Frodo was lying on his back not moving. Sam stood beside him, reluctant to speak, and yet knowing that the word now lay with him: he must set his master's will to work for another effort.

<div class="line_en">Frodo looked again towards the Mountain. "No," he said, "we shan't need much on that road. And at its end nothing."

In the dimness of its dreary day few things even in that land of vigilance could have espied them, save from close at hand. Of all the slaves of the Dark Lord, only the Nazgûl could have warned him of the peril that crept, small but indomitable, into the very heart of his guarded realm.

He went without himself; and now as once more the night of Mordor closed over them, through all his thoughts there came the memory of water; and every brook or stream or fount that he had ever seen, under green willow-shades or twinkling in the sun, danced and rippled for his torment behind the blindness of his eyes. He felt the cool mud about his toes as he paddled in the Pool at Bywater with Jolly Cotton and Tom and Nibs, and their sister Rosie. "But that was years ago," he sighed, "and far away.

<div class="line_en">He looked back, and then he looked up; and he was amazed to see how far his last effort had brought him. The Mountain standing ominous and alone had looked taller than it was. Sam saw now that it was less lofty than the high passes of the Ephel Dúath which he and Frodo had scaled. The confused and tumbled shoulders of its great base rose for maybe three thousand feet above the plain, and above them was reared half as high again its tall central cone, like a vast oast or chimney capped with a jagged crater. But already Sam was more than half way up the base, and the plain of Gorgoroth was dim below him, wrapped in fume and shadow. As he looked up he would have given a shout, if his parched throat had allowed him; for amid the rugged humps and shoulders above him he saw plainly a path or road. It climbed like a rising girdle from the west and wound snakelike about the Mountain, until before it went round out of view it reached the foot of the cone upon its eastern side.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sam could not see the course immediately above him, where it was lowest, for a steep slope went up from where he stood; but he guessed that if he could only struggle on just a little way further up, they would strike this path. A gleam of hope returned to him. They might conquer the Mountain yet. "Why, it might have been put there a-purpose!" he said to himself. "If it wasn't there, I'd have to say I was beaten in the end."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆没办法看清这路确实的位置，因为它正处在最低的地方，被他眼前陡峭的斜坡给遮挡住了。不过，根据他的猜测，只要他再往上一小段路，他就可以踏上这条路。他又重新燃起了希望，或许他们真的可以爬上火山顶。“哈，路在那边就是有道理的！”他自言自语道：“如果不是这样，我恐怕就真的被打败了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The path was not put there for the purposes of Sam. He did not know it, but he was looking at Sauron's Road from Barad-dûr to the Sammath Naur, the Chambers of Fire. Out from the Dark Tower's huge western gate it came over a deep abyss by a vast bridge of iron, and then passing into the plain it ran for a league between two smoking chasms, and so reached a long sloping causeway that led up on to the Mountain's eastern side. Thence, turning and encircling all its wide girth from south to north, it climbed at last, high in the upper cone, but still far from the reeking summit, to a dark entrance that gazed back east straight to the Window of the Eye in Sauron's shadow-mantled fortress. Often blocked or destroyed by the tumults of the Mountain's furnaces, always that road was repaired and cleared again by the labours of countless orcs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这条路并不是为了山姆而建，他并不知道他眼前的是从巴拉多通往萨马斯瑙尔，火焰之厅的索伦之路。这条路从邪黑塔巨大的西门出发，藉着一座巨大的铁桥越过深渊，然后通过两个冒烟的深坑，沿着斜坡通往火山的东边。从那边开始，这条路由南向北环绕整座火山，来到火山锥上部的一个黑暗入口。这里距离火山口还很远，但却可以直视索伦要塞中最重要的魔眼之窗。这条路经常由于火山的爆发而受到破坏或阻挡，不过，数量庞大的半兽人会快速地修好这条路。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So foot by foot, like small grey insects, they crept up the slope. They came to the path and found that it was broad, paved with broken rubble and beaten ash. Frodo clambered on to it, and then moved as if by some compulsion he turned slowly to face the East. Far off the shadows of Sauron hung; but torn by some gust of wind out of the world, or else moved by some great disquiet within, the mantling clouds swirled, and for a moment drew aside; and then he saw, rising black, blacker and darker than the vast shades amid which it stood, the cruel pinnacles and iron crown of the topmost tower of Barad-dûr. One moment only it stared out, but as from some great window immeasurably high there stabbed northward a flame of red, the flicker of a piercing Eye; and then the shadows were furled again and the terrible vision was removed. The Eye was not turned to them: it was gazing north to where the Captains of the West stood at bay, and thither all its malice was now bent, as the Power moved to strike its deadly blow; but Frodo at that dreadful glimpse fell as one stricken mortally. His hand sought the chain about his neck.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因此，他们两个人就一步一步，像是小虫子一样艰辛地往上爬。他们好不容易才来到那条路上，庆幸地发现这路是用碎石和灰烬所铺成，十分平坦、相当宽阔好走。佛罗多辛苦的站起来，却似乎受到某种力量的引诱，缓缓地转过头去看着西方。索伦的阴影高挂在天空，但却似乎受到外界吹来的风打搅，或是由于自己内部的混乱──总之眼前的云朵开始翻滚，一瞬间露出了无比黝黑，高耸，巴拉多要塞的钢铁尖塔。尖塔只出现了一刹那，但彷佛有道暗红的火焰从极高的地方劲射而出，那是一只血红邪眼的目光。邪眼看的并不是他们，它的目标在北方，在那些胆敢以小搏大的西方将领身上。它所有的邪恶意志全都集中在该处，准备施以最后、最致命的一击！但是，佛罗多一看到那景象，立刻彷佛挨了致命一击般的倒了下来，他的手不由自主地伸向胸前的项练。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sam drew a deep breath. There was a path, but how he was to get up the slope to it he did not know. First he must ease his aching back. He lay flat beside Frodo for a while. Neither spoke. Slowly the light grew. Suddenly a sense of urgency which he did not understand came to Sam. It was almost as if he had been called: "Now, now, or it will be too late!" He braced himself and got up. Frodo also seemed to have felt the call. He struggled to his knees.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆深吸一口气，眼前的确有条路，但他不知道自己要怎么样越过斜坡，首先他必须让自己酸痛的背部好好休息一下。他躺在佛罗多身边，两人都沉默不语。慢慢的，天光越来越明亮，山姆却突然间感到一股莫名的急迫感，他似乎听到有人对他大喊：“快点，快点！不然就来不及了！”他逼着自己站起来，佛罗多似乎也感应到了这召唤，挣扎着跟着跪起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Again he lifted Frodo and drew his hands down to his own breast, letting his master's legs dangle. Then he bowed his head and struggled off along the climbing road. It was not as easy a way to take as it had looked at first. By fortune the fires that had poured forth in the great turmoils when Sam stood upon Cirith Ungol had flowed down mainly on the southern and western slopes, and the road on this side was not blocked. Yet in many places it had crumbled away or was crossed by gaping rents. After climbing eastward for some time it bent back upon itself at a sharp angle and went westward for a space. There at the bend it was cut deep through a crag of old weathered stone once long ago vomited from the Mountain's furnaces. Panting under his load Sam turned the bend; and even as he did so, out of the corner of his eye, he had a glimpse of something falling from the crag, like a small piece of black stone that had toppled off as he passed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆再一次的将佛罗多背起来，让他的手挂在自己的胸前，主人的脚则是无力的垂着。然后，山姆低下头，沿着斜坡奋力往上走。这并不像他之前以为的那么好走，幸好，当山姆和佛罗多还在西力斯昂哥时，爆发的岩浆多半都是往西边和南边的斜坡流，路的这边并没有被挡住。但是，道路上还是有许多落石，也有很多巨大的裂口，它在往东攀升了一段距离之后，转了个大弯，往西边继续前进。道路转弯的地方刚好切穿了一块饱经风霜的巨石，可能是在无数个纪元之前火山爆发的结果。背着千斤重担的山姆，气喘吁吁地绕过这个大弯，正当他这样做的时候，他从眼角似乎看见了有什么黑呼呼的东西从大石上落了下来，似乎是悬崖上掉落的石块。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sam knelt by him. Faint, almost inaudibly, he heard Frodo whispering: "Help me, Sam! Help me, Sam! Hold my hand! I can't stop it." Sam took his master's hands and laid them together, palm to palm, and kissed them; and then he held them gently between his own. The thought came suddenly to him: "He's spotted us! It's all up, or it soon will be. Now, Sam Gamgee, this is the end of ends."</div>

<div class="line_en">With a violent heave Sam rose up. At once he drew his sword; but he could do nothing. Gollum and Frodo were locked together. Gollum was tearing at his master, trying to get at the chain and the Ring. This was probably the only thing that could have roused the dying embers of Frodo's heart and will: an attack, an attempt to wrest his treasure from him by force. He fought back with a sudden fury that amazed Sam, and Gollum also. Even so things might have gone far otherwise, if Gollum himself had remained unchanged; but whatever dreadful paths, lonely and hungry and waterless, he had trodden, driven by a devouring desire and a terrible fear, they had left grievous marks on him. He was a lean, starved, haggard thing, all bones and tight-drawn sallow skin. A wild light flamed in his eyes, but his malice was no longer matched by his old griping strength. Frodo flung him off and rose up quivering.</div>

A crouching shape, scarcely more than the shadow of a living thing, a creature now wholly ruined and defeated, yet filled with a hideous lust and rage; and before it stood stern, untouchable now by pity, a figure robed in white, but at its breast it held a wheel of fire.

It would be just to slay this treacherous, murderous creature, just and many times deserved; and also it seemed the only safe thing to do.

He himself, though only for a little while, had borne the Ring, and now dimly he guessed the agony of Gollum's shrivelled mind and body, enslaved to that Ring, unable to find peace or relief ever in life again.

<div class="line_en">At first he could see nothing. In his great need he drew out once more the phial of Galadriel, but it was pale and cold in his trembling hand and threw no light into that stifling dark. He was come to the heart of the realm of Sauron and the forges of his ancient might, greatest in Middle-earth; all other powers were here subdued. Fearfully he took a few uncertain steps in the dark, and then all at once there came a flash of red that leaped upward, and smote the high black roof. Then Sam saw that he was in a long cave or tunnel that bored into the Mountain's smoking cone.

<div class="line_cn" title="底下的火焰愤怒地苏醒过来，红光照耀着整个洞穴，四周全都被染得一片血红、酷热难耐。山姆突然间看见咕鲁的手移近他的嘴巴，白森森的利齿一闪，迅即一咬──佛罗多惨叫一声，紧接着就现出身形，跪倒在深渊的边缘。咕鲁则像是疯了一般高举着魔戒，在深渊的边缘狂舞着，戒指中还连着一根血淋淋手指…魔戒发出刺眼的光芒，彷佛它是由纯粹的火焰所打造而成的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">From all his policies and webs of fear and treachery, from all his stratagems and wars his mind shook free; and throughout his realm a tremor ran, his slaves quailed, and his armies halted, and his captains suddenly steerless, bereft of will, wavered and despaired. For they were forgotten. The whole mind and purpose of the Power that wielded them was now bent with overwhelming force upon the Mountain. At his summons, wheeling with a rending cry, in a last desperate race there flew, faster than the winds, the Nazgûl, the Ring-wraiths, and with a storm of wings they hurtled southwards to Mount Doom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的意志从所有的计谋、一切的陷阱、四周的战场和将领的心中撤离了；整个国度都为此震撼不已，他的奴隶惊慌恐惧，部队停止前进，将领失去了鞭策、操弄他们的力量，只感到无比绝望，因为他们被遗忘了！魔王用来掌控、监视他们的全部力量，都转而投入末日火山中。在他的召唤下，戒灵们惨嚎一声，用比风还快的速度急速回防，绝望地想赶回这一切危机的根源。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Sam got up. He was dazed, and blood streaming from his head dripped in his eyes. He groped forward, and then he saw a strange and terrible thing. Gollum on the edge of the abyss was fighting like a mad thing with an unseen foe. To and fro he swayed, now so near the brink that almost he tumbled in, now dragging back, falling to the ground, rising, and falling again. And all the while he hissed but spoke no words.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="山姆站了起来，他觉得头晖目眩，伤口中的血液流进他眼中，他奋力往前一扑，却看见了一个奇怪而恐怖的景象──站在深渊边缘的咕鲁，正在和一个隐形的敌人搏斗；他不停地前后摇晃着，在这么靠近裂隙的地方，他有几次险些摔落火山中。他摔倒在地上，立刻爬起来，接着又摔倒；在这段过程中，他只是不停的发出嘶嘶声，一句话也不说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a roar and a great confusion of noise. Fires leaped up and licked the roof. The throbbing grew to a great tumult, and the Mountain shook. Sam ran to Frodo and picked him up and carried him out to the door. And there upon the dark threshold of the Sammath Naur, high above the plains of Mordor, such wonder and terror came on him that he stood still forgetting all else, and gazed as one turned to stone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一阵怒吼，和极为混乱的众多声响交杂在一起，火焰激射而出，舔食着洞顶；原先的波动成了惊人的巨震，整座火山不停地摇晃。山姆跑到佛罗多身边，扶着他奔出门外，就在那萨马斯瑙尔的门口，俯瞰着魔多平原的地方，他感到无比震撼与恐惧，呆立着望向远方──">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A brief vision he had of swirling cloud, and in the midst of it towers and battlements, tall as hills, founded upon a mighty mountain-throne above immeasurable pits; great courts and dungeons, eyeless prisons sheer as cliffs, and gaping gates of steel and adamant: and then all passed. Towers fell and mountains slid; walls crumbled and melted, crashing down; vast spires of smoke and spouting steams went billowing up, up, until they toppled like an overwhelming wave, and its wild crest curled and came foaming down upon the land. And then at last over the miles between there came a rumble, rising to a deafening crash and roar; the earth shook, the plain heaved and cracked, and Orodruin reeled. Fire belched from its riven summit. The skies burst into thunder seared with lightning. Down like lashing whips fell a torrent of black rain. And into the heart of the storm, with a cry that pierced all other sounds, tearing the clouds asunder, the Nazgûl came, shooting like flaming bolts, as caught in the fiery ruin of hill and sky they crackled, withered, and went out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的眼前掠过一道狂卷的乌云，在那之中是高塔和要塞，与山丘一样高，座落在一座陡峭的高山顶，俯瞰着许多的洞穴，有极大的广场和地牢，不见天日、犯人插翅难飞的监狱，钢铁和精金打造的大门…然后，一切都消逝了。高塔崩垮，高山落下，墙壁粉碎融化、跌落地面，浓密的烟尘和雾气冲天直上，直到顶端撞击到高空，又如同暴雨一般落洒回地面…最后，大地传来了闷响，渐渐转变成怒吼，地动山摇，平原炸开了多处裂口，欧洛都因喷发了！火焰从它的顶端直冲云霄，天空中雷鸣电闪，滂沱的黑雨如同洪水一般直灌而下…在这风暴的正中心，戒灵们像是利箭一般撕裂云层和浓烟，却如同大地一般剥落、熔融，消失在空气中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Precious, precious, precious!" Gollum cried. "My Precious! O my Precious!" And with that, even as his eyes were lifted up to gloat on his prize, he stepped too far, toppled, wavered for a moment on the brink, and then with a shriek he fell. Out of the depths came his last wail Precious, and he was gone.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Master!" cried Sam, and fell upon his knees. In all that ruin of the world for the moment he felt only joy, great joy. The burden was gone. His master had been saved; he was himself again, he was free. And then Sam caught sight of the maimed and bleeding hand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“主人！”山姆大喊着跪了下来。在这天崩地裂的关头，他只觉得兴奋、无比的愉悦。重担毁灭了，主人得救了，恢复正常了，他自由了！接着，山姆才注意到那只流血的手。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, this is the end, Sam Gamgee," said a voice by his side. And there was Frodo, pale and worn, and yet himself again; and in his eyes there was peace now, neither strain of will, nor madness, nor any fear. His burden was taken away. There was the dear master of the sweet days in the Shire.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“山姆—詹吉，看来这就是结局了！”一个声音从山姆身边冒出来，脸色苍白的佛罗多就站在那边，却已经恢复了正常，他的眼中只剩下祥和，没有压抑、没有疯狂、没有恐惧。他的重担已经卸下了，这又是山姆在夏尔时最亲爱的主人了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Your poor hand!" he said. "And I have nothing to bind it with, or comfort it. I would have spared him a whole hand of mine rather. But he's gone now beyond recall, gone for ever."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes," said Frodo. "But do you remember Gandalf's words: Even Gollum may have something yet to do? But for him, Sam, I could not have destroyed the Ring. The Quest would have been in vain, even at the bitter end. So let us forgive him! For the Quest is achieved, and now all is over. I am glad you are here with me. Here at the end of all things, Sam."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，”佛罗多说：“你还记得甘道夫说的话吗？即使咕鲁，都可能还有他的使命要完成。山姆，如果没有他，我根本不可能摧毁魔戒。整个任务可能会前功尽弃，甚至是落到悲惨的下场。我们就原谅他吧！任务已经完成了，一切都结束了。我很高兴你在我身边，山姆，这是一切事物的终结。”">查看中文翻译</div>
