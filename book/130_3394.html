<div class="line_en">Suddenly, there before me stood two extremely shy‚ blushing youths in their circumcision outfits. They wore two long robes, one blue, one white. Buffalo horns were bound round their necks with the thick, coarse cloth that is used to wrap corpses and buy women. On their backs, they wore leopard skins stretched over wooden frames. Here there had been some element of compromise with the modern world. Leopards are now extinct in the area and the Nigerian mountains are the only current source of illegal imports of such skins at ruinous cost. One enterprising local trader has plugged the gap by importing a cotton fabric with leopard-skin markings on it. It was this that was sported by one of the youths, in place of the real skin. Knowing the Dowayos' difficulties in this area, I had brought with me a supply of leopard-skin Fablon with which English dandies are wont to ornament the insides of their cars. When I showed it to Zuuldibo, it went down very well, its stiffness and washability being deemed major advances over the natural product.</div>

<div class="line_en">In accordance with Dowayo norms of hospitality, I gave one of them a small present and offered some beer. All the while, I was uncomfortably aware that in decorating either of them I had accepted new social obligations, becoming the boy's "husband" -- a relationship that lasts for life and would involve me in dressing and feeding him at the end of circumcision.

<div class="line_en">Zuuldibo, with his uncanny beer-scenting abilities, immediately appeared and watched the boys drinking rather as a dog hovers around a child with an ice-cream. His hat was a trifle askew. It was clear that he had come hot from a beer-drinking party in the fields. Having finally caught my circumcision candidates, fine specimens of about fourteen, I was loth to release them too easily and interrogated them mercilessly about their parentage, what preparations had already been made, who would be organizing the ceremony and other details. Soon they were yawning pitiably, leaning against each other and demanding sleep. Zuuldibo, moreover, had decided that this was the best time to address the problem of the roof of my hut.

<div class="line_en">This is a frequent ploy to stop haggling, shame often driving the buyer to offer far more than he would otherwise be prepared to pay. Zuuldibo was obviously in his cups or he would clearly see that he was leaving himself open to the most straightforward debt-bandying. Zuuldibo owed me money. I would owe Zuuldibo money. When he asked for payment for the roof, I could simply annul his debt and leave him to face the workers. It was an attractive idea but I knew I could never do it. My own notions of responsibility and shame would prevent it. I would feel guilt every time I saw the men and they looked disappointed.</div>

<div class="line_en">The roof, he observed, spreading himself easily on the ground and breaking wind -- a friendly mark that we were in all-male company and could discourse freely -- had been a very fine roof. He himself had supervised the thatching of it because I was his friend. I could not resist interjecting that it had leaked badly from the start but Zuuldibo waved this remark aside. The boys dozed. We were obviously to suffer a prepared speech. The roof, Zuuldibo asserted, had been remarkably fine and much admired. It had been fitting for a man of wealth such as myself. But now it was leaking. Zuuldibo suffered when he was inside guarding the hut. He was glad to suffer for me, his friend, without payment, but I would need a new roof. How much would it cost? It was‚ he felt, unseemly to discuss such matters. Zuuldibo would take upon himself the execution of necessary works. He would ensure it was well done. I would give him what I felt was proper reward for the heavy sufferings of the workers.</div>

<div class="line_en">Zuuldibo waxed ebullient. Beer was called for, a small furtive boy being sent to secure supplies from wife number two. He leaned back under a tree and warmed to his theme. He had, it seemed, also been giving thought to his own status. It was assumed, naturally, that he would be accompanying me to all festivals concerned with circumcision. The difficulty lay in his umbrella.</div>

<div class="line_en">The English notion of the thatcher deriving rural satisfaction from the leisurely toil of skilled hands bears little relationship to the task of covering an African roof. The grass used emits huge quantities of suffocating pollen, causing appalling rashes and choking fits. After a day's work, thatchers would often be found gasping for breath, broiling in the hot sun. The associations of the job are closer to those of coal-mining than weaving.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="英国人印象中的铺屋顶是以熟练双手轻松完成，从中得到田园式乐趣，铺非洲茅屋则完全是两回事。屋顶使用的草会飞出大量令人窒息的花粉，导致恐怖的红疹、呛个不止。一整天下来，铺屋顶的工人往往呛得喘不上气、被太阳晒到昏头。相较于编织茅草，铺屋顶像是在矿坑工作。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The anthropologist is a great nuisance in any village, constantly harassing innocent people with trying questions. He draws heavily upon reserves of patience and goodwill. It is unreasonable for him to refuse to make some small contribution to the community in which he lives. Thatching is, moreover, a very unpleasant job whose discomforts had been only marginally overstated by Zuuldibo.</div>

<div class="line_en">Traditionally, the chiefs of West Africa are shaded by red umbrellas. Sometimes, these become regalia of great artistic elaboration and are much ornamented and embellished with rare vehemence. Zuuldibo had settled for a much less complex expedient and bought a red lady's umbrella made in Hong Kong. In illustration of his point, he drew it forth from beneath his robes, opened it and assumed an expression of extreme idiocy, tongue lolling out of his mouth, eyes wild. Everyone laughed.

<div class="line_en">The problem lies in the fact that the Dowayos have no notion of our institution of "toasting". All they have is an institution of cursing. When wronged beyond human bearing, a man may curse another by calling out his name, sipping beer and spitting the contents of his mouth on to the earth. It is then expected that the victim will weaken and die, especially if he is in a relation of dependence to the man who has cursed him -- for example, if he is his son.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="问题出在多瓦悠文化并无“举杯致敬”的制度（institution）（1）。他们只有咒语制度。一个人如遭到无法忍受的不当对待，便可以诅咒对方，喊出对方的名、饮一口啤酒啐到地上。对方就会越来越虚弱，而后死亡，诅咒者与被诅咒者如有依存关系（譬如是他的儿子），咒语会特别灵。【注：（1）institution指的是已建立的一套社会文化惯例（usage），被当作一个族群之社会组织的一种恒久部分而被采用。详见芮逸夫，前揭书，第167页。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Being punctilious in matters of etiquette, Zuuldibo poured a healthy draught of the turgid, bubbling liquid into a calabash and took a single matronly sip to show that nothing detrimental to the well-being of his guests was intended. He then proffered it to me. Possibly I was infected by his own courtliness. Whatever the reason, instead of simply draining the cup as would have been expected‚ I held it up and proclaimed Zuuldibo's name in a toast. Immediately, a deep and shocked silence descended upon the gathering. The boys stopped talking. Zuuldibo's smile froze upon his face. The very flies seemed hushed from their buzzing. I knew, as everyone knows who works in an alien culture, that I had made a serious mistake.</div>

<div class="line_en">The boys rose and pattered away lightly down the path, being soon swallowed up by the tall grass, the jangling bells around their ankles coming back in waves. Abruptly a new sound took over. It was a motorbike, a suzukiyo in Dowayo. The arrival of a motorbike in the village is not an everyday occurrence and we all rushed down to the cactus hedge around the village to see who it was. The sound died away as the machine descended into a dip. Then, astride a wildly bucking machine, there appeared a gendarme with an automatic carbine slung over his back. Zuuldibo and I looked at each other in unspoken recognition of the fact that he had come for one of us. Swiftly, he folded his comic umbrella and slipped away, knees bent like Groucho Marx lest his head appear above the hedge. It seemed I stood alone. People fled in all directions, rather as if a visit by Attila the Hun had been announced. There followed a pause while the gendarme parked his bike and threatened various forms of physical dismemberment to the crowd of children if they touched his machine. He appeared somewhat diffidently in the gateway, dropped his carbine and shook hands with me. To my relief I recognized him as one of the pleasant idlers from the police post. As we entered my hut, I had a moment's dread of finding Zuuldibo there but it was empty.</div>

<div class="line_en">My visit was quite astonishingly uncomplicated. The sous-préfet was at home, free and willing to see me. He waved me inside and listened to my story. My passport was inspected. After a swift perusal, he stabbed it with his finger. "Here is the trouble. They gave you a provisional visa in the capital, not a temporary one." There indeed was the visa, a head with an insulting caricature of the profile of an African woman. Inevitably, I thought of Precocious and his hideous ivory pendants. Beside it, were stamped the doom-laden words "valid for three weeks, non-renewable". With a deft hand, the sous-préfet simply deleted the non-renewable clause and stamped it. "You had better go to Garoua," he urged. "I will write you a note to the prefect."</div>

<div class="line_en">The message had come over the radio this morning and the captain had sent him out to find me. He looked coy and regarded his feet with rapt attention. He could, of course, always tell the captain I had been away in the bush so that he had been forced to leave a note on my door. This would give me time to see the sous-préfet before the police got hold of me. He would even give me a lift into town on the back of his motorbike if I would promise to jump off and hide if anyone came the other way.</div>

<div class="line_en">So, far from being shipped off in chains as I had imagined, I ended up being chauffeur-driven. Such violent alternations of fortune work powerfully upon the mind. Anthropologists are perhaps distinguished by possessing a supplementary gear into which they can drop in the face of frustration and disaster. It is a state almost of suspended animation, devoid of emotion, in which the most fearful misfortunes or accretions of minor irritations simply wash over the fieldworker in a way that would astonish friends and relations at home who may know the person concerned as energetic and incisive.</div>

It was handled with great circumspection as if it might turn out to be important evidence against me. "What is your connection with the sous-préfet?" asked one hostile official. "He married my sister." The official nodded sagaciously. Soon my passport sported a new visa in defiance of the non-renewable clause. The official smiled. "There is one problem. You need a 200-franc fiscal stamp." He shrugged. "We have none. There are no 200-franc fiscal stamps in the city." He leaned forward. "If you meet me behind the building in ten minutes.
