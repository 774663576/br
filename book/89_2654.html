<div class="line_en">To begin with, Britt-Marie slept all night through for the first time since she had come to Borg. She slept the unreflective sleep of a child, and she woke up in great spirits. Another day. This alone should immediately have made her suspicious, because little good can come of waking up all enthusiastic like that. She leapt out of bed and immediately started cleaning Bank's kitchen. Not because she needed to but rather because Bank wasn't at home and the kitchen was just there when Britt-Marie came down the stairs. Simply put, she had never met a kitchen she did not want to clean. After this was done, she took a walk through Borg to the recreation center. Then cleaned it from top to bottom. Made sure all the pictures were hanging straight, even the ones with soccer balls in them. She stood absolutely still in front of them and looked at her reflection in the glass of the frames.</div>

<div class="line_en">Today is the day after, and it's one of the absolute worst days of Britt-Marie's life. She has a bump on her head and apparently she has broken two fingers. At least that is what Ben's mother tells her, and Ben's mother is a nurse, after all, so Britt-Marie has to assume she is qualified to comment on such matters. They are sitting on a little bench behind a curtain at a hospital in town. Britt-Marie has a Band-Aid on her forehead and her hand in a bandage, and she's doing her absolute utmost not to cry. Ben's mother keeps her hand on her sore wrist, but she doesn't ask how all this happened. Britt-Marie is grateful for that, because she'd rather no one ever found out.</div>

<div class="line_en">With this thought in mind Britt-Marie set off for the pizzeria, to wake up Somebody. They drank coffee and Britt-Marie inquired in a friendly way about postcards and whether Somebody happened to stock them. Somebody did indeed. They were extremely old and had the caption "Welcome to Borg" written across them. That was how you knew they were old, said Somebody; it was a long time since anyone uttered those words.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她这样想着，慢慢走到披萨店，叫坐轮椅的女人起床，两人一起喝了咖啡。布里特—玛丽友好地问她有没有明信片，坐轮椅的女人表示店里有些库存，但它们早已过时，因为上面一律印着“欢迎来到博格”的标语。有没有这句话是判断过时与否的标准，坐轮椅的女人说，人们已经很少喊这种口号了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Britt-Marie wrote a postcard to Kent. Her message was very short. "Hello. This is from Britt-Marie. Sorry for all the pain I have caused you. I hope you are feeling well. I hope you have clean shirts. Your electric shaver is in the third drawer in the bathroom. If you need to get onto the balcony to polish the windows you have to wiggle the door handle a bit, pull it towards you, and give the door a little shove. There is Faxin in the broom cupboard." She wanted to describe how much she missed him. But didn't. Didn't want to cause any bother.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布里特—玛丽给肯特写了一张明信片，只有很短的几句话：“你好。我是布里特—玛丽。很抱歉给你带来那么多的痛苦。希望你过得好，有干净衬衣穿。你的电动剃须刀在浴室第三个抽屉里。要是你打算去阳台擦窗户，先抓住门把手晃几下，朝你的方向拉，再用力推一下门。扫帚柜里有菲克新。”她想说说她是如何想念他的，但没有写上去。还是别找麻烦了吧。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then she rubbed the white mark on her ring finger. People who have not worn a wedding ring for almost their entire lives are unaware of how a mark like that looks. Some people take theirs off from time to time -- while doing the washing-up, for instance -- but Britt-Marie had never once taken off her ring until the day she took it off once and for all. So the white mark is permanent, as if her skin had another color when she was married. As if this is what is left of her, underneath, if you scrape off everything she turned into.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布里特—玛丽揉了揉无名指上的白印子。没戴过那么长时间婚戒的人，是想象不出那是一道怎样的白印子的。有些人会时不时把他们的婚戒摘下来——比方说在洗碗的时候——但是在永久性地把它摘掉之前，布里特—玛丽从来没这么干过，所以她的白印子也是永久性的，仿佛那种白色才是她的本色，仿佛婚后的岁月给她镀上一层新的颜色，如果把它刮掉，她的全身都会变回本色，和白印子一样白。">查看中文翻译</div>

Then she went to the recreation center, left the front door ajar, and put a plate with the Snickers on the threshold. Next to the plate she put a note, written neatly in ink: "Out on a date. Or a meeting. Or whatever it's called nowadays. No need to put away your plate when you have finished, it's no trouble at all for me." She wanted to write something about how she hoped the rat would find someone else to share its dinner with, because she did not feel the rat deserved to eat alone. Loneliness is a waste of both rats and people. But her common sense ordered her not to get involved in the rat's personal choices about social relationships, so she left it at that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布里特—玛丽用买来的玻璃纸——然而她根本没看出价格里包含了什么友情——包装了啤酒瓶，在顶端系了个蝴蝶结，总之该有的装饰都有了。她回到娱乐中心，虚掩着前门，把盛着士力架的碟子摆在门口，还在碟子旁边留了张字条，上面用墨水工整地写道：“外出约会，或者说见面去了，或者随便怎么说，总之你吃完以后无需把碟子放回去，这不会给我添麻烦。”她还想告诉老鼠，希望它能找到可以共进晚餐的同类，因为她觉得老鼠不应该一只鼠吃饭。一只鼠的孤独意味着两只鼠在一起的机会被浪费了，对人类来说也是这样。但常识命令她不要干涉老鼠的社交，所以她并没有把这些话写上去。">查看中文翻译</div>

Once she had made sure that no one could see her, she briskly set off for the bus stop on the road leading out of Borg in two directions and left in one of those two available directions on a bus. It felt like an adventure. Like freedom. Not to the extent that she was unconcerned about the state of the seat, obviously, so she tidily spread four white napkins over it before sitting down.

<div class="line_en">Britt-Marie is no connoisseur when it comes to solariums, and as a result she was possibly not very familiar with the basic functions of the machine. Her idea had been to sit on a stool next to the lit-up bed, sticking her hand into the light, and gently closing the lid on top of it. How long she would have to sit there bronzing her hand into one without a white mark on it she did not know, but she imagined that the process could not be more elaborate than cooking salmon in the oven. Her plan was to simply remove her hand now and then and see how it was all going.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布里特—玛丽不是日光浴方面的内行，所以她并不熟悉机器的功能。她的设想是坐在塑料床旁边的凳子上，左手放在灯管上面，然后轻轻合上塑料床的盖子，至于多长时间能把无名指上的白印子烤黑，她心里也没谱，但她觉得整个过程不会比烤三文鱼更复杂，应该可以时不时地抽出手来检查一下效果，就像开烤箱检查鱼熟了没有那样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It must have been something to do with the soporific humming of the machine, perhaps, as well as the heat of it, especially as she had gone around all day being enthusiastic -- that was how it happened. Her head slumped, as one's head has a way of doing when one goes to sleep on a stool, and then her forehead struck the lid of the tanning machine very hard, and her hand got horribly twisted under the lid. She rolled onto the floor and passed out, and now she's in the hospital. With a bump on her head and broken fingers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不知是机器嗡嗡叫的声音太催眠，还是它太热，再加上她已经精神百倍地四处晃荡了一天——总之事情就这么发生了：她坐在日光浴机旁边的凳子上睡着了，脑门磕在机器的盖子上，肿起一个大包，手也被盖子狠狠地夹了一下。她滚到地板上，晕了过去，后来被人送到医院，带着脑袋上的包和两根受伤的手指头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Britt-Marie may want to retort something, but humiliation and common sense compel her to leave the room. The children from the soccer team are sitting in the waiting room. Quite decimated, Britt-Marie avoids their eyes. This is something new to her -- the feeling of having yearned for something, only to collapse on the ground. Britt-Marie is not used to hoping.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布里特—玛丽也许想反驳来着，但屈辱和常识迫使她离开了房间。足球队的孩子们坐在候诊室里，她疲惫不堪地躲避着他们的目光，这种感觉对她来说也是全新的——渴望某样东西，却跌倒在地。布里特—玛丽从来没有渴望什么的习惯。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No, they don't," says Britt-Marie, so that her voice cracks. She slips off the bench. Ben's mother holds out her hand but Britt-Marie glides away. "Enough people in Borg are giving up, Britt-Marie. Don't become one of them, please."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Well, ah, I thought that… well, I thought you wouldn't want to go to the restaurant now… after all this, so I made a picnic.

<div class="line_en">He tries to say something when they stop, but she gets out before he has time. He's still standing outside his police car with his cap in his hands when she closes the front door. She stands motionless on the other side, holding her breath until he leaves.</div>

<div class="line_en">So Sven drives her to Bank's house, even though she wishes he wouldn't. And wishes he'd never seen her like this.
