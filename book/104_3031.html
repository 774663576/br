<div class="line_en">Imagine me, reader, with my shyness, my distaste for any ostentation, my inherent sense of the comme il faut, imagine me masking the frenzy of my grief with a trembling ingratiating smile while devising some casual pretext to flip through the hotel register: "Oh," I would say, "I am almost positive that I stayed here once -- let me look up the entries for mid-June -- no, I see I'm wrong after all -- what a very quaint name for a home town, Kawtagain. Thanks very much." Or: "I had a customer staying here -- I mislaid his address -- may I…?" And every once in a while, especially if the operator of the place happened to be a certain type of gloomy male, personal inspection of the books was denied me.</div>

<div class="line_en">A thousand-mile stretch of silk-smooth road separated Kasbeam, where, to the best of my belief, the red fiend had been scheduled to appear for the first time, and fateful Elphinstone which we had reached about a week before Independence Day. The journey had taken up most of June for we had seldom made more than a hundred and fifty miles per traveling day, spending the rest of the time, up to five days in one case, at various stopping places, all of them also prearranged, no doubt. It was that stretch, then, along which the fiend's spoor should be sought; and to this I devoted myself, after several unmentionable days of dashing up and down the relentlessly radiating roads in the vicinity of Elphinstone.</div>

<div class="line_en">I have a memo here: between July 5 and November 18, when I returned to Beardsley for a few days, I registered, if not actually stayed, at 342 hotels, motels and tourist homes. This figure includes a few registrations between Chestnut and Beardsley, one of which yielded a shadow of the fiend ("N. Petit, Larousse, III."); I had to space and time my inquiries carefully so as not to attract undue attention; and there must have been at least fifty places where I merely inquired at the desk -- but that was a futile quest, and I preferred building up a foundation of verisimilitude and good will by first paying for an unneeded room. My survey showed that of the 300 or so books inspected, at least 20 provided me with a clue: the loitering fiend had stopped even more often than we, or else -- he was quite capable of that -- he had thrown in additional registrations in order to keep me well furnished with derisive hints. Only in one case had he actually stayed at the same motor court as we, a few paces from Lolita's pillow. In some instances he had taken up quarters in the same or in a neighboring block; not infrequently he had lain in wait at an intermediate spot between two bespoken points. How vividly I recalled Lolita, just before our departure from Beardsley, prone on the parlor rug, studying tour books and maps, and marking laps and stops with her lipstick!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我这儿有个备忘录：七月五日到十一月十八日之间，回比尔兹利过了几天，我在三百四十四家旅馆、汽车旅馆和旅客之家登过记，但实际并没住下。这个数字里也包括切斯纳特和比尔兹利之间的几个登记处，其中有一家那魔鬼的影子闪现过；我得小心翼翼分地点，分时间查询，以免引起不必要的注意；至少有五十个地方。我只是在问询处问了几句——但这种调查往往毫无结果。所以，我宁愿先花钱租一个根本用不着的房间，建立一个逼真的根据地和一副善心善意。我查阅过的大约三百本登记簿中，至少有二十本提供了一些蛛丝马迹：那四处游荡的魔鬼，一路上停留的次数甚至比我们还要多；或者说———他很机灵———故意另外多做了些登记，好让我总是受用他那些嘲弄性的暗示。只有一次，他与我们住在同一家汽车旅店里，离洛丽塔的枕头只有几步。还有几次他就与我们住在同一条街上或相邻的那条。不少次见他在两个预定旅馆之间的路上埋伏下来等待。我想起了洛丽塔，多么生动，就在我们要离开比尔兹利之前，我们俯在客厅里的地毯上，研究旅游书和旅游图，用她的唇膏在上面画出行程范围和停留地点！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I discovered at once that he had foreseen my investigations and had planted insulting pseudonyms for my special benefit. At the very first motel office I visited, Ponderosa Lodge, his entry, among a dozen obviously human ones, read: Dr. Gratiano Forbeson, Mirandola, NY. Its Italian Comedy connotations could not fail to strike me, of course. The landlady deigned to inform me that the gentleman had been laid up for five days with a bad cold, that he had left his car for repairs in some garage or other and that he had checked out on the 4th of July. Yes, a girl called Ann Lore had worked formerly at the Lodge, but was now married to a grocer in Cedar City. One moonlit night I waylaid white-shoed Mary on a solitary street; an automaton, she was about to shriek, but I managed to humanize her by the simple act of falling on my knees and with pious yelps imploring her to help. She did not know a thing, she swore. Who was this Gratiano Forbeson? She seemed to waver. I whipped out a hundred-dollar bill. She lifted it to the light of the moon. "He is your brother," she whispered at last. I plucked the bill out of her moon-cold hand, and spitting out a French curse turned and ran away. This taught me to rely on myself alone. No detective could discover the clues Trapp had tuned to my mind and manner. I could not hope, of course, he would ever leave his correct name and address; but I did hope he might slip on the glaze of his own subtlety, by daring, say, to introduce a richer and more personal shot of color than was strictly necessary, or by revealing too much through a qualitative sum of quantitative parts which revealed too little. In one thing he succeeded: he succeeded in thoroughly enmeshing me and my thrashing anguish in his demoniacal game. With infinite skill, he swayed and staggered, and regained an impossible balance, always leaving me with the sportive hope -- if I may use such a term in speaking of betrayal, fury, desolation, horror and hate -- that he might give himself away next time. He never did -- though coming damn close to it. We all admire the spangled acrobat with classical grace meticulously walking his tight rope in the talcum light; but how much rarer art there is in the sagging rope expert wearing scarecrow clothes and impersonating a grotesque drunk! I should know.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="很快我就发现，他早就预料到我会来调查，因此，已计划好用带侮辱意味的假名来气我。我拜访的第一家汽车旅店名叫庞德罗萨旅馆，在办公室里，他的登记混在十几个人的手迹中，是这样的：格雷希思诺福本森博士，来自纽约州米兰多拉。当然，他这意大利喜剧式的含蓄会给我留下深刻印象的。女店主放下架子告诉我，这位先生曾患了重感冒，一连五天卧床不起。他把车子留在什么修车厂修理了，七月四日，付清了帐。是的，有一个姑娘叫安洛尔的，以前在旅馆里工作过，现在嫁给了锡达城的一个杂货商。一个月夜，在一条寂静的街上，我拦住了穿白鞋子的玛丽，她象台自动机器，刚要尖声喊叫，我扑通一声跪在地上，给她恢复了个性，虔诚地叫着，乞求她的帮助。她什么都不知道，她发誓。格雷希思诺。福本森是谁？她象在犹豫。我唰地拿出一张一百美元的钞票。她把票子举到月光下。最后，她小声说：“他是你哥哥。”我一把将钞票从她冰冷的手里抢回来。丢下一句法语脏话，转身跑去。这件事告诉我我只能靠自己。任何一个侦探也发现不了特拉普为适应我的头脑和方式而整理好的线索。当然我不能奢望他还会留下真正的姓名和住址；但我确实盼望他机关算尽反会失足。比如说，池没准在不恰当的时候，穿了一身色彩绚丽、个性极强的衣服；再比如，他的破绽在定性的总体上肯定会有所暴露，尽管量的各部分并不能说明什么。然而有一点他成功了：他成功地让我不折不扣地上了他的当；而且，让我在他这恶魔的游戏中不胜苦恼。他的惊人的技巧，东摇摇西晃晃，又总能恢复平衡，今人难以置信，又总能留给我些许多希望——如果我能用这个词来讲述诱惑、愤怒、孤寂、恐惧和仇恨——我的希望就是下一次他或许会牺牲掉自己。他从来没有牺牲过——尽管有几次只差一点点。我们都钦佩那些杂技演员，身着闪光彩衣，在镁光灯下，典雅而谨慎地走在他的绷索上；但是衣不蔽体、专模仿古怪醉汉的走弯索专家的身上有多少更珍奇的艺术呢？我应该知道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He was versed in logodaedaly and logomancy. He was an amateur of sex lore. He had a feminine handwriting. He would change his name but he could not disguise, no matter how he slanted them, his very peculiar t's, w's and I's. Quelquepart Island was one of his favorite residences. He did not use a fountain pen which fact, as any psychoanalyst will tell you, meant that the patient was a repressed undinist. One mercifully hopes there are water nymphs in the Styx.</div>

<div class="line_en">The clues he left did not establish his identity but they reflected his personality, or at least a certain homogenous and striking personality; his genre, his type of humor -- at its best at least -- the tone of his brain, had affinities with my own. He mimed and mocked me. His allusions were definitely highbrow. He was well-read. He knew French.</div>

<div class="line_en">His main trait was his passion for tantalization. Goodness, what a tease the poor fellow was! He challenged my scholarship. I am sufficiently proud of my knowing something to be modest about my not knowing all; and I daresay I missed some elements in that cryptogrammic paper chase. What a shiver of triumph and loathing shook my frail frame when, among the plain innocent names in the hotel recorder, his fiendish conundrum would ejaculate in my face! I noticed that whenever he felt his enigmas were becoming too recondite, even for such a solver as I, he would lure me back with an easy one. "Arsène Lupin" was obvious to a Frenchman who remembered the detective stories of his youth; and one hardly had to be a Coleridgian to appreciate the trite poke of "A. Person, Porlock, England." In horrible taste but basically suggestive of a cultured man -- not a policeman, not a common goon, not a lewd salesman -- were such assumed names as "Arthur Rainbow"-- plainly the travestied author of Le Bateau Bleu -- let me laugh a little too, gentlemen -- and "Morris Schmetterling," of L'Oiseau Ivre fame (touché, reader!). The silly but funny 'D. Orgon, Elmira, NY," was from Molière, of course, and because I had quite recently tried to interest Lolita in a famous 18th-century play, I welcomed as an old friend "Harry Bumper, Sheridan, Wyo." An ordinary encyclopedia informed me who the peculiar looking "Phineas Quimby, Lebanon, NH" was; and any good Freudian, with a German name and some interest in religious prostitution, should recognize at a glance the implication of "Dr. Kitzler, Eryx, Miss." So far so good. That sort of fun was shoddy but on the whole impersonal and thus innocuous. Among entries that arrested my attention as undoubtable clues per se but baffled me in respect to their finer points I do not care to mention many since I feel I am groping in a border-land mist with verbal phantoms turning, perhaps, into living vacationists. Who was "Johnny Randall, Ramble, Ohio"? Or was he a real person who just happened to write a hand similar to "N. S. Aristoff, Catagela, NY"? What was the sting in "Catagela"? And what about "James Mavor Morell, Hoaxton, England"? "Aristophanes," "hoax"-- fine, but what was I missing?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="极其喜好捉弄人是他的主要特点。天哪，他是个怎样的家伙！他专向我的学识挑战。我知道某事，会满心自豪，不太了解，会谦逊恭顺；我敢说，在这场字谜游戏的追逐中，我漏了一些基本要素。当他那可恶难解的字谜从登记簿里其他名字中一下子突出在我的眼前时，我孱弱身躯是怎样因兴奋、同时也因憎恨而颤抖不已呵！我发现每当他觉得他的字谜对我这样的解谜能手来说也过分深奥、难测，他就会用一个容易的名字，再把我诱进圈套。“阿尔塞纳吕班”这个名字，对一个对年轻时读过的侦探故事仍记忆尤新的法国人来说，再明白不过。你也不必非得处在柯勒律治生活的年代去理解那个陈旧的惰汉“英格兰波洛克城的埃．珀森。”一个受过教育的人，以他可怕但基本上是有益的欣赏趣味——不是警察的，不是一般暴徒的，不是好色的推销员的——喜欢采用诸如“阿瑟雷思博”的假名。是他篡改了《蓝舟》作者的名字——让我也笑一笑吧，先生们——还有“莫里斯．施梅待林”’《快活鸟》的作者（有联系的，读者！）。而愚蠢又可笑的“纽约，爱尔米拉市拉布德奥根”无疑出自莫里哀的戏剧。因为前不久，我刚刚费了不少力气想激起洛丽塔对一出十八世纪名剧的兴趣，所以又象接待者朋友那样看到了“怀我明，谢里登市的哈里邦泊”。一本普通的百科全书为我解释了那个书写很奇特的“新罕布什尔，莱巴顿市菲尼亚斯奎昆比”是谁；任何一个精神分析学的忠实信徒，并且有一德国名，还对滥用宗教感些兴趣，一眼就该看出来“密西西比，爱利克斯，基茨勒博士”指的是什么。到目前为止，一切还算顺利。这类玩闹质量很低劣，但总的看来，还是属于有规律的，因此并无贻害。有些登记很吸引我的注意力，好象是淡紫色的确切线索，可一经深查细究，立刻就被困惑住。我不想再多罗列，因为我觉得我正在一团满是辞语鬼怪的迷雾里摸索着，没淮这些鬼怪会突然变成活生生的度假人。谁是“俄亥俄兰姆堡的约翰尼兰德尔”？他就是那个刚巧留下了与“纽约，凯塔基拉，图斯阿里斯托夫”相似笔迹的人吗？“英人，霍克斯顿，詹姆斯．梅弗莫雷尔”又是个什么人？“阿里斯托芬斯”、“骗局”——很好，但我没领会的是什么呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The garbled license numbers left by all these Persons and Orgons and Morells and Trapps only told me that motel keepers omit to check if guests' cars are accurately listed. References -- incompletely or incorrectly indicated -- to the cars the fiend had hired for short laps between Wace and Elphinstone were of course useless; the license of the initial Aztec was a shimmer of shifting numerals, some transposed, others altered or omitted, but somehow forming interrelated combinations (such as "WS 1564" and "SH 1616," and "Q32888" or "CU 88322") which however were so cunningly contrived as to never reveal a common denominator.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所有这些珀森们、奥根们、莫雷尔们，特拉普们在旅馆里登记的车牌号都是窜改过了的，这只能告诉我，汽车旅馆的经营者们都没有核实过旅客登记的车牌号是不是准确。在韦斯和埃尔芬斯通之间，那魔鬼每隔一小段路程便另租一辆车，关于这些车掌握的材料既不完全又不准确，显然毫元用处。他最早的那辆阿兹特克轿车车牌，数字也改动过了，有些是互换位置，其他的用别的数字代替或干脆省去不用，但不知怎么结果还总是根互联系的联合体（如”w s1564”，“SH1616”’“Q32888”或“Cu88322”），不过这种联合体设计得是那样精巧，绝表现不出其命名人都是同一个。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was one strain running through all that pseudonymity which caused me especially painful palpitations when I came across it. Such things as "G. Trapp, Geneva, NY." was the sign of treachery on Lolita's part. "Aubrey Beardsley, Quelquepart Island" suggested more lucidly than the garbled telephone message had that the starting point of the affair should be looked for in the East. "Lucas Picador, Merrymay, Pa." insinuated that my Carmen had betrayed my pathetic endearments to the impostor. Horribly cruel, forsooth, was "Will Brown, Dolores, Colo." The gruesome "Harold Haze, Tombstone, Arizona" (which at another time would have appealed to my sense of humor) implied a familiarity with the girl's past that in nightmare fashion suggested for a moment that my quarry was an old friend of the family, maybe an old flame of Charlotte's, maybe a redresser of wrongs ("Donald Quix, Sierra, Nev."). But the most penetrating bodkin was the anagramtailed entry in the register of Chestnut Lodge "Ted Hunter, Cane, NH.".</div>
