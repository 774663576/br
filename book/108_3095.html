<div class="line_en">So Ove had time to think of many different things. Mainly radiators.</div>

<div class="line_en">They say the brain functions quicker while it's falling. As if the sudden explosion of kinetic energy forces the mental faculties to accelerate until the perception of the exterior world goes into slow motion.</div>

<div class="line_en">Because there are right and wrong ways of doing things, as we all know. And even though it was many years ago and Ove could no longer remember exactly what solution he'd considered to be the right one in the argument about which central heating system should be adopted by the Residents' Association, he did remember very clearly that Rune's approach to it had been wrong.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因为我们都知道凡事都有对错两种方式。虽然那是多年以前的事，欧维现在已经无法准确地回忆起当时社区在讨论该使用哪种中央供暖系统时自己提议了哪种，但他清楚记得，反正鲁尼的方法是错的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ove could not in all honesty remember how it all started. It wasn't the sort of dispute where you did remember. It was more an argument where the little disagreements had ended up so entangled that every new word was treacherously booby-trapped, and in the end it wasn't possible to open one's mouth at all without setting off at least four unexploded mines from earlier conflicts. It was the sort of argument that had just run, and run, and run. Until one day it just ran out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说实话，欧维也不知道是从哪天开始的。不是那种让人印象深刻的纠葛，是那种所有小矛盾纠结在一起的纠葛，以至于每句新说出口的话都像踩到了地雷，不重新引爆四个以上老矛盾就根本没法开口。这样的纠葛一而再再而三地蔓延，直到有一天终于耗尽了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But it wasn't just the central heating system. Rune and Ove had known one another for almost forty years, and they had been at loggerheads for at least thirty-seven of them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="另外，这不仅仅是中央供暖系统的问题。鲁尼和欧维相识了四十年，而他们不和至少也得有三十七个年头了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ove recalled that he had at least not disliked Rune in those early years, as far as he could remember. They were the ones who set up the Residents' Association, Ove as chairman and Rune as assistant chairman. They had stuck together when the council wanted to cut down the forest behind Ove's and Rune's houses in order to build even more houses. Of course, the council claimed that those construction plans had been there for years before Rune and Ove moved into their houses, but one did not get far with Rune and Ove using that sort of argumentation. "It's war, you bastards!" Rune had roared at them down the telephone line. And it truly was: endless appeals and writs and petitions and letters to newspapers. A year and a half later the council gave up and started building somewhere else instead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维记得，早些年里，他并没有那么不喜欢鲁尼，至少在印象中是这样。社区委员会的领导班子就是他俩一起建立的。欧维是会长，鲁尼是副会长。市政府想要砍掉欧维和鲁尼家背后的树林造新房子的时候，也是欧维和鲁尼站在了同一条战线上。市政府当然声称规划方案早在鲁尼和欧维搬进小区之前就已经决定，但这种强词夺理在鲁尼和欧维面前是行不通的。“这是宣战，你们这群浑蛋！”鲁尼在电话里冲他们吼，然后战争就爆发了。上法庭打官司上访请愿外加给报社写投诉信。一年半之后，市政府缴械投降，开始找别的地方造房子去了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It wasn't really about cars, properly speaking. But Ove drove a Saab, after all. And Rune drove a Volvo. Anyone could have seen it wouldn't work out in the long run. In the beginning, though, they had been friends. Or, at least, friends to the extent that men like Ove and Rune were capable of being friends. Mostly for the sake of their wives, obviously. All four of them had moved into the area at the same time, and Sonja and Anita became instant best friends as only women married to men like Ove and Rune can be.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其实跟车没有什么关系。但欧维开的是萨博，而鲁尼开的是沃尔沃。所有人都应该知道，这种情况往往好景不长。但其实一开始他们是好伙伴，或者说，至少欧维和鲁尼这样的人有可能建立起最佳伙伴关系。这当然大都是因为他们的太太。他们同时搬进这个小区，索雅和安妮塔立马成了最亲密的朋友，所有嫁给欧维和鲁尼这类男人的女人大约都会这样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Is no one prepared to fight for their principles anymore?" Rune had wondered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这年头已经没人坚持原则了吗？”鲁尼问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That evening Rune and Ove had drunk a glass of whiskey each on Rune's patio. They didn't seem overly happy about winning, their wives pointed out. Both men were rather disappointed that the council had given up so quickly. These eighteen months had been some of the most enjoyable of their lives.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天晚上，鲁尼和欧维在鲁尼家的院子里小酌了几杯威士忌。其实赢得这场胜利并没有让他们喜出望外，他们的太太都看了出来。两个男人对市政府这么快就罢手都颇感失望。这可是两个男人生命中最有意思的十八个月。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And then they said a toast to unworthy enemies.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后他们为不值一提的敌人干了一杯。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Not a damn one," Ove had answered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“连个还嘴的都没有。”欧维回答。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That was long before the coup d'état in the Residents' Association, of course. And before Rune bought a BMW.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，那是老早之前的事，彼时，社区委员会还没发生政变，鲁尼也还没买那辆宝马。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ove wasn't hopeless, in his own view. He just had a sense of there needing to be a bit of order in the greater scheme of things. He felt one should not go through life as if everything was exchangeable. As if loyalty was worthless. Nowadays people changed their stuff so often that any expertise in how to make things last was becoming superfluous. Quality: no one cared about that anymore. Not Rune or the other neighbors and not those managers in the place where Ove worked. Now everything had to be computerized, as if one couldn't build a house until some consultant in a too-small shirt figured out how to open a laptop. As if that was how they built the Colosseum and the pyramids of Giza. Christ, they'd managed to build the Eiffel Tower in 1889, but nowadays one couldn't come up with the bloody drawings for a one-story house without taking a break for someone to run off and recharge their cell phone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维其实并不认为自己无可救药，他只是希望一切井井有条。他觉得做人不能朝三暮四反复无常，就好像忠诚一文不值。如今换东西那叫一个快，怎么把东西造得坚固一点的知识反而显得多此一举。质量——早就没人在乎了。鲁尼不在乎，其他邻居不在乎，欧维的老板也不在乎。如今一切都是数码的，好像不请个顾问来整明白怎么打开手提电脑的盖子，就没法盖房子。就好像竞技场和吉萨金字塔都得这般才能造出来一样。老天爷，1889年，埃菲尔铁塔就造出来了，而现如今，造个该死的一层楼平房还得时不时停工，好跑开给手机充个电。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Idiot, thought Ove on that day, and also today, all these years after. And every day in between, actually. "How the heck are you supposed to have a reasonable conversation with someone who buys a BMW?" Ove used to ask Sonja when she wondered why the two men could not have a reasonable conversation anymore. And at that point Sonja used to find no other course but to roll her eyes while muttering, "You're hopeless."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“白痴。”那天以及多年以后的这一天，欧维都这么想。还有这两天之间的每一天。“跟一个买宝马的人他妈怎么能聊到一块儿去。”每次索雅问欧维为什么他们两个男人之间再也聊不到一块儿，欧维都会这么回答。然后索雅就只好翻翻白眼嘟囔一句：“你真是无可救药。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">No one could change tires. Install a dimmer switch. Lay some tiles. Plaster a wall. File their own taxes. These were all forms of knowledge that had lost their relevance, and the sorts of things Ove had once spoken of with Rune. And then Rune went and bought a BMW.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没人会换轮胎、装开关、铺瓷砖、粉刷墙壁、倒拖斗车、自己报税。如今这些知识都已经失传了。这就是欧维曾常对鲁尼说的话，然后鲁尼就去买了辆宝马。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Was a person hopeless because he believed there should be some limits? Ove didn't think so.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凡事知道有个度算不算“不可救药”？欧维不这么认为。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This was a world where one became outdated before one's time was up. An entire country standing up and applauding the fact that no one was capable of doing anything properly anymore. The unreserved celebration of mediocrity.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是一个还没过期就已经过时的世界。整个国家都在为没人能正经做事起立鼓掌，毫无保留地为平庸欢呼喝彩。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And yes, he didn't exactly remember how that argument with Rune had started. But it had continued. It had been about radiators and central heating systems and parking slots and trees that had to be felled and snow clearance and lawn mowers and rat poison in Rune's pond. For more than thirty-five years they had paced about on their identical patios behind their identical houses, while throwing meaningful glares over the fence. And then one day about a year ago it all came to an end. Rune became ill. Never came out of the house anymore. Ove didn't even know if he still had the BMW.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="的确，他可能不记得他和鲁尼的纠葛究竟是怎么开始的了，反正就这么愈演愈烈。事关暖气和中央供暖、停车场和该砍倒的树、铲雪和除草，还有鲁尼浴缸里的老鼠药。三十多年来，他们在一模一样的房子背后一模一样的院子里晃悠，然后隔着栅栏远远地眺望。几年前的一天，鲁尼病了，再也没有从房子里出来过。欧维都不知道他是不是还留着那辆宝马。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This society, thinks Ove. Can't they even manufacture rope anymore? He swears profusely while he furiously tries to untangle his legs. How can one fail to manufacture rope, for Christ's sake? How can you get rope wrong?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个社会呀，欧维想。他们连像样的绳子都生产不出来了吗？他一边大声咒骂，一边试着松开纠缠在一起的双腿。生产个绳子能出什么岔子？啊？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So, as they say, the brain functions quicker when it's falling. Like thinking thousands of thoughts in a fraction of a second. In other words, Ove has a good deal of time to think after he's kicked the stool over and fallen and landed on the floor with a lot of angry thrashing. He lies there, on his back, looking up for what seems like half an eternity at the hook still up on the ceiling. Then, in shock, he stares at the rope, which has snapped into two long stumps.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="都说下坠的时候脑子运转得更快。大脑仿佛可以在一瞬间思考成千上万个问题。也就是说，从踢掉脚下的椅子到瞬间下落，最后落得一声巨响加一肚子脾气，在地板上摔作一堆这段时间内，欧维思考了许多问题。之后，他无助地仰面朝天躺在地板上，瞪着顽石般长在天花板上的钩子，它好像已经在那儿长了有半个永恒。他震惊地看到绳子断成两截，绵软地垂下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And there was a part of him that missed that bloody old sod.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他还是有一点怀念那个该死的老浑蛋。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">No, there's no quality anymore, Ove decides. He stands up, brushes himself down, peers around the room and ground floor of his row house. Feels his cheeks burning; he's not quite sure if it's because of anger or shame.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没了，已经没什么质量可言了，欧维下了结论，然后站起身。他拍拍身上的灰，在排屋的底层四下一扫。他感觉到自己的腮帮子火辣辣的，自己也不是很清楚到底是出于愤怒还是羞愧。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Isn't that bloody typical, he thinks. You can't even kill yourself in a sensible way anymore. He picks up the snapped rope and throws it in the kitchen wastebasket. Folds up the plastic sheeting and puts it in the IKEA bags. Puts back the hammer-action drill and the drill bits in their cases, then goes out and puts everything back in the shed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这也太典型了，他想，如今想好好寻个死都做不到。他捡起断了的绳子扔进厨房的垃圾箱，卷起防护膜收进宜家箱里，把冲击钻和钻头都收进盒子，出门把所有东西都放回储藏室。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He stands out there for a few minutes and thinks about how Sonja always used to nag at him to tidy the place up. He always refused, knowing that any new space would immediately be an excuse to go out and buy more useless stuff with which to fill it. And now it's too late for tidying, he confirms. Now there's no longer anyone who wants to go out and buy useless stuff. Now the tidying would just result in a lot of empty gaps. And Ove hates empty gaps.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他在门外站了一会儿，想到索雅曾经总念叨着让他把这儿好好收拾一下，欧维总是拒绝。他很清楚，更多空间只会马上激发出许多添置和购买废物的理由。现在收拾太晚了，他想，已经没人来添置和购买废物了。现在收拾只会腾出无谓的空白来。欧维讨厌空白。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He goes to the workbench, picks up an adjustable wrench and a little plastic watering can. He walks out, locks the shed, and tugs at the door handle three times. Then goes down the little pathway between the houses, turns off by the last mailbox, and rings a doorbell. Anita opens the door. Ove looks at her without a word. Sees Rune sitting there in his wheelchair, vacantly staring out of the window. It seems that's all he's done these last few years.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他走到工作台前，找出一把扳手和一个塑料水壶。出门，锁上储藏室，猛推三下检查门把手。走上排屋间的小路，在最后一个邮箱跟前打弯，按门铃。安妮塔开的门。欧维一言不发地看着她。他瞄见鲁尼坐着轮椅，待在客厅里，目光空洞地瞪着窗外。这似乎是他近几年来唯一做的事。">查看中文翻译</div>
