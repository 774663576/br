<div class="line_en">I was beginning to grow handsome. My coat was fine and soft, and was a shiny black. I had one white foot, and a pretty white star on my forehead. When I was four years old, Mr Gordon came to look at me. He looked closely at my eyes, my mouth, and my legs, and then I had to walk and trot and gallop for him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我开始长得英俊了。我的毛细腻柔软，油黑油黑的，有一只脚是白色的，前额上还有一颗漂亮的白星。在我4岁时，高顿先生来看我。他仔细地看了我的眼睛、嘴巴和腿，然后我为他表演了走步、小跑和奔驰。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Like all horses that have grown up, I had to wear a bit and bridle. A bit is a great piece of cold hard metal, as thick as a man's finger, which is pushed into a horse's mouth between his teeth and over his tongue, with the ends coming out at the corners. It is held there by straps which go over the horse's head, under his neck, round his nose and under his chin. Reins, which the rider holds, are fastened to each end of the bit. Slowly, with my master's kind words and gentle ways, I learned to wear my bit and bridle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="和所有成年的马一样，我得戴上嚼口和笼头。马嚼口是一大片又冷又硬的金属，像人的手指那么厚，塞进马嘴，卡在上下两排牙齿之间，舌头之上，末端从嘴角伸出来。勒住嚼口的绳子绕着马头，经过脖子下面，围着鼻子和下巴颏儿。马夫手里的缰绳紧紧系住嚼口的两端。慢慢地，在我主人的好言好语和温柔的动作引导下，我学会了戴嚼口和笼头。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">To train a horse is to teach him to wear a saddle, and to carry a man, woman or child on his back. The horse must also learn to wear a collar, and to stand still when it is put on; then to have a carriage fixed behind him, and to go fast or slow, whichever his driver wishes. He must never bite or kick or talk to other horses, and must always do what his master tells him, however tired or hungry he feels.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="训练一匹马，要教他学会配戴马鞍，驮男人、女人和小孩。这匹马还得学会戴轭具，在套轭具时，得站稳了不能移动；然后还得学会在身后套上一辆马车，按赶车人的意思快走或慢走。他永远不得踢、咬或者和其他马闲聊，而且不管多累多饿，都必须永远服从主人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">My master liked to train his horses himself before selling them, and the next day my training began.</div>

<div class="line_en">There were more new things to wear. First, a heavy collar on my neck, and a bridle with great side pieces against my eyes, called blinkers. With these on, I could only see in front of me. But in time I got used to everything, and could do my work as well as my mother.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="还有好多新东西要戴。首先，是脖子上重重的轭具，还有笼头，带着一大块挡住我的眼睛的叫作马眼罩的东西。戴上它们，我只能看见我前方的东西。但渐渐地我适应了这一切，而且能把活干得和妈妈一样好了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Next there was the saddle. My master put it on my back very gently, then fixed the straps under my body, speaking quietly to me all the time. Then one morning, he got on my back and rode me round the field on the soft grass. He did this every day until I was used to it. Then he took me to the village where a man fixed metal shoes on to each hoof. My feet felt heavy and strange, but I got used to this, too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="下一步是戴马鞍。主人非常轻柔地把它放到我的背上，把绳子在我的肚皮下系祝他一直轻轻地跟我说着话。然后一天早上，他骑上我在软软的草上绕着田野走了走。他每天都这样，直到我习惯了为止。然后他带我到村里的一个人那儿，给我的每只脚都钉上了掌。我的脚觉得又沉又怪，不过后来我连这个也习惯了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For a fortnight, my master sent me to a neighbour's farm for another kind of training, which was very useful to me. One field was next to the railway and had sheep and cows in it, and I was put in among them. I shall never forget the first train that thundered by, and how I galloped to the far side of the field, trembling with fear at this terrible noise. But after a few days I cared as little as the sheep and cows when a train passed by.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有两周的时间，主人把我送到邻居的农场里进行另一项训练，这对我非常有用。这是一片靠近铁路的田野，有羊，有牛，我被放到他们中间。我永远忘不了当第一辆火车轰鸣而过的时候，我是如何害怕得浑身颤抖，如何飞也似地逃得远远的。不过几天以后，再有火车过时，我已和那些牛羊一样若无其事了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr Gordon's house, which was called the Hall, stood in Birtwick Park, near the village. We went into the Park through a large gate, then trotted along a smooth road between some trees to the house and gardens. Beyond this were the stables.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="高顿先生的房子叫作大宅，就在村子附近的伯特威克庄园。我们穿过一个大门走进去，小跑着经过一条平坦的通向房子和花园的林间路，尽头是一排马厩。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was room for many horses and carriages. My stable had four good stalls and a large window. It was very pleasant. The first stall was called a loose box, where a horse is not tied up all the time but is free to move around as he likes. It is a great thing to have a loose box. The groom put me into it and gave me some oats. Then he patted me, spoke kindly, and went away. In the stall next to mine stood a little fat grey pony.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这里很大，能容得下很多马匹和马车。我的马厩分成挺像样的4个栏，还有一扇大窗。真体面。第一栏叫作“放饲马房”，在这儿马不拴着，想怎么走动都可以。有这么一个自由的空间真是太好了。马夫牵我进屋，喂了我一些燕麦。然后他拍拍我，温和地说了几句就走了。在我隔壁是一匹胖乎乎的小灰马。">查看中文翻译</div>
