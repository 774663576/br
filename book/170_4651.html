<div class="line_en">Galazza Galare arrived at the Great Pyramid attended by a dozen White Graces, girls of noble birth who were still too young to have served their year in the temple's pleasure gardens. They made for a pretty portrait, the proud old woman all in green surrounded by the little girls robed and veiled in white, armored in their innocence.</div>

Two of Dany's favorite hostages served the food and kept the cups filled -- a doe-eyed little girl called Qezza and a skinny boy named Grazhar. They were brother and sister, and cousins of the Green Grace, who greeted them with kisses when she swept in, and asked them if they had been good.</div>

<div class="line_en">"They are of my blood," the Green Grace said, as Qezza filled her cup with a dark red wine. "It is good to know they have pleased Your Radiance. I hope I may do likewise." The old woman's hair was white and her skin was parchment thin, but the years had not dimmed her eyes. They were as green as her robes; sad eyes, full of wisdom. "If you will forgive my saying so, Your Radiance looks… weary. Are you sleeping?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他们是我的血脉”，绿人仁者说，Qezza往她的杯中倒满了深红色的酒，知道他们能取悦光之主我很高兴，我希望我也能如此。”老妇人的头发全白了，皮肤如同羊皮纸一般，但是岁月没能暗淡她的双眼。它们如她的袍子一样碧绿，悲伤的双眼中充满智慧。“请原谅我这么说，光之主看起来…很累。你睡觉了吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was all Dany could do not to laugh. "Not well. Last night three Qartheen galleys sailed up the Skahazadhan under the cover of darkness. The Mother's Men loosed flights of fire arrows at their sails and flung pots of burning pitch onto their decks, but the galleys slipped by quickly and suffered no lasting harm. The Qartheen mean to close the river to us, as they have closed the bay. And they are no longer alone. Three galleys from New Ghis have joined them, and a carrack out of Tolos." The Tolosi had replied to her request for an alliance by proclaiming her a whore and demanding that she return Meereen to its Great Masters. Even that was preferable to the answer of Mantarys, which came by way of caravan in a cedar chest. Inside she had found the heads of her three envoys, pickled. "Perhaps your gods can help us. Ask them to send a gale and sweep the galleys from the bay."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="丹妮只能苦笑，“睡的不好。昨天夜里三艘奎尔斯的平底战船在夜色的掩护下逆流而上到了SKAHAZADHAN。龙母之子的战士向他们的船帆射出火箭雨，向他们的甲板上投掷燃烧的沥青。可是那些战舰快速的逃脱了，没受到什么损伤。奎尔斯人意图封锁河流，如同他们封锁海湾那样。而且他们不再孤单，三艘从新吉斯来的战舰加入了他们，还有一艘脱罗斯武装商船。”脱罗斯回复她结盟的请求的方式是宣称她是妓女，并且要求她把弥林归还给它的伟主大人们（咱能不用这坑爹的名字么）。然而比起玛塔里斯的回答这还算好的，玛塔里斯人派来了一辆装着雪松盒子的拖车。她在盒子里发现了她的三位使节腌渍过的头颅。“也许你的神能帮助我们。请他们降下一阵大风拂去海湾里的那些战舰。”">查看中文翻译</div>

They had fought about the hostages half a dozen times. "The Sons of the Harpy are laughing in their pyramids," Skahaz said, just this morning. "What good are hostages if you will not take their heads?" In his eyes, she was only a weak woman. Hazzea was enough. What good is peace if it must be purchased with the blood of little children?
