<div class="line_en">I wasn't looking forward to Friday, and it more than lived up to my non-expectations. Of course there were the fainting comments. Jessica especially seemed to get a kick out of that story. Luckily Mike had kept his mouth shut, and no one seemed to know about Edward's involvement. She did have a lot of questions about lunch, though.</div>

<div class="line_en">The worst part about Friday was that, even though I knew he wasn't going to be there, I still hoped. When I walked into the cafeteria with Jessica and Mike, I couldn't keep from looking at his table, where Rosalie, Alice, and Jasper sat talking, heads close together.

<div class="line_en">That night at dinner, Charlie seemed enthusiastic about my trip to La Push in the morning. I think he felt guilty for leaving me home alone on the weekends, but he'd spent too many years building his habits to break them now. Of course he knew the names of all the kids going, and their parents, and their great-grandparents, too, probably. He seemed to approve. I wondered if he would approve of my plan to ride to Seattle with Edward Cullen. Not that I was going to tell him.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Newtons' Olympic Outfitters store was just north of town. I'd seen the store, but I'd never stopped there -- not having much need for any supplies required for being outdoors over an extended period of time. In the parking lot I recognized Mike's Suburban and Tyler's Sentra. As I pulled up next to their vehicles, I could see the group standing around in front of the Suburban. Eric was there, along with two other boys I had class with; I was fairly sure their names were Ben and Conner. Jess was there, flanked by Angela and Lauren. Three other girls stood with them, including one I remembered falling over in Gym on Friday. That one gave me a dirty look as I got out of the truck, and whispered something to Lauren. Lauren shook out her cornsilk hair and eyed me scornfully.</div>

<div class="line_en">The numbers worked out in my favor, though. Lee brought two extra people, and suddenly every seat was necessary.

<div class="line_en">I'd been to the beaches around La Push many times during my Forks summers with Charlie, so the mile-long crescent of First Beach was familiar to me. It was still breathtaking. The water was dark gray, even in the sunlight, white-capped and heaving to the gray, rocky shore. Islands rose out of the steel harbor waters with sheer cliff sides, reaching to uneven summits, and crowned with austere, soaring firs. The beach had only a thin border of actual sand at the water's edge, after which it grew into millions of large, smooth stones that looked uniformly gray from a distance, but close up were every shade a stone could be: terra-cotta, sea green, lavender, blue gray, dull gold. The tide line was strewn with huge driftwood trees, bleached bone white in the salt waves, some piled together against the edge of the forest fringe, some lying solitary, just out of reach of the waves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当我还在福克斯过暑假的时候，我和查理一起去过很多次拉普什周围的海滩。所以那片一英里长的新月形的第一湾对我来说毫不陌生。那里依然美极了。即使是在阳光下，海水依然是暗灰色的，覆盖着雪白的泡沫，击打着灰色的布满岩礁的海岸。岛屿耸立在港湾里钢铸般平静的海面上，四面都是悬崖绝壁，怪石嶙峋，顶上长满了险峻高大的杉树。沙滩上只有沿着海边的窄窄一片是货真价实的沙子，沙地后逐渐过渡为成千上万的巨大的平滑的礁石。远远看过去，所有的礁石都是一模一样的灰色。只有当走近的时候你才会发现，每块石头下面的荫凉处都是不同的颜色：棕橙色，海绿色，淡紫色，蓝灰色，暗金色。海岸线上点缀着巨大的浮木，它们被海水漂成了骨白色，有些堆叠在森林的边缘，有些孤零零的躺在海滩上，刚好处在海浪拍打不到的地方。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a brisk wind coming off the waves, cool and briny. Pelicans floated on the swells while seagulls and a lone eagle wheeled above them. The clouds still circled the sky, threatening to invade at any moment, but for now the sun shone bravely in its halo of blue sky.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Have you ever seen a driftwood fire?" Mike asked me. I was sitting on one of the bone-colored benches; the other girls clustered, gossiping excitedly, on either side of me. Mike kneeled by the fire, lighting one of the smaller sticks with a cigarette lighter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你见过浮木篝火吗？”迈克问我。我坐在其中一张骨白色的长凳上，别的女孩都聚在一起，兴奋地说着闲话，坐在了我的另一边。迈克跪在篝火旁，正在用打火机点燃其中一根比较细的干枝。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We picked our way down to the beach, Mike leading the way to a ring of driftwood logs that had obviously been used for parties like ours before. There was a fire circle already in place, filled with black ashes. Eric and the boy I thought was named Ben gathered broken branches of driftwood from the drier piles against the forest edge, and soon had a teepee-shaped construction built atop the old cinders.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们循路走下沙滩，迈克在前头领路，把我们带向一圈圆浮木。显然，这圈浮木之前也曾为像我们这样的成群结队的旅人服务过。那里有个摆得恰到好处的篝火堆，上面铺满了黑色的灰烬。埃里克和另一个男孩——我想他的名字是本——从树林边缘干燥的木头堆里收集了不少破碎的浮木块，然后很快在那些经年累月的灰烬上垒起了一个摇摇晃晃的木架。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The salt does it. Pretty, isn't it?" He lit one more piece, placed it where the fire hadn't yet caught, and then came to sit by me. Thankfully, Jess was on his other side.

<div class="line_cn" title="“因为有盐。很漂亮，对吧？”他又点燃了一片木屑，放到木架上火还没烧到的地方，然后过来坐到我旁边。谢天谢地，杰西坐在他的另一边。她转向他，努力吸引他的注意力。我看着那堆古怪的蓝绿色火焰冲着天空劈啪作响。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The hike wasn't too long, though I hated to lose the sky in the woods. The green light of the forest was strangely at odds with the adolescent laughter, too murky and ominous to be in harmony with the light banter around me. I had to watch each step I took very carefully, avoiding roots below and branches above, and I soon fell behind. Eventually I broke through the emerald confines of the forest and found the rocky shore again. It was low tide, and a tidal river flowed past us on its way to the sea. Along its pebbled banks, shallow pools that never completely drained were teeming with life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这次远足不算太漫长，虽然我一向讨厌待在林子里，因为看不到天空。森林里的绿光和少年人的笑声有一种古怪的不协调感，这里太阴森了，有一种不祥的气氛，跟我周围的轻松的调笑一点儿也不搭调。我不得不留神看着自己踏下的每一步，提防着底下的树根和顶上的树枝，很快被落在了后头。最终，我冲出了森林里翡翠色的藩篱，重新看见了布满岩礁的海岸。正是落潮时分，一条潮汐河涌动着从我们面前流过，奔向大海。沿着布满砾石的海岸上，一湾湾浅浅的水池从未干涸过，总是盈满了生机。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Lauren was the one who made my decision for me. She didn't want to hike, and she was definitely wearing the wrong shoes for it. Most of the other girls besides Angela and Jessica decided to stay on the beach as well. I waited until Tyler and Eric had committed to remaining with them before I got up quietly to join the pro-hiking group. Mike gave me a huge smile when he saw that I was coming.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="是劳伦促使我最终作出了决定。她不想去远足，而且她显然穿着不适合徒步旅行的鞋子。除了安吉拉和杰西卡，大部分女孩都决定也留在沙滩上。我一直等到泰勒和埃里克被委托留下来陪她们以后，才默默地加入了去远足的那一组。当迈克看到我加入的时候，他给了我一个大大的笑脸。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After a half hour of chatter, some of the boys wanted to hike to the nearby tidal pools. It was a dilemma. On the one hand, I loved the tide pools. They had fascinated me since I was a child; they were one of the only things I ever looked forward to when I had to come to Forks. On the other hand, I'd also fallen into them a lot. Not a big deal when you're seven and with your dad. It reminded me of Edward's request -- that I not fall into the ocean.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们漫无边际地闲聊了半个小时后，有几个男孩想到潮汐池周围走走。这实在让人进退两难。一方面，我喜欢潮汐池。当我还是个孩子的时候，就开始对它们着迷了。从前当我到福克斯来的时候，它们是我唯一盼望着的事物。另一方面，我也常常掉进潮汐池里。当你只有七岁，和爸爸在一起的时候，这没什么大不了的。但这让我想起了爱德华的请求——别让我自己掉进海里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I was very cautious not to lean too far over the little ocean ponds. The others were fearless, leaping over the rocks, perching precariously on the edges. I found a very stable-looking rock on the fringe of one of the largest pools and sat there cautiously, spellbound by the natural aquarium below me. The bouquets of brilliant anemones undulated ceaselessly in the invisible current, twisted shells scurried about the edges, obscuring the crabs within them, starfish stuck motionless to the rocks and each other, while one small black eel with white racing stripes wove through the bright green weeds, waiting for the sea to return.

<div class="line_en">It was relaxing to sit with Angela; she was a restful kind of person to be around -- she didn't feel the need to fill every silence with chatter. She left me free to think undisturbed while we ate. And I was thinking about how disjointedly time seemed to flow in Forks, passing in a blur at times, with single images standing out more clearly than others. And then, at other times, every second was significant, etched in my mind. I knew exactly what caused the difference, and it disturbed me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="和安吉拉坐在一起是一件让人放松的事，她是那种能给周围的人休息的人——她不认为需要用闲聊来填满每一段沉默。当我们吃东西的时候，她让我不受干扰地自由地思索着。我在想着，在福克斯度过的时光是那么的支离破碎，有时候时间过得飞快，模糊了记忆中的一切，只有几幅简单的画面凸显出来，比别的画面显得更清晰些。然而，别的一些时候，每一秒都显得那么的重要，深深地烙在了我的心上。我清楚地知道是什么导致了不同，但这更让我感到困扰。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The food was already being passed around, and the boys hurried to claim a share while Eric introduced us as we each entered the driftwood circle. Angela and I were the last to arrive, and, as Eric said our names, I noticed a younger boy sitting on the stones near the fire glance up at me in interest. I sat down next to Angela, and Mike brought us sandwiches and an array of sodas to choose from, while a boy who looked to be the oldest of the visitors rattled off the names of the seven others with him. All I caught was that one of the girls was also named Jessica, and the boy who noticed me was named Jacob.</div>

<div class="line_en">A few minutes after Angela left with the hikers, Jacob sauntered over to take her place by my side. He looked fourteen, maybe fifteen, and had long, glossy black hair pulled back with a rubber band at the nape of his neck. His skin was beautiful, silky and russet-colored; his eyes were dark, set deep above the high planes of his cheekbones. He still had just a hint of childish roundness left around his chin. Altogether, a very pretty face. However, my positive opinion of his looks was damaged by the first words out of his mouth.</div>

<div class="line_en">During lunch the clouds started to advance, slinking across the blue sky, darting in front of the sun momentarily, casting long shadows across the beach, and blackening the waves. As they finished eating, people started to drift away in twos and threes. Some walked down to the edge of the waves, trying to skip rocks across the choppy surface. Others were gathering a second expedition to the tide pools. Mike -- with Jessica shadowing him -- headed up to the one shop in the village. Some of the local kids went with them; others went along on the hike. By the time they all had scattered, I was sitting alone on my driftwood log, with Lauren and Tyler occupying themselves by the CD player someone had thought to bring, and three teenagers from the reservation perched around the circle, including the boy named Jacob and the oldest boy who had acted as spokesperson.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在我们吃午饭的时候，云层开始向前推移，偷偷地蚕食着蓝天，随时都有可能冲到太阳跟前，在海滩上留下长长的阴影，让海浪变得一片漆黑。他们吃完东西以后，开始三三两两地散开。有些走下海滩走到海浪的边缘，试着跃过波涛起伏的海面跳到岩礁上。另一些人聚拢在一起，准备再来一次潮汐池远征。迈克——杰西卡像影子一样跟着他——起身向村里的一个商店走去。几个本地的孩子跟他们一起去。别的孩子则加入到远足中去。等到他们都七零八落地走光了的时候，我独自坐在我的那根圆浮木，劳伦和泰勒占据了那个不知是谁想着带来的随身听。三个来自保留区的青少年围着篝火坐着，包括那个名叫雅克布的男孩，还有那个最年长的表现得像个发言人一样的男孩。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“然后是关于冷族的故事。”他的声音压得更低了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The cold ones?" I asked, not faking my intrigue now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“冷族？”我问道，不再掩饰自己的阴谋了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Your great-grandfather?" I encouraged.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你的曾祖父？”我鼓励着他说下去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yes. There are stories of the cold ones as old as the wolf legends, and some much more recent. According to legend, my own great-grandfather knew some of them. He was the one who made the treaty that kept them off our land." He rolled his eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的。关于冷族的故事和狼的传说一样古老，有些则更近些。根据传说的内容，我的曾祖父曾经认识他们中的一些人。他和他们订下了条约，让他们远离我们的土地。”他转了转眼睛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Werewolves have enemies?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“狼人会有敌人吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He was a tribal elder, like my father. You see, the cold ones are the natural enemies of the wolf-well, not the wolf, really, but the wolves that turn into men, like our ancestors. You would call them werewolves."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“他是部落的长老，和我爸爸一样。你知道，冷族和狼是天生的死敌——嗯，好吧，不是普通的狼，而是那些可以化成人形的狼，比方说我们的祖先。你可以称他们为狼人。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"So you see," Jacob continued, "the cold ones are traditionally our enemies. But this pack that came to our territory during my great-grandfather's time was different. They didn't hunt the way others of their kind did -- they weren't supposed to be dangerous to the tribe. So my great-grandfather made a truce with them. If they would promise to stay off our lands, we wouldn't expose them to the pale-faces." He winked at me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“所以，你看，”雅克布继续说道。“冷族向来是我们的敌人。但在我曾祖父的时候，我们的领地里来了一群不太一样的冷族。他们不像别的冷族一样狩猎——他们也不会威胁到我们的部族。所以我的曾祖父和他们签下了休战协定。只要他们保证离我们的领土远远的，我们就不拆穿他们苍白的真面目。”他向我眨着眼睛。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"There's always a risk for humans to be around the cold ones, even if they're civilized like this clan was. You never know when they might get too hungry to resist." He deliberately worked a thick edge of menace into his tone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“人类和冷族靠得太近总是有风险的，即使他们像这个小团体一样已经文明开化了。你永远不能知道他们什么时候会忍耐不住饥饿。”他故意让自己的口吻里带上了浓浓的恐吓的味道。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I pulled up my hood as we tramped across the rocks toward the parking lot. A few drops were beginning to fall, making black spots on the stones where they landed. When we got to the Suburban the others were already loading everything back in. I crawled into the backseat by Angela and Tyler, announcing that I'd already had my turn in the shotgun position. Angela just stared out the window at the escalating storm, and Lauren twisted around in the middle seat to occupy Tyler's attention, so I could simply lay my head back on the seat and close my eyes and try very hard not to think.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当我们踩着碎石向停车场走去的时候，我拉上了兜帽。几滴雨水开始落下来，打在石块上，染出了一个个小黑点。我们走到巨无霸那里的时候，别的人已经把所有的东西都放上车了。我宣称自己已经坐过副驾驶座了，这次便爬进后座，跟安吉拉和泰勒坐在一块儿。安吉拉只是盯着窗外，看着越下越大的暴雨。劳伦从中座扭过头来，占据着泰勒的注意力。所以我可以单纯地把头靠在座位上，闭上双眼，努力不再去想任何东西。">查看中文翻译</div>
