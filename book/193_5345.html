<div class="line_en">Robert Langdon had no idea where he was or how long he had been unconscious when he opened his eyes and found himself staring up at the underside of a baroque, frescoed cupola.

<div class="line_en">Langdon suddenly realized that all of the catalysts that had been driving him -- helping to save Vatican City, rescuing the four cardinals, coming face to face with the brotherhood he had studied for years -- all of these things had evaporated from his mind. The war was lost. A new compulsion had ignited within him. It was simple. Stark. Primal.</div>

<div class="line_en">He felt an unexpected emptiness inside. Langdon had often heard that intense situations could unite two people in ways that decades together often did not. He now believed it.

<div class="line_en">He looked at his watch. Thirty minutes. Langdon moved past the firemen toward Bernini'sEcstasy of St. Teresa. This time, as he stared at Bernini's marker, Langdon had no doubt what he was looking for.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他看看表。三十分钟。兰登穿过那群消防员，朝贝尼尼的《圣女大德兰的狂喜》走去。这回，当兰登注视著贝尼尼的指标时，心中很清楚自己在寻找什麽了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Directly over the recumbent saint, against a backdrop of gilded flame, hovered Bernini's angel. The angel's hand clutched a pointed spear of fire. Langdon's eyes followed the direction of the shaft, arching toward the right side of the church. His eyes hit the wall. He scanned the spot where the spear was pointing. There was nothing there. Langdon knew, of course, the spear was pointing far beyond the wall, into the night, somewhere across Rome.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="贝尼尼的天使飞翔在空中，就在躺著的圣女上方，背对著贴了金箔的火焰。天使的手抓著一根燃著火焰的尖矛。兰登的双眼循著那根矛的方向，弯向教堂的右侧，然后视线碰到了墙壁。他扫视著矛所指的那个点，那裡什麽都没有。当然，兰登知道，矛所指的地方远在墙壁之外，就在罗马城另一处的夜色中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="小组长派了个人到消防车上拿张地图。兰登转回那座雕像。土……气……火……薇多利雅。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Langdon looked at the angel's spear again to get his bearings. The chief had estimated correctly. According to the map, the spear was pointing west. Langdon traced a line from his current location west across the map. Almost instantly his hopes began to sink. It seemed that with every inch his finger traveled, he passed yet another building marked by a tiny black cross. Churches. The city was riddled with them. Finally, Langdon's finger ran out of churches and trailed off into the suburbs of Rome. He exhaled and stepped back from the map. Damn.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登又去看看那个天使的矛，好确定方向。刚刚那位小组长的判断没错。根据这张地图，天使的矛是指向西边。兰登在地图上从他目前的位置循直线往西，满腹的希望几乎立刻往下沉。他的手指往前移得愈远，似乎就经过愈多以小小的黑色十字所标示的建筑物：教堂。这个城市到处都是教堂。最后，兰登的手指来到了罗马郊区，再也不会碰到教堂了。他吐出一口气，后退了一步。该死。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Langdon flashed on Bernini's statue ofTriton -- the Greek God of the sea. Then he realized it was located in the square outside this very church, in entirely the wrong direction. He forced himself to think. What figure would Bernini have carved as a glorification of water? Neptune and Apollo? Unfortunately that statue was in London's Victoria &amp; Albert Museum.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登想到了贝尼尼那个希腊人鱼海神特里同的雕像，然后又想到这座雕像就位于这个教堂外面的广场，方向完全不对。他逼著自己再想。贝尼尼曾雕过什麽颂扬水的形象？《尼普顿与阿波罗》？（译注：尼普顿〔Neptune〕为古罗马神话中的海神。）不幸的是，那座雕像位于伦敦的维多利亚暨阿柏特博物馆。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Surveying the whole of Rome, Langdon's eyes touched down on the three churches where the first three cardinals had been killed. The Chigi Chapel… St. Peter's… here…</div>

<div class="line_en">So where the hell is Water? Langdon knew that anywhere he placed the fourth point, the triangle would be destroyed. The only option to retain the symmetry was to place the fourth marker inside the triangle, at the center. He looked at the spot on the map. Nothing. The idea bothered him anyway. The four elements of science were consideredequal. Water was not special; Water would not be at thecenter of the others.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以水到底在哪裡？兰登知道不管他把第四点标在哪裡，都会破坏这个三角形。保持其对称性的唯一选择，就是就是把第四点标在三角形内，位于中央。他看著地图上的那个点，什麽都没有，但他无论如何甩不掉这个想法。第四个科学元素被认为有平等的含义。水并不特别；应该不会位于其他三点的中央。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Seeing them all laid out before him now, Langdon noted an oddity in their locations. Somehow he had imagined the churches would be scattered randomly across Rome. But they most definitely were not. Improbably, the three churches seemed to be separated systematically, in an enormous city-wide triangle. Langdon double-checked. He was not imagining things."Penna," he said suddenly, without looking up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="望著三座教堂就分佈在面前的地图上，兰登注意到三者的位置有种奇特性。不知怎地，他曾想像这些教堂会是随意散落在罗马各处，但结果完全不是如此。那三座教堂竟似乎对称分佈，形成一个跨越全城的巨大三角形，简直是不太可能。兰登又检查了一遍，完全想像不到。「笔。」他忽然说，连头也没抬。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Langdon's first thought was for the Great Seal on the one-dollar bill -- the triangle containing the all-seeing eye. But it didn't make sense. He had marked onlythree points. There were supposed to be four in all.</div>

<div class="line_en">As he studied the other possible points around the triangle, something unexpected happened. He noticed that the line he had drawn earlier to indicate the direction of the angel's spear passed perfectly through one of the possibilities. Stupefied, Langdon circled that point. He was now looking at four ink marks on the map, arranged in somewhat of an awkward, kitelike diamond.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正当他研究著那个三角形，想看看第四个点可以放在哪裡时，一件意想不到的事情发生了。他发现稍早他循著天使之矛所指方向而画的那条轨迹，刚好完全符合另一个可能性。兰登惊愕地圈起那个点。他现在看著地图上四个用笔画出来的标记，构成了一个笨拙的、像风筝的菱形（diamond），（译注：亦可指钻石）。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He frowned. Diamonds were not an Illuminati symbol either. He paused. Then again…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他皱起眉头。菱形也不是光明会的象徵符号。他顿了一下。不过话说回来……">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Langdon looked at the map. A square, perhaps? Although a square made no symbolic sense, squares were symmetrical at least. Langdon put his finger on the map at one of the points that would turn the triangle into a square. He saw immediately that a perfect square was impossible. The angles of the original triangle were oblique and created more of a distorted quadrilateral.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登看著那张地图。或许是个正方形？虽然正方形不符合象徵符号上的意义，但至少是对称的。兰登把一根手指放在地图上的一点，试著让那个三角形变成正方形，但立刻发现不可能。原来的三角形中，三个角都不是直角，加上第四点就会比较像一个歪的四边形。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Still, his instinct told him the systematic arrangement could not possibly be accidental. I'm not yet seeing the whole picture. There was only one alternative. The four points did not make a triangle; they made some other shape.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，直觉告诉他，这个对称的安排不可能是巧合而已。我还没看到整个图像。刚刚只是其中一个可能而已。四个点不会是组成一个三角形；应该是其他形状才对。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For an instant Langdon flashed on the famed Illuminati Diamond. The thought, of course, was ridiculous. He dismissed it. Besides, this diamond was oblong -- like a kite -- hardly an example of the flawless symmetry for which the Illuminati Diamond was revered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登立刻就想到了著名的光明会钻石。当然，这个想法很荒谬，他立刻抛开。此外，地图上这个菱形长长的──像个风筝──实在不像对称完美、令人肃然起敬的光明会钻石。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When he leaned in to examine where he had placed the final mark, Langdon was surprised to find that the fourth point lay dead center of Rome's famed Piazza Navona. He knew the piazza contained a major church, but he had already traced his finger through that piazza and considered the church there. To the best of his knowledge it contained no Bernini works. The church was called Saint Agnes in Agony, named for St. Agnes, a ravishing teenage virgin banished to a life of sexual slavery for refusing to renounce her faith.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登凑近地图，研究他刚刚圈起的那个地方，很惊讶地发现第四个点就位于罗马著名的拿佛纳广场正中央。他知道那个广场边有个大型教堂，但他刚刚手指已经画过那个广场，考虑过那座教堂。就他所知，教堂裡没有贝尼尼的作品。那个教堂叫做「竞赛场圣雅妮教堂」，是为了纪念一名迷人的十来岁贞女圣雅妮，她因为拒绝放弃信仰，被赶入妓院去当终身性奴隶。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There must be something in that church! Langdon racked his brain, picturing the inside of the church. He could think of no Bernini works at all inside, much less anything to do withwater. The arrangement on the map was bothering him too. A diamond. It was far too accurate to be coincidence, but it was not accurate enough to make any sense. A kite? Langdon wondered if he had chosen the wrong point. What am I missing!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那座教堂裡一定有些什麽！兰登绞尽脑汁，想像著教堂内部。他想不出裡面有任何贝尼尼的作品，更别说是跟水有关的了。地图上的位置分佈也让他觉得困扰。菱形。这简直是太巧了，但还没巧到合理的地步。风筝？兰登不晓得自己是不是选错了点。我到底漏了什麽！">查看中文翻译</div>

The four elements of science unfolded before his eyes… sprawled across Rome in an enormous, city-wide cross.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他现在正看著的形状，原来根本就不是要构成菱形。这四个点会变出菱形来，是因为兰登把相邻的点连接起来。光明会相信的是对立之物！兰登用笔将彼此相对的点连起来，手指颤抖著。他眼前的地图上，是个巨大的十字形。是个十字架！科学的四个元素在他眼前展开……绵延穿越罗马城，形成一个巨大的、跨及全城的十字架。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was cunning wordplay. Langdon had originally read the word'Cross as an abbreviation ofAcross. He assumed it was poetic license intended to retain the meter of the poem. But it was so much more than that! Another hidden clue.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是个狡猾的文字游戏。兰登原先把Ｃross这个字当作Across的缩写，以为那是为了保持格律的随兴写法。但结果远非如此而已，而是另一个隐藏的机关。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Kneeling beside Olivetti, out of sight behind some pews, Langdon discreetly took possession of the commander's semiautomatic and walkie-talkie. Langdon knew he would call for help, but this was not the place to do it. The final altar of science needed to remain a secret for now. The media and fire department racing with sirens blaring to Piazza Navona would be no help at all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他在欧里维提身旁跪下来，几排教堂长椅替他遮挡了视线，兰登不动声色地取走指挥官的半自动手枪和无线电对讲机。兰登知道自己得打电话求援，但眼前不是适合的地方，最后一个科学祭坛目前必须保密。媒体和开著警笛赶来拿佛纳广场的消防队是一点忙都帮不上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Without a word, Langdon slipped out the door and skirted the press, who were now entering the church in droves. He crossed Piazza Barberini. In the shadows he turned on the walkie-talkie. He tried to hail Vatican City but heard nothing but static. He was either out of range or the transmitter needed some kind of authorization code. Langdon adjusted the complex dials and buttons to no avail. Abruptly, he realized his plan to get help was not going to work. He spun, looking for a pay phone. None. Vatican circuits were jammed anyway.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="半句话都没说，兰登悄悄溜出了门，避开一群群挤入教堂的媒体。他穿过巴贝里尼广场，在阴影中打开了对讲机。但不是因为脱离通话范围，就是因为需要某种授权码才能传输讯号。兰登调整了那些复杂的号码键和按钮，却毫无帮助。忽然间，他明白自己求助的计画行不通了。他转身想找公共电话，没找到。反正梵蒂冈的电话这会儿也塞爆了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Langdon glanced back at the church. Smoke spiraled over the cupola, lit by the media lights and fire trucks. He wondered if he should go back and get help. Instinct warned him however that extra help, especially untrained help, would be nothing but a liability. If the Hassassin sees us coming… He thought of Vittoria and knew this would be his final chance to face her captor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登回头看了一眼教堂。小圆顶上烟雾盘旋而去，被媒体和消防车的灯光照亮。他不知道是否该回去求援。但直觉警告他，多馀的帮助，尤其是出自未受训练的人员，只会碍手碍脚。如果那个哈撒辛看到我们来了……他想到薇多利雅，知道自己若想见到那个绑匪，眼前就是最后的机会了。">查看中文翻译</div>

Even the taxi drivers, it seemed, had dropped everything to find a television. Piazza Navona was only about a mile away, but Langdon had no intention of wasting precious energy on foot. He glanced back at the church, wondering if he could borrow a vehicle from someone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拿佛纳广场，他心想，知道自己有很多时间赶到那裡，佔好位置在旁监视。他扫视著广场想找计程车，但街上几乎空无一人。看起来好像连计程车司机都丢下一切去看电视了。拿佛纳广场离这裡只有一哩，但兰登不打算浪费宝贵的体力走路去。他回头看了一眼教堂，好奇著自己能不能借辆车开过去。">查看中文翻译</div>

Pulling the gun from his pocket, he committed an act so out of character that he suspected his soul must now be possessed.
