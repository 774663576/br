<div class="line_en">"We're going!" says Peeta, shoving the Peacekeeper who's pressing on me. "We get it, all right? Come on, Katniss." His arm encircles me and guides me back into the Justice Building. The Peacekeepers follow a pace or two behind us. The moment we're inside, the doors slam shut and we hear the Peacekeepers' boots moving back toward the crowd.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Both of you. With me," says Haymitch. Peeta and I follow him, leaving the others behind. The Peacekeepers who are stationed around the Justice Building take little interest in our movements now that we are safely inside. We ascend a magnificent curved marble staircase. At the top, there's a long hall with worn carpet on the floor. Double doors stand open, welcoming us into the first room we encounter. The ceiling must be twenty feet high. Designs of fruit and flowers are carved into the molding and small, fat children with wings look down at us from every angle. Vases of blossoms give off a cloying scent that makes my eyes itch. Our evening clothes hang on racks against the wall. This room has been prepared for our use, but we're barely there long enough to drop off our gifts. Then Haymitch yanks the microphones from our chests, stuffs them beneath a couch cushion, and waves us on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你们俩，跟我来。”黑密斯说。皮塔和我跟在他后面，把其他人留在原地。我们目前处于安全位置，治安警对我们的活动也没十分留意。我们沿着一个很华丽的大理石旋转楼梯向上走。走到顶层后，前面出现一个长长的厅廊，地上铺着破旧的地毯。两扇大门洞开，对我们的到来没有丝毫的拒绝，天花板足有二十英尺高，装饰着水果和鲜花浮雕，屋角长翅膀的胖胖的小孩在凝视着我们。花瓶里的鲜花发出浓烈的香气，熏得我睁不开眼。我们的衣服挂在墙壁的衣钩上，原来这个房间是为我们准备的，可我们在此只停留了片刻，连留下礼物的时间都没有。黑密斯把麦克风从我们的衣服上拽下来，把它们塞在沙发靠垫下面，然后挥手让我们继续向前走。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As far as I know, Haymitch has only been here once, when he was on his Victory Tour decades ago. But he must have a remarkable memory or reliable instincts, because he leads us up through a maze of twisting staircases and increasingly narrow halls. At times he has to stop and force a door. By the protesting squeak of the hinges you can tell it's been a long time since it was opened. Eventually we climb a ladder to a trapdoor. When Haymitch pushes it aside, we find ourselves in the dome of the Justice Building. It's a huge place filled with broken furniture, piles of books and ledgers, and rusty weapons. The coat of dust blanketing everything is so thick it's clear it hasn't been disturbed for years. Light struggles to filter in through four grimy square windows set in the sides of the dome. Haymitch kicks the trapdoor shut and turns on us.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就我所知道的，黑密斯只在十年前胜利巡演时来过这一次。他肯定具有超强的记忆力和敏感的直觉，才能领我们穿过了一个又一个迷宫般旋转的楼梯，穿过一个又一个大厅，大厅越来越窄。有时，他需要停下来，把门撬开。沉重的大门在打开时发出吱吱嘎嘎的声音，看得出这扇门已经很久没有打开过了。最后我们爬上一节梯子，来到一扇隔板门前。黑密斯把门打开，我们就已经来到法院大楼的圆顶内。圆顶很大，堆满破家具、旧书、脚手架横木和生锈的武器，所有的物品上面都蒙着一层厚厚的灰尘，看来已经很久没有人来过了。光线透过圆顶内肮脏的四个窗户费力地射进来，使圆顶内有了一丝昏暗的光亮。黑密斯一脚把隔板门踢上，转身看着我们。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"What happened?" he asks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“发生了什么事？”他问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Peeta relates all that occurred in the square. The whistle, the salute, our hesitation on the verandah, the murder of the old man. "What's going on, Haymitch?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮塔把广场上发生的事叙述了一遍，人们怎么吹哨、怎么向我表示敬意、我们在前厅如何犹豫、枪杀老人。“事情会怎么样，黑密斯？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I don't agree. I think it will be a hundred times worse coming from me. But I tell Peeta everything as calmly as I can. About President Snow, the unrest in the districts. I don't even omit the kiss with Gale. I lay out how we are all in jeopardy, how the whole country is in jeopardy because of my trick with the berries. "I was supposed to fix things on this tour. Make everyone who had doubted believe I acted out of love. Calm things down. But obviously, all I've done today is get three people killed, and now everyone in the square will be punished." I feel so sick that I have to sit down on a couch, despite the exposed springs and stuffing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我可不这么想，要是我引起的，事情要糟一百倍。我把一切以尽量平静的语气告诉了皮塔，有关斯诺总统的事、有关各区不稳定的局势、甚至和盖尔接吻的事都没有落下。我坦白地告诉他我们都处境危险，整个国家都因我的浆果计策而处于危险之中。“他们希望我在这次巡演中把事情平息了，让每个人曾经有过怀疑的人坚信我这么做纯粹是因为爱。让一切平静下来。可是，明摆着，我今天所做的一切让三个人丧命，现在，广场上的每一个人都要遭受惩罚。”我心里难过极了，一屁股坐在旁边的一张弹簧和棉垫都跑出来的破沙发上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Then I made things worse, too. By giving the money," says Peeta. Suddenly he strikes out at a lamp that sits precariously on a crate and knocks it across the room, where it shatters against the floor. "This has to stop. Right now. This -- this -- game you two play, where you tell each other secrets but keep them from me like I'm too inconsequential or stupid or weak to handle them."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我把事情弄得更糟糕了，我还说要给他们钱。”皮塔说道。突然，他一挥手猛地把一只歪歪斜斜放在板箱上的台灯扫出好远，台灯在地上摔得粉碎。“绝不能再这么下去了，现在就停止，这，这，是你们两个玩的游戏，你们俩说悄悄话，偏把我扔在一边，好像我又蠢又笨又软弱，啥也应付不了似的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's exactly like that!" he yells at me. "I have people I care about, too, Katniss! Family and friends back in District Twelve who will be just as dead as yours if we don't pull this thing off. So, after all we went through in the arena, don't I even rate the truth from you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“就是这么回事！”他冲我大喊，“我也有我爱的人，凯特尼斯！我在十二区也有家人和朋友，如果搞不好，他们也会像你的家人一样死去。咱们在竞技场一起历尽艰险，难道还换不来你的实话？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You're always so reliably good, Peeta," says Haymitch. "So smart about how you present yourself before the cameras. I didn't want to disrupt that."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你一向表现得很好，你很聪明，总知道在摄像机前怎样表现，我不想打破这一切。”黑密斯说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"He's right, Haymitch," I say. "We were wrong not to tell him. Even back in the Capitol."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“不是这样，皮塔”我说道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, you overestimated me. Because I really screwed up today. What do you think is going to happen to Rue's and Thresh's families? Do you think they'll get their share of our winnings? Do you think I gave them a bright future? Because I think they'll be lucky if they survive the day!" Peeta sends something else flying, a statue. I've never seen him like this.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“喏，你高估我了。瞧，我今天就把事情搞砸了。你觉的露露和萨里什的家人会怎样？他们能拿到奖金吗？你觉得我给了他们一个美好的未来？他们能活过今天就算幸运的啦！”说着他又摔碎了一个雕塑，我还从没见过他这样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Even in the arena, you two had some sort of system worked out, didn't you?" asks Peeta. His voice is quieter now. "Something I wasn't part of."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="确实，在竞技场我得到了烧伤药膏和面包，而在死亡线上苦苦挣扎的皮塔却一无所获。站在皮塔的角度他会怎么想，这事我以前从未认真想过。好像那时黑密斯要让我活下来，而牺牲了皮塔。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, I never had that opportunity. Because he never sent me anything until you showed up," says Peeta.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可我从来就没这事。在我见到你之前，他啥也没送给过我。”皮塔说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Don't bother, Haymitch. I know you had to choose one of us. And I'd have wanted it to be her. But this is something different. People are dead out there. More will follow unless we're very good. We all know I'm better than Katniss in front of the cameras. No one needs to coach me on what to say. But I have to know what I'm walking into," says Peeta.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不必了，黑密斯。我明白你必须在我们两人中选一个，我也希望是她。可现在不一样，外面已经死了人，除非我俩好好表现，不然会死更多人。咱们大家都清楚在摄像机前我比凯特尼斯表现好，该怎么说话我也不需要有人教，可问题是我也得清楚自己的处境。”皮塔说。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Well, I've learned one thing today. This place is not a larger version of District 12. Our fence is unguarded and rarely charged. Our Peacekeepers are unwelcome but less brutal. Our hardships evoke more fatigue than fury. Here in 11, they suffer more acutely and feel more desperation. President Snow is right. A spark could be enough to set them ablaze.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="是啊，今天我明白了一件事，十一区不是十二区的一个大号的翻版，在十二区，隔离网没有卫兵，也不通电，我们的治安警不招人喜欢，但也没那么残暴。我们度日艰难，可大家感到的是劳累，并没有激起愤怒。可在这里，在十一区，人们遭受了更大的痛苦和绝望。斯诺总统说得没错。隐藏在十一区人心中的熊熊怒火一触即发。">查看中文翻译</div>

While they try to predict what dishes will be served, I keep seeing the old man's head being blown off. I don't even pay attention to what anyone is doing to me until I'm about to leave and I see myself in the mirror. A pale pink strapless dress brushes my shoes.

Ride through cheering crowds. Listen to a speech in our honor. Give a thank-you speech in return, but only the one the Capitol gave us, never any personal additions now.

<div class="line_en">Even without our personal speeches to trigger dissent -- needless to say the ones we gave in District 11 were edited out before the event was broadcast -- you can feel something in the air, the rolling boil of a pot about to run over. Not everywhere. Some crowds have the weary-cattle feel that I know District 12 usually projects at the victors' ceremonies. But in others -- particularly 8, 4, and 3 -- there is genuine elation in the faces of the people at the sight of us, and under the elation, fury. When they chant my name, it is more of a cry for vengeance than a cheer. When the Peacekeepers move in to quiet an unruly crowd, it presses back instead of retreating. And I know that there's nothing I could ever do to change this. No show of love, however believable, will turn this tide. If my holding out those berries was an act of temporary insanity, then these people will embrace insanity, too.</div>

<div class="line_en">Cinna begins to take in my clothes around the waist. The prep team frets over the circles under my eyes. Effie starts giving me pills to sleep, but they don't work. Not well enough. I drift off only to be roused by nightmares that have increased in number and intensity. Peeta, who spends much of the night roaming the train, hears me screaming as I struggle to break out of the haze of drugs that merely prolong the horrible dreams. He manages to wake me and calm me down. Then he climbs into bed to hold me until I fall back to sleep. After that, I refuse the pills. But every night I let him into my bed. We manage the darkness as we did in the arena, wrapped in each other's arms, guarding against dangers that can descend at any moment. Nothing else happens, but our arrangement quickly becomes a subject of gossip on the train.</div>

I suppose that before the Games I didn't pay attention, and afterward I didn't want to know.</div>
