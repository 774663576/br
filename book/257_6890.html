<div class="line_en">That evening I visited the house, and met Clara, a lovely girl, obviously in love with Herbert. How lucky she and Herbert were! I thought of Estella, and felt very sad.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Our friend is there now," said Wemmick, "and you can visit him tonight, but don't go back there after that. And remember, Mr Pip," he added firmly, "remember to get his cash. You don't know what may happen to him. Don't let anything happen to his cash."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“现在，我们的朋友在这里，”文米克说，“你今晚就能拜访他。不过，在这之后不要回那儿。记住，匹普先生，”他紧接着说，“记住得到他的钱，你不知道对他来说会发生什么，不要让他的钱发生任何事情。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I could not explain to Wemmick how I felt about Magwich's money, so I said nothing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我高不清文米克怎么会惦记马格韦契的钱。因此，我什么也没说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I spent a restless night at a hotel, worrying about the reasons for Wemmick's warning. Early in the morning I went to see him at the Castle. He told me he had heard I was being watched, and that someone was looking for Magwitch. He also knew that Compeyson was alive and in London. While I was absent, Wemmick had warned Herbert to move our guest to a safer place. Clara, the girl Herbert was in love with, lived with her old father in a house on the river, quite near the open sea, and Herbert had arranged to rent rooms for Magwitch in this house. It was further away from the centre of London and our home, and we could easily take Magwitch abroad by boat from there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我在一家旅店度过了一个不眠之夜，为文米克警告的原因担忧。一大早我去那个城堡见他，他告诉我，他听说有人正监视我，有人正在寻找马格韦契，他还知道康培生还活着，在伦敦。当我不在的时候，文米克已经提醒赫伯特把我们的客人转移到安全的地方。克莱拉，这个和赫伯特相爱的姑娘，和她父亲住在靠近河边的一座房子里，离宽阔的大海很近。赫伯特已经安排了在这座房子里为马格韦契租间房子，这座房子离伦敦市中心和我们的家很远。从这里，我们能很容易地通过船把马格韦契送往国外。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I decided to keep a rowing boat near our rooms, so that Herbert or I could row up and down the river, as far as Clara's house. If Magwitch saw us on the river, he could draw his bedroom curtain to show everything was all right.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我决定在我们住处的附近雇用一只小划船，以便我或者赫伯特能在河道里划来划去，能划到克莱拉的家那么远。如果马格韦契在河上看到我们，拉开他卧室的窗帘就能很好地展示一切。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One evening, instead of reading alone in my room, I went to the theatre where Mr Wopsle was acting. He noticed me in the audience, and kept looking at me in a very strange way. After the play we met outside the theatre, and he asked immediately,</div>

<div class="line_en">About a week later I met Mr Jaggers by chance in the street, and he invited me to dinner that evening. Wemmick was there too. Mr Jaggers told me Miss Havisham wished to see me on business, so I said I would go the next day.</div>

<div class="line_en">Later, as Wemmick and I left Jaggers' house together, I asked him about his employer's housekeeper. He told me that, many years before, she had been jealous of her husband and another woman, and had been accused of murdering this woman. Jaggers was her lawyer, and at her trial he managed to show that she was not strong enough to kill anyone. She was also suspected of killing her three-year-old daughter, who had disappeared. But because of Jaggers' clever arguing, she was judged innocent of murder. After the trial she left her husband and became Jaggers' housekeeper.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后来，当我和文米克一起离开贾格斯的家时，我问他有关他的雇主女管家。他告诉我，很多年以前，她猜疑她丈夫和另外一个女人好，被指控谋杀这个女人。贾格斯是她的律师，在她的判决中，他设法表明她体弱不能杀害其他人。也怀疑她杀害了3岁的女儿，她女儿已经失踪了。但是，因为贾格斯的聪明善辩，所以判决她的谋杀罪不能成立。判决后，她离开了她丈夫，成了贾格斯的女管家。">查看中文翻译</div>
