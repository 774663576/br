<div class="line_en">He had expected it to be empty, but when he reached the door he heard the soft rumble of voices on the other side. He pushed it open and saw Mr. and Mrs. Weasley, Sirius, Lupin, and Tonks sitting there almost as though they were waiting for him. All were fully dressed except Mrs. Weasley, who was wearing a quilted purple dressing gown. She leapt to her feet the moment Harry entered.</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry awoke at half-past five the next morning as abruptly and completely as if somebody had yelled in his ear. For a few moments he lay immobile as the prospect of the disciplinary hearing filled every tiny particle of his brain, then, unable to bear it, he leapt out of bed and put on his glasses. Mrs. Weasley had laid out his freshly laundered jeans and T-shirt at the foot of his bed. Harry scrambled into them. The blank picture on the wall sniggered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天早晨五点半，哈利猛地一下完全清醒过来，就好像有人冲他耳朵里大喊了一声。他一动不动地躺在那里，慢慢地，要去魔法部受审的事充满了他大脑的每个细胞。他再也无法忍受了，就从床上跳下来，戴上了眼镜。韦斯莱夫人已经把洗熨一新的牛仔裤和T恤衫放在了他的床脚边。哈利摸索着穿上它们。墙上那幅空白的画纸在吃吃发笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ron was lying sprawled on his back with his mouth wide open, fast asleep. He did not stir as Harry crossed the room, stepped out on to the landing and closed the door softly behind him. Trying not to think of the next time he would see Ron, when they might no longer be fellow students at Hogwarts, Harry walked quietly down the stairs, past the heads of Kreacher's ancestors, and down into the kitchen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗恩四肢舒展地仰面躺在床上，嘴巴张得大大的，睡得正香。哈利穿过房间，来到门外的楼梯平台上，反手把门轻轻关上，罗恩一直没有动弹。哈利竭力不去想当他下次再见到罗恩时，他们可能已经不再是霍格沃茨的同学了。他轻手轻脚地走下楼梯，经过克利切祖先的那些脑袋，来到下面的厨房里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry felt vaguely grateful that he was not required to join in the conversation. His insides were squirming. Mrs. Weasley placed a couple of pieces of toast and marmalade in front of him; he tried to eat, but it was like chewing carpet. Mrs Weasley sat down on his other side and started fussing with his T-shirt, tucking in the label and smoothing out the creases across his shoulders. He wished she wouldn't.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr. Weasley kept his hand inside his jacket as they walked. Harry knew it was clenched around his wand. The run-down streets were almost deserted, but when they arrived at the miserable little underground station they found it already lull of early-morning commuters. As ever when he found himself in close proximity to Muggles going about their daily business, Mr. Weasley was hard put to contain his enthusiasm.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="韦斯莱先生走路时一只手插在夹克衫里，哈利知道那手里一定攥着魔杖。破败的街道上几乎一个人也没有，可是当他们走进寒酸的、不起眼的地铁车站时，发现里面已经挤满了早晨上班的乘客。韦斯莱先生难以抑制内心的浓厚兴趣，他每次发现自己与正在处理日常事务的麻瓜们近在咫尺时都是这样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They bought their tickets instead from a sleepy-looking guard (Harry handled the transaction, as Mr. Weasley was not very good with Muggle money) and five minutes later they were boarding an underground train that rattled them off towards the centre of London. Mr. Weasley kept anxiously checking and re-checking the Underground Map above the windows.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们还是从一个睡眼惺忪的管理员手里买了地铁票（这笔交易是哈利完成的，因为韦斯莱先生不太搞得清麻瓜的货币），五分钟后，他们登上了地铁。地铁载着他们哐啷哐啷地朝伦敦市中心驶去。韦斯莱先生紧张地一遍遍核对窗户上面的地铁路线图。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They got off at a station in the very heart of London, and were swept from the train in a tide of besuited men and women carrying briefcases. Up the escalator they went, through the ticket barrier (Mr. Weasley delighted with the way the stile swallowed his ticket), and emerged on to a broad street lined with imposing-looking buildings and already full of traffic.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们在伦敦市中心的一站下了车，人流如潮，他们被无数衣冠楚楚、提着公文包的男男女女推挤着出了地铁。他们上了自动扶梯，通过检票处（韦斯莱先生看到旋转栅门那样灵巧地吞下他的车票，显得非常高兴），来到一条宽阔的街道上，两边都是威严壮观的建筑物，街上已经是车水马龙。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was a click and a rattle, and Harry saw something slide out of the metal chute where returned coins usually appeared. He picked it up: it was a square silver badge with Harry Potter, Disciplinary Hearing on it. He pinned it to the front of his T-shirt as the female voice spoke again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="点击了一下，发出嘎嘎声，哈利看见什么东西从平常用来退出硬币的金属斜槽里滑了出来。他把它拿了起来：是一个方方正正的银色徽章，上面写着：哈利波特，受审。他把徽章别在T恤衫前，那个女人的声音又响起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Er…" said Mr. Weasley, clearly uncertain whether or not he should talk into the receiver. He compromised by holding the mouthpiece to his ear, "Arthur Weasley, Misuse of Muggle Artefacts Office, here to escort Harry Potter, who has been asked to attend a disciplinary hearing…"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嗯…”韦斯莱先生说，显然拿不准是不是应该对着话筒说话。最后他做了让步，把送话口贴在了耳朵上，“亚瑟韦斯莱，禁止滥用麻瓜物品司，是陪哈利波特来的，部里要求他来受审。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The floor of the telephone box shuddered. They were sinking slowly into the ground. Harry watched apprehensively as the pavement seemed to rise up past the glass windows of the telephone box until darkness closed over their heads. Then he could see nothing at all; he could hear only a dull grinding noise as the telephone box made its way down through the earth. After about a minute, though it felt much longer to Harry, a chink of golden light illuminated his feet and, widening, rose up his body, until it hit him in the face and he had to blink to stop his eyes watering.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="电话亭的地面突然颤抖起来。他们慢慢沉入了地下。哈利惊恐地看着电话亭玻璃窗外的人行道越升越高，最后他们头顶上一片黑暗。他什么也看不见了，只能听见电话亭陷入地下时发出的单调、刺耳的摩擦声。过了大约一分钟，但哈利感觉要长得多，一道细细的金光照到他的脚上，随后金光逐渐变宽，扩大到他的身体上，最后直射他的面孔，他不得不使劲眨着眼睛，以免眼泪流出来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The door of the telephone box sprang open and Mr. Weasley stepped out of it, followed by Harry, whose mouth had fallen open.</div>

<div class="line_en">Halfway down the hall was a fountain. A group of golden statues, larger than life-size, stood in the middle of a circular pool. Tallest of them all was a noble-looking wizard with his wand pointing straight up in the air. Grouped around him were a beautiful witch, a centaur, a goblin and a house-elf. The last three were all looking adoringly up at the witch and wizard. Glittering jets of water were flying from the ends of the two wands, the point of the centaur's arrow, the tip of the goblin's hat, and each of the house-elf's ears, so that the tinkling hiss of falling water was added to the pops and cracks of the Apparators and the clatter of footsteps as hundreds of witches and wizards, most of whom were wearing glum, early-morning looks, strode towards a set of golden gates at the far end of the hall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="门厅中间是一个喷泉。一个圆形的水潭中闯竖立着一组纯金雕像，比真人还大。其中最高的是一个风度高贵的男巫，高举着魔杖，直指天空。围在他周围的是一个美丽的女巫、一个马人、一个妖精和一个家养小精灵。马人、妖精和家养小精灵都无限崇拜地抬头望着那两个巫师。一道道闪亮的水柱从巫师的魔杖顶端，从马人的箭头上，从妖精的帽子尖，从家养小精灵的两只耳朵里喷射出来。四下里有丁冬丁冬、哗啦哗啦的水声，有幻影移形的人发出的噗、啪的声音，还有几百个男女巫师杂乱的脚步声。他们脸上挂着早晨特有的死气沉沉的表情，大步流星地朝门厅那头的一排金色大门走去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They were standing at one end of a very long and splendid hall with a highly polished, dark wood floor. The peacock blue ceiling was inlaid with gleaming golden symbols that kept moving and changing like some enormous heavenly noticeboard. The wall's on each side were panelled in shiny dark wood and had many gilded fireplaces set into them. Every few seconds a witch or wizard would emerge from one of the left-hand fireplaces with a soft whoosh; on the right-hand side, short queues were forming before each fireplace, waiting to depart.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们站在一个很长的金碧辉煌的大厅一头，地上是擦得光亮鉴人的深色木地板。孔雀蓝的天花板上镶嵌着闪闪发光的金色符号，不停地活动着、变化着，像是一个巨大的高空布告栏。四面的墙壁都镶着乌黑油亮的深色木板，许多镀金的壁炉嵌在木板里。每过几秒钟，随着噗的一声轻响，就有一个巫师从左边某个壁炉里突然冒出来。而在右边，每个壁炉前都有几个人在排队等着离开。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“这边走，哈利。”韦斯莱先生说，他们离开了那些朝金色大门走去的魔法部职员的人流。在左边的一张桌子旁，在一个写着“安全检查”的牌子下，坐着一个穿孔雀蓝长袍、胡子刮得很不干净的巫师。他们走近时，他抬起头，放下了手里的《预言家日报》。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They joined the throng, wending their way between the Ministry workers, some of whom were carrying tottering piles of parchment, others battered briefcases, still others were reading the Daily Prophet while they walked.

<div class="line_en">Harry produced his wand. The wizard dropped it on to a strange brass instrument, which looked something like a set of scales with only one dish. It began to vibrate. A narrow strip of parchment came speeding out of a slit in the base. The wizard tore this off and read the writing on it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利把魔杖交了出去。那巫师把它扔在一个怪模怪样的、像是一个单盘天平的黄铜机器上。机器开始微微振动。一条窄窄的羊皮纸从底部的一道口子里飞快地吐了出来。那巫师把纸扯了下来，读着上面的字。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jostled slightly by the crowd, Harry followed Mr. Weasley through the gates into the smaller hall beyond, where at least twenty lifts stood behind wrought golden grilles.

<div class="line_cn" title="哈利被人群推挤着，跟韦斯莱先生穿过大门，来到那边一个较小的大厅里。那儿至少有二十部电梯，被精制的金色栅栏门挡着。哈利和韦斯莱先生走到围着一部电梯前的人群中。旁边站着一个胡子拉碴的大个子巫师，怀里抱着一个大纸板箱，里面发出刺耳的摩擦声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">With a great jangling and clattering a lift descended in front of them; the golden grille slid back and Harry and Mr. Weasley stepped into the lift with the rest of the crowd and Harry found himself jammed against the back wall. Several witches and wizards were looking at him curiously; he stared at his feet to avoid catching anyone's eye, flattening his fringe as he did so. The grilles slid shut with a crash and the lift ascended slowly, chains rattling, while the same cool female voice Harry had heard in the telephone box rang out again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="随着丁丁当当、咔啦咔啦的一阵响动，一个电梯降落到他们面前。金色的栅栏门轻轻滑开，哈利和韦斯莱先生与那伙人一起走进电梯，哈利发现自己被挤得贴在了后面的墙上。几个巫师好奇地打量着他。他低头望着脚尖，避免与别人的目光相对，一边用手抹平额前的刘海。栅栏门哗啦一声关上了，电梯慢慢上升，链条咔啦啦作响，哈利在电话亭里听见过的那个冷漠的女人声音又响了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

The doors closed, the lift juddered upwards again and the woman's voice announced:</div>

Two desks had been crammed inside it and there was barely space to move around them because of all the overflowing filing cabinets lining the walls, on top of which were tottering piles of files. The little wall space available bore witness to Mr. Weasley's obsessions; there were several posters of cars, including one of a dismantled engine, two illustrations of postboxes he seemed to have cut out of Muggle children's books, and a diagram showing how to wire a plug.</div>
