<div class="line_en">After lunching in the basement of the Medical School Philip went back to his rooms. It was Saturday afternoon, and the landlady was cleaning the stairs.</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip wondered what this could mean. He took a book and began to read. It was Burton's Journey to Meccah, which he had just got out of the Westminster Public Library; and he read the first page, but could make no sense of it, for his mind was elsewhere; he was listening all the time for a ring at the bell. He dared not hope that Griffiths had gone away already, without Mildred, to his home in Cumberland. Mildred would be coming presently for the money. He set his teeth and read on; he tried desperately to concentrate his attention; the sentences etched themselves in his brain by the force of his effort, but they were distorted by the agony he was enduring. He wished with all his heart that he had not made the horrible proposition to give them money; but now that he had made it he lacked the strength to go back on it, not on Mildred's account, but on his own. There was a morbid obstinacy in him which forced him to do the thing he had determined. He discovered that the three pages he had read had made no impression on him at all; and he went back and started from the beginning: he found himself reading one sentence over and over again; and now it weaved itself in with his thoughts, horribly, like some formula in a nightmare. One thing he could do was to go out and keep away till midnight; they could not go then; and he saw them calling at the house every hour to ask if he was in. He enjoyed the thought of their disappointment. He repeated that sentence to himself mechanically. But he could not do that. Let them come and take the money, and he would know then to what depths of infamy it was possible for men to descend. He could not read any more now. He simply could not see the words. He leaned back in his chair, closing his eyes, and, numb with misery, waited for Mildred.</div>

<div class="line_en">He got up at last, exhausted and ashamed, and washed his face. He mixed himself a strong whiskey and soda. It made him feel a little better. Then he caught sight of the tickets to Paris, which were on the chimney-piece, and, seizing them, with an impulse of rage he flung them in the fire. He knew he could have got the money back on them, but it relieved him to destroy them. Then he went out in search of someone to be with. The club was empty. He felt he would go mad unless he found someone to talk to; but Lawson was abroad; he went on to Hayward's rooms: the maid who opened the door told him that he had gone down to Brighton for the week-end. Then Philip went to a gallery and found it was just closing. He did not know what to do. He was distracted. And he thought of Griffiths and Mildred going to Oxford, sitting opposite one another in the train, happy. He went back to his rooms, but they filled him with horror, he had been so wretched in them; he tried once more to read Burton's book, but, as he read, he told himself again and again what a fool he had been; it was he who had made the suggestion that they should go away, he had offered the money, he had forced it upon them; he might have known what would happen when he introduced Griffiths to Mildred; his own vehement passion was enough to arouse the other's desire. By this time they had reached Oxford. They would put up in one of the lodging-houses in John Street; Philip had never been to Oxford, but Griffiths had talked to him about it so much that he knew exactly where they would go; and they would dine at the Clarendon: Griffiths had been in the habit of dining there when he went on the spree. Philip got himself something to eat in a restaurant near Charing Cross; he had made up his mind to go to a play, and afterwards he fought his way into the pit of a theatre at which one of Oscar Wilde's pieces was being performed. He wondered if Mildred and Griffiths would go to a play that evening: they must kill the evening somehow; they were too stupid, both of them to content themselves with conversation: he got a fierce delight in reminding himself of the vulgarity of their minds which suited them so exactly to one another. He watched the play with an abstracted mind, trying to give himself gaiety by drinking whiskey in each interval; he was unused to alcohol, and it affected him quickly, but his drunkenness was savage and morose. When the play was over he had another drink. He could not go to bed, he knew he would not sleep, and he dreaded the pictures which his vivid imagination would place before him. He tried not to think of them. He knew he had drunk too much. Now he was seized with a desire to do horrible, sordid things; he wanted to roll himself in gutters; his whole being yearned for beastliness; he wanted to grovel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后他从床上站起身，哭得筋疲力竭，羞愧不已。他洗洗脸，用威士忌和苏打水调了杯烈酒。酒一下肚，心情就好了些。忽然看见壁炉架上还放着两张去巴黎的火车票，怒气猛地上头，便一把抓过来扔到了火炉里。他明知可以退了票换钱，但似乎看着它们一点点烧成灰才更能解恨。他想出门找个伴儿，可酒馆里空无一人。要是现在身边没个能说话的人，那他非得发疯不可。劳森不在英国，他只好去海沃德家，可给他开门的女仆告诉他说海沃德去了布莱顿过周末。兜兜转转，又到了美术馆，却发现那里大门紧闭。他心烦意乱，不知道还能做什么，闭上眼睛，仿佛看到此时格里菲斯和米尔德里德可能正坐在去牛津的火车上，面对面地傻笑着。无奈，他打道回府，可家里的一切都令他不寒而栗。他在这度过了太多心酸痛苦的时光。想再拾起伯顿的书往下读，读着读着脑海里却一直有个声音在责骂自己是个傻子。正是他主动建议让他们出去玩玩，也正是他自掏腰包把他们送走：是他逼着他们去的！他在介绍格里菲斯给米尔德里德认识的时候，就该清楚会有什么后果。他这么热心地张罗，迫不及待地让两人见面，他们之间不擦出点火花来倒才奇怪。这个点儿，他们应该已经到牛津了吧。肯定住在约翰大街的公寓。虽然菲利普从没去过牛津，但格里菲斯却和他说了不少那里的事，所以，他们到了那儿要住在哪家旅馆、要去哪里游玩，菲利普心里都一清二楚。他们会去卡拉伦登吃饭，每当格里菲斯想要狂欢作乐，总是会跑去这家餐馆。菲利普在查令十字街旁边的馆子吃了点东西，决意要去剧院看场戏，于是买了张票，从人群里一路挤到最后一排。这家剧院上演的正是王尔德的一出戏。不知道格里菲斯和米尔德里德今晚会不会也去，他们晚上总得找点事做打发时间吧，这愚不可耐的两个人，光是聊天肯定一会儿就觉得无聊了。想起他俩庸俗透顶的头脑，菲利普忽然感到一阵愉快——真是臭味相投，看对眼儿了。他心不在焉地看着表演，每到一幕结束就去吧台点杯威士忌喝。他酒量很小，没几口就喝得醉醺醺的了，一会儿骂骂咧咧，一会儿闷闷不乐。戏刚演完，就又去喝了一杯。他知道自己肯定睡不着，所以压根也不上床了，生怕躺在床上就会想到那对狗男女，想到两人交欢作乐的龌龊画面。他知道自己喝多了，失去了理智。此刻只求无止境地堕落下去，肮脏的兽欲吞噬了他。他想蜷缩在阴沟，想扑倒在地，匍匐尘中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He shook hands with her. Through the curtains he watched her jump into a four-wheeler that stood at the door. It rolled away. Then he threw himself on his bed and hid his face in his hands. He felt tears coming to his eyes, and he was angry with himself; he clenched his hands and screwed up his body to prevent them; but he could not; and great painful sobs were forced from him.</div>
