<div class="line_en">"I don't think it's fair for some girls to have plenty of pretty things, and other girls nothing at all," added little Amy, with an injured sniff.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“有些女孩子拥有荣华富贵，有些却一无所有，我认为这不公平。”艾美鼻子轻轻一哼，三分出于轻蔑，七分出于嫉妒。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“但我们有父母姐妹，”坐在一角的贝思提出抗议。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The four young faces on which the firelight shone brightened at the cheerful words, but darkened again as Jo said sadly, "We haven't got Father, and shall not have him for a long time." She didn't say "perhaps never," but each silently added it, thinking of Father far away, where the fighting was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这句令人愉快的话使炉火映照下的四张年轻的脸庞明亮起来。”我们没有父亲，很长一段时间都将没有，”乔伤心地说。听到这句话，大家的脸又暗淡下去。她虽没“可能永远没”，但每个人心里都把这句话悄悄说了一遍，同时想起远在战场的父亲。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Nobody spoke for a minute; then Meg said in an altered tone, "You know the reason Mother proposed not having any presents this Christmas was because it is going to be a hard winter for everyone; and she thinks we ought not to spend money for pleasure, when our men are suffering so in the army. We can't do much, but we can make our little sacrifices, and ought to do it gladly. But I am afraid I don't," and Meg shook her head, as she thought regretfully of all the pretty things she wanted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大家一时无言。一会梅格换了个声调说：“你们知道妈妈为什么建议今年圣诞节不派礼物吗？因为寒冷的冬天就要来了，而我们的男人在军营里受苦受难，我们不应该花钱寻乐。虽然我们能力有限，但可以在这方面做出一点小小的牺牲，而且应该做得高高兴兴。不过我可并不高兴。”梅格摇摇脑袋。想到那些梦寐以求的漂亮礼物，她感到遗憾不已。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"But I don't think the little we should spend would do any good. We've each got a dollar, and the army wouldn't be much helped by our giving that. I agree not to expect anything from Mother or you, but I do want to buy Undine and Sintran for myself. I've wanted it so long," said Jo, who was a bookworm.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我看我们那丁点儿钱也帮不上什么忙。我们每人只得一元钱，献给部队也没多大用处。我们不要期待妈妈给我们什么礼物，不过我真的很想买一本《水中女神》，那本书我早就想买了，”乔说。她是个蛀书虫。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Mother didn't say anything about our money, and she won't wish us to give up everything. Let's each buy what we want, and have a little fun; I'm sure we work hard enough to earn it," cried Jo, examining the heels of her shoes in a gentlemanly manner.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“妈妈没说过这钱该怎么花，要是看着我们两手空空，她也不会高兴的。我们倒不如各自买点自己喜欢的东西高兴高兴。为挣这些钱，我们花了我多少心血！“乔大声说道，蛮有绅士风度地审视着自己的鞋跟。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你何尝赶得上我辛苦呢？”乔说，”想想好几个小时和一个吹毛求疵、神经质的老太太关在一起，被她使唤得团团转，她却永远不会感到满意，把你折腾得真想从这个世界上消失或者干脆大哭一场，你会感觉怎样？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's naughty to fret, but I do think washing dishes and keeping things tidy is the worst work in the world. It makes me cross, and my hands get so stiff, I can't practice well at all." And Beth looked at her rough hands with a sigh that any one could hear that time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“怨天尤人并不好，但我真的觉得洗碗打扫房子是全世界最痛苦的事情。这让我脾气暴躁不算，双手也变得僵硬，连琴也弹不了。”贝思望着自己粗糙的双手叹一口气，这回每个人都听到了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I don't believe any of you suffer as I do," cried Amy, "for you don't have to go to school with impertinent girls, who plague you if you don't know your lessons, and laugh at your dresses, and label your father if he isn't rich, and insult you when your nose isn't nice."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不相信有谁比我更痛苦，”艾美嚷道，”因为你们都不用去上学。那些女孩子粗俗无礼，如果你不懂功课，她们就让你下不了台，她们笑话你的衣着，爸爸没有钱要被她们标价，鼻子长得不漂亮也要被她们侮辱。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“小巢里的鸟儿一致同意，”和平使者贝思唱起歌儿，脸上的表情滑稽有趣。尖着嗓门的两人化为一笑，“斗嘴”就此结束。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Really, girls, you are both to be blamed," said Meg, beginning to lecture in her elder-sisterly fashion. "You are old enough to leave off boyish tricks, and to behave better, Josephine. It didn't matter so much when you were a little girl, but now you are so tall, and turn up your hair, you should remember that you are a young lady."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我说姑娘们，你们两个都不对，”梅格开始以姐姐的身份说教，”约瑟芬，你已经长大了，不应再玩男孩子的把戏，应该检点一些。你还是小姑娘时这倒没有什么，但你现在已长得这么高，而且网起了头发，就得记住自己是个年轻女士。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm not! And if turning up my hair makes me one, I'll wear it in two tails till I'm twenty," cried Jo, pulling off her net, and shaking down a chestnut mane. "I hate to think I've got to grow up, and be Miss March, and wear long gowns, and look as prim as a China Aster! It's bad enough to be a girl, anyway, when I like boy's games and work and manners! I can't get over my disappointment in not being a boy. And it's worse than ever now, for I'm dying to go and fight with Papa. And I can only stay home and knit, like a poky old woman!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不是！如果网起头发就把我当女士的话，我就梳两条辫子，直到二十岁，”乔大声叫起来。她拉掉发网，披落一头栗色的厚发。”我恨我得长大，得做马奇小姐。我恨穿长礼服，恨故作正经的漂亮小姐。我喜欢男孩子的游戏，男孩子的活儿以及男孩子风度，却偏偏是个女孩子，真是倒霉透了。做不成男孩真让我止不住失望，可现在比以往任何时候都要糟，因为我是那么想跟爸爸一起参加战斗，却只能呆坐在家中做女工，像个死气沉沉的老太太！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"As for you, Amy," continued Meg, "you are altogether too particular and prim. Your airs are funny now, but you'll grow up an affected little goose, if you don't take care.

<div class="line_en">As young readers like to know 'how people look', we will take this moment to give them a little sketch of the four sisters, who sat knitting away in the twilight, while the December snow fell quietly without, and the fire crackled cheerfully within. It was a comfortable room, though the carpet was faded and the furniture very plain, for a good picture or two hung on the walls, books filled the recesses, chrysanthemums and Christmas roses bloomed in the windows, and a pleasant atmosphere of home peace pervaded it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="由于年轻的读者们喜欢知道“人物样“，我们趁此机会把坐在黄昏的余辉下做针线活儿的四姐妹概略描述一下。此时屋外的冬雪正轻轻飘落，屋内炉火噼啪欢响。虽然这间旧房子铺着褪了色的地毯，摆设也相当简单，但却显得十分舒适：墙上挂着一两幅雅致的图画，壁凹内堆满了书本，窗台上是绽放的菊花和圣诞花，屋里洋溢着一片宁静、温馨的气氛。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Margaret, the eldest of the four, was sixteen, and very pretty, being plump and fair, with large eyes, plenty of soft brown hair, a sweet mouth, and white hands, of which she was rather vain. Fifteen-year-old Jo was very tall, thin, and brown, and reminded one of a colt, for she never seemed to know what to do with her long limbs, which were very much in her way. She had a decided mouth, a comical nose, and sharp, gray eyes, which appeared to see everything, and were by turns fierce, funny, or thoughtful. Her long, thick hair was her one beauty, but it was usually bundled into a net, to be out of her way. Round shoulders had Jo, big hands and feet, a flyaway look to her clothes, and the uncomfortable appearance of a girl who was rapidly shooting up into a woman and didn't like it. Elizabeth, or Beth, as everyone called her, was a rosy, smooth-haired, bright-eyed girl of thirteen, with a shy manner, a timid voice, and a peaceful expression which was seldom disturbed. Her father called her 'Little Miss Tranquility', and the name suited her excellently, for she seemed to live in a happy world of her own, only venturing out to meet the few whom she trusted and loved. Amy, though the youngest, was a most important person, in her own opinion at least. A regular snow maiden, with blue eyes, and yellow hair curling on her shoulders, pale and slender, and always carrying herself like a young lady mindful of her manners. What the characters of the four sisters were we will leave to be found out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大姐玛格丽特，十六岁，出落得十分标致。她体态丰盈，肌肤洁白，大大的眼睛，甜甜的笑容，一头棕色秀发又浓又厚，双手白皙，这令她颇为自得。十五岁的乔身材修长，皮肤黝黑，见了使人想到一匹小公马，因为她修长的四肢相当碍事，她仿佛总是不知道该如何处置它们。她嘴巴刚毅，鼻子俊俏，灰色的眼睛异常敏锐，似乎能看穿一切，眼神时而炽烈，时而风趣，时而又像在沉思。浓密的长发使她显得特别美丽，但为了方便长发通常被她束入发网。她双肩圆润，大手大脚，穿着又宽又大的衣服。正迅速长成一个成熟的女性，心里却极不愿，因此常常流露出这个阶段的女孩所特有的尴尬神情。伊丽莎白，人称贝思，十三岁，肤色红润，秀发润泽，目如秋波。她举止腼腆，声音羞怯，神情宁静而深远，被父亲称“小宁”，此名非她莫属，因为她似乎独个生活在自己的伊甸园中，只敢出来会会几个最亲最信任的人。艾美虽然最小，却是个十分重要的人物。至少她自我感觉如此。她生得纤细端庄，肌骨晶莹，一双蓝眼睛，金黄色的头发卷曲披落肩头，言谈举止十足一个讲究风度的年轻女子。四姐妹的性格如何，我们后面分解。">查看中文翻译</div>
