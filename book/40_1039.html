<div class="line_en">The gun was red, the trigger guard bright green. Behind the gun loomed Khadim's grinning face. Khadim was eleven, like Tariq. He was thick, tall, and had a severe underbite. His father was a butcher in Deh-Mazang, and, from time to time, Khadim was known to fling bits of calf intestine at passersby. Sometimes, if Tariq wasn't nearby, Khadim shadowed Laila in the schoolyard at recess, leering, making little whining noises. One time, he'd tapped her on the shoulder and said, You're so very pretty, Yellow Hair. I want to marry you.</div>

<div class="line_en">SOMETIMES MAMMY had good days. She sprang out of bed bright-eyed and playful. The droopy lower lip stretched upward in a smile. She bathed. She put on fresh clothes and wore mascara. She let Laila brush her hair, which Laila loved doing, and pin earrings through her earlobes. They went shopping together to Mandaii Bazaar. Laila got her to play snakes and ladders, and they ate shavings from blocks of dark chocolate, one of the few things they shared a common taste for. Laila's favorite part of Mammy's good days was when Babi came home, when she and Mammy looked up from the board and grinned at him with brown teeth. A gust of contentment puffed through the room then, and Laila caught a momentary glimpse of the tenderness, the romance, that had once bound her parents back when this house had been crowded and noisy and cheerful.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="妈妈也有心情好的日子。她双眼发亮，轻松愉快地起床。她那低垂的下唇向上弯成一个微笑。她洗澡。她穿上干净的衣服，涂上睫毛膏。她让莱拉替她梳头——莱拉很喜欢这么做，把耳环穿进她的耳洞。她们一起去曼戴伊市场购物。莱拉和她一起玩“毒蛇爬梯子”的游戏，她们吃着从大块的黑色巧克力削下来的刨花，这是少数她们两人都喜欢的东西之一。妈妈心情好的日子里，最让莱拉高兴的是爸爸回家的时刻，她和妈妈会从游戏板上抬起头，朝他咧嘴而笑，露出缀满黑巧克力的牙齿。每当这个时候，房间就会飘过一阵愉快的气氛，莱拉便能体会到一丝令她终生难忘的柔情；从前，当这座房子还很拥挤、充满喧闹和欢乐的时候，围绕着她父母的，该是怎样的温柔和浪漫啊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When the worst of it had passed, she went across the hallway to Mammy's door and knocked. When she was younger, Laila used to sit for hours outside this door. She would tap on it and whisper Mammy's name over and over, like a magic chant meant to break a spell: Mammy, Mammy, Mammy, Mammy… But Mammy never opened the door. She didn't open it now. Laila turned the knob and walked in.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="稍微平息之后，她沿着走廊，来到妈妈的房间门口，敲敲门。早些年，莱拉常常在这个门口一坐几个钟头。她会轻轻敲门，像一个试图解开魔咒的魔法师，一次又一次地低声叫着妈妈：妈妈，妈妈，妈妈……但妈妈从来不会打开这扇门。这回她也没有把门打开。莱拉转动门把手，走了进去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This would have never happened if Tariq had been with her, she thought as she put on a clean shirt and fresh trousers. Khadim wouldn't have dared. Of course, it wouldn't have happened if Mammy had shown up like she was supposed to either. Sometimes Laila wondered why Mammy had even bothered having her. People, she believed now, shouldn't be allowed to have new children if they'd already given away all their love to their old ones. It wasn't fair. A fit of anger claimed her. Laila went to her room, collapsed on her bed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她换上干净的衬衣和裤子，换的时候，她心想，要是塔里克和她在一起，就不会发生这种事情了。当然，妈妈本该去接她的，如果她去了，这样的情况也不会出现。有时候，莱拉想不明白妈妈干吗要把她生下来。现在她认为，如果人们的爱全都给了他们已经生下来的孩子，那么他们就不应该再生其他的了。太不公平了。她心中升起一阵怒火。莱拉走进自己的房间，躺倒在床上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mammy sometimes baked on her good days and invited neighborhood women over for tea and pastries. Laila got to lick the bowls clean, as Mammy set the table with cups and napkins and the good plates. Later, Laila would take her place at the living-room table and try to break into the conversation, as the women talked boisterously and drank tea and complimented Mammy on her baking. Though there was never much for her to say, Laila liked to sit and listen in because at these gatherings she was treated to a rare pleasure: She got to hear Mammy speaking affectionately about Babi.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在她心情好的日子，妈妈有时候会烘焙一些点心，邀请住在附近的妇女过来喝茶和吃饼干。当妈妈给桌子摆上茶杯、纸巾和盘子的时候，莱拉会帮忙把一些碗擦干净。然后，当这些女人七嘴八舌地说话，恭维妈妈做的点心很好吃时，莱拉会在客厅的桌子旁边坐下，试图也插上几句。不过她的话向来不多，莱拉喜欢坐下听她们聊天，因为在这些场合，人们把她当成稀世珍宝，她还可以听到妈妈充满感情地说起爸爸。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"What a first-rate teacher he was," Mammy said. "His students loved him. And not only because he wouldn't beat them with rulers, like other teachers did. They respected him, you see, because he respected them. He was marvelous."</div>

I used to climb the wall between our houses, and we'd play in his father's orchard. Hakim was always scared that we'd get caught and that my father would give him a slapping. 'Your father's going to give me a slapping,' he'd always say. He was so cautious, so serious, even then. And then one day I said to him, I said, 'Cousin, what will it be? Are you going to ask for my hand or are you going to make me come khastegari to you?' I said it just like that. You should have seen the face on him!"</div>

<div class="line_en">Inevitably, Mammy's proposal story led to matchmaking schemes. When Afghanistan was free from the Soviets and the boys returned home, they would need brides, and so, one by one, the women paraded the neighborhood girls who might or might not be suitable for Ahmad and Noor. Laila always felt excluded when the talk turned to her brothers, as though the women were discussing a beloved film that only she hadn't seen. She'd been two years old when Ahmad and Noor had left Kabul for Panjshir up north, to join Commander Ahmad Shah Massoud's forces and fight the jihad. Laila hardly remembered anything at all about them. A shiny ALLAH pendant around Ahmad's neck. A patch of black hairs on one of Noor's ears. And that was it.</div>

In the darkness, the room had a layered smell about it: sleep, unwashed linen, sweat, dirty socks, perfume, the previous night's leftover qurma.

<div class="line_en">Beneath Mammy's bed, Laila could see the corner of Ahmad's shoe box protruding. From time to time, Mammy showed her the old, crumpled newspaper clippings in it, and pamphlets that Ahmad had managed to collect from insurgent groups and resistance organizations headquartered in Pakistan. One photo, Laila remembered, showed a man in a long white coat handing a lollipop to a legless little boy. The caption below the photo read: Children are the intended victims of Soviet land mine campaign. The article went on to say that the Soviets also liked to hide explosives inside brightly colored toys. If a child picked it up, the toy exploded, tore off fingers or an entire hand. The father could not join the jihad then; he'd have to stay home and care for his child. In another article in Ahmad's box, a young Mujahid was saying that the Soviets had dropped gas on his village that burned people's skin and blinded them. He said he had seen his mother and sister running for the stream, coughing up blood.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在妈妈的床底，莱拉看到艾哈迈德的鞋盒伸出来一角。妈妈一次又一次地给她看鞋盒里面那张皱巴巴的剪报，还有几本艾哈迈德设法从那些总部设在巴基斯坦的起义团体和抵抗组织搜集来的宣传小册子。莱拉记得在一张照片中，一个穿着白色长袍的人正在把一根棒棒糖递给一个没有双腿的小男孩。照片下面的标题是：苏联地雷战故意残害儿童。那篇报道说，苏联人还喜欢将炸药藏在颜色鲜艳的玩具里面。如果孩子捡起这样的玩具，它就会爆炸，炸掉小孩的手指或者一整只手。这样一来，这个孩子的父亲就没办法投身圣战了：他只得留在家里，照顾他的孩子。在艾哈迈德的盒子里面另外一篇文章中，有个参加圣战的年轻人说，苏联人在他家所在的村落投放了毒气弹，灼伤当地人的皮肤，使他们变成瞎子。他说他看到他的母亲和妹妹向溪流跑去，边跑边咳出血来。">查看中文翻译</div>
