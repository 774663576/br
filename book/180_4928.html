<div class="line_en">"Perhaps you will wake up and find the sun shining and the birds singing," she said compassionately, smoothing the little boy's hair, for her husband, with his caustic saying that it would not be fine, had dashed his spirits she could see. This going to the Lighthouse was a passion of his, she saw, and then, as if her husband had not said enough, with his caustic saying that it would not be fine tomorrow, this odious little man went and rubbed it in all over again.</div>

<div class="line_en">All she could do now was to admire the refrigerator, and turn the pages of the Stores list in the hope that she might come upon something like a rake, or a mowing-machine, which, with its prongs and its handles, would need the greatest skill and care in cutting out. All these young men parodied her husband, she reflected; he said it would rain; they said it would be a positive tornado.</div>

<div class="line_en">But here, as she turned the page, suddenly her search for the picture of a rake or a mowing-machine was interrupted. The gruff murmur, irregularly broken by the taking out of pipes and the putting in of pipes which had kept on assuring her, though she could not hear what was said (as she sat in the window which opened on the terrace), that the men were happily talking; this sound, which had lasted now half an hour and had taken its place soothingly in the scale of sounds pressing on top of her, such as the tap of balls upon bats, the sharp, sudden bark now and then, "How's that? How's that?" of the children playing cricket, had ceased; so that the monotonous fall of the waves on the beach, which for the most part beat a measured and soothing tattoo to her thoughts and seemed consolingly to repeat over and over again as she sat with the children the words of some old cradle song, murmured by nature, "I am guarding you -- I am your support," but at other times suddenly and unexpectedly, especially when her mind raised itself slightly from the task actually in hand, had no such kindly meaning, but like a ghostly roll of drums remorselessly beat the measure of life, made one think of the destruction of the island and its engulfment in the sea, and warned her whose day had slipped past in one quick doing after another that it was all ephermal as a rainbow -- this sound which had been obscured and concealed under the other sounds suddenly thundered hollow in her ears and made her look up with an impulse of terror.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是，她正在这里翻动着目录页、寻找耙地机或割草机时，她的搜寻却突然被打断了。她一直能听得见的、时不时因为把烟斗从嘴里拿出放进而被打断的粗哑的低语声，虽然听不清说的是什么（因为她坐在窗户的里侧），却使她放心地知道男人们正在高兴地聊天；这低语声已经继续了半个小时了，是在包围她的种种声音中——如球扣击球声、玩板球的孩子们时而突然发出的尖叫声：“怎么啦？怎么啦？”——使她心安的声音。但是现在却停了下来。海浪单调地拍打着海滩的声音在大部分时间里都是给她的思绪打着有节奏的、使她感到平静的拍子，仿佛当她和孩子们坐在一起的时候、它一遍又一遍地、抚慰地、以大自然的喃喃低语重复着某个古老的摇篮曲中的词句，‘我在守护着你——我是你的支柱”，但是也有一些时候，特别是当她的思想稍稍脱离手头正在做着的事情时，海浪的声音突然出乎意料地没有了这样的亲切含义，而是如一阵神鬼敲起的隆隆鼓声，无情地敲击起生命的节拍，使人想到这个岛的毁灭和被大海吞没，而且在警告她，岁月在她匆忙地做着一件又一件事情时悄悄消逝、一切如彩虹股稍纵即逝——这原来被其他声音掩盖而变得模糊的海浪声突然在她耳际发出沉重的轰鸣，吓得她不由自主地拾起头来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They had ceased to talk; that was the explanation. Falling in one second from the tension which had gripped her to the other extreme which, as if to recoup her for her unnecessary expense of emotion, was cool, amused, and even faintly malicious, she concluded that poor Charles Tansley had been shed. That was of little account to her. If her husband required sacrifices (and indeed he did) she cheerfully offered up to him Charles Tansley, who had snubbed her little boy.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们停止谈话了，这就是原因。顷刻之间她摆脱了紧紧攫住自己的紧张状态，好像为补偿她不必要的感情消耗，她走进了另一个极端，冷静、觉得一切很有趣、甚至还有点幸灾乐祸，她得出的结论是，可怜的查尔斯·坦斯利被甩掉了，她根本不觉得这有什么要紧。如果她的丈夫需要牺牲品的话（他确实是需要），她高兴地给他献上查尔斯·坦斯利，他刚才给她的小儿子泼了冷水。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One moment more, with her head raised, she listened, as if she waited for some habitual sound, some regular mechanical sound; and then, hearing something rhythmical, half said, half chanted, beginning in the garden, as her husband beat up and down the terrace, something between a croak and a song, she was soothed once more, assured again that all was well, and looking down at the book on her knee found the picture of a pocket knife with six blades which could only be cut out if James was very careful.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她抬着头，又倾听了片刻，仿佛在等待某个习惯了的声音，某个有规律的、机械的声音；然后听到了从花园里开始传来的有节奏的半是说话半是吟诵的声音，她丈夫在平台上踱来踱去，发出的声音介于嘟囔和唱歌之间，她再度安下心来，确信一切重又正常，便低下头去看着膝上那本商品目录，找到了一幅带六个刀片的折刀的图，詹姆斯只有非常小心才能剪得下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Suddenly a loud cry, as of a sleep-walker, half roused, something about Stormed at with shot and shell sung out with the utmost intensity in her ear, made her turn apprehensively to see if anyone had heard him. Only Lily Briscoe, she was glad to find; and that did not matter. But the sight of the girl standing on the edge of the lawn painting reminded her; she was supposed to be keeping her head as much in the same position as possible for Lily's picture. Lily's picture! Mrs Ramsay smiled. With her little Chinese eyes and her puckered-up face, she would never marry; one could not take her painting very seriously; she was an independent little creature, and Mrs Ramsay liked her for it; so, remembering her promise, she bent her head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然一声大叫，仿佛是一个半睡半醒的梦游人在喊着什么“冒着枪林弹雨”之类的声音强烈地冲进她的耳朵，使她忧心忡忡地转身环顾四周，看看有没有人听见他的叫喊。她高兴地看到只有莉莉·布里斯柯在场，这就不要紧了。但是看见这个姑娘站在草坪的边上画画使她记起，她应该尽量保持她的头部姿势不变，好让莉莉画她。莉莉的画！拉姆齐夫人笑了。有一双中国人的小眼睛和一张皱巴巴的脸，她永远嫁不了人了；你也不能把她画画这事太当真；但她是个很有独立性的小家伙，为此拉姆齐夫人喜欢她；于是她记起了答应过的话，把头低了下去。">查看中文翻译</div>
