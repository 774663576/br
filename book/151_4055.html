<div class="line_en">Once in a while I'd look to see where she was sitting in the lunchroom, or check the elective lists to see what she'd signed up for. But except for a few nods in the hallway and an occasional "hello," we never really spoke to each other.</div>

<div class="line_en">I hardly saw Via at school this year, and when I did it was awkward. It felt like she was judging me. I knew she didn't like my new look. I knew she didn't like my group of friends. I didn't much like hers. We never actually argued: we just drifted away. Ella and I badmouthed her to each other: She's such a prude, she's so this, she's so that. We knew we were being mean, but it was easier to ice her out if we pretended she had done something to us. The truth is she hadn't changed at all: we had. We'd become these other people, and she was still the person she'd always been. That annoyed me so much and I didn't know why.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这一年我很少见到维娅，即使见到了也很尴尬。我感觉她总是在评判我。我知道她不喜欢我的新形象。我还知道她不喜欢我的这帮朋友。我也不喜欢她的那些朋友。实际上我们从来没争吵过，只是渐渐疏远了。艾拉和我互相说她坏话：她是个故作正经的女人，她这样，她那样。我们知道自己的刻薄，但是假装她做了什么对不起我们的事，这样不睬她才更容易。事实上，她丝毫没变，但我们变了。我们变得跟别人一样，而她却一如既往。不知道为什么，这让我非常恼火。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I noticed Justin about halfway through the school year. I hadn't noticed him at all before then, other than that he was this skinny cutish dude with thick glasses and longish hair who carried a violin everywhere. Then one day I saw him in front of the school with his arm around Via. "So Via has a boyfriend!" I said to Ella, kind of mocking. I don't know why it surprised me that she'd have a boyfriend. Out of the three of us, she was totally the prettiest: blue, blue eyes and long wavy dark hair. But she'd just never acted like she was at all interested in boys. She acted like she was too smart for that kind of stuff.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大概过了一学期我才注意到贾斯汀。我之前根本没把他放在眼里，只知道他是个瘦瘦的家伙，戴着厚厚的眼镜，留一头长发，一把小提琴不离身。后来有一天，我在学校门口看见他搂着维娅。“维娅有男朋友了！”我冷嘲热讽地对艾拉说。不知道为什么，她交男朋友让我很吃惊。在我们三个人中，她绝对是最漂亮的：深蓝色的眼睛，一头乌黑的长鬈发。但是她举手投足间好像从来就没有对男孩有过兴趣。她表现得太聪明了，不至于对这种事情上心。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I had a boyfriend, too: a guy named Zack. When I told him I was choosing the theater elective, he shook his head and said: "Careful you don't turn into a drama geek." Not the most sympathetic dude in the world, but very cute. Very high up on the totem pole. A varsity jock.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我也有男朋友，一个叫扎克的男孩。当我告诉他我要选修戏剧课时，他摇摇头说：“当心别变成演戏狂。”他不是世界上最有同情心的家伙，但是非常可爱。他是学校图腾柱上的佼佼者，大学代表队的运动员。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I wasn't planning on taking theater at first. Then I saw Via's name on the sign-up sheet and just wrote my name down on the list. I don't even know why. We managed to avoid one another throughout most of the semester, like we didn't even know each other. Then one day I got to theater class a little early, and Davenport asked me to run off additional copies of the play he was planning on having us do for the spring production: The Elephant Man. I'd heard about it but I didn't really know what it was about, so I started skimming through the pages while I was waiting for the xerox machine. It was about a man who lived more than a hundred years ago named John Merrick who was terribly deformed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一开始我并没有打算参与演戏。后来我看到报名单上有维娅的名字，于是也神差鬼使地把自己的名字写了上去。这个学期的大部分时间我们都在设法避开对方，好像压根儿不认识彼此。然后有一天，上戏剧课的时候我到得早了点，达文波特叫我去多复印几份剧本，这是他打算让我们排练的春演作品：《象人》。我听说过这部戏，但并不知道它讲的是什么，便在等复印机的时候浏览了一遍。原来是一百多年前一个叫约翰·梅里克的重症畸形人的故事。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We can't do this play, Mr. D," I told him when I got back to class, and I told him why: my little brother has a birth defect and has a deformed face and this play would hit too close to home. He seemed annoyed and a little unsympathetic, but I kind of said that my parents would have a real issue with the school doing this play. So anyway, he ended up switching to Our Town.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们不能演这部戏，D先生。”我回到教室时对他说，并告诉他事出有因：我的弟弟有先天缺陷，脸部畸形，这部戏可能过分了一点。他看起来有点恼火，也有点不近人情，但我说我父母对学校演这种戏也会很有意见。总之，他最后换成了《我们的小镇》。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I think I went for the role of Emily Gibbs because I knew Via was going to go for it, too. It never occurred to me that I'd beat her for the role.</div>
