<div class="line_en">"So after you realized the ship had hit something underwater, your captain ordered you to go and see if there was any damage?" asked one of the sea captains.</div>

<div class="line_en">A month or so later, at the official inquiry, Jim was asked what had happened to the Patna. Trying to describe the experience honestly, he replied, "The ship went over whatever it was as easily as oil running over a stick."</div>

<div class="line_en">The inquiry was held in the crowded police court of an Eastern port. Jim stood there, in front of them all, while many eyes looked at him out of dark, white, and red faces, like staring shadows. They saw a large, good-looking young man, with a straight back and unhappy eyes. The three judges, two of whom were sea captains, sat together under a large window. They asked Jim clear questions, which he answered truthfully. Outside, the sun was beating down, and the air was heavy in the courtroom. Jim's voice seemed very loud to him; it was the only sound in the world. The painful questions they asked him appeared to come from inside him, like the questioning of his conscience.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="审讯是在一个东方港口拥挤的治安法庭进行的。吉姆面对大家站在那儿，许多双眼睛看着他，有黑人，有白人，还有当地人，都像幽灵一样盯着他。他们看到的是一个身材魁梧、相貌英俊、腰杆笔直、眼神忧郁的年轻人。三个法官坐在一扇大窗户下，其中有两人是船长。他们清楚地提问，吉姆都如实作答。屋外的太阳火辣辣的，屋子里很沉闷。吉姆觉得自己的声音特别大，仿佛是世界上唯一的声响。法官的问题让他痛苦，它们好像来自他的内心，在审问他的良知。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes," said Jim. "I discovered a big hole in the metal wall of the ship, below the water. I didn't think of danger just then. I was surprised, because it had happened so quickly. I was on my way back to tell the captain, when I met the second engineer. He had broken his left arm when he was thrown forward earlier. When I told him about the damage, he cried, 'My God! The whole ship will be full of water in a minute!' He pushed me away with his right arm and ran up on to the bridge, shouting as he went. I followed him, and was in time to see the captain hit him. The captain ordered him to keep quiet and go and stop the engines."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，”吉姆说，“我发现船的金属壁破了一个大洞，在水面下。那时我想到的不是危险。我太吃惊了，因为事情发生得太快。我正要回去报告船长时，遇见了大管轮。他刚才摔倒的时候把左胳膊摔断了。我告诉了他船的破损情况，他喊道：‘上帝啊！整艘船马上就会灌满水！’他用右臂将我推开，边喊边冲上舰桥。我跟在他后面，刚好撞见船长打了他一拳。船长命令他不要出声，去把发动机关掉。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jim hoped that if he described everything exactly, and gave all the facts, the people in the courtroom would understand the full horror of it. Every small detail of what had happened was important. Fortunately he remembered it all very clearly. There was something else as well, something unseen and evil, that had helped to cause the disaster. He wished to make that clear. He wanted to go on talking, to find out the truth. But although he spoke calmly and carefully, he felt like a trapped animal, desperately searching for a way out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吉姆希望准确地描述每件事情，把一切都和盘托出，就能让法庭上的人清楚地体会到船上的恐慌。每个小细节都至关重要。还好，这些他都记得很清楚。但还有某种别的因素，某种看不见的罪恶的东西，促使了这场灾难的发生。他希望把这一点说清楚。他想继续说下去，找出真相。他平静而仔细地述说着，但尽管这样，他仍感觉自己像一只掉进陷阱的动物，绝望地寻找着出路。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The questioning continued. Jim was beginning to feel very tired. His mouth was tastelessly dry, and his head felt hot, while the rest of his body was cold. While he waited for the next question, his eyes rested on a white man sitting by himself. He had a worn, clouded face, with clear, quiet eyes. Jim answered another question, and wanted to cry out, "Is it worth going on? Is it really worth it?" He met the eyes of the white man, who was looking at him differently from all the others in the courtroom. It was an honest, intelligent look. Telling the truth was not enough, thought Jim; words were no good to him any longer. And that man appeared to understand his hopeless difficulty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="问讯还在继续。吉姆累了。他嘴巴发干，头也有点儿热，但身体的其他部分却感觉冷。他在等待下一个问题时，眼神落在一个独自坐着的白人身上。那人脸色憔悴、阴沉，但眼睛是明亮而平静的。吉姆又回答完一个问题，他真想大喊：“还值得问下去吗？真的值得吗？”他与那个白人的眼神相遇了。那人正看着他，但与法庭中其他的人不同，这人的目光充满诚实与智慧。吉姆明白，把事实说出来也无济于事；言语对他已经没有用了。这个白人似乎体会到了他的无助。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That stranger with the clear, quiet eyes was Marlow. And later on, in distant parts of the world, Marlow often remembered Jim, and talked about him. It was usually after dinner in a friend's house, when men sat comfortably in their armchairs on the veranda and smoked their cigars, that Marlow was asked to talk. In the darkness, as he sat surrounded by sweet-smelling flowers and a group of listening men, every detail of that fresh young face and straight figure came back to Marlow. He could almost imagine himself back in the past, and he often began with a warning to his listeners.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="眼睛明亮而平静的陌生人名叫马洛。在后来的日子里，马洛常常会在远方记起、谈起吉姆，通常是在朋友家吃完饭，大家惬意地坐在阳台的扶手椅上抽雪茄的时候，会有人要求马洛说说吉姆。在黑暗中，马洛在芬芳的花朵和围坐的听众中间仿佛又看到了那年轻的脸庞和笔直的身形，每个细节都清清楚楚。他几乎以为自己又回到了过去。在讲述之前他往往会给听众一个忠告。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">My friends, It's easy enough to talk about young Jim, but don't be too quick to judge him. A good dinner, an excellent cigar, and a beautiful evening of freshness and starlight like this make us forget how difficult life can be. We all try to do what is right, but the best of us can take the wrong route occasionally. Yes, I was at the official inquiry, and saw Jim there, but I had seen him before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我的朋友们，谈论年轻的吉姆很容易，但不要急于去评判他。一顿可口的晚餐，一支上品雪茄，一个有着清新空气和闪闪星光的美好夜晚，就像今晚一样，会让我们忘记生活的艰辛。我们都尽力去做正确的事，但我们中最优秀的人也会偶尔误入歧途。的确，我出席了那次审讯，在那儿看见了吉姆，但我以前已经见过他了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The first news we had of the Patna was a mysterious message from Aden, that a damaged ship full of pilgrims had been found without its officers, in the Indian Ocean. The whole waterfront -- boatmen, natives, officials, clerks -- talked of nothing else for two weeks. Then, one fine morning, I was standing near the port office, when I saw four men walking towards me, and suddenly realized that they must be the missing officers from the Patna. I recognized the captain, a fat, ugly German, who was well known in all the Eastern ports as a an irresponsible and dishonest seaman. Behind him was the chief engineer, a tall, thin man, and the second engineer, with a broken arm. The fourth was a young man with fair hair and square shoulders, who stood with his hands in his pockets, turning his back on the others. This was my first view of Jim, and I was strangely interested in him, because he looked so clean-faced, so strong, so brave. I felt almost angry. If a man who looks like that can go wrong, I thought, who can you trust?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们得到的有关帕特纳号的最初信息来自亚丁，那神秘的消息说，一艘满载朝圣者的破损船只在印度洋被发现，船上没有船员。两周以来，码头区的所有人——船夫、当地人、官员和职员全在谈论此事。接着，一个晴朗的早晨，我正站在港口办公室附近，看见四个人向我走来，突然意识到他们正是帕特纳号上失踪的船员。我认出了那个船长，那个难看的德国胖子，他的不负责任和不诚实在东方的所有港口是出了名的。他身后跟着又高又瘦的轮机长和断了一只胳膊的大管轮。第四个人是一个肩膀宽厚的金发青年，他双手插在口袋里，背对其他人站着。这是我第一次见到吉姆。我莫名地对他很感兴趣，因为他面容清秀，看起来强壮而勇敢。我几乎有些愤怒。如果这样的人也能犯错误，还有谁能信得过呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I looked over at the young man again, wanting to see him angry, unhappy, ashamed. But he looked completely unworried, and I couldn't understand it. I liked the look of him; he appeared to be that good, honest kind of man who is not interested in ideas, but who does his work well and lives his life bravely to the end. I've had my own ship for a long time now, and I've trained enough young sailors in my time to be able to judge whether you can trust a man or not. It worried me that perhaps I had made a mistake with Jim. Was there something missing in his character? What had made him act like that?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我再次打量那个年轻人，以为会看到他的愤怒、悲伤与羞愧。但他看上去镇定自若，让我无法理解。我喜欢他的样子；他看上去善良而诚实，是个没有什么想法，但却会努力工作，勇敢地活到最后的人。那时，我拥有自己的船已有些时日了，我训练过很多年轻船员，因此能判断出一个人是否可以信赖。我担心自己对吉姆的判断也许有误。他的性格中会不会缺少了某些东西？是什么让他做出这样的举动？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Captain Elliott was the chief port official in those days, and as soon as he realized the captain of the Patna had arrived, he sent for him. Elliott believed strongly in duty and responsibility, and didn't mind who he shouted at. Through the open windows of his office we all heard what he thought of the Patna's captain, and in a very few moments the fat man came running angrily out of Elliott's office. He saw me looking at him, and said, "That crazy Englishman in there called me a dog!" I smiled. "Dog" was the politest word that had reached me. "But I don't care!" he continued, his face purple with anger. "The Pacific is big, my friend. If you English take away my master's certificate, if you won't let me command a ship here, I'll go to -- to Apia, to Honolulu -- they know me there!" I could easily imagine what kind of people knew him there.</div>

<div class="line_en">At the official inquiry, which took place a week later, and lasted three days, Jim was the only one who was questioned. The captain had escaped, and both the engineers were in hospital. The one with the broken arm had a bad fever, and the chief engineer had been drinking brandy for three days and could no longer talk sensibly. In my opinion, the only truth worth knowing was not how, but why, the officers had left the ship, and I realized the inquiry would not discover this. Judges are not paid to look into a man's soul, but only to see the results of his actions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一星期后，为期三天的审讯开始了，但接受问讯的只有吉姆一人。船长逃跑了，两个轮机员都在医院里。胳膊断了的那个发起了高烧，而轮机长则喝了三天白兰地，根本不能清醒地说话。在我看来，唯一值得了解的事实不是船员怎样离开了船，而是他们为什么离开；而我也知道，审讯是查不出真相的。法官的工作不是去探察人的灵魂，而只是看他行动的结果。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The two engineers were now standing in front of their captain, but he turned away from them and hurried over to a horse and trap. He climbed in, shouted impatiently at the driver, and before anyone could do anything to stop him, the horse and trap disappeared in a cloud of dust. Where did he go? To Apia, or Honolulu? Nobody ever saw him again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两个轮机员现在就站在船长前面，但是船长走开了，匆忙奔向一辆轻便马车。他爬进去，不耐烦地叫车夫出发，在人们能够阻止他之前，马车已经绝尘而去。他去了哪里，阿皮亚还是檀香山？从此再没有人见过他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One of the inquiry officials was Captain Brierly, known in all the Eastern ports as a brave officer and an excellent seaman. Young, healthy and successful, he seemed to be one of those lucky men who never make a mistake, and who therefore have a high opinion of themselves. We all thought nothing could touch him or his self-confidence. But we were wrong, because he killed himself a week after the inquiry. I think now that while the other two judges were questioning Jim, Brierly was holding his own silent inquiry, questioning himself. I think his conscience was accusing him of -- who knows what? It wasn't anything to do with money, or drink, or women. But at the end of it, he found himself guilty, and drowned himself, leaving letters for his chief mate and the ship's owners.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布赖尔利船长是法官之一，他既是个勇敢的高级船员，也是个出色的水手，在东方所有的海港都赫赫有名。他年轻、健康、成功，似乎是那些从不犯错的幸运儿之一，因此也很有些自以为是。我们都认为什么都无法触动他和他的自信。但是我们错了，因为在审讯后一个星期他就自杀了。现在想起来，我觉得当其他两个法官审问吉姆的时候，布赖尔利正在默默地审问他自己。我想是他的良心让他受到了谴责——谁知道呢？这与钱、酒和女人都无关。但最后他发现自己有罪，所以自溺而死，给他的大副和船主留了几封信。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"We should put an end to this now," Brierly continued. "This kind of thing destroys people's confidence in us seamen. I'll give you some money, Marlow, and you talk to him. Tell him to leave. Give him another chance. People will forget about it very soon, and he can get on with his life. Of course I can't suggest this to him myself, but you could."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们应该结束这件事，”布赖尔利接着说，“这种事会摧毁人们对咱们水手的信任。我给你一些钱，马洛，你去和他谈谈，让他离开，再给他一次机会。人们会很快忘记这件事的，他可以继续他的生活。当然，我不能亲自去告诉他这样做，但是你 能。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And so I saw, just for a moment, the real Brierly. Naturally I refused to do what he wanted, because I didn't like the way he expected me to arrange Jim's escape, and because I thought it was brave of Jim to accept the blame. I certainly did not realize how important it was to Brierly, who was perhaps remembering some mistake in his own past.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就这样，我在片刻间看到了真实的布赖尔利。我自然拒绝了他的要求，因为我不喜欢他让我 去安排吉姆逃跑，再者我也认为吉姆能承担责任很勇敢。当然，我没有意识到这件事对布赖尔利多么重要，他或许想起了自己过去犯下的错误。">查看中文翻译</div>
