<div class="line_en">Then Mary knew Dickon had meant the picture to be a message. He had meant that she might be sure he would keep her secret. Her garden was her nest and she was like a missel thrush. Oh, how she did like that queer, common boy!</div>

<div class="line_en">But you never know what the weather will do in Yorkshire, particularly in the springtime.

<div class="line_en">She had been lying awake turning from side to side for about an hour, when suddenly something made her sit up in bed and turn her head toward the door listening. She listened and she listened.</div>

<div class="line_en">She threw herself back on her pillow and buried her face. She did not cry, but she lay and hated the sound of the heavily beating rain, she hated the wind and its "wuthering." She could not go to sleep again. The mournful sound kept her awake because she felt mournful herself If she had felt happy it would probably have lulled her to sleep. How it "wuthered" and how the big raindrops poured down and beat against the pane!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她栽回枕头上，埋着脸。她没有哭，而是躺着恨重重击下的雨声，她恨风，恨风的“呜啸”声。她再也睡不着。丧气的声音让她醒着，因为她自己觉得丧气。如果她觉得高兴，风雨声很可能已安抚她入睡。风“呜啸”得啊，大雨点泼得，击打着窗玻璃啊！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The door of her room was ajar and the sound came down the corridor, a far-off faint sound of fretful crying. She listened for a few minutes and each minute she became more and more sure. She felt as if she must find out what it was. It seemed even stranger than the secret garden and the buried key. Perhaps the fact that she was in a rebellious mood made her bold. She put her foot out of bed and stood on the floor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她房间的门稍微开着一点，声音从走廊那头传来，一种遥远模糊的焦躁哭声。她听了几分钟，一刻比一刻肯定。她感到必须找出那是什么。这似乎比秘密花园和掩埋的钥匙更加奇怪。也许其实是造反的情绪让她大胆。她脚离开床，站在地上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It sounds just like a person lost on the moor and wandering on and on crying," she said.</div>

<div class="line_en">She pushed it open very gently and closed it behind her, and she stood in the corridor and could hear the crying quite plainly, though it was not loud. It was on the other side of the wall at her left and a few yards farther on there was a door. She could see a glimmer of light coming from beneath it. The Someone was crying in that room, and it was quite a young Someone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她轻轻推开门，在身后关上，她站在走廊里，哭声听得明明白白，尽管不响亮。声音在左边的墙那一侧，再走几码有道门。她能看到门下微微透出光。那人在那个房间里哭着，是个相当年轻的人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a candle by her bedside and she took it up and went softly out of the room. The corridor looked very long and dark, but she was too excited to mind that. She thought she remembered the corners she must turn to find the short corridor with the door covered with tapestry -- the one Mrs. Medlock had come through the day she lost herself. The sound had come up that passage. So she went on with her dim light, almost feeling her way, her heart beating so loud that she fancied she could hear it. The far-off faint crying went on and led her. Sometimes it stopped for a moment or so and then began again. Was this the right corner to turn? She stopped and thought. Yes it was. Down this passage and then to the left, and then up two broad steps, and then to the right again. Yes, there was the tapestry door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="床边有一支蜡烛，她拿起来轻轻地走出房间。走廊很长很黑，但是她太兴奋，不顾了。她想她记得在哪个角拐去那个门上盖挂毯的短走廊——她迷路那天，莫得劳克太太出现时穿过的那个走廊。声音是从那个走廊来的。于是她在微光里继续走，几乎是凭感觉找路，她的心跳得很响，她想像自己都能听见了。遥远模糊的哭声持续着，引导着她。有时它停顿一下，又开始。该在这个角拐弯吗？她停下来思考。是，是这个。走到这个走廊尽头，然后左转，然后上两段宽台阶，再右拐。对，挂毯盖着的门。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a big room with ancient, handsome furniture in it. There was a low fire glowing faintly on the hearth and a night light burning by the side of a carved four-posted bed hung with brocade, and on the bed was lying a boy, crying fretfully.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="宽敞的房间里有古老、堂皇的家具。暗火微弱的红光染在火炉前的砖地上，一盏灯点在一架四角带柱、挂着锦缎的雕花床旁边，床上躺着一个男孩，焦躁地哭着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mary stood near the door with her candle in her hand, holding her breath.

<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽手拿蜡烛站在门旁，屏住呼吸。然后她溜过房间，随着她靠近，亮光吸引了男孩的注意，他在枕上扭头瞪着她，灰眼睛睁得那么大，似乎大不可测。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The boy had a sharp, delicate face the color of ivory and he seemed to have eyes too big for it. He had also a lot of hair which tumbled over his forehead in heavy locks and made his thin face seem smaller. He looked like a boy who had been ill, but he was crying more as if he were tired and cross than as if he were in pain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="男孩的脸尖瘦、细致，色如象牙，他的眼睛衬着脸显得太大了。他也有很多头发，大卷大卷跌在额上，让他的瘦脸显得更小了。男孩看上去病了很久，但是他哭似乎更是觉得疲惫别扭，而非疼痛。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He said it as if he was so accustomed to the idea that it had ceased to matter to him at all. He seemed to like the sound of Mary's voice.

But at last he asked a question which opened up a new subject.</div>

And then she told him about the robin and Ben Weatherstaff, and there was so much to tell about the robin and it was so easy and safe to talk about it that she ceased to be afraid. The robin pleased him so much that he smiled until he looked almost beautiful, and at first Mary had thought that he was even plainer than herself, with his big eyes and heavy locks of hair.</div>
