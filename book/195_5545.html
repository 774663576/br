<div class="line_en">Philip woke early next morning, and his first thought was of Mildred. It struck him that he might meet her at Victoria Station and walk with her to the shop. He shaved quickly, scrambled into his clothes, and took a bus to the station. He was there by twenty to eight and watched the incoming trains. Crowds poured out of them, clerks and shop-people at that early hour, and thronged up the platform: they hurried along, sometimes in pairs, here and there a group of girls, but more often alone. They were white, most of them, ugly in the early morning, and they had an abstracted look; the younger ones walked lightly, as though the cement of the platform were pleasant to tread, but the others went as though impelled by a machine: their faces were set in an anxious frown.</div>

People used to stop at the gate and ask who the house belonged to, the roses were so beautiful. Of course it isn't very nice for me having to mix with them girls in the shop, it's not the class of person I've been used to, and sometimes I really think I'll give up business on that account. It's not the work I mind, don't think that; but it's the class of people I have to mix with."</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip bought tickets for Saturday night. It was not one of the days on which she got off early and therefore she would have no time to go home and change; but she meant to bring a frock up with her in the morning and hurry into her clothes at the shop. If the manageress was in a good temper she would let her go at seven. Philip had agreed to wait outside from a quarter past seven onwards. He looked forward to the occasion with painful eagerness, for in the cab on the way from the theatre to the station he thought she would let him kiss her. The vehicle gave every facility for a man to put his arm round a girl's waist (an advantage which the hansom had over the taxi of the present day), and the delight of that was worth the cost of the evening's entertainment.</div>

<div class="line_en">But on Saturday afternoon when he went in to have tea, in order to confirm the arrangements, he met the man with the fair moustache coming out of the shop. He knew by now that he was called Miller. He was a naturalized German, who had anglicised his name, and he had lived many years in England. Philip had heard him speak, and, though his English was fluent and natural, it had not quite the intonation of the native. Philip knew that he was flirting with Mildred, and he was horribly jealous of him; but he took comfort in the coldness of her temperament, which otherwise distressed him; and, thinking her incapable of passion, he looked upon his rival as no better off than himself. But his heart sank now, for his first thought was that Miller's sudden appearance might interfere with the jaunt which he had so looked forward to. He entered, sick with apprehension. The waitress came up to him, took his order for tea, and presently brought it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到了周六下午，菲利普去米尔德里德那里喝茶，顺便确认一下晚上的安排。可他和正从店里往外走、留着漂亮胡子的男人撞了个正着。他现在已经知道了这个男人的两三事：名叫米勒，在英国住了好些年头，早入乡随俗换了英国名字。他曾经听过他说话，尽管一口英语地道流畅，可还是能从发音里听出不是英国本地人。看到他一直和米尔德里德眉来眼去，菲利普嫉妒得眼睛都绿了。不过好在米尔德里德对谁都冷冰冰的——这本是很让他惆怅的事，可再一想，这样缺少激情的个性不也让自己的情敌好受不到哪去吗——此刻他的心不由提了起来，从见到米勒的那一刻起，他就隐隐觉得今晚的约会可能有泡汤的危险了。他忧心忡忡地进了店，米尔德里德走过来给他点了餐，又很快把茶和点心端上来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She quickly wrote out his bill and left him. Philip knew very little about women, or he would have been aware that one should accept their most transparent lies. He made up his mind that he would watch the shop and see for certain whether Mildred went out with the German. He had an unhappy passion for certainty. At seven he stationed himself on the opposite pavement. He looked about for Miller, but did not see him. In ten minutes she came out, she had on the cloak and shawl which she had worn when he took her to the Shaftesbury Theatre. It was obvious that she was not going home. She saw him before he had time to move away, started a little, and then came straight up to him.</div>

<div class="line_en">He nodded and limped away slowly, for he hoped with all his heart that she would call him back. At the next lamp-post he stopped and looked over his shoulder. He thought she might beckon to him -- he was willing to forget everything, he was ready for any humiliation -- but she had turned away, and apparently had ceased to trouble about him. He realised that she was glad to be quit of him.</div>
