But old fools is the biggest fools there is. Can't learn an old dog new tricks, as the saying is. But my goodness, he never plays them alike, two days, and how is a body to know what's coming? He 'pears to know just how long he can torment me before I get my dander up, and he knows if he can make out to put me off for a minute or make me laugh, it's all down again and I can't hit him a lick. I ain't doing my duty by that boy, and that's the Lord's truth, goodness knows. Spare the rod and spile the child, as the Good Book says. I'm a laying up sin and suffering for us both, I know. He's full of the old Scratch, but laws–a–me! he's my own dead sister's boy, poor thing, and I ain't got the heart to lash him, somehow. Every time I let him off, my conscience does hurt me so, and every time I hit him my old heart most breaks. Well–a–well, man that is born of woman is of few days and full of trouble, as the Scripture says, and I reckon it's so. He'll play hookey this evening, * and [* Southwestern for "afternoon"] I'll just be obleeged to make him work, to–morrow, to punish him. It's mighty hard to make him work Saturdays, when all the boys is having holiday, but he hates work more than he hates anything else, and I've got to do some of my duty by him, or I'll be the ruination of the child."</div>

He got back home barely in season to help Jim, the small colored boy, saw next–day's wood and split the kindlings before supper-at least he was there in time to tell his adventures to Jim while Jim did three–fourths of the work.

<div class="line_en">Within two minutes, or even less, he had forgotten all his troubles. Not because his troubles were one whit less heavy and bitter to him than a man's are to a man, but because a new and powerful interest bore them down and drove them out of his mind for the time-just as men's misfortunes are forgotten in the excitement of new enterprises. This new interest was a valued novelty in whistling, which he had just acquired from a negro, and he was suffering to practise it undisturbed. It consisted in a peculiar bird–like turn, a sort of liquid warble, produced by touching the tongue to the roof of the mouth at short intervals in the midst of the music-the reader probably remembers how to do it, if he has ever been a boy. Diligence and attention soon gave him the knack of it, and he strode down the street with his mouth full of harmony and his soul full of gratitude. He felt much as an astronomer feels who has discovered a new planet-no doubt, as far as strong, deep, unalloyed pleasure is concerned, the advantage was with the boy, not the astronomer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不到两分钟，甚至更短，他已将全部烦恼给忘记了。就像大人们的烦恼也是烦恼一样，他忘记烦恼并不是因为他的烦恼对他不怎么沉重和难受，而是因为一种新的、更强烈的兴趣暂时压倒并驱散了他心中的烦闷——就像大人们在新奇感受的兴奋之时，也会暂时忘却自己的不幸一样。这种新产生的兴趣就是一种新的吹口哨方法，它很有价值，是刚从一个黑人那学到的，现在他正要一心练习练习又不想被别人打扰。这声音很特别，像小鸟的叫声，一种流畅而委婉的音调。在吹这个调子的时候，舌头断断续续地抵住口腔的上腭——读者若曾经也是孩子的话，也许还记得该怎样吹这种口哨。汤姆学得很勤奋，练得很专心，很快就掌握了其中要领。于是他沿街大步流星地走着，口中吹着口哨，心里乐滋滋的，那股乐劲如同天文学家发现了新行星时一般，仅就乐的程度之深之强烈而言，此时的汤姆绝对比天文学家还要兴奋。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A new–comer of any age or either sex was an impressive curiosity in the poor little shabby village of St. Petersburg. This boy was well dressed, too-well dressed on a week–day. This was simply astounding. His cap was a dainty thing, his close–buttoned blue cloth roundabout was new and natty, and so were his pantaloons. He had shoes on-and it was only Friday. He even wore a necktie, a bright bit of ribbon. He had a citified air about him that ate into Tom's vitals. The more Tom stared at the splendid marvel, the higher he turned up his nose at his finery and the shabbier and shabbier his own outfit seemed to him to grow. Neither boy spoke. If one moved, the other moved-but only sidewise, in a circle; they kept face to face and eye to eye all the time. Finally Tom said:</div>

<div class="line_en">The new boy took two broad coppers out of his pocket and held them out with derision. Tom struck them to the ground. In an instant both boys were rolling and tumbling in the dirt, gripped together like cats; and for the space of a minute they tugged and tore at each other's hair and clothes, punched and scratched each other's nose, and covered themselves with dust and glory. Presently the confusion took form, and through the fog of battle Tom appeared, seated astride the new boy, and pounding him with his fists. "Holler 'nuff!" said he. The boy only struggled to free himself. He was crying-mainly from rage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="新来的男孩果真从衣服口袋里掏出两个分币，嘲弄地摊开手掌。汤姆一把将钱打翻在地。立刻两个人像两只争食的猫一样，在地上的尘土里滚打，撕扯起来，紧接着又是扯头发，又是揪衣领，拼命地捶打对方的鼻子，抓对方的脸。两个人都弄得浑身是土，却又都威风凛凛。最后谁胜谁败逐渐见了分晓，汤姆从尘土中爬起来，骑在那个男孩的身上，攥紧拳头使劲地打那个男孩。“挨够了吗？求饶吧！”他说。那个男孩只想挣脱出来。他气得嚎啕大哭。">查看中文翻译</div>

Tom chased the traitor home, and thus found out where he lived. He then held a position at the gate for some time, daring the enemy to come outside, but the enemy only made faces at him through the window and declined. At last the enemy's mother appeared, and called Tom a bad, vicious, vulgar child, and ordered him away. So he went away; but he said he "'lowed" to "lay" for that boy.</div>
