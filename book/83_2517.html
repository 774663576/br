<div class="line_en">I didn't go near the Sternwood family. I went back to the office and sat in my swivel chair and tried to catch up on my foot-dangling. There was a gusty wind blowing in at the windows and the soot from the oil burners of the hotel next door was down-drafted into the room and rolling across the top of the desk like tumbleweed drifting across a vacant lot. I was thinking about going out to lunch and that life was pretty flat and that it would probably be just as flat if I took a drink and that taking a drink all alone at that time of day wouldn't be any fun anyway. I was thinking this when Norris called up. In his carefully polite manner he said that General Sternwood was not feeling very well and that certain items in the newspaper had been read to him and he assumed that my investigation was now completed.</div>

<div class="line_en">I counted it up on my fingers. Rusty Regan had run away from a lot of money and a handsome wife to go wandering with a vague blonde who was more or less married to a racketeer named Eddie Mars. He had gone suddenly without good-byes and there might be any number of reasons for that. The General had been too proud, or, at the first interview he gave me, too careful, to tell me the Missing Persons Bureau had the matter in hand. The Missing Persons people were dead on their feet on it and evidently didn't think it worth bothering over. Regan had done what he had done and that was his business. I agreed with Captain Gregory that Eddie Mars would have been very unlikely to involve himself in a double murder just because another man had gone to town with the blonde he was not even living with. It might have annoyed him, but business is business, and you have to hold your teeth clamped around Hollywood to keep from chewing on stray blondes. If there had been a lot of money involved, that would be different. But fifteen grand wouldn't be a lot of money to Eddie Mars. He was no two-bit chiseler like Brody.</div>

They wouldn't need her for that, if Carol took a plea, and if he pleaded guilty on arraignment, they would turn her loose.

<div class="line_en">I got down there about nine, under a hard high October moon that lost itself in the top layers of a beach fog. The Cypress Club was at the far end of the town, a rambling frame mansion that had once been the summer residence of a rich man named De Cazens, and later had been a hotel. It was now a big dark outwardly shabby place in a thick grove of wind-twisted Monterey cypresses, which gave it its name. It had enormous scrolled porches, turrets all over the place, stained-glass trims around the big windows, big empty stables at the back, a general air of nostalgic decay. Eddie Mars had left the outside much as he had found it, instead of making it over to look like an MGM set. I left my car on a street with sputtering arc lights and walked into the grounds along a damp gravel path to the main entrance. A doorman in a double-breasted guard's coat let me into a huge dim silent lobby from which a white oak staircase curved majestically up to the darkness of an upper floor. I checked my hat and coat and waited, listening to music and confused voices behind heavy double doors. They seemed a long way off, and not quite of the same world as the building itself. Then the slim pasty-faced blond man who had been with Eddie Mars and the pug at Geiger's place came through a door under the staircase, smiled at me bleakly and took me back with him along a carpeted hall to the boss's office.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大约九点钟我到了那里，十月的皓月高高悬起，在顶层的海滩雾气里不见踪迹。柏树俱乐部在镇子的另一头，那幢大而无当的宅第原本是一个名叫德·卡岑斯避暑的居所，后来做过酒店。如今那是幢黑色的大房子，外观破破烂烂，掩映在茂密的辐射柏树丛中，它的名字便是这么来的。我看到带涡卷雕塑的巨型廊柱，分布各处的角楼，宽大窗户旁装饰着彩色玻璃，房子后面空荡荡的大马厩，整个地方弥漫着一股怀旧的败落气息。艾迪·马尔斯保持了大宅的原样，没有把它翻新成米高梅的摄影场地。路边的弧光灯喷洒似的照射到路面上，我把车一停，沿着一条通往大门的石子路走进庭院里。一个身穿双排扣制服的门卫把我领进一间昏暗寂静的大厅，一截楼梯由此向上，跨出高贵的弧度，通向漆黑的二楼。我寄放好帽子和外套，静静等待，听着笨重的双开门后面传来的音乐声和混乱的说话声。那些声音似乎离得很远，跟这房子简直不像属于同一个世界。随后，之前跟艾迪·马尔斯和拳击手一起出现在盖革家里的那个面色苍白的金发瘦子从楼梯下面的门里出来了，冲我冷冷一笑，带我顺着过道地毯一路走回他老板的办公室。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This was a square room with a deep old bay window and a stone fireplace in which a fire of juniper logs burned lazily. It was wainscoted in walnut and had a frieze of faded damask above the paneling. The ceiling was high and remote. There was a smell of cold sea.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那是间四四方方的房间，嵌着很深的凸窗，石头砌成的壁炉里一堆杜松木材懒洋洋地燃烧着。炉前的护壁板是胡桃木的，镶板上搭着一条褪色的花缎台布。天花板又高又远。屋里有股冰冷的海水气味。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你很会说话，”他说道，“不过我敢说，你操办起事情来更是要厉害得多。你其实对里根并不感兴趣，对吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He wiped his lips again and looked at the handkerchief almost as if he expected to find blood on it. He drew his thick gray eyebrows close together and fingered the side of his weatherbeaten nose.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他又擦了擦嘴唇，接着看着手帕，仿佛觉得上面会有血似的。他聚拢起两根茂密的灰色眉毛，伸出手指摸了摸那只饱经风霜的鼻子的内侧。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He shrugged impatiently. "I wish to Christ I didn't know half the stuff that's brought to me. Knowing other people's business is the worst investment a man can make in my circle. Then if it was just Geiger you were after, you're washed up on that angle."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他不耐烦地耸耸肩。“每天传来的这些消息，有一半我都巴不得求求老天别让我知道。在我这个圈子里，精力用在最差的地方就是去知道别人的事。如果你要找的只是盖革，那问题已经解决了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">His mouth looked sulky. "They're plain trouble. Take the dark one. She's a pain in the neck around here. If she loses, she plunges and I end up with a fistful of paper which nobody will discount at any price. She has no money of her own except an allowance and what's in the old man's will is a secret.
