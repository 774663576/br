<div class="line_en">I t was a cold, rain-washed afternoon in late August. Lady Blemley and her guests were sitting round the tea table. Everyone was listening open-mouthed to Mr Cornelius Appin.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是8月底一个寒冷的下午。布莱姆雷夫人和客人正坐在桌旁吃茶点。大家听了科尼利厄斯·阿普因先生的话都很吃惊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Although he was one of her guests, Lady Blemley did not know Mr Appin well. She had invited him to stay at Blemley House because she had heard that he was clever. But until teatime that day he had not done or said anything clever. He did not play tennis, or sing, or make intelligent conversation. But now Mr Appin was describing a most extraordinary discovery and the other guests were listening with deep interest. "Are you telling us that you have found a way of teaching animals to talk?" Sir Wilfrid was saying.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然他是其中的一个客人，但是布莱姆雷夫人并不太了解阿普因先生。她只是听说他聪明，所以邀请他来布莱姆雷家。但那天直到喝茶的时候他还没有做或说任何聪明的事情。他没打网球、没唱歌也没说什么机智的话。但是现在阿普因先生正在描述一个极其特别的发现，其他客人正兴致勃勃地听着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I have studied this problem for seventeen years," said Mr Appin, "but I didn't have any real success until eight or nine months ago. Of course, I have studied thousands of animals, but recently I have worked only with cats. A cat, of course, is a wild animal who agrees to live with you. All cats are intelligent, but naturally some cats are more intelligent than others. When I met Tobermory a week ago, I realized at once that here was an extraordinarily intelligent cat, a very special cat indeed. In Tobermory, I found the student I needed. With him I have succeeded in my plan."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我研究这个问题17年了，”阿普因先生说，“但是直到八九个月前我才真正成功了。当然，我研究了成千上万种动物，但是最近我只研究了猫。猫自然是愿意和你生活在一起的野生动物。所有的猫都聪明，但是一些猫自然比其它的更聪明。一星期前遇见托博莫里时，我立刻意识到这是一只极其聪明的猫，一只实际上非常特殊的猫。在托博莫里身上我找到了我需要的学生，借助于他我成功地实现了我的计划。”">查看中文翻译</div>
