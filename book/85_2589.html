<div class="line_cn" title="这就是他看到的情形：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He saw his mother, looking concerned, sitting at the kitchen table. He saw Mickey Shea, sitting across from her. Mickey looked awful. He was soaking wet, and he kept rubbing his hands over his forehead and down his nose. He began to sob. Eddie's mother brought him a glass of water. She motioned for him to wait, and walked to the bedroom and shut the door. She took off her shoes and her house-dress. She reached for a blouse and skirt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他看到了他的母亲，神色忧虑地坐在厨房桌子旁。他看到了米基·希，坐在他母亲的对面。米基看上去糟透了。他浑身透湿，不停地用手摸着前额和鼻子。他哭了起来。爱迪的母亲给他倒来一杯水。她示意他等着。然后，朝卧室走去，关上了门。她脱掉了她的鞋子和家常便服。她伸手去拿衬衫和裙子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ruby pointed with the tip of her parasol and drew a circle in the snow. When Eddie looked into the circle, he felt as if his eyes were falling from their sockets and traveling on their own, down a hole and into another moment. The images sharpened. It was years ago, in the old apartment. He could see front and back, above and below.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="鲁比用她的阳伞尖，在雪地上画了一个圆圈。爱迪朝圆圈里望去，他感到自己的眼睛好像从眼眶里掉了出来，径直地向洞里取去，进入了另一个时刻。图像清晰了。那是多年以前，在那幢老公寓里。公寓的上下前后，一目了然。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Eddie could see all the rooms, but he could not hear what the two of them were saying, it was just blurred noise. He saw Mickey, in the kitchen, ignoring the glass of water, pulling a flask from his jacket and swigging from it. Then, slowly, he got up and staggered to the bedroom. He opened the door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱迪能看到所有的房间，但是，他听不清他们两个在说什么，只是一片模糊的杂音。他看到米基在厨房里，没去碰那杯水，他从自己的夹克衫里拿出一个酒瓶，畅饮几口。然后，慢慢地，他站起身来，东倒西歪地朝卧室走去。他打开了门。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then the front door opened and Eddie's father stood there, wet from rain, a ball peen hammer hanging from his belt. He ran into the bedroom and saw Mickey grabbing his wife. Eddie's father hollered. He raised the hammer. Mickey put his hands over his head and charged to the door, knocking Eddie's father sideways. Eddie's mother was crying, her chest heaving, her face streamed with tears. Her husband grabbed her shoulders. He shook her violently. Her robe fell. They were both screaming. Then Eddie's father left the apartment, smashing a lamp with the hammer on his way out. He thumped down the steps and ran off into the rainy night.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后，前门打开了，爱迪的父亲站在那里，满身雨水，一把圆头锤子挂在腰带上。他跑进卧室，看到米基正搂着他的妻子。爱迪的父亲大吼一声。他举起锤子。米基抱住脑袋，冲到门口，把爱迪的父亲猛撞到一边。爱迪的母亲哭泣着，胸脯一起一伏，满脸泪水。她的丈夫抓住她的肩膀。他拼命地摇晃她。她的睡袍掉到了地上。两人都尖声叫着。然后，爱迪的父亲离开了家，在出去的路上，用锤子把一盏灯给砸烂了。他脚步噔噔地走下楼梯，冲进雨夜里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Eddie saw his mother, half dressed, turn in surprise. Mickey was wobbling. She pulled a robe around her. Mickey came closer. Her hand went out instinctively to block him. Mickey froze, just for an instant, then grabbed that hand and grabbed Eddie's mother and backed her into the wall, leaning against her, grabbing her waist. She squirmed, then yelled, and pushed on Mickey's chest while still gripping her robe. He was bigger and stronger, and he buried his unshaven face below her cheek, smearing tears on her neck.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱迪看到他的母亲，衣服正穿了一半，吃惊地转过身来。米基摇摇摆摆地走过去。她抓了一件睡袍裹在身上。米基走得更近了。她的手下意识地伸出去阻挡他。米基愣了一下，只有一瞬间，然后，他抓住她的那只手，抓住爱迪的母亲，将她推后倚在墙上，身体靠在她的身上，搂住她的腰。她扭动着，然后，大喊起来，一只手推着米基的胸脯。另一只手仍然抓着她的睡袍。他比她高大强壮，他将他没有剃须的脸埋在她的面颊下面，抹了她一脖子的泪水。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The old woman held her tongue. She stepped to the side of the snowy circle and drew another one. Eddie tried not to look down. He couldn't help it. He was falling again, becoming eyes at a scene.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="老妇人缄口不言。她走到雪地上的圆圈旁边，又画了一个圆圈。爱迪不想去看，但又忍不住。他又一次坠落下去，变成一双眼睛，望着一幕场景。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"WHAT WAS THAT?" Eddie yelled in disbelief. "What the hell was THAT?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那是怎么问事？”爱迪疑惑地大叫起来。“那到底是怎么回事？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This is what he saw:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这就是他看到的情景：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Eddie's father appeared moments later, scrambling back and forth, the hammer still in his hand. He grabbed the railing, searching the waters. The wind blew the rain in sideways. His clothes were drenched and his leather tool belt was nearly black from the soaking. He saw something in the waves. He stopped, pulled off the belt, yanked off one shoe, tried to undo the other, gave up, squatted under the railing and jumped, splashing clumsily in the churning ocean.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几分钟之后。爱迪的父亲出现了，身体前后摇晃着匆匆疾行，锤子仍然握在手里。他手抓着栏杆，目光在水面上搜寻着。风吹雨斜。他的衣服被雨淋透了，工具皮带被水浸得几乎变成了黑色。他看到波浪里有什么东西。他停住脚步，拉掉皮带…拔下一只鞋，想去拔另一只，没拔下来，然后在栏杆下蹲下身，跳进了水里，笨拙的身体在汹涌澎湃的海水中溅起一片浪花。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He saw a rainstorm at the farthest edge of Ruby Pier -- the "north point," they called it -- a narrow jetty that stretched far out into the ocean. The sky was a bluish black. The rain was falling in sheets. Mickey Shea came stumbling toward the edge of the jetty. He fell to the ground, his stomach heaving in and out. He lay there for a moment, face to the darkened sky, then rolled on his side, under the wood railing. He dropped into the sea.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他看到了一场暴风雨，在“红宝石码头”最边缘的地方－－北角”，人们这样称呼它－一条狭窄的防浪堤远远地延伸到大海里。天空是一片墨蓝色。大雨滂沱。米基步履蹒跚地朝防浪堤边上走去。他摔倒在地，腹部一起一伏。他就那样躺了一会儿，仰面朝着黑暗的天空，然后，他侧过身来，躺在木头栏杆下面。他跌进了大海。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They caught the crest of a wave and made sudden progress shoreward. Mickey moaned and gasped. Eddie's father spit out seawater. It seemed to take forever, the rain popping, the white foam smacking their faces, the two men grunting, thrashing their arms. Finally, a high, curling wave lifted them up and dumped them onto the sand, and Eddie's father rolled out from under Mickey and was able to hook his hands under Mickey's arms and hold him from being swept into the surf. When the waves receded, he yanked Mickey forward with a final surge, then collapsed on the shore, his mouth open, filling with wet sand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们骑在一个浪峰上。被急速地推向了岸边。米基呻吟着，大口喘着粗气。爱迪的父亲嘴里吐着海水。大雨拍浪，白色的泡沫猛扑到他们的脸上，两个人吭哧吭哧地挥动着双臂，但是好像永远到不了岸边。终于，一个盘旋而来的巨浪将他们抬起，抛到了沙滩上，爱迪的父亲从米基的身体下面滚出来，用两手钩住米基的双臂，不让他再被海浪卷回去。当海浪退去，他使出了最后一次力气将米基拖上了岸，然后，他瘫倒在沙滩上，张着嘴巴，满嘴湿沙子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mickey was bobbing in the insistent roll of seawater, half unconscious, a foamy yellow fluid coming from his mouth. Eddie's father swam to him, yelling into the wind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="米基在咄咄逼人的海浪中沉浮着。几乎不省人事，嘴角溢出一种黄色的泡沫。爱迪的父亲朝他游去，在风中大喊着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He grabbed Mickey. Mickey swung. Eddie's father swung back. The skies clapped with thunder as the rainwater pelted them. They grabbed and flailed in the violent chop.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mickey coughed hard as Eddie's father grabbed his arm and hooked it over his shoulder. He went under, came up again, then braced his weight against Mickey's body, pointing them toward shore. He kicked. They moved forward. A wave swept them back. Then forward again. The ocean thumped and crashed, but Eddie's father remained wedged under Mickey's armpit, pumping his legs, blinking wildly to clear his vision.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="米基猛咳起来，爱迪的父亲抓住他的胳膊，将它钩在自己的肩膀上。他沉到水里，又浮了上来，他用自己的身体支撑着米基的重量，朝岸边转过身来。他用脚踢水。他们向前游去。一个浪头涌过来。将他们推后。他们又向前行。大海汹涌澎湃，但是，爱迪的父亲一直紧紧地将自己卡在来基的腋下，猛蹬双腿，拼命地眨着眼睛想让视线更清楚。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ruby nodded. "Sometime during the night, your father awakened. He rose from his bed, staggered across the room, and found the strength to raise the window sash. He called your mother's name with what little voice he had, and he called yours, too, and your brother, Joe. And he called for Mickey. At that moment, it seemed, his heart was spilling out, all the guilt and regret. Perhaps he felt the light of death approaching. Perhaps he only knew you were all out there somewhere, in the streets beneath his window. He bent over the ledge. The night was chilly. The wind and damp, in his state, were too much. He was dead before dawn.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="鲁比点点头。“半夜里。你父亲醒了过来。他从床上站起来，蹒跚地穿过房间，然后，用不知从哪里来的力气把窗户拉了起来。他用他那微弱的声音呼唤着你母亲的名字，你的名字，你哥哥乔的名字。他还呼唤着米基。一时间，他好像有满腹衷肠要倾诉，所有的悔恨和内疚。也许，他感到了死亡之光的降临。也许，他只知道你们都在外面的什么地方，在窗户下面的街道里。他趴在窗沿上。夜很冷。以他这种状态，他根本受不住这寒风和湿气。天亮之前，他就死掉了。">查看中文翻译</div>
