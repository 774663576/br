<div class="line_en">She remained with her comrades till dusk, and participated with a certain zest in the dancing; though, being heart-whole as yet, she enjoyed treading a measure purely for its own sake; little divining when she saw 'the soft torments, the bitter sweets, the pleasing pains, and the agreeable distresses' of those girls who had been wooed and won, what she herself was capable of in that kind. The struggles and wrangles of the lads for her hand in a jig were an amusement to her -- no more; and when they became fierce she rebuked them.</div>

<div class="line_en">As for Tess Durbeyfield, she did not so easily dislodge the incident from her consideration. She had no spirit to dance again for a long time, though she might have had plenty of partners; but, ah! they did not speak so nicely as the strange young man had done. It was not till the rays of the sun had absorbed the young stranger's retreating figure on the hill that she shook off her temporary sadness and answered her would-be partner in the affirmative.</div>

<div class="line_en">While yet many score yards off, other rhythmic sounds than those she had quitted became audible to her; sounds that she knew well -- so well. They were a regular series of thumpings from the interior of the house, occasioned by the violent rocking of a cradle upon a stone floor, to which movement a feminine voice kept time by singing, in a vigorous gallopade, the favourite ditty of 'The Spotted Cow' --</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当她走到离家几十码的地方，她听见了另外一种跟她刚刚离开的舞场上的节奏声不同的节奏声；那是她熟悉的声音——非常熟悉的声音。它们是从屋里面传出来的一连串有规律的砰砰声，原来是摇篮的猛烈摇动碰撞石头地面而发出的声音。随着摇篮的摇动，一个女声正用一种快速舞曲的一节奏唱。一首流行小调《花斑母牛》：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After this invocation the rocking and the singing would recommence, and the 'Spotted Cow' proceed as before. So matters stood when Tess opened the door, and paused upon the mat within it surveying the scene.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这阵祈祷过后，摇篮的摇动和歌唱又开始了，《花斑母牛》这首小调也像先前一样唱起来。苔丝推开门，站在垫子上观察到的情景是这样的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The cradle-rocking and the song would cease simultaneously for a moment, and an exclamation at highest vocal pitch would take the place of the melody.</div>

<div class="line_en">The interior, in spite of the melody, struck upon the girl's senses with an unspeakable dreariness. From the holiday gaieties of the field -- the white gowns, the nosegays, the willow-wands, the whirling movements on the green, the flash of gentle sentiment towards the stranger -- to the yellow melancholy of this one-candled spectacle, what a step! Besides the jar of contrast there came to her a chill self-reproach that she had not returned sooner, to help her mother in these domesticities, instead of indulging herself out-of-doors.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="屋内尽管有唱歌的声音，但是苔丝却感到有一种说不出的凄凉。从田野里节日的欢乐——白色的长袍，一束束鲜花，垂柳的枝条，草地上旋转的舞步，对陌生人生出来的柔情——到一支蜡烛的昏黄暗淡的景象，这是多么巨大的差异啊！除了对比之下引起的不愉快而外，她在心里头还产生了一阵严厉的自我责备，怪自己没有早点回来帮助母亲做些家务事情，而一直在外面贪恋玩乐。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Nick-knock, nick-knock, went the cradle; the candle-flame stretched itself tall, and began jigging up and down; the water dribbled from the matron's elbows, and the song galloped on to the end of the verse, Mrs Durbeyfield regarding her daughter the while. Even now, when burdened with a young family, Joan Durbeyfield was a passionate lover of tune. No ditty floated into Blackmoor Vale from the outer world but Tess's mother caught up its notation in a week.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="摇篮砰吱砰吱地摇着；烛焰伸长了，开始上下摇曳起来；德北菲尔德太太仔细注视着她的女儿，洗衣水从她的胳膊肘上流下来，《花斑母牛》也很快唱到了一段的末尾。甚至现在，琼·德北菲尔德太太身上压着一群孩子的重担，她也十分喜欢唱歌。只要有小调从外面的世界传入黑荒原谷，苔丝的母亲就能在一星期里学会它的曲子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There stood her mother amid the group of children, as Tess had left her, hanging over the Monday washing-tub, which had now, as always, lingered on to the end of the week. Out of that tub had come the day before -- Tess felt it with a dreadful sting of remorse -- the very white frock upon her back which she had so carelessly greened about the skirt on the damping grass -- which had been wrung up and ironed by her mother's own hands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的母亲站在一群孩子中间，同苔丝离开她时一样，正在洗一盆星期一就该洗的衣服，这盆衣服现在同往常一样，一直拖到周末了。昨天就在那只洗衣盆里——苔丝感到一阵后悔的可怕刺痛——就是她身上现在穿的这件白色袍子，她因为粗心在湿漉漉的草地上把它的下摆染绿了——它是由母亲亲手拧干和熨平的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As usual, Mrs Durbeyfield was balanced on one foot beside the tub, the other being engaged in the aforesaid business of rocking her youngest child. The cradle-rockers had done hard duty for so many years, under the weight of so many children, on that flagstone floor, that they were worn nearly flat, in consequence of which a huge jerk accompanied each swing of the cot, flinging the baby from side to side like a weaver's shuttle, as Mrs Durbeyfield, excited by her song, trod the rocker with all the spring that was left in her after a long day's seething in the suds.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="德北菲尔德太太像往常一样，一只脚站在洗衣盆旁，另一只脚正忙着刚才说过的事，就是不停地摇着最小的孩子。那个摇篮的摇轴经历过无数孩子的重压，在石板铺成的地板上已经辛辛苦苦地摇动了许多年，都差不多快要磨平了，因为摇篮的每一次摆动而引起的剧烈震动，都要把摇篮中的孩子像织布的梭子一样从一边抛到另一边。德北菲尔德太太在洗衣盆的泡沫里已经劳累一整天了，在她的歌声的激励下，用她身上剩余的力气踩着摇篮。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There still faintly beamed from the woman's features something of the freshness, and even the prettiness, of her youth; rendering it probable that the personal charms which Tess could boast of were in main part her mother's gift, and therefore unknightly, unhistorical.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在德北菲尔德太太的面目上，还依稀闪耀着一些她当年年轻时候的鲜艳甚至美丽的光辉；这表明也许苔丝可以引为自豪的她身上的美貌，主要是来自她母亲的恩赐，而不是她的骑士血统和历史渊源带来的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Her mother bore Tess no ill-will for leaving the house-work to her single-handed efforts for so long; indeed, Joan seldom up-braided her thereon at any time, feeling but slightly the lack of Tess's assistance whilst her instinctive plan for relieving herself of her labours lay in postponing them. To-night, however, she wis even in a blither mood than usual. There was a dreaminess, a preoccupation, an exaltation, in the maternal look which the girl could not understand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苔丝把家务事留给母亲一个人做，在外面玩得这么久，但母亲并没有埋怨她。说实在的，琼从来都很少因为这个责怪女儿，她只是稍微感到没有苔丝帮忙，要是想让自己干活轻松些，就只能把活儿推到后面去。但是今天晚上，她好像比平常要快乐些。在母亲的脸上，有一种女儿不明白的朦胧恍馏、心不在焉和洋洋得意的神情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'Well, I'm glad you've come,' her mother said, as soon as the last note had passed out of her. 'I want to go and fetch your father; but what's more'n that, I want to tell 'ee what have happened. Y'll be fess enough, my poppet, when th'st know!' (Mrs Durbeyfield habitually spoke the dialect; her daughter, who had passed the Sixth Standard in the National School under a London-trained mistress, spoke two languages; the dialect at home, more or less; ordinary English abroad and to persons of quality.)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，你回来得正好，”她母亲刚把最后一个音唱完就开口说。“我正要出去找你的父亲；不过还有比这更重要的，我要告诉你刚才发生的事。我的小宝贝，你听了一定要高兴的！”德北菲尔德太太习惯于说土话；她的女儿在国立小学里经过伦敦培养的女教师的教育，已经读完了第六年级，因而讲两种语言：在家里或多或少讲土话；在外面和对有教养的人讲普通英语。">查看中文翻译</div>

A curious fetichistic fear of this grimy volume on the part of her mother prevented her ever allowing it to stay in the house all night, and hither it was brought back whenever it had been consulted. Between the mother, with her fast-perishing lumber of superstitions, folk-lore, dialect, and orally transmitted ballads, and the daughter, with her trained National teachings and Standard knowledge under an infinitely Revised Code, there was a gap of two hundred years as ordinarily understood. When they were together the Jacobean and the Victorian ages were juxtaposed.</div>

<div class="line_en">This going to hunt up her shiftless husband at the inn was one of Mrs Durbeyfield's still extant enjoyments in the muck and muddle of rearing children. To discover him at Rolliver's, to sit there for an hour or two by his side and dismiss all thought and care of the children during the interval, made her happy. A sort of halo, an occidental glow, came over life then. Troubles and other realities took on themselves a metaphysical impalpability, sinking to mere mental phenomena for serene contemplation, and no longer stood as pressing concretions which chafed body and soul. The youngsters, not immediately within sight, seemed rather bright and desirable appurtenances than otherwise; the incidents of daily life were not without humorousness and jollity in their aspect there. She felt a little as she had used to feel when she sat by her now wedded husband in the same spot during his wooing, shutting her eyes to his defects of character, and regarding him only in his ideal presentation as lover.</div>

<div class="line_en">Returning along the garden path Tess mused on what the mother could have wished to ascertain from the book on this particular day. She guessed the recent ancestral discovery to bear upon it, but did not divine that it solely concerned herself. Dismissing this, however, she busied herself with sprinkling the linen dried during the daytime, in company with her nine-year-old brother Abraham, and her sister Eliza-Louisa of twelve and a half, called ''Liza-Lu', the youngest ones being put to bed. There was an interval of four years and more between Tess and the next of the family, the two who had filled the gap having died in their infancy, and this lent her a deputy-maternal attitude when she was alone with her Juniors. Next in juvenility to Abraham came two more girls, Hope and Modesty; then a boy of three, and then the baby, who had just completed his first year.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当苔丝沿着花园的小道回屋时，心里默默地想，母亲在今天这个特别的日子里是想从书中查找什么。她猜想这本书同最近她们家祖先的发现有关，但是她却不曾预料到同它有关的只是她自己。但是她不去猜想了，又忙着往白天晾干的衣服上喷了一些水。这时同苔丝在一起的，是已经上床睡觉的九岁的弟弟亚伯拉罕，十二岁的妹妹伊丽萨·露易莎，她又叫丽莎·露，还有一个婴孩。苔丝同挨近她的妹妹相差四岁多，在这段时间空白里，还有两个孩子在襁褓中死了，因此当她单独同弟弟妹妹相处时，她身上的态度就像一个代理母亲。比亚伯拉罕小的是两个女孩子盼盼和素素；然后是一个三岁的男孩，最后是一个刚刚满一周岁的婴孩。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">All these young souls were passengers in the Durbeyfield ship -- entirely dependent on the judgment of the two Durbeyfield adults for their pleasures, their necessities, their health, even their existence. If the heads of the Durbeyfield household chose to sail into difficulty, disaster, starvation, disease, degradation, death, thither were these half-dozen little captives under hatches compelled to sail with them -- six helpless creatures, who had never been asked if they wished for life on any terms, much less if they wished for it on such hard conditions as were involved in being of the shiftless house of Durbeyfield. Some people would like to know whence the poet whose philosophy is in these days deemed as profound and trustworthy as his song is breezy and pure, gets his authority for speaking of 'Nature's holy plan'.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所有这些生灵都是德北菲尔德家族船上的乘客——他们的欢乐、他们的需要、他们的健康、甚至他们的生存，都完全取决于德北菲尔德两口子。假如德北菲尔德家的两个家长选择一条航线，要把这条船开进困苦、灾难、饥饿、疾病、屈辱、死亡中去，那么这些关在船舱里的半打小俘虏也只好被迫同他们一起进去——六个无依无靠的小生命，从来没有人问过他们对生活有什么要求，更没有人问过他们是否愿意生活在艰苦的环境里，就像他们生活在无能为力的德北菲尔德的家中一样。有些人也许想知道，那个说“大自然的神圣计划”的诗人是不是有他的根据，因为近些年来，他的哲学被认为像他的清新纯洁的诗一样，也是深刻和值得相信的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Her mother's fetching simply meant one more to fetch. Tess began to perceive that a man in indifferent health, who proposed to start on a journey before one in the morning, ought not to be at an inn at this late hour celebrating his ancient blood.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的母亲出去找人，简直是又多了一个要找的人。苔丝开始想到，一个身体不大好的人，又要在第二天早上一点钟前上路，就不应该这么晚还呆在酒店里庆祝他的古老的血统。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'Abraham,' she said to her little brother, 'do you put on your hat -- you bain't afraid? -- and go up to Rolliver's, and see what has gone wi' father and mother.'</div>

<div class="line_en">It grew later, and neither father nor mother reappeared. Tess looked out of the door, and took a mental journey through Marlott. The village was shutting its eves. Candles and lamps were being put out everywhere: she could inwardly behold the extinguisher and the extended hand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="天色渐渐晚了，但是父亲和母亲谁也没有回来。苔丝向门外看去，心里把马洛特村想象了一番。村子正在闭上眼睛。所有地方的烛光和灯火都熄灭了：她在心里头能够看见熄灭灯火的人和伸出去的手。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">'Liza-Lu then went to bed, and Tess, locking them all in, started on her way up the dark and crooked lane or street not made for hasty progress; a street laid out before inches of land had value, and when one-handed clocks sufficiently subdivided the day.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那时丽莎·露已经睡觉，苔丝就把他们都锁在屋里，开始走上那条漆黑弯曲的和修来不是用来走急路的小路或者小街；修那条小街的时候，还没有到寸土寸金的程度，而且那时候还是用一根针的时钟指示时间的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The boy jumped promptly from his seat, and opened the door, and the night swallowed him up. Half an hour passed yet again; neither man, woman, nor child returned. Abraham, like his parents, seemed to have been limed and caught by the ensnaring inn.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="孩子立即从床铺上跳下来，把门打开，身影就在黑夜里消失了。又过去了半个小时；男的、女的、老的、小的，谁都没有回来。亚伯拉罕和他的父母一样，似乎也让那个陷阱酒店给同住了、粘住了。">查看中文翻译</div>
