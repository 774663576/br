<div class="line_en">As daylight steadily bleached darkness from the sky that spring morning of 1994, Laila became certain that Rasheed knew. That, any moment now, he would drag her out of bed and ask whether she'd really taken him for such a khar, such a donkey, that he wouldn't find out. But azan rang out, and then the morning sun was falling flat on the rooftops and the roosters were crowing and nothing out of the ordinary happened.</div>

<div class="line_en">Everywhere she looked, Laila saw Rasheed. She spotted him coming out of barbershops with windows the color of coal dust, from tiny booths that sold partridges, from battered, open-fronted stores packed with old tires piled from floor to ceiling.</div>

<div class="line_en">Beside her, Mariam was muttering a prayer. Laila wished she could see her face, but Mariam was in burqa -- they both were -- and all she could see was the glitter of her eyes through the grid.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="玛丽雅姆在她身旁，喃喃念着一段经文。莱拉希望能够看到玛丽雅姆的脸，但她穿着布卡——她们两人都穿着布卡——莱拉只能看见面罩里面她那闪烁的眼光。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">All around her now, Laila saw the consequences of the recent fighting whose sounds she'd heard from the house. Homes that lay in roofless ruins of brick and jagged stone, gouged buildings with fallen beams poking through the holes, the charred, mangled husks of cars, upended, sometimes stacked on top of each other, walls pocked by holes of every conceivable caliber, shattered glass everywhere. She saw a funeral procession marching toward a mosque, a black-clad old woman at the rear tearing at her hair. They passed a cemetery littered with rock-piled graves and ragged shaheed flags fluttering in the breeze.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最近这场战争，莱拉在家中只闻其声，但如今触目所及，尽见其影。房子没有屋顶，变成一堆堆碎砖裂石的废墟；楼座被炸开大洞，梁柱从各处洞口伸了出来；焦黑而扭曲的轿车外壳头下脚上，有的还叠在一起；墙壁上布满了各种口径的弹孔，遍地都是玻璃碎片。她看见一列送葬的队伍正在朝一座清真寺进发，后面有个浑身黑色的老太婆正在揪她自己的头发。她们路过一片墓地，坟墓都是岩石垒成的，破碎的灵幡在和风中飘扬。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This was Laila's first time out of the house in weeks, discounting the short trip to the pawnshop the day before -- where she had pushed her wedding ring across a glass counter, where she'd walked out thrilled by the finality of it, knowing there was no going back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是莱拉几个星期以来第一次走出家门，不算前一天她去当铺的短暂旅途——在那儿的玻璃柜台上，她把结婚戒指推过去；等到交易完毕，她知道自己再也不会回到那个地方，胆战心惊地走了出去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">AT THE Lahore Gate bus station, near Pol Mahmood Khan in East Kabul, a row of buses sat idling along the curbside. Men in turbans were busy heaving bundles and crates onto bus tops, securing suitcases down with ropes. Inside the station, men stood in a long line at the ticket booth. Burqa-clad women stood in groups and chatted, their belongings piled at their feet. Babies were bounced, children scolded for straying too far.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拉合尔门客运站在喀布尔东部，临近马哈穆德汗大桥，那儿的人行道旁边停着一排熄了火的客车。一些身穿长袍的男人正在忙着把包裹和箱子搬上几辆客车的车顶，用绳子绑紧行李箱。车站内的售票窗口之前排了一长队男人。穿着布卡的女人三五成群地站着聊天，她们的行李堆放在脚边。有人上下摇晃怀里抱着的婴孩，有人责骂走得太远的儿童。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Laila reached across the suitcase, wrapped her fingers around the softness of her daughter's arm.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱拉把手伸过行李箱，张开五指，握住她女儿那柔软的手臂。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mujahideen militiamen patrolled the station and the curbside, barking curt orders here and there. They wore boots, pakols, dusty green fatigues. They all carried Kalashnikovs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="圣战组织的士兵在车站内和人行道上巡逻，时不时厉声呵斥，发号施令。他们脚踏皮靴，头戴毡帽，身上的迷彩服沾满灰尘。他们全都带着卡拉什尼科夫冲锋枪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Laila felt watched. She looked no one in the face, but she felt as though every person in this place knew, that they were looking on with disapproval at what she and Mariam were doing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱拉觉得有人盯着她。她不敢去看任何人的脸，但感觉好像这里每个人都知道内情，都不满地看着她和玛丽雅姆正在做的事情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Do you see anybody?" Laila asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你看到什么人了吗？”莱拉问。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This, Laila had known, would be the first risky part, finding a man suitable to pose with them as a family member. The freedoms and opportunities that women had enjoyed between 1978 and 1992 were a thing of the past now -- Laila could still remember Babi saying of those years of communist rule, It's a good time to be a woman in Afghanistan, Laila. Since the Mujahideen takeover in April 1992, Afghanistan's name had been changed to the Islamic State of Afghanistan. The Supreme Court under Rabbani was filled now with hardliner mullahs who did away with the communist-era decrees that empowered women and instead passed rulings based on Shari'a, strict Islamic laws that ordered women to cover, forbade their travel without a male relative, punished adultery with stoning. Even if the actual enforcement of these laws was sporadic at best. But they'd enforce them on us more, Laila had said to Mariam, if they weren't so busy killing each other. And us.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莱拉知道，这是第一个冒险的部分：找到一个合适的男人来假装她们的家人。妇女在1978年至1992年之间享受到的自由和机会如今已经成为过去的东西——莱拉依然记得爸爸对共产党当权那些年所作的评论：现在是阿富汗妇女的好年代，莱拉。自从1992年4月圣战组织上台以来，阿富汗的国号被改成阿富汗伊斯兰国。拉巴尼统治下的最高法院充满了态度强硬的毛拉，他们取消了共产党统治时代那些赋予妇女权利的法令，代之以严厉的伊斯兰教法，要求妇女蒙面，严禁妇女在没有男性亲戚的陪同下出远门，以石刑严惩通奸。只不过这些法令最多只是偶尔落到实处。但如果他们不是忙于自相残杀和戮害我们，莱拉先前对玛丽雅姆说，他们会更加严格地用这些法令来对付我们。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The second risky part of this trip would come when they actually arrived in Pakistan. Already burdened with nearly two million Afghan refugees, Pakistan had closed its borders to Afghans in January of that year. Laila had heard that only those with visas would be admitted. But the border was porous -- always had been -- and Laila knew that thousands of Afghans were still crossing into Pakistan either with bribes or by proving humanitarian grounds -- and there were always smugglers who could be hired. We'll find a way when we get there, she'd told Mariam.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等她们真的到了巴基斯坦，将会碰到这段旅程第二个冒险的部分。巴基斯坦被将近两百万阿富汗难民压得不堪重负，已经于那年元月封锁了和阿富汗接壤的边界。莱拉听说那些持有签证的人才能入境。但边境线有很多缝隙可钻——向来如此——莱拉知道依然有成千上万的阿富汗人通过贿赂或者阐述人道理由而得以进入巴基斯坦——再说到了那儿，还可以花钱请蛇头帮忙。等到了那边，我们会找到办法的，她曾这么告诉玛丽雅姆。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Eventually, Laila found him sitting outside on a park bench, with a veiled woman at his side and a little boy in a skullcap, roughly Aziza's age, bouncing on his knees. He was tall and slender, bearded, wearing an open-collared shirt and a modest gray coat with missing buttons.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，莱拉发现了一个人。那人坐在车站外面的长凳上，旁边有一个蒙着面纱的女人和一个戴着无边便帽的男孩。男孩和阿兹莎差不多年纪，坐在他膝盖上上下晃动。那人高高瘦瘦，留了一把胡子，穿着开领衬衫和缺了几个纽扣的浅灰色外套。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Soon." Laila kissed her daughter, aiming for the forehead, finding the crown of her head instead. "We'll have milk soon. You just be patient. Be a good, patient little girl for Mammy, and I'll get you some aishee."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“很快就有啦，”莱拉向她的女儿亲去，她对准的是前额，亲到的却是头顶。“我们很快就会有牛奶啦。你只要耐心等待就好了。你为妈妈当一个耐心的乖女孩，妈妈给你弄一些牛奶。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Azan rang out a second time and still Rasheed had not given them any food, and, worse, no water. That day, a thick, suffocating heat fell on them. The room turned into a pressure cooker. Laila dragged a dry tongue over her lips, thinking of the well outside, the water cold and fresh. Aziza kept crying, and Laila noticed with alarm that when she wiped her cheeks her hands came back dry. She stripped the clothes off Aziza, tried to find something to fan her with, settled for blowing on her until she became light-headed. Soon, Aziza stopped crawling around. She slipped in and out of sleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="祷告的钟声第二次响起，拉希德依然没有给她们任何食物，更糟糕的是，也不给她们水。那天，一阵闷热降临在她们身上。房间变成了一个高压锅。莱拉干涸的舌头舔过发焦的嘴唇，想起了外面那口水井，想起了冰凉而清甜的井水。阿兹莎不停地哭泣，莱拉发觉当自己去擦拭她的脸颊时，抽回来的双手竟然是干的，她不由一惊。她脱掉阿兹莎身上的衣服，却找不到什么东西可以给她扇风，只好对着她吹气，直到吹得自己头昏脑涨。很快，阿兹莎不再满地爬。她不停地睡去又醒来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Several times that day, Laila banged her fists against the walls, used up her energy screaming for help, hoping that a neighbor would hear. But no one came, and her shrieking only frightened Aziza, who began to cry again, a weak, croaking sound. Laila slid to the ground. She thought guiltily of Mariam, beaten and bloodied, locked in this heat in the toolshed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天，莱拉好几次用拳头猛敲墙壁，拼尽全身力气高喊救命，希望有邻居会听见。但没有人来，她的尖叫只吓坏了阿兹莎，她又哭了起来，发出一阵微弱的哽咽。莱拉无可奈何地瘫倒在地上。她心怀愧疚地想起了玛丽雅姆，玛丽雅姆被打得遍体鳞伤，血迹斑斑，被锁在同样炎热的工具棚之中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Laila fell asleep at some point, her body baking in the heat. She had a dream that she and Aziza had run into Tariq. He was across a crowded street from them, beneath the awning of a tailor's shop. He was sitting on his haunches and sampling from a crate of figs. That's your father, Laila said. That man there, you see him? He's your real baba. She called his name, but the street noise drowned her voice, and Tariq didn't hear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不知道什么时候，莱拉睡着了，她的身体在炎热中渐渐变干。她梦见她和阿兹莎碰到塔里克。他在一家裁缝店的遮阳篷之下，和她们之间隔着一条拥挤的马路。他蹲在地上，品尝着一盘无花果。那是你的父亲，莱拉说，那边的男人，你看到他了吗？他才是你的爸爸。她喊出他的名字，但马路上的噪声盖住她的嗓音，塔里克没有听到。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She woke up to the whistling of rockets streaking overhead. Somewhere, the sky she couldn't see erupted with blasts and the long, frantic hammering of machine-gun fire. Laila closed her eyes. She woke again to Rasheed's heavy footsteps in the hallway. She dragged herself to the door, slapped her palms against it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她醒过来，听见火箭弹从上空呼啸而过。在某个地方，她无法看见的天空爆发出一道道火光，紧接着传来一阵猛烈的冲锋枪开火的声音。莱拉闭上了双眼。等到再次醒来的时候，她听见走廊传来拉希德沉重的脚步声。她扑向房门，使劲用手掌拍打它。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Laila put her ear over Aziza's mouth, dreading each time that she would not hear the shallow whooshing of breath. Even this simple act of lifting herself made her head swim. She fell asleep, had dreams she could not remember. When she woke up, she checked on Aziza, felt the parched cracks of her lips, the faint pulse at her neck, lay down again. They would die here, of that Laila was sure now, but what she really dreaded was that she would outlast Aziza, who was young and brittle. How much more could Aziza take? Aziza would die in this heat, and Laila would have to lie beside her stiffening little body and wait for her own death. Again she fell asleep. Woke up. Fell asleep. The line between dream and wakefulness blurred.</div>

<div class="line_en">It wasn't roosters or azan that woke her up again but the sound of something heavy being dragged. She heard a rattling. Suddenly, the room was flooded with light. Her eyes screamed in protest. Laila raised her head, winced, and shielded her eyes. Through the cracks between her fingers, she saw a big, blurry silhouette standing in a rectangle of light. The silhouette moved. Now there was a shape crouching beside her, looming over her, and a voice by her ear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="再次将她惊醒的，既不是祷告的钟声，也不是公鸡的啼叫，而是某些沉重的东西被拖开的声音。她听见钥匙开锁的声音。突然之间，房间充满了光线。她的眼睛被刺得睁不开。莱拉抬起头，哆嗦着，用手掩住眼睛。透过指缝，她看见一个巨大而模糊的身影站在一片长方形的光线中。那个身影动了起来。这时有个人形蹲在她身边，俯视着她，一个声音在她耳边响起。">查看中文翻译</div>
