<div class="line_en">It began one evening after supper. Dill was over; Aunt Alexandra was in her chair in the corner, Atticus was in his; Jem and I were on the floor reading. It had been a placid week: I had minded Aunty; Jem had outgrown the treehouse, but helped Dill and me construct a new rope ladder for it; Dill had hit upon a foolproof plan to make Boo Radley come out at no cost to ourselves (place a trail of lemon drops from the back door to the front yard and he'd follow it, like an ant). There was a knock on the front door, Jem answered it and said it was Mr. Heck Tate.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Never heard of any Catholics in Maycomb either," said Atticus, "you're confusing that with something else. Way back about nineteen-twenty there was a Klan, but it was a political organization more than anything. Besides, they couldn't find anybody to scare. They paraded by Mr. Sam Levy's house one night, but Sam just stood on his porch and told 'em things had come to a pretty pass, he'd sold 'em the very sheets on their backs. Sam made 'em so ashamed of themselves they went away."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“也从没听说过是梅科姆的天主教徒，”阿迪克斯说，“你把别的事和这混在一起了。大概在1920年，有过一个卡兰党，但那实际是一个政治团体，并非别的什么。另外，他们谁也吓唬不了。有一晚，他们在萨姆·莱维先生家门口结队游行，但是萨姆只站在门前走廊上，告诉他们他境况已经很糟，连被单都卖给他们了。萨姆使他们羞愧得走开了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I walked home with Dill and returned in time to overhear Atticus saying to Aunty, "…in favor of Southern womanhood as much as anybody, but not for preserving polite fiction at the expense of human life," a pronouncement that made me suspect they had been fussing again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当晚，我和迪尔一道回家，恰恰偶然听见阿迪克斯对姑妈说：“……和任何人一样支持南部妇女，但不赞成牺牲人命来保存虚伪的传统观念。”听了这话，我怀疑他们又在吵嘴。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Next day was Sunday. In the interval between Sunday School and Church when the congregation stretched its legs, I saw Atticus standing in the yard with another knot of men. Mr. Heck Tate was present, and I wondered if he had seen the light. He never went to church. Even Mr. Underwood was there. Mr. Underwood had no use for any organization but The Maycomb Tribune, of which he was the sole owner, editor, and printer. His days were spent at his linotype, where he refreshed himself occasionally from an ever-present gallon jug of cherry wine. He rarely gathered news; people brought it to him. It was said that he made up every edition of The Maycomb Tribune out of his own head and wrote it down on the linotype. This was believable. Something must have been up to haul Mr. Underwood out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天是星期天，主日学校的课上完了，礼拜还没开始，来做礼拜的人都在外面散步。我看见阿迪克斯同另外一群人站在院子里。赫克—塔特先生在人群中，我不知道他是不是醒悟过来了。他是从不做礼拜的。甚至安德伍德先生也在场。不管叫什么团体组织，对安德伍德先生都不起作用。他只经营他的Ⅸ梅科姆论坛报》。他一个人兼任报馆的老板、编辑。他的时间都消磨在排版机旁，只偶尔从旁边的一个能盛一加仑的罐子里喝点樱桃酒提提神，那罐子随时都在手边。他很少采访新闻，新闻都是人们给他进去的。据说每期报纸都是他先在脑子里想好，然后弄到排版机上写成文字。这点可以相信。连安德伍德先生也给拖了出来，肯定出了点什么事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The fake peace that prevailed on Sundays was made more irritating by Aunt Alexandra's presence. Atticus would flee to his office directly after dinner, where if we sometimes looked in on him, we would find him sitting back in his swivel chair reading. Aunt Alexandra composed herself for a two-hour nap and dared us to make any noise in the yard, the neighborhood was resting. Jem in his old age had taken to his room with a stack of football magazines. So Dill and I spent our Sundays creeping around in Deer's Pasture.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这几个星期天只是表面上平平静静，亚历山德拉姑妈在这里更使人不快。阿迪克斯一吃过饭就溜到了事务所，如果我们去看他，会发现他靠在转椅上读着书。亚历山德拉姑妈每天总要睡上两小时午觉，还威胁我们不准在院子里闹出响声。邻居们也都在休息。年龄日益增长的杰姆也爱守着一堆橄榄球杂志缩在屋里。这样，我和迪尔便在迪尔牧场上转来转去，打发一个个星期天。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I caught Atticus coming in the door, and he said that they'd moved Tom Robinson to the Maycomb jail. He also said, more to himself than to me, that if they'd kept him there in the first place there wouldn't have been any fuss. I watched him take his seat on the third row from the front, and I heard him rumble, "Nearer my God to thee," some notes behind the rest of us. He never sat with Aunty, Jem and me. He liked to be by himself in church.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我在阿迪克斯进门时碰上了他。他说汤姆已被转到了梅科姆监狱。他又说——与其说是对我说，不如说是自言自语t“如果一开始就关进那地方，也就不会有什么可争议的了。”我看见他在前面第三排坐下，听见他在我们唱完一首赞美诗后，还在低沉地唱着：“愿与我主更亲近，”他从不和我们坐在一起，做礼拜的时候他总爱独自一个人坐。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="过了一会儿，我向姑妈和哥哥道了晚安，捧着一本书正看得起劲，只听见杰姆在自已屋里弄得四处格格直响。他上床的声音我是熟悉的。我就去敲他的门。“你为什么还不睡觉？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Our father had a few peculiarities: one was, he never ate desserts; another was that he liked to walk. As far back as I could remember, there was always a Chevrolet in excellent condition in the carhouse, and Atticus put many miles on it in business trips, but in Maycomb he walked to and from his office four times a day, covering about two miles. He said his only exercise was walking. In Maycomb, if one went for a walk with no definite purpose in mind, it was correct to believe one's mind incapable of definite purpose.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爸爸有几个怪癖：一是，饭后从不吃甜点心，另一个就是，他喜欢步行。从我能记事的时候起，车库里就有一辆切佛罗里德牌汽车，保养得极好，阿迪克斯开着它出差跑过好多公里，但在梅科姆，他每天从事务所到家步行两个来回，大约一共两英里路。他说他唯一的锻炼就是散步。在梅科姆，如果一个人脑子里没有明确目的地在外面走，那么相信他脑子里不可能有明确目的，那是准没错的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Maycomb jail was the most venerable and hideous of the county's buildings. Atticus said it was like something Cousin Joshua St. Clair might have designed. It was certainly someone's dream. Starkly out of place in a town of square-faced stores and steep-roofed houses, the Maycomb jail was a miniature Gothic joke one cell wide and two cells high, complete with tiny battlements and flying buttresses. Its fantasy was heightened by its red brick facade and the thick steel bars at its ecclesiastical windows. It stood on no lonely hill, but was wedged between Tyndal's Hardware Store and The Maycomb Tribune office. The jail was Maycomb's only conversation piece: its detractors said it looked like a Victorian privy; its supporters said it gave the town a good solid respectable look, and no stranger would ever suspect that it was full of niggers.</div>
