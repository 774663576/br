<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，没事，”韦斯莱先生平淡地说，“不过他们被狠狠地罚了一笔。我想他们大概不会再仓促行事了。你可千万不要拿幻影显形当儿戏。许多成年巫师都不愿惹这个麻烦。他们情愿用扫帚——虽然慢一些，可是安全。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">All in all, the atmosphere was not very friendly as they took their departure. Mrs. Weasley was still glowering as she kissed Mr. Weasley on the cheek, though not nearly as much as the twins, who had each hoisted their rucksacks onto their backs and walked out without a word to her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="总之，他们离开的时候，气氛不是很友好。韦斯莱夫人亲吻韦斯莱先生的面颊时，仍然板着面孔。那对孪生兄弟的态度更坏。他们把帆布背包甩到背上，一句话没对妈妈说就走了出去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's been a massive organizational problem," sighed Mr. Weasley. "The trouble is, about a hundred thousand wizards turn up at the World Cup, and of course, we just haven't got a magical site big enough to accommodate them all. There are places Muggles can't penetrate, but imagine trying to pack a hundred thousand wizards into Diagon Alley or platform nine and three-quarters. So we had to find a nice deserted moor, and set up as many anti-Muggle precautions as possible. The whole Ministry's been working on it for months. First, of course, we have to stagger the arrivals. People with cheaper tickets have to arrive two weeks beforehand. A limited number use Muggle transport, but we can't have too many clogging up their buses and trains -- remember, wizards are coming from all over the world. Some Apparate, of course, but we have to set up safe points for them to appear, well away from Muggles. I believe there's a handy wood they're using as the Apparition point. For those who don't want to Apparate, or can't, we use Portkeys. They're objects that are used to transport wizards from one spot to another at a prearranged time. You can do large groups at a time if you need to. There have been two hundred Portkeys placed at strategic points around Britain, and the nearest one to us is up at the top of Stoatshead Hill, so that's where we're headed."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“组织工作真是困难重重，”韦斯莱先生叹了口气，“主要的问题是，大约有十万巫师要来观看世界杯，我们当然找不到一个能容纳这么多人的魔法场地。虽然有些地方是麻瓜们进不去的，但是想象一下，我们怎么可能把十万巫师都塞进对角巷或9又3/4站台呢？所以我们不得不找一片荒芜人烟的沼泽地，并采取了一切防备麻瓜的措施。整个部里为这件事忙了好几个月。首先，当然啦，我们必须把大家到达的时间错开。球票便宜的人只好提前几个星期赶到。一部分人使用麻瓜的交通工具，但人数有限，毕竟我们不能让太多的人塞满麻瓜的公共汽车和火车——别忘了，世界各地都有巫师赶来。当然，还有一些人采用幻影显形术，但我们必须规定一些安全的地方让他们显形，远离所有的麻瓜。我想附近大概正好有座森林，可以作为幻影显形的落脚点。对于那些不愿意或者不会幻影显形的人，我们就使用门钥匙。这玩意儿的作用是在规定时间内把巫师从一个地方运送到另一个地方。如果需要的话，一次可以运送一大批人。魔法部在英国各地投放了近两百把门钥匙，离我们最近的一把就在白鼬山的山顶上，我们现在就是去那里。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Well, have a lovely time," said Mrs. Weasley, "and behave yourselves," she called after the twins' retreating backs, but they did not look back or answer.

<div class="line_cn" title="“再见，祝你们玩得痛快，”韦斯莱夫人说，“表现好一点儿。”她冲着孪生兄弟离去的背影喊道，可是他们既没有回头，也没有回答。“我中午的时候打发比尔、查理和珀西上路。”韦斯莱夫人对韦斯莱先生说。这时，韦斯莱先生正和哈利、罗恩、赫敏、金妮穿过漆黑的院子，跟在弗雷德和乔治后面出发了。">查看中文翻译</div>
