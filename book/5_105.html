<div class="line_en">Tully did not suffer from the same malaise. While she still cried about Chad when they were drinking late at night, she had no problem meeting guys and bringing them home. Kate had yet to see the same guy come out of Tully's bedroom twice. According to Tully, that was the plan. She had, or so she said, no intention of falling in love. In retrospect, of course, Tully came to believe that she'd loved Chad desperately, so much so that no other man could measure up. But not enough, as Kate repeatedly pointed out, to call him or move to Tennessee.</div>

<div class="line_en">Without Tully, Kate's life lost its shape, and like some overwashed sweater, no amount of positioning or folding could make it right again. Her mother told her repeatedly to snap out of her funk and start dating, have some fun, but how could she date when she had no interest in the guys who had interest in her?</div>

<div class="line_en">From the moment Tully took the new job, Kate found herself watching her friend's life from a distance. Month after month passed with them living separate lives, connected only by place. By the following summer's end, their tiny apartment, once the container of their lives, had become something of a way station. Tully spent twelve hours a day, seven days a week, working. When she wasn't technically at work, she was chasing down leads and following stories, trying like hell to do something -- anything -- that would put her in front of the camera.</div>

<div class="line_en">After that long night spent together in the hospital waiting room, Kate had thought there might actually be some hope. She'd felt that a door had opened between them; they'd talked easily, and about important things. But whatever inroads had been made in the bright light of the waiting room had faded with the dawn. She'd never forget the look on his face when he learned that Tully would be fine. It was more than relief.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一起在医院等候室度过慢慢长夜之后，凯蒂原本以为会有一丝希望。她感觉两人之间开了一扇门，他们可以轻松交谈，而且谈的都是有意义的话题，然而，在等候室明亮灯光下所产生的那一点进展，随着黎明的到来渐渐褪色。她永远忘不了他听到塔莉没有大碍时的表情，那绝不止是松了一口气而已。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="凯蒂知道爱是什么，明白爱能让人神魂颠倒，也能榨干一颗心。单恋凄凉又悲惨，她像是一颗次等行星，整日绕着强尼的轨道运行，在孤寂的沉默中看着他、渴望他、为他心痛。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She turned around and saw Tully in the doorway; her friend wore her dating clothes -- an artfully torn sweatshirt that exposed one bare shoulder, jeans tucked into slouchy ankle boots, and a big low-slung belt.

<div class="line_en">As soon as her workday had ended, she'd gone to the newsstand in the Public Market and purchased all the local papers. While Tully was out bar-hopping with her guy du jour, or working late, Kate intended to rechart the course of her life.</div>

<div class="line_en">But what good would come of that? Kate knew how Johnny felt about Tully, how he'd always felt.

<div class="line_en">At some point during the endless, excruciating evening, Tully went to the bathroom and left Johnny and Kate alone.

<div class="line_cn" title="这个犹如无尽酷刑的夜晚中，有一段时间塔莉去洗手间，留下强尼与凯蒂独处。她努力想找话说，但实际上却不敢看他的双眼。他的头发湿润微鬈、脸颊红润，模样性感得令她心痛。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"She's really something," he said. Behind him, the band finished their song and turned to their sheet music for inspiration. "I was starting to think it would never happen… her and me," he said, sipping his beer, gazing back toward the bathroom, as if he could draw her back by will alone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“她真的不同凡响。”他说，身后的乐团一曲奏罢，正在翻谱寻找灵感。“我本来已经准备放弃了，接受我和她永远没机会。”他喝了一口啤酒，望着洗手间的方向，仿佛想凭意志力将她拉回来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You should be careful," Kate said almost too quietly to be heard. She knew the words, and the warning, would reveal something of her heart, but she couldn't help herself. Johnny might wear the suit of a cynic at work, but at the hospital she'd learned the truth. Inside, where it mattered, he was an idealist. No one bruised as easily as a believer. She should know.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我劝你当心点。”凯蒂的声音很低，几乎听不见。她知道说这些话会揭露自己的真心，但她没办法不说。强尼在工作上或许表现得愤世嫉俗，然而在医院那一夜，她发现到其实他的内心依旧怀抱着理想，相信梦想的人最容易受伤，她自己亲身体会过。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the months since their party night at Kells Pub, Kate was not the only one to notice the change in Johnny. As autumn settled into the city and stripped it of color, the mood in the office became sullen and quiet. Mutt kept completely to himself, cleaning and rearranging his equipment, filing negatives in notebooks. Carol, who had been cajoled back to work after Tully's departure, stayed in her own office, with the door shut, barely saying a word to everyone, even when she got her coffee.</div>

<div class="line_en">The first few times he'd come to work this way, they'd rallied around him like geese, clucking their worry.

She'd dressed carefully for today in a plain black wool gabardine suit, with a white blouse and a silk paisley tie tamed into a floppy bow at her throat. She hoped it was a look that said professional through and through. "In my years in TV news I've learned a few things about myself and a few things about the world. The news, as you know, is go-go-go. We're always moving at top speed, just getting the facts and then moving on. I often find myself more interested in what comes after the story than the story itself. I'm better, I believe, at long-range thinking and planning. Details, rather than broad strokes. And I'm a good writer. I'd like to learn more about that, but I won't do it in ten-second sound bites."</div>
