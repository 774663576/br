<div class="line_en">"So what does ignorance have to do with greed and fear?" I asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“无知是怎样与恐惧、贪婪相联的？”我问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Because it is ignorance about money that causes so much greed and so much fear," said rich dad. "Let me give you some examples. A doctor, wanting more money to better provide for his family, raises his fees. By raising his fees, it makes health care more expensive for everyone. Now, it hurts the poor people the most, so poor people have worse health than those with money.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对钱的无知导致了如此之多的恐惧和贪婪的产生。我可以给你一些例子。一个医生，想多挣些钱来更好地养活家人，就提高了收费，这就使每个人的医疗支出增加，这一切最无情地损害了穷人的利益，所以穷人的医疗状况比富人差。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Because the doctors raise their rates, the attorneys raise their rates. Because the attorneys' rates have gone up, schoolteachers want a raise, which raises our taxes, and on and on and on. Soon, there will be such a horrifying gap between the rich and the poor that chaos will break out and another great civilization will collapse. Great civilizations collapsed when the gap between the haves and have-nots was too great. America is on the same course, proving once again that history repeats itself, because we do not learn from history. We only memorize historical dates and names, not the lesson.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="由于医生提高收费，则律师也提高收费；由于律师提高收费，学校老师也想增加收入，这就迫使政府提高税收。这样一环套一环，不久，在富人和穷人之间就有了一条可怕的鸿沟，混乱就会爆发。当鸿沟大到了极点时，一个社会就会崩溃。美国同样身在其中，这种历史一再重演，因为人们没有以史为鉴。我们只是记住了历史事件发生的时间和名称，却没有记住教训。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes," said rich dad. "But all too often, business schools train employees who are sophisticated bean counters. Heaven forbid a bean counter takes over a business. All they do is look at the numbers, fire people and kill the business. I know because I hire bean counters. All they think about is cutting costs and raising prices, which cause more problems. Bean counting is important. I wish more people knew it, but it, too, is not the whole picture," added rich dad angrily.</div>

Instead of just getting up and going to work to solve your problems, just because the fear of not having the money to pay your bills is scaring you. Thinking would be taking the time to ask yourself a question. A question like, `Is working harder at this the best solution to this problem?' Most people are so terrified at not telling themselves the truth -- that fear is in control -- that they cannot think, and instead run out the door. Tar baby is in control. That's what I mean by choosing your thoughts."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，确定我们该怎样思考而不只是对情感作出反应。不要用因为害怕没钱付账而起床工作的方法来解决你的问题。你要花时间去想这样的问题，更努力地工作是解决问题的最好方法吗？许多人都害怕对自己说出真相。他们被恐惧所支配，不敢去思考，于是就出门去找工作，因为恐惧在支配着他们。这就是我说的确定你的思想。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I must admit, it was a great lesson to be getting. To know when someone was speaking out of emotions or out of clear thought. It was a lesson that served me well for life. Especially when I was the one speaking out of reaction and not from clear thought.</div>

He went on to explain that when Mike and I were casting 5-cent pieces out of lead, thinking we were making money, we were very close to thinking the way the rich think. The problem was that it was illegal for us to do it. It was legal for the government and banks to do it, but not us. He explained that there are legal ways to make money and illegal ways.</div>

Keep using your brain, work for free, and soon your mind will show you ways of making money far beyond what I could ever pay you. You will see things that other people never see. Opportunities right in front of their noses. Most people never see these opportunities because they're looking for money and security, so that's all they get. The moment you see one opportunity, you will see them for the rest of your life. The moment you do that, I'll teach you something else. Learn this, and you'll avoid one of life's biggest traps.

<div class="line_en">Our partnership was revived. Mike's mom had a spare room in the basement that no one used. We cleaned it out, and began piling hundreds of comic books in that room.

She charged each child 10 cents admission to the library, which was open from 2:30 to 4:30 p. m. every day after school. The customers, the children of the neighborhood, could read as many comics as they could in two hours.
