<div class="line_en">Two days later the army of the West was all assembled on the Pelennor. The host of Orcs and Easterlings had turned back out of Anórien, but harried and scattered by the Rohirrim they had broken and fled with little fighting towards Cair Andros; and with that threat destroyed and new strength arriving out of the South the City was as well manned as might be. Scouts reported that no enemies remained upon the roads east as far as the Cross-roads of the Fallen King. All now was ready for the last throw.</div>

Peregrin shall go and represent the Shire-folk; and do not grudge him his chance of peril, for though he has done as well as his fortune allowed him, he has yet to match your deed.

<div class="line_en">And so despondently Merry now stood and watched the mustering of the army. Bergil was with him, and he also was downcast; for his father was to march leading a company of the Men of the City: he could not rejoin the Guard until his case was judged. In that same company Pippin was also to go, as a soldier of Gondor. Merry could see him not far off, a small but upright figure among the tall men of Minas Tirith.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因此，梅里只能万分沮丧地看着部队集结。伯几尔站在他身边，他觉得非常难过，因为他的父亲准备领着城中战士的连队参战，在他的罪名宣判之前，他不能够重回城中的卫戍部队；皮聘则是以刚铎战士的身份，和贝瑞贡在同一个连队。梅里可以看见他就在不远的地方，在米那斯提力斯的高大战士之中，他是一个矮小但抬头挺胸的家伙。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As if recalled by his mood of despair, the pain in his arm returned, and he felt weak and old, and the sunlight seemed thin. He was roused by the touch of Bergil's hand.</div>

<div class="line_en">At last the trumpets rang and the army began to move. Troop by troop, and company by company, they wheeled and went off eastward. And long after they had passed away out of sight down the great road to the Causeway, Merry stood there. The last glint of the morning sun on spear and helm twinkled and was lost, and still he remained with bowed head and heavy heart, feeling friendless and alone. Everyone that he cared for had gone away into the gloom that hung over the distant eastern sky; and little hope at all was left in his heart that he would ever see any of them again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后，号角声响起，部队开拔，一营接一营、一连接一连，他们向东而去，在他们离开许久之后，梅里还是站在那边。晨光照在枪尖和头盔上的最后反光也消失了，心情沉重的梅里还是低着头站在那边，他觉得好孤独，身边一个朋友也没有。每个他关心的人都去了那黯淡的东方，在他心中并不觉得自己还有机会再和他们相聚。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The vanguard passed on through the ruins of Old Gondor, and over the wide River, and on up the long straight road that in the high days had been made to run from the fair Tower of the Sun to the tall Tower of the Moon, which now was Minas Morgul in its accursed vale. Five miles beyond Osgiliath they halted, ending their first day's march.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ere noon the army came to Osgiliath. There all the workers and craftsmen that could be spared were busy.

<div class="line_cn" title="在中午之前，部队就抵达了奥斯吉力亚斯。所有能够抽调出来的石匠和工人，全都忙得不可开交。有些人在整修敌人大败撤退时，所破坏的浮桥和渡筏，有些人在收集各式各样的补给品，其他在河对岸的工人，则是赶工摆设克难的防御措施。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But the horsemen pressed on and ere evening they came to the Cross-roads and the great ring of trees, and all was silent. No sign of any enemy had they seen, no cry or call had been heard, no shaft had sped from rock or thicket by the way, yet ever as they went forward they felt the watchfulness of the land increase. Tree and stone, blade and leaf were listening. The darkness had been dispelled, and far away westward sunset was on the Vale of Anduin, and the white peaks of the mountains blushed in the blue air; but a shadow and a gloom brooded upon the Ephel Dúath.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then Aragorn set trumpeters at each of the four roads that ran into the ring of trees, and they blew a great fanfare, and the heralds cried aloud: "The Lords of Gondor have returned and all this land that is theirs they take back." The hideous orc-head that was set upon the carven figure was cast down and broken in pieces, and the old king's head was raised and set in its place once more, still crowned with white and golden flowers; and men laboured to wash and pare away all the foul scrawls that orcs had put upon the stone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="亚拉冈朝十字路口的四个方向都派出了号手，他们一齐吹响震耳的军乐，传令官大喊着：“刚铎之王已经回来了，他要收回所有属于他的土地！”这里雕像被安插的丑恶半兽人脑袋，也被砍了下来，敲成碎片，古王的头颅则被置放回去，上面依旧有着白色和金色的花朵，人们努力试图抹去半兽人们在石雕上留下的痕迹。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now in their debate some had counselled that Minas Morgul should first be assailed, and if they might take it, it should be utterly destroyed. "And, maybe," said Imrahil, "the road that leads thence to the pass above will prove an easier way of assault upon the Dark Lord than his northern gate."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着，众人开始争论往后该何去何从，有些人说他们应该先攻击米那斯魔窟，如果成功了，应该将它彻底摧毁。“而且，”印拉希尔说：“或许从那边通过隘口，会是突击黑暗魔君最好的途径，我们就不需直接从北门正面攻击。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But against this Gandalf had spoken urgently, because of the evil that dwelt in the valley, where the minds of living men would turn to madness and horror, and because also of the news that Faramir had brought. For if the Ring-bearer had indeed attempted that way, then above all they should not draw the Eye of Mordor thither. So the next day when the main host came up, they set a strong guard upon the Cross-roads to make some defence, if Mordor should send a force over the Morgul Pass, or should bring more men up from the South. For that guard they chose mostly archers who knew the ways of Ithilien and would lie hid in the woods and slopes about the meeting of the ways. But Gandalf and Aragorn rode with the vanguard to the entrance of Morgul Vale and looked on the evil city.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="甘道夫反对这项意见，一方面是因为那山谷中的邪恶力量，会让人们变得疯狂和恐惧；一方面则是因为法拉墨所带回来的消息，如果魔戒持有者真的走这条路，那么他们就绝不能让魔王的注意力转移到这里。因此，当第二天主力部队出发时，他们决定在十字路口设下坚强的防御工事，至少可以暂时阻止从魔窟或是南方来的敌人增援。这些留守的部队大多是熟悉伊西立安环境的弓箭手，他们可以躲藏在森林和斜坡上，不需要和敌人正面作战。甘道夫和亚拉冈跟着前锋来到了魔窟谷的入口，观察那座邪恶的城市。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was dark and lifeless; for the Orcs and lesser creatures of Mordor that had dwelt there had been destroyed in battle, and the Nazgûl were abroad. Yet the air of the valley was heavy with fear and enmity. Then they broke the evil bridge and set red flames in the noisome fields and departed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那是个黑暗、了无生气的地方，因为居住在那边的半兽人和魔多的怪物都已经战死了，戒灵也离开了该处，不过，谷中的空气依旧充满了恐惧和憎恨。于是，他们破坏了谷口的桥梁，放火烧掉谷口的植物，然后就离开了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The day after, being the third day since they set out from Minas Tirith, the army began its northward march along the road. It was some hundred miles by that way from the Cross-roads to the Morannon, and what might befall them before they came so far none knew. They went openly but heedfully, with mounted scouts before them on the road, and others on foot upon either side, especially on the eastward flank; for there lay dark thickets, and a tumbled land of rocky ghylls and crags, behind which the long grim slopes of the Ephel Dúath clambered up. The weather of the world remained fair, and the wind held in the west, but nothing could waft away the glooms and the sad mists that clung about the Mountains of Shadow; and behind them at whiles great smokes would arise and hover in the upper winds.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="隔天，也就是他们离开米那斯提力斯的第三天，部队开始沿着道路往北方移动。从十字路口到摩拉南大约有一百多哩，没有人知道在他们抵达目标之前会遇上什么，他们光明正大的前进，但依旧十分谨慎。骑马的斥候会先探勘前方的状况，后方的步兵则是平均散在两边，特别是东方的侧翼，因为那个方向是黑暗的森林，还有崎岖的峡谷和峭壁，在那之后则是陡峭的伊菲尔杜斯。天气还是相当良好，风向依然是西风，但在黯影山脉的迷雾中，一切照旧不为所动，山脉有时还会升起诡异的黑烟，在空中飘汤。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ever and anon Gandalf let blow the trumpets, and the heralds would cry: "The Lords of Gondor are come! Let all leave this land or yield them up!" But Imrahil said: "Say not The Lords of Gondor. Say The King Elessar. For that is true, even though he has not yet sat upon the throne; and it will give the Enemy more thought, if the heralds use that name." And thereafter thrice a day the heralds proclaimed the coming of the King Elessar. But none answered the challenge.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="甘道夫下令号手，每隔一段时间都必须吹响号角，传令官则会配合着大喊：“刚铎之王来了！离开这块土地，把它还给我们！”但印拉希尔插嘴道：“不要说刚铎之王，用人皇伊力萨会更好。虽然他还没有继承王位，但这是千真万确的；如果传令官用这个名号，会让魔王更加担心。”因此，传令官之后会一天三次宣布伊力萨王到来的消息，但依旧没有人回应他们的挑衅。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Nonetheless, though they marched in seeming peace, the hearts of all the army, from the highest to the lowest, were downcast, and with every mile that they went north foreboding of evil grew heavier on them. It was near the end of the second day of their march from the Cross-roads that they first met any offer of battle. For a strong force of Orcs and Easterlings attempted to take their leading companies in an ambush; and that was in the very place where Faramir had waylaid the men of Harad, and the road went in a deep cutting through an out-thrust of the eastward hills. But the Captains of the West were well warned by their scouts, skilled men from Henneth Annûn led by Mablung; and so the ambush was itself trapped. For horsemen went wide about westward and came up on the flank of the enemy and from behind, and they were destroyed or driven east into the hills.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不论如何，当他们在这种看似平静无波的状况下行进时，全军的士气都在逐渐的低落，随着他们越来越深入敌境，这种状况也越来越严重。到了离开十字路口的第二天快结束时，他们才第一次遇到了敌人。一支由半兽人和东方人所组成，相当强大的部队，想要以偷袭的方式消灭先头部队；那个地方刚好就是法拉墨埋伏哈拉德林人的地方，该处的道路正位于山丘的俯视之下。不过，这些人的行踪早就被马伯龙带领下汉那斯安南的斥候给发现了，因此，这场埋伏本身反而成了偷袭的对象。西方部队的将领派出了骑兵绕过山丘，从敌人的侧翼和后方展开攻击，消灭了大部分的敌人，其余则被赶入山中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So time and the hopeless journey wore away. Upon the fourth day from the Cross-roads and the sixth from Minas Tirith they came at last to the end of the living lands, and began to pass into the desolation that lay before the gates of the Pass of Cirith Gorgor; and they could descry the marshes and the desert that stretched north and west to the Emyn Muil. So desolate were those places and so deep the horror that lay on them that some of the host were unmanned, and they could neither walk nor ride further north.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这场无望的旅程依旧继续着。到了离开十字路口的第四天，也是从米那斯提力斯出发的第六天，他们终于来到人类国度的尽头，开始进入了西力斯葛哥隘口，他们从那边可以看见往北和往西延伸到爱明莫尔高地的腐臭沼泽和沙漠。这个地方死气沉沉，散发强烈的恐怖气息，导致部队中有些人完全崩溃，连路都走不动。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But the victory did little to enhearten the captains. "It is but a feint," said Aragorn; "and its chief purpose, I deem, was rather to draw us on by a false guess of our Enemy's weakness than to do us much hurt, yet." And from that evening onward the Nazgûl came and followed every move of the army. They still flew high and out of sight of all save Legolas, and yet their presence could be felt, as a deepening of shadow and a dimming of the sun; and though the Ringwraiths did not yet stoop low upon their foes and were silent, uttering no cry, the dread of them could not be shaken off.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，这胜利无法提振众人的士气。“这是佯攻，”亚拉冈说：“我认为这场攻击的目的不过是让我们轻敌，只是为了引诱我们深入的诱饵而已。”从那天傍晚之后，戒灵无时无刻不在高空监视，观察这部队的一举一动。他们飞得很高，只有勒苟拉斯看得见，但人们还是可以感觉到他们的行踪，太阳彷佛跟着黯淡下来，人们的情绪也跟着低落。虽然戒灵还没有朝着敌人俯冲，也没有发出任何的声响，但他们如影随形的恐惧感，还是令人难以摆脱。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Aragorn looked at them, and there was pity in his eyes rather than wrath; for these were young men from Rohan, from Westfold far away, or husbandmen from Lossarnach, and to them Mordor had been from childhood a name of evil, and yet unreal, a legend that had no part in their simple life; and now they walked like men in a hideous dream made true, and they understood not this war nor why fate should lead them to such a pass.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="亚拉冈看着他们，他的眼中只有怜悯，没有愤怒；因为这些人都是洛汗的年轻人，他们是从远方的西谷来的，或是罗萨那奇的农夫。对他们来说，从小魔多就是邪恶的象征，但却是隐藏于噩梦中、不真实的名称，与他们俭朴的生活一点关系也没有。现在，他们却必须面对这成真的噩梦，他们一点也不明白，为什么这场战争或命运会安排他们来到这个地方。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It grew cold. As morning came the wind began to stir again, but now it came from the North, and soon it freshened to a rising breeze. All the night-walkers were gone, and the land seemed empty. North amid their noisome pits lay the first of the great heaps and hills of slag and broken rock and blasted earth, the vomit of the maggot-folk of Mordor; but south and now near loomed the great rampart of Cirith Gorgor, and the Black Gate amidmost, and the two Towers of the Teeth tall and dark upon either side. For in their last march the Captains had turned away from the old road as it bent east, and avoided the peril of the lurking hills, and so now they were approaching the Morannon from the northwest, even as Frodo had done.</div>

<div class="line_en">They advanced now slowly, expecting at every hour some answer to their challenge, and they drew together, since it was but waste of men to send out scouts or small parties from the main host. At nightfall of the fifth day of the march from Morgul Vale they made their last camp, and set fires about it of such dead wood and heath as they could find. They passed the hours of night in wakefulness and they were aware of many things half-seen that walked and prowled all about them, and they heard the howling of wolves. The wind had died and all the air seemed still. They could see little, for though it was cloudless and the waxing moon was four nights old, there were smokes and fumes that rose out of the earth and the white crescent was shrouded in the mists of Mordor.</div>

<div class="line_en">No choice was left them but to play their part to its end. Therefore Aragorn now set the host in such array as could best be contrived; and they were drawn up on two great hills of blasted stone and earth that orcs had piled in years of labour. Before them towards Mordor lay like a moat a great mire of reeking mud and foul-smelling pools. When all was ordered, the Captains rode forth towards the Black Gate with a great guard of horsemen and the banner and heralds and trumpeters. There was Gandalf as chief herald, and Aragorn with the sons of Elrond, and Éomer of Rohan, and Imrahil; and Legolas and Gimli and Peregrin were bidden to go also, so that all the enemies of Mordor should have a witness.</div>

They were come to the last end of their folly, and stood forlorn and chill in the grey light of early day before towers and walls which their army could not assault with hope, not even if it had brought thither engines of great power, and the Enemy had no more force than would suffice for the manning of the gate and wall alone. Yet they knew that all the hills and rocks about the Morannon were filled with hidden foes, and the shadowy defile beyond was bored and tunnelled by teeming broods of evil things. And as they stood they saw all the Nazgûl gathered together, hovering above the Towers of the Teeth like vultures; and they knew that they were watched. But still the Enemy made no sign.</div>

The rider was robed all in black, and black was his lofty helm; yet this was no Ringwraith but a living man. The Lieutenant of the Tower of Barad-dûr he was, and his name is remembered in no tale; for he himself had forgotten it, and he said: "I am the Mouth of Sauron." But it is told that he was a renegade, who came of the race of those that are named the Black Númenóreans; for they established their dwellings in Middle-earth during the years of Sauron's domination, and they worshipped him, being enamoured of evil knowledge. And he entered the service of the Dark Tower when it first rose again, and because of his cunning he grew ever higher in the Lord's favour; and he learned great sorcery, and knew much of the mind of Sauron; and he was more cruel than any orc.</div>

Taller and broader than Men they were, and they were clad only in close-fitting mesh of horny scales, or maybe that was their hideous hide; but they bore round bucklers huge and black and wielded heavy hammers in their knotted hands. Reckless they sprang into the pools and waded across, bellowing as they came. Like a storm they broke upon the line of the men of Gondor, and beat upon helm and head, and arm and shield, as smiths hewing the hot bending iron. At Pippin's side Beregond was stunned and overborne, and he fell; and the great troll-chief that smote him down bent over him, reaching out a clutching claw; for these fell creatures would bite the throats of those that they threw down.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在那一瞬间，敌人第一波攻势已经冲进他们的阵形之间。半兽人被山坡所阻挡，因此停下脚步对着守军射出箭矢；一大群山丘食人妖则是推开他们，从葛哥洛斯一路冲了过来，像是野兽一般狂吼。它们比人高、比人壮，身上只披着贴身的鳞甲，或许那是它们的皮肤也说不定。这些食人妖拿着大圆盾，挥舞着沉重的锤子，它们毫无所惧地冲进池水中，大吼着奔来。它们像是飓风一样打散了刚铎的防线，敲碎头盔和脑袋、砍断武器和盾牌，如同铁匠一样撼动整个原本毫无缝隙的防线。贝瑞贡被对方的一击震倒在地上，高大的食人妖酋长弯下腰，伸出手，准备将敌人的喉咙咬断。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He drew his sword and looked at it, and the intertwining shapes of red and gold; and the flowing characters of Númenor glinted like fire upon the blade. "This was made for just such an hour," he thought. "If only I could smite that foul Messenger with it, then almost I should draw level with old Merry. Well, I'll smite some of this beastly brood before the end. I wish I could see cool sunlight and green grass again!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他拔出宝剑，仔细观察着它，上面有金色和红色的刻痕，努曼诺尔人的文字像是火焰一般在剑刃上闪烁着。“这就是为了这个时刻所打造的，”他想：“真希望我能用这个东西杀死那可恶的信差，这样至少我勉强可以和梅里平起平坐了。好吧，在我死前会用这东西好好杀几个丑家伙，真希望未来还有机会可以看见阳光和绿草！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"So it ends as I guessed it would," his thought said, even as it fluttered away; and it laughed a little within him ere it fled, almost gay it seemed to be casting off at last all doubt and care and fear. And then even as it winged away into forgetfulness it heard voices, and they seemed to be crying in some forgotten world far above:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“原来就是这样结束的啊！”皮聘的思绪正缓缓的飘走，小小的意志甚至还开心地笑了笑，很高兴终于可以摆脱一切的疑惑、恐惧和忧虑。在他神智渐渐离体时，他听见自己的声音，彷佛是从别的世界传来的怪声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For one moment more Pippin's thought hovered. "Bilbo!" it said. "But no! That came in his tale, long long ago. This is my tale, and it is ended now. Good-bye!" And his thought fled far away and his eyes saw no more.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮聘的思绪又停留了片刻。“比尔博！”他想：“不！这是他故事里很久很久以前发生的事情。这是我的故事，它要结束啦！大家再见！”他闭上了眼睛，陷入黑暗中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then Pippin stabbed upwards, and the written blade of Westernesse pierced through the hide and went deep into the vitals of the troll, and his black blood came gushing out. He toppled forward and came crashing down like a falling rock, burying those beneath him. Blackness and stench and crushing pain came upon Pippin, and his mind fell away into a great darkness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="受到彻底忽略的皮聘猛地往上一刺，西方皇族打造的剑锋刺穿了食人妖坚硬的皮肤，深深刺进它的内脏，大量的黑血喷溅出来，恶臭、剧痛和黑暗笼罩了皮聘，他眼前的景象变得模糊不清。">查看中文翻译</div>
