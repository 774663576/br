<div class="line_en">I saw them first as small figures far below and took them for those others. "See down there, Horace," I said then. "Already they've found each other. Already they come, and as though that fellow took no wounds at all from Brennus."</div>

<div class="line_en">This cursed wind. Is this a storm before us? Horace will mind neither wind nor rain, only that a stranger sits astride him now and not his old master. "Just a weary woman," I tell him, "with greater need of the saddle than me. So carry her in good grace." Yet why is she here at all? Does Master Axl not see how frail she grows? Has he lost his mind to bring her to these unforgiving heights? But she presses on as determined as he, and nothing I say will turn them back. So I stagger here on foot, a hand on Horace's bridle, heaving this rusty coat. "Did we not always serve ladies with courtesy?" I murmur to Horace. "Would we ride on, leaving this good couple tugging at their goat?"</div>

<div class="line_en">And Horace looked my way thoughtfully, as though to ask, "Then, Gawain, will this be the last time we climb this bleak slope together?" And I gave no reply but to stroke gently his neck, though I thought to myself, "That warrior's young and a terrible fellow. Yet I may have the beating of him, who's to say? I saw something even as he brought down Brennus's man. Another would not see it, yet I did. A small opening on the left for a canny foe."</div>

<div class="line_en">But what would Arthur have me do now? His shadow still falls across the land and engulfs me. Would he have me crouch like a beast awaiting its prey? Yet where to hide on these bare slopes? Will the wind alone conceal a man? Or should I perch on some precipice and hurl down a boulder at them? Hardly the way for a knight of Arthur. I would rather show myself openly, greet him, try once more a little diplomacy. "Turn back, sir. You endanger not just yourself and your innocent companion, but all the good folk of this country. Leave Querig to one who knows her ways. You see me even now on my way to slay her." But such pleas were ignored before. Why would he hear me now he is come so close, and the bitten boy to guide him to her very door? Was I a fool to rescue that boy? Yet the abbot appals me so, and I know God will thank me for what I did.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，如果亚瑟在，现在会希望我怎么做呢？他的影子仍旧笼罩着这块土地，也包围着我。他会让我蹲伏下来，像野兽一样等待猎物吗？可这些山光秃秃的，能藏到哪儿呢？只有风，能把一个人遮住吗？也许，我该找个悬崖，守在上面朝他们扔石头？那可不是亚瑟王骑士的风范。我宁愿公开露面，迎上去，再游说一次试试看。“回去吧，先生。你不仅给你自己和年轻的伙伴带来了危险，还危及到了这个国家所有善良的人们。让一个了解魁瑞格的人来对付魁瑞格。你都看见啦，我这已经准备去杀她了。”但是，类似的请求，他之前并没有理会，现在为什么还要听呢？毕竟他已经到了附近，还有那个被咬过的男孩给他领路，直奔魁瑞格的老巢。救那个男孩，是不是个错误？但是院长真让我震惊，我知道上帝会因此感谢我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The copse. I remembered it then. Strange how the trees grow so lush there, when the wind sweeps all around so bare. The copse will provide covering for a knight and his horse. I will not pounce like a bandit, yet why show myself a good hour before the encounter?</div>

<div class="line_en">So I put a little spur on Horace, though it hardly makes an impression on him now, and we crossed the high edge of the land, neither rising nor falling, battered all the way by the wind. We were both thankful to reach those trees, even if they grow so strangely one wonders if Merlin himself cast a spell here. What a fellow was Master Merlin! I thought once he had placed a spell on Death himself, yet even Merlin has taken his path now. Is it heaven or hell he makes his home? Master Axl may believe Merlin a servant of the devil, yet his powers were often enough spent in ways to make God smile. And let it not be said he was without courage. Many times he showed himself to the falling arrows and wild axes alongside us. These may well be Merlin's woods, and made for this very purpose: that I may some day shelter here to await the one who would undo our great work of that day. Two of us five fell to the she-dragon, yet Master Merlin stood beside us, moving calmly within the sweep of Querig's tail, for how else could his work be done?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是我轻轻踢了霍拉斯一下，现在他对此已经没什么反应了，我们穿过了最高的山脊，那儿地面平坦、没有坡度，四面都是冽冽寒风。好不容易到了那树林中，我们俩都谢天谢地，不过那些树长得可真奇怪，让人怀疑是不是梅林亲自在这儿下了咒。梅林阁下真是个人物啊！有一度我以为他给死神都下了咒，可是，现在连梅林也上路啦。他现在住在天堂呢，还是地狱？埃克索阁下也许认为梅林是魔鬼的仆人，但是他却常常用他的本领，去做让上帝微笑的事。也不要说他没有勇气。很多次他和我们并肩战斗，面对飞矢和乱斧。这能算作是梅林的树林吧，长在这儿就为了一个目的：让我有一天能在此歇息，等待那个人，阻止他破坏我们那天成就的伟大事业。我们五个人，两个死在母龙手中，然而梅林阁下站在我们身边，在魁瑞格尾巴的扫击范围内镇定地走着，否则他的功夫怎么能施展呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The woods were hushed and peaceful when Horace and I reached them. Even a bird or two singing in the trees, and if the branches stirred wildly, down below was as a calm spring's day where at last an old man's thoughts may drift from one ear to the other without tossing in a tempest! It must be several years now since Horace and I were last in these woods. Weeds have grown monstrous here, a nettle rightly the spread of a small child's palm stands large enough to wrap around a man twice over. I left Horace at a gentle spot to chew on what he could, and wandered a while beneath the sheltering leaves. Why should I not rest here, leaning on this good oak? And when in time they come to this place, as they surely will, he and I will face each other as fellow warriors.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我和霍拉斯到的时候，树林里安静平和。甚至还有一两只鸟在树上唱着歌，虽然头顶上的树枝动个不停，但下面却安安静静，如同平和的春天；在这儿，一个老人终于可以定定神，慢慢理一理脑海里的思绪，而不会满脑子念头像暴风骤雨一样！我和霍拉斯上一次到这树林里来，该是好几年前了吧。地上的野草都长疯了，荨麻叶本来不过小孩手掌摊开那么大，现在却足以把一个成年人裹上两层。我把霍拉斯丢在一个开阔一点的地方，让他去找点儿吃的，自己到浓密的枝叶下走了一会儿。我为什么不歇息在这儿呢，靠着这棵漂亮的橡树？等他们来到这个地方——他们一定会来的，到那时候，我和他要会面啦，武士对武士。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I pushed through the giant nettles -- is it for this I have worn this creaking metal? To defend my shins from these feathery stings?-- until I reached the clearing and the pond, the grey sky above it peeping through. Around its rim, three great trees, yet each one cracked at the waist and fallen forward into the water. Surely they stood proudly when we were last here. Did lightning strike them? Or did they in weary old age long for the pond's succour, always so near where they grew, yet beyond reach? They drink all they wish now, and mountain birds nest in their broken spines. Will it be at such a spot I meet the Saxon? If he defeats me I may have life left to crawl to the water. I would not tumble in, even if the ice would admit me, for it would be no pleasure to grow bloated beneath this armour, and what chance Horace, missing his master, will come tip-toeing through the gnarled roots and drag out my remains? Yet I've seen comrades in battle yearn for water as they lie with their wounds, and watched yet others crawl to the edge of a river or lake, even though they double their agonies to do so. Is there some great secret known only to dying men? My old comrade, Master Buel, longed for water that day, as he lay on the red clay of that mountain. There's water here left in my gourd, I told him, but no, he demands a lake or river. But we're far from any such thing, I say. "Curse you, Gawain," he cries. "My last wish, will you not grant it, and we comrades through many bold battles?" "But this she-dragon's all but parted you in two," I tell him. "If I must carry you to water, I'll have to go under this summer sun, a separate part of you under each arm before we reach any such place." But he says to me, "My heart will welcome death only when you lay me down beside water, Gawain, where I hear its gentle lapping as my eyes close." He demands this, and cares not whether our errand is well done, or if his life is given at a good price. Only when I reach down to raise him does he ask: "Who else survives?" And I tell him Master Millus is fallen, yet three of us still stand, and Master Merlin too. And still he asks not if the errand is well finished, but talks of lakes and rivers, and now even of the sea, and it is all I can do to remember this is my old comrade, and a brave one, chosen like me by Arthur for this great task, even as a battle rages down in the valley. Does he forget his duty? I lift him, and he cries out to the heavens, and only then understands the cost even of a few small steps, and there we are, atop a red mountain in the summer heat, an hour's journey even on horseback to the river. And as I lower him he talks now only of the sea. His eyes blind now, when I sprinkle water on his face from my gourd, he thanks me the way I suppose in his mind's eye he stands upon a shore. "Was it sword or axe finished me?" he asks, and I say, "What do you talk of, comrade? It's the she-dragon's tail met you, but our task's done and you depart with pride and honour." "The she-dragon," he says. "What's become of the she-dragon?" "All but one of the spears rest in her flank," I say, "and now she sleeps." Yet he forgets the errand again, and talks of the sea, and of a boat he knew as a small boy when his father took him far from the shore on a kind evening.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我穿过巨大的荨麻——我穿着这咯吱作响的金属盔甲，难道是为了这个目的？让小腿不被这柔软的刺扎伤？——最后，我到了那片空地，还有那个池塘，头顶上露出了灰色的天空。周围有三棵大树，但每棵树都从腰间裂开，上半截栽在水里。我们上次来的时候，这些树还站得直挺挺的吧？被雷电击中了吗？或者是树太老了，渴望池塘的滋养？它们离水那么近，却又喝不到？现在，它们想怎么喝就能怎么喝啦，山上的鸟在它们破裂的树干上做了窝。我就要在这样的地方面对那个撒克逊人吗？如果被他打败，我也许还剩点儿力气，能爬到水边。就算那冰不拦着我，我也不愿意滚进水里，穿着这盔甲泡在水里发胀可不是开心的事情；还有霍拉斯呢，他会不会想念主人，小心翼翼跨过盘根错节的树根，把我的尸体拖上来？不过，我见过战场上的战友们，受伤了躺在那儿，渴望喝水；也亲眼见过一些人爬到河边或湖边，尽管这样做让他们备感痛苦。有没有某种大秘密，只有将死的人才知道？我的老战友，比埃尔阁下，那天躺在那座山的红土上，就渴望有水。我的葫芦里还有点水，我对他说，不是，他要的是湖或者河。但我们离得太远了，我说。“我诅咒你，高文，”他叫道。“这是我最后的心愿，你都不答应我，我们还是战友，一起打过那么多仗呢！”“可这母龙把你都撕成两半了，”我对他说。“如果要带你去水边的话，我就要在这夏天的日头下走，一条胳膊夹住你的一半身体，否则到不了那种地方。”可他对我说，“高文啊，我心里不会迎接死亡，除非你把我放在水边，我要听着水轻轻拍打的声音，慢慢闭上眼睛。”他一定要这么做，也不去管我们的任务有没有完成，他为此牺牲值不值得。我弯下腰去抱他的时候，他才问：“还有谁活下来了？”我告诉他，米勒斯阁下牺牲了，但有三个活着，还有梅林阁下。可他还是不问任务有没有完成，只是不停地谈河啊湖啊，甚至还说起了大海，我别的也做不了，只知道这是我的老战友，一位勇士，和我一样，被亚瑟选中来执行这项伟大的任务，虽然山谷里正在开战。他忘记自己的职责了吗？我把他抱起来，他喊得惊天动地，这时候才明白哪怕走几小步，都要付出巨大代价，我们就那样，站在红色的山上，在夏天的烈日下，就是骑马到最近的河也要一个小时。我把他放下来，那时候他嘴里只谈大海啦。他眼睛已经闭上了，我把葫芦里的水洒在他脸上，他感谢我，那样子让我觉得，在他心里，他已经站在了岸边。“结果我的，是剑哪，还是斧子？”他问。我说：“你这是说什么呢，战友？是母龙的尾巴打中了你，但是我们的任务完成了，你带着尊严与荣耀离开。”“母龙，”他说。“母龙怎么啦？”“除了一根之外，所有的矛全扎在她肋部，”我说，“现在她睡着了。”可他又忘了我们的任务，开始谈起大海来，说他小时候就有一条船，晚上如果平静，他父亲就带他到大海深处。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For a while we thought this might be our last, but I had mistaken this good couple for those others, and a while longer we travel in peace. Yet even as I lead Horace by the bridle, I must glance back, for surely they are coming, even if we go well ahead. Master Axl walks beside me, his goat forbidding him a steady step. Does he guess why I look back so often? "Sir Gawain, were we not comrades once?" I heard him ask it early this morning as we came out of the tunnel, and I told him to find a boat to go downstream. Yet here he is, still in the mountains, his good wife beside him. I will not meet his eye. Age cloaks us both, as the grass and weeds cloak the fields where we once fought and slaughtered. What is it you seek, sir? What is this goat you bring?</div>

<div class="line_en">When my own time comes, will I too long for the sea? I think I will be content enough with the soil. And I will not demand the exact spot, but let it be within this country Horace and I have spent the years roaming contentedly. Those dark widows of earlier would cackle to hear me, and hasten to remind me with what I may share my plot of earth. "Foolish knight! You above all need choose your resting place well, or find yourself a neighbour to the very ones you slaughtered!" Did they not make some such jest even as they threw mud at Horace's rump? How dare they! Were they there? Can it be this woman now rides in my saddle would say as much if she could hear my thoughts? She talked of slaughtered babes down in that foul-aired tunnel, even as I delivered her from the monks' black plans. How dare she?

<div class="line_en">"Turn back, friends," I said when they came upon me in the woods. "This is no walk for elderly travellers like you. And look how the good mistress holds her side. Between here and the giant's cairn there's still a mile or more, and the only shelter small rocks behind which one must curl with bowed head. Turn back while you still have strength, and I'll see this goat's left at the cairn and tethered well." But they both eyed me suspiciously, and Master Axl would not let go the goat. The branches rustled above, and his wife seated on the roots of an oak, gazing to the pond and the cracked trees stooping to water, and I said softly: "This is no journey for your good wife, sir. Why did you not do as I advised and take the river down out of these hills?" "We must take this goat where we promised," says Master Axl. "A promise made to a child." And does he look at me strangely as he says so, or do I dream it? "Horace and I will take the goat," I say. "Will you not trust us with the errand? I hardly believe this goat will much trouble Querig even if devoured whole, yet she may be a little slowed and lend me an advantage. So give me the creature and turn back down the mountain before one or the other of you fall in your own footsteps."</div>
