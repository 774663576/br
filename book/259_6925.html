<div class="line_en">Morrie laughed, then shook his head. The morning sun was coming through the window behind him, falling on the pink flowers of the hibiscus plant that sat on the sill. The quote was from Ted Turner, the billionaire media mogul, founder of CNN, who had been lamenting his inability to snatch up the CBS network in a corporate megadeal.</div>

<div class="line_en">I had brought the story to Morrie this morning because I wondered if Turner ever found himself in my old professor's position, his breath disappearing, his body turning to stone, his days being crossed off the calendar one by one -- would he really be crying over owning a network?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我今天早上把这条新闻告诉莫里是因为我突发奇想，要是特纳发觉自己处于莫里的境地，呼吸渐渐地衰竭，躯体慢慢地变成石头，日子一天天地从日历上划去——他还会为失去广播网而大恸大悲吗？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's all part of the same problem, Mitch," Morrie said. "We put our values in the wrong things. And it leads to very disillusioned lives. I think we should talk about that."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title='"这是同一个问题，米奇，"莫里说。"我们树立了错误的价值观，从而对生活产生了一种幻想破灭的失落感。我认为我们该谈谈这个问题。"'>查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Morrie was focused. There were good days and bad days now. He was having a good day. The night before, he had been entertained by a local a cappella group that had come to the house to perform, and he relayed the story excitedly, as if the Ink Spots themselves had dropped by for a visit. Morrie's love for music was strong even before he got sick, but now it was so intense, it moved him to tears. He would listen to opera sometimes at night, closing his eyes, riding along with the magnificent voices as they dipped and soared.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莫里的注意力集中起来。他现在时好时坏。今天的情况算是不错。前一天晚上，当地的一个清唱组合来为他作了表演，他异常兴奋他讲述着这件事，似乎上门来为他演唱的是黑斑组合。莫里患病前就十分喜爱音乐，如今这份爱好更强烈了，音乐会感动得他热泪盈眶。他有时在晚上听歌剧，闭上眼睛陶醉在激昂的歌声中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Morrie had always been taken with simple pleasures, singing, laughing, dancing. Now, more than ever, material things held little or no significance. When people die, you always hear the expression "You can't take it with you." Morrie seemed to know that a long time ago.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title='莫里一向很容易满足，唱歌，跳舞， 欢笑对他来说都是莫大的乐趣。如今，物质生活对他越来越无所谓了。人死的时候，人们常说"生不带来，死不带去"。莫里似乎早就明白了这个道理。'>查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Wherever I went in my life, I met people wanting to gobble up something new. Gobble up a new car. Gobble up a new piece of property. Gobble up the latest toy. And then they wanted to tell you about it. 'Guess what I got? Guess what I got?'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="&quot;无论我生活在哪里，我都会遇到一些对新的东西充满了占有欲的人，想拥有新的汽车， 想拥有新的财产，想拥有新的玩具。然后沾沾自喜地向你炫耀：'猜我得到了什么？猜我得到了什么？'">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We've got a form of brainwashing going on in our country," Morrie sighed. "Do you know how they brainwash people? They repeat something over and over. And that's what we do in this country. Owning things is good. More money is good. More property is good. More commercialism is good. More is good. More is good. We repeat it -- and have it repeated to us -- over and over until nobody bothers to even think otherwise. The average person is so fogged up by all this, he has no perspective on what's really important anymore.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title='"我们国家提倡灌输的教育形式，"莫里叹道。"你知道他们是怎样灌输的吗，他们对你一遍又一遍地重复，这就是我们国家的做法。拥有得越多越好。钱越多越好。财富越多越好。商业行为也是越多越好。越多越好。越多越好。我们反复地对别人这么说——别人又反复地对我们这么说——一遍又一遍，直到人人都认为这是真理。大多数人会受它迷惑而失去自己的判断能力。'>查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Money is not a substitute for tenderness, and power is not a substitute for tenderness. I can tell you, as I'm sitting here dying, when you most need it, neither money nor power will give you the feeling you're looking for, no matter how much of them you have."</div>

<div class="line_en">"You know how I always interpreted that? These were people so hungry for love that they were accepting substitutes. They were embracing material things and expecting a sort of hug back. But it never works. You can't substitute material things for love or for gentleness or for tenderness or for a sense of comradeship.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title='"你知道我对此是怎么解释的？这些人都渴望得到爱，但又得不到，于是就接受了这些替代品。他们乐于接受物质的东西，期望能得到类似于拥抱的感情回报，但这是行不通的。你无法用物质的东西去替代爱，善良、温柔或朋友间的亲情。'>查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I glanced around Morrie's study. It was the same today as it had been the first day I arrived. The books held their same places on the shelves. The papers cluttered the same old desk. The outside rooms had not been improved or upgraded. In fact, Morrie really hadn't bought anything new -- except medical equipment -- in a long, long time, maybe years. The day he learned that he was terminally ill was the day he lost interest in his purchasing power.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我环视莫里的书房。它同我第一次见到时的一模一样。书排放在书架的老地方。纸凌乱地堆满了那张；日的书桌。其它的房间也没有什么改善。事实上，莫里有很长时间，也许有好几年没有添置过新的东西——除了医疗器械。他得知自己患上不治之症的那一天，也就是他完全放弃购物欲的那一天。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"There's a big confusion in this country over what we want versus what we need," Morrie said. "You need food, you want a chocolate sundae. You have to be honest with yourself. You don't need the latest sports car, you don't need the biggest house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title='"这个社会在想要什么和需要什么这个问题上是很感困惑的，"莫里说。"你需要的是食物，而你想要的却是巧克力圣代。你得对自己诚实。你并不需要最新的跑车，你并不需要最大的房子。'>查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So the TV was the same old model, the car that Charlotte drove was the same old model, the dishes and the silverware and the towels -- all the same. And yet the house had changed so drastically. It had filled with love and teaching and communication. It had filled with friendship and family and honesty and tears. It had filled with colleagues and students and meditation teachers and therapists and nurses and a cappella groups. It had become, in a very real way, a wealthy home, even though Morrie's bank account was rapidly depleting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因此，电视机还是老牌子，夏洛特开的那辆车还是原来的型号，盘子、银器和毛巾——都是旧的。然而，这屋子却在发生重大的变化。它充满了爱。教诲和交流，它充满了友谊，柔情，但然和眼泪。它充满了同事，学生、默念师，治疗专家，护士和歌手。从真正的意义上说，它成了一个非常富有的家庭，尽管莫里银行帐户上的数字在急剧地减少。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I did this mostly because I didn't want him to see my eyes, to know what I was thinking, that I had been, for much of my life since graduation, pursuing these very things he had been railing against -- bigger toys, nicer house. Because I worked among rich and famous athletes, I convinced myself that my needs were realistic, my greed inconsequential compared to theirs.</div>
