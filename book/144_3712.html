<div class="line_en">By the time Cross reached the age of twenty-one, Pippi De Lena was impatient for Cross to follow his destiny. The most important fact in a man's life, conceded by all, was that he must make a living. He must earn his bread, put a roof over his head and clothes on his back, and feed the mouths of his children. To do that without unnecessary misery, a man had to have a certain degree of power in the world. It followed then, as night the day, that Cross must take his place in the Clericuzio Family. To do that, it was absolutely necessary he "make his bones."</div>

<div class="line_en">Cross had a good reputation in the Family. His answer to Dante when Dante told him that Pippi was a Hammer was quoted happily by Don Domenico himself, who savored the words almost with ecstasy. "I don't know that. You don't know that. Nobody knows that. Where did you get that fuckin' hat?" What an answer, the Don exclaimed with delight. So young a man to be so discreet, and so witty, what a credit to his father. We must give this boy his chance. All this had been related to Pippi, and so he knew the time was ripe.</div>

<div class="line_en">Pippi gave Cross a briefing on the Clericuzio Family. Their great war with the Santadio Family, which established their dominance. Pippi said nothing of his part in that war and was indeed scarce on details. Rather he praised Giorgio and Vincent and Petie. But most of all he praised Don Domenico for his farsightedness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="皮皮给克罗斯简单讲了克莱里库齐奥家族和桑塔迪奥家族的过节，以及奠定了他们家族地位的那次大战。皮皮完全没提他做了什么，对细节也含糊带过。但是他对乔治、文森特和佩蒂耶赞誉有加。不过最让他佩服的，要数唐·多梅尼科的高瞻远瞩。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He started to groom Cross. He sent him out on collection assignments that were difficult and required force. He discussed the old history of the Family and how operations were executed. Nothing fancy, he stressed. But when you had to get fancy, it must be planned in extreme detail. Simple was extreme simplicity. You sealed off a small geographic area and then you caught the target in that area. Surveillance first, then car and hit man, then blocking cars for any pursuers, then going to ground for a time afterward so that you could not be immediately questioned. That was simple. For fancy, you got fancy. You could dream up anything but you had to back it up with solid planning. You only got fancy when it was absolutely necessary.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Clericuzio had spun many webs, but its most extensive was gaming. It dominated all forms of casino and illegal gambling in the United States. It had a very subtle influence on the Native American casinos, it had a serious influence on sports betting, legal in Nevada and illegal in the rest of the country. The Family owned slot machine factories, had an interest in the manufacture of dice and cards, the supply of chinaware and silverware, the laundries for the gambling hotels. Gambling was the great jewel of their empire, and they ran a public relations campaign to make gambling legal in every state of the union.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克莱里库齐奥家族有许多生意网，覆盖最广的是博彩业。他们控制了美国所有的赌场和地下博彩，对美国土著赌场的影响力鲜为人知，他们直接控制着内华达合法的体育博彩和其他地区非法的体育博彩。家族开办了生产吃角子老虎机的工厂，在骰子和纸牌的制造业、赌场酒店的瓷器和银器供应、酒店洗衣业等等方面都有股份。博彩业是他们这个帝国最为璀璨的珠宝，他们不遗余力地在全国推行赌博合法化。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Legal gambling all over the United States by federal law was now the Holy Grail of the Clericuzio Family. Not only casinos and lotteries but also wagering on sports: baseball, football, basketball, and all others. Sports were holy in America, and once gambling was legalized that holiness would descend on gambling itself. The profits would be enormous.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如今，全美各地的合法赌博受到联邦法律保护，成了克莱里库齐奥家族的圣杯。不仅有赌场和乐透彩票，还有体育博彩：棒球、美式足球、篮球，应有尽有。体育在美国人心目中是神圣的，一旦赌博合法化，这种神圣也会扩散到体育博彩本身。到时候就有赚不完的钱。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Giorgio, whose company managed some of the state lotteries, had given the Family a breakdown on the expected numbers. A minimum of two billion dollars was bet on the Super Bowl all over the United States, most of it illegally. The sports books in Vegas, legal betting alone ran up over fifty million. The World Series, depending on how many games were played, totaled about another billion. Basketball was much smaller, but the many playoff games carried another billion, and this was not counting the everyday betting during the season.</div>

<div class="line_en">And the Clericuzio Family had the expertise and the political connections and pure force to control a great deal of this market.

<div class="line_en">The Family was also made rich with income from drugs, but only at a very high level, it was too risky. They controlled European processing, provided political protection and judicial intervention, and they laundered the money. Their position in drugs was legally impregnable and extremely profitable. They dropped the black money in a chain of banks in Europe and a few banks in the United States. The structure of the law was outflanked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="毒品也给家族带来了巨大收益，不过家族只参与毒品生意的最上游环节。风险太高了。他们控制了欧洲的加工环节、提供政治庇护和法律干预，还负责洗钱。他们的毒品生意丝毫没有法律漏洞。他们把钱分散地存在欧洲和美国，巧妙地避开法律的约束。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Once made legal, all this could be easily doubled or tripled with special lotteries and combination betting, except for the Super Bowl, whose increase would be tenfold and might even provide a net revenue for one day of $1 billion.

<div class="line_en">One of the most prized political assets of the Clericuzio Family was Walter Wavven, the governor of Nevada. He was a man in his early fifties, tall and lanky, who wore a cowboy hat but dressed in perfectly tailored suits. He was a handsome man and though married had a lusty appetite for the female sex. He also enjoyed good food and good drink, loved to bet sports, and was an enthusiastic casino gambler. He was too tender of public feelings to expose these traits, or to risk romantic seductions. So he relied on Alfred Gronevelt and the Xanadu Hotel to satisfy these appetites while preserving his political and personal image of the God-fearing, steadfast believer in old-fashioned family values.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="克莱里库齐奥家族最大的政治财富之一是内华达州长沃尔特·维文。他年届五十，高高瘦瘦，身上的西装剪裁得当，却戴着一顶牛仔帽。他面貌俊朗，虽然已经结婚，但对女性的热爱丝毫不减。他还喜欢美食和美酒，热衷体育博彩，是个狂热的赌徒。他极度在乎大众对他的印象，所以从来不会把这些特质暴露在公众面前，也不会冒险勾搭谁。所以，他就得靠格罗内韦尔特和桃源酒店满足他的需求，同时保持他那副敬事天主、恪守传统家庭价值观的个人政治形象。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But then, Pippi cautiously pointed out, despite all this there came times when risks had to be taken, when an iron fist must be shown. This the Family did with the utmost discretion and with terminal ferocity. And that was when you must earn the good life you led, when you truly earned your daily bread.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="这些别墅，是格罗内韦尔特最厉害的创作…">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Gronevelt had recognized Wavven's special gifts early on and provided the financial base that enabled Wavven to climb the political ladder. When Wavven became governor of Nevada and wanted a relaxing weekend, Gronevelt gave him one of the prized Villas.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="格罗内韦尔特早就认识到了维文的特别天赋，于是资助他在仕途上一路高升。维文成为内华达州长之后，想要有个放松的周末。格罗内韦尔特便把其中一套豪华别墅给了他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Gronevelt had come to Vegas early, when it was still basically a western cowboy gambling town, and he had studied gambling and gamblers as a brilliant scientist might study an insect important to evolution. The one great mystery that would never be solved was why very rich men still wasted time gambling to win money they did not need. Gronevelt decided they did so to hide other vices, or they desired to conquer fate itself, but more than anything it was to show some sort of superiority to their fellow creatures. Therefore he reasoned that when they gambled they should be treated as gods. They would gamble as the gods gambled or the kings of France in Versailles.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="格罗内韦尔特来到了拉斯维加斯的时候，这里只算是个西部牛仔的赌博窝点。他研究赌博，研究赌博的人，就好像科学家们研究对进化意义重大的昆虫。有个问题始终让他百思不得其解，那些已经很有钱了的人，为什么还要浪费那么多时间要赢钱呢，他们根本用不着那么多钱啊。格罗内韦尔特推断，他们这么干，也许是为了掩盖其他罪行，也许是因为他们乐于征服命运，但最有可能的解释是，他们只是希望能炫耀一下相比于同类的优越感而已。因此他得出结论，他们在赌博的时候，需要别人把他们当成神。他们赌钱的派头，要表现得好像是众神来赌钱了，或者是凡尔赛宫里的法国国王前来下注。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So Gronevelt spent $100 million to build seven luxurious Villas and a special jewel-box casino on the grounds of the Xanadu Hotel (with his usual foresight he had bought much more land than the Xanadu needed). These Villas were small palaces, each could sleep six couples in six separate apartments, not merely suites. The furnishings were lavish: hand-woven rugs, marble floors, gold bathrooms, rich fabrics on the walls; dining rooms and kitchens staffed by the Hotel. The latest audiovisual equipment turned living rooms into theaters. The bars of these Villas were stocked with the finest wines and liquors and a box of illegal Havana cigars. Each Villa had its own outdoor swimming pool and inside Jacuzzi. All free to the gambler.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因此，格罗内韦尔特斥资一亿建造了七幢豪华别墅，又在桃源酒店的首层修造了美轮美奂的赌场（由于他一贯的远见卓识，他早就买下了比桃源酒店所需大得多的土地）。这些别墅不仅有套房，还有六间公寓可以容纳十二个人。装修极尽奢华之能事：手织地毯、大理石地面、金碧辉煌的洗手间、墙上挂着织锦。餐厅和厨房的人员都是由酒店配备的，最先进的声像设备让客厅变成了家庭剧场。别墅的小吧台里藏有极品红酒和各种烈酒，还有一匣走私进来的哈瓦那雪茄。每幢别墅都有独立的室外游泳池，室内有水流按摩浴缸。一律免费。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the special security area that held the Villas was the small oval casino called the Pearl, where the high rollers could play in privacy and where the minimum bet in baccarat was a thousand dollars. The chips in this casino were also different, the black one-hundred-dollar chip was the lowest denominator; the five hundred, pale white threaded with gold; a gold-barred blue chip for the thousand; and the specially designed ten-thousand-dollar chip, with a real diamond embedded in the center of its gold surface. However, as a concession to the ladies, the roulette wheel would change hundred-dollar chips into five-dollar chips.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一片配备了专门的保安人员的区域连接了各栋别墅。这是一个小型的椭圆形赌场，叫作“珍珠赌坊”，赌场大亨们可以在此享受私人包间。这里的百家乐，每次最小的赌注也要一千美元。这座赌坊的筹码也与众不同。黑色的一百美元筹码在这里是最小面值，金边灰白筹码价值五百美元，金边的蓝色筹码是一千美元，而一万美元的筹码用黄金特殊加工而成，中间还嵌了一颗真正的钻石。不过，为了女宾们的方便，轮盘区可以把一百美元的筹码换成五美元的筹码。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was amazing that enormously wealthy men and women would take this bait. Gronevelt figured that all these extravagant RFB comps ran the Hotel fifty thousand dollars a week on the cost sheet. But these were written off on tax reports. Plus the prices of everything were inflated on paper. Figures (he kept a separate accounting) showed that each Villa made an average profit of a million dollars a week. The very fancy restaurants that served the Villas' and other important guests also made a profit as tax write-offs. On the cost sheets, a dinner for four totaled over a thousand dollars, which since the guests were comped, was written off as business expense for that amount in taxes. Since the meal cost the Hotel no more than a hundred dollars counting labor, there was a profit right there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="慕名而来的有钱人多得不可思议。格罗内韦尔特算了一笔账，这些免费房间、酒水、食物的奢侈享受，每周都要花上酒店五万美元，不过这些成本都可以抵税，而且每样东西的价钱都有所夸大。数据显示（他还有本单独的账），每幢别墅平均每周可以带来一百万美元的利润。为别墅和其他重要来宾提供膳食的高级餐馆也是一个减税条目。成本清单上，四个人一顿晚餐要花一千美元以上，但是餐饮是免费提供的，所以算作经营成本，可以从税额里除去。其实这样的一顿饭连工带料也就需要一百美元，利润空间自然就出现了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Of course there was a little more. These were Villas where important public men could bring their mistresses or boyfriends, where they could gamble in anonymity. And strange to say there were many titans of business, men worth hundreds of millions of dollars, even with wives and mistresses, who were lonely. Lonely for carefree feminine company, for women of exceptional sympathy. And for these men, the Villas would be furnished by Gronevelt with the proper beauty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，还不止如此。各界要人也可以将情妇或者男友一并带到这些别墅来，更可以匿名下注。奇怪的是，许多商业巨头，尽管身家以亿万计，有妻子情人，还是感到孤独。他们独自一人，希望不必有任何顾忌地找个女伴，或者找个格外有同情心的女人。对于这样的人，格罗内韦尔特一定会送去符合他们心意的女人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And so, to Gronevelt, the seven Villas were like seven crowns that he bestowed on the heads of only those gamblers who risked or made a Drop of over a million dollars on their two- or three-day stay.

And they had to be prompt in paying their markers or they would be relegated to one of the suites in the Hotel itself, which, however plush, were not comparable to the Villas.</div>

He had dark good looks, he came from a family of Catholics who worked in Detroit's auto factories and, with a poet's alliterative wit, always swore he would rather fuck than fit a fender. Despite this he worked part-time jobs to pay his tuition. He took himself very seriously, but this was mitigated by the fact that he had talent.</div>

<div class="line_en">Perhaps Theo had detected their condescension; the governor and his wife had both been extra friendly, extra courteous, determined to honor their daughter's choice, while privately deploring so unsuitable a match. The mother was not worried; she knew Theo's charm would fade with her daughter's growth. The father was uneasy but tried to make up for it with a more-than-common affability, even for a politician. After all, the governor was a champion of the working class, per his political platform, the mother was an educated liberal. A romance with Theo could only give Marcy a broader view of life. Meanwhile Marcy and Theo were living together, and planned to get married after they graduated. Theo would write and perform his plays, Marcy would be his muse and a professor of literature.</div>

<div class="line_en">The next day, before dawn, to escape the heat of the desert, they drove from Las Vegas to Los Angeles. Driving across the desert, Pippi told Cross to relax. Cross was mesmerized by the glorious sunrise that seemed to melt the desert sand into a deep river of gold lapping at the foot of the distant Sierra Nevadas. He felt anxious. He wanted to get the job done.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="为了避开沙漠的酷热，第二天破晓前，他们就驱车从拉斯维加斯赶到洛杉矶。车子在沙漠里穿行时，皮皮告诉克罗斯放松。沙漠中的日出胜景让克罗斯目眩神迷。初升的太阳仿佛要把沙漠熔化成一条金色的河流，蜿蜒流淌，绵延到遥远的内华达山脉之下。他感到了一丝焦虑，他想要赶紧把事办妥。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They had eleven hours to kill before the operation started at midnight. The other men, ignoring a huge TV set, started a card game on the sundeck; they were all in bathing suits. Pippi smiled at Cross and said, "Shit, I forgot about the swimming pool."</div>

<div class="line_en">After the meal, Pippi took Cross on a reconnaissance in the stolen car. They drove to the western-style restaurant and coffee shop farther down the Pacific Coast Highway where they would find Theo. The surveillance reports showed that on Wednesday nights Theo, on his way to Oxnard, had made a habit of stopping at the Pacific Coast Highway Restaurant at around midnight for coffee and ham and eggs. That he would leave about one in the morning. That night a surveillance team of two men would be tailing him and would report by telephone when he was on the way.</div>

<div class="line_en">Cross and Pippi sat on the sundeck waiting for the phone call. There were five cars in the driveway, all black, shining in the moonlight like bugs. The six men from the Enclave continued their card game, playing with silver coins: nickels, dimes, and quarters. Finally at eleven-thirty the phone call came: Theo was on his way from Brentwood to the restaurant. The six men got in three cars and drove away to take up their appointed posts. Pippi and Cross got into the stolen car and waited another fifteen minutes before they left. Cross had in the pocket of his jacket a small.22 pistol, which, though it had no silencer, only gave off a sharp little pop; Pippi carried a Glock that would make a loud report. Ever since his only arrest for murder, Pippi always refused to carry a silencer.</div>

Detectives would question the help about all the customers. The surveillance team had reported what Theo was wearing, the car he was driving, the license plates.

<div class="line_en">Then they were surprised. Theo, instead of going to his car, walked across the Pacific Coast Highway, dodging traffic. On the other side, he strolled out onto the open beach to the very edge, daring the waves. He stood there gazing at the ocean, the yellow moon setting on the horizon so far away. Then he turned and came back across the highway and into the parking lot. He had let the waves reach him, and there was the squish of water in his fashionable boots.</div>

<div class="line_en">Cross slowly got out of the car. Theo was almost on him. Cross waited for Theo to go past, then smiled politely to let Theo get into his car. When Theo was inside, Cross drew the gun. Theo, about to put his key into the ignition, his car window down, raised his eyes, aware of the shadow. At the moment Cross fired, they looked into each other's eyes. Theo was frozen as the bullet smashed into his face, which instantly became a mask of blood, the eyes staring out. Cross yanked open the door and fired two more bullets into the top of Theo's head. Blood sprayed into his face. Then he threw a pouch of drugs on the floor of Theo's car. He slammed the door shut. Pippi had started up the motor of his car just as Cross fired. Now he opened the car door, and Cross hopped in. According to plan he had not dropped the pistol. That would have made it look like a planned hit instead of a drug deal gone sour.</div>

<div class="line_en">Cross saw the figure emerging from the restaurant, caught in the glow of the door lights. He was struck by the boyishness of the figure, slight and short, a shock of curly hair above the pale, thin face. Theo looked too frail to be a murderer.</div>

The primary evidence of this was that Cross was given a percentage of the income of the gambling books, legal and illegal, in Las Vegas.

<div class="line_en">By the age of twenty-five, Cross was known in the Clericuzio Family as the Little Hammer. He himself found it curious that he was so cold about his work. His targets were never people he knew. They were lumps of flesh enclosed in defenseless skin; the skeleton beneath gave them the outline of wild animals he had hunted with his father when he was a boy. He did fear the risk but only cerebrally; there was no physical anxiety. There were moments in his life's repose, sometimes when he awoke in the morning with a vague terror as if he had some terrible nightmare.

At his trial, witnesses would perjure themselves in his behalf, jurors could be approached with bribes. Even after he had served a few years, a new case would be prepared, presenting new evidence, showing that he was innocent. There was one famous case in which the Clericuzio had done such a thing after one of their clients had served five years.

<div class="line_en">No, Ballazzo had no fear of prison. What made him turn traitor was that the Federal Government threatened to seize all his worldly goods under the RICO laws passed by Congress to crush crime. Ballazzo could not bear that he and his children would lose their palatial home in New Jersey, the luxurious condo in Florida, the horse farm in Kentucky that had produced three also-rans in the Kentucky Derby. For the infamous RICO laws permitted the government to seize all worldly goods of those arrested for criminal conspiracy. The stocks and bonds, the antique cars might be taken. Don Clericuzio himself had been angered by the RICO laws, but his only comment was "the rich will rue this thing, the day will come when they will arrest the whole of Wall Street under this RICO law."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不，巴拉佐并不怕坐牢。让他成为叛徒的真正原因是，联邦政府威胁他说，根据国会颁布的“反黑法”，要没收他的全部家当。要从他和孩子们的手中夺走新泽西那幢富丽堂皇的房子，佛罗里达的奢华公寓，肯塔基的马场，他可受不了这个，虽然马场培养出的三匹马在肯塔基州马赛中都输掉了，那也不行。一旦谁涉嫌密谋犯罪而被捕，这部臭名昭著的“反黑法”就允许联邦政府没收他的所有财产。股票、债券、老爷车，都会被夺走。对于反黑法，唐·克莱里库齐奥本人也火冒三丈，但他也只是说了一句——“富人们这是搬起石头砸自己的脚。有了这个反黑法，总有一天他们会把整个华尔街的人全抓起来的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A Family conference was held: Don Clericuzio; his three sons, Giorgio, Vincent, and Petie; and Pippi De Lena. It was true that Ballazzo could damage the Family structure, but only the lower levels would suffer greatly. The traitor could give valuable information but no legal proof. Giorgio suggested that if worse came to worst, they could always set up headquarters in a foreign country, but the Don dismissed this angrily. Where else could they live but in America? America had made them rich, America was the most powerful country in the world and protected its rich. The Don often quoted the saying, "Rather a hundred guilty men go free than one innocent man be punished," then added, "What a beautiful country." The trouble was that everyone got soft because of such good living. In Sicily Ballazzo would never have dared become a traitor, would never even have dreamed of breaking the law of omerta. His own sons would have killed him.</div>

There was a Family Bruglione in Louisiana, another in Chicago, and another in Tampa, who flaunted their wealth, who showed off their power for all the world to see. And then the secafoni when they were caught sought to escape the punishment they had earned by their own carelessness. By breaking the law of omerta. By betraying their fellows.

He would willingly go to jail if the government promised not to invoke the RICO laws, if his wife and children could keep his fortune.

That's not to my taste but more important you never can tell when it might lead to danger, every minute might count.

He never wore one of his peculiar hats, he took her on walks around the estate, took her out for dinner. He waited on her like some eighteenth-century French gallant.

<div class="line_cn" title="“当然，”乔治说，“我一直忍受着。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Giorgio was astonished by this outburst. He was also made wary by its truth. "You're wrong about the Don, he cares about you just as much. The same with Petie, Vincent, and me. Have we ever not treated you with the respect of family? Sure, the Don is a little remote but the man is very old. As for me, I'm just giving you a caution for your own safety. You're in a very dangerous business, you have to be careful. You cannot let personal emotions in. That's disaster."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对这突如其来的爆发，乔治瞠目结舌。而且他说的都是真的，这让他感到很不安。“你错怪唐了。他还是一样在乎你。佩蒂耶、文森特和我也是。我们什么时候没把你当成一家人过？当然，唐是有点儿疏远。但是他年纪都那么大了。至于我，我只是提醒你，这是为了你个人的安全。这一行很危险，你必须小心。你不能把个人感情放进去。否则那简直就是灾难。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"No," Giorgio said. Which was another lie. Vincent had also spoken to Giorgio about Dante. Petie had not, but Petie was a born assassin. Yet he, too, had shown a distaste for Dante's company.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不知道。”乔治说。这也是撒谎。关于丹特，文森特也早就跟乔治谈过。佩蒂耶没有。虽然佩蒂耶天生就是个杀手，但是他也不愿意跟丹特在一起。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No," Giorgio said, "and don't be so tough about this. I'm advising you as your uncle. But I'm telling you from my place in the Family. You do not anymore make anybody do their Communion or Confirmation without the Family OK. Got it?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Giorgio had one great virtue. He spoke his mind when he really wanted to, even to his father, the great Don himself. "He talked too much to his mother. And he has bad blood." They were both silent for a time after this.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="乔治还有一个好品质。只要他愿意，就可以完全坦白，就连对他父亲也是如此。“他跟他妈妈谈得太多了。他的性子太狠。”说罢，二人沉默良久。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He frowned and said to Giorgio, "Soon you will have my responsibilities. Remember always that the task is that the Clericuzio must one day stand with society, that the Family must never die. No matter how hard the choice."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他皱了皱眉头，对乔治说：“很快，你就要挑起我的担子了。永远记住，我们的任务是有一天让克莱里库齐奥家族从地下走到地上。家族必须永远传承下去。不管这个选择有多艰难，都要坚持。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Despite everything, I think Pippi should retire," the Don said. "Dante must have his chance to be foremost, after all he is a Clericuzio. Pippi will be an advisor to his son's Bruglione in the West. If necessary he can always advise Dante. There is no one better versed in those matters. As he proved with the Santadio.
