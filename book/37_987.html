<div class="line_en">Aziraphale was particularly proud of his magical skills. He had attended a class in the 1870s run by John Maskelyne, and had spent almost a year practicing sleight of hand, palming coins, and taking rabbits out of hats. He had got, he had felt at the time, quite good at it. The point was that although Aziraphale was capable of doing things that could make the entire Magic Circle hand in their wands, he never applied what might be called his intrinsic powers to the practice of sleight-of-hand conjuring. Which was a major drawback. He was beginning to wish that he'd continued practicing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="亚茨拉菲尔特别欣赏自己的魔术技巧。他曾在十九世纪七十年代参加过手技魔术巨匠约翰·马斯基林的一个培训班，还花了整整一年时间练习魔术手技、硬币戏法和从帽子里变兔子。他当时觉得自己精于此道。亚茨拉菲尔能办到的事，足以令整个英国魔法师协会俯首称臣，但他从来不肯在变戏法时运用自己与生俱来的能力。这是极大的障碍。他此刻已经开始希望自己一直有在练习。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There were people who called themselves Satanists who made Crowley squirm. It wasn't just the things they did, it was the way they blamed it all on Hell. They'd come up with some stomach-churning idea that no demon could have thought of in a thousand years, some dark and mindless unpleasantness that only a fully-functioning human brain could conceive, then shout "The Devil Made Me Do It" and get the sympathy of the court when the whole point was that the Devil hardly ever made anyone do anything. He didn't have to. That was what some humans found hard to understand. Hell wasn't a major reservoir of evil, any more than Heaven, in Crowley's opinion, was a fountain of goodness; they were just sides in the great cosmic chess game. Where you found the real McCoy, the real grace and the real heart-stopping evil, was right inside the human mind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些自称撒旦信徒的家伙，让克鲁利局促不安。不光是因为他们所做的事，更是因为他们把一切都怪在地狱头上。他们想出的点子，恶魔们花一千年都摸不着边。这些让人浑身发冷的主意，充满黑暗和龌龊的气息，只有功能正常的人类大脑才能孕育出来。然后这些人会大叫着“是恶魔让我这么干的”，以得到陪审团的同情。但问题在于，恶魔几乎不会让任何人做任何事。他没这个必要。有些人就是无法理解这一点。在克鲁利看来，地狱并非邪恶的蓄水池，天堂也不是仁慈的喷泉。它们只是宇宙大棋局的两个玩家。你只能在人类的头脑中找到货真价实的玩意儿，无论是纯粹的仁慈，还是彻底的邪恶。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Besides, some of the old-style Satanists tended, in fact, to be quite nice people. They mouthed the words and went through the motions, just like the people they thought of as their opposite numbers, and then went home and lived lives of mild unassuming mediocrity for the rest of the week with never an unusually evil thought in their heads.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="再说了，有些老派撒旦信徒其实都是大好人。他们咏颂祷词、举行仪式，其实跟自己的假想敌们没什么区别。仪式结束后，他们回到家中，继续谦逊温和的平凡人生。一周余下的日子里，可能连半个邪恶念头都没有。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Besides, they were always so depressingly enthusiastic. Take all that stuff with the inverted crosses and pentagrams and cockerels. It mystified most demons. It wasn't the least bit necessary. All you needed to become a Satanist was an effort of will. You could be one all your life without ever knowing what a pentagram was, without ever seeing a dead cockerel other than as Chicken Marengo.</div>

She'd stopped reading the kind of women's magazine that talks about romance and knitting and started reading the kind of women's magazine that talks about orgasms, but apart from making a mental note to have one if ever the occasion presented itself she dismissed them as only romance and knitting in a new form.

Not, as he thought when she walked back into the shop, to have a plug put on it, but because it didn't have a 387 coprocessor. That bit he understood -- he was a dealer, after all, and could understand quite long words -- but after that the conversation rapidly went downhill from his point of view. Mary Hodges produced yet more magazines. Most of them had the term "PC" somewhere in their title, and many of them had articles and reviews that she had circled carefully in red ink.</div>

<div class="line_en">She finished the drink, hefted the sword over one shoulder, and looked around at the puzzled factions, who now encircled her completely. "Sorry to run out on you, chaps," she said. "Would love to stay and get to know you better."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她喝光残酒，把剑扛在肩上，环视三派人马迷惑的表情。这些人把她团团围住。“抱歉，失陪了，伙计们。”朱伊季勃说，“真希望能留下来，跟你们认识一下。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She examined it. It was a very straightforward sword, long and sharp; it looked both old and unused; and it had nothing ornamental or impressive about it. This was no magical sword, no mystic weapon of power and might. It was very obviously a sword created to slice, chop, cut, preferably kill, but, failing that, irreparably maim, a very large number of people indeed. It had an indefinable aura of hatred and menace.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她上下检查一番。这是柄很普通的剑，又长又利；看起来相当古老，但又似乎从未用过；没有任何装饰，也不漂亮；不是魔法剑，不具备任何神秘力量。它显然是一柄用来切、砍、削的长剑，特别适合杀死——如果未能成功，至少也是致残——数目庞大的人群。从上到下都散发着不可名状的恨意和威胁。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Red finished opening the parcel. People began to edge around to get a better look. Inside the package was a large sword.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="朱伊季勃打开包裹。人们都在往前挤，想要看个清楚。包裹里是一柄长剑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Red clasped the hilt in her exquisitely manicured right hand, and held it up to eye level. The blade glinted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="朱伊季勃用精心保养的右手握住剑柄，举到与双眼平齐。剑锋闪着寒光。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Awwwright!" she said, stepping down from the stool. "Finally."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好得很！”她说着从吧凳上站起身，“终于到时候了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The men in the room suddenly realized that they didn't want to know her better. She was beautiful, but she was beautiful in the way a forest fire was beautiful: something to be admired from a distance, not up close.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="屋子里的人突然意识到自己不想认识她。她很美，但这种美就像山林大火，可远观不可亵玩。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She licked a spatter of blood -- someone else's -- from the back of her hand with a scarlet, cat-like tongue. Then she smiled.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她用猫咪似的深红色舌头，舔掉手背上的一点血迹——别人的血迹，然后露出微笑。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"This wouldn't of happened if we'd of gone to Torremolinos like we usually do," said one of them, plaintively.</div>

<div class="line_en">And she walked out of the bar, her heels clicking on the tiles like the tapping of distant hammers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她走出酒吧，鞋跟敲打在瓷砖上发出咚咚声响，仿佛遥远的战鼓。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There were a number of guns in that room, and slowly, tremblingly, they were focused on her chest, and her back, and head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="酒吧里有不少枪，它们都慢慢地、颤颤巍巍地瞄准了朱伊季勃的前胸、后背和脑袋。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Red shrugged. She began to walk forward.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“别动！”彼得挤出一句话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Every finger on every trigger tightened, almost of its own accord. Lead and the smell of cordite filled the air. Red's cocktail glass smashed in her hand. The room's remaining mirrors exploded in lethal shards. Part of the ceiling fell down.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每个扳机上的每根手指，几乎同时扣下。到处都是铅弹和无烟火药味。朱伊季勃的鸡尾酒杯在她掌中破碎。屋子里剩下的镜子都被炸成致命的碎片。部分天花板掉了下来。">查看中文翻译</div>
