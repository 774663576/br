<div class="line_en">Ove did his best not to like any of it. But Sonja got so worked up about it all that in the end it inevitably affected him too. She laughed so loudly when he held her that he felt it through his whole body. Not even Ove could avoid liking it.</div>

<div class="line_en">Of course, the bus tour was her idea. Ove couldn't see the use of it. If they had to go anywhere, why not just take the Saab? But Sonja insisted that buses were "romantic," and that sort of thing was incredibly important, Ove had learned. So that's how it ended up. Even though everyone in Spain seemed to think they were somehow exceptional because they went around yawning and drinking and playing foreign music in restaurants and going to bed in the middle of the day.</div>

<div class="line_en">They stayed in a little hotel, with a little pool, and a little restaurant run by a man whose name, as Ove understood it, was Schosse. It was spelled "José" but it seemed people weren't too particular about pronunciation in Spain. Schosse couldn't speak any Swedish but he was very interested in speaking anyway. Sonja had a little book in which she looked things up, so she could say things like "sunset" and "ham" in Spanish. Ove felt it didn't stop being the butt end of a pig just because you said it another way, but he never mentioned this.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们住在一家小旅馆，里面有个小泳池和一家小饭馆，欧维以为经营旅馆的小个子男人叫“赊债”。但写出来却是“何塞”，西班牙人对发音显然不怎么讲究，欧维想。“赊债”一点瑞典语都不会说，但对聊天兴致盎然。索雅一遍遍地查字典，想用西班牙语说“日落”和“火腿”。欧维心想，你怎么说不都还是一摊猪屁股，但他没吱声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ove occupied himself by going for walks. He took the road leading past the hotel into the village. All the houses were made of stone, he noted. Many of them didn't appear to have thresholds under their front doors, and there were no decent window seals to be seen. Ove thought it slightly barbaric. One couldn't bloody build houses like this.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维趁这时散个步。他从旅馆出发，沿路向下进城。他注意到，所有的房子都是石头建的。眼前没有一根像样的窗框，大多数房子门口根本没有门槛。欧维觉得这有些不开化。怎么能他妈这么造房子？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On the other hand he tried to point out to her that she shouldn't give money to the beggars in the street, as they'd only buy schnapps with it. But she kept doing it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="另外，他提醒她别给街上的乞丐钱，因为他们肯定都拿去买烧酒了，但她还是照给不误。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Ove protested she just smiled and took his big hands in hers and kissed them, explaining that when a person gives to another person it's not just the receiver who's blessed. It's the giver.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维想反驳，她只是笑着亲亲他那双大手。“欧维，当一个人给另一个人钱，蒙福的不是那个收钱的人，而是给钱的那个。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On the third day she went to bed in the middle of the day. Because that was what people did in Spain, she said, and one should adopt the "local customs of a place." Ove suspected it was not so much about customs as her own preferences, and this suited her very well as an excuse. She already slept sixteen hours out of twenty-four since she got pregnant.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第三天她就开始睡午觉。因为西班牙人都这么做，她说，大家应该“入乡随俗”。欧维才不信这跟哪儿哪儿的风俗有什么关系，只是她的借口罢了。反正，她怀孕后，二十四小时内都得睡上十六个小时，就像带了条小狗来度假。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Hospital!" Schosse shouted again and pointed at the old woman in the car. In fact, she didn't look in very good shape, Ove reaffirmed to himself. Schosse pointed to the woman and pointed under the hood at the smoking engine, repeating despairingly, "Hospital! Hospital!" Ove cast his evaluating eye on the spectacle and finally drew the conclusion that this smoking, Spanish-manufactured car must be known as a "hospital."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“医院！”‘赊债’指着车里的老女人喊。她看上去确实很不舒服，欧维又确认了一下。“赊债”指指女人，又指指冒着烟的发动机盖，绝望地高喊“医院！医院！”欧维审时度势了一番，得出结论，这辆冒着烟的西班牙国产车的牌子叫“医院”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was on his way back to the hotel when he saw Schosse leaning over a smoking brown car at the side of the road. Inside sat two children and a very old woman with a shawl around her head. She didn't seem to be feeling very well.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="回旅馆的路上，他看见“赊债”弯腰倚在一辆冒着烟停靠在路边的棕色小汽车上。车里坐着两个孩子和一个很老的老太太，老太太头上裹着一条披巾，看上去不怎么舒服。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Schosse caught sight of Ove and waved at him in an agitated manner with something almost like panic in his eyes. "Sennjaur," he called out to Ove, the way he'd done every time he'd spoken to him since their arrival. Ove assumed it meant "Ove" in Spanish, but he hadn't checked Sonja's phrase book so carefully. Schosse pointed at the car and gesticulated wildly at Ove again. Ove stuck his hands into his trouser pockets and stopped at a safe distance, with a watchful look on his face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“赊债”看到欧维，立刻朝他挥起手来，眼里似乎满是恐慌。“犀牛”，他这么称呼欧维。入住以来，每次与欧维见面聊天，他都这么叫。欧维猜这在西班牙语里大概指的是自己的名字，他没工夫查索雅的字典。“赊债”往汽车上一通指，又冲欧维打手势，欧维把手插进裤兜，在适当的距离迟疑着停下脚步。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Schosse stared in puzzlement at him for a moment. Then he pointed at himself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“赊债”困惑地瞪了他一会儿，然后也指着自己。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ove didn't know what he was expected to say to that; clearly the whole matter of car makes was considered quite important in Spain, and certainly Ove could empathize with that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="欧维不知道他应该作何回答，但显然，在西班牙，汽车品牌是件很重要的事，这一点欧维倒是完全认可的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He leaned over the engine and peered down. It didn't look so complicated, he thought.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他把头探过引擎盖向内张望，看上去并不复杂，他想。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Hospital," Schosse said again and nodded several times and looked quite worried.</div>

<div class="line_en">"I wasn't bloody asking for your name, I was only sayi --" Ove started saying, but he stopped himself when he was met on the other side of the hood by a stare as glazed as an inland lake.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我他妈又没问你的名字，我只是说……”欧维说，但看到引擎盖对面那湖水般空洞的眼神后，他没再往下说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Obviously this Schosse's grasp of Swedish was even worse than Ove's Spanish. Ove sighed and looked with some concern at the children in the backseat. They were holding the old woman's hands and looked quite terrified. Ove looked down at the engine again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“赊债”懂的瑞典语显然比欧维懂的西班牙语还少。欧维叹了口气，挺不好意思地看看后座上的孩子。他们握着老阿姨的手，看上去吓坏了。欧维又低头看看发动机。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Her daily naps and Ove's walks became a ritual. On the second day, Ove walked past a man putting up a fence, and stopped to explain that this was absolutely the wrong way to do it. The man couldn't understand a word of what he was saying, so Ove decided in the end that it would be quicker to show him how. On the third day he built a new exterior wall on a church building, with the assistance of the village priest. On the fourth day he went with Schosse to a field outside the village, where he helped one of Schosse's friends pull out a horse that had got stuck in a muddy ditch.</div>

<div class="line_en">On the bus on the way home from Spain she put Ove's hand on her belly and he felt the child kicking -- faintly, as if someone had prodded the palm of his hand through a very thick oven mitt. They sat there for several hours feeling the little bumps. Ove didn't say anything but Sonja saw the way he wiped his eyes with the back of his hand when he rose from his seat and mumbled something about needing the bathroom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从西班牙回家的大巴上，她把欧维的手放在自己肚子上，他第一次感觉到孩子在蹬腿。很轻很轻，就像有人隔着很厚的烤箱手套捅他的掌心。他们一坐就是几个小时，感觉着这隐约的小力量。欧维什么也没说，但索雅看见，他最后起身嘟囔说得上厕所的时候，用手背擦拭了一下眼睛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was destined to be followed by the very unhappiest.</div>

<div class="line_en">Many years later it occurred to Sonja to ask him about all that. When Ove at last told her, she shook her head both long and hard. "So while I was sleeping you sneaked out and helped people in need… and mended their fences? People can say whatever they like about you, Ove. But you're the strangest superhero I ever heard about."</div>
