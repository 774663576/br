<div class="line_en">Suddenly there was a great shout, and down from the Dike came those who had been driven back into the Deep. There came Gamling the Old, and Éomer son of Éomund, and beside them walked Gimli the dwarf. He had no helm, and about his head was a linen band stained with blood; but his voice was loud and strong. "Forty-two, Master Legolas!" he cried. "Alas! My axe is notched: the forty-second had an iron collar on his neck. How is it with you?"</div>

<div class="line_en">So it was that in the light of a fair morning King Théoden and Gandalf the White Rider met again upon the green grass beside the Deeping-stream. There was also Aragorn son of Arathorn, and Legolas the Elf, and Erkenbrand of Westfold, and the lords of the Golden House. About them were gathered the Rohirrim, the Riders of the Mark: wonder overcame their joy in victory, and their eyes were turned towards the wood.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="甘道夫哈哈大笑：“你们是指那些树吗？”他说：“不，我眼中的森林和诸位眼中的是一样的，那可不是我的功劳，这是超越了贤者思虑的奇迹，比我的计谋还要好；从结果来看，甚至超越了我原先的预料呢！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The King then chose men that were unhurt and had swift horses, and he sent them forth with tidings of the victory into every vale of the Mark; and they bore his summons also, bidding all men, young and old, to come in haste to Edoras. There the Lord of the Mark would hold an assembly of all that could bear arms, on the third day after the full moon. To ride with him to Isengard the King chose Éomer and twenty men of his household. With Gandalf would go Aragorn, and Legolas, and Gimli. In spite of his hurt the dwarf would not stay behind.</div>

<div class="line_en">The sun was already drawing near the hills upon the west of the Coomb, when at last Théoden and Gandalf and their companions rode down from the Dike. Behind them were gathered a great host, both of the Riders and of the people of Westfold, old and young, women and children, who had come out from the caves. A song of victory they sang with clear voices; and then they fell silent, wondering what would chance, for their eyes were on the trees and they feared them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="太阳已经渐渐的靠近附近的山顶，甘道夫和希优顿以及同行的伙伴们这才开始进发。骠骑和西谷的人民不管老弱妇孺，都聚集在身后送行，他们吟唱着雄壮的战歌，最后沉默下来，担忧地看着那些树林，不知道接下来会发生什么事情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Riders came to the wood, and they halted; horse and man, they were unwilling to pass in. The trees were grey and menacing, and a shadow or a mist was about them. The ends of their long sweeping boughs hung down like searching fingers, their roots stood up from the ground like the limbs of strange monsters, and dark caverns opened beneath them. But Gandalf went forward, leading the company, and where the road from the Hornburg met the trees they saw now an opening like an arched gate under mighty boughs; and through it Gandalf passed, and they followed him. Then to their amazement they found that the road ran on, and the Deeping-stream beside it; and the sky was open above and full of golden light. But on either side the great aisles of the wood were already wrapped in dusk, stretching away into impenetrable shadows; and there they heard the creaking and groaning of boughs, and far cries, and a rumour of wordless voices, murmuring angrily. No Orc or other living creature could be seen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="骑士们来到森林边，人马都一起停了下来，他们都不愿意贸然进入。树木看来泛灰，有种咄咄逼人的感觉，四周弥漫着一层雾气和黯影。它们摇摆的枝丫伸出，如同搜寻敌人的手指，底下的根部则蠢蠢欲动的扬起，好象某种不知名怪物的触角一般，触角底下还有着幽深的黑色洞穴，但甘道夫还是领着队伍头也不回地往前走。原先的道路在和森林会合的地方出现了一个开口，甘道夫走了进去，其它的人也跟在后面。他们惊讶地发现这条路竟然一直延伸下去，旁边有着深溪，头顶还看得见金黄色的天空。即使如此，两旁的树木似乎已经被包围在自己的浓荫当中，在无法穿透的黑影中窃窃私语；他们可以听见枝丫摇动的嘎吱声和远方的呼喊，以及飘移不定的诡异声响，似乎都蕴含着无比的怒气，没有任何半兽人或是其它生物的踪迹。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"And, Legolas, when the torches are kindled and men walk on the sandy floors under the echoing domes, ah! then, Legolas, gems and crystals and veins of precious ore glint in the polished walls; and the light glows through folded marbles, shell-like, translucent as the living hands of Queen Galadriel. There are columns of white and saffron and dawn-rose, Legolas, fluted and twisted into dreamlike forms; they spring up from many-coloured floors to meet the glistening pendants of the roof: wings, ropes, curtains fine as frozen clouds; spears, banners, pinnacles of suspended palaces! Still lakes mirror them: a glimmering world looks up from dark pools covered with clear glass; cities, such as the mind of Durin could scarce have imagined in his sleep, stretch on through avenues and pillared courts, on into the dark recesses where no light can come. And plink! a silver drop falls, and the round wrinkles in the glass make all the towers bend and waver like weeds and corals in a grotto of the sea. Then evening comes: they fade and twinkle out; the torches pass on into another chamber and another dream. There is chamber after chamber, Legolas; hall opening out of hall, dome after dome, stair beyond stair; and still the winding paths lead on into the mountains' heart. Caves! The Caverns of Helm's Deep! Happy was the chance that drove me there! It makes me weep to leave them."</div>

None of Durin's race would mine those caves for stones or ore, not if diamonds and gold could be got there. Do you cut down groves of blossoming trees in the springtime for firewood? We would tend these glades of flowering stone, not quarry them. With cautious skill, tap by tap -- a small chip of rock and no more, perhaps, in a whole anxious day -- so we could work, and as the years went by, we should open up new ways, and display far chambers that are still dark, glimpsed only as a void beyond fissures in the rock. And lights, Legolas! We should make lights, such lamps as once shone in Khazad-dûm; and when we wished we would drive away the night that has lain there since the hills were made; and when we desired rest, we would let the night return."</div>

As tall as trolls they were, twelve feet or more in height; their strong bodies, stout as young trees, seemed to be clad with raiment or with hide of close-fitting grey and brown. Their limbs were long, and their hands had many fingers; their hair was stiff, and their beards grey-green as moss. They gazed out with solemn eyes, but they were not looking at the riders: their eyes were bent northwards. Suddenly they lifted their long hands to their mouths, and sent forth ringing calls, clear as notes of a horn, but more musical and various. The calls were answered; and turning again, the riders saw other creatures of the same kind approaching, striding through the grass. They came swiftly from the North, walking like wading herons in their gait, but not in their speed; for their legs in their long paces beat quicker than the heron's wings. The riders cried aloud in wonder, and some set their hands upon their sword-hilts.</div>

There are children in your land who, out of the twisted threads of story, could pick the answer to your question.

They have now followed your marshal, Elfhelm. I sent him with many Riders to Edoras. Saruman I knew had despatched his full strength against you, and his servants had turned aside from all other errands and gone to Helm's Deep: the lands seemed empty of enemies; yet I feared that wolf-riders and plunderers might ride nonetheless to Meduseld, while it was undefended.

<div class="line_en">There was an ancient highway that ran down from Isengard to the crossings. For some way it took its course beside the river, bending with it east and then north; but at the last it turned away and went straight towards the gates of Isengard; and these were under the mountain-side in the west of the valley, sixteen miles or more from its mouth. This road they followed but they did not ride upon it; for the ground beside it was firm and level, covered for many miles about with short springing turf. They rode now more swiftly, and by midnight the Fords were nearly five leagues behind. Then they halted, ending their night's journey, for the King was weary. They were come to the feet of the Misty Mountains, and the long arms of Nan Curunír stretched down to meet them. Dark lay the vale before them, for the moon had passed into the West, and its light was hidden by the hills. But out of the deep shadow of the dale rose a vast spire of smoke and vapour; as it mounted, it caught the rays of the sinking moon, and spread in shimmering billows, black and silver, over the starry sky.</div>

But in the morning they went out and were amazed; for the slain Orcs were gone, and the trees also. Far down into the valley of the Deep the grass was crushed and trampled brown, as if giant herdsmen had pastured great droves of cattle there; but a mile below the Dike a huge pit had been delved in the earth, and over it stones were piled into a hill. Men believed that the Orcs whom they had slain were buried there; but whether those who had fled into the wood were with them, none could say, for no man ever set foot upon that hill. The Death Down it was afterwards called, and no grass would grow there. But the strange trees were never seen in Deeping-coomb again; they had returned at night, and had gone far away to the dark dales of Fangorn. Thus they were revenged upon the Orcs.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was not so now. Beneath the walls of Isengard there still were acres tilled by the slaves of Saruman; but most of the valley had become a wilderness of weeds and thorns. Brambles trailed upon the ground, or clambering over bush and bank, made shaggy caves where small beasts housed. No trees grew there; but among the rank grasses could still be seen the burned and axe-hewn stumps of ancient groves. It was a sad country, silent now but for the stony noise of quick waters. Smokes and steams drifted in sullen clouds and lurked in the hollows. The riders did not speak. Many doubted in their hearts, wondering to what dismal end their journey led.</div>

<div class="line_en">At dawn they made ready to go on. The light came grey and pale, and they did not see the rising of the sun. The air above was heavy with fog, and a reek lay on the land about them. They went slowly, riding now upon the highway. It was broad and hard, and well-tended. Dimly through the mists they could descry the long arm of the mountains rising on their left. They had passed into Nan Curunír, the Wizard's Vale. That was a sheltered valley, open only to the South. Once it had been fair and green, and through it the Isen flowed, already deep and strong before it found the plains; for it was fed by many springs and lesser streams among the rain-washed hills, and all about it there had lain a pleasant, fertile land.</div>

Deep gutters, filled with trickling water, ran down on either side. Suddenly a tall pillar loomed up before them. It was black; and set upon it was a great stone, carved and painted in the likeness of a long White Hand. Its finger pointed north. Not far now they knew that the gates of Isengard must stand, and their hearts were heavy; but their eyes could not pierce the mists ahead.</div>

<div class="line_en">This was its fashion, while Saruman was at his height, accounted by many the chief of Wizards. A great ring-wall of stone, like towering cliffs, stood out from the shelter of the mountain-side, from which it ran and then returned again. One entrance only was there made in it, a great arch delved in the southern wall. Here through the black rock a long tunnel had been hewn, closed at either end with mighty doors of iron. They were so wrought and poised upon their huge hinges, posts of steel driven into the living stone, that when unbarred they could be moved with a light thrust of the arms, noiselessly. One who passed in and came at length out of the echoing tunnel, beheld a plain, a great circle, somewhat hollowed like a vast shallow bowl: a mile it measured from rim to rim. Once it had been green and filled with avenues, and groves of fruitful trees, watered by streams that flowed from the mountains to a lake. But no green thing grew there in the latter days of Saruman. The roads were paved with stone-flags, dark and hard; and beside their borders instead of trees there marched long lines of pillars, some of marble, some of copper and of iron, joined by heavy chains.</div>

<div class="line_en">Many houses there were, chambers, halls, and passages, cut and tunnelled back into the walls upon their inner side, so that all the open circle was overlooked by countless windows and dark doors. Thousands could dwell there, workers, servants, slaves, and warriors with great store of arms; wolves were fed and stabled in deep dens beneath. The plain, too, was bored and delved. Shafts were driven deep into the ground; their upper ends were covered by low mounds and domes of stone, so that in the moonlight the Ring of Isengard looked like a graveyard of unquiet dead. For the ground trembled. The shafts ran down by many slopes and spiral stairs to caverns far under; there Saruman had treasuries, store-houses, armouries, smithies, and great furnaces. Iron wheels revolved there endlessly, and hammers thudded. At night plumes of vapour steamed from the vents, lit from beneath with red light, or blue, or venomous green.</div>

<div class="line_en">To the centre all the roads ran between their chains. There stood a tower of marvellous shape. It was fashioned by the builders of old, who smoothed the Ring of Isengard, and yet it seemed a thing not made by the craft of Men, but riven from the bones of the earth in the ancient torment of the hills. A peak and isle of rock it was, black and gleaming hard: four mighty piers of many-sided stone were welded into one, but near the summit they opened into gaping horns, their pinnacles sharp as the points of spears, keen-edged as knives. Between them was a narrow space, and there upon a floor of polished stone, written with strange signs, a man might stand five hundred feet above the plain. This was Orthanc, the citadel of Saruman, the name of which had (by design or chance) a twofold meaning; for in the Elvish speech orthanc signifies Mount Fang, but in the language of the Mark of old the Cunning Mind.</div>

But before the king could speak, the small smoke-breathing figure became suddenly aware of them, as they sat there silent on the edge of the mist. He sprang to his feet. A young man he looked, or like one, though not much more than half a man in height; his head of brown curling hair was uncovered, but he was clad in a travel-stained cloak of the same hue and shape as the companions of Gandalf had worn when they rode to Edoras.

One seemed asleep; the other, with crossed legs and arms behind his head, leaned back against a broken rock and sent from his mouth long wisps and little rings of thin blue smoke.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="国王和所有的部下全都一言不发地坐在马上，惊讶地明白萨鲁曼已经被推翻了。但他们想破头也猜不出来是怎么办到的。当众人转过头看着破烂不堪的拱门和饱经蹂躏的铁门时，突然注意到一堆瓦砾上躺着两个小小的身影。这两个生物穿着灰色的外衣，在瓦砾中几乎让人无法发现，他们四周有许多的锅碗瓢盆，可能刚刚才大吃大喝了一顿，现在正把握机会休息。一个人似乎睡着了，另一个则是双手交迭在后脑上，好整以暇地翘着二郎腿，靠着大石仰望天空，嘴里冒出一个又一个的烟圈。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"No, good sir, the matter escaped him," answered Merry gravely. "He has been much occupied. Our orders came from Treebeard, who has taken over the management of Isengard. He commanded me to welcome the Lord of Rohan with fitting words. I have done my best."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，大人，他没想到这一点，”梅里神情凝重地回答：“他太忙碌了，我们的命令是来自接管艾辛格的树胡。他命令在下必须要用最适当的言词欢迎洛汗的国王，我已经尽力了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Welcome, my lords, to Isengard!" he said. "We are the doorwardens. Meriadoc, son of Saradoc is my name; and my companion, who, alas! is overcome with weariness' -- here he gave the other a dig with his foot -- "is Peregrin, son of Paladin, of the House of Took. Far in the North is our home. The Lord Saruman is within; but at the moment he is closeted with one Wormtongue, or doubtless he would be here to welcome such honourable guests."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“欢迎大人们来到艾辛格！”他说：“我们是这里的看门人，在下梅里雅达克，是沙拉达克之子；而我的同伴，啊，恐怕已经在休息了！”说到这里，他踢了那名同伴一脚，“他是皮瑞格林，图克家族的帕拉丁之子，我们的故乡在遥远的北方。萨鲁曼大人还在里面，不过，他目前正和巧言被困在里面，否则，我想他一定会前来欢迎诸位这么尊贵的客人！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"And what about your companions? What about Legolas and me?" cried Gimli, unable to contain himself longer. "You rascals, you woolly-footed and wool-pated truants! A fine hunt you have led us! Two hundred leagues, through fen and forest, battle and death, to rescue you! And here we find you feasting and idling -- and smoking! Smoking! Where did you come by the weed, you villains? Hammer and tongs! I am so torn between rage and joy, that if I do not burst, it will be a marvel!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那你又是怎么对待我们这些一起共患难的朋友？勒苟拉斯和我又怎么办？”金雳再也忍不住了，不禁大吼道：“你这个家伙，你这个毛毛脚，全身长毛、好吃懒做的家伙！你们害我们跑了多远知道吗？整整六百哩！从草原到森林，经历战斗和死亡，都只为了救你们！在我们做牛做马东奔西跑之后，你们竟然还在这边大吃大喝，而且还──抽烟！抽烟！你们这些坏蛋，烟草是哪里来的？天哪，我又高兴又生气，如果我不发泄一下，实在会受不了啊！”">查看中文翻译</div>

I have wandered in many lands, since I left my home, and never till now have I found people that knew any story concerning hobbits."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="梅里再度鞠躬，皮聘跳了起来，也跟着深深一鞠躬：“王上，您太客气了，我希望您是真心的，”他说：“我也遇到了另一个奇迹！自从我离家之后已经见识过了许多国度，但之前从来没有任何人听过哈比人的事情。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"One thing you have not found in your hunting, and that's brighter wits," said Pippin, opening an eye. "Here you find us sitting on a field of victory, amid the plunder of armies, and you wonder how we came by a few well-earned comforts!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你们追了这么久，有一样东西没找到，那就是更聪明的脑子，”皮聘张开一只眼说：“你们发现我们坐在胜利的战场上，在兵荒马乱之后的废墟中，竟然还问我们，怎么有资格好好休息！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"My people came out of the North long ago," said Théoden. "But I will not deceive you: we know no tales about hobbits. All that is said among us is that far away, over many hills and rivers, live the halfling folk that dwell in holes in sand-dunes. But there are no legends of their deeds, for it is said that they do little, and avoid the sight of men, being able to vanish in a twinkling; and they can change their voices to resemble the piping of birds. But it seems that more could be said."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我族是许久以前离开北方的居民，”希优顿说：“但我不想骗你们，我们知道的其实并不多。我们只知道在很远的地方，越过许多山脉和河流，有一群矮小的生物居住在洞穴或是沙丘中。但没有任何关于他们的传说，因为据说他们游手好闲，躲避人类的目光，可以在一瞬间消失，而且他们还可以将嗓音伪装成飞鸟的啁啾声。不过，看来似乎并不只是这样。”">查看中文翻译</div>

"These hobbits will sit on the edge of ruin and discuss the pleasures of the table, or the small doings of their fathers, grandfathers, and great-grandfathers, and remoter cousins to the ninth degree, if you encourage them with undue patience. Some other time would be more fitting for the history of smoking. Where is Treebeard, Merry?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"That is not surprising," answered Merry; "for it is an art which we have not practised for more than a few generations.

Far away came a hoom-hom, as of horns blowing triumphantly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我相信他应该是在北边吧，他想去喝点干净的水。大多数的树人都和他一起走了，他们还在那边忙碌地工作着。”梅里对着冒烟的湖泊挥舞着手，当众人转头看去时，他们听见什么东西崩塌的声音，似乎山崩了一样，更远的地方则是传来轰轰，呼姆的声音，似乎有人正吹响着胜利的号角。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There is the water," said Merry. "But Quickbeam and some others are watching it. Not all those posts and pillars in the plain are of Saruman's planting. Quickbeam, I think, is by the rock, near the foot of the stair."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“有这些水就够了，”梅里说：“不过，快枝和其它的树人其实还在警戒中，水里面的柱子其实不完全是萨鲁曼的杰作。我想，快枝就在那个阶梯附近的巨岩旁。”">查看中文翻译</div>
