Apollo, the god of the oracle, spoke through his priestess Pythia, who sat on a stool over a fissure in the earth, from which arose hypnotic vapors that put Pythia in a trance. This enabled her to be Apollo's mouthpiece. When people came to Delphi they had to present their question to the priests of the oracle, who passed it on to Pythia. Her answer would be so obscure or ambiguous that the priests would have to interpret it. In that way, the ieople got the benefit of Apollo's wisdom, believing that e knew everything, even about the future.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Greeks had many stories of people whose destiny catches up with them. As time went by, a number of plays -- tragedies -- were written about these "tragic" people. The most famous one is the tragedy of King Oedipus.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="希腊有许多故事叙述人们如何逃不过命运的捉弄。久而久之，这些“可怜”人物的故事被写成若干出悲剧。其中最有名的一出是有关伊迪帕斯国王的悲惨故事。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But Fate did not just govern the lives of individuals. The Greeks believed that even world history was governed by Fate, and that the fortunes of war could be swayed by the intervention of the gods. Today there are still many people who believe that God or some other mysterious power is steering the course of history.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="古希腊人相信命运不仅操纵个人的生活，也左右世界的历史。他们并且相信战争的结局可能因诸神的介入而改变。同样的，在我们这个时代，也有许多人相信上帝或某种神秘的力量会影响历史的走向。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There were many heads of state who dared not go to war or take other decisive steps until they had consulted the oracle at Delphi. The priests of Apollo thus functioned more or less as diplomats, or advisers. They were experts with an intimate knowledge of the people and the country.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当时，有许多国家元首要等到求教于戴尔菲的神谕后，才敢打仗或采取一些决定性的步骤。因此阿波罗的祭司们或多或少具有一些外交家的功能，也可以说他们是熟悉人民与国家事务的顾问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Over the entrance to the temple at Delphi was a famous inscription: KNOW THYSELF! It reminded visitors that man must never believe himself to be more than mortal -- and that no man can escape his destiny.</div>

<div class="line_en">But at the same time as Greek philosophers were trying to find natural explanations for the processes of nature, the first historians were beginning to search for natural explanations for the course of history. When a country lost a war, the vengeance of the gods was no longer an acceptable explanation to them. The best known Greek historians were Herodotus (484-424 B. C.) and Thucydides (460-400 B. C.).</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，就在希腊哲学家努力为大自然的变化寻求符合自然的解释时，历史上最早的一批历史学家也开始为历史事件寻求合理的解释。他们不再认为一个国家之所以打败仗是因为神向他们报复。最著名的两位希腊历史学家是贺若多陀斯（Herodotus，公元前484年～公元前424年）与修西德底斯（Thucydides，公元前46O～公元前4OO年）。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This idea was in no way unique to the Greeks. Before the development of modern medicine, the most widely accepted view was that sickness was due to supernatural causes. The word "influenza" actually means a malign influence from the stars.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个观念并非希腊人独有。在现代医学发达以前，人们普遍认为疾病是由某些超自然的原因所造成。英文influenza（流行性感冒）一词实际上的意思是“受到星星的不良影响”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Greeks also believed that sickness could be ascribed to divine intervention. On the other hand, the gods could make people well again if they made the appropriate sacrifices.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="古希腊人相信疾病可能是神降的灾祸，也相信只要人以适当的方式向神献祭，神就可能使生病的人痊愈。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Even today, there are a lot of people who believe that some diseases -- AIDS, for example -- are God's punishment. Many also believe that sick people can be cured with the help of the supernatural.</div>

<div class="line_en">The most essential safeguards against sickness, according to the Hippocratic medical tradition, were moderation and a healthy lifestyle. Health is the natural condition. When sickness occurs, it is a sign that Nature has gone off course because of physical or mental imbalance. The road to health for everyone is through moderation, harmony, and a "sound mind in a sound body."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="根据希波克拉底派的医学传统，要预防疾病，最重要的就是饮食起居要节制，同时要有健康的生活方式。他们认为健康是人的自然状态。人之所以生病，是因为身体或心灵不平衡，因而使大自然“出轨”所致。保持健康的方法就是节制饮食、保持和谐，并拥有“健康的身体与健康的心灵”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There is a lot of talk today about "medical ethics," which is another way of saying that a doctor must practice medicine according to certain ethical rules. For instance, a doctor may not give healthy people a prescription for narcotics. A doctor must also maintain professional secrecy, which means that he is not allowed to reveal anything a patient has told him about his illness. These ideas go back to Hippocrates. He required his pupils to take the following oath:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现代人常常谈到“医学伦理”，也就是说医生为人治病时必须遵守若干伦理规范，例如不能开麻醉药品的处方给健康人，同时必须保守职业上的秘密，也就是说，不可以泄漏病人的病情。这些概念都是希波克拉底提出来的。他要求他的学生宣读下列的誓言：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Concurrently with the new directions in Greek philosophy, a Greek medical science arose which tried to find natural explanations for sickness and health. The founder of Greek medicine is said to have been Hippocrates, who was born on the island of Cos around 460 B. C.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在希腊哲学朝新方向迈进之际，希腊的医学也开始兴起。这种学问的目的是为疾病与健康寻求合乎自然的解释。据说希腊医学的始祖是大约公元前46O年时，在寇斯岛诞生的希波克拉底（Hipocrates）。">查看中文翻译</div>
