The June rise used to be always luck for me; because as soon as that rise begins here comes cordwood floating down, and pieces of log rafts – sometimes a dozen logs together; so all you have to do is to catch them and sell them to the wood-yards and the sawmill.</div>

<div class="line_en">I went along up the bank with one eye out for pap and t'other one out for what the rise might fetch along. Well, all at once here comes a canoe; just a beauty, too, about thirteen or fourteen foot long, riding high like a duck. I shot head-first off of the bank like a frog, clothes and all on, and struck out for the canoe. I just expected there'd be somebody laying down in it, because people often done that to fool folks, and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it they'd raise up and laugh at him. But it warn't so this time. It was a drift-canoe sure enough, and I clumb in and paddled her ashore. Thinks I, the old man will be glad when he sees this – she's worth ten dollars. But when I got to shore pap wasn't in sight yet, and as I was running her into a little creek like a gully, all hung over with vines and willows, I struck another idea: I judged I'd hide her good, and then, 'stead of taking to the woods when I run off, I'd go down the river about fifty mile and camp in one place for good, and not have such a rough time tramping on foot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我往河岸上走去，一只眼睛留意着爸爸，另一只眼睛留心看这回涨水能捞到些什么。啊，但见一只独木小舟，看起来多么漂漂亮亮的，长十三、四英尺，浮在水上面活象一只鸭子。我象一只青蛙一般，从岸上纵身一跃，身上的衣服还全都没有脱，朝独木小舟游去。我料想，会有人躺在船身里，因为人家往往喜欢这么作弄人，只等有人把船划近，他就直起身来，把人家取笑一顿。可是这一回倒不是这样。这是一只漂来的无主的独木小舟，肯定是如此，我爬上了这独木小舟，划到了岸边。我心想，老头子一见到，准定会高兴——这小舟能值十块大洋。不过我一上岸，不见爸爸的影子。我把小舟划到了一条类似溪沟的小河浜里，水面上挂满了藤萝和柳条，这时我心生一计。我断定，小舟我能藏好，不会有差错，等我出逃时，不必钻树林子了，不妨下到下游五十英里开外的去处，挑一个地方露营扎寨，免得靠双脚走，搞得累死累活的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">While we laid off after breakfast to sleep up, both of us being about wore out, I got to thinking that if I could fix up some way to keep pap and the widow from trying to follow me, it would be a certainer thing than trusting to luck to get far enough off before they missed me; you see, all kinds of things might happen.

<div class="line_en">About twelve o'clock we turned out and went along up the bank. The river was coming up pretty fast, and lots of driftwood going by on the rise. By and by along comes part of a log raft – nine logs fast together. We went out with the skiff and towed it ashore. Then we had dinner. Anybody but pap would a waited and seen the day through, so as to catch more stuff; but that warn't pap's style. Nine logs was enough for one time; he must shove right over to town and sell. So he locked me in and took the skiff, and started off towing the raft about halfpast three. I judged he wouldn't come back that night. I waited till I reckoned he had got a good start; then I out with my saw, and went to work on that log again. Before he was t'other side of the river I was out of the hole; him and his raft was just a speck on the water away off yonder.</div>

<div class="line_en">I had wore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and dragging out so many things. So I fixed that as good as I could from the outside by scattering dust on the place, which covered up the smoothness and the sawdust. Then I fixed the piece of log back into its place, and put two rocks under it and one against it to hold it there, for it was bent up at that place and didn't quite touch ground. If you stood four or five foot away and didn't know it was sawed, you wouldn't never notice it; and besides, this was the back of the cabin, and it warn't likely anybody would go fooling around there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我从洞洞里爬出来，又拖出了这么多的东西，把地面磨平得相当厉害。因此我就从外面用心收拾了一下，在那里撒些尘土，把磨平的地方用锯屑给盖住了。接下来把那段木头放回原处，在木头下面垫上了两块石头，另外搬一块顶住那节木头，不让它坠下来——因为木头正是在这儿有点儿弯，并不贴着地面。你要是站在四五步外，不会知道这节木头是锯过了的。再说，这是在木屋的背后，没有人会到那儿去转游。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the canoe was hid, and shoved the vines and branches apart and put it in; then I done the same with the side of bacon; then the whisky-jug.

I took fish-lines and matches and other things – everything that was worth a cent. I cleaned out the place.

<div class="line_en">I took the axe and smashed in the door. I beat it and hacked it considerable a-doing it. I fetched the pig in, and took him back nearly to the table and hacked into his throat with the axe, and laid him down on the ground to bleed; I say ground because it was ground – hard packed, and no boards. Well, next I took an old sack and put a lot of big rocks in it – all I could drag – and I started it from the pig, and dragged it to the door and through the woods down to the river and dumped it in, and down it sunk, out of sight. You could easy see that something had been dragged over the ground. I did wish Tom Sawyer was there; I knowed he would take an interest in this kind of business, and throw in the fancy touches. Nobody could spread himself like Tom Sawyer in such a thing as that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我拿起了斧头，砸开了门——我又劈又砍，使了好大劲，才成功了。我把猪拖了进去，拖到了离桌子不远之处，一斧头砍进了猪的喉咙口，把它放在地上流血——我这里说的是地上，因为这确实是地面上。是夯结实的地面，没有铺木板。好啊，下一步呢，我拿来了一只旧的麻袋，往里面放进了不少大的石头——能拖来多少就拖多少——就从猪身子旁边开始，拖着口袋，拖到门口，推进林子，拖到河边，扔进河里，口袋就沉了下去，不见踪影。你一眼便可看出，在这里，有什么东西在地面上给拖过了的。我但愿汤姆·索亚能在这里。我知道，他对这类玩意儿肯定会兴趣十足，搞出些异想天开的点子来。在这方面，没有人赶得上汤姆·索亚那么内行。">查看中文翻译</div>

So I took the gun and went up a piece into the woods, and was hunting around for some birds when I see a wild pig; hogs soon went wild in them bottoms after they had got away from the prairie farms. I shot this fellow and took him into camp.</div>

<div class="line_en">Well, last I pulled out some of my hair, and blooded the axe good, and stuck it on the back side, and slung the axe in the corner. Then I took up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket (so he couldn't drip) till I got a good piece below the house and then dumped him into the river. Now I thought of something else. So I went and got the bag of meal and my old saw out of the canoe, and fetched them to the house. I took the bag to where it used to stand, and ripped a hole in the bottom of it with the saw, for there warn't no knives and forks on the place – pap done everything with his clasp-knife about the cooking. Then I carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and through the willows east of the house, to a shallow lake that was five mile wide and full of rushes – and ducks too, you might say, in the season. There was a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that went miles away, I don't know where, but it didn't go to the river. The meal sifted out and made a little track all the way to the lake. I dropped pap's whetstone there too, so as to look like it had been done by accident. Then I tied up the rip in the meal sack with a string, so it wouldn't leak no more, and took it and my saw to the canoe again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="啊，最后呢，我拔了我的几根头发，在斧头上涂满了猪血，并且把头发沾在斧头的一边。接下来，我抱起那只猪来，贴紧了我胸前的外衣上（这样血就不会滴下来），一直到我找定了屋外一处理想的地方，然后扔进了河里。在这么一个时刻，我又想到了另外一个念头。我便走回去，把那袋玉米和我那把锯子，从独木小舟给取了出来，送回了木屋。把袋子放回平常安放的原处，用锯子在口袋底下钻了一个小洞，因为那里没有刀子或者叉子——爸爸烧菜总是光用他那把折叠刀。接下来，我背着那个袋子，走了一百码的光景，经过那片青草地，穿过屋外东手那个柳树林，到了那浅浅的湖边，有五英里宽，长满了芦苇——你不妨说，一到季节，还会有野鸭哩。在湖面的另一头，有一个水沟或者一处溪沟，可以通出去几英里之外，不知道通往何处，不过并非是注入大河的。王米粉一路漏出来，到浅湖边上，留下了小小的一道印子。我把爸爸的磨刀石也掉在那里，人家一看，会以为是无意间掉下来的。然后我把玉米粉袋的口子给缝了起来，不会再漏了，便把那个袋子和我那把锯子又带回了独木小舟上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I was pretty tired, and the first thing I knowed I was asleep. When I woke up I didn't know where I was for a minute. I set up and looked around, a little scared. Then I remembered. The river looked miles and miles across. The moon was so bright I could a counted the drift logs that went a-slipping along, black and still, hundreds of yards out from shore. Everything was dead quiet, and it looked late, and SMELT late. You know what I mean – I don't know the words to put it in.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我也真累了，不知不觉便睡着了。待到醒回来，一时间不知道身子在何方。我直起身子，四周一张望，可吓了一跳。不久就又回想起来了。河面上仿佛有好多英里宽。月亮通明，那往下漂过的圆木，我几乎能数得清清楚楚。离河岸上百码外，一片漆黑，一片寂静。一切死一般静悄悄。看来不早了，你闻得出来，时间不早了。我是什么个意思，你准知道——我不知道用什么样的词才能表达我的这个意思。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was about dark now; so I dropped the canoe down the river under some willows that hung over the bank, and waited for the moon to rise. I made fast to a willow; then I took a bite to eat, and by and by laid down in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan. I says to myself, they'll follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and then drag the river for me. And they'll follow that meal track to the lake and go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbers that killed me and took the things. They won't ever hunt the river for anything but my dead carcass. They'll soon get tired of that, and won't bother no more about me. All right; I can stop anywhere I want to. Jackson's Island is good enough for me; I know that island pretty well, and nobody ever comes there. And then I can paddle over to town nights, and slink around and pick up things I want. Jackson's Island's the place.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，天擦黑了，所以我把小舟放到了河上，河岸上的几株柳树覆盖着小舟，我就在那儿等着月亮升起。我把独木舟系紧在一株柳树上。我吃了口东西，隔了一会儿，在小舟上躺了下来，吸了口烟，然后计上了心头。我在心里算计，人家会跟踪这袋石块，一直追到岸边，然后往河里寻找我。人家还会跟踪这玉米粉袋，一直追到湖面上，然后沿着从湖水流出的小溪，寻找那些杀死了我、抢劫了财物的强盗。人家往河里找的，无非只是我的尸体。不用多久，人家就会找得厌烦了，不会再为了我烦心。好吧，我哪里都可以去得。杰克逊岛呢，对我来说，可说是个好去处。这座岛我挺熟悉，没有别的人去过。这样，到了夜晚，我就可以划到镇上去，到处偷偷地遛遛，捡些我用得着的东西。杰克逊岛恰好是这样的去处。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I took a good gap and a stretch, and was just going to unhitch and start when I heard a sound away over the water. I listened. Pretty soon I made it out. It was that dull kind of a regular sound that comes from oars working in rowlocks when it's a still night. I peeped out through the willow branches, and there it was – a skiff, away across the water. I couldn't tell how many was in it. It kept a-coming, and when it was abreast of me I see there warn't but one man in it. Think's I, maybe it's pap, though I warn't expecting him. He dropped below me with the current, and by and by he came a-swinging up shore in the easy water, and he went by so close I could a reached out the gun and touched him. Well, it WAS pap, sure enough – and sober, too, by the way he laid his oars.</div>

<div class="line_en">I didn't lose no time. The next minute I was aspinning down stream soft but quick in the shade of the bank. I made two mile and a half, and then struck out a quarter of a mile or more towards the middle of the river, because pretty soon I would be passing the ferry landing, and people might see me and hail me. I got out amongst the driftwood, and then laid down in the bottom of the canoe and let her float. I laid there, and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe, looking away into the sky; not a cloud in it. The sky looks ever so deep when you lay down on your back in the moonshine; I never knowed it before. And how far a body can hear on the water such nights! I heard people talking at the ferry landing. I heard what they said, too – every word of it. One man said it was getting towards the long days and the short nights now. T'other one said THIS warn't one of the short ones, he reckoned – and then they laughed, and he said it over again, and they laughed again; then they waked up another fellow and told him, and laughed, but he didn't laugh; he ripped out something brisk, and said let him alone. The first fellow said he 'lowed to tell it to his old woman – she would think it was pretty good; but he said that warn't nothing to some things he had said in his time. I heard one man say it was nearly three o'clock, and he hoped daylight wouldn't wait more than about a week longer. After that the talk got further and further away, and I couldn't make out the words any more; but I could hear the mumble, and now and then a laugh, too, but it seemed a long ways off.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我毫未迟疑，马上就沿着岸荫底下，悄悄地、快速地朝下游划去。我划了两英里半，然后朝河中央划了四分之一英里多一些，因为我很快便会划到渡口，人家可能会看到我，跟我打招呼。我插到了漂着的木头中间，然后在独木小舟上往下一躺，听任着它漂到哪里就是哪里。我躺在那里，舒舒服服地休息，吸了一口烟，望着远处的天空，只见万里无云。在月光下，躺着望天，才发现天这么幽深，这是我从前所不知道的。象这样的夜晚，河上的声音，老远老远都听得到！渡口那边的说话声，我也听到了。还一个字一个字听得一清二楚。只听见有一个人在说，现今是快到日长夜短的时刻了。另一个人说，依他看，今晚上还不是夜短的时刻——接着他们笑了起来。这人把上面的话又说了一遍，两人又笑了起来。接下来，他叫醒了另一个人，对他也说了一遍，并且笑开了，可是这人并没有笑，只说了句气话，叫人家别惹他。第一个人说，他要把这话告诉他老婆——她准定会认为说得很对。不过，要是和他当年说过的一些话相比，这就算不上什么了。我又听见一个人在说，快三点钟了，但愿等天亮，不必象等一星期那么久。在这以后，谈话声越来越远，再也听不清在说些什么了，不过还能依稀传来些声响，间或有一声笑声，从远处传来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I was away below the ferry now. I rose up, and there was Jackson's Island, about two mile and a half down stream, heavy timbered and standing up out of the middle of the river, big and dark and solid, like a steamboat without any lights. There warn't any signs of the bar at the head – it was all under water now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现今我已经漂过了渡口。我直起身来，杰克逊岛就在眼前啦，就在河下两英里半外，林木深深，耸立在大河中央。又大，又黑森森，又沉稳，活象一只没有点灯的大轮。岛上顶端的沙洲，连一点儿影子也看不见——如今都沉在水里了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I went up and set down on a log at the head of the island, and looked out on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town, three mile away, where there was three or four lights twinkling. A monstrous big lumber-raft was about a mile up stream, coming along down, with a lantern in the middle of it. I watched it come creeping down, and when it was most abreast of where I stood I heard a man say, "Stern oars, there! heave her head to stabboard!" I heard that just as plain as if the man was by my side.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我上了岸，坐在岛顶端一根圆木上，朝外一望，只见前边是大河，还有黑森森漂流着的木头，三英里路外便是镇上了，只见三四点光亮在闪闪烁烁。上游一英里路外，正有一排庞然大物似的木筏子漂过来，木排正中间点着一盏灯。我看着它慢悠悠地过来，快到跟前时听到一个男子在说，“喂，摇尾浆啊！往右边掉头！”听得一清二楚，就仿佛这人是在我身边说的话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It didn't take me long to get there. I shot past the head at a ripping rate, the current was so swift, and then I got into the dead water and landed on the side towards the Illinois shore. I run the canoe into a deep dent in the bank that I knowed about; I had to part the willow branches to get in; and when I made fast nobody could a seen the canoe from the outside.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我没有花多大功夫就划到了那里。水流很急，我的小舟箭一般划过岛的顶端。接下来划到了静水地段，便在面对着伊利诺斯州的一边上了岸。我把小划子划到了我本来熟悉的一个深湾里去。我得拨开柳树丛的枝桠，这才进得去。等我们小划子栓好后，谁也无法从外边看到它的影子。">查看中文翻译</div>
