<div class="line_en">Actually, Denry was making nearly four thousand a year, but he was afraid to tell his mother that. These days he was a great man in the Five Towns, but his greatness was nothing in Brougham Street.</div>

<div class="line_en">One morning a few weeks later, there was a letter for Mrs Machin from the man who owned her house. He had sold the house, he wrote, to a man in London, a Mr Wilbraham. From next month Mrs Machin must pay her rent to him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几周后的一个早晨，梅钦太太收到房东寄来的一封信。他在信里说他已把梅钦夫人住的房子卖给了一个叫威尔布里厄姆的伦敦人。从下个月起，梅钦太太得把房租交给威尔布里厄姆先生。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The house at Bleakridge started to grow. Mr Wilbraham stayed in London. The builder was Mr Cotterill (Denry had been friendly with the family since Llandudno), but Denry also kept an eye on things. The house was nearly finished when Mrs Machin got a second letter from Mr Wilbraham.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布里克里奇的新房子动工了。威尔布里厄姆先生呆在伦敦。建造商是科特里尔先生（从兰迪德诺回来之后，邓瑞和这家人一直保持友好关系），但邓瑞也会关注房子的建设。房子快建好的时候，梅钦太太收到威尔布里厄姆先生的第二封信。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I said yes. Why not? It's easier for you. And he's an interesting man. He's building a new house up at Bleakridge. It's going to be a really modern house; a house where you can live comfortably without servants."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我答应了。为什么不呢？这对你来说更容易。他是个有趣的人。他打算在布里克里奇街盖一座新房子。那将是一座真正现代化的房子；在那样的房子里，没有仆人也能住得很舒服。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“台阶真脏。”梅钦太太看了看地下说道。在布鲁厄姆街，保持台阶干净是非常重要的，即使是房租每周只需 23便士的房子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="他又按了按门铃，但没人应声。“也许他坐的火车晚点了。我有钥匙。我们进去等他。”他开了门，打开了电灯。梅钦太太之前从没见过电灯，她觉得电灯太奇妙了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Finally, they all sat down to supper, and after some food and three bottles of wine they started to enjoy themselves. Soon Denry was searching the house for a fourth bottle of wine. He found one, opened it, drank some, and, with a cry, dropped the glass on the floor, where it broke.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最终，他们全都坐下来吃晚餐，在吃了一些东西，喝了三瓶酒后，他们舒服自在起来。很快，邓瑞开始在房子里找第四瓶酒。他找到一瓶，打开喝了几口，然后叫了一声，杯子掉在地上摔碎了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Three people stood on the washed doorstep -- Mr and Mrs Cotterill, and Nellie. Mr Wilbraham had invited them, said Mr Cotterill.</div>

<div class="line_en">He and Nellie ran upstairs and the others followed. Upstairs the house was as wonderful as downstairs. So easy to clean. No work at all. "Why," said Mrs Cotterill, "I could live here without any servants and still have it clean and tidy by ten o'clock in the morning."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他和内莉跑上楼，其他人跟在后面。楼上和楼下一样妙不可言。房屋如此易于清理，根本没什么要干的。“哎呀！”科特里尔夫人说，“要是我住在这里，不需要仆人，就能在上午十点前把房子收拾干净。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Downstairs they found a fine cold supper ready to eat.</div>
