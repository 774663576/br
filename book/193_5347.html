<div class="line_en">Nights in Rome, like those in the desert, can be surprisingly cool, even after a warm day. Langdon was huddled now on the fringes of Piazza Navona, pulling his jacket around him. Like the distant white noise of traffic, a cacophony of news reports echoed across the city. He checked his watch. Fifteen minutes. He was grateful for a few moments of rest.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="拿佛纳广场。《四河喷泉》。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The piazza was deserted. Bernini's masterful fountain sizzled before him with a fearful sorcery. The foaming pool sent a magical mist upward, lit from beneath by underwater floodlights. Langdon sensed a cool electricity in the air.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="广场上空无一人。他眼前那座出自贝尼尼大师手笔的喷泉发出嘶嘶声，有种诡异的魔力。冒著气泡的水池朝上喷出魔幻的水雾，被水底的泛光灯照亮了。兰登感觉到空中有一股凉凉的电流。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The fountain's most arresting quality was its height. The central core alone was over twenty feet tall -- a rugged mountain of travertine marble riddled with caves and grottoes through which the water churned. The entire mound was draped with pagan figures. Atop this stood an obelisk that climbed another forty feet. Langdon let his eyes climb. On the obelisk's tip, a faint shadow blotted the sky, a lone pigeon perched silently.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这座喷泉最引人注目之处，就是它的高度。光是中轴就超过二十迟高──一座由石灰华大理石所构成的崎岖小山，充满了冒著水的洞穴和石窟。整座石墩上佈满了异教的形象，最顶端则耸立著一座方尖碑，往上还要高出四十迟。兰登目光逐步往上。在方尖碑顶端，有个模糊的暗影衬著天空，是一隻静栖的鸽子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A cross, Langdon thought, still amazed by the arrangement of the markers across Rome. Bernini'sFountain of the Four Rivers was the last altar of science. Only hours ago Langdon had been standing in the Pantheon convinced the Path of Illumination had been broken and he would never get this far. It had been a foolish blunder. In fact, the entire path was intact. Earth, Air, Fire, Water. And Langdon had followed it… from beginning to end.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="十字架，兰登心想，仍为分佈在罗马各处的指标感到惊奇。贝尼尼的《四河喷泉》是最后一个科学祭坛。才几个小时前，兰登站在万神殿裡，还坚信光明路径已经被破坏了，绝对想不到自己能追到这裡。那真是个愚蠢的大错。事实上，整条路径完整无缺。土、气、火、水。兰登一路遵循……从起点来到了终点。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Not quite to the end, he reminded himself. The path hadfive stops, not four. This fourth marker fountain somehow pointed to the ultimate destiny -- the Illuminati's sacred lair -- the Church of Illumination. Langdon wondered if the lair were still standing. He wondered if that was where the Hassassin had taken Vittoria.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="还不算到终点，他提醒自己。这条路径有五站，不是四站。此处第四个指标所在的喷泉，是以某种方式指向最终目标──光明会神圣的祕密基地──光明教堂。兰登很纳闷那个祕密基地是否依然存在，很想知道哈撒辛是不是就把薇多利雅带到那裡去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Langdon found his eyes probing the figures in the fountain, looking for any clue as to the direction of the lair. Let angels guide you on your lofty quest. Almost immediately, though, he was overcome by an unsettling awareness. This fountain contained no angels whatsoever. It certainly contained none Langdon could see from where he was standing… and none he had ever seen in the past. The Fountain of the Four Rivers was a pagan work. The carvings were all profane -- humans, animals, even an awkward armadillo. An angel here would stick out like a sore thumb.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登的双眼不自觉地搜索著喷泉上的那些雕像，想找寻任何指向光明会祕密基地的线索。崇高追寻路，天使引向前。但几乎是立刻，他心中充满了一种不安之感，因为他发现这个喷泉裡没有任何天使。从兰登的位置，很确定什麽天使都没有……以前他也没见到过。《四河喷泉》是一件异教作品，裡面全是世俗的雕像──人类、动物，甚至还有一隻笨拙的犰狳。一个天使若放在这裡，一定会非常刺眼。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After making two complete circuits, the van banked inward toward Bernini's fountain. It pulled abreast of the basin, moving laterally along the rim until its side was flush with the fountain. Then it parked, its sliding door positioned only inches above the churning water.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="厢型车绕了整整两圈后，往内朝贝尼尼的喷泉弯去，与水池边缘平行，然后沿著池边左右移动，直到车侧紧贴著喷泉。然后车子停下来，侧边拉门距离下方翻腾的水面只有几吋。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Is this the wrong place? He considered the cruciform arrangement of the four obelisks. He clenched his fists. This fountain is perfect.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个地方不对吗？他想著四座方尖碑所佈置成的十字架形状，然后握紧了拳头。这个喷泉绝对没错。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was only 10:46P. M. when a black van emerged from the alleyway on the far side of the piazza. Langdon would not have given it a second look except that the van drove with no headlights. Like a shark patrolling a moonlit bay, the vehicle circled the perimeter of the piazza.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="才十点四十六分，有辆黑色厢型车从广场另一端的巷子裡冒出来。要不是那辆车没开车前大灯，兰登根本不会多看它一眼。那辆车绕著广场周围兜圈子，就像鲨鱼在月光照耀的海湾巡行觅食。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mist billowed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="水雾滚滚翻腾著。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Langdon felt an uneasy premonition. Had the Hassassin arrived early? Had he come in a van? Langdon had imagined the killer escorting his last victim across the piazza on foot, like he had at St. Peter's, giving Langdon an open shot. But if the Hassassin had arrived in a van, the rules had just changed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登有种不安的预感。那个哈撒辛提早到了吗？他是开著厢型车来吗？兰登的印象仍停留在圣彼得广场上，当时那个杀手是徒步带著被害人走进广场的，这样兰登就有绝佳的攻击机会。但如果那个哈撒辛是开著厢型车来，规则就全盘改变了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Langdon hunkered lower, crouched in the shadows beside the huge stairway leading up to the Church of St. Agnes in Agony. He gazed out at the piazza, his pulse climbing.</div>

<div class="line_en">On the floor of the van, contorted in agony, lay a naked man. The man was wrapped in yards of heavy chains. He thrashed against the iron links, but the chains were too heavy. One of the links bisected the man's mouth like a horse's bit, stifling his cries for help. It was then that Langdon saw the second figure, moving around behind the prisoner in the dark, as though making final preparations.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="车裡的地板上，躺著一名赤裸男子，正痛苦地扭曲著。那男子身上缠著数码长的沉重铁鍊，他拼命在铁鍊中挣扎，可是鍊子太重了。其中一个鍊环像马衔鍊般撑开那人的嘴，使得他无法喊叫求助。此时兰登才看到第二个人影，在那个俘虏后方移动，好像在做最后的准备。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Taking the gun, he slipped off his jacket and dropped it on the ground. He didn't want the added encumbrance of a tweed jacket, nor did he have any intention of taking Galileo'sDiagramma anywhere near the water. The document would stay here where it was safe and dry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他拿著枪，脱掉外套扔在地上。他不希望这件粗呢外套徒增累赘，也不打算带著伽利略的《图解》靠近水边。那张文献留在这裡会比较安全且乾燥。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Langdon scrambled to his right. Circling the perimeter of the fountain, he positioned himself directly opposite the van. The fountain's massive centerpiece obscured his view. Standing, he ran directly toward the basin. He hoped the thundering water was drowning his footsteps. When he reached the fountain, he climbed over the rim and dropped into the foaming pool.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登爬向右边，绕著广场边缘，来到那辆厢型车的正对面之处。喷泉中央巨大的雕像群刚好挡在那裡替他遮掩。他站在那儿，然后直直朝水池衝去，期望轰然的水声掩盖他的脚步声。来到喷泉旁，他翻过水池边缘，进入不断冒著气泡的池中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Waist-deep in water, Robert Langdon raised his gun and stepped out of the mist, feeling like some sort of aquatic cowboy making a final stand. "Don't move." His voice was steadier than the gun.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在及腰的水中，罗柏．兰登举起枪，走出水雾，觉得自己好像什麽水中牛仔，正在奋力做最后一搏。「不准动。」他的声音很稳，枪却没那麽稳。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Hassassin looked up. For a moment he seemed confused, as though he had seen a ghost. Then his lips curled into an evil smile. He raised his arms in submission. "And so it goes."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈撒辛抬头。一时之间似乎很困惑，好像刚刚见到了鬼。然后他的双唇一弯，露出邪恶的微笑。他双手抬起，摆出投降的姿势。「就照你的吩咐吧。」">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He reached the interior of the fountain and circled back to his left. He waded hard, clinging to the cover of the marble forms. Hiding himself behind the huge carved form of a horse, Langdon peered out. The van was only fifteen feet away. The Hassassin was crouched on the floor of the van, hands planted on the cardinal's chain-clad body, preparing to roll him out the open door into the fountain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到了喷泉内侧，兰登又回头往左边绕。他吃力地涉水，紧紧抓著大理石雕像的表面。然后兰登躲在一隻巨大雕马的后方，偷偷望出去。那辆厢型车就在十五迟外。哈撒辛正蹲在车厢内地板上，双手牢牢抓住枢机主教被铁鍊捆著的身体，准备要推著滚出那扇打开的门，好让他掉进喷泉中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The water was waist deep and like ice. Langdon grit his teeth and plowed through the water. The bottom was slippery, made doubly treacherous by a stratum of coins thrown for good luck. Langdon sensed he would need more than good luck. As the mist rose all around him, he wondered if it was the cold or the fear that was causing the gun in his hand to shake.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="池中水深及腰，冷得像冰。兰登咬紧牙，涉水前行。池底滑溜溜的，又积了一层许愿祈福的硬币，使得脚下更不牢靠。兰登觉得自己不能只靠运气了。扬起的水雾笼罩著他，他已经分不清让他手上的枪颤抖的原因，是寒冷还是恐惧。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Langdon stepped closer, his footing tentative beneath the water. The Hassassin looked remarkably calm, squatting there in the back of the van with his arms raised over his head.

<div class="line_cn" title="兰登走得更近，脚在水底下探著。哈撒辛看来异常冷静，蹲在厢型车后头，双手高举过头。兰登瞄准他的胸部，不知道自己是不是应该乾脆先开枪，接著再来想办法算了。不。他知道薇多利雅在哪裡。他知道反物质在哪裡。我得问出来才行！">查看中文翻译</div>

Then, violently, his body rolled, causing Langdon to lose his grip on the slippery chains. Like a stone, Baggia went down again and disappeared beneath the foaming water.</div>
