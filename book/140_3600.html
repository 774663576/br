<div class="line_en">By the united aid of medals, manuscripts, and inscriptions, I am enabled to say, positively, that the borough of Vondervotteimittiss has existed, from its origin, in precisely the same condition which it at present preserves. Of the date of this origin, however, I grieve that I can only speak with that species of indefinite definiteness which mathematicians are, at times, forced to put up with in certain algebraic formulae. The date, I may thus say, in regard to the remoteness of its antiquity, cannot be less than any assignable quantity whatsoever.</div>

<div class="line_en">Every body knows, in a general way, that the finest place in the world is -- or, alas, was -- the Dutch borough of Vondervotteimittiss. Yet, as it lies some distance from any of the main roads, being in a somewhat out-of-the-way situation, there are, perhaps, very few of my readers who have ever paid it a visit. For the benefit of those who have not, therefore, it will be only proper that I should enter into some account of it. And this is, indeed, the more necessary, as with the hope of enlisting public sympathy in behalf of the inhabitants, I design here to give a history of the calamitous events which have so lately occurred within its limits. No one who knows me will doubt that the duty thus self-imposed will be executed to the best of my ability, with all that rigid impartiality, all that cautious examination into facts, and diligent collation of authorities, which should ever distinguish him who aspires to the title of historian.</div>

<div class="line_en">Touching the derivation of the name Vondervotteimittiss, I confess myself, with sorrow, equally at fault. -- Among a multitude of opinions upon this delicate point, some acute, some learned, some sufficiently the reverse -- I am able to select nothing which ought to be considered satisfactory. Perhaps the idea of Grogswigg -- nearly coincident with that of Kroutaplenttey -- is to be cautiously preferred. -- It runs: — "Vondervotteimittis -- Vonder, lege Donder -- Votteimittis, quasi und Bleitziz -- Bleitziz obsol: pro Blitzen." This derivative, to say the truth, is still countenanced by some traces of the electric fluid evident on the summit of the steeple of the House of the Town-Council. I do not choose, however, to commit myself on a theme of such importance, and must refer the reader desirous of information, to the "Oratiunculæ de Rebus Præter-Veteris," of Dundergutz. See, also, Blunderbuzzard "De Derivationibus," pp. 27 to 5010, Folio, Gothic edit., Red and Black character, Catch-word and No Cypher; wherein consult, also, marginal notes in the autograph of Stuffundpuff, with the Sub-Commentaries of Gruntundguzzell.</div>

<div class="line_en">Notwithstanding the obscurity which thus envelops the date of the foundation of Vondervotteimittis, and the derivation of its name, there can be no doubt, as I said before, that it has always existed as we find it at this epoch. The oldest man in the borough can remember not the slightest difference in the appearance of any portion of it; and, indeed, the very suggestion of such a possibility is considered an insult. The site of the village is in a perfectly circular valley, about a quarter of a mile in circumference, and entirely surrounded by gentle hills, over whose summit the people have never yet ventured to pass. For this they assign the very good reason that they do not believe there is anything at all on the other side.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管沃顿沃提米提斯建立的时间以及其名字的出处无从得知，可有一点是毫无疑问的，就是我前面提到的，这镇子一直以我们眼中的那个样子延续至今。镇上年纪最大的老人也记不起它外貌上的点滴变化；并且，事实上任何诸如此类的建议都会被认为是一种冒犯。村子座落于一个正圆形的山谷中，周长大约是四分之一英里，四周环绕着小山，而镇中的人们从来没有冒险去翻越这些山头。对于这个，镇民们给出了个极好的理由，他们压根儿不相信山那边有什么东西。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Round the skirts of the valley, (which is quite level, and paved throughout with flat tiles,) extends a continuous row of sixty little houses. These, having their backs on the hills, must look, of course, to the centre of the plain, which is just sixty yards from the front door of each dwelling. Every house has a small garden before it, with a circular path, a sun-dial, and twenty-four cabbages. The buildings themselves are so precisely alike, that one can in no manner be distinguished from the other. Owing to the vast antiquity, the style of architecture is somewhat odd, but it is not for that reason the less strikingly picturesque. They are fashioned of hard-burned little bricks, red, with black ends, so that the walls look like a chess-board upon a great scale. The gables are turned to the front, and there are cornices, as big as all the rest of the house, over the eaves and over the main doors. The windows are narrow and deep, with very tiny panes and a great deal of sash. On the roof is a vast quantity of tiles with long curly ears. The woodwork, throughout, is of a dark hue, and there is much carving about it, with but a trifling variety of pattern; for, time out of mind, the carvers of Vondervotteimittiss have never been able to carve more than two objects -- a time-piece and a cabbage. But these they do exceedingly well, and intersperse them, with singular ingenuity, wherever they find room for the chisel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="环绕着山谷的边缘（那儿很平坦，铺满了扁扁的瓦片），一溜儿立着六十栋小屋子。它们背倚山岗，面向平原，每栋小屋的前门距平原中央仅有六十码远。屋前的小花园中有一条环形小径，一个计时器和二十四棵卷心菜。这些房子极其相似，以至于没法把一栋和另一栋区别开来。因为年代久远，房屋的式样有些古怪，可要不是这个原因，它们也不会具如此引人注目，不会如此独特。因了那些用烈火烧成的、两端黑中间红的小砖头，屋子的外墙看上去像是放大了比例的棋盘，显得很时尚。两端的山形墙朝向正面，屋檐和正门的上方的檐口和房子的其余部分一样大小。又窄又深的窗户上装有很多窗格，镶着整洁的玻璃。屋顶上铺着数不清的长耳瓦片。这儿所有的木工活都是一种暗色调，它们经过精雕细刻，不过式样单一，很久以前，沃顿沃提米提斯的雕刻师们就只能雕两样东西——计时器和卷心菜。不过他们雕起这两样时干的可真出色，落凿处构思精巧，富有独创性。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The fire-places are large and deep, with fierce crooked-looking fire-dogs. There is constantly a rousing fire, and a huge pot over it, full of sauer-kraut and pork, to which the good woman of the house is always busy in attending. She is a little fat old lady, with blue eyes and a red face, and wears a huge cap like a sugar-loaf, ornamented with purple and yellow ribbons. Her dress is of orange-colored linsey-woolsey, made very full behind and very short in the waist -- and indeed very short in other respects, not reaching below the middle of her leg. This is somewhat thick, and so are her ankles, but she has a fine pair of green stockings to cover them. Her shoes -- of pink leather -- are fastened each with a bunch of yellow ribbons puckered up in the shape of a cabbage. In her left hand she has a little heavy Dutch watch; in her right she wields a ladle for the sauer-kraut and pork. By her side there stands a fat tabby cat, with a gilt toy repeater tied to its tail, which "the boys" have there fastened by way of a quiz.</div>

<div class="line_en">The dwellings are as much alike inside as out, and the furniture is all upon one plan. The floors are of square tiles, the chairs and tables of black-looking wood with thin crooked legs and puppy feet. The mantel-pieces are wide and high, and have not only time-pieces and cabbages sculptured over the front, but a real time-piece, which makes a prodigious ticking, on the top in the middle, with a flower-pot containing a cabbage standing on each extremity by way of outrider. Between each cabbage and the time-piece, again, is a little China man having a large stomach with a great round hole in it, through which is seen the dial-plate of a watch.</div>

<div class="line_en">Right at the front door, in a high-backed leather-bottomed armed chair, with crooked legs and puppy feet like the tables, is seated the old man of the house himself. He is an exceedingly puffy little old gentleman, with big circular eyes and a huge double chin. His dress resembles that of the boys -- and I need say nothing farther about it. All the difference is, that his pipe is somewhat bigger than theirs, and he can make a greater smoke. Like them, he has a watch, but he carries his watch in his pocket. To say the truth, he has something of more importance than a watch to attend to -- and what that is, I shall presently explain. He sits with his right leg upon his left knee, wears a grave countenance, and always keeps one of his eyes, at least, resolutely bent upon a certain remarkable object in the centre of the plain.</div>

<div class="line_en">The boys themselves are, all three of them, in the garden attending the pig. They are each two feet in height. They have three-cornered cocked hats, purple waistcoats reaching down to their thighs, buckskin knee-breeches, red woollen stockings, heavy shoes with big silver buckles, and long surtout coats with large buttons of mother-of-pearl. Each, too, has a pipe in his mouth, and a little dumpy watch in his right hand. He takes a puff and a look, and then a look and a puff. The pig -- which is corpulent and lazy -- is occupied now in picking up the stray leaves that fall from the cabbages, and now in giving a kick behind at the gilt repeater, which the urchins have also tied to his tail, in order to make him look as handsome as the cat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="三个男孩子们则都在花园里喂猪。他们的个头有两英尺高。带着三角尖帽，身上的紫色背心直拖到了大腿，穿着长到膝盖的鹿皮短裤，红色长袜，和饰有银制大带扣的重靴子，套了一件钉着珍珠母大纽扣的男式大衣。每人嘴里都衔着一支烟斗，右手握了块小小的表。他们喷口烟，看看表，再喷口烟，再看看表。那只肥胖慵懒的猪此刻正忙着一会儿啃着掉下来的卷心菜叶子，一会儿往后踢一下镀金打簧表，顽皮的孩子们把这个东西系在了它的尾巴上，好让它看起来像那只猫一样漂亮。">查看中文翻译</div>

The Town-Council are all very little, round, oily, intelligent men, with big saucer eyes and fat double chins, and have their coats much longer and their shoe-buckles much bigger than the ordinary inhabitants of Vondervotteimittiss. Since my sojourn in the borough, they have had several special meetings, and have adopted these three important resolutions: — "That it is wrong to alter the good old course of things."</div>

<div class="line_en">The great clock has seven faces -- one in each of the seven sides of the steeples (steeple) -- so that it can be readily seen from all quarters. Its faces are large and white, and its hands heavy and black. There is a belfry-man whose sole duty is to attend to it; but this duty is the most perfect of sinecures -- for the clock of Vondervotteimittis was never yet known to have anything the matter with it. Until lately, the bare supposition of such a thing was considered heretical. From the remotest period of antiquity to which the archives have reference, the hours have been regularly struck by the big bell. And, indeed, the case was just the same with all the other clocks and watches in the borough. Never was such a place for keeping the true time. When the large clapper thought proper to say "Twelve o'clock!" all its obedient followers opened their throats simultaneously, and responded like a very echo. In short, the good burghers were fond of their sauer-kraut, but then they were proud of their clocks.</div>

He descended the hills at a great rate, so that everybody had soon a good look at him. He was really the most finnicky (finicky) little personage that had ever been seen in Vondervotteimittiss. His countenance was of a dark snuff-color, and he had a long hooked nose, pea eyes, a wide mouth, and an excellent set of teeth, which latter he seemed anxious of displaying, as he was grinning from ear to ear. What with mustachios and whiskers, there was none of the rest of his face to be seen. His head was uncovered, and his hair neatly done up in papillotes. His dress was a tight-fitting swallow-tailed black coat, (from one of whose pockets dangled a vast length of white handkerchief,) black kerseymere knee-breeches, black stockings, and stumpy-looking pumps, with huge bunches of black satin ribbon for bows. Under one arm he carried a huge chapeau-de-bras, and under the other a fiddle nearly five times as big as himself. In his left hand was a gold snuff-box, from which, as he capered down the hill, cutting all manner of fantastical steps, he took snuff incessantly with an air of the greatest possible self-satisfaction. God bless me! -- here was a sight for the honest burghers of Vondervotteimittiss!</div>

<div class="line_en">The good people of the borough had scarcely a chance, however, to get their eyes thoroughly open, when, just as it wanted half a minute of noon, the rascal bounced, as I say, right into the midst of them; gave a chassez here, and a balancez there; and then, after a pirouette and a pas-de-zephyr, pigeon-winged himself right up into the belfry of the House of the Town-Council, where the wonder-stricken belfry-man sat smoking in a state of dignity and dismay. But the little chap seized him at once by the nose; gave it a swing and a pull; clapped the big chapeau-de-bras upon his head; knocked it down over his eyes and mouth; and then, lifting up the big fiddle, beat him with it so long and so soundly, that what with the belfry-man being so fat, and the fiddle being so hollow, you would have sworn that there was a regiment of double-bass drummers all beating the devil's tattoo up in the belfry of the steeple of Vondervotteimittiss.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是，那恶棍蹦来跳去的直闯到他们中间的时候，善良的镇民们却几乎没机会完全张开眼睛，这时只差半分钟就到正午了。他这儿跳一个滑步，那儿来一个金鸡独立，然后，在一个旋转和一下和风舞步之后，鸽子般飞上了镇参议会大楼的塔楼。目瞪口呆的塔楼看守人正坐在那儿庄重又惊愕地抽着烟。这小家伙一下揪住他的鼻子又是晃又是拽；还“啪啪”地扇他头上的大三角帽，把它往下敲盖住了看守人的眼睛和嘴巴；接着，举起那柄巨大的小提琴，打了他很久，打得很厉害。由于那看守人是那么胖，再加上小提琴很空，你会发誓，那是沃顿沃提米提斯尖塔的塔楼里一群双倍低音鼓的鼓手一起痛击魔鬼的鼓点。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">To speak plainly, the fellow had, in spite of his grinning, an audacious and sinister kind of face; and as he curvetted right into the village, the odd stumpy appearance of his pumps excited no little suspicion; and many a burgher who beheld him that day, would have given a trifle for a peep beneath the white cambric handkerchief which hung so obtrusively from the pocket of his swallow-tailed coat. But what mainly occasioned a righteous indignation was, that the scoundrelly popinjay, while he cut a fandango here, and a whirligig there, did not seem to have the remotest idea in the world of such a thing as keeping time in his steps.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="坦白说，尽管这家伙咧着嘴在笑，可还是长了一张卤莽、阴险而邪恶的脸；当他直冲冲地蹦进村庄的时候，他的古老的、粗粗短短的鞋子并没有引起人们的疑心。那天好多看到他的人，本来不屑于瞥一眼他身上细薄布的白手帕以下的部分——那手帕从他的燕尾服外套的口袋里耷拉下来。可是激起大家义愤的是，这个恶棍般的花花公子这儿跳一步西班牙舞，那儿跳一步旋转舞步，根本没有一丝一毫念头要让他的步子踩准节拍。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There is no knowing to what desperate act of vengeance this unprincipled attack might have aroused the inhabitants, but for the important fact that it now wanted only half a second of noon. The bell was about to strike, and it was a matter of absolute and pre-eminent necessity that every body should look well at his watch. It was evident, however, that just at this moment, the fellow in the steeple was doing something that he had no business to do with the clock. But as it now began to strike, nobody had any time to attend to his manœuvres, for they had all to count the strokes of the bell as it sounded.</div>

<div class="line_en">Meantime the cabbages all turned very red in the face, and it seemed as if old Nick himself had taken possession of everything in the shape of a time-piece. The clocks carved upon the furniture took to dancing as if bewitched, while those upon the mantel-pieces could scarcely contain themselves for fury, and kept such a continual striking of thirteen, and such a frisking and wriggling of their pendulums as was really horrible to see. -- But, worse than all, neither the cats nor the pigs could put up any longer with the behavior of the little repeaters tied to their tails, and resented it by scampering all over the place, scratching and poking, and squeaking and screeching, and caterwauling and squalling, and flying into the faces, and running under the petticoats of the people, and creating altogether the most abominable din and confusion which it is possible for a reasonable person to conceive. And to make matters still more distressing, the rascally little scape-grace in the steeple was evidently exerting himself to the utmost. Every now and then one might catch a glimpse of the scoundrel through the smoke. There he sat in the belfry upon the belfry-man, who was lying flat upon his back. In his teeth the villain held the bell-rope, which he kept jerking about with his head, raising such a clatter that my ears ring again even to think of it. On his lap lay the big fiddle at which he was scraping out of all time and tune, with both hands, making a great show, the nincompoop! of playing "Judy O'Flannagan and Paddy O'Raferty."</div>
