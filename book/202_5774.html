<div class="line_en">Sixteen years of being addressed thus left Harry in no doubt whom his uncle was calling; nevertheless, he did not immediately respond. He was still gazing at the mirror fragment in which, for a split second, he had thought he saw Dumbledore's eye. It was not until his uncle bellowed, "BOY!" that Harry got slowly to his feet and headed for the bedroom door, pausing to add the piece of broken mirror to the rucksack filled with things he would be taking with him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry strolled downstairs, his hands deep in his jeans pockets. When he reached the living room he found all three Dursleys. They were dressed for traveling: Uncle Vernon in a fawn zip-up jacket, Aunt Petunia in a neat salmon-colored coat, and Dudley, Harry's large, blond, muscular cousin, in his leather jacket.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利双手插在牛仔裤的口袋里，慢慢地走下楼梯。他来到客厅，发现德思礼一家三口都在。他们一副出远门的打扮：弗农姨父穿着一件浅黄褐色的拉链夹克，佩妮姨妈穿着一件式样简洁的浅橙色上衣，哈利那位大块头、黄头发、肌肉发达的表哥达力，穿着皮夹克。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry sat. He thought he knew what was coming. His uncle began to pace up and down, Aunt Petunia and Dudley following his movements with anxious expressions. Finally, his large purple face crumpled with concentration, Uncle Vernon stopped in front of Harry and spoke.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利坐下了。他似乎猜到了是什么事。姨父开始在房间里踱来踱去，佩妮姨妈和达力用目光追随着姨父，一副忧心忡忡的样子。最后，弗农姨父在哈利面前停下脚步，绛紫色的大脸膛皱成一团，开口说话了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It's all a lot of claptrap," said Uncle Vernon, glaring at Harry with piggy little eyes. "I've decided I don't believe a word of it. We're staying put, we're not going anywhere."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“都是些骗人的鬼话，”弗农姨父用一双小猪眼睛盯着哈利，“我决定一个字也不相信。我们不走，哪儿也不去。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“不许用那种口气——”佩妮姨妈尖声嚷了起来，弗农姨父挥挥手叫她闭嘴。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry looked up at his uncle and felt a mixture of exasperation and amusement. Vernon Dursley had been changing his mind every twenty-four hours for the past four weeks, packing and unpacking and repacking the car with every change of heart. Harry's favorite moment had been the one when Uncle Vernon, unaware that Dudley had added his dumbbells to his case since the last time it had been unpacked, had attempted to hoist it back into the boot and collapsed with roars of pain and much swearing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利抬头看着姨父，觉得又气恼又好笑。在过去的四个星期里，弗农·德思礼每二十四小时就要改变一次主意，每次改变主意都要折腾一番，把行李搬上车，搬下车、再搬上车。哈利觉得最可爱的是弗农姨父想把行李重新拎进汽车后备箱，却不知道达力这次把哑铃装进了行李，结果被坠得摔倒在地，又气又疼，破口大骂。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“哼，我不相信，”弗农姨父又说了一遍，再次在哈利面前停住脚步，“我昨天半夜没睡，盘算着这个事情，肯定是阴谋，想霸占房子。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Vernon Dursley hunched his shoulders angrily, and Harry guessed that his uncle was attempting to ward off recollections of the unannounced visit, a few days into Harry's summer holidays, of two fully grown wizards. The arrival on the doorstep of Kingsley Shacklebolt and Arthur Weasley had come as a most unpleasant shock to the Dursleys.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弗农·德思礼气呼呼地弓起肩膀，哈利猜想姨父是想摆脱那段回忆。当时哈利刚放暑假没几天，两个成年巫师突然来访。金斯莱·沙克尔和亚瑟·韦斯莱出现在门口，给德思礼一家带来了极不愉快的惊吓。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry had to admit, however, that as Mr. Weasley had once demolished half of the living room, his reappearance could not have been expected to delight Uncle Vernon.</div>

<div class="line_en">"-- Kingsley and Mr. Weasley explained it all as well," Harry pressed on remorselessly. "Once I'm seventeen, the protective charm that keeps me safe will break, and that exposes you as well as me. The Order is sure Voldemort will target you, whether to torture you to try and find out where I am, or because he thinks by holding you hostage I'd come and try to rescue you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“——金斯莱和韦斯莱先生也解释过了，”哈利不为所动地继续说道，“我一满十七岁，保护我安全的符咒就会解除，我和你们就会暴露。凤凰社相信伏地魔会把目标锁定你们，或者折磨你们，拷问我的下落，或者以为把你们扣为人质我就会赶去援救。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Uncle Vernon's and Harry's eyes met. Harry was sure that in that instant they were both wondering the same thing. Then Uncle Vernon walked on and Harry resumed, "You've got to go into hiding and the Order wants to help. You're being offered serious protection, the best there is."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="弗农姨父和哈利的目光相遇了。这一刻，哈利相信两人心里产生了同样的疑问。然后，弗农姨父又开始踱步，哈利接着说道：“你们必须躲起来，凤凰社愿意帮忙，给你们提供最好的、最严密的保护。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Uncle Vernon said nothing, but continued to pace up and down. Outside the sun hung low over the privet hedges. The next-door neighbor's lawn mower stalled again.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“不是有个魔法部吗？”弗农·德思礼突然问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry laughed; he could not help himself. It was so very typical of his uncle to put his hopes in the establishment, even within this world that he despised and mistrusted.</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry managed not to roll his eyes, but with difficulty. This question had also been addressed half a dozen times.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利使劲忍了忍，才没有转动眼珠子。这个问题也已经提过六七遍了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"As I've told you," he said through gritted teeth, "Kingsley is protecting the Mug -- I mean, your Prime Minister."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Exactly -- he's the best!" said Uncle Vernon, pointing at the blank television screen. The Dursleys had spotted Kingsley on the news, walking along discreetly behind the Muggle Prime Minister as he visited a hospital. This, and the fact that Kingsley had mastered the knack of dressing like a Muggle, not to mention a certain reassuring something in his slow, deep voice, had caused the Dursleys to take to Kingsley in a way that they had certainly not done with any other wizard, although it was true that they had never seen him with his earring in.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“这就对了——他是最棒的！”弗农姨父指着空白的电视屏幕说。德思礼一家在新闻里见过金斯莱，他在麻瓜首相访问医院时悄悄地跟在后面。凭这一点，还有金斯莱掌握了麻瓜的穿衣窍门，更重要的是他那低沉、缓慢的声音里有某种令人宽慰的东西，使德思礼一家在巫师中独独对金斯莱另眼相看，不过呢，他们从来没见过金斯莱戴耳环的样子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Very clever of you, sir, very clever, I personally would be utterly bamboozled by all those buttons and knobs," said Dedalus.

<div class="line_cn" title="“您真聪明，先生，真聪明，我一看到那么多按键和旋钮就彻底糊涂了。”德达洛说。他显然以为自己是在恭维弗农·德思礼，而德思礼对计划的信心，显然在随着德达洛说的每一句话而逐渐丧失。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I see you are packed and ready. Excellent! The plan, as Harry has told you, is a simple one," said Dedalus, pulling an immense pocket watch out of his waistcoat and examining it. "We shall be leaving before Harry does. Due to the danger of using magic in your house -- Harry being still underage, it could provide the Ministry with an excuse to arrest him -- we shall be driving, say, ten miles or so, before Disapparating to the safe location we have picked out for you. You know how to drive, I take it?" he asked Uncle Vernon politely.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你们收拾了东西，做好了准备。太好了！计划很简单，就像哈利告诉你们的一样，”德达洛说着，从马甲里掏出一块巨大的怀表看了看，“我们先走，哈利后走。由于在你们家里使用魔法有危险——哈利还没成年，这会使魔法部有借口逮捕他——我们先把车开出去，这么说吧，开出十英里左右，然后再幻影移形，到我们为你们选择的安全地方去。我想，您会开会吧？”他很有礼貌地问弗农姨父。">查看中文翻译</div>
