<div class="line_en">Communication as a concept is much used in anthropology. From one perspective, whole cultures may be viewed as systems that govern the communication of women, goods, rights and obligations and messages. A classic work deals with the importance of gift-giving as a means of tying individuals and groups together to form the basis of society. It would seem therefore that the hopeful anthropologist would find such matters a fruitful topic for research and a useful means of creating his own bonds with the people he is studying.</div>

<div class="line_en">One of the customs that attracts the jackdaw gaze of the ethnographer is the surrogate language used by Dowayos at circumcision. The 'talking drums' of West Africa feature commonly in ethnography and lurid adventure stories. In principle, they are generally much like the surrogate language of the Dowayo boys isolated, after the cutting, in the bush. Whereas the drums vary in tone to imitate the tone patterns of speech, Dowayos use small flutes to copy the patterns of language. Such flutes must be used to communicate with women to whom the boys are very dangerous. Similar flutes 'sing' songs at particular festivals. Such a usage could easily be adapted for more practical purposes. In the mountainous terrain of the Canary Islands, a whistled language enables men to communicate over a distance of miles that would take many hours to cross on foot. In the Dowayo mountains, however, the only people who ever found it useful were Matthieu and I when in pursuit of the elusive rain-chief. We could each visit a different peak where he was simultaneously supposed to be and report to each other across the void whether we had found him or not.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="另一个吸引民族志学者鹰目眈视的习俗是多瓦悠人在割礼时使用的替代性语言。有关西非洲的民俗志文献或者多彩多姿的冒险故事常提到“说话鼓”，在使用原则上，它们很像多瓦悠男孩割礼后、待在丛林里隔离时所使用的替代性语言。说话鼓是以音高变化来模仿语言的音调模式，多瓦悠人则釆用小笛子“说话”。刚行过割礼的男孩对女人十分危险，只能借笛子与女人沟通。同样的笛子也用在某些特定仪式，用来“唱”出歌（2）。替代性语言有其他更实际的用途。譬如加纳利群岛（Canary Islands）的山区，相隔数里的人可用哨叫语言（whistled language）来沟通，否则便得步行数小时才能碰头。但是在多瓦悠山区，只有我与马修如此使用说话笛。每次出去寻找喜欢避不见面的祈雨酋长，不同的人会告诉我们酋长位于不同山头我与马修分头寻找，隔着远距离，用说话笛通知对方找到没。【注：（2）说话鼓或其他可调整音高的乐器，借由调整音高来模仿音调语言（tonal language）的高低音，用以传达字义。所谓的音调语言是指有声调变化的语言，臀如普通话有四声。同样的音，醫如一声是“窝”，三声为“我”，四声又成“握”，字义也跟着产生变化。英语非音调语言，这些声调高低的变化对作者而言很难分辨。文中所说用笛子“唱歌”是指曲调吹出，听者光凭音的高低，便可分辨字义，进而听出歌词。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The young man who did the washing at the mission proved to be adept at the skill and we withdrew from the prying eyes of women into the bush so that he could point out the refinements of the tongue. Here, I was given my small flute and instruction began. It was the only experience of formal teaching that I ever had in Dowayoland. Dowayos, until the introduction of French teaching in schools, learned their languages while still small in social encounters. The notion of deliberately setting out to learn a tongue, of studying a verb in all its parts, would be unknown. Boys, however, had to be taught the uses of the flute in a fairly concentrated bout of step-by-step instruction. Orderly presentation of material and homespun teaching techniques were called into play. This was all in complete contrast to the spoken language where systematic help could not be had.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我发现教会的洗衣工非常熟稔说话笛技巧，我们躲开女人的窥视，躲到丛林里，他将教导我此种替代性语言的精细之处。他给了我一把小笛，开始我们的课程。这是我在多瓦悠兰唯一的正式教育。在法国殖民势力引进学校教育前，多瓦悠孩子都是在自然的社会接触里学习母语。刻意学习一种语言或者研究一个动词的各种用法，是从未听闻之事。相较于母语的学习，多瓦悠小男孩必须透过密集的一步步指导学习说话笛，在这过程里，多瓦悠人会大量展示循序渐进的教学器材与自家研发的教学技巧，与学习多瓦悠语系统化辅助一概阙如，实有天壤之别。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For the language learner it had many advantages, helping clearly to pick out the different tones in a tongue that -- to the Western ear -- made distinctions almost impossible to hear. Since the boys would be using the surrogate language extensively as a sort of insulating device against excessively direct contact, it was wise to seek further instruction in it as they would themselves.</div>

<div class="line_en">Receiving gifts can similarly lead to difficulties. Not running a large establishment, I had always managed to do all necessary cooking in two saucepans. These similarly served as coffee-pot or teapot. It would anyway have laid one open to charges of deliberate eccentricity to possess a teapot in such a remote spot. This situation was perfectly satisfactory to all save Matthieu. Somewhere, probably at the mission, he had seen tea served as it would be by a butler, with tray, sugar-bowl and teapot. Since his own status -- of which he was very much aware -- was dependent on my own he bitterly objected to tea being served to visiting dignitaries poured from the side of an aluminium saucepan. He pined for a teapot.</div>

A heavy shower was unleashing itself in short but intense unpleasantness. We all sheltered together under the inadequate foliage. His finery looked decidedly weathered. The horse tails, once erect and feathery, were soggy and matted. The long gowns were streaked with mud, beer, oil and perspiration. My leopard-pattern Fablon had stood up well as far as the front surface was concerned, but the sticky coating of the rear had fared less well. A thick mat compounded of hair, mosquitoes and the red soil of West Africa adhered glue-like to its surface. The bright headscarf had sagged sluttishly down over one eye. He pouted perceptibly. It was clear that this period, vaunted as a time of licence and indulgence, bright in the minds of old men, had become tedious to him. His kinsmen, it appeared, no longer welcomed him with beer and rejoicing. Rather, he had visited them so often in his festive gear that they had taken to making excuses or rushing off to their fields so as to be conveniently absent when he called. The maids who should be eyeing him with lascivious favour were all wielding hoes under the supervision of eagle-eyed mothers. Young love was a fine thing but getting the crops in took precedence. The ultimate insult had come the other night. Driven to visit ever more distant relatives of ever more tenuous kinship, he had missed the film-show of the hirsute German.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was now evident that the timetable of circumcision was gravely askew. Ideally, the cutting would already have taken place and the boys would now be in seclusion in the bush. It is ritually important that the heavy bleeding of the wounds should coincide with the first heavy showers of rain. The healing and drying of the wounds should coincide with the increasing dryness of the weather. Thus, there would be harmony between men and the world they lived in, both subject to a common rhythm. It did not seem that this pairing could now be preserved.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="显然，割礼的时程表严重偏离正轨。照道理，割礼应当已经举行，男孩此刻该躲到丛林里与人群隔离。根据仪式规矩，男孩割礼伤口流血应与第一阵大雨同时。伤口的复原与干燥则应和气候的逐渐干燥同步。如此，人与他们所居住的世界才能一致和谐、节奏相同。此刻看来，这种同步是不可能了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Even Matthieu was moved. We pooled our resources in an attempt to provide adequate consolation. The best we could manage was a bottle of beer and a Superman comic in French.

<div class="line_en">Since the joint scheduling of human and cosmic change required that the boys would return from their seclusion in the bush on the first day of the harvest, the rest of the rituals would have to be indecently compressed if they were all to be squeezed in and I would again be in trouble with my visa before they could be completed. There is no one person who organizes such things in an acephalous society, no one person with the power and authority to impose his will. Matters of major public concern are allowed to drift until action is forced upon all by press of circumstance or until the moment for action is past so that nothing is ever done. It is comforting that this works so well, a proof that much of the frenzy and purpose of the world is otiose.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was, however, one person who was indispensable to the completion of the ceremonies who would at least be fully in touch with what had and had not been done in the outlying villages -- the rain-chief. It was time for another climb up the mountain where he lived.</div>

<div class="line_en">After the visit to the nippleless Ninga, mountaineering had lost much of its appeal. Dowayo mountains are oddly uncomfortable things. They have not the bracing appeal of hill-climbing as it is known in Europe. On the other hand, to take them as seriously as the Alps would be ridiculous. You are left with the sort of object that can quite easily tumble you several hundred feet on to granite rocks below but somehow has to be approached without even proper boots. At the bottom, they are soggy and full of huge, jagged boulders that involve a deal of scrambling and sliding. In the middle they are full of disconcerting clefts of great depth but no great width. These have to be simply leapt over while hanging on in one's mind to the memory of feats of long-jump performed at school. At the top, they are bare and chill.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dowayos, being profoundly social, will seldom do anything alone that can be done together. As usual, the preparations for our trip had not gone unobserved. As we left the village, we were joined by a rather shamefaced man who was bound for the rain-chief's village for a medical consultation. Everyone knows that the rain-chief is the master of male fertility, so consulting him was probably a tacit declaration of his sterility or impotence. There was much giggling. As we walked along the narrow paths, we picked up various other people, who had decided that they would use our journey to conduct business with the rain-chief. One of his thirteen wives was there with a huge bundle on her head. Most surprising of all, there was Irma.</div>

<div class="line_en">The rain-chief occupied what might elsewhere be viewed as a prime site, a sheltered valley at the top of one peak but in the lee of another. It was green, being blessed with year-round, pure water, cooler than the sweltering plains, well stocked with dwarf cattle (how?) and far from road access for government officials. Even the cross-country motorbikes of the police could not penetrate there, so that apart from one cursory visit by a determined French colonial officer forty years before, the rain-chief dwelt in calm, patriarchal isolation. He had seen, or more accurately been almost unaware of, the decline of the Fulani slavers in the valleys, the passage of the Germans, their replacement by the French, the change to independence. Immutable and granite-like as his mountain, he had survived the many vicissitudes of the century and still sat undisturbed under the rain-cloud that constantly hovered over his village and conveniently designated his own specialization as the man who controlled the weather.</div>

At her feet lay a large, polythene sack of ground millet that was to be repaid to the rain-chief by her father in settlement of some old debt. On top of this were balanced the blue plastic shoes she would only put on to make a grand entrance to the village after scaling the mountain in her bare feet.

<div class="line_en">Our jolliness abated somewhat when we came across the carcass of a large, horned goat rotting in the stream at a crossing point. Smashed and bloody, it had clearly tumbled from one of the paths higher up. Dowayos are much concerned with omens. It appeared that this was a particularly bad one. Their interest centred not on the fact that one who had been high was now laid low, nor in the poignant contrast between a buck in rampant sexuality and his impotence in death. It focused rather on the all-too-obvious fact that the event had occurred so long ago that the flesh was too putrid for the Dowayos to eat -- even though they are inured to consuming meat that could only with polite understatement be termed 'high'.</div>

Could this be the bridge that would lead to some fundamental discovery about an alien culture or the basic nature of the human mind? Almost certainly not but it is impossible to predict in advance what may be important. Flashes of insight have, after all, come to anthropologists in bathrooms, while playing croquet or when dissecting octopuses. The safe response is to file it away in a notebook where it may be found years later, the ink having run from splashes of stream water, the letters smeared with brown thumbprints. The infuriating feeling is 'now that's something an anthropologist could certainly explain'. This almost always is associated with, 'I haven't a clue what that could mean.'</div>

<div class="line_en">The death of the goat caused a good deal of foot-shuffling. It seemed in doubt that we would attempt to scale the mountain at all. It was only when Irma and I had reiterated our resolve to continue, grudgingly backed up by Matthieu, that the party agreed to start up the path. The atmosphere was tense and oppressive, rather like one of those omen scenes in Shakespeare where comets are crashing and earthquakes heaving the dead from their graves. Every time someone stubbed a toe there was a deal of exchanging of glances and nervous looking around. Down below us, vultures had settled on the goat, ripping at its flesh and watching us with tax-inspector's eyes, hostile and speculative. It suddenly occurred to me that this stream was the main source of water for the village and that we should at least move the body away from the flow. Doubts about a major water project for the good of others were one thing. This was the water I drank. No one seemed in the least enthusiastic to touch the cadaver so we left it in a swirl of fetid water.</div>

<div class="line_en">With a beckoning arm, the rain-chief called me over to his patient. Had my prowess in Dowayo herbal medicine been recognized?

While disclaiming all pretension to personal skill in using plant remedies, it placed my wide experience in working with recognized Dowayo healers at the disposal of the afflicted. The major problem in Dowayoland was in knowing whether an illness was 'just' an illness or rather a manifestation of supernatural displeasure or witchcraft. In the latter case, the treatment would be quite different. A few innocent questions from a beginner such as myself would almost always lead to a passionate discussion of fundamental Dowayo notions of causality, morality and classification. What was the trouble? The man's penis was no good. Was he sure it was not because of his brothers? He shook his head. He had used the zepto-rubbing oracle with three different diviners. All had said the same thing. This was 'just' an illness. What had the rain-chief prescribed? More zepto plant that the man would boil in water and drink.</div>

<div class="line_en">A recent concern of anthropology has been with plant classifications, seeking to determine how far other cultures deal in species and sub-species that are comparable to our own and what criteria they use to distinguish between different sorts of 'the same' plant. I had expended much effort collecting leaves and fruits of certain basic plants such as zepto in order that I might prompt a discussion on how to recognize one kind from another. Was it from the shape of the leaf, the formation of the fruit? As before, in the case of the rain-stones, the chief floored me with his positivism. It was not on account of any of these features that they distinguished one type from another. It was simply that one plant cured one disease, another plant cured another. One could not tell which was which in advance of a cure effected by it. He smiled cherubically.

<div class="line_en">But what was it that had happened? In explanation, he uttered a word that was new to me. I looked questioningly at Matthieu who groped unsuccessfully for the French equivalent. With his usual positivist zeal, the rain-chief led us into the fields and just pointed. The millet plants literally boiled with fat, black caterpillars. The young leaves had been completely devoured. The drooping stems were visibly diminishing before our eyes as the beasts munched on. Apparently, all the fields this side of Kongle were similarly afflicted. There would be no harvest worthy of the name this year. If the caterpillars ate all the plants and died, there was hope that a second crop could be planted. But many had no seed left and the yield would be small. Probably the rains would not continue late enough in the next year for the crop to ripen. But what would people do? He shrugged. Some would borrow grain from kin. Others would have to sell their cattle or get into debt with the traders. All the reserves for brewing beer would be needed just to get by. The transformation of boys into men might be a wonder but wonders ran on beer not good intentions. Circumcision would be put back. The scandal of wet, smelly boys would get worse. Even the Ninga would laugh at them.</div>

<div class="line_en">Having raised funds and come so far to document a ceremony that would not, it seemed, occur, I was understandably upset, annoyed -- even embarrassed. Accounts have to be kept, justification -- real or imagined -- has to be given. Soon there would come a point where I would have to write a report to the somewhat stern guardians of the research-funding body who had financed the investigation of the ceremony that would not take place. It was unlikely to go down well.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我好不容易筹到钱、大老远跑来记录一个结果不举行的仪式，我的心烦、懊恼甚至尴尬都是可想而知。我必须交代账目、提出辩护（真实或捏造的）。迟早，我得写一份报告给研究奖助审查委员会，对态度严厉的把关人员解释他们为何资助我去研究一个根本没举行的仪式。结果不会太愉快。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In anthropological research, as in other areas of academic endeavour, little credit is ever gained for negative conclusions, for false trails exposed, dead ends conclusively demonstrated, festivals not witnessed. The whole thing was decidedly awkward. Personally, I had no feeling that the trip had been unproductive. I felt I had learnt just as much during this short visit as I had in the longer previous one. Somehow, the fact of coming back had made the Dowayos, themselves, take me more seriously, as if they had a long history of disappointment through the fickleness of researchers. Whatever their own perception of the matter, they had been much more open and trusting than before.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="人类学研究和其他学术领域相同，否定的结论、发现假线索、盖棺论定的死胡同，以及未经亲眼目睹的仪式，都甚难获得学术肯定。整件事难堪透了。我个人却不觉得此次前来一无建树。此行虽短，我的收获却不下于上次较长的研究。光是我去而复返这件事便让多瓦悠人更加看重我，仿佛善变的人类学家曾让他们饱尝失望滋味。不管他们对人类学研究抱持何种想法，现在他们比较愿意信任我、对我开放。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The chief reaction throughout Dowayoland was a deep surge of embarrassment. Blushing youths were left marooned in their finery like jilted brides at the altar. Quietly divesting themselves of incriminating leopard-skins or fablon, slipping leg-bells into their pockets, those big enough stole away to the fields and resumed hoeing as if they had never put on their dancing costumes. The smaller ones reappeared, shamefaced, in classrooms to be mocked by comrades from other tribes. Wherever men met, it was a subject not to be talked about. For women, it became a new theme in the battle of the sexes, a subject to be used to scorn the uselessness of males. For men, it was a new reason to beat the women. My 'wife' made huge detours around the village to avoid meeting me. Occasions when we inadvertently bumped into each other led to downcast eyes and mumbled salutations. Since the ceremony had not been completed, we were stuck in a ghastly limbo where no one knew how to behave. Were we supposed to joke with each other, show mutual respect, return to our former unconnected state? No one knew. No one had the authority to decide for all, just as no one had been able to organize the ceremony in the first place.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="割礼不举行。整个多瓦多兰陷入极度羞愧。羞红脸的男孩穿戴华丽装饰，无人闻问，独自闲荡，好像在圣坛前被拋弃的新娘。他们静悄脱掉豹皮或 Fallon豹纹装饰，褪下脚环铃铛藏到口袋里。年纪大一点的男孩偷偷跑回田里开始耕作，假装自己从未做过仪式跳舞装扮。小一点的男孩满脸羞愧回到教室，饱受其他族同学嘲笑。男人碰头，绝口不提此事。它却成为女人的两性战争新话题，用以嘲笑男人的无能。而这又成为男人痛揍老婆的理由。我的“老婆”极力避免碰到我，每次都绕大圈进村子。偶尔我们不期而遇，只好低头看地、喃喃说些问候的话。由于割礼仪式并未完成，我们陷入不上不下的状态，不知如何举措。我们应该互相打趣，还是相互表示尊重态度，或者回到先前毫无关联的状态？没有人能给我们答案。没人有足够权威决定一切，就像先前没有人能组织割礼仪式一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In Dowayoland, cattle fell down wells -- an omen. One of Zuuldibo's wives was bitten on the breast by a large bush-rat when she opened her granary -- an omen. On the granite paths, knots of swarming red insects were found -- an omen. No Shakespearean comets plunged across the heavens but there was a small whirlwind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在多瓦悠兰，牛只失足跌落井里，这是恶兆。祖帝保的某个老婆打开谷仓，冲出一只大老鼠咬了她的胸口，也是恶兆。花岗岩小径上出现一群红色昆虫，这也是恶兆。虽然没有莎翁剧里彗星划过天空，但起了一阵小旋风。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A frenzy of omens swept across the country. Suddenly everything seemed topsy-turvy and every event was an omen of bad times coming. It was rather like the way, in our own culture, that a particularly nasty murder seems to focus attention on similar crimes. Suddenly the newspapers are full of them. It seems that the whole of civilization is quite abruptly coming to an end.</div>
