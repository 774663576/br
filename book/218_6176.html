<div class="line_en">Many people may not be satisfied with my ten steps. They see them more as philosophies than actions. I think understanding the philosophy is just as important as the action. There are many people who want to do, instead of think, and then there are people who think but do not do. I would say that I am both. I love new ideas and I love action.</div>

<div class="line_en">Stop doing what you're doing. In other words, take a break and assess what is working and what is not working. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing and expecting a different result. Stop doing what is not working and look for something new to do.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="停下你手头的活儿。换句话说，就是先停下来，评估一下你正在做的事中什么是有效的，什么是无效的。神智不清就是指做同一件事情却希望有不同的结果。不要做那些无效的事情，找一些有效的事情去做。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Look for new ideas. For new investing ideas, I go to bookstores and look for books on different and unique subjects. I call them formulas. I buy how-to books on a formula I know nothing about. For example, it was in the bookstore that I found the book The 16 Percent Solution, by Joel Moskowitz. I bought the book and read it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="寻找新的思想。我经常到书店寻找独特的、与众不同的主张，以从中获得新的投资理念，我把它们称为模式。 我买这种介绍各种“模式”的书籍，这些模式是我所不曾知道的。例如，在书店，我找到了乔尔。莫斯科维茨的（获利率达到16％的方法），我买下了这本书并一口气读完了它。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">TAKE ACTION! The next Thursday, I did exactly as the book said. Step by step. I have also done that with finding real estate bargains in attorneys' offices and in banks. Most people do not take action, or they let someone talk them out of whatever new formula they are studying. My neighbor told me why 16 percent would not work. I did not listen to him because he's never done it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在接下来的星期四，我开始完全按照书上说的话一步一步地行动了。我去律师的办公室和银行寻找房地产廉价交易的机会。大部分人并不采取行动，或者被别人说服，而不去应用所学到的任何新的模式。我的邻居就曾经对我说，16％收益率是不可能实现的，但我没有听他的，因为他从来没有尝试过。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Find someone who has done what you want to do. Take them to lunch. Ask them for tips, for little tricks of the trade. As for 16 percent tax lien certificates, I went to the county tax office and found the government employee who worked in the office. I found out that she, too, invested in the tax liens. Immediately, she was invited to lunch. She was thrilled to tell me everything she knew and how to do it. After lunch, she spent all afternoon showing me everything. By the next day, I found two great properties with her help and have been accruing interest at 16 percent ever since. It took a day to read the book, a day to take action, an hour for lunch, and a day to acquire two great deals.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="找一个做过你想做的事情的人，请他和你一块共进午餐，向他请教一些诀窍和一些做生意的技巧。就拿16％的税收留置权来说吧。我到税务办公室同一位政府雇员见面，我发现她也在做税收留置权投资，于是立即邀请她共进午餐，她也很兴奋地告诉我她所知道的一切有关这种投资的做法。甚至吃过午饭后，她又用了整整一个下午来向我说明全部过程。到了第二天，我就在她的帮助下，找到了两笔大买卖，从此我就能获得每年16％的利息。我花了一天时间来读有关的书籍，用一天来采取行动，用一个小时来吃午饭，又用一天时间找到了两笔大买卖。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Take classes and buy tapes. I search the newspapers for new and interesting classes. Many are for free or a small fee. I also attend and pay for expensive seminars on what I want to learn. I am wealthy and free from needing a job simply because of the courses I took. I have friends who did not take those classes who told me I was wasting my money, and yet they're still at the same job.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="参加辅导班并购买相关磁带。我在报纸上寻找令人感兴趣的新的辅导班广告，有许多是免费的或只收一小笔费用。我也参加一些费用昂贵的研讨班，因为这些研讨班所讨论的内容正是我急于想学习的。就是因为参加学习了这些课程，我才比较富有，不用出去辛苦劳作。我有许多朋友从不参加这种辅导班，他们说我是在浪费钱财，然而他们如今一直在干着同样的工作。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A friend wanted me to show her how to buy apartment houses. So one Saturday she, her agent and I went and looked at six apartment houses. Four were dogs, but two were good. I said to write offers on all six, offering half of what the owners asked for. She and the agent nearly had heart attacks. They thought it would be rude, that I might offend the sellers, but I really don't think the agent wanted to work that hard. So they did nothing and went on looking for a better deal.</div>

<div class="line_en">Moral of the story: Make offers. People who are not investors have no idea what it feels like to be trying to sell something. I have had a piece of real estate that I wanted to sell for months. I would have welcomed anything. I would not care how low the price. They could have offered me ten pigs and I would have been happy. Not at the offer, but just because someone was interested. I would have countered, maybe for a pig farm in exchange. But that's how the game works. The game of buying and selling is fun. Keep that in mind. It's fun and only a game. Make offers. Someone might say "yes."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个故事的主题是：多发出几份报价。没做过卖主的人，对于试图卖出东西的感觉是不会有什么体会的。我有一处房地产，想在数月之内卖掉它，当时我愿意接受任何出价，不会在意价格有多低，即使他们只出价十头猪我也会感到高兴。报价本身并不重要，关键是有人报价就说明有人感兴趣。也许我会反建议以一家养猪场作为交换，不要感到可笑，游戏就是这样运作的。记住，做买卖就是一场游戏，而且还很有趣。报价提出来，就会有某个人说：“同意。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And I always make offers with escape clauses. In real estate, I make an offer with the words "subject to approval of business partner." I never specify who the business partner is. Most people do not know my partner is my cat. If they accept the offer, and I don't want the deal, I call my home and speak to my cat. I make this absurd statement to illustrate how absurdly easy and simple the game is. So many people make things too difficult and take them too seriously.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我还经常使用“回避条款”来做报价。如在房地产交易协议上，我会加上“须得到我的商业伙伴的同意”。我从不指明我的商业伙伴到底是谁，大部分人都不知道我的商业伙伴其实就是我的小猫。如果他们接受我的报价，而我又不想成交的话，我就给家里的小猫打电话。我讲这个荒唐故事的目的就是为了说明，这种买卖游戏简单得难以置信。所以，我觉得许多人态度太严肃，反而把事情弄得太复杂。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">No offers were ever made, and that person is still looking for the "right" deal at the right price. Well, you don't know what the right price is until you have a second party who wants to deal. Most sellers ask too much. It is rare that a seller will actually ask a price that is less than something is worth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后来他们一个报价也没做，而那个人仍然在寻找一笔价格“恰当”的交易。其实，你根本就不知道什么价格才是“恰当”的价格，除非有另一处同样的交易作为参照。大部分卖主的要价过高，很少有卖主的要价低于标的物实际价值的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jog, walk or drive a certain area once a month for ten minutes. I have found some of my best real estate investments while jogging. I will jog a certain neighborhood for a year. What I look for is change. For there to be profit in a deal, there must be two elements: a bargain and change. There are lots of bargains, but it's change that turns a bargain into a profitable opportunity. So when I jog, I jog a neighborhood I might like to invest in. It is the repetition that causes me to notice slight differences. I notice real estate signs that are up for a long time. That means the seller might be more agreeable to deal. I watch for moving trucks, going in or out. I stop and talk to the drivers. I talk to the postal carriers. It's amazing how much information they acquire about an area.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每月在某一地区慢跑、散步或驾车10来分钟，我就会发现那些最好的房地产投资机会。一年来，我常常在邻近地区慢跑，为的是发现某些变化。一桩交易要获得盈利，必须具备两个条件：一是廉价，二是有变化。市场上有许多廉价交易，但只有存在变化时，才能使廉价交易变成有利可图的机会。因此，当我慢跑的时候，我就往有投资可能的地点附近慢跑。通过反复观察，我就能注意到一些细微的差异。我会注意到悬挂了很长时间的房地产卖出招牌，那意味着卖主急于成交。观察到行驶中的卡车进进出出，我会停下来和司机交谈。我还同邮政货车司机谈话，从这些人口中你可以得到有关某一地区详细得令人吃惊的信息。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Finding a good deal, the right business, the right people, the right investors, or whatever is just like dating. You must go to the market and talk to a lot of people, make a lot of offers, counteroffers, negotiate, reject and accept. I know single people who sit at home and wait for the phone to ring, but unless you're Cindy Crawford or Tom Cruise, I think you'd best go to the market, even if it's only the supermarket. Search, offer, reject, negotiate and accept are all parts of the process of almost everything in life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="寻找一桩好的生意，一家好的企业，一个合适的人，一位合适的投资者，或任何类似的东西，就如同约会一样。你必须到市场上去和许多人交谈，做许多报价，还价，谈判，拒绝或者接受。我知道有人宁可在家里坐等电话铃响，但是，除非你是辛迪。克劳馥或汤姆。克鲁斯，否则你最好还是到市场上去，即使只是一家超级市场也罢。从寻找、报价、拒绝、谈判到接受、成交，几乎是人的一生中要经历的全部过程。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I find a bad area, especially an area that the news has scared everyone away from. I drive it for sometimes a year waiting for signs of something changing for the better. I talk to retailers, especially new ones, and find out why they're moving in. It takes only a few minutes a month, and I do it while doing something else, like exercising, or going to and from the store.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我找到一个很差的地区，是那种人人惟恐避之不及的地区。我在一年的时间里不时驱车经过这一区域，以观察某些情形向好的方向变化的标志。我和零售店主交谈，以弄清楚他们尤其是新户迁人的原因。这样做每月只需要花很少时间，同时我还能做其他的事情，比如锻炼身体，或去商店走走看看等。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As for stocks, I like Peter Lynch's book Beating the Street for his formula for selecting stocks that grow in value. I have found that the principles of finding value are the same regardless if it's real estate, stocks, mutual funds, new companies, a new pet, a new home, a new spouse, or a bargain on laundry detergent. The process is always the same. You need to know what you're looking for and then go look for it!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="至于股票，我喜欢彼得。林奇的（称雄华尔街）一书中介绍的选择价值有上升潜力股票的方法。我发现寻找价值增值的方法都是相同的，不管你的投资对象是房地产、股票、共同基金、新公司、新宠物、新房子、新配偶还是一家廉价出售的洗衣店。 程序往往是一致的。你先要知道你在寻找什么，然后再去寻找它！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Why consumers will always be poor. When the supermarket has a sale on, say, toilet paper, the consumer runs in and stocks up. When the stock market has a sale, most often called a crash or correction, the consumer runs away from it. When the supermarket raises its prices, the consumer shops elsewhere. When the stock market raises its prices, the consumer starts buying.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="为什么消费者总是穷人。每当超市有打折销售，如卫生用品打折时，消费者就会涌入超市，抢购回家贮存起来。而当股票市场上出现“降价销售”时，也就是大多数人所说的股市下挫或回调时，购买者却急于从中逃出。当超市涨价时，人们转而到其他商店购物，相反，股市上升时，购买者却对购买股票趋之若鹜。。关注适当的地方。一位邻居以10万美元购买了一项共同管辖权利，我则以5万美元购买了与之相邻的同样权利。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Look in the right places. A neighbor bought a condominium for $100,000. I bought the identical condo next door to his for $50,000. He told me he's waiting for the price to go up. I told him that his profit is made when you buy, not when you sell. He shopped with a real estate broker who owns no property of her own. I shopped at the foreclosure department of a bank. I paid $500 for a class on how to do this. My neighbor thought that the $500 for a real estate investment class was too expensive. He said he could not afford it, and he couldn't afford the time. So he waits for the price to go up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他告诉我他正在等着价格上涨。我对他说你的获利额在你购买时就确定了，而不是在你售出时确定的。他是通过一位房地产经纪人来购买的，而这位经纪人却并未拥有属于他自己的房产。而我是在一家银行的破产清偿部购买的。我支付500美元上了一个班，这个班是专门讲如何做这种交易的。我的邻居认为花500美元上这样一个讲房地产投资的班未免太贵了，他说他付不起钱，也没有时间，所以，他就指望着价格会上升。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I look for people who want to buy first, then I look for someone who wants to sell. A friend was looking for a certain piece of land. He had the money and did not have the time. I found a large piece of land larger than what my friend wanted to buy, tied it up with an option, called my friend and he wanted a piece of it. So I sold the piece to him and then bought the land. I kept the remaining land as mine for free. Moral of the story: Buy the pie and cut it in pieces. Most people look for what they can afford, so they look too small. They buy only a piece of the pie, so they end up paying more for less. Small thinkers don't get the big breaks. If you want to get richer, think bigger first.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我首先寻找想买人的人，然后才去找想卖出的人。一位朋友想买一片地产，他有钱，但是没时间去找。我发现了一处地产，比我的朋友想要的面积要大一些。我问朋友要不要，他表示愿意要其中的一片，于是我把那一片出售给他，然后用很少的钱买下了其余土地，我把剩下的土地保持在手上作一种收益。这个故事的实质是：买下馅饼并把它切成小块。大部分人寻找的是自己能够支付的东西，这样他们看到的都是较小的东西。他们只购买一块馅饼，却因此付出更多。只盯着小生意的人是不会有大的突破的。如果你想致富，就要首先考虑较大的生意。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Retailers love giving volume discounts, simply because most business people love big spenders. So even if you're small, you can always think big. When my company was in the market for computers, I called several friends and asked them if they were ready to buy also. We then went to different dealers and negotiated a great deal because we wanted to buy so many. I have done the same with stocks. Small people remain small because they think small; act alone, or don't act all.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="零售商喜欢提供数量折扣，就是因为大部分商人喜欢大额购买者。所以即使你的投资规模很小，你也可以多考虑大生意。当我的公司想在市场上购买电脑时，我就通知几位朋友，如果他们也准备买电脑的话，我们可以一起买。接着我们到不同的零售商那里，去磋商这笔大买卖，因为我们一共需要那么多的电脑，我们就可以选择最适宜的价格，我也以同样的方式做股票。小规模投资人擅于小规模动作，因为他们思考的数量很小，他们或者单干，或者根本就不干。">查看中文翻译</div>
