<div class="line_en">After having run for some time at the top of his speed, without knowing whither, knocking his head against many a street corner, leaping many a gutter, traversing many an alley, many a court, many a square, seeking flight and passage through all the meanderings of the ancient passages of the Halles, exploring in his panic terror what the fine Latin of the maps calls tota via, cheminum et viaria, our poet suddenly halted for lack of breath in the first place, and in the second, because he had been collared, after a fashion, by a dilemma which had just occurred to his mind. "It strikes me, Master Pierre Gringoire," he said to himself, placing his finger to his brow, "that you are running like a madman. The little scamps are no less afraid of you than you are of them. It strikes me, I say, that you heard the clatter of their wooden shoes fleeing southward, while you were fleeing northward. Now, one of two things, either they have taken flight, and the pallet, which they must have forgotten in their terror, is precisely that hospitable bed in search of which you have been running ever since morning, and which madame the Virgin miraculously sends you, in order to recompense you for having made a morality in her honor, accompanied by triumphs and mummeries; or the children have not taken flight, and in that case they have put the brand to the pallet, and that is precisely the good fire which you need to cheer, dry, and warm you. In either case, good fire or good bed, that straw pallet is a gift from heaven. The blessed Virgin Marie who stands at the corner of the Rue Mauconseil, could only have made Eustache Moubon die for that express purpose; and it is folly on your part to flee thus zigzag, like a Picard before a Frenchman, leaving behind you what you seek before you; and you are a fool!"</div>

<div class="line_en">This exclamation afforded him a little solace, and a sort of reddish reflection which he caught sight of at that moment, at the extremity of a long and narrow lane, completed the elevation of his moral tone. "God be praised!" said he, "There it is yonder! There is my pallet burning." And comparing himself to the pilot who suffers shipwreck by night, "Salve," he added piously, "salve, maris stella!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="叫了一声，心里轻快些了。这时又正好瞅见一条狭长小巷的尽头有个什么红光在闪耀，他的情绪也就更高了。他说：“赞美上帝呀！就是那边！是我的草垫子在燃烧。”于是，他自比为在黑夜中迷失方向的舟子，虔诚地又说：“Salve，salve，maris stella！（48）”【注：（48）拉丁文，致敬，致敬，导航星！】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then he retraced his steps, and feeling his way and searching, with his nose to the wind and his ears on the alert, he tried to find the blessed pallet again, but in vain. There was nothing to be found but intersections of houses, closed courts, and crossings of streets, in the midst of which he hesitated and doubted incessantly, being more perplexed and entangled in this medley of streets than he would have been even in the labyrinth of the Hôtel des Tournelles. At length he lost patience, and exclaimed solemnly: "Cursed be cross roads! 'tis the devil who has made them in the shape of his pitchfork!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，他向后转去，摸索着方向，鼻子向前伸，耳朵竖起来，竭力寻找赐福的草垫子。可是白费了劲，只见房屋交错，大街小巷盘结，他不断迟疑，拿不定主意，在这黑暗胡同纠结纷乱之中进退不得，踟蹰不前，即使陷入小塔府邸的迷宫也不过如此。终于，他失去了耐心，庄严地喊叫：“该死的街道交叉！是魔鬼按照自己的脚爪的模样造出来的！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He had taken but a few steps in the long street, which sloped downwards, was unpaved, and more and more muddy and steep, when he noticed a very singular thing. It was not deserted; here and there along its extent crawled certain vague and formless masses, all directing their course towards the light which flickered at the end of the street, like those heavy insects which drag along by night, from blade to blade of grass, towards the shepherd's fire.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这条狭长胡同是顺坡而下的。没有铺石子，越走越泥泞、倾斜，进去没走几步，他就发现有个很古怪的现象：这条小巷并不是渺无人影的。一路过去，间隔着，有些难以言状的模糊不清、奇形怪状的东西匍匐着，一个个都在爬向街尽头摇曳着的那点亮光，就像笨重的昆虫夜里从一根草茎到一根草茎向牧童的篝火爬去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Nothing renders one so adventurous as not being able to feel the place where one's pocket is situated. Gringoire continued to advance, and had soon joined that one of the forms which dragged along most indolently, behind the others. On drawing near, he perceived that it was nothing else than a wretched legless cripple in a bowl, who was hopping along on his two hands like a wounded field-spider which has but two legs left. At the moment when he passed close to this species of spider with a human countenance, it raised towards him a lamentable voice: "La buona mancia, signor! la buona mancia!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最使人富于冒险精神的，莫过于不担心有什么东西可以被人抢去。格兰古瓦继续前行，快要贴近这些毛毛虫中间爬得最慢、落在后面的那一个了。走过去才看出，这玩艺儿不是别的，而是一个可怜的无腿人，使用两只手蹦着，好像是一只受伤的只剩下两只脚的细腿大蜘蛛。他走到这只人面蜘蛛跟前，它向他抬起头来，可怜巴巴地叫喊：“La buona mancia，sgnor！La buona mancia！（49）”【注：（49）意大利语，老爷，行行好吧！行行好吧！】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He overtook another of these itinerant masses, and examined it. It was an impotent man, both halt and crippled, and halt and crippled to such a degree that the complicated system of crutches and wooden legs which sustained him, gave him the air of a mason's scaffolding on the march. Gringoire, who liked noble and classical comparisons, compared him in thought to the living tripod of Vulcan.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他又赶上了一堆这类爬行物，向其中一个仔细一瞧，原来是一个又缺胳臂又缺腿的残废。此人的拐杖和木头腿各种装置极为复杂，支撑着他，好似盖房子的脚手架自己在挪动。格兰古瓦满脑子都是庄严的古典譬喻，于是心里就把它比作火神的大鼎镬的化身。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was minded to augment his pace, but for the third time something barred his way. This something or, rather, some one was a blind man, a little blind fellow with a bearded, Jewish face, who, rowing away in the space about him with a stick, and towed by a large dog, droned through his nose with a Hungarian accent: "Facitote caritatem!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他想加快步伐，但是，第三次又有个什么东西挡住了去路。这个什么东西，更恰当地说，这个什么人，是个瞎子，一个长着犹太人大胡子的小个子瞎子，他伸出一根棍子向四周乱划，由一只大狗带领着，他发出的鼻音就跟说匈牙利话似的：“Facitote caritatem！（51）”【注：（51）拉丁文，行行好吧！】">查看中文翻译</div>

I must have a very charitable aspect, since they ask alms of me in the present lean condition of my purse.

<div class="line_en">The poor poet cast his eyes about him. It was, in truth, that redoubtable Cour des Miracles, whither an honest man had never penetrated at such an hour; the magic circle where the officers of the Châtelet and the sergeants of the provostship, who ventured thither, disappeared in morsels; a city of thieves, a hideous wart on the face of Paris; a sewer, from which escaped every morning, and whither returned every night to crouch, that stream of vices, of mendicancy and vagabondage which always overflows in the streets of capitals; a monstrous hive, to which returned at nightfall, with their booty, all the drones of the social order; a lying hospital where the bohemian, the disfrocked monk, the ruined scholar, the ne'er-do-wells of all nations, Spaniards, Italians, Germans, -- of all religions, Jews, Christians, Mahometans, idolaters, covered with painted sores, beggars by day, were transformed by night into brigands; an immense dressing-room, in a word, where, at that epoch, the actors of that eternal comedy, which theft, prostitution, and murder play upon the pavements of Paris, dressed and undressed.</div>

<div class="line_en">The poor and flickering flames of the fire permitted Gringoire to distinguish, amid his trouble, all around the immense place, a hideous frame of ancient houses, whose wormeaten, shrivelled, stunted façades, each pierced with one or two lighted attic windows, seemed to him, in the darkness, like enormous heads of old women, ranged in a circle, monstrous and crabbed, winking as they looked on at the Witches' Sabbath.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a vast place, irregular and badly paved, like all the squares of Paris at that date. Fires, around which swarmed strange groups, blazed here and there. Every one was going, coming, and shouting. Shrill laughter was to be heard, the wailing of children, the voices of women. The hands and heads of this throng, black against the luminous background, outlined against it a thousand eccentric gestures. At times, upon the ground, where trembled the light of the fires, mingled with large, indefinite shadows, one could behold a dog passing, which resembled a man, a man who resembled a dog. The limits of races and species seemed effaced in this city, as in a pandemonium. Men, women, beasts, age, sex, health, maladies, all seemed to be in common among these people; all went together, they mingled, confounded, superposed; each one there participated in all.</div>

<div class="line_en">While traversing the horrible place, his vertigo vanished. After taking a few steps, the sentiment of reality returned to him. He began to become accustomed to the atmosphere of the place. At the first moment there had arisen from his poet's head, or, simply and prosaically, from his empty stomach, a mist, a vapor, so to speak, which, spreading between objects and himself, permitted him to catch a glimpse of them only in the incoherent fog of nightmare, -- in those shadows of dreams which distort every outline, agglomerating objects into unwieldy groups, dilating things into chimeras, and men into phantoms. Little by little, this hallucination was succeeded by a less bewildered and exaggerating view. Reality made its way to the light around him, struck his eyes, struck his feet, and demolished, bit by bit, all that frightful poetry with which he had, at first, believed himself to be surrounded. He was forced to perceive that he was not walking in the Styx, but in mud, that he was elbowed not by demons, but by thieves; that it was not his soul which was in question, but his life (since he lacked that precious conciliator, which places itself so effectually between the bandit and the honest man -- a purse). In short, on examining the orgy more closely, and with more coolness, he fell from the witches' sabbath to the dram-shop.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="穿过可怕的广场，他头晕目眩的感觉消失了。刚走了几步，现实感也恢复了。他开始适应这里的气氛。最初，从他那诗人的脑袋里，——也许，干干脆脆，十分散文式地，是从他那空空的肚皮里，升起了一道烟雾，或者说，一道水汽，扩散着，挡住了物体，只让他隐隐约约看见：在那若隐若现的噩梦迷雾中，在那使得一切轮廓抖动、一切形体扭曲、一切物体壅积为无比巨大群团的梦幻黑暗中，物膨胀成为幻相绰绰，人膨胀成为鬼影憧憧。经过了这样一番幻觉丛生之后，目光渐渐不再迷乱，也不再放大一切了。真实世界缓缓在他周围显现，撞击着他的双眼，撞击着他的双脚，一片又一片拆毁了他起初以为受其围困的那种种恐怖的诗情幻景。他不能不看清楚了并不是涉行于冥河，而是辗转于泥污，推搡着他的并不是魔鬼，而是盗贼，岌岌可危的并不是他的灵魂，而干脆就是他的性命——既然他缺乏那个宝贵的调解者，能够非常有效地撮合强盗和好人的那玩艺儿，即金钱！他更仔细地，也更冷静地考察这里的狂乱景象，终于从群魔会一交跌入了下等酒店。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Around a great fire which burned on a large, circular flagstone, the flames of which had heated red-hot the legs of a tripod, which was empty for the moment, some wormeaten tables were placed, here and there, haphazard, no lackey of a geometrical turn having deigned to adjust their parallelism, or to see to it that they did not make too unusual angles. Upon these tables gleamed several dripping pots of wine and beer, and round these pots were grouped many bacchic visages, purple with the fire and the wine. There was a man with a huge belly and a jovial face, noisily kissing a woman of the town, thickset and brawny. There was a sort of sham soldier, a "naquois," as the slang expression runs, who was whistling as he undid the bandages from his fictitious wound, and removing the numbness from his sound and vigorous knee, which had been swathed since morning in a thousand ligatures. On the other hand, there was a wretched fellow, preparing with celandine and beef's blood, his "leg of God," for the next day. Two tables further on, a palmer, with his pilgrim's costume complete, was practising the lament of the Holy Queen, not forgetting the drone and the nasal drawl. Further on, a young scamp was taking a lesson in epilepsy from an old pretender, who was instructing him in the art of foaming at the mouth, by chewing a morsel of soap. Beside him, a man with the dropsy was getting rid of his swelling, and making four or five female thieves, who were disputing at the same table, over a child who had been stolen that evening, hold their noses.</div>

<div class="line_en">Clopin made a sign. Several thieves detached themselves from the circle, and returned a moment later. They brought two thick posts, terminated at their lower extremities in spreading timber supports, which made them stand readily upon the ground; to the upper extremity of the two posts they fitted a cross-beam, and the whole constituted a very pretty portable gibbet, which Gringoire had the satisfaction of beholding rise before him, in a twinkling.

<div class="line_en">"What are they going to do?" Gringoire asked himself with some uneasiness. A sound of bells, which he heard at that moment, put an end to his anxiety; it was a stuffed manikin, which the vagabonds were suspending by the neck from the rope, a sort of scarecrow dressed in red, and so hung with mule-bells and larger bells, that one might have tricked out thirty Castilian mules with them. These thousand tiny bells quivered for some time with the vibration of the rope, then gradually died away, and finally became silent when the manikin had been brought into a state of immobility by that law of the pendulum which has dethroned the water clock and the hour-glass.</div>
