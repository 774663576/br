<div class="line_en">In any society built on institutionalized racism, race-mixing doesn't merely challenge the system as unjust, it reveals the system as unsustainable and incoherent. Race-mixing proves that races can mix -- and in a lot of cases, want to mix. Because a mixed person embodies that rebuke to the logic of the system, race-mixing becomes a crime worse than treason.</div>

<div class="line_en">I grew up in South Africa during apartheid, which was awkward because I was raised in a mixed family, with me being the mixed one in the family. My mother, Patricia Nombuyiselo Noah, is black. My father, Robert, is white. Swiss/German, to be precise, which Swiss/Germans invariably are. During apartheid, one of the worst crimes you could commit was having sexual relations with a person of another race. Needless to say, my parents committed that crime.</div>

<div class="line_en">Humans being humans and sex being sex, that prohibition never stopped anyone. There were mixed kids in South Africa nine months after the first Dutch boats hit the beach in Table Bay. Just like in America, the colonists here had their way with the native women, as colonists so often do. Unlike in America, where anyone with one drop of black blood automatically became black, in South Africa mixed people came to be classified as their own separate group, neither black nor white but what we call "colored." Colored people, black people, white people, and Indian people were forced to register their race with the government. Based on those classifications, millions of people were uprooted and relocated. Indian areas were segregated from colored areas, which were segregated from black areas -- all of them segregated from white areas and separated from one another by buffer zones of empty land. Laws were passed prohibiting sex between Europeans and natives, laws that were later amended to prohibit sex between whites and all nonwhites.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="人是人，性是性，禁令并不能阻止什么。荷兰的船在塔布尔湾靠岸后的第九个月，南非就迎来了第一波混血儿的降生。就像在美洲那样，这里的殖民者也知道怎么勾搭本地女人，所有的殖民者似乎都对此驾轻就熟。但和美国不同的是，那里的人只要身上带有一丁点儿黑人的血统，他就会被认定为黑人。而在南非，混血儿被当作是一个单独的种群，不是黑人，也不是白人，而是“有色人种”。政府强迫人民将自己的血统记录在案，有色人种、黑人、白人、印度人，根据这些种族区分，数百万人被迫背井离乡，按规定重新安置自己的家。印度人聚居区和有色人种聚居区要分开，有色人种聚居区要和黑人聚居区分开，而他们这几类人全部要和白人社区分开，中间还要隔出一片空无人烟的缓冲地带。之前的法律规定的是严禁欧洲人和本地原住民发生性关系，之后不久，这条法律就修订为，严禁白人和所有非白人发生性关系。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">If you ask my mother whether she ever considered the ramifications of having a mixed child under apartheid, she will say no. She wanted to do something, figured out a way to do it, and then she did it. She had a level of fearlessness that you have to possess to take on something like she did. If you stop to consider the ramifications, you'll never do anything. Still, it was a crazy, reckless thing to do. A million things had to go right for us to slip through the cracks the way we did for as long as we did.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果你问我妈，她有没有考虑过在种族隔离政策下生一个混血儿的后果，她会说，没有。要是她想做什么事，她就想方设法去做，然后她就做到了。你得先拥有她身上的那种无畏精神，才能做出她所做的那些决定。如果你稍有迟疑，稍微顾虑一下结果，那你什么也做不了。尽管如此，这依然是一件疯狂且不计后果的事。长久以来，为了维持日常生活的正常，我们要在一万件事情上如履薄冰。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The government went to insane lengths to try to enforce these new laws. The penalty for breaking them was five years in prison. There were whole police squads whose only job was to go around peeking through windows -- clearly an assignment for only the finest law enforcement officers. And if an interracial couple got caught, God help them. The police would kick down the door, drag the people out, beat them, arrest them. At least that's what they did to the black person. With the white person it was more like, "Look, I'll just say you were drunk, but don't do it again, eh? Cheers." That's how it was with a white man and a black woman. If a black man was caught having sex with a white woman, he'd be lucky if he wasn't charged with rape.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="人是人，性是性。政府为了推行这项新法律也是大费周折。违反了这个法条的处罚是蹲五年监狱。有专门的警察小队，别的什么也不管，成天就在别人家后窗边儿上瞄来瞄去——很明显，这类警察自己一定严守法规，才能得以委任。如果一对跨种族的情侣被抓，那就只有祈祷上帝来帮他们了。警察会踢开他们家门，把他俩拖出去，暴打一顿，再带回监狱。至少他们对情侣中的那个黑人会这么做，对于另一个白人，他们会说：“呃，看啊，我就说你喝醉了，下不为例，懂了吗？拜拜。”这一般指的是白种男人和黑人妇女的情况。如果抓到一个黑人男子和一个白人妇女发生了关系，男方要不被指控为强奸都算走运。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the early 1980s, the South African government began making minor reforms in an attempt to quell international protest over the atrocities and human rights abuses of apartheid. Among those reforms was the token hiring of black workers in low-level white-collar jobs. Like typists. Through an employment agency she got a job as a secretary at ICI, a multinational pharmaceutical company in Braamfontein, a suburb of Johannesburg.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="20世纪80年代初，为了缓解国际社会对国内暴乱的抗议和对种族隔离侵犯人权的指责，南非政府开始做出一些小小的改变。在这些改变措施中，有一项就是开始在一些低级的白领工作岗位上雇佣黑人，譬如打字员。通过职业介绍所，我妈找了一份秘书的工作，雇主是ICI，一家跨国制药公司，工作地点在约翰内斯堡郊区的布朗芳田。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Under apartheid, if you were a black man you worked on a farm or in a factory or in a mine. If you were a black woman, you worked in a factory or as a maid. Those were pretty much your only options. My mother didn't want to work in a factory. She was a horrible cook and never would have stood for some white lady telling her what to do all day. So, true to her nature, she found an option that was not among the ones presented to her: She took a secretarial course, a typing class. At the time, a black woman learning how to type was like a blind person learning how to drive. It's an admirable effort, but you're unlikely to ever be called upon to execute the task. By law, white-collar jobs and skilled-labor jobs were reserved for whites. Black people didn't work in offices. My mom, however, was a rebel, and, fortunately for her, her rebellion came along at the right moment.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在种族隔离制度下，如果你是一名黑人，而且又是个男人，那你的工作范围将会是农场、工厂或矿区。如果你是一位黑人女性，你会是工厂女工或女佣。这些是你仅有的人生选项。我母亲不想在工厂工作，又不擅长煮饭，也无法忍受每天被白人雇主使唤来使唤去。所以，根据她的性格，她做出了一个以上既有选项之外的选择：她报名参加了秘书培训课，学习打字。在那时，黑人女性学打字，等同于盲人想学开车。这份努力值得尊敬，但是你不太可能会因为拥有这项技能而找到工作。根据法律，白领和技工的工作都是留给白人的，黑人不能在办公室工作。但是，我妈却是个反叛者，而且很幸运的是，她的反叛恰巧赶上了好时候。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The ultimate goal of apartheid was to make South Africa a white country, with every black person stripped of his or her citizenship and relocated to live in the homelands, the Bantustans, semi-sovereign black territories that were in reality puppet states of the government in Pretoria. But this so-called white country could not function without black labor to produce its wealth, which meant black people had to be allowed to live near white areas in the townships, government-planned ghettos built to house black workers, like Soweto. The township was where you lived, but your status as a laborer was the only thing that permitted you to stay there. If your papers were revoked for any reason, you could be deported back to the homelands.</div>

<div class="line_en">To leave the township for work in the city, or for any other reason, you had to carry a pass with your ID number; otherwise you could be arrested. There was also a curfew: After a certain hour, blacks had to be back home in the township or risk arrest. My mother didn't care. She was determined to never go home again. So she stayed in town, hiding and sleeping in public restrooms until she learned the rules of navigating the city from the other black women who had contrived to live there: prostitutes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="离开小镇到城市去，不论是去工作或去干别的，你都要带好写有身份证号码的通行证，否则就会被逮捕。另外还有宵禁，到了一个特定时间，所有黑人都必须回到位于小镇上的家中，否则也会被逮捕。我母亲完全不在乎这些，她已经铁了心再也不要回家。所以留在了城里，躲藏在公共厕所过夜，之后，她从一个特别的群体那里学到了操控城市生活的规则，那群人也是硬要留在城市中的黑人妇女：妓女。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Many of the prostitutes in town were Xhosa. They spoke my mother's language and showed her how to survive. They taught her how to dress up in a pair of maid's overalls to move around the city without being questioned. They also introduced her to white men who were willing to rent out flats in town. A lot of these men were foreigners, Germans and Portuguese who didn't care about the law and were happy to sign a lease giving a prostitute a place to live and work in exchange for a steady piece on the side. My mom wasn't interested in any such arrangement, but thanks to her job she did have money to pay rent. She met a German fellow through one of her prostitute friends, and he agreed to let her a flat in his name. She moved in and bought a bunch of maid's overalls to wear. She was caught and arrested many times, for not having her ID on the way home from work, for being in a white area after hours. The penalty for violating the pass laws was thirty days in jail or a fine of fifty rand, nearly half her monthly salary. She would scrape together the money, pay the fine, and go right back about her business.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="城市里很多妓女都是科萨人。她们和我母亲说着同样的语言，并教会了她如何在城市中生存。她们教她穿上女佣的连体工服，这样在城里走动就不会被拦下来质询。她们给她介绍愿意出租公寓给她的白人房东。这类房东通常是外国人，譬如德国人或者葡萄牙人，他们并不在乎禁止跨种族发生关系的法条，很乐意把公寓分租给妓女，并且还能偶尔和她们上上床。好在我母亲有工作，付得起房租，所以对这类交易并不感兴趣。经一位妓女朋友的介绍，她认识了一个德国人，愿意把自己的一套公寓租给她。她搬进了新家，买了几套女佣工服。不过，她时不时还是会被抓，原因是下班路上没带身份卡，或者在白人社区停留太久。等待她的惩罚就是要么蹲三十天牢，要么交五十兰特的罚金，相当于她半个月的工资。她会东拼西凑地凑齐罚金，交了钱后直接回去上班。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">My mom's secret flat was in a neighborhood called Hillbrow. She lived in number 203. Down the corridor was a tall, brown-haired, brown-eyed Swiss/German expat named Robert. He lived in 206. As a former trading colony, South Africa has always had a large expatriate community. People find their way here. Tons of Germans. Lots of Dutch. Hillbrow at the time was the Greenwich Village of South Africa. It was a thriving scene, cosmopolitan and liberal. There were galleries and underground theaters where artists and performers dared to speak up and criticize the government in front of integrated crowds. There were restaurants and nightclubs, a lot of them foreign-owned, that served a mixed clientele, black people who hated the status quo and white people who simply thought it ridiculous. These people would have secret get-togethers, too, usually in someone's flat or in empty basements that had been converted into clubs. Integration by its nature was a political act, but the get-togethers themselves weren't political at all. People would meet up and hang out, have parties.</div>

<div class="line_en">My mom threw herself into that scene. She was always out at some club, some party, dancing, meeting people. She was a regular at the Hillbrow Tower, one of the tallest buildings in Africa at that time. It had a nightclub with a rotating dance floor on the top floor. It was an exhilarating time but still dangerous. Sometimes the restaurants and clubs would get shut down, sometimes not. Sometimes the performers and patrons would get arrested, sometimes not. It was a roll of the dice. My mother never knew whom to trust, who might turn her in to the police. Neighbors would report on one another. The girlfriends of the white men in my mom's block of flats had every reason to report a black woman -- a prostitute, no doubt -- living among them. And you must remember that black people worked for the government as well. As far as her white neighbors knew, my mom could have been a spy posing as a prostitute posing as a maid, sent into Hillbrow to inform on whites who were breaking the law. That's how a police state works -- everyone thinks everyone else is the police.</div>

And he hadn't, but once I existed he realized he couldn't have a son living around the corner and not be a part of my life. So the three of us formed a kind of family, as much as our peculiar situation would allow. I lived with my mom. We'd sneak around and visit my dad when we could.</div>

Under apartheid, the government labeled everything on your birth certificate: race, tribe, nationality. Everything had to be categorized.

<div class="line_en">Where most children are proof of their parents' love, I was the proof of their criminality. The only time I could be with my father was indoors. If we left the house, he'd have to walk across the street from us. My mom and I used to go to Joubert Park all the time. It's the Central Park of Johannesburg -- beautiful gardens, a zoo, a giant chessboard with human-sized pieces that people would play. My mother tells me that once, when I was a toddler, my dad tried to go with us. We were in the park, he was walking a good bit away from us, and I ran after him, screaming, "Daddy! Daddy! Daddy!"

<div class="line_en">My mom, same as she'd done with her flat and with her maid's uniforms, found the cracks in the system. It was illegal to be mixed (to have a black parent and a white parent), but it was not illegal to be colored (to have two parents who were both colored). So my mom moved me around the world as a colored child. She found a crèche in a colored area where she could leave me while she was at work. There was a colored woman named Queen who lived in our block of flats. When we wanted to go out to the park, my mom would invite her to go with us. Queen would walk next to me and act like she was my mother, and my mother would walk a few steps behind, like she was the maid working for the colored woman. I've got dozens of pictures of me walking with this woman who looks like me but who isn't my mother. And the black woman standing behind us who looks like she's photobombing the picture, that's my mom. When we didn't have a colored woman to walk with us, my mom would risk walking me on her own. She would hold my hand or carry me, but if the police showed up she would have to drop me and pretend I wasn't hers, like I was a bag of weed.</div>

<div class="line_en">Soweto was designed to be bombed -- that's how forward-thinking the architects of apartheid were. The township was a city unto itself, with a population of nearly one million. There were only two roads in and out. That was so the military could lock us in, quell any rebellion. And if the monkeys ever went crazy and tried to break out of their cage, the air force could fly over and bomb the shit out of everyone. Growing up, I never knew that my grandmother lived in the center of a bull's-eye.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="索韦托的设计思路就是要人口爆炸——这体现了那些种族隔离设计师们的远见。小镇本身是一个城市的体量，人口数量接近一百万人，但进出小镇就只有两条路。这样的话，军队就可以轻易地将我们锁在里面，有助于平息任何暴乱。假如这群野蛮猴子发了狂，想要冲破牢笼，空军就可以过来扔几个炸弹，把所有人炸得屁滚尿流。在成长过程里，我从未意识到我的外婆就住在靶子的中心。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the city, as difficult as it was to get around, we managed. Enough people were out and about, black, white, and colored, going to and from work, that we could get lost in the crowd. But only black people were permitted in Soweto. It was much harder to hide someone who looked like me, and the government was watching much more closely. In the white areas you rarely saw the police, and if you did it was Officer Friendly in his collared shirt and pressed pants. In Soweto the police were an occupying army. They didn't wear collared shirts. They wore riot gear. They were militarized. They operated in teams known as flying squads, because they would swoop in out of nowhere, riding in armored personnel carriers -- hippos, we called them -- tanks with enormous tires and slotted holes in the side of the vehicle to fire their guns out of. You didn't mess with a hippo. You saw one, you ran. That was a fact of life. The township was in a constant state of insurrection; someone was always marching or protesting somewhere and had to be suppressed. Playing in my grandmother's house, I'd hear gunshots, screams, tear gas being fired into crowds.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在城里住，尽管出行艰难，我们还是可以想办法解决。因为城里人多，黑人、白人、有色人，大家上班下班，我们藏在人群里不会很显眼。但是索韦托只有黑人。像我这种肤色的人，藏起来会很困难，而且政府在那里查得更严。在白人区，你很少会看到警察，即使看到也是那种文质彬彬的警官，穿着立领衬衫和制服裤子。在索韦托，警察是随处可见的军队。他们不穿立领衬衫，而是用防爆装备全副武装。他们是军人。他们的队伍被称为闪电特攻队，只要需要，他们可以立刻不知道从何处钻出来，驾驶着装甲车——我们称之为“河马”——一种装有巨型轮胎的坦克，侧面还有长圆孔的切口，枪支可以从里面伸出来扫射。你绝不能和“河马”闹着玩。你看到它，就得跑。这是生活的真谛。小镇上冲突不断：总有人在哪里游行抗议，总有人在镇压游行抗议。在外婆家玩的时候，我常常听见枪炮声、尖叫声，还有催泪瓦斯丢进人群的爆炸声。">查看中文翻译</div>

I never saw the police before that, because we could never risk the police seeing me. Whenever we went to Soweto, my grandmother refused to let me outside. If she was watching me it was, "No, no, no. He doesn't leave the house." Behind the wall, in the yard, I could play, but not in the street. And that's where the rest of the boys and girls were playing, in the street.

Our stories start off identically. We're around the same age. Their parents met at some underground party in Hillbrow or Cape Town. They lived in an illegal flat.
