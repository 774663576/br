<div class="line_en">I remember seeing him for the first time in front of the Carvel on Amesfort Avenue when I was about five or six. Me and Veronica, my babysitter, were sitting on the bench outside the store with Jamie, my baby brother, who was sitting in his stroller facing us. I guess I was busy eating my ice cream cone, because I didn't even notice the people who sat down next to us.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then at one point I turned my head to suck the ice cream out of the bottom of my cone, and that's when I saw him: August. He was sitting right next to me. I know it wasn't cool, but I kind of went "Uhh!" when I saw him because I honestly got scared. I thought he was wearing a zombie mask or something. It was the kind of "uhh" you say when you're watching a scary movie and the bad guy like jumps out of the bushes. Anyway, I know it wasn't nice of me to do that, and though the kid didn't hear me, I know his sister did.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后，等我歪着头舔干净蛋筒底部时，我才一眼看到他：他就是奥古斯特。他紧挨我坐着。我知道这很夸张，但事实是我不由自主地“啊”了一声。老实说我被吓了一跳。我还以为他戴着一副僵尸面具什么的呢。这就像看恐怖片的时候，看见坏人从密林中跳出来，你会不由自主地“啊”一声。无论如何，我知道自己这样做很不好，我也知道这男孩没听到，但他姐姐听到了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Jack! We have to go!" said Veronica. She had gotten up and was turning the stroller around because Jamie, who had obviously just noticed the kid, too, was about to say something embarrassing. So I jumped up kind of suddenly, like a bee had landed on me, and followed Veronica as she zoomed away. I could hear the kid's mom saying softly behind us: "Okay, guys, I think it's time to go," and I turned around to look at them one more time. The kid was licking his ice cream cone, the mom was picking up his scooter, and the sister was glaring at me like she was going to kill me. I looked away quickly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“杰克！我们得走了！”维罗妮卡说。她已经站起身，将推车掉了个头，因为显然杰米刚才也注意到了他，正要说让人难堪的话。于是我匆匆忙忙地跳起来，像有一只蜜蜂落到我身上一样，跟着维罗妮卡快步走开了。我能听到那男孩的妈妈在我们身后温柔地说：“好啦，孩子们，我想我们该走了。”我转过身再看他们时，男孩正舔着冰淇淋蛋卷，妈妈在收拾他的滑板车，而他的姐姐却对我怒目以视，好像要杀了我似的。我赶紧扭头。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Hush, boy!" she said, her voice angry. I love Veronica, but when she got mad, she got mad. Meanwhile, Jamie was practically spilling out of his stroller trying to get another look as Veronica pushed him away.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“嘘！臭小子！”她怒气冲冲地说。我爱维罗妮卡，但是她生气时，就会发脾气。同时，就在维罗妮卡推着推车往前走的时候，杰米几乎挣出身子来，试图想再看一眼。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我们就这样子走开，”维罗妮卡在喃喃自语，“噢！上帝，那个女人真可怜。我告诉你们，孩子们。我们每天都应该感谢主赐福于我们，听见了吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Jack, sometimes you don't have to mean to hurt someone to hurt someone. You understand?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“杰克，有时候你不一定要故意伤害人才会伤害人。懂吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It was bad how we did that," she said. "Just getting up like that, like we'd just seen the devil. I was scared for what Jamie was going to say, you know? I didn't want him to say anything that would hurt that little boy's feelings. But it was very bad, us leaving like that. The momma knew what was going on."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们这么做太糟糕了，”她说，“就那样站起来，好像活见鬼似的。你知道吗，我生怕杰米会说些什么。我不想让他说任何会伤害那个小男孩的话。但是太糟糕了，我们就这样子走开。他的妈妈全都看在眼里。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And whenever I've seen him, I try to remember what Veronica said. But it's hard. It's hard not to sneak a second look. It's hard to act normal when you see him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不论何时见到他，我都会想起维罗妮卡说过的话。但是很难。很难不偷偷地多看他一眼。见到他的时候，你很难表现正常。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That was the first time I ever saw August in the neighborhood, at least that I remember. But I've seen him around ever since then: a couple of times in the playground, a few times in the park. He used to wear an astronaut helmet sometimes. But I always knew it was him underneath the helmet. All the kids in the neighborhood knew it was him. Everyone has seen August at some point or another. We all know his name, though he doesn't know ours.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那是我第一次在附近看到奥古斯特，起码我还记得。不过那以后我也在附近见过他：几次在操场，几次在公园。曾经有段时间他常常戴着一顶宇航员头盔。附近所有的孩子都知道那是他。每个人都多多少少见过他。我们都知道他叫什么名字，不过他并不认识我们。">查看中文翻译</div>
