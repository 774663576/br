<div class="line_en">Noel and Lorraine were in and out of each other's houses. They shared a weakness for Chinese food and often went out for lunch while the children were in school. Elizabeth and her brother attended the Fuisz children's birthday parties and frolicked in the Fuiszes' pool.

<div class="line_en">The relationship between their husbands wasn't as warm. While Chris Holmes had to make do on a government salary, Richard Fuisz was a successful businessman and wasn't shy about flaunting it. A licensed doctor, he had sold a company that made medical-training films for more than $50 million a few years earlier and drove a Porsche and a Ferrari. He was also a medical inventor who licensed out his patents and reaped the royalties. During one excursion the families made together to the zoo, Justin Fuisz remembers, Elizabeth's younger brother, Christian, told him, "My dad thinks your dad is an asshole." When Justin later repeated the comment to his mother, Lorraine chalked it up to jealousy.</div>

<div class="line_en">Whatever simmering resentments Chris Holmes harbored did not prevent Noel Holmes and Lorraine Fuisz from being good friends. The two women stayed in regular contact even after the Holmeses moved away, first to California and then to Texas. When the Holmeses returned to Washington for a brief period in between, the Fuiszes took them out to a nice restaurant to celebrate Noel's fortieth birthday. Lorraine arranged the outing to make up for the fact that Chris hadn't thrown his wife a party.</div>

<div class="line_en">In 2001, Chris Holmes hit a rough patch in his career. He had left Tenneco to take a position at Enron, Houston's most prominent corporation. When Enron's fraudulent practices were exposed and it went bankrupt in December of that year, he lost his job like thousands of other employees. In the aftermath, he paid a visit to Richard Fuisz in search of job leads and business advice. With one of his sons from a previous marriage, Fuisz had started a new company around one of his inventions: a thin strip that dissolved in the mouth and delivered drugs to the bloodstream faster than traditional pills. He and his son, Joe, ran it from a suite of offices in Great Falls, Virginia.</div>

<div class="line_en">Chris Holmes came in looking haggard and glum, Joe Fuisz recalls. He mused aloud about trying his hand at consulting and indicated that he and Noel were desperate to move back to Washington. Having just purchased a new house in the affluent Beltway suburb of McLean, Richard Fuisz offered him use of the one he and Lorraine had just vacated across the street, rent-free.

<div class="line_en">CHRIS AND NOEL HOLMES DID eventually move back to Washington four years later when Chris got a job at the World Wildlife Fund.

<div class="line_en">Over lunch one day, the topic turned to Elizabeth and what she was up to. Noel proudly told Lorraine that her daughter had invented a wrist device that could analyze a person's blood and started a company to commercialize it. The reality was that Theranos was already moving on from Elizabeth's original patch idea at that point, but that lost nuance hardly mattered in the chain of events Noel's lunchtime confidence unleashed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一天两人共进午餐，话题聊到伊莉莎白以及她正在做的事。诺儿得意地告诉萝芮，她的女儿发明了一种戴在手腕的设备，可以分析血液，还成立公司要将产品商品化。其实，当时Theranos已经舍弃伊莉莎白最初的贴片点子，不过比起诺儿透露的一连串大事，细节稍微有误无伤大雅。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Richard Fuisz was a vain and prideful man. The thought that the daughter of longtime friends and former neighbors would launch a company in his area of expertise and that they wouldn't ask for his help or even consult him deeply offended him. As he would put it years later in an email, "The fact that the Holmes family was so willing to partake of our hospitality (New York apartment, dinners, etc.) made it particularly bitter to me that they would not ask for advice. Essentially the message was, 'I'll drink your wine but I won't ask you for advice in the very field that paid for the wine.' "</div>

<div class="line_en">Fuisz had a history of taking slights personally and bearing grudges. The lengths he was willing to go to get even with people he perceived to have crossed him is best illustrated by his long and protracted feud with Vernon Loucks, the CEO of hospital supplies maker Baxter International.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="傅伊兹曾有一段对他人的轻视耿耿于怀甚至怀恨在心的历史。不管时间过了多久，他都要向惹到他的人报一箭之仇，最好的例子就是他跟韦能．洛克斯（Vernon Loucks）——百特医疗用品制造商（Baxter International）首席执行官——一段歹戏拖棚的长久宿怨。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Fuisz was supposed to stay on to head the new Baxter subsidiary for three years, but Loucks dismissed him shortly after the acquisition closed. Fuisz sued Baxter for wrongful termination, alleging that Loucks had fired him for refusing to pay a $2.2 million bribe to a Saudi firm to get Baxter off an Arab blacklist of companies that did business with Israel.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="原本说好，纳入百特旗下后傅伊兹继续留任三年，但洛克斯在收购完成后就解雇他，于是傅伊兹上法院控告百特非法解雇。他宣称，洛克斯之所以解雇他，是因为他不愿以二百二十万美元贿赂沙特阿拉伯一家公司，好让百特从阿拉伯的黑名单（因为与以色列有生意往来而上榜）除名。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, Fuisz traveled a lot to the Middle East, which had become the biggest market for Medcom, his medical film business. On his way back, he usually spent a night in Paris or London and from there took the Concorde, the supersonic passenger jet operated by British Airways and Air France, back to New York. During one of these stopovers in 1982, he ran into Loucks at the Plaza Athénée hotel in Paris. At the time, Baxter was eager to expand into the Middle East. Over dinner, Loucks offered to buy Medcom for $53 million and Fuisz accepted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从一九七〇年代到一九八〇年代初，傅伊兹常去中东，那里是他的医疗教育影片公司梅德康（Medcom）最大的市场。回程时，他通常会在巴黎或伦敦停留一晚，再从那里搭协和客机（英国航空和法国航空联营的超音速客机）回纽约。一九八二年有一次，他在巴黎雅典娜广场饭店（Plaza Athénée Hotel）偶遇洛克斯，当时百特公司急于打入中东市场。共进晚餐时，洛克斯提出以五千三百万美元收购梅德康的意愿，傅伊兹接受了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Fuisz's work for the CIA involved setting up dummy corporations throughout the Middle East that employed agency assets, giving them a non-embassy cover to operate outside the scrutiny of local intelligence services. One of the companies supplied oil-rig operators to the national oil company of Syria, where he was particularly well connected.</div>

<div class="line_en">In 1989, Baxter was taken off the Arab boycott list, giving Fuisz an opening to seek his revenge. He was leading a double life as an undercover CIA agent by then, having volunteered his services to the agency a few years earlier after coming across one of its ads in the classified pages of the Washington Post.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一九八九年，百特从阿拉伯杯葛的企业名单中除名，这给了傅伊兹一个报仇的机会。当时傅伊兹过着两面生活，不为人知的那面是中情局卧底探员，几年前他在《华盛顿邮报》（The Washington Post）看到中情局招募广告，自愿加入。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The two sides reached a settlement in 1986, under which Baxter agreed to pay Fuisz $800,000. That wasn't the end of it, however. When Fuisz flew to Baxter's Deerfield, Illinois, headquarters to sign the settlement, Loucks refused to shake his hand, angering Fuisz and putting him back on the warpath.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="双方在一九八六年达成和解，百特同意给傅伊兹八十万美元，不过事情并没有就此结束。傅伊兹飞到百特位于伊利诺州迪尔菲尔德（Deerfield）总部签署和解书时，洛克斯不愿与他握手，此举激怒了傅伊兹，他准备再次反击。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Fuisz suspected Baxter had gotten itself back in Arab countries' good graces through chicanery and set out to prove it using his Syrian connections. He sent a female operative he'd recruited to obtain a memorandum kept on file in the offices of the Arab League committee in Damascus that was in charge of enforcing the boycott. It showed that Baxter had provided the committee detailed documentation about its recent sale of an Israeli plant and promised it wouldn't make new investments in Israel or sell the country new technologies. This put Baxter in violation of a U. S. anti-boycott law, enacted in 1977, that forbade American companies from participating in any foreign boycott or supplying blacklist officials any information that demonstrated cooperation with the boycott.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="傅伊兹猜想，百特必定是以诡计欺骗才重获阿拉伯国家喜爱，于是决定动用叙利亚的人脉来拆穿。他派出他招募的女性情报员取得一份备忘录，备忘录存盘于阿拉伯国家联盟委员会（负责运行杯葛的单位）位于大马士革的办公室。上面写着，百特已提供详细的文档给该委员会，证明百特已于最近售出以色列工厂，并承诺不会在以色列进行新投资，也不会卖新技术给以色列。百特此举违反了美国的反杯葛法，反杯葛法制订于一九七七年，明文禁止美国公司参与任何外国杯葛行动，也不可向黑名单上的官员提供任何证明配合杯葛行动的数据。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As much as he was annoyed by what he perceived as the Holmeses' ingratitude, Fuisz was also an opportunist. He made his money patenting inventions he anticipated other companies would someday want. One of his most lucrative plays involved repurposing a cotton candy spinner to turn drugs into fast-dissolving capsules. The idea came to him when he took his daughter to a country fair in Pennsylvania in the early 1990s.

Patent and Trademark Office on April 24, 2006. The proposed patent didn't purport to invent groundbreaking new technology. Rather, it combined existing ones -- wireless data transmission, computer chips, and bar codes -- into a physician alert mechanism that could be embedded in at-home blood-testing devices made by other companies.

<div class="line_en">That seemed far-fetched to Chuck. It was the sort of thing that would get an attorney fired and disbarred. John was a patent litigator. He wasn't part of McDermott's separate patent prosecution team that drafted and filed patents. He had no reason or justification for accessing Theranos's file. Besides, he was a partner at the firm. Why would he commit career suicide? It didn't make sense. What's more, Theranos had moved all its patent work to the Silicon Valley law firm Wilson Sonsini two years earlier, in 2006.

<div class="line_en">Chuck was hesitant to do that, though. He told Elizabeth he would have to think about it and talk to some of his colleagues. Fuisz had a son who was a partner at the firm, which made the situation awkward, he said. Elizabeth didn't blink at the mention of John Fuisz. It was the opening she was waiting for. She asked whether it was possible that John had accessed confidential information from McDermott's Theranos file and leaked it to his father.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是恰克对此有所迟疑。他告诉伊莉莎白他得考虑一下，还得跟几个同事谈谈，同时提及傅伊兹有个儿子在这里工作，情况很尴尬。听到恰克提起约翰．傅伊兹，伊莉莎白没有放过，她等很久了，立刻开口问，有没有可能是约翰取得McDermott内部的Theranos机密文件，泄露给他父亲。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Elizabeth got straight to the point. She wanted to know if McDermott would agree to represent Theranos against Richard Fuisz.

The winner's application gets priority even if it was filed later. Ken specialized in these types of cases.</div>
