<div class="line_en">"Harriet, poor Harriet!" -- Those were the words; in them lay the tormenting ideas which Emma could not get rid of, and which constituted the real misery of the business to her. Frank Churchill had behaved very ill by herself-very ill in many ways, -- but it was not so much his behaviour as her own, which made her so angry with him. It was the scrape which he had drawn her into on Harriet's account, that gave the deepest hue to his offence. -- Poor Harriet! to be a second time the dupe of her misconceptions and flattery. Mr. Knightley had spoken prophetically, when he once said, "Emma, you have been no friend to Harriet Smith." -- She was afraid she had done her nothing but disservice. -- It was true that she had not to charge herself, in this instance as in the former, with being the sole and original author of the mischief; with having suggested such feelings as might otherwise never have entered Harriet's imagination; for Harriet had acknowledged her admiration and preference of Frank Churchill before she had ever given her a hint on the subject; but she felt completely guilty of having encouraged what she might have repressed. She might have prevented the indulgence and increase of such sentiments. Her influence would have been enough. And now she was very conscious that she ought to have prevented them. -- She felt that she had been risking her friend's happiness on most insufficient grounds. Common sense would have directed her to tell Harriet, that she must not allow herself to think of him, and that there were five hundred chances to one against his ever caring for her. --"But, with common sense," she added, "I am afraid I have had little to do."</div>

<div class="line_en">She was extremely angry with herself. If she could not have been angry with Frank Churchill too, it would have been dreadful. -- As for Jane Fairfax, she might at least relieve her feelings from any present solicitude on her account. Harriet would be anxiety enough; she need no longer be unhappy about Jane, whose troubles and whose ill-health having, of course, the same origin, must be equally under cure. -- Her days of insignificance and evil were over. -- She would soon be well, and happy, and prosperous. -- Emma could now imagine why her own attentions had been slighted. This discovery laid many smaller matters open. No doubt it had been from jealousy. -- In Jane's eyes she had been a rival; and well might any thing she could offer of assistance or regard be repulsed. An airing in the Hartfield carriage would have been the rack, and arrowroot from the Hartfield storeroom must have been poison. She understood it all; and as far as her mind could disengage itself from the injustice and selfishness of angry feelings, she acknowledged that Jane Fairfax would have neither elevation nor happiness beyond her desert. But poor Harriet was such an engrossing charge! There was little sympathy to be spared for any body else. Emma was sadly fearful that this second disappointment would be more severe than the first. Considering the very superior claims of the object, it ought; and judging by its apparently stronger effect on Harriet's mind, producing reserve and self-command, it would. -- She must communicate the painful truth, however, and as soon as possible. An injunction of secresy had been among Mr. Weston's parting words. "For the present, the whole affair was to be completely a secret. Mr. Churchill had made a point of it, as a token of respect to the wife he had so very recently lost; and every body admitted it to be no more than due decorum." -- Emma had promised; but still Harriet must be excepted. It was her superior duty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她非常气自己。如果她不能也生弗兰克·邱吉尔的气，那就太可怕r。至于简·费尔法克斯，她至少现在用不着为她操心了。哈丽特已经够她心烦的了，她不必再为简苦恼，她那由于同一原因产生的烦恼和疾病，一定也会同样好起来。她那卑微不幸的日子已经到头了，她马上就会恢复健康，获得幸福，祥和如意。爱玛现在想象得出，为什么她的关心屡屡受到轻慢。这一发现使许多小事都容易理解了。无疑，那是出于嫉妒。在简看来，爱玛是她的情敌，她只要提出想帮助她、关心她，势必都要遭到拒绝。乘哈特菲尔德的马车出去兜风，等于叫她受刑；吃哈特菲尔德储藏室里的葛粉，岂不是叫她服毒。爱玛一切都明白了。她尽量摆脱掉气恼时的褊狭、自私心理，承认简·费尔法克斯攀得这样的人家，取得这样的幸福，都是她理所应得的。但是，她始终念念不忘她对可怜的哈丽特应负的责任！她顾不上再去同情别人了。爱玛非常伤心，担心这第二次打击比第一次来得还要沉重。考虑到对方的条件那么优越，必然会更加沉重；再看看此事在哈丽特心里显然产生了更强烈的影响，导致了她的沉闷不语和自我克制，那也会更加沉重。然而，她必须把这令人痛苦的事实告诉哈丽特，而且要尽快告诉。韦斯顿先生临别时叮嘱要保守秘密。“眼下，这件事还得严守秘密。邱吉尔先生特别强调这一点，借以表示他对他最近过世的妻子的敬重。人人都觉得这不过是尽尽礼仪而已。”爱玛答应了，但是哈丽特应当除外，她有义不容辞的责任。">查看中文翻译</div>

The intelligence, which had been so anxiously announced to her, she was now to be anxiously announcing to another. Her heart beat quick on hearing Harriet's footstep and voice; so, she supposed, had poor Mrs. Weston felt when she was approaching Randalls. Could the event of the disclosure bear an equal resemblance! -- But of that, unfortunately, there could be no chance.</div>

Some portion of respect for herself, however, in spite of all these demerits -- some concern for her own appearance, and a strong sense of justice by Harriet --(there would be no need of compassion to the girl who believed herself loved by Mr. Knightley-but justice required that she should not be made unhappy by any coldness now,) gave Emma the resolution to sit and endure farther with calmness, with even apparent kindness. -- For her own advantage indeed, it was fit that the utmost extent of Harriet's hopes should be enquired into; and Harriet had done nothing to forfeit the regard and interest which had been so voluntarily formed and maintained-or to deserve to be slighted by the person, whose counsels had never led her right. -- Rousing from reflection, therefore, and subduing her emotion, she turned to Harriet again, and, in a more inviting accent, renewed the conversation; for as to the subject which had first introduced it, the wonderful story of Jane Fairfax, that was quite sunk and lost. -- Neither of them thought but of Mr. Knightley and themselves.</div>

<div class="line_en">Harriet had been conscious of a difference in his behaviour ever since those two decisive dances. -- Emma knew that he had, on that occasion, found her much superior to his expectation. From that evening, or at least from the time of Miss Woodhouse's encouraging her to think of him, Harriet had begun to be sensible of his talking to her much more than he had been used to do, and of his having indeed quite a different manner towards her; a manner of kindness and sweetness! -- Latterly she had been more and more aware of it. When they had been all walking together, he had so often come and walked by her, and talked so very delightfully! -- He seemed to want to be acquainted with her. Emma knew it to have been very much the case. She had often observed the change, to almost the same extent. -- Harriet repeated expressions of approbation and praise from him -- and Emma felt them to be in the closest agreement with what she had known of his opinion of Harriet. He praised her for being without art or affectation, for having simple, honest, generous, feelings. -- She knew that he saw such recommendations in Harriet; he had dwelt on them to her more than once. -- Much that lived in Harriet's memory, many little particulars of the notice she had received from him, a look, a speech, a removal from one chair to another, a compliment implied, a preference inferred, had been unnoticed, because unsuspected, by Emma. Circumstances that might swell to half an hour's relation, and contained multiplied proofs to her who had seen them, had passed undiscerned by her who now heard them; but the two latest occurrences to be mentioned, the two of strongest promise to Harriet, were not without some degree of witness from Emma herself. -- The first, was his walking with her apart from the others, in the lime-walk at Donwell, where they had been walking some time before Emma came, and he had taken pains (as she was convinced) to draw her from the rest to himself-and at first, he had talked to her in a more particular way than he had ever done before, in a very particular way indeed! --(Harriet could not recall it without a blush.) He seemed to be almost asking her, whether her affections were engaged. -- But as soon as she (Miss Woodhouse) appeared likely to join them, he changed the subject, and began talking about farming: -- The second, was his having sat talking with her nearly half an hour before Emma came back from her visit, the very last morning of his being at Hartfield-though, when he first came in, he had said that he could not stay five minutes-and his having told her, during their conversation, that though he must go to London, it was very much against his inclination that he left home at all, which was much more (as Emma felt) than he had acknowledged to her. The superior degree of confidence towards Harriet, which this one article marked, gave her severe pain.</div>
