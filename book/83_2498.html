<div class="line_en">We went out at the French doors and along a smooth red-flagged path that skirted the far side of the lawn from the garage. The boyish-looking chauffeur had a big black and chromium sedan out now and was dusting that. The path took us along to the side of the greenhouse and the butler opened a door for me and stood aside. It opened into a sort of vestibule that was about as warm as a slow oven. He came in after me, shut the outer door, opened an inner door and we went through that. Then it was really hot. The air was thick, wet, steamy and larded with the cloying smell of tropical orchids in bloom. The glass walls and roof were heavily misted and big drops of moisture splashed down on the plants. The light had an unreal greenish color, like light filtered through an aquarium tank. The plants filled the place, a forest of them, with nasty meaty leaves and stalks like the newly washed fingers of dead men. They smelled as overpowering as boiling alcohol under a blanket.</div>

<div class="line_en">The butler did his best to get me through without being smacked in the face by the sodden leaves, and after a while we came to a clearing in the middle of the jungle, under the domed roof. Here, in a space of hexagonal flags, an old red Turkish rug was laid down and on the rug was a wheel chair, and in the wheel chair an old and obviously dying man watched us come with black eyes from which all fire had died long ago, but which still had the coal-black directness of the eyes in the portrait that hung above the mantel in the hall. The rest of his face was a leaden mask, with the bloodless lips and the sharp nose and the sunken temples and the outward-turning earlobes of approaching dissolution. His long narrow body was wrapped -- in that heat -- in a traveling rug and a faded red bathrobe. His thin clawlike hands were folded loosely on the rug, purple-nailed. A few locks of dry white hair clung to his scalp, like wild flowers fighting for life on a bare rock.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="管家带我穿行其间，尽他所能帮我避开那些要打到人脸上的湿叶子。片刻之后，我们来到了植丛中央的一块空地，头上便是圆顶。眼前，在六面旗帜围成的六边形区域中，铺着一块陈旧的红色土耳其地毯，地毯上是一部轮椅，轮椅上有个行将就木的垂垂老者，他看着我们，那双黑眼睛早已黯淡无光，却依然如炉台上方画中人的眼眸那样墨黑，那样率直。他脸的其余部分简直是一张铅制面具：毫无血色的嘴唇，尖鼻子，凹陷的太阳穴和渐渐腐烂、外翘的耳垂。包裹他细长身体的——在这样的高温下——是一条旅行毯和一件褪色的红浴袍。他的手鸟爪一般瘦骨嶙峋，松弛地交叠在毯子上，指甲呈紫色。几绺干枯的白发死死扎根于他的头皮，好比野花在不毛的岩石上奋力求生。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The old man didn't move or speak, or even nod. He just looked at me lifelessly. The butler pushed a damp wicker chair against the backs of my legs and I sat down. He took my hat with a deft scoop.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那老者没动也没说话，连头都没点一下。他只是了无生气地看着我。管家把一张湿漉漉的藤椅推到我的腿肚子边，我坐了下去。他娴熟地一抄手，拿走了我的帽子。">查看中文翻译</div>

I sat down again and I felt automatically for a cigarette and then stopped. The old man caught the gesture and smiled faintly.</div>

<div class="line_en">"A nice state of affairs when a man has to indulge his vices by proxy," he said dryly. "You are looking at a very dull survival of a rather gaudy life, a cripple paralyzed in both legs and with only half of his lower belly. There's very little that I can eat and my sleep is so close to waking that it is hardly worth the name. I seem to exist largely on heat, like a newborn spider, and the orchids are an excuse for the heat. Do you like orchids?"</div>

<div class="line_en">I stared at him with my mouth open. The soft wet heat was like a pall around us. The old man nodded, as if his neck was afraid of the weight of his head. Then the butler came pushing back through the jungle with a teawagon, mixed me a brandy and soda, swathed the copper ice bucket with a damp napkin, and went away softly among the orchids. A door opened and shut behind the jungle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我张嘴注视着他。温和潮湿的热气像棺罩一样包围着我俩。老者点点头，他的脖子好似生怕承受不住脑袋的重量。管家推着一辆茶具车拨开植丛回来了，他给我调了一杯苏打白兰地，用一块湿毛巾裹好铜冰桶，徐徐钻进兰花丛，走了。植丛后面，门开了又关上了。">查看中文翻译</div>

I worked for Mr. Wilde, the District Attorney, as an investigator once. His chief investigator, a man named Bernie Ohls, called me and told me you wanted to see me. I'm unmarried because I don't like policemen's wives."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“当然，不过没啥可说的。我三十三岁，上过大学，有需要的时候，也可以拽两句文。在我这行里，这种时候不是很多。我以前在地方检察官王尔德先生手下做探员。他的探长，一个名叫伯尼·奥尔斯的人打电话来说您想见我。我未婚，因为不喜欢警察的老婆。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"He was the breath of life to me -- while he lasted. He spent hours with me, sweating like a pig, drinking brandy by the quart and telling me stories of the Irish revolution. He had been an officer in the I. R. A. He wasn't even legally in the United States. It was a ridiculous marriage of course, and it probably didn't last a month, as a marriage. I'm telling you the family secrets, Mr. Marlowe."</div>

It was addressed to General Guy Sternwood, 3765 Alta Brea Crescent, West Hollywood, California. The address was in ink, in the slanted printing engineers use. The envelope was slit. I opened it up and took out a brown card and three slips of stiff paper. The card was of thin brown linen, printed in gold: "Mr. Arthur Gwynn Geiger." No address. Very small in the lower left-hand corner: "Rare Books and De Luxe Editions." I turned the card over. More of the slanted printing on the back.

<div class="line_en">"Somebody's counting on that. It's the easiest way to fool them. That or the police. Geiger can collect on these notes, unless you can show fraud. Instead of that he makes you a present of them and admits they are gambling debts, which gives you a defense, even if he had kept the notes. If he's a crook, he knows his onions, and if he's an honest man doing a little loan business on the side, he ought to have his money. Who was this Joe Brody you paid the five thousand dollars to?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“有些人就指着这点呢。捉弄你们这是最简单的办法。要么利用自尊心，要么靠警察。除非您能揭穿骗局，盖革完全可以用这些字据讨债。但他没有那么做，反而把字据寄赠给您，还承认这些是赌债；即便字据他还留着，这样也给了你辩护的机会。如果他是个恶人，他思路很清晰；如果他是个老实人，只是兼职做点贷款罢了，这笔钱应该归他。刚才说的那个让您付了五千块的乔·布罗迪是什么人？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I sipped my drink and nodded. The pulse in his lean gray throat throbbed visibly and yet so slowly that it was hardly a pulse at all. An old man two-thirds dead and still determined to believe he could take it.</div>
