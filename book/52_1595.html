<div class="line_en">I clasp the flask between my hands even though the warmth from the tea has long since leached into the frozen air. My muscles are clenched tight against the cold. If a pack of wild dogs were to appear at this moment, the odds of scaling a tree before they attacked are not in my favor. I should get up, move around, and work the stiffness from my limbs. But instead I sit, as motionless as the rock beneath me, while the dawn begins to lighten the woods. I can't fight the sun. I can only watch helplessly as it drags me into a day that I've been dreading for months.</div>

The reporters, the camera crews, even Effie Trinket, my old escort, will have made their way to District 12 from the Capitol. I wonder if Effie will still be wearing that silly pink wig, or if she'll be sporting some other unnatural color especially for the Victory Tour. There will be others waiting, too. A staff to cater to my every need on the long train trip. A prep team to beautify me for public appearances. My stylist and friend, Cinna, who designed the gorgeous outfits that first made the audience take notice of me in the Hunger Games.</div>

<div class="line_en">If it were up to me, I would try to forget the Hunger Games entirely. Never speak of them. Pretend they were nothing but a bad dream. But the Victory Tour makes that impossible. Strategically placed almost midway between the annual Games, it is the Capitol's way of keeping the horror fresh and immediate. Not only are we in the districts forced to remember the iron grip of the Capitol's power each year, we are forced to celebrate it. And this year, I am one of the stars of the show. I will have to travel from district to district, to stand before the cheering crowds who secretly loathe me, to look down into the faces of the families whose children I have killed…</div>

<div class="line_en">The sun persists in rising, so I make myself stand. All my joints complain and my left leg has been asleep for so long that it takes several minutes of pacing to bring the feeling back into it. I've been in the woods three hours, but as I've made no real attempt at hunting, I have nothing to show for it. It doesn't matter for my mother and little sister, Prim, anymore. They can afford to buy butcher meat in town, although none of us likes it any better than fresh game. But my best friend, Gale Hawthorne, and his family will be depending on today's haul and I can't let them down. I start the hour-and-a-half trek it will take to cover our snare line. Back when we were in school, we had time in the afternoons to check the line and hunt and gather and still get back to trade in town. But now that Gale has gone to work in the coal mines -- and I have nothing to do all day -- I've taken over the job.</div>

<div class="line_en">By this time Gale will have clocked in at the mines, taken the stomach-churning elevator ride into the depths of the earth, and be pounding away at a coal seam. I know what it's like down there. Every year in school, as part of our training, my class had to tour the mines. When I was little, it was just unpleasant. The claustrophobic tunnels, foul air, suffocating darkness on all sides. But after my father and several other miners were killed in an explosion, I could barely force myself onto the elevator. The annual trip became an enormous source of anxiety. Twice I made myself so sick in anticipation of it that my mother kept me home because she thought I had contracted the flu.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这会儿盖尔肯定正在井下熬点呢，他得先坐上颠得让人想吐的罐车，下到深不见底的井下，然后在掌子面上挖煤。我知道在井下是什么感觉。在学校时，作为基本训练，我们班每年都到井下去体验生活。我小时候真不愿意去，那狭窄幽闭的巷道、污浊的空气、四下里一片漆黑，可真够人受的。自从爸爸和另外几个矿工在爆炸中身亡之后，我连逼迫自己上罐车都很难，每年去井下参观成了我的一大心事，有两次我为这事都病倒了，妈妈还以为我得了流感。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I think of Gale, who is only really alive in the woods, with its fresh air and sunlight and clean, flowing water. I don't know how he stands it. Well… yes, I do. He stands it because it's the way to feed his mother and two younger brothers and sister. And here I am with buckets of money, far more than enough to feed both our families now, and he won't take a single coin. It's even hard for him to let me bring in meat, although he'd surely have kept my mother and Prim supplied if I'd been killed in the Games. I tell him he's doing me a favor, that it drives me nuts to sit around all day. Even so, I never drop off the game while he's at home. Which is easy since he works twelve hours a day.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="盖尔只有在林子里时才能真正地快活起来，这里有新鲜的空气、明媚的阳光，汩汩流淌的清澈溪水。我真不知道他是怎么忍受井下的一切的。哦…当然，他不得不忍受这一切，因为他要养活自己的妈妈、两个弟弟和妹妹。可我现在有足够的钱能养活我们两家人，但他一个铜子儿都不要，我想给他带点肉都难。说实话，要是我在饥饿游戏中死掉，他不一样会养活妈妈和波丽姆吗。我对他说，收下猎物等于帮我一个忙，我一天到晚闲着没事，会发疯的。可即使如此，只要他在家，就决不收我打的猎物。不过还好，他一天在矿上千十二个小时，给他家送去些猎物总还不算太难。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The only time I really get to see Gale now is on Sundays, when we meet up in the woods to hunt together. It's still the best day of the week, but it's not like it used to be before, when we could tell each other anything. The Games have spoiled even that. I keep hoping that as time passes we'll regain the ease between us, but part of me knows it's futile. There's no going back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最近这段时间，只有到了星期日才能见到盖尔，我们先在林子里碰头，然后一起去打猎。这仍然是一周里最好的时光，可我总觉得一切都跟从前不大一样了，以前我们无话不谈，可现在在一起却有些拘谨了，饥饿游戏甚至毁了我们之间的默契。我一直希望随着时间的推移，我们之间兴许能够回到从前那样。可我心里又隐隐觉得这是不大可能的，过去的时光已经一去不复返了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I get a good haul from the traps -- eight rabbits, two squirrels, and a beaver that swam into a wire contraption Gale designed himself. He's something of a whiz with snares, rigging them to bent saplings so they pull the kill out of the reach of predators, balancing logs on delicate stick triggers, weaving inescapable baskets to capture fish. As I go along, carefully resetting each snare, I know I can never quite replicate his eye for balance, his instinct for where the prey will cross the path. It's more than experience. It's a natural gift. Like the way I can shoot at an animal in almost complete darkness and still take it down with one arrow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这次下的套逮到了不少猎物，八只兔子、两只松鼠，还有一只河狸钻到盖尔最会编的那种套里。他是这方面的高手，他会把打好套的绳子拴在弯弯的小树枝上，逮到猎物时树枝就会弹起来，别的食肉动物也抓不到：他还把几根原木搭在小巧的捕兽夹子上，来作为伪装；他编的鱼筐，只要鱼钻进去就很难逃脱。我一边收猎物一边想，我永远都不可能有他那样的本事，也没他那种直觉，他总能很好地判断猎物要从哪儿经过。这不仅仅是经验的问题，而是一种天赋，正如我可以在漆黑的夜晚一箭射中猎物一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">By the time I make it back to the fence that surrounds District 12, the sun is well up. As always, I listen a moment, but there's no telltale hum of electrical current running through the chain link. There hardly ever is, even though the thing is supposed to be charged full-time. I wriggle through the opening at the bottom of the fence and come up in the Meadow, just a stone's throw from my home. My old home. We still get to keep it since officially it's the designated dwelling of my mother and sister. If I should drop dead right now, they would have to return to it. But at present, they're both happily installed in the new house in the Victor's Village, and I'm the only one who uses the squat little place where I was raised. To me, it's my real home.</div>

<div class="line_en">I go there now to switch my clothes. Exchange my father's old leather jacket for a fine wool coat that always seems too tight in the shoulders. Leave my soft, worn hunting boots for a pair of expensive machine-made shoes that my mother thinks are more appropriate for someone of my status. I've already stowed my bow and arrows in a hollow log in the woods. Although time is ticking away, I allow myself a few minutes to sit in the kitchen. It has an abandoned quality with no fire on the hearth, no cloth on the table. I mourn my old life here. We barely scraped by, but I knew where I fit in, I knew what my place was in the tightly interwoven fabric that was our life. I wish I could go back to it because, in retrospect, it seems so secure compared with now, when I am so rich and so famous and so hated by the authorities in the Capitol.</div>

I let him in, feed him a chunk of beaver fat, and even rub him between the ears for a bit.</div>

<div class="line_en">I like Hazelle. Respect her. The explosion that killed my father took out her husband as well, leaving her with three boys and a baby due any day. Less than a week after she gave birth, she was out hunting the streets for work. The mines weren't an option, what with a baby to look after, but she managed to get laundry from some of the merchants in town. At fourteen, Gale, the eldest of the kids, became the main supporter of the family. He was already signed up for tesserae, which entitled them to a meager supply of grain and oil in exchange for his entering his name extra times in the drawing to become a tribute. On top of that, even back then, he was a skilled trapper. But it wasn't enough to keep a family of five without Hazelle working her fingers to the bone on that washboard. In winter her hands got so red and cracked, they bled at the slightest provocation. Still would if it wasn't for a salve my mother concocted. But they are determined, Hazelle and Gale, that the other boys, twelve-year-old Rory and ten-year-old Vick, and the baby, four-year-old Posy, will never have to sign up for tesserae.</div>

<div class="line_en">The liquor isn't for my family. It's for Haymitch, who acted as mentor for Peeta and me in the Games. He's surly, violent, and drunk most of the time. But he did his job -- more than his job -- because for the first time in history, two tributes were allowed to win. So no matter who Haymitch is, I owe him, too. And that's for always. I'm getting the white liquor because a few weeks ago he ran out and there was none for sale and he had a withdrawal, shaking and screaming at terrifying things only he could see. He scared Prim to death and, frankly, it wasn't much fun for me to see him like that, either. Ever since then I've been sort of stockpiling the stuff just in case there's a shortage again.</div>

My feet shift through the garbage on the floor, and I unearth a tin coffeepot and fill it at the sink. The stove isn't completely out and I manage to coax the few live coals into a flame.
