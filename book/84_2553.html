<div class="line_en">Idaho isn't famous for many things, so I figured I'd have heard of whatever "Ruby Ridge" was. He'd said it was a conflict. I searched my memory, trying to recall if I'd ever heard the words. There was something familiar in them. Then images appeared in my mind, weak and distorted, as if the transmission were being disrupted at the source. I closed my eyes and the scene became vivid. I was in our house, crouching behind the birchwood cabinets. Mother was kneeling next to me, her breath slow and tired. She licked her lips and said she was thirsty, then before I could stop her she stood and reached for the tap. I felt the tremor of gunfire and heard myself shout. There was a thud as something heavy fell to the floor. I moved her arm aside and gathered up the baby.</div>

<div class="line_en">The name Randy Weaver was familiar, and even as I read it I heard it falling from my father's lips. Then the story as it had lived in my imagination for thirteen years began replaying in my mind: the shooting of a boy, then of his father, then of his mother. The Government had murdered the entire family, parents and children, to cover up what they had done.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰迪·韦弗这个名字很耳熟，读到它时，我听见这个名字从父亲的嘴边滑落。接着，这个在我的想象里存在了十三年的故事又开始在脑海中重演：一个男孩被枪杀，然后是他父亲，之后是他母亲。政府为了掩盖所作所为，杀害了他们全家，包括父母和孩子。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I scrolled past the backstory to the first shooting. Federal agents had surrounded the Weaver cabin. The mission was surveillance only, and the Weavers were unaware of the agents until a dog began to bark. Believing the dog had sensed a wild animal, Randy's fourteen-year-old son, Sammy, charged into the woods. The agents shot the dog, and Sammy, who was carrying a gun, opened fire. The resulting conflict left two dead: a federal agent and Sammy, who was retreating, running up the hill toward the cabin, when he was shot in the back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我略过背景故事，滚动到第一次开枪事件。联邦特工包围了韦弗家的小木屋。这次仅仅是监视任务，韦弗一家人并不知情，直到一条狗开始吠叫。兰迪十四岁的儿子萨米以为狗觉察到有野生动物出没，于是冲进了树林。特工们击中了狗，持枪的萨米开了火。由此引发的冲突造成一名联邦特工和萨米两人死亡。萨米当时正在撤退，朝山上的小木屋跑去，背部被子弹击中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I read on. The next day, Randy Weaver was shot, also in the back, while trying to visit his son's body. The corpse was in the shed, and Randy was lifting the latch on the door, when a sniper took aim at his spine and missed. His wife, Vicki, moved toward the door to help her husband and again the sniper opened fire. The bullet struck her in the head, killing her instantly as she held their ten-month-old daughter. For nine days the family huddled in the cabin with their mother's body, until finally negotiators ended the standoff and Randy Weaver was arrested.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我继续阅读。第二天，兰迪·韦弗试图去查看儿子的尸体，也被击中背部。尸体被放在棚子里，兰迪打开门闩时，一名狙击手瞄准了他的脊椎，但没打中。他的妻子薇姬朝门口走去帮助丈夫，狙击手再次开火。子弹击中了她的头部，她当场死亡，怀里还抱着十个月大的女儿。这一家人和母亲的尸体一起在小木屋里躲了九天，直到最后谈判代表结束了这场对峙，兰迪·韦弗被捕。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There was one thing I still didn't understand: Why had federal agents surrounded Randy Weaver's cabin in the first place? Why had Randy been targeted? I remembered Dad saying it could just as easy be us. Dad was always saying that one day the Government would come after folks who resisted its brainwashing, who didn't put their kids in school.

<div class="line_en">For one bitter moment, I thought Dad had lied. Then I remembered the fear on his face, the heavy rattling of his breath, and I felt certain that he'd really believed we were in danger. I reached for some explanation and strange words came to mind, words I'd learned only minutes before: paranoia, mania, delusions of grandeur and persecution. And finally the story made sense -- the one on the page, and the one that had lived in me through childhood. Dad must have read about Ruby Ridge or seen it on the news, and somehow as it passed through his feverish brain, it had ceased to be a story about someone else and had become a story about him. If the Government was after Randy Weaver, surely it must also be after Gene Westover, who'd been holding the front line in the war with the Illuminati for years. No longer content to read about the brave deeds of others, he had forged himself a helmet and mounted a nag.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有那么痛苦的一瞬，我认为爸爸说了谎，接着我想起他脸上的恐惧、沉重而急促的呼吸，我确信他真的相信我们身处危险之中。我努力寻求一些解释，几分钟前才学会的奇怪的词语浮现在我的脑海：偏执、狂躁、自我感觉良好、被害妄想。终于，网页上的故事和伴随我童年的故事都说得通了。爸爸一定是在哪里读过或者在新闻上看到过鲁比山事件，不知怎的，经他狂热的大脑一加工，它不再是别人的故事，而是演绎成了他自己的故事。如果政府追捕兰迪·韦弗，那么肯定也盯上了吉恩·韦斯特弗，因为他在与光明会的斗争中一直站在前线。他不再满足于阅读别人的英勇事迹，于是为自己锻造了一顶头盔，骑上了一匹老马。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I returned to the top of the page and read the whole entry again, but this time I didn't skip the backstory. According to all the sources, including Randy Weaver himself, the conflict had begun when Randy sold two sawed-off shotguns to an undercover agent he'd met at an Aryan Nations gathering. I read this sentence more than once, many times in fact. Then I understood: white supremacy was at the heart of this story, not homeschool. The government, it seemed, had never been in the habit of murdering people for not submitting their children to a public education. This seemed so obvious to me now, it was difficult to understand why I had ever believed anything else.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我返回页面顶部，重新阅读整个条目，但这次没有跳过背景故事。根据所有消息来源，包括兰迪·韦弗自己，冲突始于他将两支枪管锯短的霰弹枪卖给一个他在雅利安国民组织[14]集会上认识的卧底。这句话我读了不止一遍，事实上读了很多遍，才恍然大悟：原来该事件的根本原因是白人至上主义，而不是在家上学。政府似乎从来不会因为不让孩子接受公共教育而杀人。如今这道理对我来说太显而易见了，很难理解为什么我曾经还相信过别的东西。【注：[14]Aryan Nations，美国极右翼白人至上主义、反犹太主义的宗教组织，创立于二十世纪四十年代，有严重的种族歧视。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I visited Buck's Peak the weekend after I submitted my paper. I had been home for less than an hour when Dad and I got into an argument. He said I owed him for the car. He really only mentioned it but I became crazed, hysterical. For the first time in my life I shouted at my father -- not about the car, but about the Weavers. I was so suffocated by rage, my words didn't come out as words but as choking, sputtering sobs. Why are you like this? Why did you terrify us like that? Why did you fight so hard against made-up monsters, but do nothing about the monsters in your own house?</div>

<div class="line_en">In class I had been taught about neurotransmitters and their effect on brain chemistry; I understood that disease is not a choice. This knowledge might have made me sympathetic to my father, but it didn't. I felt only anger. We were the ones who'd paid for it, I thought. Mother. Luke. Shawn. We had been bruised and gashed and concussed, had our legs set on fire and our heads cut open. We had lived in a state of alert, a kind of constant terror, our brains flooding with cortisol because we knew that any of those things might happen at any moment. Because Dad always put faith before safety. Because he believed himself right, and he kept on believing himself right -- after the first car crash, after the second, after the bin, the fire, the pallet. And it was us who paid.</div>

<div class="line_en">At first Nick was amused that I wouldn't see a doctor, but as the illness progressed his amusement turned to worry, then confusion. I blew him off. "It's not that serious," I said. "I'd go if it were serious."</div>

<div class="line_en">I began to feel poorly toward the end of May. A week passed in which I could hardly drag myself to my job, an internship at a law firm. I slept from early evening until late morning, then yawned through the day. My throat began to ache and my voice dropped, roughening into a deep crackle, as if my vocal cords had turned to sandpaper.</div>

<div class="line_en">I started to say I wouldn't go, but then I saw his face. He looked as though he had a question but knew there was no point in asking it. The tense line of his mouth, the narrowing of his eyes. This is what distrust looks like, I thought.</div>

<div class="line_en">He left, but now I had another problem. I didn't know how to go to a doctor. I called a friend from class and asked if she'd drive me. She picked me up an hour later and I watched, perplexed, as she drove right past the hospital a few blocks from my apartment. She took me to a small building north of campus, which she called a "clinic." I tried to feign nonchalance, act as though I'd done this before, but as we crossed the parking lot I felt as though Mother were watching me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他走了，但我还有一个困惑。我不知道怎么看医生。我打电话给班上的一个朋友，问她是否愿意开车送我。一个小时后她来接我，我困惑不解地看着她开车经过离我公寓几个街区远的医院。她带我去了校园北边的一栋小房子，她称其为“诊所”。我试图装出若无其事的样子，表现得好像以前来过一样。但当我们穿过停车场时，我感觉母亲的目光在注视着我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I didn't know what to say to the receptionist. My friend attributed my silence to my throat and explained my symptoms. We were told to wait. Eventually a nurse led me to a small white room where she weighed me, took my blood pressure, and swabbed my tongue. Sore throats this severe were usually caused by strep bacteria or the mono virus, she said. They would know in a few days.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我不知道该对接诊的护士说什么。朋友以为我不说话是因为喉咙疼，于是替我解释了症状。我们被告知等候。最后，一位护士把我带到一间白色的小房间，给我称了体重，量了血压，用棉签擦了舌头。她说，严重的咽喉肿痛通常是由链球菌或单核细胞病毒引起的，几天后他们就会知道结果。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When the results came back, I drove to the clinic alone. A balding middle-aged doctor gave me the results. "Congratulations," he said. "You're positive for strep and mono. Only person I've seen in a month to get both."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Both?" I whispered. "How can I have both?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“两种都是？”我低声说，“我怎么会两种都感染呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Very, very bad luck," he said. "I can give you penicillin for the strep, but there's not much I can do for the mono. You'll have to wait it out. Still, once we've cleared out the strep, you should feel better."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“非常非常倒霉，”他说，“我可以给你开点青霉素治疗链球菌，但对于单核细胞病毒我无能为力。你得等它自己痊愈。不过，一旦我们消灭了链球菌，你应该会感觉好一些。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The doctor asked a nurse to bring some penicillin. "We should start you on the antibiotics right away," he said. I held the pills in my palm and was reminded of that afternoon when Charles had given me ibuprofen. I thought of Mother, and of the many times she'd told me that antibiotics poison the body, that they cause infertility and birth defects. That the spirit of the Lord cannot dwell in an unclean vessel, and that no vessel is clean when it forsakes God and relies on man. Or maybe Dad had said that last part.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="医生让护士拿来一些青霉素。“我们应该马上给你开抗生素。”他说。我手里拿着药片，想起那天下午查尔斯给我服用布洛芬的情景。我想起母亲，想起她多次告诉我，抗生素毒害身体，会导致不孕不育和婴儿先天缺陷。耶和华的精神不能住在不洁的身体里。凡离弃上帝，依赖人类，这样的身体必然是不洁的。也许最后那部分是爸爸说的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I swallowed the pills. Perhaps it was desperation because I felt so poorly, but I think the reason was more mundane: curiosity. There I was, in the heart of the Medical Establishment, and I wanted to see, at long last, what it was I had always been afraid of. Would my eyes bleed? My tongue fall out? Surely something awful would happen. I needed to know what.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我吞下了药片。也许是因为太难受让我感到绝望，但我猜更多是因为一个再平常不过的理由：好奇。就这样，我来到医疗机构内部，想看看最终我一直以来害怕的事情会不会发生。我的双眼会流血吗？我的舌头会掉下来吗？肯定会有可怕的事情发生。我需要知道是什么。">查看中文翻译</div>

I recognized the formulas -- the oils and tinctures were to fortify the liver and kidneys, and the clay was a foot soak to draw toxins.
