<div class="line_en">Mr Bennet had a comfortable income of two thousand a year, and a pleasant house in Longbourn. But, unfortunately for his daughters, after his death all his property would pass to a distant male relation. Mrs Bennet's father had been a lawyer, and had only left his daughter a small amount of money. She had a brother who owned shops in London, and she also had a sister, married to a Mr Philips. He had been her father's clerk, and now carried on his late employer's business.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr and Mrs Philips lived in Meryton, which was only a kilometre or so from the village of Longbourn. It was a most convenient distance for the Bennet girls, who were usually tempted there three or four times a week, to visit their aunt or a dressmaker who lived opposite. The youngest daughters, Kitty and Lydia, were particularly regular visitors. Their minds were more vacant than their sisters, and if no better entertainment was available, a walk to Meryton always provided some amusement, as well as interesting local news from their aunt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="菲力普斯夫妇住在麦里屯，离浪搏恩村只有大约一公里。这个距离对于班纳特家的几位姑娘来说再方便不过了，她们常常禁不住每周上那儿去三四次，去看姨妈或者住在对面专做女式服装的裁缝。最小的两位姑娘，吉蒂和丽迪亚，尤其常去。她们的精神比几个姐姐更空虚，如果没有更好的娱乐方式，到麦里屯走一走总是会给她们带来一些乐趣，她们还会从姨妈那里听到当地一些有趣的新闻。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">After listening to their praise of the officers one morning, Mr Bennet said coolly, "From what I can see, you must be two of the silliest girls in the country. I've suspected it for some time, but now I'm convinced."</div>

At home they could talk of nothing but officers and their handsome uniforms: even Mr Bingley's fortune now seemed hardly worth considering.</div>

I remember when I used to like a red coat myself, and indeed I still do. If a good-looking officer with five or six thousand a year wanted to marry one of my girls, I wouldn't turn him down.

As the carriage was not available, and she was not keen on riding, she decided to walk the five kilometres to Netherfield.

Elizabeth continued alone, crossing field after field and jumping impatiently over streams, in her anxiety to see her sister.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，伊丽莎白真正感到焦急，决心去看看姐姐。因为没有马车，她又不热心骑马，所以，她决定步行五公里到尼日斐去。吉蒂和丽迪亚一直把她送到麦里屯，在那里，她们去找一位军官的妻子。伊丽莎白接着就一个人走下去，穿过一片片田地，跨越一条条小溪，心情烦躁，急切地要见到姐姐。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When she arrived at Netherfield, with tired feet, muddy stockings and a face healthily pink with exercise, she was shown straight into the sitting-room. The two sisters, Miss Bingley and Mrs Hurst, could hardly believe that she had come so far alone and on foot in such bad weather, but they received her politely. Their brother, however, was more than polite: he was kind and considerate towards her. Mr Darcy said very little, hesitating between admiration of her healthy good looks and doubt whether she should have come such a distance alone. Mr Hurst said nothing at all, as he was thinking only of his breakfast.</div>

<div class="line_en">That evening Elizabeth went down to dinner, leaving Jane in bed in her room. She noticed the Bingley sisters' apparent concern for Jane change to indifference in a few moments, and knew she had been right to dislike them at first sight. Mr Bingley, indeed, was the only one of the group whose behaviour she was satisfied with. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his politeness towards herself most pleasing. But the others, she felt, treated her as an unwelcome guest. Miss Bingley was concentrating all her attention on Mr Darcy, and Mrs Hurst also joined in their conversation, while Mr Hurst was only interested in eating, drinking and playing cards.</div>

<div class="line_en">Elizabeth was glad to be taken almost immediately to her sister's room, where she found Jane delighted to see her, but very feverish and unwell. The doctor came, and after examining his patient, advised that she should stay in bed and take some medicine. Elizabeth stayed with her all day, looking after her, and the Bingley sisters also spent some time in the patient's room. However, in the afternoon, when it was time for Elizabeth to leave, Jane seemed so upset that Miss Bingley was obliged to invite Elizabeth to stay at Netherfield for the present, and a servant was sent to Longbourn to inform the Bennet family and bring back some clothes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伊丽莎白几乎马上被带到了姐姐的卧室，对此她很满意。在那里，她发现简见到她很愉快，可是发着高烧，情况很糟糕。医生来了，给病人检查过之后，建议她卧床休息，吃点药。伊丽莎白全天和她呆在一起，照料她，彬格莱姐妹俩也在病房里呆了一段时间。可是，到了下午，伊丽莎白该走的时候，简似乎感到十分焦躁不安，彬格莱小姐就不得不邀请伊丽莎白先呆在尼日斐并派一个仆人到浪搏恩通知班纳特家，再带回些衣服。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Kitty and Lydia made an equally had impression. They had been whispering together, when suddenly Lydia, who was an attractive, confident, well-grown girl of fifteen, pushed herself rudely forward. She begged Mr Bingley to hold a ball at Netherfield. With his usual politeness, Mr Bingley promised he would, but Elizabeth saw his sisters exchanging meaningful glances. She was quite glad when her mother and sisters left. She and Jane were to stay another night at Netherfield, to allow Jane to recover completely.</div>

<div class="line_en">That evening Elizabeth appeared again in the sitting-room. She could not avoid noticing how frequently Mr Darcy's eyes were fixed on her, but as she felt sure that so great a man could not possibly admire her, she assumed that when he looked at her, he was criticizing her in some way. This thought did not cause her any pain, as she liked him too little to care for his approval.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the conversations she had with him, she spoke in her usual slightly mocking manner, rather expecting to offend him, but was surprised by the quiet politeness of his replies. Darcy had never before been so charmed by any woman. He really believed that if she did not have such vulgar relations, he might be in danger of falling in love with her. Miss Bingley saw or suspected enough to be jealous, and her great anxiety for the recovery of her dear friend Jane was increased by her wish to get rid of Elizabeth.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="班纳特先生见到两个年长些的女儿回家来，自然十分高兴，因为她们不在时，他总觉得家里少了点儿什么。可是班纳特太太本希望她们多住些日子，看到她们这么早回来，心里相当失望。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Fortunately perhaps, for almost everyone at Netherfield, Elizabeth and her sister, who was now quite recovered, were returning home the next day. Only Mr Bingley showed real sorrow at this, and was concerned that Jane might not be fit enough to travel. Mr Darcy was quite relieved, and determined that no sign of admiration for Elizabeth should escape him now. Miss Bingley's politeness to Elizabeth, as well as her affection for Jane, increased rapidly as the moment of departure approached, and she was able to say goodbye to them with many warm expressions of friendliness and a promise to visit them very soon.</div>
