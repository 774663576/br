<div class="line_en">Harris told me about the maze as we were passing through Molesey lock. Our boat was the only one in the lock that day. Usually it is very busy. On Sundays, when the weather is fine, there are boats everywhere. Everybody comes down to the river. They wear brightly coloured clothes, and the river is full of colour -- yellow, and blue, and orange, and green, and white, and red and pink.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈里斯谈起在迷宫的事时，我们正驶过莫尔赛水闸。那天在水闸就我们一只船。通常那儿很拥挤。星期天或者天气好的话，那儿到处是船。人们都到河上来，穿着色彩艳丽的衣服，一片五光十色——黄的、蓝的、桔红、绿的、白的、红的、粉的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At Hampton Harris wanted to get out and have a look at the church there, but I refused to stop. I have never liked visiting churches, but Harris loves them. He said,'I've looked forward to visiting Hampton Church ever since we decided to make this trip. 'He added,'I only came on the trip because I thought we were going there!'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到了汉普顿，哈里斯想上岸去看看那里的教堂，可我拒绝停下来，我从来不喜欢瞻仰教堂，而哈里斯却为之心仪已久。他说：“咱们计划出游的时候我就一直盼着来看看汉普顿教堂。”他又说：“我之所以来就是因为我想我们要到这儿。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then Harris got angry with George. 'Why does George have to play around all day? Why has he left us with this big, heavy boat to tow up and down the river? Why couldn't George come and do some work? Why didn't he take a day's holiday and come down with us? The bank! Ha! What good is he at the bank?'He stopped for a moment and then he continued,'I never see him doing any work there. He sits behind a bit of glass all day, and he pretends to do something. What's the good of a man behind a bit of glass? I have to work. Why can't George work? What does he do at the bank? What good are banks, anyway? They take all your money, and then, when you write out a cheque, they send it back! They say you've spent all your money! What's the good of that? If George was here, we could go to see that church. Anyway, I don't believe he's at the bank. He's playing about somewhere, that's what he's doing. And we've got to do all the work!… I'm going to get out and have a drink!'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，哈里斯一下把怒气都转向乔治。“为什么他可以整天晃荡，把这只又笨又沉的船扔下让我们划？为什么乔治不能来干点活呢？为什么不能休一天假，和我们一起行动呢？那个银行！哈！他在那儿有什么好的？”停了一会儿，他又接着说：“我可从来没有见过他在银行里干什么正经事。整天坐在一小块玻璃窗后面，好像在干工作。一个男子汉在那样一块玻璃窗后能有什么出息？我得工作谋生，为什么乔治就不能呢？他在银行做什么？再说银行又有什么好？他们拿了你的钱，可是你开张支票取钱，他们却又给你退回来，说你的钱已经花光了。那都有什么用？要是乔治在这里，我们还能去看看教堂。我根本不相信他在银行里，他一定到什么地方找乐去了，这才象他干的事，把苦差使都丢给我们！……不行，我得上岸去喝一杯。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I reminded him about George. I said,'We've got to get the boat up to Shepperton by five o'clock to meet him. '</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我提醒他别忘了乔治。我告诉他：“咱们还要在五点钟前赶到谢泼顿和他会合呢。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">However, he said that he must drink something. He climbed onto the seat and he bent down to get the bottle out of the basket. It was at the bottom, and he had to bend down, lower and lower. At the same time, he was trying to steer the boat, and he pulled the wrong rope. The boat turned sharply and bumped into the bank of the river, and Harris fell into the basket. He stood there on his head, and he held on to the side of the boat. His legs were in the air. He could not move in case he fell over. He had to stay there until I could catch his legs and pull him back. And that made him more angry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可是他说非得喝点什么不可。他爬上座位，弯下腰在篮子里找瓶子。可瓶子在篮子底，他还得往下弯腰，越弯越低，与此同时又要掌舵，因此拉错了绳子。小船猛地打了个转，一下撞在岸上，哈里斯一头栽在篮子里，脑袋倒立着，双手撑在船边，两腿竖在空中。他一动不敢动，生怕翻到水里去。就这样倒立了半天。后来我抱住他的双腿，才把他拖了出来。可是他更加怒火中烧，暴跳如雷。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I reminded him that we had water in the boat. Then he started shouting about water. He said drinks like that made people ill.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我提醒他船上有水喝，他又骂起水来，说人喝了那样的水一定会生病。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We stopped under the trees by Kempton Park, and we had lunch. It is very pretty there, on the grass by the river, under the trees. We had an excellent meal, and Harris calmed down and began to enjoy himself again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们的船停在肯普顿公园附近的绿荫之下，就在那儿开始吃午餐。我们坐在河边的草地上，坐在树下，景致很美。午餐十分丰盛，哈里斯安静下来，心情也舒畅了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I told him that there were no pubs nearby, and then he started shouting about the river. 'What good is the river? We'll all die of thirst! No pubs!'(It's better to let Harris go on shouting when he gets angry. Then he gets tired, and he is quiet afterwards. )</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我告诉他附近没有小酒馆，他又转过来冲着河咆哮起来。“河有什么好？我们一样要渴死了，连小酒馆也没有。”（哈里斯生气的时候，最好的办法就是让他喊下去。过一会儿，喊累了，他也就安静了。）">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Next we came to Halliford and Shepperton. There is an old church at Shepperton, and I was worried in case Harris wanted to go and visit it. I saw him looking towards it as we came near, but I moved the boat quickly, and Harris's cap fell into the water. We had to get it back, of course. Luckily, he was very angry with me, and so he forgot about his church.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接下去我们到了哈利福德和谢泼顿。谢泼顿有一座古老的教堂，我真担心，怕哈里斯又要去参观。我看他一直呆呆地望着，就把船划得飞快，结果哈里斯的帽子掉进水里去了，我们又折回去。幸运的是，他光顾和我生气了，把教堂的事儿给丢在脑后。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As we came up to the lock at Weybridge, we saw something brightly coloured on one of the lock gates. When we looked closer, we saw that it was George. Montmorency started to bark madly. I shouted, and Harris called out wildly. George waved his cap and yelled back to us. The lock-keeper ran out because he thought someone had fallen in the water. He seemed annoyed when he saw that no one had fallen in.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="再往上走，到了韦布里奇水闸，我们一眼就看到一扇闸门上有个色彩鲜艳的东西在动，靠近仔细一看才发现是乔治。“元帅”汪汪乱叫着，我尖声叫喊着，哈里斯也手舞足蹈地大声吼着。乔治挥舞着帽子，冲我们打招呼。水闸管理员也跑了出来，还以为有人掉到水里了。可一看没事，他似乎颇为恼怒。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">By half past three, we had reached Sunbury lock. Then we went up to Walton, which is quite an interesting place. Julius Caesar stayed there with his soldiers. Queen Elizabeth I, she was there too. You can never get away from that woman. She was everywhere.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="三点半钟，我们到了森伯里水闸，接着又上行到沃尔顿。那是个很有趣的地方，凯撒曾和他的士兵在那里呆过，伊丽莎白一世也是常客。对了，你永远别想甩掉这位女士，她无所不在。">查看中文翻译</div>
