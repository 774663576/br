"How much theymust enjoy it! But" (with a little return of anxiety) "it cannot beexpected to last long. At this time of the year, and after such aseries of rain, we shall certainly have very little more of it. Frostswill soon set in, and in all probability with severity. In another dayor two perhaps; this extreme mildness can hardly last longer-nay, perhaps it may freeze tonight!"</div>

<div class="line_en">The Miss Dashwoods had no greater reason to be dissatisfied with Mrs. Jennings's style of living, and set of acquaintance, than with herbehaviour to themselves, which was invariably kind. Every thing in herhousehold arrangements was conducted on the most liberal plan, andexcepting a few old city friends, whom, to Lady Middleton's regret, shehad never dropped, she visited no one to whom an introduction could atall discompose the feelings of her young companions. Pleased to findherself more comfortably situated in that particular than she hadexpected, Elinor was very willing to compound for the want of much realenjoyment from any of their evening parties, which, whether at home orabroad, formed only for cards, could have little to amuse her.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mrs. Jennings soon appeared, and the note being given her, she read italoud. It was from Lady Middleton, announcing their arrival in ConduitStreet the night before, and requesting the company of her mother andcousins the following evening. Business on Sir John's part, and aviolent cold on her own, prevented their calling in Berkeley Street. The invitation was accepted; but when the hour of appointment drewnear, necessary as it was in common civility to Mrs. Jennings, thatthey should both attend her on such a visit, Elinor had some difficultyin persuading her sister to go, for still she had seen nothing ofWilloughby; and therefore was not more indisposed for amusement abroad, than unwilling to run the risk of his calling again in her absence.</div>

<div class="line_en">Elinor found, when the evening was over, that disposition is notmaterially altered by a change of abode, for although scarcely settledin town, Sir John had contrived to collect around him, nearly twentyyoung people, and to amuse them with a ball. This was an affair, however, of which Lady Middleton did not approve. In the country, anunpremeditated dance was very allowable; but in London, where thereputation of elegance was more important and less easily attained, itwas risking too much for the gratification of a few girls, to have itknown that Lady Middleton had given a small dance of eight or ninecouple, with two violins, and a mere side-board collation.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr. and Mrs. Palmer were of the party; from the former, whom they hadnot seen before since their arrival in town, as he was careful to avoidthe appearance of any attention to his mother-in-law, and thereforenever came near her, they received no mark of recognition on theirentrance. He looked at them slightly, without seeming to know who theywere, and merely nodded to Mrs. Jennings from the other side of theroom. Marianne gave one glance round the apartment as she entered: itwas enough-HE was not there-and she sat down, equally ill-disposed toreceive or communicate pleasure. After they had been assembled aboutan hour, Mr. Palmer sauntered towards the Miss Dashwoods to express hissurprise on seeing them in town, though Colonel Brandon had been firstinformed of their arrival at his house, and he had himself saidsomething very droll on hearing that they were to come.</div>

Marianne, who had seen him from thewindow, and who hated company of any kind, left the room before heentered it. He looked more than usually grave, and though expressingsatisfaction at finding Miss Dashwood alone, as if he had somewhat inparticular to tell her, sat for some time without saying a word. Elinor, persuaded that he had some communication to make in which hersister was concerned, impatiently expected its opening. It was not thefirst time of her feeling the same kind of conviction; for, more thanonce before, beginning with the observation of "your sister looksunwell to-day," or "your sister seems out of spirits," he had appearedon the point, either of disclosing, or of inquiring, somethingparticular about her. After a pause of several minutes, their silencewas broken, by his asking her in a voice of some agitation, when he wasto congratulate her on the acquisition of a brother? Elinor was notprepared for such a question, and having no answer ready, was obligedto adopt the simple and common expedient, of asking what he meant? Hetried to smile as he replied, "your sister's engagement to Mr. Willoughby is very generally known."</div>

Excuse me, Miss Dashwood. I believe I have been wrong insaying so much, but I hardly know what to do, and on your prudence Ihave the strongest dependence. Tell me that it is all absolutelyresolved on, that any attempt, that in short concealment, ifconcealment be possible, is all that remains."</div>

<div class="line_en">These words, which conveyed to Elinor a direct avowal of his love forher sister, affected her very much. She was not immediately able tosay anything, and even when her spirits were recovered, she debated fora short time, on the answer it would be most proper to give. The realstate of things between Willoughby and her sister was so little knownto herself, that in endeavouring to explain it, she might be as liableto say too much as too little. Yet as she was convinced thatMarianne's affection for Willoughby, could leave no hope of ColonelBrandon's success, whatever the event of that affection might be, andat the same time wished to shield her conduct from censure, she thoughtit most prudent and kind, after some consideration, to say more thanshe really knew or believed. She acknowledged, therefore, that thoughshe had never been informed by themselves of the terms on which theystood with each other, of their mutual affection she had no doubt, andof their correspondence she was not astonished to hear.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在埃丽诺听来，这一席话公开表白了他对她妹妹的眷恋，因而使她大为感动。她一下子说不出话，即使心情平静之后，心里还嘀咕了一阵，到底如何回答是好。威洛比和她妹妹之间的真实关系，她自己也是一无所知，勉强解释吧，可能不是说不到点子上，就是说过头。然而她又确信，玛丽安对威洛比的钟情无论结局如何，布兰登上校可能是没有希望成功的。在这同时，她还很想保护妹妹的行动不受指责，她经过再三考虑，觉得最明智、最宽厚的做法，还是不管她是否真的了解，真的信以为真，尽量多说点。因此她承认，虽然她从未听他们自己说过他们是什么关系，但是她对他们的相互钟爱并不怀疑，对他们相互通信并不感到惊讶。">查看中文翻译</div>
