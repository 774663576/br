<div class="line_en">After one look at it Puzzle gave a screaming bray and darted into the Tower. And Jill (who was no coward, as you know) hid her face in her hands to shut out the sight of it. The others watched it for perhaps a minute, until it streamed away into the thicker trees on their right and disappeared. Then the sun came out again, and the birds once more began to sing.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the shadow of the trees on the far side of the clearing something was moving. It was gliding very slowly Northward. At a first glance you might have mistaken it for smoke, for it was grey and you could see things through it. But the deathly smell was not the smell of smoke. Also, this thing kept its shape instead of billowing and curling as smoke would have done. It was roughly the shape of a man but it had the head of a bird; some bird of prey with a cruel, curved beak. It had four arms which it held high above its head, stretching them out Northward as if it wanted to snatch all Narnia in its grip; and its fingers -- all twenty of them -- were curved like its beak and had long, pointed, bird-like claws instead of nails. It floated on the grass instead of walking, and the grass seemed to wither beneath it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在开阔地远远的一边，树木的阴影里，有个东西在移动着。它正在慢慢地向北滑行。第一眼看到时，你会把它看做是烟霭，因为它是灰白色的，而且可以透过它看出去。但那种尸体的臭味并不是烟的臭味。那东西也保持着它的形体，不像烟那样起伏翻腾、蜷曲缭绕。它粗看是个人的形体，但长着一个鸟的头，乃是头上生着凶狠的钩形嘴的某种猛禽。它有四条手臂，高举在脑袋之上，朝北伸张开去，仿佛要把整个纳尼亚都抓在它的手掌里似的；而它的手指——总共有二十个手指——是像嘴巴一样弯弯的，尖端长的不是指甲，而是长长的尖尖的跟鸟一样的爪子。它不是在走路，而是在草上浮动，青草似乎在它身底下枯萎了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jewel had little to tell them. While he was a prisoner he had spent nearly all his time tied up at the back of the stable, and had of course heard none of the enemies' plans. He had been kicked (he'd done some kicking back too) and beaten and threatened with death unless he would say that he believed it was Aslan who was brought out and shown to them by firelight every night. In fact he was going to be executed this very morning if he had not been rescued. He didn't know what had happened to the Lamb.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="珍宝没有什么可告诉他们的。它是个俘虏时，几乎所有的时间都给绑在马厩背后，当然一点也没听到敌人的计划。它曾经被拳打脚踢（它也回踢了几脚），曾经受到处死的威胁，除非它愿意说它相信每天夜里带出去在火光中给它们看的，确实就是阿斯兰，否则就要宰了它。事实上，那天早晨就要执行死刑的，若不是蒂莲救了它的话。它不知道羊羔遭到的灾难。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The question they had to decide was whether they would go to Stable Hill again that night, show Puzzle to the Narnians and try to make them see how they had been tricked, or whether they should steal away Eastward to meet the help which Roonwit the Centaur was bringing up from Cair Paravel and return against the Ape and his Calormenes in force. Tirian would very much like to have followed the first plan: he hated the idea of leaving the Ape to bully his people one moment longer than need be. On the other hand, the way the Dwarfs had behaved last night was a warning. Apparently one couldn't be sure how people would take it even if he showed them Puzzle. And there were the Calormene soldiers to be reckoned with. Poggin thought there were about thirty of them. Tirian felt sure that if the Narnians all rallied to his side, he and Jewel and the children and Poggin (Puzzle didn't count for much) would have a good chance of beating them. But how if half the Narnians -- including all the Dwarfs -- just sat and looked on? or even fought against him? The risk was too great. And there was, too, the cloudy shape of Tash. What might it do?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们非作出决定不可的问题是：当夜他们要不要重上马厩山，把迷惑向纳尼亚国民示众，设法使他们明白他们被人欺骗了；或者，他们是否应该偷偷地向东而行，去与人头马龙威特从凯尔帕拉维尔带来的援军相会，然后一起回过头来大举进攻无尾猿和它的卡乐门士兵。蒂莲很想采取第一个方案：他一想到毫无必要地再听任无尾猿继续对纳尼亚国横行霸道下去，哪怕是短暂的片刻，他心里也恨得不得了。但在另一方面，昨天夜里小矮人们所表现出来的那种态度，倒是个警告。十分明显，如果拿迷惑来示众，大伙儿会采取什么态度，那是谁也吃不准的。还得对付卡乐门士兵哩。波金估计大约有三十个光景的卡乐门士兵。蒂莲觉得挺有把握，如果纳尼亚的群众都站在他的一边，他和独角兽，加上孩子们和小矮人波金（驴子迷惑可算不了什么）就会有大好机会打败敌人。但，如果一半纳尼亚群众——包括所有的小矮人们——只是坐在那儿冷眼旁观呢？或者甚至同他作战呢？这个风险可太大了。还有形体像云霾的塔什呢，它可能搞什么鬼把戏？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As soon as they had decided this, it was wonderful how much more cheerful everyone became. I don't honestly think that this was because any of them was afraid of a fight (except perhaps Jill and Eustace). But I daresay that each of them, deep down inside, was very glad not to go any nearer -- or not yet -- to that horrible bird-headed thing which, visible or invisible, was now probably haunting Stable Hill. Anyway, one always feels better when one has made up one's mind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们刚作出这个决定，说也奇怪，每个人都感到高兴得多了。说老实话，我并不认为那是因为他们之中有什么人害怕战斗（也许吉尔和尤斯塔斯是例外），但我敢大胆说一句，他们之中的每一位，内心里对于不再走近——或者说还没有走近——那长着鸟头的可怕的东西，是十分欣慰的。这东西，不论看得见或看不见，现在很可能正出没于马厩山上哩。无论如何，一个人下定了决心，总是感觉舒畅多了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the end they all agreed that the best thing was to go off and try to meet Roonwit.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="商量到末末了儿，大家一致同意，最好的策略就是离开这儿，设法同龙威特会师。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And then, as Poggin pointed out, there was no harm in leaving the Ape to deal with his own difficulties for a day or two. He would have no Puzzle to bring out and show now. It wasn't easy to see what story he -- or Ginger could make up to explain that. If the Beasts asked night after night to see Aslan, and no Aslan was brought out, surely even the simplest of them would get suspicious.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而且，正如波金所指出的，也不妨让无尾猿有那么一两天去对付它的困难。现在它没有驴子可拉出来示众了。看来无尾猿——或金格——要设法编造出故事来解释这个问题，可不容易哩。如果野兽们一夜复一夜地要求见到阿斯兰，而无尾猿却请不出阿斯兰来，那么，哪怕是头脑最简单的野兽，也会变得怀疑起来的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tirian said they had better remove their disguises, as they didn't want to be mistaken for Calormenes and perhaps attacked by any loyal Narnians they might meet. The Dwarf made up a horrid-looking mess of ashes from the hearth and grease out of the jar of grease which was kept for rubbing on swords and spear-heads. Then they took off their Calormene armour and went down to the stream. The nasty mixture made a lather just like soft soap: it was a pleasant, homely sight to see Tirian and the two children kneeling beside the water and scrubbing the backs of their necks or puffing and blowing as they splashed the lather off. Then they went back to the Tower with red, shiny faces, like people who have been given an extra good wash before a party. They re-armed themselves in true Narnian style, with straight swords and three-cornered shields. "Body of me," said Tirian. "That is better. I feel a true man again."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="蒂莲说，他们还是去掉伪装的好，因为他们不想被误认为是卡乐门人，也不想或许被可能遇到的忠诚的纳尼亚兽民所攻击。小矮人用壁炉里的灰和储备在润滑油瓶里的用以擦剑擦矛的油，制成了一种形状难看的糊糊。于是他们脱掉了卡乐门盔甲，到溪水里去洗刷。这肮脏的混合物变成一种泡沫糊糊，就像半液体皂一般。蒂莲和两个孩子跪在水边，擦着他们的脖子的后半部，用水泼掉泡沫糊糊时又喷又吹的，看上去真是一幅愉快的、家庭风味的图画。接着，他们就红光满面地回到堡垒里，就像人们去参加宴会之前，特别卖力地好好洗了一番一般。他们按照真正的纳尼亚方式，用笔直的剑和三个角的盾重新武装自己。“还我身体的本色，”蒂莲说道，“那就比较好了。我觉得我重新是个真正的人了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was a little after two in the afternoon when they set out, and it was the first really warm day of that spring. The young leaves seemed to be much further out than yesterday: the snow-drops were over, but they saw several primroses. The sunlight slanted through the trees, birds sang, and always (though usually out of sight) there was the noise of running water. It was hard to think of horrible things like Tash. The children felt, "This is really Narnia at last." Even Tirian's heart grew lighter as he walked ahead of them, humming an old Narnian marching song which had the refrain:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="下午两点钟稍微过一点儿，他们出发了，这是当年春天第一个真正暖和的日子，嫩叶似乎比昨天长出来好多了：雪花莲已经谢落，但他们看见了几朵报春花。阳光斜斜地穿过树木，众鸟鸣啭，总是有流水奔腾的声音（尽管往往看不见）。不会想到像塔什神之类的可怕事物了。孩子们感觉到：“终于领略到了真正的纳尼亚了。”甚至蒂莲的心也变得比较轻松，他走在大伙儿的前头，口中哼着一支古老的纳尼亚进行曲。曲子里有个叠句：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Puzzle begged very hard to have the lion-skin taken off him. He said it was too hot and the way it was rucked up on his back was uncomfortable: also, it made him look so silly.

<div class="line_en">After them came Puzzle, and after him Jill and Jewel walking very close together. Jill had, as you might say, quite fallen in love with the Unicorn. She thought- and she wasn't far wrong -- that he was the shiningest, delicatest, most graceful animal she had ever met: and he was so gentle and soft of speech that, if you hadn't known, you would hardly have believed how fierce and terrible he could be in battle.</div>

<div class="line_en">But the Unicorn explained to her that she was quite mistaken. He said that the Sons and Daughters of Adam and Eve were brought out of their own strange world into Narnia only at times when Narnia was stirred and upset, but she mustn't think it was always like that. In between their visits there were hundreds and thousands of years when peaceful King followed peaceful King till you could hardly remember their names or count their numbers, and there was really hardly anything to put into the History Books. And he went on to talk of old Queens and heroes whom she had never heard of. He spoke of Swanwhite the Queen who had lived before the days of the White Witch and the Great Winter, who was so beautiful that when she looked into any forest pool the reflection of her face shone out of the water like a star by night for a year and a day afterwards. He spoke of Moonwood the Hare who had such ears that he could sit by Caldron Pool under the thunder of the great waterfall and hear what men spoke in whispers at Cair Paravel. He told how King Gale, who was ninth in descent from Frank the first of all Kings, had sailed far away into the Eastern seas and delivered the Lone Islanders from a dragon and how, in return, they had given him the Lone Islands to be part of the royal lands of Narnia for ever. He talked of whole centuries in which all Narnia was so happy that notable dances and feasts, or at most tournaments, were the only things that could be remembered, and every day and week had been better than the last. And as he went on, the picture of all those happy years, all the thousands of them, piled up in Jill's mind till it was rather like looking down from a high hill on to a rich, lovely plain full of woods and waters and cornfields, which spread away and away till it got thin and misty from distance. And she said:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但独角兽给吉尔解释，说她完全搞错了。它说：只是在纳尼亚发生动乱或是被颠覆的时候，亚当和夏娃的子子孙孙才从他们自己的奇异世界里给送到纳尼亚来的，但她不能认为纳尼亚老是这样乱糟糟的。在他们的两次来访之间，隔着几百年乃至上千年的时光，当年和平的国王一个接着一个，简直没法儿记住国王的名字、点清国王的数目，历史书中也确实没有什么记载。它继续讲到她从未听说过的、老的女王们和英雄们。它讲起出生在白女巫和永恒严冬称王称霸时代之前的白天鹅女王，她长得那么美丽，她朝树林里随便哪一个池塘里瞧瞧，她的脸儿的倒影，便会从水里发出光辉，像黑夜里的明星一样，从此发光一年零一天。它讲起野兔蒙伍德长着一对神奇的耳朵，坐在大锅渊雷鸣般的大瀑布下，竟可以听到凯尔帕拉维尔人们的窃窃私语。它讲起弗兰克一世的第九代孙子、国王加尔，如何远航东海，从恶龙手里把孤独群岛解救出来，作为报答，人家又把孤独群岛献给他，永远划为纳尼亚国土的一部分。它讲到整整几个世纪里，纳尼亚全国是那么幸福，惟一能记得的事情，就只有著名的舞蹈和宴会，或者至多再加上比武大会了；而今天总比昨天好，这个星期总比上个星期好。独角兽继续讲下去时，所有这些幸福岁月的图画，成千上万张图画，都在吉尔的脑子里堆积起来了，终于仿佛是站在高山上俯瞰一大片富饶而美丽可爱的平原，平原上充满森林、河流和小麦田，连绵不断地往远处延伸，终于远得淡化了，模糊了。她说：">查看中文翻译</div>

"One was Cair Paravel filled with dead Narnians and living Calormenes: The Tisroc's banner advanced upon your royal battlements: and your subjects flying from the city -- this way and that, into the woods. Cair Paravel was taken from the sea. Twenty great ships of Calormen put in there in the dark of the night before last night."</div>
