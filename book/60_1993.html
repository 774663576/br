<div class="line_en">Life in the country was the only escape open to them, because only in the country was there a constant deficit of people and a surplus of living accommodations. No one bothered to look into the political past of people willing to go off and work in the fields or woods; no one envied them.</div>

<div class="line_en">The window looked out on a slope overgrown with the crooked bodies of apple trees. The woods cut off the view above the slope, and a crooked line of hills stretched into the distance. When, towards evening, a white moon made its way into the pale sky, Tereza would go and stand on the threshold. The sphere hanging in the not yet darkened sky seemed like a lamp they had forgotten to turn off in the morning, a lamp that had burned all day in the room of the dead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="窗户朝向一个山坡，坡上长满树干弯曲的苹果树。山坡的上方，果树林环抱着天际，只见山丘蜿蜒伸向远方。傍晚，灰白的天空现出一轮明月，特蕾莎总是在这个时候出门。天色还灰蒙蒙的，月亮挂在上面，就像是死人房间的一盏灯，早上忘了熄灭整天都在亮着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">None of the crooked apple trees growing along the slope could ever leave the spot where it had put down its roots, just as neither Tereza nor Tomas could ever leave their village. They had sold their car, their television set, and their radio to buy a tiny cottage and garden from a farmer who was moving to town.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="七歪八扭的苹果树生长在这片山坡上，没有一棵能离开它们扎根的地方，同样，特蕾莎和托马斯，他们也永远离不开这个村庄。他们卖了汽车、电视、收音机，用这笔钱买下了一幢带花园的小房子，房子原来的主人是一位农民，去城里定居了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Tereza was happy to abandon the city, the drunken barflies molesting her, and the anonymous women leaving the smell of their groins in Tomas's hair. The police stopped pestering them, and the incident with the engineer so merged with the scene on Petrin Hill that she was hard put to tell which was a dream and which the truth. (Was the engineer in fact employed by the secret police? Perhaps he was, perhaps not. Men who use borrowed flats for rendezvous and never make love to the same woman twice are not so rare.)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特蕾莎感到幸福，她终于离开了城市，远离了尽是喝得醉醺醺的酒鬼的酒吧，远离了将她们的下体味留在托马斯头发里的那些陌生女人。警方已不再找他俩的麻烦，而且，在特蕾莎的记忆中，工程师的事与发生在彼得山上的场面已经混合在一起，她已经难以分清什么是梦，什么是现实。（另外，工程师是否真的为秘密警察效力？也许是，也许不是。倒是总有那么些男人，借别人的房子私下幽会，而且还不喜欢跟同一个女人上两次床。）">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In any case, Tereza was happy and felt that she had at last reached her goal: she and Tomas were together and alone. Alone? Let me be more precise: living alone meant breaking with all their former friends and acquaintances, cutting their life in two like a ribbon; however, they felt perfectly at home in the company of the country people they worked with, and they sometimes exchanged visits with them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因此，特蕾莎确实感到幸福，认为已经达到了目的：如今托马斯跟她在一起，而且只有他俩。只他俩？我应说得更确切一些：离群索居，我的意思是他们与老朋友和熟人断绝了一切往来。他们与过去的生活一刀两断，就像用剪子把一根饰带一刀剪成两截。不过，与农民相处，他们倒是觉得很愉快，他俩和农民一起劳动，不时去拜访他们，也邀请他们来家里做客。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The day they met the chairman of the local collective farm at the spa that had Russian street names, Tereza discovered in herself a picture of country life originating in memories of books she had read or in her ancestors. It was a harmonious world; everyone came together in one big happy family with common interests and routines: church services on Sundays, a tavern where the men could get away from their womenfolk, and a hall in the tavern where a band played on Saturdays and the villagers danced.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天，特蕾莎结识了温泉小城的合作社主席，这座小城的街道全被改成了俄国的地名。就在那天，特蕾莎在自己脑海中突然发现了从书里看到或从前辈那儿听说的一幅乡村图景：这是一个和谐的世界，所有成员有着共同的利益，一致的习俗，组成了一个大家庭。每个星期六，乡村客栈的大厅里都有一支乐队演奏，全村的人都来这里跳舞；每个星期天，人们去教堂望弥撒，然后男人到客栈聚会，谁也不带妻子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Under Communism, however, village life no longer fit the age-old pattern. The church was in the neighboring village, and no one went there; the tavern had been turned into offices, so the men had nowhere to meet and drink beer, the young people nowhere to dance. Celebrating church holidays was forbidden, and no one cared about their secular replacements. The nearest cinema was in a town fifteen miles away. So, at the end of a day's work filled with boisterous shouting and relaxed chatter, they would all shut themselves up within their four walls and, surrounded by contemporary furniture emanating bad taste like a cold draft, stare at the refulgent television screen. They never paid one another visits besides dropping in on a neighbor for a word or two before supper. They all dreamed of moving into town. The country offered them nothing in the way of even a minimally interesting life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，共产主义制度下的这个村庄与那幅古老的景象完全不同。教堂在邻近的一个公社，谁也不去；客栈改成了办公室，男人们不知哪里有地方聚会喝啤酒，年轻人不知该去哪儿跳舞。宗教节日不能庆祝，官方节日又引不起任何人的兴趣。最近的电影院在城里，离开二十公里路。白天劳动时大伙儿只是互相打个招呼，等到间歇时才能说说话，放工后就回到小屋里，闭门不出；家具倒是现代的，可散发着难闻的气味；他们的双眼紧盯着闪亮的电视荧屏。大家互不往来，难得有人晚饭前去同邻居聊上几句。人人都梦想去城里定居。农村的生活太乏味了，很少有能给他们带来兴趣的东西。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Perhaps it was the fact that no one wished to settle there that caused the state to lose its power over the countryside. A farmer who no longer owns his own land and is merely a laborer tilling the soil forms no allegiance to either region or work; he has nothing to lose, nothing to fear for. As a result of such apathy, the countryside had maintained more than a modicum of autonomy and freedom. The chairman of the collective farm was not brought in from outside (as were all high-level managers in the city); he was elected by the villagers from among themselves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="也许正是谁也不愿在农村呆下去，国家才丧失了对农村的管制权。当农民不再是土地的主人，而只是一名被雇来种地的职工时，他就不再依恋这片家园和自己所从事的工作，他一无所有，因而也不惧怕会失去什么。这种漠然的态度倒使得农村保持了相当大的自主权和自由的空间。合作社主席不是外人强行指派的（同城里的领导不同），而是农民选举的，和农民是一伙人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The collective farm chairman became a truly close friend. He had a wife, four children, and a pig he raised like a dog. The pig's name was Mefisto, and he was the pride and main attraction of the village. He would answer his master's call and was always clean and pink; he paraded about on his hoofs like a heavy-thighed woman in high heels.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="合作社主席成了他们的真正的朋友。主席已结婚，有四个孩子，还有一头猪，却被当作狗来养着。猪的名字叫梅菲斯突，是全村的骄傲和开心宝。它很听话，爱清洁，一身粉红色，迈着小步，活像那些穿着高跟鞋走路的大腿肚女人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When Karenin first saw Mefisto, he was very upset and circled him, sniffing, for a long time. But he soon made friends with him, even to the point of preferring him to the village dogs. Indeed, he had nothing but scorn for the dogs, because they were all chained to their doghouses and never stopped their silly, unmotivated barking. Karenin correctly assessed the value of being one of a kind, and I can state without compunction that he greatly appreciated his friendship with the pig.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡列宁第一次见到梅菲斯突时，有些不知所措，在它身边转了很久，不停地嗅它。但它很快就与梅菲斯突建立起了友谊，喜欢它胜于村里所有的狗，卡列宁看不起那些狗，因为它们一直被拴在窝旁，还无缘无故傻呵呵地叫个不停。卡列宁欣赏与众不同的东西，可以说它非常珍惜与梅菲斯突的这份友谊。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Because everyone wanted to leave, Tereza and Tomas were in an exceptional position: they had come voluntarily. If the other villagers took advantage of every opportunity to make day trips to the surrounding towns, Tereza and Tomas were content to remain where they were, which meant that before long they knew the villagers better than the villagers knew one another.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="由于这里的人都想走，特蕾莎和托马斯便拥有了特殊的地位，他们是自愿来的。别人都不失时机地去附近的小镇过上一天，特蕾莎和托马斯却巴不得呆在村子里，所以很快，他们就同全村人混熟了，比原来的村民之间还熟。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Karenin always kept her company. He learned to bark at the young cows when they got too frisky and tried to go off on their own; he did so with obvious zest. He was definitely the happiest of the three. Never before had his position as keeper of the clock been so respected. The country was no place for improvisation; the time in which Tereza and Tomas lived was growing closer to the regularity of his time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡列宁总是陪着她。每当小母牛淘气，想离队时，它就汪汪叫着追赶它们；它显然是乐在其中。他们三个当中，卡列宁是最幸福的。这个“时间总管”的职责过去从未受到如此的尊重，因为这里没有任何临时变动的机会，特蕾莎和托马斯所生活的时间与卡列宁的时间规律性很接近。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The collective farm had four large cow sheds as well as a small stable of forty heifers. Tereza was charged with looking after them and taking them out to pasture twice a day. Because the closer, easily accessible meadows would eventually be mowed, she had to take her herd into the surrounding hills for grazing, gradually moving farther and farther out and, in the course of the year, covering all the pastureland round about. As in her small-town youth, she was never without a book, and the minute she reached the day's pasture she would open it and read.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="合作社有四座大饲养楼，外加一个有四十头母牛的小牛栏。这些母牛由特蕾莎照料，每天放牧两次。牧场就在附近，去很容易，可这些牧场是专门用来收割草料的，特蕾莎只好把牛带到附近的山冈上。牛吃着草，越走越远，特蕾莎跟着它们，一年内便跑遍了小村周围的地区。就像从前在小城里一样，她手里总拿着一本书，一到牧场，她就打开书，看起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The chairman was glad to be able to help his former surgeon, though at the same time sad that he could do nothing more. Tomas became the driver of the pickup truck that took the farm workers out to the fields and hauled equipment.</div>
