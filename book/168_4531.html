<div class="line_en">After the second time he fell from the saddle, they bound him tight to Brienne of Tarth and made them share a horse again. One day, instead of back to front, they bound them face-to-face. "The lovers," Shagwell sighed loudly, "and what a lovely sight they are. 'Twould be cruel to separate the good knight and his lady." Then he laughed that high shrill laugh of his, and said, "Ah, but which one is the knight and which one is the lady?"</div>

<div class="line_en">He had taken wounds before, but never like this. He had never known there could be such pain. Sometimes, unbidden, old prayers bubbled from his lips, prayers he learned as a child and never thought of since, prayers he had first prayed with Cersei kneeling beside him in the sept at Casterly Rock. Sometimes he even wept, until he heard the Mummers laughing. Then he made his eyes go dry and his heart go dead, and prayed for his fever to burn away his tears. Now I know how Tyrion has felt, all those times they laughed at him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他经常受伤，但从未有过如此的屈辱，从未品尝这般的疼痛。这些天来，他的嘴唇经常无法抑制地背诵起幼稚的祷词，那些他孩童时代学习却从不在意的祷词，那些他和瑟曦并肩跪在凯岩城圣堂里念诵的祷词。他哭了又哭，直到听见血戏子们的笑声，便不再悲伤。他风干眼睛，铁石心肠，希望高烧能带走眼泪。我终于明白了提利昂的感受，一辈子都有人嘲笑他。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">His hand was always between them. Urswyck had hung it about his neck on a cord, so it dangled down against his chest, slapping Brienne's breasts as Jaime slipped in and out of consciousness. His right eye was swollen shut, the wound inflamed where Brienne had cut him during their fight, but it was his hand that hurt the most. Blood and pus seeped from his stump, and the missing hand throbbed every time the horse took a step.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的手还在，就在两人中间。乌斯威克将它套着绳子，挂在他脖子上，马儿行进，詹姆恍恍惚惚，手便在胸前摇摆，抓挠布蕾妮的乳房。他的右眼肿得睁不开，先前打斗中布蕾妮伤他的地方发了炎，但最痛的是手。断肢不断渗出血液和浓汁，马儿踏一步，幻影手便抽搐一下。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">If I had my hand, you'd learn that soon enough, Jaime thought. His arms ached and his legs were numb from the ropes, but after a while none of that mattered. His world shrunk to the throb of agony that was his phantom hand, and Brienne pressed against him. She's warm, at least, he consoled himself, though the wench's breath was as foul as his own.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果我的手还在，你就会明白的，詹姆心想。因为长期捆绑，四肢全部麻木，但一切都没关系了，他的世界只剩下那只幻影手传来的疼痛，以及布蕾妮压在身上的重量。至少她很温暖，他宽慰自己，虽然呼吸和我的一样扑鼻难闻。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His throat was so raw that he could not eat, but he drank wine when they gave it to him, and water when that was all they offered. Once they handed him a cup and he quaffed it straight away, trembling, and the Brave Companions burst into laughter so loud and harsh it hurt his ears. "That's horse piss you're drinking, Kingslayer," Rorge told him. Jaime was so thirsty he drank it anyway, but afterward he retched it all back up. They made Brienne wash the vomit out of his beard, just as they made her clean him up when he soiled himself in the saddle.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="咽喉干燥，无法进食，他只喝他们给的酒和清水。曾有一回，“勇士们”给他一杯水，他颤抖着一饮而尽，引来周围哄堂大笑，格外刺耳。“这是马尿，弑君者，”罗尔杰告诉他。詹姆太口渴，因此没注意，但随后倔强地吐了出来。于是他们让布蕾妮替他清理胡须，平时他在马鞍上流屎流尿他们也总逼她清理。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One damp cold morning when he was feeling slightly stronger, a madness took hold of him and he reached for the Dornishman's sword with his left hand and wrenched it clumsily from its scabbard. Let them kill me, he thought, so long as I die fighting, a blade in hand. But it was no good. Shagwell came hopping from leg to leg, dancing nimbly aside when Jaime slashed at him. Unbalanced, he staggered forward, hacking wildly at the fool, but Shagwell spun and ducked and darted until all the Mummers were laughing at Jaime's futile efforts to land a blow. When he tripped over a rock and stumbled to his knees, the fool leapt in and planted a wet kiss atop his head.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="某个阴冷的清晨，他感觉有点力气了，顿时被一股疯狂所攫住。他用左手抓住多恩人的剑柄，笨拙地拔出来。让他们杀了我，他心想，我要手执武器，死在战斗中。没用。夏格维单脚跳来跳去，詹姆就是砍不中，最后失去平衡，跌跌撞撞地向前猛扑。小丑绕了几圈，躲闪开来，血戏子们哄笑着观看骑士与小丑的表演。他绊住石头，跪倒在地，小丑跳过来，在他额头印上一个潮湿的吻。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Rorge finally flung him aside and kicked the sword from Jaime's feeble fingers as he tried to bring it up. "That wath amuthing, Kingthlayer," said Vargo Hoat, "but if you try it again, I thall. take your other hand, or perhapth a foot."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="罗尔杰最后上前教训他，并从他虚弱的指头中踢走长剑。“狠有趣，四君者，”瓦格·赫特说，“但下不为里，否责我再砍你一只手，或责一只脚。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jaime lay on his back afterward, staring at the night sky, trying not to feel the pain that snaked up his right arm every time he moved it. The night was strangely beautiful. The moon was a graceful crescent, and it seemed as though he had never seen so many stars. The King's Crown was at the zenith, and he could see the Stallion rearing, and there the Swan. The Moonmaid, shy as ever, was half-hidden behind a pine tree. How can such a night be beautiful? he asked himself. Why would the stars want to look down on such as me?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="詹姆躺下，看着夜晚的晴空，试图不去在意右臂无时不在的疼痛。夜，奇特地美，优雅的新月，前所未见的满天繁星。王冠座在天顶，旁边有骏马座和天鹅座，松树枝头，羞答答的月女座半遮半掩。夜，怎可如此地美？他扪心自问，星星竟舍得为我洒下光辉？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The word shocked him. He was Jaime Lannister, a knight of the Kingsguard, he was the Kingslayer. No man had ever called him craven. Other things they called him, yes; oathbreaker, liar, murderer. They said he was cruel, treacherous, reckless. But never craven. "What else can I do, but die?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个词让他震惊。他是詹姆·兰尼斯特，他是御林铁卫的骑士，他是弑君者。没人可以叫他懦夫，其他的称号——背誓者、骗子、杀人犯、屠夫、叛徒、莽汉等等都无所谓，就不能容忍懦夫。“我除了死，还能做什么呢？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">When morning came, he made himself eat. They fed him a mush of oats, horse food, but he forced down every spoon. He ate again at evenfall, and the next day. Live, he told himself harshly, when the mush was like to gag him, live for Cersei, live for Tyrion. Live for vengeance. A Lannister always pays his debts. His missing hand throbbed and burned and stank. When I reach King's Landing I'll have a new hand forged, a golden hand, and one day I'll use it to rip out Vargo Hoat's throat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天黎明，他强迫自己吃东西，他们给他些许麦糊，马的食物，但他一匙一匙咽下去。傍晚时又吃了，第二天早上也吃。活下去，每当麦糊哽在喉头，他便严厉地告诫自己，为了瑟曦，为了提利昂，为了复仇，活下去。兰尼斯特有债必还。幻影手抽搐、灼痛和发臭。等我回到君临，会打造一只新手，一只金手，总有一天，要用它撕开山羊的喉咙。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The days and the nights blurred together in a haze of pain. He would sleep in the saddle, pressed against Brienne, his nose full of the stink of his rotting hand, and then at night he would lie awake on the hard ground, caught in a waking nightmare. Weak as he was, they always bound him to a tree. It gave him some cold consolation to know that they feared him that much, even now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在无边的疼痛中，日夜模糊不清。白天昏睡在马鞍上，靠住布蕾妮的身子，闻着手掌腐烂的恶臭；晚上清醒地躺在硬泥地里，因噩梦而难以入眠。他虽虚弱，但血戏子们仍不敢大意，始终将他绑在树上。想到敌人如此怕他，他不由得感到一丝冰冷的慰籍。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Brienne was always bound beside him. She lay there in her bonds like a big dead cow, saying not a word. The wench has built a fortress inside herself. They will rape her soon enough, but behind her walls they cannot touch her. But Jaime's walls were gone. They had taken his hand, they had taken his sword hand, and without it he was nothing. The other was no good to him. Since the time he could walk, his left arm had been his shield arm, no more. It was his right hand that made him a knight; his right arm that made him a man.</div>

<div class="line_en">One day, he heard Urswyck say something about Harrenhal, and remembered that was to be their destination.

<div class="line_en">It was the next night when they finally came, three of the worst; Shagwell, noseless Rorge, and the fat Dothraki Zollo, the one who'd cut his hand off. Zollo and Rorge were arguing about who would go first as they approached; there seemed to be no question but that the fool would be going last. Shagwell suggested that they should both go first, and take her front and rear. Zollo and Rorge liked that notion, only then they began to fight about who would get the front and who the rear.</div>

Yet he heard himself whisper, "Let them do it, and go away inside." That was what he'd done, when the Starks had died before him, Lord Rickard cooking in his armor while his son Brandon strangled himself trying to save him. "Think of Renly, if you loved him.

<div class="line_cn" title="他们会毁了她心中的城堡，把她变成和我一样的残废。“妞儿，”趁佐罗和罗尔杰互相喝骂的当口，他低声说，“让他们做，什么也别想。心思走得远远的，他们享受不到乐趣，很快就停了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
