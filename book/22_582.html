We were to keep to Maud's parlour till midnight, then go. He was to meet us at the river when the clock struck the half.</div>

<div class="line_en">Gentleman went first. Mr Lilly and Maud stood at the door to see him leave, and I watched from her window. She shook his hand and he made her a bow. Then the trap took him off, to the station at Marlow. He sat with folded arms, his hat put back, his face our way, his eyes now on hers, now on mine.</div>

<div class="line_en">That day passed just like all the old ones. Maud went to her uncle, as she had used to do, and I went slowly about her rooms, looking over her things -- only this time, of course, I was looking out for what we ought to take. We sat at lunch. We walked in the park, to the ice-house, the graves, and the river. It was the final time we would do it, yet things looked the same as they always had. It was us who had changed. We walked, not speaking. Now and then our skirts came together -- and once, our hands -- and we started apart, as if stung; but if, like me, she coloured, I don't know, for I didn't look at her. Back in her room she stood still, like a statue. Only now and then I heard her sigh.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天过得一如往常。莫德象以前一样去见她舅舅。而我在她房间里慢慢地走来走去，检查她的东西——当然，只是这次，我是在检查我们该带什么东西走。我们吃午餐。我们在花园里散步，到冰室，墓地，河边。这是我们最后一次散步了，不过一切似乎跟以往一样。是我们改变了。我们走着，没说话。我们裙子时不时地碰到一起——还有一次，我们手碰在一起——仿佛被针扎了似的，我们赶紧分开。不过，不知她是否象我一样，脸上变了颜色，我没看她。回到她的房间里，她一动不动地站着，象座雕塑。我只能听到她不时叹息。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I said Good-night, and went upstairs. Maud of course was still with her uncle. Until she came I did what we had planned, and got together all the gowns and shoes and bits and pieces we had agreed ought to be taken. It was all of it hers. My brown stuff dress I left behind me. I hadn't worn it in more than a month. I put it at the bottom of my trunk. I left that, too. We could only take bags. Maud had found out two old things of her mother's. Their leather was damp, with a bloom of white. They were marked, in brass, with letters so bold even I could read them: an M and an L -- for her mother's name, which was like hers. I lined them with paper, and packed them tight. In one -- the heaviest one, which I would carry -- I put the jewels I'd shined. I wrapped them in linen, to save them from tumbling about and growing dull. I put in one of her gloves with them -- a white kid glove, with buttons of pearl. She had worn it once and supposed it lost. I meant to keep it, to remind me of her.</div>

I made her sit and take a little, then I wet a handkerchief with it and rubbed at the hollows of her brow.

I put my mouth to the thread to bite it, and tasted salt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我走进她的卧室，打开包袱，留她一个人在窗边。我把裙子和亚麻布都拿出来，重新收拾。这时，我抻一个带扣上的带子，带子抻断了。我找了根针，开始缝带子，针脚缝得粗大杂乱。">查看中文翻译</div>

She held my hand again, and I showed her where to run.</div>

<div class="line_en">Only once I felt her hesitate, and then I turned and found her gazing at the house, with a queer expression that seemed half-fearful and yet was almost a smile.

<div class="line_en">She turned her head and did not look again. We walked quickly to the wall of the park, and then we followed it, along a damp and tangled path. The bushes caught at the wool of our cloaks, and creatures leapt in the grass, or slithered before us; and there were cobwebs, fine and shining like wires of glass, that we must trample through and break. The noise seemed awful. Our breaths came harder. We walked so long, I thought we had missed the gate to the river; but then the path grew clearer, and the arch sprang up, lit bright by the moon. Maud moved past me and took out her key, and let us through it, then made the gate fast at our backs.</div>

<div class="line_en">I don't remember if Gentleman spoke. I don't believe he looked at me, except, once he had helped Maud across the ancient landing-place, to give me his hand and guide me as he had guided her, over the rotten planks. I think we did it all in silence. I know the boat was narrow, and our skirts bulged as we sat -- for, when Gentleman took up the oars to turn us, we rocked again, and I grew suddenly frightened of the boat capsizing, imagining the water filling all those folds and frills and sucking us under. But Maud sat steady. I saw Gentleman looking her over. Still no-one spoke, however. We had done it all in a moment, and the boat moved quick. The stream was with us.</div>

<div class="line_en">About the bend of the silvery river came the dark shape of a boat. I saw the oars dip and rise, and scatter coins of moonlight; then they were drawn high, and left a silence. The boat glided towards the rushes, then rocked and creaked again as Gentleman half-rose from his seat. He could not see us, where we waited in the shadow of the wall. He could not see us; but it was not me who stepped forward first, it was her.

A dog came up and started barking. Gentleman kicked it and made it yelp. He led us to the cottage that was nearest the church, and the door was opened, a man came out, and then a woman, holding a lantern. They had been waiting.

She was studying her pale, set, handsome face, her look of sickness, and I knew she was thinking -- as anyone would think, I suppose -- that she was in the family way, and marrying out of fear. Perhaps Gentleman had even made her think it, when he spoke to her before.

<div class="line_en">There were two shut doors there, leading to the two little bedrooms of the house. The first had a narrow straw mattress on a pallet on the floor, and was for me. The second had a bigger bed, an arm-chair and a press, and was for Gentleman and Maud. She went into it, and stood with her eyes on the floor, looking at nothing. There was a single candle lit. Her bags lay beside the bed. I went to them and took her things out, one by one, and put them in the press. Mrs Cream said, "What handsome linen!" -- She was watching from the door. Gentleman stood with her, looking strange. It was him that had taught me the handling of a petticoat but now, seeing me take out Maud's shimmies and stockings, he seemed almost afraid. He said, "Well, I shall smoke a final cigarette downstairs. Sue, you'll make things comfortable up here?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Gentleman took her arm and held it, and then he led her from the church. There had come clouds before the moon, and the night was darker. The parson shook hands with us, then made Maud a bow; then he went off. He went fast, and as he walked he took his robe off, and his clothes were black beneath it -- he seemed to snuff himself out like a light. Mrs Cream took us to her cottage. She carried the lantern, and we walked behind her, stumbling on her path: her doorway was low, and knocked Gentleman's hat off. She took us up a set of tilting stairs too narrow for our skirts, and then to a landing, about as big as a cupboard, where we all jostled about for a moment and the cuff of Maud's cloak got laid upon the chimney of the lantern and was singed.</div>

<div class="line_en">She looked at me, as she looked at everything -- the plate of eggs, the view beyond the window, the gown I held up to place over her head -- with a soft, odd, distant kind of gaze; and when I spoke to her, to ask her some trifling thing, she listened, and waited, then answered and blinked, as if the question, and the answer -- even the movement of her own throat making the words -- were all perfectly surprising and strange. I dressed her, and she sat again beside the window.

<div class="line_en">She sat and leaned her head back, and he sat beside her. I sat opposite. There were no handles to the doors, only a key, like the key to a safe: when the driver closed them Gentleman made them fast, then put the key in his pocket.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她坐在车里，仰着头，他坐在她旁边。我坐她对面。马车门上没有把手，只有一把钥匙，好象是为了保险：车夫关上马车门，绅士就把门锁上了，然后他把钥匙收进口袋。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In time I began to grow sick. I saw Maud's head rolling against the padding of the seat, but could not see if her eyes were open or closed. She kept her hands before her, clasped. Gentleman fidgeted, however, loosening his collar, looking at his watch, plucking at his cuffs. Two or three times he took out his handkerchief and wiped off his brow. Every time the coach slowed, he leaned close to the window to peer through the louvres. Then it slowed so hard it came almost to a stop, and began to turn: he looked again, sat straight and tightened his neck-tie.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="很快，我开始感觉不舒服了，我看到莫德脑袋靠在靠垫上摇晃着，不过看不出她眼睛是睁是闭。她手放在身前，双手紧紧握着。而绅士却坐立不安，他放开了领子，看着怀表，摘着袖口的线头。有两三次，他掏出手绢擦拭额头。每次马车放慢速度，他都要凑到窗边，从百叶窗里张望出去。这时马车走的非常慢，慢到好象停下来了，在转弯：他又凑过去看，然后坐直了，拉紧领带。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"How long will we travel?" asked Maud.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我们要走多长时间？”莫德问道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It seemed longer than an hour. It seemed like a life. The day was a warm one. Where the sun struck the glass it made the carriage very hot, but the windows had been fixed not to open -- I suppose, so a lunatic should not have the chance to leap out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="好象走了不止一个钟头。好象走了一辈子。天气很暖和，太阳直直照着窗玻璃，车厢里被烤的异常闷热，而车窗是固定住的，打不开——我猜想，这样一来，疯子就没机会跳车而逃了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Maud turned her head to him. The coach slowed again. I pulled the cord that moved the blinds. We were at the start of a green lane, with a stone arch across it and, beneath that, iron gates. A man was drawing them back. The coach gave a jerk, and we drove along the lane until we reached the house at the end. It was just like at Briar, though this house was smaller, and neater. Its windows had bars on them. I watched Maud, to see what she would do. She had put back her veil and was gazing from the window in her old dull way; but behind the dullness I thought I saw a rising kind of knowledge or dread.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莫德转过头对着他。马车又慢下来。我拽拽百叶窗的绳子，把窗叶拉起来。我们前面是一扇带石头拱顶的铸铁大门，门里有一条绿色通道。一个男的拉开大门，马车朝前抽了一下，就走驶上了绿色通道。马车最后走到通道尽头的一所房子前。那房子就象布莱尔的李宅一样，虽然比李宅小点儿，整齐点儿。房子窗户上都钉着铁条。我望着莫德，想看看她会做什么。她把面纱掀到后面，以她惯有的呆呆的样子，从窗户上盯着外面。可在那呆滞的表象后面，我觉得我看到一种觉醒，或者说恐慌，正在冒出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That was all he said. I don't know if he said it to her, or to me. The coach made another turn, and stopped. Dr Graves and Dr Christie were there, waiting for us, with beside them a great stout woman, her sleeves pushed up to her elbows and her gown covered over with an apron of canvas, like a butcher's. Dr Christie came forward. He had a key like Gentleman's, and let up the lock from his side. Maud flinched at the sound. Gentleman put his hand upon her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他就说了这么一句话。我也不知他是跟她说，还是跟我说，马车又转了个弯才停下。格里夫斯医生和克里斯蒂医生在那里等我们，他们旁边站着一个高大健壮的女人，她袖子挽到肘部，裙子外面系着一块帆布围裙，象个屠户一样。克里斯蒂医生走上前。他拿着一把钥匙，跟绅士收起来的那把一样，他从外面打开马车门。莫德听到他开门的动静，面露惧色。绅士把手放在她身上。">查看中文翻译</div>
