<div class="line_en">In a flash of insight she had told Charlie that Walter had sent her to him with the threat of divorce as the alternative to her accompanying him to the stricken city in order that she might see for herself how indifferent, cowardly, and selfish he was. It was true. It was a trick which accorded very well with his sardonic humour. He knew exactly what would happen and he had given her amah necessary instructions before her return. She had caught in his eyes a disdain which seemed to include her lover as well as herself. He said to himself, perhaps, that if he had been in Townsend's place nothing in the world would have hindered him from making any sacrifice to gratify her smallest whim. She knew that was true also. But then, when her eyes were opened, how could he make her do something which was so dangerous, and which he must know frightened her so terribly? At first she thought he was only playing with her and till they actually started, no, later, till they left the river and took to the chairs for the journey across country, she thought he would give that little laugh of his and tell her that she need not come. She had no inkling of what was in his mind. He could not really desire her death. He had loved her so desperately. She knew what love was now and she remembered a thousand signs of his adoration. For him really, in the French phrase, she did make fine weather and foul. It was impossible that he did not love her still. Did you cease to love a person because you had been treated cruelly? She had not made him suffer as Charlie had made her suffer and yet, if Charlie made a sign, notwithstanding everything, even though she knew him now, she would abandon all the world had to offer and fly to his arms. Even though he had sacrificed her and cared nothing for her, even though he was callous and unkind, she loved him.</div>

<div class="line_en">On the steamer that took them up the Western River Walter read incessantly, but at meal-times he endeavoured to make some kind of conversation. He talked to her as though she were a stranger with whom he happened to be making the journey, of indifferent things, from politeness, Kitty imagined, or because so he could render more marked the gulf that separated them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汽船沿着西江逆流而上的时候，瓦尔特一刻不停地读他的书。到了吃饭的时间，他会尝试跟她闲聊两句。他说的都是无关紧要的琐碎小事儿，就好像她是和他旅途邂逅 的一位从未谋面的女士。凯蒂觉得他开口仅仅是出于一位绅士的礼貌，或者是故意提醒她，他们之间隔着一道不可逾越的鸿沟。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At first she thought that she had only to bide her time, and sooner or later Walter would forgive her. She had been too confident of her power over him to believe that it was gone for ever. Many waters could not quench love. He was weak if he loved her, and she felt that love her he must.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="开始她以为时间一长瓦尔特就会原谅她。然而凭她的魅力让这事儿说过去就过去了，她还是过于自信了一点。大水也浇不灭爱火，如果他爱她就迟早会心软的，还会无法自拔地继续爱她下去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But now she was not quite sure. When in the evening he sat reading in the straight-backed blackguard chair of the inn with the light of a hurricane lamp on his face she was able to watch him at her ease. She lay on the pallet on which her bed presently would be set and she was in shadow. Those straight, regular features of his made his face look very severe. You could hardly believe that it was possible for them on occasion to be changed by so sweet a smile. He was able to read as calmly as though she were a thousand miles away; she saw him turn the pages and she saw his eyes move regularly as they travelled from line to line. He was not thinking of her. And when, the table being set and dinner brought in, he put aside his book and gave her a glance (not knowing how the light on his face threw into distinctness his expression), she was startled to see in his eyes a look of physical distaste. Yes, it startled her. Was it possible that his love had left him entirely? Was it possible that he really designed her death? It was absurd. That would be the act of a madman. It was odd, the little shiver that ran through her as the thought occurred to her that perhaps Walter was not quite sane.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而关于这一点她不是那么确信了。晚上他坐在客栈的直背黑木椅上读书时，马灯的灯光打到他的脸上，她得以细细地观察他。她正躺在一张已然称其为床铺的草垫上，光线照不到她，不必担心被他发觉。他脸上平削的线条使他的神情显得十分严峻，这张脸上要想挤出甜美的一笑，实在是不可能。他心平气和地读着书，好像视她根本不存在。她看到他翻了一页，目光在书页上来回地游移。看来他没有胡思乱想。等到桌子摆好，晚饭端进来时，他收起了书，朝她看了一眼（他根本没有意识到在灯光的映照下，他的表情异常地醒目）。那是嫌恶的一瞥，把她吓得魂飞魄散。是的，她太惊惧了，难道他的爱情已经消失了吗？难道他真的预备害死她？那是荒谬的，那是疯子的行为。瓦尔特可能已经疯了，这个诡异的想法叫她不禁颤抖了一下。">查看中文翻译</div>
