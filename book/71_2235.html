<div class="line_en">In the event, the inspector was visiting the rooms, cells and dungeons, one after the other. Several prisoners were questioned -- those who had earned the goodwill of the governors by their mild manner or sheer stupidity. The inspector asked them how they were fed and any demands that they might have to make.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dantès heard all the trundling and grinding of preparations from the depth of his cell: there was a great deal of commotion upstairs, but the noise would have been imperceptible below for any ear other than that of a prisoner who was accustomed to hearing, in the silence of night, the sound made by a spider spinning its web or the regular fall of a drop of water which took an hour to gather on the ceiling of his dungeon.</div>

Have you got any others?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'll see them both," replied the inspector. "We must be conscientious about our work." He was carrying out his very first tour of inspection and wanted to make a good impression on the authorities.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我们先去看这一个。”他又说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You are right, Monsieur," said the governor. "Your remark proves that you have given the matter a good deal of thought. As it happens, in a dungeon not more than twenty feet away from this one which is reached by another staircase, we have an old abbé, a former leader of a faction in Italy, who has been here since 1811 and who lost his wits around the end of 1813. Since then, he has been physically unrecognizable: he used to weep, now he laughs; he was growing thin, now he is putting on weight. Would you like to see him instead of this one? His madness is entertaining; it won't depress you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“您说得不错，阁下，”堡长回答说，“这句话证明您对这一行很有研究，现在，大约再走二十步，下一层楼梯，我们就可以在一间黑牢里看见一个长老，他是意大利一个政党的老领袖，自从一八一一年起他就在这儿了，一八一三年发了疯，从那时起，他就来了一个惊人的转变。他以前老是哭，他现在笑了。他以前愈来愈瘦，现在胖起来了。您最好还是去看看他，别去看那个，因为他疯得很有趣。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Certainly," said the governor, indicating to the turnkey that he should open the door.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dantès was crouching in a corner of the dungeon where he had the unspeakable happiness of enjoying the thin ray of daylight that filtered through the bars of a narrow window; hearing the grating of the massive locks and the screech of the rusty doorpost turning in its socket, he looked up. At the sight of a stranger, lit by two turnkeys with torches, who was being addressed by the governor, hat in hand, together with two soldiers, Dantès guessed what was going on and, seeing at last an opportunity to petition a higher authority, leapt forward with his hands clasped.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dantès realized that he had been depicted as someone dangerous; so he summoned up a look that expressed the utmost leniency and humility and spoke with a kind of pious eloquence that astonished everyone, in an attempt to touch the heart of his visitor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓蒂斯看出他已被人认为是一个危险的犯人。于是，他脸上装出一个心地最温顺，最卑微的人所能有的全部表情，用一种震惊四座的虔敬的雄辩滔滔而言，想打动巡察的心。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I want to know what crime I have committed, I am asking for judges to be appointed to my case and for a trial to be held; finally, I am asking to be shot, if I am guilty; but equally to be set free if I am innocent."</div>

"Oh, Monsieur, you do not know what seventeen months are in prison: seventeen years, seventeen centuries; above all for a man like myself, who was on the brink of happiness, for a man like myself, who was about to marry a woman whom he loved, for a man who could see an honourable career ahead of him and who was deprived of it all in a moment; who, from the most glorious day, was plunged into the deepest night, who saw his career destroyed, who does not know if the woman who loved him does so still, who cannot tell if his old father is alive or dead. Seventeen months of prison, for a man accustomed to the sea air, to a sailor's independence, to space, immensity, infinity! Monsieur, seventeen months of prison is more than enough punishment for all the crimes reviled by the most odious names known to the tongues of men. Have pity on me, Monsieur, and beg for me, not indulgence, but firmness; not a pardon, but a verdict. A judge, Monsieur, I ask only for a judge: an accused man cannot be refused a judge."</div>

He did not even look up at the noise made by the opening of the cell door, but only appeared to become aware of something when the beams of the torches cast an unfamiliar light on the damp ground where he was working.

When that time had expired, he decided that it had been ridiculous of him to think that the inspector would have taken up his case before returning to Paris. Since he could not return to Paris until the end of his tour of inspection, which might last a month or two, he gave himself three months instead of a fortnight. When the three months had passed, he found consolation in a different argument, with the result that he allowed six months; but when the six months were over, adding up all the days, it appeared that he had waited for ten and a half months. Nothing, in these ten months, had changed in the conditions of his imprisonment; he had received no encouraging news and when he questioned his jailer the man remained silent, as usual. Dantès began to doubt the evidence of his senses -- to think that what he had taken for a memory was nothing more than a hallucination and that the ministering angel who had appeared to him in his prison had flown in on the wings of a dream.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="日子一天又一天，一星期又一星期的过去，后来是一月又一月的过去，邓蒂斯依旧期待着。他最初预期可在两星期以内释放，这两星期过去了。他然后想到，巡察在回到巴黎以前是不会有所行动的，而他要在巡查完毕以后才能到那儿，所以他定期为三个月。三个月过去了，三个月之后又过了六个月。在这许多日期间，并没有发生什么有利的转变。于是邓蒂斯开始幻想，认为巡察的视察只是一个梦，只是脑子里的一个幻想。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A year later, the governor was transferred: he had been appointed to manage the fort at Ham, and took with him several of his subordinates, including Dantès' jailer. A new governor arrived. It would have taken him too long to learn the names of his prisoners, so he asked only to be told their numbers. There were fifty furnished rooms in this frightful lodging-house. Its inhabitants were called by the number of the one that they occupied, and the unfortunate young man was no longer called by his first name, Edmond, or his family name, Dantès. He became Number 34.</div>
