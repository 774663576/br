<div class="line_en">At last Monday came, and Philip thought his long torture was over. Looking out the trains he found that the latest by which Griffiths could reach home that night left Oxford soon after one, and he supposed that Mildred would take one which started a few minutes later to bring her to London. His desire was to go and meet it, but he thought Mildred would like to be left alone for a day; perhaps she would drop him a line in the evening to say she was back, and if not he would call at her lodgings next morning: his spirit was cowed. He felt a bitter hatred for Griffiths, but for Mildred, notwithstanding all that had passed, only a heart-rending desire. He was glad now that Hayward was not in London on Saturday afternoon when, distraught, he went in search of human comfort: he could not have prevented himself from telling him everything, and Hayward would have been astonished at his weakness. He would despise him, and perhaps be shocked or disgusted that he could envisage the possibility of making Mildred his mistress after she had given herself to another man. What did he care if it was shocking or disgusting? He was ready for any compromise, prepared for more degrading humiliations still, if he could only gratify his desire.</div>

<div class="line_en">Towards the evening his steps took him against his will to the house in which she lived, and he looked up at her window. It was dark. He did not venture to ask if she was back. He was confident in her promise. But there was no letter from her in the morning, and, when about mid-day he called, the maid told him she had not arrived. He could not understand it. He knew that Griffiths would have been obliged to go home the day before, for he was to be best man at a wedding, and Mildred had no money. He turned over in his mind every possible thing that might have happened. He went again in the afternoon and left a note, asking her to dine with him that evening as calmly as though the events of the last fortnight had not happened. He mentioned the place and time at which they were to meet, and hoping against hope kept the appointment: though he waited for an hour she did not come. On Wednesday morning he was ashamed to ask at the house and sent a messenger-boy with a letter and instructions to bring back a reply; but in an hour the boy came back with Philip's letter unopened and the answer that the lady had not returned from the country. Philip was beside himself. The last deception was more than he could bear. He repeated to himself over and over again that he loathed Mildred, and, ascribing to Griffiths this new disappointment, he hated him so much that he knew what was the delight of murder: he walked about considering what a joy it would be to come upon him on a dark night and stick a knife into his throat, just about the carotid artery, and leave him to die in the street like a dog. Philip was out of his senses with grief and rage. He did not like whiskey, but he drank to stupefy himself. He went to bed drunk on the Tuesday and on the Wednesday night.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="快到傍晚，他的腿像是不受控制一样往米尔德里德的住处迈。到了楼下，抬头看她的窗户，里面漆黑一片。他不敢冒险去看看她回来了没有。他对她的承诺坚信不疑。可第二天早上仍然没有她的来信，到了中午又忍不住去了她住的地方，听女仆说她一直都没回来。他傻眼了。格里菲斯昨天就该回家了，他要给朋友的婚礼当伴郎。米尔德里德身上又没有钱，不回伦敦能去哪儿呢？菲利普把所有可能发生的情况都在脑子里过了一遍。下午又去找了米尔德里德一趟，还留了张便条问她晚上要不要一起吃饭，语气平静得像这两个礼拜什么都没发生过一样。他告知了晚上碰面的时间和地点，心里抱着一线希望等待她的到来。可他足足等了四个钟头，始终没见她现身。礼拜三早晨，他不好意思再去她那儿打听了，于是差一个送信的男孩捎了封信去，还专程嘱咐说务必回信。一个小时以后，男孩带着未拆封的信回来了，说那位女士还没有从乡下回来。菲利普气得发狂。他实在受不了这一而再、再而三的欺骗了。他反反复复地麻痹自己，说他恨死米尔德里德了。还把整件事都怪罪在格里菲斯身上，恨不得杀了他才能一雪前耻、快人心意。他走来走去，盘算着在一个伸手不见五指的黑夜向他扑过去，拿把刀子直插喉咙，不偏不倚地戳进颈动脉，让他像条癞皮狗一样惨死在大街上。悲伤和愤怒害他失去了理智。他不喜欢威士忌的味道，却痛饮数杯只为麻木自己。礼拜二三连着两天晚上，他都是喝得酩酊大醉才爬上床的。">查看中文翻译</div>

I know I oughtn't to have gone away with Milly, but I simply couldn't help myself. She simply carried me off my feet and I would have done anything to get her. When she told me you had offered us the money to go I simply couldn't resist. And now it's all over I'm awfully ashamed of myself and I wish I hadn't been such a fool. I wish you'd write and say you're not angry with me, and I want you to let me come and see you. I was awfully hurt at your telling Milly you didn't want to see me. Do write me a line, there's a good chap, and tell me you forgive me. It'll ease my conscience. I thought you wouldn't mind or you wouldn't have offered the money. But I know I oughtn't to have taken it. I came home on Monday and Milly wanted to stay a couple of days at Oxford by herself. She's going back to London on Wednesday, so by the time you receive this letter you will have seen her and I hope everything will go off all right. Do write and say you forgive me.

He might have known that she would do this; she had never cared for him, she had made a fool of him from the beginning; she had no pity, she had no kindness, she had no charity. The only thing was to accept the inevitable. The pain he was suffering was horrible, he would sooner be dead than endure it; and the thought came to him that it would be better to finish with the whole thing: he might throw himself in the river or put his neck on a railway line; but he had no sooner set the thought into words than he rebelled against it. His reason told him that he would get over his unhappiness in time; if he tried with all his might he could forget her; and it would be grotesque to kill himself on account of a vulgar slut. He had only one life, and it was madness to fling it away. He felt that he would never overcome his passion, but he knew that after all it was only a matter of time.</div>

<div class="line_en">Since he was grown up Philip had been given the best spare room at the vicarage. It was a corner-room and in front of one window was an old tree which blocked the view, but from the other you saw, beyond the garden and the vicarage field, broad meadows. Philip remembered the wall-paper from his earliest years. On the walls were quaint water colours of the early Victorian period by a friend of the Vicar's youth. They had a faded charm. The dressing-table was surrounded by stiff muslin. There was an old tall-boy to put your clothes in. Philip gave a sigh of pleasure; he had never realised that all those things meant anything to him at all. At the vicarage life went on as it had always done. No piece of furniture had been moved from one place to another; the Vicar ate the same things, said the same things, went for the same walk every day; he had grown a little fatter, a little more silent, a little more narrow. He had become accustomed to living without his wife and missed her very little. He bickered still with Josiah Graves. Philip went to see the churchwarden. He was a little thinner, a little whiter, a little more austere; he was autocratic still and still disapproved of candles on the altar. The shops had still a pleasant quaintness; and Philip stood in front of that in which things useful to seamen were sold, sea-boots and tarpaulins and tackle, and remembered that he had felt there in his childhood the thrill of the sea and the adventurous magic of the unknown.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="自从菲利普长大成人，牧师家最好的一间客房就留给他住了。这间房子在屋角上，其中一扇窗户前是棵挡住视线的老树，从其他窗户往外看，除了花园和教区的田地外，尽是广阔无际的草原。墙上贴的壁纸还是菲利普小时候的样子，挂着的几幅奇奇怪怪的、早期维多利亚风格的水彩画是出自牧师年轻时候认识的一个朋友之手。现在这些画颜色褪得极淡，别有一番魅力。梳妆台上铺着硬邦邦的平纹棉布，还有一个放衣服的旧式高衣橱。菲利普满意地长舒一口气，他之前从没发现这些东西对自己有什么意义可言。教区的生活每一天都是前一天的重复，连家具的位置都没有变动过。牧师吃的饭和以前一样，说的话和以前一样，散步的习惯也和以前一样。他只是身子胖了些、沉默了些、肚量更小了些。他已经习惯了没有妻子陪伴的生活，也鲜少会思念她。和乔西亚·格雷夫斯的拌嘴倒是照常不变。菲利普回来后也去拜访了这位教堂执事。他身子瘦了些、苍白了些，神色更严厉了些，还像以前一样特立独行、说一不二，还是坚决不同意往神坛上摆蜡烛。小镇上的商店依然是旧旧的样子，让人看一眼就心里喜欢。菲利普站在一家卖水手用具的商店门前，这里有水手靴、油布雨衣和船上用的轱辘、绳索。他记得小时候曾在这里的大海中感受过海水的颤栗和未知世界的惊险刺激。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He could not help his heart beating at each double knock of the postman in case there might be a letter from Mildred sent on by his landlady in London; but he knew that there would be none. Now that he could think it out more calmly he understood that in trying to force Mildred to love him he had been attempting the impossible. He did not know what it was that passed from a man to a woman, from a woman to a man, and made one of them a slave: it was convenient to call it the sexual instinct; but if it was no more than that, he did not understand why it should occasion so vehement an attraction to one person rather than another. It was irresistible: the mind could not battle with it; friendship, gratitude, interest, had no power beside it. Because he had not attracted Mildred sexually, nothing that he did had any effect upon her. The idea revolted him; it made human nature beastly; and he felt suddenly that the hearts of men were full of dark places. Because Mildred was indifferent to him he had thought her sexless; her anaemic appearance and thin lips, the body with its narrow hips and flat chest, the languor of her manner, carried out his supposition; and yet she was capable of sudden passions which made her willing to risk everything to gratify them. He had never understood her adventure with Emil Miller: it had seemed so unlike her, and she had never been able to explain it; but now that he had seen her with Griffiths he knew that just the same thing had happened then: she had been carried off her feet by an ungovernable desire. He tried to think out what those two men had which so strangely attracted her. They both had a vulgar facetiousness which tickled her simple sense of humour, and a certain coarseness of nature; but what took her perhaps was the blatant sexuality which was their most marked characteristic. She had a genteel refinement which shuddered at the facts of life, she looked upon the bodily functions as indecent, she had all sorts of euphemisms for common objects, she always chose an elaborate word as more becoming than a simple one: the brutality of these men was like a whip on her thin white shoulders, and she shuddered with voluptuous pain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邮差每每叩响大门，菲利普的心都怦怦地跳乱了节拍：说不定是伦敦的房东太太把米尔德里德给自己的信转寄过来了。可他心里清楚，根本不会有什么信。脑子冷静下来后，他终于能比较清醒地思考问题了。逼着米尔德里德爱上自己不亚于缘木求鱼，煎水作冰。男人到女人、女人到男人之间互相传递的究竟是一种怎样的化学物质，能让一方沦作另一方的奴隶？也许可以图省事儿，将它称作一种性欲的本能。可假设只是这样的话，那为什么会对某个人有强烈的冲动，而对另外的人毫无兴趣呢？这种情感是不可抵抗的，理智无法与之抗衡。友情、感激、利益在它面前都失去了效力。他既不能在性这方面吸引米尔德里德，所做的一切也就根本无法影响到她。这个念头令他作呕，令人之天性显得肮脏不堪；他忽然意识到男人的心里尽是阴暗面。米尔德里德对他冷若冰霜，他就以为她天生就是性冷淡，她贫血病弱的外表、薄薄的嘴唇、干瘦的身子、贫乳窄臀和没精打采的样子更证实了他的猜想。可忽然之间，她竟爆发出如此强烈的情欲，愿意为了春宵一夜而放弃所有。菲利普一直想不通她为什么会跟埃米尔·米勒鬼混在一起，这太不像她的作风了，她也根本不可能解释清楚。但现在看到她和格里菲斯的风流韵事，菲利普明白了这只是旧事重现：一股放纵难抑的欲望让她如醉如痴，神魂颠倒。她为什么会为这两个男人所吸引呢？他们天性猥琐粗鄙，都会说些恶俗肤浅的玩笑话来迎合她的低级趣味，可最能拿住她的恐怕还是他俩身上那种赤裸裸的、充满肉欲的魅力。她假装风雅斯文，削尖了脑袋想往上流社会挤，却无奈在现实生活中饱受打击，瑟瑟发抖。肉体的官能于她而言是肮脏而不体面的，普通的事物她也非要找个委婉的词儿来形容，似乎只有这样才能更贴切地表达语意。比如这两段风流情史要是让她自己来形容，就会这么说：那两个男人的残忍兽性犹如一根鞭子，抽打在她白嫩瘦弱的肩膀上，她因耽迷情欲而浑身抽搐。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One thing Philip had made up his mind about. He would not go back to the lodgings in which he had suffered. He wrote to his landlady and gave her notice. He wanted to have his own things about him. He determined to take unfurnished rooms: it would be pleasant and cheaper; and this was an urgent consideration, for during the last year and a half he had spent nearly seven hundred pounds. He must make up for it now by the most rigid economy. Now and then he thought of the future with panic; he had been a fool to spend so much money on Mildred; but he knew that if it were to come again he would act in the same way. It amused him sometimes to consider that his friends, because he had a face which did not express his feelings very vividly and a rather slow way of moving, looked upon him as strong-minded, deliberate, and cool. They thought him reasonable and praised his common sense; but he knew that his placid expression was no more than a mask, assumed unconsciously, which acted like the protective colouring of butterflies; and himself was astonished at the weakness of his will. It seemed to him that he was swayed by every light emotion, as though he were a leaf in the wind, and when passion seized him he was powerless. He had no self-control. He merely seemed to possess it because he was indifferent to many of the things which moved other people.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有一件事菲利普可以确定。他不会再回到伦敦的寓所了，因为在那里承受了太多的痛苦。他写信给房东太太通知退房，打算再租一间不带家具的房子，身边所有东西都要用自己的。这样不仅能让人心里愉快，还能更便宜一些。这样做实为应急之举。过去的这一年半里他花了将近七百镑，剩下的日子必须节衣缩食才能把这个大窟窿填上。有时一想起以后的日子，他就不由战战兢兢。他竟像个傻子一样在米尔德里德身上花了那么多钱。可他心里清楚，如果再让他重新选择一次，结果还是不会有任何改变。由于他天生表情不丰富，不太擅长把情绪生动地写在脸上，一举一动也慢吞吞的，所以朋友们总以为他是个意志坚定、深思熟虑、个性冷漠的人。这一切被他看在眼里，觉得特别滑稽。他们说他理智，夸他精通事理，可他知道自己波澜不惊的外表只是张不经意间戴起的面具罢了，就像蝴蝶的保护色。相反，他意志的软弱让自己都大吃一惊。每阵微小的情绪起伏都能让他摇摆不定，好似零落在风中的一片枯叶。每每激情涌来时，周身力气竟仿佛都被抽走了一般。他根本无法控制自己，只因为对别人趋之若鹜的事情表现得无动于衷，所以显得很有自制力罢了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He considered with some irony the philosophy which he had developed for himself, for it had not been of much use to him in the conjuncture he had passed through; and he wondered whether thought really helped a man in any of the critical affairs of life: it seemed to him rather that he was swayed by some power alien to and yet within himself, which urged him like that great wind of Hell which drove Paolo and Francesca ceaselessly on. He thought of what he was going to do and, when the time came to act, he was powerless in the grasp of instincts, emotions, he knew not what. He acted as though he were a machine driven by the two forces of his environment and his personality; his reason was someone looking on, observing the facts but powerless to interfere: it was like those gods of Epicurus, who saw the doings of men from their empyrean heights and had no might to alter one smallest particle of what occurred.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他想起自己研究出的哲学理论，感到讽刺至极。因为真到了关键时候，这套大道理却好像并没有起多大作用，也不知道思想是否真能在危急时刻给人提供帮助。在他看来，左右自己的力量似乎生根于内，又仿佛来自于外，就像驱赶着保罗和弗朗切斯科的地狱飓风。他想过将来应该怎么做，可不知为何，真等到需要行动了，反而在本能和情感的支配下败下阵来，活像一架由内外两股力量共同作用的机器。理智充其量只是个旁观者，事实鲜血淋漓地暴露在眼皮底下，他却无力干预：像伊壁鸠鲁所描述的诸神，踞于九天之上看着人们的所作所为，可对既成之事无分毫改变之力。">查看中文翻译</div>
