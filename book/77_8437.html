<div class="line_en">I don't respond to Oxana. I can't. I'm locked in to the events of the morning. Kris's sudden weightlessness as she is borne backward by the high-velocity sniper round, and the softness with which she falls to the marble floor. The sound of bullets smacking into clothing and flesh. The tiny blur of orange announcing the shot that furrows through my back, and the way that the sound seems to follow the pain. The sight of Dasha's men as we leave. One sprawled across the stairs, glued in place by his own congealed blood. Two others sitting on the half-landing, wounded but alive, and one of them, the one that Oxana struck on the head with her Sig Sauer, raising a rueful hand in farewell as we pass.</div>

<div class="line_en">At intervals I find myself weeping, or shaking uncontrollably. When this happens Oxana looks at me with frowning concern. She doesn't know what to say or do. At random moments she takes my hand, wipes my eyes with a tissue, or puts an arm around me and presses my head awkwardly to her shoulder. Lara pointedly ignores all of this.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We spend the rest of the day in the black Mercedes, traveling to Moscow. Anton drives, Richard is in the passenger seat, and Lara, Oxana and I are in the back. It's a perverse situation. My back hurts like hell, the slightest bump or vibration tearing at the stitches. Oxana gazes wordlessly out of the side window, Lara looks bored, and I sit between them, watching the flat, snow-blown landscape race past. Meanwhile, Oxana's Sig and my Glock are in Anton's pockets.</div>

<div class="line_en">Oxana takes my head in her hands, and gently turns it until we are face to face. "Listen to me," she says, very quietly, so that only I can hear. "I'm going to tell you a story. A story about my mother. Her name was Nadezhda, and she grew up on a farm, a few miles from the town of Novozybkov, although her family was originally from Chuvashia. She was very pretty, in the Chuvash way, with a high forehead and long dark hair. Something about her eyes, perhaps the arch of her brows, gave her a surprised expression. When she was fifteen there was the reactor meltdown at Chernobyl, a hundred and fifty kilometers away. The wind carried the radiation northeast to the Novozybkov district, and everyone from my mother's village was evacuated. Soon afterward the area became a Closed Zone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm not sure how my mother ended up in Perm. Perhaps she was sent to relatives. She married my father when she was twenty-two, and I was born a year later. I was a very clever child, and I'm not sure how, but I always knew that Mama was sick, and would die before long. I hated her for that, for forcing this sadness on me, and sometimes at night I dreamed that the waiting was over and she was already dead. She looked so helpless, so vulnerable, and that made me angry too, because I knew that was not how things were supposed to be. She was supposed to look after me. She was supposed to teach me all the things I needed to know.</div>

<div class="line_en">"There would often be whole days when she stayed in bed, and my father had to stay at home and make my meals. He was a military instructor, and he had no idea what to do with a little girl, so he taught me the things that he taught his men: how to fight and survive. My best memory with him is of going into the woods in the winter and trapping a rabbit. I must have been about six. He made me kill and skin the rabbit myself, and we cooked it on a fire in the snow. I was very proud of that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It wasn't long afterward that my mother said she was feeling better, and took me on a day trip to the Kungur ice caves. It was a special treat, partly because of the outing itself, but mostly because I was getting my mother to myself for a whole day. I even got a new coat to wear. It was pink quilted nylon, with a hood, and a zip down the front.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"We caught a bus from the Central station in Perm. The journey took about two hours, and we had lunch at a café in Kungur. Hamburger and chips, with Coca-Cola to drink, a big treat. I didn't know what to expect from the caves. I didn't know what a cave was, and ice didn't sound very interesting because we lived with it for half the year. So I wasn't prepared when we actually went down inside the earth. There was a paved stone track, and it was like going into some secret fairy-tale kingdom. There were ice crystals hanging from the ceiling like spears, shining ice pillars and waterfalls, and rock pools as clear as glass. Everything was lit up with colored lights. 'Is it magic?' I asked my mother, and she told me that it was. Later, when we were on the bus going home, I asked if the magic would make her better, and she said that maybe, just maybe, it would.</div>

<div class="line_en">"She died a few weeks later, and for years I wasn't quite sure if I'd imagined or dreamed the whole thing. It was all so unlike anything else in my life. All I knew was that magic might work for some people -- film stars, models, people like that -- but it didn't work for ordinary people like my family. I didn't cry when my mother died. I couldn't."</div>

<div class="line_en">We sit in silence as we wind through the suburbs. It's snowing again, and I listen to the soft thump of the windscreen wipers and the hiss of the slush beneath our wheels. The city's traffic is as chaotic as ever, and as we pass Moscow State University and cross the river, we're forced to slow to a crawl. The last few hundred meters take almost half an hour, but finally we pull up in front of a massive Stalinist block. Its gray frontage, pierced with archways, extends the length of the entire street.</div>

<div class="line_en">We follow Lara into a huge, dimly lit atrium from which passageways lead in multiple directions. There are marble pillars and classical details of the sort that you might find in an international railway station, but the overall effect is cheerless. A few people come and go, muffled against the winter weather, and no one seems perturbed by the fact that Lara is carrying a sniper's rifle and an automatic pistol. There's a shining trail of boot prints to the nearest lift, but Lara avoids this and leads us to a small alcove, and inputs a code into a wall panel. A door slides back, revealing a glass and steel lift, which whisks us with sickening speed to the twelfth floor.</div>

<div class="line_en">We climb out and stretch cramped limbs. The building's vast impersonality fills me with dread. Its towers are so tall that they vanish into the night sky. I'm standing next to Oxana, my back throbbing painfully, when there's a whooshing crunch in front of me, and glittering slivers spatter my face. Grabbing my arm, Oxana drags me beneath one of the archways.</div>

<div class="line_en">Lara touches a button beside the right-hand door and we are admitted by a young man in paramilitary uniform, who leads us along a corridor hung with abstract paintings in hues of ivory, scarlet and vermilion, their slashing brushstrokes so exactly like knife wounds that the stitches in my back start to ache. Several other men and women in business suits pass us in the corridor, before Lara lets Oxana into one of the rooms and pointedly leads me to another. It's painted dove gray, and undecorated except for a bronze statuette of a panther, which stands on a walnut side table.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We emerge into a softly illuminated space, neither hot nor cold, dominated by armored-glass windows and a huge Salvador Dalí painting of a tiger. There are doors to left and right, and a faintly ominous humming that might be the building's climate control system or distant machinery. Beyond the windows, far below, the dark form of the Moscow river winds between snowy parks and windblown embankments.</div>

<div class="line_en">The doctor arrives just ten minutes later. A businesslike young woman in the uniform of a Russian navy medic, with a case full of gear. She prods the stitches, feels my lymph nodes, and gives me a box of antibiotic tablets and another of painkillers. She doesn't ask me how I came by an obvious gunshot wound, but she's interested in the stitches. "Haven't seen that before. Blanket-stitch suturing. Nice neat work, though."</div>

<div class="line_en">"It was really nice. The father was only there at weekends; he was a Conservative MP with a red face who spent almost all of his time in London. He had a girlfriend there, some sort of prostitute I think, but his wife didn't mind because it meant that she could sit up all night watching Netflix. And Celia and Emma were so sweet. They used to take me out with them in the evening. We'd go to the local pub, get drunk, and then go dog-fighting."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes, they were a very traditional, upper-class family. The girls asked me if I had a boyfriend back in Russia, and obviously I said no. I explained that I worked in this quite macho world -- I was vague about what I actually did -- and I didn't think of myself as girly and feminine, and didn't like to be treated that way. So they said why didn't I change my pronouns, which was kind of funny since I was sent there to improve my English. So I did."</div>

<div class="line_en">The waiter announces the second course. My Russian vocabulary isn't wide when it comes to the larger mammals, but it's something like elk or reindeer. Something that once had antlers, and has now been reduced to dark, bloody steaks in a red berry sauce. Our glasses are exchanged for larger ones and charged with Georgian wine that's so easy to drink I need a refill almost immediately. On the other side of the table Oxana, animated by the morning's slaughter, is on sparkling form. She meets Richard's condescension with demure flirtatiousness, studiously ignores Anton, stares lasciviously at Lara, and shoots tender, soft-eyed glances at me. It's a performance, a chance to run through her repertoire of learned responses.</div>

<div class="line_en">When I was a teenager my parents had a cat, a beautiful, murderous creature called Violet, although Violent would have been a better name, who presented them daily with bloodied and dying voles, mice and small birds. I hated the sight of these heartbreaking little tributes, and begged my parents to put a bell on Violet, or give her more food at home, but they were having none of it. "It's just how cats are," they told me. "It's instinctive. She needs to hunt." Violet died as brutally as she'd lived, under the wheels of a speeding car at night, and looking back on the years she spent with us I think my parents not only tolerated their cat's savage ways, but were secretly gratified by them. Violet's behavior was in some sense authentic and enabled them to feel superior to city folk who preferred to avert their eyes from nature's darker realities. I understand my parents better now. Oxana, red in tooth and claw, is my Violet. She is how the world is, when you look at it without blinking, or flinching. She needs to hunt.</div>

<div class="line_en">Loosening his tie, Richard starts to talk. With an expansive sweep of his arm, he indicates the blazing expanse of the city. After the dilapidated grandeur of St. Petersburg, Moscow is fortress-like and monolithic. It's impressive, but too inhuman in scale to be beautiful. I feel myself swaying. Lara steadies me with a hand on my arm.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Everything that you see before you is dead or dying," Richard says. "Nothing works. There are no big political ideas, no great leaders, nothing to give people hope. I'm not just talking about Russia, but Russia is the perfect illustration of what I'm saying. Everything that people value, everything that once made them proud, belongs to the past. Communism was flawed as a system, but there was an ideal there, once upon a time. An aspiration. People understood that they were part of something, however imperfect. Now there is nothing. Nothing except the systematic looting of the nation's assets by a rapacious, self-appointed elite."</div>

<div class="line_en">His words have the sheen of frequent usage. He's spoken them before, perhaps many times. Oxana is listening with a slight frown on her face, Anton is expressionless, and Lara, who has let go of my arm, is examining their fingernails.</div>

<div class="line_en">"So what does the Twelve propose?" Richard continues, turning away from the window to face us. "What have all our plans and strategies been leading up to? A new world, nothing less. We put the corrupt old men out of their misery, and we rebuild."</div>

With one decisive action, we have to set the whole process in motion. And so I ask you all -- Villanelle, Eve, Lara, and of course you Anton, old friend -- are you with us? Are you ready to go down in history?"</div>

I read somewhere that Etonians learn a skill called "oiling," which is the art of courteously, but firmly, persuading others to your point of view. Richard is oiling us now, but his words are beginning to run together. I pull out my chair, and as I lower myself to the cushioned seat Oxana flicks an irritated glance at me. I'm not very drunk, but I feel heavy-limbed and uncoordinated. It's as much as I can do not to lie down under the dining table and close my eyes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But we can find it again, that golden age, because history is cyclic. All that is needed is a few good people. Men and women with the vision to see that the old must be destroyed to make way for the new, and the courage to do it."</div>

Oxana's snoring within a couple of minutes, her arms out-thrown, her mouth wide open, but I'm so tired that I can't sleep. The stitches don't help.

<div class="line_en">What have I agreed to? Is any one of us going to get out alive? From Richard's apocalyptic tone, and his talk of the danger of the mission, I would guess not. None of the foot soldiers, anyway. Richard himself, of course, is another matter. If one thing is certain it's that when the smoke clears he'll still be standing there, Old Etonian tie knotted, urbane smile in place.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It's weird. On the one hand I know that Richard's speech is brassy, echoing bullshit. That all this talk of golden ages and spiritual rebirth is just cover for what will undoubtedly turn out to be one more squalid political coup. On the other hand, there's something perversely thrilling about being locked into a conspiracy with Oxana. For all its horror, this is her world. I knew that when I abandoned my own. And was it really so ridiculous, Richard's talk of destruction and rebirth? Hadn't I done the same thing myself? Destroyed my old life to make way for my truer, darker self?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And yet I said yes. Whatever the project involves, it must surely include the murder of at least one prominent figure. It seems strange that Richard should want me to be part of the team. He probably just wants me on board to keep Oxana happy, or as a way of controlling her.</div>

We'll be measuring you up for clothes and equipment, and taking photographs for passports, et cetera. It's a tight turnaround, but our people are used to working against the clock. Your documents, clothes and hand luggage are being delivered in twenty-four hours. Your weaponry is waiting for you at the training destination."</div>

<div class="line_en">The day passes slowly and miserably. Oxana is unreachable, she won't even look at me. Instead she flirts listlessly with Charlie, making sure that I can see, and stares out the windows. With its stale, climate-controlled atmosphere, the apartment is oppressive. Everyone is on edge. The snow continues to fall all day, and although it's freezing on the streets I'd give anything to be out there, breathing the clean, cold air. Impossible, of course. We can't even open a window.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I listen with increasing disbelief. I agreed to be involved in whatever Richard and the Twelve are planning because of Oxana, and because I had no choice. I couldn't imagine Richard and Anton, knowing what they know about me, being so suicidally unwise as to award me any but the most minor, walk-on role. A couple of days on the range at Bullington doesn't add up to any kind of real training. I can fire, dismantle and clean a Service-issue Glock, but that's as far as it goes. I've spent my professional life behind a desk. I wear glasses. What part could I possibly play in an operation requiring "supreme daring and technical skill"? I'd be a liability, and it would be crazy to think otherwise. Yet Richard is clearly including me in this briefing.</div>

<div class="line_en">"You don't like anything about me," I say, swaying aggressively toward him and spilling a crimson splash of wine on the damask tablecloth. "You just need me because you need my girlfriend. Cheers."</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'm definitely looking forward to drinking a shitload of this stuff," I say, hearing my voice slur. "Assuming I make it back alive, that is."</div>

<div class="line_en">Dinner is once again superlative but I have no appetite, and the smell of rare meat and blood-thickened gravy turns my stomach. Instead, that evening, I drink the best part of a bottle of Château Pétrus, a wine so expensive that I never thought I'd taste it. Seeing me pouring my fifth glass, Richard looks at me indulgently. "Pétrus is the unofficial house wine of the Twelve," he says. "You're going to fit in perfectly."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh you will," he replies. "You're very hard to kill. It's one of the things I like most about you."</div>

<div class="line_en">He smiles. "But is she? Your girlfriend, I mean. She seems to be getting on very well with Lara, or whatever she's calling herself these days."</div>

<div class="line_en">I see what he means. On the other side of the table, Oxana is playing with Charlie's hand, holding their gaze and nipping their fingertips between her teeth.</div>

<div class="line_en">She follows me. More out of curiosity, I'm guessing, than anything else.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Slamming the bedroom door behind me I slap Oxana's face so hard that, for a moment, she's shocked into wide-eyed immobility. "Enough, OK? Enough of your stupid sulking, enough of this shit with Charlie, enough of you being such a complete and utter bitch."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Fuck you, Oxana. That's not good enough. You can't go through your life saying I am what I am and that's the end of it. You're worth more than that. We're worth more than that."</div>

<div class="line_en">My hand stings and it feels like the stitches in my back have torn open. Oxana recovers herself and flicks me a sly half-smile. "You knew what you were getting into with me. You knew better than anyone."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Really? Well perhaps I like how I am. Perhaps I don't want to be what you want me to be, has that thought ever crossed your mind?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Walking over to the window, I look down at the figures on the pavement below, braced against the driving snow. "Listen to me," I tell her. "The only reason I'm here, the only reason I'm even alive, is that Richard and Anton think that you care what happens to me. They need you, so they keep me around. But you know what? I think I'd rather tell them that they're wrong, that you don't actually give a shit about me. Then they can just put a bullet through the back of my head and get it over with. I've had enough."</div>

<div class="line_en">"We have one more night here. Two at the most. Then God knows what." I walk toward her, and place my hands on her arms. Her muscles twitch through her thin sweater, and her depthless gray eyes hold mine. I touch a finger to the ridge of scar tissue on her lip and hear the faint shiver of her breath. "Like you said, now's all there is. And you're all that I have and all that I want."</div>
