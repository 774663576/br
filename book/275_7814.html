<div class="line_en">Once upon a time there was a poor peasant by the name of Crab who drove two oxen with a load of wood into town where he sold it to a doctor for two thalers. He received his money just as the doctor was sitting down to eat. When the peasant saw how well the doctor ate and drank, his heart took a longing for the same things, and he decided that he would like to have been a doctor. He stood there for a while, and then asked if he too could not become a doctor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从前有一个贫穷的农夫名叫螃蟹，赶着两头牛拉了一车木头进城，以二个金币的价格将木头卖给了一个大夫。大夫一边给他点钱，一边坐在桌旁吃饭，农夫看见大夫的饭菜如此丰盛，从内心感到羨慕，心想如果自己也是大夫该多好。他站在那里楞了一会儿，终於不好意思地问他是否也能当一名大夫。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">First of all, buy yourself an ABC-book, one that has a picture of a rooster up front. Second, sell your wagon and your two oxen and buy yourself some clothing and other things that doctors use. Third, have yourself a sign painted with the words 'I am Doctor Know-All' and nail it above the door to your house."</div>

<div class="line_en">The peasant did everything he was told to do. After he had doctored a little -- but not very much -- some money was stolen from a great and wealthy nobleman. Someone told him about the Doctor Know-All who lived in such and such a village, and who must know where the money had gone. So the nobleman had his carriage hitched up, rode out to the village, and asked him if he were Doctor Know-All.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="农夫照此作好了一切，便开始行医治病。时间不长，有一个大财主的钱财被盗，听说在某某村庄有个万事通大夫，他想他一定知道被盗的钱财在哪里。於是大财主套上马车，驱车奔向那个村庄，问螃蟹是不是万事通大夫。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The servant grew very fearful and motioned to the doctor to go outside. There all four of them confessed to him that they had stolen the money. They offered to give it all to him and a handsome sum in addition, if he would not turn them in. Otherwise they would all hang. They showed him where the money was hidden. The doctor was satisfied with this, and he went back inside and sat down again at the table.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="看到这一切，仆人们的神色格外紧张，他们暗示大夫能不能出去一小会儿。於是他就出去了，四个仆人都坦白说是他们偷了钱，并且许诺如果他不揭发他们，他们愿意将钱还回而且给他一大笔钱作为酬谢，否则他们会被绞死。他们带他到了藏钱的地方。他胸有成竹地回到大厅，在桌旁落座后说道：">查看中文翻译</div>
