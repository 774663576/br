<div class="line_en">When the act of reflection takes place in the mind, when we look at ourselves in the light of thought, we discover that our life is embosomed in beauty. Behind us, as we go, all things assume pleasing forms, as clouds do far off. Not only things familiar and stale, but even the tragic and terrible, are comely, as they take their place in the pictures of memory. The river-bank, the weed at the water-side, the old house, the foolish person, -- however neglected in the passing, -- have a grace in the past. Even the corpse that has lain in the chambers has added a solemn ornament to the house. The soul will not know either deformity or pain. If, in the hours of clear reason, we should speak the severest truth, we should say, that we had never made a sacrifice. In these hours the mind seems so great, that nothing can be taken from us that seems much. All loss, all pain, is particular; the universe remains to the heart unhurt. Neither vexations nor calamities abate our trust. No man ever stated his griefs as lightly as he might. Allow for exaggeration in the most patient and sorely ridden hack that ever was driven. For it is only the finite that has wrought and suffered; the infinite lies stretched in smiling repose.</div>

<div class="line_en">The intellectual life may be kept clean and healthful, if man will live the life of nature, and not import into his mind difficulties which are none of his. No man need be perplexed in his speculations. Let him do and say what strictly belongs to him, and, though very ignorant of books, his nature shall not yield him any intellectual obstructions and doubts. Our young people are diseased with the theological problems of original sin, origin of evil, predestination, and the like. These never presented a practical difficulty to any man, -- never darkened across any man's road, who did not go out of his way to seek them. These are the soul's mumps, and measles, and whooping-coughs, and those who have not caught them cannot describe their health or prescribe the cure. A simple mind will not know these enemies. It is quite another thing that he should be able to give account of his faith, and expound to another the theory of his self-union and freedom. This requires rare gifts. Yet, without this self-knowledge, there may be a sylvan strength and integrity in that which he is. "A few strong instincts and a few plain rules" suffice us.</div>

<div class="line_en">My will never gave the images in my mind the rank they now take. The regular course of studies, the years of academical and professional education, have not yielded me better facts than some idle books under the bench at the Latin School. What we do not call education is more precious than that which we call so. We form no guess, at the time of receiving a thought, of its comparative value. And education often wastes its effort in attempts to thwart and balk this natural magnetism, which is sure to select what belongs to it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些思想疾病在我脑海中的地位，我还从来没有仔细想过。我在正规的学习课程中所了解的知识，还没有我在拉丁文学校的课桌下偷看闲书所了解得多。那些被我们认为是教育以外的东西，比我们所谓的教育更加珍贵。我们在接受一种新思想之初，不可能猜出它的比较价值。这种新思想具有强烈的吸引力，虽然教育试图减弱它的吸引力，却没有收到什么成效。因为，这种新思想总有办法找到属于它的东西。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In like manner, our moral nature is vitiated by any interference of our will. People represent virtue as a struggle, and take to themselves great airs upon their attainments, and the question is everywhere vexed, when a noble nature is commended, whether the man is not better who strives with temptation. But there is no merit in the matter. Either God is there, or he is not there. We love characters in proportion as they are impulsive and spontaneous. The less a man thinks or knows about his virtues, the better we like him. Timoleon's victories are the best victories; which ran and flowed like Homer's verses, Plutarch said. When we see a soul whose acts are all regal, graceful, and pleasant as roses, we must thank God that such things can be and are, and not turn sourly on the angel, and say, 'Crump is a better man with his grunting resistance to all his native devils.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="同样，由于我们的意志过分干涉我们的道德，所以我们的本性被弄得面目全非。人们说，美德就像一场战斗，争夺到战果的人会变得高傲甚至瞧不起任何人。如果一种高尚的天性大受称赞，人们就会产生这样一种疑惑——是不是能够抵抗诱惑的人更加厉害？可是，讨论这个问题没有任何意义。上帝到底存不存在？答案总是其中之一。我们尤其喜欢那些容易冲动和具有自发性的人。另外，我们还喜欢那些不经常考虑和试图了解自身德行的人。普鲁塔克说过，提摩勒翁式的胜利就像荷马史诗一样奔腾不息，是最伟大的胜利。如果我们看到一个人的灵魂像玫瑰一样高雅并能吸引人，我们就会感谢上帝，感谢他出人意料地创造出这种东西。可是，我们绝对不会跟天使翻脸，也不可能这么说：“由于科伦普老是暗自坚强地跟他那与生俱来的劣根性做斗争，所以他是一个出众的好人。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Not less conspicuous is the preponderance of nature over will in all practical life. There is less intention in history than we ascribe to it. We impute deep-laid, far-sighted plans to Caesar and Napoleon; but the best of their power was in nature, not in them. Men of an extraordinary success, in their honest moments, have always sung, 'Not unto us, not unto us.' According to the faith of their times, they have built altars to Fortune, or to Destiny, or to St. Julian. Their success lay in their parallelism to the course of thought, which found in them an unobstructed channel; and the wonders of which they were the visible conductors seemed to the eye their deed. Did the wires generate the galvanism? It is even true that there was less in them on which they could reflect, than in another; as the virtue of a pipe is to be smooth and hollow. That which externally seemed will and immovableness was willingness and self-annihilation. Could Shakspeare give a theory of Shakspeare? Could ever a man of prodigious mathematical genius convey to others any insight into his methods? If he could communicate that secret, it would instantly lose its exaggerated value, blending with the daylight and the vital energy the power to stand and to go.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在现实生活中，大家也对“本性胜过意志”这句话表示赞同。历史上的思想，其实并没有我们想的那么多。深谋远虑的计划是凯撒和拿破仑做出来的，可是它们的威力却没有体现在他们身上，而是体现在了大自然中。建立非凡业绩的人，会诚实地说：“我们不是造物主，不要把一切成就都归功于我们。”他们按照那个时代的信仰，建造了命运之神或者圣•尤利安的祭坛。他们的思想和行动是连贯的，因此他们走向了成功。在他们的身上，一切都畅行无阻，不会受到任何杂念的干扰。他们就像连通自然和奇迹的导体，奇迹是通过他们才呈现在世人面前的，因此有很多人都认为他们创造了奇迹。莫非电线里凭空出现了电流？他们确实比别人顾虑得更少，就如同管子是要光滑、通畅一样。那些表面上不屈不挠的事物，事实上却是在舍生取义地自我毁灭。莎士比亚不会向世人提出自己的文艺理论，一个数学奇才也无法把他的想法分毫不差地传给他人。因为，这些东西都是秘密，如果被他们自己讲出来，它就不那么珍贵了，因为它把人类直立行走的能力、生命力等事物与阳光联系在了一起，使人与自然融为一体，而这一点是人类无法接受的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The face of external nature teaches the same lesson. Nature will not have us fret and fume. She does not like our benevolence or our learning much better than she likes our frauds and wars.

<div class="line_en">The lesson is forcibly taught by these observations, that our life might be much easier and simpler than we make it; that the world might be a happier place than it is; that there is no need of struggles, convulsions, and despairs, of the wringing of the hands and the gnashing of the teeth; that we miscreate our own evils. We interfere with the optimism of nature; for, whenever we get this vantage-ground of the past, or of a wiser mind in the present, we are able to discern that we are begirt with laws which execute themselves.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些现象让我们了解到：跟我们所要创造的生活相比，我们的现实生活其实可以很简单。生活在那个世界里，也许会比生活在现在这个世界更快乐，因为那里没有争斗、叛乱、绝望，也没有咬牙切齿。我们现在的世界里充满了邪恶，可它却是我们自己错误地创造出来的。乐观的本性，被我们自己给毒害了。因为，无论过去我们处于何种优势之中，也不管我们现在有多么聪慧，其实我们都已经被困在了自己设置的迷城之中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We are full of mechanical actions. We must needs intermeddle, and have things in our own way, until the sacrifices and virtues of society are odious. Love should make joy; but our benevolence is unhappy. Our Sunday-schools, and churches, and pauper-societies are yokes to the neck. We pain ourselves to please nobody. There are natural ways of arriving at the same ends at which these aim, but do not arrive. Why should all virtue work in one and the same way? Why should all give dollars? It is very inconvenient to us country folk, and we do not think any good will come of it. We have not dollars; merchants have; let them give them. Farmers will give corn; poets will sing; women will sew; laborers will lend a hand; the children will bring flowers. And why drag this dead weight of a Sunday-school over the whole Christendom? It is natural and beautiful that childhood should inquire, and maturity should teach; but it is time enough to answer questions when they are asked. Do not shut up the young people against their will in a pew, and force the children to ask them questions for an hour against their will.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="机械的运作遍布在我们周围。我们老想违背自然法则，进而把事物控制在我们手中。要是这样发展下去，甚至连社会的道德和传统都会腐败不堪。爱应该带来欢乐，可是我们的仁慈却让爱也变得不甜美了。我们的主日学校、教会和慈善机构，都像枷锁一样束缚着我们。我们的苦难无法让旁人得到快乐。这些有着明确目的的行为，我们很难做到，可是有些自然的手段却可以做到。有些事情只能用一种办法才能解决，所以有些人会为了解决这类事情而牺牲所有的德行，他们为什么会这样呢？为什么大家都要掏腰包？看看我们国家人民的生活状况，大多数人的生活都很贫苦，付不起钱。如果非要让大家都勉为其难地掏腰包，最终会弄得什么事都办不好。我们没钱，要钱就去找富有的商人。至于其他人，就让他们做他们力所能及的事：农民贡献粮食，诗人写诗，妇人缝补，劳工干体力活，孩子们可以给获得荣誉的人献花…基督徒不应该分摊主日学校的负担，因为这么做是不合理的。一个人在小时候勤学好问，长大后做了老师，这是合情合理的事情。这时，如果有人提出疑问，他就应该回答。可是，如果把他困在教师岗位上，并且强迫孩子们向他提问，一个小时之后才结束，就不应该了。">查看中文翻译</div>

Our society is encumbered by ponderous machinery, which resembles the endless aqueducts which the Romans built over hill and dale, and which are superseded by the discovery of the law that water rises to the level of its source. It is a Chinese wall which any nimble Tartar can leap over. It is a standing army, not so good as a peace.

<div class="line_en">The simplicity of the universe is very different from the simplicity of a machine. He who sees moral nature out and out, and thoroughly knows how knowledge is acquired and character formed, is a pedant. The simplicity of nature is not that which may easily be read, but is inexhaustible. The last analysis can no wise be made. We judge of a man's wisdom by his hope, knowing that the perception of the inexhaustibleness of nature is an immortal youth. The wild fertility of nature is felt in comparing our rigid names and reputations with our fluid consciousness. We pass in the world for sects and schools, for erudition and piety, and we are all the time jejune babes. One sees very well how Pyrrhonism grew up. Every man sees that he is that middle point, whereof every thing may be affirmed and denied with equal reason. He is old, he is young, he is very wise, he is altogether ignorant. He hears and feels what you say of the seraphim, and of the tin-pedler. There is no permanent wise man, except in the figment of the Stoics. We side with the hero, as we read or paint, against the coward and the robber; but we have been ourselves that coward and robber, and shall be again, not in the low circumstance, but in comparison with the grandeurs possible to the soul.</div>

<div class="line_en">A little consideration of what takes place around us every day would show us, that a higher law than that of our will regulates events; that our painful labors are unnecessary, and fruitless; that only in our easy, simple, spontaneous action are we strong, and by contenting ourselves with obedience we become divine. Belief and love, -- a believing love will relieve us of a vast load of care. O my brothers, God exists. There is a soul at the centre of nature, and over the will of every man, so that none of us can wrong the universe. It has so infused its strong enchantment into nature, that we prosper when we accept its advice, and when we struggle to wound its creatures, our hands are glued to our sides, or they beat our own breasts. The whole course of things goes to teach us faith. We need only obey. There is guidance for each of us, and by lowly listening we shall hear the right word. Why need you choose so painfully your place, and occupation, and associates, and modes of action, and of entertainment? Certainly there is a possible right for you that precludes the need of balance and wilful election. For you there is a reality, a fit place and congenial duties. Place yourself in the middle of the stream of power and wisdom which animates all whom it floats, and you are without effort impelled to truth, to right, and a perfect contentment. Then you put all gainsayers in the wrong. Then you are the world, the measure of right, of truth, of beauty. If we will not be mar-plots with our miserable interferences, the work, the society, letters, arts, science, religion of men would go on far better than now, and the heaven predicted from the beginning of the world, and still predicted from the bottom of the heart, would organize itself, as do now the rose, and the air, and the sun.</div>

He has faculties silently inviting him thither to endless exertion. He is like a ship in a river; he runs against obstructions on every side but one; on that side all obstruction is taken away, and he sweeps serenely over a deepening channel into an infinite sea. This talent and this call depend on his organization, or the mode in which the general soul incarnates itself in him. He inclines to do something which is easy to him, and good when it is done, but which no other man can do. He has no rival. For the more truly he consults his own powers, the more difference will his work exhibit from the work of any other. His ambition is exactly proportioned to his powers. The height of the pinnacle is determined by the breadth of the base. Every man has this call of the power to do somewhat unique, and no man has any other call. The pretence that he has another call, a summons by name and personal election and outward "signs that mark him extraordinary, and not in the roll of common men," is fanaticism, and betrays obtuseness to perceive that there is one mind in all the individuals, and no respect of persons therein.</div>

But that which I call right or goodness is the choice of my constitution; and that which I call heaven, and inwardly aspire after, is the state or circumstance desirable to my constitution; and the action which I in all my years tend to do, is the work for my faculties.

<div class="line_en">By doing his work, he makes the need felt which he can supply, and creates the taste by which he is enjoyed. By doing his own work, he unfolds himself. It is the vice of our public speaking that it has not abandonment. Somewhere, not only every orator but every man should let out all the length of all the reins; should find or make a frank and hearty expression of what force and meaning is in him. The common experience is, that the man fits himself as well as he can to the customary details of that work or trade he falls into, and tends it as a dog turns a spit. Then is he a part of the machine he moves; the man is lost. Until he can manage to communicate himself to others in his full stature and proportion, he does not yet find his vocation. He must find in that an outlet for his character, so that he may justify his work to their eyes. If the labor is mean, let him by his thinking and character make it liberal. Whatever he knows and thinks, whatever in his apprehension is worth doing, that let him communicate, or men will never know and honor him aright. Foolish, whenever you take the meanness and formality of that thing you do, instead of converting it into the obedient spiracle of your character and aims.</div>

Those facts, words, persons, which dwell in his memory without his being able to say why, remain, because they have a relation to him not less real for being as yet unapprehended.

To the thoughts of that state of mind he has a right. All the secrets of that state of mind he can compel. This is a law which statesmen use in practice.

But Napoleon sent to Vienna M. de Narbonne, one of the old noblesse, with the morals, manners, and name of that interest, saying, that it was indispensable to send to the old aristocracy of Europe men of the same connection, which, in fact, constitutes a sort of free-masonry.

<div class="line_en">The effect of any writing on the public mind is mathematically measurable by its depth of thought. How much water does it draw? If it awaken you to think, if it lift you from your feet with the great voice of eloquence, then the effect is to be wide, slow, permanent, over the minds of men; if the pages instruct you not, they will die like flies in the hour. The way to speak and write what shall not go out of fashion is, to speak and write sincerely. The argument which has not power to reach my own practice, I may well doubt, will fail to reach yours. But take Sidney's maxim:-- "Look in thy heart, and write." He that writes to himself writes to an eternal public. That statement only is fit to be made public, which you have come at in attempting to satisfy your own curiosity. The writer who takes his subject from his ear, and not from his heart, should know that he has lost as much as he seems to have gained, and when the empty book has gathered all its praise, and half the people say, 'What poetry! what genius!' it still needs fuel to make fire. That only profits which is profitable. Life alone can impart life; and though we should burst, we can only be valued as we make ourselves valuable. There is no luck in literary reputation. They who make up the final verdict upon every book are not the partial and noisy readers of the hour when it appears; but a court as of angels, a public not to be bribed, not to be entreated, and not to be overawed, decides upon every man's title to fame. Only those books come down which deserve to last. Gilt edges, vellum, and morocco, and presentation-copies to all the libraries, will not preserve a book in circulation beyond its intrinsic date. It must go with all Walpole's Noble and Royal Authors to its fate. Blackmore, Kotzebue, or Pollok may endure for a night, but Moses and Homer stand for ever. There are not in the world at any one time more than a dozen persons who read and understand Plato:-- never enough to pay for an edition of his works; yet to every generation these come duly down, for the sake of those few persons, as if God brought them in his hand. "No book," said Bentley, "was ever written down by any but itself." The permanence of all books is fixed by no effort friendly or hostile, but by their own specific gravity, or the intrinsic importance of their contents to the constant mind of man. "Do not trouble yourself too much about the light on your statue," said Michel Angelo to the young sculptor; "the light of the public square will test its value."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们要衡量一部作品的思想深度，只需要知道它对人们的心灵造成多大的影响就可以了。如果它唤醒了你沉睡的思想，用强大的力量帮助你提升认识，那么它就会给人们的心灵带来宽大、舒适、持久的影响；如果它对你毫无启发，它则会慢慢地消失。真诚地去讲、去写，是让你所表达的思想永不过时的不二法门。无法影响我们自己的观点，自然也不具备影响他人的力量。西德尼有一句格言：“窥视你的心，然后才动笔。”这个忠告我们还是听一下比较好。我们在为自己写作时，其实也是在为众多读者写作。只有让你自己感到满意的言词，才有资格让大众知道。只是用耳朵听取材料，而不倾听自己心声的作家，他所获得的东西，与他失去的东西一样多。即使他那本内容空泛的书把所有的溢美之词都搜集齐全，并且被半数的人赞誉为“动人的诗歌，伟大天才的作品”，它仍然需要燃料才能烧旺。使人获益的一定是有益的东西。只有生命才能创造生命。我们单是充分表现自己是不够的，还需要使我们自身具有价值，这样才能受到重视。光靠运气是不能在文学上获得地位的。决定一本书归宿的，不是它刚问世时那些观点偏颇、大力吹捧它的读者，而是一个不受利害和权力影响的法庭，即全体读者。作者能不能成名，是由全体读者决定的。只有拥有永恒价值的书，才会流传后世。至于烫金边、包羔皮纸或摩洛哥皮等华丽的包装，以及给各地图书馆送赠本等，都不会延长一本书的流通日期。最后，它们会像华尔普尔的“作家老爷们”的作品一样，随着作者一起消亡。布莱克默、柯策布或波洛克只能闻名一时，而摩西和荷马却能够永世长存。不管是哪个时代，能看懂柏拉图著作的人都不过十来个，这些人根本没有资本去再次印刷他的著作。可是，他的著作还是流传了下来，好像上帝为了这几个人亲自动手再印了似的。宾利说：“写书的不是别人，而是书本身。”决定一部作品是否能够永世流传的，不是人们的好恶，而是作品本身。如果一本书的内容对人们的内心起到重要作用，它就有可能流传后世。米开朗基罗曾经这样告诫年轻的雕刻家：“别费心地关注你的雕像上的光芒。它的价值，是由公众的目光决定的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

This is that law whereby a work of art, of whatever kind, sets us in the same state of mind wherein the artist was when he made it. That which we do not believe, we cannot adequately say, though we may repeat the words never so often.

If a man know that he can do any thing, -- that he can do it better than any one else, -- he has a pledge of the acknowledgment of that fact by all persons. The world is full of judgment-days, and into every assembly that a man enters, in every action he attempts, he is gauged and stamped.

'What has he done?' is the divine question which searches men, and transpierces every false reputation.

<div class="line_en">This over-estimate of the possibilities of Paul and Pericles, this under-estimate of our own, comes from a neglect of the fact of an identical nature. Bonaparte knew but one merit, and rewarded in one and the same way the good soldier, the good astronomer, the good poet, the good player. The poet uses the names of Caesar, of Tamerlane, of Bonduca, of Belisarius; the painter uses the conventional story of the Virgin Mary, of Paul, of Peter. He does not, therefore, defer to the nature of these accidental men, of these stock heroes. If the poet write a true drama, then he is Caesar, and not the player of Caesar; then the selfsame strain of thought, emotion as pure, wit as subtle, motions as swift, mounting, extravagant, and a heart as great, self-sufficing, dauntless, which on the waves of its love and hope can uplift all that is reckoned solid and precious in the world, -- palaces, gardens, money, navies, kingdoms, -- marking its own incomparable worth by the slight it casts on these gauds of men, -- these all are his, and by the power of these he rouses the nations. Let a man believe in God, and not in names and places and persons. Let the great soul incarnated in some woman's form, poor and sad and single, in some Dolly or Joan, go out to service, and sweep chambers and scour floors, and its effulgent daybeams cannot be muffled or hid, but to sweep and scour will instantly appear supreme and beautiful actions, the top and radiance of human life, and all people will get mops and brooms; until, lo! suddenly the great soul has enshrined itself in some other form, and done some other deed, and that is now the flower and head of all living nature.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="由于我们忽略了事实的性质本来就是相同的，所以我们对保罗和伯里克利的期待过高，对自己却期待很低。拿破仑只会用同一种方法犒劳优秀的战士、诗人、星相师、演员等，那是他所知道的唯一一种奖励功勋的办法。诗人们在表达自己的意见时，喜欢提起凯撒、帖木儿、卜杜加、贝利萨留；画家在谈话时，喜欢讲圣母玛利亚、保罗和彼得等人的传统故事。由此可见，他们并不尊敬那些次要人物或普通英雄的天性。诗人如果能够写出一部戏剧，那他就成了第二个恺撒，而不是扮演恺撒的人。这时，人们就可以拥有恺撒那样坚定的思想、纯真的情感、聪明的智慧，并像凯撒那样做出快速、昂扬、大胆的动作，以伟大、自信、无惧的心，把宫殿、花园、财富、舰队、国家等一切被世人认为既牢固又宝贵的东西推到爱与希望的浪尖上，以此传达人们对这些浮华的轻蔑之情，表明人们自身具有至高无上的价值。上述的一切成就，都是他借助外力实现的，他唤醒了世界各国人民的意识。让人们只信仰上帝吧，不要信仰名义或权贵。伟大的灵魂可能存在于一个集贫穷、哀伤、孤独于一身的女人身上，甚至让她化身为一个名叫朵莉或琼的女佣，令她整天给人打扫房间。可是，这些平庸的工作并不能遮掩她耀眼的光芒，也无法阻止她做出高尚的行为。最后，她终将到达人生的顶峰，身上闪烁着耀眼的光芒。这么一来，可能所有的人都会努力工作，以致世上突然多出许多伟大的灵魂。这些伟大的灵魂把自己置身于不同的工作环境中，最后做出不同的成就，成为大自然的活的灵魂。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I may say it of our preposterous use of books, -- He knew not what to do, and so he read. I can think of nothing to fill my time with, and I find the Life of Brant. It is a very extravagant compliment to pay to Brant, or to General Schuyler, or to General Washington. My time should be as good as their time, -- my facts, my net of relations, as good as theirs, or either of theirs. Rather let me do my work so well that other idlers, if they choose, may compare my texture with the texture of these and find it identical with the best.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这样的形容，也适用于我们对书籍的错误使用。可以这么说吧，“他不知道该干什么，只好读书。”我不知道该如何打发时间，只好拿出《布兰特传》。在这本书中，有对布兰特、斯凯勒将军或华盛顿将军的过分恭维。他们拥有美好的时光、社交圈，我也应当拥有，即便是拥有其中的任何一个人的经历也可以。还是应该把自己该做的事做好，如此一来，那些游手好闲的人就可以拿我与这些人进行比较，并发现我的行为与其中的佼佼者是一样的。">查看中文翻译</div>
