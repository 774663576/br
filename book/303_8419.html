<div class="line_en">If I had to choose between physical and verbal abuse, I'd take a beating anytime. You can see the marks, so at least people feel sorry for you. With the verbal stuff, it just makes you crazy. The wounds are invisible. Nobody cares. Real bruises heal a hell of a lot faster than insults.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Remember the old saying, "Sticks and stones may break my bones, but words can never hurt me"? It's not true. Insulting names, degrading comments, and belittling criticism can give children extremely negative messages about themselves, messages that can have dramatic effects on their future well-being. As one caller to my radio show put it:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As a society, we have traditionally considered the discipline of children a private matter, to be handled within the family, usually at the father's discretion. Today, many civic authorities have come to recognize the need for new procedures to deal with widespread physical and sexual child abuse. But even the most concerned authorities can do nothing for the verbally abused child. He is all alone.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Power of Cruel Words</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Most parents will occasionally say something derogatory to their children. This is not necessarily verbal abuse. But it is abusive to launch frequent verbal attacks on a child's appearance, intelligence, competence, or value as a human being.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Other verbal abusers are more indirect, assailing the child with a constant barrage of teasing, sarcasm, insulting nicknames, and subtle put-downs. These parents often hide their abuse behind the facade of humor. They make little jokes like, "The last time I saw a nose that big was on Mount Rushmore," or, "That's a good-looking jacket -- for a clown," or, "You must have been home sick the day they passed out brains."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Like controlling parents, verbal abusers have two distinct styles. There are those who attack directly, openly, viciously degrading their children. They may call their children stupid, worthless, or ugly. They may say that they wish their child had never been born. They are oblivious to their child's feelings and to the long-term effects of their constant assaults on their child's developing self-image.</div>

<div class="line_en">I just can't go on this way. I'm practically fifty and I'm super-sensitive to almost everything that anybody says to me. I can't take anything at face value. I always think someone's making fun of me. I think my wife's making fun of me… I think my patients make fun of me. I lie awake at night thinking about what people said to me during the day… and I keep reading bad things into everything. Sometimes I think I'm going crazy.</div>

<div class="line_en">Phil, 48, had the outward appearance of a confident man. He was a tall, rugged-looking dentist with a taste for stylish clothes. But when he spoke, his voice was so quiet that I had trouble hearing him. I had to ask him several times to repeat himself. He explained that he was seeking help for his painful shyness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Phil talked openly about his current life, but he closed up when I asked him about his early years. With some gentle probing, he told me that what he remembered most vividly about his childhood was his father's constant teasing. The jokes were always at Phil's expense and he often felt humiliated. When the rest of the family laughed, he felt all the more isolated.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">If the child, or any other family member, complains, the abuser invariably accuses him or her of lacking a sense of humor. "She knows I'm only kidding," he'll say, as if the victim of his abuse were a co-conspirator.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was bad enough being teased, but sometimes he really scared me when he'd say things like: "This boy can't be a son of ours, look at that face. I'll bet they switched babies on us in the hospital. Why don't we take him back and swap him for the right one." I was only six, and I really thought I was going to get dropped off at the hospital. One day, I finally said to him, "Dad, why are you always picking on me?" He said, "I'm not picking on you. I'm just joking around. Can't you see that?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Phil, like any young child, couldn't distinguish the truth from a joke, a threat from a tease. Positive humor is one of our most valuable tools for strengthening family bonds. But humor that belittles can be extremely damaging within the family. Children take sarcasm and humorous exaggeration at face value. They are not worldly enough to understand that a parent is joking when he says something like, "We're going to have to send you to preschool in China." Instead, the child may have nightmares about being abandoned in some frightening, distant land.</div>

<div class="line_en">Phil was constantly being humiliated and picked on. When he made an attempt to confront his father's behavior, he was accused of being inadequate because he "couldn't take a joke." Phil had nowhere to go with all these feelings.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We have all been guilty of making jokes at someone else's expense. Most of the time, such jokes can be relatively harmless. But, as in other forms of toxic parenting, it is the frequency, the cruelty, and the source of these jokes that make them abusive. Children believe and internalize what their parents say about them. It is sadistic and destructive for a parent to make repetitive jokes at the expense of a vulnerable child.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As Phil described his feelings, I could see that he was still embarrassed -- as if he believed that his complaints were silly. I reassured him by saying, "I understand how humiliating your father's jokes were. They hurt you terribly, yet no one took your pain seriously. But we're here to get to the bottom of your pain, not to discount it. You're safe here, Phil. No one's going to put you down."</div>

<div class="line_en">When Phil first came in for treatment, he made absolutely no connection between his hypersensitivity and his father's taunting. As a little boy, Phil was unprotected because his father's behavior was never recognized as abuse. Phil was in a typical "lose-lose" situation: "My dad's jokes hurt me and I'm weak because I can't take it."</div>

<div class="line_en">Little Phil was the butt of his father's jokes and struggled to hide his feelings of inadequacy. Adult Phil was no different, but he moved in a much larger world, so he transferred his fears and negative expectations to other people. Phil went through life with his nerve ends exposed, expecting to be hurt, to be humiliated. His hypersensitivity, his shyness, and his distrust of others was an inevitable but ineffective way of attempting to protect himself against further hurt.</div>

<div class="line_en">Many parents dish out their verbal abuse under the guise of guidance. To justify cruel and denigrating remarks, they use rationalizations such as, "I'm trying to help you become a better person," or, "It's a tough world and we're teaching you to take it." Because this abuse wears the protective mask of education, it is especially difficult for the adult child to acknowledge its destructiveness.</div>

I haven't been in school in ten years. I don't know if I can do it. And I don't know if I'm up to an M. B. A. anyway. Even people close to me say that I'm getting in over my head.</div>

She meant well, she really did. She'd imitate me if I mispronounced a word. She'd make fun of how I looked… ballet recitals were the worst. Mom had dreams of being a dancer herself, but she got married instead. So I guess I was supposed to live out her dream for her, but I never danced as well as she could, at least that's what she always told me. I'll never forget one recital when I was about twelve. I thought I'd done pretty well, but my mom came backstage and said -- in front of the whole class --"You danced like a hippo." I just wanted to sink through the floor. When I sulked all the way home, she told me I should learn to take a little criticism because that's the only way I was going to learn. Then she patted my arm, and I thought she was going to say something nice, but you know what she said? "Let's face it, dear, you don't do anything very well, do you?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Vicki's mother seems to have been strongly invested in making her young daughter feel inadequate. She did so through a series of confusing double messages. On one hand, she urged her daughter to excel, while on the other hand she told her how terrible she was. Vicki always felt off balance, never sure whether she was doing anything right. When she thought she'd done well, her mother deflated her; when she thought she'd done poorly, her mother told her she couldn't do any better. At a time when Vicki should have been building self-confidence, her mother was knocking it down. All in the name of making Vicki a better person.</div>

<div class="line_en">But what was this abusive parent really doing? Vicki's mother was fighting her own feelings of inadequacy. Her own dance career was thwarted, perhaps by marriage. But perhaps she used marriage as an excuse because she didn't have the confidence to pursue a career. By establishing her superiority over her daughter, Vicki's mother could deny her feelings of inadequacy. Any occasion became fair game, even if it involved humiliating her daughter in front of her peers. It is particularly scarring for a budding adolescent to be embarrassed in this way, but the toxic parent's needs always come first.</div>

<div class="line_en">During adolescence, little girls start to become women and little boys start to become men. The child's adolescence is an especially threatening time for the insecure parent. Women feel frightened that they're growing old and losing their beauty. They may see their daughters as competitors and feel the need to belittle them, especially in front of their husbands. Men may feel a threat to their virility and power. There's room for only one man in the house, so they use ridicule and humiliation to keep their sons feeling little and helpless. Many adolescents exacerbate the situation by being openly competitive as a means of testing the waters of adulthood.</div>

<div class="line_en">The need to make someone feel inadequate in order to feel adequate oneself rapidly evolves into out-and-out competition. Clearly, Vicki's mother came to see her young daughter as a threat because as Vicki grew older and became more beautiful, more mature, and more competent, her mother had more trouble feeling superior. She had to keep up the pressure, keep on demeaning her daughter, to defend against this threat.</div>

<div class="line_en">Healthy parents experience their children's growing competence with excitement and joy. Competitive parents, on the other hand, often feel deprived, anxious, even scared. Most competitive parents are not aware of the reasons for these feelings, but they know that the child stirs them up.</div>

<div class="line_en">Competitive parents have often been victims of deprivation in their own childhoods, whether from shortages of food, clothing, or love. No matter how much they have, they still live in fear of not having enough. Many of these parents reenact with their children the competition they experienced with their own parents or siblings. This unfair competition puts enormous pressure on a child.</div>

<div class="line_en">Despite what competitive parents may claim to want for their children, their hidden agenda is to ensure that their children can't outdo them. The unconscious messages are powerful: "You cannot be more successful than I am,"</div>

<div class="line_en">Because these messages are so deeply entrenched, if the adult children of competitive parents do manage to excel in something, they often experience tremendous guilt. The more they succeed, the more miserable they become. This often leads them to sabotage their success. For these adult children of toxic parents, under-achievement is the price of peace of mind. They control their guilt by unconsciously limiting themselves so they don't outperform their parents. In a sense, they fulfill their parents' negative prophecies.</div>

It is very common for fathers to react to their daughters' blossoming sexuality with discomfort and often hostility.

It is as if he were saying, "You are a bad and wicked person because you make me feel bad and wicked things for you."</div>

<div class="line_en">During the emotional maelstrom of adolescence, Carol desperately needed a loving and supportive father to give her confidence. Instead, he subjected her to relentless denigration. Her father's verbal abuse, combined with her mother's passivity, severely damaged Carol's ability to believe in herself as a valuable and lovable person. When people told her how pretty she was, all she could think about was whether they could smell her. No amount of external validation could compete with her father's devastating messages.</div>

<div class="line_en">I started modeling when I was seventeen. Of course, the more successful I was, the worse my father got. I really had to get out of that house. So, I got married at nineteen to the first guy who asked me. A real doll: he hit me when I was pregnant and he left me when the baby was born. Naturally, I blamed myself. I figured I must have done something wrong. Maybe I smelled bad, I didn't know. About a year later, I married a guy who didn't beat me, but he hardly ever talked to me. I stuck that one out for ten years because I couldn't face my parents with another failed marriage. But I finally left him. Thank God I had my modeling, so I was able to support my son and myself. I even swore off men for a few years. Then I met Glen. I thought this was it; I'd somehow found the perfect guy. The first five years of our marriage was the happiest time of my life. Then I found out he'd been cheating on me almost from the day we got married. I did a lot of forgiving over the next ten years because I just didn't want to lose another marriage. Last year he left me for a woman half my age. Why can't I do anything right?</div>

<div class="line_en">I explained to Carol that by asking her father, or the men she chose to replace him, to make her feel okay about herself, she was putting her self-esteem in their hands. It didn't take a genius to see how destructive those hands had been. She had to take back control of her self-esteem by confronting the self-defeating beliefs that her father had planted in her childhood. Over the next few months she gradually came to realize that her self-esteem was not lost -- she was just looking for it in the wrong place.</div>

<div class="line_en">I reminded Carol that she had done a lot right: she'd been a loving and available mother; she'd raised a son who was doing well in his own life; she had two successful careers. But none of my assurances carried much weight. Carol had internalized her father's image of herself as a worthless, repulsive human being. As a result, most of her adult life was propelled by a self-defeating quest for the love she had craved from her father as a young girl. She chose cruel, abusive, or distant men -- like her father -- and tried to get them to love her the way her father never had.</div>

<div class="line_en">Perfectionist Parents</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The impossible expectation that children be perfect is another common trigger for severe verbal attacks. Many verbally abusive parents are themselves high achievers, but all too often their homes become dumping grounds for career stress. (Alcoholic parents may also make impossible demands on their children, then use their children's failure to justify drinking.)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Perfectionist parents seem to operate under the illusion that if they can just get their children to be perfect, they will be a perfect family. They put the burden of stability on the child to avoid facing the fact that they, as parents, cannot provide it. The child fails and becomes the scapegoat for family problems. Once again, the child is saddled with the blame.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Children need to make mistakes and discover that it's not the end of the world. That's how they gain the confidence to try new things in life. Toxic parents impose unobtainable goals, impossible expectations, and ever-changing rules on their children. They expect their children to respond with a degree of maturity that can come only from life experiences that are inaccessible to a child. Children are not miniature adults, but toxic parents expect them to act as if they are.</div>

If he told us to jump off a cliff, we had to jump. No questions. I got it a lot worse than my sister did. He was on my case all the time, mostly about my room. He would do this goddamned inspection every day like it was some kind of army barracks. When you're nine or ten, things are always a little messy, but he didn't care. Everything had to be perfect, nothing could be out-of-place. If I left a book on the desk, he'd start screaming about how I was a disgusting pig. He'd call me a fucking little asshole or a little son of a bitch or a snot-nosed bastard. It was like his favorite sport to keep pounding me with those lousy names. He never hit me, but the goddamned names hurt just as bad.</div>

<div class="line_en">When my stepfather was young, he was the smallest kid in the school. Everybody picked on him. By the time my mother met him, he was husky because he'd gotten into working out.

<div class="line_en">Somewhere inside Paul's stepfather, a small, frightened, inadequate boy was still alive. And since Paul had so many similar characteristics, he became a symbol of his stepfather's own painful childhood. Because his stepfather had never accepted himself as a child, he felt immediate rage at the young boy who reminded him of himself. He used Paul as a scapegoat for the inadequacies he couldn't face in himself. By tyrannizing Paul with impossible demands for perfection, and then verbally abusing him when the boy fell short, his stepfather could convince himself that he was powerful and strong. The damage he was doing to Paul probably never even crossed his mind. He thought he was helping the boy to be perfect.</div>

<div class="line_en">One of the most extreme examples of the havoc created by verbal abuse was Jason, 42, a handsome police officer in one of my hospital groups several years ago. The Los Angeles Police Department had insisted that he be hospitalized because the police psychologist had concluded that Jason was a suicide risk. At the hospital staff conference, I learned that Jason was consistently putting himself into unnecessarily life-threatening situations. For example, he had recently tried to make a drug bust by himself, without calling for the appropriate backup. He came very close to being killed. On the surface this appeared to be a heroic act, but it was actually reckless, irresponsible behavior. The word was out in the department: Jason was trying to kill himself in the line of duty.</div>

I don't remember a day when she didn't tell me she wished I'd never been born. On a good day, she'd say, "You look just like your goddamned father and you're just as rotten."

Internalization of negative opinions -- changing "you are" to "I am"-- forms the foundation of low self-esteem. Besides significantly impairing your sense of yourself as a lovable, valuable, competent person, verbal abuse can create self-fulfilling negative expectations about how you will get along in the world.
