<div class="line_en">He returned, humiliated, to address his humiliated nation. He was so humiliated he could not even speak. Tereza would never forget those awful pauses in the middle of his sentences. Was he that exhausted? 111? Had they drugged him? Or was it only despair? If nothing was to remain of Dubcek, then at least those awful long pauses when he seemed unable to breathe, when he gasped for air before a whole nation glued to its radios, at least those pauses would remain.</div>

<div class="line_en">But Tomas spent days on end at the hospital, and she was at home alone. At least she had Karenin and could take him on long walks! Home again, she would pore over her German and French grammars. But she felt sad and had trouble concentrating. She kept coming back to the speech Dubcek had given over the radio after his return from Moscow. Although she had completely forgotten what he said, she could still hear his quavering voice. She thought about how foreign soldiers had arrested him, the head of an independent state, in his own country, held him for four days somewhere in the Ukrainian mountains, informed him he was to be executed -- as, a decade before, they had executed his Hungarian counterpart Imre Nagy -- then packed him off to Moscow, ordered him to have a bath and shave, to change his clothes and put on a tie, apprised him of the decision to commute his execution, instructed him to consider himself head of state once more, sat him at a table opposite Brezhnev, and forced him to act.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="托马斯一连几天都在诊所，而她独自一人留在家里。幸好她还有卡列宁！她可以和它一起到外面多走一会儿！一回到家，她就坐下，捧一本德语课本或者法语课本，但是她情绪抑郁，根本无法集中精力。她经常想起杜布切克从莫斯科返回时发表的广播演说。他到底说了些什么，她一点也想不起来，但是耳畔依然回响着他那结结巴巴的声音。她想到他，一个主权国家的元首，竟在自己的国家被外国士兵逮捕，抓走，连续四天被非法囚禁在乌克兰山区的某个地方。他们要他明白，他们会把他杀了，就像十二年前他们杀了匈牙利的纳吉·伊姆雷。后来，他们把他转移到莫斯科，令他洗澡、刮脸、穿衣服、打领带，向他宣布不再把他交给行刑队处决，命令他把自己再当作国家元首，拉他在一张桌子旁坐下，面对勃列日涅夫，逼他谈判。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was the seventh day of the invasion. She heard the speech in the editorial offices of a newspaper that had been transformed overnight into an organ of the resistance. Everyone present hated Dubcek at that moment. They reproached him for compromising; they felt humiliated by his humiliation; his weakness offended them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="是入侵的第七天，她在一家日报的编辑部里收听演说。那些日子里，这家报纸已经成了抵抗运动的喉舌。那一刻，编辑部里所有的人，所有在听杜布切克讲话的人，都仇恨他。他们恨他接受妥协。他们为他的耻辱而耻辱，他的软弱激怒了他们。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The word weak no longer sounded like a verdict. Any man confronted with superior strength is weak, even if he has an athletic body like Dubcek's. The very weakness that at the time had seemed unbearable and repulsive, the weakness that had driven Tereza and Tomas from the country, suddenly attracted her. She realized that she belonged among the weak, in the camp of the weak, in the country of the weak, and that she had to be faithful to them precisely because they were weak and gasped for breath in the middle of sentences.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“软弱”一词也不再像判词一样响起。面对强力，人总是软弱的，即使拥有杜布切克那样健壮的身体。这份软弱曾令她憎恶，让她作呕，把她赶离了祖国，可此时突然间吸引着她。她明白她属于那些弱者，属于弱者的阵营，属于弱者的国家。她应该忠于他们，因为他们都是弱者，因为他们弱得说话都透不过气来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Thinking in Zurich of those days, she no longer felt any aversion to the man.</div>

<div class="line_en">She felt attracted by their weakness as by vertigo. She felt attracted by it because she felt weak herself. Again she began to feel jealous and again her hands shook. When Tomas noticed it, he did what he usually did: he took her hands in his and tried to calm them by pressing hard. She tore them away from him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她被软弱所吸引，如同被眩晕感所吸引。她之所以被吸引，是因为她感到自己软弱。当她又一次变得嫉妒的时候，她的手又开始颤抖。托马斯发现了，习惯性地伸出手：他用力地握着她的手，想使她平静下来。但是她挣脱了。">查看中文翻译</div>
