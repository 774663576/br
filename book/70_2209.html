<div class="line_en">As she flung open the door, the smile on her face faltered, replaced with a confused expression. A farmer stood in the doorway. He held his hat in one hand. In his other hand, he held the reins of Galahad's bridle. The big horse's head was hung low, the cart behind him empty. Her father was nowhere to be seen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当她急匆匆打开门的时候，她脸上的笑容变成了愕然的表情。门口站着一个农夫。他一只手拿着帽子，另一只手牵着加拉哈德的缰绳。这匹高头大马的头低垂着，身后的马车上没有人。看不到瑞拉的父亲。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This was too much to bear. Ella's vision began to blur and the blood drained from her face, leaving her pale and shaking. She reached out a hand and clutched the doorframe for support. Behind her, Lady Tremaine, Anastasia, and Drisella appeared.</div>

<div class="line_en">The days blurred one into another, with Ella the constant victim of her stepmother's increasing demands.

<div class="line_en">She saw how her stepmother looked at her -- as just another mouth to feed, an interloper in the house that now belonged to her. But Ella had made promises -- the one years earlier to her mother and the more recent one to her father. And she would not break those promises. Even if, as the days passed, she became less a sister and daughter and more a servant.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她知道继母怎么看待自己——一张等着吃饭的嘴，一个闯入继母家的无赖。但是瑞拉许下过诺言——几年前对母亲的承诺，还有后来对父亲的诺言。她要信守诺言。尽管，随着时间的流逝，自己不像是个妹妹或女儿，倒更像是个仆人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ella didn't have to wait long to find out her fate. Within days of receiving news of Ella's father's death, Lady Tremaine let the household staff go. With them gone, and her stepmother apparently too weak with grief to do anything, the duties of the house now fell fully on Ella's shoulders. It was left to her to pack up her father's clothes and sell them for whatever meager price they would fetch. When her sisters required their daily baths, it was Ella who made her way to the well and fetched buckets of water, then carried them slowly back to the house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没过多久，瑞拉就明白了自己的命运。接到父亲死讯后的几天里，特曼妮夫人把家里的仆人打发走了。仆人们走了以后，继母显然因为过于悲伤而虚弱得什么都不能做，所有的家务都落到了瑞拉的肩上。是她把父亲的衣物打包，以低廉的价格卖给别人。每天姐姐们要洗澡时，是她到井边打水，然后一桶一桶慢慢拎回家。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Anyone else might have buckled under the added burdens, but no matter what task Lady Tremaine or her stepsisters threw at her, Ella focused on staying positive. She hummed while she picked vegetables from the greenhouse. She sang as she washed and ironed. She even smiled as she helped Lady Tremaine into her dresses that cost more than the fired staff.</div>

<div class="line_en">One night, after a particularly long day, she found herself too exhausted to eat. Putting the small chunk of bread and meager serving of cheese on the floor, she called out to her only friends -- the mice Jacqueline and Gus. They appeared quickly, followed by their two small children, whom Ella had named Esau and Jacob. She watched as they ate their dinner. Ella was happy to see someone enjoying it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一天晚上，在忙碌了漫长的一天之后，瑞拉太累了，连饭都吃不下。她把小块的面包和一点点奶酪放在地板上，叫出自己仅有的朋友——小老鼠杰奎琳和葛斯。它们很快就出现了，后面还跟着它们的两个孩子，瑞拉给它们取名叫以扫和雅各布。瑞拉看着小老鼠一家享用晚餐。它们吃得津津有味，瑞拉也感到非常幸福。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ella woke with a start. The embers in the fireplace had long since grown cold, and she could hear her stepsisters and stepmother rustling about upstairs. Panicked, she leapt to her feet and scrambled around the kitchen, putting breakfast together. As the water began to boil, she rang the bell indicating breakfast was ready. The Tremaines had been taking their meals downstairs as of late, and they expected breakfast at the same time every morning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="瑞拉被惊醒了。壁炉里的余烬早就凉透了，她听到姐姐们和继母在楼上窸窸窣窣地穿衣。瑞拉慌忙跳起来，开始在厨房里忙碌起来，准备早餐。水开了，瑞拉拉了一下铃铛，告诉楼上的人早餐已经准备好了。最近特曼妮母女都是下楼吃早餐，她们希望每天都在同一个时间进餐。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At night, after the last of her chores was done and her stepmother and sisters were tucked into their beds, Ella was finally able to rest. Only then would her humming end, and she would let some sadness creep into her heart.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="瑞拉跪在地上，捡拾着碎片。瑞拉从壁炉上挂着的一把铜壶上看到自己的倒影，不禁吸了一口气。她的脸颊上满是煤灰，金黄色的头发也蓬乱不堪。她真成灰姑娘了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Suddenly, something inside Ella broke. For so long she had been trying to be the girl her mother and father would be proud of. She had kept her promises and tried to be gentle and kind. She had been courageous in the face of many unknownsand stayed strong when left alone. But now it seemed all for naught. Her new "family" had turned her into a creature of ash and toil. She was nothing but their plaything, someone to mock and order about. It was all too much.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jumping to her feet, Ella threw off her apron, and she raced for the stable. A moment later, Ella had Galahad in the aisle and was pulling herself up onto his strong back. Before anyone could stop her, she urged the horse forward and they took off.</div>

<div class="line_en">The trees whipped by in a blur and the wind prickled Ella's eyes, but she didn't care. Beneath her, Galahad's strong stride was calming and reassuring, a reminder of days gone by when she would ride for hours around the meadow, her father teaching her how to post, pick up the proper lead, and, eventually, take small jumps. Now, immersed in the fresh air, Ella felt like she could breathe for the first time in a long while. As they continued to race along, a smile spread across her face.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="飞驰中，看不清的树枝像鞭子一样抽过，风刺痛了她的眼睛，但瑞拉什么都顾不得了。在她身下，加拉哈德有力地奔跑着，瑞拉心里逐渐平静下来。她想着自己以前骑着马在草地上奔跑好几个小时，想着父亲教她怎么在马背上起坐，怎么选择正确的领行方向，一直到怎么越过小的障碍。现在置身清新的空气中，瑞拉觉得很久以来自己第一次可以自由呼吸了。加拉哈德继续向前奔跑时，瑞拉的脸上露出了笑容。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Galahad reared back, spooked, almost throwing Ella to the ground. Her legs gripped the horse's sides and she stayed astride. When she was sure Galahad wouldn't rear again, she began to rub his neck, calming him. It was only then that she noticed the sounds of an approaching hunt: the baying of hounds, along with the shouts of men and the pounding of horses' hooves. Ella knew that if the hunt caught up with this beautiful creature, he would be killed. She couldn't let that happen. "Run!" she called to the stag. "Go! Quickly!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="受惊的加拉哈德急忙后退，差点把瑞拉掀翻在地。她两腿紧紧夹住马背才没有摔下来。确信加拉哈德不会再后退时，她开始摩挲它的脖子，让它平静下来。直到这时瑞拉才听到附近有人在打猎：猎犬的吠声，男人的呼喊声，还有马蹄声。瑞拉知道如果他们发现这只美丽的动物，它就会被杀死。她不会让他们那么干的。“快跑！”她对牡鹿喊道，“快跑！快！”">查看中文翻译</div>
