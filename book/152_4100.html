<div class="line_en">But these days, I think about my life's importance. I wonder what it means, because my mother died three months ago, six days before my thirty-sixth birthday. And she's the only person I could have asked, to tell me about life's importance, to help me understand my grief.</div>

<div class="line_en">I now wear that pendant every day. I think the carvings mean something, because shapes and details, which I never seem to notice until after they're pointed out to me, always mean something to Chinese people. I know I could ask Auntie Lindo, Auntie An-mei, or other Chinese friends, but I also know they would tell me a meaning that is different from what my mother intended. What if they tell me this curving line branching into three oval shapes is a pomegranate and that my mother was wishing me fertility and posterity? What if my mother really meant the carvings were a branch of pears to give me purity and honesty? Or ten-thousand-year droplets from the magic mountain, giving me my life's direction and a thousand years of fame and immortality?</div>

<div class="line_en">Five months ago, after a crab dinner celebrating Chinese New Year, my mother gave me my "life's importance," a jade pendant on a gold chain. The pendant was not a piece of jewelry I would have chosen for myself. It was almost the size of my little finger, a mottled green and white color, intricately carved. To me, the whole effect looked wrong: too large, too green, too garishly ornate. I stuffed the necklace in my lacquer box and forgot about it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="五个月以前，在一次为庆祝中国阴历新年而举行的蟹宴上，妈送给我一个护身符，那是一块垂在金链条上的玉，这块玉不是我自己看中的。它几乎与我的小手指一般大小，绿白两色相混，精工细作地雕刻着许许多多花纹。依我的目光看，它作护身符不大合适，块头大大，颜色也太绿，而且太矫饰。因此我就顺手把它放进我的一只漆器盒中，过后也就忘记了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And because I think about this all the time, I always notice other people wearing these same jade pendants -- not the flat rectangular medallions or the round white ones with holes in the middle but ones like mine, a two-inch oblong of bright apple green. It's as though we were all sworn to the same secret covenant, so secret we don't even know what we belong to. Last weekend, for example, I saw a bartender wearing one. As I fingered mine, I asked him, "Where'd you get yours?"</div>

<div class="line_en">At last year's Chinese New Year dinner, my mother had cooked eleven crabs, one crab for each person, plus an extra. She and I had bought them on Stockton Street in Chinatown. We had walked down the steep hill from my parents' flat, which was actually the first floor of a six-unit building they owned on Leavenworth near California. Their place was only six blocks from where I worked as a copywriter for a small ad agency, so two or three times a week I would drop by after work. My mother always had enough food to insist that I stay for dinner.</div>

<div class="line_en">That year, Chinese New Year fell on a Thursday, so I got off work early to help my mother shop. My mother was seventy-one, but she still walked briskly along, her small body straight and purposeful, carrying a colorful flowery plastic bag. I dragged the metal shopping cart behind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那年的中国阴历新年是周四，因此我早早地下班后，便陪着妈去采购年货了。妈七十一岁了，仍旧健步如飞，小小的身子挺得笔直，腋下夹着只彩色塑料包，我则拖着小拖车跟在她后面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Every time I went with her to Chinatown, she pointed out other Chinese women her age. "Hong Kong ladies," she said, eyeing two finely dressed women in long, dark mink coats and perfect black hairdos. "Cantonese, village people," she whispered as we passed women in knitted caps, bent over in layers of padded tops and men's vests. And my mother -- wearing light-blue polyester pants, a red sweater, and a child's green down jacket -- she didn't look like anybody else. She had come here in 1949, at the end of a long journey that started in Kweilin in 1944; she had gone north to Chungking, where she met my father, and then they went southeast to Shanghai and fled farther south to Hong Kong, where the boat departed for San Francisco. My mother came from many different directions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="每次我们在唐人街踱步时，她总要议论一番其他的中国女人。“香港太太。”那次看着两个打扮讲究，穿着貂皮黑大衣的太太走过时，她便低声嘟哝了一句。当另一个戴着手编绒线帽、穿着男式衬衣的女人走过时，她则不屑地翻翻眼睛：“广东人，乡巴佬。”而她自己，则穿着浅蓝色的化纤长裤，上面是大红的绒线衫、外罩一件小孩子穿的绿色羽绒外套——很是与众不同。她是1949年到美国的。自从1944年她从桂林战火中逃出后，她北上重庆，便在那里结识了我爸，然后他们又颠沛到上海，再从上海出逃到香港，然后从那里乘船抵达旧金山。她跋涉了好多地方。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And now she was huffing complaints in rhythm to her walk downhill. "Even you don't want them, you stuck," she said. She was fuming again about the tenants who lived on the second floor. Two years ago, she had tried to evict them on the pretext that relatives from China were coming to live there. But the couple saw through her ruse to get around rent control. They said they wouldn't budge until she produced the relatives. And after that I had to listen to her recount every new injustice this couple inflicted on her.</div>

But before I could even decide what to name my new pet, my mother had dropped it into a pot of cold water and placed it on the tall stove. I had watched with growing dread, as the water heated up and the pot began to clatter with this crab trying to tap his way out of his own hot soup. To this day, I remember that crab screaming as he thrust one bright red claw out over the side of the bubbling pot. It must have been my own voice, because now I know, of course, that crabs have no vocal cords. And I also try to convince myself that they don't have enough brains to know the difference between a hot bath and a slow death.</div>

Without even asking, my mother knew that meant including the Jongs' children: their son Vincent, who was thirty-eight years old and still living at home, and their daughter, Waverly, who was around my age. Vincent called to see if he could also bring his girlfriend, Lisa Lum. Waverly said she would bring her new fiancé, Rich Schields, who, like Waverly, was a tax attorney at Price Waterhouse. And she added that Shoshana, her four-year-old daughter from a previous marriage, wanted to know if my parents had a VCR so she could watch Pinocchio, just in case she got bored.

And because she had learned this skill, of choosing the best, from her mother, it was only natural that her mother knew how to pick the next-best ones for her husband, her son, his girlfriend, and herself. And my mother, of course, considered the four remaining crabs and gave the one that looked the best to Old Chong, because he was nearly ninety and deserved that kind of respect, and then she picked another good one for my father.

<div class="line_en">My father hasn't eaten well since my mother died. So I am here, in the kitchen, to cook him dinner. I'm slicing tofu. I've decided to make him a spicy bean-curd dish. My mother used to tell me how hot things restore the spirit and health. But I'm making this mostly because I know my father loves this dish and I know how to cook it. I like the smell of it: ginger, scallions, and a red chili sauce that tickles my nose the minute I open the jar.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="自从我妈去世后，我父亲一直吃得不好。因此我只要上他那里，就顺便也为他煮点好吃的。今天，我准备为他烧一碗麻辣豆腐。妈常说，吃烫的食物，可以帮助恢复元气和精神。爸挺喜欢吃麻辣豆腐。">查看中文翻译</div>
