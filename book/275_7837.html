<div class="line_en">What the frog said did happen, and the queen gave birth to a girl who was so beautiful that the king could not contain himself for joy, and he ordered a great celebration. He invited not only his relatives, friends, and acquaintances, but also the wise women so that they would be kindly disposed toward the child. There were thirteen of them in his kingdom, but because he had only twelve golden plates from which they were to eat, one of them had to remain at home.</div>

<div class="line_en">The eleventh one had just pronounced her blessing when the thirteenth one suddenly walked in. She wanted to avenge herself for not having been invited, and without greeting anyone or even looking at them she cried out with a loud voice, "In the princess's fifteenth year she shall prick herself with a spindle and fall over dead." And without saying another word she turned around and left the hall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当第十一个女巫师刚刚为她祝福之后，第十三个女巫师，也就是那个没有被邀请的女巫师走了进来，她对没有被邀请感到非常愤怒，她要对此进行报复，要献上她恶毒的咒语。所以她进来后就大声叫道：「国王的女儿在十五岁时会被一个纺锤弄伤，最后死去。」">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The king, wanting to rescue his dear child, issued an order that all spindles in the entire kingdom should be burned.

<div class="line_cn" title="国王为了不使他的女儿遭到那种不幸，命令将王国里的所有纺锤都收上来，又把它们全部销毁。随着时间的流逝，女巫师们的所有祝福都在公主身上应验了：她聪明美丽，性格温柔，举止优雅，真是人见人爱。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now it happened that on the day when she turned fifteen years of age the king and the queen were not at home, and the girl was all alone in the castle. She walked around from one place to the next, looking into rooms and chambers as her heart desired. Finally she came to an old tower. She climbed up the narrow, winding stairs and arrived at a small door. In the lock there was a rusty key, and when she turned it the door sprang open. There in a small room sat an old woman with a spindle busily spinning her flax.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但恰恰在她十五岁的那一天，国王和王后都不在家，公主单独一个人被留在王宫里。她在宫里到处穿来穿去，大小房间都看完了，最后，她来到了一个古老的宫楼。宫楼里面有一座很狭窄的楼梯，楼梯尽头有一扇门，门上插着一把金钥匙。当她转动金钥匙时，门一下子就弹开了，一个老太婆坐在里面在忙着纺纱。">查看中文翻译</div>

Because she was unable to undo the wicked wish, but only to soften it, she said, "It shall not be her death. The princess will only fall into a hundred-year deep sleep."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所有在场的人都大惊失色。可是第十二个女巫师还没有献上她的礼物，便走上前来说：「这个凶险的咒语的确会应验，但公主能够化险为夷。她不会死去，而只是昏睡过去，而且一睡就是一百年。」">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She had no sooner touched the spindle when the magic curse was fulfilled, and she pricked herself in the finger. The instant that she felt the prick she fell onto a bed that was standing there, and she lay there in a deep sleep. And this sleep spread throughout the entire castle. The king and queen, who had just returned home, walked into the hall and began falling asleep, and all of their attendants as well. The horses fell asleep in their stalls, the dogs in the courtyard, the pigeons on the roof, the flies on the walls, and even the fire on the hearth flickered, stopped moving, and fell asleep. The roast stopped sizzling. The cook, who was about to pull kitchen boy's hair for having done something wrong, let him loose and fell asleep. The wind stopped blowing, and outside the castle not a leaf was stirring in the trees.</div>

<div class="line_en">Many long, long years later, once again a prince came to the country. He heard an old man telling about the thorn hedge. It was said that there was a castle behind it, in which a beautiful princess named Little Brier-Rose had been asleep for a hundred years, and with her the king and the queen and all the royal attendants were sleeping. He also knew from his grandfather that many princes had come and tried to penetrate the thorn hedge, but they had become stuck in it and died a sorrowful death.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="许多许多年过去了，一天，又有一位王子踏上了这块土地。一位老大爷向他讲起了蒺藜树丛的故事，说树篱之内有一座漂亮的王宫，王宫里有一位仙女般的公主，她的名字叫玫瑰公主，她和整座王宫及里面的人都在沉睡。他还说，他曾听他的爷爷谈起有许许多多的王子来过这儿，他们都想穿过树篱，但都被缠在里面死去了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Round about the castle a thorn hedge began to grow, and every year it became higher, until it finally surrounded and covered the entire castle. Finally nothing at all could be seen of it, not even the flag on the roof.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不久，王宫的四周长出了一道蒺藜组成的大篱笆，年复一年，它们越长越高，越长越茂密，最后竟将整座宫殿遮得严严实实，甚至连屋顶和烟囱也看不见了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A legend circulated throughout the land about the beautiful sleeping Little Brier-Rose, for so the princess was called. Legends also told that from time to time princes came, wanting to force their way through the hedge into the castle. However, they did not succeed, for the thorns held firmly together, as though they had hands, and the young men became stuck in them, could not free themselves, and died miserably.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="於是，关於这个王国流传开了这样一个传说，一个漂亮的正在睡觉的玫瑰公主的传说，人们所说的玫瑰公主其实就是国王的女儿。从那以后，有不少王子来探险，他们披荆斩棘想穿过树篱到王宫里去，但都没有成功，不是被蒺藜缠住就是被树丛跘倒在里面，就像是有无数只手牢牢地抓住他们难以脱身一样，他们最终都痛苦地死去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="这天，时间正好过去了一百年，所以当王子来到树篱丛时，他看到的全是盛开着美丽花朵的灌木，他很轻松地就穿过了树篱。随着他在前面走，身后树篱又密密地合拢了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the courtyard he saw the horses and spotted hunting dogs lying there asleep, and on the roof the pigeons, perched with their little heads tucked under they wings. When he walked inside the flies were asleep on the wall, the cook in the kitchen was still holding up his hand as if he wanted to grab the boy, and the maid was sitting in front of the black chicken that was supposed to be plucked. He walked further and saw all the attendants lying asleep in the hall, and above them near the throne the king and the queen were lying.</div>

<div class="line_en">They went downstairs together, and the king awoke, and the queen, and all the royal attendants, and they looked at one another in amazement. The horses in the courtyard stood up and shook themselves. The hunting dogs jumped and wagged their tails. The pigeons on the roof pulled their little heads out from beneath their wings, looked around, and flew into the field. The flies on the walls crept about again. The fire in the kitchen rose up, broke into flames, and cooked the food. The roast began to sizzle once again. The cook boxed the boy's ears, causing him to cry, and the maid finished plucking the chicken.</div>
