<div class="line_en">Feng Rui slapped the fish, hard, on the edge of the bath. Then he took a knife and started scraping away its scales, which flicked into the air in a glassy scatter. But the fish was still alive. It flexed violently, and jumped out of his hands. Feng Rui snorted in exasperation, seized it and then whacked it, harder this time, against the enamel. The fish, stunned, became still, allowing him to scale it clean, rip out its blood-red gills, slit its belly open and finger out the bulging slickness of its guts. By now the small bathroom was a mess of scales and slime, but, unconcerned, Feng Rui simply gathered up the debris and threw it into the bin. Back in the kitchen, he made a few incisions in the fish's side, rubbed it with salt and wine, smashed a clod of ginger and a couple of spring onions and stuffed them into its belly. Then he lit a cigarette and inhaled deeply. 'You know, you won't believe this, but in Guangdong they actually eat fish intestines! Imagine! How disgusting. Those Cantonese, they eat anything.' I cast my eye to the kitchen counter, where a bowlful of chicken intestines were marinating, ready for our lunch, and smiled to myself.</div>

We're cooking together tomorrow. Want to come?' Normally I wouldn't accept invitations from strangers in nightclubs, but when he mentioned red-oil chicken and twice-cooked pork, I felt ready to agree to almost anything.

<div class="line_en">Around the eel stall alone, there was always a bloodbath. The eels were paddy eels, their shiny skins a dark grey-green, thin as a finger, a yard-or-so long, coiled like snakes in tubfuls of water. Preparing them for sale was a simple but messy business. The vendor, seated on a low wooden stool, cigarette on his lip, grabbed a specimen by its neck, and, as it flicked and flailed, impaled its head on a spike at the top of a strip of wood propped up between his knees (a crunchy, squelching sound). Fag still in mouth, he took a small dirty knife, slit the twitching creature from neck to tail, and scraped the mess of its spine and guts into a bucket at the base of the board. A few stray bits of intestine or internal organ splattered to the ground. Finally, he chopped off and discarded its head and tail, and tossed the blood-streaked body into another plastic pail. 'You have to eat them fresh,' said Feng Rui, 'Leave them for an hour and their flavour spoils.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="单说那个卖黄鳝的摊子吧，就总是在一片血泊之中。一条条黄鳝有着闪亮的外皮，是那种深深的灰绿色；它们细如手指，一米左右的长度，在大水盆里像蛇一样盘踞着。要卖就要剖，剖黄鳝倒是挺简单的，就是又脏又血腥。小贩坐在矮矮的木凳子上，嘴上叼着烟，抓住一条黄鳝的脖子，也不管这小生灵如何地拼命挣扎跳动，就把黄鳝头往他双膝之间竖起来的一根木头钉的尖上一钉（发出“嘎吱”一声）。烟还是叼在嘴上，他拿过一把脏兮兮的小刀，把这抽搐的东西从脖子一直剖到尾巴，刮掉一堆血淋淋、乱糟糟的内脏，直接扔进下面一个桶里。有时候一些内脏还是会飞溅到地上。最后，他把黄鳝剁成几节，头和尾巴丢掉，血呼啦的身体放进另一个塑料袋里。“必须吃新鲜的，”冯锐说，“一个小时不处理，味道就不好了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I'd been to many Chinese markets before that outing with Feng Rui, and had at first been amazed -- and appalled -- by the cruelty I witnessed. It was the sheer nonchalance of it, the way people scaled fish as though they were simply peeling potatoes, skinned live rabbits while smoking a cigarette, joked with a friend as the blood drained from the throat of a bewildered duck. They didn't kill animals before they cooked and ate them. They simply went about the process of preparing a creature for the pot and table, and at some random point it died. But there, perhaps, is the crux of the matter, embedded almost invisibly in those last two sentences. In English, as in most European languages, the words for the living things we eat are mostly derived from the Latin anima, which means air, breath, life. 'Creature', from the Latin for 'created', seems to connect animals with us as human beings in some divinely fashioned universe. We too are creatures, animated. In Chinese, the word for animal is dong wu, meaning 'moving thing'. Is it cruel to hurt something that (unless you are a fervent Buddhist) you simply see as a 'moving thing', scarcely even alive?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="和冯锐买这一趟菜之前，我也去过很多中国的菜市场了。一开始，那种残酷和血腥真是让我大吃一惊。人们似乎对生命完全漠不关心，剖鱼就跟削土豆皮一样稀松平常；活剥兔子皮的时候还能悠闲地抽支烟；给一只还没反应过来的鸭子割喉放血，一边还跟朋友插科打诨。他们不会在动物下锅或者上桌之前早早地弄死，而是直接开始准备这个食材，任其在这过程中死去。不过，也许，问题的关键就无形地包含在这形式之中。在英语和大多数欧洲语言中，可供人吃的有生命的东西，用于它们的词很多都来自拉丁语的“anima”，代表着空气、呼吸、生命。英语里的“creature”（生灵）这个词，来自拉丁语中和“创造”有关的词，似乎将动物与我们人类联系在了某个十分神圣的宇宙当中。我们也都是生灵、是动物。而中文里的“动物”一词，可以直接解释为“移动的物体”。如果说你只是把其简单看作一个“移动的物体”，几乎没什么生命可言，那伤害其性命还算是残酷吗（除非你是个虔诚的佛教徒）？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Culture shock hit me hardest when I was invited to lunch by a motherly middle-aged woman in her special rabbit restaurant, not long after I had arrived in Chengdu. 'Come into the kitchen and watch,' she urged me. When we entered, the main ingredient for our stew was sitting sweetly in the corner of the room, nibbling lettuce.

<div class="line_en">Some of the cruellest tales of Chinese eating are apochryphal. A late-nineteenth-century account of life in Beijing by a Dr D. F. Rennie included a description of cooking a live turtle. The special pot used, he said, had a hole for the turtle's head in its lid, so the poor creature, growing thirsty with heat, could be fed with spiced wine, which perfumed its flesh as it cooked. He also recounted how live ducks were stood on a hotplate over a fire in order to cook just their feet. Were they true, these ghoulish stories? Dr Rennie admitted that they were secondhand, told to him by a Shanghai merchant. An elderly Buddhist monk once described to me with wide eyes and a solemn manner a Cantonese dish called 'san jiao' (three cries): 'The first cry,' he told me, 'is when they pick up the wriggling new-born mouse in their chopsticks, the second when they dip it in the sauce, and the third when they bite off its head.' I wasn't sure whether to believe that they really ate live mice in southern China, or simply that this gentle monk, a lifelong vegetarian, was trying to put me off my meat.</div>

<div class="line_en">But if the most infamous examples of Chinese culinary cruelty are urban myths, the everyday cruelty of Chinese cooking can be shocking. Once I was served with a dish called 'sauna prawns' in a smart hotel in Chengdu. The waitress brought in a tabletop burner, and a potful of hot water covered by a grill and a perspex lid. When the water was boiling, she took off the lid, threw in a plateful of live prawns, and then replaced it. We watched through the perspex as the prawns writhed and flicked on the grill in their 'sauna' steam. When they were cooked, we were supposed to remove the lid and eat them, with a soy sauce dip. I didn't find the dish very appetising. But I couldn't say there was anything sadistic about the enthusiasm of my Chinese companions, because, although they were amused by the agonising display on the table before us, as far as they were concerned, the prawns were just moving, not feeling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，就算中国烹饪界这些最最令人毛骨悚然的残酷只不过是都市传说，但那些日常的“残酷”也足以让西方人叹为观止了。一次，我在成都一家小酒店里吃到一道菜，“桑拿虾”。服务员在桌上放了个简易燃气炉，上面是一锅热水，再盖上一层铁网和一个玻璃锅盖。水烧开了，她揭开锅盖，扔进一盘活大虾，又盖上锅盖。透过玻璃锅盖，我们看着对虾“蒸桑拿”，在不断上升的蒸汽中扭动翻滚。煮好以后，就可以揭开锅盖，蘸酱油吃。我对这道菜没什么胃口。同桌的中国朋友们倒是充满热情，不过我也不能认为他们就是虐待狂了。看着桌上这痛苦的表演他们都表现得很愉快兴奋，在他们眼里，这些大虾不过是移动的物体，并没有什么感觉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">All over the world, people have heard of that notorious Chinese delicacy, live monkey brains. The monkey, so they say, is strapped to the table, its head immobilised in some kind of vice. Then the waiter slices off the top of its skull, and you eat its brains with a spoon, like pudding. But has anyone actually seen this practice? A journalist writing in the Japan Times in 2002, Mark Schreiber, said his own exhaustive investigations had produced no first-hand accounts, and suggested that the legend might be traced back to a tongue-in-cheek newspaper column on Chinese eating habits written in 1948.</div>

<div class="line_en">That morning at the market, Feng Rui took me to a poultry stall where toffee-coloured chickens stood around in a woven bamboo pen, mobile and jittery. The ducks lay more serenely on the ground, their feet bound with bunches of rice straw. Every day the city's duck sellers brought in clumps of ducks on carts attached to three-wheeled bicycles; their heads and necks swayed elegantly above their anchor of straw as the sellers negotiated their way through the maelstrom of bicycles and buses. Like the eels, the chickens and ducks met a bloody, public end. 'Let's have a look at that one,' said Feng Rui. So the vendor snatched the chicken by the scruff of its neck and held it up for his approval. Feng Rui prodded it and peered at its feet. 'You can tell its age by the feet,' he told me, 'This one, you see, its thumb has scarcely developed, that means it's quite young, its flesh will be tender. If the thumb is long and gnarled, it's an old bird, best for making soup. Yes, I'll take this one,' he told the vendor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天早上，冯锐带我去了菜市场一个卖家禽的摊子，竹编的围栏里有很多棕褐色的鸡，躁动不安又战战兢兢。鸭子趴在地上，略微安详宁静，腿都被一根根稻草缠了好几圈。每天，成都的鸭贩子都会骑着三轮车，后面拉着一车车鸭子。鸭贩子在自行车和公交车的拥挤车流中艰难行进着，鸭子们的脖子就从那些稻草中伸出来，优雅地摇摆着。和黄鳝一样，鸡与鸭的结局也是被公开血腥残杀。“看哈那一只，”冯锐说。小贩抓住鸡的后颈，把它拎起来让冯锐看。他戳了戳鸡肚子，看了眼鸡脚。“看鸡脚就晓得有好大（5）了，”他告诉我。“你看这只嘛，拇趾还没咋个发育，说明还很小，肉比较嫩。如果拇趾比较长而且节疤多，那就老了，拿来熬汤最好了。好，就要这只，”他对小贩说。【注：（5）四川话会把“多少钱”、“多大年纪”说成“好多钱”、“好大年纪”。这里的“好大”是指“多大年龄”。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As time went by, of course, I dirtied my own hands in the blood of the markets: I insisted on seeing my fish and chickens killed in front me so that I knew they were fresh; I watched nonchalantly as the eel vendor wreaked carnage for my lunch. Although the Chinese attitude to dong wu continued to disturb me, at least it was honest, I thought. Back at home in Britain, the stench of death hung in the background of a carnivorous meal like a guilty secret; people bought their meat safe and sanitised, while the animals languished in battery pens. In China, you saw what meat meant, there was no avoiding it. You chose to eat it, with your eyes open.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，时间一天天过去，我自己的手上也沾满了菜市场的鲜血。我坚持让小贩当着我的面杀鱼和鸡，这样才知道都是新鲜的；卖黄鳝的当着我的面对午饭食材展开残忍大屠杀，我也是一脸无动于衷。虽然中国人对“动物”的态度一直让我困扰，但至少是诚实的。在英国，一顿肉食为主的聚餐，死亡的腥臭就像秘而不宣的罪恶，被掩藏在所有人都看不见的背后。人们都是在超市买安全卫生的肉食，动物们在养殖场经历悲凉痛苦的短暂一生后惨遭杀害，这样的情景没人看得到。而在中国，你能看到肉食到底是怎么来的、意味着什么，真是无处躲藏。你睁大眼睛亲眼看着，然后选择吃掉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So the vendor drew back the head of the bird and slit its throat with a knife. He shook the blood into a plastic bag, plunged the fowl into a potful of hot water that sat on a charcoal stove. The bird was still twitching as he sat down on his stool and began to strip off its feathers. Then he dipped it into a potful of bubbling tar that clung to it like rubber, set the tar in cold water, and peeled off the sticky black shroud with all the stubby quills and remaining tiny feathers, like a leg wax. Working quickly, he slit open its belly and disembowelled it, discarding the stomach and gall bladder in a shambles on the ground, keeping the prized gizzard, liver, heart and intestines, which he handed over to Feng Rui with the small bagful of blood. The other live birds hung around nearby, stupidly.</div>

The other was chopping a flattened smoked rabbit into small chunks. Feng Rui rinsed the chicken's intestines, cut them into sections with a sharp cleaver, and sprinkled them with a little salt. Then, having dispatched the carp in the bathroom, he put the whole chicken and the chunk of pork into a panful of water, and set them to boil on the stove. 'Your "European chickens" (ou zhou ji),' he said with disdain, 'They may be tender but they're completely tasteless. It's all that artificial feed, it plumps them up, but it makes their flesh unhealthy. Our Chinese birds, they are fed on leftover rice and stuff, and they run around in the farmyard, so they have much more flavour.' He continued to talk as he put the bagful of chicken blood into a panful of simmering water, where it set to a jelly, and blanched the intestines to clean them. And then he prodded his taciturn friend to give me the recipe for smoked rabbit, which involved skinning the animal alive, rubbing it in a marinade of salt and spices, flattening its body between two heavy stones, crucifying it on a cross of wooden sticks, and then smoking it over a smouldering fire of pine, camphor and cypress leaves. I wasn't sure how easy it would be to reproduce that particular recipe in London, but I took notes assiduously, eager to miss nothing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="冯锐和我提着买来的食材，溜达着到了他朋友的公寓。鸡和内脏都好整以暇地装在袋子里；一条活蹦乱跳的鲤鱼在手上扳动着；还有一条猪臀肉、几串葱。屋里，他前晚提到的两名一流酒店顶尖大厨正等着我们：其中一位坐在扶手椅上，抽着烟；另一位正把一只完全躺平的烟熏兔子剁成小块。冯锐清洗了鸡内脏，用锋利的菜刀切了丁，拿盐腌了起来。接着，他把鲤鱼扔进卫生间，再把鸡和猪肉放进一锅水里，放到炉子上烧开。“你们欧洲的鸡，”他不屑地说，“肉还是嫩，就是根本没得味道。都是用的人工饲料，喂是喂肥了，但是肉的营养都没得了。我们中国的鸡，吃的是剩饭剩菜，在农民院子头到处跑，味道好得多嘛。”他一边说着，一边把那袋鸡血放进一锅慢慢煨着的水中，让血凝固成果冻状。然后又洗了鸡肠。接着他戳了戳那位沉默寡言的朋友，叫他给我讲讲烟熏兔的做法：首先是要活剥兔皮，用盐和香料揉搓腌制；拿两块很重的石头压住身体两边让其躺平，晾在木棍做成的十字架上；然后用松枝、樟树和柏树叶生火，拿这个烟来熏。我不知道在伦敦实现这个菜谱能有多大把握，但还是很勤奋地做着笔记，不想漏掉任何细节。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A former chef, Feng Rui owned two or three modest restaurants and bars in Chengdu. He was a small-time businessman, taking advantage of the new economic liberalisation to escape the inferno of the Chinese restaurant kitchen. But he was fascinated by the art and science of cookery; it was his passion as well as his profession. I understood this from his perfectionist attention to detail, the tenderness with which he talked about food and his obvious pride in passing on some of his knowledge to a curious foreigner. But this pride, and his pleasure, were always tinged with bitterness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="冯锐以前也是酒店大厨，现在成都有两三家小餐馆和酒吧。他是个生意人，利用经济开放的新机遇逃离了中国饭店后厨的“人间地狱”。但他对烹饪的艺术与科学仍然相当着迷，这既是他从前的职业，也是他的激情所在。看他对细节近乎完美的追求、说起食物时那种温柔的语气以及对我这个好奇的外国人传授知识时显而易见的骄傲，一切便不言自明。但这种骄傲、这种愉悦，却也总是被某种怨气冲淡。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As I came to know Feng Rui better over the next few years, I learned about his own, troubled family background. His father, Feng Mang, had been a military man, an engineer in the Nationalist air force, and when the Nationalists were defeated in the Chinese civil war, he found himself on the wrong side of history. During the Cultural Revolution, Feng Mang was 'struggled against' because of his political background, and imprisoned for seven long years, during which time he never saw his family. In the eyes of the revolutionary state and its brainwashed society, his six children were all contaminated by the seeping stain of their father's ideological misdeeds. Feng Rui, only four when the Cultural Revolution started, was bullied at school, and lost a year of his education. Later, he was excluded from military service. 'We had no political prospects, no future, and no "face" in society,' he told me. 'We were always under pressure.'</div>

<div class="line_en">But Feng Rui found his solace in the kitchen. As a child, he hovered around the family stove, learning from his parents. At the age of only eight or nine, eager to develop his culinary skills, he began helping out at wedding banquets. People were poor then: it was the height of the Cultural Revolution; food was rationed, and life was harsh. But at weddings the chefs had a rare chance to show off their skills. 'I have loved cooking for as long as I can remember,' Feng Rui told me one day, 'and by the time I was twenty I wanted to be recognised as a chef.' In 1984 he qualified as a 'Chef of the Second Rank' in the official Chinese culinary hierarchy, and was the envy of those around him, because people knew, in those hard times, that chefs were guaranteed a decent diet. Yet in the eyes of the educated, cooks like him were little more than servants.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但冯锐在厨房里找到了慰藉。很小的时候他就在家里的炉子边转悠，从奶奶那里学习厨艺。八九岁的时候，迫切想提升烹饪技能的他就开始在婚宴上帮厨。那时候人们很穷：恰逢“文化大革命”的高峰，食品是定量配给的，生活很苦。婚礼是大厨们为数不多施展技艺的机会。“从我记事开始，就一直爱做饭，”有一天，冯锐告诉我，“二十岁的时候，我就想当大厨了。”一九八四年，他获得了中国官方的“二级厨师资格”，让周围的人相当羡慕。因为在那个艰难的年代，大家都知道，厨师是肯定能吃饱吃好的。不过，在那些受过良好教育的人们眼中，像他这样的厨师比用人好不到哪儿去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Cooking is traditionally a lowly profession in China. The development of a refined palate and an appreciation of food was part of the education of the Confucian gentleman, but the actual cookery fell to the lot of the uneducated masses. Boys from poor households went into service in restaurants or private kitchens, often simply because their families knew they would be given three square meals a day. Many were illiterate, and they passed on their skills from one generation to another without the use of written manuals. They were known, disparagingly sometimes, as the 'fire-head army'. Snobbery about kitchen work has its roots, perhaps, in the writings of Mencius, one of the great Confucian philosophers, who lived in the fourth century BC. Mencius saw a chasm between mental and manual work, and famously said that 'the gentleman keeps his distance from the kitchen'.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从中国传统来说，厨师的确是地位比较低的职业。按儒家的讲法，君子要有细致灵敏的味觉，对食物也要很讲究，但真正在烟火中忙碌的厨师职业，却属于那些没受过教育的大众。穷人家的男孩子才会去餐馆或私厨做学徒。很多时候原因很简单，这些人家知道，只有做厨师才有不错的一日三餐。很多厨师都是文盲，技艺一代代地传下来，都没有文字记载。也许从公元前四世纪儒学名家孟子的著述中，能找到轻视厨师的根源。孟子认为，脑力劳动和体力劳动是有根本区别的，他有句名言是：“君子远庖厨。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">This is not to say that there aren't a few chefs in the Chinese history books. Yi Yin, a legendary cook of the Shang Dynasty, impressed the King of Tang so much with his knowledge of cooking that he was made prime minister. In the Zhou Dynasty, another chef, Yi Ya, was promoted at court after enrapturing the Duke of Qi with a series of midnight feasts. In a dark twist to the tale, he also steamed his own son to satisfy the Duke's desire to taste the flesh of an infant. Despite this monstrous act, he is still fondly remembered for the brilliance of his cooking. Chefs in Hunan province still revere Yi Ya as the ancestor of their profession: until the Cultural Revolution they made offerings to his image in a dedicated cooks' temple. Most of the famous names in Chinese culinary history, however, are those of gourmets, members of the literati who enjoyed eating, and who wrote about it in prose or poetry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但中国的历史书上也是能找出几位鼎鼎大名的厨师的。商朝传奇厨师伊尹，丰富的烹饪知识令君主商汤大为叹服，被任命为丞相。周朝又出了个大厨，易牙，为齐桓公准备了一系列午夜大宴，很得欢心，在朝廷的仕途也是顺风顺水。关于他有个相当阴暗的传说：因为齐桓公想要吃婴儿肉，易牙就把自己的儿子煮了，满足齐桓公的愿望。虽然这举动和魔鬼无异，后代依然纪念他在烹饪上的高超造诣。湖南省的厨师们仍然把易牙尊为祖师，一直到“文革”之前，他们都还会去专门供奉易牙的寺庙，在画像前进贡。不过，中国烹饪史上大多数响当当的名字，都是美食家，是嗜吃的文人墨客，他们以食物为主题，作诗著文。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Perhaps the most famous among them is Yuan Mei, an eighteenth-century essayist and poet. He retired early from the civil service, and based himself for the rest of his life in the southern city of Nanjing, where he bought a piece of land and built the 'Garden of Contentment', a series of gracious pavilions laid out in a romantic landscape. Among his writings, Yuan Mei left to posterity a remarkable cookery book, The Food Lists of the Garden of Contentment. In it, he wrote of culinary theory and technique, advising on hygiene and the selection of ingredients, outlining his own food taboos, suggesting which flavours went harmoniously together, and offering hints on menu planning. He also recorded some three hundred recipes, ranging from simple vegetable stir-fries to elaborate duck preparations. But Yuan Mei never sullied his own hands in the kitchen. He was an observer, standing at the shoulder of his skilled personal chef, Wang Xiaoyu, tasting, taking notes, and asking questions.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="其中最著名的恐怕要数袁枚，十八世纪的散文家和诗人。他很早就从朝廷的官位上隐退，余生都居住在今天的南京。他在那里买了块地，修了“随园”，布景十分浪漫雅致，还有很多精美的楼阁。众多著述中，袁枚留给子孙后代一本相当了不起的食谱，《随园食单》。他在书中记录了烹饪理论和技法，提了很多卫生和食材选择方面的建议，列出了自己在食物方面的禁忌偏好，写了哪些味道融在一起比较和谐，并且对菜单的设计也提点一二。他还记录了三百多道菜谱，从简单的炒菜到复杂的鸭肉菜肴。但袁枚很有可能一辈子都是十指不沾阳春水。他只是一名观察者，站在家中优秀私厨王小馀的身后，尝菜、做笔记、问问题。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Yuan himself gave due credit to the man who worked such magic for his dinner parties. After Wang died, Yuan missed him so much that he wrote his biography, an account of the life of a 'lowly person' that sat somewhat uneasily alongside his more conventional biographies of literary and upper-class figures. Two and a half centuries later, however, the name of Wang Xiaoyu has faded into obscurity, while Yuan Mei's lives on in the memories of all those who are interested in Chinese culinary culture. It's a similar story with other notable gourmets: the dishes they loved bear their names, but the men who worked so hard to feed them are forgotten. One of the few exceptions is the Song Dynasty poet Su Dongpo, who wrote so lovingly about pork that he was immortalised in the name of the Hangzhou dish 'Dongpo Rou', but who also liked personally to prepare food for his wife and his favourite concubine. Mostly, though, it was the masters who ate and pontificated, while their nameless chefs slaved away over the stove and the chopping board.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the post-reform era, highly skilled chefs in China can command lofty salaries. One I know wears designer clothes, has two cars, two apartments and various investments, and likes to go on holiday to the wild places of Tibet. Cooking has become a more attractive career, particularly since it offers the possibility of working abroad. Yet the prejudice against it as a respectable profession runs deep in Chinese society. One of my mentors, the Cantonese cookery writer Yan-kit So, who began her career as a first-class historian, had to defy the disapproval of her well-educated and well-heeled friends when she turned her attention to food. It just wasn't the kind of thing a nice girl should do. And my own Chinese friends have always been baffled by the fact that I choose to associate with dumpling makers and beancurd sellers as well as 'intellectuals'.</div>

<div class="line_en">But, for Feng Rui and countless other people throughout Chinese history, the pleasures of food have also been a refuge from the difficulties of personal and professional life. Eating was the solace of the exiled and the excluded; it offered sweet respite from the bitterness of life. In a society fraught by political danger, where individuals were subject to the arbitrary rule of their imperial or communist masters, and careers and reputations could be broken on a whim, it was a safe pleasure, one in which you could lose yourself without fear. The poet Su Dongpo started growing his own vegetables and experimenting in the kitchen only after the collapse of his official career and the start of an impoverished exile. Feng Rui, ostracised in his formative years, his father persecuted and imprisoned, found joy in the colours and flavours of the kitchen. It gave him his freedom, and it unleashed his creativity.</div>

It was made with all the parts of the chicken that most European cooks would throw away: the blood, set to a jelly, the gizzard, the heart, the liver, and the intestines. They were all cooked in the wok with pickled red chilli and ginger, and batons of slender, fragrant Chinese celery. Each innard was prepared in a way that would make the most of its particular qualities of taste or texture.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was typical of the careful economy of Sichuanese home cooking that almost nothing of Feng Rui's chicken was wasted. And it was the same with the fish that I'd seen slaughtered in the bathroom (apart from its intestines -- fit only, as Feng Rui had told me so disparagingly, for the foul-feeding Cantonese). Virtually every edible morsel was to be savoured: even, and especially, the silky strands around the eye, the tender flesh in the cheek, the eyeball. We would leave only bones and fins on the plate.</div>

<div class="line_en">As the months slipped by in Chengdu, I too learned to appreciate the bits of fish and fowl that I would have left on my plate in England or never seen at all (mostly, they are spirited away before the meat reaches the butcher's counter or the supermarket shelf). Feng Rui's stir-fried chicken miscellany was delicious, as was his twice-cooked pork, served in a sumptuous sizzle of chilli-bean paste and garlic leaves. The fish, whose journey from tank to table I had watched with trepidation, was steamed and then scattered with shreds of ginger and spring onion. He finished the dish with a libation of fizzing-hot oil that awakened the fresh fragrances of the onion and ginger, and then a slow, dark trickle of soy sauce. Lastly, Feng Rui placed a bowlful of winter melon and mushroom broth on the table. There was rice too, he said, if we wanted it later. We raised our chopsticks, and ate.</div>
