<div class="line_en">He heard the girls first, barking as they raced for home. The drum of hoofbeats echoing off flagstone jerked him to his feet, chains rattling. The one between his ankles was no more than a foot long, shortening his stride to a shuffle. It was hard to move quickly that way, but he tried as best he could, hopping and clanking from his pallet. Ramsay Bolton had returned and would want his Reek on hand to serve him.</div>

<div class="line_en">Outside, beneath a cold autumnal sky, the hunters were pouring through the gates. Ben Bones led the way, with the girls baying and barking all around him. Behind came Skinner, Sour Alyn, and Damon Dance-for-Me with his long greased whip, then the Walders riding the grey colts Lady Dustin had given them. His lordship himself rode Blood, a red stallion with a temper to match his own. He was laughing. That could be very good or very bad, Reek knew.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="外面，在寒冷的秋日下，猎人们正从大门涌进。本·博恩斯带路，女孩们在他周围狂吠。后面是斯金纳、酸溜溜的阿林和达蒙，他挥舞着他那抹油的长鞭子为我跳舞，然后沃尔德一家骑着达斯汀夫人送给他们的灰色小马。他的贵族本人骑一匹红色的种马，脾气和他自己的相匹配。他在笑。这可能很好，也可能很糟糕，臭佬知道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The dogs were on him before he could puzzle out which, drawn to his scent. The dogs were fond of Reek; he slept with them oft as not, and sometimes Ben Bones let him share their supper. The pack raced across the flagstones barking, circling him, jumping up to lick his filthy face, nipping at his legs. Helicent caught his left hand between her teeth and worried it so fiercely Reek feared he might lose two more fingers. Red Jeyne slammed into his chest and knocked him off his feet. She was lean, hard muscle, where Reek was loose, grey skin and brittle bones, a white-haired starveling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他还没来得及猜出是哪只狗，就被他的气味吸引住了。狗喜欢臭味，他经常和它们睡觉，有时本·博恩斯让他分享他们的晚餐。狗群在石板上狂吠着，围着他转，跳起来舔他的脏脸，咬他的腿。赫利森特用牙齿咬住了他的左手，他非常担心，臭佬担心自己会再失去两个手指。红珍妮猛击他的胸膛，把他打倒在地。她身材瘦削，肌肉结实，皮肤灰白，骨骼脆弱，一头白发，饥肠辘辘。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The riders were dismounting by the time he pushed Red Jeyne off and struggled to his knees. Two dozen horsemen had gone out and two dozen had returned, which meant the search had been a failure. That was bad. Ramsay did not like the taste of failure. He will want to hurt someone.</div>

<div class="line_en">Ramsay Bolton was attired as befit the lord of the Hornwood and heir to the Dreadfort. His mantle was stitched together from wolfskins and clasped against the autumn chill by the yellowed teeth of the wolf's head on his right shoulder. On one hip he wore a falchion, its blade as thick and heavy as a cleaver; on the other a long dagger and a small curved flaying knife with a hooked point and a razor-sharp edge. All three blades had matched hilts of yellow bone. "Reek," his lordship called down from Blood's high saddle, "you stink. I can smell you clear across the yard."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="拉姆齐·博尔顿打扮得很适合霍恩伍德之主和恐怖堡的继承人。他的披风是用狼皮缝在一起的，用他右肩上那颗发黄的狼头牙齿紧紧地扣在秋日的寒意中。在一个臀部上，他戴着一把镰刀，它的刀刃像一把切肉刀一样厚而重；另一个臀部上有一把长匕首和一把弯曲的小剥皮刀，刃口锋利。三把刀的剑柄都是黄骨的。“臭味，”老爷从马鞍上喊道，“你真臭。隔着院子我都能闻到你的气味。”">查看中文翻译</div>

The head struck his maimed hands, bounced away from the stumps of his fingers, and landed at his feet, raining maggots. It was so crusted with dried blood as to be unrecognizable.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在链子、脚镣和他丢失的手指之间，臭佬比他知道自己的名字之前更加笨拙。头撞在他残废的手上，从指尖上弹开，落在他的脚边，落满了蛆虫。它被干涸的血迹覆盖得面目全非。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Lord Snow. Reek nodded, his chains clinking as he wrestled with Blood's saddle straps. By any name, Ramsay's no man to be around when he is in a rage. Or when he's not. "Did you find your cousins, my lord?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯诺大人。臭佬点点头，他的铁链叮当作响，他与血的马鞍带搏斗。不管怎么说，拉姆齐在生气的时候都不是个好男人。或者他不在的时候。“你找到你的表亲了吗，大人？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The riders had been sixteen days on the hunt, with only hard bread and salt beef to eat, aside from the occasional stolen kid, so that night Lord Ramsay commanded that a feast be laid to celebrate his return to Barrow-ton. Their host, a grizzled one-armed petty lord by the name of Harwood Stout, knew better than to refuse him, though by now his larders must be well nigh exhausted. Reek had heard Stout's servants muttering at how the Bastard and his men were eating through the winter stores. "He'll bed Lord Eddard's little girl, they say," Stout's cook complained when she did not know that Reek was listening, "but we're the ones who'll be fucked when the snows come, you mark my words."</div>

<div class="line_en">Yet Lord Ramsay had decreed a feast, so feast they must. Trestle tables were set up in Stout's hall, an ox was slaughtered, and that night as the sun went down the empty-handed hunters ate roasts and ribs, barley bread, a mash of carrots and pease, washing it all down with prodigious quantities of ale.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，拉姆齐勋爵已经定了一个节日，所以他们必须举行盛宴。斯托特的大厅里搭建了栈桥，一头牛被宰杀了，那天晚上太阳下山的时候，猎人们两手空空地吃着烤肉、排骨、大麦面包、胡萝卜和豌豆泥，用大量的麦芽酒把它们洗掉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The fight did not end until their host's dog was dead. Stout's old hound never stood a mummer's chance. He had been one against two, and Ramsay's bitches were young, strong, and savage. Ben Bones, who liked the dogs better than their master, had told Reek they were all named after peasant girls Ramsay had hunted, raped, and killed back when he'd still been a bastard, running with the first Reek. "The ones who give him good sport, anywise. The ones who weep and beg and won't run don't get to come back as bitches." The next litter to come out of the Dreadfort's kennels would include a Kyra, Reek did not doubt. "He's trained 'em to kill wolves as well," Ben Bones had confided. Reek said nothing. He knew which wolves the girls were meant to kill, but he had no wish to watch the girls fighting over his severed toe.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="直到主人的狗死了，这场战斗才结束。斯托特的老猎犬一点机会也没有。他曾经是一对二，拉姆齐的母狗们年轻、强壮、野蛮。本·博恩斯比他们的主人更喜欢这些狗，他告诉臭佬，这些狗都是以拉姆齐在他还是个恶棍的时候，猎杀、强奸和杀戮的农家女孩的名字命名的，他和第一只臭虫一起奔跑。“不管怎样，那些给他带来快乐的人。那些哭泣乞求而不愿逃跑的人不会再像婊子一样回来了。”下一个从恐怖堡的狗窝里出来的狗窝里会有一只凯拉，臭佬毫不怀疑。“他训练他们也能杀死狼，”本·博恩斯曾透露。臭佬什么也没说。他知道女孩们要杀哪只狼，但他不想看到女孩们为了他被割断的脚趾而打架。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It fell to Little Walder to keep Lord Ramsay's cup filled, whilst Big Walder poured for the others at the high table. Reek was chained up beside the doors lest his odor put the feasters off their appetites. He would eat later, off whatever scraps Lord Ramsay thought to send him. The dogs enjoyed the run of the hall, however, and provided the night's best entertainment, when Maude and Grey Jeyne tore into one of Lord Stout's hounds over an especially meaty bone that Will Short had tossed them. Reek was the only man in the hall who did not watch the three dogs fight. He kept his eyes on Ramsay Bolton.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小瓦尔德负责为拉姆齐勋爵斟酒，而大沃尔德则为高桌上的其他人倒了一杯。臭佬被锁在门边，以免他的气味影响他们的食欲。他以后会吃东西，不管拉姆齐勋爵想送他什么东西。然而，当莫德和格雷·珍妮为了威尔·肖特扔给他们的一根特别多肉的骨头而撕咬斯托特勋爵的一只猎犬时，这两条狗还是享受了这一晚最好的娱乐。臭佬是大厅里唯一一个不看三条狗打架的人。他一直盯着拉姆齐·博尔顿。">查看中文翻译</div>

A sudden silence seized the feasters… all but Lord Ramsay, who tossed aside the bone he had been gnawing, wiped his mouth on his sleeve, smiled a greasy, wet-lipped smile, and said, "Father."</div>

The smell was something he was born with. A curse, the smallfolk said. The gods had made him stink so that men would know his soul was rotting. My old maester insisted it was a sign of sickness, yet the boy was otherwise as strong as a young bull. No one could stand to be near him, so he slept with the pigs… until the day that Ramsay's mother appeared at my gates to demand that I provide a servant for my bastard, who was growing up wild and unruly. I gave her Reek. It was meant to be amusing, but he and Ramsay became inseparable. I do wonder, though… was it Ramsay who corrupted Reek, or Reek Ramsay?"

Even the riding part is wrong. I was hunting a fox along the Weeping Water when I chanced upon a mill and saw a young woman washing clothes in the stream. The old miller had gotten himself a new young wife, a girl not half his age. She was a tall, willowy creature, very healthy-looking. Long legs and small firm breasts, like two ripe plums. Pretty, in a common sort of way. The moment that I set eyes on her I wanted her. Such was my due. The maesters will tell you that King Jaehaerys abolished the lord's right to the first night to appease his shrewish queen, but where the old gods rule, old customs linger. The Umbers keep the first night too, deny it as they may. Certain of the mountain clans as well, and on Skagos… well, only heart trees ever see half of what they do on Skagos.</div>

I should've had the mother whipped and thrown her child down a well… but the babe did have my eyes. She told me that when her dead husband's brother saw those eyes, he beat her bloody and drove her from the mill. That annoyed me, so I gave her the mill and had the brother's tongue cut out, to make certain he did not go running to Winterfell with tales that might disturb Lord Rickard.
