<div class="line_en">"Cannot be helped," my mother said when I was fifteen and had vigorously denied that I had any Chinese whatsoever below my skin. I was a sophomore at Galileo High in San Francisco, and all my Caucasian friends agreed: I was about as Chinese as they were. But my mother had studied at a famous nursing school in Shanghai, and she said she knew all about genetics. So there was no doubt in her mind, whether I agreed or not: Once you are born Chinese, you cannot help but feel and think Chinese.</div>

<div class="line_en">And when she said this, I saw myself transforming like a werewolf, a mutant tag of DNA suddenly triggered, replicating itself insidiously into a syndrome, a cluster of telltale Chinese behaviors, all those things my mother did to embarrass me -- haggling with store owners, pecking her mouth with a toothpick in public, being color-blind to the fact that lemon yellow and pale pink are not good combinations for winter clothes.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这样的话让我恼怒、生气。可待我母亲真的显出典型的中国行为时：如与店主喋喋不休地讨价还价，还有，当着众人剔牙撅嘴，对柠檬黄与淡粉红的不协调的搭配等等。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We are first going to Guangzhou, my seventy-two-year-old father, Canning Woo, and I, where we will visit his aunt, whom he has not seen since he was ten years old. And I don't know whether it's the prospect of seeing his aunt or if it's because he's back in China, but now he looks like he's a young boy, so innocent and happy I want to button his sweater and pat his head. We are sitting across from each other, separated by a little table with two cold cups of tea. For the first time I can ever remember, my father has tears in his eyes, and all he is seeing out the train window is a sectioned field of yellow, green, and brown, a narrow canal flanking the tracks, low rising hills, and three people in blue jackets riding an ox-driven cart on this early October morning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们的第一站是广州。我的七十二岁的父亲吴坎宁，将去广州拜望她的姑母。从十岁离开他姑母以后，他就再也没见过她。我不知是因为急于与姑母见面，还是因为回到了中国，七十二岁的父亲像个小男孩一样，激动得坐立不安。他显得如此地天真快乐，令我觉得简直要上去拍拍他额头和替他扣好纽扣似的。我们面对面隔着张小茶几坐着，桌上置着两杯冷茶。这是第一次，我看见父亲泪眼盈盈。在窗外，可以看见被小心地切割成一块一块的，整齐的黄绿色的耕地，狭狭的沟渠，像晶莹的饰带一样，缓缓流过。村路上，三个穿着蓝外套的人影，坐在慢慢走着的牛车上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And it was only this year that someone found them and wrote with this joyful news. A letter came from Shanghai, addressed to my mother. When I first heard about this, that they were alive, I imagined my identical sisters transforming from little babies into six-year-old girls. In my mind, they were seated next to each other at a table, taking turns with the fountain pen. One would write a neat row of characters: Dearest Mama. We are alive. She would brush back her wispy bangs and hand the other sister the pen, and she would write: Come get us. Please hurry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="直至今年得到了她们的讯息后，我才知道她们还活着。这时，这对婴儿在我印象中，变成一对五六岁的小女孩。她们并肩坐在桌子边，轮流用毛笔写出一行行整齐的中国字：最最亲爱的妈妈，我们都活着，赶快把我们带走吧！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In less than three hours, we will be in Guangzhou, which my guidebook tells me is how one properly refers to Canton these days. It seems all the cities I have heard of, except Shanghai, have changed their spellings. I think they are saying China has changed in other ways as well. Chungking is Chongqing. And Kweilin is Guilin. I have looked these names up, because after we see my father's aunt in Guangzhou, we will catch a plane to Shanghai, where I will meet my two half-sisters for the first time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="三小时火车后，我们抵达广州。除了上海这个城市的名称没有改变拼法外，几乎中国所有城市的名称的拼法都改变了。我想这本身也就意味着，中国在各方面都改变了。在广州与爸爸的姑母见过面后，我们将赶乘飞机会上海，在那里，我将与我的两个同母异父的姐姐见面。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They are my mother's twin daughters from her first marriage, little babies she was forced to abandon on a road as she was fleeing Kweilin for Chungking in 1944. That was all my mother had told me about these daughters, so they had remained babies in my mind, all these years, sitting on the side of a road, listening to bombs whistling in the distance while sucking their patient red thumbs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她们是我母亲与她前夫所生的一对双胞胎。在战乱时从桂林出逃到重庆的途中，她不得不把她们丢弃在路上，那是1944年抗战时期。妈曾经和我讲述过这件事，因此我对她们的印象还是一对嗷嗷待哺的婴儿。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Of course they could not know that my mother had died three months before, suddenly, when a blood vessel in her brain burst. One minute she was talking to my father, complaining about the tenants upstairs, scheming how to evict them under the pretense that relatives from China were moving in. The next minute she was holding her head, her eyes squeezed shut, groping for the sofa, and then crumpling softly to the floor with fluttering hands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，她们不会想到，妈妈在三个月前已经故世了。很突然地，血管爆裂而死的。去世前一分钟，她还在向父亲抱怨着楼上的房客，马上她就紧抱着头部大声呻吟，接着就跌在地上再也没有爬起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And the letter had broken my father's heart so much -- these daughters calling my mother from another life he never knew -- that he gave the letter to my mother's old friend Auntie Lindo and asked her to write back and tell my sisters, in the gentlest way possible, that my mother was dead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这封信很伤了父亲的心——他从未想到，在那另一个陌生的完全不同的世界里，也会有人叫他的妻子为“妈妈”——他把信给了妈的老朋友琳达姨看，并请她给这两个上海女儿写封回信，用尽可能婉转的口气告诉她们母亲的死讯。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So my father had been the first one to open the letter, a long letter it turned out. And they did call her Mama. They said they always revered her as their true mother. They kept a framed picture of her. They told her about their life, from the time my mother last saw them on the road leaving Kweilin to when they were finally found.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因此上海来信是我父亲拆开的。这是一封长信，她们称她妈妈，她们甚至还保留了她的一张照片。在信上，她们详细讲述了从桂林与母亲失散后至今的情况。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But instead Auntie Lindo took the letter to the Joy Luck Club and discussed with Auntie Ying and Auntie An-mei what should be done, because they had known for many years about my mother's search for her twin daughters, her endless hope. Auntie Lindo and the others cried over this double tragedy, of losing my mother three months before, and now again. And so they couldn't help but think of some miracle, some possible way of reviving her from the dead, so my mother could fulfill her dream.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="琳达姨把这封上海来信带到喜福会里，与映映姨和安梅姨商量。因为她们知道，多年来，我妈一直竭力在打听这两个女儿的下落，这是她朝思暮想，铭心刻骨要想实现的事。因此，她们觉得一定要为此做些什么，来慰抚她们的老朋友的亡灵。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So this is what they wrote to my sisters in Shanghai: "Dearest Daughters, I too have never forgotten you in my memory or in my heart. I never gave up hope that we would see each other again in a joyous reunion. I am only sorry it has been too long. I want to tell you everything about my life since I last saw you. I want to tell you this when our family comes to see you in China…" They signed it with my mother's name.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因此，她们这样给我的上海姐姐们写着：“最最亲爱的女儿们，我无时无刻不在思念着你们，我从不放弃一丝努力，为了让我们能团聚。遗憾的只是，我们彼此等候得太长久了。现在，我把与你们失散后的我的经历，详尽地跟你们说一说。……”她们签上我母亲的名字。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"How can you say she is not coming in a letter?" said Auntie Lindo. "She is their mother. She is your mother. You must be the one to tell them. All these years, they have been dreaming of her." And I thought she was right.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“但是，你忍心在信上就跟她们说，她不能来了，她死了？”琳达姨说，“她既是她们的母亲，也是你的母亲。应该由你，把事实真相告诉她们。要知道，这么多年来，她们一直梦想着与她重逢呀！”我想她讲得是对的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"They'll think she's coming, then," I murmured. And I had imagined my sisters now being ten or eleven, jumping up and down, holding hands, their pigtails bouncing, excited that their mother -- their mother -- was coming, whereas my mother was dead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可她们还以为，来的是她们的妈妈！”我喃喃自语着。在我想象中，她们还是一对蹦蹦跳跳的十一二岁的女孩子，她们正满怀激情地等待着与母亲的重逢，然而事实上，母亲已经去世了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But then I started dreaming, too, of my mother and my sisters and how it would be if I arrived in Shanghai. All these years, while they waited to be found, I had lived with my mother and then had lost her. I imagined seeing my sisters at the airport. They would be standing on their tiptoes, looking anxiously, scanning from one dark head to another as we got off the plane. And I would recognize them instantly, their faces with the identical worried look.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="是的，我不知道，如果是母亲回去看她们，那一切会是怎样的一个场景。我也无法想象，当我与她们相遇时，一切又会怎样！她们会踞着脚尖在机场上焦虑地观望着每一个下飞机的黑头发，可我，一下子就会认出她们的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I imagined myself starting to say, "Sisters, I am sorry, I have come alone…" and before I could tell them -- they could see it in my face -- they were wailing, pulling their hair, their lips twisted in pain, as they ran away from me.

<div class="line_cn" title="我就会对她们说：“姐姐们，对不起，我是一个人来的……”然后无需我多说，她们就会明了实情了。她们会恸哭，痛苦不已，然后把我一个人扔在机场上回头走了，我只得怏怏独自一人又登机飞回旧金山。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, that must be Mama, no?" one of my sisters would whisper excitedly, pointing to another small woman completely engulfed in a tower of presents.

<div class="line_en">Before the train even comes to a stop, people are bringing down their belongings from above their seats.

And then we are caught in a stream of people rushing, shoving, pushing us along, until we find ourselves in one of a dozen lines waiting to go through customs.

<div class="line_en">I take out the declaration forms and my passport. "Woo," it says at the top, and below that, "June May," who was born in "California, U. S. A.," in 1951. I wonder if the customs people will question whether I'm the same person as in the passport photo. In this picture, my chin-length hair is swept back and artfully styled. I am wearing false eyelashes, eye shadow, and lip liner. My cheeks are hollowed out by bronze blusher. But I had not expected the heat in October. And now my hair hangs limp with the humidity. I wear no makeup; in Hong Kong my mascara had melted into dark circles and everything else had felt like layers of grease. So today my face is plain, unadorned except for a thin mist of shiny sweat on my forehead and nose.</div>

I kept looking up to where the house used to be. And it wasn't a house, just the sky. And below, underneath my feet, were four stories of burnt bricks and wood, all the life of our house. Then off to the side I saw things blown into the yard, nothing valuable. There was a bed someone used to sleep in, really just a metal frame twisted up at one corner. And a book, I don't know what kind, because every page had turned black. And I saw a teacup which was unbroken but filled with ashes. And then I found my doll, with her hands and legs broken, her hair burned off…When I was a little girl, I had cried for that doll, seeing it all alone in the store window, and my mother had bought it for me. It was an American doll with yellow hair. It could turn its legs and arms. The eyes moved up and down. And when I married and left my family home, I gave the doll to my youngest niece, because she was like me. She cried if that doll was not with her always. Do you see? If she was in the house with that doll, her parents were there, and so everybody was there, waiting together, because that's how our family was."</div>

We pass a public bus, with people jammed in so tight their faces are nearly wedged against the window. Then I see the skyline of what must be downtown Guangzhou. From a distance, it looks like a major American city, with highrises and construction going on everywhere. As we slow down in the more congested part of the city, I see scores of little shops, dark inside, lined with counters and shelves.

Mei Chang told them about the reward, but she swore she would refuse it. She loved these girls so much, she only wanted them to have what they were entitled to -- a better life, a fine house, educated ways. Maybe the family would let her stay on as the girls' amah. Yes, she was certain they would insist.</div>

<div class="line_en">Your mother and I stayed in China until 1947. We went to many different cities -- back to Kweilin, to Changsha, as far south as Kunming. She was always looking out of one corner of her eye for twin babies, then little girls. Later we went to Hong Kong, and when we finally left in 1949 for the United States, I think she was even looking for them on the boat. But when we arrived, she no longer talked about them. I thought, At last, they have died in her heart.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我和你妈是1947年离开中国的。我们曾回过一次桂林，又去了长沙、昆明……一路上，她每每看到与双胞胎差不多岁的女孩子，总要多打量几眼。最后我们来到美国，我想甚至在船上，她还妄想能找到她们，但待我们一到美国，她就再也不提她们了，我以为她已经死心了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When letters could be openly exchanged between China and the United States, she wrote immediately to old friends in Shanghai and Kweilin. I did not know she did this. Auntie Lindo told me. But of course, by then, all the street names had changed. Some people had died, others had moved away. So it took many years to find a contact. And when she did find an old schoolmate's address and wrote asking her to look for her daughters, her friend wrote back and said this was impossible, like looking for a needle on the bottom of the ocean. How did she know her daughters were in Shanghai and not somewhere else in China? The friend, of course, did not ask, How do you know your daughters are still alive?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可自从中国和美国通邮，她就往上海和桂林发信，打听孩子们的下落。我可一点不知道，那还是琳达姨跟我说的。但那时，好多路名都改了，许多熟人死的死了，搬的搬了，所以花了很多年才找到联系方式。当她找到一个老同学的地址，写信让她去找女儿时，她的朋友回信说这是不可能的，就像是大海捞针。她怎么知道她的女儿在上海而不是在中国的其他地方？朋友当然没有问，你怎么知道你的女儿还活着？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But every year, your mother wrote to different people. And this last year, I think she got a big idea in her head, to go to China and find them herself. I remember she told me, "Canning, we should go, before it is too late, before we are too old." And I told her we were already too old, it was already too late.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但你母亲依旧不放弃她的努力，直到最后，我觉得她是下了决心，亲自去中国找她们。她曾经跟我说过：“坎宁，我们该趁着还不太老之前回去一次，再过几年，我们就要走不动了！”我就跟她说，已经太迟了，我们走不动了！">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I just thought she wanted to be a tourist! I didn't know she wanted to go and look for her daughters.

<div class="line_en">Maybe it was your mother's dead spirit who guided her Shanghai schoolmate to find her daughters. Because after your mother died, the schoolmate saw your sisters, by chance, while shopping for shoes at the Number One Department Store on Nanjing Dong Road. She said it was like a dream, seeing these two women who looked so much alike, moving down the stairs together. There was something about their facial expressions that reminded the schoolmate of your mother.</div>

<div class="line_en">At the airport, I am exhausted. I could not sleep last night. Aiyi had followed me into my room at three in the morning, and she instantly fell asleep on one of the twin beds, snoring with the might of a lumberjack. I lay awake thinking about my mother's story, realizing how much I have never known about her, grieving that my sisters and I had both lost her.</div>

<div class="line_en">She quickly walked over to them and called their names, which of course, they did not recognize at first, because Mei Ching had changed their names. But your mother's friend was so sure, she persisted. "Are you not Wang Chwun Yu and Wang Chwun Hwa?" she asked them. And then these double-image women became very excited, because they remembered the names written on the back of an old photo, a photo of a young man and woman they still honored, as their much-loved first parents, who had died and become spirit ghosts still roaming the earth looking for them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她连忙追上她们，唤着她们的名字。起先这两个妇女还呆了一下，因为她们已改了名字了。但你母亲的同学还是一口咬定：“你们就是王春雨和王春花吧？”刹时，她俩都显得十分激动，因为她们都记得那写在照片后的名字，她们不曾想到，照片上那对新婚燕尔的青年夫妇，已变成阴曹地府的鬼魂，但他们还在寻觅着自己的孩子。">查看中文翻译</div>
