<div class="line_en">Crawling out of bed on a damp October morning, in my small shared room in the Foreign Students' Building of Sichuan University. My Italian roommate, Filomena, is already up and out. Sleepily, I pull on a padded jacket and look out of the window. As usual, the sky is a muffled grey ('Sichuanese dogs bark' -- in surprise -- 'at the sun', goes the old saying). Over the wall that is supposed to keep foreign students in and curious Chinese people out, I can see a row of wutong trees and, beyond them, the Brocade River, where a cormorant fisherman is trying his luck in the murky water. His birds, their great black wings flapping, have rings around their necks. When they catch a fish too big to slide down their constricted throats, they offer it to the fisherman, who drops it into his basket, and gives them a smaller fish in exchange. I watch, captivated by yet another of the endlessly fascinating little events that mark my daily life in Chengdu.</div>

<div class="line_en">When the cormorant fisherman has drifted past and I can no longer see his birds at work, I shower, dress, and go off in search of breakfast. I say good morning to the elderly watchman at the gate of the Foreign Students' Building, and wander out past a row of plantain trees. Students and lecturers on bicycles ride past me, ringing their bells. Laundry and birdcages hang on the balconies of the low-rise apartment blocks. Everything is softened slightly by the gentle touch of the Sichuan mist. The campus is a quiet, leafy place, an oasis of tranquillity in a city where the taxis honk their horns incessantly and the street vendors shout and clatter.</div>

<div class="line_en">Not far away, just behind the university offices, there's a snack stall, which I can find just by following my nostrils. The heavenly scent of guo kui, twirly flatbreads stuffed with minced pork, spring onion and Sichuan pepper, drifts out across the campus. They are made by an elderly couple who don't speak much as they go about their business. The woman kneads her dough and rolls it into balls on an oiled wooden board. With the heel of her hand, she smears each ball into a long tongue of pastry which she rubs with lard and a smattering of spicily seasoned pork. Then she rolls it up, flattens it into a round and passes it to her husband. After frying them golden in oil, he tucks the guo kui under the griddle, where they bake crisp at the side of the charcoal brazier. Eaten hot, they are crunchy and chewy and savoury, and the Sichuan pepper makes your lips dance and tingle. Could there be anything more delicious for breakfast on a damp autumn day?</div>

<div class="line_en">It wasn't food that originally lured me to go and live in China, or at least that's what I told myself. I was supposed to be researching Chinese policy on ethnic minorities. A year after my first visit to China in 1992, I had flown to Taipei for a two-month summer course in the Chinese language, and then spent a month travelling around Mainland China and Tibet. On my way home from Lhasa, I called in on the Sichuanese capital, Chengdu, arriving on one of those rare, balmy days when the sun shines brightly, only slightly blurred by the perennial Sichuan haze. With me I had the crumpled namecard of a Sichuanese er hu (Chinese two-stringed violin) player called Zhou Yu, whom I had met on the streets of my hometown, Oxford, spellbinding a crowd with his melodies. 'Look me up if you ever visit Chengdu,' he had told me. So I checked into the Traffic Hotel, hired a bicycle, and went off in search of him at the Sichuan Conservatory of Music.</div>

<div class="line_en">Zhou Yu was as warm and engaging as I had remembered. He and his exuberant wife Tao Ping, another musician, welcomed me as an old friend, and took me on a bicycle tour of the sights of the city. We went for a walk in the grounds of the poet Du Fu's 'thatched cottage', and then they invited me for lunch at a modest restaurant near the bus station. It was a single room on the ground floor of a timber-framed cottage, tiled in white like a bathroom, with a few tables and chairs and nothing to adorn the walls. Zhou Yu ordered some food, and we waited for the dishes to emerge from the tiny kitchen at the back, amid the sounds of furious sizzling. The room filled up with the most marvellous aromas.</div>

The cold chicken tossed in a piquant dressing of soy sauce, chilli oil, and Sichuan pepper; a whole carp, braised in chilli-bean paste laced with ginger, garlic, and spring onions; pig's kidneys cut into frilly, dainty morsels and stir-fried, fast, with celery and pickled chillies. And so-called 'fish-fragrant' aubergines, one of the most scrumptious dishes I'd ever tasted: the golden, buttery fried aubergines cooked in a deep-red, spicy sauce, with no actual fish but seductive hints of sweet and sour. This was Chinese food as I had never known it before. It was a revelation.</div>

<div class="line_en">A few months later, a colleague at the BBC suggested I apply for a British Council scholarship to study in China. She helped me devise a worthy plan to investigate Chinese policy on ethnic minorities, a subject that had interested me for some time. Filling in the scholarship form, I came up with various academically convincing reasons for basing my research in Chengdu. I wanted to avoid the expatriate centres of Beijing and Shanghai, so that I had a chance to immerse myself in Chinese life and the Chinese language -- never mind that Sichuan dialect is a notoriously distorted version of Mandarin. Then there was Sichuan's location on the fringes of Han Chinese China, near the borderlands inhabited by Tibetans, Yi, Qiang, and countless other minorities. It all sounded quite plausible. But as I filled in the boxes on the form and composed my personal declaration, I must confess that I was thinking also about sweet and spicy aubergines, of a fish lazing in chilli-bean sauce, of frilly pig's kidneys and Sichuan pepper. Fortunately, the British Council and the Chinese government agreed that Chengdu was a suitable place for me to study, and they gave me my grant, a golden ticket to explore China for a year, with no strings attached.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="几个月后，一位同事建议我申请英国文化委员会的奖学金去中国学习。她帮着我弄出一个很不错的中国少数民族研究计划，估计我对这个主题还能感一阵子的兴趣。填奖学金申请表的时候，我想了好些常驻成都做研究的理由，都是学术上的，很有说服力。我不想去外国人特别多的北京和上海，这样就能让自己真正融进中国生活、学习中文。哦，四川话是普通话的变种，变得七扭八歪的，没关系没关系。四川算是中国汉族聚集区的边缘，周围有很多很多少数民族聚居区，比如藏族、彝族、羌族，等等。这些理由听起来都是相当充分的。然而，我必须坦白，填着表格上那一栏栏的项目、编着堂而皇之的理由时，我心里想的是鱼香茄子、豆瓣酱红烧鱼、火爆腰花和花椒的香味。运气真好，英国文化委员会和中国政府也认为成都对我来说是个做研究的好地方，给我拨了奖学金。这真是张“金奖券”，能到中国去探索一年，还没什么附加条件。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the autumn of 1994, the foreign affairs office of Sichuan University held a meeting to welcome the new cohort of foreign students to Chengdu. We gathered in the main hall of the Foreign Students' Building, where a stern member of the local Public Security Bureau read us the national regulations on 'aliens', with a teacher translating into stilted English. We were told that 'subversive actitivities' would get us into trouble, and that if our offences were serious enough, we might be expelled from the country. When the policeman had finished, the teacher added that medical staff would soon be coming to the university to draw our blood, which would be tested for HIV. Given that we had all been required to have exhaustive physical examinations before entering China, including HIV tests, we were indignant (my own doctor had laughed heartily at the Chinese state's medical demands of a healthy young woman, especially the electrocardiogram). It was a reminder that, however nervous we might feel about going to live in China, China -- opening up gradually after decades of Maoist introversion -- was equally nervous about us.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一九九四年，四川大学外办给刚来成都的一群留学生开了个欢迎会。我们聚在留学生楼的礼堂，当地公安局派来个面相严厉的警官向我们宣读国家关于“外来者”的规定。一个老师操着生硬的英语做翻译。规定里说，不能从事“颠覆破坏活动”，否则会惹麻烦，情节严重者会被驱逐出境。警察读完了，老师补充说，很快会有医务人员来学校抽血，检查我们是否携带HIV病毒。入境中国之前，我们全都经历了冗繁严格的体检，包括HIV检测，所以听到这个我们都很生气（我自己的医生曾发自内心地嘲笑中国对年轻健康的女性入境体检太严格了，包括什么心电图）。这其实在提醒我们，不管我们对即将到来的中国生活感到多么紧张，这个经历数十年封闭后逐渐开放的国家其实也对我们感到紧张。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The protected enclave of the campus we inhabited was known by the Chinese students as the Panda Building, because it seemed to them that we were treated like some rare and endangered species. Our Chinese counterparts lived in concrete dormitories where they were crammed together, eight to a room, with no heating in winter and no air-conditioning in summer, and distant communal showers that were available only at certain hours of the day. We lived in carpeted twin rooms with heaters and air-conditioners, and every floor of our building had its own kitchens, washing machines and bathrooms. Our dining room offered à la carte Sichuanese food much better (and much more expensive) than that served in the Chinese students' canteen. There was a watchman at the gate of our compound, and an office from which the sinister staff of the foreign affairs office kept an eye on our activities.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们住的地方在学校可谓备受保护的一块“飞地”（4），中国学生称之为“熊猫楼”，因为在他们看来，我们所受的待遇就好像珍稀濒危物种似的。我们那些中国校友住在混凝土的宿舍里，八个人挤在一个房间，冬天没暖气，夏天没空调，洗澡的话要走很远，每天还是特定时间限时供水。我们住的是摆了两张床的双人间，铺着地毯，暖气空调俱全，楼里每一层都配有厨房、洗衣机和卫生间。我们的餐厅可以点菜，里面做的川菜和中国学生的食堂比起来要好多了（也要贵得多）。我们那栋楼门口有看门的，还有间办公室，外事办的工作人员总是注意着我们的一举一动。【注：（4）本国境内的隶属另一国的一块领土。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the mid-nineties, the expatriate community in Chengdu was tiny. We foreign students numbered about 120 in all. Besides us, there were just a few American consulate workers, foreign teachers and aid workers, and a mysterious businessman from Peru. The forty or so Japanese students at the university were cliquey and exclusive. The rest of us, Italian, French, Mongolian, Russian, Ethiopian, Polish, Jordanian, Laotian, Ghanaian, German, Danish, Canadian and American, lived sociably together.</div>

<div class="line_en">Everyone in Chengdu shopped in markets like this on a daily basis. There were no real supermarkets, yet. From time to time I would run into one of my teachers from the university, struggling through the crowd, bicycle basket overflowing with green onions, beansprouts, spinach and ginger, a recently killed fish hanging from the handlebars in a plastic bag, still twitching.</div>

<div class="line_en">But if we lived in luxurious isolation, we had only to step outside the dormitory to be overwhelmed by the hubbub of Sichuanese life. Just around the corner from the side gate of the university was a market overflowing with fresh and seasonal produce. Fish leapt and eels wriggled in tanks of water, ducks and chickens squawked in their pens. Vegetables and fruits were piled up in great bamboo trays: water spinach and bamboo shoots, garlic stems and bitter melons, seasonal treats like three-coloured amaranth, loquats, and 'spring shoots', the tender leaves of the Chinese toon tree. One stall sold a dozen different types of beancurd. Farmers sat on tiny stools behind woven bamboo baskets heavy with produce, ready to weigh them out by the jin or the liang with their old-fashioned, hand-held balances, and tot up the bill on an abacus.</div>

The squint-eyed old woman in white overalls who sat before her bags and jars of spices: blood-red dried chillies, whole and ground; dusky-pink Sichuan pepper. The handsome flower-seller, smart in a dark business suit, slumped in his tiny bamboo chair, leaning back against the brick wall in a peaceful sleep, surrounded by a sea of brilliant roses and carnations. When a customer appeared and roused him with a gentle word, his eyes would blink open, and he would smile good-naturedly, light a cigarette and take money for one of his rainbow bouquets.</div>

Then, not only the flower-seller, but everyone else too, seemed to be asleep. Rural women snoozed over their squashes and aubergines, cradling their heads in circled arms. Tomato and bean sellers drooped over crouched-up knees. The fishmonger lay back against the wall, snoring gently. And beyond the market, the entire city appeared also to be suffused with drowsiness. Rickshaw drivers lounged in their empty passenger seats, feet up on the saddles of their tricycles. Office workers lay down on fake leather sofas, sprawled like cats.</div>

<div class="line_en">Now that the world is besotted with China, it is hard to remember how marginal it seemed in the early nineties. No one, then, would have considered going to Shanghai for a glamorous holiday or shopping. Few British universities offered Chinese courses; the idea of Mandarin being taught in schools would have seemed laughable. In London, my friends saw my Chinese studies as eccentric, if not hilarious. Even to me, Mandarin seemed a fairly irrelevant language.</div>

<div class="line_en">Despite the immediate charms of Chengdu, I spent my first weeks there in a state of misery and confusion. I didn't really have a clue what I was doing in China. My life until then had been like a conveyor belt that had carried me, almost unthinking, from my academic hothouse of a high school to Cambridge University, and then to the BBC. For a long time I had nurtured the idea of becoming a professional cook, but I left university with debts, and the short-term BBC contract I took to pay them off led to the offer of a permanent post, which I lacked the courage to refuse. By my early twenties, I was stuck in a dry, academic job that didn't suit me at all, and exhausted by a daily commute from London to Reading. So when my colleague brought up the idea of a British Council China scholarship, I seized the chance to escape.</div>

<div class="line_en">From the moment I arrived in China, I was almost completely cut off from the rest of the world. Email and the Internet were, for the majority of people, no more than unlikely rumours; an exchange of letters with a friend in England could take several weeks. There were only three places in Chengdu where cross-continental telephone calls were possible, and, if you found one, the cost of a call was astronomical (you could host a dinner party in a restaurant for the price of three minutes' conversation with Europe). Outside the glitzy sophistication of the city's two international hotels, Western food hardly existed, and the only foreign cultural activity available was watching pirated videos in a row of illegal cinema shacks near the university.

<div class="line_en">My own supposed studies offered me little sense of direction. My Chinese was too poor for any serious academic research, and, besides, I had chosen a research subject fraught with political sensitivities. The books and journals in the university library were filled with propaganda -- fairy stories about ethnic harmony and the gratitude of the Tibetans for the benevolent overlordship of the Chinese state. University lecturers became twitchy when the conversation veered towards uncomfortable subjects, and tried to steer it back to the safety of platitudes. I didn't know how to begin my work. China was not the totalitarian state of my London friends' imagination, but neither was it open, and for a newcomer it was impossible to gauge the boundaries. Even the locals found it confusing. The juddering old framework of the state economy was falling apart, along with the political controls of the Maoist era. No one really knew the rules. The whole country, waking up after the nightmare of Maoism, was making it up as it went along.</div>

<div class="line_en">Socially and culturally, China was challenging, too. As outsiders, my fellow students and I were still unusual enough to be treated as freaks or celebrities. We were interviewed by journalists, and invited to give speeches about nothing in particular at prestigious events. Crowds gathered to scrutinise our most trivial actions, even buying a bus ticket. A simple bicycle ride across town would provoke a Mexican wave of attention, as passers-by dropped what they were doing to watch us, and shout out 'Hello!' or 'Lao wai!' (foreigner). People were almost unfailingly nice to us, but it was difficult living under a microscope, and it took months to begin to understand what was really going on.

<div class="line_en">And then there was the slow, insinuating lethargy of the place itself. Chengdu was a city where it was virtually impossible to have any plans, let alone fulfil them. Since the Tang Dynasty it had been renowned for its easy life, the fruit of a gentle climate and soil of legendary fecundity. The inhabitants of Chengdu didn't have to work particularly hard to eat well and enjoy themselves. Their city had a southern, almost Mediterranean feel about it. People there moved more slowly than they did in Beijing or Shanghai. They sat in teahouses all afternoon and evening, playing Mah Jong or cards, exchanging banter in the honeyed cadences of Sichuan dialect, with its long, drawn-out vowels and burred 'r's. 'Bai long men zhen' they called it, this leisurely Sichuanese habit of conversation. And the most expressive word in Sichuanese must be 'hao suanr' (good fun), said lazily, with a broad grin, the creak of a bamboo chair in the background. 'Those coastal people,' one taxi driver told me, speaking of the Cantonese and Fujianese, 'they are ambitious and hardworking; that's why they've been the first to get rich.

<div class="line_en">I wasn't the only foreign student finding it hard to concentrate. My classmates and I heard from friends in Beijing and Shanghai about tough attendance regulations at other universities; miss a few lessons in those places and you might lose your scholarship. But in Sichuan, nobody cared. A few of us, mostly those with prior experience of China, settled down to some serious study. Otherwise, one by one, gradually and inexorably, we all dropped out of our official classes. My roommate Filomena spent most of her time playing Mah Jong. A young Danish student, Sören, hung around in the park, learning martial arts from a frail, elderly master. Volker, a German who was taking a break from his successful career as a film production manager in Los Angeles, idled away his days and weeks in conversation. The rest played rugby, fell in love, got drunk, and went travelling, here and there.</div>

In the east, you have the refined and subtle cooking of the literati, who mused about the pleasures of eating in cultural centres like Yangzhou and Hangzhou (it is known as huai yang cai).

In this region, chefs apply seasonings with a gentle touch -- just a little salt, sugar, wine and ginger to enhance the natural flavours of their raw ingredients. Cooking is precise, intervention minimal: a steamed fish, treated lightly with ginger, green onion and soy; translucent shrimp dumplings; a stir-fry of slivered ingredients in which everything is perfectly crunchy or tender, according to its own particular nature.

<div class="line_en">They were eating spicy food in the Sichuan region at least as far back as sixteen hundred years ago, when the historian Chang Qu remarked on local people's liking for bold and interesting flavours. Go to Sichuan and you realise that this isn't so much a matter of choice as of environmental determinism. The Sichuan basin has a humid climate: in winter, a creeping dampness penetrates every layer of clothing; summers are insufferably hot and sultry, with the sun hidden behind a haze of mist. In terms of Chinese medicine, the body is an energetic system, in which damp and dry, cold and hot, yin and yang, must be balanced; if they are not, illness is sure to follow. And although the moist Sichuan air keeps the skin of the women soft and youthful, it can destabilise the body as a whole. Therefore the people of this region have, for as long as anyone can remember, felt obliged to doctor their diets with dry, warming foods to counter the unhealthy humours of the climate. Until the first chillies arrived from the Americas, however, the only warming ingredients they had at their disposal were a few ancient imports from Central Asia, and native spices like Sichuan pepper.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="四川地区吃辛辣的传统至少可以追溯到一千六百年前。东晋四川史学家常璩评论家乡人“尚滋味”、“好辛香”。来到四川你才会发现，这不算是他们自己的选择，而是跟“环境决定论”有关。四川盆地气候潮湿：冬天，暗暗的湿气会穿透每一层衣服；夏天则是不可忍受的闷热，阳光永远躲在一层蒙蒙的雾气后面。中医的传统理论认为，人的身体是一个能量系统，干湿、冷热和阴阳都必须平衡调和；要是不调和，就必然生病。盆地潮湿的空气将川妹子的皮肤养得吹弹可破、青春永驻，但也动摇了整个身体的平衡。所以，这里的人们从有记忆开始，就像尽义务般地进行自我食疗，吃干辣的热性食物，中和有些“调皮”的气候。不过，辣椒从美洲传入中国之前，他们手上少数可用的热性食材是中亚进口来的一些古老调料以及四川本土的调料，例如姜和花椒。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The first chillies were seen in China in the sixteenth century, when Portuguese traders, newly returned from South America, sailed their galleons into the eastern ports. The Chinese of the coastal regions admired the chilli plant first as an ornament, with its delicate white flowers and vibrant scarlet fruits. It was only later that they began to use the piquant fruits as a seasoning. Merchants took the chilli up the waterways of the Yangtze Delta to the central province of Hunan, and from there to Sichuan, a little further westwards along the river. It was in these two warm, humid provinces that the chilli found its spiritual home. They were all but waiting for it; there was a place ready in their medical and culinary cosmologies. Its blazing colour lit up the grey mistiness of their skies, and its fiery heat drove out the dampness in people's bodies, bringing a delicious equilibrium to their lives.</div>

<div class="line_en">The canteen in the Foreign Students' Building at Sichuan University was a dull place, serving food that was fresh but soulless. With our meagre allowances and the teeming market just outside, we scholarship students might therefore have taken advantage of the cooking facilities in the Foreign Students' Building and made our own food. Some did, like Areej, the young Jordanian woman who kept house for her husband Taizer and baby Motaz in a single room in the dormitory, but most of us were too lazy. Besides, we quickly discovered that the food available outside the campus was so thrilling and plentiful that it would have been senseless to waste our time fighting for space in the communal kitchens. So every day, at lunchtime, we trooped out to a favourite noodle shop and guzzled bowlfuls of noodles with a variety of toppings. In the evenings, we pitched up at one of half a dozen little restaurants in wooden cottages near the university. Our Chinese student friends found our constant dining-out extravagant, but to foreigners it seemed ridiculously cheap. A noodle lunch set us back a few kuai (30p), while one person's share of an abundant group dinner with plenty of beer rarely amounted to more than 12 kuai (about £1).</div>

We took our seats around a wok in which an inconceivably large mass of dried red chillies, Sichuan peppercorns and other spices were stuck in a thick, pasty layer of fat. A waiter bent down and ignited a gas flame underneath the table. As the wok warmed up, the fat began to melt, and soon the chillies were bobbing around in it. The waiter brought plates of raw ingredients: beef offal and mushrooms, beancurd and greens. We used our chopsticks to cook them in the fiery broth. Every morsel emerged from the pot in a slick of fiery oil, studded with spices; even a single beansprout came out embroiled with a mouthful of chilli.

<div class="line_en">A few cottages down, on the opposite side of the street, was 'The Italian', which was actually nothing of the kind. Named after a long-forgotten group of Italian students who used to frequent it, the restaurant served the usual Sichuanese food and became our favourite venue for special dinners and birthday parties. On such occasions we would take over one of its two rooms and feast at a table laden with dishes. We would drink copious quantities of spirits that seared our throats and gave us rotten hangovers and listen to Jay -- a Canadian English teacher -- make one of his speeches, which were always deliberately pompous, peppered with random phrases of Chinese, and side-splittingly funny, especially after a few rounds of the local firewater.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="往下走几家店，街对面是家所谓的“意大利”餐厅，其实根本不卖意大利菜。这家店以前有群意大利学生常来，所以用“意大利”命名，但那群学生早不知天涯何方了。这家店还是做四川家常菜的，并且成为我们吃大餐和庆祝生日最爱的去处。比较重大的场合，我们会订下两间包厢之一，点上满满一桌子的菜敞开吃一顿；还会喝很多很多的烈酒，喝得喉咙冒火、宿醉不醒。我们边吃喝边听同学杰伊，一位加拿大英语老师，发表他的演讲：他总是会故意语气浮夸，随意夹杂几个中文词汇，逗得我们哈哈大笑，特别是喝了几轮当地的白酒之后。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I quickly became a regular at the Bamboo Bar, one of the restaurants near the university that was known for its hearty flavours and friendly atmosphere. It was a simple place, housed in a ramshackle wooden cottage, but the food was sensational and I never tired of it. By six o'clock every evening, it was already noisy and jam-packed with people. Customers sat on low bamboo stools around square wooden tables, tucking into fragrant stir-fries and steaming soups. The waitresses, young peasant girls from the countryside who slept like sardines in the low-ceilinged attic upstairs, bustled around with bottles of beer. Po po ('Granny'), the owner's mother, presided over the abacus at a counter by the door.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我很快成为“竹园”的常客，就是学校附近一家馆子。那里菜的滋味丰富，店里气氛也很亲切。简简单单的一个地方，一个有点儿摇摇晃晃的小木屋。但菜实在太好吃了，我怎么也吃不厌。每天晚上六点，这里已经喧嚣吵嚷、食客满堂了。客人们围着方木桌，坐在矮矮的竹凳子上，埋头在香喷喷的炒菜和热气腾腾的汤之间大快朵颐。服务员都是农村来的年轻女孩儿，晚上就像沙丁鱼罐头一样挤在上面小阁楼矮矮的天花板下面睡觉。饭店里的她们都特别忙，拿着一瓶瓶啤酒在桌凳之间穿梭。店主的妈，大家都叫她“婆婆”，站在门口的柜台后面，手里摸着把算盘，掌控全局。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In those days the restaurants we visited didn't even have fridges, and the beer was kept cool by being stored in a bucket of water. Meat and vegetables were bought daily from the markets; if you wanted an ingredient the restaurant didn't have, one of the girls might be despatched to buy it outside. Fish and eels lived in tanks in the kitchens. And everything, apart from the slow-braised soups and stews, was freshly cooked. Hygiene inspectors would no doubt have blanched at the cooked offal sitting around in unchilled cabinets, the reusable wooden chopsticks, and the poor facilities for washing up, but we almost never fell ill.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那个年月，我们去的馆子连冰箱也没有，啤酒放在一桶水里保持冰爽。肉和菜都是每天去菜市场买的。要是你想吃馆子里没有的食材，店主可能就派个服务员跑一趟现买回来。鱼和黄鳝都养在厨房的水缸里。除了文火慢熬的汤和炖菜，别的全都是现点现做的。卤的内脏就放在没有制冷功能的柜子里。木筷子是反复使用的，洗碗筷的设备也相当简陋。卫生检查员看到这一切肯定会脸色发白吧，但我们几乎从没“病从口入”过。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On warm evenings we would drift down to the riverbank outside the university, where a rash of al fresco restaurants had sprung up under the wutong trees. We would sit for hours under their branches, sipping beer in the uneven light of hanging lightbulbs and candles stuck into the necks of beer bottles, nibbling pig's ear, lotus-root slices, and fresh green soybeans squeezed out of their pods. All around us, people lounged around in bamboo chairs, laughing and chatting in Sichuan dialect, shouting in excitement as they played hua quan, a noisy finger-guessing game that was all the rage. Cicadas hummed in the trees overhead.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="天气比较热的夜晚，我们沿着校外的河岸闲逛。河边的梧桐树下，一个个“坝坝馆子”（9）争先恐后地冒出来。灯泡挂在树上，灯光忽明忽暗；蜡烛插在啤酒瓶里，烛影摇曳闪烁。我们会在梧桐树下一坐就是好几个小时，大口喝啤酒，小口啃猪耳朵，咬一口脆生生的藕片，把新鲜的煮毛豆从豆荚里“噗”地挤出来。我们周围全是人，懒洋洋地躺在竹椅中，大声笑闹，用四川话摆龙门阵；有的还划拳（风靡一时的类似“剪刀石头布”的游戏），兴奋地叫喊着。头顶的树梢上蝉子不停聒噪着。【注：（9）即露天餐厅。四川话把平坦的空地统称为“坝子”，任何在坝子上举行的活动都可以叫“坝坝××”，例如“坝坝电影”、“坝坝舞”（广场舞）。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sitting in the Bamboo Bar, watching grand platters of fish and mysterious claypot soups being brought to neighbouring tables, wafting their aromas under my nose, I became frustrated. Two years of Chinese evening classes in London and two months of study in Taipei had failed to give me the most rudimentary tools for deciphering restaurant menus. The Sichuan university textbooks I'd encountered in my few weeks of class were deathly dull and totally impractical. Instead of introducing us to useful words like 'stir-fry' and 'braise', 'bamboo shoot' and 'quail', they had required us to learn by rote long lists of largely irrelevant Chinese characters: the names, for example, of the heroes and villains in the ancient epic The Three Kingdoms; the words for an ancient kind of chariot, weapon or musical instrument.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="坐在竹园里，看着大盘大盘的鱼和神秘的砂锅被端到邻桌，阵阵香味钻进我的鼻孔，心情真是郁闷。在伦敦上了两年的夜校学中文，跑去台北又学了两个月，我居然连点菜这种最基本的事情都做不好。这几个星期在川大看的课本真是无聊到极点，而且特别不实用。没有教我们“炒”、“烧”、“竹笋”、“鹌鹑”这些有用的东西，而是要我们死记硬背一长串根本用不上的汉字：比如三国时期群雄与奸人的名字，古代战车、兵器或者乐器的名称。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Learning Chinese characters is a painful process anyway; it nearly breaks you. They say that, to read a newspaper, you need to know two or three thousand, and that's only a fraction of the number of characters in existence. So you cram them into your head, writing them out, again and again, in rows of squares marked out on special paper, or on little cards that you paste to the wall or read over breakfast. Yet, however hard you try to keep them in your head, most of them fall out again, like flour through a sieve. It's a Sisyphean labour, thankless and frustrating, which is why so many foreigners who learn Chinese end up speaking it quite well, but largely unable to read or write. I resented wasting hours memorising the vocabulary of the classic romances, and so I stopped going to my language classes as well as my lessons on 'minorities history'. Instead I took a few private Chinese lessons, and spent the rest of my time hanging around markets and restaurants, or sitting in teahouses, poring over dictionaries and photocopies of local restaurant menus.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="学汉字怎么着都是个很痛苦的过程，特别是对于成年人，差不多要搞得你崩溃。他们说，要想读中文报纸，至少得认识两千到三千个汉字，而这不过是所有汉字中很少的一点点。你把这些字死记硬背塞进脑子里，一遍一遍地写，有时候在画了一排排田字格的本子上，有时候写在小卡片上、粘在墙上，吃早餐时反复诵读。然而，不管你多么努力去记，它们还是会偷偷溜走，跟筛面粉似的，仿佛一切都是徒劳，吃力不讨好，而且特别令人沮丧。所以有很多学中文的外国人，最后说得倒挺流利，但基本上一到读写就成了文盲。我一点也不喜欢花大量的时间去记背那些古典作品里的字词，所以我再也没去上过语言课和民族历史课。我上了几节中文私教课，剩下的时间就跑去菜市场和餐馆，要么就泡茶馆，一边翻字典，一边研究复印来的当地菜单。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ever since I was a child, I have loved to cook. After every family holiday in Europe, I tried to recreate foreign recipes that I had found particularly exciting. At university I spent one long summer vacation immersed in Turkish cookery. I had been invited to spend two months with a family friend, a Turkish porcelain mogul who lived in central Anatolia. As a young, unmarried woman staying in a Muslim family, I had little freedom to explore his old-fashioned hometown or the surrounding region, and spent most of my time at home with his extended family. Naturally, I gravitated towards the kitchen, and my diary filled up with recipes for stuffed vegetables, köfte and purslane salad. From my mother I had picked up the habit of guessing the ingredients and cooking methods of dishes in restaurants, picking up traces of herbs and spices, forensically analysing the food on my plate. By the age of eleven I already wanted to be a chef. But the conveyor belt of my education took me further and further away from food.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从小我就喜欢做饭。每年一家人去欧洲某个地方旅行之后，我都会努力去重现特别让我兴奋的异国菜。大学时代一个漫长的暑假，我整日都沉浸在土耳其烹调之中。当时是家里一个朋友叫我去跟他玩两个月。他是土耳其瓷器界的显赫人物，住在安纳托利亚中部。我这么个年轻未婚女子借住在穆斯林家庭里，几乎无法自由地去探索他老派的家乡或者周围的地区，所以大部分时间都和他那一大家子人待在家里。我自然而然地被吸引到厨房里，每天的日记里写满了各种菜谱，什么酿菜啊、烤肉饼啊、马齿苋沙拉啊。我妈在餐馆吃饭的时候，爱猜测各种菜里的食材调料以及烹饪方法，去寻找草药和香料的蛛丝马迹，像法医分析一样去拆解盘中餐。我也继承了她这个习惯。十一岁的时候，我已经有了做个大厨的理想。但后来我按部就班地接受教育，在这条标准传送带上离美食这一行越来越远。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Students who get good grades at school are not encouraged to run away and work in restaurants. I remember one middle-school teacher laughing at me, incredulous, when I told him of my ambition. So I carried on passing exams, working hard and doing what was expected of me. It was in China, thousands of miles away from home and almost completely cut off from my past, that I was able to do what I really wanted. Finally, I was able to admit to myself that I was no socio-economic analyst, not even really a journalist, but a cook. It was in the kitchen, chopping vegetables, mixing a dough in my hands or seasoning a soup, that I felt most completely myself. Growing up in Oxford, studying in Cambridge, working in London, I had been propped up by a string of academic and professional credentials that had seemed to define me in the eyes of other people. But in China none of that mattered. I was just one of a bunch of homesick and culturally disorientated foreigners, trying to find our feet in a country about which, despite all our studies, we actually knew very little. It took me some time to accept this, but in the end it was the best thing that could have happened to me.</div>

<div class="line_en">For someone with a natural curiosity about food, Chengdu in the mid-nineties was a kind of paradise. It was all there, under your nose. In the backstreets, people cooked dinner for their families on charcoal braziers outside their cottages. The aromas of chilli-bean paste, Sichuan pepper and jasmine tea hung in the air on warm autumn nights. The most humble shack of a restaurant would often be serving Chinese food better than any you could find in London. Almost everyone in Sichuan seemed to love talking about cooking and eating. Surly taxi drivers waxed lyrical as they recounted to me, in great detail, their favourite recipes. Middle-aged couples slurping their lunchtime noodles would reminisce about the great beancurd chefs of the past. And I remember once listening to a radio broadcast in which a young female presenter recited the pleasures available at various city restaurants in tones that dripped with sensuality and greed. She murmured her way through an endless litany of dishes, lovingly describing their flavour and textures ('Oh, the ox tripe, so crisp and snappy!'), her words interspersed with breathy sounds of appreciation and excitement. She could barely contain herself. And she was typical of the people I met. As a chef friend once said to me, Chengdu people have 'hao chi zui' -- 'mouths that love eating'.</div>

<div class="line_en">Within weeks of arriving in Chengdu, I was writing down my impressions of the food. Even on the first few pages of my first Sichuan notebook, dated September 1994, there are lists of fruits and vegetables on sale in the markets, and accounts of conversations about food. And once I had divested myself of my academic responsibilities, my casual food investigations took over my life. It was just irresistible. Every day brought new gastronomic discoveries: perhaps a street vendor specialising in a type of snack I'd never seen before, or a peasant scurrying along with baskets slung from a bamboo shoulderpole, bearing some unusual fruit or herbal tea. I leapt at every chance to spend time with Sichuanese friends and acquaintances in their kitchens. My friendship with Zhou Yu and Tao Ping, the couple whose hospitality had lured me to Chengdu in the first place, deepened. Now I went regularly to their small flat near the music conservatory for supper. Tao Ping's grandmother, a ninety-year-old woman who was still walking up and down twelve flights of stairs every day with bags full of ingredients from the nearest market, invited us over for a feast of dry-fried beans and braised duck with wild yam jelly. My private Chinese teacher, Yu Weiqing, welcomed me into her home from time to time for a slap-up dinner: she taught me just as much about cookery as about the Chinese language.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到成都几个星期后，我就开始记录对食物的印象。我在四川使用的第一本笔记本，最早的日期是一九九四年九月。就连那本子上的最开始几页，也都列满了市场里卖的蔬菜瓜果，还记录着关于食物的对话。卸下学术任务的重担之后，休闲随意的食物调查就成了生活的主题。我就是忍不住啊。每天都有美食上新的发现：也许是街上某个小贩，专门卖一种我从来没见过的零食；或者农民扛着竹扁担急急地赶路，扁担两头晃荡的筐子里有什么不一般的水果或花草茶。每次有机会进四川的朋友或熟人家的餐厅，我都跳着脚就去了。周钰和陶萍，一开始本来就是这对夫妇的热情好客吸引我来到成都，而现在，我们的友谊又加深了。我经常去他们位于音乐学院附近的小公寓吃饭。陶萍九十岁高龄的奶奶每天还要从十二楼爬上爬下，提着附近市场买来的菜给我们做饭吃。什么干煸四季豆啊、魔芋烧鸭啊，简直不在话下。我的一对一中文老师，余老师，时不时地邀请我去她家吃顿讲究的晚饭。她不止耐心地教我中文，也教会了我很多厨艺。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Sichuanese are famously warm and relaxed, as different from their buttoned-up northern compatriots as the Neapolitans are from the British. I lost count of the number of chance encounters that led to invitations to dinner from strangers. I spent a memorable afternoon chatting to a roast-duck vendor in a backstreet near the Minshan Hotel, as he primed his birds with malt-sugar syrup and vinegar, and then roasted them in a domed oven made from bricks and clay. We talked as the ducks roasted, and soon he was inviting me to dine in a restaurant where he had an interest. For years afterwards (until his duck shop was demolished by city developers), whenever I cycled past, he would rush out for a chat, and press into my hands a jar of some spicy pickle or fermented beancurd that he had been keeping for me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="四川人的热情和随性是出了名的。他们和自己沉默内敛的北方同胞相比，就像意大利人和英国人的区别。我偶遇陌生人就被邀请去吃晚饭的次数真是数也数不清。一个难忘的下午，在岷山饭店的后街，我跟一个卖烤鸭的人闲聊着。他用饴糖和醋给鸭子擦了身，然后放进一个拱形的砖土炉子里烘烤。鸭子一边烤着，咱俩一边聊天，不一会儿他就邀请我去他投了资的一家餐馆吃饭。之后的多年（直到开发商把他的烤鸭店给拆了），只要我骑着车经过，他就要跑出来跟我聊一会儿，往我手里塞一罐专门给我留的咸菜或者豆腐乳。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One public holiday, Zhou Yu and Tao Ping invited me to go with them on a trip out of town, to share a home-made hotpot with some friends. When we arrived, we went to the local market to buy ingredients, and then returned to the friends' apartment to set up a potful of spicy broth over a gas burner on the kitchen floor. Sitting around it on little stools, we cooked our own lunch, dipping into the pot strands of enoki mushrooms, ribbons of beancurd, sweet-potato noodles and crunchy pieces of tripe. There was a tangible shift in mood as the meal progressed. In the beginning we were lively and animated, but gradually a deep stupor overcame us all, and we drifted off and fell asleep on armchairs, sofas, anywhere. It was only later, after a long, blissful siesta had restored me to my senses, that I noticed the enormous poppyheads bobbing around in the broth.</div>

<div class="line_en">Actually, though, you didn't need poppyheads to unwind and lose your inhibitions in Sichuan. There was something in the air, in the dialect, in the people, and above all in the food: a warmth and a languor that melted away any English stiffness, like butter in the sun. My heart was clenched like a fist when I moved to Chengdu. I could barely communicate, except through food. But as the weeks drifted past, I felt myself softening. For the first time in my life I was freed of all duties and expectations; life was a blank slate.</div>
