<div class="line_en">Dragan Armansky was born in Croatia fifty-six years ago. His father was an Armenian Jew from Belorussia. His mother was a Bosnian Muslim of Greek extraction. She had taken charge of his upbringing and his education, which meant that as an adult he was lumped together with that large, heterogeneous group defined by the media as Muslims. The Swedish immigration authorities had registered him, strangely enough, as a Serb. His passport confirmed that he was a Swedish citizen, and his passport photograph showed a squarish face, a strong jaw, five-o'clock shadow, and greying temples. He was often referred to as "The Arab," although he did not have a drop of Arab blood.</div>

<div class="line_en">He had become fascinated with the security business. It was like war games -- to identify threats, develop counter-strategies, and all the time stay one step ahead of the industrial spies, blackmailers and thieves. It began for him when he discovered how the swindling of a client had been accomplished through creative bookkeeping. He was able to prove who, from a group of a dozen people, was behind it. He had been promoted and played a key role in the firm's development and was an expert in financial fraud. Fifteen years later he became CEO. He had transformed Milton Security into one of Sweden's most competent and trusted security firms.</div>

<div class="line_en">The company had 380 full-time employees and another 300 freelancers. It was small compared to Falck or Swedish Guard Service. When Armansky first joined, the company was called Johan Fredrik Milton's General Security AB, and it had a client list consisting of shopping centres that needed floorwalkers and muscular guards. Under his leadership the firm was now the internationally recognised Milton Security and had invested in cutting-edge technology. Night watchmen well past their prime, uniform fetishists, and moonlighting university students had been replaced by people with real professional skills. Armansky hired mature ex-policemen as operations chiefs, political scientists specialising in international terrorism, and experts in personal protection and industrial espionage. Most importantly, he hired the best telecommunications technicians and IT experts. The company moved from Solna to state-of-the-art offices near Slussen, in the heart of Stockholm.</div>

<div class="line_en">By the start of the nineties, Milton Security was equipped to offer a new level of security to an exclusive group of clients, primarily medium-sized corporations and well-to-do private individuals -- nouveau-riche rock stars, stock-market speculators, and dot-com high flyers. A part of the company's activity was providing bodyguard protection and security solutions to Swedish firms abroad, especially in the Middle East. This area of their business now accounted for 70 percent of the company's turnover. Under Armansky, sales had increased from about forty million SEK annually to almost two billion. Providing security was a lucrative business.</div>

<div class="line_en">Operations were divided among three main areas: security consultations, which consisted of identifying conceivable or imagined threats; counter-measures, which usually involved the installation of security cameras, burglar and fire alarms, electronic locking mechanisms and IT systems; and personal protection for private individuals or companies. This last market had grown forty times over in ten years. Lately a new client group had arisen: affluent women seeking protection from former boyfriends or husbands or from stalkers. In addition, Milton Security had a cooperative arrangement with similar firms of good repute in Europe and the United States. The company also handled security for many international visitors to Sweden, including an American actress who was shooting a film for two months in TrollhÃ¤ttan. Her agent felt that her status warranted having bodyguards accompany her whenever she took her infrequent walks near the hotel.</div>

<div class="line_en">Armansky was not altogether enamoured of this part of their business. It was troublesome and less lucrative. It put greater demands on the employees' judgement and experience than on their knowledge of telecommunications technology or the installation of surveillance apparatus. Personal investigations were acceptable when it was a matter of credit information, background checks before hiring, or to investigate suspicions that some employee had leaked company information or engaged in criminal activity. In such cases the pinders were an integral part of the operational activity. But not infrequently his business clients would drag in private problems that had a tendency to create unwelcome turmoil. I want to know what sort of creep my daughter is going out with… I think my wife is being unfaithful… The guy is OK but he's mixed up with bad company… I'm being blackmailed… Armansky often gave them a straightforward no. If the daughter was an adult, she had the right to go out with any creep she wanted to, and he thought infidelity was something that husbands and wives ought to work out on their own. Hidden in all such inquiries were traps that could lead to scandal and create legal problems for Milton Security. Which was why Dragan Armansky kept a close watch on these assignments, in spite of how modest the revenue was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="阿曼斯基对这块业务始终兴致不高，因为不但麻烦还无利可图。从事这类工作的员工需要的不是电讯技术或装设监视设备的知识，而是判断力与经验。如果调查事项是关于信用状况、聘请前的背景调查，或是调查某位员工是否泄漏公司机密或参与非法活动，是可以接受的。像这类案例，私调便算是营业活动中不可或缺的一部分。可是客户却常常牵扯出私人问题，而且可能制造不必要的骚动。我想知道我女儿在和哪个混蛋交往……我觉得我老婆可能有外遇……这家伙是好人，却交了坏朋友……我被人勒索……遇上这种人，阿曼斯基经常是直接拒绝。如果女儿已经成年，就有权利和任何混蛋交往；至于外遇问题，他认为应该由夫妻自行解决。这些调查工作背后隐藏着陷阱，很可能会爆发丑闻，让米尔顿安保吃上官司，因此阿曼斯基对类似的委托始终格外谨慎，更何况实在难以从中获利。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">On the contrary, her reports were in a class by themselves. Armansky was convinced that she possessed a unique gift. Anybody could find out credit information or run a check with police records. But Salander had imagination, and she always came back with something different from what he expected. How she did it, he had never understood. Sometimes he thought that her ability to gather information was sheer magic. She knew the bureaucratic archives inside out. Above all, she had the ability to get under the skin of the person she was investigating. If there was any dirt to be dug up, she would home in on it like a cruise missile.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="相反地，她的报告总是独树一格。阿曼斯基相信她天赋异禀。调查信用状况或警方记录，谁都办得到，但莎兰德很有想象力，总是能带回他意料之外的东西。她是怎么办到的，他从来也没弄懂，有时候甚至觉得她搜集资料的能力根本是魔术。官方档案她已背得滚瓜烂熟，更重要的是她能钻进被调查者的表皮底下，一旦发现任何值得挖掘的秘密，就会像巡弋飞弹一样朝目标前进。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The morning's topic was just such a personal investigation. Armansky straightened the crease in his trousers before he leaned back in his comfortable chair. He glanced suspiciously at his colleague Lisbeth Salander, who was thirty-two years his junior. He thought for the thousandth time that nobody seemed more out of place in a prestigious security firm than she did. His mistrust was both wise and irrational. In Armansky's eyes, Salander was beyond doubt the most able investigator he had met in all his years in the business. During the four years she had worked for him she had never once fumbled a job or turned in a single mediocre report.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这天早上的主题偏偏就是一桩私人调查案。阿曼斯基拉平裤子的皱褶后，坐到舒适的坐椅上往后一靠，带着狐疑的目光瞥向小他三十二岁的女同事莉丝·莎兰德。他想过不下千次：好像再没有人比她更不适合待在一家名气响亮的安保公司。他的不信任可说明智也可说不理智。在阿曼斯基眼中，莎兰德无疑是他在业界多年所遇见最出色的调查员，她为他工作这四年来，从未搞砸过一件案子或交出一份不人流的报告。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Salander had habits that sometimes drove Armansky to the edge of despair. In the case of the paedophile, she did not pick up the telephone and call Armansky or come into his office wanting to talk to him. No, without indicating by a single word that the report might contain explosive material, she laid it on his desk one evening, just as Armansky was about to leave for the day. He read it only late that evening, as he was relaxing over a bottle of wine in front of the TV with his wife in their villa on Liding?.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有时候莎兰德的某些习性几乎让阿曼斯基感到绝望。就拿恋童癖的案子而言，她没有打电话给阿曼斯基，也没有进办公室找他谈。没有，甚至连报告中可能包含爆炸性数据的事也提都没提，就直接在某天傍晚，阿曼斯基正要下班前放到他桌上。直到当晚夜深之后，他终于能轻松地和妻子在利丁粤岛上的别墅中边看电视边喝酒时，才将报告拿出来看。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her reports could be a catastrophe for the individual who landed in her radar. Armansky would never forget the time he assigned her to do a routine check on a researcher in the pharmaceutical industry before a corporate buyout. The job was scheduled to take a week, but it dragged on for a while. After four weeks' silence and several reminders, which she ignored, Salander came back with a report documenting that the subject in question was a paedophile. On two occasions he had bought sex from a thirteen-year-old child prostitute in Tallinn, and there were indications that he had an unhealthy interest in the daughter of the woman with whom he was currently living.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="凡是被她的雷达侦测到并写人报告的人可就惨了。阿曼斯基永远忘不了有一次在某企业收购案前，他派莎兰德对一名制药工厂的研究员进行例行性的查证。预定一个星期完成的工作，却拖延了好一阵子。四个星期了她毫无动静，提醒了她几次，她也置之不理。最后她提出的报告中附带证明那个被调查的人有恋童癖，曾两度在塔林向一名十三岁的雏妓买春，并且有迹象显示他对当时同居女友的女儿怀有歹念。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The report was, as always, almost scientifically precise, with footnotes, quotations, and source references. The first few pages gave the subject's background, education, career, and financial situation. Not until page 24 did Salander drop the bombshell about the trips to Tallinn, in the same dry-as-dust tone she used to report that he lived in Sollentuna and drove a dark blue Volvo. She referred to documentation in an exhaustive appendix, including photographs of the thirteen-year-old girl in the company of the subject. The pictures had been taken in a hotel corridor in Tallinn, and the man had his hand under the girl's sweater. Salander had tracked down the girl in question and she had provided her account on tape.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这份报告一如平常，标示附注、引述与资料来源，精准到近乎完美。前几页交代了调查对象的背景、教育程度、职业与经济状况。直到第二十四页，莎兰德才丢出塔林之行的炸弹，用她一贯枯燥乏味的语气说出他住在绍伦吐纳，开的是一辆深蓝色的沃尔沃。她在附录中提出详尽的证据数据，其中包括调查对象和那名十三岁少女在一起的照片。照片是在塔林某家旅馆的走廊上拍的，那人的手伸进女孩的毛衣里头。后来莎兰德追踪到这名女孩，还将她的说词录音存证。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The report had created precisely the chaos that Armansky had wanted to avoid. First he had to swallow a few ulcer tablets prescribed by his doctor. Then he called in the client for a sombre emergency meeting. Finally -- over the client's fierce objections -- he was forced to refer the material to the police. This meant that Milton Security risked being drawn into a tangled web. If Salander's evidence could not be substantiated or the man was acquitted, the company might risk a libel suit. It was a nightmare.</div>

<div class="line_en">However, it was not Lisbeth Salander's astonishing lack of emotional involvement that most upset him. Milton's image was one of conservative stability. Salander fitted into this picture about as well as a buffalo at a boat show. Armansky's star researcher was a pale, anorexic young woman who had hair as short as a fuse, and a pierced nose and eyebrows. She had a wasp tattoo about an inch long on her neck, a tattooed loop around the biceps of her left arm and another around her left ankle. On those occasions when she had been wearing a tank top, Armansky also saw that she had a dragon tattoo on her left shoulder blade. She was a natural redhead, but she dyed her hair raven black. She looked as though she had just emerged from a week-long orgy with a gang of hard rockers.</div>

Palmgren had appealed to him to give her a chance, which Armansky had, against his better judgement, promised to do. Palmgren was the type of man who would only take "no" as an encouragement to redouble his efforts, so it was easier to say "yes" right away. Armansky knew that Palmgren devoted himself to troubled kids and other social misfits, but he did have good judgement.</div>

He gave her straightforward research tasks and tried to give her guidelines on how to proceed. She would listen patiently and then set off to carry out the assignment just as she saw fit.

<div class="line_en">A more serious problem was that he could not be sure of his own feelings for the young woman. She was like a nagging itch, repellent and at the same time tempting. It was not a sexual attraction, at least he did not think so. The women he was usually attracted to were blonde and curvaceous, with full lips that aroused his fantasies. And besides, he had been married for twenty years to a Finnish woman named Ritva who still more than satisfied these requirements. He had never been unfaithful, well… something may have happened just once, and his wife might have misunderstood if she had known about it.

He had decent graduating marks -- there are copies in the folder. During his prep school days he studied music and played bass in a rock band named Bootstrap, which actually put out a single that was played on the radio in the summer of 1979. After prep school he worked as a ticket collector in the tunnelbana, saved some money, and travelled abroad. He was away for a year, mostly bumming around Asia -- India, Thailand -- and a swing down to Australia. He began studying to be a journalist in Stockholm when he was twenty-one, but interrupted his studies after the first year to do his military service as a rifleman in Kiruna in Lapland. It was some sort of macho unit, and he left with good marks. After military service he completed his journalism degree and has worked in the field ever since.

Millennium is generally viewed as critical of society, but I'm guessing the anarchists think it's a wimpy bourgeois crap magazine along the lines of Arena or Ordfront, while the Moderate Students Association probably thinks that the editors are all Bolsheviks. There is nothing to indicate that Blomkvist has ever been active politically, even during the left-wing wave when he was going to prep school. While he was plugging away at the School of Journalism he was living with a girl who at the time was active in the Syndicalists and today sits in Parliament as a representative of the Left party. He seems to have been given the left-wing stamp primarily because as a financial journalist he specialises in investigative reporting about corruption and shady transactions in the corporate world. He has done some devastating individual portraits of captains of industry and politicians -- which were most likely well deserved -- and caused a number of resignations and legal repercussions. The most well-known was the Arboga affair, which resulted in the forced resignation of a Conservative politician and the sentencing of a former councillor to a year in prison for embezzlement. Calling attention to crimes can hardly be considered an indication that someone is left-wing."</div>

He owns a co-op apartment that's paid off --700 square feet on Bellmansgatan -- and he has no loans or debts. He has one other asset -- some property in Sandhamn out in the archipelago. It's a cottage of 270 square feet, furnished as a summer cabin and by the water, right in the most attractive part of the village. Apparently an uncle of his bought it in the forties, when such things were still possible for normal mortals, and the cabin ended up in Blomkvist's hands. They divided things up so that his sister got the parents' apartment in Lilla Essingen and Blomkvist got the cabin.

<div class="line_en">Salander scratched her neck. Frode looked patient. Armansky wondered whether he might be mistaken or whether Salander really was unsure how to continue. The Salander he knew was never unsure or hesitant. Finally she seemed to make up her mind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莎兰德挠挠脖子。弗洛德表现得很有耐心。阿曼斯基则不确定是自己看错了，或者莎兰德的确不知该如何继续。他所认识的莎兰德从来没有不确定或迟疑过。最后她似乎终于下定决心。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It wasn't part of my assignment to look at the question of fact in the Wennerström affair, but I did follow the trial and have to admit that I was actually flabbergasted. The thing felt wrong, and it's totally… out of character for Mikael Blomkvist to publish something that seems to be so off the wall."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“检视温纳斯壮事件的真相并不在我的任务范围内，但我确实留意了整个审判过程，也不得不承认我真的大吃一惊。整件事都不太对劲，而且实在……以布隆维斯特的作风，根本不可能发表这么离谱的东西。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Armansky opened his eyes wide. In the years Salander had worked for him, she had never made a single personal comment in an investigation of an individual. Bone-dry facts were all that mattered to her.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Quite off the record, so to speak… I haven't studied the Wennerström affair properly, but I really think that Mikael Blomkvist was set up. I think there's something totally different in this story than what the court's verdict is indicating."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“就当我们私下聊聊……我还没有认真研究过温纳斯壮的案子，但我真觉得布隆维斯特是被人陷害的。我想这件事里头一定有什么和法院判决书所写的截然不同的东西。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“那么你认为发生了什么事？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I can only guess. Blomkvist believed in his story, but something happened along the way and the information turned out to be false. This in turn means that the source was someone he trusted or that someone deliberately fed him false information -- which sounds improbably complicated. The alternative is that he was subjected to such a serious threat that he threw in the towel and would rather be seen as an incompetent idiot than fight back. But I'm just speculating, as I said."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我只能推测。布隆维斯特相信自己的报道，但过程中出了差错，结果发现他得到的消息是错的。也就是说，消息来源是他信任的人，也可能有人故意提供错误情报——这听起来复杂得不可思议。另外也有可能是他受到严重威胁，使得他宁可被当成无能的笨蛋也不想挣扎反击，干脆投降。但我要再强调一次，我纯粹只是推测。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Everything in Blomkvist's background shows that he's a very careful reporter. Every controversial revelation he published before was always well documented. I went to court one day and listened. He seemed to have given up without a fight. That doesn't accord with his character at all. If we are to believe the court, he made up a story about Wennerström without a shred of evidence and published it like some sort of journalistic suicide bomber. That's simply not Blomkvist's style."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“从布隆维斯特的背景看得出来他是个非常谨慎的记者，他从前揭发的每件丑闻全都有凭有据。有一天我去法院旁听，他好像连努力也不努力就放弃了。这根本与他的性格不符。如果法院说的是事实，就表示他毫无证据便捏造出关于温纳斯壮的报道，然后像个自杀式人体炸弹一样发表出去。这完全不像布隆维斯特的作风。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The conversation had taken an unexpected turn, and Armansky was instantly on the alert. What Frode was asking was for Milton Security to poke around in a case that had already been concluded. A case in which there may have been some sort of threat to the man Blomkvist, and if they took this on, Milton would risk colliding with Wennerström's regiment of lawyers. Armansky was not in the least comforted by the thought of turning Salander loose in such a situation, like a cruise missile out of control.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这番谈话起了意外的转折，阿曼斯基立刻有所警觉。弗洛德是在要求米尔顿安保去刺探一个已经了结的案子。此案也许对布隆维斯特个人造成某种威胁，但如果接受委托，米尔顿恐怕就和温纳斯壮的律师团杠上了。阿曼斯基一想到在这种情况下让莎兰德像颗失控的巡弋飞弹一样乱窜，心里不安到了极点。">查看中文翻译</div>

Salander had made plain that she did not want Armansky to act as some sort of worried stepfather, and since their agreement he had been careful never to behave like one, but in reality he would never stop worrying about her.
