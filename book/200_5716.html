<div class="line_en">Dinner in the Great Hall that night was not a pleasant experience for Harry. The news about his shouting match with Umbridge had travelled exceptionally fast even by Hogwarts' standards. He heard whispers all around him as he sat eating between Ron and Hermione. The funny thing was that none of the whisperers seemed to mind him overhearing what they were saying about him. On the contrary, it was as though they were hoping he would get angry and start shouting again, so that they could hear his story first-hand.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Look, you don't understand what it was like after it happened," said Hermione quietly.

<div class="line_en">Rain pounded on the windowpanes as they strode along the empty corridors back to Gryffindor Tower. Harry felt as though his first day had lasted a week, but he still had a mountain of homework to do before bed. A dull pounding pain was developing over his right eye. He glanced out of a rain-washed window at the dark grounds as they turned into the Fat Lady's corridor. There was still no light in Hagrid's cabin.</div>

<div class="line_en">The common room was almost empty; nearly everyone was still down at dinner. Crookshanks uncoiled himself from an armchair and trotted to meet them, purring loudly, and when Harry, Ron and Hermione took their three favourite chairs at the fireside he leapt lightly on to Hermione's lap and curled up there like a furry ginger cushion. Harry gazed into the flames, feeling drained and exhausted.</div>

<div class="line_en">"How can Dumbledore have let this happen?" Hermione cried suddenly, making Harry and Ron jump; Crookshanks leapt off her, looking affronted.

<div class="line_cn" title="“邓布利多怎么能让这种事情发生呢？”赫敏突然嚷了起来，把哈利和罗恩吓了一跳。克鲁克山从她身上跳开，一副受了冒犯的样子。赫敏气愤地敲打着椅子的扶手，里面填塞的东西都从破洞里漏了出来。“他怎么能让那个可怕的女人教我们要呢？而且还在我们参加0WL考试的这一年！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="可是赫敏根本没听，她正眯起眼睛看着房间那头的角落，只见弗雷德、乔治和李乔丹正坐在一群看上去天真幼稚的一年级新生中间，每个新生嘴里都在嚼着什么东西，看样子是从弗雷德手里提的那个大纸口袋里拿出来的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">One by one, as though hit over the head with an invisible mallet, the first-years were slumping unconscious in their seats; some slid right on to the floor, others merely hung over the arms of their chairs, their tongues lolling out. Most of the people watching were laughing; Hermione, however, squared her shoulders and marched directly over to where Fred and George now stood with clipboards, closely observing the unconscious first-years. Ron rose halfway out of his chair, hovered uncertainly for a moment or two, then muttered to Harry, "She's got it under control," before sinking as low in his chair as his lanky frame permitted.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那些一年级新生就像被一把无形的大锤砸了一下脑袋，一个个在座位上昏了过去。有的扑通滑到了地上，有的只是瘫倒在椅子的扶手上，舌头伸得老长。在一旁观看的人多数都哈哈大笑起来，赫敏则挺起胸膛，大步流星地直冲弗雷德和乔治走去，这会儿他们正拿着带弹簧夹的写字板站在那里，仔细观察那些神志不清的一年级新生。罗恩的身体从椅子上抬起一半，迟疑地悬在那儿片刻，然后低声对哈利说：“她已经控制住了。”接着他把他那瘦长的身体尽量压得低低的，缩在椅子里。">查看中文翻译</div>

As Harry and Ron reached her, a loud shout of laughter sounded behind them; turning, they saw Draco Malfoy striding towards them, surrounded by his usual gang of Slytherin cronies. He had clearly just said something highly amusing, because Crabbe, Goyle, Pansy Parkinson and the rest continued to snigger heartily as they gathered around the trestle table and, judging by the way they all kept looking over at Harry, he was able to guess the subject of the joke without too much difficulty.</div>

So, whenever you need leaves or wood from a tree in which a Bowtruckle lodges, it is wise to have a gift of woodlice ready to distract or placate it.

So if you'd like to gather closer, take a few woodlice and a Bowtruckle -- I have enough here for one between three -- you can study them more closely.

<div class="line_en">"How come you didn't do it last night?" Harry asked, as Ron stared wildly around the common room for inspiration. Ron, who had been fast asleep when Harry got back to the dormitory, muttered something about "doing other stuff, bent low over his parchment and scrawled a few words.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你昨天晚上怎么没做呢？”哈利问道，罗恩漫无目标地在公共休息室里东张西望，寻找灵感。昨夜哈利回到宿舍时，他已经沉沉地睡着了。听了哈利的问话，他嘀咕了一句，像是“干别的事情了”，然后埋头在羊皮纸上划拉了几行字。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry left her office without a word. The school was quite deserted; it was surely past midnight. He walked slowly up the corridor, then, when he had turned the corner and was sure she would not hear him, broke into a run.</div>

<div class="line_en">He had not had time to practise Vanishing Spells, had not written a single dream in his dream diary and had not finished the drawing of the Bowtruckle, nor had he written his essays. He skipped breakfast next morning to scribble down a couple of made-up dreams for Divination, their first lesson, and was surprised to find a dishevelled Ron keeping him company.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他没有时间练习消失咒，做梦日记里一个梦也没有记录下来，护树罗锅的草图还没有画完，那么多篇论文一篇也没有写。第二天早上，他没吃早饭，匆匆忙忙地编造了两个梦，草草写下来，准备拿到上午第一节的占卜课上交差。他吃惊地发现罗恩衣冠不整，蓬头垢面，也在临时抱佛脚。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was another bad day for Harry; he was one of the worst in Transfiguration, not having practised Vanishing Spells at all. He had to give up his lunch hour to complete the picture of the Bowtruckle and, meanwhile, Professors McGonagall, Grubbly-Plank and Sinistra gave them yet more homework, which he had no prospect of finishing that evening because of his second detention with Umbridge. To cap it all, Angelina Johnson tracked him down at dinner again and, on learning that he would not be able to attend Friday's Keeper tryouts, told him she was not at all impressed by his attitude and that she expected players who wished to remain on the team to put training before their other commitments.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="对哈利来说，这又是很难熬的一天。变形课上他是表现最差的几个人之一，因为他根本就没有练习消失咒。午饭时间他不得不放弃休息，把护树罗锅的那张草图画完。这还不算，麦格、格拉普兰和辛尼斯塔教授又给他们布置了一大堆家庭作业，他根本不可能在当天晚上完成，因为他还要到乌姆里奇那里去进行第二次关禁闭。更糟糕的是，安吉利娜约翰逊听说他不能参加星期五选拔守门员的训练，就在吃晚饭的时候又找到他，告诉他说，她对他的态度很不满意，她希望每个打算留在球队的人都应把训练放在一切活动的首位。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"At least it's only lines," said Hermione consolingly, as Harry sank back on to his bench and looked down at his steak and kidney pie, which he no longer fancied very much. "It's not as it it's a dreadful punishment, really…"</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry opened his mouth, closed it again and nodded. He was not really sure why he was not telling Ron and Hermione exactly what was happening in Umbridge's room: he only knew that he did not want to see their looks of horror; that would make the whole thing seem worse and therefore more difficult to face. He also felt dimly that this was between himself and Umbridge, a private battle of wills, and he was not going to give her the satisfaction of hearing that he had complained about it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利张了张嘴又闭上了，随即点了点头。他也不明白自己为什么不想把乌姆里奇办公室里发生的一切告诉罗恩和赫敏。他只知道他不想看到他们脸上惊恐的表情，那只会使事情显得更加糟糕，因而也就更难面对。他还隐隐约约地感到，这是他和乌姆里奇之间的事情，是一场秘密的意志较量，他不想让她听到他在哭诉埋怨并因此而感到快意。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The second detention was just as bad as the previous one. The skin on the back of Harry's hand became irritated more quickly now and was soon red and inflamed. Harry thought it unlikely that it would keep healing as effectively for long. Soon the cut would remain etched into his hand and Umbridge would, perhaps, be satisfied. He let no gasp of pain escape him, however, and from the moment of entering the room to the moment of his dismissal, again past midnight, he said nothing but "good evening" and "goodnight'.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二次关禁闭和第一次同样痛苦难熬。哈利手背上的皮肤现在变得更敏感，很快就变红了，像着了火一样地疼。哈利觉得过不了多久，伤口就不会那样有效地愈合了。过不了多久，那些字就会深深刻进他的手背，乌姆里奇大概就会满意了。不过，哈利拼命忍着不发出疼痛的喘息，丽且，从他走进办公室直到乌姆里奇放他离去——又是午夜之后，他只说了两句话，“晚上好”和“晚安”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His homework situation, however, was now desperate, and when he returned to the Gryffindor common room he did not, though exhausted, go to bed, but opened his books and began Snape's moonstone essay. It was half past two by the time he had finished it. He knew he had done a poor job, but there was no help for it; unless he had something to give in he would be in detention with Snape next. He then dashed off answers to the questions Professor McGonagall had set them, cobbled together something on the proper handling of Bowtruckles for Professor Grubbly-Plank, and staggered up to bed, where he fell fully clothed on top of the covers and fell asleep immediately.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他的家庭作业现在已经到了不堪收拾的地步，因此他返回格兰芬多公共休息室后，尽管累得一点力气也没有了，但他并没有上床睡觉，而是打开书本，开始写斯内普布置的那篇关于月长石的论文。他写完时已经是两点半了。他知道写得很糟糕，但也没有办法，他必须交点东西上去，不然接下来就要被斯内普关禁闭了。接着，他匆匆回答了麦格教授给他们布置的几个问题，又在护树罗锅身上合适的部位拼凑了一些东西，准备拿去应付格拉普兰教授，然后才踉踉跄跄地上床睡觉，连衣服也没脱，囫囵倒在被子上，立刻就沉沉地睡着了。">查看中文翻译</div>

These were rather feeble rays of light, it was true, but Harry was grateful for anything that might lighten his present darkness; he had never had a worse first week of term at Hogwarts.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天有两件事情给了哈利一些信心。一是他想到马上就要到周末了，二是尽管最后一次到乌姆里奇那里关禁闭肯定会很恐怖，但从她办公室的窗户能远远地看见魁地奇球场，如果运气好，说不定还能多少看见一点罗恩的选拔情况呢。当然，这些都是十分渺茫的希望之光，可是哈利目前的处境一片黑暗，但凡有什么事情能带来一点点光亮，他都会感到欣慰。他在霍格沃茨还从未经历过比这更糟糕的开学第一个星期呢。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Friday dawned sullen and sodden as the rest of the week.

Vicky Frobisher and Geoffrey Hooper both flew better this evening, but Hooper's a real whiner, he's always moaning about something or other, and Vicky's involved in all sorts of societies. She admitted herself that if training clashed with her Charms Club she'd put Charms first. Anyway, we're having a practice session at two o'clock tomorrow, so just make sure you're there this time.
