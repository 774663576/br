<div class="line_en">Inside the Sistine Chapel, the camerlegno stood unwavering as he spoke. Five solitary words of astonishing disclosure. The entire assembly seemed to recoil in unison. The cardinals' accusing miens evaporated into aghast stares, as if every soul in the room were praying the camerlegno was wrong.</div>

<div class="line_en">The camerlegno's utterance seemed like it would hang forever in the air above them. Even in the camerlegno's frenzied eyes, Langdon could see pure conviction. Langdon wanted to disengage, tell himself he was lost in some grotesque nightmare, soon to wake up in a world that made sense.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="总司库的那句话彷彿将永远悬在他们上方的空中。即使在总司库狂乱的双眼中，兰登仍看得出他的坚信。兰登想摆脱这一切，告诉自己说他是陷在哪个怪诞的梦魇裡了，很快就会醒来，发现这个世界一切都清楚合理。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Langdon understood. This meant the information was probably true. The infamous "Devil's Advocate" wasthe authority when it came to scandalous information inside the Vatican. Skeletons in a Pope's closet were dangerous, and prior to elections, secret inquiries into a candidate's background were carried out by a lone cardinal who served as the "Devil's Advocate" -- that individual responsible for unearthing reasons why the eligible cardinals shouldnot become Pope. The Devil's Advocate was appointed in advance by the reigning Pope in preparation for his own death. The Devil's Advocate was never supposed to reveal his identity. Ever.</div>

<div class="line_en">Slowly, sadly, Mortati let the tale unfold. Many years ago, the Pope, when he was still just a priest, had fallen in love with a young nun. Both of them had taken vows of celibacy and never even considered breaking their covenant with God. Still, as they fell deeper in love, although they could resist the temptations of the flesh, they both found themselves longing for something they never expected -- to participate in God's ultimate miracle of creation -- a child. Their child. The yearning, especially in her, became overwhelming. Still, God came first. A year later, when the frustration had reached almost unbearable proportions, she came to him in a whirl of excitement. She had just read an article about a new miracle of science -- a process by which two people, without ever having sexual relations, could have a child. She sensed this was a sign from God. The priest could see the happiness in her eyes and agreed. A year later she had a child through the miracle of artificial insemination…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莫塔提忧伤地缓缓道出那个故事。很多年前，教宗当时还只是个神父，爱上了一位年轻修女。两个人都曾发誓要独身守贞，从没想过要违背他们和天主订下的圣约。然而，他们相爱愈来愈深，虽然可以抗拒肉体的诱惑，但两人发现自己都渴望著从没想到过的──参与上帝最极致的创造奇蹟──生小孩。他们的小孩。两人渴望得几乎受不了，尤其是她。然而，天主必须放在第一位。一年后，当挫折感达到几乎难以承受的地步时，她兴奋地跑来找她。她刚刚看到一篇文章，裡头报导一个新的科学奇蹟──藉著这个过程，两个人不必有任何性关系，就可以生出小孩。她感觉到这是来自天主的徵兆。神父看到她双眼中的快乐，于是答应了。一年后，她经由人工授精的奇蹟，生下了一个孩子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mortati now had tears in his eyes. "Carlo, this is why His Holiness has always had an affection for the sciences. He felt he owed a debt to science. Science let him experience the joys of fatherhood without breaking his vow of celibacy. His Holiness told me he had no regrets except one -- that his advancing stature in the church prohibited him from being with the woman he loved and seeing his infant grow up."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莫塔提现在双眼含泪。「卡罗，这就是为什麽宗座对科学始终有分感情。他觉得他受了科学的一份恩情。科学让他体验到为人父亲的快乐，却不必违背独身守贞的誓约。宗座当时告诉我，他一点也不后悔，除了一件事──他在教会中的职位愈来愈高，使得他无法和他所爱的女人在一起，也无法看著他们的婴儿成长。」">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="那一刻，总司库感觉到信仰之火在他心中逐渐黯淡。他站在祭坛上颤抖，米开朗基罗高耸的《最后的审判》框住他。他知道刚刚真正的地狱在他眼前一闪而过。他张嘴想讲话，但嘴唇哆嗦著，发不出声音。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Don't you see?" Mortati choked."That is why His Holiness came to you in the hospital in Palermo when you were a boy. That is why he took you in and raised you. The nun he loved was Maria… your mother. She left the nunnery to raise you, but she never abandoned her strict devotion to God. When the Pope heard she had died in an explosion and that you, his son, had miraculously survived… he swore to God he would never leave you alone again. Carlo, your parents were both virgins. They kept their vows to God. And still they found a way to bring you into the world. You were their miraculous child."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「你难道不明白吗？」莫塔提硬著嗓子。「这就是为什麽你小时候，宗座会到帕勒摩的医院找你。这就是为什麽他收容你，把你带大。他当年爱上的修女就是玛丽亚……你的母亲。她离开修女院抚养你，但她从未抛弃对天主的坚定奉献。教宗听说她死于一场爆炸，而且他的儿子奇蹟生还时……他向天主发誓，他再也不会抛下你了。卡罗，你的父母都是处子。他们都坚守对天主的誓约。但他们还是找到了一个办法，把你带到这个世界上。你是他们的奇蹟之子。」">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="在这个礼拜堂的四面墙内，时间似乎失去了所有意义。薇多利雅感觉到自己逐渐脱离了那股攫住所有人的惊呆状态。她放开兰登的手，穿过那群枢机主教。礼拜堂的门好像有几哩远，她觉得自己好像在水下行走……慢动作。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As she maneuvered through the robes, her motion seemed to pull others from their trance. Some of the cardinals began to pray. Others wept.
