<div class="line_en">Elizabeth shot an annoyed look at the bespectacled officer in army fatigues as he enumerated the various regulations he thought the approach she'd described fell afoul of. This was not what she wanted to hear. Shoemaker and the little military delegation he was leading had been invited to Palo Alto on this morning in November 2011 to bless Theranos's plans to deploy its devices in the Afghan war theater, not to raise objections about its regulatory strategy.</div>

The hard-charging general was open to pursuing any technology that might keep his men safer as they fought the Taliban in the interminable, atrocity-marred war in Afghanistan.

<div class="line_en">With his genial smile and his southern Ohio drawl, Shoemaker had a calm, self-effacing manner about him, but he could be direct with people when he needed to be. Theranos's strategy, which envisioned bypassing the FDA altogether, was a nonstarter, he warned Elizabeth, especially if she planned to roll out her devices nationwide by the following spring, as she had asserted to him. There was no way the agency would allow her to do that without going through its review process, he told her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他有着亲切微笑以及南俄亥俄州的长尾音口音，是个冷静、谦逊的人，但如有必要他也会单刀直入。他向伊莉莎白提出警告，Theranos企图采取完全绕过FDA的策略，是不可能成功的。尤其如果如同她所宣称，打算明年春天在美国全面推出设备的话，FDA绝对不可能未审核进程就准许她这么做。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Elizabeth disagreed forcefully, citing advice Theranos had received from its lawyers. She was so defensive and obstinate that Shoemaker quickly realized that prolonging the argument would be a waste of time. She clearly didn't want to hear anything that contradicted her point of view. As he looked around the table, he noted that she had brought no regulatory affairs expert to the meeting. He suspected the company didn't even employ one. If he was right about that, it was an incredibly naïve way of operating. Health care was the most highly regulated industry in the country and for good reason: the lives of patients were at stake.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伊莉莎白强烈不认同，引用律师给她的建议进行反驳。眼见她如此固执、防备心如此之强，休梅克很快就明白，继续争执下去只是浪费时间，她显然听不进任何抵触她观点的话。他环顾桌子四周，发现她竟然没有带法规专家与会，他怀疑这家公司甚至连法规专家都没有，如果他猜得没错，那这家公司实在天真到不可置信的地步，健康医疗是美国规范最严格的产业，背后的理由非常简单：人命关天。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In his eighteen-year career in the army, Shoemaker had come across a lot of people who seemed to think the military was exempt from civilian regulations and free to conduct medical research as it pleased. That was simply not the case, though this wasn't to say it hadn't happened in the past. The Pentagon tested mustard gas on American soldiers during World War II and Agent Orange on prisoners in the 1960s. But the days of unsupervised, freewheeling medical experimentation by the military were long gone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="十八年从军生涯中，休梅克遇过很多人总认为军队可免受民间法规的规范，只要喜欢就可进行医疗研究，事实并非如此。不过，倒也不是说这种事以往没发生过，二次大战时国防部曾在美国大兵身上测试芥子毒气（mustard gas），一九六〇年代也曾在犯人身上测试橙剂（Agent Orange），但军方进行这种无人监督、为所欲为实验的日子早已远去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">During the Serbian conflict in the 1990s, for instance, the Pentagon made sure to get the FDA's assent before offering troops deployed in the Balkans an experimental vaccine against tick-borne encephalitis. And only soldiers who wished to receive the vaccine were given it. Similarly, the army worked closely with the agency to make an investigational vaccine against botulinum toxin available to soldiers in Iraq in 2003. At the time, concerns were high that Saddam Hussein had stockpiled the lethal biological agent, and the promising vaccine, which had been developed by researchers at Fort Detrick, hadn't yet been approved by the FDA.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="举个例子，一九九〇年代塞尔维亚冲突中，国防部先取得了FDA的同意，才将仍在试验阶段的蜱媒脑炎（tick-borne encephalitis）疫苗，提供给部署于巴尔干半岛的部队，而且只有愿意接种疫苗的士兵施打。同样地，二〇〇三年陆军跟FDA密切合作，才让驻伊拉克美军有试验阶段的肉毒杆菌疫苗可施打——当时外界担心海珊（Saddam Hussein）囤积这种致命生物制剂，而狄崔克堡研发的疫苗却还没获得FDA许可。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Shoemaker told Elizabeth she would need to get something in writing from the FDA supporting her position if she wanted him to greenlight the use of her machines on army personnel. Her face conveyed deep displeasure. She resumed her presentation but gave Shoemaker the cold shoulder for the rest of the day.</div>

<div class="line_en">What was valid for vaccines was also valid for medical devices. If Theranos wanted to try out its blood-testing machines on troops in Afghanistan, Shoemaker felt certain that it would need to put together an IRB-approved study protocol. But since Elizabeth had been so adamant and he was also getting second-guessed by CENTCOM, he decided to bring in Jeremiah Kelly, an army lawyer who'd previously worked at the FDA. He scheduled another meeting with Elizabeth so Kelly could hear from her directly and provide a second opinion. They agreed to meet at 3:30 p. m. on December 9, 2011, at the Washington, D. C., offices of Theranos's law firm, Zuckerman Spaeder.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="疫苗如此，医疗设备也是如此。如果Theranos想在阿富汗的美军身上测试其血液检测机器，休梅克很确定Theranos必须提出一份获得IRB许可的试验计划流程。但眼看伊莉莎白如此固执，而他也会受到中央司令部事后调查，所以他决定引进耶利米．凯利（Jeremiah Kelly，曾服务于FDA的陆军律师）的意见。休梅克跟伊莉莎白安排了另一次会议时间，以便凯利能直接听取她的说法并提供第二意见。他们同意于二〇一一年十二月九日下午三点半见面，地点在华盛顿特区，Theranos的律师事务所Zuckerman Spaeder办公室。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In both instances, the army consulted an institutional review board, or IRB -- a committee within the military that monitors medical research to ensure that it is conducted safely and ethically. If the IRB deems that a proposed study doesn't pose significant risks, the FDA will usually allow it to go forward, provided it's carried out under a strict protocol the committee has reviewed and approved.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="上述两例中，陆军都咨询过人体试验委员会（IRB）——军方内部的委员会，负责监督医疗研究，确保研究在安全、符合伦理的条件下进行。只要经过IRB认定没有重大风险的研究，FDA通常会放行，前提是必须根据IRB审核通过的严谨流程来进行。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Elizabeth came to the meeting alone with a single-page document outlining the same regulatory approach Shoemaker had heard her present a few weeks before in Palo Alto. He had to give it to her: the structure she laid out was creative. One might even call it sneaky.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="伊莉莎白独自赴会，带的文档只有一页，内容概述几周前休梅克在帕罗奥图听她讲过的那套法规做法。他不得不承认，她那套方法很有创意，甚至可说是偷偷摸摸。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The document explained that Theranos's devices were merely remote sample-processing units. The real work of blood analysis would take place in the company's lab in Palo Alto, where computers would analyze the data the devices transmitted to it and qualified laboratory personnel would review and interpret the results. Hence only the Palo Alto lab needed to be certified. The devices themselves were akin to "dumb" fax machines and exempt from regulatory oversight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="文档上说明，Theranos的设备只是远程采样工具，真正的血液分析工作会在Theranos的帕罗奥图实验室进行，会在实验室用电脑分析Theranos设备传回的数据，再由合格的实验室人员检验、解读结果，因此只有帕罗奥图实验室需要取得合格证明，设备本身等于是一台「哑巴」传真机，可以不受法规约束。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was a second wrinkle Shoemaker found equally hard to swallow: Theranos maintained that the blood tests its devices performed were laboratory-developed tests and therefore beyond the FDA's purview.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="休梅克发现还有一个问题很难视而不见：Theranos坚持其设备所做的血液检测是LDT（实验室自行研发的检验），因此不在FDA监督范围。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Theranos position then was that a CLIA certificate for its Palo Alto lab was sufficient for it to deploy and use its devices anywhere. This was a clever theory, but Shoemaker didn't buy it. And neither did Kelly. The Theranos devices were more than just dumb fax machines. They were blood analyzers and, like all other blood analyzers on the market, they would eventually need to be reviewed and approved by the FDA. Until then, Theranos would need to consult with an institutional review board and come up with a study protocol that the agency could live with. It was a process that typically took six to nine months.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当时Theranos的立场是：它在帕罗奥图的实验室取得CLIA合格证明就已足够，便可在任何地方使用其设备。这种论述很聪明，但是休梅克不买单。Theranos的设备绝不只是哑巴传真机而已，它们是血液分析仪，跟市场上其他血液分析仪一样，最终势必得通过FDA的检验、许可。在取得FDA许可前，Theranos必须咨询IRB（人体试验委员会），提出一套FDA可接受的试验流程，而这个过程一般需要六至九个月。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Elizabeth continued to disagree despite the army lawyer's presence. Her body language wasn't as hostile as it had been in Palo Alto and she was more willing to engage in a discussion, but they remained at an impasse. What was strange was that no one from Zuckerman Spaeder was there with her in the room. Shoemaker had expected her to show up accompanied by several of the firm's partners, but there she was on her own. She continued to invoke the firm's legal advice, but no one from the firm was present to attest to it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然有陆军律师在场，伊莉莎白还是不认同，她的身体语言已不像在帕罗奥图那么充满敌意，比较愿意好好讨论，但仍然陷入僵局。奇怪的是，Zuckerman Spaeder法律事务所并没有派人到场，休梅克原以为她会在事务所好几个合伙人陪同下现身，但却只看到她独自一人。她继续搬出律师给她的建议，但却没有半个律师在旁证明。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The meeting ended with Shoemaker reiterating that he would need to see something in writing from the FDA backing up Theranos's regulatory stance before he signed off on any experiment in Afghanistan. Elizabeth agreed to get such a letter. She acted as if it was a formality. Shoemaker very much doubted so, but at least things were now clear: the ball was in Theranos's court.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="会议最后，休梅克重申，他必须先看到FDA替Theranos的法规见解背书的书面文档，才能签署放行在阿富汗的试验。伊莉莎白同意去取得这样的信件，她表现得好像那只是个例行手续罢了，休梅克强烈不以为然，但至少态势很清楚，现在球落到Theranos那一边了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Shoemaker didn't hear anything more about the matter until the late spring of 2012, when he started receiving queries from CENTCOM again. He couldn't help but be annoyed. Not only had Theranos failed to produce the letter he'd asked for, the company had gone completely silent since he and Kelly had traveled to Washington to meet Elizabeth in December.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此后，休梅克再也没有听到任何相关消息，直到二〇一二年春末中央司令部再度来函询问。他忍不住发起火来。Theranos不仅没有提出他要求的信件，甚至自从十二月他和凯利到华盛顿见过伊莉莎白之后，就无消无息。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">With the approval of his boss, he decided to make contact with the FDA himself. On the morning of June 14, 2012, he sent an email to Sally Hojvat, the head of the agency's microbiology devices division. The two had worked together during Shoemaker's FDA fellowship in 2003 and had just run into each other at a conference the previous week. Shoemaker described to Hojvat the Theranos situation and, calling the company's regulatory approach "quite novel," requested the agency's guidance on it. Although he didn't intend his email as anything more than an informal request for advice, it set off a sequence of events that would have made him think twice about sending it if he could have foreseen them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="取得上司同意后，休梅克决定自己联系FDA。二〇一二年六月十四日，他寄了封电邮给莎莉．霍薇特（Sally Hojvat），FDA微生物设备部门主管，休梅克二〇〇三年在FDA进修时曾与她共事，恰巧在上周一场会议上不期而遇。休梅克向霍薇特解释了Theranos的情况，还说这家公司的法规做法「相当新颖」，请求FDA指点一二。他原以为这封信只是寻求建议的非正式信件，没想到却引发后续一连串事件，如果早知会如此，他发信前一定会慎重三思。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">That changed in the 1990s when laboratories started to make more complex tests for mass use, including genetic tests. By the FDA's own reckoning, scores of flawed and unreliable tests had since been marketed for conditions ranging from whooping cough and Lyme disease to various types of cancers, resulting in untold harm to patients. There was a growing consensus within the agency that it needed to start policing this part of the lab business, and the biggest proponent of that view was Gutierrez. When he saw the email Hojvat forwarded to him from Shoemaker, Gutierrez shook his head in disbelief. The approach it described was exactly the type of regulatory end run around the FDA that he wanted to put a stop to.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到了一九九〇年代，情况有所改变，各家实验室开始做比较复杂的检测供大量使用，包括基因检测。根据FDA自己的估计，市场上出现许多有瑕疵、不可靠的检测，检测项目从百日咳、莱姆病（Lyme disease）到各种癌症都有，对病患造成的伤害不可胜数。FDA内部逐渐形成共识，有必要开始监督实验室这方面的业务，而最极力拥护此主张的人就是古铁雷斯。当他看到霍薇特转寄来的休梅克信件，不可置信地摇了摇头，信中所提的回避FDA监督巧门，正是他想遏阻的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The FDA had long considered it within its power to regulate LDTs, as laboratory-developed tests were known. However, in practice, it had not done so because back in 1976, when the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act was amended to expand the agency's authority from drugs to medical devices, LDTs weren't common. They were only made by local laboratories occasionally when an unusual medical case required it.</div>

<div class="line_en">Sunny and Elizabeth ushered Yamamoto into a conference room. When he explained that his agency had received a complaint about Theranos and that he was there to look into it, he was surprised to learn that they knew where and who it came from. Someone had apparently tipped them off about Shoemaker's email to the FDA. Elizabeth was not pleased, a sentiment made clear by the scowl on her face. She and Sunny professed not to know what Shoemaker had been talking about in his email. Yes, Elizabeth had met with the army officer, but she had never told him Theranos intended to deploy its blood-testing machines far and wide under the cover of a single CLIA certificate.</div>

<div class="line_en">What Yamamoto found in the room didn't impress him but didn't raise any big concerns either: it was a small space with a couple of people in white lab coats and a smattering of commercial diagnostic instruments that were sitting idle. It looked like any other lab. No sign of any special or novel blood-testing technology. When he pointed this out, Sunny said the Theranos devices were still under development and the company had no plans to deploy them without FDA clearance -- flatly contradicting what Elizabeth had told Shoemaker on not one but two occasions. Yamamoto wasn't sure what to believe. Why would the army officer have made all that stuff up?</div>

<div class="line_en">There were no clear violations he could point to about the way Theranos was currently operating, however, so he let Sunny off with a long lecture about lab regulations. He made sure to emphasize that the scenario Shoemaker had described in his email to Sally Hojvat -- experimental blood analyzers operated remotely from one CLIA-certified mother base -- was out of the question. If Theranos intended to eventually roll its devices out to other locations, those places would need CLIA certificates too. Either that or, better yet, the devices themselves would need to be approved by the FDA.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，Theranos目前运作没有明显的违规事实，所以山本搬出实验室法规告诫一番，就放过桑尼了。山本还特别强调，休梅克写给莎莉．霍薇特的信中所描述的假想情况——凭着一份CLIA证明，就可远程使用仍在试验阶段的血液分析仪——是不可能的，如果Theranos打算把设备推展到其他地点，那些地方同样必须取得CLIA证明才行，不然就是设备本身通过FDA许可，若能这样最好。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Shoemaker also felt genuinely bad that his actions had led to an inspection of the company. He was well placed to know how unpleasant such visits could be: his previous assignment had been at the Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases, where he'd taken over as director of biosurety, the department responsible for securing biothreat agents used in army research, two weeks before Bruce Ivins killed himself in July 2008. The suicide had led to the disclosure that Ivins, an institute researcher, was the likely perpetrator of the 2001 anthrax attacks and to an avalanche of inspections from an alphabet soup of government agencies that had continued unabated for two years. Shoemaker had been the officer on the receiving end of every single one of them.</div>

He apologized and invited Shoemaker to come to CENTCOM headquarters in Tampa, Florida, the following week to walk Mattis through the regulatory issues. Shoemaker was nervous about meeting the general face-to-face, but he accepted the invitation.

<div class="line_en">Shoemaker had gone over everything again with Gutierrez and felt confident he was on solid ground. He spoke first, giving a brief overview of the issues raised by an in-theater test of the Theranos technology. Gutierrez took over from there and told the general his army colleague was correct in his interpretation of the law: the Theranos device was very much subject to regulation by the FDA. And since the agency hadn't yet reviewed and approved it for commercial use, it could only be tested on human subjects under strict conditions set by an institutional review board. One of those conditions was that the test subjects give their informed consent -- something that was notoriously hard to obtain in a war zone.</div>

His office was decorated with the mementos of a long military career. Amid the flags, plaques, and coins, Shoemaker's eyes rested briefly on a set of magnificent swords displayed in a glass cabinet.

<div class="line_en">Mattis was reluctant to give up. He wanted to know if they could suggest a way forward. As he'd put it to Elizabeth in an email a few months earlier, he was convinced her invention would be "a game-changer" for his men. Gutierrez and Shoemaker proposed a solution: a "limited objective experiment" using leftover de-identified blood samples from soldiers. It would obviate the need to obtain informed consent and it was the only type of study that could be put together as quickly as Mattis seemed to want to proceed. They agreed to pursue that course of action. Fifteen minutes after they'd walked in, Shoemaker and Gutierrez shook Mattis's hand and walked out. Shoemaker was immensely relieved. All in all, Mattis had been gruff but reasonable and a workable compromise had been reached.</div>

<div class="line_en">The limited experiment agreed upon fell short of the more ambitious live field trial Mattis had had in mind. Theranos's blood tests would not be used to inform the treatment of wounded soldiers. They would only be performed on leftover samples after the fact to see if their results matched the army's regular testing methods. But it was something. Earlier in his career, Shoemaker had spent five years overseeing the development of diagnostic tests for biological threat agents and he would have given his left arm to get access to anonymized samples from service members in theater. The data generated from such testing could be very useful in supporting applications to the FDA.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「有限试验」不若马提斯脑中所想的战区现场试验那么宏大，Theranos的血液检测不会用于了解受伤士兵的治疗情况，只会使用事后剩余的血液进行检测，看看检测结果跟军队一般检测方法是否一致，但也算是迈出了一大步。休梅克早期曾有五年时间，负责监管生物威胁制剂的诊断检测开发，很赞成使用战区军人的匿名样本，这种方法所取得的数据对于申请FDA许可很有帮助。">查看中文翻译</div>
