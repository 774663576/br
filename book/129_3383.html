<div class="line_en">The rot set in when I decided to go to Garoua for supplies. The decision was rather thrust upon me; I had nothing left to eat, barely enough petrol to make the city limits and fifteen hundred francs (about £3). Such circumstances are conducive to bold action. I had promised Augustin a lift and we rendezvoused at first light behind the main street in the hope of sneaking out of town without being loaded to the gunwales with millet or gendarmes after a lift. A swift dash freed us from the town and we resigned ourselves to the heaving, wrenching crawl over the worst part of the road, leading down to the tarmac. We never made it. Some five miles short of our goal, I rounded a corner to find that the road had simply disappeared in the rain. It is a bad Western habit to assume that because a road goes into a corner, it will continue round the other side. With a terrifying crunching of metal, we plunged into a foot-deep ditch right across the track.</div>

<div class="line_en">We arrived without further disaster, having carefully obeyed the injunctions painted on the inside of the vehicle telling us not to spit, fight, vomit or break windows. By now, it was nearly midday and Augustin took me to dine in his favourite African restaurant where the choice consisted of take it or leave it. I took it, then left it. I was brought a cow's foot in a large enamel bowl of hot water. When I say "cow's foot" I do not mean something based upon a cow's foot, but the entire article complete with hoof, hide and hair. Try as I might, there seemed no way of even getting into it. I declared a sudden loss of appetite. Augustin seized it and reduced it to bones with the dedication of a swarm of driver ants.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was obvious at once that there was something amiss with the steering. It whined and grumbled and doggedly refused to affect the direction of the wheels. Having lived on a Junior Lecturer's salary, I had had precious little to do with cars and was at a loss how best to proceed. Clearly, help was in order. Normally Herbert Brown could be relied upon to mend anything; wondrous tales were told of his mechanical prowess. With two coat hangers and an old plough, he would improvise a gearbox. His engineering solutions were never elegant but often worked. He would return them to customers with the remark, "It's just a load of junk, but out here nothin' works for long." Alas, he was away. There was nothing else for it, I still had to get to Garoua. We pushed the vehicle to the side of the road and continued on foot, flagging down a bush-taxi when we reached the tarmac. I did not, at that time, take the inscription on the door "God's will alone decides" as an omen.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="车子的转向轴有问题了。它发出呜咽、隆隆声，拒不接受方向盘指挥。以往我只靠微薄的初级讲师（Junior Lecturer）薪水过活，甚少接触车子，完全不知该怎么办。找人帮忙才是上策。通常不管机器出了什么问题，都可以找布朗牧师，他在机械方面的神奇能力，众口相传。光凭两只衣架与一个旧犁，当场就可变出一个工具箱。他的解决方式不漂亮却管用。当他将修好的东西送还给你时，常会加上一句：“这是一堆废物，但是在非洲，样样东西都用不久。”不幸，今天他外出了。无法可想，还是得去加路亚。我们将车子推到路旁，开始步行，抵达柏油路后拦下一辆丛林计程车。当时，我并未把教会门上的铭文“上帝的意旨决定一切”当作恶兆。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Nonetheless, we reached my abandoned vehicle as night fell. He made a rapid inspection. There was no problem; all he had to do was hit it. He crawled underneath and there was heard the clang of metal on metal and what I took to be Fulani oaths. Beaming, he emerged. It was not perfect but would get me to Poli whence I could send for a new part.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="尽管如此，我们还是在傍晚抵达我的车子旁。他快速检査一番。车子没问题，他只要敲一敲就好了。他爬到车下，我听到金属敲击声以及富来尼语咒骂。他微笑着爬出车底。车子虽未完全修好，但开回波利没问题。到时我再换新零件好了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Two notable successes marked this trip. Firstly, I charmed some money out of the bank to which I had so rashly committed my finances. Secondly, we arranged a lift back to Poli with the sous-préfet's mechanic. This was, I foolishly thought, an incredible stroke of good fortune. After being driven for hours round various Fulani areas of the city on incomprehensible errands, we set off for Poli. The road is very narrow and patronized by huge lorries with trailers hauling cotton and petrol back and forth between Chad and the N'gaoundere rail link. I noted with dismay that when he passed one of these monsters by swerving over to the verge with one wheel inches away from a three-foot drainage channel, the driver closed his eyes tightly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="此行有两大胜利。第一，我从当初贸然存钱进去的银行巧言哄骗出一笔钱来。第二，我找到副县长的机械工载我们返回波利。当时我愚蠢地以为这是鸿运临头。他先载我们在城里的富来尼人区绕了几小时，办一大堆琐事，终于出发前往波利。道路非常狭小，挤满载运棉花、汽油来往乍得与恩冈代雷的联结卡车。我惊恐发现这位机械工超越庞然卡车时，居然是双眼紧闭，整个车子急速往旁一偏，车轮离路旁三英尺高的排水渠不到数英寸。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We arrived at the top of the big hill leading down to Poli and began to descend. It was not until we approached a narrow bridge crossing a ravine that I realized that the steering had gone again. I had time to recollect the sharp spikes along either side of the bridge -- all that remained of the balustrade after an accident that had killed a sous-préfet at this very spot several years before. We struck a tree, bounced off, struck a rock and headed straight for the ravine. I was already standing on the brakes to no great avail. We were poised an instant on the edge and then plunged over.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们开抵通往波利的山头，开始下坡。直到驶近横跨峡谷的窄桥时，才发现转向轴又完全不灵了。我居然还有时间想起桥头两边的尖刺——那原本是栏杆，数年前，一位副县长在此车祸死亡，将栏杆撞得只剩尖刺。我们的车子先是撞上树干，弹回来撞上石头，直直往峡谷里冲。我整个人的力量全踩在煞车上，没用，车子在崖边悬了一会儿，随即掉下去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I was frankly delighted. Augustin and I embarked and set off at a sedate pace. The steering indeed felt a little strange but worked with a certain approximation. The road was covered with owls. They would sit on the surface and fly up to attack the headlights of cars; the slaughter of them on the roads is very great, and they terrify Dowayos. Owls are thought to carry sorcery under their wings at night. Should a man hear the sound of one about his compound or cattle, he immediately seeks remedies against them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我高兴极了。奥古斯丁与我爬上车，以缓慢速度出发。转向轴还是怪怪的，但多少愿意照方向盘的指示前进。路上到处都是猫头鹰。它们常会踞坐路面，突然飞起来撞向车前灯，到处都是它们的尸体。多瓦悠人很怕猫头鹰，认为到了夜里，妖巫便躲在它们的翅膀下飞行。如果你的屋外或牛圈传来猫头鹰叫声，必须赶快寻求解方。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A sapling caught us neatly and gradually collapsed under the weight. In complete calm, I turned off the engine, asked Augustin if he was all right and evacuated the vehicle. At the top of the ravine, something suddenly snapped in both of us and we sat looking at the jagged rocks and laughed hysterically -- not, of course, from amusement, but from some wave of sheer emotion compounded of terror, relief and incredulity. I think we probably sat there quite a while. At this stage, we seemed to have got out of it very lightly. Augustin had bruised his chest. I had hit my head on the wheel and one or two toes, fingers and ribs seemed to have suffered. Hiking into town, we set about a couple of beers Augustin had secreted against dire emergencies. We felt we had qualified.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一棵树干净利落接住我们，然后慢慢被重量压垮。我非常镇定，熄掉引擎，问奥古斯丁可还好，然后爬出车外。从峡谷爬上来后，看着底下尖刺嶙峋的岩石，我们突然无法自抑歇斯底里大笑，非觉有趣，而是恐惧、如释重负与不可思议。我想我们呆坐了许久。逃过一劫，我和奥古斯丁都没受大伤，他胸口瘀青，我的头撞到方向盘，手指、脚趾与肋骨大概也受伤。徒步返回波利，我们喝了几瓶奥古斯丁窖藏起来应付危急状况的啤酒。此刻完全符合条件。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The next day the full awfulness of the situation was brought home. An inspection of the wreck convinced me that repair would be a protracted and expensive business and that we had indeed been lucky to escape without serious injury. We had a check-up with the local doctor who declared us both unharmed. From the fact that I still have fingers and toes set at odd angles and a lump on two ribs, I infer that his examination failed to show up a number of minor fractures. The worst part was the condition of my jaw. Two teeth at the front seemed very loose and my whole jaw began slowly to swell up, causing me considerable pain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天，我们才完全明白损伤状况。仔细检查车子后，看来修理势必旷日费时且所费不赀。但是我们逃过一劫仅受轻伤，实在太幸运了。我请当地医师检查，他宣称我们都没受伤。但是我的手指与脚趾角度奇怪，两根肋骨肿起一大块，显然他的检查并未看出轻微的骨折。我的两颚状况最惨，两颗门牙摇摇欲坠，整个下颚肿起来，痛苦不堪。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Dowayos, as mentioned, divide diseases between "infectious diseases", head witchcraft, ancestor interference and pollutions. Only infectious diseases or accidental injuries that may be caused by witchcraft can be helped with herbs. The attribution of one particular disease to a specific cause is quite complex. The names of some diseases refer both to symptoms and a causal agent (like our word "cold" which implies certain symptoms and a viral cause). Other names are just symptoms (like "jaundice" that can be the result of many diseases). To tie up symptoms with diseases, various forms of divination are used. A healer may be called to cast the entrails of a chicken into water, the man may be viewed through a glass ball by a specialist who can thus determine his malady. The most common form of divination, however, is to rub the plant zepto between the fingers while calling out the various forms of disease that may afflict the man. When the zepto breaks, this shows that the correct name has been found. The diviner then moves on to the causative agent -- witchcraft, ancestors, etc. Next comes the remedy. Three divinations normally suffice to give full information. If the sick man cannot come to the diviner himself, he should send some of the straw from the roof of his granary, the most private and personal area of a man's compound.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我前面说过多瓦悠人将疾病分为传染性疾病、头部巫术（head witchcraft）、亡灵骚扰与污染性疾病。惟有传染性疾病与巫术导致的意外伤害可用药草治疗。判断疾病的成因是非常复杂的过程。有些疾病的名字同时指称病征与致病因子（譬如我们的“伤风”可指称某些症状，也代表病毒感染致病）。有些疾病的名字则特指病征（譬如“黄疸过高”可能是多种疾病的结果）。从病征确定疾病须使用多种占卜。病家先找来一个医师，他将鸡的内脏丢到水里。也可找一种专家用玻璃球观看患者，确定病征。最常见的占卜术是在手指间搓揉一种名为扎布托（zepto）的植物，口中喊着患者可能罹患的各种病名。扎布托断了，当时所叫的病名就是正确疾病。接着占卜者再用同样方法找出致病因子是巫术、祖灵或其他。最后才是确定药方。至少要经过三道占卜手续，才能得到全部资讯。如果患者无法到占卜者处，可以请人将谷仓屋顶上的稻草送去，谷仓是一个院落里最隐密、最私人的处所。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Pollution diseases usually require the attention of experts -- circumciser, sorcerer or rainchief. Often, causes and effects can be linked in a rather oblique fashion. For example, what we would term a sprain is held to hurt because worms have got into the limb; worms come from rain, so only the rainchief can cure them. Contact with the affairs of the dead, on the other hand, involves treatment by the sorcerer and consists of rubbing the garments or other personal belongings of the dead man onto the victim. The worst pollution diseases come from the blacksmith and his wives, the potters. Excessive contact with them, especially with the tools of their trade, causes what one can only term an ingrowing vagina in women and a prolapsed anus in men. The bellows that afflicts men is a remarkably phallic object and the fact that it attacks the anus rather than the penis has to be connected to the "official" version of circumcision, claiming it to involve sealing of the anus.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="污染性疾病往往需要出动专家——割礼人、巫师或祈雨酋长。疾病的因果关系判断往往模糊暧昧。譬如，在我们看来是扭伤，他们却认为是虫跑进了手脚，属外力伤害。虫随雨而至，因此要找祈雨酋长治疗。碰触死者而罹患的疾病则需巫师治疗，疗法是以死者的衣物或其他私人物品擦抹患者。最可怕的污染性疾病来自铁匠与他的妻妾（制陶者）。与他们接触过多，尤其是碰触他们的工具，会生一种恐怖的病——女人的阴道会不断向内生长，男人的肛门则会脱垂。让男人致病的风箱非常类似阳具，它之所以攻击男性的肛门而非阴茎，可能和割礼的“官方版本”——割礼是缝合男性肛门——有关。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Other men set up charms that cause pollution illness to protect their property. A close contact of mine was the clown for the village of Kongle. He was proprietor of the only orange tree in the area and was inordinately attached to me since the time I bought two hundred oranges from him. (I should confess that I had not intended to buy two hundred oranges but twenty; an inadequacy in my handling of numerals lay at the root of the problem.) To protect his tree from the ravages of children, he attached certain plants and goat horns to it so that anyone who stole his oranges would cough like a goat and have to come to him to be cured.</div>

<div class="line_en">Head witchcraft is transmitted from close relatives in peanuts or meat. It fears sharp objects and a boy should therefore not be exposed to it before circumcision or he may bleed to death. At night it wanders around and is said to look like a small chick; this is what is carried under the wings of an owl. It sucks the blood of men and cattle and may kill them. Protection may be had by putting sharp thistles or porcupine quills on the roof of one's hut. After death, skulls are examined for witchcraft. I did not at first grasp that people who die "of witchcraft" are generally not the victims of witches, but witches whose witchcraft has been injured by such charms: once the witchcraft is injured the owner dies. Dowayos use this to explain the high mortality rate among young men who go to the city to work in the dry season. They are only young -- mere boys -- who have not learned to control their witchcraft. It is especially excited by the sight of meat on butchers' slabs and cuts itself on all the sharp knives lying around there.</div>

<div class="line_en">On one occasion a woman was universally held to be a witch and to have conveyed the infection to her two daughters, both of whom had died. I was present at the examination of the skull of the second. The head was removed from the corpse by an old man using a bent stick. He was much admired for the dexterity with which he inserted the end in the eye socket and flicked off the head without losing any teeth that drop down into the stomach. The cadaver was some three weeks old and the stench was fairly bad; the man would receive a goatskin from the parents for this service. As usual there was a fair amount of ribald humour. The women were sent away: "If we bent down to pick up the head and farted you would tell everyone." They withdrew with considerable peevishness and the men examined the head. In my time in Dowayoland I examined a large number of skulls but could never convince myself that the difference between one held to show witchcraft and one free of it was based upon any perceived morphological distinction. The old men were always unanimous, however. The announcement of the finding of witchcraft was greeted not with anger but quiet satisfaction by the village. The woman was, in fact, a close neighbour of mine and immediately jokes began to fly about to the effect that only a white man, immune like all white men to witchcraft, could live next to her. She seemed annoyed at this slur and offered to walk over the skulls of the dead, in which case, were she the source of their witchcraft, she would die. The husband refused to let her. "What's the point?" he explained to me. "She'd only die and then I'd have to buy another wife."</div>

<div class="line_en">It is revealed after death as two spikes under the upper jaw. If these are red or black this means the witchcraft has killed. Where there have been a number of deaths of confirmed witches in a single family, suspicion will normally rapidly centre on a particular relative. In pre-colonial times accused witches were put to the ordeal. They would be required, if male, to drink beer in which the knife of circumcision had been soaked; if guilty, their stomachs would swell up and they would bleed to death. Alternatively, they would be required to drink beer containing the poisonous latex sap of the dangoh (Euphorbica Cameroonica) cactus. If they did not vomit they would die and be held convicted as charged; if they did vomit, white vomit betokened innocence, red vomit guilt. The guilty would then be hanged by the blacksmith.</div>

<div class="line_en">There was none of the wide-eyed fear I had rather expected in the face of witchcraft; the whole thing was viewed in a rather deadpan, matter-of-fact fashion. Dowayos always stressed to me that there were different sorts of head witchcraft, only one of which was bad. Some forms merely gave a man clean teeth; other forms gave success in farming and involved no other person's disadvantage. They would never quite believe me when I explained that such matters interested me because they did not exist in the land of the white men. I was unaware at that time of the Dowayo pedigree as a reincarnated magician that had been constructed for me. Dowayos would never call me a liar but they had a particular facial expression they would adopt when I was trying to put some particularly blatant falsehood over on them such as the existence of underground trains, or the absence of bridewealth in England.</div>

<div class="line_en">Healers were, on the whole, only too happy to work with me for the relatively small payment I was able to provide. Their only fear was that I would steal their remedies and set myself up in business. In primitive society knowledge is seldom freely available; rather it belongs to people. A man owns his knowledge. He has paid for it and he would be a fool to give it away without payment to another, just as he wouldn't give away his daughters without brideprice. It was only reasonable that they should charge me. Dowayos justify their remedies by their pedigrees. An old remedy is better than a new one; any innovation is suspect as it does not carry the imprimatur of the ancestors. Consequently, there is no attempt to find new remedies.</div>

<div class="line_en">Healers were initially suspicious of my "clinic" until they had satisfied themselves that I limited myself to the treatment of infectious diseases with white men's roots and was not in competition with them. One particular case raised certain moral and strategic difficulties. The Chief's brother, who lived several huts away, used to come and visit me quite often. He was a gangling, awkward and affable man who had a reputation for being not too bright. I realized one day that he had not been to see me for several weeks and, on inquiring whether he was away, I was informed that he was dying. He had suffered a severe bout of amoebic dysentery and the healer from up the cliff had been called. The examination of the entrails of a chicken had revealed that he was being afflicted by the spirit of his dead mother who wanted beer. This had been flung upon the skull but there was no improvement. Another healer was called. He revealed that, in fact, the illness derived from another spirit masquerading as the spirit of the man's mother. Offerings were made but the young man still weakened. The Chief's third wife, who had looked after him as a boy, was very distressed and came and wailed outside my hut asking if I had no roots that might save him. It was impossible to refuse, since I indeed had some powerful amoebicides and antibiotics. I explained to everyone that I was not a healer and that I did not know whether my roots might help but that if they wished me to try to heal him I would do so. I had been afraid of alienating the healers by this but they were quite prepared to find that a wrong diagnosis had been made. The man's recovery was swift. He passed from a skeletal condition to good health in a matter of days and there was general rejoicing. The healers were in no way put out. They merely explained that this was a complex case of a man ill with an infectious disease but that various spirits had taken advantage of it to increase his sufferings. They had dealt with the spirits; I had dealt with the disease.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was only when they were ill that I really felt sorry for Dowayos and felt their way of life to be inferior to our own. Otherwise they enjoyed freedom, held themselves to be wealthy, had clear access to their major forms of sensual gratification in beer and women, and had their self-respect. Once ill, however, they died needlessly in agony and terror. There was no real help for them in the government hospital in Poli. There was a regulation that every patient had to turn up with a half exercise book to keep the records of his case in. Illiterate tribesmen had no need of exercise books and therefore never had one to hand; they were not on sale in Poli and the hospital staff refused to keep them as this was not part of their responsibility according to the rules. Patients would be turned away and refused urgent medical treatment until they could find an exercise book. Inevitably, I became a benefactor in this matter, as did the missions, but the effect was that many Dowayos did not bother to go to the hospital at all. There were doubtless many deaths as the result of this, and I found it impossible to condone the arrogant inhumanity of officials in such circumstances. I was guiltily aware that, when I myself was ill, simply because I was a white man I would be expected to jump queues and receive preferential treatment as did local grandees.</div>

<div class="line_en">Another sensitive moment cropped up at the visit of a French botanist on a whistle-stop tour through Cameroon researching for a projected botanical atlas showing the distribution of plants in the country. I arrived back in my village one day to find this gentleman ensconced in the schoolhouse while surveying the local flora in six hours flat. The Dowayos, of course, could not see why anyone should be interested in plants for their own sake. It was clear that he was trying to steal Dowayo herbal remedies that he would sell elsewhere at huge profit. He ran to a somewhat larger establishment than I did, having procured his own chickens in preference to the local models and two retainers to attend to his wants. We sat down in the middle of the bush to an absurd dinner, complete with tablecloth and serviettes, while Dowayo children crouched round us in a circle, wide-eyed with curiosity. He kindly explained to me how best to take botanical samples for later identification. Face-to-face with Africa, the differences between a French botanist and an English anthropologist seem minimal and we talked far into the night.</div>

<div class="line_en">By our lights, the remedies handed out by traditional practitioners are ineffective or even harmful. So alien to our world view are such practices as rubbing goats" horns on a patient's chest to cure tuberculosis that we do not even bother to check their effectiveness. We can handle them quite well under general principles of sympathetic and contagious magic, so that for the anthropologist they hardly register at all. This aspect of their beliefs never really struck me until I began to work with the rainchiefs; but that must be told in its place.</div>

<div class="line_en">The next day my local healer was more than a little brusque at this outrageous raid staged by my "brother". I finally convinced him that we were not even from the same country by referring to the fact that Zuuldibo had offered him beer which he had refused.

<div class="line_en">Most Dowayo remedies are based upon the same three magic plants that are expected to deal with all forms of misfortune from adultery to headache. They divide each into several species that cannot be distinguished by the layman by mere physical inspection. Dowayos would always speak as if they were staunch positivists, never believing anything for which they had no direct sense evidence. "How do you tell one kind of zepto, for example, from another?" I would ask. "How can I tell whether this is the kind that stops adultery or the kind that heals headaches?" They stared at me in sheer disbelief at such simplicity. "By trying them," they would answer. "How else?" They would then go off into long diatribes about stones that caused rain, people who turned into leopards, bats that vomited their excrement through their nostrils as they had no anus -- all in violation of their positivist principles. It was impossible to know in advance how they would react to questioning in this sphere. Sometimes they would rattle out the three different ways of saying "I do not know" with various degrees of exasperation. On occasions I would actually get a straight answer, but more often it was "I do not know. I have not seen. How could I know when I have not seen?" I began to earn a reputation as a man who would believe anything.</div>

<div class="line_en">My jaw, however, had not healed up; indeed, it had got much worse, An unpleasant mixture of blood and pus had begun to ooze from my gums. The time had come to seek help. I stopped off at the mission and found Herbert Brown, who was delighted to hear of the way in which Africa had confounded all my expectations, justifying as it did his own gloomy view of the Dark Continent. He undertook to attempt a repair of the car, although he could not say quite when it would be completed. If I had known it would take nine months, I would have been less grateful.

Within was a certain amount of dilapidated dental equipment and a large diploma from the University of Lyons, which reassured me somewhat. I explained the problem to a huge man inside. Without more ado, he seized a pair of pliers and pulled out my two front teeth. The unexpectedness of the attack somewhat dulled my senses to the pain of the extraction. The teeth, he declared, were rotten. Perhaps, he hinted darkly, they had always been rotten. He had removed them. I was cured. I should pay the nurse outside. I sat blankly in the chair, blood gushing down my shirtfront, and tried to make him understand that he could now proceed to the next stage of his treatment. It is not easy to argue in a foreign tongue in the absence of two front teeth; I made little progress. Finally, he understood that I was a difficult patient. Very well, he declared huffily, if I was not content with his treatment, he would bring the dentist himself. He disappeared, leaving me wondering who had just operated upon me.

I always hated going up to see him because it involved crawling up a crumbling rock face with precipitous drops, but there was nothing for it. The man had chosen this inhospitable place to live for several reasons. Firstly, it was traditionally the way Dowayos were supposed to live, cultivating the hillsides on terraces so steep that they do so on their knees. Moreover, being several hundred feet higher, the climate was more suited to growing small varieties of millet that were more valued by Dowayos than the gross forms that flourish on the plains.

This was always a wise move. Once a ceremony was under way, there would be so many marauding kinsmen that no one would have time for an anthropologist's foolish questions. Moreover, it gave me time to look at the sort of answers I was getting and the sort of questions I was putting and see whether they could not be improved on. I would follow this up with a second visit several days after the festival to clear up any points that arose in the heat of performance and check identities, inconsistencies and differences with other villages" ways of conducting the ritual. It was also a chance to get good pictures of ritual paraphernalia that would not have been returned to their owners yet and which might not emerge clearly in photographs taken during the ceremony. I had decided as a matter of policy to send my undeveloped films home and have friends check them there. Having them developed in Cameroon would be both expensive and unreliable, and keeping them for eighteen months in such a climate very risky. It meant that many would be lost in the mail and that I would not be able to see them myself until I returned to England, but on the whole it seemed the wisest course. The great disadvantage was that it considerably increased my contact with the officials at the post office who were past masters at ineptitude and unhelpfulness, even by local standards.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="相较于攀爬时的辛苦，抵达之后的工作环境很宜人：山地村落气候舒爽，人们热情欢迎我，其实离我的茅屋也不算太远。我检查了相机、录音机后，先去拜访主人以贿赂他，探询他举办此次仪式的动机、该准备些什么。先行拜访是聪明之举。一旦仪式开始，大批亲属四面八方涌入，谁也没时间理会人类学者的愚蠢发问。此外，先行拜访给我充裕时间检查我得到的答案、思索我要问的问题，看看有无改进之处。仪式过后几天，我会二度造访村子，询问仪式当天发生的一些事，核对仪式参与者的身份，它和其他村落举行的仪式有何差异及不连贯之处。这时仪式器物尚未归还主人，正好可以拍照，这比仪式中拍到的照片更清楚。我将底片都寄回英国，请朋友帮我冲印。在喀麦隆冲洗底片既贵又不可靠，但是底片在这种气候下一放十八个月，也很危险。寄回英国有可能半途丢了，也要回国后才能看，但整体而言，还是比较聪明。最大的缺点是大大增加了我与邮局人员的接触，即使以当地标准，他们也堪称是蠢笨与无能的大师。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Once they settled in Poli they were the relentless goal of my mail runs. In their agreeable company one could speak English of a sort, eat bread that Jeannie baked in the kitchen, listen to music and talk about things other than millet and cattle. It was Jon's task to communicate to Dowayos "the meaning of Christianity", as it was mine to establish "the meaning of Dowayo culture". We both helped each other to an understanding of the limitations of our mutual endeavours. Jon was the proud owner, moreover, of twelve barrels of trash literature that he generously lent out. I maintain that it was this, above all else, that kept me sane in Dowayoland. Those infinite longueurs between ceremonies, those terrible dull evenings after seven o'clock when all Dowayos were abed, became so much less frustrating with something to read. Fieldwork became the most concentrated literary experience of my life. Never before had I had such an opportunity to read. I read sitting on rocks, half-way up mountains, sitting in streams, crouched in huts by the light of the moon, waiting at crossroads by the light of oil-lamps. I was never without one of Jon's paperbacks. When expectations failed and holy oaths to me were broken, I would simply slip into fieldwork gear, pull out my paperback and outwait the Dowayos.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jon and Jeannie Berg, as they revealed themselves, were now missionaries to Poli -- colleagues at the Protestant mission of Herbert Brown. They were young Americans, new to Africa, as baffled by the whole experience as I had been. It was Jon's task to look after teaching in the Bible school; Jeannie was his helpmate. We all bore the heavy scent of higher education.</div>

<div class="line_en">These last few days before the ceremony brought a major change in my conditions of life. I was in town on my mail run when there appeared an unknown truck laden with boxes, barrels and trunks. Unknown vehicles were always grounds for rife speculation. This one contained two unknown white people, a man and a woman. As resident white man it fell to me to go up first and poke my nose into their affairs. We had a conversation in rather awkward French, in the course of which it became apparent that we were all anglophones and my hand, with two broken fingers, was crushed in a manly grip.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在仪式的前几天，我的生活水平突然大大改变。那天我进城取信，来了一辆陌生卡车，满载箱子、桶子与行李。陌生车辆向来招引诸种揣测。卡车上是一男一女陌生白人，身为驻地白人，上前探头探脑是我的责任。我们用生硬的法语交谈，不久即发现我们都来自英语系国家，男人热情握手，差点捏碎我两根手指早已骨折的手。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Jon and Jeannie, apart from solving my transport problem and proving willing to haul supplies from the city, fulfilled several other needs. Jon lent me a key to his office, so I could use it when he was travelling. It had a real desk, the first flat writing surface I had seen in Dowayoland, electric light and paper. These luxuries cannot be appreciated by anyone who has not lived in an African mountain village. I could step through the door and simply leave Dowayoland for several hours at a stretch. I could spread out my notebooks and begin to analyse my data, to detect areas where my knowledge was sketchy, to scent other parts where inquiry might be rewarding, to pursue the demands of abstract thought without interruption or distraction -- most un-African pursuits.</div>

<div class="line_en">All this, of course, lay in the future on our first encounter, but events rather overtook my own expectations. I was engaged, as I mentioned, on the recording of the jar-ceremony. I turned up on the announced day and found, to my surprise, that the ceremony would indeed take place as advertised. I confess that climbing the mountain took rather more out of me than I had expected; by the time I reached the top I could hardly stand, and the world was swimming before my eyes. I recorded the ceremony as best I could, the decoration of the dead woman's jar as a candidate for circumcision, the songs and the dance where a man carried the jar on his head. But something was definitely very wrong. I could hardly keep my eyes open, the weight of my camera seemed unbearable, Dowayo "explanations" suddenly annoyed me beyond all measure. I was sitting on the wall of the cattle-park, working out the kin-relations between the various participants, when a man warned me not to sit in that particular place on pain of catching a horrible disease. I sought explanations from my assistant. The problem lay, he explained, in certain broken pots over in one corner. Therein accumulated certain gases that might draw the vitamins from my stomach. This gibberish was just too much for me and I found myself in a great rage, rather to my surprise since this was quite typical of the explanations I was used to from Dowayos who could read and write. In my normal frame of mind I would have noted this merely as an attempted translation of a traditional Dowayo perception into a pseudo-Western form. In fact, as I discovered by much painstaking inquiry later, the danger lay in the stones to ensure the fertility of the cattle that were buried under the broken pots. These could interfere with human sexuality and should only be approached by old men well past the age of paternity. In sitting as I was, I was risking my own fertility.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些当然都是我们初次见面后的事。但仪式部分的发展也超乎我的预期，前面说过我忙着记录医师之妻的水瓮仪式，我照宣布的仪式日现身，讶然发现它居然准时举行。我必须承认爬山耗掉我太多精力，到了山头，我差点站不住，世界在我眼前打转。我尽力记录仪式——死者水瓮如何布置成接受割礼者的模样、男人将水瓮高举过头边歌边舞。但情况显然不对，我的眼睛几乎睁不开来，相机重得拿不动，多瓦悠人的“解释”也令我恼怒不已。当时我坐在牛圈的墙上，忙着厘清仪式参与者的亲属关系，一个男人警告我不要坐在那里，以免染上可怕重病。我问马修他是什么意思。马修说问题出在角落的破瓦瓮，它们蓄积气体，会吸走我胃里的维生素。我实在受够这种胡言乱语，突然勃然大怒，连自己都大吃一惊，因为这是受过教育的多瓦悠人的典型答案，我早该习惯了。如果我当时心智正常，便会察觉这是传统多瓦悠人思维模式伪装成西方想法。后来我颇费一番工夫，才发现破瓦瓮下埋的是保佑牛只繁育的石头。它会扰乱人的生育，惟有丧失生育能力的老人才能接近。坐在那里，我可能终生不育。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Still rather bleary-minded, I continued my work for another week or so until Jon drove out to the village to see me with another missionary from N'gaoundere. I do not recall our conversation. It was something to do with the sexual connotations of penis yams, an example of which I had procured that very day. They exchanged meaningful looks and went into a huddle. It seemed that they were a little concerned at my condition and wanted to give me a lift to the mission hospital at N'gaoundere.</div>

<div class="line_en">By the end of the ceremony, I was hardly able even to make notes and fled back down the mountain at breakneck speed to collapse on my mud bed. Next day, before the sun rose fully, I crept into town to see the doctor. He looked in my eyes, examined my bright orange urine under the microscope and declared that I had viral hepatitis. "You haven't had any injections from a dirty needle recently?" he asked. I thought back to the dentist at Garoua. The only cure was a regime of B complex vitamins, plenty of rest and rich diet. Given my current circumstances, this was out of the question. After some two days in bed, I felt rather better and went back up the mountain to finish the inquiry into the jar-ceremony.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到了仪式尾声，我几乎无法记笔记，以可能摔断脖子的高速飞奔回村，颓然倒在床上。第二天，太阳尚未完全露脸，我便爬进城看医师。他看看我的眼珠，在显微镜下检査我鲜黄色的尿液，宣布我感染了病毒性肝炎。他问：“最近你可曾用过不干净的针头注射？”我想到加路亚那位牙医。惟一药方是大量摄取维生素B、休息与营养饮食。考量我的状况，这些完全不可行。在床上躺了几天，我觉得好多了，便回到山上继续询问水瓮仪式的细节。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I was far from convinced that such extreme measures were necessary but, luckily for me, they insisted on dropping by the next day on the way out of town. It seemed wise to ponder the matter. Armed with soap, I set out for the swimming-place but, a mere hundred yards from the village, was assailed by a huge bout of fatigue that made it impossible to continue. Sitting down on a convenient rock, I was quite unable to command my legs. It began to rain heavily but motion was still totally beyond me. I recalled that it was my birthday and simply collapsed in tears, in which condition I was discovered by Gaston, a man from a nearby village. I sobbed out my inability to walk and he simply picked me up and carried me back to my hut, where I slept until hauled to the hospital.</div>
