She knew full well the enormity of her offense, but because her desires were stronger than the code she was breaking, she persisted in breaking it. She persisted, and her subsequent reaction is something that all of us have known at one time or another. She did something every child has done -- she tried to put the evidence of her offense away from her.

I need not remind you of their appearance and conduct on the stand -- you saw them for yourselves. The witnesses for the state, with the exception of the sheriff of Maycomb County, have presented themselves to you gentlemen, to this court, in the cynical confidence that their testimony would not be doubted, confident that you gentlemen would go along with them on the assumption -- the evil assumption -- that all Negroes lie, that all Negroes are basically immoral beings, that all Negro men are not to be trusted around our women, an assumption one associates with minds of their caliber.</div>

<div class="line_en">"One more thing, gentlemen, before I quit. Thomas Jefferson once said that all men are created equal, a phrase that the Yankees and the distaff side of the Executive branch in Washington are fond of hurling at us. There is a tendency in this year of grace, 1935, for certain people to use this phrase out of context, to satisfy all conditions. The most ridiculous example I can think of is that the people who run public education promote the stupid and idle along with the industrious -- because all men are created equal, educators will gravely tell you, the children left behind suffer terrible feelings of inferiority. We know all men are not created equal in the sense some people would have us believe -- some people are smarter than others, some people have more opportunity because they're born with it, some men make more money than others, some ladies make better cakes than others -- some people are born gifted beyond the normal scope of most men.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“先生们，在我结束我的话以前，还有一件事要说。托马斯·杰佛逊说过：所有的人生而平等。这旬名言，北方佬和华盛顿的妇女机构喜欢用来抨击我们。目前，在公元一九三五年的今天有这么一种趋势，那就是有些人不看具体情况，各取所需，断章取义，滥用这旬名言。据我所知，最荒谬的例予是，那些经管公共教育的人，让愚钝、懒惰的孩子与聪明勤奋的孩子一道升学，其理由是，所有的人生而平等。教育家会严肃地告诉你，后进的孩子会因自卑而备受折磨。我们知道，有的人比别的人聪明，有的人有更多的机会，因此运气好一些，有的男人比别的男人会赚钱，有的女人比别的女人会做蛋糕，一言以蔽之，有的人的天赋是大多数正常的人所望尘莫及的。在这个意义上，不是所有的人都生而平等，尽管有人想要我们这样去理解这旬名言。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I'm no idealist to believe firmly in the integrity of our courts and in the jury system -- that is no ideal to me, it is a living, working reality. Gentlemen, a court is no better than each man of you sitting before me on this jury. A court is only as sound as its jury, and a jury is only as sound as the men who make it up. I am confident that you gentlemen will review without passion the evidence you have heard, come to a decision, and restore this defendant to his family. In the name of God, do your duty."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我不是坚信我们的法庭完美无缺和坚信陪审团制度优越无比的理想主义者。这两者我看不是理想的事物，而只是一个起作用的现实存在。先生们，法庭并不比由诸位组成的陪审团的任何一员更完美。法庭只是与其陪审团一样健全，而陪审团只是与其成员一样健全。我相信，诸位先生会不偏不倚地重新审核你们获得的证据，作出决定，让这位被告回到家里去。以上帝的名义履行你们的职责吧。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"But there is one way in this country in which all men are created equal -- there is one human institution that makes a pauper the equal of a Rockefeller, the stupid man the equal of an Einstein, and the ignorant man the equal of any college president. That institution, gentlemen, is a court. It can be the Supreme Court of the United States or the humblest J. P. court in the land, or this honorable court which you serve. Our courts have their faults, as does any human institution, but in this country our courts are the great levelers, and in our courts all men are created equal.</div>
