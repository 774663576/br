<div class="line_en">"How unhappy I have been," he said to himself. "And yet I deserve everything, for I am certainly very stubborn and stupid! I will always have my own way. I won't listen to those who love me and who have more brains than I. But from now on, I'll be different and I'll try to become a most obedient boy. I have found out, beyond any doubt whatever, that disobedient boys are certainly far from happy, and that, in the long run, they always lose out. I wonder if Father is waiting for me. Will I find him at the Fairy's house? It is so long, poor man, since I have seen him, and I do so want his love and his kisses. And will the Fairy ever forgive me for all I have done? She who has been so good to me and to whom I owe my life! Can there be a worse or more heartless boy than I am anywhere?"</div>

<div class="line_en">Tormented by the wish to see his father and his fairy sister with azure hair, he raced like a greyhound. As he ran, he was splashed with mud even up to his cap.</div>

<div class="line_en">As he spoke, he stopped suddenly, frozen with terror.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他正这么自言自语，一下子大吃一惊，停了下来，还倒退了四步。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">An immense Serpent lay stretched across the road -- a Serpent with a bright green skin, fiery eyes which glowed and burned, and a pointed tail that smoked like a chimney.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他看见了一条大蛇，直挺挺地横躺在路上。这条蛇绿皮火眼，尾巴很尖，像是烟囱在冒烟。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He waited an hour; two hours; three hours; but the Serpent was always there, and even from afar one could see the flash of his red eyes and the column of smoke which rose from his long, pointed tail.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他等了一个钟头，两个钟头，三个钟头，可蛇还在那儿。虽然离得老远，还能看见它那双火眼红红的，尾巴尖冒出一股一股烟柱。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Pinocchio, trying to feel very brave, walked straight up to him and said in a sweet, soothing voice:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后皮诺乔鼓足了勇气，走运那蛇，离开它几步，用很甜很细的声音讨好地对它说：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">How frightened was poor Pinocchio! He ran back wildly for half a mile, and at last settled himself atop a heap of stones to wait for the Serpent to go on his way and leave the road clear for him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="木偶害怕得无法形容。他离开它，跑了有半公里多，坐在一堆石头上，只等这条蛇爬开，把路让出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You must know, Mr. Serpent, that I am going home where my father is waiting for me. It is so long since I have seen him! Would you mind very much if I passed?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"I beg your pardon, Mr. Serpent, would you be so kind as to step aside to let me pass?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对不起，蛇先生，请帮个忙，挪出点地方让我过去，好吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He might as well have talked to a wall. The Serpent never moved.</div>

<div class="line_en">At the sight of the Marionette kicking and squirming like a young whirlwind, the Serpent laughed so heartily and so long that at last he burst an artery and died on the spot.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="蛇看见木偶头朝下，两脚用难以想象的速度踢来踢去，就扭啊扭地狂笑起来，笑啊，笑啊，笑啊，最后笑得太厉害，肚子上一根静脉竟断掉了：这回它真的死啦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Is he dead, I wonder?" said Pinocchio, rubbing his hands together happily. Without a moment's hesitation, he started to step over him, but he had just raised one leg when the Serpent shot up like a spring and the Marionette fell head over heels backward.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“它真的死了吗？……”皮诺乔说着，高兴得搓了搓手。他一点不耽搁，就要打它身上跳过去，跳到路的那一边。可他脚还没举起，蛇忽然像进起来的弹簧似地跳了起来。木偶大吃一惊，赶紧往后退，绊了一下，跌倒在地上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He fell so awkwardly that his head stuck in the mud, and there he stood with his legs straight up in the air.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="跌得也真不巧，他的脑袋插在路上的泥浆里，只剩两条腿倒竖着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The poor Marionette was caught in a trap set there by a Farmer for some Weasels which came every night to steal his chickens.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可怜的木偶是给一个捕兽夹夹住了。这种捕谷夹是农民装在那里捕捉大鸡貂的。要知道，鸡貂是附近所有鸡埘的大灾星。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">No sooner had he reached the grapevine than -- crack! went his legs.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他一到葡萄藤底下，卡嗒……只觉得两脚给两块很锋利的铁片一下夹住，痛得他眼冒金星。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Pinocchio freed himself from his awkward position and once more began to run in order to reach the Fairy's house before dark. As he went, the pangs of hunger grew so strong that, unable to withstand them, he jumped into a field to pick a few grapes that tempted him. Woe to him!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是皮诺乔重新跑起来，要在天黑之前赶到仙女的家。可路很长，肚子饿得慌。他再也忍耐不住，就跳进一块葡萄地，想采两串膨香葡萄吃。唉，真不该跳进去的！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He waited for some sign of an answer to his questions, but the answer did not come. On the contrary, the green Serpent, who had seemed, until then, wide awake and full of life, became suddenly very quiet and still. His eyes closed and his tail stopped smoking.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他等着蛇作出个表示来回答他这个请求，可蛇没有动静。相反，它一直好像很生猛，这时倒变得僵直不动了。它的眼睛闭上，尾巴停止冒烟。">查看中文翻译</div>
