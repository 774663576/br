<div class="line_en">I sat down on the edge of a deep soft chair and looked at Mrs. Regan. She was worth a stare. She was trouble. She was stretched out on a modernistic chaise-longue with her slippers off, so I stared at her legs in the sheerest silk stockings. They seemed to be arranged to stare at. They were visible to the knee and one of them well beyond. The knees were dimpled, not bony and sharp. The calves were beautiful, the ankles long and slim and with enough melodic line for a tone poem. She was tall and rangy and strong-looking. Her head was against an ivory satin cushion. Her hair was black and wiry and parted in the middle and she had the hot black eyes of the portrait in the hall. She had a good mouth and a good chin. There was a sulky droop to her lips and the lower lip was full.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="椅子铺了厚厚的软垫，我坐在边缘，望着里根太太。她大有看头。她能兴风作浪。她脱了拖鞋，手脚伸开躺在一张现代主义风格的卧榻上，那双穿了透明长筒丝袜的腿令我目不转睛。膝盖以下都露了出来，有一条腿更是变本加厉。膝盖颇为肉感，有浅浅的小窝。腿肚很漂亮，脚踝细长，线条优美得足以谱出一首交响诗。她身材高挑，四肢修长，看上去挺健硕。她头靠一只象牙色缎面软垫。头发又黑又挺，中分，那双炽热的黑眼眸神似大厅里的画中人。她有着标致的嘴和标致的下颌。她的嘴略带郁闷地垂着，下唇很丰满。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This room was too big, the ceiling was too high, the doors were too tall, and the white carpet that went from wall to wall looked like a fresh fall of snow at Lake Arrowhead. There were full-length mirrors and crystal doodads all over the place. The ivory furniture had chromium on it, and the enormous ivory drapes lay tumbled on the white carpet a yard from the windows. The white made the ivory look dirty and the ivory made the white look bled out. The windows stared towards the darkening foothills. It was going to rain soon. There was pressure in the air already.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那房间太大，天花板太远，门太高，从屋子一边铺到另一边的白色地毯就像箭头湖[1]刚积起的一场雪。到处都有大穿衣镜和水晶小摆设。象牙色的家具镀了铬，窗前一码的地方，一块巨大的象牙色窗帘垂到白地毯上。白色让象牙色显得有点脏，而经象牙色一衬，白色白得好像流光了最后一滴血一样。窗户正对着渐渐阴沉的山脚。快下雨了。气压已然很低。【注：[1]Lake Arrowhead：南加州旅游胜地。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh, Dad wouldn't hear of the police being brought into it." She looked at me smoothly across her glass again, emptied it, and rang a bell. A maid came into the room by a side door. She was a middle-aged woman with a long yellow gentle face, a long nose, no chin, large wet eyes. She looked like a nice old horse that had been turned out to pasture after long service. Mrs. Regan waved the empty glass at her and she mixed another drink and handed it to her and left the room, without a word, without a glance in my direction.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“噢，爸爸不想让警方参与进来。”她隔着杯子又平和地看了我一眼，喝光酒，按了一下电铃。一个女仆从侧门走了进来。是个中年妇女，一张和蔼的长脸，面色泛黄，长鼻子，没有下巴，泪汪汪的大眼睛。她像一匹忠厚的老马，在长久的劳作后终于被主人放出去吃草了。里根太太对着她晃了晃空酒杯，她又调了一杯酒递上去，便走出了房间，一句话不说，扫都不往我这边扫一眼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm not crazy about yours," I said. "I didn't ask to see you. You sent for me. I don't mind your ritzing me or drinking your lunch out of a Scotch bottle. I don't mind your showing me your legs. They're very swell legs and it's a pleasure to make their acquaintance. I don't mind if you don't like my manners. They're pretty bad. I grieve over them during the long winter evenings. But don't waste your time trying to cross-examine me."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可你的做派我也没有爱得发狂啊，”我说，“我并没要求见你。是你叫我来的。你怠慢我也好，喝掉一整瓶威士忌当午饭也罢，我都不在乎。我不在乎你露出腿来给我看。这两条腿漂亮极了，能认识它们真荣幸。你不喜欢我的做派，我也不在乎。确实烂透了。漫漫冬夜，我常为此伤心难过。但别浪费时间试图盘问我了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I stood on the step breathing my cigarette smoke and looking down a succession of terraces with flowerbeds and trimmed trees to the high iron fence with gilt spears that hemmed in the estate. A winding driveway dropped down between retaining walls to the open iron gates. Beyond the fence the hill sloped for several miles. On this lower level faint and far off I could just barely see some of the old wooden derricks of the oilfield from which the Sternwoods had made their money. Most of the field was public park now, cleaned up and donated to the city by General Sternwood. But a little of it was still producing in groups of wells pumping five or six barrels a day. The Sternwoods, having moved up the hill, could no longer smell the stale sump water or the oil, but they could still look out of their front windows and see what had made them rich. If they wanted to. I didn't suppose they would want to.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我站在台阶上，一边吞云吐雾，一边看着下方层层低下去的花坛和修剪整齐的树，尽头是环绕庄园的一圈铁栅栏，高耸，布满镀金尖刺。一条车行道蜿蜒而下，从挡土墙通到两扇敞开的铁门前。栅栏外面的几英里山路尽是斜坡。在这片模糊不清的遥远平地上，我隐隐看到几个破旧的木头井架，斯特恩伍德家族当年就是靠底下的油田发财的。油田的大半如今已辟为公园，是斯特恩伍德将军派人拾掇干净后捐给市政府的。但少数几组油井还在生产，每天能抽满五六桶。斯特恩伍德一家早已搬到山上居住，他们再也闻不到腐臭的污水和石油的气味，却依然可以望向窗外，看看曾经的摇钱树。他们有兴致的话。我不认为他们还会想这么做。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She had lovely legs. I would say that for her. They were a couple of pretty smooth citizens, she and her father. He was probably just trying me out; the job he had given me was a lawyer's job. Even if Mr. Arthur Gwynn Geiger, Rare Books and De Luxe Editions, turned out to be a blackmailer, it was still a lawyer's job. Unless there was a lot more to it than met the eye. At a casual glance I thought I might have a lot of fun finding out.</div>
