<div class="line_en">They all knew it, but perhaps Johnny most of all. So, although the three of them didn't talk about the future, they felt its shadowy presence constantly, and somehow that made their time together sweeter and more intense. On the rare night when they weren't working on a story, Johnny, Tully, and Kate met at Goldies to play pool and drink beer. By the end of their second year together, they knew all there was to know about each other; at least, all that each was willing to share.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大家都知道，而强尼更是体会深刻。虽然他们三个闭口不提以后的事，但未来如同一片总是存在的阴影，但也因此使他们的关系更融洽、更紧密。偶尔不需要加班赶报道时，强尼、塔莉和凯蒂会相约在歌蒂酒吧打桌球、喝啤酒。共事即将两年了，他们知道对方所有的事情，除了各自不愿分享的那些。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">From the moment Tully did her first on-air broadcast, everything changed. They became the fearsome foursome; Kate and Tully and Mutt and Johnny. For two years they were together constantly, huddled together in the office, working on stories, going from place to place like gypsies. The second story that Tully covered was about a snowy owl who'd taken up residence on a streetlamp in Capitol Hill. Next, she followed the gubernatorial campaign of Booth Gardner, and though she was one of dozens of reporters on the case, it seemed that Gardner often answered her questions first. By the time the first Microsoft millionaires began driving through downtown in their mint-new Ferraris, listening to geek music on supersized headphones, everyone at KCPO knew that Tully wouldn't last on the smallest local channel for long.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="自从塔莉第一次上电视播报后，所有事情都发生了变化。他们四个人成为无坚不摧的团队：凯蒂、塔莉、马特与强尼，接下来两年，他们经常一起行动，在办公室头脑风暴、制作新闻，如吉普赛人般赶往一个个地点。塔莉第二次播报的新闻是关于一只雪鸮，它在“首都丘”的街灯上筑巢，之后，她又负责追踪加德纳的州长竞选连任的活动，虽然有数十个记者同时采访，但加德纳经常优先回答她的问题。第一批微软新贵头戴超大耳机听宅男音乐、开着崭新法拉利在街头呼啸而过，KCPO的同仁都知道塔莉很快会出人头地，离开这个小小的地区电视台。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And besides, what did Tully know about unrequited love? Her friend would just start pushing Kate to ask Johnny out. What would Kate say then? I can't. He's in love with you. Deeper down, in a dark place she rarely acknowledged, there was another fear, one she only recognized in her dreams and nightmares. In the cold light of day, she didn't believe it, but at night, alone, she worried that if Tully found out about Kate's love, it might actually make Johnny more attractive to Tully. That was the thing about her best friend; it wasn't that she wanted what she couldn't have. It was that she wanted everything, and sooner or later, Tully got what she wanted. Kate couldn't risk it. Not having Johnny she could live with. Losing him to Tully would be unbearable.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="更何况，塔莉怎么可能了解暗恋的心情？塔莉只会逼她约强尼出去，到时候她该怎么说？不行，因为他喜欢你。她内心深处有一个自己都不敢承认的黑暗角落，只有在梦中才会看见，在朗朗白日下她不会相信，但夜晚独处时她会担心，万一塔莉发现她的感情，说不定强尼在塔莉眼里将突然变得很有吸引力。塔莉的毛病并非渴望得不到的东西，而是所有东西她都要，而且迟早能得手。凯蒂不敢冒险，她可以接受无法拥有强尼，但无法看着他被塔莉抢走。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So their weird, silent triangle went on, day after day, night after night. Tully always asked Kate why she didn't date. She longed to come clean, tell Tully the truth, but every time she started to confess, she backed out. How could she tell the truth about Johnny, after the crap she'd given Tully about Chad? Your boss, after all, was worse than your professor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="日复一日，夜复一夜，这段怪异的三角关系持续着，没有人打破僵局。塔莉总是问凯蒂为何不交男朋友，她很想说出心事，老实对塔莉坦承一切，但每次准备开口时又打退堂鼓。塔莉和查德刚开始在一起时她义正词严地劝诫，现在又怎么有办法说出她喜欢强尼？毕竟老板是比教授更不恰当的对象。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She tried not to be alone with Johnny too much, either, just to stay on the safe side. Although she no longer fumbled things or got tongue-tied around him, she always sensed that he was quite perceptive, and that, given too many opportunities, he might sense that which she worked so hard to hide.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="为了安全起见，她尽可能不和强尼独处。虽然在他面前她不会再手忙脚乱或舌头打结，但她知道他的观察力很敏锐，假使给他太多机会，她拼命隐藏的秘密很可能被看穿。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So Kate kept her head down, her hands busy, and her dreams of love hidden away. She smiled easily when Mom or Dad or Tully teased her about her social life, joked that her standards were higher than some people she could name, an answer which was always good for a laugh.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是凯蒂保持低调、忙碌，将爱情的梦想深深埋藏。爸、妈和塔莉常取笑她不交男朋友，她总是一笑置之，推说她的标准很高，然后提出认识的人做比较，每次总能逗得大家哈哈大笑。">查看中文翻译</div>

By the end of the first day, she had a pounding headache.</div>

<div class="line_en">She learned another lesson that first week, too. Life went on. The head honchos in Tacoma still called, and a producer was assigned to oversee the assignments the team was given, but in truth, the way it worked out, Kate began to take over some of the producing responsibilities. Mutt and Tully trusted her, and she knew how to make things work on the shoestring budget they'd been given. All that longing of hers had paid off; it seemed she'd watched Johnny closely enough that she knew how to do his job. She was a seamstress to his couturier, of course, but still, she was competent. By Thursday of the first week, the out-of-town producer had thrown up his hands, said he had better things to do than follow crazy people around all day, and returned to Tacoma.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在第一个星期中，她也学到了另一课。塔科马的台长还是会打电话来督导，并派了一位制作人过来管理这个团队，然而实际上，凯蒂慢慢开始接手制作的工作。马特和塔莉信任她，她懂得如何善用最少预算维持运作。她的单恋总算有点好处，因为她平时仔细观察强尼，所以知道该怎么处理他的工作。当然，相较于他大师级的功力，她顶多只是个小学徒，不过她的能力足以应付。到了第一周的星期四，总部派来的制作人举双手投降，说他有更要紧的事情，没有闲工夫整天追着疯子跑，就这样回塔科马去了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I always thought Katie and I would be on air together, an anchoring team, but I guess I was wrong," Tully had said. "She'll be the producer of my show someday instead. And when Barbara Walters interviews me, I'll say I couldn't have done it without her."</div>
