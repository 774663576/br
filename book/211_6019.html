<div class="line_en">The dairymaids and men had flocked down from their cottages and out of the dairy-house with the arrival of the cows from the meads; the maids walking in pattens, not on account of the weather, but to keep their shoes above the mulch of the barton. Each girl sat down on her three-legged stool, her face sideways, her right cheek resting against the cow; and looked musingly along the animal's flank at Tess as she approached. The male milkers, with hat-brims turned down, resting flat on their foreheads and gazing on the ground, did not observe her.</div>

<div class="line_en">The milkers formed quite a little battalion of men and maids, the men operating on the hard-teated animals, the maids on the kindlier natures. It was a large dairy. There were nearly a hundred milchers under Crick's management, all told; and of the herd the master-dairyman milked six or eight with his own hands, unless away from home. These were the cows that milked hardest of all; for his journey-milkmen being more or less casually hired, he would not entrust this half-dozen to their treatment, lest, from indifference, they should not milk them fully; nor to the maids, lest they should fail in the same way for lack of finger-grip; with the result that in course of time the cows would 'go azew' -- that is, dry up. It was not the loss for the moment that made slack milking so serious, but that with the decline of demand there came decline, and ultimately cessation, of supply.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="挤牛奶的工人是由男人和姑娘组成的一小支队伍，男人们挤的是硬奶头的牛，姑娘们侍候的则是脾气比较温顺的牛。这是一个大奶牛场。把所有的牛都算起来，克里克管理的奶牛有一百头；在这一百头牛里，有六头或八头牛是奶牛场老板自己动手挤奶，除非是他出门离开了家。那些牛都是所有牛中最难挤的奶牛；因为他偶尔要或多或少地雇些临时工，他不放心把这些牛交给他们，怕他们做事不认真，不能把牛奶完全挤干净；他也不放心把它们交给姑娘们，怕她们手指头缺少力气，同样挤不干净；过了一段时间，结果这些奶牛就都要回了奶——那就是说，再也不出奶了。奶挤不干净的严重性倒不在于出奶量的暂时损失，而是在于牛奶挤得少，它就出得少，最后就完全停止出奶了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">'To my thinking,' said the dairyman, rising suddenly from a cow he had just finished off, snatching up his three-legged stool in one hand and the pail in the other, and moving on to the next hard-yielder in his vicinity; 'to my thinking, the cows don't gie down their milk to-day as usual. Upon my life, if Winker do begin keeping back like this, she'll not be worth going under by midsummer.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“照我看呀，”奶牛场老板说，他刚挤完了奶，一手抓着三脚凳，一手拎着牛奶桶，突然从奶牛身后站起来，向附近的另一头难挤的奶牛走去。“照我看呀，今天这些奶牛出奶和平常有些不同。我敢肯定，要是温克尔这头牛真的开始像这样回奶，不到仲夏，它就一滴奶也没有了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After Tess had settled down to her cow there was for a time no talk in the barton, and not a sound interfered with the purr of the milk-jets into the numerous palls, except a momentary exclamation to one or other of the beasts requesting her to turn round or stand still. The only movements were those of the milkers' hands up and down, and the swing of the cows' tails. Thus they all worked on, encompassed by the vast flat mead which extended to either slope of the valley -- a level landscape compounded of old landscapes long forgotten, and, no doubt, differing in character very greatly from the landscape they composed now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苔丝在奶牛身边坐下来挤奶以后，一时间院子里的人谁也不说话了，偶尔除了一两声有人要牛转向或站着不动的吆喝外，听见的都是牛奶被挤进许多牛奶桶里的噗噗声。所有的动作只是挤奶工人们的双手一上一下挤奶的动作，以及奶牛尾巴的来回摆动。他们就这样不停地工作着，他们的四周是广大平坦的草场，一直伸展到山谷两边的斜坡上——这片平坦的风景是由早已被人遗忘的古老风景组成的，而且那些古老的风景同由它们构成的现在的风景比起来，毫无疑问已是天壤之别了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Songs were often resorted to in dairies hereabout as an enticement to the cows when they showed signs of withholding their usual yield; and the band of milkers at this request burst into melody -- in purely business-like tones, it is true, and with no great spontaneity; the result, according to their own belief, being a decided improvement during the song's continuance.

A reply, in the shape of 'Why?'came as it were out of the belly of a dun cow in the stalls; it had been spoken by a milker behind the animal, whom she had not hitherto perceived.</div>

<div class="line_en">'Oh yes; there's nothing like a fiddle,' said the dairyman. 'Though I do think that bulls are more moved by a tune than cows -- at least that's my experience. Once there was a old aged man over at Mellstock -- William Dewy by name -- one of the family that used to do a good deal of business as tranters over there, Jonathan, do ye mind? -- I knowed the man by sight as well as I know my own brother, in a manner of speaking. Well, this man was a coming home-along from a wedding where he had been playing his fiddle, one fine moonlight night, and for shortness' sake he took a cut across Forty-acres, a field lying that way, where a bull was out to grass. The bull seed William, and took after him, horns aground, begad; and though William runned his best, and hadn't much drink in him (considering 'twas a wedding, and the folks well off), he found he'd never reach the fence and get over in time to save himself. Well, as a last thought, he pulled out his fiddle as he runned, and struck up a jig, turning to the bull, and backing towards the corner. The bull softened down, and stood still, looking hard at William Dewy, who fiddled on and on; till a sort of a smile stole over the bull's face. But no sooner did William stop his playing and turn to get over hedge than the bull would stop his smiling and lower his horns towards the seat of William's breeches. Well, William had to turn about and play on, willy-nilly; and 'twas only three o'clock in the world, and 'a knowed that nobody would come that way for hours, and he so leery and tired that 'a didn't know what to do. When he had scraped till about four o'clock he felt that he verily would have to give over soon, and he said to himself, "There's only this last tune between me and eternal welfare! Heaven save me, or I'm a done man." Well, then he called to mind how he'd seen the cattle kneel of Christmas Eves in the dead of night. It was not Christmas Eve then, but it came into his head to play a trick upon the bull. So he broke into the 'Tivity Hymn, just as at Christmas carol-singing; when, lo and behold, down went the bull on his bended knees, in his ignorance, just as if 'twere the true 'Tivity night and hour. As soon as his horned friend were down, William turned, clinked off like a long-dog, and jumped safe over hedge, before the praying bull had got on his feet again to take after him. William used to say that he'd seen a man look a fool a good many times, but never such a fool as that bull looked when he found his pious feelings had been played upon, and 'twas not Christmas Eve... Yes, William Dewy, that was the man's name; and I can tell you to a foot where's he a-lying in Mellstock Churchyard at this very moment -- just between the second yew-tree and the north aisle.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，是的；什么也比不上提琴，”奶牛场老板说。“尽管我确实认为公牛比母牛更容易受到音乐的感动——至少这是我的经验。从前梅尔斯托克有一个老头儿——名字叫威廉·杜伊——他家里从前是赶大车的，在那一带做了不少的活儿，约纳森，你不在意吗？——也可以这么说，我见面就认识他，就像熟悉我的兄弟一样。哦，有一次他在婚礼上拉提琴，那是一个月光明媚的晚上，他在回家的路上为了少走一些路，就走了一条穿过名叫四十亩地的近路，在横在路中的那块田野里，有一头公牛跑出来吃草。公牛看见威廉，天呀，把头上的角一晃就追了过去；尽管威廉拼命地跑，而且酒他也喝得不多（因为那是婚礼，办婚事的人家也很有钱），但是他还是感到他没法及时跑到树篱跟前跳过去，救自己的命。唉，后来他急中生智，一边跑，一边把提琴拿出来，转身对着公牛拉起一支跳舞的曲子，一边倒着向角落里退去。那头公牛安静下来，站着不动了，使劲地看着威廉·杜伊，看着他把曲子拉了又拉；看到后来，公牛的脸上都悄悄露出一种笑容来了。可是就在威廉停下来刚要翻过树篱的时候，那头公牛就不再笑了，低下头要向威廉的胯裆触过去。啊，威廉不得不转过身去继续拉给它听，拉呀拉呀，不停地拉；那时还只是凌晨三点钟，他知道再有几个小时那条路上也不会有人来，他又累又饿，简直不知道怎么办才好。当他拉到大约四点钟的时候，他真不知道他是不是很快就要拉不下去了，就自言自语地说，“这是我剩下的最后一支曲子了！老天爷，救救我吧，莫让我把命丢了。”哦，后来他突然想起来他看见圣诞节前夕的半夜里有头牛下跪的事来。不过那时候不是圣诞节前夕，但是他突然想到要同那头公牛开个玩笑。因此，他就转而拉了一首“耶稣诞生颂”，就像圣诞节有人在唱圣诞颂歌一样；啊哈，你瞧，那头公牛不知道是开玩笑，就弯着双腿跪了下去，似乎真的以为耶稣诞生的时刻到了。威廉等到他那长角的朋友一跪下去，就转过身去像一条猎狗蹿起来，祈祷的公牛还没有站起来向他追过去，他已经跳过树篱平安无事了。威廉曾经说过愚蠢的人他见得多了，但从没有见过那头公牛发现那天原来不是圣诞节而自己虔诚的感情受到欺骗时那种傻样的……对了，威廉·杜伊，这就是那个人的名字；这阵儿他埋在梅尔斯托克教堂院子里，什么地方我都能说得一点儿不差——他就埋在教堂北边的走道和第二棵紫杉中间那块地方。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But the details of his aspect were temporarily thrust aside by the discovery that he was one whom she had seen before. Such vicissitudes had Tess passed through since that time that for a moment she could not remember where she had met him; and then it flashed upon her that he was the pedestrian who had joined in the club-dance at Marlott -- the passing stranger who had come she knew not whence, had danced with others but not with her, had slightingly left her, and gone on his way with his friends.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是苔丝暂时把他外表上的这些细节放到了一边，因为他发现他是她以前见过的一个人。自从他们那次相遇之后，苔丝已经历尽沧桑，因而一时竟记不起在那儿见过他；后来心里一亮，她才想起来他就是那个曾在马洛特村参加过他们村社舞会的过路人——就是那个她不知道从哪儿来的过路的陌生人，不是同她而是同另一个女孩子跳过舞，离开时又冷落她，上路同他的朋友们一起走了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tess could then see him at full length. He wore the ordinary white pinner and leather leggings of a dairy-farmer when milking, and his boots were clogged with the mulch of the yard; but this was all his local livery. Beneath it was something educated, reserved, subtle, sad, differing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="直到这时候苔丝才看见他的全身。他系一条普通的白色围裙，腿上打着奶牛场挤奶工人打的绑腿，靴子上沾满了院子里的烂草污泥；不过所有这些装束都是本地的装束。在这种外表之下，看得出来他受过教育，性格内向，性情敏感，神情忧郁和与众不同。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The flood of memories brought back by this revival of an incident anterior to her troubles produced a momentary dismay lest, recognizing her also, he should by some means discover her story. But it passed away when she found no sign of remembrance in him. She saw by degrees that since their first and only encounter his mobile face had grown more thoughtful, and had acquired a young man's shapely moustache and beard -- the latter of the palest straw colour where it began upon his cheeks, and deepening to a warm brown farther from its root. Under his linen milking-pinner he wore a dark velveteen jacket, cord breeches and gaiters, and a starched white shirt. Without the milking-gear nobody could have guessed what he was. He might with equal probability have been an eccentric landowner or a gentlemanly ploughman. That he was but a novice at dairy-work she had realized in a moment, from the time he had spent upon the milking of one cow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她回想起在她遭受了不幸以前发生的那件小事，对过去的回忆像潮水一样涌了上来，使她暂时生发出一阵忧郁，害怕他认出她来，并设法发现她的经历。不过她在他身上看不出他有记得的迹象，也就放心了。她还逐渐看见，自从他们第一次也是仅有的一次相遇以后，他那生动的脸变得更为深沉了，嘴上已经长出了年轻人有的漂亮胡须了——下巴上的胡须是淡淡的麦秸色，已经长到了两边的脸颊，逐渐变成了温暖的褐色。他在麻布围裙里面穿一件深色天鹅绒夹克衫，配一条灯芯绒裤子，扎着皮绑腿，里面穿一件浆洗过的白衬衫。要是他没有穿那件挤牛奶的围裙，没有人能够猜出他是谁。他完全可能是一个怪癖的地主，也完全可能是一个体面的农夫。从他给那头母牛挤奶所费的时间上，苔丝立刻就看出来，他只不过是在奶牛场干活的一个新手。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Meanwhile many of the milkmaids had said to one another of the new-comer, 'How pretty she is!' with something of real generosity and admiration, though with a half hope that the auditors would qualify the assertion -- which, strictly speaking, they might have done, prettiness being an inexact definition of what struck the eye in Tess. When the milking was finished for the evening they straggled indoors, where Mrs Crick, the dairyman's wife -- who was too respectable to go out milking herself, and wore a hot stuff gown in warm weather because the dairymaids wore prints -- was giving an eye to the leads and things.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就在此时，许多挤牛奶的女工们已经开始互相谈论起她这个新来的人，“她多么漂亮呀！”这句话里带有几分真正的慷慨，几分真心的羡慕，尽管也带有一半希望，但愿听话的人会对这句评价加以限制——严格说来，姑娘们也只能找到这句评价了，因为漂亮这个词是不足以表现她们的眼睛所看到的苔丝的。大家挤完了当晚的牛奶，陆陆续续地走进屋内。老板娘克里克太太因为自恃身分，不肯到外面亲自挤牛奶，就在屋里照料一些沉重的锅盆和杂事；也因为女工们都穿印花布，所以在暖和天气里她还穿着一件闷热的毛料衣服。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Only two or three of the maids, Tess learnt, slept in the dairy-house besides herself; most of the helpers going to their homes. She saw nothing at supper-time of the superior milker who had commented on the story, and asked no questions about him, the remainder of the evening being occupied in arranging her place in the bed-chamber. It was a large room over the milk-house, some thirty feet long; the sleeping-cots of the other three indoor milkmaids being in the same apartment. They were blooming young women, and, except one, rather older than herself. By bedtime Tess was thoroughly tired, and fell asleep immediately.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="苔丝已经听说，除她而外，只有两三个挤牛奶的女工在奶牛场的屋子里睡觉；大多数雇工都是回他们自己家里睡。吃晚饭的时候，她没有看见那个评论故事的挤牛奶的上等工人，也没有问起过他，晚上剩余的时间她都在寝室里安排自己睡觉的地方。寝室是牛奶房上方的一个大房间，大约有三十英尺长；另外三个在奶牛场睡觉的女工的床铺也在同一个寝室里。她们都是年轻美貌的女孩子，只有一个比她年纪小，其他的都比她的年纪大些。到睡觉的时候苔丝已经筋疲力尽，一头倒在床上立即睡着了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But one of the girls who occupied an adjoining bed was more wakeful than Tess, and would insist upon relating to the latter various particulars of the homestead into which she had just entered. The girl's whispered words mingled with the shades, and, to Tess's drowsy mind, they seemed to be generated by the darkness in which they floated.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，在和她毗邻的一张床上睡觉的女孩子，不像苔丝那样很快就能入睡，坚持要讲讲她刚刚加入进来的这户人家的一些琐事。女孩子的喃喃细语混合着沉沉的夜色，在半睡半醒的苔丝听来，它们似乎是从黑暗中产生的，而且漂游在黑暗里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'Yes -- that he is -- the earnestest man in all Wessex, they say the last of the old Low Church sort, they tell me -- for all about here be what they call High. All his sons, except our Mr Clare, be made pa'sons too.'</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的——他很热心——他们说他是全威塞克斯最热心的人——他们告诉我，他是低教派的最后一个了——因为这儿的牧师基本上都被称作高教派。他所有的儿子，除了克莱尔先生外也都做了牧师。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">'Mr Angel Clare -- he that is learning milking, and that plays the harp -- never says much to us. He is a pa'son's son, and is too much taken up wi' his own thoughts to notice girls. He is the dairyman's pupil -- learning farming in all its branches. He has learnt sheep-farming at another place, and he's now mastering dairy-work... Yes, he is quite the gentleman-born. His father is the Reverent Mr Clare at Emminster -- a good many miles from here.'</div>
