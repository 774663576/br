<div class="line_en">Cheng Xin rode the elevator to the surface. Exiting the elevator station, she saw the plaza where the deterrence handover ceremony had taken place an hour ago. All the attendees had left, and the place was empty save for the long shadows cast by the flagpoles. The flags of the UN and the Solar System Fleet hung from the two tallest poles, and behind them were the flags of the various nations. The flags continued to flap tranquilly in the light breeze. Beyond them was the endless Gobi Desert. A few twittering birds landed in a stand of tamarisk nearby. In the distance, she could see the rolling Qilian Mountains, the snow cover on a few peaks giving them a silvery highlight.</div>

<div class="line_en">She walked forward aimlessly. When she exited the gates of the compound, two guards saluted her. She was terrified of facing people, but she saw nothing but curiosity in their eyes -- they didn't yet know what had happened. Regulations permitted the Swordholder to come onto the surface for brief intervals, and they must have thought she had come up to investigate the quake. Cheng Xin saw a few military officers standing next to a flying transport parked by the gate. They weren't even looking at her, merely in the direction she had come from. One of them pointed in that direction.</div>

<div class="line_en">After the failure, most people immediately pointed to the small number of gravitational wave transmitters as a cause, and blamed people from the early Deterrence Era for dismantling nineteen of the twenty-three completed transmitters. But this reaction represented a failure to grasp the substance of the problem. From data gathered during the droplet attack, a droplet needed slightly more than ten seconds on average to penetrate the crust and destroy a transmitter. Even if the planned one hundred transmitters had been completed and deployed, it wouldn't have taken long for droplets to destroy the entire system.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="威慑失败后，人们首先想到的是引力波发射器太少了，当初把已经建成的二十三个发射台中的二十个拆除是一个错误。但这种想法没有抓住问题的实质。根据监测数据，水滴穿入地层摧毁一个发射台所需的时间平均只有十几秒钟，即使计划中的一百个发射台全部建成并部署，水滴摧毁整个系统也用不了多少时间。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The most important factor in the failure of deterrence was, of course, electing the wrong Swordholder. This is a topic that will be addressed elsewhere in a dedicated chapter.

<div class="line_en">The problem wasn't the number of transmitters, but where they were deployed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="问题不在于引力波发射台的数量，而在于它们部署的位置。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Imagine if the twenty-three transmitters had not been built on or below the surface, but in space -- that is, twenty-three spaceships like Gravity. Normally, the ships would be scattered around the Solar System. Even if the droplets had conducted a surprise attack, it would be difficult for them to destroy all of them. One or more of the ships would have time to escape into deep space.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="设想如果已经建造的二十三个发射台不是位于地面而是在太空。也就是说建造二十三艘“万有引力”号飞船，平时各飞船拉开距离分散在太阳系不同的位置，即使水滴发动突然袭击，也很难全部消灭它们，必然有一艘或多艘飞船逃脱追击消失在太空深处。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This would have greatly increased the degree of deterrence for the whole system, in a way that would not have been dependent on the Swordholder. The Trisolarans would have known that they controlled insufficient forces within the Solar System to completely destroy the deterrence system, and would have behaved with far more restraint.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这样黑暗森林威慑系统的威慑度便增加很多，而且，所增加的威慑度与执剑人无关。当三体世界意识到，凭他们在太阳系的力量不可能完全摧毁威慑系统，他们对自己的冒险可能会谨慎许多。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Regrettably, there was only one Gravity.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="遗憾的是，“万有引力”号只有一艘。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There were two reasons that more ships with transmitters weren't built: First, there was the "Sons of the Earth" attack on the transmitter in Antarctica. Spaceships were deemed even more vulnerable to threats from extremist humans than underground stations. Second, it was a matter of economics. Since gravitational wave antennas were immense, they had to serve as the hull of the ship itself. Thus, the antenna had to be constructed out of materials that met the requirements of spaceflight, which increased costs many times. Gravity itself cost almost the equivalent of the twenty-three ground-based transmitters added together. Moreover, the hull of the ship itself could not be refreshed; when the vibrating string made of degenerate matter that ran the length of the ship reached its fifty-year half-life limit, a completely new gravitational wave ship had to be built.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没有建造多艘引力波飞船的原因有两个：其一是“地球之子”对南极引力波发射台的袭击。在这方面，对于来自人类的威胁，引力波发射飞船与地基发射台相比更不安全，有着更多的不确定因素。其二是经济原因。由于引力波发射天线体积巨大，引力波飞船的天线只能是船体本身，这样天线材料还要满足宇航的要求。成本更是成倍增长，建造“万有引力”号的费用几乎是地球上二十三个发射台的总和。同时，飞船的船体不可能更新，所以当贯穿船体的简并态振动弦达到五十年的半衰期而失效时。飞船的发射功能消失，只能制造新的引力波飞船。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But the deeper root cause could only be found in the minds of humankind. Never explicitly stated, and perhaps not even consciously understood, a gravitational wave ship was too powerful -- so powerful that it terrified its creator. If something -- a droplet attack or something else -- forced such ships to depart for deep space, and they could never return to the Solar System due to the presence of enemy threats, they would turn into copies of Blue Space and Bronze Age, or something even more horrific. Each gravitational wave ship, with its no-longer-human crew, would also possess the power to broadcast to the universe (though limited by the half-life of the vibrating string), thus controlling the fate of humanity. A frightful instability would be permanently scattered among the stars.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但更深层的原因潜藏在人们意识深处，从来没有被说出甚至可能没有被意识到：引力波飞船太强大了，强大到它的建造者自己都害怕。如果发生事变。水滴的袭击或其他原因迫使引力波飞船飞向太空深处，且由于太阳系内存在的威胁永远不能返航，它们就成为新的“蓝色空间”号和“青铜时代”号，或变成什么更不确定更可怕的东西，同时，它们拥有引力波宇宙广播的能力（虽然不会超过振动弦的半衰期），因而掌握着人类世界的命运！那样，一种恐怖的不确定性将永远播撒到太空中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Cheng Xin walked toward the officers and asked them to take her to the site of the eruption. A lieutenant colonel in charge of security for the compound immediately dispatched two cars: one to take her, the other to carry a few guards for security. Cheng Xin asked AA to stay and wait for her, but AA insisted on coming and got into the car.</div>

<div class="line_en">He couldn't have imagined that the "volcano' had once hidden the strategic fulcrum for the world: the gravitational wave antenna. The first eruption was caused by the impact of the droplet penetrating the crust. After destroying the antenna, it retraced its path and emerged from the ground, causing a second eruption. The eruptions were due to the droplet releasing its tremendous kinetic energy in the ground, not an outburst of material from the mantle, so they were very brief. The extremely high velocity of the droplet meant that it could not be observed by the naked eye as it penetrated or emerged from the ground.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他做梦也想不到，火山下面就是这个世界曾经的战略支点—引力波发射天线。第一次火山喷发是水滴穿人地层时产生的，它摧毁天线后沿原路穿出地层，引发了第二次喷发。山于喷发主要是由水滴在地层中释放的巨大动能所引起，并非地慢中的物质喷出，所以都很短暂。水滴速度极快，穿人和飞出地表时肉眼是看不到的。">查看中文翻译</div>

As they proceeded, the pits grew denser, and a thick layer of smoke hovered over the Gobi, revealing burning stands of tamarisk here and there. Though few people lived out here they occasionally saw old buildings collapsed by the quake. The whole scene resembled a battlefield where the fighting had just finished.</div>

AA's eyes burned with fury as she stared at Sophon; she picked up a rock from the ground with both hands and smashed the back of Sophon's skull with it.

Sophon unsheathed the katana on her back, easily pushing off the pleading Cheng Xin with her other hand, and twirled the katana.

<div class="line_en">As the gravitational wave broadcast system had been destroyed and the sun's ability to amplify radio waves had been suppressed, a living Cheng Xin posed no threat. On the other hand, in the unlikely event that humans still possessed some other method of broadcasting to the universe unknown to Trisolaris, eliminating the Swordholder might cause others to activate the broadcast. As long as the Swordholder was alive, however, the probability of that happening was virtually nil: Others would have a reason and excuse to shirk their responsibility.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在引力波发射系统被摧毁、太阳电波放大功能被压制的情况下，程心活着也做不了什么；进一步推测：如果人类还掌握着三体世界所不知道的其他宇宙广播手段（可能性极小），在执剑人被消灭的情况下，可能会有别的人启动广播，但执剑人存在时这种可能性就会小许多，因为那些人有了依靠和推脱的理由。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Cheng Xin remembered that she had seen Sophon's katana in that eastern leaf-house shrouded in fog and cloud. Back then, it, and two shorter swords, had rested on a refined wooden stand next to the tea table, looking more decorative than deadly.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="程心注意到智子手中的武士刀，她曾在那幢云雾中的东方别墅里见过，当时它与另外两把短些的倭刀一起放在茶案上一个精致的木刀架上，都装在鞘中，看上去那么无害。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The Trisolarans had been planning and preparing for this moment for a long time.

<div class="line_en">"In our personality studies, your degree of deterrence hovered around ten percent, like a worm wriggling on the ground. Luo Ji's degree of deterrence was always around ninety percent, like a fearsome cobra poised to strike. But Wade --" Sophon gazed at the setting sun behind the smoke, only a sliver of which now was above ground. Terror glinted from her eyes. She shook her head vigorously, as though trying to chase away a mirage in her mind. "He had no curve at all. No matter what the other environmental parameters were, his degree of deterrence stayed at one hundred percent! What a devil! If he had become the Swordholder, none of this would have been possible. This peace would have had to last. We've already waited sixty-two years, but we'd have had to keep on waiting, maybe for fifty more years, or even longer. And then Trisolaris would face an Earth equal to us in technology and power. We'd have to compromise… However, we knew that humanity would choose you."</div>
