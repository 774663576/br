<div class="line_en">"For a living," said Ursula drily.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“为了生存。”厄休拉木然答道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Ursula Bourne, it seemed, was one of a family of seven impoverished Irish gentlefolk. On the death of her father, most of the girls were cast out into the world to earn their own living. Ursula's eldest sister was married to Captain Folliott. It was she whom I had seen that Sunday, and the cause of her embarrassment was clear enough now. Detemined to earn her living and not attracted to the idea of being a nursery governess -- the one profession open to an untrained girl, Ursula preferred the job of parlourmaid. She scorned to label herself a "lady parlourmaid." She would be the real thing, her reference being supplied by her sister. At Fernly, despite an aloofness which, as has been seen, caused some comment, she was a success at her job -- quick, competent, and thorough.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="厄休拉·波恩家里有七口人——是家道中落的爱尔兰名门世家。父亲去世后，家中的大多数姑娘不得不外出谋生。厄休拉的大姐嫁给了弗里奥特上尉，我上星期天拜访的就是她。现在就不难理解当时她坐立不安的原因了。厄休拉决意自力更生，但她不想去当保姆——那种工作任何未经训练的姑娘都能胜任。厄休拉选择了客厅女仆的工作。但她不屑于以“贵族小姐出身的客厅女仆”自居，而是真真正正想做好客厅女仆的分内事。她姐姐为她出具了介绍信。在芬利庄园，她的与众不同招来了非议，然而她的工作无可挑剔——手脚麻利、吃苦耐劳、办事周全。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But to people like Ralph Paton, turning over a new leaf is easier in theory than in practice. He hoped that his stepfather, whilst still in ignorance of the marriage, might be persuaded to pay his debts and put him on his feet again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但对拉尔夫·佩顿这种人而言，要想改过自新真是说起来容易做起来难。他希望一面把结婚的事瞒着继父，一面又能说服继父替他还债，扶持他重新立足。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But the revelation of the amount of Ralph's liabilities merely enraged Roger Ackroyd, and he refused to do anything at all. Some months passed, and then Ralph was bidden once more to Fernly. Roger Ackroyd did not beat about the bush. It was the desire of his heart that Ralph should marry Flora, and he put the matter plainly before the young man.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但罗杰·艾克罗伊德一听说拉尔夫欠钱的金额，顿时大发雷霆，不肯拉他一把。几个月后，拉尔夫又被召回芬利庄园。罗杰·艾克罗伊德直接抛出一个天大的难题：他希望拉尔夫能迎娶弗洛拉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I enjoyed the work," she explained. "And I had plenty of time to myself." And then came her meeting with Ralph Paton, and the love affair which culminated in a secret marriage. Ralph had persuaded her into that, somewhat against her will. He had declared that his stepfather would not hear of his marrying a penniless girl. Better to be married secretly, and break the news to him at some later and more favourable minute.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我喜欢这份工作，”她解释说，“而且有很多自由支配的时间。”接着她就谈到如何与拉尔夫·佩顿相识、相恋，最后暗结连理。这不是厄休拉的本意，但最后拉尔夫说服了她。他声称不能让继父知道他娶了穷人家的姑娘，所以最好先秘密结婚，等时机成熟再告诉他。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And so the deed was done, and Ursula Bourne became Ursula Paton. Ralph had declared that he meant to pay off his debts, find a job, and then, when he was in a position to support her, and independent of his adopted father, they would break the news to him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是厄休拉·波恩成了厄休拉·佩顿。拉尔夫说他想先还清债务，找份工作，等到有能力养活她、不必再依赖继父时，再向他公开婚讯。">查看中文翻译</div>

</div>
<div class="line_en">Then came the crucial moment when Roger Ackroyd, always high-handed, decided to announce the engagement. He said no word of his intention to Ralph -- only to Flora, and Flora, apathetic, raised no objection. On Ursula, the news fell like a bombshell. Summoned by her, Ralph came hurriedly down from town. They met in the wood, where part of their conversation was overheard by my sister. Ralph implored her to keep silent for a little while longer, Ursula was equally determined to have done with concealments. She would tell Mr Ackroyd the truth without any further delay. Husband and wife parted acrimoniously.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="决定性的时刻来到了，一贯专横独断的罗杰·艾克罗伊德决定公布两个年轻人的婚讯。他在拉尔夫面前只字不提，只找弗洛拉谈了谈。弗洛拉虽态度冷淡，但也不反对。但对于厄休拉来说，这一消息无异于晴天霹雳。她急忙将拉尔夫从城里叫回来，二人在小树林中私会——正是被我姐姐偷听到的那一次。拉尔夫乞求她暂时别声张，但厄休拉坚决不同意躲躲藏藏，决定马上将真相告知艾克罗伊德先生，刻不容缓。夫妻俩大吵一架，不欢而散。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And here it was that the innate weakness of Ralph Paton showed itself. As always, he grasped at the easy, the immediate solution. As far as I could make out, neither Flora nor Ralph made any pretence of love. It was, on both sides, a business arrangement. Roger Ackroyd dictated his wishes -- they agreed to them. Flora accepted a chance of liberty, money, and an enlarged horizon, Ralph, of course, was playing a different game. But he was in a very awkward hole financially. He seized at the chance. His debts would be Paid. He could start again with a clean sheet. His was not a nature to envisage the future, but I gather that he saw vaguely the engagement with Flora being broken off after a decent interval had elapsed. Both Flora and he stipulated that it should be kept a secret for the present. He was anxious to conceal it from Ursula. He felt instinctively that her nature, strong and resolute, with an inherent distaste for duplicity, was not one to welcome such a course.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="至此，拉尔夫·佩顿再次暴露了他的性格缺陷。他重蹈覆辙，选择了最简单、最直接的解决方式。从厄休拉的陈述不难听出，弗洛拉和拉尔夫之间没有爱情；对双方来说，这都不过是一笔交易而已。这桩婚事对弗洛拉意味着自由、财富以及远大前程，而拉尔夫自然另有打算。他的经济状况日益恶化，这次机会无异于一根救命稻草，可以让他还清债务，从头开始。拉尔夫并不是那种善于计划长远之事的人，但估计他也预料到，将来和弗洛拉解除婚约只是时间问题。弗洛拉和他约好暂时不公布婚事，他也想方设法瞒着厄休拉。因为他本能地意识到，厄休拉坚韧果决的个性容不得欺骗，绝不可能赞成这种安排的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Ursula, steadfast in her purpose, sought an interview with Roger Ackroyd that very afternoon, and revealed the truth to him. Their interview was a stormy one -- it might have been even more stormy had not Roger Ackroyd been already obsessed with his own troubles. It was bad enough, however. Ackroyd was not the kind of man to forgive the deceit that had been practised upon him. His rancour was mainly directed to Ralph, but Ursula came in for her share, since he regarded her as a girl who had deliberately tried to "entrap" the adopted son of a very wealthy man. Unforgivable things were said on both sides.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="厄休拉主意已定，就于当天下午直接找罗杰·艾克罗伊德摊牌。他们的对话火药味十足——要不是罗杰·艾克罗伊德已经麻烦缠身，还会吵得更凶。但局面仍然在恶化。艾克罗伊德不会轻易谅解欺骗他的人。基本上他把怒火都发泄在了拉尔夫头上，但厄休拉也不免受到连累，因为艾克罗伊德认为她处心积虑“勾引”大富翁的养子。双方彻底翻脸。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That same evening Ursula met Ralph by appointment in the small summer-house, stealing out from the house by the side door in order to do so. Their interview was made up of reproaches on both sides. Ralph charged Ursula with having irretrievably ruined his prospects by her ill-timed revelation. Ursula reproached Ralph with his duplicity.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这天晚上，厄休拉如约溜出侧门，去凉亭见拉尔夫。这次会面演变成两人的互相指责。拉尔夫责怪厄休拉不合时宜地泄露天机，毁了他的前程；而厄休拉则斥责拉尔夫玩弄感情。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They parted at last. A little over half an hour later came the discovery of Roger Ackroyd's body. Since that night Ursula had neither seen nor heard from Ralph.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="两人分开后才半小时多一点，罗杰·艾克罗伊德的尸体就被发现了。那天晚上之后，厄休拉再也没见过拉尔夫，也没收到他的消息。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As the story unfolded itself, I realized more and more what a damning series of facts it was. Alive, Ackroyd could hardly have failed to alter his will -- I knew him well enough to realize that to do so would be his first thought. His death came in the nick of time for Ralph and Ursula Paton. Small wonder the girl had held her tongue, and played her part so consistently.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="听了厄休拉的一番话，我越来越惊觉这一系列事实多么可怕。如果艾克罗伊德活着，必定会修改遗嘱——我太了解他了，他第一件要办的事就是这个。而他的死对拉尔夫与厄休拉而言无异于一场及时雨。无怪乎厄休拉闭口不言，继续扮演客厅女仆的角色了。">查看中文翻译</div>

Major Blunt was walking up and down the terrace, so I had to go round through the bushes to avoid him. It must have been about twenty-seven minutes to ten when I reached the summer-house. Ralph was waiting for me. I was with him ten minutes -- not longer, for it was just a quarter to ten when I got back to the house."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“您以为我没有在心里反复确认吗？我出去见他时正好九点半。布兰特少校在露台上散步，为了避开他，我只好绕远路穿过树丛。我到达凉亭的时间应该是九点三十三分左右。拉尔夫已经在那儿等我了。我和他一起待了十分钟——不会比这更久，因为我回到屋里时刚好九点四十五分。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“哪能伤到他啊。”卡洛琳说，“不用担心你对男人都说过些什么，他们都相当自以为是，除了奉承话，什么都听不进去。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I was so cruel to him that night -- so hard and bitter. I wouldn't listen to what he was trying to say -- wouldn't believe that he really cared. I just stood there telling him what I thought of him, and saying the coldest, cruellest things that came into my mind -- trying my best to hurt him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那天晚上我对他太残忍了——那么强硬、那么刻薄。我应该试着听他解释的——但我不相信他真的在乎我，只顾把我对他的所有看法全部倒出来，用了我能想到的一切最冷酷、最无情的词——我是在不遗余力地伤害他。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"When the murder was discovered and he didn't come forward, I was terribly upset. Just for a moment I wondered -- but then I knew he couldn't -- he couldn't… But I wished he would come forward and say openly that he'd had nothing to do with it. I knew that he was fond of Dr Sheppard, and I fancied that perhaps Dr Sheppard might know where he was hiding." She turned to me. "That's why I said what I did to you that day. I thought, if you knew where he was, you might pass on the message to him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“谋杀案发生后，他一直没露面，我好担心。我本来还猜测——但马上我就坚信他不会——他不会⋯⋯可是我希望他能回来澄清自己。我知道，他很信赖谢泼德医生，没准谢泼德医生知道他躲在什么地方。”她扭头对我说，“所以那天我才会把我所做的一切都告诉您，心想如果您知道他的藏身之处，应该会转告给他的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
