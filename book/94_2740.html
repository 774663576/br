<div class="line_en">Granny's fairy tales from Miamas were fairly dramatic, as a rule. Wars and storms and pursuits and intrigues and stuff, because these were the sorts of action stories that Granny liked. They were hardly ever about everyday life in the Land-of-Almost-Awake. So Elsa knows very little about how monsters and wurses get along, when they don't have armies to lead and shadows to fight.</div>

<div class="line_en">It starts with the wurse totally losing its patience with The Monster when The Monster tries to wash the floor under the wurse while the wurse is still lying on it, and then, because The Monster is extremely reluctant to touch the wurse, he accidentally spatters some alcogel in its eye. Elsa has to intervene to stop a full-blown fight, and later when The Monster with extreme frustration insists that Elsa must put one of those blue plastic bags on each of the wurse's paws, the wurse thinks it's gone far enough. In the end, once twilight is falling outside and she's certain that the police are not still hanging about on the stairs, Elsa forces them both outside into the snow, to give herself a bit of peace and quiet to think over the situation and decide what to do next.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一切是这样开始的：当怪物试图清洗呜嘶身下那块地板时，呜嘶还躺在上面，并且完全失去了耐心，而怪物又极度不愿意碰触到呜嘶，他不小心溅了一点儿洗手液到呜嘶的眼睛里。爱莎必须出面阻止这场大战。后来怪物忍无可忍了，他要求爱莎必须给呜嘶的每只脚爪套上一个蓝色鞋套，呜嘶则认为这太过分。暮色终于降临，爱莎确认警察已经离开楼道，便把他俩都赶到外面雪地里去，给屋里点儿清静，好让自己想想现在的状况并决定下一步该怎么做。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She would have worried about being seen by Britt-Marie from the balcony, except that it's six o'clock sharp and Britt-Marie and Kent have their dinner at exactly six o'clock because "only barbarians" eat their dinner at any other time. Elsa nestles her chin into her Gryffindor scarf and tries to think clearly. The wurse, still looking quite offended by the blue plastic bags, backs into a bush until only its nose is sticking out of the branches. It stays there, its eyes focused on Elsa with a very dissatisfied expression. It takes almost a minute before The Monster sighs and makes a pointed gesture.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她本应该担心布里特—玛丽会从阳台上看见他们，但现在是六点整，布里特—玛丽和肯特总是在六点整吃晚餐，因为“只有野蛮人”才会在其他时间用餐。爱莎把下巴埋进格兰芬多围巾里，想要好好思考一下。呜嘶看上去还是对蓝色鞋套很生气，退到了灌木丛里，只有鼻子露在外面。它待在那儿，用特别委屈的眼神盯着爱莎。差不多过了一分钟，怪物才叹了口气，用手指戳着空气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Crapping," mumbles The Monster, and looks the other way.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“胡来。”怪物喃喃自语，转开了视线。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Sorry," says Elsa guiltily to the wurse and turns away. They are using normal language again, because something in Elsa's stomach turns into a dark lump when she talks in the secret language to anyone but Granny. Either way, The Monster doesn't seem too keen on any language. Meanwhile, the wurse looks like you or I might if someone came barging in while you were attending to nature's needs, and it took a while before they understood how inappropriate it was to stand there gawking. Only then does Elsa realize that it actually can't have had a chance to relieve itself for several days, unless it did so inside its flat. Which she rules out because she can't see how it could have maneuvered itself into using a toilet, and it certainly wouldn't have crapped on the floor, because this is not the sort of thing a wurse would demean itself by doing. So she assumes that one of the wurse's superpowers is clenching.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对不起。”爱莎内疚地对呜嘶说，然后转过身。他们现在又讲起了正常语言，在爱莎心里，始终觉得对外婆之外的人说秘密语言让她很不爽。不管怎样，怪物似乎也并不在意用哪种语言。呜嘶则是一副正准备解决生理需求却被人打断的样子。过了一会儿，他们才发现站在这儿发呆有多不妥，爱莎也才意识到它已经好几天没有机会上厕所了，除非它在自己的公寓里这么干。她排除了这种情况，因为它显然没法自己使用马桶，当然也不会直接在地板上排泄，这不是一只呜嘶会屈尊去做的事情。所以她推测呜嘶的超能力之一大概就是憋住生理冲动。">查看中文翻译</div>

Granny always sort of made her plans as she went along, and now that she's no longer there Elsa is having problems recognizing what the next step of the treasure hunt is supposed to be.

Up until now Elsa has only found out that Granny had some pretty dodgy friends, which was hardly a shock, you might say.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最终，她沉浸在自己的思绪中。这也许就是她没注意到它的原因。她想着外婆和密阿玛斯，想知道外婆让她去寻宝到底有什么计划，当然前提是有任何计划。外婆总是边行动边制定计划，现在她不在了，爱莎很难搞明白这场寻宝游戏的下一步是什么。更重要的是，她想知道，外婆说的“当你知道我的过去时，不要恨我”到底是什么意思。到目前为止，爱莎只发现外婆有一些非常不靠谱的朋友，那对她而言没什么奇怪的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And she knows that The Monster will never get anywhere near the fence even for her sake, because schools are full of children and children are full of bacteria, and there's not enough alcogel in the whole world for The Monster after that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="而她知道怪物不会为她靠近围墙，因为学校里全是孩子，而孩子们身上满是细菌，如果他来了，那之后全世界的洗手液都不够他用。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the first break she allows herself a walk along the fence. She tightens her backpack straps from time to time, to make sure it isn't hanging too loose. She knows they won't be chasing her now, but it's a difficult habit to break. You run slower if your backpack's loose.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第一节课下课时，她沿着围墙走了一圈，时不时地拉紧背包肩带，以确保它不会太松。她知道他们现在不会追她，但拉紧肩带是个很难打破的习惯，如果你的背包松了，你就无法跑快。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But she enjoys her freedom that morning in spite of all. It's the second-to-last day before the Christmas holidays and after tomorrow she can have a couple of weeks of rest from running. A couple of weeks without notes in her locker about how ugly she is and how they're going to kill her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="总之，她很享受这天早上的自由。这是圣诞节假期前的倒数第二天，后天她就可以歇上几个星期。几个星期没有储物柜里的纸条——那些写着她有多丑、他们将如何揍她的字条。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And Elsa obviously understands that Granny's statement about who she was before she became a granny must have something to do with Elsa's mum, but she'd rather not ask Mum unless she has to. Everything Elsa says to Mum these days seems to end in an argument. And Elsa hates it. She hates that one can't be allowed to know things unless one starts arguing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爱莎当然明白，外婆声称的“变成外婆之前，她是怎样的人”，这一定与妈妈有关，但不到万不得已，她不想问妈妈。这些天里，爱莎对妈妈说的一切话似乎都在争吵中结束。爱莎讨厌这样。她讨厌一个人只有通过争吵才能获取事情的真相。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">So it must be for that reason that she doesn't notice it. Because she's probably no more than two or three yards away when she finally sees it, which is an insane distance not to see a wurse from. It's sitting by the gate, just outside the fence. She laughs, surprised. The wurse seems to be laughing as well, but internally.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="所以一定是这个原因，让她没有注意到它。最终看见它的时候，他们相距只有两三米远，一般情况下你很难离这么近都没有看到一只呜嘶。它坐在校门口，就在围墙外面。她大笑起来，同时又很惊讶。呜嘶似乎也在笑，但是默默地没出声。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"I looked for you this morning," she says, and goes into the street, even though this is not allowed during breaks. "Were you nice to the ghosts?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我今天早上找你来着。”她走到街上，尽管休息时间不允许出校门。“你对鬼魂的态度好吗？”爱莎问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The wurse doesn't look as if it was, but she throws her arms around its neck all the same, buries her hands deep in its thick black fur, and exclaims: "Wait, I've got something for you!" The wurse greedily sticks its nose into her backpack, but looks remarkably disappointed when it pulls it back out again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="呜嘶看起来好像并没有按爱莎的要求做，但她还是抱住了它的脖子，把手深深地埋进它厚厚的黑毛里。“等等，我有东西给你！”呜嘶贪婪地把鼻子凑近她的背包，但很快就露出失望的表情，又把鼻子收了回去。">查看中文翻译</div>
