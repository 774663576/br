<div class="line_en">It was actually worse having her mad at me than having her harass me. Why? Because I'd screwed up, that's why. I had egg all over my face, and blaming it on her yard had done nothing to wash it off. The way she ignored me, or so obviously avoided me, was a screaming loud reminder to me that I'd been a jerk. A royal cluck-faced jerk.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then one day I'm coming home from hanging out with Garrett after school, and there's Juli in her front yard, hacking at a shrub. She is thrashing on the thing. Branches are flying over her shoulder, and clear across the street I can hear her grunting and growling and saying stuff like, "No… you… don't! You are coming… off… whether you like it or… not!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后有一天放学我和加瑞特玩完之后回家，朱莉就在她的前院，砍着一丛灌木。她十分凶狠地对待着它们。树枝飞过她的肩膀，在街对面我都能听见不满地低声咆哮着：“不，你不能！都给我下…来，不管你喜欢还是…不喜欢！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It didn't take long for me to realize that I'd traded in my old problems with Juli Baker for a whole new set of problems with Juli Baker. I could feel her anger a mile away.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我对此感到高兴吗？不，我的朋友，我没有。是的，他们的院子是一团糟，而这的确是时候有人做些什么了，但是——爸爸呢？马特和迈克呢？为什么是朱莉？因为我把她弄得很尴尬，这是为什么。我感觉糟透了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">So I snuck inside and tried to ignore the fact that here's my desk and here's my window, and right across the street from me is Juli, beating up a bush. Not conducive to concentration. No siree, Bob. I got all of zero homework done.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我进了屋，试着无视这事实，那是我的书桌，那是我的窗户，而街道正对面是朱莉，砍着灌木丛。精神无法集中。完全不行。我的功课一点都没动。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then on the ride home I had this thought. It kind of freaked me out at first, but the more I played with it, the more I figured that, yeah, helping her with the yard would make up for my having been such a jerk. Assuming she didn't boss me too much, and assuming she didn't decide to get all gooey-eyed or something stupid like that. No, I'd go up and just tell her that I felt bad for being a jerk and I wanted to make it up to her by helping her cut back some bushes. Period. End of story. And if she still wanted to be mad at me after that, then fine. That was her problem.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后回家的路上我有了一个想法。它开始让我惊讶，但是我越想，越觉得，是的，帮助她打扫院子会让我觉得没那么坏。假设她没有指使我，假设她没有总缠着我或做些愚蠢的事。不，我会到那儿去告诉她我感觉很糟做了一个坏人，而我想帮她砍掉灌木作为补偿。完了，这就结束了。然后如果她还想对我生气的话，那好吧。这是她的问题了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I crouched behind a neighbor's hedge and watched them for ten or fifteen minutes, and man, the longer I watched, the madder I got. My grandfather had already said more to her in this little slice of time than he'd said to me the whole year and a half he'd been living with us. What was his deal with Juli Baker?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我蹲在一个邻居的树篱后面观察了他们十或十五分钟，天，我越看越觉得生气。我外公在这点时间对她说的话比整整一年半对我说的都多。他和朱莉·贝克在一起做什么呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I took the back way home, which involved climbing two fences and kicking off the neighbor's stupid little terrier, but it was worth it, considering I avoided the garden party across the street.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我从后面的小路回家，这需要爬过两排篱笆，踢走邻居的蠢狗，但是很值得，考虑到我避开了街对面的花园聚会。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Now, jump back. This was not something I could immediately absorb. My grandfather did not do yard work. At least, he'd never offered to help me out. My grandfather lived in house slippers -- where'd he get those work boots? And those jeans and that flannel shirt -- what was up with those?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在，先回去。这可不是我能够突然接受的事。我外公没有做过院子的工作。至少，他从没自愿帮助过我。我外公总是穿着拖鞋在家——他在哪儿找到那些工作靴的？还有那条牛仔裤和那件法兰绒衬衫——这是怎么一回事？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Again I got no homework done. The more I watched them, the madder I got. I was still a cluck-faced jerk, while Juli was laughing it up with my grandfather. Had I ever seen him smile? Really smile? I don't think so! But now he was knee- high in nettles, laughing.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="我爸爸只是在开玩笑，但我不认为外公这么想。他拿了一块沾上奶酪的土豆，“把盐给我好吗，布莱斯？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="但是他没有放弃。他反而说：“为什么是这个女孩终于开始管他们的地方？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At dinner that night he'd showered and changed back into his regular clothes and house slippers, but he didn't look the same. It was like someone had plugged him in and turned on the light.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天晚上晚餐时他换上他平常的衣服和拖鞋出现了，但是他看起来不一样了。看起来就像有人给他插上了插座，开启了灯，整个人容光焕发。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">My grandfather salted his potato very carefully, then looked across the table at me. Ah-oh, I thought. Ah- oh. In a flash I knew those stupid eggs were not behind me. Two years of sneaking them in the trash, two years of avoiding discussion of Juli and her eggs and her chickens and her earlymorning visits, and for what? Granddad knew, I could see it in his eyes. In a matter of seconds he'd crack open the truth, and I'd be as good as fried.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="外公很仔细地给土豆撒上盐，然后看着桌子对面的我。啊哦，我想。啊哦。一瞬间我知道那些愚蠢的鸡蛋问题还没结束。两年以来一直偷偷扔掉它们，两年来一直避开讨论朱莉和她的鸡蛋和鸡还有她早上的探访，为了什么？外公知道了，我从他的眼睛就能看出。在过一会儿他就会说出真相，而我就会被烧焦。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">For a guy who'd only basically ever said Pass the salt to me, my granddad turned out to be a real talker. We walked our neighborhood and the next neighborhood and the next neighborhood, and not only did I find out that my granddad knows a lot of stuff, I found out that the guy is funny.
