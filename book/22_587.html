<div class="line_en">We leave, just as we have planned, on the last day of April. Richard's stay is complete. My uncle's prints are mounted and bound: he takes me to view them, as a sort of treat. "Fine work," he says. "You think, Maud? Hmm?"</div>

<div class="line_en">At last she has nothing more to show. We must only wait. We take our lunch. We walk to my mother's grave. I stare at the stone, feeling nothing.

<div class="line_en">I think of the ghost I shall make: a neat, monotonous ghost, walking for ever on soft-soled feet, through a broken house, to the pattern of ancient carpets. But perhaps, after all, I am a ghost already. For I go to Sue and she shows me the gowns and linens she means for us to take, the jewels she means to shine, the bags she will fill; but she does it all without meeting my gaze; and I watch, and say nothing. I am more aware of her hands than of the objects she takes up; feel the stir of her breath, see the movement of her lip, but her words slip from my memory the moment she has said them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我想到我将造就的那个鬼魂：一个干净整齐，单调乏味的鬼魂，总是穿着软底鞋走路，穿过一间破屋子，走到古旧地毯的图案前。然而，或许，我已经是个鬼魂了。因为我来到苏身边，她给我看我们要带走的裙子和亚麻衣裳，她打算擦亮的珠宝，她要装满东西的袋子；而她做着这些，始终不看我的眼睛；我在一旁看着，一言不发。我更多地注意到她的双手，而不是她收拾的家什；我感受着她呼吸引起的气流，我望着她嘴唇阖动，可她的言语从我脑中滑将过去，左耳进右耳出。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I have surrendered myself to Richard's plan, as I once gave myself to my uncle. The plot, the flight -- they seem fired, now, not so much by my wants as by his. I am empty of want. I sit at my supper, I eat, I read; I return to Sue and let her dress me as she likes, take wine when she offers it, stand at the window at her side. She moves fretfully, from foot to foot. "Look at the moon," she says softly, "how bright it is! Look at the shadows on the grass. -- What time is it?

<div class="line_en">I go stealthily from the room. I know my way, I do not need a lamp, and my dark dress hides me. I go to the head of the stairs, cross quickly the broken carpets of moonlight that the windows there throw upon the floor. Then I pause, and listen. Silence. So then I go on, into the corridor which faces mine, along a path which is the mirror of the path that has led from my own rooms. At the first door I pause again, and listen again, to be sure that all is still within. This is the door to my uncle's rooms. I have never entered here, before. But, as I guess, the handle and hinges are kept greased, and turn without a sound. The rug is a thick one, and makes a whisper of my step.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我潜出房间。不需灯火我也知该如何走，深色的衣裳掩护了我。我走到楼梯口，月光透过窗格在地上撒下零落投影，我从月光里快速通过，然后停下倾听周围动静。一片寂静。于是我继续走，走进面前的长廊，那条走廊与去我房间的走廊对称布置，我沿着那走廊一直走。在第一个房门口，我又停住，再次附耳倾听，确定房里并无响动。这是我舅舅的房门。以前我未来过这儿。不过，不出我所料，门把手和铰链都上了油，门毫无声息地打开了。门垫颇厚实，我脚踏上去发出细微的唏嗦声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There is only one thing I mean to do, before I go: one deed -- one terrible deed -- the vision of which has risen, to goad and console me, through all the bitten-down rages, the dark and uneasy sleeps, of my life at Briar; and now, as the hour of our flight nears, as the house falls silent, still, unsuspecting, I do it. Sue leaves me, to look over our bags. I hear her, unfastening buckles. -- That is all I wait for.</div>

<div class="line_en">I go quickly and take them up -- the chain uncurling softly, I feel it slither against my glove. If it should fall! -- It does not fall. The door-key swings like a pendulum. The razor is heavier than I expect, the blade is free of its clasp, at an angle, showing its edge. I pull it a little freer, and turn it to the light: it must be sharp, for what I want it for. I think it is sharp enough. I lift my head. In the glass above the mantel, picked out against the shadows of the room, I see myself -- my hands: in one a key, in the other a blade. I might pass for a girl in an allegory. Confidence Abused.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我快步上前，拿起这两样东西——表链软绵绵地垂下，在我手套上滑动着。假使它落到地上——！它没落到地上。书房钥匙如钟摆似的摇荡着。那剃刀比我预想中重，刀身从刀柄中脱出，与刀柄摆成个角度，刀锋亮出来。我将刀身又拉开些，拿到灯光下：为达成我要凭它达成的心愿，这剃刀必须锋利。我觉得这刀够锋利。我抬起头。在壁炉架上的镜子中，我于房间的重重暗影里看到自己——我的双手：一手拿着钥匙，一手拿着剃刀。我会被人看成寓言中的姑娘。刚愎自用。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He has his bed-curtains pulled close but keeps a light, as I do, upon a table: this seems curious to me, I should never have supposed him to be nervous of the dark. But the dim light helps me. Without moving from my place beside the door, I look about me; and at last see the two things I have come to take. On his dressing-stand, beside his jug of water: his watch-chain with, upon it, the key to his library, bound in faded velvet; and his razor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他将床帷拉得颇严实，却象我一样在桌上留了盏灯：这灯令我颇意外，我从未想过他也怕黑。而这昏暗灯光有助于我。我立在门边，没有挪动，环顾周围；终于看到我来取的那两样东西：在他盥洗台上，放在水壶边儿上：他的表链，上面拴着他书房的钥匙，裹在钥匙上的天鹅绒已秃了毛儿；旁边是他的剃刀。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">His drawing-room is even darker, and seems smaller, than mine: he has hangings upon the walls, and more book-presses. I don't look at them. I go to his dressing-room door, put my ear to the wood; take the handle and turn it. One inch, two inches, three. -- I hold my breath, my hand upon my heart. No sound. I push the door further, stand and listen again. If he stirs, I will turn and go. Does he move? For a second there is nothing. Still I wait, uncertain. Then comes the soft, even rasp of his breathing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他客厅比我的更暗，似乎也小了点：墙壁上挂着帷幔，书柜占了更多地方。我没看那书柜。我走到他卧室门前，将耳朵贴在门上；手抓住门把，转动起来。一寸，两寸，三寸——我屏住呼吸，手按心口。没发出声响。我将门又推开了一点儿，立在门边再次倾听。假使他惊醒，我就转身跑掉。他是不是动了一下？停了一秒，无事发生。我仍在忐忑观望。这时传来他的轻微鼻息，略显刺耳。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But this is not that kind of story. Not yet. I stand and watch him sleep for almost a minute; and then I leave him. I go as I have come -- carefully, silently. I go to the stairs, and from there to the library, and once inside that room I lock the door at my back and light a lamp. My heart is beating hardest, now. I am queasy with fear and anticipation. But time is racing, and I cannot wait. I cross to my uncle's shelves and unfasten the glass before the presses. I begin with The Curtain Drawn Up, the book he gave me first: I take it, and open it, and set it upon his desk. Then I lift the razor, grip it tight, and fully unclasp it. The blade is stiff, but springs the last inch. It is its nature to cut, after all. Still, it is hard -- it is terribly hard, I almost cannot do it -- to put the metal for the first time to the neat and naked paper. I am almost afraid the book will shriek, and so discover me. But it does not shriek. Rather, it sighs, as if in longing for its own laceration; and when I hear that, my cuts become swifter and more true.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过这可不是那种故事。还不到时候。我立在原地，看他熟睡；片刻后，我就离开了。我如何来，便如何去——仔细小心，悄无声息。我走到楼梯口，经楼梯口到了书房，一进入书房，我就将身后的门锁上，点起灯火。此刻，我心跳剧烈到极点。我因恐惧和期待而手足无措。但是时不我待。我穿过书房，走到我舅舅的书柜前，打开书架的玻璃柜门。我从他给我的第一本书——《帘幕大开》——开始行事：我将书抽出，翻开，放在他书桌上。随后我拿出剃刀，紧紧攥住，将刀打开。刀拉开时颇费力，拉到最后刀身却自行弹起。毕竟，这刀有其嗜血的天性。这事还是颇难办——太难办了，我简直下不了手——将利器置于整洁又光溜溜的纸张上。我生怕书会发出惨叫，于是便泄露了我的行径。书却并未惨叫。应当说，书在叹息，仿佛期盼着被划伤；当我听到叹息，我下刀更快更用力了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Behind me, the drapes to my uncle's bed do not quite meet. In the space between them a shaft of light -- so weak it is hardly light, but rather a lessening of darkness -- leads to his face. I have never seen him sleep before. In form he seems slight, like a child. The blanket is drawn to his chin, uncreased, pulled tight. His lips let out his breath in a puff. He is dreaming -- black-letter dreams, perhaps, or pica, morocco, calf. He is counting spines. His spectacles sit neatly, as if with folded arms, on the table beside his head. Beneath the lashes of one of his soft eyes there is a gleaming line of moisture. The razor is warming in my hand…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在我身后，我舅舅的床帷未完全闭合。床帷缝隙间透进一线光——那嬴弱的光线，与其说是光，倒不如说是褪了色的黑暗——正落在他脸上。此前我从未见过他睡觉的样子。看上去，他似乎颇脆弱，好象个孩子。毯子拽到下巴上，一丝不乱地紧绷着。他的气息从嘴里喷出来。他在做梦——可能梦见了黑体字，要么是十二磅因的字体，摩洛哥皮，小牛皮。他在计算书脊厚度。他的眼镜摆在枕边小桌上，规规矩矩仿佛抱着胳膊似的。他一边睫毛下有道发光的线，那是潮气。剃刀被我的手握热了…">查看中文翻译</div>

But then, we go by the servants' way, and the naked passages and stairs are strange to me, all this part of the house is strange to me. She keeps her hand in mine until we reach the basement door. Then she sets down her bag, so she may smear the key and the bolts with grease, to make them turn. She catches my eye and winks, like a boy. My heart aches in my breast.</div>

<div class="line_en">He keeps to the black part. The boat sits low upon the water -- a dark-hulled boat, slender, rising at the prow. The dark boat of my dreams. I watch it come, feel Sue's hand turn in mine; then step from her, take the rope he casts, let him guide me to my seat, unresisting. She comes beside me, staggering, her balance all gone. He braces the boat against the bank with a single oar, and as she sits, we turn, and the current takes us.</div>

<div class="line_en">What follows? I know that the journey upon the river is a smooth one: that I should like to keep upon the boat, but am made to leave it and mount a horse. I should be afraid of the horse, at any other time; but I sit lifelessly upon it now, letting it bear me -- as, I think, I would let it throw me, if it chose to. I remember the church of flint, the stalks of honesty, my own white gloves my hand, that is bared then passed from one set of fingers to another, then bruised by the thrusting of a ring. I am made to say certain words, that I have now forgotten. I remember the minister, in a surplice smudged with grey. I do not recall his face. I know that Richard kisses me. I remember a book, the handling of a pen, the writing of my name.

He moves away, agitatedly smoothing his hair behind his ears. A bag lies in his path, and he kicks it. "God damn it," he says. He takes off his coat, then tugs at the link in a cuff, begins to work savagely at one of his sleeves. "Must you stare so?" he says, as he bares his arm. "Haven't I already told you, you are safe?

<div class="line_en">"Very good," he says, watching me drink. "Not much longer, now. Why, how thin and pale you've grown! -- and Sue grows sleeker by the hour, like one of Mother Cream's black-faced sows. Get her into your best gown tomorrow, will you?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“很好，”他望着我喝下药水说道。“现在不用等太久了。瞧瞧，你变得多消瘦多苍白！——苏这会儿变得多丰润，就象克里姆大婶养的黑脸猪。明天你会让她穿你最好的裙子，你会吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I do. I will do anything, now, to bring an end to our long wait. I will pretend fear, and nervousness, and weeping, while he leans to caress or chide me. I will do it, not looking at Sue -- or else, looking at her slyly, desperately, to see if she colours or seems ashamed. She never does. Her hands, that I remember sliding upon me, pressing, turning, opening me up -- her hands, when they touch me now, are perfectly lifeless and white. Her face is closed. She only waits, as we do, for the coming of the doctors.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我会的。此时此刻，我会做任何事，将我们的漫长等待引向终点。当他躬身亲近我或责备我，我会装着害怕，装着紧张，装着哭泣。我会这么做，眼睛并不看苏——也会，心怀绝望地偷眼看她，看她是否神色改变，或者面露羞惭。她从未变色。她的双手，滑过我的身体，抚摸翻转，开启了我的生命，令我铭刻于心——此时，她双手白皙，触到我时仿佛是无生命的肢体。她面无表情。跟我们一样，她仅是等待着医生的光临。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He rides out, every other day, for news of my uncle. He smokes so many cigarettes the stain on his scorched forefinger spreads to the finger beside it. Now and then he lets me take a dose of my draught; but he always keeps hold of the bottle.</div>

<div class="line_en">The doctor looks at his colleague. "You hear," he says, "how well the account matches Mrs Rivers's own? It is quite remarkable! -- as if, in making a burden of her life, she seeks to hand that burden to another, better able to bear it. She has made a fiction of herself!" He returns to me. "A fiction, indeed," he says thoughtfully. "Tell me this, Miss Smith: does your mistress care for books? for reading?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="医生望着他的同事。“你听说，”他说道，“瑞富斯太太自己名下的户头里有多少钱吗？那是笔惊人的财富！——似乎，倒成了她生活中的一个负担，她孜孜以求，要将这负担转嫁到他人身上，以便更好地承受这些事儿。她自己制造出一个幻象！”他转向我。“一个幻象，确实是，”他思虑着说道。“跟我说说，史密斯小姐：你的女主人喜欢书籍吗？喜欢阅读吗？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I meet his gaze, but my throat seems to close, or be splintered, like the boards on the floor. I cannot answer. Richard speaks in my behalf. "My wife," he says, "was born to a literary life. Her uncle, who raised her, is a man dedicated to the pursuit of learning, and saw to her education as he might have seen to a son's. Mrs Rivers's first passion was books."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我看到他的目光，可我喉头好象堵住了，要么就是碎裂开了，就好象地上的木板。我无法作答。理查德替我说出来。“内人，”他说道，“出生于书香门第。她舅舅一生致力于求知治学，是他将她抚养成人，将她视为己出，当作自己的孩子。内人的第一嗜好就是书籍。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There you have it!" says the doctor. "Her uncle, an admirable gentleman I don't doubt. But the over-exposure of girls to literature -- The founding of women's colleges --" His brow is sleek with sweat. "We are raising a nation of brain-cultured women. Your wife's distress, I'm afraid to say, is part of a wider malaise. I fear for the future of our race, Mr Rivers, I may tell you now. And her wedding-night, you say, the start of this most recent bout of insanity? Could that" -- he drops his voice meaningfully, and exchanges a glance with the doctor who writes -- "be plainer?" He taps at his lip. "I saw how she shrank from my touch, when I felt for the pulse at her wrist. I noted, too, that she wears no marriage ring."</div>

He crosses and uncrosses his legs. At length he takes a cigarette from his pocket, and a match, and tries to draw down the carriage window. It will not come. His hands are damp, grow damper, and finally slide upon the glass. "Damn this!" he cries then. He rises, staggers, beats upon the ceiling for the driver to stop the horse, then fumbles with the key.

He stands at the fire and rattles the coins in his pocket, then bursts out: "God damn you, do you think I take food for you, for free?" He eats the bread-and-butter himself.

<div class="line_en">I do not answer. At last, with a curse, he gives it up. The day is darkening now -- or rather, the sky is darkening, as we draw close to the city. There come streaks of soot upon the glass. The landscape is slowly growing meaner. The cottages have begun to be replaced by wooden dwellings, some with broken windows and boards. The gardens are giving way to patches of weed; soon the weed gives way to ditches, the ditches to dark canals, to dreary wastes of road, to mounds of stones or soil or ashes. Still, Even ashes, I think, are a part of your freedom -- and I feel, despite myself, the kindling in me of a sort of excitement. But then, the excitement becomes unease. I have always supposed London a place, like a house in a park, with walls: I've imagined it rising, straight and clean and solid. I have not supposed it would sprawl so brokenly, through villages and suburbs. I've believed it complete: but now, as I watch, there come stretches of wet red land, and gaping trenches; now come half-built houses, and half-built churches, with glassless windows and slateless roofs and jutting spars of wood, naked as bones.</div>

The air smells riverish, rank. People watch us, curiously. That makes me walk faster. Soon we turn again, into a lane of crunching cinders. Here there are children, in a group: they are standing idly about a bird, which lurches and hops. They have tied its wings with twine. When they see us, they come and press close. They want money, or to tug at my sleeve, my cloak, my veil. Richard kicks them away. They swear for a minute, then return to the bird.

I think again of the room that is waiting for me: of the door, with its key that will turn; of the bed, on which I shall lie and sleep, and sleep -- I hesitate, one second more; then let him draw me into the passage. It is short, and ends with a flight of shallow stairs, leading downwards; and these, in turn, end at a door, on which he knocks. From beyond the door there comes at once the barking of a dog, then soft, quick footsteps, a grinding bolt. The dog falls silent.

She comes to me, she stands before me, her head weaves as she tries to catch the line of my features. She moves her mouth, wets her lips. Her gaze is still close and terribly eager. When she raises her blunt red hands to me, I flinch.-- "Richard," I say. But he still does nothing, and the woman's look, that is so awful and so strange, compels me. I stand and let her fumble for my veil. She puts it back. And then her gaze changes, grows stranger still, when she sees my face. She touches my cheek, as if uncertain it will remain beneath her fingers.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我望着理查德。我想他要说什么，要么带我继续走进去。可他从我胳膊里将手抽回，双臂交迭，十分悠闲。他面带微笑，却笑得很古怪。每个人都沉默不语。每个人都一动不动，除了那个白发女人。她站起来，走到桌边。她穿着塔夫绸衣裳，衣料嘻嗦有声。她面色深红，泛着红光。她朝我走来，站到我面前，脑袋上下晃着，试图看分明我样貌形体的线条。她张开嘴，舔了舔嘴唇。她目光中依旧充满情感，充满渴望。当她粗壮通红的手向我伸来，我退后一步。——“理查德，”我说道。而他仍旧袖手旁观，这女人神情如此骇人，如此诡异，令我无处遁形。我立在原地，任由她摸上我的面纱。她掀起面纱。当她看清我的脸，她眼神立刻变了，变得更诡异。她抚摸着我的脸颊，仿佛无法确信她手指触到的是我的脸。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She keeps her eyes on mine, but speaks to Richard. Her voice is thick with the tears of age, or of emotion.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then he flinches as, from another chair -- a rocking chair, that creaks as it tilts -- a white-haired woman leans to strike him. I suppose her the housekeeper. She has watched me, more closely and more eagerly than any of the others. She holds a bundle: now she puts it down and struggles from her seat, and the bundle gives a shudder. This is more astonishing than the lighted brazier, the coat of fur -- it is a sleeping, swollen-headed baby in a blanket.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然后他身子缩了一下，因为，从另一张椅子上——一张摇椅，一摇就咯吱作响——一个满头白发的女人歪过身子打了他一记。我猜她是管家。她一直望着我，比旁人更仔细也更热切。她抱着个包裹：这时她放下包裹，艰难地从椅子上站起来，包裹抖了一下。这比火盆和毛皮衣裳更令我吃惊——那是一个毯子包起的婴儿，婴儿在大模大样熟睡。">查看中文翻译</div>
