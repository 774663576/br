<div class="line_en">Winston picked his way up the lane through dappled light and shade, stepping out into pools of gold wherever the boughs parted. Under the trees to the left of him the ground was misty with bluebells. The air seemed to kiss one's skin. It was the second of May. From somewhere deeper in the heart of the wood came the droning of ring-doves.</div>

<div class="line_en">He was a bit early. There had been no difficulties about the journey, and the girl was so evidently experienced that he was less frightened than he would normally have been. Presumably she could be trusted to find a safe place. In general you could not assume that you were much safer in the country than in London. There were no telescreens, of course, but there was always the danger of concealed microphones by which your voice might be picked up and recognised; besides, it was not easy to make a journey by yourself without attracting attention. For distances of less than a hundred kilometres it was not necessary to get your passport endorsed, but sometimes there were patrols hanging about the railway stations, who examined the papers of any Party member they found there and asked awkward questions. However, no patrols had appeared, and on the walk from the station he had made sure by cautious backward glances that he was not being followed. The train was full of proles, in holiday mood because of the summery weather. The wooden-seated carriage in which he travelled was filled to overflowing by a single enormous family, ranging from a toothless great-grandmother to a month-old baby, going out to spend an afternoon with "in-laws" in the country, and, as they freely explained to Winston, to get hold of a little black-market butter.</div>

<div class="line_en">He looked up. It was the girl. She shook her head, evidently as a warning that he must keep silent, then, parted the bushes and quickly led the way along the narrow track into the wood. Obviously she had been that way before, for she dodged the boggy bits as though by habit. Winston followed, still clasping his bunch of flowers. His first feeling was relief, but as he watched the strong slender body moving in front of him, with the scarlet sash that was just tight enough to bring out the curve of her hips, the sense of his own inferiority was heavy upon him. Even now it seemed quite likely that when she turned round and looked at him she would draw back after all. The sweetness of the air and the greenness of the leaves daunted him. Already on the walk from the station the May sunshine had made him feel dirty and etiolated, a creature of indoors, with the sooty dust of London in the pores of his skin. It occurred to him that till now she had probably never seen him in broad daylight in the open. They came to the fallen tree that she had spoken of. The girl hopped over it and forced apart the bushes, in which there did not seem to be an opening. When Winston followed her, he found that they were in a natural clearing, a tiny grassy knoll surrounded by tall saplings that shut it in completely. The girl stopped and turned.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他抬起头来。是那个女孩。她摇摇头，显然告诫他别说话，接着，她分开树枝，沿着狭窄的小路，领着他急急地走进树林。很明显，她以前走过这条路，所以很熟练地避开那些水洼地。温斯顿跟着她，手里捧着花束。他最初的感觉是欣慰，但看着在他前面跃动着的结实而又苗条的身躯，系着的红腰带衬托出她优美的臀部，自惭形秽的感觉沉甸甸地压在心头。即使现在，只要她回过头来，看看他，她很可能就打道回府。温馨的空气和浓郁的树叶让他气馁。从车站一路走来，五月的阳光已经使他觉得自己肮脏、苍白，是一个闭门不出的家伙，皮肤上每个毛孔都沾满了伦敦的烟尘。直到现在他才想到，她可能还没有在大白天看过他。他们来到了她说过的那棵枯树前。女孩从上面跳过去，清理树丛，那儿看上去不会有什么空间。温斯顿跟过去，却发现他们到了一块天然的空地上，那是一个长着青草的小土墩，四周是挺拔的小树，把它严严实实地围了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The lane widened, and in a minute he came to the footpath she had told him of, a mere cattle-track which plunged between the bushes. He had no watch, but it could not be fifteen yet. The bluebells were so thick underfoot that it was impossible not to tread on them. He knelt down and began picking some, partly to pass the time away, but also from a vague idea that he would like to have a bunch of flowers to offer to the girl when they met. He had got together a big bunch and was smelling their faint sickly scent when a sound at his back froze him, the unmistakable crackle of a foot on twigs. He went on picking bluebells. It was the best thing to do. It might be the girl, or he might have been followed after all. To look round was to show guilt. He picked another and another. A hand fell lightly on his shoulder.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="小路宽了起来，一分钟后，他来到她说的那条小道，这只是灌木丛中牲畜踩出来的一条小路。他没有戴表，但多半还没有到下午三点。脚下的野风信子花开得很茂盛，无法不踩到它们。他弯下身子采起花来，为了打发时间，同时多少也有这个想法：他们见面时，他可以向女孩献上一束花。他采了一大束花，闻着淡淡的花香，这时背后传来的声音吓他一跳，这分明是脚踩树枝的喀嚓声。他继续采花。最好就这么做。这可能是那个女孩，或者就是他被跟踪了。四处张望显得心怀鬼胎。他采了一朵，又采了一朵。一只手轻轻地搭在了他的肩膀上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The next moment, it was hard to say by whose act, she was in his arms. At the beginning he had no feeling except sheer incredulity. The youthful body was strained against his own, the mass of dark hair was against his face, and yes! actually she had turned her face up and he was kissing the wide red mouth. She had clasped her arms about his neck, she was calling him darling, precious one, loved one. He had pulled her down onto the ground, she was utterly unresisting, he could do what he liked with her. But the truth was that he had no physical sensation, except that of mere contact. All he felt was incredulity and pride. He was glad that this was happening, but he had no physical desire. It was too soon, her youth and prettiness had frightened him, he was too much used to living without women -- he did not know the reason. The girl picked herself up and pulled a bluebell out of her hair. She sat against him, putting her arm round his waist.</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's this bloody thing that does it," she said, ripping off the scarlet sash of the Junior Anti-Sex League and flinging it onto a bough. Then, as though touching her waist had reminded her of something, she felt in the pocket of her overalls and produced a small slab of chocolate. She broke it in half and gave one of the pieces to Winston. Even before he had taken it he knew by the smell that it was very unusual chocolate. It was dark and shiny, and was wrapped in silver paper. Chocolate normally was dull-brown crumbly stuff that tasted, as nearly as one could describe it, like the smoke of a rubbish fire. But at some time or another he had tasted chocolate like the piece she had given him. The first whiff of its scent had stirred up some memory which he could not pin down, but which was powerful and troubling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“都是这红兮兮的东西作怪，”她说完就扯下青少年反性同盟的红色腰带扔在一根树枝上。接着，好像碰到了腰让她想起什么，她在工作服的口袋里摸着，拿出一小块巧克力。她掰成两半，把其中一块给了温斯顿。他甚至还没拿到手里，只凭味道就知道这不是一块普通的巧克力。这是有着光泽的黑巧克力，包着银纸。一般的巧克力深褐色，很疏松，闻起来几乎可以说就像烧垃圾的烟味。但他也尝过她给的这种巧克力的味道。他刚闻到的巧克力香味唤起了他的某些回忆，虽然不够清晰，但强烈，让人难以平静。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Them, it appeared, meant the Party, and above all the Inner Party, about whom she talked with an open jeering hatred which made Winston feel uneasy, although he knew that they were safe here if they could be safe anywhere. A thing that astonished him about her was the coarseness of her language. Party members were supposed not to swear, and Winston himself very seldom did swear, aloud, at any rate. Julia, however, seemed unable to mention the Party, and especially the Inner Party, without using the kind of words that you saw chalked up in dripping alleyways. He did not dislike it. It was merely one symptom of her revolt against the Party and all its ways, and somehow it seemed natural and healthy, like the sneeze of a horse that smells bad hay. They had left the clearing and were wandering again through the chequered shade, with their arms round each other's waists whenever it was wide enough to walk two abreast. He noticed how much softer her waist seemed to feel now that the sash was gone. They did not speak above a whisper. Outside the clearing, Julia said, it was better to go quietly.

Winston looked out into the field beyond, and underwent a curious, slow shock of recognition. He knew it by sight. An old, close-bitten pasture, with a footpath wandering across it and a molehill here and there. In the ragged hedge on the opposite side the boughs of the elm trees swayed just perceptibly in the breeze, and their leaves stirred faintly in dense masses like women's hair.

<div class="line_en">A thrush had alighted on a bough not five metres away, almost at the level of their faces. Perhaps it had not seen them. It was in the sun, they in the shade. It spread out its wings, fitted them carefully into place again, ducked its head for a moment, as though making a sort of obeisance to the sun, and then began to pour forth a torrent of song. In the afternoon hush the volume of sound was startling. Winston and Julia clung together, fascinated. The music went on and on, minute after minute, with astonishing variations, never once repeating itself, almost as though the bird were deliberately showing off its virtuosity. Sometimes it stopped for a few seconds, spread out and resettled its wings, then swelled its speckled breast and again burst into song. Winston watched it with a sort of vague reverence. For whom, for what, was that bird singing? No mate, no rival was watching it. What made it sit at the edge of the lonely wood and pour its music into nothingness? He wondered whether after all there was a microphone hidden somewhere near. He and Julia had only spoken in low whispers, and it would not pick up what they had said, but it would pick up the thrush. Perhaps at the other end of the instrument some small, beetle-like man was listening intently -- listening to that. But by degrees the flood of music drove all speculations out of his mind. It was as though it were a kind of liquid stuff that poured all over him and got mixed up with the sunlight that filtered through the leaves. He stopped thinking and merely felt. The girl's waist in the bend of his arm was soft and warm. He pulled her round so that they were breast to breast; her body seemed to melt into his. Wherever his hands moved it was all as yielding as water. Their mouths clung together; it was quite different from the hard kisses they had exchanged earlier. When they moved their faces apart again both of them sighed deeply. The bird took fright and fled with a clatter of wings.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不到五米远，一只画眉落在一棵树枝上，几乎就在他们脸的水平线上。也许它没有看见他们。它在阳光里，而他们在树荫下。它张开翅膀，又慢慢收拢，把头低了一会儿，好像对太阳俯首行礼，随后开始放声鸣唱。在下午的寂静中，这清脆的声音非常动听。他们拥抱在一起，很陶醉。一分钟又一分钟，歌声持续不断，变化无穷，从不重复，好像这只鸟有心要展示它精湛的才艺。有时它稍停片刻，张开又收拢翅膀，接着鼓鼓有斑点的胸脯，又引吭高歌。温斯顿怀着敬意地注视着它。这只鸟为谁，为什么而唱？没有同伴，没有对手在场观看。它为何孤单地站在林边一根树枝上向着虚空放歌？他想知道附近是否藏有窃听器。他和朱丽亚只是低声细语，窃听器收不到他们说的话，但会收到画眉的歌唱。也许在窃听器的另一头，某个甲虫模样的小人正专注地听着——听到的却是鸟的声音。但渐渐地，清泉一般的歌声将他所有的思虑从脑海里驱逐出去。就好像一股激流涌过全身，汇入透过树叶的阳光中。他不再想什么，只是感受着。他怀中女孩的腰肢柔软又温暖。他将她的身子转过来，胸贴着胸；她的身体似乎融入到他的体内。他的手所到之处都像水一样柔顺。他们嘴唇紧咬；这与他们先前硬梆梆的吻大为不同。当他们再次将脸分开，两人都深深地吸了口气。那只鸟受到惊吓，拍拍翅膀飞走了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Quickly, with an occasional crackle of twigs, they threaded their way back to the clearing. When they were once inside the ring of saplings she turned and faced him. They were both breathing fast, but the smile had reappeared round the corners of her mouth. She stood looking at him for an instant, then felt at the zipper of her overalls. And, yes! it was almost as in his dream. Almost as swiftly as he had imagined it, she had torn her clothes off, and when she flung them aside it was with that same magnificent gesture by which a whole civilisation seemed to be annihilated. Her body gleamed white in the sun. But for a moment he did not look at her body; his eyes were anchored by the freckled face with its faint, bold smile. He knelt down before her and took her hands in his.</div>

<div class="line_en">His heart leapt. Scores of times she had done it: he wished it had been hundreds -- thousands. Anything that hinted at corruption always filled him with a wild hope. Who knew, perhaps the Party was rotten under the surface, its cult of strenuousness and self-denial simply a sham concealing iniquity. If he could have infected the whole lot of them with leprosy or syphilis, how gladly he would have done so! Anything to rot, to weaken, to undermine! He pulled her down so that they were kneeling face to face.</div>

<div class="line_en">That was above all what he wanted to hear. Not merely the love of one person, but the animal instinct, the simple undifferentiated desire: that was the force that would tear the Party to pieces. He pressed her down upon the grass, among the fallen bluebells. This time there was no difficulty. Presently the rising and falling of their breasts slowed to normal speed, and in a sort of pleasant helplessness they fell apart. The sun seemed to have grown hotter. They were both sleepy. He reached out for the discarded overalls and pulled them partly over her. Almost immediately they fell asleep and slept for about half an hour.</div>

<div class="line_en">Winston woke first. He sat up and watched the freckled face, still peacefully asleep, pillowed on the palm of her hand. Except for her mouth, you could not call her beautiful. There was a line or two round the eyes, if you looked closely. The short dark hair was extraordinarily thick and soft. It occurred to him that he still did not know her surname or where she lived.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="温斯顿先醒来。他坐起身，看着那张长满雀斑的脸，她仍安详地睡着，头枕在她的手掌上。除了她的嘴，女孩说不上漂亮。如果你仔细看，可以发现她眼睛旁有一两条皱纹。短短的黑发非常浓密柔软。他想到他仍然不知道她姓什么和住哪里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The young, strong body, now helpless in sleep, awoke in him a pitying, protecting feeling. But the mindless tenderness that he had felt under the hazel tree, while the thrush was singing, had not quite come back. He pulled the overalls aside and studied her smooth white flank. In the old days, he thought, a man looked at a girl's body and saw that it was desirable, and that was the end of the story. But you could not have pure love or pure lust nowadays. No emotion was pure, because everything was mixed up with fear and hatred. Their embrace had been a battle, the climax a victory. It was a blow struck against the Party. It was a political act.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这个年轻、结实的身体此刻在睡梦中显得无助，这在他心里唤起了怜爱呵护之情。但这不完全是他在榛子树下，听着画眉的歌声时感到的那种无所用心的柔情。他把衣服掀开，察看她光滑白皙的腹部。在过去，他想，一个男人看一个女孩的身体，就会产生欲念，这也就是故事的结尾了，而如今，人们已经没有了纯粹的爱或纯粹的肉欲。激情也不纯粹了，因为每件事情都掺杂着恐惧和愤恨。他们的拥抱是一场战斗，高潮就是胜利。这是对党的一次沉重打击。这是一个政治行为。">查看中文翻译</div>
