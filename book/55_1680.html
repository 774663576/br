<div class="line_en">Other than the drop in numbers, the most striking feature of the decline in European homicide is the change in the socioeconomic profile of killing. Centuries ago rich people were as violent as poor people, if not more so. Gentlemen would carry swords and would not hesitate to use them to avenge insults. They often traveled with retainers who doubled as bodyguards, so an affront or a retaliation for an affront could escalate into a bloody street fight between gangs of aristocrats (as in the opening scene of Romeo and Juliet). The economist Gregory Clark examined records of deaths of English aristocrats from late medieval times to the Industrial Revolution. I've plotted his data in figure 3-7, which shows that in the 14th and 15th centuries an astonishing 26 percent of male aristocrats died from violence -- about the same rate that we saw in figure 2-2 as the average for preliterate tribes. The rate fell into the single digits by the turn of the 18th century, and of course today it is essentially zero.</div>

Boswell quotes Samuel Johnson, who presumably had no trouble defending himself with words, as saying, "I have beat many a fellow, but the rest had the wit to hold their tongues." Members of the upper classes eventually refrained from using force against one another, but with the law watching their backs, they reserved the right to use it against their inferiors.

<div class="line_en">The European decline of violence was spearheaded by a decline in elite violence. Today statistics from every Western country show that the overwhelming majority of homicides and other violent crimes are committed by people in the lowest socioeconomic classes. One obvious reason for the shift is that in medieval times, one achieved high status through the use of force. The journalist Steven Sailer recounts an exchange from early-20th-century England: "A hereditary member of the British House of Lords complained that Prime Minister Lloyd George had created new Lords solely because they were self-made millionaires who had only recently acquired large acreages. When asked, 'How did your ancestor become a Lord?' he replied sternly, 'With the battle-ax, sir, with the battle-ax!'"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="精英阶层是欧洲暴力下降中的急先锋。今天欧洲各国的统计都显示，绝大部分的凶杀和其他暴力犯罪的罪犯来自于最低的社会经济阶层。这一变化的原因显然是因为在中世纪，人们可以通过武力实现晋升。记者史蒂文·赛勒（Steven Sailer）这样回顾了20世纪初期英国发生的变化：“英国上院的一位世袭议员抱怨首相劳合·乔治设立了一些新爵位，仅仅因为这些人自己打拼成了百万富翁，刚刚置办了大片的地产。当问这位议员‘您祖上又是怎样得到爵位的？’时，他厉声回答说：‘全靠战斧，先生，全靠战斧！’。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As the upper classes were putting down their battle-axes, disarming their retinues, and no longer punching out bargees and cabmen, the middle classes followed suit. They were domesticated not by the royal court, of course, but by other civilizing forces. Employment in factories and businesses forced employees to acquire habits of decorum. An increasingly democratic political process allowed them to identify with the institutions of government and society, and it opened up the court system as a way to pursue their grievances. And then came an institution that was introduced in London in 1828 by Sir Robert Peel and soon named after him, the municipal police, or bobbies.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="上流社会终于放下战斧，遣散了卫队，不再挥拳暴打仆从和车夫，中产阶级则追随其后。这一次不是依靠宫廷，而是有其他的文明力量完成了这一驯化。在工厂和商业机构就业的人必须要学习恪守礼仪。日渐发展的民主政治让人民开始认同政府和社会机构，并接受由法庭来裁处他们的冤屈。接着，1828年，罗伯特·皮尔（Robert Peel）爵士在伦敦创立了一个新组织，市警察局，并以他自己的小名命名了这一机构——“鲍比”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In an influential article called "Crime as Social Control," the legal scholar Donald Black argued that most of what we call crime is, from the point of view of the perpetrator, the pursuit of justice. Black began with a statistic that has long been known to criminologists: only a minority of homicides (perhaps as few as 10 percent) are committed as a means to a practical end, such as killing a homeowner during a burglary, a policeman during an arrest, or the victim of a robbery or rape because dead people tell no tales. The most common motives for homicide are moralistic: retaliation after an insult, escalation of a domestic quarrel, punishing an unfaithful or deserting romantic partner, and other acts of jealousy, revenge, and self-defense. Black cites some cases from a database in Houston:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="《作为社会控制的犯罪》（Crime as Social Control）是一篇颇具影响的论文，作者法学家唐纳德·布莱克（Donald Black）在文章中说，我们所说的犯罪，从犯罪者的角度看，则是寻求公正。犯罪学家们对布莱克所使用的统计数据早有所知，即凶杀中，只有很小的比例（大约在10%）有明确的犯罪目的，比如，盗窃时杀害屋主，逮捕行动中杀害警察，或在抢劫和强奸之后杀死受害人灭口。此外的大部分凶杀案的最常见动机都与道德有关，比如受到侮辱后的回击，家务争端恶化，处罚情侣的出轨或背弃，以及其他嫉妒、报复和自卫之类的行动。布莱克列举了一些休斯敦资料库中的案例：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The main reason that violence correlates with low socioeconomic status today is that the elites and the middle class pursue justice with the legal system while the lower classes resort to what scholars of violence call "self-help." This has nothing to do with Women Who Love Too Much or Chicken Soup for the Soul; it is another name for vigilantism, frontier justice, taking the law into your own hands, and other forms of violent retaliation by which people secured justice in the absence of intervention by the state.</div>

<div class="line_en">Most homicides, Black notes, are really instances of capital punishment, with a private citizen as the judge, jury, and executioner. It's a reminder that the way we conceive of a violent act depends on which of the corners of the violence triangle (see figure 2-1) we stake out as our vantage point. Consider a man who is arrested and tried for wounding his wife's lover. From the point of view of the law, the aggressor is the husband and the victim is society, which is now pursuing justice (an interpretation, recall, captured in the naming of court cases, such as The People vs. John Doe). From the point of view of the lover, the aggressor is the husband, and he is the victim; if the husband gets off on an acquittal or mistrial or plea bargain, there is no justice, as the lover is enjoined from pursuing revenge. And from the point of view of the husband, he is the victim (of cuckoldry), the lover is the aggressor, and justice has been done -- but now he is the victim of a second act of aggression, in which the state is the aggressor and the lover is an accomplice. Black notes:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="布莱克注意到，大部分的凶杀都是死刑案，法官、陪审员和刽子手都是普通公民。这提醒我们，我们怎样看待暴力，取决于在暴力三角（见图2—1）中我们怎样占据制高点。设想一下，一个男子因为伤害他的妻子的情人而被捕受审。从法律的立场看，丈夫是侵犯者，社会是受害人，社会因此要寻求公正（法庭为案件命名的方式，恰恰体现了这一性质，比如人民控告约翰·某某）。从情人的立场来看，侵犯者是丈夫，他自己是受害人。如果这个丈夫被判无罪或流审，或者达成认罪减刑，对于寻求复仇的情人来说，都是不公正的。从丈夫的立场看，他是（通奸的）受害者，情人是侵犯者，正义已经得到伸张——但是现在，他却成了二次侵犯的受害人，国家成了侵犯者，情人是从犯。布莱克注意到：">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">These observations overturn many dogmas about violence. One is that violence is caused by a deficit of morality and justice. On the contrary, violence is often caused by a surfeit of morality and justice, at least as they are conceived in the minds of the perpetrators. Another dogma, cherished among psychologists and public health researchers, is that violence is a kind of disease. But this public health theory of violence flouts the basic definition of a disease, namely a malfunction that causes suffering to the individual. Most violent people insist there is nothing wrong with them; it's the victim and bystanders who think there's a problem. A third dubious belief about violence is that lower-class people engage in it because they are financially needy (for example, stealing food to feed their children) or because they are expressing rage against society. The violence of a lower-class man may indeed express rage, but it is aimed not at society but at the asshole who scraped his car and dissed him in front of a crowd.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这些观察颠覆了许多有关暴力的教条。其中之一是暴力是由道德和公正的缺失造成的。相反，过量的道德和正义经常引发暴力，至少犯罪人认为自己是站在道德和正义一方的。另一个备受心理学家和公共卫生研究者珍视的教条是，暴力是一种疾病。但是，公共卫生学对暴力的解释完全无视疾病的基本定义，即某种引起个人不适的障碍。最凶残的罪犯也坚持认为自己绝无疾患，反而是受害人和旁观者认为暴力是一种疾病。第三个似是而非的信条是，下层人民卷入暴力是因为经济窘困，比如，为喂养孩子而偷窃食物，或者他们要表达对社会的愤怒。下层的暴力也许真有表达愤怒的意思，但对象不是社会，而是剐蹭了他的汽车、在大庭广众之下羞辱了他的那个浑蛋。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But another reason for their statelessness is that lower-status people and the legal system often live in a condition of mutual hostility. Black and Cooney report that in dealing with low-income African Americans, police "seem to vacillate between indifference and hostility,… reluctant to become involved in their affairs but heavy handed when they do so." Judges and prosecutors too "tend to be… uninterested in the disputes of low-status people, typically disposing of them quickly and, to the parties involved, with an unsatisfactory penal emphasis."

<div class="line_en">In an article inspired by Black called "The Decline of Elite Homicide," the criminologist Mark Cooney shows that many lower-status people -- the poor, the uneducated, the unmarried, and members of minority groups -- are effectively stateless. Some make a living from illegal activities like drug dealing, gambling, selling stolen goods, and prostitution, so they cannot file lawsuits or call the police to enforce their interests in business disputes. In that regard they share their need for recourse to violence with certain high-status people, namely dealers in contraband such as Mafiosi, drug kingpins, and Prohibition rumrunners.</div>
