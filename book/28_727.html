<div class="line_en">I dressed up for our New York date, putting on a black cocktail dress and lipstick, styling my hair in an elegant updo. I felt a fluttering excitement at the prospect of a getaway, of time alone with my husband. In the last few months, we'd hosted dinners and gone to Kennedy Center performances together, but it was almost always in an official capacity and with lots of other people. This was to be a true night off.</div>

<div class="line_en">One Saturday evening at the end of May, Barack took me out on a date. In the four months since becoming president, he'd been spending his days working on ways to fulfill the various promises made to voters during the campaign; now he was making good on a promise to me. We were going to New York, to have dinner and see a show.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="5月末，一个星期六的晚上，贝拉克决定要带我出去，实现我们二人的单独约会。当选总统的四个月以来，贝拉克每天都在马不停蹄地工作，以兑现他竞选时对选民做出的各项承诺，当然，他同样是在兑现给我的承诺。我们要去趟纽约，一起吃饭，一起看演出。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For years in Chicago, our date nights had been a sacred part of every week, an indulgence we built into our lives and protected no matter what. I love talking to my husband across a small table in a low-lit room. I always have, and I expect I always will. Barack is a good listener, patient and thoughtful. I love how he tips his head back when he laughs. I love the lightness in his eyes, the kindness at his core. Having a drink and an unrushed meal together has always been our pathway back to the start, to that first hot summer when everything between us carried an electric charge.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在芝加哥的那些年，我和贝拉克每周都会单独约会，而且这已经成了我们日常生活中非常神圣的一部分，也算是我们对自己的一点儿小小的放纵。不论什么情况下，我们都尽力维护每周的例行约会，确保其不被其他任何事情影响。我喜欢在昏暗的灯光下，跟贝拉克面对面坐在一张小桌前谈天说地。我们从前一直如此，我希望以后也同样如此。贝拉克是一个很好的倾听者，他不但有耐心，而且很体贴。我非常喜欢看他笑起来头向后仰的样子，喜欢他明亮的眼神、善良的本性。喝上一点儿酒，从容地吃一顿饭，我们好像又回到了当初，回到了我们初次相遇的那个夏天。那时候，我们俩总能擦出火花。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Barack had dressed in a dark suit with no tie. We kissed the girls and my mom good-bye in the late afternoon and walked hand in hand across the South Lawn and climbed onto Marine One, the presidential helicopter, which took us to Andrews Air Force Base. We next boarded a small Air Force plane, flew to JFK Airport, and were then helicoptered into Manhattan. Our movements had been planned meticulously in advance by our scheduling teams and the Secret Service, meant as always to maximize efficiency and security.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="贝拉克穿了一套黑色的西装，但是没有打领带。下午晚些时候，我们跟两个孩子和我母亲道别后，手挽手穿过南草坪，登上总统专用的“海军陆战队一号”直升机，前往安德鲁斯空军基地。在那儿，我们将换乘一架小型空军飞机，飞往纽约的约翰·菲茨杰拉德·肯尼迪国际机场，接着飞往曼哈顿。我们的出行路线都是经过日程安排团队及特工处事先周密筹划的，他们考虑问题时从来都是要将效率和安全这两个因素极致化。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Barack (with the help of Sam Kass) had chosen a restaurant near Washington Square Park that he knew I'd love for its emphasis on locally grown foods, a small, tucked-away eatery called Blue Hill. As we motorcaded the last stretch of the journey from the helipad in lower Manhattan to Greenwich Village, I noted the lights of the cop cars being used to barricade the cross streets, feeling a twinge of guilt at how our mere presence in the city was mucking up the Saturday evening flow. New York always awakened a sense of awe in me, big and busy enough to dwarf anyone's ego. I remembered how wide-eyed I'd been on my first trip there decades earlier with Czerny, my mentor from Princeton. Barack, I knew, felt something even deeper. The wild energy and diversity of the city had proven the perfect hatching place for his intellect and imagination years back when he was a student at Columbia.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在萨姆·卡斯的帮助下，贝拉克为我们挑选了纽约华盛顿广场公园附近的一家餐厅。那家餐厅名叫“蓝山”，面积很小，位置也比较隐蔽，主推当地生产的食物。贝拉克知道，就冲这一点我就一定会喜欢。当我们的车队从曼哈顿直升机停机坪驶向格林尼治村（这是我们此次旅途的最后一段路程）时，前面警车灯光闪烁，我知道，那些警车是专门用来封锁前方的十字路口的，好让我们顺利通过。我顿时感到一阵内疚，正是因为我们的出现，才让这个城市星期六夜晚的交通变得拥堵。说起纽约城，它总会让我产生一种敬畏感，它是那么庞大，那么忙碌，足以让任何人在它面前显得渺小。我还清楚记得很多年前，当我和泽妮第一次来到这里时，我全程被惊得目瞪口呆的情景。我相信，贝拉克的体会一定比我更深刻。很多年前，当他在哥伦比亚大学就读的时候，正是纽约城那强大的能量以及多元的包容性，造就了他今日的智慧以及想象力。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At the restaurant, we were shown to a table in a discreet corner of the room as around us people tried not to gawk. But there was no hiding our arrival. Anyone who came in after we did would have to get swept with a magnetometer wand by a Secret Service team, a process that was usually quick but still an inconvenience. For this, I felt another twinge.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们到达餐厅后，服务员将我们带到一个不起眼的角落里，这样就不会引起太多人的注意。但是，我们的行程不可能完全保密。随后，只要是在我们之后到来的客人，都要接受安全检查，由特工处特工用手持安检仪进行全身扫描，虽说这样的检查并不费时，但仍然造成了很多不便。这一点也让我觉得非常抱歉。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We ordered martinis. Our conversation stayed light. Four months into our lives as POTUS and FLOTUS, we were still retrofitting -- figuring out how one identity worked with the other and what this meant inside our marriage. These days, there was almost no part of Barack's complicated life that didn't in some way impact mine, which meant there was plenty of shared business we could have discussed -- his team's decision to schedule a foreign trip during the girls' summer vacation, for example, or whether my chief of staff was being listened to at morning staff meetings in the West Wing -- but I tried in general to avoid it, not just this night, but every night. If I had an issue with something going on in the West Wing, I usually relied on my staff to convey it to Barack's, doing what I could to keep White House business out of our personal time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们点了马天尼酒，聊的内容也很轻松。在我们分别担任美国总统和美国第一夫人的几个月里，我们俩都在逐渐适应—学习在两种身份之间不停切换，以及如何平衡工作与婚姻的关系。这些天里，贝拉克的生活骤然变得复杂，当然，他遇到的任何一件事情我也没能幸免。也就是说，我们是有足够多的共同话题可以分享的—比如，在两个孩子放暑假期间，他的团队决定安排一次国外旅行；又比如，在白宫西翼召开的员工晨会上，我的办公室主任的发言有没有被采纳—但是，我都尽量避免提到这些话题，不单今晚如此，每天晚上都如此。日常工作中，如果我遇到一些跟白宫西翼有关的事务，我通常都让我的员工去跟贝拉克的员工沟通协调，而不是自己直接出面。总之，我一直尽量避免将白宫的公务带入我的个人生活当中。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Sometimes Barack wanted to talk about work, though more often than not he avoided it. So much of his job was just plain grueling, the challenges huge and often seemingly intractable. General Motors was days away from filing for bankruptcy. North Korea had just conducted a nuclear test, and Barack was soon to leave for Egypt to deliver a major address meant to extend an open hand to Muslims around the world. The ground around him never seemed to stop shaking. Anytime old friends came to visit us at the White House, they were amused by the intensity with which both Barack and I quizzed them about their jobs, their kids, their hobbies, anything. The two of us were always less interested in talking about the intricacies of our new existence and more interested in sponging up bits of gossip and everyday news from home. Both of us, it seemed, craved glimpses of regular life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="虽然大多数情况下贝拉克也会尽量避免将工作带到生活中，但是有时候，他还是忍不住想与我探讨。他的工作都太熬人，他面对的挑战实在太大了，而且通常都非常棘手。通用汽车将在数天以后申请破产保护；朝鲜刚刚进行了一场核试验；贝拉克很快就要出访埃及，并将发表一场重要演说，以向伊斯兰世界伸出橄榄枝。他脚下的每一寸土地似乎从来没有停止过震动。每次有老朋友来白宫拜访我们，我和贝拉克都会问他们很多关于工作、孩子以及个人爱好的问题，他们经常会被逗乐。我们俩都不太愿意谈论我们的新角色以及新角色带来的种种复杂状况，相反，我们更愿意听一些八卦以及家庭生活的趣闻。由此可以看出，我们俩对普通人的日常生活是多么的渴望。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That evening in New York, we ate, drank, and conversed in the candlelight, reveling in the feeling, however illusory, that we'd stolen away. The White House is a remarkably beautiful and comfortable place, a kind of fortress disguised as a home, and from the point of view of the Secret Service agents tasked with protecting us, it would probably be ideal if we never left its grounds. Even inside it, the agents seemed happiest if we took the elevator instead of the stairs, to minimize the risk of a stumble. If Barack or I had a meeting in Blair House, located just across an already closed-off part of Pennsylvania Avenue, they'd sometimes request that we take the motorcade instead of walking in the fresh air. We respected the watchfulness, but it could feel like a form of confinement. I struggled sometimes, trying to balance my needs with what was convenient for others. If anyone in our family wanted to step outside onto the Truman Balcony -- the lovely arcing terrace that overlooked the South Lawn, and the only semiprivate outdoor space we had at the White House -- we needed to first alert the Secret Service so that they could shut down the section of E Street that was in view of the balcony, clearing out the flocks of tourists who gathered outside the gates there at all hours of the day and night. There were many times when I thought I'd go out to sit on the balcony, but then reconsidered, realizing the hassle I would cause, the vacations I'd be interrupting, all because I thought it would be nice to have a cup of tea outdoors.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天晚上，我们俩在纽约吃吃喝喝，在昏黄的烛光中谈天说地。我们甚至一度产生错觉，以为我们终于逃离一切，并陶醉在这种感觉中，尽管它是如此虚幻。白宫确实是一个非常漂亮、舒适的地方，但它更像是一个堡垒，只不过伪装成了一个家的样子。由于特工处的特工承担着保护我们安全的重任，因此对于他们来说，如果我们能永远不离开白宫的地界，那将是最理想的状态。即使在白宫里面，如果我们选择乘坐电梯而不走楼梯，特工们也会放心很多，因为这样就能将我们失足绊倒的风险降到最低。如果贝拉克或者我要到布莱尔大厦参加会议，尽管大厦就坐落在宾夕法尼亚大道对面，并且那里已经对外关闭，他们有时仍希望我们能乘车前去，而不是呼吸着新鲜的空气走过去。我们很尊重他们的这种职业警觉性，但也会因此觉得这种生活就像是监禁。如果我们家任何人想到杜鲁门阳台（一个可以俯瞰白宫南草坪的弧形露台，也是我们在白宫里唯一一个半私用的户外场所）去一趟，我们必须事先告诉特工处，然后他们会提前关闭E街区上能够看到阳台的那部分，清除聚集在铁栅栏外观赏白宫的所有游客，因为不论是白天还是黑夜，那里二十四小时都可能会有游客聚集。正因为如此，有时候我会表示反抗，希望能够在我的需求和别人的方便之间取得平衡。有很多次，我本想出去到阳台上坐一坐，但后来重新考虑后又都放弃了，因为我意识到，虽然只是在那里喝一杯茶，算不上什么大事，却会给特工处带来很多麻烦，也会打搅到很多人的假期。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">With our movements so controlled, the number of steps Barack and I took in a day had plummeted. As a result, both of us had grown fiercely dependent on the small gym on the top floor of the residence. Barack ran on the treadmill about an hour every day, trying to beat back his physical restlessness. I was working out every morning as well, often with Cornell, who'd been our trainer in Chicago and now lived part-time in Washington on our behalf, coming over at least a few times a week to push us with plyometrics and weights.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正是因为我们的自由行动严重受限，我和贝拉克每天走路的步数大大减少，所以，我们俩越来越依赖住所顶层的那个小健身房。贝拉克每天都会在跑步机上跑一小时，释放他的运动渴望。我也每天早上和康奈尔一起去锻炼。康奈尔是我们在芝加哥时候的健身教练，现在因为我们的缘故也在华盛顿兼职，每周会来白宫几次带着我们做增强肌肉的训练和力量训练。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Setting aside the business of the country, Barack and I never lacked for things to discuss. We talked that night over dinner about Malia's flute lessons; Sasha's ongoing devotion to her perilously frayed Blankie, which she kept draped over her head as she slept at night. When I told a funny story about how a makeup artist recently tried and failed to put false eyelashes on my mom before a photo shoot, Barack tipped his head and laughed, exactly the way I knew he would. And we had a new and entertaining baby in the house to talk about as well -- a seven-month-old, completely rambunctious Portuguese water dog we'd named Bo, a gift to our family from Senator Ted Kennedy and a fulfillment of the promise we'd made to the girls during the campaign. The girls had taken to playing a hide-and-seek game with him on the South Lawn, crouching behind trees and shouting his name as he scampered across the open grass, following their voices. All of us loved Bo.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="抛开公务不谈，我和贝拉克之间也从来不缺话题。那天晚上我们一边吃饭，一边聊到了玛利亚的长笛课，还有萨沙的小毯子，那个小毯子快要磨坏了，但萨沙对它还是一如既往地不舍，每天晚上睡觉的时候，都要把它盖在头上。我还给贝拉克讲了一件那时发生的非常有趣的事，大概就是在某一次拍照的时候，一名化妆师想要给我母亲贴上假睫毛，但最终失败了。贝拉克被逗得直笑，他一边笑一边头向后仰，和我想象中一模一样。最近，我们还多了一个可以谈论的非常有趣的新对象，它是一只七个月大、精力非常充沛的葡萄牙水犬，我们给它取名叫“阿博”，是参议员特德·肯尼迪送给我们一家人的礼物，也是我们当初竞选时给两个女儿许下的承诺，最后总算是兑现了。两个孩子经常带着阿博在南草坪玩躲猫猫游戏，当阿博在草坪上又跑又跳地玩耍时，她们俩赶紧偷偷躲到大树后面，然后大声喊阿博的名字，让它顺着她们的声音去寻找。我们一家人都非常喜欢这只水犬。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">We were a nuisance, Barack and I, a disruption to any normal scene. There was no getting around that fact. We felt it acutely as our motorcade zipped us up Sixth Avenue and over toward Times Square, where hours earlier police had cordoned off an entire block in front of the theater, where our fellow theatergoers were now waiting in line to pass through metal detectors that normally weren't there and the performers would need to wait an extra forty-five minutes to start the show due to the security checks.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="毕竟，我和贝拉克都是令人讨厌的人，我们所到之处，任何正常秩序都会被打乱，这是一个无法回避的事实。当我们的车队护着我们驶入第六大道前往时代广场的时候，我们就非常真切地体会到了这一点。在我们到达数小时之前，警察已经封锁了百老汇剧院前的整个街区，所有前来看戏的人都要先排队等候，通过安检仪的扫描才能进入，当晚的演出也因为安检原因不得不推迟四十五分钟开演，要在平常，肯定不会出现这些状况。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When we finally finished our meal and stood up to leave, the diners around us rose to their feet and applauded, which struck me as both kind and unnecessary. It's possible that some of them were glad to see us go.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在我们吃完晚饭起身要离开的时候，我们周围的食客纷纷站起来鼓掌，这让我多少有些惊讶，我知道他们都是在表达善意，但同时也觉得确实没有必要。不过，他们当中可能也有人希望我们赶快离开。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The play, when it finally began, was marvelous -- a drama by August Wilson set inside a Pittsburgh boardinghouse during the Great Migration, when millions of African Americans left the South and flooded into the Midwest, just as my relatives on both sides had done. Sitting in the dark next to Barack, I was riveted, a little emotional, and for a short while able to get lost in the performance and the sense of quiet contentment that came with just being off duty and out in the world.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最终，演出终于开始了。这场演出真的是棒极了，是奥古斯特·威尔逊 [1]创作的一出戏剧，讲述了大移民时期，匹兹堡的一间寄宿公寓里发生的故事，就如我父亲和母亲两边的亲戚当年所经历的那样。当时数以百万计的非洲裔美国人离开南方乡村，迁移至中西部的工业城市。观看演出的时候，我在黑暗中紧紧挨着贝拉克坐着，有点痴迷，有点感动，有那么一阵子，我似乎完全沉醉在演出以及逃离众人视线、逃离工作所带来的那种安静的满足之中。【注：[1]奥古斯特·威尔逊（August Wilson，1945—2005），他是20世纪末美国最为成功的黑人剧作家。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As we flew back to Washington late that night, I already knew it would be a long time before we did anything like this again. Barack's political opponents would criticize him for taking me to New York to see a show. The Republican Party would put out a press release before we'd even gotten home, saying that our date had been extravagant and costly to taxpayers, a message that would get picked up and debated on cable news. Barack's team would quietly reinforce the point, urging us to be more mindful of the politics, making me feel guilty and selfish for having stolen a rare moment out and alone with my husband.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那晚晚些时候，当我们启程返回华盛顿时，我就知道，我和贝拉克下一次这样的约会恐怕又要等到很久以后了。贝拉克的政敌一定会借此尽情发挥，指责他带我去纽约看演出是浪费纳税人的钱用于个人享受，甚至在我们还没有回到家的时候，共和党已经召开新闻发布会，称我们此次约会极度奢侈浪费。这一信息也会被新闻媒体捕捉到，并引发热烈讨论。贝拉克的幕僚虽然没有发表意见，但他们用沉默表达了他们的立场—贝拉克和我都应该对政治更敏感、更上心一些，这让我感到更加内疚，觉得自己不应该这样自私，只顾着忙里偷闲与自己的丈夫单独外出约会，而不考虑由此造成的后果。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was as if with our date Barack and I had tested a theory and proven both the best and the worst parts of what we'd suspected all along. The nice part was that we could step away for a romantic evening the way we used to, years earlier, before his political life took over. We could, as First Couple, feel close and connected, enjoying a meal and a show in a city we both loved. The harder part was seeing the selfishness inherent in making that choice, knowing that it had required hours of advance meetings between security teams and local police. It had involved extra work for our staffers, for the theater, for the waiters at the restaurant, for the people whose cars had been diverted off Sixth Avenue, for the police on the street. It was part of the new heaviness we lived with. There were just too many people involved, too many affected, for anything to feel light.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="不过，也正是借着这次单独约会，我和贝拉克共同证实了一种推测，并证实了我们一直以来所猜测的最好的部分和最坏的部分。好的那部分是，即使我们现在生活在白宫中，我们其实也可以外出去度过一个属于我们二人的浪漫之夜，就像很多年前，贝拉克的政治生涯还未开始时那样；即使作为第一夫妇，我们也可以照常亲密，照常相爱，在一座我们共同喜欢的城市里，一起享用一顿晚餐、观看一场演出。不好的那部分是，我们做出这样的选择，也暴露了我们内心的自私，因为我们早就清楚，这样做会带来很多麻烦，比如，特工处需要事先与当地警察局专门召开数小时的协调会议，同时，还会给很多人增加额外的工作量，比如剧院的工作人员、餐厅的服务员、因交通管制而不得不开车绕行西侧高速公路的司机，以及在街道上执勤的警察。而这一切，正是我们当时生活中的不可承受之重。我们没办法觉得轻松，因为会涉及那么多人，影响那么多人。">查看中文翻译</div>

For me, it was a gratifying sight -- a miniature Eden in progress, made up of spiraling young tendrils and half-grown shoots, carrot and onion stalks just beginning to rise, the patches of spinach dense and green, with bright red and yellow flowers blooming around the edges. We were growing food.</div>

<div class="line_en">Regardless of what I chose to do, I knew I was bound to disappoint someone. The campaign had taught me that my every move and facial expression would be read a dozen different ways. I was either hard-driving and angry or, with my garden and messages about healthy eating, I was a disappointment to feminists, lacking a certain stridency. Several months before Barack was elected, I'd told a magazine interviewer that my primary focus in the White House would be to continue my role as "mom in chief" in our family. I'd said it casually, but the phrase caught hold and was amplified across the press. Some Americans seemed to embrace it, understanding all too well the amount of organization and drive it takes to raise children. Others, meanwhile, seemed vaguely appalled, presuming it to mean that as First Lady I'd do nothing but pipe-cleaner craft projects with my kids.</div>

<div class="line_en">The problem was woven into every aspect of family life, from the high price of fresh fruits to widespread cuts in funding for sports and rec programs in public schools. TV, computers, and video games competed for kids' time, and in some neighborhoods staying indoors felt like a safer choice than going outside to play, as Craig and I had done when we were kids. Many families in underserved sections of big cities didn't have grocery stores in their neighborhoods. Rural shoppers across large swaths of the country were similarly out of luck when it came to accessing fresh produce. Meanwhile, portion sizes at restaurants were increasing. Advertising slogans for sugary cereal, microwavable convenience foods, and supersized everything were downloaded directly into the minds of children watching cartoons.</div>

If I were to try to declare war on sugary drinks marketed to kids, it would likely be opposed not just by the big beverage companies but also by farmers who supplied the corn used in many sweeteners. If I were to advocate for healthier school lunches, I'd put myself on a collision course with the big corporate lobbies that often dictated what food ended up on a fourth grader's tray at the cafeteria. For years, public health experts and advocates had been outmatched by the better-organized, better-funded food and beverage industrial complex.

We went to Monticello and Mount Vernon and explored caves in the Shenandoah Valley. We visited the Bureau of Engraving and Printing to see how dollars got made and toured Frederick Douglass's house in the southeast part of Washington, learning how an enslaved person could become a scholar and a hero.

I was supposed to stand out without overshadowing others, to blend in but not fade away.

I'd match a high-end Michael Kors skirt with a T-shirt from Gap. I wore something from Target one day and Diane von Furstenberg the next. I wanted to draw attention to and celebrate American designers, most especially those who were less established, even if it sometimes frustrated old-guard designers, including Oscar de la Renta, who was reportedly displeased that I wasn't wearing his creations.

It required time, thought, and money -- more money than I'd spent on clothing ever before. It also required careful research by Meredith, particularly on foreign trips. She'd often spend hours making sure the designers, colors, and styles we chose paid proper respect to the people and countries we visited. Meredith also shopped for Sasha and Malia ahead of public events, which added to the overall expense, but they, too, had the gaze upon them. I sighed sometimes, watching Barack pull the same dark suit out of his closet and head off to work without even needing a comb. His biggest fashion consideration for a public moment was whether to have his suit jacket on or off. Tie or no tie?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在政界，外在形象或多或少地影响着一些事情。因此，我在每套服装的选择上，都会考虑这一因素。这不仅费时、费脑，也非常费钱，我在白宫购买衣服的花销已经超过了之前多年买衣服的总花销。当然，还需要梅雷迪思提前做大量而又细致的研究工作，尤其当我需要陪同贝拉克到国外出访的时候，她经常需要花上数小时进行研究，以确保我们所选择的服装设计师、服装的色彩、风格都要体现出对出访国及其人民应有的尊重。在举办公共活动之前，梅雷迪思还要为萨沙和玛利亚购买合适的服装，因为她们也是备受关注的公众人物了，这使得我们的服装花费进一步增加。有时候，看着贝拉克总是从衣橱拿出同一套深色套装穿上，甚至头也不梳就去上班，我只能叹气。对他来说，出席公共活动时所需要考虑的时尚就是到底要不要穿上西服外套，要不要打领带。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We were careful, Meredith and I, to always be prepared. In my dressing room, I'd put on a new dress and then squat, lunge, and pinwheel my arms, just to be sure I could move. Anything too restrictive, I put back on the rack. When I traveled, I brought backup outfits, anticipating shifts in weather and schedule, not to mention nightmare scenarios involving spilled wine or broken zippers. I learned, too, that it was important to always, no matter what, pack a dress suitable for a funeral, because Barack sometimes got called with little notice to be there as soldiers, senators, and world leaders were laid to rest.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是，对于我和梅雷迪思来说，我们永远都得小心翼翼地提前做好准备，每一件衣服我都会提前在更衣室里试穿。比如，当我试穿一件新裙子的时候，我会试着向下蹲、向前迈腿，再甩甩胳膊，确保我能够行动自如。只要是穿起来感觉有点行动不便的衣服，我都重新放回衣架上。外出的时候，我都会带上几套备用服装，以防天气变化或者行程安排有变，当然，还要考虑到诸如酒水洒在身上、拉链坏了这些噩梦般的紧急状况的出现。当然，我还学会了一招，就是无论何时，都会准备好一件适合参加葬礼的服装，因为有时候，贝拉克会毫无征兆地被邀请参加某位士兵、某位议员，以及一些世界级领导人的告别仪式。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I came to depend heavily on Meredith but also equally on Johnny Wright, my fast-talking, hard-laughing hurricane of a hairdresser, and Carl Ray, my soft-spoken and meticulous makeup artist. Together, the three of them (dubbed by my larger team "the trifecta") gave me the confidence I needed to step out in public each day, all of us knowing that a slipup would lead to a flurry of ridicule and nasty comments. I never expected to be someone who hired others to maintain my image, and at first the idea was discomfiting. But I quickly found out a truth that no one talks about: Today, virtually every woman in public life -- politicians, celebrities, you name it -- has some version of Meredith, Johnny, and Carl. It's all but a requirement, a built-in fee for our societal double standard.</div>

<div class="line_en">I did, in September, have a pleasant overdue lunch with Hillary Clinton, the two of us sitting in the residence dining room. After his election and a little to my surprise, Barack had chosen Hillary as his secretary of state, both of them managing to set aside the battle wounds of the primary campaign and build a productive working relationship. She was candid with me about how she'd misjudged the country's readiness to have a proactive professional woman in the role of First Lady. As First Lady of Arkansas, Hillary had kept her job as a law partner while also helping with her husband's efforts to improve health care and education. Arriving in Washington with the same sort of desire and energy to contribute, though, she'd been roundly spurned, pilloried for taking on a policy role in the White House's work on health-care reform. The message had been delivered with a resounding, brutal frankness: Voters had elected her husband and not her. First Ladies had no place in the West Wing. She'd tried to do too much too quickly, it seemed, and had run straight into a wall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="9月的时候，我终于兑现了跟希拉里·克林顿之前的约定，我们一起在白宫餐厅非常愉快地吃了一顿午饭。贝拉克竞选成功后，让我有一点儿惊讶的是，他选择了希拉里·克林顿出任他的国务卿。他们二人都选择将此前竞选所造成的种种创伤抛到一边，尽力建立一种富有成效的工作关系。希拉里非常坦诚地跟我说，她当初以为，整个美国已经做好准备去接纳一位积极的职业女性来做这个国家的第一夫人，但后来发现，事实并非如此。当年，希拉里还是阿肯色州的第一夫人的时候，她在保留律师事务所合伙人身份的同时，也积极帮助她的丈夫克林顿推动卫生保健及教育工作。来到华盛顿，住进白宫成为第一夫人之后，她试图开创全新的第一夫人形象，带着同样的理想和激情一如既往地为这个国家奉献。然而，她却因为参与白宫医疗改革及政策制定而招致大量批评与嘲讽，外界的反应所传达的信息非常明确而且残酷：选民们投票选出的总统是她的丈夫，而不是她本人。实际上，在美国，第一夫人是没有明确的政治地位的，而希拉里又参与太多、涉足太快，所以，她自然就碰壁了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I myself tried to be mindful of that wall, learning from other First Ladies' experience, taking care not to directly or overtly insert myself into West Wing business. I relied instead on my staff to communicate daily with Barack's, exchanging advice, syncing our schedules, and reviewing every plan. The president's advisers in my opinion could be overly fretful about appearances. At one point several years later, when I decided to get bangs cut into my hair, my staff would feel the need to first run the idea past Barack's staff, just to make sure there wouldn't be a problem.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我一直提醒自己不要越界，学习其他第一夫人成功的经验，避免过于直接、过于明显地参与白宫西翼的政治事务。于是，我将与西翼办公室的日常沟通统统交给了我的办公室工作人员，比如就一些问题交换意见、我与贝拉克共同的日程安排以及审议相关工作计划等。在我看来，总统的政策顾问们对外在形象过于在意，比如说，几年之后有那么一刻，我想给自己剪个有刘海的发型，可是我的工作人员认为我应该先得到贝拉克幕僚的同意，以确保这么做不会惹出任何麻烦。（我后来确实剪了刘海，也没有惹出任何麻烦，但是我觉得当初就应该直接自己做主，剪完了事。这种换个发型也要事先征得同意的做法实在是荒唐。）">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">With the economy in rough shape, Barack's team was constantly guarding against any image coming out of the White House that might be seen as frivolous or light, given the somberness of the times. This didn't always sit well with me. I knew from experience that even during hard times, maybe especially during hard times, it was still okay to laugh. For the sake of children, in particular, you had to find ways to have fun. On this front, my team had been wrangling with Barack's communications staff over an idea I'd had to host a Halloween party for kids at the White House. The West Wing -- particularly David Axelrod, now a senior adviser in the administration, and Press Secretary Robert Gibbs -- thought it would be perceived as too showy, too costly, and could potentially alienate Barack from the public. "The optics are just bad" was how they put it. I disagreed, arguing that a Halloween party for local kids and military families who'd never seen the White House before was a perfectly appropriate use for a tiny slice of the Social Office's entertaining budget.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当时，由于全国经济形势非常糟糕，到处气氛都异常沉闷，因此贝拉克的团队处处都小心翼翼，生怕白宫会做出任何让人觉得轻率的举动。但我并不总是赞同这种做法。根据我的经验，在困难时期，而且越是在困难时期，越需要欢乐，而且，哪怕就是为了孩子们着想，也应该制造一些乐趣。正因为存在分歧，我的工作团队与贝拉克的外联团队还曾因为我的一个想法而争执不休。当时，我计划在白宫为孩子们举办一场万圣节派对，但是白宫西翼的幕僚，尤其是时任政府高级顾问的大卫·阿昔洛以及白宫新闻发言人罗伯特·吉布斯，坚持认为我的这种做法一定会被外界解读为炫耀、铺张，或许还会导致贝拉克与普通民众疏远。他们的意见就是：“这样做不好，会影响民众。”然而，我并不同意他们的这种看法，我坚持认为，为当地那些从没参观过白宫的孩子以及军人家庭举办一场万圣节派对，正好能够有效地利用社交办公室的一小部分娱乐预算。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The garden churned through the seasons, teaching us all sorts of things. We grew cantaloupes that turned out pale and tasteless. We endured pelting rainstorms that washed away our topsoil. Birds snacked on our blueberries; beetles went after the cucumbers. Each time something went a little awry, with the help of Jim Adams, the National Park Service horticulturist who served as our head gardener, and Dale Haney, the White House grounds superintendent, we made small adjustments and carried on, savoring the overall abundance. Our dinners in the residence now often included broccoli, carrots, and kale grown on the South Lawn. We started donating a portion of every harvest to Miriam's Kitchen, a local nonprofit that served the homeless. We began, too, to pickle vegetables and present them as gifts to visiting dignitaries, along with jars of honey from our new beehives. Among the staff, the garden became a source of pride. Its early skeptics had quickly become fans. For me, the garden was simple, prosperous, and healthy -- a symbol of diligence and faith. It was beautiful while also being powerful. And it made people happy.</div>

<div class="line_en">Axe and Gibbs never fully consented, but at some point they stopped fighting us on it. At the end of October, to my great delight, a thousand-pound pumpkin sat on the White House lawn. A brass band of skeletons played jazz music, while a giant black spider descended from the North Portico. I stood in front of the White House, dressed as a leopard -- in black pants, a spotted top, and a pair of cat ears on a headband -- as Barack, who was never much of a costume guy even before optics mattered, stood next to me in a humdrum sweater. (Gibbs, to his credit, showed up dressed as Darth Vader, ready to have fun.) That night, we handed out bags of cookies, dried fruits, and M&amp;M's in a box emblazoned with the presidential seal as more than two thousand little princesses, grim reapers, pirates, superheroes, ghosts, and football players traipsed up the lawn to meet us. As far as I was concerned, the optics were just right.</div>

<div class="line_en">Over the previous few months, my East Wing staff and I had spoken with children's health experts and advocates to help us develop the pillars on which our larger effort would be built. We'd give parents better information to help them make healthy choices for their families. We'd work to create healthier schools. We'd try to improve access to nutritious food. And we'd find more ways for young people to be physically active. Knowing that the way we introduced our work would matter as much as anything, I again enlisted the help of Stephanie Cutter, who came on as a consultant to help Sam and Jocelyn Frye shape the initiative, while my communications team was tasked with building a fun public face for the campaign.

I hula-hooped on the South Lawn to show that exercise could be fun and made a guest appearance on Sesame Street, talking about vegetables with Elmo and Big Bird. Anytime I spoke to reporters from the White House garden, I mentioned that many Americans had trouble accessing fresh produce in their communities and tried to remark on the health-care costs connected to rising obesity levels. I wanted to make sure we had buy-in from everyone we'd need to make the initiative a success, to anticipate any objections that might be raised.

The American Beverage Association had promised to improve the clarity of its ingredient labeling. We'd engaged the American Academy of Pediatrics to encourage doctors to make body mass index measurements a standard of care for children, and we'd persuaded Disney, NBC, and Warner Bros. to air public service announcements and invest in special programming that encouraged kids to make healthy lifestyle choices.
