<div class="line_en">Even with her door closed, Lydia could hear it: the click-click of the suitcase latches opening, then a thud as the lid hit the floor. Their family never traveled. Once, when Hannah was still a baby, they'd visited Gettysburg and Philadelphia. Their father had plotted out the whole trip in the road atlas, a chain of places so steeped in Americana that it oozed out everywhere: in the names of the gas stations -- Valley Forge Diesel -- and in the diner specials when they stopped for lunch -- Gettystown Shrimp, William Penn's Pork Tenderloin. Then, at every restaurant, the waitresses had stared at her father, then at her mother, then at her and Nath and Hannah, and she knew, even as a child, that they'd never come back. Since then, their father had taught summer classes every year, as if -- she rightly suspected -- to avoid raising the question of family vacations.</div>

<div class="line_en">In April, home was the last place Nath wanted to be. All month -- weeks before his visit to campus -- he stacked books and clothes in a growing pile. Every evening before bed, he slipped the letter from beneath his pillow and reread it, savoring the details: a junior from Albany, Andrew Bynner, an astrophysics major, would escort him around campus, engage him in intellectual and practical discussions over meals in the dining hall, and host him for the long weekend. Friday to Monday, he thought, looking at his plane tickets; ninety-six hours. By the time he took his suitcase down, after Lydia's birthday dinner, he had already sorted the things he'd take with him from those he'd leave behind.</div>

<div class="line_en">In Nath's room, a drawer shut with a bang. Lydia leaned back on her bed and propped her heels on the postcard of Einstein. In her mouth, the sick-sweet taste of frosting still lingered; in her stomach, the birthday cake roiled. At the end of summer, she thought, Nath would pack not just the one suitcase but a trunk and a stack of boxes, all his books and all his clothes, everything he owned. The telescope would disappear from the corner; the stacks of aeronautics magazines would vanish from the closet. A band of dust would border the bare shelves, clean wood at the back where the books had once stood. Every drawer, when she opened it, would be empty. Even the sheets on his bed would be gone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="内斯的房间里传来抽屉猛然关闭的声音。莉迪亚靠在床上，脚跟顶着爱因斯坦明信片。她嘴里还有又甜又腻的糖霜味，生日蛋糕在她胃里翻腾。夏季结束时，她想，内斯要收拾的就不止一个手提箱了，而是一只大皮箱和一叠纸箱，带走他所有的书和衣服，所有属于他的东西。他的房间角落里不会再有望远镜，柜子里的航空学杂志也会消失，空书架上将落满灰尘。每只抽屉——当她敞开它们——都将是空的。连他的床单也会消失不见。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He held up two shirts, a hanger in each hand, so they flanked his face like curtains. On his left, a plain blue, his best dress shirt, the one he had worn to his junior award ceremony last spring. On the right, a paisley she'd never seen before, a price tag still dangling from the cuff.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他举起两件衬衫，一手拿着一个衣架，衬衫挂在上面像帘子一样。左手那件是蓝色的，是他最好的正装衬衫，去年春天，他穿着它参加了高二的颁奖典礼；右手那件则有旋涡花纹，她从来没见过，袖口上还挂着吊牌。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Where'd you get that?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你从哪儿弄来的那一件？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Bought it," Nath said with a grin. All his life, whenever he needed new clothes, their mother dragged him to Decker's Department Store, and he agreed to anything she picked out in order to go home faster. Last week, counting over his ninety-six hours, he had driven himself to the mall for the first time and bought this shirt, plucking the bright pattern from the rack. It had felt like buying a new skin, and now his sister sensed this, too.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“买的。”内斯笑着说。以前，当他需要衣服的时候，玛丽琳就会把他拖到德克尔百货商店，为了早点回家，母亲给他挑什么他就要什么。上星期，他在倒数访问时间的时候，第一次主动开车来到商场，买下这件彩色花纹的衬衫，感觉就像换了一身新皮。现在，莉迪亚也有同感。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"A little fancy for going to class." Lydia did not right herself. "Or is that how they expect you to dress at Harvard?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“穿去上课有点太花哨，”莉迪亚不假思索地说，“或者说，哈佛的人都这么穿？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He disappeared into the bathroom, and Lydia heard the scrape of hanger on shower rod. A mixer: Music, dancing, beer. Flirting. Phone numbers and addresses scribbled on scraps of paper. Write me. Call me. We'll get together. Slowly her feet slid down to rest on her pillow. A mixer. Where new students got whirled together and blended up and turned into something new.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他进了浴室，莉迪亚听到衣架挂上浴帘撑杆的摩擦声。所谓的晚会，就是音乐、跳舞、啤酒、调情，交换涂抹在纸片上的电话号码和地址。给我写信。给我打电话。我们一起玩。她慢慢放下脚，搁在枕头上。晚会，也就是新生们搅和在一起，变成某种全新的混合物。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Nath lowered the hangers. "There's a mixer for visiting students. And my host student wrote me -- he and his roommates are throwing a party that weekend. To celebrate the end of term." He held the patterned shirt against him, tucking collar beneath chin. "Maybe I'd better try it on."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="内斯放下衣架：“他们为来访的学生举行了一个晚会，而且，接待我的学生写信告诉我，他和他的室友还要在周末开派对，庆祝学期结束。”他举起花纹衬衫，比在身前，下巴压着衣领，“也许我最好试穿一下。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Nath reappeared in the doorway, fastening the top button of the paisley shirt. "What do you think?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="内斯重新出现在走廊里，系着花纹衬衫领口的扣子：“你觉得怎么样？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The other one's better," she said. "You're going to college, not Studio 54." But she knew Nath had already made up his mind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“另一件更好。”她说，“你去的是大学，而不是夜店。”但她知道，内斯已经想好了穿哪一件。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Late that night, just before midnight, she tiptoed into Nath's room. She had wanted to tell him all evening about their father and Louisa, about what she'd seen in the car that afternoon, what she knew was going on. Nath had been too preoccupied, and pinning down his attention had been like catching smoke in her hands. This was her last chance. He would be leaving in the morning.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="后来，快到半夜的时候，她踮着脚尖走进内斯房间。那天晚上，她一直想把詹姆斯和路易莎的事告诉内斯：那天下午，她在车上看到的一切，她对事态的“了解”。内斯最近一直很忙，占用他的时间很不容易。这是她最后的机会，他明天早晨就要走了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Lydia bit her lip. The blue pattern against the white suited him; it made him look thinner, taller, tanner. Though the buttons were plastic, they gleamed like pearl. Already Nath looked like a different person, someone she'd known once a long time ago. Already she missed him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莉迪亚咬着嘴唇。白底蓝花看上去很适合他，让他显得更瘦、更高、更黑。虽然纽扣是塑料的，但闪烁着珍珠般的光泽。内斯看上去像变了一个人，变成了她很久以前认识的一个人。他还没走，她就开始想念他了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the dim room, only the small desk lamp was on, and Nath was in his old striped pajamas, kneeling at the windowsill. For a moment Lydia thought he was praying, and, embarrassed at catching him in such a private moment -- like seeing him naked -- she began to close the door. Then, at the sound of her footsteps, Nath turned, his smile as incandescent as the moon just beginning to swell over the horizon, and she realized she'd been wrong. The window was open. He had not been praying, but dreaming -- which, she would realize later, came to almost the same thing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="昏暗的房间里只开着一盏小台灯，内斯穿着他的旧条纹睡衣，跪在窗台上。一开始，莉迪亚觉得他是在祷告，以为自己目睹了他的私密时刻，她尴尬地准备关门出去——好像看到他没穿衣服一样。听到她的脚步声，内斯转过头，他脸上的笑容犹如刚从地平线上升起的月亮，莉迪亚这才意识到她搞错了。窗户是敞开的。他没在祷告，而是在憧憬什么美好的东西——后来她意识到，前者和后者几乎是没有什么区别的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Look at that," he whispered, with such awe that Lydia sank to her knees beside him and peered out. Above them, the sky rolled out a deep black, like a pool of ink, littered with stars. They were nothing like the stars in her science books, blurred and globby as drops of spit. They were razor-sharp, each one precise as a period, punctuating the sky with light. Tipping her head back, she could not see the houses or the lake or the lamps on the street. All she could see was the sky, so huge and dark it could crush her. It was like being on another planet. No -- like floating in space, alone. She searched for the constellations she had seen on Nath's posters: Orion, Cassiopeia, the Big Dipper. The diagrams seemed childish now, with their straight lines and primary colors and stick-figure shapes. Here the stars dazzled her eyes like sequins. This is what infinity looks like, she thought. Their clarity overwhelmed her, like pinpricks at her heart.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“看那里。”他低声说，莉迪亚跪在他旁边往外看。头顶漆黑的夜幕像一池墨水，星光熠熠。这些星星和她科学书上的插图看上去完全不一样，书上的星星模糊晦暗，如同摇摇欲坠的口水，而天上的星星棱角分明，每一颗都像一个完美的句号，用光亮为天空断句。莉迪亚望向远处的地平线，她看不到房屋和湖面，或是街上的路灯。她只能看到天空，又大又黑，可以把她压垮。他们仿佛置身另一个星球。不——像是独自飘浮在太空。按照内斯墙上贴的星座示意图，她寻找着天上的星座：猎户座、仙后座、北斗七星。现在看来，与实景相比，图片上的星座显得呆板稚气，轮廓生硬，颜色单调，形状牵强。而眼前的星星像衣服上的亮片一样对她眨着眼睛。“这就是所谓的‘无限’。”她想。星光澄明，令她倾倒，如同针尖刺在她的心上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Nath," she began. The rush of things she wanted to say churned in her head: I saw. I think. I need. Such a large thing to break into tiny granules of words. Nath didn't seem to notice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“内斯，”她说，不知道该怎么起头，“我看见……我认为……我需要……”于是，一件重要的事情被拆解为一些零碎的措辞，然而，内斯似乎没发觉她的纠结。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The next morning, as Nath tucked his toothbrush into its case, Lydia hovered in the doorway. In ten minutes, their father would drive him to the airport in Cleveland, where TWA would carry him to New York, then Boston. It was four thirty A. M.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天一早，内斯把牙刷塞进箱子的时候，莉迪亚在走廊里徘徊。十分钟后，他们的父亲会开车送他去克利夫兰的机场，环球航空公司将带他去纽约，然后到波士顿。现在是凌晨四点三十分。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Isn't that amazing," Nath's voice said softly, out of the darkness. Already he sounded light-years away.</div>

<div class="line_en">Much later, when Lydia came downstairs for breakfast, she could almost pretend that nothing had changed. Her homework lay beside her breakfast bowl with four little ticks in the margin; across the table, Hannah picked pebbles of cereal from her bowl. Their mother sipped oolong and leafed through the newspaper. Only one thing was different: Nath's place was empty. As if he had never been there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="过了很久，莉迪亚下楼吃早饭，她几乎可以假装什么都没发生过。她的家庭作业放在粥碗旁边，本子的空白处有四个小对勾；桌子对面，汉娜正从她的碗里捞起成坨的麦片。她们的母亲呷着乌龙茶，翻阅报纸。只有一个地方不一样：内斯的座位是空的，仿佛他从来没在那里坐过。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Yeah," Lydia heard her own voice say, barely a whisper. "Amazing."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是啊。”莉迪亚听见自己说，几乎是在耳语，“神奇。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Sure," Nath said. He stretched the elastic straps over his folded clothes in a neat X and clapped the suitcase shut.</div>

<div class="line_en">Nath did not call that night, when Lydia shrank and shriveled beneath her parents' undeflected attention. I got a course catalog from the college -- do you want to take statistics this summer? Anyone ask you to prom yet? Well, I'm sure someone will soon. He did not call Saturday, when Lydia cried herself to sleep, or on Sunday, when she awoke with eyes still scalding. So this is what it will be like, she thought to herself.

<div class="line_en">With Nath gone, Hannah followed Lydia like a puppy, scampering to her door each morning before Lydia's clock radio had even gone off, her voice breathless, just short of a pant. Guess what? Lydia, guess what? It was never guessable and never important: it was raining; there were pancakes for breakfast; there was a blue jay in the spruce tree. Each day, all day, she trailed Lydia suggesting things they could do -- We could play Life, we could watch the Friday Night Movie, we could make Jiffy Pop. All her life, Hannah had hovered at a distance from her brother and sister, and Lydia and Nath had tacitly tolerated their small, awkward moon. Now Lydia noticed a thousand little things about her sister: the way she twitched her nose once-twice, fast as a rabbit, when she was talking; the habit she had of standing on her toes, as if she had on invisible high heels. And then, Sunday afternoon, as Hannah climbed into the wedges Lydia had kicked off, she delivered her latest idea -- We could go play by the lake. Lydia, let's go play by the lake -- and Lydia noticed something else, shiny and silver beneath Hannah's shirt.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="内斯走了，汉娜开始像小狗一样跟着莉迪亚。每天早晨，莉迪亚的闹钟一响，汉娜就蹦蹦跳跳地来到姐姐房间门口，激动地说：“你猜怎么了？莉迪亚，你猜怎么了？”但她根本猜不出来，而且答案从来不是什么重要的事，比方说，下雨了，早餐吃薄烤饼，云杉树上出现了一只蓝松鸦。每一天，一整天，她都会跟着莉迪亚，不停地提建议——我们玩过家家吧，我们来搞一个周五晚上的电影之夜吧，我们做爆米花吧。莉迪亚一生都与她的哥哥和妹妹保持一定距离，对于汉娜这颗可怕的小卫星，莉迪亚和内斯采取的是默默容忍的态度。现在，莉迪亚发现了妹妹的很多小特点：她说话的时候，会不时抽两下鼻子，像兔子一样快；她习惯踮脚站着，像是穿了隐形的高跟鞋。星期天下午，汉娜刚把脚伸进莉迪亚踢到地上的坡跟鞋，就又冒出了新的主意：“我们去湖边玩吧。莉迪亚，我们去湖边玩吧。”莉迪亚却注意到了别的事情：汉娜的衬衣里面，有个银色的东西在闪闪发光。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">With a loud crack, her hand struck Hannah's cheek, knocking her back, snapping her head to the side. Then she looped her whole hand through the chain and twisted, hard, jerking her forward like a dog on a choke collar. I'm sorry, Hannah began, but nothing emerged except a soft gasp. Lydia twisted harder. Then the necklace snapped, and both sisters found they could breathe again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她的手“啪”的一声打在汉娜脸上，汉娜向后退，头歪到一边。接着，莉迪亚一把抓过链子，用力一拧，像拽着狗项圈一样把妹妹拽过来。“对不起。”汉娜想说，但是她被勒得出不了声。莉迪亚拧得更紧了，然后，项链断了，姐妹俩同时发现，她们又可以呼吸了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="汉娜想背过身去，但莉迪亚拉下她的领口，里面的东西露出了一半：一条柔软的银链子和一个银色的心形坠子。她的挂坠。她勾住链子，汉娜开始摇晃，从莉迪亚的鞋里“噗通”一下摔了出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hannah glanced at the doorway, as if the correct answer might be painted on the wall. Six days ago she had found the little velvet box beneath Lydia's bed. "I didn't think you wanted it," she whispered. Lydia wasn't listening. Every time you look at this, she heard her father say, just remember what really matters. Being sociable. Being popular. Blending in. You don't feel like smiling? Then what? Force yourself to smile. Don't criticize, condemn, or complain. Hannah, so pleased in that little silver snare, looked like her younger self -- timid, gawky, shoulders just beginning to stoop under the weight of something that seemed so thin and silver and light.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汉娜朝走廊看了一眼，好像正确答案就贴在墙上。六天前，她在莉迪亚床下发现了那个丝绒小盒。“我以为你不要它了。”她小声说。莉迪亚没在听。“每当你看到它，”她仿佛听到父亲的声音，“不要忘记什么才是真正重要的。”合群。受欢迎。适应环境。你不想微笑？怎么办？逼自己笑。避免批评、谴责或者抱怨。戴着那副银色的小枷锁，汉娜是如此开心，就像莉迪亚小的时候——既胆小又迟钝，刚刚来到可以肩负如此轻细且泛着银光的东西的年纪。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你不需要这个，”莉迪亚说，她声音里的和蔼让汉娜感到震惊，莉迪亚自己也吃了一惊，“听我说，你觉得你需要，但是你不需要。”她握住项链，“答应我，你再也不会戴上它了，永远不会。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hannah kept her word: later that night, and for years to come, she would look back on this moment, each time touching her throat, where the red mark of the chain had long since faded away. Lydia had looked more anxious than angry, the necklace dangling from her fingers like a dead snake; she had sounded almost sad, as if she had done something wrong, not Hannah. The necklace was, in fact, the last thing Hannah would ever steal. But this moment, this last talk with her sister, would puzzle her for a long time.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Nath," Lydia said. "It's me." To her surprise, tears welled in her eyes just at the sound of his voice -- though his voice was deeper and blunter than usual, as if he had a cold. In fact, Nath was three-quarters through the first beer of his life, and the room was beginning to take on a warmish glow. Now his sister's voice -- flattened by long distance -- sliced through that glow like a blunt knife.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“内斯，”莉迪亚说，“是我。”她惊讶地发觉，一听到内斯的声音，泪水竟然涌出了她的眼眶——他的声音比平常更低沉，更沙哑，好像感冒了一样。实际上，内斯现在已经喝掉了他人生中第一瓶啤酒的三分之一，整个房间在他眼中正散发出温暖的亮光。而他妹妹的声音——因为是长途线路而变得单调——像一把钝刀子，截断了那些闪光。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That evening, in the safety of her room, Lydia pulled out the piece of loose-leaf on which Nath had scrawled his host student's number. After dinner -- when her father retreated to his study and her mother settled into the living room -- she unfolded it and picked up the telephone on the landing. The phone rang six times before someone answered and, in the background, she could hear the raucous sounds of a party just getting under way. "Who?" the voice on the other end said, twice, and at last Lydia gave up whispering and snapped, "Nathan Lee. The visiting student. Nathan Lee." Minutes ticked by, each ratcheting up the long-distance charge -- though by the time the bill came, James would be too devastated to notice. Downstairs, Marilyn clicked the television dial around and around: Rhoda. Six Million Dollar Man. Quincy. Rhoda again. Then, finally, Nath came on the line.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天晚上，莉迪亚从她房间的保险柜里拿出一张纸片，内斯在上面写了接待他的那名哈佛学生的电话号码。晚饭后，等到詹姆斯回书房、玛丽琳走进客厅之后，她打开那张纸，拿起楼梯平台上的电话。铃声响了六次才有人来接，从嘈杂的背景音判断，那边正在开派对。“找谁？”线路另一头的人问。他问到第二遍，莉迪亚才提高了声音说：“内森·李。访问的学生。内森·李。”几分钟过去了，长途话费在逐渐增加——虽然当电话账单送到的时候，詹姆斯已经崩溃，无心注意上面的数字。楼下，玛丽琳不停扳动电视的频道旋钮：《罗达》《六百万富翁》《昆西》，然后又是《罗达》。最后，终于，内斯接起电话。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Stunned, Lydia fell silent.

All the words were right, but in this new Nath's voice, they sounded trivial and brittle and hollow. The way anyone else might have heard them. Already her brother had become a stranger.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="莉迪亚目瞪口呆地沉默了。内斯比任何人都了解他们家的生活，包括那些专用的词汇，以及从来不足为外人道的隐情：一本书或者一件连衣裙，并非读物或衣物那么简单；父母越是关注你，对你的期望就越高，他们的关心像雪一样不断落到你的身上，最终把你压垮。虽然内斯的话没有说错，但是，这些词句被他用变了调的声音说出来，听上去是那么的琐碎、淡漠和空洞。他似乎害怕别人会听到他们的交谈。她的哥哥已经彻底变成了陌生人。">查看中文翻译</div>

Everything that loomed so large close up -- school, their parents, their lives -- all you had to do was step away, and they shrank to nothing. You could stop taking their phone calls, tear up their letters, pretend they'd never existed. Start over as a new person with a new life. Just a problem of geography, he thought, with the confidence of someone who had never yet tried to free himself of family. Soon enough Lydia, too, would head off to school. Soon enough she, too, would cut herself free. He gulped down the rest of his beer and went to get another.</div>

<div class="line_en">Monday morning she put on her prettiest dress, the halter-neck with the tiny red flowers, which her father had bought her in the fall. Something new for the new school year, he had said. They had been shopping for school supplies and he had spotted it on a mannequin in the store's window display. James liked to buy Lydia dresses off the mannequin; he was sure it meant everyone was wearing them. The latest thing, right? Every girl needs a dress for a special occasion. Lydia, who aimed for unobtrusive -- a hooded sweater and corduroys; a plain blouse and bell-bottoms -- knew it was a date dress, and she did not date. She had kept it in the back of her closet for months, but today she pulled it from the hanger. She parted her hair carefully, right down the center, and clipped one side back with a red barrette. With the tip of her lipstick she traced the curves of her mouth.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="星期一早晨，她穿上最漂亮的连衣裙，脖子上有系带，印着红色的小花，这是她父亲去年秋天给她买的。“新学期，新气象。”他说。他们当时在买学习用品，詹姆斯在商店橱窗的模特身上看到这件衣服。詹姆斯喜欢给莉迪亚买模特身上展示的衣服，因为他觉得这意味着大家都爱穿它们。“最新款，对吗？在特殊场合，每个女孩都需要一件连衣裙。”然而莉迪亚看中的是不那么起眼的搭配：带兜帽的毛衣和条绒裤子，简洁的衬衫和喇叭裤。她知道这种连衣裙是用来穿着去约会的，但她不约会。她把这件衣服放在衣橱深处有好几个月了，但今天，她把它从衣架上拿下来。她仔细地梳理头发，让它们在额头中间分开，然后用一只红色发夹把一侧的头发固定好。她举着唇膏，用它的顶端描摹自己的唇线。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Don't you look nice," James said at breakfast. "Just as pretty as Susan Dey." Lydia smiled and said nothing, not when Marilyn said, "Lydia, don't be too late after school, Nath will be home for dinner," not when James touched one finger to her dimple -- that old joke again -- and said, "All the boys will be after you now." Across the table, Hannah studied her sister's dress and lipsticked smile, rubbing one finger against the rusty scab, fine as a spiderweb, that ringed her neck. Don't, she wanted to say, though she didn't know: don't what? She knew only that something was about to happen, and that nothing she could say or do would prevent it. When Lydia had gone, she seized her spoon and mashed the soggy cereal in her bowl to a pulp.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你真漂亮，”吃早饭时，詹姆斯说，“像苏珊·戴伊。”莉迪亚笑了笑，什么也没说。玛丽琳说：“莉迪亚，放学后回家不要太晚，内斯会回来吃晚饭。”这时她也没说话。詹姆斯戳戳她的酒窝——又开始逗她了——说：“现在，所有的男生都会围着你转。”她依然没说话。桌子对面的汉娜研究着姐姐的连衣裙、涂了唇膏的微笑，不由得伸出一根手指，摸了摸脖子上的伤痕，感觉它像绕在脖子上的蜘蛛网。“不要。”汉娜想说，但她并不清楚“不要干什么”。她只知道有什么事情要发生了，但她无论说什么、做什么，都不能阻止它的发生。莉迪亚走了之后，她握着勺子，把碗里湿透了的麦片捣成烂泥。">查看中文翻译</div>

On a Friday night, half a dozen cars would cluster there, windows slowly fogging, until a police car scattered them away. Now -- in the bright light of a Monday afternoon -- there was no one else around.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="汉娜是对的。那天下午，在莉迪亚的建议下，杰克开车来到俯瞰全镇的制高点——波恩特，他们把车停在树荫里。在星期五的晚上，常会有五六辆车聚在这里，车窗慢慢被雾气笼罩，直到被一辆警车驱散开去。然而现在——在星期一的晴朗白天——周围并没有其他人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Tonight, I think." In fact, Lydia knew, Nath would land at Hopkins Airport in Cleveland at five nineteen. He and their father would be home at six thirty.

<div class="line_cn" title="“今晚，我想。”其实莉迪亚知道，内斯的飞机下午五点十九分会在克利夫兰的霍普金斯机场降落。他和他们的父亲将在六点半回家。她透过窗户望着镇中心第一联邦银行的钟楼：四点零五分。">查看中文翻译</div>

Through the rolled-down window, the new leaves of the maples rustled. A single helicopter, leftover from fall, broke free and spiraled to the ground. Every cell in her body was trembling, but when she looked down at her hands, they lay calm and quiet in her lap.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“也许吧。也许他永远都不回来了。谁在乎。”莉迪亚硬下心肠，稳住自己的声音，“我有自己的生活。”透过摇下的车窗，可以听到枫树的新叶沙沙作响。一片去年秋天留下的枯叶应声而落，像一架坠毁的直升机，旋转着掉到地上。莉迪亚觉得身上的每一个细胞都在颤抖，但当她低头凝视自己的双手时，却发现它们沉稳安静地放在膝盖上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"It's okay. Don't worry. I won't regret anything." He was so close she could smell the sweet saltiness of his skin. "You know, you're not like people think," she said, touching one hand to his thigh. "Everybody thinks, with all those girls, you don't care about anything. But that's not true.

<div class="line_cn" title="“没关系，别担心。我不会后悔的。”他离得很近，她能闻到他皮肤上的咸味，“你知道，你和别人想的不一样。”她说，一只手放在他的大腿上，“大家都觉得，你和那么多女孩……你什么都不在乎。但是，那不是真的，不是真的你，对吗？”他们的视线碰在一起，蓝色对蓝色，“我了解你。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She had never kissed anyone before, and it was -- though she didn't know it -- a sweet kiss, a chaste kiss, a little-girl kiss. Beneath her lips, his were warm and dry and still. Beneath the smoke, Jack smelled as if he had just been out in the woods, leafy and green. He smelled the way velvet felt, something you wanted to run your hands over and then press to your face. In that moment Lydia's mind fast-forwarded, the way movies did. Past them clambering into the backseat, tumbling over one another, their hands too slow for their desires. Past untying the knot at the nape of her neck, past the peeling away of clothing, past Jack's body hovering over hers. All the things she had never experienced and, in truth, could barely imagine. By the time Nath came home, she thought, she would be transformed. That evening, when Nath told her everything new that he had seen at Harvard, everything about the new and fabulous life he was already beginning, she would have something new to tell him, too.</div>

<div class="line_en">As for Lydia: all evening, she asked herself the same question. She did not notice her father's nostalgia, or her brother's illuminated face. All through dinner, and after dinner, after she had said goodnight, that one question churned through her mind. How had this all gone so wrong? Alone, record player humming in the lamplight, she dug back through her memory: Before Jack's face that afternoon, defiant and tender and hunted all at once. Before Jack. Before the failed physics test, before biology, before the ribbons and books and the real stethoscope. Where had things gone askew?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="至于莉迪亚，整个晚上，她都在问自己同一个问题。她没注意到父亲对往事的怀念和她哥哥容光焕发的脸。从晚餐开始到结束，到她对家人说完晚安，那个问题一直在她心里翻腾：为什么会错得如此彻底？电唱机在灯光下浅吟低唱，她陷入倒序的回忆之中：下午她冲下车时杰克的表情，挑衅、脆弱、恐慌。她遇到了杰克。她的物理考试不及格。她选修了生物课。她参加科学展览。母亲给她买书，送她真正的听诊器。事情是从哪里开始不对劲的呢？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Later, when they look back on this last evening, the family will remember almost nothing. So many things will be pared away by the sadness to come. Nath, flushed with excitement, chattered through dinner, but none of them -- including him -- will remember this unusual volubility, or a single word he said. They will not remember the early-evening sunlight splashing across the tablecloth like melted butter, or Marilyn saying, The lilacs are starting to bloom. They will not remember James smiling at the mention of Charlie's Kitchen, thinking of long-ago lunches with Marilyn, or Hannah asking, Do they have the same stars in Boston? and Nath answering, Yes, of course they do. All of that will be gone by morning. Instead, they will dissect this last evening for years to come. What had they missed that they should have seen? What small gesture, forgotten, might have changed everything? They will pick it down to the bones, wondering how this had all gone so wrong, and they will never be sure.</div>

<div class="line_en">So every time her mother said Do you want --? she had said yes. She knew what her parents had longed for, without them saying a word, and she had wanted them happy. She had kept her promise. And her mother had stayed. Read this book. Yes. Want this. Love this. Yes. Once, at the college museum, while Nath had pouted about missing the star show, she had spotted a nugget of amber with a fly trapped inside. "That's four million years old," Marilyn whispered, wrapping her arms around her daughter from behind. Lydia had stared until Nath, at last, had dragged them both away. Now she thought of the fly landing daintily in the pool of resin. Perhaps it had mistaken it for honey. Perhaps it hadn't seen the puddle at all. By the time it had realized its mistake, it was too late. It had flailed, and then it had sunk, and then it had drowned.</div>

<div class="line_en">In the distance, the light from the dock shone like a star. If she squinted, she could just make out the dim shape of the dock itself, the pale line of boards against the darker night. When she got a little closer, she thought, she would be able to see it perfectly: the boards worn smooth by generations of bare feet, the posts that held them up just above the surface of the water. Carefully, she got to her feet, spreading her arms as the boat swayed. It was not so far. She could do this, she was certain. All she had to do was kick. She would kick her way to the dock and reach up to the planks and pull herself up out of the water. Tomorrow morning, she would ask Nath about Harvard. What it was like there. She would ask him about the people he met, the classes he would take. She would tell him he'd have a wonderful time.</div>

<div class="line_en">And as she made this last promise, Lydia understood what to do. How to start everything over again, from the beginning, so she would never again be afraid to be alone. What she must do to seal her promises, to make them real. Gently she lowered herself into the rowboat and loosed the rope. As she pushed away from the dock, she expected a surge of panic. It didn't come. Even once she had rowed, stroke by clumsy stroke, out onto the lake -- far enough that the lamppost was just a dot, too small to contaminate the darkness around her -- she felt strangely calm and confident. Above her the moon was coin-round, sharp and perfect. Beneath her the boat rocked so gently that she could hardly feel its motion. Looking up at the sky, she felt as if she were floating in space, completely untethered. She could not believe that anything was impossible.</div>
