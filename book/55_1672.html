<div class="line_en">Why should organisms ever evolve to seek to harm other organisms? The answer is not as straightforward as the phrase "survival of the fittest" would suggest. In his book The Selfish Gene, which explained the modern synthesis of evolutionary biology with genetics and game theory, Richard Dawkins tried to pull his readers out of their unreflective familiarity with the living world. He asked them to imagine animals as "survival machines" designed by their genes (the only entities that are faithfully propagated over the course of evolution), and then to consider how those survival machines would evolve.</div>

<div class="line_en">Darwin gave us a theory of why living things have the traits they have, not just their bodily traits but the basic mindsets and motives that drive their behavior. A hundred and fifty years after the Origin of Species was published, the theory of natural selection has been amply verified in the lab and field, and has been augmented with ideas from new fields of science and mathematics to yield a coherent understanding of the living world. These fields include genetics, which explains the replicators that make natural selection possible, and game theory, which illuminates the fates of goal-seeking agents in a world that contains other goal-seeking agents.</div>

<div class="line_en">Anyone who has ever seen a hawk tear apart a starling, a swarm of biting insects torment a horse, or the AIDS virus slowly kill a man has firsthand acquaintance with the ways that survival machines callously exploit other survival machines. In much of the living world, violence is simply the default, something that needs no further explanation. When the victims are members of other species, we call the aggressors predators or parasites. But the victims can also be members of the same species. Infanticide, siblicide, cannibalism, rape, and lethal combat have been documented in many kinds of animals.</div>

<div class="line_en">To a survival machine, another survival machine (which is not its own child or another close relative) is part of its environment, like a rock or a river or a lump of food. It is something that gets in the way, or something that can be exploited. It differs from a rock or a river in one important respect: it is inclined to hit back. This is because it too is a machine that holds its immortal genes in trust for the future, and it too will stop at nothing to preserve them. Natural selection favors genes that control their survival machines in such a way that they make the best use of their environment. This includes making the best use of other survival machines, both of the same and of different species.</div>

<div class="line_en">Dawkins's carefully worded passage also explains why nature does not consist of one big bloody melee. For one thing, animals are less inclined to harm their close relatives, because any gene that would nudge an animal to harm a relative would have a good chance of harming a copy of itself sitting inside that relative, and natural selection would tend to weed it out. More important, Dawkins points out that another organism differs from a rock or a river because it is inclined to hit back. Any organism that has evolved to be violent is a member of a species whose other members, on average, have evolved to be just as violent. If you attack one of your own kind, your adversary may be as strong and pugnacious as you are, and armed with the same weapons and defenses. The likelihood that, in attacking a member of your own species, you will get hurt is a powerful selection pressure that disfavors indiscriminate pouncing or lashing out. It also rules out the hydraulic metaphor and most folk theories of violence, such as a thirst for blood, a death wish, a killer instinct, and other destructive itches, urges, and impulses. When a tendency toward violence evolves, it is always strategic. Organisms are selected to deploy violence only in circumstances where the expected benefits outweigh the expected costs. That discernment is especially true of intelligent species, whose large brains make them sensitive to the expected benefits and costs in a particular situation, rather than just to the odds averaged over evolutionary time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="道金斯还措辞谨慎地解释了为什么自然界不存在大规模的血腥杀戮。首先，动物不倾向伤害自己的近亲，因为任何促使动物伤害亲族的基因，都极有可能伤害亲族体内所携带的自己的基因副本，所以自然选择过程淘汰有自伤害倾向的基因。更重要的是，道金斯指出，与岩石和河流不同，生物倾向于反击。任何一个演化出暴力倾向的生物体，其所属物种中的其他成员也必然（在平均水平上）演化出同等的暴力能力。如果你攻击你的同类，你的对手可以和你一样强壮、一样好斗，而且装备了同样的武器和防卫手段。攻击同类会伤及自身，是一种极有力的选择压力，它排斥了不加选择的进攻和消耗，也排除了暴力的“压力”释放说和大多数的民间暴力理论，比如嗜血、死亡愿望、杀手本能，以及对毁灭的渴望、索求和冲动。进化中的暴力选择永远是策略性的。物竞天择的结果是，生物只有在预期收益大于预期成本的情况下才会动用暴力。智能物种特别具有辨识力，他们巨大的脑容量不仅让他们能够计算进化全过程的平均胜算，而且能够精确计算特定情况下的成本收益。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The second cause of quarrel is diffidence, a word that in Hobbes's time meant "fear" rather than "shyness." The second cause is a consequence of the first: competition breeds fear. If you have reason to suspect that your neighbor is inclined to eliminate you from the competition by, say, killing you, then you will be inclined to protect yourself by eliminating him first in a preemptive strike. You might have this temptation even if you otherwise wouldn't hurt a fly, as long as you are not willing to lie down and be killed. The tragedy is that your competitor has every reason to crank through the same calculation, even if he is the kind of person who wouldn't hurt a fly. In fact, even if he knew that you started out with no aggressive designs on him, he might legitimately worry that you are tempted to neutralize him out of fear that he will neutralize you first, which gives you an incentive to neutralize him before that, ad infinitum. The political scientist Thomas Schelling offers the analogy of an armed homeowner who surprises an armed burglar, each being tempted to shoot the other to avoid being shot first. This paradox is sometimes called the Hobbesian trap or, in the arena of international relations, the security dilemma.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="争斗的第二个原因是缺乏自信。在霍布斯的时代，缺乏自信意味着“恐惧”，而不是“羞怯”。第二个原因是前一个原因的结果，竞争产生恐惧。如果你有理由怀疑你的邻居，感觉他蓄意将你从竞争中铲除，就是说，要杀死你，那你自然会想到要先发制人，抢先干掉邻居，保护自己。即使你是一个连苍蝇都不愿意伤害的人，只要你不想放弃，不想被杀，你就会感到要去杀人的诱惑。悲剧在于，你的竞争者也完全可能因同样的计算而忧心如焚，尽管他也是一个连苍蝇都不愿意伤害的善良之辈。事实上，就算他知道你本来无意冒犯，他还是有正当的理由忧虑，他会认为，你满心疑窦，担心他将要伤害你，因此准备消灭他；而你也有同样先下手为强的动机。以此类推，无限循环。政治学家托马斯·谢林（Thomas Schelling）做过一个类比，持枪的屋主和持枪的窃贼，为避免自己被射杀，都有先开火的动机。这一悖论有时被称为“霍布斯陷阱”，在国际关系领域，则被称作“安全困境”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">We also know today why "wives" would be one of the resources over which men should compete. In most animal species, the female makes a greater investment in offspring than the male. This is especially true of mammals, where the mother gestates her offspring inside her body and nurses them after they are born. A male can multiply the number of his offspring by mating with several females -- which will leave other males childless -- while a female cannot multiply the number of her offspring by mating with several males. This makes female reproductive capacity a scarce resource over which the males of many species, including humans, compete. None of this, by the way, implies that men are robots controlled by their genes, that they may be morally excused for raping or fighting, that women are passive sexual prizes, that people try to have as many babies as possible, or that people are impervious to influences from their culture, to take some of the common misunderstandings of the theory of sexual selection.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我们也知道，为什么“妻子们”也是男人们应该竞争的一种资源。在大多数的动物中，雌性动物在后代身上的投资都大于雄性。对哺乳动物而言，这一点更加显著，母亲在体内孕育后代，并在生育后哺育幼子。一个雄性可以和数个雌性交配，增加繁衍后代的数量——同时可能让其他雄性没有后代，而雌性即使和多个雄性交配，也无法增加生育的数量。因此，在许多物种中，包括人类，雌性的生育能力就是稀缺资源，成为雄性竞争的对象。但所有这些都不等于说，人是由基因控制的机器，强奸和攻击在道德上是可以原谅的，妇女只是被动的性感战利品，人都是试图尽可能多地生养孩子；并且也不等于说，人不受文化的制约。这些观点都是对性选择论的误解。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">How can intelligent agents extricate themselves from a Hobbesian trap? The most obvious way is through a policy of deterrence: Don't strike first; be strong enough to survive a first strike; and retaliate against any aggressor in kind. A credible deterrence policy can remove a competitor's incentive to invade for gain, since the cost imposed on him by retaliation would cancel out the anticipated spoils. And it removes his incentive to invade from fear, because of your commitment not to strike first and, more importantly, because of your reduced incentive to strike first, since deterrence reduces the need for preemption. The key to the deterrence policy, though, is the credibility of the threat that you will retaliate. If your adversary thinks that you're vulnerable to being wiped out in a first strike, he has no reason to fear retaliation. And if he thinks that once attacked you may rationally hold back from retaliation, because at that point it's too late to do any good, he might exploit that rationality and attack you with impunity. Only if you are committed to disprove any suspicion of weakness, to avenge all trespasses and settle all scores, will your policy of deterrence be credible. Thus we have an explanation of the incentive to invade for trifles: a word, a smile, and any other sign of undervalue. Hobbes called it "glory"; more commonly it is called "honor"; the most accurate descriptor is "credibility."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="智能主体怎样才能让自己摆脱霍布斯陷阱？最显而易见的方法就是威慑政策：人不犯我，我不犯人；准备充分，挺住初次打击；人若犯我，我必犯人。一项可靠的威慑政策会打消竞争对手出于谋利而进行侵犯的动机，因为回击产生的成本可以抵消进攻的全部预期收益。同样，因为你承诺不会率先动手，对手失去了出于恐惧进行侵犯的动机。更重要的是，因为威慑消除了进行第一次打击的动机，也就减少了对先发制人的需要。威慑政策的关键在于威胁报复的可信度。如果你的对手认为第一次打击就足以消灭你，他当然没有理由担忧报复。如果对手认为，一旦发生攻击，你有可能理性地克制报复行动，那他就会利用你的理性攻击你且不受惩罚。你只有持守承诺，不暴露软肋，以眼还眼，以牙还牙，而且锱铢必较，唯此威慑政策才会有效。因此，我们也就明白了为什么些许小事——一个字眼儿、一声冷笑或任何一点点轻蔑的迹象，都能够引发争端。霍布斯称此为“光荣”，常用的说法是“荣誉”，而最准确的用词应该是“信誉”。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The policy of deterrence is also known as the balance of terror and, during the Cold War, was called mutual assured destruction (MAD). Whatever peace a policy of deterrence may promise is fragile, because deterrence reduces violence only by a threat of violence. Each side must react to any nonviolent sign of disrespect with a violent demonstration of mettle, whereupon one act of violence can lead to another in an endless cycle of retaliation. As we shall see in chapter 8, a major design feature in human nature, self-serving biases, can make each side believe that its own violence was an act of justified retaliation while the other's was an act of unprovoked aggression.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="威慑政策也被称为“恐怖均衡”，在冷战时期，也叫作“相互确保毁灭”（MAD）。威慑不过就是用暴力威胁来遏制暴力，这一政策能够确保的和平是非常脆弱的。各方必须对任何失敬的信号，哪怕是非暴力的轻蔑，做出宣示实力的暴力反应，因此，一次暴力引出又一次暴力，进入无休无止的复仇循环。我们将在第8章中看到，自利偏差是人性的一项主要设计特征，这一特征让各方相信自己的暴力行动是正当还击，而对方的暴力都是无端挑衅。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hobbes's analysis pertains to life in a state of anarchy. The title of his masterwork identified a way to escape it: the Leviathan, a monarchy or other government authority that embodies the will of the people and has a monopoly on the use of force. By inflicting penalties on aggressors, the Leviathan can eliminate their incentive for aggression, in turn defusing general anxieties about preemptive attack and obviating everyone's need to maintain a hair trigger for retaliation to prove their resolve. And because the Leviathan is a disinterested third party, it is not biased by the chauvinism that makes each side think its opponent has a heart of darkness while it is as pure as the driven snow.</div>

<div class="line_en">The logic of the Leviathan can be summed up in a triangle (figure 2-1). In every act of violence, there are three interested parties: the aggressor, the victim, and a bystander. Each has a motive for violence: the aggressor to prey upon the victim, the victim to retaliate, the bystander to minimize collateral damage from their fight. Violence between the combatants may be called war; violence by the bystander against the combatants may be called law. The Leviathan theory, in a nutshell, is that law is better than war. Hobbes's theory makes a testable prediction about the history of violence. The Leviathan made its first appearance in a late act in the human pageant. Archaeologists tell us that humans lived in a state of anarchy until the emergence of civilization some five thousand years ago, when sedentary farmers first coalesced into cities and states and developed the first governments. If Hobbes's theory is right, this transition should also have ushered in the first major historical decline in violence. Before the advent of civilization, when men lived without "a common power to keep them all in awe," their lives should have been nastier, more brutish, and shorter than when peace was imposed on them by armed authorities, a development I will call the Pacification Process. Hobbes claimed that "savage people in many places in America" lived in a state of violent anarchy, but he gave no specifics as to whom he had in mind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="利维坦的逻辑，可以用下面这个三角形来概括（图2—1）。在每一个暴力行为中，都有三个利害关系人：侵犯者、受害者和旁观者。三方都有暴力动机：侵犯者要捕获受害者，受害者要进行报复，而旁观者要尽量减少另外两方争斗产生的连带伤害。两个参战者之间的暴力可以称为战争，旁观者压制参战者的暴力可以称为法律。简而言之，利维坦理论就是法律好过战争。我们可以检测一下根据霍布斯理论对暴力历史所做的预期。利维坦第一次出现是在人类大戏的尾声。考古学家告诉我们，人类一直生活在无政府状态，大约5000年前才开始进入文明，定居的农民第一次聚居为城和邦，建立了第一个政府。如果霍布斯的理论是正确的，那么，这一变迁应该带来第一次暴力大下降。在文明降临之前，世界上没有“一个让人们慑服的共同权威”，人们的生活应该是比文明之后更混乱、更残暴、更短命，直到某一天一个武装权威实现了和平，情况才开始改善。我将这个发展称为“平靖过程”。霍布斯坚信，美洲很多地方仍有未开化的人生活在无政府的暴力状态，但他没有说明他所指的具体是哪些人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In this data vacuum, anyone could have a go at speculating about primitive people, and it did not take long for a contrary theory to turn up. Hobbes's opposite number was the Swiss-born philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau (1712-78), who opined that "nothing can be more gentle than [man] in his primitive state… The example of the savages… seems to confirm that mankind was formed ever to remain in it,… and that all ulterior improvements have been so many steps… towards the decrepitness of the species."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因为没有资料，人们可以随意揣测原始人的生活状态，当然很快也会有人提出相反的理论。霍布斯的对手是瑞士出生的哲学家让—雅克·卢梭（1712—1778），他的观点是：“没有什么（人）能够比处于原始状态更温和了…野蛮人的例子…似乎确证了人类本来应永远停留在这一状态，以后所有的种种改进…都是指向物种的衰败。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Though the philosophies of Hobbes and Rousseau were far more sophisticated than "nasty brutish and short" versus "the noble savage," their competing stereotypes of life in a state of nature fueled a controversy that remains with us today. In The Blank Slate, I discussed how the issue has accumulated a heavy burden of emotional, moral, and political baggage. In the second half of the 20th century, Rousseau's romantic theory became the politically correct doctrine of human nature, both in reaction to earlier, racist doctrines about "primitive" people and out of a conviction that it was a more uplifting view of the human condition. Many anthropologists believe that if Hobbes was right, war would be inevitable or even desirable; therefore anyone who favors peace must insist that Hobbes was wrong. These "anthropologists of peace" (who in fact are rather aggressive academics -- the ethologist Johan van der Dennen calls them the Peace and Harmony Mafia) have maintained that humans and other animals are strongly inhibited from killing their own kind, that war is a recent invention, and that fighting among native peoples was ritualistic and harmless until they encountered European colonists.</div>

<div class="line_en">As I mentioned in the preface, I think the idea that biological theories of violence are fatalistic and romantic theories optimistic gets everything backwards, but that isn't the point of this chapter. When it came to violence in pre-state peoples, Hobbes and Rousseau were talking through their hats: neither knew a thing about life before civilization. Today we can do better. This chapter reviews the facts about violence in the earliest stages of the human career. The story begins before we were human, and we will look at aggression in our primate cousins to see what it reveals about the emergence of violence in our evolutionary lineage. When we reach our own species, I will zero in on the contrast between foraging bands and tribes who live in a state of anarchy and peoples who live in settled states with some form of governance. We will also look at how foragers fight and what they fight over. This leads to the pivotal question: Is the warring of anarchic tribes more or less destructive than that of people living in settled states? The answer requires a switch from narratives to numbers: the per capita rates of violent death, to the best we can estimate them, in societies that live under a Leviathan and in those that live in anarchy. Finally we will take a look at the upsides and downsides of civilized life.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正如我在前言中所说，以生物理论解释暴力导致宿命论，而浪漫人性论则对人类充满乐观，这两种观点都是本末倒置。但这不是本章要论述的问题。论及史前人类的暴力，霍布斯和卢梭两位都是在做空论：他们对文明前的人类生活一无所知。今天我们应该能够做得更好一些。本章就是要回顾人类最原初阶段的暴力行径。故事要从我们成为人类之前开始，通过观察我们那些灵长类表兄弟们所展示的侵犯性，我们可以看到在演化谱系中，暴力是如何出现的。待说到我们人类自己的时候，首先，我将生活在无政府状态下的觅食群组和部落，与生活在有某种政府形式的定居者进行对比；其次，我们要了解觅食者的争斗和他们争斗的对象。需要回答的关键问题是，战火连绵的无政府部落比生活在定居点的人的破坏性更大还是更小？我们要求答案既有描述，又有数据，并尽可能地估算出在利维坦和在无政府两种状态下的人均暴力死亡率。最后，我们再来审视文明化生活的优势和劣势。">查看中文翻译</div>
