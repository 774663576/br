<div class="line_en">He was lying on something that felt like a camp bed, except that it was higher off the ground and that he was fixed down in some way so that he could not move. Light that seemed stronger than usual was falling on his face. O'Brien was standing at his side, looking down at him intently. At the other side of him stood a man in a white coat, holding a hypodermic syringe.</div>

<div class="line_en">With that first blow on the elbow the nightmare had started. Later he was to realize that all that then happened was merely a preliminary, a routine interrogation to which nearly all prisoners were subjected. There was a long range of crimes -- espionage, sabotage, and the like -- to which everyone had to confess as a matter of course. The confession was a formality, though the torture was real. How many times he had been beaten, how long the beatings had continued, he could not remember. Always there were five or six men in black uniforms at him simultaneously. Sometimes it was fists, sometimes it was truncheons, sometimes it was steel rods, sometimes it was boots. There were times when he rolled about the floor, as shameless as an animal, writhing his body this way and that in an endless, hopeless effort to dodge the kicks, and simply inviting more and yet more kicks, in his ribs, in his belly, on his elbows, on his shins, in his groin, in his testicles, on the bone at the base of his spine. There were times when it went on and on until the cruel, wicked, unforgivable thing seemed to him not that the guards continued to beat him but that he could not force himself into losing consciousness. There were times when his nerve so forsook him that he began shouting for mercy even before the beating began, when the mere sight of a fist drawn back for a blow was enough to make him pour forth a confession of real and imaginary crimes. There were other times when he started out with the resolve of confessing nothing, when every word had to be forced out of him between gasps of pain, and there were times when he feebly tried to compromise, when he said to himself: "I will confess, but not yet. I must hold out till the pain becomes unbearable. Three more kicks, two more kicks, and then I will tell them what they want." Sometimes he was beaten till he could hardly stand, then flung like a sack of potatoes on to the stone floor of a cell, left to recuperate for a few hours, and then taken out and beaten again. There were also longer periods of recovery. He remembered them dimly, because they were spent chiefly in sleep or stupor. He remembered a cell with a plank bed, a sort of shelf sticking out from the wall, and a tin wash-basin, and meals of hot soup and bread and sometimes coffee. He remembered a surly barber arriving to scrape his chin and crop his hair, and businesslike, unsympathetic men in white coats feeling his pulse, tapping his reflexes, turning up his eyelids, running harsh fingers over him in search for broken bones, and shooting needles into his arm to make him sleep.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="手关节受到第一次打击之后，噩梦就开始了。后来，他逐步意识到，那时发生的一切只是初步、例行公事的审讯，而几乎所有的犯人都会被制服。有名目繁多的罪名——间谍、破坏，诸如此类——照例每个人必须招认。招供只是一种形式，虽然酷刑是真实的。他被殴打了多少次，每次持续多少时间，他记不得了。总是有五六个穿黑制服的人同时打他。有时用拳头，有时用警棍，有时用钢条，有时用靴子。有的时候，他不知羞耻地在地上打滚，像一只动物，扭动身子，徒劳地想要躲开踢打，却反而招来更多的踢打，踢他的肋骨、肚子、手关节、小腿、腹股沟、睾丸、尾骨等。有的时候，殴打持续很久，竟让他觉得，残暴、恶毒、不可饶恕的事情不是警卫不停地打他，而是他难于强迫自己失去意识。有的时候，他的神经如此捉弄他，甚至殴打还没有开始，他就开始大声求饶；有时只要见到拳头回缩准备击打，就足以使他滔滔不绝地招认或真或假的罪行；还有的时候，开始他决心什么也不招认，痛得受不了才吐出一两个词；还有的时候，他无奈地想要折中，对自己说：“我会招认，但还不到时候。我必须坚持到疼痛变得难以忍受。再多踢三脚、多踢两脚，那时我再告诉他们所要的。”有时，他被打得站立不住，便像一袋土豆一样倒在囚室的石头地上，几小时才恢复过来，接着，又被拖出去再次殴打。也有更长时间的恢复期。他记不清了，因为在这些时间里，他主要在昏睡或不省人事。他记得一间囚室，有一张空荡荡的床、一张伸出墙面的架子和一只锡制洗脸盆，饭菜是热汤、面包，有时是咖啡。他记得一个粗暴的理发师来给他刮胡子和理发，那些穿白大褂的，公事公办，缺乏同情地给他把脉，测他的条件反射，翻开他的眼皮，粗暴地用手摸他的断骨，在他手臂上打针以让他昏睡。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Even after his eyes were open he took in his surroundings only gradually. He had the impression of swimming up into this room from some quite different world, a sort of underwater world far beneath it. How long he had been down there he did not know. Since the moment when they arrested him he had not seen darkness or daylight. Besides, his memories were not continuous. There had been times when consciousness, even the sort of consciousness that one has in sleep, had stopped dead and started again after a blank interval. But whether the intervals were of days or weeks or only seconds, there was no way of knowing.</div>

<div class="line_en">The beatings grew less frequent, and became mainly a threat, a horror to which he could be sent back at any moment when his answers were unsatisfactory. His questioners now were not ruffians in black uniforms but Party intellectuals, little rotund men with quick movements and flashing spectacles, who worked on him in relays over periods which lasted -- he thought, he could not be sure -- ten or twelve hours at a stretch. These other questioners saw to it that he was in constant slight pain, but it was not chiefly pain that they relied on. They slapped his face, wrung his ears, pulled his hair, made him stand on one leg, refused him leave to urinate, shone glaring lights in his face until his eyes ran with water; but the aim of this was simply to humiliate him and destroy his power of arguing and reasoning. Their real weapon was the merciless questioning that went on and on, hour after hour, tripping him up, laying traps for him, twisting everything that he said, convicting him at every step of lies and self-contradiction until he began weeping as much from shame as from nervous fatigue. Sometimes he would weep half a dozen times in a single session. Most of the time they screamed abuse at him and threatened at every hesitation to deliver him over to the guards again; but sometimes they would suddenly change their tune, call him comrade, appeal to him in the name of Ingsoc and Big Brother, and ask him sorrowfully whether even now he had not enough loyalty to the Party left to make him wish to undo the evil he had done. When his nerves were in rags after hours of questioning, even this appeal could reduce him to snivelling tears. In the end the nagging voices broke him down more completely than the boots and fists of the guards. He became simply a mouth that uttered, a hand that signed, whatever was demanded of him. His sole concern was to find out what they wanted him to confess, and then confess it quickly, before the bullying started anew. He confessed to the assassination of eminent Party members, the distribution of seditious pamphlets, embezzlement of public funds, sale of military secrets, sabotage of every kind. He confessed that he had been a spy in the pay of the Eastasian government as far back as 1968. He confessed that he was a religious believer, an admirer of capitalism, and a sexual pervert. He confessed that he had murdered his wife, although he knew, and his questioners must have known, that his wife was still alive. He confessed that for years he had been in personal touch with Goldstein and had been a member of an underground organization which had included almost every human being he had ever known. It was easier to confess everything and implicate everybody. Besides, in a sense it was all true. It was true that he had been the enemy of the Party, and in the eyes of the Party there was no distinction between the thought and the deed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="殴打不那么频繁了，主要成了一种威胁，一种恐惧：他随时都可能被送回去，只要他的回答不令人满意。他的审讯者现在不是穿黑色制服的暴徒，而是党的知识分子，一些矮胖子，动作敏捷，眼镜锃亮，他们轮番对他进行审讯，时间长达——但他不能确定——连续十个或十二个小时。这些不同的审讯者要让他不断地吃点苦头，但当然他们并不主要依赖这些。他们打他耳光，拧他的耳朵，揪他的头发，让他用一只脚站着，不让他去厕所，用灯光照他的脸，直到他眼泪直流；但这样的目的只是要羞辱他，摧毁他的理性和争辩的能力。他们真正的武器是无情的连续审讯，一小时又一小时，促使他犯错误，给他设置陷阱，歪曲他说的一切，时时宣布他在撒谎和自相矛盾，最后他开始哭泣，既感到羞愧，又身心十分疲惫。有时，他在一次审讯中会哭上五六次。大部分时间，他们大叫大嚷虐待他，他一犹豫，他们就威胁要把他再次交给警卫；但有时，他们会突然改变语气，称他同志，以英社和老大哥的名义劝说他，忧心忡忡地问他现在是否对党还有一点忠诚，来改正他做的坏事。几小时的审讯后，他的神经已经极度脆弱，即使这种劝说也会让他泪流满面。到最后，这种纠缠不休的声音就会彻底打垮他，胜过警卫的靴子和拳头。他成了只是说话的一张嘴，只管签名的一只手，有求必应。他唯一关注的是发现他们要他招认什么，接着就飞快地招认什么，趁新的折磨还没有开始。他招认了对著名党员的暗杀、散发煽动性的小册子、挪用公款、出卖军事秘密、从事各种破坏活动等。他招认，早在一九六八年，他就是东亚国的一个间谍，并领取报酬。他招认，他是一个宗教信徒、资本主义的拥护者、性变态分子。他招认，他谋杀了妻子，虽然他知道，审讯者也肯定知道，他妻子还活着。他招认，多年来，他与戈尔施泰因有个人联系，是一个地下组织的成员，这个组织包括了几乎所有他所知道的人。很容易招认一切，检举所有的人。另外，在某种意义上说，这都是真的。确实，他是党的敌人，而在党的眼里，思想和行动并没有区别。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He was starting up from the plank bed in the half-certainty that he had heard O'Brien's voice. All through his interrogation, although he had never seen him, he had had the feeling that O'Brien was at his elbow, just out of sight. It was O'Brien who was directing everything. It was he who set the guards on to Winston and who prevented them from killing him. It was he who decided when Winston should scream with pain, when he should have a respite, when he should be fed, when he should sleep, when the drugs should be pumped into his arm. It was he who asked the questions and suggested the answers. He was the tormentor, he was the protector, he was the inquisitor, he was the friend. And once -- Winston could not remember whether it was in drugged sleep, or in normal sleep, or even in a moment of wakefulness -- a voice murmured in his ear: "Don't worry, Winston; you are in my keeping. For seven years I have watched over you. Now the turning-point has come. I shall save you, I shall make you perfect." He was not sure whether it was O'Brien's voice; but it was the same voice that had said to him, "We shall meet in the place where there is no darkness," in that other dream, seven years ago.</div>

<div class="line_en">He did not remember any ending to his interrogation. There was a period of blackness and then the cell, or room, in which he now was had gradually materialized round him. He was almost flat on his back, and unable to move. His body was held down at every essential point. Even the back of his head was gripped in some manner. O'Brien was looking down at him gravely and rather sadly. His face, seen from below, looked coarse and worn, with pouches under the eyes and tired lines from nose to chin. He was older than Winston had thought him; he was perhaps forty-eight or fifty. Under his hand there was a dial with a lever on top and figures running round the face.</div>

It was a frightening pain, because he could not see what was happening, and he had the feeling that some mortal injury was being done to him. He did not know whether the thing was really happening, or whether the effect was electrically produced; but his body was being wrenched out of shape, the joints were being slowly torn apart. Although the pain had brought the sweat out on his forehead, the worst of all was the fear that his backbone was about to snap. He set his teeth and breathed hard through his nose, trying to keep silent as long as possible.</div>

<div class="line_en">An oblong slip of newspaper had appeared between O'Brien's fingers. For perhaps five seconds it was within the angle of Winston's vision. It was a photograph, and there was no question of its identity. It was THE photograph. It was another copy of the photograph of Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford at the party function in New York, which he had chanced upon eleven years ago and promptly destroyed. For only an instant it was before his eyes, then it was out of sight again. But he had seen it, unquestionably he had seen it! He made a desperate, agonizing effort to wrench the top half of his body free. It was impossible to move so much as a centimetre in any direction. For the moment he had even forgotten the dial. All he wanted was to hold the photograph in his fingers again, or at least to see it. "It exists!" he cried.</div>

You would not make the act of submission which is the price of sanity. You preferred to be a lunatic, a minority of one. Only the disciplined mind can see reality, Winston. You believe that reality is something objective, external, existing in its own right. You also believe that the nature of reality is self-evident. When you delude yourself into thinking that you see something, you assume that everyone else sees the same thing as you. But I tell you, Winston, that reality is not external. Reality exists in the human mind, and nowhere else. Not in the individual mind, which can make mistakes, and in any case soon perishes: only in the mind of the Party, which is collective and immortal. Whatever the Party holds to be the truth, is truth. It is impossible to see reality except by looking through the eyes of the Party. That is the fact that you have got to relearn, Winston. It needs an act of self-destruction, an effort of the will. You must humble yourself before you can become sane."</div>

<div class="line_en">A needle slid into Winston's arm. Almost in the same instant a blissful, healing warmth spread all through his body. The pain was already half-forgotten. He opened his eyes and looked up gratefully at O'Brien. At sight of the heavy, lined face, so ugly and so intelligent, his heart seemed to turn over. If he could have moved he would have stretched out a hand and laid it on O'Brien's arm. He had never loved him so deeply as at this moment, and not merely because he had stopped the pain. The old feeling, that at bottom it did not matter whether O'Brien was a friend or an enemy, had come back. O'Brien was a person who could be talked to. Perhaps one did not want to be loved so much as to be understood. O'Brien had tortured him to the edge of lunacy, and in a little while, it was certain, he would send him to his death. It made no difference. In some sense that went deeper than friendship, they were intimates: somewhere or other, although the actual words might never be spoken, there was a place where they could meet and talk. O'Brien was looking down at him with an expression which suggested that the same thought might be in his own mind. When he spoke it was in an easy, conversational tone.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="针头静静地扎进温斯顿的手臂。几乎同时，一股欣喜、止痛的暖流遍布全身。疼痛已经忘去大半。他睁开眼睛，感激地看着奥布莱恩。一看到那张轮廓分明的大脸，如此丑陋，如此智慧，他的心似乎又跳动起来。如果他能动的话，他想伸出手来，放在奥布莱恩的手臂上。他从未像现在这样深深地爱他，不仅因为他阻止了疼痛。奥布莱恩是朋友还是敌人，说到底不重要，而那种原有的感情又回来了。奥布莱恩是一个可以交谈的人。也许，理解比爱更重要。奥布莱恩近于疯狂地拷打他，可以肯定，时间再长一点，就会置他于死地。这无关紧要。从某种比友谊更深的意义上说，他们是知己：在某个地方，虽然从来没有明说，但有一个地方，他们可以见面和交谈。奥布莱恩俯视着他，那神情表明他自己心里或许也这么想。他以一种随和的聊天语气对他说。">查看中文翻译</div>

Will you understand, Winston, that no one whom we bring to this place ever leaves our hands uncured? We are not interested in those stupid crimes that you have committed. The Party is not interested in the overt act: the thought is all we care about. We do not merely destroy our enemies, we change them. Do you understand what I mean by that?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"The first thing for you to understand is that in this place there are no martyrdoms. You have read of the religious persecutions of the past. In the Middle Ages there was the Inquisition. It was a failure. It set out to eradicate heresy, and ended by perpetuating it. For every heretic it burned at the stake, thousands of others rose up. Why was that? Because the Inquisition killed its enemies in the open, and killed them while they were still unrepentant: in fact, it killed them because they were unrepentant. Men were dying because they would not abandon their true beliefs. Naturally all the glory belonged to the victim and all the shame to the Inquisitor who burned him. Later, in the twentieth century, there were the totalitarians, as they were called. There were the German Nazis and the Russian Communists. The Russians persecuted heresy more cruelly than the Inquisition had done. And they imagined that they had learned from the mistakes of the past; they knew, at any rate, that one must not make martyrs. Before they exposed their victims to public trial, they deliberately set themselves to destroy their dignity. They wore them down by torture and solitude until they were despicable, cringing wretches, confessing whatever was put into their mouths, covering themselves with abuse, accusing and sheltering behind one another, whimpering for mercy. And yet after only a few years the same thing had happened over again. The dead men had become martyrs and their degradation was forgotten. Once again, why was it? In the first place, because the confessions that they had made were obviously extorted and untrue. We do not make mistakes of that kind. All the confessions that are uttered here are true. We make them true. And above all we do not allow the dead to rise up against us. You must stop imagining that posterity will vindicate you, Winston. Posterity will never hear of you. You will be lifted clean out from the stream of history. We shall turn you into gas and pour you into the stratosphere. Nothing will remain of you, not a name in a register, not a memory in a living brain. You will be annihilated in the past as well as in the future. You will never have existed."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你要理解的第一件事是，这儿没有殉难者。你读了过去时代有关宗教迫害的事。在中世纪，有宗教裁判所。这是一个错误。初衷是要消灭异端，但最终却使异端不朽。因为，它在柴堆上烧死一个异端分子，就会有几千个异端分子起来。为什么如此？因为宗教裁判所公开杀害它的敌人，杀死他们时，他们仍然不思悔改。实际上，杀死他们就因为他们不思悔改。那些人死去，因为他们不放弃他们的真实信仰。自然，所有的光荣归于受难者，所有的耻辱属于烧死他的宗教裁判所。后来在二十世纪，出现了人们所谓的极权主义者。他们是德国纳粹和俄国共产主义者。俄国人镇压异己分子比宗教裁判所更残酷。他们认为他们从过去的错误中吸取了教训，他们知道，不管怎样，不能让什么人成为烈士。在他们将受害者付诸公审之前，他们想方设法摧毁那些人的尊严。通过酷刑和单独囚禁使他们身心疲惫，最后，他们成为令人厌恶、谄媚的倒霉蛋，要他们招认什么就招认什么，辱骂自己，彼此攻讦，哭着求饶。然而，只是几年后，同样的事情又发生了。死者成为烈士，他们的劣迹被遗忘。再问一遍，为什么会这样？首先，因为他们所作的招认是明显的逼供，也不真实。我们不犯这种错误。所有在这儿作的招认都是真实的。我们要真实的招认。尤其重要的是，我们不让死者起来反对我们。温斯顿，你不能再这么想：后人会证明你的无辜。后人再也不会听到你的名字。你将从历史洪流中被清除出去。我们将让你化为气体，释放到大气层中。你荡然无存，名单中没有你的名字，活着的人没有对你的记忆。无论过去还是未来，你都湮没无闻。你从未存在。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then why bother to torture me? thought Winston, with a momentary bitterness. O'Brien checked his step as though Winston had uttered the thought aloud. His large ugly face came nearer, with the eyes a little narrowed.</div>

<div class="line_en">O'Brien smiled slightly. "You are a flaw in the pattern, Winston. You are a stain that must be wiped out. Did I not tell you just now that we are different from the persecutors of the past? We are not content with negative obedience, nor even with the most abject submission. When finally you surrender to us, it must be of your own free will. We do not destroy the heretic because he resists us: so long as he resists us we never destroy him. We convert him, we capture his inner mind, we reshape him. We burn all evil and all illusion out of him; we bring him over to our side, not in appearance, but genuinely, heart and soul. We make him one of ourselves before we kill him. It is intolerable to us that an erroneous thought should exist anywhere in the world, however secret and powerless it may be. Even in the instant of death we cannot permit any deviation. In the old days the heretic walked to the stake still a heretic, proclaiming his heresy, exulting in it. Even the victim of the Russian purges could carry rebellion locked up in his skull as he walked down the passage waiting for the bullet. But we make the brain perfect before we blow it out. The command of the old despotisms was 'Thou shalt not'. The command of the totalitarians was 'Thou shalt'. Our command is 'THOU ART'. No one whom we bring to this place ever stands out against us. Everyone is washed clean. Even those three miserable traitors in whose innocence you once believed -- Jones, Aaronson, and Rutherford -- in the end we broke them down. I took part in their interrogation myself. I saw them gradually worn down, whimpering, grovelling, weeping -- and in the end it was not with pain or fear, only with penitence. By the time we had finished with them they were only the shells of men. There was nothing left in them except sorrow for what they had done, and love of Big Brother. It was touching to see how they loved him. They begged to be shot quickly, so that they could die while their minds were still clean."</div>

<div class="line_en">"That, Winston, you will never know. If we choose to set you free when we have finished with you, and if you live to be ninety years old, still you will never learn whether the answer to that question is Yes or No. As long as you live it will be an unsolved riddle in your mind."</div>

<div class="line_en">Winston lay silent. His breast rose and fell a little faster. He still had not asked the question that had come into his mind the first. He had got to ask it, and yet it was as though his tongue would not utter it. There was a trace of amusement in O'Brien's face. Even his spectacles seemed to wear an ironical gleam.
