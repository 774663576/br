<div class="line_en">When her first school term ended, she decided to go to New York to buy some decent clothes and see some old college girl friends. She thought also about looking for some sort of interesting job in New York. She had lived like a spinster for almost two years, reading and teaching, refusing dates, refusing to go out at all, even though she had given up making calls to Long Beach. She knew she couldn't keep that up, she was becoming irritable and unhappy. But she had always believed Michael would write her or send her a message of some sort. That he had not done so humiliated her, it saddened her that he was so distrustful even of her.</div>

<div class="line_en">When Kay Adams received her college degree, she took a job teaching grade school in her New Hampshire hometown. The first six months after Michael vanished she made weekly telephone calls to his mother asking about him. Mrs. Corleone was always friendly and always wound up saying, "You a very very nice girl. You forget about Mikey and find a nice husband." Kay was not offended at her bluntness and understood that the mother spoke out of concern for her as a young girl in an impossible situation.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="恺·亚当姆斯得到了大学学位之后，就在她的故乡找了个小学教师的职业。在迈克尔失踪后的头六个月，她每星期都给他母亲打电话，想打听他的情况。考利昂太太每次都很友好，每次结束时总是说：“你是非常好非常好的姑娘。你还是把迈克尔忘掉吧，还是另找个好丈夫吧。恺对她的话却并不生气，反而认为，母亲是出于对这个处于无可奈何的境地的年轻姑娘的关怀。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She took an early train and was checked into her hotel by midafternoon. Her girl friends worked and she didn't want to bother them at their jobs, she planned to call them at night. And she didn't really feel like going shopping after the exhausting train trip. Being alone in the hotel room, remembering all the times she and Michael had used hotel rooms to make love, gave her a feeling of desolation. It was that more than anything else that gave her the idea of calling Michael's mother out in Long Beach.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她乘坐的是清晨开出的火车，下午四点左右就住进了她预定的旅馆。她的那些朋友虽是姑娘，但却都有工作，她不想到她们的工作部门去打扰她们，打算晚上去拜访她们。经过累人的火车旅行之后，她实在不想逛商店了。孤单单地一个人在旅馆里形影相吊，当年她同迈克尔在旅馆房间搂着睡觉的往事，一一都历历在目，这使她产生了凄凉之感。这种凄凉之感使她产生了要给郊外长滩镇迈克尔的母亲打个电话的想法。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh, no," Kay said. "I've been busy." She was surprised at the mother obviously being annoyed that she had stopped calling. "Have you heard anything from Michael? Is he all right"</div>

<div class="line_en">"Oh, I see," Kay said. And she did. She felt hot waves of shame that Michael's mother knew he was treating her so cheaply. And then she was angry. Angry at Michael, at his mother, angry at all foreigners, Italians who didn't have the common courtesy to keep up a decent show of friendship even if a love affair was over. Didn't Michael know she would be concerned for him as a friend even if he no longer wanted her for a bed companion, even if he no longer wanted to marry her? Did he think she was one of those poor benighted Italian girls who would commit suicide or make a scene after giving up her virginity and then being thrown over? But she kept her voice as cool as possible. "I see, thank you very much," she said. "I'm glad Michael is home again and all right. I just wanted to know. I won't call you again."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“啊，我明白啦，”恺说。是的，她真的明白了。迈克尔的母亲也认为他这样对待她实在是把她看得太下贱了。想到这里，她心里涌起一阵阵热浪，接着，她感到的是愤怒。对迈克尔感到愤怒，对他母亲也感到愤怒。即使恋爱中断了，也应该保持友谊的表面关系，意大利人连这一点普通礼貌也不懂呀。即使他不再同她睡觉了，即使他不再同她结婚了，她也会以普通朋友的身份而照样关心他。这，难道迈克尔还不懂吗？那些可怜的没有见过世面的意大利姑娘，在失身之后，接着又被抛弃，就想寻自尽或当众人吵大闹。难道他认为她也是这样一个没有出息的意大利姑娘吗？尽管越想越愤怒，她还是尽量保持了冷静。“我明白了，非常感谢你，”她说，“听到迈克尔又回家了，而且安然无恙，我很高兴。我只是想知道一下而已，我不会再给你打电话了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mrs. Corleone's voice came impatiently over the phone as if she had heard nothing that Kay had said. "You wanta see Mikey, you come out here now. Give him a nice surprise. You take a taxi, and I tell the man at the gate to pay the taxi for you. You tell the taxi man he gets two times his clock, otherwise he no come way out the Long Beach. But don't you pay. My husband's man at the gate pay the taxi."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="从电话里传来的考利昂太太的声音显得很急切，似乎恺说了那么一大通话，她根本一点儿也没有听见。“你要看迈克尔，你这会儿就到郊外来，给他来个惊喜交加。你雇一辆出租汽车，我找个人在大门口等着你，好替你付出租汽车费。你不妨告诉出租汽车司机，他按钟点计价可以得到双倍收入。要不然，他就不愿把车开到这么远的长滩镇来。但是，你不要付钱，我丈夫手下的人在大门口等着替你付钱。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I couldn't do that, Mrs. Corleone," Kay said coldly. "If Michael wanted to see me, he would have called me at home before this. Obviously, he doesn't want to resume our relationship."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“考利昂太太，这，我不能去，”恺冷冰冰地说。“如果迈克尔有意，那他早就会到家里来看我。显然他是不想恢复我们之间的友谊了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mrs. Corleone's voice came briskly over the phone. "You a very nice girl, you gotta nice legs, but you no gotta much brains." She chuckled. "You come out to see me, not Mikey. I wanta talk to you. You come right now. An' no pay the taxi. I wait for you." The phone clicked. Mrs. Corleone had hung up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="电话里传来考利昂太太的声音，显得很轻快。“你这个姑娘非常好，你的两条腿倒挺好，但你的脑筋却不够使。说着，她格格地笑了。“你来是看我嘛，不是看迈克尔嘛。是我有话要对你说，你马上就来，别给出租汽车付钱，我等着你。”考利昂太太把电话挂断了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Kay could have called back and said she wasn't coming but she knew she had to see Michael, to talk to him, even if it was just polite talk. If he was home now, openly, that meant he was no longer in trouble, he could live normally. She jumped off the bed and started to get ready to see him. She took a great deal of care with her makeup and dress. When she was ready to leave she stared at her reflection in the mirror. Was she better-looking than when Michael had disappeared? Or would he find her unattractively older? Her figure had become more womanly, her hips rounder, her breasts fuller. Italians liked that supposedly, though Michael had always said he loved her being so thin. It didn't matter really, Michael obviously didn't want anything to do with her anymore, otherwise he most certainly would have called in the six months he had been home.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="恺本来可以再回个电话，就说她不打算去，但是她总觉得她必须见见迈克尔，同他谈谈。哪怕是礼节性的交谈也好。如果他如今在家里，公开地在家里，这就意味着他不再有什么纠缠不清的问题了，可以正常地生活了。她跳下床，马上准备要去看他。她煞费苦心地把自己打扮了一番，衣服也很讲究。要出发的时候，她照了照镜子，凝视自己的模样。比起当年迈克尔失踪的时候，她是不是看上去更漂亮了？或者，他会不会觉得她显老了，不再有吸引力了？她身段长得更富于女人味了：她的臀部更滚圆了，Rx房更丰满了。据说，意大利人就喜欢这样的体型。不过，迈克尔却总是说，他喜欢她那么苗条。其实，这一切都无关痛痒，迈克尔显然不愿意同她再保持任何关系了。要是他有意保持关系，那他在家这六个月里，肯定早就会向她打一声招呼。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mrs. Corleone herself opened the door and greeted Kay with a warm embrace that surprised her. Then she surveyed Kay with an appraising eye. "You a beautiful girl," she said flatly. "I have stupid sons." She pulled Kay inside the door and led her to the kitchen, where a platter of food was already set out and a pot of coffee perked on the stove. "Michael comes home pretty soon," she said. "You surprise him."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="考利昂太大亲自给恺开门．一见面就热情地拥抱她，这是恺原来所没有料到的。然后，老太太又以欣赏的目光把恺上下打量了一番。“你，漂亮的姑娘，”她语气坚定地说，“我儿子很傻。”说罢，她把恺拉进门，领到厨房里。厨房里的一个椭圆形的大浅盘里早已摆好了吃的，炉子上还放着一壶咖啡。“迈克尔很快就要回来了，”她说，“你这一来会使他喜出望外的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The taxi she hailed refused to take her to Long Beach until she gave him a pretty smile and told him she would pay double the meter. It was nearly an hour's ride and the mall in Long Beach had changed since she last saw it. There were iron fences around it and an iron gate barred the mall entrance. A man wearing slacks and a white jacket over a red shirt opened the gate, poked his head into the cab to read the meter and gave the cab driver some bills. Then when Kay saw the driver was not protesting and was happy with the money paid, she got out and walked across the mall to the central house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="果然，她雇的那辆出租汽车先是表示不愿意送她到长滩镇，后来她嫣然一笑，说她愿意付双倍里程费，才答应下来。出租汽车开了将近一个小时才到达。从她上一次访问到现在，长滩镇林荫道的风光已经大大地改变了。周围筑起了铁栏杆，入口处安上了铁门。有一个穿灯笼裤、红衬衫上面罩着白上衣的男人，打开大门，出来把头从窗口伸进汽车看了看里程仪，给了出租汽车司机一些钞票。恺看到司机拿到钱不但没有争执，还很高兴。她下了车，走过林荫道，进了中心大楼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They sat down together and the old woman forced Kay to eat, meanwhile asking questions with great curiosity. She was delighted that Kay was a schoolteacher and that she had come to New York to visit old girl friends and that Kay was only twenty-four years old. She kept nodding her head as if all the facts accorded with some private specifications in her mind. Kay was so nervous that she just answered the questions, never saying anything else.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她们坐了下来。老太太硬要恺吃饭，同时又以很大的兴趣问这问那。她感到高兴的是恺当了小学教师，她来纽约是要看看女同学、老朋友的，她目前也才二十四岁。老太大不断地点头，仿佛一切事情都符合她私下所定的规格似的。恺有点心神不安，她只问答问题，而一点儿也没有提别的什么事情。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She heard the door open and his footsteps in the hall turning into the kitchen and then he was in the open space, seeing her and his mother. He seemed impassive, and then he smiled ever so slightly, the broken half of his face halting the widening of his mouth. And Kay, who had want just to say "Hello, how are you," in the coolest possible way, slipped out of her seat to run into his arms, bury her face against his shoulder. He kissed her wet cheek and held her until she finished weeping and then he walked her out to his car, waved his bodyguard away and drove off with her beside him, she repairing her makeup by simply wiping what was left of it away with her handkerchief.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她听到门开了，听到他的脚步声从门厅转向厨房里来了。他进来以后，看见她同他母亲在一起。他显得无动于衷，然后微微地笑了一下，破裂的左脸抽扯得他无法大笑。恺只说了一声：“嗨，你好。”说得极其冰冷，身子却不由自主地离开了座位，一下子扑到他怀里去了，把自己的脸偎在他的肩上。他吻着她那热泪横流的脸蛋，抱着她，一直等到她哭够了之后，才领她出了门，上了汽车，一挥手让保镖滚蛋，让她坐在自己身旁，一溜烟把汽车开走了。眼泪把她脸上擦的脂粉冲刷得乱七八糟了，于是她索性用手绢把还没有被眼泪冲掉的脂粉彻底擦去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She saw him first through the kitchen window. A car pulled up in front of the house and the two other men got out. Then Michael. He straightened up to talk with one of the other men. His profile, the left one, was exposed to her view. It was cracked, indented, like the plastic face of a doll that a child has wantonly kicked. In a curious way it did not mar his handsomeness in her eyes but moved her to tears. She saw him put a snow-white handkerchief to his mouth and nee and hold it there for a moment while he turned away to come into the house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他回来了。她首先从厨房窗口看见了他。一辆汽车停在门前，车上先下来了两个人，后下来的就是迈克尔。他笔直地站着同其中一个人在谈什么。他的侧面、左脸，她看得很清楚：他脸的左边龟裂了，凹下去了，活像洋娃娃的塑料脸不小心给踢了一脚。说起来也有点稀奇，畸形的脸，在她的心目中却无损于他那潇洒的风度，但却触动了她的心，她落泪了。她看到他转过身要进屋子的时候，掏出雪白的手绢捂着自己的嘴巴和鼻子。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔放声大笑，自己用手摸了摸那被打坏了的左脸。“你的意思说的就是我的脸吗？这，没有什么。只是鼻窦有点不舒服。如今我回来了，也许要把脸修整一下。过去的情况不允许我给你写信或用别的方式联系，”迈克尔说，“这一点你首先必须理解。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Michael parked the car in a garage on Mulberry Street where the owner seemed to know him. He took Kay around the corner to what looked like a fairly decrepit brownstone house which fitted into the rundown neighborhood. Michael had a key to the front door and when they went inside Kay saw that it was as expensively and comfortably furnished as a millionaire's town house. Michael led her to the upstairs apartment which consisted of an enormous living room, a huge kitchen and door that led to the bedroom. In one corner of the living room was a bar and Michael mixed them both a drink. They sat on a sofa together and Michael said quietly, "We might as well go into the bedroom." Kay took a long pull from her drink and smiled at him. "Yes," she said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔把汽车停在一爿汽车修配厂里，修配厂的老板似乎认识他。他领着恺走到一栋相当古老的褐色砂石砌成的房子。这幢房子夹杂在年久失修的房子中间，看上去也很协调。迈克尔用钥匙打开前门，他们进到里面，他才发现里面的摆设既豪华又舒服，简直就像百万富翁的市区住宅。迈克尔带她到楼上的一套房间里，这套房间包括一间特别宽敞的起居室，一间很大的厨房，一问卧室，厨房同卧室之间隔着一道门。起居室的一角有一个专门放酒的柜台。迈克尔掺和了两杯酒。他们俩一起坐在一张沙发上，迈克尔平静地说：”咱们不妨到卧室去。”恺喝了一大口酒之后，对他嫣然一笑。“好，”她说。">查看中文翻译</div>

I didn't call you because it never occurred to me that you'd still be interested in me after everything that's happened. Sure, I could have chased you, I could have conned you, but I didn't want to do that. Now here's something I'll trust you with and I don't want you to repeat it even to your father. If everything goes right, the Corleone Family will be completely legitimate in about five years. Some very tricky things have to be done to make that possible. That's when you may become a wealthy widow. Now what do I want you for? Well, because I want you and I want a family. I want kids; it's time. And I don't want those kids to be influenced by me the way I was influenced by my father. I don't mean my father deliberately influenced me. He never did. He never even wanted me in the family business. He wanted me to become a professor or a doctor, something like that. But things went bad and I had to fight for my Family. I had to fight because l love and admire my father. I never knew a man more worthy of respect. He was a good husband and a good father and a good friend to people who were not so fortunate in life. There's another side to him, but that's not relevant to me as his son. Anyway I don't want that to happen to our kids. I want them to be influenced by you. I want them to grow up to be All-American kids, real All-American, the whole works. Maybe they or their grandchildren will go into politics." Michael grinned. "Maybe one of them will be President of the United States. Why the hell not? In my history course at Dartmouth we did some background on all the Presidents and they had fathers and grandfathers who were lucky they didn't get hanged. But I'll settle for my kids being doctors or musicians or teachers. They'll never be in the Family business. By the time they are that old I'll be retired anyway. And you and I will be part of some country club crowd, the good simple life of well-to-do Americans. How dote that strike you for a proposition?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="迈克尔把手绢拿在手上。“好吧，”他说，“下不为例。你是唯一令我爱慕和关怀的人。我之所以没有给你打电话，是因为自从发生了这一切变故之后，我认为你根本对我不感兴趣了。当然罗，我本来也可以不断地追求你，也可以哄骗你，但是我不愿意这样。如今我相信你，我给你讲一件心事，希望你甚至也不要对你爸爸讲。要是一切进展顺利，再有大约五年工夫，考利昂家族就可以完全合法化。必须先处理一些非常微妙的问题，然后才有可能。那个时候，就是你可能成为有钱的寡妇的时候。如今，我想要娶你到底为的是什么？好吧，就是因为我想要娶你，想要建立一个家庭。我还想要孩子，这是我该有孩子的时候了。我不想要我的孩子就像我当年受到我父亲的影响那样地受到我的影响。我并不是说，我父亲有意影响我。他压根儿不想影响我。他甚至还根本不要我插手家庭事务。他想要我当个教授，当个医生。但是，情况很糟糕，我不得不挺身而出，为保卫我的家族而战。我之所以感到自己不得不战斗，就是因为我热爱并敬佩我的父亲。他是我心目中最值得尊敬的人。他是个好丈夫、好父亲，对生活中遭到不幸的人来说，他还是一个好朋友。他或许还有另一个侧面，但是对于作为他的儿子的我来说，那个所谓另一个侧面则毫无关心的必要。无论如何，我不愿意咱们的孩子也过那样的生活。我想要咱们的孩子受你的影响。我想要他们长大成为纯粹的美国孩子。具有真正的纯粹的美国气质，整个身心结构都是美国式的。也许他们或他们的子孙也会进入政界。”说着，迈克尔笑了一下。“说不定他们中间有一个能当上美国总统。妈的，干吗不能？从前在达特茅茨学院，在历史课上，我们还对历届美国总统的家庭背景作了一点研究，发现他们的父亲和祖父没有处以绞刑就算是托了天福。但是我要安排我的孩子能当上医生、音乐家或教师。他们将来绝对不必卷人地下家族业务。到时候，他们能当上医生啦什么的，那我无论如何也要退休。到时候，你和我就加入农村俱乐部的行列，过一过小康人家的美国人所过的那种美好而朴素的生活。这个规划你觉得怎么样？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"The trouble is all that damn trash in the movies and the newspapers," Michael said. "You've got the wrong idea of my father and the Corleone Family. I'll make a final explanation and this one will be really final. My father is a businessman trying to provide for his wife and children and those friends he might need someday in a time of trouble. He doesn't accept the rules of the society we live in bgcause those rules would have condemned him to a life not suitable to a man like himself, a man of extraordinary force and character. What you have to understand is that he considers himself the equal of all those great men like Presidents and Prime Ministers and Supreme Court Justices and Governors of the States. He refuses to live by rules set up by others, rules which condemn him to a defeated life. But his ultimate aim is to enter that society with a certain power since society doesn't really protect its members who do not have their own individual power. In the meantime he operates on a code of ethics he considers far superior to the legal structures of society."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“问题就是电影和报纸上所宣扬的乌七八糟的那一套，”迈克尔说，“你对我父亲和整个考利昂家族形成了错误的成见。我想作最后一次解释，这是真正的最后的解释：我父亲是一个很讲究实际的人，他竭力设法养活自己的老婆孩子，想为自己有朝一日可能用得着的三朋囚友提供方便；他不接受这个社会的清规戒律，因为这些清规戒律捆住他的手脚，迫使他那样一个魄力超群、性格非凡的人去过那种同他不相适应的生活。你必须理解的一点是他队为他自己是同总统、首相、最高法院的法官以及州长等这样的伟人是一样的，他拒绝按照别人所写下来的清规戒律去生活。但是，因为社会本身不能真正保护那些没有能力的社会成员，所以他首先使自己具有一定的力量，然后进入这个社会，同时，他是按照一套伦理原则办事的，而他认为那套伦理原则大大优越于社会的法律结构。”">查看中文翻译</div>
