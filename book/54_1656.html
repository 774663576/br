<div class="line_en">Stacey's voice faded into an inaudible whisper as Mama slowly put the sewing box on the table behind her. I thought she was headed for the wide leather strap hanging in the kitchen, but she did not rise.

<div class="line_en">Christopher-John, Little Man, and I exchanged apprehensive glances. I don't know what they were thinking. but I for one was deciding right then and there not to do anything to rub Uncle Hammer the wrong way; I had no intention of ever facing a tongue-lashing like that. Papa's bottom-warming whippings were quite enough for me, thank you, The last days of school before Christmas seemed interminable. Each night I fell asleep with the hope that the morning would bring Papa, and each morning when he wasn't there I trudged to school consoling myself that he would be home when I returned. But the days passed, prickly cold and windy, and he did not come.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我、小家伙和克里斯托弗互相交换了眼神，我不晓得他们在想些什么，不过我下定决心，以后再也不会做任何惹哈默大伯生气的事。我可不想像斯泰西那样，被大伯骂得狗血淋头。圣诞假期前几天，似乎格外漫长。我每晚都怀着希望入眠，期冀早上醒来能见到爸爸，但希望总是一次次地破灭。我只能在放学回家的路上，盼望着回家能见到爸爸。日子一天天过去了，天气寒冷而且多风，可爸爸依然没有回来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Y-yessir, Uncle Hammer." Stacey stammered.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“知…知道了，哈默大伯。”斯泰西结结巴巴地回答。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Added to the misery of the waiting and the cold was Lillian Jean, who managed to flounce past me with a superior smirk twice that week. I had already decided that she had had two flounces too many, but since I hadn't yet decided how to handle the matter, I postponed doing anything until after I had had a chance to talk with Papa about the whole Strawberry business. I knew perfectly well that he would not tear out of the house after Mr. Simms as Uncle Hammer had done, for he always took time to think through any move he made, but he would certainly advise me on how to handle Lillian Jean.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一日日的等待越来越揪心，一天天的寒冷越来越难挨。更糟糕的是，莉莲这个星期两次遇到我，都带着假惺惺的微笑。我不知道怎么应对她，因为我还没有想好怎么处理那件事情。我想等到爸爸回来后，跟他好好聊一聊斯特罗贝里的事情。爸爸听完后，一定不会气冲冲地跑去教训西蒙先生。他会认真地思考，给我一些建议。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then too there was T. J., who, although not really my problem, was so obnoxiously flaunting Stacey's wool coat during these cold days that I had just about decided to deflate him at the same time I took care of Lillian Jean. Ever since the night Mr. Avery had brought him to the house to return the coat and he had been told by Uncle Hammer and a faltering Stacey that the coat was his, T. J. had been more un- bearable than usual. He now praised the coat from the wide tips of its lapels to the very edges of its deep hem. No one had ever had a finer coat; no one had ever looked better in such a coat; no one could ever hope to have such a coat again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="提杰也很烦人。虽然跟我没什么直接关系，但自从艾弗里先生带着提杰到我家来还外套，哈默大伯说外套归提杰后，提杰就更加放肆地炫耀那件外套。他天天在那里说外套的翻领如何帅气，褶边如何好看，没有人的外套比他的更好看，没有人能比他更适合这件外套。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Stacey was restrained from plugging T. J.'s mouth by Uncle Hammer's principle that a man did not blame others for his own stupidity; he learned from his mistake and be- came stronger for it. I, however, was not so restrained and as far as I was concerned, if T. J. kept up with this coat business, he could just hit the dirt at the same time as "Miss" Lillian Jean.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="斯泰西恨不得塞住提杰的嘴，可一想到哈默大伯说的不要因为自己的愚蠢去责备任何人时，他又忍住了。他从这件事里吸取了教训，成长了许多。不过我觉得，要是提杰还继续这样到处炫耀，斯泰西肯定会爆发的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The day before Christmas I awoke to the soft murmuring of quiet voices gathered in the midnight blackness of morning.

<div class="line_en">By evening, it reeked of Christmas. In the kitchen sweet-potato pies, egg-custard pies, and rich butter pound cakes cooled; a gigantic coon which Mr. Morrison, Uncle Hammer, and Stacey had secured in a night's hunt baked in a sea of onions, garlic, and fat orange-yellow yams; and a choice sugar-cured ham brought from the smokehouse awaited its turn in the oven. In the heart of the house, where we had gathered after sup per, freshly cut branches of long-needled pines lay over the fireplace mantle adorned by winding vines of winter holly and bright red Christmas berries. And in the fireplace itself, in a black pan set on a high wire rack, peanuts roasted over the hickory fire as the waning light of day swiftly deepened into a fine velvet night speckled with white forerunners of a coming snow, and the warm sound of husky voices and rising laughter mingled in tales of sorrow and happiness of days past but not forgotten.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr. Jamison was silent, waiting; no one else spoke and he went on again. "What John Henry Berry and his brother were accused of -- making advances to a white woman -- goes against the grain of Harlan Granger and most other white folks in this community more than anything else, you know that. Harlan may not believe in the methods of the Wallaces, but he'll definitely support them. Believe me on that."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰米森先生停下来，等着大家说些什么，但没人开口，于是他继续说了下去：“约翰·贝瑞和他兄弟被指控冒犯白人妇女，只是因为这里的白人地位高贵得多。格兰杰或许并不赞同华莱士一家的行为，但他依然会全力支持他们。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the days that followed Mr. Jamison's visit, Papa, Mama, and Uncle Hammer went to the houses of those families who were considering shopping in Vicksburg. On the fourth day Papa and Uncle Hammer again went to Vicksburg, but this time in the wagon with Mr. Morrison. Their journey took two days and when they returned, the wagon was loaded with store-bought goods.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那天，杰米森先生离开后，爸爸妈妈，还有哈默大伯就去找那些想要在维京伯格买东西的人商量。到了第四天，爸爸和哈默大伯前往维京伯格，不过这次他们是和莫里森先生一块儿乘着马车去的。两天后，他们才回来，车上装满了商店里的货物。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Papa looked down at the boys and me awaiting his reply, then nodded slightly, as if he agreed. "Still," he said, "I want these children to know we tried, and what we can't do now, maybe one day they will."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="爸爸看着我们，轻轻点了点头：“是的。不过，我仍然要我的孩子们知道，我们曾经努力过，就算现在不成功，总有一天，他们会成功的。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Hastily Christopher-John and I tugged on the well rope, pulled up the water tub, and poured the water into the bucket. Each of us gripping a side of the heavy bucket, we hurried to the back porch where we deposited it, then tip- toed silently through the empty kitchen to the door leading to Mama and Papa's room. Little Man and Stacey, just leaving the room under Mama's orders, allowed the door to remain slightly cracked, and all four of us huddled against it stepladder fashion.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我和克里斯托弗奋力拉着绳子，把水倒进水桶里，然后两人拎着沉甸甸的水桶抬到后廊，蹑手蹑脚地穿过空无一人的厨房，走到通往爸爸妈妈房间的门前。小家伙和斯泰西刚被妈妈从房间里赶出来，他们偷偷给门留了一小条缝隙，我们四个就紧紧靠在一起，偷偷听着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I wanted to ask more questions about the trip, but Papa seemed in a hurry to be off again and my questions went unanswered until the following day, when Mr. Granger arrived. Christopher-John and I were drawing water from the well when the silver Packard glided to a smooth stop in the drive and Mr. Granger stepped out. He stared sour-faced at Uncle Hammer's Packard in the barn, then opened the gate to the front yard and stepped briskly across the lawn to the house.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我本来想向爸爸询问更多细节，不过爸爸看上去似乎很忙碌，我也就没开口。到了第二天，格兰杰先生来到我们家。我和克里斯托弗那时正在水井旁汲水，格兰杰先生下了车，瞥了一眼谷仓里哈默大伯的车，然后打开前院大门，穿过草坪，走向屋里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr. Granger studied Uncle Hammer. Uncle Hammer wore, as he had every day since he had arrived, sharply creased pants, a vest over a snow-white shirt, and shoes that shone like midnight. "You right citified, ain't you! Course you always did think you was too good to work in the fields like other folks."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="格兰杰先生开始仔细打量着哈默大伯。哈默大伯自打来的那天起，就穿着褶子裤，雪白的衬衫外，套了一件小背心，一双皮鞋锃光发亮。“你倒是挺时髦的，哈？不过，你向来自命不凡，不屑于跟别人一块儿下田工作。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You sure giving folks something to talk 'bout with that car of yours, Hammer," Mr. Granger said in his folksy dialect as he sat down with a grunt across from Papa. In spite of his college education he always spoke this way. "What they got you doing up North! Bootlegging whiskey!" He laughed dryly. indicating that the question was to be taken lightly, but his eyes tight on Uncle Hammer showed that he in- tended to have an answer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你的车子可是惹了不少闲话呀，哈默。”格兰杰先生吸了吸鼻子，用浓重的口音说道。虽然他受过大学教育，可还是改不掉这腔调。“他们让你在北方都干了些什么？偷运威士忌？”他讪笑着，似乎想让这个话题快点过去，可眼睛却死盯着哈默大伯。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Naw, that ain't it." said Uncle Hammer. "I just ain't never figured fifty cents a day was worth a child's time, let alone a man's wages." Uncle Hammer said nothing else; he didn't need to. Everyone knew that fifty cents was the top price paid to any day laborer, man, woman, or child, hired to work in the Granger fields.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不，我只是觉得，一天五十五美分的工资，简直是在剥削孩子们，更别说是大人们了。”哈默大伯没再继续说下去，但大家心知肚明。在格兰杰的农场工作，无论男女老少，一天最多只有五十五美分的工钱。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Uncle Hammer, leaning against the fireplace mantel, did not laugh. "Don't need to bootleg," he said sullenly. "Up there I got me a man's job and they pay me a man's wages for it."</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr. Granger shook his head. "Seems to me you folks are just stirring up something. Y'all got roots in this community. Even got yourselves that loan Paul Edward made from the First National Bank up in Strawberry for that eastern two hundred acres. Course now with times like they are. that mortgage could come due anytime…, and if it comes due and y'all ain't got the money to pay it, y'all could lose this place."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="格兰杰先生摇摇头：“你们这帮人，是想没事找事惹麻烦吧！以前你爸爸向斯特罗贝里的第一国家银行借款，买了东边那两百英亩土地。现在算算看，快到还清贷款的时候了吧…要是到时候你们付不起这笔钱，你们可就要失去这片土地了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mr. Granger ran his tongue around his teeth, making his lips protrude in odd half circles, then he turned from Uncle Hammer to Papa. "Some folks tell me y'all running a regular traveling store up here. How tell a fellow can get just 'bout anything he wants from up at Tate's in Vicksburg if he just lets y'all know."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="格兰杰先生的舌头在嘴里打着转，卷成了奇怪的半圆形。他转向爸爸：“有些人跟我说，你定期从维京伯格往这儿运送商品，只要他们跟你说一声，就可以买到维京伯格商店里的东西。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr. Granger glanced up at Uncle Hammer, then back to Papa. He took a cigar from his pocket, then a knife to cut off the tip. After he had thrown the tip into the fire, he settled back in his chair and lit the cigar while Papa, Mama, Uncle Hammer, and Big Ma waited for him to get on. Then he said : "This is a fine community. Got fine folks in it -- both white and colored. Whatever's bothering you people, y'all just tell me. We'll get it straightened out without all this big to-do."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="格兰杰先生瞥了一眼哈默大伯，又看向爸爸。他从口袋里掏出一支雪茄，用小刀切掉顶端，然后把顶端部分丢进火炉里。他坐回椅子，点燃雪茄，接着说道：“这是个不错的社区。居民们也很不错——无论是白人，还是黑人。要是你们遇到了什么困难，大可说给我听，犯不着闹这么大的动静。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“放火也不睦邻吧？”哈默大伯反击道。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Uncle Hammer laughed outright. Mr. Granger looked up sharply, but Uncle Hammer eyed him insolently, a smile still on his lips. Mr. Granger, watching him, cautioned sternly. "I don't like trouble here. This is a quiet and peaceful place… I aim to see it stays that way." Turning back to Papa, he continued. "Whatever problems we have, we can work them out. I ain't gonna hide that I think y'all making a big mistake, both for the community and for yourselves, going all the way down to Vicksburg to do your shopping. That don't seem very neighborly --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈默大伯直率地笑了出来。格兰杰先生瞪了哈默大伯一眼，哈默大伯也回瞪了他，嘴角的笑依然挂着。格兰杰先生硬了硬口气：“我不喜欢看到麻烦事发生，这是个平静而和谐的地方。我希望它一直保持这个样子，无论发生什么问题，都可以想出办法解决。坦白说，我觉得你们在犯大错，无论是对整个社区，还是对你们自己。你们竟然跑到维京伯格给别人买东西，这可算不上什么睦邻行为——”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Mr. Granger puffed deeply on his cigar and did not look at Uncle Hammer. When he spoke again it was to Big Ma. His voice was harsh, but he made no comment on what Uncle Hammer had said. "I don't think your Paul Edward would've condoned something like this and risked losing this place. How come you let your boys go do it!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="格兰杰先生没有回答，他深深吸了一口雪茄，又将矛头对向奶奶，他的声音听起来尖锐而刺耳：“我想你那死去的丈夫也不会允许你们这么做吧？何况还是冒着失去土地的风险。你怎么这么纵容你的孩子？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr. Granger's eyes showed no surprise, but he pursed his lips again and ran his tongue around his teeth. "The price of cotton's mighty low, y'all know that." he said finally. "Could be that I'll have to charge my people more of their crops next summer just to make ends meet… I'd hate to do it, 'cause if I did my people wouldn't hardly have enough to buy winter stores, let alone be able to pay their debts…"</div>
