<div class="line_en">Mr. Sampson, the buyer, took a fancy to Philip. Mr. Sampson was very dashing, and the girls in his department said they would not be surprised if he married one of the rich customers. He lived out of town and often impressed the assistants by putting on his evening clothes in the office. Sometimes he would be seen by those on sweeping duty coming in next morning still dressed, and they would wink gravely to one another while he went into his office and changed into a frock coat. On these occasions, having slipped out for a hurried breakfast, he also would wink at Philip as he walked up the stairs on his way back and rub his hands.</div>

<div class="line_en">Lynn and Sedley received fashion papers from Paris once a week and adapted the costumes illustrated in them to the needs of their customers. Their clientele was peculiar. The most substantial part consisted of women from the smaller manufacturing towns, who were too elegant to have their frocks made locally and not sufficiently acquainted with London to discover good dressmakers within their means. Beside these, incongruously, was a large number of music-hall artistes. This was a connection that Mr. Sampson had worked up for himself and took great pride in. They had begun by getting their stage-costumes at Lynn's, and he had induced many of them to get their other clothes there as well.</div>

Philip had never paid much attention to women's clothes, but in course of time he began, a little amused at himself, to take a technical interest in them. He had an eye for colour which was more highly trained than that of anyone in the department, and he had kept from his student days in Paris some knowledge of line. Mr. Sampson, an ignorant man conscious of his incompetence, but with a shrewdness that enabled him to combine other people's suggestions, constantly asked the opinion of the assistants in his department in making up new designs; and he had the quickness to see that Philip's criticisms were valuable. But he was very jealous, and would never allow that he took anyone's advice. When he had altered some drawing in accordance with Philip's suggestion, he always finished up by saying:</div>

<div class="line_en">One day, when Philip had been at the shop for five months, Miss Alice Antonia, the well-known serio-comic, came in and asked to see Mr. Sampson. She was a large woman, with flaxen hair, and a boldly painted face, a metallic voice, and the breezy manner of a comedienne accustomed to be on friendly terms with the gallery boys of provincial music-halls. She had a new song and wished Mr. Sampson to design a costume for her.</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip bought a cheap box of water colours, and in the evening while Bell, the noisy lad of sixteen, whistling three notes, busied himself with his stamps, he made one or two sketches. He remembered some of the costumes he had seen in Paris, and he adapted one of them, getting his effect from a combination of violent, unusual colours. The result amused him and next morning he showed it to Mrs. Hodges. She was somewhat astonished, but took it at once to the buyer.</div>

<div class="line_en">The work was put in hand at once, and Philip felt quite a thrill of satisfaction when he saw the costume completed. The buyer and Mrs. Hodges took all the credit of it; but he did not care, and when he went with them to the Tivoli to see Miss Antonia wear it for the first time he was filled with elation. In answer to her questions he at last told Mrs. Hodges how he had learnt to draw -- fearing that the people he lived with would think he wanted to put on airs, he had always taken the greatest care to say nothing about his past occupations -- and she repeated the information to Mr. Sampson. The buyer said nothing to him on the subject, but began to treat him a little more deferentially and presently gave him designs to do for two of the country customers. They met with satisfaction. Then he began to speak to his clients of a "clever young feller, Paris art-student, you know," who worked for him; and soon Philip, ensconced behind a screen, in his shirt sleeves, was drawing from morning till night. Sometimes he was so busy that he had to dine at three with the `stragglers.' He liked it, because there were few of them and they were all too tired to talk; the food also was better, for it consisted of what was left over from the buyers' table. Philip's rise from shop-walker to designer of costumes had a great effect on the department. He realised that he was an object of envy. Harris, the assistant with the queer-shaped head, who was the first person he had known at the shop and had attached himself to Philip, could not conceal his bitterness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="店里的裁缝立刻照图制作。待菲利普看到成品后，心里得意极了。主管和霍奇斯夫人把功劳全揽到自己身上，菲利普对此并不以为意。他跟着他们去蒂沃利剧场看安东尼娅小姐试装，感到万分满足。霍奇斯夫人缠着他问东问西，最后他只好把自己学画的经历坦诚相告——之前害怕室友觉得他傲慢、不好相处，所以一直小心隐瞒着自己过去的职业经历——霍奇斯夫人又把这话传给了桑普森先生。主管什么也没说，但对待他的态度有了丁点儿变化，还让他负责给两个乡下来的顾客设计衣服，并且也得到了他们的满意。再之后，桑普森先生就开始跟客人宣传他手下有个“在巴黎学过艺术的机灵小伙儿”。很快，菲利普就开始每天窝在幕后，只穿件衬衫，从早画到晚。有时手头的活儿太多，他不得不忙到下午三点和那些没赶上吃午饭的人一起凑合一顿。他倒挺喜欢这样，因为同桌的人都累坏了，谁也没有心情说话，况且那时的饭比正点时候的还要好些，因为有些主管没吃完的小灶也剩了下来。菲利普从商场引导员一下升职为服装设计师，引起了整个商场的轰动。他知道自己已经成为众人嫉妒的对象。菲利普在商场认识的第一个人，那个头上坑坑洼洼的哈里斯，原本很喜欢他，现在也难掩满满妒意。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was no use then to withdraw your request, you had to go. The manager's idea was that assistants who were dissatisfied did not work properly, and if they were not worth a rise it was better to sack them at once. The result was that they never asked for one unless they were prepared to leave. Philip hesitated. He was a little suspicious of the men in his room who told him that the buyer could not do without him. They were decent fellows, but their sense of humour was primitive, and it would have seemed funny to them if they had persuaded Philip to ask for more wages and he were sacked. He could not forget the mortification he had suffered in looking for work, he did not wish to expose himself to that again, and he knew there was small chance of his getting elsewhere a post as designer: there were hundreds of people about who could draw as well as he. But he wanted money very badly; his clothes were worn out, and the heavy carpets rotted his socks and boots; he had almost persuaded himself to take the venturesome step when one morning, passing up from breakfast in the basement through the passage that led to the manager's office, he saw a queue of men waiting in answer to an advertisement. There were about a hundred of them, and whichever was engaged would be offered his keep and the same six shillings a week that Philip had. He saw some of them cast envious glances at him because he had employment. It made him shudder. He dared not risk it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等到这个时候，想收回申请也没用了，只能卷铺盖走人。经理觉得心怀不满的人一定不会好好工作。既然他们不配涨工资，还是早点打发走为好。这样一来，只要还想待在这儿工作的人就都不敢再去要求加薪。菲利普犹豫了。同屋的人说主管现在不能没有他，可他心里还是犯嘀咕。这些人都很正直，可他们太喜欢看人笑话了，要是菲利普被怂恿着去找经理加薪，结果却被解雇，他们一定会觉得特别可笑。菲利普还记得自己找工作的那段屈辱，不想再让自己冒着这样的风险赌博，而且他知道自己几乎不可能得到加薪，外面有几百号人画得像他一样好呢。可另一方面，他又急着用钱：衣服都破了，厚厚的毯子也磨烂了他的靴袜。就在他几乎要说服自己走进经理办公室时，一天早上，他从地下餐厅吃完早饭，在过道里看到等着面试的人排成长长一队，大概有一百来个。不管最后选中哪个，他的待遇都会像菲利普一样：每周六先令，管吃住。他看到有些人向他投来嫉妒的眼光，仅仅因为他已经正式入职。这番情景让他不寒而栗。他胆怯地退缩了。">查看中文翻译</div>
