<div class="line_en">"Go on, then," said Harry, raising his own wand to chest height. As he did so, the five wands of Ron, Hermione, Neville, Ginny and Luna rose on either side of him. The knot in Harry's stomach tightened. If Sirius really was not here, he had led his friends to their deaths for no reason at all…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“好，那就来吧。”哈利说着把自己的魔杖举到胸前，同时，罗恩、赫敏、纳威、金妮和卢娜的五根魔杖也在他两旁纷纷举了起来。哈利心头一紧。如果小天狼星真的不在这里，那他就是在把自己的朋友引向无谓的死亡…">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The woman stepped forward, away from her fellows, and pulled off her hood. Azkaban had hollowed Bellatrix Lestrange's face, making it gaunt and skull-like, but it was alive with a feverish, fanatical glow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那个女人离开她的同伙，走了过来，扯下她的兜帽。阿兹卡班使贝拉特里克斯。莱斯特兰奇面颊深陷，显得既憔悴又瘦骨嶙峋，但却洋溢着兴奋、狂热的神色。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“你知道他也是个杂种吗？”哈利毫无顾忌地说。赫敏在他耳边小声呻吟着。“伏地魔？当然了，他妈妈是个巫师，但他爸爸却是个麻瓜——难道他一直告诉你们他是纯种的？”">查看中文翻译</div>

Harry and Neville were now the only two left fighting the five Death Eaters, two of whom sent off streams of silver light like arrows which missed but left craters in the wall behind them. Harry ran for it as Bellatrix Lestrange raced right at him: holding the prophecy high above his head, he sprinted back up the room; all he could think of doing was to draw the Death Eaters away from the others.</div>

<div class="line_en">He was falling down steep stone step after steep stone step, bouncing on every tier until at last, with a crash that knocked all the breath out of his body, he landed flat on his back in the sunken pit where the stone archway stood on its dais. The whole room was ringing with the Death Eater's laughter: he looked up and saw the five who had been in the Brain Room descending towards him, while as many more emerged through other doorways and began leaping from bench to bench towards him. Harry got to his feet though his legs were trembling so badly they barely supported him: the prophecy was still miraculously unbroken in his left hand, his wand clutched tightly in his right. He backed away, looking around, trying to keep all the Death Eaters within his sight. The back of his legs hit something solid: he had reached the dais where the archway stood. He climbed backwards onto it.</div>

<div class="line_en">It seemed to have worked; they streaked after him, knocking chairs and tables flying but not daring to bewitch him in case they hurt the prophecy, and he dashed through the only door still open, the one through which the Death Eaters themselves had come; inwardly praying that Neville would stay with Ron and find some way of releasing him. He ran a few feet into the new room and felt the floor vanish --</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry flung the prophecy across the floor, Neville span himself around on his back and scooped the ball to his chest. Malfoy pointed the wand instead at Neville, but Harry jabbed his own wand back over his shoulder and yelled, "Impedimenta!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利把预言球顺着地板滚了过去，纳威后背贴着地面一转，把球揽在怀里。马尔福调过魔杖指向了纳威，这时哈利用自己的魔杖猛地从肩头向后一指，大喊：“障碍重重！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"The prophecy, give me the prophecy, Potter!" snarled Lucus Malfoy's voice in his ear, and Harry felt the tip of Malfoy's wand pressing hard between his ribs.</div>

<div class="line_en">Malfoy was blasted off his back. As Harry scrambled up again he looked around and saw Malfoy smash into the dais on which Sirius and Bellatrix were now duelling. Malfoy aimed his wand at Harry and Neville again, but before he could draw breath to strike, Lupin had jumped between them.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="马尔福被击飞了。哈利再一次爬起来时四下看了一眼，发现马尔福猛地撞到了台子上。台子上面，小天狼星和贝拉特里克斯正在激战。马尔福又用魔杖对准了哈利和纳威，没等他来得及吸口气说出咒语，卢平就跳到了他们中间。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Harry seized Neville by the shoulder of his robes and lifted him bodily on to the first tier of stone steps; Neville's legs twitched and jerked and would not support his weight; Harry heaved again with all the strength he possessed and they climbed another step --"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利一把抓住纳威肩膀上的袍子，把他整个拖上了第一级石头台阶；纳威的腿还在抽搐、舞动，根本站不起来。哈利再次竭尽全力拖动纳威，他们又爬上了一层台阶——">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He gave another stupendous heave and Neville's robes tore all along the left seam -- the small spun-glass ball dropped from his pocket and, before either of them could catch it, one of Neville's floundering feet kicked it: it flew some ten feet to their right and smashed on the step beneath them. As both of them stared at the place where it had broken, appalled at what had happened, a pearly-white figure with hugely magnified eyes rose into the air, unnoticed by any but them. Harry could see its mouth moving, but in all the crashes and screams and yells surrounding them, not one word of the prophecy could he hear. The figure stopped speaking and dissolved into nothingness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他又用力向上一拉，纳威袍子左边的接缝处全都被扯开了——小玻璃球从口袋里掉了出来，还没等他们抓住它，纳威一只抖动的脚就踢到了它：它朝他们右边飞出大约十英尺，在下面的台阶上撞得粉碎。他们都盯着它被撞碎的地方，被刚才发生的事吓呆了，只有他们两个注意到，一个长着巨大眼睛的珍珠自色的身影升到了空中。哈利能看到它的嘴巴在一张一合，但他们周围到处是碰撞声、尖叫声和叫嚷声，他一句预言都听不到。那个身影说完话，消失得无影无踪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">A spell hit the stone bench at Harry's heel; it crumbled away and he fell back to the step below. Neville sank to the ground, his legs still jerking and thrashing, and he thrust the prophecy into his pocket.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="一道咒语击中了石凳，正好打在哈利脚后跟旁边。石头碎了，哈利仰面倒在下一层台阶上。纳威跌在地面上，双腿还在不停地舞动、摇摆着，他把预言球塞进了口袋里。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Harry, I'b sorry!" cried Neville, his face anguished as his legs continued to flounder. "I'b so sorry, Harry, I didn'd bean do --"</div>

<div class="line_en">Harry turned to look where Neville was staring. Directly above them, framed in the doorway from the Brain Room, stood Albus Dumbledore, his wand aloft, his face white and furious. Harry felt a kind of electric charge surge through every particle of his body -- they were saved.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="哈利回头顺着纳威的目光望过去。在他们正上方是通向大脑厅的房门，阿不思邓布利多正站在门口，他的魔杖高高举过头顶，苍白的脸上满是怒色。哈利感到一股电流涌过全身——他们得救了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Dumbledore sped down the steps past Neville and Harry, who had no more thoughts of leaving. Dumbledore was already at the foot of the steps when the Death Eaters nearest realised he was there and yelled to the others. One of the Death Eaters ran for it, scrabbling like a monkey up the stone steps opposite. Dumbledore's spell pulled him back as easily and effortlessly as though he had hooked him with an invisible line --</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="邓布利多快速走下台阶，从纳威和哈利身边经过，他们再也没有想要离开的念头了。邓布利多走到台阶最底部，离他最近的一个食死徒发现了他，大喊着通知其他食死徒。一个食死徒撒腿就跑，像只猴子似的爬上对面的石头台阶，邓布利多的咒语轻而易举地把他拖了回来，就像用无形的线把他钩住了一样——">查看中文翻译</div>
