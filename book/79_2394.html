<div class="line_en">The sky had been completely clouded over by two-thirty and it had begun to snow an hour later, and this time you didn't need a weatherman to tell you it was serious snow, no flurry that was going to melt or blow away when the evening wind started to whoop. At first it had fallen in perfectly straight lines, building up a snowcover that coated everything evenly, but now, an hour after it had started, the wind had begun to blow from the northwest and the snow had begun to drift against the porch and the sides of the Overlook's driveway.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="午后两点开始，天空便被云层遮得严严实实的，一个小时后，雪开始下起来，这次无需气象员通知，他们就知道这是场大雪，而不是一那种落地即化或被夜间的狂风吹走的小雪。开始时雪是垂直降落的，整个大地披上了一层厚薄均匀的银妆，现在，雪下了一个小时之后，西北风刮起来了，雪便在门廊和饭店机动车道两侧堆积起来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They stood on the porch in the fading light, Jack in the middle, his left arm around Danny's shoulders and his right arm around Wendy's waist. Together they watched as the decision was taken out of their hands.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="天色渐渐暗下去。他们站在门廊上，杰克在中间，左手搭在丹尼肩上，右手搂着温迪。他们在一起看下雪，决定是去还是留的权利从他们手里被夺走了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The hedge animals were also gone, but when Wendy and Danny had gotten home, she had commended him on the good job he had done. Do you think so? he had asked, and said no more. Now the hedges were buried under amorphous white cloaks.</div>

<div class="line_en">So they went in together, leaving the wind to build to the low-pitched scream that would go on all night -- a sound they would get to know well. Flakes of snow swirled and danced across the porch. The Overlook faced it as it had for nearly three quarters of a century, its darkened windows now bearded with snow, indifferent to the fact that it was now cut off from the world. Or possibly it was pleased with the prospect. Inside its shell the three of them went about their early evening routine, like microbes trapped in the intestine of a monster.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，他们一起回到屋里，让风自个儿彻夜不息地发出低吼——这种声音从此将时时与他们为伴。雪片打着旋儿，在门廊上飞舞。远望饭店承受着雪的扑打，黑洞洞的窗户全都挂上了白须，它已经与世隔绝了，但它却对此无动于衷，一如近3/4个世纪以来那样。也许它对这个前景还感到很满意。在它的躯壳里，这个三口之家重复着每晚前半夜的例行公事，就像困在一头怪兽腹中的微生物一样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Will it ever be spring?" Wendy murmured.</div>

<div class="line_en">Curiously, all of them were thinking different thoughts but feeling the same emotion: relief. The bridge had been crossed.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jack squeezed her tighter. "Before you know it. What do you say we go in and have some supper? It's cold out here." She smiled. All afternoon Jack had seemed distant and… well, odd. Now he sounded more like his normal self. "Fine by me. How about you, Danny?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="杰克紧紧地搂着她。“它会悄然而来的。进去吃晚饭吧，怎么样？外面很冷。”她笑了笑。整个下午杰克都有些心神不定，而且…对了，还有些古怪。现在他听起来更像平常的他。“主意不错。怎么样，丹尼？”">查看中文翻译</div>
