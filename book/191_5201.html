<div class="line_en">While the Woodman was making a ladder from wood which he found in the forest Dorothy lay down and slept, for she was tired by the long walk. The Lion also curled himself up to sleep and Toto lay beside him.</div>

<div class="line_en">After a time the ladder was finished. It looked clumsy, but the Tin Woodman was sure it was strong and would answer their purpose.</div>

<div class="line_en">The Scarecrow climbed up the ladder first, but he was so awkward that Dorothy had to follow close behind and keep him from falling off. When he got his head over the top of the wall the Scarecrow said, "Oh, my!"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="稻草人第一个爬上梯子去，但是他爬得这样地笨拙，使得多萝茜不得不紧紧地跟在后面，防止他掉下来，当稻草人爬到高出自己的头的墙顶时，他喊道：“啊呀！”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There were also pretty little barns, with china fences around them; and many cows and sheep and horses and pigs and chickens, all made of china, were standing about in groups.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在那里，也还有美丽的小谷仓和小厩房，四周绕着瓷做的篱笆，许多的牛、羊和马，还有猪和小鸡，全都是瓷器做的，一群一群地站着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But the strangest of all were the people who lived in this queer country. There were milkmaids and shepherdesses, with brightly colored bodices and golden spots all over their gowns; and princesses with most gorgeous frocks of silver and gold and purple; and shepherds dressed in knee breeches with pink and yellow and blue stripes down them, and golden buckles on their shoes; and princes with jeweled crowns upon their heads, wearing ermine robes and satin doublets; and funny clowns in ruffled gowns, with round red spots upon their cheeks and tall, pointed caps.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是其中最奇怪的，是住在这个奇异国度里的那些百姓。扔牛奶的女郎和牧羊的女郎，全都穿着白底有金黄色斑点的外衣；公主们穿着最华丽的银色、金色和紫色的长袍；牧童穿着淡红色和黄色的短裤，垂着蓝色的镶条，在他们的鞋子上有黄色的钮扣；皇子们的头上，戴着用宝石装饰的皇冠，穿着白鼬皮的长袍和闪光缎的紧身衣；还有滑稽有趣的小丑们，穿着皱边的长袍，两边面颊上点着红的圆点，尖顶的高帽子覆盖到他们的额上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Scattered around were many houses made entirely of china and painted in the brightest colors. These houses were quite small, the biggest of them reaching only as high as Dorothy's waist.</div>

<div class="line_en">No one did so much as look at the travelers at first, except one little purple china dog with an extra-large head, which came to the wall and barked at them in a tiny voice, afterwards running away again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="起初，除了一头紫色的狗以外，没有一个人注视到这几个旅行者，它长着一个特别大的头，跑到墙根边，用一种细小的声音，向他们吠着，然后向后走回去了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They began walking through the country of the china people, and the first thing they came to was a china milkmaid milking a china cow. As they drew near, the cow suddenly gave a kick and kicked over the stool, the pail, and even the milkmaid herself, and all fell on the china ground with a great clatter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们开始走着，穿过瓷器国的路，他们遇到的第一件事情，是一个捋牛奶的瓷女郎，正在捋着一条瓷牛的奶。当他们走近去时，那瓷牛突然一踢，踢翻了那瓷凳子、瓷提桶，捋牛奶的女郎自己也被踢着，一起倒在瓷的地面上，发出很大的声音来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When all were safely down they picked up the Scarecrow, whose body was quite flattened out, and patted his straw into shape again.</div>

<div class="line_en">They found the ladder so heavy they could not pull it up, so the Scarecrow fell off the wall and the others jumped down upon him so that the hard floor would not hurt their feet. Of course they took pains not to light on his head and get the pins in their feet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们发觉梯子这么笨重，拔它不起来，所以稻草人从墙上倒下去，其余的都跳落在他的身上，这样，坚硬的地面，不会碰伤他们的脚。当然，他们的脚不落在稻草人的头上，不然，给钉子戳进脚里，就要受到痛苦。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But the pretty milkmaid was much too vexed to make any answer. She picked up the leg sulkily and led her cow away, the poor animal limping on three legs. As she left them the milkmaid cast many reproachful glances over her shoulder at the clumsy strangers, holding her nicked elbow close to her side.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是这个美丽的捋牛奶女郎，太被激怒了，不理睬他们。她愤怒地拾起断腿，牵着牛走了，那可怜的畜生，只好三只脚踏行着。当那捋牛奶的女郎离开了他们，对于这些愚笨的陌生客人，回过头来，从她的肩上面，投掷了好多次含有责备的瞥视，并只把她的受伤的臂膀，靠紧了她的身边。">查看中文翻译</div>
