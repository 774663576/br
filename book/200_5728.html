<div class="line_en">For answer she spread the newspaper on the table in front of them and pointed at ten black-and-white photographs that filled the whole of the front page, nine showing wizards' faces and the tenth, a witch's.

Each picture was captioned with a name and the crime for which the person had been sent to Azkaban.</div>

<div class="line_en">But Harry's eyes were drawn to the picture of the witch. Her face had leapt out at him the moment he had seen the page. She had long, dark hair that looked unkempt and straggly in the picture, though he had seen it sleek, thick and shining. She glared up at him through heavily lidded eyes, an arrogant, disdainful smile playing around her thin mouth. Like Sirius, she retained vestiges of great good looks, but something -- perhaps Azkaban -- had taken most of her beauty.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但哈利的目光被那个女巫吸引了。第一眼看报纸时她的面孔就跳入了他的眼帘，她黑色的长发在照片上显得乱蓬蓬的，但哈利见过它光滑乌亮的样子。她厚眼皮下的眼睛瞪着他，薄嘴唇上浮现出一丝高傲的、轻蔑的微笑。像小天狼星一样，她还保留着一些俊美的痕迹，但某种东西——也许是阿兹卡班，已经夺走了她大部分的美丽。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"We find ourselves, most unfortunately, in the same position we were two and a half years ago when the murderer Sirius Black escaped,'said Fudge last night.'Nor do we think the two breakouts are unrelated.

We think it likely that these individuals, who include Black's cousin, Bellatrix Lestrange, have rallied around Black as their leader. We are, however, doing all we can to round up the criminals, and we beg the magical community to remain alert and cautious. On no account should any of these individuals be approached."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“非常遗憾，我们陷入了与两年半前杀人犯小天狼星布莱克脱逃时相同的处境，”福吉昨夜说，“而且我们不认为两次越狱没有联系。如此大规模的越狱令人怀疑有外面的接应，要知道布莱克作为从阿兹卡班脱逃的笫一人，最有条件帮助他人越狱。逃犯中还包括布莱克的堂姐贝拉特里克斯。莱斯特兰奇。我们认为这些逃犯可能把布莱克当作领袖。但魔法部正不遗余力地追缉逃犯，并请公众保持警惕，切勿接近这些要犯。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Hermione ripped open the newspaper and began to read the report inside while Harry looked around the Great Hall. He could not understand why his fellow students were not looking scared or at least discussing the terrible piece of news on the front page, but very few of them took the newspaper every day like Hermione. There they all were, talking about homework and Quidditch and who knew what other rubbish, when outside these walls ten more Death Eaters had swollen Voldemort's ranks.</div>

<div class="line_en">He glanced up at the staff table. It was a different story there: Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall were deep in conversation, both looking extremely grave. Professor Sprout had the Prophet propped against a bottle of ketchup and was reading the front page with such concentration that she was not noticing the gentle drip of egg yolk falling into her lap from her stationary spoon. Meanwhile, at the far end of the table, Professor Umbridge was tucking into a bowl of porridge. For once her pouchy toad's eyes were not sweeping the Great Hall looking for misbehaving students. She scowled as she gulped down her food and every now and then she shot a malevolent glance up the table to where Dumbledore and McGonagall were talking so intently.</div>

<div class="line_en">The fact that Hagrid was now on probation became common knowledge within the school over the next few days, but to Harry's indignation, hardly anybody appeared to be upset about it; indeed, some people, Draco Malfoy prominent among them, seemed positively gleeful. As for the freakish death of an obscure Department of Mysteries employee in St. Mungo's, Harry, Ron and Hermione seemed to be the only people who knew or cared. There was only one topic of conversation in the corridors now: the ten escaped Death Eaters, whose story had finally filtered through the school from those few people who read the newspapers. Rumours were flying that some of the convicts had been spotted in Hogsmeade, that they were supposed to be hiding out in the Shrieking Shack and that they were going to break into Hogwarts, just as Sirius Black had once done.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="海格留用察看的事几天就在学校里传开了，并不是每个人都感到难过，有些人，尤其是德拉科马尔福，显得很高兴。至于不知名的魔法部职员在圣芒戈蹊跷身亡，似乎只有哈利、罗恩和赫敏才知道或关心。现在走廊里只有一个话题：十名在逃的食死徒。这个消息终于通过少数读报的人渗透到了校园里。谣传说霍格莫德有人认出了几个逃犯，还说逃犯藏在尖叫棚屋，可能会像小天狼星那样闯进霍格沃茨。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Those who came from wizarding families had grown up hearing the names of these Death Eaters spoken with almost as much fear as Voldemorts; the crimes they had committed during the days of Voldemort's reign of terror were legendary. There were relatives of their victims among the Hogwarts students, who now found themselves the unwilling objects of a gruesome sort of reflected fame as they walked the corridors: Susan Bones, whose uncle, aunt and cousins had all died at the hands of one of the ten, said miserably during Herbology that she now had a good idea what it felt like to be Harry.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="魔法家庭的孩子从小就听说过这些食死徒，他们的名字几乎和伏地魔一样恐怖，他们在伏地魔的恐怖统治下所犯的罪行众所周知。霍格沃茨的学生中就有受害者的家属，这些学生发现自己不情愿地成了走廊上注意的焦点：叔叔、婶婶和堂兄弟都死在一个逃犯手里的苏珊博恩斯在草药课上痛苦地说，她现在深深体会到了哈利的感觉。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was true that Harry was the subject of much renewed muttering and pointing in the corridors these days, yet he thought he detected a slight difference in the tone of the whisperers' voices. They sounded curious rather than hostile now, and once or twice he was sure he overheard snatches of conversation that, suggested that the speakers were not satisfied with the Prophet's version of how and why ten Death Eaters had managed to break out of the Azkaban fortress. In their confusion and fear, these doubters now seemed to be turning to the only other explanation available to them: the one that Harry and Dumbledore had been expounding since the previous year.</div>

She lurked by the fire in the heavily perfumed tower room, interrupting Professor Trelawney's increasingly hysterical talks with difficult questions about ornithomancy and heptomology, insisting that she predicted students' answers before they gave them and demanding that she demonstrate her skill at the crystal ball, the tea leaves and the rune stones in turn. Harry thought Professor Trelawney might soon crack under the strain. Several times he passed her in the corridors -- in itself a very unusual occurrence as she generally remained in her tower room -- muttering wildly to herself, wringing her hands and shooting terrified glances over her shoulder, and all the while giving off a powerful smell of cooking sherry.

The news of his parents' attackers' escape had wrought a strange and even slightly alarming change in him. He had not once mentioned his meeting with Harry, Ron and Hermione on the closed ward in St. Mungo's and, taking their lead from him, they had kept quiet about it too. Nor had he said anything on the subject of Bellatrix and her fellow torturers' escape. In fact, Neville barely spoke during the DA meetings any more, but worked relentlessly on every new jinx and counter-curse Harry taught them, his plump face screwed up in concentration, apparently indifferent to injuries or accidents and working harder than anyone else in the room. He was improving so fast it was quite unnerving and when Harry taught them, the Shield Charm -- a means of deflecting minor jinxes so that they rebounded upon the attacker -- only Hermione mastered the charm faster than Neville.</div>

Nowadays, however, his scar hardly ever stopped prickling, and he often felt lurches of annoyance or cheerfulness that were unrelated to what was happening to him at the time, which were always accompanied by a particularly painful twinge from his scar. He had the horrible impression that he was slowly turning into a kind of aerial that was tuned in to tiny fluctuations in Voldemort's mood, and he was sure he could date this increased sensitivity firmly from his first Occlumency lesson with Snape. What was more, he was now dreaming about walking down the corridor towards the entrance to the Department of Mysteries almost every night, dreams which always culminated in him standing longingly in front of the plain black door.</div>
