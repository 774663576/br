<div class="line_en">As I was waiting, a man came out of a side room, and at a glance I was sure he must be Long John. His left leg was cut off close by the hip, and under the left shoulder he carried a crutch, which he managed with wonderful dexterity, hopping about upon it like a bird. He was very tall and strong, with a face as big as a ham -- plain and pale, but intelligent and smiling. Indeed, he seemed in the most cheerful spirits, whistling as he moved about among the tables, with a merry word or a slap on the shoulder for the more favoured of his guests.</div>

<div class="line_en">When I had done breakfasting the squire gave me a note addressed to John Silver, at the sign of the Spy-glass, and told me I should easily find the place by following the line of the docks and keeping a bright lookout for a little tavern with a large brass telescope for sign. I set off, overjoyed at this opportunity to see some more of the ships and seamen, and picked my way among a great crowd of people and carts and bales, for the dock was now at its busiest, until I found the tavern in question.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我吃过早饭后，乡绅给我一张写给约翰·西尔弗的便条，地址是挂“望远镜”招牌的地方，并且告诉我，顺着到船坞的路线走，会很容易找到那个地方，要特别留心挂着一个巨大的黄铜望远镜作招牌的小酒店。我出发了，为能有机会看到更多的船和船员而感到欣喜若狂。由于船坞现在是最忙的时候，我就在拥挤的人群。双轮马车和成捆的货物中间穿行，直到找到了所说的那个酒店。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was a bright enough little place of entertainment. The sign was newly painted; the windows had neat red curtains; the floor was cleanly sanded. There was a street on each side and an open door on both, which made the large, low room pretty clear to see in, in spite of clouds of tobacco smoke.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那是个非常活跃的小娱乐场所。招牌是刚油漆过的，窗户上挂着整洁的红色窗帘，地面上铺着干净的细沙。酒店两面临街，两边各开了个门，这使得这间大而低的屋子可以一览无遗，尽管里面烟气腾腾的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Now, to tell you the truth, from the very first mention of Long John in Squire Trelawney's letter I had taken a fear in my mind that he might prove to be the very one -- legged sailor whom I had watched for so long at the old Benbow. But one look at the man before me was enough. I had seen the captain, and Black Dog, and the blind man, Pew, and I thought I knew what a buccaneer was like -- a very different creature, according to me, from this clean and pleasant-tempered landlord.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在，和你说实话，从乡绅特里罗尼的信里第一次提到高个子约翰的时候起，我心里就暗自生疑，他可能就是那个我在“本葆海军上将”旅店留心好久的“独腿水手”，但是只要看一眼我面前的这个人，就足以让我打消这个念头了。我已经看到过船长、“黑狗”，还有瞎子皮乌，我想我知道海盗该是个什么样子──凭我的感觉，那是和这个整洁、和气的店主大相径庭的人物。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Mr. Silver, sir?" I asked, holding out the note.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“阁下是西尔弗先生吗？”我问，手里攥着纸条。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I plucked up courage at once, crossed the threshold, and walked right up to the man where he stood, propped on his crutch, talking to a customer.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我立刻鼓起了勇气，跨过门槛，径直奔他站着的地方走去，他架着拐杖，正在同一个顾客攀谈。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Oh!" said he, quite loud, and offering his hand. "I see. You are our new cabin-boy; pleased I am to see you."</div>

<div class="line_en">"Yes, my lad," said he; "such is my name, to be sure. And who may you be?" And then as he saw the squire's letter, he seemed to me to give something almost like a start.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“正是，我的孩子，”他说，“这是我的名字，一点不错。那么你是谁呀？”接着，当他看到乡绅的便条时，他似乎对我有些感到惊奇了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="接着他把我的手拿在他那大而结实的手掌里紧紧地握了握。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Just then one of the customers at the far side rose suddenly and made for the door. It was close by him, and he was out in the street in a moment. But his hurry had attracted my notice, and I recognized him at glance. It was the tallow-faced man, wanting two fingers, who had come first to the Admiral Benbow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正在这时，远远地坐在边上的一个顾客突然站起来，夺门而出。门离他很近，他一下子就窜到街上去了。但是他的紧张吸引了我的注意，我一眼便认出了他，他是脸上脂肪多、缺了两个手指的人，是他首先到“本葆海军上将”旅店来的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">And then, as Morgan rolled back to his seat, Silver added to me in a confidential whisper that was very flattering, as I thought, "He's quite an honest man, Tom Morgan, on'y stupid.

<div class="line_en">All the time he was jerking out these phrases he was stumping up and down the tavern on his crutch, slapping tables with his hand, and giving such a show of excitement as would have convinced an Old Bailey judge or a Bow Street runner. My suspicions had been thoroughly reawakened on finding Black Dog at the Spy -- glass, and I watched the cook narrowly. But he was too deep, and too ready, and too clever for me, and by the time the two men had come back out of breath and confessed that they had lost the track in a crowd, and been scolded like thieves, I would have gone bail for the innocence of Long John Silver.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在他急切地讲这一番话的时候，他一直架着拐杖在小酒馆里跳来跳去，用手拍着桌子，作出一副激动的表情，好像要说服一名伦敦中央刑事法庭的法官或是最高警署的警察一样。在“望远镜”酒店发现“黑狗”这件事，再次唤起了我整个的怀疑。我留心观察着这位厨子，但是他对我来说是太有城府、太有准备、也太聪明了。当那两个人上气不接下气地回来、承认他们在人群中失去了追踪目标时，他们像小偷般地挨了顿训斥，因此，我情愿为高个子约翰·西尔弗的清白作证。">查看中文翻译</div>

Here I have this confounded son of a Dutchman sitting in my own house drinking of my own rum! Here you comes and tells me of it plain; and here I let him give us all the slip before my blessed deadlights! Now, Hawkins, you do me justice with the cap'n. You're a lad, you are, but you're as smart as paint. I see that when you first come in. Now, here it is: What could I do, with this old timber I hobble on? When I was an A B master mariner I'd have come up alongside of him, hand over hand, and broached him to in a brace of old shakes, I would; but now --"</div>
