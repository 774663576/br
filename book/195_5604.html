<div class="line_en">The four weeks of his engagement at Farnley passed quickly. On the cliff a new town was springing up, with red brick villas round golf links, and a large hotel had recently been opened to cater for the summer visitors; but Philip went there seldom. Down below, by the harbour, the little stone houses of a past century were clustered in a delightful confusion, and the narrow streets, climbing down steeply, had an air of antiquity which appealed to the imagination. By the water's edge were neat cottages with trim, tiny gardens in front of them; they were inhabited by retired captains in the merchant service, and by mothers or widows of men who had gained their living by the sea; and they had an appearance which was quaint and peaceful. In the little harbour came tramps from Spain and the Levant, ships of small tonnage; and now and then a windjammer was borne in by the winds of romance. It reminded Philip of the dirty little harbour with its colliers at Blackstable, and he thought that there he had first acquired the desire, which was now an obsession, for Eastern lands and sunlit islands in a tropic sea. But here you felt yourself closer to the wide, deep ocean than on the shore of that North Sea which seemed always circumscribed; here you could draw a long breath as you looked out upon the even vastness; and the west wind, the dear soft salt wind of England, uplifted the heart and at the same time melted it to tenderness.</div>

<div class="line_en">Philip had written to Athelny to tell him that he was doing a locum in Dorsetshire and in due course received an answer from him. It was written in the formal manner he affected, studded with pompous epithets as a Persian diadem was studded with precious stones; and in the beautiful hand, like black letter and as difficult to read, upon which he prided himself. He suggested that Philip should join him and his family in the Kentish hop-field to which he went every year; and to persuade him said various beautiful and complicated things about Philip's soul and the winding tendrils of the hops. Philip replied at once that he would come on the first day he was free. Though not born there, he had a peculiar affection for the Isle of Thanet, and he was fired with enthusiasm at the thought of spending a fortnight so close to the earth and amid conditions which needed only a blue sky to be as idyllic as the olive groves of Arcady.</div>

<div class="line_en">Now the goal seemed very near. He would have finished his appointment at St. Luke's by the middle of the following year, and then he would go to Spain; he could afford to spend several months there, rambling up and down the land which stood to him for romance; after that he would get a ship and go to the East. Life was before him and time of no account. He could wander, for years if he chose, in unfrequented places, amid strange peoples, where life was led in strange ways. He did not know what he sought or what his journeys would bring him; but he had a feeling that he would learn something new about life and gain some clue to the mystery that he had solved only to find more mysterious. And even if he found nothing he would allay the unrest which gnawed at his heart. But Doctor South was showing him a great kindness, and it seemed ungrateful to refuse his offer for no adequate reason; so in his shy way, trying to appear as matter of fact as possible, he made some attempt to explain why it was so important to him to carry out the plans he had cherished so passionately.</div>

<div class="line_en">Doctor South listened quietly, and a gentle look came into his shrewd old eyes. It seemed to Philip an added kindness that he did not press him to accept his offer. Benevolence is often very peremptory. He appeared to look upon Philip's reasons as sound. Dropping the subject, he began to talk of his own youth; he had been in the Royal Navy, and it was his long connection with the sea that, when he retired, had made him settle at Farnley. He told Philip of old days in the Pacific and of wild adventures in China. He had taken part in an expedition against the head-hunters of Borneo and had known Samoa when it was still an independent state. He had touched at coral islands. Philip listened to him entranced. Little by little he told Philip about himself. Doctor South was a widower, his wife had died thirty years before, and his daughter had married a farmer in Rhodesia; he had quarrelled with him, and she had not come to England for ten years. It was just as if he had never had wife or child. He was very lonely. His gruffness was little more than a protection which he wore to hide a complete disillusionment; and to Philip it seemed tragic to see him just waiting for death, not impatiently, but rather with loathing for it, hating old age and unable to resign himself to its limitations, and yet with the feeling that death was the only solution of the bitterness of his life. Philip crossed his path, and the natural affection which long separation from his daughter had killed -- she had taken her husband's part in the quarrel and her children he had never seen -- settled itself upon Philip. At first it made him angry, he told himself it was a sign of dotage; but there was something in Philip that attracted him, and he found himself smiling at him he knew not why. Philip did not bore him. Once or twice he put his hand on his shoulder: it was as near a caress as he had got since his daughter left England so many years before. When the time came for Philip to go Doctor South accompanied him to the station: he found himself unaccountably depressed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="索斯先生安静地听他讲完，那双精明老练的眼睛里泛起一丝温柔的神采。在菲利普看来，索斯医生不强迫自己留下，这就相当于又是另一番好意了。通常情况下，善举总是来得非常专横。他似乎觉得菲利普给出的理由很充分，于是干脆不再强求，聊起自己年轻时候的故事来。他曾经在皇家海军服役，天天漂在海上，所以退役之后决定扎根在法恩利。他跟菲利普讲述了自己在太平洋的航行和在中国的惊险旅程。他曾远征婆罗洲，与那里嗜血成性的魔头英勇决战；他在萨摩亚还没成为德国殖民地之前就曾到过那里；他还曾经踏上过珊瑚岛。菲利普如痴如醉地听他讲着。他把自己的生活也一点点说给菲利普听。索斯医生原来是个鳏夫，妻子三十年前就去世了，唯一的女儿嫁给了罗德西亚的一户农民。他和女婿大闹过一顿，女儿已经有十年没回过英国了。这就像他根本没有过老婆孩子一样。他非常孤独，那暴戾的性格无非是为自己撑起的一把保护伞，用来隐藏尝尽世间滋味后的黯然神伤。他已是风前残烛，却不愿垂垂老去。可他清楚，只有死亡能结果这苦痛的一生。他等待着死神降临，与其说是急不可耐，倒更像在莫名厌恶。菲利普看着他，像是在看一出悲剧。索斯医生的女儿在父亲和丈夫的争执中，站在了后者一方，她的孩子也从没让父亲见过。由于长期与女儿分离，索斯医生似乎已经不会轻易动感情了。而这时菲利普却忽然出现在他的生命里，他把心中尘封多年的情感全都转移到了菲利普身上。最初他也很生气，觉得这是越老越糊涂的表现，可菲利普身上有些东西在吸引着他，让他总喜欢莫名其妙地看着他微笑。菲利普从不让他厌烦。有那么一两次，他把手搭在菲利普的肩膀上，这像是一种爱抚，在女儿多年前离开英国后，他就再也没对其他人这样过了。等到菲利普离开的那天，索斯医生陪他去了车站，胸中有种难以解释的悲伤。">查看中文翻译</div>
