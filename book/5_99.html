<div class="line_en">The words surprised her, though they shouldn't have. In the time they'd been sleeping together, she'd somehow begun to reveal pieces of herself to him. It had begun accidentally, a comment here or there after sex or while they were drinking, and somehow grown from there. She felt safe in his bed, free from judgment or censure. They were lovers who didn't love each other, and that made talking easier. Still, she saw now that he'd listened to all of her babble and let the words form a picture. The knowledge of that made her feel less lonely all of a sudden, and even though it scared her, she couldn't help being comforted by it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这番话让她吃了一惊，但其实一点也不奇怪。他们发生关系以来，她对他说了不少自己的事，一开始只是欢爱过后或一起喝酒时无意中提起，后来却越说越多。在他的床上她觉得很安心，不必担心批评或责备。他们是性伴侣，彼此并不相爱，这样说起话来反而更轻松。不过，现在她发现原来她随口说的话他都听进去了，并借此组合出整体，这件事让她忽然觉得不那么孤单了，即使觉得害怕，她依然不由自主地感到安慰。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">More importantly, he'd shown her what making love was. His bed had become her port; his arms her life ring. When she kissed him and let him touch her with an unimaginable intimacy, she forgot that she didn't believe in love. Her first time, back in those dark Snohomish woods, faded from her memory a little more each day, until one day she discovered that she no longer carried it around inside of her.

By fall semester of her senior year, she was growing impatient with the rarefied world of college. CNN had changed the face of broadcasting. Out in the real world, things were happening, things that mattered. John Lennon had been shot and killed outside his New York apartment; a guy named Hinckley had shot President Reagan in a pathetic attempt to impress Jodie Foster; Sandra Day O'Conner had become the first female Supreme Court justice; and Diana Spencer had married Prince Charles in a ceremony so fairy-tale perfect that every girl in America believed in love and happy endings for the entire summer.

In the glam early eighties, you couldn't wear too much makeup or have too big a hairdo. "You've made me ready and we both know it. You got me to change my hair to this boring Jane Pauley bob. Every suit I own is black and my shoes look like a suburban housewife's."

Empathetic but professional. She couldn't quite pull it off and she and Chad both knew it. "I'm not talking about the networks yet. It's just one interview for a part-time job until graduation." She walked over to the bed. In her black suit and white blouse, she was the picture of conservative chic. She'd even tamed the sexiness of her shoulder-length hair by pulling it back into a banana clip. Sitting on the edge of the mattress, she pushed a long lock of hair away from his eyes.

<div class="line_en">If only she really had a dream of her own, something to replace the twin-TV news stars. Tully might accept that; Kate's vague, I don't know, wouldn't hold much water with Tropical Storm Tully.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="假使她有真正的目标，或许可以取代搭档成为王牌记者的梦想，塔莉也比较可能接受；如果凯蒂只是含糊地说她不知道，恐怕无法抵挡热带风暴塔莉的威力。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She simply had to stand up to Tully, for once, and tell her the truth, say, Those are your dreams, Tully, and I'm proud of you, but I'm not fourteen anymore and I can't follow you forever.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她只要坚持立场一次就好，告诉塔莉实话：那些是你的梦想，塔莉，你让我感到光荣，但我已经不是十四岁的小女生了，不可能永远跟随你。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Maybe today," she said aloud, dragging her backpack along beside her as she walked through the gray, foggy campus.</div>

<div class="line_en">About thirty people shushed her as the General Hospital theme music started. Laura's face filled the screen. She looked beautiful and dewy-eyed in a gorgeous white headdress. A collective sigh went around the room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="大约有三十个人同时出声嘘她，因为日间医学影集《杏林春暖》的主题曲响起了。屏幕出现女主角劳拉的特写，她好漂亮，眼睛水汪汪，披着无比美丽的白纱，客厅里的所有人不约而同地出声赞叹。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On the edge of campus, she merged into the stream of kids and crossed the street, smiling and waving at friends as she passed them. At the sorority house, she went right to the living room, where girls sat packed like hot dogs on the sofas and chairs and on every patch of the celery-green carpet.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到了校园外围，她和其他学生一起过马路，遇到朋友时微笑挥手打招呼；回到姐妹会所，她直接去客厅，一大群女生像热狗一样排排坐在沙发和椅子上，芹绿色地毯上也坐满了人。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="就在这时候，会所的门砰一声打开。“凯蒂！”塔莉嚷嚷着走进客厅。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As soon as it was over and the music started up again, she popped to her feet. "Come on, Katie. We need to talk." She grabbed Kate's hand and led her away from the publicness of the TV room, through the halls, and down a flight of stairs to the sorority's dirty little secret: the smoking lounge. It was a tiny room, tucked behind the kitchen, with two love seats, a coffee table littered with full ashtrays, and air so thick and blue it hurt your eyes, even when no one was in the room. It was the place for after-party gossip and late-night laughter.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="戏一演完，主题曲再次响起，塔莉立刻站起身，“快来，凯蒂，我有话跟你说。”她牵起凯蒂的手拉她离开挤满人的客厅，穿过走廊前往地下室，这里藏着姐妹会见不得光的小秘密：吸烟室。这是个藏在厨房后面的小房间，有两张双人沙发，茶几上摆着好几个已满的烟灰缸，空气非常差，即使没有人在里面抽烟一样烟雾缭绕，一进去眼睛会刺痛。这里是派对结束后聊八卦的圣地，半夜想聊天说笑也很适合来这里。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Don't be ridiculous. You still want to be a team, don't you?" Tully paused, stared at Kate, who screwed up her courage and opened her mouth. Then Tully laughed. "Of course you do. I knew it. You were just messing with me. Very funny. I'll talk to Mr. Ryan -- he's my new boss -- just as soon as he can't live without me. Now I gotta run. Chad will want to hear about the interview, but I had to tell you first." Tully hugged her fiercely and left.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“说什么傻话，你该不会不想做我的搭档了吧？”塔莉停顿，望着凯蒂，凯蒂努力挤出勇气张口，但就在这时塔莉大笑起来，“当然不可能，我知道的啦，你只是跟我闹着玩，真幽默。我的新老板是雷恩先生，等他没有我不行的时候，我就会跟他说。我得走了，查德绝对很想知道面试结果，不过我一定要先告诉你。”塔莉用力抱她一下之后就离开了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Tully grinned. "I did. Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. Some weekends. We're on our way, Katie. I'll nail this job and by the time we graduate, I'll talk them into hiring you. We'll be a team, just like we always said."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="塔莉的笑容很得意，“没错，每星期一、三、五上班，有时候周末也要去。凯蒂，我们踏出第一步了。一毕业我就会抢到那里的工作机会，然后说服他们雇用你，我们能像以前说好的那样成为好搭档。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Kate hated it down here. The habit that had seemed so cool and defiant at thirteen was gross and stupid now. "So, tell me everything. You got the internship, right?"</div>
