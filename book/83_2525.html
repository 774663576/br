<div class="line_en">The raincoat was open in front and I couldn't button it, being handcuffed. The skirts flapped against my legs like the wings of a large and tired bird. I came to the highway. Cars went by in a wide swirl of water illuminated by headlights. The tearing noise of their tires died swiftly. I found my convertible where I had left it, both tires fixed and mounted, so it could be driven away, if necessary. They thought of everything. I got into it and leaned down sideways under the wheel and fumbled aside the flap of leather that covered the pocket. I got the other gun, stuffed it up under my coat and started back. The world was small, shut in, black. A private world for Canino and me.</div>

<div class="line_en">The garage next door was dark. I crossed the gravel drive and a patch of sodden lawn. The road ran with small rivulets of water. It gurgled down a ditch on the far side. I had no hat. That must have fallen in the garage. Canino hadn't bothered to give it back to me. He hadn't thought I would need it any more. I imagined him driving back jauntily through the rain, alone, having left the gaunt and sulky Art and the probably stolen sedan in a safe place. She loved Eddie Mars and she was hiding to protect him. So he would find her there when he came back, calm beside the light and the untasted drink, and me tied up on the davenport. He would carry her stuff out to the car and go through the house carefully to make sure nothing incriminating was left. He would tell her to go out and wait. She wouldn't hear a shot. A blackjack is just as effective at short range. He would tell her he had left me tied up and I would get loose after a while. He would think she was that dumb. Nice Mr. Canino.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="隔壁的修车厂里漆黑一片。我穿过砾石车道和一片湿漉漉的草坪。路面上流着一道道细水，汩汩地淌进道路另一边的壕沟里。帽子不见了。肯定掉在修车厂里了。卡尼诺懒得把帽子还给我。他没想到我还会用得着。我想象着他兴高采烈在雨中驾车独自归来的样子——消瘦、阴郁的阿尔特，很可能还有那辆偷来的车都被他留在了安全的地方。她爱着艾迪·马尔斯，为了保护他而躲了起来。所以，等他回来时会发现她在屋里，身旁是台灯和没有喝过的酒，而我被绑在长沙发上。他会把她的细软搬上车，仔细检查一番屋子，确保没有落下任何罪证。他会叫她出去等。她不会听到枪响。近距离作战，用一根包革铁棒照样管用。他会跟她说，就让我绑着，过会儿我会自己挣脱的。他以为她是傻子。好一个卡尼诺先生。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I came back to the soggy grass plot and sloshed across it. The car was between me and the house, the gun was down at my side, pulled as far around as I could get it, without pulling my left arm out by the roots. The car was dark, empty, warm. Water gurgled pleasantly in the radiator. I peered in at the door. The keys hung on the dash. Canino was very sure of himself. I went around the car and walked carefully across the gravel to the window and listened. I couldn't hear any voices, any sound but the swift bong-bong of the raindrops hitting the metal elbows at the bottom of the rain gutters.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我回到湿润的草地，踩着水走了过去。车隔在我和房子之间，枪在我身侧，恰好是我右手绕过来可以够到最远的位置，再用力一点我的左手就要被扯断了。车里黑漆漆、空荡荡，很暖和。雨水在散热器上汩汩淌着。我站在车门前朝里面眯眼看了看。钥匙插在仪表盘上。卡尼诺相当自信。我绕到车身另一边，轻手轻脚地闯过砾石道，走到窗前细听。听不到任何人说话，只有雨滴打在排水沟底部的金属弯道上发出的急促的当当声。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Halfway there the headlights nearly caught me. They turned swiftly off the highway and I slid down the bank into the wet ditch and flopped there breathing water. The car hummed by without slowing. I lifted my head, heard the rasp of its tires as it left the road and took the gravel of the driveway. The motor died, the lights died, a door slammed. I didn't hear the house door shut, but a fringe of light trickled through the clump of trees, as though a shade had been moved aside from a window, or the light had been put on in the hall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="走到半路，两道车头灯光差点照到我。灯光很快移开了路面，我滑下陡坡，扑通一声跌进了湿漉漉的壕沟里，吃了好几口脏水。那辆车轰鸣着驶过，并未减速。我抬起头，听到车胎离开路边转上那条砾石车道时发出的刮擦声。马达歇了，车灯熄了，车门砰地关上了。我没听到房门关上的声音，但树丛间流泻出了一束束纤细的光亮，像是窗前拉开了帘子，或者过道里点上了灯。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I straightened up and got into the car backwards, fumbled around for the ignition key and turned it. I reached with my foot, but the starter button had to be on the dash. I found it at last, pulled it and the starter ground. The warm motor caught at once. It purred softly, contentedly. I got out of the car again and crouched down by the rear wheels.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我直起身子，倒退着钻进车里，四下摸索着转动了车钥匙。我伸脚去够，可起动开关肯定是在仪表盘上。我终于找到了开关，一拉，车发动了。尚有余温的引擎起动了。它轻轻地，心满意足地隆隆响起来。我回到车外，蹲在后轮旁边。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I couldn't do it. I shifted the gun to my left hand and leaned down to scoop up a handful of gravel. I tossed it against the screen of the window. It was a feeble effort. Very little of it reached the glass above the screen, but the loose rattle of that little was like a dam bursting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="可我等不及了。我把枪换到左手，俯身抄起一把石子，朝纱窗上扔过去。这一下扔得绵软无力。只有几粒碰到了纱窗上方的玻璃，但那零星细琐的撞击声已然犹如大坝决堤。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I kept on listening. No loud voices, everything quiet and refined. He would be purring at her and she would be telling him she had let me go and I had promised to let them get away. He wouldn't believe me, as I wouldn't believe him. So he wouldn't be in there long. He would be on his way and take her with him. All I had to do was wait for him to come out.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我继续听着。没有响亮的说话声，一切都安静而优雅。他应该正“嗡嗡”对她说话，她则告诉他，她把我放走了，我保证过不会再来追查。他不会相信我的话，正如我不会相信他的话。所以他不会在那儿待上太久。他会带着她上路。我只需等他出来就行了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I ran back to the car and got on the running board behind it. The house had already gone dark. That was all. I dropped quietly on the running board and waited. No soap. Canino was too cagey.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我奔回车那边，迈上车后的踏板。这时屋里的灯已经熄了。成功了。我静静蹲伏在踏板上，等待着。还是不行。卡尼诺太狡猾了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I was shivering now but I knew Canino wouldn't like that last effect. He needed that car badly. A darkened window slid down inch by inch, only some shifting of light on the glass showing it moved. Flame spouted from it abruptly, the blended roar of three swift shots. Glass starred in the coupe. I yelled with agony. The yell went off into a wailing groan. The groan became a wet gurgle, choked with blood. I let the gurgle die sickeningly, one choked gasp. It was nice work. I liked it. Canino liked it very much. I heard him laugh. It was a large booming laugh, not at all like the purr of his speaking voice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我浑身发抖，但我知道这最后一招定会激怒卡尼诺。他非常需要这辆车。一扇漆黑的窗户一英寸一英寸拉下来，若非玻璃上的些许光线变化，我都不知道窗在动。突然窗里碰出火星，呼啸着传来三声前后相连的急促枪响。车玻璃裂开了花。我痛苦地尖叫起来。接着尖叫转为哀嚎。哀嚎过后是液体流淌的汩汩声，涌动的鲜血令我窒息。演得很逼真。我相当满意。卡尼诺也相当满意。我听到他在笑。他的笑响亮而震撼，一点不像他说话时的瓮声瓮气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then silence for a little while, except for the rain and the quietly throbbing motor of the car. Then the house door crawled open, a deeper blackness in the black night. A figure showed in it cautiously, something white around the neck. It was her collar. She came out on the porch stiffly, a wooden woman. I caught the pale shine of her silver wig. Canino came crouched methodically behind her. It was so deadly it was almost funny.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接着是短暂的沉寂，只剩下雨声和轻轻响着的引擎。随后屋门悄然打开了，黑夜里就此多了一块更黑的区域。一个人影警惕地出现在门洞里，脖子里绕着一圈白的东西。是她的领子。她僵着身子走到门廊里，像一个木头人。我瞥见了她银色假发上的惨白亮光。卡尼诺有条不紊地在她身后半蹲着前行。煞有介事得简直好笑。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He grunted something and the girl's body jerked hard, as though he had jammed a gun into her back. She came on again and drew near the lightless car. I could see him behind her now, his hat, a side of his face, the bulk of his shoulder. The girl stopped rigid and screamed. A beautiful thin tearing scream that rocked me like a left hook.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他咕哝了两声，那姑娘的身体猝然一动，像是他用枪猛推了一下她的后背。她再次上前来，走近那辆没有亮灯的车。我看到他站在她身后，看到他的帽子，他的侧脸，他壮硕的肩膀。那姑娘身子一挺，尖叫起来。那声撕心裂肺的凄美叫声像一记左勾拳般震撼了我。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She came down the steps. Now I could see the white stiffness of her face. She started towards the car. A bulwark of defense for Canino, in case I could still spit in his eye. Her voice spoke through the lisp of the rain, saying slowly, without any tone: "I can't see a thing, Lash. The windows are misted."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她走下台阶。现在我能看到她苍白僵硬的脸庞了。她朝车子走来。他拿她当防御壁垒，生怕我还能朝他眼睛上吐唾沫。她的声音透过潺潺的雨声，语气极其平板地缓缓说道：“我什么也看不见，拉什。车窗上都是雾气。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I can see him!" she screamed. "Through the window. Behind the wheel, Lash!"</div>

<div class="line_en">He fell for it like a bucket of lead. He knocked her roughly to one side and jumped forward, throwing his hand up. Three more spurts of flame cut the darkness. More glass scarred. One bullet went on through and smacked into a tree on my side. A ricochet whined off into the distance. But the motor went quietly on.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他像只铅筒似的掉进了陷阱里。他粗暴地把她推到一旁，一跃而上，急切地抬起手来。又是三道火光划破黑暗。玻璃又碎了一些。一颗子弹穿了过去，射在我身旁的一棵树上。一块碎片嗖地飞到了远处。可引擎还是静静地转动着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He was low down, crouched against the gloom, his face a grayness without form that seemed to come back slowly after the glare of the shots. If it was a revolver he had, it might be empty. It might not. He had fired six times, but he might have reloaded inside the house. I hoped he had. I didn't want him with an empty gun. But it might be an automatic.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他身子压得很低，蹲在暗处，他的脸是一团模糊的灰色，仿佛是在那三道子弹的火光过后缓缓重现原形的。如果他拿的是一把左轮手枪，子弹可能已经打完了。也可能并没有。他开了六枪，但出门前或许重新装过弹。但愿如此。我不想他拿的是一把空枪。不过那也可能是一把自动手枪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I said: "Finished?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我说：“完了？”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He whirled at me. Perhaps it would have been nice to allow him another shot or two, just like a gentleman of the old school. But his gun was still up and I couldn't wait any longer. Not long enough to be a gentleman of the old school. I shot him four times, the Colt straining against my ribs. The gun jumped out of his hand as if it had been kicked. He reached both his hands for his stomach. I could hear them smack hard against his body. He fell like that, straight forward, holding himself together with his broad hands. He fell face down in the wet gravel. And after that there wasn't a sound from him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他猛地转过身来。也许正派的做法是让他再开一两枪，就像老派的绅士一样。但他还举着枪，我等不及了。没时间当老派的绅士了。我朝他开了四枪，那把柯尔特勒得我肋骨疼。枪从他手里蹦了出来，仿佛被人踢了一脚。他伸出双手捂住肚子。我能听到他的手重重地拍打在身上。他就这样笔直向前倒去，两只宽大的手紧紧抓着自己。他脸朝下倒在潮湿的砾石路上。他就此再也不做声了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Silver-Wig didn't make a sound either. She stood rigid, with the rain swirling at her. I walked around Canino and kicked his gun, without any purpose. Then I walked after it and bent over sideways and picked it up. That put me close beside her. She spoke moodily, as if she was talking to herself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="银发套姑娘也不做声。她僵直地站着，任凭纷乱的雨点落到身上。我绕到车的另一边，鬼使神差地踢开了他的枪。随后我追上去，侧着身下腰把枪捡起来。这样一来，我跟她靠得很近了。她闷闷不乐地说着话，仿佛是在自言自语。">查看中文翻译</div>
