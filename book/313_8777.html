"If you consider how much creosote is carted about London in one day, it is no great wonder that our trail should have been crossed. It is much used now, especially for the seasoning of wood. Poor Toby is not to blame."</div>

Toby led us to the very edge of this and there stood whining, looking out on the dark current beyond.</div>

<div class="line_en">Close to the rude landing-stage was a small brick house, with a wooden placard slung out through the second window. "Mordecai Smith" was printed across it in large letters, and, underneath, "Boats to hire by the hour or day." A second inscription above the door informed us that a steam launch was kept -- a statement which was confirmed by a great pile of coke upon the jetty. Sherlock Holmes looked slowly round, and his face assumed an ominous expression.</div>

<div class="line_en">It was between eight and nine o'clock now, and I was conscious of a strong reaction after the successive excitements of the night. I was limp and weary, befogged in mind and fatigued in body. I had not the professional enthusiasm which carried my companion on, nor could I look at the matter as a mere abstract intellectual problem. As far as the death of Bartholomew Sholto went, I had heard little good of him and could feel no intense antipathy to his murderers. The treasure, however, was a different matter. That, or part of it, belonged rightfully to Miss Morstan. While there was a chance of recovering it I was ready to devote my life to the one object. True, if I found it, it would probably put her forever beyond my reach. Yet it would be a petty and selfish love which would be influenced by such a thought as that. If Holmes could work to find the criminals, I had a tenfold stronger reason to urge me on to find the treasure.</div>

<div class="line_en">About twelve o'clock last night [said the Standard ] Mr. Bartholomew Sholto, of Pondicherry Lodge, Upper Norwood, was found dead in his room under circumstances which point to foul play. As far as we can learn, no actual traces of violence were found upon Mr. Sholto's person, but a valuable collection of Indian gems which the deceased gentleman had inherited from his father has been carried off. The discovery was first made by Mr. Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, who had called at the house with Mr. Thaddeus Sholto, brother of the deceased. By a singular piece of good fortune, Mr. Athelney Jones, the well-known member of the detective police force, happened to be at the Norwood police station and was on the ground within half an hour of the first alarm. His trained and experienced faculties were at once directed towards the detection of the criminals, with the gratifying result that the brother, Thaddeus Sholto, has already been arrested, together with the housekeeper, Mrs. Bernstone, an Indian butler named Lal Rao, and a porter, or gatekeeper, named McMurdo.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这份《旗帜报》写道：昨晚十二点左右，上诺伍德区本地治里别墅的主人巴塞洛缪·肖尔托先生在自己的房间内死亡，显然是被暗杀的。根据我们所知道的情况，现场没有明显打斗的痕迹，可死者从他父亲那里继承的一批贵重印度宝物已经失窃。死者的弟弟塞迪厄斯·肖尔托先生与一同前去拜访的舍洛克·福尔摩斯先生以及沃森医生首先发现了命案。幸运的是，这时候，名侦探阿塞尔纳·琼斯先生正在诺伍德警察分局，因此可以在命案发现半个小时内赶到现场，主持大局。他训练有素，经验丰富，到场后立刻运用自身才能，寻找凶手，可喜的结果是，死者其弟塞迪厄斯·肖尔托已被逮捕，同时被逮捕的还有女管家伯恩斯通太太、印度仆人拉尔·拉奥和守门人麦克默多。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It is quite certain that the thief or thieves were well acquainted with the house, for Mr. Jones's well-known technical knowledge and his powers of minute observation have enabled him to prove conclusively that the miscreants could not have entered by the door or by the window but must have made their way across the roof of the building, and so through a trapdoor into a room which communicated with that in which the body was found. This fact, which has been very clearly made out, proves conclusively that it was no mere haphazard burglary. The prompt and energetic action of the officers of the law shows the great advantage of the presence on such occasions of a single vigorous and masterful mind. We cannot but think that it supplies an argument to those who would wish to see our detectives more decentralized, and so brought into closer and more effective touch with the cases which it is their duty to investigate.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="很明显，这名或这些凶手对这所房子十分熟悉。因为，凭借其闻名遐迩的专业知识和缜密的观察能力，琼斯先生最终证明，凶手不是从窗或门潜入室内，而是经由房顶。凶手是通过一扇暗门进入了一个房间，而这个房间能通向尸体被发现的房间。由这个明显的事实可以推出结论：这并非普通的盗窃案。执法者们的迅速反应说明，在这样的情况下，有一位老练的警官在场是很有利的。同时我们认为，此次事件进一步说明，让全市警探分散驻守的政策，能使他们更紧密、更有效率地接触到他们有责任侦查的案件。">查看中文翻译</div>
