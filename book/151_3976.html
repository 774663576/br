<div class="line_en">"So, Auggie Doggie," he said, "it was really an okay day?" He got that from an old cartoon about a dachshund named Auggie Doggie, by the way. He had bought it for me on eBay when I was about four, and we watched it a lot for a while -- especially in the hospital. He would call me Auggie Doggie and I would call him "dear ol' Dad," like the puppy called the dachshund dad on the show.</div>

<div class="line_en">"That took you years to grow!" she said, almost like she was angry. "Why did you cut it off?"</div>

<div class="line_en">"That was the deal, yes," he answered. "Though I guess it would depend on why you wanted to stop going, too, you know. You'd have to let us know. You'd have to talk to us and tell us how you're feeling, and if anything bad was happening. Okay? You promise you'd tell us?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“是的，我们有言在先，”他答道，“不过我想，这取决于你为什么想辍学，你懂的。你得让我们知道。你必须跟我们聊一聊，告诉我们你的感受，是不是发生了什么不愉快的事。好吗？你保证会跟我们说的吧？”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As soon as he closed the door, Mom pulled out the book she'd been reading to me for the last couple of weeks. I was relieved because I really was afraid she'd want to "talk," and I just didn't feel like doing that. But Mom didn't seem to want to talk, either. She just flipped through the pages until she got to where we had left off. We were about halfway through The Hobbit.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="等他关上门，妈妈抽出了最近几个星期以来她一直在为我读的书。我松了一口气，因为我真的害怕她跟我“谈话”，我就是不想谈话。不过，妈妈看起来也没有想谈话的意思。她只是翻开书，找到我们上次停下来的地方。《霍比特人》我们已经读到一半了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"They were a gloomy party that night, and the gloom gathered still deeper on them in the following days. They had crossed the enchanted stream; but beyond it the path seemed to straggle on just as before, and in the forest they could see no change."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“那天晚上，一行人的士气十分低落，稍后几天他们的心情更是跌到了谷底。他们已经越过了魔法的溪流，但溪流之后的小径似乎还是同样的蜿蜒曲折，森林也没有任何改变。”">查看中文翻译</div>
