<div class="line_en">I wrote the story when I was at home, the autumn after I had learned to speak. We had stayed up at Fern Quarry later than usual. While we were there, Miss Sullivan had described to me the beauties of the late foliage, and it seems that her descriptions revived the memory of a story, which must have been read to me, and which I must have unconsciously retained. I thought then that I was "making up a story," as children say, and I eagerly sat down to write it before the ideas should slip from me. My thoughts flowed easily; I felt a sense of joy in the composition. Words and images came tripping to my finger ends, and as I thought out sentence after sentence, I wrote them on my braille slate. Now, if words and images come to me without effort, it is a pretty sure sign that they are not the offspring of my own mind, but stray waifs that I regretfully dismiss. At that time I eagerly absorbed everything I read without a thought of authorship, and even now I cannot be quite sure of the boundary line between my ideas and those I find in books. I suppose that is because so many of my impressions come to me through the medium of others' eyes and ears.</div>

<div class="line_en">The winter of 1892 was darkened by the one cloud in my childhood's bright sky. Joy deserted my heart, and for a long, long time I lived in doubt, anxiety and fear. Books lost their charm for me, and even now the thought of those dreadful days chills my heart. A little story called'The Frost King," which I wrote and sent to Mr. Anagnos, of the Perkins Institution for the Blind, was at the root of the trouble. In order to make the matter clear, I must set forth the facts connected with this episode, which justice to my teacher and to myself compels me to relate.</div>

<div class="line_en">Accordingly I copied the story and sent it to him for his birthday. It was suggested that I should change the title from "Autumn Leaves" to "The Frost King," which I did. I carried the little story to the post-office myself, feeling as if I were walking on air. I little dreamed how cruelly I should pay for that birthday gift.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr. Anagnos was delighted with "The Frost King," and published it in one of the Perkins Institution reports. This was the pinnacle of my happiness, from which I was in a little while dashed to earth. I had been in Boston only a short time when it was discovered that a story similar to "The Frost King," called "The Frost Fairies" by Miss Margaret T. Canby, had appeared before I was born in a book called "Birdie and His Friends." The two stories were so much alike in thought and language that it was evident Miss Canby's story had been read to me, and that mine was -- a plagiarism. It was difficult to make me understand this; but when I did understand I was astonished and grieved. No child ever drank deeper of the cup of bitterness than I did. I had disgraced myself; I had brought suspicion upon those I loved best. And yet how could it possibly have happened? I racked my brain until I was weary to recall anything about the frost that I had read before I wrote "The Frost King"; but I could remember nothing, except the common reference to Jack Frost, and a poem for children, "The Freaks of the Frost," and I knew I had not used that in my composition.</div>

<div class="line_en">The night before the celebration, one of the teachers of the Institution had asked me a question connected with "The Frost King," and I was telling her that Miss Sullivan had talked to me about Jack Frost and his wonderful works. Something I said made her think she detected in my words a confession that I did remember Miss Canby's story of "The Frost Fairies," and she laid her conclusions before Mr. Anagnos, although I had told her most emphatically that she was mistaken.</div>

<div class="line_en">Mr. Anagnos, who loved me tenderly, thinking that he had been deceived, turned a deaf ear to the pleadings of love and innocence. He believed, or at least suspected, that Miss Sullivan and I had deliberately stolen the bright thoughts of another and imposed them on him to win his admiration. I was brought before a court of investigation composed of the teachers and officers of the Institution, and Miss Sullivan was asked to leave me. Then I was questioned and cross-questioned with what seemed to me a determination on the part of my judges to force me to acknowledge that I remembered having had "The Frost Fairies" read to me. I felt in every question the doubt and suspicion that was in their minds, and I felt, too, that a loved friend was looking at me reproachfully, although I could not have put all this into words. The blood pressed about my thumping heart, and I could scarcely speak, except in monosyllables. Even the consciousness that it was only a dreadful mistake did not lessen my suffering, and when at last I was allowed to leave the room, I was dazed and did not notice my teacher's caresses, or the tender words of my friends, who said I was a brave little girl and they were proud of me.</div>

<div class="line_en">Miss Sullivan had never heard of "The Frost Fairies" or of the book in which it was published. With the assistance of Dr. Alexander Graham Bell, she investigated the matter carefully, and at last it came out that Mrs. Sophia C. Hopkins had a copy of Miss Canby's "Birdie and His Friends'in 1888, the year that we spent the summer with her at Brewster. Mrs. Hopkins was unable to find her copy; but she has told me that at that time, while Miss Sullivan was away on a vacation, she tried to amuse me by reading from various books, and although she could not remember reading'The Frost Fairies" any more than I, yet she felt sure that "Birdie and His Friends" was one of them. She explained the disappearance of the book by the fact that she had a short time before sold her house and disposed of many juvenile books, such as old schoolbooks and fairy tales, and that'Birdie and His Friends" was probably among them.</div>

<div class="line_en">When Miss Sullivan came back, I did not speak to her about "The Frost Fairies," probably because she began at once to read "Little Lord Fauntleroy," which filled my mind to the exclusion of everything else.

<div class="line_en">I have read "The Frost Fairies" since, also the letters I wrote in which I used other ideas of Miss Canby's. I find in one of them, a letter to Mr. Anagnos, dated September 29, 1891, words and sentiments exactly like those of the book. At the time I was writing "The Frost King," and this letter, like many others, contains phrases which show that my mind was saturated with the story. I represent my teacher as saying to me of the golden autumn leaves, "Yes, they are beautiful enough to comfort us for the flight of summer"-- an idea direct from Miss Canby's story.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我后来读过《霜仙》，也读过当时写的借鉴了坎比小姐其他想法的一些信。我发现，其中有一封标明1891年9月29日给阿纳格诺斯先生的信中，措辞和感情与坎比小姐书中内容完全雷同。当时，我正在写《霜王》，这封信像很多别的信一样，其中包含的语句说明，我的头脑中浸透了那个故事。我假想自己是沙利文老师，向自己描述金黄色的秋叶：“是的，唯有美丽的叶子才能寄托我对流逝夏日的眷恋。”而坎比小姐的故事中有同样的思想。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Miss Canby herself wrote kindly, "Someday you will write a great story out of your own head, that will be a comfort and help to many."But this kind prophecy has never been fulfilled. I have never played with words again for the mere pleasure of the game. Indeed, I have ever since been tortured by the fear that what I write is not my own. For a long time, when I wrote a letter, even to my mother, I was seized with a sudden feeling of terror, and I would spell the sentences over and over, to make sure that I had not read them in a book. Had it not been for the persistent encouragement of Miss Sullivan, I think I should have given up trying to write altogether.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="坎比小姐充满爱意地亲自写道：“将来总有一天，你会写出自己的巨著，使许多人从中得到慰藉和帮助。”不过，这种预言到现在都没有实现。我不再仅仅为了消遣而去舞文弄墨。事实上，打那以后，我总是提心吊胆，害怕写出来的东西不是自己想出来的。有很长一段时间，即便是给妈妈写信，我也会感到惴惴不安，我一遍遍地反复念每一个句子，直到确信自己并没有在某本书中读到过这些话。如果没有沙利文小姐坚持不懈的鼓励，我想自己这辈子恐怕都不会再去碰纸和笔了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Those early compositions were mental gymnastics. I was learning, as all young and inexperienced persons learn, by assimilation and imitation, to put ideas into words. Everything I found in books that pleased me I retained in my memory, consciously or unconsciously, and adapted it. The young writer, as Stevenson has said, instinctively tries to copy whatever seems most admirable, and he shifts his admiration with astonishing versatility. It is only after years of this sort of practice that even great men have learned to marshal the legion of words which come thronging through every byway of the mind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那些早期作文是智力训练。和所有缺乏经验的年轻人一样，我通过汲取和模仿，逐渐学会用文字表达思想。凡是书中能引起我兴趣的东西，都被我自觉或不自觉地记下来，并转化为自己的东西。正如史蒂文森[12]所说，初学写作的人本能地模仿自己最钦慕的作品，并将钦慕转化为千变万化的文字。即使是伟大的作家，也只有在经年累月的训练后，才能学会驾御那些通过各种渠道蜂拥而至的文字。【注：[12]指罗伯特·刘易斯·史蒂文森（Robert Louis Stevenson，1850—1894），苏格兰小说家、诗人与散文家，代表作有《金银岛》等。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This habit of assimilating what pleased me and giving it out again as my own appears in much of my early correspondence and my first attempts at writing. In a composition which I wrote about the old cities of Greece and Italy, I borrowed my glowing descriptions, with variations, from sources I have forgotten. I knew Mr. Anagnos' great love of antiquity and his enthusiastic appreciation of all beautiful sentiments about Italy and Greece. I therefore gathered from all the books I read every bit of poetry or of history that I thought would give him pleasure. Mr. Anagnos, in speaking of my composition on the cities, has said, "These ideas are poetic in their essence." But I do not understand how he ever thought a blind and deaf child of eleven could have invented them. Yet I cannot think that because I did not originate the ideas, my little composition is therefore quite devoid of interest. It shows me that I could express my appreciation of beautiful and poetic ideas in clear and animated language.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="吸收喜欢的东西并转化成自己的思想表达出来的这种习惯，在我早期许多书信和写作中常常能看到。在一篇描写希腊和意大利古城的文章中，我极尽渲染铺张之能事，词语都是借来的，而来源都已忘却。我知道阿纳格诺斯先生喜欢古迹，对古希腊和意大利文明更是情有独钟、推崇备至。于是，我从自己读的书中收集了所有我认为会使他高兴的诗歌和历史。阿纳格诺斯先生在评论我有关古城的文章时说：“这些想法本质上饶有诗意。”但我并不明白，他怎么会相信一个十一岁的盲聋女孩能写出这样的作品。不过，我也曾认为，不能因为我那篇小作文中有别人的思想，就认为它索然无趣。它表明，我能够用形象生动的语言来表达自己对美好而富含诗意的思想的欣赏。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I am afraid I have not yet completed this process. It is certain that I cannot always distinguish my own thoughts from those I read, because what I read becomes the very substance and texture of my mind. Consequently, in nearly all that I write, I produce something which very much resembles the crazy patchwork I used to make when I first learned to sew. This patchwork was made of all sorts of odds and ends -- pretty bits of silk and velvet; but the coarse pieces that were not pleasant to touch always predominated. Likewise my compositions are made up of crude notions of my own, inlaid with the brighter thoughts and riper opinions of the authors I have read. It seems to me that the great difficulty of writing is to make the language of the educated mind express our confused ideas, half feelings, half thoughts, when we are little more than bundles of instinctive tendencies. Trying to write is very much like trying to put a Chinese puzzle together. We have a pattern in mind which we wish to work out in words; but the words will not fit the spaces, or, if they do, they will not match the design. But we keep on trying because we know that others have succeeded, and we are not willing to acknowledge defeat.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我恐怕至今也没有完成这一过程。我确实常常无法辨别哪些思想是自己的，哪些思想是从书中获得的，因为书里的思想已经变成了我的精神实质，和我融为一体。结果，我写的几乎所有作品都好像自己初学缝纫时用七零八碎的布片拼成的杂色拼接物，其中不乏精美的丝绸和天鹅绒，但也有粗布头。而且，粗布头占绝大部分，十分显眼。同样，我的文章虽说反映了我的一些粗鄙见解，但其间也夹杂着我读过的别人的真知灼见和成熟观点。在我看来，写作的最大困难在于，当自己思绪混乱、半是感觉半是思索、只有一堆直觉的时候，如何用学到的语言理性地表达。写作就像拼七巧板，先在脑海中勾勒出一幅图案，然后用文字把它描绘出来。但有时却词不达意，或者是词语很恰当，但组合出来的文字却与原来的构思相距甚远。尽管如此，我们还是锲而不舍地努力尝试，因为我们知道，既然别人能行，我们怎么能认输呢？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Since the publication of "The Story of My Life" in the Ladies' Home Journal, Mr. Anagnos has made a statement, in a letter to Mr. Macy, that at the time of the "Frost King" matter, he believed I was innocent.

Four of them, he says, thought I knew that Miss Canby's story had been read to me, and the others did not hold this view.

<div class="line_cn" title="我在《妇女之家》杂志上发表了《我生命的故事》之后，阿纳格诺斯先生在给梅西先生的一封信中表示，在《霜王》事件中，他相信我是无辜的。他说当时的调查组由八名成员组成，四名盲人，四名正常人，其中四人认为我知道有人给我读过坎比小姐的那篇故事，而另外四人则相反。作为调查组的一员，阿纳格诺斯先生当时投了我一票。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"There is no way to become original, except to be born so," says Stevenson, and although I may not be original, I hope sometime to outgrow my artificial, periwigged compositions. Then, perhaps, my own thoughts and experiences will come to the surface. Meanwhile I trust and hope and persevere, and try not to let the bitter memory of "The Frost King" trammel my efforts.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="史蒂文森说：“人若生来无创造才能，便注定不可能创新。”我也许就是这样的人。不过，我还是希望有朝一日能写出真实而自然的文章，那样的话，就可以把自己的思想和经历表现出来。同时，我相信自己，充满希望，并坚持不懈，也设法不让《霜王》事件的痛苦记忆阻碍我的写作。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But, however the case may have been, with whichever side he may have cast his vote, when I went into the room where Mr. Anagnos had so often held me on his knee and, forgetting his many cares, had shared in my frolics, and found there persons who seemed to doubt me, I felt that there was something hostile and menacing in the very atmosphere, and subsequent events have borne out this impression. For two years he seems to have held the belief that Miss Sullivan and I were innocent. Then he evidently retracted his favourable judgment, why I do not know. Nor did I know the details of the investigation. I never knew even the names of the members of the "court" who did not speak to me. I was too excited to notice anything, too frightened to ask questions. Indeed, I could scarcely think what I was saying, or what was being said to me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="然而，无论这一事件结果如何，也无论阿纳格诺斯先生站在哪一方，我仍感觉到当我走进他的办公室时，有人对我抱怀疑的态度，周围弥漫着敌对的气氛，其后发生的事也印证了这种感觉。而在此之前，每当我见到阿纳格诺斯先生时，他总会放下手头的工作，把我抱在膝上玩耍一会儿。在此后两年间，阿纳格诺斯先生似乎一直相信我和沙利文小姐是清白无辜的，但后来不知什么原因，他改变了看法。我不清楚调查的细节，甚至连那些没有与我说过话的调查组成员的名字都叫不出来。当时，我心情激动，顾不上注意其他事情，而且很是害怕，根本无法提出异议。事实上，我几乎回想不起来我说过什么话或者别人对我说了些什么。">查看中文翻译</div>
