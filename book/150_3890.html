<div class="line_en">During the next week she met him at three dances and now, his shyness perhaps wearing off a little, he was somewhat more communicative. He was a doctor, certainly, but he did not practise; he was a bacteriologist (Kitty had only a very vague idea what that meant) and he had a job at Hong Kong. He was going back in the autumn. He talked a good deal about China. She made it a practice to appear interested in whatever people talked to her of, but indeed the life in Hong Kong sounded quite jolly; there were clubs and tennis and racing and polo and golf.</div>

<div class="line_en">She wondered whether he told her these things with a motive. He seemed to like her society, but never by a pressure of the hand, by a glance or by a word, did he give the smallest indication that he looked upon her as anything but a girl whom you met and danced with. On the following Sunday he came again to their house. Her father happened to come in, it was raining and he had not been able to play golf, and he and Walter Fane had a long chat. She asked her father afterwards what they had talked of.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她怀疑他是不是故意跟她讲这些的。他好像喜欢她待在他身边，但从来也不用手碰她。没有一个眼神、一句话能给她个暗示，好让她以为她不仅仅是一个和他相遇并与之跳舞的姑娘而已。接下来的那个礼拜天，他又来到了她们的公寓。她的父亲由于下雨而取消了打高尔夫球的计划，刚好从外面回来。他和瓦尔特·费恩进行了一番长谈。后来她问父亲他们谈了些什么。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He was not her type at all. He was short, but not thick-set, slight rather and thin; dark and clean- shaven, with very regular, clear-cut features. His eyes were almost black, but not large, they were not very mobile and they rested on objects with a singular persistence; they were curious, but not very pleasant eyes. With his straight, delicate nose, his fine brow and well-shaped mouth he ought to have been good-looking. But surprisingly enough he was not. When Kitty began to think of him at all she was surprised that he should have such good features when you took them one by one. His expression was slightly sarcastic and now that Kitty knew him better she realized that she was not quite at ease with him. He had no gaiety.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他根本不是她喜欢的那种类型。他个子不高，一点也不强壮，又小又瘦。他皮肤发黑，也没留胡子，脸上轮廓分明，是再普通不过了。他的眼珠差不多是黑色的，但眼睛不大。他目光迟滞，盯住什么东西半天也不会放开。目光里倒是充满了好奇，却不会让人觉得有多舒服。光看他挺直、精巧的鼻子，清秀的眉毛和线条优美的嘴，他应该还是位美男子。但他偏偏不是。凯蒂在心里思忖，这个人要是单看他的五官，还真是相当英俊，简直会吓她一跳。他的表情微带一点嘲讽，在和他渐渐熟悉之后，凯蒂觉得跟他待在一块儿会让她浑身不自在。他太死气沉沉了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then came the announcement of Doris's engagement to Geoffrey Dennison. Doris, at eighteen, was making quite a suitable marriage, and she was twenty-five and single. Supposing she did not marry at all? That season the only person who had proposed to her was a boy of twenty who was still at Oxford: she couldn't marry a boy five years younger than herself. She had made a hash of things. Last year she had refused a widowed Knight of the Bath with three children. She almost wished she hadn't. Mother would be horrible now, and Doris, Doris who had always been sacrificed because she, Kitty, was expected to make the brilliant match, would not fail to crow over her. Kitty's heart sank.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时多丽丝和杰弗里·丹尼逊订婚了。门当户对的婚姻即将眷顾十八岁的多丽丝，而她二十五岁了，还是位单身老姑娘。难道这辈子嫁不出去了吗？今年唯一的求婚者是位二十岁的牛津大学生，而她决不会嫁给一个比自己小五岁的小男孩。她已经搞砸了好多次了。去年她拒绝了巴斯市一位鳏居的爵士，他带了三个孩子。她几乎后悔了。妈妈现在肯定很吓人。而多丽丝呢？为了凯蒂找到完美的夫君，她已经被迫做出了很多牺牲。如今，她一定会对凯蒂幸灾乐祸。凯蒂沮丧极了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">By the time the season drew to its end they had seen a good deal of one another, but he had remained as aloof and impenetrable as ever. He was not exactly shy with her, but embarrassed; his conversation remained strangely impersonal. Kitty came to the conclusion that he was not in the least in love with her. He liked her and found her easy to talk to, but when he returned to China in November he would not think of her again. She thought it not impossible that he was engaged all the time to some nurse at a hospital in Hong Kong, the daughter of a clergyman, dull, plain, flat-footed, and strenuous; that was the wife that would exactly suit him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在这一年即将结束的时候，他们已经见面无数次了。但是他还是和以前一样淡漠，难以捉摸出他的心思。和她在一起时他已经不再是害羞了，而是局促不安。他的谈话依然令人难解地缺乏活力。凯蒂得出结论说他一点也没有爱上自己。他只是喜欢她，觉得和她谈话比较合意。等到十一月他回到了中国，就会把她忘得一干二净。她怀疑他没准早跟香港医院里的某个护士订了婚，那人很可能是个传教士的女儿，迟钝、平庸、笨拙而又精力过剩，只有那样的女人才最适合他。">查看中文翻译</div>
