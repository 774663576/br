<div class="line_en">It was February 2003. I'd just arrived in China to start researching my second book, a collection of recipes from Hunan Province, and now I was in the midst of a major health panic. Hordes of frighted migrant workers were fleeing the centre of the growing epidemic in Guangdong Province, and many of them were returning to Hunan, which is precisely where I was planning to spend the next four months. And, of course, most of that time would be spent in the company of chefs, now pinpointed as the main human vectors of the epidemic.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那是二零零三年二月，我刚刚到中国，开始为我的第二本书做研究。这本书主要是搜集湖南省的地方菜谱，结果我却陷入了一场健康大恐慌。广东是“非典”肆虐的中心，惊恐的农民工成群结队地逃散，很多人要回湖南，那儿正是我接下来四个月要待的地方。而且，我的大部分时间肯定是和厨师们在一起，但现在他们成了湖南感染率最高的人群。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was one particular paragraph in the China Daily cover story that caught my eye. 'After four days of examination and investigation, the World Health Organisation team has found that most of the SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) patients in Guangdong, apart from local medical workers, are employed in the province's restaurant and food industries.' Oh shit.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="《中国日报》头版一篇文章中，有一段吸引了我的注意。“经过四天的检测和调查后，世界卫生组织团队发现，广东的‘非典’感染者中，除了当地的医疗工作者，大多受雇于该省的餐厅和食品工业。”啊，不要啊！">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In retrospect, my decision to write the book was altogether naïve. In my many years of travelling in China, I had never visited Hunan, and I knew no one who lived there. Furthermore, I knew virtually nothing about Hunanese cuisine, my attempts at preliminary research having been thwarted by the almost total absence of authentic Hunanese cookery books in either English or Chinese. In a way, that was the point: I wanted to write about an unexplored culinary region, and to discover it for myself. I was attracted, too, by the knowledge that Hunanese cuisine was hot and spicy like Sichuanese, that it was popular in the restaurants of Beijing and Shanghai, and that everybody told me it was delicious. There was also the intriguing fact that Chairman Mao had come from Hunan, and had retained a lifelong affection for its food. For a couple of years, I'd had the notion of writing a book in which recipes were interwoven with stories of China's revolutionary history, and Hunan struck me as being the perfect place to do it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在回想起来，我决定写那本书本身就很幼稚。在中国那么多年，从没去过湖南，在那儿也没有认识的朋友。而且，我对湘菜可谓一无所知，研究的起步阶段就非常受挫，因为不管是英文书还是中文书，都找不到一本地道的湖南菜谱。从某种程度上来说，这就是我的写作目的：我想写写英文世界还没人深入探索过的地方菜系，自己去摸索、去发现。而且，我知道湘菜和川菜一样讲究香辣，在北京和上海的餐馆很受欢迎，人人都跟我说湘菜很好吃，这对我很有吸引力。另外，毛主席是湖南人，一辈子都爱吃湘菜，这个故事也让我好奇心大增。几年来，我一直打算写本书，把菜谱和中国革命史上的故事结合在一起，湖南正是不二之选。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But as I scanned that newspaper report, I began to think that I might have made a serious mistake. I cast my mind back to the restaurant kitchen where I had spent that very morning -- a crowded, oil-blackened room where feeble extractor fans had done little to combat the savage fumes of sizzling chillies, which made us all choke and weep. Every so often, a junior chef had come up the stairs with a few freshly slaughtered chickens from a nearby poultry market, where birds and other creatures lurked in cramped cages, and the air was filled with drifting feathers and the smell of chicken waste. It was an ideal breeding ground for infection. Was this research project a good idea, I wondered?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但浏览了那个新闻报道之后，我开始觉得自己可能犯了个严重的错误。回想当天上午我待的那个餐馆后厨：拥挤不堪，到处都沾着厚厚的黑油；排风扇有气无力，根本抽不走爆炒辣椒那残暴勇猛的油烟，我们都被呛得喉咙发紧、眼泪直流。常有小厨子顺着楼梯上来，拿着几只从附近家禽市场现杀的鸡。在那个市场，禽鸟和其他动物被挨挨挤挤地关在笼子里，羽毛四处飘散。这可真是流行病毒滋生感染的温床啊。我不禁暗想，来做这个研究，真的好吗？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was a question that returned to me often over the next few weeks. I thought of it when I travelled on crowded minibuses, surrounded by coughing, spitting people. I thought of it after a banquet at a fashionable restaurant near the Hunanese capital, Changsha, to which I'd been invited by a new acquaintance, a local restaurateur. We sat in a pavilion decked out in Qing Dynasty style as the rain roared down outside. The ladies dominated the party, with their outrageous laughter and witty repartee; the men sipped their tea quietly, or knocked back cupfuls of strong and anaesthetising spirits. Towards the end of the meal, one of the waitresses brought in a clay pot of soup in which pieces of bony flesh mingled with slices of ginger. 'Civet cat!' announced my host, proudly. A few days later, civet cat was highlighted in the media as the possible source of the whole SARS epidemic.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接下来的几个星期，我一直在扪心自问。挨挨挤挤的小巴上，周围的人在咳嗽，唾沫飞溅，我想起这个问题；新认识了个本地的餐厅店主，她邀请我去湖南省会长沙附近一家很时尚的餐厅参加了个宴会，吃完以后我也想起这个问题。我们坐在一座装饰成清朝风格的楼台上，外面大雨如注。宴会的主角是一位位女士，笑声爽朗、妙语如珠；男人们则安静地啜饮香茶，或者仰头喝下麻醉神经的高度酒。菜快上完的时候，服务员端进来一只砂锅，里面是瘦肉混合着姜片的汤菜。“果子狸！”邀请我来的人很骄傲地高声宣布。几天后，媒体专门强调，果子狸可能就是整个“非典”疫情的始作俑者。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">With the benefit of hindsight, and the knowledge that SARS fizzled out after a few months, it is hard to remember how terrifying it was at the time. It really did seem for a while as if the whole of China might sicken, and many, many people die. There were those first, mysterious deaths in Hong Kong, traced back to a secret plague in Guangdong, covered up by the local authorities. Then came the spread of the virus across the country, the rapid explosion of cases in Beijing, the incarceration of the sick in makeshift hospitals.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我是个神经大条的“事后诸葛亮”，而且“非典”在几个月后就得到了控制，现在很难想起来当时自己有多害怕了。不过那段时间真的好像全中国，也可能是全世界，都在生病，而且死了很多很多人。先是香港有人离奇地死去，后追溯到广东被当地部门瞒报的疫情。接着病毒就在全国传播；北京迅速爆发疫情，病人被隔离在临时医院中。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the end, of course, I decided to stay. This was partly because I had a limited window of time in which to research my book, on account of my BBC commitments: if I missed this opportunity, I didn't know when I could come back for so long to China. But it was also out of a kind of fatalism. In the course of my Chinese adventures I had been in many risky situations. I had rattled along the brink of plunging chasms in clapped-out lorries, been caught in a blizzard late at night on a Tibetan mountain pass, eaten all kinds of questionable and unhygienic foods. I had spent my twenty-sixth birthday at a sinister party hosted for me by a branch of the Lanzhou mafia, and had narrowly escaped a lynching in the anti-foreigner riots that blew up after NATO bombed China's Belgrade embassy in 1999. More mundanely, I had spent more days than I could remember in restaurant kitchens with slippery floors, dodging chefs who rushed around with sharpened cleavers and unsteady woks filled with boiling oil.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="当然，最后我还是决定留下来。一是因为我为书做研究的时间有限：要是没抓住这次机会，我也不知道什么时候才能再在中国待这么长时间。但也有宿命论的驱使。我在中国的旅程本身就是一场探险，遇到过很多危急情况。我曾经坐着快要散架的卡车行驶在深渊的边缘；在西藏的山路上被困深夜的暴风雪中；还吃了各种各样不卫生的可疑食物。我的二十六岁生日是在一场凶险的聚会中度过的，是一群兰州的“黑帮分子”帮我办的；而一九九九年，北约炸毁中国在贝尔格莱德的大使馆时，中国爆发了“反外国人”的情绪，我也是万分幸运才免遭“私刑处死”的命运。举更普通一点的例子：我呆在后厨的日子数也数不清，而这些厨房很多都地上滑溜溜，厨子手里拿着锋利的菜刀到处跑，灶上的锅也摇摇晃晃不稳当，里面烧着滚烫的油。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I remember one winter in Yunnan Province, taking a bus back to Lijiang after hiking the perilous Tiger Leaping Gorge. Three other English people were on the bus too, and they pointed out that our driver was falling asleep. It was true: I looked in the windscreen mirror, and his eyelids were drooping, he could barely keep them open. Meanwhile the bus was lurching down a multitude of hairpin bends, the mountainside falling away in a sharp drop to one side. An anxious Englishman urged me to go and speak to the driver in Mandarin. So I asked the driver if he was feeling all right, to which he replied that he was perfectly fine, and would not fall asleep. I shrugged my shoulders and returned to my seat, but the driver's eyelids continued to droop, and the Englishman, far from reassured, went and sat next to him, and spent the next two or three hours singing to him, trying to keep him awake. 'What shall we do with the drunken sailor, what shall we do with the drunken sailor…' all the way down the mountain. The driver glanced at him from time to time, as if he were mad. It was a measure of how blasé I had become that I, too, thought the Englishman was overreacting.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="还记得某年冬天，在云南危险的虎跳峡远足之后，我搭大巴回丽江。车上还有三个英国人，他们提醒我，司机要睡着了。是真的：我看了看挡风玻璃上的镜子，他的上下眼皮都打架了，拉都拉不开。同时大巴正东倒西歪地行驶在九曲十八弯的山路上，一边是很陡峭的悬崖。有个英国人很紧张，恳求我过去用普通话提醒下司机。于是我就走过去，问司机是不是不舒服。他回答说，他很好，不会打瞌睡。我耸耸肩回到座位上，但司机的眼皮又沉重起来。而那英国人特别不放心，就走过去坐在他身边，接下来的两三个小时一直在唱歌给司机听，以免他睡着了。“这酒鬼水手啊我们该怎么办，这酒鬼水手啊我们该怎么办……”（这是一首英国民谣）一路唱到下山。司机偶尔瞟他一眼，眼神像看疯子似的。我也觉得这英国人反应有点夸张了：这想法说明，我已经成了个多么无动于衷、见怪不怪的人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When I first went travelling in China, I was a worrier, rinsing my chopsticks and rice bowls in boiling water before I ate, asking bus drivers if they really needed to drink half a bottle of rice vodka before driving over the Tibetan plateau in pitch darkness. Later, I realised that if you want a real encounter with another culture, you have to abandon your cocoon. It is necessary to dine with the natives in a metaphorical as well as a literal sense, and danger is part of the territory. Over time, I became nonchalant about risk.</div>

<div class="line_en">For the few few days, I was in a state of shock. I had expected Hunan as a neighbouring province to be akin to Sichuan, but in fact it was like another country. The local dialect was totally incomprehensible: for the first weeks I could understand nothing, unless people I met switched to standard Mandarin. The sounds of Hunanese, too, were a world away from the soft melodies of Sichuan dialect: the local tongue had a staccato beat, impatient and in-your-face, faintly aggressive. People in the streets, unused to foreigners, just stared at me blankly, without the warmth and curiosity I'd encountered in Chengdu. I had thought I knew China, but as always I had underestimated its vastness and diversity. In Hunan I realised, to my dismay, that I had to learn the workings of another culture, all over again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="接下来的几天，我都处在强烈的震惊当中。本来我想，湖南与四川相邻，应该很像吧。结果感觉跟到了另一个国家似的，方言完全听不懂。最初几个星期我什么也听不明白，除非对方换成标准普通话。湖南人的语气和声音也跟四川话的温柔顿挫天差地别。当地人说话不太连贯，有很多断音，比较火爆，常常劈头盖脸给你说一堆，完全没有我在成都遇到的温暖和好奇。我还以为自己很了解中国，但还是如往常一样，低估了这个国家的广大和多样。我很沮丧地意识到，我要从零开始，再学习和了解另一种文化了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But there was another reason for my decision to stay in Hunan: somehow I felt that I had bound myself to China, through thick and thin. It was an emotional as well as a professional commitment. My Chinese friends couldn't leave the country if a little trouble flared up; why should I? It was part of my life, like a marriage.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但我决定留在湖南，还有另一个原因：不知怎么，我觉得自己和中国之间有紧密的纽带，要风雨同舟。这既是出于职业道德，也是一种强烈的情感。我的中国朋友们不可能遇到什么突发状况就离开祖国，我为什么就要逃呢？这是我生命的一部分，就像一场婚姻。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">When I first arrived in Hunan, the slow train to Changsha disgorged me before dawn, at a forbidding Soviet-style station. Although I had no friends in the city, I had in my bag a clutch of phone numbers and letters of introduction from people in Chengdu food circles, including the number of a friend-of-a-friend who had found an apartment for me to rent. But it was not quite five in the morning, and far too early to call him or anyone else. Having nowhere to go, I hauled my luggage into the seedy station café, and sat for hours over a cup of tea, as shifty figures wandered around in the twilight. Later, I called my contact, and he came to pick me up on his scooter.</div>

<div class="line_en">Talking about food is a particularly good way to make friends in China, because everyone talks about it all the time. As soon as I mention my area of research, the floodgates of conversation open. And I have discovered more about China in general through my food explorations than I ever did when I was interested in explicitly social or political issues. People let their guard down over dinner. Yet, while researching my Sichuanese cookery book was a joy from beginning to end, the Hunan book was a completely different experience, shattering in many ways.</div>

<div class="line_en">I had no particular plan when I arrived in Changsha. My methodology for researching and writing about Chinese cookery is simple but chaotic. I just go somewhere with interesting food and find out everything I can about it. Usually I try to make contact with local chefs, food writers and members of the official culinary association. I comb bookshops and libraries for printed sources. Mainly, though, I just do what comes naturally to me, which is to talk to everyone I meet about food, and then follow them into their kitchens with my notebook. My work is like a treasure hunt, because I never know what each day may bring. I might waste days on a futile expedition, or, conversely, meet someone who in half an hour presses five out-of-print cookery books into my hands.</div>

<div class="line_en">I moved into my apartment, a sub-let in a concrete block that was part of a state work unit. It was grim, like most of Changsha. The Hunanese capital must have been beautiful, once. It has a recorded history of some three thousand years, and has been a cultural centre for more than two millennia. But the city was torched in 1938 as part of a botched response to the Japanese invasion. Temples, courtyard houses and grand old restaurants all went up in smoke and flames. Little survived apart from a small section of the Ming-Dynasty city walls, and the Yuelu Academy, a school of classical learning that was founded in the year 976 and now forms the heart of Hunan University. The 'old' part of town that I found in 2003 consisted of one or two shabby streets by the river, dating back mainly to the post-war years; the only older remains were some ancient flagstone slabs with which one of these streets was paved (even they have since been removed, to make way for a pedestrianised shopping precinct). The rest of the city was a grim miasma of concrete and flyovers, shrouded in a suffocating pall of pollution. And in the spring of 2003, it rained almost every day.</div>

<div class="line_en">Living in Hunan made me realise how exceptional Sichuan was, and how easy it had been to live there as a foreigner. The Sichuanese are so laid-back and charming; there is always an undertone of sweetness to their manner, as there is to their food. The spiciness of Hunan, by contrast, is bold and uncompromising. People have no patience with sweetness, here. Dishes are seasoned with fresh, dried and pickled chillies, more aggressively hot than they are in Sichuan, combined with the punchy sourness of vinegar and pickled vegetables, the forthright saltiness of fermented black soybeans. The mellow, autumnal red of Sichuan chilli-bean paste plays but a small part in the local cuisine: people in Hunan prefer the striking scarlet of fresh and pickled chillies.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="和湖南一比，我在四川的经历实在宛若天堂。在成都当个外国人，真的太安逸了。首先，我在一所大学里住了很长时间，社交圈早就形成了，我自然而然地加入进去，想都不用想就交了很多朋友。而且，那时候的我年轻、充满理想主义，愿意撕破人生既定的地图重新开始。而到湖南的时候，我年纪大了，头脑更清醒了，而且孤身一人，真不知道从哪里开始。四川也一定是中国最热情的地方了。四川人本身的闲散和可爱就是出了名的，他们的一言一行里总有微妙的体贴，正如川菜中若隐若现的甜味。而相比之下，湖南的辛辣就莽撞而刚烈。湘菜的调味有鲜椒、干辣椒和泡椒，那辣味比川菜更猛更冲，还大量地放醋和泡菜，里面的豆豉也有种直白干脆的咸味。四川那带着秋之枫红的醇香豆瓣酱在湘菜里也会用，但用得很少：湖南人更喜欢鲜椒和泡椒那种夺人眼球的鲜红。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The Hunanese are often similarly brusque in manner. The professional culinary people to whom I had been introduced were largely friendly, but they were busy, and not especially interested in either me or my work. Most of them were sceptical at the idea that an alien might write a book about their cuisine: the Hunanese themselves had barely written anything about the cultural and historical background to their food; how on earth could an outsider attempt it? (I once spent an amusing afternoon in a teahouse with two local journalists who chatted to me in Mandarin, and to each other in Hunanese. By then I was already becoming acquainted with the local dialect, but they didn't know it. So I listened to one of them explain to his friend that my ludicrous project was doomed to fail. To me, in Mandarin, he offered some patronising words of encouragement.)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="湖南人的举止给我留下的第一印象一如湘菜：莽撞直率。由旁人引荐的烹饪专业人士都很友好，但不清楚该怎么对待我或者我的工作；有几个直截了当地表达了对外国人写湘菜的怀疑。这也很合理：当时连湖南本地都不大有人去写湘菜的文化和历史背景，一个外人干吗做这个无用功？（有一天下午，我和两位湖南记者在茶馆聊天，他们对我就说普通话，互相之间就说湖南话，真是有趣。那时候我已经比较熟悉当地方言了，但他们不知道，所以我就那么听着其中一个对另一个说我这个可笑的行动一定会失败，然后又用普通话对我说了些鼓励的话，当我三岁小孩儿似的。）">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Hunan also seemed to me, after ten years of travelling in China, to be provincial and old-fashioned in many ways. It was inward-looking, and way off the map for tourists. No foreigners went to Hunan unless they had to, for business or to adopt a Chinese baby. But to the Hunanese, as I quickly discovered, their province is the centre of the universe, no question. For the last two hundred years, it has produced a disproportionate number of movers and shakers, from the Qing Dynasty General Zuo Zongtang (the General Tso of chicken fame) to Mao Zedong and a whole host of communist luminaries.

<div class="line_en">In the eyes of the Hunanese, their province is the beating heart of the nation, an engine of talent that has powered China forth on its road to modernity since the nineteenth century. They see themselves as clever, capable and straightforward: an ideal blend of northern strength and southern softness, without the slippery cunning of the Sichuanese. Likewise, they think Hunanese cuisine is perfectly balanced, unlike the sickly-sweet fare of the East, and the irritating food of Sichuan, which is so tingly and numbing that you can't taste anything. Often, I had the impression that people in Hunan considered the rest of China, not to mention the rest of the world, to be largely irrelevant.</div>

<div class="line_en">Some of the people I met in those first weeks were immensely kind to me. One female restaurateur took me under her wing. She gave me free rein in her kitchens, and had a habit of whisking me away in her chauffeur-driven car for day trips that involved lavish banquets, market shopping, and indulgent sessions in foot-washing emporia. The manager of the old Guchengge restaurant let me study in his kitchen, too, and it was there that I learned many of my favourite Hunanese dishes. Otherwise, it was hard going. Changsha felt deeply foreign to me, and I met no one with whom I really clicked. The few overseas teachers I ran into in my first week or so fled the country as the SARS epidemic spread, and I never saw any tourists. Most nights I spent hours on the phone to old friends in Chengdu, Beijing and Shanghai, but my days were long and lonely. Unwilling on principle to sacrifice my personal life for my work, I came to the brink of abandoning my entire Chinese food-writing career. That's when I met Liu Wei and Sansan.</div>

Even today, Chinese schoolchildren are occasionally obliged to take part in 'Learn from Lei Feng' campaigns, although a certain cynicism has crept in to the public view of him. Lei Feng is not alone as a communist role model: in the nineties the party sought to revive flagging public morals with a campaign based on the heroism of another young soldier named Xu Honggang, who was reportedly stabbed in the stomach by thieves while defending a woman bus passenger. (The official media gave a memorable description of Xu's brave deed: 'Holding his dangling intestines with his sleeveless sweater, he jumped out of the window of the bus to chase the criminals despite acute pain.') But if Lei Feng is not the only star in the firmament of socialist heroes, he has always been my favourite.</div>

I'd always had a soft spot for Lei Feng, the communist model soldier known as the 'rustless screw'. He was born in 1940, into an impoverished household just outside Changsha, and was orphaned at a very young age. Later, he joined the People's Liberation Army, where he distinguished himself by doing good deeds like darning his comrades' socks and making tea for his superiors. In 1963, his diary, a paean to the glories of communism, was 'discovered' by Chairman Mao and propagated as an inspiring set-text for generations of schoolchildren. A cheerful song was written in his honour: 'Learn from Lei Feng! What a good role model! Loyal to the revolution, loyal to the Party!'</div>

Lei's childhood home, a mud-brick cottage, had been engulfed by a vast sprawl of pavilions filled with boring communist propaganda, and there were almost no visitors besides me. The children of Changsha, I supposed, were these days glued to the TV or the computer screen, their role models David Beckham and Britney Spears. At the foot of the Lei Feng statue near the entrance to the park, I fell into conversation with a stranger. When he saw the sketches in my notebooks he seemed to feel a certain affinity with me, so he gave me his phone number and told me to call if I felt like it.

Their little son, Xuzhang, was playing on the floor when we arrived, and the main room was decorated with carved wooden panels and other antiques. They invited us to sit down in the 'tea room', where a carved Guanyin Buddha presided over offerings of fruit and incense, and old tapestries hung on the walls. Liu Wei set the kettle to boil, and started performing the delicate ritual of gong fu cha, a Fujianese tea ceremony. Sansan called some other friends, a calligrapher, a designer and an antique-collecting businessman, and we stayed up half the night, drinking fine oolong tea, nibbling nuts and sweetmeats, and talking about everything you can imagine.

They and their friends, mostly writers, artists and other 'intellectuals', were nostalgic for the lost ways of the Chinese literati. They were hardworking and technologically savvy, but they gathered in the evenings to drink tea, practise calligraphy, and listen to classical Chinese music. Somehow they found, and created, places of beauty and tranquillity in the concrete jungle in which they lived; at weekends they went on day trips in search of Buddhist monasteries and ancient villages.

A low, mud-brick farmhouse lay at the foot of a hill, flanked by old camphor trees and teeming undergrowth.

I've been shadowed by a plain-clothes policeman through the cornfields of northern Sichuan, and turned back at military checkpoints in the mountains of the far west of China. Most of the time these suspicious officials clearly feared that I was collecting information for human rights groups or news organisations rather than stealing the secrets of red-braised pork.

Then there was that long spell as a 'sub-editor' at the BBC Monitoring Unit at Caversham, a mysterious organisation that most people confuse with the government spy station, GCHQ.

<div class="line_en">Vegetarianism has a long association with Buddhism in China, but there were no explicit prohibitions on the consumption of meat in the rules of early Buddhism. In ancient India, Buddhist monks were allowed to eat whatever food was put into their begging bowls, including meat, as long as they didn't suspect an animal had been killed for their benefit. When Buddhism began to enter China around two thousand years ago, Buddhist acolytes fell in with mainstream Indian teachings in their acceptance of meat-eating under certain circumstances. It was Emperor Wu Di of the sixth-century Liang Dynasty who did much to promote vegetarianism as the norm for Chinese Buddhist monasteries. He was a Buddhist convert who became a lifelong vegetarian and advocated vegetarianism on compassionate grounds.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="中国佛家的素食历史由来已久，不过早期佛教的训诫中并没明确规定不可吃荤。古印度的和尚可以吃任何放进化缘钵里的东西，肉也可以，只要别人不是专门杀生给他们吃的就行。大约两千年前，佛教刚刚传入中国时，教徒们服从来自印度的主流训诫，在特定情况下吃肉是被普遍接受的。到了公元六世纪，南北朝的梁武帝才大力在中国佛寺中推行吃素的戒律。梁武帝本人也信佛，终生吃素，以慈悲为怀、不杀生的理由来推广素食。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">These days Chinese Buddhist monks live on a mainly vegan diet, while lay Buddhists can choose the degree to which they maintain a vegetarian regimen. Some renounce meat on certain days of the calendar or while visiting a temple; others are completely vegetarian. Buddhist monasteries all over China keep vegetarian kitchens, and in many of the larger establishments there are restaurants providing food for tourists and pilgrims. Such restaurants offer astonishing banquets, where vegetarian ingredients are used to create dishes that mimic the appearance, taste and texture of fish and meat. So you might have, for example, deep-fried 'beef' slivers made from the stalks of shiitake mushrooms, 'spare ribs' fashioned from pieces of wheat gluten impaled on 'bones' of hard bamboo shoot, and a 'fish' that is really a mass of seasoned mashed potato, wrapped in beanmilk skin, deep-fried and covered in sauce. Such culinary subterfuge enables monasteries to entertain their wealthy patrons in suitably opulent Chinese style, but these grand dishes bear little relation to the everyday diet of the monks themselves, which consists mainly of simple grains, legumes and vegetables.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在，中国的和尚仍然较为严格地吃素，而俗家弟子们则可以选择吃素的程度：有些会在特定的日子或者进庙里烧香拜佛的时候拒绝荤腥，而有的就是完全的素食主义者了。全中国的佛寺都有斋厨，很多规模较大的寺庙还有为游客与香客提供斋饭的餐厅。这些餐厅的宴席令人惊讶：利用素食食材创造出与大鱼大肉在外观、味道和口感上都相差无几的菜品。比如，你可能吃到用香菇蒂做的“炸牛肉丝”；硬脆的竹笋包裹上面筋做成的“肋排”；还有土豆泥经过调味，包上豆腐皮，炸制之后淋上酱汁做成的“鱼”。在做法上耍一些“手段”，各个佛寺就能迎合那些富有的赞助人，摆一桌体面的中式盛宴。但这些大菜跟和尚们自己每日的吃食没什么关系，日常的饮食都是简简单单的清粥小菜、粗茶淡饭。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I had realised quite how Chinese I was becoming in my tastes when, shortly before I left for Hunan, I went for a walk in a Kentish village and passed a field of geese. In my pre-China life, I would just have seen them as part of the scenery of the village. This time, before I knew it, I was imagining them braised in a sauce of chilli paste and Sichuan pepper, bubbling away on a gas burner. I caught myself at it, and smiled. It was true what they said about the Chinese: everything that moved, everything that ran across the earth apart from the motor car, everything that flew through the sky apart from the aeroplane, everything that swam in the sea apart from the ship, was a potential ingredient. Once in Hunan, embarrassingly, I assumed that a bagful of live frogs that Liu Wei's nephew had brought on a daytrip with us were for lunch -- when in fact he was planning to release them into the wild as part of his Buddhist practice.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="深切认识到我的口味已经多么中国化，是在离开湖南后不久，我到英国肯特郡一个小村庄去散心，路遇一大群鹅。去中国以前，这在我眼里不过就是乡村风景的一部分。现在，我下意识地就在想象，鹅肉放在豆瓣酱和花椒里一起炖，锅子在煤气炉上咕嘟咕嘟冒泡。我意识到自己在这么想，笑了。他们评价中国人的话很恰切：只要是能动的东西，地上跑的除了汽车、天上飞的除了飞机、海里游的除了轮船，都能拿来吃了。在湖南有一次我也把自己弄得很尴尬：和刘伟之一起出去一日游，他侄儿带了一袋活青蛙来，我想当然地以为是午饭的食材，其实他是用来放生的，是佛家的一种修行。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At that time I was reaching my own peak of omnivorousness. The Hunanese were almost as extreme as the Cantonese in their wide-ranging eating habits, and in the course of my research, I ate dog hotpot, braised frogs and deep-fried timber grubs without giving it much thought. The carnage of the markets hardly bothered me.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那时正是我个人“杂食”的高峰期。湖南人吃的东西之杂之广，几乎可与广东人一较高下。我在调查研究的过程中自然也是入乡随俗：我没有多想便吃了狗肉火锅、炖牛蛙和炸昆虫。市场里残忍屠杀的景象并没让我怎么烦恼。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Through my friendship with Liu Wei, I found myself spending much of my spare time with vegetarians. We paid a visit to a sprightly eighty-one-year-old monk in a Changsha temple, who talked to me about the health benefits of a meat-free diet, and assured me that the flesh of the dog was such an inflaming meat that eating it would drive the most devout friar to break his vow of celibacy. One weekend we went to a hilltop monastery where a renowned Buddhist sage was teaching: there, we lunched simply on rice and vegetables.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="和刘伟之交上了朋友，我在闲暇时间就经常接触到素食主义者。我们到长沙一座寺庙拜访了一位精神矍铄的老和尚，他给我讲了吃素对身体的种种好处，还言之凿凿地说狗肉会让身体中的恶欲燃烧，就算最虔诚的禅师吃了，也会打破禁欲的誓言。一个周末，我们来到一座山顶寺庙，听一位著名的佛家法师教导佛法，那里的午餐就是简单的米饭加蔬菜。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Any fool could see that the most dangerous place for a healthy person to go at that time was the respiratory diseases clinic of a hospital. But, as usual, I was faced with the simple choice: do I want to be sensible, or do I want to write this book? So I went to the respiratory diseases clinic, where I stood at the centre of a small crowd of spluttering, feverish people, trying not to breathe too much, as a doctor wearing a flimsy gauze mask listened to my chest with a stethoscope. He was apparently satisfied with what he heard, and gave me a certificate covered in official stamps. So I was able to regain access to my apartment compound.</div>

<div class="line_en">Meanwhile, the SARS epidemic raged on. People were sick and dying in many parts of the country. Beijing had got it badly, and everyone suspected that Shanghai would be next. Six people in Hunan were ill with the virus, and one had died, although they had reportedly all caught the disease outside the province. Life in Changsha became increasingly difficult. One day I returned home to my flat and was stopped at the entrance gate by security guards. 'Health certificate,' one of them said, holding out his hand. 'But I live here,' I said, 'I've been living here for a month.' 'No, I'm afraid you need a health certificate,' he said. 'We'll let you in for now, but you'd better go to the hospital for a check-up or we won't allow you to return to the compound.'</div>

<div class="line_en">The shadow of SARS began to darken every aspect of life in Hunan. Men and women in white coats would leap at me in the entrances of department stores and hotels, and take my temperature with a gun-like gadget. Posters hung all over the city, as they had done during the Cultural Revolution, this time warning not of 'capitalist roaders' but of the need for vigilance against coughs and fevers. The Guchengge restaurant where I had spent so many days of study closed down, like many others, because most people had stopped going out to eat. When Liu Wei, Sansan and I had lunch in one of the few fashionable restaurants that had remained open, waitresses in green surgical masks came to take our order, their voices muffled by the gauze. One night, a bored millionaire, a client of Liu Wei's design business, took us to a luxurious country club, where he hired a former member of the national tennis team to give us lessons on a floodlit court. Afterwards we showered in the vast, unpeopled changing rooms, and drank tea in a drafty café lounge where ranks of empty tables and chairs extended almost as far as we could see.</div>

<div class="line_en">Trips out of town became a nightmare. When I pitched up at the bus station, I had my temperature taken by people clad from head to toe in germ-warfare whites; boarding a bus, I had to write down my name, passport number, address, telephone number, and seat number, just in case I or any other passenger fell sick. One day when I drove to Changde with some friends, our car was surrounded by a swarm of masked inspectors who covered it in disinfectant. And despite the fact that SARS had been hatched and incubated in China by a combination of official secrecy, poor hygiene and nasty slaughter practices, people were often wary of a foreigner like me, because they feared I might recently have arrived from the infected south. Sometimes I had my temperature taken four or five times in a single day.</div>

<div class="line_en">The epidemic also threatened to have an effect on table manners. In general in China, shared dishes are placed at the centre of the table, and you serve yourself using your own chopsticks. Before the Cultural Revolution, which encouraged a certain proletarian boorishness, more refined people would avoid touching food on the common dishes with the tips of their own chopsticks. Instead, they would use the handles of their chopsticks to transfer food from the common dishes to their bowls, and then turn the sticks around again to eat. Alternatively, they would use gong kuai, 'public chopsticks' that would be placed at the side of each serving dish, and would never enter anyone's mouth.</div>

<div class="line_en">During the height of SARS paranoia, people in Hunan started talking about gong kuai again. At dinner parties, 'public chopsticks' would be laid at the side of each serving dish, so we didn't have to risk contamination by each other's saliva. The host would say something ostentatious about the need for gong kuai, and invite everyone to use them, and then we would all talk about how important it was to be hygienic under the circumstances. But no one ever actually used the gong kuai in more than a token fashion. It just felt too artificial, and before long they were left forlornly at the side of the plates, and we all carried on helping ourselves and eating as normal.</div>

<div class="line_en">Like many people I knew, I developed psychosomatic SARS symptoms that were quite alarming, including a nasty, hacking cough. I was fever-free, so felt sure I didn't have the deadly pneumonia, but I knew perfectly well that if anyone saw me coughing in public, I could be carted off to a hospital and kept there under lock and key until they were sure I was clean (or until I caught the fatal bug from another patient). Rumours abounded of people being incarcerated in isolation wards, their mobile phones confiscated.

<div class="line_en">Chinese people reacted to SARS either with nonchalance, or with deranged anxiety. Some continued to go out and about, smoking, spitting and coughing in the streets. Many security guards wore their obligatory facemasks slung low, so they could put cigarettes into their mouths. Meanwhile, other people barricaded themselves in their homes, refusing to receive visitors, sipping vinegar as a supposed prophylactic and using fumigation and disinfectant washes in an attempt to sterilise everything around them.

<div class="line_en">In China, more than anywhere else, you are what you eat. The right foods will sustain your health; the wrong ones will make you ill. As they say: 'bing cong kou ru (sickness enters through the mouth).' While the Chinese often find it embarrassing or difficult to discuss emotional matters directly, they use food as a way to address them. At moments when an Italian friend would have thrown her arms around me and encouraged me to talk, a Chinese friend would thrust another bowlful of soup into my hands, urging me sternly to 'Drink, drink!' The idea of food as medicine, medicine as food runs through every aspect of Chinese social intercourse: it is a constant background chatter. My private Chinese teacher at Sichuan University used to give me candied fruits or walnuts to 'build my brain' if she felt that my spirits were flagging. And that day in Gansu Province, when I disgraced Liu Yaochun's family by falling ill and weeping, his relatives demonstrated their concern for me by bringing out a frozen melon that they had kept, stowed away under the eaves, since October. Sometimes this ceaseless fussing over my diet would irritate me, but I came to understand that it was an expression of love.</div>

<div class="line_en">Food is used to heal and balance the mind and body in many different ways. Chinese folk dietetics have much in common with the humoral systems of the Ancient Greeks, Persians and Indians, all of which classify foodstuffs according to whether they are 'heating' or 'cooling', and, to a lesser extent, 'moistening' or 'drying'. No one is sure exactly where the roots of these traditions lie, but it seems likely that they influenced China in the early part of the first millennium, when Buddhism was entering the country with all kinds of foreign ideas. The humoral system, anyway, must have resonated deeply with the ancient Chinese concepts of yin and yang.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在很多方面，食物都可以用来疗愈与平衡身心。中国民间的膳食学和古希腊、古波斯和古印度的“体液论”有很多共通性。食物都是按照“热性”和“凉性”来分类，或者分得更细，“湿性”与“干性”。没人能确定这些传统的根源在哪里，但似乎在公元的第一个千年，佛教和各种外国理念传入中国时，就对这个国家有所影响。总之，“体液论”一定是与古中国的“阴阳”概念有强烈共鸣的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the heating-cooling scheme of things, some symptoms, like fevers and rashes, are the expression of an excess of fire; they must be countered with cooling foods like lettuce and cucumber; other symptoms, like diarrhoea, may indicate a surfeit of cold, and must be tackled by a warming diet of meat and ginger. The energetic balance of an individual's body is influenced not only by climate, but also by the seasons: this is why, in Hunan in midwinter, some people like to eat the exceptionally 'hot' meat of the dog. The classification of foods is a matter of both empirical observation and superstition: dog, for example, is a high-calorie food and really does help to raise the body heat of someone malnourished in winter, while the idea that walnuts nourish the brain and cashews the kidneys because they resemble the organs has its roots in sympathetic magic.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="如果用热性和凉性的学说来解释，像发烧皮疹这些症状，就说明体内火气太旺，要吃莴苣、黄瓜等凉性食物来降火；而腹泻等症状则说明体寒、摄入凉性食物过多，要吃肉、吃姜来暖胃、暖身。人体精力的平衡，不仅受到气候变化的影响，四季的流转也是重要的因素之一。所以，在湖南的隆冬，有些人会吃狗肉这种特别燥热的食物。食物的归类，不仅是通过观察、积累经验的结果，也有迷信的成分：比如，狗肉的卡路里很高，的确可以让冬日里手脚冰凉的人身体热乎起来；而核桃能补脑、腰果能补肾的说法，则是因为其本身的样子和相应人体器官形似，这就接近一种“交感巫术”了。">查看中文翻译</div>

Salt-water chicken with Astragalus or milkvetch root, for example, 'nourishes the kidneys and boosts yang energy', while lotus root with carrot 'relieves internal heat and detoxifies'. In general, the most serious Chinese tonic dishes have bland and understated flavours: think, for example, of a broth, unsalted, made with a whole duck and the fabulously expensive Tibetan caterpillar fungus, or an unseasoned black-rice congee with barley, foxnuts, lily bulb, lotus seeds, jujubes and wolfberries. Tong Ren Tang, however, is a fashionable restaurant, where people go to enjoy themselves as well as to restore their health, so everything tastes delicious. Ironically, the last time I dined there, I ate so many dishes intended to rebalance my body that I thought I would simply explode.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="成都有家著名的餐厅叫“同仁堂”（2），是专做药膳的，和历史悠久的“同仁堂”中药房同名，也是其分支。餐厅的菜单是按季节变化的，每道菜都会列出其滋补功效。例如，黄芪盐水鸡的作用就是“补肾壮阳”，而金银凉瓜可以“清热解毒”。大体上来说，做得比较严谨认真的中国药膳味道都比较清淡，比如：一碗肉汤没放盐，整只鸭子放里面，加上天价的西藏虫草炖煮；不调味的黑米粥，加薏仁、芡实、百合、莲子、红枣和枸杞子。然而，同仁堂是一家比较时尚的餐厅，人们在这里既能补身健体，也能满足口腹，每道菜都十分美味。讽刺的是，上次我在那里吃饭，调节身体平衡的菜吃得太多，觉得自己胀得快要爆炸了。【注：（2）准确的名字应该是“御膳宫”，在同仁堂药店的楼上。】">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In China, there is no strict boundary between ingredients that are considered primarily as foods, and those that are considered to be medicinal herbs. The white radish, a common vegetable, is cooling and can be used in the treatment of ailments of the lung and stomach. Ginseng is an expensive and age-old tonic medicine that you might find in your herbal prescription from a Chinese doctor, but you might equally well be served it in a venison soup. Some foods are taken to rebalance the body; others to enhance its functioning. Women seeking to become pregnant might cook with gou qi zi or Chinese wolfberries, because they act as a tonic on the reproductive organs. And if you see a group of businessmen tucking into an ox-penis hotpot -- well, you can easily guess what they have in mind.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="中国的食材与药材之间没有严格的界限。白萝卜是种常见的蔬菜，凉性，可以用来治疗肺部和胃部的小毛病。昂贵的人参从古时候起就是上好的补药，中医可能会在给你的药方里写上这味补药，而鹿肉汤里面也有可能加这个作食材。有的食物可以平衡体内的气血，有的则能加强某些部位的功能。备孕心切的女性可以在食物里加点枸杞子，可以加强生殖器官的机能。要是你看见一群生意人围坐吃着牛鞭火锅，嗯，很容易就猜得出他们肚子里打的什么如意算盘吧。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Chinese bookshops now have enormous sections devoted to medicinal cookbooks that offer advice on the properties of different foods and the treatment of ailments. They might be modern and glossy, but they have ancient roots. Ritual texts on the staffing of the ancient Zhou Dynasty court referred to the lofty status of the 162 dieticians in charge of the daily menus of the royal family; while the Ming Dynasty Compendium of Materia Medica listed the curative properties of many ordinary foodstuffs, and included forty-four recipes for medicinal porridge. In China today, the older generation don't usually need to consult books on dietetics. They just know that you shouldn't eat aubergine with cucumber, and that the dangerously cold flesh of the hairy crab should be counterbalanced with Shaoxing wine and heating ginger. When they fall sick, they will self-medicate through diet long before they consider visiting the doctor. 'Yao bu bu ru shi bu' is a Chinese saying: 'repairing and nourishing with medicine is not as good as repairing and nourishing with food'.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="现在，中国的书店里摆了很多药膳菜谱，列出了不同食物的滋补功效和可以治疗的疾病。这些书都有着现代书籍精美的装帧，但根却是来自远古。《周礼》中就记载了周朝皇室的日常餐食有一百六十二名营养师把关，他们在朝廷的地位也相当崇高；明朝的《本草纲目》则列出了很多普通食材的疗效，里面还有四十四种养生粥的做法。在今天的中国，老辈人们通常不用参考药膳菜谱，他们本身就很清楚茄子与黄瓜不能同吃；大闸蟹肉虽美味，却是大寒，必须用绍兴酒或者热性的姜来中和；生病的时候，他们最先并不是去看医生，而是用食物来自我治疗。中国人有句老话说得好：“药补不如食补。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Over the years, I have found myself deeply influenced by the Chinese approach to treating mind and body through food. If I have an outbreak of spots on my face, I steer clear of heating foods like pork and lychees; I know to drink green tea and eat cucumbers on a hot summer's day. This is partly an irrational response to familiarity with Chinese ways -- I've no idea if these food practices actually work. Yet it is also a rational acceptance of the pervasive Chinese notion that I as an individual should take responsibility for my own health, that I can't just gorge myself on inappropriate foods and then expect my doctor to sort me out with a pill. In China, people try to treat their illnesses at their roots, and now that's what I try to do, too. I accept the need for Western medicine in times of acute illness, but I rarely take pills for low-level complaints like headaches. Instead, I interpret such symptoms as a sign that I need to treat myself better, with healthy food, rest and exercise. And occasionally, of course, with a soup of caterpillar fungus.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="多年来，我发现自己也深受中国人用食物疗愈身心的影响。要是脸上爆痘，我会远离猪肉、荔枝等上火的食物；而炎热的夏天，我会喝点绿茶、吃点黄瓜，清爽降火。这算是熟悉中国人养生之道后比较不理智的反应吧，因为我也不知道这样到底有没有用啊。不过，这是一种很合理的结果：接受中国人所普遍认同的、要为自己身体健康负责的理念，所以不能想吃什么就敞开吃，然后指望医生能开个药就把我的病治好。在中国，人们讲究消除病根，我现在也在努力践行这一点。生急病的时候，我当然也会吃西药；但遇到像轻微头痛这种小毛病时，我已经很少吃药了，而是把这种症状解读为身体在告诉我要更好地对待自己，吃得健康点、多休息、多锻炼；当然，偶尔也可以喝上一碗虫草汤。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">In the plague days of 2003, the people of Changsha tweaked their diets in an attempt to boost their immunity to SARS. Waitresses in restaurants offered customers cups of anti-SARS herbal teas as an aperitif. People queued up to fill bottles with spring water from the ancient White Sand Well because they were sure it had curative properties.</div>

<div class="line_en">One day the manager of the Changsha Food and Drink Company, Liu Guochu, invited me to lunch at the historic Huogongdian restaurant with some longstanding members of its staff. The dishes we ate included a whole stuffed duck, wrapped up tightly in lotus leaves and rice straw, stir-fried asparagus with the flesh of crayfish, and sticky-sweet glutinous rice dumplings. We talked at length about the history of the restaurant: its origins as a temple to the Fire God, and its heyday as a place where storytellers, musicians and snack sellers gathered to entertain the crowds of temple pilgrims. The conversation was fascinating and the food delicious, but the spectre of SARS hung over the feast. 'You must drink more of the chicken and papaya soup,' said Manager Liu, 'it'll be good against the pneumonia'.</div>

<div class="line_en">All spring, we worried about the disease. I listened every night to the BBC World Service for bulletins on the progress of the epidemic, and kept my ears open anxiously for every rumour in Changsha. My cough worsened, and I slept fitfully. But despite the flood of labourers returning to Hunan from infected regions, the public spitting, and the steady march of the disease across parts of northern China, it never really hit Hunan. Most people were convinced that this was because they ate chillies. 'Look at the map,' they would say. 'Do you see any SARS in Sichuan, Hunan, Guizhou, Yunnan: all the places where they like to eat spicy food?'</div>
