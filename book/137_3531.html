<div class="line_en">It is ten o'clock in the morning; everything is indicative of the day after a festival. The pavement is covered with rubbish; ribbons, rags, feathers from tufts of plumes, drops of wax from the torches, crumbs of the public feast. A goodly number of bourgeois are "sauntering," as we say, here and there, turning over with their feet the extinct brands of the bonfire, going into raptures in front of the Pillar House, over the memory of the fine hangings of the day before, and to-day staring at the nails that secured them a last pleasure. The venders of cider and beer are rolling their barrels among the groups. Some busy passers-by come and go. The merchants converse and call to each other from the thresholds of their shops. The festival, the ambassadors, Coppenole, the Pope of the Fools, are in all mouths; they vie with each other, each trying to criticise it best and laugh the most. And, meanwhile, four mounted sergeants, who have just posted themselves at the four sides of the pillory, have already concentrated around themselves a goodly proportion of the populace scattered on the Place, who condemn themselves to immobility and fatigue in the hope of a small execution.</div>

<div class="line_en">If the reader, after having contemplated this lively and noisy scene which is being enacted in all parts of the Place, will now transfer his gaze towards that ancient demi-Gothic, demi-Romanesque house of the Tour-Roland, which forms the corner on the quay to the west, he will observe, at the angle of the façade, a large public breviary, with rich illuminations, protected from the rain by a little penthouse, and from thieves by a small grating, which, however, permits of the leaves being turned. Beside this breviary is a narrow, arched window, closed by two iron bars in the form of a cross, and looking on the square; the only opening which admits a small quantity of light and air to a little cell without a door, constructed on the ground-floor, in the thickness of the walls of the old house, and filled with a peace all the more profound, with a silence all the more gloomy, because a public place, the most populous and most noisy in Paris swarms and shrieks around it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="读者既已观赏过广场各处上演的这出喧闹的活剧，现在要是掉转目光，看看堤岸西角上罗朗塔楼那座古老的半峨特、半罗曼式建筑，就会发现正面拐角上有一部公用精装祈祷书，放在披屋里遮雨，有道栅栏挡着防小偷，但是手可以伸进去翻阅。在这部祈祷书旁边有一个狭小的尖拱窗洞，两道铁杠交叉拦着，开向广场：这是唯一的透气孔，空气和日光可以稍稍透进一间小室。这间斗室没有门。它是在塔楼底层的厚厚墙壁上开凿出来的。室内安静异常，一片死寂，恰恰这时外面那全巴黎的人最拥挤、最吵闹的广场正熙熙攘攘、人声鼎沸，斗室的安静就更加深沉，死寂也就愈显凄凉了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This little cell had been celebrated in Paris for nearly three centuries, ever since Madame Rolande de la Tour-Roland, in mourning for her father who died in the Crusades, had caused it to be hollowed out in the wall of her own house, in order to immure herself there forever, keeping of all her palace only this lodging whose door was walled up, and whose window stood open, winter and summer, giving all the rest to the poor and to God. The afflicted damsel had, in fact, waited twenty years for death in this premature tomb, praying night and day for the soul of her father, sleeping in ashes, without even a stone for a pillow, clothed in a black sack, and subsisting on the bread and water which the compassion of the passers-by led them to deposit on the ledge of her window, thus receiving charity after having bestowed it. At her death, at the moment when she was passing to the other sepulchre, she had bequeathed this one in perpetuity to afflicted women, mothers, widows, or maidens, who should wish to pray much for others or for themselves, and who should desire to inter themselves alive in a great grief or a great penance. The poor of her day had made her a fine funeral, with tears and benedictions; but, to their great regret, the pious maid had not been canonized, for lack of influence. Those among them who were a little inclined to impiety, had hoped that the matter might be accomplished in Paradise more easily than at Rome, and had frankly besought God, instead of the pope, in behalf of the deceased. The majority had contented themselves with holding the memory of Rolande sacred, and converting her rags into relics. The city, on its side, had founded in honor of the damoiselle, a public breviary, which had been fastened near the window of the cell, in order that passers-by might halt there from time to time, were it only to pray; that prayer might remind them of alms, and that the poor recluses, heiresses of Madame Rolande's vault, might not die outright of hunger and forgetfulness.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="将近三百年来，这个蜗居在巴黎大大有名。当年，罗朗塔楼的罗朗德夫人为了悼念在十字军远征中阵亡的父亲，在自家房屋底层的墙壁上开凿出来之后，她自己就幽居在里面，过了一辈子，门也给砌死了，不分冬夏，只有窗洞开着。整个府邸，她只留下这样一间陋室，其他都赠送给了穷人，献给了上帝。凄苦的宫廷命妇当真在这座提前置办的坟墓里等待死亡，等了二十年，日夜为亡父祈祷，就睡在炉灰里，甚至不用石头作枕头，身穿黑色麻布口袋，只赖过路人怜悯放置在窗洞边沿上的面包和水为生。这样，在自己施舍家财之后也来接受人家的施舍了。她临终之际，就是说，在转入另一座坟墓的时候，她把丢下的坟墓永远遗赠给受痛苦的妇女：母亲、寡妇或女儿，她们有许多愁怨要为别人或自己祈祷，宁愿活埋在剧烈痛苦或严峻忏悔之中。她那时代的穷人为她用眼泪和祝福举行了隆重的葬礼；但是，他们极为遗憾的是：这虔诚的女人因为没有后台，未能列为圣人。他们中间那些不怎么虔诚的人希望天堂里办事情也许要比在罗马顺当得多，就干脆为亡灵向上帝祈祷，既然得不到教皇的恩准。不过，大多数人也只是把对罗朗德夫人的怀念奉为神圣，把她留下的破衣褴衫当作圣物。巴黎城则为悼念这位女贵人设置了一部公用祈祷书，固定安置在小室的窗洞附近，让过路人随时停下脚步，哪怕只是祈祷一下；也想让人在祈祷时想起布施，使继承罗朗德夫人的洞穴、隐修在里面的那些可怜的女人，不致完全因为饥饿和被遗忘而死去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Moreover, this sort of tomb was not so very rare a thing in the cities of the Middle Ages. One often encountered in the most frequented street, in the most crowded and noisy market, in the very middle, under the feet of the horses, under the wheels of the carts, as it were, a cellar, a well, a tiny walled and grated cabin, at the bottom of which a human being prayed night and day, voluntarily devoted to some eternal lamentation, to some great expiation. And all the reflections which that strange spectacle would awaken in us to-day; that horrible cell, a sort of intermediary link between a house and the tomb, the cemetery and the city; that living being cut off from the human community, and thenceforth reckoned among the dead; that lamp consuming its last drop of oil in the darkness; that remnant of life flickering in the grave; that breath, that voice, that eternal prayer in a box of stone; that face forever turned towards the other world; that eye already illuminated with another sun; that ear pressed to the walls of a tomb; that soul a prisoner in that body; that body a prisoner in that dungeon cell, and beneath that double envelope of flesh and granite, the murmur of that soul in pain;-- nothing of all this was perceived by the crowd. The piety of that age, not very subtle nor much given to reasoning, did not see so many facets in an act of religion. It took the thing in the block, honored, venerated, hallowed the sacrifice at need, but did not analyze the sufferings, and felt but moderate pity for them. It brought some pittance to the miserable penitent from time to time, looked through the hole to see whether he were still living, forgot his name, hardly knew how many years ago he had begun to die, and to the stranger, who questioned them about the living skeleton who was perishing in that cellar, the neighbors replied simply, "It is the recluse."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在中世纪的城市里，这类坟墓并不少见。在最热闹的街道、最拥挤最吵闹的市场，时常就在人群当中，马蹄之下，车轮之下，有那么一个地洞、一口井、一间砌死了的上了栅栏的斗室，里面日夜祈祷着一个生灵，自愿献身于某种永恒的悲叹、某种重大的悔罪。这一奇特景象在我们心中唤起种种思考：这可怕的小室就像是房屋和坟墓之间、墓地和居民区之间的中间环节，内中的那个活人已同人类社会斩断任何联系，从此被列为死者，这盏灯在黑暗中耗尽最后一滴油。这生命的残余在地洞里摇曳，这呼吸、这嗓音永远祈祷在石头匣子里，这张脸永远朝向冥间，这双眼睛已经闪耀着另一世界的太阳，这对耳朵紧贴着墓壁，这灵魂囚禁在肉体之中，这肉体囚禁在牢房之中，在肉与石双重重压之下痛苦的灵魂不断呻吟——这一切在我们心中唤起的种种思考，是并不为当时的群众所理解的。那个时代的人的虔诚并不合乎理性，也不顾念人情，对于宗教行为，他们看不见这么许多方面。他们笼而统之看待事物，尊敬、崇奉一切牺牲，如有必要就奉为神圣，从不剖析其中的痛苦；不时送一份口粮来给可怜的忏悔者，看看洞里的人是不是还活着，忘记了他姓什名谁，也不大清楚他开始奄奄一息已经几年了，陌生人要是问到这个地洞里腐烂下去的活骷髅是谁，如果是个男的，邻人就答道：“他是隐修男；”如果是女的，就答道：“她是隐修女。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Moreover, although people were but little surprised by it, the examples of this sort of cloistration in the hearts of cities were in truth frequent, as we have just said. There were in Paris a considerable number of these cells, for praying to God and doing penance; they were nearly all occupied. It is true that the clergy did not like to have them empty, since that implied lukewarmness in believers, and that lepers were put into them when there were no penitents on hand. Besides the cell on the Grève, there was one at Montfauçon, one at the Charnier des Innocents, another I hardly know where,-- at the Clichon House, I think; others still at many spots where traces of them are found in traditions, in default of memorials. The University had also its own. On Mount Sainte-Geneviève a sort of Job of the Middle Ages, for the space of thirty years, chanted the seven penitential psalms on a dunghill at the bottom of a cistern, beginning anew when he had finished, singing loudest at night, magna voce per umbras, and to-day, the antiquary fancies that he hears his voice as he enters the Rue du Puits-qui-parle -- the street of the "Speaking Well."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="况且，虽然人们并不感到惊异，这样遁世幽居的例子，有如前述，就在各个城市中心实际上也是屡见不鲜的。在巴黎就有相当多的这类祈祷上帝、进行忏悔的小室，差不多全是有人的。确实，教士们千方百计不让它们空着，因为这会意味着信男信女们不太热乎了，所以，要是没有忏悔者，就把大麻风关进去。除了河滩那间小室以外，在鹰山还有一间，在圣无辜婴儿墓地也有一间，还有一间在什么地方已经搞不清楚，也许是在克利雄府邸吧。还有好些在其他地方，已经没有建筑遗址，只余口碑相传的痕迹。大学城也有它那种。那是在圣日内维埃芙山上，有那么一位中世纪的约伯（16）。他在一道水槽底部的一座粪堆上唱忏悔七诗唱了三十年，唱完了又从头唱起，夜里唱得更响亮（magna voce per umbras）。即使今天，好古成癖的人还觉得走进“说话井”街就可以听见他的歌声。【注：（16）据《旧约全书·约伯记》，天降各种灾祸给约伯，约伯“坐在炉灰中，拿瓦片刮身体”，苦行忏悔，耶和华终于赐福于他。】">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">To confine ourselves to the cell in the Tour-Roland, we must say that it had never lacked recluses. After the death of Madame Roland, it had stood vacant for a year or two, though rarely. Many women had come thither to mourn, until their death, for relatives, lovers, faults. Parisian malice, which thrusts its finger into everything, even into things which concern it the least, affirmed that it had beheld but few widows there.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这里我们只说罗朗塔楼的地洞，我们得说它从来没有空过。罗朗德夫人死后，难得有一、两年没有人住。许多女人住进去，为亲人、情人，为自己的错误哀悼，直至去世。恶毒的巴黎妇女什么都掺和，最不相干的事也不放过，硬说是其中寡妇简直没有住过。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In accordance with the fashion of the epoch, a Latin inscription on the wall indicated to the learned passer-by the pious purpose of this cell. The custom was retained until the middle of the sixteenth century of explaining an edifice by a brief device inscribed above the door. Thus, one still reads in France, above the wicket of the prison in the seignorial mansion of Tourville, Sileto et spera; in Ireland, beneath the armorial bearings which surmount the grand door to Fortescue Castle, Forte scutum, salus ducum; in England, over the principal entrance to the hospitable mansion of the Earls Cowper: Tuum est. At that time every edifice was a thought.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="按照当时的习俗，墙上刻着一句拉丁文铭记，告诉过路的有学问的人这间小室虔诚的用途是什么。延至十六世纪中叶，习俗仍然是：用镌刻在门楣上的一句简短格言来解释一座建筑。例如，现在在法国还可以看到屠维耳领主府邸的监狱窗口上方有这样一句话：Sileto et spera（17）；在爱尔兰，福特斯居城堡大门上面的纹章下写着：Forte scutum，salus ducum（18）；在英格兰，考柏伯爵那殷勤待客的府邸主要入口上面是：Tuum est（19）。因为，当时的任何建筑物都表达一种思想。【注：（17）拉丁文，沉默和希望。（18）拉丁文，强大的盾，是领袖的救援。Forte scutum，与福特斯居谐音。（19）拉丁文，归君所有。表示主人好客之意。】">查看中文翻译</div>
