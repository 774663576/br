<div class="line_en">Langdon scanned the shelves searching for Gianlorenzo Bernini. He began his search about midway down the first stack, at about the spot he thought theB 's would begin. After a moment of panic fearing the ledger was missing, he realized, to his greater dismay, that the ledgers were not arranged alphabetically. Why am I not surprised?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登浏览著那些书架，寻找吉昂洛伦佐．贝尼尼。他从第一个书架中段开始，就在他认为应该是B字头开始的地方。有那麽一会儿他很恐慌，担心自己要找的分类帐遗失了，然后才更沮丧地明白，这些分类帐不是按照字母顺序排列的。奇怪我怎麽不惊讶？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was not until Langdon circled back to the beginning of the collection and climbed a rolling ladder to the top shelf that he understood the vault's organization. Perched precariously on the upper stacks he found the fattest ledgers of all-those belonging to the masters of the Renaissance -- Michelangelo, Raphael, da Vinci, Botticelli. Langdon now realized, appropriate to a vault called "Vatican Assets," the ledgers were arranged by the overall monetaryvalue of each artist's collection. Sandwiched between Raphael and Michelangelo, Langdon found the ledger marked Bernini. It was over five inches thick.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="直到兰登回到第一个书架，爬上一道有脚轮的滚动梯子，到了顶端那格，找到整套帐本的起点，才明白这个书库的结构。他不太稳地站在梯子上，面对著上面几格，才发现最厚的几本帐册是属于文艺复兴大师──米开朗基罗、拉斐尔、达文西、波提且利。现在兰登明白，这些分类帐的排列是按每个艺术家收藏品的金钱价值总额，果然符合这个书库的名称「梵蒂冈资产」。兰登找到了标示著贝尼尼的分类帐本，夹在拉斐尔和米开朗基罗之间，厚度超过五吋。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The book was cloth-bound and very solid. The ledger was handwritten in Italian. Each page cataloged a single work, including a short description, date, location, cost of materials, and sometimes a rough sketch of the piece. Langdon fanned through the pages… over eight hundred in all. Bernini had been a busy man.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那本帐册是布面装帧，非常结实。裡面的分类帐以义大利文手写记录。每一页记录一件作品，包括简短的描写、日期、地点、材料成本、有时还有作品的简略草图。兰登一页页翻著──总共有八百件作品，贝尼尼当时一定是个大忙人。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As a young student of art, Langdon had wondered how single artists could create somuch work in their lifetimes. Later he learned, much to his disappointment, that famous artists actually created very little of their own work. They ran studios where they trained young artists to carry out their designs. Sculptors like Bernini created miniatures in clay and hired others to enlarge them into marble. Langdon knew that if Bernini had been required topersonally complete all of his commissions, he would still be working today.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登年轻时代学习艺术史的时候，曾好奇一个艺术家一生怎麽可能创造出那麽多作品。后来他才明白，令他大失所望的是，知名艺术家自己实际动手的只佔一小部份。他们有工作室，会训练年轻艺术家执行他们的设计。像贝尼尼这样的雕塑家会用黏土做出模型，然后雇用其他人製作成大型的大理石作品。现在兰登知道，如果贝尼尼要自己一个个动手完成所有的委託案，那他忙到今天都还做不完。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Index," he said aloud, trying to ward off the mental cobwebs. He flipped to the back of the book, intending to look under the letterF for titles containing the word fuòco -- fire -- but the F's were not together. Langdon swore under his breath. What the hell do these people have against alphabetizing?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="「索引。」他大声说，想把纷乱的思绪抛开。他翻到帐册后面，想找字母F项下包括了fuoco（火）这个字的作品，但含F的作品并没有归在一起。兰登低声诅咒著。见鬼这些人干嘛不肯用字母排序？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">As Langdon stared at the list, another disheartening thought occurred to him. The title of the sculpture he was looking for might not even contain the wordFire. The previous two works -- Habakkuk and the AngelandWest Ponente -- had not contained specific references toEarth orAir.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登盯著那份清单，又想到另一件令人沮丧的事情。他在找的那件雕塑的名称，可能根本就没有「火」这个字。前面两件作品──《哈巴谷与天使》和《西风》──就都没有特别包含了土和气。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He spent a minute or two flipping randomly through the ledger in hopes that an illustration might jump out at him. Nothing did. He saw dozens of obscure works he had never heard of, but he also saw plenty he recognized…Daniel and the Lion, Apollo and Daphne, as well as a half dozen fountains. When he saw the fountains, his thoughts skipped momentarily ahead. Water. He wondered if the fourth altar of science was a fountain. A fountain seemed a perfect tribute to water. Langdon hoped they could catch the killer before he had to considerWater -- Bernini had carved dozens of fountains in Rome, most of them in front of churches.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他花了一两分钟随意翻著那本分类帐，指望某个草图可能会突然让他豁然开朗。结果没有。他看到了几十件从没听说过的冷僻作品，但也看到很多他认得的……《但以理与狮子》、《阿波罗与黛芙妮》，还有六座喷泉。他看到那些喷泉时，思绪一时往前跃进。水。他纳闷著第四个科学祭坛会不会是喷泉。兰登希望他们能在非得去想水之前抓到那个杀手──贝尼尼在罗马雕刻了几十座喷泉，大部分都位于教堂前。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Langdon turned back to the matter at hand. Fire. As he looked through the book, Vittoria's words encouraged him. You were familiar with the first two sculptures…you probably know this one too. As he turned to the index again, he scanned for titles he knew. Some were familiar, but none jumped out. Langdon now realized he would never complete his search before passing out, so he decided, against his better judgment, that he would have to take the book outside the vault. It's only a ledger, he told himself. It's not like I'm removing an original Galilean folio. Langdon recalled the folio in his breast pocket and reminded himself to return it before leaving.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登回到眼前的工作。火。他翻著那本帐册，薇多利雅的话鼓励著他。前两座雕塑都是你熟悉的……这座你说不定也晓得。他又转向索引，寻找他晓得的作品名称。有些熟悉，但都没让他联想到什麽。现在兰登明白，他还没找到就铁定会昏过去了，于是他决定违背自己的原则，把这本书带出书库。这不过是本分类帐，他告诉自己。不像把伽利略著作散页的原件带出去。兰登想到那张书页还在他的胸袋裡，提醒自己走前要归回原位。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Hurrying now, he reached down to lift the volume, but as he did, he saw something that gave him pause. Although there were numerous notations throughout the index, the one that had just caught his eye seemed odd.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他急著想抓起那本书，却看到什麽让他暂停了动作。虽然索引中有很多注，但刚刚吸引他目光的那则，却好像特别怪。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The note indicated that the famous Bernini sculpture, The Ecstasy of St. Teresa, shortly after its unveiling, had been moved from its original location inside the Vatican. This in itself was not what had caught Langdon's eye. He was already familiar with the sculpture's checkered past. Though some thought it a masterpiece, Pope Urban VIII had rejectedThe Ecstasy of St. Teresa as too sexually explicit for the Vatican. He had banished it to some obscure chapel across town. What had caught Langdon's eye was that the work had apparently been placed in one of the five churches on his list. What was more, the note indicated it had been moved thereper suggerimento del artista.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那则注指出，贝尼尼著名的雕塑《圣女大德兰的狂喜》在公开展示后不久，就从原来梵蒂冈内的陈列地点移走了。吸引兰登目光的不是这则注本身，他已经知道这件作品多变的过往历史。虽然某些人认为这是一件杰作，但教宗伍朋八世却排斥《圣女大德兰的狂喜》，认为这件作品太明确表现性欲，不适合放在梵蒂冈，于是把这件作品放逐到罗马城中某个不起眼的小教堂。而吸引兰登目光的是，这件作品显然位于他所列出的五个教堂之一。更甚者，那条注指出雕塑是在「艺术家的建议之下」，移到那裡的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As Langdon's excitement mounted, his vague familiarity with the statue intervened, insisting the work had nothing to do withfire. The sculpture, as anyone who had seen it could attest, was anything but scientific-pornographic maybe, but certainly not scientific. An English critic had once condemnedThe Ecstasy of St. Teresa as "the most unfit ornament ever to be placed in a Christian Church." Langdon certainly understood the controversy. Though brilliantly rendered, the statue depicted St. Teresa on her back in the throes of a toe-curling orgasm. Hardly Vatican fare.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登兴奋起来，但他对那座雕像的模糊熟悉感又冒出来搅局，坚持那件作品跟火扯不上关系。任何见过的人都可以证实，那座雕塑什麽都是，就是一点也不科学──或许称得上色情，但绝对不是科学雕像。一个英格兰评论家曾极力谴责《圣女大德兰的狂喜》是「基督信仰教堂中有史以来最不恰当的装饰品」。兰登当然了解这件作品所引发的争议。儘管作品外观华丽，但这座雕像描绘圣女大德兰仰天倒地，沉浸在性高潮的撼动中，连脚趾都扭曲了。实在不适合梵蒂冈。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">By suggestion of the artist? Langdon was confused. It made no sense that Bernini had suggested his masterpiece be hidden in some obscure location. All artists wanted their work displayed prominently, not in some remote --</div>

<div class="line_en">He was fearful even to entertain the notion. Was it possible? Had Bernini intentionally created a work so explicit that it forced the Vatican to hide it in some out-of-the-way spot? A location perhaps that Bernini himself could suggest? Maybe a remote church on a direct line withWest Ponente 's breath?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他简直是害怕接受这个想法。有可能吗？贝尼尼故意创作这麽一件明显的作品，迫使梵蒂冈必须把它藏到某个偏僻之处？一个或许贝尼尼本人可以建议的地点？或许是个偏僻的教堂，就在《西风》吹出气的那条直线上？">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">St. Teresa was a nun sainted after she claimed an angel had paid her a blissful visit in her sleep. Critics later decided her encounter had probably been more sexual than spiritual. Scrawled at the bottom of the ledger, Langdon saw a familiar excerpt. St. Teresa's own words left little to the imagination:</div>

<div class="line_en">Langdon smiled. If that's not a metaphor for some serious sex, I don't know what is. He was smiling also because of the ledger's description of the work. Although the paragraph was in Italian, the word fuòco appeared a half dozen times:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="兰登微笑起来。如果这不是在隐喻某种激烈的性交，那我真不晓得什麽才是了。他微笑也是因为分类帐上对这件作品的描述。虽然那段话是义大利文，但fuoco（火）这个字出现了六次：">查看中文翻译</div>
