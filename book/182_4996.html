<div class="line_en">When they were able at last to go back to the edge of the gorge (nearly a mile below the point from which they had started) they found the cliffs on their side of it a good deal lower and more broken. Soon they found a way down into the gorge and continued the journey at the river's edge. But first they had a rest and a long drink. No one was talking any more about breakfast, or even dinner, with Caspian.</div>

<div class="line_en">To keep along the edge of the gorge was not so easy as it had looked. Before they had gone many yards they were confronted with young fir woods growing on the very edge, and after they had tried to go through these, stooping and pushing for about ten minutes, they realized that, in there, it would take them an hour to do half a mile. So they came back and out again and decided to go round the fir wood. This took them much farther to their right than they wanted to go, far out of sight of the cliffs and out of sound of the river, till they began to be afraid they had lost it altogether. Nobody knew the time, but it was getting to the hottest part of the day.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="沿着峡谷在悬崖边上行进并不轻松。没走多远，这一行人便被茂密的小杉树丛挡住了去路，只好弯下身来，拨开树叶，缓慢地向前移动。他们很快意识到，照这样走下去，一个小时也走不了半里路。于是他们向后转，退出丛林，并做出新的决定——绕道而行。他们向右边绕得很远很远，看不见峭壁，也听不到水声了。大家开始担心是不是整个路线都搞错了。谁也不知道确切的时间，但气温已经是一天中最高的了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They may have been wise to stick to the Rush instead of going along the top. It kept them sure of their direction: and ever since the fir wood they had all been afraid of being forced too far out of their course and losing themselves in the wood. It was an old and pathless forest, and you could not keep anything like a straight course in it. Patches of hopeless brambles, fallen trees, boggy places and dense undergrowth would be always getting in your way. But the gorge of the Rush was not at all a nice place for travelling either. I mean, it was not a nice place for people in a hurry. For an afternoon's ramble ending in a picnic tea it would have been delightful. It had everything you could want on an occasion of that sort -- rumbling waterfalls, silver cascades, deep, amber-coloured pools, mossy rocks, and deep moss on the banks in which you could sink over your ankles, every kind of fern, jewel-like dragon flies, sometimes a hawk overhead and once (Peter and Trumpkin. both thought) an eagle. But of course what the children and the Dwarf wanted to see as soon as possible was the Great River below them, and Beruna, and the way to Aslan's How.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这是一片古老的、没有人迹的森林，里面没有一条直路。大丛大丛根本进不去的荆棘，倒了的大树，沼泽地，以及茂密的低矮林丛，不时在前面挡住他们的去路。这地方真可谓路途艰难，更何况他们又是些匆忙赶路的人；如果是漫步郊游，走累了在这里野餐，那么倒是不错。这里的景致应有尽有，轰鸣的大瀑布、银光闪闪的小瀑布、深深的琥珀色水潭、覆盖着青苔的岩石，还有岸边厚厚的泥沼，不小心走上去，会一下子陷到脚踝。此外，各种蕨类植物和宝石般的蜻蜓举目可见；头顶上时而掠过一只隼，甚至偶尔可以看到雄鹰在空中朝翔。当然啰，他们此时想要尽快看到的，是前面的大河口，是柏卢纳，是通向阿斯兰堡垒的道路。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">As they went on, the Rush began to fall more and more steeply. Their journey became more and more of a climb and less and less of a walk -- in places even a dangerous climb over slippery rock with a nasty drop into dark chasms, and the river roaring angrily at the bottom.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="下面的路越来越陡，他们行进得也越来越艰难，越来越慢——有时甚至要冒险在滑溜的岩石上攀行，身下是可怕的黑暗深渊，湍急的河水汹涌澎湃。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">You may be sure they watched the cliffs on their left eagerly for any sign of a break or any place where they could climb them; but those cliffs remained cruel. It was maddening, because everyone knew that if once they were out of the gorge on that side, they would have only a smooth slope and a fairly short walk to Caspian's headquarters.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="就这样，他们紧盯着脚下的峭壁，一边努力搜寻着任何一个缝隙，任何一个可攀爬的地方。险道无情，令人恼火，可是大家咬紧牙关继续向前走，相信一旦走出峡谷，再穿过一段平缓的山坡，就会到达凯斯宾的指挥部了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The boys and the Dwarf were now in favour of lighting a fire and cooking their bear-meat. Susan didn't want this; she only wanted, as she said, "to get on and finish it and get out of these beastly woods". Lucy was far too tired and miserable to have any opinion about anything. But as there was no dry wood to be had, it mattered very little what anyone thought. The boys began to wonder if raw meat was really as nasty as they had always been told. Trumpkin assured them it was.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，男孩子们和小矮人主张找个平坦些的地方，架起篝火，烤些熊肉充饥。苏珊却不同意，她坚持要“走下去，走到底，走出这可憎的地方”。露茜这时已经疲惫不堪，什么意见也不想提了。其实，这一路上，根本看不到平地和干柴，所以主意再好也是白搭。两个男孩肚子里咕咕直叫，开始怀疑生肉是否真如想象中的那样脏，那样难以下咽。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The river gorge had just made a bend and the whole view spread out beneath them. They could see open country stretching before them to the horizon and, between it and them, the broad silver ribbon of the Great River. They could see the specially broad and shallow place which had once been the Fords of Beruna but was now spanned by a long, many-arched bridge. There was a little town at the far end of it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="峡谷到了尽头，河水在这里转了个弯。从崖顶望去，展现在他们面前的是一片崭新的天地——开阔的平原一直向前延伸，仿佛与天空浑为一体。横在大平原与他们之间的河水，就像一条宽宽的银色缎带，缓缓流过。有一处河面格外宽，河水也格外浅，孩子们一下子都认出来那就是柏卢纳渡口，惟一不同的是现在那里架起了一座长长的多孔桥。再向前望去，桥的另一端通向一个小村落。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They turned and wriggled along uphill, under the bracken amid clouds of horribly buzzing flies. Arrows whizzed round them. One struck Susan's helmet with a sharp ping and glanced off. They crawled quicker. Sweat poured off them. Then they ran, stooping nearly double. The boys held their swords in their hands for fear they would trip them up.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们转过身，在灌木丛的掩护下，在成群苍蝇令人厌恶的嗡嗡声中，往山上爬去。一支箭射在苏珊的头盔上，迸出了火星。他们加快爬行的速度，片刻间便一个个大汗淋漓，气喘吁吁。过了一会儿，他们索性站起身，猫着腰跑起来。男孩子们跑在后面，手里紧握着宝剑，以防敌人追上来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They were all getting on at a quicker pace now. The going became easier. Though there were still sheer cliffs on their left, the ground was becoming lower on their right. Soon it was no longer a gorge at all, only a valley. There were no more waterfalls and presently they were in fairly thick woods again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="休息片刻后，这一行人继续往前走，大家加快脚步。道路也好走了一些。虽然左边还有峭壁悬崖，右边的平地却渐渐开阔起来，不久，他们进入了一片茂密的丛林。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then -- all at once -- whizz, and a sound rather like the stroke of a woodpecker. The children were still wondering where (ages ago) they had heard a sound just like that and why they disliked it so, when Trumpkin shouted, "Down', at the same moment forcing Lucy (who happened to be next to him) flat down into the bracken. Peter, who had been looking up to see if he could spot a squirrel, had seen what it was -- a long cruel arrow had sunk into a tree trunk just above his head. As he pulled Susan down and dropped himself, another came rasping over his shoulder and struck the ground at his side.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="突然，“嗖——”什么东西从他们头顶飞过，然后打在树干上，那声音就像啄木鸟在树上啄了一下。孩子们还在纳闷曾经在什么地方听到过类似的使人感到不舒服的声音，就听杜鲁普金喊了一声“卧倒！”同时使劲把身边的露茜按倒在灌木丛中。彼得本来正朝上面看，想瞧瞧有没有松鼠，结果却看到一支锐利无情的箭，刚好掠过头顶深深扎进身旁的树干。他急忙拉了苏珊一把，让她卧倒。自己刚刚弯下身，另一支箭已经射了过来，擦着他的肩头，扎在身边的地上。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was heart-breaking work -- all uphill again, back over the ground they had already travelled. When they felt that they really couldn't run any more, even to save their lives, they all dropped down in the damp moss beside a waterfall and behind a big boulder, panting. They were surprised to see how high they had already got.</div>

<div class="line_en">They reached the fir wood which had caused them so much trouble while it was still daylight, and bivouacked in a hollow just above it. It was tedious gathering the firewood; but it was grand when the fire blazed up and they began producing the damp and smeary parcels of bear-meat which would have been so very unattractive to anyone who had spent the day indoors. The Dwarf had splendid ideas about cookery. Each apple (they still had a few of these) was wrapped up in bear's meat -- as if it was to be apple dumpling with meat instead of pastry, only much thicker -- and spiked on a sharp stick and then roasted. And the juice of the apple worked all through the meat, like apple sauce with roast pork. Bear that has lived too much on other animals is not very nice, but bear that has had plenty of honey and fruit is excellent, and this turned out to be that sort of bear. It was a truly glorious meal. And, of course, no washing up -- only lying back and watching the smoke from Trumpkin's pipe and stretching one's tired legs and chatting. Everyone felt quite hopeful now about finding King Caspian tomorrow and defeating Miraz in a few days. It may not have been sensible of them to feel like this, but they did.</div>

<div class="line_en">Lucy woke out of the deepest sleep you can imagine, with the feeling that the voice she liked best in the world had been calling her name. She thought at first it was her father's voice, but that did not seem quite right. Then she thought it was Peter's voice, but that did not seem to fit either. She did not want to get up; not because she was still tired -- on the contrary she was wonderfully rested and all the aches had gone from her bones -- but because she felt so extremely happy and comfortable. She was looking straight up at the Narnian moon, which is larger than ours, and at the starry sky, for the place where they had bivouacked was comparatively open.</div>

<div class="line_en">She got up, her heart beating wildly, and walked towards them. There was certainly a noise in the glade, a noise such as trees make in a high wind, though there was no wind tonight. Yet it was not exactly an ordinary treenoise either. Lucy felt there was a tune in it, but she could not catch the tune any more than she had been able to catch the words when the trees had so nearly talked to her the night before. But there was, at least, a lilt; she felt her own feet wanting to dance as she got nearer. And now there was no doubt that the trees were really moving moving in and out through one another as if in a complicated country dance. ("And I suppose," thought Lucy, "when trees dance, it must be a very, very country dance indeed.') She was almost among them now.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她站起身来，心怦怦地跳着，慢慢朝那个方向走去。在那片空地上似乎有什么响动，虽然这时一点儿风都没有，可是树木却发出了沙沙声。当然，这绝对不是树林通常发出来的那种声音。露茜感到那沙沙声隐隐伴着一种旋律，可她辨不出那是怎样的旋律，正如前天夜里她听不清那些树的窃窃私语一样。可至少她听得出有一定的节奏，再往前走近一些，她觉得自己的双脚随着那节奏不由自主地竟想要跳舞了。这时，已经不必怀疑，那些树真的是在动——往来交错，像是一场挺复杂的民间舞蹈。这时她几乎是置身于它们之间了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Why, I do believe they're moving," she said to herself. "They're walking about."</div>

<div class="line_en">The first tree she looked at seemed at first glance to be not a tree at all but a huge man with a shaggy beard and great bushes of hair. She was not frightened: she had seen such things before. But when she looked again he was only a tree, though he was still moving. You couldn't see whether he had feet or roots, of course, because when trees move they don't walk on the surface of the earth; they wade in it as we do in water. The same thing happened with every tree she looked at. At one moment they seemed to be the friendly, lovely giant and giantess forms which the tree-people put on when some good magic has called them into full life: next moment they all looked like trees again. But when they looked like trees, it was like strangely human trees, and when they looked like people, it was like strangely branchy and leafy people -- and all the time that queer lilting, rustling, cool, merry noise.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她遇到的第一棵树看上去像是个巨人，长着粗乱的胡子和蓬松的头发。她一点儿不害怕，反而感到老友重逢的喜悦。那巨人在笨拙地摆动着，你看不到它的脚，或者说树根，因为它移动的时候，不是踩在地面上，而是在土里蹬来动去，就像我们走在水里一样。她望望别的树，全是这样。它们时而呈现出友善、可爱的巨人形状，像被施了魔法，时而又恢复了树的本来面目。当它们现出树的形状时，看上去是非常奇特的人形树；而当它们现出人形时，那样子又很像奇特的生着枝叶的树形人。那奇异的节奏和欢快的沙沙声一直在响着。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">A circle of grass, smooth as a lawn, met her eyes, with dark trees dancing all round it. And then -- oh joy! For he was there: the huge Lion, shining white in the moonlight, with his huge black shadow underneath him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="在她的眼前是一片平整的草坪，周围是深颜色的大树在舞蹈。啊，阿斯兰！他在那儿！那威风凛凛的巨狮在月光下巍然不动，地上投下他一大片黑黑的身影。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She went fearlessly in among them, dancing herself as she leaped this way and that to avoid being run into by these huge partners. But she was only half interested in them. She wanted to get beyond them to something else; it was from beyond them that the dear voice had called.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她毫无惧色地走到它们中间，一边不停地跳来跳去，免得被这些高大的伙伴碰倒。露茜此时并不想跳舞，她匆匆走过婆娑多姿的树群，去寻找别的什么——正是从树林的另一边，传来那亲切的声音，一声声把她呼唤。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She soon got through them (half wondering whether she had been using her arms to push branches aside, or to take hands in a Great Chain with big dancers who stooped to reach her) for they were really a ring of trees round a central open place. She stepped out from among their shifting confusion of lovely lights and shadows.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她很快就穿过树林（搞不清她是用手臂把树枝推开的呢，还是拉住了那些高大的向她弯下腰来的舞蹈家的手），从那可爱的光和影的不断交替所造成的迷惑中走了出来。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But for the movement of his tail he might have been a stone lion, but Lucy never thought of that. She never stopped to think whether he was a friendly lion or not. She rushed to him. She felt her heart would burst if she lost a moment. And the next thing she knew was that she was kissing him and putting her arms as far round his neck as she could and burying her face in the beautiful rich silkiness of his mane.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="要不是他的尾巴摆了一下，你简直看不出那是一个有灵性的血肉之躯。露茜毫不迟疑地向他跑去，根本就没有停下来想一想，这会不会是一只凶恶的、吃人的狮子。她激动万分，只觉得稍一放慢脚步，那颗火热的心就会从胸腔里跳出来。在一片兴奋的迷茫中，她记得自己用双臂紧紧地搂住阿斯兰的脖子，不停地呼唤他，亲吻他，并且把自己的脸埋进他那美丽而有光泽，像缎子般柔软光滑的鬃毛里面。">查看中文翻译</div>

The trees parted to let them through and for one second assumed their human forms completely. Lucy had a glimpse of tall and lovely wood-gods and wood-goddesses all bowing to the Lion; next moment they were trees again, but still bowing, with such graceful sweeps of branch and trunk that their bowing was itself a kind of dance.</div>
