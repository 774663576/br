<div class="line_en">They don't feel a thing there, Cam thought, looking at the shore, which, rising and falling, became steadily more distant and more peaceful. Her hand cut a trail in the sea, as her mind made the green swirls and streaks into patterns and, numbed and shrouded, wandered in imagination in that underworld of waters where the pearls stuck in clusters to white sprays, where in the green light a change came over one's entire mind and one's body shone half transparent enveloped in a green cloak.</div>

<div class="line_en">Then the eddy slackened round her hand. The rush of the water ceased; the world became full of little creaking and squeaking sounds. One heard the waves breaking and flapping against the side of the boat as if they were anchored in harbour. Everything became very close to one. For the sail, upon which James had his eyes fixed until it had become to him like a person whom he knew, sagged entirely; there they came to a stop, flapping about waiting for a breeze, in the hot sun, miles from shore, miles from the Lighthouse. Everything in the whole world seemed to stand still. The Lighthouse became immovable, and the line of the distant shore became fixed. The sun grew hotter and everybody seemed to come very close together and to feel each other's presence, which they had almost forgotten. Macalister's fishing line went plumb down into the sea. But Mr Ramsay went on reading with his legs curled under him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，她手的周围的涡流减弱了。水停止了急速的流动；世界充满了轻微的吱嘎声，可以听见海浪冲击和拍打船舷的声音，好像他们是停泊在港湾里。一切都似乎和人非常接近。詹姆斯两只眼睛一直盯着船帆，直盯得它变得像个熟人；这时这船帆完全耷拉了下来；船停了下来，在炎炎烈日下飘荡着等待起风；远离海岸，远离灯塔，世界上的一切似乎都静止不动了。灯塔变得岿然不动，远处的海岸线变得固定住了。太阳更毒，大家似乎挨得非常近，都能感到相互的存在，而刚才他们几乎忘记了别人。麦卡利斯特的钓鱼线笔直地落人水中。但是拉姆齐先生继续蜷腿坐着看他的书。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">He had always kept this old symbol of taking a knife and striking his father to the heart. Only now, impotent rage, it was not him, that old man reading, whom he wanted to kill, but it was the thing that descended on him -- without his knowing it perhaps: that fierce sudden black-winged harpy, with its talons and its beak all cold and hard, that struck and struck at you (he could feel the beak on his bare legs, where it had struck when he was a child) and then made off, and there he was again, an old man, very sad, reading his book. That he would kill, that he would strike to the heart. Whatever he did --(and he might do anything, he felt, looking at the Lighthouse and the distant shore) whether he was in a business, in a bank, a barrister, a man at the head of some enterprise, that he would fight, that he would track down and stamp out -- tyranny, despotism, he called it -- making people do what they did not want to do, cutting off their right to speak. How could any of them say, But I won't, when he said, Come to the Lighthouse. Do this. Fetch me that. The black wings spread, and the hard beak tore. And then next moment, there he sat reading his book; and he might look up -- one never knew -- quite reasonably. He might talk to the Macalisters. He might be pressing a sovereign into some frozen old woman's hand in the street, James thought, and he might be shouting out at some fisherman's sports; he might be waving his arms in the air with excitement. Or he might sit at the head of the table dead silent from one end of dinner to the other. Yes, thought James, while the boat slapped and dawdled there in the hot sun; there was a waste of snow and rock very lonely and austere; and there he had come to feel, quite often lately, when his father said something or did something which surprised the others, there were two pairs of footprints only; his own and his father's. They alone knew each other. What then was this terror, which the past had folded in him, peering into the heart of that forest where light and shade so chequer each other that all shape is distorted, and one blunders, now with the sun in one's eyes, now with a dark shadow, he sought an image to cool and detach and round off his feeling in a concrete shape. Suppose then that as a child sitting helpless in a perambulator, or on some one's knee, he had seen a waggon crush ignorantly and innocently, some one's foot? Suppose he had seen the foot first, in the grass, smooth, and whole; then the wheel; and the same foot, purple, crushed. But the wheel was innocent. So now, when his father came striding down the passage knocking them up early in the morning to go to the Lighthouse down it came over his foot, over Cam's foot, over anybody's foot. One sat and watched it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他脑海中一直保留着拿刀刺到他父亲心脏里去这个早已有之的象征。只有现在，在他长大了一些，坐在这里干生气地瞪着他父亲的时候，才意识到他想杀死的并不是他，不是那个看书的老头，而是落在他身上的那东西——也许他自己并不知道：那头凶猛迅速的黑翅膀大鹰怪，爪子和利喙冰冷坚硬，它一而再地向你袭击（他能感到它在啄他的光腿，他小的时候被啄过的地方），然后飞走，而他又恢复了原样，一个老头子、非常忧伤、读着他的书。那鹰怪是他要杀死的，他要拿刀直刺它的心脏。无论他做什么——（他看着灯塔和远处的海岸，感到自己什么都可能去做）不论是经商、在银行、当律师、做企业的经理，他都要斗争，都要追拿并消灭——他称做暴行和专制的现象——即让人干他们不想干的事情，剥夺他们说话的权利。当他说，“到灯塔去”的时候，他们谁能说“可是我不想去”？干这个。给我拿那个。黑色的翅膀张开了，坚硬的鸟嘴撕啄着。而随后他又坐在那里读起书来；他可能会通情达理地抬起头来——谁也说不准。他可能和麦卡利斯特父子聊天。他可能会在大街上把一个金币硬塞进某个冻僵了的老妇的手中，詹姆斯想；他可能在渔民的什么运动比赛上呐喊助威；他可能会因激动而挥舞胳膊。或者他可能坐在餐桌的一端，一顿饭从头到尾一声不吭。是的，小船在烈日下漂浮时詹姆斯心里在想；有这么一片极其荒凉严酷的覆盖着积雪和乱石的荒原；近来当他的父亲说了些什么令别人惊异的话时，他常常感到在那里只有两对足迹，他和父亲的。只有他们互相了解。那么这种恐惧，这种仇恨又是什么呢？他留连于往昔的岁月积存在心头的重重树叶层中，向树林深处窥探，那儿光与影交替变幻，扭曲了一切的形状，他在里面跌跌撞撞，一会儿是由于阳光刺目，一会儿是由于黑影难辨，极力想找到一个形象好使自己的感受冷却、超脱、以—个具体的形式得到圆满的表达。设想一下，也许就像一个幼童无助地坐在童车里，或某人的膝盖上，看见一辆马车不知不觉间压碎了一个人的脚？假设他先看见了脚，一只在草地上的、光滑的、完整的脚；然后他看见了车轮；然后同样的那只脚，已是被压碎了，一片紫红。但车轮是无罪的。因此现在当他父亲大清早大步沿走廊而来，敲门叫醒他们到灯塔去之时，那轮子就压过了他的脚，压过了卡姆的脚，压过了所有人的脚。他只能干坐在那里看着。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was reading a little shiny book with covers mottled like a plover's egg. Now and again, as they hung about in that horrid calm, he turned a page. And James felt that each page was turned with a peculiar gesture aimed at him; now assertively, now commandingly; now with the intention of making people pity him; and all the time, as his father read and turned one after another of those little pages, James kept dreading the moment when he would look up and speak sharply to him about something or other. Why were they lagging about here? he would demand, or something quite unreasonable like that. And if he does, James thought, then I shall take a knife and strike him to the heart.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他正在读一本亮亮的小书，封面有像鹬鸟蛋一样的杂色斑纹。当他们在那令人讨厌的风平浪静中进退不得之时，他却时不时地翻过一页书：詹姆斯觉得他翻动每一页书时那特别的动作都是冲他来的：时而间武断，时而命令；时而含有让人同情他的目的；在他父亲一页页翻读着那小小的书页的所有的时间里，詹姆斯一直害怕他会抬起头来对他厉声说些什么。他们为什么会滞留在这里？他会质问，或说些类似的不讲道理的话。詹姆斯想，如果他这样做，我就拿把刀刺到他心脏里去。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">But whose foot was he thinking of, and in what garden did all this happen? For one had settings for these scenes; trees that grew there; flowers; a certain light; a few figures. Everything tended to set itself in a garden where there was none of this gloom. None of this throwing of hands about; people spoke in an ordinary tone of voice. They went in and out all day long. There was an old woman gossiping in the kitchen; and the blinds were sucked in and out by the breeze; all was blowing, all was growing; and over all those plates and bowls and tall brandishing red and yellow flowers a very thin yellow veil would be drawn, like a vine leaf, at night. Things became stiller and darker at night. But the leaf-like veil was so fine, that lights lifted it, voices crinkled it; he could see through it a figure stooping, hear, coming close, going away, some dress rustling, some chain tinkling.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是他想到的是谁的脚，这一切又发生在哪个花园里？因为这类景象都得有个发生的场所；生长在那儿的树木；开放的鲜花；某种光线；几个人影。一切都倾向于发生在一个没有这类阴沉气氛、没有这种乱舞双手的花园里；人们用普通的口气说话。他们整天进进出出。有一个老太婆在厨房里碎嘴唠叨；风把遮帘吹得在窗子里飘进飘出；花儿盛开，万物生长；夜晚，在所有的碗碟之上，在长长的摇曳着的红色和黄色的鲜花之上会罩上一层极薄的黄纱，就像一片葡萄的叶子。夜晚一切都变得更静、更暗。但那叶子般的薄纱轻柔得光能将它掀起，声音能他它皱起；他能透过它看见一个弯着腰的身影，听到衣服的沙沙声、链条的叮当声，时而走近，时而远去。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was in this world that the wheel went over the person's foot. Something, he remembered, stayed flourished up in the air, something arid and sharp descended even there, like a blade, a scimitar, smiting through the leaves and flowers even of that happy world and making it shrivel and fall.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="正是在这样一个世界里车轮压过了那个人的脚。他记得有什么东西停留在他的头顶上方，它的影子笼罩着他；不肯离去：什么东西在空中活跃，什么干枯尖利的东西甚至落到了那里，像一柄剑，一把弯刀，击穿了甚至在那个幸福的世界里的树叶和鲜花，使它们干枯、凋零。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">James looked at the Lighthouse. He could see the white-washed rocks; the tower, stark and straight; he could see that it was barred with black and white; he could see windows in it; he could even see washing spread on the rocks to dry. So that was the Lighthouse, was it?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="詹姆斯看着灯塔。他可以看得见刷成白色的岩石；那座光秃秃地直立着的塔；他可以看见塔身上刷着黑白的粗道道；他可以看见上面的窗户；他甚至都能看见摊晒在岩石上的洗过的衣服。这么说来这就是那座灯塔了，是吧？">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But he pulled himself up. Whenever he said "they" or "a person," and then began hearing the rustle of some one coming, the tinkle of some one going, he became extremely sensitive to the presence of whoever might be in the room. It was his father now. The strain was acute. For in one moment if there was no breeze, his father would slap the covers of his book together, and say: "What's happening now? What are we dawdling about here for, eh?" as, once before he had brought his blade down among them on the terrace and she had gone stiff all over, and if there had been an axe handy, a knife, or anything with a sharp point he would have seized it and struck his father through the heart. She had gone stiff all over, and then, her arm slackening, so that he felt she listened to him no longer, she had risen somehow and gone away and left him there, impotent, ridiculous, sitting on the floor grasping a pair of scissors.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="但是他停止了遐想。每当他说“他们”或“一个人”，然后开始听到某人走来时衣服的沙沙声，某人走开时链条的叮当声，他便对留在房间里的无论什么人的存在变得极为敏感。现在是他的父亲。气氛变得极其紧张。因为如果还没有风的话，那么很快他的父亲就会啪地把书一合，说：“现在是怎么回事？我们为什么在这儿漂着不动啊？”就像以前有一次，他在平台上把利剑砍向了他和母亲，使她全身发僵，当时如果手边有把斧子、刀、或任何尖利的东西，他就会一把抓起直刺他父亲的心脏。他的母亲全身发僵，后来她的胳膊松弛了，他便感到她不再听他说话了，她仿佛不知怎地站起来走开了去，剩下他在那里，无能为力、滑稽可笑、坐在地板上抓看一把剪刀。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Not a breath of wind blew. The water chuckled and gurgled in the bottom of the boat where three or four mackerel beat their tails up and down in a pool of water not deep enough to cover them. At any moment Mr Ramsay (he scarcely dared look at him) might rouse himself, shut his book, and say something sharp; but for the moment he was reading, so that James stealthily, as if he were stealing downstairs on bare feet, afraid of waking a watchdog by a creaking board, went on thinking what was she like, where did she go that day? He began following her from room to room and at last they came to a room where in a blue light, as if the reflection came from many china dishes, she talked to somebody; he listened to her talking. She talked to a servant, saying simply whatever came into her head. She alone spoke the truth; to her alone could he speak it. That was the source of her everlasting attraction for him, perhaps; she was a person to whom one could say what came into one's head. But all the time he thought of her, he was conscious of his father following his thought, surveying it, making it shiver and falter. At last he ceased to think.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没有一丝风。海水在船底发出扑突扑突的声音，三四条马鲛鱼在浅得没不住它们身子的水里拍打着尾巴。任何时候拉姆齐先生（詹姆斯几乎不敢看他）都可能惊醒过来，合上书，说出什么刺耳的话来；但是暂时他仍在看书，于是詹姆斯继续悄悄地接着回想，她是什么模样，那天她去了哪里？他悄悄地想着，仿佛他光着脚偷偷走下楼去，生怕踩上一块吱嘎响的地板而惊醒了看门狗。他开始跟在她后面从一间屋于到又一间屋子，最后来到了一间光线是蓝色的屋子里，仿佛是从许多瓷盘子上反射出来的光，她在那里和什么人说话；他听着她说话。她和一个仆人说话，想到什么说什么。“我们今晚会需要一个大盘子。放在哪儿了——那只蓝颜色的盘子？”只有她才说实话；他也只有对她一个人才说实话。也许这就是她对他有着永恒的吸引力的源泉；她是一个你可以把想到的什么话都告诉她的人。但是在他想到她的时候，他一直都意识到他的父亲在追随着他的思路，盯它的梢，使它颤抖、犹豫。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">There he sat with his hand on the tiller in the sun, staring at the Lighthouse, powerless to move, powerless to flick off these grains of misery which settled on his mind one after another. A rope seemed to bind him there, and his father had knotted it and he could only escape by taking a knife and plunging it… But at that moment the sail swung slowly round, filled slowly out, the boat seemed to shake herself, and then to move off half conscious in her sleep, and then she woke and shot through the waves. The relief was extraordinary. They all seemed to fall away from each other again and to be the side of the boat. But his father did not rouse himself. He only raised his right hand mysteriously high in the air, and let it fall upon his knee again as if he were conducting some secret symphony.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="最后他停止了回忆；他坐在阳光下，手放在舵柄上，眼望着灯塔，没有力量移动，没有力量拂去一颗接一颗落在他心上的痛苦的微粒。似乎有一根绳子把他捆在那里，是他的父亲打的结，他只有拿把刀刺穿它才能逃脱……但就在那一刻船帆慢慢转了过来，渐渐被风鼓起，小船似乎抖了抖身子，然后半睡半醒地开始航行，随后她完全醒了过来，飞速破浪而去。这份轻松的感觉真是太美妙了：他们之间的距离似乎又加大了，感到自在舒畅，从船侧斜抛下的钓鱼线又绷紧了起来。但他父亲并没有被惊动，他只是神秘地高举起右手，然后又让它落间到膝盖上，仿佛在指挥着什么秘密的交响乐。">查看中文翻译</div>
