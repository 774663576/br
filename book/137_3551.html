What difference does it make to you if I am here when your eyes are closed! Now I am going. Stay, I have placed myself behind the wall. You can open your eyes again."</div>

<div class="line_en">On the following morning, she perceived on awaking, that she had been asleep. This singular thing astonished her. She had been so long unaccustomed to sleep! A joyous ray of the rising sun entered through her window and touched her face. At the same time with the sun, she beheld at that window an object which frightened her, the unfortunate face of Quasimodo. She involuntarily closed her eyes again, but in vain; she fancied that she still saw through the rosy lids that gnome's mask, one-eyed and gap-toothed. Then, while she still kept her eyes closed, she heard a rough voice saying, very gently,—</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="第二天早晨，她醒来才发现自己睡了一觉，真不寻常，她吃了一惊。她早已失去了睡眠的习惯！欢乐的朝阳从窗洞里射进光芒，直接照在她的脸上。与阳光同时，她看见窗洞里有一样吓人的东西，那就是卡席莫多的丑脸。她不由自主地紧闭双目，可是无效。她好像总是透过粉红色的眼睑看见了这张缺牙豁齿、一只眼睛的地鬼似的丑脸。于是，她始终闭着眼睛，听见一个粗嗓门十分温柔地说：">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There was something more plaintive than these words, and that was the accent in which they were uttered. The gypsy, much touched, opened her eyes. He was, in fact, no longer at the window. She approached the opening, and beheld the poor hunchback crouching in an angle of the wall, in a sad and resigned attitude. She made an effort to surmount the repugnance with which he inspired her. "Come," she said to him gently. From the movement of the gypsy's lips, Quasimodo thought that she was driving him away; then he rose and retired limping, slowly, with drooping head, without even daring to raise to the young girl his gaze full of despair. "Do come," she cried, but he continued to retreat. Then she darted from her cell, ran to him, and grasped his arm. On feeling her touch him, Quasimodo trembled in every limb. He raised his suppliant eye, and seeing that she was leading him back to her quarters, his whole face beamed with joy and tenderness. She tried to make him enter the cell; but he persisted in remaining on the threshold. "No, no," said he; "the owl enters not the nest of the lark."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="还有比这几句话更凄惨的，那就是说话的声调。埃及姑娘心里感动，就把眼睛睁开了。他确实已不在窗洞口。她走到窗口，只见可怜的驼子在墙角里，以痛苦、顺从的姿态缩成一团。她勉为其难克制住对他的厌恶，温存地说道：“过来！”卡席莫多从她嘴唇动作上猜测，以为她是要赶他走，就站起身来，一拐一瘸，缓缓退出，搭拉着脑袋，甚至不敢把伤心绝望的眼睛抬起来望望姑娘。她又叫了一声：“过来呀！”但是，他继续远去。于是，她冲出小室，跑过去抓住他的胳臂。卡席莫多感觉到她的手，浑身哆嗦起来。他抬头以恳求的目光看看她，明白了她是要把他拽到身边去，不由得柔情满怀，高兴得容光焕发了。她要他进她的小室去，他却坚持留在门槛上。他说：“不，不，夜猫子不可以进百灵鸟的窝。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Then she crouched down gracefully on her couch, with her goat asleep at her feet. Both remained motionless for several moments, considering in silence, she so much grace, he so much ugliness. Every moment she discovered some fresh deformity in Quasimodo. Her glance travelled from his knock knees to his humped back, from his humped back to his only eye. She could not comprehend the existence of a being so awkwardly fashioned. Yet there was so much sadness and so much gentleness spread over all this, that she began to become reconciled to it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="于是，她以优美的姿态斜倚在床垫上，山羊睡在她脚下。两人一时无话，静静地对视着，一个眼里所见是风流俊俏，另一个眼里所见是丑陋无比。她随时都发现卡席莫多身上又增添了新的畸形。她的目光从他的罗圈腿看到他的驼背，从驼背又看到独眼。她不能理解怎么可能存在着塑造得这样笨拙的一个生物。然而，他的一切又包含着那样深刻的忧伤和温柔，她也就开始适应了。">查看中文翻译</div>

Tell me, I must look to you like a beast. You, you are a ray of sunshine, a drop of dew, the song of a bird! I am something frightful, neither man nor animal, I know not what, harder, more trampled under foot, and more unshapely than a pebble stone!"</div>

<div class="line_en">There lay in the accents of the wretched man so profound a consciousness of his misery, that she had not the strength to say a word. Besides, he would not have heard her. He went on,—</div>

<div class="line_en">Then he began to laugh, and that laugh was the most heartbreaking thing in the world. He continued,— "Yes, I am deaf; but you shall talk to me by gestures, by signs. I have a master who talks with me in that way. And then, I shall very soon know your wish from the movement of your lips, from your look."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="说着，他大笑起来，这笑声真是世上最使人心碎的声音；接着他又说：“是的，我是聋子，可是您可以用动作和姿势和我说话；我有个主人，他就是像这样跟我交谈的。而且，从您嘴唇的动作和眼神上，我很快就可以懂得您的意思。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I understand," he replied. "You ask me why I saved you. You have forgotten a wretch who tried to abduct you one night, a wretch to whom you rendered succor on the following day on their infamous pillory.

<div class="line_cn" title="“不，不，”他说，“我不应该呆得太久。您瞅着我，我浑身都不自在。您不掉过脸去，只是出于怜悯。我去找个地方呆着，看得见您而您看不见我。那样好些。”">查看中文翻译</div>
