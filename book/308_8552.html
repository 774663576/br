<div class="line_en">On this particular night our guests were Miss Gannett and Colonel Carter, who lives near the church. A good deal of gossip is handed round at these evenings, sometimes seriously interfering with the game in progress. We used to play bridge -- chatty bridge of the worst description. We find Mah Jong much more peaceful. The irritated demand as to why on earth your partner did not lead a certain card is entirely done away with, and though we still express criticisms frankly, there is not the same acrimonious spirit.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Very cold evening, eh, Sheppard?" said Colonel Carter, standing with his back to the fire. Caroline had taken Miss Gannett to her own room, and was there assisting her to disentangle herself from her many wraps. "Reminds me of the Afghan passes."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“今晚真冷，是吧，谢泼德？”背靠壁炉的卡特上校说。卡洛琳把甘尼特小姐带进自己房间，正帮她脱下裹了一层又一层的外衣。“勾起了我对阿富汗的回忆。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">That night we had a little Mah Jong party. This kind of simple entertainment is very popular in King's Abbot. The guests arrive in goloshes and waterproofs after dinner. They partake of coffee and later of cake, sandwiches and tea.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Very mysterious business this about poor Ackroyd," continued the colonel, accepting a cup of coffee. "A deuce of a lot behind it -- that's what I say. Between you and me, Sheppard, I've heard the word blackmail mentioned!" The colonel gave me the look which might be tabulated "one man of the world to another."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“可怜的艾克罗伊德，真是一场神秘的谋杀，”上校边接过咖啡边说，“背后大有玄机——我是这么看的。谢泼德，有句话我只对你说，我听说跟勒索有关呢！”上校意味深长地看了我一眼，那意思是“天知地知你知我知”。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Washing the tiles," said the colonel facetiously. "That's right -- washing the tiles, as we used to say in the Shanghai Club."</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“毫无疑问，还牵涉到一个女人，”他说，“信不信由你，一定跟女人有关。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It is the private opinion of both Caroline and myself that Colonel Carter has never been in the Shanghai Club in his life. More, that he has never been farther east than India, where he juggled with tins of bully beef and plum and apple jam during the Great War. But the colonel is determinedly military, and in King's Abbot we permit people to indulge their little idiosyncrasies freely.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="卡洛琳和我都认为，卡特上校这辈子根本就没去过上海的俱乐部。大战期间他在印度做牛肉罐头、梅子酱和苹果酱生意，没去过印度再往东的地方。不过上校的军旅生涯是货真价实的，何况在金斯艾伯特，就算你再怎么吹嘘自己的离奇经历，大家也都买账。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I discarded a tile. A round or two proceeded, broken by the monotonous remarks of "Three Bamboos," "Two Circles," "Pung," and frequently from Miss Gannett "Unpung," owing to that lady's habit of too hastily claiming tiles to which she had no right.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="我打出一张牌。一两圈过后，沉闷的气氛渐渐被单调的喊声打破，“三条”“二筒”“碰”，甘尼特小姐时不时还喊“不碰”，因为她有个习惯，没看清牌就抢着“碰”，然后才发现碰不起。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"We're waiting for you to discard. Miss Caroline," said the colonel. He sometimes affects the pose of the bluff male, intent on the game and indifferent to gossip. But nobody is deceived.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“都等你出牌呢，卡洛琳小姐。”上校说。他有时会摆出大男人的派头，看似专注于牌局，对小道消息漠不关心，但谁都不会上他的当。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"If you ask me," said Miss Gannett. "Was that a Bamboo you discarded, dear? Oh! no, I see now -- it was a Circle. As I was saying, if you ask me. Flora's been exceedingly lucky. Exceedingly lucky she's been."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“要我说啊，”甘尼特小姐说，“你刚才打的是条子吗，亲爱的？哦，不，我看见了——是筒子。要我说啊，弗洛拉真是走运，运气好得不能再好了。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“这话怎么说，甘尼特小姐？”上校问，“那张发财我碰。你怎么看出弗洛拉小姐运气好？她确实是个漂亮姑娘。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I mayn't know very much about crime," said Miss Gannett, with the air of one who knows everything there is to know, "but I can tell you one thing. The first question that's always asked is "Who last saw the deceased alive?" And the person who did is regarded with suspicion. Now, Flora Ackroyd last saw her uncle alive. It might have looked very nasty for her -- very nasty indeed. It's my opinion -- and I give it for what it's worth, that Ralph Paton is staying away on her account, to draw suspicion away from her."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“犯罪这种事我或许不算太懂，”甘尼特小姐以一种万事通的口吻说，“但我可以告诉你，警察一开头总要问‘最后看见死者活着的人是谁？’而这个人总会成为怀疑对象。好了，弗洛拉·艾克罗伊德是最后看见她伯父还活着的人，这对她很不利——非常非常不利。依我看——管它三七二十一，拉尔夫·佩顿躲起来就是掩护她，分散她的嫌疑。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“唔，很难说，”甘尼特小姐说，“这两天我从图书馆借了本书，里头说在巴黎下层社会，有些最凶残的罪犯就是漂亮的年轻姑娘。”">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">"Chow," said Miss Gannett. "Quite wonderful for our little village, I'm sure. By the way, Clara -- my maid, you know is great friends with Elsie, the housemaid at Fernly, and what do you think Elsie told her? That there's been a lot of money stolen, and it's her opinion -- Elsie's -- I mean, that the parlourmaid had something to do with it. She's leaving at the month, and she's crying a good deal at night. If you ask me, the girl is very likely in league with a gang. She's always been a queer girl -- she's not friends with any of the girls round here. She goes off by herself on her days out very unnatural, I call it, and most suspicious. I asked her once to come to our Friendly Girls' Evenings, but she refused, and then I asked her a few questions about her home and her family -- all that sort of thing, and I'm bound to say I considered her manner most impertinent. Outwardly very respectful -- but she shut me up in the most barefaced way."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“吃。”甘尼特小姐说，“我们这种小村子，难得来个大人物。对了，克拉拉——就是我那个女仆，你也认识——跟芬利庄园的女佣埃尔西关系很好，你们猜猜埃尔西告诉她什么来着？丢了一大笔钱。而且她认为——我是指埃尔西认为——那个客厅女仆手脚肯定不干净。她这个月就要卷铺盖走人了，天天半夜哭个没完。要我说，她很可能和什么犯罪团伙有关系。那姑娘的性子很古怪，在村里一个朋友也没有，每次轮休都单独出门——我看这就很不正常，非常可疑。有一次我邀请她来参加女孩子们的联谊晚会，被她拒绝了；然后我又问她家住哪儿，家里都有谁，诸如此类；我不得不说，她的态度特别傲慢。表面上礼数周全，但她居然当场拒绝了我的邀请，真是无礼到了极点。”">查看中文翻译</div>
