<div class="line_en">May Belle was as scrawny as Brenda was fat. She stood a moment in the middle of the floor in her underwear, her skin white and goose-bumpy. Her eyes were still drooped from sleep, and her pale brown hair stuck up all over her head like a squirrel's nest on a winter branch. That's got to be the world's ugliest kid, he thought, looking her over with genuine affection.</div>

<div class="line_en">The shed was filled with Miss Bessie's familiar smell. He clucked her gently over and set his stool at her flank and the pail beneath her speckled udder. The rain pounded the metal roof of the shed so that the plink of milk in the pail set up a counter-rhythm. If only it would stop raining. He pressed his forehead against Miss Bessie's warm hide. He wondered idly if cows were ever scared -- really scared. He had seen Miss Bessie jitter away from P. T., but that was different. A yapping puppy at your heels is an immediate threat, but the difference between him and Miss Bessie was that when there was no P. T. in sight she was perfectly content, sleepily chewing her cud. She wasn't staring down at the old Perkins place, wondering and worrying. She wasn't standing there on her tippytoes while anxiety ate holes through all her stomachs.</div>

<div class="line_en">He stroked his forehead across her flank and sighed. If there was still water in the creek come summer, he'd ask Leslie to teach him how to swim. How's that? he said to himself. I'll just grab that old terror by the shoulders and shake the daylights out of it. Maybe I'll even learn scuba diving. He shuddered. He may not have been born with guts, but he didn't have to die without them. Hey, maybe you could go down to the Medical College and get a gut transplant. No, Doc, I got me a perfectly good heart. What I need is a gut transplant. How 'bout it? He smiled. He'd have to tell Leslie about wanting a gut transplant. It was the kind of nonsense she appreciated. Of course -- he broke the rhythm of the milking long enough to shove his hair out of his face -- of course what I really need is a brain transplant. I know Leslie. I know she's not going to bite my head off or make fun of me if I say I don't want to go across again till the creek's down. All I gotta do is say "Leslie, I don't wanta go over there today." Just like that. Easy as pie. "Leslie, I don't want to go over there today."</div>

<div class="line_en">As soon as he saw her car turn in, Jess raced out the kitchen door through the rain and met her halfway up the drive. His mother could find out the details from May Belle after he was safely up the road. He was glad May Belle was absorbed in the TV. He didn't want her waking Momma up before he got away.

<div class="line_en">It didn't occur to him until the car was past Millsburg that he might have asked Miss Edmunds if Leslie could have come, too. When he thought about it, he couldn't suppress a secret pleasure at being alone in this small cozy car with Miss Edmunds. She drove intently, both hands gripping the top of the wheel, peering forward. The wheels hummed and the windshield wipers slicked a merry rhythm. The car was warm and filled with the smell of Miss Edmunds. Jess sat with his hands clasped between his knees, the seat belt tight across his chest.</div>

<div class="line_en">Even in the rain he could make out the landmarks, looking surprisingly the way the books had pictured them -- the Lee Mansion high on the hill, the bridge, and twice around the circle, so he could get a good look at Abraham Lincoln looking out across the city, the White House and the Monument and at the other end the Capitol. Leslie had seen all these places a million times. She had even gone to school with a girl whose father was a congressman. He thought he might tell Miss Edmunds later that Leslie was a personal friend of a real congressman. Miss Edmunds had always liked Leslie.</div>

<div class="line_en">Entering the gallery was like stepping inside the pine grove -- the huge vaulted marble, the cool splash of the fountain, and the green growing all around. Two little children had pulled away from their mothers and were running about, screaming to each other. It was all Jess could do not to grab them and tell them how to behave in so obviously a sacred place.</div>

<div class="line_en">And then the pictures -- room after room, floor after floor. He was drunk with color and form and hugeness -- and with the voice and perfume of Miss Edmunds always beside him.

Men would stare at her instead of the pictures, and Jess felt they must be jealous of him for being with her.</div>

<div class="line_en">They ate a late lunch in the cafeteria. When she mentioned lunch, he realized with horror that he would need money, and he didn't know how to tell her that he hadn't brought any -- didn't have any to bring, for that matter.

<div class="line_en">After lunch, they trotted through the drizzle to the Smithsonian to see the dinosaurs and the Indians. There they came upon a display case holding a miniature scene of Indians disguised in buffalo skins scaring a herd of buffalo into stampeding over a cliff to their death with more Indians waiting below to butcher and skin them. It was a three-dimensional nightmare version of some of his own drawings. He felt a frightening sense of kinship with it.</div>

<div class="line_en">He felt good again. All the way home in the sunshine Miss Edmunds told funny stories about going to college one year in Japan, where all the boys had been shorter than she, and she hadn't known how to use the toilets.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他又觉得愉快起来。在整个回家的路上他们都沐浴在阳光之中。艾徳梦丝小姐一直在给他讲一些日本留学一年期间发生的好玩事，那里所有的男孩儿都比她矮，而且在那里她一开始都不知道怎么使用厕所。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">One dip in the road before the old Perkins place, he said, "Just let me out at the road, Miss Edmunds. Don't try to turn in. You might get stuck in the mud."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="刚刚转进通向帕金斯老宅的路时，他说：“就让我在这下车吧，艾徳梦丝小姐。不用拐进去了，车子可能会陷进泥里。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He relaxed. He had so much to tell Leslie and ask her. It didn't matter how angry his mother was. She'd get over it. And it was worth it. This one perfect day of his life was worth anything he had to pay.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他放松下来。他有太多的东西要告诉莱斯利，要问她。他妈妈会多么的愤怒已经无所谓了。她会把这事忘了的。而且这也是值得的。他生命中这完美的一天值得他付出任何代价。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Wow!" Miss Edmunds said. "A miracle! Behold the sun! I was beginning to think she had gone into a cave and vowed never to return, like the Japanese myth."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“哇！”艾徳梦丝小姐说，“这真是个奇迹！看那太阳！我以为她躲进了一个山洞里，发誓再也不出来了呢。就像日本神话里讲的。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The western sun danced on the windshield dazzling his eyes. He turned and looked Miss Edmunds full in the face. "No, ma'am." His voice sounded squeaky and strange. He cleared his throat. "No ma'am, thank you. Well --" He hated to leave without being able to really thank her, but the words were not coming for him now. Later, of course, they would, when he was lying in bed or sitting in the castle. "Well --" He opened the door and got out. "See you next Friday."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="自西而来的阳光在挡风玻璃上跳动着，闪得他眼花。他转过头去看着艾徳梦丝小姐的脸。“不用谢，女士。”他的声音听起来有点尖锐怪异，于是他清了清嗓子。“不用谢，女士，谢谢您。那么——”他不想就这样，还没有真正道谢就离开，但他就是找不到恰当的词。当然啦，待会儿当他躺在床上或是坐在城堡里时，这些词会找上他的。“那么——”他把车门打开然后跳了下去，“周五见。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"OK, Jess," she said. She pulled over at his road. "Thank you for a beautiful day."</div>

<div class="line_en">Suddenly his mother let out a great shuddering sob. "O my God. O my God." She said it over and over, her head down on her arms. His father moved to put his arm around her awkwardly, but he didn't take his eyes off Jess.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="，他妈妈突然爆发出一阵颤抖的抽泣。“哦，我的天啊。哦，我的天啊。”她翻来覆去地说，头埋在胳膊里。他爸爸走过去笨拙的搂住了她，却没有把目光从杰斯身上移开。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He was all the way into the kitchen before he realized that something was wrong. His dad's pickup had been outside the door, but he hadn't taken it in until he came into the room and found them all sitting there: his parents and the little girls at the kitchen table and Ellie and Brenda on the couch. Not eating. There was no food on the table. Not watching TV. It wasn't even turned on. He stood unmoving for a second while they stared at him.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="直到进了厨房他才发现不对劲。他爸爸的小卡车停在门口，但他并没有在意。他进了房间，发现他们都坐在那里：他父母，餐桌旁的小女孩儿，还有沙发上的艾丽和布兰达。不是在吃饭，因为餐桌上根本就没有吃的东西；没有看电视，因为电视甚至根本就没开。他呆立在那里一动不动，而他们则盯着他看。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">He watched the car go out of sight and then turned and ran with all his might to the house, the joy jiggling inside of him so hard that he wouldn't have been surprised if his feet had just taken off from the ground the way they sometimes did in dreams and floated him right over the roof.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他目送着车子远去，然后转过身，用尽全身的力气跑向他家。快乐在他体内激烈地冲撞，以至于即使像梦里一样飞起来，飘到屋顶上，他也不会感到奇怪。">查看中文翻译</div>
