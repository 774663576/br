<div class="line_en">She handed him an envelope and Philip recognised Griffiths' bold, legible writing. There were eight pages. It was well written, frank and charming; it was the letter of a man who was used to making love to women. He told Mildred that he loved her passionately, he had fallen in love with her the first moment he saw her; he did not want to love her, for he knew how fond Philip was of her, but he could not help himself. Philip was such a dear, and he was very much ashamed of himself, but it was not his fault, he was just carried away. He paid her delightful compliments. Finally he thanked her for consenting to lunch with him next day and said he was dreadfully impatient to see her. Philip noticed that the letter was dated the night before; Griffiths must have written it after leaving Philip, and had taken the trouble to go out and post it when Philip thought he was in bed.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她递给菲利普一个信封，上面正是格里菲斯苍劲、清晰的笔迹。信一共八页，句句动情、字字感人，一看就是周旋于女人中的情场老手。他告诉米尔德里德自己多么爱她，几乎对她一见钟情，也知道菲利普对她一往情深，所以不想让自己爱上她，可是控制不住。菲利普是那么好的人，又常自卑，但这不是他的错，他不过是一个坠入爱河的可怜人。格里菲斯甜言蜜语地夸了她好几句。最后，他感谢米尔德里德答应自己共赴明天的午餐，说已经等不及要见她。菲利普注意到这封信的日期是昨晚，也就是说这是格里菲斯在和菲利普道别后才写的信，又不怕麻烦地大晚上跑出来寄走。菲利普还傻乎乎地觉得他那时已经上床休息了呢。">查看中文翻译</div>
