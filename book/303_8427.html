<div class="line_en">All the work you've done in the last three chapters -- the exercises, the checklists, and gaining understanding of who is really responsible -- has been preparing you for confrontation. Confrontation means facing your parents thoughtfully and courageously about your painful past and your difficult present. It is the most frightening and at the same time the most empowering act that you will ever perform.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The process is simple, though not easy. When you are ready, you calmly but firmly tell your parents about the negative events you remember from your childhood. You tell them how those events affected your life and how they affect your relationship with your parents now. You clearly define the aspects of that relationship that are painful and harmful to you now. Then you lay out new ground rules.</div>

<div class="line_en">It is absolutely true that confrontation may not get your parents to give you the acknowledgment, apology, recognition, or acceptance of responsibility that you seek. It is a rare toxic parent who will respond to a confrontation by saying, "It's all true, I was terrible to you," or, "Please forgive me," or, "What can I do to make it up to you now?"</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Many people -- including some prominent therapists -- do not believe in confrontation. Their rationales are quite familiar: "Don't look backward, look forward"; "It will only cause more stress and anger"; or, "It doesn't heal wounds, it just reopens them." These critics simply don't understand.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">If you have already attempted to confront your parents but were bitterly disappointed by the outcome, you probably gauged the success of your confrontation by whether you got a positive response from your parents. By using their response as an indicator, you set yourself up for failure. You should expect them to react negatively. Remember, you are doing this for yourself, not for them. You should consider your confrontation successful simply because you had the courage to do it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In fact, just the opposite often occurs: parents deny, claim to have forgotten, project the blame back on their child, and get very angry.</div>

<div class="line_en">We're all afraid to face the truth about our parents. We're all afraid to acknowledge that we didn't get what we needed from them and that we're not going to get it now. But the alternative to confrontation is to live with these fears. If you avoid taking positive action on your own behalf, you're reinforcing your feelings of helplessness and inadequacy, you're undermining your self-respect.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I push people very hard to confront toxic parents. I do this for one simple reason: confrontation works. Through the years I've seen confrontations make dramatic, positive changes in the lives of thousands of people. This doesn't mean I don't appreciate how frightened people feel when they even think about confronting their parents. The emotional stakes are high. But the mere fact that you're doing it, that you're facing what are probably some of your deepest fears, is enough to begin to change the balance of power between you and your parents.</div>

<div class="line_en">I told Glenn -- who had problems with timidity and who regretted having taken his alcoholic father into business with him -- that he needed to confront his father. He needed either to set limits on his father's behavior or to get him out of the business altogether. He responded with a classic "anything but that":</div>

<div class="line_en">I am not going to confront my father. I know that means I'm being a wimp, but I do not want to cause my parents any more pain. I'm sure there are plenty of things I can do instead of confronting my father. I can find a job for him with less pressure where he won't be in front of my customers as much. I can stop letting him get to me. I can start exercising more to let off steam. I can…</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I told Glenn that much of his irritability and timidity were a direct result of his repressed rage toward his father and his unwillingness to take personal responsibility for confronting his difficulties. I acknowledged that most people respond with "anything but that" early in therapy and assured him that I did not find it discouraging. He simply wasn't ready. But once we had some time to plan the confrontation and to practice it, I was sure he'd feel more confident.</div>

Glenn acknowledged that confrontation had worked for these people, but he was quick to add that his situation was different. Without realizing it, Glenn had moved closer to the second stage of his confrontation decision.</div>

<div class="line_en">Glenn was hoping I could conjure up some magic itinerary to tell him when his anxiety level would drop enough for him to go through with his confrontation. The truth is, quite often your anxiety level drops only after the confrontation. There's no way to determine a perfect time, you just have to be prepared.</div>

<div class="line_en">About six weeks into group, Glenn told me that he had started thinking about confrontation. For the first time, he admitted that it was a possibility… for the future. He had arrived at stage 2. A few weeks later, he asked me when I thought he should do it. Stage 3.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In the course of his therapy Glenn worked very hard to learn both nondefensive responses and position statements. He had begun to use both these techniques in business situations and with some of his friends. He was feeling good about it. But the constant stress of the day-to-day relationship with his father and the enormous weight of the unfinished business from his childhood were bogging him down.</div>

<div class="line_en">I told Glenn that it was important for him to set a date for his confrontation, hopefully in this century. He needed to give himself a tangible goal to work toward.

<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">This last point is especially important. If you are still carrying the responsibility of the traumas of your childhood, it is too soon to confront. You cannot confront your parents with a responsibility you are not convinced they deserve.</div>

<div class="line_en">How Do I Confront My Parents?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I am a big advocate of writing as a therapeutic technique. A letter provides a wonderful opportunity to organize what you want to say and to rework it until you're satisfied. It gives the recipient a chance to read it over more than once and to reflect on the contents. A letter is also safer if you're dealing with a potentially violent parent. Confrontation is important, but it's never worth risking physical assault.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Always write a separate letter to each parent. Even if some of the issues are the same, your relationship with and your feelings for each parent are different. Write your first letter to the parent you think is the more toxic or abusive. Those feelings will be closer to the surface, more easily tapped. Once you have opened the floodgates by writing the first letter -- assuming both your parents are alive -- your feelings toward the other parent will flow more easily. In your second letter, you can confront the more benign of your parents with his or her passivity and lack of protection.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Confrontation can be done either face-to-face or by letter. You will notice that I do not include the telephone as an option. While it may seem safe, confrontation by phone is almost always ineffective. It's too easy for your parents to hang up. In addition, the telephone is "artificial"; it makes true emotional expression very difficult. If your parents are in another city and it is not practical for them to come to you or for you to go to them, write to them.</div>

<div class="line_en">Carol -- whose father continually taunted her about smelling bad -- decided she felt ready to confront her parents at a time when a large decorating job prevented her from going East to do it face-to-face. I assured her she could have an effective confrontation by letter. I suggested that she write the letter at home, during a quiet time, with the phone off the hook to prevent interruption.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Writing confrontation letters is always an intense emotional experience. Before sending her letter, I suggested that Carol put it aside for several days, then reread it when she was calmer. As most people do, she wound up rewriting quite a bit when she came back to her letter. You may find yourself writing several drafts before you're satisfied. Remember, you are not in an essay contest. The letter doesn't have to be a literary masterpiece -- it needs only to express the truth of your feelings and experiences.</div>

When I was about eleven, you became very cruel to me. You constantly told me I smelled bad. You blamed me for everything that went wrong. You blamed me when I lost the scholarship. You blamed me when Bob [her brother] fell and hurt himself. You blamed me when my leg got broken. You blamed me when Mom left you for a while. When Mom left, I was left without any emotional support. You told me jokes that were too dirty, talked about how sexy I looked in a sweater, and either treated me like a date or told me I looked like a whore.</div>

Your therapist can orchestrate the confrontation, make sure you get heard, help you if you get stuck, and, most important, be supportive and protective. I realize this stacks the deck against your parents, but better against them than against you, especially at such a crucial point in your work.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Many of my clients prefer the safety of writing letters, but many others need immediate feedback to feel that their confrontation was a success. For these clients, only a face-to-face confrontation will do.</div>

<div class="line_en">If you have a choice, I advise you to set the confrontation in your own home. You will feel much stronger on your own turf. If you travel to another city for your confrontation, try to get your parents to come to your hotel room.</div>

<div class="line_en">You may prefer to do your confrontation on your own. Perhaps you don't have a therapist -- or, if you do, you may feel the need to show your parents that you can assert your independence without help. Many parents simply refuse to go to a therapist's office. For whatever reason, if you decide to do it on your own, you have to decide whether to confront your parents in their home or in yours. A public place, such as a restaurant or a bar, is much too inhibiting. You need total privacy.</div>

<div class="line_en">You can have an effective confrontation on your parents' turf if necessary. But you will have to work hard to avoid falling victim to childhood fears, guilts, and feelings of helplessness. You should be especially wary of these childhood feelings if your parents still live in the house you grew up in.</div>

<div class="line_en">I have no hard and fast rule about whether to confront your parents together or separately, though my preference is to do it together. Toxic parents set up family systems that rely on a great deal of secrecy, collusion, and denial to keep the family in balance. Talking to both parents at once cuts through a great deal of that.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Some people are concerned about rehearsing too much and losing their spontaneity before the confrontation. Don't worry. You'll have enough anxiety to ensure plenty of deviations from what you've prepared. No matter how much you've rehearsed, the words won't come easily. In fact, it's essential that you know ahead of time that you will be very, very nervous. Your heart will pound, your stomach may knot, you may sweat, you may have a hard time catching your breath, and you may get tongue-tied and forget your lines.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">On the other hand, if your parents have greatly differing dispositions, perspectives, or defenses, you may be better able to communicate by taking them on one at a time.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Some people's minds just go blank under extreme pressure. If you're worried about this happening, you can avoid the added anxiety by writing a letter to your parents and then reading it aloud to them in your confrontation. This is an excellent way to defeat opening-night jitters and assure that you'll get your message across.</div>

<div class="line_en">No matter where you decide to have your confrontation, and no matter whether you confront your parents separately or together, you must carefully prepare what you want to say. Rehearse your lines out loud, either alone or with someone, until you know them cold. A face-to-face confrontation is like opening night on Broadway: would you go on stage without learning your lines and understanding your motivation? Before making your confrontation, you need both adequate rehearsal and a clear sense of what you wish to accomplish.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">You'll want to start your confrontation by setting the rules. I suggest something like this:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I'm going to say some things to you that I've never said before, and I want you to agree to hear me out until I'm done. This is very important to me, so please don't contradict me or interrupt me. After I've said what I need to say, you'll have all the time you want to say what you need to say. Are you willing to do that?</div>

<div class="line_en">Preparing for Opening Night</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It is essential that your parents agree to these terms at the outset. Most parents will. If they are not willing to do even this much, it is probably better to reschedule the confrontation. It is important for you to say what you have rehearsed without getting sidetracked, interrupted, or otherwise diverted from your goals. If they refuse to hear you out, you may have to confront them by letter instead.</div>

<div class="line_en">Inadequate or deficient parents may become even more pathetic and overwhelmed. Alcoholics may deny their alcoholism more vehemently, or if they are in recovery they may use that fact to try to undercut your right to confront them. Controllers may escalate their guilt-peddling and self-righteousness. Abusive parents may become enraged and will almost certainly try to blame you for your own abuse. All of these behaviors are in the service of regaining family balance and returning you to a submissive status quo. It is a good idea to expect the worst -- anything better is a bonus.</div>

<div class="line_en">To help yourself prepare, envision the worst possible scenario. Visualize your parents' faces, furious, pitiful, tearful, whatever. Hear their angry words, their denials, their accusations. Desensitize yourself by saying out loud whatever you think your parents will say, then rehearse calm, nondefensive responses. Ask a partner or friend to play the role of one or both parents. Tell him or her to pull out all the stops and say the worst things imaginable to you. Have your substitute parent scream, yell, call you names, threaten to cut you out of the family, and accuse you of being horrible and selfish. Practice answering with such lines as:</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It never happened." Parents who have used denial to avoid their own feelings of inadequacy or anxiety will undoubtedly use it during confrontation to promote their version of reality. They'll insist that your allegations never happened, or that you're exaggerating, or that your father could never have done such a thing. They won't remember, or they'll accuse you of lying. This reaction is especially common for alcoholics, whose denials may be reinforced by drink-induced memory lapses.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"It was your fault." Toxic parents are almost never willing to accept responsibility for their destructive behavior. Instead, they'll blame you. They'll say that you were bad or that you were difficult. They'll claim they did the best they could but you always created problems for them. They'll say that you drove them crazy. They'll offer as proof the fact that everybody in the family knew what a problem you were. They'll offer up a laundry list of your alleged offenses against them.</div>

<div class="line_en">A variation on this theme is to blame the confrontation on current difficulties in your life. "Why are you attacking us, when your real problem is that you can't hold a job, control your child, keep a husband, etc." This may even come disguised as sympathy for the turmoil you are experiencing. Anything to deflect the focus from their behavior.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I said I was sorry." Parents may promise to change, to become more loving, to be more supportive, but that's often just a carrot on a stick. Once the dust settles, the weight of old habits takes over and they pull the stick back, reverting to their toxic behavior. Some parents may acknowledge a few of the things you say but be unwilling to do anything about it. The line I hear most often is, "I've said I'm sorry, what more do you want?"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Your response: "I appreciate your apology, but that's just a beginning. If you're truly sorry, you'll be available to me when I need you and you'll work through this with me to make a better relationship."</div>

<div class="line_en">"We did the best we could." Those parents who either were inadequate or were silent partners to abuse will frequently deal with confrontation in the same passive, ineffectual ways as they've traditionally used to deal with problems. These parents will remind you of how tough they had it while you were growing up and how hard they struggled. They'll say such things as, "You'll never understand what I was going through,"</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You don't know how many times I tried to get him/her to stop," or, "I did the best I could." This particular style of response may stir up a lot of sympathy and compassion for your parents. This is understandable, but it makes it difficult for you to remain focused on what you need to say in your confrontation. The temptation is for you once again to put their needs ahead of your own. It's important that you acknowledge their difficulties without invalidating yours.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Look what we did for you." Many parents will attempt to counter your assertions by recalling the wonderful times you had as a child and the loving moments you and they shared. By focusing on the good things, they can avoid looking at the darker side of their behavior. Parents will typically remind you of gifts they gave you, places they took you, sacrifices they made for you, and thoughtful things they did. They'll say things like, "This is the thanks we get," or, "Nothing was ever enough for you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"How can you do this to me?" Some parents act like martyrs. They'll collapse into tears, wring their hands, and express shock and disbelief at your "cruelty." They will act as if your confrontation has victimized them. They'll accuse you of hurting them or disappointing them. They'll complain that they don't need this, they have enough problems. They'll tell you they're not strong enough or healthy enough to take this, that the heartache will kill them. Some of their sadness will, of course, be genuine. It is sad for parents to face their own shortcomings, to realize they have caused their children significant pain. But their sadness can also be manipulative and controlling. It is their way of using guilt to try to make you back down.</div>

<div class="line_en">Immediately after your confrontation, you may experience a sudden rush of euphoria from your newfound courage and strength. You may be flooded with relief at having finally put the confrontation behind you, even if it didn't go exactly the way you had hoped. You may feel a lot lighter for having said many of the things you were holding in for so long. But you may also feel severely off balance or disappointed. You will certainly continue to feel anxious about what's going to happen next.</div>

<div class="line_en">Joe's confrontation was explosive and frustrating, but it was actually a great success.

<div class="line_en">Regardless of your initial reaction, it takes some time to feel the full and lasting benefits of confrontation. You'll need several weeks or even months to begin to experience the real empowerment that confrontation can give you. And you will experience it. Ultimately, you'll feel neither the extremes of euphoria nor disappointment. Instead, you'll enjoy a steadily increasing sense of well-being and confidence.</div>

<div class="line_en">If a parent does react angrily after the confrontation, you may feel a great temptation to counterattack. Avoid inflammatory statements like, "That's just like you," or, "I can never trust anything you say." It's very important that you stick to your nondefensive guns, or you'll hand your newly won power right back to your parents. Instead, say things like the following:</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">For example, a confrontation that appears to end positively can turn around once your parents have time to think about it. They may experience delayed reactions. They may have been relatively calm during the confrontation, only to start in with angry recriminations later on, accusing you of creating destructive upheaval in the family.</div>

<div class="line_en">On the other hand, I've seen confrontations that ended in anger and turmoil eventually lead to positive changes in clients' interactions with their parents.

When her mother went into recovery, her father fell apart. His self-worth had depended largely on his playing the powerful adequate parent. With his wife no longer leaning on him, his role in the family lost its meaning. Their marriage had been built on a certain pattern of interrelating that no longer applied. They didn't know how to communicate, they had no balance, and they'd lost their common ground. Carla had mixed feelings about this.</div>

<div class="line_en">While this book focuses primarily on your relationship with your parents, confrontation doesn't occur in a vacuum. You are part of a family system, and everyone else in that system will be affected. Just as your relationship with your parents will never be the same after confrontation, your relationship with your siblings will change as well.</div>

<div class="line_en">After Carol's father received his letter, he called and gave her some unexpected support. He told her that he didn't remember the things she had written about in her letter as she remembered them, but he apologized for any pain he had caused her. Carol was deeply touched and excited about the possibility of a new relationship with her father. Within a few weeks, however, she was devastated by a second conversation with him, in which he not only denied the experiences she had written about but denied having apologized as well. Then, to add insult to injury, Carol's younger brother called and verbally attacked her for daring to "spread disgusting lies" about their father. He told her she had a "sick mind" for accusing their father of having been abusive with her.</div>

I was an absolute basket case. When I opened the door I could see she'd been crying. We threw our arms around each other and just held each other for a long time. We talked and we cried and we hugged and we laughed and we cried some more. We went over all of it. Judy remembered some things I'd totally forgotten and she was really glad to be talking about it. She told me if it weren't for me she might have kept all this inside for God knows how long. She felt so much closer to me. She didn't feel so alone with all of this garbage.

Others may side with you. As with your parents and your siblings, it is important to deal with each family member on his or her own terms and remind each one that you are taking positive steps for your own well-being and that they should not feel compelled to take sides.</div>

All of your doubts, second thoughts, and even the yearnings to return to the status quo are common. Toxic parents will do almost anything to regain the familiar and comfortable family balance. They can be incredibly seductive when they sing their siren songs of guilt, pity, or blame.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It is not easy to hold your ground while your family adjusts around you. Facing the consequences of your new behavior is one of the bravest things you will ever ask of yourself. But it will also be one of the most rewarding.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Once the dust begins to settle and you have a chance to take a look at the effect of your confrontation on your relationship with your parents, you will discover that there are three options available to you.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">In my experience, toxic parents rarely follow through on their threats to excommunicate their children from the family. They are much too enmeshed and tend to resist drastic changes. However, there are no guarantees. I have seen parents who have cut their children out of their lives, who have made good on threats to disinherit them or stop whatever financial help they were providing. You must be emotionally and psychologically prepared for this or any other reaction.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">First, let's say that your parents have shown some capacity for understanding your pain and have acknowledged even a small part of their responsibility for the conflicts between you. If they indicate some willingness to continue to discuss, to explore, and to share feelings and concerns with you, there is a good chance that you will be able to build, together, a less toxic relationship. You can become your parents' teacher, instructing them in the fine art of treating you as an equal and communicating without criticism or attack. You can teach them how to express their own feelings without fear. You can teach them what does and does not feel good to you in the relationship. I won't pretend that this is what happens most of the time, or even much of the time, but it does happen some of the time. You can't know what their resources are until you push them to the crucial test of confrontation.</div>

</div>
<div class="line_en">The third and final option is to give up your relationship with your parents altogether, for the sake of your well-being. Some parents are so relentlessly antagonistic after confrontation that they escalate their toxic behaviors. If this happens, you may be forced to choose between them and your emotional health. You've been shortchanging yourself all your life; now it's time for a new accounting system.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Second, if your parents show little capacity for change in your relationship, if they go right back to "business as usual," you may decide that the healthiest thing for you to do is to stay in contact with them but on significantly less demanding terms. I've worked with many people who were unwilling to totally cut off their parents but were equally unwilling to return to the status quo. These people chose to pull back, establishing a cordial but somewhat superficial relationship with their parents. They stopped exposing their innermost feelings and vulnerabilities; instead, they limited their conversations to emotionally neutral topics. They established new ground rules about the nature of their contact with their parents. This middle position seems to work well for many of my clients and it might work well for you. It's okay to stay in contact with toxic parents as long as the relationship does not require you to sacrifice your mental health.</div>

<div class="line_en">When the moratorium is over, you need to assess whether your parents have softened their position. Ask them for a meeting to discuss it. If they have not changed, you can either try another moratorium or make the ultimate choice to break off from them completely.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">There is no way to face this third option without a considerable amount of pain, but there is a way to manage the pain: trial separation. Take a break from your parents. No contact for at least three months. That means no meetings, no phone calls, no letters. I call this "detox" time because it gives all involved a chance to get some of the poison out of their systems and to evaluate how much the relationship means to them. This moratorium on contact may be difficult, but it can be a time of enormous growth. Without the need to expend large amounts of energy on your conflicts with your parents, you'll have much more energy available for your own life. Once you have gained emotional distance, you and your parents might even rediscover some genuine positive feelings for one another.</div>

<div class="line_en">Joe's father, Alan, remained furious long after the confrontation. He continued to drink heavily. After several weeks, he had his wife, Joanne, deliver a message to Joe: if Joe wanted to see his father again, Joe needed to apologize. His mother called almost daily, pleading with Joe to acquiesce to his father's demand so that, in her words, "we can be a family again."</div>

<div class="line_en">If you decide that a final break is the only way you can preserve your well-being, I urge you to get professional counseling to help you through. During this time the frightened child inside you will need a lot of reassurance and calming. A sympathetic counselor can help you nurture that child while at the same time guiding the adult through the anxiety and pain of saying goodbye.</div>

<div class="line_en">Joe sadly realized that the distortions of reality in his family would continue to impair his mental health. He wrote his parents a brief letter telling them that he was taking a ninety-day vacation from the relationship, during which time he hoped they might reconsider their positions. He offered to meet with them again after the ninety days to see if there was anything worth salvaging.</div>

<div class="line_en">I had really hoped I'd be strong enough to keep up a relationship with them and not get so bent out of shape by their craziness. But right now I know that that's asking too much of myself. So, since it seems to be a choice between them or me, I choose me. This is probably the healthiest thing I've ever done, but understand what's going on: one minute I feel proud of myself and really strong, and the next minute I feel really empty inside. God, Susan, I don't know if I can handle being healthy -- I mean, what's that going to feel like?</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Though it was painful for Joe to break off from his parents, his demonstration of resolve gave him a new sense of inner strength. He began to feel more self-assured when he met women, and within six months had developed a love relationship that he told me was the most stable he had ever had. As his self-worth continued to improve, so did his life.</div>

<div class="line_en">Whether you negotiate with your parents for a better relationship, pull back to a more superficial relationship, or sever your relationship altogether, you will have taken an enormous step toward disconnecting from the power of the past. Once you break the old, ritualistic patterns with toxic parents, you'll be much more open and available for a truly loving relationship with yourself and others.</div>

<div class="line_en">I do not want to minimize the difficulties involved, but the fact that a parent is old or has a chronic illness does not necessarily mean that confrontation is out of the question. I do advise my clients to discuss the ramifications of emotional stress with their parent's physician to determine whether there is any significant medical risk. If so, there are alternatives to direct confrontation that still enable you to tell your truth, even if you have chosen not to tell it to your parent. You can write confrontation letters that you don't mail, you can read these letters to photographs of your parent, you can talk to siblings or other family members, or if you are in therapy, you can confront your parent in role-playing. I will discuss these techniques in more detail in the following section on "Confrontation with a Dead Parent."</div>

<div class="line_en">Confrontation with Sick or Old Parents</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Many of my clients find themselves in a painful dilemma about confrontation when their parents are very elderly, frail, or disabled. They are often caught up in powerfully conflicting feelings of pity and resentment. Some feel a strong sense of basic human obligation to care for their parents coupled with hypersensitivity to their demands. "What's the use," they say. "I wish I had done it years ago. They can't even remember." Or, "Mom would have another stroke if I confronted her. Why don't I let her go to the grave in peace?" And yet, without a confrontation, they know it will be harder to find peace for themselves.</div>

<div class="line_en">These techniques have also proven effective for a handful of my clients who are full-time caretakers of one or both parents. If your parent is living with you and is dependent on you, your efforts to deal more openly with your relationship may diminish the tensions between you, making your caretaker role easier. But it's also possible that confrontation may create such discord that your living situation becomes intolerable. If your current living arrangements make it impossible for you to get some distance from your parents should your confrontation alienate them further, you may choose some of the alternatives to direct confrontation.</div>

<div class="line_en">Jonathan, whom we met in chapter 4, avoided involvement with a woman because he was still rebelling against his mother, who continually pressured him to marry. After a few months of therapy, he decided that there were many things he would like to say to his mother, who was eighty-two. Since her heart attack a few years earlier, she had been frail, but she nevertheless, continued her intrusive phone calls and letters. His visits with her were painful charades.</div>

<div class="line_en">I feel so sorry for her, yet I get really angry at the power she has over me. But I'm afraid that if I say anything now, it will kill her, and I'm not willing to have that on my conscience. So I just put on my good-boy act. Why couldn't I have spoken up fifteen or twenty years ago when she was a lot stronger? I could have saved myself a lot of pain.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">At this point I reminded Jonathan that confrontation doesn't mean blasting the other person. If we could find a way for him to release some of his hurt and angry feelings in a controlled and gentle way, he would discover that there is always more peace to be found in truth than in avoidance. I didn't want to push him to do something that could have consequences he couldn't live with, but there was a very real chance that an honest interchange with his mother would enrich the quality of their relationship.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">I told him about current work being done with ill and dying parents and their adult children that indicates that an honest exploration of the relationship not only doesn't harm the parents, but often provides closure and comfort to all involved.</div>

<div class="line_en">I got the ball rolling by asking her if she had any idea how I felt about our relationship. She said she wondered why I always seemed so irritable around her. That opened the door for me to quietly talk to her about how her need to control me had affected my life. We talked for hours. I said things I never thought I'd be able to say. She got defensive… she got hurt… she denied a lot… but some of it got through. A couple of times her eyes filled with tears and she squeezed my hand. The relief was unbelievable. I used to dread seeing her, but she's just a frail little old lady. I can't believe how many years I was afraid of expressing myself to her.</div>

He could now respond to her current reality, which was very different from the powerful, engulfing mother the little boy inside him remembered.</div>

<div class="line_en">One method I've devised, which has proved to be very powerful, is to write a confrontation letter and read it aloud at your parent's grave. This gives you a strong sense of actually talking to your parent and of finally being able to express the things you've been holding inside for so long. Through the years I've received very positive reports, from both clients and from members of my radio audience, as a result of these graveside confrontations.</div>

<div class="line_en">Confrontation with a Dead Parent</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It's extremely frustrating when you've worked hard to get to the point of confrontation, but one or both of your parents are dead. Surprisingly, there are several ways to have a confrontation even though your parents may not be physically present.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Jonathan's confrontation with his mother had some positive results, but this is not always the case. Age or illness doesn't necessarily make toxic parents more able to deal with the truth. Some may mellow in later years, and coming face-to-face with their own mortality may make them more receptive to taking some responsibility for their behavior. But others will become more entrenched in their denial, their abuse, and their anger as they feel their life slipping away. Their assaults on you may be the only way they know to fend off their depression and panic. These parents may go to their graves angry and vindictive without ever acknowledging you. It doesn't matter. What does matter is that you've said what must be said.</div>

<div class="line_en">You may get the same negative reaction you would have gotten from your parents if they were alive. The relative may react with denial, disbelief, anger, or hurt, in which case you should do exactly what you would have done with your parent: stay nonreactive and nondefensive. This is a wonderful opportunity to reinforce your understanding that the responsibility to change is yours, not theirs.</div>

<div class="line_en">On the other hand, the family member may give you some surprising validation and even an apology on your parents' behalf. This happened to Kim -- whose father controlled her with money and unpredictable moods. Even though her father had been dead for more than five years, she felt the need to confront some member of the family. She decided on her father's younger sister, Shirley, and invited her to lunch.</div>

<div class="line_en">If it is not practical for you to go to your parent's grave, read your letter to a photograph of the parent, to an empty chair, or to someone in your support system who is willing to stand in for your parent.</div>

<div class="line_en">You have one more option: you can talk to a relative, preferably from the same generation as your dead parent (s). Tell that family member (preferably a close blood relative) about your experiences with your parents.

<div class="line_en">You know, everybody was always in awe of my father. He was the superstar of the family and Shirley always acted like she adored him. So you can imagine how hard it was for me to tell her what a bastard he had been to me. But the damnedest thing happened when I did. She told me she had always been afraid of my father, that he was horrible to her when they were kids, and that she wasn't at all surprised by anything I was telling her. Then she told me -- and this was the best -- that about eight years ago she gave him a brown shirt for his birthday -- you know, the kind the Nazis used to wear. She said she wanted to sew a swastika on it but that would have been going too far. We laughed, we cried, it was wonderful. The people at the restaurant must have thought we were nuts.</div>

<div class="line_en">When Shirley opened up to Kim, she was saying, in essence, "I understand how you feel and I know that it's all real and true." Kim found that by taking the experience back to the generation from which it came, she was able to release a lot of her pent-up anxiety and guilt about the reality of what her father had done to her.</div>

<div class="line_en">I realize that this technique may seem unkind, since in most cases these relatives are not responsible for your negative experiences. But you have to weigh the pros against the cons.
