<div class="line_en">You don't know about me without you have read a book by the name of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer; but that ain't no matter. That book was made by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly. There was things which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth. That is nothing. I never seen anybody but lied one time or another, without it was Aunt Polly, or the widow, or maybe Mary. Aunt Polly – Tom's Aunt Polly, she is – and Mary, and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book, which is mostly a true book, with some stretchers, as I said before.</div>

<div class="line_en">Now the way that the book winds up is this: Tom and me found the money that the robbers hid in the cave, and it made us rich. We got six thousand dollars apiece – all gold. It was an awful sight of money when it was piled up. Well, Judge Thatcher he took it and put it out at interest, and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year round – more than a body could tell what to do with. The Widow Douglas she took me for her son, and allowed she would sivilize me; but it was rough living in the house all the time, considering how dismal regular and decent the widow was in all her ways; and so when I couldn't stand it no longer I lit out. I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead again, and was free and satisfied. But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up and said he was going to start a band of robbers, and I might join if I would go back to the widow and be respectable. So I went back.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那本书的结尾是这样：汤姆和我找到了强盗藏在那个山洞里的钱，我们发了。我们俩，一人得了六千多块钱金灿灿的六千块。把钱堆积起来，乍一看，好不吓人。后来，由撒切尔法官拿去存放利息，我们俩每人每天得一块钱，一年到头，天天这样真是多得叫人没法办。道格拉斯寡妇，她把我认做她的干儿子，她许下了愿，要教我文明规矩。可是一天到晚，憋在这间屋里，有多难受。你想，寡妇的言行举止，一桩桩，一件件，全都那么呆板，那么一本正经，这有多丧气。如果继续这样，到了我实在忍受不了的那一天，我就要溜之大吉啦。我重新穿上了我原来的破衣烂衫，重新钻进了那只原本装糖的大木桶，好不痛快，好不逍遥自在。可是汤姆想方设法找到了我，说他要发起组织一个强盗帮，要是我能回到寡妇家，过得体体面面，就可以加入到他们里面去，于是我就回去了。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">The widow she cried over me, and called me a poor lost lamb, and she called me a lot of other names, too, but she never meant no harm by it. She put me in them new clothes again, and I couldn't do nothing but sweat and sweat, and feel all cramped up. Well, then, the old thing commenced again. The widow rung a bell for supper, and you had to come to time. When you got to the table you couldn't go right to eating, but you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little over the victuals, though there warn't really anything the matter with them, – that is, nothing only everything was cooked by itself. In a barrel of odds and ends it is different; things get mixed up, and the juice kind of swaps around, and the things go better.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="寡妇对我大哭了一场，把我叫做一只迷途的羔羊，还叫我别的好多名称，不过，她绝对没有任何恶意。她让我又穿上了新衣裳，我只是直冒汗，憋得难受实在一点办法也没有。啊，这么一来，又重新开始那老一套。寡妇打铃开饭，你就得按时到。到了饭桌子跟前，你可不能马上就吃起来，你得等着，等寡妇低下头来，朝饭菜叽哩咕噜挑剔几句，尽管这些饭菜没什么好挑剔的，因为每道菜都是精心做的。要是一桶乱七杂八的东西，那就不一样了，各样菜掺和在一起烧，连汤带水，味道就格外鲜美。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the Bulrushers, and I was in a sweat to find out all about him; but by and by she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time; so then I didn't care no more about him, because I don't take no stock in dead people.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="晚饭后，她就拿出那本书来，给我讲摩西和蒲草箱的故事。我急得直冒汗，急着要弄清楚一切有关他的事。不过，她隔了一会儿却说摩西是死了很久很久的事了。这样，我就不再为他担忧什么了，因为我对死了的人是毫无兴趣的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Pretty soon I wanted to smoke, and asked the widow to let me. But she wouldn't. She said it was a mean practice and wasn't clean, and I must try to not do it any more. That is just the way with some people. They get down on a thing when they don't know nothing about it. Here she was a-bothering about Moses, which was no kin to her, and no use to any -- body, being gone, you see, yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a thing that had some good in it. And she took snuff, too; of course that was all right, because she done it herself.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="没过多久，我请求寡妇答应我抽烟。可是她死活不肯。她说这是一种下流的习惯，又不卫生，要我从此戒掉。世界上有些人就是这样行事。一件事，来龙去脉，一窍不通，可偏偏要谈三论四。比如摩西，与她非亲非故，对谁都没有什么用处，很早就死了，她偏要为他操心；可我做一件事，明明也没有错，可她偏要找岔儿。况且，她自己就吸鼻烟，那当然是做得对喽，因为她就是这么做的嘛。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Her sister, Miss Watson, a tolerable slim old maid, with goggles on, had just come to live with her, and took a set at me now with a spelling-book. She worked me middling hard for about an hour, and then the widow made her ease up. I couldn't stood it much longer. Then for an hour it was deadly dull, and I was fidgety. Miss Watson would say, "Don't put your feet up there, Huckleberry;" and "Don't scrunch up like that, Huckleberry – set up straight;" and pretty soon she would say, "Don't gap and stretch like that, Huckleberry – why don't you try to be -- have?" Then she told me all about the bad place, and I said I wished I was there. She got mad then, but I didn't mean no harm. All I wanted was to go somewheres; all I wanted was a change, I warn't particular. She said it was wicked to say what I said; said she wouldn't say it for the whole world; she was going to live so as to go to the good place. Well, I couldn't see no advantage in going where she was going, so I made up my mind I wouldn't try for it. But I never said so, because it would only make trouble, and wouldn't do no good.</div>

<div class="line_en">Now she had got a start, and she went on and told me all about the good place. She said all a body would have to do there was to go around all day long with a harp and sing, forever and ever. So I didn't think much of it. But I never said so. I asked her if she reckoned Tom Sawyer would go there, and she said not by a considerable sight. I was glad about that, because I wanted him and me to be together.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她话匣子既然打开了，便不停地说下去，把有关那个好地方的一切，跟我说个没完没了。她说，在那边，一个人整天干的，就是这里走走，那里逛逛，一边弹着琴，一边唱着歌。永永远远如此这般。不过我对这些不怎么挂在心上，只是我从没有说出口来。我问她，依她看，汤姆是否会去那，她说，他还差一截子呢。听了这话，我满心欢喜，因为我要他跟我在一起。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Miss Watson she kept pecking at me, and it got tiresome and lonesome. By and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers, and then everybody was off to bed. I went up to my room with a piece of candle, and put it on the table. Then I set down in a chair by the window and tried to think of something cheerful, but it warn't no use. I felt so lonesome I most wished I was dead. The stars were shining, and the leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful; and I heard an owl, away off, who-whooing about some -- body that was dead, and a whippowill and a dog cry -- ing about somebody that was going to die; and the wind was trying to whisper something to me, and I couldn't make out what it was, and so it made the cold shivers run over me. Then away out in the woods I heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about something that's on its mind and can't make itself understood, and so can't rest easy in its grave, and has to go about that way every night grieving. I got so down-hearted and scared I did wish I had some company. Pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder, and I flipped it off and it lit in the candle; and before I could budge it was all shriveled up. I didn't need anybody to tell me that that was an awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck, so I was scared and most shook the clothes off of me. I got up and turned around in my tracks three times and crossed my breast every time; and then I tied up a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away. But I hadn't no confidence. You do that when you've lost a horseshoe that you've found, instead of nailing it up over the door, but I hadn't ever heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you'd killed a spider.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="因为华珍小姐不停地找我的岔子，日子过得又累又孤单。后来，她们招了些黑奴来，教他们做祷告，然后一个个地去睡觉。我上楼走进我的房间，手里拿着一支蜡烛，把它放在桌上，然后在一张靠窗的椅子上坐下来，存心拣些有劲儿的事想想，可就是做不到。我只觉得孤单寂寞，真是恨不得死去才好。星星在一闪一闪，林子里树叶在沙沙作响。我听见一只狼在远处正为死者凄惨地哀鸣；猫头鹰还有一只夜鹰和一条狗正在为一个快死去的人嚎叫；还有那风声正想要在我耳边低声诉说，我捉摸不透它们在诉说着什么。如此这般，不由得使我浑身一阵阵颤抖。我又听见远处林子里鬼魂声响。这个鬼，每逢他要把存在心头的话说出来，却又说不清楚的时候，便在坟墓里安不下身来，非得每个夜晚悲悲切切地到处飘飘荡荡。我真是失魂落魄，十分恐惧，但愿身边有个伴。一会儿，一只蜘蛛爬到我肩上，我一抹，将它抹到了蜡烛火头上。我没有动一个指头，它就烧焦了。不用别人告诉我，我也明白，这是个不祥之兆，我认定要有祸事临头，因此十分害怕，几乎把身上的衣服抖落在地。我站起身来，就地转了三圈，每转一圈，就在胸前划个十字，接着用线把头上一小撮头发给扎起来，让妖怪不能近身。不过，我还是不放心。人家只有把找到的一块马蹄铁给弄丢了，没有能钉在门上，才会这么做的，可从没听说，弄死了一只蜘蛛，也用这个办法消灾避祸。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">I set down again, a-shaking all over, and got out my pipe for a smoke; for the house was all as still as death now, and so the widow wouldn't know. Well, after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town go boom – boom – boom – twelve licks; and all still again – stiller than ever. Pretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the trees – something was a stirring. I set still and listened. Directly I could just barely hear a "me-yow! me -- yow!" down there. That was good! Says I, "me -- yow! me-yow!" as soft as I could, and then I put out the light and scrambled out of the window on to the shed. Then I slipped down to the ground and crawled in among the trees, and, sure enough, there was Tom Sawyer waiting for me.</div>
