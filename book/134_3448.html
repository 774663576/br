<div class="line_en">Richard had his hands on her arms. They were standing under a thing that looked like a beaded crescent, or a section of a starfish, that hung from the hall ceiling. It was ugly, but the Semco family attributed almost magical powers to it, and hung it up on special occasions. Richard's grandfather had brought it from Russia.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="理查德把手放在她的手臂上。他们的头顶上有个东西挂在天花板上，看起来像是串着珠子的弦月，也像截了一段的海星，看起来很丑，但桑姆科这家人却认定这个东西带有神奇的魔力，只要有特殊场合就会挂出来。这东西是理查德的祖父从俄罗斯带过来的。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Even on the second floor, the house trembled with the crazy dancing below, the dancing that had nothing to do with the music. Therese heard another glass fall, and pictured the pink foamy eggnog rolling across the floor. This was tame compared to the real Russian Christmases they had used to celebrate in the first week in January, Richard said. Richard smiled at her as he closed the door of his room.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="到了二楼，房子依然因为一楼众人的狂舞而颤动，他们的舞蹈和音乐完全搭配不上。特芮丝听到有个杯子落地的声音，脑中出现冒着泡沫的粉红蛋酒流在地板上的画面。理查德说，这个场面和他们一月第一个礼拜庆祝的真正的俄罗斯圣诞节相比，简直是小巫见大巫。理查德关上房门，对着特芮丝笑了。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"This'd be good for you."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“对你有好处。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"How about a real shot? That stuff downstairs is sickening." Richard got his bottle of whisky from his closet floor.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“要不要来杯真正的酒？下面喝的东西好恶心。”理查德从柜子底下拿出一瓶威士忌。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I like my sweater," he said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我好喜欢你送的毛衣。”他说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"I'm glad." Therese swept her full skirt in an arc and sat on the edge of Richard's bed. The heavy Norwegian sweater she had given Richard was on the bed behind her, lying across its tissued box. Richard had given her a skirt from an East India shop, a long skirt with green and gold bands and embroidery. It was lovely, but Therese did not know where she could ever wear it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我很高兴。”特芮丝把裙子拢起来，坐在理查德的床沿。她送给理查德的那件厚厚的挪威毛衣正放在床上，就在她身边，摊在薄纸盒上。理查德从东印度商店买了一件长裙子送她，上面有绿色和金色的带子和绣花。裙子很漂亮，但特芮丝不知道这件裙子适合搭配什么场合。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Therese shook her head. "No, thanks."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特芮丝摇摇头。“不，谢了。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She shook her head again. She looked around her at the high-ceilinged, almost square room, at the wallpaper with the barely discernible pattern of pink roses, at the two peaceful windows curtained in slightly yellowed white muslin. From the door, there were two pale trails in the green carpet, one to the bureau and one to the desk in the corner. The pot of brushes and the portfolio on the floor by the desk were the only signs of Richard's painting. Just as painting took up only a corner of his brain, she felt, and she wondered how much longer he would go on with it before he dropped it for something else. And she wondered, as she had often wondered before, if Richard liked her only because she was more sympathetic with his ambitions than anyone else he happened to know now, and because he felt her criticism was a help to him. Therese got up restlessly and went to the window. She loved the room -- because it stayed the same and stayed in the same place -- yet today she felt an impulse to burst from it. She was a different person from the one who had stood here three weeks ago. This morning she had awakened in Carol's house. Carol was like a secret spreading through her, spreading through this house, too, like a light invisible to everyone but her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她又摇了摇头。她环顾这间挑高的、几乎是正方形的房间，壁纸上的粉红玫瑰图案十分模糊，两扇平静的窗上装着略带黄色的白色棉布窗帘。绿色的地毯上有两道模糊的痕迹，从门边为起点，一道向着五斗柜，一道向着角落的书桌。房间里唯一出现的理查德作画的迹象是一个装着画笔的罐子，和书桌旁地板上的作品集。她想，在理查德心里，画画只占了一小部分，不知道什么时候他就会放弃画画，开始做别的事情了。她一直在想，理查德喜欢她的原因，是不是因为她比其他人更加支持他的画画志向，是不是因为她对他作品的批评有助于他的进步。特芮丝不安地站了起来，走到窗边。她很喜欢这个房间（因为这里一直保持原样，一直在这里），但今天她有一股冲动，想要从这里跑出去。跟三个礼拜前站在这里的她相比，现在的她已经是个完全不同的人了。今天早上她是在卡罗尔的家里醒来的。卡罗尔就像她身上的秘密，扩散到整个房子里；也像一道光，只有她才看得见，别人都看不见。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">She was wearing a blue taffeta dress that was God knows how old, that she hadn't put on since her first months in New York. She sat down on the bed again, and looked at Richard who stood in the middle of the floor with the little glass of straight whisky in his hand, his clear blue eyes moving from her face to her feet in the new high-heeled black shoes, back to her face again.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她穿着一件蓝色的薄绸连衣裙，已经非常陈旧了，来纽约没多久之后就没穿过了。她坐在床上再度看着理查德，理查德站在房间中央，手上拿着一小杯没加冰块的威士忌。他澄澈的蓝眼睛从她的脸移到她脚上的黑色新高跟鞋，然后又回到她的脸上。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Terry." Richard took her hands, pinned her hands to the bed on either side of her. The smooth, thin lips descended on hers, firmly, with the flick of his tongue between her lips and the aromatic smell of fresh whisky. "Terry, you're an angel," Richard's deep voice said, and she thought of Carol saying the same thing.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“小芮。”理查德抓起她的手，把她的手压在她身体两边，他平滑的薄唇往下稳稳地落在她的嘴唇上，舌头轻触她的双唇，飘出新鲜威士忌的香味。“小芮，你真是个天使。”理查德用深沉的声音说道。她想起卡罗尔也说过同样的话。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"You're different today," Richard said so abruptly that a thrill of peril passed down her body.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“你今天怎么怪怪的。”理查德突然这么说，令她打了一阵寒颤。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">She watched him pick up his little glass from the floor and set it with the bottle into the closet. She felt immensely superior to him suddenly, to all the people below stairs. She was happier than any of them.</div>

<div class="line_en">"Pretty?" Richard said.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“漂亮吗？”理查德说。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Happiness was a little like flying, she thought, like being a kite. It depended on how much one let the string out --</div>

<div class="line_en">"I finished it last night. I thought if it was a good day, we'd go to the park and fly it." Richard grinned like a boy, proud of his handiwork.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“我昨晚做完的。我在想如果天气好，我们就可以到公园去放风筝。”理查德咧着嘴笑，像个男孩一样，对自己的手工沾沾自喜。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">It was a Russian kite, rectangular and bowed like a shield, its slim frame notched and tied at the corners. On the front, Richard had painted a cathedral with whirling domes and a red sky behind it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那是个长方形的俄罗斯风筝，像弓一样弯着，有如一面盾牌，纤细的骨架上刻有凹痕，四个角绑得牢牢的。理查德在正面画了一个圆顶教堂，后面是红色的天空。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Can't," Richard said, and added something in Russian, and Therese had a feeling she often had, seeing Richard with his family, that there must have been a mistake, that Richard might be an orphan himself, a changeling, left on the doorstep and brought up a son of this family. But there was his brother Stephen standing in the doorway, with Richard's blue eyes, though Stephen was even taller and thinner.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“不用了，”理查德回答道，然后用俄语补充了几句话。特芮丝每次看到理查德和家人在一起，就觉得其中一定弄错了，理查德一定是个孤儿，或被偷换的小孩，放在门前台阶上，然后这家人把他当成自己的儿子抚养长大。他弟弟史蒂芬站在门口，两人的蓝眼睛是一样的，但史蒂芬甚至还要高一点，比较瘦。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They carried the kite downstairs. Then everybody saw them and came into the hall, uncles,. aunts, and cousins, until the hall was a din and Richard had to hold the kite in the air to protect it. The noise irritated Therese, but Richard loved it.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们把风筝拿下楼，每个人都看见他们了，大家走进大厅，那些叔叔伯伯、姑姑阿姨和表兄弟姊妹，直到大厅里挤满了人，变得一片喧嚣。理查德把风筝高举在头上，免得被挤到。嘈杂的声音让特芮丝觉得不舒服，但理查德却很喜欢这样。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Stay for the champagne, Richard!" one of the aunts shouted, one of the aunts with a fat midriff straining like a second bosom under a satin dress.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“理查德，来喝香槟！”有个姑姑大声叫着。她锦缎连衣裙底下的腹部肥胖，看来好像另一个胸部一样臃肿。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">Someone had asked if they were going to fly the kite on the roof, and since the house hadn't a roof one could stand on, Richard's mother had gone off into peals of laughter. Then the dog began to bark.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="有人问他们是不是要在屋顶上放风筝，可是他们家的屋顶上面不能站人，理查德的母亲放声大笑。然后狗也开始吠了起来。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“我要替你做一件那种连衣裙。”理查德的母亲对着特芮丝喊，好像要提醒她似的摆动着手指。“我知道你的尺寸！”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Then she and Richard were free and alone, walking down the front sidewalk. It wouldn't be any different, if they were married, Therese thought, visiting the family on Christmas Day. Richard would fly his kites even when he was an old man, like his grandfather who had flown kites in Prospect Park until the year he died, Richard had told her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="她和理查德终于自由了，终于独处了，两人走在人行道上。特芮丝想，就算他们结婚，情况也还是一样，他们还是会在圣诞节前来探望他的家人。就算理查德以后老了，他也还是会放风筝，就像他祖父在公园放风筝一样，放到他去世为止。理查德是这样告诉她的。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They had measured her with a tape in the living room, in the midst of all the singing and present opening, and a couple of the men had tried to help, too. Mrs. Semco put her arm around Therese's waist, and suddenly Therese embraced her and kissed her firmly on the cheek, her lips sinking into the soft powdered cheek, in that one second pouring out in the kiss, and in the convulsive clasp of her arm, the affection Therese really had for her, that Therese knew would hide itself again as if it did not exist, in the instant she released her.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们在客厅用卷尺量过她的尺寸，就在唱歌和拆礼物的间隙，有几位男性也在帮忙。桑姆科太太用手环抱着特芮丝的腰，特芮丝则突然抱住她，在她脸上用力吻了一下，嘴唇陷入那片柔软的上了粉的脸颊。特芮丝亲下去的那一刻，在她手臂猛然一抱之际，特芮丝是真心喜欢她的，也知道这份真心的喜爱，会在她松开手的时候也随之消失隐没，仿佛从来不存在一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="理查德摆动长长的双臂，想把风筝拉高一点，但风筝还是在冰冷凝滞的空气中留在原处。教堂金色的圆顶从一边摆到另一边，仿佛整只风筝都在摇头说：“不要。”软绵绵的长尾巴愚蠢地跟在后头，重复那个“不”字。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">They took the subway to the park, and walked to the treeless hill where they had come a dozen times before. Therese looked around her. There were some boys playing with a football down on the flat field at the edge of the trees, but otherwise the park looked quiet and still. There was not much wind, not really enough, Richard said, and the sky was densely white as if it carried snow.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他们搭地铁到了公园，走到光秃秃的、没种树的小坡上面，两人已经来过这里十几次了。特芮丝环顾四周。在底下树林边的平地上有些男孩在踢足球，除此之外公园看起来安静平和。理查德说风不大，几乎没有风，天空是一片浓重的白色，像是要下雪一样。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="她照做了，就像玩弄着一条很长的橡皮筋一样。现在线这么长、这么松，她只能扯线让风筝晃晃。她一直拉、一直拉、一直拉；然后理查德过来把风筝线接了过去，特芮丝的手还拉着线。她的呼吸越来越急促，手臂上的一块小肌肉在颤抖。她在地上坐下来。她没有征服风筝，风筝没有照她的意思去飞。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">Suddenly the kite broke its mooring in the sky and tugged sharply to get away. Therese let the stick turn fast in her hands, as long as she dared to under Richard's eyes, because the kite was still low. And now it rested again, stubbornly still.</div>

<div class="line_en">Therese stood up. A bird flew under the kite. She stared at the rectangle that was growing smaller and smaller, jerking back and back like a snip's billowed sail going backward. She felt the kite meant something, this particular kite, at this minute.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特芮丝站了起来。有一只鸟飞过风筝下面。她盯着越来越小的长方形风筝，一直把线往后拉，就像船只飘动的帆一直往后拉一样。她感觉到这只风筝在此时此刻，代表了某种意义。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">At least he troubled to answer, Therese thought. What would you do if you were, she had an impulse to ask, but the question would hardly serve a purpose. She kept her eyes on the kite. They were both looking at the same kite, but with what different thoughts in their minds. "Did you ever hear of it?" she asked.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="特芮丝想，至少他还是不嫌麻烦回答了。她有一股冲动，想要问他如果他爱上了男生的话，会怎么办。可是这样问了也是白问。她的眼睛还是盯着风筝，两人看着同一只风筝，但心思却各不相同。“你听过这种事吗？”她问。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">"Hear of it? You mean people like that? Of course." Richard was standing straight now, winding the string in with figure-eight movements of the stick.</div>

<div class="line_cn" title="“对。”她说，她同意他的话。特芮丝也想过要探究背后的原因到底是什么。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">But that was nothing, nothing like what she felt for Carol. Was it love or wasn't it that she felt for Carol? And how absurd it was that she didn't even know. She had heard about girls falling in love, and she knew what kind of people they were and what they looked like. Neither she nor Carol looked like that. Yet the way she felt about Carol passed all the tests for love and fitted all the descriptions. "Do you think I could?"</div>

<div class="line_en">He went on, winding the kite. "But those things don't just happen. There's always some reason for it in the background."</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="他继续卷绕着风筝线。“事情不可能平白无故发生，背后一定有理由。”">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">The nearest she could remember to being "in love" was the way she had felt about a boy she had seen a few times in the town of Montclair, when she rode in the school bus. He had curly black hair and a handsome, serious face, and he had been perhaps twelve years old, older than she then. She remembered a short time when she had thought of him every day.</div>
