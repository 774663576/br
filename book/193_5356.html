<div class="line_en">Kohler was sickened by the opulence of the Hallway of the Belvedere. The gold leaf in the ceiling alone probably could have funded a year's worth of cancer research. Rocher led Kohler up a handicapped ramp on a circuitous route into the Apostolic Palace.</div>

<div class="line_en">Kohler knew he had very little time to accomplish what he had come for. He also knew he might die here tonight. He was surprised how little he cared.

<div class="line_en">The guards, cruelly it seemed, had stopped Kohler next to a full-length gilded mirror. The sight of his own twisted form repulsed Kohler. The ancient rage brimmed yet again to the surface. It empowered him. He was among the enemy now. These were the people who had robbed him of his dignity. These were the people. Because ofthem he had never felt the touch of a woman… had never stood tall to accept an award. What truth do these people possess? What proof, damn it! A book of ancient fables? Promises of miracles to come? Science creates miracles every day!</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="那些卫兵拦住寇勒的地方，旁边刚好是一面镀金的穿衣镜，感觉上好残酷。镜中自己扭曲的身影让寇勒很不想面对。那股旧日的怒气又涌了上来，给了他力量。他现在进入敌人的阵营裡了。这些就是夺走他尊严和体面的人，就是这些人。因为他们，让他从来没能感觉到女人的触摸……也从来无法抬头挺胸站著领奖。这些人拥有什麽真理？他们有什麽证据，该死！一本古老的寓言书？承诺将有奇蹟来临？科学天天都在创造奇蹟！">查看中文翻译</div>
