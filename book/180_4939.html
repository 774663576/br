<div class="line_en">(Certainly, Nancy had gone with them, since Minta Doyle had asked it with her dumb look, holding out her hand, as Nancy made off, after lunch, to her attic, to escape the horror of family life. She supposed she must go then. She did not want to go. She did not want to be drawn into it all. For as they walked along the road to the cliff Minta kept on taking her hand. Then she would let it go. Then she would take it again. What was it she wanted? Nancy asked herself. There was something, of course, that people wanted; for when Minta took her hand and held it, Nancy, reluctantly, saw the whole world spread out beneath her, as if it were Constantinople seen through a mist, and then, however heavy-eyed one might be, one must needs ask, "Is that Santa Sofia?" "Is that the Golden Horn?" So Nancy asked, when Minta took her hand. "What is it that she wants? Is it that?" And what was that? Here and there emerged from the mist (as Nancy looked down upon life spread beneath her) a pinnacle, a dome; prominent things, without names. But when Minta dropped her hand, as she did when they ran down the hillside, all that, the dome, the pinnacle, whatever it was that had protruded through the mist, sank down into it and disappeared.</div>

<div class="line_en">Minta, Andrew observed, was rather a good walker. She wore more sensible clothes that most women. She wore very short skirts and black knickerbockers. She would jump straight into a stream and flounder across. He liked her rashness, but he saw that it would not do -- she would kill herself in some idiotic way one of these days. She seemed to be afraid of nothing -- except bulls. At the mere sight of a bull in a field she would throw up her arms and fly screaming, which was the very thing to enrage a bull of course. But she did not mind owning up to it in the least; one must admit that. She knew she was an awful coward about bulls, she said. She thought she must have been tossed in her perambulator when she was a baby. She didn't seem to mind what she said or did. Suddenly now she pitched down on the edge of the cliff and began to sing some song about</div>

<div class="line_en">"Fatal," Paul agreed, springing up, and as they went slithering down, he kept quoting the guide-book about "these islands being justly celebrated for their park-like prospects and the extent and variety of their marine curiosities." But it would not do altogether, this shouting and damning your eyes, Andrew felt, picking his way down the cliff, this clapping him on the back, and calling him "old fellow" and all that; it would not altogether do. It was the worst of taking women on walks. Once on the beach they separated, he going out on to the Pope's Nose, taking his shoes off, and rolling his socks in them and letting that couple look after themselves; Nancy waded out to her own rocks and searched her own pools and let that couple look after themselves. She crouched low down and touched the smooth rubber-like sea anemones, who were stuck like lumps of jelly to the side of the rock. Brooding, she changed the pool into the sea, and made the minnows into sharks and whales, and cast vast clouds over this tiny world by holding her hand against the sun, and so brought darkness and desolation, like God himself, to millions of ignorant and innocent creatures, and then took her hand away suddenly and let the sun stream down. Out on the pale criss-crossed sand, high-stepping, fringed, gauntleted, stalked some fantastic leviathan (she was still enlarging the pool), and slipped into the vast fissures of the mountain side. And then, letting her eyes slide imperceptibly above the pool and rest on that wavering line of sea and sky, on the tree trunks which the smoke of steamers made waver on the horizon, she became with all that power sweeping savagely in and inevitably withdrawing, hypnotised, and the two senses of that vastness and this tininess (the pool had diminished again) flowering within it made her feel that she was bound hand and foot and unable to move by the intensity of feelings which reduced her own body, her own life, and the lives of all the people in the world, for ever, to nothingness. So listening to the waves, crouching over the pool, she brooded.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="“糟糕透了。”保罗跳起身来，同意道。当他们连滑带溜地向下走去时，他不断引用导游书上的话，“这些岛屿由于其公园般的美景和丰富多样的海珍品而受到应得的称赞”。但是这样做可不行，这样大声叫喊着你该死的眼睛，安德鲁一面小心冀翼地走下悬崖，一面在想，这样拍柏他的背，管他叫“总伙计”之类的事，这样做可真是不行。带女人散步这样做是最糟的。一到海滩他们就散开了，他脱掉鞋袜，把袜子卷起来塞在鞋里，涉水去到鸡屁股岩上，让那—对自便去吧；南希涉水去到她自己的岩石上寻找她自己的小水潭，也让那一对自便去了。她低低地蹲下身子，摸着滑溜溜的橡皮样的海葵，它们像一块块果冻紧贴在岩石壁上。她默默沉思，把小水潭想像成了大海，把各种小鱼想像成了鲨鱼和鲸鱼，用手挡住太阳，给这片小小的世界投下了团团乌云，像上帝一样，给千百万无知而无辜的生灵带去了黑暗和荒凄。然后她突然把手拿开，让阳光直泻而下。在那片灰白的、生灵交叉往来的沙地上，某个大海怪昂首阔步走来，带着缘缨和金属臂铠（她仍在继续扩大她那水潭），跃进了山边上的大裂沟中。这时她让自己的目光悄悄滑到水潭下方，停留在波动着的水天相接处、停留在轮船的烟雾中，在地平线上轻轻摇动的树干上，她成了大自然的神力的一部分，汹涌而来，又必然注定地退去，完全被迷住了；那一个的浩瀚和这一个的微小（水潭又变小了），这两种感觉强烈地出现其中，使她感到自己剧烈的感情把她的身体、她的生命、世上所有人的生命都变得永远微不足道，感到自己被捆住了手脚，欲动不能。她就这样蹲在水潭边，听着大海的涛声，默然沉思。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">It was not until they had climbed right up on to the top of the cliff again that Minta cried out that she had lost her grandmother's brooch -- her grandmother's brooch, the sole ornament she possessed -- a weeping willow, it was (they must remember it) the tears running down her cheeks, the brooch which her grandmother had fastened her cap with till the last day of her life. Now she had lost it. She would rather have lost anything than that! She would go back and look for it. They all went back. They poked and peered and looked. They kept their heads very low, and said things shortly and gruffly. Paul Rayley searched like a madman all about the rock where they had been sitting. All this pother about a brooch really didn't do at all, Andrew thought, as Paul told him to make a "thorough search between this point and that." The tide was coming in fast. The sea would cover the place where they had sat in a minute. There was not a ghost of a chance of their finding it now. "We shall be cut off!" Minta shrieked, suddenly terrified. As if there were any danger of that! It was the same as the bulls all over again -- she had no control over her emotions, Andrew thought. Women hadn't. The wretched Paul had to pacify her. The men (Andrew and Paul at once became manly, and different from usual) took counsel briefly and decided that they would plant Rayley's stick where they had sat and come back at low tide again. There was nothing more that could be done now. If the brooch was there, it would still be there in the morning, they assured her, but Minta still sobbed, all the way up to the top of the cliff. It was her grandmother's brooch; she would rather have lost anything but that, and yet Nancy felt, it might be true that she minded losing her brooch, but she wasn't crying only for that. She was crying for something else. We might all sit down and cry, she felt. But she did not know what for.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="直到他们爬回到悬崖顶上以后明塔才大叫，说她把奶奶给她的胸针给丢了——是她奶奶的胸针呀，她拥有的惟一的一件饰物——是用珍珠镶成的一棵垂柳（他们肯定记得的）。她们肯定看见过，她说。眼泪顶着脸直往下流，她奶奶用这只胸针来别住帽子，一直用到去世的那天。现在她给弄丢了。她宁可弄丢任何别的东西也不愿丢了这枚胸针！她得回去找。他们都一起回头去找。他们东翻西戳，眼睛四处搜寻。他们一直把头垂得低低的，生气地嘀咕着；保罗·雷勒像疯子似的在他们坐过的那块岩石四周到处寻找。当保罗叫安德鲁“好好把这儿到那儿给搜一下”时，安德鲁心想，这样乱哄哄地找一个胸针根本不行。潮水涨得很快。海水马上就会淹没他们刚才坐过的地方。想现在找到胸针是没有任何希望的。“潮水要切断我们的路了！”明塔突然感到非常害怕，尖声叫了起来。好像会有这种危险似的！又和公牛的情况一样——她丝毫也控制不住自己的情绪，安德鲁想，女人就是这样。可怜的保罗不得不去安慰她。男人们（安德鲁和保罗立刻变得男子汉一般，和平时不一样了）一起商量了一下，决定把雷勒的手杖插在他们俩坐过的地方，等退潮后再回来找。现在也只能这样了。如果胸针在那里，那么明天早上也仍旧会在那里，他们让她放心，但是明塔还是一路抽抽搭搭地哭着爬上了崖顶。那是她奶奶的胸针；她宁可弄丢任何别的东西也不愿丢了这枚胸针，然而南希却觉得，尽管她确实为丢了胸针而难过，但她也不光是为了这个在哭。她的哭还有别的原因。她觉得，我们都可以坐下来哭上一场。但是她并不知道为了什么。">查看中文翻译</div>
<div class="line_en">And Andrew shouted that the sea was coming in, so she leapt splashing through the shallow waves on to the shore and ran up the beach and was carried by her own impetuosity and her desire for rapid movement right behind a rock and there -- oh, heavens! in each other's arms, were Paul and Minta kissing probably. She was outraged, indignant. She and Andrew put on their shoes and stockings in dead silence without saying a thing about it. Indeed they were rather sharp with each other. She might have called him when she saw the crayfish or whatever it was, Andrew grumbled. However, they both felt, it's not our fault. They had not wanted this horrid nuisance to happen. All the same it irritated Andrew that Nancy should be a woman, and Nancy that Andrew should be a man, and they tied their shoes very neatly and drew the bows rather tight.</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="这时，安德鲁大喊涨潮了，于是她奔跳着水花四溅地涉过浅浅的海水回到岸上，跑上沙滩，出于鲁莽和快速活动的愿望，她一头冲到一块岩石后面，哎呀天哪！保罗和明培正在那儿拥抱！说不定还在接吻。她感到受到了侮辱，极其气愤。她和安德鲁一声不响、对此事一言不发，穿上了鞋袜。实际上，他们彼此还赌着气。她看见小龙虾还是什么东西的时候该叫他一声的，安德鲁咕哝道。不过他们俩都觉得这不是他们的过错。他们并没有希望会发生这种可怕的讨厌事情。但是不管怎样，南希竟然是个女的，这使安德鲁很不痛快，而安德鲁竟然是个男的，这使南希很不痛快。他们把鞋带系得很整齐，蝴蝶结打得很紧。">查看中文翻译</div>

<div class="line_en">They drew ahead together, Paul and Minta, and he comforted her, and said how famous he was for finding things. Once when he was a little boy he had found a gold watch. He would get up at daybreak and he was positive he would find it. It seemed to him that it would be almost dark, and he would be alone on the beach, and somehow it would be rather dangerous. He began telling her, however, that he would certainly find it, and she said that she would not hear of his getting up at dawn: it was lost: she knew that: she had had a presentiment when she put it on that afternoon. And secretly he resolved that he would not tell her, but he would slip out of the house at dawn when they were all asleep and if he could not find it he would go to Edinburgh and buy her another, just like it but more beautiful. He would prove what he could do. And as they came out on the hill and saw the lights of the town beneath them, the lights coming out suddenly one by one seemed like things that were going to happen to him -- his marriage, his children, his house; and again he thought, as they came out on to the high road, which was shaded with high bushes, how they would retreat into solitude together, and walk on and on, he always leading her, and she pressing close to his side (as she did now). As they turned by the cross roads he thought what an appalling experience he had been through, and he must tell some one -- Mrs Ramsay of course, for it took his breath away to think what he had been and done. It had been far and away the worst moment of his life when he asked Minta to marry him. He would go straight to Mrs Ramsay, because he felt somehow that she was the person who had made him do it. She had made him think he could do anything. Nobody else took him seriously. But she made him believe that he could do whatever he wanted. He had felt her eyes on him all day today, following him about (though she never said a word) as if she were saying, "Yes, you can do it. I believe in you. I expect it of you." She had made him feel all that, and directly they got back (he looked for the lights of the house above the bay) he would go to her and say, "I've done it, Mrs Ramsay; thanks to you." And so turning into the lane that led to the house he could see lights moving about in the upper windows. They must be awfully late then. People were getting ready for dinner. The house was all lit up, and the lights after the darkness made his eyes feel full, and he said to himself, childishly, as he walked up the drive, Lights, lights, lights, and repeated in a dazed way, Lights, lights, lights, as they came into the house staring about him with his face quite stiff. But, good heavens, he said to himself, putting his hand to his tie, I must not make a fool of myself.)</div>
<div class="line_cn" title="保罗和明塔一起走在前面，他安慰她，说他善于找东西是出了名的。他小时候有一次找到了一只金表。他明早天一亮就起来，肯定能找到胸针――在他想像中，那时天还是黑黑的，海滩上只有他自己，可能会挺危险的。但是他还是告诉她，他肯定能找得到，她说她可不想听什么他天一亮就起床：胸针是丢了；她知道：下午她往身上别的时候就有预感。他暗下决心，他不告诉她。但是明天一大早他们都还在熟睡时他就偷偷溜出去，如果找不到胸针，他就去爱丁堡给她买一枚和那个一样但更漂亮的胸针。他将要证明他的本事。当他们来到山顶时看见了山下小镇的灯光，灯光突然这样一个接一个地亮了起来，似乎就像他生活中将要发生的事情——他的婚姻，儿女，房子；当他们来到在高大的灌木丛阴影下的大路上时，他又想道，他们将一起过退隐的生活，他将领着她，她会紧紧依偎着他（就像现在这样）永远向前走去，他们在十字路口转弯时他心里在想，他已经有了多么令人震惊的经历，他必须要告诉什么人——当然是拉姆齐夫人了，因为一想到他刚才所做的事情就使他惊讶万分。当他向明塔求婚的时候无疑是他一生中最紧张的时刻。他要直接到拉姆齐夫人那儿去。因为他总觉得是她使他这样做的。是她使他觉得没有自己不能做的事。别人谁也不把他当回事。但是她使他相信，他想做的事都能做成。今天一整天他都感到她的目光在看着他。在追随着他，似乎在说（尽管她一个字也没有说过），“是的，你能做到。我相信你。我对你寄予希望。”她使他感到了这一切，他一回去（他寻找着海湾上方那所宅子的灯光）就到她那儿去对她说，“我办成了，拉姆齐夫人；多亏你了。”他们转上了通向宅子的小路，他看见楼上的窗子里移动着的灯光。这样看来他们一定回来得太晚了。大家都在准备吃晚饭了。宅子里灯火通明，从黑暗中出来，这使他的眼睛感到充溢着强光，他沿车道走近宅子时孩子气地自言自语道，灯光，灯光，灯光；并且在走进屋子以后，神情呆板地望着四周，茫然地重复着灯光，灯光，灯光。可是，天哪，他用手摸摸领带对自己说，我可别出洋相。">查看中文翻译</div>
